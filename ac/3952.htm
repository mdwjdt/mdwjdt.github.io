<h3 align="center" class="ired">属天的奥秘 第3952节</h3>
<h4 align="center"></h4><p><strong>3952.</strong>“那一夜雅各就与她同寝”表实际的结合。这是显而易见的，无需解释。在解释此前那些事的内义时，之所以只简单地给出它们的含义，是因为它们都是无法被理解的那类事，除非逐一阐述它们。因为所论述的主题是真理与良善，并良善与真理的结合，这种结合就是灵义上所指的婚姻关系；也就是构成人和教会里面的天上婚姻的结合。前面几节描述了这天上婚姻的奥秘，那里的说明如下：如前所述，天上的婚姻就是良善与真理，并真理与良善的婚姻；然而，不是属于同一层级的良善与真理之间的婚姻，而是一个属于较低层级，另一个属于较高层级的良善与真理之间的婚姻；也就是说，不是外在人的良善与外在人的真理之间的婚姻，而是外在人的良善与内在人的真理之间的婚姻，而是外在人的良善与内在人的真理之间的婚姻；或也可说，不是属世人的良善与属世人的真理之间的婚姻，而是属世人的良善与属灵人的真理之间的婚姻。这种结合构成婚姻，或说当属于不同层级的良善与真理相结合时，这婚姻便开始生效。<br />这同样适用于内在人或属灵人。在那里，天上的婚姻不是这人里面的良善与真理之间的婚姻，而是属灵人的良善与属天人的真理之间的婚姻；因为相对属灵人，属天人处于更高层级。天上的婚姻也不是属天人里面的良善与真理之间的婚姻，而是属天人的良善与从主发出的神性真理之间的婚姻。由此也明显可知，主的神性婚姻本身不是其神性人身里面的神性良善与神性真理的婚姻，而是神性人身的良善与神性本身之间，也就是子与父之间的婚姻；因为主的神性人身的良善在圣言中被称为“神的儿子”，神性本身被称为“父”。<br />这些就是包含在所说关于风茄那些事的内义里面的奥秘。谁都能看出，其中必然隐藏着某种奥秘。因为若非其中隐藏着神性事物，那么以下细节就太微不足道，在圣言的历史中根本不值得一提：流便在田里寻见风茄，拉结很想要它们，便以承诺她们的男人与利亚同寝来换取这些风茄；当晚上雅各从田里回来时，利亚出来迎接他说，她用风茄把他雇下了。没有人能准确知道所指的神性事物是什么，除非他知道雅各的众子和以他们命名的众支派分别表示什么；并且还知道属于在内义上所论述主题的观念流动；此外知道何为天上的婚姻，因为该婚姻就是所论述的主题；也就是说，所论述的主题是外在人的良善与内在人的真理情感的结合。<br />为了更好地理解这个奥秘，我进一步说明它。外在人的真理就是记忆知识，以及他先从父母、老师，然后从书本，最后通过自学所得来的教义事务。外在人的良善就是他在这些事物中所找到的乐趣和快乐。记忆知识本质上是真理，快乐本质上是良善，这二者结合在一起；但它们没有在他里面构成天上的婚姻，因为对那些陷入自我之爱和尘世之爱，因而陷入邪恶与虚假的人来说，记忆知识，甚至教义事务都与快乐相联结；但它们是伴随着自我之爱和尘世之爱的快乐，真理甚至能与这些爱相联结。这类人仍在天上的婚姻之外。不过，当本质上为外在人或属世人的良善的乐趣或快乐源于属灵之爱时，天上的婚姻就存在于人里面。也就是说，当这良善源于对邻、对自己的国家或公众，对教会、主国度之爱时，天上的婚姻就存在于他里面；当这良善源于属天之爱，也就是对主之爱时，天上的婚姻更是充分存在。因为当属灵或属天之爱从内在人或属灵人流入外在人或属世人的快乐，并形成这快乐时，这种与外在人或属世人的记忆知识并教义事务的结合就构成他里面的天上婚姻。不过，这种婚姻不可能存在于恶人身上，只存在于善人身上，也就是说，只存在于那些以这些事物为其目的的人身上。至于内在人或属灵人进入外在人或属世人的流注是何情形，前面早已说明（参看<a href="3286.htm">3286</a>，<a href="3288.htm">3288</a>，<a href="3314.htm">3314</a>，<a href="3321.htm">3321</a>节）。<br />一旦获悉这些奥秘，就能明白前面在内义上简单解释的那些话各自的大致含义。如：流便（流便是指信之真理，也就是重生的第一个阶段）寻见风茄；便拿来给他母亲利亚（利亚是指对外在真理的情感）；拉结（拉结是指对内在真理的情感）很想要它们，于是风茄就给了她；利亚因此与她的男人雅各（雅各是指属世人里面的真理之良善）同寝；还有，在下文，雅各与利亚生了儿子以萨迦和西布伦，以萨迦和西布伦就表示和代表与婚姻之爱，因而与天上婚姻有关的事物；然后又生了约瑟，约瑟表示和代表主的属灵国度，也就是此处所论述的婚姻本身。</p>

<p align="center"><b>Potts(1905-1910) 3952</b></p><p><b>3952.</b>
And he lay with her that night. That this signifies conjunction, is evident without explication. The reason why the foregoing matters have been unfolded in the internal sense merely as to the significations 
of the words, is that they are of such a nature that they cannot be comprehended unless they are set forth in one series. For the subject treated of is the conjunction of truth with good and of 
good with truth, which conjunction is the conjugial as understood in the spiritual sense; that is, the conjunction which makes the heavenly marriage with man and in the church. The arcana of this heavenly 
marriage are described in the above verses, and are there revealed as follows. As before shown the heavenly marriage is that of good with truth and of truth with good, yet is not between good and 
truth of one and the same degree, but between good and truth of a lower and of a higher degree, that is, not between the good of the external man and the truth of the same, but between the good of 
the external man and the truth of the internal; or what is the same, not between the good of the natural man and its truth, but between the good of the natural man and the truth of the spiritual man. 
This conjunction is that which makes the marriage. [2] It is the same in the internal or spiritual man; the heavenly marriage there is not between the good and the truth in that man; but between the 
good of the spiritual man and the truth of the celestial man; for the celestial man is relatively in a higher degree. Nor is there a heavenly marriage between the good and the truth in the celestial man; 
but between the good of the celestial man and the truth Divine which proceeds from the Lord. From this it is also evident that the Divine marriage itself of the Lord is not between the good Divine 
and the truth Divine in His Divine Human, but between the good of the Divine Human and the Divine Itself, that is, between the Son and the Father; for the good of the Lord's Divine Human is that which 
is called in the Word the "Son of God," and the Divine Itself is called the "Father."  [3] These are the arcana contained in the internal sense in what is said concerning the dudaim. Everyone can see 
that there must be some arcanum therein, for to relate that Reuben found dudaim in the field, and that Rachel longed for them, and in return for them promised that their man should lie with Leah; and 
that Leah went to meet Jacob when he came from the field in the evening, and said that she had hired him with the dudaim-these things would be too trivial to make any part of the history in the Word, 
unless there was something Divine hidden within them. But what Divine thing is meant no one can know unless he knows what is signified by the sons of Jacob and by the tribes named from them; and unless 
he also knows the series of the subject in the internal sense; and moreover unless he knows what the heavenly marriage is, for this is what is treated of, namely, that it is the conjunction of the 
good in the external man with the affection of truth in the internal man.  [4] But in order to the better understanding of this arcanum, I may illustrate it further. The truths of the external man 
are the memory-knowledges and doctrinal things that the man first learned from his parents, and also from his teachers, then from books, and finally by his own study. The good of the external man is the 
pleasure and delight that he perceives in these things. The memory-knowledges, which are truths, and the delights, which are good, are conjoined together; but they do not make in him the heavenly marriage, 
for with those who are in the love of self and of the world, and thence in evil and falsity, the memory-knowledges, and even the doctrinal things, are conjoined with delights; but it is with 
the delights of these loves, for with these even truths can be conjoined. And yet such persons are out of the heavenly marriage. But when the pleasure or the delight that is the good of the external or 
natural man is from spiritual love, that is, from love toward the neighbor, toward our country or the state, toward the church and the Lord's kingdom, and still more when it is from celestial love, 
which is love to the Lord; and when these flow in from the internal or spiritual man into the delight of the external or natural man and make it; then this conjunction with the memory-knowledges and doctrinal 
things of the external or natural man constitutes with him the heavenly marriage. This is not possible with the evil, but only with the good, that is, with those who have these things as their 
end. (But see how the case is with the influx of the internal or spiritual man into the external or natural man, n. 3286, 3288, 3314, 3321.) [5] As soon as these things have become known, it is possible 
to know what is signified by each of the things that have been explained above in regard merely to the internal sense of the words-as that Reuben (who is the truth of faith, which is the first of 
regeneration) found dudaim; that he brought them to his mother Leah (who is the affection of external truth); that Rachel (who is the affection of interior truth) longed for them, and that they were 
given her; that Leah therefore lay with her man Jacob (who is the good of truth in the natural man) also, in what follows, that there were born to Jacob by Leah the sons Issachar and Zebulun, by whom 
are signified and represented the things of conjugial love, and thus of the heavenly marriage; and then that Joseph was born, by whom is signified and represented the Lord's spiritual kingdom, which 
is the marriage itself that is treated of. </p>

<p align="center"><b>Elliott(1983-1999) 3952</b></p><p><b>3952.</b>
'And he lay with her that night' means the actual joining together. This too becomes clear without explanation. The reason why the explanation of the expressions immediately preceding this has for the 
most part been limited to giving simply the meanings which they have in the internal sense is that they are the kind of things which cannot be understood unless they are presented separately one after 
another. For the subject is the joining of truth to good and of good to truth, and this joining together of them is the conjugial relationship meant in the spiritual sense; that is, when with man or 
in the Church the two are so joined together the heavenly marriage is effected. The arcana of this heavenly marriage have been described in the verses above, where they are shown to be the following: 
As has been stated, the heavenly marriage is a marriage of good to truth and of truth to good. It is not however a marriage between good and truth which both belong to one and the same degree, but between 
good and truth which belong one to a lower degree, the other to a higher. That is, it is not a marriage between the good of the external man and the truth of the same, but between the good of the 
external man and the truth of the internal man; or what amounts to the same, it is not a marriage between the good of the natural man and the truth of the same, but between the good of the natural 
man and the truth of the spiritual man. It is when good and truth of different degrees are joined together that the marriage comes into effect. </p>
<p></p>
<p><b>[2]</b>
 The same applies in the internal or spiritual man. 
The heavenly marriage is not a marriage between the good and the truth present there but between the good of the spiritual man and the truth of the celestial man, for compared with the spiritual man 
the celestial man belongs to a higher degree. Nor again is the heavenly marriage between the good and the truth present there, but between the good of the celestial man and the Divine truth which proceeds 
from the Lord. From this it is in addition evident that the Divine marriage itself within the Lord is not a marriage between the Divine good and the Divine truth present in His Divine Human but 
between the Good of the Divine Human and the Divine itself, that is, between the Son and the Father, for the Good of the Lord's Divine Human is that which in the Word is called 'the Son of God' and the 
Divine itself that which is called 'the Father'. </p>
<p></p>
<p><b>[3]</b>
 These are the arcana contained in the internal sense present within the things said about the dudaim. Anyone may see that there is some arcanum 
hidden within them. For the following details - those about Reuben's finding dudaim in the field and Rachel's desiring them, and, so that she might acquire them, about her agreeing to their husband's 
lying with Leah, and about Leah's going out to meet Jacob when he came from the field in the evening and her saying that she had hired him for the dudaim - would not have been important enough for them 
to be mentioned in any historical description in the Word unless something Divine had lain hidden within them. Exactly what that something Divine is nobody can know unless he knows what is meant by 
the sons of Jacob and by the tribes named after them, and also unless he knows the flow of ideas belonging to the subject dealt with in the internal sense, and on top of this unless he knows what the 
heavenly marriage is. For that marriage is the subject; that is to say, the joining of the good of the external man to the affection for the truth of the internal man is the subject. But to enable this 
arcanum to be seen more clearly, let a further illustration be given. </p>
<p></p>
<p><b>[4]</b>
 The truths of the external man are the facts and the matters of doctrine which he acquires first through parents and also 
teachers, after that through books, and at length by his own endeavours. The good of the external man is the pleasure and delight which he finds in those facts and matters of doctrine. Facts which 
are essentially truths, and delights which are essentially good, are joined together, but these do not constitute the heavenly marriage with him, for even with people who are governed by self-love and 
love of the world and who are consequently under the influence of evil and falsity, facts, and indeed matters of doctrine, are joined to delights; but they are the delights that go with self-love and 
love of the world, to which truths are able to be joined. All the same, such people are outside the heavenly marriage. But the heavenly marriage exists in a person when pleasure or delight, which essentially 
is the good of the external or natural man, stems from spiritual love. That is, the heavenly marriage exists with him when that good stems from love towards the neighbour, towards his country 
or the general public, towards the Church, towards the Lord's kingdom; and it exists even more fully when it stems from celestial love, which is love to the Lord. For when that spiritual or celestial 
love passes from the internal or spiritual man into the delight of the external or natural man and fashions that delight, it is then joined to the facts and the matters of doctrine of the external or 
natural. But such a marriage cannot exist with the evil, only with the good, that is to say, with those who have those things as the end in view. But see what has been said already in <a href="3286.htm">3286</a>, <a href="3288.htm">3288</a>, <a href="3314.htm">3314</a>, <a href="3321.htm">3321</a>, about the influx of the internal or spiritual man into the external or natural man. </p>
<p></p>
<p><b>[5]</b>
 Once acquainted with these arcana one may now come to see the overall meaning of the individual expressions, 
the explanations of which in preceding paragraphs was limited simply to giving their individual meanings in the internal sense, those expressions and their meanings being these: 'Reuben', who 
means the truth of faith, which is the first stage of regeneration, 'found dudaim'; 'he brought them to Leah his mother' who means the affection for external truth; 'Rachel' who means the affection for 
interior truth 'desired them', and they were also 'given to her'; Leah therefore 'lay with Jacob her husband' who means the good of truth within the natural man. Likewise the expressions in what comes 
after this: Sons were born to Jacob by Leah, 'Issachar and Zebulun', by whom things to do with conjugial love and so with the heavenly marriage are meant and represented; and after this, 'Joseph' 
was born, by whom the Lord's spiritual kingdom - the marriage itself, which is the subject here - is meant and represented. </p>

`Et cubuit cum illa in nocte illa': quod significet conjunctionem, constare etiam potest absque explicatione.  Quod praecedentia ad maximam partem solum quoad vocum significationes in sensu interno 
explicata sint, in causa est quia talia sunt ut non comprehendi possint nisi in una serie exponantur; agitur enim de conjunctione veri cum bono et boni cum vero, quae conjunctio est conjugiale in 
spirituali sensu intellectum, hoc est, quae facit apud hominem et in Ecclesia conjugium caeleste; arcana conjugii hujus nempe caelestis in illis descripta sunt ac ibi revelata, quae sunt haec: conjugium 
caeleste est, ut dictum, boni cum vero et veri cum bono, sed non inter bonum et verum unius ejusdemque gradus, sed inter bonum et verum inferioris gradus et superioris, hoc est, non inter bonum 
externi hominis et verum ejusdem, sed inter bonum externi hominis et verum interni, seu quod idem, non inter bonum naturalis hominis et ejus verum, sed inter bonum naturalis hominis et verum spiritualis 
{1}; [2] haec conjunctio est quae facit conjugium; similiter se habet in interno seu spirituali homine; ibi inter bonum et verum non est conjugium caeleste, sed inter bonum spiritualis hominis 
et verum caelestis hominis, caelestis enim homo est in superiore gradu respective; nec conjugium caeleste est inter bonum et verum ibi, sed inter bonum caelestis hominis et Verum Divinum quod 
procedit a Domino; inde quoque patet quod ipsum conjugium Divinum Domini non sit inter Bonum Divinum et Verum Divinum in {2}Divino Humano Ipsius, sed inter Bonum {3}Divini Humani et Ipsum Divinum, 
hoc est, inter Filium et Patrem, nam Bonum {3}Divini Humani Domini est quod in Verbo vocatur `Filius {4}Dei,' et Ipsum Divinum `Pater.'  [3] Haec arcana sunt quae continentur in sensu interno {5}in 
illis quae dicuntur de dudaim: quisque videre potest quod inibi aliquod arcanum sit; nam memorare quod Reuben in agro invenerit dudaim, et Rachel desideraverit illos, et pro quod accepit illos, 
spoponderit quod vir eorum cubaret cum illa, et quod Leah obviam iverit Jacobo cum ex agro venit in vespera, et dixerit quod conduxerit illum pro dudaim, haec leviora forent quam ut aliquod historicum 
Verbi facerent nisi Divinum quoddam inibi reconditum esset; sed quodnam Divinum, nemo scire potest nisi sciat quid per filios Jacobi, et {6}per tribus ab illis nominatas significatur; tum nisi 
sciat seriem rei in sensu interno; et insuper nisi sciat {7}quid conjugium caeleste est, nam de hoc agitur, quod nempe sit conjunctio boni externi hominis cum affectione veri interni hominis; sed hoc 
arcanum ut manifestius sciatur, licet adhuc illustrare.'  [4] Externi hominis vera sunt scientifica et doctrinalia quae hausit {8}primum {9}per parentes, tum per magistros, {10}dein per libros, 
et tandem proprio studio; </p>
<p>bonum externi hominis est volupe et jucundum quod percipit in illis; scientifica quae sunt vera, et jucunda quae sunt bonum, conjunguntur, sed non faciunt apud illum conjugium 
caeleste, nam apud illos qui in amore sui et mundi sunt et inde in malo et falso, etiam scientifica, immo doctrinalia, conjuncta jucundis sunt, sed sunt jucunda amorum illorum, cum quibus {11}etiam 
vera conjungi possunt; sed usque sunt tales extra conjugium caeleste: at cum volupe aut jucundum, quod est bonum externi seu naturalis hominis, ex amore spirituali est, hoc est, ex amore erga 
proximum, erga patriam seu publicum, erga Ecclesiam, erga regnum Domini, et magis, ex amore caelesti qui est in Dominum, et haec ab interno seu spirituali homine influunt in jucundum externi seu naturalis hominis, 
et id faciunt, tunc conjunctio illa cum scientificis et doctrinalibus externi seu naturalis hominis, facit apud eum conjugium caeleste; hoc non dari potest apud malos, sed apud bonos, qui 
nempe pro fine habent illa; sed quomodo se habet cum influxu interni seu spiritualis hominis in externam seu naturalem, videantur quae prius n. 3286, 3288, 3314, 3321 de illis dicta sunt; </p>
<p>haec 
cum prius cognita sunt, tunc sciri potest, quid per singula illa quae {12}supra solum quoad sensum internum vocum explicata sunt, significatur, ut quod `Reuben,' qui est verum fidei quod primum 
regenerationis est, `dudaim invenerit,' quod `ad matrem suam Leam,' quae est affectio veri externi, `adduxerit,' quod `Rachel,' quae est affectio veri interioris, `illos desideraverit,' et quod etiam 
`ei dati sint,' quod (t)Leah ideo `cubuerit cum viro suo, Jacobo,' qui est bonum veri in naturali homine; tum in consequentibus quod {13}nati sint Jacobo filii ex Leah, `Jisaschar et Zebulun,'
