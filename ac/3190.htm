<h3 align="center" class="ired">属天的奥秘 第3190节</h3>
<h4 align="center"></h4><p><strong>3190.</strong>“骑上骆驼”表心智的理解力部分被提升超越属世的记忆知识。这从“骑上”和“骆驼”的含义清楚可知：“骑上”是指理解力部分被提升（参看<a href="2761.htm">2761</a>-<a href="2762.htm">2762</a>节）；“骆驼”是指属世人中一般的记忆知识（参看<a href="3048.htm">3048</a>，<a href="3071.htm">3071</a>节），因而是指属世的记忆知识。其中的情形是这样：当真理从属世人中被提升出来进入理性人时，它就从尘世之光的领域被提出来，进入天堂之光的领域，因而可以说从夜晚的模糊进入白昼的清晰。因为属于充满一切属世物体的尘世之光的事物相对来说如同在夜晚；而属于充满一切属灵物体的天堂之光的事物相对来说则如同在白昼。因此，当真理从属世人被提升向理性人时，此人同时被提升进入聪明和智慧中。人所具有的一切聪明和智慧皆出自这个源头。这些就是理解力部分被提升超越属世的记忆知识所表示的。</p>

<p align="center"><b>Potts(1905-1910) 3190</b></p><p><b>3190.</b>
And they rode upon the camels. That this signifies the intellectual part elevated above natural memory-knowledges, is evident from the signification of "riding," as being to be elevated as to the intellectual 
part (see n. 2761-2762) and from the signification of "camels," as being general memory-knowledges in the natural man (see n. 3048, 3071), thus natural memory-knowledges. The case herein is 
this: when truth is elevated out of the natural into the rational, it is taken out of the sphere of worldly light into the sphere of heavenly light, thus as it were from the obscurity of night into the 
clearness of day; for the things which are of the light of the world, in which are all natural things, are relatively as in night, but the things which are of the light of heaven, in which are spiritual 
things, are relatively as in day; and therefore when truth is elevated out of the natural toward the rational, the man is at the same time elevated into intelligence and into wisdom; moreover all 
intelligence and wisdom with man are from this source. This is what is signified by the intellectual part being elevated above natural memory-knowledges. </p>

<p align="center"><b>Elliott(1983-1999) 3190</b></p><p><b>3190.</b>
'And they rode on the camels' means the understanding part of the mind, raised up above natural facts. This is clear from the meaning of 'riding' as the understanding when raised up, dealt with in <a href="2761.htm">2761</a>, <a href="2762.htm">2762</a>, and from the meaning of 'camels' as general facts in the natural man, dealt with in <a href="3048.htm">3048</a>, <a href="3071.htm">3071</a>, and so natural facts. The implications of this are that when truth from the natural is raised 
up into the rational it is borne out of the sphere of worldly light into that of heavenly light - so to speak from the obscurity of night into the brightness of day. For the things that belong to the 
light of the world, in which all natural objects exist, dwell so to speak in night, compared with things belonging to the light of heaven; but things that belong to the light of heaven, in which all spiritual 
objects exist, dwell so to speak in daylight, compared with things belonging to the light of the world. Consequently when truth from the natural is raised up towards the rational, the person 
is raised up at the same time into intelligence and wisdom. All the intelligence and wisdom present with man comes from this source. These are the things meant by the understanding part, raised up above 
natural facts. </p>

`Et equitabant super camelis': quod significet intellectuale elevatum super scientifica naturalia, constat a significatione `equitare' quod sit elevari quoad intellectuale, de qua n. 2761, 2762; et 
a significatione `camelorum' quod sint scientifica communia in naturali homine, de qua n. 3048, 3071, ita scientifica naturalia. Res ita se habet: cum verum e naturali {1}elevatur in rationale, tunc {2}aufertur 
e sphaera lucis mundanae in sphaeram lucis caelestis, ita quasi ab obscuro noctis in clarum diei; quae enim sunt lucis mundi, in qua sunt omnia naturalia, sunt respective sicut in nocte, at 
quae sunt lucis caeli, in qua sunt spiritualia, sunt respective sicut in die; quare cum verum e naturali elevatur versus rationale, homo elevatur simul in intelligentiam ac in sapientiam; omnis etiam 
intelligentia et sapientia apud hominem est inde: {3}tale significatur per quod intellectuale elevatum sit super scientifica naturalia. @1 i homine$  @2 after caelestis$  @3 A has this clause but 
deletes it$  </p>
