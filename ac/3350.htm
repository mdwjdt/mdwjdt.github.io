<h3 align="center" class="ired">属天的奥秘 第3350节</h3>
<h4 align="center"></h4><p><strong>3350.</strong>为了更清楚地说明代表的性质，我再举一个例子。我曾听见许多内层天堂的天堂一起或协力形成一个代表。我周围的灵人若不通过某种内在情感的流注，就无法理解它。它是一个合唱团，在这个合唱团里，许多天使一起思想同样的事，说同样的话。他们通过代表在主的头上形成一顶镶有钻石的金王冠。同时，这一切通过一系列快速的代表，就是诸如上面所提到的思维和言谈的那类代表（<a href="3342.htm">3342</a>-<a href="3344.htm">3344</a>节）实现。说来奇妙，虽然天使有很多，但他们全都作为一体去思想和说话，因而全都表现为一体。这是因为，没有人想凭自己做什么，更不会指挥其他人，从而领导合唱团。凡这样做的人会立刻自动与合唱团分离。不过，众人都允许自己被彼此引领，因而他们全都由主引领，无论个体还是集体。凡进入来世的善人都被引入这种和谐的关系中。<br />后来，我又听到许多合唱团，它们以代表展现了各种事物；尽管合唱团有很多，并且每个合唱团都有许多成员，他们全都行如一体；因为蕴含天堂优美之物的一个整体是由那里各种代表所取的形式产生的。这就是由无数人所组成的整个天堂，它能通过在那里进行统治的相爱而行如一体，因为他们由此允许自己被主引领。神奇的是，他们的数目，也就是构成天堂的众多人的数目越大，每一个事物也就变得越独特和完美；就内层天堂的天使而言，一切更是如此，因为一切完美朝着内层增长。</p>

In order to show more plainly the nature of representatives, I may adduce one additional instance. I heard a host of angels of the interior heaven who together or in consort were forming a representative. 
The spirits about me could not perceive it, except from a certain influx of interior affection. It was a choir, in which many angels together thought the same thing, and spoke the same thing. By 
representations they formed a golden crown gemmed with diamonds around the Lord's head; which was effected all at once by means of a rapid series of representations, such as are those of thought and 
speech spoken of above (n. 3342-3344); and wonderful to say, although there were a host they nevertheless all thought and spoke as a one, thus they all represented as a one; and this because no one was 
desirous to do anything from himself, still less to preside over the rest and lead the choir; for whoever does this is of himself instantly dissociated. But they suffered themselves to be led mutually 
by each other, thus all individually and collectively by the Lord. All the good who come into the other life are brought into such harmonious agreements. [2] Afterwards there were heard many choirs, 
which exhibited various things representatively, and although there were many choirs, and many in each choir, still they acted as a one; for from the form of various things there resulted a one, in 
which was heavenly beauty. Thus the universal heaven, which consists of myriads of myriads, can act as a one by being in mutual love; for thereby they suffer themselves to be led by the Lord; and wonderful 
to say the greater their numbers, that is, the greater the number of the myriads who constitute heaven, so much the more distinctly and perfectly are things done in general and in particular; and 
the more also in proportion as the angels are of a more interior heaven; for all perfection increases toward the interiors. </p>

To make the nature of representatives quite plain let one further example be introduced. I once heard very many angels of the interior heaven who were working together or in unison to form a representative. 
The spirits around me were unable to perceive it except from a certain influx of interior affection. It was a choir in which those very many angels thought the same thing together, and uttered 
the same thing. By means of representations they were forming a golden crown set with diamonds around the Lord's head. This was effected at the same time by means of a rapid sequence of representations 
like those of thought and speech mentioned above in <a href="3342.htm">3342</a>-<a href="3344.htm">3344</a>. And the wonder of it was, although there were very many angels they all nevertheless thought and spoke as one, and in so doing represented 
as one. They did so because nobody wished to do anything by himself, let alone direct the rest and so lead the choir. Anyone who does this is of himself instantly severed from the choir. But all 
did allow themselves to be led by one another, and so they were all, individually and collectively, led by the Lord. Into such harmonious relationships all good persons are introduced who enter the next 
life. </p>
<p></p>
<p><b>[2]</b>
 After that I heard many more groups who presented various things within representatives; and although the choirs were many, and each choir had many members, they all nevertheless acted 
as one, for from the form taken by the various representations there resulted a single whole, containing that which was superbly heavenly. Such is the whole of heaven able to be - which consists of myriads 
upon myriads acting as one - through the mutual love reigning there, for thus they allow themselves to be led by the Lord. And the wonder of it is, the more there are, that is, the more myriads 
there are constituting heaven, the more distinct and separate, and the more perfect, does every single one become; all the more so in the case of the angels of the interior heaven, since all perfection 
increases towards the interior parts. </p>

Ut pateat qualia sunt repraesentativa, licet adhuc unum exemplum afferre; audivi angelos interioris caeli perplures qui simul seu in consortio formabant repraesentativum; spiritus circum me non potuerunt 
percipere illud nisi ex quodam interioris affectionis influxu; chorus erat, in quo plures illi simul idem cogitabant, ac idem locuti sunt; per repraesentationes formabant coronam auream cum adamantibus 
circum caput Domini; quod fiebat simul per repraesentationum series citas, quales sunt cogitationis et loquelae, de quibus supra n. 3342-3344 dictum: et quod mirabile, tametsi perplures erant, 
usque tamen omnes sicut unus cogitabant et loquebantur, ita sicut unus repraesentabant, et hoc quia nemo ex se aliquid agere volebat, minus reliquis praeesse, ac ducere chorum; qui hoc facit, momento 
ex se dissociatur; sed se a se mutuo duci passi sunt, ita omnes in singulari et in communi a Domino: in tales convenientias perducuntur omnes boni qui in alteram vitam veniunt. [2] {1}Deinde auditi sunt 
chori perplures, qui {2}varia repraesentative exhibuerunt, et tametsi plures chori essent et plures in unoquovis choro, usque sicut unus agebant, ex forma enim variorum resultabat unum, in quo pulchrum 
caeleste. Ita potest universum caelum, quod ex myriadum myriadibus consistit, qui unum agunt, per quod in amore mutuo sunt, nam sic se duci patiuntur a Domino, et quod mirabile, quo plures sunt, 
hoc est, quo plures myriades qui caelum constituunt, eo omnia et singula distinctius et perfectius fiunt; et quoque quo interioris caeli angeli sunt, nam omnis perfectio crescit versus interiora. @1
