<h3 align="center" class="ired">属天的奥秘 第3762节</h3>
<h4 align="center"></h4><p><strong>3762.</strong>“到了东方之子的地”表提升到爱之真理。这从“东方之子的地”的含义清楚可知。显然，亚兰或叙利亚被称为“东方之子的地”，因为这就是雅各所去之地（参看<a href="3249.htm">3249</a>节）。“叙利亚”一般是指对良善的认知，如前所示（<a href="1232.htm">1232</a>，<a href="1234.htm">1234</a>节）；而“亚兰-纳哈拉姆（Aram Naharaim即两河的叙利亚）”特指对真理的认知（<a href="3051.htm">3051</a>，<a href="3664.htm">3664</a>节）。然而，在这种情况下，为了表示整个这一章所论述的主题，即朝向爱之真理的提升，经上没有说他到“亚兰”或“叙利亚”，而是说“到了东方之子的地”。爱之真理用来描述那些在别处被称作属天真理的真理，因为它们是涉及对邻之仁和对主之爱的认知。就论述主的至高意义而言，它们就是神性之爱的真理。<br />人在能够重生之前，必须先学习这些涉及对邻之仁和对主之爱的真理；并且这些真理必须得到承认和相信。它们越得到承认、相信，并被赋予生命，人就越重生，同时它们也越被植入在人的属世层中，在那里如在自己的土壤中。它们首先通过教导被植入在属世层中，这些教导来自父母和老师，然后来自主的圣言，之后来自人自己对它们的深入思考。不过，通过这些方法，它们只是被储存在属世人的记忆中，被列入那里的认知当中，仍旧得不到承认、相信和接受，除非照它们去生活。因为在这种情况下，此人便进入对它们的情感中，并且他越通过生活进入对它们的情感，这些真理就越被植入在他的属世层中，如在自己的土壤中。诚然，没有被如此植入的真理也与此人同在，但只作为某种知识或历史而存在于他的记忆中。这种知识或历史仅仅能使他谈论这类事，利用它们赚取名声，从而获得财富和地位。在这种情况下，这些真理还没有被植入在他里面。<br />至于“东方之子”表示爱之真理，因而表示通向良善的真理认知，这一点从“子”和“东方”的含义可以看出来：“子”是指真理（参看<a href="489.htm">489</a>，<a href="491.htm">491</a>，<a href="533.htm">533</a>，<a href="1147.htm">1147</a>，<a href="2623.htm">2623</a>节）；“东方”是指爱（<a href="101.htm">101</a>，<a href="1250.htm">1250</a>，<a href="3249.htm">3249</a>节）。他们的地就是它们存在于其中的土壤。因为“东方之子”是指那些拥有对真理与良善的认知，因而拥有爱之真理的人。这一点还可从圣言中的其它经文看出来，如列王纪：<br />所罗门的智慧超过一切东方之子的智慧和埃及人的一切智慧。（列王记上<a href="http://39-27.cn/王上4.30.htm">4:30</a>）<br />此处“东方之子的智慧”表示对真理与良善的内在认知，因而表示那些拥有它们的人。而“埃及人的智慧”表示对这些事物的记忆知识，它们处于较低层级。“埃及人”表示总的记忆知识（参看<a href="1164.htm">1164</a>，<a href="1165.htm">1165</a>，<a href="1462.htm">1462</a>节）。<br />耶利米书：<br />耶和华如此说，起来，上去攻击基达，毁灭东方之子。他们的帐棚和羊群都要夺去，他们的幔子和一切器皿，并骆驼也要掠去。（耶利米书<a href="http://39-27.cn/耶49.28.htm">49:28</a>-<a href="http://39-27.cn/耶49.29.htm">29</a>）<br />此处“东方之子”表示那些拥有对良善与真理的认知之人。这一点从以下事实明显可知：“他们的帐棚和羊群都要夺去，他们的幔子和一切器皿，并骆驼也要掠去”。因为“帐棚”表示良善的神圣事物（<a href="414.htm">414</a>，<a href="1102.htm">1102</a>，<a href="2145.htm">2145</a>，<a href="2152.htm">2152</a>，<a href="3312.htm">3312</a>节）；“羊群”表仁之良善（<a href="343.htm">343</a>，<a href="2566.htm">2566</a>节）；“幔子”表神圣真理（<a href="2576.htm">2576</a>，<a href="3478.htm">3478</a>节）；“器皿”表信之真理和记忆知识（<a href="3068.htm">3068</a>，<a href="3079.htm">3079</a>节）；“骆驼”是指总的记忆知识（<a href="3048.htm">3048</a>，<a href="3071.htm">3071</a>，<a href="3143.htm">3143</a>，<a href="3145.htm">3145</a>节）。因此，“东方之子”表示那些拥有这些事物，即拥有对良善与真理的认知之人。<br />耶稣出生时到祂那里的东方智者就属于那些被称作东方之子的人。这一点从以下事实明显可知，他们知道主要降生，并且通过东方显现给他们的那颗星知晓祂的到来。这些事在马太福音中被描述如下：<br />当耶稣生在犹太的伯利恒时，看哪，有几个博士从东方来到耶路撒冷，说，那生下来作犹太人之王的在哪里？我们在东方看见祂的星，特来拜祂。（马太福音<a href="http://39-27.cn/太2.1.htm">2:1</a>-<a href="http://39-27.cn/太2.2.htm">2</a>）<br />自古以来，来自叙利亚的东方之子当中就有这样的预言。这一事实从巴兰关于主到来的预言清楚可知，摩西五经：<br />我看见祂，却不在现时； 我望见祂，却不在近处。必有一星从雅各而出，必有一杖从以色列兴起。（民数记<a href="http://39-27.cn/民24.17.htm">24:17</a>）<br />巴兰来自东方之子的地，即来自叙利亚。这一事实从这些话明显看出来：<br />巴兰便题起诗歌说，巴勒领我出叙利亚；摩押王领我出东山。（民数记<a href="http://39-27.cn/民23.7.htm">23:7</a>）<br />耶稣出生时到祂那里的那三个智者被称为博士，那时，这个词是用来称谓智者的。这一点从许多经文明显看出来，如创世记（<a href="http://39-27.cn/创41.8.htm">41:8</a>），出埃及记（<a href="http://39-27.cn/出7.11.htm">7:11</a>），但以理书（<a href="http://39-27.cn/但2.27.htm">2:27</a>；<a href="http://39-27.cn/但4.6.htm">4:6</a>，<a href="http://39-27.cn/但4.7.htm">7</a>），以及先知书的各处。<br />“东方之子”在反面意义上表示对邪恶与虚假的认知，因而表示那些拥有它们的人。这一点明显可见于以赛亚书：<br />以法莲的嫉妒就必消散，犹大的仇敌必被剪除；他们要向西飞，扑在非利士人的肩头上；一同掳掠东方之子。（以赛亚书<a href="http://39-27.cn/赛11.13.htm">11:13</a>-<a href="http://39-27.cn/赛11.14.htm">14</a>）<br />在以西结书，当说预言攻击亚扪人时：<br />看哪，我要把你交给东方之子为业，他们必在你中间安营居住。（以西结书<a href="http://39-27.cn/结25.4.htm">25:4</a>，<a href="http://39-27.cn/结25.10.htm">10</a>）<br />士师记：<br />以色列人每逢撒种之后，米甸人、亚玛力人和东方之子都上来；他们都上来攻打他们。（士师记<a href="http://39-27.cn/士6.3.htm">6:3</a>）<br />“米甸人”表示那些处于虚假的人，因为他们没有生活的良善（<a href="3242.htm">3242</a>节）；“亚玛力人”表示那些处于用来攻击真理的虚假之人（<a href="1679.htm">1679</a>节）；“东方之子”表示那些具有支持虚假的认知之人。</p>

And went to the land of the sons of the east. That this signifies to the truths of love (that is, elevation thereto) is evident from the signification of the "land of the sons of the east." That Aram, 
or Syria, was called the "land of the sons of the east," is evident, because it was thither that Jacob betook himself (see n. 3249). That by "Syria" in general are signified the knowledges of good, 
was shown above (n. 1232, 1234); but specifically, by "Aram-naharaim" (that is, "Syria of the rivers") are signified the knowledges of truth (n. 3051, 3664). In this case however it is not said that he 
went "to Aram," or "Syria," but "to the land of the sons of the east," in order to signify what is treated of in this chapter throughout, namely, an ascent to the truths of love. Those truths are called 
the truths of love which have been elsewhere termed celestial truths, for they are knowledges that relate to charity toward the neighbor and love to the Lord; in the supreme sense, in which the Lord 
is treated of, they are the truths of Divine love.  [2] These truths, that relate to charity toward the neighbor and to love to the Lord, must be learned before it is possible for a man to be regenerated; 
and must also be acknowledged and believed; and insofar as they are acknowledged, believed, and ingrafted in the life, so far the man is regenerated, and insofar they are at the same time implanted 
in the man's natural, in which they are as in their own ground. They are first implanted therein through instruction by parents and teachers; next from the Word of the Lord; and afterwards through 
the man's own reflection about them; but by these means they are merely stored up in the memory of the natural man, being classed among the knowledges therein, but still not acknowledged, believed, 
and ingrafted, unless the life is in accordance with them; for in this case the man comes into affection, and insofar as he comes into affection from life, so far these truths are implanted in his 
natural as in their ground. The truths which are not thus implanted are indeed with the man, but are merely in his memory as a matter of mere knowledge or history, which serves no other purpose than to 
be talked about and made the means of getting a reputation which is to serve for the acquisition of riches and honors. But in this case these truths are not implanted. [3] That by the "land of the 
sons of the east" are signified the truths of love, thus the knowledges of truth which tend to good, may be seen from the signification of "sons," as being truths (see n. 489, 491, 533, 1147, 2623); and 
from the signification of the "east," as being love (n. 101, 1250, 3249). Their "land" is the ground in which they are. That the "sons of the east" are those who are in the knowledges of truth and 
good, and consequently in the truths of love, may be seen also from other passages in the Word. As in the first book of Kings: </p>
<p>     The wisdom of Solomon was multiplied more than the wisdom of all the 
sons of the east, and than all the wisdom of the Egyptians (1 Kings:4:30); </p>
<p>where by the "wisdom of the sons of the east" are signified the interior knowledges of truth and good, thus those who are 
in them;" but by the "wisdom of the Egyptians" is signified the memory-knowledge of the same, which is in a lower degree. (That by the "Egyptians" are signified memory-knowledges in general, may be seen 
n. 1164, 1165, 1462.) [4] In Jeremiah: </p>
<p>     Thus saith Jehovah, Arise ye, go up against Kedar, lay waste the sons of the east. Their tents and their flocks they shall take; they shall take their 
curtains, and all their vessels, and their camels (Jer. 49:28-29). That by the "sons of the east" are here meant those who are in the knowledges of good and truth, is evident from the fact that they 
were to take their tents and flocks, also their curtains and all their vessels, and likewise their camels; for by "tents" are signified the holy things of good (n. 414, 1102, 2145, 2152, 3312); by "flocks," 
the goods of charity (n. 343, 2566); by "curtains," holy truths (n. 2576, 3478); by "vessels," truths of faith and memory-knowledges (n. 3068, 3079); by "camels," memory-knowledges in general (n. 
3048, 3071, 3143, 3145). Thus by the "sons of the east" are signified those who are in these things, that is, who are in the knowledges of good and truth. [5] That the wise men from the east who came 
to Jesus at His birth were of those who were called the "sons of the east," is evident from the fact that they were in the knowledge that the Lord was to be born, and that they knew of His advent 
by a star which appeared to them in the east, concerning which things we read in Matthew: </p>
<p>     When Jesus was born in Bethlehem of Judea, behold there came wise men from the east to Jerusalem, saying, 
Where is He that is born King of the Jews? for we have seen His star in the east, and are come to worship Him (Matt. 2:1-2). That from ancient times such a prophetic knowledge had existed among the 
sons of the east, who were of Syria, is evident from Balaam's prophecy concerning the Lord's advent, in Moses: </p>
<p>     I see Him, but not now; I behold Him, but not nigh there shall arise a star out of 
Jacob, and a scepter shall rise up out of Israel (Num. 24:17). That Balaam was from the land of the sons of the east, that is, from Syria, is evident from these words: </p>
<p>     Balaam uttered his enunciation 
and said, Balak hath brought me from Syria, out of the mountains of the east (Num. 23:7). Those wise men who came to Jesus at His birth are called magi,* but wise men were so called at that time, 
as is evident from many passages; such as Gen. 41:8; Exod. 7:11; Dan. 2:27; 4:6, 7; 1 Kings 4:30; and from the Prophets throughout. [6] That in the opposite sense the "sons of the east" signify the 
knowledges of evil and falsity, thus those who are in them, is evident in Isaiah: </p>
<p>     The envy of Ephraim shall depart, and the enemies of Judah shall be cut off; they shall fly on the shoulder of 
the Philistines toward the sea; and together shall they spoil the sons of the east (Isa. 11:13-14). In Ezekiel: </p>
<p>     Against the sons of Ammon. Behold I have delivered thee to the sons of the east 
for a possession, and they shall set their ordinances in thee (Ezek. 25:3-4). And in the book of Judges: </p>
<p>     When Israel sowed, Midian came up, and Amalek, and the sons of the east; they came up against 
him (Judg. 6:3). "Midian" denotes those who are in falsity because not in the good of life (n. 3242); "Amalek," those who are in falsities with which they assault truths (n. 1679); the "sons of 
the east," those who are in the knowledges of falsity. * Translated "magicians" in the passages cited. </p>

<p align="center"><b>Elliott(1983-1999) 3762</b></p><p><b>3762.</b>
'And went to the land of the sons of the east' means a raising up towards truths that relate to love. This is clear from the meaning of 'the land of the sons of the east'. For Aram or Syria was called 
'the land of the sons of the east', as is evident from the fact that it was the land to which Jacob went, see also <a href="3249.htm">3249</a>. In general, 'Syria' means cognitions of good, as shown in <a href="1232.htm">1232</a>, <a href="1234.htm">1234</a>, but specifically 
'Aram Naharaim' or Syria of the [Two] Rivers means cognitions of truth, in <a href="3051.htm">3051</a>, <a href="3664.htm">3664</a>. Here however it is not said that he went to Aram or Syria but 'to the land of the sons of the east', so 
as to mean that which is the subject in the whole of this chapter, namely an ascent towards truths that relate to love. The expression 'truths that relate to love' is used to describe those truths which 
in other places have been called celestial truths, for they are cognitions concerning charity towards the neighbour and concerning love to the Lord. In the highest sense, where the Lord is the subject, 
they are truths that relate to Divine love. </p>
<p></p>
<p><b>[2]</b>
 These truths, that is to say, those concerning charity towards the neighbour and concerning love to the Lord, must first be learned before a person 
can be regenerated, and must also be acknowledged and believed. And insofar as those truths are acknowledged and believed, and are endowed with life, that person is also regenerated and those truths 
are implanted in his natural, where they exist as in their own soil. They are first implanted there through the instruction received from parents and teachers, then from the Word of the Lord, and 
after that from personal reflection on them. But all of this does no more than to deposit those truths in the person's natural memory and so to place them among the cognitions there. They are still not 
acknowledged, believed, and received unless life is led in accordance with them, in which case the person enters into an affection for them; and insofar as he enters into an affection for them because 
his life accords with them, those truths are implanted in his natural as their own soil. Things that are not so implanted do indeed remain with that person, but only in his memory as some item of knowledge 
or historical fact which does no more than enable him to talk about such things, to further his reputation by means of them, and in so doing to grow in wealth and position. When this is the case 
truths have not been implanted within him. </p>
<p></p>
<p><b>[3]</b>
 As regards the meaning of 'the land of the sons of the east' as truths relating to love, and so as cognitions of truth leading the way to good, this 
may be seen from the meaning of 'sons' as truths, dealt with in <a href="489.htm">489</a>, <a href="491.htm">491</a>, <a href="533.htm">533</a>, <a href="1147.htm">1147</a>, <a href="2623.htm">2623</a>, and from the meaning of 'the east' as love, dealt with in <a href="101.htm">101</a>, <a href="1250.htm">1250</a>, <a href="3249.htm">3249</a>. Their land is the soil in which 
they exist. For 'the sons of the east' are those who possess cognitions concerning truth and good and therefore the truths that relate to love. This may be seen further from other places in the Word, 
as in the first Book of Kings, </p>
<p>The wisdom of Solomon surpassed the wisdom of all the sons of the east and all the wisdom of the Egyptians. <a href="1.htm">1</a> Kings 4:30. </p>
<p>Here 'the wisdom of the sons of the east' 
means interior cognitions concerning truth and good, and so means people who possess them. 'The wisdom of the Egyptians' however means knowledge of the same things as they exist in a lower degree -'the 
Egyptians' meaning factual knowledge in general, see <a href="1164.htm">1164</a>, <a href="1165.htm">1165</a>, <a href="1462.htm">1462</a>. </p>
<p></p>
<p><b>[4]</b>
 In Jeremiah, </p>
<p>Thus said Jehovah, Arise, go up against Kedar; lay waste the sons of the east. They will take their tents 
and flocks, their curtains and all their vessels, and will take their camels. Jer. 49:28, <a href="29.htm">29</a>. </p>
<p>Here 'the sons of the east' is used to mean those who possess cognitions concerning good and truth. 
This is clear from the fact that 'they will take their tents and flocks, also their curtains and all their vessels, as well as their camels'. For 'tents' means holy forms of good, <a href="414.htm">414</a>, <a href="1102.htm">1102</a>, <a href="2145.htm">2145</a>, <a href="2152.htm">2152</a>, <a href="3312.htm">3312</a>; 'flocks' the goods that flow from charity, <a href="343.htm">343</a>, <a href="2566.htm">2566</a>; 'curtains' holy truths, <a href="2576.htm">2576</a>, <a href="3478.htm">3478</a>; 'vessels' the truths of faith, and facts, <a href="3068.htm">3068</a>, <a href="3079.htm">3079</a>; 'camels' factual knowledge in general, <a href="3048.htm">3048</a>, <a href="3071.htm">3071</a>, 
<a href="3143.htm">3143</a>, <a href="3145.htm">3145</a>. Thus 'the sons of the east' means those who possess these, that is, cognitions concerning what is good and what is true.  </p>
<p></p>
<p><b>[5]</b>
 The wise men from the east who came to Jesus when He was 
born belonged to those people called the sons of the east. This becomes clear from the fact of their awareness that the Lord was to be born, and that they knew of His Coming from the star which appeared 
to them in the east. These matters are described in Matthew as follows, </p>
<p>When Jesus was born in Bethlehem of Judea, behold wise men from the east came into Jerusalem, saying, Where is He born 
King of the Jews? for we have seen His star in the east and have come to worship Him. Matt. 2:1, <a href="2.htm">2</a>. </p>
<p>The fact that such a prophecy existed from of old among the sons of the east, who were from Syria, 
is clear from Balaam's prophecy concerning the Lord's Coming, in Moses, </p>
<p>I see Him, but not now; I behold Him, but not near. A star will arise out of Jacob and a sceptre will rise up out of Israel. 
Num. 24:17. </p>
<p>The fact that Balaam was from the land of the sons of the east, that is, from Syria, is evident from the following in Moses, </p>
<p>Balaam uttered his declaration and said, From Syria has 
Balak, the king of Moab, brought me, from the mountains of the east. Num. 23:7. </p>
<p>The wise men who came to Jesus when He was born are called the magi, but this expression was used for wise men at that 
time, as is clear from many places, such as Gen. 41:8; Exod. 7:11; Dan. 2:27; 4:6, <a href="7.htm">7</a>; <a href="1.htm">1</a> Kings 4:30; and in various places in the Prophets. </p>
<p></p>
<p><b>[6]</b>
 'The sons of the east' in the contrary sense means 
cognitions concerning evil and falsity, and so means those who possess these. This is clear in Isaiah, </p>
<p>The envy of Ephraim will depart, and the enemies of Judah will be cut off. They will fly down 
onto the shoulder of the Philistines towards the sea, and together they will plunder the sons of the east. Isa. 11:13, <a href="14.htm">14</a>. </p>
<p>In Ezekiel, when prophesying against the sons of Ammon, </p>
<p>Behold, I have 
handed you over to the sons of the east as an inheritance, and they will station their ranks among you. Ezek. 25:4, <a href="10.htm">10</a>. </p>
<p>In the Book of Judges, </p>
<p>When Israel put in seed, Midian came up and Amalek, 
and the sons of the east; and they came up upon them. Judg. 6:3. </p>
<p>'Midian' stands for those under the influence of falsity because the good of life does not exist with them, <a href="3242.htm">3242</a>; 'Amalek' for those 
under the influence of falsities with which they assail truths, <a href="1679.htm">1679</a>; 'the sons of the east' for those who possess cognitions that support what is false. </p>

veri quae tendunt ad bonum, {7}constare potest a significatione `filiorum' quod sint vera, de qua n. 489, 491, 533, 1147, 2623; et ex significatione `orientis' quod sit amor, de qua n. 101, 1250, 
3249; terra illorum est humus in qua sunt{8}; quod `filii orientis' sint illi qui in cognitionibus veri et boni, proinde in veris amoris, constare (t)etiam potest alibi ex Verbo, ut in Libro Primo 
Regum,      Multiplicata est sapientia Salomonis prae sapientia omnium      filiorum orientis, et prae omni sapientia Aegyptiorum, v 10      [A.V. iv, 30]; </p>
<p>ubi per `sapientiam filiorum orientis' 
significantur cognitiones interiores veri et boni, ita ii qui in illis sunt; per `sapientiam autem Aegyptiorum' scientia earundem quae in gradu inferiore est; </p>
<p>quod per `Aegyptios' significentur {9}scientifica 
in genere, videatur n. 1164, 1165, 1462: [4] apud Jeremiam,      Sic dixit Jehovah, Surgite, ascendite contra Kedarem,      devastate filios orientis, tentoria et greges eorum sument,  
    cortinas eorum, et omnia vasa eorum, et camelos eorum sument,      xlix 28 [29]; </p>
<p>ibi quod per `filios orientis' intelligantur illi qui in cognitionibus boni et veri sunt, constat ex eo (x)quod 
`sument tentoria et greges eorum, tum cortinas, et omnia vasa eorum, ut et camelos'; per `tentoria' enim significantur sancta boni, n. 414, 1102, 2145, 2152, 3312, per `greges' bona charitatis, n. 
343, 2566; </p>
<p>per `cortinas' sancta vera, n. 2576, 3478, per `vasa' vera fidei, et scientifica, n. 3068, 3079, per `camelos' scientifica in communi, n. 3048, 3071, 3143, 3145; ita per `filios orientis' 
illi qui in illis {10}sunt, hoc est, qui in cognitionibus boni et veri. [5] Quod sapientes ab {11}orientalibus, qui venerunt ad Jesum, cum nasceretur, fuerint ex illis qui filii orientis dicti sunt, constare 
potest ex eo quod illi in cognitione fuerint quod nasciturus Dominus, et quod Adventum Ipsius sciverint ex stella quae illis apparuit in oriente, de quibus ita apud Matthaeum,      Cum 
nasceretur Jesus in Bethlehem Judaeae, . . . ecce      sapientes ab orientalibus venerunt in Hierosolymam, dicentes,      Ubi est natus Rex Judaeorum? vidimus enim Ipsius stellam ab      oriente, 
et venimus adorare Ipsum, ii 1, 2; </p>
<p>quod apud filios orientis qui e Syria, tale propheticum ab antiquo fuerit, constat a prophetia Bileami de Adventu Domini, apud Mosen,      Video Ipsum, et non nunc, 
conspicio Ipsum et non propinquus,      orietur stella ex Jacobo, et surget sceptrum ex Israele, Num.      xxiv 17; </p>
<p>quod Bileamus fuerit ex terra filiorum orientis seu ex Syria, patet ex his 
apud Mosen,      Edidit Bileamus enuntiatum suum, et dixit, A Syria adduxit me      Balakus rex Moabi, ex montibus orientis, Num. xxiii 7; </p>
<p>sapientes illi qui venerunt ad Jesum cum nasceretur, vocantur 
magi, sed ita dicti sunt sapientes {12}illo tempore, ut constat ex pluribus locis, ut Gen. xli 8; Exod. vii 11; Dan. ii 27; iv 3, 4 [A.V. 6, 7]; 1 Reg. v 10 [A.V. iv 30]; et passim apud Prophetas. [6] 
Quod `filii orientis' in opposito sensu significent cognitiones mali et falsi, ita illos qui in illis sunt, constat apud Esaiam,      Recedet aemulatio Ephraimi, et hostes Jehudae exscindentur; 
.      . . involabunt in humerum Philistaeorum versus mare, et simul      depraedabuntur filios orientis, xi 14: </p>
<p>apud Ezechielem,      Contra filios Ammonis, Ecce Ego tradidi te filiis orientis 
in      hereditatem, et collocabunt ordinationes suas in te, xxv 4,      10: </p>
<p>in Libro Judicum,      Cum seminavit Israel, et ascendit Midian et Amalek, et filii      orientis, et ascenderunt {13}supra 
illum, vi 3; </p>
<p>`Midian' pro illis qui in falso, quia non in vitae bono, n. 3242; </p>
<p>`Amalek' pro illis qui in falsis, quibus oppugnant vera, n. 1679; </p>
<p>`filii orientis' pro illis qui in cognitionibus 
falsi. @1 i et$ @2 tantum illa implantantur naturali hominis, in quo seu ubi sunt$ @3 tunc reponuntur in memoria naturali hominis, et inter cognitiones ibi referuntur; sed usque illa fieri nequeunt,
