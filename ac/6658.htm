<h3 align="center" class="ired">属天的奥秘 第6658节</h3>
<h4 align="center"></h4><p><strong>6658.</strong>“离开这地而上去”表教会将由此得以建立。这从“上去”和“地”的含义清楚可知：“上去”是指被提升，即被提升至教会更内在的事物（参看<a href="3084.htm">3084</a>，<a href="4539.htm">4539</a>，<a href="4969.htm">4969</a>，<a href="5406.htm">5406</a>，<a href="5817.htm">5817</a>，<a href="6007.htm">6007</a>节）；“地”，此处是指歌珊地，是指教会，如前所述（<a href="6649.htm">6649</a>节）。“离开这地上去，并进入迦南地”所表示的被提升至教会更内在的事物，是指教会将得以建立。诚然，当一个人出于情感行善时，教会就已经在他里面建立了；然而，在他与邪恶和虚假争战，从而经历试探之前，它仍未完全建立起来。只有经历了这一切之后，他才成为一个真正的教会，在这时被引入天堂；把以色列人带到迦南地就代表这种引入。</p>

And go up out of the land. That this signifies that thus the church will be set up anew, is evident from the signification of "going up," as being to be elevated, namely, toward more interior things 
of the church (see n. 3084, 4539, 4969, 5406, 5817, 6007), and from the signification of "land," here the land of Goshen, as being the church (of which above, n. 6649). To be elevated toward more interior 
things, which is signified by "going up out of the land and coming into the land of Canaan," denotes that the church will be set up anew. The church has indeed been set up anew with a man when he 
does what is good from affection; but still it has not been fully set up anew until he has fought against evils and falsities, thus until he has endured temptations; after this he becomes truly a church, 
and then is introduced into heaven, which is represented by the introduction of the sons of Israel into the land of Canaan. </p>

<p align="center"><b>Elliott(1983-1999) 6658</b></p><p><b>6658.</b>
'And go up out of the land' means that the Church will have thereby been established. This is clear from the meaning of 'going up' as being raised up, raised up towards more internal aspects of the Church, 
dealt with in <a href="3084.htm">3084</a>, <a href="4539.htm">4539</a>, <a href="4969.htm">4969</a>, <a href="5406.htm">5406</a>, <a href="5817.htm">5817</a>, <a href="6007.htm">6007</a>; and from the meaning of 'the land', the land of Goshen in this instance, as the Church, dealt with above in <a href="6649.htm">6649</a>. Being raised up towards more 
internal aspects of the Church, meant by going up out of the land and coming into the land of Canaan, is what 'the Church will have been established' implies. The Church has, it is true, been established 
with a person when he is motivated by affection to do good, yet it has not been fully established until after he has fought against evils and falsities, thus after he has undergone temptations. Only 
after that does he become truly a Church, at which point he is brought into heaven, represented by the bringing of the children of Israel into the land of Canaan. </p>

`Et ascendet e terra': quod significet quod sic instaurata erit Ecclesia, constat ex significatione `ascendere' quod sit elevari, nempe versus interiora quae Ecclesiae, de qua n. 3084, 4539, 4969, 5406, 
5817, 6007; et ex significatione `terrae,' hic terrae Goschen, quod sit Ecclesia, de qua supra n. 6649.  {1} Elevari versus interiora {2}, quod significatur per `ascendere e terra et venire in terram 
Canaanem,' est quod instaurata erit Ecclesia; {3} apud hominem quidem Ecclesia instaurata est cum ex affectione bonum agit, sed usque non plene instaurata est quam postquam pugnaverit contra mala 
et falsa, ita postquam {4}sustinuerit tentationes; dein fit ille vere Ecclesia, et tunc introducitur in caelum, quod repraesentatur per filiorum Israelis introductionem in terram Canaanem. 	@1 i Inde$ 	@2
