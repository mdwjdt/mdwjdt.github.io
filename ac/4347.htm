<h3 align="center" class="ired">属天的奥秘 第4347节</h3>
<h4 align="center"></h4><p><strong>4347.</strong>“一连七次俯伏在地”表一切事物的顺服。这从“俯伏在地”的含义清楚可知，“俯伏在地”是谦卑的感觉（<a href="2153.htm">2153</a>节），因而是顺服。“七次”表示顺服的最高程度，“雅各俯伏”表示一切事物的顺服，因为“雅各”代表一切事物的普遍存在，如刚才所述（<a href="4346.htm">4346</a>节）。<br />至于谦卑和顺服，很少有人知道当人敬拜时，这些在神性面前是很必要的。因此，他们也不知道这些行为会产生什么样的效果。那些不知道内层事物的人必以为是神性想要人的谦卑和顺服，如贪恋荣耀之人所认为的那样；因此，是神性想要来自人的荣耀，并被人归于祂的荣耀打动。但事实完全不同。神性不会贪恋荣耀，神性能从人得到什么荣耀呢？祂想要谦卑和顺服，不是为了祂自己，而是为了人。因为当人处于谦卑状态时，他会对自己里面的邪恶与虚假感到厌恶（<a href="2327.htm">2327</a>，<a href="2423.htm">2423</a>，<a href="3994.htm">3994</a>节），并由此除去它们。一旦它们被除去，神性就能以良善与真理流入进来。谁都能在自己里面意识到这一点。凡心高气傲的人都会陷入对自我的爱，不仅将自己置于他人之上，而且也不关心有关神性的任何事，从而回绝良善的流注，由此阻止它与真理的结合。这就是人在神性面前谦卑的真正原因。<br />由此明显可知，良善无法与真理结合，因而人无法重生，除非他使自己谦卑下来，变得顺服。谦卑和顺服之所以论及真理，是因为真理经由外在人流入，而良善经由内在人流入。经由外在人流入的事物含有谬误和由此而来的虚假及其情感在里面。而经由内在人流入的事物则不然，因为正是神性经由这内在人流入，并与真理会合，以便它们能够结合。由此可见何谓一切事物的顺服，也就是雅各在接近他哥哥之前，“一连七次俯伏在地”的意思。</p>

And bowed himself to the earth seven times. That this signifies the submission of all things, is evident from the signification of "bowing one's self to the earth," as being an effect of humiliation 
(n. 2153), consequently submission. The highest degree of submission is signified by "seven times," and the submission of all things by "Jacob's bowing himself;" for Jacob represents the universal of 
all things (as stated just above, n. 4346). [2] As regards humiliation and submission, few know why this must be in presence of the Divine when man is in worship; and consequently they do not know what 
it effects. They who are not in the knowledge of interior things cannot believe otherwise than that the Divine wills the humiliation and submission of man, as a man does who is in the lust of glory; 
and consequently that the Divine wills glory therefrom, and is affected with the glory which man ascribes to Him. But the case is altogether different. The Divine is not in any affection of glory, for 
what glory has the Divine from man? But He wills humiliation and submission, not for His own, but for man's sake. For when man is in humiliation he feels aversion for the evil and falsity in him (n. 
2327, 2423, 3994), and thus removes them, and on their removal the Divine can flow in with good and truth. Everyone may be aware of this in himself. He who is of elated mind is in the love of self, 
and not only sets himself above others, but also cares nothing for the Divine, and consequently rejects the influx of good, and thence its conjunction with truths. This is the genuine reason for man's 
humiliation before the Divine.  [3] It is therefore manifest that good cannot be conjoined with truths, thus that man cannot be regenerated, unless he humbles and submits himself. Humiliation and submission 
are predicated of truths because truths flow in through the external man, but good through the internal; and the things that inflow through the external man are attended with fallacies and the 
consequent falsities with their affections; whereas this is not the case with the things that inflow through the internal man, because it is the Divine that flows in through this, and comes to meet 
truths, in order that they may be conjoined. From this it is now manifest what is meant by the submission of all things, which is signified by Jacob's "bowing himself to the earth seven times, until he 
drew near even unto his brother." </p>

<p align="center"><b>Elliott(1983-1999) 4347</b></p><p><b>4347.</b>
'And bowed to the ground seven times' means the submission of all things. This is clear from the meaning of 'bonging to the ground' as the feeling of humility, dealt with in <a href="2153.htm">2153</a>, and so as submission. 
The highest degree of submission is meant by 'seven times' and the submission of all things by the fact that Jacob bowed down; for 'Jacob' represents the universal existence of all things, as stated 
immediately above in <a href="4346.htm">4346</a>. </p>
<p></p>
<p><b>[2]</b>
 As regards the expression of humility and submission, few know why these are necessary in the presence of the Divine when a person is engaged in worship. Nor consequently 
do they know what is accomplished by these actions. Those who have no knowledge of interior things cannot do other than believe that, like any human being bent on glory, the Divine desires people's 
expression of humility and their submission to Him, and that therefore the Divine desires glory from them and is affected by the glory which people ascribe to Him. But the truth of the matter is 
altogether different from this. The Divine is not moved by any desire for glory. Indeed what glory does the Divine have which comes from man? He desires humility and submission not for His own sake but 
for man's. For when humility is present in a person he turns away from the evil and falsity present in him, <a href="2327.htm">2327</a>, <a href="2423.htm">2423</a>, <a href="3994.htm">3994</a>, and in so doing removes them. Once these have been removed the Divine is 
able to flow in with good and truth. Anyone can recognize this within himself. One who is haughty is ruled by self-love and not only sets himself up above others but also does not care a thing about 
what is Divine; as a consequence he turns back the influx of good and therefore prevents it from being joined to truths. This is the real reason why a person should express humility in the presence of 
the Divine. </p>
<p></p>
<p><b>[3]</b>
 From this it is evident that good cannot be joined to truths, and so a person cannot be regenerated, unless he humbles himself and is submissive. Humility and submission are attributed 
to truths because truths flow in by way of the external man whereas good does so by way of the internal. The things which flow in by way of the external man hold within them misconceptions and consequently 
falsities together with affections for them. Not so the things which flow in by way of the internal man since it is the Divine which flows in by way of this internal man and goes to meet truths 
so that they may be joined together. From this one may now see the implications of 'the submission of all things', which is the meaning of 'Jacob bowed to the ground seven times until he came right 
up to his brother'. </p>

</p><b>4347.</b>
`Et incurvavit se terram septem vicibus': quod significet submissionem omnium, constat ex significatione `incurvare se terram' quod sit affectus humiliationis, de qua n. 2153, proinde submissio; 
submissionis summus gradus significatur per `septem vices,' et submissio omnium per quod `Jacob incurvavit se,' Jacob enim repraesentat universale omnium, ut mox supra n. 4346 dictum. [2] Quod humiliationem 
et submissionem attinet, pauci sciunt cur illa erit coram Divino quando homo est in cultu, inde etiam nec sciunt quid illa efficit; qui non in interiorum cognitione sunt, non aliter credere 
possunt quam quod Divinum velit humiliationem et submissionem hominis, sicut homo qui in cupiditate gloriae est, proinde quod Divinum velit inde gloriam et afficiatur gloria quam homo Illi {1} tribuit; 
sed res aliter prorsus se habet; Divinum non est in aliqua affectione gloriae, quid enim gloriae Divino ab homine; sed vult humiliationem et submissionem non Sui sed hominis causa; homo enim 
cum in humiliatione est, tunc aversatur malum et falsum apud se, n. 2327, 2423, 3994, et sic removet illa, quibus remotis Divinum potest influere cum bono et vero; quisque apud se hoc scire potest; 
qui animo elato est, in amore sui est et se praeponit non solum aliis, sed etiam Divinum nihil curat, consequenter influxum boni et inde conjunctionem ejus cum veris, rejicit; haec genuina causa 
humiliationis hominis est coram Divino; </p>
<p>[3] inde patet quod bonum non conjungi possit cum veris, ita non regenerari homo, nisi se humiliet et submittat: de veris praedicatur humiliatio et submissio 
quia vera influunt per externum hominem, bonum autem per internum; quae per externum hominem influunt, secum habent fallacias, et inde falsa cum illorum affectionibus; quae autem per internum, non 
ita, quia Divinum est quod per hunc influit, et obviam venit veris ut conjungantur.  Inde nunc patet quid intelligitur per submissionem omnium, quae significatur per quod `Jacob incurvaverit se terram 
septem vicibus, usque appropinquaverit se usque ad fratrem suum.'      @1 ipsi$ </p>
