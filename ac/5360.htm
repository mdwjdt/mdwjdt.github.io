<h3 align="center" class="ired">属天的奥秘 第5360节</h3>
<h4 align="center"></h4><p><strong>5360.</strong>“七个荒年就开始来了”表随后的荒凉状态。这从“年”和“（饥）荒”的含义清楚可知：“年”是指状态（参看<a href="482.htm">482</a>，<a href="487.htm">487</a>，<a href="488.htm">488</a>，<a href="493.htm">493</a>，<a href="893.htm">893</a>节）；“（饥）荒”是指对真理与良善的认知的缺乏（<a href="1460.htm">1460</a>，<a href="3364.htm">3364</a>节），因而是指荒凉。饥荒之所以表示这种缺乏或荒凉，是因为属天和属灵的良善无非是良善和真理。这些就是喂养天使和灵人的食物，是他们饿了时想吃，渴了时想喝的东西；因此，物质的食物也与它们相对应。饼对应于属天之爱，酒对应于属灵之爱，属于饼或食物，或属于酒或喝的的一切事物都是如此。所以，当缺乏这些滋养时，就会有一种“饥荒”；在圣言中，这种“饥荒”被称为“荒凉”和“荒废”，缺乏真理时是荒凉，缺乏良善时是荒废。<br />在圣言的许多经文中，经上论述了这种荒凉和荒废；在那里，它们被描述为地、国、城、族和民的荒凉。这种情形还被冠以“倒空”、“除灭或剪除”、“完结或终结”、“旷野”、“空虚”等名称；而这种状态本身被称为“耶和华的大日”、“祂发怒和报仇的日子”，以及“黑暗和幽暗”、“密云和幽冥”的日子、“察罚或追讨的日子”，还有“地要灭亡的日子”，因而是“末日”和“审判之日”。但人们因不明白圣言的内义，故至今还以为它是指地将要灭亡时的日子，那时复活和审判才开始发生。殊不知，“日子”在这些经文中表示一种状态，“地”表示教会；因此，“地将要灭亡时的日子”表示当教会将要走向终结之时的状态。故当在圣言中描述这种灭亡时，经上也会描述“新地”，“新地”表示一个新教会。关于这“新地新天”，可参看前面所述（<a href="1733.htm">1733</a>，<a href="1850.htm">1850</a>，<a href="2117.htm">2117</a>，<a href="2118.htm">2118</a>e，<a href="3355.htm">3355</a>e，<a href="4535.htm">4535</a>节）。严格来说，“荒废”和“荒凉”表示并描述了在新教会的状态之前到来的教会的最后状态。不过，荒凉和荒废也用来描述在人的重生之前到来的状态；这种状态在此由“七个荒年”来表示。</p>

<p align="center"><b>Potts(1905-1910) 5360</b></p><p><b>5360.</b>
And the seven years of famine began to come. That this signifies the following states of desolation, is evident from the signification of "years," as being states (see n. 482, 487, 488, 493, 893); and 
from the signification of "famine," as being a lack of the knowledges of truth and good (n. 1460, 3364), consequently desolation. That a famine denotes such a lack, or desolation, is because celestial 
and spiritual food are nothing else than good and truth. These are what angels and spirits are nourished by, and what they hunger for when hungry, and thirst for when thirsty; and therefore also material 
food corresponds thereto-as bread to celestial love, and wine to spiritual love, as well as everything that pertains to bread or food, and to wine or drink. When therefore there is a lack of such 
things, there is a "famine," and in the Word this is called "desolation" and "vastation" - "desolation" when truths fail, and "vastation" when goods fail. This desolation and vastation is treated of 
in many passages of the Word, and is there described by the desolation of the earth, of kingdoms, of cities, of nations, and of peoples, and is also termed a "pouring out," a "cutting off," a "consummation," 
a "desert," and a "void;" and the state itself is called the "great day of Jehovah," the "day of His wrath" and "vengeance," a "day of darkness," and "thick darkness," of "cloud" and of "obscurity," 
a "day of visitation," also the "day when the earth shall perish," thus the "last day" and the "day of judgment;" and because men have not understood the internal sense of the Word, they have 
hitherto supposed that it meant a day when the earth will perish, and that then for the first time will there be a resurrection and a judgment, not being aware that by a "day" in such passages is signified 
a state, and by the "earth" the church, and thus by a "day when the earth will perish," a state when the church will come to its end; therefore when this perishing is described in the Word, a "new 
earth" is also described, by which is meant a new church. (In regard to the "new earth" and "new heaven," see what is said above, n. 1733, 1850, 2117, 2118, 3355, 4535.) That last state of a church 
which precedes the state of a new church, is properly meant and described in the Word by "vastation" and "desolation." By the same words is described also the state that precedes man's regeneration, 
which state is here signified by the seven years of famine. </p>

<p align="center"><b>Elliott(1983-1999) 5360</b></p><p><b>5360.</b>
'And the seven years of famine began to come means the subsequent states of desolation. This is clear from the meaning of 'years' as states, dealt with in <a href="482.htm">482</a>, <a href="487.htm">487</a>, <a href="488.htm">488</a>, <a href="493.htm">493</a>, <a href="893.htm">893</a>; and from the meaning 
of 'famine' as an absence of cognitions of truth and good, dealt with in <a href="1460.htm">1460</a>, <a href="3364.htm">3364</a>, and consequently a desolation. The reason 'famine' means that absence of them, or a desolation, is that celestial 
and spiritual food consists in nothing else than goodness and truth. These are the food with which angels and spirits are fed and which they long for when they are hungry and thirst for when they are 
thirsty, and to which also material kinds of food therefore correspond. Bread corresponds to celestial love, wine to spiritual love, as does everything else which is a form of 'bread', meaning food, 
or of 'wine', meaning drink. When therefore these kinds of nourishment are lacking a famine exists, which in the Word is called desolation and vastation, desolation being when there is a lack of truths, 
vastation when there is a lack of forms of good. </p>
<p></p>
<p><b>[2]</b>
 Such desolation and vastation are spoken about in many places in the Word, where they are described as a desolation of the earth, kingdoms, cities, 
nations, or peoples. The same condition is also referred to as an emptying out, a cutting off, a bringing to a close, a wilderness, or a void, while the actual state is called the great day of 
Jehovah, the day of His wrath and vengeance, the day of darkness and thick darkness, of cloud and obscurity, the day of visitation, also the day when the earth will be destroyed, and so the last day or 
judgement day. But because people have not understood the internal sense of the Word they have imagined up to now that this is a day when the earth will be destroyed, at which point the resurrection 
and the judgement will begin to take place. Such people do not know that 'day' in this case means a state, and 'the earth' the Church, so that 'the day when the earth will be destroyed' means a state 
when the Church will pass away. In the Word therefore, when this passing away is referred to, a new earth is also mentioned, by which a new Church is meant, regarding which new earth together with a 
new heaven, see <a href="1733.htm">1733</a>, <a href="1850.htm">1850</a>, <a href="2117.htm">2117</a>, <a href="2118.htm">2118</a> (end), <a href="3355.htm">3355</a> (end), <a href="4535.htm">4535</a>. That final state of a Church which comes before the state of a new Church is meant and described in the Word, strictly speaking, by vastation 
and desolation. But desolation and vastation are also used to describe the state which comes before a person's regeneration; and that is the state meant here by 'the seven years of famine'. </p>

<p align="center"><b>Latin(1748-1756) 5360</b>
</p><b>5360.</b>
`Et inceperunt septem anni famis venire': quod significet status sequentes desolationis, constat a significatione `annorum' quod sint status, de qua n. 482, 487, 488, 493, 893; et a significatione `famis' 
quod sit defectus cognitionum veri et boni, de qua n. 1460, 3364, proinde desolatio. Quod `fames' sit ille defectus, seu {1} desolatio, est quia non aliud est cibus caelestis et spiritualis quam 
bonum et verum; haec sunt quibus angeli et spiritus nutriuntur, et quae in fame esuriunt inque siti sitiunt, quapropter etiam illis cibis cibi materiales correspondent, sicut `panis' amori caelesti, 
`vinum' amori spirituali, et praeterea omnia et singula quae panis seu cibi ac vini seu potus sunt; cum itaque deficiunt talia, est fames, et vocatur in Verbo desolatio et vastatio, desolatio cum deficiunt 
vera, et vastatio cum deficiunt bona; multis in locis in Verbo de desolatione et vastatione illa agitur, et ibi describitur per desolationem terrae, regnorum, urbium, gentium, populorum, ac nuncupatur 
quoque exinanitio, excisio, consummatio, {2}desertum, vacuum, [2] ac ipse ille status vocatur dies magnus Jehovae, dies excandescentiae et vindictae Ipsius, dies tenebrarum et caliginis, nubis 
et obscuritatis, dies visitationis, etiam dies quando peritura terra, ita dies ultimus ac dies judicii; et quia non intellexerunt sensum internum Verbi, putarunt hactenus quod sit dies quando peritura 
terra, et quod tunc primum resurrectio (c)et judicium, non scientes quod per `diem' ibi significetur status, et per `terram' Ecclesia; ita per `diem quando peritura terra' status quando Ecclesia interitura; 
quapropter {3} in Verbo, cum de interitu hoc agitur, etiam de nova terra agitur, per quam Ecclesia nova intelligitur; de nova terra et de novo caelo, videatur n. 1733, 1850, 2117, 2118 fin., 
3355 fin., 4535; ultimus ille status Ecclesiae qui praecedit statum novae Ecclesiae, in Verbo proprie per vastationem et desolationem intelligitur et describitur; per desolationem et vastationem in Verbo 
describitur etiam status qui praecedit regenerationem hominis, qui status hic significatur per `septem annos famis'. @1 i sit$ @2 defectum$ @3 i etiam$ </p>
