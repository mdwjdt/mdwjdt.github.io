<h4 align="center"></h4><p><strong>7287.</strong>出埃及记7:8-13.耶和华晓谕摩西、亚伦说，法老若告诉你们说，你们行件奇事吧！你就要对亚伦说，拿你的杖，把它丢在法老面前，它就会变作水蛇。摩西、亚伦到法老那里去，就照耶和华所吩咐的行；亚伦把杖丢在法老和他臣仆面前，杖就变作水蛇。于是，法老召了智慧人和术士来；他们也是埃及的术士，也用邪术照样行了。他们各人丢下自己的杖，杖就变作水蛇；但亚伦的杖吞了他们的杖。法老心里刚硬，不听他们；正如耶和华所说的。<br />“耶和华晓谕摩西、亚伦说”表指示。“法老若告诉你们”表如果他们对神性心存怀疑。“说，你们行件奇事吧”表因此他们想要得到证据。“你就要对亚伦说”表流注和交流。“拿你的杖，把它丢在法老面前”表所展示的能力。“它就会变作水蛇”表纯粹的幻觉和衍生的虚假由此会在他们当中掌权。“摩西、亚伦到法老那里去，就照耶和华所吩咐的行”表付诸实施。“亚伦把杖丢在法老和他臣仆面前，杖就变作水蛇”表纯粹的幻觉和衍生的虚假在他们当中掌权。“于是，法老召了智慧人和术士来”表对神性秩序的滥用。“他们也是埃及的术士，也用邪术照样行了”表他们通过败坏秩序所关注的目的而做了表面相似的事。“他们各人丢下自己的杖，杖就变作水蛇”表源于他们在洞察真理时变得迟钝的秩序的能力。“但亚伦的杖吞了他们的杖”表这能力从他们身上被夺走。“法老心里刚硬”表固执。“不听他们”表那些陷入由虚假所生的邪恶之人不接受。“正如耶和华所说的”表正如所预言的。</p>

Verses 8-13. And Jehovah said unto Moses and unto Aaron, saying, When Pharaoh shall say unto you, saying, Give you a wonder, then thou shalt say unto Aaron, Take thy rod, and cast it before Pharaoh; 
it shall become a water-serpent. And Moses and Aaron came unto Pharaoh; and they did so as Jehovah had commanded; and Aaron cast his rod before Pharaoh and before his servants, and it became a water-serpent. 
And Pharaoh called also the wise men and the sorcerers; and they also, the magicians of Egypt, did so with their enchantments. And they cast forth every man his rod, and they became water-serpents; 
and Aaron's rod swallowed up their rods. And Pharaoh's heart was made firm, and he heard them not; as Jehovah had spoken. "And Jehovah said unto Moses and unto Aaron, saying," signifies instruction; 
"When Pharaoh shall say unto you," signifies if they have doubt concerning the Divine; "saying, give you a wonder," signifies and they therefore desire to be confirmed; "then thou shalt say unto 
Aaron," signifies influx and communication; "Take thy rod, and cast it before Pharaoh," signifies the power which is shown; "it shall become a water-serpent," signifies that thereby mere fallacies and 
the derivative falsities will reign among them; "and Moses and Aaron came unto Pharaoh, and they did so as Jehovah had commanded," signifies the effect; "and Aaron cast his rod before Pharaoh and before 
his servants, and it became a water-serpent," signifies that mere fallacies and the derivative falsities would reign among them; "and Pharaoh called also the wise men and the sorcerers," signifies 
abuse of Divine order; "and they also, the magicians of Egypt, did so with their enchantments," signifies thus to appearance the same by perverting the ends of order; "and they cast forth every man his 
rod, and they became water-serpents," signifies power from order that they became dull in respect to the noticing of truth; "and Aaron's rod swallowed up their rods," signifies that this power was 
taken away from them; "and Pharaoh's heart was made firm," signifies obstinacy; "and he heard them not," signifies that they who were in evils from falsities did not receive; "as Jehovah had spoken," 
signifies prediction. </p>

Verses 8-13 And Jehovah said to Moses and to Aaron - He said, When Pharaoh says to you - when he says, Perform a wonder;<A name="fntext1"></a><A href="#fn1"><sup>a</sup></a> you shall say to Aaron, Take your rod and throw it down in front of Pharaoh. 
It will then be a water-serpent. And Moses and Aaron went to Pharaoh and did so, as Jehovah had commanded; and Aaron threw down his rod in front of Pharaoh, and in front of his servants, and it was made 
into a water-serpent. And Pharaoh also called the wise men and sorcerers, and they also, the magicians of Egypt, did so with their enchantments. And they threw down each one his rod, and they were

<p>'And Jehovah said to Moses and to Aaron - 
He said' means instruction. 'When Pharaoh says to you' means if they entertain doubt regarding the Divine. 'When he says, Perform a wonder' means and they therefore wish to receive proof. 'You shall say 
to Aaron' means influx and communication. 'Take your rod and throw it down in front of Pharaoh' means power which is demonstrated. 'It will then be a water-serpent' means by the prospect that sheer 
illusions and resulting falsities will reign among them. 'And Moses and Aaron went to Pharaoh and did so, as Jehovah had commanded' means putting it into effect. 'And Aaron threw down his rod in front 
of Pharaoh and his servants, and it was made into a water-serpent' means that sheer illusions and resulting falsities reigned among them. 'And Pharaoh also called the wise men and sorcerers' means a 
misuse of Divine order. 'And they also, the magicians of Egypt, did so with their enchantments' means that thus to outward appearances they did something similar, by perverting the ends that order has 
in view. 'And they threw down each one his rod, and they were made into water-serpents' means power derived from order by which they became obtuse in their discernment of truth. 'And Aaron's rod swallowed 
up their rods' means that this power was taken away from them. 'And Pharaoh's heart was unyielding' means obstinacy. 'And he did not hear them' means that those governed by evils arising from falsities 
were unreceptive. As Jehovah had spoken' means as accorded with what had been foretold.

Vers. 8-13.  Et dixit Jehovah ad Moschen et ad Aharonem, dicendo, Quod cum dixerit ad vos Pharao, dicendo, Date vobis prodigium; et dices ad Aharonem, Accipe baculum tuum, et projice coram Pharaone, 
erit in serpentem aqueum.  Et venit Moscheh et Aharon ad Pharaonem, et fecerunt ita quemadmodum praecepit Jehovah, et projecit Aharon baculum suum coram Pharaone, et coram servis illius, et factus in 
serpentem aqueum.  Et vocavit etiam Pharao sapientes et praestigiatores, et fecerunt etiam illi, magi Aegypti, incantationibus suis ita.  Et projecerunt quisque baculum suum, et facti in serpentes aqueos; 
et deglutivit baculus Aharonis baculos illorum.  Et obfirmatum cor Pharaonis, et non audivit ad illos, quemadmodum locutus Jehovah.  `Et dixit Jehovah ad Moschen et ad Aharonem, dicendo' significat 
instructionem: `Quod cum dixerit ad vos Pharao' significat si dubium illis de Divino: `dicendo, Date prodigium' significat et ideo confirmari volunt: `et dices (x)ad Aharonem' significat influxum 
et communicationem: `Accipe baculum tuum, et projice coram Pharaone' significat potentiam quae ostenditur: `erit in serpentem aqueum' significat per id quod merae fallaciae et inde falsa regnabunt apud 
illos: `et venit Moscheh et Aharon ad Pharaonem, et fecerunt ita quemadmodum praecepit Jehovah' significat effectum: `et projecit Aharon baculum suum coram Pharaone et servis ejus, et factus in serpentem 
aqueum' significat quod merae fallaciae et inde falsa regnarent apud illos: `et vocavit etiam Pharao sapientes et praestigiatores' significat abusum ordinis Divini: `et fecerunt etiam illi, magi 
Aegypti, incantationibus suis' significat ita ad apparentiam simile pervertendo fines ordinis: `et projecerunt quisque baculum suum, et facti in serpentes aqueos' significat potentiam ex ordine quod 
hebetes facti quoad apperceptionem veri: `et (x)deglutivit baculus Aharonis baculos illorum' significat quod ea potentia illis adempta sit: `et obfirmatum cor Pharaonis' significat obstinationem: `et 
non audivit ad illos' significat quod qui in malis ex falsis non (x)reciperent: `quemadmodum locutus Jehovah' significat secundum praedictionem. </p>
