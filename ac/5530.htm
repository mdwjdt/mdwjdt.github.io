<h3 align="center" class="ired">属天的奥秘 第5530节</h3>
<h4 align="center"></h4><p><strong>5530.</strong>“看哪，各人成捆的银子”表白白被赐予的井然有序的成组真理。这从“捆”和“银子”的含义清楚可知：一“捆”是指井然有序的一组，如下文所述；“银子”是指真理（参看<a href="1551.htm">1551</a>，<a href="2954.htm">2954</a>节），“各人的银子都在自己的口袋里”表示井然有序的一组组被白白赐予。一“捆”之所以表示井然有序的一组，是因为人里面的真理被排列并整理成系列。那些与他的爱最和谐的真理在中间，与他的爱不怎么和谐的真理在中间真理的周围，而与他的爱根本不和谐的真理则被推到边缘。在这整个系列之外的，则是与他的爱相反的真理。因此，在中间的真理被称为血亲关系，因为爱产生血亲关系；相对较远的真理则被称为关联；这些关联在边缘逐渐消失。人里面的所有真理都被排列成这样的系列，由“捆”来表示。<br />由此清楚可知，那些陷入自我之爱和尘世之爱的人是何情形，那些处于对神和对邻之爱的人又是何情形。对那些陷入自我之爱和尘世之爱的人来说，诸如支持这些爱的那类真理在中间，而给予它们很少支持的真理在边缘，与它们相反的真理，如与对神之爱和对邻之爱有关的真理，则被扔在外边。这就是地狱之人的状态。这也解释了为何有时在他们周围会看到一束光；但在他们自己所在的这束光里面却有一个黑暗、恐怖和可怕的中心。然而，对天使来说，被属天和属灵之爱的良善所点燃的光辉在中心，包裹它的一束光或亮白在周围。那些如此显现的人就是主的形像；因为主自己在向彼得、雅各和约翰显示祂的神性时：<br />脸面明亮如日头，衣裳洁白如光。（马太福音<a href="http://39-27.cn/太17.2.htm">17:2</a>）<br />为主形像的天使出现在周围一片亮白的光辉中，这一事实从主的使者明显看出来，他从天上下来，把石头从墓门滚开：<br />他的像貌如同闪电，衣服洁白如雪。（马太福音<a href="http://39-27.cn/太28.3.htm">28:3</a>）</p>

And behold everyone's bundle of silver. That this signifies the settings in order of truths bestowed gratis, is evident from the signification of a "bundle," as being a setting in order (of which in 
what follows); and from the signification of "silver," as being truth (see n. 1551, 2954); by "everyone having it in his sack" is signified that these were bestowed gratis. That a "bundle" denotes a setting 
in order is because the truths with man are disposed and ordered in series. Those most in agreement with his loves are in the midst, those not so much in agreement are at the sides, finally those 
not at all in agreement are rejected to the outermost circumferences. Outside of this series are the things contrary to the loves. Wherefore those things which are in the midst are called blood-relations, 
for love produces blood-relationship, and those which are more remote are connections; and at the ultimate boundaries the connections die away. All things in man are disposed in such series, and 
are signified by "bundles."  [2] From this it is plainly evident how the case is with those who are in the loves of self and of the world, and how with those who are in love to God and toward the 
neighbor. With those who are in the loves of self and of the world, such things as favor these loves are in the midst, and such as slightly favor them are in the circumferences; and the things which are 
contrary to them, as those which relate to love to God and love toward the neighbor, are thrown out. In such a state are the infernals. And this order sometimes causes a lucidity to appear about them; 
but within this lucidity, where they themselves are, all is dusky, monstrous, and horrible. But with the angels there is a flaming radiance in the midst from the good of celestial and spiritual love, 
and from this there is a light or brightness round about. They who so appear are likenesses of the Lord; for the Lord Himself, when He showed His divine to Peter, James, and John, "shone in the face 
as the sun, and His raiment became as the light" (Matt. 17:2). That the angels who are likenesses appear in flaming radiance and hence in white is plain from the angel who descended from heaven and 
rolled away the stone from the door of the sepulcher:       His appearance was as lightning, and his raiment white as snow (Matt. 28:3). </p>

'That behold, each man's bundle of silver' means truths in ordered groups freely given. This is clear from the meaning of 'bundle' as an ordered group, dealt with below; and from the meaning of 'silver' 
as truth, dealt with in <a href="1551.htm">1551</a>, <a href="2954.htm">2954</a> - 'each man's in his sack' meaning that the ordered groups were freely given. The reason why 'bundle' means an ordered group is that the truths present with a person 
are arranged and ordered into sequences. The truths most in harmony with his loves lie in the middle; ones less in harmony with his loves lie immediately around those in the middle, while truths 
that are not at all in harmony with his loves lie pushed back to the peripheries. And lying outside that whole sequence are those which are contrary to his loves. The truths in the middle are therefore 
called kindred ones since love is the creator of kinship; those that are more remote are called associated ones, extending to and ending with associates that are on the fringes. All the truths present 
with a person are arranged into sequences like this and are meant by 'bundles'. </p>

 From this one may see quite clearly what the situation is with those governed by self-love and love of the world 
and what it is with those governed by love to God and towards their neighbour. With people governed by self-love and love of the world the kinds of truths that lend support to these loves are in the 
middle, while those giving them little support are on the peripheries, and those contrary to them, such as truths to do with loving God and loving their neighbour, are cast to the outside. Such is the 
state of those in hell. This also explains why sometimes a band of light is seen around them; but inside this band where they themselves are, there exists a dark, gruesome, and horrible centre. With 
angels however there is a radiance at the centre, fuelled by the good of celestial and spiritual love, with a band of light or shining whiteness clothing it round about. Those who appear like this are 
likenesses of the Lord, for when He Himself revealed His Divinity to Peter, James, and John, He shone with His face like the sun, and His garments became like the light, <a href="http://bible.gospelcom.net/cgi-bin/bible?passage=Matt%2017:2&amp;version=ESV&amp;interface=print&amp;showfn=yes&amp;showxref">Matt 17:2</a>. The fact that angels, 
who are likenesses of Him, are seen in a radiance with a surrounding whiteness is evident from the angel who came down from heaven and rolled the stone away from the door of the tomb,  </p>

`Et ecce cuivis colligatio argenti sui': quod significet ordinationes verorum donatas gratis, constat ex significatione `colligationis' seu fasciculi quod sit ordinatio, de qua sequitur; et ex significatione 
`argenti' quod sit verum, de qua n. 1551, 2954; per quod {1} `cuivis in sacco suo' significatur quod donatae gratis.  Quod `colligatio' seu fasciculus sit ordinatio, inde est quia vera apud 
hominem in series disposita et ordinata sunt; quae amoribus {2} maxime conveniunt, in medio sunt, quae non ita conveniunt, ad latera sunt, et tandem quae prorsus non conveniunt, ad ultimas peripherias 
rejecta sunt; extra illam seriem {1} sunt illa quae amoribus contraria sunt; quapropter illa quae in medio sunt, vocantur consanguinea, amor enim facit consanguineum, quae remotiora sunt affinia, ad 
ultimos terminos affinitates exspirant; in tales series disposita sunt omnia apud hominem, et significantur per fasciculos et `colligationes'; [2] inde manifeste patet quomodo se habet cum illis qui in 
amoribus sui et mundi sunt, et quomodo cum illis qui in amore in Deum et erga proximum; apud illos qui in amoribus sui et mundi sunt, sunt talia quae illis amoribus favent in medio, et quae parum favent 
in peripheriis, et foras rejecta sunt quae sunt {3} contraria, ut sunt illa quae amoris in Deum et amoris erga proximum; in tali statu sunt infernales; inde etiam quandoque apparet lucidum circum 
illos, sed intra hoc lucidum ubi ipsi, est furvum, monstrosum et horrendum; at apud angelos est flammeum jubar in medio ex bono amoris caelestis et spiritualis, et inde lucidum aut candidum circumcirca; 
qui ita apparent, sunt similitudines Domini; Ipse enim Dominus cum Divinum Suum ostendit Petro, Jacobo et Johanni, Splenduit facie sicut sol, et vestimenta Ipsius facta sunt sicut {4} lux Matth.

<p>quod angeli qui similitudines, in flammeo jubare et inde in albo appareant, patet ab angelo qui descendit e caelo, et devolvit lapidem ab ostio sepulcri, Erat species ejus sicut fulgur, et vestimentum
