<h3 align="center" class="ired">属天的奥秘 第8685节</h3>
<h4 align="center"></h4><p><strong>8685.</strong>“摩西坐着审判百姓”表在那些属于属灵教会的人出于良善行事之前的状态下，神之真理对他们所作的安排。这从“摩西”和以色列的代表，以及“审判”的含义清楚可知。“摩西”是指直接从主发出的神之真理（参看<a href="7010.htm">7010</a>，<a href="7382.htm">7382</a>节）；“审判”是指作出一种安排。“审判”在此之所以表示作出一种安排，是因为神之真理并不审判任何人，而是流入并安排事物，好叫它自己能被接受；它被接受之后，审判就照着秩序的律法进行；这就是主的审判（马太福音<a href="http://39-27.cn/太25.31.htm">25:31</a>至末尾，约翰福音<a href="http://39-27.cn/约5.22.htm">5:22</a>，<a href="http://39-27.cn/约5.26.htm">26</a>，<a href="http://39-27.cn/约5.27.htm">27</a>，<a href="http://39-27.cn/约5.30.htm">30</a>；<a href="http://39-27.cn/约9.39.htm">9:39</a>）所表示的，这从主在那里的话明显看出来，祂说，祂不审判任何人（约翰福音<a href="http://39-27.cn/约3.17.htm">3:17</a>-<a href="http://39-27.cn/约3.21.htm">21</a>；<a href="http://39-27.cn/约8.15.htm">8:15</a>；<a href="http://39-27.cn/约12.47.htm">12:47</a>，<a href="http://39-27.cn/约12.48.htm">48</a>）。以色列，即此处的“百姓”，是指那些属于属灵教会的人（参看<a href="8645.htm">8645</a>节）。由此明显可知，“摩西坐着审判百姓”表示直接从主发出的神之真理对那些属于属灵教会的人所作的安排。<br />他们出于良善行事之前的状态下就是如此，这一点从接下来的内容明显看出来。因为正在重生并成为一个教会的人具有两种状态：在第一种状态下，他出于真理行事；在第二种状态下，他出于良善行事（关于这两种状态，可参看<a href="8516.htm">8516</a>，<a href="8539.htm">8539</a>，<a href="8643.htm">8643</a>，<a href="8648.htm">8648</a>，<a href="8658.htm">8658</a>节）。在这两种状态下，此人被主引导；不过，在第一种状态下，他通过直接流注被引导，而在第二种状态下，既通过直接流注，也通过间接流注被引导。关于直接和间接来自主的良善与真理的流注，可参看前文（<a href="6472.htm">6472</a>-<a href="6478.htm">6478</a>，<a href="6982.htm">6982</a>，<a href="6985.htm">6985</a>，<a href="6996.htm">6996</a>，<a href="7054.htm">7054</a>-<a href="7058.htm">7058</a>，<a href="7270.htm">7270</a>节）。摩西独自审判百姓代表直接流注；但选出来的千夫长、百夫长、五十夫长、十夫长审判小事，大事呈到摩西这里代表直接和间接的流注，如下文所述。不过，这些事都是几乎无人能理解的奥秘，除非他被主启示，并通过启示而拥有觉知。诚然，这两种流注，以及它们所产生的效果可以描述，但人若没有来自天堂的觉知，仍对它们没有一个正确的理解；来自天堂的觉知只能被赋予那些拥有对源于良善的真理的爱之人；然而，如果这不是一种对源于纯正良善的真理之爱，这种觉知也不会被赋予他们。</p>

And Moses sat to judge the people. That this signifies the disposing of truth Divine with those who were of the spiritual church in the state before it was from good, is evident from the representation 
of Moses, as being the truth Divine that proceeds immediately from the Lord (see n. 7010, 7382); from the signification of "judging," as being a disposing. That "judging" here denotes a disposing, 
is because truth Divine does not judge anyone, but flows in and disposes that it may be received, and according to the reception judgment then takes place in accordance with the laws of order, which is 
meant by the judgment of the Lord (Matt. 25:31 to end, John 5:22, 26, 27, 30; 9:39), as is evident from the Lord's words where He says that He "judges no man" (John 3:17-21; 8:15; 12:47, 48). And from 
the representation of Israel, who is here "the people," as being those who are of the spiritual church (see above n. 8645). From all this it is evident that by "Moses sat to judge the people," is signified 
the disposing of the truth Divine that proceeds immediately from the Lord with those who are of the spiritual church. [2] That it denotes in a state before it is from good, is evident from what 
follows. For the man who is being regenerated and becoming a church has two states; in the first state he acts from truth, in the second from good (on which see n. 8516, 8539, 8643, 8648, 8658). In 
both states the man is led by the Lord; but in the first by immediate influx, and in the second by influx both immediate and mediate. (Concerning the influx of good and truth from the Lord, immediate 
and mediate, see n. 6472-6478, 6982, 6985, 6996, 7054-7058, 7270.) Immediate influx is represented by Moses judging the people alone; but influx both immediate and mediate, by the princes of thousands, 
of hundreds, of fifties, and of tens, being chosen, to judge small affairs, and to refer great affairs to Moses (of which below). But these are arcana which scarcely anyone can understand, except 
one who is in enlightenment from the Lord, and through enlightenment in perception. These two kinds of influx, and also the consequent effects, can indeed be described, but still they do not fall rightly 
into the thought unless there is perception from heaven; and perception from heaven is not given except with those who are in the love of truth from good; and not even then unless they are in the 
love of truth from genuine good. </p>

<p align="center"><b>Elliott(1983-1999) 8685</b></p><p><b>8685.</b>
'That Moses sat to judge the people' means the arrangement, effected by God's truth, with those belonging to the spiritual Church in the state before their actions sprang from good. This is clear from 
the representation of 'Moses' as God's truth going forth directly from the Lord, dealt with in <a href="7010.htm">7010</a>, <a href="7382.htm">7382</a>; from the meaning of 'judging' as effecting an arrangement (the reason why 'judging' has this 
meaning here is that God's truth does not judge anyone, but flows in and arranges things for its own reception, and after it has been received judgement then takes place in accordance with the laws 
of order; this is what is meant by the Lord's judgement in <a href="http://bible.gospelcom.net/cgi-bin/bible?passage=Matt%2025:31-end&amp;version=ESV&amp;interface=print&amp;showfn=yes&amp;showxref">Matt 25:31-end</a>; <a href="http://bible.gospelcom.net/cgi-bin/bible?passage=John%205:22,%2026,%2027,%2030;%209:39&amp;version=ESV&amp;interface=print&amp;showfn=yes&amp;showxref">John 5:22, 26, 27, 30; 9:39</a>, as is clear from the Lord's words where He says that He judges no one, <a href="http://bible.gospelcom.net/cgi-bin/bible?passage=John%203:17-21;%207:24;%2012:47,48)&amp;version=ESV&amp;interface=print&amp;showfn=yes&amp;showxref">John 3:17-21; 7:24; 12:47,48)</a>; 
and from the representation of Israel, to whom 'the people' refers here, as those belonging to the spiritual Church, dealt with above in <a href="8645.htm">8645</a>. From all this it is evident that 'Moses sat to judge 
the people' means the arrangement, effected by God's truth going forth directly from the Lord, with those belonging to the spiritual Church. </p>

 This is so in the state before their actions spring 
from good, as is clear from what follows. There are two states that the person who is being regenerated and coming to have the Church within him passes through. In the first state his actions spring 
from truth, in the second from good, regarding which states see <a href="8516.htm">8516</a>, <a href="8539.htm">8539</a>, <a href="8643.htm">8643</a>, <a href="8648.htm">8648</a>, <a href="8658.htm">8658</a>. In both states the person is led by the Lord, in the first however through direct influx, but in the second 
through influx both direct and indirect. Regarding the influx of goodness and truth from the Lord in direct and indirect ways, see <a href="6472.htm">6472</a>-<a href="6478.htm">6478</a>, <a href="6982.htm">6982</a>, <a href="6985.htm">6985</a>, <a href="6996.htm">6996</a>, <a href="7054.htm">7054</a>-<a href="7058.htm">7058</a>, <a href="7270.htm">7270</a>. Direct influx is represented 
by the situation in which Moses alone judged the people, and influx both direct and indirect by the situation in which the rulers of thousands, hundreds, fifties, and tens who had been chosen 
were themselves to judge small matters, and to refer large matters to Moses, spoken of further on. But these things are arcana which hardly anyone can understand unless he is enlightened by the Lord, 
and being enlightened has perception. Those kinds of influx and also the effects they produce can, it is true, be described. Nevertheless a person can have no proper understanding of them without perception 
from heaven; and perception from heaven comes only to those who have a love of truth springing from good, yet not even to them unless it is a love of truth springing from genuine good. </p>

`Et {1}sedit Moscheh ad judicandum populum': quod significet veri Divini dispositionem apud illos qui ab Ecclesia spirituali in statu antequam ex bono, constat (c)ex repraesentatione `Moschis' quod 
sit verum Divinum immediate a Domino procedens, de qua n. 7010, 7382, ex significatione `judicare' quod sit dispositio; quod `judicare' hic sit dispositio, est quia verum Divinum non judicat aliquem, 
sed influit et disponit ut recipiatur; ex receptione dein fit judicium secundum leges ordinis; hoc intelligitur per judicium Domini, Matth. xxv 31 -- fin.; Joh. v 22, 26, 27, 30, ix 39; quod {2}id intelligatur, 
constat a Domini verbis ubi dicit quod neminem judicet, Joh. iii 17-21, {3}vii 24, xii 47, 48; ex repraesentatione `Israelis,' qui hic est `populus,' quod sint qui ab Ecclesia spirituali, de 
qua supra n. 8645; ex his patet quod per `{1}sedit Moscheh ad judicandum populum' significetur veri Divini immediate a Domino procedentis dispositio apud illos qui ab Ecclesia spirituali; quod sit in 
statu antequam ex bono, constat ex 2 illis quae sequuntur; sunt enim bini status homini qui regeneratur et fit Ecclesia {4}; {5}in primo statu agit ex vero, {6}in altero ex bono, de quibus videatur 
n. 8516, 8539, 8643, 8648, 8658; in utroque statu ducitur homo a Domino, sed in primo per influxum immediatum, in altero autem per influxum tam immediatum quam mediatum; de influxu boni et veri a Domino 
immediato et mediato, videatur n. 6472-6478, 6982, 6985, 6996, 7054-7058, 7270; influxus immediatus repraesentatur {7} per quod Moscheh judicaverit populum solus, at influxus tam immediatus {8}quam 
mediatus per quod principes (x)millenorum, centenorum, quinquagenorum, et decadum, electi fuerint, qui res parvas judicarent, et res magnas referrent ad Moschen, de quibus in sequentibus.  Sed haec sunt 
arcana quae vix aliquis intelligere potest nisi qui in illustratione est a Domino, et per illustrationem in perceptione; describi quidem possunt influxus illi, et quoque effectus inde, sed usque non 
cadunt rite in cogitationem nisi perceptio ex caelo sit; et perceptio ex caelo non datur nisi apud illos qui in amore veri ex bono sunt; et ne sic quidem, nisi in amore veri ex genuino bono. 	@1 stetit
