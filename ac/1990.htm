<h3 align="center" class="ired">属天的奥秘 第1990节</h3>
<h4 align="center"></h4><p><strong>1990.</strong>“耶和华向亚伯兰显现”表显现。这是显而易见的，无需解释。因为如前所述，亚伯兰代表主。全世界从来没有人见过耶和华，主的父，唯独主见过祂，如祂自己在约翰福音中所说的：<br />从来没有人看见神，只有在父怀里的独生子将他表明出来。（约翰福音<a href="http://39-27.cn/约1.18.htm">1:18</a>）<br />同一福音书：<br />你们从来没有听见祂的声音，也没有看见他的形像。（约翰福音<a href="http://39-27.cn/约5.37.htm">5:37</a>）<br /><br />没人见过父，惟独与父同在的，祂看见过父。（约翰福音<a href="http://39-27.cn/约6.46.htm">6:46</a>）<br />无限本身远远高于天堂和人的至内在，只能凭借神性人显明，而唯有主才拥有这神性人。无限与有限的人根本不可能通过其它源头进行交流，这也解释了为何当耶和华显现给上古教会成员，后来显现给洪水后的古教会，再后来显现给亚伯拉罕和众先知时，祂向他们显现为一个人。这就是主，祂在约翰福音公开教导这一点：<br />你们的祖宗亚伯拉罕欢欢喜喜地仰望我的日子，既看见了，就快乐。我实实在在地告诉你们：还没有亚伯拉罕就有了我。（约翰福音<a href="http://39-27.cn/约8.56.htm">8:56</a>，<a href="http://39-27.cn/约8.58.htm">58</a>）<br />先知书也教导了这一点，如但以理书，见有一位像“人子”的（但以理书<a href="http://39-27.cn/但7.13.htm">7:13</a>）。<br />由上述经文清楚可知，无限存在，也就是耶和华唯独通过人性本质，因而通过主向人显现，因此除了唯独主外，从没向任何人显现过。人类彻底远离神性，沉浸于污秽的欲望，并由此沉浸于纯粹的肉体和世俗之物后，为了还能与人类同在、与其结合，主经由出生实实在在地披上人性本质。祂这样做是为了无限神性能与相距如此遥远的人类联结起来。否则，人类必因诅咒的死亡而永远灭亡了。至于另一个奥秘，就是当祂处于谦卑状态时，即祂还没有将人性本质与神性本质充分融合，并荣耀祂的人性本质之前，耶和华在主的人身里面显现这个奥秘，蒙主怜悯，我将在下文以尽可能让人理解的方式予以阐明。</p>

Jehovah appeared unto Abram. That this signifies manifestation, is evident without explication, for as before said the Lord is represented by Abram. No man in the whole world has seen Jehovah, the Father 
of the Lord; but the Lord alone saw Him, as He Himself has said in John: </p>
<p>     No one hath seen God at any time the Only-Begotten Son, who is in the bosom of the Father, He hath set Him forth (John 
1:18). Again: </p>
<p>     Ye have neither heard His voice at any time, nor seen His shape (John 5:37). And again: </p>
<p>     Not that anyone hath seen the Father save He that is with the Father; He hath seen 
the Father (John 6:46). [2] The Infinite Itself, which is above all the heavens, and is over the inmost things that appertain to man, cannot be made manifest, except through the Divine Human which 
appertains to the Lord alone. No communication of the Infinite with those who are finite is possible from any other source, and this is also the reason that when Jehovah appeared to the men of the Most 
Ancient Church, and afterwards to the Ancient Church that was after the flood, and then again to Abraham and the prophets, He was manifested to them as a man. That this was the Lord, He teaches openly 
in John: </p>
<p>     Your father Abraham rejoiced to see My day, and he saw it, and was glad; verily, verily, I say unto you, Before Abraham was, I am (John 8:56, 58). Also in the Prophets-as in Daniel, 
by whom He was seen as the Son of man (Dan. 7:13).  [3] From these passages it may be seen that the Infinite Esse, which is Jehovah, could not possibly be manifested to man except through the Human 
Essence, thus except through the Lord; and therefore that it has been manifested to no one save the Lord alone. That He might also be present and be conjoined with man, after man had completely removed 
himself from the Divine, and had immersed himself in foul cupidities, and thereby in mere bodily and earthly things, He assumed in actuality the Human Essence itself by birth, that so He might still 
adjoin the Infinite Divine to man now so far removed; otherwise men would have perished to eternity with the death of the damned. The other arcana concerning the manifestation of Jehovah in the Lord's 
Human, when He was in a state of humiliation, before He had fully united the Human Essence to the Divine Essence, and had glorified it, will of the Lord's Divine mercy be set forth in what follows, 
so far as they can be comprehended. </p>

'Jehovah appeared to Abram' means manifestation. This is clear without explanation, for, as has been stated, Abram represents the Lord. No human being at all in the whole world has seen Jehovah, the 
Lord's Father; the Lord alone has done that, as He Himself has stated in John, </p>
<blockquote>
Nobody has ever seen God; the only begotten Son who is in the bosom of the Father, He has made Him known. <a href="http://bible.gospelcom.net/cgi-bin/bible?passage=John%201:18&amp;version=ESV&amp;interface=print&amp;showfn=yes&amp;showxref">John 1:18</a>. 
</blockquote>
<p>In 
the same gospel, </p>
<blockquote>
You have never heard His voice nor seen His shape. <a href="http://bible.gospelcom.net/cgi-bin/bible?passage=John%201:37&amp;version=ESV&amp;interface=print&amp;showfn=yes&amp;showxref">John 1:37</a>. 
</blockquote>
<p>And again in the same gospel, </p>
<blockquote>
No one has seen the Father except Him who is with the Father, He has seen the 
Father. <a href="http://bible.gospelcom.net/cgi-bin/bible?passage=John%206:46&amp;version=ESV&amp;interface=print&amp;showfn=yes&amp;showxref">John 6:46</a>. 
</blockquote>

<p><b>[2]</b>
 The Infinite itself which stands above all the heavens and above man's inmost being cannot be manifested except by means of the Divine Human, which exists solely with the Lord. 
Communication of the Infinite with finite beings is not possible at all from any other source. This also explains why, when Jehovah appeared to members of the Most Ancient Church and subsequently 
to members of the Ancient Church which existed after the Flood, and also after that to Abraham and the prophets, He was manifested to them as a human being. That it was indeed the Lord, He Himself openly 
teaches in John, </p>
<blockquote>
Abraham your father rejoiced to see My day, and saw it and was glad. Truly, truly, I say to you, Before Abraham was, I am. <a href="http://bible.gospelcom.net/cgi-bin/bible?passage=John%208:56,%2058&amp;version=ESV&amp;interface=print&amp;showfn=yes&amp;showxref">John 8:56, 58</a>. 
</blockquote>
<p>This is also taught in the Prophets, 
for example in Daniel who saw Him as 'a son of man', <a href="http://bible.gospelcom.net/cgi-bin/bible?passage=Dan%207:13&amp;version=ESV&amp;interface=print&amp;showfn=yes&amp;showxref">Dan 7:13</a>. </p>
<p></p>
<p><b>[3]</b>
 From these quotations it becomes clear that the Infinite Being (Esse), which is Jehovah, could not possibly be manifested to man 
except through the Human Essence, that is, through the Lord, and so has not been manifested to anyone except the Lord alone. So that He could be present with and be joined to mankind, after mankind 
had removed itself entirely from the Divine and had immersed itself in foul desires and so in merely bodily and earthly things, He adopted the Human Essence itself by being born. He did so in order that 
the Infinite Divine could be joined to man even though man was so remote. Otherwise mankind would have died the death of those for ever damned. As for all the other arcana concerning the manifestation 
of Jehovah in the Lord's Human, when His state was a state of humiliation, before He had fully united the Human Essence to the Divine Essence and glorified it, these will in the Lord's Divine mercy 
be explained later on, to the extent that they are capable of being understood. </p>

`Apparuit Jehovah Abramo': quod significet manifestationem, constat absque explicatione, nam, ut dictum, per `Abramum' repraesentatur {1} Dominus.  Nullus hominum in universo terrarum orbe, vidit Jehovam, 
Patrem Domini, sed Dominus solus, sicut Ipse dixit apud Johannem, 	Deum nemo vidit unquam, Unigenitus Filius, qui in sinu Patris, ille exposuit, i 18: </p>
<p>apud eundem 	Neque vocem Ipsius audivistis 
unquam, neque speciem Ipsius vidistis, v 37: </p>
<p>et iterum apud eundem, 	Non quod Patrem vident quis, nisi qui apud Patrem, hic vidit Patrem, vi 46. [2]	Ipsum Infinitum quod supra omnes caelos, et 
super {2} intima apud hominem, non manifestari potest nisi per Divinum Humanum, quod solum apud Dominum; communicatio Infiniti cum finitis nusquam dabilis est aliunde; quae quoque causa est cum Jehovah 
apparuit Antiquissimae Ecclesiae hominibus, et postmodum Antiquae Ecclesia' quae post diluvium, tum dein Abrahamo et prophetis, quod manifestatus illis sicut homo, Qui quod fuerit Dominus, Ipse aperte 
docet apud Johannem, 	Abrahamus pater vester exsultavit, ut videret diem Meum, et vidit, et gavisus est:... amen, amen, dico vobis, priusquam Abrahamus fuit, Ego sum, viii 56, 58; </p>
<p>praeter apud Prophetas, 
ut apud Danielem, cui visus ut `filius hominis,' vii 13.  [3] Inde constare potest quod Infinitum Esse quod est Jehovah, nusquam manifestari potuit homini nisi per Humanum Essentiam ita nisi 
per Dominum; ac ita quod nulli manifestatum sit quam soli Domino: ut quoque adesse et conjungi potuisset homini, postquam se homo a Divino prorsus removit et foedis cupiditatibus et sic meris corporeis 
et terrestribus [se] immersit, ipsam Humanam Essentiam actualiter per nativitatem assumpsit, ut sic Infinitum Divinum, homini tam remoto usque {3} adjungere posset, alioquin periissent morte {4} damnatorum 
in aeternum.  Reliqua arcana de manifestatione Jehovae in Humano Domini, quando in statu humiliationis fuit {5}, antequam Essentiam Humanam plene univit Divinae et Ipsam glorificavit, ex Divina 
Domini Misericordia, in sequentibus, quantum ad captum, exponentur. 	@1 i et significatur.$ 	@2 supra.$ 	@3 i per ipsum Humanum.$ 	@4 i; nam removeri et abalienari a Divino est perire.  An  interesting 
deletion follows, viz., non quod usquam homo interire possit et non vivere post mortem, sed in interno esse, hoc est, damnari.$ 	@5 i hoc est.$ </p>
