<h3 align="center" class="ired">属天的奥秘 第8250节</h3>
<h4 align="center"></h4><p><strong>8250.</strong>只要人们持守诚实和正直，这种语言就会保留下来。但是，一旦心智开始想一套，说一套，当一个人爱自己，不爱邻舍时，这种事就会发生，话语所构成的语言就开始用得越来越多，然后那张脸要么一动不动，要么同时进行伪装。结果，脸的内在形式发生改变；脸萎缩、变硬，开始变得几乎没有生命；而它的外在形式则因自我之爱的火而发热，似乎充满生命。由于缺乏生命，在下面从内在充当一个基础层面的东西不再呈现在世人眼前，只呈现在天使眼前，因为天使能看见内层事物。这就是那些想一套、说一套之人的脸；因为如今构成精明的伪装、伪善、诡诈和欺骗就导致这种效果。<br />但在来世，情况就不同了；那里不允许说一套、想一套。一致性的缺乏在每句话和每个声调中都能能被清楚发觉；并且一经发现，那个缺乏这种一致性的灵人就会强行从与他人的联系中被移除，并受到惩罚。后来，就用各种方法迫使他怎样想，就怎样说，怎样意愿就怎样思想，直到他有一个不分裂的心智为止。这样做的目的是，他若是善灵，就意愿良善，并出于良善思考、谈论真理；若是恶灵，就意愿邪恶，并出于邪恶思考、谈论虚假。在此之前，善灵无法被提入天堂，恶灵也无法被投入地狱。这样做是为了地狱只有邪恶，那里的虚假是邪恶的虚假；而天堂只有良善，那里的真理是良善之真理。</p>

So long as there were sincerity and uprightness with man, so long also such speech remained; but as soon as the mind began to think one thing and speak another, which took place when man loved himself 
and not the neighbor, then the speech of words began to grow, the face being either silent or likewise counterfeiting. From this the internal form of the face was changed; it contracted itself, grew 
hard, and began to be nearly devoid of life; whereas the external form, inflamed from the fire of the love of self, seemed to be alive; but the absence of life, which is beneath, and is as a plane inwardly, 
does not appear before the eyes of men, but before the eyes of the angels, for these see the things within. Such are the faces of those who think one thing and speak another; for pretense, hypocrisy, 
cunning and deceit, which at this day are sagacity, lead to such things. But the case is otherwise in the other life, where it is not allowable to speak in one way and think in another. The dissidence 
is also clearly perceived in every word, and in every tone of the voice; and when it is perceived, the spirit in whom there is such dissidence is cast out of fellowship, and is fined. Afterward 
he is brought by various methods to speak as he thinks, and to think as he wills, until his mind is one and not divided-if he is good, to will good and to think and speak what is true from good; and 
if evil, to will evil, and to think and speak what is false from evil. The good one is not previously raised into heaven, and the evil one is not previously cast into hell; and this to the end that 
in hell there may be nothing but evil, and that the falsity there may be the falsity of evil; and that in heaven there may be nothing but good, and that the truth may be the truth of good. </p>

As long as sincerity and uprightness existed with people, so also did that kind of speech remain in existence. But as soon as the mind began to think one thing and say another, which happened when a 
person loved self and not the neighbour, speech consisting of spoken words was used more and more. The face then remained still or else at the same time had expressions on it that were counterfeit. As 
a result the face's inward form was altered, in that it shrank, hardened, and started to become virtually devoid of life; but its outward form, heated by the fire of self-love, began to appear full of 
life. But being devoid of life, what lies beneath and inwardly serves as a groundwork is not visible to men's eyes, only to angels' eyes since they see interior things. This is what the faces of people 
who think one thing and say another are like; for presence, hypocrisy, trickery, and deceit, which constitute prudence at the present day, produce such effects. </p>

 But the situation is different 
in the next life; no one is allowed there to speak in one way and think in another. That lack of agreement is also clearly perceived there in every word, and in every tone of the voice. And when it 
is perceived the spirit in whom such lack of agreement exists is forcibly removed from association with others and punished. After that he is compelled by various means to speak as he thinks, and to 
think as he wills, until his mind is single and not divided. This is done in order that, if he is a good spirit, he may will what is good and may be moved by good to think and speak what is true, or, 
if he is evil, he may will what is evil and may be moved by evil to think and speak what is false. Till then the good spirit cannot be raised to heaven or the evil one cast into hell. This is done to 
the end that in hell there may be nothing except evil, and that falsity there may be the falsity of evil, and that in heaven there may be nothing except good, and that truth there may be the truth of good. </p>

</p><b>8250.</b>
Quamdiu sincerum et rectum fuit apud hominem, tamdiu etiam talis loquela permansit, sed ut primum mens aliud cogitare coepit et aliud loqui, quod factum cum {1}homo se amavit et non proximum, tunc loquela 
vocum incrementa cepit, silente vel etiam simul mentiente facie; (s)inde interna faciei forma mutata est, contraxit se, induruit, et {2}paene vitae expers coepit fieri, at externa ex igne amoris 
sui inflammata sicut viva videri; at {3}vitae expers quod subest, et interius pro plano est, non apparet coram oculis hominum sed coram oculis angelorum, nam hi vident interiora; tales sunt facies illorum 
qui aliud cogitant et aliud loquuntur; simulatio enim, hypocrisis, astus, et dolus, quae hodierna prudentia sunt, talia inducunt.(s) 	2 Sed aliter se res habet in altera vita: ibi non licet aliter 
loqui et aliter cogitare; dissidentia etiam ibi luculenter percipitur in unaquavis voce, (c)et in unoquovis vocis sono; et cum percipitur, ejicitur spiritus in quo talis dissidentia {4}, e consortio, 
et mulctatur; {5} postea redigitur variis modis ad loquendum sicut cogitat, et ad cogitandum sicut vult, usque ut una ei mens sit et non divisa; si bonus, ut bonum velit et verum ex bono cogitet 
et loquatur; et si malus, ut malum velit et falsum ex malo cogitet et loquatur; bonus non prius in caelum elevatur, et malus nec prius in infernum conjicitur, et hoc ob finem ut in inferno non sit nisi 
quam malum, et falsum ibi sit mali; ac ut in caelo non sit nisi quam bonum, (c)ac verum ibi sit boni. 	@1 quisque$ 	@2 quasi$ 	@3 mortuus$ 	@4 i est$ 	@5 i et$ </p>
