<h3 align="center" class="ired">属天的奥秘 第805节</h3>
<h4 align="center"></h4><p><strong>805.</strong>“凡鼻孔有生命之灵气息的”表属于上古教会的人，他们“鼻孔有生命之灵的气息”，即有爱及其衍生之信的生命。这一点前面所述（<a href="96.htm">96</a>-<a href="97.htm">97</a>节）清楚可知。在上古之人中，以“鼻孔有气息”或“气息”来表示生命，就是对应于属灵事物的肉体生命，就象心脏的运动是对应于属天事物的肉体生命一样。此处经文之所以说“凡鼻孔有生命之灵气息的”，是因为所论述的主题是大洪水前的人，他们里面有遗传自其先祖、来自属天源头的种子，只是被灭绝或窒息了。<br />这些话还隐藏着更深层的意义，我们早已阐述过（<a href="97.htm">97</a>节），即：上古教会成员拥有内呼吸，因而拥有与天使一致和类似的呼吸。对此，蒙主慈悲，容后再述。这种呼吸因着内在人的各种状态而性质各异。但随着时间推移，它在其后代中逐渐发生改变，直至这最后一代，其中凡属天之物都灭亡了。这时，他们无法再与天使天堂共呼吸。这是他们灭绝的真正原因，故此处经上说他们“断了气”，“凡鼻孔有生命之灵气息的”都死了。<br />这些时代过后，内呼吸就停止了，与之同在的与天堂的交流，因而属天的直觉也停止了，外在呼吸取而代之。由于与天堂的交流就这样停止了，故古教会（或新教会）成员不再象上古教会成员那样是属天之人，而是属灵的。不过，对于这些事，蒙主慈悲，容后再述。</p>

<p><strong>[NCE]805.</strong> Everything that had the breath of living spirit in its nostrils symbolizes those who were part of the earliest church and had the breath of living spirit in their nostrils — that is, who had lived a life of love and of a faith based on love. This can be seen from what was said earlier at <a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_805/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_96" target=_top>96</a>, <a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_805/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_97" target=_top>97</a>.<br />Life was what the earliest people meant when they referred to breath in the nostrils. Breath is the vital physical force that corresponds to spiritual things, just as the beating of the heart is the vital physical force that corresponds to heavenly things.<br />The people spoken of here are the pre-Flood people who had inherited from their ancestors the rudiments of a heavenly quality (although it came to be snuffed out or smothered). That is why it says everything that had the breath of living spirit in its nostrils.<br />[2] These words also conceal an even deeper meaning, one dealt with in <a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_805/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_97" target=_top>97</a>.{*1} This deeper secret is that the people of the earliest church breathed internally, so that their breathing was harmonious with and similar to the breathing of the angels. More on this later [<a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_805/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_1118" target=_top>1118-1120</a>, <a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_805/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_3892" target=_top>3892</a>, <a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_805/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_7361" target=_top>7361</a>], with the Lord's divine mercy. Such respiration varied with all the phases their inner being went through. It changed over time in their descendants, however, up to this final generation, in whom everything angelic died out. When that happened, they forfeited their ability to breathe in unison with the angelic heaven as well. This was the real reason for their extinction, which is why it now says that they passed away and that those with the breath of living spirit in their nostrils died.<br />[3] From this time, inner breathing ceased — and along with it people's contact with heaven, and therefore the ability to intuit things in a heavenly way — and external breathing took its place. Since contact with heaven ceased in the process, the people of the ancient church (which was the new church) were no longer capable of a heavenly character, as the earliest people had been, but only a spiritual one. This will be dealt with below, though, the Lord in his divine mercy willing.{*2} <br /><strong>Footnotes:</strong><br />{*1} The breathing described in <a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_805/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_97" target=_top>97</a> is also discussed in <a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_805/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_607" target=_top>607</a>. On Swedenborg's experience of internal breathing, see note 1 in <a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_805/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_97" target=_top>97</a>. [LHC, RS]<br />{*2} For later discussion of this second church as a spiritual church, see <a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_805/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_875#subsection-2-4" target=_top>875:4</a>, <a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_805/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_916" target=_top>916</a>. In <a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_805/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_1120" target=_top>1120</a>, the change in respiration of the earliest people is more directly linked to a decline in their state of love and faith and an increase in their falsity.

All in whose nostrils was the breathing of the breath of lives. That this signifies the men who were of the Most Ancient Church in whose nostrils was the breathing of the breath of lives, that is, the 
life of love and of the derivative faith, is evident from what has been said before (n. 96, 97). Among the most ancient people, life was signified by the "breath in the nostrils" or by "breathing" which 
is the life of the body corresponding to spiritual things, as the motion of the heart is the life of the body corresponding to celestial things.  [2] It is here said, "in whose nostrils was the 
breathing of the breath of lives" because the antediluvians are treated of, in whom by inheritance from their progenitors there was seed from the celestial, but extinct or suffocated. There is also a 
deeper meaning that lies hidden in these words, of which we have already spoken (n. 97), namely, that the man of the Most Ancient Church had internal respiration, and thus respiration concordant with 
and similar to that of angels, concerning which, of the Lord's Divine mercy hereafter. This respiration was varied in accordance with all the states of the internal man. But in process of time it was 
changed in their posterity, until this last generation, wherein all that was angelic perished. Then they could no longer respire with the angelic heaven. This was the real cause of their extinction; and 
therefore it is now said that they "expired" and that they in whose nostrils was the breathing of the breath of lives, "died."  [3] After these times internal respiration ceased, and with it communication 
with heaven and thereby celestial perception, and external respiration succeeded. And because communication with heaven thus ceased, the men of the Ancient (or new) Church could no longer be 
celestial men like the Most Ancient, but were spiritual. But concerning these things, of the Lord's Divine mercy hereafter. </p>

'Everything which had the breath of the spirit of life<A name="fntext1"></a><A href="#fn1"><sup>a</sup></a> in its nostrils' means people belonging to the Most Ancient Church who had the breath of life<A name="fntext1"></a><A href="#fn1"><sup>a</sup></a> in their nostrils, that is, the life of love and 
of faith deriving from love. This is clear from what has been stated already in <a href="96.htm">96</a>, <a href="97.htm">97</a>. Life is what the most ancient people meant by 'breath in the nostrils' or breathing, which is the life of the body 
corresponding to spiritual things, just as the motion of the heart is the life of the body corresponding to celestial things. Here because the subject is the people before the Flood who from what 
they inherited from their forefathers had within them seed from a celestial origin, though that seed had been annihilated or suffocated, the statement 'everything that had the breath of the spirit of 
life<A name="fntext1"></a><A href="#fn1"><sup>a</sup></a> in its nostrils' is used. </p>
<p></p>
<p><b>[2]</b>
 These words also conceal something quite deeply hidden, which has been dealt with already in <a href="97.htm">97</a>. It is this: The member of the Most Ancient Church possessed internal 
breathing, and so possessed breathing that accorded with and was similar to the breathing of angels, which will in the Lord's Divine mercy be described later on. The nature of that breathing varied 
according to every one of the states of the internal man; but it was altered in the process of time among their descendants down to this final generation of them in whom everything angelic perished. 
At that point they were no longer capable of breathing in company with the angelic heaven. This was the real reason for their annihilation, and why it is now said that 'they breathed their last' and 
that 'they died in whom there was the breath of the spirit of life<A name="fntext1"></a><A href="#fn1"><sup>a</sup></a> in their nostrils'. After those times internal breathing came to an end, and with it communication with heaven, and consequently celestial 
perception; and external breathing took its place. And since communication with heaven came to an end in this way, members of the Ancient or new Church were no longer capable of being celestial 
men, as the most ancient people had been, but spiritual. These matters however will in the Lord's Divine mercy be dealt with later on.

'Omne cui flatus spiritus vitarum in naribus ejus': quod significent illos qui ab Antiquissima Ecclesia, quibus flatus vitarum in naribus, hoc est, vita amoris et fidei inde, fuerat, constat ab illis 
quae prius, n. 96, 97, dicta sunt.  Vita ab antiquissimis significata fuit per 'flatum in naribus,' seu per respirationem, quae est vita corporis correspondens spiritualibus; sicut motus cordis est 
vita corporis correspondens caelestibus: hic quia agitur de antediluvianis, in quibus fuit a parentibus hereditario semen ex caelesti, sed exstinctum seu suffocatum, hic dicitur 'omne cui flatus spiritus 
vitarum in naribus ejus': [2] in his verbis quoque altius quid reconditum latet, de quo prius, n. 97, quod nempe Antiquissimae Ecclesiae homo respirationem internam habuerit, ita concordem et similem 
cum respiratione angelorum, de qua, ex Divina Domini Misericordia, in sequentibus; quae respiratio variata fuit secundum omnes status interni hominis; sed successu temporis in posteris mutata usque 
ad primam hanc posteritatem, in qua omne angelicum periit; tunc nec amplius cum caelo angelico respirare potuerunt; quae causa genuina exstinctionis eorum fuit, inde nunc dicitur quod 'exspiraverint' 
et quod 'mortui sint, quibus flatus spiritus vitarum in naribus.' Post haec tempora cessavit respiratio interna, et cum illa communicatio cum caelo, ita perceptio caelestis, et successit externa; et 
quia sic communicatio cum caelo cessavit, homines Antiquae seu novae Ecclesiae non amplius potuerunt caelestes homines esse, sicut antiquissimi, sed spirituales sed de his, ex Divina Domini Misericordia, 
in sequentibus. </p>
