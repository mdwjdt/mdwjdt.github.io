<h3 align="center" class="ired">属天的奥秘 第7231节</h3>
<h4 align="center"></h4><p><strong>7231.</strong>由于这几节只是些名字，故没有必要详细解释它们；特别是前面已经说明流便、西缅、利未、亚伦和摩西代表什么；此处提到名字的他们的儿孙只是他们所代表的那些事物衍生的后代。“流便”代表理解力中的信（参看<a href="3861.htm">3861</a>，<a href="3866.htm">3866</a>，<a href="4731.htm">4731</a>，<a href="4734.htm">4734</a>，<a href="4761.htm">4761</a>节）；“西缅”代表意愿和行为中的信（<a href="3769.htm">3769</a>-<a href="3872.htm">3872</a>，<a href="4497.htm">4497</a>，<a href="4502.htm">4502</a>，<a href="4503.htm">4503</a>，<a href="5482.htm">5482</a>，<a href="5626.htm">5626</a>，<a href="5630.htm">5630</a>节）；“利未”代表仁（<a href="3875.htm">3875</a>，<a href="3877.htm">3877</a>，<a href="4497.htm">4497</a>，<a href="4502.htm">4502</a>，<a href="4503.htm">4503</a>节）；“亚伦”代表教会的教义（<a href="6998.htm">6998</a>，<a href="7009.htm">7009</a>，<a href="7089.htm">7089</a>节）；“摩西”代表从神来的律法（<a href="6771.htm">6771</a>，<a href="6827.htm">6827</a>节）。此处提及流便、西缅、利未及其儿孙，没有依次提及其余支派的父系及其儿孙；其原因若不通过内义，就无法得知。显然，本章列举这些名字是为了让人们了解亚伦和摩西的出身和出生。然而，利未的家谱就足以说明这一点，因为流便、西缅及其儿孙无助于此。但提及这些人的原因只能从内义看出来，这原因就是所论述的主题是“以色列人”所代表的属灵教会。<br />这教会通过存在于一个人所知道的事里面，然后存在于他的理解力里面的信而在他那里产生；这种信由流便，后来由他的儿孙来代表。此后，当教会在人那里成长时，这信就进入他的意愿，并从他的意愿进入行为。这时，此人便拥有信之真理在自己的意愿里面，并将它付诸实践，因为它是圣言所吩咐的。信的这一阶段由“西缅”来代表；最后，在他的意愿，也就是他的新意愿里面，仁爱的情感是可感知的，以致他不像以前那样出于信仰，而是出于对邻之仁而愿意行善。事实上，当人重生到这种程度时，他就是属灵教会的一个成员，因为现在教会在他里面。这仁爱及其情感就是利未所代表的。这解释了为何经上列举了流便，以及西缅的各家，最后提到利未的家室；如前所述，利未代表仁爱，而仁爱是教会的属灵品质。“亚伦”代表该教会的外在，“摩西”代表内在。教会的内在被称为从神来的律法，外在被称为源于它的教义。从神来的律法，就是教会的内在，也是内在意义上的圣言；源于它的教义是外在意义上的圣言。因为摩西和亚伦代表这些（参看<a href="7089.htm">7089</a>节）。</p>

As these are mere names it is needless to unfold them in detail; and besides it has been already shown what is represented by Reuben, Simeon, Levi, Aaron, and Moses; their sons and grandsons, who are 
here named, being merely the derivations therefrom. (That Reuben represents faith in the understanding, see n. 3861, 3866, 4731, 4734, 4761; that Simeon represents faith in the will and in act, n. 3769-3872, 
4497, 4502, 4503, 5482, 5626, 5630; Levi, charity, n. 3875, 3877, 4497, 4502, 4503; Aaron, the doctrine of the church, n. 6998, 7009, 7089; and Moses, the law from the Divine, n. 6771, 6827.) 
The reason why mention is here made of Reuben, Simeon, Levi, and their sons, and not the rest of the fathers of the tribes with their sons in order, cannot be known except from the internal sense. That 
this enumeration was made in this chapter to make known the nativity of Aaron and Moses is evident; but for this the genealogy of Levi would have sufficed, for the genealogy of Reuben, Simeon, and 
their sons contributes nothing thereto. But the reason (which is seen from the internal sense alone) is that the subject treated of is the spiritual church, which is represented by the sons of Israel, 
which church begins with man by means of faith in knowledge and next in understanding, which faith is represented by Reuben and his sons afterward, when the church grows with man, this faith passes into 
the will, and from the will into act, and then the man wills the truth which is of faith and does it because it has been so commanded in the Word; this stage of faith is represented by Simeon; lastly, 
in his will, which is new, there is perceived the affection of charity, so that he wills to do what is good, not as before from faith, but from charity toward the neighbor; for when the man is being 
regenerated thus far, he is then a man of the spiritual church, for the church is then in him; this charity with its affection is what is represented by Levi. Hence then it is that the families of 
Reuben and also of Simeon are enumerated, and lastly the family of Levi, by whom as before said is represented charity, which is the very spiritual of the church. Aaron represents the external of this 
church, and Moses the internal; the internal of the church is called the law from the Divine, and the external is called the derivative doctrine. The law from the divine, which is the internal of the 
church, is also the Word in the internal sense; and the derivative doctrine is the Word in the external sense. (That these are represented by Moses and Aaron, see n. 7089.) </p>

Since these verses consist of mere names detailed explanation can be dispensed with, especially as it has been shown already what Reuben, Simeon, Levi, Aaron, and Moses represent, and their sons and 
grandsons who are named here are simply further generations descending from those things they represent.  </p>

<p>The reason why Reuben, Simeon, Levi and their sons are mentioned here, and not the remaining fathers of 
the tribes together with their sons in their proper order, cannot be known except from the internal sense. One can see that the list of names has been provided in this chapter to make known the matter 
of Aaron and Moses' parentage and birth. Yet the genealogy of Levi would have been sufficient to do this, for nothing whatever about Reuben and Simeon, or about their sons, helps to make that matter 
known. But the reason why these are mentioned, which is evident only from the internal sense, is that the spiritual Church, which is represented by 'the children of Israel', is the subject.  </p>
<p></p>
<p><b>[2]</b>
That Church is brought into being with a person through faith present within what he knows and then within his understanding, the kind of faith that is represented by 'Reuben and his sons'. After this, 
when the Church with the person grows, that faith passes into his will, and from will into action. At this point the person has the truth of faith in his will and puts it into practice because it is 
what has been commanded in the Word. This phase of faith is represented by 'Simeon'. Finally within his will, that is, his new will, an affection characteristic of charity is perceptible, so that his 
wish to do what is good is motivated not by faith, as it was previously, but by charity towards the neighbour. For when a person's regeneration has come that far he is a member of the spiritual Church, 
since he now has that Church within him. This charity and the affection belonging to it is what' Levi' represents. </p>
<p>This then explains why the families of Reuben and also of Simeon are listed, and 
finally the family of Levi, who, as has been stated, represents charity, which is what gives the Church its spiritual character. 'Aaron' represents the external dimension of that Church, and 'Moses' 
the internal dimension. The internal dimension of the Church is referred to as the law from God, the external dimension as teachings derived from it. The law from God - the internal dimension of the 
Church - is also the Word in its internal sense, and the teachings derived from it are the Word in its external sense. For Moses and Aaron's representation of these, see <a href="7089.htm">7089</a>. </p>

Haec quia mera nomina sunt, singillatim explicare supersedetur, ex causa etiam quia prius ostensum est quid per (x)Rubenem, Schimeonem, Levin, Aharonem, et Moschen, repraesentatur; sunt filii illorum 
ac nepotes, qui hic {1} nominantur, non aliud quam derivationes; quod (x)`Ruben' repraesentet fidem intellectu, videatur n. 3861, 3866, 4731, 4734, 4761; quod `Schimeon' repraesentet fidem voluntate 
et actu, n. 3869-3872, 4497, 4502, 4503, 5482, 5626, 5630; quod `Levi' charitatem, n. 3875, 3877, 4497, 4502, 4503; quod `Aharon' doctrinam {2}Ecclesiae, n. 6998, 7009, 7089; et quod `Moscheh' legem 
a Divino, n. 6771, 6827.  Cur hic memorantur Ruben, Schimeon, et Levi, et eorum filii, et non reliqui patres tribuum cum suis filiis in suo ordine, non sciri potest nisi ex sensu interno; quod recensio 
illa in hoc capite facta sit ut sciretur nativitas Aharonis et Moschis, patet, sed ad illam satis fuisset genealogia Levi, nam ad illam nihil quicquam conducit Rubenis et Schimeonis, nec filiorum illorum; 
sed causa quae ex sensu interno solum patet, est quia agitur de Ecclesia spirituali, quae per `filios Israelis' repraesentatur; quae Ecclesia apud 2 hominem incipit per fidem scientia et dein intellectu, 
quae repraesentatur per `Rubenem et ejus filios'; postea cum `Ecclesia apud hominem crescit', transit fides illa in voluntatem et a voluntate in actum, et tunc homo vult verum quod fidei, et 
facit illud, quia ita mandatum est in Verbo; {4}hoc fidei repraesentatur per `Schimeonem'; {5} demum in voluntate ejus {6}quae nova, appercipitur charitatis affectio, ut velit bonum facere, non ut prius 
ex fide, sed ex charitate erga proximum; cum enim homo eo usque regeneratur, tunc est homo Ecclesiae spiritualis, nam in {7}illo tunc est {8} Ecclesia; charitas haec {9}cum sua affectione est quae 
repraesentatur per `Levin'; inde nunc est quod familiae Rubenis et quoque Schimeonis recenseantur, et demum familia Levi, per quem repraesentatur, ut dictum est, charitas, quae est ipsum spirituale 
Ecclesiae; Aharon repraesentat externum illius Ecclesiae, et Moscheh internum; internum Ecclesiae vocatur lex a Divino, et externum doctrina inde; lex a Divino, quae est internum Ecclesiae, est quoque 
Verbum in sensu interno; et doctrina inde est Verbum in sensu externo; quod illa per Moschen et Aharonem repraesententur, videatur n. 7089. 	@1 i quoque$ 	@2 boni et veri$ 	@3 homo crescit illa fide$ 	@4
