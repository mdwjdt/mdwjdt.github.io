Verses 25-27. And Joseph said unto Pharaoh, The dream of Pharaoh is one; what God doeth He hath shown to Pharaoh. The seven good kine are seven years, and the seven good ears are seven years; the dream 
is one. And the seven thin and evil kine that came up after them are seven years, and the seven empty ears parched with the east wind shall be seven years of famine. "And Joseph said unto Pharaoh," 
signifies the perception of the natural from the celestial of the spiritual; "the dream of Pharaoh is one," signifies the like in both, foreseen; "what God doeth He hath shown to Pharaoh," signifies 
what was provided, that it was given the natural to perceive; "the seven good kine are seven years," signifies states of the multiplication of truth in the interior natural; "and the seven good ears are 
seven years," signifies states of the multiplication of truth in the exterior natural; "the dream is one," signifies that there will be both by conjunction; "and the seven thin and evil kine that came 
up after them are seven years," signifies states of the multiplication of falsity that infests the interior natural; "and the seven empty ears parched with the east wind," signifies states of the 
multiplication of falsity that infests the exterior natural; "shall be seven years of famine," signifies hence a lack and seeming privation of truth. </p>

Verses 25-27 And Joseph said to Pharaoh, Pharaoh's dream, it is one; what God is doing He has pointed out to Pharaoh. The seven good cows are seven years, and the seven good heads of grain are seven 
years; the dream, it is one. And the seven thin and bad cows coming up after them are seven years; and the seven empty heads of grain, scorched by an east wind, will be seven years of famine.  </p>
<p>'And 
Joseph said to Pharaoh' means a perception which the natural received from the celestial of the spiritual. 'Pharaoh's dream, it is one' means that a similar situation existed in both parts, which was 
foreseen. 'What God is doing He has pointed out to Pharaoh' means that the natural was allowed to discern what was provided. 'The seven good cows are seven years' means a state when truth within the 
interior natural is multiplied. 'And the seven good heads of grain are seven years' means a state when truth within the exterior natural is multiplied. 'The dream, it is one' means that both will be such 
through a joining together. 'And the seven thin and bad cows coming up after them are seven years' means a state when falsity attacking the interior natural is multiplied. 'And the seven empty heads 
of grain, scorched by an east wind' means a state when falsity attacking the exterior natural is multiplied. 'Will be seven years of famine' means a consequent absence and seeming deprivation of truth. </p>

Vers. 25-27.  Et dixit Joseph ad Pharaonem, Somnium Pharaonis unum illud, quod Deus faciens indicavit Pharaoni. Septem vaccae bonae septem anni eae, et septem aristae bonae septem anni illae; somnium 
unum illud. Et septem vaccae graciles et malae ascendentes post eas, septem anni eae; et septem aristae vacuae, exustae euro, erunt septem anni famis. `Et dixit Joseph ad Pharaonem' significat perceptionem 
naturalis e caelesti spiritualis: `somnium Pharaonis unum illud' significat simile in utroque {1}quod praevisum: `quod Deus faciens indicavit Pharaoni' significat quid {2}provisum quod appercipere 
datum naturali: `septem vaccae bonae septem anni eae' significat status multiplicationis veri in interiore naturali: `et septem aristae bonae septem anni illae' significat status multiplicationis 
veri in exteriore naturali: `somnium unum illud' significat quod utrumque erit per conjunctionem: `et septem vaccae graciles et malae ascendentes post eas, septem anni eae' significat status multiplicationis 
falsi infestantis interius naturale: `et septem aristae vacuae, exustae euro' significat status multiplicationis falsi infestantis exterius naturale: `erunt septem anni famis' significat inde 
defectum et privationem veri apparentem.  @1 quoad I$ @2 praevisum I$ </p>
