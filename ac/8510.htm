<h3 align="center" class="ired">属天的奥秘 第8510节</h3>
<h4 align="center"></h4><p><strong>8510.</strong>“百姓中有人出去收集，什么也找不着”表他们想要获得它，但这是不可能的。这从前面的解释（<a href="8505.htm">8505</a>节）清楚可知。那里的解释清楚表明什么是源于信之真理的行为，什么是源于仁之良善的行为，即：出于信之真理行事的人还没有天堂的秩序在自己里面，而出于仁之良善行事的人则有这种秩序。事实上，当主引导人时，祂照着秩序通过此人的意愿，因而通过良善引导他，因为这良善完全属于意愿。在这种情况下，他的理解力是从属的，真理也是从属的，因为这真理完全属于理解力。当这种状态存在时，就是“安息日”；因为这时，主就安歇了；当良善与真理结合时，这种状态就会出现。这种状态是主的安歇，这一点从以下事实可以看出来：耶和华或主，在六日的创造和劳碌之后，在第七天歇了祂一切的工（创世记<a href="http://39-27.cn/创2.2.htm">2:2</a>）。这种状态就是天堂的状态；这解释了为何天堂被称为安息日，在天堂有一个永恒的安息日。创世记第一章的创世故事表示一个新造或重生，在这一章，六日表示试探和争战（参看创世记1、2章的解释）。</p>

There went out some of the people for to gather, and they found none. That this signifies that they desired to acquire, but it was not possible, is evident from what was unfolded above (n. 8505). It 
is there made plain what it is to act from the truth which is of faith, and what from the good which is of charity, namely, that he who acts from the truth which is of faith is not yet in the order of 
heaven, but that he who acts from the good which is of charity is in this order. For the order in which man is led by the Lord is by man's willing, consequently by means of good, for this is of the will, 
and then his understanding ministers, consequently truth, for this is of the understanding. When this state is attained, then is "the Sabbath;" for then the Lord has rest; this state comes forth 
when good has been conjoined with truth. That this state is the Lord's "rest," can be seen from the fact that Jehovah, or the Lord, after the creation and labor of six days, on the seventh day rested 
from all His work (Gen. 2:2). This state is the state of heaven; consequently heaven itself is called a "Sabbath," or in heaven there is said to be a "perpetual Sabbath." That by the creation in the first 
chapter of Genesis is meant a new creation or regeneration, and that by the six days in that chapter are meant temptations and combats, see what has been unfolded at chapters 1 and 2. </p>

<p align="center"><b>Elliott(1983-1999) 8510</b></p><p><b>8510.</b>
'That some of the people went out to gather, and did not find' means that they wished to acquire it, but none was given. This is clear from the explanation above in <a href="8505.htm">8505</a>. The explanation there shows 
what actions springing from the truth of faith are and what those springing from the good of charity are. That is to say, it shows that a person whose actions spring from the truth of faith does not as 
yet have the order of heaven present in himself, whereas one whose actions spring from the good of charity does have it. For, according to order, when the Lord leads a person He does so through his 
will, consequently through good since this belongs properly to the will. In that case his understanding is subservient, and so is truth since this belongs properly to the understanding. When this state 
exists it is the sabbath, for then there is rest for the Lord; and the state comes into being once good has been joined to truth. That this state is the Lord's rest may be recognized from the statement 
that after six days of creation and labour Jehovah or the Lord rested on the seventh day from all His work, <a href="http://bible.gospelcom.net/cgi-bin/bible?passage=Gen%202:2&amp;version=ESV&amp;interface=print&amp;showfn=yes&amp;showxref">Gen 2:2</a>. This state is heaven's state, which explains why heaven itself is called the sabbath, 
and that in heaven the sabbath is perpetual. For the creation story in Genesis <a href="1.htm">1</a> serves to mean the new creation, which is regeneration, and the six days in the story serves to mean temptations 
and conflicts, see the explanations at Genesis <a href="1.htm">1</a> and <a href="2.htm">2</a>. </p>

`Exiverunt e populo ad colligendum, et non invenerunt': quod significet quod acquirere vellent, sed non datum, constat {1} ex illis quae supra n. 8505 explicata sunt; ibi patet quid sit ex vero quod 
fidei agere, et quid ex bono quod charitatis, quod nempe qui agit ex vero quod fidei nondum in ordine caeli sit, sed qui agit ex bono quod charitatis in ordine sit; ordo enim quo ducitur homo a Domino 
est per velle hominis, consequenter per bonum, nam hoc est voluntatis; tunc intelligere ejus inservit, consequenter verum, nam hoc est intellectus.  Cum hic status est, tunc sabbatum est, nam tunc quies 
Domino; ille status existit cum conjunctum bonum est vero; quod ille status sit quies Domini, constare potest ex eo quod Jehovah seu Dominus post sex dierum creationem et laborem die septimo {2}requieverit 
ab omni opere, Gen. ii 2; hic status est status caeli, inde est quod ipsum caelum dicatur sabbatum, seu in caelo perpetuum sit sabbatum; quod per creationem {3}in Gen. i intelligatur nova creatio 
seu regeneratio, et per sex dies ibi tentationes et pugnae, videantur quae ad cap. i et ii {4}ibi explicata sunt. 	@1 i etiam$ 	@2 quieverit$ 	@3 ibi$ 	@4 Genes.$ </p>
