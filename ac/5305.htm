<h3 align="center" class="ired">属天的奥秘 第5305节</h3>
<h4 align="center"></h4><p><strong>5305.</strong>“和他众臣仆眼里（都为好）”表属世层中的一切事物都非常满意。这从“这话在他们眼里都为好”和“仆人”的含义清楚可知：“这话在他们眼里都为好”是指非常满意的感觉，如刚才所述（<a href="5304.htm">5304</a>节）；“仆人”是指属世层中的事物，尤其外层属世层中的事物。“仆人”这个词出现在圣言的各个地方。就内义而言，它表示服务某种其它事物之物，一般表示相对于上面的事物来说，在下面的一切事物。因为按照次序，低层事物要服务于高层事物；并且低层事物越进行服务，就越被称为“仆人”。然而，在目前的语境中，被称为“仆人”的，是属世层里面的事物，属世层一般由“法老”来代表。总的或共同的整体必通过它的个体或具体部分来进行服务，正如无论在哪个国家，公共利益都是由它的个体臣民来服务的。“法老”代表总体上的属世层（参看<a href="5160.htm">5160</a>节）。</p>

And in the eyes of all his servants. That this signifies what is very pleasing to all things in the natural, is evident from the signification of the "word being good in their eyes," as being what is 
very pleasing (of which just above, n. 5304); and from the signification of "servants," as being the things in the natural, especially in the exterior natural. A "servant" is occasionally mentioned in 
the Word, and thereby in the internal sense is meant that which is of service to something else, and in general all that which is below relatively to what is above; for it is in accordance with order 
that the lower should be of service to the higher, and insofar as it is of service it is called a "servant." In the present case it is the things in the natural that are called "servants;" for the natural 
in general is represented by Pharaoh, and the general itself is that to which the particulars are to be of service, as to the common good in kingdoms. (That "Pharaoh" is the natural in general, 
may be seen above, n. 5160.) </p>

<p align="center"><b>Elliott(1983-1999) 5305</b></p><p><b>5305.</b>
'And in the eyes of all his servants' means that everything in the natural was well-pleased. This is clear from the meaning of 'the thing being good in the eyes of' as a well-pleased feeling, dealt with 
immediately above in <a href="5304.htm">5304</a>; and from the meaning of 'servants' as what was in the natural, especially in the exterior natural. The word 'servant' occurs in places throughout the Word. In the internal 
sense it means that which is of service to another; and in general it means everything that is lower when considered in relation to what is above it. For order requires what is lower to serve what 
is higher; and insofar as it actually does so it is called 'a servant'. In the present context however things within the natural are being called 'servants', the natural in general being represented by 
'Pharaoh'. The general or common whole has to be served by its individual parts, in the same way as the common good is served in any kingdom by its individual subjects. As regards 'Pharaoh' representing 
the natural in general, see <a href="5160.htm">5160</a>. </p>

<p align="center"><b>Latin(1748-1756) 5305</b>
</p><b>5305.</b>
`Et in oculis omnium servorum illius': quod significet complacentiam omnibus in naturali, constat ex significatione `{1}bonum esse verbum in oculis' quod sit complacentia, de qua mox supra n. 5304; 
et ex significatione `servorum' quod sint illa quae in naturali sunt, imprimis quae {2} in naturali exteriore; in Verbo passim dicitur 'servus', et per illum in sensu interno intelligitur id quod inservit 
alteri, in genere omne quod infra est respective ad illud quod supra, nam ex ordine est ut {3}inferius inserviat superiori, et quatenus inservit, vocatur `servus'; hic autem sunt illa quae in naturali, 
quae vocantur `servi'; est enim naturale in communi quod repraesentatur per `Pharaonem'; ipsum commune est cui singula inservitura sunt, sicut communi bono in regnis; quod `Pharaoh' sit naturale 
in communi, videatur n. 5160.   @1 in oculis, nempe quod bonum fuit verbum$ @2 i sunt$ @3 A had this but altered to illud inserviat huic$ </p>
