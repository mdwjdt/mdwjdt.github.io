<h3 align="center" class="ired">属天的奥秘 第3128节</h3>
<h4 align="center"></h4><p><strong>3128.</strong>“把这些话告诉她母亲家里的人”表对着启示所能抵达的各种属世之善。这从“母亲家”的含义清楚可知，“母亲家”是指外在人的良善，也就是属世之善。“家”（house）表良善（参看<a href="2233.htm">2233</a>，<a href="2234.htm">2234</a>，<a href="2559.htm">2559</a>节）；人的外在或属世层来自母亲，而人的内在来自父亲（参看<a href="1815.htm">1815</a>节）。在圣言中，人所具有的良善好比一个“家” ，因此由良善所主导的人被称为“神之家”。不过，内在良善被称为“父家”，同等程度的良善被称为“兄弟家”，而与属世之善一样的外在良善则被称为“母亲家”。此外，一切良善与真理皆以这种方式生出，也就是说，通过如同父亲的内在良善进入如同母亲的外在良善的流注生出。<br />由于本节论述的主题是那要与良善在理性中联结的真理的起源，故经上说，代表那真理的利百加“跑到她母亲家”，因为这是真理的发源地。正如前面所阐述和说明的，一切良善经由内在途径，即经由灵魂流入人的理性，并通过理性流入他的事实知识，甚至流入感官意识，在那里凭启示使真理显为可见。真理从那里被召唤出来，并脱去它们的属世形式，在中途，也就是在理性中与良善联结，同时构成理性人，最终构成属灵人。然而，人全然不知这些事如何成就，因为如今几乎没人知道何为良善，并且良善不同于真理；更不知道人凭良善进入真理的流、通过这二者的联结被改造；也不知道理性人不同于属世人。既然这些最一般的事都不为人所知，那么真理如何被引入良善，以及这二者的联结如何实现，也就绝无可能为人所知，而这些事便是本章内义所论述的主题。如今，这些奥秘已被揭开，并呈现给凡由良善所主导的任何人，也就是具有天使心智的人。这类奥秘在其他人看来无论显得多么模糊，都必须被阐述清楚，因为它们就在内义中。<br />关于属世人中经由真理出自良善、在此被称为“母亲家”的启示，情况是这样：与人同在的神圣良善流入他的理性人，并通过理性人流入他的属世人，甚至流入他的记忆知识或事实知识，也就是流入认知和那里的教义，如前所述。然后，通过使那里的真理适应自己，所流入的良善为自己使真理成形，并藉由它们启示属世人中的一切事物。但是，如果属世人的生命具有这样的性质，即它不接受神圣良善，而是要么弃绝、要么败坏、要么窒息它，那么神圣良善就无法使真理适应自己，从而为自己使它们成形。结果，属世人无法被启示，因为属世人中的启示经由真理通过良善实现。那里不再有启示，也就不再有改造。这就是为何内义也大量论述属世人，包括它的性质，真理的起源，也就是它由那里的良善产生的原因。</p>

And told her mother's house according to these words. That this signifies toward natural good of every kind whithersoever enlightenment could reach, is evident from the signification of the "mother's 
house," as being the good of the external man, that is, natural good. (That a "house" denotes good may be seen above, n. 2233, 2234, 2559; also that man's external or natural is from the mother, but 
the internal from the father, n. 1815.) The good with man is compared in the Word to a "house," and on this account a man who is in good is called a "house of God;" but internal good is called the "father's 
house," and the good that is in the same degree is called the "house of the brethren;" but external good, which is the same as natural good, is called the "mother's house." Moreover all good and 
truth are born in this manner, namely, by the influx of internal good as of a father into external good as of a mother.  [2] As this verse treats of the origin of the truth which is to be conjoined 
with good in the rational, it is therefore said that Rebekah (by whom this truth is represented) ran to the house of her mother, for that was the origin of this truth. For as before said and shown, all 
good flows in by an internal way (that is, by the way of the soul) into man's rational, and through this into his faculty of knowing, even into that which is of the senses; and by enlightenment there 
it causes truths to be seen. Truths are called forth thence, and are divested of their natural form, and are conjoined with good in the midway, that is, in the rational, and at the same time they make 
the man rational, and at last spiritual. But how these things are accomplished is utterly unknown to man; because at this day it is scarcely known what good is, and that it is distinct from truth; 
still less that man is reformed by means of the influx of good into truth, and by the conjunction of the two; neither is it known that the rational is distinct from the natural. And when these things, 
which are most general, are not known, it cannot possibly be known how the initiation of truth into good, and the conjunction of the two, is effected-which are the subjects treated of in this chapter 
in its internal sense. But whereas these arcana have been revealed, and are manifest to those who are in good, that is, who are angelic minds, therefore however obscure they may appear to others, they 
nevertheless are to be set forth, because they are in the internal sense.  [3] Concerning the enlightenment from good through truth in the natural man, which is here called the "mother's house," the 
case is this: Divine good with man inflows into his rational, and through the rational into his natural, and indeed into its memory-knowledges, that is, into the knowledges and doctrinal things therein, 
as before said; and there by a fitting of itself in, it forms truths for itself, through which it then enlightens all things that are in the natural man. But if the life of the natural man is such 
that it does not receive the Divine good, but either repels it, or perverts it, or suffocates it, then the Divine good cannot be fitted in, thus it cannot form for itself truths; and consequently the 
natural can no longer be enlightened; for enlightenment in the natural man is effected from good through truths; and when there is no longer enlightenment, there can be no reformation. This is the 
reason why in the internal sense the natural man also is much treated of in regard to its quality; thus whence truth is, namely, that it is from good there. </p>

<p align="center"><b>Elliott(1983-1999) 3128</b></p><p><b>3128.</b>
'And told [those of] her mother's house all about these things' means towards whatever natural good enlightenment was able to reach. This is clear from the meaning of 'mother's house' as the good of 
the external man, that is, natural good. For 'a house' means good, see <a href="2233.htm">2233</a>, <a href="2234.htm">2234</a>,<A name="fntext1"></a><A href="#fn1"><sup>a</sup></a> <a href="2559.htm">2559</a>; and man's external or natural is received from the mother, but his internal from the father, <a href="1815.htm">1815</a>. In the Word 
the good that exists with a person is compared to 'a house', and for that reason one who is governed by good is called 'the House of God'. But internal good is called one's 'father's house', while good 
of an identical degree is spoken of as one's 'brethren's house', and external good, which is the same as natural good, is referred to as one's 'mother's house'. Furthermore all good and truth is born 
in this fashion, that is to say, by means of the influx of internal good as the father into external good as the mother.  </p>
<p></p>
<p><b>[2]</b>
 Since the subject in this verse is the origin of truth that was to be 
joined to good in the Rational it is therefore said that Rebekah, who represents that truth, 'ran to her mother's house', for this is where truth originates. As stated and shown above, all good flows 
in by an internal route, that is, by way of the soul, into man's rational, and through the rational into his factual knowledge, and even into his sensory awareness, and by means of enlightenment there 
causes truths to be seen. From there truths are summoned, stripped of the natural form they possess, and joined to good in the mid-way position, that is to say, in the rational, and together constitute 
the rational man, and at length the spiritual man. How all this is effected however is quite unknown to anyone, for at the present day scarcely any knowledge exists of what good is or of its being 
distinct and separate from truth. Still less does anyone know that a person is reformed by means of the influx of good into truth and by the joining together of the two. Nor is it known that the rational 
is distinct and separate from the natural. And since these matters which are very general are unknown, it cannot possibly be known how truth is introduced into good, and how the joining together 
of these two is effected - which are the things dealt with in this chapter in the internal sense. Now seeing that these arcana have been revealed and are open to view to any who are governed by good, 
that is, who have minds like those of angels, such arcana, no matter how obscure they may appear to others, must be explained since they are in the internal sense. </p>
<p></p>
<p><b>[3]</b>
 Regarding that enlightenment, 
which comes from good by way of truth in the natural man, here called 'the mother's house', the position is that Divine Good with man flows into his rational, and through the rational into his natural, 
and even into his factual knowledge, that is, into the cognitions and matters of doctrine there, as has been stated. Then by fitting the truths there to itself, inflowing Divine Good shapes them for 
itself, and by means of them enlightens everything in the natural man. But if the life of the natural man is such that it does not receive Divine Good, but either rejects, or perverts, or stifles it, 
Divine Good cannot fit truths to itself and so shape them for itself. As a consequence the natural cannot be enlightened any longer, for enlightenment in the natural man is effected by good through 
truths; and when there is no longer any enlightenment no reformation can take place. This is the reason why in the internal sense also so much reference is made to the nature of the natural man, and 
so to the origin of truth, namely that it arises from the good there.

`Et indicabat domui matris suae juxta verba illa': quod significet ad bonum quodcumque naturale quo illustratio pervenire potuit, constat ex significatione `domus matris' quod sit bonum externi hominis, 
hoc est, bonum naturale; quod `domus' sit bonum, videatur n. 2233, 2234, 2559; et quod (t)externum hominis seu naturale sit ex matre, internum autem ex patre, n. 1815; `bonum apud hominem in Verbo 
comparatur `domui,' ac propterea homo qui in bono, vocatur `domus Dei'; sed bonum internum vocatur `domus patris,' bonum autem quod in eodem gradu est, dicitur `domus fratrum,' at bonum externum, quod 
idem est ac naturale, appellatur `domus matris'; omne etiam bonum et verum ita nascitur, nempe per influxum boni interni ut patris, in bonum externum ut matris: [2] quia in hoc versu de origine veri 
quod conjungendum bono in rationali, agitur, ideo dicitur quod Rebecca per quam illud verum repraesentatur, `cucurrerit ad domum matris,' inde enim origo veri; nam ut supra dictum et ostensum, omne 
bonum influit per viam internam seu per viam animae in hominis rationale, et per id in ejus scientificum, usque i scientificum sensuale, et per illustrationem ibi facit ut videantur vera, inde vera evocantur, 
et forma naturali exuuntur,  et bono conjunguntur in media via, nempe in rationali, et simul faciunt hominem rationalem, et tandem spiritualem: sed quomodo haec fiunt, homini prorsus ignotum 
est, quoniam hodie vix scitur quid bonum, et quod distinctum a vero, minus quod reformetur homo per influxum boni in verum et per utriusque conjunctionem; nec scitur quod rationale sit distinctum a naturali; 
cum haec, quae communissima sunt, ignorantur, nequicquam sciri potest quomodo initiatio veri in bonum, et utriusque conjunctio fit, de quibus in sensu interno in hoc capite agitur; at quia haec 
arcana revelata sunt, ac patent illis qui in bono sunt, hoc est, qui angelicae mentes sunt, ideo utcumque aliis obscura apparitura sint, usque arcana illa quia in sensu interno sunt, exponenda erunt. 
[3] De illustratione a bono per verum in homine naturali, qui hic `domus matris' dicitur, ita se habet: Divinum Bonum apud hominem influit in ejus rationale, et per rationale in ejus naturale, et quidem 
in ejus scientifica, seu cognitiones et doctrinalia ibi, ut dictum est, ac ibi per inaptationem format sibi vera, per quae tunc illustrat omnia quae in naturali homine sunt; at si vita naturalis 
hominis talis est ut non recipiat Divinum Bonum, sed id vel repellit, vel pervertit, vel suffocat, tunc Divinum Bonum {1}non inaptari potest, ita nec formare sibi vera, inde nec amplius illustrari potest 
naturale, nam illustratio in naturali homine fit a bono per vera, et cum nulla amplius illustratio, nulla potest dari reformatio: haec causa est quod in sensu interno {2}multis quoque agatur de naturali 
homine, qualis {3}sit, ita unde verum, quod nempe ex bono ibi. @1 i ibi$ @2 multum$  @3 esset$  </p>
