<h3 align="center" class="ired">属天的奥秘 第445节</h3>
<h4 align="center"></h4><p><strong>445.</strong>我还被告知，饱学之士认定死后存活的灵魂或灵只是抽象的思想。这从他们拒绝接受暗示维度的术语和具有维度性质的事物明显看出来，因为从主体当中抽离出来的思想是没有维度的，而思想的主体和思想的对象是有维度的。至于那些没有维度的物体，人们则给它们设定界线，赋予它们维度，以便易于理解。这充分表明，饱学之士视灵魂或灵仅为思想，而不是别的什么，如此只会认为当他们死亡时，灵魂就会消失。</p>

<p><strong>[NCE]445.</strong> I said further that the erudite fully believe the soul that lives on after death — the spirit — is abstract thought. Obviously, then, they refuse to accept any term that involves dimension or anything implied by dimension. Thought has no extension apart from the person thinking, but the person thinking and the objects of thought do have extension. Moreover, if the objects of thought are not dimensional, people objectify them and make them three-dimensional in order to understand them. From this it is abundantly clear that intellectuals take the soul or spirit to be nothing but pure thought. The consequence is an unalterable belief that the soul will vanish when they die. </p>

It was further remarked, that the learned have no other belief than that the soul which is to live after death, that is, the spirit, is abstract thought. This is very manifest from their unwillingness 
to admit of any term that implies extension and what belongs to extension, because thought abstractedly from a subject is not extended, whereas the subject of the thought, and the objects of the thought, 
are extended; and as for those objects which are not extended, men define them by boundaries and give extension to them, in order that they may comprehend them. This shows very clearly that the 
learned have no other conception of the soul or spirit than that it is mere thought, and so cannot but believe that it will vanish when they die. </p>

I have in addition been told that learned people believe no more than this, that the soul, which will live on after death - or the spirit - is abstract thought. This is quite evident from the fact that 
they refuse to entertain any term implying that which is dimensional, or things of a dimensional nature, the reason being that thought isolated from a subject is undimensional, whereas both the subject 
and the object of thought are dimensional. And to comprehend objects which are not dimensional, people set boundaries to them and make them dimensional. From this it is quite clear that learned people 
conceive of the soul or spirit as being nothing other than thought alone. That being so they are incapable of believing otherwise than that when they die the soul will fade away.  </p>

</p><b>445.</b>
Porro dictum quod eruditi nihil aliud credant quam quod anima quae victum post mortem, seu spiritus, sit cogitatio abstracta; patet manifeste inde quod vocem extensi, et quorum sunt extensi, nolint 
admittere, ex causa quia cogitatio abstracte a subjecto non est extensa, sed subjectum cogitationis et objecta cogitationis sunt extensa; et quae objecta non sunt extensa, finiunt ea homines et faciunt 
extensa ut capiant; exinde manifeste constat quod eruditi per animam aut spiritum, nihil aliud capiant quam cogitationem solam; et quod nusquam aliter credere possint quam quod evanitura, cum moriuntur. </p>
