<h3 align="center" class="ired">属天的奥秘 第10030节</h3>
<h4 align="center"></h4><p><strong>10030</strong>.“遮盖肠子的”表存在于最末或最低层的。这从“肠子”的含义清楚可知，“肠子”是指最末或最低的事物。“肠子”之所以具有这种含义，是因为它们是人内脏的最末和最低部分，不仅在位置上是最末和最低的，而且在功能上也是最末和最低的。就位置而言，它们在胃部下面，与胃相连；就功能而言，它们接受人里面已消化的东西。众所周知，它们上面是胃、肝、胰、脾；再往上是心和肺；最上面是头。身体更优越的器官或更高级的部位把其污物和废物排入肠道，将它们部分经由胃，部分经由被称为肝管的肝脏导管，以及胆囊管或胆管，部分通过胰管（胰管和其它一切导管一样，都有进入十二指肠的出口）通过这些肠道排出。由此明显可知为何“肠子”表示最末或最低的事物。人体的内部器官表示诸如属于灵界的那类事物，这一事实从许多章节末尾的大量说明可以看出来，那里论述了大人，就是天堂与存在于人里面的一切事物的对应关系。至于肠子具体对应什么，可参看前文（<a href="5392.htm">5392</a>节）。地狱对应于从肠道排出的渣滓和排泄物（<a href="5393.htm">5393</a>-<a href="5396.htm">5396</a>节）。<br />由于接下来提到了几个身体器官，如小网膜、肝、肾、腿、胸、胁或肩、头；还论述了在献祭时对它们的排列，所以必须在此首先说明，人体的各个部位一般表示存在于大人，也就是天堂里的那类事物。在此仅说明但以理书中用来描述尼布甲尼撒雕像的那几个身体部位的含义；在那里，经上说：<br />它的头是纯金的，胸膛和膀臂是银的，肚腹和腰是铜的，腿是铁的，脚是半铁半泥的。（但以理书<a href="http://39-27.cn/但2.32.htm">2:32</a>，<a href="http://39-27.cn/但2.33.htm">33</a>）<br />人若不知道主的圣言是属灵的，就会以为这些话论及地上的国度。但圣言并不论述地上的国度，只论述神的国度，因而只论述天堂和教会。这些之所以通过存在于地上和地上国度中的那类事物来描述，是因为世俗和地上的事物对应于存在于天堂中的那类事物。因为整个自然界和整个世界就是代表主国度的一个舞台（参看<a href="9280.htm">9280</a>节所提到的地方），地上和世俗的事物是一个人首先知道的东西。<br />由此可见，尼布甲尼撒在梦中所见到的这像并非表示世俗事物，而是表示天堂事物。至于头、胸膛、肚腹、腰、腿和脚具体表示什么，这从它们的对应关系，因而从圣言的内义可以得知。从对应关系可知，“头”表示教会的第一个状态；“胸膛和膀臂”表示第二个状态；“肚腹和腰”表示第三个状态；“腿”表示第四个状态；“脚”表示最后一个状态。教会的第一个状态是对主之爱的良善的状态，故经上说“头是纯金的”；第二个状态是源于这良善的真理的状态，故经上说“胸膛和膀臂是银的”；第三个状态是外在人或属世人中的爱之良善及其真理，故经上说“肚腹和腰是铜的”；第四个状态是信之真理，故经上说“腿是铁的”；最后一个状态是真理，这真理虽被称为信之真理，却缺乏良善，故经上说“脚是半铁半泥的”。由于教会的最后状态是这样，所以经上说“从磐石中凿出一块石头，将它们都砸碎，风把它们吹散，无处可寻”（但以理书<a href="http://39-27.cn/但2.34.htm">2:34</a>，<a href="http://39-27.cn/但2.35.htm">35</a>）；意思是说，对主之爱的良善，对邻之仁的良善和信之良善都完全被驱散，彻底不复存在，以致没有人知道它们是什么。只有关于信之真理的某种知识，没有任何关于良善的知识存在；即便关于良善的某种知识存在，它也不是真正的良善，因而不是与信之真理一致的良善。<br />这良善是没有内在的外在良善，就是那种邀功的良善，以及为了自我和世界，因而为了利益、地位、名声和由这些东西所培养的友谊，或为了讨好的良善；或者追求良善仅仅是因为害怕法律，不是因为仁之良善，就是同胞的利益，人类社会的利益，国家利益或教会利益。<br />前面提到的这类良善由“泥”或“土”来表示，与这良善不一致的真理是“铁”。所以经上说：<br />你既见铁与泥搀杂，他们也必与人种搀杂，却不能彼此相合，正如铁与泥不能相合一样。（但以理书<a href="http://39-27.cn/但2.43.htm">2:43</a>）<br />“人种”是指源于人之自我的信之真理，也就是被歪曲并通过应用于出于关注自我和世界的邪恶而被玷污的真理。由此明显可知，人身体的各个部位，从头到脚趾，都表示诸如属于教会的那类事物。<br />“头”一般表示属天良善，就是对主之爱的良善；“胸膛”表示属灵良善，就是对邻之仁的良善；“脚”表示属世良善，就是信之良善与真理（参看<a href="9913.htm">9913</a>，<a href="9914.htm">9914</a>节）；“金”、“银”、“铜”、“铁”也表示这类事物（<a href="5658.htm">5658</a>节）。不过，至于“头”具体表示什么，可参看4938， 4939， 5328， 9913， 9914节；“胸膛”表示什么，可参看4938， 4939， 5328， 6436， 9913， 9914节；“银”表示什么，可参看1551， 5658， 6914， 6917节。由此明显可知“肚腹”和“腰”，就是胸以下的部位表示什么。至于“铜”表示什么，可参看425， 1551节；“脚”表示什么，可参看2162， 3147， 3761， 4938-4952节；“铁”表示什么，可参看425， 426节；“泥”或“土”表示什么，可参看1300， 6669节。<br />由此可知，人体的部位或器官表示诸如与大人，就是天堂里的事物相对应的那类事物。它们都与爱之良善和信之真理有关；它们因对应于这些事物，故也对应于教会中的这些事物，因为主在地上的天堂就是教会。人，以及人的各个部位与大人，就是天堂存在一种对应关系（可参看许多章节末尾根据经历本身所作的说明，如这些章节：<a href="3624.htm">3624</a>-<a href="3649.htm">3649</a>，<a href="3741.htm">3741</a>-<a href="3751.htm">3751</a>，<a href="3883.htm">3883</a>-<a href="3896.htm">3896</a>，<a href="4039.htm">4039</a>-<a href="4051.htm">4051</a>，<a href="4218.htm">4218</a>-<a href="4228.htm">4228</a>，<a href="4318.htm">4318</a>-<a href="4331.htm">4331</a>，<a href="4403.htm">4403</a>-<a href="4421.htm">4421</a>，<a href="4527.htm">4527</a>-<a href="4533.htm">4533</a>，<a href="4622.htm">4622</a>-<a href="4633.htm">4633</a>，<a href="4652.htm">4652</a>-<a href="4660.htm">4660</a>，<a href="4791.htm">4791</a>-<a href="4805.htm">4805</a>，<a href="4931.htm">4931</a>-<a href="4953.htm">4953</a>，<a href="5050.htm">5050</a>-<a href="5061.htm">5061</a>，<a href="5171.htm">5171</a>-<a href="5189.htm">5189</a>，<a href="5377.htm">5377</a>-<a href="5396.htm">5396</a>，<a href="5552.htm">5552</a>-<a href="5573.htm">5573</a>，<a href="5711.htm">5711</a>-<a href="5727.htm">5727</a>，<a href="5846.htm">5846</a>-<a href="5866.htm">5866</a>，<a href="5976.htm">5976</a>-<a href="5993.htm">5993</a>，<a href="6053.htm">6053</a>-<a href="6058.htm">6058</a>，<a href="6189.htm">6189</a>-<a href="6215.htm">6215</a>，<a href="6307.htm">6307</a>-<a href="6326.htm">6326</a>，<a href="6466.htm">6466</a>-<a href="6495.htm">6495</a>节。以及何为对应，<a href="2987.htm">2987</a>-<a href="3003.htm">3003</a>，<a href="3213.htm">3213</a>-<a href="3227.htm">3227</a>，<a href="3337.htm">3337</a>-<a href="3352.htm">3352</a>，<a href="3472.htm">3472</a>-<a href="3485.htm">3485</a>节）。</p>

That covereth the intestines. That this signifies which pertains to ultimate or lowest things, is evident from the signification of "the intestines," as being ultimate or lowest things. "The intestines" 
denote ultimate or lowest things because they are the ultimate and lowest of man's interior viscera, not only in respect to situation, but also in respect to use. In respect to situation they are 
below the stomach, to which they are appended; and in respect to use, they receive last the things digested in man. Above them, as is known, are the stomach, liver, pancreas, and spleen; and still further 
above are the heart and lungs; and above all is the head. It is also known that the superior organs cast their filth and refuse into the intestines, and thereby remove it, partly by means of the 
stomach, partly by means of the ducts from the liver, called the hepatic ducts, and also the cystic or biliary, partly by means of the ducts from the pancreas, which with the rest have their outlets into 
the intestine called the duodenum; from which it is now evident why ultimate or lowest things are signified by "the intestines." (That by the viscera in man are signified such things as are of the 
spiritual world, can be seen from what has been abundantly shown at the end of many chapters, where the correspondence of the Grand Man, which is heaven, with all things in man, has been treated of. 
What in particular corresponds to the intestines, see in n. 5392; and that the hells correspond to the feces and excrements thence ejected, n. 5393-5396.) [2] As in what now follows mention is made of 
some parts of the body, as the caul, liver, and kidneys, also the legs, breast, shoulders, and head; and as the ordering of them in the sacrifices is treated of, it shall first be shown that by man's 
members in general are signified such things as are in the Grand Man, that is, in heaven; here only those by which the statue of Nebuchadnezzar is described in Daniel: </p>
<p>     Its head was of pure gold, 
its breast and arms of silver, its belly and sides of brass, its legs of iron, and its feet part of iron and part of clay (Dan. 2:32, 33); </p>
<p>one who does not know that the Word of the Lord is spiritual, 
believes that this was said of the kingdoms of the earth; but in the Word the kingdoms of the earth are not treated of, but the kingdom of God, thus heaven and the church. These are described by 
such things as are on earth and in the kingdoms of earth, because worldly and earthly things correspond to such as are in heaven; for all nature and the whole world is a theater representative of the 
Lord's kingdom (see the places cited in n. 9280), and earthly and worldly things are what man first apprehends. [3] From this it can be seen that by the statue seen by Nebuchadnezzar in a dream are not 
signified earthly, but heavenly things; but what is specifically signified by the head, breast, belly, and sides, and by the legs and feet, can be known from their correspondence, thus from the internal 
sense of the Word. From correspondence it is known that by the "head" is signified the first state of the church; by the "breast and arms" the second, by the "belly and side" the third, by the "legs" 
the fourth, and by the "feet" the last. As the first state of the church was a state of good of love to the Lord, it is said that "the head was of gold;" and as the second state was a state of truth 
from this good, it is said that "the breast and arms were of silver;" and as the third state was the good of love and its truth in the external or natural man, it is said that "the belly and sides 
were of brass;" and as the fourth state was the truth of faith, it is said that "the legs were of iron;" and as the last state was truth, which is called of faith, without good, it is said that "the 
feet were part of iron and part of clay." And as such a state of the church was the last, it is said that "out of the rock was cut a stone, which brake in pieces and scattered all things, so that the 
wind carried them away, and no place was found for them" (Dan. 2:34, 35). By this is signified that the good of love to the Lord, the good of charity toward the neighbor, and the good of faith, had completely 
disappeared, insomuch that it was not known what they are; but only something about the truths of faith without good, or with good which is not good, thus which does not cohere with the truths 
of faith. [4] This good is external good without internal, such as is the good of merit, good for the sake of self and for the sake of the world; thus for the sake of profit, honor, and reputation; 
for the sake of friendship on account of these, or for the sake of favor; and also merely on account of the fear of the law; and not for the sake of the good of charity, which is the good of one's fellow-citizen 
the good of human society, the good of our country, and the good of the church.  [5] Such goods as are mentioned above are signified by "clay," or "mire," and the truth with which this 
good does not cohere is "iron." Therefore it is said: </p>
<p>     The iron, which thou sawest mixed with miry clay, they shall mingle themselves with the seed of man, but they shall not cleave one to another, 
even as iron doth not mingle with clay (Dan. 2:43); </p>
<p>"the seed of man" denotes the truth of faith from man's own, thus truth falsified and adulterated by application to evils from regard to self and 
the world. From all this it is evident that by the members of man, from his head down to the sole of the foot, are signified such things as belong to the church. [6] (That in general the "head" signifies 
celestial good, which is the good of love to the Lord; the "breast," spiritual good, which is the good of charity toward the neighbor; and the "feet," natural good, which is the good and truth 
of faith, see n. 9913, 9914; also that similar things are signified by "gold," "silver," "brass," and "iron," n. 5658; what is specifically signified by the "head," see n. 4938, 4939, 5328, 9913, 9914; 
what by "gold," n. 113, 1551, 1552, 5658, 9510, 9881; what by the "breast," n. 4938, 4939, 5328, 6436, 9913, 9914; what by "silver," n. 1551, 5658, 6914, 6917. From this it is evident what is signified 
by the "belly" and the "sides," which are below the breast; but what is signified by "brass," see n. 425, 1551; what by the "feet," n. 2162, 3147, 3761, 4938-4952; what by "iron," n. 425, 426; and 
what by "clay," or "mire," n. 1300, 6669.)  [7] From all this it can now be known that by the members and viscera of man are signified such things as correspond to those in the Grand Man, or in heaven, 
all of which bear relation to the good of love and the truth of faith; and the things that correspond to these correspond also to the same things in the church, for the Lord's heaven on earth is the 
church. That there is a correspondence of man and of all things pertaining to man with the Grand Man, which is heaven, see what has been shown from experience itself at the end of many chapters, at 
these places, n. 3624-3649, 3741-3751, 3883-3896, 4039-4051, 4218-4228, 4318-4331, 4403-4421, 4527-4533, 4622-4633, 4652-4660, 4791-4805, 4931-4953, 5050-5061, 5171-5189, 5377-5396, 5552-5573, 5711-5727, 
5846-5866, 5976-5993, 6053-6058, 6189-6215, 6307-6326, 6466-6495. Also what correspondence is, n. 2987-3003, 3213-3227, 3337-3352, 3472-3485.) </p>

<p align="center"><b>Elliott(1983-1999) 10030</b></p><p><b>10030.</b>
'Covering the intestines' means which exists on last or lowest levels. This is clear from the meaning of 'the intestines' as last or lowest things. The reason why the intestines have this meaning is 
that they are the last and lowest of a person's internal organs, not only as regards their location but also as regards their function. As regards their location, they are below the stomach, to which 
they are attached; and as regards their function, they are the last organs to receive the things undergoing digestion in a person. Above them, as is well known, come the stomach, liver, pancreas, and 
spleen; higher still, the heart and lungs; and still higher, the head. It is also well known that these higher parts of the body discharge their filth and waste products into the intestines and banish 
them through these, partly by way of the stomach, partly by way of the ducts from the liver - called the hepatic ducts, and also the cystic or biliary ducts - and partly by way of the ducts from the 
pancreas, which like all the other ducts have their outlet into the duodenum. From all this it is now evident why last or lowest things are meant by 'the intestines'. The fact that the internal organs 
in the human body mean such things as belong to the spiritual world becomes clear from what has been abundantly shown at the ends of a large number of chapters where the correspondence of the Grand Man, 
which is heaven, with everything present in the human being has been the subject. For what specifically corresponds to the intestines, see <a href="5392.htm">5392</a>. The hells correspond to the impurities and excrement 
cast out from them, <a href="5393.htm">5393</a>-<a href="5396.htm">5396</a>.  </p>
<p></p>
<p><b>[2]</b>
 Since several organs of the body are mentioned in what immediately follows, such as the lesser omentum, liver, kidneys, legs, breast, flank, and head, and the 
arrangement of them in sacrifices is dealt with, it must first be shown here that by parts of the human body in general the kinds of things that exist in the Grand Man, that is, in heaven, are meant. 
Here let the meaning of just those parts of the body which are used in Daniel to describe Nebuchadnezzar's statue be indicated. There, in Chapter 2:32,<a href="33.htm">33</a>, it says that its head was pure gold, breast and 
arms were silver, belly and side bronze, legs iron, and feet partly iron and partly clay. Anyone who does not know that the Lord's Word is spiritual supposes that these things were said in reference 
to earthly kingdoms. But the Word is not dealing with earthly kingdoms, only with God's kingdom, thus with heaven and the Church. The reason why these are described by means of the kinds of things that 
exist in earthly lands and their kingdoms is that worldly and earthly things correspond to the kinds of things that exist in heaven. For the whole natural order and the whole universe is a theatre 
representative of the Lord's kingdom, see the places referred to in <a href="9280.htm">9280</a>, and earthly and worldly things are what a person comes to know of first.  </p>
<p></p>
<p><b>[3]</b>
 From this it may be recognized that Nebuchadnezzar's 
statue seen in a dream does not mean worldly but heavenly things. But what specifically is meant by the head, the breast, the belly and side, the legs, and the feet may be known from their correspondence, 
thus from the internal sense of the Word. From correspondence one can know that the head means the first state of the Church, the breast and arms the second, the belly and side the third, 
the legs the fourth, and the feet the last. Since the first state of the Church was a state of the good of love to the Lord it says that the head was of pure gold; since the second state was a state 
of truth springing from that good it says that the breast and arms were of silver; since the third state was the good of love and its truth in the external or natural man it says that the belly and side 
were of bronze; since the fourth state was the truth of faith it says that the legs were of iron; and since the last state was truth which, though called the truth of faith, is devoid of good it says 
the feet were partly of iron and partly of clay. And such being the last state of the Church verses 34,35 say that out of the rock a stone was cut, which smashed them all to pieces and  scattered 
them, so that the wind carried them away, and no place was found for them, meaning that the good of love to the Lord, the good of charity towards the neighbour, and the good of faith were completely dispersed, 
so completely that there was no knowledge of what they were. No more than some knowledge of the truths of faith existed, without any knowledge of good; or if any knowledge of good existed it 
was not real good, thus was not the good that coheres with the truths of faith. </p>
<p><b>[4]</b>
 This good is external good without internal, which is what the good of merit is, and what good pursued for selfish 
and worldly reasons is, thus good pursued for the sake of gain, position, and reputation, for the sake of friendship cultivated because of these things, or for the sake of currying favour. Or else it 
is pursued solely on account of fear of the law. It is not pursued on account of the good of charity, which is the good of one's fellow citizen, the good of human society, the good of one's country, or 
the good of the Church. </p>
<p><b>[5]</b>
 The types of good mentioned above are meant by 'the clay' or 'the mire', the truth with which that good does not cohere being 'the iron'. Therefore verse 43 says, [Just as] 
the iron which you saw was mixed with the miry clay, they will mingle through the seed of man (homo)<A name="fntext1"></a><A href="#fn1"><sup>a</sup></a>, but they will not cohere with one another, just as iron is not mingled with clay. 'The seed of 
man' is the truth of faith when it originates in the self, which is truth falsified and adulterated through application to evils that exist as the result of a regard for self and the world. From all 
this it is evident that the parts of a person's body from his head to the soles of his feet mean such things as belong to the Church.  </p>
<p></p>
<p><b>[6]</b>
 In general 'the head' means celestial good, which is the good 
of love to the Lord, 'the breast' spiritual good, which is the good of charity towards the neighbour, and 'the feet' natural good, which is the good and truth of faith, see <a href="9913.htm">9913</a>, <a href="9914.htm">9914</a>; and the same 
kinds of good are meant by 'gold', 'silver', 'bronze', and 'iron', <a href="5658.htm">5658</a>. But for what is meant specifically by 'the head', see <a href="4938.htm">4938</a>, <a href="4939.htm">4939</a>, <a href="5328.htm">5328</a>, <a href="9913.htm">9913</a>, <a href="9914.htm">9914</a>, by 'gold', <a href="113.htm">113</a>, <a href="1551.htm">1551</a>, <a href="1552.htm">1552</a>, <a href="5658.htm">5658</a>, <a href="9510.htm">9510</a>, <a href="9881.htm">9881</a>, 
by 'the breast', <a href="4938.htm">4938</a>, <a href="4939.htm">4939</a>, <a href="5328.htm">5328</a>, <a href="6436.htm">6436</a>, <a href="9913.htm">9913</a>, <a href="9914.htm">9914</a>, and by 'silver', <a href="1551.htm">1551</a>, <a href="5658.htm">5658</a>, <a href="6914.htm">6914</a>, <a href="6917.htm">6917</a>. From this it is evident what is meant by 'the belly' and 'the side', which are the parts below the breast. 
But for what 'bronze' means, [see] <a href="425.htm">425</a>, <a href="1551.htm">1551</a>, 'the feet', <a href="2162.htm">2162</a>, <a href="3147.htm">3147</a>, <a href="3761.htm">3761</a>, <a href="4938.htm">4938</a>-<a href="4952.htm">4952</a>, 'iron', <a href="425.htm">425</a>, <a href="426.htm">426</a>, and 'clay' or 'mire', <a href="1300.htm">1300</a>, <a href="6669.htm">6669</a>. </p>
<p></p>
<p><b>[7]</b>
 From all this it may now be recognized that the 
members or organs of the human body mean such things as correspond to them in the Grand Man, which is heaven. They all have connection with the good of love and the truth of faith; and because they correspond 
to these they also correspond to the same realities in the Church, because the Lord's heaven on earth is the Church.  </p>
<p>There is a correspondence of the human being and all parts of the human 
being with the Grand Man, which is heaven; see what has been shown from actual experience at the ends of a number of chapters, in the following places, <a href="3624.htm">3624</a>-<a href="3649.htm">3649</a>, <a href="3741.htm">3741</a>-<a href="3751.htm">3751</a>, <a href="3883.htm">3883</a>-<a href="3896.htm">3896</a>, <a href="4039.htm">4039</a>-<a href="4051.htm">4051</a>, <a href="4218.htm">4218</a>-<a href="4228.htm">4228</a>, <a href="4318.htm">4318</a>-<a href="4331.htm">4331</a>, <a href="4403.htm">4403</a>-<a href="4421.htm">4421</a>, <a href="4527.htm">4527</a>-<a href="4533.htm">4533</a>, <a href="4622.htm">4622</a>-<a href="4633.htm">4633</a>, <a href="4652.htm">4652</a>-<a href="4660.htm">4660</a>, <a href="4791.htm">4791</a>-<a href="4805.htm">4805</a>, <a href="4931.htm">4931</a>-<a href="4953.htm">4953</a>, <a href="5050.htm">5050</a>-<a href="5061.htm">5061</a>, <a href="5171.htm">5171</a>-<a href="5189.htm">5189</a>, <a href="5377.htm">5377</a>-<a href="5396.htm">5396</a>, <a href="5552.htm">5552</a>-<a href="5573.htm">5573</a>, <a href="5711.htm">5711</a>-<a href="5727.htm">5727</a>, <a href="5846.htm">5846</a>-<a href="5866.htm">5866</a>, <a href="5976.htm">5976</a>-<a href="5993.htm">5993</a>, <a href="6053.htm">6053</a>-<a href="6058.htm">6058</a>, <a href="6189.htm">6189</a>-<a href="6215.htm">6215</a>, <a href="6307.htm">6307</a>-<a href="6326.htm">6326</a>, <a href="6466.htm">6466</a>-<a href="6495.htm">6495</a>.

</p><b>10030.</b>
`Tegentem intestina': quod significet quod ultimis seu infimis, constat ex significatione `intestinorum' quod sint ultima seu infima; quod intestina sint ultima seu infima, est quia sunt ultima et infima 
viscerum interiorum hominis, non modo quoad situm sed etiam quoad usum; quoad situm, sunt infra ventriculum cui appendantur, et quoad usum, ultimo recipiunt illa quae apud hominem digeruntur; supra 
illa sunt, ut notum est, ventriculus, hepar, pancreas, lien, et superius adhuc cor et pulmo, et adhuc superius caput; etiam notum est quod superiora haec suas sordes (o)et sua recrementa conjiciant 
in intestina, et per illa amandent (o)ea, partim per ventriculum, partim per ductus ex hepate, qui vocantur ductus hepatici, ut et cystici seu biliares {1}, partim per ductus ex pancreate, qui ductus 
cum reliquis {2} exitus suos habent in intestinum duodenum; inde nunc patet cur per intestina significantur ultima seu infima.  Quod per viscera quae apud {3} hominem, significentur talia quae spiritualis 
mundi sunt, {4} constare potest ex illis quae ad finem plurium capitum ubi de correspondentia Maximi Hominis, quod est caelum, cum omnibus apud hominem, actum est, copiose ostensa sunt; quid in 
specie correspondet intestinis, videatur n. 5392, et {5} quod inferna correspondeant ejectis inde faecibus et excrementis {6}, n. 5393-5396. 	[2] Quia in sequentibus nunc memorantur aliquot viscera 
corporis, sicut reticulum, hepar, renes, crura, pectus, armus, caput, ac de ordinatione eorum in sacrificiis {7} agitur, ideo luc primum ostendendum est quod per hominis membra in genere significentur 
talia quae in Maximo Homine sunt, hoc est, in caelo, hic solum per illa per quae {8} describitur statua Nebucadnezaris apud Danielem,      	Quod ejus caput esset aurum purum, pectus et bracchia argentum, 
venter et latus {9} aes, crura ferrum, et pedes ex parte ferrum et ex parte argilla, ii 32, 33; </p>
<p>qui non scit quod Verbum Domini sit spirituale, credit quod illa de regnis terrae dicta sint, sed 
in Verbo non agitur de regnis terrae, sed de regno Dei, ita de caelo et de Ecclesia; quod haec {10} per talia quae sunt in tertis, et in harum {11} regnis, describantur, est causa quia mundana et terrestria 
correspondent talibus quae in caelo sunt; est enim universa natura, et universus mundus theatrum repraesentativum regni Domini {12}, (o)videantur citata n. 9280, et terrestria ac mundana {13} 
sunt quae homo primum capit {14}; [3] inde constare potest quod per statuam Nebucadnezari visam in somnio non significentur mundana sed caelestia; sed quid in specie per caput, per pectus, per ventrem 
et latus, per crura, et per pedes significatur, ex correspondentia illorum, ita ex sensu interno Verbi, sciri potest; ex correspondentia scitur quod per caput significetur primus status Ecclesiae, per 
pectus et bracchia secundus, per ventrem et latus tertius, et per crura quartus, ac per pedes ultimus; quia primus status Ecclesiae fuit status boni amoris in Dominum, dicitur quod caput esset ex auro 
puro, et quia secundus status fuit status veri ex illo bono {15}, dicitur quod pectus et bracchia essent ex argento, et quia tertius status fuit bonum amoris et ejus verum in externo seu naturali homine, 
dicitur quod venter et latus essent ex aere, et quia quartus status fuit verum fidei, dicitur quod crura essent ex ferro, et quia ultimus status fuit verum, quod fidei vocatur, absque bono, dicitur 
quod pedes essent quoad partem ex ferro, et quoad partem ex argilla; et quia talis status Ecclesiae ultimus fuit, dicitur quod ex petra excisus sit lapis, qui contrivit et dispersit omnia, adeo {16} 
ut abstulerit ea ventus, et nullus locus inventus sit illis, (o)vers. 34, 35, per quae significatur quod bonum amoris (o)in Dominum, bonum charitatis (o)erga proximum, et bonum fidei prorsus disparata 
sint, usque (o)adeo ut non sciretur quid sunt, sed modo aliquid de veris fidei absque bono, seu cum bono quod non bonum est, ita quod non cohaeret cum veris fidei; [4] hoc bonum est bonum externum 
absque interno, quale est bonum meriti, bonum propter se et propter mundum, ita propter (t)lucra, honorem, (o)et famam, propter amicitias illorum causa, aut propter favorem {17}, et quoque solum propter 
timorem legis (o)et non propter bonum charitatis, quod est bonum concivis, bonum societatis humanae, bonum patriae, et bonum Ecclesiae; [5] talia bona quae supra dicta sunt significantur {18} per 
`argillam' seu `lutum,'{19} verum cum quo id bonum non cohaeret, est `ferrum'; ideo dicitur,      	Ferrum quod vidisti mixtum cum argilla luti, (x)commiscebunt se per semen hominis, sed non cohaerebunt 
unum cum altero, quemadmodum ferrum non commiscetur cum argilla, vers. 43; </p>
<p>`semen hominis' est verum fidei ex proprio, ita verum falsificatum e adulteratum per applicationem ad mala ex intuitione 
sui et mundi; ex his {20} patet {21} quod per membra hominis a capite ejus usque ad plantam pedis significentur talia quae sunt Ecclesiae. 	[6] (s)Quod in genere `caput' significet caeleste bonum, quod 
est bonum amoris in Dominum, `pectus' spirituale bonum, quod est bonum charitatis erga proximum, et quod `pedes' naturale bonum, quod est bonum (o)et verum fidei, videatur n. 9913, 9914; quod etiam 
{22} similia per aurum, argentum, aes, (o)et ferrum, n. 5658; quid autem in specie (o)significatur per `caput,'(s) (o)videatur n. 4938, 4939, 5328, 9913, 9914, quid per `aurum,' n. 113, 1551, 1552, 
5658, 9510, 9881, quid (d)per `pectus,' n. 4938, 4939, 5328, 6436, 9913, 9914, quid (d)per `argentum,' n. 1551, 5658, 6914, 6917; inde patet quid significatur per `ventrem' et per `latus,' quae sunt infra 
pectus; quid autem (d)per `aes,' n. 425, 1551, quid (d)per `pedes,' n. 2162, 3147, 3761, 4938-4952, quid per `ferrum,' n. 425, 426, et quid per `argillam' seu `lutum,' n. 1300, 6669. 	[7] Ex his 
nunc sciri {23} potest quod per membra seu viscera hominis significentur talia quae eis correspondent in Maximo Homine, seu in caelo, quae omnia se referunt ad bonum amoris et (o)ad verum fidei, et quia 
{24} correspondent his {25}, etiam correspondent iisdem {26} in Ecclesia, nam caelum Domini in terris est Ecclesia.  (s)Quod correspondentia sit hominis et omnium apud hominem cum Maximo Homine, quod 
est caelum, videantur quae ab ipsa experientia ad finem plurium capitum ostensa sunt, in his locis, n. 3624-3649, 3741-3751, 3883-3896, 4039-4051, 4218-4228, 4318-4331, 4403-4421, 4527-4533, 4622-4633,
