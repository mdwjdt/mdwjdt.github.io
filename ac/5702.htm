<h3 align="center" class="ired">属天的奥秘 第5702节</h3>
<h4 align="center"></h4><p><strong>5702.</strong>“那原是埃及人所憎恶的”表他们处于对立面。这从“埃及人”和“希伯来人”的代表清楚可知：“埃及人”是指那些处于颠倒次序的人（参看<a href="5700.htm">5700</a>节）；与“希伯来人”吃饭原是埃及人所憎恶的，其中“希伯来人”是指那些处于真正次序的人（<a href="5701.htm">5701</a>节）。因此，这二者是彼此对立的，这种对立产生强烈的厌恶，最终成了可憎恶的。关于这种憎恶，要知道，那些处于颠倒次序，也就是陷入邪恶和随之的虚假之人最终会变得如此厌恶教会的良善与真理，以致当听见它们，尤其听见它们的内层事物时，他们发现这些东西如此可憎，以致他们觉得恶心，想要呕吐。当我想知道为何基督教界不接受圣言的这些内层事物时，便被告知并指示这一点。基督教界的灵人出现了，并被迫听见圣言的内层；然后他们因这些东西而如此恶心，以致他们说，他们觉得自己很想呕吐。我也被告知，这就是当今基督教界的样子，几乎处处都是这样。基督教界之所以成了这样子，是因为他们没有为了真理的缘故而对真理的情感，更没有出于良善而对良善的任何情感。他们基于圣言或其教义所思、所说的任何东西，都是出于自童年早期所习得的习惯，出于宗教习俗，因而是一种没有内在的外在。<br />后来在雅各的后代当中所建立的希伯来教会的一切都是埃及人所憎恶的，这一事实不仅从他们不愿与希伯来人一同吃饭，而且还从他们憎恶希伯来教会视之为敬拜的主要部分的祭祀明显看出来，这一点清楚可见于摩西五经：<br />法老说，你们去，在这地祭祀你们的神吧！摩西说，这样行本不相宜，因为我们要把埃及人所憎恶的祭祀耶和华我们的神；看哪，若把埃及人所憎恶的，在他们眼前献为祭，他们岂不拿石头打死我们吗？（出埃及记<a href="http://39-27.cn/出8.25.htm">8:25</a>，<a href="http://39-27.cn/出8.26.htm">26</a>）<br />牧养牲畜，作牧人，也是他们所憎恶的，这一点也体现在摩西五经中：<br />凡牧羊的，都被埃及人所憎恶。（创世记<a href="http://39-27.cn/创46.34.htm">46:34</a>）<br />因此，埃及人憎恶属于该教会的一切。原因在于，起初埃及甚至也在那些构成代表性古教会的人之列（<a href="1238.htm">1238</a>，<a href="2385.htm">2385</a>节）；但随着时间推移，他们却弃绝古教会的神，也就是耶和华或主，去事奉偶像，尤其事奉牛犊。他们还将他们尚属古教会时所获知的古教会的属天和属灵事物的实际代表和有意义的符号变为巫术。正因如此，他们当中的次序被颠倒了；结果，构成那教会的一切成了他们所憎恶的。</p>

Because this is an abomination to the Egyptians. That this signifies that they are in opposition, is evident from the representation of the Egyptians, as being those who are in inverted order (see n. 
5700); and from the representation of the Hebrews, to eat with whom was an abomination to the Egyptians, as being those who are in genuine order (n. 5701); thus they are in opposition to each other, 
whence comes aversion, and at last abomination. In regard to this abomination be it known that those who are in inverted order, that is, in evil and the derivative falsity, become at last so averse to 
the good and truth of the church that when they hear them, and especially when they hear the interior things of them, they so greatly abominate them that they feel as it were a nausea and vomiting. This 
has been told and shown me, when I have wondered why the Christian world does not receive these interior things of the Word. There appeared spirits from the Christian world who, on being compelled 
to hear the interiors of the Word, were seized with so great a nausea that they said they felt as if they were going to vomit; and I was told that such is the Christian world at this day almost everywhere. 
The reason of its being so is that they are in no affection of truth for truth's sake, still less in the affection of good from good. Their thinking and speaking anything from the Word or from 
their doctrine is from habit acquired from early childhood, and from the established form; thus it is an external without an internal.  [2] That all things of the Hebrew Church that was afterward instituted 
among Jacob's descendants were an abomination to the Egyptians, is plain not only from their being unwilling even to eat with them, but also from the sacrifices which the Hebrew Church regarded 
as the chief part of its worship being an abomination to them, as is evident in Moses: </p>
<p>	Pharaoh said, Go ye, sacrifice in the land; but Moses said, It is not meet so to do; because we shall sacrifice 
the abomination of the Egyptians to Jehovah our God; lo if we sacrifice the abomination of the Egyptians before their eyes will they not stone us? (Exod. 8:25, 26). The pasturing of flocks, and a 
shepherd also, were an abomination to them, as is plain in Moses: </p>
<p>	Every shepherd of a flock is an abomination unto the Egyptians (Gen. 46:34). Thus the Egyptians abominated everything that belonged 
to that church. The reason was that at first the Egyptians had been among those who constituted the Ancient representative Church (n. 1238, 2385); but in course of time they rejected the God of the Ancient 
Church, that is, Jehovah or the Lord, and served idols, especially calves; and they also turned into magic the very representatives and significatives of the celestial and spiritual things of the 
Ancient Church, which they had learned when they belonged to that church. Hence order was inverted with them, and consequently all things of the church were an abomination to them. </p>

<p align="center"><b>Elliott(1983-1999) 5702</b></p><p><b>5702.</b>
'Since that is an abomination to the Egyptians' means that they are in a contrary position. This is clear from the representation of 'the Egyptians' as those with whom order has been inverted, <a href="5700.htm">5700</a>; 
and from the representation of 'the Hebrews', to eat with whom was an abomination to the Egyptians, as those with whom genuine order exists, <a href="5701.htm">5701</a>. Thus the two are set in contrary positions, and this 
gives rise to strong dislike and at length to what is an abomination. Regarding this abomination, it should be recognized that people with whom an inverted state of order, that is, evil and consequent 
falsity, exists, thereby come at length to acquire a strong dislike for the goodness and truth of the Church the moment they hear it referred to. This is even more true when they hear reference made 
to the interior aspects of that goodness and truth; they find these so abominable that so to speak they feel nauseated and wish to vomit. This is what I have been told and shown to be so when I have wondered 
why the Christian world does not accept the interior teachings of the Word. Spirits from the Christian world have appeared on the scene and have been compelled to hear about the interior teachings 
of the Word; they were then so nauseated by these that they said they felt within themselves the great need to vomit. I have also been told that this is what the Christian world is like virtually 
everywhere at the present day. The reason it is like this is that it has no affection for truth for its own sake, still less any affection for good motivated by good. Anything they think or say that 
is based on the Word or their religious teachings is due to habit followed since early childhood and to religious custom, and so is something external devoid of anything internal. </p>
<p></p>
<p><b>[2]</b>
 The fact that 
all aspects of the Hebrew Church, the one established at a later time among the descendants of Jacob, were an abomination to the Egyptians is evident not only from their refusal even to eat with them 
but also from the fact that sacrifices, in which the Hebrew Church made its main worship consist, were an abomination to them, as is evident in Moses, </p>
<blockquote>
Pharaoh said, Go away, sacrifice within the land. 
But Moses said, It is incorrect to do so, for we shall be sacrificing to Jehovah our God what is an abomination to the Egyptians; behold, if we sacrifice what is an abomination to the Egyptians in 
their eyes, will they not stone us? <a href="http://bible.gospelcom.net/cgi-bin/bible?passage=Exod%208:25,%2026&amp;version=ESV&amp;interface=print&amp;showfn=yes&amp;showxref">Exod 8:25, 26</a>. 
</blockquote>
<p>Also, feeding cattle and being a shepherd was an abomination to them, as is evident again in Moses,  </p>
<blockquote>
Every shepherd is an abomination to the 
Egyptians. <a href="http://bible.gospelcom.net/cgi-bin/bible?passage=Gen%2046:34&amp;version=ESV&amp;interface=print&amp;showfn=yes&amp;showxref">Gen 46:34</a>. 
</blockquote>
<p>Thus every aspect of that Church was an abomination to the Egyptians. The reason was that initially even the Egyptians had been among those who constituted the representative 
Ancient Church, <a href="1238.htm">1238</a>, <a href="2385.htm">2385</a>. But after that they rejected the God of the Ancient Church, who was Jehovah or the Lord, and served idols, in particular calves. Also the actual representatives and meaningful 
signs of the celestial and spiritual realities of the Ancient Church, which they came to know while part of that Church, were turned by them into magical practices. This being so, order with them 
became inverted, as a consequence of which everything constituting the Church was an abomination. </p>

`Quia abominatio id Aegyptiis': quod significet quod in opposito sint, constat ex repraesentatione `Aegyptiorum' quod sint qui in inverso ordine, n. 5700; et ex repraesentatione `Hebraeorum' cum quibus 
`comedere Aegyptiis fuit abominatio', quod sint qui in genuino ordine, n. 5701, ita inter se in opposito, inde aversatio et tandem abominatio.  Quod abominationem hanc attinet, sciendum quod qui in 
inverso ordine {1}sunt, hoc est, in malo et inde falso, ita tandem {2}aversantur bonum et verum Ecclesiae ut cum audiunt illud, et magis cum interiora eorum, adeo illa abominentur ut apud se nauseam 
{3}et vomitum quasi sentiant; hoc mihi dictum {4}et ostensum, cum miratus cur orbis Christianus interiora haec Verbi non recipiunt; apparuerunt spiritus e Christiano orbe, et coacti audire interiora 
Verbi, illi tali nausea correpti sunt ut dicerent se sentire quasi pruritum ad vomitum in se; et dictum quod talis sit orbis Christianus hodie fere ubivis; quod talis sit, {5} causa est quia in nulla 
affectione veri sunt propter verum, {6}minus in affectione boni {7}ex bono; quod ex Verbo aut ex doctrinali suo aliquid cogitent {8}et loquantur, est ex habitu ab infantia, et ex instituto ritu, {9}ita 
est externum absque interno.  [2](s)Quod omnia quae Ecclesiae {10}Hebraeae, quae dein instituta fuit apud posteros Jacobi, Aegyptiis abominatio fuerint, patet non solum ex eo quod ne quidem comedere 
cum illis vellent, sed etiam quod  sacrificia in quibus Ecclesia {11}Hebraea principalem suum cultum  ponebat, illis abominatio {12}fuerint, ut patet apud Mosen, 	{13}Pharaoh dixit, Abite, sacrificate 
in terra; verum dixit Moses, Non consultum est facere sic, quia abominationem Aegyptiorum sacrificabimus Jehovae, Deo nostro, ecce si sacrificemus abominationem Aegyptiorum in oculis eorum, nonne lapidabunt 
nos?, Exod. viii 21, 22 (A.V.25, 26); </p>
<p>tum quod {14} abominatio illis pascere pecudes, et pastor, ut quoque patet apud Mosen, 	Abominatio Aegyptiorum est omnis pastor gregis, Gen. xlvi 34; 
ita quaecumque fuerunt illius Ecclesiae, Aegyptii abominati sunt; causa erat quia primitus etiam Aegyptii inter illos qui Antiquam Ecclesiam repraesentativam constituerunt, fuerant, n. 1238, 2385, sed 
postmodum rejecerunt Deum Ecclesiae {15}Antiquae, hoc est, Jehovam seu Dominum, et idolis serviverunt, imprimis vitulis; tum ipsa repraesentativa et significativa caelestium et spiritualium Ecclesiae 
Antiquae, quae cum fuerunt ab Ecclesia {16}illa, hauserunt, verterunt in magica; inde illis inversus ordo, et consequenter omnium quae Ecclesiae, abominatio.(s) @1 after falso$ @2 abominentur$ @3
