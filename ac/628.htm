<h3 align="center" class="ired">属天的奥秘 第628节</h3>
<h4 align="center"></h4><p><strong>628.</strong>这段经文的内义是:教会所在之地的每个人，无论是谁，都“败坏了行为”，以致他不理解真理，因为人人都变成肉体的了，不但包括前节所论到的那些人，还包括本节，尤其下节所论到的那些被称为挪亚的人，因为他们在重生前也是这样的。之所以先提及这些事，是因为下面几节就论到他们的重生。而且，由于教会只剩下极少的人，故现在用的是“神”这个名，而不是“耶和华”。本节经文的意思是无丝毫真理存留，下节就说到无丝毫良善存留，除了存在于被称为“挪亚”之人所拥有的余留中的良善（因为没有余留就没有重生），以及他们所知道的教义之外。然而，对真理的觉知没有了，因为这觉知只存在于对良善的意愿所在之处。没有意愿，就没有觉知，意愿的性质决定了觉知的性质。绝大多数上古之人由于爱主而拥有对良善的意愿，并由此拥有对真理的觉知，但这觉知随同意愿一起完全消失了。尽管如此，某种理性真理和属世良善仍存留在那些被称为挪亚的人身上，所以，他们还能被重生。</p>

<p><strong>[NCE]628.</strong> The inner meaning here is that all people everywhere in the land — in the church's territory — had made their way corrupt, so that they did not comprehend truth, since all of them had turned their attention to the bodily plane. This included not only those mentioned in the last verse [<a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_628/bible_king-james-version_genesis_6_11" target=_top>Genesis 6:11</a>] but also those referred to as "Noah," specifically discussed both here and in the next verse. Before being reborn, they had the same character as the others. These details come first because the story of their rebirth waits till later [<a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_628/bible_king-james-version_genesis_8_15-22" target=_top>Genesis 8:15-22</a>]. And since little of the church remained, the name God rather than Jehovah is now being used.<br />The present verse signals the fact that nothing true had survived, and the next, that nothing good had. The only truth and goodness left was the remnant possessed by the people called "Noah," because without a remnant regeneration is impossible. The doctrinal concepts that they knew about also survived.<br />There was no comprehension of truth, however, because this is out of the question where no will to do good exists. When will is absent, so too is intellect, and the better or worse the will is, the better or worse the intellect. The earliest people had a will to do good because they loved the Lord, and from this they had a comprehension of truth. This ability to comprehend, though, was completely destroyed along with the will.<br />A glimmering of truth on the rational plane and a trace of goodness on the earthly plane did remain to the people called "Noah," and for this reason they were capable of rebirth. </p>

The internal sense here is that every man whatsoever, in the land where the church was, "had corrupted his way" so that he did not understand truth. For every man had become corporeal, not only those 
referred to in the preceding verse, but also those called "Noah" who are specifically treated of here and in the following verse, for such they were before they were regenerated. These things are said 
first, because in the following verses their regeneration is treated of. And because but little of the church remained, "God" is now named, not "Jehovah." In this verse is signified that there was nothing 
true, and in the following verse, that there was nothing good, except in the remains which they had who are called "Noah" (for without remains there is no regeneration), and also in the doctrinal 
matters that they knew. But there was no understanding of truth, as there never can be except where there is a will of good. Where the will is not, there is no understanding; and as the will is, such 
is the understanding. The most ancient people had a will of good, because they had love to the Lord; and from this they had an understanding of truth, but this understanding wholly perished with the 
will. A kind of rational truth however, as well as natural good, remained with those who are called "Noah" and therefore they could be regenerated. </p>

The internal sense here is this: Everybody on earth where the Church was, no matter who, had so 'corrupted his way' that he did not understand truth, for everybody had become bodily-minded. This included 
not only those dealt with in the previous verse, but also those called Noah who are dealt with in this verse and especially in the next; for before they had been regenerated they also were such. 
These details come first since the regeneration of these people is dealt with in what follows. Furthermore because little of the Church was left, the name 'God' is now used and not 'Jehovah'. That nothing 
true existed is the meaning of the present verse, nothing good the meaning of the next. These did not exist except in the remnants that resided with those called Noah - for without remnants regeneration 
cannot take place - and also in the matters of doctrine known to them. There was no understanding of truth however, for this never exists except where there is the will for good. When will is 
lacking so is understanding, and the character of the will determines that of the understanding. With the most ancient people a will for good was present on account of their love to the Lord, and from 
this came an understanding of truth. Here however the understanding together with the will has perished entirely. Nevertheless some truth of a rational kind, and natural goodness, remained with those 
called Noah. Consequently they were also able to be regenerated. </p>

</p><b>628.</b>
Sensus internus hic est quod omnis homo quicumque fuit in terra ubi Ecclesia, 'corruperit viam suam,' sic ut non intelligere verum, quia omnis homo corporeus factus; non solum illi de quibus in versu 
priore, sed etiam illi qui 'Noahus' dicuntur, de quibus hi' et in versu sequente in specie agitur; nam antequam regenerati, tales fuerunt; haec praecedunt quia de regeneratione eorum in sequentibus 
agitur: et quia parum Ecclesiae remansit, nunc dicitur 'Deus,' non Jehovah.  In hoc versu significatur quod nihil verum fuerit; in nunc sequente, quod nihil bonum; modo in reliquiis, quae apud hos qui 
'Noahus' vocantur, nam absque reliquiis, non datur regeneratio tum in doctrinalibus quae sciverunt: sed non fuit intellectus veri, qui nusquam datur nisi ubi voluntas boni; ubi non voluntas ibi nec intellectus, 
et qualis voluntas talis intellectus; apud antiquissimos fuit voluntas boni quia amor in Dominum, et inde intellectus veri; sed hic intellectus prorsus cum voluntate periit.  Verum quoddam 
rationale, et bonum naturale, remansit apud hos qui vocantur Noahus, quare etiam potuerunt regenerari. </p>
