<h3 align="center" class="ired">属天的奥秘 第2754节</h3>
<h4 align="center"></h4><p><strong>2754.</strong>最狡诈的灵人有时出现在头顶上方，但他们的地狱在脚后跟下面的深处。他们与那些洪水前的人一路货色，通过伪装纯真、怜悯、各种善情和说服来设圈套。他们在世时比起他人更是行淫者。哪里有漂亮的少妇，他们就往哪里去，毫无良心，并以这种手段诱奸她。他们是不可见的，也不愿被发现，因为他们暗中行事。他们也很残忍，只关心他们自己，即便整个世界因他们而灭亡，他们也不当回事。如今，这样的灵人大量存在，我被告知，他们来自基督教界。他们的地狱是最悲惨的那种。</p>

<p align="center"><b>Potts(1905-1910) 2754</b></p><p><b>2754.</b>
The most deceitful sometimes appear high above the head, but their hell is deep under the heel of the foot. They are the modern antediluvians. They ensnare by pretense of innocence, of pity, and of various 
good affections, with persuasion. When they lived in the world they were adulterers beyond others. Where there was a wife beautiful and young, there they entered without conscience and by such 
means seduced her. They are invisible and are unwilling to be discovered, as they act in secret. They are also cruel, having cared for themselves alone, and reckoning it as nothing even if the whole world 
should perish for them. There are great numbers of such spirits at this day, and it was said that they are from Christendom. Their hell is the most grievous of all. </p>

The most deceitful spirits sometimes appear high overhead, but their hell is deep down beneath the heel. They are the modem equivalents of those before the Flood. They entice by means of innocence, by 
means of mercy, and with persuasion by means of various good affections. When they lived in the world they were adulterers more than all others. Wherever there was a young and beautiful wife they went 
in without any conscience and by such means roused her to be wanton. They are invisible, nor do they wish to be exposed, for they act without being detected. They are also cruel, for they have studied 
only themselves and have considered it of no importance even if the whole world perished for them. Large numbers of such spirits exist at the present time, and I have been told that they come from 
Christendom. Their hell is the most oppressive of all. </p>

</p><b>2754.</b>
Dolosissimi apparent quandoque alte supra caput, sed infernum eorum est profunde sub calcaneo pedis, sunt hodierni antediluviani; per innocentiam insidiantur, per misericordiam, et per varias affectiones 
bonas cum persuasione; fuerunt dum vixerunt in mundo, adulteri prae aliis; ubi aliqua uxor pulchra et juvenis, absque conscientia intrarunt, et per illa commoverunt ad stuprum; sunt invisibiles, 
nec volunt detegi, quia agunt incognito; sunt quoque crudeles, sibi solis studuerunt, et pro nihilo reputaverunt, si vel universus mundus pro iis periisset: tales hodie sunt magno numero, (o)etiam dictum 
quod ex Christianismo: infernum eorum est omnium gravissimum. </p>
