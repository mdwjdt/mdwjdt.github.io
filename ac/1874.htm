<h3 align="center" class="ired">属天的奥秘 第1874节</h3>
<h4 align="center"></h4><p><strong>1874.</strong>在与善灵交谈时，我曾说过，圣言中的很多事物超出任何人的想象，它们是照着表象和感官幻觉来说的。如耶和华对恶人发怒、忿怒，发烈怒；又如祂以令他们毁灭、灭绝为乐，甚至杀害他们。这些事之所以在圣言中被提及，是为了人的信念和恶欲不被摧毁，而是被折向新的方向。若不以人能理解的方式，即通过表象、幻觉和信念来谈论这些事，而是以其它方式，就好象种子被播在水中，并且会立刻被拒绝。尽管如此，照着表象和幻觉所说的这些事仍能充当容纳属灵和属天之物的一般容器。万物皆源于主这一真理就能被引入它们里面；然后引入其中的真理是：主虽允许，但一切恶皆源于魔鬼灵；再后来引入的真理是：主规定并安排恶当转化为善；最后引入的真理是：从主所出的无非是善。字义就这样随着它的上升而逐渐消失，并变得属灵，然后变得属天，最后变成神性。</p>

<p><strong>[NCE]1874.</strong> In conversation with some good spirits I said that many statements in the Word (more than anyone could believe) are phrased to suit appearances and the illusions of the senses. For instance, the Word says that Jehovah feels anger, wrath, and fury against the ungodly, that he enjoys destroying and annihilating them, and even that he kills them. But these things are said in order to avoid shattering people's self-delusions and cravings, so as to bend them instead. To fail to speak in terms people grasp — in terms of appearances, fallacies, delusions — would be to sow seed on the water; it would be to say something that would immediately be rejected.<br />Still, those statements can serve as general containers for spiritual and heavenly ideas, because it is possible to inject certain notions into them. The first is that everything comes from the Lord; the next, that he allows things to happen but all evil comes from devilish spirits; then that the Lord provides and arranges for evil to be turned into good; and finally that nothing but good comes from the Lord. So the literal meaning disappears as it rises and turns spiritual and then heavenly and at last divine. </p>

In conversation with good spirits, I said that in the Word many things, even more than one can believe, are said according to appearances and according to the fallacies of the senses, as that Jehovah 
is in anger, wrath, and fury against the wicked; that He takes pleasure in bringing them to ruin and destruction, and even that He kills them. But these things have been said in order that persuasions 
and cupidities might not be broken, but that they might be bent; for to speak otherwise than as man apprehends (that is, from appearances, fallacies, and persuasions) would have been to sow seed in 
the waters, and to say that which would be at once rejected. Nevertheless such forms of speech are able to serve as general vessels in which spiritual and celestial things may be contained, for into them 
it may be insinuated that all things are from the Lord; then that the Lord permits, but that evil is wholly from diabolical spirits; afterwards that the Lord provides and disposes that evils should 
be turned into goods; and at last that nothing but good is from the Lord. Thus the sense of the letter perishes as it ascends and becomes spiritual, then celestial, and at last Divine. </p>

In conversations with good spirits I have said that many things in the Word, more than anyone may believe, have been stated according to appearances and according to the illusions of the senses - such 
as that Jehovah expresses anger, wrath, and rage against the wicked; that He takes delight in bringing them to destruction and annihilation; and even that He slays them. But the reason such things have 
been stated in the Word is so that people's persuasions and evil desires might not be destroyed but might be turned in a new direction. For to have spoken of things in a way other than man is able 
to grasp, that is, other than from appearances' illusions, and persuasions, would have been like sowing seed on the waters and would have been expressing that which would be instantly rejected. Nevertheless 
those things stated according to appearances and illusions are able to serve as general vessels in which spiritual and celestial things may be contained; for into them the truth may be introduced 
that all things derive from the Lord; then the truth that the Lord permits, but that all evil derives from devilish spirits; after that the truth that the Lord provides and arranges for evils to be 
converted into goods; and finally the truth that nothing but good comes from the Lord. Thus the sense of the letter perishes as it rises up, and becomes spiritual, then celestial, and finally Divine. </p>

</p><b>1874.</b>
Locutus cum spiritibus bonis, quod multa, et plura quam aliquis credere potest, in Verbo dicta sint secundum apparentias, et secundum fallacias sensuum, ut quod Jehovah in ira, excandescentia et furore 
sit contra impios, quod gaudeat ad perdendum et delendum eos, immo quod occidat; at dicta sunt ob causam ne frangerentur persuasiones et cupiditates sed ut flecterentur; nam loqui aliter ac homo capit, 
quod est ex apparentiis, fallaciis, et persuasionibus, fuisset serere semen in aquas, et dicere tale quod ilico rejiceretur: sed usque illa inservire possunt pro vasis communibus in quibus spiritualia 
et caelestia, nam illis insinuari potest quod omnia a Domino; dein quod permittat Dominus, sed quod omne malum a spiritibus diabolicis; postea quod Dominus provideat et disponat ut mala vertantur 
in bona; demum quod nihil nisi bonum a Domino; ita perit sensus litterae sicut ascendit, et fit spiritualis, dein caelestis, demum Divinus. </p>
