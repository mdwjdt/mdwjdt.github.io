Verses 4-9. When thou shalt meet thine enemy's ox, or his ass, going astray, bringing back thou shall bring it back to him. When thou shalt see the ass of him that hateth thee lying under his burden, 
and wouldest forbear to remove it for him, removing thou shalt remove it with him. Thou shalt not wrest the judgment of thy needy in his cause. Keep thee far from the word of a lie; and the innocent 
and the righteous slay thou not; for I will not justify the wicked. And thou shalt not take a present, because a present blindeth those who have their eyes open, and perverteth the words of the righteous. 
And a sojourner shalt thou not oppress; for ye know the soul of a sojourner, seeing that ye were sojourners in the land of Egypt. "When thou shalt meet thine enemy's ox, or his ass, going astray," 
signifies good not genuine and truth not genuine, with those who are outside the church; "bringing back thou shalt bring it back to him," signifies instruction and amendment; "when thou shalt see the 
ass of him that hateth thee lying under his burden," signifies falsity not agreeing with the good of the church, by reason of which they are about to perish; "and wouldest forbear to remove it for him," 
signifies no reception of truth; "removing thou shalt remove it with him," signifies nevertheless encouragement, and effort toward amendment; "thou shalt not wrest the judgment of thy needy in his 
cause," signifies no destruction of the scanty truth with those who are in ignorance; "keep thee far from the word of a lie," signifies an aversion for the falsity of evil; "and the innocent and the 
righteous slay thou not," signifies an aversion for destroying interior and exterior good; "for I will not justify the wicked," signifies that such malignity is contrary to the Divine righteousness; 
"and thou shalt not take a present," signifies an aversion for any self-advantage whatever; "because a present blindeth those who have their eyes open," signifies that matters of self-advantage cause 
truths not to appear; "and perverteth the words of the righteous," signifies so that [matters of self-advantage] appear like truths of good; "and a sojourner shalt thou not oppress," signifies that those 
who long to be instructed in the truths of the church must not be infested with evils of life; "for ye know the soul of a sojourner," signifies their longing and their life; "seeing that ye were sojourners 
in the land of Egypt," signifies that they were protected from falsities and evils when infested by the infernals. </p>

<p>'When you meet your enemy's ox or his ass going astray' means 
unauthentic good and unauthentic truth with those who are outside the Church. 'You shall surely bring it back to him' means teaching and correcting. 'When you see the ass of one who hates you lying under 
its burden' means falsity that does not accord with the Church's good, as a result of which they will perish. 'And you would cease from removing [it] for him' means not receiving truth. 'You shall 
surely remove [it] with him' means nevertheless exhorting and striving hard to correct. 'You shall not turn aside the judgement of your needy one in his dispute' means not destroying the small amount 
of truth with those lacking in knowledge. 'You shall keep yourself well away from the word of a lie' means detesting falsity arising from evil. 'And do not kill the innocent and the righteous' means 
detesting the destruction of good, interior and exterior. 'For I will not justify the wicked' means that such malevolence is contrary to Divine righteousness. 'And you shall not accept a gift' means detesting 
any kind of gain. 'For a gift blinds those whose eyes are open' means that gain prevents truths from being seen. 'And perverts the words of the righteous' means that it causes things which are 
seen to look like the truths of good. 'And a sojourner you shall not oppress' means that those with a desire to receive instruction in the Church's truths must not be molested with evils of life. 'And 
you know the soul of a sojourner' means their desire and life. 'For you were sojourners in the land of Egypt' means that they were protected from falsities and evils when they were molested by those 
from hell.

Vers. 4-9.  Cum occurreris bovi inimici tui, vel asino ejus, erranti, reducendo reduces eum illi.  Cum videris asinum osoris tui cubantem sub onere suo, et cessaveris a removendo ei, removendo removebis 
cum illo.  Non declinabis judicium egeni tui in lite ejus.  A verbo mendacii elongabis te, ac innocentem et justum ne occidas, quia non justificabo improbum. Et munus non accipies, quia munus occaecat 
apertos oculis, et pervertit verba justorum.  Et peregrinum non opprimes; et vos nostis animam peregrini, quia peregrini fuistis in terra Aegypti.  `Cum occurreris bovi inimici tui, vel asino ejus, 
erranti' significat bonum non genuinum et verum non genuinum apud illos qui extra Ecclesiam sunt: `reducendo reduces eum illi' significat instructionem et emendationem `cum videris asinum osoris tui 
cubantem sub onere suo' significat falsum non concordans cum bono Ecclesiae, ex quo perituri: `et cessaveris a removendo ei' significat non receptionem veri: `removendo removebis cum illo' significat 
usque hortationem et nisum emendationis: `non declinabis judicium egeni tui in lite ejus' significat non destructionem pauci veri apud illos qui in ignorantia: `a verbo mendacii elongabis te' significat 
aversationem (x)pro falso ex malo: `ac innocentem et justum ne occidas' significat aversationem pro destruendo bono interiore et exteriore: `quia non justificabo improbum' significat quod malignitas 
talis sit contra Divinam justitiam: {1} `et munus non accipies' significat aversationem pro lucro quocumque; `quia (x)munus occaecat apertos oculis' significat quod lucra faciant ut non appareant 
vera: `et pervertit verba justorum' significat ut appareant sicut vera boni: `et peregrinum non opprimes' significat quod qui desiderant instrui in veris Ecclesiae non infestandi malis vitae: `et vos 
nostis animam peregrini' significat desiderium illorum et vitam: `quia peregrini fuistis in terra Aegypti' significat {2}quod a falsis et malis tutati sint cum infestati ab infernalibus. @1 Deut. xvi 
19, 20 written beside this v., cp n. 9266$ @2 statum similem omnibus qui initiantur in Ecclesiam in principio but in n 9270 in A these same words are altered to those which appear in I in both places. 
cp also n. 9197$ </p>
