<h3 align="center" class="ired">属天的奥秘 第4539节</h3>
<h4 align="center"></h4><p><strong>4539.</strong>“起来，上伯特利去”表关于神性属世层，也就是说，关于它的觉知。这从“起来”、“上”和“伯特利”的含义清楚可知：“起来”是指提升（参看<a href="2401.htm">2401</a>，<a href="2785.htm">2785</a>，<a href="2912.htm">2912</a>，<a href="2927.htm">2927</a>，<a href="3171.htm">3171</a>，<a href="4103.htm">4103</a>节），在此是指属世层向着神性的提升；“上”是指朝向内层，如下文所述；“伯特利”是指属世层里面，也就是次序终端里面的神性（<a href="4089.htm">4089</a>节）。因为在原文，“伯特利”表示“神的殿或神的家”，并且由于“神的殿或神的家”就在对良善与真理的认知所存在之地，因此“伯特利”在最近似意义上表示这些认知，如前所示（<a href="1453.htm">1453</a>节）。但由于内层终止并被包裹于次序的终端，并一起在那里，可以说同住在一个家里；还由于人的属世层就是包裹他内层的终端，故严格来说，“伯特利”或“神的殿或神的家”就表示这属世层（<a href="3729.htm">3729</a>，<a href="4089.htm">4089</a>节），尤其表示那里的良善，因为就内义而言，“家或殿”表示良善（<a href="2233.htm">2233</a>，<a href="2234.htm">2234</a>，<a href="3720.htm">3720</a>，<a href="3729.htm">3729</a>节）。此外，认知存在于属世层或次序的终端里面。<br />“上”之所以表示朝向内层，是因为内层事物就是所谓的高层事物（<a href="2148.htm">2148</a>节），因此，当在内义上论述朝向内层事物的发展时，经上就用“上”这种词；如，从埃及“上”到迦南地；“上”到迦南地的内层部分；从迦南地的各个部分“上”到耶路撒冷；当在耶路撒冷本身时，就“上”到那里神的殿或家。摩西五经就提到从埃及“上”到迦南地：<br />法老对约瑟说，你可以上去埋葬你父亲；于是约瑟上去，与他一同上去的，有法老所有的臣仆；又有车辆马兵，和他一同上去。（创世记<a href="http://39-27.cn/创50.6.htm">50:6</a>，<a href="http://39-27.cn/创50.7.htm">7</a>，<a href="http://39-27.cn/创50.9.htm">9</a>）<br />士师记：<br />耶和华的使者从吉甲上到波金，他说，我使你们从埃及上来。（士师记<a href="http://39-27.cn/士2.1.htm">2:1</a>）<br />“埃及”在内义上表示帮助人们获得对属于主国度事物的某种概念的记忆知识；而“迦南地”表示主的国度。由于记忆知识较低，或也可说，是外层，而主国度的事物较高，或也可说，是内层，故圣言说“从埃及上迦南地”，反过来则说“从迦南地下埃及”（创世记<a href="http://39-27.cn/创42.2.htm">42:2</a>，<a href="http://39-27.cn/创42.3.htm">3</a>；<a href="http://39-27.cn/创43.4.htm">43:4</a>，<a href="http://39-27.cn/创43.5.htm">5</a>，<a href="http://39-27.cn/创43.15.htm">15</a>等）。<br />约书亚记提及“上”到迦南地本身的内层部分：<br />约书亚说，你们上去窥探那地；人就上去窥探艾城；他们回到约书亚那里，对他说，众民不必都上去；只要二千人或三千人上去；于是，民中约有三千人上那里去。（约书亚记<a href="http://39-27.cn/书7.2.htm">7:2</a>-<a href="http://39-27.cn/书7.4.htm">4</a>）<br />由于“迦南地”表示主的国度，故距离它的边境地区较为遥远的部分表示内层事物；因此，此处经上用的是动词“上去”。耶路撒冷周边所有区域，以及耶路撒冷中神的殿或家也一样（列王记上<a href="http://39-27.cn/王上12.27.htm">12:27</a>，<a href="http://39-27.cn/王上12.28.htm">28</a>；列王记下<a href="http://39-27.cn/王下20.5.htm">20:5</a>，<a href="http://39-27.cn/王下20.8.htm">8</a>；马太福音<a href="http://39-27.cn/太20.18.htm">20:18</a>；马可福音<a href="http://39-27.cn/可10.33.htm">10:33</a>；路加福音<a href="http://39-27.cn/路18.31.htm">18:31</a>；以及其它许多地方）。耶路撒冷是那地的至内在部分，因为它表示主的属灵国度；神的殿或家则是耶路撒冷的至内在部分，因为它表示主的属天国度，并在至高意义上表示主自己。这就是为何人们说“上”到这些地方。从这一切可以看出“起来，上伯特利去”表示什么，即朝向内层的发展，就是本章所论述的主题（<a href="4536.htm">4536</a>节）。</p>

Arise, go up to Bethel. That this signifies that the perception is concerning the Divine natural, is evident from the signification of "arising," as being elevation (see n. 2401, 2785, 2912, 2927, 3171, 
4103), here the elevation of the natural to the Divine; from the signification of "to go up," as being more toward the interiors (of which in what follows); and from the signification of "Bethel," 
as being the Divine in the natural, or in the ultimate of order (n. 4089). For in the original language "Bethel" means the "house of God," and as the house of God is where the knowledges of good and 
truth are, by "Bethel" in the proximate sense are signified these knowledges (as shown above, n. 1453). But as the interiors are terminated and closed in the ultimates of order, and are together there, 
and as it were dwell together in one house; and as the natural in man is the ultimate with him in which his interiors are terminated, therefore by "Bethel" or the "house of God" is properly signified 
the natural (n. 3729, 4089), and indeed the good therein, for in the internal sense a "house" is good (n. 2233, 2234, 3720, 3729); moreover knowledges are in the natural, or in the ultimate of order. [2] 
That "to go up" denotes toward the interiors is because interior things are what are called higher things (n. 2148), and therefore when progress toward interior things is treated of in the internal 
sense, the expression "to go up" is employed, as "to go up" from Egypt to the land of Canaan, and in the land of Canaan itself "to go up" to the interior parts, and from all parts of it to Jerusalem, 
and in Jerusalem itself to the house of God there. For example "to go up" from the land of Egypt to the land of Canaan, in Moses: </p>
<p>     Pharaoh said to Joseph, Go up and bury thy father; and Joseph 
went up, and all the servants of Pharaoh went up with him; and there went up with him both chariots and horsemen (Gen. 50:6, 7, 9). And in the book of Judges: </p>
<p>     And the angel of Jehovah went up 
from Gilgal to Bochim, and he said, I made you go up out of Egypt (Judg. 2:1); </p>
<p>for by "Egypt" in the internal sense is signified that memory-knowledge which is to serve for apprehending the things 
of the Lord's kingdom; and by the "land of Canaan" is signified the Lord's kingdom. And as memory-knowledges are lower, or what is the same, are exterior, and the things of the Lord's kingdom are higher, 
or what is the same, interior, therefore one is said "to go up from Egypt to the land of Canaan," and on the other hand "to go down from the land of Canaan to Egypt" (Gen. 42:2, 3; 43:4, 5, 15; and 
elsewhere). [3] In the land of Canaan itself "to go up" to its interior parts, in Joshua: </p>
<p>     Joshua said, Go up and spy out the land; and the men went up and spied out Ai; and they returned unto 
Joshua and said unto him, Let not all the people go up; let about two thousand men or about three thousand men go up; so there went up thither of the people about three thousand men (Josh. 7:2-4); </p>
<p>as 
the "land of Canaan" signifies the Lord's kingdom, the parts which were more remote from its ultimate boundaries signified things interior, and therefore the expression "to go up" is here used. In like 
manner from all the surrounding parts to Jerusalem; and in Jerusalem to the house of God (1 Kings 12:27, 28; 2 Kings 20:5, 8; Matt. 20:18; Mark 10:33; Luke 18:31; and in many other places). For Jerusalem 
was the inmost of the land, because by it was signified the Lord's spiritual kingdom; and the house of God was the inmost of Jerusalem, because by it was signified the Lord's celestial kingdom, 
and in the supreme sense the Lord Himself. Hence men spoke of "going up" to them. From all this it is evident what is signified by "arise, go up to Bethel," namely, progress toward the interiors, which 
is the subject treated of in this chapter (n. 4536). </p>

<p align="center"><b>Elliott(1983-1999) 4539</b></p><p><b>4539.</b>
'Rise up, go up to Bethel' means concerning the Divine Natural, that is to say, the perception concerning this. This is clear from the meaning of 'rising up' as implying some kind of raising up, dealt 
with in <a href="2401.htm">2401</a>, <a href="2785.htm">2785</a>, <a href="2912.htm">2912</a>, <a href="2927.htm">2927</a>, <a href="3171.htm">3171</a>, <a href="4103.htm">4103</a>, here a raising up of the Natural towards the Divine; from the meaning of 'going up' as doing so towards aspects even more interior, dealt with below; and 
from the meaning of 'Bethel' as the Divine within the natural, that is, within the ultimate degree of order, dealt with in <a href="4089.htm">4089</a>. In the original language Bethel means the house of God, and since 'the 
house of God' is a place where the cognitions of good and truth exist, 'Bethel' accordingly means, in the proximate sense, those cognitions, as shown in <a href="1453.htm">1453</a>. But because interior degrees are enveloped 
by and terminate in the parts which constitute the ultimate degree of order where they come together and so to speak inhabit the same house, and because man's natural is the ultimate degree, enveloping 
interior ones, 'Bethel' or the house of God therefore means, strictly speaking, the Natural, <a href="3729.htm">3729</a>, <a href="4089.htm">4089</a>, and in particular the good there. For 'a house' in the internal sense means good, <a href="2233.htm">2233</a>, <a href="2234.htm">2234</a>, <a href="3720.htm">3720</a>, <a href="3729.htm">3729</a>. It is also within the natural or the ultimate degree of order that cognitions exist. </p>
<p></p>
<p><b>[2]</b>
 The reason why 'going up' means a raising up towards more interior aspects is that things which 
are interior are spoken of as those that are higher, <a href="2148.htm">2148</a>, and therefore when the subject in the internal sense is an advance towards things that are more interior the expression 'going up' is used. 
Examples of this usage are, going up from Egypt to the land of Canaan; going up into the interior parts of the land of Canaan itself; going up from any part there to Jerusalem; and when in Jerusalem 
itself, going up to the house of God there. Going up from Egypt to the land of Canaan is referred to in Moses, </p>
<blockquote>
Pharaoh said to Joseph, Go up and bury your father. And Joseph went up. And there went 
up with him all Pharaoh's servants. And there went up with him chariot and horseman. <a href="http://bible.gospelcom.net/cgi-bin/bible?passage=Gen%2050:6-9&amp;version=ESV&amp;interface=print&amp;showfn=yes&amp;showxref">Gen 50:6-9</a>. 
</blockquote>
<p>And in the Book of Judges, </p>
<blockquote>
The angel of Jehovah went up from Gilgal to Bochim, and he said, I 
caused you to go up out of Egypt. <a href="http://bible.gospelcom.net/cgi-bin/bible?passage=Judg%202:1&amp;version=ESV&amp;interface=print&amp;showfn=yes&amp;showxref">Judg 2:1</a>. 
</blockquote>
<p>In the internal sense 'Egypt' means factual knowledge which helps people to have some conception of things belonging to the Lord's kingdom, while 'the land 
of Canaan' means the Lord's kingdom. And because facts are lower, or what amounts to the same, exterior, while things belonging to the Lord's kingdom are higher, or what amounts to the same, interior, 
the Word therefore speaks of 'going up' from Egypt to the land of Canaan, or - when travelling in the opposite direction - of 'going down' from the land of Canaan to Egypt, as in <a href="http://bible.gospelcom.net/cgi-bin/bible?passage=Gen%2042:2,%203;%2043:4&amp;version=ESV&amp;interface=print&amp;showfn=yes&amp;showxref">Gen 42:2, 3; 43:4</a>, 
<a href="5.htm">5</a>, <a href="15.htm">15</a>; and elsewhere </p>
<p></p>
<p><b>[3]</b>
 Going up into the interior parts of the land of Canaan itself is spoken of in Joshua, </p>
<p>Joshua said, Go up and spy out the land. And the men went up and spied out Ai, 
and they resumed to Joshua and said to him, Do not let all the people go up; let about <a href="2000.htm">2000</a> men or about <a href="3000.htm">3000</a> men go up. Therefore there went up of the people about <a href="3000.htm">3000</a> men. <a href="http://bible.gospelcom.net/cgi-bin/bible?passage=Josh%207:2-4&amp;version=ESV&amp;interface=print&amp;showfn=yes&amp;showxref">Josh 7:2-4</a>. </p>
<p>Because 'the 
land of Canaan' means the Lord's kingdom, parts further in from its border regions meant things that are interior; hence the use in this quotation of the verb 'to go up'. The same is true of Jerusalem 
in relation to all the regions surrounding it, and of the house of God in relation to Jerusalem within which it stood, <a href="1.htm">1</a> Kings 12:27, <a href="28.htm">28</a>; <a href="2.htm">2</a> Kings 20:5, <a href="8.htm">8</a>; Matt. 20:18; Mark 10:33; Luke 18:31; and 
in many other places besides these. For Jerusalem was the inmost part of the land because the Lord's spiritual kingdom was meant by it, and the house of God was the inmost part of Jerusalem because the 
Lord's celestial kingdom, and in the highest sense the Lord Himself were meant by it. This is why one speaks of 'going up' to these places. From all this one can see what is meant by 'rise up, go up 
to Bethel', namely that 'going up' means an advance towards things that are more interior, the subject dealt with in the present chapter, [see] <a href="4536.htm">4536</a>. </p>

`Surge, ascende Bethelem':  quod significet de Naturali Divino, nempe perceptionem, constat a significatione `surgere' quod involvat elevationem, de qua n. 2401, 2785, 2912, 2927, 3171, 4103; </p>
<p>hic elevationem 
Naturalis ad Divinum; ex significatione `ascendere' quod sit versus interiora magis, de qua sequitur; et ex significatione `Bethelis' quod sit Divinum in naturali, seu in ultimo ordinis, 
de qua n. 4089; Bethel enim in lingua originali significat domum Dei, et quia domus Dei est ubi cognitiones boni et veri, ita per `Bethelem' in proximo sensu significantur cognitiones illae, ut n. 
1453 ostensum est: at quia interiora terminantur et {1} finiuntur in ultimis {2} ordinis, et ibi simul sunt {3} et sicut in una domo cohabitant {4}, et quia naturale apud hominem est ultimum (o)apud 
hominem, in quo interiora terminantur, ideo per `Bethelem' seu domum Dei proprie significatur Naturale, n. 3729, 4089, et quidem bonum ibi, nam `domus' in sensu interno est bonum, n. 2233, 2234, 
3720, 3729; in naturali seu `in' ultimo ordinis etiam sunt cognitiones.  [2] Quod `ascendere' sit versus interiora, est quia interiora sunt quae dicuntur superiora, n. 2148, ideo cum agitur de progressu 
versus interiora in sensu interno {5}, dicitur `ascendere,' ut ab Aegypto ad terram Canaanem, in `ipsa' terra Canaane ad interiora {6}, et ibi ab undique ad Hierosolymam, inque ipsa {7} Hierosolyma 
ad domum Dei (o)ibi; ab Aegypto ad terram Canaanem, apud Mosen,           Pharaoh dixit ad Josephum, Ascende et sepeli patrem      tuum:... et ascendit Josephus;... et ascenderunt cum eo  
    omnes servi Pharaonis, ... et ascendit cum eo currus et      eques, Gen. l 6-9; (m)(o)et in Libro Judicum,           Ascendit angelus Jehovae ,ex Gilgal ad Bochim, et      dixit, Ascendere feci 
vos ex Aegypto, ii 1;(n) {8} per `Aegyptum' enim in sensu interno significatur scientificum, quod inserviturum capiendis illis quae regni Domini sunt, et per terram Canaanem {9} significatur regnum 
Domini, et quia scientifica sunt inferiora, seu quod idem, exteriora, et illa quae regni Domini, sunt superiora, seu quod idem, interiora {10}, idcirco dicitur ascendere ab Aegypto ad terram Canaanem; 
et `vicissim' a terra Canaane ad Aegyptum descendere, (o)ut Gen. xlii 2, 3; xliii 4, 5, 15, (o)et alibi.  [3] In ipsa terra Canaane ad {11} interiora ejus, apud {12} Joshuam,           Dixit 
Joshua, Ascendite et explorate terram; et      ascenderunt viri et explorarunt Aiam, et redierunt ad  Joshuam et dixerunt ad illum, Ne ascendat omnis populus,  quasi 2000 viri {13}, aut quasi 3000 
viri {13} ascendent     {14}:... quare ascenderunt de populo quasi 3000 viri {13},  vii 2-4; </p>
<p>quia `terra Canaan' significat regnum Domini, ideo illa quae a terminis ultimis remotiora essent, significabant 
interiora, inde dicitur hic `ascendere.'  Pariter a circuitibus ubivis ad Hierosolymam; et in Hierosolyma ad domum Dei, I Reg. xii 27, 28; 2 Reg. xx 5, 8; Matth. xx 18; Marc. x 33; Luc. xviii 
31, et pluries alibi; Hierosolyma enim erat intimum terrae, quia per illam significabatur regnum spirituale Domini, et domus Dei erat intimum Hierosolymae quia per illam significabatur regnum caeleste 
Domini, et in supremo sensu Ipse Dominus; inde ad illa dicitur `ascendere.'  Ex his patet quid per `surge, ascende Bethelem' significatur, quod nempe per `ascendere' progressio versus interiora,
