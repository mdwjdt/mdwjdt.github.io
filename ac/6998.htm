<h3 align="center" class="ired">属天的奥秘 第6998节</h3>
<h4 align="center"></h4><p><strong>6998.</strong>“说，不是有你的哥哥利未人亚伦吗”表良善与真理的教义。这从“亚伦”的代表清楚可知。“亚伦”是指主的神性良善或祂的祭司职分；但此处，在他承接祭司职分之前，是指良善与真理的教义；所以经上还说“他要为摩西当作口，摩西要为他当作神”；因为“摩西”代表直接从主发出的主的神性真理，因此“亚伦”代表间接从主发出的神性真理，这神性真理就是良善与真理的教义。“摩西”在此所代表的真理就是人无法听见或明白的真理（<a href="6982.htm">6982</a>节）；而“亚伦”所代表的真理则是人既能听见，也能明白的真理。这就是为何亚伦被称为“口”，摩西被称为“他的神”。这也解释了为何亚伦被称作“利未人”，因为“利未人”表示教会的良善与真理的教义，这些教义用于并服务祭司职分。</p>

And He said, Is there not Aaron thy brother the Levite? That this signifies the doctrine of good and truth, is evident from the representation of Aaron, as being the Lord as to Divine good or the priesthood; 
but here, before he was initiated into the priesthood, the doctrine of good and truth: and therefore also it is said that "he should be to Moses for a mouth, and Moses to him for God;" for by 
Moses is represented the Lord as to the Divine truth which proceeds immediately from the Lord; consequently by Aaron, the Divine truth which proceeds mediately from the Lord, and which is the doctrine 
of good and truth. That truth which Moses here represents is truth which cannot be heard or perceived by man (n. 6982); but the truth which Aaron represents is truth which can be both heard and perceived 
by man; hence Aaron is called the "mouth," and Moses his "God;" and hence Aaron is called a "Levite," for by a "Levite" is signified the doctrine of good and truth of the church, which ministers 
to and serves the priesthood. </p>

'And He said, Is there not Aaron your brother, the Levite?' means teachings that present what is good and true. This is clear from the representation of 'Aaron' as the Lord's Divine Goodness or His Priesthood; 
but here, before his introduction into the priesthood, he represents teachings that present what is good and true. This is also the reason why it says that he will be for Moses 'as a mouth', 
and Moses will be for him 'as a god'; for 'Moses' represents the Lord's Divine Truth as it goes forth directly from the Lord, and therefore 'Aaron' represents Divine Truth that goes forth from the Lord 
in an indirect way. And this truth consists in teachings that present what is good and true. The kind of truth that 'Moses' represents here is truth that a person is unable to hear or discern, <a href="6982.htm">6982</a>; 
but the kind of truth that 'Aaron' represents is truth he can hear and discern. This is why Aaron is called 'a mouth' and Moses is called 'his god'. It also explains why Aaron is referred to as 'the 
Levite', for Levite' means the Church's teachings presenting what is good and true, teachings which are of use and service to the priesthood.  </p>

</p><b>6998.</b>
`Et dixit, Annon Aharon frater tuus Levita?': quod significet doctrinam boni et veri, constat ex repraesentatione `Aharonis' quod sit Dominus quoad Divinum Bonum seu Sacerdotium; hic autem, antequam 
in sacerdotium initiatus est, est doctrina boni et veri; quapropter etiam dicitur quod `ille erit Moschi ad os, et Moscheh illi ad deum,' per `Moschen' enim repraesentatur Dominus quoad Divinum Verum 
quod immediate a Domino procedit, inde per `Aharonem' Divinum Verum quod mediate a Domino procedit, quod verum est doctrina boni et veri; illud verum quod `Moscheh' hic repraesentat est verum quod ab 
homine non audiri nec percipi potest, n. 6982, at verum quod `Aharon' repraesentat est verum quod ab homine et audiri et percipi potest; inde Aharon dicitur `os' et Moscheh `ejus deus'; et inde {1}Aharon 
dicitur `Levita,' nam per `Levitam' significatur doctrina {2}boni et veri Ecclesiae, quae sacerdotio ministrat et inservit. 	@1 vocatur$ 	@2 veri et boni$ </p>
