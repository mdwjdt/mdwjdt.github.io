<h4 align="center"></h4><p><strong>403.</strong>我们现在明白了“城”的含义。但由于创世记的所有这一部分都是历史体裁，所以对于那些局限于字义的人来说，似乎该隐真的建了一座城，并取名为以诺。甚至从字面上看，他们也必以为那地人口众多，尽管该隐只是亚当的头生子。但如前所述，上古之人习惯于将一切事物以具有代表性的类型整理成历史体裁，这是他们最大的乐趣，因为这使一切事物看上去富有活力。</p>

<p><strong>[NCE]403.</strong> This establishes the symbolism of a city. But because all the details have been linked into a story, people who concentrate on the literal meaning view it as saying simply that Cain built a city and called it Enoch. They can see nothing more in it even though the literal meaning also requires them to believe that the land was well populated, despite the fact that Cain was Adam's firstborn. This is the story line's necessary implication. As noted earlier [<a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_403/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_66" target=_top>66</a>], though, the custom of the earliest people was to express everything through representative images and weave them into a narrative. This custom gave them the greatest pleasure; it seemed to make everything come alive. </p>
<p align="center"><b>Potts(1905-1910) 403</b></p><p><b>403.</b>
We have now seen what a "city" signifies. But as all this part of Genesis is put into an historical form, to those who are in the sense of the letter it must seem that a city was built by Cain, and was 
called Enoch, although from the sense of the letter they must also suppose that the land was already populous, notwithstanding that Cain was only the firstborn of Adam. But as we observed above, the 
most ancient people were accustomed to arrange all things in the form of a history, under representative types, and this was to them delightful in the highest degree, for it made all things seem to be alive. </p>

<p align="center"><b>Elliott(1983-1999) 403</b></p><p><b>403.</b>
From these quotations it is clear what 'a city' means. But because everything is put together as history, what else can people who are confined to the sense of the letter see than the idea that Cain 
built a city and called it Enoch? Yet even they from the sense of the letter must suppose that the earth was already populated, notwithstanding what is said about Cain being Adam' s firstborn. The historical 
sequence of events implies this. But as stated already, it was the custom among the most ancient people to convert all things into representative types and then arrange them as history. And to 
them this was something supremely delightful. When they did this everything they saw was seemingly alive.  </p>

<p align="center"><b>Latin(1748-1756) 403</b>
</p><b>403.</b>
Ex his constat quid 'urbs' significat; sed quia historice omnia connexa sunt, non potest aliter videri ab iis qui in sensu litterae sunt quam quod a Caino aedificata sit urbs et vocata Hanoch, tametsi 
ex sensu litterae etiam sic putarent quod populosa esset terra, licet Cain primogenitus esset Adami; historica series hoc secum habet; sed ut prius dictum, antiquissimis mos erat omnia sub typis repraesentativis 
historice concinnare, quod illis summe delectabile fuit; tunc illis quasi omnia visa sunt vivere. </p>
