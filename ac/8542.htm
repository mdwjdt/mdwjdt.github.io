<h4 align="center"></h4><p><strong>8542.</strong>他们极其小心谨慎，防止任何人陷入对独一主的错误想法；若发现有人开始错误地思想主，他们先是警告他，然后发出威胁来制止他，最后诉诸惩罚。他们说，他们发现，若有任何这类反常想法潜入一个家庭，那么这个家庭就会从他们中间被除掉，不是通过他们的同伴所判的死刑被除掉，而是通过早已用死亡威胁他们的灵人剥夺呼吸，因而剥夺生命被除掉。因为在木星，灵人与人们交谈；如果他们作恶，或有作恶的企图，灵人就会惩罚他们（参看<a href="7801.htm">7801</a>-<a href="7812.htm">7812</a>节）。因此，他们若错误地思想独一主，就会受到死亡的威胁，除非他们悔改。对主，也就是他们的至高神性的敬拜，便以这种方式在那里被保存下来。</p>

The greatest care is taken that no one should fall into wrong opinions about the One Only Lord; and if they observe that anyone begins to think wrongly about Him, they first admonish him, then deter 
him by means of threats, and finally by means of punishments. They said that they have observed that if any such thing has crept into any family, that family is taken from among them, not by any death 
penalties inflicted by their companions, but by deprivation of breathing and consequently of life by spirits, after they have first been threatened with death. For on that earth spirits speak with the 
people, and chastise them if they have done evil, and also if they have intended to do evil (see n. 7801-7812); consequently if they think badly about the One Only Lord, they are threatened with death 
unless they repent. In this way the worship of the Lord, who to them is the supreme Divine, is preserved there. </p>

The greatest care is taken to prevent anyone from slipping into perverse ways of thinking about the one and only Lord. If they see that others are starting to think of Him wrongly they first of all warn 
them; after that they issue threats to check them, and finally they resort to punishments. They said they have noticed that if any such perversity creeps into a family, that family is removed from 
their midst, not by any death penalties administered by companions, but by being deprived of breath and therefore of life by spirits who have already threatened them with death. For on that planet spirits 
talk to people, chastizing them if they have done what is bad, and also if they have intended to do anything bad, <a href="7801.htm">7801</a>-<a href="7812.htm">7812</a>. Consequently if they think in a bad way about the one and only Lord, 
they are threatened with death if they do not come to their senses. This is the manner in which worship of the Lord, who for them is the Supreme Divine One, is preserved. </p>

Cavetur quam maxime ne aliquis labatur in pravas opiniones de unico Domino; et si animadvertunt quod aliqui incipiant de Ipso sinistre cogitare, primum {1}admonent illos, dein per minas, et tandem per 
poenas {2}absterrent; {3} dixerunt quod observaverint, si tale quid irrepit in aliquam familiam, quod illa tollatur e medio, non per aliquas poenas mortis a sodalibus, sed per privationem respirationis 
et inde vitae a spiritibus, postquam ii prius mortem illis denuntiaverunt; nam in illa tellure loquuntur spiritus cum illis, et castigant illos si malum fecerunt, et quoque si malum intenderunt facere, 
n. 7801-7812; inde si male cogitant de unico Domino, {4}si non resipiscunt, denuntiatur illis mors; hoc modo conservatur ibi cultus Domini, Qui illis est supremum Divinum. 	@1 admonentur A, admonent
