<h3 align="center" class="ired">属天的奥秘 第10188节</h3>
<h4 align="center"></h4><p><strong>10188</strong>.“要从坛边下面给它作两个金环”表神性良善的气场，结合和保存通过该气场得以实现。这从“两个”、“金”、“环”和“边”的含义清楚可知：“两个”是指结合（参看<a href="5194.htm">5194</a>，<a href="8423.htm">8423</a>节）；“环”是指一种神性气场（<a href="9498.htm">9498</a>，<a href="9501.htm">9501</a>节）；“金”是指良善（<a href="9874.htm">9874</a>，<a href="9881.htm">9881</a>节）；“边”是指一个边界，用来防止它们被邪恶靠近并伤害，如刚才所述（<a href="10187.htm">10187</a>节）。由此明显可知，“（坛）边下面两个金环”表示神性良善的气场，结合通过该气场得以实现。之所以也表示保存，是因为香坛是用穿环的杠子来抬的，而“抬”表示保存（<a href="9900.htm">9900</a>节）。<br />此处必须简要说明何为神性良善的气场。神性良善的气场充满整个天堂，还延伸到地狱；因为它就像世上太阳之热的气场，这热的气场在夏天甚至抵达没有太阳出现的黑暗地方。古人将这种神性气场称为放射光圈（circles of radiating light），神在它中间，天使则围绕它。因此，那些允许自己被主引导，因而从祂接受神性的人根据他们对神性的接受程度而在神性良善的气场之内。而那些不接受它的人的确也在这个气场之内，但他们的内层被如此关闭，以致他们感觉不到它的流注。因为那些在地狱里的人都将注意力集中在外在事物上，而不是集中在内在事物上。此外，邪恶和衍生的虚假从这些外在事物中散发出来，在他们周围出现时看似从火炉冒出来的烟，使得神性良善的外在气场昏暗、失效，而它的内在气场仍然存在。但他们不接受这个气场，因为它已经向他们关闭，但主仍通过它统治地狱。<br />之所以有一个从主发出的神性良善的气场，是因为天堂的太阳，就是主，是神性之爱本身；事实上，这爱就是如此显现的。它所发出的热是爱之良善，而它所发出的光是信之真理。这就是为何在圣言中，“太阳”表示神的爱，它的火和热表示爱之良善，它的光则表示信之真理。<br />此外，从每位天使那里也发出一个来自其爱的气场，良善或邪恶同样照着每个灵人的爱从他那里发出；但从他们那里发出的气场不会延伸得太远。而神性气场则延伸到整个宇宙万物，因为它从至内在之物发出，而至内在之物是依次从它出来的事物的全部中的全部。关于这些气场，可参看前面的说明，部分还通过经历说明（<a href="1048.htm">1048</a>，<a href="1053.htm">1053</a>，<a href="1316.htm">1316</a>，<a href="1504.htm">1504</a>-<a href="1512.htm">1512</a>，<a href="1695.htm">1695</a>，<a href="2401.htm">2401</a>，<a href="4464.htm">4464</a>，<a href="5179.htm">5179</a>，<a href="6206.htm">6206</a>e，<a href="7454.htm">7454</a>，<a href="6598.htm">6598</a>-<a href="6613.htm">6613</a>，<a href="8063.htm">8063</a>，<a href="8630.htm">8630</a>，<a href="8794.htm">8794</a>，<a href="8797.htm">8797</a>，<a href="9490.htm">9490</a>-<a href="9492.htm">9492</a>，<a href="9498.htm">9498</a>，<a href="9499.htm">9499</a>，<a href="9534.htm">9534</a>，<a href="9606.htm">9606</a>，<a href="9607.htm">9607</a>节）。</p>

And thou shalt make for it two rings of gold from under its border. That this signifies the sphere of Divine good, through which are conjunction and preservation, is evident from the signification of 
"two," as being conjunction (see n. 5194, 8423); from the signification of "gold," as being good (n. 9874, 9881); and from the signification of a "border," as being a bounding to prevent their being 
approached and injured by evils (of which just above, n. 10187). From all this it is evident that by "two rings of gold from under the border" is signified the sphere of Divine good through which is conjunction; 
and that preservation also is signified, is because the altar of incense was carried by staves inserted in the rings, and by "carrying" is signified preservation (n. 9900). [2] What the sphere 
of Divine good is shall here be briefly told. The sphere of Divine good fills the universal heaven, and also extends itself into hell, for it is like the sphere of the sun's heat in the world, which 
in summer penetrates even into dark places where the sun does not appear. This Divine sphere was likened by the ancients to radiant circles in the midst of which was God, and round about were angels. 
Accordingly those who suffer themselves to be led by the Lord, thus who receive the Divine from Him, are in the sphere of Divine good in proportion to their reception of it; while those who do not 
receive it are indeed in the same sphere, but their interiors have been so much closed up that they do not feel the influx. For those who are in hell are in externals and are not in internals, and from 
their externals there exhale evils and the derivative falsities, which appear around them like the smoke from a furnace; causing the external sphere of Divine good to be dulled there, while the internal 
sphere of it still remains; but it is not received because it has been closed to them; nevertheless the Lord rules the hells by means of it. [3] The reason why there is a sphere of Divine good 
which proceeds from the Lord, is because the Sun of heaven, which is the Lord, is Divine love itself, for this so appears; the heat thence proceeding is the good of love, and the light thence proceeding 
is the truth of faith; hence in the Word by the "sun" is meant the Divine love; by "fire," and "heat," the good of love; and by "light," the truth of faith. [4] Moreover, from every angel proceeds 
a sphere from his love, also from every spirit good and evil according to his love; but the spheres proceeding from these do not extend themselves far, whereas the Divine sphere extends through the 
universe, for it proceeds from the inmost, and the inmost is the all in all the things that follow in succession from it. (Concerning these spheres, see what has already been shown, partly also from experience, 
n. 1048, 1053, 1316, 1504-1512, 1695, 2401, 4464, 5179, 6206, 7454, 6598-6613, 8063, 8630, 8794, 8797, 9490-9492, 9498, 9499, 9534, 9606, 9607.) </p>

'And two rings of gold you shall make for it under the rim' means the sphere of Divine Good by means of which a joining together and preservation are effected. This is clear from the meaning of 'two' 
as a joining together, dealt with in <a href="5194.htm">5194</a>, <a href="8423.htm">8423</a>; from the meaning of 'rings' as a Divine sphere, dealt with in <a href="9498.htm">9498</a>, <a href="9501.htm">9501</a>; from the meaning of 'gold' as good, dealt with in <a href="9874.htm">9874</a>, <a href="9881.htm">9881</a>; and from the meaning 
of 'the rim' as a border serving to defend from the approach of evils and the harm these can do, dealt with immediately above in <a href="10187.htm">10187</a>. From these meanings it is evident that 'two rings of gold 
under the rim' means the sphere of Divine Good by means of which a joining together is effected. The reason why a preservation is also meant is that the poles were inserted into the rings and then served 
to carry [the altar], and 'carrying' means preserving, <a href="9900.htm">9900</a>.  </p>
<p></p>
<p><b>[2]</b>
 What the sphere of Divine Good is must be stated briefly here. The sphere of Divine Good fills the whole of heaven, and also extends 
into hell; for it is like the sphere of the sun's heat in the world, which in summer reaches even into dark places where the sun does not appear. That Divine sphere was likened by the ancients 
to circles of radiating light which had God in the middle of them and angels round about. Those therefore who allow themselves to be led by the Lord, and so who receive what is Divine from Him, are in 
the sphere of Divine Good, to the extent that they are receptive. Those however who are not receptive are, it is true, in that same sphere; but their interiors are closed off, to such an extent that 
they are insensitive to its influx. For the attention of those in hell is fixed on things of an external nature and not on those of an internal nature. From these external things furthermore evils and 
consequent falsities emanate, which as they appear around those spirits look like a pall of smoke from a furnace. As a consequence of this the external sphere of Divine Good there loses its effectiveness, 
while the internal sphere nevertheless remains. Though they are unreceptive of this sphere because the way for it to come in has been closed, the Lord nevertheless rules the hells by means of it. 
 </p>
<p></p>
<p><b>[3]</b>
 The reason why it is the sphere of Divine Good that emanates from the Lord is that the Sun of heaven, which is the Lord, is God's love; for that is how this love manifests itself there. The 
heat radiating from it is the good of love, while the light radiating from it is the truth of faith. This is why in the Word the sun is used to mean God's love, its fire and heat being the good of love, 
and its light the truth of faith.  </p>
<p></p>
<p><b>[4]</b>
 Furthermore from each individual angel there emanates a sphere from his love, as there does also from each good or bad spirit, in keeping with their loves, 
though the spheres emanating from them do not extend very far. But the Divine sphere extends through all creation, for it emanates from what is inmost, and what is inmost is the all in all of the things 
that go out in order from it.  </p>

`Et duos annulos auri facies ei desub limbo': quod significet sphaeram Divini Boni, per quam conjunctio et conservatio, constat ex significatione `duorum' quod sint conjunctio, de qua n. 5194, 8423, 
ex significatione `annulorum' quod sint sphaera Divina, de qua n. 9498, 9501, ex significatione `auri' quod sit bonum, de qua n. 9874, 9881, et ex significatione `limbi' quod sit terminatio ne adeantur 
et laedantur a malis, de qua mox supra n. 10,187; ex his patet quod per `duos annulos auri desub limbo' significetur sphaera Divini Boni per quam conjunctio; quod etiam significetur conservatio, est 
quia per vectes annulis insertos portabatur et per `portare' significatur conservatio, n. 9900. 	[2] Quid sphaera Divini Boni hic paucis dicetur: sphaera Divini Boni implet universum caelum, et quoque 
extendit se in infernum, nam se habet illa sicut sphaera caloris solis in mundo, qui in aestate penetrat etiam in loca tenebrosa ubi non apparet sol; sphaera illa Divina ab antiquis assimilata est 
circulis radiosis in quorum medio Deus, et circumcirca angeli; qui itaque se duci patiuntur a Domino, ita qui recipiunt Divinum ab Ipso, tantum in sphaera Divini Boni sunt quantum recipiunt; qui autem 
non recipiunt, quidem in eadem sphaera sunt, sed tantum interiora apud illos occlusa sunt, ut non sentiant influxum; {1}nam qui in {2}inferno sunt, in externis {3}sunt et non in internis; exhalant etiam 
ab externis eorum mala et inde falsa, quae apparent circum illos sicut fumosum ex fornace, inde sphaera Divini Boni externa ibi hebetatur, remanente usque interna, quae non recipitur, quia pro illa 
clausum est, sed usque Dominus per illam regit inferna. Quod sphaera Divini Boni sit quae procedit a Domino, est quia Sol [3] caeli, qui est Dominus, est ipse amor Divinus, nam hic ita apparet; calor 
inde procedens est bonum amoris, et lux (d)inde procedens est verum fidei; inde in Verbo per solem {4}intelligitur amor Divinus, per ignem et calorem bonum amoris, et per lucem verum fidei. 	[4] 
Praeterea ab unoquovis angelo procedit sphaera ex amore ejus, etiam ex quovis spiritu bono et malo secundum eorum amores; sed sphaerae ex illis procedentes non longe se extendunt; sphaera autem Divina 
in universum, nam ex intimo procedit, et intimum est omne in omnibus quae {5} inde succedunt; de sphaeris illis videantur quae prius partim etiam ab experientia ostensa sunt, n. 1048, 1053, 1316, 1504-1512,
