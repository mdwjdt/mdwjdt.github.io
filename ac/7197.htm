<h3 align="center" class="ired">属天的奥秘 第7197节</h3>
<h4 align="center"></h4><p><strong>7197.</strong>“就是他们所寄居的寄居之地”表信与仁的事物所在之地，他们已经接受关于这些事物的教导，并照之生活。这从“地”和“寄居”的含义清楚可知：“地”是指主在天上和地上的国度，如刚才所述（<a href="7196.htm">7196</a>节），因而也指主国度的事物，众所周知，这些事物就是信与仁（因此，当主题是“寄居”所表示的教导和生活时，这些也由“迦南地”来表示）；“寄居”是指教导和生活（<a href="1463.htm">1463</a>，<a href="2025.htm">2025</a>，<a href="3672.htm">3672</a>节）。由此明显可知，“他们所寄居的寄居之地”表示信与仁的事物所在之地，他们已经接受关于这些事物的教导，并照之生活。此中情形是这样：在来世，天堂照各人里面的信与仁的事物而赐给各人，因为仁与信构成每个人的天堂；但当说仁与信构成天堂时，意思是说仁与信的生活。然而，要充分认识到，含有天堂在里面的生活是照着一个人被教导的信之真理与良善所过的生活。除非它们成为他生活的准则和标准，否则，他仰望天堂也是枉然，无论他如何生活。因为没有这些真理与良善，人就像随风摇动的芦苇；事实上，他既受善人驱使，同样受恶人驱使，因为他根本没有在自己里面牢固建立真理或良善，以使得天使能用来把他保持在真理与良善中，并引导他远离来自地狱的人不断引入的虚假与邪恶。简言之，构成天堂的，是基督教徒的良善的生活，而非属世良善的生活。</p>

The land of their sojournings, wherein they sojourned. That this signifies where the things of faith and charity are, about which they have been instructed, and according to which they have lived, is 
evident from the signification of "land," as being the Lord's kingdom in the heavens and on earth (of which just above, n. 7196), thus also the things of the Lord's kingdom, which, it is known, are faith 
and charity, and therefore these also are signified by the "land of Canaan" where the subject treated of is the instruction and life which are signified by "sojourning;" and from the signification 
of "sojourning," as being instruction and life (n. 1463, 2025, 3672). From this it is evident that by "the land of their sojournings wherein they sojourned" is signified where the things of faith and 
charity are, about which they have been instructed and according to which they have lived. The case herein is this. In the other life heaven is given to everyone in accordance with the things of faith 
and charity in him, for charity and faith make heaven with everyone; but when it is said that charity and faith make heaven, there is meant the life of charity and faith. But note well that the life 
which has heaven in it, is a life according to the truths and goods of faith about which the man has been instructed. Unless these are the rules and principles of his life, in vain does he look for 
heaven, no matter how he has lived; for without these truths and goods a man is like a reed which is shaken by every wind; for he is bent by evils equally as by goods, because he has nothing of truth 
and good made firm within him, whereby he may be kept by the angels in truths and goods, and be withdrawn from the falsities and evils which the infernals are continually injecting. In a word, the life 
of Christian good is what makes heaven; not a life of natural good. </p>

'The land of their sojournings in which they sojourned' means where those things reside that are aspects of faith and charity in which they have received instruction and which they have practised in 
life. This is clear from the meaning of 'the land' as the Lord's kingdom in heaven and on earth, dealt with immediately above in <a href="7196.htm">7196</a>, and so too the things that belong to the Lord's kingdom, which, it 
is well known, are faith and charity (these too are therefore meant by 'the land of Canaan when the subject is instruction and life, meant by 'sojourning'); and from the meaning of 'sojourning' as instruction 
and life, dealt with in <a href="1463.htm">1463</a>, <a href="2015.htm">2015</a>, <a href="3672.htm">3672</a>. From this it is evident that 'the land of their sojournings in which they sojourned' means where those things reside that are aspects of faith and 
charity in which they have received instruction and which they have practised in life. The implications of all this are that heaven is given to each person in the next life in the measure that aspects 
of faith and charity reside with him; for charity and faith compose heaven with everyone, though when it is said that charity and faith compose heaven this means a life of charity and faith. Yet it should 
be fully recognized that the life which holds heaven within it is a life led in conformity with those truths and forms of the good of faith which a person has been taught about. Unless they are 
the rules and standards of his life his expectation of heaven is in vain, no matter how he has lived. Without them a person is like a reed which sways with every wind, for he is moved equally by those 
who are evil as by those who are good. This is because he has no firmly established truth or good at all within himself which the angels can use to maintain him in truths and forms of good, and to steer 
him away from the falsities and evils constantly introduced by those from hell. In short, a life of Christian goodness is what composes heaven, not a life of natural goodness. </p>

</p><b>7197.</b>
`Terram peregrinationum illorum, in qua peregrinati sunt': quod significet ubi illa quae fidei et charitatis, de quibus instructi sunt et secundum quae vixerunt, constat ex significatione `terrae' quod 
sit regnum Domini in caelis et in terris, de qua mox supra n. 7196, ita quoque quae sunt regni Domini, quae quod sint fides et charitas, notum est; inde quoque haec, ubi de instructione et vita, quae 
{1}significantur per `peregrinari,' agitur, per `terram Canaanem' significantur; et ex significatione `peregrinari' quod {2}sit instructio et vita, de qua n. 1463, 2025, (x)3672; inde patet quod per 
`terram peregrinationum illorum, in qua peregrinati sunt' significetur ubi illa quae fidei et charitatis, de quibus instructi sunt et secundum quae vixerunt.  Cum his ita se habet: cuique in altera 
vita datur caelum secundum illa quae fidei et charitatis sunt apud illum, nam charitas et fides faciunt caelum apud unumquemvis; sed cum dicitur quod charitas et fides faciant caelum, intelligitur vita 
charitatis et fidei; at probe sciendum quod vita cui caelum, sit vita secundum vera et bona fidei, de quibus instructus est homo; nisi illa sint normae et principia vitae ejus, frustra exspectat caelum 
utcumque vixerit; absque illis enim est homo (x)sicut arundo qui secundum omnem ventum nutat, {3}nam flectitur a malis aeque ac a bonis, {4}quia nihil veri et boni habet apud se firmatum, per quod 
ab angelis teneri possit in veris (o)et bonis, et abduci a falsis et malis quae infernales continuo injiciunt; verbo, vita boni Christiani {5}est quae facit caelum, non vita boni naturalis. 	@1 significatur$ 	@2
