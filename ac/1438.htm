<h3 align="center" class="ired">属天的奥秘 第1438节</h3>
<h4 align="center"></h4><p><strong>1438.</strong>“他们就到了迦南地”表祂获得了爱的属天事物。这从刚才有关迦南地的说明清楚可知。此处描述了自出生到童年这段时期主生命中的第一件事，即祂获得了爱的属天事物。爱的属天事物是本质本身，其余的皆出自它们。祂首先充满属天事物，因为后来的所有事物都通过这些事物如同通过它们的种那样变得丰盛。主里面的种本身是属天的，因为祂是从耶和华生的。因此，祂是里面有这种的独一无二的那一位。其他所有人都只有污秽的地狱之种，无一例外。他们的自我就在于并来自这种；众所周知，这是从父亲那里遗传来的；所以，他们若不从主那里接受一个新种子和一个新自我，即一个新意愿和一个新理解力，必然沦落地狱。主将所有人、灵人和天使从地狱拉出来，并不断拦阻他们。</p><br />

<p><strong>[NCE]1438.</strong> The fact that and they came into the land of Canaan means that he arrived at the heavenly aspects of love is established by the remarks just made about the land of Canaan. This passage describes how the Lord in his early life 钬?specifically from birth to adolescence 钬?arrived at the heavenly aspects of love.<br />The heavenly aspects of love are the true essentials; everything else develops out of them. These were the first things of all to be instilled in the Lord, because everything else then germinated from them like plants sprouting from their seed. In the Lord, because he was born of Jehovah, the seed itself was heavenly. For the same reason, he was the only being in whom this seed was ever sown.<br />No humans that have ever lived have any other seed sown in them than some foul, hellish germ that is the carrier and source of their selfhood; and this they inherit from their father, as everyone knows. So unless we receive from the Lord a new seed and new selfhood, that is, a new will and a new intellect, we are inevitably doomed to hell. Hell is what we must be withdrawn and constantly withheld from by the Lord, and this means all of us: people on earth, spirits, and angels. </p>
<p align="center"><b>Potts(1905-1910) 1438</b></p><p><b>1438.</b>
And into the land of Canaan they came. That this signifies that He attained to the celestial things of love, is evident from what has just been said concerning the land of Canaan. There is here described 
the first thing in the Lord's life-from birth to childhood-namely, that He attained to the celestial things of love. The celestial things of love are the very essentials; the rest come from them. 
With these He was first of all imbued; for from these as from their seed were all things afterwards made fruitful. The seed itself in Him was celestial, because He was born of Jehovah; and therefore 
He was the only one who had this seed in Himself. All men whatever have no other seed than something filthy and infernal, in and from which is what is their own; and this is from what is inherited from 
the father, as is known to everyone; wherefore, unless they receive from the Lord a new seed and a new Own, that is, a new will and a new understanding, they cannot be otherwise than accursed to hell; 
from which all men, spirits, and angels, are drawn forth, and are continually withheld by the Lord. </p>

<p align="center"><b>Elliott(1983-1999) 1438</b></p><p><b>1438.</b>
'And they came into the land of Canaan' means that He attained to the celestial things of love This is clear from what has just been stated about the land of Canaan Here the Lord's life at first is described, 
that is to say, from birth to childhood, during which period He attained to the celestial things of love. The celestial things of love are the essentials themselves, and everything else comes 
from these. It was with celestial things that He was endowed first of all, for it was from these as from its seed that all else was then made fruitful. With Him the seed itself was celestial, for He 
was born from Jehovah, and therefore He alone has had that seed within Himself All others, without exception, have no other seed than what is filthy and of hell, in which their proprium consists and 
from which it is derived; and this comes with that which is inherited from the father, as is well known to everyone. Consequently unless they receive from the Lord a new seed and a new proprium, that 
is, a new will and a new understanding, they are inevitably consigned to hell, a place from which all, not only men but also spirits and angels, are being pulled out and constantly withheld by the Lord. </p>

</p><b>1438.</b>
'Et venerunt in terram Canaan':  quod significet quod ad caelestia amoris pervenit, constat ex illis quae nunc dicta sunt de terra Canaane; hic describitur primum vita Domini nempe a nativitate usque 
ad pueritiam, quod nempe pervenerit ad caelestia amoris:  caelestia amoris sunt ipsa essentialia, cetera inde veniunt:  illis omnium primo imbutus est, nam inde dein ut a suo semine fructificata sunt 
omnia; ipsum semen fuit apud Ipsum caeleste, quia natus a Jehovah, inde solus fuit qui in se habuit hoc semen; omnes quotcumque sunt, homines non aliud semen habent quam quoddam spurcum et infernale, 
in quo et ex quo proprium eorum, et hoc ex hereditario a patre, quod cuivis notum est; quare nisi novum semen, et novum proprium, hoc est, novam voluntatem et novum intellectum accipiunt a Domino, non 
possunt aliter quam esse devoti inferno; a quo omnes tam homines quam spiritus et angeli extrahuntur, et continue detinentur a Domino. </p>
