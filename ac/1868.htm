<h3 align="center" class="ired">属天的奥秘 第1868节</h3>
<h4 align="center"></h4><p><strong>1868.</strong>要通过圣言证实这些民族表示这些事物太过冗长，而且也没有必要，因为此处只提到了它们的名字。其中一些民族在前面已有论述，如“利乏音人”表谬念（<a href="567.htm">567</a>，<a href="581.htm">581</a>，<a href="1673.htm">1673</a>节）；“亚摩利人”表邪恶（<a href="1680.htm">1680</a>节）；“迦南人”表邪恶（15:16）；“比利洗人”表虚假（<a href="1574.htm">1574</a>节）。至于其它民族的具体含义，蒙主怜悯，等到后面它们出现时再予以解释。<br />关于被逐出主国度的这些民族，情况乃是这样：在来世，邪恶的魔鬼灵只渴望浮到灵人界骚扰善灵，但每次都被逐出。在一个正经历重生的人里面，占据他的恶与假差不多也是这样被征服和驱散，然后主国度的善与真取而代之，被植入进来。<br />这些虚假和邪恶由被雅各的后代逐出迦南地的民族来代表，也由后来被逐出这地的犹太人自己来代表。同样的情形也出现在古时代表类似事物的很多其它民族身上，如被以扫的子孙赶出西珥山的何利人（申命记<a href="http://39-27.cn/申2.12.htm">2:12</a>，<a href="http://39-27.cn/申2.22.htm">22</a>）；被迦斐托人逐出的亚卫人（申命记<a href="http://39-27.cn/申2.23.htm">2:23</a>）；还有被摩押人逐出的以米人或利乏音人（申命记<a href="http://39-27.cn/申2.9.htm">2:9</a>-<a href="http://39-27.cn/申2.11.htm">11</a>）；以及被亚扪人逐出的散送冥人（申命记<a href="http://39-27.cn/申2.19.htm">2:19</a>-<a href="http://39-27.cn/申2.21.htm">21</a>）；除此之外，先知书中还提及很多其它民族。</p>

<p><strong>[NCE]1868.</strong> It would take too long to prove from the Word at this point that these nations symbolize such things, and there is no need to do it here, since the nations are merely named. Some of them have been discussed before. It was noted at <a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_1868/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_567" target=_top>567</a>, <a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_1868/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_581" target=_top>581</a>, <a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_1868/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_1673" target=_top>1673</a>, for instance, that the Rephaim symbolize persuasive lies; at <a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_1868/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_1680" target=_top>1680</a> that an Amorite symbolizes evil; above at verse <a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_1868/bible_king-james-version_genesis_15_16" target=_top>16</a> that a Canaanite symbolizes evil [<a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_1868/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_1857" target=_top>1857:1</a>]; and at <a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_1868/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_1574" target=_top>1574</a> that a Perizzite symbolizes falsity. The specific symbolism of the other nations will be described later, by the Lord's divine mercy, where they come up.{*1} [2] In regard to the "nations" that need to be banished from the Lord's kingdom, the case is this: In the other world, evil, diabolical spirits crave nothing more than to go up into the world of spirits and plague good spirits. But every time they do, they are thrown out. It is the same as in people who are regenerating: the falsity and evil that have taken possession of them are subdued and scattered and are replaced with the truth and goodness that belong to the Lord's kingdom. These evil influences were represented by the nations that the children of Jacob expelled from the land of Canaan, and likewise by the Jews themselves, who were driven out later.{*2} [3] The same thing happened at one time to many other nations that represented similar influences. These included the Horites, driven from Mount Seir by Esau's descendants (as told in <a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_1868/bible_king-james-version_deuteronomy_2_12" target=_top>Deuteronomy 2:12</a>, <a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_1868/bible_king-james-version_deuteronomy_2_22" target=_top>22</a>); the Avvim, driven off by the Caphtorim (as told in <a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_1868/bible_king-james-version_deuteronomy_2_23" target=_top>Deuteronomy 2:23</a>); the Emim or Rephaim, driven off by the Moabites (as told in <a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_1868/bible_king-james-version_deuteronomy_2_9" target=_top>Deuteronomy 2:9</a>, <a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_1868/bible_king-james-version_deuteronomy_2_10" target=_top>10</a>, <a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_1868/bible_king-james-version_deuteronomy_2_11" target=_top>11</a>); the Zamzummim, by the Ammonites (as told in <a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_1868/bible_king-james-version_deuteronomy_2_19" target=_top>Deuteronomy 2:19</a>, <a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_1868/bible_king-james-version_deuteronomy_2_20" target=_top>20</a>, <a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_1868/bible_king-james-version_deuteronomy_2_21" target=_top>21</a>); and many others mentioned in the prophets.{*3} Sacred Scripture, or the Word (Continued)<br /><br /><strong>Footnotes:</strong><br />{*1} Kadmonites are not mentioned anywhere else in Scripture. Kenites and Kenizzites are mentioned in Numbers, Joshua, Judges, 1 Samuel, and 1 Chronicles; but Secrets of Heaven, which does not extend beyond Exodus, does not treat the inner meaning of these people. For the symbolism of Hittites, see <a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_1868/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_289" target=_top>289</a>, <a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_1868/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_1203#subsection-2-2" target=_top>1203:2</a>, <a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_1868/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_2913" target=_top>2913</a>, <a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_1868/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_3470" target=_top>3470:1</a>, <a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_1868/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_6858" target=_top>6858</a>.

Swedenborg explains the symbolism of Girgashites in the previous section. [LHC]<br />{*2} For a list of the nations that the Israelites were commanded to expel from the land of Canaan, see <a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_1868/bible_king-james-version_deuteronomy_7_1" target=_top>Deuteronomy 7:1</a>; <a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_1868/bible_king-james-version_joshua_3_10" target=_top>Joshua 3:10</a>; the biblical account records, however, that not all members of all those nations were expelled (<a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_1868/bible_king-james-version_1-kings_9_20-21" target=_top>1 Kings 9:20-21</a>). The expulsion of the Jews from Palestine occurred through three major events: 1. the destruction of the northern kingdom of Israel by the Assyrians in 722 b.c.e., as a result of which the inhabitants were dispersed throughout the Middle East and absorbed into local populations (these are the "Ten Lost Tribes of Israel;" see <a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_1868/bible_king-james-version_2-kings_17_8-23" target=_top>2 Kings 17:8-23</a>); 2. the relocation of much of the population of the southern kingdom of Judah to Babylon under the Babylonian king Nebuchadnezzar in 587-586 b.c.e. (a number of these displaced persons were allowed to return by the Persian king Cyrus in 538 b.c.e. following his conquest of Babylon; see <a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_1868/bible_king-james-version_2-kings_17_1-41" target=_top>2 Kings 17</a>; <a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_1868/bible_king-james-version_2-chronicles_36_5-23" target=_top>2 Chronicles 36:5-23</a>; <a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_1868/bible_king-james-version_ezra_1_1-11" target=_top>Ezra 1</a>); and 3. the expulsion of practically the entire population of Judea by the Romans following the Jewish War of 66-73 c.e. After this point there was only an extremely small Jewish population in Palestine until the twentieth century.

That these things are signified by these nations it would be too tedious to confirm from the Word; and there is no need to do so here, because they are merely named. Some of them have been treated of 
above; the "Rephaim" as signifying the persuasions of falsity (n. 567, 581, 1673); the "Amorite" as signifying evils (n. 1680); the "Canaanite" as signifying evils (above at verse 16); the "Perizzite" 
as signifying falsities (n. 1574). What is the specific signification of the other nations, shall of the Lord's Divine mercy be told in what follows, as they occur.  [2] As regards the nations which 
are to be expelled from the Lord's kingdom, the case is this. In the other life the evil and diabolical spirits desire nothing more than to come up into the world of spirits and infest the good spirits, 
but as often as they do so they are cast out, in like manner as in a man who is being regenerated the falsities and evils which have taken possession of him are subjugated and dissipated, and the 
goods and truths of the Lord's kingdom are implanted in their place.  [3] These were represented by the nations that were expelled from the land of Canaan by the sons of Jacob; and the same were represented 
by the Jews themselves, who were afterwards expelled from the land. The same occurred with many nations of old that represented similar things, as the Horites who were driven from Mount Seir 
by the descendants of Esau (spoken of in Deut. 2:12, 22); and the Avvim who were expelled by the Caphtorim (mentioned in Deut. 2:23); also the Emim or Rephaim who were driven out by the Moabites (spoken 
of in Deut. 2:9-11); and also the Zamzummim who were expelled by the Ammonites (mentioned in Deut. 2:19-21); besides many others spoken of in the Prophets. </p>

That these things are meant by these nations would take too long to confirm from the Word; nor is there any need to do so here as no more than their names are mentioned. Some of them have been dealt 
with already, for example that 'the Rephaim' means false persuasions, <a href="567.htm">567</a>, <a href="581.htm">581</a>, <a href="1673.htm">1673</a>; 'the Amorites' evils, <a href="1680.htm">1680</a>; 'the Canaanites' evils, above at verse 16; 'the Perizzites' falsities, <a href="1574.htm">1574</a>. What the 
rest of the nations mean individually will in the Lord's Divine mercy be explained as they occur later on. </p>
<p></p>
<p><b>[2]</b>
 As regards the nations that were to be cast out of the Lord's kingdom, in the next life 
evil and devilish spirits like nothing more than to surface in the world of spirits and to infest good spirits. But as often as they do so they are cast out, in much the same way as the falsities and 
evils that have taken possession of one who is being regenerated are overpowered and dispersed, and in their place truths and goods are implanted that belong to the Lord's kingdom. </p>
<p></p>
<p><b>[3]</b>
 These falsities 
and evils were represented by the nations that were driven out of the land of Canaan by the descendants of Jacob. They were represented as well by the Jews themselves who at a later period were 
driven out from there. The same occurred with many other nations of old by whom similar things had been represented, such as the Horites who were driven from Mount Seir by the descendants of Esau, mentioned 
in <a href="http://bible.gospelcom.net/cgi-bin/bible?passage=Deut%202:12,%2022&amp;version=ESV&amp;interface=print&amp;showfn=yes&amp;showxref">Deut 2:12, 22</a>; then the Avim who were driven out by the Kaphtorim, mentioned in <a href="http://bible.gospelcom.net/cgi-bin/bible?passage=Deut%202:23&amp;version=ESV&amp;interface=print&amp;showfn=yes&amp;showxref">Deut 2:23</a>; also the Emim or Rephaim who were driven out by the Moabites, mentioned in <a href="http://bible.gospelcom.net/cgi-bin/bible?passage=Deut%202:9-11&amp;version=ESV&amp;interface=print&amp;showfn=yes&amp;showxref">Deut 2:9-11</a>; as well 
as the Zamzummim who were driven out by the Ammonites, mentioned in <a href="http://bible.gospelcom.net/cgi-bin/bible?passage=Deut%202:19-21&amp;version=ESV&amp;interface=print&amp;showfn=yes&amp;showxref">Deut 2:19-21</a>; besides many others referred to in the Prophets. </p>

Quod haec per gentes illas significentur, nimis prolixum foret ex Verbo nunc confirmare, et hic non opus quia solum nominantur; de quibusdam actum est prius, ut de Rephaim quod significent persuasiones 
falsi, n. 567, 581, 1673; de Emorita quod mala, n. 1680; de Canaanita quod mala, supra ad vers. 16; de Perizzita quod falsa, n. 1574; quid reliquae gentes significent in specie, in sequentibus, ex 
Divina Domini Misericordia, ubi occurrunt, dicetur.  [2] Quod gentes attinet quae expellendae e regno Domini, ita se res habet: in altera vita spiritus mali et diabolici nihil plus cupiunt quam subire 
in mundum spirituum et infestare bonos spiritus, sed toties ejiciuntur; similiter ac apud hominem qui regeneratur, falsa et mala quae occuparunt illum, subjugantur et dissipantur, et loco eorum vera 
et bona quae sunt regni Domini, implantantur; [3] haec repraesentata fuerunt per 'gentes quae expulsae sunt a filiis Jacobi e terra Canaane'; pariter per ipsos Judaeos qui inde dein expulsi; similiter 
factum cum pluribus gentibus olim, per quas similia repraesentata sunt, ut per Horitas qui expulsi e monte Seir ab Esavi posteris, de quibus Deut. ii 12, 22; et per Avaeos qui expulsi a Caphtoraeis, 
de quibus Deut. ii 23; tum per Enim aut Rephaim, qui expulsi a Moabitis de quibus Deut. ii 9-11, ut et per Zamzumim ab Ammonitis, de quibus Deut. ii 19-21; praeter per alios plures, de quibus apud Prophetas. </p>
