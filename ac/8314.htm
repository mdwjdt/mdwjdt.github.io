<h3 align="center" class="ired">属天的奥秘 第8314节</h3>
<h4 align="center"></h4><p><strong>8314.</strong>“那时，以东的族长惊惶”表那些由于自我之爱而过着邪恶生活之人的类似感觉。这从“族长”的含义和“以东”的代表清楚可知：“族长”（经上或译首领）是指领袖，因而是指所有和每个人，如下文所述；“以东”是指那些出于自我之爱的邪恶抓住虚假，弃绝真理的人，在从人抽象出来的意义上是指接受虚假、弃绝真理的自我之爱的邪恶，因此“以东”也代表那些过着由这爱，即自我之爱所生的邪恶生活的人。至于“族长”这个词，它表示领袖；在从人抽象出来的意义上是指首要事物，因而是指所有和每个方面。因为当经上提到“族长（或首领）”这个词时，它暗含了在他们之下的每一个和一切人，如当经上提到“王”这个词时，它暗含了其王国的一切臣民；这个群体的名字是从他们当中最有权柄的人那里得来的。当圣言提到“族长”时，所表示的是总体事物，其它一切事物，或首要事物在这些总体事物之下，如“三级兵长”（<a href="8150.htm">8150</a>，<a href="8276.htm">8276</a>节）；这个词论及良善，在反面意义上论及邪恶。“首领”也表示总体事物，其它事物，或首要事物在这些总体事物之下（<a href="1482.htm">1482</a>，<a href="2089.htm">2089</a>，<a href="5044.htm">5044</a>节），但这个词论及真理。<br />要知道，圣言中有些词属于属灵事物那一类，有些词属于属天事物那一类；也就是说，有些词用来表述诸如属于真理或信仰的那类事物，有些词用来表述诸如属于良善或爱的那类事物。还有些词论及这二者。知道这些事的人一看见或阅读圣言，尤其圣言的原文，就能知道就内义而言，哪里论述的是诸如属于真理的那类事物，哪里论述的是诸如属于良善的那类事物。“族长”和“首领”的情况是这样：“首领”（princes）表示首要事物，论及信之真理；而“族长”（chiefs）表示首要事物，论及爱之良善。就反面意义而言，“首领”论及信之虚假，“族长”论及爱之邪恶。<br />正因如此，那些在以东掌权的人称作“族长”（创世记<a href="http://39-27.cn/创36.15.htm">36:15</a>-<a href="http://39-27.cn/创36.21.htm">21</a>，<a href="http://39-27.cn/创36.29.htm">29</a>，<a href="http://39-27.cn/创36.30.htm">30</a>，<a href="http://39-27.cn/创36.40.htm">40</a>-<a href="http://39-27.cn/创36.43.htm">43</a>）。原因在于，“以东”表示属天之爱的良善，在反面意义上表示自我之爱的邪恶。但在以实玛利的子孙当中，那些被授权管理其他人的人不是称作“族长”，而是称作首领（创世记<a href="http://39-27.cn/创25.16.htm">25:16</a>），因为“以实玛利”表示那些处于真理的人（<a href="3263.htm">3263</a>，<a href="3268.htm">3268</a>，<a href="4747.htm">4747</a>节）。由于同样的原因，那些在以色列掌权的人也称作“首领”（民数记<a href="http://39-27.cn/民7.2.htm">7:2</a>，<a href="http://39-27.cn/民7.10.htm">10</a>，<a href="http://39-27.cn/民7.18.htm">18</a>，<a href="http://39-27.cn/民7.24.htm">24</a>，<a href="http://39-27.cn/民7.30.htm">30</a>，<a href="http://39-27.cn/民7.36.htm">36</a>，<a href="http://39-27.cn/民7.42.htm">42</a>，<a href="http://39-27.cn/民7.48.htm">48</a>，<a href="http://39-27.cn/民7.54.htm">54</a>），因为“以实玛利”代表那些处于信之真理和良善的人。但那些在犹大掌权的人称作“族长”，因为“犹大”代表那些处于爱之良善的人，如在撒迦利亚书：<br />让他在犹大像族长。（撒迦利亚书<a href="http://39-27.cn/亚9.7.htm">9:7</a>）<br /><br />犹大的族长必心里说，我要为自己使耶路撒冷的居民倚靠万军之耶和华他们的神；那日，我必使犹大的族长如火炉在木柴中。（撒迦利亚书<a href="http://39-27.cn/亚12.5.htm">12:5</a>，<a href="http://39-27.cn/亚12.6.htm">6</a>）</p>

Then were the chiefs of Edom dismayed. That this signifies the like with those who are in a life of evil from the love of self, is evident from the signification of "the chiefs," as being the principal 
ones, thus all and each (of which below); and from the representation of Edom, as being those who from the evil of the love of self readily learn falsities and reject truths, and in the sense abstracted 
from person, as being the evil of the love of self to which falsity is adjoined and from which truth is rejected, thus also those who are in a life of evil from this love, namely, from the love 
of self. As regards these "chiefs," by them are signified the principal ones; in the sense abstracted from person, the principal things, thus all things and each; for when "the chiefs" are mentioned, 
general things are signified, under which are the rest, or the principal things; as for instance the "tertian captains" (n. 8150, 8276); and they are predicated of good, and in the opposite sense of evil; 
while by "princes" are also signified general things under which are the rest, or primary things (n. 1482, 2089, 5044), but these are predicated of truth. [2] Be it known that in the Word there 
are words that belong to the class of spiritual things, and words that belong to the class of celestial things; that is, there are those which express such things as belong to truth or faith, and those 
which express such things as belong to good or love. There are also words which are predicated of both. He who knows these things can know from the first view or reading of the Word, especially in its 
original tongue, where in the internal sense it treats of such things as are of truth, or of such things as are of good. The case is so with the signification of "princes," and of "chiefs;" "princes" 
signify primary things, and are predicated of the truths of faith; but "chiefs" signify principal things, and are predicated of the good of love. In the opposite sense, "princes" are predicated of 
the falsities of faith, and "chiefs" of the evils of love. [3] From this it is that those who reigned in Edom were called "chiefs" (Gen. 36:15-21, 29, 30, 40-43). The reason is that by "Edom" was signified 
the good of celestial love, and in the opposite sense the evil of the love of self; but with the sons of Ishmael, those who presided over the rest were not called "chiefs," but "princes" (Gen. 
25:16), because by "Ishmael" were signified those who are in truth (n. 3263, 3268, 4747). For this reason also those were called "princes" who presided in Israel (Num. 7:2, 10, 18, 24, 30, 36, 42, 48, 
54), for by Israel were represented those who are in the truth and good of faith. But those who presided over Judah were called "chiefs," because by Judah were represented those who are in the good of 
love, as in Zechariah: </p>
<p>     Let him be as a chief in Judah (9:7).      The chiefs of Judah shall say in their heart, I will confirm to me the inhabitants of Jerusalem in Jehovah Zebaoth their God; 
in that day I will make the chiefs of Judah like a furnace of fire in pieces of wood (12:5, 6). </p>

<p align="center"><b>Elliott(1983-1999) 8314</b></p><p><b>8314.</b>
'Then the chiefs of Edom were dismayed' means a like feeling on the part of those leading a life of evil arising from self-love. This is clear from the meaning of 'the chiefs' as the leaders, thus each 
and every person, dealt with below; and from the representation of 'Edom' as those who, ruled by the evil of self-love, seize on falsities and cast aside truths, or as - in the sense abstracted from 
persons - the evil of self-love which embraces falsity and rejects truth, so that 'Edom' also represents those who lead a life of evil arising from that love, namely self-love. As regards the word 'chiefs', 
leaders are meant by it, or - in the sense abstracted from persons - leading features, and so each and every aspect. For when the word 'chiefs' is used, it implies each and every person under 
them, as when the word 'king' is used it implies all subjects of his kingdom; for the group takes its name from the most powerful person among them. When the term 'chiefs' or 'commanders' is mentioned 
in the Word general headings under which all else comes is meant, or leading features, as with 'tertiary commanders', <a href="8150.htm">8150</a>, <a href="8276.htm">8276</a>; and that term has reference to good, or in the contrary sense to evil. 
'Princes' however likewise means general headings under which all else comes, or first and foremost features, <a href="1482.htm">1482</a>, <a href="2089.htm">2089</a>, <a href="5044.htm">5044</a>; but it has reference to truth. </p>
<p></p>
<p><b>[2]</b>
 It should be recognized that in 
the Word there are terms that belong to the group of spiritual things and terms that belong to the group of celestial things; that is, there are terms serving to express such things as are matters of 
truth or faith, and terms serving to express such things as are matters of good or love. In addition there are terms that have reference to both. As soon as the person who is acquainted with these looks 
at or reads the Word, especially in its original language, he knows when such things as are matters of truth are the subject in the internal sense, and when such things as are matters of good are 
the subject. This is the situation with the meaning of 'princes' and 'chiefs'. 'Princes' means first and foremost features and is used in reference to the truths of faith, or in the contrary sense to 
falsities of faith, whereas 'chiefs' means leading features and is used in reference to the good of love, or in the contrary sense to the evils of love. </p>
<p></p>
<p><b>[3]</b>
 So it is that those who ruled in Edom were 
called 'chiefs', as is evident from <a href="http://bible.gospelcom.net/cgi-bin/bible?passage=Gen%2036:15-19,%2021,%2029,%2030,%2040-43&amp;version=ESV&amp;interface=print&amp;showfn=yes&amp;showxref">Gen 36:15-19, 21, 29, 30, 40-43</a>. The reason why they were called 'chiefs' is that 'Edom' meant the good of celestial love, and in the contrary sense the evil of 
self-love. But among 'the sons of Ishmael', those who were set in authority over everyone else were not called 'chiefs' but 'princes', <a href="http://bible.gospelcom.net/cgi-bin/bible?passage=Gen%2025:16&amp;version=ESV&amp;interface=print&amp;showfn=yes&amp;showxref">Gen 25:16</a>, because 'Ishmael' means those guided by truth, <a href="3263.htm">3263</a>, <a href="3268.htm">3268</a>, <a href="4747.htm">4747</a>. For the same reason the term 'princes' was used for those set in authority in Israel, <a href="http://bible.gospelcom.net/cgi-bin/bible?passage=Num%207:2,%2010,%2018,%2024,%2030,%2036,%2042,%2048,%2054&amp;version=ESV&amp;interface=print&amp;showfn=yes&amp;showxref">Num 7:2, 10, 18, 24, 30, 36, 42, 48, 54</a>, since 'Israel' represented those governed by the truth and 
good of faith. But those set in authority in Judah were called 'chiefs' since Judah' represented those governed by the good of love, as in Zechariah, </p>
<blockquote>
Let him be like a chief in Judah. <a href="http://bible.gospelcom.net/cgi-bin/bible?passage=Zech%209:7&amp;version=ESV&amp;interface=print&amp;showfn=yes&amp;showxref">Zech 9:7</a>. 
</blockquote>
<p>And 
in the same prophet, </p>
<blockquote>
The chiefs of Judah will say in their heart, I will strengthen<A name="fntext1"></a><A href="#fn1"><sup>a</sup></a> for myself the inhabitants of Jerusalem in Jehovah Zebaoth, their God. On that day I will make the chiefs of 
Judah like a furnace of fire among pieces of wood. <a href="http://bible.gospelcom.net/cgi-bin/bible?passage=Zech%2012:5,%206&amp;version=ESV&amp;interface=print&amp;showfn=yes&amp;showxref">Zech 12:5, 6</a>.

`Tunc consternati sunt duces Edomi': quod significet simile apud illos qui in vita mali ex amore sui, constat ex significatione `ducum' quod sint praecipui, ita omnes et singuli, de qua sequitur; et 
ex repraesentatione `Edomi' quod sint qui ex malo amoris sui arripiunt falsa et rejiciunt vera; in sensu a persona abstracto, quod {1}sit malum amoris sui cui adjungitur falsum et rejicitur verum; ita 
quoque qui in vita mali ex illo amore sunt, nempe ex amore sui.  Quod `duces' attinet, significantur per illos praecipui, in sensu a persona abstracto, praecipua, ita omnia et singula, nam cum duces 
nominantur, intelliguntur omnes et singuli qui sub illis, sicut cum rex, intelliguntur illius regni omnes, nam denominatio fit a potiore; ubi `duces' in Verbo nominantur, significantur communia sub quibus 
reliqua, seu praecipua, sicut duces tertiani, n. 8150, 8276, et praedicantur de bono, ac in opposito sensu de malo; per `principes' autem significantur etiam communia sub quibus reliqua, seu primaria, 
n. 1482, 2089, 5044, sed praedicantur de vero; sciendum quod in 2 Verbo sint voces quae ad classem spiritualium pertinent, et quae ad classem caelestium, hoc est, quae exprimunt talia quae sunt 
veri seu fidei, et quae talia quae sunt boni seu amoris; etiam sunt voces quae praedicantur de utrisque; qui haec novit, (d)is potest ex prima intuitione {2}seu lectione Verbi, imprimis in lingua ejus 
originali, scire ubinam in sensu interno agitur de talibus quae sunt veri, aut de talibus quae sunt boni; ita se habet cum significatione `principum et ducum': `principes' significant primaria, et praedicantur 
de fidei veris, at `duces' significant praecipua, et praedicantur de amoris bono, in opposito sensu {3}principes de fidei falsis, et {4}duces de amoris {5}malis; inde est quod qui in Edomo 
regnarunt dicti sint `duces,' ut patet 3 a Gen. xxxvi 15-19, 21, 29, 30, 40-43; causa est quia per `Edomum' significatum est bonum amoris caelestis, et in opposito sensu malum amoris sui; at apud filios 
Ismaelis, qui reliquis praefuerunt, non dicti sunt `duces' sed `principes,' Gen. xxv 16, quia per `Ismaelem' significati sunt qui in vero, n. 3263, 3268, 4747; ex illa causa etiam principes dicebantur 
qui praeerant {6}in Israele, Num. vii 2, 10, 18, 24, 30, (x)36, 42, 48, 54, nam per `Israelem' repraesentabantur qui in vero et bono fidei, at qui praeerant Jehudae dicebantur {7}`duces', quia per 
`Jehudam' repraesentabantur qui in bono amoris, ut apud Sachariam, Sit sicut dux in Jehudah, ix 7: </p>
<p>et apud eundem, Dicent duces Jehudae in corde suo, Confirmabo mihi habitatores Hierosolymae in Jehovah
