<h3 align="center" class="ired">属天的奥秘 第1402节</h3>
<h4 align="center"></h4><p><strong>1402.</strong>所讲述的有关亚伯兰寄居在埃及的事代表和表示主第一次接受的教导。“亚伯兰”是指主；作为妻子的“撒莱”是指要与属天事物联结的真理；作为妹子的“撒莱”是指理性真理；“埃及”是指记忆知识。从记忆知识发展到属天真理，这样的描述符合神序（Divine order），以便主的人性本质能与祂的神性本质融合，同时能成为耶和华。<br />内义</p><br />

<p><strong>[NCE]1402.</strong> Everything said about Abram's stay in Egypt represents and symbolizes the Lord's early education. Abram is the Lord; Sarai as his wife is truth that needs to be connected to something from heaven; Sarai as his sister is intuitive truth;{*1} and Egypt is secular knowledge.<br />The chapter describes the Lord's progress from superficial facts all the way to heavenly truth. This progression followed the divine plan calling for the Lord's human quality to be united with his divine quality and for the Lord to become at the same time Jehovah.<br /><br /><strong>Footnotes:</strong><br />{*1} The Latin phrase here translated "intuitive truth" is verum intellectuale, literally, "intellectual truth." In 搂<a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_1402/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_1496" target=_top>1496</a> Swedenborg defines this as truth united to an inner perception that a thing is so. "Intellect" in this usage is a higher faculty, which, though we cannot even consciously access it, is yet capable of recognizing truth by "perception" 钬?an intuitive linking of acquired knowledge with the fundamental premises of divine order. In 搂<a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_1402/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_1904#subsection-2-3" target=_top>1904:3-4</a> Swedenborg says, "When we think on our own (as we seem to do), we cannot possibly think on the basis of verum intellectuale, but only on the basis of rational and factual truth, because these appear to be ours. Only the Lord based his thinking on verum intellectuale when he lived in the world." And later (搂<a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_1402/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_2053" target=_top>2053:1</a>), on the same theme: "In human beings, there is no pure form of verum intellectuale, or in other words, divine truth. The religious truth we have is only apparent truth. Illusions of the senses attach themselves to it, and distortions urged by our selfish and materialistic cravings attach themselves to the illusions." There may be a connection between the intellect in this sense and the "pure intellect," a concept found in an unpublished work from Swedenborg's pretheological period, Draft of a Rational Psychology (Swedenborg 2001) 搂搂123-139. For example, the pure intellect is said not to "perceive anything as plausible or probable, but either as true or as false ... and this without a posteriori demonstration from effects, experience, artificial logic, and the scholastic sciences" (Draft of a Rational Psychology [Swedenborg 2001] 搂133). This seems very much like the sort of intellect Swedenborg is describing here in his discussion of <a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_1402/bible_king-james-version_genesis_12_1-20" target=_top>Genesis 12</a>. An intellectual truth, then, is one that can be verified only by the principles inherent in the higher intellect. This meaning parallels the use of the term that is common in Scholastic philosophy, according to which "We are enjoying intellectus [intellect] when we 钬榡ust see' a self-evident truth; we are exercising ratio [reason] when we proceed step by step to prove a truth which is not self-evident" (Lewis 1964, 157). For further argument in favor of the identity of the pure intellect and the intellect of verum intellectuale, see de Charms 1952, 381-383; for the opposing view, see Pitcairn 1952, 374-378, and Odhner 1952, 379-381. See note 3 in 搂<a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_1402/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_30" target=_top>30</a>, on the concept of the intellect in a broader sense.

The things told of Abram's sojourn in Egypt represent and signify the Lord's first instruction. "Abram" is the Lord; "Sarai," as a wife, is truth to be adjoined to the celestial; "Sarai," as a sister, 
is intellectual truth; "Egypt" is memory-knowledge [scientia]. The progress from memory-knowledges [a scientificis] even to celestial truths is described; this was according to Divine order, that the 
Lord's Human Essence might be conjoined with His Divine Essence, and at the same time become Jehovah. </p>

<p align="center"><b>Elliott(1983-1999) 1402</b></p><p><b>1402.</b>
The things that are stated regarding Abram's sojourn in Egypt represent and mean the instruction which the Lord received first, 'Abram' being the Lord, 'Sarai as a wife' truth that was to be allied to 
the celestial, 'Sarai as a sister' intellectual truth, and 'Egypt' knowledge. An advance from factual knowledge right on to celestial truths is described, which was made in accordance with Divine order, 
to the end that the Lord's Human Essence might be joined to the Divine Essence, and at the same time become Jehovah. </p>

</p><b>1402.</b>
Quae dicuntur de peregrinatione Abrami in Aegypto, repraesentant et significant Domini instructionem primam; 'Abram' est Dominus; 'Sarai ut uxor' est verum adjungendum caelesti; 'Sarai ut soror' est 
verum intellectuale; 'Aegyptus' est scientia.  Progressus describitur a scientificis usque ad vera caelestia; qui fuit secundum ordinem Divinum, ut Humana Domini Essentia conjungeretur Divinae et fieret 
simul Jehovah. </p>
