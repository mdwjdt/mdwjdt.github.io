<h3 align="center" class="ired">属天的奥秘 第2456节</h3>
<h4 align="center"></h4><p><strong>2456.</strong>创世记19:27-29. 亚伯拉罕清早起来，到了他从前站在耶和华面前的地方。向所多玛和蛾摩拉那一面，并平原的全地面观看。他观看，看哪，那地方烟气上腾，好像烧窑的烟气。当神毁灭平原诸城的时候，神记念亚伯拉罕，正在倾覆罗得所住那城的时候，就打发罗得从倾覆当中出来。<br />“亚伯拉罕清早起来”表主关于末期的思维。亚伯拉罕在此和前面一样，表处于这种状态的主。“到了他从前站在耶和华面前的地方”表祂以前所在的直觉和思维的状态，“地方”表状态。“向所多玛和蛾摩拉那一面观看”表就恶与假而言，关于这些人的内在状态的思维。“平原的全地面”表由此而产生的一切内在状态。“他观看，看哪，那地方烟气上腾，好像烧窑的烟气”表在教会（就是“地”）中，由邪恶状态（就是“烧窑”）所产生的虚假状态（就是“烟气”）。“当神毁灭平原诸城的时候”表当他们通过源于邪恶的虚假，也就是“平原诸城”而灭亡的时候。“神记念亚伯拉罕”表通过主的神性本质与其人性本质的合一实现的救恩。“就打发罗得从倾覆当中出来”表那些处于良善的人和那些处于具有良善的真理之人的救赎，他们在此都由“罗得”来代表。“正在倾覆那城的时候”表当那些处于源自邪恶的虚假之人灭亡的时候。“罗得所住”表即便那些处于这类虚假的人也得救了。</p>

Verses 27-29. And Abraham rose up early in the morning unto the place where he had stood before Jehovah. And he looked against the faces of Sodom and Gomorrah, and against all the faces of the land of 
the plain; and he saw and behold the smoke of the land went up, as the smoke of a furnace. And it came to pass when God destroyed the cities of the plain, that God remembered Abraham, and sent Lot out 
of the midst of the overthrow, when He overthrew the cities in which Lot dwelt. "Abraham rose up early in the morning," signifies the Lord's thought concerning the last time; Abraham here as before 
denotes the Lord in that state; "unto the place where he had stood before Jehovah," signifies the state of perception and thought in which He had been before; "place" denotes state. "And he looked against 
the faces of Sodom and Gomorrah," signifies thought concerning their interior state in respect to evil and falsity; "and against all the faces of the land of the plain," signifies all the interior 
states thence derived; "and he saw and behold the smoke of the land went up, as the smoke of a furnace," signifies a state of falsity (which is "smoke") from a state of evil (which is the "furnace") 
within the church (which is the "land"). "And it came to pass when God destroyed the cities of the plain," signifies when they perished through the falsities of evil, which are the "cities of the plain;" 
"that God remembered Abraham," signifies salvation through the unition of the Lord's Divine Essence with His Human Essence; "and sent Lot out of the midst of the overthrow," signifies the salvation 
of those who are in good, and of those who are in truth in which is good, all of whom are here meant by "Lot;" "when He over- threw the cities," signifies when those who were in falsities from evils 
perished; "in which Lot dwelt," signifies although they who were saved were also in such falsities. </p>

Verse 27-29 And Abraham rose up in the early morning, [and went] to the place where he had stood before Jehovah. And he looked out towards the face of Sodom and Gomorrah, and towards the whole face of 
the land of the plain; and he saw, and behold the smoke of the land went up like the smoke of a furnace. And so it was, when God was destroying the cities of the plain, that God remembered Abraham, 
and Bent Lot away out of the midst of the overthrowing when He was overthrowing the cities in which Lot dwelt. </p>
<p>'Abraham rose up in the early morning' means the Lord's thought concerning the final period, 
'Abraham' here, as previously, meaning the Lord during that state. '[And went] to the place where he had stood before Jehovah' means a state of perception and of thought which He had already experienced 
before, 'place' meaning state. 'And he looked out towards the face of Sodom and Gomorrah' means thought concerning the interior state of these people as to evil and falsity. 'And towards the 
whole face of the land of the plain' means all the interior states resulting from this. 'And he saw, and behold the smoke of the land went up like the smoke of a furnace' means a state of falsity, meant 
by 'the smoke', arising out of a state of evil, meant by 'the furnace', inside the Church, meant by 'the land'. 'And so it was, when God was destroying the cities of the plain' means when they perished 
through falsities deriving from evil, which are meant by 'the cities of the plain'. 'That God remembered Abraham' means salvation achieved through the Lord's Divine Essence united to His Human 'Essence. 
'And sent Lot away out of the midst of the overthrowing' means the salvation of those governed by good and of those governed by truth that has good within it, all of whom here are meant by 'Lot'. 
'When He was overthrowing the cities' means when those perished who were governed by falsities deriving from evils. 'In which Lot dwelt' means that even those also who were saved were governed by 
such falsities. </p>

Vers. 27-29.  Et surrexit Abraham in matuta, ad locum quo steterat ibi coram Jehovah. Et prospexit contra facies Sodomae Amorae, et contra omnes facies terrae planitiei; et vidit, et ecce ascendit fumus 
terrae, sicut fumus fornacis. Et fuit in perdendo Deus urbes planitiei, et recordatus est Deus Abrahami, et emisit Lotum e medio eversionis in evertendo urbes, in quibus habitavit Lot. `Surrexit 
Abraham i matuta' significat Domini cogitationem de ultimo tempore; `Abrahamo est hic, ut prius, Dominus in illo statu: `ad locum quo steterat ibi coram Jehovah' significat statum perceptionis et cogitationis 
in quo fuit prius; `locus' est status: `et prospexit contra facies Sodomae et Amorae' significat cogitationem (x)de statu eorum interiore quoad malum et falsum: `et contra omnes facies terrae 
planitiei significat status omnes interiores qui inde: `et vidit, et ecce fumus terrae sicut fumus fornacis' significat statum falsi, qui est `fumus,' ex statu mali qui est `fornax,' intra Ecclesiam 
quae est `terra': `et fuit in perdendo Deus urbes planitiei' significat cum perirent per falsa mali, quae sunt `urbes planitiei': `et recordatus est Deus Abrahami' significat salvationem per unitionem 
Essentiae Divinae Domini cum Humana Ipsius: `et emisit Lotum e medio eversionis' significat salvatione eorum qui in bono, et qui in vero in quo bonum, qui omnes hic sunt `Lot': `in evertendo urbes' significat 
cum perirent illi qui in falsis a malis: `in quibus habitavit Lot' significat tametsi in talibus etiam essent, qui salvati. </p>
