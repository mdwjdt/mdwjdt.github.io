<h4 align="center"></h4><p><strong>1662.</strong>这些王和民族各自表示某种这样的良善或真理。这从这些民族的内义清楚可知，它们适用于此处所论述的主题；因为每个民族，每个地区一般都表示某种具体的良善或真理；这既在正面意义上适用，也在反面意义上适用；然而，一般意义则适用于当下所论述的主题。这些王的名字和这些民族表示表面的良善与真理，这一点可通过大量经文得以证实；不过，由于前面已多次证实这一点，并且此处出现的名字太多，所以要逐一将它们解释出来，太过于冗长。</p><br />

<p><strong>[NCE]1662.</strong> Each of the kings and each of the nations symbolizes a variety of such goodness or truth, as can be seen from their symbolism on an inner level in relation to the subject at hand. Each nation and each land has some definite though general symbolism, in both a positive and a negative sense. This general symbolism, however, adapts to the subject at hand.<br />Apparent goodness and apparent truth are symbolized by the names of the kings and the nations here, and much evidence exists to prove it, but it has been proved often enough before.{*1} Besides, so many names occur here that explaining the symbolism of each one individually would take too long.<br /><br /><strong>Footnotes:</strong><br />{*1} In his exegesis of <a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_1662/bible_king-james-version_genesis_10_1-32" target=_top>Genesis 10</a> and parts of 11, Swedenborg explains the symbolism of many different lands and tribes, including Shinar (搂搂<a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_1662/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_1183" target=_top>1183</a>, <a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_1662/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_1292" target=_top>1292</a>) and Elam (搂<a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_1662/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_1228" target=_top>1228</a>).

That each of the kings, and each of the nations, signifies such good and such truth, is evident from their signification in the internal sense, as applied to the subject here treated of; for every nation, 
and every land, signifies some certain thing in general, and this both in the proper and in the opposite sense; but the general signification applies itself to the subject being treated of. That 
apparent goods and truths are signified by the names of these kings and these nations, can be confirmed by many passages; but as this has been done so many times before, and as so many names occur here, 
it would be too tedious thus to explain them all one by one. </p>

<p align="center"><b>Elliott(1983-1999) 1662</b></p><p><b>1662.</b>
That each of the kings and each of the nations means some such good or some such truth becomes clear from the meaning of those nations in the internal sense as applied to the subject under consideration; 
for every nation and every land means some specific good or truth in general; this applies in the proper sense and in the contrary sense. The general meaning however has reference to the subject 
under consideration. That apparent goods and truths are meant by the names of these kings and these nations may be confirmed from many places; but since such confirmation has been provided so many times 
already, and as so many names occur here, it would take too long to explain them all one by one in that way. </p>

<p align="center"><b>Latin(1748-1756) 1662</b>
</p><b>1662.</b>
Quod singuli reges et singulae gentes significent tale bonum et tale verum, constare potest a significatione illarum in sensu interno, applicate ad rem de qua agitur; unaquaevis enim gens, ei unaquaevis 
terra, significat aliquod certum in communi, et hoc in sensu proprio et opposito; sed communis significatio se applicat ac rem de qua agitur: quod bona et vera apparentia significentur per nomina 
horum regum et harum gentium, multis confirmari potest sed hoc toties prius confirmatum est, et quia hic tot nomina occurrunt prolixum foret omnia ita singillatim exponere. </p>
