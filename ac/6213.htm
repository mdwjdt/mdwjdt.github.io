<h3 align="center" class="ired">属天的奥秘 第6213节</h3>
<h4 align="center"></h4><p><strong>6213.</strong>地狱通过自己的灵人不断注入邪恶与虚假，这些灵人歪曲并灭绝真理与良善；而主则通过天使不断避开、移除、减轻并缓和这些影响。多年来几乎不间断的经历使我如此熟悉这一点，以致我甚至没有任何怀疑的念头。但是，若要天使能避开来自地狱的流注，此人里面必须有能使他们流入其中并与生活的良善相联结的信之真理。这些真理必须作为他们能进入其中运作的层面。不过，人若没有与良善联结的真理，就会被地狱带走；于是，主通过天使利用所谓的外在约束从外在掌管他。这些约束涉及这个人自己的谨慎，他利用这种谨慎使自己外表看上去就像一个爱邻舍爱国家的人；但他只是为了自己的地位、自己的利益和由这些所带来的名声，还因为对法律制裁，包括死亡的畏惧。当内在约束，也就是良知的约束不存在时，这些就是用来掌管一个人的外在约束。但这些外在约束在来世毫无用处，因为它们从人那里被拿走了；一旦它们被拿走，他看上去就是他内在的样子。</p>

<p align="center"><b>Potts(1905-1910) 6213</b></p><p><b>6213.</b>
That hell through its spirits continually injects evil and falsity, and that these spirits pervert and extinguish truths and goods, and that the Lord through the angels continually averts, removes, mitigates, 
and moderates these efforts, has been made so familiar to me by the almost continual experience of many years, that I cannot even think of any doubt. But in order that the angels may be able 
to avert the influxes from hell, there must be in the man truths of faith joined to good of life into which they may flow. These must be the plane into which they may operate. But if a man have no such 
things, he is carried away by hell, and then the Lord through angels rules him as to externals, which are called external bonds, which belong to the man's own prudence, in order that he may appear 
in external form as a lover of his neighbor and his country; but only for the sake of his own honor, of his own advantage, of reputation for the sake of these, of the fear of the penalties of the law, 
and also of death. These are the external bonds by which a man is ruled, when there are no internal bonds which are of conscience. But these external bonds are of no avail in the other life, for they 
are taken away from the man, and when they are taken away he appears such as he had been inwardly. </p>

<p align="center"><b>Elliott(1983-1999) 6213</b></p><p><b>6213.</b>
By means of its own spirits hell is constantly instilling evil and falsity as well as perverting and wiping out truths and forms of good, whereas the Lord by means of angels is constantly warding off, 
taking away, lessening, and moderating those influences. Many years of almost unceasing experience have made this so familiar to me that I cannot even think about doubting it. But if the angels are 
to be able to ward off influences coming from hell, the truths of faith, joined to the good of life, into which they can flow must exist with the person. Those truths must serve as a base laid down for 
angels to operate into. But if the person does not possess truths joined to good he is brought away from hell, and then by means of angels the Lord governs him externally through what are called external 
restraints. These restraints involve the person's own prudence, which he exercises so that he may be seen, so far as outward appearances go, to be one who loves his neighbour and country, even though 
he is motivated by thoughts of his own position, his own gain, reputation on account of these, and by fear of legal penalties, including death. These are the external restraints that are used to 
govern a person when internal ones, which are those of conscience, do not exist. But those external restraints do nothing in the next life, for they are taken away from a person; and once they have been 
taken away, what he has been like internally is seen. </p>

</p><b>6213.</b>
Quod infernum per spiritus suos continue injiciat malum et falsum, et vera ac bona pervertant et exstinguant, et quod Dominus per angelos continue illa avertat, tollat, mitiget, moderetur, per plurium 
annorum experientiam paene continuam, ita familiare mihi factum est ut ne quidem cogitare queam de aliquo dubio.  Sed ut angeli avertere possint influxus ab inferno, erunt vera fidei juncta bono vitae 
apud hominem in quae influant; haec illis erunt planum in quod operentur.  At si homo talia non habet, aufertur ille ab inferno, et tunc Dominus per angelos regit illum quoad externa quae vincula 
externa vocantur, quae sunt prudentiae propriae ut appareat in externa forma sicut proximi et patriae amans, sed ex causa sui honoris, sui lucri, famae propter illa, timoris poenarum legis, tum mortis; 
haec sunt vincula externa per quae homo regitur, cum interna quae sunt conscientiae, nulla sunt.  Sed externa illa vincula nihil faciunt in altera vita, auferuntur enim ei, et cum ablata sunt, apparet 
homo qualis intus fuerat. </p>
