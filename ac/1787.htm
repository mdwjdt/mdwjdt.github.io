<h3 align="center" class="ired">属天的奥秘 第1787节</h3>
<h4 align="center"></h4><p><strong>1787.</strong>“亚伯兰，你不要惧怕！我是你的盾牌”表值得信靠的对恶与假的防护。这从稍后论述的“盾牌”的含义清楚可知。这些话，即耶和华是“盾牌”，“必大大地赏赐你”，是试探后安慰的话。每种试探都伴随着某种绝望（否则，它就不是试探），因此，安慰随之而来。人被试探时会陷入焦虑，这种焦虑会对所关注的目的产生一种绝望的状态。试探的争战不是别的。对得胜有十足把握的人则不会陷入焦虑，因而不会经历任何试探。<br />主因经历了最为恐怖、残酷的试探，故不可避免地被驱入绝望的状态，但祂凭自己的力量驱散并战胜了这些状态。这从祂在客西马尼所经受的试探清楚看出来，对此，路加福音描述如下：<br />耶稣到了那地方，就对门徒说，你们要祷告，免得陷入试探。于是离开他们约有扔一块石头那么远，跪下祷告，说，父啊！你若愿意，就把这杯撤去；然而，不是照我的意愿，而是要成全你的旨意。有一位天使从天上显现，加添他的力量。耶稣极其伤痛，祷告更加恳切，汗珠如大血点滴在地上。（路加福音<a href="http://39-27.cn/路22.40.htm">22:40</a>-<a href="http://39-27.cn/路22.45.htm">45</a>）<br />马太福音：<br />祂就忧愁起来，极其难过，便对门徒说，我的灵魂甚是忧伤，几乎要死。祂就稍往前走，俯伏在地祷告说，我父啊，倘若可行，求你叫这杯离开我；然而，不是照我所愿的，而是照你所愿的。第二次又去祷告说，我父啊，这杯若不能离开我，必要我喝，就愿你的旨意成全。第三次祷告，说的话还是与先前一样。（马太福音<a href="http://39-27.cn/太26.37.htm">26:37</a>-<a href="http://39-27.cn/太26.44.htm">44</a>）<br />马可福音：<br />祂就开始惊恐起来，极其难过，对门徒说，我的灵魂甚是忧伤，几乎要死。祂就稍往前走，俯伏在地，祷告说，倘若可行，便叫那时候过去。祂说，阿爸，父啊！在你凡事都能，求你将这杯撤去；然而，不是照我所愿的，而是照你所愿的。这事发生了第二次和第三次。（马可福音<a href="http://39-27.cn/可14.33.htm">14:33</a>-<a href="http://39-27.cn/可14.41.htm">41</a>）<br />从上述经文可以看出主的试探的性质，即它们是最为恐怖的，祂从至内在感觉极其痛苦，甚至汗珠如血；那时，祂对于目的和结果都处于绝望的状态；并且祂反复得到安慰。“我是耶和华你的盾牌，必大大地赏赐你”这些话同样体现了前一章所论述的试探的争战过后所得到的安慰。</p>

<p><strong>[NCE]1787.</strong> Do not be afraid, Abram; I am a shield to you, symbolizes protection from evil and falsity, and trust in that protection, as can be seen from the symbolism of a shield, discussed just below.<br />These words — that Jehovah is a shield and very much a reward — are words of comfort after trial. All trial carries with it some kind of despair; otherwise it is not a trial. So consolation follows. Anyone who is being tested becomes anxious, and the anxiety causes a state of despair over the outcome. The actual struggle is nothing else.<br />Those who are sure of victory feel no anxiety, so they face no test.<br />[2] Because the Lord endured the most dreadful, fiercest trials of all, he too was inevitably driven to despair, a despair he was to overcome and dispel by his own power. This is quite clear from his crisis in Gethsemane, described this way in Luke:<br />When Jesus was in the place, he said to his disciples, "Pray not to undergo trial." And he withdrew from them about a stone's throw, and dropping to his knees he prayed, saying, "Father, if you want this cup to pass by me ... Still, let your will be done, not mine." An angel appeared to him from heaven, though, comforting him. And when he was in agony, he prayed more intensely. And his sweat became as drops of blood falling on the ground. (<a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_1787/bible_king-james-version_luke_22_40-45" target=_top>Luke 22:40-45</a>)<br />In Matthew:<br />He began to be grieved and distressed. Then he said to his disciples, "My soul is completely grief-stricken, even to death." And going on a little he fell on his face praying, saying, "My Father, if it is possible, let this cup pass by me. Yet not as I wish but as you do." Again a second time he went away and prayed, saying, "My Father, if this cup cannot pass by me unless I drink it, let your will be done." And he prayed a third time, saying the same words. (<a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_1787/bible_king-james-version_matthew_26_36-44" target=_top>Matthew 26:36-44</a>)<br />In Mark:<br />He began to be terrified and greatly distressed. He said to his disciples, "My soul is wrapped in grief, even to death." Going on a little, he fell on the ground and prayed that, if it was possible, the hour pass by him. He said, "Abba,{*1} Father, all things are possible for you. Make this cup pass by me. Not as I wish, though, but as you do." He did this a second time and a third time. (<a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_1787/bible_king-james-version_mark_14_33-41" target=_top>Mark 14:33-41</a>)<br />[3] These passages show what the Lord's crises were like: they were the fiercest of all; he had very deep-seated anguish, to the point of sweating blood; he was then in a state of despair about the goal and the outcome; and he received comfort. The present words — "I Jehovah am your shield and very much your reward" — also entail comfort after the spiritual battles described in the last chapter.<br /><br /><strong>Footnotes:</strong><br />{*1} Abba is Aramaic for "father." Although Aramaic is the language that Jesus is presumed to have spoken, the Gospels were written in Greek, and the Greek texts have transliterated this word — probably because it had come to seem a sacred proper name. The texts add the Greek word for "father," pater, in explanation, so that the Greek reads ᾽Αββὰ ὁ πατήρ (Abbà ho patér; "Abba the Father"). Swedenborg follows suit, as do most English translations of the New Testament. The term also occurs at <a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_1787/bible_king-james-version_romans_8_15" target=_top>Romans 8:15</a>; <a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_1787/bible_king-james-version_galatians_4_6" target=_top>Galatians 4:6</a>. See The Oxford Dictionary of the Christian Church 2005, under Abba. [RS, LHC] </p>
<p align="center"><b>Potts(1905-1910) 1787</b></p><p><b>1787.</b>
Fear not, Abram, I am a shield to thee. That this signifies protection against evils and falsities, which is to be trusted, is evident from the signification of "a shield," to be explained presently. 
These words, namely, that Jehovah is a shield, and that He is an exceeding great reward, are words of consolation after temptations. Every temptation is attended with some kind of despair (otherwise 
it is not a temptation), and therefore consolation follows. He who is tempted is brought into anxieties, which induce a state of despair as to what the end is to be. The very combat of temptation is nothing 
else. He who is sure of victory is not in anxiety, and therefore is not in temptation.  [2] The Lord also, as He endured the most dire and cruel temptations of all, could not but be driven into 
states of despair, and these He dispelled and overcame by His own power; as may be clearly seen from His temptation in Gethsemane, thus recorded in Luke: </p>
<p>     When Jesus was at the place, He said unto 
the disciples, Pray that ye enter not into temptation. But He was parted from them about a stone's cast; and kneeling down He prayed, saying, Father, if Thou be willing let this cup pass from Me; 
nevertheless, not My will, but Thine, be done. And there appeared unto Him an angel from heaven, strengthening Him; and being in an agony, He prayed more earnestly; and His sweat became as drops of blood 
falling down upon the ground (Luke 22:40-45). In Matthew: </p>
<p>     He began to be sorrowful and sore troubled. Then saith He unto the disciples, My whole soul is sorrowful even unto death. And going 
forward a little, He fell on His face, praying, and saying, My Father, if it be possible, let this cup pass from me; nevertheless, not as I will, but as Thou wilt. Again a second time He went away, and 
prayed, saying, My Father, if this cup cannot pass except I drink it, Thy will be done. And He prayed a third time, saying the same word (Matt. 26:37-44). In Mark: </p>
<p>     He began to be terrified, 
and sore troubled, and said to the disciples, My soul is encompassed with sorrow even unto death. He went forward a little, and fell on the ground, and prayed that, if it were possible, the hour might 
pass away from Him. He said, Abba, Father, all things are possible unto Thee; remove this cup from Me; howbeit, not as I will, but as Thou wilt: and He spake thus a second time and a third (Mark 14:33-41). [3] 
From these passages we may see what was the nature of the Lord's temptations-that they were the most terrible of all; and that He felt anguish from the very inmosts, even to the sweating of 
blood; and that He was then in a state of despair concerning the end and the event; and also that He had consolations. The words now under consideration, "I, Jehovah, am thy shield, and thy exceeding 
great reward," involve in like manner consolation after the combats of temptations treated of in the foregoing chapter. </p>

<p align="center"><b>Elliott(1983-1999) 1787</b></p><p><b>1787.</b>
'Fear not, Abram, I am a shield to you' means protection against evils and falsities which is able to be trusted. This is clear from the meaning of 'a shield', to be dealt with shortly. These words which 
declare that Jehovah is 'a shield' and 'an exceedingly great reward' are words of comfort following temptations. Every temptation entails some kind of despair, or else it is not temptation; and for 
that reason comfort follows. A person who is being tempted is subjected to anxious fears which produce a state of despair over the end in view. The conflict brought about by temptation does not consist 
in anything else. One who is quite certain of victory does not experience any anxiety, nor thus any temptation. </p>
<p></p>
<p><b>[2]</b>
 Since the Lord underwent the most dreadful and the cruelest temptations of all 
it was inevitable that He too should be driven into feelings of despair which He put to flight and overcame by His own power, as becomes quite clear from His temptation in Gethsemane, which is described 
in Luke as follows, </p>
<blockquote>
When Jesus was at the place He said to the disciples, Pray that you may not enter into temptation. But He was withdrawn from them about a stone's throw, and kneeling down 
He prayed, saying, Father, if You are willing, let this cup pass from Me; nevertheless not My will but Yours be done. And there appeared to Him an angel from heaven, strengthening Him. And when He was 
in agony He prayed more earnestly; and His sweat became as great drops of blood falling down upon the ground. <a href="http://bible.gospelcom.net/cgi-bin/bible?passage=Luke%2022:40-45&amp;version=ESV&amp;interface=print&amp;showfn=yes&amp;showxref">Luke 22:40-45</a>. 
</blockquote>
<p>In Matthew, </p>
<blockquote>
He began to be sorrowful and in agony. Then He said to the 
disciples, My soul is utterly dejected even to death. And He went forward a little and praying fell on His face, saying, My Father, if it is possible, let this cup pass from Me; nevertheless, not as 
I will but as You will. Again, for the second time, He went away and prayed, saying, My Father, if this cup cannot pass from Me unless I drink it, Your will be done. And He prayed for the third time, 
saying the same thing.<A name="fntext1"></a><A href="#fn1"><sup>a</sup></a> <a href="http://bible.gospelcom.net/cgi-bin/bible?passage=Matt%2026:36-44&amp;version=ESV&amp;interface=print&amp;showfn=yes&amp;showxref">Matt 26:36-44</a>. 
</blockquote>
<p>In Mark, </p>
<blockquote>
He began to be terrified and in great agony. He said to the disciples, My soul is wrapped in dejection, even to death. He went forward a little, 
fell on the ground, and prayed that if it were possible the hour might pass from Him. He said, Abba, Father, all things are possible to You; remove this cup from Me; yet not as I will but as You will. 
This happened a second and a third time. <a href="http://bible.gospelcom.net/cgi-bin/bible?passage=Mark%2014:33-41&amp;version=ESV&amp;interface=print&amp;showfn=yes&amp;showxref">Mark 14:33-41</a>.

<p><b>[3]</b>
 These quotations show the nature of the Lord's temptations - that they were the most frightful of all; that He suffered agony from the 
inmost parts of His being, even to the sweating of blood; that He was at the time in a state of despair over the end in view and over the outcome; and that He received comfort repeatedly. The words 'I 
am Jehovah your shield, your exceedingly great reward' in a similar way embody the comfort received after the conflicts brought about by the temptations which were described in the previous chapter.
