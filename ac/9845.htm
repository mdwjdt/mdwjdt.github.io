<h3 align="center" class="ired">属天的奥秘 第9845节</h3>
<h4 align="center"></h4><p><strong>9845.</strong>“都照他们的世代”表这两种都在它们一个从另一个生出并发出的秩序中。这从“世代”的含义清楚可知。“世代”是指是指信与仁的事物，或灵界中的真理和良善的形式（参看<a href="613.htm">613</a>，<a href="2020.htm">2020</a>，<a href="2584.htm">2584</a>，<a href="6239.htm">6239</a>，<a href="9042.htm">9042</a>，<a href="9079.htm">9079</a>节）；因此，“照世代”表示照它们一个从另一个生出并发出的秩序；也就是说，来自真理的良善和来自良善的真理。因为从主新生的人都会经历两种状态，第一种是真理的状态，第二种是良善的状态。只要处于第一种状态，此人就通过真理被引向良善；但在第二种状态下，他通过良善被引导。这第二种状态是与人同在的天堂状态，因为人在处于良善之前，不在天堂（参看刚才所示<a href="9832.htm">9832</a>节）。由此明显可知“都照以色列人的世代”表示什么。之所以说“它们一个从另一个生出并发出的秩序”，是因为正如良善通过真理生出，后来它也从它们发出；同样，正如真理从良善生出，后来它们也如此发出。因为它们按连续阶段生出，后来按它们生出的连续阶段的次序发出。不过，这些事是说给那些知道一系列事物如何按连续阶段产生之人的。</p>

According to their generations. That this signifies each in that order in which the one is generated and proceeds from the other, is evident from the signification of "generations" as being the things 
which are of faith and charity; that is, those which belong to truth and good in the spiritual world (see n. 613, 2020, 2584, 6239, 9042, 9079); whence "according to the generations," denotes according 
to the order in which the one is generated and proceeds from the other; namely, good from truth, and truth from good. For the man who is being generated anew by the Lord has two states; the first 
is a state of truth, and the second is a state of good. So long as the man is in the first state, he is led by means of truths to good; but when he is in the second state, he is led by means of good. 
This latter state is the state of heaven with the man, for he is not in heaven until he is in good (see what was shown above, n. 9832). From all this it is evident what is signified by "according to the 
generations of the sons of Israel." It is said "in that order in which the one is generated and proceeds from the other," because just as good is generated by means of truths, so afterward it proceeds; 
and in like manner just as truths are generated from good, so afterward they proceed. For they are generated successively, and proceed afterward in that order in which they have successively been 
born. But these things are said for those who know how series of things are produced successively. </p>

'According to their generations' means both kinds in the order in which they are begotten and proceed one from the other. This is clear from the meaning of 'generations' as matters of faith and charity, 
or forms of truth and goodness in the spiritual world, dealt with in <a href="613.htm">613</a>, <a href="2020.htm">2020</a>, <a href="2584.htm">2584</a>, <a href="6239.htm">6239</a>, <a href="9042.htm">9042</a>, <a href="9079.htm">9079</a>, so that 'according to generations' means according to the order in which they are begotten and 
proceed one from the other, that is to say, good from truth and truth from good. For there are two states which the person undergoing new birth from the Lord passes through, the first being a state 
of truth, the other a state of good. While in the first state the person is led by means of truths towards good, but in the second he is led by means of good. This second state is the state of heaven 
with a person; for a person is not in heaven until good is present within him, see what has been shown above in <a href="9832.htm">9832</a>. From all this it is evident what 'according to the generations of the sons of Israel' 
means. The words 'in the order in which they are begotten and proceed one from the other' are used because even as good is begotten by means of truths, so does it afterwards proceed from them; and 
in a similar way even as truths are begotten from good, so do they afterwards proceed. For they are begotten in consecutive stages and proceed subsequently in the order of their consecutive stages of 
birth. But these matters have been stated for the benefit of those who know about the way in which series of things are produced in consecutive stages.  </p>

`Secundum generationes illorum': quod significet utrumque eo ordine quo gignitur et procedit unum ab altero, constat ex significatione `generationum' quod sint quae fidei et charitatis, seu quae veri 
et boni in spirituali mundo, de qua n. 613, 2020, 2584, 6239, 9042, 9079; ita secundum generationes est secundum ordinem quo gignitur et procedit unum ab altero, nempe {1}bonum a vero et verum a bono. 
Sunt enim bini status homini qui generatur e novo a Domino, primus status est veri et alter boni; cum homo in primo statu est, ducitur ille per vera ad bonum, cum autem in altero statu est, (x)ducitur 
ille per bonum; hic status est status caeli apud hominem, nam non prius in caelo est quam cum in bono, videantur quae de his supra n. 9832 ostensa sunt; ex his patet quid significat secundum generationes 
filiorum Israelis. Dicitur eo ordine quo gignitur et procedit unum ab altero, nam sicut bonum per vera gignitur, ita postea procedit; similiter sicut vera (c)a bono gignuntur, ita postea procedunt; 
gignuntur enim successive, et procedunt dein eo ordine quo successive nata sunt; sed haec illis dicta sint qui sciunt quomodo series rerum producuntur {2}successive. @1 vera a bono, et bonum per
