<h3 align="center" class="ired">属天的奥秘 第6884节</h3>
<h4 align="center"></h4><p><strong>6884.</strong>“耶和华你们祖宗的神”表古教会的神。这从前面所述（<a href="6876.htm">6876</a>节）清楚可知，那里有同样的话。就外在历史意义而言，“你们祖宗的神”是指亚伯拉罕、以撒、雅各的神；但就内义而言，是指古教会的神。内义上所指的是后者，而非前者；这一点可从以下事实看出来，圣言的历史无法进入天堂；因为圣言的历史是属世和世俗的，天上的人只拥有属灵的观念，所以他们以属灵的方式理解圣言，理解作为历史所写的东西。构成圣言字义的世俗描述在仅抵达天堂的门槛或边缘时，就转化为灵义。事实的确如此，这一点从以下考虑可在某种程度上看出来：世人也经常将他正在被告知的东西转化为占据他整个思维的那类事物；也就是说，思维不洁净的人将它们转化为不洁之物；观念洁净的人则将它们转化为洁净之物。正因如此，天上的人并不将“你们祖宗的神”理解为亚伯拉罕、以撒和雅各的神，因为在天上，他们并不知道亚伯拉罕、以撒和雅各，只知道他们所代表的主。因此，这些话所指的，是古教会的神。</p>

Jehovah, the God of your fathers. That this signifies the Divine of the Ancient Church, is evident from what was said above (n. 6876), where are like words. In the external historic sense, by "the God 
of their fathers" is meant the God of Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob; but in the internal sense is meant the Divine of the Ancient Church. That the latter, and not the former, is meant in the internal sense, 
can be seen from the fact that the historicals of the Word cannot enter into heaven; for the historical of the Word is natural and worldly, and those who are in heaven are in no ideas but what are 
spiritual, so that they understand the Word spiritually; and what is worldly, which is of the sense of the letter of the Word, is at the very threshold of heaven turned into the spiritual sense. That 
this is so, can in some measure be seen from the fact that man also frequently turns those things which are said into such as engage his whole thought; thus he who is in unclean things, into what is 
unclean; and he who is in clean things, into what is clean. Hence then it is that they who are in heaven, by "the God of your fathers" do not perceive the God of Abraham, of Isaac, and of Jacob (for 
Abraham,  Isaac, and Jacob are not known in heaven), but the Lord who is represented by them; and therefore it is the Divine of the Ancient Church which is signified by these words.  </p>

'The God of your fathers' means Him who was the God of the Ancient Church. This is clear from what has been stated above in <a href="6876.htm">6876</a>, where similar words occur. In the external sense written as history the 
words 'the God of their fathers' are used to mean the God of Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob, but in the internal sense to mean Him who was the God of the Ancient Church. That the latter, not the former, 
is what is meant in the internal sense may be recognized from the consideration that the historical record contained in the Word cannot find its way into heaven. For the historical record in the Word 
is concerned with what is natural and worldly, but those in heaven possess exclusively spiritual ideas and thus they understand in a spiritual Way that which is written as history. And when the description 
of what is worldly, constituting the sense of the letter of the Word, reaches only the outskirts of heaven it is converted into the spiritual sense. Some recognition that this is so may also be 
gained from the consideration that man too on many occasions converts what he is being told into the kinds of things that occupy his entire thinking; that is, one whose thoughts are unclean turns them 
into what is unclean, and one whose ideas are clean into what is clean. So it is then that by 'the God of your fathers' those in heaven do not perceive the God of Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob, for in heaven 
they have no thought of Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob, only of the Lord who is represented by them. It is for this reason that He who was the God of the Ancient Church is what those words mean. </p>

`Deus patrum vestrorum': quod significet Divinum Antiquae Ecclesiae, constat ex illis quae supra n. 6876 dicta sunt, ubi similia.  In sensu externo historico per `Deum patrum eorum' intelliguntur Abraham, 
Jischak, et Jacob, sed in sensu interno Divinum (t)Ecclesiae Antiquae; quod hoc non illud intelligatur in sensu interno, constare potest ex eo quod historicum Verbi non intrare possit in caelum; 
historicum enim Verbi est naturale et mundanum, et qui in caelo sunt non nisi quam in ideis spiritualibus sunt, ita spiritualiter intelligunt illud, ac mundanum, quod est sensus litterae Verbi, ad primum 
limen caeli, vertitur in sensum spiritualem; quod ita sit, quodammodo etiam constare potest ex eo quod homo saepenumero vertat illa quae dicuntur, etiam in talia in quibus ille est tota cogitatione; 
ita qui in immundis est in immunda, et qui in mundis in munda; inde nunc est quod qui in caelo per `Deum patrum vestrorum' non percipiant Deum Abrahami, Jischaki, et Jacobi, nam non {1}cognoscuntur 
in caelo Abraham, Jischak, et Jacob, sed Dominus, Qui repraesentatur per illos; quapropter est Divinum Ecclesiae Antiquae quod per illa verba significatur. 	@1 cognoscitur$ </p>
