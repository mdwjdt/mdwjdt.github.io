<h3 align="center" class="ired">属天的奥秘 第10114节</h3>
<h4 align="center"></h4><p><strong>10114</strong>.“那充满（手）的肉或饼，若有一点留到早晨”表没有与新状态结合的属灵和属天良善。这从“留下的一点肉和饼”、“肉”、“充满”、“饼”、“早晨”的含义清楚可知：“留下的一点肉和饼”是指没有变成他们自己的事物，因为“吃”表示变成人自己的（参看<a href="10109.htm">10109</a>节），因此没有被吃掉的东西表示没有变成他们自己的东西；“肉”是指良善（<a href="7850.htm">7850</a>，<a href="9127.htm">9127</a>节）；“充满（手）”是指接受（<a href="10076.htm">10076</a>，<a href="10110.htm">10110</a>节），因此，“充满（手）的肉”表示在良善里面对真理的良善，因而这真理与良善的结合，但在此表示缺乏任何这种接受或结合，因为所指的是留下来的肉；“饼”是指属天良善，也就是至内在的良善（<a href="10077.htm">10077</a>节）；“早晨”是指一种新的状态（<a href="8211.htm">8211</a>，<a href="8427.htm">8427</a>节）。由此明显可知，“那充满（手）的肉或饼，若有一点留到早晨”表示没有与新状态结合的属灵和属天良善。因为祭肉表示属灵良善，也就是对邻之仁的良善；而祭饼表示属天良善，也就是对主之爱的良善。<br />必须简要说明如何进一步理解没有与新状态结合是什么意思。一个新状态是指当一个正在重生的人出于良善，因而出于情感和爱，而不是像以前那样出于真理，或出于纯粹的顺从而行动时所存在的每一个状态。当天堂里的人处于爱之良善时，一个新状态也会出现，这种状态在那里被称为“早晨”；因为爱与信的状态在那里会发生变化，像地上的正午、晚上、（黎明前的）破晓和早晨一样。另外，当一个旧教会结束，一个新教会开始时，一个新状态就会出现。在圣言中，所有这些新状态都由“早晨”来表示，解释创世记和出埃及记的各个地方对其中的每一种状态都有具体的描述。类似的事由这一条例来表示：逾越节的肉不可剩下一点留到早晨，剩下的要用火烧了（出埃及记<a href="http://39-27.cn/出12.10.htm">12:10</a>）；也由这一命令来表示：节上的脂肪不可留过夜到早晨（出埃及记<a href="http://39-27.cn/出23.18.htm">23:18</a>）。<br />类似的事也由这一条例来表示：感恩祭的肉，所剩下的第二天也可以吃，到第三天要焚烧（利未记<a href="http://39-27.cn/利7.16.htm">7:16</a>-<a href="http://39-27.cn/利7.18.htm">18</a>；<a href="http://39-27.cn/利19.6.htm">19:6</a>，<a href="http://39-27.cn/利19.7.htm">7</a>）；“第三天”也表示一个新状态（<a href="4901.htm">4901</a>，<a href="5123.htm">5123</a>，<a href="5159.htm">5159</a>节）。之所以赐下这样的条例，是因为感恩祭是还愿祭和甘心祭。人们献上它们不像献上其它祭祀一样是那么为了洁净和分别为圣；而是为了让他们可以在圣地或圣所同吃，并为神性敬拜所给予他们的内心喜乐而作见证。他们称之为圣的这些节筵给这些人带来更大的欢乐，胜过其它一切敬拜。类似的事还由这一命令来表示：他们不可将吗哪留一点到早晨；对此，经上在摩西五经如此记着说：<br />摩西说，所收的吗哪，不许什么人留到早晨。他们不听从摩西，有人把它留到早晨，它就生虫变臭了。（出埃及记<a href="http://39-27.cn/出16.19.htm">16:19</a>，<a href="http://39-27.cn/出16.20.htm">20</a>）</p>

And if there be anything left of the flesh of fillings and of the bread unto the morning. That this signifies spiritual and celestial goods which have not been conjoined for a new state, is evident from 
the signification of what was "left of the flesh and of the bread," as being that which had not been appropriated; for by "eating" is signified to be appropriated (see n. 10109), thus by that which 
was not eaten is signified what was not appropriated; from the signification of "flesh," as being good (n. 7850, 9127); from the signification of "fillings," as being receptivity (n. 10076, 10110, hence 
by "the flesh of fillings" is signified the reception of truth in good, consequently their conjunction, but in this case non-reception and non-conjunction, because what was left of the flesh is meant); 
from the signification of "bread," as being celestial good, which is inmost good (n. 10077); and from the signification of "morning," as being a new state (n. 8211, 8427). From all this it is evident 
that by "what was left of the flesh of fillings and of the bread until the morning," are signified spiritual and celestial goods which were not conjoined for a new state. For by "the flesh of the 
sacrifice" is signified spiritual good, which is the good of charity toward the neighbor; and by the "bread of the sacrifice" is signified celestial good, which is the good of love to the Lord.  [2] 
What is further meant by not being conjoined for a new state, must be told in a few words. A new state is every state of the conjunction of good and truth which exists when the man who is being regenerated 
acts from good, thus from the affection which is of love, and not as before from truth, or from mere obedience. There is also a new state when they who are in heaven are in the good of love, 
which state is there called morning, for the states of love and of faith vary there, like noon, evening, twilight, and morning on earth. And there is also a new state when an old church is ceasing, and 
a new one is beginning. All these new states in the Word are signified by "morning," and each of them has been described in the explications of Genesis and Exodus throughout. The like things are signified 
by the law that nothing should be left of the flesh of the passover until the morning, and that the residue of it should be burned with fire (Exod. 12:10); also by the law that the fat of the feast 
should not be kept all night until the morning (Exod. 23:18). [3] Like things are also signified by the law that the residue of the flesh of the eucharistic sacrifice should be eaten also on the 
following day, but should be burned on the third day (Lev. 7:16-18; 19:6, 7); by the "third day" is also signified a new state (n. 4901, 5123, 5159). This was so granted because the eucharistic sacrifices 
were votive and voluntary sacrifices, not so much for the sake of purification and sanctification as the rest; but that they might eat together in the holy place, and testify joy of heart from Divine 
worship; and these banquets, which they called holy, gave them more gladness than all other worship. Similar things are also signified by the law respecting the manna, that they should not leave 
anything of it until the morning, of which it is thus written in Moses: </p>
<p>     Moses said, Let no man leave of the manna till the morning. But they did not obey Moses; for they made a residue of it until 
the morning, and it bred worms and became putrid (Exod. 16:19, 20). </p>

'And if anything of the flesh of fillings [of the hand], and of the bread, is left until the morning' means spiritual and celestial forms of good which have not been linked to the new state. This is 
clear from the meaning of 'anything of the flesh and of the bread that is left' as that which has not been made their own, for 'eating' means making one's own, <a href="10109.htm">10109</a>, so that what has not been eaten means 
what has not been made their own; from the meaning of 'the flesh' as good, dealt with in <a href="7850.htm">7850</a>, <a href="9127.htm">9127</a>; from the meaning of 'fillings [of the hand]' as reception, dealt with in <a href="10076.htm">10076</a>, <a href="10110.htm">10110</a>, so that 
'the flesh of fillings [of the hand]' means the reception of truth in good, and therefore the joining together of this truth and good, though in this instance the lack of any such reception or joining 
together is meant because what is left of the flesh must be understood; from the meaning of 'the bread' as celestial good, which is inmost good, dealt with in <a href="10077.htm">10077</a>; and from the meaning of 'the morning' 
as a new state, dealt with in <a href="8211.htm">8211</a>, <a href="8427.htm">8427</a>. From these meanings it is evident that 'anything of the flesh of fillings [of the hand], and of the bread, left until the morning' means spiritual and celestial 
forms of good which have not been linked to the new state. For the flesh of the sacrifice means spiritual good, which is the good of charity towards the neighbour, and the bread of it celestial 
good, which is the good of love to the Lord.  </p>
<p></p>
<p><b>[2]</b>
 What more should be understood by not being linked to the new state must be stated briefly. A new state is every state in which good and truth are 
joined together, and this occurs when the actions of a person who is being regenerated spring from good, thus from affection and love, and not as previously from truth or mere obedience. A new state 
also occurs when the good of love arises among those in heaven, a state called 'the morning' there; for different states of love and faith come round there, like midday, evening, [pre-dawn] twilight, 
and morning on earth. In addition a new state occurs when an old Church comes to an end and a new one begins. All these new states are meant in the Word by 'the morning'; each has been dealt with specifically 
in various places in the explanations of Genesis and Exodus.  </p>
<p>Similar things are meant by the rule that 'none of the flesh of the Passover lamb shall be left until the morning' and that 
what did remain of it was to be burned with fire, <a href="http://bible.gospelcom.net/cgi-bin/bible?passage=Exod%2012:10&amp;version=ESV&amp;interface=print&amp;showfn=yes&amp;showxref">Exod 12:10</a>, and also by the command that 'the fat of the feast shall not remain through the night until morning', <a href="http://bible.gospelcom.net/cgi-bin/bible?passage=Exod%2023:18&amp;version=ESV&amp;interface=print&amp;showfn=yes&amp;showxref">Exod 23:18</a>. </p>
<p><b>[3]</b>
 Similar things were 
also meant by the rule that what remained from the flesh of a eucharistic sacrifice could be eaten on the following day as well, but had to be burned on the third day, <a href="http://bible.gospelcom.net/cgi-bin/bible?passage=Lev%207:16-18;%2019:6,7&amp;version=ESV&amp;interface=print&amp;showfn=yes&amp;showxref">Lev 7:16-18; 19:6,7</a>, 'the third 
day' too meaning a new state, see <a href="4901.htm">4901</a>, <a href="5123.htm">5123</a>, <a href="5159.htm">5159</a>. The reason for the concession contained in this rule was that eucharistic sacrifices were offerings made in connection with vows or they were voluntary 
offerings. They were presented by people not so much, as all other sacrifices were, for the sake of being purified and sanctified, as in order that they might eat in a holy place and bear witness 
to the joy in their heart that Divine worship gave them. And these feasts, which they called holy, brought greater gladness to those people than all other worship. Similar things were also meant by 
the command that they should not leave any of the manna until the morning, spoken of in Moses as follows,  </p>
<blockquote>
Moses said, Let no man leave any of the manna until the morning. But they did not obey Moses, 
for they did leave some of it<A name="fntext1"></a><A href="#fn1"><sup>a</sup></a> until the morning; and it produced worms and became putrid. <a href="http://bible.gospelcom.net/cgi-bin/bible?passage=Exod%2016:19,20&amp;version=ESV&amp;interface=print&amp;showfn=yes&amp;showxref">Exod 16:19,20</a>.

`Et si relictum fuerit de carne impletionum et de pane usque ad mane': quod significet bona spiritualia et caelestia quae non conjuncta sunt ad statum novum, constat ex significatione `relicti ex carne 
et ex pane' quod sit quod non appropriatum est, nam per `comedere' significatur appropriari, n. 10,109, ita per id quod non comestum est, significatur quod non appropriatum est; ex significatione 
`carnis' quod sit bonum, de qua n. 7850, 9127; ex significatione `impletionum' quod sint receptivum, de qua n. 10,076, 10,110; inde per `carnem impletionum' significatur receptio veri in bono, proinde 
(o)eorum conjunctio; hic (o)autem non receptio et non conjunctio, quia intelligitur relictum ejus; ex significatione `panis' quod sit bonum caeleste, quod est bonum intimum, de qua n. 10,077; et ex significatione 
`mane' quod sit status novus, de qua n. 8211, 8427; ex quibus patet quod per `relictum de carne impletionum et de pane usque ad mane' significentur bona spiritualia et caelestia, quae non 
conjuncta sunt ad statum novum, per `carnem' enim sacrificii significatur bonum spirituale, quod est bonum charitatis erga proximum, et per `panem' (o)ibi bonum caeleste, quod est bonum amoris in Dominum. 	[2] 
Quid porro intelligitur per non conjunctionem ad statum novum, paucis dicetur: status novus est omnis status conjunctionis boni et veri, qui est quando homo qui regeneratur ex bono agit, 
ita ex affectione quae amoris, et non ut prius ex vero, seu ex sola oboedientia; status novus etiam est quando illi qui in caelo in bono amoris sunt, qui status ibi vocatur `mane,' nam variantur status 
amoris et fidei ibi sicut in terris meridies, vespera, diluculum, et mane; et quoque status novus est cum vetus Ecclesia desinit, et nova incohat; omnes hi novi status in Verbo significantur per `mane' 
{1}; de singulis illis (o)passim actum est in explicationibus ad Genesin et ad Exodum. 	[3] Similia significantur per quod non relinquetur de carne pecudis Paschalis usque ad mane, et residuum de 
illo igne combureretur, Exod. xii 10; tum per quod non pernoctabit adeps festi usque ad mane, Exod. xxiii 18; similia etiam significantur per quod residuum de {2} carne sacrificii eucharistici comederetur 
etiam die sequente, sed combureretur die tertio, Lev. vii 16-18, xix 6, 7; per `diem tertium' etiam significatur status novus, videatur n. 4901, 5123, 5159; quod ita concessum fuerit, erat causa 
quia sacrificia eucharistica erant sacrificia votiva et voluntaria, non ita propter purificationem et sanctificationem ut reliqua, sed ut comederent in loco sancto, ac testificarentur gaudium cordis 
ex cultu Divino; et {3} (x)comessationes illae, quas vocabant sanctas, prae reliquo cultu {4} illos laetificabant.  Similia etiam significantur per quod non relinquerent aliquid de manna (o)usque ad mane, 
de qua ita apud Moschen,      	Dixit Moscheh, Ne vir relinquat de manna usque ad mane; sed non oboediverunt Moschi, reliquum namque fecerunt de eo usque ad mane, et produxit vermes et computruit, 
Exod. xvi 19, 20. @1 qui apud regenerandos et regeneratos est continuus, est etiam status novus quando homo, qui regeneratur, ex bono agit, et non sicut prius ex vero; status novus etiam quando illi 
qui in coelo in bono amoris sunt; et quoque status novus est, cum verus Ecclesia desinit et nova inchoat; omnes hi status in Verbo vocantur mane, ac intelliguntur per mane$ @2 ex$ @3 et sic testificarentur$ @4
