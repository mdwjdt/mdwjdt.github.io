<h3 align="center" class="ired">属天的奥秘 第409节</h3>
<h4 align="center"></h4><p><strong>409.</strong>被称为“该隐”的异端，其情形也是如此，随着时间推移，它也荒废了，因为尽管它承认爱，但却将信搁在首位，置于爱之前，并且由该隐衍生出的一系列异端逐渐偏离它，到了第六代的拉麦，甚至彻底拒绝信。当这一刻到来时，新光或早晨就发出，被称为“拉麦之妻”、名为“亚大和洗拉”的新教会便被建立。尽管拉麦不再有信，但她们仍被称作拉麦的妻子，就好比犹太人也没有信，其内在与外在的教会在圣言中仍被称作“妻子”，以雅各的两个妻子利亚和拉结来代表，利亚代表外在的教会，拉结代表内在的教会。这些教会看似两个，但实际上只一个。因为纯粹外在或代表性、缺乏内在的教会完全是偶像崇拜，是死的；而内在与外在在一起，才会构成同一个教会，正如这里的亚大与洗拉一样。然而，由于雅各及其后裔像拉麦一样丧失了信，所以教会无法继续与他们同在，而是被转移到既无信又无知的外邦人中。教会极少存留在那些荒废时仍拥有真理的人中，而是被转移到对真理一无所知的人当中，因为这些人比前者更容易接受信。</p>

<p><strong>[NCE]409.</strong> The situation was similar for the heresy named Cain, which over time suffered devastation. It is true that this heresy acknowledged love, but it put faith in first place, ahead of love. The further heresies that it bred gradually deviated from this, and Lamech, the sixth in line, absolutely denied faith. When this era arrived, a new light or dawn emerged and grew into a new church, here called Adah and Zillah, who are described as Lamech's wives.<br />They are called the wives of Lamech (who was devoid of faith) just as the inner church and outer church of the Jews (who were also devoid of faith) are called wives in the Word. This was represented in Leah and Rachel, the two wives of Jacob; Leah stood for the outer church and Rachel for the inner. Although this pair of churches appears to be two churches, they are one church, because the external, representative church without the internal church is simply something idolatrous or dead. The internal together with the external, on the other hand, formed one and the same church, as Adah and Zillah do here.<br />Since "Jacob" or in other words his descendants were, like Lamech, lacking in faith, the church could not remain among them but was transferred to non-Jewish nations, who lived in ignorance rather than faithlessness. Rarely if ever does the church survive among possessors of the truth while they are undergoing devastation. Instead it is transferred to those who know absolutely nothing of the truth, because they embrace faith much more easily. </p>

The case was the same with the heresy called "Cain" which in process of time was vastated, for although it acknowledged love, yet it made faith the chief and set it before love, and the heresies derived 
from this one gradually wandered from it, and Lamech, who was the sixth in order, altogether denied even faith. When this time arrived, a new light, or morning, shone forth, and a new church was made 
which is here named "Adah and Zillah" who are called the "wives of Lamech." They are called the wives of Lamech, although he possessed no faith, just as the internal and external church of the Jews, 
who also had no faith, are also in the Word called "wives" being represented by Leah and Rachel, the two wives of Jacob-Leah representing the external church and Rachel the internal. These churches, 
although they appear like two, are yet only one; for the external or representative, separate from the internal, is but as something idolatrous, or dead, whereas the internal together with the external 
constitute a church, and even one and the same church, as Adah and Zillah do here. As however Jacob and his posterity, like Lamech, had no faith, the church could not remain with them, but was transferred 
to the Gentiles, who lived not in infidelity but in ignorance. The church rarely, if ever, remains with those who when vastated have truths among them [apud se] but is transferred to those who 
know nothing at all of truths, for these embrace the faith much more easily than the former. </p>

<p align="center"><b>Elliott(1983-1999) 409</b></p><p><b>409.</b>
The same applied to the heresy called Cain, which was vastated with the passage of time, for it did, it is true, acknowledge love, yet it made faith the chief thing and set it above love. The heresies 
descending from Cain however gradually strayed even from this, and Lamech, who was the sixth in the line, went so far as to reject faith altogether. At this point new light or the morning began to dawn, 
and a new Church came into being which is here called 'Adah and Zillah', the names of the wives of Lamech. They are called the wives of Lamech, who was devoid of any faith, just as the internal and 
external Church among the Jews, who were also devoid of any faith, are in the Word called wives. The same was also represented by Leah and Rachel, Jacob's two wives, Leah representing the external 
Church and Rachel the internal. These Churches, seemingly two, are nevertheless one, for a Church that is purely external or representative and lacks the internal is something completely idolatrous or 
dead, but the internal Church and the external together constitute one and the same Church, as Adah and Zillah do here. But because, like Lamech, Jacob, that is, the descendants of Jacob, were totally 
devoid of faith, the Church could not continue with them. Instead it was transferred to gentiles whose lives were not contrary to faith but were without knowledge. Rarely, if ever, does a Church remain 
with people who, once vastated, are in possession of truths. Instead it is transferred to those who know absolutely nothing about such truths, for such people embrace faith far more easily than the 
former do.  </p>

</p><b>409.</b>
Similiter se res habuit cum haeresi quae 'Cain' vocata quae temporis tractu vastata est, nam agnovit quidem amorem sed fidem principalem fecit, et praetulit amori; at haereses inde derivatae sensim aberrabant 
ab hoc, et 'Lamech,' qui fuit sextus ordine, prorsus etiam fidem negavit: cum hoc tempus fuit, tunc nova lux seu mane illuxit, et facta est Ecclesia nova, quae hic vocatur 'Adah et Zillah,' 
quae uxores Lamechi vocantur. Uxores Lamechi, qui nullius fidei fuit, dicuntur, sicut Ecclesia interna et externa Judaeorum, qui quoque nullius fidei fuerant, quae Ecclesiae quoque uxores vocantur in 
Verbo; quod etiam repraesentatum fuit per 'Leam et Rachelem,' binas uxores Jacobi, quarum 'Leah' repraesentabat Ecclesiam externam et 'Rachel' internam; quae Ecclesiae, tametsi binae apparent, usque una 
sunt, nam externa seu repraesentativa absque interna nihil est nisi quoddam idololatricum aut mortuum, at interna cum externa Ecclesiam et unam eandemque constituit, sicut hic 'Adah et Zillah': sed 
quia Jacobus seu posteritas Jacobi erat sicut Lamech nullius fidei, Ecclesia non potuit manere ibi, sed translata est ad gentes, qui non in infidelitate sed in ignorantia vixerunt. Raro, si usquam, manet 
Ecclesia apud eos qui veritates habent apud se, dum vastati sunt, sed transfertur ad eos qui prorsus nihil de illis sciunt, nam multo facilius hi amplectuntur fidem quam illi. </p>
