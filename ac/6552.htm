Verse 14. And Joseph returned into Egypt, he and his brethren, and all that went up with him to bury his father, after he had buried his father. "And Joseph returned into Egypt, he and his brethren," 
signifies the life of the internal celestial and of the truths of faith in memory-knowledges; "and all that went up with him to bury his father," signifies all things that conduce to regeneration; "after 
he had buried his father," signifies to resuscitate the church. </p>

Verse 14 And Joseph returned to Egypt, he and his brothers, and all who went up with him to bury his father, after he had buried his father. </p>
<p>'And Joseph returned to Egypt, he and his brothers' means 
the life of the internal celestial, and of the truths of faith present within factual knowledge. 'And all who went up with him to bury his father' means all that contributes to regeneration. 'After 
he had buried his father' means to restore the Church to life. </p>

significat vitam caelestis interni et verorum fidei in scientificis: `et omnes ascendentes cum eo ad sepeliendum patrem ejus' significat omnia quae ad regenerationem conducunt: `postquam sepelire eum 
patrem suum' significat ad resuscitandam Ecclesiam. </p>
