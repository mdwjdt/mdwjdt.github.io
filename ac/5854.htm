<h3 align="center" class="ired">属天的奥秘 第5854节</h3>
<h4 align="center"></h4><p><strong>5854.</strong>主规定，灵人当流入世人的思维和欲望，而天使则流入他所关注的目的，进而通过这些目的流入随目的而来的一切。天使也通过善灵流入他在生活中所做的好行为和所信的真理；他们利用这些引导他尽可能地远离邪恶和虚假。这种流注虽悄无声息，不为世人所察觉，但仍隐密地有效运行。天使尤其转移邪恶的目的，引入良善的目的。不过，他们若无法做到这一点，就会退离；并且越无法做到这一点，就退得越远；他们越不在场，恶灵就越靠近。因为天使不可能存在于邪恶的目的中，也就是存在于自我之爱和尘世之爱中；即便如此，他们仍旧同在，只是相距甚远。<br />主能用全能的力量通过天使将人引入良善的目的；但这会夺走此人的生命，因为人的生命就在于与这些目的完全相反的爱中。因此，这条神性律法是不可违反的，即：人当处于自由；良善与真理，或仁与信当在他自由的时候，而绝不可在强迫之下被植入。因为凡在强迫状态下所接受的东西，都不会存留，而是会消散。事实上，强迫一个人做某事，并不等于将它注入此人的意愿，因为在强迫的状态下，这个人必须按照别人的意志或意愿去行；因此，当他回到自己的意愿，也就是自己的自由中时，凡在强迫状态下所注入的，都会被根除。所以，主通过人的自由掌管他，尽可能地约束他，使他远离思想和意愿邪恶的自由。因为主若不约束人，人就不断陷入最深的地狱。<br />刚才我们说，主能用全能的力量通过天使把人引入良善的目的；因为恶灵能瞬间被赶走，哪怕人周围有成千上万的恶灵；而这种事只需一位天使就能做到。但这个时候，此人会经受如此的折磨，进入如此的地狱，以致他绝无可能承受得住，因为他会悲惨地被剥夺生命。事实上，人的生命就在于反对良善和真理的恶欲和谬念。若这生命不通过恶灵来维系，由此得以纠正，至少被引导，他一分钟都活不下去，而是化为乌有。因为除了为自己的缘故而对自我、利益和名声的热爱，因而除了凡违反秩序的东西外，没有什么东西能抓住他。因此，他若不轻轻并逐渐通过对他自由的引导被带回秩序，就会立刻灭亡。</p>

It is provided by the Lord that spirits should flow into what is thought and willed by man, but angels into his ends, and thus through the ends into all that follows from the ends. Angels also flow in 
through good spirits into the goods of life and truths of faith with man, by means of which they lead him away from evils and falsities as far as possible. This influx is tacit, imperceptible to the 
man, but still operating and efficient in secret. Especially do they avert evil ends and insinuate good ones. But insofar as they cannot do this, they withdraw, and flow in more remotely, and more absently, 
and then evil spirits come nearer; for angels cannot be present in evil ends, that is, in the loves of self and of the world, and yet they are present from afar. [2] The Lord could through angels 
lead man into good ends by omnipotent force; but this would be to take away the man's life, for his life consists in entirely contrary loves. Therefore the Divine law is inviolable, that man shall 
be in freedom, and that good and truth, or charity and faith, shall be implanted in his freedom, and by no means in compulsion; because what is received in a state of compulsion does not remain, but 
is dissipated. For to compel a man is not to insinuate into his will, because it is then the will of another from which he acts; and therefore when he returns to his own will, that is, to his own freedom, 
this is rooted out. The Lord therefore rules man through his freedom, and as far as possible withholds him from the freedom of thinking and willing evil; for unless man were withheld by the Lord, 
he would be continually plunging into the deepest hell. [3] It was said that the Lord could through angels lead man into good ends by omnipotent force; for evil spirits can be driven away in an instant, 
even if there should be myriads about a man, and this indeed by means of one angel; but then the man would come into such torment and into such a hell that he could not possibly endure it, for he 
would be miserably deprived of his life. For the life of man is from cupidities and phantasies against good and truth. If this life were not sustained through evil spirits and thus amended, or at least 
led, he would be reduced to nothing and would not survive a minute. For nothing else is seated in him than the love of self and of gain, and of reputation for their sake, thus whatever is contrary 
to order. Wherefore unless he should be reduced into order moderately and by degrees, through the leading of his freedom, he would at once expire. </p>

The Lord sees to it that spirits should flow into a person's thoughts and desires, but that angels should flow into the ends he has in view and so through those ends into whatever ensues from them. The 
angels also flow by means of good spirits into the various good deeds he does in life and the truths he believes, and they use these to lead him away as far as possible from evils and falsities. This 
inflowing takes place silently, without the person knowing it; but even though it is hidden it works effectively. Above all the angels turn aside ends that are evil and introduce ones that are good. 
If this is not possible they withdraw; and the less possible it is, the further they withdraw and the more remote the position is from which they inflow, with the result that the evil spirits draw closer. 
For the angels cannot be present within evil ends, that is, within self-love and love of the world; even so, they remain present, but remotely so. </p>

<p><b>[2]</b>
 The Lord could by means of angels use almighty 
force to lead a person to have good ends in view; but that would be to take the person's life away from him, since his life consists of loves entirely contrary to those ends. It is therefore an 
inviolable law of God that a person should be left in freedom, and that goodness and truth, or charity and faith, should be implanted when he is in freedom, and by no means under compulsion. For what 
is received in a state of compulsion does not remain but disperses. Compelling a person to do something is not the same as instilling it into his will, for under compulsion the person must do someone 
else's will; when therefore his own will, that is, his own freedom, is restored to him, whatever was instilled under compulsion is rooted out. For this reason the Lord governs people by means of their 
freedom and restrains them as far as possible from the freedom of thinking and willing what is evil. For unless restrained by the Lord they would be constantly hurling themselves into the deepest hell. 
It has just been stated that the Lord could by means of angels use almighty force to lead a person to have good ends in view; for even if a person is surrounded by tens of thousands of evil spirits, 
they can be driven away in an instant, and it takes only one angel to do it. But then the person would go through such torment and hell that he could not possibly stand it, for his life would be wrenched 
from him. For a person's life consists of evil desires and false notions opposed to goodness and truth. Unless evil spirits were used to sustain and thereby correct that life, or at least to guide 
it, he could not survive one minute. For nothing else takes hold of him but love of self and of gain, and of reputation for selfish and gainful reasons, thus of whatever is contrary to order. So 
if he were not brought gently and gradually back to a state of order by having his freedom guided he would perish instantly. </p>

A Domino providetur ut spiritus influant in cogitata et voluntaria hominis, angeli vero in fines et sic per fines in illa quae a finibus sequuntur; (t)angeli etiam influunt per spiritus bonos in illa 
quae apud hominem bona vitae et vera fidei sunt, {1}per quae illum a malis et falsis quantum possibile abducunt, {2}influxus is est tacitus, {3}homini imperceptibilis, sed usque in occulto {4} operans 
et efficiens; {5}imprimis avertunt fines malos et insinuant bonos; quantum vero non possunt, removent se et influunt remotius {6}et absentius, et tunc propius accedunt spiritus mali; nam angeli in 
malis finibus, hoc est, in amoribus sui et mundi non adesse queunt, sed usque e longinquo adsunt. [2] Potuisset Dominus per angelos hominem ducere in bonos fines vi  omnipotenti; sed hoc foret vitam ei 
adimere, nam vita ejus est amorum prorsus contrariorum; quare lex Divina inviolabilis est quod homo erit in libero, et quod bonum et verum, seu charitas et fides, implantanda erunt in ejus libero, neutiquam 
in coacto; nam quod recipitur in statu coacto, hoc non manet sed dissipatur; cogere enim hominem non est insinuare in (t)ejus velle, est enim alterius velle ex quo faciet, quapropter cum ad suum 
velle, hoc est, ad suum liberum redit, exstirpatur; quapropter Dominus regit hominem per liberum ejus, et quantum possibile detinet a libero cogitandi et volendi malum; homo enim nisi detineretur 
a Domino, continue se in profundissimum infernum praecipitaret{7}. [3] (s)Dictum est quod potuisset Dominus per angelos ducere hominem in bonos fines vi omnipotenti, possunt enim mali spiritus momento 
abigi si vel forent myriades circum hominem, et quidem per unum angelum, sed tunc homo veniret in talem cruciatum et in tale infernum ut sustinere nequaquam posset{8}, nam vita sua misere deprivaretur; 
vita enim hominis est ex cupiditatibus et phantasiis contra bonum et verum; nisi per malos spiritus illa vita sustineretur, et sic emendaretur, ad minimum duceretur, ne minutum temporis superviveret; 
ei enim nihil aliud insidet quam amor sui et lucri, atque famae propter illa, ita quicquid est contra ordinem; quare nisi redigeretur in ordinem moderate, et per gradus, per ductum ejus liberi, exspiraret 
ilico.(s) @1 et sic$ @2 ita influxus$ @3 ab homine non perceptus$ @4 i est$ @5 angeli, quantum possint,$ @6 seu$ @7 i hoc fit per angelos$ @8 i sed moriretur$ </p>
