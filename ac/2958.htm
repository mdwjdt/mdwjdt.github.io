<h3 align="center" class="ired">属天的奥秘 第2958节</h3>
<h4 align="center"></h4><p><strong>2958.</strong>“我主请听”表接受的最初状态。这也可从下文清楚看出来，还可从前面所述（<a href="2945.htm">2945</a>节）明显可知，那里有同样的话。然而，那里的答复是不，而此处则同意了，不过仍有怀疑，因为下文紧接着说“在你我中间还算什么呢”，这表示他同意了，但仍渴望凭自己实现它。此外，“我主请听”纯粹是习惯用语，旨在引起别人的思考，然而它仍暗含出价的状态。</p>

<p align="center"><b>Potts(1905-1910) 2958</b></p><p><b>2958.</b>
My lord, hear me. That this signifies the first state of reception, is also evident from what follows, and also from what was said above (n. 2945) where the same words occur; there however there was 
denial, but here affirmation, although there is still doubt, for in what follows presently it is said, "What is that between me and thee?" by which is signified that he gave assent, but still desired 
it to be from himself. And besides, "My lord, hear me," is merely a customary form of speech intended to excite reflection in another, yet still it involves a state of making an offer. </p>

<p align="center"><b>Elliott(1983-1999) 2958</b></p><p><b>2958.</b>
'My lord, hear me' means the initial state of receptivity. This too is clear from what follows, as well as from what has been stated already in <a href="2945.htm">2945</a>, where the same words occur. There however the reply 
was No, whereas here it is affirmative, though still expressing doubt, for in what follows almost immediately come the words, 'What is that between me and you?' which means that he gave his assent 
yet still wished to achieve it by himself. What is more, 'My lord, hear me' is purely an expression used to lead another person to reflect, while yet implying a state in which a proposal is made. </p>

<p align="center"><b>Latin(1748-1756) 2958</b>
</p><b>2958.</b>
`Domine mi, audi me':  quod significet statum primum receptionis, etiam constat ab illis quae sequuntur, tum ab illis quae dicta prius n. 2945, ubi eadem verba; sed ibi negatio, hic autem affirmatio 
adhuc dubitativa, nam dicitur in mox sequentibus `inter me et inter te quid hoc,' quibus significatur quod annueret, sed vellet usque a semet:  praeterea `Domine mi, audi me' est modo formula excitandi 
alterius reflexionem, sed usque involvit statum propositionis. </p>
