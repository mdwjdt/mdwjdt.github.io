<h3 align="center" class="ired">属天的奥秘 第1869节</h3>
<h4 align="center"></h4><p><h4 align="center">圣经或圣言（续）</h4><br />1869.圣言的一句话到底包含多少事物，这一点已通过打开思想观念向我说明了。这是来世的奇事之一，也就是说，这一切以如此生动逼真的方式来完成，以致这些观念本身呈现为可见形式，因而如同彩色图像。在世时过着仁爱或相爱生活，并以圣言为大乐之人的观念就以这种方式被打开。然后，不计其数的美丽事物，连同动人的快乐愉悦之物出现了。我被告知，如此显为可见的事物若进一步被打开，直到它们的内层，那么，这些内层一旦被打开，就会有更美丽、快乐的事物呈现出来，同时伴随着幸福本身。所有天使观念都是如此，因为它们通过主自己敞开。<br />对惊讶于思想观念在来世能如此被打开的灵人，这个问题是通过肉眼的视觉来说明的。肉眼的视力如此暗淡、模糊，以致自然界中包含无数细节的较小事物在肉眼看来就象某种没有光泽、形状的乌黑物体。但是，当通过显微镜来观察这个物体时，更内层的事物就会显为可见。它们以优美的序列相互联结，并流动着令人愉悦的次序。若用性能更好的显微镜来观察，就会看到这些内层以同样的方式被进一步打开。这个例子清楚表明内视的性质，其视力无非是观念，因为这些观念本身如此粗糙，以致在这个领域，几乎再没有更粗糙的事物了，尽管世人不这么想。关于观念的更多内容，蒙主怜悯，将在后面予以阐述。</p>

<p><strong>[NCE]1869.</strong> HOW much a single word of Scripture contains has been shown to me by a revelation of people's individual ideas. Surprising to say, ideas can be revealed so vividly in the other world that they actually become visible and take on a shape, as if they were images in a painting.<br />One individual whose ideas were revealed in this way was a person who had lived a life of charity, or mutual love, and had taken pleasure in the Word during his time in the world. When his thoughts were revealed, countless beautiful objects appeared, bringing with them a delight and pleasure that touched the heart. I learned that these visible manifestations have further inward layers that can be revealed, and when they are revealed, sights still more beautiful and delightful present themselves, bringing happiness itself with them. All angelic ideas are like this, because the Lord himself lays them open.<br />[2] Physical vision was used to illustrate this principle for a group of spirits who were amazed that a person's individual thoughts can be revealed this way in the other world. The sight of the eye is so weak and dim that it sees the smaller objects of the physical world simply as spots, dark and shapeless, although they hold within them too many parts to count. When the same objects are observed through a microscope, however, the inward parts come into focus, connected in a beautiful series and flowing from each other in an elegant pattern. These parts likewise could be laid open by an even stronger microscope. This showed what the case is with the inner eye, whose lines of sight are nothing but ideas: in themselves these ideas are about as hazy as anything can be in that realm — although human beings think otherwise. I will have more to say about people's ideas below, however, with the Lord's divine mercy [<a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_1869/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_1971" target=_top>1971</a>, <a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_1869/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_1980" target=_top>1980</a>, <a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_1869/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_1981" target=_top>1981</a>]. </p>

CONTINUATION CONCERNING THE HOLY SCRIPTURE OR WORD How many things there are in a single word of the Word has been shown me by the opening of the ideas of thought. It is a remarkable fact that in the 
other life this can be done so to the very life that the ideas themselves appear visible in form, and thus like pictured images. One who during his life in this world had lived in charity or mutual 
love, and had taken great delight in the Word, had his ideas thus opened. There then appeared beautiful things beyond number, together with delicious and delightful things of an affecting nature, and 
it was said that the things which thus appear visible can be opened again as to their interiors, and that when these have been opened things still more beautiful and delightful are presented that are 
attended with happiness itself. Such are all angelic ideas, for they are open from the Lord Himself. [2] To spirits who wondered that ideas of thought could be so opened in the other life, this was illustrated 
by taking the case of the sight of the eye, the rays of vision of which are so dull and obscure that the smaller things in nature (which contain things innumerable) they see only as something 
opaque, black, and shapeless; but when the same objects are viewed through a microscope, things more interior are presented to view, connected in beautiful series and flowing in delightful order; and 
it is seen that these might in like manner be opened still more by a more powerful microscope. In this way such spirits have been shown how the case is with the internal sight, the rays of which are 
nothing but ideas, in that in themselves these ideas are so gross that anything more gross can scarcely exist in that sphere, although men think differently. But concerning ideas, of the Lord's Divine 
mercy hereafter.  </p>

SACRED SCRIPTURE OR THE WORD - continued </p>
<p>How many things are contained within a single expression of the Word has been demonstrated to me by an opening up to view of the ideas that comprise thought. 
In the next life this can be done - it being one of the marvels there - in so vivid a way that the ideas themselves may be seen in visible form, thus as coloured images so to speak. The ideas belonging 
to one who had led a life of charity or mutual love, and who during his lifetime had taken great delight in the Word, were opened up to view in that manner. Countless things that were beautiful were 
seen, together with those which were movingly delightful and pleasant. I was told that the things which are seen within such visible forms may be opened up further again as to their interiors, and 
once these have been opened, that still more beautiful and delightful things are manifested, together with those that constitute happiness itself. All angelic ideas are such, for they are laid open from 
the Lord Himself. </p>

<p><b>[2]</b>
 To spirits who were surprised that in the next life the ideas comprising thought can be opened to view in such a manner, this matter was illustrated by taking as an example 
the sight of the eye, of which the powers of vision are so dull and dim that the smaller things of the natural world which have countless details in them are not seen except as something opaque, black, 
and patternless. But when the same objects are looked at under a microscope, things that are more interior are brought to view, linked one to another in a lovely sequence, and flowing in a delightful 
order. At the same time it was recognized that those objects too could have been opened up further still by a more powerful microscope. This illustration made clear the nature of internal sight, of 
which the powers of vision are nothing other than ideas; for in themselves those ideas are so gross that scarcely anything more gross is able to exist in that sphere, though man thinks otherwise. But 
more regarding ideas will in the Lord's Divine mercy be stated later on. </p>

Continuatio de Scriptura Sacra seu Verbo </p>
<p>Ostensum mihi est quam multa uni voci Verbi insunt, per id quod ideae cogitationis apertae sint; in altera vita, quod mirabile, hoc fieri potest ita ad vivum 
ut ipsae ideae appareant visibiles in forma, sic quasi pictae imagines: apertae fuerunt ita ideae unius qui in charitate seu amore mutuo vixit, et delectatus fuit cum vixit in mundo, Verbo; tunc apparuerunt 
innumerabilia pulchra cum deliciosis et jucundis afficientibus; dictum quod haec quae ita apparent visibilia, iterum quoad interiora possint aperiri, quibus apertis quod adhuc pulchriora et 
deliciosiora cum ipsis felicibus sisterentur; omnes ideae angelicae tales sunt, nam illae apertae sunt ab Ipso Domino.  [2] Illustratum hoc coram spiritibus qui mirati quod in altera vita ita ideae cogitationis 
aperiri queant, per visam oculi, cujus visionis radii tam hebetes et obscuri sunt, ut minora naturae in quibus innumerabilia, non aliter videant ac opacum quoddam et nigrum informe; at cum 
per microscopium eadem spectantur, sistuntur videnda interiora, pulchra serie connexa, et jucundo ordine fluentia; et quod haec similiter per acutius microscopium adhuc potuissent aperiri; ex his constare 
potuit quomodo se habet cum visu interno, cujus radii non alii sunt quam ideae, quod in se tam crassae sint, ut vix crassius in illa sphaera dari queat, tametsi homo aliter putat: sed de ideis, 
ex Divina Domini Misericordi in sequentibus. </p>
