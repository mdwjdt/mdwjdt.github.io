<h3 align="center" class="ired">属天的奥秘 第8802节</h3>
<h4 align="center"></h4><p><strong>8802.</strong>“到角声拖长的时候”表那些拥有对属天良善的一种总体感知的人。这从“角声拖长的时候”的含义清楚可知。“角声拖长的时候”，或也可说，当听见号角声时，是指对属天良善的一种总体感知；因为“听见”表示感知（<a href="5017.htm">5017</a>，<a href="8361.htm">8361</a>节），“角声”或“号角声”表示属天良善。“号角声”或“角声”之所以表示属天良善，是因为乐器凭它们的声音而对应于对真理或良善的情感；弦乐器对应于对真理的情感，管乐器对应于对良善的情感（<a href="418.htm">418</a>-<a href="420.htm">420</a>，<a href="4138.htm">4138</a>，<a href="8337.htm">8337</a>节）。号角作为一种声音响亮的管乐器，对应于对属天良善的情感；这也是为什么代表至内层天堂的良善与真理的婚姻的禧年因它而得名。正因如此，“到角声拖长的时候”表示那些拥有对属天良善的一种总体感知的人。<br />“那些拥有对属天良善的一种总体感知的人”是指在主的属天国度和属灵国度之间的中间人，因此流注、交流和结合通过他们实现（参看<a href="8787.htm">8787</a>，<a href="8796.htm">8796</a>节）。“他们才可上山”表示他们拥有一路直到属天社群那里的延伸。这些中间人由“摩西”（<a href="8787.htm">8787</a>节），以及“亚伦”来代表，他们二人被恩准上山（19:24）。至于何为直到天使社群气场的这种延伸，以及每个人延伸的性质取决于他的良善，可参看前文（<a href="8794.htm">8794</a>节）。总体感知存在于那些处于属灵良善，能接受更高天堂，在这种情况下能接受至内层天堂的良善的一种总体流注的人身上。当听见角声时，那些可以上山的人就表示这些人。</p>

When the jobel* is drawn out. That this signifies with those who have a general perception of celestial good, is evident from the signification of "when the jobel is drawn out," or what is the same, 
when the sound of the trumpet is heard, as being a general perception of celestial good; for by "being heard" is signified perception (n. 5017, 8361), and by "the jobel," or "sound of the trumpet," is 
signified celestial good. The reason why celestial good is signified by "the sound of the trumpet," or "the jobel," is that from their sounds musical instruments correspond to affections of truth and 
good; stringed instruments to affections of truth, and wind instruments to affections of good (n. 418-420, 4138, 8337). The trumpet, being a wind instrument, and high-sounding, corresponded to the affection 
of celestial good; wherefore also the "jubilee," by which was represented the marriage of good and truth which is in the inmost heaven, was named therefrom. Therefore now it is, that by "when 
the jobel is drawn out," is signified those who have a general perception of celestial good. By those who are in a general perception of celestial good are meant those who are intermediate between the 
Lord's celestial kingdom and His spiritual kingdom, through whom therefore are effected influx, communication, and conjunction (see just above, n. 8787, 8796). These have extension even into the celestial 
societies, which is signified by "they shall come up into the mountain." These intermediate ones are represented by Moses (n. 8787), and also by Aaron, to whom it was granted to go up into the mountain 
(see verse 24). (What is this extension into the spheres of angelic societies, and that everyone's extension is such as his good is, see n. 8794.) General perception exists with those who are 
in spiritual good and can receive a general influx of the good of a higher heaven, in this case, of the inmost heaven. Such are meant by "those who shall come up into the mountain when the jobel is heard." * 
The Hebrew word jobel, here retained by Swedenborg, means the sound of a trumpet," as defined just below.[Reviser.] </p>

'When there is a long sounding with the jobel'' means those who have a general perception of celestial good. This is clear from the meaning of 'when there is a long sounding with the jobel', or what 
amounts to the same thing, 'when the sound of the trumpet is heard', as a general perception of celestial good; for 'being heard' means perception, <a href="5017.htm">5017</a>, <a href="8361.htm">8361</a>, and 'the jobel' or 'the sound of the trumpet' 
means celestial good. The reason why 'the sound of the trumpet' or 'the jobel' means celestial good is that by virtue of the sounds they make musical instruments correspond to affections for truth 
or affections for good, stringed instruments corresponding to affections for truth, and wind to affections for good, <a href="418.htm">418</a> <a href="420.htm">420</a>, <a href="4138.htm">4138</a>, <a href="8337.htm">8337</a>. Being a wind instrument, a loud sounding one, the trumpet corresponded 
to an affection for celestial good, which also was why a jubilee, which represented the marriage of goodness and truth in the inmost heaven, took its name from it. So it is that 'a long sounding 
with the jobel' means those who have a general perception of celestial good. </p>

<p><b>[2]</b>
 The words 'those who have a general perception of celestial good' are used to mean the intermediaries who are 
positioned between the Lord's celestial kingdom and His spiritual kingdom, and who are therefore those through whom influx, communication, and joining together are accomplished, see just above in <a href="8787.htm">8787</a>, <a href="8796.htm">8796</a>. They have extension all the way into celestial communities, meant by the words 'they shall go up into the mountain'. These intermediaries are represented by 'Moses', <a href="8787.htm">8787</a>, and also by 'Aaron', 
who were allowed to go up into the mountain, verse 24 below. What extension into the spheres of angelic communities is, and that the nature of each person's extension is determined by his good, see 
above in <a href="8794.htm">8794</a>. A general perception exists with those who are governed by spiritual good and are able to receive a general influx of good from a higher heaven, in this instance the inmost heaven. Such 
are meant by those who shall go up [into] the mountain when the jobel is heard. </p>

`In trahendo jobel': quod significet quibus perceptio communis boni caelestis, constat ex significatione `in trahendo jobel,' seu quod idem, `in audiendo sonum buccinae,' quod sit perceptio communis 
boni caelestis, per `audiri' enim significatur perceptio, n. 5017, 8361, et per `jobel' seu `sonum buccinae' significatur bonum caeleste; causa quod per `sonum buccinae' seu `jobel' significetur bonum 
caeleste, est quia instrumenta musica ex sonis {1}suis correspondeant affectionibus veri {2}aut boni, instrumenta chordacea affectionibus veri, et inflatoria affectionibus boni, n. 418-420, 4138, 8337; 
buccina quia erat instrumentum inflatorium et grandisonum, {3}correspondebat affectioni boni caelestis, quare etiam jubilaeum inde nominatum est, per quod repraesentatum est conjugium {4}boni et veri 
quod in intimo caelo {5}; inde nunc est quod per `in trahendo jobel' significetur quibus perceptio communis boni caelestis. 	2 Per illos qui in perceptione communi boni caelestis (x)intelliguntur 
qui intermedii sunt inter regnum caeleste et regnum spirituale Domini, per quos ideo influxus, communicatio, et conjunctio fit, videatur mox supra n. 8787, 8796; his est extensio usque in societates 
caelestes, {6}quae significatur per quod illi ascendent in montem; intermedii illi repraesentantur per `Moschen,' n.  8787, et quoque per `Aharonem,' quibus datum est in montem ascendere, vers. 24 seq. 
 Quid extensio in sphaeras societatum angelicarum, et quod talis sit extensio quale bonum cuivis, videatur supra n. 8794.  Communis perceptio est apud illos qui in spirituali bono sunt, (c)et influxum 
communem {7}boni caeli superioris, hic caeli intimi, recipere possunt; tales {8} intelliguntur per illos qui ascendent montem `in audiendo jobel.' 	@1 illorum$ 	@2 et IT$ 	@3 correspondebat altered
