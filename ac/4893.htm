<h3 align="center" class="ired">属天的奥秘 第4893节</h3>
<h4 align="center"></h4><p><strong>4893.</strong>“这里并没有妓女”表它不是虚假。这从“妓女”的含义清楚可知，“妓女”是指虚假，如前所述（<a href="4890.htm">4890</a>节）。就这些话的含义而言，目前所阐述的这一系列事包含什么，可从前面所述（<a href="4865.htm">4865</a>，<a href="4868.htm">4868</a>，<a href="4874.htm">4874</a>节）在某种程度上明显看出来。此外，它们是若不知道内在真理与犹太教会的外在真理的结合的性质，无论是“他玛”所代表的内在真理那一边的，还是“犹大”所代表的外在那一边的，就无法被理解的那种事。由于这些都是根本不为人知的事，所以若进一步加以解释，它们就会落入心智的阴影部分，因而落入没有任何理解它们的观念存在之地；因为理解力，也就是内在人所拥有的视觉能力，拥有它的光明和阴影；那些与心智之前对其有某种概念之物不一致的事物会落入它的阴影中。然而，所有这一系列的细节，连同无法被人理解的无数事物，都清晰地进入天使的理解之光中。由此明显可知，相比世人的聪明，天使的聪明何等之大，又何等卓越。</p>

There was no harlot there. That this signifies that it was not falsity, is evident from the signification of a "harlot," as being falsity, as above (n. 4890). What these things which have thus far been 
unfolded in respect to the signification of the words, involve in a series, may in some measure appear from what has been said above (n. 4865, 4868, 4874); and, moreover, they are things which cannot 
be comprehended unless the nature of the conjunction between internal truth and the external truth of the Jewish Church is known, both on the part of the internal truth represented by Tamar, and on 
the part of the external represented by Judah. As these are unknown they would fall into shade if further unfolded, thus into no idea of the understanding; for the understanding, which is the sight of 
the internal man, has its light and its shade, and those things fall into its shade which do not coincide with what it has had some notion of before. Yet all these particulars in a series, together 
with innumerable things which cannot even be comprehended by man, enter clearly into the light of the understanding of the angels. From this then it is evident how great and how excellent is angelic intelligence 
in comparison with that of man. </p>

'There has been no harlot there' means that it was not something false. This is clear from the meaning of 'a harlot' or a prostitute as something false, as above in <a href="4890.htm">4890</a>. What train of thought runs through 
the expressions, of which until now only explanations of their individual meanings has been given, may be to a certain extent evident from what has been stated above in <a href="4865.htm">4865</a>, <a href="4868.htm">4868</a>, <a href="4874.htm">4874</a>. They are, 
what is more, the kind of matters that are unintelligible unless one knows what the joining together of internal truth and the external of the Jewish Church is like - both on the side of the internal 
truth represented by 'Tamar' and that of the external represented by 'Judah'. Because these are matters about which nothing at all is known, any further explanation of them would enter the unlit parts 
of the mind, and so where no ideas exist to understand them; for the understanding, which is the power of sight the internal man possesses, has its own lit and unlit parts. The unlit are the parts 
where things enter that do not conform in any way at all with anything of which the mind already has some conception. Nevertheless each specific meaning in the train of thought so far, together with 
countless matters which man cannot even begin to comprehend, enter with clarity the lit parts of angels' understandings. From this one may see what angelic intelligence is like and how much greater it 
is compared with that of men. </p>

'Non fuit ibi scortum': quod significet quod non falsum, constat a significatione `scorti' seu meretricis quod sit falsum, ut supra n. 4890. Quid haec quae hactenus quoad significationes vocum explicata 
sunt, in serie involvunt, patere aliqualiter potest ab illis quae supra n. 4865, 4868, 4874 dicta sunt; et praeterea sunt talia quae non capi possunt nisi sciatur {1} qualis conjunctio est inter 
verum internum et externum Ecclesiae Judaicae, tam a parte veri interni quod repraesentatur per `Tamarem', quam a parte externi quod repraesentatur per `Jehudam'; haec quia inter ignota sunt, 
si ulterius explicarentur, caderent in umbram, ita in nullam intellectus ideam; intellectus enim, qui est vicus interni hominis, habet suam lucem et suam umbram, in umbram ejus cadunt quae non coincidunt 
cum illis, de quibus prius aliquam notionem habuit; {2} sed usque singula haec in serie, cum innumerabilibus quae ne quidem comprehendi possunt ab homine, in lucem intellectus angelorum clare intrant; 
inde qualis et quanta est intelligentia angelica respective, patet. @1 quale conjugiale, seu$ @2 i tale est conjugiale inter internum et externum Ecclesiae Judaicae.  This and the previous 
omission suggest that the union of internum et externum is not to be regarded as conjugiale.$ </p>
