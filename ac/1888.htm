<h3 align="center" class="ired">属天的奥秘 第1888节</h3>
<h4 align="center"></h4><p><strong>1888.</strong>我们可用两个例子来说明圣言的字义是神性奥秘的代表，并且也是主的属天和属灵之物的容器和宝库：一是“大卫”并非指大卫，而是指主；二是名字只表示真实事物，因此圣言的其它部分必然也一样。关于大卫，以西结书上说：<br />我的仆人大卫必作他们的王，他们全体只有一个牧人。他们和他们的子孙，并子孙的子孙，都永远住在那地。我的仆人大卫必作他们的王，直到永远。（以西结书<a href="http://39-27.cn/结37.24.htm">37:24</a>，<a href="http://39-27.cn/结37.25.htm">25</a>）<br />何西阿书：<br />后来以色列人必归回，寻求他们的神耶和华和他们的王大卫。（何西阿书<a href="http://39-27.cn/何3.5.htm">3:5</a>）<br />记载这些应许的先知所生活的年代晚于大卫时代，然而他们明确说明，他必作“他们的王和君王”。谁都能由此看出，“大卫”的内义是指主。所有其它经文也一样，甚至包括提到大卫名字的历史部分。<br />王、地区、城、人等的名均表示真实事物，这清楚可见于先知书。仅举以赛亚书这个例子：<br />所以主万军之耶和华如此说，住锡安我的百姓啊，亚述王虽然用棍击打你，又照埃及的样子举杖攻击你，你却不要怕他。万军之耶和华要兴起鞭来攻击他，好像在俄立磐石那里杀戮米甸人一样。耶和华的杖要向海伸出，把杖举起，像在埃及一样。亚述王来到亚叶，经过米矶仑，在密抹安放辎重。他们过了隘口，在迦巴住宿。拉玛人战兢，扫罗的基比亚人逃跑。迦琳的女子哪，要高声呼喊！莱煞人哪，须听！哀哉，困苦的亚拿突啊！玛得米那人躲避，基柄的居民避难。当那日，亚述王要在挪伯歇兵，向锡安女子的山，就是耶路撒冷的山岗，抡手攻她。他将用铁斧砍伐丛林，黎巴嫩和她的壮丽必被伐倒。（以赛亚书<a href="http://39-27.cn/赛10.24.htm">10:24</a>，<a href="http://39-27.cn/赛10.26.htm">26</a>-<a href="http://39-27.cn/赛10.34.htm">34</a>）<br />这几节经文几乎全都是名字，若非所有名字都表示真实事物，这些名字毫无意义可言。若心思专注于这些名字，就不会承认这是主的圣言。但是，谁会相信就内义而言，它们全都包含天堂的奥秘？或它们描述的是那些试图通过基于记忆知识的推理而探究信的秘密之人的状态呢？亦或每个名字描述的是属于该状态的某个具体方面呢？又或主藉着爱的属天事物和信的属灵事物驱散这些推理呢？此处所论述的“亚述”表推理，这从前面有关“亚述”的说明（<a href="119.htm">119</a>，<a href="1186.htm">1186</a>节）清楚可知；前面还说明，“埃及”表记忆知识（<a href="1164.htm">1164</a>，<a href="1165.htm">1165</a>，<a href="1462.htm">1462</a>节）。看看这些经文，仔细想一想是不是这种情况。所有其它名字，以及所有其它话也一样。</p>

That the sense of the letter of the Word is representative of Divine arcana, and that it is the receptacle and thus the repository of the Lord's celestial and spiritual things, may be illustrated by 
two examples: first, that by "David" is not meant David, but the Lord; second, that the names signify nothing but actual things, and therefore it must be the same with all the rest of the Word. Concerning 
David it is said in Ezekiel: </p>
<p>     My servant David shall be king over them, and they shall all have one shepherd; they shall dwell upon the land, they and their sons and their sons' sons, even to 
eternity; and David my servant shall be their prince to eternity (Ezek. 37:24-25). And in Hosea: </p>
<p>     The sons of Israel shall return, and shall seek Jehovah their God, and David their king (Hos. 
3:5). These things were written by the prophets after the time of David, and yet it is plainly said that he shall be their king and prince, from which all may see that in the internal sense it is the 
Lord who is meant by "David." And the case is the same in all other passages, even those which are historical, where David is named.  [2] That the names of kingdoms, regions, cities, and men, signify 
actual things, may be clearly seen in the Prophets. Take merely this example in Isaiah: </p>
<p>     Thus said the Lord, Jehovih Zebaoth, O My people, thou inhabitant of Zion, be not afraid of Asshur; he shall 
smite thee with a rod, and shall lift up his staff upon thee in the way of Egypt. Jehovah of Armies shall stir up a scourge for him according to the plague of Midian at the rock of Horeb; and as 
His rod was upon the sea, so shall He lift it up in the way of Egypt. He shall come against Aiath, He shall pass over to Migron, at Michmash shall He command His arms; they* shall pass over Mabarah; Geba* 
is a lodging-place for us; Ramah* shall tremble; Gibeah of Saul shall flee; cry aloud with thy voice, O daughter of Gallim; hearken, O Laish; O thou poor Anathoth; Madmenah shall wander; the inhabitants 
of Gebim shall gather themselves together; as yet there is a day for a stand at Nob; the mountain of the daughter of Zion, the hill of Jerusalem, shall shake her hand; He shall cut down the thickets 
of the forest with iron, and Lebanon shall fall by a magnificent one (Isa. 10:24, 26-34). [3] Here there is almost nothing but names, from which no sense would appear unless all the names signified 
actual things; and if the mind were to abide in the names, this would never be acknowledged to be the Word of the Lord. But who will believe that in the internal sense they all contain arcana of 
heaven? and that by them is described the state of those who are endeavoring to enter into the mysteries of faith by reasonings from memory-knowledges? Some special thing belonging to that state are 
described by each name; and that the meaning is that these reasonings are dispersed by the Lord by means of the celestial things of love and the spiritual things of faith. That the reasoning here treated 
of is signified by "Asshur," may be clearly seen from what has been already shown concerning Asshur (n. 119, 1186); also that memory-knowledges are signified by "Egypt" (n. 1164, 1165, 1462); which 
see and examine. The case is the same with all other names, and also with all the several words. * The Latin had transibit, Gibea, Chormah: but in the Doctrine of the Holy Scripture, n. 15, we find 
transibunt, Geba, and Ramah, like the Hebrew. [Rotch. ed.] </p>

To illustrate that the sense of the letter of the Word is representative of Divine arcana and is the receptacle of, and thus the storehouse containing, celestial and spiritual things which are the Lord's, 
let two examples be taken, which will consequently reveal the position with all else The first example shows that David is not used to mean David but the Lord, the second that names mean nothing 
other than real things. Of David the following is said in Ezekiel, </p>
<p>My servant David will be King over them, and they will all have one Shepherd. They will dwell in the land, they, and their sons, 
and their sons' sons even for ever And David my servant will be their Prince for ever. <a href="http://bible.gospelcom.net/cgi-bin/bible?passage=Ezek%2037:24,%2025&amp;version=ESV&amp;interface=print&amp;showfn=yes&amp;showxref">Ezek 37:24, 25</a>. </p>
<p>And in Hosea, </p>
<blockquote>
The children of Israel will return and seek Jehovah their God, and David their 
king. <a href="http://bible.gospelcom.net/cgi-bin/bible?passage=Hosea%203:5&amp;version=ESV&amp;interface=print&amp;showfn=yes&amp;showxref">Hosea 3:5</a>. 
</blockquote>
<p>These promises were written by prophets who lived later than David, yet it is explicitly stated by them that he 'will be' their king and prince. From this it may become clear to 
anyone that in the internal sense David means the Lord. The same applies in all other places, including the historical descriptions, where David is referred to by name. </p>
<p></p>
<p><b>[2]</b>
 As regards the names of 
kingdoms, regions, cities, and men meaning real things, this becomes quite clear in the Prophets. Take this single example in Isaiah, </p>
<blockquote>
Thus said the Lord, Jehovih Zebaoth, Do not be afraid - O My people, 
inhabitant of Zion - of Asshur; he will smite you with a rod, and he will lift up the staff over you in the way of Egypt. Jehovah Zebaoth will lift up the scourge over him, as when Midian was smitten 
in the rock of Horeb, and his rod will be over the sea, and he will lift it up in the way of Egypt. He will come against Aiath; he will pass over into Migron; he will command his arms towards Michmash. 
They will cross the Mabarah. Geba will be a lodging-place for us. Hormah<A name="fntext1"></a><A href="#fn1"><sup>a</sup></a> will tremble. Gibeah of Saul will flee. Make a noise with your voice, O daughter of Gallim. Hearken, O Laish. Wail, O 
Anathoth. Madmenah will wander about. The inhabitants of Gebim will gather themselves together. This very day he is in Nob to stay. The mountain of the daughter of Zion, the hill of Jerusalem, will shake 
her fist. He will cut down the entangled boughs of the wood with an axe, and Lebanon will fall by a majestic one. <a href="http://bible.gospelcom.net/cgi-bin/bible?passage=Isa%2010:24,%2026-34&amp;version=ESV&amp;interface=print&amp;showfn=yes&amp;showxref">Isa 10:24, 26-34</a>. 
</blockquote>

<p><b>[3]</b>
 These verses include little more than mere names, which 
would not make any sense at all if, without exception, those names did not mean real things; and if the mind remained fixed on those names, no acknowledgement that it was the Word of the Lord would ever 
be made. But who is going to believe that all those names in the internal sense contain arcana of heaven? Or that through them the state of people is described who endeavour by means of reasonings 
based on facts to penetrate the mysteries of faith? Or that by means of each name some particular aspect of that state is described? Or that those reasonings are dispersed by the Lord by means of the 
celestial things of love and the spiritual things of faith? That 'Asshur' means reasoning, which is the subject in these verses from Isaiah, becomes quite clear from what has been shown regarding 'Asshur' 
in <a href="119.htm">119</a>, <a href="1186.htm">1186</a>; and that 'Egypt' means factual knowledge, from what has been shown in <a href="1164.htm">1164</a>, <a href="1165.htm">1165</a>, <a href="1462.htm">1462</a>. See these paragraphs and consider whether or not this is true. It is the same with all other 
names, and with individual expressions.

Quod sensus litterae Verbi sit repraesentativus arcanorum Divinorum et quod sit receptaculum et sic reconditorium {1} caelestium et spiritualium Domini, illustrare licet binis exemplis; uno quod per 
Davidem non intelligatur David, sed Dominus; altero quod nomina nihil aliud significent quam res; consequenter reliqua. De Davide ita dicitur apud Ezechielem, 	Servus meus David Rex super eos, et Pastor 
unus erit omnibus illis:... habitabunt super terra... illi, et filii illorum, et filii filiorum illorum usque in aeternum; et David servus meus Princeps illis in aeternum, xxxvii 24, 25: </p>
<p>et apud 
Hosheam, 	Revertentur filii Israelis, et quaerent Jehovam Deum 	suum, et Davidem regem suum, iii 5. Haec a prophetis illis scripta sunt post Davidis tempus, et tamen aperte dicitur quod is erit rex 
et princeps illorum, ex quibus unicuique constare potest quod per Davidem in sensu interno intelligatur Dominus; ita in ceteris locis, etiam in historicis, ubi David nominatur.  [2] Quod nomina regnorum, 
regionum, urbium, virorum, (x)significent res, constare potest evidenter apud Prophetas; pro exemplo sit solum hoc apud Esaiam, 	Sic dixit Dominus, Jehovih Zebaoth, Ne timeas popule Mi, habitator 
Zionis, ab Asshure; virga percutiet te, et baculum tollet super te in via Aegypti Excitabit super eum Jehovah Zebaoth flagellum, juxta plagam Midianis, in petra Horeb, et baculum tollet super mari, 
et tollet eum in via Aegypti:... veniet contra Ajath; transibit in Migronem; ad Michmash mandabit armis suis; transibunt Mabaram {2}; Gibea diversorium nobis; trepidabit Hormah {3}; Gibeah Shaulis fugiet; 
intona 	voce tua filia Gallim; ausculta Laish; misera Anathoth; vagabitur Madmenah habitatores Gebim congregabunt se; adhuc dies est in Nob ad consistendum; agitabit manum suam mons filiae Zionis, 
collis Hierosolymae,... succidet implexa silvae ferro, et Libanus per magnificum cadet, x 24, (x)26-34. [3] Hic sunt paene mera nomina, ex quibus non aliquis sensus prodiret nisi nomina singula significarent 
res; sique nominibus istis inhaereret mens, nusquam agnosceretur quod Verbum Domini foret.  Sed quis credet quod omnia illa in sensu interno contineant arcana caeli? et quod per illa describatur 
status eorum qui per ratiocinia ex scientificis intrare conantur in mysteria fidei? et quod per unumquodvis nomen aliquid speciale illius status describatur; (m)tum quod ratiocinia illa discutiantur 
per caelestia amoris et spiritualia fidei a Domino(n)? Quod per `Asshurem' significetur ratiocinatio, de qua hic agitur, constare manifeste potest ab illis quae de Asshure ostensa sunt, n. 119, 1186; 
et quod per `Aegyptum' scientifica, ab illis quae n. 1164, 1165, 1462, quae videantur et examinentur annon ita se habeat; similiter se habet cum ceteris nominibus, et similiter cum singulis vocibus. 	@1 
i rerum.$ 	@2 So Sch. but Hebrew [ ] (ma`barah)=`passage' or `ford'. A.V. has passage.  R.V. pass.$ 	@3 This seems to be an error in Sch. which S. has copied Hebrew is Haramah.  A.V. has S. 
in S.S. 15.$ </p>
