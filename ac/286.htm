<p><strong>[NCE]286.</strong> Inner Meaning<br />UP to this point the text has been dealing with the very earliest people and their regeneration. First it spoke of those who lived like animals and finally became spiritual people. Next it spoke of those who became heavenly people — the ones who made up that earliest church. Then it turned to those who fell away, and their heirs, tracing them in order: the first generation to inherit, the second, the third, and lastly those that followed, right up to the Flood.<br />These verses at the end of the chapter contain a review extending from the people of the earliest church up to the time of the Flood, which brings closure to all that came before. </p>
<p align="center"><b>Potts(1905-1910) 286</b></p><p><b>286.</b>
THE INTERNAL SENSE. This and the preceding chapters, down to the verses now under consideration, treat of the most ancient people and of their regeneration; first, of those who lived like wild animals, 
but at length became spiritual men; then of those who became celestial men, and constituted the Most Ancient Church; afterwards of those who fell away, and their descendants, in regular order through 
the first, second, and third posterities and their successors, down to the flood. In the verses following, which conclude the chapter, we have a recapitulation of what occurred from the period when 
the man of the Most Ancient Church was formed, until the flood; thus it is a conclusion to all that goes before. </p>

<p align="center"><b>Elliott(1983-1999) 286</b></p><p><b>286.</b>
THE INTERNAL SENSE  Up to now the subject has been the most ancient people and their regeneration. Those who lived as wild animals who subsequently became spiritual men were dealt with first, then those 
who became celestial and constituted the Most Ancient Church. After that the subject concerned those among them, and their descendants, who regressed dealing in order with the first, second, and 
third generations of these descendants, and finally with those who followed them, down to the Flood. The verses which follow from here to the end of the chapter are a recapitulation concerning members 
of the Most Ancient Church down to the Flood, and so are the conclusion to all that has gone before.  </p>

SENSUS INTERNUS </p>
<p>IN praecedentibus huc usque actum est de antiquissimis, quod regenerati; primum de iis qui sicut ferae vixerunt et tandem facti homines spirituales; tum de illis qui facti homines 
caelestes, qui Antiquissimam Ecclesiam constituerunt; postea de iis, et posteris, qui recesserunt, ordine, de prima posteritate, de secunda, de tertia, et demum de sequentibus usque ad diluvium. In his 
versibus qui sequuntur ad finem hujus capitis est recapitulatio ab Antiquissimae Ecclesiae homine usque ad diluvium; ita est conclusio omnium praecedentium. </p>
