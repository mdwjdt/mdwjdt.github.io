<h3 align="center" class="ired">属天的奥秘 第10513节</h3>
<h4 align="center"></h4><p>星空中的第三个星球-续<br /><strong>10513</strong>.宏伟的宫殿展现在这个星球的灵人面前，类似我们地球上的国王和王子所住的宫殿；因为这类物体能展现在灵人眼前，当它们被展现时，看上去完全是真的。但来自这个星球的灵人根据不欣赏它们，称其为大理石雕像。然后他们声称，他们有比这更壮观的东西；这些是他们的圣殿，但不是石头建的，而是木头建的。当被告知，这些圣殿也都是世俗之物时，他们回答说，它们不是世俗的，而是天上的，因为当观看它们时，他们脑海里没有任何世俗的观念，而是有某种天上的观念，相信自己死后在天上还会看到这类物体。</p>

CONTINUATION ABOUT THE THIRD EARTH IN THE STARRY HEAVEN. There were represented before the spirits of that earth magnificent palaces, after the likeness of those in which kings and princes dwell on 
our earth; for such things can be represented before spirits, and when represented they appear exactly as if they were real. But the spirits from that earth held them in no estimation, calling them marble 
effigies. And then they told us that with them there are things more magnificent, but that these are their holy edifices, not of stone, but of wood. And when it was said to them that these too are 
earthly things, they answered that they are not earthly, but heavenly, because when they behold them they have not an earthly idea, but a heavenly one, believing that they will see the like in heaven 
after death. </p>

THE THIRD PLANET OUT IN SPACE - continued  </p>
<p>Magnificent palaces were represented before the eyes of the spirits belonging to that planet, resembling those inhabited by kings and princes on ours; 
for such objects can be represented before the eyes of spirits, and when they are represented they look totally real. But the spirits from that planet did not admire them at all; they called them marble 
imitations. Theirs, they declared, were more magnificent; but these were their sacred houses or temples, constructed not of stone but wood. And when they were told that for all that those temples were 
earthly they replied that they were not so, but were heavenly, because when they look at them they do not have anything earthly in mind but something heavenly, believing that they will see objects 
like this in heaven after death.  </p>

Continuatio de Tertia Tellure in Caelo Astrifero </p>
<p>Coram spiritibus illius telluris repraesentabantur magnifica palatia, ad similitudinem illorum quae in nostra tellure apud reges et principes sunt; 
nam talia coram spiritibus repraesentari possunt, et cum repraesentantur apparent prorsus sicut forent; verum spiritus ex illa tellure nihil illa aestimabant, vocabant illa simulacra marmorea; et tunc 
narrabant quod apud eos magnificentiora sint; sed quod illa essent aedes eorum sacrae, non ex lapide sed ex ligno; et cum illis dicebatur quod illa usque essent terrestria, respondebant quod non essent, 
sed caelestia, quia cum illa inspiciuntur, non ideam terrestrem sed caelestem habent, credentes quod etiam visuri similia in caelo post mortem. </p>
