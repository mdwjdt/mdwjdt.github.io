<h4 align="center"></h4><p><strong>507.</strong>被称为“该南”的教会绝不可和那更为完美的三个教会相提并论，因为这就是前教会如此清晰的直觉开始变得一般的那个点，好比离果核或种子最近的第一层软膜。尽管该状态没有实际描述出来，但可从接下来对名为以诺和挪亚的教会的描述明显看出来。</p>

<p><strong>[NCE]507.</strong> The church called Kenan must not be counted as belonging with the three more perfect ones because in its time the more distinct perception of the earlier churches began to become more general. It was like the first, somewhat soft layers of a fruit or seed next to the pit or germ. Conditions in this church are not described, admittedly, but can be seen from later verses — from the description of the churches named Enoch and Noah, for example [<a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_507/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_519" target=_top>519</a>, <a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_507/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_521" target=_top>521-522</a>, <a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_507/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_530" target=_top>530-531</a>]. </p>

The church called "Kenan" is not to be so much reckoned among those three more perfect ones, inasmuch as perception, which in the former churches had been distinct, began now to become general, comparatively 
as are the first and softer membranes relatively to the kernel of fruits or seeds; which state is not indeed described, but still is apparent from what follows, as from the description of the 
churches called "Enoch" and "Noah." </p>

<p align="center"><b>Elliott(1983-1999) 507</b></p><p><b>507.</b>
The Church called Kenan must not be listed so closely with those three that were more perfect, for this was the point when the perception which had been so definite with those former Churches started 
to become general. Comparatively it was like the first and softer coverings closest to the kernel of a fruit or seed. Although this state is not actually described it is nevertheless apparent from what 
follows, in the description of the Churches named Enoch and Noah.  </p>

</p><b>507.</b>
Ecclesia 'Kenan' dicta non recensenda ita est inter perfectiores illas tres, nam incepit tunc perceptio quae apud priores distincta fuit, communis fieri; et comparative sicut primae et molliores membranae 
se habent ad nucleum fructus seu seminis; qui status quidem non describitur sed usque conspicitur a sequentibus, ut a descriptione Ecclesiarum quae 'Hanoch' et quae 'Noah' appellatae. </p>
