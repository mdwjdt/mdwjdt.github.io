<h4 align="center"></h4><p><strong>54.</strong>造男造女。<br />上古教会原明了“男”与“女”的内义，但后来人因不再明白圣经的内义，该奥秘也就不为人知了。上古之人以婚姻为最大的乐事，若有任何事物可与比较，他们就拿来比较，以便从中揣摩婚姻的乐趣。作为内在之人，他们唯以内在的事物为乐。外在的事物虽在眼前，他们的思维所专注的却是它们的象征。所以，外在的事物对他们来说无关紧要，仅被用来反思内在之性，进而反思属天之性，乃至贯乎他们一切的主。该过程也促使他们反思属天的婚姻，从中看出属天的婚姻是夫妻生活的快乐之源。正因如此，他们将属灵之人的觉性称为“男”，将其意志称为“女”，当两者协作如一，就称之为一个“婚姻”。由此，将渴慕良善的教会称为“女儿”、“童女”（如“锡安的童女”、“耶路撒冷的童女”）、“妻子”也就成了一种习俗。关于这些，更多可见下文（创世记<a href="http://39-27.cn/创2.24.htm">2:24</a>，<a href="http://39-27.cn/创3.15.htm">3:15</a>）。</p>

<p><strong>[NCE]54.</strong> Male and female he created them.<br />The inner meaning of male and female was very familiar to the earliest church, although their successors lost touch with this secret when they lost sight of any deeper import to the Word.<br />These earliest people found their greatest happiness and pleasure in marriage.{*1} Whenever they could possibly draw a comparison between something else and marriage, they did so, in order to perceive the happiness of marriage in that other entity.{*2} Being people of depth, they enjoyed only the deeper aspects of things. External objects were just for looking at; their thoughts were occupied instead with the things those objects represented. External objects, then, were nothing to them, serving only as a springboard for reflection on inner realities, and these for contemplation of heavenly realities and so of the Lord, who was everything to them. The same process caused them to reflect on the heavenly marriage,{*3} which they could tell was the source of the happiness in their own marriages.<br />As a result, they called the intellect in the spiritual being male and the will there female; and when the two worked together, they called it a marriage.<br />That religion initiated the practice, which became quite common, of calling the church Daughter or Virgin{*4} (as in "the Virgin Zion," "the Virgin Jerusalem") and also Wife, on account of its desire for good. For more on this, see the treatment of <a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_54/bible_king-james-version_genesis_2_24" target=_top>Genesis 2:24</a> and <a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_54/bible_king-james-version_genesis_3_15" target=_top>3:15</a>.{*5} <br /><strong>Footnotes:</strong><br />{*1} Swedenborg later wrote a work on marriage — his 1768 work Marriage Love. In it he defines chastity not as celibacy, but as sexual love within a monogamous marriage, because "it comes from the Lord and answers to the marriage of the Lord and the church" (<a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_54/swedenborg_conjugial-love-rogers_143" target=_top>Marriage Love 143</a>; this and all other translations from Marriage Love in these notes are by George F. Dole). The work, in fact, begins with a description of a wedding in heaven (<a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_54/swedenborg_conjugial-love-rogers_19" target=_top>Marriage Love 19-22</a>; compare <a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_54/swedenborg_true-christian-religion-chadwick_746" target=_top>True Christianity 746-749</a>). [RS]<br />{*2} Perhaps an example of a subject susceptible to comparison to marriage would be music. These earliest people, as Swedenborg describes them, might for instance have seen a marriage between the mechanics of a piece — melody, harmony, rhythm, and so on — and the feeling expressed in it. They might then have been pleased, in listening to it, not only by the form and content of the music itself but also by the way form and content combined in reflection of a marriage. [LHC]<br />{*3} By "heavenly marriage" Swedenborg here means the "marriage" between goodness and truth or love and wisdom.

[LHC]<br />{*4} In a time when a woman was identified primarily in terms of her marital status, the term represented here by "virgin" (virgo in Latin; בְּתוּלָה [bǝṯûlā] in Hebrew; παρθένος [parthénos] in Greek) had as much to do with a woman's dependence on her father and eligibility for marriage as with her lack of sexual experience. Where possible, the word has been translated "young woman."

Male and female created He them. What is meant by "male and female" in the internal sense, was well known to the Most Ancient Church, but when the interior sense of the Word was lost among their posterity, 
this arcanum also perished. Their marriages were their chief sources of happiness and delight, and whatever admitted of the comparison they likened to marriage, in order that in this way they might 
perceive its felicity. Being also internal men, they were delighted only with internal things. External things they merely saw with the eyes, but thought of what was represented. So that outward 
things were nothing to them, save as these could in some measure be the means of causing them to turn their thoughts to internal things, and from these to celestial things, and so to the Lord who was 
their all, and consequently to the heavenly marriage, from which they perceived the happiness of their marriages to come. The understanding in the spiritual man they therefore called male, and the will 
female, and when these acted as a one they called it a marriage. From that church came the form of speech which became customary, whereby the church itself, from its affection of good, was called "daughter" 
and "virgin"-as the "virgin of Zion" the "virgin of Jerusalem"-and also "wife." But on these subjects see the following chapter, at verse 23, and chapter 3, verse 15. </p>

Male and female He created them. What 'male and female' is used to mean in the internal sense was very well known in the Most Ancient Church, but when among later generations the interior sense of the 
Word was lost, so too was this particular arcanum. Marriages gave them their highest forms of happiness and delight; and they used to liken to a marriage anything that could be likened to it, in order 
that from it they might feel the happiness of marriage. And because they were internal men they took delight solely in internal things. As to external things, they did no more with them than take them 
in with their eyes, but their thoughts involved what those things represented - so much so that external things meant nothing to them except insofar as they could reflect internal things in them, 
and in those internal things reflect celestial things, and in so doing reflect the Lord, who was to them everything. Consequently they reflected the heavenly marriage in those things, which, they perceived, 
was the source of the happiness in their own marriages. For this reason they called the understanding in the spiritual man Male and the will Female, and when the two acted as one, they called it 
Marriage. From that Church sprang the common usage of referring to the Church itself, because of its affection for good, as 'a daughter', and also 'a virgin' - as in Virgin of Zion, Virgin of Jerusalem 
- and 'a wife' as well. On these matters however see verse 23 of the next chapter, and Chapter 3:15.  </p>

Masculum et feminam creavit illos. Quid per masculum et feminam in sensu interno intelligatur, Antiquissimae Ecclesiae notissimum fuit, at vero apud posteros, quando sensus interior Verbi, etiam hoc 
arcanum periit: summae illorum felicitates et deliciae erant conjugia, et quicquid usquam assimilari potuit conjugiis, assimilabant ut inde perciperent felicitatem conjugii; et quia interni homines erant, 
delectabantur solum internis, externa solum spectabant oculis, sed cogitabant de illis quae repraesentabant, sic ut externa illis nihil essent, modo ut aliquid possent ab iis reflectere ad interna, 
et ab internis ad caelestia, et sic ad Dominum, Qui iis erat omne; proinde ad conjugium caeleste, a quo felicitas eorum conjugiorum venire percipiebant: ideo in homine spirituali intellectum vocabant 
masculum, et voluntatem feminam, quae cum unum agerent, dicebant conjugium: ab Ecclesia illa emanavit formula quae sollemnis facta, quod Ipsa Ecclesia ab affectione boni vocata sit 'filia,' tum 'virgo,' 
ut 'virgo Zion, virgo Hierosolyma,' ut et 'uxor.' Sed de his vide cap. seq. ad vers. 23, et ad cap. iii 15. </p>
