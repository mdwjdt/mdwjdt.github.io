<h3 align="center" class="ired">属天的奥秘 第4186节</h3>
<h4 align="center"></h4><p><strong>4186.</strong>“凡你所看见的都是我的”表一切觉察和理解的能力。这从“看见”的含义清楚可知，“看见”是指觉察并理解（参看<a href="2150.htm">2150</a>，<a href="3863.htm">3863</a>节），因而是指它的觉察和理解真理与良善的一切能力。这一切的含义早已讨论过，并通过来世所发生的事加以说明，即：当灵人，尤其中间或居间类型的灵人处于某个天使社群时，他们只知道从该社群所流入的对良善与真理的情感是他们自己的，因为这就是来世情感与思维交流的性质；他们越是与该社群联结，就越以为这些情感是他们的。当这些灵人与该社群分离时，他们就会非常恼火；当进入愤慨的状态时，他们也会进入上述模糊的状态（<a href="4184.htm">4184</a>节）。在这种状态下，因没有内在的觉察，他们就为自己索要属于天使社群，并且他们曾通过上述交流所拥有的良善与真理。本节描述的，正是这种状态。<br />此外，我通过大量经历得知对良善与真理的情感如何传给其他人。这类灵人有时与我同在，当通过些许情感与我联结时，他们只知道我的思维和情感是他们的。我得知，这种事同样发生在所有世人身上，因为每个人都有灵人与他同在，这些灵人一临到他，并进入他的情感，就只知道此人所拥有的一切，也就是其情感和思维的一切，都是他们的。灵人就是以这种方式与人联结的，主通过他们掌管人（<a href="2488.htm">2488</a>节）。关于这些事，有必要通过后面各章末尾的经历来加以阐述。</p>

And all that thou seest is mine. That this signifies that so was all the perceptive and intellectual faculty, is evident from the signification of "seeing," as being to perceive and understand (see n. 
2150, 3863), thus that all the perceptive and intellectual faculty of truth and good belonged to it. How the case herein is has already been stated, and has been illustrated by what takes place in the 
other life, namely, that when spirits, especially those of a mediate kind, are in an angelic society, they do not then know otherwise than that the affections of good and truth which flow into them 
from the society are theirs, such being the communication of affections and thoughts in the other life; and in proportion as they are conjoined with that society, so do they think. When these same spirits 
are separated from the society, they are indignant; and when they come into this state of indignation, they also come into an obscure state (spoken of above, n. 4184); and in this state having no 
interior perception, they claim for themselves the goods and truths which belong to the angelic society, and which they had by the communication above mentioned. It is this state which is described 
in this verse. Moreover by much experience it has been given me to know how the affections of good and truth are communicated to others. Spirits of this kind have sometimes been with me, and when conjoined 
by somewhat of affection, they knew no otherwise than that my thoughts and affections were theirs. And I was informed that the like takes place with all men; for every man has spirits with him, 
who as soon as they come to him and enter into his affections, know no otherwise than that all things which are the man's (that is, all things of his affection and thought) are theirs. In this way spirits 
are conjoined with a man, and through them he is ruled by the Lord (n. 2488); concerning which facts something shall be stated from experience hereafter, at the end of the chapters. </p>

'And all that you see is mine' means all ability to perceive and to understand. This is clear from the meaning of 'seeing' as perceiving and understanding, dealt with in <a href="2150.htm">2150</a>, <a href="3863.htm">3863</a>, and so as all its 
ability to perceive and understand truth and good. The implications of all this have been discussed already and have been illustrated by the things that happen in the next life - in the description of 
what happens when spirits of the intermediate kind in particular are in some angelic community. At such times those spirits are not aware that the affections for good and truth flowing in from that 
community are anything other than their own. For that is what the communication of affections and thoughts is like in the next life; and in the measure that the spirits have become linked to that community 
they imagine those affections to be their own. When those same spirits are separated from that community they are extremely annoyed, and as they enter a state of annoyance they also enter the obscure 
state referred to above in <a href="4184.htm">4184</a>. Having no interior perception in that state they claim as their own the goods and truths which belong to that angelic community and which they too have possessed 
through the communication described above. It is this state that is described in the present verse. </p>
<p></p>
<p><b>[2]</b>
 Furthermore, I have been given to know through much experience about the way in which affections 
for good and truth are communicated to others. Spirits of that kind have sometimes been with me, and when they have become linked to me through any degree of affection they have not been aware of 
the things that were mine as being anything other than their own. And I have been told that the same happens to all people, for everyone has spirits with him, who, the moment they come to him and enter 
his affection, are not conscious of anything at all which that person possesses - that is to say, any facet of his affection or thought - as being anything other than their own. This is the way in 
which spirits are linked to man, and through them the Lord governs him, <a href="2488.htm">2488</a>. A discussion of these matters from actual experience will appear below at the ends of chapters. </p>

`Et omne quod tu videns, mihi hoc': quod significet omne perceptivum et intellectuale, constat a significatione `videre' quod sit percipere et intelligere, de qua n. 2150, 3863, ita quod omne perceptivum 
et intellectuale veri et boni ejus esset.  Haec quomodo se habent, prius dictum est, et illustratum per illa quae in altera vita fiunt, quod nempe spiritus cumprimis mediae sortis, cum sunt 
in societate quadam angelica, tunc non aliter sciant quam quod affectiones boni et veri quae a societate influunt, sint illorum; talis enim est communicatio affectionum et cogitationum in altera 
vita, et quantum cum illa societate conjuncti sunt, `quod' tantum id putent; iidem cum separantur inde, indignantur, et cum in statum indignationis, etiam in statum obscurum veniunt, de quo {1} supra 
n. 4184, in quo statu quia non perceptionem interiorem habent, vindicant sibi bona et vera quae societatis angelicae sunt et per communicationem, de qua dictum, habuerunt; [2] hic status est qui 
in hoc versu describitur; praeterea per multam experientiam mihi scire datum (o)est, quomodo affectiones boni et veri communicantur aliis; spiritus illius sortis aliquoties apud me fuerunt, et cum 
per affectionis quid conjuncti essent, tunc non aliter sciverunt quam quod mea illorum essent; et informatus quod simile fiat apud omnes homines; quilibet enim homo apud se habet spiritus, qui ut 
primum veniunt ad hominem ac intrant in ejus affectionem, non aliter norunt {2} quam quod omnia quae hominis sunt, nempe omnia affectionis et cogitationis ejus, sint illorum; </p>
