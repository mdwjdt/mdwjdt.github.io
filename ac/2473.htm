<h3 align="center" class="ired">属天的奥秘 第2473节</h3>
<h4 align="center"></h4><p><strong>2473.</strong>内部记忆无限优于外部记忆，就像数个无数之于一，或光之于暗。因为内部记忆的无数观念会流入外部记忆的一个事物中，在那里呈现为一个总的、模糊的事物。因此，灵人的所有本能，尤其天使的，即他们的感觉，他们的思维和直觉，都处于更完美的状态。从下面的例子可以看出内部记忆如何优于外部记忆。当一个人想起他因多年交往而十分了解其品性的某个人时，无论这人是友是敌，他对此人的想法就呈现为一个模糊的形像，这是因为他正通过外部记忆进行思考。但当这个人成为灵人，并想起那个人时，他对那人的想法，甚至对那人曾怀有的一切看法，都会呈现出来，这是因为那时他正通过内部记忆进行思考。一切其它事都是如此：人所详细了解的事情本身会在外部记忆中呈现为一个总的整体；但在内部记忆中，他对这个事所曾获得的某个观念的一切细节都会呈现出来，并且这些细节会以奇妙的方式显现。</p>

<p align="center"><b>Potts(1905-1910) 2473</b></p><p><b>2473.</b>
The interior memory immeasurably surpasses the exterior, and is relatively as are some myriads to one, or as light is to darkness; for myriads of the ideas of the interior memory flow into a single thing 
of the exterior memory, and there present a general obscure something. Hence all the faculties of spirits, and still more those of angels, are in a more perfect state, that is, both their sensations, 
and their thoughts and perceptions. In what way the interior memory excels the exterior, may be seen from examples. When a man calls to remembrance any other man whose quality is known to him from 
the interaction of many years, whether a friend or an enemy, that which he then thinks about him is presented as one obscure thing; and this because he is thinking from the exterior memory. But when 
the same man has become a spirit, and calls the other to remembrance, that which he then thinks about him is presented as to all the ideas which he had ever conceived concerning him; and this because 
he is then thinking from the interior memory. And so it is with everything: the thing itself about which anyone has known many things presents itself in the exterior memory as a single general thing; 
but in the interior memory it presents itself as to all the particulars about which he has ever acquired for himself an idea in respect to that thing; and this in a wonderful form. </p>

<p align="center"><b>Elliott(1983-1999) 2473</b></p><p><b>2473.</b>
The interior memory is immensely superior to the exterior, as several myriads are to one, or as light is to darkness; for myriads of ideas belonging to the interior memory flow into just one belonging 
to the exterior memory where they manifest something general and obscure. Consequently all the capabilities which spirits possess, more so which angels possess, are present with them to a more perfect 
degree, that is to say, both their feelings and also their thoughts and perceptions. Just how superior the character of the interior memory is to the exterior may become clear from examples: When any 
individual calls somebody else to mind, friend or foe, whose character he has come to know from associating with him over the years, his thought of that person presents itself as one obscure image, 
the reason being that this is formed from the exterior memory. But when the same individual has become a spirit and calls that person to mind his thought of him presents itself as to all the ideas he 
has ever gained concerning him, the reason being that this image is formed from the interior memory. So it is with everything else; the thing itself about which someone knows much presents itself in 
the exterior memory as one general whole, but in the interior memory as to the individual details of which he has ever gained some idea concerning that thing, and these present themselves in wonderful array. </p>

<p align="center"><b>Latin(1748-1756) 2473</b>
</p><b>2473.</b>
Memoria interior prae exteriore immensum excellit, et se habet sicut aliquot myriades ad unum, aut sicut lucidum ad tenebrosum; myriades enim idearum memoriae interioris influunt in unum memoriae exterioris, 
(c)et ibi sistunt aliquod commune obscurum; inde omnes facultates spirituum, et magis angelorum, in perfectiore statu sunt, nempe tam eorum sensationes quam cogitationes et perceptiones. Qualis 
excellentia sit memoriae interioris prae exteriore, constare potest ab exemplis; aliquis homo qui quoad ejus quale ex plurium annorum conversatione notus est, amicus vel inimicus, dum homo ejus recordatur, 
sistitur illud quod tunc cogitat de (c)illo, ut unum obscurum, et hoc quia ex memoria exteriore; at cum idem homo factus spiritus, ejus recordatur, sistitur illud quod tunc cogitat de illo, 
quoad omnes ideas qui usquam cepit de illo, et hoc quia ex memoria interiore: similiter se habet cum unaquavis re; ipsa res de qua plura novit, se sistit in memoria exteriore ut unum quoddam commune; 
at in memoria interiore quoad singula, quorum ideam usquam de illa re sibi comparavit, et hoc in forma mirabili. </p>
