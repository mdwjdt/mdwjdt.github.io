<h3 align="center" class="ired">属天的奥秘 第4018节</h3>
<h4 align="center"></h4><p><strong>4018.</strong>“正对着羊群；它们来喝的时候，就发热配合”表甚至直到对真理的情感里面有一种强烈的渴望，即与属世层里面的良善并真理的结合能得以产生。这从“来喝的时候发热”的含义清楚可知，“来喝的时候发热”是指一种强烈渴望。“发热”表示一种强烈渴望，这是显而易见的；“来喝”表示对真理的情感（参看<a href="4017.htm">4017</a>节）。“正对着羊群”之所表示与属世层里面的良善并真理的结合能得以产生，是因为这句话含有看见，以及由此激发情感的意思；事实上，属灵事物就是以这种方式被联结到一个人身上。此外，真理与良善的一切植入，以及一切结合都是通过情感实现的。若人对所学习的真理与良善没有情感，那么它们虽进入记忆，但却像被微风吹到墙头上的羽毛那样附在那里。<br />至于进入记忆的东西，情况乃是这样：凡不带着情感进入的，都掉入记忆的阴影部分；凡带着情感进入的，则进入记忆的光明。每当唤起具有相似性质的主题时，在光明中的事物就能被看见，并且显得清晰、生动；而隐藏在周围、处于阴影部分的事物则不然。这就是爱之情感的效果。由此可见，真理的一切植入以及它与良善的结合都是通过情感实现的；情感越深，这二者就结合得越牢固。情感的强烈渴望在此是指至内在的情感。<br />不过，真理无法被植入在良善中，并与其结合，除非通过对真理与良善的情感，这些情感是从作为其源头的对邻之仁和对主之爱中涌出的。但邪恶与虚假却能通过对邪恶与虚假的情感而被植入和结合，而这些情感则是从作为其源头的自我之爱和尘世之爱涌出的。既如此，并且由于此处在内义上所论述的主题是属世人里面良善与真理的结合，故经上在此处和下文提到羊群来喝的时候就发热，这句话就表示这类事。</p>

<p align="center"><b>Potts(1905-1910) 4018</b></p><p><b>4018.</b>
Over against the flocks; and they grew warm when they came to drink. That this signifies even to ardor of affection that they might be conjoined, is evident from the signification of "growing warm in 
coming to drink," as being the ardor of affection. That "growing warm" signifies ardor, is manifest; and that "coming to drink" signifies the affection of truth, may be seen just above (n. 4017). That 
"over against the flocks" signifies that they might be conjoined (namely, the truths and goods in the natural), is because it involves looking upon, and the affection excited thereby, for in this manner 
are spiritual things conjoined. Moreover, all the implantation of truth and good, and also all conjunction, is wrought by means of affection. Truths and goods that are learned, but with which the 
man is not affected, do indeed enter into the memory, but adhere there as lightly as a feather to a wall, which is blown away by the slightest breath of wind. [2] With the things which enter into the 
memory the case is this: Those which enter without affection fall into its shade; but those which enter with affection come into its light; and the things that are in light there are seen and appear 
clearly and vividly whenever a similar subject is called up; but not so those which lie hid round about in the shade. Such is the effect of the affection of love. It may be seen from this that all the 
implantation of truth, and the conjunction thereof with good, is effected by means of affection; and the greater the affection, the stronger the conjunction. The "ardor of affection" is here inmost 
affection. [3] But truths cannot be implanted in good and conjoined with it, except by means of the affections of truth and good, which affections well forth as from their fountains, from charity toward 
the neighbor, and from love to the Lord. But evils and falsities are implanted and conjoined by means of the affections of evil and falsity, which affections well forth as from their fountains, from 
the love of self and of the world. This being the case, and as the subject here treated of in the internal sense is the conjunction of good and truth in the natural man, therefore here and in what 
follows mention is made of the growing warm of the flock when they came to drink, by which such things are signified. </p>

<p align="center"><b>Elliott(1983-1999) 4018</b></p><p><b>4018.</b>
'In front of the flocks; and they came on heat as they came to drink' means even to the point of an intense desire in the affection for truth that a joining [to the goods and truths within the natural] 
might be effected. This is clear from the meaning of 'coming on heat as they came to drink' as an intense desire. The meaning of 'being on treat' as an intense desire is self-evident; and for the meaning 
of 'coming to dunk' as the affection for truth, see immediately above in <a href="4017.htm">4017</a>. The reason why 'in front of the flocks' means that a joining to the truths and goods within the natural might be effected 
is that this phrase implies seeing and consequent arousal of affection, for this is the manner in which spiritual things are joined to a person. What is more, every implantation of truth or good 
in a person, as well as every joining of them to him, is effected by means of affection. The truths and goods which a person has learned but for which he has no affection do indeed enter the memory, 
but they are lodged there as insecurely as a feather on top of a wall which is blown off by the slightest puff of wind. </p>
<p></p>
<p><b>[2]</b>
 As regards the things that enter the memory the position is this: Those 
for which there is no affection pass into the unlit parts of the memory when they enter it, whereas those for which there is affection pass into the light there. Things present in that light are seen 
and appear clearly and distinctly when any matter of a similar nature is brought up, but not so the things lying around in the unlit parts. Such is the effect that affection belonging to love has. From 
this it may be seen that all implanting of truth and joining of it to good is effected through affection; and the greater that affection, the stronger the tie joining the two together. </p>
<p></p>
<p><b>[3]</b>
 The intense 
desire of the affection is in this case inmost affection. But truths are not capable of being implanted and joined to good except by means of affections for truth and good, which affections well 
up from charity towards the neighbour and love to the Lord as their sources. But evils and falsities are implanted by means of affections for evil and falsity, and these affections well up from self-love 
and love of the world as their sources. This being so, and the subject at this point in the internal sense being the joining of good and truth within the natural man, mention is therefore made here 
and in what follows of the flock being on heat when they came to drink, by which such considerations are meant. </p>

</p><b>4018.</b>
`E regione gregum, et incalescebant in veniendo illos ad bibendum': quod significet usque ad affectionis ardorem ut conjungerentur, constat ex significatione `incalescere in veniendo ad bibendum' 
quod sit affectionis ardor; quod `incalescere' sit ardor, {1}patet, et quod `venire ad bibendum' sit affectio veri, videatur mox supra n. 4017; `e regione gregum' quod sit ut conjungerentur, nempe 
vera et bona naturali, {2}est quia involvit intuitionem et inde excitatam affectionem, spiritualia enim ita conjunguntur; et praeterea omnis implantatio veri et boni, tum omnis conjunctio, fit per 
affectionem; vera et bona quae discuntur quibus homo non afficitur, in memoriam quidem intrant, sed tam leviter ibi haerent, sicut pluma parieti, quae dissipatur levissimo aspirante vento; [2] cum 
rebus quae in memoriam {3}intrant, ita se habet: quae absque affectione intrant, cadunt in umbram ejus, at quae cum affectione, veniunt in lucem ibi; quae ibi in luce sunt, videntur et apparent clare 
et vive ad similis rei excitationem quamcumque, non autem ita quae circum latent in umbra; affectio quae est amoris hoc secum habet; inde constare potest quod omnis implantatio veri, et ejus conjunctio 
cum bono fiat per affectionem, et quo major affectio, eo fortior conjunctio; [3] affectionis ardor est hic intima affectio; sed vera implantari et bono conjungi nequeunt, nisi per affectiones 
veri et boni, quae affectiones scaturiunt ut ex suis fontibus a charitate erga proximum, et ab amore in Dominum; at mala et falsa per affectiones mali et falsi, quae affectiones scaturiunt ut ex 
suis fontibus  (c)ab amore sui et mundi; quia res ita se habet, et hic de conjunctione (t)boni et veri in naturali homine in sensu interno agitur, ideo hic et in sequentibus memoratur de `incalescentia 
gregis cum venirent ad bibendum,' per quae talia significantur. @1 constat$ @2 inde constare potest quod involvat$ @3 i hominis$ </p>
