<h3 align="center" class="ired">属天的奥秘 第277节</h3>
<h4 align="center"></h4><p><strong>277.</strong>这是圣经的内义。拘于文字者，将之理解为人必须辛苦劳作，才能从土里得吃的。然而，“男人”在此并非指某个人，而是指上古教会，“土”也不是指土，“粮”也不是指粮，“园”也不是指园，而是指属天、属灵之物，这在前面已作了充分的说明。</p>

<p><strong>[NCE]277.</strong> This is the inner meaning. No one who stresses the literal sense gains any more from it than the fact that humanity would wrest their food from the ground by hard work, or the sweat of their brow. The human being here, though, means not an individual but the earliest church. The ground does not mean ground, the bread bread, or the garden a garden, but things that are heavenly or spiritual, as has been sufficiently illustrated already. </p>
<p align="center"><b>Potts(1905-1910) 277</b></p><p><b>277.</b>
This is the internal sense. He who keeps close to the letter, understands no other than that man must procure bread for himself out of the ground by labor, or by the sweat of his face. "Man" however 
does not here mean anyone man, but the Most Ancient Church; nor does "ground" mean ground, nor "bread" bread, nor "garden" garden, but celestial and spiritual things, as has been sufficiently shown. </p>

<p align="center"><b>Elliott(1983-1999) 277</b></p><p><b>277.</b>
This is the internal sense. Anyone who keeps rigidly to the letter apprehends no more than this, that man was to obtain bread from the ground by means of hard work, that is, with sweat on his brow. 'Man' 
here however is not used to mean one individual but the Most Ancient Church. Neither is 'the ground' used to mean the ground, nor 'bread' bread, nor 'garden' garden, but things which are celestial 
and spiritual, as has been shown quite adequately.  </p>

</p><b>277.</b>
Hic est sensus internus: qui litteram premit, is non aliud capit quam quod homo ex humo compararet sibi panem per laborem seu sudorem vultus; sed hic per 'hominem' non intelligitur unus homo sed Antiquissima 
Ecclesia, nec per 'humum' humus, nec per 'panem' panis, nec per 'hortum' hortus, sed quae sunt caelestia et spiritualia, sicut satis ostensum est. </p>
