<h4 align="center"></h4><p><strong>7516.</strong>出埃及记9:8-12.耶和华对摩西、亚伦说，你们满满捧出炉灰，让摩西在法老眼前向天撒去。这炉灰要在埃及全地变作尘土，在埃及全地，在人身上和牲畜身上，成了起脓疱的疮。他们取了炉灰，站在法老面前。摩西向天撒去，就在人身上和牲畜身上，成了起脓疱的疮。术士因这疮在摩西面前站立不住；因为术士和一切埃及人身上都有这疮。耶和华使法老的心坚硬，不听他们，正如耶和华对摩西所说的。<br />“耶和华对摩西、亚伦说”表新的指示。“你们满满捧出”表在能被接受的程度内所赋予的能力。“炉灰”表通过与那些进行侵扰的人同在而激起恶欲的虚假。“让摩西向天撒去”表这些虚假将被展示给天堂居民。“在法老眼前”表当着他的面。“这炉灰要在埃及全地变作尘土”表这些虚假在属世心智中的诅咒。“在人身上和牲畜身上”表内层和外层邪恶的产物。“成了起脓疱的疮”表所导致的污秽和亵渎。“在埃及全地”表在整个属世心智。“他们取了炉灰”表恶欲的虚假。“站在法老面前”表当着那些进行侵扰之人的面。“摩西向天撒去”表这些虚假被展示给天堂居民。“就成了起脓疱的疮”表由内层和外层邪恶所导致的污秽和亵渎。“术士因这疮在摩西面前站立不住”表那些通过产生外表上类似真实事物的某种事物而滥用神性秩序的人无法继续同在。“因为术士都有这疮”表类似污秽从他们身上涌出。“和一切埃及人身上”表如同出现那些进行侵扰的人身上一样。“耶和华使法老的心坚硬”表他们仍旧固执。“不听他们”表他们不服从。“正如耶和华对摩西所说的”表正如所预言的。</p>

Verses 8-12. And Jehovah said unto Moses and unto Aaron, Take to you in the fullness of your fists ashes of the furnace, and let Moses sprinkle it toward heaven unto the eyes of Pharaoh. And it shall 
be dust over all the land of Egypt, and it shall be upon man and upon beast a sore breaking forth in pustules in all the land of Egypt. And they took ashes of the furnace, and stood before Pharaoh; and 
Moses sprinkled it toward heaven, and it became a sore of pustules breaking forth on man and on beast. And the magicians could not stand before Moses because of the sore; for the sore was on the magicians 
and on all the Egyptians. And Jehovah made firm the heart of Pharaoh, and he heard them not, as Jehovah had spoken unto Moses. "And Jehovah said unto Moses and unto Aaron," signifies instruction 
anew; "take to you in the fullness of your fists," signifies power given, as much as could be received; "ashes of the furnace," signifies of exciting the falsities of cupidities through presence with 
those who infest; "and let Moses sprinkle it toward heaven," signifies these falsities shown to those who are in heaven; "unto the eyes of Pharaoh," signifies in the presence; "and it shall be dust 
over all the land of Egypt," signifies the damnation of these falsities in the natural mind; "and it shall be upon man and upon beast," signifies which are from evil interior and exterior; "a sore breaking 
forth in pustules," signifies filthy things together with the consequent blasphemies; "in all the land of Egypt," signifies in the whole natural mind; "and they took ashes of the furnace," signifies 
falsities of cupidities; "and stood before Pharaoh," signifies in the presence of those who infest; "and Moses sprinkled it toward heaven," signifies these things shown to those who are in heaven; 
"and it became a sore of pustules breaking forth on man and on beast," signifies filthy things together with blasphemies from evil interior and exterior; "and the magicians could not stand before Moses 
because of the sore," signifies that those could not be present who abused Divine order by portraying the like in the outward form; "for the sore was on the magicians," signifies that the like filthy 
things came forth from them; "and on all the Egyptians," signifies as were in those who were infesting; "and Jehovah made firm the heart of Pharaoh," signifies that they were determined; "and he 
heard them not," signifies that they did not obey; "as Jehovah had spoken unto Moses," signifies according to the prediction. </p>

<p>'And Jehovah said to 
Moses and to Aaron' means fresh instruction. 'Take for yourselves in fistfuls' means power, imparted in the measure that it could be received. 'The ashes of the furnace' means to arouse the falsities 
that are a product of evil desires, by being present with those engaged in molestation. 'And let Moses scatter them in the direction of heaven' means that those falsities were to be demonstrated to the 
inhabitants of heaven. 'Before Pharaoh's eyes' means in his presence. 'And there will then be dust over all the land of Egypt' means the damnation of those falsities in the natural mind. 'And there 
will be on man and on beast' means products of interior and exterior evil. 'Sores breaking out into pustules' means resulting filthiness together with blasphemy. 'In all the land of Egypt' means in the 
whole natural mind. 'And they took the ashes of the furnace' means the falsities that are a product of evil desires. 'And stood before Pharaoh' means in the presence of those engaged in molestation. 
'And Moses scattered them in the direction of heaven' means those falsities, demonstrated to the inhabitants of heaven. 'And sores producing pustules developed, breaking out on man and on beast' means 
filthiness together with blasphemy, that is a product of interior and exterior evil. 'And the magicians could not stand before Moses on account of the sores' means that they could not remain present 
- those who misused Divine order by producing something similar to the real thing in outward appearance. 'For there were sores on the magicians' means that similar filthiness came forth from them. 'And 
on all the Egyptians' means as appeared in those who were engaged in molestation. 'And Jehovah made Pharaoh's heart unyielding' means that they remained obstinate. 'And he did not hear them' means 
that they did not obey. 'As Jehovah had spoken to Moses' means as accorded with what had been foretold.

Vers. 8-12.  Et dixit Jehovah ad Moschen et ad Aharonem, Accipite vobis plenitudine pugnorum vestrorum favillam fornacis, et spargat illam Moscheh versus caelum ad oculos Pharaonis.  Et erit in pulverem 
super omni terra Aegypti, et erit super homine et super bestia ad ulcus efflorescens pustulis in omni terra Aegypti.  Et acceperunt favillam fornacis, et constiterunt coram Pharaone, et sparsit illam 
Moscheh versus caelum, et factum ulcus pustularum efflorescens in homine et in bestia.  Et non potuerunt magi stare coram Moscheh propter ulcus, quia fuit ulcus in magis et in omnibus Aegyptiis. 
 Et obfirmavit Jehovah cor Pharaonis, et non audivit ad illos, quemadmodum locutus Jehovah ad Moschen.  `Et dixit Jehovah ad Moschen et ad Aharonem' significat e novo instructionem: `Accipite vobis plenitudine 
pugnorum vestrorum' significat potentiam, quantum recipi posset, datam: `favillam fornacis' significat excitandi falsa cupiditatum per praesentiam apud illos qui infestant: `et spargat illam 
Moscheh versus caelum' significat falsa ista illis in caelo ostensa: `ad oculos Pharaonis' significat in praesentia: {1} `et erit in pulverem super omni terra Aegypti' significat damnationem falsorum 
illorum in mente naturali: `et (x)erit super homine et super bestia' significat quae ex malo interiore et exteriore: `ad ulcus efflorescens pustulis' significat spurca cum blasphemiis inde: `in omni 
terra Aegypti' significat in tota mente naturali: `et acceperunt favillam fornacis' significat falsa cupiditatum: `et constiterunt coram Pharaone' significat in praesentia illorum qui infestant: `et sparsit 
illam Moscheh versus caelum' significat {2}ista ostensa illis in caelo: `et factum ulcus pustularum efflorescens in homine et in bestia' significat spurca cum blasphemiis ex malo interiore et exteriore: 
`et non potuerunt magi stare coram (x)Moscheh propter ulcus' significat quod non praesentes possent esse (d)qui abusi ordine Divino effigiando simile in forma externa: `quia fuit ulcus in magis' 
significat quod similia spurca ex illis prodirent: `et in omnibus Aegyptiis' significat sicut in illis qui infestabant: `et obfirmavit Jehovah cor Pharaonis' significat quod illi se obstinarent: 
et non audivit ad illos' significat quod non oboedirent: `quemadmodum locutus Jehovah ad Moschen' significat secundum praedictionem. 	@1 See p. 403, footnote 2, which reads: Above super omni S wrote
