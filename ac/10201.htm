<h3 align="center" class="ired">属天的奥秘 第10201节</h3>
<h4 align="center"></h4><p><strong>10201</strong>.“收拾灯的时候，要烧这香”表每当真理也进入自己的光中时。这从“灯”和“烧香”的含义清楚可知：“灯”是指神性真理，因而是指聪明和智慧（参看<a href="9548.htm">9548</a>，<a href="9783.htm">9783</a>节），显然，“收拾”灯或使它们烧得更亮，表示每当它们进入自己的光中时；“烧香”是指垂听并接受敬拜的一切（<a href="10177.htm">10177</a>，<a href="10198.htm">10198</a>节）。由此明显可知，当“收拾灯的时候，每早晨烧这香”表示每当人们进入一个清晰的爱之状态，从而拥有看见真理的聪明和智慧时，首先发生的是垂听并接受敬拜的一切。<br />之所以说他们由此拥有看见真理的聪明和智慧，是因为与人同在的真理之光的性质完全取决于他的爱之状态；有多少爱被点燃，就决定了有多少真理在那里发光。因为爱之良善是在他里面燃烧的生命之火本身，而信之真理则是在他的理解力中发光的光本身，也就是聪明和智慧。爱和真理同行，步调一致。<br />聪明和智慧不是指思考和推理任何主题的能力，因为这种能力同样存在于恶人身上，和存在于善人身上一样。相反，它们是指看见并觉察属于信和仁、伴随对主之爱的真理和良善的能力。这种能力只存在于那些从主获得启示或光照的人身上，他们所获得的启示或光照的量取决于他们所拥有的对主之爱和对邻之仁的量。因为主通过良善，因而通过与人同在的爱和仁进入，并将他引入与那良善一致的真理。但当爱是异类的时，如从主和邻舍转向自我和世界的爱，这些爱就会引领他，不过是把他从真理引向虚假；然而，思考和推理的能力仍然存在。<br />原因在于，这些人不是从主，而是从自己和世界获得启示或光照，这种启示或光照纯粹是属灵事物，也就是与天堂和教会有关的事物上的幽暗。对这些人来说，在天堂之光中观看的内在人被关闭，在世界之光中观看的外在人则被打开。但在没有天堂之光流入的世界之光中看东西，就是在幽暗中去看天堂的事物。事实上，这时，此人通过自我之爱和尘世之爱点燃属世之光到何等程度，他就陷入虚假，由此消灭信之真理到何等程度。这就是为何世上被自我之爱主宰的博学之人因拥有更多机会或资源去证实虚假而比简单人更瞎眼。<br />说这些事是为了叫人们知道，每个人的爱如何，他的信就如何；也叫他们明白当爱进入清晰状态时，真理进入自己的光中是什么意思，这些事上“亚伦每早晨收拾灯的时候，要烧这香”来表示。</p>

In dressing the lamps he shall burn it. That this signifies when truth also comes into its light, is evident from the signification of "lamps," as being Divine truth and the consequent intelligence and 
wisdom (see n. 9548, 9783); that "to dress" or kindle them denotes when these come into their light, is evident; and from the signification of "burning," as being the hearing and reception of all things 
of worship (n. 10177, 10198). From this it is evident that by "burning it every morning, when the lamps were dressed," is signified that the hearing and reception of all things of worship is chiefly 
when they are in a clear state of love, and from this in the intelligence and wisdom of truth.  [2] It is said "from this in the intelligence and wisdom of truth," because the light of truth with 
man is altogether according to the state of his love; in proportion as the love is kindled, the truth shines, for the good of love is the vital fire itself, and the truth of faith is the intellectual 
light itself, which is intelligence and wisdom. These two advance with equal step. [3] By intelligence and wisdom is not meant the capacity to think and reason on every subject, for this exists equally 
with the evil as with the good, but there is meant the capacity to see and perceive the truths and goods which are of faith and charity, and of love to the Lord. This capacity exists solely with 
those who are in enlightenment from the Lord, and they are so far in enlightenment as they are in love to Him and in charity toward the neighbor. For the Lord enters through good, thus through the love 
and charity that are with the man, and leads into truths corresponding to the good; but when the loves are alien, as are those which are turned away from the Lord and the neighbor to self and the world, 
then these loves lead him, but from truths into falsities, while the capacity to think and reason still remains. [4] The reason is that they are not in enlightenment from the Lord, but from self 
and the world, which enlightenment is mere thick darkness in spiritual things, that is, in those which are of heaven and the church. For with such the internal man, which sees from the light of heaven, 
is closed; and the external is opened, which sees from the light of the world; and to see anything from the light of the world without the influx of light from heaven, is to see the things of heaven 
in thick darkness. Nay, insofar as the man has then kindled natural light by means of the loves of self and of the world, so far he rushes into falsities, consequently so far he extinguishes the truths 
of faith. From this it is that the learned of the world, who are in the love of self, having greater resources for confirming falsities, are more blind than the simple.  [5] These things have been 
said that it may be known that the faith of everyone is such as is his love; and that it may be understood what is meant by truth coming into its light when love comes into its clearness, which things 
are signified by "burning the incense every morning when the lamps were dressed." </p>

<p align="center"><b>Elliott(1983-1999) 10201</b></p><p><b>10201.</b>
'When adorning the lamps he shall burn it' means whenever truth as well comes into its own light. This is clear from the meaning of 'the lamps' as Divine Truth, and therefore intelligence and wisdom, 
dealt with in <a href="9548.htm">9548</a>, <a href="9783.htm">9783</a>, 'adorning' them or making them burn more brightly, it is evident, meaning whenever they come into their own light; and from the meaning of 'burning incense' as a hearing and 
receiving of everything of worship, dealt with above in <a href="10177.htm">10177</a>, <a href="10198.htm">10198</a>. From this it is clear that burning incense every single morning when the lamps were 'adorned' means that the hearing and receiving 
of everything of worship takes place first and foremost whenever people enter a clear state of love, and consequently possess intelligence and wisdom with which to see truth.  </p>
<p></p>
<p><b>[2]</b>
 The reason for 
saying that they consequently possess intelligence and wisdom with which to see truth is that the nature of the light of truth present with a person is conditioned altogether by the state of his love; 
how much love is kindled determines how much truth shines there. For the good of love is the actual fire of life burning in him, while the truth of faith is the actual light, that is, intelligence and 
wisdom, shining in his understanding. The love and truth go together, in step with each other.  </p>
<p></p>
<p><b>[3]</b>
 The words 'intelligence and wisdom' are not used to mean the ability to think and reason about 
any matter whatever, for this ability exists with the evil just as much as it does with the good. Instead they are used to mean the ability to see and perceive the truths and forms of good that belong 
to faith and charity, and that go with love to the Lord. This ability exists only with those who receive enlightenment from the Lord; and the amount of enlightenment they receive is determined by the 
amount of love to Him and charity towards the neighbour which they possess. For the Lord comes in through the good, that is, through the love and charity present in the person, and leads him to truths 
in agreement with that good. But if alien loves - which is what loves turned away from the Lord and the neighbour towards self and the world are - reign there, then these loves lead the person. They 
lead away from truths to falsities; yet the ability to think and reason still remains.  </p>
<p></p>
<p><b>[4]</b>
 The reason for all this is that these people do not receive enlightenment from the Lord, only from self 
and the world, and such enlightenment consists of thick and total darkness in spiritual matters, that is, in things which have to do with heaven and the Church. With those people the internal man seeing 
things in the light of heaven is closed and the external man seeing them in the light of the world is open. But seeing something in the light of the world without the light from heaven flowing in means 
that things belonging to heaven are seen in thick darkness. Indeed to the extent that the person has at this time through self-love and love of the world fostered inferior natural light, he plunges 
into falsities and consequently annihilates the truths of faith. This is why the learned people of the world who are ruled by self-love, having a greater opportunity to substantiate falsities, are 
blinder than simple people.  </p>
<p></p>
<p><b>[5]</b>
 These things have been stated in order that people may know that as is anyone's love, so is his faith, and in order that they may understand how it is that truth comes 
into its own light when love comes into clearness, meant by burning incense every single morning when the lamps were 'adorned'.  </p>

`In adornando lucernas suffiet illud': quod significet cum verum etiam venit in suam lucem, constat ex significatione `lucernarum' quod sint Divinum Verum, et inde intelligentia et sapientia de qua 
n. 9548, 9783; quod `adornare' seu accendere illas sit cum illa in suam lucem veniunt, patet; et ex significatione `suffire' quod sit auditio et receptio omnium cultus, de qua supra n. 10,177, (x)10,198; 
inde constat quod per singulis matutinis, cum adornarentur lucernae, suffiretur, significetur quod auditio et receptio omnium cultus praecipue sit, cum in statu amoris claro sunt, et inde in intelligentia 
et sapientia veri. 	[2] Dicitur inde in intelligentia et sapientia veri, quoniam lux veri apud hominem prorsus se habet secundum statum amoris ejus, quantum accenditur amor, tantum lucet verum, 
nam bonum amoris est ipse ignis vitalis, et verum fidei est ipsa lux intellectualis, quae est intelligentia et sapientia; procedunt {1}illa bina pari gradu {2}. 	[3] Per intelligentiam et sapientiam 
non intelligitur facultas cogitandi et ratiocinandi de quacumque re, nam haec datur aeque apud malos quam apud bonos, sed intelligitur facultas videndi et percipiendi vera et bona quae fidei et charitatis, 
et quae amoris in Dominum; haec facultas non datur nisi quam apud illos qui in illustratione sunt a Domino, (c)et tantum in illustratione sunt quantum in amore in Ipsum et in charitate erga 
proximum; intrat enim Dominus per bonum, ita per amorem et charitatem quae apud hominem, et ducit in vera bono correspondentia; at cum alieni amores {3}, ut qui versi a Domino et proximo ad semet et mundum, 
tunc ducunt illi amores eum, sed a veris in falsa, manente usque facultate cogitandi et ratiocinandi; causa est 4 quia non in illustratione sunt a Domino, sed a semet et mundo, quae illustratio 
est mera caligo in spiritualibus, hoc est, in illis quae sunt caeli et Ecclesiae; clausus enim apud illos est internus homo, qui videt (c)a luce caeli, et apertus est externus, qui videt ex luce mundi; 
{4}atque videre aliquid ex luce mundi absque influxu lucis e caelo, est videre in caligine illa quae caeli sunt; immo quantum tunc accenderat homo per amores sui et mundi lumen naturale, tantum ruit 
in falsa, {5} consequenter tantum exstinguit vera fidei; inde est quod eruditi mundi qui in amore sui sunt, quibus major copia confirmandi falsa {6} est, plus caecutiant quam simplices. Haec dicta sunt 
ut sciatur quod fides cujusvis sit sicut (t)ejus amor, utque intelligatur quid sit quod verum veniat in suam lucem, cum amor in suum clarum, quae significantur per quod suffiretur singulis mane, cum 
adornabantur lucernae. @1 haec$ @2 i; intelligentia et sapientia apud hominem se habent secundum quale amoris$ @3 i sunt$ @4 et$ @5 i nam tantum ei copia est confirmandi illa,$ @6 i per scientias$ </p>
