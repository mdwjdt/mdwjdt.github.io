<h3 align="center" class="ired">属天的奥秘 第3085节</h3>
<h4 align="center"></h4><p><strong>3085.</strong>这两节经文描述了对真理的情感：它的起源、性质和引入的初始阶段。它的起源以“利百加出来了。利百加是彼土利所生的，彼土利是亚伯拉罕兄弟拿鹤妻子密迦的儿子”这些话来描述。这些话在内义上阐述了该情感的整个起源（参看<a href="3077.htm">3077</a>，<a href="3078.htm">3078</a>节）。它的性质由“利百加肩头上扛着水瓶；那少女容貌极其俊美”这些话来描述（参看<a href="3079.htm">3079</a>-<a href="3081.htm">3081</a>节）。它引入的初始阶段由“她下到那泉，灌满了瓶，又上来”这些话来描述（参看<a href="3082.htm">3082</a>-<a href="3084.htm">3084</a>节）。<br />不过，这些事不仅超出一般人的理解，也超出聪明人的理解。也就是说，这就是包含在本章和接下来的某些章节内义中的那些事的性质。其原因在于，以下概念几乎难以进入任何人的头脑：神性通过内在人不断流入外在人；也就是说，属天和属灵之物通过理性人流入属世人，或也可说，流入外在人中的属世之物；真理凭该流注不断从属世人中被召唤出来，被植入存在于理性人里面的良善中。人若不知道这些事的发生，又怎么可能知道整个过程是如何发生的呢？这一过程因来自神性，故所包含的智慧如何之大，以致连它的万分之一也无法探究出来。人们只能看到它最一般的方面。<br />既如此，那么，此处包含在内义中的这些事无法描述清楚，并且所描述的事超出人的理解，也就没什么奇怪的了，因为它们论述并描述了这个过程。此外，内义主要为了天使而存在，旨在天堂与世人藉着圣言建立联系。对天使而言，这些事就是诸如给予他们最大快乐的那类事，因为天上的食物无非是构成聪明智慧的一切事物。凡论述主的事对天使来说，都是智慧聪明的祝福。</p>

In these two verses is described the affection of truth as to origin, as to quality, and as to the first of initiation; as to origin, by the words, "Rebekah came out, who was born to Bethuel the son 
of Milcah, the wife of Nahor, Abraham's brother," by which in the internal sense is set forth all the origin of this affection (as may be seen, n. 3077, 3078); as to quality, by the words, "her pitcher 
was upon her shoulder; and the damsel was exceeding good to look upon," by which is described the quality (see n. 3079-3081); as to the first of initiation, by the words, "she went down to the fountain, 
and filled her pitcher, and came up" (as may be seen, n. 3082-3084). [2] But as before said, these things are not only beyond ordinary apprehension, but are also beyond that of more cultivated men-that 
is to say, such things as are contained in the internal sense in this chapter and in some that follow. The reason of this is that it scarcely enters the mind of anyone that there is a continual 
Divine influx through the internal man into the external; that is, an influx of celestial and spiritual things through the rational man into the natural, or what is the same, into the natural things 
of the external man; and that by this influx truths are continually called forth from the natural man, are elevated, and are implanted in the good which is in the rational. As it is not known that this 
takes place, how should all the process be known, and in what manner it is effected; a process of wisdom so great (because from the Divine) that it can never be explored as to a ten-thousandth part; 
the things that can be seen being only the most general? [3] And as such is the case, let no one wonder that the things here contained in the internal sense cannot be described to the apprehension, 
and that what are described transcend the apprehension; for they treat of this process and describe it. And besides, the internal sense is principally for the angels; and this in order that through the 
Word there may be communication between heaven and man; and by the angels such things as are referred to above are accounted as things most delightful, because heavenly food is nothing else than all 
that which is of intelligence and wisdom; and to them the blessedness of wisdom and intelligence is whatever treats of the Lord. </p>

These two verses describe the affection for truth - its origin, its nature, and the initial stage of its introduction. Its origin is described by the words 'Rebekah came out, who was born to Bethuel, 
the son of Milkah, the wife of Nahor, Abraham's brother'. These words convey in the internal sense the whole origin of that affection, see <a href="3077.htm">3077</a>, <a href="3078.htm">3078</a>. Its nature is described by the words 'her pitcher 
was on her shoulder', and 'the girl was very good looking'. These words describe its nature, see <a href="3079.htm">3079</a>-<a href="3081.htm">3081</a>. The initial stage of its introduction is described by the words 'she went down to the spring, 
and filled her pitcher, and went up', as may be seen in <a href="3082.htm">3082</a>-<a href="3084.htm">3084</a>. But these considerations, as stated above, are beyond the grasp not only of any ordinary human intellect but also of one that is 
more advanced. For such is the nature of the things contained in the internal sense in this chapter and in some of those that follow. </p>
<p></p>

 The reason for this is that the idea can hardly enter anyone's 
head that there is a constant Divine influx by way of the internal man into the external man - that is, the idea that celestial and spiritual things flow by way of the rational man into the natural 
man, or what amounts to the same, into the natural things belonging to the external. Also, the idea that by means of that influx truths are constantly being summoned out of the natural man, raised up, 
and implanted in the good that is present in the rational can hardly enter in. And if not even these things are known to take place, what possibility is there of anyone knowing how the whole process 
takes place, a process involving wisdom so great, as it is from the Divine, that not the tiniest fraction can ever be explored? Only its most general aspects can be seen. </p>
<p></p>
<p><b>[3]</b>
 This therefore being 
so, let no one be surprised that the things present here in the internal sense cannot be described intelligibly, and the things which are described are beyond human comprehension, for they have reference 
to and describe that process. Furthermore the internal sense exists chiefly for angels, to the end that by means of the Word communication may exist between heaven and man; and to the angels these 
things are among such as give them great delight, because food in heaven consists of everything that constitutes intelligence and wisdom. And to them the blessedness of wisdom and intelligence consists 
in whatever has the Lord as its subject. </p>

In binis his versibus describitur affectio veri quoad originem, quoad quale, et quoad primum initiationis: quoad originem, per haec quod `Rebecca exiverit, quae nata Bethueli filio Milkae uxoris Nahoris 
fratris Abrahami,' per quae quod omnis origo illius affectionis in sensu interno tradita sit, videatur n. 3077, 3078; quoad quale, per haec quod `cadus ejus super humero ejus,' et quod `puella bona 
aspectu valde,' per quae quod quale descriptum sit, videatur n. 3079-3081; quoad primum initiationis, per haec quod `descendit ad fontem, et implevit cadum suum, et ascendit,' videri potest n. 3082-3084: 
sed ita se habet cum his, sicut supra dictum, quod captum non modo vulgarem, sed etiam excultiorem humanum excedant; [2] quae enim in sensu interno in hoc capite, et in quibusdam sequentibus, continentur, 
talia sunt; causa est quia vix in alicujus mentem venit, quod continuus influxus {1}Divinus sit per internum hominem in externum, hoc est, influxus caelestium et spiritualium per rationalem 
in naturalem, seu quod idem, in naturalia quae sunt externi, et quod per influxum illum {2}continue vera e naturali homine evocentur, eleventur, ac implantentur bono quod in rationali; hoc ne quidem 
quod fiat notum est, quid tunc omnis ille processus quomodo fit, qui processus tantae sapientiae est quia ex Divino, ut nusquam ad unam myriadis partem queat explorari; communissima sunt quae videri 
possunt; [3] cum itaque sic se habet, ne miretur quisquam quod illa quae hic in sensu interno sunt, non ad captum describi queant, et quae describuntur illum transcendant, agant enim de hoc processu et 
illum describunt; et quoque sensus internus imprimis est pro angelis, ob causam, ut per Verbum communicatio sit inter caelum et hominem; [illis haec dantur videre] et sunt illis inter deliciosa, quia 
caelestis cibus non aliud est quam omne id quod est intelligentiae et sapientiae, ac illis est beatum sapientiae et intelligentiae quicquid agit de Domino. @1 a Divino$ @2 continuo AI$ </p>
