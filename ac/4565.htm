<h3 align="center" class="ired">属天的奥秘 第4565节</h3>
<h4 align="center"></h4><p><strong>4565.</strong>“那棵树名叫亚伦巴古”表被逐出的属世层的性质。这从“名叫”的含义清楚可知，“名叫”是指性质（参看<a href="144.htm">144</a>，<a href="145.htm">145</a>，<a href="1754.htm">1754</a>，<a href="1896.htm">1896</a>，<a href="2009.htm">2009</a>，<a href="2724.htm">2724</a>，<a href="3006.htm">3006</a>，<a href="3421.htm">3421</a>节）。在原文，“亚伦巴古”表示“哭泣的橡树”，这个地方之所以被如此称呼，是因为“橡树”表示属世层的最低层，遗传的邪恶就被丢进这一层，最后从这一层被丢出去。“橡树”表示属世层的最低层，以及持续到永远之物（参看<a href="4552.htm">4552</a>节）。但“哭泣”表示最后的告别；因此，当死人埋葬时，为他们哭泣成为习俗，尽管人们知道，通过埋葬被抛弃的，只是尸体；就其内在而言，那些曾活在其尸体中的人仍旧活着。由此可见“亚伦巴古”或“哭泣的橡树”所表之物是何性质。</p>

And he called the name of it Allon-bacuth. That this signifies the quality of the natural in that it was expelled, is evident from the signification of "calling a name," as being the quality (see n. 
144, 145, 1754, 1896, 2009, 2724, 3006, 3421). "Allon-bacuth" in the original language means "the oak of weeping," and the place was so called because the "oak" denotes the lowest of the natural, into 
which, and at last out of which, hereditary evil was cast. (That the "oak" denotes the lowest of the natural, and also what is perpetual, see above, n. 4552.) But "weeping" signifies the last farewell, 
and therefore it was customary to weep for the dead when they were buried, although it was known that only the dead body was rejected by burial, and that they who had been therein were alive in respect 
to their interiors. Hence it is evident what is the quality of that which is signified by "Allon-bacuth" or the "oak of weeping." </p>

<p align="center"><b>Elliott(1983-1999) 4565</b></p><p><b>4565.</b>
'And its name was called Allon Bacuth' means the essential nature of the natural which was cast out. This is clear from the meaning of 'calling the name' as the essential nature, dealt with in <a href="144.htm">144</a>, <a href="145.htm">145</a>, <a href="1754.htm">1754</a>, <a href="1896.htm">1896</a>, <a href="2009.htm">2009</a>, <a href="2724.htm">2724</a>, <a href="3006.htm">3006</a>, <a href="3421.htm">3421</a>. In the original language 'Allon Bacuth' means an oak of weeping; and that place was called this because 'an oak' means the lowest part of the natural, into which 
and finally outside which hereditary evil was cast. As regards 'an oak' meaning the lowest part of the natural and also that which lasts for ever, see <a href="4552.htm">4552</a>. But 'weeping' means the final farewell - 
hence the custom to weep for the dead when they were being buried, even though people recognized that through burial merely the corpse was cast away, and those who had lived in what was now their corpse 
were still alive so far as the interior aspects of them were concerned. From this one may see what the essential nature is that is meant by 'Allon Bacuth' or an oak of weeping. </p>

<p align="center"><b>Latin(1748-1756) 4565</b>
</p><b>4565.</b>
`Et vocavit nomen ejus Allon Bacuth': quod significet quale naturalis quod expulsum, constat ex significatione `vocare nomen' quod sit quale, de qua n. 144, 145, 1754, 1896, 2009, 2724, 3006, 3421; 
`Allon Bacuth' in lingua originali significat quercum fletus, et ita dictus est locus ex causa quia `quercus' est infimum naturalis, in quod et demum extra quod ejectum est malum hereditarium; quod 
`quercus' sit infimum naturalis, et quoque perpetuum, videatur n. 4552; `fletus' autem significat ultimum vale, inde sollemne fuit flere mortuos cum sepeliebantur, tametsi sciebant quod modo cadaver 
per sepulturam rejiceretur, et illi qui in cadavere fuerant, quoad interiora {1} viverent; inde patet quale quod per Allon Bacuth seu quercum fletus significatur.      @1 interiorem hominem$ </p>
