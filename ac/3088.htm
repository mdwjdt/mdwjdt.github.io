<h3 align="center" class="ired">属天的奥秘 第3088节</h3>
<h4 align="center"></h4><p><strong>3088.</strong>“仆人跑上前去迎着她说”表通过神圣良善调查。这从“跑上前去迎着她”和“说”的含义清楚可知：“跑上前去迎着她”是指调查事情是否如他心里所说的那样（内义如此指示）；“说”是指发觉（前面已频繁说明），因而是指调查。之所以通过神圣良善调查，是因为仆人在此是代表他的主人，即亚伯拉罕和以撒行事。因为凡被差的都具有差他者的身份，这在圣言中是很常见的事。如当谈到使者或天使时，他们先作为使者或天使被提及，后来就被称为“耶和华”。从荆棘里向摩西显现的使者（出埃及记<a href="http://39-27.cn/出3.2.htm">3:2</a>，<a href="http://39-27.cn/出3.4.htm">4</a>），以及向基甸显现的使者（士师记<a href="http://39-27.cn/士6.11.htm">6:11</a>-<a href="http://39-27.cn/士6.12.htm">12</a>，<a href="http://39-27.cn/士6.14.htm">14</a>）就是这种情形。这也解释了为何下一节利百加称呼他为“我主”。</p>

The servant ran to meet her, and said. That this signifies exploration from Divine good, is evident from the signification of "running to meet her," as being an exploration as to whether the case was 
as he had spoken in his heart (the internal sense so dictates); also from the signification of "saying," as being to perceive (often shown before) and thus to explore. That this was from Divine good, 
is because the servant here acts in the stead of his lord, that is, of Abraham and also of Isaac; for he that is sent puts on the personality of him who sends. This is often the case in the Word, as 
when angels are spoken of who are first mentioned as angels, and are afterwards called "Jehovah" (as the angel who appeared to Moses in the bush, Exod. 3:2, 4; and the angel that appeared to Gideon, Judges 
6:11-12, 14). For the same reason Rebekah addresses him as "my lord" in the next verse. </p>

'The servant ran to meet her, and said' means investigation by Divine Good. This is clear from the meaning of 'running to meet her' as investigating to see whether things turned out as he declared in 
his heart- the internal sense dictates this; as well as from the meaning of 'saying' as perceiving, often dealt with already, and thus also as investigating. The reason the investigation was made by 
Divine Good is that here the servant is acting on behalf of his master<A name="fntext1"></a><A href="#fn1"><sup>a</sup></a> - who was Abraham, and also Isaac. For one who has been sent assumes the identity of him who sends him, as is the case many times 
in the Word - such as when one reads about angels, they are first spoken of as angels, but afterwards are called Jehovah. This was so with him who appeared to Moses in the bramble bush, <a href="http://bible.gospelcom.net/cgi-bin/bible?passage=Exod%203:2,%204&amp;version=ESV&amp;interface=print&amp;showfn=yes&amp;showxref">Exod 3:2, 4</a> 
and following verses, and with the one who appeared to Gideon, <a href="http://bible.gospelcom.net/cgi-bin/bible?passage=Judg%206:11,%2012,%2014&amp;version=ESV&amp;interface=print&amp;showfn=yes&amp;showxref">Judg 6:11, 12, 14</a>. This also explains why Rebekah addresses him as 'my lord' in the next verse.<A name="fntext1"></a><A href="#fn1"><sup>a</sup></a>

`Cucurrit servus obviam illi, et dixit': quod significet explorationem a Divino Bono, constat a significatione `currere obviam illi' quod sit explorare num ita se habeat prout corde suo locutus, internum 
sensus hoc dictat; tum ex significatione `dicere' quod sit percipere, de qua saepius prius, ita quoque explorare; quod a Divino Bono, est quia servus hic agit vicem domini sui, nempe Abrahami, tum 
quoque Jishaki; missus enim induit personam mittentis, ut pluries in Verbo; sicut de angelis legitur quod primum nominentur angeli, {1}et dein vocentur Jehovah, ut qui apparuit Mosi in rubo, Exod. 
iii 2, 4 seq. et qui apparuit Gideoni, Jud. vi 11, 12, 14: inde etiam est quod Rebecca ad illum dicat, `domine mi,' vers. seq. @1 et dein vocantur Jehovah after 12, 14 below.$ </p>
