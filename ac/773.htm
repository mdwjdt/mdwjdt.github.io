<h4 align="center"></h4><p><strong>773.</strong>“他们”通常表教会成员，或属于该教会的一切。这一点从以下事实清楚可知：“他们”是指刚才提及名字的人物，即挪亚，闪，含和雅弗。尽管他们有四个，但他们一起构成一个整体。因为挪亚通常用来表示古教会，作为母或种，它包括源自它的众教会。因此，“他们”表古教会。被称为闪，含和雅弗的所有众教会一起构成被称为古教会的教会。</p>

<p><strong>[NCE]773.</strong> The symbolism of they as the people of the church as a whole, or every quality displayed by this church, is evident from the fact that it refers to the people just named: Noah, Shem, Ham, and Japheth. Although there were four of them, together they form a unit.<br />Noah, who in general stands for the ancient church, held within him the churches that grew out of the ancient one, as a progenitor or a seed holds such things within it, and this is why they symbolizes the ancient church. All the churches referred to as Shem, Ham, and Japheth, taken together, form a single church, called the ancient church. </p>
<p align="center"><b>Potts(1905-1910) 773</b></p><p><b>773.</b>
That by "they" is signified the man of the church in general, or all that was of that church, is evident from its referring to those who were named just before, that is, to Noah, Shem, Ham, and Japheth, 
who, although they are four, yet together constitute a one. In "Noah" by whom the Ancient Church in general is meant, are contained, as in a parent or seed, the churches that were derived from that 
church; and for this reason by "they" is signified the Ancient Church. All those churches which were called "Shem, Ham, and Japheth" together constitute the church which is called the Ancient Church. </p>

<p align="center"><b>Elliott(1983-1999) 773</b></p><p><b>773.</b>
'They' means in general the member of the Church or everything that belonged to that Church. This is clear from the fact that 'they' refers to the characters who have just been mentioned by name, Noah, 
Shem, Ham, and Japheth. Although there are four of them, they nevertheless together constitute a single whole. For Noah, who is used in general to mean the Ancient Church, includes, as the parent or 
seed, the Churches that sprang from it. Hence 'they' means the Ancient Church. All of the Churches which are called Shem, Ham, and Japheth, together constitute the Church called the Ancient Church. </p>

<p align="center"><b>Latin(1748-1756) 773</b>
</p><b>773.</b>
Quod per 'illi' significetur in genere homo Ecclesiae, seu omne quod fuit hujus Ecclesiae, constat ex eo quod se referant ad illos qui mox nominati sunt, ad Noahum, Shemum, Hamum et Japhetum; qui tametsi 
quatuor sunt, usque simul constituunt unum: in 'Noaho,' per quem in genere intelligitur antiqua Ecclesia, continentur sicut in parente aut semine, Ecclesiae inde; quare per 'illi' significatur Ecclesia 
Antiqua; omnes illae Ecclesiae quae Shem, Ham et Japheth dictae sunt, constituunt simul Ecclesiam quae Ecclesia Antiqua vocatur. </p>
