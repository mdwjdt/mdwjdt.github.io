<h3 align="center" class="ired">属天的奥秘 第4810节</h3>
<h4 align="center"></h4><p><strong>4810.</strong>由此可见主所说的这些话是什么意思，它们决不可照文字来理解。也就是说，主在某个最后时期在荣耀中来临，所有圣天使都跟着祂，祂将要坐在荣耀的宝座上，审判聚集在祂面前的万族。准确地说，意思是这样：每个人在从世上的生命过渡到永生时，都要照着自己的生活受审判</p>

From all this it is evident what these words of the Lord involve, and that they are not to be understood according to the letter (namely, that the Lord at some last time will come in glory, and all the 
holy angels with Him, and will sit upon a throne of glory, and judge all nations gathered before Him), but that everyone will be judged according to his life, when he passes out of life in the world 
into life eternal.            GENESIS 38 </p>
<p>     1. And it came to pass in this time and Judah went down from his brethren, and turned aside even to a man, an Adullamite, and his name was Hirah.  
    2. And Judah saw there a daughter of a man, a Canaanite, and her name was Shua; and he took her, and came to her.      3. And she conceived and bare a son, and he called his name Er.      4. And 
she conceived again and bare a son, and she called his name Onan.      5. And she added again and bare a son, and she called his name Shelah; and he was in Chezib when she bare him.      6. And Judah 
took a woman for Er his firstborn, and her name was Tamar.   7. And Er, Judah's firstborn, was evil in the eyes of Jehovah; and Jehovah caused him to die.      8. And Judah said unto Onan, Come 
to thy brother's wife, and perform the duty of a husband's brother unto her, and raise up seed to thy brother.      9. And Onan knew that the seed would not be his; and it came to pass when he came to 
his brother's wife, and he destroyed it to the earth, that he might not give seed to his brother.      10. And the thing which he did was evil in the eyes of Jehovah; and He caused him also to die.  
    11. And Judah said to Tamar his daughter-in-law, Remain a widow in thy father's house, till Shelah my son be grown up; for he said, Lest he also die, like his brethren. And Tamar went and abode 
in her father's house.      12. And the days were multiplied, and Shua's daughter died, the wife of Judah; and Judah was comforted, and went up unto the shearers of his flock, he and his companion Hirah 
the Adullamite, to Timnah.      13. And it was told Tamar, saying, Behold, thy father-in-law goeth up to Timnah to shear his flock.      14. And she put off from upon her the garments of her widowhood, 
and covered herself in a veil, and wrapped herself, and sat in the gate of the fountains which is upon the way to Timnah; for she saw that Shelah was grown up, and she was not given unto him 
for a woman.      15. And Judah saw her, and thought her to be a harlot, because she had covered her face.      16. And he turned aside unto her to the way, and said, Grant I pray that I may come to 
thee; for he knew not that she was his daughter-in-law. And she said, What wilt thou give me, that thou mayest come to me?      17. And he said, I will send thee a kid of the goats from the flock. And 
she said, If thou wilt give a pledge, till thou send it?      18. And he said, What pledge shall I give thee? And she said, Thy signet, and thy kerchief, and thy staff that is in thy hand. And he 
gave them to her, and came to her; and she conceived to him.      19. And she arose, and went, and put off her veil from upon her, and put on the garments of her widowhood.      20. And Judah sent the 
kid of the goats by the hand of his companion the Adullamite, to receive the pledge from the woman's hand; and he found her not.      21. And he asked the men of that place, saying, Where is the harlot 
that was at the fountains upon the way? And they said, There was no harlot there.      22. And he returned to Judah and said, I have not found her; and also the men of the place said, There was 
no harlot there.      23. And Judah said, Let her take it to her, haply we shall be put to shame; behold I sent this kid, and thou hast not found her.      24. And it came to pass about three months 
after, and it was told Judah, saying, Tamar thy daughter-in-law hath played the harlot; and moreover, behold she is with child to whoredoms. And Judah said, Bring her forth, and let her be burnt.  
    25. She was brought forth, and she sent to her father-in-law, saying, By the man whose these are am I with child; and she said, Acknowledge I pray thee whose are these, the signet and the kerchief 
and the staff.      26. And Judah acknowledged them, and said, She is more just than I; forasmuch as I gave her not to Shelah my son. And he added no further to know her.      27. And it came to pass 
in the time of her travail, and behold twins were in her womb.      28. And it came to pass when she travailed, that one put out a hand; and the midwife took and bound double-dyed upon his hand, saying, 
This came out first.      29. And it came to pass as he drew back his hand, that behold his brother came out; and she said, Wherefore hast thou broken upon thee a breach? And he called his name 
Perez.      30. And afterward came out his brother, that had the double-dyed upon his hand; and he called his name Zerah. </p>

From this one may see what these words spoken by the Lord imply and that they must not be understood literally. That is to say, they must not be taken to mean that the Lord is going at some last phase 
to come in glory and all the holy angels with Him, that He is going to sit on a throne of glory, and that He is going to judge all nations gathered together before Him. Rather, the meaning is that each 
person will be judged according to what his life is, when he passes over from life in the world to eternal life. </p>

Onan knew that the seed would not be his; and so it was, when he came [in] to his brother's wife (uxor), that he spilled it on the ground,<A name="fntext1"></a><A href="#fn1"><sup>a</sup></a> so that he should not provide seed for his brother. </p>
<p><LI value='10'> 
And what he had done was evil in the eyes of Jehovah; and He caused him to die also. </p>
<p><LI value='11'> And Judah said to Tamar his daughter-in-law, Remain a widow in your father's house, until Shelah my son is grown

<p><LI value='12'> And the days were multiplied, and Shua's daughter died, the wife of Judah; and Judah 
was comforted, and he went up to the shearers of his flock, he and his companion Hirah the Adullamite, to Timnah. </p>

<p><LI value='14'> And she took off the clothes of her widowhood from upon her, and covered herself with a veil, and concealed herself, and sat in the gate of the fountains, which

<p><LI value='15'> And Judah saw her and supposed that she was a prostitute, because she had covered her 
face. </p>
<p><LI value='16'> And he turned aside to her at the wayside, and said, Allow me now to come [in] to you; for he did not know that she was his daughter-in-law. And she said, What do you give me for coming

<p><LI value='17'> And he said, I will send a kid of the she-goats from the flock. And she said, If you give a pledge until you send it. </p>

<p><LI value='19'> And she rose up and went, and took off her veil

<p>     1.  Et factum in tempore hoc, et descendit Jehudah ex fratribus suis, et declinavit usque ad virum Adullamitam, et nomen ejus Hirah.      2.  Et vidit ibi Jehudah filiam viri Canaanitae, 
et nomen ejus Shua, et accepit illam et venit ad illam.      3.  Et concepit et peperit filium, et vocavit {1} nomen ejus Er.      4.  Et concepit adhuc et peperit filium, et vocavit {1} nomen ejus 
Onan.      5.  Et addidit adhuc et peperit filium, et vocavit {1} nomen ejus Shelah; et fuit in Kezib in parere illam eum.      6.  Et accepit Jehudah mulierem Ero primogenito suo, et nomen illius 
Tamar.      7. Et fuit Er primogenitus Jehudae malus in oculis JEHOVAE, et mori fecit eum JEHOVAH.      8.  Et dixit Jehudah ad Onan, Veni ad uxorem fratris tui, et leviratum praesta illi, 
et excita semen fratri tuo.      9. Et novit Onan quod non sibi esset semen, et fuit, cum venit ad uxorem fratris sui, et perdidit ad terram, ut non daret semen fratri suo.      10.  Et fuit malum 
in oculis JEHOVAE quod fecit, et mori fecit etiam eum.      11.  Et dixit Jehudah Tamari nurui suae, Mane vidua domo patris tui, usque adolescit Shelah filius meus, quia dixit, Forte moriatur etiam 
hic, sicut fratres ejus; et ivit Tamar, et mansit domo patris sui.      12.  Et multiplicati dies, et moriebatur filia Shuae uxor Jehudae, et consolatus Jehudah, et ascendit ad tonsores gregis 
sui, is et Hirah socius ejus Adullamita, Timnatham.      13.  Et indicatum Tamari, dicendo, Ecce socer tuus ascendit Timnatham ad tondendum gregem suum.      14.  Et removit vestes viduitatis suae 
a super se, et obtexit in peplo, et operuit se; et sedit in ostio fontium, qui super via Timnatham; quia vidit quod adolevit Shelah, et illa non data ei in mulierem.      15.  Et vidit illam Jehudah, 
et reputabat illam meretricem, quia obtexit facies suas.      16.  Et declinavit ad illam ad viam, et dixit, Da quaeso veniam ad te; quia non novit quod nurus ejus illa; et dixit, Quid das mihi 
quod venias ad me?      17.  Et dixit, Ego mittam haedum caprarum de grege; et dixit, Si des arrhabonem usque ad mittere te.      18.  Et dixit, Quae arrhabo quam dabo tibi? et dixit, Sigillum tuum, 
panniculum tuum, et baculum tuum qui in manu tua; et dedit illi, et venit ad illam, et concepit ei.      19.  Et surrexit, et ivit, et removit peplum suum a super se, et induit vestes viduitatis 
suae.      20.  Et misit Jehudah haedum caprarum in manu socii sui Adullamitae, ad accipiendum arrhabonem e manu mulieris, et non invenit illam.      21.  Et interrogavit viros loci illius, dicendo, 
Ubi scortum illud in fontibus super via? et dixerunt, Non fuit ibi scortum.      22. Et reversus ad Jehudam, et dixit, Non inveni illam, et etiam viri loci dixerunt, Non fuit ibi scortum.  
    23.  Et dixit Jehudah, Accipiat sibi, forte erimus contemptui, ecce misi haedum hunc, et tu non invenisti illam.      24.  Et fuit circiter a tribus mensibus, et indicatum Jehudae, dicendo, Scortata 
Tamar nurus tua, et etiam ecce gravida ad scortationes; et dixit Jehudah, Educite illam, et comburatur.      25.  Illa educta, et illa misit ad socerum suum, dicendo, Viro, cui haec, ego gravida, 
et dixit, Agnosce quaeso, cui sigillum et panniculus et baculus, haec.      26.  Et agnovit Jehudah, et dixit, Justa prae me, quia propterea quod non dedi illam Shelae filio meo; et non addidit amplius 
cognoscere illam.      27.  Et factum in tempore parere illam, et ecce gemini in utero illius.      28.  Et factum in parere illam, et dedit manum, et accepit obstetrix, et ligavit super 
manu ejus dibaphum, dicendo, Hic exivit prius.      29.  Et factum, sicut reducit manum suam, et ecce exivit frater ejus, et dixit, Quid rupisti super te rupturam? et vocavit nomen ejus Perez.  
    30.  Et postea exivit frater ejus, cujus super manu dibaphum, et vocavit nomen ejus Zerah.      @1 A i (ille) in v. 3 and (illa) in vv. 4 and 5 to show Heb verb is masc. and fem. respectively.$ </p>
