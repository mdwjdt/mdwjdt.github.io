<h3 align="center" class="ired">属天的奥秘 第115节</h3>
<h4 align="center"></h4><p><strong>115.</strong>当上古之人说起某“地”时，他们理解为那地的象征义，正如今日之人将迦南地和锡安山理解为天堂，而非某块地或某座山。此处的“哈腓拉全地”也是同理，后面它再次被提起，说以实玛利的子孙居住的地方，是“从哈腓拉直到埃及前的书珥，正在亚述的道上”（创世记<a href="http://39-27.cn/创25.18.htm">25:18</a>）。属天之人将这话理解为聪明及聪明的流动，将“环绕”——比逊河“环绕哈腓拉全地”，理解为流入。类似地，对于亚伦以弗得肩带上的红玛瑙被镶嵌（被环绕）在金槽中（出埃及记<a href="http://39-27.cn/出28.11.htm">28:11</a>），他们理解为爱之良善当流入信之真理。诸如此类的。</p>

<p><strong>[NCE]115.</strong> The earliest people, when mentioning the names of various lands, had the symbolism of those places in mind. The same is true of people today who adopt the idea that the land of Canaan and Mount Zion symbolize heaven. When such people hear these names, they do not even think of the land or the mountain but only about the things they stand for. Likewise in the present verse in regard to the land of Havilah, which comes up again in <a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_115/bible_king-james-version_genesis_25_18" target=_top>Genesis 25:18</a>; in that verse the subject is Ishmael's offspring, who "lived from Havilah all the way to Shur, which is before Egypt as you come into Assyria."<br />For people who look at things the way heaven does, what the words of this verse suggest is simply intelligence and what stems from intelligence. They take circling, for instance (as in "the river Pishon circles the whole land of Havilah"), to mean "flowing in." So the fact that gold settings circled the shoham stones on the shoulders of Aaron's ephod (<a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_115/bible_king-james-version_exodus_28_11" target=_top>Exodus 28:11</a>) suggests to them that the good we love flows into the truth we believe. There are many other examples. </p>

When the most ancient people spoke of "lands" they understood what was signified by them, just as those at the present day who have an idea that the land of Canaan and Mount Zion signify heaven, do not 
so much as think of any land or mountain when these places are mentioned, but only of the things which they signify. It is so here with the "land of Havilah" which is mentioned again in Genesis 25:18, 
where it is said of the sons of Ishmael, that they "dwelt from Havilah even unto Shur, which is before Egypt, as thou goest toward Assyria." Those who are in a heavenly idea perceive from these words 
nothing but intelligence, and what flows from intelligence. So by to "compass"-as where it is said that the river Pishon "compasseth the whole land of Havilah"-they perceive a flowing in; as also 
in the onyx stones on the shoulders of Aaron's ephod being encompassed with ouches of gold (Exod. 28:11), they perceive that the good of love should inflow into the truth of faith. And so in many other 
instances. </p>

<p align="center"><b>Elliott(1983-1999) 115</b></p><p><b>115.</b>
When the most ancient people mentioned parts of the earth they understood the things these meant, just as people nowadays who have the idea that the Land of Canaan and Mount Zion mean heaven do not even 
think of a land or of a mountain when these locations are mentioned, but only of the things they mean. The same applies hereto the land of Havillah. That land is also mentioned in <a href="http://bible.gospelcom.net/cgi-bin/bible?passage=Gen%2025:18&amp;version=ESV&amp;interface=print&amp;showfn=yes&amp;showxref">Gen 25:18</a>, where 
it is said, in reference to the sons of Ishmael, that 'they dwelt from Havillah to Shur which is opposite Egypt as you come towards Asshur'. People who have heavenly ideas perceive from these words 
nothing else but intelligence and what flows from intelligence. And in the same way by encompassing in the statement 'the river Pishon encompasses the whole land of Havillah' they perceive flowing in. 
And by the shoham stones on the shoulder-pieces of Aaron's ephod being encompassed with settings of gold, <a href="http://bible.gospelcom.net/cgi-bin/bible?passage=Exod%2028:11&amp;version=ESV&amp;interface=print&amp;showfn=yes&amp;showxref">Exod 28:11</a>, they perceive that the good of love was flowing into the truth of faith. The same 
is found many times in other places.  </p>

Antiquissimi cum nominarunt terras, intellexerunt quae significabant; sicut qui hodie in idea sunt quod 'terra Canaan' et 'Mons Zionis' significent caelum, ii, cum nominantur, ne quidem cogitant de 
terra aut monte sed solum de illis quae significant; ita hic per 'terram Havillah,' quae etiam nominatur Gen. xxv {x}18, ubi agitur de filiis Ismaelis, quod 'habitaverint a Havillah usque ad Shur, quod 
juxta facies Aegypti, qua venitur in Asshur.'  Qui in idea caelesti sunt, non percipiunt ex his aliud quam intelligentiam et quae ab intelligentia fluunt: sicut etiam per 'circumdare,' quod fluvius 
Pishon circumdet totam terram Havillah- percipiunt influere; sicut quod lapides shoham qui super humeris ephodi Aharonis circumdati essent fundis auri, Exod. xxviii 11, quod bonum amoris influeret in 
verum fidei; ita multoties alibi.
