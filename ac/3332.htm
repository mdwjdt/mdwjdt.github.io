<h3 align="center" class="ired">属天的奥秘 第3332节</h3>
<h4 align="center"></h4><p><strong>3332.</strong>“于是雅各将饼和扁豆汤给了以扫”表生活的良善被赋予真理的良善和教义的良善。 这从“以扫”的代表，以及“饼”和“扁豆汤”的含义清楚可知：“以扫”是指生活的良善（<a href="3300.htm">3300</a>，<a href="3322.htm">3322</a>节）；“饼”一般是指爱之善，无论这善是属天的还是属灵的（<a href="276.htm">276</a>，<a href="680.htm">680</a>，<a href="2165.htm">2165</a>，<a href="2177.htm">2177</a>节），因而是指真理的良善，因为这善是属灵之善；“扁豆汤”是指教义的良善，因为“汤”表积聚在一起的教义事物（<a href="3316.htm">3316</a>节），而“扁豆”是指本质上存在于这些教义中的良善。雅各将它们给了以扫，在内义上就表示这些良善通过雅各所代表的真理教义而来（<a href="3305.htm">3305</a>节）。<br />在最后这一节，这句话以及接下来的话描述了属灵之人在重生时，在真理与良善方面所取得的进展。也就是说，他先学习真理的教义，接下来被它们，即教义的良善深深打动，然后通过洞察这些教义而被它们里面所具有的真理情感，也就是真理的良善激励，最后愿意照它们，也就是生活的良善而生活。属灵之人在重生时，就是以这种方式从真理的教义向生活的良善发展。不过，一旦他到了那个点，也就是处于生活的良善，秩序就颠倒过来，他通过这良善看待真理的良善，通过真理的良善看待教义的良善，通过教义的良善看待真理的教义。由此可知人如何从一个感官之人变得属灵，以及他变得属灵后具有什么样的性质。<br />考虑问题仔细的人可以看出，这些良善，也就是说，生活的良善，真理的良善和教义的良善彼此都不同。生活的良善是从意愿发出的；真理的良善是从理解力发出的；而教义的良善是从记忆知识发出的。教义的良善拥有其它那三类良善在里面。<br />“扁豆”表教义的良善，这从以下事实明显可知：小麦、大麦、豆类、扁豆、小米和耐寒小麦都是诸如饼所指的那类事物，尽管它们因种类而各不相同。“饼”一般表良善，这从前面的阐述和说明（<a href="276.htm">276</a>，<a href="680.htm">680</a>，<a href="2165.htm">2165</a>，<a href="2177.htm">2177</a>节）明显可知；因而不同种类的良善就由上述谷物和豆类来表示，较为珍贵的那类良善由“小麦和大麦”来表示，次一点由“豆类和扁豆”来表示，这一点从以西结书也能看得很清楚：<br />你要为自己取小麦、大麦、豆子、扁豆、小米、粗麦，把它们装在一个器皿中，用以为自己做饼。（以西结书<a href="http://39-27.cn/结4.9.htm">4:9</a>）</p>

<p align="center"><b>Potts(1905-1910) 3332</b></p><p><b>3332.</b>
And Jacob gave Esau bread and pottage of lentils. That this signifies the good of life gifted with the good of truth and the good of doctrinal things, is evident from the representation of Esau, as being 
the good of life (n. 3300, 3322); and from the signification of "bread," as being the good of love in general, both celestial and spiritual (n. 276, 680, 2165, 2177), thus also the good of truth, 
for this is spiritual good; and from the signification of "pottage of lentils," as being the good of doctrinal things; for "pottage" signifies a chaotic mass of doctrinal things (n. 3316), and "lentils" 
the good thereof. That Jacob gave them to Esau, in the internal sense signifies that these goods come through the doctrine of truth, which is represented by Jacob (n. 3305). [2] In this last verse, 
by these words and those which follow there is described the progress as to truth and good of the spiritual man when being regenerated, namely, that he first learns the doctrinal things of truth, next 
is affected by them (which is the good of the doctrinal things), then that by taking a mental view of these doctrinal things he is affected with the truths in them (which is the good of truth), and 
lastly that he wills to live according to them, which is the good of life. In this way the spiritual man when being regenerated advances from the doctrine of truth to the good of life. But when he is 
in the good of life the order is inverted, and from this good he looks to the good of truth, from this to the good of doctrinal things, and from this to the doctrinal things of truth. From this it may 
be known how man from being a sensuous man becomes spiritual, and of what quality he is when he becomes spiritual. [3] That these goods, namely, the good of life, the good of truth, and the good of 
doctrinal things, are distinct from each other can be seen by those who carefully consider the matter. The good of life is that which flows from the will; the good of truth is that which flows from 
the understanding; and the good of doctrinal things is that which flows from memory-knowledge. The good which is doctrinal has these other goods within it.  [4] That "lentils" signify the good of doctrinal 
things, is evident from the fact that wheat, barley, beans, lentils, millet, spelt, are such things as mean bread, but with a difference according to the species; that "bread" in general denotes 
good is manifest from what has been stated and shown above (n. 276, 680, 2165, 2177); thus different species of good are signified by the cereals in question, the more noble species of good by "wheat 
and barley," but the less noble by "beans and lentils;" as is also manifest from Ezekiel: </p>
<p>     Take thou also unto thee wheat, and barley, and beans, and lentils, and millet, and spelt, and put them 
into one vessel, and make thee bread thereof (Ezek. 4:9). </p>

<p align="center"><b>Elliott(1983-1999) 3332</b></p><p><b>3332.</b>
'Jacob gave Esau bread and lentil pottage' means that the good of life was given the good of truth and the good of doctrine. This is clear from the representation of 'Esau' as the good of life, dealt 
with in <a href="3300.htm">3300</a>, <a href="3322.htm">3322</a>; from the meaning of 'bread' as in general the good of love - both celestial and spiritual good - dealt with in <a href="276.htm">276</a>, <a href="680.htm">680</a>, <a href="2165.htm">2165</a>, <a href="2177.htm">2177</a>, and so also the good of truth, this being spiritual 
good; and from the meaning of 'lentil pottage' as the good of doctrine, for 'pottage' or soup means the massing together of matters of doctrine, <a href="3316.htm">3316</a>, but 'lentils' the good that exists essentially 
in these. Jacob's giving them to Esau means in the internal sense that those goods come through the doctrine of truth, which Jacob represents, <a href="3305.htm">3305</a>. </p>
<p></p>
<p><b>[2]</b>
 These words and those that follow in this 
final verse describe progress made in regard to truth and good. They describe the situation with the spiritual man while being regenerated, that is to say, how he first learns matters of doctrine concerning 
truth; how next he is stirred by an affection for them, which is the good of doctrine; how after that, through insight into the matters of doctrine, he is stirred by an affection for the truths 
which they hold within them, which is the good of truth; and how at length he desires to live according to them, which is the good of life. Thus while undergoing regeneration the spiritual man advances 
from the doctrine of truth towards the good of life. But once he has reached that point the order is reversed - that good is the point from which he sees the good of truth, the latter the point from 
which he sees the good of doctrine, and this good in turn the point from which he sees matters of doctrine concerning truth. From these considerations it may be known how, from being sensory-minded, 
a person becomes spiritual, and what he is like when he has become spiritual. </p>
<p></p>
<p><b>[3]</b>
 Those varieties of good, that is to say, the good of life, the good of truth, and the good of doctrine, are all 
distinct from one another, as becomes clear to those who weigh the matter up. The good of life is that which issues from the will, the good of truth that which issues from the understanding, while the 
good of doctrine is that which issues from knowledge. Doctrinal teaching is such that it includes all three. It is clear that 'lentils' means the good of doctrine from the fact that wheat, barley, beans, 
lentils, millet, and spelt are such things as are meant by bread, though with specific differences. The fact that 'bread' in general means good is evident from what has been stated and shown in <a href="276.htm">276</a>, <a href="680.htm">680</a>, <a href="2165.htm">2165</a>, <a href="2177.htm">2177</a>; and so specific kinds of good are meant by the grains and beans that have been mentioned - nobler kinds of good by wheat and barley, but less noble by beans and lentils, as also becomes 
evident from these words in Ezekiel, </p>
<blockquote>
You, take for yourself wheat and barley, and beans and lentils, and millet and spelt, and put them into a single vessel, and make them into bread for yourself.

`Jacob dedit Esavo panem et pultem lentium': quod significet bonum vitae donatum bono veri et bono doctrinalium, constat a repraesentatione `Esavi' quod sit bonum vitae, de qua n. 3300, 3322; ex significatione 
`panis' quod sit bonum amoris in genere, tam caeleste quam spirituale, de qua n. 276, 680, 2165, 2177, ita quoque bonum veri, nam hoc est bonum spirituale; et ex significatione `pultis lentium' 
quod sit bonum doctrinalium, `puls' enim seu pulmentum significat congeriem doctrinalium, n. 3316, `lentes' autem bonum (c)eorum; quod Jacob illa dederit Esavo, in sensu interno significat quod 
illa bona sint per doctrinam veri, quae per Jacobum repraesentatur, n. 3305. [2] In ultimo hoc versu per haec verba et per illa quae sequuntur, describitur progressus quoad verum et bonum, quomodo se 
habet apud hominem spiritualem cum regeneratur, nempe quod primum addiscat doctrinalia veri; dein quod illis afficiatur, quod est bonum doctrinalium; postea quod per intuitionem in doctrinalia afficiatur 
veris quae in illis, quod est bonum veri; tandem quod velit vivere secundum illa, quod est bonum vitae; ita homo spiritualis cum regeneratur, procedit a doctrina veri ad bonum vitae: cum autem in 
bono vitae est, tunc invertitur ordo, et ex illo bono spectat bonum veri, ab hoc bonum doctrinalium, et ab hoc doctrinalia veri; ex illis sciri potest quomodo homo a sensuali homine fit spiritualis, et 
qualis homo est, cum spiritualis factus. [3] Quod bona illa, nempe bonum vitae, bonum veri, et bonum doctrinalium inter se distincta sint, constare potest illis qui expendunt; bonum vitae est quod profluit 
ex voluntate, bonum veri quod ex intellectu, bonum autem doctrinalium quod ex scientia; doctrinale est, in quo illa sunt. Quod `lentes' significent bonum doctrinalium, constat ex eo quod tritica, 
hordea, fabae, lentes, milium, zeae, sint talia quae significent panem, sed cum differentia in specie; quod `panis' in genere sit bonum, ex illis quae n. 276, 680, 2165, 2177 dicta et ostensa sunt, 
patet, ita species boni significantur per illa quae nominata sunt, species boni nobiliores per `tritica et hordea,' at minus nobiles per `fabas et lentes,' ut quoque patescit ab his apud Ezechielem,  
         Tu sume tibi tritica et hordea, et fabam et lentes, et      milium et zeas, et des illa in vas unum, et facias illa tibi      ad panem, iv 9, 12, 13. </p>
