<h3 align="center" class="ired">属天的奥秘 第4205节</h3>
<h4 align="center"></h4><p><strong>4205.</strong>“我必不越过这石堆到你那里去；你也不可越过这石堆和柱子到我这里来害我”表决定能从良善流入多少的限度。这从“越过”、“石堆”和“柱子”的含义清楚可知：“越过”在此是指流入；“石堆”是指良善（<a href="4192.htm">4192</a>节）；“柱子”是指真理（<a href="3727.htm">3727</a>，<a href="3728.htm">3728</a>，<a href="4090.htm">4090</a>节）；还因为石堆和柱子用作记号或证据；但在此处用作限度的记号。由于此处所论述的主题是结合，所以从整个思路自然会流入这样的观念：就内义而言，意思是指决定能从良善流入多少的限度。前面说过，结合通过良善实现，良善的流入取决于它被接受的方式。而对良善的接受完全取决于真理，真理是良善所流入的对象。因为良善是主动力或原动力，而真理是接受者；因此一切真理都是接受的器皿（<a href="4166.htm">4166</a>节）。由于真理是良善所流入的器皿，所以真理为良善的流入设定限度。这就是此处决定能从良善流入多少的限度所表示的。 <br />其中情形简要阐述如下：人所认识的真理，无论具有什么样的性质，皆通过情感，也就是通过爱所具有的某种快乐进入他的记忆。没有情感，或没有爱所具有的快乐，没有什么东西能进入人里面，因为他的生命就在于这些。当类似快乐，连同与它们相联的许多其它事物返回时，所进入的事物会被重新引入；同样，当这个真理被人自己或某个其他人重新引入时，情感或他的爱所具有的快乐在它进入时以同样的方式再次被激发；它们因结合而彼此粘附。由此可见对真理的情感是何情形。连同对良善的情感一起进入的真理，在有类似情感返回时，就会被重新引入；情感在类似真理返回时，也会被重新引入。由此明显可知，真理连同纯正的情感绝无可能被植入并扎根，除非此人处于良善。因为对真理的纯正情感来源于良善，良善则来源于对主之爱和对邻之仁。良善从主流入，但只固定在真理里面；事实上，真理欣然接纳良善，如同欢迎贵宾，因为这二者情投意合。由此还明显可知，真理的性质决定了良善被接受的方式。彼此过着仁爱生活的外邦人所认识的真理具有这样的性质：从主所流入的良善也能在它们里面如同贵宾那样被欣然接纳。但只要他们活在这世上，他们的情况就和从圣言拥有真理，并基于这些真理过着属灵仁爱生活的基督徒不一样（<a href="2589.htm">2589</a>-<a href="2604.htm">2604</a>节）。</p>

That I will not pass over this heap to thee, and that thou shalt not pass over this heap to me, and this pillar, for evil. That this signifies the limit defining how much can flow in from good, is evident 
from the signification here of "passing over," as being to flow in; from the signification of a "heap," as being good (n. 4192); and from the signification of a "pillar," as being truth (concerning 
which n. 3727, 3728, 4090); and also because both the heap and the pillar were for a sign or for a witness; but here, for a sign of the limit. As conjunction is treated of, the connection involves 
that in the internal sense the signification is the limit defining how much can flow in from good. It has been stated above that conjunction is effected by good, and that good flows in according to the 
reception. But the reception of good is not possible in any other way than according to truths, truths being that which good flows into; for good is the agent, and truth is the recipient; and therefore 
all truths are recipient vessels (n. 4166). As truths are that which good flows into, truths are what limit the inflow of good; and this is what is here meant by the limit that defines how much can 
flow in from good.  [2] How the case herein is shall be briefly stated. The truths with man, no matter what they may be, or of whatever nature, enter into his memory by means of affection, that is, 
by a certain delight which is of love. Without affection (or without the delight which is of love) nothing can enter to man, for in these is his life. The things which have entered are reproduced whenever 
a similar delight recurs, together with many other things which have associated or conjoined themselves with them; and in the same way when the same truth is reproduced by one's self or by another, 
the affection or delight of love which there was when it entered, is in like manner excited again; for being conjoined they cohere. From this it is evident how the case is with the affection of truth; 
for the truth which has entered together with an affection of good, is reproduced when a similar affection recurs; and the affection also is reproduced when a similar truth recurs. It is also manifest 
from this that no truth can ever be implanted with genuine affection, and become rooted interiorly, unless the man is in good; for the genuine affection of truth is from the good which is of love 
to the Lord and of charity toward the neighbor. The good flows in from the Lord, but is not fixed except in truths; for in truths good is welcomed, because they are in accord. From all this it is also 
evident that the reception of good is according to the nature of the truths. The truths that exist with those Gentiles who have lived in mutual charity are of such a nature that the good which inflows 
from the Lord can also find in them a welcome; but so long as they live in this world, not in the same way as with those Christians who have truths from the Word and live from them in spiritual charity 
(n. 2589-2604). </p>

'That I will not pass beyond this heap to you, and that you will not pass beyond this heap and this pillar to me, to do harm' means the limit which determines how much can flow in from good. This is 
clear from the meaning of 'passing beyond' here as flowing in; from the meaning of 'a heap' as good, dealt with in <a href="4192.htm">4192</a>; and from the meaning of 'a pillar' as truth, dealt with in <a href="3727.htm">3727</a>, <a href="3728.htm">3728</a>, <a href="4090.htm">4090</a>. It 
is also clear from the fact that those two objects - a heap and a pillar - stood as a sign or else as a witness, though in this instance they were a sign indicating a limit. Now because a joining together 
is the subject, there flows from the train of thought the idea - in the internal sense - of a limit determining how much can flow in from good. It has been stated above that the joining together 
is effected by means of good, and that the inflow of good is determined by the way it is received. But the reception of good depends entirely on truths, truths being the objects into which good flows. 
For good is the active force and truth the recipient, and therefore all truths are recipient vessels, <a href="4166.htm">4166</a>. And as truths are the vessels into which good flows, truths set the limit to the inflow of 
good. This is what is meant here by a limit determining how much can flow in from good. </p>

<p><b>[2]</b>
 The implications of this are briefly as follows: The truths that a person knows, no matter what kind they 
may be, enter his memory by means of affection, that is, of some delight that accompanies his love. Without affection or delight accompanying his love nothing is able to enter a person, for it is in 
these that his life consists. The things which have entered in are reintroduced when a similar delight returns, together with many other things which have allied or joined themselves to them. And in 
a similar way when the same truth is reintroduced by the individual himself or by somebody else, the affection or delight that accompanied his love when it entered is likewise stimulated, for having been 
joined together they adhere to one another. From this one may see what the situation is with the affection for truth. Truth which has entered in together with an affection for good is reintroduced 
when a similar affection returns, as is affection when a similar truth does so. From this it is also evident that no truth together with genuine affection can possibly be implanted and take root interiorly 
unless the person is governed by good. For a genuine affection for truth has its origins in good, and good stems from love to the Lord and charity towards the neighbour. This good flows in from 
the Lord, but does not become fixed within anything apart from truths, for truths receive good as a guest since the two are congenial. From this it is in addition evident that the nature of the truths 
determines the way in which the good is received. The truths known to gentiles who have led charitable lives with one another are such that in them also good flowing in from the Lord is able to be received 
as a guest. But so long as they are living in the world their situation is not the same as that with Christians who have truths from the Word and lead spiritually charitable lives based on those 
truths, see <a href="2589.htm">2589</a>-<a href="2604.htm">2604</a>. </p>

`Si ego non transibo ad te acervum hunc, et si tu non transibis ad me acervum hunc et statuam hanc, ad malum': quod significet limitem quantum a bono influere possit, constat a significatione `transire' 
hic quod sit influere; a significatione `acervi' quod sit bonum, de qua n. 4192; et a significatione `statuae' quod sit verum, de qua n. 3727, 3728, 4090; et quod utrumque tam acervus quam 
statua essent in signum aut in testem, ibid., hic in signum limitis; quia de conjunctione agitur, ex serie fluit quod in sensu interno sit limes, quantum a bono influere possit.  Quod conjunctio fiat 
per bonum et quod bonum influat secundum receptionem, supra dictum est; receptio autem boni non dari potest aliter quam secundum vera, nam vera sunt in quae bonum influit, est enim bonum agens et 
verum recipiens, quapropter vera omnia sunt vasa recipientia, n. 4166; quia vera sunt in quae bonum influit, sunt vera quae limitant influxum boni; hoc intelligitur hic per limitem quantum a bono 
influere possit.  [2] Quomodo cum hoc se habet, paucis dicendum est: vera apud hominem quaecumque et qualiacumque sunt, intrant in memoriam ejus per affectionem, hoc est, per jucundum quoddam quod 
est amoris; absque affectione seu absque jucundo quod est amoris, nihil potest intrare apud hominem quia in illis est vita ejus; haec quae intrarunt, reproducuntur quando simile jucundum recurrit, 
una cum pluribus aliis quae se associarunt seu conjunxerunt; tum quoque cum idem verum reproducitur a semet vel ab alio, tunc (o)quoque affectio {1} seu jucundum quod fuerat amoris {2} cum intravit, 
pariter excitatur, nam conjuncta cohaerent; inde constare potest quomodo se habet cum affectione veri; verum quod intravit cum affectione boni, reproducitur cum affectio similis recurrit, et quoque 
affectio cum verum simile; inde etiam patet quod nusquam aliquod verum cum genuina affectione possit implantari ac interius radicari nisi homo sit in bono; nam genuina affectio veri est ex bono, 
quod est amoris in Dominum et charitatis erga proximum; bonum hoc influit a Domino, at non figitur quam in veris, nam in veris est hospitium boni, concordant enim; inde quoque patet quod qualia sunt 
vera, talis sit receptio boni; vera apud gentes quae in mutua charitate vixerunt, talia sunt ut bonum a Domino influens etiam in illis hospitari possit, sed quamdiu in mundo vivunt, non ita prout 
apud Christianos, qui vera ex Verbo habent, et in charitate spirituali inde vivunt, videantur n. 2589-2604.      @1 illa$      @2 i ejus$ </p>
