<h3 align="center" class="ired">属天的奥秘 第2405节</h3>
<h4 align="center"></h4><p><strong>2405.</strong>“天明了”表当主的国临近时。这从圣言中“天明”或早晨的含义清楚可知。由于本章论述的主题是教会的相继状态，故经上先论述晚上发生的事，然后论述夜里发生的事，接着论述黎明发生的事，进一步论述日出后发生的事。黎明在此被表述为“天明了”，表示正直人与邪恶分离之时，这种分离在本节直到22节被描述为罗得和他的妻子、女儿被带出去并得救。分离发生在审判之前，这一点从主在马太福音中的话明显看出来：<br />万族要聚集在他面前，祂要把他们彼此分开，好像牧羊人把绵羊和山羊分开一样。（马太福音<a href="http://39-27.cn/太25.32.htm">25:32</a>）<br />在圣言中，这段时期或状态被称为“黎明”，因为那时主来了，或也可说，祂的国临近了。善人的情形也一样，因为到那时，善人身上会闪耀出某种类似早晨的曙光或黎明的东西；故在圣言中，主的降临被比作“早晨（或清晨）”，也被称作“早晨”。如何西阿书：<br />过两天耶和华必使我们苏醒，第三天祂必使我们兴起，我们就在祂面前得以存活。我们务要认识耶和华，竭力追求认识祂；祂出现确如晨光。（何西阿书<a href="http://39-27.cn/何6.2.htm">6:2</a>-<a href="http://39-27.cn/何6.3.htm">3</a>）<br />“两天”表之前的时期和状态。“第三天”表审判或主的到来，因而表主国度的临近（<a href="720.htm">720</a>，<a href="901.htm">901</a>节），主国度的降临或临近被作比“晨光”。<br />撒母耳记：<br />以色列的神他必像日出的晨光，如无云的清晨，雨后的晴光，使地发生嫩草。（撒母耳记下<a href="http://39-27.cn/撒下23.4.htm">23:4</a>）<br />“以色列的神”表主，因为那个教会并没有其他以色列的神，它的每一个特征都代表祂。约珥书：<br />耶和华的日子将到，已经临近。那日是黑暗、幽冥的日子，是密云、乌黑的日子。（约珥书<a href="http://39-27.cn/珥2.1.htm">2:1</a>-<a href="http://39-27.cn/珥2.2.htm">2</a>）<br />这也论及主的降临和祂的国度。经上之所以说“黑暗、幽冥的日子”，是因为那时善人正与恶人分开，如此处罗得与所多玛人分开一样；善人与恶人分开后，恶人就灭亡了。<br />主的降临或其国度的临近，不仅被比作“早晨（或清晨）”，实际上还被称作“早晨（或清晨）”，这一点可见于但以理书：<br />有一位圣者说，这异象、常献的祭和造成荒凉的罪过要到几时呢？祂对我说，要到二千三百个晚上和早晨，圣所才得洁净。所说晚上和早晨的异象是真的。（但以理书<a href="http://39-27.cn/但8.13.htm">8:13</a>-<a href="http://39-27.cn/但8.14.htm">14</a>，<a href="http://39-27.cn/但8.26.htm">26</a>）<br />“早晨”在此明显表示主的降临。诗篇：<br />当你掌权的日子，你的民要以圣洁为荣，甘心献祭，从晨曦的胎腹你就有了你那青春的甘露。（诗篇<a href="http://39-27.cn/诗110.3.htm">110:3</a>）<br />整个诗篇论述的主题都是主和祂在试探中的胜利，也就是祂“掌权的日子”和“以祂的圣洁为荣”。“从晨曦的胎腹”表祂自己，因而表祂借以争战的神性之爱。<br />西番雅书：<br />耶和华在她中间是公义的，断不做乖僻的事；在早晨，祂必在早晨显明审判。（西番雅书<a href="http://39-27.cn/番3.5.htm">3:5</a>），<br />“早晨”表审判的时期和状态，审判和主的到来是一样的，这和主国度的临近是一样的。<br />由于“早晨”表这些事，故为了能代表这些事，经上命令：<br />亚伦和他的儿子要点上灯，从晚上到早晨，要在耶和华面前料理这灯。（出埃及记<a href="http://39-27.cn/出27.21.htm">27:21</a>）<br />“晚上”在此表黎明前的曙光（<a href="2323.htm">2323</a>节）。由于同样的原因，经上命令：<br />祭坛上的火每天早晨都要燃烧。（利未记<a href="http://39-27.cn/利6.5.htm">6:5</a>）<br />逾越节的羔羊和献祭的祭物不可剩下一点留到早晨。（出埃及记<a href="http://39-27.cn/出12.10.htm">12:10</a>；<a href="http://39-27.cn/出23.18.htm">23:18</a>；<a href="http://39-27.cn/出34.25.htm">34:25</a>；利未记<a href="http://39-27.cn/利22.29.htm">22:29</a>-<a href="http://39-27.cn/利22.30.htm">30</a>；民数记<a href="http://39-27.cn/民9.12.htm">9:12</a>）；以此表示当主到来时，献祭要终止。<br />一般来说，“早晨”用来描述破晓之时和日出之时。在这种情况下，“早晨”表对善人和恶人的审判，如本章：<br />太阳已升出地面，罗得到了琐珥；耶和华将硫磺与火降与所多玛和蛾摩拉。（创世记<a href="http://39-27.cn/创19.23.htm">19:23</a>-<a href="http://39-27.cn/创19.24.htm">24</a>）<br />同样，它表示对恶人的审判，诗篇：<br />我每日早晨要灭绝地上所有的恶人，好把一切作孽的从耶和华的城里剪除。（诗篇<a href="http://39-27.cn/诗101.8.htm">101:8</a>）<br />耶利米书：<br />愿那人像耶和华所倾覆而不后悔的城邑；愿他早晨听见哀声。（耶利米书<a href="http://39-27.cn/耶20.16.htm">20:16</a>）<br />由于严格来说，“早晨”表主，祂的到来，因而表其国度的临近，故显而易见，它还有别的意思，即表示一个新教会的兴起，因为这个新教会是主在地上的国，无论总体、具体还是细微。当地上的教会新建时，这个国就是总体上的；当一个人正重生、新造时，它就是具体的；而每当爱与信之善在他里面作工时，它就是细微的，因为主的到来就在于此。所以，就具体和细微意义而言，主在第三日早晨复活（马可福音<a href="http://39-27.cn/可16.2.htm">16:2</a>，<a href="http://39-27.cn/可16.9.htm">9</a>；路加福音<a href="http://39-27.cn/路24.1.htm">24:1</a>；约翰福音<a href="http://39-27.cn/约20.1.htm">20:1</a>）体现这一真理，即祂在重生之人的心智中每天、甚至每一时刻都在复活。</p>

When the dawn arose. That this signifies when the Lord's kingdom is approaching, is evident from the signification in the Word of the "dawn" or "morning." As in this chapter the subject treated of is 
the successive states of the church, that which is done in the evening is first treated of, next that which is done in the night, and there now follows that which is done in the morning twilight, and 
presently that which is done after the sun is gone forth. The twilight is here expressed by "when the dawn arose," and it denotes the time when the upright are being separated from the evil; which separation 
is treated of in this verse, and as far as verse 22, by Lot together with his wife and daughters being led out and saved. That separation precedes Judgment is evident from the Lord's words in 
Matthew: </p>
<p>     Before Him shall be gathered all nations, and He shall separate them one from another, as the shepherd separateth the sheep from the goats (Matt. 25:32). [2] This time or state is called 
in the Word the "dawn," because the Lord then comes; or what is the same, His kingdom then approaches. The case is similar with the good, for at such a time there shines out with them a semblance 
of the morning twilight or dawn; and therefore in the Word the advent of the Lord is compared to the "morning," and is also called the "morning." As in Hosea: </p>
<p>     After two days Jehovah will revive 
us, on the third day He will raise us up, and we shall live before Him; and we shall know, and we shall follow on to know Jehovah; His going forth is as the dawn (Hos. 6:2-3). "Two days" denotes the 
time and state which precedes; the "third day" denotes the Judgment, or the advent of the Lord, and therefore the approach of His kingdom (n. 720, 901), which advent or approach is compared to the "dawn." [3] 
In Samuel: </p>
<p>     The God of Israel is as the light of the morning, the sun riseth, a morning without clouds; from the brightness, from the rain, there is a growth from the earth (2 Sam. 23:4). The 
"God of Israel" denotes the Lord; for no other God of Israel was meant in that church, and He was represented in each and all things of it. In Joel: </p>
<p>     The day of Jehovah cometh, for it is 
nigh at hand; a day of darkness and of thick darkness, a day of cloud and obscurity; as the dawn spread upon the mountains (Joel 2:1-2). Here also the Lord's advent and His kingdom are treated of; it 
is said a "day of darkness and of thick darkness," because the good are then being separated from the evil, as here Lot from the men of Sodom; and after the good have been separated, the evil perish. [4] 
That the Lord's advent or the approach of His kingdom, is not merely compared to the "morning," but is actually called the "morning," may be seen in Daniel: </p>
<p>     A holy one said, How long shall 
be the vision, the continual sacrifice, and the transgression that maketh waste? He said unto me, Until evening and morning, two thousand three hundred, then shall the holy one be justified. The vision 
of the evening and the morning which hath been told is truth (Dan. 8:13-14, 26). "Morning" here manifestly denotes the Lord's advent. In David: </p>
<p>     Thy people are willing offerings in the day of 
thy strength, in honors of holiness, from the womb of the dawn thou hast the dew of thy youth* (Ps. 110:3). In this whole Psalm the subject treated of is the Lord, and His victories in temptations, 
which are the "day of His strength," and the "honors of His holiness;" "from the womb of the dawn," denotes Himself, thus the Divine love from which He fought. [5] In Zephaniah: </p>
<p>     Jehovah in the 
midst of her is righteous, He will not do perversity; in the morning, in the morning will He give judgment for light (Zeph. 3:65). The "morning" denotes the time and state of Judgment, which is the same 
as that of the Lord's advent; and this is the same as the approach of His kingdom.  [6] Because the "morning" signified these things, in order that the same might be represented, it was commanded 
that: </p>
<p>     Aaron and his sons should light up the lamp, and should order it from evening until morning before Jehovah (Exod. 27:21). The "evening" here denotes the twilight before the morning (n. 2323). 
In like manner it was commanded that the fire upon the altar should be kindled every morning (Lev. 6:5); also that nothing of the paschal lamb and of the sanctified things of the sacrifices should 
be left till the morning (Exod. 12:10; 23:18; 34:25; Lev. 22:29-30; Num. 9:12); by which was signified that when the Lord came, sacrifices should cease. [7] In a general sense it is called "Morning" 
both when the dawn appears, and when the sun rises; and in this latter case "morning" denotes the Judgment as it concerns both the good and the evil, as in this chapter: </p>
<p>     The sun was gone forth 
upon the earth, and Lot came unto Zoar; and Jehovah caused it to rain upon Sodom and upon Gomorrah brimstone and fire (Gen. 19:23-24). In like manner insofar as regards the Judgment upon the evil; 
in David: </p>
<p>     In the mornings will I destroy all the wicked of the land, to cut off from the city of Jehovah all the workers of iniquity (Ps. 101:8). And in Jeremiah: </p>
<p>     Let that man be as the cities 
which Jehovah overthrew, and He repenteth not; and let him hear a cry in the morning (Jer. 20:16). As in the proper sense the "morning" signifies the Lord, His advent, and thus the approach of 
His kingdom, it is evident what it signifies besides, namely, the rise of a new church (for this is the Lord's kingdom on earth), and this both in general and in particular, and even in the least particular; 
in general, when any church on the globe is being raised up anew; in particular, when a man is being regenerated, and being made new (for then the Lord's kingdom is arising in him, and he is becoming 
a church); and in the least particular, whenever the good of love and faith is working in him; for in this consists the advent of the Lord. Hence the Lord's resurrection on the third day in the 
morning (Mark 16:2, 9; Luke 24:1; John 20:1) involves all these things (even in the particular and the least particular) in regard to His rising again in the minds of the regenerate every day, and even 
every moment. * Nativitatis; but juventutis elsewhere, as T.C.R. 764. [Rotch ed.] </p>

<p align="center"><b>Elliott(1983-1999) 2405</b></p><p><b>2405.</b>
That 'as dawn ascended' means when the Lord's kingdom draws near is clear from the meaning of 'the dawn' or morning in the Word. Since the subject in this chapter is the successive states of a Church, 
what happened in the evening, then what happened during the night have been referred to first. What took place when it was twilight comes now, and further on what took place after sunrise. Twilight 
is expressed here by 'as dawn ascended', which means the time when the upright are separated from the evil. This separation is described in the present verse to verse 22 as Lot being brought out together 
with his wife and daughters and being saved. The fact that separation takes place prior to judgement is clear from the Lord's words in Matthew, </p>
<blockquote>
Before Him will be gathered all the nations, and 
He will separate them one from another as a shepherd separates the sheep from the goats. <a href="http://bible.gospelcom.net/cgi-bin/bible?passage=Matt%2025:%2032&amp;version=ESV&amp;interface=print&amp;showfn=yes&amp;showxref">Matt 25: 32</a>. 
</blockquote>
<p></p>
<p><b>[2]</b>
 In the Word that period of time or state is called 'the dawn' because that is when the Lord 
comes, or what amounts to the same, when His kingdom draws near. It is similar with the good, for at that time something akin to early morning twilight or the dawn shines with them. This explains why 
in the Word the Lord's coming is compared to and also called 'the morning'. Its comparison to the morning is seen in Hosea, </p>
<blockquote>
Jehovah will revive us after two days, on the third day He will raise us 
up, and we shall live before Him. And we shall know, and we shall press on to know Jehovah. As the dawn is His going forth. <a href="http://bible.gospelcom.net/cgi-bin/bible?passage=Hosea%206:-2,%203&amp;version=ESV&amp;interface=print&amp;showfn=yes&amp;showxref">Hosea 6:-2, 3</a>. 
</blockquote>
<p>'Two days' stands for the period of time and the state which 
precedes. 'Third day' stands for judgement or the Lord's coming, and so for the approach of His kingdom, <a href="720.htm">720</a>, <a href="901.htm">901</a> - a coming or approach which is compared to 'the dawn'. </p>
<p></p>
<p><b>[3]</b>
 In Samuel, </p>
<blockquote>
The 
God of Israel is like morning light, [when] the sun rises on a cloudless morning; from brightness, from rain, grass comes out of the earth. <a href="http://bible.gospelcom.net/cgi-bin/bible?passage=2%20Sam%2023:%204&amp;version=ESV&amp;interface=print&amp;showfn=yes&amp;showxref">2 Sam 23: 4</a>. 
</blockquote>
<p>'The God of Israel' stands for the Lord, for 
no other God of Israel was meant in that Church, where every single feature of that Church was representative of Him. In Joel, </p>
<blockquote>
The day of Jehovah is coming, for it is near, a day of darkness and 
thick darkness, a day of cloud and gloom, like the dawn spread over the mountains. <a href="http://bible.gospelcom.net/cgi-bin/bible?passage=Joel%202:-1,%202&amp;version=ESV&amp;interface=print&amp;showfn=yes&amp;showxref">Joel 2:-1, 2</a>. 
</blockquote>
<p>This too refers to the Lord's coming and His kingdom. The words 'a day of darkness and thick darkness' 
are used because at that time the good are separated from the evil, as Lot was here from the men of Sodom; and after the good have been separated the evil perish. </p>
<p></p>
<p><b>[4]</b>
 The Lord's coming or the approach 
of His kingdom is not compared to the morning but actually called such, as in Daniel, </p>
<blockquote>
The Holy One said, For how long is the vision, the continual [burnt offering], and the desolating transgression? 
He said to me, Up to the evening [when it is becoming] morning two thousand three hundred times, and the Holy One will be justified. The vision of the evening and the morning which has been told 
is the truth. <a href="http://bible.gospelcom.net/cgi-bin/bible?passage=Dan%208:-13,%2014,%2026&amp;version=ESV&amp;interface=print&amp;showfn=yes&amp;showxref">Dan 8:-13, 14, 26</a>. 
</blockquote>
<p>'The morning' here clearly stands for the Lord's coming. In David, </p>
<blockquote>
Your people are free-will offerings, in the day of Your power, in the beauties of holiness, 
from the womb of the dawn You have the dew of Your nativity. <a href="http://bible.gospelcom.net/cgi-bin/bible?passage=Ps%20110:%203&amp;version=ESV&amp;interface=print&amp;showfn=yes&amp;showxref">Ps 110: 3</a>. 
</blockquote>
<p>The whole of this psalm refers to the Lord and His victories in temptations, which are meant by 'the day of power and the 
beauties of His holiness'. 'From the womb of the dawn' means Himself, thus the Divine Love from which He fought. </p>
<p></p>
<p><b>[5]</b>
 In Zephaniah, </p>
<blockquote>
Jehovah is righteous in the midst of her. He will do no wrong. 
In the morning, in the morning He will bring His judgement to light. <a href="http://bible.gospelcom.net/cgi-bin/bible?passage=Zeph%203:%205&amp;version=ESV&amp;interface=print&amp;showfn=yes&amp;showxref">Zeph 3: 5</a>. 
</blockquote>
<p>'morning' stands for the time and the state when judgement takes place, which is the same as the Lord's coming, and 
this in turn is the same as the approach of His kingdom. </p>
<p></p>
<p><b>[6]</b>
 Since 'the morning' meant these things, Aaron and his sons, to provide the same representation, were commanded to set up a lamp and tend 
it from evening till morning before Jehovah, <a href="http://bible.gospelcom.net/cgi-bin/bible?passage=Exod%2027:%2021&amp;version=ESV&amp;interface=print&amp;showfn=yes&amp;showxref">Exod 27: 21</a>. The 'evening' referred to here is the twilight prior to morning, <a href="2323.htm">2323</a>. For a similar reason it was commanded that the fire on the altar was 
to be rekindled every dawn, <a href="http://bible.gospelcom.net/cgi-bin/bible?passage=Lev%206:%2012&amp;version=ESV&amp;interface=print&amp;showfn=yes&amp;showxref">Lev 6: 12</a>; also that none of the paschal lamb and the consecrated elements of sacrifices were to remain until the morning, <a href="http://bible.gospelcom.net/cgi-bin/bible?passage=Exod%2012:%2010;%2023:%2018;%2034:%2025&amp;version=ESV&amp;interface=print&amp;showfn=yes&amp;showxref">Exod 12: 10; 23: 18; 34: 25</a>; <a href="http://bible.gospelcom.net/cgi-bin/bible?passage=Lev%2022:%2029,%2030&amp;version=ESV&amp;interface=print&amp;showfn=yes&amp;showxref">Lev 22: 29, 30</a>; <a href="http://bible.gospelcom.net/cgi-bin/bible?passage=Num%209:%2012%20-&amp;version=ESV&amp;interface=print&amp;showfn=yes&amp;showxref">Num 9: 12 -</a> by which was meant that when the Lord came sacrifices would come to an end. </p>
<p></p>
<p><b>[7]</b>
 In a general sense 'morning' is used to describe both the time when dawn breaks and the time when the sun 
rises. 'morning' in this case stands for judgement in regard to the good as well as on the evil, as in the present chapter - 'The sun had gone forth over the earth and Lot came to Zoar; and Jehovah rained 
on Sodom and Gomorrah brimstone and fire', verses 23, 24. It in like manner stands for judgement on the evil, in David, </p>
<blockquote>
In the mornings I will destroy all the wicked of the land, to cut off from 
the city of Jehovah all workers of iniquity. <a href="http://bible.gospelcom.net/cgi-bin/bible?passage=Ps%20101:%208&amp;version=ESV&amp;interface=print&amp;showfn=yes&amp;showxref">Ps 101: 8</a>. 
</blockquote>
<p>And in Jeremiah, </p>
<blockquote>
Let that man be like the cities which Jehovah overthrew, and He does not repent; and let him hear a cry in the morning. 
<a href="http://bible.gospelcom.net/cgi-bin/bible?passage=Jer%2020:%2016&amp;version=ESV&amp;interface=print&amp;showfn=yes&amp;showxref">Jer 20: 16</a>. 
</blockquote>
<p></p>
<p><b>[8]</b>
 Seeing that 'the morning' in the proper sense means the Lord, His coming, and so the approach of His kingdom, what else is meant by 'the morning' becomes clear, namely the rise 
of a new Church, for that Church is the Lord's kingdom on earth. That kingdom is meant both in a general and in a particular sense, and indeed in a specific sense, the general being when any Church on 
earth is established anew; the particular, when a person is being regenerated and becoming a new man, for the Lord's kingdom is in that case being established in him and he is becoming the Church; and 
the specific, as often as good flowing from love and faith is at work with him, for this is what constitutes the Lord's coming. Consequently the Lord's resurrection on the third morning, <a href="http://bible.gospelcom.net/cgi-bin/bible?passage=Mark%2016:%202&amp;version=ESV&amp;interface=print&amp;showfn=yes&amp;showxref">Mark 16: 2</a>, 
<a href="9.htm">9</a>; <a href="http://bible.gospelcom.net/cgi-bin/bible?passage=Luke%2024:%201&amp;version=ESV&amp;interface=print&amp;showfn=yes&amp;showxref">Luke 24: 1</a>; <a href="http://bible.gospelcom.net/cgi-bin/bible?passage=John%2020:-1,%20e&amp;version=ESV&amp;interface=print&amp;showfn=yes&amp;showxref">John 20:-1, e</a>mbodies in the particular and the specific senses the truth that He rises daily, indeed every single moment, in the minds of regenerate persons. </p>

boni a malis, ut hic Lotus a viris Sodomae, ac postquam boni separati sunt, intereunt mali.  [4] Quod adventus Domini seu appropinquatio regni Ipsius non comparetur mane, sed dicatur mane, apud 
Danielem, 	Dixit unus sanctus, Quousque visio, juge, et praevaricatio vastans? Dixit ad me, Usque ad vesperam mane, bis mille trecenta, et justificabitur Sanctus.... Visio vesperae et mane, quae dicta, 
veritas est, viii 13, 14, 26; </p>
<p>`mane' hic manifeste pro adventu Domini: in apud Davidem, 	Populus tuus spontaneorum, in die fortitudinis tuae, in honoribus sanctitatis, ab utero ex aurora tibi ros 
	nativitatis tuae: Ps. cx (x)3 ubi in toto psalmo de Domino, et de victoriis Ipsius in tentationibus, quae sunt `dies fortitudinis, et honores sanctitatis Ipsius'; `ab utero ex aurora' est Ipse, ita 
Divinus Amor ex quo pugnavit(n): [5] apud Zephaniam, 	Jehovah justus in medio ejus, non faciet perversitatem, in mane, in mane judicium [Suum] dabit in lucem, iii 5; </p>
<p>`mane' pro tempore et statu judicii, 
quod est idem cum adventu Domini, et hoc idem cum appropinquatione regni Ipsius.  [6] Quia `mane' illa significabat, ut idem repraesentaretur, mandatum est, 	Ut Aharon et filii ejus ascendere 
facerent lucernam,...   	et disponerent a vespera usque ad mane coram Jehovah, Exod. 	xxvii 21; </p>
<p>`vespera' ibi est diluculum ante mane, n. 2323 similiter 	Quod ignis super altari accenderetur singulis 
auroris, Lev. vi 5: </p>
<p>tum quoque 	Quod de pecude paschali, et de sanctificatis sacrificiorum nihil relinqueretur ad mane, Exod xii 10; xxiii 18; xxxiv 25; Lev. xxii 29, 30; Num. ix 12; </p>
<p>quo significatum, 
quod cum veniret Dominus, sacrificia cessarent. [7] (m)In communi sensu mane dicitur, tam cum aurora apparet quam cum sol exoritur, et tunc accipitur `mane' pro judicio tam de bonis quam super malis, 
sicut in hoc capite, `Sol egressus super terram, et Lot venit Zoarem: et Jehovah pluere fecit super Sodomam et Amoram sulphur et ignem,' vers. 23, 24; similiter pro judicio super malis,(n) apud 
Davidem, 	In matutinis perdam omnes impios terrae, ad exscindendum ex urbe Jehovae omnes operantes iniquitatem, Ps. ci, 8: </p>
<p>et apud Jeremiam, 	Vir iste, sicut urbes quas evertit Jehovah, et non paenitet 
Ipsum, et audiat clamorem in mane, xx 16. [8] Quia `mane' in proprio sensu significat Dominum, Ipsius adventum, ita regni Ipsius appropinquationem, constare potest quid mane praeterea significat, 
nempe {5} exortum novae Ecclesiae, nam haec est regnum Domini in terris, et hoc tam in communi quam in particulari, immo etiam in singulari; in communi, quando exsuscitatur e novo aliqua Ecclesia in 
orbe; in particulari, quando regeneratur homo, et fit novus, nam tunc in illo exoritur regnum Domini, et ille fit Ecclesia; in singulari, quoties apud eum operatur bonum amoris et fidei, nam in hoc est 
Domini adventus: inde resurrectio Domini die tertio mane, Marc. xvi 2, 9; Luc. (x)xxiv 1; Joh. (x)xx 1, omnia illa involvit etiam in particulari et singulari, quod in mentibus regeneratorum quotidie; 
immo singulis momentis, resurgat. 	@3 i de qua sequitur$ 	@2 ab.$ 	@3 i foras.$ 	@4 eos I.$ 	@5 i quod.$ </p>
