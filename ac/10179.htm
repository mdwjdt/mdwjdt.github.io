<h3 align="center" class="ired">属天的奥秘 第10179节</h3>
<h4 align="center"></h4><p><strong>10179</strong>.“这坛要长一肘，宽一肘”表由良善和真理同等构成。这从“长”和“宽”的含义清楚可知：“长”是指良善，“宽”是指真理（参看<a href="1613.htm">1613</a>，<a href="3433.htm">3433</a>，<a href="3434.htm">3434</a>，<a href="4482.htm">4482</a>，<a href="9487.htm">9487</a>节）。由这二者同等构成由“长一肘，宽一肘”，因而由它们具有同等的尺寸来表示；因为在圣言中，尺寸用来具体确定事物的量和质，这种确定通过数字实现。在此由“一肘”的尺寸来确定的事物是良善与真理，良善由“长”来表示，真理由“宽”来表示。“长”之所以表示良善，是因为长是从东到西测量的，而“东和西”表示从一个边界到另一个边界的良善；而宽是从南到北测量的，“南和北”表示从一个边界到另一个边界的真理。在天堂里就是这种情况。在那里，主是太阳，也是东方，是那里确定一切方位所依据的点。那些面向太阳生活的人享有照着他们距离太阳的远近而享有对良善的感知；对良善具有清晰感知的人在东方（<a href="3708.htm">3708</a>，<a href="9668.htm">9668</a>节），对良善具有模糊感知的人在西方（<a href="3708.htm">3708</a>，<a href="9653.htm">9653</a>节）。然而，那些在清晰的真理之光中看东西的人在南方（<a href="9642.htm">9642</a>节），而那些在模糊的真理之光中看东西的人在北方（<a href="3708.htm">3708</a>节）。正因如此，在圣言中，这类事物由这四个方位来表示；“长”表示良善，“宽”表示真理。</p>

A cubit the length thereof, and a cubit the breadth thereof. That this signifies equally from good and from truth, is evident from the signification of "length" as being good, and of "breadth," as being 
truth (see n. 1613, 3433, 3434, 4482, 9487); equally from both is signified by "the length a cubit, and the breadth a cubit," thus by the measure being equal, because by measures in the Word things 
are determined in respect to their quantity and quality, and the determination is effected by means of numbers. The thing that is here determined by the measure, which is a "cubit," is good and truth; 
the former by the "length," and the latter by the "breadth." That "length" denotes good is because it is reckoned from east to west, and by "east and west" is signified good from one boundary to another; 
and breadth is reckoned from south to north, and by "south and north" is signified truth from one boundary to another. For such is the case in heaven, where the Lord is the Sun, and also the East, 
from which all determinations are there made. They who are in the front there are in the perception of good according to the distance; they who are in clear perception of good are in the east (n. 
3708, 9668), and they who are in obscure perception of good are in the west (n. 3708, 9653); but they who are in the clear light of truth are in the south (n. 9642), and they who are in the obscure light 
of truth are in the north (n. 3708). Hence it is that in the Word such things are signified by these four quarters; and that by "length" is signified good, and by "breadth" truth. </p>

'A cubit shall be its length, and a cubit its breadth' means consisting equally of good and of truth. This is clear from the meaning of 'length' as good, and of 'breadth' as truth, dealt with in <a href="1613.htm">1613</a>, <a href="3433.htm">3433</a>, <a href="3434.htm">3434</a>, <a href="4482.htm">4482</a>, <a href="9487.htm">9487</a>. Consisting of the two equally is meant by the fact that the length was a cubit and the breadth a cubit, thus by the fact that they were of equal measure; for in the Word measures 
are used to specify the amount and essential nature of a reality, and numbers are used in the specification. The reality specified by the measure here - a cubit - is good and truth, the former being 
meant by 'length' and the latter by 'breadth'. The reason why good is meant by 'length' is that the length is measured from east to west, and good from one boundary to the other is meant by 'east 
and west', whereas the breadth is measured from south to north, and truth from one boundary to the other is meant by 'south and north'. The same holds true in heaven. There the Lord is the Sun and also 
the East, the point from which every position there is determined. Those who live before the face of the sun enjoy a perception of good in the measure that they are near or far from it. Those with a 
clear perception of good are in the east, <a href="3708.htm">3708</a>, <a href="9668.htm">9668</a>, while those with a dim perception of good are in the west, <a href="3708.htm">3708</a>, <a href="9653.htm">9653</a>. Those however who see things in the clear light of truth are in the south, 
<a href="9642.htm">9642</a>, whereas those who see them in the dim light of truth are in the north, <a href="3708.htm">3708</a>. So it is that such things are meant in the Word by those four quarters, and that good is meant by 'length', and truth 
by 'breadth'.  </p>

`Cubitus longitudo ejus, et cubitus latitudo ejus': quod significet aequum ex bono et ex vero, constat ex significatione `longitudinis' quod sit bonum, et `latitudinis' quod sit verum, de qua n. 1613, 
3433, 3434, 4482, 9487; aequum ex utroque significatur per quod cubitus illa et cubitus haec, ita (o)per quod aequalis mensura, quia per mensuras in Verbo determinatur res {1} quoad suum quantum et 
quale, et determinatio fit per numeros; res quae hic per mensuram, quae est cubitus, determinatur, est bonum et verum, (c)illud per longitudinem, et hoc per latitudinem; quod longitudo sit bonum, est 
quia illa censetur ab oriente ad occidentem, et per orientem et occidentem significatur bonum ab uno termino ad alterum; ac latitudo a meridie ad septentrionem, et per meridiem et septentrionem significatur 
verum ab uno termino ad alterum; ita enim se habet in caelo, ubi Dominus est Sol (o)et quoque Oriens, a quo omnes determinationes ibi {2}; qui a facie ibi sunt, in perceptione boni sunt secundum 
distantiam, qui in perceptione boni clara sunt, in oriente sunt, (o)n. 3708, 9668, qui in perceptione boni obscura, in occidente sunt, (o)n. 3708, 9653, qui autem in luce veri clara sunt, in meridie 
sunt, (o)n. 9642, qui autem in luce veri obscura sunt, in septentrione sunt, (o)n. 3708; inde est quod per quattuor illas plagas in Verbo talia significentur, et quod per `longitudinem' bonum, (c)et 
per `latitudinem' verum. @1 i quae mensuratur$ @2 ita quoque oriens$ </p>
