<h3 align="center" class="ired">属天的奥秘 第148节</h3>
<h4 align="center"></h4><p><strong>148.</strong>人所珍视的自我被称为胸间的一条“肋骨”，这是因为，对于上古之人，“胸膛”象征仁爱，因为它包裹着心与肺；“骨头”象征无价值之物，因为它少有生气，“肉”则象征有生气之物。这些象征的根源是上古教会所知的一大奥秘，因主的慈悲，后文会加以相应的阐述。</p>

<p><strong>[NCE]148.</strong> Our identity or independence — which is indeed our own and is therefore tenderly loved by us — was called a rib or chest bone because to the earliest people the chest, with its heart and lungs, symbolized our tender love for others. Since bones are only minimally alive, they symbolized attributes of relatively little value. Flesh, however, symbolized attributes that have a living quality.<br />The reason for these symbolisms lies deeply hidden but was known to the earliest people. It will, with the Lord's divine mercy, be discussed later.{*1} <br /><strong>Footnotes:</strong><br />{*1} Swedenborg discusses the correspondence of bone in <a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_148/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_5560" target=_top>5560-5563</a>, and the first part of that passage, <a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_148/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_5560" target=_top>5560-5561</a>, may have been the kind of treatment he had in mind in promising to talk about the reason for the symbolism. But see also <a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_148/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_155" target=_top>155</a> just below. [LHC] </p>
<p align="center"><b>Potts(1905-1910) 148</b></p><p><b>148.</b>
The reason why what is man's own (and indeed an Own which is dear to him) is called a "rib" which is a bone of the chest, is that among the most ancient people the chest signified charity, because it 
contains both the heart and the lungs; and bones signified the viler things, because they possess a minimum of vitality; while flesh denoted such as had vitality. The ground of these significations is 
one of the deepest arcana known to the men of the most Ancient Church, concerning which of the Lord's Divine mercy hereafter. </p>

<p align="center"><b>Elliott(1983-1999) 148</b></p><p><b>148.</b>
The reason man's proprium - a proprium indeed that he cherishes - is called a rib, which is a breast bone, is that among the most ancient people the breast meant charity, for it has the heart and lungs 
within it, and bones meant those things that were less valuable because they contain only a very small amount of life. 'Flesh' however meant that which did possess some life. The reason why they had 
this meaning is a very deep arcanum known to the most ancient people, which will in the Lord's Divine mercy be dealt with later on.  </p>

<p align="center"><b>Latin(1748-1756) 148</b>
</p><b>148.</b>
Quod proprium hominis dictum costa quae est os pectoris, et quidem proprium quod ei carum, causa est quia 'pectus' apud antiquissimos significavit charitatem, quia ibi cor et pulmones: et 'ossa' significarunt 
ea quae viliora essent, quia iis minimum vitale inest; 'caro' autem, quae aliquid vitale haberent: quod ita significata sint, causa est arcanissima antiquissimis nota; de qua, ex Divina Domini 
Misericordia, in sequentibus. </p>
