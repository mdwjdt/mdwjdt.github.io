<h3 align="center" class="ired">属天的奥秘 第3776节</h3>
<h4 align="center"></h4><p><strong>3776.</strong>“弟兄们，你们是哪里来的”表那里仁爱的来源是什么？这从“弟兄”的“你们是哪里来的”的含义清楚可知：“弟兄”是指那些处于良善的人，因此是指良善本身，故而指仁爱（参看<a href="367.htm">367</a>，<a href="2360.htm">2360</a>，<a href="3303.htm">3303</a>，<a href="3459.htm">3459</a>节）；“你们是哪里来的”是指来源是什么？所有这一切表明，凡字义上包含一个问题并涉及人物的事在内义上会落入一个与任何人物无关的观念中。因为在天上的天使当中，字面上的历史在离开人进入天堂时就消失不见了。因此，雅各向哈兰人提出的这个问题，即“弟兄们，你们是哪里来的”表示那里仁爱的来源是什么？<br />此中情形如下：外在形式上看似仁爱的仁爱在内在形式上并不一定就是仁爱。通过目的可识别它是哪种仁爱，以及源于哪里。源于一个自私或世俗目的的仁爱就其内在形式而言，并不是仁爱，也不应该被称作仁爱。但源于邻舍、大众利益、天堂、因而主的仁爱就目的而言，才是真正的仁爱，并含有对发自内心行善的情感，因此含有生命的快乐，这种快乐在来世会变成幸福。人若要知道主的国度本身什么样，知道这一切至关重要。关于仁爱，或也可说，关于这良善的调查就是现在这几节所论述的主题。此处首先提出这个问题，即那里仁爱的来源是什么，这个问题由“弟兄们，你们是哪里来的”来表示。</p>

My brethren whence are ye? That this signifies, What is the origin of the charity? is evident from the signification of "brethren," as being those who are in good, and thence as being good itself, consequently 
charity (see n. 367, 2360, 3303, 3459); and from the signification of "whence are ye?" as being from what origin is it? All this shows that whatever in the sense of the letter involves a question 
and is determined to persons, in the internal sense falls into an idea undetermined to any person; for in heaven among the angels the historicals of the letter vanish when they leave man and enter 
heaven; so that Jacob's question to the men of Haran, "My brethren whence are ye?" signifies charity there, from what origin is it? [2] The case herein is as follows: The charity the external form 
of which appears as charity is not always charity in the internal form. Its quality and its source are known from its end. The charity that comes from a selfish or worldly end in its internal form is 
not charity, neither ought it to be called charity; but the charity that regards as its end the neighbor, the general good, heaven, and thus the Lord, is real charity, and has within it the affection 
of doing good from the heart, and the derivative delight of life which in the other life becomes bliss. It is of the utmost importance to know this, in order that man may know what the Lord's kingdom 
is in itself. Inquiry concerning this charity, or what is the same thing, concerning this good, is now treated of in these verses; and here it is first asked from what origin was the charity there; 
which is signified by, "My brethren whence are ye?" </p>

<p align="center"><b>Elliott(1983-1999) 3776</b></p><p><b>3776.</b>
'My brothers, where are you from?' means, What is the origin of the charity there? This is clear from the meaning of 'brothers' as people governed by good, and consequently as good itself and therefore 
as charity, dealt with in <a href="367.htm">367</a>, <a href="2360.htm">2360</a>, <a href="3303.htm">3303</a>, <a href="3459.htm">3459</a>, and from the meaning of 'Where are you from?' as, What is the origin? From these considerations it is also evident that the matters which in the sense 
of the letter are expressed as a question and have reference to persons fall in the internal sense into a mental image which has no reference to any person. For when the historical descriptions that 
belong to the letter leave man and pass into heaven they cease to be anything among the angels in heaven. From this it is clear that Jacob's question addressed to the men of Haran, 'My brothers, where 
are you from?' means, What is the origin of the charity there? The implications of this are that charity which looks like charity in outward appearance is not always charity inwardly. It is from the 
end in view that one recognizes which kind of charity it is and where it originates. Charity which springs from a selfish or a worldly end in view is not charity inwardly. Nor indeed ought it to be 
called charity. But charity which springs from the neighbour, the common good, heaven, and so the Lord, as the end in view is charity itself and contains the affection for doing good from the heart, and 
therefore contains the delight of life, which in the next life becomes a blessed delight. It is highly important for a person to know this if he is to know what the Lord's kingdom is within himself. 
Inquiry concerning this charity, or what amounts to the same, concerning this good, is the subject in the present verses. And the question is first put here, What is the origin of the charity there? 
meant by the question, 'My brothers, where are you from?' </p>

`Fratres mei, unde vos?': quod significet charitatem ibi ex qua origine, constat ex significatione `fratrum' quod sint illi qui in bono, et inde quod sit ipsum bonum, proinde charitas, de qua n. 367, 
2360, 3303, 3459; et ex significatione `unde vos' quod sit ex qua origine.  Ex his quoque patet, {1} quod quae in sensu litterae sunt interrogationis, et quod determinatum ad personas, in sensu interno 
in ideam indeterminatam {2} ad aliquem cadant; historica enim litterae nulla fiunt in caelo apud angelos cum relinquunt hominem, et intrant caelum; inde constare potest quomodo se habet cum 
interrogatione Jacobi ad viros Haranis, `Fratres mei, unde vos?' quod significet charitatem ibi ex qua origine. (s)Cum his ita se habet: charitas quae externa forma sicut charitas apparet, non semper 
est charitas in forma interna; ex fine cognoscitur qualis est et unde est; charitas quae ex fine {3} fit propter se aut propter mundum, non est charitas in forma interna, immo nec dicenda est 
charitas; at charitas quae ex fine fit {3} propter proximum, propter commune bonum, propter caelum, ac ita propter Dominum, est ipsa charitas, et habet in se affectionem benefaciendi ex corde, et inde 
jucundum vitae, quod in altera vita beatum fit: hoc scire maxime interest, ut homo sciat quid regnum Domini in se: de inquisitione de hac charitate, seu quod idem, de hoc bono, in his versibus 
nunc agitur; et hic primum quaeritur ex qua origine charitas, quod significatur per `fratres mei, unde vos?'(s) @1 i quomodo se habet cum sensu interno$ @2 A alters to non determinatam$ @3 est$ </p>
