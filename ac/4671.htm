<h3 align="center" class="ired">属天的奥秘 第4671节</h3>
<h4 align="center"></h4><p><strong>4671.</strong>“与他哥哥们一同牧羊”表它存在于那些具有信仰并教导人的人当中。这从“牧羊”的含义清楚可知，“牧羊”是指教导，尤其从教义事物教导那些在教会里的人。因为牧养羊群的人，或“牧人”表示教导人的人（参看<a href="343.htm">343</a>，<a href="3772.htm">3772</a>，<a href="3795.htm">3795</a>节）。在此表示它存在于那些教导人的人当中，因为经上说“约瑟与他哥哥们一同牧羊”；事实上，在本章，他哥哥代表从仁爱转向信仰，最终转向与仁分离之信，从而转向虚假的教会，这一点从下文明显看出来。</p>

Was feeding the flock with his brethren. That this signifies that it was present with those who were in faith and taught, is evident from the signification of "feeding the flock," as being to teach, 
specifically from doctrinal things, those who are in the church. (That a feeder of the flock or "shepherd" denotes one who teaches may be seen above, n. 343, 3772, 3795.) Here is signified that it was 
present with those who taught, because it is said that "Joseph was feeding with his brethren;" for his brethren in this chapter represent the church which turns away from charity to faith, and at last 
to faith separate, and so to falsities, as will appear in what follows. </p>

<p align="center"><b>Elliott(1983-1999) 4671</b></p><p><b>4671.</b>
'Was pasturing the flock with his brothers' means its presence among those governed by faith who were teachers. This is clear from the meaning of 'pasturing the flock' as teaching those within the Church, 
in particular from matters of doctrine. For one who pastures the flock, or a shepherd, means one who teaches, see <a href="343.htm">343</a>, <a href="3772.htm">3772</a>, <a href="3795.htm">3795</a>. In this case the meaning is presence among those who taught, because 
the words 'pasturing the flock with his brothers' are used - Joseph's brothers in this chapter representing the Church which turned aside from charity to faith, and at length to faith separated 
from charity and so to falsities, as will be evident in what follows below. </p>

`Fuit pascens cum fratribus suis gregem': quod significet quod interesset illis qui in fide essent qui docebant, constat ex significatione `pascere gregem' quod sit docere, {1} in specie ex doctrinalibus, 
illos qui in Ecclesia sunt; quod `pascens gregem' seu pastor sit qui docet, videatur n. 343, 3772, 3795, hic quod interesset illis qui docebant, quia dicitur `pascens cum fratribus'; fratres 
enim ejus in hoc capite repraesentant Ecclesiam quae deflectit a charitate ad fidem et tandem ad fidem separatam et sic ad falsa, ut patebit in {2} sequentibus.      @1 i et$      @2 a$ </p>
