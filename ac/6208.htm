<h3 align="center" class="ired">属天的奥秘 第6208节</h3>
<h4 align="center"></h4><p><strong>6208.</strong>有相当多的人具有遗传的属世良善，他们因此而以向他人行善为快乐。但是，他们并没有从圣言、教会的教义，或他们的宗教信仰接受行善的原则，故无法被赋予任何良知，因为良知并非来自属世或遗传的良善，而是来自关于真理与良善的教义和照之的生活。当这种人进入来世时，他们惊讶地发现，他们没有被接入天堂。他们说，他们一直过着良善的生活；但被告知，来自属世或遗传意向的良善生活不是一种良善生活；相反，良善的生活出自关于良善与真理的教义和基于教义的生活。他们被告知，通过这些教义和生活，人们拥有铭刻在他们身上的关于真理与良善的原则，并接受一种良知；良知就是天堂所流入的那个层面。为叫这些人知道这是事实，他们被送到各种不同的社群，在那里仅仅通过推理和由此产生的谬念，即：邪恶是良善，良善是邪恶，就受到迷惑，陷入各种邪恶。他们就这样在所到之处被这些论据左右，像风中的稻草那样被卷走。因为他们缺乏原则，没有天使能进入其中运作，把他们引离邪恶的那个层面。</p>

There are many who enjoy an hereditary natural good, by virtue of which they feel delight in doing well to others, but who have not been imbued with principles of doing what is good, either from the 
Word, the doctrine of the church, or from their religiosity. Thus they could not be endowed with any conscience, for conscience does not come from natural or hereditary good, but from the doctrine of 
truth and good and a life in accordance therewith. When such persons come into the other life, they marvel that they are not received into heaven, saying that they have led a good life. But they are told 
that a good life from what is natural or hereditary is not a good life, but that a good life is from those things which belong to the doctrine of good and truth and the consequent life; for by means 
of these, men have principles impressed on them that concern what is true and good, and they receive conscience, which is the plane into which heaven flows. In order that such persons may know that 
this is the case, they are sent into various societies, and they then suffer themselves to be led astray into evils of every kind, by mere reasonings and the derivative persuasions that evils are goods 
and goods evils, and in this way they are persuaded in every direction, and are carried away like chaff before the wind; for they are devoid of principles, and also of a plane into which the angels 
may operate and withdraw them from evils. </p>

There are quite a number of people who are endowed by heredity with natural good, as a result of which they delight in doing good to others. But since they have not adopted from the Word, from the teaching 
of the Church, or from the religion they belong to, any principles about the doing of good on account of those teachings, they have also been unable to have any conscience conferred on them; for 
conscience is not the product of natural or hereditary good but of teaching regarding what is true and good and of a life based on that teaching. When people like these come into the next life they 
are amazed that they are not received into heaven. They say they have led a good life, but they are told that a good life which is the outcome of natural or hereditary disposition is not a good life; 
it comes instead out of teaching regarding what is good and true and out of a life based on that teaching. Through such teaching and life, they are told, people have principles stamped on their character 
regarding what is true and good and receive a conscience, which is the base laid down for heaven to flow into. So that those who are told these things may know they are true, they are sent to different 
communities, where they allow themselves to be misled into all kinds of evil solely through reasonings and consequent false persuasions that things which are evil are good, and those which are good 
are evil. They are thus swayed by those arguments wherever they go and are borne around like straws in the wind. For they have no principles, no base laid down into which the angels can operate and 
guide them away from the wicked. </p>

</p><b>6208.</b>
Sunt plures qui gaudent bono naturali ex hereditario, ex quo jucundum habent in benefaciendo aliis, sed non ex Verbo aut doctrina Ecclesiae aut ex suo religioso imbuti principiis inde faciendi bonum, 
ita nec donari potuerunt aliqua conscientia, nam haec non venit ex bono naturali aut hereditario, sed ex doctrina veri et boni, et vita secundum illam; tales cum in alteram vitam veniunt, mirantur quod 
in caelum non recipiantur, dicentes quod vitam bonam egerint, sed illis dicitur quod vita bona ex naturali seu hereditario non sit vita bona, sed ex illis quae sunt doctrinae boni et veri ac inde 
vitae; per haec principia habent sibi impressa de vero et bono, et accipiunt conscientiam, quae planum est in quod influat caelum.  Ut sciant quod ita se res habeat, mittuntur in societates varias, et 
tunc patiuntur se abduci in quaecumque mala solum per ratiocinationes et inde persuasiones quod mala sint bona et bona sint mala, et sic persuadentur ubivis et (x)feruntur sicut paleae in vento; nam 
absque principiis sunt et absque plano in quod angeli operentur et a malis illos abducant. </p>
