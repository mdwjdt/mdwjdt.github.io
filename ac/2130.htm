<h3 align="center" class="ired">属天的奥秘 第2130节</h3>
<h4 align="center"></h4><p><strong>2130.</strong>关于第二种代表物，即当善人被准许进入天堂时，诸如在他们面前所进行的最后审判的概念，我讲述一下它的情况：在圣言中，经上说门就关了，她们不再被准许进入；因为她们没有油，并且来得太迟了，故不可进入；这些事也表示最后审判的状态。我也被指示这些事是怎么回事，以及该如何来理解。<br />我听见灵人社群一个接着一个以清晰的声音宣称，狼想掳走他们，但主解救了他们，所以他们归回主那里，并由此从内心深处欢喜雀跃。因为他们曾陷入绝望，因而极其害怕：门已关闭，并且他们因来得太迟而不得进入。这种想法就是那些被称为“狼群”之人给他们灌输的，不过，一旦他们被准许进入，也就是说，被天使社群接纳，这种想法就消失不见了，因为准许进入天堂不是别的。我曾见证过这种准许，它好像逐个社群不断行进，直到第十二个社群，并且准许，即接纳第十二个社群要比接纳之前的那十一个更困难。后来，又附加了八个社群，我被告知，它们全由女性组成。见证了所有这一切后，我被告知，这种准许，即接纳进入天堂社群的过程就呈现为这种形像，这一过程会不断依次从一个地方进行到另一个地方。我还被告知，天堂永远不会填满，那门更不会关闭；相反，进入的人越多，那些在天堂里的人就越幸福快乐，因为他们的和谐性会变得强大得多。<br />这些人被准许进入后，天堂仿佛关闭了。因为还有更多人渴望被准许进入，即被接纳。不过，他们得到的答复是，他们目前无法被接纳。这就是那些来得太迟的人、门关了、他们敲门、他们有灯无油所表示的。他们不可以进入，是因为他们尚未预备好能转移到相爱所在的天使社群。如前所述（<a href="2119.htm">2119</a>节末尾），在世时活在对邻之仁中的人逐步被主提入天堂。<br />还有一些灵人不知道何为天堂，即相爱，那时，他们也渴望被准许进入。他们以为这不过是准许的事。但他们得到的答复是，他们的时间还没有到。他们预备好后，会在另一个时间被准许进入。社群显现为十二的原因在于，“十二”表信的一切事物，如前所述（<a href="2129.htm">2129</a>节末尾）。</p>

In regard to the second subject, namely, the idea of a Last Judgment as presented to the good when they are being intromitted into heaven, I may relate how the case is. It is said in the Word that the 
door was shut, so that they could no longer be admitted; and that they had no oil, and came too late, and therefore were not admitted; by which things also there is signified the state of the Let Judgment. 
How these matters are and are to be understood, has been shown me.  [2] I heard societies of spirits, one after another, saying in a clear voice that the wolf had wanted to carry them off, but 
that the Lord rescued them, and that so they were restored to the Lord, in consequence of which they rejoiced from the inmost heart, for they had been in despair, and thus in fear, that the door had 
been shut, and that they had come too late to be admitted. Such thought had been infused into them by those who are called "wolves " but it vanished on their being admitted, that is, on their being received 
by angelic societies, for intromission into heaven is nothing else. The intromission was seen by me as though it were made and continued with one society after another up to twelve, and that the 
twelfth society was intromitted (that is, received) with more difficulty than the eleven that had preceded it. There were afterwards admitted eight additional quasi societies that I was told were of 
the female sex. When I had seen these things, it was said that this process of admission (that is, of reception) into the heavenly societies presents this appearance, and this continuously, in order, 
from one place to another; and also that heaven can never to eternity be filled, still less is the door shut; but the more there come thither, the more blessed and happy are those who are in heaven; 
because the harmoniousness is so much the stronger.  [3] After these had been admitted, it appeared as if heaven were shut; for there were a number more who desired to be intromitted (that is, received) 
next. But they were answered that they could not be received as yet; which is signified by those who came too late, by the door being shut, by their knocking, and by their lacking oil in their lamps. 
Their not being admitted was because they were not yet prepared to be capable of being among the angelic societies, where there is mutual love, for, as before said (n. 2119 at the end), they who 
in this world have lived in charity toward the neighbor are by degrees raised into heaven by the Lord.  [4] There were also other spirits who were ignorant of what heaven is, that it is mutual love, 
who also desired to be then admitted, supposing that admission is everything; but they were answered that it was not yet their time, but that they would be admitted at another time, when they were ready. 
The reason that the societies appeared to be twelve, was that by "twelve" are signified all things of the faith, as before said (n. 2129 at the end). </p>

As regards the second representation, that is to say, the idea of a Last Judgement which takes place before the eyes of the good when they are being admitted into heaven, let that too be described. In 
the Word it is said that the door was shut, so that they could no longer be admitted; and that they had no oil, arrived too late, and therefore were not admitted, statements which also mean a Last-Judgement 
state. The situation with these matters and how they are to be understood has been shown to me. </p>

<p><b>[2]</b>
 I heard communities of spirits declaring in a clear voice, one community after another, 
that a wolf had wished to carry them off but that the Lord rescued them, and so they were restored to Him, and on that account rejoiced from the depths of their heart. Indeed they had been without hope, 
and so were afraid that the door had been shut, and that they had arrived too late to be admitted. Such thought had been instilled into them by those called wolves, but it vanished on their being admitted, 
that is, being received, by angelic communities. Being admitted into heaven is nothing else. The admission which I witnessed seemed to proceed continuously community by community, up to twelve 
of them, the admission, that is, the reception, of the twelfth being more difficult than that of the previous eleven. After that about eight more communities were also admitted, which, it was pointed 
out to me, were composed of females. Having witnessed all this I was told that this is how the process of admission, that is, of being received into heavenly communities is seen. They proceed in an 
orderly continuation from one place to another. I was also told that heaven can never be filled up, still less the door be shut, but that the more who enter, the more blessing and happiness there is for 
those in heaven, because their unanimity is made that much stronger. </p>
<p></p>
<p><b>[3]</b>
 After these had been admitted it did at that point seem as though heaven was shut; for there were still more who wished after 
that to be admitted, that is, to be received. But they were told in reply that they could not yet be let in. This is meant by those arriving too late, by the door being shut, by their knocking, and 
by the statement about their having no oil in their lamps. The reason they were not admitted was that they were not yet ready to move among angelic communities where mutual love exists, for, as stated 
above towards the end of <a href="2119.htm">2119</a>, people who in the world have lived charitably disposed towards the neighbour are raised up by the Lord into heaven gradually. </p>
<p></p>
<p><b>[4]</b>
 There were also other spirits who 
did not know what heaven is, namely mutual love, and who also at that time wished to be admitted. They imagined it was just a matter of being admitted. They received the reply however that it was not 
yet time for them, but that they would be admitted at another time when they were ready for it. The reason why twelve communities were seen was that 'twelve' means everything comprising faith, as stated 
above towards the end of <a href="2129.htm">2129</a>. </p>

</p><b>2130.</b>
Quod alterum attinet, nempe ideam ultimi judicii coram bonis cum intromittuntur in caelum, quomodo se habet, licet referre: dicitur in Verbo quod clausa sit janua ut non amplius intromitti possint; 
et quod oleum defecerit, ac serius venerint, et ideo non admissi, per quae etiam status ultimi judicii significatur; quomodo haec se habent et quomodo intelligenda, mihi ostensum est.  [2] Audivi societates 
spirituum, unam post alteram, dicentes voce clara quod lupus voluisset eos auferre sed quod Dominus eripuerit eos, et sic quod restituti sint Domino, inde gavisi ex intimo corde; fuerunt enim in 
desperatione, ita in timore, quod clausa esset janua, et quod sero venissent ut non possent intromitti; talis cogitatio illis infusa fuit ab iis qui lupi vocantur, sed evanuit per id quod intromitterentur, 
hoc est, quod reciperentur a societatibus angelicis; intromissio in caelum non aliud est; intromissio visa mihi, quasi facta et continuata per societates usque ad duodecim, et quod duodecima aegrius 
quam undecim priores intromitteretur, hoc est, reciperetur; postea quoque admittebantur octo quasi societates quae quod fuerint ex sexu feminino, mihi indicatum est: quibus visis, dicebatur, quod 
hic processus admissionis, hoc est, receptionis, in societates caelestes ita appareat, et hoc continue, ordine ab uno loco in alterum; tum quod caelum nusquam in aeternum oppleatur, minus quod janua 
claudatur, sed quo plures eo veniunt, eo illis qui in caelo beatius et felicius, quia inde unanimum fortius.  [3] Postquam illi intromissi sunt, tunc apparebat {1} tanquam clauderetur caelum; erant 
enim plures qui dein etiam volebant intromitti, hoc est, recipi; sed responsum tulerunt quod non possent adhuc; quod significatur per `serius venientes,' per quod `janua clausa,' per `pulsantes' et per 
quod `oleum illis defecerit in lampadibus'; quod illi non admissi, erat ob causam quia nondum praeparati ut interesse possent societatibus angelicis ubi amor mutuus, nam ut supra n. 2119 ad finem dictum, 
qui in charitate erga proximum in mundo vixerunt, per gradus in caelum a Domino elevantur.  [4] Erant etiam alii spiritus, qui ignorabant quid caelum, quod sit amor mutuus, qui etiam tunc intromitti 
volebant putantes quod solum sit intromissio, sed responsum tulerunt quod iis nondum tempus, sed quod alio tempore, cum praeparati: quod duodecim societates apparuerint, erat causa quia `duodecim' 
significant omnia fidei, ut supra (o)n. 2129 ad finem dictum. 	@1 quasi.$ </p>
