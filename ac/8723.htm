Verses 24-27. And Moses hearkened to the voice of his father-in-law, and did all that he had said. And Moses chose men of strenuousness out of all Israel, and gave them as heads over the people: princes 
of thousands, princes of hundreds, princes of fifties, and princes of tens. And they shall judge the people in every time, the difficult word they shall bring unto Moses, and every small word they 
shall judge. And Moses let his father-in-law go, and he went to himself unto his own land.  "And Moses hearkened to the voice of his father-in-law, and did all that he had said," signifies the effect 
according to the setting in order of Divine good; "and Moses chose men of strenuousness out of all Israel," signifies the choice of truths with which good could be conjoined among those who were of 
the spiritual church; "and gave them as heads over the people," signifies influx into these truths; "princes of thousands, princes of hundreds, princes of fifties, and princes of tens," signifies primary 
truths that are subordinate in successive order to the truth proceeding immediately from the Divine; "and they shall judge the people in every time," signifies their consequent perpetual dependence; 
"the difficult word they shall bring unto Moses," signifies mediation and intercession; "and every small word they shall judge," signifies the appearance of some particular and singular things as from 
another source; "and Moses let his father-in-law go," signifies a state of truth Divine accommodated; "and he went to himself unto his own land," signifies to the Divine Itself. </p>

Verses 24-27 And Moses listened to the voice of his father-in-law, and did all that he said. And Moses chose men of vigour from all Israel, and made them heads over the people, rulers of thousands, rulers 
of hundreds, rulers of fifties, and rulers of tens. And they will judge the people at all times; a difficult matter they will bring to Moses, and every small matter they will judge themselves. And 
Moses sent his father-in-law away; and he went his way to his own land. </p>
<p>'And Moses listened to the voice of his father-in-law, and did all that he said' means that the arrangement ordained by Divine 
Good was put into effect. 'And Moses chose men of vigour from all Israel' means the choice of truths to which good could be joined among those belonging to the spiritual Church. 'And made them heads 
over the people' means influx into those truths. 'Rulers of thousands, rulers of hundreds, rulers of fifties, and rulers of tens' means successive levels of first and foremost truths below the truth 
coming forth directly from God. 'And they will judge the people at all times' means unceasing dependence on the level above. 'A difficult matter they will bring to Moses' means mediation and intercession. 
'And every small matter they will judge themselves' means the appearance that some particular and specific things derive from another source. 'And Moses sent his father-in-law away' means the 
fully adjusted state of God's truth. 'And he went his way to his own land' means to the Divine Himself. </p>

Vers. 24-27.  Et auscultavit Moscheh voci soceri sui, et fecit omne quod dixit.  Et elegit Moscheh viros strenuitatis ab omni Israele, et dedit illos capita super populum, principes millenorum, principes 
centenorum, principes quinquagenorum, et principes decadum.  Et judicabunt populum in omni tempore, verbum difficile adducent ad Moschen, et omne verbum parvum judicabunt illi.  Et dimisit Moscheh 
socerum suum, et ivit sibi ad terram suam.  `Et auscultavit Moscheh voci soceri sui, et fecit omne quod dixit' significat effectum secundum ordinationem Divini Boni: `et elegit Moscheh viros strenuitatis 
ab omni Israele' significat electionem verorum quibus bonum conjungi potuit apud illos qui ab Ecclesia spirituali: `et dedit illos capita super populum' significat influxum in illa vera: `principes 
millenorum, principes centenorum, principes quinquagenorum, et principes decadum' significat primaria vera quae subordinata in ordine successivo vero immediate a Divino procedenti: `et judicabunt 
populum in omni tempore' significat dependentiam inde perpetuam: `verbum difficile adducent ad Moschen' significat mediationem et intercessionem: et omne verbum parvum judicabunt illi' significat apparentiam 
quorundam particularium et singularium aliunde: `et dimisit Moscheh socerum suum' significat statum veri Divini accommodatum: `et ivit sibi ad terram suam' significat ad ipsum Divinum. </p>
