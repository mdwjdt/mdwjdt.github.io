<h4 align="center"></h4><p><strong>4603.</strong>“雅各的儿子共有十二个”表现存在于神性属世层中的一切事物的状态。从“雅各”的代表和“十二”的含义清楚可知：“雅各”是指神性属世层，如前面频繁所述；“十二”是指全部，当论及雅各的儿子，或以他们命名的各支派时，是指真理与良善的全部事物（参看<a href="2089.htm">2089</a>，<a href="2129.htm">2129</a>，<a href="2130.htm">2130</a>，<a href="3272.htm">3272</a>，<a href="3858.htm">3858</a>，<a href="3913.htm">3913</a>，<a href="3939.htm">3939</a>节）。关于主的属世层，前面已说明，祂将自己里面的属世层变成神性，因为“雅各”一直代表这属世层。但此处论述的主题是神性属世层与神性理性层的联结，这种联结由雅各来到以撒那里来代表，因为“以撒”代表主的神性理性层。正因如此，雅各的所有儿子被重新列举了一遍，因为在这属世层与理性层充分联结之前，真理与良善的全部事物必须存在于属世层里面。特别列举他们的原因是，属世层作为接受理性层的容器而服务于理性层。不过，要知道，现在提及雅各儿子的顺序不同于以前；因为辟拉和悉帕的儿子，即但、拿弗他利、迦得和亚设最后被提及，尽管他们在以萨迦、西布伦、约瑟、便雅悯之前出生。这种不同的原因是，此处论述的是当这属世层变成神性时，真理与良善在属世层里面的次序；因为正在论述的主题的状态决定了提及他们的顺序（<a href="3862.htm">3862</a>，<a href="3926.htm">3926</a>，<a href="3939.htm">3939</a>节）。</p>

And the sons of Jacob were twelve. That this signifies the state of all things now in the Divine natural, is evident from the representation of Jacob, as being the Divine natural (of which often above); 
and from the signification of "twelve" as being all, and when predicated of the sons of Jacob or of the tribes named from them, as being all things of truth and good (see n. 2089, 2129, 2130, 3272, 
3858, 3913, 3939). As regards the Lord's natural it has been shown how He made it Divine in Himself, for this was represented by Jacob. But the subject here treated of is the conjunction of the Divine 
natural with the Divine rational, which conjunction is represented by Jacob's coming to Isaac, for Isaac represents the Lord's Divine rational. It is for this reason that all Jacob's sons are enumerated 
anew, for all things of truth and good must be in the natural before this could be fully conjoined with the rational, because the natural serves the rational as a receptacle, and therefore these 
are enumerated. Be it known, however, that the sons of Jacob are now named in an order different from that in which they were named before; for the sons of Bilhah and Zilpah, namely, Dan, Naphtali, Gad, 
and Asher, are in the last place, who nevertheless were born before Issachar, Zebulun, Joseph, and Benjamin. The reason of this is that the order of the truths and goods in the natural when this has 
been made Divine, is here treated of; for the order in which these are mentioned is in accordance with the state of the subject that is being treated of (n. 3862, 3926, 3939). </p>

'The sons of Jacob were twelve' means a state in which all things were now present in the Divine Natural. This is clear from the representation of 'Jacob' as the Divine Natural, often dealt with already; 
and from the meaning of 'twelve' as all, and when used in reference to the sons of Jacob, or to the tribes named after these, as all aspects of truth and good, dealt with in <a href="2089.htm">2089</a>, <a href="2129.htm">2129</a>, <a href="2130.htm">2130</a>, <a href="3272.htm">3272</a>, <a href="3858.htm">3858</a>, <a href="3913.htm">3913</a>, <a href="3939.htm">3939</a>. The subject so far has been the way in which the Lord made his Natural within Him Divine, for 'Jacob' has represented the Natural; but now the subject becomes the joining of the Divine 
Natural to the Rational. This joining together is represented by Jacob's coming to Isaac, for 'Isaac' represents the Lord's Divine Rational. This explains why all the sons of Jacob are listed once 
again, since every aspect of truth and good had to be present within the Natural before it could be fully joined to the Rational. The reason for this particular listing of them is the service which 
the natural renders the rational as the receptacle for it. But one should recognize that Jacob's sons are now mentioned in a different order from before; the sons of Bilhah and Zilpah - Dan, Naphtali, 
Gad, and Asher - are mentioned last, though in actual fact these were born before Issachar, Zebulun, Joseph, and Benjamin. The reason for this difference is that at this point the subject is the order 
in which truths and goods exist within the Natural when this has been made Divine, for it is the state belonging to the subject under discussion that determines the order in which their names appear,

`Fuerunt filii Jacobi duodecim': quod significet statum omnium nunc in Divino Naturali, constat a repraesentatione `Jacobi' quod sit Divinum Naturale, de qua saepius prius; et a significatione `duodecim' 
quod sint omnia, et cum duodecim praedicantur de filiis Jacobi, seu de tribubus ab illis nominatis, quod sint omnia veri et boni, de qua n. 2089 {1}, 2129, 2130, 3272, 3858, 3913, 3939.  Dictum 
{2} est de Naturali Domini quomodo Ipse illud in Se Divinum fecit, `Jacobus' enim illud repraesentavit, mox {3} autem agitur de conjunctione Divini Naturalis cum Rationali, quae (o)conjunctio 
repraesentatur per adventum Jacobi ad Jishakum {4}, Jishakus enim repraesentat Divinum Rationale Domini, inde est quod recenseantur denuo {5} omnes filii Jacobi; in naturali enim omnia veri et boni 
debuerunt esse antequam `plene' conjungi potuit cum rationali, quia naturale inservit rationali pro receptaculo, ideo recensitio illa {6}: sed sciendum quod filii jacobi nunc alio ordine quam prius 
nominentur, ultimo enim loco filii Bilhae et Zilpae, nempe Dan, Naphtali, Gad et Asher, qui tamen prius nati sunt quam Jisaschar, Zebulun, Joseph et Benjamin; causa est quia hic agitur de ordine 
in quo sunt vera et bona in Naturali cum hoc Divinum factum est, nam secundum statum rei de qua agitur, est ordo nominationis eorum, videatur n. 3862, 3926, 3939.      @1 i 577$      @2 Actum$
