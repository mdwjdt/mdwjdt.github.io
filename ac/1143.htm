<h3 align="center" class="ired">属天的奥秘 第1143节</h3>
<h4 align="center"></h4><p><strong>1143.</strong> 尽管这些是组成古教会的那些民族的名字，但在内义上，它们仍表具体事物，即敬拜的种类。在天堂，天使对名字、地区、民族及类似事物根本一无所知，他们对这类事物没有任何概念，只知道它们所代表的真实事物。主的圣言凭内义而活，内义就象灵魂，其身体可以说是字义。正如人的肉体死亡时，灵魂继续活着，而灵魂活着时，他便不再知道属乎肉体的事物。同样，当加入天使行列时，他不知道圣言的字义，仅知道它灵魂层面的东西。上古教会成员就是这样，他若活到今天，并且阅读圣言，根本就不会纠缠于字义，可以说看不到它，而只看到从文字抽象出来的内义。事实上，那文字仿佛不存在。所以，他会处于圣言的生命或灵魂中。圣言的每一部分都是这样，包括诸如完全是叙事型的历史部分。然而，就内义而言，其中的每一个字无不包含深邃的奥秘，而这些奥秘从未显示给那些头脑局限于历史之人。因此，本章出现的这些名字就字义或历史义而言，是指组成古教会的人民，但就内义而言，是指他们的教义。</p>

<p><strong>[NCE]1143.</strong> Despite the fact that these were the actual names of the nations that made up the ancient church, they mean something on an inner level — specifically, the types of worship themselves.<br />The inhabitants of heaven have no idea what the names, the lands, the nations, and so on are. No concept of such things exists there, only a concept of the entities they symbolize.<br />The inner meaning gives the Lord's Word life. That meaning is like a soul whose body is the superficial sense. The case resembles that with human beings; when our body dies — when we join the angels — our soul comes alive, and when our soul lives, we no longer know anything of bodily affairs. By the same token, we no longer know what the literal meaning of the Word is, only what its soul is.<br />[2] The people of the earliest church were like this, and if they were alive today and read the Word, they would not become bogged down in the literal meaning. It would be as if they did not see the letter but only the inner meaning apart from the letter. In fact it would be as if the letter did not exist. So they would fasten on to the life or soul of the Word.<br />This is the situation throughout the Word, including the historical parts, which report exactly what happened but contain not even one little word that does not enfold hidden meanings on an inner plane. These meanings are never seen by readers who train their attention on the historical context.<br />Likewise in the current chapter; in the literal sense or the narrative, the names mean the peoples that made up the ancient church, but in the inner sense they mean the doctrinal concepts of those peoples. </p>
<p align="center"><b>Potts(1905-1910) 1143</b></p><p><b>1143.</b>
Although these were the names of the nations that constituted the Ancient Church, yet in the internal sense they mean actual things [res], namely, the worships themselves. In heaven nothing at all is 
known about the names, countries, nations, and the like; the angels have no idea of such things, but of the actual things signified by them. The Word of the Lord is living by virtue of the internal sense. 
This is as the soul, of which the external sense is as the body. And just as with man when his body dies the soul lives, and when the soul lives he no longer knows the things that pertain to the 
body, so when he comes among angels he does not know what the Word is in the sense of the letter, but only what it is in its soul. Such was the man of the Most Ancient Church; who, if he were living 
and read the Word at the present day, would not cleave at all to the sense of the letter; but would be as if he did not see it, but only the internal sense abstractly from the letter; and indeed as if 
the letter had no existence. Thus he would be in the life or soul of the Word. It is the same everywhere in the Word, even in its historical parts, which were just such as are narrated, and yet there 
is not so much as one little word therein that does not, in the internal sense, enfold within it deep secrets which never appear to those who hold the mind in the historical connection. Thus in this 
chapter by the names, in the literal or historical sense, are meant the peoples that constituted the Ancient Church, but in the internal sense their doctrinals are signified. </p>

<p align="center"><b>Elliott(1983-1999) 1143</b></p><p><b>1143.</b>
Although these were the names of those nations that constituted the Ancient Church, they are nevertheless used in the internal sense to mean specific things, namely types of worship. As to what names, 
territories, nations, and similar things are, nothing at all is known in heaven. There they have no mental picture of such, only of the things meant by them It is by virtue of the internal sense that 
the Word of the Lord is living. That sense is like the soul, whose body so to speak is the external sense. And just as when someone's body dies the soul lives on, and when the soul lives on he is no 
longer aware of the things that belong to the body, so when he arrives among the angels he is not aware of what the Word is in the sense of the letter but of what it is in its soul. The member of the 
Most Ancient Church was such that if he were alive here today and read the Word he would not cling at all to the sense of the letter, but would so to speak not see it, only the internal sense abstractedly 
from the letter. Indeed it would be as though the letter did not exist, and so he would be abiding in the life or soul of the Word. This applies to every part of the Word, including historical descriptions 
of events that took place entirely as recorded. Even there not a single word exists which does not in the internal sense embody arcana, and these are never apparent to those who keep their 
mind on the historical connections. So in this chapter by the names used here are meant, in the sense of the letter or historical sense, the people who constituted the Ancient Church. In the internal 
sense however their matters of doctrine are meant </p>

</p><b>1143.</b>
Tametsi harum gentium quae Ecclesiam Antiquam constituerunt, haec nomina fuerunt, usque in sensu interno intelliguntur res, nempe ipsi cultus:  quid nomina, quid terrae, quid gentes, et similia, ne 
hilum norunt qui in caelo; talium ibi nulla idea est, sed rerum per illa significatarum:  ex sensu interno vivit Verbum Domini, est sicut anima cujus quasi corpus est sensus externus; seque habet sicut 
homo, cum corpus ejus moritur tunc vivit anima; et cum vivit anima tunc non amplius novit quae corporis sunt; ita cum inter angelos venit, nec quid Verbum in sensu litterae, sed quid in sua anima:  
homo Antiquissimae Ecclesiae talis fuit, qui si hodie viveret et legeret Verbum, ne hilum inhaereret sensui litterae, sed foret sicut illum non videret, modo sensum internum abstracte a littera, et quidem 
sicut littera non foret, sic in vita aut anima Verbi.  Similiter se habet ubivis in Verbo, etiam in historicis quae talia prorsus sunt sicut relata, sed usque ibi ne quidem una vocula datur quae 
non in sensu interno arcana involvit, quae nusquam apparent iis qui in contextu historico tenent animum.  Ita in hoc capite, per nomina hic significantur, in sensu litterae aut historico, populi qui Antiquam 
Ecclesiam constituerunt, in sensu autem interno doctrinalia illorum. </p>
