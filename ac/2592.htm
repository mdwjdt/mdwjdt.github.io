<h3 align="center" class="ired">属天的奥秘 第2592节</h3>
<h4 align="center"></h4><p><strong>2592.</strong>在我面前有一个人（可能是西塞罗），他以前属更有智慧者，因而在学术界享有盛名。我与他谈论了各种话题，因知道他是智者，便与其谈论智慧、聪明、秩序、圣言，最后谈到主。关于智慧，他说除了生活的智慧外，没有其它智慧，智慧不能属于其它。关于聪明，他说聪明源于智慧。关于秩序，他说秩序来自至高无上的神，照秩序生活就是智慧聪明。<br />关于圣言，我给他读先知书的一段，他听得入了迷，尤其陶醉于每个名、每个字皆指向内在事物。对于现代学者无此乐趣和追求，他感到十分诧异。我能清楚感觉到其思维或心智的内层已经打开，而与此同时，在场的某些基督徒的内层却已关闭，因为这些基督徒对他心怀恶意，并且不相信圣言具有这样的性质。当我继续读圣言时，他说他不能在场，因为对他来说，圣言太过神圣，使他无法承受，他的内在感动至此。而另一方面，一些基督徒却大声说，他们能在场；这是因为他们的内层已关闭，因此，神圣事物打动不了他们。<br />最后，我向他谈到主说，祂虽生而为人，却是从神成孕；祂脱去人性，披上神性；统治整个宇宙的，正是祂。对此，他的答复是，他了解许多关于主的事，并以自己的方式发觉：舍此途径，人类不能得救。在此期间，一些邪恶的基督徒各种发难，但他毫不在意。他说这不奇怪，因为他们在世时，曾在这些问题上吸收了不恰当的观念，若不拔除，就不能像本无所知的人那样承认确认真理的事。这个人就是一个外邦人。</p>

There was present with me a certain person* who was formerly among the more wise, and was thereby well known in the learned world. I conversed with him on various subjects, and as I knew that he had 
been a wise man, I spoke with him concerning wisdom, intelligence, order, the Word, and finally concerning the Lord. Concerning wisdom he said that there is no other wisdom than that which is of life, 
and that wisdom can be predicated of nothing else. Concerning intelligence he said that it was from wisdom. Concerning order he said that it is from the Supreme God, and that to live in that order is 
to be wise and intelligent. [2] As regards the Word, when I read to him something from the prophecies, he was very greatly delighted, especially from the fact that each of the names and each of the 
words signified interior things, wondering greatly that the learned of this day are not delighted with such a study. I plainly perceived that the interiors of his thought or mind had been opened, and 
at the same time that those of certain Christians who were present had been closed; for ill will against him prevailed with them, and also unbelief that the Word is of this nature. Nay, when I went on 
reading the Word he said that he could not be present, because he perceived it to be too holy for him to endure, so interiorly was he affected. The Christians on the other hand said aloud that they could 
be present; and this was because their interiors had been closed, and therefore the holy things did not affect them. [3] At length I talked with him about the Lord; that He was born a man, but was 
conceived of God; that He had put off the human and had put on the Divine; and that it is He who governs the universe. To this he made answer that he knew many things about the Lord, and had perceived 
in his own way that it could not have been done otherwise if the human race was to be saved. Meantime certain wicked Christians injected various difficulties, for which he did not care, saying that 
it was not surprising, because they had become imbued in the life of the body with unbecoming ideas respecting these things, and that until such ideas were dispersed they could not admit things confirmatory, 
as could those who are ignorant. This man was a Gentile. * Probably Cicero; see Heaven and Hell, n. 322. [REVISER.] </p>

Present with me there was a certain person who in the past had been one of those with more wisdom than others and was for that reason well-known in the learned world. I spoke to him on various subjects.<A name="fntext1"></a><A href="#fn1"><sup>a</sup></a> 
Knowing that he was a wise man I talked to him about wisdom, about intelligence, about order, about the Word, and finally about the Lord. Of wisdom he said that no other wisdom existed except that 
which had to do with life and that wisdom could not have reference to anything else. Of intelligence he said it had its origin in wisdom. Of order he said that order had its origin in the supreme God 
and that living within that order was being wise and intelligent. </p>
<p></p>
<p><b>[2]</b>
 As regards the Word, when I read to him something from the prophetical parts he was extremely delighted, above all with the fact 
that individual names and individual expressions meant things that were interior. He was utterly amazed that the learned nowadays take no delight in studying matters such as this. I perceived clearly 
that the interior parts of his thought or mind had been opened, and at the same time that those of certain Christians who were present had been closed, for with these Christians there reigned ill-will 
towards him and lack of belief that the Word was of such a nature. Indeed when I continued reading the Word he said that he could not remain because he perceived something more sacred than he could 
endure, being stirred inwardly by so much feeling. The Christians on the other hand said quite openly that they were able to remain; and the reason why they were able to do so was that their interiors 
had been closed and sacred things did not stir any such feelings within them. </p>
<p></p>
<p><b>[3]</b>
 At length I spoke to him about the Lord, that He was born a man but conceived from God, that He cast off the human 
and put on the Divine, and that it is He who rules over all. To these points he replied that he knew many things about the Lord, and in his own way recognized that if the human race was to be saved 
it could not have been done in any other way. During this time certain bad Christians were introducing various objections, but to these he paid no attention, saying that it was not surprising that they 
did so, for during their lifetime they had absorbed obnoxious ideas regarding these matters and that unlike the ignorant they could not admit things of a confirmatory nature until these ideas had 
been dispersed. This person had been a gentile.

Fuit apud me quidam qui olim inter sapientiores fuit, et quoque inde notus in orbe erudito, cum quo de variis locutus sum; et quia cognovi quod sapiens fuerat, sermo fuit cum illo de sapientia, de intelligentia, 
de ordine, de Verbo, et demum de Domino: de sapientia dixit, quod non alia sapientia detur quam quae est vitae, et quod de alia re sapientia praedicari nequeat: de intelligentia, quod illa 
sit inde: de ordine, quod ordo sit a supremo Deo, et quod vivere in illo ordine, sit sapiens et intelligens esse: [2] quod Verbum attinet, cum praelegerem illi aliquid ex Propheticis, delectatus est 
quam maxime, praecipue ex eo quod singula nomina et singulae voces significarent interiori miratus valde quod eruditi hodie non delectentur tali studio; percepi manifeste quod interiora ejus cogitationis 
seu mentis aperta essent, et tunc simul quibusdam Christianis qui aderant, clausa; regnabat enim apud hos invidia contra eum, et incredulitas quod Verbum esset tale; immo cum pergerem legere Verbum, 
dixit quod non adesse posset, quia sanctius perciperet quam ut possit sustinere, ita enim interius afficiebatur; contra autem Christiani dicebant aperta voce quod adesse possent, ex causa quia interiora 
iis clausa essent, et sancta eos non afficerent.  [3] Tandem fuit sermo cum illo de Domino quod natus sit homo sed conceptus a Deo, et quod exuerit humanum et induerit Divinum, et quod Ille sit 
Qui universum regit; ad haec respondit quod plura sciat de Domino, et appercepit suo modo quod non aliter fieri potuisset salvaretur genus humanum; interea quidam Christiani mali infundebant varia scandala, 
sed illa non curabat, dicens quod non mirum sit, quia imbuerunt in vita corporis de illis non talia sicut decet, et quod antequam talia discussa fuerint, non admittere possent illa quae confirmant, 
sicut ii qui ignorant {1}.  Hic fuerat gentilis. 	@1 ignorarunt.$ </p>
