<h4 align="center"></h4><p><strong>933.</strong>“冷与热”表正在重生之人的状态，在接受信和仁方面，他的状态类似于冷和热，“冷”表无信和仁，“热”表有信和仁。这一点从圣言中“冷和热”的含义清楚可知，这两个词要么用于要重生之人，要么用于已重生之人，要么用于教会。这个问题也可从基本思路，也就是上下文清楚看出来，因为主题是教会。前一节论述了人不会再如此毁灭自己了，而本节则论述了总会有某个教会出现。首先描述这个教会出现的情况，即人正在重生以成为一个教会的情况，然后描述这个重生之人的秉性。以这种方式来阐述能涵盖教会成员的整个状态。<br />人正在重生时的状态类似于“冷和热”的状态，或无信与仁和有信与仁的状态。人若不通过亲身经历，甚至通过反思亲身经历，不可能清楚地明白这一点。如今，由于正在重生之人极少，而在这些人中，反思或能反思其重生状态之人更是寥寥无几，所以我们就这个主题多说几句。当人正在重生时，他从主接受生命，在此之前，不能说他曾活过，属于尘世和肉体的生命并非生命，唯独属天属灵的生命才是生命。人通过重生从主接受真生命，因为此前他并没有生命，故他在无生命和真生命，即无信与仁和有些信与仁之间交替。无信与仁在此用“冷”来表示，而有些信与仁则用“热”来表示。<br />该主题的含义如下：每当人沉迷于自己的肉体和世俗之物时，就没有任何信和仁可言，也就是说，这是“冷”的时期。因为在这种时候，是肉体世俗之物，因而是他自己的东西在活动。只要人沉迷于这些东西，他就不在信和仁中，或远离了它们，以致他甚至不去思想属天属灵之物。这是因为，天堂之物与肉体之物无法共存，因为人的意愿已全然败坏。但当人的肉体和意愿之物不再活跃，而是沉寂下来时，主就会通过他的内在人运作，这时，他就处在信和仁中，在此被称为“热”。当他回到身体中时，就又活在“冷”中；当肉体或属肉体之物沉寂下来，仿佛不存在时，他就处在热中。这两种状态来回交替。因为人的情况乃是这样：属天属灵之物无法与他的肉体世俗之物共存，而是来回交替。凡要重生之人都会有这样的经历，只要他处在重生的状态，这种经历就会持续下去。人只能这样重生，即从死人变成活人，别无他法。如前所述，原因在于，他的意愿全然败坏，因此与他从主所接受的新意愿彻底分离，这个新意愿是主的，而不是人自己的。由此明显可知此处“冷与热”所表之义。<br />每个重生之人都通过亲身经历得知这一真相。也就是说，当沉迷于肉体世俗之物时，他就不在内在事物中，并远离之，以致他不但不去思想它们，反而一想到它们就感到冷；而当肉体世俗之物沉寂下来时，他就处在信和仁中。他通过亲身经历还能得知，这些状态交替进行。因此，当肉体世俗之物开始过度并寻求主宰时，他就陷入困境和试探，直到他被带回这样的状态：外在人变得顺从内在人。外在人绝不会顺从，除非它沉寂下来，仿佛不存在。上古教会的最后一代无法重生，因为如前所述，其觉知之物和意愿之物构成一个心智。所以，其觉知之物无法与其意愿之物分离，以使他们能交替处在属天属灵之物和肉体世俗之物中。因为他们对天堂之物一直感觉是冷的，而对恶欲之物则一直感觉是热的。</p>

<p><strong>[NCE]933.</strong> Cold and heat symbolizes the condition of a person who is regenerating, which is cold and hot toward the acceptance of faith and charity; cold symbolizes no faith or charity, but heat symbolizes [faith and] charity. This can be seen from the symbolism of cold and heat in the Word, which uses the terms to describe a person who is regenerating, or one who has regenerated, or the church. It can also be seen from the context above and below, which deals with the church. The last verse said that people could no longer destroy themselves in the same way. The present verse says that the church will always exist, first depicting what happens when it comes into existence — that is, when a person is reborn as a church{*1} — and soon after discussing the nature of a person who has already become regenerate. So it deals with every phase that people in the church pass through.<br />[2] There is only one really good way to see that when we are regenerating we go through these phases of cold and heat, or of faith and charity absent and present. That is through experience and through reflection on our experience. Few people regenerate, though, and few if any of those who regenerate can or do reflect on the state of their regeneration. So let me say a few words about it.<br />When we are being reborn, we receive life from the Lord, since up till then we cannot be said to have been alive. A life focused on the world and the body is not really life; only a life that is heavenly and spiritual is real. We receive real life from the Lord through regeneration, and since before that time we lack any life, we alternate between no life and true life — that is, between no faith or charity and some faith and charity. Here, cold symbolizes a lack of faith and charity, and heat, the presence of some faith and charity.<br />[3] This is the situation: Whenever we are caught up in bodily and worldly concerns, we experience a lack of faith and charity, or coldness. At such times our bodily and worldly interests — and so our self-interest — are active. As long as we are wrapped up in them, we are devoid of or distant from belief and neighborly love, so that we do not even think about heavenly and spiritual matters. The reason for the disconnection is that a heavenly focus and a bodily focus can never coexist in us, since the human will is lost beyond recall. When our bodily desires and the urges of our will stop agitating and fall quiet, though, the Lord works through our inner self, and we then come into faith and charity, which are called "heat" here. When we return to a bodily focus, we go back into the cold, and when the body and everything connected with it fade away almost to the point of vanishing, we regain the warmth, and so on in cycles. Such is the human condition — heavenly and spiritual values cannot coexist with bodily and worldly values in us but must alternate with them.<br />These are the things that take place in every regenerating person, lasting just as long as the process of regeneration does. There is no other way for us to be reborn, or in other words, from being dead to come alive, for the reason already given: our will is lost beyond recall. This will is entirely separate from the new will that we receive from the Lord and that is the Lord's, not ours.<br />All this now indicates what cold and heat symbolize here.<br />[4] Anyone who has been reborn can see from experience that this is how the matter stands. That is to say, when bodily and worldly considerations absorb us, we are absent and distant from internal ones. Not only do we fail to think at all about them but we also sense a kind of chill inside us. When bodily and worldly demands quiet down, on the other hand, we come under the influence of faith and charity.<br />Such an individual can also see from experience that these two phases alternate. So when bodily and worldly concerns start to overflow and try to dominate, we enter a period of distress and trial. The crisis lasts until we have been reduced to a state in which our outer self obeys our inner self — an obedience that is utterly impossible except when the outer self grows still and almost vanishes.<br />The final inheritors of the earliest church could not be reborn since, as noted [<a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_933/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_310" target=_top>310:1</a>, <a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_933/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_398" target=_top>398</a>, <a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_933/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_640" target=_top>640</a>, <a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_933/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_875#subsection-2-4" target=_top>875:4</a>, <a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_933/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_927#subsection-2-2" target=_top>927:2</a>], intellectual capacities and volitional capacities formed one mind in them. So they could not detach the ideas in their intellect from the urges of their will and therefore could not cycle back and forth between heavenly and spiritual pursuits on the one hand and bodily and worldly pursuits on the other. Instead they felt perpetual coldness toward the things of heaven and perpetual warmth for the objects of their desire, so that for them no alternation was possible.<br /><br /><strong>Footnotes:</strong><br />{*1} See note 1 in <a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_933/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_916" target=_top>916</a>.

That "cold and heat" signifies the state of man when he is being regenerated, which is like this in regard to the reception of faith and charity, and that "cold" signifies no faith and charity, and "heat" 
charity, is evident from the signification of "cold" and "heat" in the Word, where they are predicated of a man about to be regenerated, or being regenerated, or of the church. The same is also 
evident from the connection, that is, from what precedes and what follows; for the subject is the church (in the preceding verse that man would not again be able so to destroy himself, in this verse that 
some church will always come into existence), which is first described as to the way it comes into existence, that is, when the man is being regenerated so as to become a church, and then the quality 
of the regenerated man is treated of; so that the treatment of the subject covers every state of the man of the church.  [2] That his state when regenerated is as described, namely, a state of cold 
and heat, or of no faith and charity, and again of faith and charity, may not be so evident to anyone except from experience, and indeed from reflection in regard to the experience. And because there 
are few who are being regenerated, and among those who are being regenerated few if any who reflect, or who are able to reflect on the state of their regeneration, we may say a few words on the subject. 
When man is being regenerated, he receives life from the Lord; for before this he cannot be said to have lived, the life of the world and of the body not being life, but only that which is heavenly 
and spiritual. Through regeneration man receives real life from the Lord; and because he had no life before, there is an alternation of no life and of real life, that is, of no faith and charity, 
and of some faith and charity; no charity and faith being here signified by "cold" and some faith and charity by "heat."  [3] As regards this subject the case is this: Whenever man is in his corporeal 
and worldly things, there is then no faith and charity, that is, there is "cold" for then corporeal and worldly things, consequently those which are his own, are at work, and so long as the man is in 
these, he is absent or remote from faith and charity, so that he does not even think about heavenly and spiritual things. The reason of this is that heavenly and corporeal things can never be together 
in a man, for man's will has been utterly ruined. But when the things of man's body and will are not at work, but are quiescent, then the Lord works through his internal man, and then he is in faith 
and charity, which is here called "heat." When he again returns into the body he is again in cold; and when the body, or what is of the body, is quiescent, and as nothing, he is then in heat, and so 
on in alternation. For such is the condition of man that heavenly and spiritual things cannot be in him along with his corporeal and worldly things, but there are alternations. This is what takes place 
with everyone who is to be regenerated, and it goes on as long as he is in a state of regeneration; for in no other way is it possible for man to be regenerated, that is, from being dead to be made 
alive, for the reason, as already said, that his will has been utterly ruined, and is therefore completely separated from the new will, which he receives from the Lord and which is the Lord's and not 
the man's. Hence now it is evident what is here signified by "cold and heat."  [4] That such is the case every regenerated man may know from experience, that is to say, that when he is in corporeal 
and worldly things, he is absent and remote from internal things, so that he not only takes no thought about them, but feels in himself cold at the thought of them; but that when corporeal and worldly 
things are quiescent, he is in faith and charity. He may also know from experience that these states alternate, and that therefore when corporeal and worldly things begin to be in excess and to want 
to rule, he comes into straits and temptations, until he is reduced into such a state that the external man becomes compliant to the internal, a compliance it can never render until it is quiescent and 
as it were nothing. The last posterity of the Most Ancient Church could not be regenerated, because, as before said, with them the things of the understanding and of the will constituted one mind; and 
therefore the things of their understanding could not be separated from those of their will, so that they might in this manner be by turns in heavenly and spiritual things, and in corporeal and worldly 
things; but they had continual cold in regard to heavenly things and continual heat in regard to cupidities, so that they could have no alternation. </p>

<p align="center"><b>Elliott(1983-1999) 933</b></p><p><b>933.</b>
'Cold and heat' means the state of the person who is being regenerated, which, as regards reception of faith and charity, resembles cold and heat, 'cold' meaning when faith and charity do not exist, 
'heat' however when they do. This is clear from the meaning of 'cold and heat' in the Word where the two apply either to a person who is to be regenerated, or to one who has been regenerated, or to the 
Church. This matter is also clear from the train of thought, that is to say, from what comes before and after, for the subject is the Church. The previous verse dealt with the fact that man would no 
longer be able to destroy himself in that way, the present verse with the fact that some Church will always be emergent. First of all the situation when the Church comes into being is described, that 
is, when a person is being regenerated so that he may become the Church, and then the character of the now regenerate person is described. In this way the entire state of the member of the Church is 
dealt with. </p>
<p></p>
<p><b>[2]</b>
 The state of a person when he is being regenerated resembles 'cold and heat', that is, a point when faith and charity do not exist and then when they do. This does not become readily 
clear to anyone except from experience, and indeed through reflecting on experience. Now because those who are being regenerated are few, and of these, few if any reflect, or are capable of reflecting, 
on the state of their regeneration, let a brief consideration be given to the subject. When someone is being regenerated he is receiving life from the Lord, for he cannot be said to have been living 
prior to that. The life that belongs to the world and to the body is not life; celestial and spiritual life alone is life. Through regeneration a person receives life itself from the Lord, and because 
he had no life previously he alternates between no life and life itself, that is, between no faith and charity and some faith and charity. Here no faith and charity is meant by 'cold', some faith 
and charity by 'heat'. </p>
<p></p>
<p><b>[3]</b>
 The implications of this are as follows: Every time a person is engrossed in his own bodily and worldly interests faith and charity do not exist, that is, it is a period 
of 'cold'. For at such times it is bodily and worldly interests that are active, consequently things which are his own. And as long as a person is engrossed in these he is absent or far removed from faith 
and charity, with the result that he does not even think about celestial and spiritual things. The reason is that it is by no means possible with anyone for heavenly interests and bodily to exist 
side by side, for his will has been utterly corrupted. When however the bodily interests in a person and those of his will are inactive and quiescent, the Lord acts by way of his internal man and at 
that point faith and charity are present with him, which here is called 'heat'. When he reverts to the body he is again living in 'cold', and when the body, or what belongs to the body, is quiescent and 
so to speak non-existent, he is living in 'heat'. These two states come and go in turn. Man's condition is such that with him celestial and spiritual things cannot co-exist with his bodily and worldly 
interests, but come and go in turn. This is the experience of everyone who is to be regenerated, and it continues for as long as his state is one of being regenerated. For in no other way can a person 
be regenerated, that is, from being a dead man become one who is alive, the reason being, as has been stated, that his will is utterly corrupted and therefore completely separated from the new will 
he receives from the Lord, a will which is the Lord's and not the person's own. From these considerations it now becomes clear what 'cold and heat' means here. </p>
<p></p>
<p><b>[4]</b>
 The truth of this every regenerate 
person can know from experience. That is to say, when engrossed in bodily and worldly interests he is absent and far removed from things of an internal nature, and as a result he not only gives no 
thought to them, but also feels so to speak cold at even the thought of them. But when bodily and worldly interests are quiescent faith and charity are present with him. Experience can also teach that 
these states alternate with each other. This is why when bodily and worldly interests start to abound and seek to have dominion, he enters into distress and temptation, which persist until he has been 
brought back into that kind of state where the external man is conformable and subservient to the internal. The external man can never be subservient until it is quiescent and so to speak non-existent. 
The final descendants of the Most Ancient Church were unable to be regenerated, because, as has been stated, things of the understanding and those of the will with them constituted one single mind. 
Consequently things of the understanding were inseparable from those of their will, and so they were incapable of being engrossed by turns in celestial and spiritual interests and then in bodily and 
worldly. For them it was continual cold as regards heavenly things, and continual heat as regards evil desires, and so with them no alternation was possible. </p>

Quod 'frigus et aestus' significent statum hominis qui regeneratur, qui talis quoad recipiendum fidem et charitatem, [et] quod 'frigus' significet nullam fidem et charitatem, 'aestus' autem charitatem, 
constat a significatione 'frigoris et aestus' in Verbo, ubi praedicantur de regenerando vel regenerato, vel de Ecclesia; tum quoque constat a serie, nempe ab illis quae praecedunt et quae sequuntur, 
nam de Ecclesia agitur; in versu praecedente, quod homo non amplius ita se perdere poterit; in hoc versu, quod semper aliqua Ecclesia exstitura, quae describitur primum quomodo se habet cum fit, seu 
cum regeneratur homo ut fiat Ecclesia, et mox de regenerato, qualis; ita de omni statu hominis Ecclesiae.  [2] Quod talis ejus status sit cum regeneratur, nempe 'frigus et aestus,' seu nulla fides et 
charitas, tum fides et charitas, non ita constare alicui potest nisi ab experientia, et quidem per (x)reflexionem ad experientiam; et quia pauci sunt qui regenerantur, et inter eos qui regenerantur, 
pauci si ulli qui reflectunt, aut quibus reflectere datur, super statum suae regenerationis, his paucis licet dicere: homo cum regeneratur, vitam accipit a Domino, nam prius non vixisse dici potest; 
vita mundi et corporis non est vita, sed vita caelestis et spiritualis unice est vita; homo per regenerationem a Domino ipsam vitam accipit, et quia prius nullam vitam habuit, alternat nulla vita et ipsa 
vita, hoc est, nulla fides et charitas et aliqua fides et charitas; nulla fides et charitas hic significatur per 'frigus,' aliqua fides et charitas per 'aestum'; [3] quod ita se habet; quoties homo 
est in corporeis suis et mundanis, tunc est nulla fides et charitas, hoc est, 'frigus,' nam tunc operantur corporea et mundana, proinde quae sunt ejus propria; quamdiu homo est in iis, tunc est absens 
aut remotus a fide et charitate, sic ut ne quidem cogitet de caelestibus et spiritualibus; causa est quia nusquam simul esse possunt apud hominem caelestia et corporea, nam voluntas hominis prorsus 
deperdita est; at cum corporea hominis et ejus voluntaria non operantur sed quiescant, tunc Dominus per internum ejus hominem operatur et tunc est in fide et charitate, quod hic vocatur 'aestus'; cum 
iterum redit in corpus iterum est in frigore; et cum corpus seu quod corporis est, quiescit et quasi nullum est, tunc est in aestu; et sic per vices; nam talis est conditio hominis quod apud eum caelestia 
et spiritualia non possint simul esse cum ejus corporeis et mundanis, sed vices sunt: haec sunt quae unicuivis regenerando fiunt, et quidem tamdiu, quamdiu est in stat regenerationis; nam aliter 
homo non potest regenerari, hoc est, mortuo fieri vivus, ex causa, ut dictum, quia voluntas ejus prorsus deperdita est, quae ideo prorsus separatur a nova voluntate quam accipit a Domino, quae est Domini, 
non hominis: exinde nunc constat potest quid per 'frigus et aestum' hic significatur. [4] Quod ita se res habeat, quisque regeneratus potest ab experientia scire, nempe, quo cum in corporeis et 
mundanis est,tunc absens et remotus sit ab internis ut non solum de illis nihil cogitet sed apud se sentiat tunc quasi frigus sed cum quiescunt corporea et mundana, quod tunc in fide et charitate sit: 
tum quoque ab experientia scire potest quod haec alternent; quare etiam cum corporea et mundana superfluere incipiunt et volunt dominari, tunc in angustias et tentationes venit, usque dum in talem statum 
redactus sit ut externus homo obsequia praestet interno, qui obsequia nusquam praestare potest nisi dum quiescit et quasi nullus est.  Ultima posteritas Antiquissimae Ecclesiae non potuit regenerari, 
quia ut dictum, intellecta et voluntaria apud eos unum mentem constituerunt; quare intellectualia non potuerunt separari ab eorum voluntariis, et sic per vices esse in caelestibus et spiritualibus 
et per vices in corporeis et mundanis; sed iis erat continuum frigus in caelestibus et continuus aestus in cupiditatibus, sic ut apud eos nulla alternatio dari potuerit. </p>
