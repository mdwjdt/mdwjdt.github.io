<h3 align="center" class="ired">属天的奥秘 第10758节</h3>
<h4 align="center"></h4><p><strong>10758</strong>.最后，我与这个星球的灵人谈论我们地球居民对于复活的信仰。我说，他们无法想象人们死后立即进入来世，在那里显为人，脸、身体、手臂、脚，以及一切感觉，无论外在的，还是内在的，一应俱全。他们更无法想象他们穿着衣服，有家有住的地方。之所以如此，唯一的原因在于，地球上大多数人局限于肉体感官层面，因而认为他们看不见、摸不着的东西是不存在的；而且他们当中很少有人能从外在感官所感知的事物被引离转向内层事物，从而被提升到天堂之光。正因如此，当思想灵魂或灵时，他们无法获得一个人的观念。他们的观念是，灵魂或灵就像一阵风，空气或呼吸，没有任何形式，然而却含有某种生命力在里面。这就是为什么他们以为他们只有等到世界末日才能复活，他们称之为最后的审判；到那时，肉体尽管已化为尘土，消散于四风，但仍将被带回来，与它的灵魂或灵再度结合。<br />我补充说，他们被允许如此相信，是因为如前所述，他们的思维局限于感官层面，因而无法避免这种概念：灵魂或灵不可能像一个人一样以一个人的形式活着，除非它能取回它在世时所携带的身体。因此，除非有人说，这身体会复活，否则，他们将因无法理解而在心里拒绝关于复活和永生的教导。但尽管如此，关于复活的这种观念还是有它的好处，即：它引导人们相信死后的生命；这种信仰的结果是，当他们生病躺在床上，思维不再像以前那样局限于世俗和肉体事物，因而局限于感官事物时，就会相信他们离世之后将立即活着。这时，他们还谈论天堂，以及对死后随即在那里生活的希望，如此就远离了关于最后审判的教导。<br />我接着告诉他们，我有时感到惊讶的是：当那些信徒们谈论死后的生活，谈论他们即将离世或已经离世的亲朋好友，同时不去思想最后的审判时，他们就相信自己的亲朋好友死后立即将作为人活着或正在作为人活着。可一想到最后的审判，他们所持的这种观念就变成对他们肉体的物质观念，即肉体会再次与他们的灵魂结合。因为他们不知道，就其内层而言，每个人都是一个灵，正是这灵拥有身体里面的生命；而身体本身并没有任何生命。他们也不知道，正是每个人的灵赋予身体以人的形式，这个人主要是灵，灵存在于一个相似的形式中，但在肉眼面前是看不见的，然而在灵眼面前看得见的。<br />也正因如此，当一个人的灵的视觉被打开（这种打开通过移除肉体视觉实现）时，天使就会显现；因此，当天使向圣言中提到的古人显现时，他们看上去就是人。我有时也与在世为人时就认识的灵人交谈过。我问他们想不想再次披上他们的肉体，就像他们以前所想的那样。听到这话，一想到与肉体结合，他们就逃得远远的，并为自己在世时因盲目的信仰，未经任何理解就如此思想而充满惊讶。</p>

Finally I spoke to the spirits of that earth about the faith of the inhabitants of our earth in regard to the resurrection, saying that they cannot conceive that men come into the other life immediately 
after death, and then appear as men, in face, body, arms, feet, and all the senses external and internal; and still less that they are clothed with garments and have places of abode and habitations; 
and this merely for the reason that most of them think from the sensuous things of the body, and therefore believe that nothing has any existence except the things they see and touch; and also because 
few of them can be withdrawn from external sensuous things to interior ones, and thus be elevated into the light of heaven. From this it is that they cannot have any idea of a man in connection with 
their soul or spirit, but only an idea as of wind, air, or breath, of no form, in which, however, there is something vital. This is the reason why they do not believe that they will rise again except 
at the end of the world, which they call the Last Judgment, and that then the body though crumbled into dust and dispersed to all the winds is to be brought back and joined again to its soul or spirit. [2] 
I added that they are permitted to believe this, because, thinking as they do from sensuous things, they can in no other way avoid the conception that it is impossible for their soul or spirit 
to live as a man and in the human form unless it gets back that body which it carried about in the world; and therefore unless it were said that this body will rise again, they would at heart reject 
as incomprehensible the doctrine of the resurrection and of eternal life. Nevertheless this idea about the resurrection is attended with this useful result, that they believe in a life after death. 
And from this belief it follows that when they lie sick in bed, and do not think as before from worldly and bodily things, thus not from sensuous ones, they then believe that they will live immediately 
after their decease; and they also then speak about heaven and about their hope of life there immediately after death, in a way far removed from the doctrine about the Last Judgment.  [3] I further 
told them something that has occasionally excited my surprise, namely, that when those who are in the faith speak of the life after death, and of their friends who are either dead or dying, and do not 
at the moment think about the Last Judgment, they believe that their friends will live, or are living, as men immediately after their decease. But the moment that there flows in the thought of the Last 
Judgment, this idea is changed into a material idea about their earthly body, that it is again to be joined with their soul. For they do not know that in respect to his interiors every man is a spirit, 
and that it is this which lives in the body, and not the body from itself; and that the spirit of everyone is that from which the body has its human form, consequently which is chiefly the man, 
and in a like form, but invisible before the eyes of the body, yet visible before the eyes of spirits.  [4] And it is also from this that when the sight of a man's spirit is opened, which is effected 
by the removal of the sight of the body, angels are seen as men; as also did angels appear to the ancients of whom we read in the Word. I have also sometimes spoken with spirits whom I had known when 
they lived as men in the world, asking them whether they wish to be clothed again with their earthly body, as they had before thought. On hearing this they fled far away at the mere idea of such a conjunction, 
being filled with amazement that in the world they had so thought from a blind faith without any understanding. </p>

Finally I talked to the spirits belonging to that planet about the beliefs which the inhabitants of our planet have about rising again, that they cannot conceive of people immediately after death entering 
the next life and appearing there as people complete with face, body, arms, feet, and all the senses outward and inward. Still less can they conceive of them wearing clothes and having homes and 
places to live in. The sole reason why this should be so is that the thought of the majority there is confined to the level of the physical senses, and therefore they think that things which they cannot 
see and touch have no existence; and also that few of them can be drawn away from things perceived by the outward senses to those on more internal levels and thereby be raised to the light of heaven. 
So it is that when they think of the soul or the spirit they can have no idea of a human being. Their idea is of a puff of wind, air, or breath that is formless yet has some vitality in it. This is 
the reason why they do not think they are going to rise again except at the end of the world, which they call the last judgement, when the body, though it has disintegrated into dust and been dispersed 
to the four winds, will be brought back and re-joined to its soul or spirit. </p>
<p><b>[2]</b>
 I added that they are permitted to believe this because, as has been stated, their thought is confined to the level 
of the senses and therefore they are incapable of grasping anything other than this - that the soul or spirit cannot live as a person and in a human form unless it takes on the body which it carried 
around in the world. Consequently unless it were said that the body was going to rise again they would in their heart reject teachings about resurrection and eternal life as being unintelligible. But 
in spite of this that idea about rising again has its advantages, in that it leads people to believe in life after death, and the result of this belief is that when they lie sick on their bed and their 
thought is not confined, as it was previously, to worldly and bodily interests, thus to things on the level of the senses, they believe that they will be alive immediately after they have departed this 
life. They also talk then about heaven and about the hope of life there immediately after death, doing so in a way far removed from the teaching regarding a last judgement.  </p>
<p></p>
<p><b>[3]</b>
 I went on to tell 
them that I have at times been amazed that, when believers talk about life after death and about their own folk who are departing or have departed this life, and do not at the same time think about 
the last judgement, they believe that those folk will be or are living as people immediately after death. But as soon as thought about the last judgement enters in, that idea they have is turned into 
a material idea of their earthly body, which is to be joined again to their soul. For they do not know that inwardly every person is a spirit and that this is what possesses the life within the body; 
by itself the body has no life. Nor do they know that everyone's spirit is what gives the body its human form, consequently that it is who the person is primarily, and that it exists within a similar 
form, which however is not visible before the eyes of the body, but is visible before the eyes of spirits. </p>
<p><b>[4]</b>
 Therefore also, when the sight of a person's spirit is opened, which is accomplished by 
the removal of physical sight, angels appear; and so it was that when they appeared to the ancients referred to in the Word, angels were seen as people. I have also talked at times to spirits whom I had 
known when they were living as people in the world. I have asked them whether they wished to be reclothed with their earthly body, as they had previously thought they were going to be. On hearing this 
the very idea of being joined to that body made them flee far away, struck with amazement that in the world blind belief devoid of all understanding had led them to think that way.  </p>

Demum locutus sum cum spiritibus illius telluris de fide incolarum nostrae telluris de resurrectione, quod non possint concipere quod {1}homines statim post mortem {2} in alteram vitam {3}veniant, et 
tunc {4}appareant ut homines quoad faciem, corpus, bracchia, pedes, et quoad omnes sensus externos et internos; et adhuc minus, quod vestibus {5}sint induti; et quod mansiones et habitacula illis sint; 
et hoc solum ex causa quia plerique ibi ex sensualibus, quae sunt corporis, cogitant, ac ideo credunt nihil esse quae non vident et tangunt; tum quia pauci eorum subduci a sensualibus externis queant 
ad interiora, {6}et sic elevari in lucem caeli; inde est quod non de anima {7}seu spiritu suo aliquam ideam hominis habere possint, sed ideam sicut de vento, aere aut pneumate nullius formae, {8}in 
quo tamen aliquid vitale; haec causa est quod non credant se resurrecturos quam in fine mundi, quem ultimum judicium vocant, et tunc quod corpus, tametsi collapsum in pulverem et dissipatum in omnes 
ventos, reducendum sit et conjungendum animae suae seu spiritui suo; [2] addebam quod hoc permittatur illis credere, quoniam non aliter capere possunt, {9}quia solum ex sensualibus, ut dictum est, cogitant, 
quam quod {10}anima seu spiritus ejus non vivere homo et in humana forma possit, nisi recipiat id corpus quod circumtulit in mundo; quare nisi diceretur id resurgere, doctrinam de resurrectione 
et de vita aeterna, {11}ut incomprehensibilem, corde rejicerent; sed usque haec idea de resurrectione secum id utile habet, quod credant vitam post mortem; ex qua {12}fide sequitur quod cum jacent aegroti 
in lecto, et non ex mundanis et corporeis, ita non ex sensualibus, ut prius, cogitant, tunc credant se statim post obitum victuros; loquuntur etiam tunc de caelo, (c)ac de spe vitae ibi statim 
post mortem remotive a doctrinali de ultimo judicio; [3] {13}narrabam porro quod aliquoties miratus sim (d)quod quando illi qui in fide sunt loquuntur de vita post mortem, deque suis qui obeunt vel obiverunt, 
et tunc non simul cogitant de ultimo judicio, credant {14}illos victuros aut vivere homines statim post obitum; sed haec idea, ut primum influit cogitatio de ultimo judicio, mutatur in ideam 
materialem de terrestri suo corpore, quod iterum conjungendum (t)suae animae sit; nesciant enim quod unusquisque homo sit spiritus quoad interiora sua, et quod ille sit qui vivit in corpore, et non corpus 
ex se; et quod spiritus cujusvis sit, ex quo corpus formam suam humanam habet, consequenter qui principaliter homo est, et in simili forma, sed invisibili coram oculis corporis, at visibili coram 
oculis spirituum; [4] inde etiam cum aperitur visus spiritus hominis, quod fit per remotionem visus corporis, apparent angeli; ita ut homines angeli apparuerunt antiquis, de quibus in Verbo.  {15}Locutus 
etiam sum aliquoties cum spiritibus quos cum vixerant homines in mundo, novi, quaerendo num velint {16}reindui terrestri suo corpore, sicut cogitaverant prius, quo audito ad solam ideam conjunctionis 
ejus longe aufugerunt, perculsi stupore quod in mundo ex caeca fide absque omni intellectu ita cogitaverint. @1 homo$ @2 i illico$ @3 veniat$ @4 appareat ut homo$ @5 appareant$ @6 et quod ideo
