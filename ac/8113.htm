<h3 align="center" class="ired">属天的奥秘 第8113节</h3>
<h4 align="center"></h4><p><strong>8113.</strong>我不仅能凭木星灵靠近和流注的温柔和甜蜜，还能凭以下事实认出他们的同在：他们主要流入我的脸，使这张脸微笑、愉快，并且在他们同在期间一直这样。我被告知，他们使其星球居民的脸也这样，因为他们想将安宁和快乐灌输到他们心里。当他们将这安宁和快乐灌输到我里面时，我感觉它们充满我的胸腔和内心；同时，造成不安和不快、刺激并煽动心智，使之陷入各种动乱的对未来的渴望和焦虑也一扫而空。我由此能清楚看出木星居民的生命是何品质。这些灵人告诉我说，他们的百姓并不害怕死亡，只是对失去丈夫或妻子和孩子有点小小的负担，因为他们很肯定地知道肉体的死亡是生命的一种延续，之后他们会变得更加快乐。</p>

I was able to recognize the presence of the spirits of Jupiter, not only from the gentleness and sweetness of their approach and influx, but also from the fact that they inflowed most especially into 
the face, and that they disposed it to be smiling and cheerful, and continually so while they were present. It was said that they so dispose the faces of the inhabitants of their earth, for they wish 
to inspire them with tranquillity and delight of heart. This tranquillity and delight with which they inspired me sensibly filled my chest and heart. The desires and anxieties about the future, which 
induce intranquility and unpleasantness, and excite and agitate the mind into various disturbances, were then removed. From this I could clearly see what was the quality of the life of the inhabitants 
of the planet Jupiter. They told me that they do not fear death, except a little on account of the loss of their married partner and children, because they know of a certainty that the death of the 
body is a continuation of life, and that after it they become more happy. </p>

I was able to recognize that spirits belonging to Jupiter were present, not only from their gentleness and sweetness as they made their approach and when they exerted an influence but also from the fact 
that their influence was directed mainly onto my face. They made it smiling and cheerful and kept it like that while they were present. I was told that they made the faces of inhabitants on their 
planet like that, for they wish to instill calm and delight into their hearts. When they instilled that calm and delight into me I felt it filling my chest and heart; at the same time those desires and 
anxious cares about things to come which lead to the absence of peace and joy, disturbing the mind and creating all kinds of turmoil there, were removed. This made clear to me what the life of the inhabitants 
of the planet Jupiter was like. Those spirits told me that their people have no fear of death, except for the little they have over the loss of husband or wife and of children. They have no 
fear of it because they know for certain that the death of the body is a continuation of life, and that subsequently they become all the happier. </p>

Praesentiam spirituum Jovialium non modo cognoscere potui ex allapsus et influxus lenitudine et suavitate, sed etiam ex eo quod influerent quam maxime in faciem, et illam disponerent ridentem (c)et 
hilarem, (c)et id continue dum aderant; dictum quod ita disponerent facies incolarum telluris suae, nam eis inspirare volunt tranquillitatem et jucunditatem cordis; tranquillitas et jucunditas illa quae 
ab illis mihi inspirabatur implebat sensibiliter thoracem et cor; removebantur tunc cupiditates et sollicitudines de futuris, quae intranquillum et injucundum inducunt, ac animum in motus varios excitant 
et agitant; inde constare mihi potuit qualis vita incolarum telluris Jovis esset; dictum est ab illis mihi quod nec timeant mortem, risi paululum propter jacturam conjugis et {1}liberorum; ex causa 
quia pro certo sciunt quod mors corporis sit continuatio vitae, ac quod postea feliciores fiant. 	@1 infantum; et$ </p>
