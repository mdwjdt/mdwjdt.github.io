<h3 align="center" class="ired">属天的奥秘 第5579节</h3>
<h4 align="center"></h4><p><strong>5579.</strong>“他们的谷子吃尽了”表当真理缺乏时。这从“谷子”的含义清楚可知，“谷子”是指真理（参看<a href="5276.htm">5276</a>，<a href="5280.htm">5280</a>，<a href="5292.htm">5292</a>，<a href="5402.htm">5402</a>节）；真理缺乏这一事实由“他们的谷子吃尽了”来表示。在灵界，人们因真理和良善而得饱足，这些就是他们的食物（<a href="5576.htm">5576</a>节）。但是，一旦这些食物达到目的，他们就会再次进入缺乏的状态。这就像人以物质食物得滋养，一旦这食物达到目的，那人就又感到饥饿。对灵界里的人来说，这种饥饿，即属灵事物的缺乏，就是晚上，或他们一天当中最暗的时候；但随之而来的是黎明和早晨。那里的人会经历这样的交替阶段。他们进入这种晚上或属灵饥饿的状态，是为了叫他们对真理和良善感到饥饿，并渴望它们；当他们渴求真理和良善时，真理和良善就会给他们带来更多营养，就像物质食物对饥肠辘辘的人来说更有营养一样。由此可见当真理缺乏时，属灵事物的缺乏是什么意思。</p>

<p align="center"><b>Potts(1905-1910) 5579</b></p><p><b>5579.</b>
When they had finished the eating of the produce. That this signifies when truths failed, is evident from the signification of "produce," as being truth (see n. 5276, 5280, 5292, 5402); that truth failed 
is signified by their "finishing the eating of it." Those who are in the spiritual world are sated with things true and good, for these are their food (n. 5576); but when these have served their 
purpose, they come again into want. This is as with the nourishment of man by material food when this has fulfilled its use, hunger comes on again. The hunger that is a need of spiritual things, in the 
spiritual world is evening or the twilight of their day; but after it comes daybreak and morning. Thus there are alternations there. They come into that evening or into spiritual hunger, in order that 
they may feel hungry and long for truths and goods, which yield them more nourishment when they are hungry, just as does material food to one who is famishing. From all this it is evident what is meant 
by the need of spiritual things when truths failed. </p>

<p align="center"><b>Elliott(1983-1999) 5579</b></p><p><b>5579.</b>
'When they had finished eating the corn' means when there deficiency of truths. This is clear from the meaning of 'the corn' as truth, dealt with in <a href="5276.htm">5276</a>, <a href="5280.htm">5280</a>, <a href="5292.htm">5292</a>, <a href="5402.htm">5402</a> - the fact that there was a 
deficiency of such truth being meant by 'they had finished eating it'. The situation in the spiritual world is that those there satisfy their hunger with truths and forms of good; for they constitute 
the food for those there, <a href="5576.htm">5576</a>. But once that food has served its purpose those people enter a further state of dearth. It is like the nourishing of a person with material food, in that once this food 
has served its purpose that person feels hungry again. This kind of hunger, which is a dearth of spiritual things, is eveningtime for those in the spiritual world, or the darkest part of their day; 
but this is followed by twilight and morning. Those there pass through alternating phases Like these. They enter that eveningtime or state of spiritual hunger to the end that they may long for and have 
a desire for truths and forms of good, which are more nutritious when they are hungry for them, even as material food is for someone who is famished. From this one may see what is meant by a dearth 
of spiritual things when there was a deficiency of truths. </p>

`Sicut absolvissent comedere annonam': quod significet cum vera deficerent, constat ex significatione `annonae' quod {1}sit verum, de qua n. 5276, 5280, 5292, 5402; {2}quod verum deficeret, significatur 
per quod `absolvissent comedere illam'. In spirituali mundo ita se habet quod satientur veris et bonis, haec enim sunt illis qui ibi cibus, n. 5776; at cum haec cesserant illis in usum, iterum in 
indigentiam veniunt; se habet hoc sicut nutritio hominis per cibum materialem, hic cibus cum cesserat in usum, iterum fames venit; haec fames, quae est indigentia spiritualium, {3}in spirituali mundo 
est {4} vespera, seu umbra diei eorum, at post illam venit diluculum et mane; ita vices ibi alternantur; in vesperam illam, seu in spiritualem famem veniunt, ut appetant et desiderent vera et bona, quae 
cum esuriuntur nutritioni melius cedunt, sicut cibus materialis famelico. {5}Ex his constare potest quid intelligitur per indigentiam spiritualium cum vera deficerent. @1 sint vera$ @2 quae quod
