<h3 align="center" class="ired">属天的奥秘 第10026节</h3>
<h4 align="center"></h4><p><strong>10026</strong>.“要取些小公牛的血”表被安置在属世人或外在人中的神性真理。这从“血”和“小公牛”的含义清楚可知：“血”是指从主的神性良善发出的神性真理，如下文所述；“小公牛”是指人的属世层，它必须被洁净，必须拥有植入它的真理与良善（参看<a href="9990.htm">9990</a>节）。此处之所以提到“血”，并且其中一点血必须抹在坛角，剩下的都倒在坛的底座上，是因为在圣言中，“血”表示从主的神性良善发出的神性真理，一切洁净都通过这真理实现。事实上，真理指教一个人何为良善，当如何生活；当此人知道这一切时，对良善的情感或爱才能开始被植入，他由此才能重生。因为在一个人能拥有信仰，过信仰的生活，就是良善的生活之前，知识必须首先到来。邪恶与虚假的一切洁除，因而一切重生都通过信之真理实现（参看<a href="9959.htm">9959</a>节所提到的地方）。<br />那些不知道圣言内义，因而不知道“血”表示神性真理，也不知道洁净或洁除由主通过神性真理实现的人，会以为人因主的宝血而洁净，他们将宝血理解为主在十字架上受难。但是，要让他们知道，没有人因主在十字架上的受难，因而因主的宝血而洁净；人只有通过遵行主诫命的生活才能洁净，如主在许多地方亲自教导的。十字架受难是主所经历的试探的最后阶段，主通过试探的最后阶段完全荣耀了祂的人身，如祂自己在路加福音中所说的：<br />基督不是要这样受害，又进入祂的荣耀吗？（路加福音<a href="http://39-27.cn/路24.26.htm">24:26</a>）<br />因为主降世是为了征服地狱，使一切事物恢复秩序，甚至使天堂里的事物恢复秩序，这一切通过祂允许自己所经历的试探而实现。十字架受难是祂所经历的试探的最后阶段，祂通过这最后阶段完全战胜地狱，给天堂带来秩序，同时荣耀了祂的人身。若非祂做到这一切，没有人能得救（可参看<a href="9528.htm">9528</a>，<a href="9715.htm">9715</a>，<a href="9937.htm">9937</a>，<a href="10019.htm">10019</a>节所提到的地方对这些问题所作的大量说明）；“主的宝血”表示从祂的神性良善发出的神性真理（<a href="4735.htm">4735</a>，<a href="6378.htm">6378</a>，<a href="6978.htm">6978</a>，<a href="7317.htm">7317</a>，<a href="7326.htm">7326</a>，<a href="7850.htm">7850</a>，<a href="9127.htm">9127</a>，<a href="9393.htm">9393</a>节）。</p>

And thou shalt take of the blood of the bullock. That this signifies Divine truth accommodated in the natural or external man, is evident from the signification of "blood," as being the Divine truth 
that proceeds from the Lord's Divine good (of which below); and from the signification of "the bullock," as being the natural of man, which is to be purified, and in which truth and good are to be implanted 
(see n. 9990). That mention is here first made of "blood," and that it was to be put on the horns of the altar, and the rest of it poured out at its base, is because by "blood" in the Word is signified 
the Divine truth that proceeds from the Lord's Divine good, and all purification is effected thereby, for truth teaches man what is good and how he should live, and when a man knows this, then 
for the first time can the affection or love of good be implanted, and thus the man be regenerated. For knowledge must come first, before man can have faith, and live the life of faith, which is the 
life of good. (That all purification from evils and falsities is effected through the truths of faith, consequently all regeneration, see the places cited in n. 9959.) [2] They who have no knowledge 
of the internal sense of the Word, thus who do not know that by "blood" is signified Divine truth, and that by this from the Lord is effected purification, believe that man is purified by the blood of 
the Lord, by which they understand His passion of the cross. But be it known to them that no one is purified by the Lord's passion of the cross, thus by His blood; but by a life according to His precepts, 
as He Himself teaches in many places. The passion of the cross was the last of the Lord's temptation, by which He fully glorified His Human, as He Himself also says in Luke: </p>
<p>     Ought not Christ 
to suffer this, and to enter into His glory? (Luke 24:26). For the Lord came into the world that He might subjugate the hells and bring back all things into order, even in the heavens, which was 
effected through temptations admitted into Himself; and the passion of the cross was the last of His temptation, by which He fully conquered the hells, and set the heavens in order, and at the same time 
glorified His Human; and unless He had done this, no man could have been saved (but see what has been abundantly shown before on these subjects at the places cited in n. 9528, 9715, 9937, 10019); and 
that by "the blood of the Lord" is signified the Divine truth that proceeds from His Divine good (n. 4735, 6378, 6978, 7317, 7326, 7850, 9127, 9393). </p>

'And you shall take some of the blood of the young bull' means Divine Truth accommodated to the natural or external man. This is clear from the meaning of 'the blood' as Divine Truth emanating from the 
Lord's Divine Good, dealt with below; and from the meaning of 'the young bull' as the natural level in a person, which must be purified and must have truth and good implanted in it, dealt with in <a href="9990.htm">9990</a>. 
The reason why the blood is here spoken of first<A name="fntext1"></a><A href="#fn1"><sup>a</sup></a> and why some of it must be put on the horns of the altar and the remainder poured out at the base of it is that in the Word 'blood' means Divine 
Truth emanating from the Lord's Divine Good, and by means of that Truth all purification is accomplished. For truth teaches a person what good is and how he ought to live; and when the person knows this 
an affection for or love of good can start to be implanted, and he can thereby be regenerated. For knowledge must be received before a person can possess faith and lead the life of faith, which is 
the life of good. For the truth that all purification from evils and falsities, and consequently all regeneration, is accomplished by means of the truths of faith, see the places referred to in <a href="9959.htm">9959</a>. 
 </p>
<p></p>
<p><b>[2]</b>
 Those who are ignorant of the inner meaning of the Word, thus those who do not know that 'blood' means Divine Truth nor that purification is accomplished by the Lord by means of it, suppose that 
a person is made pure by the Lord's blood, by which they understand His suffering on the Cross. But let them know that no one is made pure by the Lord's suffering on the Cross, and so by His blood, 
only by a life in accord with His commandments, as He Himself teaches in many places. The suffering on the Cross was the final stage of temptation which the Lord underwent and through which He fully 
glorified His Human, as indeed He Himself says in Luke,  </p>
<blockquote>
Ought not the Christ to have suffered this and to enter into His glory? <a href="http://bible.gospelcom.net/cgi-bin/bible?passage=Luke%2024:26&amp;version=ESV&amp;interface=print&amp;showfn=yes&amp;showxref">Luke 24:26</a>.  
</blockquote>
<p>For the Lord came into the world to subdue the hells 
and to restore all things to order, even those in the heavens, which was accomplished through the temptations He allowed Himself to undergo. The suffering on the Cross was the final stage of temptation 
undergone by Him, through which He gained total victory over the hells, brought order to the heavens, and at the same time glorified His Human. And unless He had done all this, no one could have been 
saved. But see what has already been shown abundantly on these matters in the places referred to in <a href="9528.htm">9528</a>, <a href="9715.htm">9715</a>, <a href="9937.htm">9937</a>, <a href="10019.htm">10019</a>, and that by 'blood', and also 'the Lord's blood', Divine Truth emanating 
from His Divine Good is meant, <a href="4735.htm">4735</a>, <a href="6378.htm">6378</a>, <a href="6978.htm">6978</a>, <a href="7317.htm">7317</a>, <a href="7326.htm">7326</a>, <a href="7850.htm">7850</a>, <a href="9127.htm">9127</a>, <a href="9393.htm">9393</a>.

`Et accipies de sanguine juvenci': quod significet Divinum Verum accommodatum naturali seu externo homini {1}, constat ex significatione `sanguinis' quod sit Divinum Verum procedens a Divino Bono Domini, 
de qua sequitur, et ex significatione `juvenci' quod sit naturale hominis, quod purificandum et cui implantandum verum et bonum, de qua n. 9990.  Quod hic primum de sanguine dicatur, et quod is 
dandus sit super cornua altaris et reliquum ejus effundendum ad fundamentum ejus, est quia per `sanguinem' in Verbo significatur Divinum Verum procedens ex Divino Bono Domini, et per id verum fit omnis 
purificatio, nam verum docet hominem quid bonum et quomodo vivet, et cum homo id novit, tunc primum implantari potest affectio (o)seu amor boni, et sic regenerari; (o)cognitio enim praecedet antequam 
homo fidem habere potest et vitam fidei vivere, quae est vita boni; quod omnis purificatio a malis et falsis fiat per vera fidei, proinde omnis regeneratio, videantur citata n. 9959. 	[2] Qui non sensum 
internum Verbi norunt, (o)ita qui non sciunt quod per `sanguinem' significetur Divinum Verum, et per hoc a Domino fiat purificatio, credunt quod homo purificetur per sanguinem Domini, per quem intelligunt 
{2} passionem crucis Ipsius; ast sciant quod per passionem crucis Domini {3}, ita {4} per sanguinem Ipsius, nemo purificetur {5}, sed per vitam secundum praecepta Ipsius {6}, ut Ipse docet 
multis in locis; passio crucis fuit ultimum tentationis Domini, per quam (o)plene glorificavit Humanum Suum, (m)ut quoque Ipse dicit apud Lucam,      	Nonne hoc oportebat {7} pati Christum, et ingredi 
in gloriam Suam? xxiv 26;(n) Dominus enim in mundum {8} venit ut subjugaret inferna, (c)et redigeret omnia in ordinem, etiam in caelis, quod factum est per admissas in Se tentationes; et passio crucis 
fuit ultimum tentationis Ipsius, per quam plenarie vicit inferna (c)et disposuit in ordinem caelos, et simul Humanum Suum glorificavit; et {9} nisi ita fecisset, nemo hominum salvari potuisset; sed 
videantur quae de his prius in locis citatis n. 9528 et n. 9715, 9937, 10,019, copiose ostensa sunt, et quod per `sanguinem', et quoque per `sanguinem Domini' significetur Divinum Verum procedens a 
Divino Bono Ipsius, n. 4735, (x)6378, 6978, 7317, 7326, 7850, 9127, 9393. @1 cp n. 10,020$ @2 et quod salventur per$ @3 ast per intuitionem passionis Ipsius nemo salvatur$ @4 d ita i ac$ @5 purificatur$ @6
