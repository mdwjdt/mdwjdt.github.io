<h3 align="center" class="ired">属天的奥秘 第7571节</h3>
<h4 align="center"></h4><p><strong>7571.</strong>“并埃及地的田间各样菜蔬上”表属世心智中教会的一切真理。这从“菜蔬”、“田”和“埃及地”的含义清楚可知：“菜蔬”是指真理，如下文所述；“田”是指教会，如前所述（<a href="7557.htm">7557</a>节）；“埃及地”是指属世心智，也如前所述（<a href="7569.htm">7569</a>节）。“菜蔬（或植物）”之所以表示真理，是因为“地”表示教会，“田”也表示教会；因此，它们所产的一切或表示信之真理，或表示仁之良善，因为这些是教会的产物。“田间菜蔬（或译为植物，草等）”表示总体上田里生长的一切，这从主在马太福音中的比喻明显看出来：<br />天国好像人撒好种在田里，到（菜蔬）长苗吐穗的时候，稗子也显出来。（马太福音<a href="http://39-27.cn/太13.24.htm">13:24</a>，<a href="http://39-27.cn/太13.26.htm">26</a>）<br />此处很明显，用来代表田间出产的“菜蔬”表示教会的真理，“稗子”表示虚假。诚然，这个比喻是一个对比，但在圣言中，一切对比都建立在具有灵义的事物基础上（<a href="3579.htm">3579</a>节）。诗篇：<br />祂使草生长，给牲畜吃，使菜蔬发长，供给人用，使粮食从地里生出。 （诗篇<a href="http://39-27.cn/诗104.14.htm">104:14</a>）<br />代表田间出产的“菜蔬”在内义上也表示真理。<br /><br />祂使我躺卧在草场上，领我在可安歇的水边。祂重新创造我的灵魂。（诗篇<a href="http://39-27.cn/诗23.2.htm">23:2</a>-<a href="http://39-27.cn/诗23.3.htm">3</a>）<br />“草场”表示滋养灵魂的属灵养分，故经上说“祂重新创造我的灵魂”。以赛亚书：<br />宁林的众水都已荒凉，青草枯乾，菜蔬灭没，青绿之物一无所有。（以赛亚书<a href="http://39-27.cn/赛15.6.htm">15:6</a>）<br /><br />我要使大山小冈变为荒场，使其上的花草都枯干；我要使江河变为洲岛，我要引瞎子行不认识的道。（以赛亚书<a href="http://39-27.cn/赛42.15.htm">42:15</a>，<a href="http://39-27.cn/赛42.16.htm">16</a>）<br />耶利米书：<br />这地悲哀，一切田野的青草枯干，要到几时呢？因其上居民的恶行，牲畜和飞鸟都灭绝了。（耶利米书<a href="http://39-27.cn/耶12.4.htm">12:4</a>）<br /><br />田野的母鹿生下小鹿，就撇弃，因为无草。野驴站在山冈上，吞风好像海怪，因为无草。（耶利米书<a href="http://39-27.cn/耶14.5.htm">14:5</a>-<a href="http://39-27.cn/耶14.6.htm">6</a>）<br />约珥书：<br />田野的走兽啊，不要惧怕！因为旷野的居所长草，树木结果，无花果树、葡萄树也都效力。（约珥书<a href="http://39-27.cn/珥2.22.htm">2:22</a>）<br />阿摩司书：<br />蝗虫吃尽那地青草的时候，我说，主耶和华啊，求你赦免！因为雅各弱小，他怎能站立得住呢？（阿摩司书<a href="http://39-27.cn/摩7.2.htm">7:2</a>）<br />撒迦利亚书：<br />当春雨的季节，你们要向耶和华求雨。耶和华必造乌云，为他们降下阵雨，把田园的菜蔬赐给人。（撒迦利亚书<a href="http://39-27.cn/亚10.1.htm">10:1</a>）<br />启示录：<br />第五位天使吹号，并且吩咐它们说，不可伤害地上的草和各样青物，并一切树木。（启示录<a href="http://39-27.cn/启9.1.htm">9:1</a>，<a href="http://39-27.cn/启9.4.htm">4</a>）<br />谁都能看出，在这些经文中，所指的并不是草和菜蔬，取而代之的是诸如属于教会的那类事物；显然，“地上的草或菜蔬”和“田里的草或菜蔬”表示信之真理。若没有这种灵义，没有人会知道为何经上在启示录中说，当第五位天使吹号时，他们“不可伤害地上的草和各样青物”。也没有人知道耶利米书中这段经文是什么意思，即：“田野的母鹿生下小鹿，就撇弃，因为无草。野驴吞风好像海怪，因为无草”；同样没有人知道其它许多经文是什么意思。由此明显可知，人对圣言的理解何等地之少，人对其中包含的许多事物的概念何等世俗化，除非他知道它们的灵义是什么，至少知道圣言的每一个细节都蕴含神圣之物。</p>

<p align="center"><b>Potts(1905-1910) 7571</b></p><p><b>7571.</b>
And upon every herb of the field in the land of Egypt. That this signifies every truth of the church in the natural mind, is evident from the signification of "herb," as being truth (of which in what 
follows); from the signification of "field," as being the church (of which above, n. 7557); and from the signification of "the land of Egypt," as being the natural mind (of which also above, n. 7569). 
That "herb" signifies truth is because the "land" signifies the church, also a "field;" and hence all the produce from it signifies either the truth that is of faith, or the good that is of charity, 
for these are of the church. By the "herb of the field" is meant all in general that comes from the field, as is plain from the Lord's parable in Matthew: </p>
<p>     The kingdom of the heavens is likened 
unto a man who sowed good seed in his field, but when the herb sprouted forth and bore fruit, then appeared the tares (Matt. 13:24, 26); </p>
<p>where "the herb" stands for the produce of the field. That by 
"the herb" is here signified the truth of the church, and by "tares" falsity is evident; it is indeed a comparison, but all the comparisons in the Word are from significatives (n. 3579). In David: </p>
<p>  
   Who causeth grass to sprout forth for the beast, and herb for the ministry of man; to bring forth bread out of the earth (Ps. 104:14); </p>
<p>where also "herb" stands for the produce of the field, and by 
it in the internal sense is here signified truth. [2] In the same: </p>
<p>     In pastures of herb He will make me lie down, unto the waters of rests He will lead me, He will create anew my soul (Ps. 23:2-3); </p>
<p>"pastures 
of herb" denote the spiritual nourishment which is of the soul, and therefore it is said "He will create anew my soul." In Isaiah: </p>
<p>     The waters of Nimrim shall be desolations, because 
the grass is dried up, the herb is consumed, there is no green thing (Isa. 15:6).      I will make waste mountains and hills, and I will dry up all their herb, and I will make the rivers islands, 
and I will lead the blind in a way that they have not known (Isa. 42:15).      How long shall the land mourn, and the herb of every field wither? For the wickedness of them that dwell therein the beasts 
and the bird shall be consumed (Jer. 12:4).      The hind calved in the field, but forsook it, because there was no herb, and the wild asses stood on the hills, they snuffed the wind like whales 
because there was no herb (Jer. 14:5-6).      Be not afraid, ye beasts of my fields, for the habitations of the wilderness are become grassy, for the tree will bear her fruit, the fig tree and the vine 
will yield its strength (Joel 2:22).      When the locusts had completed the devouring of the herb of the land, I said, O Lord Jehovih, forgive, I beseech Thee; how shall Jacob stand when he is little? 
(Amos. 7:2.)      Ask ye of Jehovah the latter rain in season; Jehovah will make clouds, and will give them a shower of rain, to a man herb in the field (Zech. 10:1).      The fifth angel sounded, 
and it was said that they should not hurt the grass of the earth, nor any green thing, nor any tree (Rev. 9:1, 4). [3] Everyone can see that in these passages grass and herb are not meant, but 
instead of them such things as are of the church; that by the "herb of the land" and the "herb of the field" is meant the truth which is of faith is plain. Without such a spiritual sense no one would 
ever know why it should be said, in John, when the fifth angel sounded, that "they should not hurt the grass of the earth, nor any green thing"; nor would anyone know what is meant in Jeremiah, "The hind 
calved in the field, but forsook it, because there was no herb, and the wild asses snuffed the wind like whales because there was no herb"; nor what is meant in many other passages. From this it is 
evident how little the Word is understood, and how earthly an idea would be had of very many things contained therein, unless it were known what they signify; at least that there is what is holy in 
every detail. </p>

<p align="center"><b>Elliott(1983-1999) 7571</b></p><p><b>7571.</b>
'And on every plant of the field in the land of Egypt' means every truth of the Church in the natural mind. This is clear from the meaning of 'plant' as truth, dealt with below; from the meaning of 'the 
field' as the Church, dealt with above in <a href="7557.htm">7557</a>; and from the meaning of 'the land of Egypt' as the natural mind, also dealt with above, in <a href="7569.htm">7569</a>. The reason why 'plant' means truth is that 'the land' 
means the Church, as also does 'the field'; and all that they produce means either the truth of faith or the good of charity, since these are products of the Church. 'Plant of the field' is used to 
mean everything in general that is grown in the field, as is evident from the Lord's parable in Matthew,  </p>
<blockquote>
The kingdom of heaven may be likened to a person sowing good seed in his field. When the plant 
sprouted and bore fruit, then the tares appeared. <a href="http://bible.gospelcom.net/cgi-bin/bible?passage=Matt%2013:24,%2026&amp;version=ESV&amp;interface=print&amp;showfn=yes&amp;showxref">Matt 13:24, 26</a>. 
</blockquote>
<p>Here it is evident that 'the plant', a term used for what the field produces, means the Church's truth, and 'the tares' falsity. 
The parable is, it is true, a comparison; but all comparisons in the Word are based on things that have a spiritual meaning, <a href="3579.htm">3579</a>. In David, </p>
<blockquote>
He causes the grass to grow for the beast, and the plant 
for man's service, that he may bring forth bread from the earth. <a href="http://bible.gospelcom.net/cgi-bin/bible?passage=Ps%20104:14&amp;version=ESV&amp;interface=print&amp;showfn=yes&amp;showxref">Ps 104:14</a>.  
</blockquote>
<p>'The plant', a term used here also for what the field produces, in the internal sense means truth. </p>
<p></p>
<p><b>[2]</b>
 In the same 
author,  </p>
<blockquote>
He will make me lie down in pastures of the plant;<A name="fntext1"></a><A href="#fn1"><sup>a</sup></a> He will lead me to still waters; He will restore my soul <a href="http://bible.gospelcom.net/cgi-bin/bible?passage=Ps%2023:2,%203&amp;version=ESV&amp;interface=print&amp;showfn=yes&amp;showxref">Ps 23:2, 3</a>. 
</blockquote>
<p>'Pastures of the plant' stands for spiritual nourishment, nourishment 
of the soul. That is why it says 'He will restore my soul'. In Isaiah, </p>
<blockquote>
The waters of Nimrim will be desolations, for the reason that the grass has withered away, the plant has been consumed, 
there is nothing green. [<a href="http://bible.gospelcom.net/cgi-bin/bible?passage=Isa%2015:6&amp;version=ESV&amp;interface=print&amp;showfn=yes&amp;showxref">Isa 15:6</a>. 
</blockquote>
<p>In the same prophet, </p>
<blockquote>
The inhabitants became plants of the field and edible grass, hay on the rooftops, and scorched earth before standing corn.] <a href="http://bible.gospelcom.net/cgi-bin/bible?passage=Isa%2037:17&amp;version=ESV&amp;interface=print&amp;showfn=yes&amp;showxref">Isa 37:17</a>. 
</blockquote>
<p>In 
the same prophet, </p>
<blockquote>
I will lay waste mountains and hills, and dry up every plant on them; and I will make streams into islands. And I will lead the blind in a way they do not know. <a href="http://bible.gospelcom.net/cgi-bin/bible?passage=Isa%2042:15,%2016&amp;version=ESV&amp;interface=print&amp;showfn=yes&amp;showxref">Isa 42:15, 16</a>. 
</blockquote>
<p>In Jeremiah, </p>
<blockquote>
How long will the land mourn and the plant of every field wither, on account of the wickedness of those who dwell in it? The beasts and the birds will be devoured. <a href="http://bible.gospelcom.net/cgi-bin/bible?passage=Jer%2012:4&amp;version=ESV&amp;interface=print&amp;showfn=yes&amp;showxref">Jer 12:4</a>. 
</blockquote>
<p>In 
the same prophet, </p>
<blockquote>
The hind in the field calved but left because there was no plant; and the wild asses stood on the hills, they gulped the wind like sea-monsters, for the reason that there 
was no plant. <a href="http://bible.gospelcom.net/cgi-bin/bible?passage=Jer%2014:5,%206&amp;version=ESV&amp;interface=print&amp;showfn=yes&amp;showxref">Jer 14:5, 6</a>. 
</blockquote>
<p>In Joel, </p>
<blockquote>
Fear not, you beasts of My fields, for the dwelling-places of the wilderness have become abounding in plants; for the tree will bear its fruit, the fig tree 
and the vine will give their full yield <a href="http://bible.gospelcom.net/cgi-bin/bible?passage=Joel%201:12&amp;version=ESV&amp;interface=print&amp;showfn=yes&amp;showxref">Joel 1:12</a>. 
</blockquote>
<p>In Amos, </p>
<blockquote>
When the locust had finished eating the plant of the land, I said, O Lord Jehovih, Pardon, I beg You. How will Jacob stand? for he is 
small. <a href="http://bible.gospelcom.net/cgi-bin/bible?passage=Amos%207:2&amp;version=ESV&amp;interface=print&amp;showfn=yes&amp;showxref">Amos 7:2</a>. 
</blockquote>
<p></p>
<p><b>[3]</b>
 In Zechariah, </p>
<blockquote>
Ask rain from Jehovah in the time of the latter rain.<A name="fntext2"></a><A href="#fn2"><sup>b</sup></a> Jehovah will make rain-clouds, and will give them rain in showers, to everyone plants in his field.<A name="fntext3"></a><A href="#fn3"><sup>c</sup></a>

</blockquote>
<p>In John, </p>
<blockquote>
The fifth angel sounded and it was declared that they should not harm the grass of the earth, or any green thing, or any tree. <a href="http://bible.gospelcom.net/cgi-bin/bible?passage=Rev%209:4&amp;version=ESV&amp;interface=print&amp;showfn=yes&amp;showxref">Rev 9:4</a>. 
</blockquote>
<p>Anyone may see that in these places 
'grass' is not meant, nor 'plant', but instead the kinds of things that belong to the Church; 'the plant of the land' and 'plant of the field' are, it is plain, used to mean the truth of faith. Without 
such a spiritual sense no one would ever know what is meant in John by their declaring, when the fifth angel sounded, that they should not harm the grass of the earth, or any green thing. Nor would 
anyone know what is meant in Jeremiah when it says that 'the hind in the field calved and left because there was no plant; and the wild asses gulped the wind like sea-monsters, for the reason that 
there was no plant'. And in very many other places no one would know what is meant. This shows how little understanding there is of the Word, and how earthly a person's conception of very many things 
in it must be unless he knows what their spiritual meaning is, or at least knows that in every detail the Word is holy.

`Et super omnem herbam agri in terra Aegypti': quod significet omne verum Ecclesiae in mente naturali, constat ex significatione `herbae' quod sit verum, de qua sequitur; ex significatione `agri' quod 
sit Ecclesia, de qua supra n. 7557; et ex significatione `terrae Aegypti' quod sit mens naturalis, de qua etiam supra n. 7569.  Quod `herba' significet verum, est quia `terra' significat Ecclesiam, 
tum quoque `ager'; omnis proventus inde significat vel verum quod fidei vel bonum quod charitatis, nam haec sunt Ecclesiae; per `herbam agri' intelligitur (d)omne in genere quod provenit ex agro, ut 
patet a parabola Domini apud Matthaeum, Simile factum est regnum caelorum homini seminanti bonum semen in agro suo, cum germinavit herba et fructum fecit, tunc apparuerunt zizania, xiii 24, 26; </p>
<p>ibi 
`herba' pro proventu agri; quod per `herbam' ibi significetur verum Ecclesiae, et per `zizania' falsum, patet; est quidem comparatio, sed omnes comparationes in Verbo sunt ex significativis, n. 3579 apud 
Davidem, Qui germinare facit gramen bestiae, et herbam in ministerium hominis, ad educendum panem e terra, Ps. civ 14; </p>
<p>hic quoque `herba' pro proventu agri, et per illam in sensu interno ibi significatur 
verum: apud eundem, 2 In pascuis herbae cubare faciet me, ad aquas quietum deducet me, animam meam recreabit, Ps. xxiii 2 [,3]; </p>
<p>`pascua herbae' pro nutricione spirituali, quae est animae, 
quare dicitur `animam meam recreabit': apud Esaiam, Aquae Nimrim desolationes erunt, eo quod exaruit gramen, consumpta est herba, viride non est, {1}[xv 6: </p>
<p>apud eundem, Habitatores facti sunt herba 
agri, et olus graminis, faenum tectorum, et arvum adustum ante segetem stantem,] xxxvii 27: </p>
<p>apud eundem, Vastabo montes et colles et omnem herbam eorum arefaciam, et ponam fluvios in insulas; {2} et 
ducam caecos in via quam non noverunt, xiii 15 [,16]: </p>
<p>apud Jeremiam, Quousque lugebit terra, et herba omnis agri exarescet; propter malitiam habitantium in ea consumentur bestiae et avis, xii 4: </p>
<p>apud 
eandem, Cerva in agro peperit, sed relinquendo, quia non fuit herba: et onagri steterunt super collibus, anhelarunt ventum sicut ceti, {3} eo quod non herba, xiv 5, 6: </p>
<p>apud Joelem, Ne timete, 
bestiae agrorum Meorum, quia herbosa facta sunt habitacula deserti, quia arbor feret fructum suum, ficus atque vitis {4}dabunt vim suam, ii 22: </p>
<p>apud Amos, Quando locusta consumavit comedere herbam terrae, 
dixi, Domine Jehovih, condona quaeso, qualis stabit Jacob, cum parvus ille? vii 2: </p>
<p>apud Sachariam, 3 Petite a Jehovah pluviam in tempore serotinam; Jehovah faciet nimbos, et pluviam imbris dabit

<p>apud Johannem, Quintus angelus clanxit et dictum ut damno non afficerent gramen terrae, neque ullum viride, neque ullam arborem, Apoc. ix 4. Quisque videre potest 
quod in his locis non `gramen' nec `herba' intelligantur, sed pro illis talia quae Ecclesiae sunt; quod per `herbam terrae' et `herbam agri' intelligatur verum quod fidei, patet.  Absque sensu tali
