<h3 align="center" class="ired">属天的奥秘 第712节</h3>
<h4 align="center"></h4><p><strong>712.</strong>“因为在这世代中，我见你在我面前是义人”表示拥有他能借以被重生的良善。这一点在前一章第9节已予以阐明。在那里，“义”表示仁之善，而且“后代”用的是复数，因为所阐述的是觉知之物，但此处“后代”用的是单数，因为所阐述的是意愿之物。意愿包含觉知之物，但觉知并不包含意愿之物。</p>

<p><strong>[NCE]712.</strong> Because I have seen you as a just person in this generation means having a good quality that makes regeneration possible, as was explained and demonstrated at <a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_712/bible_king-james-version_genesis_6_9" target=_top>Genesis 6:9</a> [<a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_712/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_612" target=_top>612-615</a>]. There, the word just had to do with the good involved in charity, and upright, with the truth involved in it. There, generations was plural because the realm of the intellect was the theme, but here the word is singular because the realm of the will is the theme. The will encloses intellectual things in its embrace, whereas the intellect does not enclose volitional ones. </p>
<p align="center"><b>Potts(1905-1910) 712</b></p><p><b>712.</b>
For thee have I seen righteous in this generation. That this signifies that he had good whereby he might be regenerated, was stated and shown at the ninth verse of the preceding chapter. In that place 
"righteous" or "just" signifies the good of charity; and "perfect" the truth of charity. It is there said "generations" in the plural, because things of the understanding are treated of; and here, "generation" 
in the singular, because things of the will are treated of. For the will comprehends in itself the things of the understanding, but the understanding does not comprehend in itself those of the will. </p>

<p align="center"><b>Elliott(1983-1999) 712</b></p><p><b>712.</b>
'For I have seen you to be a righteous man in this generation means possessing good by which he could be regenerated. This has been stated and shown at verse g of the previous chapter. There 'righteous' 
means the good which belongs to charity, and 'upright' the truth which belongs to it. There they were 'generations' because things of the understanding were the subject, but here it is 'a generation' 
because those of the will are the subject. For the will embraces things of the understanding, but the understanding does not embrace those of the will. </p>

<p align="center"><b>Latin(1748-1756) 712</b>
</p><b>712.</b>
'Quia te vidi justum in generatione hac': quod significet bonum habere, per quod regenerari posset, cap. praec. ad vers. 9 dictam et ostensum est; ibi 'justus' significat bonum charitatis,, et 'integer' 
verum charitatis: ibi 'generationes,' quia de intellectualibus; hic 'generatio,' quia de voluntariis; voluntas enim comprehendit in se intellectualia, non intellectus voluntaria. </p>
