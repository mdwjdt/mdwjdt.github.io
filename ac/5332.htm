<h3 align="center" class="ired">属天的奥秘 第5332节</h3>
<h4 align="center"></h4><p><strong>5332.</strong>“又将安城的祭司波提非拉的女儿亚西纳给他为妻”表真理与良善并良善与真理的婚姻的本质。这从“给为妻”的含义清楚可知，“给为妻”是指婚姻。之所以表示良善与真理，并真理与良善的婚姻，是因为就灵义而言，“婚姻”并非表示其它东西，因而在圣言中，“婚姻”并非表示其它东西。“安城祭司的女儿”表示良善之真理，因为“女儿”表示对真理的情感，“祭司”是指良善；但“约瑟”是指拥有神性在里面的真理之良善，与属灵层的属天层是一样的。由此明显可知，所表示的是真理与良善并良善与真理的婚姻。其实所表示的是该婚姻的本质；但该本质没能得到进一步的解释，因为主在世时所拥有的本质超出一切理解力，甚至超出天使的理解力。从存在于天堂中的那类事物，如从大人，从由于主神性的流注而存在于那里的属灵层的属天层只能对它形成一个模糊的观念。但与光本身而言，该观念就像最黑暗的阴影，因为它们的确是最笼统的观念，因而相对于它所描述的实体，几乎什么比不是。</p>

And he gave him Asenath the daughter of Potiphera priest of On for a woman. That this signifies the quality of the marriage of truth with good and of good with truth, is evident from the signification 
of "giving for a woman," as being marriage. That it is the marriage of good with truth and of truth with good, is because nothing else is meant in the spiritual sense by marriages, and hence nothing 
else is meant by them in the Word. By the "daughter of the priest of On" is signified the truth of good, for a "daughter" is the affection of truth, and a "priest" is good; but "Joseph" is the good of 
truth in which is the Divine, which is the same as the celestial of the spiritual. From this it is plain that the marriage of truth with good and of good with truth is signified. It is the quality of 
this marriage that is signified, but this quality cannot be further set forth, because the quality the Lord had in the world cannot be comprehended, even by angels, and only some shadowy idea can be 
formed of it from such things as are in heaven-as from the Grand Man, and from the celestial of the spiritual which is therein from the influx of the Lord's Divine; but still this idea is as dense shade 
to light itself, for it is most general, and relatively is therefore scarcely anything. </p>

'And gave him Asenath, the daughter of Potiphera the priest of On, for a wife' means the essential nature of the marriage of truth to good, and of good to truth. This is clear from the meaning of 'giving 
for a wife' as a marriage. The reason the marriage of good to truth, and of truth to good, is meant is that nothing else is understood in a spiritual sense by 'marriages', and therefore nothing else 
is understood by 'marriages' in the Word. 'The daughter of the priest of On' means the truth of good, since 'a daughter' is the affection for truth and 'a priest' is good; but 'Joseph' is the good 
of truth that has the Divine within it, which is the same as the celestial of the spiritual. From this it is evident that the marriage of truth to good, and of good to truth, is meant. What is actually 
meant is the essential nature of this marriage; but this cannot receive any further explanation because the essential nature of what was the Lord's when He was in the world is beyond all understanding, 
beyond even that of angels. Just a vague idea of it can be formed from the kinds of things that exist in heaven - from the Grand Man and from the celestial of the spiritual existing there as a result 
of the influx of the Lord's Divine. But that idea is like the darkest shade compared with the light itself; for it is a very general idea indeed, thus scarcely anything compared with the reality 
it describes. </p>

`Et dedit ei Asenath filiam Potipherae sacerdotis On in mulierem': quod significet quale conjugii veri cum bono, ac boni cum vero, constat ex significatione `dare in mulierem' quod sit conjugium; quod 
sit conjugium boni cum vero, et veri cum bono, est quia non aliud per conjugia in sensu spirituali intelligitur, et inde nec aliud per `conjugia' in Verbo. Per `filiam sacerdotis On' significatur verum 
boni, `filia' enim est affectio veri, et `sacerdos' est bonum, {1}'Josephus' autem est bonum veri in quo Divinum, quod idem est cum caelesti spiritualis; inde patet quod significetur conjugium veri 
cum bono, (c)ac boni cum vero. Quale hujus conjugii est quod significatur, sed quale hoc non potest amplius exponi quia quale quod fuit Domino in mundo non potest comprehendi, ne quidem ab angelis, 
solum aliqua idea umbratilis de eo formari (c)ex talibus quae in caelo sunt, ut a Maximo Homine, et a caelesti spiritualis quod ibi ex influxu Divini Domini; sed usque idea illa est sicut crassa umbra 
ad ipsam lucem, nam est communissima, ita vix aliquid respective. @1 per Josephum repraesentatur$ </p>
