<h4 align="center"></h4><p><strong>2409．创世记19:16.</strong> 但罗得迟延不走。二人因为耶和华怜恤罗得，就拉着他的手和他妻子的手，并他两个女儿的手，把他们领出来，安置在城外。<br />“他迟延不走”表由邪恶的本质所导致的不情愿。“二人就拉着他的手和他妻子的手，并他两个女儿的手”表主强有力地拦阻他们，使他们远离邪恶，从而在“罗得”、“他的妻子”和“他女儿”所表示的善与真中得以强化。“因为耶和华怜恤罗得”表出于恩典和怜悯。“把他们领出来，安置在城外”表那时他的状态。</p>

Verse 16. And he lingered; and the men laid hold of his hand, and of the hand of his wife, and of the hand of his two daughters; in the clemency of Jehovah upon him, and they led him forth, and set him 
without the city. "And he lingered," signifies opposition arising from the nature of evil; "and the men laid hold of his hand, and of the hand of his wife, and of the hand of his two daughters," signifies 
that the Lord powerfully withheld them from evils, and thereby strengthened the goods and truths signified by "Lot," his "wife," and his "daughters;" "in the clemency of Jehovah upon him," signifies 
from grace and mercy; "and they led him forth and set him without the city," signifies his state then. </p>

Verse 16 And he lingered; and the men grasped his hand, and his wife's hand, and his daughters' hands, because of Jehovah's compassion for him, and they led him away, and placed him outside the city. </p>
<p>'And 
he fingered' means reluctance caused by the nature of evil. 'And the men grasped his hand, and his wife's hand, and his daughters' hands' means that the Lord withheld him powerfully from evils 
and in so doing strengthened goods and truths meant by 'Lot, his wife, and his daughters'. 'Because of Jehovah's compassion for him' means out of grace and mercy. 'And they led him away, and placed 
him outside the city' means his state at that time. </p>

Vers. 16.  Et moratus, et apprehenderunt viri manum ejus, et manum uxoris ejus, et manum duarum filiarum ejus, in clementia Jehovae super eum, et eduxerunt eum, et statuerunt eum extra urbem. `Et moratus' 
significat repugnantiam a natura mali: `et apprehenderunt viri manum ejus, et manum uxoris ejus, et manum duarum filiarum ejus' significat quod Dominus potenter detinuerit a malis, et sic corroboraverit 
bona et vera significata per `Lotum, uxorem, et filias ejus': `in clementia Jehovae super eum' significat ex gratia et misericordia: `et eduxerunt eum, et statuerunt extra urbem' significat 
statum ejus tunc. </p>
