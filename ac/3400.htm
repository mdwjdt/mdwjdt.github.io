<h3 align="center" class="ired">属天的奥秘 第3400节</h3>
<h4 align="center"></h4><p><strong>3400.</strong>“罪过”表违反良善与真理的过犯和罪恶的罪责或归罪。这从圣言中提及并描述罪（guilt）的经文清楚可知，如以赛亚书：<br />耶和华却喜悦将祂压伤，使祂有瑕疵。若你使祂的性命作赎罪祭，祂必看见祂的种，并且延长祂的时日，耶和华所喜悦的事必在祂手中亨通。（以赛亚书<a href="http://39-27.cn/赛53.10.htm">53:10</a>）<br />这论及主。“使祂的性命作赎罪（guilt）祭”表被归因于祂的罪，因而表被那些恨祂之人施加在祂身上的罪责。不是祂给自己染上什么罪，而是祂要担当罪。以西结书：<br />你因流了人的血，就为有罪，你做了偶像，就玷污自己。（以西结书<a href="http://39-27.cn/结22.4.htm">22:4</a>）<br />“流了人的血”表向良善施暴（<a href="374.htm">374</a>，<a href="376.htm">376</a>，<a href="1005.htm">1005</a>节），罪过由此而来。诗篇：<br />恨恶义人的，必被定罪！耶和华救赎祂仆人的灵魂，凡投靠他的，必不至定罪！（诗篇<a href="http://39-27.cn/诗34.21.htm">34:21</a>-<a href="http://39-27.cn/诗34.22.htm">22</a>）<br />因此，“罪过”表一切存留的罪恶。主藉着良善将它分离出去就是“救赎”，这也由祭司献赎愆祭的时候所行的赎罪祭来代表，如我们在利未记（<a href="http://39-27.cn/利5.1.htm">5:1</a>-<a href="http://39-27.cn/利5.26.htm">26</a>；<a href="http://39-27.cn/利6.1.htm">6:1</a>-<a href="http://39-27.cn/利6.7.htm">7</a>；<a href="http://39-27.cn/利7.1.htm">7:1</a>-<a href="http://39-27.cn/利7.10.htm">10</a>；<a href="http://39-27.cn/利19.20.htm">19:20</a>-<a href="http://39-27.cn/利19.22.htm">22</a>）和民数记（<a href="http://39-27.cn/民5.1.htm">5:1</a>-<a href="http://39-27.cn/民5.8.htm">8</a>）中所读到的；那里还列举了罪的种类，就是如下这些罪：听见发咒语的声音，却不说出来；摸了不洁的物；发誓要行恶；在耶和华的圣物上误犯了罪；行了所吩咐不可行的什么事；拒绝归还邻舍交付给他的物；捡了遗失的物不承认，说谎起誓；与许配了男人、还没有被赎、得释放的婢女同寝；犯了人所常犯的罪，以致干犯耶和华。 </p>

<p align="center"><b>Potts(1905-1910) 3400</b></p><p><b>3400.</b>
That "guilt" denotes the blame or imputation of sin and of transgression against good and truth, is evident from the passages of the Word where "guilt" is mentioned and also described, as in Isaiah: </p>
<p> 
    It pleased Jehovah to bruise Him, and He hath made Him weak if thou shalt make His soul guilt, He shall see His seed, He shall prolong His days, and the will of Jehovah shall prosper through His 
hand (Isa. 53:10); </p>
<p>where the Lord is treated of; to "make His soul guilt" denotes sin imputed to Him, thus blame by those who hated Him; and not that in Himself He contracted anything of sin, that He 
should take it away. In Ezekiel: </p>
<p>     Thou art become guilty through thy blood that thou hast shed, and art defiled in thine idols which thou hast made (Ezek. 22:4); </p>
<p>where "shedding blood" signifies 
offering violence to good (n. 374, 376, 1005), whence comes guilt. In David: </p>
<p>     They that hate the righteous shall have guilt; Jehovah redeemeth the soul of His servants and none of them that trust 
in Him shall have guilt (Ps. 34:21-22). Thus "guilt" denotes all sin which remains; its separation by good from the Lord is "redemption," which was also represented by the expiation made by the priest 
when they offered the sacrifice of guilt; as we read in Lev. 6:1-26; 7:1-10; 19:20-22; Num. 5:1-8; where also the kinds of guilt are enumerated, which are as follows: hearing the voice of cursing 
and not declaring it; touching anything unclean; swearing to do evil; sinning by mistake concerning the holy things of Jehovah; doing any of those things which are forbidden by the commandments; refusing 
to a neighbor that which was to be kept for him; finding what has been lost, and denying it and swearing to a lie; lying with a woman that is a bondmaid betrothed to a man, not redeemed, neither 
made free; and all sins committed against a man by committing a trespass against Jehovah. </p>

<p align="center"><b>Elliott(1983-1999) 3400</b></p><p><b>3400.</b>
The fact that 'guilt' means blame or imputation of sin and of transgression against good and truth becomes clear from those places in the Word where 'guilt' is mentioned and also described, as in Isaiah, </p>
<blockquote>
Jehovah 
was willing to bruise Him and make Him imperfect. If You make His soul [full of] guilt, He will see His seed, He will prolong His days, and the will of Jehovah will prosper by His hand. 
<a href="http://bible.gospelcom.net/cgi-bin/bible?passage=Isa%2053:10&amp;version=ESV&amp;interface=print&amp;showfn=yes&amp;showxref">Isa 53:10</a>. 
</blockquote>
<p>This refers to the Lord. 'Making His soul [full of] guilt' stands for sin imputed to Him and so for blame laid on Him by those who hated Him. Not that He drew any sin at all to Himself 
to bear it away. In Ezekiel, </p>
<blockquote>
By the blood which you have shed, you have been held guilty,<A name="fntext1"></a><A href="#fn1"><sup>a</sup></a> and by your idols which you have made you are defiled. <a href="http://bible.gospelcom.net/cgi-bin/bible?passage=Ezek%2022:4&amp;version=ESV&amp;interface=print&amp;showfn=yes&amp;showxref">Ezek 22:4</a>. 
</blockquote>
<p>'Shedding blood' stands for doing violence 
to good, <a href="374.htm">374</a>, <a href="376.htm">376</a>, <a href="1005.htm">1005</a>, leading to guilt In David, </p>
<blockquote>
Those who hate the righteous will he held guilty.<A name="fntext2"></a><A href="#fn2"><sup>b</sup></a> Jehovah redeems the soul of His servants, nor will all who trust in Him be held guilty.<A name="fntext2"></a><A href="#fn2"><sup>b</sup></a> 
<a href="http://bible.gospelcom.net/cgi-bin/bible?passage=Ps%2034:21,%2022&amp;version=ESV&amp;interface=print&amp;showfn=yes&amp;showxref">Ps 34:21, 22</a>. 
</blockquote>
<p></p>

 'Guilt' accordingly stands for all sin that remains. The separation of it by means of good from the Lord is redemption, which was also represented by the atonement made by the 
priest when people offered the guilt-offering, dealt with in <a href="http://bible.gospelcom.net/cgi-bin/bible?passage=Lev%205:1-19;%206:1-7;%207:1-10;%2019:20-22&amp;version=ESV&amp;interface=print&amp;showfn=yes&amp;showxref">Lev 5:1-19; 6:1-7; 7:1-10; 19:20-22</a>; <a href="http://bible.gospelcom.net/cgi-bin/bible?passage=Num%205:1-8&amp;version=ESV&amp;interface=print&amp;showfn=yes&amp;showxref">Num 5:1-8</a>, where also types of guilt are listed, namely these: When people have heard a curse uttered 
but do not say they have heard it: When they have touched something unclean: When they have sworn to do evil: When they have sinned unintentionally against holy things that are Jehovah's: When they 
have done one of the things which they are commanded not to do: When they have refused to return to somebody his deposit: When they deny that they have found something that was lost, and have sworn 
falsely: When they have lain with a woman who is a slave, betrothed to another man, and not yet redeemed or made free: When they have committed any sin against another person by transgressing against 
Jehovah.

Quod `reatus' sit culpa seu imputatio peccati et praevaricationis contra bonum et verum, constare potest ab illis locis in Verbo ubi reatus nominatur, et quoque describitur; ut apud Esaiam,        
   Jehovah {1}velit conterere Illum, et infirmavit; si      posueris reatum animam Suam, videbit semen, prolongabit dies,      et voluntas Jehovae per manum Ipsius prosperabitur, liii. 10; </p>
<p>de Domino: 
`ponere reatum animam Suam' pro peccato Ipsi imputato, ita pro culpa ab osoribus; non quod in se peccati aliquid derivaverit, ut auferret: apud Ezechielem,           Per sanguinem quem effudisti, 
reatum habuisti, et per      idola tua, quae fecisti, polluta es, xxii 4: </p>
<p>`effundere sanguinem' pro violentiam inferre bono, n. 374, 376, 1005, inde reatus: apud Davidem,           Osores justi reatum 
habebunt, redimens Jehovah animam      servorum Suorum; nec reatum habebunt, omnes confidentes Ipsi,      Ps. xxxiv 22, 23 [A.V. 21, 22]; </p>
<p>ita `reatus' pro omni peccato quod manet; [2] ejus separatio 
per bonum a Domino, est redemptio, quae repraesentata {2}quoque est per expiationem a sacerdote, quando obtulerunt sacrificium reatus, de quibus Lev. v 1-26 [A.V. v 1-19; vi 1-7]; vii 1-10; xix 
20-22; Num. v 1-8, ubi etiam recensentur genera reatus, {3}quae sunt quod audiverint vocem maledictionis et non indicaverint: quod tetigerint immundum quodcumque: quod juraverint ad faciendum malum: quod 
peccaverint per errorem de sanctis Jehovae: quod fecerint unum de praeceptis quae non fieri debent: quod negaverint proximo suum depositum: quod invenerint amissum, et negaverint juraverintque in 
mendacio: quod cubuerint cum muliere quae ancilla mancipata viro, non redempta, nec manumissa: quod fecerint de omnibus peccatis contra hominem, praevaricando praevaricationem contra Jehovam. @1 Most
