<h3 align="center" class="ired">属天的奥秘 第4269节</h3>
<h4 align="center"></h4><p><strong>4269.</strong>“并且你们要说，看哪，你仆人雅各在我们后边。因雅各说，我借着在我前头去的礼物给他面子，然后再见他的面，或者他会让我的脸抬得起”表为接下来的事所做的预备；“于是礼物在他前面过去了”表生效；“那夜，雅各在营中过夜”表随后发生的事。这些含义从内义上的每句话清楚可知，显然，这些话与为得到友好接待而做好预备有关。但要将每句话都解释清楚是不可能的，因为只要某个事物的总体方面不得而知，那么该事物的各个细节就无法进入光明，只能陷入纯粹的昏暗。必须先有大体的概念，否则，各个细节就无处可去。它们若去往纯粹昏暗存在之处，就无法被看到；若去往虚假所在之处，则要么被弃绝，要么被窒息，要么被败坏；若去往邪恶所在之处，就会遭到嘲笑。能接受真理的这些一般方面就足够了，即：人必须重生才能进入主的国度（约翰福音<a href="http://39-27.cn/约3.3.htm">3:3</a>）；在他经历重生之前，真理看似占据第一位，良善占据第二位；但当他经历重生时，次序就会颠倒过来，良善占据第一位，真理占据第二位；还有，当次序颠倒过来时，主就在属世人或外在人里面按次序整理和排列它们，以便真理在那里能被良善接受，并服从于良善，好叫此人不再出于真理，而是出于良善，也就是仁爱行事；而且，当照着信之真理生活，并为了生活的缘故而热爱教义时，他便出于仁爱行事。此处涉及真理的有序排列，引入良善和在良善面前的交付的这些事就是内义的内容，而成就这些事的过程在清晰的光明中显现在天使面前；因为这类事属于天使的智慧，尽管世人对此一无所见。尽管如此，那些出于简单的信仰而处于简单良善的人仍有能力知道这些话。即便活在肉身时由于世俗的挂虑和由此导致的粗糙观念而不明白，但他们在除去世俗和肉体事物后的来世仍能明白；因为到那时，他们会接受光明，进入天使的聪明和智慧。</p>

And ye shall also say, Behold thy servant Jacob is behind us; for he said, I will expiate his faces in a present that goeth before me, and afterward I will see his faces; peradventure he will lift up 
my faces. That this signifies preparation for what follows, and that the present passed over before him signifies the effect, and also that he passed the night in that night in the camp signifies the 
things which follow, is evident from the several words in the internal sense, which manifestly imply preparation for his being kindly received. But how the case is with the particulars, cannot be unfolded 
to the apprehension, for so long as the generals are not known, the singulars of the same subject cannot fall into any light, but into mere shade. General notions must precede; and unless there 
are these, the singulars find no hospice where they may enter. In a hospice where there is mere shade, they are not seen; and in a hospice where there are falsities, they are either rejected, or suffocated, 
or perverted; and where there are evils, they are derided. It is sufficient that there be received these generals -that man must be regenerated before he can enter into the Lord's kingdom (John 
3:3); that until he is being regenerated, truth is apparently in the first place and good in the second; but that when he is being regenerated the order is inverted, and good is in the first place and 
truth in the second; also, that when the order is being inverted, the Lord so disposes and arranges in order in the natural or external man, that truth is there received by good, and submits itself 
to good, so that the man no longer acts from truth, but from good (that is, from charity); and further, that he acts from charity when he lives according to the truths of faith, and loves doctrine for 
the sake of life. The process of these things which are here contained in the internal sense in regard to the orderly arrangement, initiation, and submission of truth before good, appears before the 
angels in clear light; for such things are of angelic wisdom, although man sees nothing of them. Nevertheless they who are in simple good from simple faith are in the faculty of knowing these things; 
and if on account of worldly cares and gross ideas arising therefrom they do not apprehend them in the life of the body, they nevertheless do so in the other life, where worldly and bodily things are 
removed; for they are then enlightened and come into angelic intelligence and wisdom. </p>

'And you shall also say, Behold, your servant Jacob is behind us. For he said, I will appease him with the gift that is going in front of me, and after that I will see his face; perhaps he will accept 
me' means preparation for what follows; 'and the gift passed over in front of him' means being carried into effect; also 'he spent that night in the camp' means the things which follow. These meanings 
become clear from each individual word in the internal sense, which, it is evident, has to do with making preparation to gain a friendly reception. But each individual word cannot be explained intelligibly, 
for as long as the general aspects of something are not known the individual details of that same thing cannot install themselves where there is any light, only where total shade exists. General 
conceptions come first, and unless they do, individual details do not have anywhere to go. If they go where total shade exists they are not seen; if they go where falsities reign they are either 
rejected or smothered or perverted; and if they go where evils reign they are ridiculed. It is enough that those general aspects of truth are received, which are these: A person must be regenerated before 
he can enter the Lord's kingdom, <a href="http://bible.gospelcom.net/cgi-bin/bible?passage=John%203:3&amp;version=ESV&amp;interface=print&amp;showfn=yes&amp;showxref">John 3:3</a>; before he undergoes regeneration truth seemingly occupies the first position and good the second, but when he does undergo it order becomes turned around 
and good comes to occupy the first position and truth the second; also when order is turned around the Lord deploys and arranges them into order within the natural or external man in such a way that 
truth is there received by good and truth submits itself to good, with the result that truth is no longer the basis of the person's action but good, that is, charity; also charity is the basis of his 
action when he leads a life in keeping with the truths of faith and loves what is taught for the sake of that life. The process by which these things are effected - things which have to do with the arrangement 
of truth into order, its introduction to good, and its submission in the presence of good, and which are the content of the internal sense here - can be seen by angels in clear light; for such 
matters belong to angelic wisdom, although man sees nothing of those matters Nevertheless those who are governed by simple good arising out of simple faith have the capacity to know them. If they 
do not come to know them during the life of the body on account of worldly cares and resulting naive ideas, they do so in the next life when worldly and bodily concerns have been removed; for in that 
case they receive light and enter into angelic intelligence and wisdom. </p>

`Et dicetis etiam, Ecce servus tuus Jacob post nos; quia dixit, Expiabo facies ejus in munere eunte ante me, et postea videbo facies ejus, forte suscipiet facies meas': quod significet praeparationem 
ad sequentia; `et transivit munus ante eum': quod significet effectum; tum `pernoctavit in nocte illa in castris': </p>
<p>quod significet illa quae sequuntur, constare {1} potest ex singulis verbis in 
sensu interno, quae quod sint praeparationis ut benigne recipiatur, patet.  Sed singula quomodo se habent, non explicari possunt {2} ad captum, nam quamdiu communia non nota sunt, singularia ejusdem 
rei non possunt in aliquam lucem sed in meram umbram cadere; communes notiones praecedent, quae nisi sunt, singularia non habent aliquod hospitium quo intrent; in hospitio ubi mera umbra, non apparent, 
et in hospitio ubi falsa, vel rejiciuntur vel suffocantur vel pervertuntur, ac ubi mala, ibi irridentur; satis est ut recipiantur haec communia, quod nempe (o)regenerandus sit homo, antequam 
intrare possit in regnum Domini, Joh. iii 3; quod priusquam regeneratur, verum primo loco apparenter sit {3}, et bonum secundo; at cum regeneratur, quod invertitur ordo, et bonum primo loco sit et 
verum secundo; tum quando invertitur ordo, quod Dominus disponat et ordinet ita in naturali seu externo homine ut verum ibi a bono recipiatur et ut verum se submittat bono, ita ut homo non amplius 
ex vero agat sed ex bono, hoc est, ex charitate; tum quod ex charitate {4} agat cum vivit secundum vera fidei ac doctrinam amat propter vitam; processus illarum rerum {5}, quae de ordinatione, initiatione 
et submissione veri coram bono, in sensu interno hic {6} continentur {7}, coram angelis in clara luce apparet, nam talia sunt sapientiae angelicae, tametsi homo nihil illarum rerum {5} videt; 
at usque qui in simplici bono sunt ex simplici fide, illi in facultate sunt sciendi illa, si non capiunt illa in vita corporis ob curas mundanas et crassas inde ideas, usque in altera vita, ubi 
mundana et corporea {8} remota sunt, nam tunc illustrantur ac in intelligentiam (c)et sapientiam angelicam veniunt.      @1 i etiam$      @2 i usque$      @3 i antequam regeneratur homo$      
@4 et quod tunc ex illis quae sunt charitatis$      @5 illius rei$      @6 before de ordinatione$      @7 continetur$      @8 talia$ </p>
