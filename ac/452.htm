<h3 align="center" class="ired">属天的奥秘 第452节</h3>
<h4 align="center"></h4><p><strong>452.</strong>有些精灵以为天堂与天堂之乐在于成为最大的，我与他们交谈过。不过，他们被告知，在天堂，最小的才是最大的，因为愿为最小者拥有最大的快乐，自然也是最大的，因为若非最快乐的，最大有何意义呢？拥有权力者利用他们的权力，拥有财富者利用他们的财富，所追求的不就是最大的快乐吗？他们还被告知，天堂也不在于做最小的，以求成为最大的，因为这时人真正渴求的还是成为最大的；真正的天堂乃是衷心祝愿别人比自己好，为他人的幸福乐意效犬马之劳，且不求回报，仅仅因为爱。</p>

<p><strong>[NCE]452.</strong> I spoke with some spirits who thought heaven and heavenly joy consisted in being greatest. But I told them that the greatest in heaven is the one who is least.{*1} Whoever wants to be least has the greatest happiness. Since the person with the greatest happiness is the person who is least, it follows that such a person is the greatest. What is being greatest if not being happiest? Happiness is what the powerful seek in power and what the rich seek in riches.<br />I added that heaven does not consist in the desire to be least for the purpose of being greatest, because then the hope and longing is to be greatest. Heaven is wishing better for others than for ourselves with all our heart and serving others for the sake of their own happiness, not for any selfish goal but for love.<br /><br /><strong>Footnotes:</strong><br />{*1} This is an allusion to <a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_452/bible_king-james-version_luke_22_26" target=_top>Luke 22:26</a>: "Let the greater among you be as the younger; and the one who rules be as the one who serves."

I have conversed with spirits who supposed heaven and heavenly joy to consist in being the greatest. But they were told that in heaven he is greatest who is least, because he who would be the least has 
the greatest happiness, and consequently is the greatest, for what is it to be the greatest except to be the most happy? it is this that the powerful seek by power, and the rich by riches. They were 
told, further, that heaven does not consist in desiring to be the least in order to be the greatest, for in that case the person is really aspiring and wishing to be the greatest; but that heaven consists 
in this, that from the heart we wish better for others than for ourselves, and desire to be of service to others in order to promote their happiness, and this for no selfish end, but from love. </p>

I have spoken to spirits who imagined that heaven and heavenly joy consisted in being the greatest. But they were told that in heaven that person is the greatest who is least, for anyone who wishes to 
be the least has the greatest happiness. And because the person who is least does have the greatest happiness, he is for that very reason the greatest. What does being the greatest mean but being the 
happiest of all? It is what the powerful look for in power, and the rich in riches. They were told as well that heaven does not consist in desiring to be least so that in the end one maybe the greatest, 
for when that is the case the impulse and desire is to be the greatest. Instead heaven consists in a heartfelt desire that things shall be better for others than for oneself and a desire to serve 
others and further their happiness, doing so with no selfish intention but out of love.

</p><b>452.</b>
Locutus cum spiritibus qui putabant caelum et gaudium caeleste in consistere ut maximi sint; sed dictum iis quod in caelo maximus sit qui minimus; nam qui minimus esse vult, maximam felicitatem habet; 
et quia maximam felicitatem habet qui minimus, sequitur inde quod sit maximi Quid est maximus esse nisi quam felicissimus? id quaerunt potentes per potentiam, et divites per divitias: et porro dictum 
quod non consistat caelum in eo ut desideret minimum esse propterea ut sit maximus, tunc enim spirat et cupit esse maximum; sed est quod ex corde aliis melius velit quam sibi, servire aliis eorum felicitatis 
gratia, ex nullo fine sui sed ex amore. </p>
