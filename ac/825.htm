<h3 align="center" class="ired">属天的奥秘 第825节</h3>
<h4 align="center"></h4><p><strong>825.</strong>在脚底的前方相当远的距离处，有一个被称为火坑（Gehenna）的地狱。在那里，无耻女人的全部乐趣就在于通奸。她们不但认为通奸是可容许的，还以之为荣，并伪装成各种高尚的样子勾引诚实和无辜之人。只见那里出现一种烈焰的火光，诸如大火灾弥漫到空中的那种。它还伴随着炽热，我得以通过脸上所感受到的从它发出的温暖而感觉到它。它散发出象骨头和头发燃烧时所发出的那种恶臭。这个地狱有时会变成可怕的蛇咬住她们，在这种时刻，她们求死而不能。从那里被放出来的一些女人来到我身边，说那里有一股炽烈的酷热。不过，当她们被允许靠近善灵的社群时，这种酷热就变成酷寒。然后，酷热与酷寒在她们身上交替进行，从一个极端走向另一个极端，她们由此受到痛苦的折磨。然而，她们处在炽热欲望的炎热中也是有间隔的。不过，正如所说过的，她们的状态会经历变化。</p>

<p><strong>[NCE]825.</strong> Level with the soles of the feet, in front and fairly far away, is a hell called Gehenna containing shameless women who centered all their pleasure on committing adultery. They regarded adultery as not just acceptable but honorable and lured the unblemished and innocent into it under various high-minded guises.<br />A sort of fiery glow appears there, like the one that a large conflagration would cast in the air. There is also a blast of heat, which I was able to feel through the warmth that spread from there to my face. And an odor drifts out that resembles the smell of singed bones and hair.<br />Sometimes this hell turns into a mass of loathsome snakes that bite the inhabitants. Once bitten they long for death, but they cannot die.<br />Some women released from the place came to me and said it was hot there. They reported that when they are allowed to approach a certain community of good spirits, the heat turns into intense cold. The temperature, they said, then fluctuates between extremes of blazing heat and freezing cold, which also tormented them miserably.<br />They have intervals during which they are aroused and aflame with lust; but conditions change for them, as noted. </p>

In the plane of the soles of the feet, at a considerable distance in front, there is a hell which is called Gehenna, where are shameless women who have placed all their delight in adulteries, and have 
regarded adulteries as not only permissible but honorable, and who under various pretenses of honorableness have allured the guileless and innocent to such things. A kind of fiery glow appears there, 
such as overcasts the sky from a great conflagration; and it is attended with fiery heat, as it was given me to feel by the warmth from it on my face; and there is a stench exhaled therefrom, as from 
burning bones and hair. Sometimes this hell is changed into direful serpents, which bite them; and then they long for death, but cannot die. Certain women released therefrom came to me and said there 
was a fiery heat there; but that when they are allowed to draw near to any society of good spirits the heat is changed to intense cold; and then burning heat and cold alternate with them, from one extreme 
to the other, by which they are miserably tormented. But yet they have their intervals during which they are in the heat of their fiery lust. But, as was said, their states vary. </p>

On a level with the soles of the feet, in front and at quite some distance, is a hell called Gehenna where there are shameless women who have centred all their joy in committing adultery, and have imagined 
committing adultery to be not only permissible but also honourable. And under the pretence of what is honourable they have seduced guiltless and innocent people into such practices. In that place 
a fiery glow appears like that which normally radiates from the sky when there is a great fire. It is a fierce heat too, which I have been allowed to feel through the warmth issuing from it on to my 
face. And it gives off a stench like that given off by burning bones and hair. This hell is sometimes changed into dreadful serpents that bite them, at which point they long to die, but cannot. Certain 
women released from that place came to me and talked of the fierce heat there. They said that when they are allowed to approach any community of good spirits that heat is converted into extreme cold, 
in which case they experience the alternating extremes of cold and heat, and in this way are tortured mercilessly. Nevertheless they have intervening periods in which they are obsessed with the passions 
of their fiery lust. But their states undergo change, as has been mentioned. </p>

</p><b>825.</b>
In plano plantarum pedis antrorsum ad satis multam distantiam est infernum quod vocatur Gehenna, ubi impudicae mulieres quae omne suum jucundum in adulteriis posuerunt, et adulteria non solum pro licitis 
sed etiam pro honestis reputarunt, ac insontes et innocentes sub varia specie honesti ad talia pellexerunt: apparet ibi sicut igneum quoddam, quale elucere solet in aere ab incendio magno; etiam 
aestus est, quod sentire datum per calorem inde effusum in faciem meam; estque fetor ut ex ustis quasi ossibus et crinibus qui inde exhalat. Infernum hoc quandoque mutatur in diros serpentes qui mordent 
eos; tunc mortem appetunt, sed non possunt mori.  Quaedam inde solutae ad me venientes dicebant quod ibi aestus sit, et cum iis permittitur approximare ad societatem quandam spirituum bonorum, quod 
aestus ille vertatur in frigus intensum, et tunc apud eas undulare igneum et frigidum ab uno extremo ad alterum, quo miserabiliter quoque torquentur.  Sed usque sua interstitia habent, intra quae in 
igneae suae libidinis oestro sunt; sed mutantur eorum status, ut dictum. </p>
