<h3 align="center" class="ired">属天的奥秘 第4029节</h3>
<h4 align="center"></h4><p><strong>4029.</strong>“每到先聚集起来的羊群发热配合的时候”表自发的事物。这从“发热”、“羊群”和“先聚集起来的”的含义清楚可知：“发热”是指一种强烈的渴望及其效果（<a href="4018.htm">4018</a>，<a href="4019.htm">4019</a>节）；“羊群”是指真理与良善，如前所述；“先聚集起来的”是指自发的事物。“先聚集起来的”是指自发的事物，这一点从内义的思路，以及这一事实明显可知：凡出于情感，尤其出于“发热”所表示的强烈渴望所做的事都是自发的，因此，本节两次提到“发热”；这一点还可从原文中这个词的衍生意义明显可知，即意思是通过至内在的爱联结起来。另外，此处论述的主题是真理与良善在属世层里面的结合，这种结合只能通过自发，也就是处于自由中的事物实现。由此可见，“每到先聚集起来的羊群发热配合的时候”或“凡先聚集起来的羊群发热配合之处”表示自发的，也就是出于自由，或也可说，出于最深切情感的真理与良善。人的自由感觉就包含与他的爱或情感相一致的一切事物（参看<a href="2870.htm">2870</a>节）；真理与良善的一切结合皆在自由中，无一在强迫下实现（<a href="2875.htm">2875</a>，<a href="3145.htm">3145</a>，<a href="3146.htm">3146</a>，<a href="3158.htm">3158</a>节）；所以，一切改造和重生都是通过自由实现的（<a href="1937.htm">1937</a>，<a href="1947.htm">1947</a>，<a href="2876.htm">2876</a>-<a href="2881.htm">2881</a>节）；如果这一切能通过强迫实现，那么所有人早就得救了（<a href="2881.htm">2881</a>节）。</p>

And it came to pass in every growing warm of the flock that came together first. That this signifies those things which were spontaneous, is evident from the signification of "growing warm," as being 
the ardor of affection and its effect (n. 4018, 4019); from the signification of "flock," as being truth and good (concerning which also above); and from the signification of "those that came together 
first," as being things spontaneous. That "those that came together first" signify things spontaneous, is evident from the connection of things in the internal sense, and also from the fact that whatever 
is from affection is spontaneous, especially that which is from the ardor of affection, which is signified by "growing warm," for which reason their growing warm is spoken of twice in this verse; 
and also from the derivation of the word in the original language, as meaning conjunction by the inmost of love. Moreover the conjunction of truth and good in the natural is here treated of, which is 
not effected except by what is spontaneous, that is, in freedom. This shows that "in every growing warm of the flock of those that came together first," or "in every growing warm of those of the flock 
that came together first," signifies truths and goods which are spontaneous or from freedom, or what is the same, those which are from the utmost affection. (That everything which is of love or affection 
is free, see n. 2870; also that all conjunction of truth and good takes place in freedom, and that there is no conjunction in what is compulsory, n. 2875, 3145, 3146, 3158; and therefore all reformation 
and regeneration are effected by means of freedom, n. 1937, 1947, 2876-2881; if this could be effected by means of what is compulsory, all would be saved, n. 2881.) </p>

'So it was, whenever those came on heat - those of the flock which came together first' means the things that were spontaneous. This is clear from the meaning of 'coming on heat' as an intense desire, 
and the effect that resulted from this, dealt with above in <a href="4018.htm">4018</a>, <a href="4019.htm">4019</a>; from the meaning of 'the flock' as truth and good, also dealt with above; and from the meaning of 'those coming together first' 
as things that are spontaneous. This meaning of 'those which came together first' - namely things that are spontaneous - is evident from the sequence of thought in the internal sense. It is in addition 
evident from the consideration that anything done from affection is spontaneous, very much so when done from an intense desire, meant by 'coming on heat'- hence the use twice in this verse of the 
expression 'coming on heat'. And the meaning of 'those which came together first' is still further evident from the derivation of this expression in the original language as becoming joined together through 
deepest love, as well as from the subject here being the joining of truth and good in the natural which is effected only through that which is spontaneous, that is, done in freedom. From all this 
it may be seen that 'whenever those came on heat - those of the flock which came together first' or 'wherever those from the flock which came together first came on heat' means truths and goods which 
are spontaneous, that is, which are the product of freedom, or what amounts to the same, of deepest affection. </p>
<p>A person's feeling of freedom involves everything that is in keeping with his love 
or affection, see <a href="2870.htm">2870</a>. </p>
<p>Every joining together of truth and good is effected in freedom and none under compulsion, <a href="2875.htm">2875</a>, <a href="3145.htm">3145</a>, <a href="3146.htm">3146</a>, <a href="3158.htm">3158</a>. </p>
<p>Consequently all reformation and regeneration is effected 
through freedom, <a href="1937.htm">1937</a>, <a href="1947.htm">1947</a>, <a href="2876.htm">2876</a>-<a href="2881.htm">2881</a>. </p>
<p>If it were possible to effect it through compulsion all would be saved, <a href="2881.htm">2881</a>. </p>

`Fuit in omni incalescere gregis primum coeuntium' quod significet illa quae spontanea essent, constat a significatione `incalescere' quod sit affectionis ardor et effectus, de qua supra n. 4018, 
4019; a significatione `gregis' quod sit verum et bonum, de qua etiam supra; et ex significatione `primum coeuntium' quod sint spontanea quod primum coeuntes sint spontanea, ex nexu rerum in sensu 
interno patet, tum ex eo quod quicquid est ex affectione, est spontaneum, et maxime quod ex affectionis ardore qui per `incalescere' significatur quare in hoc versu incalescere bis dicitur; ut et 
ex derivatione vocis illius in lingua originali quod sit conjunctio per intimum amoris, de conjunctione veri et boni in naturali hic agitur, quae non nisi qua: (o)per spontaneum, hoc (x)est, in libero 
fit; inde constare potest quod `in omni incalescere gregis primum coeuntium,' seu `in omni incalescentia primum coeuntium ex grege' significet vera et bona quae spontanea seu ex libero sunt, seu 
quod idem, quae ex summa affectione; quod omne id quod est amoris seu affectionis, sit liberum, videatur n. 2870: quod omnis conjunctio veri et boni fiat in libero, et quod nulla conjunctio in coacto, 
n. 2875, 3145, 3146, 3158; inde quod omnis reformatio et regeneratio fiat per liberum, n. 1937, 1947, 2876-2881, si per coactum fieri posset, quod omnes salvarentur, n. 2881. </p>
