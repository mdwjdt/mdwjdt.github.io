<h3 align="center" class="ired">属天的奥秘 第1927节</h3>
<h4 align="center"></h4><p>1927．“旷野的水泉旁”表尚未获得任何生命的属世真理。这从“水泉”和“旷野”的含义清楚可知：“水泉”表真理，“旷野”表至今拥有极少生命之物。在以下论及主的经文中，“旷野”在内义上表示类似事物。路加福音：<br />那孩子渐渐长大，心灵强健，住在旷野，直到他显明在以色列人面前的日子。（路加福音<a href="http://39-27.cn/路1.80.htm">1:80</a>）<br />从圣言中的很多经文可以证实，“水泉”和“旷野”表示这些事物。但由于下文频繁提到“水泉”和“旷野”，它们在那里的含义和此处一样，故蒙主怜悯，我将在那些地方进一步予以证明。至于何为尚未获得生命的真理，这从接下来的论述明显可知。</p>

By a fountain of waters in the wilderness. That this signifies natural truth that had not as yet attained to life, is evident from the signification of "a fountain of waters," as being truth; and from 
the signification of "the wilderness," as being that which as yet has but little vitality. Such also is the signification of this term in the internal sense in Luke, where the Lord is treated of: </p>
<p> 
    The child [John] grew, and waxed strong in spirit and was in the wilderness until the day of his showing unto Israel (Luke 1:80). That "a fountain of waters" and "the wilderness" signify these things, 
may be confirmed by very many passages from the Word; but as mention is very often made of "fountains" in what follows, and also of the "wilderness," where their signification is the same as here, 
of the Lord's Divine mercy the proof will there be given. What it is for truth not yet to have attained to life, will be evident from what is to be said presently. </p>

<p align="center"><b>Elliott(1983-1999) 1927</b></p><p><b>1927.</b>
'Near a spring of water in the desert' means natural truth that has not yet acquired any life. This is clear from the meaning of 'a spring of water' as truth, and from the meaning of 'desert' as that 
which as yet possesses little life. Something similar is meant by 'desert' in the internal sense of the following reference to the Lord in Luke, </p>
<blockquote>
The boy grew and became strong in spirit; he was however 
in desert places till the days of his manifestation to Israel. <a href="http://bible.gospelcom.net/cgi-bin/bible?passage=Luke%201:80&amp;version=ESV&amp;interface=print&amp;showfn=yes&amp;showxref">Luke 1:80</a>.
</blockquote>
<A name="fntext1"></a><A href="#fn1"><sup>a</sup></a> </p>
<p>It may be confirmed from very many places in the Word that 'spring of water' and 'desert' have these meanings, but as 
'springs' and also 'a desert' are frequently mentioned in places further on where they have the same meanings, confirmations will in the Lord's Divine mercy be given in those places. What truth is when 
it has yet to acquire life will be clear from what is to be stated next.

</p><b>1927.</b>
`Ad fontem aquarum in deserto': quod significet verum naturale adhuc non vitam adeptum, constat (c)a significatione `fontis aquarum' quod sit verum, et ex significatione `deserti' quod sit id quod parum 
vitale adhuc; similiter ac per illud in sensu interno apud Lucam ubi de {1}Domino, Puer crevit et corroboratus est spiritu, erat tamen in desertis usque ad dies apparitionis illius ad Israelem, 
i (x)80. Quod `fons aquarum et desertum' haec significent, confirmari potest plurimis ex Verbo, sed quia in sequentibus saepius fit mentio fontium, ut et deserti, etiam in tali significatione, ibi, ex 
Divina Domini Misericordia, confirmabitur: (m)quid sit quod verum nondum vitam adeptum sit, constabit a mox dicendis.(n) @1 In the literal sense these words refer to John the Baptist, but in the spiritual 
sense he represents the Lord, n. 5620.$ </p>
