<h4 align="center"></h4><p><strong>5075.</strong>“这些话以后”表此前的事物之后。这从“话”的含义清楚可知，在原文，“话”也表示事物。因此，“这些话以后”表示这些事物以后，因而表示此前的事物以后。在原文，“话”之所表示也表示事物，是因为就内义而言，“话”表示教义真理，因此总体上的一切神性真理都被称为圣言；就至高意义而言，主自己，即一切神性真理的源头，就是圣言（<a href="1288.htm">1288</a>节）。进一步的原因是，凡存在于宇宙之物，若非由通过神性真理起作用的神性良善所创造，就没有任何存在，即没有任何实际物。这解释了为何在希伯来语，“话”也表示事物。宇宙中的事物若非由通过神性真理，也就是通过圣言起作用的神性良善所创造，就没有任何存在，即没有任何实际物；这一真理明显可见于约翰福音：<br />太初有道，道与神同在，道就是神。万物是藉着祂造的；凡被造的，没有一样不是藉着祂造的。（约翰福音<a href="http://39-27.cn/约1.1.htm">1:1</a>，<a href="http://39-27.cn/约1.3.htm">3</a>）<br />这些话所拥有的内层含义大多来源于内层人，内层人就住在灵人和天使中间。因为就其灵或他肉体死亡后活着的真正自我而言，每个人都与天使并灵人相伴，尽管外在人并未意识到这一点。他因与他们相伴，故也在那些使用通用语言，因而使用源语言的人当中。正因如此，有许多属灵的含义被赋予这些话；就外在形式而言，这些含义似乎与它们格格不入；但就内在形式而言，它们完全一致，如此处“话”表示事物。其它许多表达方式也一样，如理解力被称为内在“视觉”，可以说它拥有光明；或对某事的领悟和顺从被称为听见和听从；或对某事的觉知被称为嗅觉，等等。</p>

After these words. That this signifies after the things which precede, is evident from the signification of "words," in the original language, as being things; here therefore "after these words" means 
after these things, thus after the things which precede. That "words," in the original language signify things also, is because "words," in the internal sense signify truths of doctrine; and therefore 
all Divine truth in general is called the "Word," and the Lord Himself, from whom comes all Divine truth, is in the supreme sense the "Word" (n. 1288). And because nothing that exists in the universe 
is anything, that is, is a real thing, unless it is from Divine good by Divine truth, therefore "words" in the Hebrew language mean things also. That nothing in the universe is anything, that is, a 
real thing, unless it is from Divine good by Divine truth, that is, by the "Word," is plain in John: </p>
<p>	In the beginning was the Word, and the Word was with God, and God was the Word. All things were 
made by Him; and without Him was not anything made that was made (John 1:1, 3). [2] The interior significations of expressions for the most part originate in the interior man, which is among spirits 
and angels; for every man as to his spirit, or as to that very man which lives after the decease of the body, is in company with angels and spirits, although the external man is not aware of this; and 
because he is in company with them, he is also with them in the universal language, and thus in the origins of words. Hence there are imparted to words many significations which in the external form 
appear out of agreement, although in the internal form they are entirely in agreement-as here, that "words" signify things. It is the same in a host of cases, as that the understanding is called the inward 
"sight," light being attributed to it; that attention and obedience are called "hearing" and "hearkening;" that the perception of a thing is called "smelling;" and so forth. </p>

'After these words' means after the things prior to this. This is clear from the meaning of 'words' in the original language, in which the same expression also means things. This therefore is why 'after 
these words' here means after these things, and so after those that happened prior to this. The reason words

<h4>Notes</h4><small>
<a name="fn1"></a><a href="#fntext1"><sup>a</sup></a> in the original language also means things is that in the internal sense 'words' means 
the truths of doctrine, on account of which all Divine Truth in general is called the Word; and in the highest sense the Lord Himself, the source of all Divine Truth, is the Word, <a href="1288.htm">1288</a>. A further reason 
is that no thing which comes into being anywhere in the world has any existence, that is, any reality, unless it has been created by Divine Coed acting through Divine Truth. It explains why in Hebrew 
the same expression is used for things as for words. The truth that no thing anywhere in the world has any existence, that is, any reality, unless it has been created by Divine Good acting through 
Divine Truth, that is, through the Word, is evident in John, </p>

 The interior meanings that words possess have their origin for the most part in the interior man, which dwells with spirits and angels. For as to his spirit, 
that is, as to his true self which lives after the death of his body, everyone lives in communion with angels and spirits, though the external man is not conscious of this. Living in communion with 
them he is also among those who use a universal language and so use that which is the origin of verbal expressions. It is for this reason that words have many spiritual meanings attached to them which 
to outward appearance seem to be out of keeping with them; but inwardly they are in keeping, as with the meaning of 'words' here as things. The same is true of very many other expressions, as when 
for instance a person's understanding is called his inner sight and is said to possess light, or as when his apprehension of and obedience to something is called hearing and listening, or as when his 
detection of something is called smelling, and so on. </p>

`Post verba illa': quod significet post illa quae praecedunt, constat ex significatione `verborum' in lingua originali, quod etiam sint res; hic itaque `post verba illa' est post res illas, ita post 
illa quae praecedunt. Quod `verba' in lingua originali etiam significent res, est quia `verba' in sensu interno significant vera doctrinae, quapropter omne Divinum Verum in genere vocatur verbum, 
ac Ipse Dominus, a Quo omne Divinum Verum in sensu supremo est Verbum, n. 1288; et quia nihil quod in universo existit, est aliquid, hoc est, est res, nisi sit ex Divino Bono per Divinum Verum; 
{1}ideo verba in lingua Hebraea etiam sunt res; quod nihil in universo sit aliquid, hoc est, res, nisi sit ex Divino Bono per Divinum Verum, hoc est, per Verbum, patet apud Johannem, In principio 
erat Verbum, et Verbum erat apud Deum, et Deus erat Verbum;...omnia per Ipsum facta sunt, et sine Ipso factum est nihil quod factum est,i 1, 3. Significativa interiora vocum trahunt quoad plurimam 
partem originem 2 ex interiore homine, qui cum spiritibus et angelis est; </p>
<p>quilibet enim homo quoad spiritum suum, seu quoad ipsum illum hominem qui vivit post obitum corporis, est cum angelis et spiritibus 
in societate, tametsi homo externus hoc nescit, et quia in societate cum illis est, etiam est cum illis in lingua universali, ita in originibus vocum; inde est quod plura significativa vocibus 
indita sint, quae apparent in externa forma non congruentia, et usque in interna congruunt, ut hic `verba' quod significent res; similiter in perpluribus aliis, sicut quod intellectus dicatur 
`visus internus', et ei tribuatur `lux', quod animadvertentia et oboedientia `auditus et auscultatio', apperceptio rei `odoratus; et sic porro. </p>
