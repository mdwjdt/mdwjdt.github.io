<h3 align="center" class="ired">属天的奥秘 第6311节</h3>
<h4 align="center"></h4><p><strong>6311.</strong>如前所述，地狱正是靠着这种劣质的光看见，一些并不那么坏的人，也就是说，那些不贪婪、通奸或骄奢淫逸的人也是靠这光看见；他们之所以靠这光看见，是因为他们没有培育其心智的理性层。一天早晨，我得以看见那些生活在一种朦胧中的灵人。我看见他们在一个集市上，成群结队，拿着装原料的麻袋，称了称，抬走了。那时，一些塞壬就在不远处；我听见她们说，她们想去那里，因为她们能亲眼看见人。事实上，比起其他人，塞壬更是通奸者，而且反对一切属天或属灵事物，所以只能看见那些靠感官的劣质之光看见的灵人，因为这些塞壬本身也是靠这种光看见。</p>

In the light just referred to are as before said the hells, and in it also are some who are not so evil, that is, who have not been avaricious, adulterous, or voluptuous, but who have come into this 
light because they have not cultivated their rational. It was given me early one morning to see these spirits in a kind of twilight; they appeared in a public place, in crowds, carrying bags in which 
were crude materials, weighing them, and carrying them away. Some sirens were at that time not far off, and I heard them saying that they desired to be there, because they saw men with their eyes. For 
as sirens have been more adulterous than others, and also in opposition to all heavenly and spiritual things, they cannot see other spirits, except such as are in sensuous light, because they themselves 
are of the same character. </p>

As has been stated, it is by that inferior light that hell sees, and it is by that light too that some people who are not so wicked see, that is to say, people who have not been avaricious, adulterers, 
or mere pleasure-seekers, but who have come to see by that light because they have not cultivated the rational degree of their mind. I have been allowed to see those spirits living in a kind of twilight. 
I saw them in a market-place, crowds of them, where they were bringing sacks containing raw materials; they were weighing them and carrying them away. Some sirens were not far away at that time, 
and I heard them saying that they wanted to be there because they could see people with their own eyes. For since sirens more than any others have been given to adultery and have also been opposed to 
everything celestial or spiritual, they are unable to see any other spirits except those who see by the inferior light of the senses. For the sirens themselves see by that kind of light. </p>

</p><b>6311.</b>
In lumine illo sunt, ut dictum, inferna, {1}et in illo etiam sunt aliqui qui non ita mali sunt, qui nempe non avari, adulteri aut voluptuosi fuerunt, sed qui tales facti sunt quia rationale suum non 
excoluerunt; datum est quodam diluculo videre hos spiritus; apparebant in foro, turmatim, portantes saccos in quibus materiae rudes, ponderantes illa et deportantes.  Sirenes quaedam tunc non procul 
erant, et audiebam illas dicentes quod vellent ibi esse, quia vident oculis suis homines; sirenes enim, quia fuerunt adulterae prae aliis, et quoque contra omnia caelestia et spiritualia non videre possunt 
alios spiritus quam qui in lumine sensuali sunt, quia ipsae tales sunt. @1 at$ </p>
