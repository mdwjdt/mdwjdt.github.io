<h3 align="center" class="ired">属天的奥秘 第4906节</h3>
<h4 align="center"></h4><p><strong>4906.</strong>“拉出她来，把她烧了”表它应被灭绝，即他玛所代表的教会内在应被灭绝。这从“拉出她来，把她烧了”的含义清楚可知，“拉出她来，把她烧了”是指被灭绝。“拉出来”论及真理，“烧了”论及要被灭绝的良善。“烧”论及良善的灭绝，这一点从圣言中的许多经文明显看出来；原因在于，“火”和“火焰”在灵义上表示良善，因而“热”表示对良善的情感；但就反面意义而言，“火”和“火焰”表示邪恶，因而“热”表示对邪恶的情感（<a href="1297.htm">1297</a>，<a href="1861.htm">1861</a>，<a href="2446.htm">2446</a>节）。此外，良善实实在在是属灵之火，赋予生命的属灵之热由此放射出来；邪恶也是火，焚毁人的热由此放射出来。凡将注意力转向这个问题，并反思它的人都能清楚看出，爱之良善是属灵之火，对该良善的情感是属灵之热。事实上，人若深入思考人的生命之火和热出自何处，就会发现爱是它的源头；因为一旦爱停止，人就变冷；而爱越在他里面增长，他就变得越温暖。除非人的生命之火和热出自这个源头，否则他根本不可能拥有生命。但产生生命的这属灵之火或热却在恶人当中变得一团焚毁的烈火，因为对他们来说，它就转化为这种火。在没有理性的活物或动物当中，属灵之热同样流入进来，并带来生命，但这生命照在其器官形式中的接受而各异，因此，它们的知识和情感是与生俱来的，如蜜蜂和其它生物。</p>

Bring her forth, and let her be burnt. That this signifies that it ought to be extirpated, namely, the internal of the church which is represented by Tamar, is evident from the signification of "bringing 
her forth and burning her," as being to extirpate. "Bringing forth" is predicated of the truth, and "burning" of the good, which was to be extirpated. That "burning" is predicated of the extirpation 
of good is evident from many passages in the Word; and the reason is that "fire" and "flame" in the spiritual sense denote good, and hence "heat" denotes the affection of good; but in the opposite 
sense "fire" and "flame" denote evil, and the "heat" thence the affection of evil (n. 1297, 1861, 2446). Moreover, good is actually spiritual fire, from which comes the spiritual heat which vivifies, 
and evil is the fire and the consequent heat which consumes. That the good of love is spiritual fire, and that the affection of this good is spiritual heat, will be very evident to one who attends and 
reflects; for if he reflects whence man has vital fire and heat, he will find that it is from love; because as soon as love ceases, the man grows cold, while the more he is in love, the warmer he grows. 
Unless man's vitality were from this origin he could have no life at all. But this spiritual fire or heat which produces life becomes a burning and consuming fire with the evil, for with them it 
is turned into this kind of fire. With animals devoid of reason spiritual heat likewise flows in and produces life, but a life according to the reception in their organic forms, for which reason their 
knowledges and affections are connate, as with bees and the rest. </p>

'Bring her out, and let her be burnt' means that it - that is to say, the internal aspect of the Church which Tamar represented - should be exterminated. This is clear from the meaning of 'bringing her 
out, and burning her' as exterminating, 'bringing out' having reference to the truth and 'burning' to the good which were to be exterminated. The use of 'burning' in reference to the extermination 
of good is clear from many places in the Word. The reason for the usage is that in the spiritual sense 'fire' and 'flame' mean good, <a href="934.htm">934</a>, and the heat radiated from them the affection for good, while 
'fire' and 'flame' in the contrary sense mean evil, and the heat radiated from these the affection for evil, <a href="1297.htm">1297</a>, <a href="1861.htm">1861</a>, <a href="2446.htm">2446</a>. Also, in actual fact good is spiritual fire from which spiritual heat which 
is life-giving is radiated; and evil too is a fire, but from this a heat which is a consuming one is radiated. Anyone who turns his attention to this matter and reflects on it can plainly see that 
the good of love is spiritual fire, and that the affection for that good is spiritual heat if he reflects on the question where do man's vital fire and heat come from, he will discover that love is the 
source of it; for as soon as love departs a person begins to grow cold, but as love increases in him he becomes wanner. Unless man's vital fire and heat came from that source he could not possibly have 
life at all. But this life-bringing fire or spiritual heat becomes among the evil a destroying and consuming fire, for in their case it is converted into this kind of fire. Among living creatures 
which do not possess reason spiritual heat likewise flows in and brings life, but life which is varied, depending on the ways in which their organic forms, and therefore their knowledge and innate affections 
receive that life, as with bees and all other creatures. </p>

'Educite illam et comburatur': quod significet quod exstirpandum, nempe internum Ecclesiae quod per `Tamarem' repraesentatur, constat ex significatione `educere illam et comburere' quod sit exstirpare, 
`educere' praedicatur de vero, et `comburere' de bono, quae exstirpanda: quod `comburere' praedicetur de exstirpatione boni, constat pluribus locis in Verbo; {1}hoc inde est quia `ignis ac flamma' 
in spirituali sensu est bonum {2}, et inde calor est affectio boni; (c)ac in opposito sensu ignis et flamma est malum, et inde calor est {3}affectio mali, n. 1297, 1861, 2446; etiam (t)bonum 
actualiter est ignis spiritualis ex quo calor spiritualis qui vivificat, et malum est ignis et inde calor qui consumit; quod bonum amoris sit ignis spiritualis, et quod affectio illius boni sit calor 
spiritualis, constare potest manifeste ei qui attendit et reflectit; si enim reflectit unde ignis et calor vitalis homini, comperiet quod ex amore, ut primum enim {4}cessat amor, etiam frigescit 
homo, et quo magis in amore est, eo magis calescit; nisi ex illa origine foret vitale hominis, nequaquam potuisset vitam habere; sed ignis ille seu calor spiritualis qui facit vitam, fit ignis {5} 
comburens et consumens apud malos, vertitur enim apud illos in talem; apud animalia rationis expertia, etiam calor spiritualis influit et facit vitam, sed vitam secundum receptionem in formis eorum 
organicis, inde illis scientiae et affectiones connatae, {6}ut apibus et reliquis. @1 causa$ @2 i n. 934$ @3 A d affectio i cupiditas. All refs. given have cupiditas$ @4 cesset$ @5 i et calor$ @6 sicut$ </p>
