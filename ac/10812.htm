<h3 align="center" class="ired">属天的奥秘 第10812节</h3>
<h4 align="center"></h4><p><strong>10812</strong>.此后，我看见一些修道士灵人，他们在世时曾是旅行或传教的修道士，如前所述。我还看见由该星球的灵人组成的一群人，其中大多数是恶人；这些修道士灵人把他们拉到自己那一边，迷惑他们。我看见这些灵人在该星球的东部地区，他们将前面所提到的出现在北边的善灵赶走了。这群灵人，连同迷惑他们的人，有数千人，被聚集成一体分离出去，他们当中的恶人被扔进地狱。我还被允许与一个修道士灵人交谈，问他在那里做什么。他说，他来教导他们关于主的事。“还有别的吗？”我问道。“天堂和地狱”，他说。“还有什么？”我再问。“要相信我即将告诉他们的一切话”，他回答说。“还有什么？”我又问。“赦罪，以及打开和关闭天堂的权柄”，他回答。这时，他接受检查，看看他对于主、信之真理、赦罪、人类的救赎，天堂和地狱都知道什么。结果发现，他几乎什么也不知道，在每一件事上都住在黑暗和虚假中，全神贯注于获得利益和统治权的欲望，他在世上获得这种欲望，并将其从世上带来。因此，他被告知，正是这种欲望促使他一路旅行到那里，并且由于他所教导的事都是这样的，所以他在这个星球的灵人当中的出现只会夺走天堂之光，引入地狱的黑暗，由此使得地狱，而不是主在他们当中掌权。此外，尽管他在天堂的事上愚蠢至极，却能狡猾地把人们引入歧途。他因具有这种性质，故随后被扔进地狱。这个星球的灵人以这种方式摆脱了这些修道士灵人。</p>

Afterward there were seen monkish spirits, who in the world had been traveling monks or missionaries, as above related. And there was also seen a crowd consisting of spirits of that earth, most of them 
evil, whom they had drawn over to their party and had seduced. These were seen at the eastern quarter of that earth, from which they drove away the good, who as before related appeared at the north 
side of the earth. That crowd, together with those who had seduced them, were gathered into one to the number of several thousands, and were separated, and the evil from among them were cast into the 
hells. It was also granted me to converse with one spirit, a monk, and to ask him what he was doing there. He said that he was teaching them about the Lord "What else?" "About heaven and hell." "What 
else?" "About belief in all things which I shall say." "What else?" "About the power of remitting sins and of opening and closing heaven." He was then examined as to what he knew about the Lord, about 
the truths of faith, about the remission of sins, about the salvation of man, and about heaven and hell; and it was found that he knew scarcely anything, and that he was in obscurity and falsity about 
each and all things, and that there was nothing seated in him but the cupidity of acquiring wealth and dominion. He had contracted this cupidity in the world, and consequently he had it in him, and 
he was therefore told that as he had traveled so far under the influence of this cupidity, and as such was his condition in respect to doctrine, his presence among the spirits of that earth could have 
no other result than the taking away of heavenly light, and the introduction of the darkness of hell, the effect of which would be that hell would rule in them, and not the Lord. Moreover, in spite 
of his stupidity in respect to the things that belong to heaven, he was cunning in leading people astray; and being of such a character he was then cast into hell. In this manner were the spirits of that 
earth freed from those monkish missionaries. </p>

After this I saw monastic spirits, that is to say, those who had been travelling or missionary monks in the world, spoken of above. I also saw a crowd that consisted of spirits belonging to that planet, 
mostly evil ones, whom the monastic spirits had won over to their side and led astray. I saw these in the eastern quarter of that planet, from which they had driven away those good spirits referred 
to already who appeared on the northern side. That crowd along with those leading them astray, numbering several thousands, were gathered into a single unit and set apart; then the evil among them were 
thrown into hell. I was also allowed to talk to one monastic spirit and to ask him what he was doing there. He said that he had come to teach them about the Lord. 'What else?' I asked. 'About heaven 
and hell', he said. 'What else?' I asked again. 'About faith in all the things I am going to tell them', he replied. 'What else?' I asked yet again. 'About the power to forgive sins, and to open and 
close heaven', he responded. At this point he was examined to see what he knew about the Lord, the truths of faith, the forgiveness of sins, human salvation, and heaven and hell. He was found to know 
scarcely anything at all, to dwell in darkness and falsity regarding every single thing, and to be wholly occupied with the desire for gain and dominion, a desire which he had acquired in the world 
and brought with him from there. He was therefore told that since it was this desire that had inspired him to travel all the way there, and since the things he taught were such as they were, he inevitably 
removed the light of heaven when among spirits of that planet and introduced the darkness of hell, thereby causing hell, not the Lord, to reign among them. Furthermore, for all his stupidity so far 
as things of heaven were concerned he possessed an artful way of leading people astray. Since he was by nature such he was subsequently thrown into hell. This was how the spirits belonging to that 
planet were delivered from spirits like him.  </p>

Postea visi sunt spiritus monachales, qui nempe fuerant monachi peregrinatores seu missionarii in mundo, de quibus supra dictum est; et quoque visa {1}est turba, quae erat ex spiritibus illius telluris, 
plerisque malis, quos in sui partes traxerunt et seduxerant; hi visi sunt ad plagam orientalem illius telluris, e qua abegerunt bonos qui ad septentrionale latus {2} telluris, de quibus prius, {3}apparuerunt; 
illa turba una cum suis {4}seductoribus in unum collecti sunt, ad aliquot milia, et separati {5}; ac mali {6}ex illis conjecti sunt in inferna.  Cum uno spiritu monacho dabatur etiam loqui 
et {7}quaerere quid faceret ibi, dicebat ut illos doceret de Domino; quid porro, de caelo et inferno; quid porro, de fide omnium quae dicturus; quid porro, de potestate remittendi peccata, ac aperiendi 
et claudendi caelum; explorabatur tunc quid sciret de Domino, de veris fidei, de remissione peccatorum, de salvatione hominis, ac de caelo et inferno, et compertum est quod vix aliquid sciret, et 
quod esset in obscuro et in falso de omnibus et singulis, et quod solum insideret ei lucrandi et dominandi cupiditas quam in mundo contraxit et inde secum habuit; quare dicebatur ei quod quia ex illa 
cupiditate usque illuc peregrinatus est, et {8}quia talis erat quoad doctrinam, non aliter potuisset quam apud spiritus illius telluris auferre lucem caelestem, et inferre tenebras inferni, et sic efficere, 
quod infernum apud illos dominaretur, et non Dominus.  Praeterea astutus erat in seducendo, tametsi stupidus quoad illa quae caeli erant; is quia talis erat, dein conjectus est in infernum; {9} 
sic spiritus illius telluris ab illis liberati sunt. @1 turba circum illos, turba haec$ @2 i illius$ @3 apparebant$ @4 praefectis$ @5 i quoque$ @6 eorum$ @7 quaerebatur$ @8 talis esset$ @9 i et$ </p>
