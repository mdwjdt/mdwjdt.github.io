<h3 align="center" class="ired">属天的奥秘 第4503节</h3>
<h4 align="center"></h4><p><strong>4503.</strong>“雅各的儿子们就来到被杀的人那里，掳掠那城”表他的所有后代都毁灭了这教义。这从“雅各的儿子们”、“掳掠”和“城”的含义清楚可知：“雅各的儿子们”是指出身于雅各的后代，如前所述；“掳掠”是指毁灭；“城”是指教会的教义，如前所述（<a href="4500.htm">4500</a>节）。西缅和利未杀了城中所有男丁，以及哈抹和示剑后，雅各的儿子们又“来到被杀的人那里，掳掠那城”；这是一个奥秘，若不藉着内义，它的含义不会显明。<br />该奥秘乃是这样：由 “西缅和利未”所代表的教会真理和良善被灭绝，虚假和邪恶取而代之后，那些由雅各其余的儿子在反面意义上所表示的虚假和邪恶就被添加了上去。雅各的每一个儿子都代表了信与仁的某个总体方面，如前所示（<a href="2129.htm">2129</a>，<a href="3858.htm">3858</a>，<a href="3913.htm">3913</a>，<a href="3926.htm">3926</a>，<a href="3939.htm">3939</a>，<a href="4060.htm">4060</a>）；至于每个儿子代表哪一方面，可参看以下章节：流便，3861，3866，3870节；犹大，3881节；但，3921-3923节；拿弗他利，3927，3928节；迦得，3934，3935节；亚设，3938，3939节；以萨迦，3956，3957节；西布伦，3960，3961节。一旦教会的真理和良善被灭绝，他们所代表的信和仁的这些总体方面就会变成那种虚假和邪恶，然后这些进一步的虚假和邪恶就被添加给他们；因为一旦教会被败坏和灭绝，虚假和邪恶就会在教会中不断增长。西缅和利未杀了城中所有男丁，以及哈抹和示剑，把底拿带出来走了以后，雅各的儿子们又来到被杀的人那里，掳掠那城，就表示这些添加的虚假和邪恶。<br />在圣言中，“被杀的人”表示被灭绝的真理与良善，这一点从以下经文明显看出来。以赛亚书：<br />惟独你被抛弃在你的坟墓之外，好像可憎的枝子，被杀之人的衣服，就是被剑刺透，坠落坑中石头那里的；又像脚下被践踏的尸首一样。（以赛亚书<a href="http://39-27.cn/赛14.19.htm">14:19</a>）<br />这论及巴比伦。“被剑刺透的”表示那些亵渎教会真理的人。<br />被杀的必然抛弃，尸首臭气上腾。（以赛亚书<a href="http://39-27.cn/赛34.3.htm">34:3</a>）<br />这论及充斥教会的虚假与邪恶，“被杀的”就表示这些。<br />以西结书：<br />列族的强暴人必拔刀砍坏你用智慧得来的美物，亵渎你的光彩。他们必使你下到坑中，你必死在海中被杀之人的深渊。（以西结书<a href="http://39-27.cn/结28.7.htm">28:7</a>-<a href="http://39-27.cn/结28.8.htm">8</a>）<br />这论及推罗君王，他表示对真理与良善的首要认知；“死在海中被杀之人的深渊”表示那些通过记忆知识孵化虚假，并由此玷污教会真理的人。<br /><br />这些也与它们同下阴间，到被剑所杀的人那里。你要与伊甸的诸树一同下到阴府，在未受割礼的人中间与被剑所杀的人一同躺卧。（以西结书<a href="http://39-27.cn/结31.17.htm">31:17</a>-<a href="http://39-27.cn/结31.18.htm">18</a>）<br /><br />你下去与未受割礼的人一同躺卧吧！他们必在被剑所杀的人中间仆倒；大有威势的领袖要在阴间当中对他说话。（以西结书<a href="http://39-27.cn/结32.19.htm">32:19</a>-<a href="http://39-27.cn/结32.21.htm">21</a>）<br />这论及法老和埃及。“被剑所杀的人”表示那些因利用知识而发疯的人；他们通过利用知识摧毁了在教会所知真理上的一切信仰。<br />诗篇：<br />我算和下坑的人同列，如同无力的人一样，被丢在死人中间，好像被杀的人躺在坟墓里。他们是你不再记念的，与你的手隔绝了。（诗篇<a href="http://39-27.cn/诗88.4.htm">88:4</a>-<a href="http://39-27.cn/诗88.5.htm">5</a>）<br />在阴间（即地狱）“被杀的人”，就是“下坑”并“躺在坟墓里的人”，表示那些用虚假和邪恶摧毁自己里面的真理和良善的人。显然，他们在地狱，不仅仅是因为他们被剑所杀。<br />以赛亚书：<br />你这大有喧哗的城，欢乐的邑啊，（你中间被杀的）并不是被剑刺死的，也不是在战场上被杀的；你中间一切被找到的都一同被捆绑，他们本是逃往远方的。（以赛亚书<a href="http://39-27.cn/赛22.2.htm">22:2</a>-<a href="http://39-27.cn/赛22.3.htm">3</a>）<br />这论及由感官事物所产生的幻觉，教会的真理无法通过这些感官事物被看到。因此，这论及陷入消极怀疑的人，这些人被称为“被杀的并不是被剑刺死的”。<br />以西结书：<br /><br />我必使刀剑临到你们，也必毁灭你们的高地。你们的祭坛必被拆毁，你们的雕像必被打碎，我要使你们被杀的人倒在你们的偶像面前；被杀的人必倒在你们中间，你们就知道我是耶和华。被杀的人，倒在他们祭坛四围的偶像中间，那时，你们就承认我是耶和华。（以西结书<a href="http://39-27.cn/结6.3.htm">6:3</a>-<a href="http://39-27.cn/结6.4.htm">4</a>，<a href="http://39-27.cn/结6.7.htm">7</a>，<a href="http://39-27.cn/结6.13.htm">13</a>）<br />此处“被杀的人”表示那些陷入教义虚假的人。<br /><br />要污秽这殿，使院中充满被杀的人。他们就出去，在城中击杀。（以西结书<a href="http://39-27.cn/结9.7.htm">9:7</a>）<br />这是一个预言的异象。“要污秽这殿，使院中充满被杀的人”表示亵渎良善与真理。<br />你们在这城中增多了你们所杀的人，使被杀的人充满街道。所以主耶和华如此说：你们所杀的人，就是你们放在城中间的，他们就是肉，这城就是锅，祂要把你们从城中间带出去。（以西结书<a href="http://39-27.cn/结11.6.htm">11:6</a>-<a href="http://39-27.cn/结11.7.htm">7</a>）<br />由于“被杀的人”表示那些用虚假和邪恶灭绝自己里面的教会真理之人，因此在代表教会，摸了被杀之人的，是不洁净的。关于这种人，我们在摩西五经中读到：<br />无论何人在田野地面摸了被剑杀的，或是自死的，或是人的骨头，或是坟墓，就要七天不洁净。（民数记<a href="http://39-27.cn/民19.16.htm">19:16</a>，<a href="http://39-27.cn/民19.18.htm">18</a>）<br />所以进行调查，拿小母牛烧成除罪灰。<br />若遇见被杀的人倒卧在田野，不知道是谁杀了他，城中长老和审判官就要出去，从被杀的人那里量起，直量到四围的城邑。看哪城离被杀的人最近，那城的长老就要从牛群中取一只未曾耕地、未曾负轭的母牛犊，把母牛犊牵到河流或山谷，在那里打折母牛犊的颈项。他们要在所打折颈项的母牛犊以上洗手，说，我们的手未曾流这人的血，我们的眼也未曾看见这事。耶和华啊，求你赦免你的以色列民，不要使流无辜血的罪归在你的百姓中间。他们流血的罪必得赦免。（申命记<a href="http://39-27.cn/申21.1.htm">21:1</a>-<a href="http://39-27.cn/申21.8.htm">8</a>）<br />之所以制定这些律法，是因为“被杀的”表示用虚假和邪恶歪曲、摧毁并亵渎教会的真理；这一点从内义中的每个细节明显看出来。经上之所以说“被杀的人倒卧在田野”，是因为“田野”表示教会（参看<a href="2971.htm">2971</a>，<a href="3310.htm">3310</a>，<a href="3766.htm">3766</a>节）。“一只未曾耕地的母牛犊”表示处于无知的外在人的纯真。若不藉着内义知道这些事，谁都会为制定这种除罪程序而感到惊讶。</p>

<p align="center"><b>Potts(1905-1910) 4503</b></p><p><b>4503.</b>
The sons of Jacob came upon those who were pierced, and plundered the city. That this signifies that all that posterity destroyed the doctrine, is evident from the signification of the "sons of Jacob," 
as being the posterity from Jacob (of which above); from the signification of "to plunder" as being to destroy; and from the signification of a "city," as being the doctrine of the church (see above, 
n. 4500). That after Simeon and Levi had slain every male in the city, and also Hamor and Shechem, they went forth, and that the sons of Jacob then came upon those who were pierced and plundered the 
city, is a mystery not manifest except from the internal sense. [2] This mystery is that after the truth and good of the church represented by Simeon and Levi had been extinguished, and falsity and 
evil had taken their place, there were then superadded those falsities and evils which are signified in the opposite sense by the rest of the sons of Jacob. (That each son of Jacob represented some general 
principle of faith and charity was shown above, n. 2129, 3858, 3913, 3926, 3939, 4060; what was represented by Reuben, n. 3861, 3866, 3870; what by Judah, n. 3881; what by Dan, n. 3921-3923; what 
by Naphtali, n. 3927, 3928; what by Gad, n. 3934, 3935; what by Asher, n. 3938, 3939; what by Issachar, n. 3956, 3957; and what by Zebulun, n. 3960, 3961.) These generals of faith and charity represented 
by them become falsities and evils of that kind when once the truth and good of the church have been extinguished, and then these falsities and evils are superadded; for falsities and evils continually 
grow in the church that has once been perverted and extinguished, and it is these which are signified by the sons of Jacob coming upon those who were pierced and plundering the city, after Simeon 
and Levi had slain every male in the city, and Hamor and Shechem also, and had taken away Dinah, and had gone forth. [3] That by "those who are pierced" are signified in the Word truths and goods 
extinguished is evident from the following passages. In Isaiah: </p>
<p>     Thou art cast forth out of thy sepulchre like an abominable shoot, the raiment of the slain that are pierced with the sword, that 
go down to the stones of the pit, as a carcass trodden under foot (Isa. 14:19); </p>
<p>said of Babylon; "those pierced with the sword" denote those who have profaned the truths of the church. Again: </p>
<p>    
 So that their pierced shall be cast forth, and the stink of their carcasses shall come up (Isa. 34:3); </p>
<p>treating of the falsities and evils that infest the church, which are meant by the "pierced." [4] 
In Ezekiel: </p>
<p>     The violent of the nations shall draw their sword against the beauty of thy wisdom, and they shall profane thy comeliness; they shall let thee down into the pit, and thou shall die 
the deaths of those who are pierced in the midst of the seas (Ezek. 28:7-8); </p>
<p>said of the prince of Tyre, by whom are signified the primary things of the knowledges of truth and good; "dying the deaths 
of those who are pierced in the midst of the seas," denotes those who hatch falsities by means of memory-knowledges, and thereby defile the truths of the church. [5] Again: </p>
<p>     These also shall 
go down with them into hell, unto those who are pierced with the sword; when thou shalt be made to go down with the trees of Eden into the earth of lower things, thou shalt lie in the midst of the uncircumcised, 
with them that are pierced with the sword (Ezek. 31:17-18).     Again: </p>
<p>     Go down and lie with the uncircumcised; they shall fall in the midst of those who are pierced with the sword; 
the chief of the mighty ones shall speak to him in the midst of hell (Ezek. 32:19-21); </p>
<p>said of Pharaoh and Egypt; "those pierced with the sword" denote those who become insane through knowledges, by 
which they extinguish in themselves the faith of the truth of the church. [6] In David: </p>
<p>     I am accounted among those who go down into the pit; I have become as a man that has no strength, neglected 
among the dead, like the pierced that lie in the grave, whom Thou hast remembered no more, and who have been cut off by Thy hand (Ps. 88:4-5); </p>
<p>"those who are pierced in hell," "in the pit," and 
"in the grave," denote those who have destroyed truths and goods in themselves by falsities and evils. It is obvious that they are not in hell merely because they had been pierced with the sword. [7] 
In Isaiah: </p>
<p>     A city of tumults, a city that exulteth, they are not pierced with the sword, and are not slain in war; all who have been found in thee were bound together, they fled from afar (Isa. 
22:2-3); </p>
<p>said of fallacies from sensuous things through which the truths of the church cannot be seen, and concerning which they are therefore in negative doubt, and are said to be "pierced, but not 
with the sword." [8] In Ezekiel: </p>
<p>     I bring a sword upon thee, and I destroy your high places, and your altars shall be destroyed, and your statues shall be broken, and I will cause your pierced 
ones to lie before your idols; when the pierced ones shall fall in the midst of you, you shall know that I am Jehovah; then ye shall acknowledge, when the pierced ones shall be in the midst of their idols, 
round about their altar (Ezek. 6:3-4, 7, 13); </p>
<p>where the "pierced ones" denote those who are in falsities of doctrine. [9] Again: </p>
<p>     Defile the house, and fill the courts with the pierced ones; 
they went forth and smote in the city (Ezek. 9:7); </p>
<p>a prophetic vision; "to defile the house and fill the courts with the pierced ones," denotes to profane goods and truths. Again: </p>
<p>     Ye have multiplied 
your pierced ones in this city, and ye have filled the streets thereof with the pierced one; wherefore said the Lord Jehovih, Your pierced ones whom ye have put in the midst of it, they are 
the flesh, and that is the pot, and He shall bring you forth out of the midst of it (Ezek. 11:6-7). [10] As by "the pierced" are signified those who have extinguished the truths of the church in themselves 
by falsities and evils, therefore also in the representative church they who touched one who was pierced were unclean, of whom we read in Moses: </p>
<p>     Whosoever has touched upon the surface of 
the field one that is pierced with a sword, or the dead, or a bone of a man, or a grave, shall be unclean seven days (Num. 19:16, 18). And therefore inquiry was made, and expiation was made by means 
of a calf, as again in Moses: </p>
<p>     If one pierced be found lying in the field, and it be not known who has smitten him, then the elders of the city and the judges shall come forth, and they shall measure 
toward the cities which are round about him that is pierced; and it shall be, at the city which is nearest unto him that is pierced the elders of that city shall take a she-calf of an ox, by which 
labor hath not been done, and which hath not drawn in the yoke, and they shall bring her down unto a river or a valley, and shall behead the calf there, and wash their hands over the beheaded calf, 
and shall say, Our hands have not shed blood, and our eyes have not seen it; expiate Thy people Israel, O Jehovah, and give not innocent blood in the midst of Thy people; and the blood shall be expiated 
for them (Deut. 21:1-8). [11] That these laws were given because by the "pierced" is signified the perversion, destruction, and profanation of the truth of the church by falsity and evil, is manifest 
from every particular in the internal sense. It is said "a pierced one lying in the field," because by a "field" is signified the church (see n. 2971, 3310, 3766). A "she-calf" by which labor has 
not been done signifies that innocence of the external man which is in ignorance. Unless these things were made known by the internal sense, the enjoining of such an expiatory process would excite universal 
surprise. </p>

<p align="center"><b>Elliott(1983-1999) 4503</b></p><p><b>4503.</b>
'The sons of Jacob came upon the slain, and plundered the city' means that all his descendants destroyed that doctrine. This is clear from the meaning of 'the sons of Jacob' as descendants from Jacob, 
dealt with above; from the meaning of 'plundering' as destroying; and from the meaning of 'the city' as the doctrine of the Church, dealt with above in <a href="4500.htm">4500</a>. Simeon and Levi's going away after they 
had killed every male in the city as well as Hamor and Shechem, and then Jacob's sons' coming upon the slain and plundering the city, involves an arcanum, the meaning of which is not evident except from 
the internal sense. </p>
<p></p>
<p><b>[2]</b>
 That arcanum is this: After the truth and good of the Church which are represented by 'Simeon and Levi' were wiped out and falsity and evil took their place, further falsities 
and evils were added, which are meant in the contrary sense by the rest of Jacob's sons. Each son of Jacob represented some general aspect of faith and charity, as has been shown in <a href="2129.htm">2129</a>, <a href="3858.htm">3858</a>, <a href="3913.htm">3913</a>, <a href="3926.htm">3926</a>, <a href="3939.htm">3939</a>, <a href="4060.htm">4060</a>. Which aspect is represented by each, see the following: Reuben, <a href="3861.htm">3861</a>, <a href="3866.htm">3866</a>, <a href="3870.htm">3870</a>; Judah, <a href="3881.htm">3881</a>; Dan, <a href="3921.htm">3921</a>-<a href="3923.htm">3923</a>; Naphtali, <a href="3927.htm">3927</a>, <a href="3928.htm">3928</a>; Gad, <a href="3934.htm">3934</a>, <a href="3935.htm">3935</a>; Asher, <a href="3938.htm">3938</a>, <a href="3939.htm">3939</a>; Issachar, 
<a href="3956.htm">3956</a>, <a href="3957.htm">3957</a>; Zebulun, <a href="3960.htm">3960</a>, <a href="3961.htm">3961</a>. These general aspects of faith and charity which those sons represented become falsities and evils of that kind once the truth and good of the Church have been wiped 
out and those further falsities and evils have been added to them; for falsities and evils are constantly on the increase within the Church once it has been perverted and wiped out. It is these added 
falsities and evils that are meant by the reference to Jacob's sons coming upon the slain and plundering the city after Simeon and Levi had killed every male in the city as well as Hamor and Shechem, 
and had taken Dinah and gone away.  </p>
<p></p>
<p><b>[3]</b>
 That 'the slain' in the Word means truths and goods which have been wiped out may be seen from the following places: In Isaiah, </p>
<blockquote>
You are cast out from your 
sepulchre like an abominable branch, a garment of the killed - slain with the sword - who go down to the stones of the pit like a dead body trodden underfoot. <a href="http://bible.gospelcom.net/cgi-bin/bible?passage=Isa%2014:19&amp;version=ESV&amp;interface=print&amp;showfn=yes&amp;showxref">Isa 14:19</a>. 
</blockquote>
<p>This refers to Babel. 'Those 
slain with the sword' stands for those who have profaned the truths of the Church. In the same prophet, </p>
<blockquote>
So that their slain are cast out and the stench of their dead bodies rises up. <a href="http://bible.gospelcom.net/cgi-bin/bible?passage=Isa%2034:3&amp;version=ESV&amp;interface=print&amp;showfn=yes&amp;showxref">Isa 34:3</a>. 
</blockquote>
<p>This 
refers to the falsities and evils which infest the Church, 'the slain' standing for these. </p>
<p></p>
<p><b>[4]</b>
 In Ezekiel, </p>
<blockquote>
The violent of the nations will draw the sword against the beauty of your wisdom, 
and they will profane your loveliness. They will bring you down into the pit and you will die the deaths of those slain in the midst of the seas. <a href="http://bible.gospelcom.net/cgi-bin/bible?passage=Ezek%2028:7,%208&amp;version=ESV&amp;interface=print&amp;showfn=yes&amp;showxref">Ezek 28:7, 8</a>. 
</blockquote>
<p>This refers to the prince of Tyre 
who means the leading cognitions of truth and good. 'Dying the deaths of those slain in the midst of the seas' stands for those who use facts to hatch falsities and in consequence defile the truths 
of the Church.  </p>
<p></p>
<p><b>[5]</b>
 In the same prophet, </p>
<blockquote>
They also will go down with them into hell, to those slain with the sword. You will be made to go down with the trees of Eden into the nether world, in 
the midst of the uncircumcised you will lie with those slain with the sword. <a href="http://bible.gospelcom.net/cgi-bin/bible?passage=Ezek%2031:17,%2018&amp;version=ESV&amp;interface=print&amp;showfn=yes&amp;showxref">Ezek 31:17, 18</a>. 
</blockquote>
<p>In the same prophet, </p>
<blockquote>
Go down and lie with the uncircumcised; they will fall in the midst of those slain 
with the sword; the chief of the powerful ones will speak to him in the midst of hell. <a href="http://bible.gospelcom.net/cgi-bin/bible?passage=Ezek%2032:19-21&amp;version=ESV&amp;interface=print&amp;showfn=yes&amp;showxref">Ezek 32:19-21</a>. 
</blockquote>
<p>This refers to Pharaoh and Egypt. 'Those slain with the sword' stands for those who by their 
use of knowledge become insane; by their use of it they destroy all belief in the truth known to the Church. </p>
<p></p>
<p><b>[6]</b>
 In David, </p>
<p>I have been reckoned with them going down to the pit; I have become 
as a man with no strength, neglected among the dead, like the slain lying in the sepulchre whom you remember no more and who have been cut off by your hand. </p>
<p>'The slain' in hell - those in the pit 
and 'in the sepulchre' - stands for those who have destroyed the truths and goods residing with them by means of falsities and evils. Anyone can recognize that these are not in hell merely because they 
have been slain with the sword. </p>
<p></p>
<p><b>[7]</b>
 In Isaiah, </p>
<blockquote>
A city of tumults, an exultant city, [your slain] have not been slain with the sword, and they have not been killed in war. All who have been found 
in you have been bound together in chains. They have fled from far away. <a href="http://bible.gospelcom.net/cgi-bin/bible?passage=Isa%2022:2,%203&amp;version=ESV&amp;interface=print&amp;showfn=yes&amp;showxref">Isa 22:2, 3</a>. 
</blockquote>
<p>This refers to the illusions resulting from the evidence of the senses which do not enable the truths of the 
Church to be seen. It refers therefore to people subject to negative doubt, and these are called 'slain but not with the sword'. </p>
<p></p>
<p><b>[8]</b>
 In Ezekiel, </p>
<blockquote>
I am bringing a sword upon you and destroying your 
high places; and your altars will be destroyed, and your statues will be broken; and I will cause your slain to lie before your idols. When the slain have fallen in the midst of you, you will know 
that I am Jehovah. Then you will acknowledge, when the slain are in the midst of their idols, around their altar. <a href="http://bible.gospelcom.net/cgi-bin/bible?passage=Ezek%206:3,%204,%207,%2013&amp;version=ESV&amp;interface=print&amp;showfn=yes&amp;showxref">Ezek 6:3, 4, 7, 13</a>. 
</blockquote>
<p>'The slain' stands for those who are governed by falsities of 
doctrine.  </p>
<p></p>
<p><b>[9]</b>
 In the same prophet, </p>
<blockquote>
Defile the house, and fill the courts with the slain. They went forth and smote in the city. <a href="http://bible.gospelcom.net/cgi-bin/bible?passage=Ezek%209:7&amp;version=ESV&amp;interface=print&amp;showfn=yes&amp;showxref">Ezek 9:7</a>. 
</blockquote>
<p>This is a prophetic vision. 'Defiling the house and 
filling the courts with the slain' stands for profaning goods and truths. In the same prophet, </p>
<blockquote>
You have multiplied your slain in this city, and have filled its streets with the slain. Therefore said 
the Lord Jehovih, Your slain whom you have placed in the midst of it, they are the flesh, and that is the pot; and he will lead you out from the midst of it. <a href="http://bible.gospelcom.net/cgi-bin/bible?passage=Ezek%2011:6,%207&amp;version=ESV&amp;interface=print&amp;showfn=yes&amp;showxref">Ezek 11:6, 7</a>. 
</blockquote>
<p></p>

 Because 'the slain' 
meant those who have annihilated the truths of the Church by means of falsities and evils, therefore also in the representative Church those who touched one who had been slain were unclean. Such 
persons are referred to in Moses as follows, </p>
<blockquote>
Everyone who has touched on the surface of the field one slain with the sword, or one dead, or a human bone, or a sepulchre will be unclean for seven days.

</blockquote>
<p>Inquiry was therefore made and atonement effected by means of a heifer. In the same author, </p>
<blockquote>
If one is found slain, lying in the field, and it is not known who smote him, then 
the elders of the city and the judges shall come out and they shall measure [the distance] to the cities which are around the one slain. It shall be, that in the city nearest to the one slain the elders 
of that city shall take a heifer by means of which no work has been done, which has not pulled in the yoke, and they shall bring it down to the river or valley, and there they shall break the heifer's 
neck. And they shall wash their hands over the heifer whose neck has been broken and shall say, Our hands have not shed blood, and our eyes have not seen it. Expiate Your people Israel, O Jehovah, 
and do not set innocent blood in the midst of Your people; and the blood shall be expiated for them. <a href="http://bible.gospelcom.net/cgi-bin/bible?passage=Deut%2021:1-8&amp;version=ESV&amp;interface=print&amp;showfn=yes&amp;showxref">Deut 21:1-8</a>.

<p><b>[11]</b>
 These laws were laid down because one who has been slain means the perversion, 
destruction, and profanation of the truth of the Church by means of falsity and evil, as is evident from each detail in the internal sense. The expression 'one slain, lying in the field' is used because 
'the field' means the Church, see <a href="2971.htm">2971</a>, <a href="3310.htm">3310</a>, <a href="3766.htm">3766</a>. 'A heifer by means of which no work has been done' means the innocence of the external man which is present within ignorance. Without a clear 
knowledge of these things meant in the internal sense everyone will be surprised that a procedure such as this for making expiation should ever have been ordained. </p>

`Filii Jacobi venerunt super confossos et depraedati urbem':  quod significet quod omnis illa posteritas doctrinam destruxerint, constat ex significatione `filiorum Jacobi' quod sin posteritas ex 
Jacobo, de qua supra; ex significatione `depraedari' quod sit destruere; et ex significatione `urbis' quod sit doctrina quae Ecclesiae, de qua supra n. 4500.  Quod Shimeon et Levi postquam occiderant 
omnem masculum in urbe atque Hamorem et Shechemum exiverint, et quod dein `filii Jacobi venerint super confossos e depraedati urbem,' est arcanum quod non patet nisi ex sensu interno; [2] arcanum 
hoc est quod postquam verum et bonum Ecclesiae quae per `Shimeonem et Levi' repraesentantur, exstincta sunt, et loco illorum fuit {1} falsum et malum, dein superaddita sint falsa et mala, quae in 
opposito sensu per reliquos filios Jacobi significantur; quod per unumquemque filium Jacobi aliquod commune fidei et charitatis repraesentatum sit, n. 2129, 3858, 3913, 3926, 3939, 4060 ostensum 
est; quid per Reubenem, videatur n. 3861, 3866, 3870; quid per Jehudam, n. 3881; quid per Dan, n. 3921-3923; quid per Naphtali n. 3927, 3928; quid per Gad, n. (x)3934, 3935; quid per Asher, n. 3938, 
3939; quid per Jisaschar, n. 3956, 3957; quid per Zebulun, n. 3960, 3961; communia haec fidei et charitatis quae per illos repraesentata sunt, illius generis falsa et mala fiunt quando semel Ecclesiae 
verum et bonum exstincta sunt, et tunc illa superadduntur; nam falsa et mala continue in Ecclesia semel perversa et exstincta succrescunt; haec significantur per quod `filii Jacobi venerint super 
confossos et depraedati urbem,' postquam Shimeon et Levi occiderant omnem masculum in urbe atque Hamorem et Shechemum, sustulerantque Dinam, e exiverant. [3] Quod per `confossos' in Verbo significentur 
vera et bona exstincta, constare potest ab his locis: apud Esaiam,           Tu projectus es e sepulcro tuo, sicut surculus      abominabilis vestimentum occisorum, confossi gladio,     
 descendentes ad lapides foveae, sicut cadaver conculcatum,      xiv 19; </p>
<p>ubi de Babele; `confossi gladio' pro illis qui profanarunt vera Ecclesiae apud eundem,           Ita {2} ut confossi eorum 
projiciantur, et cadaverum      eorum ascendat putor, xxxiv 3; </p>
<p>ubi de falsis et malis quae infestant Ecclesiam; `confossi' pro illis: [4] apud Ezechielem,           Violenti gentium evaginabunt gladium 
super      pulchritudinem sapientiae tuae, et profanabunt decorem tuum; </p>
<p>     in foveam demittent te, et morieris mortibus confossorum in      medio marium, (x)xxviii 7, 8; </p>
<p>ubi de principe Tyri 
per quem primaria cognitionum veri et boni significantur; `mori mortibus confossorum in medio marium' pro illis qui per scientifica excludunt falsa, et inde Ecclesiae vera conspurcant: [5] apud 
eundem,           Etiam hi cum illis descendent in infernum ad confossos      gladio;... cum descendere factus fueris cum arboribus Edenis      in terram inferiorem {3}, in medio praeputiatorum cubueris  
    cum confossis gladio, xxxi 17, 18: </p>
<p>apud eundem,           Descende et cuba cum praeputiatis, in medio confossorum      gladio cadent;... alloquentur eum praecipui potentium in      medio 
inferni, xxxii 19-21; </p>
<p>ibi de Pharaone et Aegypto; `confossi gladio' pro illis qui per scientias insaniunt, fidem veri, quod est Ecclesiae, per illas apud se exstinguendo: </p>
<p>[6] apud Davidem,    
       Reputatus sum cum descendentibus foveam, factus sum      sicut vir non robur, inter mortuos neglectus, sicut confossi      cubantes in sepulcro {4}, quorum non meministi amplius, et      qui 
a manu tua excisi sunt, Ps. lxxxviii 5, 6 [A.V. 4, 5]; </p>
<p>`confossi in inferno, in fovea et in sepulcro' pro illis qui vera et bona destruxerunt apud se per falsa et mala {5}; quod in inferno non sint 
quia confossi gladio, quisque scire potest: [7] apud Esaiam,           Urbs tumultuum, urbs exsultans,... {6} non confossi      gladio, et non occisi bello,... omnes qui (t)inventi sunt in      
te vincti una, e longinquo fugerunt, xxii 2, 3; </p>
<p>ibi de fallaciis ex sensualibus per quas vera Ecclesiae non videri possunt, (o)de quibus ideo in dubio negativo sunt; illi dicuntur `confossi sed non 
gladio': [8] apud Ezechielem,           Ego adducens super te gladium, et perdens excelsa      vestra, et destruentur altaria vestra, et frangentur statuae      vestrae, et faciam cubare confossos 
vestros coram idolis      vestris;... cum ceciderint confossi in medio vestri,      cognoscetis quod Ego Jehovah:... tunc agnoscetis,... cum      fuerint confossi in medio idolorum eorum, circum altare  
    eorum, vi [3], 4, 7, 13; </p>
<p>`confossi' pro illis qui in falsis doctrinae sunt: [9] apud eundem,           Polluite domum, et implere atria confossis:...      exiverunt et percusserunt in urbe, 
ix 7; </p>
<p>visio prophetica; `polluere domum et implere atria confossis' pro profanare bona et vera: apud eundem,           Multiplicastis confossos vestros in urbe hac, et      implevistis plateas 
ejus confosso, quapropter dixit Dominus      Jehovih, Confossi vestri, quod posuistis in medio ejus, hi      caro, et illa olla, et vos educet e medio ejus, xi 6, 7. [10] Quia per `confossos' significabantur 
illi {7} qui apud se exstinxerunt {8} vera Ecclesiae per falsa et mala, ideo quoque in Ecclesia repraesentativa illi qui tetigerunt confossum, immundi erant, de quibus (o)ita apud Mosen,  
         Omnis qui tetigerit super superficie agri confossum      gladio, aut mortuum, aut os hominis, aut sepulcrum, immundus      erit septem dies, Num. xix 16, 18; </p>
<p>et ideo inquisitio et expiatio 
per vitulam: apud eundem,           Si invenitur confossus jacens in agro,... nec scitur      qui percusserit eum, tunc exibunt seniores urbis et judices,      e metientur versus urbes quae circa 
confossum; fiet, ad      urbem proximam confosso sument seniores urbis illius vitulam      bovis per quam labor non factus, quae non traxit in jugo, et      deducent... ad fluvium seu vallem,... 
et decollabunt ibi      vitulam,... e lavabunt manus suas super vitula decollata,...      et dicent, Manus nostrae non fuderunt sanguinem, et oculi      nostri non viderunt expia populo Tuo, Israeli,...  
    (o)Jehovah, nec da sanguinem innocentem in medio populi Tui; </p>
<p>     et expiabitur illis sanguis, Deut. xxi 1-8; </p>
<p>[11] quod (t)illae leges latae sint, quia per `confossum' significatur perversio, 
destructio et profanatio veri Ecclesiae per falsum et malum, patet ex singulis in sensu interno; `confossus jacens in agro' dicitur quia per `agrum' significatur Ecclesia, videatur n. 2971, 
3310, 3766, per `vitulam per quam labor non factus' significatur innocentia externi hominis quae est in ignorantia; si ex sensu interno illa non innotescerent, quisque miraturus esset quod processus 
expiatorius talis mandatus fuisset.      @1 facta sunt$      @2 Da AI$      @3 inferiorum AI, but see n. 130$      @4 A has inferno written above sepulchro but neither deleted.$      @5 confossi
