<h3 align="center" class="ired">属天的奥秘 第3689节</h3>
<h4 align="center"></h4><p><strong>3689.</strong>创世记28:10，11.雅各走出别是巴，往哈兰去。他到了一个地方，因为太阳落了，就在那里过夜，便拾起那地方的石头，放下当枕头，就躺在那地方。 <br />“雅各走出别是巴”表距离神性教义事物更为遥远的生活。“往哈兰去”表更接近那个层级的良善与真理。“他到了一个地方”表一种状态。“因为太阳落了，就在那里过夜”表笼罩在模糊中的生活。“便拾起那地方的石头”表那状态的真理。“放下当枕头”表与神性最一般的联系。“就躺在那地方”表这种状态的宁静。</p>

Verses 10, 11. And Jacob went out from Beersheba, and went toward Haran. And he lighted upon a place, and passed the night there, for the sun was set; and he took of the stones of the place, and placed 
them for his pillows, and lay down in that place. "And Jacob went out from Beersheba" signifies life more remote from Divine doctrinal things; "and went toward Haran," signifies the good and truth 
of that degree; "and he lighted upon a place," signifies the state; "and passed the night there, for the sun was set," signifies life in what is obscure; "and he took of the stones of the place," signifies 
the truths of that state; "and placed them for his pillows," signifies communication of a most general nature with the Divine; "and lay down in that place," signifies the tranquillity of the state. </p>

Verses 10, 11 And Jacob went out from Beersheba and went to Haran. And he came upon a place, and spent the night there because the sun had gone down. And he took one of the stones of the place and placed 
it as his headrest, and lay down in that place. </p>
<p>'Jacob went out from Beersheba' means life more remote from matters of doctrine that are Divine. 'And went to Haran' means closer to that degree 
of good and truth. 'And he came upon a place' means a state. 'And spent the night there because the sun had gone down' means life enveloped in obscurity. 'And he took one of the stones of the place' 
means the truths belonging to that state. 'And placed it as his headrest' means a very general communication with the Divine. 'And lay down in that place' means the serenity of that state. </p>

Vers. 10, 11.  Et exivit Jacob e Beersheba, et ivit Haranem.  Et incidit in locum, et pernoctavit ibi, quia occidit sol, et sumpsit de lapidibus loci, et posuit subcapitalia sua, et cubuit in loco 
illo.  `Exivit Jacob e Beersheba' significat vitam remotiorem a doctrinalibus Divinis:  `et ivit Haranem' significat ad bonum et verum illius gradus:  `et incidit in locum' significat statum:  `et pernoctavit 
ibi, quia occidit sol' significat vitam in obscuro:  `et sumpsit de lapidibus loci' significat vera illius status:  `et posuit subcapitalia sua' significat communicationem communissimam cum 
Divino; `et cubuit in loco illo' significat tranquillitatem status. </p>
