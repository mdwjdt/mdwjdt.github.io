<p><strong>[NCE]1498.</strong> <a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_1498/bible_king-james-version_genesis_12_20" target=_top>Genesis 12:20</a>. And Pharaoh gave orders concerning Abram to his men, and they sent him away, and his wife, and all that he had.<br />Pharaoh gave orders concerning Abram to his men, [and they sent him away,] means that the facts the Lord knew deserted him. And his wife means that the same thing happened to the truth that was united with heavenly traits. And all that he had symbolizes everything related to heavenly truth. </p>
<p align="center"><b>Potts(1905-1910) 1498</b></p><p><b>1498.</b>
Verse 20. And Pharaoh commanded the men concerning him; and they sent him away, and his wife, and all that he had. "And Pharaoh commanded the men concerning Him, [and they sent him away]," signifies 
that memory-knowledges left the Lord; "and his wife," signifies that they also left the truths that were conjoined with celestial things; "and all that he had," signifies that they left all things that 
belonged to celestial truths. </p>

<p align="center"><b>Elliott(1983-1999) 1498</b></p><p><b>1498.</b>
Verse 20 And Pharaoh gave his men orders concerning him, and they sent him away, and his wife, and all that he had. </p>
<p>'Pharaoh gave his men orders concerning him, [and they sent him away]' means that 
facts went away from the Lord. 'And his wife' means that they also went away from the truths that were joined to celestial things. 'And all that he had' means all things that belonged to celestial truths. </p>

<p align="center"><b>Latin(1748-1756) 1498</b>
</p><b>1498.</b>
Vers. 20.  Et praecepit super illo Pharaoh viris, et dimiserunt illum, et uxorem illius, et omnia quae illi. 'Praecepit super illo Pharaoh viris' significat quod scientifica reliquerint Dominum: [Et 
dimiserunt illum] {1} 'et uxorem illius' significat quod vera caelestibus conjuncta: 'et omnia quae illi' significat omnia quae verorum caelestium essent. 	@1 The intermediate character of these words 
may have led to their omission.  They seem necessary for reliquerint in 1499 and for conjuncta in 1500.$ </p>
