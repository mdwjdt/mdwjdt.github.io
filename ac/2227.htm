<h3 align="center" class="ired">属天的奥秘 第2227节</h3>
<h4 align="center"></h4><p><strong>2227.</strong>“亚伯拉罕必要成为强大兴盛的民族”表一切良善和由此而来的一切真理必来自主。这从“亚伯拉罕”的代表和“民族”的含义清楚可知：前面多次说明，“亚伯拉罕”是指主；而“民族”是指良善，如前面所解释的（<a href="1159.htm">1159</a>，<a href="1258.htm">1258</a>-<a href="1260.htm">1260</a>，<a href="1416.htm">1416</a>，<a href="1849.htm">1849</a>节），此处“强大兴盛的民族”表示良善和源于这良善的真理。“强大”论及良善，“兴盛”论及真理。这一点可从圣言的其它地方清楚看出来，但我不便在此引用它们。从真正意义说，源于良善的真理就是属灵的良善。良善分为两种，即属天之善和属灵之善，它们彼此截然不同。属天之善是爱主的体现，属灵之善是爱邻的体现。后者，即属灵之善出于前者，即属天之善。因为没人能爱主，除非他也爱邻。对主之爱就包含对邻之爱，因为对主之爱源于主，因而源于对全人类的爱本身。在对主之爱里面就等于在主里面，凡在主里面的，必然在祂的爱里面，而祂的爱是针对全人类的，因而是针对邻舍的。因此，这两种善，即属天之善和属灵之善都在他里面。属天之善才是真正的良善本身，而事实上，属灵之善是伴随或源于属天之善的真理。正如所说的，这真理是属灵之善。前者是“强大”所表示的，而后者是“兴盛”所表示的。</p>

Abraham shall surely be for a nation great and numerous. That this signifies that all good and all the derivative truth will be from the Lord, is evident from the representation of Abraham, as being 
the Lord (often shown above), and also from the signification of a "nation," as being good (explained n. 1159, 1258-1260, 1416, 1849); here a "nation great and numerous," by which is signified good and 
the derivative truth. That "great" is predicated of good, and "numerous" of truth, appears from other places in the Word, but I must refrain from citing them here. The derivative truth, that is, truth 
from good, in the genuine sense is spiritual good. There are two kinds of good that are distinct from each other, namely, celestial good and spiritual good. Celestial good is that of love to the Lord, 
spiritual good is that of love toward the neighbor. From the former, or celestial good, comes the latter, or spiritual good; for no one can love the Lord unless he also loves his neighbor. In love 
to the Lord is love toward the neighbor; for love to the Lord is from the Lord, and thus is from love itself toward the universal human race. To be in love to the Lord is the same as to be in the Lord; 
and he who is in the Lord cannot be otherwise than in His love; which is toward the human race and thus toward the neighbor; thus is he in both kinds of good, celestial and spiritual. The former is 
the veriest good itself; but the latter is its truth, or the truth therefrom; which truth is spiritual good, as said. The former is what is signified by "great," but the latter by "numerous." </p>

That 'Abraham will certainly become a great and numerous nation' means that from the Lord will come all good, and from this all truth, is clear from the representation of 'Abraham' as the Lord, dealt 
with often above, and also from the meaning of 'nation' as good, dealt with in <a href="1159.htm">1159</a>, <a href="1258.htm">1258</a>-<a href="1260.htm">1260</a>, <a href="1416.htm">1416</a>, <a href="1849.htm">1849</a> - here 'a great and numerous nation', by which good and truth deriving from it are meant. That 
'great' has reference to good and 'numerous' to truth may become clear from other places in the Word, but I must refrain from quoting them here. Truth derived from good is in the genuine sense spiritual 
good, for there are two kinds of good, quite distinct and separate from each other, namely celestial good and spiritual good. Celestial good is the manifestation of love to the Lord, spiritual good 
the manifestation of love towards the neighbour. From the former, that is, celestial good, flows the latter, that is, spiritual good; for no one is able to love the Lord unless he also loves the neighbour. 
Love to the Lord embraces love towards the neighbour, for love to the Lord originates in the Lord, thus in Love itself towards the whole human race. Abiding in love to the Lord is the same as 
abiding in the Lord, and one who abides in the Lord must inevitably abide in His love which is directed towards the human race, and thus towards the neighbour, so that in him both kinds of good are 
present - both celestial and spiritual. Celestial good is indeed good itself, but spiritual good is in fact truth that goes with or is derived from that celestial good. This truth, as stated, is spiritual 
good. It is celestial good that is meant by 'greet', but spiritual good by 'numerous'. </p>

</p><b>2227.</b>
Quod `Abraham (x)essendo erit in gentem magnam et numerosam' significet quod a Domino erit omne bonum et omne verum inde, constat a repraesentatione `Abrahami' quod sit Dominus, de qua saepius supra; 
tum a significatione `gentis' quod sit bonum, de qua n. 1159, 1258-1260, 1416, 1849, hic `gentis magnae et numerosae,' qua significatur bonum et verum inde; quod {1} `magnum' praedicetur de bono et 
`numerosum' de vero, ex locis aliis in Verbo constare potest, sed illa nunc adducere, supersedendum.  Verum inde seu verum ex bono, in sensu genuino est bonum spirituale: sunt duo bona inter se distincta, 
nempe bonum caeleste et bonum spirituale; bonum caeleste est amoris in Dominum, bonum spirituale est amoris erga proximum; ex illo bono seu caelesti est hoc seu spirituale, nam nemo amare potest 
Dominum, nisi etiam amet proximum; in amore in Dominum est amor erga proximum; nam amor in Dominum est a Domino, ita ab Ipso Amore erga diversum genus humanum; in amore in Dominum esse, est idem ac esse 
in Domino, et qui in Domino, non potest aliter quam esse in amore Ipsius qui est erga genus humanum, ita erga proximum; ita est ille in utroque bono, nempe in caelesti et spirituali, illud est ipsissimum 
bonum, hoc autem verum ejus seu verum inde, quod verum est bonum spirituale, ut dictum; illud est quod significatur per `magnum,' hoc autem per `numerosum.' 	@1 i `gens magna' est bonum, et `gens 
numerosa' est verum inde.$ </p>
