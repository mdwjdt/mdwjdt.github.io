<h3 align="center" class="ired">属天的奥秘 第3376节</h3>
<h4 align="center"></h4><p><strong>3376.</strong>这两节的内义是：当神圣真理经由理性事物流入时，它会产生真理的表象，从而使良善结出硕果，使真理繁多，主通过这些良善与真理将自己与天使并世人联结起来。这两节的整体含义无法从对它们的初步解释看出来，也就是说，无法从3366节的内容看出来，即：出自神性的思维不要求助于记忆知识，而要求助于被神性启示后而成为真理表象的理性事物；来自神性的教导，以及一个增长，因而良善与真理，就是主藉以与其圣言中的事物相联结的属灵事物，便从这些理性事物而来。这些含义在世人看来似乎彼此无关，但在内义上却被完美地联结起来。在天使眼里，也就是在天堂，它们以最优美的顺序显现并被察觉，并且具有无法形容的多样性。这就是在其内义中的整个圣言。</p>

<p align="center"><b>Potts(1905-1910) 3376</b></p><p><b>3376.</b>
The internal sense of these two verses is that when the Divine truth flows in by rational things, it presents appearances of truth, and thus fructifies and multiplies itself in respect to the good and 
truth through which the Lord conjoins Himself with angels and men. That this is the sense cannot be seen from the first exposition wherein everything is scattered, that is to say, from what was said 
in n. 3366-that there was thought from the Divine not to go down to memory-knowledges, but to rational things which when enlightened by the Divine are appearances of truth, and that from these would 
come instruction from the Divine, and increase, thus good and truth, which are spiritual, whereby there is conjunction of the Lord with the things in His Word. These things which before man appear thus 
scattered, are yet in the internal sense conjoined together in the most orderly manner, and before the angels, or in heaven, appear and are perceived in a most beautiful series and connection; nay, 
are attended with angelic representatives in a heavenly form; and this with inexpressible variety. Such is the Word throughout in its internal sense. </p>

<p align="center"><b>Elliott(1983-1999) 3376</b></p><p><b>3376.</b>
The internal sense of these two verses is that when Divine Truth flows in by way of rational concepts it produces appearances of truth and so causes good to be fruitful and truth to be multiplied, and 
by means of these the Lord joins Himself to angels and men. This overall meaning of the two verses cannot be seen from the initial explanation of them where the several meanings appear to be unrelated 
to one another, that is to say, from the following in <a href="3366.htm">3366</a> - There was thought coming from the Divine about not resorting to facts but to rational concepts which, when enlightened from the Divine, 
are appearances of truth; and from this came instruction from the Divine, and an increase, and so good and truth, which are spiritual things by means of which the Lord is joined to the things that are 
in His Word. But those meanings which to man's eyes seem so unrelated to one another are nevertheless perfectly co-ordinated in the internal sense. And to angels' eyes, that is, in heaven, they appear 
and are perceived in a most beautiful sequence, accompanied indeed by angelic representations that occur in a heavenly form, and with indescribable variation. Such is the Word in every part in its internal sense. </p>

Sensus internus binorum horum versuum est quod Divinum Verum cum influit per rationalia, sistat apparentias veri, ac ita fructificet {1}et multiplicet se quoad bonum et verum, per quae Dominus (t)conjungit 
Se cum angelis et hominibus: quod hic sensus sit, non videri potest {2}ex prima expositione, ubi sparsa {3}apparent, nempe ex his quae n. 3366, Quod ex Divino cogitatio fuerit, ne ad scientifica 
sed ad rationalia quae a Divino illustrata sunt apparentiae veri, et quod inde instructio ex Divino, ac incrementum, ita bonum et verum quae spiritualia, per quae conjunctio Domini {4}cum illis quae 
in Verbo Ipsius; sed haec quae ita sparsa apparent coram homine, sunt usque in sensu interno ordinatissime conjuncta, et coram angelis seu in caelo apparent et percipiuntur in pulcherrima serie, immo 
cum repraesentativis angelicis in forma caelesti {5}, et hoc cum varietate ineffabili: tale est Verbum ubivis in sensu suo interno. @1 se et multiplicet I$  @2 in$  @3 sunt$  @4 illis qui in regno 
Ipsius$  @5 i in qua Divinum a Domino$  </p>
