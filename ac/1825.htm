<h3 align="center" class="ired">属天的奥秘 第1825节</h3>
<h4 align="center"></h4><p><strong>1825.</strong>“三岁”象征就时期和状态而言教会的一切事物。这从圣言中“三”的含义清楚可知。“三”表示教会从开始到结束的整个时期，以及它的全部状态。因此，教会的末期用第三日，第三周，第三个月，第三年，或第三个十年来表示，它们的意思都一样。由于教会的状态用数字三来表示，故每一个为教会的个体的状态，以及作为该教会一部分的一切事物也是由数字三来表示的。这从该数字在上述圣言经文中的含义（<a href="720.htm">720</a>，<a href="901.htm">901</a>节）可以看出来。<br />因此，“三岁的母牛犊”表示教会的整个时期或状态，甚至直到它的终结，也就是说当它荒凉或荒废时的状态。这一点也清楚可见于以赛亚书：<br />我的心为摩押哀号，他的逃民逃到琐珥，如同一头三岁大的牝牛，他登上鲁希的山坡，随走随哭，他们在何罗念的路上，发出灭亡的哀号。（以赛亚书<a href="http://39-27.cn/赛15.5.htm">15:5</a>）<br />还有耶利米书：<br />迦密和摩押地的欢喜快乐都被夺去，我使酒榨的酒绝流，无人踹酒欢呼；那欢呼却不是欢呼。希实本的哀叫传到以利亚利，他们发出的声音传到雅杂，从琐珥达到何罗念，如同一头三岁大的牝牛，因为宁林的水必然干涸。（耶利米书<a href="http://39-27.cn/耶48.33.htm">48:33</a>，<a href="http://39-27.cn/耶48.34.htm">34</a>）<br />若不知道“摩押”、“琐珥”、“鲁希的山坡”、“希实本的哀叫传到以利亚利”、“雅杂”、“何罗念”、“宁林的水”、“三岁大的牝牛”各表示什么，就没人能理解这些细节的含义。显而易见，这表示最终的荒废。</p>

<p><strong>[NCE]1825.</strong> The fact that three years old covers all eras and conditions of religion can be seen from the symbolism of three in the Word. Three symbolizes an entire religious era from beginning to end, so it symbolizes every state along the way. Consequently the end of a religious era is symbolized by a third day, week, month, year, or age,{*1} which all mean the same thing.<br />Just as the number three symbolizes the condition of religion, it also symbolizes conditions in a religious person and in fact the condition of any feature of religion. This can be seen from the meaning of that number in the scriptural passages quoted in <a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_1825/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_720" target=_top>720</a>, <a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_1825/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_901" target=_top>901</a>.<br />[2] This symbolism of a three-year-old heifer as an era or state of religion all the way to its end (when it has been devastated or stripped bare inwardly) can also be seen in Isaiah:<br />My heart cries out over Moab; those who flee it as far as Zoar are a three-year-old heifer. For they will ascend in tears on the ascent to Luhith, since on the way to Horonaim they will raise a cry for the wreckage. (<a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_1825/bible_king-james-version_isaiah_15_5" target=_top>Isaiah 15:5</a>)<br />And in Jeremiah:<br />Gladness and exultation have disappeared from Carmel and from the land of Moab; and wine from the winepresses I will put an end to. No one will tread the hedad; the hedad will not be a hedad.{*2} From the cry of Heshbon all the way to Elealeh, all the way to Jahaz, they have uttered their voice, from Zoar all the way to Horonaim — a three-year-old heifer; because the waters of Nimrim will also become wastelands. (<a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_1825/bible_king-james-version_jeremiah_48_33-34" target=_top>Jeremiah 48:33-34</a>)<br />No one could ever tell what these words mean without knowing what is symbolized by Moab, Zoar, the ascent to Luhith, the cry of Heshbon to Elealeh, Jahaz, Horonaim, the waters of Nimrim, and the three-year-old heifer; although it is clear that they depict final devastation.{*3} <br /><strong>Footnotes:</strong><br />{*1} The Latin word here translated "age" is saeculum, which in Swedenborg's usage can refer to a decade (see <a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_1825/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_433" target=_top>433</a>), a century, or an even longer period. In Christian texts the word is sometimes translated "the world," that is, the current dispensation of time as a whole. See Lewis and Short 1879, under saeculum. [LHC, RS]<br />{*2} On the Hebrew word hedad, see note 4 in <a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_1825/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_971" target=_top>971</a>. The idea is that there will be no grape-treading and no jubilant shouting to accompany it. [LHC]<br />{*3} For more on the inner meaning of Moab, see <a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_1825/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_2468#subsection-2-7" target=_top>2468:7-11</a>, <a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_1825/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_17" target=_top>17</a>; <a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_1825/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_8315" target=_top>8315</a>. On Zoar, see <a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_1825/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_1589" target=_top>1589</a>, <a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_1825/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_2429#subsection-2-4" target=_top>2429:4</a>. Although Swedenborg never fully explains in one place the meaning of the cry of Heshbon to Elealeh, he does later provide separate clues to the meanings of Heshbon, Elealeh, and the cry itself; see Revelation Explained (Swedenborg 1994-1997a) <a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_1825/swedenborg_apocalypse-explained-whitehead_393" target=_top>393</a>, <a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_1825/swedenborg_apocalypse-explained-whitehead_435#subsection-2-7" target=_top>435:7</a>, <a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_1825/swedenborg_apocalypse-explained-whitehead_911#subsection-2-10" target=_top>911:10</a>. The specific meanings of the ascent to Luhith, Jahaz, Horonaim, and the waters of Nimrim are not given by Swedenborg. [SS, LSW] </p>

That "three years old" involves all things of the church as to times and states, is evident from the signification of "three" in the Word. By "three" is signified the full time of the church, from its 
origin even to its end, and thus all its state. The last time of the church is therefore signified by the third day, the third week, the third month, the third year and the third age, which are all 
the same. As the state of the church is signified by the number three, so also is the state of everyone who is a church, and everything which is of the church, as may be seen from the signification of 
this number in the passages adduced from the Word (n. 720, 901).  [2] That "a heifer of three years" thus signifies the time or state of the church even to the last, that is, when it has been vastated 
or made desolate, may also be seen in Isaiah: </p>
<p>     My heart crieth out upon Moab; her fugitives are unto Zoar, a heifer of three years old; for by the ascent of Luhith, with weeping he shall go up 
in it; for in the way of Horonaim they shall raise up a cry of breaking to pieces (Isa. 15:5). Also in Jeremiah: </p>
<p>     Gladness and exultation are gathered from Carmel, and from the land of Moab; and 
I will make* wine to cease from the winepresses; none shall tread with shouting; the shouting shall be no shouting. From the cry of Heshbon even unto Elealeh, even unto Jahaz have they uttered their 
voice, from Zoar even unto** Horonaim, a heifer of three years old; for the waters of Nimrim also shall become desolations (Jer. 48:33-34). No one could possibly perceive what these things mean unless 
he knew what is signified by "Moab," by "Zoar," "the ascent of Luhith," "the cry of Heshbon unto Elealeh," by "Jahaz," by "Horonaim," "the waters of Nimrim," and by "a heifer three years old." That 
this is an uttermost vastation is plain. * Cessare faciam; but elsewhere feci, as Apocalypse Explained 376. [Rotch ed.] ** Latin here has a, doubtless a misprint for ad, as in n. 9391. [Ibid.] </p>

<p align="center"><b>Elliott(1983-1999) 1825</b></p><p><b>1825.</b>
That 'three years old' embodies all things of the Church as to periods and states is clear from the meaning of 'three' in the Word. Three means the whole time of the Church from start to finish, and 
so its total state. The final phase of the Church is therefore meant by the third day, by the third week, by the third month, by the third year, or by the third decade,<A name="fntext1"></a><A href="#fn1"><sup>a</sup></a> all having the same meaning. As 
the state of the Church is meant by the number three, so also is the state of every individual who is a Church, and indeed everything that is part of the Church, as becomes clear from the meaning of 
that number in the places quoted from the Word in <a href="720.htm">720</a>, <a href="901.htm">901</a>. </p>
<p></p>
<p><b>[2]</b>
 That 'a three year old heifer' accordingly means the whole time or state of the Church even to its end, that is to say, when it has 
been vastated, or laid desolate, also becomes clear in Isaiah, </p>
<blockquote>
My heart cries out upon Moab, his fugitives flee even to Zoar, a three year old heifer, for at the ascent of Luhith he will go up weeping, 
for on the road to Horonaim they will raise a cry of ruination. <a href="http://bible.gospelcom.net/cgi-bin/bible?passage=Isa%2015:5&amp;version=ESV&amp;interface=print&amp;showfn=yes&amp;showxref">Isa 15:5</a>. 
</blockquote>
<p>Also in Jeremiah, </p>
<blockquote>
Gladness and exultation have been plucked from Carmel, and from the land of Moab, and I will make 
the wine cease from the winepresses. None will tread the hedad; the hedad will not be a hedad.<A name="fntext2"></a><A href="#fn2"><sup>b</sup></a> From the cry of Heshbon even to Elealeh, as far as Jahaz they uttered their voice, from Zoar even to 
Horonaim, a three year old heifer, for the waters of Nimrim also will become desolations. <a href="http://bible.gospelcom.net/cgi-bin/bible?passage=Jer%2048:33,%2034&amp;version=ESV&amp;interface=print&amp;showfn=yes&amp;showxref">Jer 48:33, 34</a>. 
</blockquote>
<p>Nobody could possibly perceive what these details mean unless he knew what is meant by Moab, 
Zoar, the ascent of Luhith, the shout of Heshbon even to Elealeh, Jahaz, Horonaim, the waters of Nimrim, and a three year old heifer. That a final vastation is meant is plainly evident.
