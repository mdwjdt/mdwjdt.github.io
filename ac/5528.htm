Verses 35-38. And it came to pass as they emptied their sacks, and behold everyone's bundle of silver was in his sack; and they saw the bundles of their silver, they and their father, and they were afraid. 
And Jacob their father said unto them, Me have ye bereaved, Joseph is not, and Simeon is not, and ye will take Benjamin; all these things will be upon me. And Reuben spoke unto his father, saying, 
Slay my two sons if I bring him not to thee; give him upon my hand, and I will bring him unto thee again. And he said, My son shall not go down with you; for his brother is dead, and he only is left; 
and mischief will befall him in the way wherein ye shall go, and ye will make my gray hairs go down in sorrow to the grave. "And it came to pass as they emptied their sacks," signifies use from the 
truths in the natural; "and behold everyone's bundle of silver," signifies settings in order of truths bestowed gratis; "was in his sack," signifies in the receptacle of each; "and they saw the bundles 
of their silver," signifies perception that it was so; "they and their father," signifies from truths and the good of truth in the natural; "and they were afraid," signifies what is holy; "and Jacob 
their father said unto them," signifies perception in them from the good of truth; "Me have ye bereaved," signifies that thus the church was no more; "Joseph is not," signifies that there is no internal; 
"and Simeon is not," signifies that neither is there faith in the will; "and ye will take Benjamin," signifies if the intermediate also is taken away; "all these things will be upon me," signifies 
that thus what is of the church will be destroyed; "and Reuben spoke unto his father," signifies the things of faith in the understanding perceived from the good of truth; "saying, Slay my two sons," 
signifies that neither kind of faith will live; "if I bring him not to thee," signifies unless an intermediate be adjoined; "give him upon my hand," signifies so far as was in its power; "and I will 
bring him unto thee again," signifies that it shall be restored; "and he said, My son shall not go down with you," signifies that it will not let itself down toward lower things; "for his brother is 
dead," signifies because the internal is not present; "and he only is left," signifies that it is now in place of the internal; "and mischief will befall him in the way wherein ye shall go," signifies 
that with truths alone in the natural, separated from the internal, it would perish; "and ye will make my gray hairs go down," signifies that this will be the last of the church; "in sorrow to the 
grave," signifies without hope of resuscitation. </p>

Verses 35-38 And so it was, as they were emptying their sacks, that behold, each man's bundle of silver was in his sack; and they saw their bundles of silver, they and their father, and they were afraid. 
And Jacob their father said to them, You have bereaved me [of my children]; Joseph is not, and Simeon is not, and you take Benjamin. All these things will be upon me. And Reuben said to his father 
- he said, Make my two sons die if I do not bring him back to you; give him into my hand, and I will bring him back to you. And he said, My son shall not go down with you, for his brother is dead, and 
he, he alone, is left. And should harm happen to him on the road on which you go, you will cause my grey hair to go down in sorrow to the grave. </p>
<p>'And so it was, as they were emptying their sacks' 
means the use performed by truths in the natural. 'That behold, each man's bundle of silver' means truths in ordered groups freely given. 'Was in his sack' means in each one's receptacle. 'And they 
saw their bundles of silver means a discernment that this was so. 'They and their father' means by the truths and the good of truth in the natural. 'And they were afraid' means a holy influence. 'And 
Jacob their father said to them' means a perception that came to them from the good of truth. 'You have bereaved me [of my children]' means that thus no Church existed any longer. 'Joseph is not' means 
that the internal does not exist: 'And Simeon is not' means that faith in the will does not exist either. 'And you take Benjamin' means if the intermediary also is taken away. 'All these things will 
be upon me' means that, when this is so, that which constitutes the Church will have been destroyed. 'And Reuben said to his father' means matters of faith present in the understanding were discerned 
by the good of truth. 'He said, Make my two sons die' means that neither of the two kinds of faith will survive. 'If I do not bring him back to you' means if no joining of the intermediary takes place. 
'Give him into my hand' means insofar as it was in its power. 'And I will bring him to you' means that it will be restored. 'And he said, My son shall not go down with you' means that it will not move 
down towards inferior things. 'For his brother is dead' means because the internal is not present. 'And he, he alone, is left' means that this one now exists in place of the internal. 'And should 
harm happen to him on the road on which you go' means that, when in the company of truths alone in the natural that have been separated from the internal, it will perish. 'You will cause my grey hair 
to go down' means that this will accordingly be the final phase of the Church. 'In sorrow to the grave' means without hope of a restoration to life. </p>

Vers. 35-38.  Et fuit, illi evacuantes saccos suos, et ecce cuivis colligatio argenti sui in sacco suo, et videbant colligationes argenti illorum illi et pater illorum, et timuerunt. Et dixit ad illos 
Jacob pater illorum, Me orbavistis Joseph non est, et Shimeon non est, et Benjaminem sumitis; super me erunt omnia haec.  Et dixit Reuben ad patrem suum, dicendo, Duos filios meos mori facias, nisi 
adduxero illum ad te, da illum super manum meam et ego reducam illum ad te.  Et dixit, Non descendet filius meus vobiscum, quia frater illius mortuus, et ille solus is relictus, et obveniat illi damnum 
in via qua ibitis in illa, et descendere facietis canitiem meam in maerore sepulcrum.  `Et fuit, illi evacuantes saccos suos' significat usum ex veris quae in naturali: `et ecce cuivis colligatio argenti 
sui' significat ordinationes verorum donatas gratis: `in sacco suo' significat in cujusvis receptaculo: `et videbant colligationes argenti illorum' significat apperceptionem quod ita: `illi et 
pater illorum' significat a veris et bono veri in naturali: `et timuerunt'  significat sanctum: et dixit ad illos Jacob pater illorum' significat perceptionem illis a bono veri: `Me orbavistis' significat 
quod sic non Ecclesia magis: `Joseph non est' significat internum quod non sit: `et Shimeon non est' significat fides voluntate quod nec sit: `et Benjaminem sumitis' significat si etiam medium aufertur: 
`super  me erunt omnia haec{1}' significat quod sic destructum erit id quod est Ecclesiae: `et dixit Reuben ad patrem suum' significat illa quae fidei intellectu sunt appercepta a bono veri: `dicendo, 
Duos filios meos mori facias' significat quod fidei utrumque nec victurum: `nisi adduxero illum ad te' significat nisi medium `conjungatur: `da illum super manum meam' significat quantum in sua 
potentia: `et ego adducam {2} illum ad te' significat quod restituetur: `et dixit, Non descendet filius meus vobiscum' significat quod non demittet se versus inferiora: `quia frater illius mortuus' 
significat quoniam internum non adest; `et ille solus (x)is relictus' significat quod is loco interni nunc: `et obveniat illi damnum in via qua ibitis in illa' significat quod cum solis veris in naturali 
separatis ab interno, periturum: `et descendere facietis canitiem meam' significat quod sic erit ultimum Ecclesiae: `in maerore sepulcrum' significat absque spe resuscitationis. @1 A I o haec here
