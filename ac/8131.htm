<h3 align="center" class="ired">属天的奥秘 第8131节</h3>
<h4 align="center"></h4><p><strong>8131.</strong>“你要对着它靠近海边安营”表试探的流注来自那里。这从“对着它”、“安营”和“红海”的含义清楚可知：“对着它”是指足够接近，以至于它在视野之内，在内义上是指足够接近，以至于流注来自那里；“安营”是指对为经历试探的真理和良善的有序排列，如刚才所述（参看<a href="8130.htm">8130</a>节）；“红海”是指邪恶所生的虚假盛行的地狱（<a href="8099.htm">8099</a>节）。必须简要说明当如何理解试探的流注来自那里。一个人所经历的试探就是恶灵与善灵之间的属灵争战，这些争战是由此人所做过和思想过、存于他记忆中的事物产生，并与这些事物有关。恶灵会指控并攻击，但善灵则宽恕并保卫。这些争战看似在人里面，因为从灵界流入一个人的事物不是表现为来自灵界的某种事物，而是表现为在他里面的某种事物（<a href="741.htm">741</a>，<a href="751.htm">751</a>，<a href="761.htm">761</a>，<a href="1820.htm">1820</a>，<a href="3927.htm">3927</a>，<a href="4249.htm">4249</a>，<a href="4307.htm">4307</a>，<a href="4572.htm">4572</a>，<a href="5036.htm">5036</a>，<a href="6657.htm">6657</a>，<a href="6666.htm">6666</a>节）。当他们经历试探时，类似情况就存在于灵人身上。因此，当人们即将经历试探时，他们里面的内层事物，也就是真理和良善就被主重新排列成这样一种状态：通过来自祂自己的直接流注和经由天堂而来的间接流注可以抵制来自地狱的虚假和邪恶，经历试探的人由此能得到保护。当一个人正经受试探时，他也离地狱很近，尤其离“红海”所表示的地狱很近，因为那些拥有真理的记忆知识，却过着一种邪恶生活，由此陷入邪恶所生的虚假之人就住在这个地狱里。那些在试探中给人带来焦虑的事物就是从地狱经由灵人而来的。由此可见，“对着它靠近红海安营”所表示的来自地狱的试探流注是什么意思。</p>

Over against it shall ye encamp by the sea. That this signifies that the influx of temptation is thence, is evident from the signification of "over against it," as being near, so as to be in sight, and 
in the internal sense so that there was influx thence; and from the signification of "encamping," as being the setting in order of truth and good for the undergoing of temptations (as just above, see 
n. 8130); and from the signification of "the sea Suph," as being the hell where are falsities from evils (n. 8099). How it is to be understood that the influx of temptation was from there shall be 
briefly told. Temptations with man are spiritual combats between evil and good spirits, which combats are from those things and concerning those things which the man has done and thought, and which are 
in his memory. The evil spirits accuse and attack; but the good excuse and defend. These combats appear as if in the man, for the things which flow in from the spiritual world with a man are not presented 
as being from that world, but in himself (n. 741, 751, 761, 1820, 3927, 4249, 4307, 4572, 5036, 6657, 6666). It is the same with spirits when they undergo temptations. Therefore when people are 
about to undergo temptations, the interior things in them, that is, the truths and goods, are arranged by the Lord into such a state that by immediate influx from Himself and mediate influx through heaven, 
the falsities and evils which are from the hells may be resisted, and thereby he who is in temptation may be protected. When a man is being tempted he is also near hell, especially near that hell 
which is signified by "the sea Suph," for in this hell are they who have been in the memory-knowledge of truth but in a life of evil, and thereby in falsities derived from evil. From the hells, through 
spirits, those things flow in which bring anxiety upon man in temptations. From all this it can be seen what is meant by the influx of temptation from hell, which is signified by their "encamping 
over against it by the sea Suph." </p>

<p align="center"><b>Elliott(1983-1999) 8131</b></p><p><b>8131.</b>
'Over against it you are to encamp, close to the sea' means that the influx of temptation comes from there. This is clear from the meaning of 'over against it' as close enough for it to be within view, 
in the internal sense close enough for the influx to come from there; from the meaning of 'encamping' as the arrangement of truth and good for undergoing temptations, as immediately above in <a href="8130.htm">8130</a>; 
and from the meaning of 'the Sea Suph' as the hell where falsities arising from evils prevail, dealt with in <a href="8099.htm">8099</a>. How one should understand the explanation that the influx of temptation comes from there 
must be stated briefly. The temptations a person undergoes are spiritual conflicts between evil spirits and good ones. The conflicts arise from and have to do with the things the person has done or 
thought, recorded in his memory. The evil spirits incriminate and attack, but the good ones pardon and defend. It appears as though those conflicts are within the person, for what flows into a person 
from the spiritual world presents itself not as something from there but as something inside him, see <a href="741.htm">741</a>, <a href="751.htm">751</a>, <a href="761.htm">761</a>, <a href="1820.htm">1820</a>, <a href="3927.htm">3927</a>, <a href="4249.htm">4249</a>, <a href="4307.htm">4307</a>, <a href="4572.htm">4572</a>, <a href="5036.htm">5036</a>, <a href="6657.htm">6657</a>, <a href="6666.htm">6666</a>. A similar situation exists with spirits 
when they undergo temptations. When therefore they are about to undergo temptations interior things residing with them, that is, the truths and forms of good, are rearranged by the Lord into a 
condition which is such that by means of direct influx from Himself, and indirect influx through heaven, resistance can be offered to the falsities and evils coming from the hells, and in that way the 
one undergoing temptation can be protected. When a person is tempted he is also close to hell, in particular to this hell that is meant by 'the Sea Suph'; for its inhabitants are people who had a knowledge 
of truth but led a life of evil, and are consequently ruled by falsities arising from evil. From the hells through evil spirits come those influences which lead to the anxiety experienced by a 
person in temptations. From all this one may see what one should understand by the influx of temptation from hell, meant by the command the people received to encamp over against it, close to the Sea Suph. </p>

`E regione ejus castrametemini juxta mare': quod significet quod inde tentationis influxus, constat ex significatione `e regione ejus' quod sit juxta ut in conspectu, in sensu interno, ut inde influxus; 
ex significatione `castrametari' quod sit ordinatio veri et boni ad subeundas tentationes, ut nunc supra n. 8130; et ex significatione `maris Suph' quod sit infernum ubi falsa ex malis, de qua n. 
8099.  Quomodo intelligendum quod inde tentationis influxus, paucis (x)dicetur: tentationes apud hominem sunt pugnae spirituales inter malos spiritus et inter bonos; {1}pugnae sunt ex illis et de illis 
quae homo egerat et cogitaverat, quae in ejus memoria; mali spiritus incusant et aggrediuntur, {2}boni autem excusant et defendunt; {3}pugnae illae apparent sicut in homine, nam quae ex spirituali 
mundo apud hominem influunt sistuntur sicut non inde sed in ipso, videatur n. 741, 751, 761, 1820, 3927, 4249, 4307, 4572, 5036, 6657, 6666; similiter se habet cum spiritibus cum subeunt tentationes; 
cum itaque subituri sunt tentationes, disponuntur apud illos interiora, hoc est, vera et bona, a Domino in illum statum, ut per influxum immediatum ab Ipso, ac mediatum per caelum, resisti queant falsa 
et mala quae ab infernis, et sic ille qui est in tentatione tutari; homo cum tentatur etiam juxta infernum est, imprimis juxta hoc infernum quod significatur per `mare Suph,' nam {4}ibi sunt illi qui 
in scientia veri fuerunt sed in vita mali, et inde {5} in falsis ex malo; ex infernis per spiritus {6} influunt illa quae anxietatem inducunt homini in tentationibus; ex his constare potest quid intelligitur 
per tentationis influxum ab inferno, qui significatur per quod `e regione castrametarentur juxta mare Suph.' 	@1 qui apud hominem, illi$ 	@2 hi$ 	@3 apparent illae$ 	@4 in hoc inferno$ 	@5
