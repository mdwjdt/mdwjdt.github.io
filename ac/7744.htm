<h3 align="center" class="ired">属天的奥秘 第7744节</h3>
<h4 align="center"></h4><p><strong>7744.</strong>有一个灵人在我头上和我说话。从他的声调就发觉，他似乎处于睡眠状态。他在这种状态下问了我几个问题，他所问的问题如此理智，以致一个完全醒着的人也问不出比这更理智的问题了。我得以发觉，他是一个使臣，天使正通过他说话；在那种状态下，他能领悟并复述他们所说的话；因为除了真理外，他什么也不说。若任何东西从某个其它源头流入，他的确接受它，但不会复述它。我向他询问他的状态。他说，这种状态对他来说是一种平安的状态，对未来完全没有任何忧虑；而与此同时，他也提供了有用的服务，由此与天堂接触。我被告知，像他这样的人在大人里面与大脑的矢状窦有关，矢状窦位于脑里面的两个脑半球之间；在那里处于平静状态，无论脑两边如何被干扰。</p>

There was a certain one above my head, who spoke to me, and from the tone of his voice it was noticed that he was as in a state of sleep. Speaking in this state he asked several questions, and so discreetly, 
that he could not have asked them more discreetly if he had been awake. It was given to perceive that he was a subject through whom angels were speaking; and in that state he discerned what they 
spoke, and uttered it; for he spoke nothing but what was true. If anything flowed in from another source, he indeed admitted it, but did not utter it. I questioned him concerning his state. He said 
that this state was to him a peaceful one, and that it was free from all anxiety as to the future; and that at the same time he was performing uses, whereby he had communication with heaven. I was told 
that such in the Grand Man have relation to the longitudinal sinus, which lies in the cerebrum between its two hemispheres, and is there in a quiet state, however much the brain is disturbed on both sides. </p>

There was once above my head a certain spirit who talked to me. From the sound of his voice I detected that he was in a trance-like state. Talking in this state he asked me many things; and what he asked 
was so sensible that a person fully awake could not have spoken more sensibly. I was allowed to perceive that he was a subordinate through whom angels spoke, and that while in that state he apprehended 
what they said and reproduced it; for he uttered nothing except what was true. If anything flowed from some other source he did indeed take it in, but he did not reproduce it. I asked him about 
his state. He said that that state was for him a peaceful one, devoid of all anxiety about things to come, while at the same time he performed useful services, which put him in contact with heaven. I 
was told that people like him in the Grand Man correlate with the vertical cleft which is situated in the brain between its two hemispheres and is in a state of tranquillity no matter how much turmoil 
there may be in the brain on either side. </p>

Erat quidam supra caput meum qui mecum locutus est; ex sono {1}appercipiebatur quasi in statu somni esset; in hoc statu loquens interrogabat plura, et {2}haec tali prudentia ut vigil non prudentius; 
percipere dabatur quod subjectum esset per quod angeli loquerentur; et is in statu illo apperciperet id et produceret; non enim loquebatur nisi quod verum erat; si aliunde quid influeret, quidem admittebat, 
sed non producebat. Interrogavi illum de statu suo: dicebat quod status ille ei esset status pacificus, et quod esset absque omni sollicitudine {3} de futuris; et quod simul usus praestaret, per 
quos ei communicatio cum caelo.  Dictum (t)mihi est quod tales in Maximo Homine referant sinum longitudinalem qui in cerebro inter bina ejus hemisphaeria jacet, et ibi in statu quieto utcumque tumultuatur 
cerebrum utrinque. 	@1 percipiebatur$ 	@2 hoc$ 	@3 i et cura$ </p>
