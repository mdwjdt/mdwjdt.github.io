The Internal Sense. Verses 1-3. And Joseph fell upon the faces of his father, and wept upon him, and kissed him. And Joseph commanded his servants the physicians to embalm his father; and the physicians 
embalmed Israel. And forty days were fulfilled for him, for so are fulfilled the days of the embalmed; and the Egyptians wept for him seventy days. "And Joseph fell upon the faces of his father," 
signifies the influx of the internal into the affection of good; "and wept upon him," signifies sorrow; "and kissed him," signifies the first conjunction; "and Joseph commanded his servants the physicians," 
signifies preservation from the evils which hindered; "to embalm his father," signifies lest it should be infected with any contagion; "and the physicians embalmed Israel," signifies what was 
done for the preservation of the good which is from truth; "and forty days were fulfilled for him," signifies states of preparation by means of temptations; "for so are fulfilled the days of the embalmed," 
signifies that these are states of preservation; "and the Egyptians wept for him," signifies the sadness of the memory-knowledges of the church; "seventy days," signifies a full state. </p>

THE INTERNAL SENSE </p>
<p>Verses 1-3 And Joseph fell upon his father's face, and wept on him, and kissed him. And Joseph commanded his servants the physicians to embalm his father; and the physicians embalmed 
Israel. And forty days were completed for him; for thus are completed the days of embalming. And the Egyptians wept for him seventy days. </p>
<p>'And Joseph fell upon his father's face' means an influx 
of the internal into the affection for good. 'And wept on him' means sorrow. 'And kissed him' means an initial joining together. 'And Joseph commanded his servants the physicians' means preservation 
from evils which would hinder it. 'To embalm his father' means to prevent it from being ruined by any corruption. 'And the physicians embalmed Israel' means the action taken to preserve good springing 
from truth. 'And forty days were completed for him' means states of preparation through temptations. 'For thus are completed the days of embalming' means that they are states of preservation. 'And 
the Egyptians wept for him' means sadness on the part of the Church's factual knowledge. 'Seventy days' means a complete state. </p>

SENSUS INTERNUS </p>
<p>Vers. 1-3.  Et cecidit Joseph super facies patris sui, et flevit super illo, et osculatus illum.  Et praecepit Joseph servis suis medicis ad condiendum patrem suum; et condierunt 
medici Israelem.  Et impleti ei quadraginta dies, quia ita implentur dies conditorum; et fleverunt illum Aegyptii septuaginta dies.  `Et cecidit Joseph super facies patris sui' significat influxum interni 
in affectionem boni:  `et flevit super illo' significat maestitiam: `et osculatus illum' significat conjunctionem primam:  `et praecepit Joseph servis suis medicis' significat praeservationem a malis 
quae impedirent:  `ad condiendum patrem suum' significat ne inficiatur aliquo contagio:  `et condierunt medici Israelem' significat effectum ad praeservandum bonum quod ex vero:  `et impleti ei quadraginta 
dies' significat status praeparationis per tentationes:  `quia ita implentur dies conditorum' significat quod illi status praeservationis sint:  `et fleverunt illum Aegyptii' significat tristitiam 
scientificorum Ecclesiae:  `septuaginta dies' significat statum plenum.     </p>
