<h3 align="center" class="ired">属天的奥秘 第7032节</h3>
<h4 align="center"></h4><p><strong>7032.</strong>“我却要使他的心刚硬，他必不放百姓走”表顽固，因而仍不释放。这从“刚硬”、“心”和“不放百姓走”的含义清楚可知：“刚硬”是指顽固；“心”是指意愿（参看<a href="2930.htm">2930</a>，<a href="3888.htm">3888</a>节），因此，此处这些话表示源于意愿，因而源于作恶之乐的顽固，因为存在于意愿里的东西是令人快乐的，而令人快乐的东西源于人所拥有的爱；“不放百姓走”是指不愿释放的顽固，因而是指仍不释放。在此处和下文，经上都说到“耶和华使法老的心刚硬”。这种说法是基于表象和对神性的普遍观念，即一切事都是祂做的。不过，理解这句话，和理解将邪恶、怒气、烈怒、毁灭，以及许多其它类似事物归于耶和华或主是一样的（参看<a href="2447.htm">2447</a>，<a href="6071.htm">6071</a>，<a href="6991.htm">6991</a>，<a href="6997.htm">6997</a>节）。<br />至于那些陷入虚假和由此而来的邪恶，以及陷入邪恶和由此而来的虚假之人的顽固，要知道，这种顽固具有这样的性质，它是无法描述的。他们从不停止，除非他们被严厉的惩罚和由此而来的恐惧吓倒；劝诫和威胁没有任何效果，因为对他们来说，生命的快乐在于作恶，这是他们活在世上时所获得的一种快乐；尤其因为他们只爱自己，不爱他们的邻舍，因而没有任何基督教的仁爱。由于这种人不允许自己被主引导，所以他们出于自己自私的意愿行事，而这意愿就是由于遗传和他们的实际生活所导致的邪恶。出于自己自私的意愿行事就是出于对邪恶的爱作恶，因为凡来自意愿的，皆来自爱。他们作恶的快乐源于这爱，并且这快乐在他们里面掌权到何等程度，顽固在他们里面掌权就到何等程度。<br />这一事实在世上并不明显，因为在世上，他们受自我之爱和尘世之爱约束；害怕他们若公然作恶，就会丧失名声，从而丧失利益和地位。此外，法律和丧命的恐惧也会约束他们。但是，如果这些约束不存在，他们就会急于毁灭凡不偏向他们的人，掠夺所有人的财物，无情地杀害任何人。这就是人内在的样子，也就是他在灵方面的样子，无论他在世上如何表现得不是这样。这一点从来世的人很清楚地看出来，因为那时，外在事物从那些在世时像这样的人身上被夺走，他们只剩下自己的意愿，因而剩下自己的爱。当他们剩下这些东西时，没有什么比作恶更令他们快乐的了。他们还以如此顽固的意志作恶，以致他们从不停止，如前所述，除非他们受到惩罚，然后沉入地狱。由此可以看出一个没有对邻之仁的人是什么样子；还可以看出，每个人的生活在等待着他，这生活不是他作为公民在世上的那种看得见的外在生活，而是他在世上的那种内在的、看不见的属灵生活。</p>

And I will harden his heart, and he will not send away the people. That this signifies obstinacy, and thus not yet liberation, is evident from the signification of "hardening," as being obstinacy, and 
from the signification of the "heart," as being the will (see n. 2930, 3888), thus by these words is signified obstinacy from the will, consequently from the delight of doing evil, because that which 
is of the will is delightful, and this is from the love; and from the signification of "not sending away the people," as being from obstinacy not to be willing to set at liberty, thus not yet liberation. 
It is said here and in what follows that "Jehovah hardened the heart of Pharaoh." This is so said from the appearance, and from the common notion of the Divine as doing all things; but this is to 
be understood in the same way as when evil, anger, fury, devastation, and other like things are attributed to Jehovah or the Lord (see n. 2447, 6071, 6991, 6997). [2] As regards the obstinacy of those 
who are in falsities and the derivative evils, and in evils and the derivative falsities, be it known that the obstinacy is such as cannot be described; for they never desist except through grievous 
punishments and the consequent fears; exhortations and threats are of no avail whatever, because the delight of their life is to do evil. They contracted this delight during their life in the world, 
especially from the fact that they loved themselves only and not the neighbor, thus being in no Christian charity. As people of this kind do not suffer themselves to be led by the Lord, they act from 
their own proper will, which is evil by heredity, and also by actual life; and they who act from their own will, do evil from love; for that which is of the will is of the love; and from this they have 
the delight of doing evil, and so far as they are in this delight, so far they are in obstinacy.  [3] That this is so does not appear in the world, because in the world they are withheld by the love 
of self and the love of the world, for they fear the loss of reputation, and of the consequent gain and honor, if they were to do evil openly. Moreover, the laws and the fear of the loss of life restrain 
them; but if these did not stand in the way, they would rush to destroy all who do not favor them, and would plunder them of all their property, and would mercilessly kill anyone. Such is man 
interiorly, that is, such is man as to his spirit, however much in this world he may appear different. This can be very plainly seen from them in the other life, for then the externals are taken away 
from those who have been such in the world, and they are left to their will, thus to their loves; and when they are left to these, they perceive nothing more delightful than to do evil, which also they 
do with such obstinacy that, as before said, they never desist except through punishments, and afterward by repeated sinkings down into hell. From all this it can be seen what a man is who is in no 
charity toward the neighbor; and also that everyone's life awaits him; not the civil life which was external and apparent in the world, but the spiritual life which was internal and did not appear in 
the world. </p>

'And I will harden his heart, and he will not send the people away' means obstinacy and so a failure to set free as yet. This is clear from the meaning of 'hardening' as obstinacy, and from the meaning 
of 'heart' is that a new perception is meant, as the will, dealt with in <a href="2930.htm">2930</a>, <a href="3888.htm">3888</a>, so that the words used here mean an obstinate determination that springs from the will, and therefore from a delight 
in doing what is evil since what is present in the will is that in which one takes delight, and that in which one takes delight springs from the love one has; and from the meaning of 'not sending 
the people away' as an obstinate unwillingness to set free, thus a failure to set free as yet. It says here and in places further on that Jehovah hardened Pharaoh's heart. Such wording is based on appearances 
and on the general idea about the Divine, that all things are brought about by Him. But this should be understood in exactly the same kind of way as the attribution to Jehovah or the Lord of 
evil, anger, fury, devastation, and many other things like these should be, <a href="2447.htm">2447</a>, <a href="6071.htm">6071</a>, <a href="6991.htm">6991</a>, <a href="6997.htm">6997</a>. </p>
<p></p>
<p><b>[2]</b>
 As regards the obstinacy of those who are steeped in falsities and the resulting evils and in 
evils and the resulting falsities, it should be recognized that the nature of it is such that it defies description. They never leave off, unless they are deterred by harsh punishments and the fears 
these create; exhortations and threats have no effect whatever. The reason for this is that for them the delight of life consists in doing evil, a delight which they acquired while they lived in the 
world, chiefly because they loved solely themselves, not their neighbour, and so did not have any Christian charity. Because people like this do not allow themselves to be led by the Lord, their actions 
are motivated by their own selfish will, which is evil owing to heredity and also to the actual life they lead. And people whose actions are motivated by their own selfish will do what is evil from 
a love of evil, since what comes from the will comes from love. From love springs the delight they feel in doing evil, and in the measure that this delight reigns in them obstinacy reigns in them. </p>

<p><b>[3]</b>
It is not evident in the world that this is so, but that is because in the world they are restrained by self-love and love of the world, for they are afraid they would suffer loss of reputation, 
consequently of monetary gain and of position if they were to do evil openly. Laws and fear for their lives also serve to keep them in check. But if those restraints did not exist they would quickly seek 
to ruin all who are not favourably disposed towards them, plunder everyone's resources, and ruthlessly kill anyone. This is what the person is like inwardly, that is, as to his spirit, though he may 
not seem in the world to be like that, as may be seen perfectly clearly from those who are in the next life. Those who have been like that in the world have external things taken away from them and 
are left to [the desires of] their own will, thus to their own loves; and when they have been left to these nothing gives them greater delight than doing what is evil. They also do it with such obstinate 
determination that they never leave off, unless, as has been stated, they suffer punishments, after which they sink into hell. All this shows what a person is like who has no charity towards the 
neighbour, also that everyone's life awaits him, not his external life as a citizen which could be seen in the world, but his spiritual life, which was internal and unseen in the world.  </p>

`Et Ego obfirmabo cor illius, et non mittet populum': quod significet obstinationem et sic nondum liberationem, constat ex significatione `obfirmare' quod sit obstinatio; et ex significatione `cordis' 
quod sit voluntas, de qua n. 2930, 3888; ita per illa verba significatur obstinatio ex voluntate, proinde ex jucundo {1}faciendi malum, nam quod voluntatis est, hoc {2}jucundum est, et quod jucundum, 
hoc ex amore est; (m)et ex significatione `non mittere populum' quod sit ex {3}obstinato non liberare velle, ita nondum liberatio.(n)  Dicitur hic et in sequentibus quod `Jehovah obfirmaverit cor Pharaonis'; 
ita dicitur ex apparentia et ex communi notione de Divino, quod efficiat omnia, sed hoc intelligendum est, prout quod Jehovae seu Domino tribuatur malum, ira, furor, devastatio, et similia 
plura, n. 2447, (x)6071, 6991, 6997. 	2 Quod obstinationem illorum attinet qui in falsis et male malis ac in malis et inde falsis sunt, sciendum quod obstinatio talis sit ut (t)describi non possit; nusquam 
desistunt, nisi per graves punitiones et inde timores; exhortationes et minae nihil prorsus {4}faciunt; causa est quia jucundum vitae eorum est malum facere; jucundum illud traxerunt dum vixerunt 
in mundo, ex eo imprimis quod se solum amaverint, non proximum, ita quod in nulla charitate Christiana fuerint; illi qui tales sunt, quia non duci se patiuntur a Domino, ex proprio voluntario suo agunt, 
quod voluntarium malum est {5} ex hereditario, {6}et quoque ex actuali vita; et qui ex proprio voluntario agunt, illi ex amore malum agunt, nam quod voluntarii est amoris est; inde illis jucundum 
malum faciendi et quantum in jucundo illo sunt, tantum in obstinatione sunt; quod ita sit, non apparet in mundo, 3 sed hoc ex causa quia in mundo detinet illos amor sui et mundi, nam timent jacturam 
famae, et inde lucri et honoris, si malum aperte facerent; leges quoque et timor vitae arcent; at {7} si non obstarent illa, ruerent in perniciem omnium qui sibi non favent, ac depraedarentur omnium 
facultates, et absque ulla misericordia occiderent quoscumque; talis est homo interius, hoc est, talis est {8}quoad spiritum suum, utcumque in mundo non talis apparet; hoc perquam manifeste constare potest 
ab illis in altera vita: illis qui tales fuerunt in mundo auferuntur externa, et relinquuntur {9} voluntati, ita suis amoribus; et cum iis {10}relicti sunt, nihil jucundius {11}appercipiunt quam 
malum facere; quod etiam faciunt cum tanta obstinatione ut nusquam desistant nisi per punitiones, ut dictum est, et dein per demersiones in infernum.  Ex his constare potest qualis est homo qui in nulla 
charitate erga proximum est; tum quod unumquemvis vita sua maneat, non vita civilis quae fuit externa et apparens in mundo, sed vita spiritualis quae fuit interna, et non in mundo apparuit. 	@1 mali
