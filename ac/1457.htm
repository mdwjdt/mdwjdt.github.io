<h4 align="center"></h4><p><strong>1457.</strong>“后来，亚伯兰又继续踏上旅程”表更进一步。在古人中，旅程、旅行和寄居没有其它含义，因此在圣言中，它们在内义上也没有其它含义。主由此处开始向前发展，进入认知。主也象其他孩子那样接受教导，这一点清楚可见于路加福音：<br />那孩子渐渐长大，灵里强健，住在旷野，直到他显明在以色列人面前的日子。（路加福音<a href="http://39-27.cn/路1.80.htm">1:80</a>）<br />同一福音书：<br />孩子渐渐长大，灵里强健起来，充满智慧，又有神的恩在他身上。（路加福音<a href="http://39-27.cn/路2.40.htm">2:40</a>）<br /><br />过了三天，约瑟和耶稣的母亲就遇见他在殿里，坐在教师中间，一面听，一面问。凡听见他的，都希奇他的聪明和他的应对。他父母看见就很希奇，但耶稣说，为什么找我呢？岂不知我应当以我父的事为念吗？（路加福音<a href="http://39-27.cn/路2.46.htm">2:46</a>，<a href="http://39-27.cn/路2.49.htm">49</a>）<br />那时，祂才十二岁。（路加福音<a href="http://39-27.cn/路2.42.htm">2:42</a>）<br /><br />耶稣的智慧和年纪，并神和人喜爱他的心，都一齐增长。（路加福音<a href="http://39-27.cn/路2.52.htm">2:52</a>）</p><br />

<p><strong>[NCE]1457.</strong> The symbolism of And Abram traveled, going and traveling, as further advancement can be seen from the symbolism of going and traveling. Among the ancients, journeys, travels, and immigration had no other meaning, so in the Word as well they have no other symbolism on an inner level.<br />This is where the Lord's advances into knowledge begin.<br />Like any other person, the Lord also learned by instruction. Luke demonstrates this:<br />The child grew and became strong in spirit. He was in the wastelands up to the day of his presentation to Israel.{*1} (<a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_1457/bible_king-james-version_luke_1_80" target=_top>Luke 1:80</a>)<br />In the same author:<br />The child grew and became strong in spirit and was filled with wisdom; and [God's] favor was on him. (<a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_1457/bible_king-james-version_luke_2_40" target=_top>Luke 2:40</a>)<br />In the same author:<br />Joseph and Jesus' mother, after three days, found him in the Temple, sitting in the middle of the teachers and listening to them and asking them questions; everyone listening to him was astounded at his understanding and his answers. Seeing him, [Joseph and Mary] were amazed, but he said to them, "Why did you search for me? Didn't you know that I have to see to my Father's business?"

(<a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_1457/bible_king-james-version_luke_2_52" target=_top>Luke 2:52</a>)<br /><br /><strong>Footnotes:</strong><br />{*1} The child mentioned in this verse was actually John the Baptist, as the third Latin edition (Swedenborg [1749-1756] 1949-1973) notes; it explains the discrepancy by reference to 搂<a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_1457/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_1927" target=_top>1927</a>, which explicitly states that the verse is about the Lord; and to 搂<a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_1457/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_5620" target=_top>5620</a>, which describes John the Baptist as representing the Lord. Swedenborg expands at length on this representation in 搂<a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_1457/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_9372" target=_top>9372</a>.

A similar interchangeability of symbolism may lie at the root of two other such substitutions: in the first editions a saying of John the Baptist in <a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_1457/bible_king-james-version_luke_3_8-9" target=_top>Luke 3:8-9</a> is ascribed to Jesus in <a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_1457/swedenborg_divine-providence-dole_114" target=_top>Divine Providence 114</a>, and a saying of Jesus in <a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_1457/bible_king-james-version_mark_1_14-15" target=_top>Mark 1:14-15</a> is ascribed to John in <a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_1457/swedenborg_true-christian-religion-chadwick_113#subsection-2-7" target=_top>True Christianity 113:7</a>.

And Abram journeyed, going and journeying. That this signifies further progression, is evident from the signification of "to go," and "to journey." Among the ancients, travels, journeys, and sojournings, 
signified nothing else; hence also in the internal sense they signify nothing else in the Word. Here commence the Lord's advancements into knowledges. That the Lord was also instructed as are other 
men, may be seen in Luke: </p>
<p>     The child* grew and waxed strong in spirit, and was in the deserts till the day of His appearing to Israel (Luke 1:80).      The Child grew and waxed strong in spirit, 
and was filled with wisdom, and grace was upon Him (Luke 2:40).      Joseph and the mother of Jesus after three days found Him in the temple, sitting in the midst of the doctors, both hearing them 
and asking them questions; and all that heard Him were amazed at His understanding and answers. Seeing Him they wondered; but He said unto them, How is it that ye sought Me? Knew ye not that I must 
be in the things that are My Father's? (Luke 2:46-49). That He was then twelve years old, is stated in verse 42, of the same chapter. Again: </p>
<p>     Then Jesus advanced in wisdom and in age, and in grace 
with God and men (Luke 2:52). * This was John the Baptist, the Lord's forerunner. [Reviser.] </p>

That 'Abram travelled, going on and travelling' means further advance becomes clear from the meaning of 'going on and travelling'. Among the ancients, journeys, travels, and sojournings had no other 
meaning, and therefore in the internal sense have no other meaning in the Word. The Lord's advances forward into cognitions begin here. That the Lord also was taught like any other child is made clear 
in Luke, </p>

'Et profectus Abram eundo et proficiscendo':  quod significet progressionem ulteriorem, constare potest a significatione 'ire et proficisci'; apud antiquos itinera, profectiones et peregrinationes nihil 
aliud significabant, inde quoque in sensu interno nihil aliud in Verbo.  Hic incohant progressiones Domini in cognitiones.  Quod Dominus sicut alius homo quoque instructus sit, constare potest apud 
Lucam, {1}'Puerulus crescebat et corroborabatur in spiritu; fuit in desertis ad diem apparitionis Ipsius ad Israelem, i 80: </p>
<p>apud eundem, Puer crescebat et corroborabatur spiritu, et implebatur sapientia, 
et gratia erat super Ipso, ii 40: </p>
<p>apud eundem, Josephus et mater Jesus, post tres dies invenerunt Ipsum in templo, sedentem in medio doctorum, et audientem illos, et interrogantem illos; obstupuerunt 
omnes audientes Ipsum, super intelligentia et responsionibus Ipsius:  videntes Ipsum mirati sunt,... sed dixit ad illos, Quid quod quaesivistis Me?  annon sciebatis, quod in illis, quae Patris 
Mei, oportet Me esse? ii 46-49; </p>
<p>quod fuerit tunc duodecim annorum, ib. (x)ii 42: apud eundem, Deinceps Jesus profecit sapientia et aetate, et gratia apud Deum et homines, ii 52. @1 In the letter 
this applies to John the Baptist, but spiritually he represents the Lord, see n. 1927 and 5620.$ </p>
