<h4 align="center"></h4><p><strong>6994.</strong>出埃及记4:13-17.摩西说，凭我，我主，求求你，你要藉着谁的手，就差派谁去吧！耶和华的怒气向摩西发作，说，不是有你的哥哥利未人亚伦吗？我知道他是能言的，看哪，他正出来迎接你；他一见你，心里就欢喜。你要对他说话，把话放在他的口里；我也要与你的口、他的口同在，又要指教你们所当行的事。他要替你对百姓说话；将来是他要为你当作口，你要为他当作神。你手里要拿这杖，好行神迹。<br />“摩西说，凭我，我主”表明确的断言。“求求你，你要藉着谁的手，就差派谁去吧”表从神性人身发出的神性真理将以间接的方式被说出来。“耶和华的怒气向摩西发作”表宽容。“说，不是有你的哥哥利未人亚伦吗”表良善与真理的教义。“我知道他是能言的”表宣告。“看哪，他正出来迎接你”表接受。“他一见你”表觉知。“心里就欢喜”表爱之情感。“你要对他说话”表流注。“把话放在他的口里”表他所说的话将从神性人身发出。“我也要与你的口同在”表神性真理或神的真理将通过神性人身从神性本身发出。“他的口”表因此，它将与来自那里的事物同在。“又要指教你们所当行的事”表因此，神性将在将要发生的每一件事里面。“他要替你对百姓说话”表他将是呈现给属灵教会的教义。“将来是他要为你当作口”表也间接从主发出的教义真理。“你要为他当作神”表直接从主发出的神性真理。“你手里要拿这杖”表其中的神性能力，即在这两种真理里面的神性能力。“好行神迹”表随后的启示和对真理的确证。</p>

Verses 13-17. And he said, In me, my Lord, send I pray by the hand of him whom Thou wilt send. And the anger of Jehovah was kindled against Moses, and He said, Is there not Aaron, thy brother, the Levite? 
I know that speaking he will speak. And also behold he goeth forth to meet thee; and he will see thee, and he will be glad in his heart. And thou shalt speak unto him, and shalt put the words in 
his mouth; and I will be with thy mouth, and with his mouth, and will teach you what ye shall do. And he shall speak for thee unto the people; and it shall be that he shall be to thee for a mouth, and 
thou shalt be to him for God. And thou shalt take in thy hand this rod, wherewith thou shalt do the signs. "And he said, In me, my Lord," signifies asseveration; "send I pray by the hand of him whom 
Thou wilt send," signifies that the Divine truth proceeding from the Divine Human will be mediately uttered; "and the anger of Jehovah was kindled against Moses," signifies clemency; "and He said, Is 
there not Aaron thy brother the Levite?" signifies the doctrine of good and truth; "I know that he will speak," signifies preaching; "and also behold he goeth forth to meet thee," signifies reception; 
"and he will see thee," signifies perception; "and he will be glad in his heart," signifies the affection of love; "and thou shalt speak unto him," signifies influx; "and shalt put the words in his 
mouth," signifies that what he utters will proceed from the Divine Human; "and I will be with thy mouth," signifies that truth Divine will proceed through the Divine Human from the Divine Itself; "and 
with his mouth," signifies thus with the things thence derived; "and will teach you what ye shall do," signifies thus the Divine in each and all things which shall be done; "and he shall speak for thee 
unto the people," signifies that he will be doctrine to the spiritual church; "and it shall be that he shall be to thee for a mouth," signifies truth Divine, which also proceeds mediately from the 
Lord; "and thou shalt be to him for God," signifies the Divine truth which proceeds immediately from the Lord; "and thou shalt take in thy hand this rod," signifies Divine power therein; "wherewith thou 
shalt do the signs," signifies the consequent enlightenment and confirmation of truths. </p>

Verses 13-17 And he said, By me,<A name="fntext1"></a><A href="#fn1"><sup>a</sup></a> Lord, send, I beg You, through the hand [of another] You may send. And the anger of Jehovah was kindled against Moses, and He said, Is there not Aaron your brother, 
the Levite? I know that he will speak ably. And also, behold, he is coming out to meet you; and he will see you and be glad in his heart. And you are to speak to him, and to put words in his mouth; and 
I will be with your mouth and with his mouth, and will teach you the things you will do. And he will speak for you to the people; and it will happen, that he will be for you as a mouth, and you will 
be for him as a god. And you are to take this rod in your hand, with which you shall do the signs.  </p>
<p>'And he said, By me, Lord' means a categorical assertion. 'Send, I beg You, through the hand [of 
another] You may send' means that Divine Truth going forth from the Divine Human will be uttered in an indirect way. 'And the anger of Jehovah was kindled against Moses' means leniency. 'And He said, 
Is there not Aaron your brother, the Levite?' means teachings that present what is good and true. 'I know that he will speak' means declaration. 'And also, behold, he is coming out to meet you' means 
reception. 'And he will see you' means perception. 'And be glad in his heart' means an affection belonging to love. 'And you are to speak to him' means influx. 'And to put words in his mouth' means that 
the things he utters will go forth from the Divine Human. 'And I will be with your mouth' means that God's truth will go forth from the Divine itself by way of the Divine Human. 'And with his mouth' 
means that it will therefore be with the things that come from there. 'And will teach you the things you will do' means that the Divine will therefore be within every single thing that is going to 
happen. 'And he will speak for you to the people' means that he will be the teaching presented to the spiritual Church. 'And it will happen, that he will be for you as a mouth' means the truth contained 
in doctrinal teachings, which also goes forth from the Lord in an indirect way. 'And you will be for him as a god' means Divine Truth that goes forth directly from the Lord. 'And you are to take this 
rod in your hand' means Divine power in these [two kinds of truth]. 'With which you shall do the signs' means consequent enlightenment and corroboration of truths.

{1}  Vers. 13-17.  Et dixit, In me, Domine, mitte quaeso, per manum mittas.  Et accensa ira Jehovae in Moschen, et dixit, Annon Aharon frater tuus Levita? novi quod loquendo loquetur ille; et etiam ecce 
ille exit obviam tibi, et videbit te, et laetabitur in corde suo.  Et loquaris ad illum, et ponas verba in ore illius, et Ego ero cum ore tuo, et cum ore ejus, et docebo vos quae facietis.  Et loquetur 
ille tibi ad populum, et fiet, ille erit tibi ad os, et tu eris illi ad deum.  Et baculum hunc accipias in manu tua, quo facies signa.  `Et dixit, In me, Domine' significat asseverationem: `mitte 
quaeso, per manum mittas' significat quod Divinum Verum a Divino Humano {2}procedens mediate enuntiabitur:  `et accensa ira Jehovae in Moschen' significat clementiam: `et dixit, Annon Aharon frater tuus 
Levita?' significat doctrinam boni et veri: `novi quod loquetur ille' significat praedicationem: `et etiam ecce ille exit obviam tibi' significat receptionem: `et videbit te' significat perceptionem: 
`et laetabitur in corde suo' significat affectionem amoris: `et loquaris ad illum' significat influxum: `et ponas verba in ore illius' significat quod quae enuntiat a Divino Humano procedent: `et 
Ego ero cum ore tuo' significat quod verum Divinum procedet per Divinum Humanum ab Ipso Divino: `et cum ore ejus' significat ita cum illis quae inde: `et docebo vos quae facietis' significat ita Divinum 
in omnibus et singulis quae fient: `et loquetur ille tibi ad populum' significat quod ille doctrina erit Ecclesiae spirituali: `et fiet, ille erit tibi ad os' significat verum {3}doctrinae quod etiam 
mediate a Domino procedit: `et tu eris illi ad deum' significat Divinum Verum quod immediate a Domino procedit: `et baculum hunc accipias in manu tua' significat potentiam Divinam in illis: `quo facies 
signa' significat inde illustrationem et confirmationem veritatum. 	@1 In A this   is found in Vol. iii, p. 121.$ 	@2 procedet, sed mediate$ 	@3 Divinum I$ </p>
