<h3 align="center" class="ired">属天的奥秘 第7090节</h3>
<h4 align="center"></h4><p><strong>7090.</strong>“对法老说”表（来自它们）对那些反对教会真理之人的告诫。这从“说”的含义和“法老”的代表清楚可知：“说”因通过摩西和亚伦来自神性的命令，故是指告诫（参看<a href="7033.htm">7033</a>节）；“法老”是指反对教会真理的记忆知识（<a href="6651.htm">6651</a>，<a href="6673.htm">6673</a>，<a href="6683.htm">6683</a>节），因而是指反对它们的人。此处和下文论述的主题是那些属于属灵教会的人通过主的降世而得救，在主降临之前滞留在低地，在那里被虚假，也就是那些陷入源于邪恶的虚假之人侵扰。低地位于脚底之下，被地狱包围；那些歪曲真理、玷污良善的人在它前面；那些破坏神性秩序，从而企图获得权柄的人在右边；出于爱自己而密谋反对邻舍的邪恶恶魔在后面；而那些完全鄙弃神性，敬拜自然，将一切属灵之物都从自己身上逐出的人则在下面的深处。这就是包围那些在低地之人的地狱，在主降临之前，属于属灵教会的人就安全地留守在那里。尽管他们在那里受到侵扰，但主保护他们；当主复活时，他们就被带上天堂。关于这些人，可参看前面的阐述和说明（<a href="6854.htm">6854</a>，<a href="6855.htm">6855</a>，<a href="6914.htm">6914</a>，<a href="6945.htm">6945</a>，<a href="7035.htm">7035</a>节）。<br />在圣言中，经上多次提及那些属于属灵教会的人安全留守，直到主降临的低地，如以赛亚书：<br />诸天哪，应当歌唱！因为耶和华做成这事。地的低层部分啊，应当欢呼！众山哪，应当发声歌唱，森林和其中所有的树都当如此。因为耶和华救赎了雅各，并要因以色列使自己得荣耀。（以赛亚书<a href="http://39-27.cn/赛44.23.htm">44:23</a>）<br />这论及那些在低地的人，即：他们被主拯救；“雅各”和“以色列”是指属灵教会，“雅各”是指外在教会，“以色列”是指内在教会（参看<a href="3305.htm">3305</a>，<a href="4286.htm">4286</a>，<a href="6426.htm">6426</a>节）。以西结书：<br />那时，我要叫你跟那些下阴坑的人一起下到古时的人那里，使你不再住在低级事物之地，在已荒凉之地。（以西结书<a href="http://39-27.cn/结26.20.htm">26:20</a>）<br /><br />到低级事物之地，世人中间和下坑的人那里；伊甸的一切树，就是黎巴嫩得水滋润最佳最美的树，都在低地受了安慰。（以西结书<a href="http://39-27.cn/结31.14.htm">31:14</a>，<a href="http://39-27.cn/结31.16.htm">16</a>）<br />此处“低地”是指那些属于属灵教会的人所在的地方。<br />如今，那些属于教会，头脑充满世俗和尘世观念，并使得信之真理与这类观念相联结的人也被下入低地，在那里同样陷入争战。这些争战一直持续到他们的世俗和尘世观念与信之真理分离，其它无法再相联结的观点被植入为止。一旦这一过程结束，这些人就从那里被提入天堂；事实上，在他们的这类观念被除去之前，他们不可能与天使在一起，因为这些世俗和尘世观念充满黑暗和污秽，与天堂的光明和纯洁不一致。这些世俗和尘世观念若不通过与虚假争战，就无法被分离并除去。这些争战以下面的方式进行：那些在低地的人被周围的地狱居民所发出的幻觉和基于幻觉的虚假所侵扰；但主利用天堂来驳斥这些幻觉和虚假，同时引入真理。这些真理看似在那些经历争战的人里面。<br />正因如此，属灵教会被称为“战斗教会”（militant Church）。但如今，战斗教会很少在世人那里；因为当教会成员活在世上时，他由于聚集在他周围的恶人，以及他所住肉体的软弱而无法承受争战。在来世，一个人可以牢固地被保持在良心的约束中，但在世上却不行；因为如果他在世上受到一点绝望，如那些经历争战的人通常所遭受的那样，他立刻就会冲破这些约束。他若冲突这些约束，就会屈服；若屈服，就他的救恩而言，他就完了。这解释了为何如今主只允许教会中极少数人为真理而与虚假争战。这些争战是属灵的试探。关于低地和那里的消磨，也可参看前面的说明（<a href="4728.htm">4728</a>，<a href="4940.htm">4940</a>-<a href="4951.htm">4951</a>，<a href="6854.htm">6854</a>节）。</p>

And they said unto Pharaoh. That this signifies exhortation to those who are against the truths of the church, is evident from the signification of "saying," because it was by Moses and Aaron from Divine 
command, as being exhortation (see n. 7033); and from the representation of Pharaoh, as being memory-knowledge that is against the truths of the church (n. 6651, 6673, 6683), thus those who are of 
such a character. Here and in what follows are treated of those of the spiritual church who were saved by the coming of the Lord into the world, and who before His coming were detained in the lower 
earth, and there agitated by falsities, that is, by the infernals who are in falsities from evil. That earth is beneath the soles of the feet, surrounded by the hells; in front by those who have falsified 
truths and adulterated goods; on the right by those who pervert Divine order, and from this study to acquire to themselves power; at the back by evil genii, who from the love of self have secretly 
plotted evil against the neighbor; deep under these are they who have utterly spurned the Divine, and have worshiped nature, and consequently have put away from them everything spiritual. With such 
are they surrounded who are in the lower earth, where before the coming of the Lord they who were of the spiritual church were reserved, and were there infested; nevertheless they were protected by the 
Lord, and were carried up into heaven with the Lord when He rose again (about this see what has been said and shown above, n. 6854, 6855, 6914, 6945, 7035). [2] The lower earth, where were reserved 
those who were of the spiritual church till the Lord's coming, is sometimes mentioned in the Word, as in Isaiah: </p>
<p>     Sing, ye heavens, for Jehovah hath done it; shout ye lower parts of the earth; resound 
with singing, ye mountains, O forest, and every tree therein; because Jehovah hath redeemed Jacob, and hath rendered Himself glorious in Israel (Isa. 44:23); </p>
<p>speaking of those who are in the lower 
earth, that they were saved by the Lord; "Jacob" and "Israel" are the spiritual church, "Jacob" the external church, "Israel" the internal (see n. 3305, 4286, 6426). In Ezekiel: </p>
<p>     I will make 
thee come down with them that descend into the pit, to the people of eternity, and I will make thee dwell in the earth of lower things, in the desolations (Ezek. 26:20). Again: </p>
<p>     To the earth of 
lower things, in the midst of the sons of man, to them that go down to the pit; whence all the trees of Eden shall be comforted in the lower earth, the choice and the chief of Lebanon, all that drink 
water (Ezek. 31:14, 16); </p>
<p>here the "lower earth" is where were those who had been of the spiritual church. [3] At this day also, they who are of the church and have filled their ideas with worldly and 
also with earthly things, and have caused the truths of faith to be joined to such things, are let down to the lower earth, and are also in combats there; and this until these worldly and earthly things 
have been separated from the truths of faith, and such things have been implanted as will prevent their being further joined together. When this is over, they are lifted up from thence into heaven; 
for until such things have been removed, they cannot possibly be with the angels, because these worldly and earthly things are darkness and defilements, which do not accord with the light and purity 
of heaven. These worldly and earthly things cannot be separated and removed except by means of combats against falsities. These combats take place in this way: they who are in the lower earth are infested 
by the fallacies and derivative falsities which are sent forth from the infernals round about, but are refuted by the Lord through heaven; and at the same time truths are instilled, and these 
truths appear as if they were in those who are in the combats.  [4] Hence it is that the spiritual church is to be called "militant." But at this day it is rarely a militant church with anyone in the 
world, for while the man of the church lives in the world he cannot endure combat, because of the crowd of evil ones in the midst of whom he is; and because of the flesh in which he is, which is weak. 
In the other life a man can be kept firmly in the bonds of conscience, but not so in the world; for if in the world he is brought into anything of despair, as those are wont to be who are in combats, 
he forthwith bursts these bonds; and if he bursts them, he then yields; and if he so yields, it is all over with his salvation. Hence it is that few within the church at this day are admitted by the 
Lord into combats for truths against falsities. These combats are spiritual temptations. (See also what has been before shown concerning the lower earth and vastations there, n. 4728, 4940-4951, 6854.) </p>

'And said to Pharaoh' means an admonition [from them] to those who are opposed to the Church's truths. This is clear from the meaning of 'saying' - since it came by Divine command from Moses and Aaron 
- as an admonition, as also in <a href="7033.htm">7033</a>; and from the representation of 'Pharaoh' as factual knowledge that is opposed to the Church's truths, dealt with in <a href="6651.htm">6651</a>, <a href="6673.htm">6673</a>, <a href="6683.htm">6683</a>, thus people who are opposed 
to them. Here and in what follows the subject is those belonging to the spiritual Church who were saved through the Lord's Coming into the world but who before His Coming had been held back on the lower 
earth, where they were harassed by falsities, that is, by those from hell steeped in falsities stemming from evil. That lower earth is situated below the soles of the feet and is surrounded by hells 
- in front of it those who have falsified truths and adulterated forms of good; to the right those who pervert Divine order and thereby strive to obtain power; to the rear the evil genii who, motivated 
by self-love, have secretly devised evil against their neighbour; and deep down underneath those who have rejected the Divine with utter contempt and worshipped nature, and in so doing have banished 
from themselves everything spiritual. Such are the hells surrounding those on the lower earth, where before the Lord's Coming people belonging to the spiritual Church were held in safe keeping. Though 
they were molested there the Lord protected them, and they were brought into heaven with the Lord when He rose again. See what has been stated and shown already regarding these people in <a href="6854.htm">6854</a>, <a href="6865.htm">6865</a>, <a href="6914.htm">6914</a>, <a href="6945.htm">6945</a>, <a href="7035.htm">7035</a>. </p>
<p></p>
<p><b>[2]</b>
 The lower earth where those who belonged to the spiritual Church were held in safe keeping up to the Lord's Coming is mentioned a number of times in the Word, as in Isaiah, </p>
<blockquote>
Sing, 
O heavens, for Jehovah has done [it]! Shout, you lower parts of the earth! Be filled, O mountains, with singing, O forest and every tree in it! For Jehovah has redeemed Jacob, and made Himself 
glorious in Israel. <a href="http://bible.gospelcom.net/cgi-bin/bible?passage=Isa%2044:23&amp;version=ESV&amp;interface=print&amp;showfn=yes&amp;showxref">Isa 44:23</a>. 
</blockquote>
<p>This refers to those on the lower earth, to the fact that they were saved by the Lord. 'Jacob' and 'Israel' are the spiritual Church, 'Jacob' being the external 
Church, 'Israel' the internal Church, <a href="3305.htm">3305</a>, <a href="4286.htm">4286</a>, <a href="6426.htm">6426</a>. In Ezekiel, </p>
<blockquote>
I will cause you to go down with those going down to the pit, to the people of old,<A name="fntext1"></a><A href="#fn1"><sup>a</sup></a> and I will cause you to dwell in the land of 
the lower ones in desolations. <a href="http://bible.gospelcom.net/cgi-bin/bible?passage=Ezek%2016:20&amp;version=ESV&amp;interface=print&amp;showfn=yes&amp;showxref">Ezek 16:20</a>. 
</blockquote>
<p>In the same prophet, </p>
<blockquote>
. . . to the lower earth in the midst of the sons of men, to those going down to the pit. Consequently all the trees of Eden, the 
choicest and the most excellent of Lebanon, all those drinking water, will comfort themselves on the lower earth. <a href="http://bible.gospelcom.net/cgi-bin/bible?passage=Ezek%2031:14,%2016&amp;version=ESV&amp;interface=print&amp;showfn=yes&amp;showxref">Ezek 31:14, 16</a>. 
</blockquote>
<p>This refers to the lower earth where those who belonged to the spiritual 
Church were. </p>
<p></p>
<p><b>[3]</b>
 At the present day too those belonging to the Church who have filled their minds with worldly and also earthly ideas and have acted in such a way that the truths of faith 
have become tied up with them are sent down to the lower earth, where they likewise have battles to fight. These battles continue until their worldly and earthly ideas have been separated from the truths 
of faith and other notions have been introduced, of such a nature that they cannot be linked together any longer. Once this has been accomplished those people are raised from there into heaven; for 
until such ideas of theirs have been removed they cannot possibly be in the company of angels, since those ideas are full of darkness and defilement that do not accord with the light and purity of heaven. 
Those worldly and earthly ideas cannot be separated and removed except by means of battles against falsities, battles which take place in the following manner: Those on that lower earth are molested 
by illusions and by falsities based on them which emanate from inhabitants of the surrounding hells; but the Lord employs heaven to rebut those illusions and falsities and at the same time to introduce 
truths. These truths seem to reside with those undergoing the conflicts. </p>
<p></p>
<p><b>[4]</b>
 All this being so, the spiritual Church ought to be spoken of as a militant Church. But at the present day it is 
rarely militant with anyone in the world; for while a member of the Church is living in the world he does not experience conflict, because of the wicked crowded around him and because of the weakness 
of the flesh in which he lives. In the next life a person may be held firmly by the bonds of conscience, but not so in the world, for if in the world he is subjected to any degree of despair, as normally 
happens to those undergoing conflicts, he instantly breaks those bonds. And if he breaks them he gives in; and if he gives in he is done for so far as his salvation is concerned. This explains why 
the Lord allows few within the Church at the present day to enter into battles against falsities on behalf of truths; those battles are spiritual temptations. See also what has been shown already regarding 
the lower earth and vastations that take place there, in <a href="4728.htm">4728</a>, <a href="4940.htm">4940</a>-<a href="4951.htm">4951</a>, <a href="6854.htm">6854</a>.

`Et dixerunt ad Pharaonem': quod significet [inde] exhortationem ad illos qui contra vera Ecclesiae, constat ex significatione `dicere,' quia a Mosche et Aharone ex mandato Divino, quod sit exhortatio, 
ut quoque n. 7033; et ex repraesentatione `Pharaonis' quod sit scientificum quod contra vera Ecclesiae, de qua n. 6651, (x)6673, 6683, ita illi qui tales sunt. Hic et in sequentibus agitur de illis 
qui ab Ecclesia spirituali salvati sunt per Adventum Domini in mundum, quique ante Adventum Ipsius detenti fuerunt in terra inferiore et ibi vexati a falsis, hoc est, ab infernalibus qui in falsis ex 
malo sunt; terra illa est sub plantis circumcincta infernis, a parte anteriore illis qui falsificarunt vera et adulterarunt bona; ad dextrum illis qui pervertunt ordinem Divinum, et inde sibi potentiam 
acquirere student; a tergo {1}malis geniis qui ex amore sui occulte machinati sunt malum contra proximum; profunde infra illos sunt qui Divinum prorsus spreverunt et naturam coluerunt, et inde omne 
spirituale a se removerunt; talibus circumcincti sunt illi qui in terra inferiore sunt, ubi ante Adventum Domini reservati sunt illi qui ab Ecclesia spirituali ac ibi infestati; sed usque a {2}Domino 
tutati, et evecti in caelum cum Domino quando Ipse resurrexit; de his videantur quae prius n. 6854, (x)6865, 6914, 6945, 7035, dicta et ostensa sunt. 	2 (s)Terra inferior, ubi reservati sunt illi qui 
ab Ecclesia spirituali {3} ad Adventum Domini, in Verbo aliquoties nominatur, ut apud Esaiam, Cantate caeli, quia fecit Jehovah, jubilate inferiora terrae, personate montes cantu, silva et omnis arbor 
in illa, quia redemit Jehovah Jacobum, et in Israele gloriosum se reddidit, xliv 23; </p>
<p>ibi de illis qui in inferiore terra, quod salvati a Domino; `Jacob' et `Israel' {4}sunt Ecclesia spiritualis, 
`Jacob' {5}Ecclesia externa, `Israel' {6} interna, n. 3305, 4286, 6426: apud Ezechielem, Fecero descendere te cum descendentibus foveam, ad populum aeternitatis, et habitare fecero te in terra inferiorum 
in desolationibus, xxvi 20: </p>
<p>apud eundem, Ad terram {7}inferiorem in medio filiorum hominis, ad descendentes foveam: unde consolabuntur se in terra inferiore omnes arbores Edenis, selectio et praecipuum 
Libani, omnes bibentes aquas, xxxi 14, 16; </p>
<p>ibi terra inferior, ubi illi qui {8} ab Ecclesia spirituali {9}fuerunt. 	3 Hodie etiam, qui ab Ecclesia sunt, et impleverunt ideas suas mundanis 
et quoque terrestribus, et fecerunt ut vera fidei talibus {10} adjuncta essent, illi {11} ad terram inferiorem demittuntur et ibi quoque in pugnis sunt, et hoc usque dum mundana et terrestria illi a veris 
fidei separata sunt, ac talia inserta ut non amplius conjungantur; cum hoc peractum est, tunc inde elevantur in caelum nam antequam talia amota sunt, nullatenus possunt cum angelis esse sunt enim 
illa tenebrae et inquinamenta quae cum luce et puritate caeli non concordant; mundana et terrestria illa non nisi quam per pugnas contra falsa separari et amoveri possunt; pugnae illae fiunt hoc modo: 
infestantur illi qui ibi, a fallaciis et inde falsis quae ab infernalibus circumcirca emittuntur, sed a Domino per caelum refelluntur, et simul tunc insinuantur vera; et {12}haec apparent sicut 4 apud 
illos qui in pugnis sunt; inde est quod Ecclesia spiritualis dicenda sit {13} pugnans; sed {14}hodie raro est pugnans apud aliquem in mundo, nam {15}homo Ecclesiae cum vivit in mundo, non sustinet 
pugnam, propter malorum turbam in cujus medio est, et propter carnem in qua est, quae infirma; homo in altera vita {16} contineri potest firmiter in vinculis conscientiae, non autem ita in mundo, nam 
si in mundo perducitur in aliquid desperationis, ut solent illi qui in pugnis {17} sunt, ilico vincula illa rumpit; sique illa rumpit, tunc succumbit, et si ita succumbit, actum est de salute ejus; inde 
est quod pauci intra Ecclesiam hodie a Domino admittuntur in pugnas pro veris contra falsa; pugnae illae sunt tentationes spirituales.  Videantur etiam quae de terra inferiore, et vastationibus ibi,
