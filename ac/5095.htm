<h3 align="center" class="ired">属天的奥秘 第5095节</h3>
<h4 align="center"></h4><p><strong>5095.</strong>“埃及王的”表受内层属世层支配的。这从法老或“埃及王”的含义清楚可知，在本章，法老或“埃及王”是指属世层的一个新状态（<a href="5079.htm">5079</a>，<a href="5080.htm">5080</a>节），因而是指内层属世层，因为该层已变新。至于何为内层属世层，何为外层属世层，可参看前文（<a href="5094.htm">5094</a>节）。必须简要阐述圣言的内义，无论历史部分的，还是预言部分的，是何性质。当历史意义提及许多人物时，如此处的约瑟、法老、护卫长、酒政和膳长，其实他们在内义上表示各种事物；但这一切只存在于一个人里面。原因在于，名字表示不同的属灵事物，如此处“约瑟”代表来自理性层，也在属世层里面的属天-属灵层方面的主；“法老”代表属世人的新状态，也就是内层属世层方面的主；“酒政和膳长”代表那些属于外层属世层的事物方面的主。这就是内义的性质；其它地方也一样，如提及亚伯拉罕、以撒和雅各的地方。就字义而言，他们是三个不同的人；但就至高意义而言，这三人代表主：“亚伯拉罕”代表神性本身，“以撒”代表祂的神性理性层；“雅各”代表祂的神性属世层。这种情形可见于先知书，有时先知书的经文只有名字，要么是人名，要么是国名，要么是城名；然而，就内义而言，这些名字一起表现并描述一个实体或事物。人若意识不到这一点，可能很容易被字义误导去思想各种各样的事物；结果，一个实体或事物的观念就消散了。</p>

Of the king of Egypt. That this signifies which were subordinate to the interior natural, is evident from the representation of Pharaoh or the king of Egypt in this chapter, as being a new state of the 
natural (n. 5079, 5080), consequently the interior natural, for this was made new. What the interior natural is, and what the exterior, may be seen just above (n. 5094). What is the nature of the internal 
sense in the historic and prophetic portions of the Word, must be briefly told. Where several persons are mentioned in the historic sense-as here Joseph, Pharaoh, the prince of the guards, the 
butler and the baker-in the internal sense they indeed signify various things; but only in one person. The reason is that names signify things, as for instance Joseph here represents the Lord as to the 
celestial spiritual from the rational and also in the natural, Pharaoh represents Him as to the new state of the natural or as to the interior natural, the butler and the baker represent Him as to 
those things which are of the exterior natural. Such is the internal sense; and it is the same in other places, as where Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob are mentioned. In the sense of the letter these are three 
persons, but in the supreme sense all three represent the Lord-Abraham the Divine Itself, Isaac the Divine intellectual, and Jacob His Divine natural. It is the same in the prophets, where sometimes 
the narration consists of mere names, such as those of persons, kingdoms, or cities, and yet in the internal sense these names together present and describe one thing. One who is not aware of this 
may easily be led away by the sense of the letter into thinking of a variety of things, and thus the idea of one thing is dissipated. </p>

'To the king of Egypt' means which were subordinate to the interior natural. This is clear from the representation of Pharaoh or 'the king of Egypt' in this chapter as a new state of the natural man, 
dealt with in <a href="5079.htm">5079</a>, <a href="5080.htm">5080</a>, consequently as the interior natural since this had been made new. As to what the interior natural is, and the exterior natural, see immediately above in <a href="5094.htm">5094</a>. The nature of 
the internal sense of the Word in the historical sections and in the prophetical parts must be stated briefly. When the historical sense mentions a number of persons - as when Joseph, Pharaoh, the chief 
of the attendants, the cupbearer, and the baker are mentioned here - various things are indeed meant by them in the internal sense, yet only as all these exist in one person. The reason for this is 
that names mean different spiritual things, as they do here: 'Joseph' represents the Lord as regards the celestial-spiritual from the rational and also within the natural, 'Pharaoh' represents Him as 
regards the new state of the natural man, that is, as regards the interior natural, 'the cupbearer and the baker' as regards the things that belong to the external natural. Such is the nature of the 
internal sense. The same is so in other places, for example when Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob are mentioned; in the sense of the letter they are three different persons, but in the highest sense all three 
represent the Lord - 'Abraham' the Divine itself, 'Isaac' His Divine Intellectual,<A name="fntext1"></a><A href="#fn1"><sup>a</sup></a> and 'Jacob' His Divine Natural. The same may be seen in the Prophets where sometimes the text consists of mere names, 
either of persons or of kingdoms or of cities; yet all of them together present and describe a single entity in the internal sense. Anyone unaware of this may be easily misled by the sense of the 
letter into visualizing a variety of things, with the result that the idea of a single entity disappears.

</p><b>5095.</b>
`Qui regi Aegypti':  quod significet quae subordinata interiori naturali, constat ex repraesentatione Pharaonis seu `regis Aegypti' in hoc capite quod sit status naturalis novus, de qua n. 5079, 
5080, consequenter interius naturale, nam hoc novum factum; quid interius naturale, et exterius, mox supra n. 5094 videatur.  Qualis sensus Verbi internus in historicis et in propheticis{1} est, paucis 
dicendum: ubi in sensu historico memorantur plures personae, sicut hic Josephus, Pharaoh, princeps satellitum, pincerna, pistor, in sensu interno quidem significant varia, sed solum in una persona; 
causa est quia `nomina' significant res; sicut hic `Josephus' repraesentat Dominum quoad caeleste spirituale e rationali et quoque in naturali, `Pharaoh' Ipsum quoad statum naturalis novum, seu 
quoad interius naturale, `pincerna et pistor' quoad illa quae sunt externi naturalis; talis est sensus internus; similiter alibi, ut ubi nominantur Abrahamus, Jishakus et Jacobus, in sensu litterae 
sunt tres personae, at in sensu supremo omnes tres Dominum repraesentant, nempe `Abrahamus' Ipsum Divinum, `Jishakus' Divinum Intellectuale, et `Jacobus' Divinum Naturale Ipsius; etiam apud Prophetas 
ubi quandoque locutio fit per mera nomina, sive personarum, sive regnorum, sive urbium, et usque simul unam rem sistunt et describunt in sensu interno; qui hoc non novit, facile potest a sensu 
litterae auferri in varia, et sic dissipari idea rei unius. </p>
