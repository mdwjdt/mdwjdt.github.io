<h4 align="center"></h4><p><strong>8750.</strong>“第三个月”表状态的完满。这从“月”、“三”和“第三”的含义清楚可知：“月”是指状态，因为所有时间段，如天、周、月、年，都表示状态（参看<a href="2788.htm">2788</a>节）；“三”和“第三”是指完整之物（<a href="1825.htm">1825</a>，<a href="2788.htm">2788</a>，<a href="4495.htm">4495</a>，<a href="5159.htm">5159</a>节），因此，“第三个月”表示处于完满的状态。<br />必须简要提一下何为状态的完满。每个状态都它的开始、发展和结束。一种状态到了结束的时候，就是完满或完整的，并被称为“完满”。在来世，一切事物都是以其状态所经历的发展阶段，以及这些事物从开始到结束的连续变化来衡量的，就像它们在世上以时间段来衡量一样。这是因为天堂里没有时间，取而代之的是状态。原因在于，在来世，太阳，也就是主，始终保持在本位，不像世上那样每天都有明显的进展，将一天分为早晨、正午、晚上和夜间；也不像世上那样每年都有明显的进展，将一年分为春、夏、秋、冬。正因如此，天堂里没有时间，取而代之的是状态。然而，由于天堂的至内在气场里面有一种照着神性的天堂形式而发生的进展或发展，并且这种进展或发展无人能察觉，还由于天堂里所有人的状态都照这种发展的过程而发生变化，所以那里的天使会经历状态的循环；在这种循环中，爱之良善、信之真理，或在这二者方面的模糊占主导地位。由此产生了天堂状态与世上各时间段的对应关系，也就是说，爱之良善的状态与早晨，信之真理的状态与正午，模糊状态与晚上并夜间的对应关系。此外，天堂太阳散发的热，也是爱之良善，天堂太阳发出的光是信之真理。由此也产生了世上的热与爱的对应关系，因此，这热被称为属灵之热；还产生了世上的光与信的对应关系，因此，这光被称为属灵之光。<br />一般来说，生命有两种状态，即思维的状态，就是属于理解力的一种状态，情感的状态，就是属于意愿的一种状态。属于理解力的思维状态与信之真理有关。这种状态就是被天堂的太阳，也就是主发出的光启示或光照的状态。这光也是人里面理解力之光的源头。但属于意愿的情感状态与仁之良善有关；此外，天堂太阳，也就是主散发的热，是人里面的意愿之热，也就是爱的源头。由此可见在来世状态及其变化是怎么回事，以及何谓“第三个月”所表示的状态的完满。此处完满所论及的状态是指那些属于属灵教会的人已经历的第一种或前一种状态；因为这些人经历了两种状态，第一种是在他们被主通过真理引导之时，第二种是在他们被主通过良善引导之时（参看<a href="8643.htm">8643</a>，<a href="8648.htm">8648</a>，<a href="8658.htm">8658</a>，<a href="8685.htm">8685</a>，<a href="8690.htm">8690</a>，<a href="8701.htm">8701</a>节）。此处指的是第一种或前一种状态的完满，就是前面早已描述过的状态；现在描述的是第二种状态。</p>

In the third month. That this signifies fullness of state, is evident from the signification of "month," as being state; for all periods of time, as "days," "weeks," "months," and "years," signify states 
(see n. 2788); and from the signification of "three" and "third," as being what is complete (n. 1825, 2788, 4495, 5159); consequently "in the third month" denotes in fullness of state. [2] What 
fullness of state is, shall be briefly told. Every state has its beginning, its progression, and its end. When a state arrives at its end, it is then full, and is called "fullness." In the other life 
all things are measured by progressions of state and their successive changes from beginning to end, as in the world by times. That this is so is because in heaven there are no times, but states in their 
stead. The reason is that the sun in the other life, which is the Lord, remains constantly in its place, and does not, as in the world, by apparent daily progressions distinguish the day into morning, 
noon, evening, and night; nor by apparent annual progressions distinguish the year into spring, summer, autumn, and winter. From this it is that in heaven there are no times, but states in their 
stead. But as in the inmost sphere of heaven there is a certain progression according to the Divine heavenly form, which comes to the perception of no one, and as according to this progression the states 
of all in heaven undergo changes, the angels there are by turns in the good of love, in the truth of faith, and in obscurity as to the one and the other. From this it is that there is a correspondence 
of the states there with times in the world, namely, of the state of the good of love with morning, of the state of the truth of faith with good, and of an obscure state with evening and night. Moreover 
the heat also, which is from the sun there, is the good of love; and the light which is from the sun there, is the truth of faith. From this also it is that there is a correspondence of the heat 
in the world with love, which is therefore called "spiritual heat;" as also of the light in the world with faith, which is therefore called "spiritual light." [3] There are in general two states of 
life, namely, a state of thought, which is of the understanding, and a state of affection, which is of the will. The state of thought, which is of the understanding, bears relation to the truth which 
is of faith. It is this state that is enlightened by light from the sun of heaven, which is the Lord. So also is the light of the understanding in man from that light. But the state of affection, which 
is of the will, bears relation to the good which is of charity; and moreover the heat of the will in man, which is love, is from the heat from that sun in heaven, which is the Lord. From all this 
it can now be seen how the case is with states and their changes in the other life, and what is meant by the fullness of state which is signified by "the third month." By state here, of which fullness 
is predicated, is meant the former state which those who were of the spiritual church had passed through. (That these pass through two states, the first when they are led by the Lord by means of truth, 
the second when they are led by Him by means of good, see n. 8643, 8648, 8658, 8685, 8690, 8701.) Here there is meant a fullness of the former state which has been described in what goes before; now 
the second state is described. </p>

<p align="center"><b>Elliott(1983-1999) 8750</b></p><p><b>8750.</b>
'In the third month' means fullness of state. This is clear from the meaning of 'month' as state, for all periods of time, such as days weeks, months, or years, mean states, <a href="2788.htm">2788</a>; and from the meaning 
of 'three' or 'third' as that which is complete, dealt with in <a href="1825.htm">1825</a>, <a href="2788.htm">2788</a>, <a href="4495.htm">4495</a>, <a href="5159.htm">5159</a>, <a href="7715.htm">7715</a>, so that 'in the third month' means in fullness of state. </p>
<p></p>
<p><b>[2]</b>
 What fullness of state is must be mentioned 
briefly. Every state has its beginning, period of development, and end. When a state reaches its end it is full or complete, and it is called fullness. In the next life all things are measured by the 
stages of development that their states undergo, and by the consecutive changes of those things from beginning to end, just as in the world they are measured by periods of time. This is so because 
in heaven there are no periods of time; instead there are states. The reason for this is that in the next life the Sun, which is the Lord, remains constantly in its place. It does not make apparent daily 
advances like the sun in the world, dividing the day into morning, midday, evening, and night, nor apparent yearly advances, dividing the year into spring, summer, autumn, and winter. So it is that 
in heaven there are no periods of time, but states instead. However, since within the inmost sphere of heaven a kind of advance or development takes place in accordance with the Divine heavenly form, 
which no one is capable of perceiving, and since the states of all in heaven change in accordance with that process of development, angels there pass through a cycle of states in which the good of love, 
the truth of faith, or obscurity in respect of both predominates. From this there arises the correspondence of states in heaven with periods of time in the world, that is to say, the state of the 
good of love with morning, the state of the truth of faith with midday, and the state of obscurity with evening and night. Furthermore the heat too that is radiated by the sun there is the good of love, 
while the light radiated by the sun there is the truth of faith. From this also there arises the correspondence of heat in the world with love, which is for that reason called spiritual heat, and 
of light in the world with faith, which is for this reason called spiritual light. </p>
<p></p>
<p><b>[3]</b>
 In general there are two states of life - the state of thought, a state which belongs to the understanding; and 
the state of affection, a state which belongs to the will. The state of thought belonging to the understanding is connected with the truth of faith. This state is one that is enlightened by light from 
the Sun of heaven, which is the Lord, even as this light is the source of light in the human understanding. But the state of affection belonging to the will is connected with the good of charity, even 
as the heat radiating from the Sun in heaven, which is the Lord, is the source of heat in the will, which is love. From all this one may now see the nature of the states and their changes in the next 
life, and what is implied by fullness of state, meant by 'the third month'. The state to which fullness is ascribed here is the first state which those belonging to the spiritual Church underwent; 
for these people undergo two states, the first being when the Lord leads them by means of truth, the second when He does so by means of good, see <a href="8643.htm">8643</a>, <a href="8648.htm">8648</a>, <a href="8658.htm">8658</a>, <a href="8685.htm">8685</a>, <a href="8690.htm">8690</a>, <a href="8701.htm">8701</a>. Here the fullness 
of the first state is meant, the state which has been described in what has gone before; now the second state is described. </p>

`In mense tertio': quod significet status plenitudinem, constat ex significatione `mensis' quod sit status, nam omnia (x)tempora, sicut dies, septimanae, menses, et anni, significant status, n. 2788, 
et ex significatione `trium' et `tertii' quod sit completum, de qua n. 1825, 2788, 4495, 5159, 7715; inde `in mense tertio' est {1}in status plenitudine. 	2 Quid plenitudo status, paucis dicetur: omnis 
status habet suum initium, suam progressionem, et suum finem; cum status ad finem suum pervenit, tunc est plenus, et vocatur plenitudo; in altera vita mensurantur omnia per status progressiones et 
{2}eorum mutationes successivas a principio ad finem, {3}sicut in mundo per tempora; quod ita fiat, est quia {4}in caelo non sunt tempora {5}, sed loco illorum status; causa est quia (m)Sol {6}in altera 
vita, qui est Dominus, permanet constanter in suo loco, nec sicut in mundo, per progressiones apparentes diurnas (x)distinguit diem in mane, meridiem, vesperam, et noctem, nec per progressiones apparentes 
annuas distinguit annum in ver, aestatem, autumnum, et hiemem; inde est quod in caelo non sint tempora, {7}sed loco illorum status; at quia in intima sphaera caeli est quaedam progressio secundum 
formam Divinam caelestem, quae ad nullius perceptionem venit, et secundum illam status omnium in caelo mutationes subeunt, inde est quod angeli ibi sint alternis in bono amoris, in vero fidei, inque 
obscuro quoad utrumque; ex eo est quod correspondentia sit statuum ibi cum temporibus in mundo, nempe status boni amoris cum mane, status veri fidei cum meridie, et status obscuri cum vespera et 
nocte; praeterea etiam calor qui ex sole ibi est bonum amoris, et lux quae ex sole ibi est verum fidei; inde quoque est quod correspondentia sit caloris in mundo cum amore, qui inde vocatur calor spiritualis, 
ut et lucis in mundo cum fide, quae {8}inde vocatur lux spiritualis {9}.(n) 	3 Sunt in genere {10} bini status vitae, nempe status cogitationis, qui est intellectus, (c)ac status affectionis, 
{11}qui est voluntatis; {12}status cogitationis qui intellectus se refert ad verum quod fidei; hic status est qui illustratur per lucem e sole caeli, qui est Dominus, etiam lux intellectus in homine 
est ex illa luce; status autem affectionis qui voluntatis se refert ad bonum quod charitatis, etiam calor voluntatis, qui est amor, in homine est ex calore e Sole illo, in caelo, qui est Dominus; ex 
his nunc constare potest quomodo se habet cum statibus et eorum mutationibus in altera vita, et quid intelligitur per status plenitudinem, quae significatur per `mensem tertium'; per statum hic, de quo 
praedicatur plenitudo, intelligitur status prior quem subiverunt illi qui ab Ecclesia spirituali; quod hi binos status subeant, primum cum per verum a Domino ducuntur, alterum cum per bonum ab Ipso,
