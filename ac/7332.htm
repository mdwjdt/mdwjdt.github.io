<h3 align="center" class="ired">属天的奥秘 第7332节</h3>
<h4 align="center"></h4><p><strong>7332.</strong>“河里的水都变作血了”表随之对一切真理的歪曲。这从“河里的水”和“血”的含义清楚可知：“河里的水”是指虚假，如前所述（<a href="7307.htm">7307</a>节）；“血”是指对真理的歪曲，也如前所述（<a href="7317.htm">7317</a>，<a href="7326.htm">7326</a>节）。在来世，那些沉浸于虚假并进行侵扰的人之所以被允许歪曲真理，一方面是为了防止他们通过信之真理与天堂里的人发生联系，另一方面是让他们通过邪恶的生活与地狱里的人建立联系。由此他们就根本不能利用这类联系通过真理获得任何来自天堂的光，因而获得任何聪明，并使这些真理服务于他们的邪恶生活。因为他们若能，就会利用他们所获得的聪明将邪恶合理化，从而使他们里面的天堂事物臣服于地狱事物；以这种方式也防止他们迷惑简单的正直灵人，因为他们通过真理与这些灵人有联系。此外，在来世，真理在其中尚未被歪曲的恶人也知道如何利用这些真理获得对他人的掌控，因为能力住在真理里面，并且如此之大，以致它是不可抗拒的（<a href="3091.htm">3091</a>，<a href="6344.htm">6344</a>，<a href="6423.htm">6423</a>，<a href="6948.htm">6948</a>节）；这是他们滥用真理的另一种方式。此外，恶人所知道的真理对于纠正他们的生活根本没有丝毫效果；他们只是利用这些真理作为手段来作恶；当恶人无法以这种方式利用它们时，就会彻底嘲笑真理。他们就像那些邪恶的牧师，这些牧师若不能利用教义的真理为自己谋利，就会嘲笑这些真理。这些就是恶人被允许歪曲他们所知道的真理的原因。</p>

<p align="center"><b>Potts(1905-1910) 7332</b></p><p><b>7332.</b>
And all the waters that were in the river were turned into blood. That this signifies the consequent falsification of all truth, is evident from the signification of "the waters that were in the river," 
as being falsities (of which above, n. 7307); and from the signification of "blood," as being the falsification of truth (of which also above, n. 7317, 7326). The reason why it is permitted that they 
who are in falsities and infest in the other life, should falsify truths, is lest through the truths which are of faith they should have communication with those who are in heaven, and through the 
evils which are of life; they should have communication with those who are in hell; and hence through truths should acquire something of light from heaven, and thus something of intelligence, and should 
make these serve the evils which are of life; for they would apply in favor of evil the things that belong to intelligence, and thus would subject the things of heaven in them to those of hell; and 
also lest they should seduce simple upright spirits, with whom they would have communication through the truths.  Moreover, the evil in the other life with whom truths have not yet been falsified, 
know how to acquire dominion by their means, for there is irresistible power in truths (n. 3091, 6344, 6423, 6948). Thus they would also abuse the truths. Moreover, truths with the evil have not the slightest 
effect toward the amendment of their lives; they merely use them as means to do evil; apart from this use they cover them with ridicule. They are like those evil clergymen who ridicule the truths 
of doctrine, unless these can be made profitable to them. These are the reasons why the evil are permitted to falsify the truths that pertain to them. </p>

<p align="center"><b>Elliott(1983-1999) 7332</b></p><p><b>7332.</b>
'And all the waters which were in the river were converted into blood' means consequent falsification of all truth. This is clear from the meaning of 'the waters which are in the river' as falsities, 
dealt with above in <a href="7707.htm">7707</a>; and from the meaning of 'blood' as the falsification of truth, also dealt with above, in <a href="7317.htm">7317</a>, <a href="7326.htm">7326</a>. The reason why those in the next life who are steeped in falsities and engage 
in molestation are allowed to falsify truths is that then they are prevented from having contact through the truths of faith with those who are in heaven on one hand, and through evils of life with 
those who are in hell on the other. Therefore they cannot use such contact to acquire through truths any light at all from heaven, thus any intelligence, and make those truths serve the evils of their 
life. For if they could they would use the intelligence they had gained to justify evil, and so to subordinate the things of heaven residing with them to those of hell. They are also prevented in 
this way from leading astray simple and upright spirits with whom they have contact through truths. The evil in the next life among whom truths have not yet been falsified also know how to use those 
truths to gain control over others (for power resides within truths, so great that it is irresistible, <a href="3091.htm">3091</a>, <a href="6344.htm">6344</a>, <a href="6427.htm">6427</a>, <a href="6948.htm">6948</a>); and this is another way in which they would misuse truths. Furthermore the 
truths the evil know do not amend their lives in any way at all. They use them merely as means to do evil; when they cannot use them in this way the evil utterly deride truths. They are like wicked 
prelates who would ridicule the truths of doctrine if they could not use those truths for their own profit. These are the reasons why the evil are allowed to falsify the truths they know. </p>

`Et conversae sunt omnes aquae quae in fluvio in sanguinem': quod significet inde falsificationem omnis veri, constat ex significatione `aquarum quae in fluvio' quod sint falsa, de qua supra n. 7307; 
et ex significatione `sanguinis' quod sit falsificatio veri, de qua etiam supra n. 7317, 7326.  Quod permittatur {1}quod illi qui in falsis (c)et infestant in altera vita, falsificent vera, est causa 
ne per vera quae {2}fidei communicationem habeant cum illis qui in caelo, et per mala quae sunt vitae communicationem habeant cum illis equi in inferno, et inde per vera acquirant sibi aliquid lucis 
e caelo, et sic aliquid intelligentiae, (c)et faciant ut ea serviant malis quae vitae, nam ad favorem mali applicarent illa quae intelligentiae sunt, ac sic illa quae caeli subjicerent apud se illis 
quae inferni; et quoque ne seducerent simplices probos spiritus cum quibus per vera communicationem habent; sciunt etiam mali in altera vita apud quos vera nondum falsificata sunt per illa sibi dominium 
acquirere, nam potentia inest veris, usque adeo ut non resisti queat, n. 3091, 6344, (x)6423; 6948, inde quoque abuterentur veris; {3}praeterea vera apud malos nihil prorsus ad emendationem vitae eorum 
efficiunt, sed mali modo utuntur illis ut mediis ad faciendum malum, absque illo usu mali prorsus irrident vera; {4}sunt sicut (t)mali antistites qui si non doctrinae vera inserviant illis pro mediis 
(x)lucrandi, illa {5}subsannarent; hae {6} causae sunt cur (t)permittitur malis ut apud se vera falsificent. 	@1 ut$ 	@2 doctrinae$ 	@3 nam apud malos vera prorsus nihil efficiunt, ad refraenandas
