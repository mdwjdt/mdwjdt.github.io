<h4 align="center"></h4><p><strong>10250</strong>.“耶和华晓谕摩西说”表由通过圣言来自主的光照或启示所产生的进一步的觉察。这从前面的解释（<a href="10215.htm">10215</a>节）清楚可知，那里有相同的话。之所以表示进一步的觉察，是因为当有某种新事物被揭示和颁布时，经上就如此说（参看<a href="10234.htm">10234</a>节）。</p>

Verses 22-33. And Jehovah spoke unto Moses, saying, And do thou take to thee chief spices, best myrrh five hundred, and aromatic cinnamon the half thereof two hundred and fifty, and aromatic calamus 
two hundred and fifty, and cassia five hundred, in the shekel of holiness; and oil of olive a hin. And thou shalt make it an oil of anointing of holiness, an ointment of ointment, the work of a perfumer; 
it shall be an oil of anointing of holiness. And thou shalt anoint with it the Tent of meeting, and the ark of the Testimony, and the table and all the vessels thereof, and the lampstand and the vessels 
thereof, and the altar of incense, and the altar of burnt-offering, with all the vessels thereof, and the laver and its base. And thou shalt sanctify them, and they shall be a holy of holies; whosoever 
toucheth them shall be made holy. And thou shalt anoint Aaron and his sons, and shalt sanctify them to minister to Me in the priest's office. And thou shalt speak unto the sons of Israel, saying, 
This shall be to Me an oil of anointing of holiness to your generations. Upon the flesh of man shall it not be poured; and in the quality thereof ye shall not make any like it; holy is this; holy 
shall it be to you. The man who shall make ointment like it, and who shall put of it upon a stranger, he shall be cut off from his peoples. "And Jehovah spoke unto Moses, saying" signifies another perceptivity 
from enlightenment through the Word by the Lord; "and do thou take to thee chief spices" signifies truths with goods, from the Word, which are gratefully perceived; "best myrrh" signifies the 
perception of sensuous truth; "five hundred" signifies full; "and aromatic cinnamon" signifies the perception and affection of natural truth; "the half thereof, two hundred and fifty" signifies the 
corresponding quantity; "and aromatic calamus" signifies the perception and affection of interior truth; "two hundred and fifty" signifies the corresponding quantity and quality; "and cassia" signifies 
truth still more interior from good; "five hundred" signifies full; "in the shekel of holiness" signifies the estimation of truth and good; "and oil of olive" signifies the Lord's Divine celestial 
good; "a hin" signifies the quantity for conjunction; "and thou shalt make an oil of anointing of holiness" signifies a representative of the Divine good of the Lord's Divine love; "an ointment of ointment" 
signifies in each and all things of His Human; "the work of a perfumer" signifies from the influx and operation of the Divine Itself which was in the Lord from conception; "it shall be an oil of 
anointing of holiness" signifies a representative of the Lord as to the Divine Human; "and thou shalt anoint with it the Tent of meeting" signifies to represent the Divine of the Lord in the heavens; 
"and the ark of the Testimony" signifies in the celestial good that belongs to the inmost heaven; "and the table and all the vessels thereof" signifies in spiritual good from the celestial, that belongs 
to the second heaven, and in the ministering goods and truths; "and the lampstand and the vessels thereof" signifies in spiritual truth, that belongs to the second heaven, and in the ministering 
truths; "and the altar of incense" signifies in all things of worship from these goods and truths; "and the altar of burnt-offering" signifies to represent the Divine Human of the Lord and the worship 
of Him in general; "with all the vessels thereof" signifies Divine goods and Divine truths; "and the laver and its base" signifies all things that belong to purification from evils and falsities, and 
to regeneration by the Lord"; and thou shalt sanctify them, and they shall be a Holy of holies" signifies in this way the influx and presence of the Lord in the worship of the representative church; 
"whosoever toucheth them shall be made holy" signifies that which is communicative to all who receive in love and faith; "and thou shalt anoint Aaron and his sons" signifies inauguration to represent 
the Lord in both kingdoms; "and shalt sanctify them to minister to Me in the priest's office" signifies to represent the Lord in respect to all the work of salvation; "and thou shalt speak unto the sons 
of Israel, saying" signifies instruction for those who are of the church; "this shall be to Me an oil of anointing of holiness" signifies a representative of the Lord as to the Divine Human; "to your 
generations" signifies in all things of the church; "upon the flesh of man shall it not be poured" signifies no capability of communication with man's own; "and in the quality thereof ye shall not 
make any like it" signifies no imitation from the study of man; "holy is this, holy shall it be to you" signifies because it is the Divine of the Lord; "the man who shall make ointment like it" signifies 
the imitation of Divine things by art; "and who shall put of it upon a stranger" signifies conjunction with those who do not acknowledge the Lord, thus who are in evils and the falsities of evil; 
"he shall be cut off from his peoples" signifies separation and spiritual death. </p>
<p>10250a. And Jehovah spoke unto Moses, saying. That this signifies another perceptivity from enlightenment through the 
Word by the Lord, is evident from what was unfolded above (n. 10215), where are the like words. That another perceptivity is meant, is because it is so said when anything new is revealed and commanded 
(see n. 10234). </p>

'And Jehovah spoke to Moses, saying' means further perception as a result of enlightenment from the Lord through the Word. This is clear from the explanation above in <a href="10215.htm">10215</a>, where the same words occur. 
The reason why further perception is meant is that when something new is being revealed and decreed, those words are used, see <a href="10234.htm">10234</a>.  </p>

{1} `Et locutus est Jehovah ad Moschen, dicendo': quod significet aliud perceptivum ex illustratione per Verbum (c)a Domino, constat ex illis quae supra n. 10,215 explicata sunt, ubi similia verba; quod 
sit aliud perceptivum, est quia cum aliquid e novo revelatur et mandatur, ita (x)dicitur, videatur n. 10,234. @1 10,250 AI, 10,250 [1/2] T$ </p>
