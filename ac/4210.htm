<h3 align="center" class="ired">属天的奥秘 第4210节</h3>
<h4 align="center"></h4><p><strong>4210.</strong>“雅各又在山上献祭”表出于爱之良善的敬拜。这从“献祭”和“山”的含义清楚可知：“献祭”是指敬拜（参看<a href="922.htm">922</a>，<a href="923.htm">923</a>，<a href="2180.htm">2180</a>节）；“山”是指爱之良善（<a href="795.htm">795</a>，<a href="796.htm">796</a>，<a href="1430.htm">1430</a>节）。“献祭”之所以表示敬拜，是因为献祭和燔祭是后来的代表性教会，也就是希伯来教会中一切敬拜的主要事物。他们也在山上献祭，这一点从圣言各处明显看出来，因为“山”因其高而表示高处的事物，就是诸如属于天堂、被称作属天的那类事物；因此，它们在至高意义上表示主，这些人称主为至高者。他们出于表象而以这种方式思考，因为更内在的事物看似在更高处，如天堂在人看来似乎在高处。其实天堂就在他的内心深处，然而人却以为天堂在高处。这就是为何在圣言中，当经上提到“高或高处”一词时，它在内义上表示内在事物的原因。<br />在世上，人们不可避免地以为天堂在高处，既因为“天堂”一词就用于在我们上面铺展开的可见穹苍；还因为人居于时空中，并出于源自时空的观念如此思想，又因为很少有人知道何为内在事物，更很少有人知道那里并没有空间和时间。正因如此，圣言的语言符合人的思想观念；若不符合人的思想观念，而是符合天使的观念，那么人什么也意识不到；相反，人人都会困惑，这是什么，它究竟是不是某种东西，因而早就会把它当作无法理解的事物而加以弃绝了。</p>

<p align="center"><b>Potts(1905-1910) 4210</b></p><p><b>4210.</b>
And Jacob sacrificed a sacrifice in the mountain. That this signifies worship from the good of love, is evident from the signification of a "sacrifice," as being worship (see n. 922, 923, 2180); and 
from the signification of a "mountain," as being the good of love (n. 795, 796, 1430). "Sacrifice" signifies worship because sacrifices and burnt-offerings were the chief things of all the worship in 
the later or Hebrew representative church. They also sacrificed on mountains, as is evident from various passages in the Word, because "mountains," from their height, signified things which are high, 
such as are those which are of heaven and are called celestial; and hence in the supreme sense they signified the Lord, whom these people called the Most High. They thought in this way from the appearance, 
for things which are more interior appear higher, as does heaven to man. This is interiorly within him, yet man supposes that it is on high. For this reason where what is high is mentioned in the 
Word, in the internal sense there is signified that which is interior. In the world it must be supposed that heaven is on high, both because the visible heavens spread above us are so called, and because 
man is in time and place, and therefore thinks from ideas thence derived; and also because few know what that which is interior is, and still fewer that there is there neither place nor time. It 
is for this reason that the language of the Word is in agreement with the ideas of man's thought; and if instead of being so it had been in accordance with angelic ideas, the result would have been that 
men would have perceived nothing at all; but everyone would have stood wondering what it was, and whether it was anything at all, and so would have rejected it as being destitute of anything fit for 
the understanding. </p>

<p align="center"><b>Elliott(1983-1999) 4210</b></p><p><b>4210.</b>
'Jacob offered a sacrifice on the mountain' means worship founded on good that stems from love. This is clear from the meaning of 'a sacrifice' as worship, dealt with in <a href="922.htm">922</a>, <a href="923.htm">923</a>, <a href="2180.htm">2180</a>, and from the 
meaning of 'the mountain' as good that stems from love, <a href="795.htm">795</a>, <a href="796.htm">796</a>, <a href="1430.htm">1430</a>. 'A sacrifice' means worship because sacrifices and burnt offerings were the major features of all worship in the later representative 
Church, which was the Hebrew Church. They also used to sacrifice on mountains, as is clear from various places in the Word, because 'mountains' on account of their height meant the things which 
were high, such as those are which belong to heaven and are called heavenly; and having this meaning they also meant, in the highest sense, the Lord, whom they called the Most High. It was the outward 
appearance that led them to think in this way, for the things that are interior give the appearance of being higher, as heaven does with man. Heaven is interiorly within him, and yet he supposes it to 
be on high. This is the reason why, when the expression 'high' is used in the Word, that which is interior is meant in the internal sense. </p>
<p></p>
<p><b>[2]</b>
 In the world people inevitably take heaven to be on 
high. One reason why they do so is that the word 'heaven' is used for the visible expanse which encircles them on high and another is that man is a dweller within time and space and so thinks from ideas 
derived from these. And a further reason is that few are aware of what anything interior may be, and fewer still are aware that neither place nor time exist there. This is why the mode of expression 
employed in the Word is one that accords with the ideas present in man's thought. If it had not accorded with those ideas but with angelic ideas man would have perceived nothing at all, but everyone 
would have stood wondering what it was and whether it was anything at all, and so would have rejected it as being devoid of anything intelligible. </p>

`Sacrificavit Jacob sacrificium in monte': quod significet cultum ex bono amoris, constat (c)ex significatione `sacrificii' quod sit cultus, de qua n. 922, 923, 2180; et ex significatione `montis' 
quod sit bonum amoris, de qua n. 795, 796, 1430; </p>
<p>`sacrificium' significat cultum quia sacrificia et holocausta fuerunt principalia omnis cultus in Ecclesia repraesentativa postera seu Hebraea; in 
montibus etiam sacrificabant, ut quoque passim ex Verbo constat, quia `montes' ex altitudine significabant illa quae alta essent, ut sunt illa quae caeli, ac caelestia vocantur, (c)et inde (t)in supremo 
sensu significabant Dominum, Quem Altissimum vocarunt; ex apparentia ita putarunt, nam quae interiora sunt, apparent sicut altiora, prout caelum apud hominem; </p>
<p>hoc interius est in illo, at usque 
{1} autumat homo quod in alto sit; inde est quod ubi `altum' in Verbo dicitur, in sensu interno significetur interius; [2] in mundo non aliter sciri potest quam quod caelum sit in alto, tam ex 
eo quod caelum quoque dicatur illud aspectabile quod circum circa in alto est, quam {2} quia homo in tempore et loco est, et sic cogitat ex ideis quae inde, et quoque ex eo quod pauci sciant quid interius, 
et adhuc pauciores quod ibi non locus nec tempus; inde est quod secundum ideas cogitationis hominis locutum sit in Verbo; si non secundum illas sed secundum ideas angelicas, tunc homo ne hilum 
percepisset, sed quisque mirabundus stetisset, quid illud, et num aliquid, et sic rejecisset sicut quoddam in quo nihil intellectui simile foret.      @1 i ex apparentia$      @2 tum$ </p>
