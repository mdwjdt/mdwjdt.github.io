<h3 align="center" class="ired">属天的奥秘 第10131节</h3>
<h4 align="center"></h4><p><strong>10131</strong>.“这就是你每天所要献在坛上的”表在天堂和教会中，总体上涉及对主的接受之物。这从“这就是你每天所要献在坛上的”的含义清楚可知，“这就是你每天所要献在坛上的”是指在天堂中，总体上涉及对主的接受之物。因为“坛”表示天堂里的主之神性（参看<a href="10129.htm">10129</a>节），因而也指对祂的接受；而“这就是你所要献在坛上的”表示总体上涉及它之物。因为接下来的话论及要每天献上的羔羊燔祭，这些供物代表总体上涉及对主的接受之物。“羔羊”表示纯真之良善，纯真之良善是唯一接受主的东西，因为没有纯真之良善，对主的爱是不可能存在的，对邻之仁，以及凡含有生命在里面的信也是不可能存在的，总体上凡含有神性之物在里面的良善同样不可能存在（参看<a href="10021.htm">10021</a>节提到的地方）。这就是为何“这就是你每天所要献在坛上的”表示在天堂和教会中，总体上涉及对主的接受之物。当说到“天堂”时，也是指教会，因为主在地上的天堂就是教会；教会在谁里面，天堂也在谁里面；因为主在他里面；主在哪里，天堂就在哪里。此外，教会与天堂构成一体，因为它们联结在一起，不可分割，彼此依赖。将它们联结在一起的，是圣言；圣言有主在里面，主就是圣言（约翰福音<a href="http://39-27.cn/约1.1.htm">1:1</a>ff）。</p>

And this is what thou shalt offer upon the altar. That this signifies that which in general concerns the reception of the Lord in heaven and in the church, is evident from the signification of "this 
is what thou shalt offer upon the altar," as being that which in general concerns the reception of the Lord in the heavens. For by "the altar" is signified the Divine of the Lord in the heavens (see n. 
10129); thus also the reception of Him; and by "this thou shalt offer upon it" is signified that which in general concerns it. For there follows the subject of the daily burnt-offerings, and by these 
is represented in general that which concerns the reception of the Lord; for by "lambs" is signified the good of innocence, and the good of innocence is the only thing that receives the Lord, because 
without the good of innocence love to the Lord is not possible, nor charity toward the neighbor, nor faith that has life in it, nor in general any good in which is the Divine (see the places cited in 
n. 10021). Hence it is that by "this thou shalt offer upon the altar," is signified that which in general concerns the reception of the Lord in heaven and in the church. When heaven is spoken of, the 
church is also meant, for the heaven of the Lord on earth is the church; and in whomsoever the church is, in him also is heaven; for the Lord is in him; and where the Lord is, there is heaven. Moreover, 
the church makes one with heaven, for the one depends upon the other by an indissoluble connection. It is the Word which conjoins; in the Word is the Lord, and the Lord is the Word (John 1:1, and 
following verses). </p>

'And this is what you shall offer on the altar' means that which has regard in general to reception of the Lord in heaven and in the Church. This is clear from the meaning of 'this is what you shall 
offer on the altar' as that which has regard in general to reception of the Lord in the heavens; for 'the altar' means what is Divine and the Lord's in the heavens, <a href="10129.htm">10129</a>, thus also the reception of Him, 
while 'this you shall offer on it' means that which has regard in general [to the reception]. For the words that come next refer to the burnt offerings of lambs that were to be presented daily, and 
these offerings represent in general that which has regard to reception of the Lord. By 'lambs' the good of innocence is meant, and the good of innocence is the one and only thing that receives the 
Lord. For without the good of innocence there can be no love to the Lord, nor can there be any charity towards the neighbour or any faith that has life within it; in general there can be no good that 
has what is Divine within it, see the places referred to in <a href="10021.htm">10021</a>. This is why 'this you shall offer on the altar' means that which has regard in general to reception of the Lord in heaven and in the 
Church. When the word 'heaven' is used the Church should also be understood, since the Lord's heaven on earth is the Church, and each individual person in whom the Church exists has heaven as well within 
him; for the Lord is within him, and where the Lord is, so is heaven. Furthermore the Church makes one with heaven, for they are linked together inseparably and are dependent each on the other. The 
Word is what joins them together; the Word has the Lord within it, and the Lord is the Word, <a href="http://bible.gospelcom.net/cgi-bin/bible?passage=John%201:1&amp;version=ESV&amp;interface=print&amp;showfn=yes&amp;showxref">John 1:1</a>ff.  </p>

</p><b>10131.</b>
`Et hoc quod facies super altari': quod significet quod in genere concernit receptionem Domini in caelo et in Ecclesia, constat ex significatione `hoc quod facies super altari' quod sit quod in genere 
concernit receptionem Domini in caelis, per `altare' enim significatur Divinum Domini in caelis, n. 10,129, ita quoque receptio Ipsius, et per `hoc facies super illo' significatur quod in genere concernit; 
nam sequitur de holocaustis ex agnis quotidie, et per illa repraesentatur in genere quod concernit receptionem Domini, per `agnos' enim significatur bonum innocentiae, et bonum innocentiae est 
unicum quod recipit Dominum, nam absque bono innocentiae non datur amor in Dominum, nec datur charitas erga proximum, nec fides quae vitam in se habet, in genere non bonum in quo Divinum, (o)videantur 
citata n. 10,021; inde est quod per `hoc facies super altari' significetur quod in genere concernit receptionem Domini in caelo et in Ecclesia.  Cum dicitur caelum, etiam intelligitur Ecclesia, nam 
caelum Domini in terris est Ecclesia, et unusquisque in quo est Ecclesia, in illo etiam est caelum, est enim Dominus in illo, et ubi Dominus ibi caelum; (m)etiam Ecclesia unum facit cum caelo, pendet 
enim unum ab altero nexu indivulso; Verbum est quod conjungit, in Verbo est Dominus, et Dominus est Verbum, Joh. i 1 seq.(n) </p>
