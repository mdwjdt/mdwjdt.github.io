<h3 align="center" class="ired">属天的奥秘 第7877节</h3>
<h4 align="center"></h4><p><strong>7877.</strong>“我一见这血”表那些施加诅咒的人对这真理的发现。这从“见”和“血”的含义清楚可知：“见”是指理解并发现（参看<a href="2150.htm">2150</a>，<a href="2325.htm">2325</a>，<a href="2807.htm">2807</a>，<a href="3764.htm">3764</a>，<a href="4403.htm">4403</a>-<a href="4421.htm">4421</a>，<a href="4567.htm">4567</a>，<a href="4723.htm">4723</a>，<a href="5400.htm">5400</a>节），下文将说明，它是指那些施加诅咒之人的一个发现；“血”是指纯真之良善的真理，如前所述（<a href="7846.htm">7846</a>节）。<br />必须说一说何为纯真之良善的真理。纯真的良善是对主之爱的良善；因为那些处于这爱的人拥有纯真在自己里面。这解释了为何在至内层或第三层天堂的天使比其他天使拥有更多的纯真，因为他们处于对主之爱。那里的天使由于纯真而在其他人看来就像小孩子，然而，他们却是天上最有智慧的天使（参看<a href="2306.htm">2306</a>节）；因为纯真居于智慧之中（参看<a href="2305.htm">2305</a>，<a href="3494.htm">3494</a>，<a href="4797.htm">4797</a>节）。与他们同在的纯真之良善的真理并非信之真理，而是仁之良善。在第三层天堂的天使不知道何为信，因而不知道何为信之真理；因为他们凭直觉感知构成信的真理，在凭直觉感知它的过程中立刻知道它的确是真理。他们从来不推理它是不是真理，更不会彼此争论它。以直觉的方式所感知到的东西不会落入记忆知识的范畴。在第二层天堂的天使则不然，信之真理把他们引向仁之良善。因此，他们会推理它是不是真理，因为他们不能直觉它是不是真理。于是，真理变成了他们所获利的记忆知识，并被称为构成信的教义事物。<br />那些在至内层或第三层天堂的天使处于这样一种状态：他们能直觉何为信之真理，因而不会把它添加到他们所获利的记忆知识中（参看<a href="202.htm">202</a>，<a href="337.htm">337</a>，<a href="2715.htm">2715</a>，<a href="2718.htm">2718</a>，<a href="3246.htm">3246</a>，<a href="4448.htm">4448</a>节）。至于为何耶和华说“我一见”，因而指着自己说这话表示那些施加诅咒的人，也就是地狱灵的一个发现，这从前面的说明可以看出来，即：邪恶被归于耶和华或主，尽管邪恶丝毫不来自主，而是来自地狱（<a href="2447.htm">2447</a>，<a href="6071.htm">6071</a>，<a href="6991.htm">6991</a>，<a href="6997.htm">6997</a>，<a href="7533.htm">7533</a>，<a href="7632.htm">7632</a>，<a href="7643.htm">7643</a>节）。被许可的邪恶看似来自许可它的主，因为主能除去它。此处就是这种情形，因为经上说埃及人的长子被处死。这事被归于耶和华，因为经上说：<br />那夜我要巡行埃及地，把埃及地一切头生的都击杀了；到了半夜，耶和华把埃及地所有的长子，就是从坐宝座的法老的长子，直到被关在坑牢里的囚犯的长子，尽都击杀了。（出埃及记<a href="http://39-27.cn/出12.12.htm">12:12</a>，<a href="http://39-27.cn/出12.29.htm">29</a>）<br />然而在本节，做这事的人被称为“灭命的”：“这血要在你们所住的房屋上作记号，我一见这血，就越过你们去，灾殃必不临到你们身上作灭命的”。<br />恶人在来世所经历的荒凉，受到的诅咒并被投入地狱也是这种情形，这些事在内义上由“灾殃”、长子的死和埃及人淹死在红海中来表示。耶和华或主不会使任何人荒凉，更不会诅咒人，或把人投入地狱。相反，是恶灵自己向自己行这一切，也就是说，行这一切的，是他里面的邪恶。这就是为何“我一见血”表示那些施加诅咒之人的一个发现。<br />至于许可，它是无法以三言两语来说明的，因为它涉及众多奥秘。当恶人遭受诅咒和折磨时，主的许可不像想要它发生之人的许可，而是像不希望它发生，但又无法帮助他们之人的许可，因为祂的目的，就是对整个人类的救赎，是紧迫的，并阻止祂去帮助。事实上，如果祂真的帮助他们，那将是行恶，这完全违反神性。不过，关于这个主题，蒙主的神性怜悯，我们将在别处予以详述。</p>

<p align="center"><b>Potts(1905-1910) 7877</b></p><p><b>7877.</b>
And I shall see the blood. That this signifies the noticing of this truth by those who inflict the damnation, is evident from the signification of "to see," as being to understand and to notice (see 
n. 2150, 2325, 2807, 3764, 4403-4421, 4567, 4723, 5400), that it denotes a noticing by those who inflict the damnation, follows below; and from the signification of "blood," as being the truth of the 
good of innocence (as above, n. 7846). [2] What the truth of the good of innocence is, must be told. The good of innocence is the good of love to the Lord; for they who are in this love are in innocence. 
Therefore they who are in the inmost or third heaven are in innocence in advance of the rest, because they are in love to the Lord. From innocence they who are there appear to others like little 
children, and yet they are the wisest of all who are in heaven (see n. 2306); for innocence dwells in wisdom (see n. 2305, 3494, 4797). The truth of the good of innocence which is with them is not the 
truth of faith, but is the good of charity. For they who are in the third heaven do not know what faith is; thus neither do they know what its truth is; for they are in the perception of the truth that 
is of faith, from which they instantly know that a thing is so; nor do they ever reason about it, whether it be so, still less dispute about it. That they are in perception in this manner, does not 
fall within the scope of memory-knowledge. It is otherwise with the spiritual, who are in the second heaven. These are led to the good which is of charity through the truth which is of faith; and therefore 
they reason whether a thing is true, or not, because they do not perceive whether it is; consequently with them truths become memory-knowledge, and are called doctrinal things of faith.  [3] (That 
they who are in the inmost or third heaven are in such a state that they perceive what is the truth of faith, and therefore do not refer it to memory-knowledge, see n. 202, 337, 2715, 2718, 3246, 
4448.) How it is that by Jehovah's saying, "I shall see," thus saying it concerning Himself, is signified a noticing by those who inflict damnation, that is, by the infernals, can be seen from what has 
been shown above, namely, that evil is attributed to Jehovah, or the Lord, although nothing of evil comes forth from Him, but from hell (n. 2447, 6071, 6991, 6997, 7533, 7632, 7643). That evil is permitted, 
has the appearance as if it were from him who permits, seeing that he has the power to take it away. Thus in the present case, that the firstborn of the Egyptians were given to death, is attributed 
to Jehovah, for it is said, "I will pass through the land of Egypt in that night, and will smite all the firstborn in the land of Egypt; and it came to pass at midnight that Jehovah smote all 
the firstborn in the land of Egypt, from the firstborn of Pharaoh about to sit upon his throne unto the firstborn of the captive that was in the house of the pit" (verses 12, 29); and yet in this verse 
he is called "a destroyer" who does this: "the blood shall be to you for a sign upon the houses where ye are; and I shall see the blood, and I will pass over you, and there shall not be in you a plague 
for a destroyer." [4] The case is similar with respect to the devastation of the evil in the other life, and the damnation and casting down into hell, which in the internal sense are meant by the 
"plagues," and by the death of the firstborn, and by the immersion in the sea Suph. Jehovah, or the Lord, vastates no one, still less damns and casts down into hell; but it is the evil spirit himself 
who does this to himself: it is the evil that is in him. From this then it is that by "I shall see the blood" is signified a noticing by those who inflict damnation.  [5] How the case is with permission 
cannot be told in a few words, because it involves very many arcana. That the wicked are damned and are tormented, is not a permission from the Lord as of one who wills it, but as of one who does 
not will, but cannot bring a remedy in view of the urgency and resistance of the end, which is the salvation of the whole human race; for if He were to bring a remedy, it would be doing evil, which is 
quite contrary to the Divine. But on this subject, of the Lord's Divine mercy more will be said elsewhere. </p>

<p align="center"><b>Elliott(1983-1999) 7877</b></p><p><b>7877.</b>
'And I will see the blood' means the discernment of that truth by those who inflict damnation. This is clear from the meaning of 'seeing' as understanding and discerning, dealt with in <a href="2150.htm">2150</a>, <a href="2325.htm">2325</a>, <a href="2807.htm">2807</a>, <a href="3764.htm">3764</a>, <a href="4403.htm">4403</a>-<a href="4421.htm">4421</a>, <a href="4567.htm">4567</a>, <a href="4723.htm">4723</a>, <a href="5400.htm">5400</a> (its being the discernment by those who inflict damnation is shown in what follows); and from the meaning of 'the blood' as truth that belongs to the good of innocence, 
as above in <a href="7846.htm">7846</a>. </p>
<p></p>
<p><b>[2]</b>
 What truth belonging to the good of innocence is must be stated. The good of innocence is the good of love to the Lord; for those governed by this love have innocence within 
them. This explains why those who are in the inmost or third heaven, being governed by love to the Lord, possess more innocence than all others. Because of their innocence those who are there look 
to others like young children, and yet they are the wisest of all in heaven, see <a href="2306.htm">2306</a>; for innocence resides within wisdom, <a href="2305.htm">2305</a>, <a href="3495.htm">3495</a>, <a href="4797.htm">4797</a>. The truth belonging to the good of innocence which exists 
with them is not the truth of faith but the good of charity. Those in the third heaven do not know what faith is, nor consequently what the truth of faith is; for they perceive intuitively the truth 
that composes faith, and in perceiving it intuitively know immediately that it is indeed the truth. They never engage in reasoning about whether it is such, let alone argue with one another about it. 
What is perceived in that intuitive way does not then come to be acquired knowledge. It is different with spiritual angels in the second heaven. The truth of faith leads them to the good of charity. 
They do therefore engage in reasoning about whether it is the truth or not, since they have no intuitive perception of whether it is or not. Truths then become knowledge they have acquired and are called 
matters of doctrine composing faith. </p>
<p></p>
<p><b>[3]</b>
 For more about those in the inmost or third heaven, about their state being such that they perceive intuitively what the truth of faith is and do not therefore 
add it to their acquired knowledge, see <a href="202.htm">202</a>, <a href="337.htm">337</a>, <a href="2715.htm">2715</a>, <a href="2718.htm">2718</a>, <a href="3246.htm">3246</a>, <a href="4448.htm">4448</a>. </p>
<p>Why it is that Jehovah's words 'I will see', thus something said about Himself, mean discernment by those who inflict 
damnation, that is, by spirits from hell, may become evident from what has been shown before about the attribution of evil to Jehovah or the Lord, though in fact no evil at all comes from Him but 
from hell, see <a href="2447.htm">2447</a>, <a href="6071.htm">6071</a>, <a href="6991.htm">6991</a>, <a href="6997.htm">6997</a>, <a href="7533.htm">7533</a>, <a href="7632.htm">7632</a>, <a href="7643.htm">7643</a>. Evil which is permitted to exist seems to come from Him who permits it, since He is able to remove it. That is how it is here when it says that 
the firstborn of the Egyptians were put to death. It is attributed to Jehovah, for it says in verses 12 and <a href="29.htm">29</a>,  </p>
<p>I will go through the land of Egypt on that night, and will strike all the firstborn 
in the land of Egypt. </p>
<p>And it happened at midnight, that Jehovah struck all the firstborn in the land of Egypt, from Pharaoh's firstborn who was to sit on his throne, even to the firstborn of the 
prisoner who was in the dungeon. </p>
<p>Yet in the present verse the one to do this is called 'the destroyer', </p>
<p>The blood will be a sign for you on the houses where you are; and I will see the blood and 
will pass you by, and the plague will not be on you for the destroyer. </p>
<p></p>
<p><b>[4]</b>
 It is similar with the vastation undergone by the evil in the next life, their damnation, and their being cast into hell, 
which are meant in the internal sense by the plagues, the death of the firstborn, and their being drowned in the Sea Suph. Jehovah or the Lord does not subject anyone to vastation, still less damn or 
cast into hell. Rather an evil spirit himself is the one who does it to himself, that is, the evil within him does it. This then is why 'I will see the blood' means a discernment by those who inflict 
damnation. </p>
<p></p>
<p><b>[5]</b>
 As regards permission, it is impossible to state briefly the nature of it since a very large number of arcana are involved in it. When the wicked suffer damnation and torment the Lord's 
permission is not like that of one who desires what happens to them. It is like that of one who does not desire it yet cannot help them because His end in view, which is the salvation of the entire 
human race, is urgent and prevents Him from helping. For if He were to help them, that would be doing ill, which is completely contrary to the Divine. But more on these matters will in the Lord's Divine 
mercy be stated elsewhere. </p>

`Et videro sanguinem': quod significet apperceptionem illius veri ab illis qui damnationem inferunt, constat ex significatione `videre' quod sit intelligere et appercipere, de qua n. 2150, 2325, 2807, 
3764, 4403-4421, 4567, 4723, 5400; quod sit apperceptio ab illis qui damnationem inferunt, sequitur; et ex significatione `sanguinis' quod sit verum boni innocentiae, ut supra n. 7846. 	2 Quid verum 
boni innocentiae, dicendum: bonum innocentiae est bonum amoris in Dominum; qui enim in hoc amore sunt in innocentia sunt; inde est quod illi qui in intimo seu tertio caelo sunt in innocentia sint prae 
reliquis quia in amore in Dominum {1}; ex innocentia apparent illi qui ibi, aliis sicut infantes, et usque sunt sapientissimi omnium qui in caelo, videatur n. 2306, nam innocentia habitat in sapientia, 
n. 2305, 3495, 4797; verum boni innocentiae quod apud illos non est verum fidei sed est bonum charitatis; nam illi qui in tertio caelo sunt non sciunt quid fides, ita nec quid verum ejus, sunt enim 
in perceptione veri quod fidei, ex qua sciunt ilico quod ita sit, nec usquam ratiocinantur de illo num ita sit, minus litigant de illo; quod eo modo in perceptione est, hoc non cadit in scientiam; 
aliter apud spirituales qui in secundo caelo; hi per verum quod fidei (x)ducuntur ad bonum quod charitatis, quare illi ratiocinantur num id verum sit vel non, quia num sit non percipiunt, inde vera illis 
fiunt scientia, et vocantur doctrinalia fidei. 	3 Quod illi qui in intimo seu tertio caelo in tali statu sint, quod percipiant quid verum fidei, ac ideo illud non ad scientiam referant,videatur 
n. 202, 337, 2715, 2718, 3246, 4448.  {2}Quomodo cum hoc se habet quod a Jehovah dicatur `videro,' ita de Se, significetur apperceptio ab illis qui damnationem inferunt, hoc est, ab infernalibus, patere 
potest (c)ab illis quae prius {3} ostensa sunt, quod nempe malum tribuatur Jehovae seu Domino, tametsi nihil mali ab Ipso {4}provenit, sed ab inferno, videatur n. 2447, (x)6071, 6991, 6997, 7533, (x)7632, 
7643; quod malum permittatur, hoc apparet sicut ab Ipso Qui permittit, cum potest auferre; ita hic quod morti dati sint primogeniti Aegyptiorum; hoc tribuitur Jehovae, nam dicitur, `Transibo per 
terram Aegypti in nocte illa, et percutiam omne primogenitum in terra Aegypti: et factum in media nocte, et jehovah percussit omne primogenitum in terra Aegypti, a primogenito Pharaonis sessuro super 
throno illius, usque ad primogenitum captivi qui in domo foveae,' vers. 12, 29; et tamen in hoc versu vocatur illi `perditor' qui hoc facit, `Erit sanguis vobis ad signum super domibus ubi vos, et 
videro sanguinem, et praeteribo praeter vos, et non erit vobis plaga 4 perditori'; similiter se habet cum devastatione malorum in altera vita, deque damnatione, et {5} dejectione in infernum, quae in 
sensu interno per plagas, et {5} per mortem primogenitorum {6}, et per immersionem in mare Suph, intelliguntur; Jehovah seu Dominus nullum vastat, minus damnat et in infernum dejicit; sed est ipse spiritus 
malus qui hoc sibi facit, hoc est, est malum quod in illo; inde nunc est quod per `videro sanguinem' significetur apperceptio ab illis qui damnationem inferunt. 	5 Quomodo cum permissione se habet, 
non potest paucis dici quia perplura arcana involvit; quod damnentur impii et quod crucientur, non est a Domino permissio qualis est volentis sed qualis est non volentis, qui non potest auxilium 
ferre, urgente et resistente fine, qui est salvatio totius generis humani, (m)nam si auxilium ferret, foret malum facere, quod prorsus contra Divinum est;(n) sed de his plura, ex Divina Domini Misericordia,
