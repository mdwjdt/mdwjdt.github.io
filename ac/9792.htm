<h3 align="center" class="ired">属天的奥秘 第9792节</h3>
<h4 align="center"></h4><p><strong>9792.</strong>我所看到的这个女人胸前披着一件宽大的衣服，能把她遮住。这衣服是这样制作的：她能把手臂插进去，把自己包裹起来，然后离开。衣服的下半部分能拉上去；当拉上去贴在身上时，它看似一件胸兜，就是我们地球上的女人所穿的那种。然而，男人也穿这样的衣服，用来遮身；我看见他从女人身上取下衣服，把它披在后背，松开下半部分，然后这衣服便直垂到脚，像一件长袍；他就这样穿着开始走动。</p>

<p align="center"><b>Potts(1905-1910) 9792</b></p><p><b>9792.</b>
The woman who was seen had a wide garment in front of her bosom, behind which she could hide herself. It was so made that she could insert her arms, and clothe herself with it, and so go away. The lower 
part of it could be drawn up; and when drawn up and applied to the body, it appeared like a stomacher, such as is worn by the women of our earth. But the same garment served the man also for a covering, 
and he was seen to take it from the woman and apply it to his own back, loosening the lower part, which then flowed down to his feet like a gown, and in this manner he walked clad. </p>

<p align="center"><b>Elliott(1983-1999) 9792</b></p><p><b>9792.</b>
The woman I saw had in front of her breast a broad garment behind which she could conceal herself. It had been made in such a way that she could insert her arms into it, wrap it around herself, and then 
move off. The lower part of it could be drawn up; and when drawn up and fitted to the body it looked like a kind of upper garment that women on our planet wear. Yet the same piece of clothing also 
served as a garment for the man. I saw him take it from the woman, fit it to his back, undo the lower part, which then flowed down to his feet like a robe, and so attired begin to walk.  </p>

</p><b>9792.</b>
Femina quae visa, ante pectus habebat latum indumentum, post quod se abscondere potuit; quod ita factum erat, ut inserere bracchia posset, ac illo se induere, et sic abire; id quoad inferiorem partem 
subduci potuit, et subductum et corpori applicatum apparuit instar pectoralis, quale feminis nostrae telluris; sed idem etiam inserviebat viro pro indumento, visum quod sumeret id a femina, et applicaret 
tergo suo, et solveret inferiorem partem, quae sic defluebat ad pedes sicut toga, et ita ambulabat vestitus. </p>
