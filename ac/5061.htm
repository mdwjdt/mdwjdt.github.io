<h3 align="center" class="ired">属天的奥秘 第5061节</h3>
<h4 align="center"></h4><p><strong>5061.</strong>最后，我补充以下值得注意的事。有些灵人被长时间地关在一个与众不同的地狱里，他们无法从中逃脱出来。我好几次想知道他们到底是谁。一天晚上，他们被放出来了，然后就听见从他们那里传来极其嘈杂的嗡嗡声，这声音持续了很长时间。当得着机会时，我能听见他们对我的嘲讽，并发觉他们渴望并努力上来毁灭我。我问天使这是为什么；他们回答说，这些灵人一生都在仇恨我，尽管我根本没有对他们作出过任何伤害。我还获知，这类灵人一察觉到他们所仇恨之人的气场，就渴望将他毁灭。但他们被带回他们自己的地狱。由此清楚可知，那些在世时彼此仇恨的人在来世相遇，并打算向彼此施加众多伤害，如我常被恩准通过其它例子所知道的。因为仇恨是爱与仁的对立面，是一种转身远离，可以说是一种属灵的厌恶。因此，在来世，这类灵人一察觉他们所仇恨之人的气场，似乎就陷入一种疯狂状态，可以说怒不可遏。由此可见主在马太福音（<a href="http://39-27.cn/太5.22.htm">5:22</a>-<a href="http://39-27.cn/太5.26.htm">26</a>）所说的话隐含什么。</p>

By way of corollary I may add this memorable circumstance. There were some spirits who had long lain concealed, shut up in a peculiar hell, from which they could not break out. I sometimes wondered who 
they were. One evening they were let out, and then was heard from them a very tumultuous noise of murmurs, which continued a long time; and when opportunity was given, I heard from them scoffings against 
me, and perceived that they desired and were endeavoring to come up and destroy me. I asked the angels the reason of this; and they said that during their lifetime these persons had hated me, although 
I had never harmed them; and I was instructed that when such spirits merely perceive the sphere of the person whom they have hated, they breathe his destruction; but they were sent back into their 
own hell. From this it is evident that those who have hated each other in the world meet in the other life, and attempt many evils against each other, as has often been granted me to know by other 
examples. For hatred is opposite to love and charity, and is an aversion, and as it were a spiritual antipathy; and therefore the moment that such spirits perceive in the other life the sphere of the 
person against whom they have borne hatred, they come as it were into a fury. It is plain from this what is involved in the Lord's words in Matthew 5:22-26. </p>

To end with let the following noteworthy incident be added. There were some spirits who lay shut up for a long time in a hell unlike any other, from which they could not break out. I wondered several 
times who exactly they might be. One evening they were let out, at which point a quite tumultuous grumbling sound was heard to be coming from them, which lasted for a long time. Having been given the 
opportunity to do so, I could hear them making jeering remarks about me, and I perceived that their desire and endeavour was to come up and destroy me. I asked the angels the reason for this. They replied 
that those spirits had hated me during their lifetime even though I had not done them any harm at all. I also learned that when spirits of this kind merely perceive the sphere of one whom they have 
hated they long for his destruction. But they were taken back to their own particular hell. From this it became clear that those who have hated one another in the world meet in the next life and set 
out to inflict many injuries on one another, as other examples of such hatred witnessed by me on a number of other occasions have also led me to know. For hatred is the opposite of love and charity, 
and is a turning away and so to speak spiritual antipathy. Consequently the moment such spirits in the next life perceive the sphere of one they have hated they go into a seeming frenzy. From this one 
may see what is implied by what the Lord has said in <a href="http://bible.gospelcom.net/cgi-bin/bible?passage=Matthew%205:22-26&amp;version=ESV&amp;interface=print&amp;showfn=yes&amp;showxref">Matthew 5:22-26</a>. </p>

</p><b>5061.</b>
Corollarii {1} loco, licet hoc memorandum adjicere: fuerunt aliqui spiritus qui latuerunt diu inclusi in peculiari inferno, e quo non potuerunt erumpere; miratus sum aliquoties quinam essent; </p>
<p>quadam 
vespera emissi sunt, et tunc audiebatur ab illis sonitus murmurum satis tumultuosus, qui perstabat diu, et cum data copia, audivi ab illis dicteria contra me, et percepi conatum quod vellent ascendere 
et me perdere; quaerebam causam ab angelis; dicebant quod illi odio me habuerint cum vixerunt, tametsi illos nihil prorsus laeseram; et instruebar quod tales cum modo percipiunt sphaeram illius 
quem odio habuerunt, perniciem ejus spirent; sed remissi sunt in infernum suum Inde constare potuit quod illi qui odio se mutuo habuerunt in mundo, in altera vita conveniant, et sibi mutuo (t)mala 
multa intentent, quod etiam ab aliis exemplis pluries scire datum est; odium enim est oppositum amori et charitati, et est aversatio et quasi antipathia spiritualis; quare ilico cum in altera 
vita percipiunt sphaeram ejus contra quem odium habuerunt, quasi in furorem veniunt.  Inde patet quid involvit quod Dominus dixit apud Matthaeum v 22-26. </p>
