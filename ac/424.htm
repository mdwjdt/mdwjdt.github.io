<h4 align="center"></h4><p><strong>424.</strong>“匠人”在圣言中表聪明智慧、有知识的人，这里的“铜铁匠人”表那些拥有属世良善与真理之人。如启示录：<br />巴比伦大城必这样猛力地被扔下去，决不能再见；琴师、乐人、笛手、号手的声音，在你中间决不能再听见。各手艺的匠人在你中间决不能再遇见。（启示录<a href="http://39-27.cn/启18.21.htm">18:21</a>-<a href="http://39-27.cn/启18.22.htm">22</a>）<br />“琴师”同上，仍表真理，“号手”表信之善。“各手艺的匠人”表拥有知识，即记忆层面的真理与良善之人。在以赛亚书：<br />偶像是匠人铸造，银匠用金包裹，为它铸造银链。 为自己寻找巧匠，立起不能摇动的偶像（以赛亚书<a href="http://39-27.cn/赛40.19.htm">40:19</a>-<a href="http://39-27.cn/赛40.20.htm">20</a>）<br />这说的是那些出于妄想为自己制造虚假，也就是“偶像”，并以貌似为真的方式教导它的人。如耶利米书：<br />他们既愚昧又迷糊；空虚的教义只是个木头；银子打成片，从他施带来，也有从乌法运来的金子；是匠人和金匠手作的产品；它们穿着蓝色和紫色的衣服；全都是巧匠的作品。（耶利米书<a href="http://39-27.cn/耶10.1.htm">10:1</a>，<a href="http://39-27.cn/耶10.8.htm">8</a>-<a href="http://39-27.cn/耶10.9.htm">9</a>）<br />这些话的意思是，教导虚假者从圣言搜集资料来捏造自己的发明，因此它称为“空虚的教义”和“巧匠的作品”。在古时，这种人以铸造偶像（即虚假）的匠人来表示，他们用金（假善）、银（假真理）、蓝衣（看似一致的属世事物）装饰这偶像（即虚假）。</p>

<p><strong>[NCE]424.</strong> An artisan in the Word symbolizes one who is wise, understanding, or knowledgeable; here, where it is an artisan in bronze or iron, it symbolizes those who know about earthly goodness and truth. In John, for example:<br />Babylon, the great city, will be overthrown with vehemence, and it will not be found any longer. And the sound of harpists and musicians and flutists and trumpeters will not be heard in it any longer. And no artisan of any art will be found in it any longer. (<a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_424/bible_king-james-version_revelation_18_21-22" target=_top>Revelation 18:21-22</a>)<br />Harpists stand for religious truth, as they did above, and trumpeters, for religious good. An artisan of any art stands for one who knows about truth and goodness or for the knowledge itself. In Isaiah:<br />The artisan casts a statue, and the metalsmith overlays it with gold and molds chains of silver. [An idolater] seeks out a wise artisan to prepare a statue, in hopes that it will not be toppled. (<a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_424/bible_king-james-version_isaiah_40_19-20" target=_top>Isaiah 40:19-20</a>)<br />The artisan stands for those who concoct falsity — the statue — for themselves out of their illusions and teach it in a way that makes it seem true. In Jeremiah:<br />While they are becoming foolish, they grow stupid. Their education in worthless things is a piece of wood. Silver beaten thin is brought from Tarshish, gold from Uphaz, the work of the artisan and of the metalsmith's hands, blue-violet fabric and clothing — all of them the work of the wise. (<a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_424/bible_king-james-version_jeremiah_10_3" target=_top>Jeremiah 10:3</a>, <a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_424/bible_king-james-version_jeremiah_10_8-9" target=_top>8-9</a>)<br />These things symbolize a person who teaches falsity and who collects scriptural passages to use in molding a fiction. This is why it is called an education in worthless things and the work of the wise. Such people were once represented by artisans who cast idols (falsities) that they embellish with gold (an imitation of good), silver (an imitation of truth), and blue-violet fabric and clothing (things on the earthly plane that seem to harmonize). </p>
<p align="center"><b>Potts(1905-1910) 424</b></p><p><b>424.</b>
By an "artificer" in the Word is signified a wise, intelligent, and well-informed [sciens] man, and here by "every artificer in brass and iron" are signified those who are acquainted with natural good 
and truth. As in John:     With violence shall that great city Babylon be thrown down, and shall be found no more at all. And the voice of harpers, and musicians, and of pipers, and trumpeters, shall 
be heard no more at all in her; and no artificer, of whatsoever craft, shall be found anymore in her (Rev. 18:21-22). "Harpers" here as above signify truths; "trumpeters" the goods of faith; an "artificer 
of any craft" one who knows, or the memory-knowledge [scientia] of truth and good. In Isaiah: </p>
<p>     The artificer melteth a graven image, and the smelter spreadeth it over with gold, and casteth 
silver chains; he seeketh unto him a wise artificer, to prepare a graven image that shall not be moved (Isa. 40:19-20), speaking of those who from phantasy forge for themselves what is false-a "graven 
image"-and teach it so that it appears true. In Jeremiah: </p>
<p>     At the same time as they are infatuated they grow foolish, the doctrine of vanities, it is but a stock. Silver beaten out is brought 
from Tarshish, and gold from Uphaz, the work of the artificer, and of the hands of the smelter; blue and raiment; they are all the work of the wise (Jer. 10:1, 8-9), signifying one who teaches falsities, 
and collects from the Word things with which to forge his invention, wherefore it is called a "doctrine of vanities" and the "work of the wise." Such persons were represented in ancient times by 
artificers who forge idols, that is, falsities, which they adorn with gold, that is, with a semblance of good; and with silver, or an appearance of truth; and with blue and with raiment, or such natural 
things as are in apparent agreement. </p>

<p align="center"><b>Elliott(1983-1999) 424</b></p><p><b>424.</b>
'A craftsman' in the Word means a person who has wisdom, intelligence, and knowledge. Here 'a craftsman in bronze and iron' means people who have a knowledge of natural good and truth. In John,  </p>
<blockquote>
Babylon 
the great city will be thrown down with violence and will be found no more; and the sound of harpers, and minstrels, and flute players, and trumpeters will be heard in you<A name="fntext1"></a><A href="#fn1"><sup>a</sup></a> no more. And every craftsman 
of every craft will be found in you<A name="fntext1"></a><A href="#fn1"><sup>a</sup></a> no more. <a href="http://bible.gospelcom.net/cgi-bin/bible?passage=Rev%2018:21,%2022&amp;version=ESV&amp;interface=print&amp;showfn=yes&amp;showxref">Rev 18:21, 22</a>.  
</blockquote>
<p>As previously, 'harpers' stands for truths, 'trumpeters' for the goods of faith. A 'craftsman of every craft' stands for one 
who has knowledge, that is, knowledge of truth and good. In Isaiah,  </p>
<blockquote>
The craftsman casts an idol, and a goldsmith overlays it with gold and casts silver chains for it. He seeks for himself a wise craftsman 
to make ready an idol, that is immovable. <a href="http://bible.gospelcom.net/cgi-bin/bible?passage=Isa%2040:19,%2020&amp;version=ESV&amp;interface=print&amp;showfn=yes&amp;showxref">Isa 40:19, 20</a>.  
</blockquote>
<p>This stands for people who fabricate falsity - an idol - for themselves out of delusions and teach it in such a way that it looks 
like truth. In Jeremiah,  </p>
<blockquote>
They are at one and the same time foolish and stupid; that wood is a way of learning vanities! Beaten silver is brought from Tarshish, gold from Uphaz; the work of the craftsman 
and of the hands of the moulder. Their clothing is violet and [purple]. These are all the work of the wise. <a href="http://bible.gospelcom.net/cgi-bin/bible?passage=Jer%2010:3,%208,%209&amp;version=ESV&amp;interface=print&amp;showfn=yes&amp;showxref">Jer 10:3, 8, 9</a>.  
</blockquote>
<p>These statements mean the person who teaches falsities and who 
compiles material from the Word to produce some figment of the imagination. This is why it is called 'a way of learning vanities' and the 'work of the wise'. In the past such people were represented as 
craftsmen fashioning idols (falsities) which they decorated with 'gold' (imitation good) and with 'silver' (imitation truth) and with 'violet and [purple] clothing' (natural things which are seemingly 
in agreement).

Per 'artificem' significatur in Verbo sapiens, intelligens: sciens; hic per 'artificem aeris et ferri' scientes boni et veri naturalis ut apud Johannem, 	Impetu dejicietur Babylon, magna urbs, et non 
invenietur amplius; et vox citharoedorum, et musicorum, et tibicinum, et buccinatorum, non audietur {1} in illa' amplius; et omnis artifex omnis artis non invenietur {1} in ea' amplius, Apoc. xviii 
21, 22; </p>
<p>'citharoedi,' ut prius, pro veris; 'buccinatores' pro bonis fidei; 'artifex omnis artis' pro sciente, seu scientia veri et boni: apud Esaiam, 	Sculptile fundit artifex, et conflator auro obducit 
illud et catenas argenti conflans,... artificem sapientem quaerit sibi ad praeparandum sculptile, ne commoveatur, xl 19, 20; </p>
<p>pro iis qui fingunt sibi falsum, quod est 'sculptile,' ex phantasia, 
e docent ut appareat sicut verum: apud Jeremiam, 	Simul cum [x] infatuantur, stultescunt, disciplina 	vanitatum lignum est; argentum extensum, ex Tarshish adfertur; aurum ex Uphaso, opus artificis et 
manuum conflatoris, hyacinthinum et [purpura] {2} vestis, opus sapientum tota, x 3, 8, 9; </p>
<p>quae significant docentem falsa, et compilantem ex Verbo quibus conflet figmentum; quare vocatur 'disciplina 
vanitatum, et sapientum opus'; hi repraesentati olim sunt per artifices qui conflant idola, se falsa, quae ornant 'auro,' hoc est, quasi bono; 'argento,' hoc est, quasi' vero; 'hyacinthino et [purpura] 
{2} vesti,' hoc est, naturalibus, quae quasi concordent. @	1 Sch. has in te, Gk. 'en soi' and so S. in A.E. and A.R.$ @	2 Elsewhere S. has purpura vestis as Heb.$ </p>
