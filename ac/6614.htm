<h3 align="center" class="ired">属天的奥秘 第6614节</h3>
<h4 align="center"></h4><p><strong>6614.</strong>我通过活生生的经历被指示天使的观念如何流入下面灵人的观念，因而进入粗鄙的观念。来自天使天堂的大量观念以可视的形式呈现为分成小朵的亮云；每一小朵都由无数观念构成，在一个灵人里面产生一个简单的观念。此后，我被指示，这样一个观念包含成千上万的事物，这些事物也通过由灵人的言语所构成的一片云来表现。后来，我与灵人谈论了这些事，说，它们可通过视觉对象来说明；因为当看似一个简单整体的物体用一个放大镜来观看时，成千上万的看不见的细节就会呈现在眼前，就像用显微镜观察那些看上去就像一个黑点的微小幼虫一样；不仅能看见它们为数众多，还能看见每一个的形状。如果用倍数更大的放大镜来检查它们，就能看见它们的器官、肢体、内脏，以及血管和纤维。思维观念也是如此，每一个都包含成千上万的事物，尽管形成一个思维的众多观念看上去只是一个简单的整体。即便如此，构成一个思维的观念所能包含的事物比构成另一个思维的观念所包含的更多。它包含多少取决于它向周围社群的传播或延伸。</p>

It has been shown by living experience how angelic ideas flow into the ideas of spirits who are beneath, and therefore in grosser ideas. An abundance of ideas from the angelic heaven was shown as a bright 
cloud divided into little masses; each little mass, which consisted of countless ideas, produced in a spirit one simple idea; and it was afterward shown that thousands and thousands of things were 
in it, which were also represented by a cloud before the eyes of spirits. I afterward spoke of these things with the spirits, showing that they may be illustrated by the objects of sight; for an object 
which appears simple, when seen through a magnifying glass, immediately presents to the sight a thousand things not before visible; as in the case of animalcules which appear as one obscure object, 
but when viewed in a microscope not only become many, but each is seen in its form; and if subjected to still higher power of sight, there are seen organs, members, viscera, and also vessels and fibers. 
Such also is the case with the ideas of thought, thousands and thousands of things being in each of them, although the many ideas together of which the thought is composed, appear only as a simple 
thing. Nevertheless there are more things in the ideas of thought of one person than in the ideas of another, the abundance of ideas in the thought being according to the extension into societies. </p>

I have been shown by actual experience how angelic ideas flow into the ideas of the spirits who are beneath them, therefore into ideas that are grosser. An abundance of ideas from the angelic heaven 
presented themselves visually as a shining white cloud that could be distinguished into separate little tufts; and each little tuft, which consisted of countless strands, presented a spirit with one simple 
idea. After that I was shown that such an idea contained thousands and thousands of strands, which were also represented by means of a cloud composed of the spirits' speech. After this I spoke to 
the spirits on these matters, saying that the objects of sight can be used by way of illustration. When an object which looks like a simple whole is examined with an optical device thousands of unseen 
details present themselves to view, as when tiny grubs which look like one dark blob are examined with a microscope; not only the multiplicity of them is seen but also the shape of each one. If even 
greater magnification is used to examine them, their organs, members, viscera, and vessels and fibres too can be seen. So also with the ideas constituting thought. Each one has thousands and thousands 
of strands to it; yet a number of ideas together from which a thought is formed are seen merely as a simple whole. Even so, the ideas that constitute one thought can contain more than the ideas constituting 
another. How much it contains is determined by its spread into communities round about. </p>

Ostensum est per vivam experientiam quomodo ideae angelicae influunt in ideas spirituum qui infra sunt, ac ideo in crassioribus ideis; idearum copia ex caelo angelico sistebatur visibilis sicut nubes 
candida distincta in moleculas, unaquaevis molecula, quae constabat ex innumerabilibus, producebat unam simplicem ideam apud spiritum; et dein ostensum quod millia et millia inessent quae quoque per 
nubem loquelae spirituum repraesentata sunt.  {1} De his locutus dein sum cum spiritibus, quod illustrari queant illa per objecta visus, unum objectum, {2}quod apparet simplex, cum inspicitur vitro optico, 
tunc {3}sistuntur videnda millia non visa, sicut vermiculi minores qui apparent sicut unum obscurum, inspecti microscopio non solum plures sunt sed quisque in forma; quae si adhuc subtiliore {4}visu 
inspicitur, videntur organa, membra, viscera et quoque vasa (c)et fibrae; ita quoque se habet cum ideis cogitationis; unicuique millia et millia insunt, tametsi plures ideae simul, ex quibus cogitatio, 
modo sicut simplex {5}apparet.  Sed usque unius cogitationis ideis plura insunt quam ideis alterius; copia quae inest, se habet secundum extensionem in societates. @1 i cum ita se habent ideae 
cogitationis apud spiritus, quid non apud hominem?$ @2 cum putatur$ @3 apparent$ @4 vitro$ @5 appareant$ </p>
