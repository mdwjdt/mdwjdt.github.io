<h3 align="center" class="ired">属天的奥秘 第4497节</h3>
<h4 align="center"></h4><p><strong>4497.</strong>“雅各的两个儿子，就是西缅和利未”表信与爱。这从“西缅”和“利未”的代表清楚可知：“西缅”是指意愿中的信（参看<a href="3869.htm">3869</a>-<a href="3872.htm">3872</a>节）；“利未”是指属灵之爱或仁爱（<a href="3875.htm">3875</a>，<a href="3877.htm">3877</a>节）。这些就是“西缅和利未”，以及按他们的名字所命名的支派真正意义上所表示的事物。但在反面意义上，他们则表示虚假与邪恶，因为虚假是信之真理的反面，邪恶是仁之良善的反面。这些就是在犹太民族灭绝了自己里面诸如构成敬拜内在的信与仁的一切事物背景下，西缅和利未所代表的事物。这一点从接下来的内容看得更清楚，那里论到他们说：他们杀了哈抹、示剑和城中的男丁；并且雅各的儿子们来到被杀的人那里，把一切都掳掠去了。犯下这种罪行的，之所以是西缅和利未，是因为他们代表以下事实：信之真理和仁之良善已变成虚假和邪恶；因为当在教会中，真理变成虚假，良善变成邪恶时，这个教会就完了。</p>

That the two sons of Jacob, Simeon and Levi. That this signifies faith and love, is evident from the representation of Simeon, as being faith in the will (see n. 3869-3872), and from the representation 
of Levi, as being spiritual love or charity (n. 3875, 3877). This is the signification in the genuine sense of "Simeon and Levi" and of the tribes called after them, but in the opposite sense they 
signify what is false and evil, for falsity is opposite to the truth of faith, and evil to the good of charity. Such is the representation of Simeon and Levi with respect to the Jewish nation, which had 
extinguished in itself everything of faith and charity (which were the internals of worship), as may better appear from what follows, where it is said of them that they killed Hamor, Shechem, and the 
men of the city; and that the sons of Jacob came upon those who were pierced, and made a prey of all things. The reason why it was Simeon and Levi who did this, was to represent the fact that the truth 
of faith and the good of charity had become falsity and evil; for when in the church truth becomes falsity and good becomes evil it is all over with the church. </p>

'That two of Jacob's sons, Simeon and Levi' means faith and love. This is clear from the representation of 'Simeon' as faith in the will, dealt with in <a href="3869.htm">3869</a>-<a href="3872.htm">3872</a>, and from the representation of 'Levi' 
as spiritual love or charity, dealt with in <a href="3875.htm">3875</a>, <a href="3877.htm">3877</a>. These are the things meant in the genuine sense by Simeon and Levi and also by the tribes named after Simeon and Levi. But in the contrary sense 
falsity and evil are meant, for falsity is the contrary of the truth of faith, and evil the contrary of the good of charity. These are the things that Simeon and Levi represent when the context is 
the Jewish nation which had annihilated among themselves everything of faith and everything of charity, such as constitute the internal aspects of worship. This becomes much clearer in what follows where 
it is said that they killed Hamor, Shechem, and the men of the city, and that the sons of Jacob came upon the slain and plundered everything. Simeon and Levi were the ones to commit this deed, so 
as to represent the fact that the truth of faith and the good of charity had been made into falsity and evil. For when truth becomes falsity and good becomes evil within the Church, the Church is done for. </p>

`Et acceperunt duo filii Jacobi Shimeon et Levi': quod significet fidem et amorem, constat a repraesentatione `Shimeonis' quod sit fides voluntate, de qua n. 3869-3872, et ex repraesentatione `Levi' 
quod sit amor spiritualis seu charitas, de qua n. 3875, 3877; in genuino sensu illa per Shimeonem et Levi et quoque per tribus a Shimeone et Levi nominatas significantur, at in sensu opposito falsum 
et malum, nam falsum est oppositum vero fidei, et malum bono charitatis; haec repraesentant Shimeon et Levi respective ad gentem Judaicam quae apud se exstinxerat omne fidei et omne charitatis 
quae erant interna cultus; ut melius constare potest a sequentibus, ubi de illis dicitur quod `occiderint Hamorem, Shechemum {1}, (c)et viros urbis,' et quod `filii Jacobi venerint super confossos 
et depraedati sint omnia.' Quod Shimeon et Levi id fecerint, erat ut repraesentaretur quod verum quod fidei et bonum quod charitatis, factum sit falsum et malum; cum enim verum fit falsum et bonum 
fit malum in Ecclesia, actum est de Ecclesia.      @1 i et$ </p>
