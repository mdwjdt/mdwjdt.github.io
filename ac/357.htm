<h4 align="center"></h4><p><strong>357.</strong>“该隐被大大地激怒”表仁已丧失，这一点从随后他杀了他兄弟亚伯一事明显可知，亚伯表仁。愤怒是一种普遍情感，起因于反对我爱及其私欲的任何事。在恶灵界，可明显感受到这种情绪，那里普遍存在着对主的忿怒，因为恶灵没有仁，只有恨，但凡不顺从他们的我爱和对尘世之爱，就会激起对立情绪，即表现为愤怒。在圣言中，“怒气”、“忿怒”、“烈怒”等经常被认为是耶和华所为，其实它们出于人，被归于耶和华，是因为它表面看上去是这样。诗篇这样写到：<br />“祂使猛烈的怒气、忿怒、愤恨、患难，好像一群降灾的使者，临到他们中间。祂为自己的怒气修平了路，不惜使他们死亡。”（诗篇<a href="http://39-27.cn/诗78.49.htm">78:49</a>-<a href="http://39-27.cn/诗78.50.htm">50</a>）<br />耶和华从不降怒于任何人，而是人自招忿怒。也未曾如经上所说，差遣降灾的使者，而是人自己招来的。为此，经上又补充说，“祂为自己的怒气修平了路，不惜使他们死亡”，以赛亚书上说：“人都必归向祂，凡向祂发怒的必至蒙羞。”（以赛亚书<a href="http://39-27.cn/赛45.24.htm">45:24</a>）<br />从引用的这些经文清楚可知，“怒”表邪恶，或也可说，背离仁。</p>

<p><strong>[NCE]357.</strong> The symbolism of the anger kindled in Cain as the departure of charity is evident from the sequel — that he killed his brother Abel, who symbolizes charity.<br />Anger is a generalized emotion — our reaction to everything that stands in the way of self-love and the desires that go along with it. This can be clearly perceived in the realm of evil spirits, where anger directed at the Lord is pervasive, because the inhabitants have no charity but only hatred. Whatever does not favor self-love and materialism arouses opposition, which displays itself in anger.<br />The Word many times attributes anger, wrath, and even fury to Jehovah. But these emotions are ours and are blamed on Jehovah merely because they seem to be his, for the reason just mentioned. So David says:<br />He sent against them the anger of his nostril, and wrath, and fury, and anguish, and a delegation of evil angels. He leveled out a path for anger; he did not withhold their soul from death. (<a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_357/bible_king-james-version_psalms_78_49-50" target=_top>Psalms 78:49-50</a>)<br />It is not that Jehovah ever sends anger against anyone but that people bring it into themselves. Neither is it he that sends evil angels, as it says, but we that invite them to come. Consequently it adds that he levels out the path of anger and does not withhold their soul from death. Isaiah accordingly says:<br />They will come to Jehovah, and all who blazed up against him will be shamed. (<a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_357/bible_king-james-version_isaiah_45_24" target=_top>Isaiah 45:24</a>)<br />This shows that anger symbolizes evil or, what is the same thing, a departure from charity. </p>
<p align="center"><b>Potts(1905-1910) 357</b></p><p><b>357.</b>
That "Cain's anger was kindled" signifies that charity had departed, is evident from what is afterwards related of his killing his brother Abel, by whom is signified charity. Anger is a general affection 
resulting from whatever is opposed to self-love and its cupidities. This is plainly perceived in the world of evil spirits, for there exists there a general anger against the Lord, in consequence 
of evil spirits being in no charity, but in hatred, and whatever does not favor self-love [amori proprio] and the love of the world, excites opposition, which is manifested by anger. In the Word, "anger" 
"wrath" and even "fury" are frequently predicated of Jehovah, but they are of man, and are attributed to Jehovah because it so appears, for a reason mentioned above. Thus it is written in David: </p>
<p> 
    He sent against them the anger of His nostril, and wrath, and fury, and trouble, and an immission of evil angels; He hath weighed a path for His anger, He withheld not their soul from death (Ps. 
78:49-50). Not that Jehovah ever sends anger upon anyone, but that men bring it upon themselves; nor does He send evil angels among them, but man draws them to himself. And therefore it is added, that 
He "hath weighed a path for His anger, and withheld not their soul from death;" and therefore it is said in Isaiah, "To Jehovah shall he come, and all that were incensed against Him shall be ashamed" 
(Isa. 45:24), whence it is evident that "anger" signifies evils, or what is the same, a departure from charity. </p>

<p align="center"><b>Elliott(1983-1999) 357</b></p><p><b>357.</b>
'Cain's anger was set ablaze' means that charity had departed. This becomes clear from what comes further on, where it is said that he killed Abel his brother, who means charity. Anger is the general 
emotion that results from anything which gets in the way of self-love and its desires In the world of evil spirits this is perceived plainly. Indeed general anger against the Lord prevails, because they 
are not moved at all by charity, but only by hatred. Anything that is unfavourable to self-love and the love of the world arouses opposition, which manifests itself in anger. In the Word, anger, wrath, 
and even rage, are frequently attributed to Jehovah; but in fact they belong to man and are attributed to Jehovah because they seem to be from Him, for reasons mentioned already. The following is 
stated in David,  </p>
<blockquote>
He let loose on them His fierce anger and wrath, and rage, and distress, and a mission of evil angels. He levelled out a path for His anger, He did not spare their soul from death. 
<a href="http://bible.gospelcom.net/cgi-bin/bible?passage=Ps%2078:49,%2050&amp;version=ESV&amp;interface=print&amp;showfn=yes&amp;showxref">Ps 78:49, 50</a>.   
</blockquote>
Not that Jehovah ever 'lets loose His anger on anyone', but that people bring it down on themselves. Nor, as it is said, does He send evil angels but man takes them to himself. 
This is why the statement is added that 'He levels out a path for His anger and does not spare their soul from death', and it is said in Isaiah that   He will come to Jehovah, and all will be ashamed 
who were incensed against <a href="http://bible.gospelcom.net/cgi-bin/bible?passage=Isa%2045:14&amp;version=ESV&amp;interface=print&amp;showfn=yes&amp;showxref">Isa 45:14</a>.  </p>
<p>From these quotations it is clear that 'anger' means evils, or what amounts to the same, a departure from charity.  </p>

</p><b>357.</b>
Quod per 'iram accensam Caino' significetur quod recesserit charitas, constare potest a sequentibus, quod 'occiderit Habelem fratrem,' per quem significatur charitas. Ira est affectio communis resultans 
ex omni quod contrariatur amori proprio et ejus cupiditatibus. In mundo spirituum malorum hoc manifeste percipitur, est enim ira communis contra Dominum, quia in nulla charitate sunt sed in odiis; 
quodcumque non favet amori proprio et mundi, hoc excitat contrarietatem, quae manifestatur per iram.  De Jehovah in Verbo multoties praedicatur ira, excandescentia, ut et furor; sed sunt hominis, et 
tribuitur Jehovae quia ita apparet; et ex causa de qua prius; ita apud Davidem, 	Misit in eos iram naris suae, et excandescentiam, et 	furorem, et angustiam, et immissionem angelorum malorum; libravit 
semitam irae, non prohibuit a morte animam eorum, Ps. lxxviii 49 [50]; </p>
<p>non quod Jehovah usquam 'mittat in aliquem iram,' sed quod ii semetipsis; nec angelos malos, ut dicitur, sed quod homo eos adsciscat; 
ideo additur quod 'libret semitam irae, et non prohibeat a morte animam eorum'; quare apud Esaiam, 	Ad Jehovam veniet, et pudefient omnes, qui excanduerunt contra Ipsum, xlv 24; </p>
<p>inde constat 
quod 'ira' significet mala, seu quod idem est, recessionem a charitate. </p>
