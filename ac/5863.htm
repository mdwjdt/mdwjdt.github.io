<h3 align="center" class="ired">属天的奥秘 第5863节</h3>
<h4 align="center"></h4><p><strong>5863.</strong>恶灵若真的发觉他们与人同在，他们是与他分离的灵人，并且能直接影响他的身体功能，就会千方百计地毁灭他，因为他们对他怀有致命的仇恨。因知道我是一个尚在肉体中的人，于是他们不断试图毁灭我，不仅毁灭我的肉体，尤其毁灭我的灵魂；因为对地狱里的所有人来说，毁灭人或任何灵人是生命的最大乐趣。但主不断保护我，使我免受毁灭。由此明显可知，对人来说，与灵人直接接触何等危险，除非他处于信之良善。</p>

<p align="center"><b>Potts(1905-1910) 5863</b></p><p><b>5863.</b>
If evil spirits perceived that they are with man, and that they are spirits separate from him, and if they could flow into what is of his body, they would try to destroy him in a thousand ways, for they 
hold man in deadly hatred. And as they knew that I was a man in the body, they were in a continual effort to destroy me, not only as to the body, but especially as to the soul; for to destroy man 
and any spirit is the very delight of life of all those who are in hell; but I have been continually protected by the Lord. From this it is evident how dangerous it is for man to be in living company 
with spirits, unless he is in the good of faith. </p>

<p align="center"><b>Elliott(1983-1999) 5863</b></p><p><b>5863.</b>
If evil spirits were to perceive their own presence with a person and their own separateness as spirits from him, and if they were able to exert a direct influence on the functions of the person's body, 
they would try in a thousand ways to destroy him, since they harbour a murderous hatred of him. Knowing that I was a person still in my body they were constantly trying to destroy me, not only in 
body but above all in soul; for the destruction of man, or of any spirit, is the greatest pleasure in life for all in hell. But the Lord constantly kept me safe from destruction. This shows how dangerous 
it is for a person to be in direct contact with spirits unless he is governed by the good of faith.  </p>

<p align="center"><b>Latin(1748-1756) 5863</b>
</p><b>5863.</b>
Si mali spiritus perciperent quod apud hominem essent et quod separati spiritus ab illo, sique influere potuissent in illa quae ejus corporis sunt, conarentur illum mille modis perdere, nam odio internecino 
habent hominem; et quia sciverunt quod ego homo in corpore essem, ideo in continuo conatu fuerunt me perdendi, non solum quoad corpus sed imprimis quoad animam; perdere enim hominem et aliquem 
spiritum, est ipsum jucundum vitae omnium illorum qui in inferno sunt; sed continue tutatus sum a Domino. Inde constare potest quam periculosum sit {1}homini, ut in vivo consortio sit cum spiritibus, 
nisi sit in bono fidei. @1 ut aperiantur interiora hominis$ </p>
