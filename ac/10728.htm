<h3 align="center" class="ired">属天的奥秘 第10728节</h3>
<h4 align="center"></h4><p><strong>10728</strong>.“对他们说，这些是耶和华所吩咐的话，要遵行它们”表关于教会的主要真理的指示，其它一切真理都与这些真理有关。这从“说”和“耶和华所吩咐的话，要遵行它们”的含义清楚可知：“说”是指指示（参看<a href="10280.htm">10280</a>节提到的地方）；“耶和华所吩咐的话，要遵行它们”是指必须要完全遵守的主要真理。之所以表示这一点，是因为这些话是指着安息日说的，安息日是最主要的代表，因而表示主要真理，其它一切真理都与这些真理有关；因为以色列民族当中的教会代表是在秩序的最末和最低层上的真理。代表的情况是这样：出现在自然界三个王国中的一切事物构成神性秩序的最末和最低层；因为被称为属灵和属天的天堂的一切事物终止于它们。这就是为什么一个代表性教会被建立，又为什么经上吩咐诸如在最末和最低层、完全代表天堂，以及那里的各种真理和良善的那类事物。具有代表性的事物是由诸如存在于自然界中的那类物体形成的，如：周围有幔子的会幕，会幕中上面摆放陈设饼或脸饼的桌子，灯台及其灯盏，香坛，亚伦的衣服和由宝石构成的胸牌，以及其它物体。前文已经说明这类事物代表什么。</p>

And said unto them, These are the words which Jehovah hath commanded, to do them. That this signifies instruction concerning the primary thing of the church, to which all things bear relation, is evident 
from the signification of "saying," as being instruction (of which at the places cited in n. 10280); and from the signification of "the words which Jehovah hath commanded, to do them," as being the 
primary truth which was by all means to be observed. This is signified because these things are said of the Sabbath, which was the primary representative of all, thus the primary truth to which all 
things bear relation. For the representatives of the church among the Israelitish nation were truths in the ultimate of order. The case with representatives is this. All things that appear in the three 
kingdoms of nature are ultimates of Divine order, because in these close all the things of heaven, which are called spiritual and celestial. Hence a representative church was instituted, and such things 
were commanded as, in ultimates, completely represented heaven, together with all the truths and goods there; and the things that represented were the forms of such things as are in nature; as the 
Tabernacle encompassed with curtains, the table therein on which were the breads of faces, the lampstand with the lamps, the altar on which incense was offered, the garments of Aaron together with 
the breastplate of precious stones, besides other things. What such things represented has been shown in what goes before. </p>

'And said to them, These are the words which Jehovah has commanded, to do them' means instruction regarding the major truth of the Church to which all others look back. This is clear from the meaning 
of 'saying' as instruction, dealt with in the places referred to in <a href="10280.htm">10280</a>; and from the meaning of 'the words which Jehovah has commanded, to do them' as the major truth that must be fully obeyed. The 
reason why this is meant is that those words refer to the sabbath, which was the chief of all representative signs, and so means the major truth to which all others look back; for the representative 
signs in the Church among the Israelite nation were forms of truth on the last and lowest level of order. The situation with representative signs is that the objects which appear in the natural world, 
in its three kingdoms, compose the last and lowest level of Divine order; for all the realities of heaven, which are called spiritual and celestial, terminate in them. In all this lies the reason why 
a representative Church was established and why such things were commanded as would represent heaven fully, with every kind of truth and good existing there, on last and lowest levels. And the things 
which carried the representation were formed out of such objects as exist in the natural world - the tabernacle surrounded with curtains, the table in it on which the loaves of the Presence were laid, 
the lampstand and its lamps, the altar on which incense was offered, Aaron's garments and the breastplate consisting of precious stones, and other objects in addition to these. What such things represented 
has been shown in what has gone before.  </p>

`Et dixit ad illos, Haec verba quae praecepit Jehovah ad faciendum ea': quod significet instructionem de primario Ecclesiae ad quod omnia se referunt, constat ex significatione `dicere' quod (x)sit 
instructio, de qua in locis citatis n. (x)10,280, et ex significatione `verborum quae praecepit Jehovah ad faciendum' quod sit primarium verum quod omnino observandum; quod hoc significetur, est quia 
illa dicuntur de sabbato, quod omnium primarium repraesentativum erat, ita primarium verum ad quod omnia se referunt; nam repraesentativa Ecclesiae apud gentem Israeliticam fuerunt vera in ultimo ordinis; 
cum repraesentativis enim ita se habet: quae in natura apparent, in triplici ejus regno, sunt ultima ordinis Divini, terminantur enim in illis omnia caeli, quae spiritualia et caelestia vocantur; 
inde est quod Ecclesia repraesentativa instituta fuerit, ac talia mandata quae in ultimis prorsus repraesentarent caelum cum omnibus veris et bonis ibi,et quae repraesentabant erant formae ex talibus 
quae in natura, sicut tabernaculum cortinis circumductum, mensa inibi super qua panes facierum, candelabrum cum lucernis, altare super quo suffitus fiebant, {1} vestes Aharonis cum pectorali ex lapidibus 
pretiosis, praeter alia; quid talia repraesentaverunt in praecendentibus ostensum est. @1 i et$ </p>
