<h3 align="center" class="ired">属天的奥秘 第6107节</h3>
<h4 align="center"></h4><p><strong>6107.</strong>“都是照小孩子的口”表各自照着纯真良善的性质。这从“照口”和“小孩子”的含义清楚可知：“照口”是指各自并照着性质；“小孩子”是指纯真的良善（参看<a href="430.htm">430</a>，<a href="2126.htm">2126</a>，<a href="3183.htm">3183</a>，<a href="5608.htm">5608</a>节）。至于从内在属天层而来、照着纯真良善的性质进入属灵良善和属世层中教会真理的流注，情况是这样：纯真就是那从至内层赋予仁与爱的一切良善性质的。因为主通过纯真流入仁爱；所存在的纯真的量决定了所领受的仁爱的量，因为纯真是仁爱的真正本质（<a href="2780.htm">2780</a>，<a href="3111.htm">3111</a>，<a href="3183.htm">3183</a>，<a href="3994.htm">3994</a>，<a href="4797.htm">4797</a>，<a href="6013.htm">6013</a>节）。<br />纯真的性质可从小孩子，如同透过一面镜子般看出来。因为他们爱自己的父母，唯独信任他们，除了讨好父母外，什么也不关心；因此，衣食对他们来说，不仅是他们所需的东西，还是快乐的源头。他们因爱自己的父母，所以会怀着情感和快乐去做凡父母所赞成的事，因而不仅去做父母吩咐的事，还去做他们以为父母想吩咐的事。此外，他们也不关心自己；更不用说小孩子的其它许多特征了。不过，要知道，小孩子的纯真不是真正的纯真，只是它的表象。真正的纯真只存在于智慧之中（<a href="2305.htm">2305</a>，<a href="2306.htm">2306</a>，<a href="3494.htm">3494</a>，<a href="4797.htm">4797</a>节）；智慧就在于出于爱与信的良善，像刚才所说的小孩子对待自己的父母那样对待主。</p>

According to the mouth of the babe. That this signifies each according to the quality of the good of innocence, is evident from the signification of "according to the mouth," as being each, and according 
to quality; and from the signification of "babe," as being the good of innocence (see n. 430, 2126, 3183, 5608). In regard to influx from the internal celestial into spiritual good and into the truths 
of the church in the natural according to the quality of the good of innocence, the case is this. Innocence is that from the inmost which qualifies all the good of charity and of love. For the Lord 
flows in through innocence into charity, and in proportion to the innocence, such is the reception of charity; for innocence is the very essential of charity (n. 2780, 3111, 3183, 3994, 4797, 6013). 
The nature of innocence may be seen as in a mirror from little children, in that they love their parents and trust in them alone, having no care but to please them; and accordingly they have food and 
clothing not merely for their needs, but also for their delight; and as they love their parents, they do with the delight of affection whatever is agreeable to them, thus not only what they command, 
but also what they suppose them to wish to command, and moreover have no self-regard whatever; not to mention many other characteristics of infancy. But be it known that the innocence of little children 
is not innocence, but only its semblance. Real innocence dwells solely in wisdom (n. 2305, 2306, 3494, 4797), and wisdom consists in bearing oneself toward the Lord, from the good of love and of 
faith, as do little children toward their parents in the way just stated. </p>

'According to the mouth of a young child' means each one in keeping with the essential nature of the good of innocence. This is clear from the meaning of 'according to the mouth' as each one and in keeping 
with the essential nature; and from the meaning of 'a young child' as the good of innocence, dealt with in <a href="430.htm">430</a>, <a href="2126.htm">2126</a>, <a href="3183.htm">3183</a>, <a href="5608.htm">5608</a>. What the description 'influx from the internal celestial into spiritual 
good and the Church's truths within the natural in keeping with the essential nature of the good of innocence' really means is this: Innocence is what gives all the good of charity and love its 
essential nature from deep within. For the Lord flows by means of innocence into charity; and the amount of innocence present determines the amount of charity received, since innocence is the very 
essence of charity, <a href="2780.htm">2780</a>, <a href="3111.htm">3111</a>, <a href="3183.htm">3183</a>, <a href="3994.htm">3994</a>, <a href="4797.htm">4797</a>, <a href="6013.htm">6013</a>. </p>

 What innocence is like is mirrored by young children. That is to say, one can see what it is like in the way they love their parents and 
trust only them, also in their lack of all concern except to please their parents, so that food and clothing are to them not only something they need but also a source of delight. Because they love their 
parents they do with affection and delight whatever their parents approve of, thus not only what their parents command but also what they think they wish to command. In addition they have no regard 
for themselves, besides having many other characteristics. But it should be recognized that the innocence of young children is not really innocence, only a semblance of it. Real innocence resides solely 
in wisdom, see <a href="2305.htm">2305</a>, <a href="2306.htm">2306</a>, <a href="3494.htm">3494</a>, <a href="4797.htm">4797</a>; and wisdom consists in behaving towards the Lord in the ways, as have just been described, that young children do towards their parents, yet with the good of 
love and faith as the motivation. </p>

</p><b>6107.</b>
`Ad os infantis': quod significet unumquodvis secundum quale boni innocentiae, constat ex significatione `ad os' quod sit unumquodvis et secundum quale; et ex significatione `infantis' quod sit bonum 
innocentiae, de qua n. 430, 2126, 3183, 5608.  Cum hoc quod influxus a caelesti interno in bonum spirituale et in vera Ecclesiae in naturali secundum quale boni innocentiae, ita, se habet: innocentia 
est quae ab intimo qualificat omne bonum charitatis et amoris; influit enim Dominus per innocentiam in charitatem, et quantum innocentiae est tantum charitatis recipitur, est enim innocentia ipsum essentiale 
charitatis, n. 2780, 3111, 3183, 3994, 4797, 6013.  [2] Quid innocentia, videri potest sicut in speculo ab infantibus, quod nempe ament parentes suos et eis solis fidant, nec illis sollicitudo 
nisi ut parentibus placeant,  ita eis victus et amictus non modo ad necessitatem sed etiam ad delectationem; et quia amant parentes, faciunt ex jucundo affectionis quicquid illis favet, ita, non modo 
quod praecipiunt sed etiam quod praecipere velle autumant; et praeterea se nihil intuentur; praeter plura alia; sed sciendum quod innocentia infantum non sit innocentia sed modo simulacrum ejus; ipsa 
innocentia habitat solum in sapientia, videatur n. 2305, 2306, (x)3494, 4797; et sapientia est ita se gerere erga Dominum sicut dictum de infantibus erga parentes, ex bono amoris et fidei. </p>
