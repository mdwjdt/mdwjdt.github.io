<h3 align="center" class="ired">属天的奥秘 第641节</h3>
<h4 align="center"></h4><p><strong>641.</strong>要改造该教会成员的意愿，必须事先改造他的觉知。因此，这里描述了属意愿之物如何与属觉知之物分离，以及意愿如何仿佛被覆盖和保留起来，以免有东西触及它。因为若属意愿，即恶欲之物被激活，他必要灭亡，蒙主慈悲，这在以后会予以澄清。对人而言，没有什么比这两个部分，即意愿与觉知更明显有别、彼此分离的了。我尤其通过以下事实清楚得知这一点：在精灵与天使中，觉知之物流入头部或大脑左侧，而意愿之物则流入大脑右侧。脸部的情形也一样。当天使灵流入时，它们象温柔的微风一样柔和；而当恶灵流入时，则象一场洪流，它裹挟着可怖的幻相和信念流入大脑左侧，裹挟着私欲流入大脑右侧，它们的流注可以说是一场幻相和私欲的洪水。</p>

<p><strong>[NCE]641.</strong> The people of this church had to reform. The side of a person called the intellect had to reform first, before it was possible for the other side, referred to as the will, to do the same. So the present passage tells how the contents of the will were separated from those of the intellect and how they were concealed and stored away, so to speak, in order to block off any stimulus to the will. Had the appetites of the will been stirred up, it would have destroyed people, as will become clear from later explanations [<a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_641/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_660" target=_top>660-661</a>, <a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_641/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_751" target=_top>751</a>, <a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_641/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_760" target=_top>760</a>, <a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_641/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_927" target=_top>927</a>], with the Lord's divine mercy.<br />These two sides, the intellect and will, are as clearly distinguished in us as they could possibly be. I was able to learn this unmistakably from the fact that intellectual information coming from spirits and angels enters the left side of the head or brain but impulses of the will enter the right side.{*1} They affect the face in a similar way. When angelic spirits exert an influence, they waft in like the gentlest possible breezes. When evil spirits arrive, they essentially flood the left side of the brain with dreadful hallucinations and delusions and the right side with cravings. Their influence is like a deluge of fantasies and appetites.<br /><br /><strong>Footnotes:</strong><br />{*1} Swedenborg was not the first thinker to localize mental functions in different parts of the brain. Attempts were made in this direction as early as the medieval era, when mental function was frequently said (for example) to be centered in the brain's ventricles (Gaukroger 1995, 278). Swedenborg himself, in The Soul's Domain, suggested that the cerebrum is the residence of the will, while the cerebellum is the residence of "nature," that is, involuntary or autonomic processes (Swedenborg [1744-1745] 1960, <a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_641/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_394" target=_top>394</a> note m). But Swedenborg does in this and similar passages (for example, <a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_641/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_3884" target=_top>Secrets of Heaven 3884</a>, <a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_641/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_4052" target=_top>4052</a>) appear to have anticipated modern brain research by assigning different functions to the left and right hemispheres of the brain. See <a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_641/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_644" target=_top>644</a>. For Swedenborg's manuscripts on the cerebrum, unpublished during his lifetime, see Swedenborg 1976d; other earlier discussions of brain form and function can be found in Dynamics of the Soul's Domain (Swedenborg [1740-1741] 1955) and Draft on the Fiber (Swedenborg 1976a).

As this man of the church must be reformed as to that part of man which is called the understanding, before he could be reformed as to the other part which is called the will, it is here described how 
the things of the will were separated from those of the understanding, and were as it were covered over and reserved, lest anything should touch the will. For if things of the will, that is of cupidity, 
had been excited, the man would have perished, as will appear, of the Lord's Divine mercy, hereafter. These two parts-the will and the understanding-are so distinct in man that nothing could be more 
distinct, as has been given me also to know with certainty from the fact that things of the understanding of spirits and angels flow into the left part of the head or brain, and things of the will 
into the right; and it is the same with respect to the face. When angelic spirits flow in, they do so gently like the softest breaths of air; but when evil spirits flow in, it is like an inundation into 
the left part of the brain with dreadful phantasies and persuasions, and into the right with cupidities, their influx being as it were an inundation of phantasies and cupidities. </p>

<p align="center"><b>Elliott(1983-1999) 641</b></p><p><b>641.</b>
Since this member of the Church needed to be reformed as to that part of the man which is called the understanding before he could be reformed as to the other part referred to as the will, it is described 
here how those things belonging to the will were separated from those belonging to the understanding, and how the will was so to speak protected and held back to prevent anything coming in contact 
with it. For if things belonging to the will, that is, to evil desires, had been aroused, he would have perished, as in the Lord's Divine mercy will be made clear later on. With man nothing could be 
more distinct and separate one from the other than those two parts, the will and the understanding. This I have been given to know plainly, especially from the fact that among spirits and angels things 
of the understanding flow into the left side of the head or brain, while things of the will flow into the right. The same applies to the face. When angelic spirits flow in they do so as softly as 
gentlest breezes. But when evil spirits do so it is like a deluge entering with dreadful delusions and persuasions into the left side of the brain, and with desires into the right. The influx of them 
is so to speak a deluge of delusions and desires. </p>

Quia hic homo Ecclesiae reformandus esset quoad illam partem hominis quae intellectus vocatur, prius quam reformari posset quoad alteram quae voluntas appellatur, hic describitur quomodo illa quae sunt 
voluntatis separata sint ab illis quae sunt intellectus, et quasi contecta et reservata, ne quicquam eam tangeret; nam si excitarentur ea quae voluntatis, hoc est, quae cupiditatis essent, periisset; 
ut, ex Divina Domini Misericordia, in sequentibus constabit.  Binae illae partes, intellectus et voluntas, ita distinctae sunt apud hominem ut nihil distinctius, quod mihi manifeste scire datum, etiam 
per id quod intellectualia spirituum et angelorum influant in sinistram partem capitis seu cerebri, at voluntaria in dextram, similiter quoad faciem; cum angelici spiritus influunt, tunc molliter 
sicut lenissimae aurae influunt; at cum spiritus mali, tunc est quasi inundatio, in sinistram cerebri partem cum phantasiis et persuasionibus diris, in dextram cum cupiditatibus; influxus eorum est quasi 
inundatio phantasiarum et cupiditatum. </p>
