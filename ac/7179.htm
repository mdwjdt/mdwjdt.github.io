<h3 align="center" class="ired">属天的奥秘 第7179节</h3>
<h4 align="center"></h4><p><strong>7179.</strong>人里面有两种官能，一种被称为理解力，另一种被称为意愿。意愿被赋予人是为了爱之良善，理解力被赋予人是为了信之真理；因为爱之良善附着在意愿上，而信之真理则附着在理解力上；这两种官能以一种神奇的方式互相交流。它们在那些处于良善，并由此处于真理的人里面联结在一起；它们在那些陷入邪恶，并由此陷入虚假的人里面也联结在一起；对这两种人来说，这两种官能构成一个心智。但对那些在信仰上处于真理，在生活上陷入邪恶的人，以及那些在信仰上陷入邪恶，在生活上处于貌似良善的人来说，情况就不同了。</p>

<p align="center"><b>Potts(1905-1910) 7179</b></p><p><b>7179.</b>
There are two faculties in man, one is called the understanding, and the other the will; the will has been given man for the sake of the good which is of love, and the understanding for the sake of the 
truth which is of faith; for the good which is of love has relation to the will, and the truth which is of faith has relation to the understanding; the one faculty communicates in a wonderful way with 
the other. They join themselves together in those who are in good and thence in truth; and they also join themselves together in those who are in evil and thence in falsity; with both classes these 
two faculties make one mind. But it is otherwise with those who are in truth as to faith, and in evil as to life; and also with those who are in falsity as to faith, and in apparent good as to life. </p>

<p align="center"><b>Elliott(1983-1999) 7179</b></p><p><b>7179.</b>
There are two mental powers in a person; one is called the understanding, the other the will. The will has been given to a person for the sake of the good of love, and the understanding for the sake 
of the truth of faith; for the good of love attaches itself to the will, and the truth of faith to the understanding. And each mental power communicates with the other in a remarkable manner. They become 
joined together in the case of those governed by good and from this by truth; and they also become joined together in the case of those governed by evil and from this by falsity. With both groups 
those two mental powers make a single mind. But the situation is different with those who subscribe to truth so far as belief is concerned but are governed by evil so far as life is concerned, as it is 
likewise different with those who subscribe to falsity so far as belief is concerned but are governed by seeming good so far as life is concerned. </p>

</p><b>7179.</b>
Sunt binae facultates apud hominem, una vocatur intellectus et altera voluntas; {1} voluntas data est homini propter bonum quod est amoris, et intellectus propter verum quod est fidei; nam bonum quod 
est amoris se refert ad voluntatem, et verum quod fidei se refert ad intellectum; communicat una facultas cum altera mirabiliter.  Se conjungunt apud illos qui in bono sunt et inde in vero; et quoque 
se conjungunt apud illos qui in malo sunt et inde in falso; apud hos et illos binae illae facultates faciunt unam mentem; aliter apud illos qui in vero sunt quoad fidem et in malo quoad vitam; (x)pariter 
apud illos qui in falso sunt quoad fidem et in apparente bono quoad vitam. 	@1 i et$ </p>
