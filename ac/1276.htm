<h3 align="center" class="ired">属天的奥秘 第1276节</h3>
<h4 align="center"></h4><p><strong>1276.</strong>灵人界的灵人和天堂天使定位如下：天使在主的右边，恶灵在祂的左边；中间型的人在前面；而恶人在后面；渴望高大的傲慢自负者在头顶上；与这些高处的人相对应的地狱在脚下。相对主而言，所有人的位置都是固定的，包括一切方向、高度、水平面、垂直面、倾斜方向等。他们的位置是恒定的，永远不会变化。诸天堂可以说构成一个人，因此被称作“大人”，人里面的一切事物也都与它们相对应。关于这种对应关系，蒙主怜悯，容后再述。所以，天使周围的一切事物都有相同的定位；对每个人而言，天堂由主向他开放。这就是主临在的果效，若主不全在于天堂，这是不可能的。</p>

<p><strong>[NCE]1276.</strong> In regard to spirits' position in the world of spirits and angels' position in heaven: Angels are on the Lord's right, evil spirits on his left. In front of him live people of a middling sort, at his back live the malicious. Overhead are the vain and ambitious, underfoot are hells that provide a counterpart to them. So all individuals have their own position relative to the Lord, in every quarter, at every height, on the horizontal plane and the vertical and at every angle in between. Everyone's place remains fixed, never changing to eternity.{*1} [2] The heavens in the other world make up what is essentially a single human being, which is therefore called the universal human, and everything in us corresponds to [something in] that human. The correspondence will be discussed later, with the Lord's divine mercy.{*2} As a result, everything positions itself in a similar way around every angel and within every person on earth to whom the Lord opens heaven. The Lord's presence carries this consequence with it. It would not be so if the Lord were not omnipresent in heaven.<br /><br /><strong>Footnotes:</strong><br />{*1} Contrast <a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_1276/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_967" target=_top>967</a>, in which it is suggested that spirits are allowed out of hell after punishment.

<p align="center"><b>Potts(1905-1910) 1276</b></p><p><b>1276.</b>
As regards the situation in which spirits are in the world of spirits, and angels in heaven, the case is this. The angels are at the Lord's right hand; on His left are evil spirits; in front are those 
of a middle kind; at the back are the malignant; above the head are those of a self-exalted spirit who aspire to high things; under the feet are the hells which correspond to those who are on high. 
Thus all have their situation determined relatively to the Lord; in all directions and at all altitudes, in a horizontal plane and in a vertical one, and in every oblique direction. Their situation is 
constant, and does not vary to eternity. The heavens there constitute as it were one man, which is therefore called the Grand Man; to which all things that are in man correspond; concerning which correspondence, 
of the Lord's Divine mercy hereafter. It is from this that there is a like situation of all things around each angel; and with each man to whom heaven is opened by the Lord; for the Lord's 
presence is attended with this. It would not be so unless the Lord were omnipresent in heaven. </p>

<p align="center"><b>Elliott(1983-1999) 1276</b></p><p><b>1276.</b>
Spirits in the world of spirits, and angels in heaven, are positioned as follows: Angels are on the Lord's right and evil spirits on His left. At the front are those of an intermediate kind, while the 
wicked are at the back. Overhead are those who are haughty and aspire to high things, and underfoot are the hells which correspond to those who are on high. In this way the positions of all are fixed 
in relation to the Lord, as to every direction and degree of height, horizontally and vertically, and in every oblique direction. Their positions remain constant, eternally the same. The heavens constitute 
so to speak one human being, who is therefore called the Grand Man, to which everything in the human being also corresponds. This correspondence will in the Lord's Divine mercy be dealt with later 
on. Consequently the positioning of everything around each angel is similar, and around each person to whom heaven is opened by the Lord. This is an effect of the Lord's presence, and could not happen 
if the Lord were not omnipresent in heaven. </p>

<p align="center"><b>Latin(1748-1756) 1276</b>
</p><b>1276.</b>
Quod situm attinet in quo sunt spiritus in mundo spirituum et angeli in caelo, ita se habet quod ad dextram Domini sint angeli, ad sinistram spiritus mali, antrorsum sunt qui mediae sortis, a tergo 
sunt maligni, supra caput sunt qui elato immo et alta spirant, sub pedibus sunt inferna, quae illis qui in alto, correspondent; sic omnes in suo situ respective ad Dominum, ad omnes plagas et altitudines, 
in plano horizontali, inque verticali, et ad omnem obliquitatem; situs illorum est constans, nec in aeternum variatur: caeli ibi constituunt quasi unum hominem, qui ideo appellatur Magnus Homo, cui 
quoque correspondent omnia quae sunt apud hominem, de qua correspondentia, ex Divina Domini Misericordia, in sequentibus: inde est quod circum unumquemvis angelum, similis situs omnium sit, et apud 
unumquemvis hominem cui aperitur a Domino caelum; praesentia Domini hoc secum habet; quod non ita foret nisi Dominus in caelo omnipraesens esset. </p>
