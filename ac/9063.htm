<h3 align="center" class="ired">属天的奥秘 第9063节</h3>
<h4 align="center"></h4><p><strong>9063.</strong>“就要因他的牙放他去得以自由”表它就不能再为内在人服务。这从“放去得以自由”和“牙”的含义清楚可知：“放去得以自由”是指从服事中释放出来，因而不能再服务，如前所述（<a href="9061.htm">9061</a>节）；“牙”是指感官层，如刚才所述（<a href="9062.htm">9062</a>节）。从刚才（<a href="9061.htm">9061</a>节）关于当外在人受到伤害时内在人状态的说明，可以得知此处是何情形。其情形与感官层受到伤害时的情形很相似，因为感官层是属世人中的最低层。一个人若要完全重生，感官层也必须重生（参看<a href="6844.htm">6844</a>，<a href="6845.htm">6845</a>，<a href="7645.htm">7645</a>节）。谁都能清楚看出，关于奴仆或婢女的眼和牙的这些律例，包含若不藉着内义，就没有人能明白的奥秘在里面。若没有某种隐藏的原因，经上为何会规定奴仆因严重受损的眼和牙，而不是因严重受损的身体其它部位而被放去得以自由呢？但当知道“眼”和“牙”在灵义上表示什么时，这个隐藏的原则就变得显而易见了。当知道这一切时，制定这条律例的原因就逐渐明朗了。 </p>

<p align="center"><b>Potts(1905-1910) 9063</b></p><p><b>9063.</b>
He shall let him go free for his tooth. That this signifies that it can no longer serve the internal man, is evident from the signification of "letting go free," as being to dismiss from service, thus 
no longer to serve (as above, n. 9061); and from the signification of "tooth," as being the sensuous (of which just above, n. 9062). How the case herein is can be known from what was shown just above 
(n. 9061) concerning the state of the internal man when the external has been injured. The case is similar with the sensuous when it is injured, for this is the ultimate in the natural man (that this 
also must be regenerated in order that the man may be fully regenerated, see n. 6844, 6845, 7645). That these statutes which were enacted concerning the eye and the tooth of a manservant or a maidservant, 
contain in them arcana which no one can see except by means of the internal sense, can be seen by everyone. For without some secret reason what would be the sense of decreeing that servants should 
be let go free for their eye or their tooth, and not for the sake of other members, when these should be injured or destroyed? But the secret reason is apparent when it is known what is signified 
in the spiritual sense by an "eye" and by a "tooth." When this is known, the reason for the statute comes to light. </p>

<p align="center"><b>Elliott(1983-1999) 9063</b></p><p><b>9063.</b>
'He shall send him away free for his tooth' means that it cannot serve the internal man any longer. This is clear from the meaning of 'sending away free' as releasing from service, thus not serving any 
longer, as above in <a href="9061.htm">9061</a>; and from the meaning of 'tooth' as the level of the senses, dealt with immediately above in <a href="9062.htm">9062</a>. The situation in these matters may be recognized from what has been shown 
just above in <a href="9061.htm">9061</a> regarding the condition of the internal man when the external man has been injured. Its condition is similar when the sensory level has been injured, for this is the lowest level in 
the natural man. This level too must be regenerated if a person is to be regenerated completely, see <a href="6844.htm">6844</a>, <a href="6845.htm">6845</a>, <a href="7645.htm">7645</a>. It is clear to anyone that these regulations concerning the eye or the tooth of 
a male slave or a female slave contain arcana which nobody can see without the help of the internal sense. For without some hidden reason why would it be stipulated that slaves should be released and 
go free because of an eye or because of a tooth, but not because of other parts of the body if they were badly damaged? But that hidden reason is made evident when one knows what is meant in the spiritual 
sense by 'eye' and by 'tooth'. And when one knows that, the reason for the stipulation comes to light. </p>

<p align="center"><b>Latin(1748-1756) 9063</b>
</p><b>9063.</b>
`Ad liberum {1}mittet' illum pro dente ejus': quod significet quod non servire amplius possit interno, constat ex significatione `ad liberum {2}mittere' quod sit dimittere e servitio, ita non amplius 
servire, ut supra n. 9061, et ex significatione `dentis' quod sit sensuale, de qua nunc supra n. 9062.  Quomodo cum his se habet, sciri potest ex illis quae de statu interni hominis cum externus laesus 
est, mox supra n. 9061 ostensa sunt; similiter se habet cum sensuali laeso, hoc enim est ultimum in naturali homine; quod etiam hoc regenerandum sit ut homo plene regeneratus sit, videatur n. 6844, 
6845, 7645.  Quod haec quae de oculo et de dente servi aut ancillae statuta sunt, arcana in se contineant quae nemo videre potest nisi per sensum internum, cuivis potest constare; quid enim absque arcana 
causa foret statuere quod servi dimitterentur liberi propter oculum aut propter dentem, et non propter alia membra {3}cum corrumperentur? sed arcana (d)illa causa patet cum scitur quid in spirituali 
sensu significatur per `oculum' (c)et per `dentem'; quod cum scitur, in lucem venit cur ita statutum sit. @1 dimittet$ @2 dimittere altered to mittere$ @3 si$ </p>
