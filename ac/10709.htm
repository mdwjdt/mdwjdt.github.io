<h4 align="center"></h4><p><strong>10709</strong>.他们接着说，当他们彼此交谈时，通常会进展到第九级功用；在宇宙中，有些人在说话时会进展到第五级功用，有些人则进展到第七级、第十级、第十五级、第二十级，甚至第五十级的功用。当我想知道这些话是什么意思时，他们向我解释说，这话的意思是，在远离正在讨论的那个问题的一个层面上说话。他们举例说明了这一点：当某人在一个敬拜的场所，有人问他在哪里时他们不会说他在一个敬拜的场所，而是要么说他不在家，要么说他出去了等等。当他们这么说时，其他人就会认为这个人与神同在，因而在一个敬拜的场所；因为一个在敬拜场所的人就是与神同在，并且只要与神同在，他就不在家，或出去了；他们还认为没有出去意思就是在家。他们又举了一个例子：当某人通过触动别人内心的东西来捆绑他时，他们就会对这个人说，你知道该怎么做，或现人你知道这一点，或现在知道这一点在你里面，或其它短语，只要这是一个表达这种捆绑的间接或遥远的方式。这被称为照着第五、第九、第十五、第二十，甚至第五十级的功用说话。照着功用的等级说话是天上的一种习惯和公认的表达方式；其含义取决于距离正在讨论的那个问题的遥远程度。令人惊讶的是，当有人以这种间接或遥远的方式提到某种事物时，他们立刻就知道他进展到哪个等级，无需停下来数算一下。那些使用非口头语言的人，除了这个星球的居民之外，还包括许多以同样的方式通过面部表情和唇部动作，以及照着思维观念而变化的声音发出而彼此交流的人。凡以这种方式交流的人都能立刻察觉到所传达的信息。因为他们的思维本身通过这种交流方式，比通过相对来说物质化的口头语言更能充分地展现并发表它自己。</p>

They said, further, that when they are speaking among themselves, they for the most part advance to the ninth use, and that there are some in the universe who in speaking advance to the fifth use, some 
to the seventh, to the tenth, to the fifteenth, to the twentieth, and even to the fiftieth. When I wondered what this meant it was explained, namely, that it consists in speaking remotely from the 
thing that is the subject of the discourse. This was illustrated by examples, as for instance, when someone is in a place of worship, and it is asked where he is, they do not say that he is there, but 
that he is not at home, that he is far from his house, and so on. By this they mean that he is with God, thus in the place of worship, for he who is in a place of worship is with God, and insofar as 
he is with God he is not at home, or in his own house; by being in his own house they also mean being at home. To take another example: When someone binds another by such things as are of his love, they 
say to him, "thou knowest how to do it," or "now thou art in it," or "now it is in thee," or otherwise, provided it is remotely expressed. This is called speaking to the fifth, the ninth, the fifteenth, 
the twentieth, even to the fiftieth use. To "speak to the use" is a customary expression in heaven; and its meaning is according to the degree of the remoteness from the thing which is the subject. 
And wonderful to say, when anyone speaks in this remote manner, they at once know to what degree it goes without counting it. They who are in the cogitative speech in which are the inhabitants of 
that earth, and many others who in like manner speak together by means of the face and the lips, and by what is sonorous varied according to the ideas of thought, instantly perceive the thing which is 
so spoken of; for the thought itself unfolds and publishes itself more fully by such speech than by the speech of words, which is relatively material. </p>

They went on to say that when they are talking among themselves they advance for the most part to the ninth degree of use, and that in the universe there are people who when they speak advance to the 
fifth, seventh, tenth, fifteenth, twentieth, even up to the fiftieth degree of use. This, as they explained to me when I wondered what they meant by it, means speaking on a level removed a given number 
of times from the matter that is being discussed; and they used the following examples to throw some light on this. When someone is in a place of worship and they are asked where is he, they do not 
say he is in a place of worship but either that he is not at home or that he has gone out, and so on. When they say this others take it to mean that the person is with God, thus in a place of worship; 
for one who is in a place of worship is with God, and insofar as he is with God he is not at home or has gone out. They also take not having gone out to mean being at home. Another example they gave 
was that when someone places another under obligation to him through things that touch this other's heart, they say to him, You know what to do, or Now you are in [knowledge of] it, or Now [knowledge 
of] it is in you, or some other phrase, provided that this is an indirect or remote way of expressing that obligation. This is called speaking in accord with the fifth, ninth, fifteenth, twentieth, even 
up to the fiftieth degree of use. Speaking in accord with a degree of use is a customary and accepted expression in heaven, which is used to designate the degree of remoteness from the matter that 
is being discussed. And what is astonishing, when someone uses this indirect or remote way to refer to something, others know instantly, without stopping to count, which degree he has advanced to. Those 
who use non-verbal speech include, in addition to the inhabitants of that planet, very many others who in like manner communicate with one another through facial expressions and movements of the lips, 
and also through the emission of sound varying in accord with the ideas belonging to thought. All who communicate in this way discern immediately whatever is being conveyed. For their actual thought 
is transmitted and makes itself known more fully by this way of communicating than by vocal speech, which in comparison is material.  </p>

</p><b>10709.</b>
Dicebant porro quod cum inter se loquuntur, progrediantur,  utplurimum ad nonum usum, et quod dentur in universo qui in loquendo progrediuntur ad quintum usum, ad septimum, ad decimum, ad decimum quintum, 
ad vicesimum, usque ad quinquagesimum; hoc cum miratus quid esset, explicabatur, nempe quod esset ita remote a re quae subjectum, loqui; illustrabatur res per exempla:  sicut cum aliquis in templo 
est et quaeritur ubinam, quod non dicant illum ibi esse, sed vel non esse apud se, vel procul a sua domo, et sic porro; per quod intelligunt esse apud Deum, ita in templo, nam qui in templo est, is 
apud Deum est; et quantum apud Deum tantum non est apud se, aut in sua domo; per esse in sua domo etiam intelligunt esse apud se; sit quoque exemplum:  cum quis devincit alium per talia quae sunt amoris 
ejus, ad illum dicunt scivisti facere, vel nunc es in eo, vel nunc est in te, aut aliter, modo sit remotum; hoc dicitur loqui ad 5(tum), 9(num), (x)15(mum), 20(mum), usque ad 50(mum) usum; dicere 
ad usum est formula in caelo recepta, et significat ad quem gradum a re quae subjectum; et quod mirum, cum quis loquitur ita remote, sciunt ilico ad quem gradum absque numeratione.  Qui in loquela cogitativa 
sunt, in qua illius telluris incolae, et plures alii qui similiter per faciem et labia, perque sonorum variatum secundum ideas cogitationis, consociant sermonem, percipiunt ilico de qua re ita 
dicitur, nam ipsa cogitatio plenius se explicat et propalat per talem loquelam quam per loquelam vocum, quae materialis respective. </p>
