Verses 6-14. When a man shall give to his companion silver or vessels to take care of and it be stolen out of the man's house, if the thief be caught, he shall repay double. If the thief be not caught, 
the lord of the house shall be brought unto God, to see whether he has put his hand to his companion's work. Upon every word of transgression, upon ox, upon ass, upon one of the small cattle, upon 
garment, upon every lost thing, whereof he shall say, This is it, even unto God shall come the word of them both; he whom God shall condemn shall repay double to his companion. When a man shall give to 
his companion an ass, or an ox, or one of the small cattle, or any beast, to take care of; and it die, or be broken, or be led away captive, no one seeing it; the oath of Jehovah shall be between them 
both, to see whether he hath put his hand to his companion's work, or whether its lord hath taken it, and he shall not repay. And if stealing it shall be stolen from him, he shall repay to its lord. 
If tearing it shall be torn, he shall bring a witness for it; he shall not repay that which was torn. When a man shall borrow from his companion, and it be broken, or die, the lord thereof not being 
with it, repaying he shall repay. If the lord thereof be with it, he shall not repay; if he is a hireling, he shall come in his hire. "When a man shall give to his companion silver or vessels to take 
care of" signifies truths from good and the corresponding knowledges in the memory; "and it be stolen out of the man's house" signifies the loss of them from there; "if the thief be caught" signifies 
remembrance; "he shall repay double," signifies restoration to the full; "if the thief be not caught," signifies if there is no remembrance of that which was taken away; "the lord of the house shall 
be brought unto God," signifies a search from good; "to see whether he hath put his hand to his companion's work," signifies to see whether they have entered into it; "upon every word of transgression," 
signifies whatsoever injury and whatsoever loss; "upon ox, upon ass, upon one of the small cattle," signifies of good and of truth exterior and interior; "upon garment," signifies of sensuous truth; 
"upon every lost thing, whereof he shall say, This is it," signifies everything doubtful; "even unto God shall come the word of them both; he whom God shall condemn," signifies a searching and a judging 
by means of truth; "shall repay double to his companion," signifies amendment to the full; "when a man shall give to his companion an ass, or an ox, or one of the small cattle, or any beast, to take 
care of," signifies truth and good exterior and interior, and everything that belongs to the affection of them in the memory; "and it die, or be broken," signifies loss or injury; "or be led away 
captive," signifies removal; "no one seeing it," signifies of which the mind is not conscious; "the oath of Jehovah shall be between them both," signifies a search by means of truths from the Word in 
respect to each and all of these things; "to see whether he hath put his hand to his companion's work, or whether its lord hath taken it," signifies conjunction with good; "and he shall not repay," signifies 
that there is no injury; "and if stealing it shall be stolen from him," signifies if there is loss; "he shall repay to its lord," signifies restoration in the place of it; "if tearing it shall 
be torn," signifies if the injury is not of fault; "he shall bring a witness for it," signifies that this is confirmed; "he shall not repay that which was torn," signifies no penalty; "when a man shall 
borrow from his companion," signifies truth and good from another stock; "and it be broken or die," signifies injury to it, or extinction; "its lord not being with it," signifies if the good of this 
truth is not together with it; "repaying he shall repay," signifies restoration; "if the lord thereof be with it, he shall not repay" signifies that if the good of truth be together with it, there shall 
be no restoration; "if he is a hireling," signifies if it is for the sake of the good of self-advantage; "he shall come in his hire," signifies submission and service. </p>

Verses 7-15 When a man delivers to his companion silver or vessels for safe keeping, and it is taken away by theft out of the man's house, if the thief is caught he shall repay double. If the thief is 
not caught, the master of the house shall be brought to God<A name="fntext1"></a><A href="#fn1"><sup>a</sup></a> [to see] whether or not he has put his hand into his companion's property.<A name="fntext2"></a><A href="#fn2"><sup>b</sup></a> For every matter of transgression - [whether it is] for an ox, 
for an ass, for a member of the flock, for clothing, [or] for anything that is lost, about which one says, This is it - the case<A name="fntext3"></a><A href="#fn3"><sup>c</sup></a> of both parties shall come even to God,<A name="fntext1"></a><A href="#fn1"><sup>a</sup></a> and the one whom God condemns<A name="fntext4"></a><A href="#fn4"><sup>d</sup></a> 
shall repay double to his companion. When a man delivers to his companion an ass, or an ox, or a member of the flock, or any beast for safe keeping, and it dies or is broken, or is led away 
captive, and no one sees it, an oath of Jehovah shall be between them both, [to see] whether or not its owner has put his hand into his companion's property<A name="fntext2"></a><A href="#fn2"><sup>b</sup></a> and taken it; and [the other man] shall not 
make repayment. But if it has indeed been taken away from him by theft, he shall make repayment to its owner. If it has been torn to pieces, he shall bring it [as] witness;<A name="fntext5"></a><A href="#fn5"><sup>e</sup></a> he shall not make repayment 
for what has been torn. [And] when a man borrows something from his companion, and it is broken<A name="fntext6"></a><A href="#fn6"><sup>f</sup></a> or dies, its owner not being with it, he shall surely make repayment. If its owner is with 
it, he shall not make repayment; if he is a hired servant he shall come in his hire. 'When a man delivers to his companion silver or vessels for safe keeping' means truths derived from good, and factual 
knowledge that accords with them, in the memory. 'And it is taken away by theft out of the man's house' means the loss of them from there. 'If the thief is caught' means recollection. 'He shall repay 
double' means restoration to the complete amount. 'If the thief is not caught' means, if there is no recollection of what has been taken away. 'The master of the house shall be brought to God' means 
enquiring of good. '[To see] whether or not he has put his hand into his companion's property' means whether it has entered into that good. 'For every matter of transgression' means any harm whatever 
and any loss whatever. '[Whether it is] for an ox, for an ass, for a member of the flock' means [any harm done to] good or truth, exterior or interior, [or else any loss of them]. 'For clothing' means 
[any harm done to or else loss of] truth on the level of the senses. '[Or] for anything that is lost, about which one says, This is it' means anything uncertain. 'The case of both parties shall come 
even to God, and the one whom God condemns' means enquiry made and decision reached through truth. 'Shall repay double to his companion' means making amends to the complete amount. 'When a man delivers 
to his companion an ass, or an ox, or a member of the flock, or any beast for safe keeping' means truth and good, exterior and interior, in the memory, and anything there belonging to an affection 
for them. 'And it dies or is broken' means loss or harm. 'Or is led away captive' means removal. 'And no one sees it' means which the mind is not aware of. 'An oath of Jehovah shall be between them 
both' means enquiry made through truths from the Word regarding every single aspect of these things. '[To see] whether or not its owner has put his hand into his companion's property and taken it' means 
being joined together under [the influence of] good. 'And [the other man] shall not make repayment' means that no harm has been done. 'But if it has indeed been taken away from him by theft' means 
if loss has taken place. 'He shall make repayment to its owner' means restoration, to replace it. 'If it has been torn to pieces' means if harm is done for which the person is not blameworthy. 'He shall 
bring it [as] witness' means confirmation of this. 'He shall not make repayment for what has been torn' means that there shall be no punishment. 'And when a man borrows something from his companion' 
means truth from a different stock. 'And it is broken or dies' means harm done to it or the annihilation of it. 'Its owner not being with it' means if the good of that truth does not exist along with 
[the general good]. 'He shall surely make repayment' means undertaking restoration. 'If its owner is with it, he shall not make repayment' means that if the good of truth is present along with it no 
restoration is required. 'If he is a hired servant' means if for the sake of beneficial gain. 'He shall come in his hire' means being submissive and subservient.
