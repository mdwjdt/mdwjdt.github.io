<h3 align="center" class="ired">属天的奥秘 第2475节</h3>
<h4 align="center"></h4><p><strong>2475.</strong>至今没人知道就记忆而言，人死后灵魂的状态如何。通过多年来的大量和日常经验，我得以知道，死后，凡存放在人记忆里的东西，无论是外部记忆的还是内部记忆的，丝毫不会丢失。事实的确如此，因为对人来说，没有什么东西会被视为太过微不足道，或太过细小，以至于他里面会没有它。所以，死后，除了人的骨、肉之外，他不会遗留丝毫东西。而他在世时，其骨、肉凭自己毫无生气，而是凭他灵的生命而具有生机，他的灵是附着于肉体之物的更精纯的物质。</p>

<p align="center"><b>Potts(1905-1910) 2475</b></p><p><b>2475.</b>
As yet no one knows what is the state of souls after death in respect to the memory. From much and daily experience of many years, it has been given me to know that after death a man loses nothing whatever 
of what has been in his memories, whether in the exterior or in the interior memory; insomuch that nothing can possibly be thought of so small or so minute that the man does not have it with him; 
so that after death he leaves nothing whatever behind him except his bones and flesh, which, while he lived in the world, were not animated from themselves, but from the life of his spirit, which was 
his purer substance annexed to the things of the body. </p>

<p align="center"><b>Elliott(1983-1999) 2475</b></p><p><b>2475.</b>
Until now nobody has known what the state of souls is after death as regards memory. From considerable and daily experience extending over many years now I have been given to know that after death man 
loses not one tiny part of what is lodged in the two memories - neither things that have been lodged in the exterior memory nor those in the interior. So true is this that nothing can ever be considered 
too insignificant or too tiny for man not to have it within him. Absolutely nothing is left behind after death therefore apart from flesh and bones which during his lifetime were vitalized not of 
themselves but from the life of his spirit whose purer substance was linked to the things of the body. </p>

<p align="center"><b>Latin(1748-1756) 2475</b>
</p><b>2475.</b>
Nulli adhuc notum est, quis status animarum post mortem quoad memoriam; ex multa et diuturna nunc per plures annos experientia scire datum est quod homo post mortem ne hilum amittat ab illis quae in 
ejus memoriis, tam quae in exteriore quam quae in interiore fuerunt, adeo ut nusquam tam pusillum aut tam minimum cogitari possit, quod non homo secum habeat; sic ut nihil prorsus post mortem relinquat 
quam solum ossa et carnem, quae dum vixit in mundo, non animata fuerunt a se, sed a vita spiritus ejus, quae purior ejus substantia annexa corporeis fuit. </p>
