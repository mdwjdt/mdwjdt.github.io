Vers. 27.  Et hae nativitates Terahi; Terah genuit Abramum, Nahorem, et Haranem; et Haran genuit Lotum. 'Hae nativitates Terahi' significant origines et derivationes idololatriae, ex qua Ecclesia repraesentativa: 
 Terahus fuit filius Nahoris, tum gens ab illo ut a suo patre nominata; per illum significatur cultus idololatricus Abram, Nahor et Haran fuerunt filii Terahi, tum gentes ab illis ut a 
suis patribus nominatae; per illos hic significantur cultus idololatrici inde:  ex Loto etiam fuerunt binae gentes quae idololatrae. </p>
