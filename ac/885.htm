<h4 align="center"></h4><p><strong>885.</strong>“叶”表真理，这一点从圣言中的大量经文明显可知，其中人被比作树，或称作树，“果”由此表源于仁爱的良善，“叶”表由此而来的真理，因为这些的确就象果和叶。如以西结书：<br />在河这边与那边的岸上必生长各类可作食物的树木。其叶子不凋残，果子不断绝。每月必结新果子，因为这水是从圣所流出来的；其果子必作食物，其叶子乃为治病。（以西结书<a href="http://39-27.cn/结47.12.htm">47:12</a>；启示录<a href="http://39-27.cn/启22.2.htm">22:2</a>）<br />此处“树”表内心拥有主之国的教会成员，“果子”表源于爱与仁的良善，“叶子”表源于那良善的真理，它们有助于教导人类，使其重生，为此，叶子被说成是为“治病”。同一先知书：<br />他岂不拔出它的根来，芟除它的果子，使它枯干吗？从枝上摘掉的所有叶子都枯萎了。（以西结书<a href="http://39-27.cn/结17.9.htm">17:9</a>）<br />此处论述的是葡萄树，也就是处于荒凉状态的教会，其良善，即“果子”，其真理，即“从枝上摘掉的所有叶子”就这样枯萎了。<br />耶利米书：<br />倚靠耶和华的，那人有福了；他必像树栽于水旁；叶子必青翠；他在干旱之年毫无挂虑，而且结果不止。（耶利米书<a href="http://39-27.cn/耶17.7.htm">17:7</a>-<a href="http://39-27.cn/耶17.8.htm">8</a>）<br />“青翠的叶子”表信之真理，因而表源于仁爱的信本身。在诗篇（<a href="http://39-27.cn/诗1.3.htm">1:3</a>）中也是如此。同一先知书：<br />葡萄树上必没有葡萄，无花果树上必没有无花果，叶子都已凋零。（耶利米书<a href="http://39-27.cn/耶8.13.htm">8:13</a>）<br />“葡萄树上的葡萄”表属灵的良善；“无花果树上的无花果”表属世的良善；“叶子”表真理，在这种情况下，它已“凋零”。以赛亚书（<a href="http://39-27.cn/赛34.4.htm">34:4</a>）中同样如此。耶稣所看到的无花果树所表相同，因祂在上面只找到叶子，所以它枯干了（马太福音<a href="http://39-27.cn/太21.19.htm">21:19</a>-<a href="http://39-27.cn/太21.20.htm">20</a>；马可福音<a href="http://39-27.cn/可11.13.htm">11:13</a>-<a href="http://39-27.cn/可11.14.htm">14</a>，<a href="http://39-27.cn/可11.20.htm">20</a>）。这棵无花果树尤指犹太教会。该教会连属世的良善都没有了，被保存在它里面、涉及信的教义或真理就是“叶子”。因为荒凉的教会是知道真理，却不愿理解它的那种。它们就象那些说自己知道真理或信，却毫无仁之善可言的人：它们不过是无花果叶，并会枯干。</p>

<p><strong>[NCE]885.</strong> The symbolism of a leaf as truth is established by numerous passages in the Word comparing us to, or actually calling us, trees. In those places, fruit symbolizes the good espoused by charity and a leaf the truth to which it leads (and charity and truth also function the same way fruit and leaves do). In Ezekiel, for example:<br />Beside the river, on its bank, on this side and that, grows every food tree, whose leaf does not fall and whose fruit is not used up; month by month it is reborn, because its waters are going out from the sanctuary. And its fruit will serve as food, and its leaf, as medicine. (<a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_885/bible_king-james-version_ezekiel_47_12" target=_top>Ezekiel 47:12</a>; <a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_885/bible_king-james-version_revelation_22_2" target=_top>Revelation 22:2</a>)<br />The tree stands for the people of a church that embodies the Lord's kingdom. The fruit stands for the good that results from love and charity, and the leaf, for the truth that develops out of it. That truth is used for the instruction and regeneration of the human race, which is why the leaf is said to serve as medicine. In the same author:<br />Will he not tear out its roots and cut down its fruit, and it will wither? All the torn-off [leaves]{*1} of its new growth will wither. (<a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_885/bible_king-james-version_ezekiel_17_9" target=_top>Ezekiel 17:9</a>)<br />This is about a devastated grapevine (church), of which the fruit (goodness) and what is torn off the new growth (truth) will wither in this way.<br />[2] In Jeremiah:<br />Blessed is the man who trusts in Jehovah. He will be like a tree planted by the water. His leaf will be green; in a year of shortage, he will not worry. And he will not leave off making fruit. (<a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_885/bible_king-james-version_jeremiah_17_7-8" target=_top>Jeremiah 17:7-8</a>)<br />The green leaf stands for the truth that composes faith and so for the faith itself that springs from charity. David has similar words in <a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_885/bible_king-james-version_psalms_1_3" target=_top>Psalms 1:3</a>. In the same prophet:<br />There are no grapes on the grapevine and no figs on the fig tree, and the leaf has fallen off. (<a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_885/bible_king-james-version_jeremiah_8_13" target=_top>Jeremiah 8:13</a>)<br />Grapes on the vine stand for spiritual goodness, and figs on the fig tree for earthly goodness. The leaf stands for truth, which falls off in this way. <a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_885/bible_king-james-version_isaiah_34_4" target=_top>Isaiah 34:4</a> is parallel. Something similar is meant by the fig tree that Jesus saw and on which he found nothing but leaves, so that it withered (<a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_885/bible_king-james-version_matthew_21_1-46" target=_top>Matthew 21</a>: [19,] 20; <a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_885/bible_king-james-version_mark_11_13-14" target=_top>Mark 11:13-14</a>). The fig tree in this case specifically refers to the Jewish church, in which there was no longer any earthly goodness. The doctrinal precepts of faith (or truth) preserved among them are the leaves. A church that has been devastated is such that it knows the truth but does not want to understand it. The same applies to people who say they know the truth, or the tenets of religion, yet possess none of charity's goodness. They are only fig leaves, and they wither.<br /><br /><strong>Footnotes:</strong><br />{*1} This bracketed interpolation is Swedenborg's. [LHC] </p>

That a "leaf" signifies truth, is evident from many passages in the Word where man is compared to a tree, or is called a tree, and where "fruits" signify the good of charity, and a "leaf" the truth therefrom 
(which indeed they are like); as in Ezekiel: </p>
<p>     And by the river upon the bank thereof, on this side and on that side, there cometh up every tree for food, whose leaf doth not fall, neither 
is the fruit consumed, it is reborn every month, because the waters thereof issue out of the sanctuary; and the fruit thereof shall be for food, and the leaf thereof for medicine (Ezek. 47:12; Rev. 
22:2). Here "tree" denotes the man of the church in whom is the kingdom of the Lord; its "fruit" the good of love and of charity; its "leaf" the truths therefrom, which serve for the instruction of the 
human race and for their regeneration, for which reason the leaf is said to be for "medicine." Again: </p>
<p>     Shall He not pull up the roots thereof, and cut off the fruit thereof that it wither? it 
shall wither in all the plucked off [leaves] of its shoot (Ezek. 17:9). This is said of the vine, that is, the church, in a state of vastation, whose good, which is the "fruit" and whose truth, which 
is the "plucked off [leaf] of the shoot" thus withers.  [2] In Jeremiah: </p>
<p>     Blessed is the man that trusteth in Jehovah; he shall be like a tree planted by the waters; his leaf shall be green; and 
he shall not be anxious in the year of drought, neither shall cease from yielding fruit (Jer. 17:7-8); </p>
<p>where the "green leaf" denotes the truth of faith, thus the very faith which is from charity. 
So in David (Ps. 1:3); and again in Jeremiah: There shall be no grapes on the vine, nor figs on the fig-tree, and the leaf is fallen (Jer. 8:13); </p>
<p>"grapes on the vine" denote spiritual good; "figs on 
the fig-tree" natural good; "leaf" truth, which in this case is "fallen." Likewise in Isaiah (34:4). The same is meant by the fig-tree which Jesus saw and found nothing thereon but leaves, and which therefore 
withered away (Matt. 21:19, 20; Mark 11:13-14, 20). Specifically, by this fig-tree there was meant the Jewish Church, in which there was no longer anything of natural good; and the religious 
teaching or truth that was preserved in it, are the "leaves;" for a vastated church is such that it knows truth, but is not willing to understand it. Similar are those who say that they know truth or 
the things of faith, yet have nothing of the good of charity: they are only fig-leaves, and they wither away. </p>

<p align="center"><b>Elliott(1983-1999) 885</b></p><p><b>885.</b>
That 'a leaf' means truth is clear from various places in the Word, where man is compared to or actually called a tree. 'Fruit' in those contexts means the good that stems from charity, and 'leaf' the 
truth deriving from this, for these are indeed like fruit and leaves, as in Ezekiel, </p>
<blockquote>
Beside the river there is rising up upon its bank, on this side and on that, every tree for food, whose leaf does 
not fall, nor its fruit fail, but is reborn monthly, for its waters flow out from the Sanctuary, and its fruit will be for food, and its leaf for medicine. <a href="http://bible.gospelcom.net/cgi-bin/bible?passage=Ezek%2047:11&amp;version=ESV&amp;interface=print&amp;showfn=yes&amp;showxref">Ezek 47:11</a>; <a href="http://bible.gospelcom.net/cgi-bin/bible?passage=Rev%2022:1&amp;version=ESV&amp;interface=print&amp;showfn=yes&amp;showxref">Rev 22:1</a>. 
</blockquote>
<p>Here 'tree' stands 
for the member of the Church who has the Lord's kingdom within him, 'fruit' stands for the good that stems from love and charity, 'leaf for truths deriving from that good which serve to instruct 
the human race and to regenerate it. And because truths do this the leaf is said to be 'for medicine'. In the same prophet,  </p>
<blockquote>
Will He not pull up its roots and cut off its fruit so that it withers? 
And all the plucked off (leaves) from its off-shoot will wither. <a href="http://bible.gospelcom.net/cgi-bin/bible?passage=Ezek%2017:9&amp;version=ESV&amp;interface=print&amp;showfn=yes&amp;showxref">Ezek 17:9</a>. 
</blockquote>
<p>The subject here is the vine, which is the Church, when it has been vastated, whose good, which is 'the fruit', and its 
truth, which is that 'plucked off from its off-shoot', thus wither away. </p>
<p></p>
<p><b>[2]</b>
 In Jeremiah, </p>
<blockquote>
Blessed is the man who trusts in Jehovah. He will be like a tree planted beside the waters. His leaf will 
be green, and in the year of scarcity he will not be anxious. Nor will he cease to bear fruit. <a href="http://bible.gospelcom.net/cgi-bin/bible?passage=Jer%2017:7,%208&amp;version=ESV&amp;interface=print&amp;showfn=yes&amp;showxref">Jer 17:7, 8</a>. 
</blockquote>
<p>Green leaf' stands for the truth of faith, and so for faith itself which derives from 
charity. The same applies in David, <a href="http://bible.gospelcom.net/cgi-bin/bible?passage=Ps%201:3&amp;version=ESV&amp;interface=print&amp;showfn=yes&amp;showxref">Ps 1:3</a>. In the same prophet, </p>
<blockquote>
There will be no grapes on the vine, nor figs on the fig tree, and its leaf has fallen. <a href="http://bible.gospelcom.net/cgi-bin/bible?passage=Jer%208:13&amp;version=ESV&amp;interface=print&amp;showfn=yes&amp;showxref">Jer 8:13</a>. 
</blockquote>
<p>'Grapes on the vine' stands 
for spiritual good, 'figs on the fig tree' for natural good, leaf' for truth, which has accordingly fallen. Likewise in <a href="http://bible.gospelcom.net/cgi-bin/bible?passage=Isa%2074:4&amp;version=ESV&amp;interface=print&amp;showfn=yes&amp;showxref">Isa 74:4</a>. Similar things were meant by 'the fig tree' that Jesus saw, which was 
made to wither away when He found nothing but leaves on it, <a href="http://bible.gospelcom.net/cgi-bin/bible?passage=Matt%2021:20&amp;version=ESV&amp;interface=print&amp;showfn=yes&amp;showxref">Matt 21:20</a>; <a href="http://bible.gospelcom.net/cgi-bin/bible?passage=Mark%2011:13,%2014&amp;version=ESV&amp;interface=print&amp;showfn=yes&amp;showxref">Mark 11:13, 14</a>. The Jewish Church in particular was what 'the fig tree' was used to mean on that occasion. With this Church no 
natural good existed any longer, only that preserved with them which was meant by 'a leaf', namely doctrine, or truth, concerning faith. A Church that has been vastated is one that knows truth but has 
no wish to understand it. They are like people who say they know the truth, or matters of faith, but who possess no good at all that stems from charity. They are merely 'fig leaves', and they wither away. </p>

Quod" 'folium' significet verum, constat passim a Verbo, ubi homo comparatur arbori, seu appellatur arbor; ibi 'fructus' significant bonum charitatis, et 'folium' verum inde; similiter etiam se habent; 
ut apud Ezechielem, 	Juxta fluvium ascendit super ripa ejus hinc et illinc omnis arbor cibi, cujus non decidit folium, nec consumitur fructus, in menses suos renascitur; quia aquae ejus e Sanctuario 
ipsae exeuntes; et erit fructus ejus in cibum, et folium ejus in medicinam, xlvii 12; Apoc. xxii 2; </p>
<p>ibi 'arbor' pro homine Ecclesiae in quo regnum Domini, 'fructus' pro bono amoris et charitatis, 
'folium' pro veris inde, quae ad instructionem generis humani et ejus regenerationem inserviunt, quare folium dicitur esse 'in medicinam': apud eundem, 	Nonne radices ejus evellet et fructum ejus succidet: 
et exarescet? omnia decerpta (folia) germinis ejus arescet, xvii 9; </p>
<p>ibi de vite, seu de Ecclesia, vastata, cujus bonum quod est 'fructus,, et 'decerptum germinis' quod est verum, ita arescit: 
apud Jeremiam, 	Benedictus vir qui confidit in Jehovah;... erit sicut arbor plantata juxta aquas;... erit folium ejus viride, in anno caritatis {1} non erit sollicitus; et non recedet a 	faciendo fructum, 
xvii 7, 8; </p>
<p>'folium viride' pro vero fidei, ita pro ipsa fide quae ex charitate; similiter apud Davidem, Ps. i 3: apud eundem prophetam, 	Non uvae in vite, nec ficus in ficu, et folium decidit, 
viii 13, 'uvae in vite' pro bono spirituali, 'ficus in ficu' pro bono naturali, 'folium' pro vero, quod ita decidit; pariter Esai. xxxiv 4.  Similia intellecta sunt per 'ficum' quam Jesus vidit et 
ubi nihil invenit praeter 'folia,' quare arefacta, Matth. xxi 20; Mar. xi 13, 14; erat Ecclesia Judaica in specie per 'ficum' hic intellecta, apud quam nihil boni naturalis amplius; sed doctrinale fidei 
seu verum quod apud eam conservatum, est 'folium'; Ecclesia vastata talis est quod sciat verum sed non vult intelligere; similes sunt qui dicant se scire verum, seu quae fidei sunt, et nihil boni charitatis 
habent; sunt modo 'folia ficus,' et arescunt. 	@1 Sch. has siccitatis, which S. copies in A.E. 451; but Heb. [ ] (batsoreth) = restraint, scarcity.$ </p>
