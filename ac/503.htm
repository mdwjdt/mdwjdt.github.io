<h3 align="center" class="ired">属天的奥秘 第503节</h3>
<h4 align="center"></h4><p><strong>503.</strong>上古教会的直觉不仅在于直觉何为善与真，还在于直觉行善的欢喜快乐。若没有行善的欢喜快乐，直觉就没有生命，欢喜快乐是直觉的生命源头。爱及其衍生之信的生命，诸如上古教会所拥有的，是伴随着发挥作用而来的生命，也就是随着与用相伴的善与真而来的生命。主注入生命正是由于用、通过用、照着用。没有用的东西其中也没有生命，因为凡无用的皆被丢弃。在这方面，上古之人是主的样式，因此在直觉上，他们也成为祂的形像。直觉在于知道何为善与真，因而知道何为信的实质。若有爱在里面，谁都不满足于知道，还要行出善与真，也就是致力于用。</p>

<p><strong>[NCE]503.</strong> The earliest church's perceptive ability was not restricted to an awareness of what was good and true but included happiness and joy in doing good. Without happiness and joy in doing good, perception is not alive; from that happiness and joy it lives. The living quality of love and of the faith that comes from love, such as it was in the earliest church, is a quality we have when we are being useful, or when we adopt the goodness and truth that come from useful activity. Usefulness is the source from which, the means by which, and the measure according to which the Lord gives us life. Nothing useless can have any life in it, because anything that is useless is rejected.<br />In this, the earliest people were likenesses of the Lord; consequently in their perceptive abilities they became images of him. To be perceptive is to recognize what is good and true and so what is appropriate to faith. One who is under the influence of love is not satisfied with just knowing what is good and true but wants to do it — that is, to be useful. </p>
<p align="center"><b>Potts(1905-1910) 503</b></p><p><b>503.</b>
The perceptive faculty of the Most Ancient Church consisted not only in the perception of what is good and true, but also in the happiness and delight arising from well-doing; without such happiness 
and delight in doing what is good the perceptive faculty has no life, but by virtue of such happiness and delight it receives life. The life of love, and of the derivative faith, such as the Most Ancient 
Church enjoyed, is life while in the performance of use, that is, in the good and truth of use: from use, by use, and according to use, is life given by the Lord; there can be no life in what is useless, 
for whatever is useless is cast away. In this respect the most ancient people were likenesses of the Lord, and therefore in perceptive powers they became images of Him. The perceptive power consists 
in knowing what is good and true, consequently what is of faith: he who is in love is not delighted in knowing, but in doing what is good and true, that is, in being useful. </p>

<p align="center"><b>Elliott(1983-1999) 503</b></p><p><b>503.</b>
The perceptivity of the Most Ancient Church lay not merely in their perceiving what good and truth were but also in the joy and delight of doing what was good. Without this joy and delight of doing what 
is good perceptivity is without life. They are the source of its life. The life of love and faith deriving from it, such as the Most Ancient Church possessed, is a life that comes with performing 
use, that is, with the good and truth that accompany use. It is from use, by way of use, and according to use,that life is imparted by the Lord. And that which is without use can have no life in it, for 
that which is without use is casta side. In this respect those people were likenesses of the Lord, and in their perceptivity therefore became images too. Perceptivity is knowing what good and truth 
are, and so knowing what is the substance of faith. Anyone who has love within him is not content just with knowing, but with doing what is good and true, that is, with engaging in a use.  </p>

<p align="center"><b>Latin(1748-1756) 503</b>
</p><b>503.</b>
Perceptivum Ecclesiae Antiquissimae non solum constabat in eo quod perceperint quid bonum et verum, sed in felici et jucundo bonum agendi; absque felici et jucundo bonum agendi, perceptivum non est 
vivum, sed inde vivit; vita amoris et inde fidei qualis fuit Antiquissimae Ecclesiae, est vita dum in usu seu in bono et vero usus; ex usu, per usum et secundum usum datur vita a Domino; inutili nulla 
potest esse vita, nam quicquid inutile est, rejicitur: in illo fuerunt similitudines Domini; quare etiam in perceptivis facti sunt imagines; perceptivum est nosse quid bonum et verum, ita quid fidei; 
qui in amore est, is non delectatur nosse, sed facere bonum et verum, hoc est, usui esse. </p>
