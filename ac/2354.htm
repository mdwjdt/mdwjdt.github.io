<h3 align="center" class="ired">属天的奥秘 第2354节</h3>
<h4 align="center"></h4><p><strong>2354.</strong>“把他们带出来，任我们所为”表那时他们想说明承认这两个天使（即主的神圣人性和神圣活动）的存在是错误的。这从那“两个天使”的含义（参看<a href="2320.htm">2320</a>节），以及对这些含有拒绝接受意味的话感到愤怒清楚可知。<br />此处描述了一个已经荒废的教会的第一个状态，也就是教会因没有仁而开始没有信之时的状态。如前所述，这种状态是这样：他们因反对仁之善而没有任何信，尤其不承认主的神圣人性和神圣活动。凡过着邪恶生活的人，也就是说，与自己相比蔑视别人，仇恨尊敬自己的人，以报复他们为乐，甚至以残忍为乐，视奸淫为无足轻重之事的所有人都会发自内心拒绝接受这两个天使。过去公开否认主神性的法利赛人，都比如今为了获得尊敬和自己污秽的利益而表面上虔诚敬拜主，内心却藏污纳垢的这类人做得好。下文“所多玛人”，以及之后那城的倾覆（24-25节）就描绘了诸如此类的这些人的相继发展和厄运。<br />如前面数次说明的，与人同在的既有恶灵，同时也有天使。他通过恶灵与地狱相联，通过天使与天堂相联（<a href="687.htm">687</a>，<a href="697.htm">697</a>节）。因此，他的生命越接近邪恶，地狱就越流入进来；越接近良善，天堂，因而主就越流入进来。由此明显可知，凡过着邪恶生活的人都不承认主，而会捏造无数论述反对主，因为所流入的地狱幻觉被他们接受。而凡过着良善生活的人则都承认主，因为天堂会流进来，其中主要是爱与仁，因为天堂是主的，一切爱与仁皆源于主（参看<a href="537.htm">537</a>，<a href="540.htm">540</a>，<a href="547.htm">547</a>，<a href="548.htm">548</a>，<a href="551.htm">551</a>，<a href="553.htm">553</a>，<a href="685.htm">685</a>，<a href="2130.htm">2130</a>节）。</p>

Bring them out unto us, that we may know them. That this signifies that they desired to show that it is false to acknowledge that these exist (namely, the Lord's Divine Human and Holy proceeding), is 
evident from the signification of the "two angels" (see n. 2320); as also from the angry feeling with which these things were said, and in which there is what is expressive of denial. [2] There is here 
described the first state of a vastated church; that is, the state when there begins to be no faith because there is no charity; which state as before said is that because they are against the good 
of charity they are also in no faith, and especially in no acknowledgment of the Lord's Divine Human and Holy proceeding. These are at heart denied by all who are in a life of evil, that is, by all 
who despise others in comparison with themselves, who hate those who do not pay them respect, who feel a delight in being revenged on them, who even feel delight in cruelty, and who regard adulteries 
as matters of no moment. The Pharisees of old, who openly denied the Lord's Divinity, did better than is the case with such men at the present day, who for the sake of their own exaltation and sordid 
enrichment outwardly worship Him in a holy manner, but inwardly cherish that profane state. The successive development and doom of such as these is described in what follows by the men of Sodom, and finally 
by the overthrow of that city (verses 24-25). [3] The case with man (as before stated several times) is that there are with him evil spirits, and at the same time angels. Through the evil spirits 
he communicates with hell, and through the angels with heaven (n. 687, 697). Insofar therefore as his life approximates to what is evil, so far hell flows in; but insofar as his life approximates 
to what is good, so far heaven flows in, and therefore the Lord. From this it is evident that they who are in a life of evil cannot acknowledge the Lord, but frame for themselves innumerable things against 
Him; because the phantasies of hell flow in and are received by them. But they who are in a life of good acknowledge the Lord, because heaven flows in, in which love and charity are the main thing; 
because heaven is the Lord's, from whom come all things of love and charity (see n. 537, 540, 547, 548, 551, 553, 685, 2130). </p>

'Bring them out to us and let us know them' means their wish to show that it is false to acknowledge the existence of these, that is to say, of the Lord's Divine Human and His Holy proceeding. This is 
clear from the meaning of 'the two angels', dealt with above in <a href="2320.htm">2320</a>, and also from the feeling of anger with which these words were uttered, and which carries an expression of denial within it. </p>

<p><b>[2]</b>
Being described here is the initial state of the Church that has been vastated, that is, when faith starts to be no more because charity is no more. This state, as has been said, is one in which, 
because they are opposed to the good of charity, no faith exists with them, in particular no acknowledgement of the Lord's Divine Human and His Holy proceeding. All who lead a life of evil deny these 
at heart, that is to say, all who despise others in comparison with themselves, who hate all those who do not treat them with respect, who take delight in getting their revenge on such, and indeed in 
being cruel to them, and who think that acts of adultery do not matter. 'The Pharisees who openly denied the Lord's Divinity did better in their own day than such people today who, for the sake of the 
respect paid to them and for the sake of their own filthy gain, outwardly worship Him devoutly but inwardly conceal such unholiness. These, as they were progressively to become, are pictured in what 
follows as 'the men of Sodom', and after that in the overthrow of that city, verses 24, 25. </p>

<p><b>[3]</b>
 As stated frequently already, man has evil spirits and at the same time angels present with him. Through 
the evil spirits he communicates with hell, and through the angels with heaven, <a href="687.htm">687</a>, <a href="697.htm">697</a>. To the extent therefore that his life moves towards evil, hell flows in; but to the extent his life moves 
towards good, heaven and so the Lord flows in. From this it is clear that people who lead lives of evil are incapable of acknowledging the Lord. Instead they invent countless arguments against Him, for 
the delusions of hell flow in which are received by them. But those who lead lives of good do acknowledge the Lord, for they have heaven flowing into them, where love and charity reign supreme since 
heaven is the Lord's, who is the source from which everything of love and charity derives, see <a href="537.htm">537</a>, <a href="540.htm">540</a>, <a href="547.htm">547</a>, <a href="548.htm">548</a>, <a href="551.htm">551</a>, <a href="553.htm">553</a>, <a href="685.htm">685</a>, <a href="2130.htm">2130</a> </p>

Quod `educ eos ad nos, et cognoscamus eos' significet quod ostendere vellent quod sit falsum agnoscere quod sint, nempe Divinum Humanum et Sanctum procedens Domini, constat a significatione `duorum 
angelorum,' de qua supra n. 2320; tum etiam ab affectu irae in quo haec dicta sunt, in quo quod dicitur est negativum.  [2] Hic primus status Ecclesiae vastatae, hoc est, cum nulla fides, qui nulla charitas, 
incipit esse, describitur; qui status est, ut dictum, quo quia contra bonum charitatis sunt, etiam in nulla fide sint, imprimis in nulla agnitione Divini Humani et Sancti procedentis Domini; hoc 
{1} corde negant omnes illi qui in vita mali sunt, nempe omnes illi qui alios prae se contemnunt, odio habent omnes {2} qui se non colunt, qui in vindictis contra eosdem, immo in crudelitate, jucundum 
sentiunt quique adulteria pro nihilo reputant; melius suo tempore fecerunt Pharisaei qui negarunt aperte Divinum Domini, quam tales hodie qui, sui cultus et foedi lucri causa, Ipsum exterius sancte 
colunt, at interius profanum illud recondunt; hi quales successive fiunt describitur in sequentibus per `viros Sodomae,' et demum per eversionem ejus, vers. 24, 25.  [3] Se habet cum homine, ut prius 
aliquoties dictum, quod sint apud eam spiritus mali, et simul angeli; per spiritus malos communicat ille cum inferno, et per angelos cum caelo, n. 687: 697; quantum itaque vita ejus accedit ad malum, 
tantum influit infernum, quantum autem vita accedit ad bonum, tantum influit caelum, ita Dominus: inde constat quod qui in vita mali, non possint agnoscere Dominum, sed quod innumera sibi fingant contra 
Ipsum, quia influunt {3} phantasiae inferni, quas recipiunt; at qui in vita hoc sunt, ii agnoscunt Dominum quia influit caelum, in quo amor et charitas principale est, quia caelum est Domini, a Quo 
omnia amoris et charitatis, videatur n. 537, 540, 547, 548, 552, 553, 685, 2130. 	@1 haec.$ 	@2 eos.$ 	@3 influant I.$ </p>
