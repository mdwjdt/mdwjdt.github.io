<h3 align="center" class="ired">属天的奥秘 第4977节</h3>
<h4 align="center"></h4><p><strong>4977.</strong>“并且他派约瑟管理他的家”表这良善将自己应用于记忆知识。这从“主”和“派约瑟管理他的家”的含义清楚可知：派约瑟管理的他所指的“主”是指良善（参看<a href="4973.htm">4973</a>节）；“派约瑟管理他的家”是指将自己应用于它，也就是应用于记忆知识或属世真理。这层意义从接下来话明显看出来，在那里经上说：“把一切所有的都交在约瑟手里”，以此表示属于这良善的一切似乎都服从另一个人的权柄和掌控。因为良善是主，真理是事奉或服侍者；当经上论到主说，他派一个事奉者或服侍者管理，或论到良善说，它派真理管理时，就内义而言，意思不是说王权不在于那良善，而是说它将自己应用于真理。因为人在内义上所感知到的是真实事物，而字义却以表象的形式将它呈现出来。因为良善一直执掌王权，但却将自己应用出来，好叫真理能与它结合。当人处于真理时，如他重生之前的情形，他对良善几乎一无所知；因为真理经由外在或感官途径流入，但良善经由内在途径流入。人能感觉到经由外在途径流入之物，但在重生之前，却感觉不到经由内在途径流入之物。所以，除非在最先到来的状态下，王权似乎被赋予真理，也就是说，除非良善将自己应用于真理，否则真理永远不可能变成良善自己的。这就是前面多次提到的因素，即：当人正经历重生时，表面上看，似乎真理占据第一位，或可以说它是主；不过，一旦人重生，良善明显占据第一位，就是主（参看<a href="3539.htm">3539</a>，<a href="3548.htm">3548</a>，<a href="3556.htm">3556</a>，<a href="3563.htm">3563</a>，<a href="3570.htm">3570</a>，<a href="3576.htm">3576</a>，<a href="3603.htm">3603</a>，<a href="3701.htm">3701</a>，<a href="4925.htm">4925</a>，<a href="4926.htm">4926</a>，<a href="4928.htm">4928</a>，<a href="4930.htm">4930</a>节）。</p>

And he set him over his house. That this signifies that good applied itself thereto, is evident from the signification of the "lord," who set him over, as being good (see n. 4973); and from the signification 
of "setting him over his house," as being to apply itself thereto, namely, to memory-knowledge or natural truth. That this is the meaning is plain from the words that follow, where it is said 
that "all that he had he gave into his hand," by which is signified that all that belonged to it was as it were in its power. For good is lord, and truth is minister; and when it is said of a lord that 
he "set a minister over," or of good that it "set truth over," in the internal sense it is not signified that it ceded the dominion thereto, but that it applied itself. For in the internal sense a 
thing is perceived as it is in itself; but in the sense of the letter it is set forth according to the appearance; for good always has the dominion, but applies itself in order that truth may be conjoined 
with it. When man is in truth, as is the case before he has been regenerated, he knows scarcely anything about good; for truth flows in by an external or sensuous way, but good by an internal way. 
Man is sensible of that which flows in by an external way, but not, until he has been regenerated, of that which flows in by an internal way; so that unless in the prior state a sort of dominion were 
given to truth, or unless good so applied itself, truth would never be made good's own. This is the same as what has already been often shown-that while man is being regenerated truth is apparently 
in the first place, or as it were the lord; but that good is manifestly in the first place and lord when he has been regenerated (see n. 3539, 3548, 3556, 3563, 3570, 3576, 3603, 3701, 4925, 4926, 4928, 4930). </p>

<p align="center"><b>Elliott(1983-1999) 4977</b></p><p><b>4977.</b>
'And he put him in charge over his house' means that this good applied itself to that factual knowledge. This is clear from the meaning of his 'lord', who put him in charge, as good, dealt with above 
in <a href="4977.htm">4977</a>, and from the meaning of 'putting him in charge over his house' as applying itself to it - to factual knowledge or natural truth. This meaning is evident from what follows, where it says that 
'whatever he had he gave into his hand', meaning that all belonging to that good was seemingly subject to the other's power and control. For good is the lord and truth its minister, and when it says 
that the lord put the minister in charge, that is, that good put truth in charge, the meaning in the internal sense is not that the lordship ceased to rest with that good but that it applied itself to 
the truth. For in the internal sense one perceives what a thing really is, whereas the sense of the letter presents it in the form of an appearance. The lordship always rests with good, but good applies 
itself so that truth may be joined to it. </p>
<p></p>
<p><b>[2]</b>
 While a person is governed by truth, as happens before he has been regenerated, he knows scarcely anything at all about good. For truth flows in by 
an external route, or that of the senses, whereas good flows in by an internal route. Before he has been regenerated a person is aware of that which flows in by the external route, but not of that which 
comes by the internal one. Consequently unless in that state which comes first the lordship seemed to be given to truth, that is, unless good applied itself to it, that truth could never become attached 
to this good as its own. This is the same factor as has been presented many times before - that truth seemingly occupies the first place, that is, it is so to speak the lord, while a person is 
being regenerated, but that good plainly occupies the first place and is the lord once he has been regenerated, for which see <a href="3539.htm">3539</a>, <a href="3548.htm">3548</a>, <a href="3556.htm">3556</a>, <a href="3563.htm">3563</a>, <a href="3570.htm">3570</a>, <a href="3576.htm">3576</a>, <a href="3607.htm">3607</a>, <a href="3701.htm">3701</a>, <a href="4925.htm">4925</a>, <a href="4926.htm">4926</a>, <a href="4928.htm">4928</a>, <a href="4930.htm">4930</a>.  </p>

`Et praefecit eum super domum suam': quod significet quod applicuit se ei bonum, constat ex significatione `domini', qui praefecit quod sit bonum, de qua supra n. 4973; et (c)a significatione `praeficere 
eum super domum suam' quod sit applicare se es; nempe scientifico seu vero naturali; quod hic sensus sit, patet a sequentibus ubi dicitur `quod quicquid erat illi, dederit in manum ejus', 
per quae significatur quod omne suum sicut in ejus potestate esset; bonum enim est `dominus', et verum est `minister'; </p>
<p>cum dicitur de domino quod praefecerit ministrum, seu de bono quod praefecerit 
{1}verum, in sensu interno non significatur quod cesserit ei dominium, sed quod applicuerit se, (m)nam in sensu interno percipitur res sicut illa in se est, sed in sensu litterae exponitur res secundum 
apparentiam;(n) bonum enim semper habet dominium, ast applicat se ut verum ei conjungatur:  [2] homo cum in vero est, quod fit antequam regeneratus est, tunc vix aliquid novit de bono; verum 
enim influit per viam externam seu sensualem, bonum autem per viam internam; quod influit per viam externam, hoc sentit homo, non autem quod per viam internam, priusquam regeneratus est; </p>
<p>quapropter 
nisi in priore statu daretur sicut dominium vero, seu nisi ita applicaret se bonum, nusquam bono appropriaretur verum; </p>
<p>hoc idem est cum illis quae multoties prius ostensa sunt, quod nempe verum apparenter 
primo loco sit, seu quasi `dominus' cum regeneratur homo, sed bonum manifeste primo loco {2}et `dominus' cum homo regeneratus est, de quibus videatur n. 3539, 3548, 3556, 3563, 3570, 3576,
