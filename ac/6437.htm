<h3 align="center" class="ired">属天的奥秘 第6437节</h3>
<h4 align="center"></h4><p><strong>6437.</strong>“临到他众弟兄当中拿细耳人的头顶上”表就外层而言。这从“拿细耳人的头顶”的含义和以色列儿子的代表清楚可知：“拿细耳人的头顶”是指外层事物，如下文所述；以色列的儿子，即此处的“他众弟兄”，是指属世层中的属灵真理（参看<a href="5414.htm">5414</a>，<a href="5879.htm">5879</a>，<a href="5951.htm">5951</a>节）；相对于其它真理，这些真理也是外层的。属灵教会成员处于真理之良善，该良善是一种内层良善，因为它居于属世层的内层部分。“拿细耳人”之所以表示外层事物，是因为拿细耳人代表主的神性属世层，也就是外在的神性人身。这就是拿细耳人所代表的，这一点从以下事实清楚看出来：离俗（Naziriteship）等同于头发，离俗的神圣性在于头发，这是为了已提到的代表的缘故；因为“头发”对应于并因此表示属世之物（<a href="3301.htm">3301</a>，<a href="5247.htm">5247</a>，<a href="5569.htm">5569</a>-<a href="5573.htm">5573</a>节）。这一点也从那些许愿离俗的人明显看出来，他们不可剃头发（民数记<a href="http://39-27.cn/民6.5.htm">6:5</a>）；但后来，当满了离俗的日子时，他们要在会幕门口剃头，把头发放在平安祭的火中（民数记<a href="http://39-27.cn/民6.13.htm">6:13</a>，<a href="http://39-27.cn/民6.18.htm">18</a>）。这一点从参孙进一步明显看出来，他是一个拿细耳人，他的力量就在于他的头发（士师记<a href="http://39-27.cn/士13.3.htm">13:3</a>，<a href="http://39-27.cn/士13.5.htm">5</a>；<a href="http://39-27.cn/士13.16.htm">16</a>；参看<w1>3301<w2>3301<w3>节）。正因如此，经上在耶利米书中说： <br />要剪去你离俗的头发，将它抛弃，在山岭上举哀。（耶利米书<a href="http://39-27.cn/耶7.29.htm">7:29</a>）<br />从这些经文明显可知，“拿细耳人的头顶”表示外层事物，因为拿细耳人的头顶是他的头发所在之处。这是圣言中“拿细耳人”所表示的秘密。</p>

And on the crown of the head of the Nazirite of his brethren. That this signifies as to the exteriors, is evident from the signification of the "crown of the head of a Nazirite," as being exterior things 
(of which presently); and from the representation of the sons of Israel, who here are "his brethren," as being spiritual truths in the natural (see n. 5414, 5879, 5951), which also are relatively 
exterior, for the man of the spiritual church is in the good of truth, and this good is interior, because in the interior natural. That a "Nazirite" signifies exterior things is because the Nazirites 
represented the Lord as to the Divine natural, which is the external Divine Human. That this was what they represented is evident from the fact that the Naziriteship is the hair, and that its sanctity 
consisted in the hair, which was for the sake of the representation that has been mentioned; for the hair corresponds to and hence signifies what is natural (n. 3301, 5247, 5569-5573). This is also 
plain from those who made a vow of Naziriteship, who were then forbidden to shave their hair (Num. 6:5); and afterward, when they had completed the days of the Naziriteship, they were to shave the head 
at the door of the tent, and to put the hair into the fire under the sacrifice of the peace-offering (Num. 6:13, 18). This is further evident from Samson, who was a Nazirite, in that his strength consisted 
in his hair (Judg. 13:3, 5; 16; see n. 3301). Hence it is written in Jeremiah: </p>
<p>     Cut off the hair of thy Naziriteship, and cast it away, and take up a lamentation on the hills (Jer. 7:29). From 
these passages it is evident that by the "crown of the head of a Nazirite" are signified exterior things, for the crown of the head of a Nazirite is where his hair is. This is the secret signified 
by the Nazirites in the Word. </p>

<p align="center"><b>Elliott(1983-1999) 6437</b></p><p><b>6437.</b>
'And on the crown of the head of the Nazirite among his brothers' means with respect to the exteriors. This is clear from the meaning of 'the crown of the head of the Nazirite' as the exteriors, dealt 
with below; and from the representation of the sons of Israel, to whom Joseph's 'brothers' refers here, as spiritual truths in the natural, dealt with in <a href="5414.htm">5414</a>, <a href="5879.htm">5879</a>, <a href="5951.htm">5951</a>. Which are also exterior ones 
when considered in relation to other truths. For the good that resides with the member of the spiritual Church is the good of truth, and this good is an interior one because it resides in the interior 
part of the natural. The reason why 'the Nazirite' means the exteriors is that Nazirites represented the Lord's Divine Natural, which is the External Divine Human. That this is what Nazirites represented 
is clear from the fact that naziriteship is identified with the hair, and the holiness of that state lay in the hair. It did so for the sake of the representation already mentioned; for 'the hair' 
corresponds to and consequently means the natural, see <a href="3301.htm">3301</a>, <a href="5247.htm">5247</a>, <a href="5569.htm">5569</a>-<a href="5573.htm">5573</a>. This is also evident from those who took the nazirite vow. They were forbidden to shave their hair during the time of 
the vow, Num.6:5; but afterwards, when the period of their naziriteship had been completed, they had to shave their head at the door of the tent of meeting and cast their hair into the fire under the 
eucharistic sacrifice, <a href="http://bible.gospelcom.net/cgi-bin/bible?passage=Num%206:13,%2018&amp;version=ESV&amp;interface=print&amp;showfn=yes&amp;showxref">Num 6:13, 18</a>. The same thing is further evident from Samson, who was a Nazirite. His strength lay in his hair, Judg.13:3, <a href="5.htm">5</a>; 16:1-end, see <a href="330.htm">330</a>. This is why it says in Jeremiah, </p>
<blockquote>
Cut 
off the hair of your naziriteship and throw it away, and take up a lamentation on the hills. <a href="http://bible.gospelcom.net/cgi-bin/bible?passage=Jer%207:29&amp;version=ESV&amp;interface=print&amp;showfn=yes&amp;showxref">Jer 7:29</a>. 
</blockquote>
<p>From all this it is clear that 'the crown of the head of the Nazirite' means the exteriors, 
for the crown of the Nazirite's head is where his hair is. So much for the arcanum meant in the Word by 'the Nazirites'. </p>

<p align="center"><b>Latin(1748-1756) 6437</b>
</p><b>6437.</b>
`Et vertici naziraei fratrum ejus':  quod significet quoad  exteriora, constat ex significatione `verticis naziraei' quod sint exteriora, de qua sequitur; et ex {1}repraesentatione `filiorum Israelis' 
{2}quod sint vera spiritualia in naturali, de qua n. 5414, 5879, 5951, quae etiam sunt exteriora respective, nam homo Ecclesiae spiritualis est in bono veri, et hoc bonum est interius quia in interiore 
naturali.  Quod `naziraeus' significet exteriora est quia naziraei repraesentabant Dominum quoad Divinum Naturale quod est Divinum Humanum Externum; quod `naziraei' id repraesentaverint, constat 
ex eo quod naziraeatus sit crinis, et quod sanctitas ejus (t)in crine consisteret; quod in eo consisteret, erat {3}dictae repraesentationis causa, nam `crinis' correspondet naturali ac inde significat 
naturale, videatur n. 3301, 5247, 5569-5573:  hoc quoque patet ab illis qui votum naziraeatus fecerunt, quibus tunc vetitum fuit radere crines suos, Num. vi 5, et postea cum absolverunt dies naziraeatus, 
raderent caput ad ostium tentorii, et crines mitterent in ignem sub sacrificio eucharistico, Num. vi 13, 18.  Hoc quoque adhuc patet a Simsone, qui naziraeus fuit; quod robur ejus consisteret in 
crinibus, Jud. xiii 3, 5, xvi 1 ad fin., videatur n. 3301; inde apud Jeremiam,  Abscinde crines tui naziraeatus, et abjice, et tolle super collibus  lamentum, vii 29. Ex his {4}constat quod per `verticem 
naziraei' significentur exteriora, vertex naziraei enim est ubi crinis (c)illius.  Hoc arcanum est quod per naziraeos in Verbo significatur. </p>
