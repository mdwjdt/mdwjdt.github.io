<h3 align="center" class="ired">属天的奥秘 第4278节</h3>
<h4 align="center"></h4><p><strong>4278.</strong>“雅各的大腿窝正在同那人摔跤的时候就扭了”表真理尚未拥有完全与良善结合的能力。这从“扭了”的含义清楚可知，就是这种情况：真理尚未以这种次序被排列，即：它们连同良善全都进入属天-属灵良善（参看下面31节经文的解释）。因此意思是，真理尚未拥有完全与良善结合的能力；因为“大腿窝”表示各种良善结合的地方，如刚才所述（<a href="4277.htm">4277</a>节）。</p>

<p align="center"><b>Potts(1905-1910) 4278</b></p><p><b>4278.</b>
And the hollow of Jacob's thigh was out of joint in his wrestling with him. That this signifies that as yet truth had not the power of completely conjoining itself with good, is evident from the signification 
of being "out of joint," namely, that truths had not as yet been disposed in such an order that they all, together with good, could enter into celestial spiritual good (see the explication that 
follows at the thirty-first verse), consequently that truth had not yet the power of completely conjoining itself with good; for the "hollow of the thigh" denotes where goods are conjoined together 
(as said just above, n. 4277). </p>

<p align="center"><b>Elliott(1983-1999) 4278</b></p><p><b>4278.</b>
'And the hollow of Jacob's thigh was out of joint as he wrestled with him' means that truth did not as yet have the power to join itself completely to good. This is clear from the meaning of 'being out 
of joint' as a situation in which truths have not yet been arranged into such an order that together with good they could all enter celestial-spiritual good, dealt with in the explanation at verse 31 below. The meaning as a consequence is that truth did not as yet have the power to join itself completely to good, for 'the hollow of the thigh' means the place where different kinds of good are joined 
together, as stated immediately above in <a href="4277.htm">4277</a>. </p>

<p align="center"><b>Latin(1748-1756) 4278</b>
</p><b>4278.</b>
`Et luxata vola femoris Jacobi in luctando illo cum eo': </p>
<p>quod significet quod nondum potentia veri bono conjungendi se prorsus, constat ex significatione `luxari' quod sit quod nondum vera in illum 
ordinem disposita sint ut omnia simul cum bono intrare possent bonum caeleste spirituale, de qua in explicatione ad vers. seq. 31; proinde quod non potentia veri bono se conjungendi prorsus; `vola 
enim femoris' est ubi conjunguntur bona, ut mox supra n. 4277 dictum. </p>
