<h3 align="center" class="ired">属天的奥秘 第8152节</h3>
<h4 align="center"></h4><p><strong>8152.</strong>“他就追袭以色列人”表企图征服或掌控那些处于与仁结合之信的人。这从“追袭”的含义和“以色列人”的代表清楚可知：“追袭”是指征服或掌控的企图（<a href="8136.htm">8136</a>节）；“以色列人”是指那些属于属灵教会的人，如前面频繁所述，因而是指那些处于与仁结合之信的人，因为属灵教会成员在教义和生活上都处于这信。信之良善，或仁爱，是本质要素，因而在那些属于真正的属灵教会之人中间占据首位。但在那些信在教义和生活上都与其良善分离的人中间，信之真理或信本身是本质要素，或占据首位。后者不属该教会，因为构成教会的，是生活，而不是教义，除非这教义应用于生活。由此明显可知，主的教会不在这里，也不在那里，而是在凡人们照仁之诫命生活的地方，既在教会所在国家之内，也在它们之外。正因如此，主的教会分散在全世界，然而却是一个；因为当构成教会的，是生活，而非脱离生活的教义时，教会就是一个。但当教义构成教会时，教会就有许多个。</p>

And he pursued after the sons of Israel. That this signifies an attempt to subjugate those who were in faith conjoined with charity, is evident from the signification of "pursuing," as being an attempt 
to subjugate (n. 8136); and from the representation of the sons of Israel, as being those who are of the spiritual church (as frequently above), thus who are in faith conjoined with charity, for they 
who are of this church are in this faith both as to doctrine and as to life. The good of faith, or charity, is the essential, thus is in the first place, with those who are of the genuine spiritual 
church; whereas with those with whom faith is separate from its good, both as to doctrine and as to life, the truth of faith, or faith itself, is the essential, or in the first place. These do not belong 
to this church, for the life makes the church; but not doctrine, except insofar as it becomes of the life. For this reason it is plain that the church of the Lord is not here, nor there, but that 
it is everywhere, both within those kingdoms where the church is, and out of them, where men live according to the precepts of charity. Hence it is that the church of the Lord is scattered through the 
whole world, and yet that it is a one; for when the life makes the church, and not doctrine separate from life, then the church is a one; but when doctrine makes the church, then there are many. </p>

<p align="center"><b>Elliott(1983-1999) 8152</b></p><p><b>8152.</b>
'And he pursued the children of Israel' means the attempt to bring under his control those governed by faith bonded to charity. This is clear from the meaning of 'pursuing' as the attempt to bring under 
one's control, as in <a href="8136.htm">8136</a>; and from the representation of 'the children of Israel' as those who belong to the spiritual Church, dealt with often, thus those governed by faith bonded to charity. For 
members of that Church are governed by this faith both in doctrine and in life. The good of faith, which is charity, is the essential element, and so occupies first place with those who belong to the 
genuine spiritual Church. But with those with whom faith is separated from the good of faith both in doctrine and in life the truth of faith, or simply faith, is the essential element or occupies first 
place. The latter are not members of that Church, for life constitutes the Church, not doctrine except in the measure that it becomes applicable to life. From this it is evident that the Lord's Church 
is not in this particular location or in that, but that it resides wherever people lead lives in keeping with the commandments of charity, both within the kingdoms in which the Church exists and 
outside them. So it is that the Lord's Church is spread throughout the whole world, and yet is one; for when life constitutes the Church, and not doctrine separated from life, there is one Church But 
when doctrine constitutes the Church there are many. </p>

`Et persecutus post filios Israelis': quod significet conatum subjugandi illos qui in fide conjuncta charitati, constat ex significatione {1}`persequi' quod sit conatus subjugandi, ut n. 8136; et ex 
repraesentatione `filiorum Israelis' quod sint qui ab Ecclesia spirituali, de qua saepius; ita qui in fide conjuncta charitati; nam qui ab illa Ecclesia sunt in illa fide tam {2}quoad doctrinam quam 
quoad vitam sunt; bonum fidei seu charitas est essentiale, ita primo loco, illis qui ab Ecclesia genuina spirituali; {3}ast quibus fides separata a bono ejus {4}tam quoad doctrinam quam quoad vitam, est 
verum fidei seu fides essentiale seu primo loco; {5}hi non sunt ab Ecclesia illa, nam vita facit Ecclesiam, non autem doctrina nisi quantum haec fit vitae; inde patet quod Ecclesia Domini non sit hic 
aut ibi, sed quod sit ubivis tam intra illa regna ubi Ecclesia quam extra illa, ubi vivitur secundum praecepta charitatis; inde est quod Ecclesia Domini sit per universum orbem {6}sparsa, et tamen 
quod una sit; cum enim vita facit Ecclesiam et non doctrina separata a vita, tunc Ecclesia una est, at cum doctrina facit Ecclesiam, tunc plures sunt. 	@1 persequendi$ 	@2 doctrina quam vita$ 	@3 at$ 	@4 
et doctrina et vita$ 	@5 illi$ 	@6 et quod una sit non plures$ </p>
