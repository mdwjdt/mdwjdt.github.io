<h3 align="center" class="ired">属天的奥秘 第592节</h3>
<h4 align="center"></h4><p><strong>592.</strong>“耶和华说，我要除灭人”意思是人将毁灭自己。这一点从前面的解释，即对断言耶和华或主惩罚、试探、降灾、除灭或杀戮、诅咒的解读明显可知。例如，耶和华杀了犹大的长子珥和次子俄南（创世记<a href="http://39-27.cn/创38.7.htm">38:7</a>）；耶和华击杀了埃及地所有的长子（出埃及记<a href="http://39-27.cn/出12.10.htm">12:10</a>，<a href="http://39-27.cn/出12.29.htm">29</a>）。以及耶利米书：<br />我在怒气和忿怒中所杀的人。（耶利米书<a href="http://39-27.cn/耶33.5.htm">33:5</a>）<br />诗篇：<br />他放出猛烈的怒气和忿怒、恼恨、苦难，成了一群降灾的使者。（诗篇<a href="http://39-27.cn/诗78.49.htm">78:49</a>）<br />阿摩司书：<br />灾祸若临到一城，岂非耶和华所降的吗？（阿摩司书<a href="http://39-27.cn/摩3.6.htm">3:6</a>）<br />启示录：<br />盛满了活到永永远远之神大怒的七个金碗。（启示录<a href="http://39-27.cn/启15.1.htm">15:1</a>，<a href="http://39-27.cn/启15.7.htm">7</a>；<a href="http://39-27.cn/启16.1.htm">16:1</a>）<br />所有这些事都被归到耶和华身上，尽管完全违背祂的本性。由于前面解释的原因，它们被归到耶和华身上，也是为了让人们对于主统管和治理一切事物（无论总体还是细节）先形成一个总体观念，然后认识到主从不降灾，更别说杀人，而是人自招灾祸，毁灭并杀死自己。从某种意义上说，并非人做的，而是恶灵煽动并引领他；然而事实上也是人，因为他相信他所做的一切都是自己做的。所以，此处说耶和华将除灭人，事实是人将摧毁和除灭自己。<br />②在来生（灵界）活在痛苦和地狱之人身上，这种情况变得非常明显。他们不停地报怨，将带来惩罚的所有邪恶都归咎于主。在灵界，有些恶灵以伤害和惩罚他人为乐，甚至成了他们最大的乐趣；那些受到伤害和惩罚的人以为是主派来的。但他们被告知，也向他们表明，没有一丝恶来自主，而是他们自招的；在来生（灵界），一切都处于这样一种状态和平衡，即恶行会报应给施恶者，他会变成带来惩罚的邪恶，因此惩罚是不可避免的。据说允许是为了纠正恶；然而主总是将带来惩罚的所有邪恶转变为良善；因此出自主的无非是善。然而迄今为止，没人知道何为许可；以为凡允许的事就是经主许可、由祂所做的事，因为祂许可了。但事实迥然不同，对此，蒙主慈悲，容后再述。</p>

<p><strong>[NCE]592.</strong> The meaning of Jehovah said, "I will obliterate the human" as the fact that humanity would annihilate itself is established by what was said above [<a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_592/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_588" target=_top>588</a>]. That is, Jehovah (the Lord) is described as punishing, testing, doing evil, destroying or killing, and cursing. For instance, Jehovah is said to have killed Er, Judah's firstborn, and Onan, his second (<a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_592/bible_king-james-version_genesis_38_7" target=_top>Genesis 38:7</a>, <a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_592/bible_king-james-version_genesis_38_10" target=_top>10</a>), and all the firstborn of Egypt (<a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_592/bible_king-james-version_exodus_12_12" target=_top>Exodus 12:12</a>, <a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_592/bible_king-james-version_exodus_12_29" target=_top>29</a>). Jeremiah has an example:<br />... whom I have struck in my anger and in my wrath. (<a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_592/bible_king-james-version_jeremiah_33_5" target=_top>Jeremiah 33:5</a>)<br />In David:<br />He sent against them the wrath of his anger, his ire, and fury, and anguish, a delegation of evil angels. (<a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_592/bible_king-james-version_psalms_78_49" target=_top>Psalms 78:49</a>)<br />In Amos:<br />Will there be evil in the city and Jehovah did not do it? (<a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_592/bible_king-james-version_amos_3_6" target=_top>Amos 3:6</a>)<br />In John:<br />... seven golden bowls full of the anger of God, who lives forever and ever. (<a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_592/bible_king-james-version_revelation_15_1" target=_top>Revelation 15:1</a>, <a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_592/bible_king-james-version_revelation_15_7" target=_top>7</a>; <a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_592/bible_king-james-version_revelation_16_1" target=_top>16:1</a>)<br />All of these banes are said to be from Jehovah, even though the truth is the exact opposite.<br />The reason they are attributed to him was given above [<a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_592/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_588" target=_top>588-589</a>]. A further purpose is to allow people to form first the very general idea that the Lord controls and arranges absolutely everything. Later they can learn that nothing bad comes from the Lord, least of all murder, but that we humans are the ones who bring evil on ourselves and destroy and kill ourselves. Still, it is not we who do so but evil spirits who goad us and lead us on; and yet it is we who do so after all, because we fully believe it is.<br />This is the reason, then, that the present verse says Jehovah would obliterate the human, when truly it is humans who destroyed and annihilated themselves.<br />[2] The actual situation is especially clear from those in the other life who undergo the tortures of hell. They are constantly weeping and blaming the Lord for all the negative consequences of their punishment. Those evil spirits in the realm of evil spirits who take pleasure — their greatest pleasure — in hurting and punishing others lay the blame in the same place. The ones they wound and discipline think it is the Lord who does so, but I told them and showed them that absolutely nothing bad comes from the Lord. "On the contrary," I said, "you bring the evil on yourselves.<br />"The way all things in this other life are arranged and balanced, evil rebounds on the evildoer and turns into the miseries of punishment. This evil cannot be helped. It is described as being tolerated — tolerated for the sake of evil's cure. But the Lord still converts all the negative consequences of punishment into good, so that nothing but goodness ever comes from him."<br />What this kind of toleration is no one yet realizes. People view the thing that is tolerated as having been carried out by the One who allows it, simply because he allows it. The reality, though, is quite different, as will be explained later [<a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_592/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_2447" target=_top>2447</a>], with the Lord's divine mercy. </p>

Jehovah said, I will destroy man. That this signifies that man would extinguish himself, is evident from what has been explained before, namely, that it is predicated of Jehovah or the Lord that He punishes, 
that He tempts, that He does evil, that He destroys or kills, and that He curses. As for example, that He slew Er, Judah's firstborn; and Onan, another son of Judah (Gen. 38:7, 10); that Jehovah 
smote all the firstborn of Egypt (Exod. 12:12, 29). And so in Jeremiah: </p>
<p>     Whom I have slain in Mine anger and in My wrath (Jer. 33:5). In David: </p>
<p>     He cast upon them the wrath of His anger; 
vehement anger, and fury and straitness, a sending of evil angels (Ps. 78:49). In Amos: </p>
<p>     Shall evil befall a city, and Jehovah hath not done it? (Amos 3:6). In John: </p>
<p>     Seven golden vials full 
of the wrath of God who liveth forever and ever (Rev. 15:1, 7; 16:1).All these things are predicated of Jehovah, although entirely contrary to His nature. They are predicated of Him for the reason 
explained before; and also in order that men may first form the very general idea that the Lord governs and disposes all things both in general and in particular; and may afterwards learn that nothing 
of evil is from the Lord, much less does He kill; but that it is man who brings evil upon himself, and ruins and destroys himself-although it is not man, but evil spirits who excite and lead him; and 
yet it is man, because he believes that he is himself the doer. So now here it is said of Jehovah that He would "destroy man" when in fact it was man who would destroy and extinguish himself.  [2] 
The state of the case may be very evident from those in the other life who are in torment and in hell, and who are continually lamenting and attributing all the evil of punishment to the Lord. So in the 
world of evil spirits there are those who make it their delight, even their greatest delight, to hurt and punish others; and those who are hurt and punished think it is from the Lord. But they are 
told, and it is shown them, that not the least of evil is from the Lord, but they bring it upon themselves; for such is the state and such the equilibrium of all things in the other life that evil returns 
upon him who does evil, and becomes the evil of punishment; and for the same reason it is inevitable. This is said to be permitted for the sake of the amendment of the evil. But still the Lord turns 
all the evil of punishment into good; so that there is never anything but good from the Lord. But hitherto no one has known what permission is; what is permitted is believed to be done by Him who 
permits, because He permits. But the fact is quite otherwise, concerning which, of the Lord's Divine mercy hereafter. </p>

<p align="center"><b>Elliott(1983-1999) 592</b></p><p><b>592.</b>
'Jehovah said, I will wipe out man' means that man would bring about his own end. This is clear from what has been stated already, that is to say, about statements made to the effect that Jehovah or 
the Lord punishes, tempts, does evil, wipes out or slays, and curses; for example, the statement that Jehovah slew Er, Judah's firstborn, and Onan, Judah's second son, <a href="http://bible.gospelcom.net/cgi-bin/bible?passage=Gen%2038:7&amp;version=ESV&amp;interface=print&amp;showfn=yes&amp;showxref">Gen 38:7</a>, to; or the statement 
that Jehovah smote all the firstborn of Egypt, <a href="http://bible.gospelcom.net/cgi-bin/bible?passage=Exod%2012:10,%2029&amp;version=ESV&amp;interface=print&amp;showfn=yes&amp;showxref">Exod 12:10, 29</a>. Also in Jeremiah,  </p>
<blockquote>
Those whom I smote in My anger, and in My fierce anger. <a href="http://bible.gospelcom.net/cgi-bin/bible?passage=Jer%2033:5&amp;version=ESV&amp;interface=print&amp;showfn=yes&amp;showxref">Jer 33:5</a>. 
</blockquote>
<p>In David, </p>
<blockquote>
He let loose on them His fierce 
anger, exceeding anger, and rage, and distress, a mission of evil angels. <a href="http://bible.gospelcom.net/cgi-bin/bible?passage=Ps%2078:49&amp;version=ESV&amp;interface=print&amp;showfn=yes&amp;showxref">Ps 78:49</a>.   
</blockquote>
In Amos,  </p>
<blockquote>
Will evil befall a city, and Jehovah has not done it? <a href="http://bible.gospelcom.net/cgi-bin/bible?passage=Amos%203:6&amp;version=ESV&amp;interface=print&amp;showfn=yes&amp;showxref">Amos 3:6</a>.  
</blockquote>
<p>In John,  </p>
<blockquote>
Seven golden bowls 
full of the anger of God who lives for ever and ever. <a href="http://bible.gospelcom.net/cgi-bin/bible?passage=Rev%2015:1,%207;%2016:1&amp;version=ESV&amp;interface=print&amp;showfn=yes&amp;showxref">Rev 15:1, 7; 16:1</a>. 
</blockquote>
<p>All of these qualities are attributed to Jehovah when in fact He is quite the reverse of them. They are attributed to Him 
for the reason already given, and also so that people may grasp first of all the very general idea that the Lord rules over and disposes every single thing there is. Then after that they may grasp 
the idea that the Lord never does evil, let alone slays anyone, but that instead it is man who brings evil upon himself, destroys, and slays himself. In one sense it is not man who does so but the evil 
spirits who incite him and lead him on. Yet in reality it is the man, for what else does he believe than that he himself does what he does? So then it is here said of Jehovah that He would wipe out 
man, though in fact it was man who would destroy himself and bring about his own end.  </p>
<p></p>
<p><b>[2]</b>
 The situation in this matter becomes particularly clear from those in the next life who are living in torment 
and in hell. They are constantly complaining and ascribing to the Lord all the evil that punishes. And so do evil spirits in the world of evil spirits who take delight, indeed it is their chief delight, 
in hurting and punishing others. And those who are being hurt and punished assume that it is sent by the Lord. They are told and shown that not a hint of evil comes from the Lord, but that they 
bring the evil upon themselves. For in the next life all is counterbalanced in such a way that evil recoils on the one who commits it, and becomes evil that punishes. Punishment is therefore inevitable. 
It is said to be permitted for the sake of correcting evil; yet all the time the Lord is converting all evil that punishes into good, with the result that nothing but good ever comes from the Lord. 
What permission is however nobody as yet knows. What is permitted is considered to be something done by Him who permits simply because He does permit it. But in reality the situation is altogether different, 
a subject which in the Lord's Divine mercy will be dealt with later on.  </p>

Quod 'dixerit Jehovah, Delebo hominem' significet quod homo se exstingueret, constat ab illis quae prius dicta sunt, quod nempe praedicetur de Jehovah seu Domino quod puniat, quod tentet, quod malum 
faciat, quod deleat seu occidat, quod maledicat; sicut quod Jehovah occiderit Erum primogenitum Jehudae; et {x}Onanem alterum filium Jehudae, Gen. xxxviii 7, 10; quod Jehovah necaverit omnem primogenitum 
Aegypti, Exod. xii 12, 29; sicut apud Jeremiam, 	Quos percussi in ira Mea, et in excandescentia Mea, xxxiii 5: </p>
<p>apud Davidem, 	Misit in eos excandescentiam irae Suae, iram vehementem, et furorem, 
et angustiam, immissionem angelorum malorum, Ps. lxxviii 49: </p>
<p>apud Amosum, 	Num erit malum in urbe, et Jehovah non fecit? iii 6: </p>
<p>apud Johannem, 	Septem phialae aureae plenae ira Dei viventis in 
saecula saeculorum, Apoc. xv 1, 7; xvi 1; </p>
<p>quae omnia praedicantur de Jehovah, tametsi prorsus contrarium est: quod praedicentur, causa est, de qua prius; tum etiam ut communissimam ideam primum capiant 
quod Dominus regat et disponat omnia et singula; at postea quod nihil mali a Domino, minus quod occidat; sed quod homo sit qui sibimet malum inferat, semetque perdat et occidat; tametsi non est homo 
sed sunt mali spiritus, qui eum excitant et ducunt; sed est homo, quia non aliter credit quam quod ipse. Ita nunc hic quod praedicetur de Jehovah, quod deleret hominem, cum tamen homo esset qui semet 
perdidit et exstinxit.  [2] Quomodo se res habet, imprimis constare potest ab illis in altera vita qui in cruciatu et inferno sunt, qui continue lamentantur, et omne malum poenae tribuunt Domino; similiter 
spiritus mali in mundo spirituum malorum qui jucundum, immo jucundissimum suum ponunt in eo ut alios laedant et puniant; qui laeduntur et puniuntur, putant a Domino; quibus dictum et ostensum 
quod ne hilum mali a Domino sed quod ii sibimet ipsis malum inferant; nam talis status et tale aequilibrium omnium est in altera vita ut malum redeat ad illum qui malum facit, et fit malum poenae; et 
quod non possit aliter quam existere; quod vocatur permitti, ex causa emendationis mali; sed usque Dominus vertit omne malum poenae in bonum sic ut nihil usquam nisi bonum a Domino.  Verum quid 'permissio,' 
nemo adhuc novit: quod permittitur, putatur fieri ab Ipso qui permittit, quia permittit; sed res se prorsus aliter habet, de qua, ex Divina Domini Misericordia, in sequentibus. </p>
