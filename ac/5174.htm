<h3 align="center" class="ired">属天的奥秘 第5174节</h3>
<h4 align="center"></h4><p><strong>5174.</strong>众所周知，食物在胃里以多种方式被搅动，以便它的内在元素能被提取出来，服务于功用，也就是进入循环，然后进入血液；食物在肠内会进一步被搅动。这种搅动由灵人所经历的最初搅动来代表，各自所受的搅动取决于他们在世上所过的生活，以便邪恶能被分离出去，良善被收集起来以服务于功用。因此，就灵魂或灵而言，可以说在死后或从身体被释放出来后不久，他们首先可以说进入胃部区域，在那里被搅动和净化。那些经毫无成效的搅动后，邪恶在里面占据主导地位的人就通过胃被输送到肠道，一直到肠道末端，即结肠和直肠。他们从那里被排泄出去，落入茅厕，也就是地狱。但那些良善在里面占据主导地位的人经过一些搅动和净化后，便转化为乳糜，被输送至血液；有的经历很长的途径，有的经历很短的途径；有的经历强烈的搅动，有的经历轻微的搅动，有的几乎不经历任何搅动。那些几乎不经历任何搅动的人表现为食物的汁液，这些汁液立刻被吸收，通过静脉被输送至体内的血液循环，甚至进入脑部，等等。</p>

It is known that the food in the stomach is agitated in many ways, in order that its inner elements may be extracted, and may serve for use, that is, may pass into chyle, and then into blood; and that 
it is further agitated in the intestines. Such agitations are represented by the first agitations of spirits, which all take place according to their life in the world, in order that evils may be separated, 
and goods gathered to serve for use; and therefore it may be said of souls or spirits that shortly after death or release from the body, they come first as it were into the region of the stomach, 
and are there agitated and purified. They in whom evils have obtained the ascendancy, after being agitated with no good result, are conveyed through the stomach into the intestines, even to the last, 
which are the colon and rectum, and thence are cast forth into the privy, that is, into hell. But they in whom goods have had the ascendancy, after some agitations and purifications become chyle, 
and pass into the blood, some by a longer and some by a shorter way, some being agitated severely, some gently, and some scarcely at all. These last are represented in the food juices which are at once 
imbibed by the veins and carried into the circulation, even into the brain; and so on. </p>

<p align="center"><b>Elliott(1983-1999) 5174</b></p><p><b>5174.</b>
It is well known that food in the stomach is subjected to many processes which harry it so that its essential nourishment - which goes on to perform some useful purpose, that is, which passes into the 
chyle and then into the blood - may be extracted from it, after which it undergoes further processing in the intestines. Harryings of this kind are represented by the initial harryings that spirits 
undergo - every one of which is determined by the lives they led in the world - so that evils may be separated and the forms of good which have some useful purpose to perform may be gathered together. 
So far as souls or spirits are concerned therefore, it may be said that a little while after their departure or release from the body they come first so to speak into the region of the stomach where 
they are harried and purified. After those with whom evils have gained predominance have been harried to no avail they are conveyed through the stomach into the intestines, right on to the end of them 
- to the colon and the rectum. From there they are excreted into the latrine, which is hell. But those with whom forms of good have gained predominance are converted, after several experiences involving 
harrying and purification, into chyle and pass on into the blood, some by a longer route, others by a shorter one. Some are subjected to harsh harrying experiences, others to mild ones, and some to 
scarcely any whatever. Those subjected to scarcely any are represented in the food-juices that are absorbed instantly through the veins into the bloodstream, even into the brain, and so on. </p>

</p><b>5174.</b>
Quod alimenta seu cibi in ventriculo multis modis vexentur, ut eliciantur eorum interiora, quae cedant usui, nempe quae abeant in chylum, et dein in sanguinem, notum est, etiam quod dein in intestinis 
tales vexationes repraesentantur per primas vexationes spirituum, quae omnes fiunt secundum vitam eorum in mundo, ut separentur mala et colligantur bona quae cedant usui; quapropter de animabus 
seu spiritibus, aliquantum post decessum seu solutionem a corpore, dici potest quod quasi primum in regionem ventriculi veniant et ibi vexentur et purificentur; apud quos mala praedominium obtinuerunt, 
illi postquam incassum vexati sunt, per ventriculum feruntur in intestina, et usque ad ultima, nempe ad colon et rectum, et inde excernuntur in latrinam, hoc est, in infernum; at apud quos bona 
praedominium habuerunt, illi post aliquot vexationes et purificationes fiunt chylus, et abeunt in sanguinem {1}, quidam per longiorem viam, quidam per breviorem, et quidam vexantur ruditer, quidam 
leniter, et quidam vix quicquam; hi qui vix quicquam, repraesentantur in ciborum succis, qui statim imbibuntur a venis, et feruntur in circulum, usque in cerebrum, et sic porro. @1 i et sic usum 
praestant$ </p>
