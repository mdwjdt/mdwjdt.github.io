<h3 align="center" class="ired">属天的奥秘 第5492节</h3>
<h4 align="center"></h4><p><strong>5492.</strong>“他们就把他们的谷子驮在驴上”表真理被收集到记忆知识里。这从“谷子”和“驴”的含义清楚可知：“谷子”是指真理（参看<a href="5276.htm">5276</a>，<a href="5280.htm">5280</a>，<a href="5292.htm">5292</a>，<a href="5402.htm">5402</a>节）；“驴”是指记忆知识（<a href="2781.htm">2781</a>节）。由此可知“他们就把他们的谷子驮在驴上”表示真理被收集到记忆知识里。在心思专注于字面上的历史意义之人看来，这些话的这种意义似乎显得很奇怪；如果除了离文字很近并从文字中闪耀出来的意义外，他不相信任何内义的存在，这种意义甚至显得更奇怪。因为这种人会对自己说，“把谷子驮在驴上”怎么可能表示被收集到记忆知识中的真理呢？但要让他知道，圣言的字义在从人传到天使那里，也就是进入天堂时，会逐渐变成灵义。事实上，它在进入至内层或第三层天堂时，会逐渐变成更陌生的意义，因为在那里，圣言的每一个细节都逐渐变成属于爱与仁的情感，内义则作为一个层面而服务于这层意义，或也可说，是这层意义止于其上的根基。<br />圣言的历史在被提升到天堂时，会逐渐变成另外一层意义；这一事实在运用理性得出结论，并对属世之物与属灵之物有所了解的人看来是显而易见的。他能看出，“把谷子驮在驴上”是一种纯属世行为，里面绝没有任何属灵之物；他还能看出，天堂或灵界里的天使若不以属灵的方式，就无法理解这些话；当理解它们的对应物而非它们时，也就是说，当理解教会的真理而非“谷子”，理解存在于属世层中的记忆知识而非“驴”时，他们就是在以属灵的方式理解这些话。在圣言中，“驴”表示服务的事物，因而表示记忆知识，因为这些就是相对于属灵观念，以及理性概念来说起服务作用的事物（参看l<a href="2781.htm">2781</a>节）。由此也可以看出，与世人的思维和言语相比，天使的思维和言语是什么样。也就是说，天使的思维和言语是属灵的，而世人的思维和言语是属世的；并且当天使的思维和言语降下时，它们会逐渐变成世人的思维和言语；当世人的思维和言语上升时，它们则转换为天使的思维和言语。若非这样，人类与天使之间，即世界与天使之间根本不会有任何交流。</p>

And they lifted their produce upon their asses. That this signifies that truths were gathered into memory-knowledges, is evident from the signification of "produce," as being truth (see n. 5276, 5280, 
5292, 5402); and from the signification of an "ass," as being memory-knowledge (n. 2781). Hence it follows that by their "lifting their produce upon their asses," is signified that truths were gathered 
into memory-knowledges. That this is the signification of these words seems strange to him who keeps his mind in the historic sense of the letter, especially if he believes that there is no other 
internal sense than that which proximately shines forth from the letter; for he says to himself, How can lifting produce upon their asses signify truths gathered into memory-knowledges? But let him know 
that the literal sense of the Word passes into such a spiritual sense when it passes from man to the angels, or into heaven, and even into a still more remote sense when it passes into the inmost heaven, 
where all and each of the things of the Word pass into affections which are of love and charity, to which sense the internal sense serves as a plane.  [2] That the historicals of the Word pass 
into another sense when they are elevated into heaven, may be seen by the man who concludes from reason, and who knows anything about the natural and the spiritual. He can see that to lift produce upon 
their asses is a purely natural act, and that there is nothing spiritual in it whatever; and he can also see that the angels who are in heaven, or they who are in the spiritual world, cannot apprehend 
these words otherwise than spiritually, and that they are apprehended spiritually when in their place are understood their correspondences, namely, the truth of the church in place of "produce," and 
the memory-knowledges that are in the natural in place of "asses." That by "asses" in the Word are signified things that serve, and thus memory-knowledges (for these are things that serve relatively 
to things spiritual and also to things rational), may be seen explained at n. 2781. Hence also it is plain what angelic thought and speech are relatively to man's thought and speech-that angelic thought 
and speech are spiritual, but man's natural; and that the former falls into the latter when it descends, and that the latter is turned into the former when it ascends. Unless this were so, there 
would be no communication whatever of man with angels, or of the world with heaven. </p>

'And they loaded their corn onto their asses' means the truths gathered into factual knowledge. This is clear from the meaning of corn' as truth, dealt with in <a href="5276.htm">5276</a>, <a href="5280.htm">5280</a>, <a href="5292.htm">5292</a>, <a href="5402.htm">5402</a>; and from the meaning 
of 'ass' as factual knowledge, dealt with in <a href="2781.htm">2781</a>. From these meanings it follows that 'they loaded their corn onto their asses' means that truths were gathered into factual knowledge. Such a meaning 
of these words will seem strange to someone who fixes his mind on the historical sense of the letter. It will seem even stranger to him if he does not believe in the existence of any internal sense 
other than the one which lies in close proximity to and shines out of the letter. For that person will say to himself, How can 'loading corn onto their asses' mean truths gathered into factual knowledge? 
But let him know that in the Word the sense of the letter passes into a sense of a spiritual kind when it passes from man to the angels, that is, into heaven. Indeed it passes into a sense stranger 
still when it passes into the third heaven, where every single detail in the Word passes into affections belonging to love and charity, which the internal sense serves as the foundation for it to 
rest upon. </p>
<p></p>
<p><b>[2]</b>
 The fact that the historical descriptions in the Word move away into another sense when they are raised into heaven may become clear to anyone who uses his reason to draw conclusions 
and who knows something about the natural and the spiritual. He can see that 'loading corn onto their asses' is a purely natural action and has absolutely nothing spiritual about it. He can also see 
that angels in heaven, that is, in a spiritual world, cannot grasp those words in any but a spiritual manner and that they do grasp them in a spiritual manner when corresponding entities are understood 
in place of them, that is to say, when they understand truth known to the Church in place of 'corn' and facts present in the natural in place of 'asses'. It has been shown previously that in the Word 
'asses' means objects of service and so known facts, for in relation to spiritual ideas and also to rational concepts such facts are objects of service, see <a href="2781.htm">2781</a>. From all this one may also see what 
the thought and speech of angels are like compared with men's thought and speech. That is to say, one may see that angels' thought and speech are spiritual whereas men's are natural, and that when 
angels' thought and speech move downwards they pass into men's, and that men's are converted into angels' when they move upwards. If this were not so there would not be any communication at all between 
mankind and the angels, that is, between the world and heaven. </p>

`Et sustulerunt annonam suam super asinos suos': quod significet vera collata in scientifica, constat ex significatione `annonae' quod sit verum, de qua n. 5276, 5280, 5292, 5402; et ex significatione 
`asini' quod sit scientificum, de qua n. 2781; inde sequitur quod per `sustulerunt annonam suam super asinos suos' significetur quod vera collata in scientifica. Quod significatio horum verborum haec 
sit, apparet alienum ei qui mentem in sensu litterae historico tenet, et magis {1}si sensum alium internum quam qui proxime elucet ex littera, dari non credit; dicet enim secum, Quomodo `tollere annonam 
super asinos suos' potest significare vera collata in scientifica? sed sciat quod sensus litterae Verbi in sensum talem spiritualem transeat cum ab homine ad angelos seu in caelum, immo in magis 
adhuc alienum cum in caelum intimum, ubi omnia et singula Verbi in affectiones quae sunt amoris et charitatis, transeunt, cui pro plano inservit sensus internus; [2]quod historica Verbi in alium sensum 
abeant cum elevantur in caelum, constare potest ei qui ex ratione concludit, et qui aliquid novit de naturali et de spirituali; is videre potest quod `tollere annonam super asinos suos' sit pure naturale, 
et quod prorsus non ibi sit aliquid spirituale; et quoque videre potest quod angeli qui in caelo seu qui in spirituali mundo sunt, non possint aliter capere illa verba quam spiritualiter, et quod 
spiritualiter capiantur cum correspondentiae loco illorum intelliguntur, nempe verum Ecclesiae pro `annona', et scientifica quae in naturali pro `asinis'; quod per `asinos' in Verbo significentur 
servitia, (2)ita scientifica, nam haec sunt servitia respective ad spiritualia et quoque ad rationalia, ostensum, videatur n. 2781; inde patet quoque qualis est cogitatio et loquela angelica respective 
ad cogitationem et loquelam humanam, nempe quod illa cogitatio et loquela sit spiritualis, haec autem naturalis; et quod illa in hanc cadat cum descendit, et quod haec in illam vertatur cum ascendit; 
nisi ita foret, nullatenus aliqua communicatio foret hominis cum angelis, seu mundi cum caelo. @1 qui$  @2 ita quae, in naturali homine sunt, proinde scientifica, respective ad illa quae in spirituali,$ </p>
