<h3 align="center" class="ired">属天的奥秘 第6015节</h3>
<h4 align="center"></h4><p><strong>6015.</strong>“就用法老为接雅各所送来的车辆”表从教会的记忆知识所获得的教义。这从“车辆”的含义和“法老”的代表清楚可知：“车辆”是指教义事物（参看<a href="5945.htm">5945</a>节）；“法老”是指总体上教会的记忆知识，因为“埃及”表示教会的记忆知识（<a href="1462.htm">1462</a>，<a href="4749.htm">4749</a>，<a href="4964.htm">4964</a>，<a href="4966.htm">4966</a>节），因此，“埃及王”表示总体的记忆知识，他在圣言的别处也是如此，但在大多数经文中，“埃及”，以及“法老”都表示败坏的记忆知识。“法老”代表总体上的记忆知识，这一点明显可见于以赛亚书：<br />琐安的首领极其愚昧；法老大有智慧的谋士所筹划的成为愚谋。你们怎敢对法老说，我是智慧人的子孙，我是古王的子孙呢？（以赛亚书<a href="http://39-27.cn/赛19.11.htm">19:11</a>）<br />此处“法老”表示总体上教会的记忆知识，这就是为何他被称为“智慧人”和“古王的子孙”；“智慧人”和“古王”表示古教会所拥有的真理。不过，此处是指这类知识变成愚昧，因为经上说“琐安的首领极其愚昧；所筹划的成为愚谋”。<br /><br />他们起身下埃及去，并没有求问我的口；要靠法老的力量坚固自己，并投在埃及的荫下。所以法老的力量必作你们的羞辱；投在埃及的荫下必成为耻辱。（以赛亚书<a href="http://39-27.cn/赛30.2.htm">30:2</a>，<a href="http://39-27.cn/赛30.3.htm">3</a>）<br />“要靠法老的力量坚固自己，并投在埃及的荫下”表示倚靠基于记忆知识的信之事物，而不是信仰任何属灵真理，除非这是记忆知识和感官经验的指示。然而，这是对秩序的一种败坏。信之真理必须占据第一位，进行支持或确认的记忆知识必须占据第二位，因为如果后者占据第一位，人就不会相信任何真理。<br />耶利米书：<br />万军之耶和华以色列的神说，看哪，我必刑罚挪的亚扪和法老，并埃及与埃及的神，以及君王，尤其刑罚法老和倚靠他的人。（耶利米书<a href="http://39-27.cn/耶46.25.htm">46:25</a>）<br />此处“法老”也表示总体上的记忆知识；“倚靠他的人”是指那些倚靠记忆知识，而非圣言，也就是倚靠圣言里的主之人。这样一种倚靠导致信之教义上的一切都完全败坏，这种败坏反过来又导致虚假，以及否认神性和天堂之物是某种事物。这样的人尤其习惯说：“让我亲眼看看这些东西；用事实来向我证明它的真实性，这样我就相信。”然而，即便他们真的看见，即便真的用这种证据来证明，他们也不会相信，因为一种否认的心态掌管一切。<br />同一先知书：<br />攻击法老的话：看哪，有水从北方涨起，成为涨溢的河，要涨过大地和其中所充满的，并城和其中所住的。人必呼喊，地上所有的居民都必哀号。听见敌人壮马蹄跳的响声和战车隆隆，车轮轰轰。（耶利米书<a href="http://39-27.cn/耶47.1.htm">47:1</a>，<a href="http://39-27.cn/耶47.2.htm">2</a>，<a href="http://39-27.cn/耶47.3.htm">3</a>）<br />从此处关于法老所说的每个细节清楚可知，“法老”是指总体上的记忆知识，在此是指处于败坏秩序中的记忆知识，它毁灭信之真理；“涨溢的河”是指毁灭对真理的理解的记忆知识，因而是指荒废的知识；“要涨过大地和其中所充满的”是指向整个教会这样行；“城和其中所住的”是指教会所拥有的真理和这真理所通向的良善；“马蹄跳的响声”是指直接从感官印象所获得的记忆知识的最低种类；“战车隆隆”是指源于这种知识的虚假教义；“车轮轰轰”是指感官印象和伴随它们的发展它们自己的谬论或错误观念。<br />以西结书：<br />主耶和华如此说：看哪，埃及王法老啊，我与你这卧在自己河中的大鲸鱼为敌。你曾说：这河是我的，是我为自己造的。我必用钩子钩住你的腮颊，又使江河中的鱼贴住你的鳞甲。（以西结书<a href="http://39-27.cn/结29.3.htm">29:3</a>，<a href="http://39-27.cn/结29.4.htm">4</a>）<br />此处“法老”也表示总体上的记忆知识，这一点从关于他所讲的每个细节同样明显看出来。<br /><br />你要为埃及王法老作哀歌。你像海中的大鲸鱼；你冲出江河，用爪搅动诸水，使江河浑浊。我将你扑灭的时候，要把天遮蔽，使众星昏暗，以密云遮掩太阳，月亮也不放光。我必使所有亮光都在你以上变为昏暗，使你的地上黑暗。（以西结书<a href="http://39-27.cn/结32.2.htm">32:2</a>，<a href="http://39-27.cn/结32.3.htm">3</a>，<a href="http://39-27.cn/结32.7.htm">7</a>，<a href="http://39-27.cn/结32.8.htm">8</a>）<br />显然，若没有内义，这段描述的细节，和先知书中的许多细节一样，无人能理解。没有人能明白法老像海中的鲸鱼，冲出江河，用爪搅动诸水；他上面的天被遮蔽，众星昏暗，以密云遮掩太阳，月亮也不放光，使他的地上黑暗是什么意思。但内义说明所有这些细节表示什么，即：如果一个人利用记忆知识进入信之秘密，并且若非记忆知识，甚至感官经验使他看见这秘密，就什么也不信，那么记忆知识就会败坏教会的真理，这就是这段描述的内义，这一点从对每个细节的解读明显看出来。<br />法老凭记忆真理，或说包含在记忆知识中的真理而被称为“埃及王”。因为记忆知识就是属世层中的真理，“王”是指真理（参看<a href="1672.htm">1672</a>，<a href="1728.htm">1728</a>，<a href="2015.htm">2015</a>，<a href="2069.htm">2069</a>，<a href="3009.htm">3009</a>，<a href="3670.htm">3670</a>，<a href="4575.htm">4575</a>，<a href="4581.htm">4581</a>，<a href="4966.htm">4966</a>，<a href="5044.htm">5044</a>节）；人民的王和人民所表相同（<a href="4789.htm">4789</a>节）；因此，“法老”和“埃及”所表相同，只是“法老”表示总体上的。前面已多次说明，“埃及”表示记忆知识。法老之所以被比作“海中的鲸鱼”，是因为“鲸鱼”或“海怪”表示记忆知识的总源头（<a href="42.htm">42</a>节），而“海”表示记忆知识的汇集（<a href="28.htm">28</a>节）。经上之所以还说他“冲出江河”，是因为“江河”表示显示聪明的观念，或聪明的事物，但在此表示显示疯狂的观念，或疯狂的事物，因为它们是从感官印象和记忆知识流出的（参看<a href="5196.htm">5196</a>节）。此后经上之所以说他“用爪搅动诸水，使江河浑浊”，是因为“诸水”表示属灵真理（<a href="680.htm">680</a>，<a href="739.htm">739</a>，<a href="2702.htm">2702</a>，<a href="3058.htm">3058</a>，<a href="3424.htm">3424</a>，<a href="4976.htm">4976</a>，<a href="5668.htm">5668</a>节），“脚”表示属世层的事物（<a href="2162.htm">2162</a>，<a href="3147.htm">3147</a>，<a href="3761.htm">3761</a>，<a href="3986.htm">3986</a>，<a href="4280.htm">4280</a>，<a href="4938.htm">4938</a>-<a href="4952.htm">4952</a>节），因此“用爪搅动诸水”表示通过属世层的记忆知识玷污和败坏信之真理；“使江河浑浊”是指向聪明如此行。<br />最后经上之所以说当他将被扑灭的时候，天要被遮蔽，是因为“天”表示人的内层，因为这些的确是他的天。当记忆知识掌管信之真理，也就是说，属世层掌管属灵层时，这些就被“遮蔽”。在这种情况下，真理与良善的知识或认知就会灭亡，这一点由这句话来表示：“我天上的众星和所有亮光昏暗”；因为“众星”是指这些知识或认知（参看<a href="2495.htm">2495</a>，<a href="2849.htm">2849</a>，<a href="4697.htm">4697</a>节），“亮光”是指良善与真理（<a href="30.htm">30</a>-<a href="38.htm">38</a>节）。“我以密云遮掩太阳”表示那时爱之良善无法再流入；“月亮也不放光”表示信之良善也无法再流入；“太阳”是指爱之良善，“月亮”是指信之良善（参看<a href="1529.htm">1529</a>，<a href="1530.htm">1530</a>，<a href="2120.htm">2120</a>，<a href="2495.htm">2495</a>，<a href="3636.htm">3636</a>，<a href="3643.htm">3643</a>，<a href="4060.htm">4060</a>，<a href="4696.htm">4696</a>节）。因此，“我必使你的地上黑暗”表示唯独虚假占据属世心智：黑暗是指虚假 （参看<a href="1839.htm">1839</a>，<a href="1860.htm">1860</a>，<a href="4418.htm">4418</a>，<a href="4531.htm">4531</a>节）；“法老的地”，或“埃及地”是指属世心智（<a href="5276.htm">5276</a>，<a href="5278.htm">5278</a>，<a href="5280.htm">5280</a>，<a href="5288.htm">5288</a>，<a href="5301.htm">5301</a>节）。由此可见，包含在这段预言的细节里面的含义是什么。“法老”表示总体上的记忆知识，故也表示总体上的属世层（<a href="5799.htm">5799</a>节）。</p>

In the carts which Pharaoh had sent to carry him. That this signifies doctrinals from the memory-knowledges of the church, is evident from the signification of "carts," as being doctrinal things (see 
n. 5945); and from the representation of Pharaoh, as being the memory-knowledge of the church in general; for by "Egypt" is signified the memory-knowledge of the church (n. 1462, 4749, 4964, 4966), and 
therefore by its "king" is signified this memory-knowledge in general, as also elsewhere in the Word; but in most passages, as by "Egypt," so also by "Pharaoh," is signified perverted memory-knowledge. 
That "Pharaoh" is memory-knowledge in general, is evident in Isaiah: </p>
<p>     Fools are the princes of Zoan, the wise ones of the counselors of Pharaoh; counsel has become brutish; how say ye unto Pharaoh, 
I am the son of the wise, the son of the kings of antiquity? (Isa. 19:11); </p>
<p>here "Pharaoh" is the memory-knowledge of the church in general, and therefore he is called the "son of the wise," and 
the "son of the kings of antiquity;" the "wise," and the "kings of antiquity," denote the truths of the Ancient Church. But such knowledge made foolishness is here meant, for it is said, "fools are 
the princes of Zoan; the counsel is become brutish." [2] Again: </p>
<p>     They depart to go down into Egypt, but they have not asked at My mouth; to strengthen themselves in the strength of Pharaoh, and 
to trust in the shadow of Egypt. Therefore shall the strength of Pharaoh become to you for a shame, and the trust in the shadow of Egypt for a reproach (Isa. 30:2, 3); </p>
<p>"to strengthen themselves in the 
strength of Pharaoh, and to trust in the shadow of Egypt" denotes to trust to memory-knowledges in the things of faith, and not to have faith in any spiritual truth, unless memory-knowledge and what 
is sensuous dictate it, which nevertheless is of perverted order; for the truths of faith ought to be in the first place, and confirming memory-knowledges in the second place, because if these are in 
the first place nothing whatever of truth is believed. [3] In Jeremiah: </p>
<p>     Hath said Jehovah Zebaoth the God of Israel, Behold I visit upon Amon in No, and upon Pharaoh, and upon Egypt, and upon 
its gods, and upon its kings; especially upon Pharaoh, and them that trust in him (Jer. 46:25); </p>
<p>here also "Pharaoh" denotes memory-knowledge in general; "they that trust in him" are those who trust 
in memory-knowledges, but not in the Word, that is, in the Lord in the Word. Thus everything is perverted in the doctrinals of faith, and hence comes falsity, and also denial that the Divine and heavenly 
is anything. Such especially are in the habit of saying, "Make me see these things with the eye, or show me scientifically that it is so, and then I will believe." And yet if they were to see, and 
if it were shown, they would not believe, because what is negative reigns universally. [4] In the same: </p>
<p>     Against Pharaoh: Behold waters rise up from the north, which shall become an overflowing 
stream, and shall overflow the land and the fullness thereof, the city and them that dwell therein; so that the men shall cry, and all the inhabitants of the land shall howl, at the voice of the stamping 
of the hoofs of his strong horses, and at the tumult of his chariot, the rumbling of his wheels (Jer. 47:1, 2, 3); </p>
<p>from each of the things here said about Pharaoh, it is clear that "Pharaoh" is 
memory-knowledge in general, here in perverted order, which destroys the truths of faith. An "overflowing stream" is memory-knowledge destroying the understanding of truth, and thus vastating; "they shall 
overflow the land and the fullness thereof" denotes that this is done to the whole church; "the city and them that dwell therein" denotes to the truth of the church and the good thence derived; "the 
stamping of the hoofs of the horses" denotes the lowest memory-knowledges, which are direct from things of sense; "the tumult of the chariot" denotes the derivative false doctrine; "the rumbling of 
the wheels" denotes things of sense and their fallacies, which cause to advance. [5] In Ezekiel: </p>
<p>     Hath said the Lord Jehovih; Behold I am against thee, Pharaoh king of Egypt, the great whale that 
lieth in the midst of his rivers, that saith, The river is mine, and I have made myself. Therefore I will put hooks in thy jaws, and I will cause the fish of thy rivers to stick to thy scales (Ezek. 
29:3, 4);  here also "Pharaoh" denotes memory-knowledge in general, as in like manner is evident from all that is said of him. [6] Again: </p>
<p>     Take up a lamentation upon Pharaoh king of Egypt. Thou 
art as whales in the seas; and thou hast come forth with thy streams, and troubled the waters with thy feet, and fouled their streams. When I shall extinguish thee I will cover the heavens, and make 
the stars thereof black; I will cover the sun with a cloud, and the moon shall not make her light to shine; all the luminaries of light will I make black over thee, and will set darkness upon thy land 
(Ezek. 32:2, 3, 7, 8); </p>
<p>that these things, like many in the prophets, cannot be comprehended by anyone without the internal sense, is evident, as that Pharaoh is as whales in the seas, that he came 
forth from his streams, and troubled the waters with his feet; that over him the heavens should be covered, the stars should be made black, and all the luminaries of light; that the sun should be covered 
with a cloud, the moon not give her light, and darkness be set upon his land. But the internal sense teaches what these things signify, namely, that memory-knowledges pervert the truths of the church 
if a man enters by their means into the secrets of faith and believes nothing unless he sees it from them, nay, unless he sees it from things of sense. That this is the internal sense is evident 
from the explication of each expression. [7] Pharaoh is called "king of Egypt" from memory-truth; for memory-knowledge is truth in the natural (that a "king" denotes truth, see n. 1672, 1728, 2015, 
2069, 3009, 3670, 4575, 4581, 4966, 5044), and that the king of a people has the like signification as the people (n. 4789); thus "Pharaoh" has the like signification as "Egypt," but in general. That 
"Egypt" is memory-knowledge has been frequently shown. Pharaoh is compared to "whales in the seas," because a "whale" or "sea-monster" signifies the generals of memory-knowledges (n. 42), and "seas" signify 
collections of memory-knowledges (n. 28). It is also said that he "came forth with his streams," because by "streams" are signified the things of intelligence (see n. 108, 109, 2702, 3051), here 
of insanity, because derived from things of sense and memory-knowledges (see n. 5196). It is then said that he "troubled the waters with his feet, and fouled their streams," because by "waters" are 
signified spiritual truths (n. 680, 739, 2702, 3058, 3424, 4976, 5668), and by "feet," the things of the natural (n. 2162, 3147, 3761, 3986, 4280, 4938-4952), thus "to trouble the waters with his feet" 
denotes to defile and pervert the truths of faith through the memory-knowledges of the natural; and "to foul their streams" is to do thus to intelligence. [8] It is finally said that "when he shall 
be extinguished the heavens shall be covered," because by the "heavens" are signified the interiors of man, since these are indeed his heavens. These are closed when memory-knowledges have dominion over 
the truths of faith, or the natural over the spiritual. That then the knowledges of truth and of good perish, is signified by the words, "I will make the stars of the heavens black, and all the luminaries 
of light" (that the "stars" are these knowledges see n. 2495, 2849, 4697; and that "luminaries" are goods and truths, n. 30-38). That then neither can the good of love anymore flow in, is signified 
by "I will cover the sun with a cloud;" and that neither can the good of faith flow in, is signified by "the moon shall not make her light to shine" (that the "sun" is the good of love, and the 
"moon" the good of faith, see n. 1529, 1530, 2120, 2495, 3636, 3643, 4060, 4696). And that thus only falsities will have possession of the natural mind, is signified by "I will set darkness upon thy 
land" (that "darkness" is falsities, see n. 1839, 1860, 4418, 4531; and that the "land of Pharaoh" or the "land of Egypt" is the natural mind, n. 5276, 5278, 5280, 5288, 5301). From all this it is now 
evident what is the sense contained in these prophetic words. As by "Pharaoh" is signified memory-knowledge in general, by him is also signified the natural in general (n. 5799). </p>

<p align="center"><b>Elliott(1983-1999) 6015</b></p><p><b>6015.</b>
'In the carts which Pharaoh sent to carry him' means the matters of doctrine obtained from the Church's factual knowledge. This is clear from the meaning of 'the carts' as matters of doctrine, dealt 
with in <a href="5945.htm">5945</a>; and from the representation of 'Pharaoh' as the Church's factual knowledge in general. For 'Egypt' means the Church's factual knowledge, <a href="1462.htm">1462</a>, <a href="4749.htm">4749</a>, <a href="4964.htm">4964</a>, <a href="4966.htm">4966</a>, and therefore the king of 
that land means such knowledge in general, as he does elsewhere in the Word, though in the majority of places perverted factual knowledge is meant by Egypt and so also by Pharaoh. The representation 
of 'Pharaoh' as factual knowledge in general is evident in Isaiah, </p>
<blockquote>
The princes of Zoan are foolish, the wise counsellors of Pharaoh; counsel has become brutish. How do you say to Pharaoh, I am a son 
of the wise, a son of the kings of old? <a href="http://bible.gospelcom.net/cgi-bin/bible?passage=Isa%2019:11&amp;version=ESV&amp;interface=print&amp;showfn=yes&amp;showxref">Isa 19:11</a>. 
</blockquote>
<p>Here 'Pharaoh' stands for the Church's factual knowledge in general, which was why he was called 'a son of the wise' and 'a son of the kings of 
old'. 'The wise' and 'the kings of old' stand for the truths that the Ancient Church possessed. But that factual knowledge made nonsensical is meant, for it says 'The princes of Zoan have become foolish; 
counsel has become brutish'. </p>
<p></p>
<p><b>[2]</b>
 In the same prophet, </p>
<blockquote>
They depart to go down to Egypt but have not asked at My mouth, to strengthen themselves in the strength of Pharaoh, and to trust in the 
shadow of Egypt. Therefore the strength of Pharaoh will become shame for you, and trust in the shadow of Egypt ignominy. <a href="http://bible.gospelcom.net/cgi-bin/bible?passage=Isa%2030:2,%203&amp;version=ESV&amp;interface=print&amp;showfn=yes&amp;showxref">Isa 30:2, 3</a>. 
</blockquote>
<p>'Strengthening themselves in the strength of Egypt, and trusting 
in the shadow of Egypt' stands for relying in matters of faith on factual knowledge and having no belief in any spiritual truth unless it is what factual knowledge and sensory evidence so declare. 
But that is a perversion of order. The truths of faith must occupy first place, and supporting factual knowledge must take second place; for if the latter occupy first place, no belief in any truth 
whatever exists.  </p>
<p></p>
<p><b>[3]</b>
 In Jeremiah, </p>
<blockquote>
Jehovah Zebaoth, the God of Israel, said, Behold, I am making a visitation upon Amen in No, and upon Pharaoh, and upon Egypt, and upon its gods, and upon its kings 
- especially upon Pharaoh and those trusting in him. <a href="http://bible.gospelcom.net/cgi-bin/bible?passage=Jer%2046:25&amp;version=ESV&amp;interface=print&amp;showfn=yes&amp;showxref">Jer 46:25</a>.  
</blockquote>
<p>Here also 'Pharaoh' stands for factual knowledge in general. 'Those trusting in him' stands for people who rely on factual knowledge 
but do not rely on the Word, that is, on the Lord in the Word. Such a reliance leads to a complete perversion in the things people are taught to believe, which in turn leads to falsity and also 
to the refusal to accept that what is Divine and heavenly is anything at all. These people in particular are all too ready to say, Let me see these things with my own eyes; or, Produce the facts to prove 
the truth of it, and then I will believe it. But even if they did see them or such proof was produced they would not believe, because an unaccepting attitude of mind governs everything.  </p>
<p></p>
<p><b>[4]</b>
 In 
the same prophet, </p>
<blockquote>
Against Pharaoh.<A name="fntext1"></a><A href="#fn1"><sup>a</sup></a> Behold, waters rising out of the north which will become a deluging stream, and they will deluge the land and all that fills it, the city and those who dwell in 
it, so that men cry out and every inhabitant of the land wails because of the sound of the beat of the hoofs of the horses his mighty ones and the noise of his chariot, the rumble of its wheels. <a href="http://bible.gospelcom.net/cgi-bin/bible?passage=Jer%2047:1-3&amp;version=ESV&amp;interface=print&amp;showfn=yes&amp;showxref">Jer 47:1-3</a>. 
</blockquote>
<p>It is plain from every detail stated here regarding Pharaoh that 'Pharaoh' is factual knowledge in general, existing in this instance in a perverted state of order, which destroys the truths 
of faith. 'A deluging stream' is factual knowledge destroying an understanding of truth, and so is knowledge that lays waste. 'They will deluge the land and all that fills it' is the entire Church. 
'The city and those who dwell in it' is the truth the Church possesses, and the good this truth leads to. 'The beat of the hoofs of the horses' is the lowest kind of factual knowledge gained directly 
from sensory impressions. 'The noise of his chariot' is false teaching derived from that knowledge. 'The rumble of its wheels' is sensory impressions and the false notions going with them that advance 
themselves. </p>

<blockquote>
The Lord Jehovih said, Behold, I am against you, Pharaoh king of Egypt, the great monster who is lying in the midst of his rivers, who has said, The river is mine

<p>Here also 'Pharaoh' stands for factual knowledge in general, 
which in a similar way is evident from each detail that is stated regarding him.  </p>

 In the same prophet, </p>
<blockquote>
Raise a lamentation over Pharaoh king of Egypt. You are like monsters in the seas, and 
you have come forth with your rivers, and have troubled the waters with your feet; you have stirred up their rivers. When I have blotted you out, I will cover the heavens and darken their stars, I 
will cover the sun with a cloud, and the moon will not give its light. All the bright lights [in the heavens] I will darken over you, and I will put darkness over your land. <a href="http://bible.gospelcom.net/cgi-bin/bible?passage=Ezek%2032:1,%203,%207,%208&amp;version=ESV&amp;interface=print&amp;showfn=yes&amp;showxref">Ezek 32:1, 3, 7, 8</a>.

details of this description, like many more in the Prophets, cannot be understood by anyone, it is evident, without the internal sense. No one can understand what is meant when it says that Pharaoh 
is like monsters in the seas, has come forth with<A name="fntext2"></a><A href="#fn2"><sup>b</sup></a> his rivers, and has troubled the waters with his feet. Nor can anyone know what is meant when it says that the heavens will be covered above him, the 
stars will be darkened, and all the bright lights will be darkened; also that the sun will be covered with a cloud, the moon will not give its light, and darkness will be put over his land. But the 
internal sense shows what all these details mean; it shows that factual knowledge perverts the truths of the Church if a person uses it to enter the mysteries of faith without believing anything unless 
factual knowledge, indeed sensory evidence, causes him to see it. This is the internal sense of this description, as the explanation of each separate detail shows. </p>
<p></p>
<p><b>[7]</b>
 Pharaoh is called 'king of 
Egypt' by virtue of the truth factual knowledge holds within it. For factual knowledge is truth as it exists in the natural, and 'king' is truth, see <a href="1672.htm">1672</a>, <a href="1728.htm">1728</a>, <a href="2015.htm">2015</a>, <a href="2069.htm">2069</a>, <a href="3009.htm">3009</a>, <a href="3670.htm">3670</a>, <a href="4575.htm">4575</a>, <a href="4581.htm">4581</a>, <a href="4966.htm">4966</a>, 
<a href="5044.htm">5044</a>; also, much the same is meant by the king of a people as by the people themselves, <a href="4789.htm">4789</a>, so that much the same is meant by 'Pharaoh' as by 'Egypt', but the same thing in general. ('Egypt' has 
been shown many times to mean factual knowledge.) Pharaoh is compared to 'monsters in the seas' because 'a monster' or 'a sea monster' means general sources of facts, <a href="42.htm">42</a>, While 'seas' means gatherings 
together of them, <a href="28.htm">28</a>. Then it is said that he has come forth with his rivers because ideas displaying intelligence are meant by 'rivers', <a href="108.htm">108</a>, <a href="109.htm">109</a>, <a href="2702.htm">2702</a>, <a href="3051.htm">3051</a>, but here ideas displaying insanity since 
they flow from sensory impressions and factual knowledge, <a href="5196.htm">5196</a>. After this it is said that he troubled the waters with his feet and stirred up their rivers because 'waters' means spiritual truths, 
<a href="680.htm">680</a>, <a href="739.htm">739</a>, <a href="2702.htm">2702</a>, <a href="3058.htm">3058</a>, <a href="3424.htm">3424</a>, <a href="4976.htm">4976</a>, <a href="5668.htm">5668</a>, and 'feet' things belonging to the natural, <a href="2162.htm">2162</a>, <a href="3147.htm">3147</a>, <a href="3761.htm">3761</a>, <a href="3986.htm">3986</a>, <a href="4280.htm">4280</a>, <a href="4938.htm">4938</a>-<a href="4952.htm">4952</a>, so that 'troubling the waters with one's feet' is defiling and perverting the 
truths of faith by means of factual knowledge which the natural possesses. And 'stirring up their rivers' is doing the same to intelligence.  </p>
<p></p>
<p><b>[8]</b>
 Finally it is said that when he is blotted out the 
heavens will be covered, because 'the heavens' means a person's interiors, since these are his heavens. They are 'closed' when factual knowledge holds sway over the truths of faith, that is, when the 
natural holds sway over the spiritual. When this is the situation the cognitions or knowledge of truth and good perish, meant by 'I will darken the stars of the heavens, and all the bright lights'; 
for 'the stars' are those cognitions, see <a href="2495.htm">2495</a>, <a href="2849.htm">2849</a>, <a href="4697.htm">4697</a>, and 'the lights' are forms of good and truth, <a href="30.htm">30</a>-<a href="38.htm">38</a>. The inability of the good of love to flow in any longer at that time is meant by 'I will 
cover the sun with a cloud', and the inability of the good of faith to flow in by 'the moon will not give its light' - 'the sun' being the good of love, and 'the moon the good of faith, see <a href="1519.htm">1519</a>, <a href="1530.htm">1530</a>, 
<a href="2120.htm">2120</a>, <a href="2495.htm">2495</a>, <a href="3636.htm">3636</a>, <a href="3643.htm">3643</a>, <a href="4060.htm">4060</a>, <a href="4696.htm">4696</a>. The occupation therefore of the natural mind by falsities alone is meant by 'I will put darkness over your land' - 'darkness' being falsities, <a href="1839.htm">1839</a>, <a href="1860.htm">1860</a>, <a href="4418.htm">4418</a>, 
<a href="4531.htm">4531</a>, and 'Pharaoh's land' or 'the land of Egypt' being the natural mind, <a href="5276.htm">5276</a>, <a href="5278.htm">5278</a>, <a href="5280.htm">5280</a>, <a href="5288.htm">5288</a>, <a href="5701.htm">5701</a>. From all this one may now see what the meaning is within the details of this prophecy. Since 'Pharaoh' 
means factual knowledge in general he also means the natural in general, <a href="5799.htm">5799</a>.

`In vehiculis quae misit Pharaoh ad ferendum illum':  quod significet doctrinalia quae ex scientificis Ecclesiae, constat ex significatione `vehiculorum' quod sint doctrinalia, de qua n. 5945; et ex 
repraesentatione `Pharaonis' quod sit scientificum Ecclesiae in communi; per `Aegyptum' enim significatur scientificum Ecclesiae,  n. 1462, 4749, 4964, 4966, inde per regem ejus scientificum illud in 
communi; ut quoque alibi {1} in Verbo, {2}sed plerisque in locis sicut per Aegyptum ita quoque per Pharaonem significatur scientificum perversum; {3}quod Pharaoh sit scientificum in communi, patet apud 
Esaiam, 	Stulti sunt principes Zoanis, sapientes consiliariorum  (x)Pharaonis, consilium obbrutuit; quomodo (x)dicitis ad Pharaonem, Filius sapientum ego, filius regum antiquitatis? xix 11;  `Pharaoh' 
hic pro scientifico Ecclesiae in communi, inde dictus `filius sapientum, et filius regum antiquitatis'; `sapientes et reges antiquitatis' pro veris Antiquae Ecclesiae; sed scientificum illud hic 
intelligitur infatuatum, nam dicitur `stulti facti principes Zoanis, consilium obbrutuit':  [2]apud eundem, 	Abeunt ad descendendum Aegyptum, sed os Meum non interrogarunt, ad roborandum se robore Pharaonis, 
et ad       confidendum in umbra Aegypti; ideo fiet vobis robur Pharaonis  in pudorem, et fiducia in umbra Aegypti in ignominiam, xxx 2, 3; </p>
<p>`roborare se robore Pharaonis, et confidere in umbra 
Aegypti' pro  fidere scientificis in rebus fidei, et non alicui vero spirituali fidem habere nisi scientificum et sensuale dictet, quod tamen est perversi ordinis; nam primo loco erunt vera fidei, 
et secundo scientifica confirmantia, {4}quia haec si primo loco sunt, {5} prorsus nihil veri creditur:  [3]apud Jeremiam, 	Dixit Jehovah Zebaoth Deus Israelis, Ecce Ego visitans   super Amonem in No; 
et super Pharaonem, et super Aegyptum, et  super deos ejus, et super reges ejus; imprimis super Pharaonem, et confidentes in eo, xlvi 25; </p>
<p>`Pharaoh' hic quoque pro scientifico in communi; `confidentes 
in eo' pro illis (m)qui fidunt scientificis, non autem Verbo, {6}hoc est, Domino in Verbo, inde est omne perversum in doctrinalibus fidei, et inde falsum, et quoque negativum quod Divinum et caeleste 
sit aliquid; hi imprimis in ore gerunt:  (m)Fac mihi videre {7}illa oculariter, aut Demonstra scientifice quod ita sit, et tunc credam; at usque si viderent, et si demonstraretur, nec crederent, ex 
causa quia negativum universaliter regnat:(n) [4]apud eundem, 	Contra {8}Pharaonem; Ecce aquae ascendentes a septentrione, quae fient in flumen inundans, et inundabunt terram et plenitudinem ejus, urbem 
et habitantes in illa, ut clament homines, et ejulet omnis habitator terrae, prae voce plausus equorum ungularum fortium ejus, et tumultu currus ejus, strepitu rotarum ejus, xlvii 1-3; </p>
<p> ex singulis 
quae de Pharaone hic dicta sunt, liquet quod `Pharaoh' sit scientificum in communi, hic {9}in perverso ordine, qui destruit vera fidei; `flumen inundans' est scientificum destruens intellectum veri, 
ac ita vastans; `inundabunt terram et plenitudinem ejus' est Ecclesiam totam; `urbem et habitantes in illa' est verum Ecclesiae et inde bonum; `plausus ungularum equorum' sunt scientifica infima quae 
immediate ex sensualibus; `tumultus currus' est inde doctrinale falsum; `strepitus rotarum' sunt {10}sensualia et illorum fallaciae quae promovent:  [5]apud Ezechielem, 	Dixit Dominus Jehovih, Ecce 
Ego contra te Pharaoh rex  Aegypti, balaena magna, quae cubans in medio fluviorum suorum,  qui {11}dixit, Meus est fluvius, et ego feci me:  propterea dabo {12}hamos in maxillas tuas, et adhaerere faciam 
piscem fluviorum tuorum squamis, xxix 2-4; </p>
<p>`Pharaoh' hic quoque pro scientifico in communi, quod similiter a singulis quae de illo dicuntur, patet: [6]apud eundem, 	Tolle lamentationem super Pharaonem 
regem Aegypti, . . 	Tu sicut balaenae in maribus, et prodiisti cum fluminibus tuis, et turbasti aquas pedibus tuis, conturbasti flumina illarum. . . . Obtegam, cum exstinxero te, caelos; et 
atrabo stellas eorum, solem nube obtegam, et luna non lucere faciet lumen suum; omnia luminaria lucis atrabo super te, et dabo tenebras super terra tua, xxxii 2, 3, 7, 8;  quod haec, sicut plura apud 
Prophetas, absque sensu interno a nemine possint comprehendi, patet; sicut quod `Pharaoh {13}sicut balaenae {14}in maribus, quod prodierit ex fluminibus suis, et turbaverit aquas pedibus suis, quod super 
illum `obtegentur caeli, atrabuntur stellae, et omnia luminaria lucis, nube obtegetur sol, non lucebit luna, et dabuntur tenebrae super terra ejus'; at sensus internus docet quid significant;  nempe 
quod scientifica pervertant vera Ecclesiae si homo per illa intrat in arcana fidei, et nihil credit nisi {15}videat ex illis, immo nisi ex sensualibus;  quod  hic sensus internus sit, patet ab explicatione 
singulorum: [7](m)Pharaoh dicitur `rex Aegypti' ex vero scientifico, nam scientificum est verum {16}in naturali, quod `rex' sit verum, videatur n. 1672, 1728, 2015, 2069, 3009, 3670, 4575, 4581, 
(x)4966, 5044; et quod simile significetur per `regem populi'  quod per `populum,'  n. 4789,(n) ita per Pharaonem simile quod per Aegyptum, sed in communi; quod `Aegyptus' sit scientificum, pluries 
ostensum est; Pharaoh comparatur `{17}balaenis in maribus', quia `balaena' seu cetus significat communia scientificorum, n. 42; et `maria' scientificorum congregationes, n. 28; {18}tum dicitur quod 
`prodierit cum fluminibus suis'  quia per `flumina'  significantur illa quae sunt intelligentiae, n. 108, 109, 2702, 3051, hic quae  sunt insaniae, {19}quoniam ei sensualibus et scientificis, n. 5196: 
 (t)dein dicitur quod `turbaverit aquas pedibus' et `conturbaverit flumina illarum', quia per `aquas' significantur vera spiritualia, n. 680, (x)739, 2702, 3058, 3424, 4976, 5668; et per pedes {20}illa 
quae naturalis sunt, n. 2162, 3147, 3761, 3986, 4280, 4938-4952, ita `turbare aquas pedibus' est conspurcare et pervertere vera  fidei {21}per scientifica quae sunt naturalis; et `conturbare flumina 
illarum' {22}est sic intelligentiam; [8]demum dicitur quod `cum exstinguetur, obtegerentur caeli', quia per `caelos' significantur interiora hominis, {23}siquidem haec sunt caeli ejus; haec `clauduntur' 
cum scientifica super vera fidei dominantur, seu naturale super spirituale; quod tunc cognitiones veri et boni pereant, significatur per `atrabo stellas caelorum, et omnia luminaria lucis'; quod 
`stellae' sint cognitiones illae, videatur n. 2495, 2849, 4697; quod `luminaria' sint bona et vera, n. 30-38; quod nec tunc bonum amoris amplius influere possit, significatur per `solem nube obtegam'; 
et quod nec bonum fidei, significatur per `luna non lucere faciet lumen suum'; quod `sol' sit bonum amoris, et `luna' bonum fidei, videatur n. 1529, 1530, 2120, 2495, 3636, 3643, 4060, 4696; et quod 
sic modo falsa occupabunt mentem naturalem, significatur per `dabo tenebras super terra tua'; quod `tenebrae' sint falsa, n. 1839, 1860, 4418, 4531, et quod `terra Pharaonis seu terra Aegypti' sit mens 
naturalis, n. 5276, 5278, 5280, 5288, 5301; ex his nunc patet quis sensus inest hi propheticis.  Quia per `Pharaonem' significatur scientificum in communi, etiam per illum significatur naturale in
