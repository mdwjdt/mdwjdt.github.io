<h3 align="center" class="ired">属天的奥秘 第819节</h3>
<h4 align="center"></h4><p><strong>819.</strong>在身体下部层面的左侧，有一个相当大的死水湖，长大过宽。在它前面的堤岸上有可怕的巨蟒出现在那里的人身上，诸如栖息在死水中、呼出致命气息的那类巨蟒。在左岸，离那里更远一点，出现了吃人肉的人，他们互相吞食，用牙齿紧紧咬住对方的肩膀。离左边更远一点出现了大鱼、巨鲸，它们把人吞进去，又吐出来。最远处，即对岸则出现了极其扭曲变形的面孔，它们如此丑陋骇人，以至于无法描述，主要是老妪的面孔，这些老妪仿佛疯了似地四处飞奔。右岸则是那些试图用残忍的工具彼此屠杀之人。这些工具因其心肠的麻木冷淡而各异。湖中央处处都是黑色，仿佛停滞了一般。我常惊讶地发现一些精灵（灵）被带到这个湖里。不过，从那里回来的一些人告诉我说，这些人是那些对邻人心怀根深蒂固的仇恨，并且只要有机会，这种仇恨常常会爆发出来的人。他们从中感受最大的乐趣，没有什么比将邻人告上法庭、使他受到惩罚，并且若没有法律制裁阻止他们，还会将其置于死地更令他们快乐的了。死后，人的仇恨和残忍就会转化为这类事物，由它们产生的幻觉对他们来说似乎完全是真的。</p>

<p><strong>[NCE]819.</strong> There is a large, oblong lake to the left, level with the lower parts of the body. Along the front bank, the residents see grotesque snakes of the types that live in standing water, spreading disease on their breath. On the left bank and farther away are seen cannibals eating one another, sinking their teeth into each other's shoulders. Even farther away on the left appear huge fish, monstrous whales that swallow people down and then spit them out. At the farthest end, on the opposite bank, can be seen the most horribly deformed faces, especially those of old hags, so disfigured that they cannot be described, the owners of the faces running every which way as if insane. On the right-hand bank are people who try to kill each other with instruments of torture, the instruments varying with the different kinds of villainy they have at heart. The middle of the lake is uniformly black, like a stagnant pond.<br />Several times I saw people being led to this lake, which surprised me. But I learned about the situation from several others who were leaving. They said that the ones arriving were people who cherished against their neighbor a deep-seated hatred that erupted at every opportunity, affording them supreme pleasure. Nothing had delighted them more, I heard, than hauling their fellow creatures up before a judge and having them sentenced to punishment and — if the penalties of law did not prevent it — to execution.<br />Into such horrors are people's hatreds and cruelties transformed after life in the body. The fantasies that result seem absolutely real to those people. </p>

There is at the left, in a plane with the lower parts of the body, a kind of stagnant lake, large, and of greater length than breadth. About its bank in front there appear to those who are there monstrous 
serpents, such as inhabit stagnant waters, with pestilent breath. Farther away, on the left bank, appear those who eat human flesh, and devour one another, fastening with their teeth on one another's 
shoulders. Still farther away to the left appear great fishes, enormous whales, which swallow a man and vomit him out again. In the farthest distance, or on the opposite shore, appear very ugly 
faces, too monstrous to be described, chiefly those of old women, who run about as if frenzied. On the right bank are those who are trying to butcher each other with cruel instruments, which vary in accordance 
with the direful feelings of their hearts. In the middle of the lake it is everywhere black, as if stagnant. Sometimes I have been surprised to see spirits brought to this lake, but was informed 
by some who came from it and told me, that they were those who had cherished intestine hatred against the neighbor; and that their hatred burst forth as often as occasion offered, in which they perceived 
their greatest delight; and that nothing had pleased them more than to bring a neighbor to judgment and cause punishment to be inflicted on him, and, if the penalties of the law had not deterred 
them, to put him to death. Into such things (as described above) are the hatreds and cruelties of men turned after the life of the body. The phantasies to which their hatreds and cruelties give rise 
have to them the reality of life. </p>

To the left on a level with the lower parts of the body, there is a sizeable stagnant pond, longer than it is broad. Around its nearest edge, monstrous serpents, like those that frequent stagnant ponds 
and whose breath is noxious, appear to those who are there. On the left bank, further away from there, appear those who eat human flesh, and also one another, gripping one another on the shoulder with 
their teeth. Further away still to the left big fish, enormous monsters, appear which swallow a human being and vomit him up again. Furthest away of all, that is, on the opposite side, appear faces 
very deformed, especially those of old women, so monstrous that they defy description, darting around as though they were mad. On the right bank are those who try to slaughter one another with instruments 
of cruelty. These instruments vary according to the callousness of their hearts. In the middle of the pond there is blackness everywhere, as though stagnated. I have frequently been amazed to see 
spirits brought to this pond, but I was told by some of those coming back from there that these were people who had cherished deep-seated hatred against the neighbour and that such hatred had erupted 
as often as it had been given the chance to do so. And in this they felt their greatest delight. Nothing had pleased them more than taking their neighbour to court, causing him to be punished, and, 
if there had been no legal penalties to deter them, putting him to death. These are the kinds of things that people's hatred and cruelty are converted into after death; and the delusions that arise from 
these seem absolutely real to them. </p>

</p><b>819.</b>
Est stagnum quoddam ad sinistrum in plano cum inferioribus corporis, quod capax est, longitudine majore quam latitudine; circa anteriorem ejus ripam apparent iis qui ibi, monstra serpentum, qualium 
in stagnis, cum pestifero halitu: ad ripam sinistram inde remotius apparent ii qui comedunt carnes humanas, seque invicem dentibus haerentes in aliorum humeris: ad sinistrum longius inde apparent magni 
pisces, balaenae monstrosae, quae deglutiunt hominem et evomunt: remotissime, seu in ripa opposita, apparent facies deformissimae, cumprimis anuum, tam monstrosae ut describi nequeant, discurrentes 
sicut insaniae: ad ripam dextram sunt qui crudelibus instrumentis se mutuo interficere tentant; instrumenta sunt varia secundum diritates cordis: in medio stagni est ubivis nigrum, sicut stagnatum.  Aliquoties 
ad stagnum hoc adductos vidi, et miratus; sed instructus ab aliquibus qui inde venerunt, qui dicebant quod essent illi qui intestina odia contra proximum foverunt, et quod odia, quoties data 
esset occasio, eruperint, in quo jucundissimum suum perceperunt; nec eos magis oblectavisse quam provocare proximum ad judicia, et facere ut irrogarentur ei poenae, et si legis supplicia non inhibuissent, 
interficere.  In talia vertuntur odia et crudelitates hominum post vitam corporis; phantasiae eorum inde ortae iis prorsus sicut vivae sunt. </p>
