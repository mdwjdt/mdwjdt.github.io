<h3 align="center" class="ired">属天的奥秘 第6053节</h3>
<h4 align="center"></h4><p><h4 align="center">关于流注，以及灵魂与身体的相互作用</h4><br />6053.任何人都不可能知道，甚至不能思想灵魂进入身体的流注，或灵魂与身体的相互作用，除非他知道灵魂是什么，对它的性质也有所了解。如果对灵魂是什么一无所知，那么对灵魂的流注和相互作用就无从谈起；因为在对其中一个的性质完全缺乏了解的情况下，如何能思想这两部分的相互交流呢？对灵魂性质的这种一无所知十分盛行，尤其盛行于学术界，这一点从以下事实可以看出来：有人认为它是一种空灵之物，有人认为它是某种火焰般或炽热的东西，有人认为它是一种纯粹的思维实体，有人认为它是一种普遍的生命力，还有人认为它是一种自然活动。进一步证明对灵魂性质所盛行的这种无知的证据是，人们把它指派给身体的不同部位：有的将它置于心脏；有的置于脑及其纤维，有的置于纹状体，有的置于脑室，还有的置于脑部小腺体；有的置于身体的每一个部位，但这些人在如此行时却构想出诸如一切有生命之物所常见的那种生命力。由此明显可知，人们对灵魂一无所知。这就是为什么他们所兜售的有关灵魂的观念全是猜测的原因。由于这个原因，人们对灵魂没有任何概念，许多人不可避免地以为灵魂不过是当身体死亡时就消散的一股生命力。这解释了为何有学问的人比简单人更不相信死后的生命；他们因不相信它，故也无法相信属于那生命的任何东西，也就是构成信和爱的属天和属灵实物。这一点从主在马太福音中的话也能明显看出来：<br />你将这些事向智慧聪明人就藏起来，向婴孩就显出来。（马太福音<a href="http://39-27.cn/太11.25.htm">11:25</a>）<br /><br />他们看也看不见，听也听不见，也不明白。（马太福音<a href="http://39-27.cn/太13.13.htm">13:13</a>）<br />因为简单人根本不像有学问的人那样思想灵魂，而是相信他们死后还会活着。尽管他们没有意识到，但这种简单的信仰里面就隐藏了这样的信仰：他们在那里会像人一样活着，会看见天使，与他们交谈，并充满喜乐。</p>

On influx, and on the interaction of the soul with the body.           Nothing whatever can be known or even thought about influx, and about the interaction of the soul with the body, unless it is known 
what the soul is, and also something of its nature. If nothing is definitely known about the soul, nothing can be said about its influx and interaction. For how can the communication of two parts 
be thought of in the total absence of knowledge about the nature of one of them? That complete ignorance prevails about the nature of the soul, especially in the learned world, is evident from the fact 
that some believe it to be an aerial thing, others something flaming or fiery, others a purely thinking entity, others a general vital force, and others a natural activity. And what is a still further 
proof of the prevailing ignorance about the nature of the soul is that various places in the body are assigned it, some placing it in the heart, some in the brain and its fibers, others in the corpora 
striata, others in the ventricles, and others in a small gland; some in every part, but in so doing they conceive of a vitality such as is common to every living thing. From all this it is evident 
that nothing is known about the soul, and this is the reason why all that has been asserted on the subject is conjectural. And as in this way men could have no idea about the soul, very many have not 
been able to avoid the belief that the soul is a mere vital thing that is dissipated when the body dies. And this is the reason why the learned have less belief in the life after death than the simple; 
and because they do not believe in it, neither can they believe in the things which belong to that life, which are the heavenly and spiritual things of faith and love. This also appears from the Lord's 
words in Matthew: </p>
<p>     Thou hast hid these things from the wise and intelligent, and hast revealed them unto babes (Matt 11:25). And again: </p>
<p>     Seeing they see not, and hearing they hear not, 
neither do they understand (Matt. 13:13). For the simple have no such thoughts about the soul; but believe that they will have after death; in which simple faith, unknown to them, there is hidden the 
belief that they will live there as men, will see angels, will speak with them, and will enjoy happiness. </p>

INFLUX AND THE INTERACTION OF THE SOUL WITH THE BODY </p>
<p>No one can have any knowledge at all or even be able to think about the influx of the soul into the body, or about the interaction of them, unless 
he knows what the soul is and also something about the nature of the soul. If nothing is known about what the soul is, nothing at all can be said about its inflow and interaction; for how can anyone 
think about two parts communicating with each other when there is complete lack of knowledge about the nature of one of them? The lack of knowledge, particularly in the learned world, about the whole 
nature of the soul may be seen from the fact that some people think it is something ethereal, others something flame-like or fiery, others something existing purely on the level of thought, others 
a general life-force, and others some natural force. Still greater lack of knowledge about what the soul may be is demonstrated by the varying places in the body to which people assign it. Some assign 
it to the heart, others to the brain - some to its fibres, others to the corpora striata, others to its ventricles, and others to its tiny glands. Others assign it to every part of the body, but these 
people's conception is of a vitality like that common to everything that has life in it. From this it is evident that people know nothing at all about the soul. This is the reason why the ideas they 
have peddled around regarding the soul are all guesswork. And since for this reason they cannot have any idea of what the soul is, very many cannot do other than suppose that it is no more than vitality 
that is dissipated when the body dies. This now explains why the learned have less belief than the simple in a life after death; and because they have no belief in it they cannot have any belief in 
anything belonging to that life, that is, in the celestial and spiritual realities constituting faith and love. This is also evident from the Lord's words in Matthew, </p>
<blockquote>
You have hidden these things 
from the wise and intelligent and have revealed them to young children. <a href="http://bible.gospelcom.net/cgi-bin/bible?passage=Matt%2011:15&amp;version=ESV&amp;interface=print&amp;showfn=yes&amp;showxref">Matt 11:15</a>. 
</blockquote>
<p>And again, </p>
<blockquote>
Those who see do not see, and those who hear do not hear, nor do they understand. <a href="http://bible.gospelcom.net/cgi-bin/bible?passage=Matt%2013:13&amp;version=ESV&amp;interface=print&amp;showfn=yes&amp;showxref">Matt 13:13</a>. 
</blockquote>
<p>For 
the simple do not think at all about the soul in the way that the learned do but believe that they will be alive after death. Concealed within their simple faith, though they are not conscious of 
it, is the belief that they will live there as people, seeing the angels, talking to them, and being filled with joy. </p>

De influxu et de commercio animae cum corpore prorsus nihil sciri, ne quidem cogitari potest nisi sciatur quid anima, et quoque aliquid de ejus quali; si anima {1}sit ignotum quid, nequaquam aliquid 
de ejus influxu et commercio dici potest; quomodo enim de communicatione duarum partium potest cogitari cum {2}una prorsus ignoratur {2}qualis sit.  Quod anima ignoretur quoad omne suum quale, in mundo 
imprimis erudito, constare potest ex eo quod quidam credant illam esse aethereum quid, quidam flammeum aut igneum quid, quidam {3}pure cogitativum, quidam vitale ex communi, quidam activum naturale; 
et quod adhuc magis ignorantiam {4}, quid anima, testatur, est quod loca ei (t)varia in corpore assignent, nempe quidam in corde, quidam in cerebro et ibi in fibris, alii in corporibus striatis, alii 
in ventriculis {5}, et alii in exigua glandula, quidam {6} in omni parte, {7}at tunc concipiunt vitale, quale est commune omni vivo; ex quibus patet quod de anima {8}nihil notum habeatur; haec causa 
est quod conjecturalia sint quae de anima venditata fuerunt.  Et quia sic nullam de illa ideam habere potuerunt, perplures non potuerunt aliter credere quam quod non sit aliud quam vitale {9}, quod cum 
moritur corpus, dissipatur; inde nunc est quod eruditi minus quam simplices credant vitam post mortem, et quia illam non credunt, nec credere possunt quae illius vitae sunt, quae sunt caelestia et 
spiritualia (t)fidei et amoris; hoc quoque patet a Domini verbis, apud Matthaeum, 	Abscondisti (x)haec sapientibus et intelligentibus, et revelasti infantibus, xi 25: </p>
<p>et rursus, 	Videntes non vident, 
et audientes non audiunt, nec intelligunt, xiii 13; simplices enim nihil tale cogitant de anima sed credunt quod victuri post mortem, in qua simplici fide, illis nescientibus, latet quod victuri ibi 
sicut homines, visuri angelos, locuturi cum illis, et fruituri gaudio. @1 ignotissimum quid sit$ @2 unum . . . quale$ @3 purum$ @4 i inter eruditos$ @5 i ibi$ @6 i quod sit$ @7 et$ @8 i prorsus$ @9
