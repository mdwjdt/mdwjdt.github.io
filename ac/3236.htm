That Abraham here represents the Lord as to Divine good spiritual, and his woman as to Divine truth adjoined to this good, is evident from what has been said before concerning husbands and wives, namely, 
that the husband represents good and the wife truth (as Abraham and Sarah heretofore, n. 1468, 1901, 2063, 2065, 2172, 2173, 2198, 2904; and as Isaac and Rebekah in the preceding chapter, n. 3077). 
The reason why the husband represents good, and the wife truth, is that the church is compared to a marriage, and also is the marriage of good and truth. Good is what the husband represents, because 
it is in the first place; but truth is what the wife represents, because it is in the second place; therefore also in the Word the Lord is called a "bridegroom," a "man" [vir], a "husband"; and the 
church is called a "bride," a "woman," a "wife."  [2] What spiritual good is, and what the spiritual truth adjoined to this good, may be seen from the passages cited immediately above (n. 3235). Spiritual 
good in man is in general what is called the good of faith, and this is no other than charity toward the neighbor; but in order that it may be charity, it must come from the new will with which 
the spiritual man is gifted by the Lord. The spiritual truth adjoined to this good is what is called the truth of faith, and this is no other than that which regards charity first as the end for the sake 
of which it exists; and afterwards as the beginning from which it proceeds; but in order that it may be the truth of faith to the spiritual man, or faith, it must come from the new understanding with 
which he is gifted by the Lord; and the new understanding must have its light from the new will. </p>

'Abraham' here represents the Lord as regards Divine Spiritual Good, and his wife as regards Divine Truth allied to that Good. This becomes clear from what has been stated already about husbands and 
wives (maritus and uxor) - that 'the husband' represents good, and 'the wife' truth, as Abraham and Sarah did previously, <a href="1468.htm">1468</a>, <a href="1901.htm">1901</a>, <a href="2063.htm">2063</a>, <a href="2065.htm">2065</a>, <a href="2172.htm">2172</a>, <a href="2173.htm">2173</a>, <a href="2198.htm">2198</a>, <a href="2904.htm">2904</a>, and as Isaac and Rebekah did in 
the chapter before this, <a href="3077.htm">3077</a>. The reason why 'the husband' represents good and 'the wife' truth is that the Church is compared to a marriage, and also is a marriage of good and truth. Good is what 
the husband represents because this is primary, while truth is what the wife represents because that is secondary. This also is why in the Word the Lord is called bridegroom, man, and husband, while the 
Church is called bride, woman, and wife. </p>

 What spiritual good is and spiritual truth allied to that good becomes clear from the places referred to immediately above in <a href="3235.htm">3235</a>. With the spiritual 
man good is in general that which is called the good of faith, which is nothing else than charity towards the neighbour. But to be charity it must come from the new will which the Lord confers on the 
spiritual man. Spiritual truth allied to that good is what is called the truth of faith, which initially does nothing else than see charity as the end in view for which it exists, and later on as the 
source of its own existence. To be the truth of faith, or to be faith, it must in the case of the spiritual man come from a new understanding which the Lord confers on him, and which must receive its 
light from the new will. </p>

Quod Abraham hic repraesentet Dominum quoad Divinum Bonum spirituale et quod ejus mulier quoad Divinum Verum illi Bono adjunctum, constare potest ex illis quae prius de maritis et uxoribus dicta sunt, 
nempe quod `maritus' repraesentet bonum, et `uxor' verum, sicut prius Abraham et Sarah, n. 1468, 1901, 2063, 2065, 2172, 2173, 2198, 2904; et sicut in capite praecedente Jishak et Rebecca, n. 3077: 
quod `maritus' repraesentet bonum, et `uxor' verum, causa est quia Ecclesia comparatur conjugio, et quoque est conjugium boni et veri; bonum est quod maritus repraesentat, quia primo loco est, verum 
autem quod uxor quia secundo; ideo quoque Dominus in Verbo vocatur `sponsus, vir, maritus,' et Ecclesia `sponsa, mulier, uxor.' [2] (m)Quid spirituale bonum (c)et spirituale veram illi bono adjunctum 
{1}, constare potest ab illis locis quae mox supra n. 3235 citata sunt; apud hominem spirituale bonum est in genere id quod vocatur bonum fidei, et hoc non aliud quam charitas erga proximum, sed ut {2}sit 
charitas, veniet ex nova voluntate qua spiritualis homo donatus est a Domino; spirituale verum illi bono adjunctum est id quod dicitur verum fidei, et hoc non aliud quam quod spectat charitatem primo 
ut finem propter quem et dein ut principium ex quo; sed ut sit spirituali homini verum fidei, seu fides, veniet ex novo intellectu quo donatus est a Domino, et novus intellectus {3}lucem suam habebit 
a nova voluntate.(n) @1 i sit$  @2 fit I$  @3 i est, qui$  </p>
