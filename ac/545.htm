<h4 align="center"></h4><p><strong>545.</strong>为让我了解天堂和天堂之乐的性质和品质，主常许我长时间地感受种种天堂之乐，以使我有确切的体验，因为那是活生生的经历，但我无法给予描述，只能略作说明，以提供一些概念。这是一种伴随着无数快乐的情感，这无数的快乐又组成一个总的、同步的快乐。无数情感和谐地组成一个总的快乐或总的情感，人对此的感受并不清晰，十分模糊，因为人的直觉非常一般。但我还是被允许觉察到，其中有无量的元素十分美妙地排列组合，美到无法描述。这无量的元素照天堂的样式流动，每个细微的情感都有这种样式蕴含其中。这些情感被感受为一个总体，与体验者的觉受能力相一致。总而言之，每个总体情感都由无量的元素按完美的样式组合而成，它们都具有活力，影响至深，因为天堂之乐正是发自至内在。我还觉察到，天堂之乐似乎从心发出，经内部神经隐约地传播，然后进入神经束，赋予我至深的快乐感受，乃至每一条神经似乎就是快乐本身。我所感受的一切都具有活力，充满极乐。相比之下，肉体的快乐好比浓重到令人窒息的灰尘，而天堂的快乐则好比纯净而柔和的清风。</p>

<p><strong>[NCE]545.</strong> In order to teach me about the existence and nature of heaven and heavenly joy, the Lord has given me the opportunity to perceive the pleasures of heavenly joy frequently and for extended periods. Because I have learned these things by actually experiencing them, I possess the knowledge but cannot possibly put it into words.<br />To offer just an idea of it: The countless pleasures and joys there, which come together to create a single experience shared by all, carry with them a certain emotion. Within that common experience, or that common emotion, are points of harmony among a boundless number of feelings. These individual points of harmony do not come clearly but only vaguely to our awareness, because our perception is extremely generalized. Even so, I was allowed to perceive that there were countless parts, organized in a way that can never be described. Those countless parts flow from the order that exists in heaven, which determines their nature.<br />[2] The smallest individual elements of an emotion are organized in such a way that they are presented and sensed only as a collective whole, according to the capacities of the person who feels the emotion. In a word, every whole has an unlimited number of parts, organized in the most perfect way; every one of the parts is alive; and every one of them affects us, all the way to our inmost recesses. For the inmost recesses are where heavenly joy comes from.<br />I also perceived that joy and pleasure seemed to come from my heart, gently permeating all the inmost fibers of my body and thus all the bundles of fibers.{*1} The sensation of this joy at the deepest levels made it seem as though each fiber was composed of nothing but joy and pleasure and all the perceptiveness and sensitivity that come with joy and pleasure. The fibers seemed alive with happiness.<br />The joy we feel in physical indulgence, compared to these joys, is like a coarse, stinging dust compared to the gentlest breath of pure air.<br /><br /><strong>Footnotes:</strong><br />{*1} Swedenborg's use of the term fiber here is specific for individual nerve fibers. Like other scientists of his day, he was aware of the bundling of these into fascicles, and of fascicles into nerves, and he reserves the use of the term "nerve" to these tertiary bundles of fibers, as would a scientist today. See Dynamics of the Soul's Domain (Swedenborg [1740-1741] 1955), part 1, <a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_545/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_157" target=_top>157</a>: "A fiber is a unit of the first order, a fascicle of fibers a unit of the second order, and a nerve a unit of the third order." For Swedenborg's descriptive anatomy and derivation of this system, see his posthumously published manuscript Draft on the Fiber (Swedenborg 1976a) 1-327. [RPB] </p>

But in order that I might know the nature and quality of heaven and of heavenly joy, for long and often I have been permitted by the Lord to perceive the delights of heavenly joys, so that as I know 
them from actual experience I can indeed know them, but can by no means describe them. However, in order to give some idea of it I may say that heavenly joy is an affection of innumerable delights and 
joys that form one general simultaneous joy, in which general joy, that is, in which general affection, there are harmonies of innumerable affections that do not come distinctly to perception, but obscurely, 
because the perception is very general. Yet I was permitted to perceive that there are things innumerable within it, in such order as can never be described, these innumerable things being such 
as flow from the order of heaven. Such order exists in every least thing of the affection, all of which together are presented and perceived as a very general one according to the capacity of him who 
is the subject of it. In a word, in every general joy or affection there are illimitable things ordinated in a most perfect form, and there is nothing that is not alive or that does not affect even 
the inmost things of our being, for heavenly joys proceed from inmost things. I perceived also that the joy and deliciousness came as if from the heart, and very softly diffused themselves through all 
the inmost fibers, and so into the congregated fibers, with such an inmost sense of delight that the fiber is as it were nothing but joy and deliciousness, and the whole derivative perceptive and sensitive 
sphere the same, being alive with happiness. In comparison with these joys the joy of bodily pleasures is like gross and pungent dust as compared with a pure and gentle breeze. </p>

<p align="center"><b>Elliott(1983-1999) 545</b></p><p><b>545.</b>
To enable me to know what heaven and heavenly joy are, and the nature of them, the Lord has allowed me frequently and for long periods to perceive the delights that accompany heavenly joys. From my actual 
experience therefore I can know them but in no sense describe them. However, so that people may have a rough idea of it, let me say this: It is the affection accompanying countless joys and delights 
which product one general and simultaneous joy. That general joy, or general affection, consists of harmonious bands of countless affections, none of which focus clearly in one's perception, but 
only indistinctly, because one's perception is very general. Nevertheless I have been allowed to perceive that it contains countless things whose ordering defies description. Those countless things are 
such as flow from the order of heaven itself. </p>
<p></p>
<p><b>[2]</b>
 This order extends to the smallest individual areas of the affection, which present themselves and are perceived simply as one very general whole. 
They present themselves and are perceived according to the capacity of the person subject to them. In a word, every general affection contains innumerable parts ordered into a perfect form. No part 
is devoid of life or fails to affect. This applies to the inmost parts in particular, for heavenly joys stem from things that are inmost. I have also perceived that the joy and delight went out as it 
were from the heart and very gently spread themselves through every inmost fibre, and from there into every cluster of fibres, doing so with such an interior sense of delight that a fibre was so to speak 
nothing but joy and delight; and all resulting perceptivity and feeling in like manner was alive with happiness. In comparison with those joys, the joy that accompanies the desires of the flesh is 
as thick choking smog to a pure and very gentle breeze.  </p>

</p><b>545.</b>
Sed ut scire possem quid et quale caelum et caeleste gaudium, saepe et diu, a Domino datum est percipere jucunditates gaudiorum caelestium; quare quia ab experientia viva, possum scire sed nusquam describere: 
ast ut solum idea ejus habeatur; est affectio jucunditatum et gaudiorum innumerabilium, quae commune quoddam simultaneum sistunt, in quo communi, seu in qua communi affectione, sunt innumerabilium 
affectionum harmoniae, quae distincte non perveniunt ad perceptionem sed obscure, quia communissima perceptio; usque percipere datum quod innumerabilia inessent, ita ordinata ut describi nusquam 
possint; innumerabilia illa, qualia ex caeli ordine fluunt.  [2] Talis ordo est in affectionis singulis et minimis, quae modo ut communissimum unum sistuntur et percipiuntur secundum capacitatem ejus 
qui est objectum; verbo, indefinita in ordinatissima forma insunt cuicumque communi, et nihil non vivit et afficit, et quidem intima, nam gaudia caelestia ab intimis procedunt.  Perceptum quoque, quod 
gaudium et delicium sicut a corde veniret, se diffundens mollissime per omnes fibras intimas, et inde in fibras congregatas, cum tali jucunditatis intimo sensu ut fibra sit quasi nihil nisi gaudium 
et delicium, et omne perceptivum et sensitivum inde similiter vivens ex felicitate: voluptatum corporis gaudium ad illa gaudia est sicut crassus et pungens grumus respective ad puram et lenissimam auram. </p>
