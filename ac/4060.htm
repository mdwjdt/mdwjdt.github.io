<h3 align="center" class="ired">属天的奥秘 第4060节</h3>
<h4 align="center"></h4><p><strong>4060.</strong>因此，前面（<a href="4056.htm">4056</a>节）所引用的那些话表示那时教会在良善，就是在对邻之仁和对主之爱方面的状态。这一点从它们的内义明显可知，内义如下：<br />“那些日子的灾难一过去”表示教会在信之真理方面的状态，如刚才所述。在圣言中，真理的荒废在各处都被称作“灾难”，“日子”是指状态（参看<a href="23.htm">23</a>，<a href="487.htm">487</a>，<a href="488.htm">488</a>，<a href="493.htm">493</a>，<a href="893.htm">893</a>，<a href="2788.htm">2788</a>，<a href="3462.htm">3462</a>，<a href="3785.htm">3785</a>节）。由此明显可知，这些话表示，一旦信不复存在，仁也就不存在了。事实上，信通向仁，因为信教导何为仁，仁从信之真理接受其品质。然而，信之真理从仁接受其本质和生命，这一点在前几卷已反复说明。<br />“日头就变黑了，月亮也不放光”表示对主之爱，就是“日头”；对邻之仁，就是“月亮”。“就变黑了”和“也不放光”表示那爱与仁不会出现，因而会消失。“日头”表示爱的属天种类，“月亮”表示爱的属灵种类；也就是说，“日头”表示对主之爱，“月亮”表示通过信而来的对邻之仁（参看<a href="1053.htm">1053</a>，<a href="1529.htm">1529</a>，<a href="1530.htm">1530</a>，<a href="2120.htm">2120</a>，<a href="2441.htm">2441</a>，<a href="2495.htm">2495</a>节）。太阳和月亮之所以具有这样的含义，是因为在来世，主向那些处于对主之爱、被称为属天的人显为一轮太阳，向那些处于对邻之仁、被称为属灵的人显为一轮月亮（参看<a href="1053.htm">1053</a>，<a href="1521.htm">1521</a>，<a href="1529.htm">1529</a>-<a href="1531.htm">1531</a>，<a href="3636.htm">3636</a>，<a href="3643.htm">3643</a>节）。<br />天上的太阳和月亮，也就是主从不变黑，也不会失去它们的光，而是永远发光；因而在天上，属天天使所具有的对主之爱不会变黑，属灵天使所具有的对邻之仁也不会失去它的光；地上与这些天使同在的人，也就是那些处于爱与仁的人也不会。然而，那些没有爱与仁，而是陷入自我之爱和尘世之爱，因而陷入仇恨和报复的人就给自己招来这种“变黑”。这就像是这个世界的太阳不断发光，但当有乌云介入时，这太阳就看不见了（<a href="2441.htm">2441</a>节）。<br />“众星要从天上坠落”表示对良善与真理的认知要灭亡。在圣言中，当提及“众星”时，它们没有其它含义（<a href="1808.htm">1808</a>，<a href="2849.htm">2849</a>节）。“天势都要震动”表示教会的根基，当这些认知灭亡时，就说这些根基“震动”或“摇撼”。这是因为地上的教会就是天堂的根基；良善与真理从主经由天堂的流注最后终结于教会成员所具有的良善与真理。所以，当教会成员的状态如此败坏，以致他不再允许良善或真理流入他里面时，就说天势要“震动”。正因如此，主一直规定，教会的某种遗迹要存留下来；并且当旧教会灭亡时，一个新教会要再次兴起。<br />“那时，人子的兆头要显在天上”表示那时神性真理的显现；“兆头”表示显现；“人子”表示神性真理方面的主（参看<a href="2803.htm">2803</a>，<a href="2813.htm">2813</a>，<a href="3704.htm">3704</a>节）。门徒们所问的，就是这种显现或“兆头”，当时他们对主说：<br />请告诉我们，什么时候有这些事？你降临和这世代的终结，有什么预兆呢？（马太福音<a href="http://39-27.cn/太24.3.htm">24:3</a>）<br />因为他们从圣言知道，当世代要终结时，主就会到来；他们从主自己得知，祂会“再来”，他们将主的“再来”理解为主第二次降世；殊不知每当教会被毁时，主都会到来，但不是以人的形式到来，如祂通过生在世上披上人身并使这人身变成神性时的情形，而是通过祂自己的显现或显明到来，如当祂在幔利向亚伯拉罕显现，在荆棘中向摩西显现，在西乃山向以色列人显现，在约书亚进入迦南地的时候向他显现时的情形；或不是如此显现，而是通过领受启示并由此给出圣言，后来则通过圣言本身显现时的情形。因为主就存在于圣言中；圣言中的一切细节都出自祂，并论及祂，这一点从直到目前的多次说明可以看出来。这后者就是此处“人子的兆头”所表示的显现，也就是本节所论述的主题。<br />“地上的众支派都要哀哭”表示所有处于爱之良善和信之真理的人都要悲伤。这就是“哀哭”的意思（参看撒迦利亚书<a href="http://39-27.cn/亚12.10.htm">12:10</a>-<a href="http://39-27.cn/亚12.14.htm">14</a>）；“支派”表示良善与真理的一切事物，就是爱与信的一切事物，因而表示那些处于这些事物的人（参看<a href="3858.htm">3858</a>，<a href="3926.htm">3926</a>节）。经上之所以用“地上的支派”这个词，是因为所指的是那些在教会之内的人，“地”是指教会（参看<a href="662.htm">662</a>，<a href="1066.htm">1066</a>，<a href="1067.htm">1067</a>，<a href="1262.htm">1262</a>，<a href="1733.htm">1733</a>，<a href="1850.htm">1850</a>，<a href="2117.htm">2117</a>，<a href="2928.htm">2928</a>，<a href="3355.htm">3355</a>节）。<br />“他们要看见人子有能力，有大荣耀，驾着天上的云降临”表示那时圣言的内义将被揭示出来，主就存在于内义中。“人子”表示圣言里面的神性真理（<a href="2803.htm">2803</a>，<a href="2813.htm">2813</a>，<a href="3704.htm">3704</a>节）；“云”表示字义；“能力”论及良善，“荣耀”论及其中的真理。“看见人子驾着天上的云降临”表示这些事（参看18章的序言）。这就是此处所指的主的到来，不是字面上所说的祂要显现在云中。接下来的主题是一个新教会的建立，一旦旧教会被毁坏和抛弃，这种事就会发生。<br />“祂要差遣祂的使者，用号筒的大声”表示拣选，不是通过可见的天使，更不是通过号筒的大声拣选，而是通过从主经由天使而来的神圣良善与神圣真理的流注拣选；因此，在圣言中，“使者或天使”表示本质上属于主的某种事物（<a href="1925.htm">1925</a>，<a href="2821.htm">2821</a>，<a href="3039.htm">3039</a>节）；在此表示出于主并涉及主的事物。“号筒”和“大声”表示福音传播，和在圣言别处的一样。<br />“将祂的选民从四风，从天这边到天那边，都招聚了来”表示一个新教会的建立。“选民”是指那些处于爱与信之良善（<a href="3755.htm">3755</a>-<a href="3900.htm">3900</a>节）；他们要被招聚所来的“四风”是指良善与真理的一切状态（<a href="3708.htm">3708</a>节）；“从天这边到天那边”表示教会的内在和外在。这些就是主的这些话所表示的事。</p>

<p align="center"><b>Potts(1905-1910) 4060</b></p><p><b>4060.</b>
Therefore that by the words now before us there is signified the state of the church at that time in respect to good (that is, as to charity toward the neighbor and love to the Lord), is evident from 
their internal sense, which is as follows: </p>
<p>But immediately after the affliction of those days; </p>
<p>signifies the state of the church in respect to the truth of faith (concerning which just above). In the 
Word the desolation of truth in various places is called "affliction." (That "days" are states may be seen above, n. 23, 487, 488, 493, 893, 2788, 3462, 3785.) From this it is manifest that by these 
words is signified that after there is no longer any faith, there will be no charity. For faith leads to charity, because it teaches what charity is, and charity receives its quality from the truths 
of faith; but the truths of faith receive their essence and their life from charity, as has been repeatedly shown in the preceding volumes. [2] The sun shall be darkened, and the moon shall not give 
her light; signifies love to the Lord, which is the "sun;" and charity toward the neighbor, which is the "moon." "To be darkened and not to give their light" signifies that they will not appear, and 
thus will vanish away. (That the "sun" is the celestial of love, and the "moon" the spiritual of love; that is, that the "sun" is love to the Lord, and the "moon" charity toward the neighbor, which comes 
forth through faith, may be seen above, n. 1053, 1529, 1530, 2120, 2441, 2495.) The reason why this is the signification of the "sun and moon," is that in the other life the Lord appears as a sun 
to those in heaven who are in love to Him, and who are called the celestial; and as a moon to those who are in charity toward the neighbor, and who are called the spiritual (see n. 1053, 1521, 1529-1531, 
3636, 3643). [3] The sun and moon in the heavens (that is, the Lord) is never darkened, nor does it lose its light, but it shines perpetually; and so neither is love to the Lord darkened with the 
celestial, nor does charity toward the neighbor lose its light with the spiritual, in the heavens; nor on earth with those with whom these angels are, that is, those who are in love and charity. Those 
however who are in no love and charity, but in the love of self and of the world, and consequently in hatred and revenge, bring that "darkening" upon themselves. The case herein is as it is with the 
sun of this world, which shines continuously; but when the clouds interpose, it does not appear (n. 2441). [4] And the stars shall fall from heaven; </p>
<p>signifies that the knowledges of good and truth 
will perish. Nothing else is signified by "stars" when these are mentioned in the Word (n. 1808, 2849).      And the powers of the heavens shall be shaken; signifies the foundations of the church, which 
are said to be "shaken" and "made to quake" when they perish. For the church on earth is the foundation of heaven, because the influx of good and truth from the Lord through the heavens finally terminates 
in the goods and truths that are with the man of the church. When therefore the man of the church is in such a perverted state as no longer to admit the influx of good and truth, the powers of 
the heavens are said to be "shaken." For this reason it is always provided by the Lord that something of the church shall remain; and that when an old church perishes, a new one shall be set up again. [5] 
And then shall appear the sign of the Son of man in heaven; </p>
<p>signifies the appearing of Divine truth at that time; the "sign" signifies the appearing; the "Son of man," the Lord as to Divine truth 
(see n. 2803, 2813, 3704). It was this appearing or this "sign," concerning which the disciples asked when they said, "Tell us when shall these things be, and what shall be the sign of Thy coming, 
and of the consummation of the age" (verse 3). For they knew from the Word that when the age should be consummated, the Lord would come; and they learned from the Lord Himself that He would "come again," 
by which they understood that the Lord would once more come into the world; not yet knowing that the Lord has come whenever the church has been vastated, not indeed in person, as when He assumed 
the human by birth and made it Divine; but by means of appearings-either manifest, as when He appeared to Abraham in Mamre, to Moses in the bush, to the people of Israel on Mount Sinai, and to Joshua 
when he entered the land of Canaan; or not so manifest, as by inspirations through which the Word was given, and afterwards through the Word; for the Lord is present in the Word, because all things in 
the Word are from Him and concerning Him, as may be seen from what has already been frequently shown. This latter is the appearing here signified by the "sign of the Son of man," and which is described 
in this verse. [6] And then shall all the tribes of the earth wail; </p>
<p>signifies that all who are in the good of love and the truth of faith shall be in grief. That "wailing" signifies this, may be 
seen in Zechariah 12:10-14; and that "tribes" signify all things of good and truth, or of love and faith, and consequently those who are in them, may be seen above (n. 3858, 3926). They are called the 
"tribes of the earth," because those are meant who are within the church. (That the "earth" is the church may be seen above, n. 662, 1066, 1067, 1262, 1733, 1850, 2117, 2928, 3355.) [7] And they shall 
see the Son of man coming in the clouds of the heavens with power and great glory; </p>
<p>signifies that the Word will then be revealed as to its internal sense, in which the Lord is; the "Son of man" is 
the Divine truth therein (n. 2803, 2813, 3704); the "cloud" is the literal sense; "power" is predicated of the good, and "glory" of the truth, therein. (That these things are signified by "seeing the 
Son of man coming in the clouds of the heavens," see the preface to the eighteenth chapter.) This is the "coming of the Lord" here meant, and not that He will literally appear in the clouds. Now follows 
the subject of the setting up of a New Church, which takes place when the old one is vastated and rejected. [8] He shall send forth His angels with a trumpet and a great voice; </p>
<p>     signifies election, 
not by visible angels, still less by trumpets, and by great voices; but by the influx of holy good and holy truth from the Lord through angels; and therefore by "angels" in the Word there is 
signified something of the Lord (n. 1925, 2821, 3039); here, there are signified things that are from the Lord and concerning the Lord. By the "trumpet" and the "great voice" there is signified evangelization, 
as elsewhere in the Word. [9] And they shall gather together His elect from the four winds, from the end of the heavens even to the end thereof; </p>
<p>signifies the setting up of a New Church. The 
"elect" are those who are in the good of love and of faith (n. 3755-3900); the "four winds" from which they shall be gathered together, are all states of good and truth (n. 3708); "from the end of 
the heavens to the end of them" denotes the internals and the externals of the church. Such therefore are the things signified by these words of the Lord.            GENESIS 31 </p>
<p>     1. And he heard 
the words of Laban's sons, saying, Jacob hath taken all that was our father's; and from that which was our father's hath he made all this abundance.      2. And Jacob saw the faces of Laban, and behold 
he was not at all with him as yesterday and the day before.      3. And Jehovah said unto Jacob, Return unto the land of thy fathers, and to thy nativity, and I will be with thee.      4. And 
Jacob sent, and called Rachel and Leah to the field unto his flock.      5. And he said unto them, I see your father's faces, that he is not at all toward me as yesterday and the day before; and the 
God of my father hath been with me.      6. And ye know that with all my strength I have served your father.      7. And your father hath deceived me, and hath changed my reward ten ways, and God hath 
not suffered him to do evil with me.      8. If he said thus, The speckled shall be thy reward, then all the flock bare speckled; and if he said thus, The party-colored shall be thy reward, then all 
the flock bare party-colored.      9. And God hath taken away the acquisition of your father, and hath given it to me.      10. And it came to pass at the time that the flock grew warm, that I lifted 
up mine eyes, and saw in a dream, and behold the he-goats which leaped upon the flock were party-colored, speckled, and grizzled.      11. And the angel of God said unto me in the dream, Jacob; 
and I said, Behold me!      12. And he said, Lift up I pray thine eyes, and see all the he-goats which leap upon the flock, party-colored, speckled, and grizzled; for I have seen all that Laban doeth 
unto thee.      13. I am the God of Bethel, where thou anointedst a pillar, where thou vowedst a vow unto me; now arise, go forth out of this land, and return unto the land of thy nativity.      14. 
And Rachel and Leah answered and said unto him, Have we any longer a portion and inheritance in our father's house?      15. Are we not counted of him strangers? For he hath sold us, and devouring 
hath also devoured our silver.      16. For all the riches which God hath taken away from our father, they are ours and our sons'; and now all that God hath said unto thee, do.      17. And Jacob arose, 
and lifted his sons and his women upon the camels.      18. And he carried away all his acquisition, and all his substance which he had gathered, the acquisition of his purchase, which he had gathered 
in Paddan-aram, to go to Isaac his father in the land of Canaan.      19. And Laban was gone to shear his flock; and Rachel stole the teraphim which were her father's.      20. And Jacob stole 
the heart of Laban the Aramean, in that he told him not that he was fleeing.      21. And he fled, he and all that he had; and he arose and passed over the river, and set his face toward the mountain 
of Gilead.      22. And it was told Laban on the third day, that Jacob was fled.      23. And he took his brethren with him, and pursued after him a way of seven days, and joined him in the mountain 
of Gilead.      24. And God came to Laban the Aramean in a dream by night, and said unto him, Take heed to thyself lest thou speak with Jacob from good even to evil.      25. And Laban came up with 
Jacob, and Jacob pitched his tent in the mountain; and Laban pitched with his brethren in the mountain of Gilead.      26. And Laban said to Jacob, What hast thou done, that thou hast stolen my heart, 
and hast carried away my daughters as captives of the sword?      27. Wherefore hast thou concealed thyself to flee? and hast stolen me? and hast not told me? And I would have sent thee away with 
gladness, and with songs, with timbrel, and with harp.      28. And thou hast not suffered me to kiss my sons and my daughters; now thou hast acted foolishly.      29. Let my hand be to God to do 
you evil! And the God of your father spake unto me yesternight, saying, Take heed to thyself that thou speak not with Jacob from good even to evil.      30. And now going thou hast gone, because longing 
thou hast longed toward thy father's house; wherefore hast thou stolen my gods?      31. And Jacob answered and said to Laban, Because I was afraid, for I said, Perchance thou wilt take away thy 
daughters from me by force.      32. With whomsoever thou findest thy gods, he shall not live before our brethren; search thou what is with me, and take it to thee. And Jacob knew not that Rachel had 
stolen them.      33. And Laban came into Jacob's tent, and into Leah's tent, and into the tent of the two handmaids, and found them not; and he went out of Leah's tent, and came into Rachel's tent.  
    34. And Rachel had taken the teraphim, and put them in the camel's straw, and sat upon them; and Laban felt about all the tent, and found them not.      35. And she said to her father, Let there 
not be anger in the eyes of my lord, that I cannot rise up before thee, for the way of women is upon me. And he searched and found not the teraphim.      36. And Jacob was wroth, and chode with Laban; 
and Jacob answered and said to Laban, What is my trespass? What is my sin, in that thou hast hotly pursued after me?      37. Whereas thou hast felt about all my vessels, what hast thou found of 
all the vessels of thy house? Set it here before my brethren and thy brethren, and let them judge between us two.      38. These twenty years have I been with thee, thy sheep and thy she-goats have 
not cast their young, and the rams of thy flock have I not eaten.      39. The torn I brought not unto thee, I bare the loss of it, from my hand didst thou require it, whether stolen by day or stolen 
by night.      40. Thus I was; in the day the heat consumed me, and the cold in the night, and my sleep has been chased from mine eyes.      41. These twenty years have I served thee in thy house, 
fourteen years for thy two daughters, and six years for thy flock, and thou hast changed my reward ten ways.      42. Except the God of my father, the God of Abraham, and the Dread of Isaac, had been 
with me, surely now hadst thou sent me away empty. God hath seen my misery and the weariness of my hands, and judged yesternight.      43. And Laban answered, and said unto Jacob, The daughters are 
my daughters, and the sons are my sons, and the flock is my flock, and all that thou seest is mine; and what can I do this day unto these my daughters, or unto their sons which they have borne?     
 44. And now come, let us make a covenant, I and thou, and let it be for a witness between me and thee.      45. And Jacob took a stone, and set it up for a pillar.      46. And Jacob said unto his 
brethren, Gather stones; and they took stones, and made a heap, and they did eat there upon the heap.      47. And Laban called it Jegar-sahadutha, and Jacob called it Galeed.      48. And Laban said, 
This heap is a witness between me and thee this day; therefore he called the name of it Galeed; </p>
<p>     49. And Mizpah; for he said, Jehovah watch between me and thee, for we shall be hidden a man from 
his fellow.      50. If thou shalt afflict my daughters, and if thou shalt take women over my daughters, there is no man with us; see God is witness between me and thee.      51. And Laban said to 
Jacob, Behold this heap, and behold the pillar which I have set up between me and thee.      52. This heap be witness, and the pillar be witness, that I will not pass over this heap to thee, and that 
thou shalt not pass over this heap to me, and this pillar, for evil.      53. The God of Abraham and the God of Nahor judge between us, the God of their father; and Jacob swear by the Dread of his 
father Isaac.      54. And Jacob sacrificed a sacrifice in the mountain, and called his brethren to eat bread; and they did eat bread, and tarried all night in the mountain.      55. And in the morning 
Laban arose early, and kissed his sons and his daughters, and blessed them; and Laban departed and returned to his place. </p>

Therefore the words quoted above [in <a href="4056.htm">4056</a>] mean the state of the Church at that time as regards good, that is, as regards charity towards the neighbour and love to the Lord. This is clear from the internal 
sense of these words, which is as follows: </p>
<p> But immediately after the affliction of those days means the state of the Church as regards the truth of faith, which is dealt with in the verses immediately 
before this. In the Word desolation of truth is called 'affliction' in various places - 'days' being states, see <a href="23.htm">23</a>, <a href="487.htm">487</a>, <a href="488.htm">488</a>, <a href="493.htm">493</a>, <a href="893.htm">893</a>, <a href="2788.htm">2788</a>, <a href="3462.htm">3462</a>, <a href="3785.htm">3785</a>. From this it is evident that these 
words mean that once faith no longer exists neither will any charity exist. For faith leads to charity because it teaches what charity is, and charity acquires its particular character from the truths 
of faith. The truths of faith however receive their essence and life from charity, as has been shown many times in previous volumes. </p>
<p></p>
<p><b>[2]</b>
 The sun will be darkened, and the moon will not give its light 
means love to the Lord, which is 'the sun', and charity towards the neighbour, which is 'the moon'. 'Being darkened' and 'not giving light' mean that that love and charity will not be in evidence 
and so will disappear. For 'the sun' means the celestial kind of love and 'the moon' the spiritual kind; that is, 'the sun' means love to the Lord, and 'the moon' charily towards the neighbour which 
comes through faith, see <a href="1053.htm">1053</a>, <a href="1529.htm">1529</a>, <a href="1530.htm">1530</a>, <a href="2120.htm">2120</a>, <a href="2441.htm">2441</a>, <a href="2495.htm">2495</a>. The reason why the sun and the moon have these meanings is that the Lord is seen in the next life as a sun by those in heaven who are governed 
by love to Him and are called celestial, and as a moon by those who are governed by charity towards the neighbour and are referred to as spiritual, see <a href="1053.htm">1053</a>, <a href="1521.htm">1521</a>, <a href="1529.htm">1529</a>-<a href="1531.htm">1531</a>, <a href="3636.htm">3636</a>, <a href="3643.htm">3643</a>. </p>

sun and the moon in heaven, or the Lord, are never darkened, nor do they lose their light but are shining unceasingly. Thus in heaven there is no darkening or loss of light in the love which celestial 
angels have for the Lord or in the charity which spiritual angels show towards the neighbour. Nor on earth is there any in people with whom angels are present, that is, in people who are governed by 
love and charity. But those who are not governed by any love or charity, only by self-love and love of the world, and consequently by feelings of hatred and revenge, bring that kind of obscurity to 
themselves. It is like the sun of this world which is shining constantly; yet when clouds intervene the sun is not visible, see <a href="2441.htm">2441</a>. </p>
<p></p>
<p><b>[4]</b>
 And the stars will fall from heaven means that cognitions of 
good and truth will perish. When mentioned in the Word 'stars' have no other meaning than those cognitions, <a href="1808.htm">1808</a>, <a href="2849.htm">2849</a>. </p>
<p>And the powers of the heavens will be shaken means the foundations of the Church 
which are said to be shaken and jolted when those cognitions perish. This is because the Church on earth is heaven's foundation; for the influx of good and truth from the Lord through the heavens 
culminates ultimately in the goods and truths present with the member of the Church. Consequently when the state of the member of the Church is so perverse that he no longer allows good or truth to 
flow into him 'the powers of the heavens' are in that case said 'to be shaken'. That being so, the Lord always provides for some vestige of the Church to be left. And when the old Church perishes a new 
one is established. </p>

<p><b>[5]</b>
 And then the sign of the Son of Man will appear in heaven means the manifestation of Divine truth - 'sign' meaning a manifestation, 'the Son of Man' the Lord as regards Divine 
truth, see <a href="2803.htm">2803</a>, <a href="2813.htm">2813</a>, <a href="3704.htm">3704</a>. This manifestation, or this 'sign', is what the disciples asked for when they said to the Lord, </p>
<blockquote>
Tell us, when will those things take place; what especially will be 
the sign of Your coming and of the close of the age? <a href="http://bible.gospelcom.net/cgi-bin/bible?passage=Matt%2024:3&amp;version=ESV&amp;interface=print&amp;showfn=yes&amp;showxref">Matt 24:3</a>. 
</blockquote>
<p>For they knew from the Word that when the age drew to a close the Lord would come, and they knew from the Lord that He would be coming 
again, by which they understood the Lord's coming a second time into the world since they were not yet aware of the fact that the Lord had come as often as the Church had been brought to ruin. Not 
that any of these comings had been a coming in person, as was the case when, through birth in the world, He took on the Human and made this Divine. Rather, those comings had been made through appearances 
or manifestations of Himself, such as when He appeared in Mamre to Abraham, in the bush to Moses, on Mount Sinai to the Israelites, and to Joshua when he entered the land of Canaan. There were other 
comings of a less visible nature, such as those at times when inspiration was received and the Word was given by means of it, and later on through the Word itself. For the Word has the Lord present 
within it; every detail there comes from Him and has reference to Him, as may be recognized from what has been shown many times up to now. This is the kind of appearance that is meant here by 'the sign 
of the Son of Man' and is the subject in the present verse under consideration. </p>
<p></p>
<p><b>[6]</b>
 And then all the tribes of the earth will mourn means that all in whom the good of love and the truth of faith 
dwell will experience grief. This is what is meant by 'mourning', see <a href="http://bible.gospelcom.net/cgi-bin/bible?passage=Zech%2012:10-14&amp;version=ESV&amp;interface=print&amp;showfn=yes&amp;showxref">Zech 12:10-14</a>; and 'the tribes' means all aspects of good and truth, that is, of love and faith, <a href="3858.htm">3858</a>, <a href="3926.htm">3926</a>, and so consequently 
those in whom these things dwell. The phrase 'the tribes of the earth' is used because those inside the Church are meant - 'the earth' being the Church, see <a href="662.htm">662</a>, <a href="1066.htm">1066</a>, <a href="1067.htm">1067</a>, <a href="1262.htm">1262</a>, <a href="1733.htm">1733</a>, <a href="1850.htm">1850</a>, <a href="2117.htm">2117</a>, <a href="2928.htm">2928</a>, </p>
<p></p>
<p><b>[7]</b>
 And they will see the Son of Man coming in the clouds of heaven with power and great glory means that at that time a revelation of the internal sense of the Word - the sense in which the 
Lord is present - will take place. 'The Son of Man' means Divine truth within the Word, <a href="2803.htm">2803</a>, <a href="2813.htm">2813</a>, <a href="3704.htm">3704</a>, 'the clouds' the literal sense. 'Power' has reference to the good and 'glory' to the truth present 
there. For this meaning of 'seeing the Son of Man coming in the clouds of heaven', see Preface to Gen. <a href="18.htm">18</a>. This is the kind of coming of the Lord that is meant here, not a literal manifestation of 
Him in clouds. Next follows a reference to the establishment of a new Church, which takes place once the old has been brought to ruin and cast aside. </p>
<p></p>
<p><b>[8]</b>
 He will send out His angels with a trumpet 
and a loud voice means election - not by visible angels, still less by trumpets and by loud voices, but by an influx of holy good and of holy truth from the Lord through angels, so that the expression 
'angels' in the Word means something essentially the Lord's, <a href="1925.htm">1925</a>, <a href="2821.htm">2821</a>, <a href="3039.htm">3039</a>. In this instance it means things which come from the Lord and have reference to the Lord. 'A trumpet and a loud voice' 
means the proclamation of the Gospel, as in other places in the Word. </p>
<p></p>
<p><b>[9]</b>
 And they will gather the elect from the four winds, from one end of the heavens to the other end of them means the establishment 
of a new Church, 'the elect' being people in whom the good of love and faith dwell, <a href="3755.htm">3755</a> (end), <a href="3900.htm">3900</a>, 'the four winds' from which they will be gathered being all states of good and truth, <a href="3708.htm">3708</a>, 
and 'one end of the heavens to the other' the internal and the external features of the Church. These are the considerations that are meant by these words spoken by the Lord. </p>

Quod itaque per illa verba quae allata sunt, significetur status Ecclesiae tunc quoad bonum, hoc est, quoad charitatem erga proximum et amorem in Dominum, constat ex sensu interno illorum verborum, 
qui hic.  Statim autem post afflictionem dierum istorum {1} significat statum Ecclesiae quoad verum quod fidei, de quo in mox praecedentibus agitur; desolatio veri in Verbo passim vocatur `afflictio' 
quod `dies' sint status, videatur n. 23, 487, 488, 493, 893, 2788, 3462, 3785; inde patet quod per illa verba significetur, postquam nulla amplius fides, quod nulla erit charitas {2}; fides enim 
ducit ad charitatem quia docet quid charitas, et charitas accipit suum quale a veris qua fidei, at {3} fidei vera suam essentiam et suam vitam a charitate, ut in Partibus quae praecedunt, pluries 
ostensum (o)est.  Sol obscurabitur, et luna non dabit lumen suum significat amorem in Dominum qui est `sol,' et charitatem erga proximum quae est `luna'; `obscurari et non dare lumen' significat 
quod non apparitura, ita quod evanitura; quod `sol' sit caeleste amoris, et `luna' spirituale amoris, hoc est, quod `sol' sit amor in Dominum, et `luna' charitas erga proximum quae per fidem, videatur 
n. 1053, 1529, 1530, 2120, 2441, 2495; </p>
<p>causa quod illa significatio solis et lunae sit, est quia Dominus in altera vita apparet ut sol illis in caelo qui in amore in Ipsum sunt, qui caelestes 
vocantur, et ut luna illis qui in charitate erga proximum sunt, qui spirituales dicuntur, videatur n. 1053, 1521, 1529-1531, 3636, 3643.  [3] Sol et luna in caelis, seu Dominus, nusquam obscuratur, 
nec amittit lumen, sed perpetuo lucet, ita nec amor in Ipsum apud caelestes, et charitas erga proximum apud spirituales in caelis, nec in terris apud quos angeli illi sunt, hoc est, qui in amore et 
charitate; sed apud illos qui in nullo amore et charitate sunt sed in amore sui et mundi, et inde in odiis et vindictis, illi sibi ipsis obscurationem illam inducunt; </p>
<p>se habet hoc sicut cum sole 
mundi, sol perpetuo lucet, sed cum nubes se interponunt, {4} non apparet, videatur n. 2441.  [4] Et stellae cadent de caelo significat quod peribunt cognitiones boni et veri; in Verbo per `stellas' 
ubi nominantur, non aliud significatur, n. 1808, 2849.  Et potentiae caelorum commovebuntur significat fundamenta Ecclesiae, quae `commoveri et concuti' dicuntur cum {5} pereunt illa; Ecclesia enim 
in terris est fundamentum caeli, nam influxus boni et veri per caelos a Domino in bonis et veris quae apud hominem Ecclesiae, ultimo terminatur, quare cum homo Ecclesiae in tali perverso statu est, 
ut non admittat amplius influxum boni et veri, tunc `potentiae caelorum' dicuntur `commoveri'; quapropter semper providetur a Domino ut aliquid Ecclesiae remaneat, et cum Ecclesia vetus perit quod 
nova instauretur.  [5] Et tunc apparebit signum Filii hominis in caelo significat tunc apparitionem veri Divini; `signum' est apparitio, `Filius hominis' est Dominis quoad verum Divinum, videatur 
n. 2803, 2813, 3704; haec apparitio, seu hoc signum est, de quo quaesiverunt discipuli {6}, cum ad Dominum dicebant,           Dic nobis, quando ista fient, imprimis quodnam signum      Tui adventus, 
et consummationis saeculi, vers. 3 hujus      capitis; </p>
<p>norunt enim ex Verbo quod cum consummaretur saeculum, Dominus venturus, et norunt ex Domino quod iterum venturus, et intellexerunt per 
id quod Dominus in mundum denuo veniret, nondum scientes quod Dominus toties venerit quoties Ecclesia vastata fuit; </p>
<p>non quod in persona, sicut cum assumpsit Humanum per nativitatem et hoc Divinum fecit, 
sed per apparitiones vel manifestas quales cum apparuit Abrahamo in Mamre, Mosi in rubo, populo Israelitico in monte Sinai, Joshuae cum intravit terram Canaanem; vel per non ita manifestas, ut 
per inspirationes per quas Verbum; et dein per Verbum, in Verbo enim est Dominus praesens, nam omnia Verbi ab Ipso et de Ipso sunt, ut constare potest ex illis quae multoties hactenus ostensa sunt; 
[6] haec apparitio est quae per `signum Filii hominis' hic significatur et de qua in hoc versu agitur.  Et tunc plangent omnes tribus terrae significat quod in dolore erunt omnes qui in bono amoris 
et vero fidei; quod `planctus' id significet, videatur apud Zach. xii (x)10-14; et quod `tribus' significent omnia boni et veri, seu amoris et fidei, n. 3858, 3926, consequenter eos qui in illis 
sunt; `tribus terrae' dicuntur quia significantur qui intra Ecclesiam; quod `terra' sit Ecclesia, videatur n. 662, 1066, 1067, 1262, 1733, 1850, 2117, 2928, 3355.  Et videbunt Filium hominis venientem 
in nubibus caelorum cum potentia et gloria multa significat quod tunc revelabitur Verbum quoad sensum ejus internum in quo Dominus; `Filius hominis' est verum Divinum quod inibi, n. 2803, 2813, 
3704, `nubes' est sensus litteralis; `potentia' praedicatur de bono, et `gloria' de vero, quod ibi; quod illa significentur per `videre Filium hominis venientem in nubibus caelorum,' videatur Praefatio 
ad cap. xviii Gen.  Hic adventus Domini est qui hic intelligitur, non autem quod appariturus in nubibus secundum litteram; nunc sequitur de instauratione novae Ecclesiae, quae {7} fit cum vetus 
vastata et rejecta.  [8] Emittet angelos cum tuba et voce magna significat electionem non quod per angelos visibiles, minus per tubas et per voces magnas, sed per influxum sancti boni et sancti 
veri a Domino per angelos, quare per `angelos' in Verbo significatur aliquid Domini, n. 1925, 2821, 3039; hic significantur {8} quae ex Domino, et de Domino; per `tubam et vocem magnam' significatur evangelizatio, 
ut quoque alibi in Verbo.  [9] Et congregabunt electos a quatuor ventis, ab extremo caelorum usque ad extremum illorum significant instaurationem Ecclesiae novae; `electi' sunt qui 
in bono amoris et fidei, n. 3755 f, 3900; quatuor venti' a quibus congregabuntur, sunt omnes status boni et veri, n. 3708; </p>

<p>     1.  Et audivit verba filiorum 
Labanis, dicendo, Sumpsit Jacob omnia quae patri nostro, et a quibus patri nostro, fecit omnem copiam hanc.      2.  Et vidit Jacob facies Labanis, et ecce nullatenus is cum eo sicut heri 
nudius tertius.      3.  Et dixit JEHOVAH ad Jacobum, Revertere ad terram patrum tuorum, et ad nativitatem tuam, et ero cum te.      4.  Et misit Jacob et vocavit Rachelem et Leam agrum ad gregem suum.  
    5.  Et dixit illis, Video ego facies patris vestri, quod nullatenus is ad me sicut heri nudius tertius; et DEUS patris mei fuit cum me.      6.  Et vos scitis quod in omni vi mea servivi 
patri vestro.      7.  Et pater vester fefellit me, et mutavit mercedem meam decem modis, et non dedit ei DEUS ad malefaciendum mecum.      8.  Si sic dicebat, Punctata erit merces tua, et pepererunt omnes 
greges punctata; et si sic dicebat, Variegata erit merces tua, et pepererunt omnes greges variegata.      9.  Et eripuit DEUS acquisitionem patris vestri, et dedit mihi.      10.  Et factum 
in tempore incalescendi gregem, et sustuli oculos meos, et vidi in somnio, et ecce hirci ascendentes super gregem variegati, punctati et grandinati.      11.  Et dixit ad me angelus DEI in somnio, 
Jacob; et dixi, Ecce me.      12.  Et dixit, Tolle quaeso oculos tuos, et vide omnes hircos ascendentes super gregem variegatos, punctatos et grandinatos, quia vidi omne quod Laban facit tibi.  
    13.  Ego DEUS Bethelis, quo unxisti statuam, quo vovisti Mihi votum, nunc surge, exi e terra hac, et revertere ad terram nativitatis tuae.      14.  Et respondit Rachel et Leah, et dixerunt 
ei, An amplius nobis portio et hereditas in domo patris nostri?      15.  Annon alienae existimatae sumus ei, quia vendidit nos, et comedit etiam comedendo argentum nostrum?      16. Quia omnes 
divitiae, quas eripuit DEUS a patre nostro, nobis illae et filiis nostris; et nunc omne quod dixit DEUS ad te, fac.      17.  Et surrexit Jacob, et sustulit filios suos, et feminas sua super camelos.  
    18.  Et abduxit omnem acquisitionem suam, et omnem substantiam suam quam comparavit, acquisitionem emptionis suae quam comparavit in Paddan Aram, ad veniendum ad Jishakum patrem suum terram 
Canaan.      19.  Et Laban iverat ad tondendum gregem suum, et furati Rachel teraphim qui patri suo.      20.  Et furatus Jacob cor Labanis Aramaei, per quod non indicavi ei, quod fugiens is.  
    21.  Et fugit is, et omne quod ei, et surrexit, et transivit fluvium et posuit facies suas montem Gilead.      22.  Et indicatum Labani in die tertio, quod fugit Jacob.      23.  Et accepit fratres 
suos secum, et persecutus post eum via septem dierum, et adjunxit eum in monte Gilead.      24.  Et venit DEUS ad Labanem Aramaeum in somnio noctu, et dixit ei, Cave tibi ne forte loquaris cum 
Jacobo a bono usque ad malum.      25.  Et assecutus Laban Jacobum, et Jacob fixit tentorium suum in monte, et Laban fixit cum fratribus suis in monte Gilead.      26.  Et dixit Laban Jacobo, Quid 
fecisti, et furatus es cor meum, et abduxisti filias meas, sicut captivas gladio?      27.  Quare occultasti ad fugiendum, et furatus es me, et non indicasti mihi? et miserim te in laetitia, et in 
canticis, in tympano, et in cithara.      28.  Et non permisisti mihi osculari filios meos, et filias meas, nunc stulte egisti faciendo.      29.  Sit DEO manus mea ad faciendum cum vobis malum, 
et DEUS patris vestri nocte praeterita dixit ad me, dicendo, Cave tibi a loquendo cum Jacobo a bono usque ad malum.      30.  Et nunc eundo ivisti, quia desiderando desideravisti ad domum patris 
tui; quare furatus es deos meos?      31. Et respondit Jacob et dixit Labani, Quia timui, quia dixi, Forte rapies filias tuas a mecum.      32.  Cum quo invenis deos tuos, non vivet coram fratribus nostris; 
lustra tibi quid mecum, et accipe tibi; et non scivit Jacob quod Rachel furata illos.      33.  Et venit Laban in tentorium Jacobi, et in tentorium Leae, et in tentorium ambarum ancillarum, 
et non invenit; et exivit e tentorio Leae et venit in tentorium Rachelis.      34.  Et Rachel accepit teraphim, et posuit illos in stramento cameli, et sedit super illis; et contrectabat Laban 
omne tentorium, et non invenit.      35.  Et dixit ad patrem suum, Ne succenseatur in oculis domini mei, quia non possum surgere a coram te, quia via feminarum mihi; </p>
<p>et scrutatus est, et non invenit 
teraphim.      36.  Et succensuit Jacobo, et jurgatus est in Labanem; et respondit Jacob et dixit Labani, Quae praevaricatio mea, quod peccatum meum, quod insecutus es post me?      37.  Quia contrectasti 
omnia vasa mea, quid invenisti ab omnibus vasis domus tuae? pone huc coram fratribus meis et fratribus illis, et dijudicent inter ambos nos.      38.  His viginti annis ego tecum; oves 
tuae et caprae tuae non abortiverunt, et arietes gregis tui non comedi.      39.  Discerptum non adduxi ad te, ego indemnificavi id, e manu mea requisivisti id, furatum die et furatum nocte.      
40.  Fui, in die comedit me aestus et frigus in nocte, et expulsus somnus meus ab oculis meis.      41.  His mihi viginti annis in domo tua servivi tibi, quatuordecim annis in duabus filiabus tuis, 
et sex annis in grege tuo, et mutavisti mercedem meam decem modis.      42.  Nisi DEUS patris mei, DEUS Abrahami et pavor Jishaki, fuisset mihi, quod nunc vacuum misisses me; miseriam meam et fatigationem 
volarum mearum vidit DEUS, et dijudicavit nocte praeterita.      43.  Et respondit Laban, et dixit ad Jacobum, Filiae filiae meae, et filii filii mei, et grex grex meus, et omne quod tu videns, 
mihi hoc; pepererunt?      44.  Et nunc ito, pangamus foedus ego et tu, et sit in testem inter me et inter te.      45.  Et accepit Jacob lapidem, et erexit illum in statuam.      46.  Et 
dixit Jacob fratribus suis, Colligite lapides; et acceperunt lapides, et fecerunt acervum; et comederunt ibi super acervo.      47.  Et vocavit illum Laban Jegar Sahadutha; et Jacob vocavit illum 
Galeed.      48.  Et dixit Laban, Acervus hic testis inter me et inter te hodie propterea vocavit nomen illius Galeed.      49.  Et Mizpah, quia dixit, Spectet JEHOVAH inter me et inter te quia latebimus 
vir a socio suo.      50.  Si affligas filias meas, et si accipias feminas supra filia meas, nullus vir nobiscum, vide; DEUS testis inter me et inter te.      51.  Et dixit Laban Jacobo, Ecce 
acervus hic, et ecce statu quam erexi inter me et inter te.      52.  Testis acervus hic, et testis statua, si ego non transibo ad te acervum hunc, et si tu non transibis ad me acervum hunc et statuam 
hanc, ad malum.      53. DEUS Abrahami, et Deus Nahoris judicent inter nos, DEUS patris eorum; et juravit Jacob in pavorem patris sui Jishaki.      54.  Et sacrificavit Jacob sacrificium in 
monte, et vocavit fratres suos ad comedendum panem, et comederunt panem, et pernoctaverunt in monte.      55.  Et mane surrexit Laban in matutino, et osculatus filios suos, et filias suas, et benedixit 
illis, et ivit, et reversus Laban ac locum suum. </p>
