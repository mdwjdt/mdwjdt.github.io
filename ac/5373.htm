<h4 align="center"></h4><p><strong>5373.</strong>“全地都往埃及去”表真理与良善被纳入教会的记忆知识。这从“地”的含义清楚可知。在圣言中，“地”具有各种含义：一般来说，它表示教会，因而表示属于教会的事物，也就是良善与真理；它因表示教会，故也表示教会成员，教会成员就是具体的教会；它因表示教会成员，故表示存在于他里面，即他心智里面的东西。正因如此，“埃及地”在各个地方都表示属世心智。然而，此处不是指埃及地，而是指整个地，因而是指教会事物，也就是良善与真理。“地”具有各种含义（参看<a href="620.htm">620</a>，<a href="636.htm">636</a>，<a href="2571.htm">2571</a>节）；它一般表示教会（<a href="566.htm">566</a>，<a href="662.htm">662</a>，<a href="1068.htm">1068</a>，<a href="1262.htm">1262</a>，<a href="1413.htm">1413</a>，<a href="1607.htm">1607</a>，<a href="1733.htm">1733</a>，<a href="1850.htm">1850</a>，<a href="2117.htm">2117</a>，<a href="2118.htm">2118</a>，<a href="2928.htm">2928</a>，<a href="3355.htm">3355</a>，<a href="3404.htm">3404</a>，<a href="4447.htm">4447</a>，<a href="4535.htm">4535</a>节）。<br />至于“全地都往埃及去”表示真理与良善被纳入记忆知识，这一点从“埃及”真正意义上的含义明显看出来，“埃及”是指记忆知识，因而是指记忆知识的事物（参看<a href="1164.htm">1164</a>，<a href="1165.htm">1165</a>，<a href="1186.htm">1186</a>，<a href="1462.htm">1462</a>节）；“埃及”正面意义上所表示的记忆知识是教会所知的知识（<a href="4749.htm">4749</a>，<a href="4964.htm">4964</a>，<a href="4966.htm">4966</a>节）。这就是这些话的含义，这一点不仅从不是用来简单指埃及地的“地”的含义，“埃及”真正意义上的含义，以及经上用复数形式说“全地都来”，还从内义中观念的实际顺序明显看出来。因为按照这个观念的顺序，接下来就是构成余剩的真理与良善被纳入记忆知识。<br />事实上，情况是这样：在人的属世层重生期间，良善与真理的每一个形式都被纳入那里的记忆知识。凡不在这些记忆知识里的，都不在属世层中。这是因为属世心智中受理解力部分支配的部分唯独由记忆知识构成。属于属世层的记忆知识是次序的最后和最低层级。在先之物必须存在于那最后和最低层级中，以便在那个领域产生并显现。更重要的是，一切在先之物都会延伸到它们的最后和最低形式，这些形式作为它们的边界或最终界限而服务于它们。在先之物同时在那最低层面产生，正如原因同时在它们的结果里面产生，或高层事物同时在作为盛纳它们的器皿的低层事物中产生。属世层的记忆知识就是这类最后和最低的事物。正因如此，灵界终止于人的属世层，其中灵界事物以代表的形式显现。属灵事物若不以代表的形式，因而通过诸如存在于世上的事物显现在属世层里面，根本就不会被人理解。由此明显可知，在属世层重生期间，源于灵界的一切内层真理与良善都被纳入记忆知识，以使它们能够显现。</p>

And all the earth came into Egypt. That this signifies that goods and truths were brought into the memory-knowledges of the church, is evident from the signification of the "earth." The signification 
of "earth" or "land" in the Word is various: in general it signifies the church, and hence the things belonging to the church, which are goods and truths; and because it signifies the church, it signifies 
also the man of the church, for he is the church in particular; and because it signifies the man of the church, it signifies that in him which is the man, namely, the mind. Hence it is that by the 
"land of Egypt" is occasionally above signified the natural mind. In this passage, however, the land of Egypt is not meant, but the earth in general, consequently the things of the church, which are 
goods and truths. (That the signification of "land" or "earth" is various may be seen above, n. 620, 636, 2571; and that in general it signifies the church, n. 566, 662, 1068, 1262, 1413, 1607, 1733, 
1850, 2117, 2118, 2928, 3355, 3404, 4447, 4535.) [2] That by "all the earth coming to Egypt" is signified that goods and truths were brought into memory-knowledges is evident from the signification 
of "Egypt" in the proper sense, as being memory-knowledge, consequently matters of memory-knowledge (see n. 1164, 1165, 1186, 1462); and that the memory-knowledges signified in a good sense by "Egypt" 
are those of the church (n. 4749, 4964, 4966). That this is the internal sense of these words is plain not only from the signification of the word "earth" or "land" when the land of Egypt is not meant, 
and from that of "Egypt" in the proper sense, and from its being said, "all the earth came" [venerunt] in the plural, but also from the very connection of things in the internal sense; for in this 
connection it now follows that the truths and goods of remains are brought into memory-knowledges.  [3] For the case is this: during man's regeneration as to the natural, goods and truths are one and 
all brought together into memory-knowledges. Those which are not in the memory-knowledges there, are not in the natural; for the natural mind, as regards that part of it which is subject to the understanding, 
consists solely of memory-knowledges. The memory-knowledges that belong to the natural are the ultimates of order, and things prior must be in ultimates in order to come into existence and 
to appear in that sphere; and besides this all prior things tend to ultimates as to their boundaries or ends, and come into existence together therein as causes do in their effects, or as higher things 
do in lower as in their vessels. The memory-knowledges of the natural are such ultimates. Hence it is that the spiritual world is terminated in man's natural, in which the things of the spiritual world 
are representatively presented. Unless spiritual things were presented representatively in the natural, thus by such things as are in the world, they would not be apprehended at all. From all this 
it is evident that during the regeneration of the natural all interior truths and goods, which are from the spiritual world, are brought into memory-knowledges, in order that they may appear. </p>

'And all the earth came to Egypt' means that forms of good and truth were gathered into the facts known to the Church. This is clear from the meaning of 'the earth'. In the Word 'the earth' has various 
meanings, but in general it means the Church and also the things that constitute the Church, which are forms of good and truth. Also, because 'the earth' (or 'the land') means the Church it means the 
member of the Church as well since he is a Church on a particular level. And meaning a member of the Church, 'the earth' (or 'the land') means that which exists within him, namely his mind, which is 
why in various places above 'the land of Egypt' has meant the natural mind. Here however it is not the land of Egypt but the earth in general that is being referred to, and therefore those things that 
constitute the Church, which are forms of good and truth, are meant. For more about 'the earth' having various meanings, see <a href="620.htm">620</a>, <a href="636.htm">636</a>, <a href="2571.htm">2571</a>; but in general it means the Church, <a href="566.htm">566</a>, <a href="662.htm">662</a>, <a href="1067.htm">1067</a>, <a href="1262.htm">1262</a>, <a href="1413.htm">1413</a>, <a href="1607.htm">1607</a>, <a href="1733.htm">1733</a>, <a href="1850.htm">1850</a>, <a href="2117.htm">2117</a>, <a href="2118.htm">2118</a> (end), <a href="2928.htm">2928</a>, <a href="3755.htm">3755</a>, <a href="3404.htm">3404</a>, <a href="4447.htm">4447</a>, <a href="4535.htm">4535</a>. </p>
<p></p>
<p><b>[2]</b>
 As regards the phrase 'all the earth came to Egypt' meaning that forms of good and truth were gathered into the facts known 
to the Church, this is clear from the meaning of 'Egypt' in its proper sense as knowledge, and then as known facts, see <a href="1164.htm">1164</a>, <a href="1165.htm">1165</a>, <a href="1186.htm">1186</a>, <a href="1462.htm">1462</a>; and the facts meant by 'Egypt' in the good sense are 
the facts that are known to the Church, <a href="4749.htm">4749</a>, <a href="4964.htm">4964</a>, <a href="4966.htm">4966</a>. It is indeed evident from the meaning of the expressions that are used - from the meaning of 'the earth' or 'the land' when this is used not 
for simply the land of Egypt, and also from the meaning of 'Egypt' in its proper sense - that such is the internal meaning of 'all the earth came to Egypt'. And it is also evident from the fact that 
the verb 'came' in this phrase is plural. But in addition to this it is evident from the actual sequence of ideas present in the internal sense. For there now follows in that sequence of ideas the thought 
that the forms of truth and good constituting the remnants are gathered into known facts. </p>
<p></p>
<p><b>[3]</b>
 For the situation is this: When a person's natural is being regenerated every single form of good 
and truth is gathered into the known facts there. Any that are not present within these facts are not in the natural. This is because that part of the natural mind which is subject to the understanding 
part is made up solely of factual knowledge; and this knowledge present in the natural is the last and lowest degree of order. To come forth and manifest themselves in that sphere things that are prior 
must exist within ones that are last and lowest. More than this, prior things all extend into their last and lowest forms which serve them as their boundaries or final limits. Prior things come into 
being simultaneously on that lowest level, in the same way as causes do within their effects, or as higher objects do within lower ones that serve as vessels to contain them. The known facts present 
in the natural are such last and lowest things. This being so, the final limit that holds the spiritual world within it is man's natural, in which things existing in the spiritual world reveal themselves 
in the form of representations. If spiritual things did not reveal themselves within the natural in the form of representations, thus with the help of such things as exist in the world, no one could 
have any awareness of them at all. From these considerations one may see that when the natural is being regenerated every form of interior truth and good which has its origin in the spiritual world 
is gathered into known facts to enable it to manifest itself. </p>

`Et omnis terra venerunt Aegyptum': quod significet quod (t)bona et vera collata in scientifica quae Ecclesiae, constat ex significatione `terrae'; terrae significatio in Verbo est varia, in genere 
significat Ecclesiam, inde etiam illa quae sunt Ecclesiae, nempe bona et vera; et quia significat Ecclesiam, etiam significat hominem Ecclesiae, nam is est Ecclesia in particulari; et quia significat 
hominem Ecclesiae, significat id quod {1}homo est in illo, nempe mentem, inde est quod per `terram Aegypti' {2}supra passim significata sit mens naturalis {3}; hic autem non intelligitur terra Aegypti, 
sed terra in genere, proinde illa quae sunt Ecclesiae, quae sunt bona et vera; quod terrae significatio sit varia, videatur n. 620, 636, 2571; quod in genere significet Ecclesiam, n. 566, 662, 1067, 
1262, 1413, 1607, 1733, 1850, 2117, 2118 fin., 2928, 3355, 3404, 4447, 4535; [2] quod per `{4}omnis terra venerunt Aegyptum' significetur quod bona et vera collata sint in scientifica, constat ex significatione 
Aegypti in proprio sensu quod sit scientia, proinde scientifica, videatur n. 1164, 1165, 1186, 1462; et quod scientifica quae per Aegyptum significentur in bono sensu, sint scientifica Ecclesiae, 
n. 4749, 4964, 4966; quod hic sensus internus horum verborum sit, patet non modo a significatione vocum, nempe terrae cum non intelligitur terra Aegypti, et quoque Aegypti in proprio sensu, tum 
{5}quia dicitur in plurali, nempe `omnis terra venerunt', sed etiam ab ipso nexu rerum in sensu interno; in nexu enim nunc sequitur quod vera et bona reliquiarum conferantur in scientifica.  [3] Res 
enim ita se habet: cum regeneratur homo quoad naturale, bona et vera omnia et singula conferuntur in scientifica {6}; quae non in scientificis ibi sunt, non in naturali sunt, nam mens naturalis quoad 
illam partem quae subjecta est intellectuali, consistit solum ex scientificis; scientifica quae naturalis, sunt ultima ordinis; priora erunt in ultimis ut existant et appareant in illa sphaera; et praeterea 
(t)priora omnia tendunt {7} ad {8} ultima, ut ad suos terminos aut fines, et inibi simul existunt, sicut causae in suis effectibus, aut sicut superiora in {9}inferioribus, ut in suis vasibus; 
scientifica quae naturalis, talia ultima sunt{10}, inde est quod spiritualis mundus terminetur in naturali hominis, in quo illa quae spiritualis mundi sunt, repraesentative sistuntur; spiritualia nisi 
in naturali sisterentur repraesentative, ita per talia quae in mundo, nullatenus caperentur; ex his constare potest quod cum regeneratur naturale, omnia vera et bona interiora quae ex spirituali mundo 
sunt, conferantur in scientifica ut appareant. @1 hominis est$ @2 significetur$ @3 i ut supra passim$ @4 i quod$ @5 cum$ @6 i ibi$ @7 i usque$ @8 i sua$ @9 suis basibus$ @10 i in Regno spirituali$ </p>
