<h3 align="center" class="ired">属天的奥秘 第3853节</h3>
<h4 align="center"></h4><p><strong>3853.</strong>创世记29:31. 耶和华见利亚被恨，就开她的子宫，拉结却不生育。<br />“耶和华见”表主的预见和提供。“利亚被恨”表对外在真理的情感并不怎么珍贵，因为它离神性更远。“就开她的子宫”表这种情感产生教会的教义。“拉结却不生育”表内层真理不被接纳。</p>

Verse 31. And Jehovah saw that Leah was hated, and He opened her womb, and Rachel was barren. "And Jehovah saw," signifies the Lord's foresight and providence; "that Leah was hated," signifies that the 
affection of external truth was not so dear because further from the Divine; "and He opened her womb," signifies that thence came the doctrines of churches; "and Rachel was barren," signifies that 
interior truths were not received. </p>

Verse 31 And Jehovah saw that Leah was hated, and He opened her womb; and Rachel was barren. </p>
<p>'Jehovah saw' means the Lord's foresight and providence. 'That Leah was hated' means that the affection 
for external truth was not so dear because it was further away from the Divine. 'And He opened her womb' means that this affection gave rise to the doctrines taught by the Churches. 'And Rachel was barren' 
means that interior truths were not received. </p>

Vers. 31. Et vidit Jehovah quod exosa Leah, et aperuit uterum illius, et Rachel sterilis. `Vidit Jehovah' significat praevidentiam et providentiam Domini: `quod exosa Leah' significat quod {1}affectio 
veri externi non ita cara, quia longius a Divino: </p>
<p>`et aperuit uterum illius' significat quod inde doctrinae Ecclesiarum: `et Rachel sterilis' significat quod interiora vera non reciperentur. @1
