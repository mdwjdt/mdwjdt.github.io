<h3 align="center" class="ired">属天的奥秘 第4839节</h3>
<h4 align="center"></h4><p><strong>4839.</strong>“俄南所作的在耶和华眼中看为恶”表这违反神性次序。这从“在耶和华眼中看为恶”或反对祂的邪恶的含义清楚可知，“在耶和华眼中看为恶”或反对祂的邪恶是指违背源于祂的次序之物。这一点既可从俄南的行为，也可从关于丈夫弟兄的律例看出来；该律例规定：他哥哥的妻当从他脚上脱下他的鞋，吐唾沫在他脸上；在以色列中，他的名必称为脱鞋之家（申命记<a href="http://39-27.cn/申25.8.htm">25:8</a>-<a href="http://39-27.cn/申25.10.htm">10</a>）。这些行为表示他没有良善，无论外在的还是内在的；那些没有良善，陷入邪恶的人违反神性次序。从内在邪恶，也就是从像俄南那样的邪恶意图或目的所涌出或流出的一切邪恶都违反神性次序。但是，凡不是从内在邪恶，也就是邪恶的意图或目的所涌出或流出之物，尽管有时看似邪恶，然而只要目的不是邪恶，它就不是邪恶；因为正是目的决定了每个行为的真正性质。目的含有人的生命在里面；也就是说，凡人所爱，因而所思的，他都以之为目的。其灵魂的生命并非别的。<br />谁都能知道，邪恶违反神性次序，良善符合神性次序。神性次序就是在天堂的主自己，因为来自祂的神性良善与神性真理构成次序，以致它们就是次序；神性良善是它的本质，神性真理则是它的形式。当以可见的形式被呈现出来时，神性次序看似一个人，因为唯独产生它的主是人（<a href="49.htm">49</a>，<a href="288.htm">288</a>，<a href="477.htm">477</a>，<a href="565.htm">565</a>，<a href="1871.htm">1871</a>，<a href="1894.htm">1894</a>，<a href="3638.htm">3638</a>，<a href="3639.htm">3639</a>节）。天使、灵人和世人越接受祂，也就是说，越处于良善并因此处于真理，因而越处于其神性次序，他们就越是人。正因如此，整个天堂呈现为一个人，被称为大人，并且人里面的每一个事物都与它相对应，这在各章的末尾有所说明。这也解释了为何天堂里的所有天使呈现为人形；而另一方面，地狱里的恶灵尽管出于幻觉在彼此眼里看似人，但在天堂之光中却看似怪物，并照着他们所陷入的邪恶而愈加狰狞恐怖（<a href="4533.htm">4533</a>节）。其原因在于，邪恶本身违反次序，因而违反人的形式。因为如前所述，当以可见形式被呈现出来时，神性次序看似一个人。</p>

And that which he did was evil in the eyes of Jehovah. That this signifies that it was contrary to the Divine order, is evident from the signification of "evil in the eyes of Jehovah," or evil against 
Him, as being what is contrary to the order which is from Him. This appears also from the deed, and likewise from the statute in regard to the husband's brother, namely, that his brother's wife should 
take his shoe from off his foot, and spit in his face, and that his name should be called in Israel, The house of him that hath his shoe taken off (Deut. 25:8-10), whereby was signified that he was 
without good external or internal; and they who are without good, and are in evil, are against Divine order. All that evil which springs or flows forth from interior evil (that is, from the intention 
or end of evil, such as was this of Onan's), is contrary to Divine order; but that which does not spring or flow forth from interior evil, that is, from an intention or end of evil, though it sometimes 
appears like evil, yet is not so, provided the end is not evil, for the end qualifies every deed. For man's life is in his end, because what he loves and thence thinks, he has for his end; the life 
of his soul being nothing else. [2] Everyone is able to know that evil is contrary to Divine order, and good according to it; for Divine order is the Lord Himself in heaven, because the Divine good 
and truth which are from Him constitute order, insomuch that they are order, Divine good its essential, and Divine truth its formal. When Divine order is represented in form it appears as a man; for the 
Lord, from whom it is, is the only Man (n. 49, 288, 477, 565, 1871, 1894, 3638, 3639); and insofar as angels, spirits, and men receive from Him, that is, insofar as they are in good and thence in truth, 
thus insofar as they are in His Divine order, so far they are men. From this it is that the universal heaven represents one man, which is called the Grand Man, and that the whole and every part 
of man corresponds thereto, as has been shown at the end of the chapters. From this also it is that the angels in heaven all appear in the human form; and that, on the other hand, the evil spirits who 
are in hell, though from fantasy they appear to one another like men, in the light of heaven appear as monsters, more dire and horrible according to the evil in which they are (n. 4533); and this because 
evil itself is contrary to order, and thus contrary to the human form; for as before said the Divine order when represented in form appears as a man. </p>

'And what he had done was evil in the eyes of Jehovah' means that it was contrary to Divine order. This is clear from the meaning of 'evil in the eyes of Jehovah', or evil contrary to Him, as that which 
is contrary to the order originating in Him. This is evident both from what Onan actually did and from what was laid down regarding a husband's brother - the sister-in-law was required to remove the 
shoe from his foot and to spit in his face; and his name in Israel was to be called, The house of him that has his shoe taken off, <a href="http://bible.gospelcom.net/cgi-bin/bible?passage=Deut%2025:8-10&amp;version=ESV&amp;interface=print&amp;showfn=yes&amp;showxref">Deut 25:8-10</a>. These actions meant that he was devoid of good, external 
and internal; and those who are devoid of that good and are governed by evil are contrary to Divine order. All evil that wells up or flows from evil present interiorly - that is, which, like Onan's, 
is intentional or has an evil end in view- is contrary to Divine order. But that which does not well up or flow from evil present interiorly - that is, which is unintentional or has no evil end in 
view - may sometimes look like evil but is not in fact this if the end in view is not an evil one; for it is the end that determines the true nature of every action. The end holds a person's life within 
it; that is to say, what a person loves and consequently thinks he has as his end in view. The life of his soul is nothing else. </p>

 Everyone realizes that evil is contrary to Divine order and 
good is in keeping with it. Divine Order is the Lord Himself in heaven, for Divine Good and Truth received from Him constitute order. They do this so completely that they are order, Divine Good being 
the essential element of it and Divine Truth the form given to this. When represented in a visible shape Divine order is seen as a Human Being, for the Lord alone who is the producer of it is Man, <a href="49.htm">49</a>, <a href="288.htm">288</a>, <a href="477.htm">477</a>, <a href="565.htm">565</a>, <a href="1871.htm">1871</a>, <a href="1894.htm">1894</a>, <a href="3638.htm">3638</a>, <a href="3639.htm">3639</a>. And insofar as angels, spirits, and men are recipients of Him, that is, insofar as good and accompanying truth are present in them, thus insofar as His Divine 
order is present there, they are human beings. This is the reason why the whole of heaven represents one complete human being, called the Grand Man, and every single thing in the human being corresponds 
to it, as has been shown at the ends of chapters. It also explains why all the angels in heaven are seen in a human shape; but evil spirits on the other hand are deluded into seeing one another as 
human beings, whereas in the light of heaven they look like monsters, ever more dreadful and horrid, depending on the evil which governs them, <a href="4533.htm">4533</a>. The reason for this is that evil itself is contrary 
to order and so contrary to the human form. For as has been stated, when represented in a visible form, Divine order looks like a human being </p>

`Et fuit malum in oculis Jehovae quod fecit': quod significet quod contra ordinem Divinum, constat ex significatione `mali in oculis Jehovae' seu mali contra Ipsum, quod sit contra ordinem qui ab 
ipso; id quoque patet e facto, et quoque {1} ex statuto de leviratu, quod nempe `fratria extraheret calceum ex pede ejus, et exspueret in faciem ejus' et quod `nomen ejus (o)in Israele vocaretur domus 
exuti calceum', Deut. xxv 8-10, quibus significatum quod esset absque bono externo et interno, et qui absque illo sunt et in malo, contra ordinem Divinum sunt.  Omne id malum est contra ordinem 
Divinum quod scaturit seu effluit ex malo interius, hoc est, ex intentione seu fine mali, quale hoc Omnis; at quod non scaturit seu effluit ex malo interius, hoc est, ex intentione seu fine mali, 
hoc quandoque apparet sicut malum, sed usque non est si finis non malus est, nam finis qualificat omne factum; in fine enim est vita hominis, quippe quod amat et inde cogitat homo, pro fine habet; 
vita ejus animae non aliud est. {2} [2] Quod malum sit contra ordinem Divinum et bonum secundum illum, cuivis potest notum esse; ordo enim Divinus est Ipse Dominus in caelo, Divinum enim Bonum ac Verum 
quod ab Ipso, constituit ordinem, usque adeo ut sint ordo, Divinum Bonum essentiale ejus, et Divinum Verum formale; Divinus ordo cum repraesentatur in forma, apparet sicut Homo, Dominus enim a 
Quo est, est Solus Homo, n. 49, 288, 477, 565, 1871, 1894, 3638, 3639; et quantum angeli, spiritus et homines ab Ipso habent, hoc est, quantum in bono et inde vero sunt, ita quantum in Divino Ipsius 
ordine, tantum sunt homines; </p>
<p>inde est quod universum caelum repraesentet Unum Hominem, qui Maximus Homo vocatur, et quod ei correspondeant omnia et singula quae apud hominem, sicut ad finem capitum 
ostensum est; inde etiam est quod angeli in caelo appareant omnes in forma humana; et {3} vicissim spiritus mali qui in inferno {4}, inter se quidem apparent ex phantasia ut homines, sed in luce 
caeli sicut monstra, diriora et horribiliora secundum malum in quo sunt, n. 4533, et hoc ex causa quia ipsum malum est contra ordinem, ita contra humanam formam, nam, ut dictum, Divinus ordo cum 
repraesentatur in forma, apparet sicut homo.      @1 tum$      @2 In A n. 4840 follows, but it is followed by remainder of 4839 with directions for insertion here.$      @3 at$      @4  sunt$ </p>
