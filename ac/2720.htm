<h4 align="center"></h4><p><strong>2720.</strong>创世记21:22.当那时候，亚比米勒同他军长非各对亚伯拉罕说话，说，凡你所行的，神都与你同在。<br />23.如今请在这里指着神向我起誓，不要以诈伪待我与我的儿子，并我的子孙，我怎样厚待了你，你也要照样厚待我与你所寄居的这地。<br />24.亚伯拉罕说，我情愿起誓。<br />25.亚伯拉罕指责亚比米勒，因为亚比米勒的仆人霸占了一口水井。<br />26.亚比米勒说，谁作了这事，我都不知道，你也没有告诉我，我也没有听见，到今天才听见。<br />27.亚伯拉罕把羊和牛给了亚比米勒，他们二人就立了约。<br />28.亚伯拉罕把羊群中七只母羊羔独自放在一处。<br />29.亚比米勒对亚伯拉罕说，你把这七只母羊羔独自放在一处，是什么意思呢？<br />30.他说，你要从我手里受这七只母羊羔，作我挖这口井的证据。<br />31.所以他称那地方为别是巴，因为他们二人在那里起了誓。<br />32.他们在别是巴立了约，亚比米勒就同他军长非各起身回非利士地去了。<br />“当那时候”表当主的理性变成神性之时主所处的状态。“亚比米勒同他军长非各对亚伯拉罕说话”表基于记忆知识的人类理性事物，它们要与本为神性的信之教义联结。“说，凡你所行的，神都与你同在”表它就是存在于万事万物中的神性，无论总体还是细节。<br />“如今请在这里指着神向我起誓”表肯定。“不要以诈伪待我”表毫无疑问。“待我的儿子，并我的子孙”表关于信的事物。“我怎样厚待了你”表主以前被教导的理性事物。“你也要照样厚待我与你所寄居的这地”表这是相互的。<br />“亚伯拉罕说，我情愿起誓”表完全肯定。“亚伯拉罕指责亚比米勒”表主的不悦。“因为亚比米勒的仆人霸占了一口水井”表信之教义，记忆知识渴望将这教义归给自己。<br />“亚比米勒说”表回答。“谁作了这事，我都不知道”表理性指使了不同的事。“你也没有告诉我”表这事并非出于神性。“我也没有听见，到今天才听见”表现在它才被披露出来。<br />“亚伯拉罕把羊和牛给了亚比米勒”表神性良善被植入在属于“亚比米勒”所表示的教义的理性事物中。“他们二人就立了约”表就这样联结起来。“亚伯拉罕把羊群中七只母羊羔独自放在一处”表纯真的圣洁。<br />“亚比米勒对亚伯拉罕说，你把这七只母羊羔独自放在一处，是什么意思呢”表祂要接受教导，并且必会承认。“他说，你要从我手里受这七只母羊羔”表纯真的圣洁来自神性。“作我的证据”表确定。“挖这口井”表这教义来自神性。<br />“所以他称那地方为别是巴”表这教义的状态和性质。“因为他们二人在那里起了誓”表由于联结。“他们在别是巴立了约”表纯人类理性事物与信之教义联结。“亚比米勒就同他军长非各起身回非利士地去了”表尽管如此，这些事物仍不会形成这教义的一部分。</p>

Verse 22. And it came to pass at that time, that Abimelech, and Phicol the captain of his army, said unto Abraham, saying, God is with thee in all that thou doest. Verse 23. And now swear unto me here 
by God, that thou wilt not be false to me, nor to my son, nor to my son's son; according to the kindness that I have done unto thee, thou shalt do unto me, and to the land wherein thou hast sojourned. 
Verse 24. And Abraham said, I will swear. Verse 25. And Abraham reproved Abimelech, because of the well of water which Abimelech's servants had taken away. Verse 26. And Abimelech said, I know not 
who hath done this word, neither didst thou tell me, neither heard I of it but today. Verse 27. And Abraham took flock and herd, and gave to Abimelech, and they two struck a covenant. Verse 28. And Abraham 
set seven ewe lambs of the flock by themselves. Verse 29. And Abimelech said unto Abraham, What are these seven ewe lambs which thou hast set by themselves? Verse 30. And he said, Because these 
seven ewe lambs shalt thou take of my hand, that it may be a witness unto me that I have digged this well. Verse 31. Therefore he called that place Beersheba, because there they sware, both of them. Verse 
32. And they struck a covenant at Beersheba; and Abimelech rose up, and Phicol the captain of his army; and they returned into the land of the Philistines. [2] "It came to pass at that time" signifies 
the state in which the Lord was when His rational was made Divine; "and Abimelech, and Phicol the captain of his army, said unto Abraham" signifies the human rational things from memory-knowledges 
that were to be adjoined to the doctrine of faith, which in itself is Divine; "saying, God is with thee in all that thou doest" signifies that it was Divine as to all things both in general and in 
particular. [3] "And now swear unto me here by God" signifies affirmation; "that thou wilt not be false to me" signifies without a doubt; "nor to my son, nor to my son's son" signifies concerning the 
things of faith; "according to the kindness that I have done unto thee" signifies the rational things in which the Lord had been previously instructed; "thou shalt do unto me and to the land wherein 
thou hast sojourned" signifies what is reciprocal. [4] "And Abraham said, I will swear" signifies all that is affirmative. "And Abraham reproved Abimelech" signifies the Lord's indignation; "because 
of the well of water which Abimelech's servants had taken away" signifies as to the doctrine of faith, that the memory-knowledges desired to attribute it to themselves. [5] "And Abimelech said" signifies 
a reply. "I know not who hath done this word" signifies that the rational dictated something different; "neither didst thou tell me" signifies that it was not from the Divine; "neither heard I of 
it but today" signifies that it was now first disclosed. [6] "And Abraham took flock and herd, and gave to Abimelech" signifies the Divine goods implanted in the rational things of doctrine signified 
by "Abimelech"; "and they two struck a covenant" signifies conjunction thus. "And Abraham set seven ewe lambs of the flock by themselves" signifies the holiness of innocence. [7] "And Abimelech said 
unto Abraham, What are these seven ewe lambs which thou hast set by themselves" signifies that he should be instructed and would acknowledge. "And he said, Because these seven ewe lambs shalt thou 
take of my hand" signifies that the holiness of innocence is from the Divine; "that it may be a witness unto me" signifies certainty; "that I have digged this well" signifies that the doctrine was from 
the Divine. "Therefore he called that place Beersheba" signifies the state and quality of the doctrine; "because there they sware both of them" signifies from the conjunction. [8] "And they struck 
a covenant in Beersheba" signifies that human rational things were adjoined to the doctrine of faith; "and Abimelech rose up, and Phicol the captain of his army, and they returned into the land of the 
Philistines" signifies that nevertheless these things had no part in the doctrine. </p>

Verse 22 And so it was at that time, that Abimelech spoke, and Phicol the general of his army, to Abraham, saying, God is with you in all that you are doing. </p>
<p>Verse 23 And now swear to me here by God

said, I will swear. </p>
<p>Verse 25 And Abraham reproached Abimelech on account of a well of water which Abimelech's servants had seized. </p>

thing; and you also did not point it out to me, and I too have not heard about it until today. </p>
<p>Verse 27 And Abraham took flocks and herds and gave them to Abimelech; and the two of them made a covenant. </p>
<p>Verse 28 And Abraham set seven ewe-lambs of the flock by themselves. </p>

<p>Verse 30 
And he said, Because you will take the seven ewe-lambs from my hand, that they may be a witness for me that I dug this well. </p>

Vers. 22. Et fuit in tempore illo, et dixit Abimelech, et Phicol princeps exercitus ejus, ad Abrahamum, dicendo, Deus tecum in omnibus quae tu faciens. Vers. 23. Et nunc jura mihi in Deum hic, si mentitus 
fueris mihi, et filio meo, et nepoti meo; secundum benignitatem, quam feci tecum, facias mecum, et cum terra, in qua peregrinatus es.  Vers. 24. Et dixit Abraham, Ego jurabo.  Vers. 25.  Et redarguit 
Abraham Abimelechum, ob causas putei aquae, quem eripuerunt servi Abimelechi.  Vers. 26. Et dixit Abimelech, Non novi quis fecit verbum hoc, et etiam tu non indicasti mihi, et etiam ego non audivi, 
praeterquam hodie. Vers. 27. Et accepit Abraham gregem et armentum, et dedit Abimelecho, et percusserunt ambo illi foedus. Vers. 28. Et statuit Abraham septem agnas gregis solas eas. Vers. 29. Et 
dixit Abimelech ad Abrahamum, Quid hae septem agnae illae, quas statuisti solas?  Vers. 30. Et dixit, Quia septem agnas accipies e manu mea, propterea sit mihi in testimonium, quod fodi puteum hunc. 
 Vers. 31. Propterea vocavit locum illum Beersheba, quia ibi juraverunt ambo illi.  Vers. 32. Et percusserunt foedus in Beersheba; et surrexit Abimelech, et Phicol princeps exercitus illius; et reversi

omne: `Et redarguit Abraham Abimelechum' significat indignationem Domini: `ob causas putae aquae, quem eripuerunt servi Abimelechi' significat doctrinam fidei, quod illam scientifica sibi tribuere 
vellent: [5] `Et dixit Abimelech' significat responsum: `Non novi quis fecit verbum hoc' significat quod rationale aliud dictaret: `et etiam tu non indicasti mihi' significat quod non ex Divino 
illud: `et etiam ego non audivi, praeterquam hodie' significat quod nunc primum detectum: [6] `Et accepit Abraham gregem et armentum, et dedit Abimelecho' significat Divina bona implantata doctrinae
