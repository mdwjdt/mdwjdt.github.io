<h3 align="center" class="ired">属天的奥秘 第1883节</h3>
<h4 align="center"></h4><p><strong>1883.</strong>关于第一种异象，也就是出体，情况是这样：人进入一种半睡半醒的状态，在此状态下，人觉得他是完全清醒的，所有感觉都很敏锐，和肉体最清醒时一样，不仅有视觉、听觉，奇妙的是，还有触觉，而且比肉体清醒时敏锐得多。在此状态下，人清楚分明地看见灵人和天使，听见他们说话，甚至触摸他们，几乎没有肉体之物的干扰。这就是经上所说他们“魂游象外”，不知道“或在身内，或在身外”的状态。我仅有三、四次被引入这种状态，只是为了让我了解这种状态是何情形，并知道灵人和天使享有一切感觉，包括触觉，而且这触觉远比肉体的更精妙、细腻。</p>

<p><strong>[NCE]1883.</strong> The case with the first — being taken out of the body — is this: The person is brought into a certain condition midway between sleep and wakefulness. In this condition, the person is fully convinced that he or she is completely conscious. The person's senses are all as wide awake as they are when the body is fully alert — sight, hearing, and (amazingly) the sense of touch, which is keener now than it could ever be during physical wakefulness. During this state, I have also seen spirits and angels literally as big as life, and I have heard and even touched them, surprising to say. Hardly anything physical was involved.<br />This is the condition in which people are said to be taken out of the body and to have no idea whether they are in the body or out of the body [<a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_1883/bible_king-james-version_2-corinthians_12_2" target=_top>2 Corinthians 12:2</a>, <a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_1883/bible_king-james-version_2-corinthians_12_3" target=_top>3</a>].<br />Only three or four times have I come into this state, and then only to learn what it was like, and to see that spirits and angels enjoy sensation of every kind, even touch — a far better and far keener sense of touch than in the body. </p>
<p align="center"><b>Potts(1905-1910) 1883</b></p><p><b>1883.</b>
As regards the first, namely, being withdrawn from the body, the case is this. The man is brought into a certain state that is midway between sleep and wakefulness, and when he is in this state he cannot 
know but that he is wholly awake. All his senses are as fully awake as in the highest wakefulness of the body; the sight, the hearing, and, wonderful to say, the touch, which is then more exquisite 
than it can ever be in the wakefulness of the body. In this state also spirits and angels have been seen to the very life, and also heard, and, wonderful to say, have been touched, and almost nothing 
of the body then intervened. This is the state of which it is said that they are "withdrawn from the body," and that they "do not know whether they are in the body or out of it."* I have been let into 
this state only three or four times, merely that I might know how the case is with it, and that spirits and angels are in the enjoyment of every sense, even touch in a form more delicate and more 
exquisite than that of the body. * See 2 Cor. 12:3. </p>

<p align="center"><b>Elliott(1983-1999) 1883</b></p><p><b>1883.</b>
In the case of the first of these - described by 'being withdrawn from the body' - the person is brought into a certain state which comes halfway between sleep and wakefulness. While in this state he 
is not aware of being anything else than completely awake. All his senses are awake as much as they would be when the body is fully awake - both sight and hearing, and, it being a marvel, touch as well, 
which sense exists in a more excellent manner than it can ever do during wakefulness of the body. In this state also spirits and angels have been seen in complete reality; they have also been heard, 
and, wonderful to tell, have been touched, though at such times the body played scarcely any part at all. This is the state that is meant when it is said that people are 'withdrawn from the body', 
and that they do not know 'whether they are in the body or out of it'. Into this state I have been admitted on only three or four occasions, solely in order that I might know what that state is like and 
that spirits and angels are endowed with every sense, including touch, which surpasses, and is more excellent than, the sense of touch belonging to the body. </p>

<p align="center"><b>Latin(1748-1756) 1883</b>
</p><b>1883.</b>
Quod primum attinet, nempe 'abduci a corpore,' ita se habet: homo reducitur in statum quendam qui medius est inter somnum et vigiliam in quo statu cum est, non aliter scire potest quam quod prorsus 
vigil sit, omnes sensus tam vigiles sunt sicut in summa corporis vigilia, tam visus quam auditus, et quod mirabile, tactus, qui tunc exquisitior est quam usquam dari queat in vigilia corporis; in quo 
statu etiam visi sunt spiritus et angeli prorsus ad vivum etiam auditi, et quod mirum, tacti, et tunc fere nihil corporis intererat: tu status est de quo dicitur 'abduci a corpore,' et quod nesciant 'num 
in corpore vel extra corpus.'  In hunc statum modo ter aut quater immissus sum, ut modo scirem quomodo se habet, et quod spiritus et angeli omni sensu gaudeant, etiam tactu praepollente et exquisitiore 
tactu corporis. </p>
