<h3 align="center" class="ired">属天的奥秘 第1629节</h3>
<h4 align="center"></h4><p><strong>1629.</strong>善灵和天使灵的住所通常有门廊或长长的拱形入口大厅，有时是双拱形，还有供他们漫步的画廊。这些画廊的墙壁形状各式各样，并饰有鲜花和用鲜花奇妙编织的花环，以及许多其它装饰物。它们各不相同，彼此轮转，如前所述。有时他们在更明亮的光中看到这些事物，有时在不怎么明亮的光中看到它们，不过，却总伴随着内在快乐。随着灵人变得更完美，他们所居之地也会变成更美丽的地方。当它们发生变化时，一旁就会出现某种象窗户一样的东西。这时，该住所就会扩大，里面变得更暗，人们会看到仿佛某种天堂之物，带有星星，还有云。这表明他们的住所要变成更宜人的住所了。</p><br />

<p><strong>[NCE]1629.</strong> The houses of good spirits and angelic spirits usually have porticoes, or long entryways, vaulted and sometimes doubled, where they walk. The walls of the walkways are formed in many different ways and are graced with flowers and flower garlands woven in an extraordinary manner, not to mention other kinds of decoration that change and replace one another, as noted. These details appear to them in brighter light at one time, in weaker light at another, but always offering profound pleasure.<br />Their houses also turn more beautiful as the spirits grow in perfection. When the houses are undergoing change, something representing a window appears at the side and widens, and the inside grows darker. A piece of starry sky appears, as does a kind of cloud, which is a sign that their houses are changing into even more enchanting ones. </p>

The habitations of good spirits and of angelic spirits commonly have porticos or long entrance halls, arched, and sometimes doubled, where they walk. The walls of these are formed with much variety, 
and are also decorated with flowers and garlands of flowers wonderfully woven together, and with many other ornaments, that are varied and succeed one another, as before said; these they see, now in a 
clearer light, and now in one less clear, but always with inward delight. Their dwellings are also changed into more beautiful ones, as the spirits who inhabit them are perfected. When they are changed, 
there appears something representing a window, at one side; this is enlarged, and it becomes darker within; and there opens as it were something of heaven, with stars, also a kind of cloud; which 
is an indication that their dwellings are to be changed into dwellings still more pleasant. </p>

The dwellings of good spirits and of angelic spirits usually have porticoes or vaulted, sometimes double-vaulted, galleries where they can stroll. The walls of these porticoes are variously constructed. 
They are also decorated with flowers and with marvelously woven garlands of flowers, besides many other decorations which, as has been stated, change and replace one another. Sometimes they see them 
in brighter light, sometimes in dimmer, but always with interior delight. The places also where they reside change into more beautiful ones as spirits grow in perfection. When they are changing, something 
like a window appears on the side. This is then enlarged and greater obscurity develops inside, and one sees something of the sky so to speak with stars, and a kind of cloud. This is a sign that 
their dwelling-places are changing into more pleasant ones. </p>

</p><b>1629.</b>
Habitacula spirituum bonorum et spirituum angelicorum communiter habent porticus seu atria longa, arcuata, quandoque 'duplicata, ubi illorum ambulacra, quorum parietes formantur multa varietate; etiam 
decorantur per flores et florum serta mirabiliter contexta, praeter per plura ornamenta, quae variantur et succedunt, ut dictum; nunc visa illis in clariore luce, nunc in minore, semper cum delectatione 
interiore: domicilia eorum quoque mutantur in pulchriora, sicut spiritus perficiuntur; cum mutantur, apparet quoddam fenestram repraesentans a latere quod dilatatur, fitque obscurius intus, et patet 
aliquid quasi caeli cum stellis, et quaedam nubes, quod indicium est quod habitacula eorum mutentur in amoeniora. </p>
