<h4 align="center"></h4><p><strong>3489.</strong>教会的这种境况并未显明给那些教会中人，也就是说，他们蔑视并憎恶关乎良善与真理的一切事物，而且对这些事物，尤其对主自己心怀敌意。诚然，他们经常参加礼拜，怀着某种敬虔在那里聆听布道，领受圣餐，并且有时彼此像模像样地讨论这些事。这些事不光好人能做，坏人照样能做，他们甚至能向彼此示以常见的仁爱或友情。因此，别人在他们身上看不出他们对信之良善与真理，或对主有任何蔑视，更看不出任何憎恶，不用说对它们的任何敌意了。然而，这些行为都是外在形式，一个人能利用这些外在形式迷惑另一个人；而教会成员所具有的内在形式则完全不同，并且与这些外在形式完全相反。此处所描述并且具有这种性质的，正是内在形式。这些内在形式的本质活生生地呈现在天堂，因为天使只注意内在事物，也就是着眼于目的，或动机和意图，以及由此而来的思维。<br />从进入来世的基督教成员（关于他们，可参看<a href="2121.htm">2121</a>-<a href="2126.htm">2126</a>节）可以清楚看出，这些内在事物与外在事物何等不同。事实上，在来世，人们唯独根据内在事物思考和言谈，因为外在事物连同肉体都被抛弃了。在那里会明显看到，这种人无论在世时看似多么平和，他们仍旧彼此仇恨，并且仇恨属于信的一切事物，尤其仇恨主；因为在来世，当着他们的面一提及主的名，一种不仅蔑视祂，而且还憎恶并仇恨祂的气场明显从他们身上发出并弥漫开来，甚至包括那些表面上谈论并虔诚宣扬祂的人。当提及仁与信时也一样。<br />就那里所显现出来的内在形式而言，这些人具有这样的秉性：倘若在世时就释放并解除他们的外在约束，也就是说，倘若在世时他们就不害怕丧失生命，不畏惧法律，尤其不害怕为了他们孜孜以求的地位，以及渴望并热切追求的财富而名声扫地，他们就会怀着致命的仇恨、顺着自己的意图和思维而彼此陷害。他们会毫无良心地攫取他人财物，还会毫无良心地屠杀他们，无论受害者有多么无辜。这就是除了少数不知道的人外，当今基督徒的内在本性。由此明显可知何为本质上的教会性质。</p>

That the church is of such a character does not appear to those who are within the church; namely, that they despise and hold in aversion all things which are of good and truth; also that they bear enmities 
against such things, and especially against the Lord Himself; for they frequent places of worship, hear preaching, and are in a kind of sanctity when there; they go to the Holy Supper, and at 
times converse with one another in a becoming manner concerning such things-this is done by bad men as well as by good men-and they also live among themselves in civic charity or friendship. Consequently 
in the eyes of men no contempt appears, still less aversion; and less still enmity against the goods and truths of faith, and thus against the Lord. These things however are external forms by which 
one person misleads another; while the internal forms of the men of the church are altogether unlike, being quite contrary to the external forms. The internal forms are those which are here described, 
and which are as above mentioned; their real quality appears to the life in the heavens, for the angels do not attend to any other than internal things, that is, to ends, or to intentions and desires, 
and to the derivative thoughts. [2] How unlike these are to the externals is evident from those who come from the Christian world into the other life, concerning whom see above (n. 2121-2126); for 
in the other life they think and speak according to their internals alone; for externals are left behind together with the body; and there it is manifest that however peaceable such have seemed in the 
world, they nevertheless entertained hatred one against another, and against all things which are of faith, and especially against the Lord; for when in the other life the Lord is merely mentioned 
in their presence, a sphere not only of contempt but also of aversion and enmity against Him is manifestly exhaled and diffused from them, even from those who in appearance had spoken and preached piously 
about Him; and it is the same when charity and faith are mentioned. [3] In the internal form (which is there manifested) they are of such a character that if while they had lived in this world their 
externals had been loosed and removed, that is, had they not then feared for their life and had they not feared the laws, and especially had they not feared for their reputation, on account of the 
honors which they solicited and pursued, and on account of the wealth which they desired and eagerly sought, they would have rushed one against another with intestine hatred, in accordance with their 
impulses and thoughts; and would have seized the goods of others without any conscience, and likewise without any conscience would have butchered others, most especially the innocent. Such as regards 
their interiors are Christians at this day [A.D. 1751], except a few whom they do not know; from which it is evident what is the quality of the church.       </p>
<p>     GENESIS 27 </p>
<p>     1. And it came 
to pass that Isaac was old, and his eyes were dim that he could not see, and he called Esau his elder son, and said unto him, My son; and he said unto him, Behold me.      2. And he said, Behold I 
pray I am old, I know not the day of my death.      3. And now take I pray thy weapons, thy quiver, and thy bow, and go out to the field, and hunt me a hunting.      4. And make me dainties, such as 
I have loved, and bring to me, and I will eat, that my soul may bless thee before I die.      5. And Rebekah heard when Isaac spoke to Esau his son; and Esau went to the field to hunt for a hunting, 
to bring it.      6. And Rebekah said unto Jacob her son, saying, Behold I heard thy father speak unto Esau thy brother, saying,       7. Bring me a hunting, and make me dainties, and I will eat, 
and will bless thee before Jehovah before my death.      8. And now my son hearken unto my voice, according to that which I command thee.      9. Go now to the flock, and take me from thence two good 
kids of the she-goats, and I will make them dainties for thy father, such as he loveth.      10. And thou shalt bring to thy father, and he shall eat, that he may bless thee before his death.     
 11. And Jacob said to Rebekah his mother, Behold Esau my brother is a hairy man, and I am a smooth man.      12. Peradventure my father will feel me, and I shall be in his eyes as a misleader; and I 
shall bring upon myself a curse and not a blessing.      13. And his mother said unto him, Upon me be thy curse my son; only hearken to my voice, and go, take for me.      14. And he went, and took, 
and brought to his mother; and his mother made dainties, such as his father loved.      15. And Rebekah took garments of desires of Esau her elder son that were with her in the house, and put them 
upon Jacob her younger son.      16. And the skins of the kids of the she-goats she caused to be put upon his hands, and upon the smooth of his neck.      17. And she gave the dainties, and the bread, 
which she had made, into the hand of Jacob her son.      18. And he came unto his father and said, My father; and he said, Behold me, who art thou my son?      19. And Jacob said unto his father, 
I am Esau thy firstborn; I have done according as thou spokest unto me; arise I pray thee, sit, and eat of my hunting, that thy soul may bless me.      20. And Isaac said unto his son, How is it that 
thou hast hastened to find it, my son? And he said, Because Jehovah thy God made it come to meet my face.      21. And Isaac said unto Jacob, Come near I pray, and I will feel thee my son, whether 
thou be my very son Esau, or not.      22. And Jacob came near to Isaac his father, and he felt him, and said, The voice is Jacob's voice, but the hands are the hands of Esau.      23. And he recognized 
him not, because his hands were hairy like his brother Esau's hands; and he blessed him.      24. And he said, Art thou my very son Esau? And he said, I am.      25. And he said, Bring it near 
to me, and I will eat of my son's hunting, that my soul may bless thee; and he brought it near to him, and he did eat, and he brought him wine, and he drank.      26. And Isaac his father said unto him, 
Come near I pray, and kiss me, my son.      27. And he came near, and kissed him, and he smelled the smell of his garments, and blessed him, and said, See, the smell of my son is as the smell of 
a field which Jehovah hath blessed.      28. And God shall give thee of the dew of heaven, and of the fat things of the earth, and a multitude of corn and new wine.      29. Peoples shall serve thee, 
and peoples shall bow down themselves to thee. Be thou a master to thy brethren, and let thy mother's sons bow down themselves to thee; cursed are they that curse thee, and blessed are they that bless 
thee.      30. And it came to pass as Isaac made an end of blessing Jacob, and Jacob was scarcely yet gone out from the faces of Isaac his father, that Esau his brother came from his hunting.    
  31. And he also made dainties, and brought unto his father, and he said unto his father, Let my father arise and eat of his son's hunting, that thy soul may bless me.      32. And Isaac his father 
said unto him, Who art thou? And he said, I am thy son, thy firstborn, Esau.      33. And Isaac shuddered with exceeding great shuddering, and said, Who then is he that hath hunted hunting, and brought 
it to me, and I have eaten of all before thou camest, and blessed him? Yea, and he shall be blessed.      34. When Esau heard the words of his father, he cried with an exceeding great and bitter cry, 
and said unto his father, Bless me, me also, O my father.      35. And he said, Thy brother came with fraud, and hath taken away thy blessing.      36. And he said, Is it not that his name is called 
Jacob? And he hath supplanted me these two times; he hath taken away my birthright, and behold now he hath taken away my blessing. And he said, Hast thou not reserved a blessing for me?      37. 
And Isaac answered and said unto Esau, Behold I have made him thy master, and all his brethren have I given to him for servants; and with corn and new vine have I sustained him; and what then shall I 
do for thee, my son?      38. And Esau said unto his father, Hast thou but this one blessing, my father? Bless me, me also, O my father. And Esau lifted up his voice, and wept.      39. And Isaac his 
father answered and said unto him, Behold of the fat things of the earth shall be thy dwelling, and of the dew of heaven from above.      40. And upon thy sword shalt thou live, and shalt serve thy 
brother, and it shall come to pass when thou shalt have the dominion that thou shalt break his yoke from upon thy neck.      41. And Esau hated Jacob because of the blessing wherewith his father blessed 
him; and Esau said in his heart, The days of mourning for my father draw near, and I will kill Jacob my brother.      42. And the words of Esau her elder son were told to Rebekah; and she sent 
and called unto Jacob her younger son, and said unto him, Behold Esau thy brother comforteth himself concerning thee to kill thee.      43. And now, my son, hearken unto my voice, and arise, flee thou 
to Laban my brother to Haran.      44. And tarry with him some days until thy brother's wrath turn away; </p>
<p>     45. Until thy brother's anger turn away from thee, and he forget that which thou hast 
done to him, and I will send and take thee from thence; why should I be bereaved even of you both in one day?      46. And Rebekah said to Isaac, I loathe my life because of the daughters of Heth; if 
Jacob should take a woman of the daughters of Heth, such as these, of the daughters of the land, wherefore have I lives? </p>

To those within the Church it is not apparent that this is the condition of the Church, that is to say, that they treat with contempt and loathe everything to do with goodness and truth, and also show 
hostility towards those things, especially towards the Lord Himself. They do indeed attend places of worship, listen to sermons with some kind of reverence while they are there, go to the Holy Supper, 
and sometimes discuss those things with one another in a seemly way. The evil accordingly do the same things as the good, even exercising common charity or friendship to one another, and as a consequence 
others do not see in them any contempt for the goods and truths of faith, or therefore any contempt for the Lord, still less any loathing of these, and least of all any hostility towards them. 
But those very actions are outward forms, by which one person leads another astray, whereas the inward forms existing with members of the Church are completely different and the complete reverse of those 
outward forms. It is the inward forms which are described here and which are of that nature. The essential nature of these inward forms is presented visually in heaven; for the angels pay no attention 
to anything else than the things that are internal - to ends in view, that is, to people's intentions and wills, and to their thoughts stemming from these. How different these are from external things 
becomes clear from members of the Christian world entering the next life, regarding whom see <a href="2121.htm">2121</a>-<a href="2126.htm">2126</a>. </p>

 Indeed in the next life it is solely in accordance with internal things that people 
think and speak, for external things have been left behind with the body. There it is evident that however peaceable such people seemed to be in the world they nevertheless hated one another, and hated 
everything belonging to faith, hating the Lord above all else; for at the mere mention of the Lord's name in their presence in the next life a sphere not only of contempt but also of loathing and hostility 
towards Him clearly emanates from them and envelops them, including those who to outward appearances spoke about Him with reverence and also preached about Him. It is similar when charity and 
faith are mentioned. As to their inward form which is disclosed there, these people are such as they would have been while living in the world if external restraints had been released and taken away 
from them. That is, if they had not in the world feared for their lives and feared the law, and in particular if they had not feared for their reputation on account of the positions they strove and worked 
for, and of the wealth they desired and avidly sought after, they would on account of their deadly hatred have laid into one another, as their intentions and thought directed them. And without any 
conscience they would have seized other people's goods and also without any conscience would have butchered them, no matter how utterly innocent their victims may have been. Such is the nature of Christians 
interiorly at the present day, apart from a few who remain unknown. From all this it is evident what the nature of the Church is essentially. </p>

<p><LI value='21'> And Isaac said to Jacob, Come near now, and I will feel you, my son, whether you are my son Esau, or not. </p>
<p><LI value='22'> And Jacob came near to Isaac his father; and he felt him,

 Et adducas patri tuo, et edat, propterea ut benedicat tibi ante mortem suam. 11.  Et dixit Jacob ad Rebeccam matrem suam Ecce Esau frater meus vir pilosus, et ego vir levis. 12.  Fortassis 
palpaverit me pater meus, et ero in oculis ejus sicut seducens, et adducam super me maledictionem et non benedictionem. 13.  Et dixit illi mater ejus, Super me maledictio tui, fili mi, tantummodo ausculta 
voci meae, et vade, accipe mihi. 14.  Et ivit, et accepit, et adduxit matri suae, et fecit mater illius cupedias, quemadmodum amavit pater illius. 15.  Et accepit Rebecca vestes Esavi filii 
sui majoris desideriorum, quae cum illa in domo, et induit Jacobum filium suum minorem. 16.  Et pelles haedorum caprarum indui fecit super manus illius, et super levitatem collorum illius. 17.  Et dedit 
cupedias, et panem, quae fecit, in manum Jacobi filii sui. 18.  Et venit ad patrem suum, et dixit, Pater mi; et dixit, Ecce me, quis tu fili mi? 19.  Et dixit Jacob ad patrem suum, Ego Esau primogenitus 
tuus, feci quemadmodum locutus es ad me, surge quaeso, sede, et ede e venatione mea, propterea ut benedicat mihi anima tua. 20.  Et dixit Jishak ad filium suum, Quid hoc festinasti invenire, 
fili mi? et dixit, Quia obvenire fecit JEHOVAH DEUS tuus ad faciem meam. 21.  Et dixit Jishak ad Jacobum, Accede quaeso, et palpabo te, fili mi, an tu is filius meus Esau, si non. 22.  Et accessit 
Jacob ad Jishakum patrem suum, et palpavit illum, et dixit, Vox vox Jacobi, et manus manus Esavi. 23.  Et non agnovit illum, quia erant manus ejus sicut manus Esavi fratris ejus pilosae; et benedixit 
illi, 24.  Et dixit, Tu is filius meus Esau? et dixit, Ego. 25.  Et dixit, Adfer mihi, et edam e venatione filii mei, ideo ut benedicat tibi anima mea; et attulit illi, et edit, et adduxit illi vinum, 
et bibit. 26.  Et dixit ad illum Jishak pater illius, Accede quaeso, et osculare me, illi mi. 27.  Et accessit, et osculatus est illum, et odoratus est odorem vestium illius, et benedixit illi, 
et dixit, Vide, odor filii mei sicut odor agri, cui benedixit JEHOVAH. 28.  Et dabit tibi DEUS de rore caeli, et de pinguedinibus terrae, et multitudinem frumenti et musti. 29.  Servient tibi populi, 
et incurvabunt se tibi populi, esto herus fratribus tuis, et incurvabunt se tibi filii matris tuae; maledicentes tibi maledictus, et benedicentes tibi benedictus. 30.  Et fuit, quemadmodum absolvit 
Jishak benedicere Jacobo, et fuit tantum exeundo exivit Jacob ex faciebus Jishaki patris sua, et Esau frater ejus venit e venatione sua. 31.  Et fecit etiam is cupedias, et adduxit patri suo, et dixit 
patri suo, Surgat pater meus, et edat e venatione filii sui, propterea ut benedicat mihi anima tua. 32.  Et dixit ei Jishak pater ejus, Quis tu? et dixit, Ego filius tuus, primogenitus tuus Esau. 33. 
 Et horruit Jishak horrore magno usque valde, et dixit, Quis igitur ille qui venatus venationem, et adduxit mihi, et edi ab omni antequam venisti, et benedixi ei? etiam benedictus erit. 34. Ut 
audivit Esau verba patris sui, et exclamavit exclamatione magna et amara usque valde; et dixit patri suo, Benedic mihi etiam ego pater mi. 35.  Et dixit, Venit frater tuus in fraude, et sumpsit benedictionem 
tuam. 36.  Et dixit, Num quod vocat nomen illius Jacob? et supplantavit me is duabus vicibus; primogenituram meam sumpsit, et ecce nunc sumpsit benedictionem meam; et dixit, Annon reservasti 
mihi benedictionem? 37.  Et respondit Jishak, et dixit Esavo, Ecce herum posui illum tibi, et omnes fratres ejus dedi ei ad servos, et frumento et musto fulcivi eum, et tibi igitur quid faciam fili 
mi? 38.  Et dixit Esau ad patrem suum, An benedictio una haec tibi, pater mi? benedic mihi etiam ego pater mi; et sustulit Esau vocem suam, et flevit. 39.  Et respondit Jishak pater ejus, et dixit 
ad eum, Ecce de pinguedinibus terrae erit habitatio tua, et de rore caeli desuper. 40.  Et super gladio tuo vives, et fratri tuo servies, et erit quando dominaris, et disrumpes jugum illius desuper collo 
tuo. 41.  Et odit Esau Jacobum propter benedictionem, qua benedixit illi pater illius; et dixit Esau in corde suo, Appropinquabunt dies luctus patris mei, et occidam Jacobum fratrem meum. 42.  
Et indicatum Rebeccae verba Esavi filii sui majoris, et misit, et vocavit ad Jacobum filium suum minorem, et dixit ad illum, Ecce Esau frater tuus consolans se tibi ad occidendum te. 43.  Et nunc fili 
mi, ausculta voci meae, et surge, fuge tibi ad Laban fratrem meum Haranem. 44.  Et commoreris cum eo diebus aliquibus, donec recedit excandescentia fratris tui. 45.  Usque recedat ira fratris tui 
a te, et obliviscatur ejus quod fecisti illi, et mittam et accipiam te exinde; quare orbabor etiam ambobus vobis die uno? 46.  Et dixit Rebecca ad Jishakum, Fastidio vitam meam pro filiabus Heth, si 
accipit Jacob mulierem e filiabus Heth, sicut illae e filiabus terrae, quare mihi vitae? </p>
