<h3 align="center" class="ired">属天的奥秘 第3836节</h3>
<h4 align="center"></h4><p><strong>3836.</strong>创世记29:25，26.到了早晨，看哪，这是利亚，雅各对拉班说，你向我作的是什么事呢？我服事你，不是为拉结吗？你为什么欺哄我呢？拉班说，在头生的之前把小的送出去，我们这地方没有这样行的。<br />“到了早晨”表在这种状态下的启示。“看哪，这是利亚”表这是与外在真理的结合。“雅各对拉班说，你向我作的是什么事呢”表愤慨。“我服事你，不是为拉结吗”表这种勤奋努力是为内在真理情感而做的。“你为什么欺哄我呢”表更大的愤慨。“拉班说，我们这地方没有这样行的”表这种状态不是这样。“在头生的之前把小的送出去”表对内层真理的情感要先于对外在真理的情感。</p>

Verses 25, 26. And it came to pass in the morning that behold it was Leah; and he said unto Laban, What is this that thou hast done unto me? Did not I serve with thee for Rachel? And why hast thou defrauded 
me? And Laban said, It is not so done in our place, to give the younger before the firstborn. "And it came to pass in the morning," signifies enlightenment in that state; "that behold it was Leah," 
signifies that there was conjunction with external truth; "and he said unto Laban, What is this that thou hast done unto me?" signifies indignation; "did not I serve with thee for Rachel?" signifies 
that there had been study for the affection of internal truth; "and why hast thou defrauded me?" signifies greater indignation; "and Laban said, It is not so done in our place," signifies that the 
state is not such; "to give the younger before the firstborn," signifies that the affection of interior truth should precede the affection of external truth. </p>

Verses 25, 26 And so it was in the morning, that behold it was Leah. And he said to Laban, What is this you have done to me? Was it not for Rachel that I served with you? And why have you cheated me? 
And Laban said, It is not done that way in our place, to give the younger before the firstborn. </p>
<p>'So it was in the morning' means enlightenment in that state. 'That behold it was Leah' means that it 
was a joining to external truth. 'And he said to Laban, What is this you have done to me?' means indignation. 'Was it not for Rachel that I served with you?' means that it was a diligent effort made 
for the affection for internal truth. 'And why have you cheated me?' means greater indignation. 'And Laban said, It is not done that way in our place' means that the state is not such...... 'To give 
the younger before the firstborn' means, that the affection for interior truth should precede the affection for external truth. </p>

Vers. 25, 26.  Et fuit in mane, et ecce illa Leah, et dixit ad Laban, Quid hoc fecisti mihi? nonne pro Rachele servivi cum te? et quare fraudasti me? Et dixit Laban, Non fit ita in loco nostro, dare 
minorem ante primogenitam.  `Fuit in mane' significat illustrationem in illo statu:  `et ecce illa Leah' significat quod conjunctio cum vero externo:  `et dixit ad Laban, Quid hoc fecisti mihi?' 
significat indignationem:  `nonne pro Rachele servivi cum te?' significat quod studium esset pro affectione veri interni:  `et quare fraudasti me?' significat indignationem majorem:  `et dixit Laban, 
Non fit ita in loco nostro' significat quod non talis sit status:  `dare minorem ante primogenitam' significat ut affectio veri interioris praecedat affectioni veri externi.   </p>
