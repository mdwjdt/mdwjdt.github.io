<h3 align="center" class="ired">属天的奥秘 第1453节</h3>
<h4 align="center"></h4><p><strong>1453.</strong>至于“西边是伯特利，东边是艾”表祂的状态依然是朦胧的，也就是说，对属天、属灵事物的认知是朦胧的；因为被属天事物所主导是一回事，被对属天事物的认知所主导又是另一回事。比起成人，婴幼儿和小孩子更是被属天事物所主导，因为他们具有对父母的爱，并且彼此相爱，处在纯真中；而比起婴幼儿和小孩子，成人更是被对属天事物的认知所主导，因为很多成人根本不在爱的属天事物中。人在爱与信的事上接受指教之前，就认知而言，处于一种朦胧的状态。这种状态在此被描述为“西边是伯特利”（即“海边”），“东边是艾”。如前所述，“伯特利”表对属天事物的认知，但“艾”表对世俗事物的认知。当属天事物处于朦胧状态时，前者被说成是“西边”；而当它们处于明亮状态时，后者被说成是“东边”；因为与西边相比，东边是明亮。无需证实西边和东边有这样的含义，因为它们不言而喻。<br />然而，“伯特利”表对属天事物的认知，这从圣言中提及伯特利的其它经文清楚可知，如下一章：<br />他从南地渐渐往伯特利去，到了伯特利和艾的中间，就是从前支搭帐棚的地方，也是他起先筑坛的地方。（创世记<a href="http://39-27.cn/创13.3.htm">13:3</a>，<a href="http://39-27.cn/创13.4.htm">4</a>）<br />此处“从南地渐渐往伯特利去”表逐渐进入认知的光明中，这就是为何这种情况下没有提及“西边是伯特利，东边是艾”。当雅各看到天梯时，他说：<br />这不是别的，乃是神的殿，也是天的门。他就给那地方起名叫伯特利（就是“神殿”的意思）。（创世记<a href="http://39-27.cn/创28.17.htm">28:17</a>，<a href="http://39-27.cn/创28.19.htm">19</a>）<br />此处，“伯特利”同样表对属天事物的认知，因为当一个人被呈现为认知的属天事物所主导时，他就是一个“伯特利”，即一个“神殿”，一扇“天门”。人在重生期间，藉着对属灵、属天事物的认知被教导；不过，一旦重生，教导就完成，他就被呈现为认知的属天、属灵事物所主导。后来：<br />神对雅各说，起来！上伯特利去，住在那里，要在那里筑一座坛给向你显现的神。（创世记<a href="http://39-27.cn/创35.1.htm">35:1</a>，<a href="http://39-27.cn/创35.6.htm">6</a>-<a href="http://39-27.cn/创35.7.htm">7</a>）<br />同样，“伯特利”在此表认知。当着伯特利的耶和华约柜的面，并以色列人为求问耶和华而造访那地（士师记<a href="http://39-27.cn/士20.18.htm">20:18</a>，<a href="http://39-27.cn/士20.26.htm">26</a>，<a href="http://39-27.cn/士20.27.htm">27</a>；撒母耳记上<a href="http://39-27.cn/撒上7.16.htm">7:16</a>，<a href="http://39-27.cn/撒上10.3.htm">10:3</a>）都有同样的含义；还有，亚述王吩咐从撒玛利亚所掳来的祭司回去一个，使他住在那里，指教他们怎样敬畏耶和华（列王记下<a href="http://39-27.cn/王下17.27.htm">17:27</a>，<a href="http://39-27.cn/王下17.28.htm">28</a>）。阿摩司书：<br />亚玛谢又对阿摩司说，你这先见哪，要逃往犹大地去，在那里糊口，在那里说预言，却不要在伯特利再说预言，因为这里有王的圣所，有王的宫殿。（阿摩司书<a href="http://39-27.cn/摩7.12.htm">7:12</a>-<a href="http://39-27.cn/摩7.13.htm">13</a>）<br />耶罗波安亵渎伯特利后（列王记上<a href="http://39-27.cn/王上12.32.htm">12:32</a>；<a href="http://39-27.cn/王上13.1.htm">13:1</a>-<a href="http://39-27.cn/王上13.8.htm">8</a>；列王记下<a href="http://39-27.cn/王下23.15.htm">23:15</a>），伯特利就成了反面代表（参看何西阿书<a href="http://39-27.cn/何10.15.htm">10:15</a>；阿摩司书<a href="http://39-27.cn/摩3.14.htm">3:14</a>-<a href="http://39-27.cn/摩3.15.htm">15</a>；<a href="http://39-27.cn/摩5.5.htm">5:5</a>-<a href="http://39-27.cn/摩5.7.htm">7</a>）。至于“艾”表对世俗事物的认知，这也可从圣言的历史和预言部分得以证实（参看约书亚记<a href="http://39-27.cn/书7.2.htm">7:2</a>；<a href="http://39-27.cn/书8.1.htm">8:1</a>-<a href="http://39-27.cn/书8.28.htm">28</a>；耶利米书<a href="http://39-27.cn/耶49.3.htm">49:3</a>-<a href="http://39-27.cn/耶49.4.htm">4</a>）。</p><br />

<p><strong>[NCE]1453.</strong> Bethel was toward the sea and Ai toward the east means that his state would still be confused, specifically in respect to the knowledge of heavenly and spiritual affairs. It is one thing to acquire heavenly qualities and another to acquire knowledge of them. Children and young people are more immersed in heavenly matters than adults are, because they have love for their parents, love shared with peers, and innocence. Adults, on the other hand, are more caught up in knowledge about these things than children and young people are, even though most of them do not display heavenly kinds of love.<br />Until we learn about the properties of love and faith, we live in dim conditions, so far as knowledge goes. Such conditions are portrayed here by the fact that Bethel was toward the sea (the west) and Ai toward the east. Bethel, as noted [搂<a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_1453/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_1451" target=_top>1451</a>], symbolizes the knowledge of heavenly matters. Ai, though, symbolizes the knowledge of worldly matters. When the former knowledge is dim, it is said to be on the west, because in the Word, the west symbolizes obscurity. When the latter knowledge is clear, it is said to be on the east, because the east is brighter than the west.{*1} There is no need to prove this symbolism of west and east, since anyone can see it without proof.<br />[2] The symbolism of Bethel as the knowledge of heavenly things can be seen from other passages in the Word that mention Bethel. In the next chapter, <a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_1453/bible_king-james-version_genesis_13_1-18" target=_top>Genesis 13</a>, for example:<br />Abram went on his journeys from the south all the way to Bethel, all the way to the place where his tent had been at the start, between Bethel and Ai, to the place of the altar that he had made there. (<a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_1453/bible_king-james-version_genesis_13_3-4" target=_top>Genesis 13:3-4</a>)<br />"On his journeys from the south to Bethel" in this passage symbolizes an advance into the light of knowledge, which is why it does not say here that Bethel was on the west and Ai on the east. As regards Jacob, when he saw the ladder:{*2} He said, "This is nothing but the house of God, and this the gate of heaven." And he called the name of this place Bethel. (<a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_1453/bible_king-james-version_genesis_28_17" target=_top>Genesis 28:17</a>, <a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_1453/bible_king-james-version_genesis_28_19" target=_top>19</a>)<br />Here too Bethel symbolizes a knowledge of heavenly things. We ourselves are "Bethel" 钬?which means "God's house" 钬?and the "gate of heaven" when we achieve the heavenly qualities we have learned about. While we are being reborn, the knowledge of spiritual and heavenly qualities initiates us into the process; but when our rebirth is complete, our initiation is complete, and the spiritual and heavenly attributes we have learned about become ours. Later on:<br />God said to Jacob, "Rise; go up to Bethel and live there. Make there an altar to God, who appeared to you." (<a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_1453/bible_king-james-version_genesis_35_1" target=_top>Genesis 35:1</a>, <a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_1453/bible_king-james-version_genesis_35_6-7" target=_top>6-7</a>)<br />Here again Bethel symbolizes knowledge.<br />[3] The ark of Jehovah was in Bethel, and the children of Israel would go there and ask Jehovah questions (<a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_1453/bible_king-james-version_judges_20_18" target=_top>Judges 20:18</a>, <a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_1453/bible_king-james-version_judges_20_26-27" target=_top>26-27</a>; <a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_1453/bible_king-james-version_1-samuel_7_16" target=_top>1 Samuel 7:16</a>; <a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_1453/bible_king-james-version_1-samuel_10_3" target=_top>10:3</a>), which has a similar symbolism. So does the fact that the king of Assyria sent [to Samaria] one of the priests he had carried off from Samaria, and that this priest settled in Bethel and was teaching them how to fear Jehovah (<a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_1453/bible_king-james-version_2-kings_17_27-28" target=_top>2 Kings 17:27-28</a>). In Amos:<br />Amaziah said to Amos, "Seer, go, flee into the land of Judah and eat bread there, and there you are to prophesy. And at Bethel you must not continue to prophesy any more, because it is a royal sanctuary, and it is a house for the kingdom."{*3} (<a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_1453/bible_king-james-version_amos_7_12-13" target=_top>Amos 7:12-13</a>)<br />[4] After Jeroboam desecrated Bethel (<a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_1453/bible_king-james-version_1-kings_12_32" target=_top>1 Kings 12:32</a>; <a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_1453/bible_king-james-version_1-kings_13_1-8" target=_top>13:1-8</a>; <a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_1453/bible_king-james-version_2-kings_23_15" target=_top>2 Kings 23:15</a>), it took on the opposite representation. Examples may be seen in <a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_1453/bible_king-james-version_hosea_10_15" target=_top>Hosea 10:15</a>; <a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_1453/bible_king-james-version_amos_3_14-15" target=_top>Amos 3:14-15</a>; <a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_1453/bible_king-james-version_amos_5_5" target=_top>5:5</a>, <a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_1453/bible_king-james-version_amos_5_6" target=_top>6</a>, <a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_1453/bible_king-james-version_amos_5_7" target=_top>7</a>.<br />The symbolism of Ai as the knowledge of worldly things can also be proved by narrative and prophetic passages in the Word 钬?in <a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_1453/bible_king-james-version_joshua_7_2" target=_top>Joshua 7:2</a>; <a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_1453/bible_king-james-version_joshua_8_1-28" target=_top>8:1-28</a>; <a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_1453/bible_king-james-version_jeremiah_49_3-4" target=_top>Jeremiah 49:3-4</a>.<br /><br /><strong>Footnotes:</strong><br />{*1} Swedenborg asserts elsewhere that in the spiritual world the cardinal directions function differently than in the physical world. There the east is defined as the direction in which the Lord is perceived as a sun (<a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_1453/swedenborg_heaven-and-hell-dole_141" target=_top>Heaven and Hell 141</a>; <a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_1453/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_5097" target=_top>Secrets of Heaven 5097</a>, <a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_1453/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_9668#subsection-2-2" target=_top>9668:2</a>); this implies that the east in the spiritual world is always brighter than the west, because the sun in that world is always in the east and never in the west. It is to that spiritual context rather than to a physical context (in which the east and west are relatively bright or dark depending on the time of day) that the present passage appears to refer. [JSR]<br />{*2} <a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_1453/bible_king-james-version_genesis_28_12-15" target=_top>Genesis 28:12-15</a> describes a dream of Jacob's, in which he saw a ladder with Jehovah at the top and angels going up and down. [LHC]<br />{*3} The word "house" here means a temple, and the phrase "a house for the kingdom" therefore refers to a religious center for the nation. When the northern kingdom (Israel) split from the southern kingdom (Judah), Jeroboam, king in the north, set up golden calves at Dan and Bethel as places of sacrifice to counteract the drawing power of Jerusalem, located in Judah (see <a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_1453/bible_king-james-version_1-kings_12_1-33" target=_top>1 Kings 12</a>).

Having Bethel toward the sea, and Ai on the East, signifies that the Lord's state was still obscure, that is to say, in regard to the knowledges of celestial and spiritual things; for it is one thing 
to be in celestial things, and another to be in the knowledges of celestial things. Infants and children are in celestial things more than adults, because they are in love toward their parents, and in 
mutual love, and also in innocence; but adults are in the knowledges of celestial things more than infants and children, while very many of them are not in the celestial things of love. Before man is 
instructed in the things of love and faith, he is in an obscure state, that is, in regard to knowledges; which state is here described by having Bethel toward the sea, that is on the west, and Ai on 
the east. By "Bethel," as has been said, is signified the knowledges of celestial things; but by "Ai" the knowledges of worldly things. The knowledges of celestial things are said to be "on the west" 
when they are in obscurity, for in the Word "the west" signifies what is obscure; and the knowledges of worldly things are said to be "on the east" when they are in clearness, for relatively to the west, 
the east is clearness. That the west and the east have this signification needs no confirmation, for it is evident to everyone without confirmation.  [2] And that "Bethel" signifies the knowledges 
of celestial things, may be seen from other passages in the Word where Bethel is named; as in the next chapter, where it is said that      Abram went on his journeys from the south even to Bethel, 
unto the place where his tent was in the beginning, between Bethel and Ai, unto the place of the altar which he made there (Gen. 13:3-4); </p>
<p>where "on his journeys from the south to Bethel," signifies 
progression into the light of knowledges, on which account it is not here said that Bethel was on the west and Ai on the east. When Jacob saw the ladder, he said: </p>
<p>     This is none other but the House 
of God, and this is the gate of heaven; and he called the name of that place Bethel (Gen. 28:17, 19); </p>
<p>where the knowledge of celestial things is in like manner signified by "Bethel;" for man is a Bethel, 
that is a House of God, and also a gate of heaven, when he is in the celestial things of knowledges. When a man is being regenerated, he is introduced by means of the knowledges of spiritual and 
celestial things; but when he has been regenerated, he has then been introduced, and is in the celestial and spiritual things of the knowledges. Afterwards: </p>
<p>     God said unto Jacob, Arise, go up to 
Bethel, and dwell there; make there an altar to God who appeared unto thee (Gen. 35:1, 6-7); </p>
<p>where in like manner "Bethel" signifies knowledges.  [3] That the ark of Jehovah was in Bethel, and that 
the sons of Israel came thither and inquired of Jehovah (Judges 20:18, 26, 27; 1 Sam. 7:16, 10:3) signify similar things; also that the king of Assyria sent one of the priests whom he had brought from 
Samaria, and he dwelt in Bethel, and taught them how they should fear Jehovah (2 Kings 17:27, 28). In Amos: </p>
<p>     Amaziah said unto Amos, O thou seer, go flee thee away into the land of Judah, and 
there eat bread, and there shalt thou prophesy; but prophesy not again any more at Bethel, for this is the king's sanctuary, and this is the house of the kingdom (Amos 7:12-13). [4] After Jeroboam had 
profaned Bethel (1 Kings 12:32; 13:1-8; 2 Kings 23:15) it had an opposite representation (see Hosea 10:15; Amos 3:14-15; 4:5-7). But that "Ai" signifies the knowledges of worldly things, may also be 
confirmed from the historical and the prophetical parts of the Word (see Josh. 7:2; 8:1-28; Jer. 49:3-4). </p>

<p align="center"><b>Elliott(1983-1999) 1453</b></p><p><b>1453.</b>
As regards 'Bethel being towards the sea and Ai towards the east,<A name="fntext1"></a><A href="#fn1"><sup>a</sup></a> meaning that His state was still obscure, that is to say, so far as cognitions of celestial and spiritual things were concerned, it 
is one thing to be governed by celestial things, another to be governed by the cognitions of celestial things. Infants and children are governed, more so than adults, by celestial things because of the 
presence in them of love towards their parents and of love for one another, as well as of innocence. But adults are governed, more so than infants and children, by the cognitions of those celestial 
things, very many adults not being governed at all by the celestial things of love. Until a person is taught the things of love and faith, he dwells in an obscure state, that is, so far as cognitions 
are concerned. That state is described here by the statement 'Bethel' was 'towards the sea', that is, 'towards the west', and 'Ai towards the east' 'Bethel', as stated already, means cognitions of celestial 
things, but 'Ai' the cognitions of worldly things. The former are said to be 'towards the west' when they are in obscurity, for in the Word 'the west' means that which is obscure, while the latter 
are said to be 'towards the east' when they are in brightness; for in comparison with the west the east is brightness There is no need to confirm that west and east have these meanings, as they may 
be evident to anyone without confirmation. </p>
<p></p>
<p><b>[2]</b>
 That 'Bethel' means the cognitions of celestial things however may become clear from other places where Bethel is mentioned in the Word, as in the next 
chapter, </p>
<blockquote>
Abram went according to his journeys from the south even to Bethel, to the place where his tent had been at the start, between Bethel and Ai, to the place of the altar that he had made 
there. <a href="http://bible.gospelcom.net/cgi-bin/bible?passage=Gen%2013:3,%204&amp;version=ESV&amp;interface=print&amp;showfn=yes&amp;showxref">Gen 13:3, 4</a>. 
</blockquote>
<p>Here 'according to his journeys from the south towards Bethel' means advancing into the light of cognitions, and this is why no reference is made in this case to 'Bethel towards 
the west and Ai towards the east'. When Jacob saw the stairway he said, </p>
<blockquote>
This is none other than the house of God, and this is the gate of heaven. And he called the name of this place Bethel. <a href="http://bible.gospelcom.net/cgi-bin/bible?passage=Gen%2028:17,%2019&amp;version=ESV&amp;interface=print&amp;showfn=yes&amp;showxref">Gen 28:17, 19</a>. 
</blockquote>
<p>Here similarly 'Bethel' means knowledge of celestial things, for a person is a 'Bethel', that is, a 'House of God', and a 'Gate of heaven', when he is governed by the celestial things 
that have been present as cognitions. While a person is being regenerated he is undergoing introduction, which is effected by means of cognitions of spiritual and celestial things; but once he has been 
regenerated that introduction has been completed, and he is now governed by the celestial and spiritual things that have been present as cognitions. Further on it is said, </p>
<blockquote>
God said to Jacob, Arise, 
go up to Bethel, and dwell there; make there an altar to the God who appeared to you. <a href="http://bible.gospelcom.net/cgi-bin/bible?passage=Gen%2035:1,%206,%207&amp;version=ESV&amp;interface=print&amp;showfn=yes&amp;showxref">Gen 35:1, 6, 7</a>. 
</blockquote>
<p></p>
<p><b>[3]</b>
 Here similarly 'Bethel' means cognitions. </p>
<blockquote>
The presence of the Ark of Jehovah in Bethel, 
and the visits to that place by the children of Israel to inquire of Jehovah, <a href="http://bible.gospelcom.net/cgi-bin/bible?passage=Judg%2020:18,%2026,%2027&amp;version=ESV&amp;interface=print&amp;showfn=yes&amp;showxref">Judg 20:18, 26, 27</a>; <a href="http://bible.gospelcom.net/cgi-bin/bible?passage=Sam%207:16;%2010:3&amp;version=ESV&amp;interface=print&amp;showfn=yes&amp;showxref">Sam 7:16; 10:3</a>, have similar meanings. So also has the reference to the king of Assyria sending 
one of the priests whom he had deported from Samaria, who resided in Bethel and was teaching them how to fear Jehovah, <a href="2.htm">2</a> 
</blockquote>
Kings 17:27, <a href="28.htm">28</a>. In Amos, </p>
<p>Amaziah said to Amos, O seer, go, flee to the land 
of Judah, and eat bread there, and prophesy there. And do not prophesy any more in Bethel, for this is the king's sanctuary and this is a house of the kingdom. Amos 7:12, <a href="13.htm">13</a>. </p>
<p></p>
<p><b>[4]</b>
 After Jeroboam had 
profaned Bethel, <a href="1.htm">1</a> Kings 12:32; 13:1-8; <a href="2.htm">2</a> Kings 23:15, Bethel had a contrary representation, as in Hosea 10:15; Amos 3:14, <a href="15.htm">15</a>; 5:5-7. As regards 'Ai' meaning cognitions of worldly things however this 
too may be confirmed from historical and prophetical parts of the Word, in Josh. 7:2; 8:1-28; Jer. 49:3, <a href="4.htm">4</a>.

nam occidens significat in Verbo obscurum; hae dicuntur 'ab oriente' cum in claro, nam oriens respective ad occidentem est clarum; quod occidens et oriens illa significent, non opus est confirmare, quia 
cuivis absque confirmatione patet:  [2] quod autem 'Bethel' significet cognitiones caelestium, constare potest ab aliis locis ubi Bethel nominatur in Verbo, ut in cap. seq. xiii, Quod Abram iverit 
juxta itinera sua a meridie usque ad Bethelem, usque locum, ubi fuit tentorium illius in initio inter Bethel et inter Aiam, ad locum altaris, quod fecit ibi, vers. 3, 4; </p>
<p>ubi {1}'juxta itinera sua a 
meridie ad Bethelem' significat progressionem in lucem cognitionum, quare non ibi dicitur quod 'Bethel ab occidente, et (x)Ai ab oriente': de Jacobo ubi vidit scalam, Dixit, Non hoc nisi Domus Dei, 
et hoc porta caeli.... et vocavit nomen loci hujus Bethel, Gen. xxviii 17, 19; </p>
<p>ubi similiter per 'Bethel' significatur cognitio caelestium; est enim homo 'Bethel,' hoc est, Domus Dei, tum 'porta caeli,' 
cum in cognitionum caelestibus est; cum regeneratur homo, introducitur per cognitiones spiritualium et caelestium, at cum regeneratus est, tunc introductus est, et est in cognitionum caelestibus et 
spiritualibus:  postea, Dixit Deus ad Jacobum, Surge, ascende Bethelem, et habita ibi, fac ibi altare Deo, Qui apparuit tibi, Gen. xxxv 1, 6, 7; </p>
<p>[3] ubi similiter per 'Bethel' significantur cognitiones: 
 quod arca Jehovae in Bethele, et illuc venirent filii Israelis, et interrogarent Jehovam, Jud. xx 18, 26, 27; 1 Sam. vii 16; x 3, similia significant:  tum quod rex Assyriae miserit unum de sacerdotibus, 
quos transportavit e Samaria, qui consedit in Bethele, et fuit docens eos quomodo timerent Jehovam, 2 Reg. xvii 27, 28:  apud Amos, Dixit Amaziah ad Amos, Videns i, fuge tibi in terram Jehudae, 
et comede ibi panem, et ibi prophetes; et Bethele non addas amplius prophetare, quia sanctuarium Regis haec, et domus Regni haec, vii 12, 13. [4] Postquam profanavit Jeroboam Bethelem, 1 Reg. 
xii 32; xiii 1-8; 2 Reg. xxiii 15, per Bethelem repraesentabatur contrarium, ut Hos. x 15; Amos. iii 14, 15; (x)v 5-7.  Quod autem 'Ai' significet cognitiones mundanorum, confirmari quoque potest ab historicis 
et propheticis Verbi, apud Jos. vii 2; viii 1-28; Jer. xlix 3, 4. @1 So Sch., but in 1553 S. has secundum, perhaps ivit has been accidentally omitted here.$ </p>
