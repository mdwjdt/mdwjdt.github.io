<h3 align="center" class="ired">属天的奥秘 第1621节</h3>
<h4 align="center"></h4><p><strong>1621.</strong>蒙福的人周围的大气是光的属性，因为它们是光的产物，并且不计其数。其美丽和愉悦如此之大，以致无法描述。有些大气如钻石一般，其每个细微部分都发出灿烂的光辉，仿佛由钻石微粒构成。有些大气类似于一切闪闪发光的宝石。有些大气看似巨大的珍珠，光线自中心透射出来，闪耀着最亮丽的色彩。有些大气发出的火焰如同金、银，或钻石般的金、银。有些大气由五彩斑斓的鲜花构成，其形状极其细微，几不可察。这类大气以其无穷变化充满小孩子的天堂。事实上，那里显现的大气似乎含有小孩子玩耍的形像，只是太过细微，难以辩认，只能在心灵深处感知。小孩子从这些形像中获得这样的观念：他们周围的一切事物都是活的，并处于主的生命中。这种观念以快乐感染其至内在。此外还有其它大气，其种类数不胜数，难以形容。</p><br />

<p><strong>[NCE]1621.</strong> I start with the atmospheres that the blessed live in, which are made of light, because they rise out of the light there. The number of different kinds cannot be counted, and they are so beautiful and pleasant that they cannot be described. There are diamondlike atmospheres that flash in all their most minuscule elements, as if they were made of diamond pellets. There are atmospheres that resemble the gleam of all kinds of gems. There are atmospheres seemingly made of translucent pearls glowing from within, streaking the air with the most brilliant colors. There are atmospheres afire with gold, it seems, or with silver, or with diamondlike gold and silver. There are atmospheres composed of multicolored flowers so small they cannot be seen; countless variations on this type of atmosphere fill the heaven where small children live. In fact one even sees atmospheres composed of what seem to be children at play, again at a size that is too small to see but that can be perceived, although only by the deepest power of thought. This gives young children the idea that everything around them is alive and is part of the Lord's stream of life 钬?a thought that gladdens them to the core.<br />There are many other kinds of atmosphere besides, because the variations are beyond number and also beyond description. </p>

As regards the atmospheres in which the blessed live, which are of the light because from that light, they are numberless, and are of beauty and pleasantness so great that they cannot be described. There 
are diamond-like atmospheres, which glitter in all their least parts, as if they were composed of diamond spherules. There are atmospheres resembling the sparkling of all the precious stones. There 
are atmospheres as of great pearls translucent from their centers, and shining with the brightest colors. There are atmospheres that flame as from gold, also from silver, and also from diamond-like 
gold and silver. There are atmospheres of flowers of variegated hue that are in forms most minute and scarcely discernible; such, in endless variety, fill the heaven of infants. There are even atmospheres 
as of sporting infants, in forms most minute, indiscernible, and perceptible only to an inmost idea; from which the infants receive the idea that all the things around them are alive, and are in 
the Lord's life; which affects their inmosts with happiness. There are other kinds besides, for the varieties are innumerable, and are also unspeakable. </p>

<p align="center"><b>Elliott(1983-1999) 1621</b></p><p><b>1621.</b>
As regards the skies which surround the blessed, which are attributable to the light because they are the product of that light, they are countless; and such is their beauty and loveliness that they 
defy description. There are adamantine skies which glitter in every smallest part, as if made of tiny spherical diamonds. There are skies that resemble the sparkling of every precious stone. There are 
skies that look like great pearls with light streaming through their centres and shot through with the brightest colours. There are skies aflame as if made of gold or of silver, even of diamond-like 
gold and silver. There are skies consisting of flowers varying in colour, but too small to be seen individually. Such, in their countless varieties, fill the heaven of little children. Indeed skies also 
manifest themselves there which seem to contain the shapes of little children at play, but too small to be seen individually and perceptible solely in the inner recesses of the mind. From these shapes 
little children gain the idea that everything around them is alive and shares in the Lord's life. This idea gives them a feeling of happiness in their inmost being. There are many more kinds of skies, 
for their varieties are countless and beyond description. </p>

</p><b>1621.</b>
Quod atmosphaeras quae lucis sunt, quia ex luce illa, attinet, in quibus vivunt beati, sunt innumerabiles, et tanta pulchritudine et amoenitate ut describi non possint: sunt atmosphaerae adamantinae, 
quae fulgurant in omnibus minimis, sicut a diamantinis sphaerulis: sunt atmosphaerae rutilationi omnium lapidum pretiosorum similes: sunt atmosphaerae sicut unionum a centris pellucentium et radiatae 
coloribus nitidissimis: sunt atmosphaerae flammantes sicut ex auro, tum ex argento, etiam ex auro et argento adamantino: sunt atmosphaerae florum diversicolorum, qui in minimis et inconspicuis formis 
sunt; tales implent caelum infantum cum innumerabili varietate: immo etiam sistuntur atmosphaerae sicut ludentium infantum in minimis inconspicuis, sed perceptibilibus modo intima idea, formis, ex quibus 
infantes ideam capiunt quod omnia circum eos vivant, sintque in vita Domini, quae intima illorum afficit felicitate: praeter plures, nam varietates sunt innumerabiles, etiam ineffabiles. </p>
