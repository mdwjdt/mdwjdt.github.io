<h3 align="center" class="ired">属天的奥秘 第2125节</h3>
<h4 align="center"></h4><p><strong>2125.</strong>如今基督教会成员的品性通过代表物展现在我眼前。乌云笼罩下的灵人显得如此漆黑，以至于吓得我战栗不已。以后来的其他灵人没有这么可怕，我得到暗示，我将要见证一些事。首先，我看见孩子们正被他们的母亲残忍梳理，以致鲜血直流。这代表如今教养小孩子的性质。后来，一棵树出现了，我觉得它似乎是知识树。然后，一条大毒蛇，就是很恐怖的那种，似乎爬到那树上。它看似能伸展到整个树干的长度。这树与毒蛇消失后，那里出现了一只狗。就在这时，一扇门向一间屋子敞开，屋子里泛着如同燃煤发出的黄光，有两个女人在那里。我发觉这是一个厨房，但我不可以提及我在其中所看到的东西。我被告知，毒蛇所爬上的那棵树代表诸如当今教会成员所具有的那种状态；他们用伪诚实和欺骗所围困的致命仇恨取代了爱与仁；他们还对信的事物怀有恶毒的想法。不过，我在厨房所看到的东西代表那些仇恨和想法在未来的进一步发展。</p>

The present quality of the men of the Christian Church was exhibited to my view by means of representations. In a dark cloud there appeared spirits so black that I shuddered, and afterwards others not 
so horrible; and it was signified to me that I was about to see something. First, there appeared children who were being combed by their mothers so cruelly that the blood ran down; by which was represented 
that such is the bringing up of little children at this day. Afterwards there appeared a tree which seemed as if it were the tree of knowledge, into which there was seen to climb a great viper, 
such as to strike one with horror; it appeared to extend all along the trunk of the tree. When the tree with the viper vanished, there appeared a dog; and then a door was opened into an apartment where 
there was a yellow light as from coals, and there were two women there; it was perceived to be a kitchen, but I am not at liberty to mention what I saw therein. I was told that the tree into which 
the viper climbed represented the state of the men of the church as they are at this day, in that in place of love and charity they have deadly hatreds that are beset with pretenses of what is honorable, 
and with deceits, together with wicked thoughts concerning all matters that belong to the faith. But what was seen in the kitchen represented the same hatreds and thoughts in their further developments. </p>

The character of members of the Christian Church at the present day was demonstrated to me visually by means of representations. Enveloped by a dark cloud there appeared spirits so black that I shuddered. 
After that others not so terrifying made their appearance; and then it was indicated to me that I was about to witness something. First of all I saw children who were being combed by their mothers 
in so cruel a fashion that blood was running down. This represented the nature of young children's upbringing nowadays. Afterwards a tree appeared, which seemed to me to be the tree of knowledge. A 
large viper, the sort to strike terror, then seemed to climb up it. It appeared to extend up the whole length of the trunk. As the tree disappeared, along with the viper, a dog appeared, and at that 
point a door was opened into a room where there was a yellow light like that produced by coals burning. Two women were there. I perceived that it was a kitchen, but what I saw in it I am not allowed to 
mention. I was told that the tree which the viper climbed up represented the state of members of the Church as they are at the present time - that instead of love and charity they have deadly hatred 
that is hedged around by presences of honesty and by deceptions. They also have unmentionable thoughts about the things of faith. But what I saw in the kitchen represented that hatred and the nature 
of those thoughts in their further developments. </p>

Quales sunt homines Ecclesiae Christianae hodie, per repraesentationes mihi videndum exhibebatur: apparebant spiritus tam nigri ut horrescerem, in nube atra; et postea alii non ita horrendi; et significabatur 
mihi quod aliquid visurus: primum tunc visi pueri qui pecterentur a matribus tam crudeliter ut sanguis circumflueret; quo repraesentatum, quod talis sit hodie educatio infantum.  Postea apparuit 
arbor, et perceptum sicut foret arbor scientiae, in quam visa est magna vipera exsurgere, talis ut horrorem incuteret; apparebat illa secundum trunci longitudinem: evanescente arbore cum vipera, 
apparuit canis; et tunc aperta est janua in cameram ubi flavum luminosum sicut ex carbonibus, et ibi mulieres binae; perceptum quod esset culina, sed quae ibi visa, non memorare licet: dictum mihi, quod 
arbor in quam exsurgebat vipera, repraesentaret statum hominum Ecclesiae quales hodie sunt, quod loco amoris et charitatis iis sint internecina odia, etiam simulationibus honesti atque dolis circumobsessa; 
tum nefanda cogitata de illis quae sunt fidei; at quae visa in culina, repraesentabant odia illa (o)et cogitata qualia porro essent {2}. 	@1 sunt.$ </p>
