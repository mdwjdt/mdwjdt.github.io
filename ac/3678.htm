<h4 align="center"></h4><p><strong>3678.</strong>创世记28:6-9.以扫见以撒已经给雅各祝福，而且打发他往巴旦亚兰去，从那里娶妻，并见祝福的时候嘱咐他说，不要娶迦南的女子为妻。而雅各听从父母的话往巴旦亚兰去了。以扫就看出迦南的女子在他父亲以撒眼中为恶。以扫便去了以实玛利那里，在他二妻之外，又娶了玛哈拉为妻。她是亚伯拉罕儿子以实玛利的女儿，尼拜约的妹子。<br />“以扫见以撒已经给雅各祝福”表属世良善对于通过雅各所代表的真理良善（与神圣理性）结合的思维。“而且打发他往巴旦亚兰去”表（属世层）通过对那良善的认知而显现的开始。“从那里娶妻”表从而经由真理情感的结合。“并见祝福的时候嘱咐他说”表反思和由此而来的直觉，以便结合可以实现。“不要娶迦南的女子为妻”表它不可与对虚假并邪恶的情感结合。“而雅各听从父母的话”表顺从和情感。“往巴旦亚兰去了”在此和前面一样，表装备对那良善与真理的认知。“以扫就看出迦南的女子在他父亲以撒眼中为恶”表主预见并规定，此前与属世良善结合的真理情感不会有助于结合。“以扫便去了以实玛利那里，又娶了玛哈拉为妻，她是亚伯拉罕儿子以实玛利的女儿”表这良善与来自一个神性源头的真理结合。“尼拜约的妹子，在他二妻之外为妻”表对更为内在的属天真理的情感。</p>

Verses 6-9. And Esau saw that Isaac blessed Jacob, and sent him to Paddan-aram, to take him from thence a woman, and in blessing him commanded him, saying, Thou shalt not take a woman of the daughters 
of Canaan. And Jacob hearkened to his father and to his mother, and went to Paddan-aram. And Esau saw that the daughters of Canaan were evil in the eyes of Isaac his father. And Esau went to Ishmael, 
and took Mahalath, the daughter of Ishmael, Abraham's son, the sister of Nebaioth, over his women to himself for a woman. "And Esau saw that Isaac blessed Jacob," signifies the thought of natural good 
concerning conjunction by the good of truth, which is "Jacob;" "and sent him to Paddan-aram," signifies the beginning of manifestation through the knowledges of this good; "to take him from thence 
a woman," signifies conjunction thereby through the affection of truth; "and in blessing him commanded him, saying," signifies reflection and thence perception in order that conjunction might be effected; 
"thou shalt not take a woman of the daughters of Canaan," signifies that he should not be conjoined with the affections of falsity and evil; "and Jacob hearkened to his father and to his mother," 
signifies obedience and affection; and went to Paddan-aram," signifies here as above to become imbued with those knowledges of good and truth; "and Esau saw that the daughters of Canaan were evil in 
the eyes of Isaac his father," signifies the Lord's foresight and providence that the affections of that truth with which natural good had been heretofore conjoined would not conduce to conjunction; "and 
Esau went to Ishmael, and took Mahalath, the daughter of Ishmael, Abraham's son," signifies the conjunction of this good with truth from a Divine origin; "the sister of Nebaioth, over his women to 
himself for a woman," signifies the affection of celestial truth more interiorly. </p>

Verses 6-9 And Esau saw that Isaac had blessed Jacob and had sent him away to Paddan Aram to take a wife for himself from there, and in blessing him had commanded him, saying, You shall not take a wife 
from the daughters of Canaan; and that Jacob had listened to his father and to his mother, and had gone to Paddan Aram. And Esau saw that the daughters of Canaan were evil in the eyes of Isaac his 
father. And Esau went to Ishmael, and took Mahalath the daughter of Ishmael, Abraham's son, the sister of Nebaioth, as a wife (mulier) in addition to the wives (femina) he had. </p>
<p>'Esau saw that Isaac 
had blessed Jacob' means the thought which natural good had regarding the joining [to the Divine Rational] through the good of truth, represented by 'Jacob'. 'And had sent him away to Paddan Aram' means 
the beginning of the manifestation [of the Natural] through cognitions of that good. 'To take a wife for himself from there' means a joining together thereby through the affection for truth. 'In blessing 
him had commanded him, saying' means reflection and consequent perception so that the joining together might be effected. 'You shall not take a wife from the daughters of Canaan' means that it 
had not to be joined to affections for falsity and evil. 'And that Jacob had listened to his father and to his mother' means obedience and affection. 'And had gone to Paddan Aram' means here, as previously, 
so as to be furnished with those cognitions of good and truth. 'And Esau saw that the daughters of Canaan were evil in the eyes of Isaac his father' means the Lord's foresight and provision that 
the affections for that truth - the affections to which natural good had been joined until then - would not be suitable for such conjunction. 'And Esau went to Ishmael, and took Mahalath the daughter 
of Ishmael, Abraham's son' means the joining of that good to truth from a Divine source. 'The sister of Nebaioth, as a wife in addition to the wives he had' means an affection for celestial truth more 
internally. </p>

Vers. 6-9.  Et vidit Esau, quod benedixerit Jischak Jacobo, et miserit illum Paddanem Aram, ad accipiendum sibi exinde mulierem, in benedicendo eum illi, et praeceperit super illum, dicendo, Non accipies 
mulierem e filiabus Canaan.  Et audiverit Jacob ad patrem suum, et ad matrem suam, et iverit Paddanem Aram.  Et vidit Esau, quod malae filiae Canaan in oculis Jischaki patris sui.  Et ivit Esau 
ad Jishmael, et accepit Mahalath filiam Jishmaelis filii Abrahami, sororem Nebaioth, super feminas suas sibi ad mulierem.  `Vidit Esau quod benedixerit Jischak Jacobo' significat cogitationem boni naturalis 
de conjunctione per veri bonum quod Jacob:  `et miserit illum Paddanem Aram' significat initium existentiae per cognitiones illius boni:  `ad accipiendum sibi exinde mulierem' significat sic 
conjunctionem per affectionem veri:  `in benedicendo eum illi, et praeceperit super illum, dicendo' significat ut conjunctio fieret, reflexionem et inde perceptionem:  `Non accipies mulierem e filiabus 
Canaan' significat quod non conjungeretur affectionibus falsi et mali:  `et audiverit Jacob ad patrem suum et ad matrem suam significat oboedientiam et affectionem:  `et iverit Paddanem Aram' significat, 
hic ut prius, ad imbuendum cognitiones boni et veri illas:  `et vidit Esau quod malae filiae Canaan in oculis Jischaki patris sui' significat praevidentiam et providentiam Domini quod affectiones 
veri illius cum quibus bonum naturale hactenus conjunctum esset, non conducerent ad conjunctionem:  `et ivit Esau ad Jishmael, et accepit Mahalath filiam Jishmaelis filii Abrahami' significat conjunctionem 
boni illius cum vero ex origine Divina:  `sororem Nebaioth super feminas suas sibi ad mulierem' significat affectionem veri caelestis interius. </p>
