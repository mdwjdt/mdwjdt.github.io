<h4 align="center"></h4><p><strong>4471.</strong>创世记34:18-24.他们的话在哈抹的眼中和他儿子示剑的眼中看为美。那少年人行这话并不迟延，因为他喜爱雅各的女儿。他在他父亲全家族中也是最受尊重的。哈抹和他儿子示剑到本城的门口，对本城的人讲说：这些人与我们和睦，不如许他们在这地居住，做买卖；看哪，这地在他们面前也宽阔。我们可以娶他们的女儿为妻，也可以把我们的女儿嫁给他们。惟有一个条件，这些人才肯应允和我们同住，成为一样的人民；就是我们中间所有的男丁都要受割礼，和他们受割礼一样。他们的群畜、货财和一切的牲口岂不都归我们吗？只要我们依从他们，他们就与我们同住。凡出他城门的人，就都听从哈抹和他儿子示剑的话。于是，他们就给凡出他城门的所有男丁都行了割礼。<br />“他们的话在哈抹的眼中看为美”表在生活上的俯就。“和他儿子示剑的眼中”表在教义上。“那少年人行这话并不迟延”表强烈的接受渴望。“因为他喜爱雅各的女儿”表这个教会的宗教表象。“他在他父亲全家族中也是最受尊重的”表这个教会的真理在古人当中是首要的。“哈抹和他儿子示剑到本城的门口”表在那些属古人当中的教会之人的教义里面的良善与真理。“对本城的人讲说”表劝说。“这些人与我们和睦”表一致。“不如许他们在这地居住”表在生活上。“做买卖”表在教义上。“看哪，这地在他们面前也宽阔”表延伸。“我们可以娶他们的女儿为妻，也可以把我们的女儿嫁给他们”表联结。“惟有一个条件，这些人才肯应允和我们同住”表他们将在生活上取得一致。“成为一样的人民”表在教义上。“就是我们中间所有的男丁都要受割礼，和他们受割礼一样”表只要他们通过这种方式唯独在外在方面被引入他们的代表和有意义的符号。“他们的群畜、货财”表他们的真理。“和一切的牲口”表他们的良善。“岂不都归我们吗”表这两种良善与真理将是一样的，并具有相同的形式。“只要我们依从他们，他们就与我们同住”表若我们俯就。“（他们）就都听从哈抹和他儿子示剑的话”表同意。“凡出他城门的人”表他们将背离古人当中的教会教义。“于是，他们就给凡出他城门的所有男丁都行了割礼”表对外在事物的接受。</p>

Verses 18-24. And their words were good in the eyes of Hamor, and in the eyes of Shechem Hamor's son. And the lad delayed not to do the word, because he was well pleased in Jacob's daughter; and he was 
honored above all the house of his father. And Hamor and Shechem his son came unto the gate of their city, and spoke unto the men of their city, saying, These men are peaceable with us, and let them 
dwell in the land, and range through it trading, and behold the land is broad in spaces before them; let us take their daughters to us for women, and let us give our daughters to them. Nevertheless 
in this will the men consent to us to dwell with us, to be for one people, in every male being circumcised to us, even as they are circumcised. Their acquisition, and their purchase, and all their beast, 
will they not be ours? Only let us consent to them, and they will dwell with us. And they listened to Hamor and to Shechem his son, all that went out of the gate of his city; and they circumcised 
every male, all that went out of the gate of his city. "And their words were good in the eyes of Hamor," signifies condescension in respect to the life; "and in the eyes of Shechem Hamor's son," signifies 
in respect to the doctrine; "and the lad delayed not to do the word," signifies a longing to accept; "because he was well pleased in Jacob's daughter," signifies in relation to the religiosity of 
that church; "and he was honored above all the house of his father," signifies what is primary of the truths of the Church among the Ancients; "and Hamor and Shechem his son came unto the gate of their 
city," signifies the goods and truths that were in the doctrine of those who belonged to the Church among the Ancients; "and spoke unto the men of their city, saying," signifies persuasion; "these 
men are peaceable with us," signifies agreement; "and let them dwell in the land," signifies in respect to life; "and range through it trading," signifies in respect to doctrine; "and behold the land 
is broad in spaces before them," signifies the extension; "let us take their daughters to us for women, and let us give our daughters to them," signifies conjunction; "nevertheless in this will the men 
consent to us to dwell with us," signifies that they would agree in respect to life; "to be for one people," signifies in respect to doctrine; "in every male being circumcised to us even as they are 
circumcised," signifies provided they would be initiated thereby into their representatives and significatives in respect to external things alone; "their acquisition, and their purchase," signifies 
their truths; "and all their beast," signifies their goods; "will they not be ours?" signifies that these were alike and of one form; "only let us consent to them, and they will dwell with us," signifies 
if we condescend; "and they listened to Hamor and to Shechem his son," signifies consent; "all that went out of the gate of his city," signifies that they would recede from the doctrine of the Church 
among the Ancients; "and they circumcised every male, all that went out of the gate of his city," signifies accession to external things. </p>

Verses 18-24 And their words were good in the eyes of Hamor and in the eyes of Shechem, Hamor's son. And the young man did not delay to do the thing, because he delighted in Jacob's daughter; and he 
was honoured above all those of his father's house. And Hamor came, then Shechem his son, to the gate of their city, and they spoke to the men of their city, saying, These men are at peace with us; let 
them dwell in the land and carry on trade throughout it; behold, the land is broad and spacious before them. Let us take their daughters to us as wives (femina), and let us give our daughters to them. 
Only on this [condition] will the men consent to us to dwell with us, to be one people: That every male among us be circumcised, as they are circumcised. Their acquisition,<A name="fntext1"></a><A href="#fn1"><sup>a</sup></a> and their purchase, and 
all their beasts, will these not be ours? Only let us consent to them, and they will dwell with us. And they listened to Hamor and Shechem his son, all who went out of the gate of his city; and they 
circumcised every male, all who went out of the gate of his city. </p>
<p>'Their words were good in the eyes of Hamor' means conformity in life. 'And in the eyes of Shechem, Hamor's son' means in doctrine. 
'And the young man did not delay to do the thing' means a strong desire to accept. 'Because he delighted in Jacob's daughter' means the semblance of religion in that Church. 'And he was honoured above

land' means in life. 'And carry on trade throughout it' means in doctrine. 'Behold, the land is broad and spacious before them' means extension. 'Let us take their daughters to us as wives, and let 
us give our daughters to them' means a joining together. 'Only on this [condition] will the men consent to us to dwell with us' means that they would agree in life. 'To be one people' means in doctrine. 
'That every male be circumcised, as they are circumcised' means provided they were introduced by this means into their representatives and meaningful signs, solely into the external observances involved 
in these. 'Their acquisition, and their purchase' means their truths. 'And all their beasts' means goods. 'Will these not be ours?' means that these two kinds of goods and truths would be alike 
and take the same form. 'Only let us consent to them, and they will dwell with us' means, If we conform to this. 'And they listened to Hamor and Shechem his son' means consent. 'All who went out of the 
gate of his city' means that they departed from the doctrine of the Church among the Ancients. 'And they circumcised every male, all who went out of the gate of his city' means the acceptance of externalities.

Vers. 18-24.  Et bona fuerunt verba illorum in oculis Hamoris et in oculis Shechemi filii Hamoris.  Et non tardavit puer facere verbum, quia beneplacuit in filia Jacobi, et ille honoratus prae omnibus 
domus patris sui.  Et venit Hamor et Shechem filius illius ad portam urbis suae, et locuti ad viros urbis suae, dicendo, Viri illi pacifici ii cum nobis, et habitent in terra, et negotiando pervagentur 
eam, et terra ecce lata spatiis coram illis; </p>
<p>filias illorum accipiamus nobis ad feminas, et filias nostras demus illis.  Verumtamen in hoc consentient nobis viri ad habitandum cum nobis, 
ad esse in populum unum, in circumcidi nobis omnem masculum, quemadmodum illi circumcisi. Acquisitio illorum, et emptio illorum, et omnis bestia illorum, annon nobis illa? tantummodo consentiamus illis, 
et habitabunt cum nobis.  Et audiverunt ad Hamorem et ad Shechemum filium illius omnes egredientes portam urbis ejus, et circumciderunt omnem masculum, omnes egredientes portam urbis illius.

ad habitandum cum nobis' significat quod concordarent quoad vitam: `ad esse in populum unum' significat quoad doctrinam: `in circumcidi omnem masculum quemadmodum illi circumcisi' significat si
