<h3 align="center" class="ired">属天的奥秘 第2649节</h3>
<h4 align="center"></h4><p><strong>2649.</strong>“给以撒断奶的日子”表分离的状态。这从“日子”和“断奶”的含义清楚可知：“日子”是指状态（参看<a href="23.htm">23</a>，<a href="487.htm">487</a>，<a href="488.htm">488</a>，<a href="493.htm">493</a>，<a href="893.htm">893</a>节）；“断奶”是指分离（参看<a href="2647.htm">2647</a>节）。从本章第一节开始，经上就按照以下次序 论述了主的神性本质和其人性本质的融合：神性在人性中的存在是为了这二者的融合（1节）。人性在神性中的存在，因而相互融合（参看<a href="2004.htm">2004</a>节）（2节）。人性通过这种融合变成神性（3节）。这个过程是主在世时逐渐并不断实现的（4节）。当理性处于接受的状态时，这个过程就开始进行（5节）。经上描述了融合的状态，即该状态的性质及其奥秘（6，7节）。接下来直到12节，经上描述了来自母亲的人身的分离。在本节，这种分离由以撒断奶来表示，并由“夏甲的儿子被赶出家门”来代表。由于主的神性与其人性，并人性与神性的融合就是善与真的婚姻本身，天上的婚姻源于该婚姻，而天上的婚姻与主的国度是一回事，故经上提到了以撒断奶时亚伯拉罕所设摆的“大筵席”，以此表示婚姻的开始或初次融合。若非这“筵席”和“断奶”具有某种隐藏的含义，经上决不会提及。<br />由于接下来论述的主题是主从母亲所得来的最初人身的分离，直到最后完全除去它，所以要知道，主逐渐并不断将纯人性之物从祂自己那里分离出去，并弃之，直到祂得荣耀之时的生命最后一刻。也就是说，祂抛弃了自己从母亲所得来之物，直到最终不再是她的儿子，而是神的儿子，不但在成孕时是，而且在出生时也是，从而与父为一，就是耶和华自己。主将来自母亲的全部人性从祂自己那里分离出去，并弃之，以致祂不再是她的儿子。这一事实从主在约翰福音中所说的话很清楚地看出来：<br />酒用尽了，耶稣的母亲对祂说，他们没有酒了。耶稣对她说，妇人，我与你有什么相干？（约翰福音<a href="http://39-27.cn/约2.3.htm">2:3</a>，<a href="http://39-27.cn/约2.4.htm">4</a>）<br />马太福音<br />有一个人说，看哪，你母亲和你弟兄站在外边，想法子要与你说话。耶稣却回答他说，谁是我的母亲？谁是我的弟兄？就伸手指着祂的门徒说，看哪，我的母亲，我的弟兄。凡遵行我天父旨意的人，就是我的弟兄、姐妹和母亲了。（马太福音<a href="http://39-27.cn/太12.47.htm">12:47</a>-<a href="http://39-27.cn/太12.50.htm">50</a>；马可福音<a href="http://39-27.cn/可3.2.htm">3:2</a>-<a href="http://39-27.cn/可3.35.htm">35</a>；路加福音<a href="http://39-27.cn/路8.20.htm">8:20</a>，<a href="http://39-27.cn/路8.21.htm">21</a>）<br />路加福音：<br />有一个女人从人群中提高声音对他说，怀过你的胎和你所吮吸过的乳房有福了！但耶稣说，听神之道而遵守的人是有福的。（路加福音<a href="http://39-27.cn/路11.27.htm">11:27</a>，<a href="http://39-27.cn/路11.28.htm">28</a>）<br />此处，当那个女人提到祂的母亲时，祂说了上述一番话，也就是说“凡遵行我天父旨意的人，就是我的弟兄、姐妹和母亲了”。约翰福音：<br />耶稣见祂母亲和祂所爱的那门徒站在旁边，就对祂母亲说，妇人，看，你的儿子！又对那门徒说，看，你的母亲！从那时起，那门徒就接她到自己家里去了。（约翰福音<a href="http://39-27.cn/约19.26.htm">19:26</a>，<a href="http://39-27.cn/约19.27.htm">27</a>）<br />从这些话明显看出，主照着她看见祂在十字架上时的想法而对她说话，即便那时，祂也没有称她为母亲，而是叫她妇人，祂将母亲这个名转给了那些门徒所表示的人；因此，祂对门徒说：“看，你的母亲”。这个问题从主自己在马太福音中的话看得更清楚：<br />耶稣问法利赛人说，论到基督，你们以为怎样？祂是谁的子孙呢？”他们对祂说，是大卫的子孙。祂对他们说，那么，大卫在灵里怎么还称祂为主，说，主对我主说，你坐在我的右手边，等我把你仇敌放在你的脚凳下？大卫既称祂为主，祂怎么又是大卫的子孙呢？没有一个人能回答祂一言。（马太福音<a href="http://39-27.cn/太22.41.htm">22:41</a>-<a href="http://39-27.cn/太22.46.htm">46</a>；马可福音<a href="http://39-27.cn/可12.35.htm">12:35</a>-<a href="http://39-27.cn/可12.37.htm">37</a>；路加福音<a href="http://39-27.cn/路20.42.htm">20:42</a>-<a href="http://39-27.cn/路20.44.htm">44</a>）<br />因此，就肉体而言，祂不再是大卫的子孙。<br />至于分享并抛弃来自母亲的人身，有必要补充的是，那些对主的人身持纯粹肉体观念，认为它和其他人的人身没什么不同的人并不理解这一点。对这类人来说，诸如此类的事就是绊脚石。他们不知道，生命如何，这个人就如何；生命的神性存在或耶和华自成孕时就在主里面，并且这生命的存在通过融合而在祂的人身中彰显。</p>

<p align="center"><b>Potts(1905-1910) 2649</b></p><p><b>2649.</b>
On the day when he weaned Isaac. That this signifies the state of separation, is evident from the signification of "day," as being state (see n. 23, 487, 488, 493, 893); and from the signification of 
"being weaned," as being to be separated (see n. 2647). From the first verse of this chapter the uniting of the Lord's Divine Essence with His Human Essence has been treated of, in this order: The presence 
of the Divine in the Human for the sake of unition (verse 1). The presence of the Human in the Divine, and thus a reciprocal unition (see n. 2004) (verse 2). From this unition the Human was made 
Divine (verse 3). And this successively and continually while the Lord lived in the world (verse 4). And this commenced when the rational was in a state to receive (verse 5). The state of the unition 
is described as to its quality, with its arcana (verses 6, 7). Now follows the separation of the maternal human, and this is continued down to verse 12; which separation is signified in this verse by 
the weaning of Isaac, and is represented in the following verses by Hagar's son being sent away out of the house. And as the union of the Lord's Divine with His Human and of His Human with His Divine 
is the very marriage of good and truth, and from it is the heavenly marriage, which is the same as the Lord's kingdom, therefore a great feast is mentioned which Abraham made when he weaned Isaac, by 
which the beginning of marriage or the first union is signified; which feast and weaning, but for the signification, would never have been mentioned.  [2] As the separation of the first human, which 
the Lord had from the mother, now follows, and at length the full removal of it, it is to be known that the Lord gradually and continually, even to the last of His life when He was glorified, separated 
from Himself and put off that which was merely human, namely, that which He derived from the mother, until at length He was no longer her son, but the Son of God, not only as to conception but also 
as to birth, and thus was one with the Father, and was Jehovah Himself. That He separated from Himself and put off all the human from the mother, so that He was no longer her son, is manifest from His 
words in John: </p>
<p>     When the wine failed, the mother of Jesus said unto Him, They have no wine. Jesus saith unto her, Woman, what [belongs] to Me and to thee ? (John 2:3, 4). In Matthew: </p>
<p>     One 
said, Behold, Thy mother and Thy brethren stand without, seeking to speak to Thee. But Jesus answering said unto him that told Him, Who is My mother? and who are My brethren? And stretching forth His 
hand toward His disciples, He said, Behold My mother, and My brethren; for whosoever shall do the will of My Father who is in the heavens, the same is My brother, and sister, and mother (Matt. 12:47-50; 
Mark 3:2-35; Luke 8:20, 21). In Luke: </p>
<p>     A certain woman out of the multitude lifting up her voice, said unto Him, Blessed is the womb that bare Thee, and the breasts which Thou didst suck. But 
Jesus said, Blessed are they that hear the Word of God, and keep it (Luke 11:27, 28). [3] Here, when the woman spoke of His mother, the Lord spoke of those described above, namely, "Whoever shall 
do the will of My Father, the same is My brother, and sister, and mother;" which is the same as this, "Blessed are they that hear the Word of God, and keep it." In John: </p>
<p>     Jesus seeing His mother 
and the disciple whom He loved standing by, said unto His mother, Woman, behold thy son. Then said He to the disciple, Behold thy mother. Therefore from that hour the disciple took her to his own home 
(John 19:26, 27). From these words it is manifest that the Lord spoke to her according to her thought when she saw Him on the cross, and even then not calling her mother, but "woman;" and that He transferred 
the name of mother to those who are signified by the disciple; on which account He said to the disciple, "Behold thy mother." Still more manifest is this from the Lord's own words, in Matthew: </p>
<p> 
    Jesus asked the Pharisees, saying, What think ye of Christ? whose son is He? They say unto Him, David's. He saith unto them, How then doth David in the spirit call Him Lord, saying, The Lord 
said unto my Lord, Sit Thou on My right hand until I make Thine enemies Thy foot stool? If David therefore call Him Lord, how is He his Son ? And no one was able to answer Him a word (Matt. 22:41-46 Mark 
12:35-37 Luke 20:42-44). Thus He was no longer the Son of David as to the flesh.  [4] And further, in regard to the separation and putting off of the maternal human those do not comprehend this 
who have merely corporeal ideas respecting the Lord's Human, and think of it as of the human of any other man; hence to such these things are stumbling-blocks. They do not know that such as the life is 
such is the man, and that the Divine Esse [Being] of life, or Jehovah, was in the Lord from conception, and that a similar Esse of life came forth in His Human by means of the union. </p>

<p align="center"><b>Elliott(1983-1999) 2649</b></p><p><b>2649.</b>
'On the day when he was to wean Isaac' means a state of separation. This is clear from the meaning of 'day' as state, dealt with in <a href="23.htm">23</a>, <a href="487.htm">487</a>, <a href="488.htm">488</a>, <a href="493.htm">493</a>, <a href="893.htm">893</a>, and from the meaning of 'being weaned' as being 
separated, dealt with in <a href="2647.htm">2647</a>. Verse 1 onwards of this chapter has dealt in the following order with the Lord's Divine Essence united to His Human Essence: </p>
<p> The presence of the Divine within the 
Human, for the sake of the two being united, verse 1. The presence of the Human within the Divine, and thus a reciprocal union, dealt with in <a href="2004.htm">2004</a>, verse 2, From that union the Human was made Divine, 
verse 3. This was effected gradually and constantly while the Lord lived in the world, verse 4. It started to be effected when the rational was in a state to receive, verse 5. The nature of the 
state of union is described, together with the arcana of that state, verses 6, 7. </p>
<p>Now reference follows, and is continued through to verse 12, to the separation of the human received from the mother. 
That separation is meant in this present verse by 'the weaning of Isaac', and in those that follow it is represented by Hagar's son being cast out of the house. And because the union of the Lord's 
Divine with His Human, and of the Human with the Divine, is the marriage itself of Good and Truth, and from this marriage is derived the heavenly marriage, which is the same as the Lord's kingdom, mention 
is therefore made of 'a great feast which Abraham made when Isaac was weaned', by which is meant the first stage of that marriage or the first union. Unless this 'feast', and also the weaning, had 
had some hidden meaning, it would never have been mentioned. </p>
<p></p>
<p><b>[2]</b>
 Since the subject which follows now is the separation of the first human which the Lord had from the mother and the total casting 
off of it ultimately, it should be recognized that right to the end of His life when He was glorified the Lord gradually and constantly separated from Himself and cast off that which was merely human. 
That is to say, He cast off that which He had derived from the mother, until ultimately He was no longer her son but the Son of God not only in conception but also in birth, and so was one with the 
Father and was Jehovah himself. The truth that He separated from Himself and cast off the whole of the human received from the mother, insomuch that He was her son no longer, is plainly evident from the 
Lord's own words in John, </p>
<blockquote>
When the wine failed, the mother of Jesus said to Him, They have no wine. Jesus said to her, O woman, What have you to do with Me? <a href="http://bible.gospelcom.net/cgi-bin/bible?passage=John%202:-3,%204&amp;version=ESV&amp;interface=print&amp;showfn=yes&amp;showxref">John 2:-3, 4</a>. 
</blockquote>
<p>In Matthew, </p>
<blockquote>
Someone 
said, Behold, Your mother and Your brothers are standing outside asking to speak to You. But Jesus answering said to the one who had told Him, Who is My mother, and who are My brothers? And stretching 
out His hand over His disciples He said, Behold My mother and My brothers; for whoever does the will of My Father who is in heaven is My brother, and sister, and mother. <a href="http://bible.gospelcom.net/cgi-bin/bible?passage=Matt%2012:%2047-50&amp;version=ESV&amp;interface=print&amp;showfn=yes&amp;showxref">Matt 12: 47-50</a>; <a href="http://bible.gospelcom.net/cgi-bin/bible?passage=Mark%203:%2032-35&amp;version=ESV&amp;interface=print&amp;showfn=yes&amp;showxref">Mark 3: 32-35</a>; 
<a href="http://bible.gospelcom.net/cgi-bin/bible?passage=Luke%2011:%2027,%2028&amp;version=ESV&amp;interface=print&amp;showfn=yes&amp;showxref">Luke 11: 27, 28</a>. 
</blockquote>
<p>In Luke, </p>
<blockquote>
A certain woman lifting up her voice out of the crowd<A name="fntext1"></a><A href="#fn1"><sup>a</sup></a> said to Him, Blessed is the womb that bore You, and the breasts that You sucked. But Jesus said, Blessed are 
those who hear the word of God and keep it. <a href="http://bible.gospelcom.net/cgi-bin/bible?passage=Luke%2011:-27,%2028&amp;version=ESV&amp;interface=print&amp;showfn=yes&amp;showxref">Luke 11:-27, 28</a>. 
</blockquote>
<p></p>
<p><b>[3]</b>
 Here, when the woman referred to His mother, the Lord spoke of those mentioned in the preceding quotation. That is to say, He spoke 
of 'whoever does the will of My Father is My brother, sister, and mother', which amounts to the same as saying, 'Blessed are those who hear the word of God and keep it'. In John, </p>
<blockquote>
Jesus seeing his 
mother, and the disciple whom He loved standing by, said to His mother, O woman, behold your son! Then He said to the disciple, Behold your mother! From that hour therefore the disciple took her to his 
own home. <a href="http://bible.gospelcom.net/cgi-bin/bible?passage=John%2019:-26,%2027&amp;version=ESV&amp;interface=print&amp;showfn=yes&amp;showxref">John 19:-26, 27</a>. 
</blockquote>
<p>From these words it is evident that the Lord spoke to her according to what she was thinking when she saw Him on the Cross - though He does not call her mother but woman 
- and that He gave the name mother instead to those meant by the disciple; hence His words to the disciple, Behold your mother! The matter is plainer still from the Lord's own words in Matthew, </p>
<blockquote>
Jesus 
questioned the Pharisees saying, What do you think about the Christ? Whose son is He? They said to Him, David's. He said to them, How is it then that David in the spirit calls Him Lord, saying, 
The Lord said to my Lord, Sit at My right hand until I make Your enemies Your footstool. If therefore David calls Him Lord, how is He his son? And no one was able to answer Him a word. <a href="http://bible.gospelcom.net/cgi-bin/bible?passage=Matt%2022:%2041-end&amp;version=ESV&amp;interface=print&amp;showfn=yes&amp;showxref">Matt 22: 41-end</a>; 
<a href="http://bible.gospelcom.net/cgi-bin/bible?passage=Mark%2012:%2035-37&amp;version=ESV&amp;interface=print&amp;showfn=yes&amp;showxref">Mark 12: 35-37</a>; <a href="http://bible.gospelcom.net/cgi-bin/bible?passage=Luke%2020:-42-44&amp;version=ESV&amp;interface=print&amp;showfn=yes&amp;showxref">Luke 20:-42-44</a>. 
</blockquote>
<p>Accordingly He was no longer David's son as to the flesh. </p>
<p></p>
<p><b>[4]</b>
 As regards the separation and casting off of the human from the mother, it must be added that they 
have no conception of this who entertain merely bodily ideas about the Lord's Human and think of it as they do of the human of any other. To such people these matters are as a consequence stumbling-blocks. 
They do not know that as is the life so is the person, and that the Divine Being (Esse) of life, or Jehovah, was the Lord's from conception and that a similar Being (Esse) of life manifested itself 
within His Human through union.
