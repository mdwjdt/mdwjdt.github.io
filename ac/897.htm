<h4 align="center"></h4><p><strong>897.</strong>由于此处论述的是古教会成员的重生，故“看”表承认和拥有信。从圣言可以看出，“看”具有这样的意义。如以赛亚书：<br />你不仰望做这事的主，也不顾念从古定这事的。（以赛亚书<a href="http://39-27.cn/赛22.11.htm">22:11</a>）<br />这论及锡安城，“不仰望从古定这事的”表甚至不承认，更不用说拥有信了。同一先知书：<br />要使这百姓心蒙脂油，耳朵发沉，眼睛昏迷；恐怕眼睛看见，耳朵听见，心里明白，回转过来，便得医治。（以赛亚书<a href="http://39-27.cn/赛6.10.htm">6:10</a>）<br />“眼睛看见”表承认和拥有信。<br />在黑暗中行走的百姓看见了大光。（以赛亚书<a href="http://39-27.cn/赛9.2.htm">9:2</a>）<br />这论及接受信的外邦人，如本节，即“他移开方舟的盖观看”所论及的。<br />当那日，聋子必听见这书上的话，瞎子的眼必从幽暗晦暝中得以看见。（以赛亚书<a href="http://39-27.cn/赛29.18.htm">29:18</a>）<br />这论及外邦人信仰的转变。“看”表接受信。<br />你们这耳聋的，听吧，你们这眼瞎的，看吧，好看得见。（以赛亚书<a href="http://39-27.cn/赛42.18.htm">42:18</a>）<br />此处的意义也一样。以西结书：<br />他们有眼可看却看不见，有耳可听却听不见，因为他们是悖逆之家。（以西结书<a href="http://39-27.cn/结12.2.htm">12:2</a>）<br />这表能理解、承认、有信，然而却不愿意之人。“看”表拥有信，这一点可从旷野中的铜蛇代表主很清楚地看出来，当时，凡注视它的人都会被治愈，对此，摩西五经上说：<br />你将一条蛇，挂在杆子上，凡被咬的，一看这蛇，就必得活。摩西便制造一条铜蛇，挂在杆子上，凡被蛇咬的，一看见这铜蛇，就活了。（民数记<a href="http://39-27.cn/民21.8.htm">21:8</a>-<a href="http://39-27.cn/民21.9.htm">9</a>）<br />谁都能由此清楚看出，“看”表信，因为这个例子中，“看”除了代表信主外，还能是什么？这一点从以下事实也能清楚看出来，即流便，雅各布（Jacob）的长子，因“看见”而得其名，“看”的内义表信（参看前面有关教会头生的论述，<a href="352.htm">352</a>，<a href="367.htm">367</a>节）。</p>

<p><strong>[NCE]897.</strong> Since the subject here is regenerate people in the ancient church, looking [or seeing] symbolizes acknowledging and believing. This symbolism can be seen in the Word. In Isaiah, for instance:<br />You have not looked to its maker, and the one who formed it from long ago you have not seen. (<a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_897/bible_king-james-version_isaiah_22_11" target=_top>Isaiah 22:11</a>)<br />This is about the city of Zion. Not seeing the one who formed it from long ago is failing to acknowledge him, still less to put faith in him. In the same author:<br />Make the heart of this people fat and make their ears heavy and smear over their eyes, to prevent them from seeing with their eyes and hearing with their ears and understanding in their heart and turning and being healed. (<a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_897/bible_king-james-version_isaiah_6_9-10" target=_top>Isaiah 6:9-10</a>)<br />Seeing with the eyes stands for acknowledging and believing. In the same author:<br />The people walking in darkness have seen great light. (<a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_897/bible_king-james-version_isaiah_9_2" target=_top>Isaiah 9:2</a>)<br />This is about nations that had received the faith. It is like the current verse where it says "he removed the roof and saw." In the same author:<br />On that day, the deaf will hear the words of the Book, and out of the darkness and out of the shadows the eyes of the blind will see. (<a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_897/bible_king-james-version_isaiah_29_18" target=_top>Isaiah 29:18</a>)<br />This is about the conversion of the nations to the faith. Seeing stands for embracing the faith. In the same author:<br />You who are deaf, listen! And you who are blind, look and see! (<a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_897/bible_king-james-version_isaiah_42_18" target=_top>Isaiah 42:18</a>)<br />The meaning is similar.<br />[2] In Ezekiel:<br />... who have eyes to see and do not see, who have ears to hear and do not hear, because they are a rebellious house. (<a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_897/bible_king-james-version_ezekiel_12_2" target=_top>Ezekiel 12:2</a>)<br />These words mean, "who are able to understand, acknowledge, and believe, but do not wish to."<br />The representation of the Lord by the bronze serpent in the wilderness provides clear evidence that seeing symbolizes believing, since everyone who looked at it was cured. Moses describes it this way:<br />"Put the snake on a pole, and it will happen that all who have been bitten and see it will live." It happened that if a snake bit a man and he looked at the bronze snake, he lived. (<a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_897/bible_king-james-version_numbers_21_8-9" target=_top>Numbers 21:8-9</a>)<br />From this everyone can see that looking or seeing symbolizes faith. What could seeing in this passage be if not an act representing faith in the Lord?<br />Another conclusion from this is that on an inner level, Jacob's firstborn — Reuben, whose name comes from a word for seeing{*1} — symbolizes faith. See earlier remarks concerning the church's firstborns at <a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_897/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_352" target=_top>352</a> and <a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_897/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_367" target=_top>367</a>.<br /><br /><strong>Footnotes:</strong><br />{*1} Swedenborg here is accepting the biblical association of the name רְאוּבֵן (rǝ'ûḇēn), or "Reuben," with the verb רָאָה (rā'ā), "to see." See <a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_897/bible_king-james-version_genesis_29_32" target=_top>Genesis 29:32</a>: "And Leah conceived and bore a son and called his name Reuben, because she said, ‘Jehovah has seen my affliction, for now my husband will love me.'"

In this place, the subject being the man of the Ancient Church when regenerated, by "seeing" is signified acknowledging and having faith. That "seeing" has this signification is evident from the Word; 
as in Isaiah: </p>
<p>     Ye looked not unto the Maker thereof, and the Former thereof from afar ye have not seen (Isa. 22:11), speaking of the city of Zion; "not to see the Former from afar" is not to acknowledge, 
still less to have faith. Again:       Make the heart of this people fat, and make their ears heavy, and smear over their eyes, lest they see with their eyes, and hear with their ears, and 
their heart should understand, and turn again, and be healed (Isa. 6:10); </p>
<p>"to see with their eyes" denotes acknowledging and having faith. Again: </p>
<p>     The people that walked in darkness have seen 
a great light (Isa. 9:2), said of the Gentiles who received faith; as it is here said of Noah, that he "removed the covering and saw." Again: </p>
<p>     And in that day shall the deaf hear the words of the 
Book, and the eyes of the blind shall see out of thick darkness and out of darkness (Isa. 29:18), speaking of the conversion of the Gentiles to faith; "to see" denotes to receive faith. Again: </p>
<p>   
  Hear, ye deaf and look, ye blind, that ye may see (Isa. 42:18), where the meaning is similar. In Ezekiel: </p>
<p>     Who have eyes to see, and see not, who have ears to hear, and hear not; for they are a 
rebellious house (Ezek. 12:2), meaning who can understand, acknowledge, and have faith, and yet will not. That "to see" signifies to have faith, is evident from the representation of the Lord by the 
brazen serpent in the wilderness, on seeing which all were healed; as in Moses: </p>
<p>     Make thee a fiery serpent, and set it upon a standard; and it shall come to pass that everyone that is bitten, when 
he seeth it, shall live; and it came to pass that if a serpent had bitten any man, when he looked unto the serpent of brass, he lived (Num. 21:8, 9); </p>
<p>from which passage everyone can see that "to see" 
signifies faith; for what would seeing avail in this case, except as a representative of faith in the Lord? Hence also it is evident that Reuben, Jacob's firstborn, being so called from "seeing" signifies 
in the internal sense faith. (See what was said before about the firstborn of the church, n. 352, 367.) </p>

<p align="center"><b>Elliott(1983-1999) 897</b></p><p><b>897.</b>
The subject here being the regenerate member of the Ancient Church, 'seeing means acknowledging and possessing faith. That 'seeing' has this meaning becomes clear from the Word, as in Isaiah,  </p>
<blockquote>
You 
did not look to the Maker of it, and Him who fashioned it long ago you did not set. <a href="http://bible.gospelcom.net/cgi-bin/bible?passage=Isa%2021:11&amp;version=ESV&amp;interface=print&amp;showfn=yes&amp;showxref">Isa 21:11</a>. 
</blockquote>
<p>This refers to the city of Zion. 'Not seeing Him who fashioned it long ago' means not even acknowledging, 
let alone possessing faith. In the same prophet, </p>
<blockquote>
Make the heart of this people fat and their ears heavy, and plaster over their eyes, lest they see with their eyes and hear with their ears, and 
their heart understands and they turn again and are healed. <a href="http://bible.gospelcom.net/cgi-bin/bible?passage=Isa%206:10&amp;version=ESV&amp;interface=print&amp;showfn=yes&amp;showxref">Isa 6:10</a>. 
</blockquote>
<p>'Seeing with the eyes' stands for acknowledging and possessing faith. In the same prophet, The people walking in darkness 
have seen a great light. <a href="http://bible.gospelcom.net/cgi-bin/bible?passage=Isa%209:2&amp;version=ESV&amp;interface=print&amp;showfn=yes&amp;showxref">Isa 9:2</a>. </p>
<p>This refers to gentiles who received faith, as does the present verse which says that 'he removed the covering, and saw out'. In the same prophet, </p>
<blockquote>
On that day 
the deaf will hear the words of a book, and out of thick darkness and out of darkness the eyes of the blind will see <a href="http://bible.gospelcom.net/cgi-bin/bible?passage=Isa%2019:18&amp;version=ESV&amp;interface=print&amp;showfn=yes&amp;showxref">Isa 19:18</a>.  
</blockquote>
<p>This refers to the conversion of gentiles to faith. 'Seeing' stands 
for receiving faith. In the same prophet, </p>
<blockquote>
Hear, you deaf, look and see, you blind. <a href="http://bible.gospelcom.net/cgi-bin/bible?passage=Isa%2041:18&amp;version=ESV&amp;interface=print&amp;showfn=yes&amp;showxref">Isa 41:18</a>. 
</blockquote>
<p>Here the meaning is similar. In Ezekiel, </p>
<blockquote>
They have eyes to see but they see not; they have ears 
to hear but they hear not because they are a rebellious house. <a href="http://bible.gospelcom.net/cgi-bin/bible?passage=Ezek%2012:2&amp;version=ESV&amp;interface=print&amp;showfn=yes&amp;showxref">Ezek 12:2</a>. 
</blockquote>
<p>This stands for people who are capable of understanding, acknowledging, and possessing faith but who do not wish to. That 
'seeing' means possessing faith is quite clear from the representation of the Lord by the bronze serpent in the wilderness when everyone who beheld it would be healed, and of which it is said in Moses, 
 </p>
<blockquote>
Set a serpent on a standard, and it will happen that everyone who has been bitten, when he sees it, will live So it happened, if a serpent had bitten a man, when he saw the serpent of bronze, that 
he lived. <a href="http://bible.gospelcom.net/cgi-bin/bible?passage=Num%2021:8,%209&amp;version=ESV&amp;interface=print&amp;showfn=yes&amp;showxref">Num 21:8, 9</a>. 
</blockquote>
<p>Anyone may see from this that 'seeing' means faith, for what else can 'seeing' be in this instance than something representative of faith in the Lord? This point is clear 
also from the fact that Reuben, Jacob's firstborn, who was given that name from the word 'seeing', in the internal sense means faith. See what has been stated already about the firstborn of the Church 
in <a href="352.htm">352</a> and <a href="367.htm">367</a>. </p>

Hic quia agitur de homine Antiquae Ecclesiae regenerato, significatur per 'videre,' agnoscere et fidem habere; quod 'videre' haec (x)significet, constare potest ex Verbo; ut apud Esaiam, 	Non spectastis 
ad factorem illius, et formatorem illius e longinquo non vidistis, xxii 11; </p>
<p>de civitate Zionis; 'formatorem e longinquo non videre' est non agnoscere, minus fidem habere: apud eundem, 	Impingua 
cor populi hujus, et aures ejus aggrava, ac oculos ejus obline, ne forte videat oculis suis et auribus suis audiat, et cor ejus intelligat et convertatur, et sanetur ei, vi 10; </p>
<p>'oculis videre' pro 
agnoscere et fidem habere: apud eundem, 	Populus ambulantes in tenebris viderunt lucem magnam, ix 2; </p>
<p>de gentibus quae fidem acceperunt; similiter ac hic, 'removit tectum, et vidit': apud eundem, 	Audient 
in die illo surdi verba libri, et e caligine et e tenebris oculi caecorum videbunt, xxix 18; </p>
<p>de conversione gentium ad fidem; 'videre' pro fidem accipere: apud eundem, 	Surdi audite, et caeci 
spectate videndo, xlii 18;  similiter: apud Ezechielem, 	Quibus oculi ad videndum et non vident; quibus aures ad audiendum et non audiunt quia domus rebellionis illi, xii 2; </p>
<p>pro qui intelligere, agnoscere, 
et fidem habere possunt et non volunt.  Quod 'videre' significet fidem habere constat manifeste ex repraesentatione Domini per serpentem aeneum in deserto, quod sanarentur omnes qui viderent 
illum, de quo apud Mosen, 	Pone serpentem super signum, et fiet omnis morsus, et viderit illum, et vivet;... factum est, si momordit serpens virum, et vidit ad serpentem aeris, et vixit, Num. xxi 8, 
9; </p>
<p>ex quo quisque videre potest quod 'videre' significet fidem, nam quid ibi videre nisi repraesentativum fidei in Dominum?  Inde quoque constat quod primogenitus Jacobi, Reuben, a videndo ita vocatus, 
significet in sensu interno fidem; videantur quae prius dicta de primogenitis Ecclesiae, n. 352 et 367. </p>
