<h3 align="center" class="ired">属天的奥秘 第6690节</h3>
<h4 align="center"></h4><p><strong>6690.</strong>“神便叫她们成立家室”表它们，即属世层中真正的记忆知识，被排列成天堂的形式。这从“家”的含义清楚可知，“家”是指属世心智（<a href="4973.htm">4973</a>，<a href="5023.htm">5023</a>节），因而是指构成属世心智的事物。但由于此处所说的是收生婆，所以这些事物是属世层中真正的记忆知识（<a href="6687.htm">6687</a>节）。因此，“叫她们成立家室”表示把这些知识排列成次序；当它们被排开成天堂的形式时，就被排列成次序。人若不知道属世心智的真正记忆知识是何情形，根本不容易明白“叫她们成立家室”表示这些事。故必须简要说一说这记忆知识。属世层中的记忆知识被排列成连续的系列，一个系列连着另一个系列，它们以这种方式照着彼此间不同的关系和密切联系而都连贯在一起。它们就跟家庭及其后代一样；因为一个是从另一个而生的，它们以这种方式产生。这解释了为何心智的事物，就是良善与真理，被古人称为“家”，在那里占主导的良善被称为“父”，与该良善联结的真理被称为“母”，它们的衍生物被称为“儿子”、“女儿”、“女婿”、“儿媳”等等。但属世层中真正的记忆知识被排列的方式却因人而异，因为主导爱会在它们上面引发一种形式。这爱在中间，并将一切事物依次排列在它周围。它将最与它一致的事物放在离它自己最近的位置，然后照着一致程度而依次排列其它一切事物。记忆知识以这种方式而拥有自己的形式。如果天堂之爱占主导，那么主就会将它们都排列成天堂的形式，这个形式就像天堂的形式，因而是爱之良善本身的形式。真理便以这种形式被排列；一旦被如此排列，它们就与良善一致行动。这时，当这一个被主召唤出来时，那一个也被召唤出来；也就是说，当信之事物被召唤出来时，仁之事物也被召唤出来，反之亦然。“神便叫她们成立家室”就表示这种排列。</p>

That He made them houses. That this signifies that they, namely, the true memory-knowledges in the natural, were disposed into the heavenly form, is evident from the signification of "house," as being 
the natural mind (n. 4973, 5023), thus the things of this mind, which here, because midwives are spoken of, are true memory-knowledges in the natural (n. 6687); therefore "to make houses for them" denotes 
to dispose them into order, and they are disposed into order when they are disposed into the heavenly form. That such is the signification of "making them houses" cannot easily be known, unless 
it is known how the case is with the true memory-knowledges of the natural mind; wherefore this shall be briefly told. The memory-knowledges in the natural have been disposed into continuous series; 
one series coheres with another, and in this way they all cohere together according to various affinities and propinquities; and are circumstanced not unlike families and their generations, for one is 
born from another, and so they become productive. Hence the things of the mind, which are goods and truths, were by the ancients called "houses," the good reigning therein being named "father," and the 
truth joined to this good, "mother," and the derivations "sons," "daughters," "sons-in-law," "daughters-in-law," and so forth. But the disposition of true memory-knowledges in the natural varies with 
every man; for the ruling love induces a form on them, this love being in the midst, and setting in order everything around it. Those things which most agree with it, it sets next to itself, and everything 
else in order in accordance with their agreement. From this the memory-knowledges have their form. If heavenly love rules, then all things are disposed there by the Lord into the heavenly form, 
which form is like that of heaven, thus is the form of the good of love itself. Into this form truths are disposed, which, when so disposed, make one with good; and then when the one is called forth 
by the Lord, the other is called forth; that is to say, when the things of faith are called forth, so are those of charity, and the converse. Such is the disposition that is signified by "God made houses 
for the midwives." </p>

'That He made them houses' means that it - true factual knowledge in the natural - was arranged into a heavenly pattern. This is clear from the meaning of 'house' as the natural mind, dealt with in <a href="4973.htm">4973</a>, <a href="5023.htm">5023</a>, thus the things that compose the natural mind. But because what is said here refers to the midwives, those things are true factual knowledge in the natural, <a href="6687.htm">6687</a>. 'Making them houses' therefore 
means arranging that knowledge into order, and it is arranged into order when arranged into a heavenly pattern. It is not at all easy to see that these things are meant by 'making them houses' unless 
one knows the situation with true factual knowledge that belongs to the natural mind. Something must therefore be said briefly about this. Known facts in the natural are arranged into continuous 
series, one series tying in with another, so that they all hang together according to the varying relationships and close associations they have with one another. They are not unlike families and their 
generations; for one is born from another, and in that manner they are brought into existence. This explains why things of the mind, which are forms of good and truth, were spoken of by the ancients 
as 'houses', the form of good that ruled there being called the father, the truth linked to it the mother, and the derivations from them the sons, daughters, sons-in-law, daughters-in-law, and so on. 
But the way in which true factual knowledge in the natural is arranged varies from person to person, since the pattern it assumes is imposed on it by the ruling love. That love is at the centre and arranges 
each fact into position around it. It positions nearest to itself the facts most compatible with it, and the rest are arranged according to their degrees of compatibility. And in this way factual 
knowledge is given a pattern. If heavenly love rules, then the Lord arranges them all into a heavenly pattern, a pattern like that assumed by heaven itself, thus the pattern assumed by the good of 
love itself. Such is the pattern into which truths are arranged; and once arranged into it they act in unison with good. At this point when the one is stimulated by the Lord, so is the other; that is 
to say, when items of belief are stimulated, so are charitable desires, and vice versa. This kind of arrangement is what is meant by the statement that God made the midwives houses.  </p>

`Et fecit illis domos': quod significet quod in caelestem formam disponerentur, nempe vera scientifica in naturali, constat ex significatione `domus' quod sit mens {3} naturalis, de qua n. 4973, 5023, 
ita ea quae sunt illius mentis, quae hic, quia de obstetricibus dicitur, sunt vera scientifica (d)in naturali, n. 6687; `facere' itaque `illis domos' est disponere illa in ordinem, ac in ordinem disponuntur 
cum in formam caelestem.  Quod haec per `facere illis domos' significentur, non facile sciri potest nisi sciatur quomodo cum veris scientificis quae sunt mentis naturalis se habet; paucis itaque 
dicendum: scientifica in naturali in continuas series disposita sunt, una series cum altera, et sic omnes cohaerent secundum varias affinitates et propinquitates; seque habent non absimiliter ac familiae 
et earum generationes, nascitur enim unum ab altero, et sic {2}producuntur; inde illa quae sunt mentis, nempe bona et vera, ab antiquis dicta fuerunt `domus,' bonum ibi regnans `pater,' et verum 
illi bono {3}adjunctum `mater,' et derivationes `filii, filiae, generi, nurus,' et si porro; sed dispositio verorum scientificorum in naturali variatur apud unumquemvis hominem, formam enim illis inducit 
amor dominans; ille amor in medio est et circum se ordinat singula; sibi proxime ponit illa quae maxime conveniunt, et reliqua in ordine secundum convenientias; inde forma scientificis; si amor 
caelestis dominatur, tunc a Domino disponuntur ibi omnia in formam caelestem, quae forma est qualis est caeli, ita forma ipsius boni amoris; in hanc formam disponuntur vera quae cum ita disposita sunt, 
unum agunt cum bono; et tunc cum excitatur unum a Domino, excitatur alterum, nempe cum illa quae fidei, excitantur illa quae charitatis, et vice versa; talis dispositio est quae significatur per quod 
`Deus fecerit obstetricibus domos.' 	@1 i hominis$ 	@2 producitur$ 	@3 conjunctum$ </p>
