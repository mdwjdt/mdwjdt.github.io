<h3 align="center" class="ired">属天的奥秘 第636节</h3>
<h4 align="center"></h4><p><strong>636.</strong>“我要把他们和这地一并毁灭”表示人类和教会将一同灭亡。这一点从经文上说“和这地”清楚可知。事实上，如前所述，从广泛的意义上讲，“地”表示爱，因而表示教会的属天之物。由于此处没有任何爱，也没有任何属天之物剩下，所以“地”表示我欲（self-love），以及与教会的属天方面相反之物。尽管如此，教会成员仍存在，因为他拥有关于信的教义。如前所述，爱包含信，信包含对信仰的认知，就象地包含土地（ground），土地包含田地一样。</p>

<p><strong>[NCE]636.</strong> The meaning of I will destroy them together with the earth as the fact that the human race would meet its end when the church died can be seen from the inclusion of together with the earth in this verse. The earth or land in the broad sense symbolizes love, as already pointed out [<a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_636/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_585" target=_top>585</a>, <a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_636/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_620" target=_top>620</a>], and consequently the church's heavenly qualities. Here, since no love or any heavenly impulse remained, the earth symbolizes self-love and whatever is hostile to the church's heavenly qualities. People were still considered part of the church, though, since they held on to their religious teachings. As I said [<a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_636/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_566#subsection-2-2" target=_top>566:2</a>, <a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_636/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_620" target=_top>620</a>], the land or earth means the area surrounding the ground, and the ground means the area surrounding a field, just as love is what contains faith and faith is what contains religious knowledge. </p>
<p align="center"><b>Potts(1905-1910) 636</b></p><p><b>636.</b>
I will destroy them with the earth. That this signifies that together with the church the human race would perish, is evident from its being said "with the earth;" for the "earth" in a wide sense signifies 
love, as before said, and thus the celestial of the church. Here, since no love and nothing whatever that is celestial remained, the "earth" signifies the love of self, and whatever is contrary 
to the celestial of the church. And yet there was a man of the church, for they had doctrinal things of faith. For, as before stated, the earth is the containant of the ground, and the ground is the 
containant of the field; as love is the containant of faith, and faith is the containant of the knowledges of faith. </p>

<p align="center"><b>Elliott(1983-1999) 636</b></p><p><b>636.</b>
'I will destroy them together with the earth' means that the human race would perish together with the Church. This is clear from the fact that here the phrase 'together with the earth' is used. In fact, 
as previously stated, 'earth' in a broad sense means love and so the celestial things of the Church. Here because no love, nor anything celestial, was left it means self-love and that which is contrary 
to the celestial aspect of the Church. Despite this the member of the Church still existed because he possessed doctrinal matters concerning faith. For as has been stated, love includes faith within 
itself, and faith includes cognitions of faith, just as the earth includes the ground, and the ground includes the field. </p>

<p align="center"><b>Latin(1748-1756) 636</b>
</p><b>636.</b>
Quod 'perdam eos cum terra' significet quod genus humanum cum Ecclesia periret, constat ex eo quod hic dicatur 'cum terra'; 'terra' enim in lato sensu significat amorem, ut prius dictum, ita caelestia 
Ecclesiae; hic quia nullus amor, nec quicquam caeleste, remansit, significat amorem sui, et quod contrarium caelesti Ecclesiae est; sed usque homo Ecclesiae fuit quia doctrinalia fidei habuit: nam, 
sicut dictum, terra est continens humi, et humus continens agri, sicut amor est continens fidei, et fides continens cognitionum fidei. </p>
