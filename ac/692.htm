<h4 align="center"></h4><p><h4 align="center">七、创世记第七章</h4><br />地狱<br /><br />692．就象一个人对天堂的观念非常笼统、模糊，几近于无，他对地狱的观念同样如此。他就象住在森林中的茅屋里，只在脑子里想象茅屋外的世界，却不知它的帝国或王国，更不知它的政府形式，就别提社群或社群生活了。若不知道这些事，他们对这个世界的观念必定非常笼统，几近于无。这同样适用于世人对天堂和地狱的观念。然而，这两个地方有无数现象，比任何星球上存在的现象都要无限多。至于它们是何等数不胜数，只要想想没有哪两个人心中的天堂是一模一样的，同样也没有哪两个人心中的地狱是一模一样的，就清楚可知了。然而，自创世以来的所有灵魂都曾生活在这个世界上，他们全都去了这些地方，并聚在一起。</p>

It is like the picture of the world at large available to those who have never been outside their cabins in the forest. They know nothing about its empires and countries, let alone its forms of government, and least of all about society and the way people live in society. Until they know these things, their concept of the world cannot be more than the sketchiest notion, which is practically no notion whatever. Likewise with regard to heaven and hell. In reality, both heaven and hell contain too many marvels to count — indefinitely more than any planet could hold.<br />The vast number of wonders there can be seen from this one thought: Just as no two people ever have the same heaven, no two ever have the same hell, and all the souls that have ever existed in the world since the beginning of creation flock together there.<br /><br /><strong>Footnotes:</strong><br />{*1} For a condensed portrait of the hells, see <a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_692/swedenborg_heaven-and-hell-dole_536" target=_top>Heaven and Hell 536-588</a>.

CHAPTER 7. CONCERNING HELL. As with regard to heaven, so with regard to hell, man has only a very general idea, which is so obscure that it is almost none at all. It is such as they who have not been 
beyond their huts in the woods may have of the earth. They know nothing of its empires and kingdoms, still less of its forms of government, of its societies, or of the life in the societies. Until 
they know these things they can have but the most general notion of the earth, so general as to be almost none. The case is the same in regard to people's ideas about heaven and hell, when yet in each 
of them there are things innumerable and indefinitely more numerous than in any earthly world. How numberless they are may be evident from this alone: that just as no one ever has the same heaven, so 
no one has the same hell as another, and that all souls whatever who have lived in the world since the first creation come there and are gathered together. </p>

<p>HELL </p>
<p>Just as man's idea of heaven is very general, so hazy as to be almost none at all, so too is his idea of hell. He is like hut-dwellers in a forest who can have a mental picture of the world 
beyond, but do not know of its empires or kingdoms, still less its forms of government, and even less the communities or life of those communities. Until they know these things their idea of the 
world is bound to be very general, such as to be scarcely any at all. The same applies to man's ideas of heaven and of hell. Yet there are countless phenomena in both places, infinitely more than those 
existing on any planet. How countless they are becomes clear from the mere consideration that just as nobody ever has in mind exactly the same heaven as anybody else, so nobody ever has in mind exactly 
the same hell. And yet all souls who have ever lived in the world since creation began go to those places and are gathered together.  </p>

GENESEOS                         CAPUT SEPTIMUM                           De Inferno </p>
<p>Homo, sicut de caelo, ita de inferno, non habet ideam nisi communissimam, quae ita obscura 
est ut sit paene nulla; sicut qui non extra suas casas silvae fuerunt, ideam habere de tellure possint, et non sciunt imperia, nec regna, minus regiminis formas, et adhuc minus societates, et societatum 
vitas; antequam haec sciunt, non possunt quam in communissima idea de tellure esse, quae talis est ut fere nulla; ita de caelo et de inferno; cum tamen utrobivis innumerabilia sunt, et indefinite 
plura quam in aliquo terrarum orbe.  Quam innumerabilia sunt, exinde solum constare potest, quod sicut nusquam aliquis simile caelum habet, ita nec usquam aliquis simile infernum; et quod omnes animae, 
quaecumque in mundo fuerunt a prima creatione, illuc veniant et congregentur. </p>
