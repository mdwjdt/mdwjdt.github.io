<h3 align="center" class="ired">属天的奥秘 第1864节</h3>
<h4 align="center"></h4><p><strong>1864.</strong>“在那日，耶和华与亚伯兰立约”表主的内层人与内在人联结。这从“立约”的含义清楚可知，“立约”表结合，如前面所解释的（<a href="665.htm">665</a>，<a href="666.htm">666</a>，<a href="1023.htm">1023</a>，<a href="1038.htm">1038</a>节）。由于就内义而言，此处论述的是主，故它表示内在联结。因为主日益朝着与祂的父耶和华联结与融合发展，直到祂成为一，也就是说，祂的人性本质本身也变成耶和华，就是主的内在本身。耶和华和亚伯兰所立的约就代表这些事。谁都能明白，耶和华从不与人立约，因为这违背神性。人算什么，不就是粗鄙、龌龊之物，凭自己只会思想、行出恶事？他所行的一切善皆来自耶和华。由此可见，这约，和与亚伯兰的后代所立的其它约一样，无非代表神性和神国度的属天事物。与亚伯兰所立的约代表主的人性本质与其神性本质，即耶和华联结。它代表主的内层人与其内在人，即耶和华的联结，这从前文明显可知：主通过试探的争战和胜利日益与祂自己联结并融合。前面已阐明何为内层人，也就是说，内层人介于内在人与外在人之间。</p>

<p><strong>[NCE]1864.</strong> On that day Jehovah struck a pact with Abram symbolizes the union of the Lord's intermediate self with his inner self. This is established by the symbolism of a pact as union, which was discussed earlier, at <a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_1864/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_665" target=_top>665</a>, <a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_1864/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_666" target=_top>666</a>, <a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_1864/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_1023" target=_top>1023</a>, <a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_1864/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_1038" target=_top>1038</a>. As the subject here in an inner sense is the Lord, the pact symbolizes a deeper union. The Lord went further and further in being joined and united to Jehovah his Father until they finally became one. In other words, his human side also became Jehovah, who was the Lord's actual inner self. These things were represented by the pact that Jehovah struck with Abram.<br />Anyone can see that Jehovah never strikes a deal with us. That would go against his divine nature. What are we but some contemptible bit of filth that cannot think or do anything but evil on its own? All the good we do comes from Jehovah. The conclusion follows, then, that this pact (like other pacts with Abram's descendants) was just a representation illustrating God's nature and the heavenly features of God's kingdom. Here it represented the union of the Lord's human side with his divine side, or Jehovah.<br />Earlier discussions indicate that what this pact represented was the bonding of the Lord's intermediate self with his inner self, or Jehovah. The earlier discussions showed that the Lord was joined and united to his inner self more and more closely, through the struggles and victories of his trials [<a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_1864/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_1659#subsection-2-2" target=_top>1659:2</a>, <a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_1864/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_1661#subsection-2-5" target=_top>1661:5</a>, <a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_1864/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_1707#subsection-2-5" target=_top>1707:5</a>, <a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_1864/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_1708" target=_top>1708</a>, <a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_1864/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_1729#subsection-2-2" target=_top>1729:2</a>, <a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_1864/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_1732" target=_top>1732</a>, <a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_1864/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_1737" target=_top>1737</a>, <a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_1864/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_1738" target=_top>1738</a>, <a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_1864/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_1793" target=_top>1793:1</a>, <a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_1864/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_1815" target=_top>1815</a>].<br />His intermediate self has already been defined as the self midway between his inner and outer selves [<a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_1864/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_1701" target=_top>1701-1702</a>, <a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_1864/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_1707" target=_top>1707</a>]. </p>

In that day Jehovah made a covenant with Abram. That this signifies the conjunction of the Lord's interior man with His Internal, is evident from the signification of a "covenant," as being conjunction 
(explained before, n. 665, 666, 1023, 1038). And as the Lord is here treated of in the internal sense, it signifies interior conjunction. For the Lord advanced more and more to conjunction and union 
with Jehovah His Father, until He became One, that is, the Human Essence itself also became Jehovah, who was the Lord's Internal itself. These things were represented by the covenant which Jehovah made 
with Abram. Everyone can see that Jehovah never makes a covenant with a man, for this would be contrary to the Divine. What is a man but something vile and filthy, which of itself thinks and does 
nothing but evil? All the good that he does is from Jehovah; from which it may be seen that this covenant, like other covenants with Abram's posterity, was nothing but a representative of the Divine, 
and of the celestial things of the kingdom of God; in the present case that the covenant was representative of the conjunction of the Lord's Human Essence with His Divine Essence, that is, with Jehovah. 
That it was representative of the conjunction of the Lord's interior man with His Internal, that is, Jehovah, is evident from what has been said before, namely, that by the combats and victories of 
temptations the Lord conjoined and united Himself more and more. What His interior man was, has been told before, namely, that it was intermediate between the internal man and the external.  </p>

<p align="center"><b>Elliott(1983-1999) 1864</b></p><p><b>1864.</b>
That 'on that day Jehovah made a covenant with Abram' means the joining together of the Lord's Interior Man and His Internal Man is clear from the meaning of 'a covenant' as a joining together, dealt 
with already in <a href="665.htm">665</a>, <a href="666.htm">666</a>, <a href="1023.htm">1023</a>, <a href="1038.htm">1038</a>. Here, because in the internal sense the Lord is the subject, it means an interior conjunction. For the Lord advanced more and more towards conjunction and union 
with Jehovah His Father, till at length He became one, that is, the Human Essence itself also became Jehovah, who was the Lord's Internal itself. These things were represented by 'the covenant which Jehovah 
made with Abram'. Anyone may see that Jehovah never makes a covenant with man, for such would be contrary to the Divine. What is man but something base and filthy, which of itself thinks and does 
nothing but evil? All the good that he does comes from Jehovah. From this it becomes clear that this covenant, like every other covenant made with Abram's descendants, was nothing else than a representative 
of the Divine and of the heavenly things of the kingdom of God. This particular covenant made with Abram was a representative of the joining together of the Lord's Human Essence and His Divine 
Essence, that is, Jehovah. That it was a representative of the joining together of the Lord's Interior Man and His Internal Man, that is, Jehovah, is clear from what has gone before - that the Lord 
joined and united Himself more and more through the conflicts brought about by temptations and through victories. What the Interior Man was has been stated already, namely that which was between the 
Internal and the External. </p>

'In die illo pepigit Jehovah cum Abramo foedus': quod significet conjunctionem Interioris Hominis Domini cum Interno, constat ex significatione 'foederis' quod sit conjunctio, de qua prius n. 665, 666, 
1023, 1038; et hic quia agitur in interno sensu de Domino, significat conjunctionem interiorem; nam progressus est Dominus magis et magis ad conjunctionem et unionem cum Jehovah Patre Ipsius, usque 
dum unus factus, hoc est, ipsa Essentia Humana etiam Jehovah, Qui fuit ipsum Internum Domini; haec repraesentata sunt per 'foedus quod Jehovah pepigit cum Abramo': quisque vide potest quod Jehovah nusquam 
pangat foedus cum homine; hoc foret contra Divinum; quid homo nisi quoddam vile et spurcum, quod ex se nihil nisi quam malum cogitat et facit; omne bonum quod facit, est ex Jehovah; ex quo constare 
potest quod foedus hoc, sicut cetera foedera cum posteris Abrami, non aliud fuerit quam repraesentativum Divini et caelestium regni Dei, hic quod fuerit repraesentativum conjunctionis Humanae Essentiae 
Domini cum Ipsius Divina, hoc est, Jehovah: quod fuerit repraesentativum conjunctionis Interioris Hominis Domini cum Interno, hoc est, Jehovah, constat ex praecedentibus quod nempe Dominus per 
tentationum pugnas et victorias magis et magis se conjunxit et univit.  Quid Interior Homo, prius dictum est, nempe quod medius inter Internum et Externum. </p>
