The Internal Sense. 	 Verses 1-4. And it came to pass after these words that they sinned, the butler of the king of Egypt and the baker, to their lord the king of Egypt. And Pharaoh was wroth over 
his two court ministers, over the prince of the butlers, and over the prince of the bakers. And he put them into the custody of the house of the prince of the guards, unto the prison house, the place 
where Joseph was bound. And the prince of the guards set Joseph over them, and he ministered to them; and they were for days in custody. "And it came to pass," signifies a new state, and the things which 
follow; "after these words," signifies after the things which precede; "that they sinned," signifies inverted order; "the butler of the king of Egypt," signifies in those things in the body which 
are subject to the intellectual part; "and the baker," signifies in those things in the body which are subject to the will part; "to their lord the king of Egypt," signifies that they were contrary to 
the new state of the natural man; "and Pharaoh was wroth," signifies that the new natural man averted itself; "over his two court ministers" signifies from the sensuous things of the body of both kinds; 
"over the prince of the butlers, and over the prince of the bakers," signifies in general from the sensuous things subordinate to the intellectual part and to the will part; "and he put them into 
the custody," signifies rejection; "of the house of the prince of the guards," signifies by those things which are primary for interpretation; "unto the prison house," signifies among falsities; "the 
place where Joseph was bound," signifies the state of the celestial of the natural now as to these things; "and the prince of the guards set Joseph over them," signifies that the celestial of the natural 
taught them from things primary for interpretation; "and he ministered to them," signifies that he instructed them; "and they were for days in custody," signifies that they were long in a state of 
rejection. </p>

<p>Verses 1-4 And so it was after these words,<A name="fntext1"></a><A href="#fn1"><sup>a</sup></a> that they sinned - the cupbearer of the king of Egypt, and the baker - against their lord the king of Egypt. And Pharaoh was incensed 
with his two courtier-ministers, with the chief of the cupbearers and with the chief of the bakers. And he put them into the custody of the house of the chief of the attendants, at the prison-house, 
the place where Joseph was bound. And the chief of the attendants set Joseph over them and he ministered to them; and they were in custody for days.<A name="fntext2"></a><A href="#fn2"><sup>b</sup></a> </p>

them into the custody' means a casting aside. 'Of the house of the chief of the attendants' means the things that are first and foremost in explanations. 'At the prison-house' means among falsities. 
'The place where Joseph was bound' means the state of the celestial of the natural now in relation to these things. 'And the chief of the attendants set Joseph over them' means that under the influence 
of the things first and foremost in explanations the celestial of the natural taught those bodily senses. 'And he ministered to them' means that it instructed them. 'And they were in custody for days' 
means that they lay in a state when they were cast aside for a long time.
