<h3 align="center" class="ired">属天的奥秘 第7973节</h3>
<h4 align="center"></h4><p><strong>7973.</strong>“步行的男人约有六十万”表在一个整体中的信之真理和良善的全部事物。这从“六十万”这个数字的含义清楚可知，“六十万”是指在一个整体中的信之全部事物；因为这个数字是六的倍数，也是十二的倍数，而“十二”表示信与仁的全部事物（参看<a href="577.htm">577</a>，<a href="2089.htm">2089</a>，<a href="2129.htm">2129</a>e，<a href="2130.htm">2130</a>e，<a href="3272.htm">3272</a>，<a href="3858.htm">3858</a>，<a href="3913.htm">3913</a>节）。这就是为何雅各的儿子有十二个，他们的后代被划分为十二个支派，以及主拣选了十二门徒，也就是说，这是为了叫他们可以代表信与仁的全部事物。关于支派，可参看前文（<a href="3858.htm">3858</a>，<a href="3862.htm">3862</a>，<a href="3913.htm">3913</a>，<a href="3926.htm">3926</a>，<a href="4060.htm">4060</a>，<a href="6335.htm">6335</a>，<a href="6337.htm">6337</a>，<a href="6640.htm">6640</a>，<a href="7836.htm">7836</a>，<a href="7891.htm">7891</a>节）；关于门徒，也可参看前文（<a href="3354.htm">3354</a>，<a href="3488.htm">3488</a>，<a href="5858.htm">5858</a>e，<a href="6397.htm">6397</a>节）。<br />此处“六十万”具有相似的含义，因为一个数字，无论大小，是乘过的还是除过的，都具有和相乘或相除的简单数字相似的含义（<a href="5291.htm">5291</a>，<a href="5335.htm">5335</a>，<a href="5708.htm">5708</a>节）。这一点从数字“十二”很明显地看出来，无论这个数字是被除得6，还是被乘得72、144（也就是12乘12），12000或144000，意思是差不多，如启示录中提到的144000:<br />我听见受印的数目有十四万四千，是从以色列人各支派中受印的，每个支派有一万二千。（启示录<a href="http://39-27.cn/启7.4.htm">7:4</a>-<a href="http://39-27.cn/启7.5.htm">5</a>）<br />此处“以色列人”不是指以色列人，“支派”也不是指“支派”，“数目”不是指数目，而是指包含在内义中的那类事物，即信与仁的全部事物。每个支派相应地具体表示一个种类或一个类别，正如创世记29和30章所解释的。<br />在以下经文中同样如此：<br />我又见羔羊站在锡安山，同祂又有十四万四千人，都有祂父的名，写在额上。他们在宝座前唱新歌，除了从地上买来的那十四万四千人以外，没有人能学这歌。羔羊无论往哪里去，他们都跟随他。他们是从人间买来的，作初熟的果子归与神和羔羊。（启示录<a href="http://39-27.cn/启14.1.htm">14:1</a>，<a href="http://39-27.cn/启14.3.htm">3</a>-<a href="http://39-27.cn/启14.4.htm">4</a>）<br />从这段描述明显可知，144000表示那些处于仁的人；还明显可知，这个数字仅仅表明状态及其性质。这个数字所表明的，与“十二”所表明的很相似，因为它是“12000”和“12”的乘积。<br />在启示录，小一点的数字144也一样，这个数字是12与12的乘积：<br />他又量了由神那里从天而降的圣耶路撒冷的城墙，按着人的尺寸，就是天使的尺寸，共有一百四十四肘。（启示录<a href="http://39-27.cn/启21.2.htm">21:2</a>，<a href="http://39-27.cn/启21.17.htm">17</a>）<br />就灵义而言，“圣耶路撒冷的城墙”不是指一堵墙，而是指扞卫教会事物的信之真理（参看<a href="6419.htm">6419</a>节）也正因如此，经上说“共有一百四十四肘”。很明显，含义就是这样，因为经上说这个尺寸是“按着人的尺寸，就是天使的尺寸”，“人”和“天使”表示信之真理和良善的一切事物。<br />这一点从构成城墙根基的十二块宝石和每门都是一颗珍珠的十二个门也明显看出来（启示录<a href="http://39-27.cn/启21.19.htm">21:19</a>-<a href="http://39-27.cn/启21.21.htm">21</a>）。因为“宝石”表示源于仁之良善的信之真理（<a href="643.htm">643</a>，<a href="3720.htm">3720</a>，<a href="6426.htm">6426</a>节），“门”和“珍珠”也一样。由此明显可知，一个数字，无论大小，具有和相除或相乘的简单数字相似的含义。在圣言中，所有数字都表示真实事物参看482，487，575，647，648，755，813，1963，1988，2075，2252，3252，4264，4495，4670，5265，6175节）。<br />由此可见，从埃及出来的“六十万人”这个数字也表示这类事物。不过，几乎没有人会相信这个数字表示这类事物，因为它是一个历史事件，凡历史事件都会将心智不断锁定在外在意义中，并把它引离内在意义。尽管如此，这个数字仍表示这类属灵事物；事实上，在圣言中，没有一个音节，甚至没有一点一划本身不是神圣的，因为它含有神圣之物在里面。谁都能看出，纯历史事件没有任何神圣事物。</p>

<p align="center"><b>Potts(1905-1910) 7973</b></p><p><b>7973.</b>
About six hundred thousand on foot that were men. That this signifies all things of the truth and good of faith in one complex, is evident from the signification of the number "six hundred thousand," 
as being all things of faith in one complex; for this number arises from six and also from twelve, and "twelve" signifies all things of faith and charity (see n. 577, 2089, 2129, 2130, 3272, 3858, 3913). 
It is for this reason that the sons of Jacob were twelve, and that their posterity were distinguished into twelve tribes, and also that twelve disciples were adopted by the Lord, namely, to represent 
all things of faith and charity. (Concerning the tribes see n. 3858, 3862, 3913, 3926, 4060, 6335, 6337, 6640, 7836, 7891; concerning the disciples, n. 3354, 3488, 3858, 6397.) [2] That here "six 
hundred thousand" has a similar signification, is because a number greater or less, or multiplied, or divided, involves the like as the simple numbers from which it is derived (n. 5291, 5335, 5708). 
This is very clear from the number "twelve," which has a like signification whether divided into six, or multiplied to seventy-two, or to one hundred and forty-four-that is, twelve times twelve,-or to 
twelve thousand, or to one hundred and forty-four thousand, as the "one hundred and forty-four thousand" spoken of in John: </p>
<p>     I heard the number of the sealed, a hundred and forty and four thousand, 
sealed out of every tribe of the sons of Israel, out of each tribe twelve thousand (Rev. 7:4-5); </p>
<p>here by the "sons of Israel" are not meant the sons of Israel, nor by "tribes" tribes, nor by "number" 
number, but such things as are in the internal sense, namely, all things of faith and charity, and thus by each tribe specifically one genus or one class, according to what has been unfolded in 
regard to the contents of the twenty-ninth and thirtieth chapters of Genesis. [3] In like manner in the same: </p>
<p>     Behold the Lamb standing upon the Mount Zion, and with Him a hundred and forty and 
four thousand, having the name of His Father written upon their foreheads. They sang a new song before the throne, and no one could learn the song save the hundred and forty and four thousand bought from 
the earth. These are they who follow the Lamb whithersoever He goeth. These were bought from men, the firstfruits to God and the Lamb (Rev. 14:1, 3-4). From this description it is clear that they 
who are in charity are meant by "the hundred and forty and four thousand," and it is also clear that this number merely designates state and quality. [4] For this number designates the like as "twelve," 
because it arises from "twelve thousand" and "twelve" multiplied together; in like manner as the lesser number "one hundred and forty-four" which is twelve times twelve, in the same: </p>
<p>     He measured 
the wall of the holy Jerusalem, coming down from God out of heaven, a hundred and forty and four cubits, which is the measure of a man, that is, of an angel (Rev. 21:2, 17); </p>
<p>that in the spiritual 
sense the "wall of the holy Jerusalem" does not mean a wall, but the truth of faith defending the things of the church, see n. 6419; for which reason also it is said that it was "a hundred and forty 
and four cubits." That such is the meaning is very clear, for it is said that this measure is "the measure of a man, that is, of an angel," and by "man" and by "angel" is signified everything of the 
truth and good of faith. [5] And the same is evident from the twelve precious stones of which was the foundation of the wall, and from the twelve gates, each of which was a pearl (verses 19-21), for 
by "precious stones" are signified the truths of faith which are from the good of charity (n. 643, 3720, 6426), as likewise by a "gate" and also by a "pearl." From this then it is evident that a lesser 
and a greater number involve the like as the simple number from which they come. (That all numbers mentioned in the Word signify real things, see n. 482, 487, 575, 647, 648, 755, 813, 1963, 1988, 2075, 
2252, 3252, 4264, 4495, 4670, 5265, 6175.) [6] From all this it can now be seen that the number "six hundred thousand men" going forth out of Egypt has also such a signification. That this number 
signifies such things scarcely anyone can believe, for the reason that it is a matter of history, and everything historical keeps the mind continually in the external sense, and withdraws it from the 
internal sense. Nevertheless this number has such a signification, for there is not even a syllable, nor yet one jot or one point in the Word, which is not in itself holy, because it infolds in itself 
what is holy. Everyone sees that there is nothing holy in the mere historical fact. </p>

<p align="center"><b>Elliott(1983-1999) 7973</b></p><p><b>7973.</b>
'Around six hundred thousand men on foot' means all aspects of the truth and good of faith in their entirety. This is clear from the meaning of the number 'six hundred thousand' as all aspects of faith 
in their entirety, for this number is a multiple of six and also of twelve, and 'twelve' means all aspects of faith and charity, <a href="577.htm">577</a>, <a href="2089.htm">2089</a>, <a href="2129.htm">2129</a> (end), <a href="2130.htm">2130</a> (end), <a href="3272.htm">3272</a>, <a href="3858.htm">3858</a>, <a href="3913.htm">3913</a>. This is why Jacob's 
sons were twelve in number, why their descendants were divided into the same number of tribes, and also why the Lord chose twelve disciples, that is to say, in order that they might represent all 
aspects of faith and charity. Regarding the tribes, see <a href="3858.htm">3858</a>, <a href="3862.htm">3862</a>, <a href="3926.htm">3926</a>, <a href="3979.htm">3979</a>, <a href="4060.htm">4060</a>, <a href="6335.htm">6335</a>, <a href="6737.htm">6737</a>, <a href="6640.htm">6640</a>, <a href="7876.htm">7876</a>, <a href="7891.htm">7891</a>; and regarding the disciples, <a href="3354.htm">3354</a>, <a href="3488.htm">3488</a>, <a href="5858.htm">5858</a> (end), <a href="6397.htm">6397</a>. </p>
<p></p>
<p><b>[2]</b>
 At this point 'six 
hundred thousand' has a similar meaning because a larger or smaller number that is a multiple or a factor carries a meaning similar to that of the simple numbers that are being multiplied or divided, <a href="5291.htm">5291</a>, <a href="5335.htm">5335</a>, <a href="5708.htm">5708</a>. This is plainly evident from the number twelve. Whether this is divided into six or multiplied into seventy-two, 144 (which is twelve twelves), 12000, or 144000, the meaning is similar, 
as with 144000 in John, </p>
<blockquote>
I heard the number of the sealed, a hundred and forty-four thousand, sealed out of every tribe of Israel - out of each tribe twelve thousand. <a href="http://bible.gospelcom.net/cgi-bin/bible?passage=Rev%207:4,%205&amp;version=ESV&amp;interface=print&amp;showfn=yes&amp;showxref">Rev 7:4, 5</a> 
</blockquote>
and following 
verses. </p>
<p>Here 'the children of Israel' is not used to mean the children of Israel, 'tribes' the tribes, or 'the number' a number, but to mean the kinds of things contained in the internal sense, namely 
all aspects of faith and charity. Each tribe in particular accordingly means one kind or one group, in keeping with the explanations at Genesis <a href="29.htm">29</a> and <a href="30.htm">30</a>. </p>
<p></p>
<p><b>[3]</b>
 Similarly with the following in the 
same author, </p>
<p>Behold, a Lamb standing on Mount Zion, and with Him 144000, having His Father's name written on their foreheads. They were singing a new song before the throne, and no one could learn 
the song except 144000 bought from the earth. These are the ones who follow the Lamb wherever He goes. These were bought from men (homo), being the first fruits to God and the Lamb. <a href="http://bible.gospelcom.net/cgi-bin/bible?passage=Rev%2014:1,%203,%204&amp;version=ESV&amp;interface=print&amp;showfn=yes&amp;showxref">Rev 14:1, 3, 4</a>. </p>
<p>From 
this description it is evident that those governed by charity are meant by 144000. It is also evident that the sole purpose of this number is to indicate the state and its essential nature. 
That number is similar to twelve in what it indicates, for it is the product of 12000 and it multiplied. </p>
<p></p>
<p><b>[4]</b>
 It is similar with the smaller number 144, Which is twelve times twelve, in the same author, </p>
<p>He 
measured the wall of the holy Jerusalem coming down from God out of heaven, 144 cubits, which is the measure of a man (homo), that is, of an angel. <a href="http://bible.gospelcom.net/cgi-bin/bible?passage=Rev%2021:2,%2017&amp;version=ESV&amp;interface=print&amp;showfn=yes&amp;showxref">Rev 21:2, 17</a>. </p>
<p>'The wall of the holy Jerusalem' 
is not in the spiritual sense a wall; instead it is the truth of faith defending things of the Church, see <a href="6419.htm">6419</a>; and this also is why it is said to have been '144 cubits'. It is plainly evident 
that such must be meant, since it says 'it is the measure of a man, that is, of an angel'. 'Man' and 'angel' mean every aspect of the truth and good of faith. </p>
<p></p>
<p><b>[5]</b>
 The same is also evident from 
the twelve precious stones that the foundation of the wall consisted of, and from the twelve gates, each of which was a pearl, <a href="http://bible.gospelcom.net/cgi-bin/bible?passage=Rev%2021:19-21&amp;version=ESV&amp;interface=print&amp;showfn=yes&amp;showxref">Rev 21:19-21</a>. For by 'precious stones' truths of faith that spring from 
the good of charity are meant, <a href="643.htm">643</a>, <a href="3720.htm">3720</a>, <a href="6426.htm">6426</a>, and similarly by 'gate' and also by 'pearl'. From this it is now clear that a smaller or larger number carries a meaning similar to the simple number that 
is divided or multiplied. As regards the fact that all numbers in the Word mean spiritual things, see <a href="481.htm">481</a>, <a href="487.htm">487</a>, <a href="575.htm">575</a>, <a href="647.htm">647</a>, <a href="648.htm">648</a>, <a href="755.htm">755</a>, <a href="813.htm">813</a>, <a href="1963.htm">1963</a>, <a href="1988.htm">1988</a>, <a href="2075.htm">2075</a>, <a href="2252.htm">2252</a>, <a href="3252.htm">3252</a>, <a href="4164.htm">4164</a>, <a href="4495.htm">4495</a>, <a href="4670.htm">4670</a>, <a href="5265.htm">5265</a>. </p>
<p></p>
<p><b>[6]</b>
From these considerations one may now see that the number 'six hundred thousand' men going out of Egypt also means such things. But scarcely anyone is able to believe that such are meant by this number 
because it refers to a historical event; and any historical event fixes the mind all the time on the external sense and draws it away from the internal sense. Nevertheless that number too means such 
spiritual things, for there is not a part of a word, not even indeed one jot or one tittle in the Word, that is not in itself holy, because it holds what is holy within it. Anyone at all can see that 
there is nothing holy about a merely historical event. </p>

Quasi sescenta milia peditum virorum': quod significet omnia veri et boni fidei in uno complexu, constat ex significatione numeri `sescentorum milium' quod sint omnia fidei in uno complexu, exsurgit 
enim hic numerus ex sex et quoque ex duodecim, et duodecim significant omnia fidei et charitatis, n. 577, 2089, 2129 fin., 2130 fin., 3272, 3858, 3913; inde est quod filii {1}Jacobi fuerint duodecim, 
et quod posteri illorum distincti in totidem tribus, et quoque quod a Domino assumpti sint duodecim discipuli, ut nempe {2}repraesentarent omnia fidei et charitatis; de tribubus, videatur n. 3858, 3862, 
(x)3926, 3939, 4060, 6335, 6337, 6640, 7836, 7891; de discipulis, n. 3354, 3488, 5858 fin., 6397; quod hic `sescenta milia' significent similia, 2 est quia numerus major et minor, seu multiplicatus 
ac divisus, simile {3}involvit cum simplicibus ex quibus, n. 5291, 5335, (x)5708; hoc patet manifeste ex numero duodecim, hic sive divisus sit in sex, vel multiplicatus in septuaginta duo, vel in 144, 
hoc est, duodecim in duodecim, vel in 12000, vel in 144000, simile significat, ut 144000 apud Johannem, Audivi numerum obsignatorum centum quadraginta quattuor milia, obsignati ex omni tribu Israelis; 
ex tribu unaquavis duodecim milia, Apoc. vii 4, 5, seq.; </p>
<p>hic per `filios Israelis' non intelliguntur filii Israelis, {4} non per `tribus' tribus, nec per `numerum' numerus, sed talia quae sunt in 
sensu interno, {5}nempe omnia fidei et charitatis, {6}et sic per unamquamvis tribum in specie, unum genus vel una classis, secundum illa quae ad Gen. xxix et xxx explicata sunt: similiter apud eundem, 
3 Ecce Agnus stans super monte Sionis, et cum Ipso 144000 habentia nomen Patris Ipsius scriptum super frontibus suis; canebant canticum novum coram throno, et nemo poterat discere canticum nisi 144000 
empti de terra; hi sunt qui sequuntur Agnum quo vadit; hi empti sunt de hominibus, primitiae Deo et Agno, xiv 1, 3, 4; </p>
<p>ex hac descriptione patet quod qui in {7} charitate sunt intelligantur per 
144000; et quoque patet quod numerus ille modo designet statum et quale; numerus enim ille designat simile cum duodecim, nam existit ex 12000 {8}et 12 in se multiplicatis: similiter ac numerus minor 144, 
qui est duodecies duodecim, apud eundem, 4 Mensus est murum sanctae Hierosolymae descendentis a Deo e caelo, 144 cubitorum, quae est mensura hominis, hoc est, angeli, Apoc. xxi 2, 17; </p>
<p>quod `murus 
sanctae Hierosolymae' non sit murus in sensu spirituali sed quod sit verum fidei defendens illa quae Ecclesiae, videatur n. 6419; inde quoque dicitur fuisse illum `144 cubitorum'; quod ita sit, manifeste 
patet, nam dicitur quod `mensura illa sit hominis, hoc est, angeli'; per `hominem' et per `angelum' significatur omne veri et boni fidei; 5 et quoque patet ex duodecim lapidibus pretiosis ex quibus 
fundamentum muri, et ex duodecim portis, quarum unaquaevis erat margarita, ibid. vers. 19-21; per `lapides' enim `pretiosos' significantur vera fidei quae ex bono charitatis, n. 643, 3720, 6426; similiter

etiam talia; quod hic numerus talia significet, vix aliquis credere potest ex causa quia historicum est, ac omne historicum mentem in sensu externo continenter tenet et a sensu interno abstrahit;
