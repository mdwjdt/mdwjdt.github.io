<h4 align="center"></h4><p><strong>259.</strong>对于“脚跟”表尘世或肉体的底层，这只有先了解上古之人看待人的方式才能知晓。上古之人将人的属天层和属灵层指向头和面，将从两者所出的，如仁慈和怜悯，指向胸，将属世层指向脚，将其中更低者指向脚掌，将尘世和肉体的底层指向脚跟，不仅指向而已，更如此相称。<br />“脚跟”也象征理性的底层，亦即知识，如雅各论但的预言：“但必作道上的蛇，路中的虺，咬伤马蹄，使骑马的坠落于后。”（创世记<a href="http://39-27.cn/创49.17.htm">49:17</a>）又如：“奸恶随我脚跟，四面环绕我。”（诗篇<a href="http://39-27.cn/诗49.5.htm">49:5</a>）<br />类似地，当雅各出生时，他的手抓住以扫的脚跟，遂被称为“雅各”（创世记<a href="http://39-27.cn/创25.26.htm">25:26</a>）。“雅各”一名出自“脚跟”，因为“雅各”所象征的犹太教，要伤（蛇的）脚跟。<br />蛇只能伤属世层的底层，除非是某种毒蛇，否则伤不了属世层的内里，更伤不了属灵层和属天层。在人不知不觉中，主将这些保守并保存起来。在圣经中，主所保存起来的被称为“余留”。因主的慈悲，后面我会解释洪水前的人是如何因为感官、我欲，犹太人是如何因为感官、传统、繁文缛节、我欲物欲，现代人是如何因为感官、知识、哲学、我欲物欲，而被蛇伤了属世层的底层的。</p>

<p><strong>[NCE]259.</strong> The meaning of the heel as what is bottommost on the earthly level, or the bodily dimension, cannot be known without information on the way the earliest people viewed the various levels inside us. They connected heavenly and spiritual qualities in us with the head and face. They connected the effects of those qualities — charity and mercy, for instance — with the chest. Things on the earthly level they connected with the lower leg. Those that rank fairly low they associated with the foot, and the very lowest earthly and bodily concerns, with the heel. In addition, not only did they connect such attributes with those body parts, they even called them by those names.<br />The heel also means the bottommost things in the rational mind, which are the facts we know. They are involved in Jacob's prophecy concerning Dan:<br />Dan will be a snake on the path, an asp on the track, biting the horse's heels, and its rider falls off behind. (<a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_259/bible_king-james-version_genesis_49_17" target=_top>Genesis 49:17</a>)<br />They are also meant in David:<br />The wickedness at my heels has surrounded me. (<a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_259/bible_king-james-version_psalms_49_5" target=_top>Psalms 49:5</a>)<br /><a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_259/bible_king-james-version_genesis_25_26" target=_top>Genesis 25:26</a> says that when Jacob came out of the womb, he was grasping Esau's heel (which is why he was called Jacob) and the meaning here is the same. The name Jacob comes from [the Hebrew word for] "heel" because the Jewish church, symbolized by Jacob, was to wound the heel.{*1} [2] Snakes are able to hurt only the lowest things on the earthly plane. Unless they are a species of viper, they cannot harm the more interior things we have on the earthly plane, still less those on the spiritual plane, least of all those on the heavenly plane. All these things the Lord protects, and he stores them away without our awareness. (What the Lord stores away is called "a remnant" [or "survivors"] in the Word.){*2} The pages to come, though, by the Lord's divine mercy, will reveal how the snake destroyed those lowest things in pre-Flood people through a focus on the senses and through self-love.{*3} They will show how the snake destroyed them among Jews through a concern with sensory experiences, tradition, and trivialities, and through self-love and materialism.{*4} Then they will show how the snake has destroyed and is destroying people at the present day through sensory, scientific, and philosophical matters, and once more through self-love and materialism.{*5} <br /><strong>Footnotes:</strong><br />{*1} The Hebrew root of the name Jacob is עָקֵב (‘āqēḇ), or "heel." The verb עָקַב (‘āqaḇ), which has the same root, means "to follow at the heel," thus, figuratively, to assail in a furtive way, or per Swedenborg's reading at <a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_259/bible_king-james-version_genesis_27_36" target=_top>Genesis 27:36</a>, to supplant. The latter passage is a good example of how Hebrew plays on the literal and figurative meanings in its account of Jacob. [RS] In saying that the Jewish church was to wound the heel, Swedenborg is doubtless referring to the betrayal of Jesus by Judas, who also, like Jacob, was seen by Swedenborg as representing the Jewish church (see <a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_259/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_4751" target=_top>Secrets of Heaven 4751</a>; <a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_259/swedenborg_doctrine-of-the-lord-rogers_16" target=_top>The Lord 16</a>; <a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_259/swedenborg_true-christian-religion-chadwick_130" target=_top>True Christianity 130</a>). [LHC]<br />{*2} On the concept of the remnant in the Bible, see note 1 in <a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_259/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_8" target=_top>8</a>. [LHC]<br />{*3} Throughout his treatment of <a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_259/bible_king-james-version_genesis_6_1-22" target=_top>Genesis 6</a> (<a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_259/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_554" target=_top>554-683</a>) Swedenborg describes how self-love corrupted the desires and thoughts of people living just before the Flood. [LHC]<br />{*4} Swedenborg's attitude toward Jews echoes much of the Christian tradition. On the one hand, Jews are the preservers of the true religion handed down from the most ancient church; on the other hand, the Jewish religion is assailed for its degeneracy, corruption, and literalism. The tensions and ambiguities reflected in this attitude go back to the New Testament. The Gospel of John, for example, states that "salvation is of the Jews" (<a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_259/bible_king-james-version_john_4_22" target=_top>John 4:22</a>), but the Gospel also stresses the role of "the Jews" as Christ's enemies and persecutors (see, for example, <a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_259/bible_king-james-version_john_7_1" target=_top>John 7:1</a>; <a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_259/bible_king-james-version_john_19_31" target=_top>19:31</a>). Modern scholars tend to see these views as reflections not of Christ's actual teachings, but of tensions between the Jewish synagogue and the nascent Christian community in the late first century c.e. (for one example, see Schmithals 1997, 258-277). See also the reader's guide, pages 51-55 [NCBSP: Available from Swedenborg Foundation], which cites several passages pertinent to Swedenborg's statement here in <a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_259/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_259#subsection-2-2" target=_top>259:2</a>. [RS] The "pages to come" to which Swedenborg is referring here may include such passages as <a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_259/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_1094" target=_top>1094</a>, <a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_259/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_1200" target=_top>1200</a>, <a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_259/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_1205" target=_top>1205</a>. [LHC]<br />{*5} Swedenborg describes the harmful effect of over-reliance on sensory evidence and logic in such passages as <a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_259/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_1072" target=_top>1072</a>, <a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_259/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_2568" target=_top>2568</a>, <a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_259/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_2588" target=_top>2588</a>, <a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_259/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_4658" target=_top>4658</a>.

That by the "heel" is meant the lowest natural or corporeal cannot be known unless the way in which the most ancient people considered the various things in man is known. They referred his celestial 
and spiritual things to the head and face; what comes forth from these (as charity and mercy), to the chest natural things, to the feet; lower natural things, to the soles of the feet; and the lowest 
natural and corporeal things, to the heel; nor did they merely refer to them, but also so called them. The lowest things of reason, that is, memory-knowledges [scientifica], were also meant by what Jacob 
prophesied concerning Dan: </p>
<p>     Dan shall be a serpent upon the way, an adder upon the path, biting the horse's heels, and his rider falls backward (Gen. 49:17). Also in David: </p>
<p>     The iniquity 
of my heels hath compassed me about (Ps. 49:5). In like manner by what is related of Jacob, when he came forth from the womb,      That his hand laid hold of Esau's heel, whence he was called Jacob 
(Gen. 25:26),for the name "Jacob" comes from the "heel" because the Jewish Church, signified by "Jacob" injured the heel. A serpent can injure only the lowest natural things, but unless it is a species 
of viper, not the interior natural things in man, still less his spiritual things, and least of all his celestial things, which the Lord preserves and stores up in man without his knowledge. What 
are thus stored up by the Lord are called in the Word "remains." The mode in which the serpent destroyed those lowest natural things in the people before the flood, by the sensuous principle and the love 
of self; and among the Jews, by sensuous things, traditions, trifles, and by the love of self and of the world; and how at this day he has destroyed and continues to destroy them by the things of 
sense, of memory-knowledge, and of philosophy, and at the same time by the same loves, shall of the Lord's Divine mercy be told hereafter. </p>

'The heel' is used to mean the lowest part of the natural, which is the bodily. This cannot be known unless one knows how the most ancient people looked on the things that are in man. Celestial and spiritual 
things within him they associated with the head and face. The things that sprang from these, such as charity and mercy, they associated with the breast. Natural things however they associated 
with the foot, lower natural things with the sole of the foot, and the lowest natural and bodily with the heel. Not only did they associate things within man with parts of the body, they also called 
them such. The lowest things of reason, namely facts, were also meant by what Jacob prophesied concerning Dan,   Dan will be a serpent on the road, an asp on the path, biting the horse's heels; and 
its rider falls backwards. <a href="http://bible.gospelcom.net/cgi-bin/bible?passage=Gen%2049:17&amp;version=ESV&amp;interface=print&amp;showfn=yes&amp;showxref">Gen 49:17</a>. </p>
<p>And the statement in David,  </p>
<blockquote>
The iniquity of my heels has surrounded me. <a href="http://bible.gospelcom.net/cgi-bin/bible?passage=Ps%2049:5&amp;version=ESV&amp;interface=print&amp;showfn=yes&amp;showxref">Ps 49:5</a>.  
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
A similar statement is made in reference to Jacob whose hand, as he 
was being born, was grasping Esau's heel, which was why he was called Jacob, <a href="http://bible.gospelcom.net/cgi-bin/bible?passage=Gen%2025:26&amp;version=ESV&amp;interface=print&amp;showfn=yes&amp;showxref">Gen 25:26</a>. 
</blockquote>
The name Jacob derives from the word for a heel, for the Jewish Church, meant by Jacob, was to bruise the heel.

 The serpent is capable of harming only the lowest natural things in man, but not, unless they are types of vipers, the interior natural, still less the spiritual, and least of all the celestial. 
These the Lord preserves, and stores away in man without his awareness. The things which the Lord stores away are in the Word called 'remnants'. But how the serpent through sensory-mindedness and 
self-love destroyed those lowest things with people before the Flood; how it destroyed them with the Jews by means of sensory judgements, traditions, and things of no importance, as well as by self-love 
and love of the world; and how today it is destroying them and has destroyed them by means of sensory judgements, material facts, and philosophical arguments, along with the same self-love and love 
of the world, will in the Lord's Divine mercy be discussed later on.  </p>

Quod per 'calcaneum' intelligatur infimum naturale seu corporeum, non sciri potest nisi sciatur quomodo antiquissimi considerarunt ea quae sunt in homine. Caelestia et spiritualia ejus referebant ad 
caput et faciem; quae ex illis existebant, ut charitas et misericordia, ad pectus; naturalia autem ad pedem, inferiora naturalia ad plantam; infima naturalia et corporea ad calcaneum; nec solum referebant 
ad ea, sed etiam ita vocabant. Infima rationis seu scientifica quoque intellecta sunt, [per] quae de Dane prophetavit Jacob, 	Erit Dan serpens super via, aspis super semita, mordens calcaneos equi, 
et cadit eques ejus retrorsum, Gen. xlix 17: </p>
<p>et quae apud Davidem, 	Iniquitas calcaneorum meorum circumdedit me, Ps. xlix 6 [A.V. 5]: </p>

<p>nomen Jacobi est ex calcaneo, quia Ecclesia Judaica, per 'Jacobum' significata, laederet calcaneum.  [2] Serpens modo laedere potest 
naturalia infima, non autem, nisi sint species viperae, naturalia interiora in homine, minus adhuc spiritualia, et minime caelestia; illa Dominus conservat, et homine nesciente recondit; quae Dominus 
recondit, vocantur in Verbo 'reliquiae.' Quomodo autem serpens destruxerit infima ista apud antediluvianos per sensuale et amorem sui; et quomodo destruxerit apud Judaeos per sensualia, traditiones 
et nugas, perque amorem sui et mundi; et quomodo hodie destruit, et destruxit, per sensualia, scientifica et philosophica, et simul per eosdem amores, in sequentibus, ex Divina Domini Misericordia,
