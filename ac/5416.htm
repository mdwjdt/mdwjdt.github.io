<h4 align="center"></h4><p><strong>5416.</strong>创世记42:6-8.当时约瑟是在这地的官长；卖给那地众民的就是他。约瑟的哥哥们来了，脸伏于地，向他下拜。约瑟看见他哥哥们，就认得他们，却向他们装作生人，向他们说些严厉话，问他们说，你们从哪里来？他们说，从迦南地来买粮。约瑟认得他哥哥们，他们却不认得他。<br />“当时约瑟是在这地的官长”表这属灵层的属天层，或源于神性的真理在记忆知识所在的属世层中掌权。“卖给那地众民的就是他”表一切的交与皆由此而来。“约瑟的哥哥们来了”表没有任何居间物的教会的总体真理。“脸伏于地，向他下拜”表谦卑。“约瑟看见他哥哥们，就认得他们”表出于属灵层的属天层的觉知和认出。“却向他们装作生人”表因没有居间物而没有联结。“向他们说些严厉话”表因此，双方没有一致性。“问他们说，你们从哪里来”表调查。“他们说，从迦南地来”表来自教会，或它们属于教会。“买粮”表将良善的真理变成它们自己的。“约瑟认得他哥哥们”表属灵层的属天层凭它的光看见教会的这些真理。“他们却不认得他”表源于神性的这真理在尚未被天堂之光光照的属世之光中是看不见的。</p>

Verses 6-8. And Joseph he was the governor over the land; he it was that sold to all the people of the land; and Joseph's brethren came, and bowed down themselves to him with their faces to the earth. 
And Joseph saw his brethren, and he knew them, but made himself strange unto them, and spoke hard things with them; and he said unto them, Whence came ye? And they said, From the land of Canaan to buy 
food. And Joseph knew his brethren, but they knew not him. "And Joseph he was the governor over the land," signifies that the celestial of the spiritual, or truth from the Divine, reigned in the natural 
where memory-knowledges were; "he it was that sold to all the people of the land," signifies that from this was all appropriation; "and Joseph's brethren came," signifies the general truths of the 
church without mediation; "and bowed down themselves to him with their faces to the earth," signifies humiliation; "and Joseph saw his brethren, and he knew them," signifies perception and acknowledgment 
by the celestial of the spiritual; "but made himself strange unto them," signifies non-conjunction because without an intermediate; "and spoke hard things with them," signifies hence also non-correspondence; 
"and he said unto them, Whence came ye?" signifies exploration; "and they said, From the land of Canaan," signifies that they were of the church; "to buy food," signifies to appropriate 
the truth of good; "and Joseph knew his brethren," signifies that these truths of the church appeared to the celestial of the spiritual from its light; "but they knew not him," signifies that truth from 
the Divine did not appear in natural light not yet illumined by heavenly light. </p>

Verses 6-8 And Joseph, he was the governor over the land, he was selling to all the people of the land. And Joseph's brothers came and bowed down to him, faces to the earth. And Joseph saw his brothers, 
and recognized them; and he acted as a stranger to them, and spoke hard words to them, and said to them, Where have you come from? And they said, From the land of Canaan, to buy food. And Joseph recognized 
his brothers, and they did not recognize him. </p>
<p>'And Joseph, he was the governor over the land' means that the celestial of the spiritual, or truth from the Divine, reigned in the natural where 
factual knowledge resided. 'He was selling to all the people of the land' means that this was what effected every making over. 'And Joseph's brothers came' means general truths known to the Church 
which were without any intermediary. 'And bowed down to him, faces to the earth' means an expression of humility. 'And Joseph saw his brothers, and recognized them' means perception and recognition 
by the celestial of the spiritual. 'And he acted as a stranger to them' means that in the absence of the intermediary no joining together took place. 'And spoke hard words to them' means no agreement 
therefore existed either. 'And said to them, Where have you come from?' means an investigation. 'And they said, From the land of Canaan' means from the Church. 'To buy food' means to make the truth of 
good their own. 'And Joseph recognized his brothers' means that the truths of the Church were visible to the celestial of the spiritual in the light that this possessed. 'And they did not recognize him' 
means that truth from the Divine was not seen in natural light that was not yet brightened with heavenly light. </p>

Vers. 6-8.  Et Joseph is dominator super terram, is vendens omni populo terrae; et venerunt fratres Josephi, et incurvarunt se ei facies ad terram. Et vidit Joseph fratres suos, et agnovit illos, et 
gessit se alienum ad illos, et locutus cum illis aura, et dixit ad illos, Unde venistis? et dixerunt, E terra Canaan, ad emendum cibum. Et agnovit Joseph fratres suos, et illi non agnoverunt eum. `Et 
Joseph is dominator super terram' significat quod caeleste spiritualis seu verum a Divino regnaret in naturali ubi scientifica: `is vendens omni populo terrae' significat quod ex illo omnis appropriatio: 
`et venerunt fratres Josephi' significat communia vera Ecclesiae absque mediatione: `et incurvarunt se ei facies ad terram' significat humiliationem: `et vidit Joseph fratres suos et agnovit illos' 
significat perceptionem et agnitionem a caelesti spiritualis: `et gessit se alienum ad illos' significat non conjunctionem quia absque medio: `et locutus cum illis dura' significat inde quoque non 
correspondentiam: `et dixit ad illos, Unde venistis' significat explorationem: `et dixerunt, E terra Canaan' significat quod ab Ecclesia: `ad emendum cibum' significat ad appropriandum verum boni: `et 
agnovit Joseph fratres suos' significat quod vera illa Ecclesiae caelesti spiritualis ex luce ejus apparerent: `et illi non agnoverunt eum' significat quod verum a Divino non appareret in luce naturali 
nondum a luce caelesti illuminata. </p>
