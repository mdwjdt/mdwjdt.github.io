<h3 align="center" class="ired">属天的奥秘 第6145节</h3>
<h4 align="center"></h4><p><strong>6145.</strong>“那地就都归了法老”表一切事物都服从属世层，而属世层在内在掌控之下。这从“那地归了法老”的含义和“法老”的代表清楚可知：“那地归了法老”是指将“地”所表示的一切事物都变成它自己的，并使它们服务它自己；“法老”是指总体的属世层（参看<a href="5160.htm">5160</a>，<a href="5799.htm">5799</a>，<a href="6015.htm">6015</a>节），“埃及”所表示的记忆知识被聚集到属世层（<a href="6115.htm">6115</a>节）。该属世层之所以在内在掌控之下，是因为整个属世层，无论总体上还是每个部分，都在内在掌控之下。约瑟作了治理全埃及地的主，以及他负责掌管法老的家（创世记<a href="http://39-27.cn/创41.40.htm">41:40</a>-<a href="http://39-27.cn/创41.43.htm">43</a>，以及四十五章）就表示在内在掌控之下；在那里，经上说：<br />约瑟对他弟兄们说，差我到这里来的乃是神。祂又使我作他全家的主；我已在埃及全地掌权。（创世记<a href="http://39-27.cn/创45.3.htm">45:3</a>，<a href="http://39-27.cn/创45.8.htm">8</a>）<br />这解释了为何论到属世层，就说它在内在的掌控之下。</p>

And the land was Pharaoh's. That this signifies that all things were subjected to the natural that was under the auspices of the internal, is evident from the signification of "the land was Pharaoh's," 
as being the appropriation and subjection of all things which are signified by the "land;" and from the representation of Pharaoh, as being the natural in general (see n. 5160, 5799, 6015), into which 
were brought the memory-knowledges which are signified by "Egypt" (n. 6115). That it is under the auspices of the internal, is because the whole natural, both in general and in part, as being under 
the auspices of the internal, is signified by Joseph's being ruler over all the land of Egypt, and also by his being set over Pharaoh's house (Gen. 41:40-43), as we read: </p>
<p>     Joseph said unto his 
brethren, God hath set me for a father to Pharaoh, and for a lord to all his house, and I rule in all the land of Egypt (Gen. 45:3, 8). This is the reason why it is said of the natural that it is under 
the auspices of the internal. </p>

<p align="center"><b>Elliott(1983-1999) 6145</b></p><p><b>6145.</b>
'And the land was Pharaoh's' means that all things were made subject to the natural, which was under the control of the internal. This is clear from the meaning of 'the land was his' as the making its 
own of all things, meant by 'the land', and the subjection of them to itself; and from the representation of 'Pharaoh' as the natural in general, dealt with in <a href="5160.htm">5160</a>, <a href="5799.htm">5799</a>, <a href="6015.htm">6015</a>, into which factual knowledge, 
meant by 'Egypt', was gathered, <a href="6115.htm">6115</a>. The reason this was under the control of the internal is that the entire natural, both in general and in every part, was under it. Being under the control 
of the internal is meant by Joseph's being lord over all the land of Egypt, and also by his having been placed in charge over Pharaoh's house, Gen.41:40-43; also Chapter <a href="45.htm">45</a> where it says,  </p>
<blockquote>
Joseph 
said to his brothers, God has established me as father to Pharaoh, and lord for all his house; and I have dominion in all the land of Egypt. <a href="http://bible.gospelcom.net/cgi-bin/bible?passage=Gen%2045:8&amp;version=ESV&amp;interface=print&amp;showfn=yes&amp;showxref">Gen 45:8</a>. 
</blockquote>
<p>This now explains why it is said of the natural 
that it was under the control of the internal. </p>

</p><b>6145.</b>
`Et fuit terra Pharaoni':  quod significet quod subjecta omnia naturali quod sub auspicio interni, constat ex significatione `fuit terra illi' quod sit appropriatio et subjectio omnium quae per `terram' 
significantur; et ex repraesentatione `Pharaonis' quod sit  naturale in communi, de qua n. (x)5160, 5799,6015, ad quod scientifica quae per `Aegyptum' significantur, collata sunt, n. 6115; quod sub 
 auspicio interni, est quia totum naturale tam in communi quam in parte; quod sub auspicio interni sit, significatur per quod `Joseph dominans fuerit super omnem terram Aegypti', et quoque quod  `praefectus 
super domum Pharaonis', Gen. xli 40-43; et xlv, ubi haec: </p>
<p>Dixit Joseph ad fratres suos, Deus posuit me ad patrem  Pharaoni, et ad dominum omni domui suae, et dominor in omni  terra Aegypti, 
vers. 8;   inde nunc est quod de naturali dicatur quod sub auspicio interni.   </p>
