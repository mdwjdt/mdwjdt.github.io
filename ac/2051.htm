<h3 align="center" class="ired">属天的奥秘 第2051节</h3>
<h4 align="center"></h4><p><strong>2051.</strong>“都必须受割礼”表他们，就是“家里生的”和“用银子买的”所表示的教会中人必须完全除去自己的我欲和物欲。这从“割礼”的代表物清楚可知，“割礼”是指从我欲和物欲中洁净（参看<a href="2039.htm">2039</a>节）。此处再次要求他们受割礼，故经上公开声明“必须受割礼”，以此表达完全从这些爱欲中洁净的必要性。此处是指那些教会中人，故未提及“外人”，因为后者（如前所示，<a href="2049.htm">2049</a>节）是指那些教会外的人。<br />从对前一节有关“家里生的”和“用银子买的”内容的这种重复，谁都能看出有一个从字面看不出来的神性奥秘存在。这个奥秘就是，在教会中，从这些污秽的爱中洁净是最为必要的，因为教会中人能使神圣事物变得不洁，而这是教会外的人，即外邦人无法做到的，所以前者面临罚入地狱的危险更大。而且，教会中人能形成并吸收违背信之真理本身的错误假设，这也是教会外的人所无法做到的，因为他们对这些真理一无所知。因此，前者能亵渎神性真理，而后者则不能。有关这些问题的更多内容，可参看第一卷（<a href="1059.htm">1059</a>，<a href="1327.htm">1327</a>，<a href="1328.htm">1328</a>节）。</p>

Circumcising he shall be circumcised. That this signifies that they must wholly remove from themselves the loves of self and of the world, that is, that they must do this who are within the church and 
who are signified by him "that is born in the house," and by him "that is bought with silver," is evident from the representation of circumcision," as being purification from the loves of self and of 
the world (see above, n. 2039). It is here repeated that they are to be circumcised, and it is said, "circumcising he shall be circumcised," by which is expressed the necessity, that is, for their being 
wholly purified from those loves. And as those are signified who are within the church, the "sons that are strangers" are not mentioned here, because by them (as shown above, n. 2049) are signified 
those who are outside the church.  [2] From the repetition of what was said in the preceding verse concerning those born in the house and those bought with silver, everyone can see that there is a 
Divine arcanum which is not seen from the sense of the letter. The arcanum is, that purification from those filthy loves is necessary most of all within the church, and this for the reason that they 
who are within the church are able to render holy things themselves impure, which they who are outside the church-that is, the Gentiles cannot do; so that the danger of damnation is greater in the case 
of the former. Moreover those who are within the church are able to form principles of falsity contrary to the very truths of faith, and to become imbued with them; whereas those who are outside the 
church cannot do this, because they are ignorant of these truths. Thus the former can profane holy truths, but not the latter (concerning which more may be seen in Part First, n. 1059, 1327, 1328). </p>

That 'he must be circumcised'<A name="fntext1"></a><A href="#fn1"><sup>a</sup></a> means that they, namely those inside the Church meant by him 'born in the house' and him 'bought with silver', must completely remove from themselves self-love and love 
of the world is clear from the representation of 'circumcision' as purification from self-love and love of the world, dealt with above in <a href="2039.htm">2039</a>. Here the requirement for them to be circumcised is repeated 
in the commend 'he must be circumcised!' which expresses the necessity for them to be purified completely from those loves. And because it means those who are inside the Church no reference is made 
here to sons who are foreigners, for the latter, as shown above in <a href="2049.htm">2049</a>, mean those outside the Church. </p>
<p></p>
<p><b>[2]</b>
 From this repetition of what has been stated in the previous verse concerning those 'born 
in the house' and those 'bought with silver', anyone may see that there is a Divine arcanum that is not evident from the sense of the letter. The arcanum is that purification from those foul loves 
is absolutely vital inside the Church, for the reason also that people inside the Church are capable of rendering sacred things unclean, something that those outside the Church, that is, gentiles, cannot 
do. For this reason those inside the Church stand in greater danger of condemnation. What is more, those inside the Church are capable of formulating and adopting false assumptions that are contrary 
to truths of faith themselves, whereas those outside the Church cannot do so because they have no knowledge of those truths. Thus those inside the Church are capable of profaning sacred truths, but 
not those outside. For more on these matters, see Volume One, in <a href="1059.htm">1059</a>, <a href="1327.htm">1327</a>, <a href="1328.htm">1328</a>.

Quod `circumcidendo circumcidetur' significet quod illi omnino removebunt a se amores sui et mundi, nempe qui intra Ecclesiam qui significantur per `natum domus et emptum argento {1},' constat a repraesentatione 
`circumcisionis' quod sit purificatio ab amoribus sui et mundi, de qua supra n. 2039; hic repetitur iterum quod circumcidentur, et dicitur quod circumcidendo circumcidetur {2}, quo exprimitur 
necessitas, hoc est, quod omnino ab illis amoribus purificandi; et quia significantur illi qui intra Ecclesiam, hic filii alienigenae non memorantur, nam per hos, ut supra n. 2049 ostensum, significantur 
illi qui extra Ecclesiam sunt; [2]] ex repetitione eorum quae in versu praecedente dicta sunt de `natis domus' et `emptis argento; quisque videre potest quod Divinum arcanum sit quod ex sensu 
litterae non patet, arcanum est quod purificatio a foedis illis amoribus maxime necessaria sit intra Ecclesiam, ex causa etiam quia qui intra Ecclesiam sunt, impura possunt reddere ipsa sancta, quod 
illi qui extra Ecclesiam, seu gentes, facere nequeunt; inde periculum damnationis illis majus est; praeterea illi qui intra Ecclesiam, principia falsi contra ipsa vera fidei possunt formare et iis imbui, 
qui autem {3} extra Ecclesiam sunt, id non possunt quia ignorant illa; ita illi profanare possunt sancta vera, hi vero non; de quibus plura videantur in Parte Prima n. 1059, 1327, 1328. 	@1 emtionem
