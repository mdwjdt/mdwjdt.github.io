<h3 align="center" class="ired">属天的奥秘 第4656节</h3>
<h4 align="center"></h4><p><strong>4656.</strong>有一个灵人在我左耳廓的后面部分，也就是耳上肌所在的地方向我说话。他告诉我，他被派到我这里，是为了说明，他根本不反思别人所说的话，只是用他的耳朵把它们听进去。当他说话时，可以说每句话都是他嗝出来的；他还说，这就是他的说话方式。我由此得知他的话没有任何内在之物，因而只有少许生命；这也是为何他嗝出他的话的原因。我被告知，很少注意任何事物的真实含义的那种人就属于外耳的软骨和骨头部分。 </p>

<p align="center"><b>Potts(1905-1910) 4656</b></p><p><b>4656.</b>
There was a spirit who spoke with me at my left auricle at its hinder part where are its elevator muscles. He told me that he was sent to inform me that he does not reflect at all upon the things which 
others are speaking, but merely takes them in with his ears. When he was speaking he as it were belched out his words, and also said that this was his manner of speaking. From this it was given to 
know that there was nothing interior in his speech, thus little of life; and that this was the reason of the belching. It was said that those who attend little to the sense of a thing are those who belong 
to the cartilaginous and bony part of the external ear. </p>

Once there was a spirit who spoke to me, doing so next to my left auricle, to the rear part of it where the elevator muscles of the auricle are placed. He told me that he had been sent to me to say that 
he did not reflect at all on what others said but merely took it in with his ears. When he spoke he seemed to belch out each word, and said that this was how he actually spoke. From this I was allowed 
to see that his speech had no interior content and thus little life, and that this was the reason why he belched his words out I was told that the kind of people who pay little attention to what 
anything really means are ones who belong to the cartilage-like and bony part of the outer ear. </p>

</p><b>4656.</b>
Erat spiritus qui mecum loquebatur ad auriculam sinistram, ad posteriorem ejus partem ubi musculi elevatores auriculae; is mihi dicebat quod ad me missus ad dicendum quod is nihil reflectit super 
illa quae alii loquuntur, modo auribus illa capiat: cum loquebatur, voces quasi {1}eructabat; dixit quoque quod ita loquatur: inde scire dabatur quod interiora non inessent ejus loquelae, ita parum 
vitae, et quod inde eructatio talis; dictum quod tales qui parum ad sensum rei attendunt, sint qui ad cartilagineam et osseam partem auris externae pertinent.      @1 eructabantur$ </p>
