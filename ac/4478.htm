<h3 align="center" class="ired">属天的奥秘 第4478节</h3>
<h4 align="center"></h4><p><strong>4478.</strong>“对本城的人讲说”表劝说。这从“讲”的含义清楚可知。“讲”（speak）是指意愿，以及流入（参看<a href="2951.htm">2951</a>，<a href="3037.htm">3037</a>节），在此之所以表示劝说，是因为劝说存在于意愿某事的人里面；当这样的人影响别人或由此流入时，他就会进行劝说。此外，“本城的人”是指那些处于教义真理的人，在此是指那些处于类似示剑所代表的真理之真理的人。因为在古时，一座城无非是属于一个民族的一个家族，那些属于一个家族的人住在一起就是被称为一座“城”。由于就内义而言，所指的不是家族，而是指这个家族在生活和教义上的性质，故“城”表示教义的真理，其“居民”表示教义的良善（参看<a href="402.htm">402</a>，<a href="2268.htm">2268</a>，<a href="2449.htm">2449</a>，<a href="2451.htm">2451</a>，<a href="2712.htm">2712</a>，<a href="2943.htm">2943</a>，<a href="3216.htm">3216</a>节）。但当一座城市的居民被称为本城的“人”时，所指的就不是教义的良善，而是教义的真理，因为在圣言中，“人”（men [viri]，即男人）表示真理（<a href="3134.htm">3134</a>节）。</p>

And spoke unto the men of their city, saying. That this signifies persuasion, is evident from the signification of "to speak," as being to will and also to flow in (see n. 2951, 3037), here to persuade, 
because he who wills is in persuasion, and he who flows in therefrom, communicates persuasion. The "men of the city" are they who are in truths of doctrine, here who are in similar truths to those 
represented by Shechem. For in ancient times a city was nothing else than one family of a nation, and the dwelling together of those who were of one family was called a "city." And as in the internal 
sense it is not the family that is understood, but the quality of the family in respect to life and doctrine, by "city" is signified the truth of doctrine, and by its "inhabitants" the good of doctrine 
(see n. 402, 2268, 2449, 2451, 2712, 2943, 3216). But when the inhabitants of a city are called the "men" of the city, it is not the good of doctrine but its truths which are then signified, for in 
the Word "men" [viri] denote truths (n. 3134). </p>

<p align="center"><b>Elliott(1983-1999) 4478</b></p><p><b>4478.</b>
'And they spoke to the men of the city, saying' means persuasion. This becomes clear from the meaning of 'speaking' as willing and also as flowing in, dealt with in <a href="2951.htm">2951</a>, <a href="3037.htm">3037</a>. In this case persuading 
is meant because persuasion exists in one who wills something; and when anyone like this influences another he communicates his persuasion. Furthermore 'the men of the city' means those with whom the 
truths of doctrine are present, in this case truths like those with Shechem. For in ancient times a city was nothing other than one family belonging to a nation; the dwelling together of those who belonged 
to one family was called a city. And because in the internal sense it is not the family that is meant but the essential nature of that family so far as life and doctrine are concerned, 'city' 
means the truth of doctrine and 'inhabitants' the good of doctrine, see <a href="402.htm">402</a>, <a href="2268.htm">2268</a>, <a href="2449.htm">2449</a>, <a href="2451.htm">2451</a>, <a href="2712.htm">2712</a>, <a href="2943.htm">2943</a>, <a href="3216.htm">3216</a>. But when the inhabitants of a city are referred to as 'the men of the city' it is not the 
good of doctrine that is meant but the truths of it; for in the Word 'men' means truths, <a href="3134.htm">3134</a>. </p>

`Et locuti ad viros urbis suae, dicendo': quod significet persuasionem, constare potest (c)a significatione `loqui' quod sit velle, et quoque influere, de qua n. 2951, 3037, hic persuadere quia qui 
vult, in persuasione est, et qui inde influit, persuasionem communicat; et `viri urbis' sunt qui in veris doctrinae, hic `in veris' similibus cum Shechemo; nam urbs antiquis temporibus non erat 
aliud quam una gentis familia; cohabitatio (c)eorum qui ab una {1} familia, dicebatur urbs; et quia in sensu interno non intelligitur familia, sed quale ejus quoad vitam et doctrinam, per `urbem' significatur 
doctrinae verum, et per `habitatores' doctrinae bonum, videatur n. 402, 2268, (x)2449, 2451, 2712, 2943, 3216; at cum habitatores urbis nominantur `viri urbis' tunc non bonum {2} doctrinae 
sed vera ejus significantur; in Verbo enim `viri' sunt vera, n. 3134      @1 eadem$      @2 bona$ </p>
