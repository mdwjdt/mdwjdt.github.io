<h3 align="center" class="ired">属天的奥秘 第1034节</h3>
<h4 align="center"></h4><p><strong>1034.</strong>“凡有血肉的，不再被诸水的泛滥剪除”表人类不会象上古教会的最后一代那样灭亡。这从前面有关灭亡的大洪水前之人，即被诸水的泛滥剪除之人的论述清楚可知。前文（<a href="310.htm">310</a>节）已说明，情况乃是这样：上古教会的最后一代有这样的性质，当其心智的意愿部分全然败坏时，觉知部分也就一同败坏了。结果，觉知无法与意愿分离，新的意愿无法在觉知中形成，因为其心智的这两个部分是粘合在一起的。主预见到这一点，于是规定觉知可以与意愿分离，从而得以更新。由于主规定诸如大洪水前这种类型的人以后不再存在，故此处经上说“凡有血肉的，不再被诸水的泛滥剪除”。</p>

<p><strong>[NCE]1034.</strong> No more will all flesh be cut off by the waters of a flood means that they will not be obliterated, as the final generation of the earliest church was. This can be seen from the things said earlier about the pre-Flood people who died off — the people "cut off by the waters of a flood" [<a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_1034/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_310" target=_top>310-311</a>, <a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_1034/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_591" target=_top>591-595</a>, <a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_1034/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_792" target=_top>792-813</a>]. In <a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_1034/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_310" target=_top>310</a> above, the nature of the situation was explained: The final generation to inherit the earliest church was such that when their volitional side had been perverted, their intellectual side was too. Their intellectual side could not be detached from their volitional side, allowing a new will to be formed in it, so tightly did the two parts of their mind cling together.<br />Because the Lord foresaw that this would happen, he provided for the ability of our intellectual side to detach from our voluntary side and in this way be renewed. Accordingly, since he provided that people like that pre-Flood race would never come into existence again, the current verse says that no more would any flesh be cut down by the waters of a flood. </p>
<p align="center"><b>Potts(1905-1910) 1034</b></p><p><b>1034.</b>
Neither shall all flesh be cut off anymore by the waters of the flood. That this signifies that they should not perish, as did the last posterity of the Most Ancient Church, is evident from what has 
been said before about those before the flood, who perished, being signified by those who were cut off by the waters of the flood. It has been shown before (n. 310) how the case was, namely, that the 
last posterity of the Most Ancient Church was of such a nature that both the will part and the intellectual part of their mind, had become corrupt, so that the intellectual could not be separated from 
the will, and a new will be formed in the intellectual, since both parts of their mind cohered together. And because this was foreseen, it was also provided by the Lord that the intellectual in man might 
be separated from the will, and thus be renewed. And therefore because it was provided that such men as were that race before the flood should not afterwards exist, therefore it is here said, "neither 
shall all flesh be cut off anymore by the waters of the flood." </p>

<p align="center"><b>Elliott(1983-1999) 1034</b></p><p><b>1034.</b>
'Never again will all flesh be cut off by the waters of the flood' means that men would not perish in the way that the final descendants of the Most Ancient Church had done. This is clear from what has 
been stated already about the people before the Flood who perished, that is, the people who were cut off by the waters of the flood. It has been shown already in <a href="310.htm">310</a> what the situation was - that the 
final descendants of the Most Ancient Church were such that when the will part of their minds had become corrupted, the understanding part had been simultaneously corrupted as well. Consequently the 
understanding part could not be separated from the will part and a new will be formed in the understanding part, since the two parts of their mind were knit together. Because this was foreseen provision 
was also made by the Lord that the understanding part with man could be separated from the will part and so be renewed. And because it was thus provided that no type of human being should afterwards 
arise like that people before the Flood, it is therefore said here that 'never again will any flesh be cut off by the waters of the flood'. </p>

<p align="center"><b>Latin(1748-1756) 1034</b>
</p><b>1034.</b>
Quod 'non excidetur omnis caro amplius ab aquis diluvii' significet quod non perituri sint, sicut ultima posteritas Antiquissimae Ecclesiae, constat ab illis quae prius de antediluvianis qui perierunt, 
dicta sunt, qui sunt qui excisi ab aquis diluvii; ostensum prius est n. 310 quomodo se res habuit, nempe quod Antiquissimae Ecclesiae posteritas ultima talis fuerit ut cum voluntarium eorum, etiam 
simul intellectuale eorum fuisset corruptum, sic ut apud eos non potuisset intellectuale separari ab eorum voluntario, et in intellectuali formari nova voluntas, nam ita utraque mentis eorum pars cohaerebat: 
quod quia praevisum, etiam provisum a Domino fuit ut apud hominem separari posset intellectuale ejus a voluntario, et sic renovari: et sic quia provisum, quod talis homo postea non existeret 
qualis gens ista antediluviana, ideo hic dicitur quod 'non (x)excidetur amplius ulla caro ab aquis diluvii.' </p>
