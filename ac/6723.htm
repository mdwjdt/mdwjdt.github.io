<h3 align="center" class="ired">属天的奥秘 第6723节</h3>
<h4 align="center"></h4><p><strong>6723.</strong>“就取了一个灯心草箱”表一个容器，虽然粗糙，却源于真理。这从“箱”和“灯心草”的含义清楚可知：“箱”或小柜子，是一个容器，或封装某种东西之物，如下文所述；“灯心草”是指粗糙，却源于真理之物。“灯心草”表示某种粗糙之物，这是显而易见的；它之所以表示源于真理之物，是因为“灯心草”就具有这种含义，这一点清楚可见于以赛亚书：<br />古实河外翅膀遮蔽之地有祸了；差遣使者在水面上，坐灯心草的器皿过海。（以赛亚书<a href="http://39-27.cn/赛18.1.htm">18:1</a>-<a href="http://39-27.cn/赛18.2.htm">2</a>）<br />“翅膀遮蔽之地”表示教会，它通过基于记忆知识的推理而给自己带来黑暗；“古实河外”表示转向用来确认虚假原则或错误假设的认知或知识（<a href="1164.htm">1164</a>节）；“差遣使者过海”表示求助于记忆知识（参看<a href="28.htm">28</a>节）；“在水面上，坐灯心草的器皿”表示真理的最低级或极其粗糙的容器。<br />这个词在以赛亚书也用于反面意义：<br />干地要变为水池，干渴之地要化为水泉；必有青草代替芦苇和灯心草。（以赛亚书<a href="http://39-27.cn/赛35.7.htm">35:7</a>）<br />“必有青草代替芦苇和灯心草”表示这一事实：必须真正的记忆知识代替诸如不含真理在里面的那类事物。“青草”表示真正的记忆知识，这一点从圣言中提及它的经文明显看出来。<br />由于已经规定摩西要代表神的律法或圣言方面的主，尤其代表圣言的历史部分，所以下面的事件发生了，即：当摩西还是一个婴儿时，他被放在一个箱子或小柜子里，不过是一个粗糙的箱子或柜子，因为该律法尚在最早的开始，还因为他躺卧在那里只是一个代表。不过，后来等到真正的神之律法本身从西乃山发出时，它被放在一个约柜里，被称为“法柜”。因为神的律法被放在约柜里面（参看出埃及记<a href="http://39-27.cn/出40.20.htm">40:20</a>；列王记上<a href="http://39-27.cn/王上8.9.htm">8:9</a>）；摩西五经也被放在它里面（申命记<a href="http://39-27.cn/申31.24.htm">31:24</a>-<a href="http://39-27.cn/申31.26.htm">26</a>）。<br />因此，约柜是最神圣的，因为它代表神性律法方面的主之神性人身；事实上，从主的神性人身发出的是神性律法或神性真理，也就是约翰福音中所提到的“道”，即圣言：<br />太初有道，道与神同在，道就是神。道成了肉身，住在我们中间；我们也见过祂的荣光，正是父独生子的荣光。（约翰福音<a href="http://39-27.cn/约1.1.htm">1:1</a>，<a href="http://39-27.cn/约1.14.htm">14</a>）<br />由于约柜代表某种至为神圣的事物，所以带有基路伯的施恩座放在约柜上面；带有灯盏的灯台和放有陈设饼的金桌挨着盖约柜的幔子，它们都表示神性之爱。这就是摩西还是个婴儿时，因代表神的律法而被放在一个小柜子里的原因。</p>

And she took an ark of rush. That this signifies what is of low value round about, but nevertheless derived from truth, is evident from the signification of "an ark,"* as being what is round about, or 
that in which anything is inclosed (of which in what follows); and from the signification of "rush," as being what is of low value, but nevertheless derived from truth. That "rush" denotes what is of 
low value is evident, and that it denotes what is derived from truth is because a "rush" has this signification, as is clear in Isaiah: </p>
<p>     Woe to the land that is overshadowed with wings, which is 
beyond the rivers of Cush; that sendeth envoys to the sea, even in vessels of rush upon the faces of the waters (Isa. 18:1-2); </p>
<p>"the land overshadowed with wings" denotes the church, which darkens itself 
by means of reasonings from memory-knowledges; "beyond the rivers of Cush" denotes to the knowledges whereby they confirm false principles (n. 1164); "to send envoys to the sea" denotes to consult 
memory-knowledges (see n. 28); "in vessels of rush upon the faces of the waters," denotes the lowest receptacles of truth. [2] In the opposite sense: </p>
<p>     The dry place shall become a pool, and the 
thirsty place springs of waters; there shall be grass instead of the reed and the rush (Isa. 35:7); </p>
<p>"grass instead of the reed and the rush," denotes that there will be true memory-knowledge instead 
of things in which there is no truth. That "grass" denotes true memory-knowledge is plain from the passages in the Word where it is mentioned. [3] As it was provided that Moses should represent the 
Lord as to the law Divine, or the Word, specifically the historic Word, it was therefore brought about that when he was an infant he was placed in a little ark, but in one of low value, because he was 
in his first rising, and because his being there was only a representative; but that afterward when the law Divine itself had shone forth from Mount Sinai, it was placed in an ark which was called 
the "ark of the testimony." (That the law Divine was placed in the ark, see Exod. 40:20; 1 Kings 8:9; and also that the books of Moses were placed in it, Deut. 31:24-26.) [4] Hence the ark was most holy, 
because it represented the Lord's Divine Human as to the Divine law; for from the Lord's Divine Human proceeds the Divine law, or the Divine truth, which is the same as the "Word" mentioned in John: </p>
<p> 
    In the beginning was the Word, and the Word was with God, and God was the Word; and the Word was made flesh, and dwelt among us; and we saw His glory, the glory as of the Only-begotten of the 
Father (John 1:1, 14). And as the ark represented that most holy thing, the propitiatory with the cherubs was placed over the ark; and near the veil thereof the lampstand with its lamps, and the golden 
table with loaves, both of which signified the Divine love. This then is the reason why Moses, when an infant, because he represented the law Divine, was placed in a little ark. * The Latin here 
is capsa seu arcula, "a repository or little ark;" the Latin term used in the text "she took an ark of rush" being capsa. The Hebrew word thus rendered is the same as that used to designate the ark built by Noah. </p>

<p align="center"><b>Elliott(1983-1999) 6723</b></p><p><b>6723.</b>
'And she took [for him] a box made of rush' means a container which, though crude, was nevertheless derived from truth. This is clear from the meaning of 'a box' or little ark as that which is a container 
or in which something is enclosed, dealt with below; and from the meaning of 'rush' as that which is crude but nevertheless is derived from truth. The fact that 'rush' refers to something crude 
is self-evident; and the reason why it refers to something derived from truth is that 'rush' has that meaning, as is plain in Isaiah, </p>
<blockquote>
Woe to the land overshadowing with wings, which is beyond the rivers 
of Cush, which sends ambassadors to the sea, and in vessels made of rush on the face of the waters! <a href="http://bible.gospelcom.net/cgi-bin/bible?passage=Isa%2018:1,%202&amp;version=ESV&amp;interface=print&amp;showfn=yes&amp;showxref">Isa 18:1, 2</a>. 
</blockquote>
<p>'The land overshadowing with wings' stands for the Church which brings darkness 
to itself through the use of reasonings based on factual knowledge. 'Beyond the rivers of Cush' stands for turning to cognitions that are used to confirm false assumptions, <a href="1164.htm">1164</a>. 'Sending ambassadors 
to the sea' stands for resorting to factual knowledge, <a href="28.htm">28</a>. 'In vessels made of rush over the face of the waters' stands for very crude receptacles of truth. </p>
<p></p>
<p><b>[2]</b>
 The expression is used in the contrary 
sense in the same prophet,  </p>
<blockquote>
The dry place will become a pond and the thirsty ground wellsprings of water; [there will be] grass instead of reed and rush. <a href="http://bible.gospelcom.net/cgi-bin/bible?passage=Isa%2035:7&amp;version=ESV&amp;interface=print&amp;showfn=yes&amp;showxref">Isa 35:7</a>. 
</blockquote>
<p>'Grass instead of reed 
and rush' stands for the fact that there will be factual knowledge containing truth instead of such things as hold no truth within them. The meaning of 'grass' as factual knowledge containing truth is 
evident from places in the Word in which the expression appears. </p>
<p></p>
<p><b>[3]</b>
 Since it had been preordained that Moses should represent the Lord in respect of the law of God or the Word, in particular the 
historical part of the Word, the incident therefore took place in which, when he was an infant, he was put in a box or little ark, though a crude one because that law was in its very earliest beginnings 
and because there was merely a representative of it lying there in the ark. But later on the real law of God, after it had flashed from Mount Sinai, was put in an ark, called the Ark of the Testimony. 
For the fact that the law of God was put inside the ark, see <a href="http://bible.gospelcom.net/cgi-bin/bible?passage=Exod%2040:20;%201&amp;version=ESV&amp;interface=print&amp;showfn=yes&amp;showxref">Exod 40:20; 1</a> Kings 8:9, also the Books of Moses [placed to the side of it], Deut. 31:24-26. </p>
<p></p>
<p><b>[4]</b>
 The ark was therefore most holy because 
it represented the Lord's Divine Human in respect of the Divine Law; for from the Lord's Divine Human radiates the Divine Law or Divine Truth, which is the same as the Word spoken of in John, </p>
<p>In 
the beginning was the Word, and the Word was with God, and the Word was God. And the Word became flesh and dwelt among us, and we beheld His glory, glory as of the Only Begotten from the Father. John 1:1, <a href="14.htm">14</a>. </p>
<p>And since the ark represented something so very holy, the mercy seat with the cherubim was placed over the ark, and next to the veil concealing it there was the lampstand with lamps and 
the table of gold with leaves, both of which were signs of the Divine Love. This then is the reason why Moses, because he represented the law of God, was put in a little ark when he was an infant. </p>

`Et accepit [sibi] capsam junci': quod significet vile quo circumcirca, sed usque ex vero derivatum, constat ex significatione {1}`capsae' seu `arculae' quod sit id quod circumcirca est, seu id in quo 
aliquid inclusum est, de qua sequitur; et ex significatione `junci' quod sit vile, sed usque a vero derivatum; quod `juncus' sit vile, patet; quod sit a vero derivatum, est quia `juncus' id significat, 
ut liquet apud Esaiam, Vae terrae adumbranti alis, quae trans flumina Kuschi, qui mittit in {2}mare legatos, et in vasis junci super faciebus aquarum! xviii [1,] 2; </p>
<p>`terra adumbrans alis' pro Ecclesia 
quae per ratiocinia ex scientificis se obtenebrat; `trans flumina Kuschi' pro ad cognitiones per qua confirmant principia falsa, n. 1164; `mittere in {2}mare legatos' pro consulere scientifica, 
n. 28; `in vasis junci super faciebus aquarum pro receptaculis veri vilissimis. 	2 In sensu opposito, apud eundem, Erit aridus locus in stagnum, et siticulosus in scaturigines aquarum, gramen pro 
calamo et junco, xxxv 7; </p>
<p>`gramen pro calamo et junco' pro quod erit verum scientificum pro talibus in quibus non aliquid verum datur; quod `gramen' sit verum scientificum, patet a locis {3}in Verbo ubi 
nominatur. 	3 Quia provisum fuit quod Moses repraesentaret Dominum quoad legem Divinam seu Verbum, in specie quoad Verbum historicum, idcirco factum est, {4}cum infans, quod poneretur in capsa seu 
arcula, sed in vili quia in primo ortu, et quia erat modo repraesentativum quod ibi erat; sed dein {5}quod ipsa lex Divina, postquam exsplenduerat e monte Sinai, poneretur in arca, quae Arca Testimonii 
vocata est; quod intus in arca lex (d)Divina posita {6}fuerit, videatur Exod xl 20; 1 Reg. viii 9, et quoque quod Libri Mosis, Deut. xxxi 24-26; 4 {7}inde arca sanctissima fuit quia repraesentabat 
Divinum Humanum Domini {8}quoad Divinam Legem; (m)nam a Divino Humano Domini procedit Divina Lex seu Divinum Verum, quod idem est cum Verbo, apud Johannem, In principio erat Verbum, et Verbum erat apud 
Deum, et Deus erat Verbum; et Verbum caro factum, et habitavit apud nos, et vidimus gloriam Ipsius, gloriam ut Unigeniti a Patre, Joh. i 1, 14;(n) {9}et quia arca sanctissimum illud repraesentabat, 
ponebatur super arcam propitiatorium cum cherubis; et juxta velum ejus candelabrum {10} cum lucernis, et mensa aurea cum panibus, quae bina significabant `Divinum Amorem'.  Haec nunc causa est quod 
Moses cum infans, quia repraesentaret legem Divinam, positus fuerit in arcula. 	@1 Heb.    (tebhah); the word also used for the `Ark' of Noah, rendered arca by S in Gen. vi 14 and in other verses.  Heb.
