<h3 align="center" class="ired">属天的奥秘 第711节</h3>
<h4 align="center"></h4><p><strong>711.</strong>“进入方舟”表示做好准备。这一点在前一章18节早已说明。然而，在那里，它表示为拯救觉知之物，即信之真理而做好准备，而此处它表示为拯救意愿之物，即仁之善而做好准备。人若非做好准备，即具备真理和良善，就决不能重生，更不用说经历试探了。因为在这种时刻，与他同在的恶灵会唤起他的虚假和邪恶。倘若真理和良善不存在，虚假和邪恶无法被主折向它们，并被它们驱散，他就会屈服。真理和良善就是主为这个目的所保存的余留。</p>

<p><strong>[NCE]711.</strong> The fact that entering the ark means being prepared was stated above at <a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_711/bible_king-james-version_genesis_6_18" target=_top>Genesis 6:18</a>, but the meaning there was preparation in regard to intellectual things, which are the truths that faith espouses.{*1} Here the meaning is preparation in regard to affairs of the will, which are the good impulses of charity, leading to salvation.<br />To be prepared is to be equipped with true thoughts and good impulses, and unless we are prepared, we can never regenerate, still less be tested. The evil spirits [who are] present with us during those processes stir up everything false and evil in us; and if we lack anything true or good to which the Lord can redirect the evil and falsity, and by which he can disperse it, we go under.<br />The truth and goodness are remaining traces that the Lord has stored away for just such a purpose.<br /><br /><strong>Footnotes:</strong><br />{*1} Swedenborg's cross-reference here seems slightly inaccurate. In explaining <a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_711/bible_king-james-version_genesis_6_18" target=_top>Genesis 6:18</a> at <a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_711/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_667" target=_top>667</a>, he does not say that to enter the ark means being prepared; he says that it means being saved. Earlier than that, however, in <a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_711/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_653" target=_top>653</a>, where <a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_711/bible_king-james-version_genesis_6_16" target=_top>Genesis 6:16</a> is explained, he describes the process of sifting out false ideas as a preparation — that is, for regeneration and thus for salvation.

That to "enter into the ark" is to be prepared, has been stated before, at verse 18 of the preceding chapter. But there it signified that he was prepared for salvation as to things of the understanding, 
which are truths of faith; but here as to things of the will, which are goods of charity. Unless a man is prepared, that is, furnished with truths and goods, he can by no means be regenerated, still 
less undergo temptations. For the evil spirits who are with him at such a time excite his falsities and evils; and if truths and goods are not present, to which they may be bent by the Lord, and by 
which they may be dispersed, he succumbs. These truths and goods are the remains which are reserved by the Lord for such uses. </p>

<p align="center"><b>Elliott(1983-1999) 711</b></p><p><b>711.</b>
That 'entering into the ark' means being made ready has been stated already at verse 18 of the previous chapter. There however it meant being made ready for salvation as regards things of the understanding, 
which are the truths of faith, whereas here it means being made ready as regards those of the will, which are goods springing from charity. Unless a person has been made ready, that is, has been 
supplied with truths and goods, he cannot possibly be regenerated, still less undergo temptations, for the evil spirits who are at that time with him activate the falsities and evils that are his. 
And unless truths and goods are present towards which they are turned by the Lord and by which they are scattered, he goes under. The truths and goods are the remnants which the Lord preserves for such purposes. </p>

</p><b>711.</b>
Quod 'intrare in arcam' sit praeparari, prius cap. praec. ad vers. 18 dictum; sed ibi significatum, quod praeparatus quoad intellectualia, quae sunt vera fidei; hic quoad voluntaria, quae sunt bona 
charitatis, ut salvaretur. Homo nisi praeparatus, hoc est, instructus veris et bonis, nusquam potest regenerari, minus subire tentationes; nam mali spiritus, qui tunc apud eum, excitant ejus falsa et 
mala; nisi adsint vera et bona ad quae flectantur a Domino et per quae discutiantur, succumbit: vera et bona sunt reliquiae, quae ad tales usus a Domino reservantur. </p>
