<h3 align="center" class="ired">属天的奥秘 第1970节</h3>
<h4 align="center"></h4><p><strong>1970.</strong>真正的异象是指诸如来世真实存在的那类事物的异象或景象。这些事物无非是灵眼能看到，而肉眼看不到的真实事物。当人的内视（即他的灵所具有的视觉）被主打开后，人就能看见它们，而且，当脱离肉身进入来世后，他还会进入其中，因为人其实是披着肉身的灵。这就是先知们的异象。当这种视觉被打开时，那些真实存在于灵人们当中的事物就会在比世间正午之光还要明亮的光中被看到。不仅代表物，而且灵人们本身也会被看到。这一切还伴随着一种直觉，如：他们是谁，是何性质，从哪里来，往哪里去，有什么样的情感、说服力，甚至具有什么样的信等等（<a href="1388.htm">1388</a>，<a href="1394.htm">1394</a>节）。所有这一切都会通过活生生的、完全就象人类的言语得以证实，并摆脱一切幻觉。</p>

By genuine visions are meant visions or sights of such things in the other life as have real existence, and are nothing but actual things that can be seen by the eyes of the spirit and not by the eyes 
of the body, and that appear to a man when his interior sight is opened by the Lord (that is, the sight which his spirit has), and into which he comes when, separated from the body, he passes into the 
other life; for a man is a spirit clothed with a body. Such were the visions of the prophets.       When this sight is opened, then those things which have actual existence with spirits are seen in 
clearer day than that of noon in this world, not only the representatives, but also the spirits themselves, together with a perception of who they are, also what they are, where they are, whence they 
come, whither they are going; also of what affection, what persuasion, nay of what faith they are (n. 1388, 1394), all confirmed by living speech, exactly as if it were human speech, and this free from 
all fallacy. </p>

By genuine visions are meant visions or sights of those things which have real existence in the next life, and which are nothing else than real things that may be seen with the eyes of the spirit but 
not with those of the body. They are visible to man when his interior sight is opened by the Lord, that is, the sight his spirit possesses and into which he also enters when, separated from the body, 
he passes into the next life; for man is a spirit clothed with a body. Such were the visions of the prophets. When this sight is opened the things which have actual existence among spirits are seen in 
light brighter than midday light of the world; not only are representatives seen but also the spirits themselves. This is accompanied by a perception as to who those spirits are, and also what they 
are like, where they are, where they have come from, where they are going to, and what affection, conviction, and indeed faith exists with them, <a href="1388.htm">1388</a>, <a href="1394.htm">1394</a>. All of this is confirmed by living speech, 
altogether as if it were human speech, and free of all illusion. </p>

Per visiones genuinas intelliguntur visiones seu visa illarum rerum quae realiter existunt in altera vita, et sunt non nisi quam res quae oculis spiritus non oculis corporis videri possunt, et apparent 
homini quando ejus interior visus aperitur a Domino, hoc est, ille visus quem ejus spiritus habet,' in quem etiam venit cum separatus a corpore in alteram vitam transit; nam homo est spiritus corpore 
amictus; tales visiones fuerunt prophetarum.  Cum aperitur hic visus, tunc videntur in clariore die quam est meridiana mundi, illa quae apud spiritus actualiter existunt, non solam repraesentativa, 
sed etiam ipsi spiritus, una cum perceptione quinam sunt, tum quales sunt, ubi sunt, undenam veniunt, quo abeunt, qua affectione, qua persuasione, immo qua fide sunt, n. 1388, 1394, confirmatis per 
vivam loquelam, prorsus ut humanam, et hoc absque omni fallacia. </p>
