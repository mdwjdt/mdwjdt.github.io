<h3 align="center" class="ired">属天的奥秘 第1631节</h3>
<h4 align="center"></h4><p><strong>1631.</strong>那些活在肉身时住在华丽宫殿中的富人若将他们的天堂置于这类事物，缺乏良知和仁爱，并以种种借口掠夺他人财物，当进入来世时，如前所述，他们先被引入和在世时一样的生活中。有时，他们在那里也被允许住在如在世时那样的宫殿中。因为在来世，所有人一开始都被当作客人和新人接待；由于他们的内层和生活目的尚未显露出来，故主的天使被派来给予他们快乐，并善待他们。然而，场景逐渐发生变化，宫殿慢慢消失，变成小房子，然后渐渐破败，直到最后不复存在。这时，他们象乞丐那样四处游荡，请求被接纳。但由于具有这种本性，所以他们从各社群被逐出，最后变成排泄物，并散发出坏牙般的恶臭。</p><br />

<p><strong>[NCE]1631.</strong> Some people have been rich during bodily life and lived in stately mansions, identifying their heaven with these advantages and cheating others out of their possessions by various ruses, without conscience and without compassion. When they come into the other life, they are first introduced into exactly the same kind of life they had lived in the world (as noted before [搂<a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_1631/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_943" target=_top>943</a>].) Sometimes they are even allowed at this point to live in mansions, just as they had in the world, since at first everyone in the other life is welcomed as a guest and a newcomer. In order to avoid exposing the inner depths and life goals of these people as yet, angels show them every favor and kindness, on behalf of the Lord. But the scene changes. The mansions gradually fade and turn into huts, which degenerate further and further until they finally disappear. Then the owners wander around like beggars and ask to be taken in, but because they are what they are, society rejects them. In the end they come to resemble excrement, and a cloud smelling like [rotten] teeth wafts from them. </p>

They who had been rich in the life of the body, and had dwelt in magnificent palaces, placing their heaven in such things, and, being destitute of conscience and charity, had despoiled others of their 
goods under various pretenses, when they come into the other life, are, as before said, first introduced into the very same life that they had in the world. And there also they are sometimes allowed 
to dwell in palaces, as they had done in the world. For in the other life all are at first received as guests and as newcomers; and as their interiors and ends of life are not yet to be disclosed, angels 
from the Lord treat them with favor and kindness. But the scene is changed. The palaces are gradually dissipated, and become small houses, more and more mean, and at last none at all. And then they 
wander about, like those who ask alms, and beg to be received. But because they are of such a character, they are expelled from the societies; and at last they become excrementitious, and exhale a 
sphere of the stench of teeth. </p>

On entering the next life people who have been rich during their lifetime and have dwelt in magnificent palaces, fixing their heaven in such things, and who, devoid of conscience or charity, have under 
various pretexts robbed others of their goods, are first led, as stated already, into the selfsame life that was theirs in the world. And sometimes they are allowed to dwell in palaces, just as they 
had done in the world. For all initially are received in the next life as guests and newcomers; and so that their interiors and aims in life may not yet be disclosed, angels from the Lord are sent to 
give them pleasure and treat them kindly. The scene however changes - the palaces slowly fade away and become small houses, becoming successively poorer until at length they cease to exist. At that 
point they go around like people begging for alms, and asking to be taken in. But being what they are, they are rejected from the communities At length they become as excrement, and give off a stink like 
that of bad teeth. </p>

</p><b>1631.</b>
Qui divites fuerunt in vita corporis et in magnificis palatiis habitarunt, in talibus suum caelum ponendo, et absque conscientia et charitate alios sub varia specie suis bonis spoliarunt, illi dum veniunt 
in alteram vitam, primum, ut prius dictum, introducuntur in ipsissimam suam vitam quam habuerunt in mundo, etiam illis tunc quandoque datur habitare similiter in palatiis ut in mundo; sunt enim 
principio omnes in altera vita accepti sicut hospites et novi advenae, quibus quoad interiora et fines vitae nondum detegendis gratificantur et benefaciunt angeli a Domino; sed mutatur scena, palatia 
sensim dissipantur, et fiunt domunculae, successive viliores, tandem nullae; et tunc circumeunt sicut qui stipem quaerunt, petuntque ut recipiantur; sed quia tales sunt, e societatibus expelluntur; et 
tandem fiunt excrementitii, et sphaeram fetoris dentium exhalant. </p>
