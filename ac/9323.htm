<h3 align="center" class="ired">属天的奥秘 第9323节</h3>
<h4 align="center"></h4><p><strong>9323.</strong>“祂必赐福与你的粮与你的水”表爱之良善和信之真理的增长。这从“耶和华赐福”、“粮”和“水”的含义清楚可知：“被耶和华赐福”是指在良善上繁殖或结出果实，在真理上增多（参看<a href="2846.htm">2846</a>，<a href="3406.htm">3406</a>，<a href="4981.htm">4981</a>，<a href="6091.htm">6091</a>，<a href="6099.htm">6099</a>，<a href="8939.htm">8939</a>节），因而是指在诸如属于爱和信的那类事物上增长；“粮”（经上或译为食物，饭，饼等）是指爱之良善（参看<a href="276.htm">276</a>，<a href="680.htm">680</a>，<a href="2165.htm">2165</a>，<a href="2177.htm">2177</a>，<a href="3478.htm">3478</a>，<a href="3735.htm">3735</a>，<a href="3813.htm">3813</a>，<a href="4211.htm">4211</a>，<a href="4217.htm">4217</a>，<a href="4735.htm">4735</a>，<a href="4976.htm">4976</a>，<a href="6118.htm">6118</a>，<a href="8410.htm">8410</a>节）；“水”是指信之真理（<a href="680.htm">680</a>，<a href="739.htm">739</a>，<a href="2702.htm">2702</a>，<a href="3058.htm">3058</a>，<a href="3424.htm">3424</a>，<a href="4976.htm">4976</a>，<a href="5668.htm">5668</a>，<a href="6346.htm">6346</a>，<a href="7307.htm">7307</a>，<a href="8568.htm">8568</a>节）。由于“粮”（经上或译为食物，饭，饼等）表示整体上的一切爱之良善，“水”表示整体上的一切信之真理，还由于“被耶和华赐福”表示在它们上面的一切增长，所以在古代的教会，人们习惯表达祝愿说：愿耶和华赐福与你食物和水；当要表达一切属世的饮食，并由此表示一切属灵的良善和真理时，就说“食物和水”，这也是一种常用的说话方式；因为这些属灵的良善和真理滋养属灵的生命，就像食物和水滋养属世的生命一样（参看<a href="4976.htm">4976</a>节）。<br />在下列经文中，“粮”（经上或译为食物，饭，饼等）和“水”就表示这种良善和真理。以赛亚书：<br />看哪，主万军之耶和华从耶路撒冷和犹大，除掉整个粮杖，整个水杖。（以赛亚书<a href="http://39-27.cn/赛3.1.htm">3:1</a>）<br />“粮杖”表示良善所提供的能力和生命；“水杖”表示真理所提供的能力和生命。以西结书：<br />看哪，我必在耶路撒冷折断他们的粮杖，他们要带着忧虑按分两吃饼；带着惊惶按制子喝水。使他们缺粮缺水，彼此惊惶，因自己的罪孽憔悴。（以西结书<a href="http://39-27.cn/结4.16.htm">4:16</a>，<a href="http://39-27.cn/结4.17.htm">17</a>）<br />“缺粮缺水”表示被剥夺爱之良善和信之真理，这是显而易见的；因为经上说“他们彼此惊惶，因自己的罪孽憔悴”。<br />类似的话出现在以下经文中：<br />他们吃饭必忧虑，喝水必惊惶，因其中居住的众人的强暴，这地必然荒废，失掉其丰满。（以西结书<a href="http://39-27.cn/结12.19.htm">12:19</a>）<br />阿摩司书：<br />看哪，日子将到， 我必打发饥荒到地上；饥荒非因无饼，干渴非因无水，乃因不听耶和华的话。（阿摩司书<a href="http://39-27.cn/摩8.11.htm">8:11</a>）<br />列王纪：<br />神人对耶罗波安说，你就是把你的宫一半给我，我也不同你进去，也不在这地方吃饭喝水，因为耶和华如此吩咐我说，你不可吃饭喝水，也不可从你来的那条路上回去。但伯特利的先知对他说，耶和华告诉他，要与他吃饭喝水（他在说谎）。于是神人与他回去，在他家里吃饭喝水。因此，他被一只狮子撕碎了。（列王记上<a href="http://39-27.cn/王上13.8.htm">13:8</a>，<a href="http://39-27.cn/王上13.9.htm">9</a>，<a href="http://39-27.cn/王上13.16.htm">16</a>-<a href="http://39-27.cn/王上13.19.htm">19</a>，<a href="http://39-27.cn/王上13.24.htm">24</a>）<br />他拒绝与耶罗波安吃饭喝水表示他憎恶那里的良善，也憎恶真理，因为它们都被亵渎了；事实上，耶罗波安亵渎了祭坛，和敬拜的一切圣物，这从那一章的圣言历史描述明显看出来。<br />亚哈作王的时候，有三年半没有下雨，以致饼和水都断绝了；在此期间，以利亚到撒勒法的一个寡妇那里，求她用器皿取点水来给他喝，还求她拿点饼来给他吃（列王纪上17和18章），就表示属灵良善和真理的缺乏。因为如前所述，“饼”（经上或译为饭、食物、粮）表示教会的一切良善，“水”表示教会的一切真理。由于那时，这些事物都具有代表性，因为一个教会的代表存在于他们当中，还因为圣言，甚至历史圣言要通过代表来写成，因此，被荒废的良善和真理由食物和水的缺乏来代表。由于“饼”（经上或译为饭、食物、粮）表示整体上的一切爱之良善，所以祭物被称为“饼”（<a href="2165.htm">2165</a>节），主也自称“天上降下来的粮”（约翰福音<a href="http://39-27.cn/约6.48.htm">6:48</a>，<a href="http://39-27.cn/约6.50.htm">50</a>，<a href="http://39-27.cn/约6.51.htm">51</a>）；因为主就是爱之良善本身。</p>

And He shall bless thy bread, and thy waters. That this signifies the increase of the good of love and truth of faith, is evident from the signification of "being blessed by Jehovah," as being to be 
made fruitful in goods, and multiplied in truths (see n. 2846, 3406, 4981, 6091, 6099, 8939), thus increase in such things as belong to love and faith; from the signification of "bread," as being the 
good of love (see n. 276, 680, 2165, 2177, 3478, 3735, 3813, 4211, 4217, 4735, 4976, 6118, 8410); and from the signification of "water," as being the truth of faith (n. 680, 739, 2702, 3058, 3424, 4976, 
5668, 6346, 7307, 8568). As "bread" signified all the good of love, and "water" all the truth of faith, in the complex, and as "to be blessed of Jehovah" signifies all increase in these, therefore 
it was a customary devout wish in the Ancient Churches that Jehovah would "bless the bread and the water;" and it was also a common form of speaking to say "bread and water," to express all natural food 
and all natural drink, and to mean thereby all spiritual good and all spiritual truth; for these are what nourish the spiritual life, as bread and water nourish the natural life (see n. 4976). [2] 
Such is the signification of "bread and water" in the following passages. In Isaiah: </p>
<p>     Behold Jehovah Zebaoth doth take away from Jerusalem and from Judah the whole staff of bread, and the whole 
staff of water (Isa. 3:1); </p>
<p>"the staff of bread" denotes power and life from good; and "the staff of water," power and life from truth. In Ezekiel: </p>
<p>     Behold, I break the staff of bread in Jerusalem; 
that they may eat bread by weight, and in disquiet; and drink water by measure, and with amazement; that they may be in want of bread and water, and be desolated a man and his brother, and pine away 
because of their iniquity (Ezek. 4:16, 17); </p>
<p>that "to be in want of bread and water" denotes to be deprived of the good of love and truth of faith, is very evident; for it is said "that they may be 
desolated a man and his brother, and pine away because of iniquity." [3] In like manner in the following passages: </p>
<p>     They shall eat their bread with disquiet, and drink their water with amazement, 
that the land may be laid waste from the fullness thereof, because of the violence of all them that dwell therein (Ezek. 12:19).      Behold the days come that I will send a famine in the land; not 
a famine for bread, nor a thirst for water; but for hearing the words of Jehovah (Amos 8:11).      The man of God said to Jeroboam, If thou wilt give me half thine house, I will not go in with thee, 
neither will I eat bread nor drink water in this place; for so Jehovah commanded, saying, Eat no bread, nor drink water, nor return by the way that thou camest. But the prophet from Bethel told him that 
Jehovah had said that he should eat bread with him, and drink water, lying unto him. And he went back with him, and did eat bread in his house and drink water; wherefore he was torn in pieces by a 
lion (1 Kings 13:8, 9, 16-19, 24); </p>
<p>that he "should not eat bread and drink water with Jeroboam" signified that he should abhor the good there, and also the truth, because these had been profaned; for 
Jeroboam profaned the altar and all the holy things of worship, as is plain from the historical narrative of the Word in that chapter. [4] The lack of spiritual good and truth was signified by rain 
not being given for three years and a half during the reign of Ahab, insomuch that bread and water failed; and then Elijah went to a widow in Sarepta and asked from her a little water to drink, and a 
morsel of bread to eat (1 Kings 17 and 18); for, as before said, by "bread" was signified all the good of the church, and by "water" all the truth of the church. As at that time such things were represented 
because the representative of a church existed among them, and because the Word, even the historical Word, was to be written by representatives, therefore the devastation of good and truth was 
represented by a lack of bread and water. As "bread" signified all the good of love in the complex, the sacrifices were called "bread" (n. 2165); and the Lord also calls Himself "the bread which came 
down from heaven" (John 6:48, 50, 51); for the Lord is the good of love itself. </p>

<p align="center"><b>Elliott(1983-1999) 9323</b></p><p><b>9323.</b>
'And He will bless your bread and your water' means the increase of the good of love and of the truth of faith. This is clear from the meaning of 'being blessed by Jehovah' as being made fruitful in 
forms of good and being multiplied in truths, dealt with in <a href="2846.htm">2846</a>, <a href="3406.htm">3406</a>, <a href="4981.htm">4981</a>, <a href="6091.htm">6091</a>, <a href="6099.htm">6099</a>, <a href="8939.htm">8939</a>, thus an increase in the kinds of things that belong to love and faith; from the meaning of 'bread' as the 
good of love, dealt with in <a href="276.htm">276</a>, <a href="680.htm">680</a>, <a href="2165.htm">2165</a>, <a href="2177.htm">2177</a>, <a href="3478.htm">3478</a>, <a href="3735.htm">3735</a>, <a href="3813.htm">3813</a>, <a href="4211.htm">4211</a>, <a href="4217.htm">4217</a>, <a href="4735.htm">4735</a>, <a href="4976.htm">4976</a>, <a href="6118.htm">6118</a>, <a href="8410.htm">8410</a>; and from the meaning of 'water' as the truth of faith, dealt with in <a href="680.htm">680</a>, <a href="739.htm">739</a>, <a href="2702.htm">2702</a>, <a href="3058.htm">3058</a>, <a href="3424.htm">3424</a>, <a href="4976.htm">4976</a>, <a href="5668.htm">5668</a>, <a href="6346.htm">6346</a>, <a href="7307.htm">7307</a>, <a href="8568.htm">8568</a>. Since 'bread' meant all the good of love and 'water' all the truth of faith in their entirety, and since 'being blessed by Jehovah' means every increase in them, people 
in the ancient Churches were accustomed to express the wish, May Jehovah bless [your] bread and water. It was also common to speak of 'bread and water' when all natural food and drink were to be expressed 
and all spiritual goodness and truth to be understood; for the latter are what nourish spiritual life, just as the former nourish natural life, <a href="4976.htm">4976</a>. </p>
<p><b>[2]</b>
 Such goodness and truth are meant by 'bread 
and water' in the following places: In Isaiah,  </p>
<blockquote>
Behold, Jehovah Zebaoth is taking away from Jerusalem and Judah the whole staff of bread, and the whole staff of water. <a href="http://bible.gospelcom.net/cgi-bin/bible?passage=Isa%203:1&amp;version=ESV&amp;interface=print&amp;showfn=yes&amp;showxref">Isa 3:1</a>.  
</blockquote>
<p>'The staff 
of bread' stands for power and life provided by good, 'the staff of water' for power and life provided by truth. In Ezekiel,  </p>
<blockquote>
Behold, I am breaking the staff of bread in Jerusalem, so that they may 
eat bread by weight and with anxiety, and drink water by measure and with dismay; that they may be in want of bread and water, and will be dismayed with one another,<A name="fntext1"></a><A href="#fn1"><sup>a</sup></a> and waste away on account of their 
iniquity. <a href="http://bible.gospelcom.net/cgi-bin/bible?passage=Ezek%204:16,%2017&amp;version=ESV&amp;interface=print&amp;showfn=yes&amp;showxref">Ezek 4:16, 17</a>.  
</blockquote>
<p>'Being in want of bread and water' means being deprived of the good of love and of the truth of faith, as is plainly evident since it says 'that they will be dismayed 
with one with another, and waste away on account of iniquity'.  </p>
<p></p>
<p><b>[3]</b>
 The like occurs again in the same prophet,  </p>
<blockquote>
They will eat their bread with anxiety, and drink their water with dismay, so that 
her land may be devastated of its fullness, on account of the violence of all who dwell in it. <a href="http://bible.gospelcom.net/cgi-bin/bible?passage=Ezek%2012:19&amp;version=ESV&amp;interface=print&amp;showfn=yes&amp;showxref">Ezek 12:19</a>.  
</blockquote>
<p>In Amos,  </p>
<blockquote>
Behold, the days are going to come, in which I will send a famine on the 
land, not a famine of bread, nor a thirst for water, but for hearing the words of Jehovah. <a href="http://bible.gospelcom.net/cgi-bin/bible?passage=Amos%208:11&amp;version=ESV&amp;interface=print&amp;showfn=yes&amp;showxref">Amos 8:11</a>.  
</blockquote>
<p>In the first Book of Kings,  </p>
<p>The man of God said to Jeroboam, If you were to give me half your 
house, I would not go in with you; nor would I eat bread nor drink water in this place. For Jehovah had so commanded, saying, You shall not eat bread, nor drink water, nor return by the way you came. 
But a prophet from Bethel said to him that he had been told by Jehovah that he was to eat bread and drink water with him (he was lying).<A name="fntext2"></a><A href="#fn2"><sup>b</sup></a> And he went back with him, and ate bread in his house, and 
drank water. For that reason he was torn to pieces by a lion. <a href="1.htm">1</a> Kings 13:8, <a href="9.htm">9</a>, <a href="16.htm">16</a>-<a href="19.htm">19</a>, <a href="24.htm">24</a>.  </p>
<p>His refusal to eat bread or drink water with Jeroboam was a sign of his abhorrence of the good there and 
also of the truth, because they had been rendered profane. For Jeroboam had profaned the altar and all the holy things of worship, as is evident from the historical descriptions at this point in the 
Word.  </p>
<p></p>
<p><b>[4]</b>
 A lack of spiritual goodness and truth was meant by the absence of rain for three and a half years when Ahab was king, resulting in a lack of bread and of water, during which time Elijah 
went to a widow in Zarephath and asked her for a little water in a vessel so that he might drink, and a piece of bread so that he might eat, <a href="1.htm">1</a> Kings <a href="17.htm">17</a> and <a href="18.htm">18</a>. For 'bread' meant all the good of the Church, 
and 'water' all the truth of the Church, as stated above. Since such things in those times were representative for the reason that only something representative of the Church existed among those 
people, and since things of a representative nature were used therefore in the composition of the Word, including the historical section, goodness and truth laid waste was accordingly represented by 
the lack of bread and water. And because 'bread' meant all the good of love in its entirety, therefore also the sacrifices were referred to as 'bread', <a href="2165.htm">2165</a>, and therefore also the Lord calls Himself 
'the bread which comes down from heaven', John 6:48, <a href="50.htm">50</a>, <a href="51.htm">51</a>; for the Lord is the Good itself of Love.

`Et benedicet pani tuo et aquis tuis': quod significet incrementum boni amoris et veri fidei, constat ex significatione `benedici a Jehovah {1}' quod sit fructificari in bonis et multiplicari in veris, 
de qua n. 2846, 3406, 4981, 6091, 6099, 8939, ita incrementum in talibus quae sunt amoris et fidei, ex significatione `panis' quod sit bonum amoris, de qua n. 276, 680, 2165, 2177, 3478, 3735, 3813, 
4211, 4217, 4735, 4976, 6118, 8410, et ex significatione `aquae' quod sit verum fidei, de qua n. 680, 739, 2702, 3058, 3424, 4976, 5668, 6346, 7307, 8568.  Quia `panis' significabat omne bonum amoris 
et `aqua' omne verum fidei in complexu, et quia `benedici a Jehovah' significat omne incrementum in illis, ideo sollemne votivam fuit in Ecclesiis antiquis ut Jehovah benedicat pani et aquis, et quoque 
communis formula dicere panem et aquam cum exprimeretur omnis cibus et omnis potus naturalis, ac intelligeretur omne bonum et omne verum spirituale, (o)haec enim sunt quae nutriunt vitam spiritualem 
sicut illa vitam naturalem, n. 4976; [2] haec significantur per `panem' et `aquam' in sequentibus locis: {2} apud Esaiam, 	Ecce Jehovah Zebaoth removens ex Hierosolyma et Jehudah omnem baculum panis, 
et omnem baculum aquae, iii 1; </p>
<p>`baculus panis' pro potentia et vita ex bono, et `baculus aquae' pro potentia et vita ex vero: apud Ezechielem, 	Ecce Ego frangens baculum panis in Hierosolyma, ut 
comedant panem in pondere et in sollicitudine, et aquam {3} in mensura et cum stupore bibant; ut careant pane et aqua, et desolentur vir et frater ejus, et contabescant propter iniquitatem suam, iv 16, 
17; </p>
<p>quod `carere pane et aqua' sit deprivari bono amoris et vero fidei, patet manifeste, nam dicitur ut `desolentur vir et frater ejus, et contabescant propter iniquitatem': pariter apud eundem, 	Panem 
suum cum sollicitudine comedent, et aquas suas cum stupore bibent, ut devastetur terra ejus a plenitudine ejus, propter violentiam omnium habitantium {4} in ea, xii 19: </p>
<p>[3] apud Amos, 	Ecce dies 
venturi quibus immittam famem in terram, non famem ad panem, neque sitim ad aquas, sed ad audiendum verba Jehovae, viii 11: </p>
<p>in Libro Primo Regum, 	Dixit vir Dei ad Jerobeamum, Si dares mihi dimidiam 
domum tuam, non ingredior tecum, nec comederem panem, neque biberem aquam in loco hoc; sic namque praecepit Jehovah, dicendo, Non comedes panem, neque bibes aquam, neque redibis per viam quam ivisti. 
 Sed propheta ex Bethele dixit ad illum, (o)quod dictum a Jehovah, quod {5} comederet secum panem et biberet aquam, mentiendo; et reversus est cum eo, et comedit panem in domo ejus et bibit aquas; 
quapropter discerptus est a leone, xiii 8, 9, 16-19, 24; </p>
<p>{6} quod non ederet panem et biberet aquam apud Jerobeamum, significabat {7} quod abhorresceret bonum ibi et quoque verum, quia erant profanata, 
Jerobeamus enim profanavit altare et omnia sancta cultus, ut patet ab historicis Verbi ibi. 	[4] Defectus boni et veri spiritualis significabatur per quod non data sit pluvia per tres annos et dimidium 
regnante Achabo, usque ut deficeret panis et aqua; et quod tunc abiret Elias ad viduam in Sarepta, et peteret ab illa parum aquae in vase ut biberet, et (x)frustum panis (o)ut ederet, 1 Reg. xvii 
(o)et xviii; per `panem' enim significabatur {8} omne bonum Ecclesiae, et per `aquam' omne verum Ecclesiae, (o)ut supra dictum est; {9} quia eo tempore repraesentabantur talia, ex causa quia repraesentativam 
Ecclesiae erat apud illos, et quia sic per repraesentativa conscriberetur {10} Verbum, etiam historicum, inde erat quod (o)devastatio boni et veri repraesentaretur {11} per defectum panis
