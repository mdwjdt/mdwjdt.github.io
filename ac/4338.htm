Verses 1-3. And Jacob lifted up his eyes and saw, and behold Esau came, and with him four hundred men. And he divided the children over unto Leah, and over unto Rachel, and over unto the two handmaids. 
And he put the handmaids and their children first, and Leah and her children after, and Rachel and Joseph after. And he himself passed over before them, and bowed himself to the earth seven times, 
until he drew near even unto his brother. "And Jacob lifted up his eyes, and saw," signifies the perception and attention of the good of truth, which is "Jacob;" "and behold Esau came," signifies Divine 
good natural; "and with him four hundred men," signifies the state; "and he divided the children over unto Leah," signifies the arrangement of external truths under their affection; "and over unto 
Rachel," signifies the arrangement of interior truths under their affection; "and over unto the two handmaids," signifies under the affection of things that are of service to these affections; "and he 
put the handmaids and their children first, and Leah and her children after, and Rachel and Joseph after," signifies order from the generals in which were the rest; "and he himself passed over before 
them," signifies the universal, thus all things; "and bowed himself to the earth seven times," signifies the submission of all things; "until he drew near even unto his brother," signifies conjunction 
on the part of the good from truth, which is "Jacob." </p>

Verses 1-3 And Jacob lifted up his eyes and saw, and behold, Esau was coming, and four hundred men with him. And he divided the sons over towards Leah, and over towards Rachel, and over towards the two 
servant-girls. And he put the servant-girls and their sons first, and Leah and her sons further back, and Rachel and Joseph even further back. And he himself passed over in front of them, and bowed 
to the ground seven times, until he came right up to his brother. </p>
<p>Jacob lifted up his eyes and saw' means the perception and the attention of the good of truth, meant by 'Jacob'. 'And behold, Esau 
was coming' means Divine Natural Good. 'And four hundred men with him' means a state. 'And he divided the sons over towards Leah' means the deployment of external truths beneath their own specific affection. 
'And over towards Rachel' means the deployment of interior truths beneath their own specific affection. 'And over towards the two servant-girls' means beneath the affection for the things that 
serve those two affections. 'And he put the servant-girls and their sons first, and Leah and her sons further back, and Rachel and Joseph even further back' means an ordering beginning with general 
things in which all else is included. 'And he himself passed over in front of them' means that which is universal, and so means all things. 'And bowed to the ground seven times' means the submission of 
all things. 'Until he came right up to his brother' means a joining on the part of good that develops from truth, meant by 'Jacob'. </p>

Vers. 1-3. Et sustulit Jacob oculos suos et vidit, et ecce Esau venit, et cum eo quadringenti viri; et divisit natos super ad Leam, et super ad Rachelem, et super ad binas ancillas. Et posuit ancillas 
et natos illarum primo, et Leam et natos ejus posteriores, et Rachelem et Josephum posteriores. Et ipse transivit ante illos, et incurvavit se terram septem vicibus, usque appropinquaverit se usque 
ad fratrem suum.  `Sustulit Jacob oculos suos et vidit' significat perceptionem et intentionem veri boni quod `Jacob': `et ecce Esau venit' significat quod Divinum Bonum Naturale: `et cum eo quadringenti 
viri' significat statum: `et divisit natos super ad Leam' significat dispositionem verorum externorum sub affectione sua: `et super ad Rachelem' significat dispositionem verorum interiorum 
sub affectione sua:  et super ad binas ancillas' significat sub affectione illis servientium: `et posuit ancillas et natos illarum primo, et Leam et natos ejus posteriores, et Rachelem et Josephum 
posteriores' significat ordinem a communibus {1} in quibus reliqua: `et ipse transivit ante illos' significat universale, ita omnia: `et incurvavit se terram septem vicibus' significat submissionem 
omnium; `usque appropinquaverit se usque ad fratrem suum' significat conjunctionem a parte boni a vero, quod `Jacob.'      @1 communioribus as 4345$ </p>
