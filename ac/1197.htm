<h3 align="center" class="ired">属天的奥秘 第1197节</h3>
<h4 align="center"></h4><p><strong>1197.</strong>“从他们出来的有非利士人”表出于这些人的民族，该民族表对信与仁的认知之知识。这从圣言中多次提及他们的地方清楚看出来。在古教会，凡大量谈论信，坚称得救在于信，然而却没有信的生活之人都被称为非利士人。因此，比起其他人，他们更适合被称为未受割礼，即缺乏仁爱（关于他们被视为未受割礼的，可参看撒母耳记上<a href="http://39-27.cn/撒上14.6.htm">14:6</a>；<a href="http://39-27.cn/撒上17.26.htm">17:26</a>，<a href="http://39-27.cn/撒上17.36.htm">36</a>；<a href="http://39-27.cn/撒上31.4.htm">31:4</a>；撒母耳记下<a href="http://39-27.cn/撒下1.20.htm">1:20</a>等）。他们因具有这种秉性，故必使信的认知沦为记忆，因为对属灵和属天事物的认知，以及信的奥秘本身因着通晓它们的人缺乏仁爱而变成纯粹的记忆。记忆之物可以说是死物，除非这人能出于良知照着它们生活。当他出于良知照之生活时，记忆之物同时也会成为生活的事务，只有这时它们才会为了他肉身生活后的用和救赎而归于他。知识和认知若没有对他的生活产生任何影响，那么在来世对人来说毫无价值，即便他知道所揭示的一切奥秘。<br />在圣言的整个预言部分，以及历史部分，“非利士人”都表诸如上面所描述的这类人。如，亚伯拉罕寄居在非利士陆地，与非利士的王亚比米勒立约（创世记<a href="http://39-27.cn/创20.1.htm">20:1</a>至末尾；<a href="http://39-27.cn/创21.22.htm">21:22</a>至末尾；<a href="http://39-27.cn/创26.1.htm">26:1</a>-<a href="http://39-27.cn/创26.34.htm">34</a>）。由于非利士人在此表信的认知，亚伯拉罕代表信的属天事物，故他寄居在那里，并与他们立约。以撒同样如此，他代表信的属灵事物。但雅各却没有这样做，因为他代表教会的外在。<br />“非利士人”一般表信之认知的知识，尤表那些将信和得救唯独置于认知之人，他们使这些认知沦为记忆。这一点可见于以赛亚书：<br />非利士全地啊，不要因击打你的杖折断就喜乐。因为从蛇的根必生出毒蛇，它所生的，是火焰的飞龙。（以赛亚书<a href="http://39-27.cn/赛14.29.htm">14:29</a>）<br />此处“蛇的根”表知识；“毒蛇”表基于知识的虚假所产生的邪恶；“它所生的，火焰的飞龙”是指他们的行为，被称为“火焰的飞龙”，因为它们是恶欲的产物。<br />约珥书：<br />推罗、西顿和非利士四境的人哪，你们与我何干？你们要报复我吗？我必使报应速速归到你们的头上。你们既然夺取我的金银，又将我可爱的宝物带入你们的庙宇；并将犹大人和耶路撒冷人卖给雅完人，使他们远离自己的境界。（约珥书<a href="http://39-27.cn/珥3.4.htm">3:4</a>-<a href="http://39-27.cn/珥3.6.htm">6</a>）<br />此处明显可知非利士人，非利士四境的人或它的四境分别表示什么；“金银”在此是指信的属灵和属天之物；“可爱的宝物”是指对它们的认知；他们“将我可爱的宝物带入自己的庙宇”是指他们拥有并宣告它们；他们卖“犹大人和耶路撒冷人”表他们没有爱，也没有信；在圣言中，“犹大”是指信的属天事物，“耶路撒冷”是指由此而来的信之属灵事物，它们被“远离自己的境界”。先知书中还有进一步的例子（如耶利米书<a href="http://39-27.cn/耶25.20.htm">25:20</a>；<a href="http://39-27.cn/耶47.1.htm">47:1</a>至末尾；以西结书<a href="http://39-27.cn/结16.27.htm">16:27</a>，<a href="http://39-27.cn/结16.57.htm">57</a>；<a href="http://39-27.cn/结25.15.htm">25:15</a>-<a href="http://39-27.cn/结25.16.htm">16</a>；阿摩司书<a href="http://39-27.cn/摩1.8.htm">1:8</a>；俄巴底亚书<a href="http://39-27.cn/俄1.19.htm">1:19</a>；西番雅书<a href="http://39-27.cn/番2.5.htm">2:5</a>；诗篇<a href="http://39-27.cn/诗83.7.htm">83:7</a>；<a href="http://39-27.cn/诗87.4.htm">87:4</a>.关于迦斐托人，申命记<a href="http://39-27.cn/申2.23.htm">2:23</a>；耶利米书<a href="http://39-27.cn/耶47.4.htm">47:4</a>；阿摩司书<a href="http://39-27.cn/摩9.7.htm">9:7</a>）。</p>

<p><strong>[NCE]1197.</strong> The fact that from whom the Pelishtim{*1} came means the nation that grew out of this tradition, which in turn symbolizes the knowledge of concepts involved in faith and charity, can be seen in the Word, where the name comes up many times. The ancient church used the label of Philistine for all those who talked and talked about faith and about the idea that salvation is found in faith and yet completely failed to live a life of faith. For this reason, Philistines more than any others were also described as uncircumcised, meaning that they lacked charity. (For passages that refer to them as uncircumcised, see <a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_1197/bible_king-james-version_1-samuel_14_6" target=_top>1 Samuel 14:6</a>; <a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_1197/bible_king-james-version_1-samuel_17_26" target=_top>17:26</a>, <a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_1197/bible_king-james-version_1-samuel_17_36" target=_top>36</a>; <a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_1197/bible_king-james-version_1-samuel_31_4" target=_top>31:4</a>; <a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_1197/bible_king-james-version_2-samuel_1_20" target=_top>2 Samuel 1:20</a>; and other places.)<br />These people by nature could not help turning religious knowledge into a matter of memorization. The knowledge of spiritual and heavenly realities and even the mysteries of faith become nothing more than objects of memory when the people who are adept at them have no love for others.<br />Memorized details are dead objects to us unless we live according to them as a matter of conscience. When we do, then as soon as something becomes part of our memory it also becomes part of our life. That is when it first becomes something in us that remains useful to us and our salvation after physical life ends. Neither secular nor religious knowledge means anything to us in the other life — even if we have learned all the secrets that have ever been revealed — unless it permeates our life.<br />[2] In the prophetic parts of the Word, Philistines always symbolize this kind of people, as they do in the narrative parts too. One example is Abraham's stay in the Philistines' land and the fact that he struck a pact with Abimelech, king of the Philistines (<a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_1197/bible_king-james-version_genesis_20_1-18" target=_top>Genesis 20</a>} ; <a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_1197/bible_king-james-version_genesis_21_22" target=_top>21:22</a>-end; <a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_1197/bible_king-james-version_genesis_26_1-33" target=_top>26:1-33</a>). Since the Philistines symbolized the concepts of faith and Abraham represented the heavenly aspects of faith, he stayed in their land and entered into a pact with them. Isaac, who represented the spiritual aspects of faith, did something similar. But Jacob did not, because he represented the surface aspects of the church.<br />[3] Philistines in general symbolize the knowledge of religious concepts and in particular those who place faith and salvation in knowledge alone, which they turn into memorized information. This can be seen in Isaiah:<br />Do not rejoice through and through, Philistia, that the rod striking you has been broken, because from the root of a snake a cockatrice will come out, and its fruit will be a flying fire snake.{*2} (<a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_1197/bible_king-james-version_isaiah_14_29" target=_top>Isaiah 14:29</a>)<br />The root of a snake stands for facts, and a cockatrice, for evil rising out of falsity based on those facts. The fruit that is a flying fire snake means the deeds of those people; and the deeds are referred to as a flying fire snake because they result from cravings.<br />[4] In Joel:<br />What are you to me, Tyre and Sidon and all you borders of Philistia? Are you repaying me with retribution? I will very speedily bring your retribution back onto your own head, because my silver and my gold you have stolen, and my good, desirable things you have taken into your temples, and the children of Judah and the children of Jerusalem you have sold to the children of the Javanites,{*3} in order to make them go far away from their own border. (<a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_1197/bible_king-james-version_joel_3_4-5" target=_top>Joel 3:4-5</a>, <a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_1197/bible_king-james-version_joel_3_6" target=_top>6</a>)<br />The meaning of the Philistines and of the whole of Philistia (all its borders) is plain. The silver and gold mentioned mean spiritual and heavenly qualities of faith. Good, desirable things mean knowledge of those qualities. The taking of these items into the Philistines' temples means that they had that knowledge and preached it. But they sold the children of Judah and the children of Jerusalem, which means that they had no love and no faith. Judah in the Word is the heavenly side of faith, while Jerusalem is the spiritual side of it that develops out of the heavenly side, and these were removed far from their own borders. There are other passages in the prophets too, such as <a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_1197/bible_king-james-version_jeremiah_25_20" target=_top>Jeremiah 25:20</a>; <a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_1197/bible_king-james-version_ezekiel_47_1-7" target=_top>47:1-end</a>; <a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_1197/bible_king-james-version_ezekiel_16_27" target=_top>Ezekiel 16:27</a>, <a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_1197/bible_king-james-version_ezekiel_16_57" target=_top>57</a>; <a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_1197/bible_king-james-version_ezekiel_25_15-16" target=_top>25:15-16</a>; <a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_1197/bible_king-james-version_amos_1_8" target=_top>Amos 1:8</a>; Obadiah verse <a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_1197/bible_king-james-version_obadiah_1_19" target=_top>19</a>; <a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_1197/bible_king-james-version_zephaniah_2_5" target=_top>Zephaniah 2:5</a>; <a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_1197/bible_king-james-version_psalms_87_3-4" target=_top>Psalms 87:3-4</a>.<br />For passages about the people of Caphtor, see <a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_1197/bible_king-james-version_deuteronomy_2_23" target=_top>Deuteronomy 2:23</a>; <a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_1197/bible_king-james-version_jeremiah_47_4" target=_top>Jeremiah 47:4</a>; <a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_1197/bible_king-james-version_amos_9_7" target=_top>Amos 9:7</a>.<br /><br /><strong>Footnotes:</strong><br />{*1} On "Pelishtim," meaning Philistines, see note 4 in <a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_1197/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_1130" target=_top>1130</a>.

From whom went forth the Pelistim [Philistines]. That this signifies a nation thence derived, and that by this nation is signified a mere memory-knowledge of the knowledges of faith and charity, is evident 
from the Word, where the Philistines are frequently mentioned. In the Ancient Church all those were called Philistines who talked much about faith, and declared that salvation is in faith, and 
yet had no life of faith. Therefore they preeminently were called "the uncircumcised," which means those who are devoid of charity. That they were called "the uncircumcised" may be seen in 1 Sam. 14:6; 
17:26, 36; 31:4; 2 Sam. 1:20, and in other places. Because they were such, they could not but make the knowledges of faith matters of memory; for the knowledges of spiritual and celestial things and 
the very mysteries of faith themselves become nothing but matters of memory, when the man who is skilled in them is devoid of charity. The things of the memory are like things dead unless the man is 
such that from conscience he lives according to them. When he does this, then at the same time as they are things of memory they are also things of life; and only then do they remain with him for his 
use and salvation after the life of the body. Knowledges [scientiae et cognitiones] are nothing to a man in the other life, even though he may have known all the arcana that have ever been revealed, unless 
they have affected his life. [2] Such [as those described above] are everywhere signified by "Philistines" in the prophetical parts of the Word, and also in the historical, as for example, when 
Abraham sojourned in the land of the Philistines, and made a covenant with Abimelech, the king of the Philistines (Gen. 20:1 to the end; 21:22 to the end; 26:1-34). As the knowledges of faith are here 
signified by the Philistines, Abraham, because he represented the celestial things of faith, sojourned there, and entered into a covenant with them; and likewise Isaac, by whom were represented the 
spiritual things of faith; but not Jacob, because by him the externals of the church were represented.  [3] That the "Philistines" signify in general a mere memory-knowledge of the knowledges of faith, 
and specifically those who make faith and salvation consist in knowledges alone, which they make matters of memory, may be seen in Isaiah: </p>
<p>     Rejoice not thou whole Philistia, because the rod that 
smote thee is broken; for out of the serpent's root shall come forth a basilisk, and his fruit shall be like a fiery flying serpent (Isa. 14:29). Here "the root of the serpent" denotes memory-knowledges; 
"the basilisk," evil from the derivative falsity; and "the fruit of a fiery flying serpent," is their works, which are called "a fiery flying serpent" because they come of cupidities.  [4] In 
Joel: </p>
<p>     What are ye to Me, O Tyre, and Zidon, and all the borders of Philistia? Will ye render a recompense upon Me? very speedily will I return your recompense upon your own head. Inasmuch as ye 
have taken My silver and My gold, and have carried into your temples My desirable good things; the sons also of Judah and the sons of Jerusalem have ye sold unto the sons of the Javanites, that ye might 
cause them to remove far from their border (Joel 3:4-6). Here it is evident what is meant by the Philistines, and by "all Philistia," or all "the borders" of it. "Silver and gold" here are the spiritual 
and celestial things of faith; "desirable good things" are the knowledges of them. That they "carried them into their temples," is that they possessed and proclaimed them; and that they "sold 
the sons of Judah and the sons of Jerusalem," signifies that they had no love and no faith; "Judah" in the Word is the celestial of faith, and "Jerusalem" is the spiritual of faith thence derived, which 
were "removed far from their borders." So also in other places in the Prophets, as in Jer. 25:20; 47:1 to the end; Ezek. 16:27, 57; 25:15-16; Amos 1:8; Obad. 19; Zeph. 2:5; Ps. 83:7; 87:4. And concerning 
the Caphtorim in Deut. 2:23; Jer. 47:4; Amos 9:7. </p>

<p align="center"><b>Elliott(1983-1999) 1197</b></p><p><b>1197.</b>
'From whom Pelishtim came forth' means the nation which came from these, and which means a knowledge of the cognitions of faith and charity. This is clear from the Word where they are mentioned many 
times. In the Ancient Church all were called Philistines who spoke much about faith and who asserted that salvation lay in faith, and yet possessed nothing of the life of faith. Consequently they more 
than any others were called uncircumcised, that is, devoid of charity. (For references to them as the uncircumcised, see <a href="http://bible.gospelcom.net/cgi-bin/bible?passage=1%20Sam%2014:6;%2017:26,%2036;%2031:4;%202&amp;version=ESV&amp;interface=print&amp;showfn=yes&amp;showxref">1 Sam 14:6; 17:26, 36; 31:4; 2</a> <a href="http://bible.gospelcom.net/cgi-bin/bible?passage=Sam%201:20&amp;version=ESV&amp;interface=print&amp;showfn=yes&amp;showxref">Sam 1:20</a>; and elsewhere.) Being such as they 
were they inevitably made cognitions of faith matters of memory, for cognitions of spiritual and celestial things, and the arcana of faith themselves, become purely matters of memory when a person who 
is acquainted with them is devoid of charity. Things of the memory are so to speak dead if the person is not such that he lives according to them from conscience. When he does live according to them 
from conscience things of the memory are in that case matters of life as well, and only then do they remain with him for his use and salvation following life in the body. Knowledge and cognitions are 
of no value to anyone in the next life, even though he may have known all the arcana that have ever been revealed, if they have made no impact on his life. </p>
<p></p>
<p><b>[2]</b>
 Throughout the prophetical parts of the 
Word 'the Philistines' means people such as these, as they do in the historical sections of the Word, as when Abraham sojourned in the land of the Philistines and made a covenant with Abimelech, the 
king of the Philistines, <a href="http://bible.gospelcom.net/cgi-bin/bible?passage=Gen%2020:1-end;%2021:22-end;%2026:1-33&amp;version=ESV&amp;interface=print&amp;showfn=yes&amp;showxref">Gen 20:1-end; 21:22-end; 26:1-33</a>. Because the Philistines here meant cognitions of faith, and because Abraham represented the celestial things of faith, he sojourned there 
and made a covenant with them. So likewise did Isaac, who represented the spiritual things of faith. But Jacob did not do so because he represented the external features of the Church. </p>
<p></p>
<p><b>[3]</b>
 That 'the 
Philistines' means, in general, knowledge of the cognitions of faith, and in particular people who make faith and salvation reside in cognitions alone which they make matters of memory, becomes clear 
also in Isaiah, </p>
<blockquote>
Rejoice not, O Philistia, all of you, that the rod which smites you has been broken, for from the serpent's root will come forth an adder, and its fruit will be a flying prester. 
<a href="http://bible.gospelcom.net/cgi-bin/bible?passage=Isa%2014:29&amp;version=ESV&amp;interface=print&amp;showfn=yes&amp;showxref">Isa 14:29</a> 
</blockquote>
<p>Here 'the serpent's root' stands for facts, 'an adder' for evil arising out of falsities based on facts. 'The fruits of a flying prester' is their works which, because they are the product 
of evil desires, are called 'a flying prester' </p>
<p></p>
<p><b>[4]</b>
 In Joel, </p>
<blockquote>
What are you to Me, O Tyre and Sidon, and all the borders of Philistia? Are you rendering Me a recompense? Swiftly and speedily I will 
return your recompense upon your own head, inasmuch as you have taken My silver and My gold, and My good and desirable treasures you have carried into your temples, and have sold the sons of Judah 
and the sons of Jerusalem to the sons of the Javanites,<A name="fntext1"></a><A href="#fn1"><sup>a</sup></a> that you might remove them far away from their border. <a href="http://bible.gospelcom.net/cgi-bin/bible?passage=Joel%203:4-6&amp;version=ESV&amp;interface=print&amp;showfn=yes&amp;showxref">Joel 3:4-6</a>. 
</blockquote>
<p>What 'the Philistines' and the whole of Philistia, or 'all its borders', 
are used to mean here is plain. 'Silver' and 'gold' here are the spiritual and celestial things of faith, 'good and desirable treasures' cognitions of them. 'They carried them into their temples' means 
that they were in possession of them and proclaimed them. 'They sold the sons of Judah and the sons of Jerusalem' however means that they possessed no love and no faith. In the Word 'Judah' is the 
celestial element of faith, and 'Jerusalem' the spiritual element deriving from it, which were 'removed far away from their borders'. Further examples exist in the Prophets, such as <a href="http://bible.gospelcom.net/cgi-bin/bible?passage=Jer%2025:20;%2047:1-end&amp;version=ESV&amp;interface=print&amp;showfn=yes&amp;showxref">Jer 25:20; 47:1-end</a>;

'Ex quibus egressi sunt Pelishtim':  quod significent gentem quae inde, et quod per eam significetur scientia cognitionum fidei et charitatis, constat ex Verbo ubi pluries nominantur; Philistaei in 
Antiqua Ecclesia vocati sunt omnes illi qui multum locuti sunt de fide, et quod in fide salus, et tamen nullam vitam fidei habuerunt, quare etiam prae ceteris vocati sunt praeputiati, hoc est, absque 
charitate; quod dicti praeputiati, videatur 1 Sam. xiv 6; xvii 26, 36 xxxi 4; 2 Sam. i 20, et alibi; iidem quia tales, non potuerunt aliter quam cognitiones fidei facere res memoriae; nam cognitiones 
rerum:  spiritualium et caelestium, ipsaque arcana fidei, non fiunt aliter quam res memoriae cum homo qui eas callet, absque charitate est:  res memoriae sunt sicut res mortuae nisi homo sit talis ut 
vivat secundum illas ex conscientia; cum hoc, tunc simul ac sunt res memoriae, etiam sunt res vitae, et tunc primum apud eum sunt ei post vitam corporis usui et saluti; scientiae et cognitiones nihil 
sunt apud hominem in altera vita, etiamsi sciverit omnia arcana quae usquam revelata sunt, nisi imbuerint vitam:  [2]Per 'Philistaeos' in propheticis Verbi ubivis significantur tales, etiam in historicis 
Verbi, ut quod  Abrahamus peregrinatus sit in terra Philistaeorum, et cum Abimelecho rege Philistaeorum foedus pepigerit, Gen. xx 1 ad fin.; xxi 22 ad fin.; xxvi I, (x)33; </p>
<p>ibi quia per 'Philistaeos' 
significatae sunt cognitiones fidei, 'Abrahamus' quia repraesentabat caelestia fidei, ibi peregrinatus est et cum illis foedus iniit; similiter 'Isacus,' per quem repraesentata sunt spiritualia fidei; 
non autem 'Jacobus' quia per eum externa Ecclesiae repraesentata sunt.  [3]Quod 'Philistaei' significent in genere scientiam cognitionum fidei et in specie eos qui fidem et salutem in solis cognitionibus 
ponunt, quas faciunt res memoriae, constare quoque potest apud Esaiam, Ne laeteris Philistaea tota tu, quod fracta sit virga percutiens te, nam de radice serpentis exibit regulus et fructus 
ejus prester volans, xiv 29; </p>
<p>ubi 'radix serpentis' pro scientificis, 'regulus' pro malo ex falso inde, 'fructus prester volans' sunt opera eorum quae quia sunt cupiditatum, vocantur 'prester volans': 
 apud Joelem, [4]Quid vos Mihi, Tyre et Zidon, et omnes termini Philistaeae?  num retributionem vos rependentes super Me?  ...cito valde reducam retributionem vestram in caput vestrum; propterea quod 
argentum Meum, et aurum Meum sumpsistis, et desiderabilia Mea bona intulistis in templa vestra, et filios Jehudae et filios Hierosolymae vendidistis filiis Javanimorum, propterea ut elongare faceretis 
eos desuper termino eorum, iv 4-6 [A.V. iii 4-6]; </p>
<p>ibi quid per Philistaeos, perque totam Philistaeam seu omnes terminos ejus, intelligitur, patet; 'argentum et aurum' ibi sunt spiritualia et caelestia 
fidei; 'desiderabilia bona' sunt cognitiones illorum; quod 'intulerint in templa sua' est quod habuerint et praedicaverint illa; at '[quod] filios Jehudae et filios Hierosolymae vendiderint' est 
quod nullum amorem et nullam fidem habuerint; 'Jehudas' est in Verbo caeleste fidei, 'Hierosolyma' spirituale fidei inde, quae longe remota a terminis eorum:  praeter alibi apud Prophetas, ut apud Jer. 
xxv 20; xlvii 1 ad fin.; Ezech. xvi 27, 57; xxv 15, 16; Amos. i 8; Obad. 19; Zeph. (x)ii 5; Ps. (x)lxxxvii 4; de Caphtoraeis, Deut. ii 23; Jer. xlvii 4; Amos. ix 7. </p>
