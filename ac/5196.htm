<h3 align="center" class="ired">属天的奥秘 第5196节</h3>
<h4 align="center"></h4><p><strong>5196.</strong>“看哪，自己站在河边”表从边界到边界。这从“河”的含义清楚可知，“河”（此处即埃及河，或尼罗河）是指边界。“河”之所以表示边界，是因为主要的河流，即幼发拉底河，约旦河，尼罗河，加上海是迦南地最远的边界。由于迦南地本身代表主的国度，因而迦南地所有地方都代表该国度的各种事物，所以河流代表它的最远或最终的界限或边界（参看<a href="1866.htm">1866</a>，<a href="4116.htm">4116</a>，<a href="4240.htm">4240</a>节）。尼罗河，或埃及河代表受心智的理解力部分支配的感官印象，因而代表从这些印象所获得的记忆知识；因为记忆知识是主国度的属灵事物的最终界限。在此之所以表示从边界到边界，是因为经上论及法老说：他“站在河边”；而法老代表总体上的属世层（<a href="5160.htm">5160</a>节）。从内在直到最终的外在界限来观看事物由“站在河边”来代表，这是灵界的情形。由于此时这种观看从边界延伸到边界，所以这就是这些话在内义上所表示的。</p>

<p align="center"><b>Potts(1905-1910) 5196</b></p><p><b>5196.</b>
And behold he stood by the river. That this signifies from boundary to boundary, is evident from the signification of a "river," here the river of Egypt or the Nile, as being a boundary. A "river" signifies 
a boundary because the great rivers-the Euphrates, the Jordan, and the Nile-and withal the sea, were the farthest boundaries of the land of Canaan; and as the land of Canaan itself represented 
the Lord's kingdom, and hence all the places in it represented various things in this kingdom, the rivers consequently represented the farthest limits or boundaries of it (see n. 1866, 4116, 4240). The 
Nile, or river of Egypt, represented the sensuous things subject to the intellectual part, thus the memory-knowledges derived from them; for these are the ultimates of the spiritual things of the Lord's 
kingdom. That from boundary to boundary is signified here, is because it is said of Pharaoh that he "stood by the river;" for by Pharaoh is represented the natural in general (n. 5160). To view 
anything from what is interior down to the ultimate is represented by standing beside the ultimate, as is the case in the spiritual world; and because there is then a view from boundary to boundary, therefore 
in the internal sense this is what is signified by these words. </p>

<p align="center"><b>Elliott(1983-1999) 5196</b></p><p><b>5196.</b>
'And behold, he was standing next to the river' means from boundary to boundary. This is clear from the meaning of 'the river' - which in this case is the River of Egypt, or the Nile - as a boundary. 
The reason 'the river' means a boundary is that the major rivers, the Euphrates, the Jordan, and the Nile, and besides these the sea, were the final boundaries of the land of Canaan. Because the land 
of Canaan itself represented the Lord's kingdom, and all locations in that land therefore represented various features of that kingdom, the rivers accordingly represented its final limits or boundaries, 
see <a href="1866.htm">1866</a>, <a href="4116.htm">4116</a>, <a href="4240.htm">4240</a>. The Nile or River of Egypt represented sensory impressions subject to the understanding part of the mind and so represented factual knowledge gained from those impressions; for 
that factual knowledge is the final limit of spiritual things that belong to the Lord's kingdom. The reason why from boundary to boundary is meant is that, referring to Pharaoh, it says 'he was standing 
next to the river'; and 'Pharaoh' represents the natural in general, <a href="5160.htm">5160</a>. Viewing something from within through to its final outward limit is represented by 'standing next to the river', as happens 
in the spiritual world. And because in the present context such a view extends from boundary to boundary, that is what is therefore meant in the internal sense. </p>

</p><b>5196.</b>
`Et ecce stans juxta fluvium': quod significet a termino ad terminum, constat ex significatione `fluvii', hic fluvii Aegypti seu Nili, quod sit terminus; quod `fluvius' sit terminus, est quia fluvii 
magni, nempe Euphrates, Jordanes et Nilus, ac insuper mare, erant termini ultimi terrae Canaanis, et quia ipsa terra Canaan repraesentabat regnum Domini, et inde omnia loca ibi repraesentabant varia 
in illo regno, {1}consequenter `fluvii' repraesentabant ultima seu terminos ibi, videatur n. 1866, 4116, 4240; `Nilus' seu fluvius Aegypti repraesentabat sensualia parti intellectuali subjecta, ita scientifica 
quae ex illis, nam haec sunt ultima spiritualium regni Domini. Quod a termino ad terminum significetur, est quia dicitur de Pharaone quod `is stans juxta fluvium'; per `Pharaonem' enim repraesentatur 
naturale in   communi, n. 5160; prospicere aliquid ab interiore usque ad ultimum repraesentatur per `stare juxta ultimum', ita fit in mundo spirituali; et quia tunc a termino ad terminum prospicitur, 
idcirco id per illa verba in sensu interno significatur. @1 ita$ </p>
