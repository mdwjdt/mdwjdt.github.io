<h3 align="center" class="ired">属天的奥秘 第9373节</h3>
<h4 align="center"></h4><p><strong>9373.</strong>“都要上到耶和华这里来”表与主的结合。这从“上来”的含义清楚可知，“上来”是指被提升到内层事物（参看<a href="3084.htm">3084</a>，<a href="4539.htm">4539</a>，<a href="4969.htm">4969</a>，<a href="5406.htm">5406</a>，<a href="5817.htm">5817</a>，<a href="6007.htm">6007</a>节），因此也指与它们结合（<a href="8760.htm">8760</a>节）。它之所以是指与主的结合，是因为在圣言中，“耶和华”表示主（<a href="1343.htm">1343</a>，<a href="1736.htm">1736</a>，<a href="1793.htm">1793</a>，<a href="2004.htm">2004</a>，<a href="2005.htm">2005</a>，<a href="2018.htm">2018</a>，<a href="2025.htm">2025</a>，<a href="2921.htm">2921</a>，<a href="3023.htm">3023</a>，<a href="3035.htm">3035</a>，<a href="5663.htm">5663</a>，<a href="6280.htm">6280</a>，<a href="6303.htm">6303</a>，<a href="6905.htm">6905</a>，<a href="8274.htm">8274</a>，<a href="8864.htm">8864</a>，<a href="9315.htm">9315</a>节）。这些话的内义里面还藏着一个奥秘，即：立摩西为其头领的雅各子孙并不是被召或被选的；相反，是他们自己坚持认为神性敬拜应在他们当中建立，正如前面所述（<a href="4290.htm">4290</a>，<a href="4293.htm">4293</a>节）。这就是为何经上说，“祂对摩西说，上到耶和华这里来”，就好像不是耶和华，而是别人吩咐他上来。由于同样的原因，经上随后说“百姓不可上来”（24:2）；“耶和华不把手伸在分别出来的以色列人身上”（24:11）；“耶和华荣耀的景象在山顶上，在以色列人眼前，就像吞噬的烈火” （24:17）；最后说，摩西在第七天被呼召，“进入云中”（24: 16，18）。因为“云”表示字面上的圣言（<a href="5922.htm">5922</a>，<a href="6343.htm">6343</a>e，<a href="6752.htm">6752</a>，<a href="6832.htm">6832</a>，<a href="8106.htm">8106</a>，<a href="8443.htm">8443</a>，<a href="8781.htm">8781</a>节）；在雅各的子孙当中，圣言与它的内义是分离的，因为他们的敬拜是外在的，没有任何内在之物。这一点从以下事实清楚看出来：他们现在和以前一样（出埃及记<a href="http://39-27.cn/出19.8.htm">19:8</a>）声称：“耶和华所说的一切话，我们都必遵行”（24:3），然而，此后不到四十天，他们就敬拜金牛犊，而不是耶和华。由此明显可知，这种偶像崇拜就藏在他们心里，虽然他们口口声声说他们唯独事奉耶和华。然而，被召的和被拣选的所表示的人是那些处于内在敬拜，并通过内在敬拜而处于外在敬拜的人；也就是说，是那些处于对主的爱和信，并由此处于对邻之爱的人。</p>

Come up unto Jehovah. That this signifies conjunction with the Lord, is evident from the signification of "coming up," as being to be raised toward interior things (see n. 3084, 4539, 4969, 5406, 5817, 
6007), consequently also to be conjoined (n. 8760). That it denotes conjunction with the Lord, is because by "Jehovah" in the Word is meant the Lord (n. 1343, 1736, 1793, 2004, 2005, 2018, 2025, 2921, 
3023, 3035, 5663, 6280, 6303, 6905, 8274, 8864, 9315). A secret which also lies hidden in the internal sense of these words, is that the sons of Jacob, over whom Moses was the head, were not called 
and chosen; but they themselves insisted that Divine worship should be instituted among them (according to what has been said in n. 4290, 4293); and therefore it is here said, "and He said unto Moses, 
Come up unto Jehovah," as if not Jehovah, but another, had said that he should come up. For the same reason in what follows it is said that "the people should not go up" (verse 2); and that "Jehovah 
sent not His hand unto the sons of Israel who were set apart" (verse 11); and that "the appearance of the glory of Jehovah was like devouring fire on the top of the mountain in the eyes of the sons 
of Israel" (verse 17); and lastly that Moses, being called the seventh day, "entered into the midst of the cloud." For by "the cloud" is meant the Word in the letter (n. 5922, 6343, 6752, 6832, 8106, 
8443, 8781); and with the sons of Jacob the Word was separated from its internal sense, because they were in external worship without internal, as can be clearly seen from the fact that now, as before, 
they said, "all the words which Jehovah hath spoken we will do" (verse 3); and yet scarcely forty days afterward they worshiped a golden calf instead of Jehovah; which shows that this was hidden in 
their hearts while they were saying with their lips that they would serve Jehovah alone. But nevertheless those who are meant by "the called and the chosen" are those who are in internal worship, and 
who from internal worship are in external; that is, those who are in love to and faith in the Lord, and from this in love toward the neighbor. </p>

'Come up to Jehovah' means being joined to the Lord. This is clear from the meaning of 'coming up' as being raised to more internal things, dealt with in <a href="3084.htm">3084</a>, <a href="4539.htm">4539</a>, <a href="4969.htm">4969</a>, <a href="5406.htm">5406</a>, <a href="5817.htm">5817</a>, <a href="6007.htm">6007</a>, and therefore 
also being joined to them, <a href="8760.htm">8760</a>. The reason why it is a joining to the Lord is that 'Jehovah' in the Word means the Lord, <a href="1343.htm">1343</a>, <a href="1736.htm">1736</a>, <a href="1793.htm">1793</a>, <a href="2004.htm">2004</a>, <a href="2005.htm">2005</a>, <a href="2018.htm">2018</a>, <a href="2025.htm">2025</a>, <a href="2921.htm">2921</a>, <a href="3023.htm">3023</a>, <a href="3035.htm">3035</a>, <a href="5663.htm">5663</a>, <a href="6280.htm">6280</a>, <a href="6281.htm">6281</a>, <a href="6303.htm">6303</a>, <a href="6905.htm">6905</a>, <a href="8274.htm">8274</a>, <a href="8864.htm">8864</a>, <a href="9315.htm">9315</a>. A further arcanum which lies concealed within the internal sense of these words is that the children of Jacob, over whom Moses presided as their head, were not called 
or elected; rather, they themselves insisted that Divine worship should be established among them, as accords with what has been stated in <a href="4290.htm">4290</a>, <a href="4293.htm">4293</a>. This is why it says, And He said to Moses, Come 
up to Jehovah, as though not Jehovah but another was telling him to go up. For the same reason it says in what follows that the people should not come up, verse 2, and that Jehovah did not lay a hand 
on the children of Israel who had been set apart, verse 11; also that the sight of Jehovah's glory was like a consuming fire on the top of the mountain in the eyes of the children of Israel, verse 17; 
and finally that Moses, when he was called on the seventh day, went into the middle of the cloud, [verses 16,18.] 'The cloud' means the Word in the letter, <a href="5922.htm">5922</a>, <a href="6343.htm">6343</a> (end), <a href="6752.htm">6752</a>, <a href="6832.htm">6832</a>, <a href="8106.htm">8106</a>, <a href="8443.htm">8443</a>, 
<a href="8781.htm">8781</a>; and among the children of Jacob it was the Word separated from its internal sense, since their worship was external devoid of anything internal. This becomes perfectly clear from the fact that they 
now said, as they had done before [at <a href="http://bible.gospelcom.net/cgi-bin/bible?passage=Exod%2019:8&amp;version=ESV&amp;interface=print&amp;showfn=yes&amp;showxref">Exod 19:8</a>], All the words which Jehovah has spoken we will do, verse 3; yet scarcely forty days went by after this time and they were worshipping the golden 
calf instead of Jehovah. From this it is evident that such idolatry lay concealed in their heart when they said with their lips that they would serve Jehovah alone. However, the people who are meant by 
the called and the elect are those with whom internal worship exists, and also external worship springing from internal, that is, those with whom love to the Lord and faith in Him, and consequently 
love towards the neighbour are present.  </p>

`Ascende ad Jehovam': quod significet conjunctionem cum Domino, constat ex significatione `ascendere' quod sit elevari versus interiora, de qua n. 3084, 4539, 4969, 5406, 5817, 6007, et inde quoque 
conjungi, n. 8760; quod sit cum Domino, est quia per `Jehovam' in Verbo intelligitur Dominus, n. 1343, 1736, 1793, 2004, 2005, 2018, 2025, 2921, 3023, 3035, 5663, 6280, (a)6281, 6303, 6905, 8274, 8864, 
9315. Arcanum quod in sensu interno horum verborum etiam latet est quod filii Jacobi, quibus ut caput praeerat Moscheh, non vocati et electi sint, sed quod institerint ipsi ut cultus Divinus apud illos 
(x)institueretur, secundum illa quae n. 4290, 4293, dicta sunt; quare dicitur, Et ad Moschen dixit, Ascende ad Jehovam, sicut non Jehovah sed alius dixerit quod ascenderet; ob eandem causam in sequentibus 
dicitur quod populus non ascenderet, vers. 2, et quod {1}Jehovah non ad sepositos filios Israelis miserit manum suam, vers. 11, tum quod aspectus gloriae Jehovae fuerit sicut ignis comedens in 
capite montis oculis filiorum Israelis, vers. 17, et tandem quod Moscheh {2}die septimo vocatus intraverit in medium nubis; per `nubem' enim intelligitur Verbum in littera, n. 5922, 6343 fin., (a)6752, 
6832, 8106, 8443, 8781, et apud filios Jacobi {3}erat Verbum separatum a sensu {4}suo interno, erant enim in cultu externo absque interno; quod manifeste constare potest ex eo quod nunc sicut prius 
dixerint, Omnia verba quae locutus Jehovah faciemus, vers. 3, et tamen vix praeterlapsi sunt quadraginta dies post hoc tempus, cum vitulum aureum pro Jehovah coluerunt; unde patet quod hoc in corde 
{5}eorum latuerit cum ore dicebant quod Jehovae soli servirent; cum tamen qui {6}per vocatos et electos intelliguntur (x)sunt illi qui in interno cultu sunt, et ab interno in externo, hoc est, qui in 
amore et in fide {7}in Dominum, et inde in amore erga proximum {8}sunt. @1 Dominus$ @2 i cum$ @3 id$ @4 ejus$ @5 latuerit apud illos, cum ore dixerunt$ @6 vocati et electi dicuntur$ @7 i cordis$ @8
