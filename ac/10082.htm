<h3 align="center" class="ired">属天的奥秘 第10082节</h3>
<h4 align="center"></h4><p><strong>10082</strong>.“把这一切都放在亚伦的手掌上和他儿子的手掌上”表天堂里对这些事物属于并来自主的承认。这从“一切”和“手掌”的含义，以及“亚伦和他儿子”的代表清楚可知：“一切”，就是取自公绵羊的所有部位，即脂肪、肾、右胁，和筐内所盛的一切，即饼、糕饼、薄饼，是指神性良善和神性真理，它们属于主，因为它们来自主，如前所述（参看<a href="10070.htm">10070</a>-<a href="10080.htm">10080</a>节）；“手掌”是指那些来自人自己的能力的事物，因而是指人自己的东西，如下文所述；“亚伦和他儿子”是指神性良善和从这良善发出的神性真理方面的主（<a href="9806.htm">9806</a>，<a href="9807.htm">9807</a>，<a href="10017.htm">10017</a>节）。之所以“手掌”表示那些来自人自己的能力的事物，“放在手掌上”表示对这一切事物属于主并来自主的承认，是因为手掌是手的一部分，“手”表示能力，“放在手掌上”表示归与，因而表示承认（译注：另一英文版本，将某个事物归与，因而承认它的物主身份）。因为经上接下来说它们要在手掌上摇一摇，以此表示由此而来的来自神的生命；来自神的生命通过信被赐下，其第一个阶段就是承认。由于“手”表示能力，故可推知，“手掌”表示完全的能力，因为手掌是全握的手。因此，当手掌论及主和从祂的神性良善发出的神性真理时，如此处，所表示的是全能。由此明显可知，“放在亚伦和他儿子的手掌上”表示对主的全能，因而对一切事物属于祂，因为天堂里的一切事物都来自祂的承认。“手”表示能力（参看<a href="4931.htm">4931</a>-<a href="4937.htm">4937</a>，<a href="5327.htm">5327</a>，<a href="5328.htm">5328</a>，<a href="6947.htm">6947</a>，<a href="7188.htm">7188</a>，<a href="7189.htm">7189</a>，<a href="7518.htm">7518</a>节）；“手”和“右手”当论及主时，表示全能（<a href="3387.htm">3387</a>，<a href="4592.htm">4592</a>，<a href="4933.htm">4933</a>，<a href="7518.htm">7518</a>，<a href="7673.htm">7673</a>，<a href="8050.htm">8050</a>，<a href="8153.htm">8153</a>，<a href="8281.htm">8281</a>，<a href="9133.htm">9133</a>节）；从主的神性良善发出的神性真理拥有一切能力（<a href="6948.htm">6948</a>，<a href="8200.htm">8200</a>，<a href="9327.htm">9327</a>，<a href="9410.htm">9410</a>，<a href="9639.htm">9639</a>，<a href="10019.htm">10019</a>节）。</p>

And thou shalt put all upon the palms of Aaron, and upon the palms of his sons. That this signifies the acknowledgment in the heavens that these things are of the Lord and from the Lord, is evident from 
the signification of "all" that was from the ram, as the fat, the kidneys, and the right hind quarter, and of "all" that was in the basket, as the bread, the cake, and the wafer, as being the Divine 
goods and Divine truths which are of the Lord because from the Lord (on which see n. 10070-10080); and from the signification of "the palms," as being those things which are from one's own power, thus 
one's own (of which below); and from the representation of Aaron and his sons, as being the Lord as to Divine good and the Divine truth thence proceeding (n. 9806, 9807, 10017). That "the palms" denote 
those things which are from one's own power, and hence that to be "put upon the palms" denotes the acknowledgment that all these things are of the Lord and from the Lord, is because the palms belong 
to the hands, and by the "hands" is signified power, and "to put upon them" denotes to ascribe, thus to acknowledge; for it is said that they were to be "waved upon them," by which is signified life 
thence from the Divine, and life from the Divine is given through faith, the first of which is acknowledgment. As by the "hands" is signified power, it follows that by the "palms of the hands" is 
signified full power, because the palms grasp fully; hence when the palms are predicated of the Lord, and of the Divine truth proceeding from His Divine good, as here, omnipotence is signified. From this 
it is plain that by "putting upon the palms of Aaron and his sons" is signified the acknowledgment of the Lord's omnipotence, thus that all things are His, because all things in the heavens are from 
Him. (That the "hands" denote power, see n. 4931-4937, 5327, 5328, 6947, 7188, 7189, 7518; that "hand" and "right hand," when said of the Lord, denote omnipotence, n. 3387, 4592, 4933, 7518, 7673, 
8050, 8153, 8281, 9133; and that the Divine truth proceeding from the Lord's Divine good has all power, n. 6948, 8200, 9327, 9410, 9639, 10019.) </p>

'And you shall put all these on Aaron's palms and on the palms of his sons' means acknowledgement in the heavens that those things belong to and come from the Lord. This is clear from the meaning of 
all the parts taken from the ram - the fat, kidneys, and right flank - and all that was contained in the basket, namely the bread, cakes, and wafers, as forms of Divine Good and Divine Truth, which belong 
to the Lord because they come from the Lord, dealt with in <a href="10070.htm">10070</a>-<a href="10080.htm">10080</a>; from the meaning of 'the palms' as things that come from one's own power, thus that which is properly one's own, dealt with 
below; and from the representation of 'Aaron and his sons' as the Lord in respect of Divine Good and of Divine Truth emanating from that Good, dealt with in <a href="9806.htm">9806</a>, <a href="9807.htm">9807</a>, <a href="10017.htm">10017</a>. The reason why things that 
come from one's own power is meant by 'the palms', and why 'being put on the palms' consequently means the acknowledgement that all those things belong to the Lord and come from the Lord, is that 
the palms are part of the hands and power is meant by 'the hands', and 'putting on the palms' means attributing something, thus acknowledging the ownership of it. For what comes next states that the offering 
was to be waved on the palms, by which the life from God that comes as a result is meant; and that life from God is imparted through faith, the first phase of which is acknowledgement. Since power 
is meant by 'the hands' it follows that full power is meant by 'the palms of the hands', because in the palms lies the full grip of the hands. Consequently when palms are attributed to the Lord and 
to Divine Truth emanating from His Divine Good, as it is here, almighty power is meant. From all this it is evident that 'putting on the palms of Aaron and his sons' means acknowledgement of the Lord's 
almighty power, thus that all things belong to Him because all things come from Him in the heavens.  </p>

`Et pones omnia super volis Aharonis, et super volis filiorum ejus': quod significet agnitionem in caelis quod illa sint Domini et a Domino, constat (c)a significatione omnium (d)quae ex ariete, ut 
adipes, renes, (o)et armus dexter, ac quae in corbe, ut panis, placenta, laganum {1}, quod sint Divina Bona ac Divina Vera quae Domini quia ex Domino {2}, de quibus n. 10,070-10,080; et ex significatione 
`volarum' quod sint quae ex propria potentia, ita proprium, de qua sequitur; et ex repraesentatione `Aharonis et filiorum ejus' quod sint Dominus quoad Divinum Bonum (c)ac inde procedens Divinum Verum, 
de qua n. 9806, 9807, 10,017.  Quod `volae' sint quae ex propria potentia, (c)ac inde `poni super volis' sit agnitio quod omnia illa sint Domini et ex Domino {3}, est quia volae sunt manuum, ac 
per manus significatur potentia, ac ponere super illis est addicare, ita agnoscere; nam sequitur quod agitarentur super illis, per quae significatur inde vita (c)a Divino, ac vita (c)a Divino datur per 
fidem, cujus primum est agnitio.  Quia per `manus' significatur potentia, sequitur quod per `volas manuum' significetur plena potentia, quoniam volae plene comprehendunt; inde cum volae praedicantur 
de Domino, ac de Divino Vero procedente ex Divino Bono Ipsius, ut hic significatur omnipotentia {4}; inde patet quod per `ponere super volis Aharonis et filiorum ejus' significetur agnitio omnipotentiae
