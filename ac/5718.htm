<h3 align="center" class="ired">属天的奥秘 第5718节</h3>
<h4 align="center"></h4><p><strong>5718.</strong>有某种类型的灵人想要掌权，成为统治其他所有人的独裁者；为达到这个目的，他们在其他灵人中间挑起各种敌意、仇恨和争斗。我曾看见他们所挑起的争斗，并为之震惊。我打听这些灵人是谁，被告知，他们就是煽动这类激情的那类灵人，因为他们企图按分而治之的原则独揽大权。我也被允许与他们交谈，他们马上说他们统治所有人。但我被引导回答说，他们若试图通过制造这种骚乱来获得统治权，建立自己的统治，就是疯子。这些灵人从我前额正中间上方相当高的位置与我交谈。他们说话很流利，因为活在肉身时，他们就擅长演讲，口才出众。我被指教，他们是与脑中分泌的粗杂粘液有关的灵人，他们通过自己的出现使脑器官丧失活力，造成大脑迟钝，由此导致堵塞，产生大量疾病，以及思维迟钝。<br />我发现他们没有任何良心，并且认为人类的谋略和智慧就在于为了掌权而挑起各种敌意、仇恨和内部斗争。我被引导问他们是否知道自己现身在来世，在这里要活到永远，并且这里的属灵律法完全禁止这类行为。我还告诉他们说，在世时他们在愚蠢人中间可能被敬重并视为智慧人，但在智慧人中间却是疯子。这话让他们很不高兴。我继续说，他们应该知道，天堂在于相爱，或一个人对另一个人的爱；这爱带来天堂的次序，并掌管数百万人如同掌管一人。而他们恰恰相反，因为他们使别人充满对同伴的仇恨、报复和残忍。他们回答说，他们只能是他们本来的样子，不可能是别的什么；对此，我回答说，他们由此可以知道，死后每个人的生活仍与他同在。</p>

There is a certain kind of spirits who, because they wish to have dominion, and to be sole rulers over all others, to this end stir up enmities, hatreds, and fights among others. I have seen the consequent 
fights, and wondered at them. I inquired who they were, and was told that they were that kind of spirits who excite such passions because they are bent on being sole rulers, according to the maxim, 
Divide and rule. It was also granted me to talk with them, and they immediately said that they rule all. But it was given to answer that they were insanity personified if they sought to establish 
their rule by such means. They talked with me from above at a middle height over the forehead. They spoke with fluency, because in the bodily life they had excelled in eloquence. I was instructed that 
they are such as relate to the thick phlegm of the brain, from which organ they take away vitality by their presence, and induce on it torpor, whence come obstructions, giving rise to a number of diseases, 
as well as to dullnesses. [2] It was noticed that they were devoid of all conscience, and that they made human prudence and wisdom to consist in stirring up enmities, hatreds, and intestine fights, 
in order to rule. It was given to ask them whether they know that they are now in the other life, where they are to live to eternity, and that there are spiritual laws there which utterly forbid 
such actions, and that while they were in the world they might among fools be esteemed and believed to be wise, but that among the wise they are insane. This displeased them. I continued, that they 
ought to know that heaven consists in mutual love, or that of one toward another, whence there is order in heaven, whereby so many myriads are ruled as one; but that the contrary is the case with them, 
because they instigate others to breathe against their companions nothing but what savors of hatred, revenge, and cruelty. They replied that they cannot be other than they are; whereupon it was given 
to say that from this they may know that everyone's life remains with him after death. </p>

A certain type of spirits exists who wish to dominate and have sole control over all others; and to achieve this end they stir up all kinds of enmity, hatred, and conflict among those other spirits. 
I have seen the conflicts stirred up by them and have been astonished. I have asked who these spirits were and have been told that they are a particular kind who stir such troubles up because their intention 
is to have sole dominion, acting according to the principle Divide and Rule. I was also allowed to talk to them, when immediately they said they were going to govern everyone. I was led to reply 
that they were madmen if they sought to gain dominion for themselves by creating those kinds of disturbances. These spirits spoke to me from a position above, a fair way up at the centre above my forehead. 
Their words flowed from them like a stream, for during their lifetime they had been clever speakers. I was informed that these spirits are ones that correlate with the crude mucus secreted in 
the brain, from which by their very presence they remove vitality and into which they introduce a sluggishness that leads to obstructions - which are the major causes of many forms of sickness - and 
to slowness of thought also. </p>

<p><b>[2]</b>
 I noticed that these spirits were devoid of any conscience and that they thought that human prudence and wisdom lay in stirring up all kinds of enmity, hatred, and 
internal conflicts for the purpose of gaining dominion over others. I was led to ask them whether they knew that they were now in the next life where they were going to live for ever and where spiritual 
laws existed that completely forbade such actions. I also told them that while in the world they may have been considered and thought to be wise ones among the stupid, but in fact they had been the 
insane among the wise - which they did not like to be told. I went on to say that they ought to know that heaven consists in mutual love, or the love of one person towards another, which love gives rise 
to order in heaven and which love governs so many millions as a single whole. But the contrary of this, I said, existed with them since they filled others with nothing else than feelings of hatred, 
revenge, and cruelty towards their companions. They replied that they could not be anything other than what they were, to which I responded that from this they could know that each person's life remained 
with him. </p>

</p><b>5718.</b>
Est quoddam genus spirituum qui, quia dominari volunt et soli regere omnes alios, ob illum finem excitant inter alios inimicitias, odia et pugnas; vidi {1}inde pugnas, et miratus sum; quaesivi quinam 
essent, dictum quod ejuscemodi genus spirituum sit, qui talia excitant quia soli imperare intendunt, secundum regulam `divide et impera'; dabatur etiam loqui cum illis, qui statim dicebant quod illi 
regerent omnes; respondere datum est quod insaniae essent si imperare suum a talibus quaerant; locuti sunt mecum a superiore ad mediam altitudinem supra frontispicium; loquela eorum erat cum flumine, 
quia eloquio in vita corporis polluerunt.  Instructus sum quod tales sint qui referunt cerebri crassam pituitam, cui per praesentiam vitale adimunt et torporem indunt, unde obstructiones ex quibus principia 
plurium morborum, {2}ut et hebetudines.  [2]Observatum quod essent absque omni conscientia, et quod humanam prudentiam et sapientiam ponerent in excitandis inimicitiis, odiis, intestinis pugnis, 
imperandi causa; {3}interrogare eos datum, num scirent quod nunc in altera vita sint ubi in aeternum victuri, et quod ibi leges spirituales sint quae talia prorsus vetant, et quod dum in mundo fuerunt, 
potuerint aestimari et credi sapientes inter stultos, at {4} quod insani sint inter sapientes; hoc illis displicebat; continuabam quod scire debeant quod caelum consistat in amore mutuo, seu unius 
erga alterum, inde in caelo ordo, et inde tot myriades reguntur ut unus, at quod contrarium sit apud illos, quia infundunt aliis ut non nisi {5} quam {6}quae odii, vindictae et crudelitatis sunt, contra 
socios spirent; respondebant quod aliter quam sunt, non esse possint; ad quae dicere datum quod inde sciant quod vita sua unumquemvis maneat. @1 tales$ @2 et quoque$ @3 dicere ei$ @4 i hic$ @5
