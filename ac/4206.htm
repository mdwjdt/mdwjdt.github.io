<h3 align="center" class="ired">属天的奥秘 第4206节</h3>
<h4 align="center"></h4><p><strong>4206.</strong>“但愿亚伯拉罕的神和拿鹤的神，在你我中间判断”表神性流入这二者，也就是说，既流入那些在教会之内的人所拥有的良善里面，也流入那些在教会之外的人所拥有的良善里面。这从“亚伯拉罕的神”和“拿鹤的神”的含义清楚可知：“亚伯拉罕的神”是指对那些在教会之内的人来说，主的神性；“拿鹤的神”是指对那些在教会之外的人来说，主的神性。由此明显可知，这些话表示神性流入这两种良善。“亚伯拉罕的神”之所以表示对那些在教会之内的人来说，主的神性，是因为亚伯拉罕代表主的神性，因而代表直接出自主的东西（<a href="3245.htm">3245</a>，<a href="3778.htm">3778</a>节）。因此，“亚伯拉罕的子孙”（约翰福音<a href="http://39-27.cn/约8.39.htm">8:39</a>）尤表那些在教会之内的人。“拿鹤的神”之所以表示对那些在教会之外的来说，主的神性，是因为“拿鹤”代表由外邦人所组成的教会，“拿鹤的子孙”代表那些彼此具有兄弟般情谊的人（<a href="2863.htm">2863</a>，<a href="2864.htm">2864</a>，<a href="2868.htm">2868</a>，<a href="3052.htm">3052</a>，<a href="3778.htm">3778</a>节）。也正因如此，作为拿鹤子孙的“拉班”代表边上的良善，就是诸如外邦人从主所接受的那种。<br />之所以代表主的各种事物，不是因为各种事物在主里面，而是因为祂的神性被人接受的方式各不相同。这就像是人里面的生命。这生命流入并作用于身体的各种感觉和运动器官，以及各肢体和脏腑，并且处处呈现出多样性。因为眼睛以一种方式看到，耳朵以另一种方式听到，舌头又以一种方式尝到；以及胳膊和手有一种运动方式；下肢和脚有另一种运动方式；肺以一种方式起作用，心以另一种方式起作用；肝又以一种方式起作用，胃同样以另外一种方式起作用，等等。然而，以各种方式将它们全都激活的，却是一个单一的生命；不是因为生命本身以不同的方式起作用，而是因为它以不同的方式被接受。事实上，正是每种器皿所取的形式决定了它如何起作用。</p>

The God of Abraham and the God of Nahor judge between us. That this signifies the Divine flowing into both, namely, into the good which those have who are within the church, and into the good which those 
have who are outside the church, is evident from the signification of the "God of Abraham," as being the Divine of the Lord regarding those who are within the church; and from the signification of 
the "God of Nahor," as being the Divine of the Lord regarding those who are without the church. From this it is manifest that by these words is signified the Divine flowing into both. The reason why 
the "God of Abraham" denotes the Divine of the Lord regarding those who are within the church, is that Abraham represents the Divine of the Lord, and consequently that which comes directly from the Lord 
(n. 3245, 3878). Hence they who are within the church are specifically meant by the "sons of Abraham" (John 8:39). And the reason why the "God of Nahor" denotes the Divine of the Lord regarding those 
who are out of the church, is that Nahor represents the Church of the Gentiles, and his sons those therein who are in brotherhood (n. 2863, 2864, 3052, 3778, 3868). For this reason also Laban, who 
was Nahor's son, here represents good that is aside, such as the Gentiles have from the Lord. That such various things of the Lord are represented, is not because various things are in the Lord, but 
because His Divine is variously received by men. This is like the life in man, which flows in and acts upon the various sensory and motive organs of the body, and upon the various members and viscera, 
and everywhere presents variety. For the eye sees in one way, the ear hears in another, the tongue perceives in another; so the arms and hands move in one way, and the loins and the feet in a different 
way; the lungs act in one way and the heart in another; the liver in one way and the stomach in another, and so on; but nevertheless it is one life which actuates them all so variously, not because 
the life itself acts in different ways, but because it is differently received; for the form of each organ is that according to which the action is determined. </p>

'May the God of Abraham and the God of Nahor judge between us' means the Divine flowing into both, that is to say, into the good existing with those inside the Church, and into the good with those outside 
it. This is clear from the meaning of 'the God of Abraham' as the Lord's Divine regarding those inside the Church, and from the meaning of 'the God of Nahor' as the Lord's Divine regarding those 
outside the Church; and from this it is evident that these two expressions mean the Divine flowing into both kinds of good. The reasons why 'the God of Abraham' means the Lord's Divine regarding those 
inside the Church is that 'Abraham' represents the Lord's Divine, and consequently that which comes directly from the Lord, <a href="3245.htm">3245</a>, <a href="3778.htm">3778</a>. Those therefore who are inside the Church are meant in particular 
by 'Abraham's children', <a href="http://bible.gospelcom.net/cgi-bin/bible?passage=John%208:39&amp;version=ESV&amp;interface=print&amp;showfn=yes&amp;showxref">John 8:39</a>. And the reason why 'the God of Nahor' means the Lord's Divine regarding those outside the Church is that 'Nahor' represents the Church consisting of gentiles, and 
'his children' those among them who dwell in a brotherly relationship with one another, <a href="2863.htm">2863</a>, <a href="2864.htm">2864</a>, <a href="2868.htm">2868</a>, <a href="3052.htm">3052</a>, <a href="3778.htm">3778</a>. So also at this point, 'Laban' who was Nahor's son represents good that is 'out 
of line', such as gentiles receive from the Lord. </p>

 The reason why such variations involving the Lord are represented is not that those variations exist within the Lord but that His Divine is received 
variously by men. It is like the life present in man. This life flows into and activates the various sensory and motor organs of the body, and the various members and viscera. At every point variety 
presents itself, for the eye sees in one way, the ear hears in another, and the tongue discerns in yet another; also the arm and hand have one kind of movement, the lower limbs and feet another; 
then again the lungs act in one way, the heart in another; also the liver in one way, the stomach in another; and so on. Yet it is one single life that activates them all so variously; not that the life 
itself acts in different ways but because it is received in different ways. Indeed it is the form that each organ takes that determines how it acts. </p>

`Deus Abrahami et Deus Nahoris judicent inter nos': quod significet Divinum in utrumque, nempe in bonum quod illis qui intra Ecclesiam, et in bonum quod illis qui extra Ecclesiam, constat a significatione 
`Dei Abrahami' quod sit Divinum Domini spectans illos qui intra Ecclesiam; et ex significatione `Dei Nahoris' quod sit Divinum Domini spectans illos qui extra Ecclesiam; inde patet quod per 
illa significetur Divinum in utrumque.  Quod `Deus Abrahami' sit Divinum Domini spectans illos qui intra Ecclesiam, est quia `Abraham' repraesentat Divinum Domini, consequenter id quod a Domino 
directe venit, n. 3245, 3778, inde illi qui intra Ecclesiam in specie intelliguntur per `filios Abrahami,' Joh. viii 39; et quod `Deus Nahoris sit Divinum `Domini' spectans illos qui extra Ecclesiam, 
est quia `Nahor' repraesentat Ecclesiam gentium, et `filii ejus' illos ibi qui in fraternitate sunt, n. 2863, 2864, 2868, 3052, 3778; ideo quoque hic `Laban' qui filius Nahoris, repraesentat bonum 
a latere quale es gentibus a Domino.  [2] Quod tam varia Domini repraesententur, non es inde quod varia in Domino sint, sed quod Divinum Ipsius varie ab hominibus recipiatur; se habet hoc sicut 
vita quae apud hominem haec influit et agit in varia corporis organa sensoria et motoria inque varia membra et viscera, ac ubivis varietatem sistit, aliter enim videt oculus, aliter audit auris, aliter 
sentit lingua, tum aliter se movet brachium et manus, et aliter lumbi et pedes, aliter agit pulmo et aliter cor, tum aliter hepar et aliter ventriculus, et sic porro, sed usque est una vita quae 
omnia tam varie agit, non quod ipsa vita aliter agat, sed quia aliter recipitur, est (o)enim forma cujusvis secundum quam determinatur actio {1}.      @1 quae determinat actionem$ </p>
