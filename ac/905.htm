<h4 align="center"></h4><p><strong>905.</strong>“出方舟”表自由。这一点从前面所述，以及语境的连贯性清楚可知。挪亚被洪水围困在方舟里的时间表他受到奴役，即他被恶与假，或也可说，被造成伴随试探的冲突的恶灵所折腾。由此可见，“出方舟”表自由。主的临在必带来自由，一个随另一个而来。主越临在，人就越自由。也就是说，只要对善与真的爱在他里面，他就会在自由中行事，这是主经由天使的流注。而另一方面，地狱经由恶灵的流注则带有力求统治的强迫和冲动。他们的全部意图就是使这个人完全屈从，以致他什么也不是，而他们才是一切。当他们成为一切时，这个人就成了他们中的一员。然而，他几乎算不上他们中的一员，因为在他们眼里，他不过是名副其实的无名小卒。所以，当主从他们的枷锁和统治中将一个人释放出来时，就会产生冲突。不过，一旦得到释放，即得到重生，他就会被主经由天使轻柔引领，根本没有枷锁或统治存在，因为他正被喜乐和愉悦所引领。他在被爱着，也在被尊重着。这就是主在马太福音中所教导的：<br />我的轭是容易的，我的担子是轻省的。（马太福音<a href="http://39-27.cn/太11.30.htm">11:30</a>）<br />与恶灵同在则完全相反。如前所述，与他们同在，一个人会被贬得什么也不是，若有可能，他们会一刻不停地折磨他。我通过大量经历得知这一点，对此，蒙主慈悲，容后再述。</p>

<p><strong>[NCE]905.</strong> The symbolism of going out of the ark as liberty can be seen from earlier statements [<a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_905/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_891" target=_top>891</a>] and from the thread of the story itself, with its pattern of connections.<br />The time that Noah spent in the ark, surrounded by flood water, symbolized being in captivity — that is, being tossed about by evil and falsity or, what amounts to the same thing, by the evil spirits who spark our spiritual battles. From this it follows that leaving the ark symbolizes liberty.<br />The Lord's presence involves liberty; the one is a consequence of the other. The more present the Lord is, the freer we are. In other words, the more we love goodness and truth, the more freely we act. That is the nature of the Lord's influence, coming by way of angels.<br />Hell's influence, on the other hand, coming by way of evil spirits, brings with it the forceful effort to dominate. Those spirits connive at nothing else than to put us so completely under their yoke that we become nothing and they become everything. When they are everything, then we are one of them — and hardly even one of them, but like a nobody in their eyes. So when the Lord delivers us from their control and removes their yoke, a battle begins. And when we have been delivered — reborn — the Lord leads us so gently by means of angels that it is anything but a yoke, anything but domination. Through pleasure and happiness we are led and loved and esteemed. This is what the Lord teaches in Matthew:<br />My yoke is mild and my burden is light. (<a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_905/bible_king-james-version_matthew_11_30" target=_top>Matthew 11:30</a>)<br />The situation is quite the opposite among evil spirits, who consider us worthless, as I said, and would torture us every second if they could. This I know from a great deal of experience that I will relate further on, with the Lord's divine mercy.{*1} <br /><strong>Footnotes:</strong><br />{*1} On the general desire that evil spirits have to inflict torment, see, for example, <a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_905/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_954" target=_top>954</a>, <a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_905/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_959" target=_top>959</a>, <a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_905/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_5863" target=_top>5863-5864</a>.

Go forth from the ark. That this signifies freedom, is evident from what has been said before, and from the connection itself of the context. So long as Noah was in the ark and surrounded with the waters 
of the flood, the signification was that he was in captivity, that is, he was tossed about by evils and falsities, or what is the same thing, by evil spirits, from whom is the combat of temptation. 
Hence it follows that to "go forth from the ark" signifies freedom. The presence of the Lord involves freedom, the one following the other. The more present the Lord, the more free the man; that is, 
the more a man is in the love of good and truth, the more freely he acts. Such is the influx of the Lord through the angels. But on the other hand, the influx of hell through evil spirits is forcible, 
and impetuous, striving to dominate; for such spirits breathe nothing but the utter subjugation of the man, so that he may be nothing, and that they may be everything; and when they are everything 
the man is one of them, and scarcely even that, for in their eyes he is a mere nobody. Therefore when the Lord is liberating the man from their dominion and from their yoke there arises a combat; but 
when the man has been liberated, that is, regenerated, he, through the ministry of angels, is led by the Lord so gently that there is nothing whatever of yoke or of dominion, for he is led by means of 
his delights and his happinesses, and is loved and esteemed. This is what the Lord teaches in Matthew: </p>
<p>     My yoke is easy, and My burden is light (Matt. 11:30),and is the reverse of a man's state 
when under the yoke of evil spirits, who, as just said, account the man as nothing, and, if they were able, would torment him every moment. This it has been given me to know by much experience, concerning 
which, of the Lord's Divine mercy hereafter. </p>

'Going out of the ark' means freedom. This is clear from what has been stated already and from the point reached in the train of thought. Noah's time in the ark surrounded by the flood-waters meant that 
he was in bondage, that is, he was tossed about by evils and falsities, or what amounts to the same, by evil spirits responsible for the conflict that accompanies temptation. From this it follows 
that 'going out of the ark' means freedom. The Lord's presence entails freedom; one follows the other. The more the Lord is present the more free a person becomes, that is, insofar as love of good and 
truth is in him he acts in freedom. Such is the Lord's influx by way of angels. On the other hand, the influx of hell by way of evil spirits brings with it a force and impulsion to dominate. Their whole 
intention is to subjugate a person to the point of making him nothing and themselves everything. When they are everything a person is one of them. Yet he is scarcely one of them but in their eyes 
a veritable nobody. Consequently when the Lord is freeing a person from their yoke and dominion, conflict arises. But once he has been set free, that is, been regenerated, he is led by the Lord through 
angels so gently that no yoke or dominion exists at all, for he is being led by what is joyful and pleasing, he is being loved, and he is being shown respect. This is what the Lord teaches in Matthew, </p>
<blockquote>
My 
yoke is easy, and My burden is light. <a href="http://bible.gospelcom.net/cgi-bin/bible?passage=Matt%2011:30&amp;version=ESV&amp;interface=print&amp;showfn=yes&amp;showxref">Matt 11:30</a>. 
</blockquote>
<p>It is quite the reverse with evil spirits. With them, as has been stated, a person is reckoned as nothing, and if they could they would be 
tormenting him from one moment to the next. This I have been given to know from considerable experience, which will in the Lord's Divine mercy be presented later on. </p>

Quod 'exire de arca' significet libertatem, constat ab illis quae prius dicta sunt et ex ipsa serie contextus rerum: quamdiu Noahus fuit in arca et circumfusus aquis diluvii, significatum quod in captivitate 
fuit, hoc est, agitatus a malis et falsis, seu quod idem est, a malis spiritibus, a quibus pugna tentationis; inde sequitur quod 'exire de arca' significet libertatem: praesentia Domini libertatem 
involvit; unum sequitur alterum; quantum praesentior est Dominus, tantum liberior est homo, hoc est, quantum in amore boni et veri, tantum libere agit; influxus Domini per angelos talis est; at 
contra, influxus inferni per malos spiritus est cum vi et impetu dominandi; nihil apud spirant quam subjugare hominem, in tantum ut nihil sit et illi omne; cum omne sunt, tunc homo est unus eorum, et 
vix unus, sed est sicut nullus in oculis eorum; quare cum Dominus liberat hominem a dominio et jugo eorum, oritur pugna; et cum liberatus est, hoc est, regeneratus, tunc tam leniter ducitur per angelos 
a Domino ut nihil minus sit quam jugum et dominium; per jucunda et felicia ducitur, et amatur, et aestimatur; quod Dominus docet apud Matthaeum, 	Jugum Meum blandum est, et onus Meum leve est, xi 30; </p>
<p>quod 
prorsus contrarium est apud malos spiritus, apud quos, ut dictum, pro nihilo reputatur homo, et si potuissent, cruciarent illum omni momento; quod a multa experientia scire datum, de qua, ex 
Divina Domini Misericordia, in sequentibus. </p>
