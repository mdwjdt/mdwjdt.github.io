Verses 21-23. And the sons of Israel did so: and Joseph gave them carts, according to the mouth of Pharaoh, and gave them provision for the way. And to all of them he gave each changes of garments; and 
to Benjamin he gave three hundred pieces of silver, and five changes of garments. And to his father he sent after this manner: ten asses carrying of the good of Egypt, and ten she-asses carrying grain 
and bread and nourishment for his father for the way. "And the sons of Israel did so," signifies the effect from spiritual truths in the natural; "and Joseph gave them carts, according to the mouth 
of Pharaoh," signifies that from the internal they had doctrinal things as was pleasing; "and gave them provision for the way," signifies support meanwhile from good and truth; "and to all of them he 
gave each changes of garments," signifies truths initiated in good; "and to Benjamin he gave three hundred pieces of silver," signifies that the intermediate had fullness of truth from good; "and five 
changes of garments," signifies much of truth from the natural; "and to his father he sent after this manner," signifies what was given gratuitously to spiritual good; "ten asses carrying of the good 
of Egypt," signifies better memory-knowledges with many things of service; "and ten she-asses carrying grain and bread," signifies the truth of good and the good of truth, also with many things of 
service; "and nourishment for his father for the way," signifies interior truth for spiritual good meanwhile. </p>
