<h3 align="center" class="ired">属天的奥秘 第2480节</h3>
<h4 align="center"></h4><p><strong>2480.</strong>由于人死后会使用以前属于其理性的内部记忆，故那些在世时更擅长语言的人无法召唤出它们中的一个音节；那些更精通科学的人则无法忆起任何知识，有时甚至比其他人更愚蠢。但是，他们凭语言或科学所吸收的东西因为有助于形成他们的理性，所以他们会拿来使用。这些人死后就通过凭语言或科学所获得的理性思考。人若通过语言和科学吸收了虚假，并确认这些虚假，就会通过虚假推理；而人若吸收并确认真理，就会通过真理说话。赋予生命的，正是情感本身：赋予虚假生命的，是对邪恶的情感；而赋予真理生命的，则是对良善的情感。人人都通过情感思考，没有情感，没人思考。</p>

<p align="center"><b>Potts(1905-1910) 2480</b></p><p><b>2480.</b>
Seeing that men after death are in the interior memory (which has belonged to their rational) therefore those who in the world have been preeminently skilled in languages, cannot call forth even one 
syllable of them; and they who have been preeminently versed in the sciences cannot call up anything of their knowledges, and are sometimes more stupid than others. But whatever they have imbibed by means 
of the languages, or of the sciences, this they bring forth into use, because it has formed their rational. The rational they had so procured is that from which they think and speak. He who has imbibed 
falsities by means of the languages and sciences, and has confirmed himself in them, reasons from nothing but falsities; but he who has imbibed and confirmed truths, speaks from the truths. It 
is the affection itself which gives life-the affection of evil which gives life to falsities, and the affection of good which gives life to truths. Everyone thinks from affection, and no one without affection. </p>

<p align="center"><b>Elliott(1983-1999) 2480</b></p><p><b>2480.</b>
Since people after death use the interior memory, which has previously been part of their rational, those people therefore who in the world have been more skilled at languages than others are unable 
to summon up one syllable from them. And people who have been more skilled in branches of learning than others cannot summon up a single fact. Indeed these people are sometimes more stupid than others. 
But whatever they have absorbed through those languages or branches of learning, because it has helped to form their rational, is brought into use by them. It is the rational, acquired by means of languages 
and learning, that these people after death think and speak from. All a person does who has imbibed falsities through languages or branches of learning, and who has confirmed himself in those 
falsities, is reason from falsities, whereas the person who has imbibed truths speaks from truths. Affection is what gives life - the affection for evil giving life to falsities and the affection for 
good giving life to truths. It is from affection that anyone thinks, and nobody thinks without it. </p>

<p align="center"><b>Latin(1748-1756) 2480</b>
</p><b>2480.</b>
Quia homines post mortem in memoria interiore quae eorum rationalis fuit, sunt, inde est quod qui linguas prae aliis calluerunt in mundo, ne quidem unam voculam earum possint depromere; qui in scientiis 
prae aliis non quicquam ex scientificis; et quod hi quandoque stupidiores sint aliis: se quicquid imbuerunt per linguas, et quicquid per scientias, hoc, quia rationale eorum formavit, in usum producunt; 
rationale inde comparatum, est ex quo cogitant et loquuntur; qui falsa per linguas et scientias hausit et in iis confirmavit, non nisi ex falsis ratiocinatur, qui autem vera, ille ex veris loquitur; 
ipsa affectio est quae vitam dat, affectio mali quae vitam falsis, et affectio boni quae vitam veris; ex affectione unusquisque cogitat, et absque affectione nullus. </p>
