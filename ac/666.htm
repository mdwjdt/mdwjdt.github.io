<h3 align="center" class="ired">属天的奥秘 第666节</h3>
<h4 align="center"></h4><p>666．“圣约”无非表重生和构成重生之物。这一点从圣言很多地方清楚可知，其中主自己就被称“圣约”，因为唯独祂重生人，一个重生之人会注目于主，主是爱与信的全部中的全部。以赛亚书清楚表明，主是圣约本身:<br />我耶和华凭公义召你，必搀扶你的手，保守你，使你作众民的约，作外邦人的光。（以赛亚书<a href="http://39-27.cn/赛42.6.htm">42:6</a>）<br />“圣约”表示主，“外邦人的光”是信。同样的内容还可见于以赛亚书49:6，8。玛拉基书：<br />看哪，我要差遣我的天使，我必忽然进入祂的殿；你们所寻求的主必忽然来到他的殿；立约的天使，就是你们所仰慕的，看哪，快要来到。祂来的日子，谁能当得起呢？（玛拉基书<a href="http://39-27.cn/玛3.1.htm">3:1</a>-<a href="http://39-27.cn/玛3.2.htm">2</a>）<br />此处，主被称为“立约的天使”。在出埃及记（<a href="http://39-27.cn/出31.16.htm">31:16</a>）中，安息日被称为永远的约，因为它指主自己。它还指被祂重生的属天之人。<br />②由于主是圣约本身，故显而易见，构成圣约的，是将一个人与主联结起来的一切，也就是说，是爱与信，及属于爱与信之物。事实上，这些是主的，主在它们里面，所以圣约本身存在于这些事物中，就在它们被接受之处。这些事物只存在于已重生者身上，对重生者而言，凡属再造者（Regenerator）或主之物，就构成圣约，或就是圣约。如以赛亚书：<br />我的慈爱必不离开你，我平安的约也不迁移。（以赛亚书<a href="http://39-27.cn/赛54.10.htm">54:10</a>）<br />“慈爱和平安的约”表示主和属于主之物。同一先知书：<br />你们当就近我来，侧耳而听，你的灵魂就得以活。我必与你们立永约，就是应许大卫那可靠的恩典。我已立他作万民的见证，为万民的领袖和立法者（leader and lawgiver）。（以赛亚书<a href="http://39-27.cn/赛55.3.htm">55:3</a>-<a href="http://39-27.cn/赛55.4.htm">4</a>）<br />“大卫”表示主。“永约”通过属于主的那些品质而存在并起作用。“当就近我来，侧耳而听，你的灵魂就得以活”就是指这些品质。<br />③耶利米书：<br />我要使他们彼此同心同道，终生敬畏我，使他们和他们后世的子孙得福。又要与他们立永远的约，不再离开他们，我要向他们施恩，又要把敬畏我的心放在他们心里。（耶利米书<a href="http://39-27.cn/耶32.39.htm">32:39</a>-<a href="http://39-27.cn/耶32.40.htm">40</a>）<br />这段经文论及的是那些要重生之人，以及属于他们的事物，即“同心同道”，就是爱与信，这些事物属于主，因而属于圣约。<br /><br />看哪，耶和华说，日子将到，我要与以色列家和犹大家另立新约。不像我与他们的祖宗所立的约。因为他们背了我的约。那些日子以后，我与以色列家所立的约乃是这样：我要将我的律法放在他们里面，写在他们心上。我要作他们的神，他们要作我的子民。（耶利米书<a href="http://39-27.cn/耶31.31.htm">31:31</a>-<a href="http://39-27.cn/耶31.33.htm">33</a>）<br />这里清楚说明了构成圣约的一切，就是主里面的爱与信，它们存在于要重生之人身上。<br />④在耶利米书33:20，爱被称为白日立的约，信被称为黑夜立的约。以西结书：<br />我耶和华必作他们的神，我的仆人大卫必在他们中间作王。我必与他们立平安的约，使凶猛的野兽从陆地断绝，他们就必安居在旷野，躺卧在林中。（以西结书<a href="http://39-27.cn/结34.24.htm">34:24</a>-<a href="http://39-27.cn/结34.25.htm">25</a>）<br />这明显论及重生。“大卫”表主。<br /><br />大卫必作他们的王，直到永远。我要与他们立平安的约，作为永约。我要在他们中间设立我的圣所，直到永远。（以西结书<a href="http://39-27.cn/结37.25.htm">37:25</a>-<a href="http://39-27.cn/结37.26.htm">26</a>）<br />这同样论及重生。“大卫”和“圣所”表主。<br /><br />我与你立约，你就属于我了。我用水洗你，洗净你身上的血，又用油抹你。（以西结书<a href="http://39-27.cn/结16.8.htm">16:8</a>-<a href="http://39-27.cn/结16.9.htm">9</a>）<br />这清楚表示重生。何西阿书：<br />当那日，我必为我的民与田野的野兽和空中的飞鸟，并地上的爬行物立约。（何西阿书<a href="http://39-27.cn/何2.18.htm">2:18</a>）<br />这表示重生。“田野的野兽”表示意愿之物，“空中的飞鸟”表示觉知之物。诗篇：<br />祂向百姓施行救赎，命定祂的约，直到永远。（诗篇<a href="http://39-27.cn/诗111.9.htm">111:9</a>）<br />这表示重生。之所以被称为“约”，是因为它是被赋予和接受之物。<br />⑤不过，论到未重者，也就是说，将敬拜置于外在事物，并且把自己以及他们随心所欲之物立为神明来敬拜之人，经上说，他们背了约，因为他们背离了主。<br />耶利米书：<br />他们离弃了耶和华他们神的约，事奉敬拜别神。（耶利米书<a href="http://39-27.cn/耶22.9.htm">22:9</a>）<br />摩西五经：<br />若有人去事奉敬拜别神，或拜日头，或拜月亮，或拜天象，违背了他的约，就用石头将他打死（申命记<a href="http://39-27.cn/申17.2.htm">17:2</a>-<a href="http://39-27.cn/申17.3.htm">3</a>，<a href="http://39-27.cn/申17.5.htm">5</a>）<br />“日头”表我欲（对自我之爱），“月亮”表虚假原则，“天象”表虚假本身。由此清楚可知何为“约柜”，它包含证词或圣约，即主自己，还可知何为“约书”，即主自己（出埃及记<a href="http://39-27.cn/出24.4.htm">24:4</a>-<a href="http://39-27.cn/出24.7.htm">7</a>；<a href="http://39-27.cn/出34.27.htm">34:27</a>；申命记<a href="http://39-27.cn/申4.13.htm">4:13</a>，<a href="http://39-27.cn/申4.23.htm">23</a>），以及何为“立约的血”，即主自己（出埃及记<a href="http://39-27.cn/出24.6.htm">24:6</a>，<a href="http://39-27.cn/出24.8.htm">8</a>），唯独祂是再造者（Regenerator）。因此，“圣约”就是重生本身。</p>

<p><strong>[NCE]666.</strong> The fact that a pact means nothing else than rebirth with all it entails can be seen from numerous passages in the Word that call the Lord himself a covenant [or pact]. The term is applied to him because he is the only one to regenerate us and the only one to whom the reborn individual looks. He is also the all-in-all of love and faith.<br />The fact that the Lord is the pact itself can be seen in Isaiah:<br />I, Jehovah, have called you in justice and am holding your hand and guarding you; and I will give you as a pact with the people, as a light for the nations. (<a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_666/bible_king-james-version_isaiah_42_6" target=_top>Isaiah 42:6</a>)<br />The pact stands for the Lord, while the light for the nations means faith. <a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_666/bible_king-james-version_isaiah_49_6" target=_top>Isaiah 49:6</a>, <a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_666/bible_king-james-version_isaiah_49_8" target=_top>8</a> has a similar message. In Malachi:<br />Watch: I am sending my angel, and suddenly to his Temple will come the Lord, whom you are seeking, and the angel of the covenant, whom you desire. Watch: He is coming! Who can endure the day of his coming? (<a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_666/bible_king-james-version_malachi_3_1-2" target=_top>Malachi 3:1-2</a>)<br />In this passage the Lord is called the angel of the covenant. The Sabbath is referred to as an eternal pact in <a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_666/bible_king-james-version_exodus_31_16" target=_top>Exodus 31:16</a> because it symbolizes the Lord. It also symbolizes us when he has regenerated us to the point of being heavenly.<br />[2] As the Lord is the pact itself, we can conclude that everything binding us to the Lord is part of the contract. Love and faith, then, are part of it, as is everything that comes of love and faith. These things are the Lord's, and the Lord is in them. Consequently the covenant itself is in those things wherever they are received. And they are not received except in one who has been reborn. Everything in a person reborn that belongs to the Regenerator — the Lord — is part of the compact or, in other words, is the compact. In Isaiah, for example:<br />My mercy will not withdraw from you, and the compact of my peace will not recede. (<a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_666/bible_king-james-version_isaiah_54_10" target=_top>Isaiah 54:10</a>)<br />The mercy and the compact of peace are the Lord and everything that is his. In the same author:<br />Bend your ear and come to me; listen and let your soul live, and I will strike with you an eternal pact — the reliable mercies [that I showed] to David. Here, now, I have made him a witness to the peoples, a leader and lawgiver for the nations. (<a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_666/bible_king-james-version_isaiah_55_3-4" target=_top>Isaiah 55:3-4</a>)<br />David stands for the Lord. The eternal pact consists in attributes of the Lord's and is fulfilled by means of them. These are the things meant by going to him and listening so that our souls may live.<br />[3] In Jeremiah:<br />I will give them one heart and one way, to fear me every day, with good result to them and to their children after them. And I will strike an eternal pact with them, [pledging] that I will not turn away from doing good to them; and fear of me I will put into their heart. (<a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_666/bible_king-james-version_jeremiah_32_39-40" target=_top>Jeremiah 32:39-40</a>)<br />These words stand for people who are being reborn. They stand also for qualities in the person who has been reborn, those qualities being the one heart and one way. One heart and one way in turn are charity and faith, which are the Lord's and so are part of the compact. In the same author:<br />"Look! The days are coming," says Jehovah, "when I will strike a new pact with the house of Israel and with the house of Judah unlike the pact that I struck with their ancestors, because they nullified my pact. But this is the pact that I will strike with the house of Israel after these days: I will put my law in the midst of them, and upon their heart I will write it, and I will become their God, and they will become my people." (<a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_666/bible_king-james-version_jeremiah_31_31-32" target=_top>Jeremiah 31:31-32</a>, <a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_666/bible_king-james-version_jeremiah_31_33" target=_top>33</a>)<br />This explains openly what a covenant is: love for the Lord and faith in him as adopted by one who is regenerating.<br />[4] The same author calls love a compact with the day and faith a compact with the night (<a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_666/bible_king-james-version_jeremiah_33_20" target=_top>Jeremiah 33:20</a>). In Ezekiel:<br />I, Jehovah, will become their God, and my servant David will be chief in their midst. And I will strike a pact of peace with them and bring an end on the earth to the evil wild animal; and they will live securely in the wilderness and sleep in forests. (<a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_666/bible_king-james-version_ezekiel_34_24-25" target=_top>Ezekiel 34:24-25</a>)<br />This is obviously about regeneration. David stands for the Lord. In the same author:<br />David will be chief over them forever. I will strike a pact of peace with them; it will be an eternal pact with them. I will put my sanctuary in their midst forever. (<a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_666/bible_king-james-version_ezekiel_37_25-26" target=_top>Ezekiel 37:25-26</a>)<br />Again this is about rebirth. David and the sanctuary stand for the Lord. In the same author:<br />I entered into a pact with you, and you were mine; and I washed you with water and cleaned your blood off you and anointed you with oil. (<a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_666/bible_king-james-version_ezekiel_16_8-9" target=_top>Ezekiel 16:8-9</a>, <a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_666/bible_king-james-version_ezekiel_16_11" target=_top>11</a>)<br />Plainly this is about rebirth. In Hosea:<br />I will strike a pact with them on that day — with the wild animal of the field, and with the bird in the heavens and the creeping animal of the earth. (<a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_666/bible_king-james-version_hosea_2_18" target=_top>Hosea 2:18</a>)<br />This stands for regeneration. The wild animal of the field stands for what the will holds, the bird in the heavens for what the intellect holds. In David:<br />He has sent redemption to his people; he has commanded his covenant forever. (<a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_666/bible_king-james-version_psalms_111_9" target=_top>Psalms 111:9</a>)<br />This stands for rebirth. It is called a covenant or contract because it is given and received.<br />[5] There are some, however, who do not regenerate. To put it another way, there are some who consider the outward show of worship to be worship, and who value and revere themselves, their own wishes, and their own thoughts as gods. Because they alienate themselves from the Lord, they are portrayed as nullifying the compact. In Jeremiah, for instance:<br />They abandoned the compact of Jehovah their God and bowed down to other gods and served them. (<a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_666/bible_king-james-version_jeremiah_22_9" target=_top>Jeremiah 22:9</a>)<br />In Moses:<br />Whoever goes against the compact by serving other gods — the sun, the moon, the whole army of the heavens — will be stoned. (<a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_666/bible_king-james-version_deuteronomy_17_2" target=_top>Deuteronomy 17:2</a> and following verses)<br />The sun stands for self-love, the moon for assumptions based on falsities, and the army of the heavens for the falsities themselves.<br />All of this now indicates that the ark of the covenant, containing the testimony (or covenant), was the Lord himself; that the book of the covenant was the Lord himself (<a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_666/bible_king-james-version_exodus_24_4" target=_top>Exodus 24:4</a>, <a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_666/bible_king-james-version_exodus_24_7" target=_top>7</a>; <a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_666/bible_king-james-version_exodus_34_4" target=_top>34:4</a>, <a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_666/bible_king-james-version_exodus_34_5" target=_top>5</a>, <a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_666/bible_king-james-version_exodus_34_6" target=_top>6</a>, <a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_666/bible_king-james-version_exodus_34_7" target=_top>7</a>, <a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_666/bible_king-james-version_exodus_34_27" target=_top>27</a>;{*1} <a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_666/bible_king-james-version_deuteronomy_4_13" target=_top>Deuteronomy 4:13</a>, <a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_666/bible_king-james-version_deuteronomy_4_23" target=_top>23</a>); and that the blood of the covenant was the Lord himself (<a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_666/bible_king-james-version_exodus_24_6" target=_top>Exodus 24:6</a>, <a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_666/bible_king-james-version_exodus_24_8" target=_top>8</a>). The Lord alone is the Regenerator, so the covenant is regeneration itself.<br /><br /><strong>Footnotes:</strong><br />{*1} The first Latin edition cites <a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_666/bible_king-james-version_exodus_24_4-5" target=_top>Exodus 24:4-5</a>, <a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_666/bible_king-james-version_exodus_24_6" target=_top>6</a>, <a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_666/bible_king-james-version_exodus_24_7" target=_top>7</a>, 27, and does not cite <a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_666/bible_king-james-version_exodus_34_1-35" target=_top>Exodus 34</a> at all here, but there is no verse 27 in <a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_666/bible_king-james-version_exodus_24_1-18" target=_top>Exodus 24</a>.

That a "covenant" signifies nothing else than regeneration and the things pertaining to regeneration, is evident from various passages in the Word where the Lord Himself is called the "Covenant" because 
it is He alone who regenerates, and who is looked to by the regenerate man, and is the all in all of love and faith. That the Lord is the Covenant itself is evident in Isaiah: </p>
<p>     I Jehovah have 
called thee in righteousness, and will hold thy hand, and will keep thee, and will give thee for a covenant to the people, for a light of the nations (Isa. 42:6),  where a "covenant" denotes the Lord 
"a light of the nations" is faith. So in chapter 49:6, 8. In Malachi: </p>
<p>     Behold I send Mine angel, and the Lord whom ye seek shall suddenly come to His temple, even the Angel of the covenant whom 
ye desire; behold He cometh; who may abide the day of His coming? (Mal. 3:1, 2),  where the Lord is called the "Angel of the Covenant." The sabbath is called a "perpetual covenant" (Exod. 31:16), because 
it signifies the Lord Himself, and the celestial man regenerated by Him.  [2] Since the Lord is the very covenant itself, it is evident that all that which conjoins man with the Lord is of the 
covenant as love and faith, and whatever is of love and faith-for these are of the Lord, and the Lord is in them; and so the covenant itself is in them, where they are received. These have no existence 
except with a regenerated man, with whom whatever is of the Regenerator or of the Lord is of the covenant, oil is the covenant. As in Isaiah: </p>
<p>     My mercy shall not depart from thee, neither shall 
the covenant of My peace be removed away (Isa. 54:10),  where "mercy" and the "covenant of peace" denote the Lord and what belongs to Him. Again: </p>
<p>     Incline your ear and come unto Me, hear, and your 
soul shall live, and I will make a covenant of eternity with you, the sure mercies of David; behold, I have given Him for a witness to the peoples, a leader and a lawgiver to the nations (Isa. 66:3, 
4). "David" here denotes the Lord; the "covenant of eternity" is in those things and by those things which are of the Lord, and these are meant by going to Him and hearing, that the soul may live. 
[3] In Jeremiah: </p>
<p>     I will give them one heart, and one way, that they may fear Me all the days, for good to them, and to their sons after them. And I will make an everlasting covenant with them, 
that I will not turn away from them, to do them good; and I will put My fear in their heart (Jer. 32:39, 40)." This is said of those who are to be regenerated, and of things that belong to them, namely, 
"one heart and one way" that is, charity and faith, which are of the Lord and so of the covenant. Again: </p>
<p>     Behold the days come, saith Jehovah, that I will make a new covenant with the house of 
Israel and with the house of Judah; not according to the covenant that I made with their fathers, for they rendered My covenant vain: but this is the covenant that I will make with the house of Israel 
after these days; I will put My law in the midst of them, and write it on their heart; and I will be their God, and they shall be My people (Jer. 31:31-33). Here the meaning of a "covenant" is clearly 
explained, that it is the love and faith in the Lord which is with those who are to be regenerated.  [4] And again in Jeremiah, love is called the "covenant of the day" and faith the "covenant of 
the night" (Jer. 33:20). In Ezekiel: </p>
<p>     I, Jehovah, will be their God, and My servant David a prince in the midst of them, and I will make with them a covenant of peace, and I will make the evil 
beast to cease out of the land; and they shall dwell secure in the wilderness, and sleep in the forests (Ezek. 34:24-25). Here regeneration is evidently treated of. "David" denotes the Lord. Again: </p>
<p> 
    David shall be a prince to them to eternity; I will make a covenant of peace with them. It shall be a covenant of eternity with them; I will set My sanctuary in the midst of them to eternity (Ezek. 
37:25-26).Here likewise regeneration is treated of. "David" and the "sanctuary" denote the Lord. And again: </p>
<p>     I entered into a covenant with thee, and thou wast Mine; and I washed thee with waters, 
and washed away thy bloods from upon thee, and I anointed thee with oil (Ezek. 16:8-9), where regeneration is plainly meant. In Hosea: </p>
<p>     In that day will I make a covenant for them with the 
wild beast of the field, and with the fowl of the heavens, and with the creeping thing of the earth (Hos. 2:18), meaning regeneration; the "wild beast of the field" denotes the things that are of the 
will; "the fowl of the heavens" those that are of the understanding. In David: </p>
<p>     He hath sent redemption unto His people; He hath commanded His covenant to eternity (Ps. 111:9), also meaning regeneration. 
It is called a "covenant" because it is given and received.  [5] But of those who are not regenerated, or what is the same, who make worship consist in external things, and esteem and worship 
themselves and what they desire and think as if they were gods, it is said that they render the covenant vain, because they separate themselves from the Lord. And in Jeremiah: </p>
<p>     They have forsaken 
the covenant of Jehovah their God, and have bowed themselves down to other gods, and served them (Jer. 22:9). In Moses: </p>
<p>     He who should transgress the covenant by serving other gods-the sun, 
the moon, the army of the heavens-should be stoned (Deut. 17:2 seq.).The "sun" denotes the love of self; the "moon" principles of falsity; the "army of the heavens" falsities themselves. From all this 
it is now evident what the "ark of the covenant" signified wherein was the "covenant" or "testimony" namely, that it signified the Lord Himself; and that the "book of the covenant" also signified the 
Lord Himself (Exod. 24:4-7; 34:27; Deut. 4:13, 23); and likewise that by the "blood of the covenant" (Exod. 24:6, 8) was signified the Lord Himself, who alone is the Regenerator. Hence the "covenant" 
denotes regeneration itself. </p>

<p align="center"><b>Elliott(1983-1999) 666</b></p><p><b>666.</b>
'A covenant' means nothing other than regeneration and the things that constitute regeneration. This becomes clear from many places in the Word where the Lord Himself is called 'the Covenant', for it 
is He alone who regenerates, to whom a regenerated person looks, and who is the All in all of love and faith. That the Lord is the Covenant itself is clear in Isaiah,  I Jehovah have called You in righteousness, 
taking You by the hand and keeping You, and I will give You for a Covenant of the people, a light of the nations. <a href="http://bible.gospelcom.net/cgi-bin/bible?passage=Isa%2042:6&amp;version=ESV&amp;interface=print&amp;showfn=yes&amp;showxref">Isa 42:6</a>. </p>
<p>Here 'a Covenant' stands for the Lord, and 'the light of the 
nations' is faith. Similarly in <a href="http://bible.gospelcom.net/cgi-bin/bible?passage=Isa%2049:6,%208&amp;version=ESV&amp;interface=print&amp;showfn=yes&amp;showxref">Isa 49:6, 8</a>. In Malachi, </p>
<blockquote>
Behold, I am sending My angel, and suddenly there will come to His temple the Lord whom you are seeking, and the Angel of the Covenant in 
whom you delight. Behold, He is coming. Who will endure the day of His coming? <a href="http://bible.gospelcom.net/cgi-bin/bible?passage=Mal%203:1,%202&amp;version=ESV&amp;interface=print&amp;showfn=yes&amp;showxref">Mal 3:1, 2</a>. 
</blockquote>
<p>Here the Lord is called 'the Angel of the Covenant'. In <a href="http://bible.gospelcom.net/cgi-bin/bible?passage=Exod%2031:16&amp;version=ESV&amp;interface=print&amp;showfn=yes&amp;showxref">Exod 31:16</a> the Sabbath is called an eternal covenant 
because it means the Lord Himself. It also means the celestial man who has been regenerated by Him.  </p>
<p></p>
<p><b>[2]</b>
 The Lord being the Covenant itself, it is clear that what constitutes the covenant is 
everything that joins a person to the Lord, that is to say, love and faith and the things that belong to love and faith. In fact these are the Lord's and the Lord is within them, and so the Covenant 
itself exists within these, where they are received. These things do not exist except with someone who has been regenerated, with whom anything at all that is the Regenerator's, or the Lord's, constitutes 
the covenant, or is the covenant. As in Isaiah, </p>
<blockquote>
My mercy will not depart from you, and the covenant of My peace will not be removed. <a href="http://bible.gospelcom.net/cgi-bin/bible?passage=Isa%2054:10&amp;version=ESV&amp;interface=print&amp;showfn=yes&amp;showxref">Isa 54:10</a>. 
</blockquote>
<p>Here 'mercy and covenant of peace' means the 
Lord and things that are the Lord's. In the same prophet,  </p>
<blockquote>
Incline your ear and come to Me; hear, that your soul may live, and I will make with you an eternal covenant, even the sure mercies of David. 
Lo, I have given Him as a witness to the peoples, a leader and lawgiver to the peoples. <a href="http://bible.gospelcom.net/cgi-bin/bible?passage=Isa%2055:3,%204&amp;version=ESV&amp;interface=print&amp;showfn=yes&amp;showxref">Isa 55:3, 4</a>. 
</blockquote>
<p>Here 'David' stands for the Lord. 'The eternal covenant' exists in and acts through those 
qualities that are the Lord's, which are meant by 'coming to Him' and 'hearing so that your soul may live'. </p>
<p></p>
<p><b>[3]</b>
 In Jeremiah, </p>
<blockquote>
I will give them one heart and one way, to fear Me all their days, for 
their own good and that of their sons after them. I will make with them an everlasting covenant, that I will not turn away from doing good to them, and I will put My fear into their heart. <a href="http://bible.gospelcom.net/cgi-bin/bible?passage=Jer%2031:39,%2040&amp;version=ESV&amp;interface=print&amp;showfn=yes&amp;showxref">Jer 31:39, 40</a>. 
</blockquote>
<p>This stands for those who are to be regenerated, and also for those things with someone regenerate which are 'one heart and one way', namely charity and faith, which belong to the Lord and so 
to the covenant. In the same prophet, </p>
<blockquote>
Behold, the days are coming, said Jehovah, when I will make with the house of Israel and with the house of Judah a new covenant, not like the covenant which 
I made with their fathers, for they rendered My covenant invalid. But this is the covenant which I will make with the house of Israel after those days: I will put My law in the midst of them, and will 
write it on their heart, and I will be their God, and they will be My people. <a href="http://bible.gospelcom.net/cgi-bin/bible?passage=Jer%2031:31-33&amp;version=ESV&amp;interface=print&amp;showfn=yes&amp;showxref">Jer 31:31-33</a>. 
</blockquote>
<p>This is an explicit statement of what constitutes the covenant - love and faith in the Lord, which will 
be present with him who is to be regenerated. </p>
<p></p>
<p><b>[4]</b>
 In the same prophet love is called the covenant far the day, and faith the covenant for the night, Jer. <a href="33.htm">33</a>. <a href="20.htm">20</a>. In Ezekiel, </p>
<blockquote>
I Jehovah will be their 
God, and my servant David will be prince in the midst of them; and I will make with them a covenant of peace, and I will banish the evil wild animal from the land, and they will dwell securely in 
the wilderness and sleep in the woods. <a href="http://bible.gospelcom.net/cgi-bin/bible?passage=Ezek%2034:24,%2025&amp;version=ESV&amp;interface=print&amp;showfn=yes&amp;showxref">Ezek 34:24, 25</a>. 
</blockquote>
<p>This clearly refers to regeneration. 'David' stands for the Lord. In the same prophet, </p>
<blockquote>
David will be their prince for ever. I will make with 
them a covenant of peace, it will be n eternal covenant with them. I will set My sanctuary in their midst for evermore. <a href="http://bible.gospelcom.net/cgi-bin/bible?passage=Ezek%2037:25,%2026&amp;version=ESV&amp;interface=print&amp;showfn=yes&amp;showxref">Ezek 37:25, 26</a>. 
</blockquote>
<p>This similarly refers to regeneration. 'David' and 'the 
sanctuary' stand for the Lord. In the same prophet, </p>
<blockquote>
I entered into a covenant with you, and you were Mine. And I washed you with water and washed away your blood from upon you, and anointed you with 
oil. <a href="http://bible.gospelcom.net/cgi-bin/bible?passage=Ezek%2016:8,%209,%2011&amp;version=ESV&amp;interface=print&amp;showfn=yes&amp;showxref">Ezek 16:8, 9, 11</a>. 
</blockquote>
<p>This clearly stands for regeneration. In Hosea,  </p>
<blockquote>
I will make for them a covenant on that day, with the wild animals of the field, and with the birds of the air,<A name="fntext1"></a><A href="#fn1"><sup>a</sup></a> and with 
the creeping things of the earth. <a href="http://bible.gospelcom.net/cgi-bin/bible?passage=Hosea%202:18&amp;version=ESV&amp;interface=print&amp;showfn=yes&amp;showxref">Hosea 2:18</a>.  
</blockquote>
<p>This stands for regeneration. 'Wild animals of the field' stands for things of the will, 'birds of the air'<A name="fntext1"></a><A href="#fn1"><sup>a</sup></a> for those of the understanding. In David, 
 </p>
<blockquote>
He sent redemption to His people, He commanded His covenant for ever. <a href="http://bible.gospelcom.net/cgi-bin/bible?passage=Ps%20111:9&amp;version=ESV&amp;interface=print&amp;showfn=yes&amp;showxref">Ps 111:9</a>. 
</blockquote>
<p>This stands for regeneration. This is called 'a covenant' because it is something given and received. </p>
<p></p>
<p><b>[5]</b>
People however who have not been regenerated - or what amounts to the same, who focus worship on things that are external and who set up and worship as gods both themselves and everything they desire 
and think- are referred to, because they separate themselves from the Lord, as rendering the covenant invalid', as in Jeremiah, </p>
<blockquote>
They forsook the covenant of Jehovah their God, and bowed down to other 
gods and served them <a href="http://bible.gospelcom.net/cgi-bin/bible?passage=Jer%2022:9&amp;version=ESV&amp;interface=print&amp;showfn=yes&amp;showxref">Jer 22:9</a>. 
</blockquote>
<p>In Moses, </p>
<blockquote>
He who transgressed the covenant by serving other gods, the sun, the moon, and the host of heaven, was to be stoned. <a href="http://bible.gospelcom.net/cgi-bin/bible?passage=Deut%2017:2&amp;version=ESV&amp;interface=print&amp;showfn=yes&amp;showxref">Deut 17:2</a> 
</blockquote>
and following verses. 
 </p>
<p>'The sun' stands for self-love, 'the moon' for false assumptions, 'the host of heaven' for falsities themselves. From this it is now clear what 'the Ark of the covenant' is, containing the testimony 
or covenant, namely the Lord Himself; what 'the Book of the covenant' is, namely the Lord Himself, <a href="http://bible.gospelcom.net/cgi-bin/bible?passage=Exod%2024:4-7;%2034:27&amp;version=ESV&amp;interface=print&amp;showfn=yes&amp;showxref">Exod 24:4-7; 34:27</a>; <a href="http://bible.gospelcom.net/cgi-bin/bible?passage=Deut%204:13,%2023&amp;version=ESV&amp;interface=print&amp;showfn=yes&amp;showxref">Deut 4:13, 23</a>; what 'the Blood of the covenant' is, namely the Lord Himself, 
<a href="http://bible.gospelcom.net/cgi-bin/bible?passage=Exod%2024:6,%208&amp;version=ESV&amp;interface=print&amp;showfn=yes&amp;showxref">Exod 24:6, 8</a>; who alone is the Regenerator. Hence 'a covenant' is regeneration itself.

Quod 'foedus' nihil aliud significet quam regenerationem et quae regenerationis sunt, constare potest ex Verbo passim ubi Ipse Dominus appellatur 'Foedus,' quia Ipse unicus est Qui regenerat, et Qui 
ab homine regenerato spectatur, et est Omne in omnibus amoris et fidei: quod Dominus sit ipsum Foedus constat apud Esaiam, 	Ego Jehovah vocari Te in justitia, et apprehendens manum Tuam, et custodiens 
Te, et dabo Te in Foedus populi, in lucem gentium, xlii 6; </p>
<p>ubi 'foedus' pro Domino; 'lux gentium' est fides; similiter, cap. xlix 6, 8: apud Malachiam, 	Ecce Ego mittens angelum Meum,... et subito 
veniet ad templum Suum Dominus, Quem vos quaerentes, et Angelus 	foederis, quem vos desideratis; ecce venit,... quis sustinet diem Adventus Ipsius, iii 1, 2; </p>
<p>ubi Dominus appellatur 'Angelus foederis.' 
Sabbatum appellatur 'foedus aeternum,' Exod. xxxi 16, quia significat Ipsum Dominum; et hominem ab Ipso regeneratum caelestem.  [2] Quia Dominus est ipsum Foedus, constat quod foederis sit omne quod 
conjungit hominem Domino, ita amor et fides, et quae sunt amoris et fidei; illa enim sunt Domini et in illis Dominus, ita ipsum foedus in illis ubi recipiuntur; haec non dantur nisi quam apud regeneratum, 
apud quem quicquid est Regeneratoris seu Domini, hoc est foederis seu foedus; ut apud Esaiam, 	Misericordia Mea a tecum non recedet, et foedus pacis Meae non dimovebitur, liv 10; </p>
<p>ubi 'misericordia 
et foedus pacis' est Dominus et quae sunt Domini: apud eundem, 	Inclinate aurem vestram et ite ad Me, audite et vivat {1} ad vestra, et pangam vobis foedus aeternitatis, misericordias Davidis 
firmas; en testem populis dedi Ipsum, ducem et legislatorem populis, {2} lv 3, 4; </p>
<p>ubi 'David' pro Domino; 'foedus aeternitatis' in illis, et per illa, quae sunt Domini, quae intelliguntur per 'ire ad 
Ipsum,' et 'audire ut vivat anima': [3] apud Jeremiam, 	Dabo illis cor unum et viam unam, ad timendum Me omnibus diebus in bonum illis et filiis illorum post illos; feriamque illis foedus saeculi, quod 
non avertar a post eos, 	ad benefaciendum Me illis, et timorem Meum dabo in cor 	illorum, xxxii 39, 40; </p>
<p>pro illis qui regenerandi, tum pro iis quae sunt apud regeneratum, quae sunt 'cor unum, et 
via una,' hoc est, charitas et fides, quae sunt Domini, ita foederis: apud eundem, 	Ecce dies venientes, dictum Jehovae, et pangam cum domo Israelis, et cum domo Jehudae foedus pacis; non sicut foedus 
quod pepigi cum patribus eorum,... quia ii irritum reddiderunt foedus Meum:... sed hoc foedus, quod pangam cum 	domo Israelis post dies hos,... dabo legem Meam in medio eorum, et super cor eorum scribam 
illam, eroque iis in Deum, et ii erunt Mihi in populum, xxxi 31-33; </p>
<p>manifeste hic explicatur quid 'foedus,' quod sit amor et fides in Dominum, quae apud regenerandum: [4] apud eundem, appellatur 
amor 'foedus diei,' et fides 'foedus noctis,' xxxiii 20: apud Ezechielem, 	Ego Jehovah ero illis in Deum, et servus Meus David princeps in medio illorum,... et pangam illis foedus pacis, et cessare 
faciam feram malam e terra, et habitabunt in deserto confidenter, et dormient in silvis, xxxiv 24, 25; </p>

apud eundem, 	Inii foedus tecum,... et fuisti Mihi; et lavi te aquis, et ablui sanguines tuos desuper te, et unxi te oleo, xvi 8, 	9, 11; </p>
<p>ubi manifeste pro regeneratione: apud Hosheam, 	Pangam 
illis foedus in die illo, cum fera agri et cum avis caelorum et reptili terrae, ii 18; </p>
<p>pro regeneratione; 'fera agri' pro illis quae sunt voluntatis, 'avis caelorum' quae sunt intellectus: apud Davidem, 	Redemptionem 
misit populo Suo, praecepit in aeternum foedus Suum, Ps. cxi 9; </p>
<p>pro regeneratione: 'foedus' dicitur quia datur et recipitur.  [5] Qui vero non regenerati sunt, seu quod idem est, 
qui in externis ponunt cultum, et semet et quae cupiunt et cogitant, sicut pro diis aestimant et colunt, et quia separant se a Domino, praedicatur de iis quod 'irritum reddant foedus'; ut apud Jeremiam, 	Deseruerunt
