<h3 align="center" class="ired">属天的奥秘 第1020节</h3>
<h4 align="center"></h4><p><strong>1020.</strong>这句经文表示这些事物，从以下事实明显可知：从创世记第一章到论及希伯的第十一章，被连贯成历史的一切事物所表示的，完全不同于字面上所显现的；还有就是，这些历史叙事是照着上古之人的习惯而纯粹虚构的历史。当证实某个事物的真理时，他们就会说“耶和华说”。然而，此处经上用“神”说，是因为所论述的主题是属灵教会。当有真实事物出现，或应验时，他们就会说这样的话。</p>

<p><strong>[NCE]1020.</strong> This symbolism can be seen by considering the nature of the text from <a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_1020/bible_king-james-version_genesis_1_1-31" target=_top>Genesis 1</a> through the mention of Eber in <a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_1020/bible_king-james-version_genesis_11_1-32" target=_top>Genesis 11</a>.{*1} Everything assembled into the story there has a different meaning than appears in the letter, and the narrative details are pure fiction. This was the custom of the earliest people.{*2} When they were testifying to the truth of a matter, they would say "Jehovah said" (although here it is expressed as "God said," since the text is talking about a spiritual religion).{*3} They said the same thing when anything was to come true or had come true.<br /><br /><strong>Footnotes:</strong><br />{*1} Swedenborg asserts here that early Genesis contains fiction and later Genesis contains fact, and assigns the point of transition to <a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_1020/bible_king-james-version_genesis_11_1-32" target=_top>Genesis 11</a>, and specifically to its mention of Eber. Eber is, however, actually first mentioned in <a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_1020/bible_king-james-version_genesis_10_21" target=_top>Genesis 10:21</a>, and the location of that first appearance may suggest that Swedenborg considered him to be a fictional character. But many other passages support the understanding that Swedenborg saw him instead as an actual person; see, for example, <a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_1020/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_1238" target=_top>1238</a>, <a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_1020/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_1241" target=_top>1241</a>, <a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_1020/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_1283" target=_top>1283</a>. Furthermore, Eber is frequently thought to be an eponym for the Hebrews; Swedenborg himself explicitly makes this identification in <a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_1020/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_1343#subsection-2-6" target=_top>1343:6</a>. See also <a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_1020/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_1221" target=_top>1221</a>, where Eber is said to refer to "the second ancient church." [JSR, RS]<br />{*2} The "custom of the earliest people" was to make up a narrative framework for the inner meaning they intended to communicate. Swedenborg holds that it is this type of fictional narrative that appears in <a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_1020/bible_king-james-version_genesis_1_1-31" target=_top>Genesis 1</a>-<a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_1020/bible_king-james-version_genesis_11_1-32" target=_top>11</a>, though after that point the biblical narrative does have a literal basis. For more on the mode of writing used by the earliest people, see <a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_1020/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_66" target=_top>66:1</a>, <a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_1020/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_1410" target=_top>1410</a>. [RS, SS]<br />{*3} Compare the passages in which the Old Testament prophets precede their utterances with the phrase "this is what Jehovah has said," such as <a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_1020/bible_king-james-version_amos_1_6" target=_top>Amos 1:6</a>, <a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_1020/bible_king-james-version_amos_1_9" target=_top>9</a>, <a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_1020/bible_king-james-version_amos_1_11" target=_top>11</a>, <a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_1020/bible_king-james-version_amos_1_13" target=_top>13</a>.

That these things are signified is evident from the fact that all things put historically, from the first chapter of Genesis to Eber in the eleventh chapter, signify things quite different from those 
which appear in the letter, and the historical series is only made-up history, after the manner of the most ancient people, who when they would attest the truth of a thing, declared that "Jehovah said" 
it. Here however it is said that "God" said, because the subject treated of is the spiritual church. They used the same form of speaking when anything true was coming to pass, or had done so. </p>

<p align="center"><b>Elliott(1983-1999) 1020</b></p><p><b>1020.</b>
That these things are meant becomes clear from the fact that everything put together as history from Genesis <a href="1.htm">1</a> down to Eber in Chapter <a href="11.htm">11</a> means something different from what appears in the letter, and 
from the consideration that the historical narratives there are purely made-up history customary among the most ancient people. When attesting the truth of some matter they would say that 'Jehovah said 
it'. Here however 'God' is used because the subject is the spiritual Church. And they did the same when anything true was being, or had been, put into effect. </p>

Quod haec significentur, constare potest ex eo quod omnia quae a primo capite Geneseos usque ad Eberum cap. xi historice concinnata sunt, significent alia quam qualia in littera exstant, et quod historica 
ibi non sint nisi facta historica secundum morem antiquissimorum; qui cum veritatem rei testatam facerent, dicebant quod 'Jehovah dixit,' hic autem quod 'Deus' quia de Ecclesia spirituali agitur: 
similiter cum aliquid verum fieret, aut verum factum sit. </p>
