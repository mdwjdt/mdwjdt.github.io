<h3 align="center" class="ired">属天的奥秘 第3000节</h3>
<h4 align="center"></h4><p><strong>3000.</strong>因此，宇宙万物，无论总体还是细节，皆代表主的国度，以至于整个宇宙及其星座、各种大气和三个王国，无非是代表主在天上荣耀的一种舞台。在动物界，不仅人类，而且每种生物，哪怕最小、最低等的，如毛虫，都具有代表性。这些小生物在地上爬行，以植物为食；等交配时节到来后，它们就变成蛹，并很快装上翅膀，然后展翅从地面飞到空中，也就是它们的天堂，在那里享受自己的快乐和自由，一起嬉戏，从花蕊中汲取营养，产卵，从而产下后代。这时，它们便处于天堂状态，也在自己的美丽中。谁都能看出，这些事便代表了主的国度。</p>

Hence it is that all things in the universe both in general and in particular represent the Lord's kingdom; insomuch that the universe with all its constellations, atmospheres, and three kingdoms, is 
nothing else than a kind of theater representative of the Lord's glory which is in the heavens. In the animal kingdom not only man, but also each particular animal, even the least and lowest, is representative; 
as for instance the little creatures that creep on the ground and feed on plants; these, when their time for wedding is at hand, become chrysalises, and presently, being supplied with wings 
they soar from the ground into the atmosphere, their heaven, and there enjoy their delight and their freedom, sporting together and feeding on the spoils of the flowers, laying their eggs and thus providing 
for a posterity; and being then in their state of heaven, they are also in their beauty. Everyone can see that these things are representative of the Lord's kingdom. </p>

Consequently each and all things in the universe represent the Lord's kingdom, so much so that the universe with all its constellations, its various atmospheres, and its three kingdoms is nothing else 
than a kind of stage on which the Lord's glory as it exists in heaven is represented. In the animal kingdom not only man but also each living creature, even the smallest and meanest of them, is representative, 
such as the caterpillars. These crawl on the ground and feed on plants, and when the time to mate is at hand they become chrysalises. Soon after that they are furnished with wings, with which 
they are raised up from the ground into the air, which is their heaven. There they enjoy freedom of movement as they sport together, obtain nourishment from the best parts of the flowers, lay their 
eggs, and so produce a future generation. At this time they attain that state which is their particular heaven and also their beauty. That these things are representative of the Lord's kingdom anyone may see. </p>

</p><b>3000.</b>
Inde est quod omnia et singula quae in universo sunt, repraesentent regnum Domini, usque adeo ut universum cum suis {1}sideribus, suis atmosphaeris, suis tribus regnis, nihil aliud sit quam quoddam 
theatrum repraesentativum gloriae Domini quae in caelis: in regno animali non solum homo, sed etiam singula animalia, quoad minima et vilissima illorum, repraesentant; sicut vermiculi qui humi repunt, 
et vescuntur oleribus, cum tempus illorum nuptiarum instat, quod tunc fiant chrysallides, et mox instruantur alis, et sic attollantur ab humo in atmosphaeram, suum caelum, et ibi fruantur suo gaudio, 
et suo libero, ludentes inter se, et ex florum opimis victum habentes, ponentes ova, et sic consulentes posteritati; et qui tunc in sui caeli statu sunt, etiam in pulchritudine sua sunt; quod haec repraesentativa 
sint regni Domini, quisque videre potest. @1 A had caelis but d and i sideribus$  </p>
