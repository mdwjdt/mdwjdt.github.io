<h3 align="center" class="ired">属天的奥秘 第1795节</h3>
<h4 align="center"></h4><p><strong>1795.</strong>“我家业”表外在教会。这从“家业”的含义清楚可知，就内义而言，“家业”涉及教会。当内在教会本身是家，并且一家之主是主时，外在教会就被称为“家业”。外在教会就是这种情形，因为一切家业都属于外在教会，如仪式，以及属于敬拜的处所和教会本身，即属于耶和华或主之家的很多事物。<br />没有内在事物的教会外在事物一文不值。外在事物通过内在事物存在，并且其性质和内在事物的一样。它们的情形如同人的：人的外在或肉体本身毫无价值，除非有内在事物赋予它灵魂和生命。因此，内在如何，外在就如何；或性情和心智如何，经由外在或肉体所出一切的价值就如何。构成人的是属心脏之物，而非属口唇和举止之物，教会的内在事物正是如此。不过，教会的外在仍象一个人的外在，因为它们都充当管家或监管人；或也可说，当“家”表内层事物时，外在或肉体人同样可被称为这个家的管家或监管人。由此明显可知“无子”的含义，即它表示没有教会的内在，只有教会的外在，这正是主当时所抱怨的。</p>

<p><strong>[NCE]1795.</strong> And my "child," the steward of my household, symbolizes outward religion, as can be seen from what the steward of a household symbolizes on an inner level, or in regard to religion. Outward religion is called the steward of a household when real, internal religion is the household itself and when the head of the house is the Lord. This is exactly the role of the outward church. All management belongs to the external aspect of religion. This includes administration of the rites and of other activities associated with the church building and with religion itself — that is, with the house of Jehovah, or the Lord's house.<br />[2] The externals of religion without the internals are nothing. The internals make the externals something and give them their quality. The situation resembles that of a human being. Our facade, or our person, is not much by itself, unless there is something inside to animate it and bring it to life. So what is inside determines how good the outside is. In other words, the nature of our thoughts and instincts determines the value of everything expressed through our outward, physical part. What the heart holds makes us who we are, not words or gestures. The same with the inward aspects of religion. Still, the externals of religion are like our own externals; they carry out all management and administration. To say the same thing another way, our outward, physical self can likewise be called the steward or manager of a household when the household is that of our inward parts.<br />This shows what childlessness is; it is a time when there is no inward aspect to religion, only an outward aspect, as was true in the period the Lord was deploring. </p>

And the steward of my house. That this signifies an external church, is evident from the signification of the "steward of a house," in the internal sense, that is, in respect to the church. The external 
church is called "the steward of a house," when the internal church itself is the house, and the father of the family is the Lord. The external church is circumstanced no otherwise, for all stewardship 
belongs to the external of the church; as the administration of rituals, and of many things that pertain to the place of worship and to the church itself, that is, to the House of Jehovah or of 
the Lord.  [2] The externals of the church without the internals are things of naught; they have their being from the internals, and are such as the internals are. The case herein is the same as it is 
with man: his external or corporeal is in itself a thing of no account unless there is an internal which gives it soul and life. Such therefore as is the internal, such is the external; or such as is 
the mind [animus et mens], such is the worth of all things which come forth by means of the external or corporeal. The things which are of the heart make the man; not those which are of the mouth and 
the gestures; and such is the case with the internals of the church. But still the externals of the church are like the externals of a man, in that they take charge of and administer; or what is the 
same, the external or corporeal man may in like manner be called the steward or administrator of the house, when the house means the interiors. From this it is evident what "childless" means, namely, 
the state in which there is no internal of the church, but only an external; as was the case at the time of which the Lord complained. </p>

'And the steward of my house' means the external Church. This is clear from the meaning in the internal sense of 'steward of the house', that is, in reference to the Church. The external Church is called 
'the steward of the house' when the internal Church itself is 'the house' and the head of the household is the Lord. The position which the external Church occupies is nothing other than this, for 
all stewardship belongs to the external side of the Church, such as the performance of rituals and many other duties connected with the Temple and the Church itself, that is, Jehovah's or the Lord's 
House. </p>

<p><b>[2]</b>
 The external things of the Church when they are without the internal things are of no value. It is to those internal things that they owe their existence, and in character they are the 
same as those internal things. The situation with them is as it is with man: with him what is external or bodily is in itself something valueless unless that which is internal exists to give it soul and 
life. As is the character therefore of that which is internal, so is the character of that which is external; or, as is the character of the disposition and mind (animus et mens), so is the worth of 
all the things which come forth through that which is external or bodily. The things of the heart make man, not those of the lips and gestures. It is the same with the internal things of the Church. 
Nevertheless the external things of the Church are as the external things with man, in that they serve as stewards or overseers; or what amounts to the same, the external or bodily man may be called 
the steward or overseer of the house when 'the house' is that which belongs to interior things. From this it is evident what 'childless' means, namely a time when no internal dimension of the Church exists, 
only an external, as it was at the time regarding which the Lord made complaint. </p>

</p><b>1795.</b>
'Et filius procurator domus meae': quod significet Ecclesiam externam, constat a significatione 'procuratoris domus' in sensu interno, hoc est, respective ad Ecclesiam; Ecclesia externa dicitur 'procurator 
domus,' cum ipsa Ecclesia interna 'domus,' et 'paterfamilias' Dominus; Ecclesia externa non aliter se habet; omnis enim procuratio pertinet ad externum Ecclesiae, sicut administratio ritualium, 
et plurium quae sunt Templi et ipsius Ecclesiae, hoc est, Domus Jehovae seu Domini.  [2] Externa Ecclesiae absque internis nihili sunt, sed ab internis habent quod sint, et talia sunt qualia interna; 
se habet hoc sicut homo; externum ejus seu corporeum est in se quoddam nullum nisi internum sit quod animet et vivificet; quale itaque est internum, tale est externum; seu qualis est animus et mens, 
talis aestimatio omnium quae existunt per externum seu corporeum; quae cordis sunt, faciunt hominem, non quae oris et gestuum; ita quoque interna Ecclesiae; sed usque externa Ecclesiae se habent sicut 
externa hominis, quod procurent et administrent, seu quod idem est, externus seu corporeus homo similiter dici potest 'procurator seu administrator domus,' cum 'domus' est interiorum: ex his patet quid 
'improles,' nempe cum non internum Ecclesiae sed modo externum, sicut fuit tempore illo, de quo Dominus conquestus. </p>
