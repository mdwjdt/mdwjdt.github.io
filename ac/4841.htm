<h3 align="center" class="ired">属天的奥秘 第4841节</h3>
<h4 align="center"></h4><p><strong>4841.</strong>创世记38:11.犹大就对他儿媳他玛说，你在你父亲家里守寡，等我儿子示拉长大；因为他说，恐怕示拉也死，像他的哥哥一样。他玛就去住在她父亲家里。<br />“犹大就说”表总体上雅各的后代，尤其来源于犹大的。“对他儿媳他玛”表代表属灵和属天之物的教会，它因真理而被称为“儿媳”。“你在你父亲家里守寡”表该教会疏远犹太教会。“等我儿子示拉长大”表等到那个时候。“因为他说”表思维。“恐怕示拉也死，像他的哥哥一样”表唯恐它灭亡。“他玛就去住在她父亲家里”表该教会疏远犹太教会。</p>

Verse 11. And Judah said to Tamar his daughter-in-law, Remain a widow in thy father's house, till Shelah my son be grown up; for he said, Lest he also die, like his brethren. And Tamar went and abode 
in her father's house. "And Judah said," signifies in general the posterity of Jacob, specifically that from Judah; "to Tamar his daughter-in-law" signifies a church representative of spiritual and celestial 
things, which is called "daughter-in-law" from truth; "Remain a widow in thy father's house," signifies alienation from itself; "till Shelah my son be grown up," signifies until the time; "for 
he said," signifies thought; "Lest he also die, like his brethren," signifies fear lest it should perish; "and Tamar went and abode in her father's house," signifies alienation from itself. </p>

Verse 11 And Judah said to Tamar his daughter-in-law, Remain a widow in your father's house, until Shelah my son is grown up; for he said, In case he also dies, like his brothers. And Tamar went and 
remained in her father's house. </p>
<p>'Judah said' means in general the descendants of Jacob, specifically those descended through Judah. 'To Tamar his daughter-in-law' means a Church representative of spiritual 
and celestial things, which is called 'a daughter-in-law' from truth. 'Remain a widow in your father's house' means the alienation of this Church from the Jewish Church. 'Until Shelah my son 
is grown up' means until the time. 'For he said' means thought. 'In case he also dies, like his brothers' means fear lest it should perish. 'And she remained in her father's house' means the alienation 
of this Church from the Jewish Church. </p>

Vers. 11.  Et dixit Jehudah Tamari nurui suae, Mane vidua domo patris tui, usque adolescit Shelah filius meus, quia dixit, Forte moriatur etiam hic, sicut fratres ejus; et ivit Tamar, et mansi domo 
patris sui.  `Dixit Jehudah' significat in genere posteritatem Jacobi, in specie illam ex Jehudah: `Tamari nurui suae' significat Ecclesiam repraesentativam spiritualium et caelestium, quae `nurus' 
dicitur ex vero: `Mane vidua domo patris tui' significat abalienationem a se: `usque adolescit Shelah filius meus' significat dum tempus: `qui dixit' significat cogitationem: </p>
<p>`Forte moriatur etiam 
hic sicut fratre ejus' significat timorem ne periret: `et mansit domo patris sui' significat abalienationem a se. </p>
