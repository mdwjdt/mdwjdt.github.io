<h3 align="center" class="ired">属天的奥秘 第389节</h3>
<h4 align="center"></h4><p><strong>389.</strong>“凡遇见我的必杀我”表一切恶与假将摧毁他，这一点从前文可推知。实情就是这样：当人丧失仁时，就自行背离主，因为唯独仁，即爱邻和仁慈将人与主联结起来。哪里没有仁，哪里就有分离，哪里有分离，哪里就只剩人自己或他的自我；然后，凡他所想的，尽是虚假，凡他所愿的，尽是邪恶。这些就是杀戮人的东西，或使他丧失余留的生命。</p>

<p><strong>[NCE]389.</strong> In consequence, anyone who finds me will kill me means that all evil and falsity would destroy him.<br />The situation is this: When we deprive ourselves of charity, we cut ourselves off from the Lord. Charity — love for others and mercy — is the only thing that binds us to the Lord. Without charity, there is disconnection. When there is disconnection, we are left to ourselves, or to our own devices. Under those circumstances, every thought we think is false and every purpose we intend is evil. These are the things that kill a person, or cause a person to be lifeless. </p>
<p align="center"><b>Potts(1905-1910) 389</b></p><p><b>389.</b>
That "everyone finding him would slay him" signifies that every evil and falsity would destroy him, follows from what has been said. For the case is this. When a man deprives himself of charity, he separates 
himself from the Lord, since it is solely charity, that is, love toward the neighbor, and mercy, that conjoin man with the Lord. Where there is no charity, there is disjunction, and where there 
is disjunction, man is left to himself or to his Own; and then whatever he thinks is false, and whatever he wills is evil. These are the things that slay man, or cause him to have nothing of life remaining. </p>

<p align="center"><b>Elliott(1983-1999) 389</b></p><p><b>389.</b>
'Everyone finding him would kill him' means that all evil and falsity would destroy him. This follows from what is said above. The position in fact is this: When a person divests himself of charity, 
he in that case separates himself from the Lord. It is charity alone, or love towards the neighbour and compassion, which joins man to the Lord. Without charity the two are disjoined, and when they are 
disjoined man is left to himself, that is, to the proprium. In that case whatever he thinks is false, and whatever he wills is evil. These are the things that kill man, that is, lead to his having no 
life at all.  </p>

<p align="center"><b>Latin(1748-1756) 389</b>
</p><b>389.</b>
Quod 'omnis inveniens occideret' sit quod omne malam et falsum perderet eam, sequitur inde; se enim ita res habet: cum homo privat se charitate, tunc separat se a Domino; sola charitas, seu amor erga 
proximam et misericordia, est quae conjungit hominem Domino; absque charitate est disjunctio; cum disjunctio, tunc sibi seu proprio relictus est; quicquid tunc cogitat, est falsam, et quicquid tunc 
vult, est malum; haec sunt quae occidunt hominem, seu faciunt ut nihil vitae habeat. </p>
