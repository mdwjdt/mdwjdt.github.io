<h4 align="center"></h4><p><strong>6850.</strong>出埃及记3:7，8.耶和华说，我已经看见我的百姓在埃及的困苦，我已经听见他们从督工面前所发的哀声；我原知道他们的痛苦；我下来是要救他们脱离埃及人的手，叫他们从那地上来，到美好宽阔之地，流奶与蜜之地，就是到迦南人、赫人、亚摩利人、比利洗人、希未人、耶布斯人的地方。<br />“耶和华说，我已经看见我的百姓的困苦”表对被虚假侵扰后的那些属于属灵教会之人的怜悯。“我已经听见他们从督工面前所发的哀声”表这种怜悯的帮助反对那些想迫使他们服侍的人。“我原知道他们的痛苦”表对他们陷入虚假何等之深的预见。“我下来是要救他们脱离埃及人的手”表祂要俯身把他们从虚假记忆知识的权能中释放出来，这些知识试图毁灭教会的真理。“叫他们从那地上来”表他们要被提升。“到美好宽阔之地”表到仁之良善和信之真理所在的天堂。“流奶与蜜”表它们是喜悦和快乐的源头。“就是到迦南人、赫人的地方”表由虚假产生的邪恶所占据的区域。“亚摩利人、比利洗人”表由邪恶和这些邪恶产生的虚假所占据。“希未人、耶布斯人”表由含有某种良善与真理在里面的偶像崇拜所占据。</p>

Verses 7, 8. And Jehovah said, Seeing I have seen the affliction of My people, which is in Egypt, and I have heard their cry from before their taskmasters; for I have known their sorrows; and I am come 
down to liberate them out of the hand of the Egyptians, and to make them come up out of that land unto a land good and broad, unto a land flowing with milk and honey, unto the place of the Canaanite, 
and the Hittite, and the Amorite, and the Perizzite, and the Hivite, and the Jebusite. "And Jehovah said, Seeing I have seen the affliction of My people" signifies mercy toward those who are of the 
spiritual church after infestations by falsities; "and I have heard their cry from before their taskmasters" signifies the aid of mercy against those who desired to compel them to serve; "for I have 
known their sorrows" signifies foresight in regard to how much they would be immersed in falsities; "and I am come down to deliver them out of the hand of the Egyptians" signifies that He would let Himself 
down to them to set them free from the power of false memory-knowledges, which endeavor to destroy the truths of the church; "and to make them come up out of that land" signifies that they should 
be elevated; "unto a land good and broad" signifies to heaven, where are the good of charity and the truth of faith; "flowing with milk and honey" signifies the pleasantness and delight thence; "unto 
the place of the Canaanite, and the Hittite" signifies the region occupied by evils from falsities; "and the Amorite, and the Perizzite" signifies by evils and the derivative falsities; "and the Hivite, 
and the Jebusite" signifies by idolatry in which there is somewhat of good and truth. </p>

Verses 7, 8 And Jehovah said, I have indeed seen the affliction of My people who are n Egypt, and have heard their cry from before their taskmasters; for I know their sorrows. And I have come down to 
deliver them from the hand of the Egyptians, and to cause them to come up out o that land to a land good and broad, to a land flowing with milk and honey, to the place of the Canaanite and the Hittite, 
and the Amorite and the Perizzite, and the Hivite and the Jebusite. </p>
<p>'And Jehovah said, I have indeed seen the affliction of My people' means the mercy shown towards those who belonged to the spiritual 
Church after molestations by falsities. And have heard their cry from before their taskmasters' means the help of that mercy in opposition to those who wished to compel them to serve. For I know 
their sorrows' means foresight of how deeply they would be plunged into falsities. And I have come down to deliver them from the hand of the Egyptians' means that He would stoop down to them to release 
them from the power of false factual knowledge, which tries to destroy the truths of the Church. 'And to cause them to come up out of that land' means that they would be raised up. 'To a land good 
and broad' means to heaven where the good of charity and the truth of faith are. 'Flowing with milk and honey' means which are a source of pleasure and delight. 'To the place of the Canaanite and the 
Hittite' means the region occupied by evils that arise from falsities. 'And the Amorite and Perizzite' means occupied by evils and the falsities that arise from them. 'And the Hivite and the Jebusite' 
means occupied by what is idolatrous but has some kind of goodness and truth in it. </p>

Vers. 7, 8.  Et dixit Jehovah, Videndo vidi afflictionem populi Mei, qui in Aegypto, et clamorem illorum audivi a coram exactoribus illius, quia novi dolores illius.  Et descendi ad liberandum illum 
e manu Aegyptiorum, et ad ascendere faciendum illum e terra illa ad terram bonam et latam, ad terram fluentem lacte et melle, ad locum Cananaei et Chittaei, et Emorraei et Perisaei, et Chivaei et Jebusaei. 
 `Et dixit Jehovah, Videndo vidi afflictionem populi Mei' significat misericordiam erga illos qui ab Ecclesia spirituali post infestationes a falsis: `et clamorem {1}illorum audivi a coram exactoribus 
illius' significat misericordiae opem contra illos qui ad serviendum adigere voluerunt: `quia novi dolores illius' significat {2}praevidentiam, quantum falsis immersi fuerint: `et descendi ad 
liberandum illum e manu Aegyptiorum' significat quod Se demitteret ad illos ad eximendum e potentia falsorum scientificorum, quae vera Ecclesiae destruere conantur: `et ad ascendere faciendum illum e 
terra illa' significat quod elevarentur: `ad terram bonam et latam' significat ad caelum ubi bonum charitatis et verum fidei: `fluentem lacte et melle' significat et inde amoenum et jucundum: `ad locum 
Cananaei et Chittaei' significat regionem occupatam a malis ex falsis: `et Emorraei et Perisaei,' significat a malis et inde falsis: `et Chivaei et Jebusaei' significat ab idololatrico in quo aliquid 
boni et veri. 	@1 eorum I$ 	@2 Providentiam I$ </p>
