<h3 align="center" class="ired">属天的奥秘 第1691节</h3>
<h4 align="center"></h4><p><strong>1691.</strong>“山”表我欲和物欲。这从下文所论述的“山”的含义清楚可知。一切恶和假皆由我欲和物欲产生，它们没有别的源头。事实上，我欲和物欲是属天和属灵之爱的反面。因是反面，故它们是一直努力摧毁神国的属天和属灵之物的各种爱。由我欲和物欲生出各种仇恨，由仇恨生出各种报复和残忍，由这二者又生出各种欺骗，总之，生出一切地狱。<br />在圣言中，“山”表我欲和物欲，这从以下经文清楚看出来，以赛亚书：<br />眼目高傲的必降为卑，性情狂傲的都必屈膝。必有万军耶和华降罚的一个日子，要临到骄傲狂妄的，一切大山和被举高的小冈，一切高塔。（以赛亚书<a href="http://39-27.cn/赛2.11.htm">2:11</a>，<a href="http://39-27.cn/赛2.12.htm">12</a>，<a href="http://39-27.cn/赛2.14.htm">14</a>，<a href="http://39-27.cn/赛2.15.htm">15</a>）<br />“高山”明显表我欲，“被举高的小冈”表物欲。<br />同一先知书：<br />一切山谷都要填满，大小山冈都要削平。（以赛亚书<a href="http://39-27.cn/赛40.4.htm">40:4</a>）<br />这也明显表我欲和物欲。<br />我要使大山小冈变为荒场，使其上的花草都枯干。（以赛亚书<a href="http://39-27.cn/赛42.15.htm">42:15</a>）<br />此处“大山”同样表我欲，“小冈”表物欲。以西结书：<br />众山必崩裂，悬崖必塌陷，所有的墙垣都必倒在地上。（以西结书<a href="http://39-27.cn/结38.20.htm">38:20</a>）<br />耶利米书：<br />行毁灭的山哪，就是毁灭全地的山哪！我要和你作对，我要伸手攻击你，使你从山岩上滚下来，使你成为烧毁了的山。（耶利米书<a href="http://39-27.cn/耶51.25.htm">51:25</a>）<br />这论及巴别和迦勒底，如前所述，它们分别表示我欲和物欲。摩西之歌：<br />因为在我怒中有火烧起，直烧到极深的阴间，把地和地的出产，尽都焚烧，山的根基也烧着了。（申命记<a href="http://39-27.cn/申32.22.htm">32:22</a>）<br />“山的根基”表地狱，这一点说得很明白。它们被称为“山的根基”，是因为我欲和物欲在他们里面居于主导地位，并来自他们。<br />约拿书：<br />诸水环绕我，几乎淹没我的灵魂；深渊围住我，海草缠绕我的头。我下到山根，地的门将我永远关住。耶和华我的神啊，你却将我的性命从坑中救出来。（约拿书<a href="http://39-27.cn/拿2.5.htm">2:5</a>，<a href="http://39-27.cn/拿2.6.htm">6</a>）<br />约拿在大鱼腹中时以预言的方式描述了主针对地狱的试探。其它经文，尤其诗篇同样如此。凡经历试探之人皆在地狱中。在地狱中根本不是地方的问题，而是状态的问题。<br />由于“大山”和“高塔”表我欲和物欲，故清楚可知主被引到高山和殿顶意味着什么，也就是说，祂被引入试探的争战中，而且是反对我欲和物欲，即地狱的最为严厉的争战。大山也具有正面意义，这是很常见的。它们的正面意义是指属天和属灵之爱，如前所述（<a href="795.htm">795</a>，<a href="796.htm">796</a>节）。</p>

<p><strong>[NCE]1691.</strong> The fact that a mountain is self-love and materialism can be seen from the symbolism of a mountain as discussed just below.<br />All evil and falsity spring from self-love and materialism. They have no other origin. Love for oneself and love of worldly advantages are the opposite of heavenly and spiritual love, and since they are the opposite, they are personified by people who work ceaselessly to destroy anything heavenly or spiritual in God's kingdom. Self-love and materialism give rise to all hatred, hatred to all vengefulness and cruelty, and vengefulness and cruelty to all deceit — in short, to all the hells.<br />[2] The symbolism in the Word of mountains as self-love and materialism is illustrated by the following passages. In Isaiah:<br />The eyes of human pride will lower, and the loftiness of human beings will sink. The day of Jehovah Sabaoth will come over all the proud and lofty, over all the lofty mountains, and over all the tall hills, and over every high tower. (<a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_1691/bible_king-james-version_isaiah_2_11-12" target=_top>Isaiah 2:11-12</a>, <a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_1691/bible_king-james-version_isaiah_2_14-15" target=_top>14-15</a>)<br />Clearly the lofty mountains stand for self-love and the tall hills for materialism.<br />[3] In the same author:<br />Every valley will be raised up, and every mountain and hill will be lowered. (<a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_1691/bible_king-james-version_isaiah_40_4" target=_top>Isaiah 40:4</a>)<br />Here too they plainly stand for self-love and materialism. In the same author:<br />I will devastate mountains and hills, and all their grass I will wither. (<a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_1691/bible_king-james-version_isaiah_42_15" target=_top>Isaiah 42:15</a>)<br />Again the mountains stand for self-love and the hills for the love of worldly things. In Ezekiel:<br />The mountains will be torn down, and the stairs will fall, and every wall will fall to the earth. (<a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_1691/bible_king-james-version_ezekiel_38_20" target=_top>Ezekiel 38:20</a>)<br />[4] In Jeremiah:<br />Here now, I am against you, destroying mountain, destroying the entire earth; and I will stretch my hand out against you and roll you down from the rocks{*1} and make you a mountain aflame. (<a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_1691/bible_king-james-version_jeremiah_51_25" target=_top>Jeremiah 51:25</a>)<br />This describes Babylon and Chaldea, which symbolize self-love and love of worldly advantages, as shown before [<a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_1691/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_1326" target=_top>1326</a>, <a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_1691/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_1368" target=_top>1368</a>]. In the Song of Moses:{*2} A fire has kindled in my anger, and it will burn all the way to the lowest hell, and it will consume the earth and its produce and torch the foundations of the mountains. (<a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_1691/bible_king-james-version_deuteronomy_32_22" target=_top>Deuteronomy 32:22</a>)<br />The foundations of the mountains stand for the hells, as it explicitly says. The hells are called the foundations of the mountains because self-love and materialism reign supreme there and come from there.<br />[5] In Jonah:<br />Water surrounded me right to my soul; the abyss circled me; seaweed was bound onto my head. To the excavations of the mountains I went down. The poles of the earth lay above me forever; but you brought my life up out of the pit, Jehovah my God. (<a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_1691/bible_king-james-version_jonah_2_5-6" target=_top>Jonah 2:5-6</a>)<br />These prophetic words depict the Lord's struggles against the hells as Jonah's ordeal in the belly of the huge fish. The same struggles are described in other Scripture passages as well, especially in David.{*3} Anyone in spiritual crisis is in hell. Being in hell has nothing to do with location and everything to do with state of mind.<br />[6] From the symbolism of mountains and towers as self-love and materialism we can deduce what it meant when the Devil took the Lord onto a tall mountain and onto the pinnacle of the Temple. It meant that he was being led into the very worst of his spiritual battles against love for himself and for the material world, or in other words, against the hells.<br />In the opposite sense (the usual one), mountains symbolize heavenly love and spiritual love, as demonstrated earlier in <a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_1691/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_795" target=_top>795</a>, <a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_1691/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_796" target=_top>796</a>.<br /><br /><strong>Footnotes:</strong><br />{*1} The probable reason that Swedenborg sets the word "rocks" (Latin petrae) in italics here is that the underlying Hebrew word (סְלָעִים [sǝlā‘îm]) means crags or cliffs — "rocks" as high as the mountains and hills that Swedenborg is explaining. [LHC]<br />{*2} Scripture actually gives two songs of Moses, <a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_1691/bible_king-james-version_exodus_15_1-18" target=_top>Exodus 15:1-18</a> and <a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_1691/bible_king-james-version_deuteronomy_32_1-43" target=_top>Deuteronomy 32:1-43</a>. At different times Swedenborg refers to each of these as "the Song of Moses" (Latin Canticum Mosis, so capitalized): compare <a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_1691/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_842#subsection-2-5" target=_top>842:5</a> and 6125:5 (which refer to the former) with this passage, <a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_1691/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_4311#subsection-2-5" target=_top>4311:5</a>, <a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_1691/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_6075#subsection-2-2" target=_top>6075:2</a>, and <a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_1691/swedenborg_true-christian-religion-chadwick_845#subsection-2-2" target=_top>True Christianity 845:2</a> (which refer to the latter). For a New Testament reference to "the Song of Moses," see <a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_1691/bible_king-james-version_revelation_15_3" target=_top>Revelation 15:3</a>. [JSR]<br />{*3} For passages Swedenborg reads as foreshadowing the Lord's struggles with the hells while he was on earth, see the quotations in <a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_1691/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_4728#subsection-2-5" target=_top>4728:5</a>.

That "the mountain" means the love of self and the love of the world, may be seen from the signification of a "mountain," concerning which presently. All evil and falsity come forth from the love of 
self and the love of the world; they have no other origin; for the love of self and the love of the world are the opposites of celestial love and spiritual love; and because they are the opposites, they 
are what are continually endeavoring to destroy the celestial and spiritual things of the kingdom of God. From the love of self and of the world come forth all hatreds; from hatreds, all revenges and 
cruelties; and from these, all deceits; in short, all the hells.  [2] That in the Word by "mountains" there is signified the love of self and the love of the world, may be seen from the following 
passages. In Isaiah: </p>
<p>     The proud eyes of man shall be humbled and the loftiness of men shall be brought low. The day of Jehovah Zebaoth is upon all that is proud and lofty, upon all the high mountains, 
and upon all the hills that are lifted up, and upon every lofty tower (Isa. 2:11-12, 14-15); </p>
<p>the "high mountains" plainly denote the love of self; and the "hills that are lifted up," the love of 
the world.  [3] Again: </p>
<p>     Every valley shall be exalted, and every mountain and hill shall be made low (Isa. 40:4); </p>
<p>here also "mountain and hill" manifestly denote the love of self and the love 
of the world. Again: </p>
<p>     I will lay waste mountains and hills, and dry up all their herbage (Isa. 42:15); </p>
<p>where also "mountains" denote the love of self, and "hills" the love of the world. In Ezekiel: </p>
<p> 
    The mountains shall be thrown down, and the steep places shall fall, and every wall shall fall to the earth (Ezek. 38:20). [4] In Jeremiah: </p>
<p>     Behold I am against thee, O destroying mountain, 
which destroyest all the earth; and I will stretch out mine hand against thee, and roll thee down from the rocks, and will make thee a mountain of burning (Jer. 51:25); </p>
<p>where Babel and Chaldea 
are spoken of, by which is signified the love of self and of the world, as before shown. In the Song of Moses: </p>
<p>     A fire is kindled in Mine anger, and shall burn unto the lowest hell, and shall devour 
the earth and her increase, and set on fire the foundations of the mountains (Deut. 32:22); </p>
<p>"the foundations of the mountains" mean the hells, as is plainly said; these are called the foundations 
of the mountains, because the love of self and the love of the world reign in them, and are from them.  [5] In Jonah: </p>
<p>     The waters compassed me about, even to the soul; the deep was round about 
me; the seaweed was wrapped about my head; I went down to the cuttings-off of the mountains; the bars of the earth were upon me forever; yet hast Thou brought up my lives from the pit, O Jehovah my God 
(Jonah 2:5-6); </p>
<p>the Lord's temptations against the hells are thus prophetically described by Jonah, when he was in the belly of the great fish. So likewise in other passages of the Word, especially 
in David. He who is in temptations is in the hells; place has nothing to do with being in the hells, but state.  [6] As "mountains" and "towers" signify the love of self and of the world, it may be 
seen what is signified by the Lord's being taken by the devil "upon a high mountain," and "upon a pinnacle of the temple," namely, that He was led into temptation combats, the most extreme of all, against 
the loves of self and of the world, that is, against the hells. "Mountains" also, in the opposite sense, signify celestial and spiritual love, as before shown (n. 795, 796). </p>

<p align="center"><b>Elliott(1983-1999) 1691</b></p><p><b>1691.</b>
That 'a mountain' means self-love and love of the world becomes clear from the meaning of 'a mountain', dealt with immediately below. All evil and falsity arise from self-love and love of the world; 
they have no other origin. Indeed self-love and love of the world are the reverse of celestial and spiritual love. And being the reverse they are loves which endeavour all the time to destroy the celestial 
and spiritual things of God's kingdom. From self-love and love of the world all kinds of hatred arise, and from hatred all kinds of revenge and cruelty, and from both the former and the latter all 
kinds of deception, in short, all the hells. </p>
<p></p>
<p><b>[2]</b>
 That 'mountains' in the Word means self-love and love of the world becomes clear from the following places: In Isaiah, </p>
<blockquote>
The eyes of man's (homo) 
loftiness will be humbled, and the height of men (homo) brought low; the day of Jehovah Zebaoth will be against everyone that is lofty and high, against all high mountains, and against all hills that 
are lifted up, and against every lofty tower. <a href="http://bible.gospelcom.net/cgi-bin/bible?passage=Isa%202:11,%2012,%2014,%2015&amp;version=ESV&amp;interface=print&amp;showfn=yes&amp;showxref">Isa 2:11, 12, 14, 15</a>. 
</blockquote>
<p>'High mountains' plainly stands for self-love, and 'hills that are lifted up' for love of the world. </p>
<p></p>
<p><b>[3]</b>
 In the same prophet, </p>
<blockquote>
Every 
valley will be lifted up, and every mountain and hill made low. <a href="http://bible.gospelcom.net/cgi-bin/bible?passage=Isa%2040:4&amp;version=ESV&amp;interface=print&amp;showfn=yes&amp;showxref">Isa 40:4</a>. 
</blockquote>
<p>This too plainly stands for self-love and love of the world. In the same prophet, </p>
<blockquote>
I will lay waste mountains 
and hills, and dry up every plant on them. <a href="http://bible.gospelcom.net/cgi-bin/bible?passage=Isa%2042:15&amp;version=ESV&amp;interface=print&amp;showfn=yes&amp;showxref">Isa 42:15</a>. 
</blockquote>
<p>Here similarly 'mountains' stands for self-love, and 'hills' for love of the world. In Ezekiel, </p>
<blockquote>
The mountains will be overturned, and the 
terraced ridges will fall, and every wall will fall to the ground. <a href="http://bible.gospelcom.net/cgi-bin/bible?passage=Ezek%2038:20&amp;version=ESV&amp;interface=print&amp;showfn=yes&amp;showxref">Ezek 38:20</a>. 
</blockquote>
<p></p>
<p><b>[4]</b>
 In Jeremiah, </p>
<blockquote>
Behold, I am against you, O destroying mountain, destroying the whole earth, and I will stretch 
out My hand against you and roll you down from the rocks and make you into a mountain of burning. <a href="http://bible.gospelcom.net/cgi-bin/bible?passage=Jer%2051:25&amp;version=ESV&amp;interface=print&amp;showfn=yes&amp;showxref">Jer 51:25</a>. 
</blockquote>
<p>This refers to Babel and Chaldea, which, as shown already, mean self-love and love of the 
world. In the Song of Moses, </p>
<blockquote>
A fire has flared up in My anger, and will burn right down to the lowest hell, and will devour the land and its increase, and will set on fire the foundations of the 
mountains. <a href="http://bible.gospelcom.net/cgi-bin/bible?passage=Deut%2032:22&amp;version=ESV&amp;interface=print&amp;showfn=yes&amp;showxref">Deut 32:22</a>. 
</blockquote>
<p>'The foundations of the mountains' stands for the hells, as is explicitly stated. They are called 'the foundations of the mountains' because self-love and love of the world 
reign there and have their origin in them. </p>
<p></p>
<p><b>[5]</b>
 In Jonah, </p>
<blockquote>
The waters surrounded me, even to my soul, the deep closed around me, seaweed was wrapped about my head. I went down to the bottoms of the 
mountains; the bars of the land were upon me for ever. Yet You brought up my life<A name="fntext1"></a><A href="#fn1"><sup>a</sup></a> from the pit, O Jehovah my God. <a href="http://bible.gospelcom.net/cgi-bin/bible?passage=Jonah%202:5,%206&amp;version=ESV&amp;interface=print&amp;showfn=yes&amp;showxref">Jonah 2:5, 6</a>. 
</blockquote>
<p>The Lord's temptations against the hells are described in this prophetic 
manner by Jonah when in the stomach of the great fish, as also in other parts of the Word, especially in David. A person undergoing temptation is within the hells. Being in the hells is not at 
all a question of place but of state. </p>
<p></p>
<p><b>[6]</b>
 Since 'mountains' and 'towers' mean self-love and love of the world, it may therefore become clear what is meant by the reference to the Lord being led by 
the devil on to a high mountain and on to the pinnacle of the temple, namely that He was led into conflicts that constitute temptations - the most extreme conflicts of all - against self-love and love 
of the world, that is, against the hells. Mountains are also used, as is usual, in the contrary sense; in that sense they mean celestial and spiritual love, as shown already in <a href="795.htm">795</a>, <a href="796.htm">796</a>.

Quod 'mons' sit amor sui et amor mundi, constare potest a significatione 'montis,' de qua mox.  Omne malum et falsum existit ab amore sui et amore mundi; non alia origo illorum est; amor enim sui et 
mundi sunt opposita amori caelesti et spirituali; et quia opposita, sunt ii qui caelestia et spiritualia regni Dei destruere continue conantur; ex amore sui et mundi existunt omnia odia, ex odiis omnes 
vindictae et crudelitates, ex illis et his omnes doli, in summa omnia inferna.  [2] Quod per 'montes' in Verbo significetur amor sui et mundi, constare potest ab his locis; apud Esaiam, 	Oculi superbiae 
hominis humiliabitur, et deprimetur altitudo 	hominum;... dies Jehovae Zebaoth super omne superbum et altum,... super omnes montes altos, et super omnes colles elatos, et super omnem turrim excelsam, 
ii 11, 	12, 14, 15; </p>
<p>manifeste 'montes alti' pro amore sui, et 'colles elati' pro amore mundi: [3] apud eundem, 	Omnis vallis extolletur, et omnis mons et collis humiliabuntur, x 14; </p>
<p>etiam manifeste 
pro amore sui et mundi: apud eundem, 	Vastabo montes et colles, et omnem herbam eorum arefaciam, xlii 15; </p>
<p>similiter 'montes' pro amore sui, et 'colles' pro amore mundi: apud Ezechielem, 	Diruentur 
montes, et cadent gradus, et omnis murus in terram cadet, xxxviii 20: </p>
<p>[4] apud Jeremiam, 	Ecce Ego contra te, mons perdens, perdens universam terram, et extendam manum Meam contra te, et devolvam 
te de petris, et dabo te in montem combustionis, li 25; </p>
<p>ubi de Babele et Chaldaea, per quas quod amor sui et mundi significetur, prius ostensum: in cantico Mosis, 	Ignis accensus est in ira Mea, 
et ardebit usque ad infernum infimum, et comedet terram et proventum ejus, et inflammabit fundamenta montium, Deut. xxxii 22; </p>
<p>'fundamenta montium' pro infernis, ut manifeste dicitur; fundamenta montium 
vocantur quia amor sui et amor mundi ibi regnant, et inde sunt: [5] apud Jonam, 	Circumdederunt me aquae usque ad animam, abyssus circumcinxit me, alga alligata capiti meo; ad excisiones montium 
descendi; terrae vectes super me in aeternum, at ascendere fecisti e fovea vitas meas, Jehovah Deus mi, ii 	6, 7; </p>
<p>tentationes Domini contra inferna per 'Jonam cum erat in ventre piscis magni' prophetice 
ita describuntur; ut quoque alibi in Verbo, cumprimis apud Davidem; qui in tentationibus est, in infernis est; in infernis esse, nihil facit locus, sed status.  [6] Quia 'montes' et 'turres' significant 
amorem sui et mundi, inde constare potest quid significatur per id quod Dominus ductus a diabolo super montem altum et super pinnam templi, nempe in omnium extremas tentationum pugnas contra 
amores sui et mundi, hoc est, contra inferna.  Montes etiam in opposito sensu, ut solitum, significant amorem caelestem et spiritualem, ut ostensum prius n. 795, 796. </p>
