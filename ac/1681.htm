And the king of Sodom, and the king of Gomorrah, and the king of Admah, and the king of Zeboiim, and the king of Bela (which is Zoar) went out and marshaled the battle with them in the valley of Siddim — with Chedorlaomer, king of Elam; and Tidal, king of Goiim; and Amraphel, king of Shinar; and Arioch, king of Ellasar; four kings against five.<br />The king of Sodom, and the king of Gomorrah, and the king of Admah, and the king of Zeboiim, and the king of Bela (which is Zoar), went out symbolizes the evil and falsity that were in general control, as it did before. And marshaled the battle with them means that they attacked. In the valley of Siddim here as before symbolizes something unclean. With Chedorlaomer, king of Elam; and Tidal, king of Goiim; and Amraphel, king of Shinar; and Arioch, king of Ellasar, symbolizes truth and goodness in the [Lord's] outer self. Chedorlaomer, king of Elam, symbolizes truth; Tidal, king of Goiim, symbolizes goodness; and the others symbolize everything that results. Four kings against five symbolizes the unity of the truth and goodness and the disunity of the evil and falsity. </p>

Verses 8, 9. And there went out the king of Sodom, and the king of Gomorrah, and the king of Admah, and the king of Zeboiim, and the king of Bela, this is Zoar; and they set the battle in array with 
them in the valley of Siddim; with Chedorlaomer king of Elam, and Tidal king of Goiim, and Amraphel king of Shinar, and Arioch king of Ellasar; four kings with five. "There went out the king of Sodom, 
and the king of Gomorrah, and the king of Admah, and the king of Zeboiim, and the king of Bela, this is Zoar," signifies, as before, the evils and falsities that reign generally; "and they set the battle 
in array with them," signifies that they began the attack; "in the valley of Siddim," signifies here as before, uncleanness; "with Chedorlaomer king of Elam, and Tidal king of Goiim, and Amraphel 
king of Shinar, and Arioch king of Ellasar," signifies the truths and goods in the external man; "Chedorlaomer king of Elam," signifies the truth; "Tidal king of Goiim," the good; and the others the 
things derived from these; "four kings with five," signifies the union of the last named, and the disunion of the others. </p>

Verses 8, 9 And the king of Sodom went out, and the king of Gomorrah, and the king of Admah, and the king of Zeboiim, and the king of Bela, that is, Zoar, and they drew up for battle with them in the 
valley of Siddim - with Chedorlaomer king of Elam, and Tidal king of Goiim, and Amraphel king of Shinar, and Arioch king of Ellasar - four kings with five. </p>
<p>'The king of Sodom went out, and the king 
of Gomorrah, and the king of Admah, and the king of Zeboiim, and the king of Bela, that is, Zoar' means, as previously, evils and falsities which reign generally. 'And they drew up for battle with them' 
means that they made an attack. 'In the valley of Siddim' here, as previously, means uncleanness 'With Chedorlaomer king of Elam, and Tidal king of Goiim, and Amraphel king of Shinar, and Arioch 
king of Ellasar' means truths and goods in the External Man, 'Chedorlaomer king of Elam' meaning truths, 'Tidal king of Goiim' goods, and the other two those that are derivatives from these. 'Four kings 
with five' means the union existing with the latter four and the lack of union with the other five. </p>

Vers. 8, 9.  Et exivit rex Sodomae, et rex Admae, et rex Admae, et rex Zeboiim, et rex Belae, haec Zoar, et ordinaverunt cum iis praelium in valle Siddim; cum Kedorlaomero rege Elam, et Tidale rege 
Goiim, et Amraphele rege Shinar, et Ariocho rege Ellasar; quatuor rege cum quinque. 'Exivit rex Sodomae, et rex Amorae, et rex Admae et rex Zeboiim, et rex Belae, haec Zoar' significant, ut prius, mala 
e falsa communiter regnantia: 'et ordinaverunt cum iis praelium significant quod aggressi: 'in valle Siddim.' significat, hic ut prius, immundum: 'cum Kedorlaomero rege Elam, et Tidale rege Goiim, et 
Amraphele rege Shinar, et Ariocho rege Ellasar' significant vera et bona in Externo Nomine; 'Kedorlaomer rex Elam' vera; 'Tidal rex Goiim' bona; 'ceteri' quae inde: 'quatuor reges cum quinque' significat 
horum unionem, et illorum disunionem. </p>
