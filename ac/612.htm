<h3 align="center" class="ired">属天的奥秘 第612节</h3>
<h4 align="center"></h4><p><strong>612.</strong>“挪亚是个义人，在他自己那代人中是个完全人”意思是他能被赋予仁爱。这从“义”和“完全”两词的含义清楚可知，“义”与仁之善有关，“完全”与仁之真有关；也可从以下事实看出来，即该教会的本质是仁爱，对此，蒙主怜悯，容后再述。“义”与仁之善有关，“完全”与仁之真有关，这一点从圣言清楚看出，如以赛亚书：<br />他们天天寻求我，乐意明白我的道，好像行义的国民，不离弃他们神的典章，向我求问公义的判语，喜悦亲近神。（以赛亚书<a href="http://39-27.cn/赛58.2.htm">58:2</a>）<br />这里的“判语”表示与真理有关的事物，“公义”表示与良善有关的事物。“行审判与正义”可以说已经成了善与真的固定用语，如以赛亚书56:1；耶利米书22:3，13，15；23:5；33:15；以西结书33:14，16，19。主说：<br />那时，义人在他们父的国里，要发出光来，像太阳一样。（马太福音<a href="http://39-27.cn/太13.43.htm">13:43</a>）<br />这是指被赋予仁爱的人。还有，论到时代的末了，主说：<br />天使要出来，从义人中把恶人分别出来。（马太福音<a href="http://39-27.cn/太13.49.htm">13:49</a>）<br />这也是指接受源于仁的良善之人。<br />②然而，“完全”表示源于仁的真理。因为真理有很多其它来源，但源于仁之善的真理来自主，被称为“完全”，以及“完全人”，如诗篇：<br />谁能寄居你的帐幕？谁能住在你的圣山？就是行为正直、做事公义、心里说实话的人。（诗篇<a href="http://39-27.cn/诗15.1.htm">15:1</a>-<a href="http://39-27.cn/诗15.2.htm">2</a>）<br />这描述的是完全人。<br />圣洁的人，你以圣洁待他；完全的人，你以完全待他。（诗篇<a href="http://39-27.cn/诗18.25.htm">18:25</a>）<br />“完全的人”就是由于圣洁而圣洁之人，即由于仁之善而良善之人。<br />耶和华未尝留下一样好处不给那些行动正直的人。（诗篇<a href="http://39-27.cn/诗84.11.htm">84:11</a>）<br />③“完全人”就是由于良善而真诚之人，即所言所行皆出于仁之真的人。这一点从以下事实清楚看出来，即“行”、“道路”，以及论及真理时所用的“正直”这些词频繁出现，它们被用到完全人的身上，如诗篇：<br />我要指教完全的道。你几时到我这里来呢？我要存完全的心行在我家中。（诗篇<a href="http://39-27.cn/诗101.2.htm">101:2</a>）<br />还有：<br />行为完全的，他要伺候我。（诗篇<a href="http://39-27.cn/诗101.6.htm">101:6</a>）<br /><br />行为完全、遵行耶和华律法的，这人便为有福！（诗篇<a href="http://39-27.cn/诗119.1.htm">119:1</a>）<br />愿纯全正直保守我。（诗篇<a href="http://39-27.cn/诗25.21.htm">25:21</a>）<br />再有：<br />你要细察那完全人，观看那正直人，因为和平人有好结局。（诗篇<a href="http://39-27.cn/诗37.37.htm">37:37</a>）<br />从上述经文清楚可知，行善者被称为“公义”，而行“善之真”，即行“审判与正义”者被称为“完全”。“圣洁”与“正义”是信的属天层面；“完全”与“审判”是由此而来的属灵层面。</p>

<p><strong>[NCE]612.</strong> The meaning of Noah was a just and upright man in his generation as the fact that the church was one that could be endowed with feelings of charity is established by the symbolism of just and upright. Being just has to do with the good involved in charity and upright with the truth involved in it. The same meaning can also be seen from the distinguishing feature of that church, which was charity, as will be discussed later [<a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_612/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_640" target=_top>640</a>, <a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_612/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_765" target=_top>765</a>], with the Lord's divine mercy.<br />The fact that being just has to do with the good involved in charity and upright with the truth involved in it can be seen from the Word, as in Isaiah:<br />They will seek me every day and desire a knowledge of my ways, as a nation that performs justice and does not abandon the rightful judgment of its God. They will ask me about judging justly; they will want God to come close. (<a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_612/bible_king-james-version_isaiah_58_2" target=_top>Isaiah 58:2</a>)<br />Judgment stands for the things advocated by truth, and justice for the things urged by good. Performing judgment and justice became a kind of standard formula that meant doing what is true and good; examples appear in <a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_612/bible_king-james-version_isaiah_56_1" target=_top>Isaiah 56:1</a>; <a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_612/bible_king-james-version_jeremiah_22_3" target=_top>Jeremiah 22:3</a>, <a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_612/bible_king-james-version_jeremiah_22_13" target=_top>13</a>, <a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_612/bible_king-james-version_jeremiah_22_15" target=_top>15</a>; <a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_612/bible_king-james-version_jeremiah_23_5" target=_top>23:5</a>; <a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_612/bible_king-james-version_jeremiah_33_15" target=_top>33:15</a>; and <a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_612/bible_king-james-version_ezekiel_33_14" target=_top>Ezekiel 33:14</a>, <a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_612/bible_king-james-version_ezekiel_33_16" target=_top>16</a>, <a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_612/bible_king-james-version_ezekiel_33_19" target=_top>19</a>. The Lord said:<br />The just will glow like the sun in my Father's kingdom. (<a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_612/bible_king-james-version_matthew_13_43" target=_top>Matthew 13:43</a>)<br />The just stand for people endowed with charity. And in a passage concerning the end of the era:<br />The angels will go out and separate the evil from the midst of the just. (<a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_612/bible_king-james-version_matthew_13_49" target=_top>Matthew 13:49</a>)<br />Here too the just stand for those who display the good that comes of charity.<br />[2] An upright person, however, symbolizes the truth that grows out of charity. Truth can originate in many other places, but truth that grows out of the good embraced by charity and received from the Lord — this truth is called whole or upright and is referred to as the upright individual, or a person of integrity. One example appears in David:<br />Those who will stay in your tent, who will live on your holy mountain, are those walking in integrity and doing justice and speaking truth in their hearts. (<a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_612/bible_king-james-version_psalms_15_1-2" target=_top>Psalms 15:1-2</a>)<br />This portrays the upright person. In the same author:<br />With the holy person you bear yourself in a holy manner; with the upright man you show yourself to be upright. (<a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_612/bible_king-james-version_psalms_18_25" target=_top>Psalms 18:25</a>)<br />The upright man is upright in consequence of the holiness or goodness embodied in charity. In the same author:<br />Jehovah will not withhold what is good from those who walk in integrity. (<a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_612/bible_king-james-version_psalms_84_11" target=_top>Psalms 84:11</a>)<br />[3] The upright individual is one whom goodness inspires to be truthful, or in other words, a person who speaks and acts on truth out of love for others; and this is clear from the way the Word speaks of uprightness. Often it uses the words walk, path [or way], and right or rectitude in connection with the upright person or with integrity, and these words relate to truth. In David, for instance:<br />I will instruct the upright person about the path — how long it takes to reach me. I will walk in the integrity of my heart in the middle of my house. (<a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_612/bible_king-james-version_psalms_101_2" target=_top>Psalms 101:2</a>)<br />And in the same psalm:<br />The one who walks the path of the upright person, that is the one who will wait on me. (<a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_612/bible_king-james-version_psalms_101_6" target=_top>Psalms 101:6</a>)<br />Elsewhere in the same author:<br />A blessing on those who are upright in their path, walking in Jehovah's law! (<a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_612/bible_king-james-version_psalms_119_1" target=_top>Psalms 119:1</a>)<br />In the same author:<br />Integrity and rectitude will guard me. (<a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_612/bible_king-james-version_psalms_25_21" target=_top>Psalms 25:21</a>)<br />Again in the same author:<br />Observe what is upright and watch what is right, because a man's final possession is peace. (<a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_612/bible_king-james-version_psalms_37_37" target=_top>Psalms 37:37</a>)<br />All of this establishes the fact that justice is ascribed to one who does what is good and uprightness to one who acts on the truth that springs from goodness; and this is the same as performing justice and judgment. Holiness and justice are the heavenly aspect of faith, while integrity and judgment are the spiritual aspect that develops out of the heavenly aspect. </p>
<p align="center"><b>Potts(1905-1910) 612</b></p><p><b>612.</b>
Noah was a man righteous and perfect* in his generations. That this signifies that he was such that he could be endowed with charity, is evident from the signification of "just and perfect" "just" (or 
"righteous") having regard to the good of charity, and "perfect" to the truth of charity; and also from the essential of that church being charity, concerning which, of the Lord's Divine mercy hereafter. 
That "just" (or "righteous") has regard to the good of charity, and "perfect" to the truth of charity, is evident from the Word, as in Isaiah: </p>
<p>     They will seek Me daily and desire knowledge 
of My ways, as a nation that doeth righteousness, and forsaketh not the judgment of their God; they will ask of Me the judgments of righteousness, and will long for the approach of God (Isa. 58:2). Here 
"judgment" denotes the things which are of truth, and "righteousness" those which are of good. "Doing judgment and righteousness" became as it were an established formula for doing what is true and 
good (as in Isa. 56:1; Jer. 22:3, 13, 15; 23:5; 33:14, 16, 19). The Lord said: </p>
<p>     The righteous** shall shine forth as the sun, in the kingdom of My father (Matt. 13:43), "the righteous" meaning 
those who are endowed with charity; and concerning the consummation of the age He said: </p>
<p>     The angels shall go forth and shall sever the wicked from among the righteous (Matt. 13:49). Here also the 
"righteous" denote those who are in the good of charity.  [2] But "perfect" signifies the truth which is from charity, for there is truth from many another origin; but that which is from the good 
of charity from the Lord is called "perfect" and a "perfect man" as in David: </p>
<p>     Who shall sojourn in Thy tent, who shall dwell in the mountain of Thy holiness? He that walketh perfect, and worketh 
righteousness, and speaketh the truth in his heart (Ps. 15:1-2). The "perfect" [or "complete"] man is here described. Again: </p>
<p>       With the holy Thou wilt show Thyself holy; with the perfect man 
Thou wilt show Thyself perfect (Ps. 18:25),  where the "perfect man" is one who is so from holiness, or the good of charity. And again: </p>
<p>     Jehovah will withhold no good from them that walk in perfectness 
[integritate] (Ps. 84:11). [3] That a "perfect man" is one who is true from good, or who speaks and does truth from charity, is evident from the words "walk" and "way" being often applied to 
what is perfect, that is, to wholeness or entirety, and also the words "upright" or "uprightness" which words pertain to truth. As in David: </p>
<p>     I will teach the perfect in the way how far he shall 
come unto me. I will walk within my house in the perfectness of my heart (Ps. 101:2); </p>
<p>and in the sixth verse: </p>
<p>     He that walketh in the way of the perfect, he shall minister unto me (Ps. 101:6). Again: </p>
<p> 
    Blessed are the perfect in the way, who walk in the law of Jehovah (Ps. 119:1). And again: </p>
<p>     Perfectness and uprightness shall guard me (Ps. 25:21). And in another place: </p>
<p>     Mark 
the perfect man, and behold the upright, for the end of that man is peace (Ps. 37:37). It is evident from these passages that he is called "righteous" who does what is good, and that he is called "perfect" 
who does what is true therefrom, which also is to "do righteousness and judgment." "Holiness" and "righteousness" are the celestial of faith; "perfectness" and "judgment" are the spiritual thence 
derived.  * "Perfect" is used here in the sense of "whole," "entire." Swedenborg's word is integer. [Reviser.] ** The Latin has only one word for our two English words "just" and "righteous" and 
it is the same with "justice" and "righteousness." [Reviser.] </p>

<p align="center"><b>Elliott(1983-1999) 612</b></p><p><b>612.</b>
'Noah was a righteous and blameless man among members of his own generation' means that he was such as could be endowed with charity. This is clear from the meaning of 'righteous' and 'blameless', 'righteous' 
having regard to the good of charity, and 'blameless' to the truth of charity; also from the fact that the essential element of that Church was charity, in the Lord's Divine mercy to be dealt 
with later on. That 'righteous' has regard to the good of charity and 'blameless' to the truth of charity is clear from the Word, as in Isaiah,  </p>
<blockquote>
They will seek Me daily, and will desire the knowledge 
of My ways, as a nation that does righteousness and does not forsake the judgement of their God. They will ask of Me the judgments of righteousness, they will desire the approach of God. <a href="http://bible.gospelcom.net/cgi-bin/bible?passage=Isa%2058:2&amp;version=ESV&amp;interface=print&amp;showfn=yes&amp;showxref">Isa 58:2</a>. 
</blockquote>
<p>Here 
'judgement' stands for things that have to do with truth, and 'righteousness' for those that have to do with good. 'Doing judgement and righteousness' became so to speak a stock phrase for 
truth and good, as in <a href="http://bible.gospelcom.net/cgi-bin/bible?passage=Isa%2056:1&amp;version=ESV&amp;interface=print&amp;showfn=yes&amp;showxref">Isa 56:1</a>; <a href="http://bible.gospelcom.net/cgi-bin/bible?passage=Jer%2022:3,%2013,%2015;%2023:5;%2033:15&amp;version=ESV&amp;interface=print&amp;showfn=yes&amp;showxref">Jer 22:3, 13, 15; 23:5; 33:15</a>; <a href="http://bible.gospelcom.net/cgi-bin/bible?passage=Ezek%2033:14,%2016,%2019&amp;version=ESV&amp;interface=print&amp;showfn=yes&amp;showxref">Ezek 33:14, 16, 19</a>. And the Lord said,  </p>
<blockquote>
The righteous will shine like the sun in the kingdom of their Father. <a href="http://bible.gospelcom.net/cgi-bin/bible?passage=Matt%2013:43&amp;version=ESV&amp;interface=print&amp;showfn=yes&amp;showxref">Matt 13:43</a>.  
</blockquote>
<p>This 
stands for people who are endowed with charity. Also in reference to the close of the age the Lord said,  </p>
<blockquote>
The angels will come out and separate the evil from the midst of the righteous. <a href="http://bible.gospelcom.net/cgi-bin/bible?passage=Matt%2013:49&amp;version=ESV&amp;interface=print&amp;showfn=yes&amp;showxref">Matt 13:49</a>. 
</blockquote>
<p>Here also it stands for people who receive the good that stems from charity.  </p>
<p></p>
<p><b>[2]</b>
 'Blameless' however means the truth that stems from charity. For truth can come from one of many other origins, 
but that which stems from the good of charity deriving from the Lord is called 'blameless' and 'a blameless man', as in David,  </p>
<blockquote>
Who will sojourn in Your tent? Who will dwell on Your holy mountain? 
He who walks blameless and does righteousness and speaks truth in his heart. <a href="http://bible.gospelcom.net/cgi-bin/bible?passage=Ps%2015:1,%202&amp;version=ESV&amp;interface=print&amp;showfn=yes&amp;showxref">Ps 15:1, 2</a>.  
</blockquote>
<p>This describes a person who is blameless. In the same author,  </p>
<blockquote>
With the holy You behave in a holy way, 
and with a blameless man (vir). You show Yourself blameless. <a href="http://bible.gospelcom.net/cgi-bin/bible?passage=Ps%2018:15&amp;version=ESV&amp;interface=print&amp;showfn=yes&amp;showxref">Ps 18:15</a>.  
</blockquote>
<p>Here 'a blameless man' is one who is so by reason of what is holy, that is, good stemming from charity. In the same author, 
 </p>
<blockquote>
Jehovah will withhold no good thing from those walking blamelessly. <a href="http://bible.gospelcom.net/cgi-bin/bible?passage=Ps%2084:11&amp;version=ESV&amp;interface=print&amp;showfn=yes&amp;showxref">Ps 84:11</a>.  
</blockquote>
<p></p>
<p><b>[3]</b>
 A 'blameless' person is one who is true by reason of good, that is, one who speaks and does what is true 
from charity. This is clear from the fact that so many times the words 'walking', 'way', and also 'upright' or 'uprightness', words used in connection with truth, are applied to someone who is blameless 
or to blamelessness, as in David,  </p>
<blockquote>
I will instruct the blameless in the way how far he shall come towards me. I will walk in the blamelessness of my heart within my house. <a href="http://bible.gospelcom.net/cgi-bin/bible?passage=Ps%20101:2&amp;version=ESV&amp;interface=print&amp;showfn=yes&amp;showxref">Ps 101:2</a>.  
</blockquote>
<p>And in 
verse 6 of the same Psalm,  </p>
<p>He who walks in the way of the blameless will serve Me.  </p>
<p>In the same author,  </p>
<blockquote>
Blessed are the blameless in the way, walking in the law of Jehovah. <a href="http://bible.gospelcom.net/cgi-bin/bible?passage=Ps%20119:1&amp;version=ESV&amp;interface=print&amp;showfn=yes&amp;showxref">Ps 119:1</a>.  
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
In 
the same author,   Blamelessness and uprightness will protect me. <a href="http://bible.gospelcom.net/cgi-bin/bible?passage=Ps%2025:21&amp;version=ESV&amp;interface=print&amp;showfn=yes&amp;showxref">Ps 25:21</a>.   
</blockquote>
In the same author,  </p>
<blockquote>
Mark the blameless man, and behold the upright, for the latter end of that man is peace. <a href="http://bible.gospelcom.net/cgi-bin/bible?passage=Ps%2037:37&amp;version=ESV&amp;interface=print&amp;showfn=yes&amp;showxref">Ps 37:37</a>.   
</blockquote>
From these quotations it is clear that someone who does what is good is called 'righteous', while someone who does truth deriving from it, which is the same as 'doing righteousness and judgement', 
is called 'blameless'. 'Holiness and righteousness' belongs on the celestial side of faith, 'blamelessness and judgement' on the derivative spiritual side.  </p>

Quod 'Noah vir justus et integer in generationibus suis' significet quod talis esset ut charitate donari posset, constat a significatione justi et integri, quod 'justus' spectet bonum charitatis, 'integer' 
verum charitatis; tum ab Ecclesiae illius essentiali, quod esset charitas, de qua, ex Divina Domini Misericordia, in sequentibus: quod 'justus' spectet bonum charitatis, et 'integer' verum charitatis, 
constat ex Verbo, ut apud Esaiam, 	Me quovis die quaerent, et scientiam viarum Mearum desiderabunt, velut gens quae justitiam facit, et judicium Dei sui non derelinquit; interrogabunt Me judicia 
justitiae, appropinquationem Dei desiderabunt, lviii 2; </p>
<p>ubi 'judicium' pro illis quae sunt veri, et 'justitia' pro illis quae sunt boni: sollemnis quasi formula facta 'judicium et justitiam facere' 
pro verum et bonum, ut Esai. lvi 1; Jer. xxii 3, 13, 15; xxiii 5; xxxiii 15 Ezech. xxxiii 14, 16, 19. Dominus dixit, 	Justi fulgebunt ut sol in regno Patris sui {1}, Matth. xiii 43; </p>
<p>pro illis qui 
charitate praediti: tum ubi de consummatione saeculi, 	Exibunt angeli, et separabunt malos e medio justorum, ibid. vers. 49; </p>
<p>ubi etiam pro illis qui in bono charitatis sunt.  [2] 'Integer' autem significat 
verum quod ex charitate; verum enim datur ex plurima alia origine, sed quae ex bono charitatis ex Domino, hoc dicitur 'integrum' et 'homo integer'; ut apud Davidem, 	{x}Quis peregrinabitur 
in tentorio Tuo? quis habitabit in monte sanctitatis Tuae, ambulans integer, et faciens 	justitiam, et loquens veritatem in corde suo, Ps. xv 1, 2; </p>
<p>hic describitur integer: apud eundem, 	Cum sancto 
sancte Te geris, cum viro integro integrum Te praebes, Ps. xviii 26 [A.V. 25]; </p>
<p>ubi 'vir integer,' qui ex sancto, seu bono charitatis, talis est: apud eundem, 	Jehovah non prohibebit bonum ambulantibus 
in integritate, Ps. lxxxiv 12 [A.V. 11]. [3]	Quod 'integer' sit qui verus ex bono, seu qui loquitur et facit verum ex charitate, constat ex eo quod pluries applicetur integro seu integritati vox 'ambulare,' 
et 'via,' tum 'rectum seu rectitudo,' quae voces sunt veri, ut apud Davidem, 	Informabo in via integrum quousque veniet ad me; ambulabo mihi in integritate cordis mei in medio domus meae, 
Ps. ci 2: </p>
<p>et 	Ambulans in via integri, hic ministrabit Mihi, ibid. vers. 6: </p>
<p>apud eundem, 	Beati integri via, ambulantes in lege Jehovae,  Ps. cxix 1: </p>

Me, Ps. xxv 21: </p>
<p>apud eundem, 	Observa integrum, et vide rectum, quia postremum viro pax, Ps. xxxvii 37. Ex his constat quod 'justus' dicatur qui facit bonum, et 'integer' qui facit verum inde, 
quod etiam est 'facere justitiam et judicium'; 'sanctitas et justitia' est caeleste fidei, 'integritas et judicium' est spirituale inde. @	1 I has Mei, Gk. auton.  S. has Mei in A.E. 401, H.H. 348,
