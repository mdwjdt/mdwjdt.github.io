<h3 align="center" class="ired">属天的奥秘 第3845节</h3>
<h4 align="center"></h4><p><strong>3845.</strong>“满了这一周”表勤奋努力的继续。这从“满了”和“一周”的含义清楚可知：“满了”在此是指服事或通过服事完成，因而表示勤奋努力（参看<a href="3824.htm">3824</a>节）；“一周”是指状态，以及整个时期（<a href="728.htm">728</a>，<a href="2044.htm">2044</a>节），故在这种情况下是指随后的状态和时期，因而是指继续。至于“一周”的含义，它和“一个月”意思一样（<a href="3814.htm">3814</a>节）。当以单数被提及时，“周”表示前一个状态的结束和下一个状态的开始，因而表示一个新状态，“满了”是指从开始到结束。“一周”之所以和其它一切具体时间一样表示状态，以及时期，是因为一切状态也有自己的时期，也就是开始、继续和结束。然而，在来世，这些并不被感知为时期，而是被感知为状态及其完整周期。从此处明显可知古人如何理解一周，即：从严格意义上说，每个时期都被分成七个阶段，无论这个时期是七天，还是七年或七十年，因而它是长还是短。显而易见，它在此是指七年。由于对古人来说，“七”表示神圣之物（<a href="84.htm">84</a>-<a href="87.htm">87</a>，<a href="395.htm">395</a>，<a href="433.htm">433</a>，<a href="716.htm">716</a>，<a href="881.htm">881</a>节），故“一周”表示一个神圣时期，以及一个时期的神圣。</p>

Fulfill this week. That this signifies a further succession of study, is evident from the signification of "fulfilling," as here being to serve or fulfill by serving, thus study (see n. 3824); and from 
the signification of a "week," as being a state and also an entire period (n. 728, 2044); in the present case therefore a subsequent state and period, consequently what is successive. In regard to 
the signification of a "week," this is the same as with the signification of a "month" (n. 3814), namely, that when it is mentioned in the singular number, it signifies the end of a former and the beginning 
of a subsequent state, thus a new state, to "fulfill" which is to proceed from the beginning to the end. The reason why a "week," like all times specifically, signifies a state and also a period, 
is that all states have also their periods, that is; their beginning, successive progress, and end; yet in the other life these are not perceived as times, but as states and their revolutions. It is 
here very evident what the ancients understood by a week, namely, in a proper sense, every period that was distinguished into seven, whether it was of days, or of years, or of ages; thus whether it 
was great or small. That here it is a period of seven years is manifest; and as with the ancients seven signified that which is holy (n. 84-87, 395, 433, 716, 881), a "week" signified a holy period, and 
also the holiness of a period. </p>

'Complete this week' means the continuance of the diligent effort. This is clear from the meaning of 'completing' here as serving or completing by serving, and so as meaning diligent effort, dealt with 
in <a href="3824.htm">3824</a>; and from the meaning of 'a week' as a state and also a whole period, dealt with in <a href="728.htm">728</a>, <a href="2044.htm">2044</a>, in this case therefore the state and the subsequent period, and so a continuance. What has been 
said in <a href="3814.htm">3814</a> about the meaning of 'a month' applies equally to the meaning of 'a week'. When used in the singular 'week' means the end of some previous state and the beginning of the one that follows 
it, and so a new state; and by the completing of this is meant from its beginning to its end. The reason why 'a week', like every other time-measurement specifically, means a state and also a period 
of time is that all states also have their own individual periods of the beginning, the continuance, and the end. In the next life however these are not perceived as periods of time but as states and 
their integral cycles. Here it is quite evident what 'a week' meant to the ancients, namely - in the proper sense - every period that was divided into seven phases, whether it was a period of seven days 
or of seven years or of seven ages, and so whether it was a long period or a short one. Here it is plainly a period of seven years. And because 'seven' with those people meant that which was holy, 
see <a href="84.htm">84</a>-<a href="87.htm">87</a>, <a href="395.htm">395</a>, <a href="433.htm">433</a>, <a href="716.htm">716</a>, <a href="881.htm">881</a>, 'a week' therefore meant a holy period, and also the holiness of a period. </p>

`Imple septimanam hanc': quod significet adhuc studii successionem, constat a significatione `implere' quod hic {1}sit servire seu implere serviendo, ita quod sit studium, de qua n. 3824; et a significatione 
`septimanae' quod sit status et quoque integra periodus, de qua n. 728, 2044, hic itaque status et periodus sequens, proinde successivum; se habet eum significatione `septimanae' sicut 
cum significatione mensis, de qua n. 3814, quod cum in singulari nominatur, sit finis status prioris et principium status sequentis, ita status novus, quem implere est a principio ad finem; quod `septimana,' 
sicut omnia tempora in specie, sit status et quoque periodus, est quia omnes status etiam suas periodos habent, hoc est, suum principium, successivum et finem, {1}ast haec non ut tempora 
percipiuntur in altera vita, sed ut status et eorum volutiones.  Hic manifeste patet quid per `septimanam' ab antiquis intellectum sit, nempe in proprio sensu omnis periodus distincta in septem, 
sive dierum fuerit, sive annorum, sive saeculorum, ita sive magna fuerit sive parva, hic quod sit periodus septem annorum, patet; et quia `septem' apud illos significabant sanctum, {2}n. 84-87, 395, 
433, 716, 881, `septimana' inde significabat sanctam periodum, et quoque sanctum periodi. @1 est$ @2 at$ @3 i videatur$ </p>
