<h4 align="center"></h4><p><strong>7190.</strong>出埃及记6:2-8.神告诉摩西，对他说，我是耶和华。我从前向亚伯拉罕、以撒、雅各显现为沙代神；至于我名耶和华，我未曾让他们知道。我也与他们立了我的约，要把迦南地，就是他们所寄居的寄居之地，赐给他们。我又听见以色列人因埃及人使他们作工所发的呻吟；我就记起我的约。所以你要对以色列人说，我是耶和华，我要把你们从埃及人的重担下领出来，救你们脱离他们的苦工；我要用伸出来的膀臂藉着大判罚救赎你们。我要以你们为我的百姓，我也要作你们的神，你们要知道我是耶和华你们的神，是把你们埃及的重担下领出来的。我举手应许给亚伯拉罕、以撒、雅各的那地，我要把你们领进去，将那地赐给你们为业：我是耶和华。<br />“神告诉摩西”表某种新的，然而仍延续以前所发生一切的事。“对他说，我是耶和华”表来自神性的确认，这是不可改变的。“我从前向亚伯拉罕、以撒、雅各显现为沙代神”表主在其人身中所经历的试探和忠信之人所经历的试探，以及随后的安慰。“至于我名耶和华，我未曾让他们知道”表那些属于属灵教会的人在试探的状态下没有想到教会所拥有的神性事物。“我也与他们立了我的约”表那时甚至通过主的神性人身存在的结合。“要把迦南地赐给他们”表通过这种结合，他们将被提入天堂。“就是他们所寄居的寄居之地”表信与仁的事物所在之地，他们已经接受关于这些事物的教导，并照之生活。“我又听见以色列人所发的呻吟”表他们因争战所生的痛苦。“因埃及人使他们作工”表因那些沉浸于虚假，努力征服他们的人。“我就记起我的约”表为了结合而从他们当中释放出来。“所以你要对以色列人说”表神的律法能使那些属于主的属灵国度的人去觉察。“我是耶和华”表来自神性的确认。“我要把你们从埃及人的重担下领出来”表主将把他们从那些沉浸于虚假之人的侵扰中释放出来。“救你们脱离他们的苦工”表从征服他们的努力中完全释放出来。“我要用伸出来的膀臂救赎你们”表凭神性能力从地狱领出来。“藉着大判罚”表照着源于主的神性人身的秩序律法。“我要以你们为我的百姓”表他们将被添加到天上那些在那里事奉主的人当中。“我也要作你们的神”表他们也将接受神性。“你们要知道我是耶和华你们的神”表那时意识到主是独一神。“是把你们埃及的重担下领出来的”表把他们从虚假的侵扰当中解救出来的。“我举手应许给亚伯拉罕、以撒、雅各的那地，我要把你们领进去”表凭神性能力提入天堂，主的神性人身是那里的全部。“将那地赐给你们为业”表主在那里的永生。“我是耶和华”表来自神性的确认。</p>

Verses 2-8. And God spoke unto Moses, and said unto him, I am Jehovah; and I appeared unto Abraham, unto Isaac, and unto Jacob, in God Shaddai; and by My name Jehovah I was not known to them. And I also 
set up My covenant with them, to give them the land of Canaan, the land of their sojournings, wherein they sojourned. And moreover I have heard the groaning of the sons of Israel, in that the Egyptians 
make them to serve; and I have remembered My covenant. Wherefore say to the sons of Israel, I am Jehovah, and I will lead you out from under the burdens of the Egyptians, and I will liberate you 
from their service; and I will redeem you with a stretched-out arm, and with great judgments; and I will take you to Me for a people, and I will be to you for God, and ye shall know that I am Jehovah 
your God, who leadeth you out from under the burdens of Egypt. And I will bring you unto the land where I lifted up My hand to give it to Abraham, to Isaac, and to Jacob, and I will give it you for a 
heritage: I am Jehovah.  "And God spoke unto Moses" signifies what is new but continuous with what was before; "and said unto him, I am Jehovah" signifies confirmation from the Divine which is irrevocable; 
and "I appeared unto Abraham, unto Isaac, and unto Jacob, in God Shaddai" signifies the temptations of the Lord as to the Human, and the temptations of the faithful, and afterward consolations; 
"and by My name Jehovah I was not known to them" signifies that they of the spiritual church in a state of temptations did not think of the Divine things of the church; "and I also set up My covenant 
with them" signifies even then conjunction through the Divine Human of the Lord; "to give them the land of Canaan" signifies by means of which conjunction they would be uplifted into heaven; "the land 
of their sojournings, wherein they sojourned" signifies where the things of faith and charity are, concerning which they have been instructed, and according to which they have lived; "and moreover 
I have heard the groaning of the sons of Israel" signifies their grief from the combat; "in that the Egyptians make them to serve" signifies with those who are in falsities, who are endeavoring to subjugate; 
"and I have remembered My covenant" signifies release from them because of conjunction; "wherefore say to the sons of Israel" signifies that the law Divine shall give to those who are of the Lord's 
spiritual kingdom to notice; "I am Jehovah" signifies confirmation from the Divine; "and I will lead you out from under the burdens of the Egyptians" signifies that the Lord will release them from 
the infestations of those who are in falsities; "and I will liberate you from their service" signifies fully from the endeavor to subjugate them; "and I will redeem you with a stretched-out arm" signifies 
leading forth from hell by virtue of Divine power; "and with great judgments" signifies according to the laws of order from the Divine Human of the Lord; "and I will take you to Me for a people" 
signifies that they shall be added to those in heaven who serve the Lord there; "and I will be to you for God" signifies that they shall also receive the Divine; "and ye shall know that I am Jehovah 
your God" signifies a noticing then that the Lord alone is God; "who leadeth you out from under the burdens of Egypt" signifies who has liberated from infestations by falsities; "and I will bring you 
unto the land where I lifted up My hand to give it to Abraham, to Isaac, and to Jacob" signifies an uplifting by the Divine power to heaven, where the Divine Human of the Lord is all; "and I will give 
it you for a heritage" signifies the Lord's life there to eternity; "I am Jehovah" signifies confirmation from the Divine. </p>

Verses 2-8 And God spoke to Moses, and said to him, I am Jehovah. And I appeared to Abraham, to Isaac, and to Jacob, as God Shaddai; and by My name Jehovah I was not known to them. And I also established 
My covenant with them, to give them the land of Canaan, the land of their sojournings in which they sojourned. And also I have heard the groaning of the children of Israel, that the Egyptians make 
them serve; and I have remembered My covenant. Therefore say to the children of Israel, I am Jehovah, and I will lead you out from under the burdens of the Egyptians, and I will deliver you from their 
servitude; and I will redeem you with an outstretched arm, and with great judgements. And I will take you to Myself as a people, and I will be to you a God; and you will know that I am Jehovah your 
God, leading you out from under the burdens of Egypt. And I will bring you to the land concerning which I lifted up My hand<A name="fntext1"></a><A href="#fn1"><sup>a</sup></a> to give it to Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob; and I will give it to you as an inheritance; 
I am Jehovah. </p>
<p>'And God spoke to Moses' means something that is new yet continues what has gone before. 'And said to him, I am Jehovah' means confirmation from the Divine, which is unchangeable. 
'And I appeared to Abraham, to Isaac, and to Jacob, as God Shaddai' means the temptations which the Lord underwent in His Human and the temptations that faithful believers undergo, and the subsequent 
periods of consolation. 'And by My name Jehovah I was not known to them' means that in a state involving temptations those who belonged to the spiritual Church gave no thought to Divine things 
that the Church possesses. 'And I also established My covenant with them' means the joining together that existed even then through the Lord's Divine Human. 'To give them the land of Canaan' means through 
which joining together they are raised into heaven. 'The land of their sojournings in which they sojourned' means where those things reside that are aspects of faith and charity in which they have 
received instruction and which they have practised in life. 'And also I have heard the groaning of the children of Israel' means their distress arising from conflict. 'That the Egyptians make them 
serve means with those steeped in falsities who endeavour to bring them under their control. 'And I have remembered My covenant' means a release from them for the sake of the joining together. 'Therefore 
say to the children of Israel' means that the law of God will enable those who belong to the Lord's spiritual kingdom to discern. 'I am Jehovah' means confirmation from the Divine. 'And I will lead 
you out from under the burdens of the Egyptians' means that the Lord will release them from the molestations of those steeped in falsities. 'And I will deliver you from their servitude' means complete 
release from the endeavour to establish control over them. 'And I will redeem you with an outstretched arm means leading out of hell by Divine power. 'And with great judgements' means in accordance 
with the laws of order that spring from the Lord's Divine Human. 'And I will take you to Myself as a people' means that they will be added to those in heaven who serve the Lord there. 'And I will be 
to you a God' means that they will also receive the Divine. 'And you will know that I am Jehovah your God' means the discernment then that the Lord is the only God. 'Leading you out from under the burdens 
of Egypt' means who has delivered them from molestations by falsities. 'And I will bring you to the land concerning which I lifted up My hand to give it to Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob' means raising 
by Divine power to heaven, where the Lord's Divine Human is the All. 'And I will give it to you as an inheritance' means the Lord's life there lasting forever. 'I am Jehovah' means confirmation from 
the Divine.

erexi foedus Meum cum illis, ad dandum illis terram Canaanem, terram peregrinationum illorum, in qua peregrinati sunt.  Et etiam Ego audivi gemitum filiorum Israelis, quod Aegyptii servire faciant 
illos; et recordatus sum foederis Mei.  Propterea dic filiis Israelis, Ego Jehovah, et educam vos a sub oneribus Aegyptiorum, et liberabo vos a servitio illorum; et redimam vos brachio extenso, et judiciis 
magnis.  Et accipiam vos Mihi ad populum, et ero vobis ad Deum, et cognoscetis quod Ego Jehovah Deus vester, educens vos a sub oneribus Aegypti.  (x)Et deducam vos ad terram, qua sustuli manum Meam

peregrinati sunt' significat ubi illa quae fidei et charitatis, de quibus instructi fuerunt et secundum quae vixerunt: `et etiam Ego audivi gemitum filiorum Israelis' significat illorum dolorem ex pugna: 
`quod Aegyptii servire faciant illos' significat cum illis qui in falsis, qui conantur subjugare: `et recordatus sum foederis Mei' significat quod exemptio ab illis propter conjunctionem: `propterea 
dic filiis Israelis' significat quod lex Divina dabit ut appercipiant illi qui e regno spirituali Domini: (m)`Ego Jehovah' significat confirmationem a Divino:(n) `et educam vos a sub oneribus Aegyptiorum' 
significat quod Dominus eximet illos ab infestationibus illorum qui in falsis: `et liberabo vos e servitio illorum' significat plene a conatu subjugationis illorum: `et redimam vos brachio extenso' 
significat eductionem ab inferno ex Divina potentia: `et judiciis magnis' significat secundum leges ordinis ex Divino Humano Domini: `et accipiam vos Mihi {1}ad populum' significat quod illi adjicientur
