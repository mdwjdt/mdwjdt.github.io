<h3 align="center" class="ired">属天的奥秘 第7563节</h3>
<h4 align="center"></h4><p><strong>7563.</strong>“便叫他的奴仆和牲畜逃进家来”表它们被储存起来，妥善保管在内层中。这从“奴仆”、“牲畜”和“家”的含义清楚可知：“奴仆”是指属世心智中的事物，如刚才所述（<a href="7562.htm">7562</a>节）；“牲畜”是指真理和良善，如前所述（<a href="7556.htm">7556</a>节）；“家”是指从内在存在于人里面的事物，就是来自主的良善和真理被储存起来并妥善保管的地方（<a href="7560.htm">7560</a>节）。由此明显可知，“便叫他的奴仆和牲畜逃进家来”表示在属世心智中的真理和良善，即属于主的事物被收集并储存起来，妥善保管在内层中。</p>

<p align="center"><b>Potts(1905-1910) 7563</b></p><p><b>7563.</b>
Made his servants and his cattle flee unto the houses. That this signifies that they were stored up and reserved in the interiors, is evident from the signification of "servants," as being the things 
in the natural mind (as just above, n. 7562); from the signification of "cattle," as being truth and good (of which also above, n. 7556); and from the signification of "houses," as being the things that 
are within man, where the good and truth from the Lord are stored up and reserved (n. 7560). From this it is evident that by "he made his servants and cattle flee unto the houses" is signified that 
the truths and goods which were in the natural mind, namely, those which are of the Lord, were collected and stored up and reserved in the interiors. </p>

<p align="center"><b>Elliott(1983-1999) 7563</b></p><p><b>7563.</b>
'Caused his servants and his livestock to flee to the houses' means that they were stored away and placed in safe keeping interiorly. This is clear from the meaning of 'servants' as the things in the 
natural mind, as immediately above in <a href="7562.htm">7562</a>; from the meaning of 'livestock' as truth and good, also dealt with above, in <a href="7556.htm">7556</a>; and from the meaning of 'the houses' as the things present inwardly in a 
person, where goodness and truth from the Lord are stored away and placed in safe keeping, dealt with in <a href="7560.htm">7560</a>. From this it is evident that 'he caused his servants and his livestock to flee to the houses' 
means that the truths and forms of good which are in the natural mind, that is to say, the things which are the Lord's, have been gathered and have been stored away and placed in safe keeping interiorly. </p>

</p><b>7563.</b>
`Fugere fecit servos suos et pecus suum ad domos': quod significet quod recondita et reservata sint in interioribus, constat ex significatione `servorum' quod sint illa quae in mente naturali, ut mox 
supra n. 7562; ex significatione `pecoris' quod sit verum et bonum, de qua etiam supra n. 7556; et ex significatione `domuum' quod sint quae intus in homine, ubi bonum et {1}verum a Domino reconduntur 
et reservantur, de qua n. 7560; inde patet quod per `fugere fecit servos suos et pecus suum ad domos' significetur quod vera et bona quae in mente naturali, illa nempe quae Domini sunt, collecta sint 
ac recondita et reservata in interioribus. 	@1 verum altered to vera$ </p>
