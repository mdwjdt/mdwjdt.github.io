<h4 align="center"></h4><p><strong>5793.</strong>创世记44:18-31.犹大挨近他说，我主啊，求你容仆人在我主耳边说一句话，不要向仆人发烈怒，因为你如同法老一样。我主曾问仆人们说，你们有父亲、有兄弟没有？我们对我主说，我们有父亲，一个老人，还有他老年所生的一个孩子，是最小的。他哥哥死了，他母亲只撇下他一人，他父亲疼爱他。你对仆人说，将他带下来到我这里，叫我亲眼看看他。我们对我主说，童子不能离开他父亲，若离开他父亲，他父亲必死。你对仆人说，你们最小的兄弟若不与你们一同下来，你们就不得再见我的面。我们上到你仆人我父亲那里，就把我主的话告诉了他。我们的父亲说，回去，给我们买些粮来。我们就说，我们不能下去；我们最小的兄弟若和我们同往，我们就可以下去；因为我们最小的兄弟若不与我们同往，我们不能见那人的面。你仆人我父亲对我们说，你们知道我的妻子给我生了两个儿子；一个离开我出去了；我说：他必是被撕碎了，直到如今我也没有见他。现在你们又要把这一个从我面前带走，倘若他遭害，那便是你们使我白发苍苍、悲悲惨惨地下坟墓去了。我父亲的灵魂与这童子的灵魂相连，如今我回到你仆人我父亲那里，若没有童子与我们同在，他见童子不在，就必死。你仆人们便使你仆人我们的父亲，白发苍苍、悲悲惨惨地下坟墓去了。<br />“犹大挨近他”表外在人与内在人通过良善交流。“说”表觉知。“我主啊，求你”表恳求。“容仆人在我主耳边说一句话”表恳求接受和垂听。“不要向仆人发烈怒”表免得他转身离开。“因为你如同法老一样”表他掌控属世层。“我主曾问仆人们说”表对他们思维的察觉。“你们有父亲、有兄弟没有”表作为源头的良善和作为方法的真理。“我们对我主说”表相互觉察。“我们有父亲，一个老人”表属灵良善是他们的源头。“还有他老年所生的一个孩子，是最小的”表源于那良善的新真理。“他哥哥死了”表内在良善不在了。“他母亲只撇下他一人”表这是教会所拥有的唯一真理。“他父亲疼爱他”表这真理拥有与来自属世层的属灵良善的联结。“你对仆人说”表被赋予的觉知。“将他带下来到我这里”表这新的真理必须顺服于内在良善。“叫我亲眼看看他”表那时源于良善的真理之流注。“我们对我主说”表相互觉察。“童子不能离开他父亲”表这真理不能与属灵良善分离。“若离开他父亲，他父亲必死”表若分离，教会必灭亡。“你对仆人说”表对这事的觉知。“你们最小的兄弟若不与你们一同下来”表若它不顺服于内在良善。“你们就不得再见我的面”表在这种情况下将没有怜悯，也没有与属世层中的真理的联结。“我们上到你仆人我父亲那里”表朝向属灵良善的提升。“就把我主的话告诉了他”表对这事的了解。“我们的父亲说”表从属灵良善那里所获得的觉知。“回去，给我们买些粮来”表真理之良善要变成他们自己的。“我们就说，我们不能下去”表反对。“我们最小的兄弟若和我们同往，我们就可以下去”表除非实现联结的居间层与他们同在。“因为我们不能见那人的面”表因为将不会有怜悯，也不会有联结。“我们最小的兄弟若不与我们同往”表除非通过居间层。“你仆人我父亲对我们说”表从属灵良善那里所获得的觉知。“你们知道我的妻子给我生了两个儿子”表如果属灵良善就是教会所拥有的东西，那么内在良善与真理就会存在。“一个离开我出去了”表内在良善的看似离开。“我说：他必是被撕碎了”表对它被邪恶与虚假毁灭的觉知。“直到如今我也没有见他”表因为它已经消失了。“现在你们又要把这一个从我面前带走”表如果新的真理也要离开。“倘若他遭害”表由邪恶与虚假所造成。“那便是你们使我白发苍苍、悲悲惨惨地下坟墓去了”表属灵良善，因而教会的内在就要灭亡。“如今我回到你仆人我父亲那里”表对应于内在教会的属灵良善的教会良善。“若没有童子与我们同在”表如果新真理不与他们同在。“我父亲的灵魂与这童子的灵魂相连”表当有更紧密的联结时。“他见童子不在，就必死”表属灵良善就必灭亡。“你仆人们便使你仆人我们的父亲，白发苍苍、悲悲惨惨地下坟墓去了”表教会就全完了。</p>

Verses 18-31. And Judah came near unto him, and said, By me, my lord, let thy servant I pray speak a word in my lord's ears, and let not thine anger be kindled against thy servant; for thou art even 
as Pharaoh. My lord asked his servants, saying, Have ye a father, or a brother? And we said unto my lord, We have a father, an old man, and a child of his old ages, the youngest; and his brother is dead, 
and he alone is left to his mother, and his father loveth him. And thou saidst unto thy servants, Make him come down unto me, and I will set mine eye upon him. And we said unto my lord, The boy cannot 
leave his father; and should he leave his father, he will die. And thou saidst unto thy servants, If your youngest brother come not down with you, ye shall see my faces no more. And it came to pass 
when we came up unto thy servant my father, we told him the words of my lord. And our father said, Return ye, buy us a little food. And we said, We cannot go down; if our youngest brother be with us, 
then will we go down; for we cannot see the man's faces, and our youngest brother he not with us. And thy servant my father said unto us, Ye know that my wife bare me two sons; and the one went out 
from me, and I said, Surely tearing he is torn in pieces; and I have not seen him hitherto: and ye are taking this one also from my faces, and if harm befall him, ye will make my gray hairs go down in 
evil to the grave. And now when I come to thy servant my father, and the boy he not with us, and his soul is bound in his soul; and it shall come to pass when he seeth that the boy is not, that he will 
die; and thy servants will make thy servant our father's gray hairs go down in sorrow to the grave. "And Judah came near unto him," signifies the communication of the external man with the internal 
through good; "and said," signifies perception; "By me, my lord," signifies entreaty; "let thy servant I pray speak a word in my lord's ears," signifies for reception and hearing; "and let not thine 
anger he kindled against thy servant," signifies lest he turn away; "for thou art even as Pharaoh," signifies that it has dominion over the natural; "my lord asked his servants, saying," signifies perception 
of their thought; "Have ye a father, or a brother?" signifies that there is good which is the source, and truth which is the means; "and we said unto my lord," signifies reciprocal perception; 
"We have a father, an old man," signifies that they have spiritual good as the source; "and a child of his old ages, the youngest," signifies truth therefrom which is new; "and his brother is dead," 
signifies that internal good is not; "and he alone is left to his mother," signifies that this is the only truth of the church; "and his father loveth him," signifies that it has conjunction with spiritual 
good from the natural; "and thou saidst unto thy servants," signifies perception given; "Make him come down unto me," signifies that the new truth must be in subjection to internal good; "and I 
will set mine eye upon him," signifies influx then of truth from good "and we said unto my lord," signifies reciprocal perception; "The boy cannot leave his father," signifies that this truth cannot 
he separated from spiritual good; "and should be leave his father, he will die," signifies that if it were separated the church would perish; "and thou saidst unto thy servants," signifies perception 
concerning that thing; "If your youngest brother come not down with you," signifies if it be not subject to internal good; "ye shall see my faces no more," signifies that there will be no mercy, and no 
conjunction with truths in the natural; "and it came to pass when we came up unto thy servant my father," signifies elevation to spiritual good; "we told him the words of my lord," signifies knowledge 
of this thing; "and our father said," signifies perception from spiritual good; "Return ye, buy us a little food," signifies that the good of truth should he appropriated; "and we said, We cannot go 
down," signifies objection; "if our youngest brother be with us, then will we go down," signifies unless there be with them a conjoining intermediate; "for we cannot see the man's faces," signified 
because there will be no mercy or conjunction; "and our youngest brother he not with us," signifies except by means of an intermediate; "and thy servant my father said unto us," signifies perception from 
spiritual good; "Ye know that my wife bare me two sons," signifies that if there be spiritual good which is of the church, there will he internal good and truth; "and the one went out from me," signifies 
the seeming departure of internal good; "and I said, Surely tearing he is torn in pieces," signifies perception that it perished by evils and falsities; "and I have not seen him hitherto," signifies 
because it has vanished; "and ye are taking this one also from my faces," signifies if the new truth also should depart; "and if harm befall him," signifies by evils and falsities; "and ye will 
make my gray hairs go down in evil to the grave," signifies that spiritual good, and thus the internal of the church, would perish; "and now when I come to thy servant my father," signifies the good 
of the church corresponding to the spiritual good of the internal church; "and the boy he not with us," signifies if the new truth is not with them; "and his soul is bound in his soul," signifies since 
there is a close conjunction; "and it shall come to pass when he seeth that the boy is not, that he will die," signifies that spiritual good will perish; "and thy servants will make thy servant our 
father's gray hairs go down in sorrow to the grave," signifies that all will be over with the church. </p>

Verses 18-31 And Judah approached him and said, By me,<A name="fntext1"></a><A href="#fn1"><sup>a</sup></a> my lord, let your servant, I beg you, speak a word in my lord's ears, and do not let your anger burn against your servant, for as you are, so is 
Pharaoh. My lord questioned his servants, saying, Have you a father, or a brother? And we said to my lord, We have a father, an old man, and a child of his old age, the youngest one; and his brother 
is dead, and he alone is left to his mother, and his father loves him. And you said to your servants, Cause him to come down to me, and I will set my eye on him. And we said to my lord, The boy cannot 
leave his father; and should he leave his father, [his father] will die. And you said to your servants, If your youngest brother does not come down with you, you will not see my face again. And so it 
was, when we went up to your servant my father, that we told him my lord's words. And our father said, Return, buy us a little food. And we said, We cannot go down; if our youngest brother is with us 
we will go down, for we cannot see the man's face if our youngest brother is not with us. And your servant my father said to us, You know that my wife bore me two sons. And one went out from me, and 
I said, He has surely been torn to pieces; and I have not seen him since. And you are taking this one also from before my face, and should harm befall him, you will cause my grey hair to go down in evil 
to the grave. And now, when I come to your servant my father and the boy is not with us, and his soul being bound up with his soul, it will be, when he sees that the boy is not there, that he will 
die, and your servants will cause the grey hair of your servant our father to go down in sorrow to the grave. </p>
<p>'And Judah approached him' means a communication of the external man with the internal 
through good. 'And said' means perception. 'By me, my lord' means a pleading. 'Let your servant, I beg you, speak a word in my lord's ears' means to be received and heard. 'And do not let your anger 
burn against your servant' means lest he turn away. 'For as you are, so is Pharaoh' means that he has control over the natural. 'My lord questioned his servants, saying' means perception of their thought. 
'Have you a father, or a brother?' means the good that is the source, and the truth that is the means. 'And we said to my lord' means a reciprocated perception. 'We have a father, an old man' means 
that spiritual good is their source. 'And a child of his old age, the youngest one' means truth that is new, springing from that good. 'And his brother is dead' means that internal good does not exist. 
'And he alone is left to his mother' means that this is the only truth the Church possesses. 'And his father loves him' means that this truth exists joined to spiritual good from the natural. 'And 
you said to your servants' means an imparted perception. 'Cause him to come down to me' means that this truth which is new must be made subject to internal good. 'And I will set my eye on him' means 
a flowing in at this point of truth from good. 'And we said to my lord' means a reciprocated perception. 'The boy cannot leave his father' means that that truth cannot be separated from spiritual good. 
'And should he leave his father, [his father] will die' means that, if separated, the Church would perish. 'And you said to your servants' means a perception regarding this matter. 'If your youngest 
brother does not come down with you' means if it is not made subject to internal good. 'You will not see my face again' means that in that case no mercy is at hand and there is no joining to truths 
in the natural. 'And so it was, when we went up to your servant my father' means a raising up to spiritual good. 'That we told him my lord's words' means an awareness of this matter. 'And our father said' 
means perception received from spiritual good. 'Return, buy us a little food' means that the good of truth should be made their own. 'And we said, We cannot go down' means an objection. 'If our youngest 
brother is with us we will go down' means unless the intermediary that accomplishes the joining together is with them. 'For we cannot see the man's face' means since no mercy is at hand and there 
is no joining together. 'If our youngest brother is not with us' means except through the intermediary. 'And your servant my father said to us' means perception received from spiritual good. 'You 
know that my wife bore me two sons' means if spiritual good is what the Church possesses, internal good and truth will exist. 'And one went out from me means an apparent departure of internal good. 'And 
I said, He has surely been torn to pieces' means a perception that it was destroyed by evils and falsities. 'And I have not seen him since' means because it has disappeared. 'And you are taking this 
one also from before my face' means if the new truth likewise departs. 'And should harm befall him' means caused by evils and falsities. 'You will cause my grey hair to go down in evil to the grave 
means that spiritual good and so the internal aspect of the Church is going to perish. 'And now, when I come to your servant my father' means the good of the Church corresponding to the spiritual good 
which is that of the internal Church. 'And the boy is not with us' means if the new truth is not with them. 'And his soul being bound up with his soul' means when more closely joined together. 'It will 
be, when he sees that the boy is not there, that he will die' means that spiritual good will perish. 'And your servants will cause the grey hair of your servant our father to go down in sorrow to the 
grave' means that the Church will be done for.

Vers. 18-31.  Et accessit ad eum Jehudah, et dixit, Per me, domine mi, loquatur quaeso servus tuus verbum in auribus domini mei, et ne accendatur ira tua in servum tuum, quia sicut tu sicut Pharaoh. 
Dominus meus interrogavit servos suos, dicendo, An sit vobis pater vel frater? Et diximus ad dominum meum, Est nobis pater senex, et natus senectutum minimus, et frater ejus mortuus, et relictus ille 
solus matri suae, et pater ejus amat illum. Et dixisti ad servos tuos, Descendere facite illum ad me, et ponam oculum meum super illum. Et diximus ad dominum meum, Non potest puer relinquere patrem suum, 
et relinquat patrem suum, et morietur. Et dixisti ad servos tuos, Si non descendat frater vester minimus cum vobis, non addetis videre facies meas. Et fuit, cum ascendimus ad servum tuum patrem meum, 
et indicavimus ei verba domini mei. Et dixit pater noster, Revertimini, emite nobis parum cibi. Et diximus, Non possumus descendere, si sit frater noster minimus cum nobis, et descendemus, quia non 
possumus videre facies viri, et frater {1}noster minimus non ille cum nobis. Et dixit servus tuus pater meus ad nos, Vos nostis quod binos pepererit mihi uxor mea. Et exivit unus (c)a me, et dixi, 
Verumtamen discerpendo discerptus est, et non vidi illum huc usque. Et sumitis etiam hunc a cum faciebus meis, et accidat illi damnum, et descendere facietis canitiem meam in malo sepulcrum. Et nunc sicut 
venero ad servum tuum patrem meum, et puer non ille cum nobis, et anima ejus vincta in anima ejus. Et erit, sicut videre eum quod non puer, et morietur, et descendere facient servi tui canitiem servi 
tui patris nostri in maerore sepulcrum. `Et accessit ad eum Jehudah' significat communicationem externi hominis cum interno per bonum: `et dixit' significat perceptionem: `Per me, domine mi' significat

objectionem: `si sit frater noster minimus cum nobis, et descendemus' significat nisi una sit medium conjungens: `quia non possumus videre facies viri' significat quia nulla misericordia et conjunctio: 
`et frater noster minimus non ille cum nobis' significat {4}nisi per medium: `et dixit servus tuus pater meus ad nos' significat perceptionem ex bono spirituali: `Vos nostis quod binos pepererit 
mihi uxor mea' significat si bonum spirituale sit quod Ecclesiae, quod internum bonum et verum erit: `et exivit unus a me' significat (x)discessionem apparentem interni boni: `et dixi, Verumtamen

etiam verum novum discedat: `et accidat illi damnum' significat a malis et falsis: `et descendere facietis canitiem meam in malo sepulcrum' significat quod periturum bonum spirituale et sic internum Ecclesiae:
