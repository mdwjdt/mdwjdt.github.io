<h3 align="center" class="ired">属天的奥秘 第914节</h3>
<h4 align="center"></h4><p><strong>914.</strong>创世记8:18，19 于是，挪亚出来了，他的儿子、妻子和儿媳都与他一起出来了。一切野兽，一切爬物，一切飞鸟和地上的一切爬行物，各从其类，它们也都出了方舟。<br />“挪亚出来了”表事就这样成了。“挪亚和他的儿子”表古教会成员。“与他一起的他的妻子和儿媳”表教会本身。“一切野兽和一切爬物”表他的良善，“野兽”表属于内在人的良善，“爬物”表属于外在人的良善。“一切飞鸟和地上的一切爬行物”表真理，“飞鸟”表属于内在人的真理，“地上的一切爬行物”表属于外在人的真理。“各从其类”表成双成对。“它们也都出了方舟”和前面一样，表事就这样成了，同时表自由的状态。</p>

<p><strong>[NCE]914.</strong> <a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_914/bible_king-james-version_genesis_8_18-19" target=_top>Genesis 8:18-19</a>. And Noah and his sons went out, as did his wife and his sons' wives with him, every wild animal, every creeping thing, and every bird — everything creeping on the earth. By their families they went out of the ark.<br />Noah and his sons means the people of the ancient church. Went out means came into being. His wife and his sons' wives with him means the church itself. Every wild animal and every creeping thing symbolize good things in them — the wild animal, good things in the inner self, and the creeping thing, good things in the outer self. And every bird, everything creeping on the earth, symbolizes truth — the bird, truth in the inner self, and the thing creeping on the earth, truth in the outer self. By their families means pairs. They went out of the ark means, as above, that they all came into being; and at the same time it symbolizes a condition of freedom. </p>

Verse 18, 19. And Noah went forth, and his sons, and his wife, and his sons' wives with him; every wild animal, every creeping thing, and every fowl, everything that creepeth upon the earth, according 
to their families, went forth out of the ark. "Went forth" signifies that it was so done; by "Noah and his sons" is signified the man of the Ancient Church; by "his wife and his sons' wives with him" 
is signified that church itself. "Every wild animal, every creeping thing" signify his goods; "wild animal" the goods of the internal man; "creeping thing" the goods of the external man; "and every 
fowl, everything that creepeth upon the earth" signify truths; "fowl" the truths of the internal man; "that creepeth upon the earth" the truths of the external man; "according to their families" signifies 
pairs; "went forth out of the ark" signifies as before that it was so done, and at the same time it signifies a state of freedom. </p>

Verses 18, 19 And Noah went out, and his sons, and his wife, and his sons' wives with him. Every wild animal, every creeping thing, and every bird, everything creeping over the earth - according to their 
families they went out of the ark.  </p>
<p>'He went out' means that this did in fact happen. 'Noah and his sons' means the member of the Ancient Church. 'His wife and his sons' wives with him' means 
the Church itself. 'Every wild animal and every creeping thing' means his goods, 'wild animals' goods belonging to the internal man, 'creeping things' goods belonging to the external. 'And every bird, 
and everything creeping over the earth' means truths, 'bird' truths belonging to the internal man, 'thing creeping over the earth' truths belonging to the external. 'According to their families means 
pairs. 'They went out of the ark' means, as previously, that these things did in fact happen; and at the same time a state of freedom is meant.  </p>

</p><b>914.</b>
Vers. 18, 19.  Et exivit Noah, et filii ejus, et uxor ejus, et uxores filiorum ejus cum illo.  Omnis fera, omne reptile, et omnis avis, omne repens super terra; secundum familias suas exiverunt de arca. 
'Exivit' significat quod factus: per 'Noahum et filios ejus' significatur homo Antiquae Ecclesiae: per 'uxorem ejus et uxores filiorum ejus cum illo' significatur ipsa Ecclesia: 'omnis fera et omne 
reptile' significant bona ejus; 'fera' bona interni hominis, 'reptile' bona externi: 'et omnis avis, omne repens super terra,' significant vera: 'avis' vera interni hominis, 'repens super terra' vera 
externi: 'secundum familias suas' significant paria: 'exiverunt de arca' significant, ut prius, ita facta; et simul statum libertatis. </p>
