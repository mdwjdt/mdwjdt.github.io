<h4 align="center"></h4><p><strong>2465.</strong>创世记19:31-36. 大女儿对小女儿说，我们的父亲老了，地上又没有男人可以按着全地上的常规进到我们这里。来！我们可以叫我们的父亲喝酒，与他同寝，好从我们的父亲使种存活。于是，那夜她们叫父亲喝酒，大女儿就进去和她父亲同寝。她几时躺下，几时起来，父亲都不知道。第二天，大女儿对小女儿说，看哪，我昨夜与我父亲同寝，今夜我们再叫他喝酒，你可以进去与他同寝，好从我们的父亲使种存活。于是，那夜她们又叫父亲喝酒，小女儿起来与她父亲同寝。她几时躺下，几时起来，父亲都不知道。这样，罗得的两个女儿都从她们的父亲怀了孕。<br />“大女儿对小女儿说”在此和前面一样，表情感：“大女儿”表对这种良善的情感，“小女儿”表对这种虚假的情感。“我们的父亲老了，地上又没有男人”表何为良善、何为真理不再为人所知。“进到我们这里”表这些情感可以与之结合。“按着全地上的常规”表照着教义，“地”是指教会。“来！我们可以叫我们的父亲喝酒”表它们要用“酒”所表示的虚假浸染这种良善。“与他同寝”表它们要以这种方式结合。“好从我们的父亲使种存活”表一种新的教会将以这种方式出现。<br />“于是，她们叫父亲喝酒”表它们以虚假浸染这种良善。“那夜”表当一切事物都被笼罩在如此大的昏暗中时。“大女儿就进去”表对这种良善的情感。“和她父亲同寝”表这二者以这种方式被联结起来。“她几时躺下，几时起来，父亲都不知道”表这种一般的良善只知道事情就是这样。“第二天”表后来。“大女儿对小女儿说”表对这种良善的情感说服虚假。“看哪，我昨夜与我父亲同寝”表它们就这样被结合起来。“今夜我们再叫他喝酒”在此和前面一样，表它们以虚假浸染这种良善，这时，一切事物都被笼罩在如此大的昏暗中。<br />“你可以进去与他同寝”表这些事物也可以被联结起来。“好从我们的父亲使种存活”在此和前面一样，表一种新的教会将以这种方式出现。“于是，那夜她们又叫父亲喝酒”表在那种昏暗的状态下，它们以虚假浸染这种良善。“小女儿起来与她父亲同寝”表对虚假的情感同样如此行，好叫虚假看似真理，这二者以这种方式结合。“她几时躺下，几时起来，父亲都不知道”在此和前面一样，表这种一般的良善只知道事情就是这样。“这样，罗得的两个女儿都从她们的父亲怀了孕”表诸如“摩押”和“亚扪人”所表示这种宗教信仰即源于此。</p>

Verses 31-36. And the firstborn said unto the younger, Our father is old, and there is no man in the earth to come unto us according to the way of all the earth. Come, let us make our father drink wine, 
and let us lie with him, and let us quicken seed from our father. And they made their father drink wine that night; and the firstborn went in, and lay with her father; and he knew not when she lay 
down, nor when she arose. And it came to pass on the morrow, that the firstborn said unto the younger, Behold, I lay yesternight with my father; let us make him drink wine this night also, and go thou 
in and lie with him, and let us quicken seed from our father. And they made their father drink wine that night also; and the younger arose, and lay with him; and he knew not when she lay down, nor when 
she arose. And the two daughters of Lot conceived by their father.  [2] " The firstborn said unto the younger," signifies here as before the affections; the firstborn the affection of such good, 
the younger the affection of such falsity; "our father is old, and there is no man in the earth," signifies that it is no longer known what good is, and what truth is; "to come unto us," signifies with 
which they might be conjoined; "according to the way of all the earth," signifies according to doctrinal things; the "earth" is the church. "Come, let us make our father drink wine," signifies that 
they should imbue such good with falsities, which are the "wine;" "and let us lie with him," signifies that in this way they would be conjoined; "and let us quicken seed from our father," signifies that 
so there would be a newness of a sort of church.  [3] "And they made their father drink wine," signifies that they imbued such good with falsities; "that night," signifies when all things were in 
such obscurity; "and the firstborn went in," signifies the affection of such good; "and lay with her father," signifies that thus they were brought into accordance; "and he knew not when she lay down 
nor when she arose," signifies that such a general kind of good knew no otherwise than that it was so. "And it came to pass on the morrow," signifies afterwards "that the firstborn said unto the younger," 
signifies that the affection of such good persuaded the falsity; "Behold, I lay yesternight with my father," signifies that thus they were conjoined; "let us make him drink wine this night also," 
signifies here as before that they imbued such good with falsities when everything was in such obscurity; [4] "and go thou in and lie with him," signifies that these things also should be conjoined; 
"and let us quicken seed from our father," signifies here as before that so there would be a newness of a sort of church. "And they made their father drink wine that night also," signifies that in that 
obscure state they imbued such good with falsities; "and the younger arose and lay with him," signifies that the affection of falsity did in like manner, so that falsities appeared as truths, and in 
this way they were conjoined; "and he knew not when she lay down nor when she arose," signifies that such general good knew no otherwise than that it was so. "And the two daughters of Lot conceived by 
their father," signifies that hence was the origin of such a religion as is signified by Noah and the son of Ammon. </p>

Verses 31-36 And the firstborn said to the younger, Our father is old, and there is no man in the land to come to us, according to the way of all the earth. Come, let us make our father drink wine, and 
let us lie with him and let us keep seed alive by our father. And they made their father drink wine that night, and the firstborn came and lay with her father; and he did not know when she lay down 
and when she rose up. And so it was on the next day, that the firstborn said to the younger, Behold, I lay last night with my father; let us make him drink wine again tonight, and come, lie with him, 
and let us keep seed alive by our father. And they made their father drink wine that night also; and the younger rose up and lay with him; and he did not know when she lay down and when she rose up. 
And the two daughters of Lot conceived by their father. </p>

<p><b>[2]</b>
 'The firstborn said to the younger' here, as previously, means affections - 'the firstborn' meaning the affection for that kind of good, 
'the younger' the affection for that kind of falsity. 'Our father is old, and there is no man in the land' means that it is no longer known what good is and what truth is. 'To come to us' means to which 
those affections might be joined. 'According to the way of all the earth' means according to matters of doctrine, 'earth' being the Church. 'Come, let us make our father drink wine' means that they 
might saturate such good with falsities, meant by the wine. 'And let us lie with him' means that in this way they would be joined together.  </p>
<p></p>
<p><b>[3]</b>
 'And let us keep seed alive by our father' means that 
in this way a new kind of a Church would emerge. 'And they made their father drink wine' means that they saturated such good with falsities. 'That night' means when all things were enveloped in so 
much obscurity. 'And the firstborn came' means the affection for. that kind of good. 'And lay with her father' means that in this way the two were brought together. 'And he did not know when she lay down 
and when she rose up' means that such general good knew no other than that it was so. 'And on the next day' means afterwards. 'The firstborn said to the younger' means that the affection for such 
good persuaded the falsity. 'Behold, I lay last night with my father' means that thus they had been joined together. 'Let us make him drink wine again tonight' means here, as previously, that they saturated 
such good with falsities, at a time when everything was enveloped in so much obscurity. 'And come, lie with him' means that these might be joined together as well. </p>
<p></p>
<p><b>[4]</b>
 'And let us keep seed 
alive by our father' here, as previously, means that in this way a new kind of a Church would emerge. 'And they made their father drink wine that night also' means that in that obscure state they saturated 
such good with falsities. 'And the younger rose up and lay with him' means that the affection for falsity acted in a similar fashion, so that falsities looked like truths, and the two were in this 
way joined together. 'And he did not know when she lay down and when she rose up' here, as previously, means that such a general type of good knew no other than that it was so. 'And the two daughters 
of Lot conceived by their father' means that this was how such a religion as that meant by 'Moab' and 'the son of Ammon' arose. </p>

Vers. 31-36.  Et dixit primogenita ad minorem, Pater noster senex, et vir nullus in terra, ad veniendum ad nos, secundum viam totius terrae. Veni, propinemus patri nostro vinum, et cubemus cum eo, et 
vivificemus de patre nostro semen. Et propinaverunt patri suo vinum in nocte illa, et venit primogenita, et cubuit cum patre suo, et non cognovit in cubare ejus et in surgere ejus. Et fuit a crastino, 
et dixit primogenita ad minorem, Ecce cubui heri cum patre meo, propinemus ei vinum etiam nocte hac, et veni, cuba cum eo, et vivificemus de patre nostro semen. Et propinaverunt etiam in nocte illa 
patri eorum vinum, et surrexit minor, et cubuit cum eo, et non cognovit in cubare ejus et in surgere ejus. Et conceperunt binae filiae Loti de patre suo.  [2] `Dixit primogenita ad minorem' significat, 
hic ut prius, affectiones, `primogenita' affectionem talis boni, `minor' affectionem talis falsi: `pater noster senex, et vir nullus in terra' significat quod non sciatur amplius quid bonum et quid 
verum: `ad veniendum ad nos' significat quibus conjungerentur: `secundum viam totius terrae' significat secundum doctrinalia; `terra' est Ecclesia: `veni, propinemus patri nostro vinum' significat quod 
imbuerent bonum tale falsis, quae sunt vinum: `et cubemus cum eo' significat quod sic conjungerentur: `et vivificemus de patre nostro semen' significat quod sic novum cujusdam Ecclesiae: [3] `et propinaverunt 
patri suo vinum' significat quod imbuerint tale bonum falsis: `in nocte illa' significat cum omnia essent in tanto obscuro: `et venit primogenita' significat affectionem talis boni: `et cubuit 
cum patre suo' significat quod sic adaptarentur: `et non cognovit in cubare ejus et in surgere ejus' significat quod bonum tale commune non sciverit aliter quam quod ita esset: `et fuit a crastino' 
significat postea: `et dixit primogenita ad minorem' significat quod affectio talis boni persuaderet falsum: `ecce cubui heri cum patre meo' significat quod ita conjuncta essent: `propinemus ei vinum 
etiam nocte hac' significat, hic ut prius, quod imbuerent tale bonum falsis cum singula essent in tanto obscuro: `et veni, cuba cum eo' significat quod haec quoque conjungerentur: [4] `et vivificemus 
de patre nostro semen' significat, hic ut prius, quod sic novum cujusdam Ecclesiae: `et propinaverunt etiam in nocte illa patri eorum vinum' significat quod obscuro illo statu imbuerint tale bonum 
falsis: `et surrexit minor cubuit cum eo' significat quod affectio falsi similiter fecerit ut falsa sicut vera apparerent, et sic conjungebantur: `et non cognovit: cubare ejus et in surgere ejus' significat 
[hic ut prius], quod bonum tale commune non sciverit aliter quam quod ita esset: `et conceperunt binae filiae Loti a patre suo' significat quod inde origo talis religio quod per `Moabum' et `filium 
Ammonis' significatur. </p>
