<h3 align="center" class="ired">属天的奥秘 第2859节</h3>
<h4 align="center"></h4><p><strong>2859.</strong>“亚伯拉罕就住在别是巴”表主就是那教义本身。这从“住”和前面所解释的“别是巴”的含义，“亚伯拉罕”的代表性，同时从刚才所述清楚可知。“住在别是巴”就是遵守教义，但当论及主时，这句话的意思是，主就是这教义；正如“住在天堂”也是论及主，不仅表示祂就在天堂，还表示祂自己就是天堂，因为祂是天堂的全部（<a href="551.htm">551</a>，<a href="552.htm">552</a>节）。众所周知，主就是圣言，故主就是教义（<a href="2533.htm">2533</a>节），因为一切教义来自圣言。在圣言中，教义的全部皆来自主，且关乎主。就圣言的内义而言，所论述的主题无非是主及其国度，这早已说过多次。圣言的内义主要论述了主的神性人，在圣言中凡涉及人的地方，教义的全部都是要敬拜祂、爱祂。</p>

And Abraham dwelt in Beersheba. That this signifies that the Lord is that doctrine itself, is evident from the signification of "dwelling;" from the representation of Abraham; from the signification 
of "Beersheba" (explained before); and at the same time from the things which just precede. To "dwell in Beersheba" is to be in doctrine, but when predicated of the Lord it is to be doctrine; just as 
to dwell in heaven, which is also said of the Lord, signifies not only that He is in heaven, but also that He Himself is heaven; for He is the all of heaven (n. 551, 552). That the Lord is the Word is 
known, and therefore the Lord is doctrine (n. 2531), for all doctrine is from the Word. The all of doctrine in the Word is from the Lord, and is concerning the Lord. In the internal sense of the Word 
nothing but the Lord and His kingdom is treated of, as has been shown many times. It is the Lord's Divine Human of which the internal sense of the Word especially treats; and the all of doctrine in the 
Word as regards man is to worship Him and love Him. </p>

'And Abraham dwelt in Beersheba' means that the Lord is that doctrine itself. This is clear from the meaning of 'dwelling', from the representation of 'Abraham', and from the meaning of 'Beersheba', 
all of which have been dealt with already, and is at the same time clear from what has gone immediately before. 'Dwelling in Beersheba' means abiding in doctrine, but when used in reference to the Lord 
the expression means His being such doctrine, even as 'dwelling in heaven', which also is said of the Lord, means not only that He is in heaven but also that He is heaven, for He is the All of heaven, <a href="551.htm">551</a>, <a href="552.htm">552</a>. It is well known that the Lord is the Word; so He is doctrine also, <a href="2533.htm">2533</a>, for all doctrine is drawn from the Word. The whole of the doctrine within the Word is received from the Lord and 
has to do with the Lord. In the internal sense of the Word nothing else than the Lord and His kingdom are the subject, as shown many times. It is the Lord's Divine Human that is the subject primarily 
of the internal sense of the Word. The whole of the doctrine within the Word, where man is concerned, has to do with worshipping Him and loving Him. </p>

Quod `habitavit Abraham in Beersheba' significet quod Dominus sit ipsa illa doctrina, constat ex significatione `habitare,' ex repraesentatione `Abrahami,' et ex significatione `Beersheba,' de quibus 
prius, et simul ex illis quae mox praecedunt; `habitare in Beersheba' est esse in doctrina, at cum praedicatur de Domino, est esse doctrina; sicut habitare in caelo, ut quoque dicitur de Domino, non 
solum significat quod sit in caelo, sed etiam quod Ipse sit caelum, est enim Omne caeli, n. 551, 552 quod Dominus sit Verbum, {1}notum est, ita Dominus est doctrina, n. 2533, nam omnis doctrina est ex 
Verbo; omne doctrinae in Verbo ex Domino est, et de Domino est; in sensu interno Verbi nihil nisi de Domino et de Ipsius regno agitur, ut pluries ostensum; est Divinum Humanum Domini, de quo sensus 
internus Verbi imprimis agit; et omne doctrinae in Verbo quoad hominem est Ipsum {2}colere et Ipsum amare. @1 i cuivis$ @2 A transposes colere and amare$ </p>
