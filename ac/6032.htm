<h3 align="center" class="ired">属天的奥秘 第6032节</h3>
<h4 align="center"></h4><p><strong>6032.</strong>“约瑟一看见他”表觉知。这从“看见”的含义清楚可知，“看见”是指理解并觉知（参看<a href="2150.htm">2150</a>，<a href="3764.htm">3764</a>，<a href="4567.htm">4567</a>，<a href="4723.htm">4723</a>，<a href="5400.htm">5400</a>节），也指有信（<a href="2325.htm">2325</a>，<a href="2807.htm">2807</a>，<a href="3863.htm">3863</a>，<a href="3869.htm">3869</a>，<a href="4403.htm">4403</a>，<a href="4421.htm">4421</a>，<a href="5400.htm">5400</a>节）。关于“看见”表示理解，因而觉知，以及有信，要知道，人有两样事物，或说两个组成部分构成他的生命，即属灵之光和属灵之热。属灵之光构成其理解力的生命，属灵之热构成其意愿的生命。属灵之光由于它自己的来源而为从主的神性良善流入的神性真理，因而是从仁之良善流入的信之真理；而属灵之热由于它自己的来源而为主的神性之爱的神性良善，因而是属天之爱，或对主之爱的良善，和属灵之爱或对邻之爱的良善。如前所述，这二者构成人的整个生命。<br />至于属灵之光，这光与人之理解力的关系，犹如属世之光与其外在视觉的关系。也就是说，为让眼睛能发挥功能，就是能看见，必须有光来光照；然后眼睛才能看见它周围的一切事物。理性心智，即人的内眼也是如此。为让这眼睛能发挥功能，就是能看见，必须有从主所流入的天堂之光来光照它；当这眼睛被此光光照时，它也会看见它周围的事物。不过，它所看见的物体是属灵的，就是记忆知识和真理。然而，当这光没有光照时，人的理性心智，或内眼，和外眼或肉眼一样陷入黑暗，什么也看不见；也就是说，从记忆知识看不见任何真理，从真理看不见任何良善。光照理性心智的光是真光，这种光比世上正午之光明亮一千倍，我能证实这一点，因为我见过它。天上的所有天使都凭这光看见他们周围的事物，同样凭这光看见并觉知信之真理及其品质。这解释了为何“看见”在灵义上不仅表示理解，还表示凡属理解的活动，如思考、反思、观察、谨慎，以及许多这类活动；同样不仅表示信，还表示凡构成信的事物，如真理，取自圣言的教义等等。<br />关于属灵之热，这热与人之意愿的关系，犹如属世之光与其肉体的关系，因为一个赋予另一个生命。但由于它的最初来源（这来源可追溯到主那里），属灵之热无非是对整个人类的神性之爱，以及人由此对主，以及对邻的回应之爱。这属灵之热是真热；它以温暖或热愉悦或祝福天使的身体，同时以爱愉悦或祝福他们的至内层。正因如此，在圣言中，“热”、“火焰”、“火”在正面意义上表示与爱有关的事物，如对良善与真理的情感，以及良善本身。</p>

And he was seen of him. That this signifies perception, is evident from the signification of "to see," as being to understand and to perceive (see n. 2150, 3764, 4567, 4723, 5400), and also to have faith 
(n. 2325, 2807, 3863, 3869, 4403, 4421, 5400). In regard to "seeing" as denoting to understand and thence to perceive and also to have faith, be it known that there are two things with man which 
make his life, namely, Spiritual Light and Spiritual Heat. Spiritual light makes the life of his understanding, and spiritual heat the life of his will. Spiritual light is from its first origin Divine 
truth from the Divine good of the Lord, and hence is the truth of faith from the good of charity. And spiritual heat is from its first origin the Divine good of the Divine love of the Lord, and hence 
is the good of celestial love, which is love to the Lord, and the good of spiritual love, which is love toward the neighbor. These two, as before said, constitute the whole life of man. [2] As regards 
spiritual light, it is with this in the understanding of man as it is with natural light in his external sight; namely, in order that the eye may see, it is necessary that there be light to illumine, 
and then the eye sees in the light all things which are round about outside of it. So the intellectual mind, which is man's internal eye-in order that this eye may see, it is necessary for the light 
of heaven, which is from the Lord, to illumine it; and when this eye is illumined by this light, it then sees the things which are round about outside of itself; but the objects which it sees are spiritual, 
namely, memory-knowledges and truths. But when this light does not illumine, the intellectual mind or internal eye of man, like the external or bodily eye, is in darkness and sees nothing, that 
is, from memory-knowledges nothing of truth, and from truths nothing of good. The light which illumines the intellectual mind is in very truth light, and such light that it a thousand times surpasses 
the midday light of the world, which I bear witness to because I have seen it. By this light all the angels in the heavens see the things which are round about outside of themselves, and also by the 
same light they see and perceive the truths which are of faith, and their quality. Hence then it is that by "seeing" is signified in the spiritual sense not only the understanding, but also whatever 
is of the understanding, as thought, reflection, observation, prudence, and many such things; likewise not only faith, but also whatever is of faith, as truth, doctrine from the Word, and the like. [3] 
But as regards spiritual heat, it is with this in the will of man as it is with natural heat in the body, in that it vivifies. But in its first origin, which origin is from the Lord, spiritual heat 
is nothing else than the Divine love toward the universal human race, and from this the reciprocal love of man to Him and also toward the neighbor. And this spiritual heat is in very truth heat, which 
gladdens the bodies of the angels with heat, and at the same time their interiors with love. Hence it is that by "heat," "flame," and "fire" in the Word are signified in the genuine sense those things 
which are of love, as the affections of good and of truth, and also good itself. </p>

'And was seen towards him' means perception. This is clear from the meaning of 'seeing' as understanding and discerning, dealt with in <a href="2150.htm">2150</a>, <a href="3764.htm">3764</a>, <a href="4567.htm">4567</a>, <a href="4723.htm">4723</a>, <a href="5400.htm">5400</a>, and as having faith, <a href="1315.htm">1315</a>, <a href="1807.htm">1807</a>, <a href="3863.htm">3863</a>, <a href="3869.htm">3869</a>, <a href="4403.htm">4403</a>-<a href="4421.htm">4421</a>, <a href="5400.htm">5400</a>. As regards the meaning of 'seeing' as understanding and therefore perceiving, and also as having faith, it should be recognized that a person has two components constituting 
his life - SPIRITUAL LIGHT and SPIRITUAL HEAT. Spiritual light constitutes the life of his understanding, and spiritual heat the life of his will. By virtue of its very own origin spiritual light is 
Divine Truth flowing from the Lord's Divine Good and is therefore the truth of faith flowing from the good of charity, while spiritual heat by virtue of its very own origin is the Divine Good of the 
Lord's Divine Love and is therefore the good of celestial love or love to the Lord and the good of spiritual love or love towards the neighbour. As has been stated, these two constitute the entire life 
in a person. </p>
<p></p>
<p><b>[2]</b>
 As regards spiritual light, this is related to a person's understanding in the way that natural light is related to his external sight. That is to say, so that the eye can function, 
light must exist which enables it to do so. When it exists the eye beholds in that light everything all round outside itself. The same is true of the intellectual power of the mind, which is a person's 
inner eye. So that this eye can function the light of heaven flowing from the Lord must exist, enabling it to do so. And when this eye functions with the aid of that light it too beholds things 
all round outside itself. But the objects it sees are spiritual ones - facts and truths. When however it does not have the aid of that light, a person's intellectual power of the mind or inner eye is 
like his external or physical eye when this is in darkness and cannot see anything. That is, it does not from factual knowledge behold any truth, or from truth behold any good. The light which enables 
the intellectual power of the mind to function is light indeed, a kind of light which is a thousand times brighter than midday light in the world, as I can testify since I have beheld it. In that light 
all the angels in heaven see things all round outside themselves, and in that same light they also behold and perceive the truths of faith and the essential nature of them. This now explains why in 
the spiritual sense 'seeing' means not only the understanding but also any of its activities, such as cogitation, reflection, observation, circumspection, and many others, as well as meaning not only 
faith but also anything constituting faith, such as truth, teaching drawn from the Word, and the like.  </p>
<p></p>
<p><b>[3]</b>
 As regards spiritual heat however, this is related to a person's will in the way natural 
heat is related to his body, in that the one imparts life to the other. But by virtue of its very origin - an origin that can be traced back to the Lord - spiritual heat is nothing other than Divine 
Love towards the entire human race and the reciprocation of that love by man, to Him and also towards the neighbour. And that heat is heat indeed; it blesses angels' bodies with warmth and at the same 
time blesses their inmost beings with love. This is the reason why 'heat', 'flame', and 'fire', when used in the genuine sense in the Word, mean things connected with love, such as affections for goodness 
and truth, and also goodness itself. </p>

`Et visus ad illum':  quod significet perceptionem, constat a significatione `videre' quod sit intelligere et appercipere, de qua n.2150, 3764, 4567, 4723, 5400; et quod sit fidem habere, {1}n. 2325, 
2807, 3863, 3869, 4403-4421, 5400.  Quod `videre' sit intelligere et inde percipere, tum {2} quod sit fidem habere, sciendum quod apud hominem sint duo quae faciunt ejus vitam, nempe LUX SPIRITUALIS 
et CALOR SPIRITUALIS; lux spiritualis facit vitam ejus intellectus, et calor spiritualis vitam ejus voluntatis; lux spiritualis est a sua prima origine Divinum Verum ex Divino Bono Domini, et inde verum 
fidei ex bono charitatis; et calor spiritualis a sua prima origine {3}est Divinum Bonum Divini Amoris Domini, et inde bonum amoris caelestis qui est in Dominum, et bonum amoris spiritualis qui est 
erga proximum; haec bina, ut dictum, constituunt omnem vitam hominis.  [2]Quod lucem spiritualem attinet, illa in intellectu hominis se habet sicut lux naturalis in ejus visu externo; nempe, ut oculus 
videat, necessum est ut lux sit quae illuminet, et tunc oculus in luce videt omnia quae circumcirca extra illum sunt; ita mens intellectualis, quae est oculus hominis internus; ut ille oculus videat, 
necessum est ut lux caeli quae a Domino, illuminet, et cum oculus ille illuminatus est ab illa luce, tunc videt illa quae circumcirca extra illum sunt; {4}sed objecta quae videt, sunt spiritualia, nempe 
scientifica et vera; cum autem lux haec non illuminat, est mens intellectualis seu oculus internus hominis, sicut oculus externus seu corporis, in tenebris et nihil videt, hoc est, ex scientificis 
nihil veri, et ex veris nihil boni; lux quae illuminat mentem intellectualem, est revera lux, et talis lux quae millies excedit lucem, mundi meridianam, (m)quod testor quia vidi;(n) ex illa luce vident 
omnes angeli in caelis illa quae circumcirca extra se sunt, et quoque ex eadem luce vident et percipiunt {5}vera quae fidei, et quale illorum; inde nunc est quod per `videre' significetur in sensu 
spirituali non modo {6} intellectus, sed etiam quicquid {7} intellectus est, {8}ut cogitatio, {9} reflexio, animadvertentia, prudentia, et plura talia, tum non modo fides sed etiam quicquid fidei est, 
ut verum, doctrinale ex Verbo, et similia.  [3]Quod autem calorem spiritualem attinet, se habet ille in voluntate hominis sicut calor naturalis in corpore, quod vivificet; sed est calor spiritualis 
non aliud in sua prima origine, quae origo est a Domino, quam {10}Divinus Amor erga universum genus humanum, et inde reciprocus hominis in Ipsum, ut et erga proximum; et est calor ille spiritualis revera 
calor, qui corpora angelorum calore, et simul interiora illorum amore, beat; inde est quod per calorem, flammam, ignem in Verbo in genuino sensu significentur illa quae amoris sunt, sicut affectiones
