<h3 align="center" class="ired">属天的奥秘 第6324节</h3>
<h4 align="center"></h4><p><strong>6324.</strong>在来世花大量时间进行推理的灵人很少觉知何为真理与良善，因此，他们不能被接纳到更内在的天使社群；因为在那里，聪明根本无法被赋予他们。这些灵人还彼此推理一切思维和情感的流注，声称，如果这种观念是真的，那么任何人都不能被判有罪，或为任何过犯付出代价，受到惩罚。可他们得到的答复是，一个人若真的照事情的真相去相信，也就是说，相信一切良善与真理皆来自主，一切邪恶与虚假皆来自地狱，就不可能因任何过犯而被判有罪，也不可能将邪恶归咎于他自己。但是，他相信邪恶始于他自己，故将邪恶归于他自己；因为他的信仰促使这一切发生。邪恶就这样粘附在他身上，无法与他分离。事实上，这个人具有这样的性质：如果有人告诉他说，他的思维和意愿来自其他人，而非始于他自己，他就会恼怒。</p>

<p align="center"><b>Potts(1905-1910) 6324</b></p><p><b>6324.</b>
Spirits who reason much in the other life have little perception of what is true and good, and therefore they cannot be admitted into interior angelic societies; for nothing of intelligence can be communicated 
to them there. These spirits also have reasoned among themselves about the influx of all thoughts and affections, and said, "If this be so, no one can become guilty and suffer the penalty of 
any fault." But they received for answer that if a man would believe as the case really is, namely, that all that is good and true is from the Lord, and all that is evil and false is from hell, he then 
could not become guilty of any fault, nor could evil be imputed to him; but because he believes that it is from himself, he appropriates evil to himself, for this is the effect of his faith; and in 
this way evil adheres and cannot be separated from him; nay, such is man that he would be indignant if anyone should say that he thinks and wills from others, and not from himself. </p>

Spirits who spend much of their time reasoning in the next life have little perception as to what is true or good and therefore cannot be admitted into the more internal angelic communities, for no intelligence 
at all can be imparted to them there. They have also been given to reasoning among themselves about the idea that every thought or affection anyone has flows into him, saying that if this 
idea were true, then no one could be found guilty or pay the price for any offence. But they were told in reply that if a person were to believe as things really are, which is that everything good and 
true comes from the Lord and everything evil and false from hell, he could not have been found guilty of any offence or had evil ascribed to himself. But because he believes that it begins in himself 
he takes evil as his own; for his belief causes this to happen. Thus evil clings and cannot be separated from him. Indeed the person's nature is such that he would be indignant if anyone told him that 
his thoughts and desires came from others and did not begin in himself. </p>

</p><b>6324.</b>
Spiritus qui multum ratiocinantur in altera vita, parum percipiunt quid verum et bonum, quare nec in societates interiores angelicas admitti (x)queunt, nam illis ibi non communicari potest aliquid intelligentiae; 
illi quoque inter se ratiocinati sunt de influxu omnium cogitationum et affectionum, et dicebant, si ita, nullus posset reus fieri, et luere poenam alicujus delicti; at respondebatur illis, 
si homo crederet sicut (t)se res habet, quod nempe omne bonum et verum sit a Domino, et omne malum et falsum ab inferno, quod tunc non potuisset reus fieri alicujus delicti, et ei imputari malum; 
sed quia credit quod a se, appropriat sibi malum, nam fides hoc facit; ita malum inhaeret, nec ab illo separari potest; immo talis est homo quod indignaturus sit, si quis diceret illum cogitare et velle 
ex aliis, non a se. </p>
