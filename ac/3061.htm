<h3 align="center" class="ired">属天的奥秘 第3061节</h3>
<h4 align="center"></h4><p><strong>3061.</strong>“耶和华我主人亚伯拉罕的神”表神性本身，也就是父，与神性人，也就是子的（交流）。这从前面频繁的阐述和说明清楚可知，即：“耶和华神”是主的神性本身，也就是所谓的“父”；而亚伯拉罕代表祂的神性人（<a href="2833.htm">2833</a>，<a href="2836.htm">2836</a>节）。在旧约，“耶和华”就是主自己（<a href="1736.htm">1736</a>，<a href="1815.htm">1815</a>，<a href="2921.htm">2921</a>节）。大洪水前的上古教会和大洪水后的古教会都将“耶和华”唯独视为主（<a href="1343.htm">1343</a>，<a href="1676.htm">1676</a>，<a href="1990.htm">1990</a>，<a href="2016.htm">2016</a>，<a href="3035.htm">3035</a>节）。神性本身、神性人和神性的神圣发出这三位一体存在于主里面，这些为一（<a href="1999.htm">1999</a>，<a href="2149.htm">2149</a>，<a href="2156.htm">2156</a>，<a href="2288.htm">2288</a>，<a href="2329.htm">2329</a>，<a href="2447.htm">2447</a>节）。主里面的整个三位一体就是耶和华（<a href="2156.htm">2156</a>，<a href="2329.htm">2329</a>节）；主里面的每一个事物都是耶和华（<a href="1902.htm">1902</a>，<a href="1921.htm">1921</a>节）。主与父为一，在天上，父并没有其它理解（<a href="14.htm">14</a>，<a href="15.htm">15</a>，<a href="1725.htm">1725</a>，<a href="1729.htm">1729</a>，<a href="1733.htm">1733</a>，<a href="1815.htm">1815</a>，<a href="2005.htm">2005</a>，<a href="2018.htm">2018</a>，<a href="2025.htm">2025</a>，<a href="2803.htm">2803</a>，<a href="3038.htm">3038</a>节）。主构成整个天堂，因为祂是那里的全部；纯真、平安、爱、仁、怜悯和婚姻之爱的一切皆来自祂，如同一切善与真皆来自祂。摩西和众先知，因而圣言，每个细节都涉及祂；教会的一切宗教仪式都代表祂（<a href="2751.htm">2751</a>节）。就神性人而言，主被称作“子”（<a href="2628.htm">2628</a>节）。主的神性人不仅从祂的神性本质，也就是耶和华成孕，还由此生出（<a href="2798.htm">2798</a>节）。就人性而言，主由此变成耶和华和祂自己的生命（<a href="1603.htm">1603</a>，<a href="1737.htm">1737</a>节）。<br />主自永恒就存在，这从圣言明显可知（参看<a href="2803.htm">2803</a>节），尽管后来祂在某个时间节点上出生。祂通过摩西和众先知说话，同样向很多人显现。他们的着述都提到说，祂就是耶和华。但这极深的奥秘除了那些拥有神性直觉的人外，无法被揭示给任何人，因而除了属天且拥有这种直觉的上古教会成员外，几乎无法被揭示给任何人。我从这些人听说，每当耶和华自己降至天堂，或经由天堂流入时，祂就是主的神性人。因为天堂就其一切部位而言，类似一个人，并因此被称作大人（<a href="684.htm">684</a>，<a href="1276.htm">1276</a>，<a href="2996.htm">2996</a>，<a href="2998.htm">2998</a>，<a href="3021.htm">3021</a>节）。在天堂，即这个大人里面，神性本身就是神性人，是以那种方式披上人性的耶和华自己。<br />但当人类已变得如此，致使披戴神性人的神性本身无法再对它产生影响时，也就是说，当耶和华因人类离得太远而无法再以那种方式抵达人类那里时，耶和华，也就是主的神性本质，就降下来，通过从神性成孕，像其他人那样从童女出生而给自己披上一个人身。不过，祂把从童女所接受的一切都逐出了，并通过神性方式将已出生的这个人身变成神性。从变成神性的这个人身发出神圣的一切。神性人本身就这样变成一种本质，这种本质充满整个天堂，并使那些以前无法得救的人得救。这就是主，就神性人而言，唯独祂是人，每个人都通过祂而成为真正的人（<a href="49.htm">49</a>，<a href="288.htm">288</a>，<a href="477.htm">477</a>，<a href="565.htm">565</a>，<a href="1894.htm">1894</a>节）。</p>

Jehovah God of my lord Abraham. That this signifies of the Divine Itself which is the Father, with the Divine Human which is the Son (that is, communication), is evident from what has been so often said 
and shown above, namely, that "Jehovah God" is the Divine Itself of the Lord, which is called the "Father;" and that by Abraham is represented His Divine Human (n. 2833, 2836). It may be seen above, 
that in the Word of the Old Testament "Jehovah" is the Lord Himself (n. 1736, 1815, 2921); and that the Most Ancient Church before the flood and the Ancient Church after the flood understood by "Jehovah" 
no other than the Lord (n. 1343, 1676, 1990, 2016, 3035). Also that in the Lord is the Trinity-the Divine Itself, the Divine Human, and the proceeding Divine Holy-and these are a one (n. 1999, 
2149, 2156, 2288, 2329, 2447). That all the Trinity in the Lord is Jehovah (n. 2156, 2329); and that each and all things in the Lord are Jehovah (n. 1902, 1921). That the Lord is one with the Father, 
and that no other is understood in heaven by the Father (n. 14, 15, 1725, 1729, 1733, 1815, 2005, 2018, 2025, 2803, 3038). That the Lord is the universal heaven, for He is the all there; and that from 
Him is the all of innocence, of peace, of love, of charity, of mercy, of conjugial love; and all good and truth. That Moses and the Prophets, thus the Word in every particular, is concerning Him; and 
that all the rites of the church represented Him (n. 2751). That the Lord as to the Divine Human is called the "Son" (n. 2628). That the Divine Human of the Lord was not only conceived, but was also 
born of His Divine Essence, which is Jehovah (n. 2798); and that thereby the Lord as to the Human was made Jehovah, and Life of Himself (n. 1603, 1737). [2] That the Lord was from eternity, is plainly 
evident from the Word (see n. 2803), although He was afterwards born in time; for He spoke by Moses and the Prophets; He likewise had appeared to many, and it is there said that He was Jehovah. But 
this deepest of arcana could be revealed to none but those who are in Divine perception, thus to scarcely any but the men of the Most Ancient Church, who were celestial and in this perception. From these 
I have heard that Jehovah Himself was the Lord as to the Divine Human when He descended into heaven and flowed in through heaven; for heaven represents one man as to all his members, and is therefore 
also called the Grand Man (n. 684, 1276, 2996, 2998, 3021). The Divine Itself in heaven, that is, in the Grand Man, was the Divine Human, and was Jehovah Himself thus clothed with the Human.  [3] 
But when mankind became such that the Divine Itself, clothed as the Divine Human, could no longer affect them (that is, when Jehovah could no longer come to man, because man had so far removed himself), 
then Jehovah, who is the Lord as to the Divine Essence, descended and took upon Himself a Human, by conception Divine, and by birth from a virgin such as is that of another man; but this He expelled, 
and by Divine means made Divine the Human that was born, from which proceeds all the Holy. Thus the Divine Human became an essence by itself which fills the universal heaven, and which also makes 
it possible for those to be saved who could not be saved before. This then is the Lord, who as to the Divine Human is alone Man, and from whom man has it that he is man (n. 49, 288, 477, 565, 1894). </p>

'O Jehovah, the God of my master Abraham' means of the Divine itself, which is the Father, with the Divine Human, which is the </p>
<p>Son, that is to say, communication of these. This is clear from what 
has been stated and shown several times above, namely the following: </p>
<p> 'Jehovah God' is the Lord's Divine itself, which is called the Father, while 'Abraham' represents His Divine Human, <a href="2833.htm">2833</a>, <a href="2836.htm">2836</a>. Jehovah 
in the Old Testament Word is the Lord Himself, see <a href="1736.htm">1736</a>, <a href="1815.htm">1815</a>, <a href="2921.htm">2921</a>. The Most Ancient Church before the Flood, and the Ancient Church after the Flood, meant by 'Jehovah' none other than the 
Lord, <a href="1343.htm">1343</a>, <a href="1676.htm">1676</a>, <a href="1990.htm">1990</a>, <a href="2016.htm">2016</a>, <a href="3035.htm">3035</a>.  Within the Lord exists the Trinity of the Divine itself, the Divine Human, and the Divine Holy proceeding, and these are one, <a href="1999.htm">1999</a>, <a href="2149.htm">2149</a>, <a href="2156.htm">2156</a>, <a href="2288.htm">2288</a>, <a href="2329.htm">2329</a>, <a href="2447.htm">2447</a>. 
 The entire Trinity within the Lord is Jehovah, <a href="2156.htm">2156</a>, <a href="2329.htm">2329</a>; and every single thing in the Lord is Jehovah, <a href="1902.htm">1902</a>, <a href="1921.htm">1921</a>. The Lord is one with the Father, and no other is meant in heaven by the Father, <a href="14.htm">14</a>, <a href="15.htm">15</a>, <a href="1725.htm">1725</a>, <a href="1729.htm">1729</a>, <a href="1733.htm">1733</a>, <a href="1815.htm">1815</a>, <a href="2005.htm">2005</a>, <a href="2018.htm">2018</a>, <a href="2025.htm">2025</a>, <a href="2803.htm">2803</a>, <a href="3038.htm">3038</a>. The Lord constitutes the whole of heaven since He is its All; from Him comes the whole of innocence, peace, love, charity, mercy, and conjugial 
love, as do all Good and Truth, Moses and the Prophets, and so the Word in every detail, have reference to Him; and all the religious observances of the Church were representative of Him, <a href="2751.htm">2751</a>. As 
to the Divine Human the Lord is called the Son, <a href="2628.htm">2628</a>. The Lord's Divine Human was not only conceived but also born from His Divine Essence, which is Jehovah, <a href="2798.htm">2798</a>. Thus as to the Human the Lord 
became Jehovah, and Life from Himself, <a href="1603.htm">1603</a>, <a href="1737.htm">1737</a> </p>
<p></p>
<p><b>[2]</b>
 The Lord has existed from eternity, as is quite clear from the Word, see <a href="2803.htm">2803</a>, even though He was born at a particular point in time. For He 
it was who spoke through Moses and the Prophets (having also appeared to many) in whose writings it is said that He was Jehovah. But this very deep arcanum cannot be revealed to anyone except to those 
who possess Divine perception, and so to scarcely any apart from members of the Most Ancient Church, who were celestial and possessed such perception. From these people I have heard that Jehovah Himself 
was the Lord as regards the Divine Human whenever He came down into heaven or flowed in by way of heaven, for heaven resembles one human being as to all its members, and for that reason is also called 
the Grand Man, <a href="684.htm">684</a>, <a href="1276.htm">1276</a>, <a href="2996.htm">2996</a>, <a href="2998.htm">2998</a>, <a href="3021.htm">3021</a>. The Divine itself within heaven or the Grand Man was the Divine Human, and was Jehovah Himself clothed in that manner with the Human.  </p>
<p></p>
<p><b>[3]</b>
 But when 
the human race had become such that the Divine itself clothed as the Divine Human could no longer exert any influence on it, that is, when Jehovah could no longer reach down to mankind in that way because 
it had moved so far away, Jehovah, who is the Lord as regards the Divine Essence, came down and took upon Himself the Human, which was by conception Divine, but by birth from the virgin was like 
that of any other human being. But what He received from the virgin He cast out, and by Divine means made Divine the Human that had been born. From this Human made Divine proceeds all that is holy. Thus 
the Divine Human has come into being as an Essence by itself which fills the whole of heaven and causes those to be saved who previously could not be saved. This now is the Lord, who alone as to the 
Divine Human is Man, and from whom everyone has it to be [truly] human, <a href="49.htm">49</a>, <a href="288.htm">288</a>, <a href="477.htm">477</a>, <a href="565.htm">565</a>, <a href="1894.htm">1894</a>. </p>

hoc non alicui potest revelatum esse, quam illis qui in perceptione Divina sunt, ita vix aliis quam homini Ecclesiae Antiquissimae, qui fuit caelestis, et in illa perceptione; ab illis audivi quod

ut Divinum Humanum, non amplius illud adicere posset, hoc est, cum Jehovah non [sic] amplius venire ad hominem, quia tantum se removit, tunc Jehovah, Qui est Dominus quoad (t)Divinam Essentiam, descendit, 
et suscepit Humanum, per conceptionem Divinum, et per nativitatem a virgine quale alius hominis; sed hoc expulit, et per Divina media humanum natum fecit Divinum, ex Quo omne Sanctum procedit; 
ita Divinum Humanum exstitit Essentia per se, quae implet universum caelum, ac facit ut salventur qui prius non salvari potuerunt; Hic nunc est Dominus, Qui quoad Divinum Humanum Solus est Homo, et
