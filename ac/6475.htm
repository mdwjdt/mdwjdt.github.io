<h3 align="center" class="ired">属天的奥秘 第6475节</h3>
<h4 align="center"></h4><p><strong>6475.</strong>我听见告诉一些恶灵的话，他们在灵人界，总是思想反对主（关于从地狱来的灵人在灵人界时是什么样，可参看<a href="5852.htm">5852</a>节）。他们被告知，他们可以出示某个人诚实地谈论天堂里的任何天使，或他们若能，在天堂指出哪一个人不承认主，不承认祂是所有人的生命，所有人都获得他们从主所拥有的东西。但这些恶灵都沉默了，因为他们做不到。其中一些恶灵认为也有不承认主的天堂存在，于是他们四处寻找、打听，可一番尝试之后，他们无功而返。<br />这些灵人还被告知，在地狱，所有人的思维都是反对主的思维，他们不将任何超人之物归于主，尽管他们大多数人声称他们承认一位至高的存在；他们所说的至高存在是指父。然而，他们却过着仇恨和报复的生活，想不断高举自己在他人之上，被拜为神明；他们以这种方式为自己打造了一个地狱。那些承认主，从心里相信祂的人就截然不同了。由此也清楚可知，主流入所有人，既以一种总体方式经由天堂流入，也以一种具体或特定方式，以及一种普遍方式直接从祂自己流入。同样清楚可知，仁之良善在哪里，主就在哪里；而且，对立面在哪里，祂也在哪里，不过只以允许祂赋予他们生命，尽可能地使他们远离邪恶的方式在那里。</p>

I have heard it said to certain evil spirits, who were in the world of spirits and who were continually thinking against the Lord (in regard to the spirits who are from hell, when in the world of spirits, 
see n. 5852), that they should produce someone who said with truth about any angel of heaven (or, if they could, should show one single person in heaven) who does not acknowledge the Lord, and that 
He is the life of all, and that all have what they have from Him; but they were silent, because they could not do it. Some of the evil spirits, who believed that there are heavens where the Lord is 
not acknowledged, wandered about and made inquiry, but after trying in vain, they returned. It was said to them further that all in hell think against the Lord, nor do they attribute anything to Him 
which is above what is human; and yet most say that they acknowledge a Supreme Being, by which they mean the Father, and nevertheless live in hatred and revenge, and continually desire to be exalted 
over others, and to be worshiped as gods, and in this way they make hell for themselves. It is very different with those who acknowledge the Lord, and believe in Him from the heart. From this also it 
is evident that the Lord flows into all, both generally through heaven, and singularly and also universally from Himself; and that where the good of charity is, there He is; and also where the contrary 
is, there also He is, but in no other way than to give them life, and to withdraw them from evil insofar as this can be done. </p>

I once heard what was told to certain evil spirits who were in the world of spirits and whose thoughts were constantly ones of opposition to the Lord. (What spirits from hell are like when they are in 
the world of spirits, see <a href="5852.htm">5852</a>). They were told to produce someone speaking truthfully about any angel in heaven - or if they could, to point out anyone in heaven - who did not acknowledge the Lord, 
anyone who did not acknowledge that He was the life in all people and that they derived all they possessed from Him. But those evil spirits remained silent because they could not do it. Some of them 
who believed that heavens also existed in which the Lord was not acknowledged went around in search of such; but they came back, having failed in the attempt. </p>
<p></p>
<p><b>[2]</b>
 Those spirits were told in addition 
that the thoughts of all in hell are ones of opposition to the Lord, and that those in hell attribute nothing superhuman whatever to Him, even though most of them say they acknowledge the Supreme Being, 
by whom they mean the Father. But they nevertheless lead lives of hatred and revenge, and wish to exalt themselves constantly above others and be venerated as gods; and in this way they make a hell 
for themselves. It is altogether different with those who acknowledge the Lord and at heart believe in Him. From this it is also clear that the Lord flows into all, both in a general manner by means 
of heaven and also in specific ways, as well as in a universal manner, directly from Himself. It is also clear that where the good of charity exists, He is present; and He is also present where the 
opposite exists, but only in a way that allows Him to give them life, and as far as possible to lead them away from evil. </p>

Audivi dictum ad quosdam spiritus malos qui in mundo spirituum erant, et qui continue contra Dominum cogitabant, (quales sunt spiritus qui ab inferno, cum in mundo spirituum, videatur n. 5852) ut {1}producerent 
aliquem ex veritate dicentem de aliquo angelo caeli aut, si possent, ostenderent unum in caelo qui non agnoscit Dominum et quod sit vita omnium, {2}quodque sua ab Ipso habeant; sed tacuerunt 
quia non potuerunt; quidam ex malis spiritibus qui crediderunt quod etiam caeli darentur ubi non agnosceretur Dominus circumvagati sunt, et inquisiverunt, sed irrito conatu redierunt.  [2] {3}Porro 
ad illos dictum quod omnes in inferno cogitent contra Dominum, nec Illi tribuant quicquam quod supra humanum; et tamen quod plerique {4}dicant se agnoscere Ens supremum, per quod intelligunt Patrem, 
et nihilominus in odiis et vindictis vivunt, et se continue efferre volunt super alios, et pro diis coli, ac ita infernum sibi faciunt.  Aliter prorsus (t)cum illis est qui Dominum agnoscunt et ex corde 
in Ipsum credunt.  Inde quoque constat quod Dominus influat in omnes, tam communiter per caelum quam singulariter ut et universaliter a Se; et quod ubi bonum charitatis est, ibi sit; at ubi contrarium 
ibi quoque sit sed non aliter quam ut det illis vitam, et quantum fieri potest, illos abducat a malo. @1 First wrote ostendant unum angelorum, and left undeleted$ @2 et quod sua omnia$ @3 Et porro$ @4 i eorum$ </p>
