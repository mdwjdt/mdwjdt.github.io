<h3 align="center" class="ired">属天的奥秘 第731节</h3>
<h4 align="center"></h4><p><strong>731.</strong>“把我所造的一切事物都从地面上除灭”表人的自我中心，可以说就是他在被赋予生命时要被除灭的。这句话还表示除灭那些毁灭自己的上古教会成员。这一点从有关自我中心的说明清楚可知。人的自我中心全然是恶与假。只要它继续存在，人就是死的。不过，当他经受试探时，它会被驱散，即被主的真理与良善所分解与调和。它以此被赋予生气，看似不复存在。“除灭”是指它表面不存在，并且不再造成进一步的伤害，尽管事实上，它决不会被除灭，而是依然存在。这和黑色与白色的情形极其相似。当被光线予以各种调和后，它们就转化为美丽的颜色，诸如蓝色、黄色和紫色，由此根据后者的特性和排列而呈现出可爱和宜人的色调，如花朵的情形。然而，它们根本上仍是黑色与白色。由于此处同时在阐述那些属上古教会之人最后的消磨，所以“把我所造的一切事物都从地面上除灭”（下面23节也是）亦表示那些灭亡之人。“我所造的一切事物”就是每一个事物，或拥有属天之种，即属于这个教会的每一个人。这也是为何本节和下面23节中用“土地”这个词的原因，土地表示良善与真理已被播种于其中的教会成员。那些被称为挪亚之人的恶与假被驱散后，如前所述，这种子就在他们身上逐渐生长。但在灭亡的大洪水之前的人当中，这种子被稗子窒息了。</p>

<p><strong>[NCE]731.</strong> Obliterating all substance that I have made from the face of the ground means that human self-sufficiency is obliterated, so to speak, when a person comes to life. This can be seen from earlier statements about selfhood [<a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_731/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_154" target=_top>154-155</a>, <a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_731/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_164" target=_top>164</a>]. Our insistence on autonomy is thoroughly evil and false. As long as it maintains its grip, we are dead. However, when we suffer times of trouble, this sense of autonomy is shaken off; that is, it is loosened and mitigated by the truth and goodness we receive from the Lord. In the process, it is brought to life and yet seems to disappear. The fact that it becomes invisible and harmless is symbolized by being obliterated even though it is never obliterated but remains.<br />The situation is almost like that with black and white. When these two are modified in various ways by rays of light, they turn into beautiful colors, such as blues, yellows, and reds. Through these colors, and depending on the objects they appear in (flowers, for instance), they display themselves as lovely and appealing. Still, they remain inherently and fundamentally black and white.<br />But since the present verse deals at the same time with the final devastation of the people in the earliest church, obliterating all substance that I have made from the face of the ground also symbolizes those who perished. So does verse <a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_731/bible_king-james-version_genesis_7_23" target=_top>23</a> below [<a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_731/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_807" target=_top>807-811</a>].<br />The substance that I have made is every trait (or every person) that had a germ of heaven in it (or who was part of the church). As a result, the current verse and verse <a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_731/bible_king-james-version_genesis_7_23" target=_top>23</a> below use the word ground, symbolizing a person in the church in whom the seed of goodness and truth has been sown. Once evil and falsity had been dispelled, as noted, that seed grew and grew in the people referred to as Noah, although among the pre-Flood people who died it was killed off by tares.{*1} <br /><strong>Footnotes:</strong><br />{*1} On the dispelling of evil mentioned here, see <a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_731/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_719" target=_top>719</a>.

Every substance that I have made will I destroy from off the faces of the ground. That this signifies man's Own, which is as if destroyed when vivified, is evident from what has been said before respecting 
this Own. Man's Own is all evil and falsity. So long as this continues, the man is dead; but when he comes into temptations it is dispersed, that is, loosened and tempered by truths and goods from 
the Lord, and thus is vivified and appears as if it were not present. That it does not appear and is no longer hurtful, is signified by "destroyed;" and yet it is not destroyed, but remains. It is 
almost as with black and white, which when variously modified by the rays of light are turned into beautiful colors-such as blue, yellow, and purple-whereby, according to their arrangement are presented 
lovely and agreeable tints, as in flowers, yet remaining radically and fundamentally black and white. But as here at the same time the final vastation of those who were of the Most Ancient Church 
is treated of, by "I will destroy every existing thing that I have made, from off the face of the ground" are signified those who perished (as likewise in the following verse, 23). The "substance that 
I have made" is all that, or every man, in which there was heavenly seed, or who was of the church; and therefore, both here and in the following verse, "ground" is mentioned, which signifies the man 
of the church in whom good and truth have been implanted. This seed, in those called "Noah"-evils and falsities being dispersed, as before said-gradually grew up; but with the antediluvians who perished 
it was extinguished by tares. </p>

'Wiping out everything<A name="fntext1"></a><A href="#fn1"><sup>a</sup></a> I have made from over the face<A name="fntext2"></a><A href="#fn2"><sup>b</sup></a> of the ground' means man's proprium, which is so to speak wiped out when he is being given life. This is clear from what has been stated already 
about the proprium. The human proprium is altogether evil and false. So long as it remains, a person is dead, but when he undergoes temptations, it is dispersed, that is, broken down and moderated 
by truths and goods from the Lord. In this way it is made alive and seems to be no longer present. Its apparent absence and causing no further harm is meant by 'being wiped out', though in fact it is 
in no way wiped out but remains. It is very similar to the behaviour of black and white. When these are variously modified by rays of light, they are converted into beautiful colours, such as blue, golden, 
and purple hues. By means of the latter, according to individual characteristics, as in the case of flowers, what is beautiful and pleasing is presented, although radically and fundamentally it 
is still the colours black and white. Now because the subject here is at the same time the final vastation of those who belonged to the Most Ancient Church, those who perished are meant as well by 'wiping 
out everything' I have made from over the face<A name="fntext2"></a><A href="#fn2"><sup>b</sup></a> of the ground.<A name="fntext1"></a><A href="#fn1"><sup>a</sup></a> This is also the case with verse 23 below. 'Everything I have made' is every thing, or every person who has celestial seed within 
him, that is, who belonged to the Church. This also is why in this verse, and in verse 23 below, the expression used is 'the ground', which means the member of the Church who has good and truth sown in 
him. And this grew more and more with those called Noah after evils and falsities had been dispersed, as stated already. But among the people before the Flood who perished, that seed was choked by tares.

</p><b>731.</b>
Quod per 'delere omnem substantiam, quam feci, a super faciebus humi' significetur hominis proprium quod quasi deletur cum vivificatur, constat ex illis quae prius de proprio 'dicta sunt; hominis proprium 
est omne malum et falsum; quamdiu hoc manet, tamdiu homo est mortuus, sed cum tentationes subit, tunc discutitur, hoc est, resolvitur et temperatur per vera et bona a Domino, et sic vivificatur 
et apparet sicut non adesset; quod non appareat, nec amplius noceat, significatur per 'deleri,' tametsi nusquam deletur, sed manet; se habet fere sicut nigrum et album, quae dum temperantur varie per 
lucis radios, vertuntur in colores pulchros, ut in caeruleos, flavos, purpureos, per quos, secundum dispositionem, ut in floribus, pulchra et jucunda sistuntur, manentibus usque radicitus et fundamentaliter 
nigro et albo. Sed quia hic simul agitur de ultima vastatione eorum qui fuerunt ab Ecclesia Antiquissima, etiam per 'delere omnem substantiam, quam feci, a super faciebus humi,' significantur 
ii qui perierunt, sicut quoque seq. vers. 23: 'substantia, quam feci' est omne id, seu omnis homo, in quo fuit semen caeleste, seu qui fuit ab Ecclesia, quare etiam in hoc versu, et in sequente 23, 'humus' 
diCitur, quae hominem Ecclesiae significat cui inseminatum bonum et verum, quod successive apud eos qui Noahus vocantur, discussis, sicut dictum, malis et falsis, succrevit; sed apud antediluvianos 
qui perierunt, per zizanias exstinctum est. </p>
