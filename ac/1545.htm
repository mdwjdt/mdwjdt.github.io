<h3 align="center" class="ired">属天的奥秘 第1545节</h3>
<h4 align="center"></h4><p><strong>1545.</strong>“他和他的妻子”表当时主所具有的属天真理。这从“他”，即“亚伯兰”的含义清楚可知。“亚伯兰”代表主，因而代表主里面的属天之物。人之所以为人是因着他里面的事物；主之所以为主是因着属天之物。唯独主是属天的，以至于是属天之物本身。所以，“亚伯兰”，尤其“亚伯拉罕”表示属天之物。这从“妻子”的含义进一步看出来，“妻子”是指与属天之物结合的真理，如前所述（<a href="1468.htm">1468</a>节）。它们是属天真理，或来自属天之物的真理，这从以下事实明显可知：经上先提及“他”，后提及“他妻子”。因为属天真理是一回事，系属天的真理是另一回事。属天真理起源于属天之物，而系属天的真理则起源于通过认知被植入在属天之物中的真理。</p><br />

<p><strong>[NCE]1545.</strong> The symbolism of he and his wife as heavenly truth that the Lord then possessed can be seen from the symbolism of him 钬?Abram 钬?as the Lord. And because Abram symbolizes the Lord, he also symbolizes something heavenly in the Lord. Our humanness comes from the qualities we possess. The Lord's humanity was the result of heavenly qualities, because he was the only heavenly person who ever lived. He was heavenliness itself. So "Abram" and more especially "Abraham"{*1} mean heavenly traits.<br />The symbolism is also visible from that of a wife as truth attached to a heavenly quality, shown above at 搂<a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_1545/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_1468" target=_top>1468</a>.<br />The fact that it was heavenly truth, or truth from heavenly origins, can be seen from the mention of him first and of his wife second. Heavenly truth differs from truth that is heavenly. Heavenly truth originates in a heavenly quality, but truth that is heavenly originates with truth and is grafted onto heavenly qualities through religious knowledge.{*2} <br /><strong>Footnotes:</strong><br />{*1} The original name of the biblical patriarch was Abram (讗址讘职专指诐 ['A岣噐腻m]), a name that probably means "exalted father." In <a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_1545/bible_king-james-version_genesis_17_5" target=_top>Genesis 17:5</a>, however, God changes Abram's name: "No longer will they call you by your name Abram, but your name will be Abraham, because I have made you father of an abundance of nations." There is a pun here (in the Genesis passage) on 讗植讘执专钬?钬斨缸?('a岣噄r h腻m): "chief of multitude" (see Brown, Driver, and Briggs 1996, page 4 right column, under 讗址讘职专指诐 ['A岣噐腻m], Strong's 87). In 搂<a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_1545/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_2010" target=_top>2010:1</a> Swedenborg explains that the change of name was necessary in order that the Lord or Jehovah could be represented: "The letter h was taken from Jehovah's name and inserted, and he was called Abraham. (The letter h is the only letter in Jehovah's name that involves divinity, and it means the I Am, or Being.)" He elsewhere notes that the Hebrew letter 讛 (h脓, or h) implies infinity "because it is simply a breathing" (<a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_1545/swedenborg_apocalypse-revealed-rogers_38" target=_top>Revelation Unveiled 38</a>; translated by George F. Dole). The renaming of Sarai (Abram's wife) as Sarah, like Abram's renaming as Abraham, means that the Lord was "shedding his human nature and putting on a divine nature" (<a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_1545/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_2009" target=_top>Secrets of Heaven 2009</a>, <a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_1545/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_2010" target=_top>2010</a>). Furthermore, the marriage of Abraham, standing for divine goodness, and Sarah, standing for divine truth, represents the divine marriage of goodness with truth in the Lord, "which would give birth to divine rationality, or Isaac" (<a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_1545/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_2063" target=_top>Secrets of Heaven 2063</a>). For more on the names Abram and Abraham, see also note 2 in 搂<a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_1545/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_64" target=_top>64</a>; for more on the meaning of letters in heavenly speech, see <a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_1545/swedenborg_apocalypse-revealed-rogers_29" target=_top>Revelation Unveiled 29</a>. [RS, KK]<br />{*2} Swedenborg evidently has a distinction in mind between the phrases here translated "heavenly truth" (Latin coeleste verum, literally, "heavenly true"), and "truth that is heavenly" (Latin verum coeleste, literally, "true heavenly"). His works now and then feature such reversals of paired adjectives, and sometimes they recur; but although each of the two expressions in question here comes up individually in many other passages, they do not appear together again as a reversed pair. Determining the nuance of meaning and the precise distinction at which he is driving is therefore difficult. It can be noted, however, that that which is heavenly is intuitive, living, and deep, and that which is merely true is comparatively rote, rigid, and shallow; see 搂搂<a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_1545/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_81" target=_top>81</a>, <a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_1545/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_200" target=_top>200-203</a>, <a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_1545/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_310" target=_top>310</a>, <a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_1545/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_393" target=_top>393</a>, <a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_1545/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_597" target=_top>597</a>, <a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_1545/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_1470" target=_top>1470</a>. In 搂<a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_1545/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_9466" target=_top>9466</a> Swedenborg describes "truth from a heavenly origin" (verum ex origine coelesti). Elsewhere he also distinguishes truth that leads to good from truth that arises out of good, which may be a different way of expressing the same distinction; see, for instance, 搂搂<a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_1545/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_3669" target=_top>3669</a>, <a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_1545/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_3688" target=_top>3688</a>, <a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_1545/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_6295" target=_top>6295-6296</a>, <a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_1545/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_7556" target=_top>7556</a>, <a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_1545/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_9550" target=_top>9550</a>.

He and he wife. That this signifies the celestial truths then in the Lord, may be seen from the signification of "he," that is, of Abram, as being the Lord, and consequently the celestial that was in 
Him. A man is a man from the things that are in him; the Lord, from the celestial things; for He alone was celestial, so as to be the celestial itself; on which account celestial things are signified 
by "Abram," and still more by "Abraham." This may be further seen from the signification of a "wife," as being truth adjoined to the celestial (as before shown, n. 1468). That the truths are celestial 
truths, or truths which are from celestial things, is evident from the fact that "he" is named first, and "his wife" afterwards. For celestial truth is one thing, and truth celestial is another; celestial 
truth is that which derives its origin from the celestial; truth celestial is that which is from the truth which is implanted in the celestial by means of knowledges [cognitiones]. </p>

<p align="center"><b>Elliott(1983-1999) 1545</b></p><p><b>1545.</b>
'He and his wife' means celestial truths which at that time resided with the Lord This becomes clear from the meaning of the pronoun 'he', which refers to Abram, as the Lord; and because it is the Lord, 
it is the celestial residing with Him, for a person is what he is by virtue of what resides with him. The Lord was the Lord from the celestial things that resided with Him, for He alone was so celestial 
as to be the celestial itself. Consequently 'Abram', and more so 'Abraham', means celestial things Next, the matter may become clear from the meaning of 'wife' as truth joined to the celestial, 
as shown already in <a href="1468.htm">1468</a>. That they are celestial truths, or truths deriving from celestial things, is clear from the consideration that he is mentioned first and his wife next, for celestial truth is 
one thing and celestial truth another. Celestial truth has its origin in the celestial, while celestial truth has its origin in truth implanted in the celestial by means of cognitions. </p>

</p><b>1545.</b>
'Ipse et uxor illius': quod significet caelestia vera quae tunc apud Dominum, constare potest a significatione ipsius, nempe 'Abrami' quod sit Dominus, et quia Dominus, est caeleste apud Ipsum; quod 
homo sit, hoc habet ab illis quae apud illam; Dominus a caelestibus, nam solus caelestis fuit, sic ut ipsum caeleste, quare per 'Abramum,' et magis per 'Abrahamum' significantur caelestia: dein constare 
potest a significatione 'uxoris' quod sit verum adjunctum caelesti, ut ostensum prius n. 1468: quod sint caelestia vera, seu vera quae a caelestibus, constat ex eo quod 'Ipse' primum nominetur, et 
'uxor illius' postea; aliud enim est caeleste verum et aliud verum caeleste; caeleste verum est quod originem ducit a caelesti, verum caeleste est quod a vero, quod implantatur caelesti per cognitiones. </p>
