<h3 align="center" class="ired">属天的奥秘 第6596节</h3>
<h4 align="center"></h4><p><strong>6596.</strong>“他被放在柜子里，停在埃及”表藏在教会的记忆知识里。这从“柜子”和“埃及”的含义清楚可知：“柜子”是指存放或隐藏某种事物的东西；“埃及”是指教会的记忆知识（参看<a href="4749.htm">4749</a>，<a href="4964.htm">4964</a>，<a href="4966.htm">4966</a>节）。教会的记忆知识是指那时对存在于古教会中的代表形式和有意义符号的认识或知识。上面这句话表示内在隐藏在这些认识或知识里面。关于教会内在的隐藏，以及通过这种隐藏而对它免受伤害的保护，可参看前文（<a href="6595.htm">6595</a>节）。“柜子”表示存放或隐藏某种事物的东西，这一点可从约柜看出来，它之所以被称为约柜，是因为它里面存放了法版或律法。</p>

<p align="center"><b>Potts(1905-1910) 6596</b></p><p><b>6596.</b>
And he was put in an ark in Egypt. That this signifies concealment in the memory-knowledges of the church, is evident from the signification of an "ark," as being that in which something is stored up 
or concealed; and from the signification of "Egypt," as being the memory-knowledges of the church (see n. 4749, 4964, 4966); and the memory-knowledges of the church were at that time the knowledges of 
the representatives and significatives that had been in the Ancient Church. The concealment of the internal in these is signified by the foregoing words. (Concerning the concealment of the internal 
of the church, and the consequent preservation lest it should suffer injury, see just above, n. 6595.) That an "ark" denotes that in which something is stored up or concealed, may be seen from the ark 
of the Testimony, in that it was called an "ark" because in it was stored up the Testimony or Law. </p>

<p align="center"><b>Elliott(1983-1999) 6596</b></p><p><b>6596.</b>
'And he was put in an ark in Egypt' means a concealment within the Church's factual knowledge. This is clear from the meaning of 'an ark' as that in which something is stored or concealed; and from the 
meaning of 'Egypt' as the Church's factual knowledge, dealt with in <a href="4749.htm">4749</a>, <a href="4964.htm">4964</a>, <a href="4966.htm">4966</a>. The Church's factual knowledge was at that time a cognizance of the representative forms and the meaningful signs 
that had existed in the Ancient Church, a concealment of the internal within that knowledge being meant by the words under consideration here. Regarding the concealment of the Church's internal and 
the preservation of it from harm by means of that concealment, see immediately above in <a href="6595.htm">6595</a>. The fact that 'an ark' is that in which something is stored or concealed may be recognized from the Ark of 
the Covenant, in that it was called an ark for the reason that it had the covenant or law stored in it. </p>

<p align="center"><b>Latin(1748-1756) 6596</b>
</p><b>6596.</b>
`Et ponebatur in arca in Aegypto':  quod significet occultationem in scientificis Ecclesiae, constat ex significatione `arcae' quod sit in quo aliquid reconditur seu occultatur; et ex significatione 
`Aegypti' quod sint scientifica Ecclesiae, de qua n. 4749, 4964, 4966; et scientifica Ecclesiae erant eo tempore cognitiones repraesentativorum et significativorum quae fuerunt in Antiqua Ecclesia; in 
his occultatio interni significatur per illa verba; de occultatione interni Ecclesiae, et inde praeservatione ne laedatur, videatur mox supra n. 6595.  Quod `arca' sit in quo aliquid reconditur seu 
occultatur, constare potest ex `Arca testimonii', quod illa ideo dicta sit arca, quia in illa recondebatur testimonium seu lex. </p>
