<h3 align="center" class="ired">属天的奥秘 第2041节</h3>
<h4 align="center"></h4><p><strong>2041.</strong>“你们都要割去肉体上的包皮”表除去我欲和物欲。这从“割去包皮”的代表物和含义，以及“肉体”的含义清楚可知：“割去包皮”是指从污秽的爱中洁净，如刚才所解释的（<a href="2039.htm">2039</a>节）；“肉体”则指人的自我，如前所述（<a href="999.htm">999</a>节）。人的自我无非由自我之爱和尘世之爱，以及源于这些爱的一切欲望构成。至于它们何等污秽，这在第一卷已予以说明（<a href="141.htm">141</a>，<a href="150.htm">150</a>，<a href="154.htm">154</a>，<a href="210.htm">210</a>，<a href="215.htm">215</a>，<a href="694.htm">694</a>，<a href="731.htm">731</a>，<a href="874.htm">874</a>-<a href="876.htm">876</a>，<a href="987.htm">987</a>，<a href="1047.htm">1047</a>节）。由于所表示的是要被除去的人的自我，故经上采用了“肉体上的包皮”这样的措辞。<br />有两种所谓的爱及其欲望会阻止主的天堂之爱流入。当这些爱居于内层人和外在人，并在那里占据时，它们要么排斥，要么窒息，并且还会败坏、玷污所流入的天堂之爱。因为它们与天堂之爱完全相反，蒙主怜悯，这一点容后说明。不过，这些爱越被除去，从主所流入的天堂之爱就越开始显现，事实上，开始在内层人中投入曙光；他也越开始发现自己处在恶与假中，然后发现他的确处在不洁和污秽中，最后则发现这是他的自我。这些爱正被除去的人就是那些正在重生的人。<br />当这些爱的欲望在未重生者里面沉寂下来时，这种除去也能在他们身上发现。如有时他们会沉思神性事物，或这些欲望变得萎靡不振，萎靡不振的情形发生在他们处于不幸、病痛和恶疾，尤其临终之时。在这种时候，肉体和世俗事物逐渐变得病弱不堪，仿佛死去。这种人会意识到天堂之光的某种事物，以及由此而来的安慰。不过，对这些人来说，那些欲望并未除去，只是萎靡不振。一旦回到先前的状态，他们会立刻陷入这些欲望中。<br />对恶者来说，肉体和世俗事物能变得安静。此时，他们仿佛被提升到某种天堂之物中，这种情形有时发生在来世的灵魂，尤其新来的灵魂身上。他们强烈渴望看见主的荣耀，因为他们在世时听了太多有关天堂的事了。在这种时候，上述外在事物就在他们里面安静下来，他们以这种方式被带入第一层天堂，享受他们所渴望的东西。但他们无法长时间留在那里，因为他们的肉体和世俗事物只是沉寂下来，并未除去，如他们与天使在一起时的情形（对此，参看<a href="541.htm">541</a>，<a href="542.htm">542</a>节）。要知道，天堂之爱不断从主流入人里面，除了那些爱的贪欲和源于它们的虚假外，没有其它东西能妨碍、阻止它，并且致使人不能接受它。</p>

Ye shall circumcise the flesh of your foreskin. That this signifies the removal of the love of self and of the world, is evident from the representation and signification of "circumcision," as being 
purification from filthy loves (explained above, n. 2039); and from the signification of "flesh," as being what is man's own (treated of before, n. 999). That which is man's own is nothing but the love 
of self and of the world, thus is all the derivative cupidity; and how filthy this is has been shown in Part First (n. 141, 150, 154, 210, 215, 694, 731, 874-876, 987, 1047). As this Own of man which 
is to be removed is signified, the expression "flesh of the foreskin" is made use of.  [2] There are two so-called loves and their cupidities that obstruct the influx of heavenly love from the Lord; 
for when these loves reign in the interior and in the external man, and take possession thereof, they either reject or suffocate, and also pervert and contaminate, the inflowing heavenly love; for they 
are utterly contrary to heavenly love, as will of the Lord's Divine mercy be shown hereafter. But insofar as these loves are removed, so far the heavenly love flowing in from the Lord begins to appear, 
nay, to give light in the interior man; and so far he begins to see that he is in evil and falsity; next that he is actually in uncleanness and filthiness; and finally that this has been his Own. 
They who are becoming regenerate are those with whom these loves are being removed.  [3] Observation of this removal is possible also with the unregenerate, for when the cupidities of these loves are 
quiescent in them, as sometimes occurs when they are in holy meditation, or when the cupidities are lulled, as happens when they are in misfortunes, in sicknesses, and diseases, and especially at the 
moment of death, then, because bodily and worldly things are lulled and as it were dead, they observe something of heavenly light and the consequent comfort. But with these persons there is not removal 
of the cupidities in question, but only a lulling of them, for when they return into their former state, they at once relapse into the same cupidities. [4] With the evil also, bodily and worldly 
things can be lulled, and they can then be as it were uplifted into a kind of heavenliness, as sometimes takes place with souls in the other life, especially those newly arrived, who intensely desire 
to see the glory of the Lord, because they had heard so much about heaven while they lived in the world. The external things above referred to are then lulled in them, and in this way they are carried 
into the first heaven and enjoy their desire. But they cannot remain long, because there is only a quiescence of the bodily and worldly things, and not a removal of them, as with the angels (concerning 
which, see n. 541, 542). Be it known that heavenly love is continually inflowing into man from the Lord, and that nothing else obstructs and impedes it, and causes its reception by the man impossible, 
except the cupidities of those loves and the falsities derived from them. </p>

'You shall circumcise the flesh of your foreskin' means the removal of self-love and love of the world. This is clear from the representation and the meaning of 'circumcision' as purification from filthy 
loves, dealt with just above in <a href="2039.htm">2039</a>, and also from the meaning of 'flesh' as man's proprium, dealt with already in <a href="999.htm">999</a>. Man's proprium consists of nothing but self-love and love of the world, and 
so of every desire that stems from those loves. Just how filthy it is has been shown in Volume One, in <a href="141.htm">141</a>, <a href="150.htm">150</a>, <a href="154.htm">154</a>, <a href="210.htm">210</a>, <a href="215.htm">215</a>, <a href="694.htm">694</a>, <a href="731.htm">731</a>, <a href="874.htm">874</a>-<a href="876.htm">876</a>, <a href="987.htm">987</a>, <a href="1047.htm">1047</a>. </p>
<p>Because this proprium that is to be removed 
is meant it is here called 'the flesh of the foreskin'. </p>
<p></p>
<p><b>[2]</b>
 There are two loves so-called, and their desires, which obstruct the influx of heavenly love from the Lord. For when these reign in 
the interior man and in the external man and take possession there they either reject or they stifle, and also degrade and defile, heavenly love flowing in, for they are absolutely contrary to heavenly 
love. The fact that they are absolutely contrary will in the Lord's Divine mercy be shown later on. To the extent they are removed however, heavenly love flowing in from the Lord starts to make its 
appearance, and in fact starts to dawn in his interior man; and to that extent he starts to notice first that he is under the influence of evil and falsity, then that he is under the influence of what 
is impure and filthy, and lastly that this has been his proprium. </p>
<p></p>
<p><b>[3]</b>
 It is with those who are being regenerated that those loves are removed. That removal may also be recognized from what goes 
on in those who are not regenerate when the desires belonging to those loves become quiescent, as happens sometimes when they are engaging in meditation on holy things or when they are languishing - as 
is the case with them in times of misfortune, sickness, and disease, and above all when they are about to die. At these times, since bodily and worldly interests have grown languid and are so to speak 
dead, such persons become aware of something of heavenly light and of the comfort brought by this. But with these it is not a removal of those desires, only a languishing, for the moment that these 
people return to their previous state they sink back into those desires. </p>
<p></p>
<p><b>[4]</b>
 With the evil as well, bodily and worldly interests can be made to languish, in which case they are able to be raised up 
into, as it seems, something heavenly, as is sometimes done to souls, especially those newly arrived in the next life, who have an intense desire to see the glory of the Lord because during their lifetime 
in the world they have heard so much about heaven. At such times their external interests languish and in this condition they are conveyed into the first heaven and enjoy what they have desired. 
But they are not able to remain there for long because their bodily and worldly interests are merely quiescent and have not been removed, as they have been with angels, regarding which see <a href="541.htm">541</a>, <a href="542.htm">542</a>. 
It should be realized that with man heavenly love from the Lord is flowing in constantly, and that nothing else stands in the way, obstructs, or prevents the reception of it than the desires belonging 
to those loves, and the falsities resulting from them. </p>

`Circumcidetis carnem praeputii vestri': quod significet remotionem amoris sui et mundi, constat ex repraesentatione et significatione `circumcisionis' quod sit purificatio a spurcis amoribus, de qua 
mox supra n. 2039; tum a significatione `carnis' quod sit proprium hominis, de qua prius n. 999; proprium hominis non est nisi amor sui et mundi, ita omnis cupiditas quae inde, quod quam spurcum sit, 
ostensum (o)est in Parte Prima n. 141, 150, 154, 210, 215, 694, 731, 874-876, 987, 1047; quia hoc proprium significatur quod removendum, hic dicitur `caro praeputii.'  [2] Sunt bini {1} amores ita dicti, 
et eorum cupiditates, quae impediunt influxum amoris caelestis a Domino; illi enim cum regnant in interiore et externo homine, et eum occupant, tunc influentem amorem caelestem vel rejiciunt vel 
suffocant, ut et pervertunt et contaminant, nam prorsus contrarii sunt amori caelesti; quod prorsus contrarii sint, ex Divina Domini Misericordia, in sequentibus demonstrabitur; at quantum removentur, 
tantum amor caelestis influens a Domino incipit apparere, immo illucescere in interiore ejus homine, et tantum incipit videre quod in malo et falso sit, (o)immo dein in immundo et spurco, denique quod 
hoc fuerit ipsius proprium; [3] sunt ii qui regenerantur apud quos illi removentur; hoc quoque a non regeneratis potest appercipi, apud quos dum amorum istorum cupiditates quiescunt, ut fit quandoque 
dum in meditatione sancta sunt vel dum sopiuntur, quod fit dum in infortuniis sunt, in aegritudinibus et morbis et maxime in momentis mortis, tunc quia corporea et mundana sopita sunt et quasi mortua, 
appercipiunt aliquid luminis caelestis, et solatii inde; sed apud hos non est remotio illarum cupiditatum, sed modo sopitio, nam ilico dum in statum  pristinum redeunt, in cupiditates illas relabuntur: 
[4] apud malos etiam sopiri possunt corporea et mundana, et tunc elevari quasi in quoddam caeleste, ut quandoque fit cum animabus, imprimis recentibus in altera vita, qui intense cupiunt videre 
gloriam Domini quia tantum de caelo audiverunt in mundo cum vixerunt; illis tunc sopiuntur externa illa, et sic evehuntur in primum caelum, et fruuntur desiderio suo; sed non diu subsistere possunt, quia 
est modo quiescentia {2} corporeorum et mundanorum, non autem remotio ut apud {3} angelos, de quibus videatur n. 541, 542.  Sciendum est quod amor caelestis a Domino continue influat apud hominem, 
et quod nihil aliud sit quod obstat, impedit, et facit quod {4} illum recipere nequeat, quam cupiditates amorum illorum et falsitates inde. 	@1 i hi$ 	@2 sopitio.$ 	@3 `i regeneratos et.$ 	@4 ut.$ </p>
