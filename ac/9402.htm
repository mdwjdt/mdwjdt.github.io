Verses 9-11. And there went up Moses and Aaron, Nadab and Abihu, and seventy of the elders of Israel; and they saw the God of Israel; and there was under His feet as a work of a sapphire stone, and as 
the substance of heaven in respect to cleanness. And unto the sons of Israel who were set apart, He sent not His hand: and they saw God, and did eat and drink. "And there went up Moses and Aaron, Nadab 
and Abihu," signifies the Word in the internal and external senses, and doctrine from both; "and seventy of the elders of Israel," signifies all who are in good from truths; "and they saw the God 
of Israel," signifies the coming and presence of the Lord in the Word; "and under His feet," signifies the ultimate sense which is the sense of the letter itself; "there was as a work of a sapphire stone," 
signifies what is translucid there from internal truths, and all things from the Lord; "and as the substance of heaven in respect to cleanness," signifies the shining through of the angelic heaven; 
"and unto the sons of Israel who were set apart," signifies those who are in the external sense alone separate from the internal; "He sent not His hand," signifies that truth is not there in its power; 
"and they saw God," signifies faith; "and did eat and drink," signifies instruction about the good and truth of worship. </p>

Verses 9-11 And Moses and Aaron went up, Nadab and Abihu, and seventy of the elders of Israel. And they saw the God of Israel; and under His feet there was so to speak a work of sapphire stone, and it 
was like the substance of the sky for clearness. And on the children of Israel who had been set apart He did not lay a hand;<A name="fntext1"></a><A href="#fn1"><sup>a</sup></a> and they saw God, and ate and drank.  </p>
<p>'And Moses and Aaron went up, Nadab 
and Abihu' means the Word in its inward and outward senses, and teachings derived from both senses. 'And seventy of the elders of Israel' means all who are governed by good which results from truths. 
'And they saw the God of Israel' means the Lord's coming and presence in the Word. 'And under His feet' means the lowest level of meaning, which is that of the letter itself. 'There was so to speak 
a work of sapphire stone' means that it is translucent with inner truths on that level, and that all things in it are translucent from the Lord. 'And it was like the substance of the sky for clearness' 
means the translucence of the angelic heaven. 'And on the children of Israel who had been set apart' means those restricted to the outward sense, separated from the inward. 'He did not lay a hand' 
means that truth in its power is not present there. 'And they saw God' means faith. 'And ate and drank' means being told about the good and truth of worship.

Vers. 9-11.  Et ascendit Moscheh et Aharon, Nadab et Abihu, et septuaginta ex senioribus Israelis.  Et viderunt Deum Israelis, et sub pedibus Ipsius sicut opus lapidis sapphiri, et sicut substantia 
caeli quoad munditiem.  Et ad sepositos filios Israelis non misit manum suam; et viderunt Deum, et comederunt et biberunt.  `Et ascendit Moscheh et Aharon, Nadab et Abihu' significat Verbum in sensu interno 
et externo, ac doctrinam ex utroque:  `et septuaginta ex senioribus (x)Israelis' significat omnes qui in bono ex veris: `et viderunt Deum Israelis' significat adventum et praesentiam Domini in 
Verbo: `et sub pedibus Ipsius' significat ultimum sensum, qui est sensus ipsius litterae:  `sicut opus lapidis sapphiri' significat ibi translucidum a veris internis, et omnia a Domino: `et sicut substantia 
caeli quoad munditiem' significat translucentiam caeli angelici: `et ad sepositos filios Israelis' significat illos qui in solo sensu externo separato ab interno: `non misit manum suam' significat 
quod ibi non verum in sua potentia: `et viderunt Deum' significat fidem: `et comederunt et biberunt' significat informationem de bono et vero cultus. </p>
