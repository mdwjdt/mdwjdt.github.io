<h3 align="center" class="ired">属天的奥秘 第3564节</h3>
<h4 align="center"></h4><p><strong>3564.</strong>“以撒就辨不出他来，因为他手上有毛，像他哥哥以扫的手一样”表他通过在外面的意愿发觉它是属世良善。这从以下事实清楚可知：他没有认出雅各是雅各，也就是“雅各”所代表的真理，反而觉得<br />他是以扫，也就是在外面的属世良善。他有这样的感觉是由于刚才所说的流注（<a href="3563.htm">3563</a>节）。因为内层良善与外层良善之间凭平行关系而存在一种交流（<a href="1831.htm">1831</a>-<a href="1832.htm">1832</a>，<a href="3514.htm">3514</a>节），而良善与真理之间则不存在，除非良善按照刚才描述的那样流入真理。</p>

And he recognized him not, because his hands were hairy like his brother Esau's hands. That this signifies that from the will part which was without it was perceived that it was natural good, is evident 
from the fact that he did not recognize Jacob to be Jacob, that is, the truth which Jacob represents; but he perceived Esau, that is, the natural good which was without; and this because of the influx 
spoken of above (n. 3563), for between interior good and exterior good there is communication, because there is parallelism (n. 1831-1832, 3514); but not between good and truth, unless the influx 
of good into truth is such as has been described just above. </p>

'And he did not recognize him because his hands were hairy like the hands of Esau his brother' means that from the will which occupied an external position he perceived that it was natural good. This 
is evident from the fact that he did not recognize Jacob as Jacob, that is, as the truth which 'Jacob' represents, but perceived him as Esau, that is, as natural good which exists outwardly. He did so 
because of an influx, dealt with immediately above in <a href="3563.htm">3563</a>. For between interior good and exterior good a communication takes place by virtue of parallelism, <a href="1831.htm">1831</a>, <a href="1832.htm">1832</a>, <a href="3514.htm">3514</a>, but not between good and 
truth unless the influx of good into truth is such as that described immediately above. </p>

</p><b>3564.</b>
Quod `non agnovit illum, quia erant manus ejus sicut manus Esavi fratris ejus pilosae' significet quod ex voluntario quod extus, perciperet quod esset bonum naturale, patet ex eo quod non agnoverit 
Jacobum pro Jacobo, hoc est, verum quod `Jacobus' repraesentat, sed quod perceperit `Esavum,' hoc est, bonum naturale quod extus, et hoc propter influxum, de quo mox supra n. 3563; inter bonum enim interius 
et bonum exterius datur communicatio, quia parallelismus, n. 1831, 1832, 3514, non autem inter bonum et verum, nisi influxus boni in verum sit talis qualis mox supra descriptus est. </p>
