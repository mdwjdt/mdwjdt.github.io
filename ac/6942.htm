<h3 align="center" class="ired">属天的奥秘 第6942节</h3>
<h4 align="center"></h4><p><h4 align="center">内义</h4><br />6942.出埃及记4:1-4.摩西回答说，看哪，他们必不信我，也不听我的声音；因为他们必说，耶和华并没有被你看见！耶和华对他说，你手里是什么？他说，一根杖。耶和华说，把它丢在地上。他一丢在地上，它就变作蛇；摩西就从它面前逃离。耶和华对摩西说，伸出手来捉住它的尾巴；他就伸出手来，捉住它，它在他手中变成杖。<br />“摩西回答说”表出于神之律法的思维。“看哪，他们必不信我，也不听我的声音”表那些属于属灵教会的人不会有信，因而不会接受。“因为他们必说，耶和华并没有被你看见”表在主的人身里面的神性。“耶和华对他说”表预见他们没有信将是什么样。“你手里是什么？他说，一根杖”表主之神性人身的能力。“耶和华说，把它丢在地上。他一丢在地上”表主的神性属世层的能力进入感官层的流注。“它就变作蛇”表由此与内在分离的人心智的感官和肉体层，或由此与内在分离的感官和肉体人。“摩西就从它面前逃离”表分离的感官层所造成的恐惧。“耶和华对摩西说”表来自神性的提供。“伸出手来捉住它的尾巴”表从感官层的最末部分提升某种事物的能力。“他就伸出手来，捉住它”表朝向内层的一种提升。“它在他手中又变成杖”表这时，来自神性的能力被赐予。</p>

THE INTERNAL SENSE.      Verses 1-4. And Moses answered, and said, And behold they will not believe me, and will not hear my voice; for they will say, Jehovah hath not been seen of thee. And Jehovah 
said unto him, What is that in thy hand? And he said, A rod. And He said, Cast it to the earth. And he cast it to the earth, and it became a serpent, and Moses fled from before it. And Jehovah said unto 
Moses, Put forth thy hand, and take hold of its tail; and he put forth his hand, and took hold of it, and it became a rod in his hand. "And Moses answered and said," signifies thought from the law 
Divine; "And behold they will not believe me, and will not hear my voice," signifies that those who are of the spiritual church would not have faith, thus would not receive; "for they will say, Jehovah 
hath not been seen of thee," signifies the Divine of the Lord in His Human; "and Jehovah said unto him," signifies foresight as to what they would be if they had not faith; "What is that in thy hand? 
And he said, A rod," signifies the power of the Lord's Divine Human; "and He said, Cast it to the earth," signifies the influx of the power of the Lord's Divine natural into the sensuous; "and it became 
a serpent," signifies the sensuous and corporeal man thereby separated from the internal; "and Moses fled from before it," signifies horror at the sensuous separated; "and Jehovah said unto Moses," 
signifies providence from the Divine; "Put forth thy hand, and take hold of its tail," signifies the power of uplifting from the ultimate sensuous; "and he put forth his hand, and took hold of it," 
signifies an uplifting toward the interiors "and it became a rod in his hand," signifies that then power was communicated from the Divine. </p>

THE INTERNAL SENSE </p>
<p>Verses 1-4 And Moses answered and said, And behold, they will not believe me, and will not hear my voice; for they will say, Jehovah has not appeared to you. And Jehovah said to 
him, What is that in your hand? And he said, A rod. And He said, Throw it to the earth. And he threw it to the earth, and it was made into a serpent; and Moses fled from before it. And Jehovah said to 
Moses, Put out your hand and take hold of its tail. And he put out his hand and took hold of it, and it was made into a rod in the palm of his hand. </p>
<p>'And Moses answered and said' means thought coming 
from the law of God. 'And behold, they will not believe me, and will not hear my voice means that those who belonged to the spiritual Church would not be in possession of faith and so would be unreceptive. 
'For they will say, Jehovah has not appeared to you' means the Lord's Divine within His Human. 'And Jehovah said to him' means foresight of what they were going to be like if they did not possess 
faith. 'What is that in your hand? And he said, A rod' means the power of the Lord's Divine Human. 'And He said, Throw it to the earth. And he threw it to the earth' means an influx of the power 
of the Lord's Divine Natural into the sensory level. 'And it was made into a serpent' means the sensory and bodily level of a person's mind separated from the internal as a result. 'And Moses fled from 
before it' means a feeling of horror caused by the separated sensory level. 'And Jehovah said to Moses' means providence on the part of the Divine. 'Put out your hand and take hold of the tail' means 
the power of raising something from the last part of the sensory level. 'And he put out his hand and took hold of it' means raising it towards more internal levels. 'And it was made into a rod in 
the palm of his hand' means that at this point the power from the Divine was imparted. </p>

SENSUS INTERNUS </p>
<p>Vers. 1-4.  Et respondit Moscheh, et dixit, Et ecce non credent mihi, et non audient vocem meam, quia dicent, Non visus ad te Jehovah.  Et dixit ad illum Jehovah, Quid istud in manu 
tua? et dixit, Baculus.  Et dixit, Projice illum terram; et projecit illum terram, et factus in serpentem, et fugit Moscheh a coram eo.  Et dixit Jehovah ad Moschen, Mitte manum tuam, et prehende caudam 
ejus; et misit manum suam, et apprehendit eum, et factus in baculum in vola {1}illius.  `Et respondit Moscheh, et dixit' significat cogitationem a lege Divina: `Et ecce non credent mihi, et non 
audient vocem meam' significat illos qui ab Ecclesia spirituali, quod non fidem haberent, ita non {2}reciperent: `quia dicent, Non visus ad te Jehovah' significat Divinum Domini in Humano Ipsius: `Et 
dixit ad illum Jehovah' significat praevidentiam quales futuri si non fidem haberent: `Quid istud in manu tua? et dixit, Baculus' significat potentiam Divini Humani Domini: `et dixit, Projice illum terram; 
et projecit illum terram' significat potentiae Divini Naturalis Domini influxum in sensuale: `et factus in serpentem' significat inde sensualem et corporeum hominem separatum ab interno: `et fugit 
Moscheh a coram illo' significat horrorem pro sensuali separato: `et dixit Jehovah ad Moschen' significat providentiam a Divino: `Mitte manum tuam, et prehende caudam' significat potentiam elevandi 
a sensualis ultimo: `et misit manum suam, et apprehendit eum' significat elevationem versus interiora: `et factus in baculum in vola illius' significat quod tunc communicata potentia a Divino. 	@1 ejus
