<h3 align="center" class="ired">属天的奥秘 第6195节</h3>
<h4 align="center"></h4><p><strong>6195.</strong>有些灵人曾长期与我同在，他们既不特别好，也不特别坏，就在我的头顶稍向上一点。他们拥有深深流入人们情感的能力，因为这就是他们想要做的；过了一会儿，他们也进入我的情感，并以这种方式将他们自己与我绑在一起：他们好像难以分开。对此，我与他们进行了交谈，说他们应该和我分开；但他们却做不到。当他们试图这样做，并且稍稍成功时，他们使我的思维如此迟钝，以致我若不以一种混乱且不连贯的方式，就无法进行思考；我感到一种头痛，就像那些陷入昏厥的人所感受的那种。这向我表明爱以哪种方式进行联结，并且在来世，所有人都通过爱被联结在一起。这就是为什么进入别人的实际情感的灵人会占有他的原因，犹如世上当一个人沉迷于另一个人的爱时所发生的情形。不过，真理不会将人们联结起来，只有对真理的情感才会进行联结。<br />由此清楚向我表明一个人如何通过自己的爱要么与天堂联结，要么与地狱联结。他通过对自己和世界的爱与地狱联结，通过对邻舍和神的爱与天堂联结。由此还向我清楚表明，一个与地狱绑在一起的人若不通过主所采用的神性方法，绝无可能得以释放；这一点也通过那些通过轻微的情感与我绑在一起的人被指示给我。我若不通过居间的爱，就无法从他们当中解脱出来；他们通过这些爱逐渐与其他人联结。当这些灵人被分开时，他们似乎被移到左前方，离我有一段距离。我发现，这种分开是通过我的情感状态的变化发生的；因为随着我的情感发生变化，这些灵人也离开了我。这也向我显明来世的距离表象从何而来。</p>

There were spirits with me a long time, neither very good nor very evil, a little above the head. They had the power to inflow deeply into the affections, and because they so willed, after a while they 
entered, and then bound themselves with me in such a manner that it seemed as if they could scarcely be separated. I spoke with them in regard to this, saying that they ought to separate themselves; 
but they could not. When they attempted it, and separated themselves a little, they then so dulled my thoughts that I could not think except confusedly and disconnectedly, and a painful sensation was 
felt in my head, like that with those who fall into a swoon. By this it was made evident in what manner loves conjoin, and that thereby is the conjunction of all in the other life. Wherefore spirits 
who enter into the very affections possess the other, as is also the case In the world when a man favors another's love; whereas truths do not conjoin, but the affections of truth. From this it was made 
evident to me how man is conjoined either with heaven or with hell, namely, by means of his loves; with hell by means of the loves of self and of the world, but with heaven by means of the loves of 
the neighbor and of God. It was also evident that a man bound to hell can in no wise be loosed therefrom except through Divine means by the Lord; as was also shown from those who were bound with me 
only by slight affections, and yet I was not loosed from them except by means of intermediate loves, whereby they were gradually conjoined with others. And as they were separated they appeared to be removed 
to a distance from me toward the left in front, and the separation was observed by means of changes of state of the affections; for as the affections were changed, so they receded. From this it 
is also evident whence come the appearances of distance in the other life. </p>

Some spirits were once present with me for a long time, neither particularly good nor particularly evil ones, a little way above my head. They had the ability to flow deeply into people's affections; 
and because this was what they wanted to do, they also entered mine after a while and tied themselves to me in such a way that it seemed as though they could hardly be separated. I talked to them about 
what was going on, saying that they ought to separate themselves from me. But they could not do it. When they tried to do so and did succeed to some small extent, they then caused my thinking to be 
so dull that I could not think except in a confused and disjointed manner; and I felt pain in my head like that experienced by people who are fainting. This showed me how people's loves serve to join 
them together and that all in the next life are joined together through them. This is the reason why spirits who enter the actual affections of another take possession of him, just as happens in the 
world when one person indulges another person's love. But truths do not join people together, only affections for truth do so. </p>

<p><b>[2]</b>
 From this it has become clear to me how a person is joined either 
to heaven or to hell, namely through his loves. He is joined to hell through his self-love and love of the world, but to heaven through his love of the neighbour and love of God. In addition it has been 
clear to me that a person tied to hell cannot possibly be released except by Divine means employed by the Lord, as has also been shown to me from those who have been tied to me by merely slender affections. 
I was not released from them except through intermediate kinds of love, by means of which they were gradually joined to others. As the spirits were separated they seemed to be placed further 
away from me, in front and to the left. I noticed that the separation took place through changes in the state of my affections; for as my affections changed, so those spirits departed from me. This also 
revealed to me where the appearances of distance in the next life originate. </p>

</p><b>6195.</b>
Fuerunt spiritus diu apud me, non ita boni nec ita mali, paulo supra caput, potuerunt influere penitus in affectiones, et quia hoc volebant, etiam per moram intrarunt et se ligaverunt mecum ita ut videretur 
sicut vix possent separari; locutus sum cum illis de ea re, et quod oporteat ut separentur, sed non potuerunt; cum id tentabant et se separabant paulum, tunc cogitationes  meas ita hebetabant 
ut non nisi quam confuse et abrupte cogitare possem, et sentiebatur in capite meo dolorificum quale illis qui in deliquium cadunt.  Inde patuit quomodo amores conjungunt, et quod inde conjunctio omnium 
in altera vita; quapropter spiritus qui intrant in ipsas affectiones, possident alterum; sicut etiam fit in mundo cum homo favet alterius amori; at vera non conjungunt sed affectiones veri.  [2]Inde 
constare mihi potuit quomodo homo conjungitur vel cum caelo vel cum inferno, quod nempe per amores; per amores sui et mundi cum inferno, at per amores proximi et Dei cum caelo.  Tum quoque constabat 
quod homo ligatus inferno nusquam possit solvi inde nisi per Divina media a Domino, quod etiam ostensum ab illis qui mecum ligati fuerunt modo per leves affectiones; ab illis solutus sum non nisi quam 
per intermedios amores, per quos cum aliis conjungebantur per gradus; et sicut separabantur, ita apparuerunt elongari a me versus sinistrum antrorsum; et observata est separatio per {1}mutationes status 
affectionum, nam sicut affectiones mutabantur, ita recedebant.  Inde etiam patet unde apparentiae distantiarum in altera vita. @1 I has mutatione; should be either mutationem or as above$ </p>
