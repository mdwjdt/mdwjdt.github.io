<h3 align="center" class="ired">属天的奥秘 第5329节</h3>
<h4 align="center"></h4><p><strong>5329.</strong>“在埃及全地”表在属世层的这两个部分中。这从“埃及全地”的含义清楚可知，“埃及全地”是指属世层的这两个部分，如前所述（<a href="5276.htm">5276</a>节）。当世人读到“法老就摘下手上的戒指，戴在约瑟的手上，给他穿上细麻衣，把金颈链戴在他的颈项上。又叫约瑟坐他的副车，有人在他前面喊着：跪下！于是，法老派他治理埃及全地”时，这就是天使所觉察到的事物。事实上，天使根本不可能觉察到这些历史细节本身，因为它们都是诸如属于世界，而非天堂的那类事物；他们看不见属于世界的事物。然而，由于世界上的一切事物都与天堂的某种事物都有一种对应关系，所以当世人感知世俗事物时，天使感知到的是天上的事物。若非如此，天上的天使永远可能与人同在。但是，为了天使能与人同在，圣言已经被赐下，天使在圣言中能感知到一种神性的圣洁，他们能将这圣洁传给与其同在的那个人。</p>

In all the land of Egypt. That this signifies in both naturals, is evident from the signification of "all the land of Egypt," as being both naturals (of which above, n. 5276). Such then are the things 
the angels perceive when man reads that "Pharaoh took off his ring from upon his hand, and put it upon Joseph's hand, and clothed him in garments of fine linen, and put a necklace of gold upon his neck, 
and made him ride in the second chariot he had, and they cried before him, Abrech, and he set him over all the land of Egypt;" for the angels cannot possibly perceive the historicals themselves, 
because they are such things as are of the world, and not such as are of heaven, and the things of the world do not appear to them. Yet because there is a correspondence of all things in the world with 
those in heaven, the angels perceive heavenly things when man perceives worldly ones. Unless this were the case no angel from heaven could possibly be with man. But in order that angels may be with 
man, the Word has been given, in which the angels may perceive a Divine holiness which they can communicate to the man with whom they are present. </p>

<p align="center"><b>Elliott(1983-1999) 5329</b></p><p><b>5329.</b>
'In all the land of Egypt' means in both parts of the natural. This is clear from the meaning of 'all the land of Egypt' as both parts of the natural, dealt with above in <a href="5276.htm">5276</a>. Matters like those that 
are being presented now are what angels perceive when man reads, </p>
<p>Pharaoh took off his ring from upon his hand and put it onto Joseph's hand, and clothed him in robes of fine linen, and placed a chain 
of gold onto his neck. And he made him ride in the second chariot that he had; and they cried out before him, Abrek! and he set him over all the land of Egypt. </p>
<p></p>
<p><b>[2]</b>
 For angels cannot have any perception 
at all of actual historical details since these are the kind of things that belong to the world and not to heaven; things that belong to the world are not seen by them. Yet because everything 
in the world has a correspondence with something in heaven angels therefore have a perception of heavenly things when man's perception is of worldly ones. If this were not so no angel from heaven could 
ever be present with man; but so that an angel can be present with him the Word has been provided, in which angels perceive a Divine holiness that they can communicate to the person with whom they 
are present. </p>

`In omni terra Aegypti': quod significet in utroque naturali, constat ex significatione `omnis terrae Aegypti' quod sit utrumque naturale, de qua supra n. 5276. Talia nunc sunt quae angeli percipiunt 
cum homo (m)legit quod {1}'Pharaoh removerit annulum suum a super manu sua, et dederit illum super manum Josephi, et vestiverit eum vestibus byssi, et posuerit torquem auri super collum ejus; et vehi 
fecerit eum in curru secundario, qui sibi, et clamaverint ante eum Abrech, dando eum super omnem terram Aegypti';(n) [2] angeli enim ipsa historica nequaquam possunt percipere quia sunt talia quae sunt 
mundi, non autem quae sunt caeli; quae mundi sunt, illis non apparent; at quia correspondentia est omnium quae in mundo cum illis quae in caelo, ideo angeli caelestia percipiunt cum homo mundana; 
{2} nisi ita foret, nequaquam aliquis angelus e caelo apud hominem potuisset esse; ut autem possit, datum est {3}Verbum, in quo angeli percipiant sanctum Divinum quod {4}possint communicare homini apud 
quem {5}adsunt. @1 A has `removit Pharaoh ---- vers', evidently a reminder to quote vv. 42, 43 in full when writing final draft$ @2 et$ @3 homini Verbum, ex quo percipere potest$ @4 ibi, et id$ @5 adest$ </p>
