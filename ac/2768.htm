<h3 align="center" class="ired">属天的奥秘 第2768节</h3>
<h4 align="center"></h4><p><strong>2768.</strong>“神要试验亚伯拉罕”表主的最严厉、最内在的试探。这从下文清楚可知。就内义而言，“亚伯拉罕”代表和表示主，这从目前有关亚伯拉罕的一切论述明显看出来。下文将说明，本章就内义而言，描述的是主经受最严厉、最内在的试探。“神试探”这句话是照字义说的，从字面上看，试探和许多其它事都被归给了神。但根据内义，神不试探任何人。在试探期间，神尽可能不断将这人从试探中释放出来，或尽量使这种释放不造成伤害。祂不断着眼于善，将经历试探的人引入这善中，因为神从不以任何其它方式参与试探。尽管经上论及神时会说，祂允许，但这不是照着人对允许的概念来说的，也就是说，祂通过允许而赞同。人只会这样理解允许：即凡允许的也愿意。事实上，正是人里面的邪恶造成、甚至引向试探。试探的起因不在神那里，就象人作恶并受到相应惩罚时，起因不在国王或法官那里一样。因为人若离弃神序法则（一切神序法则都是良善的法则和由此而来的真理的法则），就会臣服于违反神序的法则，也就是那些恶与假的法则，以及由此而来的惩罚和折磨的法则。</p>

That God did tempt Abraham. That this signifies the Lord's most grievous and inmost temptations, is evident from what follows. That in the internal sense by "Abraham" is represented and meant the Lord, 
is manifest from all that precedes where Abraham is treated of. That the Lord suffered most grievous and inmost temptations, which are described in this chapter in the internal sense, will be made 
evident. But its being said that "God did tempt," is according to the sense of the letter, in which temptations and many other things are attributed to God; but it is according to the internal sense that 
God tempts no one; but in the time of temptations is continually liberating from them, as far as possible, or as far as the liberation does not do harm, and is continually looking to the good into 
which He is leading him who is in the temptations; for God never takes part in temptations in any other manner; and though it is predicated of Him that He permits, still it is not according to the idea 
which man has of permission, namely, that by permitting He concurs. Man cannot comprehend it in any other manner than that he who permits is also willing; but it is the evil within the man which causes, 
and even leads into the temptation; and no cause of this is in God-as the cause is not in the king or in the judge, when a man does evil and suffers punishment therefor. For he who separates himself 
from the laws of Divine order, all of which are the laws of good and thence of truth, casts himself into the laws that are opposite to Divine order, which are those of evil and falsity, and thence 
of punishments and torments. </p>

'That God tempted Abraham' means the Lord's severest and inmost temptations. This is clear from what follows. Abraham represents, and in the internal sense means, the Lord, as is evident from all that 
has been said so far where Abraham is the subject. And the fact that the Lord underwent severest and inmost temptations, which are described in the internal sense of this chapter, will be shown below. 
As regards the words 'God tempted', these are used in accordance with the sense of the letter in which temptations and many other things are attributed to God. But in accordance with the internal sense 
the truth is that God does not tempt anyone. In times of temptation He is constantly delivering the person from it, as far as possible, that is, as far as the deliverance does no harm, and He constantly 
has good in view to which He leads the one who is undergoing temptations. For God never consents to temptations with any other objectives. </p>
<p></p>
<p><b>[2]</b>
 And although it is said of Him that He permits, 
this attribution is not made according to man's idea of permission, that is to say, that by permitting He approves Man cannot do other than have the idea that anyone who permits something also wills 
it. But it is evil residing with man which causes and even leads him into temptation. God is no more the cause of it than a king or a judge is when a person does evil and is therefore punished for it. 
For anyone who forsakes the laws of Divine order, all of which are those of good and from this of truth, makes himself subject to laws contrary to Divine order, which are those of evil and falsity, 
and consequently of punishments and torments. </p>

</p><b>2768.</b>
`Et Deus tentavit Abrahamum': quod significet tentationes gravissimas et intimas Domini, constat ab illis quae sequuntur; quod per `Abrahamum' repraesentetur, et in sensu interno intelligatur, Dominus, 
ex omnibus illis quae praecedunt ubi de Abrahamo actum, patet: quod tentationes gravissimae et intimae Domino fuerint, quae in sensu interno in hoc capite describuntur, constabit. Quod autem dicatur 
quod `Deus tentaverit,' est secundum sensum litterae, in quo tentationes et plura tribuuntur Deo; at secundum sensum internum est quod Deus neminem tentet, jugiter tunc liberando a tentationibus quantum 
possibile seu quantum liberatio non malum faciat, et jugiter tunc spectando bonum in quod ducit illum qui in tentationibus; [2] Deus enim nunquam (t)aliter concurrit cum tentationibus; et tametsi 
praedicatur de Ipso quod permittat, usque non est secundum ideam quam homo de permissione habet, nempe quod concurrat permittendo, non enim aliter capere potest homo, quam [quod] qui permittit, etiam 
velit, sed est malum apud hominem quod facit, etiam quod inducit in tentationem, cujus causa nulla est in Deo, sicut nulla est in rege aut in judice quod homo faciat malum, et propterea luat poenas; 
qui enim se separat a legibus ordinis Divini, quae omnes sunt {1}boni et inde veri, se conjicit in leges ordini Divino oppositas, quae sunt mali et falsi, et inde punitionum et cruciatuum. @1 A alters 
to ex bono but leaves veri$ </p>
