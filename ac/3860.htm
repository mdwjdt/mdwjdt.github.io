<h3 align="center" class="ired">属天的奥秘 第3860节</h3>
<h4 align="center"></h4><p><strong>3860.</strong>“利亚怀孕生子”表从外在之物到内在之物的属灵孕育和生产。这从“怀孕生子”的含义清楚可知，“怀孕生子”在内义上是指重生，因为正在重生的人被孕育和新生，所以重生被称为新生，不过是属灵的新生。诚然，人是从父母所生的一个人，但在从主重生之前，他不会成为真正的人。使得人真正成为人的，是属灵和属天的生命，因为正是这种生命将人与动物区别开来。这种属灵的怀孕和生产就是圣言所提及的怀孕和生产，以及此处“利亚怀孕生子”这句话所表示的。产生和生产就是他们所表示的信与爱的产生和生产（参看<a href="613.htm">613</a>，<a href="1145.htm">1145</a>，<a href="1255.htm">1255</a>，<a href="2020.htm">2020</a>，<a href="2584.htm">2584</a>，<a href="3856.htm">3856</a>节）。这些怀孕和生产是从外在之物到内在之物发生的，这一点由“利亚怀孕生子”这句话来表示，因为“利亚”代表对外在真理的情感（<a href="3793.htm">3793</a>，<a href="3819.htm">3819</a>节），“利百加”代表信之真理，也就是重生的第一个阶段和它所开始的外在。此中情形从下文有关利亚和拉结给雅各所生的孩子明显看出来。</p>

And Leah conceived and bare a son. That this signifies spiritual conception and birth from what is external to what is internal, is evident from the signification of "conceiving and bearing," as in the 
internal sense being to be regenerated; for the man who is being regenerated is conceived and born anew, wherefore regeneration is called a new birth, but spiritual. Man is indeed born of his parents 
as a man, but he does not become a man until he is reborn of the Lord. Spiritual and heavenly life is that which makes a man, for this distinguishes him from brute animals. It is this spiritual conception 
and birth which is signified in the Word by the conceptions and births mentioned therein; and by what is here said-that "Leah conceived and bare a son." (That the generations and nativities are 
those of faith and love, which they signify, see above, n. 613, 1145, 1255, 2020, 2584, 3856.) That these conceptions and births take place from what is external to what is internal, is signified by 
"Leah conceiving and bearing," for by Leah is represented the affection of external truth (n. 3793, 3819); and by Reuben the truth of faith, which is the first of regeneration, and the external from 
which regeneration commences. How the case herein is will appear from what follows concerning the children of Jacob by Leah and by Rachel. </p>

<p align="center"><b>Elliott(1983-1999) 3860</b></p><p><b>3860.</b>
'Leah conceived and bore a son' means spiritual conception and birth from what is external to what is internal. This is clear from the meaning of 'conceiving and bearing' in the internal sense as being 
regenerated, for a person who is being regenerated is conceived and born anew. Regeneration is for' this reason called rebirth, but that rebirth is spiritual. A person is indeed born a human being 
from his parents, but he does not become truly human until he is born again from the Lord. Spiritual and celestial life is what makes a person truly human, for that life distinguishes him from animals. 
This conception and birth is what is meant in the Word by the conceptions and births of all who are mentioned there, and by the words used here, 'Leah conceived and bore a son'. As to its being the 
generations and births of faith and love that are meant, see <a href="613.htm">613</a>, <a href="1145.htm">1145</a>, <a href="1255.htm">1255</a>, <a href="2020.htm">2020</a>, <a href="2584.htm">2584</a>, <a href="3856.htm">3856</a>. Those conceptions and births take place from what is external to what is internal, and this is meant by 
'Leah conceived and bore', for 'Leah' represents the affection for external truth, <a href="3793.htm">3793</a>, <a href="3819.htm">3819</a>, and 'Reuben' the truth of faith, which is the first stage of regeneration and the external from which it 
begins. The implications of all this will be evident from all that follows regarding Jacob's children by Leah and by Rachel. </p>

`Concepit Leah, et peperit filium': quod significet conceptionem et partum spiritualem ab externo ad internum, constat a significatione `concipere et parere' quod in sensu interno sit regenerari; 
homo enim qui regeneratur, e novo concipitur et nascitur, {1}quapropter regeneratio dicitur renascentia, sed spiritualis; nascitur quidem homo sicut homo a parentibus, sed non fit homo antequam renatus 
est a Domino; vita spiritualis et caelestis est quae facit hominem, {2}nam haec distinguit illum a brutis animalibus; haec conceptio et hic partus est qui significatur in Verbo per conceptiones 
et partus qui ibi memorantur; et per haec quod `concepit Leah et peperit filium'; </p>
<p>quod generationes et nativitates sint fidei et amoris, quae significantur, videatur n. 613, 1145, 1255, 2020, 2584, 
3856.  Quod conceptiones illae et partus (x)fiant ab externo ad internum, significatur per quod `Leah concepit et peperit,' per `Leam' enim repraesentatur affectio veri externi, n. 3793, 3819, 
et per `Reuben' verum fidei, quod est primum regenerationis, et externum a quo incohatur.  Quomodo cum his se habet, ex omnibus illis quae sequuntur de liberis Jacobi ex Leah et ex Rachele, patebit. @1
