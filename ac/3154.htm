<h4 align="center"></h4><p><strong>3154.</strong>创世记24:34-48.他说，我是亚伯拉罕的仆人。耶和华大大地赐福给我主人，使他昌大，又赐给他羊群、牛群、金银、仆婢、骆驼和驴。我主人的妻子撒拉年老的时候，给我主人生了一个儿子，我主人也将一切所有的都给了他。我主人叫我起誓说，你不要给我儿子，从我所居之地的迦南人的女子中娶一个妻子。你要往我父家、我本族那里去，为我儿子娶一个妻子。我对我主人说，恐怕那女子不肯跟我来。他就对我说，我在祂面前行走的耶和华必差遣祂的使者与你同去，叫你的道路通达，你就可以从我本族、我父家那里，给我的儿子娶一个妻子。只要你到了我本族那里，我使你起的誓就与你无干；他们若不把女子交给你，我使你起的誓也与你无干。我今日到了泉旁，便说，耶和华我主人亚伯拉罕的神啊，你若叫我所走的道路通达；看如，我站在水泉旁，但愿有一个少女出来打水，我要对她说，请你让我抿一口你瓶子里的一点水；她若对我说，你只管喝，我也为你的骆驼打水，愿她就作耶和华给我主人儿子所选定的妻。我心里的话还没有说完，看哪，利百加就出来，肩头上扛着水瓶，下到泉旁打水。我便对她说，请你给我水喝。她就急忙从身上放低水瓶说，请喝，我也给你的骆驼喝。我便喝了；她又给我的骆驼喝了。我问她说，你是谁的女儿？她说，彼土利的女儿；彼土利是拿鹤的儿子，是密迦给拿鹤生的。我就把环子戴在她鼻子上，把镯子戴在她两手上。我俯身向耶和华下拜，称颂耶和华我主人亚伯拉罕的神，因为祂引导我走在真理的路上，来给我主人的儿子娶我主人兄弟的女儿。<br />“他说，我是亚伯拉罕的仆人”表它来自神圣良善。“耶和华大大地赐福给我主人，使他昌大”表神性人的良善与真理。“又赐给他羊群、牛群”表总体上的良善。“金银”表总体上的真理。“仆婢、骆驼和驴”表具体的真理。“我主人的妻子撒拉给我主人生了一个儿子”表从神圣真理所生的神圣理性。“年老的时候”表这个状态实际存在的时候。“我主人也将一切所有的都给了他”表一切神性事物都属于神圣理性。<br />“我主人叫我起誓”在此和前面一样，表一种有约束力的承诺和一种神圣义务。“说，你不要给我儿子从迦南人的女子中娶一个妻子”在此和前面一样，表凡与真理不一致的情感，神圣理性都不可与之结合。“我所居之地”表神圣良善所在的不一致的事物。“你要往我父家那里去”表出自神性的良善。“往我本族那里去”表出自神性的真理。“为我儿子娶一个妻子”表由此产生联结。<br />“我对我主人说，恐怕那女子不肯跟我来”在此和前面一样，表属世人怀疑那情感是否可以分离。“他就对我说”表教导。“我在祂面前行走的耶和华必差遣祂的使者与你同去”在此和前面一样，表神的旨意（Divine Providence）。“叫你的道路通达”表在真理方面。“你就可以给我的儿子娶一个妻子”表会产生联结。“从我本族、我父家那里”表从出自神性的良善与真理那里。“我使你起的誓就与你无干”在此和前面一样，表属世人所拥有的自由。“只要你到了我本族那里，他们若不把女子交给你”表就分离而言。“我使你起的誓也与你无干”表这种情况下，属世人没有责任。剩下的经文，直到48节，和前面部分所表相同。</p>

Verses 34-48. And he said, I am Abraham's servant. And Jehovah hath blessed my lord exceedingly, and hath made him great, and hath given him flock and herd, and silver and gold, and menservants and maidservants, 
and camels and asses. And Sarah, my lord's wife, bare a son to my lord after she was old; and he hath given unto him all that he hath. And my lord made me swear, saying, Thou shalt not take 
a woman for my son of the daughters of the Canaanite, in whose land I dwell. But thou shalt go unto my father's house, and to my family, and take a woman for my son. And I said unto my lord, Peradventure 
the woman will not follow me. And he said unto me, Jehovah, before whom I have walked, will send His angel with thee, and prosper thy way; and thou shalt take a woman for my son from my family, 
and from my father's house. Then shalt thou be clear from my oath, when thou comest to my family; and if they give not to thee, thou shalt be clear from my oath. And I came this day unto the fountain, 
and said, O Jehovah God of my lord Abraham, if now Thou do prosper my way wherein I do walk; behold I stand by the fountain of waters; and let it come to pass that the maiden which cometh forth to draw, 
and to whom I shall say, Let me drink, I pray, a little water from thy pitcher; and she shall say to me, Both drink thou, and I will also draw for thy camels, let her be the woman whom Jehovah hath 
appointed for my lord's son. I scarcely had done speaking in my heart, when behold Rebekah came forth, and her pitcher on her shoulder; and she went down unto the fountain and drew; and I said into 
her, Let me drink, I pray. And she made haste, and let down her pitcher from upon her, and said, Drink, and I will give thy camels drink also; and I drank, and she gave drink to the camels also. And 
I asked her, and said, Whose daughter art thou? And she said, The daughter of Bethuel, the son of Nahor, whom Milcah bare unto him. And I put the jewel upon her nose, and the bracelets upon her hands. 
And I bent and bowed myself down to Jehovah, and blessed Jehovah God of my lord Abraham, who led me into the way of truth, to take the daughter of my lord's brother for his son. [2] "He said, I am Abraham's 
servant," signifies that it was from the Divine good; "and Jehovah hath blessed my lord exceedingly, and hath made him great," signifies the Divine Human as to good and as to truth; "and hath 
given him flock and herd," signifies goods in general; "and silver and gold," signifies truths in general; "and menservants and maidservants, and camels and asses," signifies truths specifically. "And 
Sarah, my lord's wife, bare a son to my lord," signifies the Divine rational, from Divine truth; "after she was old," signifies when the state was; "and he hath given unto him all that he hath," signifies 
that to the Divine rational belong all Divine things.  [3] "And my lord made me swear," signifies here as before, a binding pledge, and a sacred obligation; "saying, Thou shalt not take a woman 
for my son of the daughters of the Canaanite," signifies here as before, that the Divine rational was not to be conjoined with any affection not in agreement with truth; "in whose land I dwell," signifies 
the discordant things in which Divine good is. "But thou shalt go unto my father's house," signifies good which is from the Divine; "and to my family," signifies truth which is from the Divine; 
"and take a woman for my son," signifies that thence should be conjunction. [4] "And I said unto my lord, Peradventure the woman will not follow me," signifies here as before the doubting of the natural 
mind concerning that affection, as to whether it was separable; "and he said unto me," signifies instruction; "Jehovah, before whom I have walked, will send His angel with thee," signifies here as 
before, the Divine providence; "and prosper thy way," signifies as to truth; "and thou shalt take a woman for my son," signifies that there should be conjunction; "from my family, and from my father's 
house," signifies from the good and truth which are there from the Divine. "Then shalt thou be clear from my oath," signifies here as before, the freedom which the natural man has; "when thou comest 
to my family, and if they give not to thee," signifies as to the separation; "thou shalt be free from my oath," signifies that then there shall be no blame to the natural man. The other words, to verse 
48, signify the same as before. </p>

Verses 34-48 And he said, I am Abraham's servant. And Jehovah has blessed my master greatly and has made him great, and has given him flocks and herds, and silver and gold, and male and female servants, 
and camels and asses. And Sarah my master's wife bore a son to my master in her old age; and to him he has given all that he has. And my master made me swear, saying, You shall not take a wife for 
my son from the daughters of the Canaanites, in whose land I am dwelling; but you shall go to my father's house, and to my family, and you shall take a wife for my son. And I said to my master, Perhaps 
the woman is not going to follow me. And he said to me, Jehovah, before whom I have walked, will send His angel with you and will prosper your way; and you shall take a wife for my son from my family 
and from my father's house. Then you will be clear from my oath because you have come to my family; and if they will not give her to you, you will be clear from my oath. And I came today to me spring 
and said, O Jehovah, the God of my master Abraham, if You will, prosper now my way which I am walking in. Behold, I am standing at a spring of water; and let it be that the young woman going out to 
draw, to whom I say, Give me a drink now of a little water from your pitcher, and she says to me, Drink, and I will also draw for your camels - let her be the woman whom Jehovah has appointed for my 
master's son. I had scarcely finished speaking in my heart, and behold, Rebekah came out, with her pitcher on her shoulder; and she went down to the spring and drew, and I said to her, Give me a drink 
now. And she hastened and lowered her pitcher from upon her, and said, Drink, and also I will give your camels a drink; and I drank, and she gave the camels also a drink. And I asked her and said, Whose 
daughter are you? And she said, The daughter of Bethuel, Nahor's son, whom Milkah bore to him. And I put a jewel on her nose, and bracelets on her hands. And I bowed, and bowed down to Jehovah, and 
blessed Jehovah, the God of my master Abraham, who led me into the way of truth to take the daughter of my master's brother for his son. </p>
<p>'He said, I am Abraham's servant' means that it was from Divine 
Good. 'And Jehovah has blessed my master greatly and has made him great' means the Divine Human as regards good and as regards truth. 'And has given him flocks and herds' means goods in general. 
'And silver and gold' means truths in general. 'And male and female servants, and camels and asses' means truths specifically. 'And Sarah my master's wife bore a son to my master' means the Divine Rational 
born from Divine Truth. 'In her old age' means when that state actually existed. 'And to him he has given all that he has' means that all Divine things are His. 'And my master made me swear' means 
here, as previously, a binding and solemn undertaking. 'Saying! You shall not take a wife for my son from the daughters of the Canaanites' means here, as previously, that the Divine Rational should 
not be joined to any affection incompatible with truth. 'In whose land I am dwelling' means incompatible things in which Divine good is present. 'But you shall go to my father's house' means good which 
comes from the Divine. 'And to my family' means truth which comes from the Divine. 'And you shall take a wife for my son' means that from this a joining together would be effected. 'And I said to 
my master, Perhaps the woman is not going to follow me' means here, as previously, doubt in the natural man as to whether that affection was separable. 'And he said to me' means instruction. 'Jehovah, 
before whom I have walked, will send His angel with you' means here, as previously, Divine Providence. 'And will prosper your way' means as regards truth. 'And you shall take a wife for my son' means 
that a joining together would be effected. 'From my family and from my father's house' means from the good and truth that came from the Divine there. 'Then you will be clear from my oath' means here, 
as previously, the freedom which the natural man has. 'Because you have come to my family; and if they will not give her to you' means as regards separation. 'You will be clear from my oath' means that 
in that case no blame was attached to the natural man. The remainder of this section, as far as verse 48, is similar in meaning to a previous part of the chapter. </p>

Vers. 34-48.  Et dixit, Servus Abrahami ego. Et Jehovah benedixit domino meo valde, et magnificavit, et dedit ei gregem et armentum, et argentum et aurum, et servos et ancillas, et camelos et annos. 
Et peperit Sarah uxor domini mei filium domino meo post senectutem suam, et dedit illi omnia quae ei. Et adjuravit me dominus meus, dicendo, Non accipies mulierem filio meo e filiabus Canaanitae, cujus 
ego habito in terra. Non nisi ad domum patris mei ibis, et ad familiam meam, et accipies mulierem filio meo. Et dixi ad dominum meum, Forte non eat mulier post me. Et dixit ad me, Jehovah, Quo ambulavi 
coram, mittet angelum Suum cum te, et prosperabit viam tuam, et accipias mulierem filio meo, e familia mea, et e domo patris mei.  Tunc immunis eris ab obsecratione mea, quod veneris ad familiam 
meam, et si non dederint tibi, et eris immunis ab obsecratione mea. Et veni hodie ad fontem, et dixi, Jehovah Deus domini mei Abrahami, si sit Tibi quaeso prosperans viam queam, qua ego ambulans super. 
Ecce ego sto apud fontem aquarum, et sit adolescentula exiens ad hauriendum, et dico ad illam, Fac potare me quaeso parum aquae e cado tuo. Et dicat ad me, Etiam tu bibe, et etiam camelis tuis hauriam, 
illa mulier quam destinavit Jehovah filio domini mei. Ego vix absolvi loqui ad cor meum, et ecce Rebecca exit, et cadus ejus super humero ejus, et descendit ad fontem, et haurit, et dixi ad illam, 
Fac potare me quaeso. Et festinabat et demittebat cadum suum desuper se, et dicebat, Bibe, et etiam camelos tuos potabo; et bibi, et etiam camelos potavit. Et interrogabam illam, et dicebam, Filia cujus 
tu? et dixit, Filia Bethuelis filii Nahoris, quem peperit illi Milkah; et posui monile super nasum illius, et armillas super manus illius. Et inflexi et incurvavi me Jehovae, et benedixi Jehovae Deo 
domini mei Abrahami, Qui duxit me in viam veritatis ad accipiendum filiam fratris domini mei filio suo. `Dixit, Servus Abrahami ego' significat quod ex Divino Bono esset: `et Jehovah benedixit domino 
meo valde et magnificavit' significat Divinum Humanum quoad bonum et quoad verum: `et dedit ei gregem et armentum' significat bona in genere: `et argentum et aurum' significat vera in genere: `et servos 
et ancillas, et camelos et asinos' significat vera in specie: `et peperit Sarah uxor domini mei filium domino meo' significat Rationale Divinum ex Divino Vero: `post senectutem suam' significat 
cum status esset: et dedit illi omnia quae ei' significat quod Ipsi Divina omnia: `et adjuravit me dominus meus' significat, hic ut prius, obstrictionem et sacramentum: `dicendo, Non accipies mulierem 
filio meo e filiabus Canaanitae' significat, hic ut prius, quod Rationale Divinum non conjungeretur alicui affectioni quae cum vero discordat: `cujus ego habito in terra' significat discordantia in quibus 
Bonum Divinum est: `non nisi ad domum patris mei ibis' significat bonum quod ex Divino: `et ad familiam meam' significat verum quod ex Divino: `et accipies mulierem filio meo' significat quod inde 
conjunctio: `et dixi ad dominum meum, Forte non eat mulier post me' significat, hic ut prius, dubitationem naturalis hominis de affectione illa, num separabilis esset: `et dixit ad me' significat instructionem: 
`Jehovah, Quo ambulavi coram, mittet angelum Suum cum te' significat, hic ut prius, Divinam Providentiam: `et prosperabit viam tuam' significat quoad verum:  `et accipias mulierem filio 
meo' significat quod conjunctio: `e familia mea, et e domo patris mei' significat ex bono et vero quod ex Divino ibi: `tunc immunis eris ab obsecratione mea' significat, hic ut prius, liberum quod naturali 
homini: `quod veneris ad familiam meam, et si non dederint tibi' significat quoad separationem: `et eris immunis ab obsecratione mea' significat quod tunc nulla culpa naturali homini. Reliqua usque 
ad vers. 48, significant similia quae prius. </p>
