<h3 align="center" class="ired">属天的奥秘 第4723节</h3>
<h4 align="center"></h4><p><strong>4723.</strong>“他们远远地看见他”表远远所觉知到的主之神性人身。这从“看见”和“远远”的含义，以及“约瑟”的代表清楚可知：“看见”是指觉知（参看<a href="2150.htm">2150</a>，<a href="3764.htm">3764</a>节）；“远远”是指遥远；“约瑟”，就是他们远远所看见的那一位，是指神性真理方面的主（<a href="4669.htm">4669</a>节）。“约瑟”在此之所以表示主的神性人身，是因为主的神性人身是神性真理的至高面。有两个要素构成教会，因此教会有两个主要教义：其一，主的人身是神性；其二，构成教会的是对主之爱和对邻之仁，而不是与爱和仁分离之信。这些因是神性真理的主要方面，故也由“约瑟”来代表。凡代表神性真理的人一般也代表神性真理的具体方面。至于此处代表哪个具体方面，这从整个思路明显看出来。</p>

And they saw him afar off. That this signifies perception of the Lord's Divine Human remotely, is evident from the signification of "seeing," as being perception (see n. 2150, 3764); from the signification 
of "afar off," as being remotely; and from the representation of Joseph, who it was that they saw afar off, as being the Lord as to Divine truth (n. 4669). That it is the Lord's Divine Human which 
is here meant by "Joseph," is because this is the supreme of Divine truth. There are two essentials which constitute the church, and hence two principal things of doctrine - one, that the Lord's Human 
is Divine; the other, that love to the Lord and charity toward the neighbor make the church, and not faith separate from love and charity. Because these are the primary things of Divine truth, these 
also are represented by Joseph; for the same person that represents Divine truth in general, represents also the specific things of Divine truth; but what is specifically represented, is evident from 
the series. </p>

'They saw him from a distance' means the Lord's Divine Human perceived remotely. This is clear from the meaning of 'seeing' as perception, dealt with in <a href="2150.htm">2150</a>, <a href="3764.htm">3764</a>; from the meaning of 'from a distance' 
as remotely; and from the representation of 'Joseph' - the one they saw from a distance - as the Lord as regards Divine Truth, dealt with in <a href="4669.htm">4669</a>. The reason the Lord's Divine Human is what 'Joseph' 
is used to mean here is that His Divine Human is the highest aspect of Divine Truth. There are two essentials which constitute the Church and as a consequence it has two main teachings, the first being 
that the Lord's Human is Divine, the second that love to the Lord and charity towards the neighbour constitute the Church, not faith separated from these. Being the primary aspects of Divine Truth, 
these too are represented by 'Joseph'. Anyone who represents Divine Truth in general also represents the specific aspects of Divine Truth. But which specific aspect is represented at any point is evident 
from the train of thought. </p>

`Viderunt eum e longinquo': quod significet perceptionem Divini Humani Domini remote, constat a significatione `videre' quod sit perceptio, de qua n. 2150, 3764; ex significatione `e longinquo' quod 
sit remote; et ex repraesentatione `Josephi' qui est ille quem viderunt e longinquo {1} quod sit Dominus quoad Divinum Verum de qua n. 4669; quod sit Divinum Humanum Domini quod per `Josephum' 
hic intelligitur, est quia id est supremum Divini Veri sunt duo essentialia quae constituunt Ecclesiam, et inde duo principali doctrinae {2}, unum quod Humanum Domini sit Divinum, {3} alterum quod 
amor in Dominum (o)et charitas erga proximum faciant Ecclesiam non autem fides ab illis separata; haec quia sunt primaria Divini Veri, ideo etiam per `Josephum' illa repraesentantur; qui Divinum Verum 
in genere, etiam quae sunt Divini Veri in specie, repraesentat at quid in specie repraesentat, ex serie patet.      @1 perceperunt remote$      @2 i ejus$      @3 i et$ </p>
