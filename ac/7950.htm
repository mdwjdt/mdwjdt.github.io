<h3 align="center" class="ired">属天的奥秘 第7950节</h3>
<h4 align="center"></h4><p><strong>7950.</strong>“直到被关在坑牢里的囚犯的长子”表占据末位的被歪曲的信之真理。这从“埃及地的长子”和“被关在坑牢里的囚犯”的含义清楚可知：“埃及地的长子”是指与仁分离之信，如刚才所述（<a href="7948.htm">7948</a>节），因而也指被歪曲的信之真理，如下文所述；“被关在坑牢里的囚犯”是指那些占据末位的人，因为囚犯被放在了从“坐宝座的法老的长子”起的范畴内的另一边，“坐宝座的法老的长子”表示占据首位的被歪曲的信之真理（<a href="7779.htm">7779</a>，<a href="7949.htm">7949</a>节）。就最接近这些话本身的灵义而言，“坑牢里的囚犯”表示只在身体感官层面上进行思考，从而在真理和良善方面陷入纯粹幽暗的人；因为他甚至没有像那些在更内在的感官层面上进行思考的人那样的觉知能力。正因如此，所表示的是那些占据末位的人。<br />“埃及地的长子”之所以表示被歪曲的信之真理，是因为“埃及的长子”是指与仁分离之信（<a href="7948.htm">7948</a>节）；那些陷入这种信的人在信之真理方面陷入纯粹的黑暗和幽暗。他们不能处于任何光，因而根本不能觉知何为真理，以及它是不是真理。这是因为一切属灵之光皆从主经由良善，也就是经由仁爱而来。事实上，仁之良善就像发光的火焰；因为良善出于爱，而爱是属灵之火，是启示或光照的源头。凡以为过着邪恶生活的人也能在信之真理上接受启示的人都大错特错了。他们可处于这样的状态：他们能出示证据，也就是能证明他们教会的教义事物，有时做起这种事既巧妙又高超；然而，他们却看不到他们所证明的事是不是真的。虚假也能被如此巧妙地证明，以致它看似真理；人的智慧并不在于他能证明某件事是对的，而在于他能明白事情就是如此（参看<a href="4741.htm">4741</a>，<a href="5033.htm">5033</a>，<a href="6865.htm">6865</a>，<a href="7012.htm">7012</a>，<a href="7680.htm">7680</a>节）。<br />因此，在生活上陷入邪恶的人就会沉浸于他的邪恶所生的虚假中，不信真理，无论他多么了解真理。有时他以为自己信，但他错了。在来世，他将被允许知道，他其实并不信；那时，他的觉知会与他的意愿变得一致。到那时，他会否认、反对、唾弃真理，并承认它的对立面，即虚假为真理。这解释了为何那些陷入与仁分离之信的人只会歪曲信之真理。</p>

Unto the firstborn of the captive that was in the house of the pit. That this signifies the falsified truths of faith which are in the last place, is evident from the signification of "the firstborn 
in the land of Egypt," as being faith separate from charity (as just above, n. 7948), thus also the falsified truth of faith (of which in what follows); and from the signification of "the captive that 
was in the house of the pit," as being those who are in the last place, for the captive is contrasted with "the firstborn of Pharaoh about to sit upon the throne," whereby is signified the falsified 
truth of faith which is in the first place (n. 7779, 7949). In the proximate spiritual sense, by "the captive in the house of the pit," is meant one who is in the bodily sensuous, thus in mere thick darkness 
concerning truths and goods, because not even in the faculty of perceiving, as are they who are in the interior sensuous; hence it is that they are signified who are in the last place.  [2] That 
"the firstborn in the land of Egypt" denotes the falsified truth of faith, is because "the firstborn of Egypt" denotes faith separate from charity (n. 7948). They who are in this faith are in mere 
darkness and thick darkness with respect to the truths of faith; for they cannot be in any light, thus not in any perception of what truth is, and whether it is truth. For all spiritual light comes through 
good from the Lord, thus through charity, for the good of charity is like a flame from which is light; for good is of love, and love is spiritual fire, from which comes enlightenment. He who believes 
that they who are in evil can also be in enlightenment in respect to the truths of faith, is very much mistaken. They can be in a state of confirmation, that is, they may be able to confirm the 
doctrinal things of their church, and this sometimes with skill and ingenuity; but they cannot see whether what they confirm is true or not. (That falsity also can be confirmed even so as to appear like 
truth; and that it is not the part of a wise man to confirm, but to see whether the thing is so, see n. 4741, 5033, 6865, 7012, 7680.) [3] He therefore who is in evil as to life is in the falsity 
of his evil, and does not believe the truth, however well he knows it. He sometimes supposes that he believes, but he is mistaken. That he does not believe will be granted him to know in the other life, 
when his perceiving is reduced into agreement with his willing. Then he will disown, hold in aversion, and reject the truth, and will acknowledge as truth that which is contrary, that is, falsity. 
Hence then it is that they who are in faith separate from charity cannot do otherwise than falsify the truths of faith. </p>

'Even to the firstborn of the prisoner who was in the dungeon' means falsified truths of faith that occupy the last place of all. This is clear from the meaning of 'the firstborn in the land of Egypt' 
as faith separated from charity, as just above in <a href="7948.htm">7948</a>, and so also falsified truth of faith, dealt with below; and from the meaning of 'the prisoner who is in the dungeon' as those who occupy the last 
place of all, for his firstborn is placed at the opposite end of the scale from 'Pharaoh's firstborn who was to sit on his throne', which means falsified truth of faith that occupies the first place, <a href="7779.htm">7779</a>, <a href="7949.htm">7949</a>. 'The prisoner who is in the dungeon' is used to mean in the spiritual sense closest to the actual words one who thinks only on the level of his physical senses, and so is in utterly thick 
darkness so far as matters of truth and good are concerned; for he does not even possess the ability to perceive, as those who think on a more internal level of the senses do. This is the reason why 
those who occupy the last place of all are meant. </p>
<p></p>
<p><b>[2]</b>
 The reason why 'the firstborn in the land of Egypt' means falsified truth of faith is that 'the firstborn of Egypt' is faith separated from 
charity, <a href="7948.htm">7948</a>; and those with this kind of faith are in nothing but complete and utter darkness so far as truths of faith are concerned. They cannot be in any light, and so cannot at all perceive what 
truth is or whether something is true. This is because all spiritual light comes from the Lord through good, that is, through charity. For the good of charity is like a flame from which light radiates, 
since good comes of love, and love is spiritual fire, the source of enlightenment. Anyone who imagines that people leading an evil life can also receive enlightenment in the truths of faith is very 
much mistaken. Their state may be such that they are able to produce proofs, that is, they may be able to prove the teachings of their Church, sometimes with skill and ingenuity; yet they are not able 
to see whether the things they prove are true or not. The fact that even falsity can be proved so adroitly that it seems to be the truth, and that a person is wise not when he can prove that something 
is right but when he can see whether it is, see <a href="4741.htm">4741</a>, <a href="5033.htm">5033</a>, <a href="6865.htm">6865</a>, <a href="7011.htm">7011</a>, <a href="7680.htm">7680</a>. </p>
<p></p>
<p><b>[3]</b>
 Therefore a person whose life is sunk in evil is steeped in falsity arising from his evil; and no matter how well 
he knows what is true he does not believe it. Sometimes he thinks he does, but he is mistaken. He will be allowed to know in the next life that he does not believe it, when his perceiving is made to 
conform to his desiring. When that is done he will disown the truth, oppose it, and spurn it, and will acknowledge its opposite - falsity - as the truth. This now explains why those who are governed 
by faith separated from charity cannot help falsifying the truths of faith. </p>

`Usque ad primogenitum captivi qui in domo foveae': quod significet vera falsificata fidei quae postremo loco, constat ex significatione `primogeniti in terra Aegypti' quod sit fides separata a charitate, 
ut mox supra n. 7948, ita quoque verum fidei falsificatum, de quo sequitur; et ex significatione `captivi qui in domo foveae' quod sint qui postremo loco, opponitur enim {1} `primogenito Pharaonis 
sessuro super throno illius,' per quod significatur verum fidei falsificatum quod primo loco, n. 7779, 7949; per `captivum in domo foveae' in spirituali sensu proximo intelligitur qui in sensuali 
corporeo est, ita in mera caligine de veris et bonis, quia ne quidem in facultate percipiendi, sicut qui in sensuali interiore sunt; inde est quod significentur qui in postremo loco sunt. 	2 Quod `primogenitum 
in terra Aegypti' sit verum fidei falsificatum, est quia `primogenitum Aegypti' est fides separata a charitate, n. 7948; qui in hac fide sunt in mero tenebroso et caliginoso sunt de veris quae 
fidei, in nulla enim luce possunt esse, ita non in aliqua perceptione quid verum et num verum; omnis enim lux spiritualis venit per bonum a Domino, ita per charitatem, nam bonum charitatis est sicut 
flamma ex qua lux; bonum enim est amoris, et amor est ignis spiritualis, ex quo illustratio; qui credit quod qui in malo vitae sunt etiam in illustratione quoad vera fidei possint esse, maximopere 
fallitur; possunt in statu confirmationis esse, hoc est, (x)possunt confirmare doctrinalia Ecclesiae suae, et hoc quandoque {2}sollerter et ingeniose, sed non possunt videre num quae confirmant sint vera 
vel non; quod confirmari queat etiam falsum usque (x)ut appareat sicut verum; et quod non sapientis sit confirmare sed videre num {3}ita sit, videatur n. 4741, 5033, (x)6865, 7012, 7680. 	3 Qui itaque 
in malo quoad vitam est, is in falso sui mali est, et verum, utcumque scit illud, non credit; quandoque putat se credere sed fallitur; quod non credat, dabitur ei scire in altera vita quando percipere 
ejus redigitur ad concors cum velle ejus, tunc verum inficiabitur, aversabitur, et respuet, et quod contrarium est, hoc est, falsum agnoscet pro vero; {4} inde nunc est quod qui in fide separata 
a charitate sunt non possint {5}aliter quam vera quae fidei falsificare {6}. 	@1 i primogenitum ejus$ 	@2 dextre$ 	@3 d ita sit i verum sit$ 	@4 i et$ 	@5 non$ 	@6 i qui in scientia fidei et in 
vita mali intra Ecclesiam sunt non possunt credere, quod apud se falsificent vera, sed quod ita sit, scient in altera vita$ </p>
