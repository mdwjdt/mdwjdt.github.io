<h3 align="center" class="ired">属天的奥秘 第9095节</h3>
<h4 align="center"></h4><p><strong>9095.</strong>“人若知道这牛素来习惯用角抵触人”表如果以前就知道它的情感是这样的。这从“知道”或已被证明和“这牛素来习惯用角抵触人”的含义清楚可知：“知道”或已被证明是指已经进入理解力（参看<a href="9071.htm">9071</a>节），因为凡从意愿进入理解力的，都是已知的；“这牛素来习惯用角抵触人”是指这情感以前就是这样的，如前所述（<a href="9070.htm">9070</a>节），</p>

Or if it be known that the ox was wont to strike with the horn from yesterday the day before yesterday. That this signifies if it had previously been known that such was its affection, is evident from 
the signification of "to be known," or "attested," as being that it had passed into the intellectual (see n. 9071), for that which has passed there from the will has become known; and from the signification 
of "that the ox was wont to strike with the horn from yesterday the day before yesterday," as being that such had been the affection heretofore (as also above, n. 9070). </p>

'Or if it is known that the ox has been accustomed to gore in the past' means [if] it has been known previously that [its] affection is such. This is clear from the meaning of 'being known', or having 
been testified, as having passed into the understanding, as above in <a href="9071.htm">9071</a>, for what passes into it from the will is that which becomes known; and from the meaning of 'that the ox has been accustomed 
to gore in the past' as that the affection has previously been such, also as above, in <a href="9070.htm">9070</a>. </p>

`Vel notum quod bos cornupeta ille ab heri nudius tertius': quod significet [si] notum prius quod talis affectio [ejus] fuerit, constat ex significatione `notum' seu {1} testatum esse, quod sit transivisse 
in intellectuale, ut supra n. 9071, (o)nam quod illuc ex voluntario transit, id fit notum; et ex significatione `quod bos cornupeta (o)fuerit ab heri nudius tertius' quod sit quod talis affectio
