<h3 align="center" class="ired">属天的奥秘 第10399节</h3>
<h4 align="center"></h4><p><strong>10399</strong>.“起来！为我们造神明，可以走在我们前头”表制造教义和敬拜的虚假，因而制造偶像崇拜的东西。这从“神明”和“可以走在我们前头”的含义清楚可知：“神明”是指真理（对此，参看<a href="4295.htm">4295</a>，<a href="4402.htm">4402</a>，<a href="7010.htm">7010</a>，<a href="7268.htm">7268</a>，<a href="7873.htm">7873</a>，<a href="8301.htm">8301</a>节），在反面意义上是指虚假（<a href="4402.htm">4402</a>e，<a href="4544.htm">4544</a>，<a href="7873.htm">7873</a>节），因此，“制造神明”表示制造教义的虚假，或由虚假构成的教义；“可以走在我们前头”是指他们可以跟从虚假，因而照着它们建立自己的敬拜。“造神明，可以走在我们前头”表示制造偶像崇拜的东西，这是显而易见的。此外，偶像崇拜就在于敬拜与内在之物分离的外在事物（参看<a href="4825.htm">4825</a>，<a href="9424.htm">9424</a>节）。此处有必要用几句话来说一说这种偶像崇拜。要建立在以色列民族当中的教会的外在就在于摩西在西乃山上时，主吩咐他制造的一切事物。这些事物包括：会幕和会幕内的法柜，法柜上的施恩座，摆放脸饼或陈设饼的桌子，灯台，香坛，以及燔祭坛，亚伦和他儿子的衣服，尤其以弗得和它上面的胸牌。此外还有膏油，香，燔祭和祭牲的血，奠祭的酒，坛上的火，以及其它更多事物。以色列和犹太民族将这一切事物都当作圣物来敬拜，却不敬拜它们所代表的神圣。他们根本不思想主、天堂、爱、信、重生，因而不思想这些事物所表示的真实事物。由于他们的敬拜具有这样的性质，所以这是对木块、饼、酒、血、油、火和衣服的敬拜，而不是对这些物体里面的主的敬拜。他们所执行的这种敬拜不是神性敬拜，而是偶像崇拜，这是显而易见的。</p>

Rise, make us gods which shall go before us. That this signifies falsities of doctrine and of worship, thus things idolatrous, is evident from the signification of "gods," as being truths (on which see 
n. 4295, 4402, 7010, 7268, 7873, 8301), and in the opposite sense falsities (n. 4402 end, 4544, 7873), consequently "to make gods" denotes to make falsities of doctrine, or doctrine from falsities; 
and from the signification of "which shall go before us," as being which they may follow, thus according to which they may institute worship. That "to make gods which shall go before us" denotes idolatrous 
things, is evident. Moreover, it is idolatrous to worship external things separate from internal ones (see n. 4825, 9424). Concerning this kind of idolatry a few words shall here be said. The externals 
of the church that was to be instituted with the Israelitish nation were all those things which were commanded Moses by the Lord on Mount Sinai, which were the Tent of meeting with the ark therein, 
the propitiatory over it, the table upon which were the breads of faces, the lampstand, the altar of incense, likewise the altar of burnt offering, the garments of Aaron and of his sons, especially 
the ephod upon which was the breast plate, besides also the oil of anointing, the incense, the blood of the burnt-offering and of the sacrifice, the wine for a drink-offering, the fire upon the altar, 
besides many other things. The Israelitish and Jewish nation worshiped all these things as holy, without the holy which they represented, and thought nothing whatever about the Lord, about heaven, 
about love, about faith, about regeneration, thus about those things which were signified. As their worship was of such a nature, it was a worship of wood, of bread, of wine, of blood, of oil, of fire, 
of garments, but not of the Lord in these. That relatively to these things such worship is not Divine worship, but idolatrous, is manifest. </p>

'Rise, make [us] gods to go before us' means producing falsities that figure in religious teachings and worship, thus producing things of an idolatrous nature. This is clear from the meaning of 'gods' 
as truths, dealt with in <a href="4295.htm">4295</a>, <a href="4402.htm">4402</a>, <a href="7010.htm">7010</a>, <a href="7268.htm">7268</a>, <a href="7873.htm">7873</a>, <a href="8301.htm">8301</a>, and in the contrary sense as falsities, <a href="4402.htm">4402</a>(end), <a href="4544.htm">4544</a>, <a href="7873.htm">7873</a>, so that 'making gods' means producing falsities that figure in religious teachings, 
or teachings composed of falsities; and from the meaning of 'to go before us' as falsities for them to follow, thus falsities according to which they may establish their worship. The fact that 
'making gods to go before us' means producing things of an idolatrous nature is self-evident. Idolatry furthermore consists in worshipping external things devoid of internal ones, see <a href="4825.htm">4825</a>, <a href="9424.htm">9424</a>. But 
something brief must be stated here regarding this kind of idolatry. The externals of the Church to be established among the Israelite nation consisted of all those things the Lord told Moses to make, 
when he was on Mount Sinai. These were the tent of meeting together with the ark there, the mercy-seat above it, the table on which the loaves of the Presence were laid, the lampstand, the altar of 
incense, also the altar of burnt offering, and the garments of Aaron and his sons, in particular the ephod with the breastplate over it. In addition, the anointing oil, the incense, the blood of burnt 
offerings and of sacrifices, the wine for drink-offerings, the fire on the altar, and much more besides. The Israelite and Jewish nation venerated all these elements as things that were holy, yet without 
any respect for the holiness they represented. They had no thought at all of the Lord, heaven, love, faith, regeneration, nor thus of the realities meant by those elements. Since their worship 
was like this it was a worship of pieces of wood, loaves of bread, wine, blood, oil, fire, and garments, but not of the Lord within those objects. That worship as practised by them is not Divine but idolatrous 
worship, as is self-evident.  </p>

`Surge, fac [nobis] deos, qui eant ante nos': quod significet falsa doctrinae ac cultus, ita idololatrica, constat ex significatione `deorum' quod sint vera, de qua n. 4295, 4402, 7010, 7268, 7873, 
8301, ac in opposito sensu falsa, n. 4402 fin., 4544, 7873; inde `facere deos' est falsa doctrinae, seu doctrinam ex falsis; et ex significatione `ire ante {1}nos' quod sit quae sequantur, ita secundum 
quae cultum instituant; {2}quod `facere deos qui eant ante nos' sint idololatrica, patet; etiam idololatricum est colere externa absque internis, videatur n. 4825, (x)9424. De hoc genere idololatriae 
hic paucis dicetur: externa Ecclesiae apud gentem Israeliticam instituendae erant omnia illa quae a Domino Moschi mandata sunt in monte Sinai, quae erant tentorium conventus cum arca ibi, propitiatorium 
super illa, mensa super qua panes facierum, candelabrum, altare suffitus, {3} tum altare holocausti, vestes Aharonis et filiorum ejus, imprimis ephodum super quo pectorale; praeterea etiam oleum 
unctionis, suffimentum, sanguis holocausti et sacrificii, {4}vinum pro libamine, ignis super altari, praeter plura alia gens Israelitica et Judaica colebat illa omnia ut sancta, absque sancto quod repraesentabant, 
{5}et prorsus nihil cogitabant de Domino, de caelo, de amore, de fide, de regeneratione, ita de illis quae significabantur; cum talis illis cultus erat, tunc cultus {6} lignorum, panum, 
vini: sanguinis, olei, ignis, vestium erat, non autem Domini in illis; quod ille cultus respective ad illos non sit cultus Divinus sed idololatricus, patet. @1 eos$ @2 quod sint idololatrica, est quia
