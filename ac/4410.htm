<h3 align="center" class="ired">属天的奥秘 第4410节</h3>
<h4 align="center"></h4><p><strong>4410.</strong>大量经历清楚向我表明：左眼的视觉对应于属理解力的真理，右眼对应于也属理解力的对真理的情感；因此，左眼对应于信之真理，右眼对应于信之良善。之所以存在这种对应关系，是因为出自主的光不仅是光，也是热；光本身是从主发出的真理，热则是良善。这一切连同进入两个脑半球的流注，就是这种对应关系的起源；因为那些处于良善的人在主的右边，而那些处于真理的人则在主的左边。</p>

<p align="center"><b>Potts(1905-1910) 4410</b></p><p><b>4410.</b>
It has become evident to me from much experience that the sight of the left eye corresponds to truths which are of the understanding, and the right eye to affections of truth, which are also of the understanding; 
and consequently that the left eye corresponds to the truths of faith, and the right eye to the goods of faith. The reason why there is such a correspondence is that in the light which is 
from the Lord there is not only light, but also heat, the light itself being the truth which proceeds from the Lord, and the heat being the good. It is from this, and also from the influx into the two 
hemispheres of the brain, that there exists such a correspondence; for those who are in good are on the Lord's right hand, and those who are in truth are on His left hand. </p>

Much experience has made it plain to me that the sight of the left eye corresponds to the truths seen by the understanding and the right eye to the affections for truth which are also present with the 
understanding; and therefore that the left eye corresponds to the truths of faith and the right eye to the goods of faith. The reason why such correspondence exists is that the light which comes from 
the Lord is heat as well as light, the light itself being the truth which proceeds from the Lord and the heat the good. This, together with influx into the two hemispheres of the brain, is the origin 
of that correspondence; for those who are governed by good are on the Lord's right, and those governed by truth on His left. </p>

</p><b>4410.</b>
Per multam experientiam mihi patefactum est quod visus oculi sinistri correspondeat veris quae intellectus, et oculus dexter affectionibus veri quae quoque sunt intellectus; proinde quod oculus sinister 
correspondeat veris fidei, et oculus dexter bonis fidei.  Quod talis correspondentia sit, est quia in luce quae a Domino, non modo est {1} lux sed etiam calor, ipsa lux est verum quod procedit 
a Domino et calor est bonum; inde et quoque ex influxu in bina hemisphaeria cerebri est correspondentia talis; nam qui in bono sunt, ad dextrum Domini sunt, et {2} qui in vero ad sinistrum.
