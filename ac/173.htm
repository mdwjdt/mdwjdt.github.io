<h3 align="center" class="ired">属天的奥秘 第173节</h3>
<h4 align="center"></h4><p><strong>173.</strong>坐在我头部的天使一直默默无声，只是通过面部交流思想。这样，我觉得好似有另一张脸映在我脸上，事实上，应该是两张脸，因为有两位天使。当天使发觉他们的脸被接收了，就知道那人已经死了。</p>

<p><strong>[NCE]173.</strong> The angels sitting at my head were completely silent, communicating their thoughts only by the face, so that I felt something like a new face come over me — two new faces, in fact, since there were two angels.<br />When the angels perceive that their faces are being mirrored, they know the person is dead. </p>
<p align="center"><b>Potts(1905-1910) 173</b></p><p><b>173.</b>
The angels who sat at my head were perfectly silent, merely communicating their thoughts by the face, so that I could perceive that another face was as it were induced upon me; indeed two, because there 
were two angels. When the angels perceive that their faces are received, they know that the man is dead. </p>

<p align="center"><b>Elliott(1983-1999) 173</b></p><p><b>173.</b>
The angels sitting at my head were completely silent, communicating their thoughts by facial expressions only. From this I perceived that a different face was as it were superimposed over my own, two 
faces in fact, since there were two angels. When the angels perceive that their own faces are being received they know that the person has died.  </p>

<p align="center"><b>Latin(1748-1756) 173</b>
</p><b>173.</b>
Angeli qui assidebant capiti, tacitissimi erant, modo communicantes sua cogitata cum facie; sic ut perciperem quod mihi quasi inducta sit alia facies, et quidem bina, quia bini erant. Angeli, cum percipiunt 
quod eorum facies recipiantur, tunc noscunt quod homo mortuus sit. </p>
