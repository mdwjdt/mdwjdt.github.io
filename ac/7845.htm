Verses 7-11. And they shall take of the blood, and put it upon the two posts and upon the lintel, upon the houses in which they shall eat it. And they shall eat the flesh in that night, roast with fire, 
and things unleavened; upon things bitter they shall eat it. Eat ye not of it raw, and by boiling boiled in waters, but roast with fire; its head upon its legs and upon its midst. And ye shall not 
leave of it until the morning; and that which is left of it until the morning ye shall burn with fire. And thus shall ye eat it: your loins girded, your shoes on your feet, and your staff in your hand; 
and ye shall eat it in haste; this is the passover of Jehovah. "And they shall take of the blood," signifies the holy truth which is of the good of innocence; "and shall put it upon the two posts and 
upon the lintel," signifies the truths and the goods of the natural; "upon the houses," signifies those things which are of the will of good; "in which they shall eat it," signifies enjoyment; "and 
they shall eat the flesh," signifies the enjoyment of good; "in that night," signifies along with the damnation of the evil; "roast with fire," signifies the good which is of love; "and things unleavened," 
signifies purified from all falsity; "upon things bitter," signifies by means of the undelightful things of temptations; "they shall eat it," signifies enjoyment; "eat ye not of it raw," signifies 
that it shall not be without love; "and by boiling boiled in waters," signifies that it shall not go forth from truth; "but roast with fire," signifies that it shall go forth from love; "its head 
upon its legs and upon its midst," signifies from the inmost to the external; "and ye shall not leave of it until the morning," signifies the duration of this state before a state of enlightenment in 
heaven; "and that which is left of it until the morning ye shall burn with fire," signifies a state of the means for the end through temptations; "and thus shall ye eat it," signifies enjoyment in a state 
of separation from the evil who had infested, and preservation then; "your loins girded," signifies in respect to the interiors; "your shoes on your feet," signifies in respect to the exteriors; 
"and your staff in your hand," signifies in respect to the intermediates; "and ye shall eat it in haste," signifies the affection of separation; "this is the passover of Jehovah," signifies the presence 
of the Lord and liberation by Him. </p>

Verses 7-11 And they shall take some of the blood and put it onto the two doorposts and onto the lintel, on the houses in which they will eat it. And they shall eat the flesh on that night; roasted with 
fire, and [with] unleavened bread on bitter herbs, they shall eat it. Do not eat any of it raw, nor boiled at all in water, but roasted indeed with fire, its head over its legs and over its middle. 
And you shall not leave any of it until the morning; and what does remain of it until the morning you shall burn with fire. And thus you shall eat it: Your loins girded, your shoes on your feet, and 
your rod in your hand. And you shall eat it in haste; it is a Passover to Jehovah. </p>
