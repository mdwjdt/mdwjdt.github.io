<h3 align="center" class="ired">属天的奥秘 第3769节</h3>
<h4 align="center"></h4><p><strong>3769.</strong>“井口上有一块大石头”表它，即圣言，被封住了。这是显而易见的，无需解释。当只照着字义理解圣言，并且字义中的一切事物都被视为教义时，可以说圣言被封住了。当这些事物作为支持自我之爱和尘世之爱欲望而被认可时，圣言被封得更严实，因数尤其这些东西把大石头滚到井口上，也就是封住圣言。在这种情况下，人们既不知道，也不想知道圣言里面存在什么内层意义。然而，他们能从许多以内义解释字义的经文，以及在教会中被广泛接受的、通过各种解释指向字义的教义事物明白，圣言具有内层意义。<br />圣言被封住的意思从犹太人看得尤其清楚。他们照字面解释每一个事物，并因此相信他们优先于世上所有民族和人民被拣选，还相信弥赛亚会来领他们进入迦南地，将他们高举在世上所有民族和人民之上。因为犹太人沉浸于世俗和肉体的爱欲中，而世俗和肉体的爱欲具有这样的性质，它们会完全封闭圣言。而且，他们竟然不知道天国是否存在，他们死后是否还会活着，不知道何为内在人，甚至不知道任何属灵事物的存在，更不知道弥赛亚来拯救灵魂。对他们来说，圣言被封住了。这一点从以下事实很清楚地看出来，他们虽生活在基督徒当中，却丝毫不接受他们的教义事物，和以赛亚书所说的一样：<br />你去对这百姓说，你们听是要听见，却不明白；看是要看见，却不理解。要使这百姓心蒙脂油，耳朵发沉，眼睛昏迷。我就说，主啊！这到几时为止呢？祂说，直到城邑荒凉，无人居住，房屋空闲无人，地土废弃荒凉。（以赛亚书<a href="http://39-27.cn/赛6.9.htm">6:9</a>-<a href="http://39-27.cn/赛6.11.htm">11</a>；马太福音<a href="http://39-27.cn/太13.14.htm">13:14</a>-<a href="http://39-27.cn/太13.15.htm">15</a>；约翰福音<a href="http://39-27.cn/约12.40.htm">12:40</a>-<a href="http://39-27.cn/约12.41.htm">41</a>）<br />人越沉浸于自我和尘世之爱以及伴随这些爱的欲望中，圣言就越向他封闭。因为这些爱以自我为目的，这目的点燃属世之光，却熄灭天堂之光，以致人们清楚看到属于自我和尘世的事物，却根本看不到属于主及其国度的任何事物。当出现这种情况时，他们的确能阅读圣言，但却带有获取地位和财富的目的，或为了做给别人看，或因为这是符合社会习俗的事，因而仅仅是惯性使然，或出于一种宗教义务，然而没有以修正生活为目的。对这类人来说，圣言以种种方式被封闭，对有些人甚至封闭到除了他们的教义事物所指示的东西（无论这些东西是什么）外，他们什么也不愿知道。例如，若有人说，打开和关闭天堂的权柄从来没有被赐给彼得，而是被赋予根植于爱的信，这信由彼得的钥匙来表示，由于自我之爱和尘世之爱的反对，他们决不会承认。若有人说，不可敬拜圣徒，唯独敬拜主，他们也不会接受。或者若有人说，圣餐中的饼和酒表示主对全人类的爱，以及反过来人对主的爱，他们不相信。又或者若有人声称信除非是信之善，也就是仁爱，否则一点用处没有，他们给出完全相反的解释；其它一切事物也一样。像这样的人一点也看不到圣言中的真理，也不愿看到。相反，他们顽固坚守自己的信条，甚至不愿听到内义的存在，并且圣言的神圣和荣耀就在这内义中。事实上，当听到内义的存在时，他们由于一提到它就厌恶而抗拒。圣言就这样被封闭了。然而，圣言具有这样的性质，它直接向天堂敞开，并经由天堂向主敞开；唯独涉及人时，也就是说，只要他在生活的目的上受制于自我之爱和尘世之爱的邪恶，并由于这些邪恶而受制于虚假的原则，圣言就被封闭。由此可见“井口上的大石头”是什么意思。</p>

And a great stone was upon the well's mouth. That this signifies that the Word was closed, is evident without explication. The Word is said to be closed when it is understood solely as to the sense of 
the letter, and when all that is in this sense is taken for doctrine. And it is still more closed when those things are acknowledged as doctrinal things which favor the cupidities of the love of self 
and of the world; for these especially roll a great stone upon the mouth of the well, that is, close up the Word; and then mankind do not know, neither do they desire to know, that there is any interior 
sense in the Word, when yet they may see this from many passages where the sense of the letter is unfolded as to the interior sense; and also from the doctrinal things received in the church, to 
which by various explications they refer all the sense of the letter of the Word.  [2] What is meant by the Word being closed may be seen especially from the Jews, who explain each and all things according 
to the letter, and thence believe that they are chosen in preference to all nations on the face of the earth, and that the Messiah will come to bring them into the land of Canaan and exalt them 
above all nations and peoples of the earth; for they are immersed in earthly corporeal loves, which are such that they altogether close up the Word as to interior things. Therefore also they do not yet 
know whether there is any heavenly kingdom, whether they shall live after death, what the internal man is, nor even that there is anything spiritual; still less do they know that the Messiah has come 
to save souls. That the Word is closed with them, may be sufficiently evident also from the fact that although they live among Christians, they do not receive the least of their doctrinal things-according 
to the following words in Isaiah: </p>
<p>     Say to this people, Hearing, hear ye, and do not understand; and seeing, see ye, and do not perceive. Make the heart of this people fat, and their ears 
heavy, and blind their eyes. And I said, Lord, how long? And He said, Until the cities be waste without inhabitant, and the houses without man, and the ground be wasted to a solitude (Isa. 6:9-11; Matt. 
13:14-15; John 12:40-41). [3] For insofar as a man is immersed in loves of self and of the world, and in the cupidities of these loves, so far the Word is closed to him; for these loves have self 
as their end, which end kindles a natural lumen, but extinguishes heavenly light, so that men sharply see the things of self and the world, but not at all those of the Lord and His kingdom; and when this 
is the case, they may indeed read the Word, but it is with the end of acquiring honors and riches, or for the sake of appearance, or from the love and consequent habit of it, or from piety, and yet 
not from a purpose of amending the life. To such persons the Word is in various ways closed; to some so much that by no means are they willing to know anything but what their doctrinal things dictate, 
whatever these may be.  [4] For example: should anyone say that the power of opening and shutting heaven was not given to Peter, but to the faith of love, which faith is signified by Peter's keys, 
inasmuch as the love of self and of the world opposes this, they will by no means acknowledge it. And should anyone say that saints ought not to be worshiped, but the Lord alone, neither do they receive 
this. Or if anyone should say that by the bread and wine in the Holy Supper is meant the Lord's love toward the universal human race, and the reciprocal love of man to the Lord, this they do not believe. 
Or should anyone assert that faith is of no avail unless it is the good of faith, that is, charity, this they explain inversely; and so with everything else. They who are of this character cannot 
see one whit of the truth that is in the Word, nor are they willing to see it, but abide obstinately in their own dogma; and are not even willing to hear that there is an internal sense wherein is 
the sanctity and glory of the Word, and even when they are told that it is so, from their aversion thereto they loathe the bare mention of it. Thus has the Word been closed, when yet it is of such a 
nature as to lie open even into heaven, and through heaven to the Lord, and it is closed solely in relation to man, insofar as he is in the evils of the love of self and of the world in respect to his 
ends of life, and in the consequent principles of falsity. From this it is evident what is signified by a great stone being upon the well's mouth. </p>

<p align="center"><b>Elliott(1983-1999) 3769</b></p><p><b>3769.</b>
'And there was a large stone over the mouth of the well' means that it, that is to say, the Word, was closed up. This becomes clear without explanation. The Word is said to be closed up when it is understood 
purely according to the sense of the letter and everything there is taken for doctrine. It is even more closed up when those things are acknowledged as doctrine which show favour to the desires 
that go with self-love and love of the world, for these especially roll the large stone over the mouth of the well, that is, they close the Word up. In this case people neither know nor wish to know 
that any interior sense exists within the Word. Yet they can see that the Word has an interior sense from the many places where the interior sense is used to explain the literal, and also from the generally 
accepted teachings within the Church which, by means of various explanations, are brought to bear on the literal sense. </p>
<p></p>
<p><b>[2]</b>
 What is meant by the Word's being closed up becomes particularly 
clear from the Jews who explain every single thing literally, and as a consequence believe that they have been chosen in preference to everybody else in all the world, and that the Messiah is coming 
who will lead them into the land of Canaan and will exalt them above all nations and peoples of the world. For the Jews are governed by loves of an earthly and bodily nature, which are such that they 
close the Word altogether so far as interior teachings are concerned. What is more, they do not even know whether any heavenly kingdom exists, whether they are going to live after death, what the internal 
man is, or even the existence of anything spiritual, let alone that the Messiah has come to save souls. The fact that the Word is in their case closed up may also be seen quite clearly from the consideration 
that although they live among Christians they nevertheless accept nothing whatever of Christian teaching, in accordance with the following words in Isaiah, </p>
<blockquote>
Say to this people, Hearing 
hear, and do not understand; and seeing see, and do not comprehend. Make the hearts of this people fat and their ears heavy, and plaster over their eyes. And I said, How long, O Lord? And He said, Until 
cities have been laid waste till no inhabitant [is left], and houses till no man [is left], and the land has been laid waste as a desolation. <a href="http://bible.gospelcom.net/cgi-bin/bible?passage=Isa%206:9-11&amp;version=ESV&amp;interface=print&amp;showfn=yes&amp;showxref">Isa 6:9-11</a>; <a href="http://bible.gospelcom.net/cgi-bin/bible?passage=Matt%2013:14,%2015&amp;version=ESV&amp;interface=print&amp;showfn=yes&amp;showxref">Matt 13:14, 15</a>; <a href="http://bible.gospelcom.net/cgi-bin/bible?passage=John%2012:40,%2041&amp;version=ESV&amp;interface=print&amp;showfn=yes&amp;showxref">John 12:40, 41</a>.

<p><b>[3]</b>
 To 
the extent that someone is under the influence of self-love and love of the world, and of the desires that go with these loves, the Word is to him closed up. For those loves have self as the end in view, 
an end which fosters natural light but extinguishes heavenly light. As a result people see clearly the things that belong to self and the world but nothing whatever of those that belong to the Lord 
and to His kingdom. When this is so they may indeed read the Word, but their end in view is the increase of personal position and wealth, or that they may be seen by others; or else they read it because 
it is the done thing and therefore merely from force of habit, or they read it as a religious duty, but without any amendment of life in view. To these people the Word has in different ways become 
closed up, for some so closed that they do not wish to know anything at all apart from that which their own teachings - whatever these may be - declare. </p>
<p></p>
<p><b>[4]</b>
 If anyone were to say, for example, that 
the power of opening and of shutting heaven has not been granted to Peter but to faith rooted in love, which faith is meant by Peter's keys, they would never acknowledge it because self-love and love 
of the world stand in the way. Or if anyone were to say that the saints ought not to be worshipped but the Lord alone, they would not accept that either. Nor would they believe it if someone were 
to say that the bread and wine in the Holy Supper mean the Lord's love towards the whole human race and man's love for the Lord in return. And if anyone were to say that faith - other than the good of 
faith, which is charity - does not achieve anything, they would give a completely contrary explanation. And so it would be with everything else. People like these can see nothing at all of the truth 
contained in the Word and do not wish to see it. Instead they adhere rigidly to their own doctrinal opinions. They do not even wish to hear of the existence of the internal sense in which the holiness 
and the glory of the Word reside. Indeed when they hear about the existence of it they are revolted because of their detestation of the mere mention of it. So the Word has been closed up. Yet the Word 
is such that it is open right into heaven, and through heaven towards the Lord, and is closed only in relation to man, that is, insofar as he is subject to the evils of self-love and love of the world 
where the ends in view of his life are concerned, and is subject to false assumptions resulting from those evils. From this one may see what is meant by 'a large stone over the mouth of the well'. </p>

`Et lapis magnus super ore putei': quod significet quod occlusum esset, nempe Verbum, constare potest absque explicatione.  Verbum occlusum dicitur dum solum quoad sensum litterae intelligitur, et 
omne id pro doctrinali assumitur quod ibi; et adhuc magis occlusum, cum illa pro doctrinalibus agnoscuntur quae favent cupiditatibus amoris sui et mundi, nam haec imprimis lapidem magnum super {1} 
os putei advolvunt, hoc est, occludunt Verbum; et tunc sicut non {2} sciunt, nec scire volunt, quod sensus aliquis interior in Verbo sit; cum tamen videre hoc possunt a pluribus locis ubi sensus 
litterae quoad interiorem sensum explicatur; et quoque ex doctrinalibus in Ecclesia receptis, ad quae omnem sensum litterae Verbi per explicationes varias referunt; [2] quid sit quod occlusum sit Verbum, 
constare (o)imprimis potest a Judaeis, qui omnia et singula explicant secundum litteram, et inde credunt quod (x)illi prae omnibus in universo terrarum orbe electi sint, et quod Messias venturus 
qui introducet eos in terram Canaanem, et illos supra omnes gentes et populos terrarum evehet; sunt enim in terrestribus corporeis {3} amoribus, qui tales sunt ut prorsus occludant Verbum quoad 
interiora; ideo etiam nondum sciunt an aliquod regnum caeleste sit, an victuri post mortem, quid internus homo, ne quidem quod detur aliquod {4} spirituale; minus quod Messias venerit ad salvandum 
animas; quod Verbum pro illis occlusum sit, satis constare potest etiam ex eo quod tametsi inter Christianos vivunt, usque tamen ne hilum ex doctrinalibus corum recipiant; secundum haec {5} apud 
Esaiam,           Dicas populo huic, Audite audiendo, et ne intelligite, et      videte videndo, et ne cognoscite; impingua cor populi hujus,      et aures ejus aggrava, et oculos ejus obline:... et 
dixi,      Quousque Domine? et dixit, Usque dum vastatae sunt urbes dum      nullus habitator, et domus dum nullus homo, et humus vastata      sit in solitudinem, vi 9-11; Matth. xiii 14, 15; Joh. 
xii 40,      41. [3] Quantum enim homo in amoribus sui et mundi est, et in eorum cupiditatibus, tantum occluditur ei Verbum; amores enim illi pro fine habent se, qui finis lumen naturale accendit, 
sed lucem caelestem exstinguit, sic ut acute videant illa quae sunt sui et mundi, et ne hilum quae sunt Domini et Ipsius regni; et cum ita est, quidem legere possunt Verbum, sed ex fine lucrandi 
honores et opes, aut ex fine ut appareant, aut ex {6} more et inde tracta consuetudine {7}, aut ex pio, et usque non ex fine emendandi vitam; </p>
<p>illis diversimode Verbum Occlusum est, quibusdam ita ut 
nequaquam scire velint aliud quam quod doctrinalia eorum dictant, qualiacumque sint; [4] ut si quis dixerit quod Petro non data sit potestas aperiendi caelum et claudendi illud, sed quod fidei amoris, 
quae per `claves Petri' significatur, quia obstat amor sui et mundi, nequaquam agnoscunt: et si quis dixerit quod sancti non colendi, sed unice Dominus, hoc nec recipiunt: si quis dixerit quod per 
panem et vinum in Sancta Cena intelligatur amor Domini erga universum genus humanum, et reciprocus hominis in Dominum, haec nec credunt: ac si quis dixerit quod fides nihil faciat nisi sit bonum fidei, 
hoc est, charitas, hoc inverse explicant; ita in reliquis: </p>
<p>qui tales sunt, ne hilum videre possunt, nec volunt videre verum quod(t) {8} in Verbo, sed obstinate manent in suo dogmate; et 
ne quidem audire volunt quod sensus internus sit, in quo sanctitas et gloria Verbi; immo cum audiunt quod sit, ad solum auditum ex aversatione nauseant: ita Occlusum est Verbum; cum tamen Verbum tale 
{9} est ut usque in caelum, et per caelum ad Dominum apertum sit, et solum clausum respective ad hominem, quantum is in malis amoris sui et mundi quoad fines vitae, et in principiis falsi inde, est.
