<h3 align="center" class="ired">属天的奥秘 第1106节</h3>
<h4 align="center"></h4><p><h4 align="center">消磨</h4><br />1106.有许多人在世时由于愚昧和无知，接受了不正确的宗教信仰。然而，他们有着一种符合其信仰原则的良知，不像有些人活在仇恨、报复和通奸的生活里。在来生，为免玷污天堂社群，只要这些人还保留那些谬念，他们就不能够被允许进入那些社群。为了去除他们的谬念，他们要在低层世界停留相当长的时间。逗留时间的长短，取决于他们错误的信念及其由此而来生活的性质，和取决于他们确认谬念的程度。有些人在那里所遭受的经历较为严历，而另外一些人则没有那么严历。这些受难的经历就叫做消磨，有关这方面在圣经里曾多次提及。当消磨的阶段完成后，他们便被接受他们的天使带上天堂，并作为新人接受信之真理的教导。</p>

<p><strong>[NCE]1106.</strong> Spiritual Devastation<br />THERE are many people who in their naiveté and ignorance soaked up falsities about religion while they were in the world, developed a certain brand of conscience harmonizing with the principles of their faith, and, unlike some others, did not live a life of hatred, revenge, and adultery. In the next world, they cannot be admitted into heavenly society as long as their ideas remain false, because if they were, they would contaminate it. So they are kept in an underground region for some time in order to slough off their false assumptions there. The period of their stay in that place is longer or shorter, depending on the nature of their false thinking and the kind of life it led them to adopt, and depending also on the degree to which they have cemented such principles in their minds. Some people suffer rather harshly there, some not so harshly.<br />This is what is called devastation, and mention of it comes up quite often in the Word.{*1} When their period of devastation has ended, they are lifted into heaven, where as novices they receive instruction in religious truth. The angels who welcome them are their teachers.<br /><br /><strong>Footnotes:</strong><br />{*1} For Scripture passages mentioning devastation of various kinds, see those quoted in <a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_1106/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_5376" target=_top>5376</a>.

CONCERNING VASTATIONS There are many persons who during their life in this world from simplicity and ignorance have imbibed falsities of religious belief, and yet have had a kind of conscience in accordance 
with the principles of their faith, and have not like others lived in hatred, revenge, and adultery. In the other life these persons cannot be introduced into heavenly societies so long as they 
remain in these falsities, for they would contaminate them; and they are therefore kept for a time in the lower earth, in order that they may get rid of their false principles. The time that they remain 
there is longer or shorter according to the nature of the falsity, and the life contracted thereby, and according to the degree in which they have confirmed themselves in their principles. Some 
suffer there severely, others not severely. These sufferings are what are called Vastations, of which there is frequent mention in the Word.* When the period of vastation is completed, they are taken 
up into heaven, and as newcomers are instructed in the truths of faith, and this by the angels by whom they are received. * Vastation in the Latin is the same word as wasting or laying waste. [Reviser.] </p>

VASTATIONS </p>
<p>There are many people who, when they were in the world, out of simplicity and ignorance absorbed falsities in respect to religious faith, but who possessed a kind of conscience that was 
in keeping with the basic assumptions of their faith. They did not live as others - hating, getting revenge, and committing adultery. In the next life those people cannot be admitted into heavenly communities 
as long as they are under the influence of falsity, for in that condition they would pollute those communities. They are detained therefore on the lower earth for a considerable length of time 
so as to get rid of those false assumptions. The length of time they stay there, long or short, depends on the nature of the falsity and of the life acquired from it, and on the extent to which those 
assumptions have been confirmed with them. Some there suffer quite severely, others not so. The experiences they undergo are called vastations, which receive considerable mention in the Word. When 
the period of vastation is completed they are carried into heaven and as newcomers receive instruction in the truths of faith, which is given by the angels who receive them. </p>

De Vastationibus </p>
<p>Sunt plures qui dum fuerunt in mundo, ex simplicitate et ignorantia, falsa quoad fidem imbuerunt, et quandam speciem conscientiae secundum fidei eorum principia habuerunt; et non, 
ut alii, in odiis, vindictis et adulteriis vixerunt; illi in altera vita quamdiu in falso sunt, non possunt intromitti in societates caelestes, sic enim illas contaminarent, quare in terra inferiore 
per aliquantum temporis tenentur ut ibi exuant principia falsi; tempora quibus ibi manent, sunt longiora et breviora, secundum naturam falsi et inde contractam vitam, et secundum confirmata apud se principia; 
quidam ibi satis dura patiuntur, quidam non dura: haec sunt quae appellantur 'vastationes,' quarum plurima mentio fit in Verbo:  peracto tempore vastationis auferuntur in caelum, et sicut novitii 
instruuntur in veris fidei, et hoc per angelos a quibus recipiuntur. </p>
