<h3 align="center" class="ired">属天的奥秘 第10465节</h3>
<h4 align="center"></h4><p><strong>10465</strong>.“撒在水面上”表与真理的混杂。这从“水”的含义清楚可知。“水”是指真理（参看<a href="10238.htm">10238</a>节提到的地方）；由于经上说牛犊所磨成的粉末撒在水面上，所以意思是说，由地狱的快乐所产生的虚假与来自天堂的真理混杂。这“水”之所以表示来自天堂的真理，是因为这水是从西乃山上流下来的，而“西乃山”表示神性真理所来自的天堂（<a href="9420.htm">9420</a>节）。这水来自西乃山，这一点清楚可见于摩西五经的别处经文：<br />我把你们的罪，就是你们所造的牛犊用火焚烧，又它捣碎，磨得很细，直到细如灰尘，我就把这灰尘撒在从山上流下来的溪水中。（申命记<a href="http://39-27.cn/申9.21.htm">9:21</a>）</p>

And strewed it upon the faces of the waters. That this signifies commixture with truths, is evident from the signification of "waters," as being truths (see the places cited in n. 10238); and as it is 
said that the powder into which the calf was ground was "strewed upon the waters," therefore it is signified that falsity from infernal delight was mixed with the truths which are from heaven. The reason 
why by these "waters" are signified truths which are from heaven, is that these waters descended from Mount Sinai, and by "Mount Sinai" is signified heaven from which is Divine truth (n. 9420). 
That these waters were from thence is evident elsewhere in Moses: </p>
<p>     I took your sin, the calf which ye had made, and burnt it with fire, and pounded it, grinding it well, until it was as fine as dust; 
and I cast the dust thereof into the brook that descended out of the mountain (Deut. 9:21). </p>

'And sprinkled it on the face of the water' means a mixing together with truths. This is clear from the meaning of 'the water' as truths, dealt with in the places referred to in <a href="10238.htm">10238</a>; and since it says 
that the powder into which the calf was ground up was sprinkled on the water the meaning is that the falsity resulting from hellish delight was mixed together with the truths coming from heaven. The 
reason why truths coming from heaven are meant by this water is that the water descended from Mount Sinai, and 'Mount Sinai' means heaven, from which Divine Truth comes, <a href="9420.htm">9420</a>. The fact that this water 
came from there is clear elsewhere in Moses,  </p>
<blockquote>
I took your sin which you had made, the calf, and burnt it in the fire, and crushed it by grinding it right down until it was fine dust; and I threw 
its dust into the brook descending out of the mountain. <a href="http://bible.gospelcom.net/cgi-bin/bible?passage=Deut%209:21&amp;version=ESV&amp;interface=print&amp;showfn=yes&amp;showxref">Deut 9:21</a>.

`Et sparsit super facies aquarum': quod significet commixtionem cum veris, constat ex significatione `aquarum' quod sint vera, de qua in locis citatis n. 10,238; et quia dicitur quod pollen in quem 
vitulus commolitus est sparsus sit super aquas, {1}ideo significatur quod falsum ex jucundo infernali commixtum sit cum veris quae ex caelo; quod per has aquas significentur vera quae ex caelo, est quia 
aquae illae {2}descendebant e monte Sinai, et per `montem Sinai' significatur caelum, ex quo Divinum Verum, n. 9420; quod illae aquae inde essent, constat alibi apud Moschen, 	Peccatum vestrum quod 
fecistis, vitulum sumpsi, et combussi   eum igne, et contudi eum molendo probe, usque dum attenuatus  est in {2}pulverem, et {3}pulverem ejus projeci in rivum descendentem e monte, Deut. ix 21. @1
