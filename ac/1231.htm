<h3 align="center" class="ired">属天的奥秘 第1231节</h3>
<h4 align="center"></h4><p><strong>1231.</strong>“路德”表对真理的认知。这从以下事实清楚可知：对真理的认知是以这样的方式获得的，即经由仁爱通过主，因而藉着理性和知识经由信而获得的。这也清楚可见于以西结书：<br />波斯人、路德人、弗人在你军营中作战士；他们在你中间悬挂盾牌和头盔，彰显你的尊荣。（以西结书<a href="http://39-27.cn/结27.10.htm">27:10</a>）<br />这论及推罗。“路德人、弗人”表认知，被说成是在她的军营中作战士，因为认知在理性的帮助下有助于扞卫真理，也就是“悬挂盾牌和头盔”。“弗人”表对圣言的外在认知（参看10:6）。</p>

<p><strong>[NCE]1231.</strong> The symbolism of Lud as knowledge of truth can be seen by considering that a knowledge of truth comes in this way — from the Lord through charity and so through faith by means of reason and learning. The symbolism can also be seen in Ezekiel:<br />Persia and Lud and Put were in your army; they were your men of war. Shield and helmet they hung on you; they themselves gave you your adornment. (<a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_1231/bible_king-james-version_ezekiel_27_10" target=_top>Ezekiel 27:10</a>)<br />Tyre is the subject here. Lud and Put stand for points of knowledge, which are described as being in the army and as being men of war, because they serve to defend truth, with the aid of reason; and this service is also the hanging of shield and helmet. For the symbolism of Put as superficial knowledge of the Word, see above at verse <a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_1231/bible_king-james-version_genesis_10_6" target=_top>6</a> of this chapter [<a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_1231/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_1163" target=_top>1163-1164</a>, <a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_1231/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_1166" target=_top>1166</a>]. </p>
<p align="center"><b>Potts(1905-1910) 1231</b></p><p><b>1231.</b>
That by "Lud" are signified the knowledges of truth, is evident from the fact that the knowledges of truth are from that source, that is, from the Lord through charity, and thus through faith, by means 
of reason and of memory-knowledge. So also in Ezekiel: </p>
<p>     Persia and Lud and Put were in thine army, thy men of war; they hanged the shield and helmet in thee; they set forth thine honor (Ezek. 
27:10). This is said of Tyre. "Lud and Put" denote knowledges, which are said to be in her army and to be her men of war, because they serve in defending truths with the aid of reason. This also is to 
"hang the shield and helmet." That "Put" signifies the exterior knowledges of the Word, may be seen above, at verse 6 of this chapter. </p>

<p align="center"><b>Elliott(1983-1999) 1231</b></p><p><b>1231.</b>
That 'Lud' means cognitions of truth is clear from the fact that cognitions of truth are obtained in this manner, namely from the Lord through charity and so through faith, by means of reason and knowledge. 
It is clear also in Ezekiel, </p>
<blockquote>
Persia and Lud and Put were in your army, as your men of war; they hung the shield and helmet in you, they gave you your splendour. <a href="http://bible.gospelcom.net/cgi-bin/bible?passage=Ezek%2027:10&amp;version=ESV&amp;interface=print&amp;showfn=yes&amp;showxref">Ezek 27:10</a>. 
</blockquote>
<p>This refers 
to Tyre. 'Lud and Put' stands for cognitions, which are spoken of as being 'in its army' and as being 'men of war' because cognitions with the support of reason serve to defend truths, which is also 'hanging 
the shield and helmet'. That 'Put' means exterior cognitions of the Word, see above at verse 6 of this chapter. </p>

<p align="center"><b>Latin(1748-1756) 1231</b>
</p><b>1231.</b>
Quod per 'Lud' significentur cognitiones veri, constat ex eo quod cognitiones veri sint inde, nempe a Domino per charitatem, et sic per fidem, media ratione et scientia:  tum quoque apud Ezechielem, Persia 
et Lud et Put fuerunt in exercitu tuo, viri belli tui, scutum et,, galeam suspenderunt in te, illi dederunt decorem tuum, xxvii 10; </p>
<p>ubi de Tyro; 'Lud et Put' pro cognitionibus, quae dicuntur 
'in exercitu, et viri belli,' quia inserviunt defendendis veris, rationis adminiculo, quod etiam est 'scutum et galeam suspendere'; quod per 'Put' significentur cognitiones exteriores Verbi, videatur 
supra ad vers. 6 hujus capitis. </p>
