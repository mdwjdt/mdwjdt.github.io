Verses 3-5. And God Shaddai will bless thee, and will make thee fruitful and multiply thee, and thou shalt be a company of peoples. And He will give thee the blessing of Abraham, to thee and to thy seed 
with thee, to cause thee to inherit the land of thy sojournings, which God gave unto Abraham. And Isaac sent away Jacob; and he went to Paddan-aram, to Laban the son of Bethuel the Aramean, the brother 
of Rebekah, the mother of Jacob and Esau. "And God Shaddai will bless thee," signifies the temptations of that truth and good through which there is conjunction; "and will make thee fruitful and 
multiply thee," signifies the derivative goods and truths; "and thou shalt be a company of peoples," signifies abundance; "and He will give thee the blessing of Abraham," signifies the conjunction of 
the Divine Itself with the good and truth of the natural; "to thee and to thy seed with thee," signifies with the good and its derivative truth; "to cause thee to inherit the land of thy sojournings," 
signifies the life of instructions; which God gave unto Abraham," signifies which is from the Divine; "and Isaac sent away Jacob," signifies the beginning of manifestation; "and he went to Paddan-aram," 
signifies here as before the knowledges of that truth; "to Laban the son of Bethuel the Aramean," signifies collateral good; "the brother of Rebekah, the mother of Jacob and Esau," signifies the 
affinity from the mother, with the good of truth which is "Jacob," and with the truth of good which is "Esau." </p>

Verses 3-5 And God Shaddai will bless you, and make you fruitful and multiply you; and you will be an assembly of peoples. And He will give you the blessing of Abraham, you and your seed with you, to 
inherit the land of your sojournings, which God gave to Abraham. And Isaac sent Jacob away; and he went to Paddan Aram, to Laban the son of Bethuel the Aramean, the brother of Rebekah, Jacob and Esau's 
mother. </p>
<p>'God Shaddai will bless you' means the temptations to which that truth and good was subjected and by means of which the joining together was effected. 'And make you fruitful and multiply 
you' means the goods and truths deriving from that joining together. 'And you will be an assembly of peoples' means abundance. 'And He will give you the blessing of Abraham' means the joining of the 
Divine itself to the good and truth of the natural. 'You and your seed with you' means to the good and the truth born from this good. 'To inherit the land of your sojournings' means the life acquired 
through receiving instruction. 'Which God gave to Abraham' means which is received from the Divine. 'And Isaac sent Jacob away' means the beginning of the manifestation [of the Divine Natural]. 'And he 
went to Paddan Aram' means here, as previously, the cognitions of that truth. 'To Laban the son of Bethuel the Aramean' means a parallel good. 'The brother of Rebekah, Jacob and Esau's mother' means 
the relationship through the mother of the good of truth, represented by 'Jacob', with the truth of good, represented by 'Esau'. </p>

Vers. 3-5.  Et Deus Shaddai benedicet tibi, et faciet fructificari te, et multiplicari te,' et eris in coetum populorum.  Et dabit tibi benedictionem Abrahami, tibi et semini tuo cum te, ad hereditandum 
te terram peregrinationum tuarum, quam dedit Deus Abrahamo.  Et misit Jischak Jacobum, et ivit Paddanem Aram, ad Labanem filium Bethuelis Aramaei, fratrem Rebeccae matris Jacobi et Esavi.  `Deus 
Shaddai benedicet tibi' significat tentationes illius veri et boni, per quas conjunctio: `et faciet fructificari te et multiplicari te' significat inde bona et vera:  `et eris in coetum populorum' significat 
copiam: `et dabit tibi benedictionem Abrahami' significat conjunctionem Ipsius Divini cum bono et vero naturalis:  `tibi et semini tuo cum te' significat cum bono et vero quod inde:  `ad hereditandum
