<h3 align="center" class="ired">属天的奥秘 第6056节</h3>
<h4 align="center"></h4><p><strong>6056.</strong>刚才我们说明，内在人因是在先的，故离了外在人也能持续存在，因为这外在人是在后的；而外在人因是在后的，故离了内在人无法持续存在。因为这是一条普世律法，即：任何事物都无法靠自己持续存在，只能靠着并通过另一个事物持续存在；因此，任何事物若不靠着并通过另一个事物，就无法被维持在它所拥有的形式中，自然界的每一个事物都证明了这一点。人也是如此，就他的外在人而言，他若不靠着并通过内在人，就无法持续存在。而内在人若不靠着并通过天堂，也无法持续存在；天堂同样无法靠自己持续存在，只能靠着并通过主持续存在，唯独主靠自己持续存在，即自存或自有。那使万物存在并持续存在的，是流注；因为万物通过流注持续存在。我们将在下文说明，主通过流注不仅间接经由灵界，还真理在中间原因和最终结果上使每一个事物持续存在。</p>

It has been said that the internal man, being prior, can subsist without the external, because this is posterior; but not the converse. For it is a universal rule that nothing can subsist from itself, 
but from and through something else, consequently that nothing can be kept in form except from and through something else, which may also be seen from everything in nature. The case is the same with 
man. In respect to his external, man cannot subsist except from and through his internal. Neither can the internal man subsist except from and through heaven. And neither can heaven subsist from itself, 
but only from the Lord, who alone subsists from Himself. Influx is according to existence and subsistence, for all things subsist by means of influx. But that all things in general and in particular 
subsist by influx from the Lord, not only mediately through the spiritual world, but also immediately in both mediates and ultimates, will be shown in what follows. </p>

It has just been said that being prior the internal man can remain in being without the external, but not the external man, being posterior, without the internal. For it is a universal law that nothing 
can remain in being by itself, only from and through another, consequently that nothing can be maintained within the form it possesses except from and through another, as every single thing in the 
natural order goes to prove. The same is true of the human being. So far as his external man is concerned, he cannot remain in being except from and through the internal. But the internal man cannot remain 
in being except from and through heaven; nor yet can heaven do so from itself, only from and through the Lord, who alone is Self-existent. What makes all coming into and remaining in being is influx, 
for influx is the means by which all things are kept in being. But it will be shown in a later section that through influx the Lord keeps every single thing in being, not only indirectly through 
the spiritual world but also directly both in intermediate causes and in ultimate effects. </p>

</p><b>6056.</b>
Dictum est quod homo internus quia prior, subsistere possit absque externo quia posterior, non autem vicissim; nam canon universalis est quod nihil subsistere possit a se sed ex alio et per aliud, consequenter 
quod nihil teneri {1}possit in forma nisi ex alio et per aliud; quod etiam constare potest a singulis in natura; similiter se habet in homine; homo quoad externum non subsistere potest nisi 
ex interno et per internum; nec internus homo potest subsistere nisi ex caelo et per caelum; et nec caelum potest subsistere ex se sed ex Domino Qui Solus subsistit ex Se: secundum existentiam et subsistentiam 
est influxus, nam per influxum subsistunt omnia; at quod per influxum omnia et singula a Domino subsistant, non solum mediate per mundum spiritualem sed etiam immediate tam in mediis quam 
in ultimis, in sequentibus demonstrabitur. @1 queat$  </p>
