Verses 29-33. And he commanded them, and said unto them, I am being gathered unto my people; bury me unto my fathers unto the cave that is in the field of Ephron the Hittite; in the cave that is in the 
field of Machpelah, which is upon the faces of Mamre, in the land of Canaan, which Abraham bought with the field from Ephron the Hittite for a possession of a sepulcher. There they buried Abraham and 
Sarah his wife; there they buried Isaac and Rebekah his wife; and there I buried Leah: the purchase of the field and of the cave that is therein, was from the sons of Heth. And Jacob finished commanding 
his sons, and he gathered up his feet unto the bed, and expired, and was gathered unto his peoples. "And he commanded them, and said unto them," signifies insinuation; "I am being gathered unto 
my people," signifies that he would be in the goods and truths of the natural which are from him; "bury me unto my fathers," signifies that therein also are interior things and what is inmost; "unto the 
cave," signifies where is obscurity; "that is in the field of Ephron the Hittite," signifies which nevertheless can become clear; "in the cave that is in the field of Machpelah," signifies in this 
obscurity; "which is upon the faces of Mamre," signifies the quantity and quality thereof; "in the land of Canaan," signifies where the church is; "which Abraham bought with the field from Ephron the 
Hittite," signifies redemption; "for a possession of a sepulcher" signifies regeneration; "there they buried Abraham and Sarah his wife, there they buried Isaac and Rebekah his wife, and there I buried 
Leah," signifies that all the interior things are in order in the good and truth in the natural; "the purchase of the field and of the cave that is therein was from the sons of Heth," signifies the 
redemption of those who receive truth, and through truth good; "and Jacob finished commanding his sons," signifies the effect of the insinuation; "and he gathered up his feet unto the bed," signifies 
as to his lower things in which were things interior, unto the good and truth of the lower natural; "and expired," signifies new life there; "and was gathered unto his peoples," signifies that he was 
in the goods and truths of the natural which are from him. </p>

Verses 29-33 And he commanded them and said to them, I am being gathered to my people; bury me with my fathers, at the cave which is in the field of Ephron the Hittite, in the cave which is in the field 
of Machpelah, which faces Mamre in the land of Canaan, which Abraham bought with the field from Ephron the Hittite as a possession for a grave. There they buried Abraham and Sarah his wife; there 
they buried Isaac and Rebekah his wife; and there I buried Leah. The buying of the field and of the cave that was in it was from the sons of Heth. And Jacob finished commanding his sons, and he gathered 
up his feet towards the bed, and expired, and was gathered to his peoples. </p>
<p>'And he commanded them and said to them' means an introduction. 'I am being gathered to my people' means that [spiritual 
good] will come to exist within the forms of good and the truths of the natural which spring from that good. 'Bury me with my fathers' means that interior things and what is inmost will exist there 
too. 'At the cave' means where obscurity exists. 'Which is in the field of Ephron the Hittite' means which however can be made into clear light. 'In the cave which is in the field of Machpelah' means 
in that obscurity. 'Which faces Mamre' means the extent and nature of it. 'In the land of Canaan' means where the Church is. 'Which Abraham bought with the field from Ephron the Hittite' means redemption. 
'As a possession for a grave' means regeneration. 'There they buried Abraham and Sarah his wife, there they buried Isaac and Rebekah his wife, and there I buried Leah' means that all the interior 
things are present in order within good and truth in the natural. 'The buying of the field and of the cave that was in it was from the sons of Heth' means the redemption of those who receive truth, and 
through truth receive good. 'And Jacob finished commanding his sons' means the accomplishment of the introduction. 'And he gathered up his feet towards the bed' means that [spiritual good] turned itself 
- its lower things in which interior ones are present - towards the good and truth of the lower natural. 'And expired' means new life there. 'And was gathered to his peoples' means that [spiritual 
good] was within the forms of good and the truths of the natural that sprang from itself. </p>

Vers. 29-33.  Et praecepit illis et dixit ad illos, Ego colligor ad populum meum, sepelite me ad patres meos, ad speluncam quae in agro Ephronis Hittaei.  In spelunca quae in agro Machpelah, quae super 
facies Mamre in terra Canaan, quam emit Abraham cum agro ex Ephrone Hittaeo ad possessionem sepulcri.  Ibi sepeliverunt Abrahamum et Saram uxorem ejus, ibi sepeliverunt Jishakum et Rebeccam uxorem 
ejus, et ibi sepelivi Leam.  Emptio agri et speluncae quae in illo, ex filius Hethi.  Et absolvit Jacob ad praecipiendum filiis suis, et collegit pedes suos ad lectum, et exspiravit, et collectus ad 
populos suos. `Et praecepit illis et dixit ad illos' significat insinuationem: `Ego colligor ad populum meum significat quod erit in bonis et veris naturalis quae ab illo: `sepelite me ad patres meos' 
significat quod ibi quoque interiora et intimum:  ad speluncam' significat ubi obscurum: `quae in agro Ephronis Hittaei' significat quod tamen clarum fieri potest: `in spelunca quae in agro Machpelah' 
significat in obscuro illo: `quae super facies Mamre' significat quantum (x)et quale ejus: `in terra Canaan' significat ubi Ecclesia: `quam emit Abraham cum agro ex Ephrone Hittaeo' significat redemptionem: 
`ad possessionem sepulcri' significat regenerationem:  `ibi sepeliverunt Abrahamum et Saram uxorem ejus, ibi sepeliverunt Jishakum et Rebeccam uxorem ejus, et ibi sepelivi Leam' significat quod 
omnia interiora ordine in bono et vero in naturali: `emptio agri et speluncae quae in illo ex filiis Hethi' significat redemptionem illorum qui recipiunt verum, et per verum bonum: `et absolvit Jacob 
ad praecipiendum filiis suis' significat insinuationis effectum: `et collegit pedes suos ad lectum' significat quoad inferiora sua in quibus interiora, ad bonum et verum naturalis inferioris: `et exspiravit' 
significat novam vitam ibi: `et collectus ad populos suos' significat quod esset in bonis et veris naturalis quae a se.   </p>
