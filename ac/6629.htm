<h3 align="center" class="ired">属天的奥秘 第6629节</h3>
<h4 align="center"></h4><p><strong>6629.</strong>这就是古代教会之人的特征，故他们活在一个更内在的层面；他们因活在那个层面，故拥有更大的智慧。因为就其内在人而言，那些处于爱与仁之良善的人就在天堂，在一个处于类似良善的天使社群中。他们的心智由此被提升至更内在的层面，从而被提升至智慧；因为智慧只能来自天堂，而非其它源头，也就是说，经由天堂来自主；智慧之所以居于天堂，是因为在那里的人都处于良善。</p>

<p align="center"><b>Potts(1905-1910) 6629</b></p><p><b>6629.</b>
Such being the character of the Ancient Churches, they were more interior men, and being more interior they were more wise; for those who are in the good of love and of charity are as to the internal 
man in heaven, and in an angelic society there which is in like good. From this they have an elevation of mind to interior things, and consequently to the things of wisdom; for wisdom can come from no 
other source than heaven, that is, through heaven from the Lord; and in heaven there is wisdom, because there they are in good. </p>

<p align="center"><b>Elliott(1983-1999) 6629</b></p><p><b>6629.</b>
Since this is what the people of the Ancient Churches were like, they lived on a more internal level; and since they lived on that level they had greater wisdom. For those who are governed by the good 
of love and charity are in heaven so far as their internal man is concerned and are in an angelic community there that is governed by a good similar to their own. Their minds have therefore been raised 
to things on a more internal level, and as a consequence wisdom is theirs. Wisdom can come from no other source than heaven, that is, from the Lord by way of heaven; and wisdom resides in heaven because 
those who are there are governed by good. </p>

Quia tales fuerunt Antiquae Ecclesiae, idcirco interiores homines fuerunt, et quia interiores, fuerunt sapientiores; nam qui in bono amoris et charitatis sunt, illi quoad internum {1}hominem in caelo 
sunt, et ibi in societate angelica quae in simili bono est; inde elevatio mentis eorum ad interiora, et consequenter illis sapientia; aliunde enim sapientia non venire potest quam e caelo, hoc est, per 
caelum a Domino; ac in caelo est sapientia quia {2}ibi in bono sunt. @1 i suum$ @2 Before in caelo$ </p>
