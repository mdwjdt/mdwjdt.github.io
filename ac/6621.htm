<h3 align="center" class="ired">属天的奥秘 第6621节</h3>
<h4 align="center"></h4><p><strong>6621.</strong>那些活在肉身期间在阅读圣言时只专注于批判艺术的人很少关心真实的含义，他们的思维表现为缠在一起、无法解开的线，以及由这些线所制成的织物。当像这样的一些灵人与我同在时，我所思想并写下的一切都变得混乱起来。可以说我的思维被关在了监狱里，因为它因着我的心智从含义退出而局限于话语，以致他们使我疲累不堪。然而，他们以为自己比其他人更智慧。</p>

The thoughts of those who in the life of the body have studied the mere art of criticism when reading the Word, being little concerned about the sense, were represented as lines closed and not capable 
of being opened, and as a texture formed of such lines. Some spirits of this kind have been with me, and then all that was being thought and written became confused, the thought being kept as it were 
in prison, for it was determined solely to words, by withdrawing the mind from the sense, so that they wearied me past expression; and yet they believed themselves wiser than others. </p>

As for those who when they read the Word during their lifetime concentrated on employing the art of criticism, having little concern for the real meaning, their thoughts have been represented as threads 
that were entwined and incapable of being undone, and as fabric made from them. When some spirits like this have been present with me, everything I thought and wrote down became confused. My thought 
was so to speak detained in prison, for it was limited to words by the withdrawal of my mind from meaning, so much so that those spirits thoroughly wore me out. Yet they thought they were wiser than others. </p>

Qui in vita corporis solum studuerunt arti criticae cum legerunt Verbum, parum de sensu solliciti, cogitationes eorum repraesentatae sunt sicut lineae clausae non {1}apertibiles, et sicut textura inde; 
quidam tales apud me fuerunt, tunc omnia quae cogitabantur et scribebantur, {2} confusa fiebant, cogitatione quasi in carcere detenta, nam solum determinabatur ad voces abstrahendo mentem a sensu, 
adeo ut maximopere me defatigarent; et usque illi se credebant aliis sapientiores. @1 apertiles$ @2 i obscura et$ </p>
