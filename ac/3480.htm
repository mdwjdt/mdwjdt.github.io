<h4 align="center"></h4><p><strong>3480.</strong>我还被指示这个民族所具有的一切不洁如何不会阻碍圣言的内层，或它的属灵和属天之物在天堂显现。实际上，一切不洁都被移除，以至于察觉不到，邪恶也转化为良善，因此纯粹的外在圣洁充当一个基础，圣言的内在事物在此基础上毫无障碍地呈现在天使面前。由此向我显明，内心崇拜偶像的人如何能代表神圣事物，甚至代表主自己，因而主如何能居于他们的不洁中间（利未记<a href="http://39-27.cn/利16.16.htm">16:16</a>）；因此那里如何会有教会的外表；因为纯代表性的教会不过是教会的形像而已，并非实际的教会本身。<br />对基督徒来说，制造这样的局面就不那么容易了。因为他们知道敬拜的内在方面，却不相信它们。因此，他们不可能对脱离内在的外在事物有任何神圣的感觉。此外，对那些过着信仰生活的人而言，交流通过他们所具有的良善实现，因为与此同时，邪恶与虚假被逐出了。值得注意的是，当他们阅读圣言时，圣言的每一个细节都展现在天使面前。即便这些人在阅读圣言时并未留意它的含义，这一切照样发生。这一事实也通过大量经历向我显明了，因为这些人的内在虽然不那么容易觉察，但能充当一个基础。</p>

It was also shown how the unclean things with that nation did not prevent the interiors of the Word, or its spiritual and celestial things, from being nevertheless presented in heaven; for the unclean 
things were removed so as not to be perceived, and evils were turned to good, so that the mere external holiness served as a plane, and thus the internal things of the Word were presented before the 
angels, without the interposition of any hindrances. From this it was made manifest how that people, interiorly idolatrous, could represent things holy, and even the Lord Himself; and thus how the Lord 
could dwell in the midst of their uncleanness (Lev. 16:16); consequently how there could be something like a church there; for a church merely representative is a semblance of a church, and not a church. 
 [2] With Christians this cannot be the case, because they are acquainted with the interior things of worship, but do not believe them; thus they cannot be in a holy external separate from its 
internal. Moreover with those who are in the life of faith, communication is effected by the goods pertaining to them, evils and falsities being in the meantime removed; and it is a remarkable fact that 
all things of the Word, when being read by them, lie open to the angels, and this even though they who read do not attend to its meaning (as has been shown me by much experience); for the internal 
in them, which is not so perceptible, serves as a plane. </p>

I have also been shown how all the uncleanness present with that nation still did not prevent the interior aspects of the Word - that is, its inner spiritual and celestial content - from manifesting 
themselves in heaven. Actually all that uncleanness was taken away so as not to be noticed, and evils were also converted into good, so that mere external holiness might serve as a basis, in which the 
internal aspects of the Word were thereby presented to angels without the intrusion of any hindrances. From this it was evident to me how that inwardly idolatrous people were able to represent holy things, 
even the Lord Himself, and so how the Lord was able to dwell in the midst of all their uncleanness, <a href="http://bible.gospelcom.net/cgi-bin/bible?passage=Lev%2016:16&amp;version=ESV&amp;interface=print&amp;showfn=yes&amp;showxref">Lev 16:16</a>, and so to have the semblance of the Church there, for a merely representative Church 
is only a likeness of the Church and not the actual Church itself. </p>
<p></p>
<p><b>[2]</b>
 Among Christians it is less easy to create the same situation since they do have a knowledge of the interior aspects of worship, 
though they do not believe them. Thus they are not able to have any holy feelings for external things divorced from internal. Furthermore with people who lead the life of faith communication is 
effected by means of the goods present within them - evils and falsities having meanwhile been banished. And at this point - amazingly so - every single detail of the Word when read by them is manifested 
before the angels. This happens despite the fact that those persons reading the Word pay no attention to the sense of it. This has been shown to me from much experience, for with those people the 
internal which is not so perceptible serves as a basis. </p>

Ostensum etiam est quomodo immunda apud illam gentem non impediverint quin Verbi interiora, seu ejus spiritualia et caelestia, in caelo usque sisterentur; immunda enim removebantur ut non appercepta, 
etiam mala in bonum vertebantur, sic ut modo externum sanctum pro plano inserviret, ita sistebantur coram angelis, absque interjectis remoris, interna Verbi; (m)inde patuit quomodo {1}populus ille interius 
idololatra potuerit repraesentare {2}sancta, immo Ipsum Dominum, {3}ita quomodo Dominus in medio immunditiarum eorum {4}potuerit habitare, Lev. xvi 16; proinde Ecclesiae simile ibi habere, nam 
Ecclesia mere repraesentativa est instar Ecclesiae, non est Ecclesia.(n) 2 Apud Christianos hoc ita non fieri potest quia norunt interiora {5}cultus, sed illis non credunt; ita {6}non in sancto externo 
separato ab interno possunt esse; praeter apud illos qui in vita fidei sunt, per bona apud illos fit communicatio, remotis interea malis et falsis, et tunc, quod mirum, omnia et singula {7}Verbi quod 
ab his legitur, coram angelis patent, et {8}hoc quoque tametsi illi non ad sensum ejus attendunt, quod mihi pluri experientia ostensum est, nam internum apud illos, quod non ita perceptibile est, pro 
plano inservit. @1 populis I$  @2 caelestia$  @3 i quamvis nihil crediderunt$  @4 potuit esse$  @5 fidei$  @6 nec$  @7 in Verbo, cum$  @8 hoc tametsi homo non ad sensum ejus attendit$  </p>
