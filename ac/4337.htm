<h3 align="center" class="ired">属天的奥秘 第4337节</h3>
<h4 align="center"></h4><p><h4 align="center">内义</h4><br />4337.在前几章论及“雅各”的地方，就内义而言，所论述的主题是属世层中真理的获取，这种获取是为了这真理能与良善结合，因为一切真理都是为这个目的而存在的。就内义而言，“雅各”就是这真理，“以扫”则是与该真理结合的良善。在这结合实现之前，真理看似占据第一位；但结合之后，良善实际上占据第一位（参看<a href="3539.htm">3539</a>，<a href="3548.htm">3548</a>，<a href="3556.htm">3556</a>，<a href="3563.htm">3563</a>，<a href="3570.htm">3570</a>，<a href="3576.htm">3576</a>，<a href="3603.htm">3603</a>，<a href="3701.htm">3701</a>，<a href="3995.htm">3995</a>节）。这也是以撒对以扫的预言所表示的：<br />你必倚靠刀剑生活，又必事奉你的兄弟；到你掌权的时候，你必从颈项上挣开他的轭。（创世记<a href="http://39-27.cn/创27.40.htm">27:40</a>）<br />现在这一章描述的就是这种状态。这就是为何雅各称以扫为他的“主”，自称是以扫的“仆人”（33:5，8，13，14）。<br />要知道，雅各在此代表真理的良善。但就其本身而言，真理的良善仅仅是真理；因为真理只要唯独存在于记忆中，就被称作真理。不过，一旦存在于意愿，由此存在于行为中，它就被称作真理的良善，因为真理的实践并非别的。凡从意愿发出的，皆被称为良善，因为意愿的本质就是爱和从爱流出的情感；出于爱及其情感所行的一切被冠以良善之名。真理也无法与经由内在人流入、在源头上为神性的良善结合（这良善在此由“以扫”来代表），直到真理成为存在于意愿和行为中的真理，也就是真理的良善。因为经由内在人流入、在源头上为神性的良善流入意愿，在那里与经由外在人所引入的真理之良善会合。</p>

THE INTERNAL SENSE. In the foregoing chapters, where "Jacob" is spoken of, the subject treated of in the internal sense was the acquisition of truth in the natural, which acquisition is made in order 
that this truth may be conjoined with good, for all truth is for the sake of this end. "Jacob," in the internal sense, is this truth, and "Esau" is the good with which the truth is to be conjoined. 
Before the conjunction is effected, truth appears to be in the first place; but after the conjunction, good is actually in the first place (see n. 3539, 3548, 3556, 3563, 3570, 3576, 3603, 3701, 3995). 
This is also what is signified by the prophecy of Isaac to Esau: "Upon thy sword shalt thou live, and thou shalt serve thy brother; and it shall come to pass when thou shalt have the dominion, that 
thou shall break his yoke from off thy neck" (Gen. 27:40). And this state is what is described in the present chapter. For this reason Jacob calls Esau his "lord," and himself his "servant" (verses 5, 
8, 13, 14).  [2] Be it known that Jacob here represents the good of truth. But regarded in itself the good of truth is only truth; for so long as truth is in the memory only, it is called truth; but 
when in the will and thence in act, it is called the good of truth; for to do truth is nothing else. Whatever proceeds from the will is called good, for the essential of the will is love and the derivative 
affection; and everything that is done from love and its affection is named good. Neither can truth be conjoined with the good that flows in through the internal man and is in its origin Divine 
(which is here represented by Esau), until the truth is truth in will and act; that is, the good of truth. For the good that flows in through the internal man and is in its origin Divine, flows into 
the will, and there meets the good of truth that has been instilled through the external man. </p>

THE INTERNAL SENSE </p>
<p>Where Jacob is referred to in previous chapters, the subject in the internal sense has been the acquisition of truth within the Natural, an acquisition which is made there so that 
such truth may be joined to good; for all truth exists for the sake of that end. In the internal sense 'Jacob' is that truth, and 'Esau' is the good to which it is joined. Before the two are joined 
together truth seems to occupy first place, but after they have been joined good in fact does so, see <a href="3539.htm">3539</a>, <a href="3548.htm">3548</a>, <a href="3556.htm">3556</a>, <a href="3563.htm">3563</a>, <a href="3570.htm">3570</a>, <a href="3576.htm">3576</a>, <a href="3603.htm">3603</a>, <a href="3701.htm">3701</a>, <a href="3995.htm">3995</a> This is also what is meant by Isaac's prophecy 
addressed to Esau, </p>
<blockquote>
By your sword you will live, and you will serve your brother; and it will be, when you have dominion over him, that you will break his yoke from your neck. <a href="http://bible.gospelcom.net/cgi-bin/bible?passage=Gen%2027:40&amp;version=ESV&amp;interface=print&amp;showfn=yes&amp;showxref">Gen 27:40</a>. 
</blockquote>
<p>That 
state foretold there is the actual subject now. And this is why in verses 5, 8, 13, 14 of the present chapter Jacob calls Esau his lord and himself Esau's servant </p>
<p></p>
<p><b>[2]</b>
 It should be recognized that 
'Jacob' at this point represents the good of truth. But regarded in itself such good is simply truth, for as long as truth exists solely in the memory it is referred to as truth. But once it exists in 
the will and as a consequence in action it is called the good of truth, for the performance of truth is nothing else. Whatever proceeds from the will is called good since in essence the will consists 
in love and in affection flowing from love, and everything that is done from love and attendant affection is termed good Nor is truth able to be joined to good which flows in by way of the internal man 
and is Divine in origin - which good is represented here by 'Esau' - until truth exists as truth in will and action, that is, as the good of truth For good which flows in by way of the internal man 
and is Divine in origin flows into the will, and there meets the good of truth which has been introduced by way of the external man. </p>

SENSUS INTERNUS </p>
<p>In capitibus quae praecedunt, in sensu interno, ubi de Jacobo, de acquisitione veri in Naturali {1} actum est, quae acquisitio fit ut conjungi possit bono, nam omne verum est propter illum 
finem; `Jacob' in sensu interno est (o)id verum, et `Esau' est bonum cui verum conjungendum est.  Antequam conjunctio fit, verum apparet primo loco esse, sed post conjunctionem est bonum actualiter 
primo loco, videantur n. 3539, 3548, 3556, 3563, 3570, 3576, 3603, 3701, 3995; id quoque est quod significatur per propheticum Isaci ad Esavum,           Super gladio tuo vives, et fratri 
tuo servies, et erit,      quando dominaris, et disrumpes jugum illius de collo tuo,      Gen. xxvii 40; </p>
<p>hic nunc agitur de illo statu; inde est quod Jacob vocet {2} Esau dominum suum, et se 
servum, in hoc capite vers. 5, 8, 13, 14.  Sciendum quod `Jacob' hic repraesentet veri bonum, sed veri bonum {3} in se spectatum est modo verum; verum enim quamdiu in sola memoria est, dicitur verum; 
at cum in voluntate et inde in actu, vocatur {4} veri bonum; facere enim verum non aliud est; quicquid procedit ex voluntate, dicitur bonum, nam essentiale voluntatis est amor et inde affectio, 
et omne quod ex amore et ejus affectione fit {5}, nuncupatur bonum: verum etiam nec (t)conjungi potest bono quod per internum hominem influit et origine Divinum est, quod hic repraesentatur per `Esavum,' 
priusquam verum voluntate et actu est verum, hoc est, veri bonum; nam bonum quod per internum hominem influit et origine Divinum est, hoc influit in voluntatem, et ibi occurrit veri bono quod 
per externum hominem insinuatum est.      @1 ubi de Jacobo, in sensu interno de acquisitione veri naturalis$      @2 i nunc$      @3 tale quod$      @4 i tunc$      @5 A had procedit but d$ </p>
