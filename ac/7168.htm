<h3 align="center" class="ired">属天的奥秘 第7168节</h3>
<h4 align="center"></h4><p><strong>7168.</strong>“他就恶待这百姓”表那时，那些处于教会的真理和良善之人似乎受到所引入的虚假的伤害。这从“恶待”的含义和以色列人的代表清楚可知。“恶待”是指通过引入虚假进行伤害，在此是指似乎受到伤害；事实上，那些经历侵扰和试探的人不可能受到所引入的虚假的伤害，因为主保护他们。以色列人，即此处的“百姓”，是指那些处于教会的真理和良善之人，如前所述（<a href="7162.htm">7162</a>节）。</p>

<p align="center"><b>Potts(1905-1910) 7168</b></p><p><b>7168.</b>
He hath done evilly to this people. That this signifies that then through the injected falsities those who are in the truths and goods of the church seemed to be injured, is evident from the signification 
of "doing evil," as being to injure by means of the injected falsities, here to seem to be injured; for they who are in infestation and in temptation cannot be injured by injected falsities, because 
the Lord protects them; and from the representation of the sons of Israel, who are here "the people," as being those who are in the truths of the church and its goods (as above, n. 7162). </p>

<p align="center"><b>Elliott(1983-1999) 7168</b></p><p><b>7168.</b>
'He has done ill to this people' means that at that time those governed by the Church's truths and forms of good seemingly suffered harm from the falsities that had been introduced. This is clear from 
the meaning of 'doing ill' as doing harm by introducing falsities, here seemingly to suffer harm, for those who undergo molestation and temptation cannot in fact suffer harm from falsities that have 
been introduced because the Lord protects them; and from the representation of the children of Israel, to whom 'people' refers here, as those governed by the Church's truths and its forms of good, as 
above in <a href="7162.htm">7162</a>. </p>

<p align="center"><b>Latin(1748-1756) 7168</b>
</p><b>7168.</b>
`Malefecit populo huic':  quod significet quod tunc per injecta falsa viderentur laedi illi qui in Ecclesiae veris et bonis, constat ex significatione `malefacere' quod sit laedere per injecta falsa, 
`hic videri laedi, nam qui in infestatione et in tentatione sunt non possunt per injecta falsa laedi, Dominus enim tutatur; et ex repraesentatione `filiorum Israelis,' qui hic sunt populus, quod sint 
qui in veris Ecclesiae et bonis ejus, ut supra n. 7162. </p>
