<h3 align="center" class="ired">属天的奥秘 第1936节</h3>
<h4 align="center"></h4><p><strong>1936.</strong>“回到你主母那里”表该答复指示第一理性不应信靠自己，而应信靠内层真理和对它的情感。这从“主母”的含义清楚可知，“主母”表对内层真理的情感。不过，“撒莱”、“妻子撒莱”和“主母撒莱”的具体含义无法描述，因为没有任何观念能清晰地理解它们。如前所述，所表示的这些事物远远超出理解力，甚至超出天使的理解力。此处仅暗示主如何思考引起祂第一理性注意的表象，也就是说，不应信靠这类表象，而应信靠神性真理本身，无论这些真理在理性看来如何显得难以置信。所有神性真理的情形都是如此，若就这些真理请教理性，它们绝不可能被相信，因为它们超出理解力的整个范畴。例如，世人、灵人或天使都不能凭自己活着，唯有主能。世人、灵人或天使所具有的生命只是在他里面的生命的外在表象。在通过谬论或幻觉判断的理性看来，这是矛盾的，但它应被相信，因为它是真理。<br />这是一个神性真理：圣言的每句话在世人看来显得极其简单、粗糙，但却拥有无尽的事物，甚至比整个天堂还多，主将其中的奥秘以无穷的多样性呈现在天使面前，直到永远。这在理性看来如此难以置信，以致它根本不愿意给予任何信任，但它却是真理。<br />这是一个神性真理：凡将功德置于善行，或为了名利和荣耀而行善之人，都不会因善行而在来世得到奖赏；凡出于真正良善的目的而做出恶事之人都不会因恶行而在来世受到惩罚；因为在来世，得到奖赏的是目的和来自目的的行为。这也是理性所无法相信的，但由于它是真理，所以理性是不能被信靠的，因为它通过外在事物，而非内在事物形成自己的结论。<br />这是一个神性真理：凡寻求来世最小喜乐的人都从主接受最大喜乐，凡寻求最大喜乐的人则只有最小的喜乐；而且，天堂的喜乐里面绝没有与胜过他人的优越感相关的任何元素。因为这类元素越存在，地狱就越存在；还有，天堂的喜乐里面没有一丝世俗荣耀的迹象。这些事在理性看来也是矛盾的，但它们应被相信，因为这些事是千真万确的。<br />这也是一个神性真理：人越相信智慧无一来自他自己，就越智慧；人越相信智慧来自他自己，因而越将正确的判断归于自己，就越愚蠢。对此，理性也是否认的。因为它以为凡不出于它自己的东西什么也不是。诸如此类的神性真理不计其数。仅从这几个例子就可以看出，不应信靠理性，因为理性沉浸在谬论（或幻觉）和表象中。因此，它拒绝摆脱谬论（或幻觉）和表象的真理，并且，它越拒绝，就越处在我欲及其欲望中，也处在推理或理论，以及有关信的谬念中（也可参看前面所举的例子，<a href="1911.htm">1911</a>节）。</p>

Return to thy mistress. That this signifies that it was observed that it ought not to trust to itself, but to interior truth and the affection of it, is evident from the signification of her "mistress," 
as being the affection of interior truth. But what is specially signified by "Sarai" (by Sarai as a "wife," and by Sarai as a "mistress") cannot be described, for it can be grasped by no idea; the 
things signified are, as before said, above the understanding, even that which is angelic. It is only suggested here how the Lord thought concerning the appearances that had engaged the attention of 
His first rational, namely, that they were not to be trusted, but Divine truths themselves, however incredible these might appear in the view of that rational. For such is the case with all truths Divine; 
if the rational be consulted respecting them, they cannot possibly be believed, for they surpass all its comprehension. For example: that no man, spirit, or angel, lives from himself, but the Lord 
only; and that the life of a man, spirit, or angel is an appearance of life in him; this is repugnant to the rational, which judges from fallacies, but still it is to be believed because it is the truth. 
 [2] It is a truth Divine that in every expression of the Word, which appears so simple and rude to man, there are things illimitable, nay, more than the universal heaven; and that the arcana which 
are therein may be presented before the angels by the Lord with perpetual variety to eternity. This is so incredible to the rational that it is unwilling to give it any credence at all; but still 
it is true.  [3] It is a truth Divine that no one is ever rewarded in the other life for good deeds, if he placed merit in them, or if he did them for the sake of gain, honor, and reputation; also that 
no one is ever punished for evil deeds if he acted from a truly good end; the ends being what are regarded, and from them the deeds. This too cannot be believed by the rational; but as it is true, 
the rational is not to be trusted, for it does not form its conclusions from internal things, but from external things.  [4] It is a truth Divine that he who aspires to the least joy in the other life, 
receives from the Lord the greatest, and that he who aspires to the greatest has the least, also that in heavenly joy there is never anything connected with being preeminent to others, and that in 
proportion as there is this, there is hell; also that in heavenly glory there is nothing whatever of worldly glory. These things also are repugnant to the rational, but still are to be believed, because 
they are true.  [5] It is also a truth Divine that the more anyone believes nothing of wisdom to be from himself, the wiser he is; and that the more he believes it to be from himself, and thus the 
more he attributes prudence to himself, the more insane he is. This also the rational denies, because it supposes that what is not from itself is nothing. There are innumerable such things. From these 
few examples it may be seen that the rational is not to be trusted; for the rational is in fallacies and appearances, and it therefore rejects truths that are stripped of fallacies and appearances; 
and it does this the more, the more it is in the love of self and its cupidities, and the more it is in reasonings, and also in false principles respecting faith. (See also the examples adduced above, 
n. 1911.) </p>

<p align="center"><b>Elliott(1983-1999) 1936</b></p><p><b>1936.</b>
'Return to your mistress' means that the reply indicated the first rational ought not to place trust in itself but in interior truth and the affection for it. This is clear from the meaning of 'mistress' 
as the affection for interior truth. As for the specific meanings of 'Sarai', 'wife Sarai', and 'mistress Sarai', these cannot be described as no ideas exist to make them intelligible. They are things 
that lie, as stated already, beyond the understanding even of angels. Here a mere intimation is given of the manner in which the Lord thought regarding the appearances which held the attention of 
His first rational - namely that no trust ought to be placed in such appearances but in Divine truths themselves, no matter how hard to believe these truths might appear to be to that rational. This 
is so with all Divine truths; that is, if the rational is consulted regarding those truths they cannot possibly be believed, for they transcend its whole range of understanding. Take for example the 
truth that no man, spirit, or angel, only the Lord, lives of himself, and that the life a man, spirit, or angel has is but an outward appearance of life with him. To the rational, which judges from illusions, 
this is repugnant; nevertheless it ought to be believed because it is the truth. </p>
<p></p>
<p><b>[2]</b>
 It is a Divine truth that in the Word every expression, which to man seems to be utterly simple and unwrought, 
possesses an incalculable number of facets, more in fact than the whole of heaven. And the arcana contained there can be displayed by the Lord to angels in unending variety continuing for ever. 
To the rational this is so hard to believe that it is never willing to give any credence to it. Nevertheless it is the truth.  </p>
<p></p>
<p><b>[3]</b>
 It is a Divine truth that nobody is ever rewarded in the next life 
for good deeds if he has set merit by them, and if he has done them for the sake of his own gain, position, and reputation. Nor is anyone ever punished for bad deeds if he has acted with a truly good 
end in view; for in the next life it is the ends that are regarded, and deeds in the light of those ends This too the rational is not able to believe, but because this which it does not believe is 
the truth, no trust should be placed in a rational which does not base its conclusions on internal things but on external. </p>
<p></p>
<p><b>[4]</b>
 It is a Divine truth that the one who seeks the least joy in the next 
life receives the greatest from the Lord, and the one who seeks the greatest has the least; also that within heavenly joy there is never any element of being pre-eminent over another, for insofar as such 
pre-eminence occurs hell is present; also that within heavenly glory there is not the least trace of worldly glory. These considerations too are repugnant to the rational; but they ought nevertheless 
to be believed because they are true. </p>
<p></p>
<p><b>[5]</b>
 It is also a Divine truth that the more someone believes that none of his wisdom originates in himself the wiser he is, and the more he believes it does 
originate there, and so attributes sound judgement to himself, the more stupid he is. This too the rational denies, for it supposes that what does not originate in itself is nothing. Countless Divine 
truths exist such as these few given as examples, which show that no trust should be placed in the rational, since the rational is immersed in illusions and appearances. It therefore rejects truths 
when these are stripped of illusions and appearances, all the more rejecting them the more that self-love and its desires are present, as well as reasonings, and false assumptions regarding faith. See 
also the examples presented above in <a href="1911.htm">1911</a>. </p>

Quod `revertere ad dominam' significet quod animadverterit se non fidere sibi debere sed vero interiori et ejus affectioni, constat a significatione `dominae' quod sit affectio veri interioris; sed 
quid in specie per `Sarai,' per `Sarai uxorem,' et per `Sarai dominam' significatur, non describi potest, quia nulla idea capi; sunt, ut dictum prius, supra intellectum etiam angelicum; hic modo innuitur 
quomodo Dominus cogitavit de apparentiis quae primum rationale apud Ipsum detinuerunt, nempe quod iis non fidendum, sed ipsis Veris Divinis, utcumque coram rationali illo {1}apparerent incredibilia: 
 ita se habet cum omnibus Veris Divinis; si consulitur de (c)illis rationale, nusquam possunt credi, nam superant omnem ejus captum, sicut pro exemplo, quod nullus {2}homo, spiritus et angelus vivat 
a semet, sed solus  Dominus, et quod vita {3}hominis, spiritus et angeli sit apparens vitae apud eos; hoc repugnat rationali, quod ex fallaciis judicat, sed usque credendum quia verum est.  [2] Verum 
Divinum est, quod indefinita sint in unaquavis voce Verbi, quae tam simplex et rudis apparet homini, immo quod plus quam universum caelum, (m)et quod arcana quae inibi, coram angelis a Domino sisti 
queant cum perpetua varietate in aeternum;(n) hoc tam incredibile est rationali ut nusquam aliquam fidem ei dare velit, sed usque est verum. [3] (t)Verum Divinum est, quod nusquam aliquis remuneretur 
in altera vita propter bene acta si meritum in illis posuerit, et si illa fecerit sui lucri, honoris et famae causa: et quod nusquam aliquis puniatur propter male acta si ex fine vere bono egerit, fines 
sunt qui spectantur,{4} inde acta; haec quoque a rationali non credi possunt, sed quia est verum, non fidendum rationali quod non ex internis sed ab externis concludit.  [4] Verum {5}Divinum est, qui 
minimum gaudium in altera vita affectat, quod is accipiat a Domino maximum, et qui maximum, is habeat minimum; tum quod in gaudio caelesti nusquam sit aliquid praeeminentiae prae altero, et quantum 
praeeminentiae, tantum inferni; (m)tum quod in gloria caelesti ne minimum gloriae mundanae sit(n); haec quoque rationali repugnant, sed usque credenda quia sunt vera.  [5] (m)Verum quoque Divinum est 
quod quis eo sapientior sit, quo plus credit quod nihil sapientiae a se, et quod eo insanior, (x)quo plus credit a se, ita quo plus prudentiam sibi ipsi tribuit; rationale hoc quoque negat, quia quod 
non ex se, putat esse nihil: talia dantur {6}innumerabilia, ex illis ut paucis exemplis constare {7}potest quod non fidendum rationali, nam rationale est in fallaciis et apparentiis, quare vera fallaciis 
et apparentiis nudata rejicit, et eo magis, quo plus in amore sui et ejus cupiditatibus est, {8}inque ratiociniis, tum in principiis falsi de fide.  Videantur etiam quae supra allata n. 1911. @1
