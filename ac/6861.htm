<h4 align="center"></h4><p><strong>6861.</strong>出埃及记3:9-12.现在，看哪，以色列人的哀声达到我这里，我也看见埃及人对他们所施的压迫。现在你去，我要差你到法老那里，使你可以将我的百姓以色列人从埃及领出来。摩西对神说，我是谁，竟能到法老那里，将以色列人从埃及领出来呢？祂说，我必与你同在；这就是我差遣了你，给你的凭据：你将百姓从埃及领出来之后，你们必在这山附近事奉我。<br />“现在，看哪，以色列人的哀声达到我这里”表对那些属于属灵教会之人的怜悯。“我也看见埃及人对他们所施的压迫”表由于那些陷入虚假的人征服他们的努力。“现在你去，我要差你到法老那里”表从主的人身发出的神圣，发出的神圣将驱散侵扰的虚假。“使你可以将我的百姓以色列人从埃及领出来”表随之那些属于属灵教会的人从侵扰的虚假当中所获得的解救。“摩西对神说”表从神性和谦卑所领受的觉知。“我是谁，竟能到法老那里”表他尚未处于这样一种状态：他觉得自己能面对并除去侵扰的虚假。“将以色列人领出来呢”表并因此解救那些属于属灵教会的人。“祂说，我必与你同在”表神性将在人身里面。“这就是我差遣了你，给你的凭据”表对神性从祂自己发出的认识。“你将百姓从埃及领出来之后”表当那些属灵人从虚假的侵扰中被解救出来时。“你们必在这山附近事奉我”表那时对源于爱的神性的觉知和承认。</p>

Verses 9-12. And now behold the cry of the sons of Israel is come unto Me, and I have also seen the oppression wherewith the Egyptians oppress them. And now go, and I will send thee unto Pharaoh, and 
do thou bring forth My people the sons of Israel out of Egypt. And Moses said unto God, Who am I that I should go unto Pharaoh, and that I should bring forth the sons of Israel out of Egypt? And he said, 
Because I will be with thee; and this shall be the sign to thee that I have sent thee: when thou hast brought forth the people out of Egypt, ye shall worship God near this mountain. "And now behold 
the cry of the sons of Israel is come unto Me," signifies pity for those who are of the spiritual church; "and I have also seen the oppression wherewith the Egyptians oppress them," signifies by reason 
of the endeavor of subjugation by those who were in falsities; "and now go, and I will send thee unto Pharaoh," signifies the holy proceeding from the Lord's Human, by which the infesting falsities 
would be dispersed; "and do thou bring forth My people the sons of Israel out of Egypt," signifies the consequent liberation of those who were of the spiritual church from infesting falsities; "and 
Moses said unto God," signifies perception from the Divine and humiliation; "who am I that I should go unto Pharaoh?" signifies not being yet in such a state as to seem to himself to be able to go to 
and remove the infesting falsities; "and that I should bring forth the sons of Israel?" signifies and thus to liberate those of the spiritual church; "and He said, Because I will be with thee," signifies 
that the Divine will be in the Human; "and this shall be the sign to thee that I have sent thee," signifies the knowledge that the Divine proceeded from Himself; "when thou has brought forth the 
people out of Egypt," signifies when the spiritual are liberated from infestation by falsities; "ye shall worship God near this mountain," signifies then perception and acknowledgment of the Divine from love. </p>

Verses 9-12 And now, behold, the cry of the children of Israel has come to Me; and also I have seen the oppression with which the Egyptians oppress them. And now, go, and I will send you to Pharaoh; 
and lead My people the children of Israel out of Egypt. And Moses said to God, Who am I that I should go to Pharaoh, and that I should lead the children of Israel out of Egypt? And He said, Because I 
will be with you; and this will be the sign to you that I have sent you: When you lead the people out of Egypt you shall worship God beside this mountain. </p>
<p>'And now, behold, the cry of the children 
of Israel has come to Me' means compassion on those belonging to the spiritual Church. 'And also I have seen the oppression with which the Egyptians oppress them' means because of the endeavour by those 
steeped in falsities to bring them into subjection. 'And now, go, I will send you to Pharaoh' means the Holy influence going forth from the Lord's Human, by which molesting falsities would be dispelled. 
'And lead My people the children of Israel out of Egypt' means the consequent deliverance of those belonging to the spiritual Church from molesting falsities. 'And Moses said to God' means perception 
received from the Divine, and a state of humility. 'Who am I that I should go to Pharaoh?' means that he had not yet arrived at the kind of state in which it seemed to him that he was able to face 
molesting falsities and remove them from himself. 'And that I should lead the children of Israel out' means and so deliver those belonging to the spiritual Church. 'And He said, Because I will be with 
you' means that the Divine would be within the Human. 'And this will be the sign to you that I have sent you' means the recognition that the Divine would go forth from Him. 'When you lead the people 
out of Egypt' means when those who were spiritual had been delivered from molestation by falsities. 'You shall worship God beside this mountain' means a perception and acknowledgement of the Divine 
springing from love. </p>

Vers. 9-12.  Et nunc ecce clamor filiorum Israelis venit ad Me, et etiam vidi oppressionem qua Aegyptii opprimunt illos.  Et nunc ito, et mittam te ad Pharaonem, et educ populum Meum filios Israelis 
ex Aegypto.  Et dixit Moscheh ad Deum, Quis ego quod eam ad Pharaonem, et quod educam filios Israelis ex Aegypto?  Et dixit, Quia ero cum te; et hoc tibi signum quod Ego miserim te, in educendo te populum 
ex Aegypto, coletis Deum juxta montem hunc. `Et nunc ecce clamor filiorum Israelis venit ad Me' significat miserationem super illos qui ab Ecclesia spirituali: `et etiam vidi oppressionem (x)qua 
Aegyptii opprimunt illos' significat propter subjugationis conatum ab illis qui in falsis: et nunc ito, et mittam te ad Pharaonem' significat Sanctum procedens ab Humano Domini, quo falsa infestantia 
dissiparentur: `et educ populum Meum filios Israelis ex Aegypto' significat inde liberationem illorum qui ab Ecclesia spirituali a falsis infestantibus: `et dixit Moscheh ad Deum' significat perceptionem 
a Divino, et humiliationem: `Quis ego quod eam ad Pharaonem?' significat quod nondum in tali statu ut falsa infestantia adire et removere sibi posse videretur: `et quod educam filios Israelis' significat 
et sic liberare illos qui ab Ecclesia spirituali: `et dixit, Quia ero cum te' significat quod Divinum in Humano: `et hoc tibi signum quod Ego miserim te' significat cognitionem quod Divinum procederet 
ab Ipso: `in educendo te populum ex Aegypto' significat cum spirituales ex infestatione a falsis liberati sunt: `coletis Deum juxta montem hunc' significat tunc perceptionem et agnitionem Divini 
ex amore. </p>
