<h4 align="center"></h4><p><strong>1238.</strong>“希伯”也表一个民族，这个民族的先祖是希伯，他就叫这个名字。这一点要这样来理解：目前所提及的这些人是指存在古教会的民族，他们全都被称作闪、含、雅弗和迦南的儿子，因为“闪、含、雅弗、迦南”表这个教会的各种敬拜。挪亚、闪、含、雅弗和迦南从来就不是真实的人物；但由于具体的古教会和总体的每个教会都具有这样的特点，即它包括纯正的内在、败坏的内在，以及纯正的外在、败坏的外在，故经上采用上述名字是为了一切差异一般情况下能与这些人物及其子孙，以至于他们的首领发生联系。而且，此处提及的这些民族一开始拥有这类敬拜，因此被视为挪亚其中一个儿子的子孙。在圣言中，这些民族还表这类敬拜本身。<br />挪亚和他的儿子所表示的第一代古教会并非局限于少数人，而是遍及很多国家（从所提及的这些民族就能清楚看出来），如亚述、美索不达米亚、叙利亚、埃塞俄比亚、阿尔巴尼亚、利比亚、埃及、腓利士，直到推罗和西顿，还延及整个迦南陆地，约旦河两侧。后来，叙利亚兴起一种外在敬拜，传播甚广，遍及很多国家，尤其盛行于迦南地区。这种敬拜形式不同于古教会的。由于一个教会的某种事物从古教会分离出来，以这种方式产生，故可以说一个新教会从它兴起，这个新教会可称作第二代古教会。由于希伯是它的第一个创始人，故该教会就以希伯为名。如前所述，那个时代，所有人都被划分为家庭、宗族、民族。一个民族认一位先祖，还以他命名，这可见于圣言各个地方。因此，认希伯为其先祖的这个民族就被称作希伯来民族。</p>

<p><strong>[NCE]1238.</strong> In regard to the fact that Eber too means a nation — one whose ancestor was Eber, an individual called by that name — the case is this: The names mentioned so far were nations among whom the ancient church was present. All of them were called children of Shem, Ham, Japheth, or Canaan because Shem, Ham, Japheth, and Canaan symbolized dissimilar cultures in the church. Noah, Shem, Ham, Japheth, and Canaan themselves never existed. But the ancient church in particular (like every religion in general) by its very nature had genuine depths, corrupt depths, genuine externals, and corrupt externals. That is why these names came into being: so that all the different general types could be categorized under the headings represented by these individuals and their offspring.<br />At their outset, the nations named here also practiced the kind of worship [symbolized by each]. That is why they are called the children of one of Noah's sons, and it is why the names of these nations in the Word symbolize the different cultures themselves.<br />[2] This first ancient church — the one that Noah and his sons symbolize — did not exist among only a few people but spread out through many countries. One indication is the number of nations mentioned: Assyria, Mesopotamia, Syria, Ethiopia, Arabia, Libya, Egypt, Philistia as far as Tyre and Sidon, and the whole land of Canaan on both the far and the near sides of the Jordan.<br />Afterward, though, a certain shallow kind of worship took hold in Syria, and it eventually spread far and wide through many lands (especially in Canaan). It was at variance with the worship of the ancient church, and since its existence constituted the start of something like a church distinct and separate from the ancient church, a seemingly new church now arose, which can therefore be called the second ancient church. The founder was Eber, so the religion was named after him.<br />At that period people were all divided into households, clans, and nations, as already noted [<a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_1238/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_470" target=_top>470-471</a>, <a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_1238/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_483#subsection-2-2" target=_top>483:2</a>, <a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_1238/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_1159#subsection-2-3" target=_top>1159:3</a>]. Each nation acknowledged one father, for whom it was named, as the Word demonstrates throughout. So the nation that acknowledged Eber as its father was called the Hebrew nation. </p>
<p align="center"><b>Potts(1905-1910) 1238</b></p><p><b>1238.</b>
That by "Eber" is signified a nation also, whose father was Eber, one who was called by this name, is to be understood in this way. Those mentioned hitherto were the nations among whom the Ancient Church 
existed, and were all called sons of Shem, of Ham, of Japheth, and of Canaan, because by Shem, Ham, Japheth, and Canaan are signified the various worships of the church. Noah, Shem, Ham, Japheth, 
and Canaan never existed as men; but because the Ancient Church specifically, and in general every church, is such that it is true internal, corrupt internal, true external, and corrupt external, therefore 
the above-mentioned names were given in order that all the differences in general might be referred to them and their sons, as to their heads. Moreover the nations here named originally had such 
worship; and therefore are called the sons of one of the sons of Noah. And for the same reason also, such worships themselves are signified by the names of these nations in the Word.  [2] This first 
Ancient Church, signified by Noah and his sons, was not confined to a few, but extended over many kingdoms, as is evident from the nations mentioned, namely, Assyria, Mesopotamia, Syria, Ethiopia, Arabia, 
Lybia, Egypt, Philistia as far as Tyre and Sidon, and the whole land of Canaan, on this side and beyond Jordan. But afterwards in Syria a kind of external worship began, which from thence spread 
itself widely around, over many countries, especially over Canaan, and which was different from the worship of the Ancient Church. And as something of a church thus arose that was separate from the 
Ancient Church, there sprang up thence as it were a new church, which may therefore be called the Second Ancient Church. The first institutor of this was Eber, and therefore this church is called after 
Eber. At that time, as has been said before, all were distinguished into households, families, and nations. Each nation acknowledged one father, from whom also it was named, as is seen in various places 
in the Word. Thus the nation which acknowledged Eber as its father was called the Hebrew nation.  </p>

<p align="center"><b>Elliott(1983-1999) 1238</b></p><p><b>1238.</b>
As for Eber meaning a nation as well, whose father was thus named Eber, the position is this: Those named so far were nations with whom the Ancient Church existed. All of them were called sons of Shem, 
Ham, Japheth, or Canaan, because 'Shem, Ham, Japheth, and Canaan' meant differing types of worship in the Church. Noah, Shem, Ham, Japheth, and Canaan never were actual people, but because the Ancient 
Church in particular was such, and every Church in general is such, that it includes a true internal, a corrupted internal, a true external, and a corrupted external, these names were therefore adopted 
so that all differences in general could be related to those characters and their sons as to their heads. The nations named here also at first possessed such worship, for which reason they are called 
the sons of one of Noah's sons, and also such forms of worship themselves are meant by the names of these nations in the Word. </p>
<p></p>
<p><b>[2]</b>
 This first Ancient Church meant by Noah and his sons was not 
confined to a few people but was spread throughout many kingdoms, as is clear from the nations mentioned - throughout Assyria, Mesopotamia, Syria, Ethiopia, Arabia, Libya, Egypt, Philistia up to Tyre 
and Sidon, and throughout the whole of the land of Canaan, on this side of the Jordan and on the other side. Subsequently however a certain type of external worship started in Syria which spread far 
and wide from there and through many countries, particularly Canaan. It was a different form of worship from the worship of the Ancient Church. And because something of a Church arose in this way that 
was separate from the Ancient Church, a new Church so to speak rose up from it which may therefore be called the second Ancient Church. Eber was its first founder, and therefore this Church took its 
name from Eber. As stated already, everybody at that time was distinguished into separate houses, families, and nations. One nation recognized one father from whom it also took its name, as is clear throughout 
the Word, the nation which recognized Eber as its father thus being called the Hebrew nation. </p>

Quod per 'Eberum' significetur quoque gens, cujus pater fuit Eberus, ita nomine vocatus, ita se res habet:  qui hactenus nominati sunt, fuerunt gentes apud quas Antiqua Ecclesia fuit, quae omnes dictae 
fuerunt filii Shemi, Hami, Japheti, Canaanis, quia per 'Shemum, Hamum, Japhetum, Canaanem' significati sunt diversi cultus Ecclesiae:  Noahus, Shemus, Hamus, Japhetus, Canaan nusquam fuerunt, sed 
quia Antiqua Ecclesia in specie talis fuit, et omnis Ecclesia in genere talis est, ut sit interna vera, interna corrupta, externa vera, et externa corrupta, ideo haec nomina, ut omnes differentiae in 
genere ad illos et filios illorum, ut ad sua capita, referri possent:  gentes hic nominatae etiam primitus habuerunt talem cultum, et ideo dictae sunt filii unius filiorum Noahi, et ideo etiam ipsi cultus 
tales per nomina harum gentium in Verbo significantur.  [2]Antiqua haec Ecclesia prima per 'Noahum et ejus filios' significata, non intra paucos fuit, sed extensa per plura regna, ut constat a gentibus 
nominatis, nempe per Assyriam, Mesopotamiam, Syriam, Aethiopiam, Arabiam, Lybiam, Aegyptum, Philistaeam usque ad Tyrum et Zidonem, per totam terram Canaanem trans Jordanem et cis Jordanem.  Sed 
postea in Syria incepit cultus quidam externus, qui deinde late se circumfudit, et quidem per plures terras, imprimis per Canaanem qui cultus diversus fuit a cultu Antiquae Ecclesiae; et quia sic ortum 
fuit quoddam Ecclesiae, quod separatum ab Ecclesia Antiqua, inde nova quasi Ecclesia exsurrexit, quam ideo vocare licet alteram Ecclesiam Antiquam; Eberus fuit primus ejus institutor, quare Ecclesia 
haec ab Ebero vocata est.  Illo tempore fuerunt omnes distincti in domos, familias et gentes, ut prius dictum; una gens agnoscebat unum patrem, e quo etiam nominabatur, ut a Verbo passim constat, ita 
gens quae Eberum agnoscebat ut patrem suum, gens Hebraea vocata est. </p>
