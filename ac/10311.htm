<h4 align="center"></h4><p>星空之外的第三个星球<br /><strong>10311</strong>.一些不愿走近的灵人在远处出现，因为他们不能与当时在我周围的地球灵在一起。我由此意识到，他们来自另一个星球；后来被告知，他们来自宇宙中的某个星球。至于这个星球在哪里，我没有被告知。</p>

ON THE THIRD EARTH IN THE STARRY HEAVEN. There appeared spirits from afar who were not willing to come near, for the reason that they could not be with the spirits of our earth who were then about me. 
From this I perceived that they were from another earth, and I was afterward told that they were from a certain earth in the universe; but where that earth is, was not told me. </p>

THE THIRD PLANET OUT IN SPACE  </p>
<p>Spirits from a long way off appeared who were unwilling to come near, for the reason that they could not be present with the spirits belonging to our planet who were 
around me at that time. From this I realized that they were from another planet; and subsequently I was told that they were from some planet out in the universe. But where that planet is situated was 
not made known to me.  </p>

De Tertia Tellure in Caelo Astrifero </p>
<p>Apparebant spiritus e longinquo qui non appropinquare volebant; causa erat quia non simul potuerunt esse cum (x)spiritibus nostrae telluris qui circum me tunc 
erant; inde percepi quod ex alia tellure essent; et postea mihi dictum est quod ex tellure quadam in universo; sed ubi illa tellus, non mihi indicatum est. </p>
