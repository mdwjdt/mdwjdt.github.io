<h3 align="center" class="ired">属天的奥秘 第4007节</h3>
<h4 align="center"></h4><p><strong>4007.</strong>“有杂白纹的（母山羊）”表真理。这从“白”的含义清楚可知，“白”是指真理，严格来说，是指主的公义和功德，由此而指主在人里面的公义和功德（<a href="3301.htm">3301</a>，<a href="3993.htm">3993</a>节）。“白”之所以具有这种含义，是因为从主放射、为亮而白之源头的天堂之光表示真理。因此，凡被这光光照、变得闪亮而光辉之物都被称为主在人里面的公义和功德。那些出于良善承认并接受主的公义，并弃绝自己的公义之人尤以“义人”来表示，主在马太福音论到他们说：<br />义人在他们父的国里，要发出光来，像太阳一样。（马太福音<a href="http://39-27.cn/太13.43.htm">13:43</a>）<br />闪亮而光辉的“白”具有这种含义的事实也可从圣言中的其它经文明显看出来，如摩西五经：<br />他的眼睛比酒红润；他的牙齿比奶洁白。（创世记<a href="http://39-27.cn/创49.12.htm">49:12</a>）<br />这论及犹大，他代表主的爱之神性，在内义上代表属天国度，因而代表属天之人（参看<a href="3881.htm">3881</a>节）。“眼睛比酒红润”表示神性智慧，“牙齿比奶洁白”表示神性公义。诗篇：<br />求你用牛膝草洁净我，我就干净；求你洗涤我，我就比雪更白。（诗篇<a href="http://39-27.cn/诗51.7.htm">51:7</a>）<br />“洗涤”和“比雪更白”表示通过接受并披上主的公义而从罪中洁净。启示录：<br />七灯台中间有一位好像人子；祂的头与发皆白，如白羊毛、如雪，眼目如同火焰。（启示录<a href="http://39-27.cn/启1.13.htm">1:13</a>-<a href="http://39-27.cn/启1.14.htm">14</a>）<br /><br />在撒狄，你还有几个名字是未曾污秽自己衣服的；他们要穿白衣与我同行，因为他们是配得过的。凡得胜的，必这样穿白衣。（启示录<a href="http://39-27.cn/启3.4.htm">3:4</a>-<a href="http://39-27.cn/启3.5.htm">5</a>）<br /><br />我劝你向我买火炼的金子，叫你富足；又买白衣穿上。（启示录<a href="http://39-27.cn/启3.18.htm">3:18</a>）<br /><br />有白袍赐给在祭坛底下的一切灵魂。（启示录<a href="http://39-27.cn/启6.9.htm">6:9</a>-<a href="http://39-27.cn/启6.11.htm">11</a>）<br /><br />我见他们站在宝座和羔羊面前，披着白袍。长老中有一位回应我说，这些披着白袍的是谁？是从哪里来的？我对他说，我主，你知道。他向我说，这些人是从大苦难中出来的，曾把他们的袍子洗了，用羔羊的血使他们的袍子洁白。（启示录<a href="http://39-27.cn/启7.9.htm">7:9</a>，<a href="http://39-27.cn/启7.13.htm">13</a>-<a href="http://39-27.cn/启7.14.htm">14</a>）<br /><br />那七位天使穿着洁白光明的细麻衣，胸间束着金带。（启示录<a href="http://39-27.cn/启15.6.htm">15:6</a>）<br /><br />我就观看，见有一匹白马；骑在马上的拿着弓，并有冠冕赐给他。（启示录<a href="http://39-27.cn/启6.2.htm">6:2</a>）<br /><br />我看见天开了，见有一匹白马。在天上的众军骑着白马，穿着细麻衣，又白又洁，跟随祂。（启示录<a href="http://39-27.cn/启19.11.htm">19:11</a>，<a href="http://39-27.cn/启19.14.htm">14</a>）<br />在所有这些经文中，“白”表示信之真理，“白衣”和“白袍”也没有其它含义。不过，信之真理并不属于那些以为他们凭自己有信仰，因而靠自己有智慧的人，而属于那些相信他们靠主有信仰和智慧的人，信仰和智慧就被赐予这些人，因为他们根本不将任何真理或良善归于自己，更不认为他们通过自己所拥有的真理和良善而有功德；尤其不认为他们由此而称义；而是把这些都归于主，从而将一切事物归于主的恩典和怜悯。这就是“披着白袍”，以及“因羔羊的血变得洁白”的意思。凡进入天堂者都会丢弃两样东西，即他们的自我和随之而来的自信，以及自我的功德或自我公义。他们会披上出自主的天堂自我，以及主的功德或公义。他们越是披上这些，就越深地进入天堂。这两样东西尤以“红”和“白”来表示；“红”表示那时他们所拥有的爱之良善；“白”表示信之真理。</p>

Every one that had white in it. That this signifies in which there is truth, is evident from the signification of "white," as being truth, but properly the Lord's righteousness and merit, and derivatively 
the Lord's righteousness and merit in man (see n. 3301, 3993). The reason why "white" has this signification, is that the light of heaven, which is from the Lord and is the source of brightness 
and whiteness, signifies truth; and therefore that which is enlightened by that light, and becomes shining and bright, is that which is called the Lord's righteousness and merit in man. They who from 
good acknowledge and receive the Lord's righteousness, and reject their own righteousness, are they who are specifically signified by "righteous," concerning whom the Lord says in Matthew: </p>
<p>     The righteous 
shall shine as the sun in the kingdom of their Father (Matt. 13:43). [2] That "shining or bright white" has this signification, is evident also from other passages in the Word; as in Moses: </p>
<p> 
    His eyes shall be redder than wine, and his teeth whiter than milk (Gen. 49:12); </p>
<p>speaking of Judah, by whom is represented the Lord as to the Divine of His love; and in the internal sense, the 
celestial kingdom; and thus the celestial man (as may be seen above, n. 3881). The "eyes being redder than wine" signifies the Divine wisdom; and the "teeth whiter than milk," the Divine righteousness. 
In David: </p>
<p>     Thou shalt purify me with hyssop, and I shall be clean; Thou shalt wash me, and I shall be whiter than snow (Ps. 51:7); </p>
<p>"to wash," and "to be made whiter than snow," denotes to be purified 
from sins by the reception and putting on of the Lord's righteousness. In John: </p>
<p>     In the midst of the seven candlesticks was one like unto the Son of man; His head and His hairs were white 
as white wool, as snow; and His eyes were as a flame of fire (Rev. 1:13-14). [3] In the same: </p>
<p>     Thou hast a few names in Sardis who have not defiled their garments, and they shall walk with Me in 
white, for they are worthy. He that overcometh shall be clothed in white garments (Rev. 3:4-5). In the same: </p>
<p>     I counsel thee to buy of Me gold purified in the fire, that thou mayest be rich; and 
white garments that thou mayest be clothed (Rev. 3:18). Again: </p>
<p>     There were given to every soul under the altar white robes (Rev. 6:9-11). Again: </p>
<p>     I saw them standing before the throne, 
and before the Lamb, arrayed in white robes. And one of the elders said unto me, Who are these clothed in white robes? And whence came they? And I said unto him, My lord, thou knowest. And he said unto 
me, These are they who come out of the great tribulation, and have washed their robes, and have made their robes white in the blood of the lamb (Rev. 7:9, 13-14). Again: </p>
<p>     Angels clothed in linen 
white and shining, and girt about their breasts with golden girdles (Rev. 15:6). Again: </p>
<p>     I saw and behold a white horse, and he that sat thereon had a bow, and there was given unto him a crown 
(Rev. 6:2). And again: </p>
<p>     Afterwards I saw heaven opened, and behold a white horse. His armies in heaven followed Him upon white horses, clothed in fine linen white and clean (Rev. 19:11, 14). [4] 
In all these passages by "white" is signified the truth of faith; the "white garments" and "white robes" being nothing else. But the truth of faith does not belong to those who believe that they have 
faith of themselves, and thus are wise from themselves; but to those who believe they have faith and wisdom from the Lord, for to these are faith and wisdom given because they ascribe nothing of truth 
and good to themselves, still less believe that they have merit through the truths and goods they possess; and less still that they are justified thereby; but only by ascribing them to the Lord; 
thus all things to His grace and mercy. This is "putting on white garments;" and is also "being made white in the blood of the Lamb." There are two things that are put off by all who enter into heaven, 
namely, their own and the consequent confidence, and the merit of self or of their own righteousness; and they put on a heavenly own which is from the Lord, and the Lord's merit or righteousness; and 
the more they put on these, the more interiorly do they come into heaven. These two things are specifically signified by "red" and by "white;" by "red," the good of love which they then have; and by 
"white," the truth of faith. </p>

<p align="center"><b>Elliott(1983-1999) 4007</b></p><p><b>4007.</b>
'Every one that had white in it' means that which has truth in it. This is clear from the meaning of 'white' as truth, but strictly speaking as the Lord's Righteousness and Merit, and from this the Lord's 
righteousness and merit as these exist with man, dealt with in <a href="3301.htm">3301</a>, <a href="3993.htm">3993</a>. 'White' has that meaning because the light of heaven which radiates from the Lord, a light which is the source of splendour 
and brightness, means truth. Anything therefore on which that light falls and is made splendid and bright is that which is called the Lord's righteousness and merit existing with man. Those who acknowledge 
this, the Lord's righteousness, and who from good take it to themselves and reject their own, are specifically the ones meant by 'the righteous' whom the Lord refers to, in Matthew, </p>
<blockquote>
The 
righteous will shine like the sun in the kingdom of their Father. <a href="http://bible.gospelcom.net/cgi-bin/bible?passage=Matt%2013:43&amp;version=ESV&amp;interface=print&amp;showfn=yes&amp;showxref">Matt 13:43</a>. 
</blockquote>
<p></p>
<p><b>[2]</b>
 The fact that that which is 'white', being splendid and bright, has this meaning is also evident from other places 
in the Word, as in Moses, </p>
<blockquote>
His eyes will be redder than wine, and his teeth whiter than milk. <a href="http://bible.gospelcom.net/cgi-bin/bible?passage=Gen%2049:12&amp;version=ESV&amp;interface=print&amp;showfn=yes&amp;showxref">Gen 49:12</a>. 
</blockquote>
<p>This refers to Judah, who represents the Lord as regards the Divinity of His Love, and in 
the internal sense the celestial kingdom, and so the celestial man, see <a href="3881.htm">3881</a>. 'Eyes redder than wine' means Divine Wisdom, and 'teeth whiter than milk' means Righteousness. In David, </p>
<blockquote>
You will purify 
me with hyssop and I shall be clean; You will wash me, and I shall become whiter than snow. <a href="http://bible.gospelcom.net/cgi-bin/bible?passage=Ps%2051:7&amp;version=ESV&amp;interface=print&amp;showfn=yes&amp;showxref">Ps 51:7</a>. 
</blockquote>
<p>'Washing and becoming whiter than snow' stands for being purified from sins by means of receiving 
and putting on the Lord's righteousness. In John, </p>
<blockquote>
In the midst of the seven lampstands one like the Son of Man. His head and hair were white, like white wool, like snow; and his eyes were like 
a flame of fire. <a href="http://bible.gospelcom.net/cgi-bin/bible?passage=Rev%201:13,%2014&amp;version=ESV&amp;interface=print&amp;showfn=yes&amp;showxref">Rev 1:13, 14</a>. 
</blockquote>

<p><b>[3]</b>
 In the same book, </p>
<blockquote>
You have a few names in Sardis, who have not soiled their garments, and they will walk with Me in white, for they are worthy. He who conquers 
will be clad in white garments. <a href="http://bible.gospelcom.net/cgi-bin/bible?passage=Rev%203:4,%205&amp;version=ESV&amp;interface=print&amp;showfn=yes&amp;showxref">Rev 3:4, 5</a>. 
</blockquote>
<p>In the same book, </p>
<blockquote>
I counsel you to buy from Me gold purified in fire, that you may be rich, and white garments to clothe you. <a href="http://bible.gospelcom.net/cgi-bin/bible?passage=Rev%203:18&amp;version=ESV&amp;interface=print&amp;showfn=yes&amp;showxref">Rev 3:18</a>.

<p>In the

<blockquote>
To each soul under the altar were given white robes. <a href="http://bible.gospelcom.net/cgi-bin/bible?passage=Rev%206:9,%2011&amp;version=ESV&amp;interface=print&amp;showfn=yes&amp;showxref">Rev 6:9, 11</a>. 
</blockquote>
<p>In the same book, </p>
<blockquote>
I saw, standing before the throne and before the Lamb those clothed in white robes. One of the 
elders said to me, These clothed in white robes - who are they, and where have they come from? I said to him, Sir, you know. He said to me, These are they who are coming out of the great tribulation, 
and have washed their robes, and have made their robes white in the blood of the Lamb. <a href="http://bible.gospelcom.net/cgi-bin/bible?passage=Rev%207:9,%2013,%2014&amp;version=ESV&amp;interface=print&amp;showfn=yes&amp;showxref">Rev 7:9, 13, 14</a> 
</blockquote>
<p>In the same book, </p>
<blockquote>
The angels were clothed in linen, white and splendid, and were girded 
around their breasts with golden girdles. <a href="http://bible.gospelcom.net/cgi-bin/bible?passage=Rev%2015:6&amp;version=ESV&amp;interface=print&amp;showfn=yes&amp;showxref">Rev 15:6</a>.

<p>In the same book, </p>
<blockquote>
I saw, and behold, a white horse, and he who sat on it had a bow; to him a crown was given. <a href="http://bible.gospelcom.net/cgi-bin/bible?passage=Rev%206:2&amp;version=ESV&amp;interface=print&amp;showfn=yes&amp;showxref">Rev 6:2</a>.

<p>And elsewhere, </p>

After 
this I saw heaven opened, and behold, a white horse. His armies in heaven were following Him on white horses and were clothed in linen white and clean. <a href="http://bible.gospelcom.net/cgi-bin/bible?passage=Rev%2019:11,%2014&amp;version=ESV&amp;interface=print&amp;showfn=yes&amp;showxref">Rev 19:11, 14</a>.

<p><b>[4]</b>
 In all these places 
'white' means the truth of faith; 'white garments' and 'white robes' have no other meaning. But the truth of faith does not exist with any who believe that they have faith of themselves and so believe 
that they are wise of themselves. Rather, it exists with those who believe that their faith and wisdom come from the Lord, for faith and wisdom are imparted to them because they do not ascribe any 
truth or good at all to themselves. Even less do they believe that they possess any merit through the truths and goods residing with them, and less still any righteousness, but only by ascribing these 
to the Lord, and so everything to His grace and mercy. This is what 'putting on white garments' means, and also what 'being made white in the blood of the Lamb' means. There are two things which all 
who enter heaven cast aside, namely their proprium and consequent confidence, and merit that is their own or self-righteousness. Then they assume a heavenly proprium which comes from the Lord, and the 
Lord's merit or righteousness. And to the extent that these are so assumed those persons advance further into heaven. These two things specifically are meant by 'red' and by 'white'; 'red' means the 
good of love and is present with those people at that time, 'white' the truth of faith. </p>

`Omne in quo album': quod significet in quo verum, constat ex significatione `albi' quod sit verum, proprie autem Justitia et Meritum Domini, et inde justitia et meritum Domini apud hominem, de qua 
{1}n. 3301, 3993; quod `album' sit illud, est quia lux caeli quae a Domino, ex qua luce splendor et candor, significat verum; </p>

<p>quod album splendens seu candidum sit illud, patet etiam ex aliis, locis in Verbo, ut apud

caeleste, ita homo caelestis, videatur n. 3881; `ruber oculis {4}prae vino' significat Divinam Sapientiam, `albus dentibus {4}prae lacte' significat Justitiam: apud Davidem,      Purificabis 
me hyssopo, et mundabor; lavabis me, et prae nive      albus fiam, Ps li 9 [A.V. 7]; </p>
