<h3 align="center" class="ired">属天的奥秘 第5195节</h3>
<h4 align="center"></h4><p><strong>5195.</strong>“法老作梦”表为属世层所作的提供。这从“法老”的代表和“作梦”的含义清楚可知：“法老”是指属世层（参看<a href="5079.htm">5079</a>，<a href="5080.htm">5080</a>，<a href="5095.htm">5095</a>，<a href="5160.htm">5160</a>节）；“作梦”是指对将要到来之事的预言，因而在至高意义上是指预见（<a href="3698.htm">3698</a>，<a href="4682.htm">4682</a>，<a href="5091.htm">5091</a>，<a href="5092.htm">5092</a>，<a href="5104.htm">5104</a>节）。由于所表示的是预见或预见的事，故也表示提供，或提供的事，因为预见和提供不能一个没有另一个而存在。事实上，提供关注持续到永远的状态；但除非预见该状态是什么，否则它就无法对它作出任何提供。为当前需求提供，同时没有对未来需求的任何预见，因而没有同时为当前需求里面的未来需求提供，就意味着没有任何目的，没有次序，因而没有智慧和聪明，因而不是源于神性。提供论及良善，预见论及非良善（<a href="5155.htm">5155</a>节）。预见无法论及良善，因为良善居于神性里面，从神性本身并照着它出现；其实它能论及非良善和邪恶；因为非良善和邪恶在神性之外出现，来自与神性相反的其他人。因此，提供因论及良善，故也论及属世层与属灵层的属天层的结合，该结合就是本章所论述的主题。这就是为何“作梦”在此表示所作的提供的原因。</p>

And Pharaoh dreamed. That this signifies what was provided in regard to the natural, is evident from the representation of Pharaoh, as being the natural (see n. 5079, 5080, 5095, 5160); and from the 
signification of "dreaming," as being a prediction of things to come, thus in the supreme sense foresight (n. 3698, 4682, 5091, 5092, 5104); and because it is foresight, or what is foreseen, it is also 
providence or what is provided, as the one does not exist without the other. For providence has regard to the state in its successions to eternity, which cannot be provided for unless foreseen. To make 
provision for what is present, and not at the same time to foresee what is to come, and so not to make provision for the future during the present, would be without end, without order, and consequently 
without wisdom and intelligence, thus not from the Divine. Providence is predicated of good, and foresight of what is not good (n. 5155). Foresight cannot be predicated of good, because good is 
in the Divine, and comes into existence from the Divine Itself and according to it; but it can be predicated of what is not good and what is evil; for this comes into existence outside of the Divine, 
and is from others who are contrary to the Divine. Thus as providence is said of good, it is said also of the conjunction of the natural with the celestial of the spiritual, which conjunction is treated 
of in this chapter; and therefore by "dreaming" is here signified what is provided. </p>

'That Pharaoh was dreaming' means provision<A name="fntext1"></a><A href="#fn1"><sup>a</sup></a> made for the natural. This is clear from the representation of 'Pharaoh' as the natural, dealt with in <a href="5079.htm">5079</a>, <a href="5080.htm">5080</a>, <a href="5095.htm">5095</a>, <a href="5160.htm">5160</a>, and from the meaning of 'dreaming' 
as a foretelling of things to come, and so in the highest sense as Foresight, dealt with in <a href="3698.htm">3698</a>, <a href="4682.htm">4682</a>, <a href="5091.htm">5091</a>, <a href="5092.htm">5092</a>, <a href="5104.htm">5104</a>. Now since Foresight or the foreseen is meant, Providence or provision 
is meant too, because Foresight and Providence cannot exist one without the other. For Providence has in view the state that is to last for ever; but unless it foresees what this state is, it cannot make 
any provision towards it. A provision for present needs without at the same time any foresight of future ones, and so no simultaneous provision for future needs within present ones, would imply a 
lack of any end in view, or of any order, or of consequently any wisdom and intelligence, and so it would not be something having a Divine origin. But when reference is made to what is good the term Providence 
is used, whereas Foresight is used in reference to what is not good, <a href="5155.htm">5155</a>. One cannot use the term Foresight when speaking of what is good because good resides within the Divine, comes forth 
from the Divine Himself, and exists in accord with the Divine. Rather, this term is used when one refers to what is not good or to what is evil since this comes forth from outside the Divine, from others 
opposed to the Divine. Thus because Providence is used when reference is made to what is good, the term is also used to refer to the joining of the natural to the celestial of the spiritual. This 
is the reason why 'dreaming' at this point means provision that had been made.

`Et Pharaoh somnians': quod significet {1}praevisum de naturali, constat ex repraesentatione `Pharaonis' quod sit naturale, de qua n. 5079, 5080, 5095, 5160; et ex significatione `somniare' quod sit 
praedictio futurorum, ita in supremo sensu Praevidentia, de qua n. 3698, 4682, 5091, 5092, 5104; et quia est Praevidentia seu praevisum, est quoque Providentia seu provisum, nam unum absque altero non 
datur; Providentia enim spectat statum successivum in aeternum, qui nisi praevidetur, non provideri potest; providere praesentia et non simul praevidere futura, et sic non in praesentibus haec simul 
providere, foret absque fine, absque ordine et consequenter absque sapientia et intelligentia, ita non ex Divino{2}; sed de bono praedicatur Providentia et de non bono Praevidentia, n. 5155; de bono 
non praedicari potest Praevidentia, quia bonum est in Divino et existit ab Ipso Divino et secundum Divinum, sed de non bono et de malo, nam hoc existit extra Divinum ab aliis qui contra Divinum {3}; ita 
quia de bono dicitur Providentia, dicitur quoque de conjunctione naturalis cum caelesti spiritualis, de qua in hoc capite agitur, quapropter per `somniare' hic significatur provisum. @1 I has praevisum 
here, provisum seems more correct, see 5193, 5211. From 5226 to 5282 A I have praevisum repeatedly in connection with somnium, but where Deus faciens occurs, provisum.$ @2 i agere$ @3 i sunt$ </p>
