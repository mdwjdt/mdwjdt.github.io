<h3 align="center" class="ired">属天的奥秘 第4586节</h3>
<h4 align="center"></h4><p><strong>4586.</strong>“拉结生产，生得甚是艰难”表内层真理所受的试探。这从“生产”和“甚是艰难”的含义，以及“拉结”的代表清楚可知：“生产”是指属于真理的属灵事物和属于良善的属天事物的产生，因为就内义而言，“生产”表示与属灵生产有关的事物（参看<a href="1145.htm">1145</a>，<a href="1255.htm">1255</a>，<a href="2584.htm">2584</a>，<a href="3860.htm">3860</a>，<a href="3868.htm">3868</a>，<a href="3905.htm">3905</a>，<a href="3915.htm">3915</a>，<a href="3919.htm">3919</a>，<a href="4070.htm">4070</a>节）；“拉结”是指对内层真理的情感（参看<a href="3758.htm">3758</a>，<a href="3782.htm">3782</a>，<a href="3793.htm">3793</a>，<a href="3819.htm">3819</a>节）；“甚是艰难”是指经历试探。事实上，当论及真理与良善，或属灵事物和属天事物时，“甚是艰难”并非表示别的什么，因为若通过试探，没有人能获得这些事物。事实上，在试探期间，内层良善和真理与邪恶和虚假相冲突，这些邪恶和虚假既来自遗传，也来自实际行为。也就是说，在这种时候，主从内起作用，以便将良善和真理保持在他里面；而发起攻击的，正是从遗传喷出，并由于实际行为而存在的邪恶和虚假，也就是存在于这些邪恶和虚假里面，并与此人同居的灵人和魔鬼。试探由此而来，它们不仅带来被征服的邪恶与虚假的抛弃和去除，还带来良善与真理的强化。这些就是“拉结生产，生得甚是艰难”所表示的事。</p>

And Rachel brought forth, and suffered hard things in her bringing forth. That this signifies the temptations of interior truth, is evident from the signification of "bringing forth," as being the coming 
forth of the spiritual things which are of truth and of the celestial things which are of good, for in the internal sense "to bring forth" denotes the things of the spiritual birth (see n. 1145, 
1255, 2584, 3860, 3868, 3905, 3915, 3919, 4070); from the representation of Rachel, as being the affection of interior truth (see n. 3758, 3782, 3793, 3819); and from the signification of "suffering hard 
things," as being to undergo temptations, for when "to suffer hard things" is predicated of truths and goods, or of spiritual things and celestial things, it cannot mean anything else, because no 
one can attain to these except by means of temptations, for then interior goods and truths fight with the evils and falsities from what is hereditary and what is actual, the man being kept by the Lord 
from within in goods and truths, and being assaulted by the evils and falsities which burst forth from what is hereditary, and which are present from what is actual, that is, by the spirits and genii 
who are in these evils and falsities and are with the man. Hence come temptations, whereby not only are evils and falsities, when overcome, cast out and removed, but also goods and truths are confirmed. 
These are the things which are signified by Rachel's bringing forth, and by her suffering hard things in her bringing forth. </p>

'And Rachel gave birth, and suffered severely in giving birth' means the temptations endured by interior truth. This is clear from the meaning of 'giving birth' as the coming into being of spiritual 
entities, which are those of truth, and of celestial entities, which are those of good - for in the internal sense 'giving birth' does not mean anything else than things connected with spiritual birth, 
see <a href="1145.htm">1145</a>, <a href="1255.htm">1255</a>, <a href="2584.htm">2584</a>, <a href="3860.htm">3860</a>, <a href="3868.htm">3868</a>, <a href="3905.htm">3905</a>, <a href="3915.htm">3915</a>, <a href="3919.htm">3919</a>, <a href="4070.htm">4070</a>; from the representation of 'Rachel' as the affection for interior truth, dealt with in <a href="3758.htm">3758</a>, <a href="3782.htm">3782</a>, <a href="3793.htm">3793</a>, <a href="3819.htm">3819</a>; and from the meaning of 'suffering 
severely' as undergoing temptations. For when used in reference to truths and goods, or spiritual and celestial entities, 'suffering severely' does not mean anything else, since nobody can come 
to those things except through temptations. Indeed in times of temptation interior goods and truths clash with the evils and falsities which are a product of a person's heredity and of his own actions. 
That is to say, at such times the Lord acts from within to preserve the goods and truths in him, while an attack is mounted by the evils and falsities which erupt from his heredity and are present as 
a result of his own actions. That is, the attack is mounted by spirits and genii who are present within those evils and falsities and who dwell with that person. This is how temptations arise, and they 
lead not only to the casting aside and removal of evils and falsities when these are conquered but also to the strengthening of goods and truths. These are the things which are meant by the statement 
that Rachel gave birth and suffered severely in giving birth. </p>

`Et peperit Rachel et dura passa in pariendo illam': quod significet tentationes interioris veri, constat ex significatione `parere' quod sit existentia spiritualium quae sunt veri, (c)et caelestium 
quae sunt boni, non enim aliud in sensu interno intelligitur' per parere {1}, quam quae sunt partus spiritualis, videatur n.1145, 1255, 2584, 3860, 3868, 3905, 3915, 3919, 4070; ex repraesentatione 
`Rachelis' quod sit affectio veri interioris, de qua n. 3758, 3782, 3793, 3819; et ex significatione `dura pati' quod sit tentationes subire, cum enim de veris et bonis seu de spiritualibus et 
caelestibus praedicatur `dura pati', non aliud est, nam ad illa pervenire nemo potest quam per tentationes; </p>
<p>pugnant enim tunc interiora bona et vera cum malis et falsis quae ex hereditario et actuali, 
quippe tenetur homo tunc a Domino in bonis et veris ab interiore, et aggrediuntur mala et falsa {2} quae erumpunt ex hereditario et quae adsunt ex actuali, hoc est, spiritus et genii qui {3} in 
illis sunt et apud hominem; inde tentationes, quibus non modo rejiciuntur et removentur mala et falsa cum vincuntur, sed etiam confirmantur bona et vera; haec sunt quae significantur per quod `peperit 
Rachel, et dura passa in pariendo.'      @1 after aliud$      @2 falsis et mala A, mali et falsi I$      @3 i mali$ </p>
