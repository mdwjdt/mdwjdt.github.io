<h3 align="center" class="ired">属天的奥秘 第1992节</h3>
<h4 align="center"></h4><p><strong>1992.</strong>“我是沙代（Shaddai）神”就字义而言，表亚伯兰的神之名，主刚开始以这个名字出现在他们面前。这从圣言中有关亚伯兰和他父家的情况清楚可知，即他们敬拜别神。亚伯兰来自叙利亚，那里仍有古教会的余留，很多家族依旧保持古教会的敬拜。这从来自那地区的希伯明显看出来，希伯来这个民族就从希伯而出。他们同样持守耶和华这个名，这从第一卷所示（<a href="1343.htm">1343</a>节）和巴兰明显可知。巴兰也来自叙利亚，并献祭，称他的神为耶和华。从民数记可以看出，巴兰来自叙利亚（民数记<a href="http://39-27.cn/民23.7.htm">23:7</a>）；他献祭（民数记<a href="http://39-27.cn/民22.39.htm">22:39</a>-<a href="http://39-27.cn/民22.40.htm">40</a>；<a href="http://39-27.cn/民23.1.htm">23:1</a>-<a href="http://39-27.cn/民23.3.htm">3</a>，<a href="http://39-27.cn/民23.14.htm">14</a>，<a href="http://39-27.cn/民23.29.htm">29</a>）；他称耶和华为他的神（民数记<a href="http://39-27.cn/民22.8.htm">22:8</a>，<a href="http://39-27.cn/民22.13.htm">13</a>，<a href="http://39-27.cn/民22.18.htm">18</a>，<a href="http://39-27.cn/民22.31.htm">31</a>；<a href="http://39-27.cn/民23.8.htm">23:8</a>，<a href="http://39-27.cn/民23.12.htm">12</a>，<a href="http://39-27.cn/民23.16.htm">16</a>）。<br />不过，亚伯兰和拿鹤的父亲他拉家的情况不是这样。因为这家不是那里正统宗族的一支，不仅丢失了“耶和华”这个名，还事奉别神；他们不敬拜耶和华，而是敬拜沙代（Shaddai），称其为他们的神。他们丢失了“耶和华”这个名，这从第一卷所引证的事（<a href="1343.htm">1343</a>节）明显可知，他们事奉别神，这在约书亚记中有明确说明：<br />约书亚对众民说，耶和华以色列的神如此说，古时你们的列祖，就是亚伯拉罕和拿鹤的父亲他拉，住在大河那边事奉别神。现在你们要敬畏耶和华，诚心实意地事奉祂，将你们列祖在大河那边和在埃及所事奉的神除掉，去事奉耶和华。若事奉耶和华在你们眼里为恶，今日就可以选择你们所要事奉的，不管是你们列祖在大河那边所事奉的神，还是亚摩利人的神。（约书亚记<a href="http://39-27.cn/书24.2.htm">24:2</a>，<a href="http://39-27.cn/书24.14.htm">14</a>，<a href="http://39-27.cn/书24.15.htm">15</a>）<br />事实上，亚伯兰的兄弟拿鹤和从他所出的民族也事奉别神。这从亚兰人拉班（Laban the Syrian）明显看出来，拉班住在拿鹤城，敬拜拉结所偷走的像或神像（创世记<a href="http://39-27.cn/创24.10.htm">24:10</a>；<a href="http://39-27.cn/创31.19.htm">31:19</a>，<a href="http://39-27.cn/创31.26.htm">26</a>，<a href="http://39-27.cn/创31.32.htm">32</a>，<a href="http://39-27.cn/创31.34.htm">34</a>），也可参看第一卷中有关该主题的论述（<a href="1356.htm">1356</a>节）。他们不敬拜耶和华，而是敬拜沙代（Shaddai），称其为他们的神。这在摩西五经中有明确说明：<br />我，耶和华，从前向亚伯拉罕、以撒、雅各显现为沙代（Shaddai）神，至于我名耶和华，我未曾让他们知道（出埃及记<a href="http://39-27.cn/出6.2.htm">6:2</a>，<a href="http://39-27.cn/出6.3.htm">3</a>）。<br />由此可见，亚伯兰刚成年时和外邦人一样，也是偶像崇拜者，甚至直到住在迦南地这段时间，他仍未从心里放弃沙代（Shaddai）神（就是字义上亚伯兰的神之名）。主刚开始以这个名字出现在他们面前，即出现在亚伯拉罕、以撒和雅各面前，这从刚才所引用的经文明显可知。<br />主刚开始愿意以沙代（Shaddai）之名出现在他们面前，其原因在于，主从不愿突然间（更不用说一瞬间）就摧毁从小就植入在人里面的敬拜。因为这会连根也挖断，从而毁灭根深蒂固的爱慕和敬拜的神圣状态。主从不破碎这神圣状态，而是将其弯过来。敬拜的神圣状态若从小就扎根下来，会具有这样的性质：它无法承受暴力，只能经受温柔、仁慈的弯折。这同样适用于活在肉身期间敬拜偶像，然而却彼此过着仁爱生活的外邦人。由于敬拜的神圣状态从小就根深蒂固，所以在来世，它不会在一瞬间，而是逐渐被除去。因为信的良善与真理很容易被植入在那些彼此过着仁爱生活的人里面。他们随后会欣然接受这些良善与真理，因为仁爱就是土壤本身。这也是亚伯拉罕、以撒和雅各的情形，主允许他们持守沙代（Shaddai）神这个名，以至于祂说，祂是沙代（Shaddai）神，祂这样做是由于这个名字的含义。<br />有些译者将沙代（Shaddai）译为“全能者”（the Almighty），有的则译为“怒吼者”（the Thunderer）。但严格来说，它表示“试探者”（the Tempter）或“测试者”（Tester）和“恩主”（the Benefactor），就是试探之后行善的那一位。这一点从约伯记明显可知，约伯因遭受很多试探，故多次提及沙代（Shaddai）。这从以下经文可以看出来：<br />看哪，神所责备的人是有福的，不可轻看沙代（Shaddai）的管教。（约伯记<a href="http://39-27.cn/伯5.17.htm">5:17</a>）<br />沙代（Shaddai）的箭射入我身，神的惊吓摆阵攻击我。（约伯记<a href="http://39-27.cn/伯6.4.htm">6:4</a>）<br />他要舍弃对沙代（Shaddai）的敬畏。（约伯记<a href="http://39-27.cn/伯6.14.htm">6:14</a>）<br />我真要对沙代（Shaddai）说话，我愿与神理论。（约伯记<a href="http://39-27.cn/伯13.3.htm">13:3</a>）<br />他伸手攻击神，逞强对抗沙代（Shaddai）。（约伯记<a href="http://39-27.cn/伯15.25.htm">15:25</a>）<br />愿他亲眼看见自己败亡，亲自饮沙代（Shaddai）的愤怒。（约伯记<a href="http://39-27.cn/伯21.20.htm">21:20</a>）<br />论到沙代（Shaddai），你们查不出他；他大有能力，有公平和大义，必不苦待人。（约伯记<a href="http://39-27.cn/伯37.23.htm">37:23</a>）<br />还有约珥书：<br />哀哉那日！因为耶和华的日子临近了！好像毁灭从沙代（Shaddai）来到。（约珥书<a href="http://39-27.cn/珥1.15.htm">1:15</a>）<br />这也可从沙代（Shaddai）这个词本身清楚看出来，沙代（Shaddai）表示消磨，因而表示试探，因为试探就是一种消磨。不过，这个名字是从叙利亚的各民族中兴起的，故他不是叫“耶洛因沙代”（ Elohim Shaddai），而是叫“伊勒沙代”（El Shaddai）。在约伯记中，他只是简单地叫沙代（Shaddai），而“伊勒”（El）或“神”则单独被提及。<br />由于试探之后随之而来的是安慰，所以人们也将出于试探的好处归于同一个沙代（如约伯记<a href="http://39-27.cn/伯22.17.htm">22:17</a>，<a href="http://39-27.cn/伯22.23.htm">23</a>，<a href="http://39-27.cn/伯22.25.htm">25</a>-<a href="http://39-27.cn/伯22.26.htm">26</a>）；他们还将由那些试探（约伯记<a href="http://39-27.cn/伯32.8.htm">32:8</a>；<a href="http://39-27.cn/伯33.4.htm">33:4</a>）所产生的对真理的理解归于他。由于沙代以这种方式被视为真理之神（因为消磨、试探、惩治、责备绝不属于良善，只属于真理），还由于主以他出现在亚伯拉罕、以撒、雅各面前，故这个名字甚至被保留在先知书中。但在先知书中，“沙代”只用来表示真理。如以西结书：<br />活物行走的时候，我听见翅膀的响声，像众水的声音，像沙代（Shaddai）的声音，也像军队哄嚷的声音。（以西结书<a href="http://39-27.cn/结1.24.htm">1:24</a>）<br />同一先知书：<br />院宇也被耶和华荣耀的光辉充满。基路伯翅膀的响声听到外院，好像沙代（Shaddai）神说话的声音。（以西结书<a href="http://39-27.cn/结10.4.htm">10:4</a>，<a href="http://39-27.cn/结10.5.htm">5</a>）<br />此处耶和华表良善，沙代表真理。在圣言中，“翅膀”的内义同样表属于信的事物。<br />另外，以撒和雅各也以同样的方式提及沙代神，也就是说，是试探并通过试探解救，然后带来好处的那一位。当雅各因以扫而即将逃离时，以撒对他说：<br />愿沙代（Shaddai）神赐福给你，使你繁殖增多。（创世记<a href="http://39-27.cn/创28.3.htm">28:3</a>）<br />当雅各的众子即将到埃及买粮时，他们非常害怕约瑟，于是雅各对他们说：<br />但愿沙代神使你们在那人面前蒙怜悯，释放你们的那弟兄和便雅悯回来。（创世记<a href="http://39-27.cn/创43.14.htm">43:14</a>）<br />雅各，那时叫以色列，赐福给约瑟（他经历的罪恶试探比他的兄弟们还多，并从它们当中被解救出来）时，说：<br />你父亲的神必帮助你，那沙代（Shaddai）必将赐福给你。（创世记<a href="http://39-27.cn/创49.25.htm">49:25</a>）<br />所有这一切解释了为何神刚开始愿意作为亚伯兰所敬拜的沙代神出现，为何祂声称“我是沙代神”，后来，祂以同样的方式对雅各说，“我是沙代神，你要繁殖增多”（创世记<a href="http://39-27.cn/创35.11.htm">35:11</a>）。更深层的原因是，就内义而言，前文论述的主题是试探。<br />这些人敬拜沙代源于以下事实：与某个民族（蒙主怜悯，该民族会在下文有所描述），因而与那些属于古教会之人的情况一样，他们经常听见灵人责难他们，然后也会安慰他们。责难他们的灵人被发觉在左侧，在胳膊下面。这种时候，天使会在场，从头部管理这些灵人，缓和责难。由于他们以为这些灵人对他们所说的一切话都是神性，故他们称责难的灵为“沙代”。因为后来他也给予安慰，所以他们又称他为“沙代神”。那时的人们，包括犹太人，并不懂圣言的内义，他们所持守的宗教信仰认为，正如一切良善，因而一切安慰都出于神，一切罪恶，因而一切试探也都出于神。但事实根本不是这样，对此，可参看第一卷（<a

I am God Shaddai. That in the sense of the letter this signifies the name of Abram's God, by which name the Lord was first represented before them, is evident from the things contained in the Word concerning 
Abram, and concerning the house of his father, in that they adored other gods. In Syria, whence Abram came, there still existed remains of the Ancient Church, and many families there retained 
its worship-as is evident from Eber who was of that country, from whom came the Hebrew nation-and they in like manner retained the name "Jehovah," as is evident from what has been shown in Part First 
(n. 1343), and also from the case of Balaam, who was from Syria and offered sacrifices and called Jehovah his God. That Balaam was from Syria may be seen in Numbers 23:7; that he offered sacrifices, 
Num. 22:39-40; 23:1-3, 14, 29; that he called Jehovah his God, Num. 22:8, 13, 18, 31; 23:8, 12, 16.  [2] But this was not the case with the house of Terah, the father of Abram and Nahor, for this was 
one of the families of the nations there that had not only lost the name "Jehovah" but had also served other gods, and instead of Jehovah had worshiped Shaddai, whom they called their god. That they 
had lost the name "Jehovah," is evident from the things adduced in Part First (n. 1343). And that they served other gods is openly stated in Joshua: </p>
<p>     Joshua said unto all the people, Thus hath said 
Jehovah, the God of Israel, Your fathers dwelt of old time beyond the River, Terah the father of Abraham and the father of Nahor, and they served other gods; now fear Jehovah, and serve Him in entirety 
and in truth; and put away the gods that your fathers served beyond the River, and in Egypt, and serve ye Jehovah. And if it be evil in your eyes to serve Jehovah, choose ye this day whom ye will 
serve, whether the gods that your fathers served that were beyond the River, or the gods of the Amorites (Josh. 24:2, 14-15). That Nahor also, the brother of Abram, and the nation descended from him, 
served other gods, is evident from Laban the Syrian, who was in the city of Nahor and worshiped images or teraphim, which Rachel carried away (Gen. 24:10; 31:19, 26, 32, 34). See also what is said on 
this subject in Part First (n. 1356). That instead of Jehovah they worshiped Shaddai, whom they called their god, is distinctly stated in Moses: </p>
<p>     I (Jehovah) appeared unto Abraham, unto Isaac, 
and unto Jacob, as God Shaddai; and by My name Jehovah was I not known to them (Exod. 6:3). [3] From all this we may see that in his early manhood, Abram, like other Gentiles, was an idolater, and that 
up to this time, while living in the land of Canaan, he had not rejected from his mind the god Shaddai-by which is meant in the sense of the letter the name of Abram's god-and that by this name the 
Lord was first represented before them (that is, before Abram, Isaac, and Jacob), as is evident from the passage just quoted.  [4] The reason why the Lord was willing to be first represented before 
them by the name "Shaddai" is that the Lord by no means desires to destroy suddenly (still less in a single moment) the worship that has been inseminated in anyone from his infancy; for this would be 
to tear up the root, and thereby destroy the holy state of adoration and of worship that has been deeply implanted, and which the Lord never breaks, but bends. The holy state of worship, that has been 
rooted in from infancy is of such a nature that it cannot endure violence, but only a gentle and kindly bending. The case is the same with those Gentiles who in their bodily life had worshiped idols, 
and yet had lived in mutual charity. As the holy state of their worship has been inrooted from their infancy, in the other life it is not taken away in a moment, but successively; for in those who have 
lived in mutual charity, the goods and truths of faith can be easily implanted, and they receive them afterwards with joy; for charity is the very soil. And such also was the case with Abraham, Isaac, 
and Jacob, in that the Lord suffered them to retain the name "God Shaddai," insomuch that He said He was God Shaddai; and this from the meaning of the name.  [5] Some translators render Shaddai "the 
Almighty;" others, "the Thunderer;" but it properly signifies "the Tempter" or "Tester," and "the Benefactor," after the temptations" or "trials," as is evident from the book of Job, which mentions 
"Shaddai" so frequently because Job was in trials or temptations; as may be seen from the following passages: </p>
<p>     Behold, happy is the man whom God chastiseth; and reject not thou the chastening of 
Shaddai (Job 5:17). The arrows of Shaddai are with me, the terrors of God do set themselves in array against me (Job 6:4). He shall forsake the fear of Shaddai (Job 6:14). I will speak to Shaddai, and 
I desire to contend with God (Job 13:3). He hath stretched out his hand against God, and strengtheneth himself against Shaddai  His eyes shall see his destruction, and he shall drink of the fury of 
Shaddai (Job 21:20). Shaddai, thou shalt not find Him out; He is great in power, and in judgment, and in the greatness of righteousness. He will not afflict (Job 37:23). Also in Joel: </p>
<p>     Alas for 
the day! for the day of Jehovah is near, and as devastation from Shaddai shall it come (Joel 1:15). The same may also be seen from the word shaddai itself, which signifies vastation, and thus temptation, 
for temptation is a kind of vastation. But as this name took its rise from nations in Syria, He is not called "Elohim Shaddai," but "El Shaddai;" and in Job simply "Shaddai," and "El" or "God" is 
named separately.  [6] As after temptations there is consolation, those people also attributed the good resulting from them to the same Shaddai (as in Job 22:17, 23, 25-26); as well as the understanding 
of truth, which also results from temptations (Job 32:8; 33:4). And as Shaddai was thus esteemed as the god of truth-for vastation, temptation, chastening, and rebuking, are not of good, but of 
truth-and because the Lord was represented by him before Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob, the name was retained even in the Prophets; but in them by "Shaddai" is meant truth. As in Ezekiel: </p>
<p>     I heard the 
voice of the wings of the cherubim, like the voice of many waters, like the voice of Shaddai, when they went; the voice of tumult, like the voice of a camp (Ezek. 1:24). And again: </p>
<p>     The court 
was filled with the brightness of the glory of Jehovah; and the voice of the wings of the cherubim was heard even to the outer court, as the voice of God Shaddai when He speaketh (Ezek. 10:4-5); </p>
<p>where 
"Jehovah" denotes good, and "Shaddai" truth. In the internal sense of the Word "wings" in like manner signify things that belong to truth.  [7] Moreover Isaac and Jacob also make mention of the God 
Shaddai in a similar sense, that is, as of one who tempts, and delivers from temptation, and afterwards confers benefits. When Jacob was fleeing because of Esau, Isaac said to him,       God Shaddai 
bless thee, and make thee fruitful and multiply thee (Gen. 28:3). And when the sons of Jacob were about to go into Egypt to buy corn, and when they feared Joseph so greatly, Jacob said to them, God 
Shaddai give you mercies before the man, that he may release unto you your other brother, and Benjamin (Gen. 43:14). Jacob, then called Israel, blessing Joseph, who had been in the evils of temptations, 
or trials, more than his brethren, and had been delivered from them, said, By the God of thy father, and He shall help thee, and with Shaddai, and he shall bless thee (Gen. 49:25). All this shows 
why the Lord was at first willing to be represented by the god Shaddai whom Abram worshiped, and why He said "I am God Shaddai;" as in like manner He afterwards said to Jacob, "I am God Shaddai; be 
fruitful and multiply" (Gen. 35:11); and a further reason was that in what goes before, temptations were treated of in the internal sense.  [8] The worship of Shaddai among those people originated from 
the fact that, as was the case with a certain nation that of the Lord's Divine mercy will be spoken of in what follows, so with those who were of the Ancient Church, there were often heard spirits 
who reproved them and who also afterwards comforted them. The spirits who reproved them were perceived at the left side, beneath the arm. Angels were present at such times, at the head, who governed 
the spirits and moderated the reproof. And as there was nothing that was said to them by the spirits which they did not regard as Divine, they named the reproving spirit "Shaddai;" and because he afterwards 
administered consolation, they called him "the god Shaddai." The men at that time, as also the Jews, because they did not understand the internal sense of the Word, were in the religious belief 
that all evil and thus all temptation, like all good and thus all consolation, come from God; but that it is not so, may be seen in Part First (n. 245, 592, 696, 1093, 1874, 1875). </p>

<p align="center"><b>Elliott(1983-1999) 1992</b></p><p><b>1992.</b>
'I am God Shaddai' means, in the sense of the letter, the name of Abram's God, by means of which the Lord was represented before them at first. This is clear from references in the Word to Abram and 
his father's house worshipping other gods. Surviving in Syria, where Abram came from, there were remnants of the Ancient Church, and many families there retained its worship, as is clear in the case of 
Eber who came from those parts and from whom the Hebrew nation descended. They likewise retained the name Jehovah, as is evident from what has been shown in Volume One, in <a href="1343.htm">1343</a>, and from Balaam, who 
also came from Syria, and who offered sacrifices and called his God Jehovah. That he came from Syria is indicated in <a href="http://bible.gospelcom.net/cgi-bin/bible?passage=Num%2023:7&amp;version=ESV&amp;interface=print&amp;showfn=yes&amp;showxref">Num 23:7</a>; that he offered sacrifices, in <a href="http://bible.gospelcom.net/cgi-bin/bible?passage=Num%2022:39,%2040;%2023:1-3,%2014,%2029&amp;version=ESV&amp;interface=print&amp;showfn=yes&amp;showxref">Num 22:39, 40; 23:1-3, 14, 29</a>; and that

<p></p>
<p><b>[2]</b>
 But in the case of the house of Terah, Abram and Nahor's father, this was not so. That house was one of the gentile families there 
which had not only lost the name of Jehovah but also served other gods; and instead of Jehovah they worshipped Shaddai, whom they called their own god. The fact that they had lost the name of Jehovah 
is clear from the places quoted in Volume One, in <a href="1343.htm">1343</a>; and the fact that they served other gods is explicitly stated in Joshua, </p>
<blockquote>
Joshua said to all the people, Thus said Jehovah, the God of Israel, 
Your fathers dwelt of old beyond the River, Terah, the father of Abraham and the father of Nahor, and they served other gods. Now fear Jehovah, and serve Him in sincerity and truth, and put away 
the gods which your fathers served beyond the River, and in Egypt, and serve Jehovah. And if it is evil in your eyes to serve Jehovah, choose this day whom you are to serve, whether the gods which your 
fathers served who were beyond the River, or the gods of the Amorites. <a href="http://bible.gospelcom.net/cgi-bin/bible?passage=Josh%2024:2,%2014,%2015&amp;version=ESV&amp;interface=print&amp;showfn=yes&amp;showxref">Josh 24:2, 14, 15</a>. 
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
The fact that Nahor as well, Abram's brother, and the nation that descended from him, served other gods 
is also clear from Laban the Syrian, who lived in the city of Nahor and worshipped the images or seraphim which Rachel stole, <a href="http://bible.gospelcom.net/cgi-bin/bible?passage=Gen%2024:10;%2031:19,%2030,%2032,%2034%20-&amp;version=ESV&amp;interface=print&amp;showfn=yes&amp;showxref">Gen 24:10; 31:19, 30, 32, 34 -</a>

see what has been stated in Volume One, in <a href="1356.htm">1356</a>. That instead of Jehovah they worshipped Shaddai, whom they called their god, is plainly stated in Moses, </p>
<blockquote>
I, Jehovah, appeared to Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob as God Shaddai, and by My name Jehovah 
I was not known to them. <a href="http://bible.gospelcom.net/cgi-bin/bible?passage=Exod%206:2,%203&amp;version=ESV&amp;interface=print&amp;showfn=yes&amp;showxref">Exod 6:2, 3</a>.

 These references show what Abram was by disposition in his younger days, namely an idolater like other gentiles, and that even up to and during the time 
he was in the land of Canaan he had not cast the god Shaddai away from his mind; and this accounts for the declaration here, 'I am God Shaddai', which in the sense of the letter means the name of 
Abram's god. And from <a href="http://bible.gospelcom.net/cgi-bin/bible?passage=Exod%206:2,%203&amp;version=ESV&amp;interface=print&amp;showfn=yes&amp;showxref">Exod 6:2, 3</a>, that has just been quoted, it is evident that it was by this name that the Lord was first represented before them - before Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob. </p>
<p></p>
<p><b>[4]</b>
 The reason 
the Lord was willing to be represented before them first of all through the name Shaddai is that the Lord is never willing to destroy quickly, still less immediately, the worship implanted in someone 
since earliest childhood. He is unwilling to destroy it because it would be an uprooting and so a destroying of the deeply implanted feeling for what is holy which is expressed in adoration and worship, 
a feeling which the Lord never crushes but bends. The holiness which is expressed in worship and has been inrooted since earliest childhood is such that it does not respond to violence but to gentle 
and kindly bending. The same applies to gentiles who during their lifetime have worshipped idols and yet have led charitable lives one with another. Because the holiness expressed in their worship 
has been inrooted since earliest childhood it is not removed all of a sudden in the next life but gradually. For people who have led charitable lives one with another are able to have implanted in 
them without difficulty the goods and truths of faith; these they subsequently receive with joy, charity being the soil itself. This is what happened in the case of Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob, that is 
to say, the Lord allowed them to retain the name God Shaddai; indeed He went so far as to speak of Himself as God Shaddai, which He did because of what that name meant. </p>
<p></p>
<p><b>[5]</b>
 Some translators render 
Shaddai as the Almighty, others as the Thunderbolt-hurler. But strictly speaking it means the Tempter, and the One who does good following temptations, as is clear in Job who, because he suffered many 
temptations, mentions Shaddai so many times, such as the following places in his book make clear, </p>
<p>Behold, blessed is the man whom God reproves; and despise not the chastening of Shaddai. <a href="http://bible.gospelcom.net/cgi-bin/bible?passage=Job%205:17&amp;version=ESV&amp;interface=print&amp;showfn=yes&amp;showxref">Job 5:17</a>. </p>
<blockquote>
The 
arrows of Shaddai are with me, the terrors of God are arrayed against me. <a href="http://bible.gospelcom.net/cgi-bin/bible?passage=Job%206:4&amp;version=ESV&amp;interface=print&amp;showfn=yes&amp;showxref">Job 6:4</a>. 
</blockquote>
He will forsake the fear of Shaddai. <a href="http://bible.gospelcom.net/cgi-bin/bible?passage=Job%206:14&amp;version=ESV&amp;interface=print&amp;showfn=yes&amp;showxref">Job 6:14</a>. I will speak to Shaddai, and I desire to dispute with God. Job 
13:3. He has stretched forth his hand against God, and emboldens himself against Shaddai <a href="http://bible.gospelcom.net/cgi-bin/bible?passage=Job%2015:25&amp;version=ESV&amp;interface=print&amp;showfn=yes&amp;showxref">Job 15:25</a>. His eyes will see his destruction and he will drink of the wrath of Shaddai. <a href="http://bible.gospelcom.net/cgi-bin/bible?passage=Job%2021:20&amp;version=ESV&amp;interface=print&amp;showfn=yes&amp;showxref">Job 21:20</a>. As for 
Shaddai, you will not find him. He is great in power and judgement, and in the abundance of righteousness. He will not afflict. <a href="http://bible.gospelcom.net/cgi-bin/bible?passage=Job%2037:23&amp;version=ESV&amp;interface=print&amp;showfn=yes&amp;showxref">Job 37:23</a>. </p>
<p>Also in Joel, </p>
<blockquote>
Alas for the day! For the day of Jehovah 
is near, and as destruction from Shaddai will it come. <a href="http://bible.gospelcom.net/cgi-bin/bible?passage=Joel%201:15&amp;version=ESV&amp;interface=print&amp;showfn=yes&amp;showxref">Joel 1:15</a>. 
</blockquote>
<p>This becomes clear also from the actual word Shaddai, which means vastation, thus temptation, for temptation is a variety of vastation. 
But because the name had its origins among the nations in Syria, he is not called Elohim Shaddai but El Shaddai; and in Job he is called simply Shaddai, with El, or God, mentioned separately. </p>
<p></p>
<p><b>[6]</b>
Because comfort follows temptations people also attributed the good that comes out of temptations to the same Shaddai, as in <a href="http://bible.gospelcom.net/cgi-bin/bible?passage=Job%2022:17,%2023,%2025,%2026&amp;version=ESV&amp;interface=print&amp;showfn=yes&amp;showxref">Job 22:17, 23, 25, 26</a>; and they also attributed to him the understanding 
of truth which resulted from those <a href="http://bible.gospelcom.net/cgi-bin/bible?passage=temptations%2032:8;%2033:4&amp;version=ESV&amp;interface=print&amp;showfn=yes&amp;showxref">temptations 32:8; 33:4</a>. And because in this way he was regarded as a god of truth, for vastation, temptation, chastisement, and reproving belong in no way to good 
but to truth, and because the Lord was represented by means of it before Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob, the name was retained even among the Prophets. But with the latter Shaddai was used to mean truth, 
as in Ezekiel, </p>
<p>I heard the sound of the cherubs' wings, like the sound of many waters, like the sound of Shaddai as they were coming, a sound of tumult, like the sound of a camp. <a href="http://bible.gospelcom.net/cgi-bin/bible?passage=Ezek%201:24&amp;version=ESV&amp;interface=print&amp;showfn=yes&amp;showxref">Ezek 1:24</a>. </p>
<p>In 
the same prophet, </p>
<blockquote>
The court was full of the brightness of the glory of Jehovah, and the sound of the wings of the cherubs was heard as far as the outer court, like the voice of the god Shaddai when 
he speaks. <a href="http://bible.gospelcom.net/cgi-bin/bible?passage=Ezek%2010:4,%205&amp;version=ESV&amp;interface=print&amp;showfn=yes&amp;showxref">Ezek 10:4, 5</a>. 
</blockquote>
<p>Here Jehovah stands for good, Shaddai for truth. 'Wings' likewise in the Word means in the internal sense things that are matters of truth. </p>
<p></p>
<p><b>[7]</b>
 Isaac and Jacob too used 
the name God Shaddai in a similar way, namely as one who tempts, rescues from temptation, and after that does good to them. Isaac addressed his son Jacob when he was about to flee on account of Esau, </p>
<blockquote>
God 
Shaddai bless you and make you fruitful and multiply you. <a href="http://bible.gospelcom.net/cgi-bin/bible?passage=Gen%2028:3&amp;version=ESV&amp;interface=print&amp;showfn=yes&amp;showxref">Gen 28:3</a>. 
</blockquote>
<p>Jacob addressed his sons when they were about to journey into Egypt to buy grain and were so greatly afraid of Joseph, </p>
<blockquote>
May 
God Shaddai grant you mercy before the man, and may He send back with you your other brother and Benjamin. <a href="http://bible.gospelcom.net/cgi-bin/bible?passage=Gen%2043:14&amp;version=ESV&amp;interface=print&amp;showfn=yes&amp;showxref">Gen 43:14</a>. 
</blockquote>
<p>Jacob, by now Israel, when blessing Joseph, who had experienced the evils 
of temptation more than his brothers and had been released from them, declared, </p>
<p>By the God of your father, and He will help you; and with Shaddai, and He will bless you. Gen. <a href="49.htm">49</a>. <a href="25.htm">25</a>. </p>
<p>This then 
explains why the Lord was willing to be represented at first as God Shaddai whom Abram worshipped when He declared, </p>
<p>I am God Shaddai. </p>
<blockquote>
And later on He referred to Himself in a similar way before 
Jacob, I am God Shaddai; be fruitful and multiply. <a href="http://bible.gospelcom.net/cgi-bin/bible?passage=Gen%2035:11&amp;version=ESV&amp;interface=print&amp;showfn=yes&amp;showxref">Gen 35:11</a>. 
</blockquote>
<p>And a further reason is that the subject of the internal sense in what has gone before has been temptations. </p>
<p></p>
<p><b>[8]</b>
 The worship of 
Shaddai with them had its origin, as it did with a certain nation which in the Lord's Divine mercy will be described later on, and also with those who belonged to the Ancient Church, in the fact that 
quite often they heard spirits who reproached them and who also afterwards consoled them. The spirits who reproached them were perceived as being on the left side below the arm; at the same time angels 
were present from the head who overruled the spirits and toned down the reproaching. And because they imagined that everything declared to them through the spirits was Divine, they called the reproaching 
spirit Shaddai. And because he also afterwards gave consolation they called him God Shaddai. Since they had no understanding of the internal sense of the Word, people in those days, including the 
Jews, possessed that kind of religion in which they imagined that all evil and so all temptation came from God just as all good and thus all comfort did. But that in actual fact this is not at all the 
case, see Volume One, in <a href="245.htm">245</a>, <a href="592.htm">592</a>, <a href="696.htm">696</a>, <a href="1093.htm">1093</a>, <a href="1874.htm">1874</a>, <a href="1875.htm">1875</a>. </p>

`Ego Deus Shaddai': quod significet nomen Dei Abrami in sensu litterae, per quod primum coram illis repraesentatus Dominus, constat ex illis quae in Verbo de Abramo et de domo patris ejus, quod alios 
deos adoraverint.  In Syria, unde Abram, Ecclesiae Antiquae reliquiae manserunt, et ibi plures familiae retinuerunt cultum, ut constat ex Ebero qui inde, unde gens Hebraea, et similiter retinuerunt 
nomen Jehovae, ut patet {1} ex illis quae in Parte Prima ostensa sunt n. 1343, et ex Bileamo qui etiam ex Syria, et sacrificia obtulit, et Jehovam Deum suum appellavit; quod e Syria, Num. xxiii 7; quod 
sacrificia obtulit, Num. xxii 39, 40; xxiii 1-3, 14, 29; quod Jehovam Deum suum appellavit, Num. xxii 8, 13, 18, 31; xxiii 8, 12, 16.  [2] Domus vero Terahi patris Abrami et Nahoris non ita; illa ibi 
inter familias gentium erat quae non solum perdiderunt nomen Jehovae sed etiam serviverunt aliis diis, et pro Jehovah coluerunt Shaddai, quem suum deum appellarunt; quod perdiderint nomen Jehovae, constat 
ab illi: quae allata sunt in Parte Prima n. 1343; et quod serviverint aliis diis aperte dicitur apud Joshuam, 	Dixit Joshua ad omnem populum; Sic dixit Jehovah Deus Israelis, Trans fluvium habitarunt 
patres vestri a saeculo, Terahus Pater Abrahami et pater Nahoris, et serviverunt diis aliis:... nunc timete Jehovam, et servite Ipsi in integritate et veritate, et removete deos, quibus serviverunt 
patres vestri trans fluvium et in Aegypto, et servite Jehovae: et si malum in oculis vestris servire Jehovae, eligite vobis hodie cui serviatis, sive diis quibus serviverunt patre vestri qui trans 
fluvium, sive diis Emoraeis, xxiv 2, 14, 15; </p>
<p>quod etiam' Nahor frater Abrami, et gens ex illo serviverit aliis diis: constat quoque ex Labane Syro, qui fuit in urbe Nahoris, et coluit imagines seu 
teraphim, quas abstulit Rachel, Gen. xxiv 10; xxxi 19: (x)30, 32, 34; videantur quae de illis in Parte Prima n. 1356; quod pro Jehovah coluerint Shaddai, quem suum deum appellarunt, manifeste dicitur 
apud Mosen, 	Ego Jehovah apparui Abrahamo, Isaco et Jacobo, in deo Shaddai, et nomine Meo Jehovah non notus fui illis, Exod. vi (x)2, 3 [3]	Ex his constare potest, qualis fuit Abram in juventute sua, 
quod nempe sicut alii gentiles idololatra et quod adhuc dum in terra Canaane fuit, non ex animo suo rejecerit deum Shaddai, quare hic dicitur, Ego Deus Shaddai, quo significatur nomen dei Abrami in 
sensu litterae, et quod per illius nomen coram illis, nempe Abrahamo {2}, Isaco et Jacobo, ut patet (c)ex loco citato, Exod. vi 3, primum repraesentatus Dominus: [4] quod Dominus primum repraesentari 
voluit coram illis per nomen Shaddai, causa est quia Dominus nusquam subito, minus momento, destruere vult inseminatum alicui ab infantia cultum, nam hoc foret evellere radicem et sic destruere sanctum 
adorationis et cultus alte implantatum, quod Dominus nusquam frangit sed flectit; sanctum cultus ab infantia irradicatum hoc secum habet quod non patiatur violentiam, sed flexionem lentam et clementem; 
simile fit cum gentilibus qui in vita corporis coluerunt idola, et tamen in charitate mutua vixerunt, sanctum eorum cultus, {3} quia ab infantia eorum irradicatum, in altera vita non momento tollitur 
sed successive; qui enim in charitate mutua vixerunt, eis implantari facile possunt bona et vera fidei, quae postea cum gaudio recipiunt; nam charitas est ipse humus: ita factum cum Abrahamo, Isaco 
et Jacobo, quod nempe passus Dominus, ut retinerent nomen dei Shaddai, usque adeo ut diceret Se esse deum Shaddai; et hoc ex significatione ejus. [5] Interpretes Shaddai reddunt omnipotentem, alii 
fulminatorem; sed proprie significat tentatorem, et post tentationes benefactorem, sicut constat apud Hiobum, qui toties eum, quia in tentationibus fuit, memorat, ut ex his locis apud eum constare potest, 	Ecce 
beati, homo quem castigat Deus; et disciplinam Shaddai ne repudies, v 17: </p>
<p>	Sagittae Shaddai mecum,... terrores Dei aciem instruunt mihi, vi 4: </p>
<p>	Timorem Shaddai relinquet, vi 14: </p>
<p>	Ego ad 
Shaddai loquar, et disceptare cum Deo volo,     xiii 3: </p>
<p>	Extendit adversus Deum manum suam, et adversus Shaddai confortat se, xv 25: </p>
<p>	Videbunt oculi illius exitium illius, et de furore Shaddai bibet, 
xxi 20: </p>
<p>	Shaddai non invenies eum, magnus potentia, et judicio, et magnitudine justitiae, non affliget, xxxvii 23: </p>
<p>tum apud Joelem, 	Hei diei, quia propinquus dies Jehovae, et sicut devastatio a 
Shaddai veniet, i 15. Quod etiam constare potest ab ipsa voce Shaddai, quae significat vastationem, ita tentationem, nam tentatio est species vastationis; sed quia originem tulit a gentibus in Syria, 
non vocatur Elohim Shaddai, sed El Shaddai, et apud Hiobum modo Shaddai, et El seu Deus separatim nominatur.  [6] Quia post tentationes solatium, etiam eidem Shaddai tribuerunt bonum quod inde, ut apud 
Hiobum, xxii 17, 23, 25, 26; tum intellectum veri qui etiam inde, xxxii 8; xxxiii 4; et quia (o)sic pro deo veri habitus, nam vastatio, tentatio, castigatio, et increpatio nusquam est boni sed est 
veri; et quia coram Abrahamo {4}, Isaco, et Jacobo per eum repraesentatus Dominus, retentum fuit nomen, etiam apud Prophetas, sed ibi per Shaddai intelligitur verum, ut apud Ezechielem, 	Audivi vocem 
alarum cheruborum, tanquam vocem aquarum multarum, tanquam vocem Shaddai, cum ibant, vocem tumultus {5}, tanquam vocem castrorum, i 24: </p>
<p>apud eundem, 	Atrium impletum est splendore gloriae Jehovae, 
et vox alarum cheruborum audita est, usque ad atrium exterius, tanquam vox dei Shaddai, cum loquitur, x 4, 5; </p>
<p>ubi `Jehovah' pro bono, `Shaddai' pro vero {6}; per `alas' in Verbo similiter illa quae 
sunt veri, in sensu interno significantur.  [7] Etiam Isacus et Jacobus deum Shaddai nominant in simili sensu, qui nempe tentat et liberat a tentatione et postea benefacit; Isacus ad filium suum Jacobum 
cum fugeret pro Esavo, 	Deus Shaddai benedicat tibi, et fructificet, et multiplicet te, Gen. xxviii 3: </p>
<p>Jacobus ad filios suos, cum proficiscerentur in Aegyptum ad emendum frumentum, cum tantum timuerunt 
Josephum, 	Deus Shaddai det vobis misericordias coram viro, et dimittat vobis fratrem vestrum alterum, et Benjaminem, Gen. xlii 14: </p>
<p>Jacobus, ibi Israel, benedicens Josepho, qui prae suis fratribus 
in tentationum malis fuit, et inde liberatus, 	A Deo patris tui, et juvabit te, et cum Shaddai, et benedicet tibi, Gen. xlix 25. Inde nunc est quod Dominus primum voluit repraesentari per Deum 
Shaddai quem Abram coluit, dicens, 	Ego Deus Shaddai, similiter dein coram Jacobo, 	Ego Deus Shaddai, fructificare et multiplicare, Gen.  xxxv 11; </p>
<p>ex causa etiam quia in praecedentibus de tentationibus, 
in interno sensu, actum.  [8] Cultus Shaddai apud illos inde originem duxit, quod sicut apud gentem quandam, de qua, ex Divina Domini Misericordia in sequentibus, etiam apud illos qui fuerunt 
ab Ecclesia Antiqua saepius auditi fuerint spiritus qui increparent, tum qui dein consolarentur; spiritus qui increparunt percepti ad latus sinistrum sub brachio, angeli tunc aderant a capite qui regebant 
spiritus et moderabantur increpationem; et quia nihil non quod per spiritus illis dicebatur putabant Divinum esse, spiritum illum increpatorem nominabant Shaddai; et quia etiam consolabatur postea, 
deum Shaddai: (c)illo tempore, sicut etiam Judaei, in ea religione fuerunt, quia sensum internum Verbi non intellexerunt, quod omne malum, ita omni tentatio, a Deo, sicut omne bonum, ita omne solatium, 
veniret; sed quod aliter se habeat, videantur quae in Parte Prima n. 245, 592, 696, 1093, 1874, 1875. 	@1 constat.$ 	@2 Abramo.$ 	@3 i quod AI.$ 	@4 Abramo.$ 	@5 alarum AI, but tumultus (as 
Hebrew) in all other cases where quoted.$ 	@6 i quod increpat.$ </p>
