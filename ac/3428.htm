<h4 align="center"></h4><p><strong>3428.</strong>“他们又挖了一口井，又为这井争竞”表是否存在圣言内义这回事。这从“又一口井”和“争竞”（如前所述），因而从整个思路清楚可知。对否认某事存在的人，如那些否认圣言内义存在的人来说，随后的争竞或争论必是关于这事是否存在的。众所周知，当今绝大多数争论仅止于此。但只要人们在事情是否存在，并且是否如此方面陷入论战，他们就永远不可能在智慧上取得任何进展。他们所争论的事情本身包含无数方面，只要不承认这事的存在，他们就永远看不到这些方面。因为在这种情况下，他们一直不知道属于它的一切。<br />现在的学问几乎没有越过争论事情是否存在、是否如此这个点。其结果就是阻碍了人们明智地理解真理。例如，人若仅仅争论圣言内义是否存在，就是永远看不到内义所包含的无数，甚至无限细节。又或者，人若争论仁爱是不是教会的事，并且构成仁爱的一切事是不是信的事务，就绝无可能知道存在于仁爱中的无数，甚至无限事物。相反，他依旧全然不知何为仁爱。<br />死后生命、死人复活、最后的审判、天堂与地狱也一样。那些只争论这些事是否存在的人，依旧站在智慧的大门之外，就像是只敲门，甚至无法窥见智慧的宏伟宫殿之人。说来奇怪，这种人却自以为比谁都智慧，认为越能辩论事情是否如此，尤其证明事情不是如此，就越有智慧。然而，处于良善、被他们鄙视的简单人却能在一瞬间发觉事情的存在，以及它的性质，无需任何争论，更不需要学术论战。这种简单人都有感知真理的普遍意识，而前者却熄灭了这种普遍意识，因为他们想先讨论这种事是否存在。主论及这两种人说，这些事向智慧和聪明人就藏起来，向婴孩就显出来（马太福音<a href="http://39-27.cn/太11.25.htm">11:25</a>；路加福音<a href="http://39-27.cn/路10.21.htm">10:21</a>）。</p>

And they digged another well, and they strove over that also. That this signifies the internal sense of the Word as to whether there is such a thing, is evident from the signification of "another well," 
and of "striving" (concerning which see above), thus from the series; for when those who deny anything, as for instance those who deny the internal sense of the Word, again strive or contend, it must 
needs be as to whether it has any existence. It is known that most disputes at this day go no further; but so long as men remain in debate as to whether a thing is, and whether it is so, they can 
never advance into anything of wisdom; for in the thing itself concerning which they debate there are innumerable things which they can never see so long as they do not acknowledge that thing, because 
in this case they are all the time ignorant of everything that belongs to it. [2] The learning of the present day scarcely passes the point of debating whether a thing has any existence, and whether 
it is thus, or thus; the result of which is that men are shut out from the understanding of truth. For example: he who merely disputes whether there is an internal sense of the Word can never see the 
innumerable, nay, illimitable things which are in the internal sense; and again, he who disputes whether charity is anything in the church, and whether all things of this are not of faith, cannot possibly 
know the innumerable, nay, illimitable things which are in charity, but remains in complete ignorance of what charity is.  [3] The like is the case with the life after death, with the resurrection 
of the dead, with the last judgment, with heaven and with hell-they who merely debate whether these things exist, stand meanwhile outside the doors of wisdom, and are like persons who merely knock, 
and cannot even look into wisdom's magnificent palaces. And yet strange to say such men believe themselves to be wise in comparison with others, and that they are wise in proportion to their ability 
to debate whether a thing be so, and especially to prove that it is not so; when yet the simple who are in good, and whom they despise, can perceive in a moment, without any dispute, much more without 
learned controversy, that the thing is, and what is its quality. These have a common sense of the perception of truth, whereas the former have extinguished this sense by such methods, in desiring first 
of all to discuss whether the thing has any existence. The Lord speaks both of the former and of the latter when He says that things are hidden from the wise and intelligent, and revealed unto babes 
(Matt. 11:25; Luke 10:21). </p>

'And they dug another well and disputed over that also' means whether the internal sense of the Word even exists. This becomes clear from the meaning of 'another well' and of 'disputing', dealt with 
above, and so from the train of thought. For with people who deny the existence of something, such as those who deny the existence of the internal sense of the Word, any subsequent dispute or contention 
can only be about whether that thing exists. It is well known that most disagreements today never get beyond this point. But as long as men are locked in controversy about whether a thing even exists 
and whether it is so, they cannot possibly make any headway into wisdom at all. The thing itself about which they may be arguing includes countless facets which they cannot possibly see as long as 
they do not acknowledge the existence of that thing. For in that case every single aspect of it is unknown to them. </p>
<p></p>
<p><b>[2]</b>
 Learning at the present day does not go much beyond these limits, that is to 
say, beyond discussion of whether a thing exists and is so, and this as a consequence precludes people from an intelligent understanding of truth. For example, anyone who does no more than contend whether 
the internal sense of the Word exists cannot possibly see the countless, indeed unlimited, details which the internal sense contains. Or, anyone who argues whether charity is anything in the Church, 
and whether all things that constitute it are matters of faith, cannot know the countless, indeed unlimited, things which exist within charity. Indeed he remains totally ignorant of what charity is. </p>
<p></p>
<p><b>[3]</b>
It is similar with life after death, the resurrection of the dead, the last judgement, and heaven and hell. Those who do no more than argue whether these exist remain outside the portals to 
wisdom. It is as though they merely knock but are not even able to see into the splendid palaces of wisdom. And what is remarkable, those who act in this way believe that they are wiser than all others, 
and that the wiser they are the better they are able to discern whether a thing is so, and more so to confirm that it is not. Yet simple persons in whom good is present, and whom the former despise, 
are able to discern in an instant that a thing exists, and the nature of it, without any disagreement, let alone learned argument. Such simple people have a common-sense discernment of truth, but the 
former annihilate such common-sense discernment by their wish to discuss first whether such things even exist. The Lord refers to these two groups when He says that things have been hidden from the 
wise and intelligent and have been revealed to infants, <a href="http://bible.gospelcom.net/cgi-bin/bible?passage=Matt%2011:25&amp;version=ESV&amp;interface=print&amp;showfn=yes&amp;showxref">Matt 11:25</a>; <a href="http://bible.gospelcom.net/cgi-bin/bible?passage=Luke%2010:21&amp;version=ESV&amp;interface=print&amp;showfn=yes&amp;showxref">Luke 10:21</a>. </p>

`Et foderunt puteum alium, et rixati etiam super illo': quod significet sensum internum Verbi num sit, constare potest ex significatione `putei alius' et `rixari,' de qua supra, ita ex serie; qui enim 
{1}negant aliquid, ut qui sensum internum Verbi, cum iterum rixantur seu contendunt, non potest esse de alia re quam num sit. Notum {2}est quod pleraeque lites hodie non ulterius vadant; {3}sed quamdiu 
haerent in controversia num sit et num ita sit, nusquam in aliquid sapientiae progressum facere possunt; in ipsa enim re, de qua controvertunt, sunt innumerabilia quae nusquam videre possunt quamdiu 
non illam agnoscunt, nam omnia et singula ejus tunc simul ignorant; [2] eruditio hodierna vix ultra hos limites, nempe num sit {4}et num ita sit, vadit, ideo quoque exclusi ab intelligentia veri stant; 
sicut qui modo contendit num sensus internus Verbi sit, is nusquam videre potest innumerabilia, immo indefinita, quae in sensu interno sunt; {5}et sicut qui litigat num charitas sit aliquid in Ecclesia, 
et annon omnia ejus sint fidei, is innumerabilia, immo indefinita, quae in charitate sunt, non scire potest, immo prorsus in ignorantia manet quid charitas; ]3\ similiter se habet cum vita post 
mortem, cum resurrectione mortuorum, cum ultimo judicio, cum caelo et cum inferno; qui modo disputant num sint, illi tamdiu extra fores sapientiae sunt, et sunt veluti qui modo pulsant, et {7}in palatia 
magnifica sapientiae ne quidem introspicere possunt; et quod {8}mirandum, tales qui ita faciunt, se prae aliis sapientes esse credunt, et eo sapientiores quo melius disserere possunt num ita sit, 
et magis confirmare quod non ita, cum tamen simplices qui in bono sunt, quos contemnunt, absque aliqua lite, minus controversia docta, appercipere possunt momento quod sit et quale sit; hi sensum apperceptionis 
veri communem habent, illi autem sensum illum per talia quae prius discutere volunt an sit, exstinxerunt; de his et de illis Dominus loquitur, cum dicit,           Quod abscondita sint sapientibus 
et intelligentibus, et      revelata infantibus, Matth. xi 25; Luc. x 21. @1 i prorsus$  @2 i enim$  @3 et$  @4 vel$  @5 vel quoque, qui litigat, num charitas sit essentiale Ecclesiae, vel 
num fides$  @6 i imo$  @7 ne quidem in palatia magnificentissima$  @8 mirum$  </p>
