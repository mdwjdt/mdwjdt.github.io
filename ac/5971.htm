<h3 align="center" class="ired">属天的奥秘 第5971节</h3>
<h4 align="center"></h4><p><strong>5971.</strong>“他又看见约瑟打发来接他的车辆”表由此所获得的让人信服的教义事物。这从“车辆”、“约瑟打发来”和“接他”的含义清楚可知：“车辆”是指教义事物（参看<a href="5945.htm">5945</a>，<a href="5952.htm">5952</a>节）；“约瑟打发来”是指来自内在属天层的东西；“接他”是指让人信服的东西，因为接他到约瑟那里去，好叫他看见约瑟表示使人信服。此外，他一看见车辆就确信不疑，这一点从接下来的话明显看出来，即：“他们父亲雅各的灵就苏醒了。以色列说，够了！我的儿子约瑟还活着”。</p>

And he saw the carts which Joseph had sent to carry him. That this signifies doctrinal things thence derived which might persuade, is evident from the signification of "carts," as being doctrinal things 
(see n. 5945, 5952); from the signification of "which Joseph had sent," as being which were from the internal celestial; and from the signification of "to carry him," as being which might persuade; 
for to carry him to Joseph that he might see him denotes to persuade. Moreover that he was persuaded by seeing the carts is evident from the words which now follow, namely, "the spirit of Jacob their 
father revived; and Israel said, It is much; Joseph my son is yet alive." </p>

'And he saw the carts which Joseph had sent to carry him' means matters of doctrine received from this which might prove convincing. This is clear from the meaning of 'the carts' as matters of doctrine, 
dealt with in <a href="5945.htm">5945</a>, <a href="5952.htm">5952</a>; from the meaning of 'which Joseph sent' as which come from the internal celestial; and from the meaning of 'to carry him' as which might prove convincing, for carrying him 
to Joseph so that he may see him means to convince. And once he had seen the carts he was indeed convinced, as is clear from the words which immediately follow, </p>
<p>The spirit of Jacob their father revived, 
and Israel said, Enough; Joseph my son is still alive. </p>

`Et vidit vehicula quae misit Josephus ad ferendum illum': quod significet doctrinalia inde quae persuaderent, constat ex significatione `vehiculorum' quod sint doctrinalia, de qua n. 5945, 5952; ex 
significatione `quae misit Josephus' quod sit quae a caelesti interno; et a significatione `ad ferendum illum' quod sit quae persuaderent, nam ferre (c)eum ad Josephum ut videat eum, est persuadere; 
quod etiam ex visis vehiculis persuasus fuerit, (c)ex verbis quae nunc sequuntur, nempe,  revixit spiritus Jacobi patris illorum, et dixit Israel, Multum, adhuc Joseph filius meus vivit', constat. </p>
