<h3 align="center" class="ired">属天的奥秘 第2173节</h3>
<h4 align="center"></h4><p><strong>2173.</strong>“撒拉”在此是指主的真理。这从“撒拉”的代表清楚可知，“撒拉”是指与良善结合的智性真理，在此是指理性真理，原因和上述亚伯拉罕的一样。关于“撒拉”代表真理，可参看前文（<a href="1468.htm">1468</a>，<a href="1901.htm">1901</a>，<a href="2063.htm">2063</a>，<a href="2065.htm">2065</a>节） 。在圣言的历史部分，良善与真理只能由婚姻来代表，因为这是它们真实的情形。属天事物和属灵事物之间存在一个神圣婚姻，或可说，爱的事物和信的事物之间存在一个神圣婚姻，也可说，意愿的事物和理解力的事物之间存在一个神圣婚姻。意愿的事物是良善的形式，理解力的事物是真理的形式。主在天上的国度和地上的国度（即教会）里面就有这样的婚姻；每个人及其每一个事物，甚至最个体的部分里面也有这样的婚姻。凡没有这种婚姻的，就没有任何生命可言。事实上，这种婚姻通过神圣婚姻而存在于整个自然界及其一切细节（尽管是以不同的形状和形式出现）中。否则，没有任何事物能在那里持续存在下去。由于一切事物里面都有这样的婚姻，故先知书，尤其以赛亚书以双重表述描述一切事物：一种表述涉及属天事物或良善，另一种表述涉及属灵事物或真理（参看<a href="683.htm">683</a>，<a href="793.htm">793</a>，<a href="801.htm">801</a>节）。一切事物里面都有一个婚姻的形像（参看<a href="718.htm">718</a>，<a href="747.htm">747</a>，<a href="917.htm">917</a>，<a href="1432.htm">1432</a>节）。这解释了为何“亚伯拉罕”代表主的良善，“撒拉”代表主的真理。</p>

That "Sarah" is here the Lord as to truth, is evident from the representation of Sarah, as being intellectual truth adjoined to good; here, as being rational truth, for the same reason as just now stated 
in regard to Abraham. (That Sarah represents truth may be seen above, n. 1468, 1901, 2063, 2065). In the historicals of the Word good and truth cannot be represented otherwise than by a marriage, 
for this is really the case with them, for there is a Divine marriage between things celestial and spiritual, or what is the same, between those which are of love and those which are of faith, or again 
what is the same, between those of the will and those of the understanding. The former are of good, the latter are of truth. There is such a marriage in the Lord's kingdom in the heavens; such also 
in the Lord's kingdom on the earth (that is, in the church); such a marriage in every man, in every single thing of him, nay, in the veriest singulars of all. That which is not in such a marriage does 
not live. Nay, from that Divine marriage there is such a marriage in universal nature, and in every particular of it, but under other form and appearance, otherwise nothing whatever would there subsist. 
Because there is such marriage in everything, therefore with the Prophets every matter is expressed in a twofold manner, especially in Isaiah-one expression referring to what is celestial, or to 
good, and the other to what is spiritual, or to truth (see n. 683, 793, 801). That in everything there is a resemblance of a marriage, may be seen above (n. 718, 747, 917, 1432). Hence it is that the 
Lord's good is represented by Abraham, and His truth by Sarah. </p>

That 'Sarah' here is the Lord as regards truth is clear from the representation of 'Sarah' as intellectual truth allied to good, and here as rational truth, for the same reason as has just been stated 
in reference to 'Abraham'; for 'Sarah' represents truth, see what has been stated already in <a href="1468.htm">1468</a>, <a href="1901.htm">1901</a>, <a href="2063.htm">2063</a>, <a href="2065.htm">2065</a> In the historical sections of the Word good and truth cannot be represented by anything 
other than a marriage, for they go together as two that are married. Indeed a Divine Marriage exists between celestial and spiritual things, or what amounts to the same, between the things of love 
and those of faith; or what still amounts to the same, between things of the will and those of the understanding. Those of the will are forms of good, those of the understanding forms of truth. Such 
a marriage exists in the Lord's kingdom in heaven, and such also exists in the Lord's kingdom on earth, which is the Church. Such a marriage exists in every individual, and in each part of him, indeed 
in the most individual parts of all. That which does not have its existence within such a marriage has no life. Indeed from this Divine Marriage such a marriage exists in the entire natural order and 
in each individual part of it- though it does so under a different shape and form - otherwise nothing would ever continue to exist there. Because such a marriage exists in each individual part, everything 
is described in the Prophets, especially in Isaiah, by a pair of expressions. The one expression has to do with that which is celestial or with good, the other with that which is spiritual or 
with truth, dealt with in <a href="683.htm">683</a>, <a href="793.htm">793</a>, <a href="801.htm">801</a>. As regards the likeness of a marriage being present in every individual part, see <a href="718.htm">718</a>, <a href="747.htm">747</a>, <a href="917.htm">917</a>, <a href="1432.htm">1432</a>. This explains why 'Abraham' represents the Lord's good, 
and 'Sarah' His truth. </p>

Quod `Sarah' sit hic Dominus quoad verum, constat (c)ex repraesentatione `Sarae' quod sit verum intellectuale adjunctum bono, hic quod sit verum rationale, ex eadem causa, ut modo de `Abrahamo' dictum; 
quod `Sarah' repraesentet verum, videatur prius n. 1468, 1901, 2063, 2065; bonum et verum in historicis Verbi non aliter possunt quam repraesentari per `conjugium,' se enim ita habent; est enim Divinum 
Conjugium inter caelestia et spiritualia; seu quod idem, inter illa quae sunt amoris et quae sunt fidei; seu quod adhuc idem, inter illa quae sunt voluntatis et intellectus; illa sunt boni, haec 
sunt veri: tale conjugium est in regno Domini in caelis, tale etiam in regno Domini in terris seu in Ecclesia, tale in unoquovis homine, in singulis ejus, immo in omnium singularissimis; quae non in 
tali conjugio sunt, non vivunt; immo tale conjugium inde est in universa natura inque singulis ejus, sed sub alia forma et specie, alioquin nihil usquam ibi subsisteret: quia tale `conjugium est' in singulis, 
apud Prophetas unaquaevis res duplici modo exprimitur, imprimis apud Esaiam, et una expressio se refert ad caeleste seu bonum, altera ad spirituale seu verum, de quo n. 683, 793, 801: quod sit 
instar conjugii in singulis, videatur n. 718, 747, 917, 1432; (m)inde est quod per `Abrahamum' repraesentetur bonum Domini et per `Sarah' verum.(n) </p>
