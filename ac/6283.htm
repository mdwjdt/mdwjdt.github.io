<h3 align="center" class="ired">属天的奥秘 第6283节</h3>
<h4 align="center"></h4><p><strong>6283.</strong>“愿他们称为我名下”表他们里面要有来自属世层的属灵真理之良善的品质。这从“称为某人名下”的含义和“以色列”的代表清楚可知：“称为某人名下”是指一个在另一个里面的品质（参看<a href="1754.htm">1754</a>，<a href="1896.htm">1896</a>，<a href="2009.htm">2009</a>，<a href="3421.htm">3421</a>节）；“以色列”是指来自属世层的属灵真理的良善，如前所述（<a href="6277.htm">6277</a>节）。由于以色列的品质在他们里面，所以他们也在雅各的其他儿子们当中被接纳，并成为两个支派，一个是玛拿西支派，另一个是以法莲支派。当利未支派因做祭司而未算在拈阄分地地业的支派当中时（参看约书亚记，以及以西结书48章），他们与其它支派构成十二支派。</p>

And let my name be called in them. That this signifies that in them should be the quality of the good of spiritual truth from the natural, is evident from the signification of the "name being called 
in" anyone, as being his quality in him (see n. 1754, 1896, 2009, 3421); and from the representation of Israel, as being the good of spiritual truth from the natural (of which above, n. 6277); and because 
the quality of Israel was in them, therefore they also were received among the rest of the sons of Jacob, and were made tribes, one of Manasseh and the other of Ephraim, and with them the twelve 
tribes were made up, when the tribe of Levi, being made the priesthood, was not numbered among the tribes that obtained inheritance by lot (see Joshua and also Ezekiel 48). </p>

<p align="center"><b>Elliott(1983-1999) 6283</b></p><p><b>6283.</b>
'And in them will my name be called' means that in them the essential nature of the good of spiritual truth from the natural will be present. This is clear from the meaning of 'one's name being called 
in another' as the essential nature of one in the other, dealt with in <a href="1754.htm">1754</a>, <a href="1896.htm">1896</a>, <a href="2009.htm">2009</a>, <a href="3421.htm">3421</a>; and from the representation of 'Israel' as the good of spiritual truth from the natural, dealt with above 
in <a href="6277.htm">6277</a>. And since they had within them Israel's essential nature they were accepted among the rest of Jacob's sons and became tribes, one the tribe of Manasseh, the other the tribe of Ephraim. Along 
with the rest - though excluding the tribe of Levi because it became the priesthood - they made up the twelve tribes when inheritances were allotted to them, as described in Joshua and also Ezekiel <a href="48.htm">48</a>. </p>

<p align="center"><b>Latin(1748-1756) 6283</b>
</p><b>6283.</b>
`Et vocabitur in illis nomen meum':  quod significet quod in illis quale boni veri spiritualis e naturali, constat ex significatione `vocari nomen suum in aliquo' quod sit quale ejus in illo, de qua 
n. 1754, 1896, 2009, 3421; et ex repraesentatione `Israelis' quod sit bonum veri spiritualis e naturali, de qua supra n. 6277; et quia quale Israelis erat in illis, ideo etiam inter reliquos Jacobi filios 
recepti sunt et facti tribus, una Menashis et altera Ephraimi, et cum illis constituebant duodecim tribus quando tribus Levi quia sacerdotium facta, non numerata est, {1}quae hereditatem sortitae 
sunt, de qua apud Joshuam, et quoque apud Ezechielem xlviii. @1 ut cum Tribus$ </p>
