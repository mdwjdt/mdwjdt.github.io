<h3 align="center" class="ired">属天的奥秘 第451节</h3>
<h4 align="center"></h4><p><strong>451.</strong>某个精灵在世时曾位高权重，进入灵界后依然有发号施令的欲望。但他被告知，如今他进入了另一个国度，该国度是永恒的；他在地上的权力已经结束了；在这新的国度，人是凭良善与真理，以及他所接受的主的仁慈而受到尊敬。他还被告知，现在的国度和尘世的一样，每个人都根据其财富和对权力的渴望被评定；在这里，善与真是财富，对权力的渴望是主的仁慈；若他想以别的方式发号施令，那么他就是一个叛逆者，因为如今他在另一个国度。听到这番话，他羞愧难当。</p>

<p><strong>[NCE]451.</strong> One man who had been more influential than others during bodily life retained his desire for power in the other life. I told him that he was in another realm — an eternal one — and that the power he had exercised on earth was dead. "Here," I said, "the only standard by which people are evaluated is the amount of goodness and truth and of the Lord's mercy they possess.<br />"The situation in this realm," I added, "is just like that on earth, where people acquire status only through wealth or through favor with the head of state. Wealth in this kingdom is goodness and truth, and the ruler's good favor is the Lord's mercy. If you want any other kind of influence, you're a rebel, because you are in Another's realm." On hearing these things, the man burned with shame. </p>

A certain spirit, who during his life in the body had possessed authority, retained in the other life the desire to exercise command. But he was told that he was now in another kingdom, which is eternal; 
that his rule on earth was dead; and that where he was now no one is held in estimation except in accordance with the good and truth, and the mercy of the Lord, in which he is; and further, that 
it is in that kingdom as it is on earth, where everyone is rated according to his wealth, and his favor with his sovereign; and that there good and truth are wealth, and favor with the sovereign is the 
Lord's mercy; and that if he desired to exercise command in any other way, he was a rebel, seeing that he was now in the kingdom of another. On hearing this he was ashamed. </p>

<p align="center"><b>Elliott(1983-1999) 451</b></p><p><b>451.</b>
There was a certain man who during his lifetime had had authority over others, and in the next life he persisted in the desire to command. He was told that he was now in a different realm, one that was 
eternal, and that his command on earth had come to an end. Where he was now people estimated an individual solely on the basis of the good and truth, and of the Lord's mercy as received by him. He 
was also told that this kingdom resembled that on earth where without exception a person's wealth, and his favour with his sovereign, determine his position. Here, he was told, wealth consists in good 
and truth, and favour with the sovereign in the Lord's mercy. If he sought any other kind of command he was a rebel, for he was now in Another's kingdom. On hearing all this he was ashamed of himself.  </p>

</p><b>451.</b>
Quidam qui in vita corporis potens fuit prae aliis, in altera vita retinuit quod etiam imperare vellet; cui dictum quod in alio regno sit, quod aeternum et quod imperare ejus in terra mortuum sit; et 
quod nunc non aestimetur quisquam quam secundum bonum et verum et secundum misericordia Domini, in qua sit; tum, quod regnum hoc se habeat sicut in terra, ubi nullus aestimatur nisi propter opes, et 
propter gratiam apud principem; opes hic sunt bonum et verum, et gratia apud principem est misericordia Domini; si aliter velit imperare, rebellis est, nam in alius regno est: his audit pudefactus est. </p>
