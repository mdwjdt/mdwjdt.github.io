<h3 align="center" class="ired">属天的奥秘 第8472节</h3>
<h4 align="center"></h4><p><strong>8472.</strong>“收集它，有多收的，有少收的”表照每个社群的能力领受。这从“收集”和“多收的，少收的”的含义清楚可知：“收集”是指领受（参看<a href="8467.htm">8467</a>节）；“多收的，少收的”是指照每个社群的能力。这一切的性质都必须从发生在天堂社群里的事推断出来。“吗哪”是指天上的食物，天上的食物是良善和真理，天上的良善和真理就是主，因为它们来自主。由此可见，关于吗哪的这些规定描述了发生在上述社群里的那类事。它们描述了从主发出的神性良善如何与天上的所有人共享，如何具体地、总体地与所有人共享，但每个地方都照着领受它的能力；因为有些人只能领受少许，有些人则能领受很多。那些只能领受少许的人在天堂的边缘，而那些能领受很多的人则在天堂的内部。那里每个人的领受能力取决于他在世上所获得的良善的质和量。“多”和“少”所表示的，就是这种能力上的差别。</p>

And they gathered, collecting for the numerous and for the few. That this signifies reception according to the power of each society, is evident from the signification of "gathering," as being to receive 
(see above, n. 8467); and from the signification of "collecting for the numerous and for the few," as being according to the power of each society. How these things are, must be unfolded from those 
which come forth in the societies in heaven; for "the manna" denotes heavenly food, and heavenly food is good and truth, and good and truth in heaven are the Lord, because from Him. From all this it 
can be seen that these things which were decreed about the manna, are such as come forth in the said societies. The case herein is that the Divine good which proceeds from the Lord is communicated to 
all in heaven universally and individually, but everywhere according to the power of receiving; for there are those who receive little, and there are those who receive much. They who receive little 
are in the borders of heaven, but they who receive much are in the interiors. Everyone there has a power of receiving according to the nature and amount of good acquired in the world. The difference in 
power is what is signified by the terms "numerous" and "few." </p>

<p align="center"><b>Elliott(1983-1999) 8472</b></p><p><b>8472.</b>
'And gathered it, [each] collecting it for a large number or for a few' means receiving according to the capacity of each community. This is clear from the meaning of 'gathering' as receiving, as above 
in <a href="8467.htm">8467</a>; and from the meaning of '[each] collecting for a large number or for a few' as according to the capacity of each community. The nature of all this has to be deduced from the things that take 
place in communities in heaven. Manna is heavenly food, heavenly food is goodness and truth, and goodness and truth in heaven are the Lord since they come from Him. From all this it becomes clear that 
these stipulations regarding the manna describe the kinds of things that occur in the communities mentioned. They describe how Divine Good which emanates from the Lord is shared with all in heaven, 
with all in particular and in general, but everywhere according to the capacity to receive it, for there are those who can receive only little and there are those who can receive much. Those who can 
receive only little are on the borders of heaven, whereas those who can receive much are in the inner parts there. Each person's capacity to receive is determined by the nature and amount of good he 
acquired in the world. Differences in that power are what are meant by 'a large number' end 'a few'. </p>

`Et collegerunt redigens ad numerosum et ad paucum': quod significet receptionem secundum potentiam cujusvis societatis, constat ex significatione `colligere' quod sit recipere, ut supra n. 8467, et 
ex significatione `redigens ad numerosum et ad paucum' quod sit secundum potentiam cujusvis societatis.  Quomodo haec se habent, evolvendum est ex illis quae existunt in societatibus in caelo, nam manna 
est cibus caelestis, et cibus caelestis est bonum et verum, ac bonum et verum in caelo est Dominus, quia ab Ipso; ex {1}his constare potest quod haec quae de manna statuta sunt sint talia quae in 
dictis societatibus existunt; cum his ita se habet: Divinum Bonum quod a Domino procedit communicatur cum omnibus in caelo universaliter et singulariter, sed ubivis secundum potentiam recipiendi, sunt 
enim qui parum recipiunt, et sunt qui multum; qui parum recipiunt sunt in terminis caeli, at qui multum sunt in interioribus ibi; quisque ibi in potentia recipiendi est secundum quale et quantum boni 
in mundo acquisiti; potentiae differentia est quae significatur per `numerosum' et `paucum.' 	@1 quibus$ </p>
