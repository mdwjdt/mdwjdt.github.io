<h3 align="center" class="ired">属天的奥秘 第2873节</h3>
<h4 align="center"></h4><p><strong>2873.</strong>天堂自由（它来自对良善与真理的情感）距离地狱自由（它来自对邪恶与虚假的情感）何等遥远，这从以下事实明显看出来：一想到诸如来自对邪恶与虚假的情感，或也可说，来自爱自我和这个世界的欲望之类的自由，天上的天使就会立刻被内在的痛苦攫住；而另一方面，一想到诸如来自对良善与真理的情感，或也可说，来自相爱的渴望之类的自由，恶灵便立刻感到剧痛。值得注意的是，这种自由与那种自由如此对立，以致爱自我和这个世界的自由对善灵来说就是地狱；相反，爱主和相爱的自由对恶灵来说也是地狱。因此，在来世，所有人都是根据其自由的种类，或也可说，根据其爱与情感，因而根据其生命的快乐，也就是根据其生活来划分的。因为生活无非是快乐，而这些快乐无非是属于这些爱的情感。</p>

<p align="center"><b>Potts(1905-1910) 2873</b></p><p><b>2873.</b>
How far distant heavenly freedom (which is from the affection of good and truth) is from infernal freedom (which is from the affection of evil and falsity), is evident from the fact that when the angels 
in heaven merely think about such freedom as is from the affection of evil and falsity, or what is the same, from the cupidities of the love of self and the world, they are immediately seized with 
internal pain; and on the other hand, when evil spirits merely think about the freedom which is from the affection of good and truth, or what is the same, from the desires of mutual love, they at once 
come into anguish; and what is wonderful, so opposite is the one freedom to the other, that the freedom of the love of self and the world is hell to good spirits; and on the other hand, the freedom 
of love to the Lord and mutual love is hell to evil spirits. Hence all in the other life are distinct according to their kinds of freedom, or what is the same, according to their loves and affections, 
consequently according to the delights of their life, which is the same as according to their lives; for lives are nothing else than delights, and these are nothing else than affections which are of 
the loves. </p>

<p align="center"><b>Elliott(1983-1999) 2873</b></p><p><b>2873.</b>
Just how far removed heavenly freedom is which flows from the affection for good and truth from the freedom of hell which flows from the affection for evil and falsity becomes clear from the fact that 
angels in heaven are instantly seized by pain within at the mere thought of such freedom as flows from the affection for evil and falsity, or what amounts to the same, from the desires that belong to 
self-love and love of the world. And conversely at the mere thought of the freedom that flows from the affection for good and truth, or what amounts to the same, from the desires that belong to mutual 
love, evil spirits instantly feel intense pains. And what is remarkable, the one type of freedom is so much the contrary of the other that for good spirits the freedom which goes with self-love and 
love of the world is hell, while conversely for evil spirits the freedom that goes with love to the Lord and with mutual love is hell. Therefore all in the next life are distinguished according to their 
different kinds of freedom, or what amounts to the same, according to their different kinds of love and affection, and consequently according to their delights of life, which is the same as saying 
according to their lives, since people's lives consist in nothing else than delights, and these delights in nothing else than the affections which go with people's loves. </p>

</p><b>2873.</b>
Quantum distat liberum caeleste, quod est ex affectione boni et veri, a libero infernali, quod est ex affectione mali et falsi, constare potest inde quod angeli qui in caelis, dummodo cogitant de libero 
tali quod est ex affectione mali et falsi, seu quod idem, ex cupiditatibus amoris sui et mundi, ilico corripiantur dolore interno; et vicissim, cum spiritus mali modo cogitant de libero quod est 
ex affectione boni et veri, seu quod idem, ex desideriis amoris mutui, ilico in angores veniunt; et mirum, ita oppositum est unum liberum alteri ut liberum amoris sui et mundi sit spiritibus bonis infernum, 
et vicissim, liberum amoris in Dominum et amoris mutui sit spiritibus malis infernum:  inde distincti sunt omnes in altera vita secundum libera, seu quod idem est, secundum amores et affectiones, 
consequenter secundum jucunda vitae, quod idem est ac secundum vitas; nam vitae non aliud sunt quam jucunda, et haec non aliud quam affectiones quae sunt amorum. </p>
