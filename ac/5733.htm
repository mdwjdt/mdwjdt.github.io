<h3 align="center" class="ired">属天的奥秘 第5733节</h3>
<h4 align="center"></h4><p><strong>5733.</strong>“把粮食装满这些人的口袋”表进入属世层，带来真理之良善。这从“口袋”和“粮食”的含义清楚可知：“口袋”是指外层属世层（参看<a href="5497.htm">5497</a>节）；“粮食”是指真理之良善（<a href="5340.htm">5340</a>，<a href="5342.htm">5342</a>，<a href="5410.htm">5410</a>，<a href="5426.htm">5426</a>，<a href="5487.htm">5487</a>，<a href="5582.htm">5582</a>，<a href="5588.htm">5588</a>，<a href="5655.htm">5655</a>节）。从这些含义明显可知，“约瑟吩咐管家的说，把粮食装满这些人的口袋”表示来自它自己的流注进入属世层，带来真理之良善。由于“真理之良善”和“良善之真理”这两个词经常出现，故有必要阐述这二者之间的区别。人若不知道相对于属灵教会，属天教会是什么样，绝无可能知道这种区别。良善之真理是属天教会的特征，真理之良善是属灵教会的特征。对属天教会成员来说，良善被植入心智的意愿部分，就是适合良善的位置。他们从该良善，也就是通过从主所领受的良善拥有对真理的觉知；因此，他们拥有良善之真理。但对属灵教会成员来说，良善通过真理被植入心智的理解力部分；因为一切真理皆属于理解力。他们通过真理被引向良善，因为对这些人来说，良善就在于将真理付诸实践；因此，他们拥有真理之良善。确切地说，这两种教会的情况就是这样；但良善之真理也归于那些属于属灵教会的人，即便严格来说，他们并不拥有它；至于原因，我们将在别处予以讨论。</p>

Fill the men's bags with food. That this signifies into the natural with the good of truth, is evident from the signification of a "bag," as being the exterior natural (see n. 5497); and from the signification 
of "food," as being the good of truth (n. 5340, 5342, 5410, 5426, 5487, 5582, 5588, 5655). From this it is plain that by his "commanding him that was over his house to fill the men's bags with 
food" is signified influx from himself into the natural with the good of truth. As the expressions "good of truth" and "truth of good" frequently occur, the difference between them shall be stated. 
He who does not know what the celestial church is relatively to the spiritual church, cannot possibly know this difference. The truth of good is of the celestial church, and the good of truth is of 
the spiritual church. With those who were of the celestial church, good was implanted in the will part, which is the proper seat of good, and from this good, that is, through this good from the Lord, 
they had a perception of truth; hence they had the truth of good. But with those who are of the spiritual church, good is implanted in the intellectual part by means of truth, for all truth is of the 
intellectual part, and through truth they are led to good, to do truth being their good; hence they have the good of truth. The latter is properly predicated of those who are of the spiritual church; 
yet the truth of good, although not properly, is also predicated of them, of which more will be said elsewhere. </p>

'Fill the men's pouches with food' means into the natural, bringing the good of truth. This is clear from the meaning of 'pouch' as the exterior natural, dealt with in <a href="5497.htm">5497</a>, and from the meaning of 'food' 
as the good of truth, dealt with in <a href="5340.htm">5340</a>, <a href="5342.htm">5342</a>, <a href="5410.htm">5410</a>, <a href="5426.htm">5426</a>, <a href="5487.htm">5487</a>, <a href="5582.htm">5582</a>, <a href="5588.htm">5588</a>, <a href="5655.htm">5655</a>. From these meanings it is evident that 'he commanded the one who was over his house, Fill the men's pouches with 
food' means an influx from itself into the natural, bringing the good of truth. Since the expressions 'the good of truth' and 'the truth of good' occur rather often, the difference between the two 
should be stated. Anyone unacquainted with what the celestial Church is when compared with the spiritual Church cannot possibly know the difference. The truth of good is a characteristic of the celestial 
Church, the good of truth a characteristic of the spiritual Church. With members of the celestial Church good was implanted in the will part of the mind, the proper place for good to be seated. From 
that good - that is, through that good received from the Lord - they had a perception of truth; that is why the truth of good resided with them. But with members of the spiritual Church good is implanted 
in the understanding part of the mind, by means of truth; for all truth belongs in the understanding. They are led by means of truth towards good, for good consists for these people in putting 
truth into practice, which is why the good of truth resides with them. This is the situation, properly speaking, with those two Churches; but the truth of good is also attributed to those who belong to 
the spiritual Church, even though they are not properly speaking in possession of it, for reasons which will be discussed elsewhere. </p>

`Imple manticas virorum cibo':  quod significet in naturale cum bono veri, constat ex significatione `manticae' quod sit exterius naturale, de qua n. 5497; et ex significatione `cibi' quod sit bonum 
veri, de qua n. 5340, 5342, 5410, 5426, 5487, 5582, 5588, 5655; ex his patet quod per `praecepit illi qui super domo sua, Imple manticas virorum cibo' significetur influxus a se in naturale cum bono 
veri.  Quia saepius occurrit bonum veri, et boni verum, dicendum quae differentia: qui non novit quid caelestis Ecclesia est respective ad spiritualem Ecclesiam, is nequaquam scire potest differentiam; 
boni verum est Ecclesiae caelestis, et bonum veri est Ecclesiae spiritualis; {1}apud illos qui ab Ecclesia caelesti, implantatum fuit bonum in parte voluntaria {2}ubi propria sedes boni; ex bono illo, 
hoc est, per bonum {3}illud a Domino, habuerunt perceptionem veri, inde illis boni verum; {4}at apud illos qui ab Ecclesia spirituali, implantatur bonum in parte intellectuali per verum, nam omne  
verum est partis intellectualis, et per verum ducuntur ad bonum,  nam facere verum est illis bonum, inde illis bonum veri; {5}haec proprie, at boni verum tametsi non proprie, etiam praedicatur de illis 
qui ab Ecclesia spirituali sunt; de qua re alibi. @1 Ecclesia enim caelestis quia bonum illis qui ab illa Ecclesia$ @2 inde illis bonum etiam ex proprio suo$ @3 id$ @4 Ecclesia autem spiritualis 
quia bonum illis qui ab illa Ecclesia$ @5 verbo bonum ex vero, seu bonum veri est Ecclesiae spiritualis, at bonum ex quo verum seu boni verum est Ecclesiae caelestis; (m) hoc in specie, at in communi 
etiam boni verum praedicari potest de Ecclesia spirituali(n)$ </p>
