<h3 align="center" class="ired">属天的奥秘 第2839节</h3>
<h4 align="center"></h4><p><strong>2839.</strong>“在耶和华的山上必看顾”表仁爱，他们，即属灵之人藉着主所提供的仁爱而得救。这从“山”的含义清楚可知，“山”是指爱与仁（参看<a href="795.htm">795</a>，<a href="796.htm">796</a>，<a href="1430.htm">1430</a>节）。“耶和华必看顾”表主的规定，或主所规定的事，如刚才所述（<a href="2837.htm">2837</a>节）。此处论及的是仁，而非爱，因为仁与爱是有区别的（参看<a href="2023.htm">2023</a>节）。属灵之人凭借仁，而非脱离仁之信而得救，这从圣言中的许多经文明显看出来。关于仁与信，情况乃是这样：无信之仁并非真正的仁，无仁之信并非信。哪里有仁的存在，哪里必有信的存在；哪里有信的存在，哪里必有仁的存在。然而，绝对的本质是仁，因为作为信的种子无法植根于任何其它土壤。天上的婚姻，就是主的国，就来自这二者相互共同的结合。信若非植根于仁，不过是知识，它不会超越记忆层面，因为内心没有接受它的情感。但当植根于仁，也就是生活时，信就变成了聪明和智慧。无信之仁，诸如小孩子和正直的外邦人所具有的那种，仅仅是信被植入的土壤，即便今生没有被植入，来世也会被植入。</p>

In the mountain Jehovah will see. That this signifies charity, by means of which it is provided by the Lord that they should be saved, namely, the spiritual, is evident from the signification of a "mountain," 
as being love and charity (see n. 795, 796, 1430). That "Jehovah will see" denotes the Lord's providence, or what is provided by the Lord, was said just above (n. 2837). Here charity is spoken 
of, and not love, on account of the difference between charity and love (see n. 2023). That the spiritual are saved by charity, and not by faith separate from charity, is evident from many passages 
in the Word. With charity and with faith the case is this: charity without faith is not genuine charity, and faith without charity is not faith. That there may be charity, there must be faith; and that 
there may be faith, there must be charity; but the essential itself is charity; for in no other ground can the seed which is faith be implanted. From the conjunction of the two mutually and reciprocally 
is the heavenly marriage, that is, the Lord's kingdom. Unless faith is implanted in charity it is mere memory-knowledge; for it goes no further than the memory; there is no affection of the heart 
which receives it; but when it is implanted in charity, that is, in the life, it becomes intelligence and wisdom. Charity without faith, such as is with children and with upright Gentiles, is only ground 
in which faith is implanted-if not in the life of the body, still in the other life (see n. 1802, 2280, 2290-2309, 2419, 2589-2604). </p>

'On the mountain Jehovah will see [to it]' means charity by means of which provision was made by the Lord for them, that is, for those who are spiritual, to be saved. This is clear from the meaning of 
'the mountain' as love and charity, dealt with in <a href="795.htm">795</a>, <a href="796.htm">796</a>, <a href="1430.htm">1430</a>. The expression 'Jehovah will see [to it]' is the Lord's Providence, or provision made by the Lord, as has been stated just above in <a href="2837.htm">2837</a>. Here charity is referred to, not love, on account of the difference that exists between charity and love, dealt with in <a href="2023.htm">2023</a>. As regards spiritual people being saved by means of charity, not by 
means of faith separated from charity, this is clear from many places in the Word. The situation with regard to charity and to faith is this: Charity devoid of faith is not genuine charity, and faith 
devoid of charity is not faith. For charity to be real, faith must be present; and for faith to be real, charity must be present. The absolute essential however is charity, for that seed which is faith 
cannot be implanted in any other ground. From their being joined together through each reaching out and responding to the other, the heavenly marriage, that is, the Lord's kingdom, has its being. Unless 
faith exists implanted in charity it is merely knowledge, for it does not go beyond the memory, there being no affection in the heart to receive it. But when implanted in charity, that is, in life, 
faith becomes intelligence and wisdom. Charity devoid of faith, like that existing with young children and with gentiles who are upright, is simply the ground in which faith is implanted, if not in 
this life then in the next life, see <a href="802.htm">802</a>, <a href="2280.htm">2280</a>, <a href="2289.htm">2289</a>-<a href="2309.htm">2309</a>, <a href="2417.htm">2417</a>, <a href="2589.htm">2589</a>-<a href="2604.htm">2604</a>. </p>

`In monte Jehovah videbit': quod significet charitatem, per quam a Domino provisum ut salventur, nempe spirituales, constat ex significatione `montis' quod sit amor et charitas, de qua n. 795, 796, 
1430; quod `Jehovah videbit' sit Domini Providentia, seu a Domino provisum, mox supra n. 2837 dictum est:  hic charitas dicitur, non amor, ob differentiam quae est inter charitatem et amorem, de qua n. 
2023.  Quod spirituales per charitatem {1}salventur, non per fidem separatam a charitate, constat ex multis locis in Verbo: ita se habet cum charitate et cum fide; charitas absque fide non est {2}genuina 
charitas, et fides absque charitate non est {3}fides; ut charitas sit, erit fides, et ut fides, erit charitas, at ipsum essentiale est charitas, non enim alii humo implantari potest semen quod est 
fides; ex conjunctione unius et alterius mutuo et vicissim est conjugium caeleste, hoc est, regnum Domini; fides nisi implantata charitati est mere scientia, non enim vadit e memoria ulterius, nam 
nulla est affectio cordis quae recipit; {4}at fit intelligentia et sapientia cum implantatur charitati, hoc est, vitae; charitas absque fide, qualis apud infantes et apud probos gentiles, est modo humus 
cui implantatur fides, si non in vita corporis, usque in altera vita, videatur n. 1802, 2280, 2289-2309, 2417, 2589-2604. @1 after charitate$ @2 A had aliqua, d and i genuina, d and marks aliqua
