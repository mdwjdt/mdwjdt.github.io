<h3 align="center" class="ired">属天的奥秘 第4423节</h3>
<h4 align="center"></h4><p><strong>4423.</strong>几乎没有人知道当一个教会被抛弃，一个新教会被采用时是何情形。人若不知道人的内层及其状态，因而不知道人死后的状态，必断定，那些属于旧教会，良善与真理在里面已经被毁，也就是不再被发自内心承认的人要么如被洪水灭亡的大洪前之人，要么如从他们的本地被逐出的犹太人那样，或以某种其它方式而行将灭亡。在这种情况下，天堂，因而主会远离它们，并转到其他人那里，这些人会被吸纳以取代它们。因为若地上某个地方没有一个教会，天堂与人类的联系就不存在；事实上，教会就像大人在地上的心与肺（参看<a href="468.htm">468</a>，<a href="637.htm">637</a>，<a href="931.htm">931</a>，<a href="2054.htm">2054</a>，<a href="2853.htm">2853</a>节）。<br />那些此时属于旧教会，因而远离天堂之人的内层就陷入一种洪水当中；事实上，这洪水漫过头顶。活在肉身期间，人对这洪水一无所知，但死后却进入其中。在来世，这洪水清晰可见，甚至就像笼罩他们，并将其与天堂隔离的乌云。在这乌云中的人，其状态是这样：他们绝无可能明白何为信之真理，更不可能明白何为信之良善。因为含有聪明和智慧在里面的天堂之光无法穿透这云层。这就是教会被毁后的状态。</p>

Scarcely anyone knows how the case is with the rejection of an old church and the adoption of a new church. He who does not know man's interiors and their states, and consequently man's states after 
death, cannot but infer that those who are of the old church, and in whom good and truth have been laid waste, that is, are no longer at heart acknowledged, are to perish, either as the antediluvians 
perished by the flood, or as did the Jews by expulsion from their land, or in some other way. But when the church has been laid waste, that is, when it is no longer in any good of faith, it perishes chiefly 
in respect to the states of its interiors, thus in respect to its states in the other life. Heaven then removes itself away from them-and consequently the Lord-and transfers itself to others, who 
are adopted in their stead; for without a church somewhere on the earth there is no communication of heaven with man; for the church is like the heart and lungs of the Grand Man on the earth (see n. 
468, 637, 931, 2054, 2853). [2] They who are then of the old church, and thus are removed from heaven, are in a kind of inundation as to their interiors, and in fact in an inundation over the head. 
This inundation the man himself does not observe while he lives in the body, but he comes into it after death. In the other life this inundation plainly appears like a thick cloud by which they are encompassed 
and separated from heaven. The state of those who are in this thick cloud is that they cannot possibly see what the truth of faith is, and still less what is its good; for the light of heaven, 
in which is intelligence and wisdom, cannot penetrate into this cloud. This is the state of a vastated church. </p>

<p align="center"><b>Elliott(1983-1999) 4423</b></p><p><b>4423.</b>
Scarcely anyone is aware of what actually happens when the old Church is set aside and the new adopted. One who has no knowledge of the interior aspects of man, or of the states in which these exist, 
and who therefore does not know about man's states after death, cannot do otherwise than take it to mean that those who belong to the old Church - among whom good and truth have been brought to ruin, 
that is, are no longer acknowledged in the heart - are going to perish either as those before the Flood did in the floodwaters, or as the Jews did by being expelled from their own land, or in some other 
way. But when the Church is brought to ruin, that is, when it ceases to keep at all to the good of faith, the interior aspects of the Church, and so the states in which it exists in the next life, 
perish. Heaven, and as a consequence the Lord, in that case departs from them and transfers itself to others who are adopted in place of them For without the Church somewhere on earth no communication 
of heaven with mankind exists, the Church being like the heart and lungs of the Grand Man on earth, <a href="468.htm">468</a>, <a href="637.htm">637</a>, <a href="931.htm">931</a>, <a href="2054.htm">2054</a>, <a href="2853.htm">2853</a>. </p>
<p></p>
<p><b>[2]</b>
 The interior aspects of those who belong at such a time to the old 
Church and so have been removed from heaven are subjected to a kind of deluge, a deluge in fact that rises above the head. Of this deluge no one has any awareness during his lifetime, but comes to 
know it after death. The deluge is clearly visible in the next life; indeed it is like a dark cloud which envelops people and separates them from heaven. The state of those within that dark cloud is such 
that they cannot possibly see what the truth of faith is, let alone what the good of faith is. For the light of heaven which holds intelligence and wisdom within it cannot penetrate that cloud. This 
is the state of the Church once it has been ruined. </p>

Quomodo se habet cum rejectione veteris Ecclesiae et adoptatione novae, vix aliquis novit; qui non (t)hominis interiora et horum {1} status, et inde hominis status post mortem, scit, non aliter capere 
potest quam quod illi qui ex vetere Ecclesia sunt, apud quos bonum et verum vastatum est, hoc est, non amplius corde agnoscitur, perituri (o)sint, vel sicut antediluviani diluvio, vel sicut Judaei 
expulsione (c)e terra sua, vel aliter: sed Ecclesia cum vastata est, hoc est, cum non amplius in aliquo bono fidei est, principaliter perit quoad status interiorum suorum, ita quoad status in 
altera vita; removet se tunc caelum ab illis, et consequenter Dominus, et se transfert ad alios qui loco illorum adoptantur; nam absque Ecclesia alicubi in tellure non datur communicatio caeli cum 
homine; Ecclesia enim est instar cordis et pulmonum Maximi Hominis in terra, {2} n. 468, 637, 931, 2054, 2853; </p>
<p>[2] qui tunc ab Ecclesia veteri sunt, et sic remoti a caelo, in quadam mundatione sunt 
quoad interiora, et quidem in mundatione supra caput; hanc mundationem ipse homo cum vivit in corpore, non appercipit, sed in illam venit post mortem; inundatio illa manifeste apparet in altera vita, 
et quidem instar nimbi nebulosi quo circumcinguntur, et per illum separantur a caelo: status illorum (o)qui in nimbo illo nebuloso, est quod ne quicquam possint videre quid verum fidei, et minus 
quid bonum ejus; lux enim caeli, in qua (o)est intelligentia et sapientia, in illum nimbum penetrare non potest: hic est status Ecclesiae vastatae.      @1 eorum$      @2 i videatur$ </p>
