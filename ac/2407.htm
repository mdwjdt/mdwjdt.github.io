<h3 align="center" class="ired">属天的奥秘 第2407节</h3>
<h4 align="center"></h4><p><strong>2407.</strong>“说，起来！带着你的妻子和你在这里找到的两个女儿出去”表信之真理和对真理与良善的情感；“找到”表已脱离邪恶。这从“起来”、“妻子”和“两个女儿”的含义清楚可知：“起来”是指从恶中升起（<a href="2401.htm">2401</a>节）；“妻子”是指信之真理，对此，可参看26节经文，那里论到罗得的妻子时说，她变成了一根盐柱；“两个女儿”是指对真与善的情感（参看<a href="2362.htm">2362</a>节）。“找到”表已脱离邪恶，这也是显而易见的，因为他们获得了自由。这几句话描述了教会的第二个状态，也就是说，他们不让自己象以前那样通过良善被引向真理，而是通过真理被引向良善；然而他们对良善仍有模糊的情感。因为真理越成为首领，良善就越模糊；相反，良善越成为首领，真理就越在自己的光中变得可见和清晰。</p>

<p align="center"><b>Potts(1905-1910) 2407</b></p><p><b>2407.</b>
Saying, Arise, take thy wife, and thy two daughters that are found. That this signifies the truth of faith and the affections of truth and of good, and that "found" means separated [from evil] is evident 
from the signification of "arising," as being to be elevated from evil (n. 2401); also from the signification in this place of "wife," as being the truth of faith (respecting which see under verse 
26, where it is said of Lot's wife that she was turned into a statue of salt) and also from the signification of the "two daughters," as being the affections of truth and of good (see n. 2362). That 
"found" denotes separated from evil, is also evident, because they were set free. By these few words is this second state of the church here described, namely, that they do not from good suffer themselves 
to be led to truth, as before, but through truth to good; and yet they are in an obscure affection of good; for in the proportion that truth is made the leader, good is obscure; whereas in the proportion 
that good is made the leader, truth is plain and evident in its own light. </p>

<p align="center"><b>Elliott(1983-1999) 2407</b></p><p><b>2407.</b>
'Saying, Rise up, take your wife and two daughters found [here]' means the truth of faith, and the affections for truth and for good, 'found' meaning that these had been separated from evil. This is 
clear from the meaning of 'rising up' as being raised up from evil, <a href="2401.htm">2401</a>, also from the meaning of 'wife' here as the truth of faith, dealt with at verse 26 which refers to Lot's wife being turned into 
a pillar of salt, as well as from the meaning of 'two daughters' as the affections for truth and for good, dealt with in <a href="2362.htm">2362</a>. That 'found' means having been separated from evil becomes clear too, in 
that they were set free. These few words describe this second state of the Church, which is that members did not allow themselves to be guided from good towards truth, as previously, but to be guided 
by way of truth towards good, though they still had an obscure affection for good. For to the extent that truth becomes the leader good becomes obscured; but to the extent that good becomes the leader 
truth is visible in its own light. </p>

<p align="center"><b>Latin(1748-1756) 2407</b>
</p><b>2407.</b>
Dicendo, Surge, accipe uxorem tuam, et duas filias inventas': quod significet verum fidei, et affectiones veri et boni, et quod `inventae' sint separatae [a malo], constat a significatione `surgere' 
quod sit elevari a malo, n. 2401; tum a significatione `uxoris' hic, quod sit verum fidei, de qua ad vers. 26, ubi agitur de uxore Loti quod versa in statuam salis; ut et {1} a significatione `duarum 
filiarum' quod sint affectiones veri et boni, de qua n. 2362: quod `inventae' sint separatae a malo, etiam constare potest, quia vindicatae. His paucis secundus hic status Ecclesiae describitur, quod 
nempe non ex bono se duci patiantur ad verum ut prius, sed per verum ad bonum, sed usque quod sint in affectione obscura boni; nam quantum verum fit dux, tantum obscurescit bonum; et {2} quantum bonum 
fit dux, tantum in luce sua patet verum. 	@1 tum.$ 	@2 at.$ </p>
