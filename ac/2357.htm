<h3 align="center" class="ired">属天的奥秘 第2357节</h3>
<h4 align="center"></h4><p><strong>2357.</strong>“把身后的门关上”表唯恐他们对仁之善施暴，以及拒绝接受主的神圣人性和神圣活动。这从目前所述清楚可知。在这种情况下，“关门”表示唯恐他们进入“房子”所表示的良善，因而触及主的神圣人性和祂的神圣活动。<br />这些话包含更深层的奥秘，当阅读它们时，其含义和概念就会进入天使的脑海。这些深层奥秘是：过着邪恶生活的人不可再向前走，仅止于知道良善和主，他们不可进入真正的承认和信本身。原因在于，他们只要处于邪恶，就无法同时处于良善。没人能同时侍奉两个主。人一旦承认并相信，然后又恢复邪恶的生活，就会亵渎良善与圣物。他若不承认和相信，则无法亵渎。因此，主的天命小心看顾每个人，免得他得以继续发自内心承认并拥有信本身，除非他之后被保守在那承认和信中。这是因为对亵渎的惩罚在地狱中是最严厉的。<br />这就是为何如今很少有人被允许发自内心相信，从爱与仁所流出的良善就是人里面的天堂，并且一切神性都在主里面的原因，因为如今人们过着邪恶的生活。这就是罗得把身后的门关上所表示的更深层的含义，因为这“门”是一扇内门，通过它可进入天使所在的房子本身，也就是有主在里面的良善。</p>

And shut the door behind him. That this signifies lest they should do violence to the good of charity and should also deny the Lord's Divine Human and Holy proceeding, is evident from what has been already 
said. In the present case to "shut the door" denotes lest they should enter into the good signified by the "house," and therefore to the Lord's Divine and Holy.  [2] These things involve still 
deeper arcana, into the sense and idea of which the angels come when these words are being read, namely, that they who are in a life of evil are admitted no further than to the knowledge of good and 
of the Lord, but not into the veriest acknowledgment and faith; for the reason that so long as they are in evil they cannot be at the same time in good. No one can at the same time serve two masters. 
When a man who once acknowledges and believes returns to a life of evil, he profanes what is good and holy; but he who does not acknowledge and believe, cannot profane. Care is therefore taken by the 
Lord's Divine Providence lest a man be admitted further into the very acknowledgment and faith of the heart than he can afterwards be kept; and this on account of the punishment of profanation, which 
is the most grievous in hell. [3] This is the reason why at the present day it is vouchsafed to so few, to believe from the heart that the good of love and charity are heaven in man, and that all the 
Divine is in the Lord; for at the present day men are in a life of evil. This then is what is more interiorly signified by Lot's shutting the door behind him; for this door was an inner door, through 
which there was admission into the house itself where the angels were; that is, into the good in which is the Lord. </p>

<p align="center"><b>Elliott(1983-1999) 2357</b></p><p><b>2357.</b>
'And shut the door behind him' means to prevent them doing violence to good that flows from charity and denying the Lord's Divine Human and His Holy proceeding. This is clear from what has been stated 
so far. 'Shutting the door' is preventing their entrance, in this case into good meant by 'the house', and so reaching the Lord's Divine Human and His Holy [proceeding]. </p>
<p></p>
<p><b>[2]</b>
 These words embody even 
deeper arcana, the meaning and conception of which angels enter into when these words are read. The deeper arcana are these: People who lead lives of evil are not allowed to go beyond the point of 
mere knowledge of good and of the Lord. They are not allowed to go on to genuine acknowledgement and faith itself, the reason being that as long as they are governed by evil they cannot at the same time 
be governed by good. Nobody can serve two masters simultaneously. Once a person acknowledges and believes, he profanes that which is good and holy if he goes back to a life of evil. But a person who 
does not acknowledge and believe is not able to profane. The Lord's Providence therefore guards against anyone being allowed to go on to acknowledge and have faith itself in the heart, except insofar 
as he can then be maintained in that acknowledgement and faith. And He does so on account of the punishment that goes with profanation, which in hell is most severe. </p>
<p></p>
<p><b>[3]</b>
 This is the reason why at 
the present day so few people are allowed to believe from the heart that the good which flows from love and charity is heaven itself within man, and that the whole of the Divine is within the Lord, for 
they lead lives of evil. This then is the more interior meaning of the statement 'to shut the door behind him', for 'the door' (ostium) was an inner door leading into the house itself where the angels 
were, that is, into good which has the Lord within it. </p>

`Et ostium clausit post se': quod significet ne violarent bonum charitatis, et negarent Divinum Humanum et Sanctum procedens Domini, constat ab illis quae nunc dicta sunt; `claudere ostium {1}' est 
ne intrent, hic ne in bonum significatum per `domum,' ac ita ad Divinum et Sanctum Domini.  [2] Involvunt haec etiam arcaniora, in quorum sensum et ideam veniunt angeli cum haec leguntur, nempe quod illi 
qui in vita mali sunt, non ulterius admittantur quam ad cognitionem boni et Domini, non autem usque ad ipsissimam agnitionem et fidem; ex causa quia, quamdiu in malo sunt, non simul in bono esse possint; 
servire simul duobus dominis nemo potest; qui semel agnoscit et credit, si redit ad vitam mali, profanat bonum, et sanctum, qui autem non agnoscit et credit, is nec profanare potest; ideo ex Providentia 
Domini cavetur, ut {2} homo admittatur ulterius in ipsam agnitionem et fidem cordis quam quantum dein teneri in illa potest; et hoc ob causam poenae profanationis, quae in inferno gravissima 
est; [3] (m)haec causa est quod tam paucis hodie concedatur ex corde credere quod bonum amoris et charitatis sit caelum in homine, et quod omne Divinum sit in Domino, in vita enim mali sunt:' hoc nunc 
est quod interius significatur per quod `Lot clausit ostium post se'; ostium enim erat interior janua per quam in ipsam domum ubi angeli, intrabatur, hoc est, in bonum in quo Dominus. 	@1 i ad domum.$ 	@2 
A d ne i ut, I has ut which T changes unnecessarily to ne; cavetur is used in the sense of `guard against.'$ </p>
