<h3 align="center" class="ired">属天的奥秘 第5741节</h3>
<h4 align="center"></h4><p><strong>5741.</strong>“那些人，他们和他们的驴，就被打发走了”表外在属世人，连同它的真理和记忆知识，在某种程度上被移除。这从雅各的十个儿子、<br />“驴”和“被打发走，走了不远”的含义清楚可知：雅各的十个儿子，即此处的“那些人”，是指存在于属世层中的教会之真理（参看<a href="5403.htm">5403</a>，<a href="5419.htm">5419</a>，<a href="5427.htm">5427</a>，<a href="5458.htm">5458</a>，<a href="5512.htm">5512</a>节），因而是指外在属世人（<a href="5680.htm">5680</a>节）；“驴”是指记忆知识（<a href="5492.htm">5492</a>节）；“被打发走，走了不远”是指它，即外在属世人在某种程度上被移除。由此明显可知，“那些人，他们和他们的驴，就被打发走了，走了不远”表示外在属世人，连同它的真理和记忆知识在某种程度上被移除，即从“约瑟”所代表的内在属天人那里被移除。<br />至于“驴”的含义，要知道，它们用来骑时表示一回事，用来驮物时表示另一回事；因为审判官、君王和他们的儿子骑在公驴、母驴，以及骡子上。在这种时候，“驴”表示理性真理与良善，以及属世真理与良善（<a href="2781.htm">2781</a>节）。这解释了为何当主作为审判官和君王进入耶路撒冷时，祂骑在母驴和驴驹上；这是祂的审判和王权的标志。但是，当驴子用来驮物时，如此处的情形，它们表示记忆知识。记忆知识就像负重的牲畜。人在思想构成人之内层的事物时，若只看到人的记忆知识所包含的记忆知识，就会以为人的一切在于这些知识；殊不知记忆知识是人里面最低级的事物，或说是构成人格的最低层，并且具有这样的性质：当肉体死亡时，它们大部分被收起来，隐藏不见（<a href="2475.htm">2475</a>-<a href="2480.htm">2480</a>节）。不过，包含在它们里面的东西，即真理与良善，连同对它们的情感，会保留下来；对恶人来说，保留下来的是虚假与邪恶，连同对它们的情感。记忆知识可以说是这些事物的身体。只要人活在世上，他的记忆知识里面要么是真理与良善，要么是虚假与邪恶，因为这些记忆知识是盛纳它们的容器。记忆知识因盛纳、因而可以说携带内层事物，故由驮物的驴子来表示。</p>

<p align="center"><b>Potts(1905-1910) 5741</b></p><p><b>5741.</b>
And the men were sent away, they and their asses. That this signifies that the external natural man was removed somewhat with its truths and memory-knowledges, is evident from the representation of Jacob's 
sons, who are here the "men," as being the truths of the church in the natural (see n. 5403, 5419, 5427, 5458, 5512), and therefore the external natural man (n. 5680); from the signification of 
"asses," as being memory-knowledges (n. 5492); and from the signification of "sent away, and not far off," as being that it-the external natural man-was removed somewhat. From this it is plain that by 
"the men were sent away, they and their asses, not far off," is signified the external natural man, removed somewhat with its truths and memory-knowledges, namely, from the internal celestial which 
is represented by Joseph. [2] As regards the signification of "asses," be it known that they signified one thing when they were used for riding, and another when they served for carrying burdens; for 
judges, kings, and their sons rode upon he-asses, she-asses, and also upon mules, and these then signified rational, and also natural, truth and good (n. 2781); for which reason when the Lord as Judge 
and King entered Jerusalem, He rode upon an ass with a colt; for this was the mark of judgeship, and also of royalty. But when asses served for carrying burdens, as here, then they signified memory-knowledges. 
Nor is the case different with these knowledges. One who in thinking of man's interior things advances no further than to the knowledges that are of the memory, supposes that everything of 
man consists in these knowledges, not being aware that memory-knowledges are the lowest things in man, and such as for the most part are put away when the body dies (n. 2475-2480); but the things that 
are in them, namely truth and good together with their affections, remain; and also with the evil there remain falsity and evil together with their affections; memory-knowledges being as it were the 
body of these. So long as a man lives in the world, he has truth and good, or falsity and evil, in the memory-knowledges, for these are what contain them; and because memory-knowledges contain, and therefore 
as it were carry, interior things, they are signified by the asses which serve for carrying burdens. </p>

<p align="center"><b>Elliott(1983-1999) 5741</b></p><p><b>5741.</b>
'And the men were sent away, they and their asses' means the external natural man was to some extent removed, together with its truths and factual knowledge. This is clear from the representation of 
Jacob's ten sons, to whom 'the men' refers here, as truths known to the Church which are present in the natural, dealt with in <a href="5403.htm">5403</a>, <a href="5419.htm">5419</a>, <a href="5427.htm">5427</a>, <a href="5458.htm">5458</a>, <a href="5512.htm">5512</a>, and therefore the external natural man, <a href="5680.htm">5680</a>; 
from the meaning of 'asses' as factual knowledge, dealt with in <a href="5492.htm">5492</a>; and from the meaning of 'sent away and 'not far distant' as the fact that it - the external natural man - was to some extent removed. 
From all this it is evident that 'the men were sent away, they and their asses, not far distant' means that the external man was to some extent removed, together with its truths and factual knowledge 
- removed from the internal celestial, which is represented by 'Joseph'. </p>
<p></p>
<p><b>[2]</b>
 As to the meaning of 'asses', it should be realized that something different is meant by them when they served as 
animals that were ridden on; for judges, kings, and their sons used to ride on asses, she-asses, and also mules. At such times 'asses' were a sign of rational truth and good, and also of natural truth 
and good, see <a href="2781.htm">2781</a>. This explains why, when as judge and king the Lord entered Jerusalem, He rode on a she-ass with her colt, this being a sign indicating His offices of judge and king. But 'asses' 
had another meaning when they served as beasts of burden, as they did here. In this case they were a sign of factual knowledge. Factual knowledge is just like such a beast of burden. Anyone who, when 
he thinks about what constitutes a person interiorly, looks no further than factual knowledge contained in a person's memory, presumes that there is no more to a human being than such knowledge. He does 
not know that factual knowledge constitutes the lowest level of the human personality and is such that most of it becomes hidden from view when the body dies, <a href="2475.htm">2475</a>-<a href="2477.htm">2477</a>, <a href="2479.htm">2479</a>, <a href="2480.htm">2480</a>. But What the knowledge 
contains within itself remains, namely truth and goodness, together with affections for them, or in the case of evil people, falsity and evil, together with affections for these. Factual knowledge 
is so to speak the body for those things. As long as a person is living in the world, these things - truth and goodness, or else falsity and evil- are held within his factual knowledge since it is 
their container. And because factual knowledge contains and thus so to speak carries interior things with it, that is therefore meant by asses that serve to carry burdens. </p>

`Et viri dimissi sunt, illi et asini illorum':  quod significet quod externus naturalis homo aliquantum remotus cum suis veris et scientificis, constat ex repraesentatione ` {1} filiorum Jacobi' qui 
hic sunt `viri', quod sint vera Ecclesiae in naturali, de qua n. 5403, 5419, 5427, 5458, 5512; {2}proinde quod sint externus naturalis homo, ii. 5680; ex significatione `asinorum' quod sint scientifica, 
de qua n. 5492; et ex significatione `dimissi' et {3} `non elongati' quod sit aliquantum remotus, nempe externus naturalis homo; inde patet quod per `viri dimissi sunt, illi et asini illorum, non 
elongati' significetur externus naturalis homo aliquantum remotus cum suis veris et scientificis, nempe a caelesti interno quod repraesentatur per `Josephum'. [2] Quod significationem `asinorum' attinet, 
sciendum quod  aliud significent cum inserviverant equitando, nam super asinis, {4}asinabus, ut et mulis, equitabant judices, reges et eorum filii, et tunc significaverunt verum et bonum rationale 
et quoque naturale, videatur n. 2781; inde erat quod Dominus ut judex et ut rex, cum Hierosolymam intravit, equitabat super asina cum pullo; hoc enim fuit insigne judiciale et insigne regium; verum `asini' 
aliud significabant cum inserviverunt (x)oneri portando, ut hic, tunc significabant scientifica; scientifica nec aliter se habent; qui {5}non ultra cogitatione vadit, quoad illa quae sunt interiora 
hominis, quam ad scientifica quae sunt memoriae, putat quod omne hominis in illis consistat; non scit quod scientifica sint infima apud hominem, et talia quae ad plurimam partem reconduntur cum corpus 
moritur, n. 2475-2477, 2479, 2480; sed quae in illis sunt, nempe verum et bonum, cum illorum affectionibus, manent; et quoque {6}apud malos falsum et malum cum illorum affectionibus; scientifica 
{7} sunt illorum quasi corpus; quamdiu homo in mundo vivit, tunc illa, nempe verum et bonum, aut falsum et malum, {8}habet in scientificis, nam haec sunt continentia; et quia scientifica continent et 
sic quasi portant interiora, ideo illa significantur per `asinos qui inserviunt oneri portando'. @1 i decem$ @2 et quod inde$ @3 i mox$ @4 i et$ @5 cogitatione ad interiore hominis non ultra vadit$ @6
