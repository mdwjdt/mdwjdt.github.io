<h4 align="center"></h4><p><strong>478.</strong>他之所以被称为“亚当”，是因为希伯来语的“亚当”表示“人”。但事实上，“亚当”从没被用作人名，而是指“人”，这一点可从本节和之前的经文明显可知，因为论到他时用的是复数而非单数，也可从这个词既指男人又指女人明显可知，二者一起被称为“人”。谁都能从包含这二者的话中看出这一点，因为经上说：在他们被造的日子，祂称其名为“人”（Ｍan）。同样在第一章中说：让我们照着我们的形像造人，使他们管理海里的鱼（创世记<a href="http://39-27.cn/创1.27.htm">1:27</a>-<a href="http://39-27.cn/创1.28.htm">28</a>）。由此可知，所论述的主题并非作为第一个人类的某一个人的创造，而是上古教会的创造。</p>

<p><strong>[NCE]478.</strong> The reason the term adam is used is that the Hebrew word means a human. The person is never called by the proper name Adam but is called the human. Clear evidence for this is the fact that here [in verse <a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_478/bible_king-james-version_genesis_5_2" target=_top>2</a>] and earlier the human is spoken of not in the singular but in the plural. What is more, the term refers to both the man and the woman; both together are called the human. Anyone can see that this is so from the words themselves, which are, "He called their name Human Being on the day on which they were created" [<a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_478/bible_king-james-version_genesis_5_2" target=_top>Genesis 5:2</a>]. Likewise in chapter <a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_478/bible_king-james-version_genesis_1_1-31" target=_top>1</a> it says, "Let us make a human in our image, and these will rule over the fish of the sea" (<a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_478/bible_king-james-version_genesis_1_26-27" target=_top>Genesis 1:26-27</a>, <a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_478/bible_king-james-version_genesis_1_28" target=_top>28</a>). The same words also show that the subject is not some first-created individual of the race but the whole of the earliest church. </p>

The reason why he is called "Adam" is that the Hebrew word "Adam" signifies "man;" but that he is never properly called "Adam" by name, but "Man" is very evident from this passage and also from former 
ones, in that [in some cases] he is not spoken of in the singular number, but in the plural, and also from the fact that the term is predicated of both the man and the woman, both together being called 
"Man." That it is predicated of both, everyone may see from the words, for it is said, "He called their name Man, in the day that they were created;" and in like manner in the first chapter: "Let 
us make man in our image, and let them have dominion over the fish of the sea" (Gen. 1:27-28). Hence also it may appear that the subject treated of is not the creation of some one man who was the first 
of mankind, but the Most ancient Church. </p>

<p align="center"><b>Elliott(1983-1999) 478</b></p><p><b>478.</b>
The reason he is called Adam is that the Hebrew word Adam means man. But the fact that Adam was never used as a proper name, only Man, is quite clear from the consideration that both here and earlier 
he is spoken of in the plural and not in the singular, and that the term refers to both man and woman. The two together are called Man. Anyone from these words that both are included, for it is said, 
'He called their name Man on the day in which they were created', and similarly in 1:26, <a href="28.htm">28</a>, 'Let Us make man in Our image, and they will have dominion over the fish of the sea. This shows also that 
the subject is not about someone who, when created, was the first human being of all, but about the Most Ancient Church.  </p>

<p align="center"><b>Latin(1748-1756) 478</b>
</p><b>478.</b>
Quod Adam dicatur, causa est quia vox Hebraea Adam significat hominem; at quod nusquam nomine proprie Adam dictus sed Homo, constat manifeste hic et prius, quod non in singulari sed in plurali dicatur, 
aut quod de utroque praedicetur tam de viro quam de femina, uterque simul dicitur Homo; quod de utroque, quisque potest ex verbis videre, nam dicitur, 'Vocavit nomen illorum Homo, in die quo creati 
sunt,' similiter cap. i, 'Faciamus hominem in imaginem nostram,... et dominabuntur in pisces maris,' [vers.] {x} 26, 28; inde quoque constare potest quod non de omnium primo aliquo homine creato, sed 
de Antiquissima Ecclesia, agatur. </p>
