<h3 align="center" class="ired">属天的奥秘 第1866节</h3>
<h4 align="center"></h4><p><strong>1866.</strong>“从埃及河直到大河，幼发拉底河”表属灵和属天事物的延伸，“埃及河”是指属灵事物的延伸，“幼发拉底河”是指属天事物的延伸。这从“埃及河”和“大河，幼发拉底河”的含义清楚可知。这些河表示属灵和属天事物的延伸，这从迦南地的含义明显看出来。迦南地是指主在天上和地上的国度，其中只有信的属灵事物和相爱的属天事物。所以，迦南地的边界无非表示这些事物的延伸。因为天上的人根本不知道何为迦南地，何为埃及河、大河幼发拉底河，甚至不知道地的边界是什么。但他们却十分清楚何为属灵和属天事物的延伸，以及这些事物状态的范围和限度。当人阅读字面上的事物时，天上的人心里所想的就是这些事物，以致充当天堂观念基础的文字及其历史意义都消失不见了。<br />“埃及河”之所以表示属灵事物的延伸，是因为“埃及”表记忆知识（或事实知识），这知识连同人的理性概念和智性概念一起构成属灵事物，如前所述（<a href="1443.htm">1443</a>节等）。至于“埃及”的内义为何表记忆知识或事实知识，可参看前文（<a href="1164.htm">1164</a>，<a href="1165.htm">1165</a>，<a href="1186.htm">1186</a>，<a href="1462.htm">1462</a>节）。“幼发拉底河”表属天事物的延伸，这从这条河从迦南地分界出来的陆地清楚可知，这些陆地在很多其它经文中同样表属天事物的知识和认知。然而，由于它在此被称为“河”和“大河”，故它们唯独表示属天事物和对它们的认知，因为“大河”和“大”用来论及这些事物。</p>

<p><strong>[NCE]1866.</strong> From the river of Egypt to the great river, the river Phrath, symbolizes the extent of spiritual and heavenly qualities; to the river of Egypt is the extent of spiritual qualities; to the river Phrath is the extent of heavenly qualities. This can be seen from the symbolism of the river of Egypt and that of the great river, or the river Euphrates.<br />The symbolism of these rivers as the extent of spiritual and heavenly qualities can be seen from the symbolism of the land of Canaan as the Lord's kingdom in the heavens and on earth. That kingdom contains nothing but the spiritual qualities of faith and the heavenly qualities of mutual love. As a consequence, the boundaries of Canaan can only mean the extent of these qualities. The inhabitants of heaven have no notion at all of what the land of Canaan is, what the river of Egypt is, what the great river Euphrates is, or in fact what the boundaries of any land are. They do know how far spiritual and heavenly qualities reach, and they know in what direction spiritual and heavenly states lie and where they end. These are the subjects they have their minds on when people on earth read about such things. In this way the letter of the Word and its narrative content vanish, once they have served as a focal point for the heavenly thoughts of heaven's inhabitants.<br />[2] The reason the river of Egypt symbolizes the extent of spiritual qualities is that Egypt symbolizes facts. Facts, together with people's rational processes and moments of deep understanding, are spiritual entities, as noted before in <a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_1866/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_1443" target=_top>1443</a> and many other places. The symbolism of Egypt on an inner level as facts is mentioned in <a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_1866/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_1164" target=_top>1164</a>, <a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_1866/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_1165" target=_top>1165</a>, <a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_1866/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_1186" target=_top>1186</a>, <a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_1866/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_1462" target=_top>1462</a>.<br />The symbolism of the river Euphrates as the extent of heavenly qualities can be seen from the lands which that river borders and which it separates from Canaan. These lands too symbolize facts and the knowledge of heavenly matters, in various passages.{*1} Here, though, since it is being called a river, and a great river at that, it symbolizes only heavenly matters and the knowledge of them, because a great river and size in general have to do with heavenly things.<br /><br /><strong>Footnotes:</strong><br />{*1} The lands on the far side of the Euphrates from Canaan could be variously listed, but Assyria would figure prominently in any account. Its positive meaning is the rational mind or reasoning from facts. Passages in which Swedenborg demonstrates this meaning by reference to particular Bible passages are too numerous to list; as examples, see <a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_1866/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_119" target=_top>119</a>, <a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_1866/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_1186" target=_top>1186</a>. Aram, or Syria, is described as being on the far side of the Euphrates in <a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_1866/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_4112" target=_top>4112</a>. This region is in many passages said to symbolize the knowledge of truth and goodness; for such a statement with biblical references, see <a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_1866/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_1232" target=_top>1232</a>. Babylonia and Chaldea, though they were east of the Euphrates, seem not to be included among the lands Swedenborg intends here. A positive meaning is obviously required, and in Swedenborg's exegesis Babylonia and Chaldea overwhelmingly symbolize various negative forces; for example, false worship or profanation (<a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_1866/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_1368" target=_top>1368</a>) and self-love and love of worldly advantages (<a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_1866/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_1691#subsection-2-4" target=_top>1691:4</a>). For a passage similar to this, see <a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_1866/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_9340#subsection-2-2" target=_top>9340:2</a>.

From the river of Egypt unto the great river, the river Euphrates. That this signifies the extension of spiritual and celestial things-to "the river of Egypt" being the extension of spiritual things, 
and "to the river Euphrates" being the extension of celestial things-is evident from the signification of "the river of Egypt," and from the signification of "the great river," or "the Euphrates." That 
these "rivers" signify the extension of spiritual and celestial things, may be seen from the signification of the land of Canaan, as being the Lord's kingdom in the heavens and on the earth, in which 
there is nothing but the spiritual things which are of faith and the celestial things which are of mutual love; and therefore nothing but the extension of these can be meant by the boundaries of the 
land of Canaan. For what the land of Canaan is, what the river of Egypt is, and what the great river Euphrates is, and indeed what the boundaries of any land are, they who are in the heavens do not 
know at all; but they well know what the extension of spiritual and celestial things is, and also the determinations and the limitations of the states of these things. These things they have in mind while 
the others are being read by man; and so the letter vanishes and together with it that historical sense which has served as an objective form for the heavenly ideas.  [2] That "the river of Egypt" 
signifies the extension of spiritual things, is because "Egypt" signifies memory-knowledges [scientifica], which, together with a man's rational and intellectual things, constitute spiritual things 
(as before said, n. 1443 and in other places; and that "Egypt" in the internal sense signifies memory-knowledges may be seen n. 1164, 1165, 1186, 1462). That "the river Euphrates" signifies the extension 
of celestial things, may be seen from a consideration of the lands which that river bounds and separates from the land of Canaan, and by which likewise in many passages are signified the knowledges 
[scientifica et cognitiones] of celestial things but here, because it is called "the river" and "the great river," celestial things and the knowledges [cognitiones] of them are what alone are signified; 
for a "great river" and "greatness" are predicated of these. </p>

'From the river of Egypt to the great river, the river Phrath' means the extension of spiritual and celestial things, 'to the river of Egypt' being the extension of spiritual things, 'to the river Phrath' 
the extension of celestial things. This is clear from the meaning of 'the river of Egypt' and from the meaning of 'the great river' or the Euphrates. That these rivers mean the extension of spiritual 
and celestial things becomes clear from the meaning of 'the land of Canaan' as the Lord's kingdom in heaven and on earth, in which kingdom there is nothing else than the spiritual things of faith 
and the celestial things of mutual love. Consequently nothing else can be meant by the borders of the land of Canaan than the extension of those things. For what the land of Canaan is, what the river 
of Egypt is, and what the great river, the Euphrates, is, the inhabitants of heaven do not know at all. Indeed they do not know what the borders of any land are; but they do know what the extension 
of spiritual and celestial things is, and the range and limits of the states belonging to them. These are the things which those in heaven have in mind when such things in the letter are read by man, 
so that the letter and its historical sense which has served as a basis for heavenly ideas disappears. </p>
<p></p>
<p><b>[2]</b>
 The reason why 'the river of Egypt' means the extension of spiritual things is that 'Egypt' 
means factual knowledge which, together with the rational concepts and the intellectual concepts which a person has, constitute spiritual things, as stated already in <a href="1443.htm">1443</a> and elsewhere in this volume. 
And as to why in the internal sense 'Egypt' means factual knowledge, see <a href="1164.htm">1164</a>, <a href="1165.htm">1165</a>, <a href="1186.htm">1186</a>, <a href="1462.htm">1462</a>. That 'the river Euphrates' means the extension of celestial things becomes clear from the lands which 
that river bounded and marked off from the land of Canaan, and by which in many other places facts and the cognitions of celestial things are meant. Here however because it is called 'the river', and 
'the great river', they are nothing other than celestial things and the cognitions of them, for 'the great river' and greatness are used in reference to these. </p>

'A fluvio Aegypti ad fluvium magnum, fluvium Phrath quod significet extensionem spiritualium et caelestium, 'ad fluvium Aegypti' quod sit extensio spiritualium, 'ad fluvium Phrath' quod sit extensio 
caelestium, constat a significatione 'fluvii Aegypti' et significatione 'fluvii magni seu Euphratis': quod hi fluvii significent extensionem spiritualium et caelestium, constare potest a significatione 
'terrae Canaanis' quod sit regnum Domini in caelis et in terris, quo non nisi quam spiritualia quae fidei, et caelestia quae amoris mutui, sunt; quare non aliud quam horum extensio per termini terrae 
Canaanis intelligi potest; nam quid terra Canaan, quid fluvius Aegypti, et quid fluvius magnus Euphrates, sint, prorsus nesciunt qui in caelis, immo quid termini alicujus terrae; sed quid extensio 
spiritualium et caelestium, et statuum illorum determinationes et terminationes, norunt; in his mentem habent, cum illa ab homine leguntur, evanescente sic littera, et ejus sensu historico, qui inserviit 
pro objecto ideis caelestibus.  Quod 'fluvius Aegypti' significet extensionem spiritualium, inde est quia 'Aegyptus' significat scientifica quae una cum rationalibus et intellectualibus hominis sunt 
spiritualia ut dictum prius n. 1443 et passim alibi; et quod 'Aegyptus' in sensu interno significet scientifica, n. 1164, 1165, 1186, 1462: quod 'fluvius Euphrates' significet extensionem caelestium, 
constare potest a terris quas fluvius iste terminat et disterminat a terra Canaane, per quas passim quoque scientifica et cognitiones caelestium significantur, hic vero quia appellatur fluvius, et 
fluvius magnus, non alia sunt quam caelestia et eorum cognitiones, nam 'magnus fluvius' 'magnitudo' de illis praedicatur. </p>
