<h3 align="center" class="ired">属天的奥秘 第5531节</h3>
<h4 align="center"></h4><p><strong>5531.</strong>“都在自己的口袋里”表在各人的容器里。这从“口袋”的含义清楚可知，“口袋”是指一个容器（参看<a href="5489.htm">5489</a>，<a href="5494.htm">5494</a>，<a href="5529.htm">5529</a>节）。有必要在此简要阐述一下何谓容器。人的属世层被分成各个容器。每个容器都构成一个总的整体；不怎么总体或相对具体的部分以井然有序的群组而在这个总的整体里面；细节部分则在这些具体部分里面。每一个总的整体，连同它的具体和细节部分，都包含自己的容器在里面；它能在这容器中运作，或改变自己的形式，使自己的状态发生变化。对已重生的人来说，这些容器的数目和他里面的总体真理一样多，每个容器都对应于天上的某个社群。这种有序状态就存在于处于爱之良善，并因此处于信之真理的人身上。当各人的容器论及雅各的十个儿子所代表的属世层中的总体真理时，由此可对何谓各人的容器形成某种概念。</p>

Was in his sack. That this signifies in the receptacle of each, is evident from the signification of a "sack," as being a receptacle (see n. 5489, 5494, 5529). What is here meant by a receptacle may 
be briefly told. Man's natural is divided into receptacles; and in each receptacle is some general thing, in which things less general or relatively particular are set in order, and in these single things. 
Each such general thing, together with its particulars and singulars, has its own receptacle, within which it can operate, or vary its forms and change its states. With the man who has been regenerated 
these receptacles are as many in number as there are general truths in him, and each receptacle corresponds to some society in heaven. Such is the setting in order with the man who is in the good 
of love and thence in the truth of faith. From this it will to some extent be plain what is meant by the receptacle of each, when predicated of the general truths in the natural, represented by the 
ten sons of Jacob. </p>

'Was in his sack' means in each one's receptacle. This is clear from the meaning of 'a sack' as a receptacle, dealt with in <a href="5489.htm">5489</a>, <a href="5494.htm">5494</a>, <a href="5529.htm">5529</a>. What is meant by a receptacle here must also be stated briefly. 
A person's natural is divided into receptacles. Each receptacle comprises a general whole within which there are, in ordered groups, less general or relatively particular parts, and specific parts 
within these. Each general whole, together with its particular and its specific parts, includes within itself its own receptacle which can activate itself, that is, can achieve variations in form 
and effect changes of state within itself. The receptacles present with a person who has been regenerated are as many in number as the general truths present with him, and each receptacle corresponds 
to some community in heaven. This ordered condition exists with the person in whom the good of love and consequently the truth of faith are present. From all this one may gain some idea of what is meant 
by each one's receptacle when this phrase is used to refer to general truths in the natural which are represented by 'the ten sons of Jacob'. </p>

`In sacco suo': quod significet in cujusvis receptaculo, constat ex significatione `sacci' quod sit receptaculum, de qua n. 5489, 5494, 5529.  Quid hic receptaculum, etiam paucis dicendum: naturale 
 hominis in receptacula est distinctum; in unoquovis receptaculo est commune quoddam, in quo communi minus communia seu  particularia respective, et in his singularia, ordinata sunt; unumquodvis tale 
commune cum particularibus suis et cum singularibus habet suum receptaculum intra quod se actuare, seu formas variare et status mutare, possit; receptacula illa apud hominem qui regeneratus est, sunt 
totidem numero quot vera communia apud illum, et unumquodvis receptaculum correspondet societati cuidam in caelo; talis est ordinatio apud hominem qui in bono amoris et inde in vero fidei est; ex his 
aliquatenus patet quid intelligitur per cujusvis receptaculum, cum praedicatur de communibus veris in naturali quae repraesentantur per `decem filios Jacobi'. </p>
