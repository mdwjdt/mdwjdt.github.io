<h4 align="center"></h4><p><strong>1397.</strong>由于这些直觉如此敏锐，故恶灵无法靠近处于相爱的善灵所在之处，因为那里有他们的气场或社群。只要一靠近它，他们就开始感到痛苦，然后抱怨、哀号。有一个胆大妄为、刚愎自用的恶灵强行闯进天堂边缘的某个社群，但就在到达第一道门槛的那一刻，他几乎喘不过气来，并闻到自己身上死尸般的恶臭，因而仰面栽倒。</p><br />

<p><strong>[NCE]1397.</strong> Since their sensitivities are so acute, evil spirits cannot go near any environment or community inhabited by good spirits, who love each other. Let the good spirits just approach and the evil ones begin to suffer, complaining and crying.<br />A certain evil spirit was brash and bold enough to force his way into a community that lay at the very threshold of heaven. The instant he arrived, he found he could hardly breathe and sensed that he stank like a corpse, so he slipped back down. </p>
<p align="center"><b>Potts(1905-1910) 1397</b></p><p><b>1397.</b>
As the perceptions are so exquisite, evil spirits cannot approach a sphere, or any society, where there are good spirits who are in mutual love. When they merely approach it they begin to be distressed, 
and they complain and lament. In his audacity and self-confidence, a spirit who was evil obtruded himself into a certain society that is at the first threshold of heaven; but from the moment of his 
arrival he was scarcely able to breathe, and became sensible of a cadaverous stench from himself, and therefore fell back. </p>

<p align="center"><b>Elliott(1983-1999) 1397</b></p><p><b>1397.</b>
Since perceptions are so keen, evil spirits cannot go near a sphere or any community where there are good spirits in whom mutual love reigns. When they merely go near they start to feel pain, and to 
complain and wail as they do so. Out of boldness and self-confidence a certain spirit who was evil pushed his way into a certain community on the outskirts of heaven. But as soon as he got near he could 
scarcely breathe. He smelt his own corpse-like stench, and as a consequence fell back. </p>

<p align="center"><b>Latin(1748-1756) 1397</b>
</p><b>1397.</b>
Quia perceptiones tam exquisitae sunt, mali spiritus non approximare possunt ad sphaeram aut aliquam societatem ubi spiritus boni, qui in amore mutuo; cum modo approximant, incipiunt angi, querentes 
et lamentantes.  Quidam ex audacia et sui fiducia, qui malus, ingessit se in aliquam societatem quae in primo limine caeli, sed ilico cum alluit, vix respirare potuit, et sensit fetorem sui cadaverosum, 
quare relapsus. </p>
