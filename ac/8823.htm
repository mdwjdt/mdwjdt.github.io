<h3 align="center" class="ired">属天的奥秘 第8823节</h3>
<h4 align="center"></h4><p><strong>8823.</strong>“号角的响声越来越大”表经由天使天堂而来的启示的总体方面。这从“号角的响声”和“越来越大”的含义清楚可知。“号角的响声”是指与神性联结的属天真理或天使真理（参看<a href="8815.htm">8815</a>节），因而是指启示的总体方面，因为神之真理就是启示，通过天堂所揭示的东西，相对于天堂里的神之真理本身来说，是非常总体的；事实上，它在外面或周围（<a href="8815.htm">8815</a>节），在周围或外面的东西相对于在中间或里面的东西来说，是总体的。“越来越大”是指增多。此中情形就像声音，它在空气稀薄的高处是听不见或静默的；但随着下降到空气稠密的较低区域，声音变得越来越大，越来越响亮。神性真理和神性良善也是如此，它在最高层是平安的，完全没有任何骚动；但当它们下降到低层时，却逐渐变得不平安，最终变得极其动荡。这些事就是主在列王纪上向在何烈的以利亚所描述的：<br />你出来站在山上，在耶和华面前。看哪，耶和华从那里经过，在耶和华面前有大而强烈的风，使山崩裂；耶和华却不在风中；风后地震，耶和华却不在地震中；地震后有火，耶和华也不在火中；火后有微小的响声。（列王记上<a href="http://39-27.cn/王上19.11.htm">19:11</a>，<a href="http://39-27.cn/王上19.12.htm">12</a>）</p>

And when the voice of the trumpet was going, and waxing strong mightily. That this signifies what is general of revelation through the angelic heaven, is evident from the signification of "the voice 
of the trumpet," as being heavenly or angelic truth conjoined with what is Divine (see n. 8815), thus what is general of revelation; for truth Divine is revelation, and that which is manifested through 
the medium of heaven is general relatively to the truth Divine itself in heaven, for it is without or around (n. 8815), and what is around and without is general relatively to that which is in the midst, 
or which is within; and from the signification of "going and waxing strong," as being the increase thereof. For the case herein is as it is with sound which is on high, where the atmosphere is purer, 
and the sound is silent; but when it descends to lower regions where the atmosphere is denser, it becomes louder and more sonorous. So it is with Divine truth and Divine good, which in the highest 
are peaceful and cause no disturbance whatever; but when they descend toward lower things they gradually become unpeaceful, and finally tumultuous. This is what is so described by the Lord in the first 
book of the Kings to Elijah, when he was in Horeb: </p>
<p>     Go forth, and stand on the mountain before Jehovah; behold Jehovah is passing by; so that there was a great and strong wind rending the mountains, 
and breaking in pieces the rocks before Jehovah; Jehovah was not in the wind. Then after the wind an earthquake; yet Jehovah was not in the earthquake. After the earthquake a fire; Jehovah was 
not in the fire. Lastly after the fire a still small voice* (1 Kings 19:11, 12). * The Latin has "a still thin voice" (vox silentii tenuis). </p>

<p align="center"><b>Elliott(1983-1999) 8823</b></p><p><b>8823.</b>
'And the voice of the trumpet grew louder and louder' means revelation in its general aspects, which comes through the angelic heaven. This is clear from the meaning of 'the voice of a trumpet' as celestial 
or angelic truth joined to the Divine, dealt with in <a href="8815.htm">8815</a>, and so revelation in its general aspects, since God's truth is revelation, and what is revealed by means of heaven is very general compared 
with God's truth itself in heaven (for it is outside or round about, <a href="8815.htm">8815</a>, and what is round about or outside is general compared with what is in the middle or inside); and from the meaning of 
'growing louder and louder' as increasing, for just as a sound is inaudible on high, where the air is rarer, but grows and sounds louder as it comes down to lower levels, where the air is denser, so Divine 
Good and Divine Truth on highest levels are peaceful and altogether without any agitation; but as they pass down to lower levels they become by degrees less peaceful and at length violently agitated. 
These things are described in the following way by the Lord to Elijah when he was in Horeb, in the first Book of Kings, </p>
<p>Go out, and stand on the mountain before Jehovah. Behold, Jehovah was passing 
by, so that a great and strong wind was breaking apart the mountains, and shattering the rocks before Jehovah; Jehovah was not in the wind. Then after the wind, an earthquake; but Jehovah was not 
in the earthquake. After the earthquake, a fire; Jehovah was not in the fire. Finally after the fire, a slight whisper.<A name="fntext1"></a><A href="#fn1"><sup>a</sup></a> <a href="1.htm">1</a> Kings 19:11, <a href="12.htm">12</a>.

`Et fuit vox buccinae vadens et fortificans se valde': quod significet commune revelationis per caelum angelicum, constat ex significatione `vocis buccinae' quod sit verum caeleste seu angelicum Divino 
conjunctum, de qua n. 8815, ita commune revelationis, nam verum Divinum est revelatio, ac id quod medio caelo manifestatur est commune {1}respective ad ipsum verum Divinum in caelo, {2}est enim extra 
seu circum, n. 8815, et quod circum et extra est, id commune est respective ad id quod in medio seu quod intra est; et ex significatione `vadere et fortificare se' quod sit increscentia ejus, nam 
se habet hoc sicut sonus qui in alto ubi purior atmosphaera est, qui tacitus, at cum descendit ad inferiora ubi atmosphaera (x)est crassior, {3}quod sit grandior et sonantior; {4}ita Divinum Verum et 
Divinum Bonum, haec in supremis sunt pacifica et prorsus nullius turbae, at cum delabuntur versus inferiora, per gradus impacifica et tandem tumultuosa; haec describuntur ita a Domino ad Eliam, cum erat 
in Chorebo, in Libro Primo Regum, Exi et consiste in monte ante Jehovam; ecce Jehovah praeteriens; ita ut ventus magnus et fortis disrumpens montes, et diffringens petras ante Jehovam; non in vento 
Jehovah; dein post ventum terrae motus, non tamen in terrae motu Jehovah; post terrae motum ignis, non in igne Jehovah; denique post ignem vox (x)silentii tenuis, xix 11, 12. @1 i revelationis$  @2
