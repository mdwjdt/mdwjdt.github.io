<h3 align="center" class="ired">属天的奥秘 第2636节</h3>
<h4 align="center"></h4><p><strong>2636.</strong>“亚伯拉罕年一百岁”表合一的完满状态。这从“一百”和“岁”的含义清楚可知：稍后会看到，“一百”表完满；“岁”（即年，year）是指状态（参看<a href="482.htm">482</a>，<a href="487.htm">487</a>，<a href="488.htm">488</a>，<a href="493.htm">493</a>，<a href="893.htm">893</a>节），在此是指合一的状态。至于何为主的神性与其人性，或也可说与其理性（因为人性始于理性的至内在部分，<a href="2106.htm">2106</a>，<a href="2194.htm">2194</a>节）合一的完满状态，这很难以可理解的方式表述出来，但仍能通过正经历改造和重生之人所具有的、被称为完满状态的事来加以说明。<br />众所周知，人只有成年后才能重生，因为到那时，他才能行使理性和判断，并由此能从主接受善与真。在他进入这种状态之前，主一直在预备他，预备的方式就是将诸如能服务于他的那类事物，作为接受善与真之种的土壤而植入在他里面。纯真和仁爱的很多状态，以及对善与真的认知，和源于它们的思维就是这样被植入的。在他开始重生之前，这种植入的预备状态会持续很多年。当人充满这些事物，并由此被预备好之后，他的状态可以说完满了。因为那时，他的内层已经为接受预备好了。主在人重生之前所赐予他、使他借以重生的所有这些事物就被称为余留。在圣言中，余留用数字“十”来表示（<a href="576.htm">576</a>，<a href="1738.htm">1738</a>，<a href="2284.htm">2284</a>节），当重生的状态完满时，也用“一百”来表示（<a href="1988.htm">1988</a>节）。<br />这些事有助于说明人性与神性在主里面合一的完满状态表示什么。也就是说，它们有助于说明主在这个时候的状态：即当主靠自己的力量，通过试探的争战和胜利，凭借神性智慧聪明的力量，为自己积聚大量神性在人性，就是理性里面，以致祂能将这神性本身联结到所获得的、在理性里面的神性上。为了能代表这种状态，尽管亚伯拉罕在迦南地住了很多年，但直到他一百岁了，才给他生了以撒。这些就是“一百岁”这个数字，也就是亚伯拉罕的年纪所包含的奥秘。<br />数字“一百”表完满，这从圣言中的其它经文明显看出来。如以赛亚书：<br />那里必不再有数日夭亡的婴孩，也没有未满日子的老者；因为百岁死的儿子仍算孩童，百岁儿子的罪人算被咒诅。（以赛亚书<a href="http://39-27.cn/赛65.20.htm">65:20</a>）<br />此处一“百”明显表完满，因为经上说“那里必不再有数日夭亡的婴孩，也没有未满日子的老者”，以及百岁的孩童和罪人；也就是说，他的状态完满之时。<br />马太福音：<br />凡为我的名撇下房屋或是弟兄、姐妹、父亲、母亲、妻子、儿女、田地的，必要得着百倍，并且承受永生。（马太福音<a href="http://39-27.cn/太19.29.htm">19:29</a>；马可福音<a href="http://39-27.cn/可10.29.htm">10:29</a>-<a href="http://39-27.cn/可10.30.htm">30</a>）<br />此处“百倍”表完满，或“连摇带按倒下来的十足升斗”（路加福音<a href="http://39-27.cn/路6.38.htm">6:38</a>）。<br />路加福音：<br />又有落在好土里的种子，生长起来，结实百倍。（路加福音<a href="http://39-27.cn/路8.8.htm">8:8</a>；马太福音<a href="http://39-27.cn/太13.8.htm">13:8</a>，<a href="http://39-27.cn/太13.23.htm">23</a>；马可福音<a href="http://39-27.cn/可4.20.htm">4:20</a>）<br />此处一“百”表完满，这个数字若非有这样的含义，就不会被提及。主谈及欠债者所用的比喻也一样，即这个人欠“一百篓（每篓约五十斤）油”，那个人欠“一百石麦子”（路加福音<a href="http://39-27.cn/路16.5.htm">16:5</a>-<a href="http://39-27.cn/路16.7.htm">7</a>）。这同样适用于其它提及一百的地方。“一千”的情形也是如此，关于这个数字，可参看前文（<a href="2575.htm">2575</a>节）。</p>

<p align="center"><b>Potts(1905-1910) 2636</b></p><p><b>2636.</b>
Abraham was a son of a hundred years. That this signifies a full state of unition, is evident from the signification of a "hundred," as being what is full (concerning which presently); and from the signification 
of "years," as being state (see n. 482, 487, 488, 493, 893); here, a state of unition. What a full state of unition of the Lord's Divine with His Human is, or what is the same, with His rational 
(for the human begins in the inmost of the rational, n. 2106, 2194), cannot so well be told to the apprehension, but still can be illustrated by what is called with man a full state when he is 
being reformed and regenerated. [2] It is known that a man cannot be regenerated until adult age, because he then for the first time has the full exercise of reason and judgment, and thus can receive 
good and truth from the Lord. Before he comes into this state he is being prepared by the Lord by such things being insinuated into him as may serve him as ground for receiving the seeds of good and 
truth; which are the many states of innocence and charity, and also the knowledges of good and truth, and the thoughts derived from them. This preparation is going on for some years before his regeneration 
commences. When the man has been imbued with these things, and is thus prepared, his state is then said to be full; for his interiors are then disposed for receiving. All those things with which 
a man is endowed by the Lord before regeneration, and by means of which he is regenerated, are called remains, which are signified in the Word by the number "ten" (n. 576, 1738, 2284); and also by a 
"hundred," when the state for regeneration is full (n. 1988). [3] These things may serve for illustration as to what is signified by a full state of unition of the Human with the Divine in the Lord, 
namely, when from His own power, by means of the combats of temptations and by victories, and by the powers of the Divine wisdom and intelligence, He had procured to Himself so much of the Divine in 
His Human, that is, in His rational, as to be able to unite the Divine Itself to the Divine acquired in the rational. That this state might be represented, it was brought to pass that, although Abraham 
had dwelt for many years in the land of Canaan, Isaac was not born to him until he was a hundred years old. These are the arcana contained in the number a "hundred years," which was Abraham's age. [4] 
That the number a "hundred" signifies what is full, is evident from other passages in the Word, as in Isaiah: </p>
<p>     There shall be no more thence an infant of days, nor an old man that hath not filled 
His days; for the child shall die a son of a hundred years, and the sinner a son of a hundred years shall be accursed (Isa. 65:20); </p>
<p>where a "hundred" manifestly denotes what is full; for it is said, 
there shall be no more an infant of days, nor an old man that hath not filled his days, and a child and a sinner of a hundred years; that is, when his state is full. [5] In Matthew: </p>
<p>     Everyone 
that hath left houses, or brethren, or sisters, or father, or mother, or wife, or children, or lands, for My name's sake, shall receive a hundredfold, and shall inherit eternal life (Matt. 19:29; Mark 
10:29-30); </p>
<p>where a "hundredfold" denotes what is full; or "good measure, pressed down, shaken together, running over" (Luke 6:38). [6] And in Luke: </p>
<p>     And other seed fell upon the good earth 
and having sprung up it brought forth fruit a hundredfold (Luke 8:8; Matt. 13:8, 23; Mark 4:20); </p>
<p>where also a "hundred" denotes what is full, which number would not have been mentioned unless it had 
signified that. The same is true where the Lord speaks by parable concerning the debtors, that one owed "a hundred baths of oil," and the other "a hundred cors of wheat" (Luke 16:5-7). So also in other 
places where a "hundred" is mentioned. The case is similar with a "thousand," respecting which number, see above (n. 2575). </p>

<p align="center"><b>Elliott(1983-1999) 2636</b></p><p><b>2636.</b>
'Abraham was a son a hundred years old' means a complete state of union. This is clear from the meaning of 'a hundred' as that which is complete, dealt with immediately below, and from the meaning of 
'years' as state, dealt with in <a href="482.htm">482</a>, <a href="487.htm">487</a>, <a href="488.htm">488</a>, <a href="493.htm">493</a>, <a href="893.htm">893</a>, here a state of union. What a complete state is of the Lord's Divine united to His Human, or what amounts to the same, united to the Rational 
- for the human has its beginnings in the inmost part of the rational, <a href="2106.htm">2106</a>, <a href="2194.htm">2194</a> - is not easy to express in a way that can be understood, though it can nevertheless be illustrated by the things which 
with man are called a complete state when he is being reformed and regenerated. </p>
<p></p>
<p><b>[2]</b>
 It is well known that a person cannot be regenerated except in adult years, for not until then is he able to exercise 
reason and judgement and in so doing to receive good and truth from the Lord. Before entering that state he is being prepared by the Lord through the implantation of such things as can serve him 
as the soil for receiving the seeds of truth and good. Implanted thus are many states of innocence and charity, also cognitions of good and truth, and consequently thoughts. This implantation occurs 
during many years before his regeneration takes place. When a person has been endowed with these things and so has been prepared, his state is now said to be complete, for the things that are interior 
have been arranged ready to receive. All those things with a person which the Lord grants him prior to regeneration and by means of which he is regenerated are called remnants, which in the Word are 
meant by the number ten, <a href="576.htm">576</a>, <a href="1738.htm">1738</a>, <a href="2284.htm">2284</a>, and also by a hundred when the state for regeneration is complete, <a href="1988.htm">1988</a>. </p>
<p></p>
<p><b>[3]</b>
 These things that are so with man may serve to illustrate what is meant by a 
complete state of the Human united to the Divine in the Lord. That is to say, they may illustrate the state when the Lord by His own power - through the conflicts brought about by temptations and through 
victories, and through the powers of Divine wisdom and intelligence - gathered to Himself within the Human, that is, within the Rational, so much of the Divine that He was able to unite the Divine 
itself to the Divine acquired within the Rational. And it was to represent this state that, even though Abraham had spent many years in the land of Canaan, Isaac was not born to him until he was a hundred 
years old. These are the arcana contained within the number 'a hundred years', which was Abraham's age. </p>
<p></p>
<p><b>[4]</b>
 That the number 'a hundred' means that which is complete may also be seen from other 
places in the Word, as in Isaiah, </p>
<blockquote>
No more will there be from it an infant of days, nor an old man who has not completed his days, for the child will die a son a hundred years old, and the sinner 
a son a hundred years old will be accursed. <a href="http://bible.gospelcom.net/cgi-bin/bible?passage=Isa%2065:%2020&amp;version=ESV&amp;interface=print&amp;showfn=yes&amp;showxref">Isa 65: 20</a>. 
</blockquote>
<p>Here 'a hundred' clearly stands for that which is complete, for it is said, 'No more will there be an infant of days, nor an old man who has 
not completed his days', and, a child and a sinner will be 'a hundred years old', that is, a time when his state is complete. </p>
<p></p>
<p><b>[5]</b>
 In Matthew, </p>
<blockquote>
Everyone who has left houses or brothers or sisters 
or father or mother or wife or children or fields, for My name's sake, will receive a hundredfold and will be allotted the inheritance of eternal life. <a href="http://bible.gospelcom.net/cgi-bin/bible?passage=Matt%2019:%2029&amp;version=ESV&amp;interface=print&amp;showfn=yes&amp;showxref">Matt 19: 29</a>; <a href="http://bible.gospelcom.net/cgi-bin/bible?passage=Mark%2010:-29,%2030&amp;version=ESV&amp;interface=print&amp;showfn=yes&amp;showxref">Mark 10:-29, 30</a>. 
</blockquote>
<p>Here 'a hundredfold' 
stands for that which is complete, otherwise described as 'good measure, pressed down, shaken together, and running over', in <a href="http://bible.gospelcom.net/cgi-bin/bible?passage=Luke%206:-38&amp;version=ESV&amp;interface=print&amp;showfn=yes&amp;showxref">Luke 6:-38</a>. </p>
<p></p>
<p><b>[6]</b>
 In Luke, </p>
<blockquote>
Some seed fell on good ground, and 
when it had grown up it brought forth fruit a hundredfold. <a href="http://bible.gospelcom.net/cgi-bin/bible?passage=Luke%208:%208&amp;version=ESV&amp;interface=print&amp;showfn=yes&amp;showxref">Luke 8: 8</a>; <a href="http://bible.gospelcom.net/cgi-bin/bible?passage=Matt%2013:%208,%2023&amp;version=ESV&amp;interface=print&amp;showfn=yes&amp;showxref">Matt 13: 8, 23</a>; <a href="http://bible.gospelcom.net/cgi-bin/bible?passage=Mark%204:-20&amp;version=ESV&amp;interface=print&amp;showfn=yes&amp;showxref">Mark 4:-20</a>. 
</blockquote>
<p>Here also 'a hundred' stands for that which is complete, a number which would not have been mentioned 
unless it had had that meaning. A similar meaning exists in the parable about the debtors, where the Lord says that one owed a hundred baths of oil and the other a hundred cors of wheat, <a href="http://bible.gospelcom.net/cgi-bin/bible?passage=Luke%2016:-5-7&amp;version=ESV&amp;interface=print&amp;showfn=yes&amp;showxref">Luke 16:-5-7</a>. The same applies in other places where a hundred is mentioned. It is similar with a thousand, regarding which number, see <a href="2575.htm">2575</a>. </p>

`Abraham filius centum annorum': quod significet plenum statum unitionis, constat a significatione `centum' quod sit plenum, de qua in mox sequentibus, et a significatione `annorum' quod sit status, 
de qua n. 482, 487, 488, 493, 893, hic, status unitionis.  Quid plenus status unitionis Divini Domini cum Humano Ipsius, seu quod idem, cum Rationali, nam humanum incipit in intimo rationalis, n. 2106, 
2194, non ita ad captum dici potest, sed usque illustrari per illa quae apud hominem vocantur plenus status, cum reformatur et regeneratur: [2] notum est quod homo non possit regenerari quam in ad 
adulta aetate, quia tunc primum ratione et judicio pollet, ac ita recipere potest (t)bonum et verum a Domino; antequam in statum illum venit, praeparatur ille a Domino per id quod insinuentur ei talia 
quae inservire possint ei pro humo recipiendi semina veri et boni, quae sunt plure Status innocentiae et charitatis, tum etiam cognitiones boni et veri, et inde cogitationes, quod fit per plures annos 
antequam regeneratur; quando homo illis imbutus est, et sic praeparatus, tunc dicitur statu ejus plenus, nam tunc interiora disposita sunt ad recipiendum; apud hominem appellantur omnia illa quibus 
donatur a Domino ante regenerationem et per quae regeneratur, `reliquiae,' quae in Verbo significantur per numerum `decem,' n. 576, 1738, 2284, tum quoque per `centum,' cum plenus status est regenerationi 
{1}, n. 1988: [3] haec illustrationi esse possunt, quid significatur per plenum statum unitionis Humani cum Divino in Domino, nempe, cum Ipse ex propria potentis per pugnas tentationum et victorias, 
et per potentias Divinae sapientiae et intelligentiae, tantum Divini in Humano, hoc est, (o)in Rationali Sibi comparavit, ut Ipsum Divinum unire posset Divino acquisito in Rationali: ut hic status 
repraesentaretur, factum est quod Abrahamo, tametsi per plures annos moratus in terra Canaane, non prius nasceretur Jishak, quam cum esset aetate centum annorum: haec sunt arcana quae in numero `centum 
annorum,' quae fuerunt Abrahamo, continentur.  [4] Quod numerus `centum' significet plenum, constare quoque {2} potest ab aliis locis in Verbo, ut apud Esaiam, 	Non erit inde amplius infans dierum, 
et senex qui non impleverit dies suos, nam puer filius centum annorum morietur, et peccator filius centum annorum maledicetur, lxv 20; </p>
<p>ubi manifeste `centum' pro pleno, nam dicitur `non erit amplius 
infans dierum (o)et senex, qui non impleverit dies (o)suos, et puer ac peccator {3}, centum annorum,' hoc est, cum plenus status ejus: [5] apud Matthaeum, 	Omnis qui reliquerit domos, aut fratres, 
aut sorores, aut patrem, aut matrem, aut uxorem, aut liberos, aut agros, propter nomen Meum, centuplum accipiet, et vitae aeternae sortietur hereditatem, xix 29; Marc. x 29, 30; </p>
<p>ubi `centuplum' pro pleno, 
seu `mensura bona, pressa, agitata et superfluente,' Luc. vi 38: [6] apud Lucam, 	Aliud semen cecidit super terram bonam, et enatum fecit fructum centuplum, viii 8; Matth. xiii 8, 23; Marc. iv 
20; </p>
<p>ubi `centum' etiam pro pleno, qui numerus non dictus fuisset nisi id significavisset: sint aliter ubi Dominus per parabolam loquitur de debitoribus, quod 	Unus deberet centum batos olei, et alter 
centum coros tritici, Luc.(x) xvi 5-7; </p>
<p>ita quoque alibi ubi centum nominatur; similiter se habet cum mille, de quo numero videatur n. 2575. 	@1 T suggests regenerationis.$ 	@2 After aliis.$ 	@3 filius.$ </p>
