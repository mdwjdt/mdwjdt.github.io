<h3 align="center" class="ired">属天的奥秘 第1935节</h3>
<h4 align="center"></h4><p><strong>1935.</strong>“耶和华的天使对她说”表主的内层人给出的答复。这从“耶和华的天使”的含义清楚可知，前面说过（<a href="1925.htm">1925</a>节），“耶和华的天使”表主的内层思维，并且既表思维，故也表答复。主的内层思维源于对智性真理的情感，而这情感则源于神性良善本身。如前所述，这种思维从来不存在于任何人里面，也不可能存在于人里面。即便如此，人里面仍有从主经由他的内在人流入内层理性人的内层思维。它存在于有良知的人里面，这从以下事实清楚看出来：他们能在其外在人中发现与内层人的善与真相冲突的恶与假。不过，这种思维相对低级得多，根本无法与主的思维相提并论。主的思维源于对智性真理的情感，是祂自己所特有的。然而，没有良知的人不可能具有内层思维，因此他们也不会经历冲突。其原因在于，他们的理性活动与肉体感官活动行如一体，是一样的。尽管他们也有从主那里而来的善与真的持续流注，但他们对此毫无察觉。因为他们会立刻窒息并扼杀它，这就是为何他们不相信任何信之真理。</p>

The Angel of Jehovah said. That this signifies the response of the Lord's interior man, is evident from the signification of "the Angel of Jehovah," as being the Lord's interior thought (spoken of above, 
n. 1925); and because it is thought, it is also response. The Lord's interior thought was from the affection of intellectual truth, and this affection was from the Divine good itself. Such thought, 
as before said, never exists in any man, nor can do so. In man also there is interior thought that flows in from the Lord through his internal man into the interior rational, with those who have conscience, 
as may be seen from the fact that they can observe the evil and falsity in their external man that is in conflict with the good and truth in the interior man. This thought is much lower and 
is not in any way to be compared to that of the Lord, which was from the affection of intellectual truth and was proper and peculiar to Him. But they who have not conscience cannot have interior thought, 
and therefore there is no conflict, the reason of which is that their rational acts as one and the same with the corporeal sensual; and though there is in them also a continual influx of good and 
truth from the Lord, yet they have no perception of it, because they forthwith extinguish and suffocate it, and this is why they do not believe any truth of faith.  </p>

That 'the angel of Jehovah said' means the reply given by the Lord's Interior Man is clear from the meaning of 'the angel of Jehovah' as the Lord's interior thought, dealt with above in <a href="1925.htm">1925</a>; and because 
thought is meant, reply is meant as well. The Lord's interior thought sprang from the affection for intellectual truth, and that affection sprang from Divine Good itself. Such thought, as stated 
already, does not ever exist with anyone, nor can it do so. Even so, an interior type of thought exists in man which flows in from the Lord through his internal man into the interior rational. It exists 
in people who have conscience, as becomes clear from the fact that they are able to take notice of the evil and falsity that are present in their external man and that assault the good and truth in 
the interior man. But such thought comes far below, and is not in any way comparable to, the Lord's, which sprang from the affection for intellectual truth and was peculiarly His own. People however 
who do not have conscience cannot possess interior thought, and therefore they do not experience conflict, the reason being that the activity of their rational is one and the same as the activity of their 
physical senses. And although with them also there is a constant influx of good and truth from the Lord they nevertheless do not perceive it, for they instantly put a stop to it and smother it; and 
this is why they do not believe any truth of faith. </p>

`Dixit angelus Jehovae': quod significet Interioris Hominis Domini responsum, constat ex significatione `angeli Jehovae' quod sit interior cogitatio Domini, de qua supra n. 1925; et quia est cogitatio, 
etiam est responsum. Interior cogitatio Domini fuit ex affectione veri intellectualis, et haec affectio (c)ex Ipso Divino Bono; talis cogitatio, ut prius dictum, nusquam apud aliquem hominem est nec 
esse potest: apud hominem {1}etiam est interior cogitatio quae influit per internum ejus hominem in interiorem rationalem a Domino, apud eos qui conscientiam habent, quod constare potest ex eo quod 
animadvertere possint malum et falsum quod in externo suo homine, quod pugnat contra bonum et verum in interiore; {2}at haec cogitatio est multo inferior, non comparanda ullo modo cum Domini, quae fuit 
ex affectione veri intellectualis, (t)fuit et Ipsius propria:  qui autem conscientiam non habent, interiorem cogitationem non habere possunt, quare nec apud eos ulla pugna est; causa est quia rationale 
eorum unum et idem agit cum sensuali corporeo; et tametsi apud eos quoque {3}continue influit bonum et verum a Domino, usque illud non appercipiunt quia ilico id exstinguunt et suffocant, inde est 
quod {4}nec credant aliquod verum fidei. @1 quoque$ @2 et I$ @3 continuo I$ @4 non$ </p>
