<h4 align="center"></h4><p><strong>313.</strong>根据以上有关第一个人的描述，显然，今日之人被遗传的恶并非全都源自于他。这是一个错误的推想，因为此处以“人”之名所论述的是上古教会。当他被称为“亚当”时，表示那人是从土里出来的，也就是说，因为被主重生，他从非人变成了人。这是“亚当”一名的起源和内涵。<br />至于恶的遗传，情况是这样：人若实际造罪，就在他身上留下印记。该恶被植入他的儿女，成为可遗传的。所以，它源自父母，父母的父母，父母的父母的父母。在遗传的过程中，它不断积累，传到每个人身上，又因每个人实际造罪而不断增强。它不可能凭空消失，变得无害，除非被主重生。留心之人不难发现该事实的证据，因为父母的罪恶倾向在其孩子身上依然清晰可见，以致每个家庭乃至整个民族，也能因此与其它家庭或民族区分开来。</p>

<p><strong>[NCE]313.</strong> From the statements now made about the first human it can be seen that this person did not pass an evil heredity on to everyone alive today and that popular belief is wrong in saying we have no inherited evil except what sprang from that source.{*1} It is the primeval church that is the subject here and that is being called "the human." When the name Adam is used, it symbolizes the idea that humankind was taken from the ground, or that from being nonhuman, people were made human, in being regenerated by the Lord.{*2} This is the origin and this is the meaning of the name.<br />The truth about inherited evil is that any of us who have actually committed a sin have imposed on ourselves a nature rising out of that sin. The evil is then implanted in our children and becomes hereditary. So it comes from every parent, from every grandparent, great-grandparent, great-great-grandparent, and so on back in order. In this way it multiplies and grows in each succeeding generation and remains with every one of us — and our own sinful deeds add to it. It does not weaken to the point of harmlessness except in those whom the Lord regenerates.<br />Anyone who pays attention can see this by considering that the bad tendencies of parents remain visible in their children, so that one family can be distinguished from another, and in fact one generation from another.<br /><br /><strong>Footnotes:</strong><br />{*1} Swedenborg is here attacking the notion of original sin, the idea that all humans inherited the primordial sin of Adam, a doctrine first articulated by Augustine. See Kelly 1960, 361-366. As exemplified in the rest of this section, Swedenborg applies the word "sin" only to evil acts committed by an individual. The imprint of these is passed on to children in the form of hereditary evil, which is an inborn state of loving oneself more than others (<a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_313/swedenborg_divine-providence-dole_277" target=_top>Divine Providence 277</a>a). In short, Swedenborg rejects the idea that all humans are born in a sinful state as a consequence of the sin of Adam, and asserts instead that each person's state of hereditary evil comes from her or his biological parents (<a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_313/swedenborg_apocalypse-revealed-rogers_776" target=_top>Revelation Unveiled 776</a>; <a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_313/swedenborg_conjugial-love-rogers_525" target=_top>Marriage Love 525:1</a>; <a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_313/swedenborg_true-christian-religion-chadwick_469" target=_top>True Christianity 469</a>). At <a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_313/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_494#subsection-2-2" target=_top>494:2</a> below, he states that hereditary evil is the primary cause of the decline of every church. See also the discussion of inherited evil in the reader's guide, page 42 note 31 [NCBSP: Available from Swedenborg Foundation]. [RS, LSW]<br />{*2} אָדָם ('āḏām) is the Hebrew word for humankind; it can be translated as "Adam" or as "a human," "the human race," and so forth. It is related to the word for "ground," אֲדָמָה ('ăḏāmā). The Latin captures the flavor of the Hebrew, since the word for a human is homo and "from the ground" is ex humo. [LHC] </p>
<p align="center"><b>Potts(1905-1910) 313</b></p><p><b>313.</b>
From what is here said of the first man, it is evident that all the hereditary evil existing at the present day did not come from him, as is falsely supposed. For it is the Most Ancient Church that is 
here treated of under the name of "man;" and when it is called "Adam" it signifies that man was from the ground, or that from being non-man he became man by regeneration from the Lord. This is the origin 
and signification of the name. But as to hereditary evil, the case is this. Everyone who commits actual sin thereby induces on himself a nature, and the evil from it is implanted in his children, 
and becomes hereditary. It thus descends from every parent, from the father, grandfather, great-grandfather, and their ancestors in succession, and is thus multiplied and augmented in each descending 
posterity, remaining with each person, and being increased in each by his actual sins, and never being dissipated so as to become harmless except in those who are being regenerated by the Lord. Every 
attentive observer may see evidence of this truth in the fact that the evil inclinations of parents remain visibly in their children, so that one family, and even an entire race, may be thereby distinguished 
from every other. </p>

<p align="center"><b>Elliott(1983-1999) 313</b></p><p><b>313.</b>
These facts that have now been stated concerning the first man show that he is not the source of hereditary evil existing in everyone alive today, and that people are wrong if they imagine that no other 
hereditary evil exists apart from that which emanated from that first man. For the subject here is the Most Ancient Church, which is called 'Man'. When it is called Adam it means that man was taken 
from the ground; that is, from not being 'man' that Church became man through regeneration from the Lord. This is the derivation' and the meaning of that name. As for hereditary evil the situation is 
this: Everyone who by his own actions commits sin consequently acquires a certain disposition, and the evil arising from it is implanted in his children and becomes hereditary. Thus what a person inherits 
from either parent, from his grandfather, great-grandfather, great-great-grandfather and so on back, accordingly multiplies and increases in his descendants, and remains with each one. And with 
each one it is increased further still by the sins of his own doing. Nor is hereditary evil dispersed and rendered harmless except with people who are being regenerated by the Lord. This anyone can recognize, 
if he has paid the matter any attention at all, from the fact that the evil inclinations of parents are so noticeable in children that one family, indeed one generation, can be distinguished 
from another by means of it.

<p align="center"><b>Latin(1748-1756) 313</b>
</p><b>313.</b>
Ex his quae de primo homine nunc dicta sunt, constare potest quod ex illo non hereditarium malum usque in omnes qui hodie vivunt, et, sicut false putant, quod nullum aliud hereditarium malum sit quam 
quod inde scaturiverit; est enim Antiquissima Ecclesia de qua ibi agitur, et vocatur 'homo'; qui dum vocatur 'Adam,' significat quod homo ex humo, seu quod homo factus a non homine, per regenerationem 
a Domino; haec nominis est origo, et haec nominis significatio. Sed hereditarium malum se ita habet quod unusquisque qui actuale peccatum committit, is sibi inde inducat naturam, et malum inde implantatur 
liberis et fit hereditarium, ita a parente unoquovis, ab ejus avo, proavo, atavo, et antecedentibus ordine, quod sic multiplicatur et crescit in ejus posteritate descendente, et remanet apud unumquemvis, 
atque apud unumquemvis augetur per actualia ejus peccata; nec dissipatur sic ut non noceat, quam apud eos qui a Domino regenerantur. Hoc quisque, si attenderit, scire potest ex eo quod malae 
parentum inclinationes visibiliter maneant in liberis, ita ut una familia, immo una generatio, ab altera inde queat dignosci. </p>
