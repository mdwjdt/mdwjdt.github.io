<h4 align="center"></h4><p><strong>156.</strong>创世记2:23 那人说，现在，这是我骨中的骨，肉中的肉，应当称她为妻子，因为她是从男人身上取出来的。<br />“骨中的骨，肉中的肉”表外在的自我，“骨”，表该自我尚未获得生气，“肉”，表该自我已被赋予生气。“男人”，表内在，当它与外在结合，之前被称为“女人”的自我在此就改称为“妻子”。“现在”，表已经成就，因为状态已发生改变。</p>

<p><strong>[NCE]156.</strong> <a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_156/bible_king-james-version_genesis_2_23" target=_top>Genesis 2:23</a>. And the human said, "This time, bone from my bones and flesh from my flesh. This is why she will be called ‘wife': because she was taken from man."{*1} Bone from one's bones and flesh from one's flesh symbolizes the sense of autonomy of our outer being; bone symbolizes that autonomy without much life, and flesh symbolizes that autonomy with life. The man, though, symbolizes our inner being, and because the inner being is intimately coupled with the outer being, as the next verse says, this desire to rule ourselves is here called a wife — the term used in the next verse — instead of a woman as before.{*2} This time means that it has now been accomplished, because our state has changed.{*3} <br /><strong>Footnotes:</strong><br />{*1} For this derivation of the word "wife" from "man," see note 6 in <a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_156/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_130" target=_top>130</a>. [RS]<br />{*2} Although in Swedenborg's Latin the word "woman" (Latin mulier) is used in <a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_156/bible_king-james-version_genesis_2_22" target=_top>Genesis 2:22</a> and the word "wife" (Latin uxor) is used in verses <a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_156/bible_king-james-version_genesis_2_23-25" target=_top>23-25</a>, the same Hebrew word אִישָּׁה ('îššā) underlies them both. In making this change here from "woman" to "wife" Swedenborg follows a long-standing tradition in Latin translations of the Bible. [JSR]<br />{*3} Presumably what was accomplished was the acquisition of autonomy. [LHC] </p>

Verse 23. And the man said, This now is bone of my bones and flesh of my flesh; therefore she shall be called wife, because she was taken out of man [vir]. "Bone of bones and flesh of flesh" signify 
the Own of the external man; "bone" this Own not so much vivified, and "flesh" the Own that is vivified. Man [vir], moreover, signifies the internal man, and from his being so coupled with the external 
man as is stated in the subsequent verse, the Own which was before called "woman" is here denominated "wife." "Now" signifies that it was thus effected at this time because the state was changed. </p>

<p align="center"><b>Elliott(1983-1999) 156</b></p><p><b>156.</b>
Verse 23 And the man said, By this change, it is bone from my bones and flesh from my flesh; for this she will be called Wife, because she was taken out of man (vir).  </p>
<p>'Bone from bones and flesh from 
flesh' means the proprium belonging to the external man, 'bone' the proprium that has been given not much life, 'flesh' the proprium that has been given life. 'The man' (vir) however means the internal 
man. And because, as is said in the next verse, the internal man was so coupled to the external man, this proprium previously called 'woman' is now called 'Wife'. 'By this change' means that it 
happened now, because there had been a change of state.

</p><b>156.</b>
Vers. 23.  Et dixit homo, Hac vice, os de ossibus meis, et caro de carne mea; propter hoc vocabitur uxor, quia ex viro sumpta illa. 'Os de ossibus, et caro de carne' significat proprium externi hominis; 
'os,' proprium non ita vivificatum; 'caro,' proprium vivificatum: 'vir' autem significat internum hominem, qui quia copulatus est externo homini ita ut in versu sequente dicitur, vocatur proprium 
hoc 'uxor,' quae prius 'mulier': 'hac vice' significat quod nunc ita factum sit, quia mutatus status. </p>
