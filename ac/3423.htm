<h3 align="center" class="ired">属天的奥秘 第3423节</h3>
<h4 align="center"></h4><p><strong>3423.</strong>创世记26:19-21.以撒的仆人在山谷中挖井，在那里得了一口活水井。基拉耳的牧人与以撒的牧人争竞说，这水是我们的。以撒就给那井起名叫埃色，因为他们和他相争。他们又挖了一口井，又为这井争竞，以撒给这井起名叫西提拿。 <br />“以撒的仆人在山谷中挖井，在那里得了一口活水井”表含有内义在里面的圣言字义。“基拉耳的牧人与以撒的牧人争竞”表那些教导的人看不到其中任何此类事物，因为内义中的事物与字义中的事物看似相反。“说，这水是我们的”表他们拥有真理。“以撒就给那井起名叫埃色，因为他们和他相争”表由于这些以及其它事反对那些教导的人，还由于除此之外的更多其它事而否认。“他们又挖了一口井，又为这井争竞”表是否存在圣言内义这回事。“以撒给这井起名叫西提拿”表它们的本质。</p>

Verses 19-21. And the servants of Isaac digged in the valley, and found there a well of living waters. And the shepherds of Gerar strove with Isaac's shepherds, saying, The waters are ours; and he called 
the name of the well Esek, because they contended with him. And they digged another well, and they strove over that also, and he called the name of it Sitnah. "And the servants of Isaac digged in 
the valley, and found there a well of living waters," signifies the Word as to the literal sense in which is the internal sense; "and the shepherds of Gerar strove with Isaac's shepherds," signifies 
that they who taught did not see any such thing therein, because the senses appear opposed; "saying, The waters are ours," signifies that they are in the truth; "and he called the name of the well Esek, 
because they contended with him," signifies denial on these accounts as well as on others, in being against the teachers, and on account of other things besides; "and they digged another well, and 
they strove over that also," signifies the internal sense of the Word, as to whether it has any existence; "and he called the name of it Sitnah," signifies their quality. </p>

Verses 19-21 And Isaac's servants dug in the valley and found there a well of living water. And the herdsmen of Gerar disputed with Isaac's herdsmen, saying, The water is ours. And he called the name 
of the well Esek, because they contended with him. And they dug another well and disputed over that also; and he called the name of it Sitnah. 'Isaac's servants dug in the valley and found there a well 
of living water' means the Word as regards the literal sense, which holds the internal sense within it. 'And the herdsmen of Gerar disputed with Isaac's herdsmen' means that those who taught did not 
see anything of the sort there, because things in the internal sense appear contrary to those in the literal. 'Saying, The water is ours' means that they possess the truth. 'And he called the name of 
the well Esek, because they contended with him' means an attitude of denial on account of those things, and also of others, as being contrary to those persons, and on account of more things besides. 
'And they dug another well and disputed over that also' means whether the internal sense of the Word even exists. 'And he called the name of it Sitnah' means their essential nature. </p>

</p><b>3423.</b>
Vers.  19-21.  Et foderunt servi Jishaki in valle, et invenerunt ibi puteum aquarum vivarum. Et rixati sunt pastores Geraris cum pastoribus Jishaki, dicendo, Nobis aquae, et vocavit nomen putei Esek, 
quia contenderunt cum eo. Et foderunt puteum alium, et rixati etiam super illo, et vocavit nomen illius Sitnah. `Foderunt servi Jishaki in valle, et invenerunt ibi puteum aquarum vivarum' significat 
Verbum quoad sensum litteralem in quo internus: `et rixati sunt pastores Geraris cum pastoribus Jishaki' significat quod docentes non viderent ibi tale, quia apparent opposita: `dicendo, Nobis aquae' 
significat quod illi in vero sint: `et vocavit nomen putei Esek, quia contenderunt cum eo' significat negationem ob illa, tum ob alia, quod contra illos, et ob plura: `et foderunt puteum alium, et rixati 
etiam super illo' significat sensum internum Verbi num sit: `et vocavit nomen illius Sitnah' significat quale eorum. </p>
