<h3 align="center" class="ired">属天的奥秘 第5121节</h3>
<h4 align="center"></h4><p><strong>5121.</strong>“约瑟对他说，你所作的梦是这样解”表就它里面所包含的东西而言，由通过属世层里面的属天层得来的觉知所产生的启示。这从“说”和“解”的含义，以及“约瑟”的代表清楚可知：在圣言的历史部分，“说”是指觉知（<a href="1791.htm">1791</a>，<a href="1815.htm">1815</a>，<a href="1819.htm">1819</a>，<a href="1822.htm">1822</a>，<a href="1898.htm">1898</a>，<a href="1919.htm">1919</a>，<a href="2080.htm">2080</a>，<a href="2619.htm">2619</a>，<a href="2862.htm">2862</a>，<a href="3395.htm">3395</a>，<a href="3509.htm">3509</a>节），在此是指由觉知所产生的启示，因为所论述的主题是梦，以及对它的讲解，一切启示要么是与主说话所藉由的天使交谈的结果，要么是觉知的结果，如下文述；“约瑟”是指属世层里面的属天层，如前所述（<a href="5086.htm">5086</a>，<a href="5087.htm">5087</a>，<a href="5106.htm">5106</a>节）；“解”是指它里面所包含的东西，也如前所述（<a href="5093.htm">5093</a>，<a href="5105.htm">5105</a>，<a href="5107.htm">5107</a>节）。由此明显可知，“约瑟对他说，你所作的梦是这样解”表示就它里面所包含的东西而言，由通过属世层里面的属天层得来的觉知所产生的启示。<br />至于启示要么来自觉知，要么来自主说话所藉由的天使，要知道：那些处于良善，并由此处于真理的人，尤其那些处于对主之爱的良善之人便拥有来自觉知的启示；而那些未处于良善，并由此处于真理的人的确能拥有启示，但没有来自觉知的启示，只有通过他们所听见在他们里面说话的声音，因而通过来自主的天使而临到他们身上的启示。这种启示是外在的，而前一种是内在的。天使，尤其属天天使便拥有如上古教会成员，以及某些古教会成员所拥有的那种来自觉知的启示；但如今几乎没有人能获得这种启示。许许多多的人，包括那些未处于良善的人从与天使的交谈那里获得没有任何觉知的启示；那些通过异象或梦获得启示的人也一样。<br />犹太教会中的先知所获得的启示大多属这类；他们听见声音，看见异象，作梦。但由于他们没有觉知，所以这些只是口头或视觉上的启示，没有对它们所表之物的任何觉知。因为真正的觉知从主经由天堂而来；它以属灵的观念充满理解力，以可觉知的方式引导理解力顺着事物的真正性质思考，并从内在认识该性质。这种认识能力的源头不得而知，但理解力却以为它在自己里面开始，源于它在里面所呈现的相互关联的观念。而事实上，这种能力是经由天堂从主而来的一种命令；它流入对于上面超出属世层和感官层的事物，也就是属于灵界或天堂的那类事物的思维内层。由此可见何为来自觉知的启示。不过，此处由“约瑟”所代表的主所拥有的来自觉知的启示（这种启示是此处内义上所论述的主题）源于祂自己里面的神性，因而源于祂自己。</p>

And Joseph said unto him, This is the interpretation of it. That this signifies revelation from perception from the celestial in the natural as to what it had in itself, is evident from the signification 
of "saying" in the historic parts of the Word, as being perception (n. 1791, 1815, 1819, 1822, 1898, 1919, 2080, 2619, 2862, 3395, 3509), here revelation from perception, because said of a dream 
and its interpretation - all revelation being either from speech with angels through whom the Lord speaks, or from perception (of which hereafter); and from the representation of Joseph, as being the 
celestial in the natural (of which above, n. 5086, 5087, 5106); and from the signification of "interpretation," as being what it had in itself (of which also above, n. 5093, 5105, 5107). From this it 
is plain that by "Joseph said unto him, This is the interpretation of it" is signified revelation from perception from the celestial in the natural as to what it had in itself, 
also dealt with above, in 5093, 5105, 5107. From this it is evident that 'Joseph said to him, This is the interpretation of it' means revelation resulting from the perception received by the celestial within 
the natural as to what it held within it. 
 </p>
<p>[2] In regard to revelations 
being either from perception, or from speech with angels through whom the Lord speaks, it is to be known that they who are in good and thence in truth, and especially they who are in the good of 
love to the Lord, have revelation from perception; whereas they who are not in good and thence in truth, can indeed have revelations, yet not from perception, but through a living voice heard within 
them, and thus through angels from the Lord. This revelation is external, but the former is internal. The angels, especially the celestial, have revelation from perception, as also had the men of the 
Most Ancient Church, and some too of the Ancient Church, but scarcely anyone at this day; whereas very many, even those who have not been in good, have had revelations from speech without perception, 
and also by means of visions or dreams. 
 </p>
<p>[3] Such were most of the revelations of the prophets in the Jewish Church; they heard a voice, they saw a vision, and they dreamed a dream; but as they had no 
perception, these were merely verbal or visual revelations without any perception of what they signified. For genuine perception comes through heaven from the Lord, and affects the intellect spiritually, 
and leads it perceptibly to think as the thing really is, together with internal assent, the source of which it knows not. It supposes that it is in itself, and that it flows from the connection 
of things; whereas it is a dictate through heaven from the Lord, flowing into the interiors of the thought, about such things as are above the natural and sensuous, that is, about such things as are of 
the spiritual world or of heaven. From what has now been said it may be seen what revelation from perception is. But the revelation from perception which the Lord had (who is here represented by Joseph, 
and which revelation is here treated of in the internal sense), was from the Divine in Himself, thus was from Himself. </p>

'And Joseph said to him, This is the interpretation of it' means revelation resulting from the perception received by the celestial within the natural as to what it held within it. This is clear from 
the meaning of 'saying' in the historical narratives of the Word as perception, dealt with in <a href="1791.htm">1791</a>, <a href="1815.htm">1815</a>, <a href="1819.htm">1819</a>, <a href="1822.htm">1822</a>, <a href="1898.htm">1898</a>, <a href="1919.htm">1919</a>, <a href="2080.htm">2080</a>, <a href="2619.htm">2619</a>, <a href="2862.htm">2862</a>, <a href="3509.htm">3509</a>, <a href="3395.htm">3395</a>, in this case as revelation resulting from 
perception, since the subject is a dream and its interpretation, and all revelation is either the result of talking to angels through whom the Lord speaks or else the result of perception, dealt with 
below; from the representation of 'Joseph' as the celestial within the natural, dealt with above in <a href="5086.htm">5086</a>, <a href="5087.htm">5087</a>, <a href="5106.htm">5106</a>; and from the meaning of 'the interpretation' as what it held within it, also dealt 
with above, in <a href="5093.htm">5093</a>, <a href="5105.htm">5105</a>, <a href="5107.htm">5107</a>. From this it is evident that 'Joseph said to him, This is the interpretation of it' means revelation resulting from the perception received by the celestial within 
the natural as to what it held within it. </p>

<p><b>[2]</b>
 With regard to revelations resulting either from perception or from talking to angels through whom the Lord speaks, it should be recognized that people 
who are governed by good and from this by truth, especially those who are governed by good flowing from love to the Lord, receive revelation as a result of perception. But those who are not governed 
by good or from this by truth can indeed receive revelations, but not those that are the result of perception, only those which come to them through a voice which they hear speaking within themselves 
and so through angels from the Lord. This kind of revelation is external, whereas the other kind is internal. Revelation resulting from perception is the kind that angels, especially celestial ones, 
receive. It was also the kind received by members of the Most Ancient Church, and by some members of the Ancient Church too; but scarcely anyone receives such at the present day. Very many people however, 
including those who have not been governed by good, have received revelations from conversations [with angels] which did not involve any perception, the same as with those receiving revelations through 
visions or through dreams. </p>
<p></p>
<p><b>[3]</b>
 Most of the revelations received by the prophets in the Jewish Church were of this kind - they heard a voice, saw a vision, or dreamed a dream. But because they 
had no perception these were merely verbal or visual revelations which did not involve any perception about what was really meant by them. For genuine perception comes from the Lord through heaven; 
it fills the understanding with spiritual ideas and leads it, as may be perceived, to think along the lines of, and inwardly to recognize, the true nature of a thing. The source of that power of recognition 
is not known, but the understanding imagines that it begins within itself and springs from the interconnected ideas it has present within itself. But in fact that power is a dictate coming from 
the Lord by way of heaven into the interior parts of ones thought regarding the things that are above and beyond the natural and the senses, that is, the kinds of things that belong to the spiritual 
world or heaven. From all this one may see what revelation resulting from perception is. But the revelation resulting from perception which the Lord, who is represented here by 'Joseph', had - which revelation 
is the subject here in the internal sense - sprang from the Divine within Himself, and so originated in Himself. </p>

`Et dixit illi Joseph, Haec interpretatio illius':  quod significet revelationem a perceptione a caelesti in naturali quid in se haberet, constat ex significatione `dicere' in historicis Verbi quod 
sit perceptio, de qua n. 1791,1815, 1822, 1898, 1919, 2080, 2619, 2862, 3509, (x)3395, hic revelatio ex perceptione quia de somnio et ejus interpretatione agitur; omnis revelatio vel est ex loquela 
cum angelis per quos Dominus loquitur, vel {1} ex perceptione, de qua re sequitur; ex repraesentatione `Josephi' quod sit caeleste in naturali, de qua supra n. 5086, 5087, 5106; et ex significatione 
`interpretationes quod sit quid in se haberet, de qua etiam supra n. 5093, 5105, 
5107; inde patet quod per 'dixit illi Joseph, Haec interpretio illius' 
significetur revelatio a perceptione a caelesti in naturali quid in se haberet.  
 </p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">[2] Quod revelationes sint vel ex perceptione, vel ex loquela cum angelis per quos Dominus loquitur, sciendum quod illi qui in bono sunt et inde 
in vero, imprimis qui in bono amoris in dominum, revelationem ex perceptione habeant; at qui non in bono et inde in vero sunt, quod quidem revelationes habere possint, sed non ex perceptione, verum 
per vivam vocem auditam in illis, ita per angelos a Domino; haec revelatio est externa, illa autem interna; revelationem ex perceptione, habent angeli imprimis caelestes, etiam habuerunt homines 
ab Antiquissima Ecclesia, et aliqui etiam ab Antiqua, sed hodie vix aliquis; at revelationes ex loquela absque perceptione habuerunt perplures, etiam qui non in bono fuerunt, pariter per visiones 
aut per somnia;</p>
<p>&nbsp;[3] tales revelationes fuerunt pleraeque prophetarum in Ecclesia Judaica; audiverunt vocem, viderunt {2}visionem, et somniarunt somnium; sed quia nullam perceptionem habuerunt, fuerunt 
revelationes mere verbales vel visuales absque perceptione quid significarent; </p>
<p>perceptio enim genuina existit {3} per caelum a Domino, et afficit intellectuale spiritualiter, et ducit id perceptibiliter 
ad cogitandum sicut res se habet, cum assensu interno quem nescit unde; putat quod insit ei, et quod fluat ex nexu rerum, at est dictamen {4} per caelum a Domino in interiora cogitationis influens, 
de talibus quae supra naturale et sensuale sunt, hoc est, de talibus quae spiritualis mundi seu caeli sunt; ex his constare potest quid revelatio ex perceptione sit.  At revelatio ex perceptione 
quae fuit Domino, Qui hic per `Josephum' repraesentatur et de qua hic in sensu interno agitur, fuit ex Divino in Ipso, ita ab Ipso.</p>
