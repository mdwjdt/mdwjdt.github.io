<h3 align="center" class="ired">属天的奥秘 第9914节</h3>
<h4 align="center"></h4><p><strong>9914.</strong>“领口的周围要有领边”表它在各处都有边界并被封闭。这从“领边”或边缘的含义清楚可知。外袍的领口或开口周围的“领边”或边缘是指在各处都有边界并被封闭；因为周围的这“领边”或边缘是用来给外袍形成边界并进行封闭的。此处和接下来的话描述了属天良善进入属灵良善的流注所取的路线。这流注发生的过程类似力从人的头部通过脖颈流入身体所取的路线，这从刚才关于对应的说明清楚看出来。<br />必须简要阐述一下这种流注的性质。属于头部，也就是说，属于大脑和小脑的一切首要事物在那里集结成纤维束和细小的神经，并且集结之后穿过脖颈进入身体，在身体里面朝各个方向发散，完全照始于脑的意愿的渴望而移动它的各个部位或器官。从属天国度（就是大人或天堂里的头）降至属灵国度（可以说是那里的身体）的能力和力的流注与这一切很相似。这种流注也是“中间为头留出的外袍领口”所表示和描述的。这就是为何“领口的领边”表示各处的边界和封闭。接下来描述的是这种边界本身。</p>

<p align="center"><b>Potts(1905-1910) 9914</b></p><p><b>9914.</b>
And there shall be a lip for the mouth of it round about. That this signifies that it is bounded and closed on every side, is evident from the signification of "a lip," or border, round about the mouth 
or upper opening of the robe, as being that which is bounded and closed on every side; for this "lip," or border, which was round about, bounded and closed the robe. By this and what presently follows 
is described the method of the influx of celestial good into spiritual good. That this influx takes place by a method like that with man of the influx of forces from the head through the neck, is 
evident from what was said in the foregoing article about correspondence. [2] What the nature of this influx is, shall also be briefly told. All the first things, that belong to the head, that is, to 
the cerebrum and cerebellum, are gathered together there into little bundles of fibers, and into little nerves, and after being gathered together they are passed down through the neck into the body, 
and are there diffused in all directions, and move the organs in complete compliance with the will, which begins in the brains. Similar also is the downflow and inflow of powers and forces from the celestial 
kingdom (which is the head in the Grand Man, that is, in heaven) into the spiritual kingdom (which is like the body there). This influx is also what is meant and described by "the mouth of the 
head of the robe in the midst," and its bounding termination by "the lip round about." It is for this reason that by "the lip of its mouth" is signified what is bounded and closed on every side. The 
bounding itself is now described. </p>

<p align="center"><b>Elliott(1983-1999) 9914</b></p><p><b>9914.</b>
'And its hole shall have a border round about' means that it is bounded and enclosed on every side. This is clear from the meaning of 'a border', or edging, around the hole or opening on the upper part 
of the robe, as being bounded and enclosed on every side; for that border or edging which went all round served to bound and enclose. The words here and those following immediately after describe the 
course which the inflow of celestial good into spiritual good takes. What is involved in this inflow is similar to the course taken by the forces flowing from a person's head through the neck into 
the body, as is clear from what has been stated regarding correspondence in the paragraph immediately above.  </p>
<p></p>
<p><b>[2]</b>
 The nature of this influx must also be stated briefly. All the chief things that belong 
to the head, that is to say, to the cerebrum and cerebellum, are assembled into bundles of fibres and tiny nerves there, and so assembled pass down through the neck into the body. Within the body 
they spread out in every direction and move its parts altogether as the will, which begins in the brain, desires. Similar to all this is the flow of powers and forces down from the celestial kingdom, 
which is the head in the Grand Man or heaven, into the spiritual kingdom, which is so to speak the body there. This inflowing is also what is meant and described by 'the robe's hole for the head in the 
middle', and the limits of it by 'a border round about'. This then is why a boundary and enclosure on every side is meant by 'the border' which that hole possessed. The actual boundary is described next.  </p>

`Et labrum erit ori ejus circumcirca': quod significet undequaque terminatum et clausum, constat ex significatione  `labri' (x)seu limbi circum os seu aperturam superiorem pallii, quod sit undequaque 
terminatum et clausum; labrum enim illud, seu limbus ille qui circumcirca, terminabat et claudebat.  Describitur per hoc et per mox sequentia ratio influxus boni  caelestis in bonum spirituale; quod 
influxus ille se habeat simili ratione qua influxus virium e capite per collum in corpus apud hominem, constat ex illis quae in superiore articulo de correspondentia dicta sunt. 	[2] Qualis hic influxus 
sit, paucis etiam dicetur: omnia prima quae capitis sunt, nempe quae cerebri et cerebelli, colligunt se in fasciculos fibrarum {1}et nervulos ibi, et collecta demittuntur per collum in corpus, (c)ac 
inibi se diffundunt undequaque, et movent organica ibi prorsus ad nutum voluntatis, quae incohat in cerebris; similis etiam defluxus et influxus potentiarum et virium {2}est e regno caelesti, quod 
est caput in Maximo Homine seu in caelo, in regnum spirituale, quod est sicut corpus ibi.  Ille etiam influxus est qui intelligitur et describitur per `os capitis pallii in medio,' et terminatio ejus 
per `labrum circumcirca'; inde nunc est quod per `labrum oris istius' significetur terminatum et clausum undequaque; ipsa terminatio nunc describitur. @1 seu nervos$ @2 Before defluxus$ </p>
