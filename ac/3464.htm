<h3 align="center" class="ired">属天的奥秘 第3464节</h3>
<h4 align="center"></h4><p><strong>3464.</strong>“将他们挖井的事告诉他，对他说，我们找到水了”表通过这些事物所获得的内层真理。这从“井”和“水”的含义清楚可知：“井”是指圣言（<a href="3424.htm">3424</a>节）；“水”是指真理（<a href="2702.htm">2702</a>节），也就是取自圣言的真理。因此“将他们挖井的事告诉他”表示涉及圣言，就是教义事物的源头；“对他说，我们找到水了”则表示内层真理就居于他们里面，也就是教义事物里面。因为如前所述，取自圣言字义的一切教义事物都含有内层真理在里面。圣言的字义就像一口有水之井，圣言的每一个事物里面都有一个内义，而内义也居于取自圣言的教义事物。<br />至于取自圣言字义的教义事物，情况是这样：当人拥有教义事物，同时照之生活时，他就拥有一种对应关系在里面。因为当他对外层真理有感觉时，与他同在的天使就对内层真理有感觉；他以这种方式通过教义事物与天堂交流，不过，这取决于其生活的良善。例如，他在领受圣餐时若通过“这是我的身体，这是我的血”这句话简单地思想主，那么与他同在的天使心里就会想到对主之爱和对邻之仁；因为对主之爱对应于主的身体和饼，而对邻之仁则对应于血和酒（<a href="1798.htm">1798</a>，<a href="2165.htm">2165</a>，<a href="2177.htm">2177</a>，<a href="2187.htm">2187</a>节）。这就是对应的性质，所以会有一种情感从天堂经由天使流入此人当时所处的神圣状态，他照其生活的良善接受这情感。<br />实际上，与每个人同在的天使就居于其生命的情感中，因而居于对他所照之生活的教义事物的情感中，从不居于与其生活不一致的教义事物中。若他的生活与教义事物不一致，如他的情感是利用教义事物为自己攫取荣耀和财富，那么在这种情况下，天使就会退离，地狱灵则居于这情感。这些地狱灵要么向他注入对教义事物的确认，以支持自我和这个世界，从而注入一种说服式的信仰，这种信仰具有这样的特点，只要能吸引人的注意力，他根本不在乎事情是真还是假；他们要么夺走一切信，在这种情况下，挂在他嘴上的教义不过是由这些爱欲之火所激起和调制的声音而已。</p>

And showed him concerning the well which they had digged; and they said, We have found waters. That this signifies interior truths by means of these things, is evident from the signification of a "well," 
as being the Word (n. 3424); and from the signification of "waters," as being truths (n. 2702), that is, truths which are from the Word; thus to "show him concerning the well which they had digged," 
signifies concerning the Word from which they had doctrinal things; "and they said, We have found waters," signifies that in them, that is, in the doctrinal things, there were interior truths. For 
as before said, there are interior truths in all the doctrinal things that are drawn from the literal sense of the Word, because the literal sense of the Word is like a well that contains water; for 
in each and every thing of the Word there is an internal sense, which is also in the doctrinal things that are from the Word.  [2] As regards the doctrinal things that are from the literal sense of the 
Word, the case is this: When a man is in them, and at the same time in a life according to them, he has a correspondence in himself; for the angels who are with him are in interior truths, while he 
is in exterior ones, and thus through the doctrinal things he has communication with heaven, but according to the good of his life. As for example, when in the Holy Supper he thinks in simplicity of 
the Lord from the words then used, "This is My body, and this is "My blood," the angels with him are in the idea of love to the Lord and charity toward the neighbor; for love to the Lord corresponds to 
the Lord's body, and to bread; and charity toward the neighbor corresponds to the blood, and the wine (n. 1798, 2165, 2177, 2187); and because there is such a correspondence, there flows an affection 
out of heaven through the angels into that holy state in which the man then is, which affection he receives in accordance with the good of his life. [3] For the angels dwell with everyone in his life's 
affection, thus in the affection of the doctrinal things according to which he lives; but in no case if his life disagrees therewith; for if the life disagrees, as for instance if he is in the affection 
of gaining honors and riches by means of doctrinal things, then the angels retire, and infernals dwell in this affection, who either infuse into him confirmations of the doctrinal things for the 
sake of self and the world, thus a persuasive faith-which is such that it is regardless whether a thing is true or false provided it captivates the minds of others-or else they take away all faith, 
and then the doctrine of his lips is only a sound excited and modified by the fire of these loves. </p>

<p align="center"><b>Elliott(1983-1999) 3464</b></p><p><b>3464.</b>
'And pointed out to him the reasons for the well which they had dug; and they said to him, We have found water' means interior truths obtained by means of these. This is clear from the meaning of 'a 
well' as the Word, dealt with in <a href="3424.htm">3424</a>, and from the meaning of 'water' as truths, dealt with in <a href="2702.htm">2702</a>, that is to say, truths drawn from the Word. 'Pointing out to him the reasons for the well which they 
had dug' accordingly means concerning the Word, the source of matters of doctrine; 'and they said to him, We have found water' means that it is in these, that is to say, in matters of doctrine, that 
interior truths reside; for as stated above, all matters of doctrine drawn from the literal sense of the Word include interior truths within them. For the literal sense of the Word is like a well with 
water in it, in that every single thing in the Word holds within itself the internal sense, which resides also in matters of doctrine drawn from the Word. </p>
<p></p>
<p><b>[2]</b>
 The situation with matters of doctrine 
drawn from the literal sense of the Word is that when anyone possesses them and at the same time lives according to them a correspondence exists within himself. For the angels who reside with him 
are alive to the interior truths when he is alive to the exterior; and in this way he has communication with heaven by means of matters of doctrine, though this is conditioned by how good a life he leads. 
For example, when at the Holy Supper this person in simplicity thinks about the Lord from the words 'This is My body' and 'This is My blood' the angels residing with him have in mind love to the 
Lord and charity towards the neighbour; for love to the Lord corresponds to the Lord's body and to the bread, while charity towards the neighbour corresponds to His blood and to the wine, <a href="1798.htm">1798</a>, <a href="2165.htm">2165</a>, <a href="2177.htm">2177</a>, <a href="2187.htm">2187</a>. This being the nature of the correspondence, there flows from heaven by way of the angels into that holiness present with the person at that time an affection which he receives according to 
the good within his life. </p>
<p></p>
<p><b>[3]</b>
 Actually angels dwell with every person in the affection that belongs to his life, and so in the affection for the matters of doctrine according to which he lives, but 
never in the matters of doctrine with which his life is at variance. If his life is at variance with them, as it is if his affection is to gain position and wealth for himself by means of matters of 
doctrine, the angels in that case depart and spirits from hell dwell in that affection. These either instill their confirmations into him that favour self and the world - thus a false persuasion, which 
is such that he does not care at all whether a thing is true or false, provided people's attention is drawn to himself - or they take away all faith, in which case the doctrine on that person's lips 
is merely a sound prompted and fashioned by the fire of those loves. </p>

`Et indicaverunt ei super causas putei quem foderunt, et dixerunt ei, Invenimus aquas': quod significet vera interiora per illa, constat ex significatione `putei' quod sit Verbum, de qua n. 3424; et 
ex significatione `aquarum' quod sint vera, de qua n. 2702, nempe quae ex Verbo; ita `indicare ei super causas putei quem foderunt' significat de Verbo ex quo doctrinalia, et `dixerunt ei, Invenimus 
aquas' significat quod in illis, {1}nempe in doctrinalibus, vera interiora; sunt enim, ut supra dictum, in omnibus doctrinalibus ex Verbi sensu litterali desumptis, vera interiora; Verbi enim sensus litteralis 
est sicut puteus in quo aqua, nam in omnibus et singulis Verbi est sensus internus, qui quoque est in doctrinalibus quae ex Verbo: [2] ita se habet cum doctrinalibus quae ex sensu litterali 
Verbi, quod cum homo in illis est et simul in vita secundum illa, in se habeat correspondentiam; angeli enim qui apud illum, in veris interioribus sunt cum is in exterioribus, ita {2}habet communicationem 
per doctrinalia cum caelo, sed secundum {3}suae vitae bonum: ut pro exemplo, cum in Sacra Cena simpliciter cogitat de Domino, ex verbis ibi,           Hoc est corpus Meum et hic est sanguis Meus; </p>
<p>tunc 
angeli apud illum sunt in idea amoris in Dominum et charitatis erga proximum, nam corpori Domini et pani correspondet amor in Dominum, ac sanguini et vino correspondet charitas erga proximum, 
n. 1798, 2165, 2177, 2187, et quia talis est correspondentia, e caelo per angelos influit in illud sanctum in quo tunc est homo, {4}affectio, quam secundum vitae suae bonum recipit; [3] angeli enim habitant 
apud unumquemvis in ejus vitae affectione, ita in doctrinalium secundum quae vivit, nusquam {5}a quibus vita discrepat; si vita discrepat, ut si sit in affectione lucrandi honores et opes per doctrinalia, 
tunc recedunt angeli, et in affectione illa habitant infernales, qui vel infundunt ei confirmationes illorum sui et mundi causa, ita fidem persuasivam, quae talis est ut nihil curet num verum 
sit vel falsum modo captent animos, vel omnem fidem auferunt, et tunc doctrina oris ejus est modo sonus ab igne amorum istorum excitatus et modificatus. @1 vera, hic vera interiora nempe in doctrinalibus$ 
 @2 after caelo$  @3 ejus$  @4 after influit$  @5 i in ejus doctrinalibus$  </p>
