<h3 align="center" class="ired">属天的奥秘 第9360节</h3>
<h4 align="center"></h4><p><strong>9360.</strong>除了已经介绍的原因外，还需要补充的是，在大人里面，我们地球的居民、灵人和天使都与外在或肉体感知有关（参看<a href="9107.htm">9107</a>节）；外在或或肉体感知是最低层，生命的内层事物都终结于最低层，并止于其上上如同止于它们的共有容器（<a href="5077.htm">5077</a>，<a href="9212.htm">9212</a>，<a href="9216.htm">9216</a>节）。这同样适用于文字上的神之真理，它被称为“圣言”，也是为了这个原因而被赐给这个星球而非别的星球。此外，由于主就是圣言，是其首先的和末后的，所以为叫一切事都能照真正的秩序发生，祂的旨意就是祂要在这个星球出生，并变成圣言，正如约翰福音中的这些话：<br />太初有圣言，圣言与神同在，圣言就是神。这圣言太初与神同在。万物是藉着祂造的；凡被造的，没有一样不是藉着祂造的。圣言成了肉身，住在我们中间，我们也见过祂的荣光，正是父独生子的荣光。从来没有人看见神，只有在父怀里的独生子将祂表明出来。（约翰福音<a href="http://39-27.cn/约1.1.htm">1:1</a>-<a href="http://39-27.cn/约1.4.htm">4</a>，<a href="http://39-27.cn/约1.14.htm">14</a>，<a href="http://39-27.cn/约1.18.htm">18</a>）<br />“圣言”是指神性真理。不过，这是一个只有少数人能明白的奥秘。</p>

To the reasons already adduced may be added that the inhabitants, spirits, and angels of our earth bear relation in the Grand Man to the external and bodily sense (see n. 9107), and the external and 
bodily sense is the ultimate, into which the interior things of life come to a close, and in which they rest as in their common receptacle (n. 5077, 9212,  9216). The case is similar with truth Divine 
in the letter, which is called "the Word," and which for this reason also has been given on this earth and not on another. And because the Lord is the Word, and is its first and its last, therefore in 
order that all things might come forth according to order, He also willed to be born on this earth, and to become the Word; according to these words in John: </p>
<p>     In the beginning was the Word, and 
the Word was with God, and God was the Word. The same was in the beginning with God. All thing were made by Him; and without Him was not anything made that was made. And the Word was made flesh, and 
dwelt among us, and we saw His glory, the glory as of the Only-begotten of the Father. No man hath seen God at any time; the Only-begotten Son, who is in the bosom of the Father, He hath set Him forth 
(John 1:1-3, 14, 18); </p>
<p>"the Word" denotes the Divine truth. But this is a secret which will fall into the understanding of only a few. </p>

In addition to the reasons already introduced there is the consideration that the inhabitants, spirits, and angels belonging to our planet correlate in the Grand Man with external or bodily perceiving, <a href="9107.htm">9107</a>, and external or bodily perceiving is the lowest level, in which more internal levels of life terminate and on which they rest as their general foundation, <a href="5077.htm">5077</a>, <a href="9212.htm">9212</a>, <a href="9216.htm">9216</a>. The same applies to 
God's truth in its literal form, which is called the Word; it has been provided for a like reason on this planet and not on another. Furthermore, since the Lord is the Word, since He is its first and 
last, His will was that He should be born and become the Word on this planet, in order that everything might take place in keeping with true order, according to the following words in John,  </p>
<blockquote>
In the 
beginning was the Word, and the Word was with God, and the Word was God. He was in the beginning with God. All things were made by Him, and without Him was not anything made that was made. And the 
Word became flesh and dwelt among us; and we saw His glory, glory as of the Only Begotten from the Father. Nobody has ever seen God; the only begotten Son who is in the bosom of the Father, He has made 
Him known. <a href="http://bible.gospelcom.net/cgi-bin/bible?passage=John%201:1-3,%2014,%2018&amp;version=ESV&amp;interface=print&amp;showfn=yes&amp;showxref">John 1:1-3, 14, 18</a>.  
</blockquote>
<p>'The Word' is Divine Truth. But this is an arcanum about which only few can have any understanding.  </p>

Ad causas quae prius allatae sunt, accedit quod incolae, spiritus, et angeli nostrae telluris referant in Maximo Homine sensum externum et corporeum, n. 9107; ac sensus externus et corporeus est ultimum, 
in quod desinunt interiora vitae, et in quo, ut in suo communi, requiescunt, n. 5077, 9212, 9216; simile est verum Divinum in littera, quod vocatur Verbum, quod ob illam causam etiam in hac tellure 
et non in alia datum est; et quia Dominus est Verbum, et ejus primum et ultimum, ut omnia secundum ordinem existerent, etiam ideo voluit in hac tellure nasci et fieri Verbum, secundum haec apud Johannem, 	In 
principio erat Verbum, et Verbum erat apud Deum, et Deus erat Verbum; hoc erat in principio apud Deum; omnia per Ipsum facta sunt, et sine Ipso factum est nihil quod factum est.  Et Verbum 
caro factum est, et habitavit inter nos, et vidimus gloriam Ipsius, gloriam ut Unigeniti a Patre.  Deum nemo vidit usquam; Unigenitus Filius, Qui in sinu Patris est, Ipse exposuit, i (x)1-3 , 14, 18; </p>
<p>`Verbum' 
est Divinum Verum.  Sed hoc arcanum est quod in intellectum modo pauciorum cadit {1}. @1 cadere potest$ </p>
