<h3 align="center" class="ired">属天的奥秘 第8546节</h3>
<h4 align="center"></h4><p><strong>8546.</strong>还有一次，我与木星灵谈论主。我说，没有人能从自己行任何善事，只能从主，主是良善本身，因而是一切良善的源泉。他们谦逊地回答说，他们认为，他们以为自己能凭自己行善，不知道有什么不同。但当他们被指示，一切良善唯独来自主时，他们说，他们以平常的方式说话，而我是以天堂的方式说这事的；他们的天使也以这样的方式思考，和他们自己一样，以至于他们变成天使。他们补充说，用这种平常的方式说话更简单。我被允许回答他们说，主允许那些过着简单、纯真生活的人这样做，只要他们知道，没有一丝良善来自他们自己，一切良善皆来自主。</p>

Once also I talked with the spirits of the earth Jupiter about the Lord, saying that no one can do any good from himself, but from the Lord, who is Good itself, consequently the fountain of all good. 
They then modestly replied that they suppose they can do good of themselves, and do not know otherwise. But when it was shown them that all good comes solely from the Lord, they said that they spoke 
after the human manner, and that this was said in a heavenly manner, and that their angels so think, and they themselves also, insofar as they become angels. They added that it is simpler to speak in 
that way. It was then given to reply that the Lord allows those who live in simplicity and innocence so to speak, provided they know that nothing of good comes from themselves, but all from the Lord. </p>

On one other occasion I talked to spirits belonging to the planet Jupiter about the Lord. I said that no one can do anything good from himself, only from the Lord, who is Goodness itself and therefore 
the fountain of all good. They replied in an unassuming way that they suppose they can do good from themselves; they do not know anything different. But when they were shown that all good comes solely 
from the Lord, they said that they had spoken in an ordinary way, whereas I had stated the matter in a heavenly manner, and that their angels think in the same manner, as they themselves do also to 
the extent that they become angels. They added that it is simpler to speak in that ordinary way. I was allowed to answer them that the Lord leaves those who lead simple and innocent lives to do so, provided 
that they know that no good at all comes from themselves, only from the Lord </p>

Cum spiritibus telluris Jovis quondam etiam locutus sum de Domino, dicendo quod nemo aliquod bonum facere possit a se, sed a Domino Qui est ipsum Bonum, (d){1}proinde fons omnis boni; tunc modeste respondebant 
quod autument {2} bonum posse facere ex se, nec aliter scire; sed cum illis {3} ostensum est quod omne bonum veniat unice a Domino, dicebant quod illi humano more locuti sint, et quod (c)illud 
{4} caelesti modo dictum, et quod illorum angeli ita cogitent, et {5}quoque ipsi quantum (t)angeli fiunt; adjiciebant quod simplicius sit ita dicere; tunc respondere datum est quod Dominus relinquat 
illis qui in simplicitate et innocentia vivunt, ita dicere, modo sciant quod nihil boni ab ipsis sed a Domino veniat. 	@1 et inde$ 	@2 i se$ 	@3 i tunc$ 	@4 i et$ 	@5 illi quoque$ </p>
