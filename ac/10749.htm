The life of man cannot be changed after death. It then remains such as it had been. Nor can the life of hell be transferred into the life of heaven, because they are opposites. From this it is evident 
that those who come into hell remain there forever; and that those who come into heaven remain there forever.            EXODUS 36 </p>
<p>     1. And Bezalel and Aholiab wrought, and every man wise in 
heart, in whom Jehovah put wisdom and intelligence to know how to do all the work of the ministry of the Holy, according to all that Jehovah commanded.      2. And Moses called unto Bezalel and unto 
Aholiab, and unto every man wise in heart, to whom Jehovah gave wisdom in his heart, everyone whom his heart impelled to draw near unto the work to do it.      3. And they took from before Moses all 
the offering which the sons of Israel brought for the work of the ministry of the Holy, to make it. And they brought yet unto him a freewill offering morning by morning.      4. And all the wise men, 
that wrought all the work of the Holy, brought, man by man from his work which they wrought; </p>
<p>     5. And they spoke unto Moses, saying, The people multiply to bring more than enough for the ministry 
of the work, which Jehovah commanded to do it.      6. And Moses commanded, and they proclaimed a voice in the camp, saying, Let neither man nor woman do any more work for the offering of the Holy; 
and he restrained the people from bringing.      7. And the work was sufficient for all the work to do it, and there was left over.      8. And every man wise in heart with them that wrought the work, 
made the Habitation with ten curtains; of fine twined linen, and blue, and crimson, and scarlet double-dyed, and cherubs, the work of a thinker he made them.      9. The length of one curtain was 
eight and twenty cubits, and the breadth four cubits, of one curtain; one measure for all the curtains.      10. And he joined five curtains together, one to one; and five curtains he joined together, 
one to one.      11. And he made loops of blue upon the edge of the one curtain from the end in the conjoining, so he made in the edge of the outermost curtain in the second conjoining.      12. 
Fifty loops made he in the one curtain, and fifty loops made he in the end of the curtain that was in the second conjoining; the loops were catching hold, one to one.      13. And he made fifty clasps 
of gold, and joined the curtains together one to one in the clasps; and it was one Habitation.      14. And he made curtains of goats' [hair] for a Tent over the Habitation; eleven curtains he made 
them.      15. The length of one curtain was thirty cubits, and the breadth four cubits, of one curtain; one measure for the eleven curtains.      16. And he joined together five curtains only, and 
six curtains only.      17. And he made fifty loops upon the edge of the outermost curtain in the conjoining, and fifty loops made he upon the edge of the curtain of the second conjoining.      18. 
And he made fifty clasps of brass to join the Tent together, to be one.      19. And he made a covering for the Tent of skins of red rams, and a covering of badgers'* skins above.      20. And he made 
the planks for the Habitation of shittim wood, standing up.      21. Ten cubits the length of a plank, and a cubit and half a cubit the breadth of one plank.      22. Two hands in one plank connected 
one to one; thus did he make for all the planks of the Habitation.      23. And he made the planks for the Habitation twenty planks for the corner of the south southward; </p>
<p>     24. And he made 
forty bases of silver under the twenty planks; two bases under one plank for its two hands, and two bases under one plank for its two hands.      25. And for the other side of the Habitation, at the 
corner of the north, he made twenty planks.      26. And their forty bases of silver; two bases under one plank, and two bases under one plank.      27. And for the legs of the Habitation toward the 
sea [westward] he made six planks.      28. And two planks made he for the corners of the Habitation in the legs.      29. And they were twinned from beneath, and they were together entire at the head 
of it unto one ring; thus did he for these two, for the two corners.      30. And there were eight planks, and their bases of silver, sixteen bases; two bases under one plank.      31. And he made 
five bars of shittim wood for the planks of the first side of the Habitation.      32. And five bars for the planks of the other side of the Habitation, and five bars for the planks of the Habitation, 
for the legs toward the sea.      33. And he made the middle bar to pass through in the middle of the planks, from end to end.      34. And he overlaid the planks with gold, and made their rings 
of gold, receptacles for the bars, and he overlaid the bars with gold.      35. And he made the veil of blue, and crimson, and scarlet double-dyed, and fine twined linen; with the work of a thinker 
he made it with cherubs.      36. And he made for it four pillars of shittim wood, and overlaid them with gold, their hooks of gold; and he cast for them four bases of silver.      37. And he made 
a covering for the door of the Tent, of blue, and crimson, and scarlet double-dyed, and fine twined linen, with the work of the embroiderer.      38. And the five pillars of it, and their hooks; and 
he overlaid their heads and their fillets with gold; and their five bases of brass. * Latin, pelles melium. "Badgers" is the usual rendering of meles. But in Adversaria, Exodus, n. 1297, Swedenborg says 
that these meles are mares haedorum, "the males of kids," which would agree with what is here said of them. It is difficult to believe that a badger has a higher signification than a ram. [REVISER.] </p>

A person's life cannot be changed after death; it then remains the same as what it had been before. Nor can the life of hell be transformed into the life of heaven, because they are opposites. From this 
it is evident that those who enter hell remain there forever, and those who enter heaven remain there forever.  </p>

<p>CAPUT XXXVI </p>
<p>	1.  Et fecit Bezaleel et Aholiab, et omnis vir sapiens corde, in quibus dedit JEHOVAH sapientiam et intelligentiam ad 
sciendum facere omne opus ministerii sancti, quoad omne quod praecepit JEHOVAH. 	2.  Et vocavit Moscheh ad Bezaleelem et ad Aholiabum, et ad omnem virum sapientem corde, cui dedit JEHOVAH sapientiam 
in corde ejus, omnem quem impulit cor ejus ad accedendum ad opus ad faciendum illud. 	3.  Et acceperunt a coram Mosche omnem sublationem quam adduxerunt filii Israelis ad opus ministerii sancti ad faciendum 
illud; et illi adduxerunt ad illum adhuc spontaneum in mane in mane. 	4.  Et adduxerunt omnes sapientes facientes omne opus sancti, vir vir ex opere suo, quod illi facientes. 	5.  Et dixerunt 
ad Moschen, dicendo, Multiplicant populus ad adducendum prae sufficientia ministerii ad opus quod praecepit JEHOVAH ad faciendum illud. 	6.  Et praecepit Moscheh, et promulgarunt vocem in castris, 
dicendo, Vir et mulier ne faciant amplius opus ad sublationem sancti, et cohibuit populum ab adducendo. 	7.  Et opus fuit sufficiens omni operi ad faciendum illud, et superfluum erat. 	8.  Et fecerunt 
omnis sapiens corde cum facientibus opus, habitaculum decem aulaeis, byssino intertexto, et hyacinthino, et purpura, et coccineo dibapho; et cherubos opus excogitatoris fecit illos. 	9.  Longitudo 
aulaei unius octo et viginti in cubito, et latitudo quattuor in cubito, aulaei unius; mensura una omnibus aulaeis. 	10.  Et conjunxit quinque aulaea, unum ad unum; et quinque aulaea conjunxit unum 
ad unum. 	11.  Et fecit loramenta hyacinthino super ora aulaei unius a fine in conjunctione, ita fecit in ora aulaei extremi in conjunctione altera. 	12.  Quinquaginta loramenta fecit in aulaeo uno, 
et quinquaginta loramenta fecit in fine aulaei quod in conjunctione altera, suscipientia se loramenta unum ad unum. 	13.  Et fecit quinquaginta ansulas auri, et conjunxit aulaea unum ad unum in ansulis, 
et fuit habitaculum unum. 	14. Et fecit aulaea caprarum tentorio super habitaculo, undecim aulaea fecit ea. 	15.  Longitudo aulaei unius triginta in cubito, et quattuor cubiti latitudo aulaei unius, 
mensura una undecim aulaeis. 	16.  Et conjunxit quinque aulaea solum, et sex aulaea solum. 	17.  Et fecit loramenta quinquaginta super ora aulaei extremi in conjunctione, et quinquaginta loramenta

dibapho, et byssino intertexto, opere acupictoris. 	38.  Et columnas ejus quinque, et uncos illarum, et obduxit capita illarum et fascias illarum auro; et bases earum quinque aere. </p>
