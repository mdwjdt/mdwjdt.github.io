<h3 align="center" class="ired">属天的奥秘 第4831节</h3>
<h4 align="center"></h4><p><strong>4831.</strong>“名叫他玛”表该教会的性质，即它是一个代表属灵和属天事物的教会。这从“名”的含义清楚可知，“名”是指性质（<a href="144.htm">144</a>，<a href="145.htm">145</a>，<a href="1754.htm">1754</a>，<a href="1896.htm">1896</a>，<a href="2009.htm">2009</a>，<a href="2724.htm">2724</a>，<a href="3006.htm">3006</a>，<a href="3421.htm">3421</a>节），在此是指该教会的性质，因为在本章，他玛代表这个教会，事实上代表将要建立在犹大后代当中、代表属灵和属天事物的教会。他玛便代表这个教会，这一点从下文明显看出来。这一整章在内义上论述了犹太教会，以及它如何像古教会那样成为主国度的属灵和属天事物的代表；而且不仅在外在形式上，还在内在形式上变成代表。因为教会不是凭它的外在，也就是宗教仪式，而是凭它的内在而为教会；因为内在是本质，而外在只是表达本质的形式。雅各的后代是那种不愿接受内在事物的人；所以，古教会无法在他们当中被兴起，只能在他们当中兴起该教会的一个代表（<a href="4307.htm">4307</a>，<a href="4444.htm">4444</a>，<a href="4500.htm">4500</a>节）。他玛在此表示这个教会的内在，“犹大”与他的迦南妻子所生的三个儿子表示这个教会的外在。</p>

And her name was Tamar. That this signifies the quality of the church, that it was a church representative of spiritual and celestial things, is evident from the signification of "name," as being the 
quality (n. 144, 145, 1754, 1896, 2009, 2724, 3006, 3421), here the quality of the church, because in this chapter by Tamar is represented the church, and indeed a church representative of spiritual 
and celestial things which was to be instituted among the posterity of Judah. That this church is represented by Tamar, is evident from what follows. This entire chapter in the internal sense treats of 
the Jewish Church, that it should become representative of the spiritual and celestial things of the Lord's kingdom, as had been the Ancient Church; and this not only in external, but also in internal 
form. For the church is not a church from externals, that is, from rituals, but from internals, which are essential, while externals are only formal. The posterity of Jacob were such as not to be willing 
to receive internal things; therefore with them the Ancient Church could not be renewed, but only a representative of that Church (n. 4307, 4444, 4500). The internal of the church here is Tamar, 
and its external is Judah with his three sons by the Canaanite woman. </p>

'And her name was Tamar' means the essential nature of the Church - a Church representative of spiritual and celestial things. This is clear from the meaning of 'name' as the essential nature, dealt 
with in <a href="144.htm">144</a>, <a href="145.htm">145</a>, <a href="1754.htm">1754</a>, <a href="1896.htm">1896</a>, <a href="2009.htm">2009</a>, <a href="2724.htm">2724</a>, <a href="3006.htm">3006</a>, <a href="3421.htm">3421</a>, in this case the essential nature of the Church because Tamar in this chapter represents the Church, in particular the Church representative of spiritual 
and celestial things which was to be established among the descendants of Judah. Tamar's representation of that Church is evident from what follows. This whole chapter deals in the internal sense 
with the Jewish Church, with how it was intended to become a Church representative of the spiritual and celestial things of the Lord's kingdom, as the Ancient Church had been, and to become such not 
only in external form but also in internal. For a Church is not a Church by virtue of its externals, that is, of its religious observances, but by virtue of its internals; for these are the essential 
realities, the externals merely forms expressing those realities. But the descendants of Jacob were the kind of people who had no wish to receive internal things. Among them therefore the Ancient Church 
could not be raised up, only that which was a representative of that Church, <a href="4307.htm">4307</a>, <a href="4444.htm">4444</a>, <a href="4500.htm">4500</a>. The internal dimension of the Church is meant here by 'Tamar', and the external by 'Judah' together 
with his three sons by his Canaanite wife. </p>

`Et nomen illius Tamar': quod significet quale Ecclesiae quod Ecclesia repraesentativa spiritualium et caelestium, constat ex significatione `nominis' quod sit quale, de qua n. 144, 145, 1754, 1896, 
2009, 2724, 3006, 3421, hic quale Ecclesiae quia per Tamarem in hoc capite repraesentatur Ecclesia, et quidem Ecclesia repraesentativa spiritualium et caelestium quae apud posteritatem Jehudae instituenda 
esset; quod per `Tamarem' illa Ecclesia repraesentetur, patet a sequentibus.  Agitur in toto hoc capite in sensu interno de Ecclesia Judaica quod fieret repraesentativa spiritualium et caelestium 
regni Domini sicut Ecclesia Antiqua, et hoc non solum in externa forma sed etiam in interna; Ecclesia enim non est Ecclesia ab externis, hoc est, a spiritualibus, sed ab internis, nam haec 
sunt essentialia, illa solum formalia; verum posteritas Jacobi talis fuit ut non vellet recipere interna; ideo apud illam non excitari potuit Ecclesia Antiqua, sed solum repraesentativum illius Ecclesiae, 
n. 4307, 4444, 4500; internum Ecclesiae hic est `Tamar', et externum (o)hic est `Jehudah' cum tribus filiis ex muliere Canaanitide. </p>
