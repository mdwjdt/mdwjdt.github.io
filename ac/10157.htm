<h3 align="center" class="ired">属天的奥秘 第10157节</h3>
<h4 align="center"></h4><p><strong>10157</strong>.“为要住在他们中间”表主的神性，这神性是天堂和教会全部中的全部。这从“住在以色列人中间”的含义清楚可知，“住在以色列人中间”当论及耶和华时，是指在天堂和教会中，主的同在，以及祂经由良善而来的流注（参看<a href="10153.htm">10153</a>节）。由于所表示的是祂在那里的同在，故所表示的也是祂的神性是那里全部中的部分，因为主与天堂天使和教会成员并不同在于他们自己的东西里面，而是与他们同在于祂自己的东西里面，因而同在于神性之物中，如前所示（<a href="10151.htm">10151</a>节）。当在天堂和教会，主存在于他自己的神性之物里面时，祂也是那里全部中的全部。因此，祂是天堂本身；这也解释了为何整个天堂呈现一个主在其神性人身方面的形像；又为何天堂整体上就是一个人，被称为大人（许多章节末尾论述了大人，参看<a href="9276.htm">9276</a>e节和<a href="10030.htm">10030</a>e节提到的地方）。这还解释了为何在圣言中，“人”表示教会，也表示天堂（<a href="478.htm">478</a>，<a href="768.htm">768</a>，<a href="3636.htm">3636</a>节），又为何那些在天堂里的人和那些真正在教会里的人可以说“在主里面”（<a href="3637.htm">3637</a>，<a href="3638.htm">3638</a>节），因为他们处于从主所获得的对主之爱的良善和对主之信的真理。</p>

That I may dwell in the midst of them. That this signifies the Divine of the Lord, that it is the all in all of heaven and the church, is evident from the signification of "dwelling in the midst of the 
sons of Israel," when said of Jehovah, as being the presence of the Lord, and His influx through good in heaven and in the church (see n. 10153); and as His presence is there, His Divine is likewise 
the all in all there, for the Lord is not present with the angels of heaven, and with the men of the church, in their own; but in His own with them, thus in what is Divine, according to what was shown 
above (n. 10151). And when the Lord is present in His own Divine in the heavens and in the church, He is likewise all in all there; hence He is heaven itself; and hence also it is that the whole heaven 
bears relation to the Lord, in respect to His Divine Human; and that heaven in the complex is a man, which is called the Grand Man (of which much has been said at the end of many chapters, see the 
places cited in n. 9276, end, 10030, end); and hence also it is that by "man" in the Word is signified the church, and likewise heaven (n. 478, 768, 3636); and that those who are in heaven, and truly 
in the church, are said to be "in the Lord" (n. 3637, 3638) when they are in the good of love and in the truth of faith to Him from Him. </p>

'That I may dwell in their midst' means what is Divine and the Lord's, which is the All in all of heaven and of the Church. This is clear from the meaning of 'dwelling in the midst of the children of 
Israel', when it refers to Jehovah, as the Lord's presence and His influx through good in heaven and in the Church, dealt with in <a href="10153.htm">10153</a>. And since His presence there is meant, what is Divine and His, 
the All in all there, is also meant. For the Lord is present with the angels of heaven and with members of the Church not in what is their own but in what is His with them, thus in what is Divine, as 
accords with what has been shown above in <a href="10151.htm">10151</a>; and when the Lord is present in what is Divine and His in the heavens and in the Church He is also the All in all there. Therefore He constitutes heaven 
itself, which also explains why the whole of heaven presents an image of the Lord as to His Divine Human, and why heaven in its entirety is a human being, called the Grand Man, a subject dealt with 
at the ends of a number of chapters, see the places referred to in <a href="9276.htm">9276</a>(end), <a href="10030.htm">10030</a>(end). It also explains why 'man' (homo) in the Word means the Church and also heaven, <a href="478.htm">478</a>, <a href="768.htm">768</a>, <a href="3636.htm">3636</a>, and why those 
who are in heaven, and those who are truly in the Church, are said to be 'in the Lord', <a href="3637.htm">3637</a>, <a href="3638.htm">3638</a>, since the good of love to and the truth of faith in the Lord, received from the Lord, are present in them.  </p>

`Ad habitandum Me in medio eorum': quod significet Divinum Domini, quod omne in omnibus caeli et Ecclesiae, constat ex significatione `habitare in medio filiorum Israelis' cum de Jehovah, {1} quod sit 
praesentia Domini, et influxus Ipsius per bonum in caelo et in Ecclesia, de qua n. 10,153; et quia est praesentia {2} Ipsius ibi, est quoque Divinum Ipsius omne in omnibus ibi, nam Dominus est praesens 
apud angelos caeli et apud homines Ecclesiae non in illorum proprio, sed in Suo apud illos, ita in Divino, secundum illa quae supra n. 10,151 ostensa sunt, et cum Dominus est praesens in Suo Divino 
in caelis {3} et in Ecclesia, est quoque omne in omnibus ibi; inde {4} est ipsum caelum, (o)et quoque inde est quod totum caelum referat Dominum quoad Divinum Humanum Ipsius; et quod caelum in complexu 
sit homo, qui Maximus Homo vocatur, de quo ad finem plurium capitum actum est, videantur citata n. 9276 (o)fin., 10,030 fin.; et inde quoque est quod per `hominem' in Verbo significetur Ecclesia 
et quoque caelum, n. 478, 768, 3636, et quod illi qui in caelo sunt, et vere in Ecclesia, dicantur in Domino esse, n. 3637, 3638, cum in bono amoris et in vero fidei in Ipsum ab Ipso. @1 i hoc est, Domino,$ @2
