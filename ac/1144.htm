<h3 align="center" class="ired">属天的奥秘 第1144节</h3>
<h4 align="center"></h4><p><strong>1144.</strong>创世记10:1.以下这些是挪亚的儿子闪、含、雅弗的后代；洪水以后，他们都生了儿子。<br />“以下这些是挪亚的儿子的后代”表古教会的教义和敬拜的衍生物，古教会一般是“挪亚”。“闪、含、雅弗”和前面一样：“闪”表真正的内在敬拜，“含”表败坏的内在敬拜，“雅弗”表与内在相应的外在敬拜。“他们都生了儿子”表源于这三者的教义。“洪水以后”表自这个新教会兴起之时。</p>

<p><strong>[NCE]1144.</strong> <a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_1144/bible_king-james-version_genesis_10_1" target=_top>Genesis 10:1</a>. And these are the births of Noah's sons: Shem, Ham, and Japheth; and sons were born to them after the flood.<br />These are births of Noah's sons symbolizes the doctrinal matters and types of worship that developed in the ancient church, which in general is Noah. Shem, Ham, and Japheth, have the same symbolism as before; Shem symbolizes true inner worship, Ham symbolizes inner worship corrupted, and Japheth symbolizes outer worship corresponding to inner. And sons were born to them symbolizes the doctrinal matters that developed out of their worship. After the flood means from the time when this new religion came into existence. </p>
<p align="center"><b>Potts(1905-1910) 1144</b></p><p><b>1144.</b>
Verse 1. And these are the nativities of the sons of Noah: Shem, Ham, and Japheth; and unto them were sons born after the flood. "These are the nativities of the sons of Noah," signifies derivations 
of the doctrinals and worships of the Ancient Church, which in general is "Noah;" "Shem, Ham, and Japheth" signify here as before-"Shem" true internal worship, "Ham" internal worship corrupted, and "Japheth" 
external worship corresponding to internal; "and unto them were sons born" signifies doctrinals derived therefrom; "after the flood," signifies from the time when this new church arose. </p>

<p align="center"><b>Elliott(1983-1999) 1144</b></p><p><b>1144.</b>
Verse 1 And these are the generations of the sons of Noah - Shem, Ham, and Japheth; and sons were born to them after the Flood. 'These are the generations of the sons of Noah' means derivative matters 
of doctrine and derivative forms of worship in the Ancient Church, which in general is Noah. 'Shem, Ham, and Japheth' have the same meaning here as previously -'Shem' true internal worship, 'Ham' corrupted 
internal worship, 'Japheth' external worship corresponding to internal. 'And sons were born to them' means matters of doctrine deriving from those three. 'After the Flood' means from the time 
when this new Church emerged. </p>

Vers. 1.  Et hae nativitates filiorum Noahi, Shem, Ham, et Japheth; et nati sunt illis filii post diluvium.  'Hae nativitates filiorum Noahi' significant derivationes doctrinalium et cultuum Antiquae 
Ecclesiae quae in genere est Noahus:  'Shem, Ham, et Japheth' significant hic ut prius; 'Shem' cultum internum verum; 'Ham' cultum internum corruptum; 'Japheth' cultum externum correspondentem interno: 
 'et nati sunt illis filii' significant derivata inde doctrinalia:  'post diluvium' significat a tempore quo nova haec Ecclesia exstitit. </p>
