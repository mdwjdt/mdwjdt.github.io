<h3 align="center" class="ired">属天的奥秘 第205节</h3>
<h4 align="center"></h4><p><strong>205.</strong>每节经文皆寓含教会的某个状态或状态的变化，此前，他们虽倾向自我，却能觉察其非，当下，他们开始犹疑不定——或许他们能凭自己判断先祖所言是否真实，眼睛就能打开。最后，因我欲的驱使，他们开始认为自己可以引导自己，因而如主一般。这正是我欲的本质，它不愿顺从主的引导，情愿自我引导，以感官和知识来检视信仰。</p>

Cooper(2008,2013)</b></p>
<p><strong>[NCE]205.</strong> Every verse holds inside it some particular state or change of state within the church. The first few verses spoke of a perception remaining among them that [this self-direction] was unacceptable even though they yearned for it. The present verses speak of a creeping uncertainty about whether it might actually be permissible, because it would allow them to see whether the things they had heard from their elders were true, and their eyes would be opened.<br />In the end, because self-love began to predominate in them, the text speaks of a state in which they could lead themselves and so resemble the Lord. Self-love carries with it the desire not to be led by the Lord but by oneself and, being led by oneself, to turn to sensory evidence and secular knowledge as the criteria for belief. </p>
<p align="center"><b>Potts(1905-1910) 205</b></p><p><b>205.</b>
Every verse contains a particular state, or change of state, in the church: the preceding verses, that although thus inclined they nevertheless perceived it to be unlawful; these verses, an incipient 
doubt whether it might not be lawful for them, since they would thus see whether the things they had heard from their forefathers were true, and so their eyes would be opened; at length, in consequence 
of the ascendancy of self-love, they began to think that they could lead themselves, and thus be like the Lord; for such is the nature of the love of self that it is unwilling to submit to the Lord's 
leading, and prefers to be self-guided, and being self-guided to consult the things of sense and of memory-knowledge as to what is to be believed. </p>

<p align="center"><b>Elliott(1983-1999) 205</b></p><p><b>205.</b>
The content of each single verse has to do with a particular state or else change of state within the Church. The initial verses describe how they still perceived that such a course of action was forbidden 
even though they had an inclination towards it. The two present verses describe how they began to doubt whether it was forbidden them, since they would in that way see whether the things they had 
heard from the people of earliest times were true, and in that way their eyes would be opened. These two verses finally describe how, since self-love began to reign with them, they were able to be 
their own guides and so be like the Lord. It is characteristic of self-love that people do not wish to be led from the Lord but from themselves. And when this is so people rely in matters of belief on 
sensory evidence and factual knowledge.  </p>

<p align="center"><b>Latin(1748-1756) 205</b>
</p><b>205.</b>
Unusquisque versiculus continet peculiarem statum aut status mutationem in Ecclesia; primi versus, quod perceperint adhuc illicitum esse tametsi inclinabant: hi versus, quod inceperint dubitare annon 
liceret eis, quia sic viderent num vera essent quae audiverunt ab antiquis, et sic aperirentur oculi; tandem, quia apud eos regnare coepit amor sui, quod potuissent semet ducere et sic similes esse 
Domino. Amor sui id secum habet, quod non duci velint a Domino sed a semet, et cum a semet, quod consulant de credendis sensualia et scientifica. </p>
