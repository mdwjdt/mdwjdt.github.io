<h3 align="center" class="ired">属天的奥秘 第5337节</h3>
<h4 align="center"></h4><p><strong>5337.</strong>“约瑟从法老面前出去”表当属世层总体上属于属灵层的属天层时。这从“出去”的含义，以及“约瑟”和“法老”的代表清楚可知：“出去”是指属于它，如下文所述；“约瑟”是指属灵层的属天层，“法老”是指属世层，如前所述。至于“出去”是指属于它，或是它自己的，这从前后文，以及这个词的灵义明显看出来，因为就灵义而言，“出去”或出来或发出是指使自己以适合别人的形式出现在另一个人面前。因此，人仍是原来的那个人，只是他的表现形式不同了。在约翰福音中，就灵义而言，“出来”论及主：<br />耶稣论到自己说，我出来，也是从神而来的。（约翰福音<a href="http://39-27.cn/约8.42.htm">8:42</a>）<br />父爱你们，因为你们已经爱我，又信我是从父出来的。我从父出来，到了世界；我又离开世界，往父那里去。门徒说，我们信你是从神出来的。（约翰福音<a href="http://39-27.cn/约16.27.htm">16:27</a>-<a href="http://39-27.cn/约16.30.htm">30</a>）<br />他们确实知道，我是从神出来的。（约翰福音<a href="http://39-27.cn/约17.8.htm">17:8</a>）<br />现举例说明“出来”或发出是什么意思。当真理是良善所拥有的形式时，也就是当真理以理解力所能明白的形式存在时，就说真理从良善出来或发出。当理解力是意愿所拥有的形式时，也就是当意愿以人的内视可察觉的形式存在时，也可以说理解力是从意愿出来或发出的。思维是理解力的活动，当思维变成言语时，同样可以说它“出来”或发出；当意愿变成行为时，意愿也是如此。当思维变成言语时，它就披上了另一种不同的形式；然而，正是思维如此出来或发出，因为它所披上的话语和声音不过是使思维适合被觉察的辅助物。当意愿变成行为时，意愿同样披上另一种不同的形式；然而，正是意愿以这种形式呈现出来。它所采用的举止和动作不过是使意愿以适合的方式显现并叫人知道的辅助物。也同样可以说外在人从内在人出来或发出，这样做是为了使实质显现，因为外在人无非是赋予内在人或实质的形式，以使它能以适合的方式在它所存在的世界运作。由此明显可知，“出来”、出去或发出在灵义上是什么意思，即当论及主时，“出来”、出去，或发出表示存在于人身形式，因而存在于适合信仰者觉知的形式里面的神性。因为这二者（即神性和人身形式）为一。</p>

And Joseph went out from before Pharaoh. That this signifies when the natural in general belonged to the celestial of the spiritual, is evident from the signification of "going out," as being to belong 
thereto (of which below); and from the representation of Joseph as being the celestial of the spiritual, and of Pharaoh as being the natural (of which above). That "to go out" is to belong thereto, 
or to be its own, is plain from what precedes and what follows, and also from the spiritual sense of this expression; for "to go out" or proceed, in the spiritual sense, is to present one's self before 
another in a form accommodated to him, thus to present one's self the same, but in a different form. In this sense "going out" is said of the Lord in John: </p>
<p>	Jesus said about Himself, I went out and 
am come from God (John 8:42). 	The Father loveth you, because ye have loved Me, and have believed that I went out from God. I went out from the Father, and am come into the world; again, I leave the 
world, and go to the Father. His disciples said, We believe that thou wentest out from God (John 16:27-30). 	They knew of a truth that I went out from God (John 17:8). [2] To illustrate what is meant 
by "going out" or proceeding, let us take the following examples. Truth is said to "go out" or proceed from good, when truth is the form of good, or when truth is good in a form that the understanding 
can apprehend. The understanding also may be said to "go out" or proceed from the will, when the understanding is the will formed, or when it is the will in a form perceivable by the internal sight. 
So in regard to the thought of the understanding, this may be said to "go out" or proceed when it becomes speech; and of the will, that it "goes out" when it becomes action. Thought clothes itself 
with another form when it becomes speech, but still it is the thought that so goes out or proceeds; for the words and tones with which it is clothed are mere additions that cause the thought to be appropriately 
perceived. In like manner the will becomes of another form when it becomes action, but still it is the will that is presented in such a form; the gestures and movements that are put on are 
merely additions that cause the will to appear and affect the beholder appropriately. So also it may be said of the external man, that it "goes out" or proceeds from the internal man, nay, that it does 
so substantially, because the external man is nothing else than the internal man so formed that it may act suitably in the world in which it is. From all this it is evident what "to go out" or proceed 
is in the spiritual sense, namely, that when predicated of the Lord it is the Divine formed as a Man and thereby accommodated to the perception of those who believe; nevertheless both of these are one. </p>

'And Joseph came out from before Pharaoh' means when the natural in general belonged to it. This is clear from the meaning of 'coming out' as belonging to it, dealt with below; from the representation 
of 'Joseph' as the celestial of the spiritual, and of 'Pharaoh' as the natural, both dealt with above. As regards the meaning of 'coming out' as belonging to it, or being its own, this is evident from 
what is said before and after this. It is also evident from the spiritual sense of the expression, for in that sense 'coming out' or going forth is making oneself present before another in a form suited 
to this other. Thus one is still the same person; only the form in which one appears is different. The expression 'coming out' is used in this sense in reference to the Lord, in John, </p>
<blockquote>

regarding Himself, From God I came out and now come. <a href="http://bible.gospelcom.net/cgi-bin/bible?passage=John%208:42&amp;version=ESV&amp;interface=print&amp;showfn=yes&amp;showxref">John 8:42</a>.

<blockquote>
The Father loves you because you have loved Me and have believed that I came out from God. I came out from the Father and have come 
into the world; again I am leaving the world and going to the Father. The disciples said, We believe that You came out from God. <a href="http://bible.gospelcom.net/cgi-bin/bible?passage=John%2016:27,%2028,%2030&amp;version=ESV&amp;interface=print&amp;showfn=yes&amp;showxref">John 16:27, 28, 30</a>.

 To show what is meant by 'coming out' or going forth let some examples be used. Truth is said to come out or go forth from good when truth is the form that good possesses, 
that is, when truth is good existing in a form intelligible to the understanding. The understanding too may be said to come out or go forth from the will when the understanding is the form that 
the will possesses, that is, when the will exists in a form discernible to a person's inner sight. Thought which is the activity of the understanding may in a similar way be said to come out or go 
forth when it is transformed into speech, and so may the will when this is transformed into action. Thought takes on a different form when it is transferred into speech; yet it is still thought which 
comes out or goes forth within such speech, for the words and sounds which are chosen are no more than adjuncts to thought which serve to present it in such a way that it can be discerned. The will in 
a similar way takes on a different form when it is transferred into action; yet it is still the will which is present in that different form. The gestures and movements which it adopts are no more than 
adjuncts to the will which serve to reveal this in a suitable way that enables it to be known. The external man may likewise be said to come out or go forth from the internal man, and to do so as that 
which manifests the substance, for the external man is nothing else than the form given to the internal man [or the substance], enabling it to function in a proper way in the world in which it exists. 
From all these examples one may see what is meant in the spiritual sense by 'coming out' or going forth, namely that when used in reference to the Lord, 'coming out' or going forth means the Divine 
existing within a human form, thus in a form suited to believers' perception. For these two [the Divine and the human form] exist as one.

`Et exivit Joseph a coram Pharaone':  quod significet cum ipsius esset naturale in communi, constat a significatione `exire' quod sit ipsius esse, de qua sequitur; ex repraesentatione `Josephi' quod 
sit caeleste spiritualis, et `Pharaonis' quod sit naturale, de quibus supra; quod `exire' sit ipsius esse, vel suum esse, patet (m)ab illis quae praecedunt et quae sequuntur,(n) et quoque a sensu spirituali 
illius vocis, `exire' enim seu procedere in illo sensu, est se sistere praesentem coram alio {1} in forma ei accommodata, {2}ita se eundem modo in alia forma; in hoc sensu dicitur `exire' de Domino, 
apud Johannem,  Jesus dixit de Se, Ego ex Deo exivi et venio, viii 42; </p>
<p>Pater amat vos, quod vos Me amastis et credidistis quod Ego a Deo exiverim: exivi a Patre, et veni in mundum; iterum relinquo 
mundum, et vado ad Patrem.  Dixerunt discipuli, {3} . . . credimus quod a Deo exiveris, xvi 27, 28, 30;  Illi{4} cognoverunt vere quod a Deo exiverim, xvii 8; </p>
<p>[2] ut illustretur quid intelligitur 
per `exire' aut procedere, sint exempla: de vero dicitur quod exeat seu procedat ex bono quando verum est forma boni, seu quando verum est bonum in forma quam capere potest intellectus: de intellectu 
etiam dici potest quod exeat seu procedat ex voluntate quando intellectus est formata voluntas, seu quando est voluntas in forma {5}apperceptibili visui interno: similiter de cogitatione quae intellectus 
dici potest exire seu procedere, cum fit loquela, et de voluntate cum fit actio; cogitatio se induit alia forma cum fit loquela, sed usque est cogitatio quae ita edit aut procedit, verba enim 
et soni quae induuntur, non sunt nisi quam adjecta quae faciunt ut cogitatio appercipiatur accommodate: similiter voluntas fit alia forma cum fit actio, sed usque est voluntas quae in tali forma sistitur; 
{6}gestus et motus qui induuntur, non sunt nisi quam adjecta, quae faciunt ut voluntas appareat et {7} afficiat accommodate: de externo etiam homine dici potest quod exeat seu procedat ab interno, 
immo substantialiter, quia externus homo nihil aliud est quam internus formatus ita ut agat convenienter in mundo in quo est: {8}ex his constare potest quid `exire' seu `procedere' in sensu spirituali 
sit; quod nempe per exire {9}aut procedere cum praedicatur de Domino, sit Divinum formatum ut homo, ita accommodatum ad perceptionem credentium; utrumque tamen unum. @1 i sed$ @2 estque idem$ @3
