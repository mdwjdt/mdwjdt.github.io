<h3 align="center" class="ired">属天的奥秘 第10455节</h3>
<h4 align="center"></h4><p><strong>10455</strong>.“就对摩西说，在营里有战争的噪音”表通过来自地狱的虚假和邪恶向天堂和教会的真理和良善发起的攻击。这从“噪音”、“战争”和“营”的含义清楚可知：“噪音”是指思维和情感，也就是噪音的内在成分，因而是指内层的品质，如前所述（<a href="10454.htm">10454</a>节）；“战争”是指源于良善的真理与来自邪恶的虚假的争战，在反面意义上是指来自邪恶的虚假与源于良善的真理的争战，如下文所述；“营”是指教会和天堂，因为以色列人的营地代表它们（<a href="10038.htm">10038</a>节）。从这些含义明显可知，“在营里有争战的噪音”表示通过来自地狱的虚假和邪恶向教会和天堂的真理和良善发起的攻击。之所以说它们来自地狱，是因为一切虚假和邪恶都来源于地狱，还因为此处当在营中敬拜金牛犊时，“营”表示地狱（<a href="10458.htm">10458</a>节）。<br />“在营里有战争的噪音”之所以表示这些事，是因为现在内义上所论述的主题是以色列民族的内层。他们的内层反对教会和天堂的真理和良善，并且完全反对以至于弃绝它们。因为对自我和世界的爱占据这个民族的内层，这些爱在哪里掌权，教会的真理和良善就在哪里不断受到攻击，无论外在的敬拜行为显得多么神圣。在这些人的敬拜中的神圣是达到目的的手段，显赫和财富才是目的。因此，天堂和教会的东西是手段，世界和自我的东西是目的。一个人所关注的目的就是主人，而手段则是仆人。由此可推知，对这种人来说，天堂是仆人，世界是主人；结果世界占据最高位置，从而占据了头的位置；而天堂占据较低位置，从而占据了脚的位置。因此，天堂若不迎合这些爱，就会被扔在脚下，被践踏，被踩在地上。这种颠倒就存在于那些对自我和世界的爱在里面掌权的人身上，这也解释了为何当被天使观之时，这种人看上去是倒过来的，头朝下，脚朝上。<br />“战争”之所以表示真理与虚假的争战，在反面意义上表示虚假与真理争战，是因为“战争”在灵义上并非别的。圣言的历史叙事中的“战争”，以及先知书部分中的“战争”也表示这类争战，这从前面从圣言中引用的经文能清楚看出来（<a href="1664.htm">1664</a>，<a href="8273.htm">8273</a>节）。人若不知道圣言中的“战争”表示灵义上的战争，就不可能知道包含在关于但以理书7， 8， 11章所提到的战争，以及启示录各处提到的战争，还有福音书（马太福音<a href="http://39-27.cn/太24.5.htm">24:5</a>-<a href="http://39-27.cn/太24.7.htm">7</a>；马可福音<a href="http://39-27.cn/可13.7.htm">13:7</a>，<a href="http://39-27.cn/可13.8.htm">8</a>；以及其它地方）中预言教会末期的地方提到的战争的细节中的含义。也正因如此，一切战争武器，如剑、矛、盾、弓、箭等等，都表示属灵争战的工具；这些在各处的解释中都有所论述。</p>

And he said unto Moses, There is a voice of war in the camp. That this signifies an assault upon the truth and good which are of heaven and of the church, by falsities and evils which are from hell, 
is evident from the signification of "voice," as being the thought and affection which are the interiors of the voice, thus the quality of the interiors (of which above, n. 10454); from the signification 
of "war," as being the combat of truth from good with falsity from evil; and in the opposite sense, the combat of falsity from evil against truth from good (of which in what follows); and from the 
signification of "the camp," as being the church and heaven, for these were represented by the camp of the sons of Israel (n. 10038). From this it is evident that by "a voice of war in the camp" is signified 
an assault upon the truth and the good of the church and of heaven by falsities and evils which are from hell. It is said "from hell," because all falsities and evils are from thence, and because 
here by "the camp," when the golden calf was worshiped in it, is signified hell (n. 10458). [2] That these things are signified by "a voice of war in the camp," is because the subject now treated 
of in the internal sense is the interiors of the Israelitish nation, which were so opposed to the truths and goods of the church and of heaven as utterly to reject them. For the interiors of that nation 
were possessed by the loves of self and of the world, and where these loves reign, there the truths and goods of the church are continually being assaulted, however much in worship the externals 
appear to be holy. With such persons the holiness of worship is a means, and eminence and wealth are the ends. Thus those things which are of heaven and the church are means, and those things which are 
of the world and of self are ends; and the end regarded has command in a man, and the means serve; from which it follows that with such persons heaven serves and the world rules; consequently that the 
world is in the highest place, thus in the place of the head; and heaven is in a lower place, thus in the place of the foot. Wherefore if heaven does not favor their loves, it is then cast down beneath 
the feet, and is trodden and trampled upon. Such is the inversion with those among whom the loves of self and of the world reign. From this also it is that when such persons are viewed by the angels, 
they appear upside down, with the head downward and the feet upward. [3] The reason why "war" denotes the combat with truth and falsity, and in the opposite sense the combat of falsity against truth, 
is that in the spiritual sense "war" is nothing else. Such combats are also signified in the internal sense by "wars" in the historicals of the Word; also by "wars" in the propheticals, as can be 
seen from passages above adduced from the Word (n. 1664, 8273). He who does not know that by "wars" in the Word are signified wars in a spiritual sense, cannot know what is involved in the things related 
concerning wars in Daniel 7, 8, 11; and Revelation throughout; and in the Gospels, where the last times of the church are foretold (Matt. 24:5-7; Mark 13:7, 8; and in other places). Hence also it 
is that all instruments of war, such as swords, spears, shields, bows, arrows, and many others, signify such things as belong to spiritual combat (of which throughout in these explications). </p>

'And he said to Moses, There is the noise of war in the camp' means an assault on the truth and good which are heaven and the Church's by falsities and evils which come from hell. This is clear from 
the meaning of 'the noise' as thought and affection, which are the inner components of the noise, and so the essential nature of the interiors, dealt with above in <a href="10454.htm">10454</a>; from the meaning of 'war' as 
truth which springs from good fighting with falsity that arises from evil, and in the contrary sense as falsity which arises from evil fighting against truth that springs from good, dealt with below; 
and from the meaning of 'the camp' as the Church and heaven, for they are what the camp of the Israelites represented, see <a href="10038.htm">10038</a>. From these meanings it is evident that 'the noise of war in the camp' 
means an assault on truth and good which are the Church and heaven's by falsities and evils which come from hell. They are said to come from hell because all falsities and evils originate there, and because 
at this point in the narrative 'the camp', when the golden calf was worshipped in it, means hell, see below in <a href="10458.htm">10458</a>.  </p>

<p><b>[2]</b>
 The reason why these things are meant by 'the noise of war in the camp' 
is that the subject at present in the internal sense is the interiors of the Israelite nation. Their interiors were contrary to the truths and forms of good of the Church and of heaven, so completely 
contrary that they cast them away. For self-love and love of the world had taken possession of the interiors of that nation, and where those loves reign the Church's truths and forms of good are 
subject to constant attack, no matter how holy the outward acts of worship seem to be. The holiness in those people's worship is a means to an end, and eminence and wealth are their ends in view, so that 
the things of heaven and the Church are means, and those of the world and self are ends. The end which a person has in view is the master, while the means is the servant. From this it follows that 
with people like this heaven is the servant and the world is the master, and consequently that the world occupies the highest position, thus that of the head, while heaven occupies a lower position, 
thus that of the feet. If therefore heaven does not pander to those loves it is cast underfoot, trampled on, and trodden into the ground. Such an inversion exists with those with whom self-love and love 
of the world reign, which also explains why such people when looked at by angels appear inverted, head downwards and feet upwards.  </p>
<p></p>
<p><b>[3]</b>
 The reason why 'war' means truth fighting with falsity, and 
in the contrary sense falsity fighting against truth, is that 'war' in the spiritual sense is nothing other. Such conflicts are also meant in the internal sense by 'wars' in the historical narratives 
of the Word, as well as by 'wars' in the prophetical parts, as becomes clear from the places quoted from the Word in <a href="1664.htm">1664</a>, <a href="8273.htm">8273</a>. Anyone who does not know that in the Word wars in a spiritual sense are 
meant by 'wars' cannot know the implications contained in the details regarding the wars mentioned in Daniel, Chapters <a href="7.htm">7</a>,<a href="8.htm">8</a>,<a href="11.htm">11</a>, also those mentioned in places throughout the Book of Revelation, and 
those in the Gospels where the final times of the Church are the subject, <a href="http://bible.gospelcom.net/cgi-bin/bible?passage=Matt%2024:5-7&amp;version=ESV&amp;interface=print&amp;showfn=yes&amp;showxref">Matt 24:5-7</a>; <a href="http://bible.gospelcom.net/cgi-bin/bible?passage=Mark%2013:7,8&amp;version=ESV&amp;interface=print&amp;showfn=yes&amp;showxref">Mark 13:7,8</a>, and in other places. So it is also that all weapons of war - swords, spears, shields, bows, arrows, 
and more - mean the implements of spiritual conflict; these have been dealt with in the explanations in various places.  </p>

`Et dixit ad Moschen, Vox belli in castris': quod significet oppugnationem veri et boni, quae caeli et Ecclesiae, a falsis et malis quae ab inferno, constat (c)a significatione `vocis' quod sit cogitatio 
et affectio, quae sunt interiora vocis, ita quale interiorum, de qua supra n. 10,454, ex significatione `belli' quod sit pugna veri ex bono cum falso ex malo, et in opposito sensu pugna falsi ex 
malo contra verum ex bono, de qua sequitur; et ex significatione `castrorum' quod sint Ecclesia et caelum; nam per castra filiorum Israelis illa repraesentabantur, videatur n. 10,038; inde patet quod 
per `vocem belli in castris' significetur oppugnatio veri et boni quae Ecclesiae et caeli a falsis et malis quae ex inferno; dicitur ex inferno, quia omnia falsa et mala inde sunt, et quia hic per `castra,' 
cum ibi vitulus aureus colebatur, significatur infernum, videatur infra n. 10,458. 	[2]Quod {1}haec per `vocem belli in castris' {2}significentur, est quia agitur nunc in sensu interno de interioribus 
gentis Israeliticae, {3}cujus interiora contra vera et bona Ecclesiae et caeli erant, ita prorsus ut {4}rejiceret illa; interiora enim {5}istius gentis occupata erant ab amoribus sui et mundi, 
et ubi illi regnant, ibi continue oppugnantur vera et bona Ecclesiae, utcumque externa in cultu {6}sancta appareant esse; sanctum   {7}cultus apud illos est medium, (c)et eminentia (c)ac opulentia 
sunt fines{8}; ita illa quae caeli et Ecclesiae sunt, media sunt, et ea quae mundi et sui, fines sunt, ac finis propter quem apud hominem imperat, et medium servit; inde sequitur quod caelum apud tales 
serviat ac mundus imperet; proinde quod mundus sit supremo loco, ita loco capitis, (c)ac caelum inferiore loco, ita loco pedis; quapropter si caelum non favet amoribus {9}illorum, tunc dejicitur id 
infra pedes, ac calcatur et proculcatur {10}; tale inversum est apud illos apud quos amores sui et mundi regnant;   inde quoque est quod tales inspecti ab angelis appareant inversi   capite deorsum et 
pedibus sursum. 	[3] Quod `bellum' sit pugna veri cum falso, ac in opposito sensu falsi contra verum, est quia `bellum' in spirituali sensu non aliud est; tales pugnae etiam per `bella' in historicis 
Verbi in sensu interno significantur, etiam per `bella' in propheticis, ut constare potest (c)a locis e Verbo allatis n.1664, 8273. Qui non scit quod per `bella' in Verbo significentur bella in spirituali 
sensu, non scire potest quid involvunt illa quae de `bellis'   memorantur apud Danielem vii, viii, xi, quaeque in Apocalypsi passim, et quae apud Evangelistas, ubi de ultimis Ecclesiae temporibus 
agitur Matth. xxiv 5-7; Marc. xi,i 7, 8; (c)et alibi. Inde (d)quoque est quod omnia instrumenta belli, sicut gladii, hastae, scuta, arcus, sagittae, et plura, significent talia quae sunt pugnae spiritualis; 
de quibus passim in explicationibus. @1 hoc$ @2 significetur$ @3 quorum$ @4 rejicerent$ @5 eorum$ @6 quasi sancto sint$ @7 i enim$ @8 propter quem$ @9 ejus$ @10 i , et sic rejicitur$ </p>
