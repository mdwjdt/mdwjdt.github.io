<h3 align="center" class="ired">属天的奥秘 第2209节</h3>
<h4 align="center"></h4><p><strong>2209.</strong>“我既已年老”表它不再具有这样的性质之后，也就是说，这性质不是神性而是纯粹的人性，这时，人性之物要被脱去。这从“年老”的含义清楚可知，“年老”是指要脱去人性，如前所述（<a href="2198.htm">2198</a>，<a href="2203.htm">2203</a>节）。至于一般的理性，当思想神性事物，尤其通过它所具有的真理思想时，它绝不可能相信竟会有这种事。这既因为它不理解它们，还因为由感官幻觉所生的表象粘附于它，而它就凭借这些表象并通过它们思考。这从前面所举的例子（参看<a href="2196.htm">2196</a>节）明显看出来。对此，为了说明，补充以下内容。<br />若请教这理性，它能相信圣言拥有内义 ，并且如前所示，这内义与字义相去甚远吗？它能因此相信圣言就是那将天与地，即将主在天上的国和地上的国联结起来的吗？这理性能相信死后灵魂彼此间有最清晰的交谈，却无需借助词句构成的话语，然而，他们在一分钟内所表达的，比世人用话语在一个小时内所表达的还要充分？并且，天使同样彼此交谈，而且所用的语言更为完美，是灵人们所无法感知的？还有，进入来世的所有灵魂都知道如何运用这种语言，即使他们从未被教导如何这样说话？这理性能相信在人的一种情感，甚至一声叹息里面有无数诸如绝无法予以描述，却被天使察觉的那类事物吗？并且人的每一种情感，甚至构成其思维的每一种观念都是他的一个形像，是诸如以奇妙的方式将其生命的一切细节包括在它里面的那种形像。更不用说其它成千上万的类似事了。<br />这理性的智慧是从感官事物那里得来的，充满感官幻觉。当思考这类事时，它不相信它们会是这样，因为它若不通过诸如凭某种或外在或内在的感官能力所感知的那类事物，就不能为自己形成任何概念。那么，当它思考更为高级的神性属天和属灵事物时，情况会是什么样呢？因为出于感官事物的某些表象必然总是存在，而思维必倚靠它们。当这些表象退出时，这观念也不复存在。这一点也通过以其从尘世所带来的表象为最大快乐的新灵向我显明。他们声称，若这些表象从他们那里被拿走，他们就不知道自己能否思考。就其本身而言，这就是该理性的性质。</p>

And I am become old. That this signifies after it should no longer be of such a nature, namely, not Divine but human, and that this latter should be put off, is evident from the signification of "becoming 
old," as being to put off the human (spoken of above, n. 2198, 2203). As regards the rational in general, when it thinks about Divine things, especially from its own truth, it cannot possibly believe 
that there are such things; both because it does not apprehend them, and because there adhere to it the appearances born from the fallacies of the senses by which and from which it thinks; as is 
evident from the examples adduced above (n. 2196); to which the following may be added for the sake of illustration. [2] If the rational be consulted, can it believe that the Word has an internal sense, 
and this so remote from the literal sense as has been shown? And thus that the Word is that which conjoins heaven with earth, that is, the Lord's kingdom in the heavens with the Lord's kingdom on 
earth? Can the rational believe that souls after death speak with each other most distinctly, without the speech of words, and yet so fully as to express more in a minute than a man does by his speech 
in an hour? And that the angels do the same, but in a speech still more perfect, and one that is not perceivable by spirits? Also, that on coming into the other life all souls know how to speak in this 
way, although they receive no instruction in so speaking? Can the rational believe that in one affection of man, nay, in one sigh, there are such numberless things as can never be described, and yet 
are perceived by angels? And that every affection of man, nay, every idea of his thought, is an image of him, being such as to contain within it in a wonderful manner all the things of his life? Not 
to mention thousands upon thousands of such things. [3] The rational, which is wise from sensuous things, and is imbued with their fallacies, when thinking of such things, does not believe that they 
can be so, because it is unable to form to itself any idea except from such things as it perceives by some sense either external or internal; and what then must be the case when it thinks about Divine 
celestial and spiritual things, which are still higher? For there must always be some appearances from sensuous things, upon which the thought must lean, and when these appearances are withdrawn, the 
idea perishes, as has also been evident to me from novitiate spirits, who take the greatest delight in the appearances which they have brought with them from the world, saying that if these should 
be taken away from them, they did not know whether they could think. Such is the rational as regarded in itself. </p>

<p align="center"><b>Elliott(1983-1999) 2209</b></p><p><b>2209.</b>
'And I have grown old' means after it ceased to be such- that is, ceased to be [merely] human and not Divine - when that which was human was cast off. This is clear from the meaning of 'growing old' 
as casting off the human, dealt with above in <a href="2198.htm">2198</a>, <a href="2203.htm">2203</a>. As regards the rational in general, when it thinks about Divine things, especially from the truth it possesses, it cannot possibly believe that 
such things exist. It is unable to do so because for one thing it has no grasp of them, and for another appearances born from the illusions of the senses cling to it, by means of which and from which 
it thinks, as becomes clear from the examples which have been introduced above in <a href="2196.htm">2196</a>. To these, for the sake of illustration, let the following be added. </p>
<p></p>
<p><b>[2]</b>
 Is the rational, if consulted, able 
to believe in the existence of the internal sense of the Word which, as has been shown, is so remote from the literal sense? And is it thus able to believe that the Word is that which joins heaven and 
earth together, that is, the Lord's kingdom in heaven to the Lord's kingdom on earth? Is the rational able to believe that souls after death converse with one another most distinctly, doing so not by 
means of speech consisting of spoken words, yet nevertheless so completely that they express more in a minute than man does in an hour by the use of his speech; or that the angels likewise converse 
with one another, but in a language which is more perfect still though imperceptible to spirits; and also that all souls on entering the next life know how to use this kind of speech even though they 
are never taught how to do so? Is the rational able to believe that present within one affection which a person has, indeed within a single sigh expressing his affection, there are things perceived by 
angels which are so countless that they cannot possibly be described; or that every affection which a person has, indeed every idea comprising his thought, is an image of him and is such that it includes 
within it in a wondrous fashion every detail of his life, besides thousands upon thousands of other such things?  </p>
<p></p>
<p><b>[3]</b>
 When the rational which derives its wisdom from the evidence of the senses, 
and is wrapped in the illusions of the senses, thinks about such things it does not believe that they can be so, for it is not able to form any idea for itself except from such things as it perceives 
by some sensory power whether external or internal. How must it be when it thinks about Divine celestial and Divine spiritual things which are higher still? For there must always exist, born from the 
evidence of the senses, some appearances for thought to rest upon, and when these appearances are withdrawn the idea ceases to exist. This has also become clear to me from spirits who are newcomers 
and who take very great delight in the appearances they have brought with them from the world. They have said that they did not know whether they would be able to think if those appearances were taken 
away from them. Such is the nature of the rational regarded in itself. </p>

`Et ego consenui': quod significet postquam non amplius tale esset, nempe non Divinum sed humanum, et quod hoc exueretur constat a significatione `consenescere' quod sit exuere humanum, de qua supra 
n. 2198, 2203.  Quod rationale in genere attinet, cum cogitat de Divinis, imprimis ex vero quod ei, nusquam credere potest quod talia sint, tam quia illa non capit quam quia apparentiae quae natae: fallaciis 
sensuum, adhaerent, per quas et ex quibus cogitat, ut constare potest `ex illis exemplis quae allata sunt supra n. 2196; quibus etiam illustrationis causa sequentia addere licet: [2] an rationale 
si consulatur, credere potest quod sensus internus Verbi detur, et is tam remotus a sensu literali, ut {1} ostensum est; et sic quod Verbum sit quod conjungit caelum cum terra, hoc est, regnum Domini 
in caelis cum regno Domini in terris? An rationale credere possit quod animae post mortem inter se loquantur distinctissime, et tamen absque loquela vocum, et usque tam plene ut per minutum plura 
exprimant quam homo per {2} suam loquelam' per horam; et quod angeli similiter, sed loquela adhuc perfectiore et {3} spiritibus imperceptibili; tum quod omnes animae dum in alterum vitam veniunt, ita 
loqui sciant, tametsi nusquam ad (t)ita loquendum instruuntur? Num rationale credere potest quod in una affectione hominis, immo in uno ejus suspirio, tam indefinita insint quae angeli percipiunt ut 
nusquam describi possint; et quod unaquaevis affectio hominis, immo unaquaevis idea cogitationis ejus, sit imago ejus, et talis ut ei insint mirabiliter omnia vitae ejus, praeter millia millia talium? 
[3] Rationale quod ex sensualibus sapit et sensualium fallaciis imbutum est, dum cogitat de illis, non credit ita esse posse, quia sibi formare aliquam ideam nequit {4}, nisi ex talibus quae aliquo sensu 
externo aut {5} interno percipit.  Quid non cum cogitat de Divinis caelestibus et spiritualibus, quae adhuc superiora sunt? Erunt enim semper aliquae apparentiae ex sensualibus, quibus innititur 
{6} cogitatio, quae apparentiae cum abstrahuntur, perit idea; quod etiam constare mihi potuit a spiritibus novitiis, qui maximopere apparentiis quas e mundo secum traxerunt, delectantur, dicentes, si 
illae eis subducerentur, quod non scirent an cogitare possent: tale est rationale in se spectatum. 	@1 tam remotus sit a literali sensu, sicut hactenus.$ 	@2 sua loquela.$ 	@3 ac imo.$ 	@4 de illis 
non est.$ 	@5 et I.$ 	@6 innitura I$ </p>
