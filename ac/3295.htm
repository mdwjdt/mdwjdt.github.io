<h3 align="center" class="ired">属天的奥秘 第3295节</h3>
<h4 align="center"></h4><p><strong>3295.</strong>“这民必强于那民”表一开始真理会胜过真理的良善。这从“民”和“强于”的含义清楚可知：“民”是指真理，如刚才所述（<a href="3294.htm">3294</a>节）；“强于”是指胜过。前一个“民”表示真理，后一个“民”表示真理的良善。真理的良善是由真理所产生的良善，该良善第一次出现时是真理，但被称为良善，因为它看似良善。因此，“民”也表这第一次出现时被称为真理良善的良善。为了对该良善具有某种概念，我们必须知道：人在重生之前出于真理行善，但在重生之后出于良善行善。或说得更清楚点，人在重生之前出于理解力行善，但在重生之后则出于意愿行善。所以，来自理解力的良善本身并非良善，而是真理；而来自意愿的良善才是良善。例如：有人不孝敬父母，但后来按照十诫的要求学习孝敬父母，那么他一开始孝敬他们是由于诫命。像这种来自诫命的孝敬本身并非良善，因为它不是出于爱，而是要么出于对律法的顺从，要么出于对律法的畏惧。尽管如此，它仍被称为真理的良善，但一开始出现时是真理。因为那时这人行的是真理，而非良善。而当此人出于爱孝敬父母时，在这种情况下，它就是良善。这同样适用于一切其它例子。</p>

And the one people shall prevail over the other people. That this signifies that at first truth shall be superior to the good of truth, is evident from the signification of "people," as being truth (see 
just above, n. 3294); and from the signification of "prevailing over," as being superior. The "people" referred to in the first place signifies truth, but the "people" referred to in the second place, 
the good of truth; the good of truth being that good which comes forth from truth, and which in its first coming forth is truth, but is called good because it appears as good. Hence it is that by 
"people" is also signified this good, which in its first coming forth is called the good of truth. In order to have some idea of this good, we must know that before a man has been regenerated he does 
good from truth; but after he has been regenerated he does good from good; or more clearly, before a man has been regenerated he does good from the understanding; but after he has been regenerated, from 
the will. The good therefore that is from the understanding is not in itself good, but truth, whereas the good which is from the will is good. For example: one who does not honor his parents, but 
from the commandment of the Decalogue learns to honor them, when first he honors them, does it from the commandment; and as this honor is from the commandment it is not in itself good, because it is not 
from love, but is either from obedience to the law, or from fear of the law. Nevertheless it is called the good of truth, but in its first coming forth it is truth; for at that time the man does not 
do good, but truth; whereas when the man honors his parents from love, then it is good. The same is true in all other cases. </p>

<p align="center"><b>Elliott(1983-1999) 3295</b></p><p><b>3295.</b>
'And loner people will prevail over [the other] people' means that at first truth must be superior to the good of truth. This is clear from the meaning of 'people' as truth, dealt with immediately above 
in <a href="3294.htm">3294</a>, and from the meaning of 'prevailing over' as being superior to. The 'people' mentioned first means truth, whereas the 'people' mentioned second means the good of truth. The good of truth 
is good which arises out of truth, and, as it exists first of all, is truth. It is called good however because it looks like good. Consequently 'people' also means this good, which is called the good 
of truth as it is when it first arises. </p>
<p></p>
<p><b>[2]</b>
 To have any concept of this good it should be recognized that until he has been regenerated a person does good from truth, but after he has been regenerated 
he does it from good. Or to make the point clearer still, before he has been regenerated the good he does is a product of the understanding, but after he has been regenerated it is a product of the 
will. Good therefore which is a product of the understanding is not in itself good but truth, whereas good that is a product of the will is good. For example, when a person does not honour his parents 
but then learns from the Ten Commandments to do so, his honouring of them is at first a product of the commandment. Such honouring however, being a product of the commandment, is not in itself good 
because it does not flow from love. It flows either from obedience to the law or from fear of the law, but is nevertheless called the good of truth. When it first arises however it is truth, for at that 
time it is not good that he performs but truth. When however his honouring of them is the product of love it is in that case good. The same is so in every other example that could be taken. </p>

</p><b>3295.</b>
`Et populus prae populo valebit': quod significet quod primo verum erit superius quam bonum veri, constat a significatione `populi' quod sit verum, de qua nunc supra n. 3294; et ex significatione `valere 
prae' quod sit superius esse: populus primo loco nominatus significat verum, at populus {1}secundo loco {2}bonum veri; bonum veri est bonum quod existit ex vero, estque in sua prima existentia verum, 
sed vocatur bonum quia apparet ut bonum; inde est quod per `populum' etiam significetur hoc bonum, quod dicitur bonum veri primo existens: [2] ut aliqua idea hujus boni habeatur, sciendum quod homo 
antequam regeneratus est, faciat bonum ex vero, at postquam regeneratus est, faciat bonum ex bono; vel clarius: homo antequam regeneratus est, ex intellectu faciat bonum, sed postquam regeneratus, 
ex voluntate; bonum itaque quod ex intellectu, non est in se bonum, sed verum, at quod ex voluntate, hoc est bonum: ut pro exemplo, qui parentes suos non honorat, at ex praecepto decalogi discit illos 
honorare, is primum dum honorat illos, est ex praecepto; sed is honor, quia est ex praecepto non est bonum in se quia non est ex amore; est vel ex oboedientia legis, vel ex timore legis, at usque dicitur 
bonum veri, {3}sed est in sua prima existentia verum, nam tunc non facit bonum, sed facit verum; at cum honorat illos ex amore, tunc est bonum: ita in reliquis. </p>
