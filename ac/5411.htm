<h3 align="center" class="ired">属天的奥秘 第5411节</h3>
<h4 align="center"></h4><p><strong>5411.</strong>“但约瑟的兄弟便雅悯”表属天层的属灵层，也就是居间层。这从“便雅悯”的代表清楚可知，“便雅悯”是指属天层的属灵层，如前所述（<a href="4592.htm">4592</a>节）；从那里也可以看出属天层的属灵层就是居间层。一般来说，要知道，若没有一个居间物，内在便无法与外在交流，或反过来说，外在无法与内在交流。因此，来自神性的真理，也就是“约瑟”，无法拥有与作为一个总的整体而存在于属世层里面的真理，也就是“雅各的儿子们”有任何交流，除非由“便雅悯”代表、被称为“属天层的属灵层”的居间层存在。要成为居间层，它必须享有内在与外在这二者。居间层之所以必须存在，是因为内在与外在彼此完全不同，并且如此不同，以致它们可以彼此分离，就像人的外在或最低级的部分，也就是他的身体在死亡时可以与他的内在部分分离一样。当居间层与外在分离时，外在就死亡；当居间层在（内在与外在）之间时，外在就存活；而且外在所拥有的生命的量和质就取决于存在于它里面的居间层所拥有的生命的量和质。由于雅各的儿子们没有便雅悯与他们同在，所以约瑟无法向他的哥哥们表明他是谁。由于同样的原因，约瑟向他们说了难听的话，称他们为奸细，还把他们关在看守所里；也由于同样的原因，他们没有认出约瑟。<br />但由“便雅悯”代表、被称为属天层的属层的这个居间层是何性质，却无法明白易懂地被描述出来，因为缺乏关于属灵层的属天层，也就是“约瑟”，以及仅作为记忆知识存在的教会真理，也就是“雅各的儿子们”，因而关于属天层的属灵层，也就是“便雅悯”的知识。但在天堂之光中，该居间层的性质如同在大白天那样显而易见。它的性质可通过利用在天堂之光中所看到的无法描述的代表来揭示，这光同时含有觉知在里面。因为天堂之光是从神性流出的聪明本身，对通过这光所表现的每一个事物的觉知能力便来自这聪明。尘世之光却不是这样，因为这光根本没有任何聪明在里面；然而，理解力却藉着它，即藉着天堂之光进入它的流注，同时藉着天堂之光包含在自己里面的觉知能力的流注而得以形成。正因如此，人在处于聪明的程度内处于天堂之光；在处于信之真理的程度内处于聪明；在处于爱之良善的程度内处于信之真理；因此，人在处于爱之良善的程度内处于天堂之光。</p>

And Benjamin, Joseph's brother. That this signifies the spiritual of the celestial, which is the intermediate,* is evident from the representation of Benjamin, as being the spiritual of the celestial 
(as may be seen above, n. 4592; and also that the spiritual of the celestial is the intermediate). In general it should be known that the internal cannot have communication with the external, and the 
converse, unless there is an intermediate; consequently that truth from the Divine, which is "Joseph," cannot have communication with truths in general in the natural, which are the "sons of Jacob," 
without the intermediate represented by Benjamin, and called the "spiritual of the celestial." An intermediate, to be such, must partake of both the internal and the external. The reason why there must 
be an intermediate is that the internal and the external are most distinct from each other, and so distinct that they can be separated, just as man's ultimate external, which is the body, is separated 
when he dies from his internal, which is his spirit. The external dies when the intermediate is sundered, and the external lives when the intermediate is between; and just so far and in such a way 
does the external live, as is the intermediate between. As Jacob's sons were without Benjamin (that is, without the intermediate), therefore Joseph could not manifest himself to his brethren; and for 
the same reason spoke hardly to them, calling them spies, and putting them in custody; and for the same reason also they did not know Joseph.  [2] But what is the nature of this intermediate represented 
by Benjamin and called the spiritual of the celestial, cannot be described so as to be apprehended, for there is a want of knowledge about the celestial of the spiritual, which is "Joseph," and about 
the truths of the church insofar as they are only memory-knowledges, which are the "sons of Jacob;" hence also about the spiritual of the celestial, which is "Benjamin." But in heaven the nature of 
this intermediate appears as in clear day, being there shown in the light of heaven, in which at the same time is perception by means of unutterable representatives; for the light of heaven is intelligence 
itself from the Divine, and from it there is perceptive power in regard to everything that is represented by means of this light. This is not the case with the world's light, which has nothing 
of intelligence in it; but by its means understanding is induced by the influx of the light of heaven into it, and at the same time by the influx of the perception that is in the light of heaven. Hence 
it is that man is so far in the light of heaven as he is in intelligence, and that he is so far in intelligence as he is in the truths of faith, and that he is so far in the truths of faith as he is 
in the good of love; consequently that man is so far in the light of heaven as he is in the good of love. * See Arcana Coelestia n. 4585: 2, 5, and 6; n. 9421. [Reviser.] </p>

'And Benjamin, Joseph's brother' means the spiritual of the celestial, which is the intermediary. This is clear from the representation of 'Benjamin' as the spiritual of the celestial, dealt with in <a href="4592.htm">4592</a>, where it may also be seen that the spiritual of the celestial is the intermediary. In general it should be recognized that what is internal cannot have any communication with what is external, or 
conversely what is external with what is internal, unless an intermediary exists. Consequently truth from the Divine, which is 'Joseph', cannot have any communication with the truths that exist as a 
general whole within the natural, which are 'the sons of Jacob', unless the intermediary that is represented by 'Benjamin' and is called the spiritual of the celestial is present. And to be the intermediary 
it must partake of both, of both the internal and the external. The reason an intermediary is needed is that the internal and the external are utterly distinct from each other, so distinct that 
they can be separated from each other, just as a person's external or lowest part, which is his body, can be separated when it dies from his internal part, which is his spirit. The external is dead 
when the intermediary is severed from it but living when the intermediary is in place; also, the amount and the nature of the life that the external possesses depends on the amount and nature of the life 
that the intermediary present within it possesses. Because Jacob's sons did not have Benjamin, who is the intermediary, with them, Joseph could not therefore reveal who he was to his brothers. He 
consequently spoke hard words to them, calling them spies and placing them in custody, as a consequence of which they did not recognize him as Joseph. </p>

 But the essential nature of this intermediary 
represented by 'Benjamin' and called the spiritual of the celestial defies any description that is intelligible. For not even any rough ideas exist about the celestial of the spiritual, which is 'Joseph', 
or about the truths of the Church existing merely as known facts, which are 'the sons of Jacob', and therefore no rough ideas exist either about the spiritual of the celestial, which is 'Benjamin'. 
But in the light of heaven the nature of this intermediary is seen as if in broad daylight. Its essential nature is revealed by the use of indescribable representatives seen in the light of heaven, 
which light at the same time holds perception within it. For the light of heaven is essentially intelligence flowing from the Divine which enables every single thing represented in the light of heaven 
to be perceived. The same is not so with the light of the world, for that light does not hold any intelligence at all within it; yet the understanding is formed by means of it - by means of the 
inflowing light of heaven into it, and at the same time by means of the inflowing of the power of perception which the light of heaven contains within itself. This being so, a person dwells in the light 
of heaven insofar as intelligence exists with him, while intelligence exists with him insofar as the truths of faith do so, and the truths of faith exist with him insofar as the good of love does so. 
Consequently a person dwells in the light of heaven insofar as the good of love exists with him. </p>

`Et Benjaminem fratrem (x)Josephi': quod significet spirituale caelestis quod medium, constat ex repraesentatione `Benjaminis' quod sit spirituale caelestis, de qua n. 4592; quod spirituale caelestis 
sit medium, etiam ibi videatur. In genere sciendum quod internum non possit communicationem habere cum externo, et vicissim, nisi sit medium, consequenter {1}quod non communicationem habere possit verum 
a Divino quod est `Josephus', cum veris in communi in naturali quae sunt `filii Jacobi', absque medio quod repraesentatur per`Benjaminem', et vocatur spirituale caelestis; medium ut sit medium, participare 
debet ab utroque, nempe ab interno et ab externo; causa quod medium erit, est quia internum et externum distinctissima inter se sunt, ac ita distincta ut separari queant, sicut separatur externum 
ultimum hominis quod est corpus, cum moritur, ab ejus interno quod est ejus spiritus; tunc moritur externum cum rumpitur medium, et tunc vivit externum cum interest medium; et tantum et taliter 
vivit externum quantum et qualiter medium interest. Quia filii Jacobi absque Benjamine fuerunt, hoc est, absque medio, ideo Josephus se non manifestare potuit fratribus suis, et ideo locutus cum illis 
dura, vocando {2} exploratores, et dando in custodiam,{3} et quoque ideo illi non agnoverunt Josephum.  [2]Sed quale medium hoc sit, quod repraesentatur per `Benjaminem', et vocatur spirituale caelestis, 
ad captum non describi potest; desunt enim notiones de caelesti spiritualis quod est `Josephus', {3} et de veris Ecclesiae, quatenus modo sunt scientifica quae sunt `filii Jacobi', inde quoque de 
{4}`spirituali caelestis' quod est`Benjamin'; at in caelo quale id medium sit, apparet sicut in clara die; exhibetur ibi quale ejus per repraesentativa ineffabilia in luce caeli, in qua simul est perceptio; 
nam lux caeli est ipsa intelligentia a Divino, inde perceptivum {5} est in singulis quae per lucem illam repraesentantur; hoc non datur in luce mundi, nam haec lux nihil intelligentiae in se 
habet, sed intellectus per illam fit per influxum lucis caeli in eam, et simul tunc per influxum perceptivi quod est in luce caeli; inde est quod homo tantum in luce caeli sit quantum est in intelligentia, 
et quod tantum in intelligentia quantum in veris fidei, et quod tantum in veris fidei quantum in bono amoris, consequenter quod homo tantum in luce caeli sit quantum in bono amoris. @1 non caeleste 
spiritualis quod est internum, cum naturali quod est externum, seu quod hic repraesentatur Josephus qui est caeleste spirituale, cum filiis Jacobi, qui sunt vera in communi in naturali, nisi per
