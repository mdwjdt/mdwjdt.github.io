<h3 align="center" class="ired">属天的奥秘 第3636节</h3>
<h4 align="center"></h4><p><strong>3636.</strong>这是一个最普遍且包罗万象的真理：主是天堂的太阳，并且这太阳是来世一切光的源头；天使和灵人，或那些在来世的人，根本看不见来自尘世之光的任何事物；而且，出自其太阳的尘世之光在天使看来，无非是幽暗。从天堂的太阳，或主而来的，不仅有光，还有热；但这些是属灵之光和属灵之热。在天使眼里，这光显为光，却拥有聪明和智慧在里面，因为它是聪明智慧的外在表现。这热被他们的感官感觉为热，却拥有爱在里面，因为热是那爱的外在表现。正因如此，爱也被称为属灵之热，同样构成人的生命之热；而聪明被称为属灵之光，同样构成人的生命之光。其它一切对应关系都是从这种包罗万象的对应关系衍生出来的，因为每一个事物都涉及属于爱的良善和属于聪明的真理。 </p>

<p align="center"><b>Potts(1905-1910) 3636</b></p><p><b>3636.</b>
This is a most universal truth: That the Lord is the Sun of heaven, and that from this Sun is all the light in the other life; and that to angels and spirits, or those who are in the other life, nothing 
at all of the light of the world appears; and also that the light of the world, which is from its sun, is only thick darkness to angels. From the Sun of heaven, or from the Lord, there is not only 
light, but also heat; but it is spiritual light and spiritual heat. To the angels' eyes this light appears as light, but has within it intelligence and wisdom, because this is its source; and by their 
senses this heat is perceived as heat, but there is within it love, because this is its source. For this reason love is also called spiritual heat, and likewise constitutes the heat of man's life; and 
intelligence is called spiritual light, and likewise constitutes the light of man's life. From this universal correspondence all other correspondences are derived; for all things both in general and 
in particular have relation to the good which is of love, and to the truth which is of intelligence. </p>

<p align="center"><b>Elliott(1983-1999) 3636</b></p><p><b>3636.</b>
It is an entirely general and all-embracing law that the Lord is the Sun of heaven and that this is the source of all the light in the next life; that nothing at all from the light of the world is visible 
to angels and spirits, that is, to beings in the next life; and also that the light of the world which comes from the sun is to angels nothing else than thick darkness. From the Sun of heaven, or 
the Lord, comes not only light but also warmth; but these are spiritual light and spiritual warmth. The light that strikes their eyes is seen as light but it holds intelligence and wisdom within it 
since it is the outward manifestation of these. And the warmth is experienced by their senses as warmth but has love within it since it is the outward manifestation of that love. This being so, love is 
called spiritual warmth and is also the producer of the warmth which man's life possesses, while intelligence is called spiritual light and is also the producer of the light which his life possesses. 
From this all-inclusive correspondence all other correspondences are derived, for every single thing has regard to good which belongs to love and to truth which belongs to intelligence. </p>

<p align="center"><b>Latin(1748-1756) 3636</b>
</p><b>3636.</b>
Universalissimum est quod Dominus sit Sol caeli, et quod inde omnis lux in altera vita; et quod angelis et spiritibus seu illis qui in altera vita sunt, nihil prorsus ex luce mundi appareat, et quoque 
quod lux mundi quae a sole, angelis non aliter sit quam caligo; ex Sole caeli seu a Domino est non modo lux, sed etiam calor; sed est lux spiritualis et calor spiritualis; lux coram oculis (c)eorum 
apparet sicut lux, sed habet in se intelligentiam et sapientiam, quia inde est; et calor sensibus illorum percipitur sicut calor, sed ei inest amor, quia inde est; quapropter etiam amor vocatur calor 
spiritualis, et quoque sistit calorem vitae hominis, et intelligentia vocatur lux spiritualis, et quoque sistit lucem vitae hominis: ex hac universali correspondentia derivantur reliquae; nam omnia et 
singula ad bonum quod est amoris et ad verum quod est intelligentiae, se referunt. </p>
