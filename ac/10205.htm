<h3 align="center" class="ired">属天的奥秘 第10205节</h3>
<h4 align="center"></h4><p><strong>10205</strong>.“不可使异样的香上到这坛上”表除了源于对主之爱的敬拜以外，没有源于其它任何爱的敬拜。这从“香”和“异样”的含义清楚可知：“香”是指源于爱的敬拜（参看<a href="9475.htm">9475</a>节）；“异样”或“外人”是指那些虽在教会中，却不承认主的人（<a href="10112.htm">10112</a>节）。由此明显可知，“不可使异样的香上到”表示敬拜若非源于对主之爱，而是源于其它任何爱，就不是敬拜。此处的情形是这样：对主的承认、信和爱是教会里敬拜的全部中最重要的事。因为承认、信和爱创造联结的纽带；承认和信在理解力中创造联结的纽带，而爱则在意愿中创造联结的纽带；这二者构成整个人。因此，凡在教会里不承认主的人都没有与神性的联结；因为一切神性都存在于主里面并来自主。与神性没有联结，就没有拯救。正因如此，敬拜若非源于对主的信和爱，而是源于其它任何信或爱，就不是敬拜。那些在教会之外的人则不然。因为他们对主一无所知，当他们出于自己的宗教信仰过着某种彼此仁爱、对神的某种信和某种爱的生活时，其敬拜就蒙主悦纳，他们当中大多数人都敬拜一个人形式的神。此外，在来世，当被天使教导关于主的事，即祂是在人形式中的神性本身时，他们也承认主。他们在何种程度上过着一种良善的生活，就在何种程度上出于信和爱来敬拜祂（参看<a href="2589.htm">2589</a>-<a href="2604.htm">2604</a>节）。</p>

Ye shall not make strange incense go up upon it. That this signifies no worship from any other love than the love of the Lord, is evident from the signification of "incense," as being worship from love 
(see n. 9475); and from the signification of "strange" as being one who is within the church and yet does not acknowledge the Lord (n. 10112). From this it is evident that by "not making strange incense 
go up," is signified that worship from any other love than that of the Lord is not worship. The case herein is this. Acknowledgment, faith, and love to the Lord, are the principal of all things 
of worship within the church, for acknowledgment, faith, and love conjoin; acknowledgment and faith conjoin there what is of the understanding, and love what is of the will; and these two things make 
the whole man. He therefore who within the church does not acknowledge the Lord has no conjunction with the Divine, for all the Divine is in the Lord and from the Lord; and when there is no conjunction 
with the Divine, there is no salvation. From this it is that worship from any other faith and from any other love than those which are directed to the Lord is not worship. It is otherwise with those 
who are outside the church; for as they are in ignorance about the Lord, their worship is accepted by the Lord when they live from their religion in any mutual charity, and in any faith and in any love 
to God, whom most of them worship under a human form. Moreover, in the other life, when they are instructed by the angels about the Lord, that He is the Divine Itself in human form, they acknowledge 
Him; and insofar as they had been in the good of life, so far they worship Him from faith and love (see n. 2589-2604). </p>

'You shall not cause strange incense to go up on it' means no worship springing from any love other than that of the Lord. This is clear from the meaning of 'incense' as worship springing from love, 
dealt with in <a href="9475.htm">9475</a>; and from the meaning of 'strange' or 'a stranger' as those who are within the Church but do not acknowledge the Lord, dealt with in <a href="10112.htm">10112</a>. From this it is evident that 'you shall not 
cause strange incense to go up' means that no worship springing from any love other than that of the Lord is worship. The situation in all this is that acknowledgement of, faith in, and love to the 
Lord are the most important things of all in worship within the Church. For acknowledgement, faith, and love create a bond; acknowledgement and faith create a bond in the understanding, while love creates 
one in the will. And these two compose the entire person. Anyone within the Church therefore who does not acknowledge the Lord has no link with what is Divine; for everything Divine exists within 
and comes from the Lord. And when there is no link with what is Divine there is no salvation. So it is that worship springing from any faith or love other than faith in and love to the Lord is not worship. 
It is different with those outside the Church. Because they know nothing about the Lord their worship is nevertheless accepted by Him when, true to their religion, they lead lives marked by some 
kind of charity towards one another, some kind of belief, and some kind of love to God, whom the majority of them worship under a human form. In the next life, when taught by angels about the Lord, 
that He is Divinity itself in human form, they too acknowledge the Lord. And to the extent that they had led a good life they worship Him in faith and love, see <a href="2589.htm">2589</a>-<a href="2604.htm">2604</a>.  </p>

`Non ascendere facietis super illo suffimentum alienum': quod significet non cultum ex alio amore quam Domini, constat ex significatione `suffimenti' quod sit cultus ex amore, de qua n. (x)9475, et 
ex significatione `alieni' quod sit {1} qui intra Ecclesiam est et non agnoscit Dominum, de qua n. 10,112; inde patet (t)quod per `non ascendere facietis suffimentum alienum' significetur quod cultus 
ex alio amore quam Domini non sit cultus. Cum his ita se habet: agnitio, fides, et amor in Dominum, sunt principalia omnium cultus intra Ecclesiam, nam agnitio, fides, et amor {2} conjungunt; agnitio 
et fides conjungit ibi intellectuale, et amor voluntarium; et haec bina faciunt totum hominem; qui itaque Dominum intra Ecclesiam non {3}agnoscit, non ei est aliqua conjunctio cum Divino, nam omne Divinum 
est in Domino et a Domino; et cum non aliqua conjunctio est cum Divino, non est aliqua salus; inde est quod cultus ex alia fide, et ex alio amore quam Domini, non sit cultus. Aliter apud illos qui 
extra Ecclesiam sunt; ab illis, quia in ignorantia sunt de Domino, acceptatur usque cultus a Domino, cum illi ex religioso suo in aliqua charitate mutua vivunt, et in aliqua fide et in aliquo amore 
in Deum, (x)quem plerique eorum colunt sub humana forma; illi etiam in altera vita, cum ab angelis informantur de Domino, quod sit ipsum Divinum in humana forma, agnoscunt Ipsum; et quantum in bono vitae 
fuerant, tantum ex fide et amore Ipsum colunt, videatur n. 2589-2604. @1 i illi$ @2 i in spirituali mundo$ @3 agnoscunt, non eis$ </p>
