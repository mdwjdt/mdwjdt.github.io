<h3 align="center" class="ired">属天的奥秘 第1392节</h3>
<h4 align="center"></h4><p><strong>1392.</strong>在来世，一个人的幸福快乐经常通过奇妙的真实传送被传给很多人，他们同样能感受到这些幸福快乐；这些传递不会给那个传递之人带来任何损失。我也获许通过这种传递将快乐传给其他人。由此可见，那些爱邻胜己、只渴望将自己的幸福传给别人的人何等幸福。这种渴望源于主，祂以同样的方式将幸福传给天使。幸福的交流就是这种不断的传递，然而人们却没有想到它们来自这样一个活跃的源头，可以说来自这样一个开放、自愿的决心。</p>

<p><strong>[NCE]1392.</strong> It is also common in the other world for one person to communicate pleasure and happiness in a remarkable way by actually passing them on to a number of others, who are as much affected by them as the original person. The communication takes place without any lessening of the feelings in the person who shares them to begin with.<br />I too was given the opportunity to share my pleasure with others by transferring it to them.<br />You can imagine, then, what kind of happiness exists in people who love their neighbor more than themselves and want nothing more than to spread their happiness to others. Their attitude traces its origin to the Lord, who communicates happiness to angels in the same way.<br />When people share happiness, they are constantly passing it along in the way just described, but they do so without reflecting on their active role in the process and without making a conscious, deliberate decision to engage in it. </p>
<p align="center"><b>Potts(1905-1910) 1392</b></p><p><b>1392.</b>
The delights and happiness in the other life are wont to be communicated from one to many by a real transmission that is wonderful, by which they too are affected in a similar manner; and these communications 
are effected without any loss to him who makes the communication. It has been granted me also thus to communicate delights to others by transmissions. From this may be seen what must be the 
happiness of those who love the neighbor more than themselves, and who desire nothing more than to transfer their happiness to others; a condition that originates in the Lord, who in this manner communicates 
felicities to the angels. The communications of happiness are such continual transmissions; but without any reflection that they are from such an active origin, and from a determination as it 
were open and voluntary. </p>

<p align="center"><b>Elliott(1983-1999) 1392</b></p><p><b>1392.</b>
It is also usual for forms of delight and of happiness in the next life to be communicated from one to many by means of a real transferring that is remarkable, which delight and happiness then affect 
them in a similar way. These communications are effected without any reduction of delight and happiness with the one who communicates them I too have been allowed so to communicate delights to others 
by means of transferences of that kind. This shows what the happiness is like of those who love their neighbour more than themselves and who desire nothing more than to impart their own happiness to 
others. That desire has its origin in the Lord, who in the same way communicates forms of happiness to the angels. Communications of happiness consist in continual transferences like these, yet without 
any reflection upon the fact that they flow from so active a source and so to speak from such an open and willing determination. </p>

<p align="center"><b>Latin(1748-1756) 1392</b>
</p><b>1392.</b>
Jucunditates et felicitates in altera vita quoque communicari solent ab uno pluribus per realem transmissionem quae mirabilis est, quibus similiter ac iis afficiuntur, quae communicationes fiunt absque 
diminutione apud illum qui communicat: datum etiam est mihi jucunditates ita per transmissiones communicare aliis: inde qualis illorum felicitas sit constare potest, qui proximum plus amant quam semet, 
qui nihil plus desiderant quam suam felicitatem transferre in alios; quod ducit originem a Domino, Qui ita felicitates communicat angelis: communicationes felicitatis sunt tales transmissiones continuae, 
sed absque reflexione, quod ab origine activa tali, ei determinatione sicut aperta voluntaria. </p>
