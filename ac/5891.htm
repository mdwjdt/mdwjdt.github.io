<h4 align="center"></h4><p><strong>5891.</strong>创世记45:6-8.因此这地中的饥荒已经二年了，还有五年不能耕种，不能收割。神差我在你们以先来，为要给你们存留余种在这地上，又要大大逃脱，使你们存活。如今看来，差我到这里来的不是你们，乃是神。祂又使我如法老的父，作他全家的主；我已在埃及全地掌权。<br />“因此”表示情况就是这样。“这地中的饥荒已经二年了”表属世心智中的良善缺乏的状态。“还有五年”表这种状态持续的时间，一直持续到余留放光为止。“不能耕种，不能收割”表在此期间将看不到良善和源于良善的任何真理。“神差我在你们以先来”表这是神的旨意所命定的。“为要给你们存留余种在这地上”表教会的中间和至内在部分。“使你们存活”表来自那里、被赐予属世层中的真理的属灵生命。“又要大大逃脱”表从诅咒中解救出来。“如今看来，差我到这里来的不是你们”表不是他们把他交给属世层中的记忆知识。“乃是神”表是神性如此行。“祂又使我如法老的父”表现在属世层倚靠他。“作他全家的主”表属世层中的一切都倚靠他。“我已在埃及全地掌权”表他整理那里的记忆知识。</p>

Verses 6-8. For this two years the famine is in the midst of the land; and there are yet five years wherein is no plowing and harvest. And God sent me before you to put for you remains in the land, and 
to make you live for a great escape. And now not you have sent me hither, but God; and He hath set me for a father to Pharaoh, and for lord to all his house, and I rule in all the land of Egypt. "For 
this," signifies that this is the case; "two years the famine is in the midst of the land," signifies a state of lack of good in the natural mind; "and there are yet five years," signifies the duration 
of this state until remains shine forth; "wherein is no plowing and harvest," signifies that meanwhile good and the derivative truth will not appear; "and God sent me before you," signifies that 
it was determined by the Divine providence; "to put for you remains in the land," signifies the midst and inmost of the church; "and to make you live," signifies spiritual life thence for truths in the 
natural; "for a great escape," signifies deliverance from damnation. "And now not you have sent me hither," signifies that they had not dismissed to the memory-knowledges which are of the natural; "but 
God," signifies that the Divine did this; "and He hath set me for a father to Pharaoh," signifies that now the natural is from him; "and for lord to all his house," signifies that from him is everything 
in the natural; "and I rule in all the land of Egypt," signifies that he arranges the memory-knowledges therein. </p>

Verses 6-8 For this [is the situation] - there have been two years of famine in the midst of the land, and there are still five years, in which there will be no ploughing and harvest. And God sent me 
before you to establish for you a remnant on the earth, and for the bestowal of life on you for a great escape. And now, you did not send me here, but God; add He has established me as father to Pharaoh, 
and as Lord for all his house; and I have dominion in all the land of Egypt. </p>
<p>'For this' means that this is the situation 'There have been two years of famine in the midst of the land' means a 
state when there is a lack of good in the natural mind. 'And there are still five years' means the duration of that state until remnants shine forth. 'In which there will be no ploughing and harvest' 
means that in the meanwhile no good will be seen nor any truth derived from good. 'And God sent me before you' means as ordained by Divine Providence. 'To establish for you a remnant on the earth' means 
the middle and inmost part of the Church. 'And for the bestowal of life on you' means the spiritual life from there that is bestowed on the truths in the natural. 'For a great escape' means deliverance 
from damnation 'And now, you did not send me here' means that they had not handed him over to factual knowledge in the natural. 'But God' means that the Divine had done so. 'And He has established 
me as father to Pharaoh' means that now the natural was dependent on him 'And as lord for all his house' means that everything in the natural was dependent on him. 'And I have dominion in all the land 
of Egypt' means that he sets in order the factual knowledge there.  </p>

Vers. 6-8.  Quia hoc, anni duo famis in medio terrae, et adhuc quinque anni, quibus nulla aratio et messis. Et misit me Deus ante vos ad ponendum vobis reliquias in terra, et ad vivificandum vos ad 
evasionem magnam. Et nunc non vos misistis me huc, sed Deus, et posuit me ad patrem Pharaoni, et ad dominum omni domui suae, et dominor in omni terra Aegypti. `Quia hoc' significat quod ita se habeat: 
`anni duo famis in medio terrae' significat statum defectus boni in mente naturali: `et adhuc quinque anni' significat status illius durationem usque dum reliquiae effulgent: `quibus nulla aratio et 
messis' significat quod interea non appariturum bonum et inde verum: `et misit me Deus ante vos' significat quod consultum ex Divina Providentia: `ad ponendum vobis reliquias in terra' significat medium 
et intimum Ecclesiae: `et ad vivificandum vos' significat vitam inde spiritualem veris in naturali : `ad evasionem magnam' significat liberationem a damnatione: `et nunc non vos misistis me huc' significat 
quod illi ad scientifica quae naturalis non dimiserint: `sed Deus' significat quod Divinum hoc egerit: `et posuit me ad patrem Pharaoni' significat quod nunc naturale ab ipso: `et ad dominum 
omni domui suae' significat quod ab ipso omne in naturali: `et dominor in omni terra Aegypti' significat quod ipse disponat scientifica ibi. </p>
