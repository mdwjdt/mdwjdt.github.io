<h3 align="center" class="ired">属天的奥秘 第9932节</h3>
<h4 align="center"></h4><p><strong>9932.</strong>“归耶和华为圣”表主的神性人身，以及来自那里的一切属天和属灵良善。这从“圣”的含义清楚可知，“圣”是指从主发出的神性，因而是指神性人身方面的主自己，天上的一切神性之物皆来自这神性人身。这解释了为何属天良善，就是源于主的对主之爱的良善，和属灵良善，就是源于主的对邻之爱的良善，都是神圣的；因为唯独主是神圣的，从祂发出之物是天上和地上唯一神圣的（参看<a href="9229.htm">9229</a>，<a href="9680.htm">9680</a>，<a href="9820.htm">9820</a>节）。从主发出的圣物被称为“圣灵”（参看<a href="9818.htm">9818</a>节）；天使、先知和使徒凭他们对来自主的神性真理的接受而被称为圣（<a href="9820.htm">9820</a>节）；“圣所”或圣地凭那里的神性之物而表示天堂（<a href="8330.htm">8330</a>，<a href="9479.htm">9479</a>节）。经上之所以说“归耶和华为圣”，是因为在圣言中，“耶和华”是指主（<a href="9373.htm">9373</a>节所提到的地方）。“归耶和华为圣”之所以刻在金牌上，安在亚伦前额的冠冕上，是因为这样它就不能被所有百姓看见。因此，当进行敬拜时，他们就想起圣物，对某种神圣事物的这种观念就对应于存在于整个天堂，即主的神性人身中的神圣之物。因为如前所述，构成天堂的，这神性人身。能被所有人普遍看见，并由此在每个人的脑海占据主导地位的东西进入思维和情感的一切方面，因而进入敬拜的一切方面，并影响它（<a href="6159.htm">6159</a>，<a href="6571.htm">6571</a>，<a href="7648.htm">7648</a>，<a href="8067.htm">8067</a>，<a href="8865.htm">8865</a>节）。因此，当这种至高的圣物不断保持在他们眼前，并由此在每个人的脑海里占据主导地位时，它就使敬拜的一切事物变得神圣。</p>

Holiness to Jehovah. That this signifies the Divine Human of the Lord, and from this all celestial and spiritual good, is evident from the signification of "holiness," as being the Divine that proceeds 
from the Lord, thus as being the Lord Himself in respect to the Divine Human, from which is everything Divine in the heavens. It is from this that celestial good, which is the good of love to the Lord 
from the Lord; and spiritual good, which is the good of love toward the neighbor from the Lord, are holy. For the Lord alone is holy, and that which proceeds from Him is the only holiness in the heavens 
and on earth (see n. 9229, 9680, 9820). (That the holiness proceeding from the Lord is called "the Holy Spirit," see n. 9818; and that angels, prophets, and apostles, are called "holy" from their 
reception of Divine truth from the Lord, n. 9820; and also that "the sanctuary" denotes heaven from the Divine there, n. 8330, 9479.) It is said, "Holiness to Jehovah," because "Jehovah" in the Word 
denotes the Lord (see the places cited in n. 9373). The reason why "Holiness to Jehovah" was engraved on the plate of gold, and placed upon the miter upon Aaron's forehead, was that in this way it was 
in the view of all the people, consequently there was holiness in their minds while they were in worship, and this holiness corresponded to the holiness that is in the universal heaven, which is the 
Divine Human of the Lord; for as before said this makes heaven. That which is in the general view of all the people, and which thereby reigns universally in their minds, enters into everything of thought 
and of affection, and consequently into everything of worship, and affects it (n. 6159, 6571, 7648, 8067, 8865); and therefore when this very great holiness was constantly before their eyes, and 
from this reigned universally in their minds, it made holy all things of worship. </p>

'Holiness to Jehovah' means the Lord's Divine Human, and all celestial and spiritual good from there. This is clear from the meaning of 'holiness' as what is Divine and emanates from the Lord, thus as 
the Lord Himself in respect of the Divine Human, from which comes everything Divine in heaven. This explains why celestial good, which is the good of love to the Lord derived from the Lord, and spiritual 
good, which is the good of love towards the neighbour derived from the Lord, are holy; for the Lord alone is holy, and what emanates from Him, this alone, is holy in heaven and on earth, <a href="9229.htm">9229</a>, <a href="9680.htm">9680</a>, <a href="9820.htm">9820</a>. Also that which is holy, emanating from the Lord, is called the Holy Spirit, <a href="9818.htm">9818</a>; angels, prophets, and apostles are called holy by virtue of their reception of Divine Truth from the Lord, 
<a href="9820.htm">9820</a>; and 'the sanctuary' or holy place means heaven by virtue of what is Divine there, <a href="8330.htm">8330</a>, <a href="9479.htm">9479</a>. 'Holiness to Jehovah' is a designation that is used because in the Word Jehovah is the Lord, see the 
places referred to in <a href="9373.htm">9373</a>. The reason why 'Holiness to Jehovah' was engraved on a plate of gold and placed on the turban over Aaron's forehead was that so placed it could then be seen by all the people. 
As a consequence of this they had in mind what is holy when they engaged in worship, and this idea of something holy corresponded to that which is holy and is present in the whole of heaven, namely 
the Lord's Divine Human. For as has been stated, this is what composes heaven. What can be seen generally by all the people and for this reason reigns in everyone's mind enters into every aspect of 
thought and affection, consequently into every aspect of worship, and influences it, <a href="6159.htm">6159</a>, <a href="6571.htm">6571</a>, <a href="7648.htm">7648</a>, <a href="8067.htm">8067</a>, <a href="8865.htm">8865</a>. Therefore since what was supremely holy was kept continually before their eyes, and 
consequently reigned in everyone's mind, it rendered everything of worship holy.  </p>

`Sanctitas Jehovae': quod (x)significet Divinum Humanum Domini, et inde omne bonum caeleste et spirituale, constat ex significatione `sanctitatis' quod sit Divinum procedens a Domino, ita quod sit Ipse 
Dominus quoad Divinum Humanum, a quo omne Divinum in caelis; inde est quod bonum caeleste, quod est bonum amoris in Dominum a Domino, et bonum spirituale, quod est bonum {1}amoris erga proximum a 
Domino, sancta sint, {2}nam Dominus solus est sanctus, et quod procedit ab Ipso est solum sanctum in caelis et in terris, n. 9229, 9680, 9820, et quod sanctum procedens a Domino dicatur Spiritus sanctus, 
n. 9858, et quod angeli, prophetae, et apostoli dicantur sancti a receptione Divini Veri a Domino, n. 9820, tum quod sanctuarium sit caelum a Divino ibi, n. 8330, 9479; Sanctitas Jehovae dicitur quia 
Jehovah in Verbo est Dominus, videantur loca citata n. 9373. Quod Sanctitas Jehovae {3}fuerit insculpta bracteae auri (c)ac posita super cidari {4}super fronte Aharonis, {5}fuit causa quia (t)sic 
erat in conspectu omnis populi, {6} inde sanctum in mentibus eorum cum erant in cultu, et id sanctum correspondebat sancto, quod est in universo caelo, quod est Divinum Humanum Domini, nam hoc, ut dictum 
est, facit caelum. Quod {7}est in communi aspectu omnis populi et sic regnat in mentibus universaliter, id intrat in omne cogitationis et affectionis, et inde in omne cultus, et afficit {8}illud, 
n. 6159, 6571, 7648, 8067, 8865; quapropter cum sanctissimum illud fuit jugiter coram oculis, et inde in mentibus regnabat universaliter, sanctificabat illud omnia cultus {9}. @1 fidei$ @2 nam haec
