<h3 align="center" class="ired">属天的奥秘 第9259节</h3>
<h4 align="center"></h4><p><strong>9259.</strong>“务要和他一同移去”表然而要劝诫，并努力纠正。这从“移去”的含义清楚可知，“移去”当论及与教会的良善不一致的虚假时，是指纠正（参看<a href="9258.htm">9258</a>节），在此是指努力纠正，以及劝诫，因为这种虚假很难纠正。与教会的良善不一致的虚假就是所有反对主，反对对主之爱的良善和对邻之仁的良善的虚假。诸如刚才所解释的这些事就隐藏在这丙什么样律法或典章里面，这一点从以下事实明显看出来：字义上所描述的事极少发生。也就是说，人们几乎不会遇见仇敌走迷了的牛或驴，几乎看不见恨他们人的驴卧在重驮之下。因此，这些情况对他们来说并不足够重要，以至于被包括在从西乃山上所宣布的律法和典章中；但它们所包含在自己里面的真理却使它们列在主要典章当中。因为包含这一真理或命令在里面，即：要爱外邦人，教导他们信之真理，引导他们纠正自己的生活。不过，这些法律里面的这些真理不能透露给以色列人和犹太人，因为他们只对外在事物感兴趣，对任何内在事物都不感兴趣；还因为他们从列祖那里领受的是，他们要恨恶所有与他们没有弟兄关系的人，也就是不从雅各所生的人，因而视他们为仇敌。关于犹太人及其本性，可参看前文（<a href="4307.htm">4307</a>，<a href="4314.htm">4314</a>，<a href="4316.htm">4316</a>，<a href="4317.htm">4317</a>，<a href="4429.htm">4429</a>，<a href="4433.htm">4433</a>，<a href="4444.htm">4444</a>，<a href="4825.htm">4825</a>，<a href="4903.htm">4903</a>，<a href="6304.htm">6304</a>，<a href="8588.htm">8588</a>，<a href="8788.htm">8788</a>，<a href="8806.htm">8806</a>，<a href="8871.htm">8871</a>节）。</p>

Removing thou shall remove it with him. That this signifies encouragement, and effort toward amendment, is evident from the signification of "removing," when said of the falsity which does not agree 
with the good of the church, as being amendment (see above, n. 9258), and here effort toward amendment, and encouragement, because such falsity is amended with difficulty. The falsities which do not agree 
with the good of the church are all those which are opposed to the Lord, to the good of love to Him, and to the good of charity toward the neighbor. That such things as have just been unfolded lie 
hidden within these two laws, or judgments, is evident from this additional consideration, that the things contained in the letter seldom happen, namely, meeting an enemy's ox or ass going astray, and 
seeing the ass of one who hates us lying under a burden. Consequently these ordinances are not of sufficient importance to have been included among the laws and judgments that were promulgated from 
Mount Sinai. But the things they contain within them cause them to rank among the chief judgments; for they contain the injunction that the Gentiles too must be loved and be instructed in the truths 
of faith, and be amended in respect to the life. But these internal contents of the laws in question could not be set forth before the Israelitish and Jewish people, because these were in external things 
without internal; and because they had received from their fathers that they should hate, and therefore regard as enemies, all who were not of their brethren, that is, who were not born of Jacob. 
(Concerning the Jews and their character, see n. 4307, 4314, 4316, 4317, 4429, 4433, 4444, 4825, 4903, 6304, 8588, 8788, 8806, 8871.) </p>

'You shall surely remove [it] with him' means nevertheless exhorting and striving hard to correct. This is clear from the meaning of 'removing', when used in reference to falsity which is not in accord 
with the Church's good, as correcting, as above in <a href="9258.htm">9258</a>, at this point striving hard to correct and exhorting since such falsity is not easily corrected. The falsities which are not in accord with 
the Church's good are all those that are contrary to the Lord, and to the good of love to Him and to the good of charity towards the neighbour. Something else which shows that the kinds of things which 
have now been explained lie concealed within these two laws or judgements is the fact that people hardly ever find themselves in the situations described in the literal sense. That is to say, they hardly 
ever meet an enemy's ox or ass going astray, or see the ass of one who hates them lying under its burden. These situations would not therefore have been important enough for them to be included 
among the laws and judgements declared from Mount Sinai; but the truths they hold within themselves place them among the chief judgements. For they hold within them the truth that even the gentiles were 
to be loved, taught the truths of faith, and led to correct their life. But these truths within these laws could not be disclosed to the Israelite and Jewish people because they were interested only 
in things of an external nature and not in anything internal, and because they had received it from their fathers that they should hate and therefore regard as enemies and adversaries all who were not 
related to them as brothers, that is, who were not born from Jacob. Regarding what the Jews were like, see <a href="4307.htm">4307</a>, <a href="4314.htm">4314</a>, <a href="4316.htm">4316</a>, <a href="4317.htm">4317</a>, <a href="4429.htm">4429</a>, <a href="4433.htm">4433</a>, <a href="4444.htm">4444</a>, <a href="4825.htm">4825</a>, <a href="4903.htm">4903</a>, <a href="6304.htm">6304</a>, <a href="8588.htm">8588</a>, <a href="8788.htm">8788</a>, <a href="8806.htm">8806</a>, <a href="8871.htm">8871</a>.  </p>

`Removendo removebis cum illo': quod significet usque {1}hortationem et nisum emendationis, constat ex significatione `removere' cum de falso quod non concordat cum bono Ecclesiae, quod sit emendatio, 
ut supra n. 9258, hic nisus emendationis et exhortatio, quia tale falsum aegre emendatur. Falsa quae non concordant cum bono Ecclesiae sunt omnia illa quae contra Dominum sunt et quae contra bonum amoris 
in Ipsum, et contra bonum {2}charitatis erga proximum. Quod talia, quae nunc explicata sunt, in binis his legibus seu judiciis intus recondita lateant, patet etiam ex eo (x) quod illa quae in littera 
continent raro eveniant, nempe quod occurratur bovi seu asino (x)inimici erranti, et quod videatur asinus osoris cubans sub onere, (c)et inde non tanti ut inter leges et judicia promulgata fuissent 
e monte Sinai; sed illa quae intus in se continent faciunt ut inter praecipua judicia sint; continent enim quod gentes etiam amandae essent, ac (x)instruendae in veris fidei, (c)et (x)emendandae {3}quoad 
vitam; sed haec interna harum legum coram populo Israelitico et Judaico non potuerunt exponi quia in externis erant absque internis, et quia e patribus suis traxerunt quod odio haberent, et inde 
pro inimicis (c}et hostibus omnes qui non ex fratibus suis essent, hoc est, qui non nati ex Jacobo; de {4}Judaeis quales fuerint, videatur n. 4307, 4314, 4316, 4317, 4429, 4433, 4444, 4825, 4903, 6304,
