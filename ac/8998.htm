<h3 align="center" class="ired">属天的奥秘 第8998节</h3>
<h4 align="center"></h4><p><strong>8998.</strong>“就没有权柄把她卖给外邦人”表不可传给那些不是出身于教会信仰的人。这从“外邦人”和“卖”的含义清楚可知：“外邦人”是指那些在教会之外的人，因而是指那些不是出身于教会信仰的人（参看<a href="2049.htm">2049</a>，<a href="2115.htm">2115</a>，<a href="7996.htm">7996</a>节）；“卖”是指疏远，如刚才所述（<a href="8997.htm">8997</a>节）。此中情形是这样：那些生在教会，并且从小就充满教会所教导的基本真理之人不可与那些在教会之外的人通婚，由此充满诸如不属教会的那类观念。原因是，在灵界，他们绝不会彼此结合；因为在灵界，每个人与他人的联系都取决于他的良善和由此衍生的真理。这类人因在灵界绝不会结合，故在世上也不可结合。因为婚姻本质上是两个人的心智与倾向的结合，从信与仁的真理与良善那里获得属灵生命。因此，世上那些具有不同宗教信仰的人之间的婚姻在天堂被视为可憎，教会成员和教会之外的人之间的婚姻尤为可憎。这也是犹太和以色列民族禁止与迦南的外邦人通婚（申命记<a href="http://39-27.cn/申7.3.htm">7:3</a>，<a href="http://39-27.cn/申7.4.htm">4</a>），以及与他们行淫极其可憎（民数记<a href="http://39-27.cn/民25.1.htm">25:1</a>-<a href="http://39-27.cn/民25.9.htm">9</a>）的原因。<br />这一点从婚姻之爱的起源甚至看得更清楚，婚姻之爱源于良善与真理的婚姻（<a href="2727.htm">2727</a>-<a href="2759.htm">2759</a>节）。当婚姻之爱从该婚姻或源头而降时，它就是一个人里面的天堂本身。但当两个配偶的内心因不同的信仰而不同时，这婚姻就被破坏掉了。正因如此，来自以色列的女儿当中，也就是来自教会的婢女或女仆，不可卖给外邦人，也就是不可卖给教会外的人。因为后者会与她订婚，也就是与她结合，由此亵渎教会事物；这解释了为何经上说对她做这种事就是“失信”。</p>

To sell her to a strange people he shall have no power. That this signifies not to those who are not of the faith of the church, is evident from the signification of "a strange people," as being those 
who are outside of the church, thus who are not of the faith of the church (see n. 2049, 2115, 7996); and from the signification of "selling," as being to alienate (of which just above, n. 8997). In 
regard to this, the case is that those who have been born within the church, and from infancy have been imbued with the principles of the truth of the church, ought not to contract marriages with those 
who are outside of the church, and have thus been imbued with such things as are not of the church. The reason is that there is no conjunction between them in the spiritual world, for everyone in that 
world is in consociation according to his good and the truth thence derived; and as there is no conjunction between such in the spiritual world, neither ought there to be any conjunction on earth. 
For regarded in themselves marriages are conjunctions of dispositions and of minds, the spiritual life of which is from the truths and goods of faith and of charity. On this account moreover marriages 
on earth between those who are of a different religion are accounted in heaven as heinous, and still more so marriages between those who are of the church and those who are outside of the church. This 
also was the reason why the Jewish and Israelitish nation was forbidden to contract matrimonies with the Gentiles (Deut. 7:3, 4), and why it was absolutely heinous to commit whoredom with them (Num. 
25:1-9). [2] This appears still more evidently from the origin of conjugial love, which is from the marriage of good and truth (n. 2727-2759). When conjugial love descends from this source, it is heaven 
itself in man. This is destroyed when two consorts are of unlike heart from unlike faith. From this then it is that a maidservant from the daughters of Israel, that is, from those who are of the 
church, was not to be sold to a strange people, that is, to those who are outside of the church; for these would then betroth her, that is, would be conjoined with her, and would thus profane the things 
which are of the church; and therefore it is said that this is "to act treacherously." </p>

'He shall have no power to sell her to a foreign people' means that it must not pass to those who are not of the Church's faith. This is clear from the meaning of 'the foreigner' as those outside the 
Church, thus those who are not of the Church's faith, dealt with in <a href="2049.htm">2049</a>, <a href="2115.htm">2115</a>, <a href="7996.htm">7996</a>; and from the meaning of 'selling' as alienating, dealt with immediately above in <a href="8997.htm">8997</a>. The implications of this are 
that those born within the Church and imbued since early childhood with the fundamental truths taught by the Church ought not to enter into marriages with those who are outside the Church and have 
therefore been imbued with ideas such as are not the Church's. The reason why is that they are in no way joined to one another in the spiritual world; for in that world everyone's association with others 
is determined by his good and from this by his truth. And since such are in no way joined together in the spiritual world, they ought not to be on earth; for essentially a marriage consists of one 
human mind and inclination joined to another's, which derive spiritual life from the truths and forms of the good of faith and charity. Therefore also in heaven marriages on earth between people of different 
religions are thought to be detestable, and especially those between members of the Church and people outside the Church. This also was the reason why the Jewish and Israelite nation was forbidden 
to contract marriages with the nations [in Canaan], <a href="http://bible.gospelcom.net/cgi-bin/bible?passage=Deut%207:3,%204&amp;version=ESV&amp;interface=print&amp;showfn=yes&amp;showxref">Deut 7:3, 4</a>, and why fornicating with them was utterly detestable, <a href="http://bible.gospelcom.net/cgi-bin/bible?passage=Num%2025:1-9&amp;version=ESV&amp;interface=print&amp;showfn=yes&amp;showxref">Num 25:1-9</a>. </p>

<p><b>[2]</b>
 This is made even more plainly evident by the origin of 
conjugial love; that is, it springs from the marriage of goodness and truth, <a href="2727.htm">2727</a>-<a href="2759.htm">2759</a>. Descending from this marriage, conjugial love is heaven itself within someone. But this is destroyed when the 
hearts and faith of two married to each other are not alike. This then is the reason why a female slave from among the daughters of Israel, that is, from the Church, was not to be sold to a foreign people, 
that is, to those outside the Church. For the latter would then betroth her, that is, be joined to her, and in so doing would profane things of the Church, which explains why doing such a thing 
to her is called 'acting treacherously'. </p>

</p><b>8998.</b>
`Populo alienigenae non potestatem habebit vendendi illam': quod significet non illis qui non ex fide Ecclesiae, constat ex significatione `alienigenae' quod sit qui extra Ecclesiam, ita qui non ex 
fide Ecclesiae, de qua n. 2049, 2115, 7996, et ex significatione `vendere' quod sit abalienare, de qua nunc supra n. 8997.  Cum his ita se habet: qui nati sunt intra Ecclesiam et ab infantia imbuerunt 
principia veri Ecclesiae, non conjugia sociare debent cum illis qui extra Ecclesiam et sic imbuerunt talia quae non Ecclesiae sunt; causa est quia nulla conjunctio est inter illos in spirituali mundo, 
quisque enim in eo mundo consociatur secundum {1}bonum et inde verum; et quia nulla inter tales conjunctio est in spirituali mundo, nec ulla conjunctio debet esse in terra, nam conjugia in se spectata 
sunt conjunctiones animorum et mentium, quarum vita spiritualis est ex veris et bonis fidei (c)ac charitatis; idcirco etiam in caelo pro nefandis habentur conjugia in terra inter illos qui diversae 
religionis sunt, et magis {2}inter illos qui ab Ecclesia {3}cum illis qui extra Ecclesiam; haec quoque causa fuit quod prohibitum fuerit genti Judaicae et Israeliticae matrimonia contrahere cum gentibus, 
Deut. vii 3, 4, et quod fuerit prorsus nefandum (x)cum illis scortari, Num. xxv 1-9. 	[2] Hoc patet adhuc evidentius ab origine amoris conjugialis, quod sit ex conjugio boni et veri, n. 2727-2759; 
amor conjugialis cum inde descendit, est ipsum caelum in homine; hoc destruitur cum duo conjuges sunt dissimili corde ex dissimili fide.  Inde nunc est quod ancilla ex filiabus Israelis, hoc est, ex 
illis qui ab Ecclesia, non vendenda esset populo alienigenae, hoc est, illis qui extra Ecclesiam sunt, nam hi dein desponsarent illam, hoc est, ei conjungerentur, et sic profanarent illa quae Ecclesiae 
sunt, quapropter {4}dicitur quod id sit `perfide agere." @1 bona et inde vera sua$ @2 d inter illos qui i si alter sit$ @3 ,et altera$ @4 de eo dicitur id perfide agere.$ </p>
