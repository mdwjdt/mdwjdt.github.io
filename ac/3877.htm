<h3 align="center" class="ired">属天的奥秘 第3877节</h3>
<h4 align="center"></h4><p><strong>3877.</strong>“于是给他起名叫利未”表它的根本性质。这从“名”和“起名”的含义清楚可知，“名”和“起名”是指根本性质，如前所述（<a href="3872.htm">3872</a>节）。这种性质就包含在这些话中：“这次我男人必与我联合，因为我给他生了三个儿子”，如刚才所述（<a href="3875.htm">3875</a>，<a href="3876.htm">3876</a>节）。这种性质就是“利未”和以他命名的支派所表示的，这是教会的第三个普遍属性，或人正在重生或变成教会时的第三个发展阶段，也就是仁爱。至于仁爱，情况是这样：它包含对真理的意愿在里面，并通过对真理的意愿而包含对真理的理解在里面。因为凡处于仁爱的，都拥有这些意愿并理解真理的能力。人在到达仁爱之前，必须经历一个外在阶段，也就是说，先理解真理，然后真理，直到最后他拥有对真理的情感，也就是仁爱。当仁爱存在于人里面时，他注目于主，主在至高意义上由雅各的第四个儿子“犹大”来表示。</p>

<p align="center"><b>Potts(1905-1910) 3877</b></p><p><b>3877.</b>
Therefore she called his name Levi. That this signifies its quality, is evident from the signification of "name," and of "calling a name," as being quality (concerning which above, n. 3872). The quality 
is what is contained in these words: "Now this time will my man cleave to me, because I have borne him three sons" (concerning which words see just above, n. 3875, 3876). This quality is what is signified 
by "Levi," and also by the tribe named from him; and this is the third universal of the church (that is, the third when man is being regenerated, or being made a church), and is charity.  The 
case with respect to charity is that it contains within itself the willing of truth; and through this it contains within itself the understanding of truth; for whoever is in charity has these. But before 
man comes to charity, he must first be in the external, namely, in the understanding of truth; next in the willing of truth; and lastly in being affected with truth, which is charity. And when man 
is in charity, he then looks to the Lord, who in the supreme sense is signified by "Judah," the fourth son of Jacob. </p>

<p align="center"><b>Elliott(1983-1999) 3877</b></p><p><b>3877.</b>
'Therefore she called his name Levi' means the essential nature of it. This is clear from the meaning of 'name' or 'calling the name' as the essential nature, dealt with above in <a href="3872.htm">3872</a>. That nature is 
what is contained in the words, 'Now this time my husband will cling to me, for I have borne him three sons', dealt with immediately above in <a href="3875.htm">3875</a>, <a href="3876.htm">3876</a>. This nature is what is meant by 'Levi', and also 
by the tribe named after him; and it is the third universal attribute of the Church, or the third development when a person is being regenerated or is becoming the Church. It is also charity. The 
situation with charity is that it contains the will for truth within itself, and through the will for truth contains the understanding of truth. For one in whom charity is present possesses those abilities 
to will truth and to understand it. But before a person arrives at charity he must pass through an external stage, that is to say, of understanding truth, then of willing truth, until at last he 
has an affection for truth, which is charity. And when charity is present in that person he looks to the Lord, who is meant in the highest sense by 'Judah', Jacob's fourth son. </p>

</p><b>3877.</b>
`Propterea vocavit nomen ejus Levi':  quod significet quale ejus, constat a significatione `nominis' et `vocare nomen' quod sit quale, de qua supra n. 3871; quale est quod continetur in illis verbis 
`Nunc hac vice adhaerebit vir meus ad me, quia peperi ei tres filios' de quibus {1} mox supra n. 3875, 3876; hoc quale est quod significatur per Levi, tum per tribum ab illo nominatam; </p>
<p>estque {2} 
id tertium universale Ecclesiae, seu tertium cum homo regeneratur aut fit Ecclesia; estque charitas.  Se habet ita cum charitate quod in se contineat velle verum, et per hoc in se contineat intelligere 
verum, nam qui in charitate est, illa habet {3}; at antequam homo ad charitatem venit, tunc primum in externo erit, nempe in intelligere verum, dein in velle verum, demum in affici vero, quod 
est charitas; in charitate cum homo est, tunc spectat Dominum, Qui per `Jehudam,' quartum filium Jacobi, in sensu supremo significatur. @1 quo$ @2 est$ @5 haec$ </p>
