<h3 align="center" class="ired">属天的奥秘 第5682节</h3>
<h4 align="center"></h4><p><strong>5682.</strong>“于是他们俯伏下拜”表外在和内在的谦卑。这从“俯伏”和“下拜”的含义清楚可知：“俯伏”是指外在的谦卑；“下拜”是指内在的谦卑；因为俯伏是程度轻一点的下拜，故它表示外在谦卑；而下拜程度更大一点，故它表示内在谦卑。此外，“俯伏”是指真理的谦卑，或说真理所表现的谦卑，也就是那些处于真理之人的谦卑，因而是那些属灵之人的谦卑；而“下拜”是指良善的谦卑，或说良善所表现的谦卑，也就是那些处于良善之人的谦卑，因而是那些属天之人的谦卑。在这种情况下，“俯伏”也表示外在的谦卑，而“下拜”表示内在的谦卑；因为那些处于良善的人是比那些处于真理的人更内在的人。这些事就包含在本节的内义中；其中绝大多数仅仅解释了这些话的含义，因为它们是诸如此前没有解释过的那些事。</p>

And they bent themselves and bowed themselves down. That this signifies outward and inward humiliation, is evident from the signification of "bending themselves," as being outward humiliation; and from 
the signification of "bowing themselves down," as being inward humiliation; for bending is a less degree of bowing down, and therefore it denotes outward humiliation; and bowing down is a greater degree, 
and therefore it denotes inward humiliation. Moreover, "bending" denotes the humiliation of truth, that is, of those who are in truth, thus of the spiritual; and "bowing down" denotes the humiliation 
of good, that is, of those who are in good, thus of the celestial. In this case also "bending" is outward humiliation, and "bowing down" inward; for they who are in good are more interior men than 
those who are in truth. These things are what are contained in the internal sense of this period. Most of them have been unfolded simply as to the significations of the words, for the reason that 
they are such as have been previously unfolded. </p>

'And they bowed, and bowed down' means an expression of humility, exterior and interior. This is clear from the meaning of 'bowing' as an expression of exterior humility, and from the meaning of 'bowing 
down' as an expression of interior humility. For bowing is something less than bowing down and is therefore an expression of exterior humility, whereas bowing down is something more and is therefore 
an expression of interior humility. In addition to this, 'bowing' is the humility expressed by truth, that is, by those motivated by truth, and so is the humility of those who are spiritual; but 'bowing 
down' is the humility expressed by good, that is, by those motivated by good, and so is the humility of those who are celestial. Thus 'bowing also means the expression of exterior humility, and 
'bowing down' the expression of interior humility; for those motivated by good are people who are more interior than those motivated by truth. The explanation of the major part of the contents of the 
internal sense in this section has been confined simply to the meanings of the words that are used, for the reason that they are matters such as have appeared in explanations prior to this. </p>

`Et deflexerunt se, et incurvarunt se': quod significet humiliationem exteriorem et interiorem, constat ex significatione `deflectere se' quod sit humiliatio exterior, et ex significatione `incurvare 
se' quod sit humiliatio interior; est enim deflexio minor gradus incurvationis, quapropter etiam est humiliatio exterior; {2}et incurvatio est major gradus, quapropter est humiliatio interior; praeterea 
`deflexio' est humiliatio veri, hoc est, illorum qui in vero sunt, ita spiritualium, {2}et `incurvatio' est humiliatio boni, hoc est, illorum qui in bono sunt, ita caelestium; sic quoque (t)`deflexio' 
est humiliatio exterior, et incurvatio humiliatio interior; qui enim in bono sunt, interiores homines sunt quam illi qui in vero.  Haec quae in hac periodo in, sensu interno continentur, pleraque 
explicata sunt quoad solas significationes vocum, ex causa quia sunt talia quae prius explicata sunt. @1 see p. 258, ftnote 4$ @2 at$ </p>
