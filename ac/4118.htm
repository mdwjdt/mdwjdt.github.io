Verses 22-25. And it was told Laban on the third day, that Jacob was fled. And he took his brethren with him, and pursued after him a way of seven days, and joined him in the mountain of Gilead. And 
God came to Laban the Aramean in a dream by night, and said unto him, Take heed to thyself lest thou speak with Jacob from good even to evil. And Laban came up with Jacob, and Jacob pitched his tent in 
the mountain; and Laban pitched with his brethren in the mountain of Gilead. "And it was told Laban on the third day," signifies the end; "that Jacob was fled," signifies separation; "and he took his 
brethren with him," signifies goods in place of those which it had lost; "and pursued after him," signifies continued ardor of conjunction; "a way of seven days," signifies the holy of truth; "and joined 
him in the mountain of Gilead," signifies somewhat of conjunction thereby; "and God came to Laban the Aramean in a dream by night," signifies the obscure perception of that good when left to itself; 
"and said unto him, Take heed to thyself lest thou speak with Jacob from good even to evil," signifies that there was no longer any communication; "and Laban came up with Jacob," signifies something 
of conjunction; "and Jacob pitched his tent in the mountain," signifies the state of the love in which was the good now meant by "Jacob"; "and Laban pitched with his brethren in the mountain of Gilead," 
signifies the state of this good in somewhat of that conjunction. </p>

Verses 22-25 And it was told to Laban on the third day that Jacob had fled. And he took his brothers with him and pursued him for seven days;<A name="fntext1"></a><A href="#fn1"><sup>a</sup></a> and he caught up with him on mount Gilead. And God came 
to Laban the Aramean in a dream by night, and said to him, Take care not to speak to Jacob either good or evil. And Laban overtook Jacob, and Jacob pitched his tent in the mountain, and Laban pitched 
with his brothers in mount Gilead. </p>
<p>'It was told to Laban on the third day' means an ending. 'That Jacob had fled' means a separation. 'And he took his brothers with him' means forms of good replacing 
those which it had lost. 'And pursued him' means a continuing intense desire to be joined. 'For seven days' means the holiness of truth. 'And he caught up with him on mount Gilead' means a kind of 
joining together was thereby effected. 'And God came to Laban the Aramean in a dream by night' means the obscure perception of that good when left to itself. 'And said to him, Take care not to speak to 
Jacob either good or evil' means that no communication existed any longer. 'And Laban overtook Jacob' means a kind of joining together. 'And Jacob pitched his tent in the mountain' means a state of 
love, the state in which the good now meant by 'Jacob' dwelt. 'And Laban pitched with his brothers in mount Gilead' means the state of the good existing to some extent in that joining together.

Vers. 22-25.  Et indicatum Labani in die tertio, quod fugit Jacob. Et accepit fratres suos secum, et persecutus post eum via septem dierum, et adjunxit eum in monte Gilead.  Et venit Deus ad Labanem 
Aramaeum in somnio noctu, et dixit ei, Cave tibi ne forte loquaris cum Jacobo a bono usque ad malum.  Et assecutus Laban Jacobum, et Jacob fixit tentorium suum in monte, et Laban fixit cum fratribus 
suis in monte Gilead. `Indicatum Labani in die tertio' significat finem: `quod fugit Jacob' significat separationem: `et accepit fratres suos secum' significat bona loco illorum quae amisit: 
`et persecutus post eum' significat ardorem continuatum conjunctionis: `via septem dierum' significat sanctum veri: `et adjunxit eum in monte Gilead' significat per id conjunctionis quoddam: `et venit 
Deus ad Labanem Aramaeum in somnio noctu' significat perceptionem obscuram boni illius sibi relicti; `et dixit ei, Cave tibi ne forte loquaris cum Jacobo a bono usque ad malum' significat quod 
nulla communicatio amplius; `et assecutus Laban Jacobum' significat conjunctionis aliquid: `et Jacob fixit tentorium suum in monte' significat amoris statum in quo bonum per Jacobum nunc intellectum: 
`et Laban fixit {1} cum fratribus suis in monte Gilead' significat statum boni in aliquo conjunctionis illius.      @1 Jacob fixit tentorium I$ </p>
