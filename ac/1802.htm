<h3 align="center" class="ired">属天的奥秘 第1802节</h3>
<h4 align="center"></h4><p><strong>1802.</strong>“说，这人必不成为你的后嗣”表外在之物必不成为主国度的后嗣。这从刚才有关“成为后嗣”或“继承”的论述清楚可知。主国度的后嗣并非外在之物，而是内在之物。然而，外在之物也是后嗣，但只有通过内在之物才能成为后嗣。因为此时，这二者行如一体。要理解内中情形如何，必须牢记：天堂里的所有人都是主国度的后嗣，既包括第三层天的人，也包括第一层和第二层天的人，也就是说，既包括内在之人，也包括外在之人和相对内在之人。因为他们全都构成一个天堂。内在事物与外在事物在主天堂里的情形恰如它们在人里面的情形。第一层天的天使从属于第二层天的天使，第二层天的天使则从属于第三层天的天使。然而，这种从属关系并非命令式的从属关系，而是如在人里面那样，是内在之物进入相对外在之物的一种流注；也就是说，主的生命经由第三层天流入第二层天，再经由第二层天流入第一层天，即按照它们的先后顺序流经所有天堂，还直接流入每个个体天堂。相对低级或处于从属地位的天使并不知道这个事实，除非主使他们反思此事。因此，他们的从属关系并非命令式的从属关系。<br />随着内在之物居于第三层天的天使里面，他逐渐成为主国度的一个后嗣；随着内在之物居于第二层天的天使里面，他也逐渐成为一个后嗣；随着内在之物居于第一层天的天使里面，他同样逐渐成为一个后嗣。正是内在之物使得他们每个人成为后嗣。相对内在的天使所拥有的内在之物比相对外在的天使所拥有的更多，因此，前者更接近主，更是祂的后嗣。内在之物是对主之爱和对邻之仁。所以，他们根据自己所拥有爱和仁的程度而成为儿子和后嗣，因为他们在该程度上继承主的生命。<br />但是，没人能从第一层或外在天堂被提升到第二层或更内在的天堂，除非他接受爱之善和信之真的教导。他越接受教导，就越能被提升并进入天使灵当中。天使灵在被提升并进入第三层天，或天使当中之前，也一样。相对内在之物和内在之物通过这种教导形成，并变得适合接受爱之善与信之真，从而接受对善与真的直觉。若不凭借能使人知道何为善与真及其性质的认知，没人能凭直觉明白他所不知和不信的东西，因而没人能被赐予觉察爱之善或信之真的能力。所有人，甚至小孩子，都是这种情形，他们全都在主的国度接受教导。不过，这些人很容易接受教导，因为他们没有充满虚假的定见。然而，他们只被教导总体上的真理，当接受这些真理时，他们所能感知的事物是无可限量的。<br />这方面的情形就象人信服某个总体上的真理或该真理的整体表现时的情形。他很容易好似凭自己，或自发地看到构成总体的各个具体方面，以及构成具体方面的各个细节，它们都具有验证性。因为他被总体上的真理所感染，也会因此被具有验证性的该真理的各个方面和细节所感染。这些伴随快乐和愉悦的具体方面和各个细节会进入总体情感，并由此不断完善它。这些具体方面和各个细节就是内在事物，人们凭这些内在事物而被称为后嗣，也就是说，凭它们而能继承主的国度。不过，只有当对良善的情感，即相爱存在于这些人里面，也就是说，他们通过对善与真的认知，以及对它们的情感而被引入相爱时，他们才开始成为后嗣，或接受产业（inheritance）。对良善的情感，即相爱越存在于这些人里面，他们就越成为“后嗣”，或越接受产业。因为相爱是他们从主的本质，如同从他们的父亲那里那样所接受的真生命。这些事从下一节（5节）的内容可以看出来。</p>

Cooper(2008,2013)</b></p>
<p><strong>[NCE]1802.</strong> Saying, "This one will not be your heir," means that the outward part would not inherit his kingdom, as is established by the symbolism of becoming an heir, or inheriting, discussed just above. The heir of the Lord's kingdom is not the outward part but the inward part. The outward part does inherit it too, but only through the inward part, because they then act as one.<br />To see how the case stands, you need to keep in mind that everyone in the heavens is an heir of the Lord's kingdom. This includes those in the first heaven, those in the second, and those in the third, or in other words, those with little depth and moderate depth just as much as those with great depth, because they all make one heaven. The relation of inner planes to outer in the Lord's heavens is the same as it is in a human being. Angels of the first heaven are under the angels of the second, who are under the angels of the third, but their hierarchy has nothing to do with dominance. Instead, the inner reaches act on the outer ones as they do in an individual human. The Lord's life flows through the third heaven into the second and through this into the first, in prescribed order, as well as flowing directly into each heaven. The lower angels do not realize that the situation is like this unless the Lord inspires them to reflect on it. The hierarchy has nothing to do with dominance, then.<br />[2] The more depth an angel of the third heaven has, the more that angel is heir to the Lord's kingdom. The more depth an angel of the second heaven has, the more that angel is an heir. And the more depth an angel of the first heaven has, the more that angel too is an heir.{*1} Their depth is what makes them heirs. Deeper angels have more depth than shallower angels, so they are closer to the Lord and are more his heirs.<br />Depth consists in love for the Lord and charity for one's neighbor, so the more love and charity angels have, the more they are the Lord's children, or heirs, because the more they have of his life.<br />[3] No one can ever be taken from the first, outermost heaven into the second, deeper heaven without first being taught about the good impulses of love and the true ideas of faith. The more such spirits learn, the more they can be lifted up among angelic spirits. Angelic spirits need similar training before they can be lifted up among angels of the third heaven. Instruction shapes our intermediate levels and so our inmost levels. It prepares them to receive the good impulses of love and the true ideas of faith and therefore to receive a perception of goodness and truth. People cannot possibly perceive something they neither know of nor believe in. Consequently they cannot receive the gift of perceiving love's goodness and faith's truth except through the kind of knowledge that allows them to recognize and evaluate goodness and truth. Everyone is like this, even little children (and in the Lord's kingdom, every child receives instruction), but children learn easily, because false principles do not permeate their minds.<br />They are taught only general truth, however.{*2} When they have learned it, the perceptions they receive are countless.<br />[4] They resemble people who become convinced of some overarching principle. Such people seize quickly, almost intuitively, on the specifics that support the general ideas, and on the individual details that support the specifics. The overarching truth resonates with them, and therefore the specifics and the smaller details supporting that truth do too. The particulars enter into the overall effect, adding pleasure and charm, so they are always perfecting it. These are the inner depths that allow people to be called heirs, or to inherit the Lord's kingdom. They do not become heirs or inherit that kingdom, however, until they devote themselves to what is good — that is, until they enter into the mutual love that angels share. Knowledge of and desire for goodness and truth introduce them into this emotion, and so far as they want what is good, or share in universal love, they are heirs, or inherit the kingdom. Mutual love is the most truly living quality there is, and they receive it from the very being of the Lord, their father. What follows just below in verse <a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_1802/bible_king-james-version_genesis_15_5" target=_top>5</a> also bears this out [<a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_1802/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_1805" target=_top>1805-1810</a>].<br /><br /><strong>Footnotes:</strong><br />{*1} Sometimes (see subsection 3 below and <a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_1802/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_1525" target=_top>1525</a>, <a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_1802/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_1752#subsection-2-2" target=_top>1752:2</a>, <a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_1802/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_1799#subsection-2-2" target=_top>1799:2</a>) Swedenborg distinguishes among the inhabitants of the three heavens as angels, angelic spirits, and spirits (see note 3 in <a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_1802/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_978" target=_top>978</a>). At other times, such as in this passage, he refers to them collectively as angels. [Editors]<br />{*2} It is unclear whether "they" here means good spirits preparing to enter the second heaven and angelic spirits preparing to enter the third, or children in heaven, or both.

<p align="center"><b>Potts(1905-1910) 1802</b></p><p><b>1802.</b>
Saying, This one shall not be thine heir. That this signifies that what is external shall not be the heir of His kingdom, is evident from the signification of becoming an heir, or inheriting, explained 
just above. The heir of the Lord's kingdom is not what is external, but what is internal. What is external is so too, but through what is internal, for they then act as a one. That it may be known 
how the case herein is, it is to be kept in mind that all who are in the heavens-as well those who are in the first and in the second, as those who are in the third,-that is, as well those who are external 
and those who are interior, as those who are internal-are heirs of the Lord's kingdom; for they all make one heaven. In the Lord's heavens, the internals and the externals are circumstanced exactly 
as they are in man. The angels in the first heaven are subordinate to those in the second, and these are subordinate to the angels in the third heaven. The subordination, however, is not that of command, 
but is, as in a man, the influx of things internal into things more external; that is, the Lord's life inflows through the third heaven into the second, and through this into the first, in the 
order of their succession, besides that it inflows immediately into all the heavens. The inferior or subordinate angels do not know that this is so unless reflection is given them by the Lord; thus there 
is no subordination of command.  [2] In proportion to the existence of what is internal in an angel of the third heaven is he an heir of the Lord's kingdom; and in proportion to the same in an angel 
of the second heaven is he an heir; and in like manner, in proportion to the existence of what is internal in an angel of the first heaven, is he too an heir. It is that which is internal that causes 
anyone to be an heir. With the interior angels there is more of what is internal than there is with the more external angels, and therefore the former are nearer to the Lord, and are more fully heirs. 
That which is internal is love to the Lord and charity toward the neighbor; in proportion therefore to the love and the charity which they have, in the same proportion are they sons and heirs, for 
in the same proportion are they partakers of the Lord's life.  [3] But no one can possibly be taken up from the first or external heaven into the second or interior heaven until he has been instructed 
in the goods of love and the truths of faith. So far as he has been instructed, so far he can be taken up, and can come among angelic spirits. It is the same with angelic spirits before they can 
be taken up or come into the third heaven, or among angels. By instruction the interiors are formed, and thereby the internals, and are adapted to receiving the goods of love and the truths of faith, 
and thereby the perception of what is good and true. No one can perceive what he does not know and believe, consequently he cannot be gifted with the faculty of perceiving the good of love and the truth 
of faith except by means of knowledges, so as to know what they are and of what nature. It is so with all, even with infants, who are all instructed in the Lord's kingdom. But these are easily instructed, 
because they are imbued with no principles of falsity; they are however instructed in general truths only; and when they receive these they perceive things without number or limit.  [4] The case 
in this respect is the same as it is with one who has been persuaded respecting any truth in general: the particulars of the general truths, and the singulars of the particulars, which are confirmatory, 
he easily learns, as it were of himself, or spontaneously; for he is affected by the truth in general, and thence also by the particulars and singulars of the same truth, which confirm; for these 
enter into the general affection with delight and pleasantness, and thus constantly perfect it. These are the internal things on account of which they are called "heirs," or by means of which they 
can inherit the Lord's kingdom. But they first begin to be heirs, or to have a heritage, when they are in the affection of good, that is, in mutual love, into which they are introduced by the knowledges 
of good and truth, and by the affections of them; and in proportion as they are in the affection of good, or in mutual love, in the same proportion are they "heirs," or have an inheritance. For mutual 
love is the veriest life [vitale] which they receive from the Lord's essence, as from their Father. These things may be seen from what follows in the next verse. </p>

<p align="center"><b>Elliott(1983-1999) 1802</b></p><p><b>1802.</b>
'Saying, This man will not be your heir' means that that which is external will not be the heir of His kingdom. This is clear from the meaning of 'becoming the heir' or 'inheriting', dealt with already 
just above. The heir to the Lord's kingdom is not that which is external but that which is internal. Yet that which is external is heir as well, but only through that which is internal, for the two 
in that case act as one. To understand what is implied by this, one needs to keep in mind the thought that all who are in the heavens, including those in the first and in the second heavens as well as 
those in the third, that is, including those who are external and those who are more interior as well as those who are internal angels, are the heirs of the Lord's kingdom; for they all constitute one 
heaven. In the Lord's heavens internal things stand in relation to external exactly as they do with man. Angels in the first heaven are subordinate to angels in the second; and these in turn are subordinate 
to angels in the third. That subordination however is not one of command, but, as in man, is an influx of internal things into more external; that is to say, the Lord's life is flowing through 
the third heaven into the second, and through this into the first - through all the heavens in their ordered sequence, as well as into every individual heaven directly. The lower angels, or those in 
a subordinate position, are not aware that this is so unless they are given to reflect on it by the Lord; thus their subordination is not one involving command. </p>
<p></p>
<p><b>[2]</b>
 Insofar as that which is internal 
resides in an angel of the third heaven he is an heir of the Lord's kingdom; also, insofar as that which is internal resides in an angel of the second heaven he too is an heir; and in a like manner, 
insofar as that which is internal resides in an angel of the first heaven he is an heir as well. It is the internal that makes each of them an heir. With angels who are more internal that which is 
internal exists in greater measure than with those who are more external, and therefore they are nearer to the Lord and the more His heirs. That which is internal is love to the Lord and charity towards 
the neighbour. In the measure that they have love and charity therefore they are sons and heirs, for in the same measure they inherit the Lord's life. </p>
<p></p>
<p><b>[3]</b>
 But no one can possibly be brought from 
the first or external heaven into the second or more interior heaven until he has been taught the goods of love and the truths of faith. Insofar as he is taught these he is able to be brought to and 
to enter the company of angelic spirits. Something similar must occur before these angelic spirits are able to be brought to or to enter into the third heaven, that is, into the company of angels. By 
means of such teaching, more interior and then internal things are formed, and are made suitable to receive the goods of love and truths of faith, and so to receive the perception of what is good and 
true. No one is able to see with perception what he does not know and believe. Thus no one can be granted an ability to see perceptively any good of love or truth of faith except through cognitions, which 
enable him to know what good or truth is and the nature of it. This is so with all people, even with young children, all of whom receive teaching in the Lord's kingdom. But these are taught without 
difficulty because they have not been imbued with false ideas. Yet they are taught general truths only, and when they receive them, there is no limit to the things they can perceive. </p>
<p></p>
<p><b>[4]</b>
 It is the 
same as when a person has been persuaded of some truth in its general or overall presentation of itself. He then sees easily and so to speak from himself, or spontaneously, the particular facets that 
make up the general aspects, and the individual details that make up the particular facets, which are confirmatory. For stirred by an affection for a truth in its general presentation, he is also as 
a consequence stirred by the confirmatory facets and details of the same truth. Those particular facets and details, accompanied by delight and pleasantness, enter into the general affection and thereby 
perfect it constantly. Such facets and details are the internal things by virtue of which people are called heirs, that is, by which they are able to inherit the Lord's kingdom. But those people 
first begin to be heirs or to receive the inheritance when an affection for what is good, that is, when mutual love, exists in them, into which they have been introduced by means of cognitions of good 
and truth and by means of affections for these. And insofar as an affection for good, that is, insofar as mutual love, is present in these people, they are heirs or recipients of the inheritance; for 
mutual love is that very life itself which they receive from the Lord's essence, as from their Father. These considerations may also become clear from what follows next in verse 5. </p>

'Dicendo, Non hereditabit te hic': quod significet quod externum non erit heres regni Ipsius, constat a significatione 'heres fieri aut hereditare,' de qua mox prius; heres regni Domini non est externum 
sed est internum; externum quoque est sed per internum, nam tunc unum agunt: ut sciatur quomodo hoc se habet, tenendum quod omnes qui in caelis, tam qui iri primo quam qui in altero sicut qui in 
tertio, hoc est, tam qui externi sunt quam qui interiores sicut qui interni, sunt heredes regni Domini, nam omnes unum caelum faciunt; in caelis Domini se prorsus habent interna et externa, sicut apud 
hominem; angeli qui in primo caelo, subordinati sunt angelis qui in secundo, et hi subordinati angelis qui in tertio, sed subordinatio non est imperii, verum est, sicut in homine, influxus internorum 
in exteriora; influit nempe Domini vita per caelum tertium in alterum et per hoc in primum; hoc per ordinem successionis, praeter quod etiam immediate in omnes caelos; angeli (x)inferiores seu subordinati 
non sciunt quod ita se habeat, nisi detur illis reflexio a Domino, ita non est subordinatio imperii: [2] quantum internum est apud angelum tertii caeli, tantum est heres regni Domini; tum quantum 
internum est apud angelum secundi caeli, tantum est heres; similiter quantum internum est apud angelum primi caeli, tantum quoque est heres; internum facit heredem esse; apud angelos interiores plus 
est internum quam apud angelos exteriores, quare propiores sunt Domino et magis heredes: internum est amor in Dominum et charitas, erga proximum; quantum itaque amoris et charitatis habent, tantum sunt 
filii seu' heredes, nam tantum habent a Domini vita.  [3] Sed a primo seu externo caelo nusquam aliquis in alterum seu interius caelum evehi potest, priusquam instructus est in bonis' amoris et veris 
fidei; quantum instructus, tantum potest evehi et venire inter spiritus angelicos; similiter hi antequam evehi seu venire possint in caelum tertium seu inter angelos; per instructionem formantur interiora, 
et sic interna, et adaptantur ad recipiendum bona amoris et vera fidei, et sic perceptionem boni et veri; nemo potest percipere quod non scit et credit, ita non donari facultate percipiendi bonum 
amoris et verum fidei nisi per cognitiones ut norit quid sit et quale sit; similiter se habet cum omnibus, etiam cum infantibus, qui omnes instruuntur in regno Domini, at hi facile quia nullis principii

is communium particularia, et particularium singularia, quae confirmantia sunt, facile et quasi ex se, aut sponte: arripit; a veritate enim in Communi afficitur, inde etiam ab ejusdem veritatis particularibus
