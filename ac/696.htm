<h3 align="center" class="ired">属天的奥秘 第696节</h3>
<h4 align="center"></h4><p> 696．在来生（灵界），每一个事物都以这样的方式被平衡：邪恶会自我惩罚。所以，每种恶都会自我惩罚。虚假也一样，它会报应处于虚假中的人。因此，每个人所遭受的痛苦和折磨，都是自己招来的，在这种时刻，他会将自己暴露给施加这类折磨的恶魔团伙。主从不将任何人送入地狱，而是希望引导所有人远离地狱，祂更不会将任何人引入痛苦折磨中。但当恶灵自己闯进来时，主会将所有惩罚和折磨转化为良善和某种功用。若非主以某种功用为目的，惩罚是不可能的，因为主的国是用的国。但地狱里的所有人所发挥的功用是最低劣的。当他们致力于这些功用时，就不会遭受太多折磨。不过，一旦完成功用，他们就被送回地狱。</p>

<p><strong>[NCE]696.</strong> Everything in the other life, overall and in particular, exists in such perfect balance that evil punishes itself. In this way, evil contains its own penalty. So does falsity, which rebounds on the person who subscribes to it. We each bring on ourselves our own punishment and torture, and at the same time we bring on the diabolical crowd that inflicts it.<br />The Lord never sends anyone to hell but wants to lead everyone out. Still less does he inflict pain. Instead, since evil spirits actually run to get there, the Lord turns all the punishment and torment to good and puts it to some use. No penalty can ever exist unless the Lord has some purpose in mind for it, because the Lord's kingdom is a realm of purpose and usefulness. But the purposes that hellish spirits can serve are ignominious. When performing those services, they are not in as much pain, but when they cease to be useful, they are returned to hell. </p>

Such is the equilibrium of all things in the other life in both general and particular that evil punishes itself, so that in evil there is the punishment of evil. It is the same with falsity, which returns 
upon him who is in the falsity. Hence everyone brings punishment and torment upon himself, and rushes at the same time among the diabolical crew who inflict such torment. The Lord never sends anyone 
to hell, but would lead all away from hell, and still less does He lead into torment. But as the evil spirit rushes into it himself, the Lord turns all the punishment and torment to good, and to 
some use. No penalty is ever possible unless the Lord has in view some end of use; for the Lord's kingdom is a kingdom of ends and uses. But the uses which the infernals can perform are the lowest uses; 
and when they are engaged in them they are not in so much torment, but on the cessation of the use they are sent back into hell. </p>

Every single thing in the next life is balanced in such a way that evil punishes itself. So evil carries its own punishment with it, as likewise does falsity which comes back on him in whom falsity dwells. 
Consequently the punishment and torment which anybody suffers he brings upon himself, and at such times exposes himself to the devilish crew who inflict them. The Lord never sends anyone to hell, 
but wishes to lead all away from hell; less still does He bring anyone into torment. But since an evil spirit rushes into it himself the Lord turns all the punishment and torment to good and to some 
use. No punishment can possibly take place unless the Lord has some use as the end in view, for the Lord's kingdom is a kingdom of ends and uses. The uses which people in hell can perform however are 
the poorest of all. While they are engaged in these uses their torment is not so great; but once the use has been completed they are returned to hell. </p>

</p><b>696.</b>
Tale est aequilibrium omnium et singulorum in altera vita ut ipsum malum se puniat, sic ut in malo sit poena mali; similiter in falso, quod redit ad illum qui in falso est; inde poenam et cruciatum 
sibi unusquisque inducit, et incurrit tunc in turbam diabolicam quae tale patrat.  Dominus nusquam aliquem in infernum mittit, sed omnes ab inferno educere vult; minus in cruciatum inducit; sed quia spiritus 
malus ipse irruit, vertit Dominus omnem poenam et cruciatum in bonum et in aliquem usum; nulla usquam poena dari potest nisi sit apud Dominum finis usus, nam regnum Domini est regnum finium et 
usuum; sed (x)usus quos praestare possunt infernales, sunt vilissimi, in quibus cum sunt, non ita sunt in cruciatu; sed cessante usu, in infernum remittuntur. </p>
