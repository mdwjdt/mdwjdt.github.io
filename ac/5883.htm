<h3 align="center" class="ired">属天的奥秘 第5883节</h3>
<h4 align="center"></h4><p><strong>5883.</strong>“请挨近我”表更内在的交流。这从“挨近”的含义清楚可知，“挨近”是指更近地交流；当论及相对于内在的外在时，它是指一种更内在层面上的交流。人们不知道与属世人或外在人的交流既是内在的，也是外在的，因为对内在人，对其生命不同于外在人的生命，他还没有为自己形成任何概念。他对内在人所持的唯一概念是，它在里面，与外在人根本没有区别和分离；而事实上，这二者如此不同，以致内在人能与外在人分离，并过着一种与原先一样，但更纯粹的生活。<br />当人死亡时，这一切还会实际发生，因为那时，内在人与外在人分离，分离之后还活着的内在人就是那时被称为灵人的。然而，活在肉身中的，其实也是这个人自己；在来世，在他本人和其他人看来，他仍看似世人，拥有从头顶到脚底的整个形式。他还拥有世人所拥有的那些官能，即触觉、嗅觉、视觉、听觉，以及思考和说话的能力。他拥有的如此完整，以致当他没有反思他在来世这一事实时，会以为他还在世上的肉身，我经常听灵人们谈到这一点。由此可见何为人的内在与外在。若从前面所述对它们形成某种概念，一副更清晰的画面便从解释内在人与外在人时如此频繁地阐述，以及此处“请挨近我”所表示的更内在的交流所描述的东西中浮现出来。</p>

Come ye near to me I pray. That this signifies interior communication, is evident from the signification of "coming near," as being to communicate more closely, which when predicated of the external 
relatively to the internal is to communicate more interiorly. A man knows not that communication with the natural or exterior man is interior and exterior, for the reason that he has not formed for himself 
any idea of the internal man, and of its life being distinct from the life of the external man. Of the internal man he has no other idea than that it is within, not at all distinct from the external, 
when yet they are so distinct that the internal can be separated from the external, and can live the life which it lived before, but purer, which also actually takes place when the man dies, for 
then the internal is separated from the external, and the internal which lives after the separation is what is then called the spirit. But this is the very man himself who lived in the body, and also 
appears to himself and to others in the other life like a man in this world, having his whole form, from the head to the heel. And he is also endowed with the same faculties with which a man in the world 
is endowed, namely, of feeling when he is touched, of smelling, of seeing, of hearing, of speaking, and of thinking; insomuch that when he does not reflect upon the fact that he is in the other life, 
he supposes that he is in his body in the world, as I have sometimes heard said by spirits. From these things it is plain what man's internal and external are. If an idea be thus formed concerning 
them, the things which have so often been said in the explications about the internal and the external man will become somewhat clearer, as well as what is meant by the interior communication which 
is here signified by "Come ye near to me I pray." </p>

<p align="center"><b>Elliott(1983-1999) 5883</b></p><p><b>5883.</b>
'Draw near to me, I beg you' means a more internal communication. This is clear from the meaning of 'drawing near' as communicating in closer proximity, which, in the context of the external in relation 
to the internal, is communicating on a more internal level. People have no knowledge of the fact that communication with the natural or external man is both interior and exterior. And the reason why 
they do not know it is that they have not formed any idea for themselves about the internal man or about the life of the internal, that its life is distinct and separate from that of the external man. 
The only idea anyone has of the internal man is that it exists inwardly but is in no way distinct and separate from the external man, when in actual fact the two are so distinct that the internal 
can be separated from the external and lead a life that is the same only purer. </p>

 This is also what actually happens when a person dies. The internal is separated from the external, and the internal, 
which is alive after that separation, is what is then called a spirit. Yet it is the same person that lived in the body; and to himself, and to others in the next life, he looks like a person in 
the world, fully formed from head to toe. He is also equipped with the same powers that a person in the world has - of sensation when he is touched, of smelling, seeing, hearing, speaking, and thinking. 
He is equipped with them so completely that when he does not stop to reflect on the fact that he is in the next life, he imagines he is in his body in the world, as I have frequently heard spirits 
say. From all this one may see what a person's internal and external are. If some idea is gained of them from what has been said, a somewhat clearer picture will emerge of what has been stated about the 
internal man and the external man so often in explanations, also of what the phrase 'a more internal communication' describes, meant here by 'draw near to me, I beg you'. </p>

`Accedite quaeso ad me': quod significet communicationem interiorem, constat a significatione `accedere' quod sit communicare (x)propius, quod cum praedicatur de {1}externo respective ad {2}internum, 
est communicare interius. Quod communicatio cum naturali seu externo homine sit interior et exterior, homo nescit, {3}ex causa quia nullam ideam sibi formaverat de interno homine et ejus distincta vita 
a vita externi hominis; de interno non aliam ideam habet homo quam quod intus sit, prorsus non (x)distinctum ab externo, cum tamen ita distincta sunt ut internum possit separari ab externo, et vivere 
vitam quam prius sed puriorem; [2] quod etiam actualiter fit cum moritur homo, tunc {4}internum separatur ab externo, et internum, quod vivit post separationem, {5}est quod tunc vocatur spiritus, 
sed est ipse homo qui vixit in corpore, et quoque apparet sibi et aliis in altera vita {6} sicut homo in mundo, cum omni ejus forma a capite ad calcem; {7}et quoque iisdem facultatibus est praeditus quibus 
homo in mundo, nempe sentiendi cum tangitur, odorandi, videndi, audiendi, loquendi, cogitandi, usque adeo ut cum non reflectit super id quod in altera vita sit, putet quod {8}in suo corpore in mundo 
sit, quod a spiritibus {9}aliquoties audivi dictum. Ex his patet quid internum et externum hominis; si inde capiatur idea de illis, {10}aliquantum clariora evadent quae de interno et externo homine 
tam saepe in explicationibus dicta sunt, tum quoque quid intelligitur per communicationem interiorem, quae hic significatur per `accedite quaeso {11}ad me'. @1 interno$ @2 externum, quod sit$ @3
