<h3 align="center" class="ired">属天的奥秘 第472节</h3>
<h4 align="center"></h4><p><strong>472.</strong>“当神造（creat）人的日子”表他被造为属灵之时；“是照着神的样式做（make）的”表他被造为属天之时。这一点从之前所述清楚可知。严格来说，“创造”的表述论及正被新造或重生之人，而“做成”论及正被完善之人。这就是为什么要仔细区分“创造”（create）、“塑造“（form）、“做成”（make），如第二章那样，在此论到属灵之人变成属天之人时，就说“神歇了祂一切创造的工”。其它地方也有这样的区分，其中“创造”论及属灵之人，而“做成”，也就是完善，则论及属天之人（参阅<a href="16.htm">16</a>和<a href="88.htm">88</a>节）。</p>

<p><strong>[NCE]472.</strong> The meaning of on the day on which God created the human as a time when the human became spiritual can be seen from statements made and demonstrated above [<a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_472/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_49" target=_top>49-52</a>]. So can the meaning of in God's likeness he made the human as a time when the human became heavenly [<a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_472/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_51" target=_top>51-52</a>]. Create applies to people specifically when they are being created anew or regenerated and make when they are being perfected. So the distinctions among creating, forming, and making (or doing) are carefully observed in the Word. Chapter <a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_472/bible_king-james-version_genesis_2_1-25" target=_top>2</a> above contains an example, where in talking about the transformation of a spiritual person into a heavenly one it says, "God rested from all the work that he had done as God in creating it" [<a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_472/bible_king-james-version_genesis_2_3" target=_top>Genesis 2:3</a>]. There are many other examples elsewhere. In these places create has to do with a person who is spiritual in nature and make (that is, perfect) with a person who is heavenly in nature. See <a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_472/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_16" target=_top>16</a> and <a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_472/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_88" target=_top>88</a>. </p>

That by the "day in which God created Man" is signified his being made spiritual, and that by "God making him in His likeness" is signified his being made celestial, appears from what was said and shown 
above. The expression to "create" properly relates to man when he is being created anew, or regenerated; and the word "make" when he is being perfected; wherefore in the Word there is an accurate 
distinction observed between "creating" "forming" and "making" as was shown above in the second chapter, where it is said of the spiritual man made celestial that "God rested from all His work, which 
God created in making;" and in other passages also, to "create" relates to the spiritual man, and to "make" that is, to perfect, to the celestial man. (See n. 16 and 88.) </p>

<p align="center"><b>Elliott(1983-1999) 472</b></p><p><b>472.</b>
'On the day in which God created Man' means when he was made spiritual, and 'in the likeness of God He made him' when he was made celestial. This is clear from what has been staled and shown already. 
Strictly speaking, the expression 'to create' has regard to a person while he is being created anew, or regenerated, whereas 'to make' has regard to when he is being perfected. This is why in the Word 
a careful distinction is maintained between 'creating', 'forming', and making', as has appeared already in Chapter <a href="2.htm">2</a> where, the subject being the spiritual man who became celestial, it is said that 
'God rested from all His work which God had created when making it'. The same distinction occurs in other places, where 'creating' has regard to the spiritual man, while 'making', which is perfecting, 
has regard to the celestial man. See <a href="16.htm">16</a> and <a href="88.htm">88</a>.  </p>

</p><b>472.</b>
'In die, quo creavit Deus hominem' quod sit cum spiritualis factus et 'in similitudinem Dei fecit illum' quod sit cum caelestis factus, constat ab illis quae prius dicta et ostensa sunt; vox 'creare' 
proprie spectat hominem cum e novo creatur seu regeneratur; et 'facere' cum perficitur; quare in Verbo accurata fit distinctio inter creare, formare et facere, sicut etiam prius cap. ii ubi agitur de 
spirituali homine facto caelesti, 'quievit Deus ab omni opere suo, quod creavit Deus faciendo,' et passim alibi, ubi 'creare' spectat hominem spiritualem, et 'facere,' quod est perficere, spectat hominem 
caelestem; videatur, n. 16 et 88. </p>
