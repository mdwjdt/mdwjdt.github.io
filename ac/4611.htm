Verses 27-29. And Jacob came unto Isaac his father to Mamre Kiriath-arba, this is Hebron, where Abraham and Isaac sojourned. And the days of Isaac were a hundred years and eighty years. And Isaac expired 
and died and was gathered unto his peoples, old and sated of days; and Esau and Jacob his sons buried him. "And Jacob came unto Isaac his father," signifies now the Divine rational with which it 
was conjoined; "to Mamre Kiriath-arba" signifies its state; "this is Hebron," signifies the state when they were conjoined; "where Abraham and Isaac sojourned," signifies Divine life together; "and the 
days of Isaac were," signifies the state of the Divine rational at this time; "a hundred years and eighty years," signifies the quality of the state; "and Isaac expired, and died," signifies resuscitation 
in the Divine natural; "and was gathered unto his peoples," signifies that it was now among the things which are of the Divine natural; "old and sated of days," signifies newness of life; "and 
Esau and Jacob his sons buried him," signifies that it rose again in the good and the good of truth of the natural. </p>

Verses 27-29 And Jacob came to Isaac his father, to Mamre, Kiriath Arba, which is Hebron, where Abraham and Isaac sojourned. And the days of Isaac were a hundred and eighty years. And Isaac breathed 
his last, and died, and was gathered to his peoples, old and full of days. And Esau and Jacob his sons buried him. </p>
<p>'Jacob came to Isaac his father' means that at this point the Divine Rational was 
joined to the Divine Natural. 'To Mamre, Kiriath Arba' means its state. 'Which is Hebron' means the state when they were joined together. 'Where Abraham and Isaac sojourned' means Divine life together 
with it. 'And the days of Isaac were' means the state of the Divine Rational at this point. 'A hundred and eighty years' means the nature of this state. 'And Isaac breathed his last, and died' means 
an awakening within the Divine Natural. 'And was gathered to his peoples' means that it was now among the things which belonged to the Divine Natural. 'Old and full of days' means newness of life. 'And 
Esau and Jacob his sons buried him' means that it rose again within the good of the Natural and within the good of truth in the Natural. </p>

Vers. 27-29.  Et venit Jacob ad Jishakum patrem suum Mamre Kiriath Arba, haec Hebron, ubi peregrinatus Abraham et Jishak.  Et fuerunt dies Jishaki, centum anni et octoginta anni. Et exspiravit Jishak, 
et mortuus est, et collectus ad populos suos, senex et satur dierum; et sepeliverunt illum Esau et Jacob filii illius. `Venit Jacob ad Jishakum patrem suum' significat quod nunc Divinum Rationale 
cui conjunctum: `Mamre Kiriath Arba' significat statum ejus: `haec Hebron' significat statum cum conjuncta: ubi peregrinatus Abraham et Jishak' significat vitam Divinam simul: `et fuerunt dies 
Jishaki' significat statum Divini Rationalis nunc: </p>
<p>`centum anni et octoginta anni' significat quale status: `et exspiravit Jishak et mortuus est significat exsuscitationem in Divino Naturali: `et 
collectus ad populos suos' significat quod nunc inter illa quae Divini Naturalis: `senex et satur dierum' significat novum vitae: `et sepeliverunt illum Esau et Jacob filii illius' significat quod 
resurrexerit in bono et bono veri Naturalis. </p>
