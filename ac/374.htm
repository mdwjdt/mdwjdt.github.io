<h4 align="center"></h4><p><strong>374.</strong>“血的声音”表已向仁施暴，这一点从圣言的众多经文明显可知。其中，“声音”表发出指控的一切事，“血”表各种罪恶，尤指仇恨，因为凡对兄弟心怀仇恨者，便在心里杀了他，正如主所教导的：“你们听见有吩咐古人的话，说：‘不可杀人，’又说：‘凡杀人的，难免受审判。’只是我告诉你们：凡向弟兄动怒的，难免受审判；凡骂弟兄是拉加的，难免公会的审断；凡骂弟兄是魔利的，难免地狱的火。”（马太福音<a href="http://39-27.cn/太5.21.htm">5:21</a>-<a href="http://39-27.cn/太5.22.htm">22</a>）<br />这些话指出了恨的不同等级。恨是仁的反面，并不择手段地杀害，即便不用手，也会在灵里，仅通过外在的约束只能防止手上的罪行。故，一切仇恨都是“血”，如：“你怎么修饰你的道路要求爱情呢？你的衣襟上有无辜穷人的血。”（耶利米书<a href="http://39-27.cn/耶2.33.htm">2:33</a>-<a href="http://39-27.cn/耶2.34.htm">34</a>）<br />由于“血”表恨，所以“血”同样表各种罪恶，因为恨是所有罪恶的源头。如：“起假誓、撒谎、杀害、偷盗、奸淫、行强暴，以至流人血事件相继而来。因此这地必悲哀，其上的民必消灭。”（何西阿书<a href="http://39-27.cn/何4.2.htm">4:2</a>-<a href="http://39-27.cn/何4.3.htm">3</a>）<br />“你要审判这流人血的城吗？当使她知道她一切可憎的事。这城流人血。你因流了人的血，就为有罪。”（以西结书<a href="http://39-27.cn/结22.2.htm">22:2</a>-<a href="http://39-27.cn/结22.4.htm">4</a>，<a href="http://39-27.cn/结22.6.htm">6</a>，<a href="http://39-27.cn/结22.9.htm">9</a>）这是指同情心的缺乏。又如：“这地满了流血的审判，这城满了强暴。”（以西结书<a href="http://39-27.cn/结7.23.htm">7:23</a>）<br />“因耶路撒冷先知的罪恶，和祭司的罪孽，他们在城中流了义人的血。他们在街上如瞎子乱走，又被血玷污。”（耶利米哀歌<a href="http://39-27.cn/哀4.13.htm">4:13</a>-<a href="http://39-27.cn/哀4.14.htm">14</a>）<br />“主以公义的灵和焚烧的灵将锡安女子的污秽洗去，又将耶路撒冷中杀人的血除净。”（以赛亚书<a href="http://39-27.cn/赛4.4.htm">4:4</a>）<br />“你们的手被血沾染，你们的指头被罪孽沾污。”（以赛亚书<a href="http://39-27.cn/赛59.3.htm">59:3</a>）<br />“我从你旁边经过，见你滚在血中，就对你说：‘活在你的血中吧！’我的确对你说：‘活在你的血中吧！’”（以西结书<a href="http://39-27.cn/结16.6.htm">16:6</a>，<a href="http://39-27.cn/结16.22.htm">22</a>）<br />这指的是发生于耶路撒冷的可憎之事，被称为“血”。在启示录（<a href="http://39-27.cn/启16.3.htm">16:3</a>-<a href="http://39-27.cn/启16.4.htm">4</a>）中，末世的无情与仇恨也用“血”来形容。“血”用复数形式，是因为各种形式的罪孽和可憎之事皆从恨涌出，正如各种形式的良善和圣洁皆从爱涌出一样。因此，凡恨邻舍者，如有可能，就会杀害他，并且极尽所能这么做；也就是说，向他施暴，这就是此处严格意义上的“血的声音”。</p>

<p><strong>[NCE]374.</strong> The symbolism of the voice of blood as violence inflicted on charity can be seen from many places in the Word, where a voice is taken to mean everything that accuses and blood to mean every kind of sin, especially hatred. Those who hate their sister or brother kill her or him in their hearts, as the Lord teaches:<br />You have heard that among the people of old it was said, "You shall not kill; but whoever kills will be subject to judgment." I say to you, though, that any who are angry at their sister or brother without cause will be subject to judgment. Once again, any who say "Raca!"{*1} to their sister or brother will be subject to the Sanhedrin.{*2} But any who say, "Stupid!" will be subject to fiery Gehenna.{*3} (<a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_374/bible_king-james-version_matthew_5_21-22" target=_top>Matthew 5:21-22</a>)<br />These words refer to different degrees of hatred. Hatred opposes charity, and if it does not kill with its hand, it still does so in its mind or heart, in every way it can. External deterrents alone prevent it from killing with its hand. So every form of hatred is blood, as in Jeremiah:<br />Why do you amend your ways so as to seek love? Yes, on your hems{*4} is found the blood of innocent paupers' souls. (<a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_374/bible_king-james-version_jeremiah_2_33-34" target=_top>Jeremiah 2:33-34</a>)<br />[2] Since hatred is blood, so is all wickedness, because the source of all wickedness is hatred, as in Hosea:<br />False swearing and lying and killing and stealing and the committing of adultery; they rob, and blood has followed on blood. Therefore the earth will mourn and everyone living in it will waste away. (<a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_374/bible_king-james-version_hosea_4_2-3" target=_top>Hosea 4:2-3</a>)<br />In Ezekiel:<br />Will you judge the blood-soaked city and let it know all its abominations? The city is shedding blood in its midst. By your blood that you shed you have become guilty. (<a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_374/bible_king-james-version_ezekiel_22_2-3" target=_top>Ezekiel 22:2-3</a>, <a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_374/bible_king-james-version_ezekiel_22_4" target=_top>4</a>, <a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_374/bible_king-james-version_ezekiel_22_6" target=_top>6</a>, <a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_374/bible_king-james-version_ezekiel_22_9" target=_top>9</a>)<br />This is about lack of mercy. In the same author:<br />The earth is full of judgment on [crimes of] blood, and the city is full of violence. (<a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_374/bible_king-james-version_ezekiel_7_23" target=_top>Ezekiel 7:23</a>)<br />In Jeremiah:<br />On account of the sins of Jerusalem's prophets, the transgressions of its priests, who shed the blood of the just in its midst, [those same prophets and priests] wander blind in the streets; they are defiled with blood. (<a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_374/bible_king-james-version_lamentations_4_13-14" target=_top>Lamentations 4:13-14</a>)<br />In Isaiah:<br />... when the Lord washes away the dirt of Zion's daughters, and has cleansed the blood of Jerusalem from its midst, with a spirit of judgment and a spirit of burning. (<a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_374/bible_king-james-version_isaiah_4_4" target=_top>Isaiah 4:4</a>)<br />In the same author:<br />Your palms have been defiled with blood, and your fingers with wickedness. (<a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_374/bible_king-james-version_isaiah_59_3" target=_top>Isaiah 59:3</a>)<br />In Ezekiel:<br />I passed right by you and saw you trampled in your blood, and I told you, "Live in your blood!" And I told you, "Live in your blood!" (<a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_374/bible_king-james-version_ezekiel_16_6" target=_top>Ezekiel 16:6</a>, <a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_374/bible_king-james-version_ezekiel_16_22" target=_top>22</a>)<br />This is about Jerusalem's abominations, which are referred to as blood.<br />[3] The ruthlessness and hatred of the final days are also pictured as blood in <a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_374/bible_king-james-version_revelation_16_3-4" target=_top>Revelation 16:3-4</a>.<br />Blood is used in the plural here [in the original language] because everything wicked and abhorrent wells up out of hatred, just as everything good and holy wells up out of love. Those who hate their neighbor would kill him or her if possible, in every way they are capable of, which is to inflict violence on their neighbor; and violence is what the voice of bloods properly symbolizes here.<br /><br /><strong>Footnotes:</strong><br />{*1} Raca is a Greek form of an Aramaic word meaning "empty," "worthless," "idle." Here it is used as a term of abuse (Liddell and Scott 1968, under ῥακά). [LHC, RS]<br />{*2} The term "Sanhedrin" refers to any of several councils of the Jews in Palestine under Roman occupation. Although the function of the councils is a matter of scholarly dispute — they seem to have served a mixture of executive, judicial, legislative, and religious functions — clearly this particular Sanhedrin is envisioned as a court of law. [SS]<br />{*3} "Gehenna" is a variant name of the Valley of the Children of Hinnom (גֵּיא‭ ‬בֶן-הִנֹּם [gê ḇen-hinnōm]) south of Jerusalem, where the children of Israel once "passed their children through the fire" (sacrificed them) for Moloch, the god of the Ammonites. Josiah, king of Judah, obeying the commands of the recently rediscovered Torah, defiled this site in his campaign against idolatry (<a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_374/bible_king-james-version_2-kings_23_10" target=_top>2 Kings 23:10</a>), and in keeping with this historical defilement, it was later used as a refuse dump. The Old Testament refers to this valley in several places (for instance, <a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_374/bible_king-james-version_jeremiah_7_31-32" target=_top>Jeremiah 7:31-32</a>), and by New Testament times "Gehenna" had become more or less synonymous with hell (and in some versions of the Bible today is so translated). In <a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_374/bible_king-james-version_mark_9_43-45" target=_top>Mark 9:43-45</a>, Christ, quoting <a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_374/bible_king-james-version_isaiah_66_24" target=_top>Isaiah 66:24</a>, describes Gehenna as a place for the wicked, "where their worm does not die, and the fire is not quenched." [LHC, RS]<br />{*4} In both the Hebrew and the Latin, the word here translated "hems" (Hebrew כָּנָף [kānāṕ]; Latin ala) can also mean "wings;" see note 1 in <a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_374/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_777" target=_top>777</a>.

That the "voice of bloods" signifies that violence had been done to charity, is evident from many passages in the Word, in which "voice" denotes anything that accuses, and "blood" any kind of sin, and 
especially hatred; for whosoever bears hatred toward his brother, kills him in his heart; as the Lord teaches: </p>
<p>     Ye have heard that it was said to them of old, Thou shalt not kill, and whosoever 
shall kill shall be in danger of the judgment; but I say unto you, that whosoever is angry with his brother rashly shall be in danger of the judgment; and whosoever shall say to his brother, Raca, shall 
be in danger of the council; but whosoever shall say, Thou fool, shall be in danger of the hell of fire (Matt. 5:21, 22), by which words are meant the degrees of hatred. Hatred is contrary to charity, 
and kills in whatever way it can, if not with the hand, yet in spirit, and is withheld only by external restraints from the deed of the hand. Therefore all hatred is "blood" as in Jeremiah: </p>
<p>   
  Why makest thou thy way good to seek love? Even in thy skirts are found the bloods of the souls of the needy innocent ones (Jer. 2:33-34). [2] And as hatred is denoted by "blood" so likewise is every 
kind of iniquity, for hatred is the fountain of all iniquities. As in Hosea: </p>
<p>     Swearing falsely, and lying, and killing, and stealing, and committing adultery, they rob, and bloods, in bloods have 
they touched; therefore shall the land mourn, and everyone that dwelleth therein shall languish (Hos. 4:2-3). And in Ezekiel, speaking of unmercifulness: </p>
<p>     Wilt thou judge the city of bloods, 
and make known to her all her abominations? a city that sheddeth bloods in the midst of it. Thou art become guilty through thy blood that thou hast shed (Ezek. 22:2-4, 6, 9). In the same: </p>
<p>     The 
land is full of the judgment of bloods, and the city is full of violence (Ezek. 7:23). And in Jeremiah: </p>
<p>     For the sins of the prophets of Jerusalem, and the iniquities of her priests, that have shed 
the blood of the righteous in the midst of her, they wander blind in the streets, they have been polluted with blood (Lam. 4:13-14). 13, 14). In Isaiah: </p>
<p>     When the Lord shall wash away the filth 
of the daughters of Zion, and shall have purged the bloods of Jerusalem from the midst, with the spirit of judgment, and with the spirit of burning (Isa. 4:4). And again: </p>
<p>     Your palms are defiled 
in blood, and your fingers in iniquity (Isa. 59:3). In Ezekiel, speaking of the abominations of Jerusalem, which are called "bloods:"      I passed by thee, and saw thee trampled in thine own 
bloods, and I said unto thee, Live in thy bloods, yea, I said unto thee, Live in thy bloods (Ezek. 16:6, 22). [3] The unmercifulness and hatred of the last times are also described by "blood" in the 
Revelation (16:3, 4). "Bloods" are mentioned in the plural, because all unjust and abominable things gush forth from hatred, as all good and holy ones do from love. Therefore he who feels hatred toward 
his neighbor would murder him if he could, and indeed does murder him in any way he can; and this is to do violence to him, which is here properly signified by the "voice of bloods." </p>

<p align="center"><b>Elliott(1983-1999) 374</b></p><p><b>374.</b>
That 'the voice of blood'<A name="fntext1"></a><A href="#fn1"><sup>a</sup></a> means violence done to charity is clear from many places in the Word where 'voice' stands for everything that accuses, and 'blood' for all sin, especially hatred. For anyone 
who hates his brother murders him in his own heart, as the Lord teaches, </p>
<blockquote>
You have heard that it was said to the men of old, You shall not kill, and whoever kills will be liable to judgement. But 
I say to you that whoever is angry with his brother without cause will be liable to judgement Whoever indeed says to his brother, Raca! will be liable to the Sanhedrin And whoever says You fool! will 
be liable to the Gehenna of fire. <a href="http://bible.gospelcom.net/cgi-bin/bible?passage=Matt%205:21,%2022&amp;version=ESV&amp;interface=print&amp;showfn=yes&amp;showxref">Matt 5:21, 22</a>.   
</blockquote>
These sayings denote degrees of hatred. Hatred is contrary to charity; and though a person does not actually commit murder, the intention to do so 
is still there, and by whatever possible method. It is external restraints alone which prevent murder actually being committed. And this is why all hatred is called blood, as in Jeremiah,  </p>
<blockquote>
How well 
you direct Your way in the quest for love! Yes, in your skirts the blood of needy innocent souls is found. <a href="http://bible.gospelcom.net/cgi-bin/bible?passage=Jer%202:33,%2034&amp;version=ESV&amp;interface=print&amp;showfn=yes&amp;showxref">Jer 2:33, 34</a>. 
</blockquote>
<p></p>
<p><b>[2]</b>
 And since hatred is meant by blood, so is every kind of wickedness, for 
hatred is the source of all wickedness, as in Hosea,  </p>
<p>Perjuring, and lying, and killing, and stealing, and committing adultery, they commit robbery, and blood' has followed on blood.<A name="fntext1"></a><A href="#fn1"><sup>a</sup></a> Therefore the

This is referring to the lack of compassion. In the same prophet, </p>

<p>And in Jeremiah,  </p>
<blockquote>
For the sins of the prophets of Jerusalem, the iniquities of her priests who shed in the midst of her the blood of the righteous, 
they wander blind in the streets; they are defiled with blood. <a href="http://bible.gospelcom.net/cgi-bin/bible?passage=Lam%204:13,%2014&amp;version=ESV&amp;interface=print&amp;showfn=yes&amp;showxref">Lam 4:13, 14</a>.

<p>In Isaiah,  </p>

In the same prophet,     Your hands are defiled with blood, and your fingers with iniquity. <a href="http://bible.gospelcom.net/cgi-bin/bible?passage=Isa%2059:3&amp;version=ESV&amp;interface=print&amp;showfn=yes&amp;showxref">Isa 59:3</a>.

</blockquote>
This refers to the abominations 
of Jerusalem, which are called 'blood'<A name="fntext1"></a><A href="#fn1"><sup>a</sup></a>. Lack of compassion, and hatred, in the last times a real so described as blood in <a href="http://bible.gospelcom.net/cgi-bin/bible?passage=Rev%2016:3,%204&amp;version=ESV&amp;interface=print&amp;showfn=yes&amp;showxref">Rev 16:3, 4</a>. The plural 'bloods' is used because all forms of iniquity 
and abomination well up out of hatred, just as all forms of good and holiness do out of love. Anyone therefore who hates his neighbour would murder him if he could, and he does do so in whatever 
way he can. That is to say, he does him violence, which is strictly the meaning here of 'voice of blood'.<A name="fntext1"></a><A href="#fn1"><sup>a</sup></a>

Quod 'vox sanguinum' significet violentiam illatam charitati, constat a pluribus in Verbo; in quo 'vox' accipitur pro omni quod accusat, et 'sanguis' pro omni peccato, imprimis pro odio; nam qui odio 
habet fratrem, corde suo eum occidit, ut Dominus docet, 	Audivistis quod veteribus dictum sit, Non occides; quisquis autem occiderit, obnoxius erit judicio; Ego vero dico vobis, quod quisquis irascitur 
fratri suo temere, obnoxius erit judicio; quicumque vero dixerit fratri suo, Raka, obnoxius erit synedrio; quicumque autem dixerit, Stulte, obnoxius erit gehennae ignis, Matth. v 21, 22; </p>
<p>per quae 
intelliguntur odii gradus; odium est contrarium charitati; et si non manu, usque animo, et quocumque modo possit, occidit; sunt modo vincula externa quae inhibent ne manu; quare omne odium est sanguis; 
ut apud Jeremiam, 	Quid bonam facis viam tuam ad quaerendum amorem?... etiam in alis tuis inventi sunt sanguis animarum egenorum innocentium, ii 33, 34. [2]	Et quia odium est 'sanguis,' omnis iniquitas 
est sanguis, nam fons omnium iniquitatum est odium; ut apud Hosheam, 	Pejerare, et mentiri, et occidere, et furari, et adulterari, latrocinantur, et sanguines in sanguinibus attigerunt; propterea 
lugebit terra, et contabescet omnis habitans in ea, iv 2, 3; </p>
<p>et apud Ezechielem, 	Num judicabis urbem sanguinum, et notifices ei omnes abominationes ejus?... urbs effundens sanguines in medio sui,... 
per sanguinem tuum, quem effudisti, rea facta es, Xxii 2-4, 6, 9; </p>
<p>ubi agitur de immisericordia: apud eundem, 	Terra plena est judicio sanguinum, et urbs plena est 	violentia, vii 23; </p>
<p>et apud 
Jeremiam, 	Ob peccata prophetarum Hierosolymae iniquitates sacerdotum ejus, effundentium in medio ejus sanguinem justorum, vagantur caeci in plateis, polluti sunt sanguine, 	Thren. iv 13, 14: </p>
<p>apud 
Esaiam, 	Cum abluet Dominus sordes filiarum Zionis, et sanguines Hierosolymae deterserit e medio, spiritu judicii, et spiritu combustionis, lv 4: </p>
<p>apud eundem, 	Volae vestrae pollutae sunt in sanguine, 
et digiti vestri in iniquitate, lix 3: </p>
<p>apud Ezechielem, 	Praeterivi praeter te, vidique te conculcatam in sanguinibus tuis, et dixi tibi, In sanguinibus tuis vive; et dixit tibi, in sanguinibus 
tuis vive, xvi 6, 22; </p>
<p>ubi de abominationibus Hierosolymae, quae vocantur 'sanguines,' agitur.  Immisericordia et odium ultimorum temporum describitur etiam per 'sanguinem' in Apoc. xvi 3, 4. Sanguines 
in plurali dicuntur quia omnia iniqua et abominabilia scaturiunt ex odio, sicut omnia bona et sancta ex amore; qui itaque odio habet proximum, eum si posset, occidit, et quocumque modo potest, occidit; 
quod est violentiam ei inferre, quae hic per 'vocem sanguinum' proprie significatur. </p>
