<h3 align="center" class="ired">属天的奥秘 第4538节</h3>
<h4 align="center"></h4><p><strong>4538.</strong>“神对雅各说”表对属世良善的觉知，就是从神性那里得来、现由“雅各”来代表的那种良善。这从“说”在圣言历史中的含义，以及“雅各”的代表清楚可知：“说”是指发觉（<a href="1602.htm">1602</a>，<a href="1791.htm">1791</a>，<a href="1815.htm">1815</a>，<a href="1822.htm">1822</a>，<a href="1898.htm">1898</a>，<a href="1919.htm">1919</a>，<a href="2061.htm">2061</a>，<a href="2080.htm">2080</a>，<a href="2238.htm">2238</a>，<a href="2260.htm">2260</a>，<a href="2619.htm">2619</a>，<a href="2862.htm">2862</a>，<a href="3395.htm">3395</a>，<a href="3509.htm">3509</a>节），因此，“神说”表示出于神性发觉；此处“雅各”在至高意义上是指属世良善方面的主。前几节已说明，雅各在圣言中代表什么；但由于他的代表不断变化，故在此简要解释一下他的代表。<br />就至高意义而言，雅各一般代表主的神性属世层。但当主荣耀祂的属世层时，在荣耀的过程中，该属世层在开始不同于它在期间和结束的样子。因此，雅各的代表不断发生变化。也就是说，在荣耀过程的开始，他代表真理方面的主之属世层；在荣耀过程期间，他代表真理之良善方面的主之属世层；在荣耀过程的结束，他代表良善方面的主之属世层。因为主的荣耀是从真理发展到真理之良善，最后发展到良善，这在前面已多次说明。该过程的结束就是现在的主题，“雅各”代表属世良善方面的主。可参看前面有关这些问题的说明，也就是说，就至高意义而言，雅各在荣耀过程的开始，代表真理方面的主之神性属世层（<a href="3305.htm">3305</a>，<a href="3509.htm">3509</a>，<a href="3525.htm">3525</a>，<a href="3546.htm">3546</a>，<a href="3576.htm">3576</a>，<a href="3599.htm">3599</a>节）；在荣耀过程期间，代表真理之良善方面的主之神性属世层（<a href="3659.htm">3659</a>，<a href="3669.htm">3669</a>，<a href="3677.htm">3677</a>，<a href="4234.htm">4234</a>，<a href="4273.htm">4273</a>，<a href="4337.htm">4337</a>节）。雅各现在代表良善方面的主之神性属世层，至于原因，如前所述，这是荣耀过程的结束。<br />这就是当主使祂的属世层变成神性时所发生的过程，当主重生人时，类似过程也会发生；因为主乐意按照祂使人变新时所遵循的次序使祂的人身变成神性。正因如此，我们反复说明，人的重生就是主荣耀的形像（<a href="3138.htm">3138</a>，<a href="3212.htm">3212</a>，<a href="3296.htm">3296</a>，<a href="3490.htm">3490</a>，<a href="4402.htm">4402</a>节）。当主使人变新时，祂首先给他提供信之真理，因为没有信之真理，人就不知道主是谁，天堂是什么，地狱是什么，甚至不知道它们的存在；更不知道关于主、祂在天上的国度和在地上的国度，就是教会的无数事物；也不知道这些的对立面，也就是地狱事物的特征和性质。<br />他在获知这些事之前，不可能知道何为良善。“良善”不是指世俗的良善和道德的良善，因为这些在世上通过法律法规，以及反思人的道德、习俗和习惯就能得知，这就是为何教会外的外邦人也知道这类事。“良善”是指属灵良善，属灵良善在圣言中被称为仁爱；该良善一般是指向他人意愿并行出良善，但不是为了自私的理由，而是出于快乐和对行善的情感。该良善是属灵的良善，若不通过主通过圣言和圣言的布道所教导的信之真理，没有人能获得这良善。<br />人被供给信之真理，得到教导后，就逐渐被主引导意愿真理，并出于意愿它而将其付诸实践。这个真理就被称为真理之良善，因为真理之良善就是存在于意愿和行为中的真理；它之所以被称为真理之良善，是因为一直属教义的真理现在变得属生活了。最后，当此人在意愿良善并出于意愿而实践良善中感觉到快乐时，它就不再称作真理之良善，而是称作良善了。因为现在他重生了，不再出于真理意愿并行出良善，而是出于良善意愿并实践真理；现在他所实践的真理也可以说是良善，因为该真理从它的起源，也就是良善那里获得其本质。综上所述，明显可知“雅各”在至高意义上代表良善方面的主之属世层是什么意思，还可知这种代表源于何处。“雅各”在此之所以代表这良善，是因为就内义而言，现在所论述的主题是进一步的发展，也就是说，朝向属世层的内在事物（这些事物由“以色列”来表示，<a href="4536.htm">4536</a>节）的发展。凡正被主重生之人，在他里面的真理变成良善之前，都无法被引入这些内在事物。</p>

And God said unto Jacob. That this signifies the perception of natural good, such as Jacob now represents, from the Divine, is evident from the signification in the historicals of the Word of "to say," 
as being to perceive (n. 1602, 1791, 1815, 1822, 1898, 1919, 2061, 2080, 2238, 2260, 2619, 2862, 3395, 3509), wherefore that "God said" denotes perception from the Divine; and from the representation 
of Jacob, who here in the supreme sense is the Lord as to natural good. In the preceding pages it has been shown what Jacob represents in the Word; and as he represents various things, the subject 
shall be briefly explained. [2] In the supreme sense Jacob represents in general the Lord's Divine natural. But as the Lord glorified His natural, it was different in the beginning from what it was in 
the progression, and at the end. Therefore Jacob represented various things, namely, in the beginning the Lord's natural as to truth, in the progression the Lord's natural as to the good of truth, and 
at the end the Lord's natural as to good. For the Lord's glorification proceeded from truth to the good of truth, and finally to good, as has already been frequently shown. Now as this is the end, 
Jacob represents the Lord as to natural good. (See what has already been shown on these points, namely, that in the supreme sense Jacob represents the Lord's Divine natural, in the beginning as to truth, 
n. 3305, 3509, 3525, 3546, 3576, 3599; and in the progression, the Lord's Divine natural as to the good of truth, n. 3659, 3669, 3677, 4234, 4273, 4337.) The reason why Jacob now represents the Lord's 
Divine natural as to good, is that this is the end, as before said.  [3] This was the process when the Lord made His natural Divine, and the process is similar also when the Lord regenerates man; 
for it pleased the Lord to make His Human Divine in the same order as that in which He makes man new. It is for this reason that it has been repeatedly stated that man's regeneration is an image of 
the Lord's glorification (n. 3138, 3212, 3296, 3490, 4402). When the Lord makes man new He first instructs him in the truths of faith, for without the truths of faith man does not know what the Lord is, 
what heaven is, and what hell is, nor even that they exist; and still less does he know the innumerable things relating to the Lord, to His kingdom in heaven, and to His kingdom on earth, that is, 
to the church; neither does he know what and of what nature are the things opposite to these, which relate to hell. [4] Before he has learned these things, he cannot know what good is, by which is not 
meant civil good and moral good, for these are learned in the world by means of laws and statutes, and by reflections upon the morals of men, and therefore the nations outside the church also know such 
things; but by good is meant spiritual good, which good is called in the Word charity; and this good is in general to will and do good to others for no selfish reason, but from the delight of the 
affection. This good is spiritual good, and to it no man can attain except by means of the truths of faith, which are taught by the Lord by means of the Word and preachings of the Word. [5] After a man 
has been instructed in the truths of faith, he is gradually led by the Lord to will the truth, and also from willing to do it. This truth is called the good of truth, for the good of truth is truth 
in will and act; and it is called the good of truth because the truth which has been of doctrine then becomes of the life. At last, when the man perceives delight in willing good and in doing it from 
will, it is no longer called the good of truth, but good; for he is then regenerate, and no more wills and does good from truth, but truth from good; and the truth which he then does is also as it were 
good, for it derives its essence from its origin, which is good. From all this it is evident why and whence it is that Jacob in the supreme sense represents the Lord's natural as to good. The reason 
why Jacob here represents this good, is that in the internal sense further progress is now treated of, namely, toward the interior things of the natural, which are "Israel" (n. 4536). No one who is 
being regenerated by the Lord can be led to these interior things until the truth with him has become good. </p>

<p align="center"><b>Elliott(1983-1999) 4538</b></p><p><b>4538.</b>
'God said to Jacob' means the perception which the kind of natural good that 'Jacob' now represents received from the Divine. This is clear from the meaning of 'saying' in historical descriptions in 
the Word as perceiving, dealt with in <a href="1602.htm">1602</a>, <a href="1791.htm">1791</a>, <a href="1815.htm">1815</a>, <a href="1822.htm">1822</a>, <a href="1898.htm">1898</a>, <a href="1919.htm">1919</a>, <a href="2061.htm">2061</a>, <a href="2080.htm">2080</a>, <a href="2238.htm">2238</a>, <a href="2260.htm">2260</a>, <a href="2619.htm">2619</a>, <a href="2862.htm">2862</a>, <a href="3395.htm">3395</a>, <a href="3509.htm">3509</a>, so that 'God said' means perception received from the Divine; and from the representation 
of 'Jacob' in the highest sense here as the Lord as regards natural good. Jacob's representation in the Word has been shown in previous sections; but because it is varying, his representation 
must be discussed briefly here. </p>
<p></p>
<p><b>[2]</b>
 In the highest sense 'Jacob' represents in general the Lord's Divine Natural. But the Lord's Natural, when He glorified it, was different at the beginning of 
the process of glorification from what it was during this and at the end of it; and this is why Jacob's representation was varying. That is to say, at the beginning of the process the Lord's Natural 
as regards truth is represented by him, during that process the Lord's Natural as regards the good of truth, and at the end of it as regards good. For the Lord's glorification advanced from truth to the 
good of truth, and finally to good, as shown many times in what has gone before. The end of the process being the subject at present, 'Jacob' represents the Lord as regards natural good. See what has 
been shown already about these matters, that is to say, about Jacob's representation in the highest sense - how at the beginning of the process he represents the Lord's Divine Natural as regards truth, <a href="3305.htm">3305</a>, <a href="3509.htm">3509</a>, <a href="3525.htm">3525</a>, <a href="3546.htm">3546</a>, <a href="3576.htm">3576</a>' <a href="3599.htm">3599</a>, during it the Lord's Divine Natural as regards the good of truth, <a href="3659.htm">3659</a>, <a href="3669.htm">3669</a>, <a href="3677.htm">3677</a>, <a href="4234.htm">4234</a>, <a href="4273.htm">4273</a>, <a href="4337.htm">4337</a>. But now he represents the Lord's Divine Natural as regards 
good, for the reason, as stated, that it is the end of the process. </p>
<p></p>
<p><b>[3]</b>
 Such was the process which took place when the Lord made His Natural Divine. A similar process also takes place when the Lord 
regenerates man, for when the Lord made His Human Divine He was pleased to do things in the same sequence as He does when He makes man new. This explains why it has been stated frequently that man's 
regeneration is an image of the Lord's glorification, <a href="3138.htm">3138</a>, <a href="3212.htm">3212</a>, <a href="3296.htm">3296</a>, <a href="3490.htm">3490</a>, <a href="4402.htm">4402</a>. When the Lord makes man new He first of all supplies him with the truths of faith, for without the truths of faith 
he does not know who the Lord is, what heaven is, or what hell is; he does not even know of their existence, let alone of the countless things which have to do with the Lord, His kingdom in heaven, and 
His kingdom on earth, which is the Church. Nor does he know the identity or nature of the opposite of these, namely the things of hell. </p>
<p></p>
<p><b>[4]</b>
 Until he does know these things no one can know what good 
is. The word 'good' is not used to mean the public good or the good of the individual, for one can learn in the world about these through laws and regulations and through reflection on human customs 
and habits, which is why gentiles outside the Church know such things too. 'Good' is a word used to mean spiritual good, which in the Word is called charity, and this good in general implies willing 
and doing to another that which is good not for any selfish reason but out of delight and affection for doing it. This good is spiritual good, which no one can possibly arrive at except through the 
truths of faith, which are taught by the Lord through the Word and regular preaching of the Word. </p>
<p></p>
<p><b>[5]</b>
 Once a person has been supplied with the truths of faith he is then gradually led by the Lord to 
will the truth, and from willing it to putting it into practice. This truth is called the good of truth, for that good is truth present in will and action and is called the good of truth because truth 
which has been a matter of doctrine now becomes a matter of life. When at length the person takes delight in willing good and so putting it into practice, it is no longer called the good of truth, 
but simply good. For now he is regenerate, and it is no longer truth leading him to will and do what is good, but good moving him to will and put truth into practice. And the truth now practiced by him 
is also so to speak good, since that truth derives its essential being from that in which it originates - in good. From all this one may see what is meant by the statement that in the highest sense 
'Jacob' represents the Lord's Natural as regards good, and one may see where that representation has its origin. The reason why 'Jacob' here represents this good is that the subject now in the internal 
sense is further advances, that is to say, advances made into more interior parts of the natural, which are meant by 'Israel', <a href="4536.htm">4536</a>. No one who is being regenerated by the Lord can be led to those more 
interior things until the truth present with him has become good. </p>

`Dixit Deus ad Jacobum': quod significet perceptionem naturalis boni quale nunc `Jacobus,' ex Divino, constat ex significatione `dicere' in historicis Verbi quod sit percipere, de qua n. 1602, 1791, 
1815, 1822, 1898, 1919, 2061, 2080, 2238, 2260, 2619, 2862, 3395, 3509; inde est quod `dixit Deus' sit perceptio ex Divino; et ex repraesentatione `Jacobi' quod hic in supremo sensu sit Dominus 
quoad naturale bonum: in praecedentibus ostensum (o)est quid Jacob in Verbo repraesentat, et quia sunt varia, paucis dicendum quomodo res se habet: [2] Jacob in supremo sensu in genere repraesentat 
Domini Divinum Naturale; sed quia cum Dominus Naturale Suum glorificavit illud fuit aliud in principio quam in progressu et (o)in fine, ideo `Jacob' varia repraesentavit, nempe in principio Domini 
Naturale quoad verum, in progressu Domini Naturale quoad veri bonum, et in fine quoad bonum; glorificatio enim Domini processit a vero ad veri bonum, et denique ad bonum, quod in antecedentibus pluries 
ostensum est; nunc quia in fine est, repraesentat `Jacob' Dominum quoad naturale bonum; videantur quae prius de his ostensa sunt, nempe quod `Jacob' in supremo sensu repraesentet Domini Divinum 
Naturale; in principio quoad verum, n. 3305, 3509, 3525, (x)3546, 3576, 3599; in progressu Domini Divinum Naturale quoad veri bonum, n. 3659, 3669, 3677, 4234, 4273, 4337; </p>
<p>quod nunc repraesentet 
Domini (o)Divinum Naturale quoad bonum, est quia in fine est, (o)ut dictum: [3] ille processus {1} fuit cum Dominus Naturale Suum Divinum fecit; similis etiam processus est cum Dominus hominem regenerat; 
nam placuit Domino Humanum Suum Divinum facere eo ordine quo Ipse hominem novum facit; inde est quod aliquoties dictum quod regeneratio hominis sit imago glorificationis Domini, n. 3138, 3212, 
3296, 3490, 4402, cum Dominus hominem novum facit, primum instruit illum in veris fidei, nam absque veris fidei non scit quid Dominus, quid caelum, et quid infernum, ne quidem quod sint, minus 
innumerabilia quae Domini sunt, quae Ipsius regni in caelo, quaeque Ipsius regni in terra, hoc est, in Ecclesia; tum quae et qualia sunt illa quae (c)illis opposita quae sunt inferni; [4] antequam 
haec novit, non scire potest quid bonum; per bonum non intelligitur bonum civile et bonum morale, nam haec in mundo discuntur per leges et statuta et per reflexiones super mores hominum, inde est 
quod gentes quae extra Ecclesiam talia quoque sciant; sed per bonum intelligitur bonum spirituale, quod bonum in Verbo vocatur charitas, estque hoc bonum in genere velle et facere alteri bonum ex nulla 
causa sui, sed ex jucundo affectionis; hoc bonum est bonum spirituale; ad hoc nusquam aliquis homo venire potest quam per vera fidei, quae docentur a Domino per Verbum et praedicationes Verbi; 
[5] postquam homo instructus est in veris fidei, dein per gradus ducitur ille a Domino ad velle verum, et quoque ex velle facere illud; hoc verum vocatur veri bonum, nam veri bonum est verum voluntate 
et actu, et dicitur veri bonum quia verum quod fuit doctrinae, tunc fit vitae.  Tandem cum homo appercipit jucundum in velle bonum et inde facere illud, non amplius dicitur {2} veri bonum, sed 
bonum, nam tunc regeneratus est, et non magis ex vero vult et facit bonum, sed ex bono verum, et verum quod tunc facit, (t)est etiam (o)quasi bonum, nam {3} ex origine sua quae est bonum, trahit suam 
essentiam.  Ex his patet quid sit et unde sit quod `Jacob' in supremo sensu repraesentet Domini Naturale quoad bonum: quod hic Jacob repraesentet hoc bonum, est quia nunc in sensu interno agitur 
de ulteriore progressione, nempe versus interiora naturalis, quae sunt `Israel,' n. 4536; nemo qui {4} regeneratur a Domino, perduci potest ad interiora priusquam verum apud illum factum est bonum {5}.
