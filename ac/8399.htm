<h3 align="center" class="ired">属天的奥秘 第8399节</h3>
<h4 align="center"></h4><p><strong>8399.</strong>“以琳和西乃中间”表一个延续及其本质。这从“以琳”和“西乃”的含义清楚可知，由此可见在这二者之间的位置表示什么。由于水泉和棕树在以琳，所以“以琳”表示属于试探后的安慰的真理和良善（参看前一章最后一节）；由于律法是在西乃山宣布的，所以“西乃”表示良善和从该良善流出的真理。因此，“汛”所表示的延续和本质是来自真理的良善。来自真理的良善是属灵人在重生之前所行出的良善，因为那时，他出于真理行良善，也就是说，由于真理就是如此要求的，所以他出于顺从而这样做。但真理所来自的良善是属灵人在重生之后所行的良善，因为那时他出于情感而行良善。前一种良善由“汛”来表示，后一种良善由“西乃”来表示。</p>

Which is between Elim and Sinai. That this signifies what is continuous and its quality, is evident from the signification of "Elim," and from the signification of "Sinai," from which it is clear what 
that which is "between" signifies. For "Elim," from the fountains and palm-trees which were there, signifies the truth and good that belong to consolation after temptation (see the last verse of the 
preceding chapter); and "Sinai," from the law which was there promulgated, signifies good and the derivative truth; consequently what is continuous and the quality that is signified by "Sin," are the 
good that is from truth. The good that is from truth is the good that is in the spiritual man before regeneration, for he then does good from truth, that is, because it has been so commanded, consequently 
from obedience; whereas the good from which is truth is the good which is in the spiritual man after regeneration, for he then does good from affection. The former good is signified by "Sin," the 
latter by "Sinai." </p>

'Which is between Elim and Sinai' means a continuation and the essential nature. This is clear from the meaning of 'Elim' and from the meaning of 'Sinai', from which one may see what this location between 
the two means. Because of the springs and palm trees that were there 'Elim' means truth and good that belong to comfort after temptation - see the final verse of the previous chapter. And because 
of the Law which was declared from it 'Sinai' means good and the truth that flows from it. Consequently the continuation and the essential nature meant by 'Sin' is good that results from truth. Good 
that results from truth is the good done by a spiritual person prior to regeneration; for at that time he does it as a result of truth, that is, because truth demands it, and therefore he does it in 
a spirit of obedience. But good from which truth flows is done by a spiritual person after regeneration, for now he does it as a result of his affection for it. The former kind of good is meant by 'Sin', 
the latter by 'Sinai'. </p>

`Quod inter Elim et inter Sinai': quod significet continuum et quale, constat ex significatione `Elim' et ex significatione `Sinai,' ex quibus {1}liquet quid hoc intermedium significat; `Elim' enim, 
ex fontibus et palmis quae ibi, significat verum et bonum quae sunt consolationis post tentationem, videatur versus ultimus capitis praecedentis, et `Sinai,' ex lege quae ibi promulgata est, significat 
bonum et inde verum; inde continuum et quale quod per `Sin' significatur est bonum quod ex vero.  Bonum quod ex vero est bonum quod apud spiritualem hominem est ante regenerationem, nam tunc (t)facit 
bonum ex vero, hoc est, quia ita mandatum est, proinde ex oboedientia; at bonum ex quo verum est bonum quod apud (t)spiritualem hominem est post regenerationem, nam tunc bonum facit ex affectione; prius 
bonum significatur per `Sin,' posterius per `Sinai.' 	@1 After significat$ </p>
