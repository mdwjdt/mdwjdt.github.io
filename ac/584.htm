And Jehovah saw that the evil of the people in the land multiplied; and everything that the thoughts of their heart fabricated was nothing but evil every day.<br />Jehovah saw that the evil of the people in the land multiplied means that the will for good began to disappear. Every fabrication of the thoughts of their heart was nothing but evil every day means that there was no perception of truth or goodness. </p>

Verse 5. And Jehovah saw that the evil of man was multiplied in the earth, and that all the imagination of the thoughts of his heart was only evil every day. "Jehovah saw that the evil of man was multiplied 
on the earth" signifies that there began to be no will of good; "all the imagination of the thoughts of his heart was only evil every day" signifies that there was no perception of truth and good. </p>

<p align="center"><b>Elliott(1983-1999) 584</b></p><p><b>584.</b>
Verse 5 And Jehovah saw that the evil of man had been increased on the earth, and all the imagination of the thoughts of his heart was altogether evil all the day long.  </p>
<p>'Jehovah saw that the evil 
of man had been increased on the earth' means that the will for good started to go out of existence. 'All the imagination of the thoughts of his heart was altogether evil all the day long' means that 
there was no perception of truth and good.  </p>

</p><b>584.</b>
Vers. 5.  Et vidit Jehovah, quod multiplicatum malum hominis in terra; et omne figmentum cogitationum cordis ejus solummodo malum omni die. 'Quod viderit Jehovah, quod multiplicatum malum hominis in 
terra' significat quod voluntas boni inceperit nulla esse: 'omne figmentum cogitationum cordis solummodo malum omni die' significat quod nulla perceptio veri et boni. </p>
