<h4 align="center"></h4><p><h4 align="center">内义</h4><br />1540.如前所述，在圣言中，真实的历史始于前一章，即第十二章。在此之前，确切地说，直到希伯，它们都是虚构的历史。此处亚伯兰故事的延续在内义上表示主，尤表祂最初的生命，就是祂的外在人与内在人结合，以至于行如一体，即祂的外在人也变成属天和神性之前的生命。代表主的是历史细节，而这些话本身是指那些所代表之物。但由于是历史，所以读者的头脑不可避免地局限于历史。尤其是现在，绝大多数人，甚至几乎所有人都不相信内义的存在，更不相信每句话都具有内义。恐怕他们都不承认它的存在，即便这内义明明白白地显示出来。还有一个原因是，内义似乎与字义相去甚远，以至于难以辨别。然而，他们仅从以下事实就能知道，这些历史不可能是圣言：即若剥离内义，它们和其它历史一样，毫无神性可言；而正是内义使得圣言成为神性。内义是圣言本身，这从已揭示的很多事物清楚可知，如：<br />我从埃及召出我的儿子来。（马太福音<a href="http://39-27.cn/太2.15.htm">2:15</a>）<br />象这样的经文还有很多。主复活后亲自教导门徒有关摩西书和先知书中指着祂自己所写的内容（路加福音<a href="http://39-27.cn/路24.27.htm">24:27</a>），因此，圣言中所写的事没有一样不涉及祂、祂的国度和教会。这些是圣言的属灵和属天之物，但字义绝大部分是由世俗、肉体和尘世之物构成，它们不可能构成主的圣言。如今的人们都有这样的特点，除了这类事物外，他们感知不到任何事物，甚至几乎不知道何为属灵和属天之物。上古教会和古教会的成员则不然。他们若生活在今天并阅读圣言，根本就不注意字义，他们会视之为无有，而只关注内义。若有人以其它方式来领悟圣言，他们必大为惊讶。因此，古人的所有书籍皆以这种风格写就，以至于它们的内义不同于字义。</p><br />

Up to that point 钬?or rather up to Eber's story 钬?it was fiction.<br />The continuing story of Abram here symbolizes the Lord, in an inner sense. Specifically, it symbolizes his early life and what this was like before his outer self united with his inner self to form a single entity, that is, before his outer self likewise became heavenly and divine.<br />The historical events are what represent the Lord; the actual words symbolize the things represented.<br />Because it is a history, though, readers cannot help fixing their attention on those events. This is especially true today, when few if any believe that an inner meaning exists, let alone that it permeates every single word. Perhaps they will still fail to acknowledge an inner sense, even when it has been so clearly demonstrated. Part of the reason may also be that the deeper meaning appears to depart so radically from the literal meaning that it can hardly be recognized. But the reader can see [that there is such a meaning] simply by considering the fact that the historical details cannot possibly be Scripture, since in isolation from any inner meaning they contain no more divinity than other stories do. The deeper sense is what makes the narrative divine.<br />[2] The inner meaning is the real Word, as much of revelation discloses. One example is the statement, "Out of Egypt I called my child" (<a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_1540/bible_king-james-version_matthew_2_15" target=_top>Matthew 2:15</a>),{*1} and there are many others besides. After his resurrection, the Lord himself also taught his disciples what it was that Moses and the prophets had written about him (<a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_1540/bible_king-james-version_luke_24_27" target=_top>Luke 24:27</a>). In doing so, he showed them that nothing is written in the Word that does not focus on him, his kingdom, and the church. These are the spiritual and heavenly subjects of the Word. What the literal meaning contains is worldly, bodily, and earthly, for the most part, and could never constitute the Lord's Word.<br />Modern people are such that this dimension is all they perceive; what the spiritual and heavenly dimension is they scarcely know. Not so the people of the earliest church and the ancient church. Had they lived today and read the Word, they would have paid no attention to the literal meaning (which they would view as insignificant) but only to the deeper meaning. They are stunned that anyone could perceive the Word in any other way. For this reason, all the books of the ancients were written to express something different in an inner sense than in the literal sense.<br /><br /><strong>Footnotes:</strong><br />{*1} "Out of Egypt I called my child" is a passage from <a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_1540/bible_king-james-version_hosea_11_1" target=_top>Hosea 11:1</a> that is quoted in <a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_1540/bible_king-james-version_matthew_2_15" target=_top>Matthew 2:15</a>. In its original use and in the literal sense, it refers to God's summons to the Israelites after the centuries they spent in Egypt. In <a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_1540/bible_king-james-version_matthew_2_15" target=_top>Matthew 2:15</a>, however, it is understood to be a prophecy concerning Jesus.

THE INTERNAL SENSE The true historicals of the Word began, as before said, with the foregoing chapter-the twelfth. Up to that point, or rather to Eber, they were made-up historicals. In the internal 
sense, the historicals here continued respecting Abram are significative of the Lord, and in fact of His first life, such as it was before His external man had been conjoined with the internal so as 
to make one thing; that is, before His external man had been in like manner made celestial and Divine. The historicals are what represent the Lord; the words themselves are significative of the things 
that are represented. But being historical, the mind of the reader cannot but be held in them; especially at this day, when most persons, and indeed nearly all, do not believe that there is an internal 
sense, and still less that it exists in every word; and it may be that in spite of the fact that the internal sense has been so plainly shown thus far, they will not even now acknowledge its existence, 
and this for the reason that the internal sense appears to recede so far from the sense of the letter as to be scarcely recognized in it. And yet that these historicals cannot be the Word they might 
know from the mere fact that when separated from the internal sense there is no more of the Divine in them than in any other history; whereas the internal sense makes the Word to be Divine.  [2] 
That the internal sense is the Word itself, is evident from many things that have been revealed, as, "Out of Egypt have I called My son" (Matt. 2:15); besides many others. The Lord Himself also, after 
His resurrection, taught the disciples what had been written concerning Him in Moses and the Prophets (Luke 24:27); and thus that there is nothing written in the Word that does not regard Him, His kingdom, 
and the church. These are the spiritual and celestial things of the Word; but the things contained in the literal sense are for the most part worldly, corporeal, and earthly; which cannot possibly 
make the Word of the Lord. At this day men are of such a character that they perceive nothing but such things; and what spiritual and heavenly things are, they scarcely know. It was otherwise with 
the men of the Most Ancient and of the Ancient Church, who, had they lived at this day, and had read the Word, would not have attended at all to the sense of the letter, which they would look upon as 
nothing, but to the internal sense. They wonder greatly that anyone perceives the Word in any other way. All the books of the Ancients were therefore so written as to have in their interior sense a different 
meaning from that in the letter. </p>

THE INTERNAL SENSE </p>
<p>As has been stated, narratives in the Word that draw on true history began with the previous chapter. Down to that point, or rather down to Eber, they were made-up history. The 
continuation of the Abram story here means in the internal sense the Lord and in particular His life as it was at first before His External Man had been joined to His Internal to the point of their functioning 
as a unit, that is, before His external Man as well had become celestial and Divine. The historical details are what represent the Lord, while the actual words mean those things that are being 
represented. But because they are historical descriptions the mind of the reader. inevitably dwells upon them, especially nowadays when the majority, indeed almost everybody, does not believe in the 
existence of an internal sense at all, let alone within individual words. And perhaps they will still not acknowledge the existence of it even though it has been shown so clearly up to this point. There 
is the further reason that the internal sense seems to be so withdrawn from the sense of the letter that it is scarcely recognizable. Yet they can know of it merely from the consideration that historical 
records by themselves cannot ever constitute the Word, for there is no more of the Divine in them when they are separated from the internal sense than in any other historical narrative. It is 
the internal sense that makes it Divine. The fact that the internal sense is the Word itself is clear from many things that have been revealed, such as </p>
<blockquote>
Out of Egypt have I called My son. <a href="http://bible.gospelcom.net/cgi-bin/bible?passage=Matt%202:15&amp;version=ESV&amp;interface=print&amp;showfn=yes&amp;showxref">Matt 2:15</a>. 
</blockquote>
<p>besides 
many others like this. The Lord Himself also, after the Resurrection, taught the disciples what had been written concerning Himself in Moses and the Prophets, <a href="http://bible.gospelcom.net/cgi-bin/bible?passage=Luke%2024:27&amp;version=ESV&amp;interface=print&amp;showfn=yes&amp;showxref">Luke 24:27</a>, thus that nothing 
has been written in the Word which does not have regard to Him, to His kingdom, and to the Church. These are the spiritual and celestial things of the Word, but the sense of the letter consists for 
the most part of worldly, bodily, and earthly images which cannot possibly constitute the Word of the Lord. Nowadays people are such that they do not perceive anything except matters of this sort. They 
scarcely know what spiritual and celestial things are. It was different with the member of the Most Ancient Church or of the Ancient Church. If he were living today and reading the Word he would not 
pay any attention to the sense of the letter, which he would regard as nothing at all, but only to the internal sense. Members of those Churches are utterly amazed that anyone perceives the Word in 
any other way. All the books of the ancients therefore were written in such a fashion that they had a different import in the interior sense from what they had in the letter. </p>

SENSUS INTERNUS HISTORICA vera Verbi incohata sunt, ut dictum, capite praecedente xii; illuc usque seu potius ad Eberum fuerunt historica facta: quae nunc de Abramo continuantur, in sensu interno significant 
Dominum, et quidem primam Ipsius vitam qualis fuit antequam Externus Ipsius Homo conjunctus fuit cum Interno adeo ut unam rem agerent, hoc est, antequam Externus Ipsius Homo similiter caelestis 
et Divinus factus sit. Historica sunt quae Dominum repraesentant, ipsa verba sunt significativa illorum quae repraesentantur: sed quia historica sunt, mens legentis non aliter potest quam teneri 
in illis, cumprimis hodie cum plerique et fere omnes non credant dari sensum internum, minus in singulis verbis; et forte nec agnitum adhuc, tametsi ita manifeste huc usque ostensum est; ex eo quoque, 
quod sensus internus appareat ita recedere a sensu litterae ut vix cognoscatur; sed scire possunt solum inde quod historica nusquam possint esse Verbum, quia in illis separatis a sensu interno non plus 
Divini est quam in alio quodam historico; at sensus internus facit ut Divinum sit. Quod sensus internus sit ipsum Verbum, constat a multis quae revelata sunt, ut Ex Aegypto vocavi filium Meum, Matth. 
ii 15; </p>
<p>praeter plura alia; Ipse etiam Dominus post Resurrectionem docuit discipulos quid apud Mosen et Prophetas scriptum fuisset de Ipso: Luc. xxiv 27, ita quod nihil in Verbo scriptum quod non 
Ipsum spectet: Ipsius regnum, et Ecclesiam; haec sunt spiritualia et caelestia Verbi; at quae sensus litterae habet, sunt utplurimum mundana, corporea, et terrestria, quae nusquam facere possunt Verbum 
Domini. Hodie tales sunt ut nihil nisi quam talia percipiant; quid spiritualia et caelestia, vix sciunt; aliter quam talia percipiant; quid spiritualia et caelestia, vix sciunt; aliter Antiquissimae 
et Antiquae Ecclesiae homo, qui si hodie vixisset et legisset Verbum, nihil attenderet ad sensum litterae: quem videret sicut nullum, sed ad sensum internum; mirantur valde quod aliquis aliter percipiat 
Verbum: quare etiam omnes antiquorum libri ita scripti sunt ut aliter ferrent in sensu interiore quam in littera. </p>
