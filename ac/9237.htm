<h3 align="center" class="ired">属天的奥秘 第9237节</h3>
<h4 align="center"></h4><p><strong>9237.</strong>灵人和天使都知道连月球也有居民，因为他们常与他们交谈；绕木星和土星旋转的月球或卫星上同样有人居住。那些没有见过他们或与他们交谈的人也毫不怀疑这些卫星上也有人，因为它们同样是陆地星球；哪里有陆地星球，哪里就有人；因为每个陆地星球都是为人而造的；并且至高无上的造物主无论造什么东西，都是有目的的。凡理解思考的人都能看出，创造的目的就是人类，以便天堂能从人类形成。天使还说，一个没有人类的陆地星球是不可能存在的，因为神在一个星球上所提供的一切都是为了人。</p>

That there are inhabitants in the Moon also, is known to spirits and angels, for they often speak with them; and in like manner that there are inhabitants in the moons or satellites which revolve about 
the planet Jupiter and the planet Saturn. Those who have not seen and spoken with them nevertheless have no doubt that there are men in them, for they too are earths; and where there is an earth, there 
is man; for man is the end for the sake of which every earth was created; and nothing has been made by the Supreme Creator without a purpose. That the end of creation is the human race, that there 
may be a heaven from it, can be seen by everyone one who thinks from reason. The angels also say that an earth cannot subsist apart from the human race, because the Divine provides all things on an 
earth for the sake of man. </p>

<p align="center"><b>Elliott(1983-1999) 9237</b></p><p><b>9237.</b>
Spirits and angels know that even the moon has inhabitants, for they often talk to them, and that the moons or satellites around the planet Jupiter and the planet Saturn are likewise inhabited. Those 
who have not seen them or talked to them nevertheless have no doubt that there are people on those moons also, since they are equally terrestrial bodies. And where a terrestrial body exists, so does 
the human being; for the human being is the end for the sake of which a terrestrial body exists, and the Supreme Being has created nothing without that end in view. Anyone who thinks rationally can see 
that the end for which creation exists is the human race, in order that heaven may be formed from it. The angels also say that a terrestrial body without the human race cannot remain in existence, since 
it is for the sake of the human being that God provides everything on such a body.  </p>

<p align="center"><b>Latin(1748-1756) 9237</b>
</p><b>9237.</b>
Quod etiam in Luna sint incolae, sciunt spiritus et angeli, nam cum illis saepe loquuntur; pariter quod in lunis seu satellitibus circum tellurem Jovis et tellurem Saturni.  Qui illos non viderant, 
ac cum illis locuti sunt, usque non dubitant quin etiam in illis homines sint, quia aeque sunt tellures; et ubi tellus ibi est homo, homo enim est finis propter quem tellus, et a Summo Creatore nihil 
sine fine factum est; quod finis creationis sit humanum genus, ut ex eo caelum, cuivis qui ex ratione cogitat, constare potest; angeli etiam dicunt quod tellus absque humano genere non possit subsistere, 
quia Divinum prospicit omnia in tellure propter hominem. </p>
