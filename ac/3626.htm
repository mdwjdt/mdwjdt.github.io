<h3 align="center" class="ired">属天的奥秘 第3626节</h3>
<h4 align="center"></h4><p><strong>3626.</strong>在来世，这种对应关系的存在是众所周知的，不仅天使知晓，而且灵人，甚至恶灵也知道。天使由此知道人里面隐藏最深的奥秘，也知道尘世和整个自然界里面隐藏最深的奥秘。这一点经常通过以下事实向我显明：当我谈及人的某个部位时，他们通过自己所能追踪，并且身体具体部位的秩序所对应的天堂秩序，不仅知道该部位的整个结构，它的运行方式和所发挥的功能，还知道有关它的无数其它细节，比世人所能探究或理解的还要多。事实上，他们知道这些存在于其中的秩序，以及它们彼此关联的序列。因此，他们接触到的是事物的最初起源，所以他们知道源于这些最初起源的事物。</p>

That there is such a correspondence is perfectly well known in the other life, not only to angels, but also to spirits, and even to the wicked. Angels know from it the most hidden things in man and the 
most hidden things in the world and in its universal nature, as has very often been made manifest to me from the fact that when I spoke of any part of man, they, from their mental view into the heavenly 
order which they followed, to which the order of that part corresponded, not only knew all the structure of that part, its manner of acting and use, but likewise innumerable things besides, more 
than man is ever capable of exploring or even understanding, and this in their order and in their series. Thus being in first principles, they thence know the things which are from these. </p>

The existence of such correspondence is very well known in the next life not only to angels but also to spirits, even to evil ones. From it angels know the deepest secrets in man, and the deepest secrets 
in the world and in the whole natural order there. This has often been made clear to me from the fact that when I have spoken about some part of the human being they know not only how the whole of 
that part is structured, the way in which it functions, and the purpose it serves, but also countless other details about it, more than man is ever capable of discovering or indeed understanding. In 
fact they know the order within which these exist and the sequence in which they are related to one another. They know these things from an insight into heavenly order which they can trace and to which 
the order belonging to that particular part of the body corresponds. Thus because they are in touch with the first origins of things, they therefore know the things that spring from those first origins. </p>

<p align="center"><b>Latin(1748-1756) 3626</b>
</p><b>3626.</b>
Quod talis correspondentia sit, notissimum est in altera vita, non solum angelis sed etiam spiritibus, et quoque malis; angeli sciunt inde arcanissima quae in homine, et arcanissima quae in mundo et 
in universa ejus natura; quod saepius mihi constare potuit, etiam ex eo quod cum locutus de aliqua parte hominis, non solum scirent omnem ejus partis structuram, agendi modum et usum, sed et innumerabilia 
plura quam usquam homo capax sit explorandi, immo intelligendi, et quidem in suo ordine et in sua serie; et hoc ex intuitione in ordinem caelestem quem sequebantur, cui partis illius ordo correspondebat: 
ita, quia in principiis sunt, ea quae ex illis, inde sciunt. </p>
