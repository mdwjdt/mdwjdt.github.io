<h3 align="center" class="ired">属天的奥秘 第2740节</h3>
<h4 align="center"></h4><p><strong>2740.</strong>真正的婚姻之爱只可能存在于两个配偶之间，也就是存在于一夫一妻的婚姻中，绝无可能同时存在于多偶婚姻中。因为婚姻之爱是相互共有的，双方的生命被绑在一起，以致他们可以说合而为一。这样的结合只能存在于二者之间，而不能存在于多者之间，多者会分裂婚姻之爱。上古教会成员是属天的，和天使一样具有对善与真的直觉，故他们只有一位妻子。他们常常说，与一位妻子，他们会享有一切形式的天堂快乐和幸福，而与多个的婚姻仅仅一提及，就令他们惊恐不已。因为如前所述，一夫一妻的婚姻是从具有这种性质的善与真的婚姻，就是天上的婚姻降下来的。这从主在马太福音中的话很清楚地看出来：<br />耶稣说，难道你们没念过，那起初造人的，是造男造女，并且说，因此，人要离开父母，与妻子连合，他们二人成为一体吗？既然如此，夫妻不再是两个人，乃是一体的了。所以，神配合的，人不可分开。摩西因为你们的心硬，所以许你们休妻，但起初并不是这样。这话不是一切人都能领受的，惟独赐给谁，谁才能领受。（马太福音<a href="http://39-27.cn/太19.3.htm">19:3</a>-<a href="http://39-27.cn/太19.12.htm">12</a>）</p>

Genuine conjugial love is not possible except between two consorts, that is, in the marriage of one man with one wife, and by no means with more than one at the same time; for the reason that conjugial 
love is mutual and reciprocal, and is the alternate life of the one in the other, so that they are as it were a one. Such a union is possible between two, but not among more: more tear that love asunder. 
The men of the Most Ancient Church, who were celestial and in the perception of good and truth, like the angels, had but one wife. They said that with one wife they perceived heavenly delights 
and happiness, and that when marriage with more was merely mentioned, they were filled with horror; for as before said the marriage of one husband and one wife comes down from the marriage of good and 
truth, or from the heavenly marriage, which is of this nature, as is very evident from the Lord's words in Matthew: </p>
<p>     Jesus said, Have ye not read that He who made them from the beginning made them 
male and female, and said, For this cause shall a man leave father and mother, and shall cleave to his wife, and they twain shall be one flesh? Wherefore they are no more twain, but one flesh; what 
therefore God hath joined together, let not man put asunder. Moses, for the hardness of your heart, permitted you to put away your wives; but from the beginning it was not so. All cannot receive this 
word, save they to whom it is given (Matt. 19:3-12). </p>

<p align="center"><b>Elliott(1983-1999) 2740</b></p><p><b>2740.</b>
Genuine conjugial love is not possible except between two married to each other, that is, within the marriage of one man and one wife. It is not by any means possible when one is married simultaneously 
to many, for the reason that conjugial love is mutual and reciprocal, and the life of one partner is bound up in that of the other, and vice versa, so that they are so to speak one. Such a union is 
possible between two, but not between many; many split that love apart. Members of the Most Ancient Church, who were celestial and with whom the perception of good and truth existed as with angels, had 
only one wife. They used to say that with one wife they enjoyed every form of heavenly delight and happiness, and that the mere mention of being married to many horrified them; for the marriage of 
one husband and one wife is descended, as has been stated, from the marriage of good and truth, or the heavenly marriage, which is of such a nature, as may become quite clear from the Lord's words in 
Matthew, </p>
<blockquote>
Jesus said, Have you not read that He who made them from the beginning made them male and female, and said, For this reason a man (homo) will leave father and mother and will cling to his 
wife; and the two will become one flesh? Therefore they are no longer two, but one flesh. What therefore God has joined together let not man (homo) separate. For the hardness of your heart Moses allowed 
you to divorce your wives, but from the beginning it was not so. Not everyone receives this teaching, but those to whom it has been given. <a href="http://bible.gospelcom.net/cgi-bin/bible?passage=Matt%2019:%203-12&amp;version=ESV&amp;interface=print&amp;showfn=yes&amp;showxref">Matt 19: 3-12</a>.

Genuinus amor conjugialis non dabilis est quam inter binos conjuges, hoc est, in conjugio unius viri et unius uxoris, nusquam inter plures simul, ex causa quia amor conjugialis est mutuus et reciprocus, 
ac vita unius in alterius vicissim, sic ut quasi unum sint; talis unio datur inter binos, non autem inter plures, plures amorem illum discindunt. Antiquissimae Ecclesiae homines, qui fuerant caelestes 
ac in perceptione boni et veri sicut angeli, solum unam uxorem habuerunt; dicebant quod cum una uxore caelestes delicias et felicitates perceperint, et cum modo nominaretur conjugium plurium, quod 
horruerint: conjugium enim unius mariti et unius uxoris descendit, ut dictum {1}, a conjugio boni et veri, seu a conjugio caelesti, quod est tale, ut manifeste constare potest a Domini verbis apud 
Matthaeum, 	Jesus dixit, Annon legistis, quod is qui fecit ab initio, masculum et feminam fecit eos? et dixit, Propterea relinquet homo patrem et matrem, et adhaerebit uxori suae, et erunt duo in carnem 
unam; quare non amplius sunt duo, sed (t)caro una; quod ergo Deus copulavit, homo ne separet:... Moses ob duritiem cordis vestri permisit dimittere uxores vestras; ab initio autem non fuit ita {2}:... 
non omnes capiunt verbum hoc, sed ii quibus datum est, xix 3-12. 	@1 i supra.$ 	@2 sic.$ </p>
