<h3 align="center" class="ired">属天的奥秘 第7252节</h3>
<h4 align="center"></h4><p><strong>7252.</strong>出现在金星另一侧的金星居民和灵人具有完全不同的性质，因为他们温和、有人性。主曾允许这些灵人中的一些人从那里来到我这里；那时，他们出现在头顶附近。在与我交谈的过程中，他们说，他们在世时就承认，并且现在更是完全承认，我们的主是他们的独一神。他们说，他们曾在他们星球上看见祂在他们当中行走，还向我描绘了他们如何看见了主。</p>

The inhabitants and spirits of Venus who appear on the other side of that earth, are of an almost contrary disposition, being gentle and humane. It was granted of the Lord that some of these spirits 
should come thence to me, and then they appeared near above the head. In talking with me they said that when they were in the world they acknowledged, and now more fully acknowledge, our Lord as their 
only God. They said that in their earth they had seen Him, walking among them, and they also represented in what manner they had seen Him. </p>

The inhabitants and spirits belonging to Venus who appear on the other side of that planet are of an almost opposite nature, for they are gentle and humane. The Lord once allowed some of those spirits 
to come from there towards me; they appeared nearby overhead. They talked to me, saying that when they had been in the world they had acknowledged our Lord as their one and only God, and that they acknowledged 
Him as such even more so now. They said that on their planet they had seen Him walking among them; and they also represented to me how they had seen Him. </p>

Incolae et spiritus Veneris qui apparent ab altera parte illius telluris ex paene (x)contraria indole sunt, sunt enim mites et humani; concessum erat a Domino ut venirent aliqui ex illis spiritibus 
inde ad me, apparebant tunc prope supra caput; {1}hi mecum locuti dicebant quod cum in mundo fuerunt, agnoverint et quod magis nunc agnoscant Dominum nostrum pro suo unico Deo; dicebant quod in tellure 
sua viderint Ipsum ambulantem inter illos, et quoque quomodo Ipsum {2}viderunt, repraesentabant. 	@1 qui$ 	@2 viderint$ </p>
