<h3 align="center" class="ired">属天的奥秘 第2294节</h3>
<h4 align="center"></h4><p><strong>2294.</strong>有好几次，我与一群唱诗班的孩子们在一起。他们还很幼小，只发出一种娇嫩的、不成形的声音，所以他们尚不能像后来稍大些那样行动一致。令我惊奇的是，我周围的灵人情不自禁地试图引导他们思考和说话。这种欲望是这些灵人与生俱来的。但我经常注意到小孩子们表示抗拒，不愿那样去想去说。我常常发觉一种气愤，伴随着这种拒绝和抗拒。有一次他们当真说了话，却只是说“不是那样的”。我被告知，在来世，小孩子会经历这种试探，以训练他们不仅习惯于抗拒虚假与邪恶，还习惯于不让自己通过其他人思考、说话和行事，因而不让自己接受任何人的引导，而单单接受主的引导。</p>

Many times when children have been with me in choirs, they being as yet quite infantile, they have been heard as a tender something devoid of order, so that they did not as yet act as a one, as they 
do afterwards when they become older; and what surprised me, the spirits about me could not refrain from trying to lead them to think and to speak. Such a desire is innate in spirits. But I often noticed 
that the little children resisted, not being willing to think or speak in such a way. I have often observed this refusal and resistance attended with a kind of indignation, and when any ability to 
speak was granted them they merely said that it was not so. I have been instructed that such is the temptation of little children in the other life, to accustom and inaugurate them not only in the resisting 
of falsity and evil, but also in not allowing themselves to think, speak, and act from others, and thus in not suffering themselves to be led by any other than the Lord alone. </p>

On many occasions when young children who were still mere infants were present with me in groups (chorus) they have sounded as something gentle but without order, so that they were not yet acting as 
one in the way they would do later on when they had become more grown up. And what astonished me, the spirits present with me could not refrain from trying to direct their thought and speech. Such a desire 
comes naturally to spirits, but I have noticed every time that the young children resisted, being unwilling to think or to speak as the spirits directed. Quite often I have detected a kind of anger 
accompanying such refusal and resistance; and once they were able to say anything at all they merely said, No! I have been told that young children undergo such temptation in the next life so that 
they may become accustomed and disciplined not only to resist falsity and evil but also not to think, speak, and act from any other, and so not to allow themselves to be directed by anyone but the Lord alone. </p>

Pluries cum infantes apud me fuerunt in choris, cum adhuc prorsus infantiles essent, auditi sunt sicut tenerum inordinatum {4}, sic ut nondum sicut unum agerent quemadmodum dein cum adultiores facti; 
et quod miratus, spiritus apud me {2} non potuerunt se retinere quin eos ducerent, nempe ad cogitandum et ad loquendum {3}; innata est spiritibus talis cupido; sed observatum toties quod infantes repugnarent, 
non volentes ita cogitare nec ita loqui; renuentiam et repugnantiam cum quadam specie indignationis saepius appercepi; cumque illis datum esset aliquid copiae loquendi, dicebant modo quod (t)non 
ita' sit; instructus sum quod talis sit infantum tentatio in altera vita ut adsuescant et inaugurentur non solum ad resistendum falso et malo, sed etiam ut non ab alio cogitent, loquantur et agant, 
ita non ab alio patiantur se duci quam a solo Domino. 	@1 i quoddam.$ 	@2 qui tunc aderant.$ 	@3 i ex se.$ </p>
