<h3 align="center" class="ired">属天的奥秘 第5628节</h3>
<h4 align="center"></h4><p><strong>5628.</strong>“但愿神沙代”表苦难之后的安慰。这从“沙代”的含义清楚可知，“沙代”是指试探和试探之后的安慰（<a href="1992.htm">1992</a>，<a href="4572.htm">4572</a>节）；故在此是指他们在埃及遭受苦难之后的安慰。此处的含义，即遭受苦难之后安慰，也可从接下来的话明显看出来，即：“使你们在那人面前蒙怜悯”。“沙代”之所以表示试探和试探之后的安慰，是因为古人照着来自独一神的各种事物给独一神取了各种各样的名字；他们以为甚至连试探也来自祂，故称祂为“神沙代”。他们并未将这个名字理解为别神，只是理解为就试探而已的独一神。然而，当古教会走下坡路的时候，他们开始敬拜和独一神的名字一样多的神；事实上，还以他们自己所杜撰出来的更多名字而增加了他们的数量。这种趋势一直持续到最后每个家族都有自己的神，并且他们将这神与其他家族所敬拜的其余的神完全区分开来。<br />亚伯拉罕所属的他拉家族拜沙代为它的神明（参看<a href="1356.htm">1356</a>，<a href="1992.htm">1992</a>，<a href="2559.htm">2559</a>，<a href="3667.htm">3667</a>节）；因此，不仅亚伯拉罕，而且雅各也承认沙代为他的神；他们甚至在迦南地也承认。允许他们这样做，是为了避免他们被迫放弃自己原来的宗教信仰；因为没有人能被迫放弃他以之为神圣的东西，他们被允许持守它。然而，由于古人将“沙代”这个名理解为耶和华自己，或主，他们经历试探时就称呼这个名，所以耶和华或主在与亚伯拉罕打交道时就取这个名，这从创世记（<a href="http://39-27.cn/创17.1.htm">17:1</a>）明显看出来；在与雅各打交道时也是（创世记<a href="http://39-27.cn/创35.11.htm">35:11</a>）。<br />“沙代”之所以不仅表示试探，还表示安慰，是因为一切属灵的试探之后接下来就是安慰。我通过来世的经历得以知道这一点；在来世，当有人在恶灵手里受苦，因为他们攻击他，煽动他行恶，劝说他接受虚假，一旦恶灵被赶走，他就被天使接待，通过适合他秉性的快乐而被带入安慰的状态。</p>

And God Shaddai. That this signifies consolation after hardships, is evident from the signification of "Shaddai," as being temptation and consolation after it (n. 1992, 4572); here therefore consolation 
after the hardships they had suffered in Egypt. That it is consolation after hardships is plain also from the words that follow in continuance-"give you mercies before the man." That "Shaddai" signifies 
temptation and consolation after it, is because the ancients designated the One Only God by various names, according to the various things that were from Him; and as they believed that temptations 
were from Him, they then called God "Shaddai," and by this name they did not mean another God, but the Only One in respect to temptations. But when the Ancient Church declined, they began to worship 
as many gods as there were names for the One Only God, and also of themselves added to them many more. This practice at last became so prevalent that every family had its own god, and they wholly distinguished 
him from the rest who were worshiped by other families.  [2] Terah's family, of which was Abraham, worshiped Shaddai for its god (see n. 1356, 1992, 2559, 3667); and hence not only Abraham, 
but Jacob also, acknowledged Shaddai as his god, even in the land of Canaan; and this was permitted them lest they should be forced from their own religiosity; for no one is forced from what he regards 
as holy. But as the ancients understood by "Shaddai" Jehovah Himself, or the Lord, who was so styled when they underwent temptations, therefore Jehovah or the Lord regained this name with Abraham, 
as is plain from Gen. 17:1, and also with Jacob, Gen. 35:11. The reason why not merely temptation, but consolation also, is signified by "Shaddai," is that consolation follows all spiritual temptations. 
This has been given me to know by experience in the other life; for when anyone there suffers hard things from evil spirits, through infestations, incitements to evils, and persuasions to falsities, 
after the evil spirits have been removed, he is received by angels, and is brought into a state of comfort by means of a delight conformable to his genius. </p>

<p align="center"><b>Elliott(1983-1999) 5628</b></p><p><b>5628.</b>
'And may God Shaddai' means the comfort that follows hardships. This is clear from the meaning of 'Shaddai' as temptation, also the comfort that follows temptation, dealt with in <a href="1992.htm">1992</a>, <a href="4572.htm">4572</a>, here therefore 
the comfort which followed all the hardships they experienced in Egypt. The meaning here - the comfort that follows severe sufferings - is also evident from the words 'grant you mercy before the 
man' which immediately follow. The reason why 'Shaddai' means temptation, also the comfort that follows temptation, is that the ancients gave the one and only God various illustrious names which were 
descriptive of the various things that came from Him; and because they believed that even temptations came from Him they called Him 'God Shaddai'. They did not understand some other God by this name 
but the one and only God so far as temptations were concerned. When however the Ancient Church went downhill they began to worship as many gods as there were names of the one and only God; indeed they 
increased the number of them with many more which they themselves invented. This trend continued until at length each family had its own god whom that family kept quite distinct and separate from all 
other gods worshipped by other families. </p>
<p></p>
<p><b>[2]</b>
 The family of Terah, which Abraham came from, worshipped Shaddai as its particular god, see <a href="1356.htm">1356</a>, <a href="1992.htm">1992</a>, <a href="2559.htm">2559</a>, <a href="3667.htm">3667</a>. Consequently not only Abraham but 
Jacob too recognized Shaddai as their god; and they did so in the land of Canaan. But to avoid any compulsion of them to forsake the form of religion they had - for no one is compelled to forsake what 
for him is holy - they were allowed to keep to it. However, because the ancients had meant Jehovah Himself or the Lord by the name Shaddai, which they used when they underwent temptations, Jehovah or 
the Lord took this name in His dealings with Abraham, as is evident from <a href="http://bible.gospelcom.net/cgi-bin/bible?passage=Gen%2017:1&amp;version=ESV&amp;interface=print&amp;showfn=yes&amp;showxref">Gen 17:1</a>, and-also in His dealings with Jacob, <a href="http://bible.gospelcom.net/cgi-bin/bible?passage=Gen%2035:11&amp;version=ESV&amp;interface=print&amp;showfn=yes&amp;showxref">Gen 35:11</a>. </p>
<p></p>
<p><b>[3]</b>
 The reason why not only temptation but also comfort is meant 
by 'Shaddai' is that comfort follows all spiritual temptations, as I have been allowed to know from experience in the next life. When anyone there is subjected to hardships at the hands of evil spirits, 
who attack him, incite him to evil practices, and persuade him to accept falsities, he is subsequently received by angels, once the evil spirits have been turned away, and he is brought into a state 
of consolation by means of some delight in keeping with his character. </p>

`Et Deus Shaddai':  quod significet consolationem post dura, constat ex significatione `Shaddai' quod sit tentatio, et post tentationem consolatio, de qua n. 1992, 4572, hic itaque consolatio post dura 
quae passi sunt {1} in Aegypto; quod sit consolatio post dura, patet quoque a verbis quae continenter sequuntur `det vobis misericordias coram viro'. Quod `Shaddai' significet tentationem, et post 
tentationem consolationem, est quia antiqui insigniverunt Unicum Deum variis nominibus, secundum varia quae ab Ipso; et quia crediderunt etiam tentationes ab Ipso fuisse, vocaverunt tunc Deum {2} Shaddai, 
at per id nomen non alium Deum intellexerunt sed Unicum quoad tentationes; verum cum Antiqua Ecclesia declinavit, coeperunt tot deos colere quot nomina Unici Dei fuerunt, et quoque ex se plures 
superaddiderunt; hoc tandem ita invaluit ut unaquaevis familia haberet suum deum, et prorsus {3}distingueret illum a reliquis qui ab aliis colebantur; [2] familia Terahi, e qua Abraham, pro suo deo colebat 
 Shaddai, videatur n. 1356,1992,2559,3667, inde non solum Abraham sed etiam Jacob (illum) ut suum deum agnoscebant, et quoque in terra Canaan; at ne (c)a `religioso suo' cogerentur, nemo enim a 
suo sancto cogitur, permittebatur hoc illis; sed quia ab antiquis per illum intellectus fuit Ipse Jehovah seu Dominus, Qui ita appellatus cum tentationes subiverunt, ideo Jehovah seu Dominus recepit hoc 
nomen apud Abrahamum, ut patet ex Gen. xvii 1, et quoque apud Jacobum, Gen. xxxv 11.  Quod non modo tentatio sed etiam consolatio per `Shaddai' significetur, est quia post omnes tentationes spirituales 
sequitur consolatio; quod ab experientia in altera vita scire datum est; cum enim ibi aliquis dura patitur a spiritibus malis per infestationes, excitationes ad mala, et persuasiones ad falsa, post 
cum spiritus mali remoti sunt, recipitur is ab angelis et in statum solatii per jucundum ejus genio conforme perducitur. @1 i prima vice cum fuerunt$ @2 i nomine$ @3 distinguerent I$ </p>
