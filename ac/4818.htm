<h3 align="center" class="ired">属天的奥秘 第4818节</h3>
<h4 align="center"></h4><p><strong>4818.</strong>“犹大在那里看见一个迦南人的女儿”表由源于邪恶的虚假所生的对邪恶的情感。这从“女儿”、“人”和“迦南人”的含义清楚可知：“女儿”是指对良善的情感（<a href="2362.htm">2362</a>节），在反面意义上是指对邪恶的情感（<a href="3024.htm">3024</a>节）；“人”是指拥有聪明的人，抽象意义上是指真理，但在反面意义上是指没有聪明的人和虚假，如刚才所述（<a href="4816.htm">4816</a>节）；“迦南人”是指邪恶（<a href="1573.htm">1573</a>，<a href="1574.htm">1574</a>节）。由此明显可知，“迦南人的女儿”表示由源于邪恶的虚假所生的对邪恶的情感。下面将说明何为由源于邪恶的所生的邪恶。<br />在此必须先说一下犹大支派的来源，因为他们是本章论述的主题。该支派或犹太民族有三个来源，第一个来源是犹大与他的迦南妻子所生的儿子示拉，第二个和第三个分别是犹大与他的儿媳所生的儿子法勒斯和谢拉。整个犹太民族就来自犹大的这三个儿子，这一点从所列举的随雅各到埃及的儿子和孙子（创世记<a href="http://39-27.cn/创46.12.htm">46:12</a>）的名单，以及他们按家族的分类明显看出来；在摩西五经提到：<br />按着家族，犹大的众子：属示拉的，有示拉家族；属法勒斯的，有法勒斯家族；属谢拉的，有谢拉家族。（民数记<a href="http://39-27.cn/民26.20.htm">26:20</a>；历代志上<a href="http://39-27.cn/代上4.21.htm">4:21</a>）<br />这表明该民族来源的性质，也就是说，他们三分之一来自迦南母亲，三分之二来自儿媳。因此，他们都是非常结合的产物，因为与迦南女子结婚是严厉禁止的（这明显可见于创世记<a href="http://39-27.cn/创24.3.htm">24:3</a>；出埃及记<a href="http://39-27.cn/出34.16.htm">34:16</a>；申命记<a href="http://39-27.cn/申7.3.htm">7:3</a>；列王记上<a href="http://39-27.cn/王上11.2.htm">11:2</a>；以斯拉记九和十章），与儿媳同寝则是死罪；这明显可见于摩西五经：<br />人和他的儿媳妇同寝，他们二人都必须被处死；他们行了乱伦的事，他们的血要归在他们身上。（利未记<a href="http://39-27.cn/利20.12.htm">20:12</a>）<br />犹大与儿媳所行的，将犹大与小叔娶嫂的婚姻律法联系在一起，该律法的制定针对的是弟兄，绝不是父亲。这一点从本章（38:26）明显看出来，犹大因与儿媳的行为而与这条律法的联系暗示了他与他玛所生的儿子被视为珥的儿子；珥则是迦南母亲所生的长子，在耶和华眼中看为恶，于是被治死了（38:7）。在小叔娶嫂的婚姻中头生的孩子并不属于从他成孕的那个人，而属于他的种被养育的人；这一点从申命记（<a href="http://39-27.cn/申25.5.htm">25:5</a>，<a href="http://39-27.cn/申25.6.htm">6</a>）和本章（38:8，9）清楚看出来。此外，他玛所生的儿子其实是淫乱的结果；因为犹大与她同寝时，她是一个妓女（38:15，16，21）。由此可见犹太民族的来源，以及这种来源是何性质；还可以看出他们在约翰福音中所说“我们不是从淫乱生的”（约翰福音<a href="http://39-27.cn/约8.41.htm">8:41</a>）这句话是一个谎言。<br />至于这个来源暗示并代表什么，这从下文明显看出来。也就是说，这些人的内层就具有这种性质，或具有这种来源。犹大娶迦南人暗示了一个出自源于邪恶的虚假所生的邪恶的来源，因为这就是“迦南人的女儿”在内义上所表示的。他因行淫而与儿媳同寝暗示并代表由于被邪恶所歪曲的真理而受的诅咒，因为在圣言中，“淫乱”处处表示对真理的歪曲（<a href="3708.htm">3708</a>节）。源于邪恶的虚假所生的邪恶是一种由自我之爱，也就是那些陷入此爱之人的邪恶所孵化并被圣言字义所确认的虚假教义产生的一种邪恶生命。这就是犹太民族当中邪恶的来源，也是基督教界中某些人，尤其是圣言中巴比伦所指的那些人当中邪恶的来源。该邪恶具有这样的性质：它会关闭通向内在人的所有道路，并且关闭得如此彻底，以致良心根本无法在那里形成。事实上，人出于虚假教义所行的任何邪恶，他都以之为良善，因为他以之为真理。因此，他会自由、快乐地行出来，因为他如此行是有正当理由的。正因如此，天堂向关闭得如此彻底，以致它无法被打开。<br />举例说明这种邪恶的性质。对那些出于自我之爱的邪恶认为，耶和华只拣选了一个民族，其余的人类相对来说都是奴隶，且如此卑贱，以致他们可被随意杀死，或被残忍虐待，如犹太民族过所认为的，以及这个巴比伦式的民族现在所认为的那样，并出于圣言的字义确认这种信仰的人来说，凡他们出于这种虚假教义，以及建立在如同其源泉的该教义基础上的其它教义所行的邪恶，就是源于邪恶的虚假所生的邪恶。这种邪恶摧毁内在人，并阻止任何良心在那里形成。这些人在圣言中被称作“好流人血的”；因为他们以野蛮的方式对待不崇敬他们的信仰，因而不崇敬他们自己，不在他们的祭坛上献上礼物的全人类。<br />再举一例。对那些出于自我之爱和尘世之爱的邪恶认为必须有某个人担任主在地上的代牧，这个人拥有打开和关闭天堂，因而掌控所有人的心智和良心的权柄，并出于圣言的字义确认这种虚假的人来说，凡他们出于这种信仰所行的邪恶，都是源于邪恶的虚假所生的邪恶；这种邪恶同样摧毁那些出于此恶为自己索取这种权柄，并以这种方式掌控他人之人的内在人。该邪恶会彻底摧毁内在人，以致他们不再知道何为内在人，也不知道人还有良心，因而不相信死后的任何生命，也不相信天堂或地狱的存在，无论他们如此谈论这些事。<br />这种邪恶具有这样的性质，世人无法将它与其它邪恶区分开来；但在来世，天使却看得一清二楚。因为在来世，邪恶与虚假的性质和来源中的无数差别尽收眼底；并且地狱的划分也取决于这些邪恶与虚假所属的属和种。对于这些无数差别，人几乎一无所知；他只相信邪恶的存在，却不知道它的性质；原因很简单，他不知道何为良善，不知道何为良善是因为不知道何为仁爱。他若知道仁之良善，也会知道反面或邪恶，以及它们的区别。</p>

And Judah saw there a daughter of a man, a Canaanite. That this signifies the affection of evil from the falsity of evil, is evident from the signification of a "daughter," as being the affection of 
good (n. 2362), and in the opposite sense the affection of evil (n. 3024); and from the signification of a "man," as being one who is intelligent, and in the abstract sense truth, but in the opposite 
sense one who is not intelligent, and falsity, as just above (n. 4816); and from the signification of a "Canaanite," as being evil (n. 1573, 1574). From this it is evident that by a "daughter of a man 
a Canaanite" is signified evil which is from the falsity of evil. What evil from the falsity of evil is, will be shown below. [2] Here something must first be said about the origins of the tribe of 
Judah, for they are described in this chapter. There are three origins of this tribe, or of the Jewish nation-one from Shelah, the son of Judah, by his Canaanite wife; another from Perez, and the third 
from Zerah, the sons of Judah by Tamar his daughter-in-law. That the whole Jewish nation was from these three sons of Judah is evident from the enumeration of the sons and grandsons of Jacob who came 
with him into Egypt (Gen. 46:12); and also from their classification according to families, in Moses: </p>
<p>     The sons of Judah according to their families were: of Shelah, the family of the Shelanites; 
of Perez, the family of the Perezites; of Zerah, the family of the Zerahites (Num. 26:20; 1 Chron. 4:21); </p>
<p>this shows what the origin of that nation was, namely, that one third of them was from the 
Canaanite mother, and that two thirds of them were from the daughter-in-law; consequently that all were from an illegitimate connection, for marriages with the daughters of the Canaanites were strictly 
forbidden (as is evident from Gen. 24:3; Exod. 34:16; Deut. 7:3; 1 Kings 11:2; Ezra 9 and 10), and to lie with one's daughter-in-law was a capital offense, as is evident in Moses: </p>
<p>     If a man lie 
with his daughter-in-law, both of them shall surely be put to death; they have wrought confusion; their bloods shall be upon them (Lev. 20:12). Judah's referring this deed with his daughter-in-law 
to the levirate law in which an ordinance is made regarding the brother, but by no means regarding the father (as appears from verse 26 of this chapter), implies that his sons by Tamar should be acknowledged 
as the sons of Er his firstborn, who was born of the Canaanite mother, and who was evil in the eyes of Jehovah, and was therefore caused to die (verse 7); for those who were born first to the 
husband's brother were not his by whom they were conceived, but his whose seed they raised up, as is evident from Deuteronomy 25:5, 6, and also from verses 8 and 9 of this chapter. Moreover, those who 
were born of Tamar were born of fornication; for Judah thought when he went unto her that she was a harlot (verses 15, 16, 21). This shows whence and of what quality was the origin of the Jewish nation, 
and that they spoke falsely when they said, "We were not born of fornication" (John 8:41). [3] What this origin involves and represents is plain from what follows, namely, that their interiors were 
of such a quality, or had such an origin. Judah's marrying a Canaanite involves an origin from the evil which is from the falsity of evil, for this is signified in the internal sense by "a daughter 
of a man, a Canaanite;" his lying with his daughter-in-law involves and represents damnation from falsified truth from evil, for everywhere in the Word whoredom signifies the falsification of truth (n. 
3708). Evil from the falsity of evil is evil of life from false doctrine which has been hatched by the evil of the love of self (that is, by those who are in this evil), and confirmed by the sense 
of the letter of the Word. Such is the origin of evil with the Jewish nation, and such is its origin with some in the Christian world, especially with those who in the Word are meant by Babylon. This 
evil is of such a nature that it closes every way to the internal man, insomuch that nothing of conscience can be formed therein; for the evil which a person does from false doctrine, he believes to be 
good, because he believes it to be true; and therefore he does it freely and with delight, as allowable. Thus heaven is so closed to him that it cannot be opened. [4] The quality of this evil may be 
shown by an example. With those who from the evil of the love of self believe that Jehovah has chosen a single nation only, and that all the rest of mankind are relatively slaves, and so vile that they 
may be killed at pleasure or be cruelly treated - as the Jewish nation believed, and at this day the Babylonish nation also believes - and confirm this belief from the sense of the letter of the Word, 
then whatever evil they do from this false doctrine and others built upon this as a foundation, is evil from the falsity of evil, and destroys the internal man, preventing any conscience from ever 
being formed therein. These are they spoken of in the Word who are said to be "in bloods," for they are in cruel rage against the whole human race which does not adore their articles of faith, and thus 
themselves, and does not offer its gifts upon their altars.  [5] Take another example: with those who from the evil of the love of self and of the world believe that there must be someone as the 
Lord's vicar on earth, who has the power of opening and shutting heaven, and thus of ruling over the minds and consciences of all, and who confirm this falsity from the sense of the letter of the Word, 
whatever of evil they do from this belief is evil from the falsity of evil, which in like manner destroys the internal man with those who from this evil claim for themselves this power, and in this 
way rule; and this evil is destructive to such a degree that they no longer know what the internal man is, nor that anyone has conscience, consequently they no longer believe that there is any life after 
death, nor that there is a heaven or a hell, no matter how they may speak of these things. [6] This evil, as regards its quality, cannot be distinguished by men in the world from other evils, but 
in the other life it is known by the angels as in clear day; for evils and falsities are manifest in that life as to their distinctions of quality and origin, which are innumerable; and according to 
the genera and species of these also are the distinctions of the hells. Concerning these innumerable differences man knows scarcely anything; he merely believes that evil exists, but what its quality 
is he does not know, and this for the sole reason that he does not know what good is, and this because he does not know what charity is; for if he had known the good of charity he would have known also 
the opposites or evils, with their distinctions. </p>

'And there Judah saw the daughter of a man, a Canaanite' means the affection for evil begotten by falsity springing from evil. This is clear from the meaning of 'the daughter' as the affection for good, 
dealt with in <a href="2362.htm">2362</a>, and in the contrary sense as the affection for evil, <a href="3024.htm">3024</a>; from the meaning of 'a man' as one who has intelligence and, in the abstract sense, as truth, but in the contrary sense 
as one who has no intelligence and as falsity, dealt with just above in <a href="4816.htm">4816</a>; and from the meaning of 'a Canaanite' as evil, dealt with in <a href="1573.htm">1573</a>, <a href="1574.htm">1574</a>. From these meanings it is evident that 'the daughter 
of a man, a Canaanite' means evil begotten by falsity springing from evil. What evil begotten by falsity springing from evil is will be stated below. </p>
<p></p>
<p><b>[2]</b>
 Here the origins of the tribe of Judah 
must be stated first, since these are the subject in this chapter. That tribe, or the Jewish nation, has three origins, the first being Shelah, Judah's son by his Canaanite wife, the second and third 
being Perez and Zerah, Judah's sons by his daughter-in-law. The descent of the whole Jewish nation from these three sons of Judah is evident from the list of Jacob's sons and grandsons who accompanied 
him into Egypt, <a href="http://bible.gospelcom.net/cgi-bin/bible?passage=Gen%2046:12&amp;version=ESV&amp;interface=print&amp;showfn=yes&amp;showxref">Gen 46:12</a>, and also from the grouping of them into families, referred to in Moses, </p>
<p>The sons of Judah according to their families were: of Shelah, the family of the Shelanites; 
of Perez, the family of the Parzites; of Zerah, the family of the Zarhites. <a href="http://bible.gospelcom.net/cgi-bin/bible?passage=Num%2026:20;%201&amp;version=ESV&amp;interface=print&amp;showfn=yes&amp;showxref">Num 26:20; 1</a> <a href="http://bible.gospelcom.net/cgi-bin/bible?passage=Chron%204:21&amp;version=ESV&amp;interface=print&amp;showfn=yes&amp;showxref">Chron 4:21</a>. </p>
<blockquote>
From this the nature of that nation's origin is evident; that is to say, a third of them were 
descended from a Canaanite mother and two thirds from a daughter-in-law. They were all therefore the product of an illicit union, because marriages to daughters of the Canaanites were strictly forbidden 
- as may be seen in <a href="http://bible.gospelcom.net/cgi-bin/bible?passage=Gen%2024:3&amp;version=ESV&amp;interface=print&amp;showfn=yes&amp;showxref">Gen 24:3</a>; <a href="http://bible.gospelcom.net/cgi-bin/bible?passage=Exod%2034:16&amp;version=ESV&amp;interface=print&amp;showfn=yes&amp;showxref">Exod 34:16</a>; <a href="http://bible.gospelcom.net/cgi-bin/bible?passage=Deut%207:3;%201&amp;version=ESV&amp;interface=print&amp;showfn=yes&amp;showxref">Deut 7:3; 1</a> 
</blockquote>
Kings 11:2; and Chapters <a href="9.htm">9</a> and <a href="10.htm">10</a> of Ezra - while lying with a daughter-in-law was a capital offence, as is evident in Moses, </p>
<p>As regards a 
man who has lain with his daughter-in-law, both of them shall be killed; they have committed perversion;<A name="fntext1"></a><A href="#fn1"><sup>a</sup></a> their blood shall be upon them. Lev. 20:12. </p>
<p>What Judah and his daughter-in-law had done together 
was linked by him to the law regarding leviratical marriages, which lays down the duty of a brother but never of a father, as is evident from verse 26 of the present chapter Judah's linking of 
their deed together to this law implies that the sons of Tamar were to be recognized as the sons of Er the firstborn, who was born from the Canaanite mother, and who was evil in Jehovah's eyes and was 
therefore made to die, verse 7. For initially those born in a leviratical marriage did not belong to the one from whom they had been conceived but to him whose seed was being raised up, as is clear from 
Deut. 25:5, <a href="6.htm">6</a>, and also from verses 8 and <a href="9.htm">9</a> of the present chapter. Furthermore, the sons whom Tamar bore were the result of whoredom, for when Judah went in to her he thought she was a prostitute, 
verses 15, 16, 21. From all this one can see the origin of the Jewish nation and what kind of origin this was; and one can see that their words in John were founded on a lie, </p>
<p>The Jews said to Him, 
We were not born of whoredom. John 8:41. </p>
<p></p>
<p><b>[3]</b>
 As regards what that origin implies and what it represents, this is evident from what follows. That is to say, those people's interiors were the same 
or had the same origin. Judah's marriage to a Canaanite implies and represents an origin that consisted in evil begotten by falsity springing from evil, for this is what is meant in the internal sense 
by 'the daughter of a man, a Canaanite'. And his lying through whoredom with his daughter-in-law implies and represents condemnation due to truth falsified by evil, for throughout the Word 'whoredom' 
means the falsification of truth, see <a href="3703.htm">3703</a>.<A name="fntext2"></a><A href="#fn2"><sup>b</sup></a> Evil begotten by falsity springing from evil is an evil life resulting from a false teaching hatched by the evil of self-love - that is, by those governed 
by this evil - and backed up by a use of the sense of the letter of the Word. This is what the origin of the evil in the Jewish nation is like, and what the origin of the evil is like in the Christian 
world, especially among those meant in the Word by Babel. The nature of that evil is such that it closes every path leading into the internal man, closing every path so completely that no conscience 
at all can be formed there. For if any evil done by a person is due to a false teaching, he believes that this is good because he believes that it is true. He accordingly does it, because he has warrant 
to do so, with a sense of freedom and delight. All this being so, heaven is closed so completely against him that it cannot be opened. </p>
<p></p>
<p><b>[4]</b>
 As an example to explain what this evil is like, take 
those who from the evil of self-love believe the following: One nation alone is Jehovah's chosen people, in comparison with whom all the rest of mankind are slaves. The rest, they believe, are so base 
that they may be killed at will and may be treated in a cruel fashion. Such ideas, likewise backed up by a use of the sense of the letter of the Word, were the beliefs of the Jewish nation, as they 
are also of the Babylonish<A name="fntext3"></a><A href="#fn3"><sup>c</sup></a> nation at the present day. Whatever kind of evil done by the latter that is the result of that false teaching, and of any other false teachings built on that one as their 
foundation, is evil begotten by falsity springing from evil. It destroys the internal man and shuts out even the possibility of any conscience being formed there. These people are referred to in the 
Word as those immersed in bloodshed; for they treat in savage ways the entire human race because it does not venerate what they believe and so themselves too, and because it does not present its gifts 
on their altars. </p>
<p></p>
<p><b>[5]</b>
 Take another example - those who from the evil of self-love and love of the world believe in the necessity for someone to act as the Lord's vicar on earth. They believe that this 
person has power to open and close heaven, and so to control everyone's mind and conscience, and they back up this falsity by a use of the sense of the letter of the Word. In their case whatever kind 
of evil they perform as a result of these ideas is evil begotten by falsity springing from evil, which similarly destroys the internal man in those who are led by that evil to lay claim to that power 
and so control others. That evil destroys the internal man so completely that people cease to know any longer what the internal man is, or to know of the existence of conscience in anyone, with the 
result that they cease to believe any longer in a life after death, or in the existence of hell and of heaven, however much they talk about these. </p>
<p></p>
<p><b>[6]</b>
 The nature of this evil is such that people 
in the world cannot tell it apart from other evils; but in the next life angels recognize it quite clearly. For in the next life the countless differences in the essential nature and the origin of evils 
and falsities are in full view; and it is also the genera and species to which these evils and falsities belong that mark off the hells from one another. Of these countless differences man knows scarcely 
anything. He believes in the existence of evil but has no knowledge of its essential nature, for the simple reason that he does not know what good is, and does not know what good is because he 
does not know what charity is. If he knew what the good of charity was he would also know its opposites, which are evils, and also their differences.

<p>inde patet quod per `filiam viri Canaanitae' significetur malum quod ex falso mali; quid malum ex falso mali, dicetur infra: hic primum dicendum est de originibus 
tribus Jehudae, nam de illis in hoc capite agitur: sunt tres origines illius tribus seu gentis Judaicae, una est ex Shelah filio Jehudae ex uxore Canaanitide, altera ex Perez, et tertia ex 
Zerah, filiis Jehudae ex Tamare nuru sua; quod ex illis tribus filiis Jehudae omnis gens Judaica, patet ex recensione filiorum et nepotum Jacobi, qui (o)cum illo venerunt in Aegyptum, Gen. xlvi 12; 
tum ex classificatione eorum secundum familias, de qua apud Mosen,           Fuerunt filii Jehudae secundum familias eorum, Shelae      familia Shelonitae, Perezo familia Parzitae, Zeraho familia  
    Zarhitae, Num. xxvi 20, et 1 Paral. iv 21; </p>
<p>qualis origo illius gentis sit, inde patet, quod nempe tertia pars eorum ex matre Canaanitide, et binae tertiae partes ex nuru, omnes inde ex illegitimo 
toro, conjugia enim cum filiabus Canaanitarum severe prohibita fuerunt, ut constare potest ex Gen. xxiv 3; Exod. xxxiv 16; Deut. vii 3; Reg. xi 2; (o)Ezra ix et xi; et cubare cum nuru erat mortis, 
ut patet apud Mosen,           Quod ad virum qui concubuerit cum nuru sua, occidendo      occidentur ambo, confusionem fecerunt, sanguines eorum super      iis, Lev. xx 12; </p>
<p>quod Jehudah hoc 
factum cum nuru, retulerit ad legem de leviratu, in qua de fratre statuitur, nusquam de patre {1}, ut patet a vers. 26 hujus capitis, hoc involvit quod (o)filii ex Tamare agnoscerentur pro filiis 
Eri primogeniti, qui natus ex matre Canaanitide, et malus fuit in oculis Jehovae, et ideo mori factus {2}, vers. 7; nam qui primum nati sunt per leviratum, non erant ejus a quo concipiebantur, sed

apud aliquos in orbe Christiano, imprimis apud illos qui in Verbo intelliguntur per `Babelem'; id malum tale est ut praecludat omnem viam ad internum hominem, usque adeo ut in (c)illo non aliquid 
conscientiae possit formari; nam malum quod homo ex falso doctrinali facit, hoc credit esse bonum, quia credit esse verum et sic ex licito, libero et jucundo facit; inde ita ei occluditur caelum ut 
aperiri nequeat.  [4] Quale hoc malum est {5}, explicationi sit exemplum: qui ex malo amoris sui credunt quod solum unica gens sit quam elegerat Jehovah, et reliqui omnes in mundo sint respective 
servi et tam viles ut possint occidi ad libitum, etiam crudeliter tractari, et hoc quoque confirmant ex sensu litterae Verbi, sicut gens Judaica crediderat, et hodie quoque gens Babylonica {6}, tunc 
quicquid mali ex falso illo doctrinali faciunt et ex reliquis doctrinalibus quae constructa sunt super illo ut fundamentali, est malum ex falso mali et destruit internum hominem et praecludit ne 
usquam aliqua conscientia ibi formari possit; (m)illi enim sunt de quibus in Verbo, qui dicuntur in sanguinibus esse, nam in saevitiis sunt contra omne genus humanum quod non eorum credenda et sic 
eos adorat, et super eorum altaribus sua munera offert.(n)  [5] Sit etiam exemplum: qui ex malo amoris sui et mundi credunt quod aliquis erit vice Domini in terra et quod ei potestas sit aperiendi et 
claudendi caelum, ita imperandi super omnium animos et conscientias, et id falsum confirmant ex Verbi sensu litterae, tunc quicquid mali inde faciunt, est malum ex falso mali, quod similiter destruit 
internum hominem apud illos qui ex malo isto potestatem illam sibi vindicant, ac ita imperant; et destruit usque adeo ut non sciant amplius quid sit internus homo, nec quod sit alicui conscientia, 
proinde ut non magis credant quod sit aliqua vita post mortem, nec quod infernum, nec quod caelum, utcumque de illis loquuntur. {7}  [6] Hoc malum quale sit, non potest discerni a malis aliis 
ab hominibus in mundo, sed in altera vita ab angelis cognoscitur sicut in clara die; apparent enim ibi mala ac falsa qualia sunt et unde sunt, quoad sua discrimina, quae innumerabilia sunt; secundum 
illorum genera et species etiam inferna distincta sunt; de his innumerabilibus homo vix aliquid novit; credit modo quod malum sit sed quale malum, non scit; hoc unice ex causa quia non novit quid 
bonum, et hoc quia non novit quid charitas; si charitatis bonum, etiam opposita seu mala cum suis discriminationibus novisset.      @1 i sic excusaverit$      @2 mortuus$      @3 A has these words
