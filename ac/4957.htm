<h3 align="center" class="ired">属天的奥秘 第4957节</h3>
<h4 align="center"></h4><p><strong>4957.</strong>由此可见，主所说的一切话里面都含有神性事物，尽管在那些陷入纯世俗事物的人，尤其那些陷入肉体事物的人看来，祂的话就像是任何人都能说出来的那种话。事实上，那些陷入肉体事物的人论到主的这些，以及其它所有话，会说，它们并不比当今时代那些雄辩而有学识的演讲家的讲道和说教更充满恩典，更具有分量。而事实上，他们的讲道和说教就像与里面的核仁和谷粒相比之下的外壳和糠秕。</p>

From all this it is evident that there were Divine things within everything the Lord said, although to those who are in merely worldly things, and especially to those who are in bodily things, His words 
appear to be such as any man might say. Nay, they who are in bodily things will say of these and all other words of the Lord, that they have not so much grace, and therefore not so much weight, as 
the discourse and preaching of those of the present age who speak with eloquence and learning; when yet their discourse and preaching are like the husk and chaff in comparison with the kernel and grain. </p>

<p align="center"><b>Elliott(1983-1999) 4957</b></p><p><b>4957.</b>
From all this it may be seen that all the things the Lord spoke about held matters of Divine concern within them, though it seems to people whose interests are entirely worldly, and especially to those 
whose interests are bodily ones, that He spoke about the same kinds of things as anyone else might have spoken. Indeed those immersed in bodily interests will say of these and all other words spoken 
by the Lord that they are no more full of grace and therefore do not carry any more weight than the sermons and preaching of those in our own day and age who, because of their learning, are excellent 
speakers. But in fact their sermons and preaching are like the shell and husk when compared with the kernel inside them. </p>

<p align="center"><b>Latin(1748-1756) 4957</b>
</p><b>4957.</b>
Ex his constare potest quod Divina fuerint intus omnibus quae Dominus locutus est, tametsi apparent coram illis qui in solis mundanis et magis coram illis qui in corporeis sunt, sicut talia quae 
unusquisque homo loqui posset, immo qui in corporeis sunt; ad illa et reliqua (t)verba Domini dicturi quod in illis non tanti gratia, proinde nec tantum pondus sit quantum in sermone et praedicatione 
illorum hujus saeculi qui ex eruditione cum eloquio loquuntur; cum tamen horum sermo et praedicatio est sicut squama et palea respective ad nuclearia. </p>
