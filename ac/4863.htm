Verses 15-18. And Judah saw her, and thought her to be a harlot, because she had covered her faces. And he turned aside unto her to the way, and said, Grant I pray that I may come to thee; for he knew 
not that she was his daughter-in-law. And she said, What wilt thou give me, that thou mayest come to me? And he said, I will send thee a kid of the goats from the flock. And she said, If thou wilt give 
a pledge till thou send it? And he said, What pledge shall I give thee? And she said, Thy signet, and thy kerchief, and thy staff that is in thy hand. And he gave them to her, and came to her; and 
she conceived to him. "And Judah saw her," signifies how the religiosity of the Jewish nation at that time regarded the internal things of the representative church; "and thought her to be a harlot," 
signifies no otherwise than as falsity; "because she had covered her faces," signifies that interior things were hidden to them; "and he turned aside unto her to the way," signifies that it adjoined 
itself because it was such; "and said, Grant I pray that I may come to thee," signifies lust for conjunction; "for he knew not that she was his daughter-in-law" signifies that it did not perceive it to 
be the truth of the representative church; "and she said, What wilt thou give me, that thou mayest come to me?" signifies the reciprocal of conjunction with a condition; "and he said, I will send thee 
a kid of the goats from the flock," signifies a pledge of conjunction; "and she said, If thou wilt give a pledge till thou send it?" signifies the reciprocal if there is certainty; "and he said, What 
pledge shall I give thee?" signifies that it was certain; "and she said, Thy signet," signifies a token of consent; "and thy kerchief," signifies by means of truth; "and thy staff that is in thy hand," 
signifies by means of its power; "and he gave them to her," signifies that thus it was certain; "and came to her," signifies conjunction; "and she conceived to him," signifies thus reception. </p>

Verses 15-18 And Judah saw her and supposed that she was a prostitute, because she had covered her face. And he turned aside to her at the wayside, and said, Allow me now to come [in] to you; for he 
did not know that she was his daughter-in-law. And she said, What do you give me for coming [in] to me? And he said, I will send a kid of the she-goats from the flock. And she said, If you give a pledge 
until you send it. And he said, What is the pledge which I am to give you? And she said, Your seal, your cord, and your rod which is in your hand. And he gave them to her, and came [in] to her; and 
she conceived from him. </p>
<p>'Judah saw her' means the way in which at that time the semblance of religion existing among the Jewish nation looked on the internal features of the representative Church. 
'And supposed that she was a prostitute' means that it supposed them to be nothing else than something false. 'Because she had covered her face' means that interior things were hidden from them. 'And 
he turned aside to her at the wayside' means that it associated itself because of what it was by nature. 'And said, Allow me now to come [in] to you' means a lustful desire to be connected with it. 'For 
he did not know that she was his daughter-in-law' means that it did not see it as the truth of the representative Church. 'And she said, What do you give me for coming [in] to me?' means a conditional 
acceptance to become joined. 'And he said, I will send a kid of the she-goats from the flock' means a pledge assuring a joining together. 'And she said, If you give me a pledge until you send it' 
means an acceptance provided it was made a certainty. 'And he said, What is the pledge that I am to give you?' means that which made it certain. 'And she said, Your seal' means a token of consent. 'Your 
cord' means through truth. 'And your rod which is in your hand' means through the power of this. 'And he gave them to her' means that in this way it was made certain. 'And came [in] to her' means 
the joining together. 'And she conceived from him' means and so reception </p>

Vers. 15-18.  Et vidit illam Jehudah, et reputabat illam  meretricem, quia obtexit facies suas. Et declinavit ad illam ad viam, et dixit, Da quaeso veniam ad te, quia non novit quod nurus ejus illa; 
et dixit, Da quaeso veniam ad te, quia non novit quod nurus ejus illa; et dixit, Quid das mihi quod venias ad me?  Et dixit, Ego mittam haedum caprarum de grege; et dixit, Si des arrhabonem usque 
ad mittere te.  Et dixit, Quae arrhabo quam dabo tibi? et dixit, Sigillum tuum, panniculum tuum, et baculum tuum qui in manu tua; et dedit illi, et venit ad illam, et concepit ei. `Vidit illam Jehudah' 
significat religiosum gentis Judaicae quomodo tunc consideraret interna Ecclesiae repraesentativae: `et reputabat illam meretricem' significat quod non aliter ac falsum: `quia obtexit facies 
suas' significat interiora quod illis abscondita: </p>
<p>`et declinavit ad illam ad viam' significat quod se applicaret quia tale: `et dixit, Da quaeso veniam ad te' significat libidinem conjunctionis: 
`quia non novit quod nurus ejus illa' significat quod non apperciperet verum Ecclesiae repraesentativae esse: 'et dixit, Quid das mihi quod venias ad me?` significat conjunctionis reciprocum cum conditione: </p>
<p>`et 
dixit, Ego mittam haedum caprarum de grege' significat pignus conjunctionis: `et dixit, Si des mihi arrhabonem usque ad mittere te' significat reciprocum si certitudo: `et dixit, Quae 
arrhabo quam dabo tibi?' significat quod certum: `et dixit, Sigillum tuum' significat tesseram consensus: `panniculum tuum' significat per verum: `et baculum tuum qui in manu tua' significat per potentiam ejus: 
`et dedit illi' significat ita certum: `et venit ad illam' significat conjunctionem: et concepit ei' significat sic receptionem. </p>
