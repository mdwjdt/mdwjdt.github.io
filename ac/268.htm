<h3 align="center" class="ired">属天的奥秘 第268节</h3>
<h4 align="center"></h4><p><strong>268.</strong>对于“土”表人的外在，这从前文对“地”、“土”、“田”所作的解释可知。人重生以后，他不再称为“地”，而是称为“土”，因为天堂之种已种在他内里。圣经多处将他们比作“土”，或称之为“土”。良善和真理之种被种在人的外在，亦即人的情感和记忆中，不是被种在人的内在，因为内在没有自我，自我只存于外在。人的内在是良善和真理，当它们看似失落以后，人就成为外在的或属肉体的人。其实，它们依然被主保存于内在中，人并不知晓。只有当外在好似死去以后，它们才显露出来。而外在好似死去，常发生在试探、苦难、病痛、临死之时。<br />理性也属于外在（<a href="118.htm">118</a>节），是内在和外在之间的一个媒介，因为内在藉着理性去支配属肉体的外在。但是，当理性认同自我以后，就将外在与内在分离了，导致人不知有内在存在，更不知内在的聪明智慧为何物。</p>

<p><strong>[NCE]268.</strong> The symbolism of the ground as our outer self can be seen in what was said earlier [<a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_268/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_90" target=_top>90</a>] about the land, the ground, and the field.<br />People who have been regenerated are no longer called land but ground, because they have been planted with heavenly seed. The Word in many places also compares them to ground or calls them such. It is our outer self, or the feelings and memory of our outer self, that the seeds of goodness and truth are planted in. They are not sown in our inner self because the inner self lacks anything of our own; things of our own exist in the outer self.<br />Our inner being holds good qualities and true thoughts. When they seem to have departed, we are then shallow, body-oriented people. Still, the Lord stores those things up in our inner self without our knowing. They do not come out of hiding until our outer self dies, so to speak, as frequently happens in times of trial, misfortune, grave illness, or imminent death.<br />The ability to reason also belongs to the outer self (<a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_268/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_118" target=_top>118</a>). In its true character, that capacity is a kind of bridge between the inner self and the outer, because the inner self directs the outer, body-centered self by means of it. But when the rational mind consents [to self-dependence], it separates the outer self from the inner, so that we no longer know the inner self exists. As a result, we also fail to see what understanding and wisdom are, belonging as they do to the inner realm. </p>

That the "ground" signifies the external man, is evident from what was previously stated concerning "earth" "ground" and "field." When man is regenerate, he is no longer called "earth" but "ground" because 
celestial seed has been implanted in him; he is also compared to "ground" and is called "ground" in various parts of the Word. The seeds of good and truth are implanted in the external man, that 
is, in his affection and memory, and not in the internal man, because there is nothing of one's Own in the internal man, but only in the external. In the internal man are goods and truths, and when 
these no longer appear to be present, the man is external or corporeal; they are however stored up in the internal man by the Lord, without the man's knowledge, as they do not come forth except when the 
external man as it were dies, as is usually the case during temptations, misfortunes, sicknesses, and at the hour of death. The rational belongs also to the external man (n. 118), and is in itself 
a kind of medium between the internal man and the external; for the internal man, through the rational, operates on the corporeal external. But when the rational consents, it separates the external man 
from the internal, so that the existence of the internal man is no longer known, nor consequently the intelligence and wisdom which are of the internal. </p>

<p align="center"><b>Elliott(1983-1999) 268</b></p><p><b>268.</b>
That 'the ground' means the external man becomes clear from what has been stated already about earth, ground, and field. When a person has become regenerate he is no longer called the earth but the ground, 
the reason being that celestial seeds have been planted within him. Various other statements in the Word compare him to the ground and actually call him the ground. It is the external man, that 
is, his affection and memory, in which the seeds of good and truth are planted, not his internal man, for the internal does not have within it anything that is man's own, but only the external. Within 
the internal there are goods and truths, and when these are seemingly present no longer, he is in that case an external, that is, a bodily-minded person. In actual fact they have been stored away by 
the Lord within the internal man without his knowing it; for they do not emerge until the external man so to speak dies, which normally happens in times of temptation, misfortune, sickness, and the hour 
of death. The rational too belongs to the external man, see <a href="118.htm">118</a>, and in itself is a kind of go-between for the internal man and the external, for the internal man operates byway of the rational into 
the bodily external. But once the rational concedes, it separates the external man from the internal, so that neither the existence of the internal man is known any longer, nor consequently what intelligence 
and wisdom are, which belong to the internal man.  </p>

</p><b>268.</b>
Quod 'humus' significet externum hominem, constare potest ab iis quae prius de terra et de humo et de agro dicta sunt: quando homo regeneratus est, non amplius vocatur terra sed humus, quia ei implantata 
sunt semina caelestia; humo etiam comparatur et humus vocatur passim in Verbo; est externus homo, seu ejus affectio et memoria, cui implantantur semina boni et veri, non autem interno homini, quia 
in interno nulla sunt propria hominis, sed in externo: in interno sunt bona et vera, quae cum non amplius adesse apparent, tunc homo est externus seu corporeus; tametsi recondita sunt in interno a 
Domino, quod homo nescit, nam non prodeunt nisi cum externus quasi moritur, ut solet in tentationibus, infortuniis, morbis, momentis mortis.  Rationale etiam ad externum hominem pertinet, n. 118, quod 
in se est quoddam medium inter internum et externum, nam internus per rationale operatur in externum corporeum; at cum rationale consentit, tunc illud separat externum ab interno, ita ut non amplius 
sciatur quod internus sit, inde nec quid intelligentia et sapientia quae sunt interni. </p>
