<h3 align="center" class="ired">属天的奥秘 第4849节</h3>
<h4 align="center"></h4><p><strong>4849.</strong>创世记38:12-14.过了许多日子，犹大的妻子书亚的女儿死了，犹大得了安慰，他就和他朋友亚杜兰人希拉到亭拿，上他剪羊毛的人那里。有人告诉他玛说，看哪，你的公公上亭拿剪羊毛去了。他玛就脱了她作寡妇的衣裳，蒙上帕子，又遮住身体，坐在亭拿路上的源泉门口，因为她见示拉已经长大，还没有娶她为妻。<br />“过了许多日子”表状态的变化。“书亚的女儿死了”表就虚假所生的邪恶而言。“犹大的妻子”表存在于源自雅各，尤其经由犹大而来的民族当中的宗教表象。“犹大得了安慰”表安息。“上他剪羊毛的人那里”表某种提升，以便为了教会进行请教。“他就和他朋友亚杜兰人希拉”表它仍陷在那虚假中。“到亭拿”表状态。“有人告诉他玛说”表与代表属灵和属天事物的教会的某种交流。“看哪，你的公公上亭拿剪羊毛去了”表犹太教会想为自己进行请教。“他玛就脱了她作寡妇的衣裳”表假冒源于良善的真理。“蒙上帕子”表真理变得模糊。“又遮住身体”表因而得不到承认。“坐在亭拿路上的源泉门口”表介于教会真理与虚假之间的事物。“因为她见示拉已经长大，还没有娶她为妻”表对于它只能与存在于雅各后代，尤其经由犹大而来的后代当中的宗教表象结合的洞察。</p>

Verses 12-14. And the days were multiplied, and Shua's daughter died, the wife of Judah; and Judah was comforted, and went up unto the shearers of his flock, he and his companion Hirah the Adullamite, 
to Timnah. And it was told Tamar, saying, Behold thy father-in-law goeth up to Timnah to shear his flock. And she put off from upon her the garments of her widowhood, and covered herself in a veil, 
and wrapped herself, and sat in the gate of the fountains which is upon the way to Timnah; for she saw that Shelah was grown up, and she was not given to him for a woman. "And the days were multiplied," 
signifies a change of state; "and Shua's daughter died," signifies as to evil from falsity; "the wife of Judah," signifies the religiosity with the nation descended from Jacob, specifically that from 
Judah; "and Judah was comforted," signifies rest; "and went up unto the shearers of his flock," signifies some elevation to take counsel for the church; "he and his companion Hirah the Adullamite," 
signifies that it was still in falsity; "to Timnah," signifies the state; "and it was told Tamar, saying," signifies some communication with a church representative of spiritual and celestial things; 
"Behold thy father-in-law goeth up to Timnah to shear his flock," signifies that the Jewish Church wished to take counsel for itself; "and she put off from upon her the garments of her widowhood," signifies 
a simulation of the truth that is from good; "and covered herself in a veil," signifies truth obscured; "and wrapped herself," signifies thus not acknowledged; "and sat in the gate of the fountains 
which is upon the way to Timnah," signifies what is intermediate to the truths of the church and to falsities; "for she saw that Shelah was grown up, and she was not given to him for a woman," signifies 
discernment that it could not otherwise be conjoined with the religiosity in which was the posterity of Jacob, specifically that from Judah. </p>

Verses 12-14 And the days were multiplied, and Shua's daughter died, the wife of Judah; and Judah was comforted, and he went up to the shearers of his flock, he and his companion Hirah the Adullamite, 
to Timnah. And it was pointed out to Tamar, saying, Behold, your father-in-law is going up to Timnah to shear his flock. And she took off the clothes of her widowhood from upon her, and covered herself 
with a veil, and concealed herself, and sat in the gate of the fountains, which is on the road to Timnah; for she saw that Shelah had grown up, and she had not been given to him as a wife. </p>
<p>'The 
days were multiplied' means a change of state 'And Shua's daughter died' means so far as evil begotten by falsity was concerned. 'The wife of Judah' means the semblance of religion existing among the 
nation descended from Jacob, specifically that from Judah. 'And Judah was comforted' means rest. 'And he went up to the shearers of his flock' means some kind of raising up to consult the interests of 
the Church. 'He and his companion Hirah the Adullamite' means that falsity was present with it still. 'To Timnah' means the state 'And it was pointed out to Tamar, saying' means some kind of communication 
with the Church that was representative of spiritual and celestial things. 'Behold, your father-in-law is going up to Timnah to shear his flock' means that the Jewish Church had a wish to consult 
its own interests. 'And she took off the clothes of her widowhood from upon her' means an imitation of truth that springs from good. 'And covered herself with a veil' means the truth was rendered obscure. 
'And concealed herself' means and so was not acknowledged. 'And sat in the gate of the fountains, which is on the road to Timnah' means that which lies between the truths of the Church and falsities. 
'For she saw that Shelah had grown up, and she had not been given to him as a wife' means the insight that it could not otherwise be joined to the semblance of religion existing with those descended 
from Jacob, specifically those descended through Judah. </p>

Vers.  12-14.  Et multiplicati dies, et moriebatur filia Shuae uxor Jehudae, et consolatus Jehudah, et ascendit ad tonsores gregis sui, is et Hirah socius ejus Adullamita, Timnatham. Et indicatum 
Tamari, dicendo, Ecce socer tuus ascendit Timnatham ad tondendum gregem suum. Et removit vestes viduitatis suae a super se, et obtexit in peplo, et operuit se; et sedit in ostio fontium, qui super 
via Timnatham; quia vidit quod adolevit Shelah, et illa non data ei in mulierem. `Multiplicati dies' significat status mutationem: `et moriebatur filia Shuae' significat quod malum ex falso: `uxor 
Jehudae' significat religiosum apud gentem e Jacobo, in specie ex Jehudah: `et consolatus Jehudah' significat requiem: </p>
<p>'et ascendit ad tonsores gregis sui' significat aliquid elevationis ad consulendum 
Ecclesiae:  `is et Hirah socius ejus Adullamita' significat quod usque in falso esset: `Timnatham' significat statum: `et indicatum Tamari, dicendo' significat communicationis quid cum Ecclesia 
repraesentativa spiritualium et caelestium: `Ecce socer tuus ascendit Timnatham ad tondendum gregem suum' significat quod Ecclesia Judaica sibi vellet consulere: `et removit vestes viduitatis suae 
a super se' significat simulationem veri quod ex bono: `et obtexit in peplo' significat verum obscuratum: `et operuit se' significat sic non agnitum: `et sedit in ostio fontium, qui super via Timnatham' 
significat intermedium ad vera Ecclesiae et ad falsa: `quia vidit quod adolevit Shelah, et illa non data ei in mulierem' significat perspectionem quod non aliter conjungi possit religioso 
in quo posteritas ex Jacobo, in specie quae ex Jehudah. </p>
