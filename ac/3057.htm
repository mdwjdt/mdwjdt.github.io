<h3 align="center" class="ired">属天的奥秘 第3057节</h3>
<h4 align="center"></h4><p><strong>3057.</strong>“众女子出来打水的时候”表一种教导状态。这从“时候”和“打水的女子”或打水人的含义清楚可知：“时候”是指状态，如刚才所述（<a href="3056.htm">3056</a>节）；“打水的女子”或打水人是指接受教导，如下文所述。从3054节直到现在所阐述的内容就是本节作为历史事件来讲述的细节在内义上所表示的。至于这一系列细节包含什么，人若没有接受教导，了解属世人、记忆知识和其中的教义，以及真理如何从属世人被提升进入理性人，并变成理性，甚至不知道理性人相对于属世人的性质，也就是存在于理性人里面的概念相对于存在于属世人里面的形像的性质，就很难弄清楚。<br />理性人里面的这些概念对于活在肉身的世人来说并不明显。属世人里面的事物会进入人的意识，但理性人里面的事物很少进入，除非有一种光照到属世人里面的那些事物或形像上，或有一种流入的能力进入人的思想观念，将它们整理成序，或人获得一种洞察力，能发觉心智在思考什么。若不知道这些及其它事，本节所包含的内容很难解释明白。例如，这里的意思是对一般记忆知识的一种神圣排序，然后从教义除去，以便接受信之真理；这种排序和这种除去是在一种模糊状态下进行的，像这样的一种状态就是教导的状态。<br />然而，在尽可能理解的范围内，我们可以简要描述一下人在被主改造时所发生的事。因为人的改造在某种程度上就是主在世时发生在祂身上的一切的一个形像，如前所述（<a href="3043.htm">3043</a>节）。人在经历改造时，其属世人里面的一般事物就被主整理成序，以便它们对应于天上的事物。至于何为对应，以及对应是属灵之物和属世之物之间的一种关系，可参看前文（<a href="2987.htm">2987</a>，<a href="2989.htm">2989</a>-<a href="2991.htm">2991</a>，<a href="3002.htm">3002</a>节）。一般事物先被排序，以便具体事物能逐渐被主引入一般事物中，然后特定事物被引入具体事物中。如果一般事物没有秩序，那么具体事物不可能有秩序，因为后者进入并确认前者。而特定事物更不可能有秩序，因为这些事物如同具体事物进入一般事物那样进入具体事物，并光照它们。这就是对一般记忆知识的一种神圣排序的意思，也是“叫骆驼跪下”在内义上的意思。它们以这种方式使自己顺服，以接受流注。<br />当一般记忆知识以这种方式被排序时，教义就被除去了，因为它们是取自这些知识的结论。可以说有一种指示通过理性流入进来，宣称这件事是真的，那件事不是真的：说它真，是因为它与整理成序的一般记忆知识一致；说它不真，是因为它不一致。就真理而言，并没有其它流注存在。教义的确早已存在，但在没有被人信奉之前，它们并非真正的教义，纯粹是记忆知识。因此，当人思想它们时，所得出的任何结论都不是从它们，而是从其它事物得来的，仅仅涉及它们。这就是从教义除去的意思，也是此处“城外”在内义上的意思。不过，这种状态是一种所谓的模糊状态，由“傍晚时分”来表示；而一旦教义被确认，以至于被信奉，那么“早晨”，或光明的状态就到来了。从刚才的阐述明显可知本节所包含的其它一切事。</p>

About the time that the drawers go out. That this signifies a state of instruction, is evident from the signification of "time," as being state (see just above, n. 3056); and from the signification of 
a "drawer," that is, one who draws water, as being to be instructed-to be explained in what follows. What has now been told (from n. 3054) is what is signified in the internal sense by the things related 
historically in this verse; but what these particulars involve in a series is not easily made plain to one who has not been instructed concerning the natural man, and concerning the memory-knowledges 
and doctrinal things therein, and also how truths are elevated therefrom into the rational, and become rational; and still less if he does not know what is the quality of the rational relatively 
to the natural, that is, the quality of the things in the rational relatively to those in the natural. [2] The things in the rational are not apparent to man while he lives in the body; for those in 
the natural are what come to perception, and seldom those in the rational, except by a certain kind of light illuminating the things in the natural, or as an inflowing capacity by which the ideas of 
thought are disposed into order; and also as a faculty of perceiving that which the mind is considering. Unless these and other things be known, what is contained in this verse can with difficulty be 
explained to the apprehension, as that there is a holy disposing of the general memory-knowledges, and then a removal from doctrinal things for receiving the truths of faith; and that when this is taking 
place there is an obscure state, and that such is the state of instruction. Nevertheless we may briefly state as much as can be apprehended, and here, how the case is with a man then he is being reformed 
by the Lord; for the reformation of a man is a kind of image of what took place with the Lord then He was in the world (as was said above, n. 3043). [3] When a man is being reformed, the general 
things in his natural man are disposed by the Lord to correspondence with those which are in heaven. (What correspondence is, and that it is between spiritual things and natural things, may be seen 
above, n. 2987, 2989-2991, 3002.) General things are first disposed, in order that particulars may be successively insinuated into them by the Lord, and singulars into the particulars; for if the general 
things are not in order, there cannot come forth order in the particulars, because the particulars enter into the generals, and confirm them; still less can there be order in the singulars, because 
these enter into the particulars as into their generals, and illustrate them. These are the things that are meant by a holy disposing of general memory-knowledges; and this is meant in the internal 
sense by "making the camels kneel down;" for so they submit themselves for the reception of influx. [4] When the general memory-knowledges are being disposed in this way, doctrinal things are removed, 
as they are conclusions from these knowledges; for there flows in through the rational as it were a dictate that this is true, and this not true; but in this way-that it is true because it agrees 
with the orderly disposition of the general memory-knowledges; and that it is not true because it disagrees; there is no other influx as to truths. Doctrinal things are indeed there before, but they are 
not doctrinal things until they are believed, but are merely memory-knowledges; and therefore when the man thinks about them, no conclusion is drawn from them, but only concerning them, from other 
things. This is what is meant by removal from doctrinal things, and it is what is here signified in the internal sense by "without the city." But this is the state that is called an obscure state, and 
is signified by the "time of evening;" whereas when doctrinal things have been confirmed, so that they are believed, then comes the "morning," or a state of light. The other things contained in this 
verse are evident from what has been already stated. </p>

<p align="center"><b>Elliott(1983-1999) 3057</b></p><p><b>3057.</b>
'At the time that women go out to draw water' means a state of instruction. This is clear from the meaning of 'time' as state, dealt with immediately above in <a href="3056.htm">3056</a>, and from the meaning of 'a woman who 
draws' or a drawer of water, as receiving instruction, dealt with below. What has been stated so far from <a href="3054.htm">3054</a> onwards presents the meaning in the internal sense of the details related in this verse 
as a historical event. What those details embody in a single sentence however is not readily apparent to anyone who has not been taught anything about the natural man, or about the facts and matters 
of doctrine belonging there, or indeed about the way in which truths are raised up from the natural man into the rational and become rational. They are even less apparent to him if he does not know the 
nature of the rational when compared with the natural, that is, the nature of the concepts present in the rational when compared with the images in the natural. </p>
<p></p>
<p><b>[2]</b>
 Those concepts in the rational 
do not come immediately into a person's view while he is living in the body. For it is the things in the natural which enter his awareness, rarely those in the rational except when a certain kind of 
light falls on those images in the natural, as when some mental power enters into and arranges into order the contents of a person's thought, or as when one gains an insight into the matter on which 
the mind is dwelling. Unless these and many other considerations are known, scarcely any intelligible explanation of what occurs in this verse is at all possible; such as that a holy ordering of general 
facts is meant, and also a removal from matters of doctrine so as to receive the truths of faith, and that this ordering and this removal occur during a state of obscurity, and that a state such as 
this is one of instruction. </p>
<p></p>
<p><b>[3]</b>
 Nevertheless let a brief description be given, insofar as the matter can be understood, of what goes on in a person when he is being reformed by the Lord, for man's 
reformation is to some extent an image of what happened to the Lord when He was in the world, as stated above in <a href="3043.htm">3043</a>. While a person is being reformed the things that are general within his natural 
man are being ordered by the Lord so that they correspond to things that are in heaven. What correspondence is, and the fact that it is a relationship between spiritual things and natural, see <a href="2987.htm">2987</a>, <a href="2989.htm">2989</a>-<a href="2991.htm">2991</a>, <a href="3002.htm">3002</a>. The things which are general are first of all ordered in such a way that those which are particular can be gradually introduced into them by the Lord, and then those that are specific 
into these. For unless the general are ordered, no order can come to the particular, because the latter enter into and confirm the former. Still less can order come to the specific, for these enter into 
the particular (which act as general things for them) and give light to the particular. This is what is meant by a holy ordering of general facts, and what is meant in the internal sense by making 
the camels kneel down. In this way they submit themselves to receive influx. </p>
<p></p>
<p><b>[4]</b>
 While these things are being ordered in this manner matters of doctrine are removed since they are conclusions drawn 
from facts. For so to speak a dictate flows in by way of the rational, declaring that one thing is true, another not true - true because it agrees with general things when ordered, or not true because 
it disagrees. No other type of influx as to truths exists. Matters of doctrine are indeed present already, yet they are not really matters of doctrine until they are believed, but merely facts. When 
they are thought about therefore, any conclusion that is drawn is not from them but from other things concerning them. This is what is meant by being removed from matters of doctrine, and what is meant 
in the internal sense here by 'outside the city'. But this state is what is called an obscure state and is meant by 'evening time'; but once matters of doctrine have been confirmed so that they are 
believed morning, or a state of light arrives. All else in this verse is evident from what has now been stated. </p>

`Juxta tempus exire haustrices': quod significet statum instructionis, constat a significatione `temporis' quod sit status, de qua mox supra n. 3056; et a significatione `haustricis' seu haurientis, 
nempe aquam, quod sit instrui, de qua sequitur. {1}Illa quae huc usque a n. 3054 dicta, sunt quae in sensu interno significantur per haec quae in hoc versu historice relata sunt; quid autem singula in 
una serie involvunt, non facile patet alicui qui non instructus est de naturali homine, et de scientificis `et doctrinalibus quae' ibi, tum quomodo inde vera elevantur in rationale, et fiunt rationalia; 
et adhuc minus si non scit quale est rationale respective ad naturale, seu qualia illa quae in rationali, respective ad illa quae in naturali; [2] quae in rationali sunt nec apparent coram homine 
dum in corpore vivit; sunt enim illa quae in naturali quae ad apperceptionem veniunt, raro illa quae in rationali, nisi per quandam speciem lucis illuminantis illa quae in naturali, {2}aut sicut facultas 
influens, per quam disponuntur in ordinem illa quae cogitationis sunt, (c)ac sicut perceptivum rei quam mens intuetur; nisi haec et plura cognita sint, aegre possunt ad captum exponi illa quae in 
hoc versu; sicut, quod sit dispositio sancta scientificorum communium, et tunc remotio a doctrinalibus, ad recipienda vera fidei, et cum haec, quod sit status obscurus, et quod talis sit status instructionis: 
[3] usque paucis licet dicere quantum ad captum, at hoc quomodo se res habet apud hominem cum is a Domino reformatur, quia reformatio hominis est quaedam imago illorum quae apud Dominum cum 
Ipse in mundo fuit, ut supra n. 3043 dictum; cum reformatur homo, tunc quae sunt communia in naturali ejus homine, a Domino disponuntur ad correspondentiam illorum quae in caelo sunt; quid correspondentia, 
et quod sit inter spiritualia et naturalia, videatur n. 2987, 2989-2991, 3002; communia primum disponuntur ut particularia illis successive a Domino insinuari possint, (c)et his singularia; si enim 
non ordo communium sit, non potest existere ordo particularium, quia haec intrant in illa et confirmant, minus ordo singularium, quia haec intrant in particularia ut in sua communia, et illustrant; 
haec sunt quae intelliguntur per dispositionem sanctam scientificorum communium, et in sensu interno significantur per quod `in genua procumbere fecerit camelos'; sic enim se submittunt ad recipiendum 
influxum.  [4] Cum haec ita disponuntur, tunc removentur doctrinalia, nam haec sunt conclusiones a scientificis, influit enim per rationale sicut dictamen, quod hoc verum sit, hoc non verum; sed ita, 
quod verum sit quia concordat cum dispositione communium, non verum quia discordat; non datur alius influxus quoad vera; doctrinalia quidem prius insunt, sed non sunt doctrinalia antequam creduntur, 
sunt modo scientifica, quare cum de illis cogitatur, non ex illis conclusio fit, sed ex aliis de illis; haec sunt quae intelliguntur per remotionem a doctrinalibus, et in sensu interno significantur 
hic per `extra urbem'; sed hic status est qui dicitur status obscurus, et significatur per `tempus vesperae'; cum autem doctrinalia confirmata sunt ut credantur, tunc venit `mane' seu status lucidus. 
 Reliqua quae in hoc versu, ab illis quae nunc dicta sunt, patent. @1 haec sunt$  @2 et$  </p>
