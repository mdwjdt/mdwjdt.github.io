<h3 align="center" class="ired">属天的奥秘 第4865节</h3>
<h4 align="center"></h4><p><strong>4865.</strong>“以为她是妓女”表它以为它们无非是某种虚假。这从“妓女”的含义清楚可知，“妓女”是指虚假（<a href="2466.htm">2466</a>，<a href="2729.htm">2729</a>，<a href="3399.htm">3399</a>节）；因此，它表示这一事实：犹太民族出于其宗教表象将教会的内在无非视为虚假。“妓女”之所以表示虚假，是因为婚姻代表天上的婚姻，也就是良善与真理的婚姻；其中丈夫代表良善，妻子代表真理；因此，儿子代表真理，女儿代表良善；女婿和儿媳，公公和婆婆，以其它许多亲属关系，照其亲密度而代表那些属于天上婚姻的事物。奸淫和卖淫因是这些的对立面，故表示邪恶与虚假；并且也实实在在是它们的对立面，因为那些在奸淫和卖淫当中度过一生的人根本不关心良善和真理。原因在于，纯正的婚姻之爱是从天上的婚姻，也就是良善与真理的婚姻那里降下来的；而奸淫和卖淫则源于邪恶与虚假的苟合，这种苟合来自地狱（参看<a href="2727.htm">2727</a>-<a href="2759.htm">2759</a>节）。<br />无论过去还是如今，犹太民族都只是将教会的内在事物视为虚假；这一事实就是犹大以为他的儿媳他玛无非是妓女，并与她如同与一个妓女那样同寝所表示的。该民族的这种起源就代表了他们的宗教表象的起源和性质。显而易见，这个民族视教会的内在为妓女，或为虚假。例如，若有人告诉他们教会的这一内在真理：圣言的先知书部分所预言并且他们所等候的弥赛亚就是主，他们会把它当成虚假而完全加以弃绝。若有人告诉他们教会的这一内在真理：弥赛亚的国度不是世俗和短暂的，而是天上和永恒的，他们会声称这也是假的。若有人告诉他们，他们教会的宗教仪式代表弥赛亚及其天国，他们就不知道这是什么意思。<br />若有人告诉他们，教义的内在既是教义上同时也生活上的仁之良善和信之真理，他们认为这不过是一个谎言。其它一切例子也一样。事实上，仅仅暗示教会有一个内在，他们都会愚蠢地加以嘲笑。原因在于，他们唯独处于外在，事实上处于外在的最低层，也就是对尘世事物的热爱；困为他们比所有人都要贪婪，而这完全是世俗的。这种人绝无可能以任何其它方式看待教会的内在事物，因为他们距离天堂之光比其他人类更遥远，因而比其他所有人都更居于漆黑当中</p>

And thought her to be a harlot. That this signifies no otherwise than as falsity, is evident from the signification of a "harlot," as being falsity (n. 2466, 2729, 3399); and thus it means that the Jewish 
nation from its religiosity regards the internal of the church no otherwise than as falsity. That a "harlot" denotes falsity, is because marriage represents the heavenly marriage, which is of good 
and truth, the husband representing good, and the wife truth; and hence sons represent truths, and daughters goods; and son-in-law and daughter-in-law, father-in-law and mother-in-law, and the several 
relationships, according to their degrees, represent those things which are of the heavenly marriage. Therefore adulteries and harlotries, being opposite, signify evil and falsity; and they are opposite 
in reality, for those who spend their lives in adultery and harlotry care nothing for good and truth. The reason is, that genuine conjugial love descends from the heavenly marriage, that is, from 
the marriage of good and truth; but adulteries and harlotries arise from the conjunction of evil and falsity, which is from hell (see n. 2727-2759). [2] That the Jewish nation regarded, and also at 
this day regards, the internal things of the church no otherwise than as falsities, is what is signified by Judah's regarding Tamar his daughter-in-law no otherwise than as a harlot, and by his conjoining 
himself with her as with a harlot. By this origin of that nation is represented the origin and quality of their religiosity. That this nation regards the internal of the church as a harlot, or 
as falsity, is very evident. As for example, if anyone tells them that it is an internal of the church that the Messiah-whose coming is predicted in the prophetic parts of the Word and whom they therefore 
expect-is the Lord, they utterly reject it as false. If anyone tells them that it is an internal of the church that the Messiah's kingdom is not worldly and temporal, but heavenly and eternal, they 
pronounce this also to be false. If anyone tells them that the rituals of their church represented the Messiah and His heavenly kingdom, they do not know what this means. [3] If anyone tells them 
that the internal of the church is the good of charity, and the truth of faith in doctrine and at the same time in life, they regard it as no otherwise than false. And so in all other instances. Nay, 
at the mere suggestion of the church having an internal, they laugh stupidly. The reason is that they are solely in externals, and indeed in the lowest of externals, namely, the love of earthly things; 
for they above all other men are in avarice, which is altogether earthly. Such men cannot possibly regard the interior things of the church in any other way; for they are more remote from heavenly light 
than the rest of mankind, thus above all others are in thick darkness. </p>

<p align="center"><b>Elliott(1983-1999) 4865</b></p><p><b>4865.</b>
'And supposed that she was a prostitute' means that it supposed them to be nothing else than something false. This is clear from the meaning of 'a prostitute' as that which is false, dealt with in <a href="2466.htm">2466</a>, <a href="2729.htm">2729</a>, <a href="3399.htm">3399</a>, and so as the fact that with its semblance of religion the Jewish nation looked on the internal aspect of the Church as nothing else than something false. The reason 'a prostitute' means 
that which is false is that a marriage represents the heavenly marriage, which is that of good and truth. The husband represents good and the wife truth, and therefore sons represent truths and daughters 
forms of good, while a son-in-law and a daughter-in-law, a father-in-law and a mother-in- law, and many others as determined by their degrees of affinity, represent aspects of the heavenly marriage. 
Therefore, being opposites of these, acts of adultery and prostitution mean evil and falsity, and are in all reality the opposite of them, for people who spend their lives committing adultery or 
behaving as prostitutes have no concern at all for what is good and true. The reason for this is that genuine conjugial love comes down from the heavenly marriage, that is, from the marriage of good 
and truth, whereas adultery and prostitution spring from evil and falsity joined together - from hell; see <a href="2727.htm">2727</a>-<a href="2759.htm">2759</a>. </p>
<p></p>
<p><b>[2]</b>
 The fact that the Jewish nation looked, as also at the present day it looks, 
on the internal features of the Church as nothing else than falsities is meant by Judah's supposition that Tamar his daughter-in-law was no one else than a prostitute and by his connection with her 
as with a prostitute. This origin of that nation represents the origin and also the essential nature of their semblance of religion. It is plain to see that this nation looks on the internal aspect of 
the Church as a harlot, that is, as something false. For example, if anyone tells them it is an internal truth of the Church that the Messiah, who is foretold in the prophetical parts of the Word and 
whom they await, is the Lord, they completely reject this as something false. If anyone tells them it is an internal truth of the Church that the Messiah's kingdom is not a worldly and temporal but a 
heavenly and eternal one, they declare this too to be something false If anyone tells them that the ritual observances of their Church represented the Messiah and His heavenly kingdom they have no idea 
what this is. </p>
<p></p>
<p><b>[3]</b>
 If anyone tells them that the internal aspect of the Church is the good of charity and the truth of faith, both in doctrine and at the same time in life, they regard this as nothing 
else than a falsity. And so it is with every other truth told them. Indeed at the mere suggestion of an internal aspect of the Church they laugh nonsensically. The reason for this is that they are 
immersed solely in things of an external nature, and indeed in the lowest of these, which consist in the love of earthly things; for more than all others they are steeped in avarice, which is utterly 
worldly. Such people cannot possibly look on the interior features of the Church in any other way, since they are further removed than all others from the light of heaven, and so more than all others 
dwell in thickest darkness. </p>

`Et reputabat illam meretricem': quod significet quod non aliter ac falsum, constat ex significatione `meretricis' quod sit falsum, de qua n. 2466, 2729, 3399, ita quod gens Judaica ex suo religioso 
consideret internum Ecclesiae non aliter ac falsum; quo `meretrix' sit falsum, est quia conjugium repraesentat conjugium caeleste quod est boni et veri, `maritus' bonum et `uxor' verum, a inde 
`filii' vera et `filiae' bona, atque gener et nurus,  socer et socrus et plures affinitates secundum gradus illa quae sunt conjugii caelestis idcirco `adulteria et meretricatus' quia sunt opposita, 
significant malum et falsum; et quoque reipsa sunt opposita, nam qui in adulterio (c)et meretricatu vitam agunt, nusquam curant bonum et verum; causa est quia amor genuinus conjugialis descendit ex 
conjugio caelesti hoc est, ex conjugio boni et veri; sed adulteria et meretricatus e conjunctione mali et falsi, quae est ex inferno, videatur n. 2727-2759. 2  Quod gens Judaica consideraverit et 
quoque hodie consideret interna Ecclesiae non aliter ac falsa, est quod significatur per quod Jehuda reputaverit Tamarem nurum suam non aliter ac meretricem, et quo cum illa {1}ut cum meretrice se 
conjunxerit; per originem talem illius gentis repraesentatur unde eorum religiosum, et quale est. Quod gens illa consideret internum Ecclesiae sicut scortum, seu ut falsum, patet manifeste; ut pro 
exemplo: si quis illis dicturus quod internum Ecclesiae sit, quod Messias de quo in propheticis Verbi praedicitur et quem ideo exspectant, sit Dominus, hoc prorsus sicut falsum rejiciunt: si quis 
dicturus quod internum Ecclesiae sit quod Messia regnum non mundanum et temporeum sit sed caeleste et aeternum hoc quoque ut falsum pronuntiant: si quis dicturus quod rituali Ecclesiae eorum repraesentaverint 
Messiam ac Ipsius regnum caeleste, 3    hoc non sciunt quid sit: si quis dicturus quod internum Ecclesiae si bonum charitatis et verum fidei, doctrina et simul vita, id spectant non aliter 
ac falsum: similiter in omnibus reliquis; (m)immo ad solam propositionem quod internum Ecclesiae sit, stupide rident;(n) causa est quia solum in externis sunt, et quidem in externorum infimis, 
quae sunt amare terrestria, sunt enim prae reliquis in avaritia, quae prorsus terrestris est; tales nequaquam aliter considerare possunt interiora Ecclesiae, sunt enim remotiores reliquis a luce caelesti, 
ita prae reliquis in densa caligine. @1 ac$ </p>
