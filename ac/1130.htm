And these are the births of Noah's sons: Shem, Ham, and Japheth; and sons were born to them after the flood.<br />2. The sons of Japheth: Gomer, and Magog, and Madai,{*1} and Javan, and Tubal, and Meshech, and Tiras.<br />3. And the sons of Gomer: Ashkenaz, and Riphath, and Togarmah.<br />4. And the sons of Javan: Elishah and Tarshish, Kittim and Dodanim.<br />5. From these the islands of the nations dispersed in their lands, each by its tongue, by their clans, in their nations.<br />6. And the sons of Ham: Cush, and Mizraim, and Put, and Canaan.<br />7. And the sons of Cush: Seba, and Havilah, and Sabtah, and Raamah, and Sabteca. And the sons of Raamah: Sheba and Dedan.<br />8. And Cush fathered Nimrod; he began to be mighty on the earth.<br />9. He was mighty in hunting before the face of Jehovah. For this reason there was a saying: "Like Nimrod, mighty in hunting before the face of Jehovah."<br />10. And the beginning of his kingdom was Babel, and Erech, and Accad, and Calneh, in the land of Shinar.<br />11. From that same land, Asshur{*2} went out and built Nineveh,{*3} and the city Rehoboth, and Calah,<br />12. and Resen, between Nineveh and Calah (this is the great city).<br />13. And Mizraim fathered the Ludim, and Anamim, and Lehabim, and Naphtuhim,<br />14. and Pathrusim, and Casluhim (from whom the Pelishtim{*4} came), and Caphtorim.<br />15. And Canaan fathered Sidon, his firstborn, and Heth,<br />16. and the Jebusite, and Amorite, and Girgashite,<br />17. and Hivite, and Arkite, and Sinite,<br />18. and Arvadite, and Zemarite, and Hamathite. And after that, the clans of the Canaanites scattered.<br />19. And the border of the Canaanites reached from Sidon as you come to Gerar, as far as Gaza, as you come to Sodom and Gomorrah and Admah and Zeboiim, as far as Lasha.<br />20. These are Ham's sons by their clans, by their tongues, in their lands, in their nations.<br />21. And Shem too had offspring. He was the father of all the sons of Eber; he was the older brother of Japheth.<br />22. The sons of Shem: Elam, and Asshur, and Arpachshad, and Lud, and Aram.<br />23. And the sons of Aram: Uz, and Hul, and Gether, and Mash.<br />24. And Arpachshad fathered Shelah, and Shelah fathered Eber.<br />25. And to Eber were born two sons. The name of one was Peleg (because in his days the land was divided),{*5} and the name of his brother was Joktan.<br />26. And Joktan fathered Almodad, and Sheleph, and Hazarmaveth, and Jerah,<br />27. and Hadoram, and Uzal, and Diklah,<br />28. and Obal, and Abimael, and Sheba,<br />29. and Ophir, and Havilah, and Jobab; all these are the sons of Joktan.<br />30. And their living space reached from Mesha as you come to Sephar, the mountain of the east.<br />31. These are Shem's sons, by their clans, by their tongues, in their lands, by their nations.<br />32. These are the clans of Noah's sons, by their births, in their nations, and from them the nations scattered in the land after the flood.<br /><br /><strong>Footnotes:</strong><br />{*1} (in the text of <a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_1130/bible_king-james-version_genesis_10_2" target=_top>Genesis 10:2</a>). "Madai" is a transliteration of the Hebrew word here (מָדַי [māḏay]), which many translators take to mean "the Medes." Swedenborg apparently saw it as a personal rather than a tribal name, since he used Madai rather than the Latin word for the Medes, which is Medi. "Kittim" and "Dodanim" in verse <a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_1130/bible_king-james-version_genesis_10_4" target=_top>4</a>, like most of the names ending in -im in this chapter, can likewise stand for ethnic groups (thought to be the people of Cyprus and Rhodes, respectively), but again Swedenborg treats them as the names of individuals when in <a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_1130/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_1158" target=_top>1158:1</a> he counts them among the seven sons of Gomer and Javan. This extension of an individual's name to serve as the identifier for a demographic group is common both in the Bible and in Swedenborg's analysis of it. [LHC]<br />{*2} (in the text of <a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_1130/bible_king-james-version_genesis_10_11" target=_top>Genesis 10:11</a>). In the biblical account, Asshur is the eponymous father of the Assyrian nation. [RS]<br />{*3} (in the text of <a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_1130/bible_king-james-version_genesis_10_11" target=_top>Genesis 10:11</a>). Nineveh, in northern Mesopotamia, was the capital of the Assyrian Empire that figured so largely in the Hebrew Bible (see, for example, the intermittent references in 2 Kings chapters <a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_1130/bible_king-james-version_2-kings_15_1-38" target=_top>15</a>-<a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_1130/bible_king-james-version_2-kings_19_1-37" target=_top>19</a>, 2 Chronicles chapter <a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_1130/bible_king-james-version_2-chronicles_32_1-33" target=_top>32</a>, and the many symbolic uses in Isaiah and other prophets). [RS]<br />{*4} (in the text of <a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_1130/bible_king-james-version_genesis_10_14" target=_top>Genesis 10:14</a>). The "Pelishtim" here mean the Philistines. In other contexts, Swedenborg translates the underlying Hebrew word, פְּלִשְׁתִּים (pǝlištîm), into the Latin Philist(h)aei, "Philistines;" here and occasionally elsewhere he transliterates it instead. [LHC]<br />{*5} (in the text of <a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_1130/bible_king-james-version_genesis_10_25" target=_top>Genesis 10:25</a>). The name Peleg comes from the Hebrew verb פָּלַג (pālaḡ), which means "divide." [LHC]<br />1130.
