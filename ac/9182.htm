<h3 align="center" class="ired">属天的奥秘 第9182节</h3>
<h4 align="center"></h4><p><strong>9182.</strong>“人若劝诱没有订婚的处女”表未与真理结合的良善。这从“劝诱”、“（男）人”、“处女”和“订婚”的含义清楚可知：“劝诱”当论及一个男人和一个处女时，是指男人引诱处女与他结合；“（男）人”是指真理（参看<a href="3134.htm">3134</a>，<a href="7716.htm">7716</a>，<a href="9007.htm">9007</a>节）；“处女”是指良善方面的教会（<a href="3081.htm">3081</a>，<a href="4638.htm">4638</a>节），因而是指系教会的良善；“订婚”是指结合。这里必须简要说明涉及此处所论述的非法结合的律法，以及该律法的原因和起源在哪里。为以色列人所定的一切律法，其原因在天堂，其起源就是那里的秩序律法。在天堂，秩序的律法皆来自从主发出的神性真理和良善，因而是关于爱之良善和信之真理的律法。在天堂，良善与真理的结合被称为天上的婚姻，该婚姻以世上的婚姻来代表，在圣言中，也由“婚姻”来表示。由此可见非法结合，以及淫乱或奸淫意味着什么。这两节论述的是非法结合，这种结合后来要么变得合法，要么被解除。本节论述的主题是后来变得合法的非法结合；而下一节论述的主题是后来被解除的非法结合。<br />非法结合不是出于对婚姻的情感，而是出于某种其它情感而作成的，如对美貌的情感，对金钱利益或个人地位的情感；要么它就是出于性欲而作成的。这些结合是非法的，因为这种结合是外在的，并非同时是内在的。然而，随后一种合法的结合可通过作为手段的它们而得以实现；当两个人属一个心智时，这种合法结合就会实现。另一方面，当两个人不属一个心智时，那么非法结合也可以成为防止随后结合的手段。这是世上众所周知的事。<br />当两个人处于相似的良善和真理时，合法的结合，也就是心智的结合就会实现；因为良善和真理构成一个人的生命：道德、文明的良善和真理构成外在人的生命，属灵的良善和真理构成内在人的生命。要知道，一个人的生命唯独来源于良善和真理；因为人所爱的一切都被称为良善，人所信的一切都称为真理。或也可说，人所意愿的一切都被称为良善，人所理解的一切都被称为真理。由此明显可知，当丈夫处于真理，妻子处于相应的良善时，一种合法的结合就实现了。因为天上的婚姻，也就是良善和真理的婚姻以这种方式以他们二人来代表。正因如此，婚姻之爱从该婚姻而降（参看<a href="2727.htm">2727</a>-<a href="2759.htm">2759</a>，<a href="2803.htm">2803</a>，<a href="3132.htm">3132</a>，<a href="4434.htm">4434</a>，<a href="4835.htm">4835</a>节）。<br />通过以上介绍，谁都可以认识到本节和下一节所论述的结合是何性质。结婚前的订婚自古以来就是一种习俗；它代表第一次结合，就是没有外在人的内在人的结合。随后的实际婚姻本身代表第二次结合，就是内在人与外在人一起的结合。因为在人通过信之良善和真理重生期间，内在人首先重生，然后外在人重生，因为外在人通过内在人重生（<a href="3286.htm">3286</a>，<a href="3321.htm">3321</a>，<a href="3493.htm">3493</a>，<a href="3882.htm">3882</a>，<a href="8746.htm">8746</a>节）。<br />由此明显可知，在圣言中，“订婚或许配”和“聘”，以及“新郎”和“新妇”表示什么；即 “订婚”表示真理和良善在内在人中的结合；在论述主和教会的地方，“新郎”表示良善，“新妇”表示真理，如在以下经文，耶利米书：<br />你年轻时的怜悯，订婚期间的爱情，那时你在旷野，在未曾耕种之地跟随我，我都记得。（耶利米书<a href="http://39-27.cn/耶2.2.htm">2:2</a>）<br />这论及古教会，以及它被主建立；“订婚期间的爱情”是指属于从信之真理和爱之良善所获得的属灵生命的情感；“你在旷野，在未曾耕种之地跟随我”表示当他们还不知道这些真理，并缺乏这良善时的一种渴望状态。<br />何西阿书：<br />当那日，我必为他们与田野的走兽和空中的飞鸟，并地上的爬行物立约。又必从这地折断弓剑和战争。我必以公义、公平、慈爱、怜悯聘你归我。（何西阿书<a href="http://39-27.cn/何2.18.htm">2:18</a>-<a href="http://39-27.cn/何2.19.htm">19</a>）<br />此处论述的是一个新教会的建立；“与田野的走兽和空中的飞鸟，并地上的爬行物立约”表示主通过与人同在的内在和外在的良善和真理所实现的结合。“约”是指结合（参看<a href="665.htm">665</a>，<a href="666.htm">666</a>，<a href="1023.htm">1023</a>，<a href="1038.htm">1038</a>，<a href="1864.htm">1864</a>，<a href="1996.htm">1996</a>，<a href="2003.htm">2003</a>，<a href="2021.htm">2021</a>，<a href="6804.htm">6804</a>，<a href="8767.htm">8767</a>，<a href="8778.htm">8778</a>节）；“田野的走兽”是指源于良善的生命（<a href="841.htm">841</a>，<a href="908.htm">908</a>节）；“飞鸟”是指真理的生命（<a href="40.htm">40</a>，<a href="745.htm">745</a>，<a href="776.htm">776</a>，<a href="991.htm">991</a>，<a href="3219.htm">3219</a>，<a href="5149.htm">5149</a>，<a href="7441.htm">7441</a>节）；“地上的爬行物”是指外在和感官之人的良善和真理（<a href="746.htm">746</a>，<a href="909.htm">909</a>节）；“折断弓剑和战争”表示摧毁虚假的教义和力量；“弓”是指虚假的教义（<a href="2686.htm">2686</a>，<a href="2709.htm">2709</a>节）；“剑”是指与真理争战的虚假（<a href="2799.htm">2799</a>，<a href="4499.htm">4499</a>，<a href="6353.htm">6353</a>，<a href="7102.htm">7102</a>节）；“战争”是指争战本身，或属灵的争战（<a href="1664.htm">1664</a>，<a href="2686.htm">2686</a>，<a href="8273.htm">8273</a>节），“打断”这些表示摧毁它们。<br />“以公义、公平聘”表示在良善和真理中与主结合；“聘”是指与人的自我结合；“公义”论及良善，“公平”论及真理（<a href="2235.htm">2235</a>节）；“以慈爱、怜悯聘”表示出于对那些处于良善之人的爱并在对那些处于真理之人的爱中结合；主的“慈爱”论及祂对那些缺乏良善，却渴望良善之人的爱，祂的“怜悯”论及祂对那些不知道真理，却渴慕真理之人的爱。由此明显可知，“聘”表示与一个人同在的良善和真理被主结合。谁都能看出，诸如此类的事就是何西阿书中这几节经文所表示的；因为就连来自纯属世之光的觉知也能清楚看出，耶和华不是与与田野的走兽和飞鸟，并地上的爬行物立约；而是与那些拥有信之良善和真理的人，因而与一个人里面的良善和真理立约；因此，这些事就隐藏在这段预言中。<br />玛拉基书：<br />犹大行事诡诈，因为他亵渎耶和华的圣洁，爱上侍奉外邦神的女子，聘她归己。（玛拉基书<a href="http://39-27.cn/玛2.11.htm">2:11</a>）<br />“聘侍奉外邦神的女子”表示与虚假的邪恶结合；“外邦神”是指虚假（<a href="4402.htm">4402</a>e，<a href="4544.htm">4544</a>，<a href="7873.htm">7873</a>节）。<br />凡论述主与教会的地方，“新郎”表示良善，“新妇”表示真理，这一点可见于下列经文：<br />耶和华以拯救为衣给我穿上，以公义为袍给我披上。好像新郎戴上华冠，又像新妇佩戴妆饰。（以赛亚书<a href="http://39-27.cn/赛61.10.htm">61:10</a>）<br />启示录：<br />我看见圣城新耶路撒冷由神那里从天而降，预备好了，就如新妇妆饰整齐，等候丈夫。（启示录<a href="http://39-27.cn/启21.2.htm">21:2</a>）<br /><br />有一位天使说，你来，我要将新妇，就是羔羊的妻，指示你。（启示录<a href="http://39-27.cn/启21.9.htm">21:9</a>）<br />此处“新妇”表示教会。<br />马太福音：<br />耶稣对约翰的门徒说，新郎和婚礼之子同在的时候，婚礼之子岂能哀恸呢？但日子将到，新郎要离开他们，那时候他们就要禁食。（马太福音<a href="http://39-27.cn/太9.15.htm">9:15</a>；路加福音<a href="http://39-27.cn/路5.34.htm">5:34</a>-<a href="http://39-27.cn/路5.35.htm">35</a>）<br />那些持守教会的真理，接受良善的人被称为“婚礼之子”，因为来自主的良善是“新郎”；“新郎和婚礼之子同在的时候，婚礼之子不会哀恸”意味着当他们持守与其良善结合的真理时，便处于一种极乐幸福的状态，因而与主同在；“新郎要离开他们，那时候他们就要禁食”意味着当良善不再与真理结合时，他们就处于一种不幸福的状态；这后一种状态就是教会的最后状态，而前一种状态是它的最初状态。<br />马太福音（<a href="http://39-27.cn/太25.1.htm">25:1</a>-<a href="http://39-27.cn/太25.12.htm">12</a>）中十个童女出去迎接的新郎所表相同；因为灯里有油的童女是指那些有良善在其真理里面的人；而那些灯里无油的童女是指那些没有良善在其真理里面的人（参看<a href="4638.htm">4638</a>节）；“油”是指爱之良善（参看<a href="886.htm">886</a>，<a href="3728.htm">3728</a>，<a href="4582.htm">4582</a>节）。<br />约翰福音：<br />约翰说，我不是基督，是奉差遣在祂前面的。娶新妇的就是新郎，新郎的朋友站着听见新郎，就因新郎的声音甚喜乐。（约翰福音<a href="http://39-27.cn/约3.28.htm">3:28</a>-<a href="http://39-27.cn/约3.29.htm">29</a>）<br />“新妇”表示构成教会信仰的真理；“新郎”表示构成教会之爱的良善，这二者都来自主；因此，它们表示良善与真理在他那里已经结合的一个教会成员。“站着听见的新郎朋友”表示由真理构成的信仰，“因新郎的声音甚喜乐”表示对构成信仰的真理的一种情感。由此也明显可知，这些经文（以赛亚书<a href="http://39-27.cn/赛62.5.htm">62:5</a>；耶利米书<a href="http://39-27.cn/耶7.34.htm">7:34</a>；<a href="http://39-27.cn/耶16.9.htm">16:9</a>；<a href="http://39-27.cn/耶25.10.htm">25:10</a>；<a href="http://39-27.cn/耶33.11.htm">33:11</a>；启示录<a href="http://39-27.cn/启18.23.htm">18:23</a>）中的“喜乐”，以及“新郎和新妇的声音”在内义上表示什么，即：天堂，以及由与人和天使同在的良善和真理的结合所产生的幸福。</p>

<p align="center"><b>Potts(1905-1910) 9182</b></p><p><b>9182.</b>
When a man shall persuade a virgin who is not betrothed. That this signifies good not conjoined with truth, is evident from the signification of "persuading," when said of a man and a virgin, as being 
to entice to conjunction; from the signification of "a man" [vir] as being truth (see n. 3134, 7716, 9007); from the signification of "a virgin," as being the church as to good (n. 3081, 4638), thus 
the good which is the church; and from the signification of "to be betrothed," as being conjunction. It shall here be briefly stated what is the cause and the origin of the law relating to unlawful conjunction 
that is here treated of. All the laws delivered to the sons of Israel have their cause in heaven, and their origin in the laws of order there. All the laws of order in heaven are from the Divine 
truth and good which proceed from the Lord, consequently they are the laws of the good of love and truth of faith. The conjunction of good and truth in heaven is called the heavenly marriage, and 
this is represented in marriages on earth, and is also signified by "marriages" in the Word. From this it is plain what is involved in unlawful conjunctions, and also in scortations and adulteries. 
In these two verses an unlawful conjunction is treated of which is afterward either made lawful or is dissolved. The unlawful conjunction which afterward is made lawful, is the subject treated of in this 
verse; and the unlawful conjunction which afterward is dissolved, is the subject treated of in the following verse.  [2] Unlawful conjunction is that which is not made from conjugial affection; but 
from some other affection, as the affection of beauty, the affection of gain, or the affection of personal rank; and also which is made from lasciviousness. In the beginning these conjunctions are 
unlawful, because that which conjoins is external, and not at the same time internal. Nevertheless, a lawful conjunction may afterward be effected from them as means, which takes place when the minds 
are conjoined; and on the other hand no conjunction may result from them, as is the case when the minds are disjoined. That this is so, is generally known in the world. [3] Lawful conjunction, which 
is that of minds, is effected when both are in the like good and truth; for good and truth make a man's life; moral and civil good and truth, the life of the external man; and spiritual good and truth, 
the life of the internal man. Be it known that a man's life is from no other source than good and truth, for all that a man loves is called good, and all that he believes is called truth; or, what is 
the same, all that a man wills is called good, and all that he understands is called truth. From this it is evident that a lawful conjunction is effected when the husband is in truth, and the wife is 
in the corresponding good, for in this way the heavenly marriage, which is that of good and truth, is represented in the pair. From this it is that conjugial love descends from this marriage (see n. 
2727-2759, 2803, 3132, 4434, 4835). [4] From these as premises it can be known how the case is with the conjunctions treated of in this verse and the following one. Betrothals before marriage have been 
in use from ancient times, and represented the first conjunction, which is that of the internal man apart from the external. The subsequent marriages themselves represented the second conjunction, 
which is that of the internal man with the external; for during man's regeneration by means of the goods and truths of faith, the internal man is first regenerated, and afterward the external, because 
the latter is regenerated by the former (n. 3286, 3321, 3493, 3882, 8746). [5] From this it is evident what is signified in the Word by "betrothing" and by "being betrothed," and also what by "bridegroom" 
and "bride;" namely, by "betrothing" is signified the conjunction of truth and good in the internal man; by "bridegroom" (where the Lord and the church are treated of) is signified good; and by 
"bride," truth: as in the following passages. In Jeremiah: </p>
<p>     I remembered for thee the mercy of thy youth, the love of thy betrothals, when thou wentest after Me in the wilderness, in a land not 
sown (Jer. 2:2); </p>
<p>speaking of the Ancient Church and of its being set up by the Lord; "the love of betrothals" denotes the affection of spiritual life, which is from the truths of faith and the good 
of love; and the state of desire, when as yet they were in ignorance and in want of these things, is signified by "going after Me in the wilderness, in a land not sown." [6] In Hosea: </p>
<p>     In that day 
I will make a covenant for them with the wild animal of the field, and with the bird of the heavens, and the creeping thing of the earth; and I will break the bow and the sword and the war; and I will 
betroth thee unto Me in righteousness and in judgment, and in mercy, and in compassions (Hos. 2:18-19); </p>
<p>the setting up of a new church is here treated of; "to make a covenant with the wild animal 
of the field, with the bird of the heavens, and with the creeping thing of the earth," denotes the conjunction of the Lord through the internal and external good and truth in a man. That "a covenant" 
denotes conjunction, see n. 665, 666, 1023, 1038, 1864, 1996, 2003, 2021, 6804, 8767, 8778; "the wild animal of the field" denotes life from good (n. 841, 908); "the bird" denotes the life of truth (n. 
40, 745, 776, 991, 3219, 5149, 7441); "the creeping thing of the earth" denotes the goods and truths of the external and sensuous man (n. 746, 909); "to break the bow, and the sword, and the war," 
denotes to destroy the doctrine and the forces of falsity; "the bow" denotes the doctrine of falsity (n. 2686, 2709); "the sword," falsity fighting against truth (n. 2799, 4499, 6353, 7102); "the war," 
the combat itself, or spiritual combat (n. 1664, 2686, 8273), and "to break" these denotes to destroy them. [7] "To betroth in righteousness and in judgment" denotes to be conjoined with the Lord in 
good and truth; "to betroth" denotes to conjoin with one's self; "righteousness" is predicated of good, and "judgment" of truth (n. 2235); "to betroth in mercy and in compassions," denotes doing so 
from love toward those who are in good, and in love toward those who are in truths; the Lord's "mercy" is predicated as being directed toward those who are in need of good and who yet long for it; and 
His "compassions," toward those who are in ignorance of truth and who yet long for it. From all this it is evident that "betrothal" denotes the conjunction of good and truth with a man by the Lord. Everyone 
can see that such things are here signified; for it is clear even to the perception from merely natural light that Jehovah does not make a covenant with the wild animal of the field, with the 
bird, and with the creeping thing of the earth; but with those who are in the good and truth of faith, thus with the good and truth in the man; consequently that such things are hidden in this prophecy. [8] 
And in Malachi: </p>
<p>     Judah hath dealt treacherously, for he hath profaned the holiness of Jehovah, in that he hath loved, and hath betrothed to himself, the daughter of a strange god (Mal. 2:11); </p>
<p>"to 
betroth the daughter of a strange god" denotes to be conjoined with the evil of falsity; "a strange god" denotes falsity (n. 4402, 4544, 7873). [9] That where the Lord and the church are treated 
of, the "bridegroom" denotes good, and the "bride" truth, may be seen in the following passages: </p>
<p>     Jehovah hath clothed me with the garments of salvation, He hath covered me with the robe of 
righteousness, as a bridegroom putteth on his headdress, and as a bride adorneth herself with her vessels (Isa. 61:10).      I saw the holy city, Jerusalem, coming down from God out of heaven, prepared 
as a bride adorned for her husband (Rev. 21:2).      The angel said, Come hither, I will show thee the bride, the lamb's wife (Rev. 21:9); </p>
<p>where "the bride" denotes the church. [10] In Matthew: </p>
<p> 
    Jesus said unto the disciples of John, Can the sons of the wedding mourn, so long as the bridegroom is with them? But the days will come, when the bridegroom shall be taken away from them, and 
then shall they fast (Matt. 9:15, and Luke 5:34-35); </p>
<p>those are called "sons of the wedding" who are in the truths of the church, and receive good, for the good which is from the Lord is "the bridegroom;" 
that "the sons of the wedding do not mourn so long as the bridegroom is with them" denotes that they are in a blessed and happy state, thus with the Lord, when they are in truths conjoined with their 
good; "they shall fast when the bridegroom is taken away from them" denotes that they are in an unhappy state when good is no longer conjoined with truths; this state is the last state of the church, 
but the former is its first state. [11] The like is signified in Matthew 25:1-12 by the bridegroom whom the ten virgins went forth to meet; for the virgins who had oil in their lamps denote those 
who have good in their truths, but those who had no oil in their lamps denote those who have no good in their truths (see n. 4638; and that "oil" denotes the good of love, n. 886, 3728, 4582). [12] 
In John: </p>
<p>     John said, I am not the Christ, but I am sent before Him. He that hath the bride is the bridegroom; but the friend of the bridegroom, who standeth and heareth him, rejoiceth with joy because 
of the bridegroom's voice (John 3:28-29); </p>
<p>"the bride" denotes the truth of faith of the church; and "the bridegroom" the good of love of the church, both from the Lord; thus they denote the man 
of the church with whom good has been conjoined with truths. From all this it is also plain what is meant in the internal sense by the "joy" and the "voice of the bridegroom and of the bride" in Isa. 
62:5; Jer. 7:34; 16:9; 25:10; 33:11; Rev. 18:23; namely, heaven and the happiness resulting from the conjunction of good and truth with man and angel. </p>

<p align="center"><b>Elliott(1983-1999) 9182</b></p><p><b>9182.</b>
'When a man persuades a virgin who is not betrothed' means good that has not been joined to truth. This is clear from the meaning of 'persuading', when said in reference to a man and a virgin, as his 
enticing her to be joined to him; from the meaning of 'a man' as truth, dealt with in <a href="3134.htm">3134</a>, <a href="7716.htm">7716</a>, <a href="9007.htm">9007</a>; from the meaning of 'a virgin' as the Church in respect of good, dealt with in <a href="3081.htm">3081</a>, <a href="4638.htm">4638</a>, thus 
the good which the Church is; and from the meaning of 'being betrothed' as being joined to. Something brief must be stated here about the law regarding a wrongful joining together, which is the subject 
at present - about where the cause and origin of that law lie. The cause of all the laws laid down for the children of Israel lies in heaven; and the laws of order there are the origin from which they 
spring. The laws of order in heaven all spring from Divine Truth and Goodness which emanate from the Lord, and therefore are laws concerning the good of love and the truth of faith. Goodness and truth 
joined together in heaven is called the heavenly marriage; and this marriage is represented in marriages on earth. It is also meant in the Word by marriages. From this one can see what is implied 
by wrongful joinings together, and also by cases of whoredom or adultery. The present two verses deal with a wrongful joining together which later on is either made rightful or else dissolved. A wrongful 
joining together which later on is made rightful is the subject in the present verse, and a wrongful joining together which later on is dissolved is the subject in the next.  </p>
<p></p>
<p><b>[2]</b>
 A wrongful joining 
together is one that takes place not as a result of a desire for marriage, but as a result of some other desire, such as an interest in good looks, monetary gain, or personal status, or else it 
is one that takes place as a result of sexual lust. Any such joining together is wrongful initially; it is wrongful because they are external attractions that draw the two people together and not at the 
same time internal ones. Nevertheless those external attractions may subsequently serve as the means towards a rightful joining together, which takes place when the two people are of one mind. They 
may also be the means of preventing a subsequent joining together from taking place if the two people are not of one mind. This is a matter commonly known in the world.  </p>
<p></p>
<p><b>[3]</b>
 A rightful joining together, 
which is a joining of minds, takes place when similar goodness and similar truth exist with both persons; for goodness and truth constitute a person's life, goodness and truth on the level of private 
and public behaviour constituting the life of the external man, and goodness and truth on a spiritual level constituting the life of the internal man. It should be recognized that a person's life 
springs from no other source than goodness and truth; for everything the person loves is called good, and everything the person believes is called truth. Or what amounts to the same thing, everything 
the person wills is called good, and everything the person understands is called truth. From this it is evident that a rightful joining together takes place when truth exists with one person in a marriage 
and the good which complements that truth exists in the other person. For when this is their relationship the heavenly marriage, which is a marriage of goodness and truth, is represented in the 
two of them. So it is that conjugial love descends from that marriage, see <a href="2727.htm">2727</a>-<a href="2759.htm">2759</a>, <a href="2803.htm">2803</a>, <a href="3132.htm">3132</a>, <a href="4434.htm">4434</a>, <a href="4835.htm">4835</a>.  </p>

 From all this, mentioned by way of introduction, anyone may recognize the nature 
of the joinings together dealt with in the present verse and the one following. Betrothal before marriage has been a custom since ancient times; it represented a first joining together, which is that 
of the internal man without the external. The actual marriage following it represented a second joining together, which is that of the internal man together with the external. For when a person is being 
regenerated by forms of the good and the truths of faith, the internal man is regenerated first and the external man afterwards, since the external man is regenerated from the internal, <a href="3286.htm">3286</a>, <a href="3321.htm">3321</a>, <a href="3493.htm">3493</a>, <a href="3882.htm">3882</a>, <a href="8746.htm">8746</a>.  </p>
<p></p>
<p><b>[5]</b>
 This shows what is meant in the Word by 'betrothal' and 'being betrothed', and also what is meant by 'bridegroom' and 'bride'. It shows that 'betrothal' means the joining together 
of truth and good in the internal man, and that where the Lord and the Church are the subject 'bridegroom' means good and 'bride' truth, as in the following places: In Jeremiah,  </p>
<blockquote>
I have remembered 
for you the mercy of your youth, the love of your betrothals, when you went out after Me in the wilderness, in a land not sown. <a href="http://bible.gospelcom.net/cgi-bin/bible?passage=Jer%202:2&amp;version=ESV&amp;interface=print&amp;showfn=yes&amp;showxref">Jer 2:2</a>.  
</blockquote>
<p>This refers to the Ancient Church and its establishment 
by the Lord. 'The love of betrothals' is the affection belonging to spiritual life that is received from the truths of faith and the good of love. A state of desire, when they were still without 
knowledge of those truths and lacked that good, is meant by 'going out after Me in the wilderness' and 'in a land not sown'.  </p>
<p></p>
<p><b>[6]</b>
 In Hosea,  </p>
<blockquote>
I will make for them a covenant on that day with the 
wild animals of the field, and with the birds of the air, and the creeping things of the earth. And I will abolish<A name="fntext1"></a><A href="#fn1"><sup>a</sup></a> the bow, and the sword, and war from the land. And I will betroth you to Me in righteousness

</blockquote>
<p>This refers to the establishment of a new Church. 'Making a covenant with the wild animals of the field, with the birds, 
and with the creeping things of the earth' means a joining together which the Lord accomplishes by means of the goodness and truth, internal and external, present with a person.  </p>

<p></p>
<p><b>[7]</b>
 'Betrothing in righteousness and in judgement' means being joined 
to the Lord in goodness and truth - 'betrothing' is joining to oneself, and 'righteousness' has reference to good, 'judgement' to truth, <a href="2235.htm">2235</a>. 'Betrothing in mercy and in compassion' means doing so out 
of love towards those governed by good, and in love towards those guided by truths - the Lord's 'mercy' has reference to His love towards those who lack good but nevertheless desire it, and His 'compassion' 
to His love towards those who have no knowledge of truth but nevertheless desire it. From all this it is evident that 'betrothal' means the joining together by the Lord of goodness and truth 
present with a person. Anyone can see that matters such as these are meant in those verses in Hosea, for when their contents are looked at in nothing brighter than natural light it is evident that Jehovah 
does not make a covenant with the wild animals of the field, the birds, and the creeping things of the earth, but with those possessing the goodness and truth of faith, thus with the goodness and 
truth present with a person, and therefore that such matters lie within this prophetic utterance.  </p>
<p></p>
<p><b>[8]</b>
 In Malachi,  </p>
<blockquote>
Judah has acted faithlessly, for he has profaned the holiness of Jehovah, for 
he loved and betrothed to himself the daughter of a foreign god. <a href="http://bible.gospelcom.net/cgi-bin/bible?passage=Mal%202:11&amp;version=ESV&amp;interface=print&amp;showfn=yes&amp;showxref">Mal 2:11</a>.  
</blockquote>
<p>'Betrothing the daughter of a foreign god' means being joined to the evil of falsity, 'a foreign god' being falsity, <a href="4402.htm">4402</a> 
(end), <a href="4544.htm">4544</a>, <a href="7873.htm">7873</a>.  </p>
<p></p>
<p><b>[9]</b>
 As regards the meaning of 'bridegroom' as good, where the Lord and the Church are the subject, and of 'bride' as truth, this may be seen in Isaiah,  </p>
<blockquote>
Jehovah has clothed 
me with the garments of salvation, with the robe of righteousness has He covered me, as a bridegroom puts on his priestly tiara, and as a bride adorns herself with her jewels.<A name="fntext3"></a><A href="#fn3"><sup>c</sup></a> <a href="http://bible.gospelcom.net/cgi-bin/bible?passage=Isa%2061:10&amp;version=ESV&amp;interface=print&amp;showfn=yes&amp;showxref">Isa 61:10</a>.  
</blockquote>
<p>In 
John,  </p>
<blockquote>
I saw the Holy City, New Jerusalem, coming down from God out of heaven, prepared as a bride adorned for her husband. <a href="http://bible.gospelcom.net/cgi-bin/bible?passage=Rev%2021:1,%202&amp;version=ESV&amp;interface=print&amp;showfn=yes&amp;showxref">Rev 21:1, 2</a>.  
</blockquote>
<p>In the same book,  </p>
<blockquote>
The angel said, Come, I will show 
you the bride, the Lamb's wife. <a href="http://bible.gospelcom.net/cgi-bin/bible?passage=Rev%2021:9;%2022:17&amp;version=ESV&amp;interface=print&amp;showfn=yes&amp;showxref">Rev 21:9; 22:17</a>.  
</blockquote>
<p>Here 'bride' stands for the Church.  </p>
<p></p>
<p><b>[10]</b>
 In Matthew,  </p>
<blockquote>
Jesus said to John's disciples, Can the sons of the wedding mourn as long as the bridegroom 
is with them? But the days will come when the bridegroom is taken away from them, and then they will fast. <a href="http://bible.gospelcom.net/cgi-bin/bible?passage=Matt%209:15&amp;version=ESV&amp;interface=print&amp;showfn=yes&amp;showxref">Matt 9:15</a>; <a href="http://bible.gospelcom.net/cgi-bin/bible?passage=Luke%205:34,%2035&amp;version=ESV&amp;interface=print&amp;showfn=yes&amp;showxref">Luke 5:34, 35</a>.  
</blockquote>
<p>The expression 'the sons of the wedding' refers to those 
who adhere to the truths of the Church and receive good, good which comes from the Lord being 'the bridegroom'. 'The sons of the wedding do not mourn as long as the bridegroom is with them' implies 
that they are in a state of bliss and happiness, and so are with the Lord, when they adhere to the truths joined to their good. 'They will fast when the bridegroom is taken away from them' implies that 
they are in a state of unhappiness when good is no longer joined to the truths. The latter state is the final state of the Church, whereas the former is the first state.  </p>
<p></p>
<p><b>[11]</b>
 Something similar 
is meant in <a href="http://bible.gospelcom.net/cgi-bin/bible?passage=Matthew%2025:1-12&amp;version=ESV&amp;interface=print&amp;showfn=yes&amp;showxref">Matthew 25:1-12</a> by the bridegroom, whom the ten virgins went out to meet. For the virgins who had oil in their lamps are people who have good within their truths; but the virgins who did 
not have oil in their lamps are people who do not have good within their truths, see <a href="4638.htm">4638</a>, 'oil' being the good of love, <a href="886.htm">886</a>, <a href="3722.htm">3722</a>, <a href="4582.htm">4582</a>.  </p>
<p></p>
<p><b>[12]</b>
 In John,  </p>
<blockquote>
John said, I am not the Christ, but I have 
been sent before Him. He who has the bride is the bridegroom; but the friend of the bridegroom, who stands and hears Him, rejoices greatly because of the bridegroom's voice. <a href="http://bible.gospelcom.net/cgi-bin/bible?passage=John%203:28,%2029&amp;version=ESV&amp;interface=print&amp;showfn=yes&amp;showxref">John 3:28, 29</a>.  
</blockquote>
<p>'The 
bride' stands for the truth that composes the Church's faith, and 'the bridegroom' for the good that composes the Church's love, both of which come from the Lord, and so stand for a member of the Church 
with whom good has been joined to truths. 'The friend of the bridegroom, who stands and hears' stands for faith consisting of truth, and 'who rejoices greatly because of the bridegroom's voice' stands 
for an affection for the truth composing faith. All this also shows what is meant in the internal sense by the joy and voice of the bridegroom and the bride in <a href="http://bible.gospelcom.net/cgi-bin/bible?passage=Isaiah%2062:5&amp;version=ESV&amp;interface=print&amp;showfn=yes&amp;showxref">Isaiah 62:5</a>; <a href="http://bible.gospelcom.net/cgi-bin/bible?passage=Jeremiah%207:34;%2016:9;%2025:10&amp;version=ESV&amp;interface=print&amp;showfn=yes&amp;showxref">Jeremiah 7:34; 16:9; 25:10</a>;

`Si quando persuaserit vir virgini, quae non desponsata': quod significet bonum non conjunctum vero, constat ex significatione `persuadere' cum de viro et virgine (o)dicitur, quod sit allicere ad conjunctionem, 
ex significatione `viri' quod sit verum, de qua n. 3134, 7716, 9007, ex significatione `virginis' quod sit Ecclesia quoad bonum, de qua n. 3081, 4638, ita bonum quod Ecclesia, et ex significatione 
`desponsari' quod sit conjunctio.  Paucis hic dicetur unde lex de illegitima conjunctione, de qua nunc agitur, causam et originem ducit {1}: omnes {2} leges latae filiis Israelis in caelo habent 
suam causam, et ex legibus ordinis ibi trahunt originem; leges ordinis in caelo sunt omnes ex Divino Vero et Bono quae procedunt a Domino, inde {3} sunt (o)leges boni amoris et {4} veri fidei; conjunctio 
boni et veri in caelo vocatur conjugium caeleste, et hoc repraesentatur in conjugiis in terra, et quoque per conjugia in Verbo significatur; inde patet quid involvunt conjunctiones illegitimae 
et quoque quid scortationes et adulteria; in his binis versibus agitur de illegitima conjunctione quae dein vel fit legitima, vel solvitur; de illegitima conjunctione quae dein fit legitima, agitur 
in hoc versu, et de illegitima conjunctione quae dein solvitur, agitur in versu sequente. 	[2] Illegitima conjunctio est quae fit non ex affectione conjugiali sed ex quacumque alia affectione, ut ex 
affectione pulchritudinis, ex affectione lucri, ex affectione dignitatis personae, et quoque quae fit ex lascivia; hae conjunctiones sunt illegitimae in principio, ex causa quia externa sunt quae conjungunt, 
et non simul interna; sed usque potest ex illis ut mediis postea fieri conjunctio legitima, quae fit cum conjunguntur animi, et quoque potest ex illis {5} postea fieri nulla conjunctio, quod {6} 
fit cum disjunguntur animi; quod ita sit, in mundo communiter notum est. 	[3] Conjunctio legitima, quae est animorum, fit cum ambo  in simili bono et vero sunt, nam bonum et verum faciunt vitam hominis, 
bonum et verum morale et civile vitam externi hominis, et {7} bonum et verum spirituale vitam interni hominis; sciendum quod vita hominis non aliunde sit quam ex bono et {8} vero, nam bonum dicitur 
omne id quod homo amat, et verum omne id quod homo credit; seu quod idem, bonum dicitur omne id quod homo vult, et verum omne id quod homo intelligit; inde patet quod legitima conjunctio `fit' cum 
unus conjugum in vero est {9} et altera in correspondente bono; sic enim in binis illis repraesentatur conjugium caeleste, quod est {10} boni et veri; inde est quod amor conjugialis ex illo conjugio

ante conjugia ab antiquis temporibus usu receptae fuerunt, et repraesentabant conjunctionem primam, quae est interni hominis absque externo; ipsa dein conjugia repraesentabant conjunctionem alteram,

tuarum, cum ivisti post Me in deserto, in terra non consita, ii 2; </p>
<p>ibi de Ecclesia Antiqua et de ejus instauratione a Domino; `amor desponsationum' est affectio vitae spiritualis, quae 
ex veris fidei et bono amoris est'; status desiderii, cum adhuc in ignorantia et defectu illorum (o)fuerunt, significatur per `ire post Me in deserto' et `in terra non consita': [6] apud Hoscheam, 	Feriam 
illis foedus in die illo {14} cum fera agri, et cum ave caelorum, et reptili terrae; et arcum et gladium et bellum frangam de terra; et desponsabo te Mihi in justitia et in judicio, et in misericordia 
et in miserationibus, ii (x)18, 19; </p>
<p>agitur ibi de instauratione Ecclesiae novae; `ferire foedus cum fera agri, cum ave, et cum reptili terrae' est conjunctio Domini per bonum et verum internum

[7] `desponsare in justitia et in judicio' est conjungi Domino in bono et vero; (o)`desponsare' est sibi conjungere, `justitia' {15} praedicatur de bono et `judicium' de vero, n. 2235; `desponsare

in desiderio boni, et miserationes' {18} erga illos qui in ignorantia et tamen in desiderio veri; ex his patet quod `desponsatio' sit conjunctio boni et veri apud hominem a Domino; (m)quisque {19} 
videre potest quod talia ibi significentur, nam coram perceptione solum ex naturali lumine patet quod Jehovah non feriat foedus cum fera agri, cum ave, ac cum reptili terrae, sed cum illis qui in bono 
et vero fidei sunt, ita cum bono et vero apud hominem, proinde quod talia in prophetico illo lateant {20}:(n) [8] apud Malachiam, 	Perfide egit Jehudah, quia profanavit sanctitatem Jehovae, quia amavit 
et desponsavit sibi filiam dei alieni, ii 11; </p>
<p>`desponsare filiam dei alieni' est conjungi malo falsi; `deus {21} alienus' est falsum, n. 4402 fin., 4544, 7873. 	[9] Quod `sponsus,' ubi agitur 
de Domino et de Ecclesia, sit bonum, et `sponsa' verum: apud Esaiam, 	Jehovah induit me vestibus salutis, amiculo justitiae texit me, sicut sponsus imponit cidarim, et sicut sponsa ornat se vasis suis, 
lxi 10: </p>
<p>apud Johannem, 	Vidi urbem sanctam Hierosolymam Novam descendentem a Deo e caelo, paratam sicut sponsam ornatam marito, Apoc. xxi 1, 2: </p>
<p>apud eundem, 	Dixit angelus, Veni, ostendam tibi 
sponsam Agni uxorem, Apoc. xxi 9, xxii 17 {22}; </p>
<p>[10] ibi `sponsa' pro Ecclesia: apud Matthaeum, 	Jesus dixit ad discipulos Johannis, Num possunt filii nuptiarum lugere quamdiu cum illis est sponsus? 
venient {23} autem dies quando (x)auferetur ab illis sponsus, et tunc jejunabunt, ix 15; et Luc. v 34, 35; </p>
<p>`filii nuptiarum' dicuntur illi {24} qui in veris Ecclesiae sunt et recipiunt bonum, nam bonum 
quod a Domino est `sponsus'; quod `filii nuptiarum non lugeant quamdiu cum illis (t)est sponsus' est quod in statu beato (c)ac felici sint, ita apud Dominum, cum in veris conjunctis suo bono {25}; 
{26} `jejunabunt cum aufertur ab illis sponsus' est quod in statu infelici cum non amplius bonum conjunctum est veris; hic status est status ultimus Ecclesiae, ille vero status primus. 	[11] Simile 
per sponsum, ad cujus occursum exiverunt decem virgines, significatur apud Matthaeum xxv 1-12; virgines enim quae oleum habebant in lampadibus sunt qui bonum in veris suis habent, at quae non oleum in 
lampadibus (o)habebant sunt qui {27} non bonum in veris (o)habent, videatur n. 4638; (o)et quod oleum sit bonum amoris, n. 886, 3722, (x)4582: [12] apud Johannem, 	Johannes dixit, Non sum ego Christus, 
sed quod missus coram Ipso; qui habet sponsam sponsus est; amicus autem sponsi, qui stat et audit Ipsum, gaudio gaudet ob vocem sponsi, iii 28, 29; </p>
<p>`sponsa' pro vero quod fidei Ecclesiae {28}, et 
`sponsus' pro (x)bono quod amoris Ecclesiae, utrumque a Domino {28}, ita pro homine Ecclesiae, apud quem conjunctum est bonum veris; `amicus sponsi, qui stat et audit' pro fide veri, qui gaudio gaudiet 
ob vocem sponsi' pro affectione veri quod fidei.  Ex his etiam patet quid in sensu interno intelligitur per gaudium et vocem sponsi et sponsae apud Esaiam (x)lxii 5; apud Jeremiam vii 34, xvi 9, xxv 
10, xxxiii 11; Apoc. xviii 23; quod nempe (o)sit caelum et felicitas {29} ex conjunctione boni et veri apud hominem et angelum. @1 Paucis dicetur unde haec lex de conjunctione illegitima causam ac
