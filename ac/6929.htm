<h3 align="center" class="ired">属天的奥秘 第6929节</h3>
<h4 align="center"></h4><p><strong>6929.</strong>当水星灵与我同在，我正在撰写并解释圣言的内义，他们发觉我写的东西时，他们说，我所写的这些事极其粗糙，几乎所有的表述都显得物质化。但我被允许回答说，我们地球人仍觉得我写的这些事精妙高深，其中许多东西是他们无法理解的。我补充说，在地球，许多人不知道内在人作用于外在人，并使外在人活着；他们出于感官幻觉确信肉体靠自己活着，因此当他的肉体死亡时，整个人就会死亡；他们以这种方式从心里怀疑死后的生命；他们还将人的肉体死后将要活着的那部分称为灵魂，而不是灵；他们争论什么是灵魂，它居于何处，认为它必再度与肉身结合，好叫人能活过来等等。当水星灵听到这些话时，他们问这种人能否成为天使。对此，我被允许回答说，那些活在信与仁之良善中的人会变成天使；当他们过这样的生活时，就不再关心外在和物质的事物，而是关心内在和属灵的事物；当达到这种状态时，他们所在的光要优于水星灵所在的光。为叫他们知道事实的确如此，一位来自我们地球已来到天堂的天使蒙允许与他们交谈，他活在世上时就是这样。后面我们会提到这位天使。</p>

When spirits of Mercury were with me while I was writing and unfolding the Word as to the internal sense, and perceived what I was writing, they said that the things I was writing were very gross, and 
that almost all the expressions appeared as it were material; but it was given to answer that to the men of our earth the things that have been written seem subtle and elevated, and many of them incomprehensible. 
I added that very many on this earth do not know that it is the internal man which acts upon the external, and causes this to live; and that they persuade themselves from fallacies of the 
senses that the body lives of itself, consequently that the whole man is to die when he dies as to the body, and in this way they cherish inward doubts as to the life after death; also that that part 
of man which is to live after the death of the body, they do not call the spirit, but the soul; and they dispute what the soul is, and where is its seat, and believe that it must be joined again to 
the material body, in order that the man may live, besides many like things. When the spirits of Mercury heard this, they asked whether such can become angels? to which it was given me to reply that 
those become angels who have lived in the good of faith, and in charity; and that then they are no longer in external and material things, but in internal and spiritual things, and that when they come 
to this state, they are in a light above that in which the spirits from Mercury are. To convince them that it is so, an angel was allowed to converse with them who was in heaven from our earth, and who 
had been such when he lived in the world, of which in what follows. </p>

When spirits belonging to Mercury have been present with me and I have been writing about and explaining the internal sense of the Word, and they have perceived what I wrote, they have said that the 
things I wrote were very broad generalities and that almost all the expressions seemed to be material. But I was allowed to reply that people belonging to our planet nevertheless see these things I have 
written as fine and exalted subjects, very many of which they cannot grasp. I added that the majority on our planet do not know that the internal man is what acts on the external man and makes it living; 
under the influence of sensory illusions they are convinced that the body lives of itself, consequently that the entire person will die when his body dies, and so they cause themselves to be in 
doubt about life after death. Nor, I went on, do they speak of the spirit but of the soul when they talk about that entity in the person which will be living after the death of the body, arguing over 
what the soul is and where it is seated, and believing that it has to be joined again to the material body if the person is to go on living, besides many more ideas like these. When the spirits belonging 
to Mercury heard all this they asked whether that kind of people could become angels. To this I was allowed to reply that those people become angels who have displayed the good of faith and charity 
in their lives, and that when they lead a life like that they are no longer interested in external and material values, only in internal and spiritual ones; and that when they attain this state they 
are in light superior to that which the spirits from Mercury see by. To enable them to know that this was true an angel who had arrived in heaven from our planet and who had been such when he lived 
in the world was allowed to talk to them. This angel will be spoken about later on.<A name="fntext1"></a><A href="#fn1"><sup>a</sup></a>

Spiritus Mercurii cum apud me essent, cum scriberem et explicarem Verbum quoad sensum ejus internum, et {1}perciperent quid scriberem, dicebant quod illa quae scriberem admodum crassa essent, et quod 
expressiones paene omnes {2}sicut materiales apparerent; sed respondere dabatur quod homines nostrae telluris usque videant haec quae scripta sunt sicut subtilia (c)et elevata, quorum plura nec capiunt; 
addebam quod perplures in hac tellure non sciant quod internus homo sit qui agit in externum, et facit ut {3}hic vivat, {4}persuadeantque sibi ex fallacia sensus quod corpus ex se vivat, consequenter 
quod moriturus sit totus homo cum moritur is quoad corpus, et sic vitam post mortem in dubio apud se ponunt; (m)tum quod {5}non vocent spiritum, sed animam illud hominis quod victurum post mortem 
corporis, et quod {6}litigent quid anima, et ubinam sedes ejus, credantque quod corpori materiali iterum conjungenda sit ut vivat homo;(n) praeter plura similia; cum haec audirent spiritus Mercurii, 
quaerebant {7} an tales {8}possunt angeli fieri; ad quae respondere datum est quod angeli fiant qui in bono fidei et charitate vixerunt; et quod tunc non amplius in externis et materialibus sint, sed 
in internis et spiritualibus, et cum ad illum statum veniunt, quod sint {9}in luce supra illam in qua {10}sunt spiritus ex Mercurio; {11}ut scirent quod ita esset, dabatur ut angelus {12}qui in caelo 
e nostra tellure, qui talis fuerat cum vixit in mundo, cum illis loqueretur, de quo in sequentibus. 	@1 percipiebant$ 	@2 materiales essent$ 	@3 corpus$ 	@4 credentes isti fallaciae$ 	@5 vocent animam
