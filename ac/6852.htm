<h3 align="center" class="ired">属天的奥秘 第6852节</h3>
<h4 align="center"></h4><p><strong>6852.</strong>“我已经听见他们从督工面前所发的哀声”表这种怜悯的帮助反对那些想迫使他们服侍的人。这从“哀声”、“听见”和“督工”的含义清楚可知。“哀声”是指祈求帮助（参看<a href="6801.htm">6801</a>节）。“听见”是指顺从和注意（<a href="5017.htm">5017</a>节），但当论及耶和华或主时，它表示给祈求怜悯的人带来祂怜悯的帮助；“听见”和前面（<a href="6851.htm">6851</a>节）的“看见”情况一样，即：主听见所有人，因而给所有人带来帮助，不过是照着各人的需要来提供；那些唯独为自己，因而为反对他人而向祂呼喊，祈求帮助的人，如恶人惯常所行的，也蒙主的垂听，但主不会给他们带来帮助；当祂不带来帮助时，经上就说祂“没有听见”。“督工”是指那些想迫使人们服侍的人，这一点从这些经文明显看出来：<br />众民必领他们，将他们带回本地，他们要辖制他们的督工。当耶和华使你脱离愁苦、烦恼并人勉强你做的苦工，得享安息的日子，你必题这诗歌论巴比伦王说：督工何竟止息！（以赛亚书<a href="http://39-27.cn/赛14.2.htm">14:2</a>-<a href="http://39-27.cn/赛14.4.htm">4</a>）<br />撒迦利亚书：<br />我必在我家的四围安营，使敌军不得任意往来，督工也不再从他们中间经过。（撒迦利亚书<a href="http://39-27.cn/亚9.8.htm">9:8</a>）<br />“督工”描述了那些索要贡品的人（列王记下<a href="http://39-27.cn/王下23.35.htm">23:35</a>；申命记<a href="http://39-27.cn/申15.3.htm">15:3</a>）。他们也是那些迫使人们按照贡品征求的要求作工的人。他们还被称为“贡品首领”（出埃及记<a href="http://39-27.cn/出1.11.htm">1:11</a>）；他们就是那些迫使人们服侍的人（参看<a href="6659.htm">6659</a>节）。</p>

<p align="center"><b>Potts(1905-1910) 6852</b></p><p><b>6852.</b>
And I have heard their cry from before their taskmasters. That this signifies the aid of mercy against those who desired to compel them to serve, is evident from the signification of a "cry," as being 
entreaty (see n. 6801); and from the signification of "to hear," as being to obey and notice (n. 5017); but when it is said of Jehovah or the Lord, it denotes to bring the aid of mercy to him who implores 
it. It is with hearing as it is above (n. 6851) with seeing, namely, that the Lord hears all, and thus brings aid to all, but according to the necessities. They who cry, and implore Him for themselves 
alone, and thus against others, as the wicked are wont to do; these also the Lord hears, but He does not bring them aid, and when He does not bring aid, it is said that He "does not hear"-and 
from the signification of "taskmasters," as being those who desire to compel to serve. That a "taskmaster" or "exactor" denotes one who compels to serve, is evident from these passages: </p>
<p>     The peoples 
shall take them, and bring them to their place, and they shall rule over their exactors. It shall come to pass in the day that Jehovah shall give thee rest from thy sorrow, and from thy trouble, and 
from the hard service wherein thou wast made to serve, that thou shalt utter this parable concerning the king of Babylon. How hath the exactor ceased! (Isa. 14:2-4).      I will encamp about My house 
because of the army, because of him that goeth and of him that returneth, that the exactor may not pass through upon them anymore (Zech. 9:8). They were called "exactors" who exacted tribute (2 Kings 
23:35; Deut. 15:3), and also they who compelled them to work according to the imposition of the tributes. They are also called "princes of tributes" (Exod. 1:11); that these are they who compelled 
them to serve may be seen above (n. 6659). </p>

'And have heard their cry from before their taskmasters' means the help of that mercy in opposition to those who wished to compel them to serve. This is clear from the meaning of 'cry' as a calling for 
help, dealt with in <a href="6801.htm">6801</a>; from the meaning of 'hearing' as obeying and discerning, dealt with in <a href="5017.htm">5017</a>, though when used in reference to Jehovah or the Lord 'hearing' is bringing the help of His mercy 
to the one calling out for it (the situation with 'hearing' is the same as that above in <a href="6851.htm">6851</a> with 'seeing', in that the Lord hears everyone and so brings help to everyone, but each according to his 
needs. Those who cry out to Him and call for help solely in support of themselves, and so in opposition to others, as the evil are accustomed to do, are also heard by the Lord, but He does not bring 
them help; and when He does not bring help it is said that He does not hear); and from the meaning of 'taskmasters' as those who wish to compel people to serve. The fact that 'a taskmaster' is one who 
compels another to serve is evident in Isaiah, </p>
<blockquote>
The peoples will take them and bring them to their place, and they will have dominion over their taskmasters. It will happen on the day on which Jehovah 
will give you rest, both from your turmoil and from your hard service in which you were made to serve, that you will declare this parable about the king of Babel, How the task master has ceased!

</blockquote>
<p>And in Zechariah, </p>
<blockquote>
I will pitch camp by My house with an army because of him who is leaving and returning, so that the taskmaster passes over them no more. <a href="http://bible.gospelcom.net/cgi-bin/bible?passage=Zech%209:8&amp;version=ESV&amp;interface=print&amp;showfn=yes&amp;showxref">Zech 9:8</a>. 
</blockquote>
<p>'Taskmasters' 
is used in <a href="2.htm">2</a> Kings 23:35; Deut. 15:3, to describe those who demanded tribute. They are also those who compelled people to do work required by the imposition of tributes; in Exod. 1:11 they are called 
'princes of tributes'. And for the fact that they are those who compel people to serve, see <a href="6659.htm">6659</a>. </p>

`Et clamorem illorum audivi a coram exactoribus illius': quod significet misericordiae opem contra illos qui ad serviendum adigere voluerunt, constat ex significatione `clamoris' quod sit imploratio, 
de qua n. 6801; ex significatione `audire' quod sit oboedire et appercipere, de qua n. 5017, at cum dicitur de Jehovah seu Domino, est {1}imploranti misericordiae opem ferre; se habet cum `audire' sicut 
supra n. 6851 cum `videre,' quod Dominus omnes audiat ac ita omnibus opem ferat, sed secundum necessitates; qui clamant {2}et implorant Ipsum pro se solis, ac ita contra alios, ut solent mali, hos 
quoque Dominus audit sed non illis opem fert; et cum non opem fert, dicitur quod non audiat; et ex significatione `exactorum' quod sint qui ad serviendum adigere volunt; quod `exactor' sit qui ad serviendum 
adigit, patet apud Esaiam, Accipient illos populi, et deducent illos ad locum suum, et dominabuntur exactoribus suis: fiet {3} in die quo quietem daturus est Jehovah tibi, et a commotione tua, 
et a servitute gravi, qua servire coactus es, ut enunties hanc parabolam de rege Babelis, Quomodo cessavit exactor! xiv 2-4: </p>
<p>et apud Zachariam, Castra ponam domui meae de exercitu propter abeuntem 
et redeuntem, ut non transeat amplius super eos exactor, ix 8: </p>
<p>`exactores' dicebantur qui exigebant tributa, 2 Reg. xxiii 35; Deut. xv 3; et quoque qui adigebant ad opus faciendum secundum impositionem 
tributorum; vocantur `principes tributorum' Exod. i 11; qui quod sint qui {4}ad serviendum adigerent, videatur n. 6659. 	@1 opem ex Misericordia$ 	@2 seu$ 	@3 i itaque$ 	@4 After adigerent$ </p>
