<h3 align="center" class="ired">属天的奥秘 第1493节</h3>
<h4 align="center"></h4><p><strong>1493.</strong>“她是你的妻子”表主应当拥有与属天之物联结的真理，而非其它真理。这从“妻子”的含义清楚可知，“妻子”表与属天之物联结的真理(对此，参看12:12）。如前所述，此处描述了主向着聪明、因而向着智慧前进所遵循的秩序，以便由于祂的神性本质是智慧本身，所以祂的人性本质也可以成为智慧本身。</p><br />

<p><strong>[NCE]1493.</strong> That she was your wife means that it would not be right for him to have any truth but truth that was wedded to something heavenly. This can be seen from the symbolism of a wife as truth that needs to couple with something heavenly, as discussed above at verse <a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_1493/bible_king-james-version_genesis_12_12" target=_top>12</a> [搂<a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_1493/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_1473" target=_top>1473</a>]. Again, what is depicted here is the plan by which the Lord advanced into understanding and from understanding into wisdom so that he would become wisdom itself throughout 钬?in regard to his human quality as well as his divine. </p>
<p align="center"><b>Potts(1905-1910) 1493</b></p><p><b>1493.</b>
That she was thy wife. That this signifies that He ought to have no other truth than that which was to be conjoined with what is celestial, is evident from the signification of a "wife," as being the 
truth that was to be conjoined with what is celestial (concerning which above, at verse 12). There is here described the order in which the Lord advanced to intelligence, and thus to wisdom; so that, 
as He was wisdom itself as to His Divine Essence, so He should become wisdom itself as to His Human Essence. </p>

<p align="center"><b>Elliott(1983-1999) 1493</b></p><p><b>1493.</b>
'She is your wife' means that he ought to possess no other truth than that which was to be joined to the celestial. This is clear from the meaning of 'a wife' as truth that is to be joined to the celestial, 
dealt with above at verse 12. Here, as has been stated, the order is described by which the Lord advanced to intelligence, and so to wisdom, to the end that His whole person might be Wisdom itself 
- as He was as to the Divine Essence He might also become as to the Human Essence. </p>

<p align="center"><b>Latin(1748-1756) 1493</b>
</p><b>1493.</b>
Quod 'uxor tua illa' significet quod non aliud verum habere deberet quam quod conjungeretur caelesti, constat ex significatione 'uxoris' quod sit verum quod conjungendum caelesti, de qua supra ad vers. 
12; describitur hic, ut dictum, ordo quo processit Dominus ad intelligentiam, et sic ad sapientiam, ut totus, sicut erat quoad Essentiam Divinam, etiam fieret quoad Humanam, Ipsa Sapientia. </p>
