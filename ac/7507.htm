<h3 align="center" class="ired">属天的奥秘 第7507节</h3>
<h4 align="center"></h4><p><strong>7507.</strong>“凡属以色列人的，一样都不死”表它们不会灭绝。这从“一样都不死”和“牲畜”的含义，以及“以色列人”的代表清楚可知：“一样都不死”是指不会灭绝；“不死”的“牲畜”是指信之真理和良善，如前所述（<a href="7502.htm">7502</a>节）；“以色列人”是指那些属于属灵教会的人。与那些属于属灵教会之人同在的信之良善和真理之所以不会死，是因为他们通过仁与神性结合，而神性是生命本身，是永恒的。凡与生命本身，以及永恒之物结合的，都不可能死亡或灭绝；而是永远存在，不断被完善。但与那些属于教会，却被诅咒之人同在的信之事物因没有与神性结合，因而没有生命在里面，故会死亡。因为它们就像没有生命的雕像。这些事物因没有生命，故在来世灭绝，也就是被夺走。</p>

<p align="center"><b>Potts(1905-1910) 7507</b></p><p><b>7507.</b>
And there shall nothing die of all that belongeth to the sons of Israel. That this signifies that they shall not be consumed, is evident from the signification of "not anything dying," as being not to 
be consumed; from the signification of "cattle," of which it is said that "they shall not die," as being the truth and good of faith (of which above, n. 7502); and from the representation of the sons 
of Israel, as being those who are of the spiritual church. That the goods and truths of faith which are with those who are of the church cannot die, is because they have been conjoined with the Divine 
by means of charity, and the Divine is life itself, and is eternal; and that which has been conjoined with life itself and with what is eternal, cannot die or be consumed; but remains to eternity, 
and is continually being perfected; the things that are of faith with those who are of the church and are being condemned, not having been conjoined with the Divine, and consequently having no life in 
them, die; for they are like images devoid of life, and which, not being alive, in the other life are consumed, that is, are carried off. </p>

<p align="center"><b>Elliott(1983-1999) 7507</b></p><p><b>7507.</b>
'And nothing will die of all that belongs to the children of Israel' means that they will not be annihilated. This is clear from the meaning of 'nothing dying' as not being annihilated; from the meaning 
of the livestock, in reference to which it is said that '[nothing] will die', as the truth and good of faith, dealt with above in <a href="7502.htm">7502</a>; and from the representation of 'the children of Israel' as those 
who belong to the spiritual Church. The reason why the forms of the good of faith and the truths of faith residing with those who belong to the Church cannot die is that they have been linked through 
charity to the Divine, and the Divine is life itself and He is eternal. Anything linked to life itself and to what is eternal cannot die or be annihilated. It remains for evermore, constantly being 
made more perfect. But because matters of faith residing with those who belong to the Church and are damned are not linked to the Divine, and do not consequently have life within them, they die; for 
they are like lifeless statues. And being lifeless those things are annihilated in the next life, that is, they are taken away.  </p>

</p><b>7507.</b>
`Et non morietur de omni filiis Israelis quicquam': quod significet quod non consumentur, constat ex significatione `non mori quicquam' quod sit non consumi; et ex significatione `pecoris' de quo dicitur 
quod non morietur, quod sit verum et bonum fidei, de qua supra n. 7502; et ex repraesentatione `filiorum Israelis' quod sint qui ab Ecclesia spirituali; quod non mori queant bona et vera fidei quae 
illis qui ab Ecclesia {1}, est quia per {2}charitatem conjuncta sunt cum Divino, (c)et Divinum est ipsa vita, et est {3} aeternum; quod ipsi vitae {4}ac aeterno conjunctum est, hoc non potest mori, 
seu non consumi; manet in aeternum, et continue {5}perficitur; at quae fidei sunt apud illos qui ab Ecclesia et damnantur, illa quia non conjuncta sunt cum Divino, {6}et inde non vitam in se habent, 
{7}moriuntur; sunt enim sicut simulacra nullius vitae; quae quia non viva, in altera vita consumuntur, hoc est, auferuntur. 	@1 i et salvantur$ 	@2 bonum charitatis sunt conjuncta$ 	@3 i ipsum$ 	@4
