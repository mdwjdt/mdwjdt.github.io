<h3 align="center" class="ired">属天的奥秘 第4043节</h3>
<h4 align="center"></h4><p><strong>4043.</strong>如前所述，更为内在，也就是更为普遍的内部形式之所以无法理解，是因为一提到这类形式，他们就沾染时空概念。而事实上，在天堂所在的内层，没有任何事物是通过空间和时间来感知的，因为这些属于自然界，而是通过状态的不同和变化来感知的。但由于人若不借助诸如与形式相关联的那类事物，或如前所述，离开诸如属于空间和时间的那类事物，就无法想象这些不同和变化，而这类事物在天上又不存在，故可以看出，它们是何等超出理解，又何等无法描述。由于描述并理解这些事物所借助的所有人类话语都涉及属世事物，所以它们并不适合表述这些事物。凭借主所放射的天堂之光和天堂火焰可以得知诸天中的这类事物；并且这些变化如此丰满，以致成千上万的感知几乎无法进入人所觉察到的任何事物。然而，诸天正在发生的事通过世上可见形式具有某种相似性的形式而展现在灵人界。</p>

The reason why the still more interior forms, which are also more universal, are as before said not comprehensible, is that when forms are mentioned, they carry with them the idea of space and also of 
time; and yet in the interiors, where heaven is, nothing is perceived by spaces and times, because these belong to nature, but by states and their variations and changes. But as the variations and changes 
cannot as before said be conceived by man without the aid of such things as are of form, and without such things as are of space and time, when yet these do not exist in the heavens, it may be 
seen how incomprehensible these things are, and also how unutterable. And as all human words, by means of which these things must be uttered and comprehended, involve natural things, they are inadequate 
to express them. In the heavens such things are presented to view by means of variations of heavenly light and heavenly flame, which are from the Lord; and this in such and so great a fullness, that 
thousands and thousands of perceptions could scarcely fall into anything that is perceptible by man. And yet the things that are taking place in the heavens are represented in the world of spirits by 
means of forms to which the forms seen in the world bear some resemblance. </p>

The reason why the still more interior forms, which are also more universal ones, are, as has been stated, beyond comprehension, is that when mention is made of such forms, these convey an idea that 
is spatial and also temporal. But in fact within interior things, where heaven exists, nothing is perceived through spatial and temporal things since these belong properly to the natural order, but through 
states and variations and changes of states. But since man is unable to conceive of variations and changes without the help of such things as are connected with form, or as has been stated, to conceive 
of forms without such things as belong to space and time - and yet such do not exist in the heavens - it may therefore be seen how far beyond comprehension they are and also how indescribable. 
Nor also are any human words adequate to express those things which need to be described and comprehended, because human words entail natural images. In the heavens such things are made known by means 
of variations of heavenly light and of heavenly flame radiating from the Lord, which do so in such great fullness that thousands and thousands of perceptions could scarcely pass into anything perceptible 
with man. Nevertheless the things which are taking place in the heavens are represented in the world of spirits by means of forms to which the forms seen in the world bear some resemblance. </p>

</p><b>4043.</b>
Quod formae adhuc interiores, quae etiam universaliores sunt, non comprehensibiles sint, ut dictum, est causa quia formae cum nominantur, secum ferunt ideam spatii et quoque temporis, cum tamen in 
interioribus ubi est caelum, non percipitur aliquid per spatia et per tempora, quia haec propria sunt naturae, sed per status et eorum variationes et mutationes; at quia variationes et mutationes 
nec concipi possunt ab homine absque talibus quae sunt formae, et formae, ut dictum, non absque talibus quae sunt spatii et temporis, cum tamen talia non sunt in caelis, inde constare potest, quam 
incomprehensibilia sunt illa, et quoque quam ineffabilia; omnes {1}quoque voces humanae quibus illa effanda et comprehendenda sunt, quia naturalia involvunt, nec adaequatae sunt exprimendis illis; 
in caelis talia sistuntur per variationes lucis caelestis, et flammae caelestis quae a Domino, et hoc in tali et tanta plenitudine, ut millia et millia perceptionum vix cadere possent in aliquid perceptibile 
apud hominem: sed usque illa quae in caelis fiunt, repraesentantur in mundo spirituum per formas, ad quas similitudine accedunt formae quae in mundo apparent. @1 etiam$ </p>
