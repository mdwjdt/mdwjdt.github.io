<h3 align="center" class="ired">属天的奥秘 第9296节</h3>
<h4 align="center"></h4><p><strong>9296.</strong>“并在年底收集你从田间劳作所得时，要守收集节”表由于之后良善的植入，因而由于重生和从诅咒中完全释放而出于感恩之心的敬拜。这从“节”、“收集”、“年底”和“收集你从田间劳作所得时”的含义清楚可知：“节”是指敬拜主和感恩，如前所述（<a href="9286.htm">9286</a>，<a href="9287.htm">9287</a>，<a href="9294.htm">9294</a>节），因而是指出于感恩之心的敬拜；“收集”当论及真理在良善中的植入时，是指良善本身的植入；“年底”是指劳碌的结束；“收集你从田间劳作所得时”是指享受并使用已经被植入良善的一切事物。因为“劳作”不仅表示田间的出产，还表示葡萄园和橄榄园的出产，因而表示大地的出产；这从摩西五经中对这个节日的描述明显看出来：<br />你从禾场上和酒榨中收集以后，就要举行住棚节七日。耶和华你神在你一切的出产上，和你手里所办的一切事上必赐福与你。（申命记<a href="http://39-27.cn/申16.13.htm">16:13</a>，<a href="http://39-27.cn/申16.15.htm">15</a>）<br />利未记：<br />又在七月十五日，你们收集了地的出产后，要守耶和华的节七日。（利未记<a href="http://39-27.cn/利23.39.htm">23:39</a>）<br />由于这节日表示由于良善的植入，因而由于从诅咒中完全释放而出于感恩之心敬拜主，所以有必要首先在此解释一下什么叫良善的植入。前面各处早已说明，人有两种生命官能，即理解力和意愿；理解力专门用来接受真理，意愿专门用来接受良善。因为在整个宇宙，无论天堂还是世界，一切事物都与两样事物有关，即真理和良善。由此也明显可知，这二者构成一个人的生命，信之真理和仁之良善则构成他的新生命，如果这二者没有被植入人，他就没有新生命。至于信之真理以哪种方式被播种并植入一个人，这在教会是众所周知的；只是尚不清楚仁之良善以哪种方式被植入。当一个人还是一个小孩子时，他从主接受良善，这良善就是纯真之良善，就是诸如小孩子所拥有的那种。这良善构成人里面新意愿的最初开端，并在接下来的年龄阶段，照着他在同龄人当中所过的纯真生活，以及生活中的举止得体和对父母、老师的顺从而发展。然而，它在那些后来让自己重生的人身上发展得更充分。主预见这一切，并照着他们随后的生活状态而作准备。因为主每时每刻都预见邪恶，提供良善；祂从此人成孕的那一刻起，甚至直到永恒都如此行。后来，当此人长大成人，开始自主思考时，他在何等程度上陶醉于爱自己爱世界的快乐，这新意愿，也就是一个新意愿的最初开端就在何等程度上被关闭；他在何等程度上没有陶醉于这些快乐，它就在何等程度上被打开，还被完善。<br />不过，接下来有必要说明，它如何通过真理的植入而得以完善。由纯真之良善所形成的这新意愿是主进入一个人，与他同住，激发他去意愿良善并出于意愿实行良善所经由的居所。这种流注照着一个人避免邪恶的程度而在他里面起作用。他通过该流注拥有知道、觉察、反思和理解真理和良善的能力。这些真理和良善出现在私人和公众生活的层面，他照着功用或服务的快乐而获得这种能力。此后，主经由这良善流入此人从教会的教义所知道的真理，然后从他的记忆中召唤出能服务于生活中的功用的那类真理，并将这些真理植入良善，从而完善良善。正因如此，与一个人同在的良善完全取决于他在生活中的功用或服务。如果这种功用或服务是为了邻舍的利益，也就是说，为了同胞、国家、教会、天堂的良善，为了主，那么这种良善就是仁之良善。但是，如果他在生活中的功用或服务仅仅是为了自我和世界，那么这些新意愿的最初开端就被关闭了。在它们下面会有一种意愿从爱自己爱世界的邪恶形成，一种理解力则由此从虚假形成。这后一种意愿上面是关闭的，下面是敞开的，也就是说，向天堂关闭，向世界敞开。由此明显可知真理是如何被植入良善并赋予它形式的；还明显可知当一个人处于良善时，他就与主同在天堂；因为如前所述，新的意愿，就是仁之良善所住的地方，就是主的居所，因而就是一个人里面的天堂。从它延伸出来的新理解力可以说是祂进出所经由的一个帐幕。<br />这类事，无论总体还是细节，就由这个节日来代表，就是地上出产的收集节，又被称为住棚节。事实就是这样，这一点从这个节日的设立明显看出来；对此，摩西五经如此记着说：<br />又在七月十五日，你们收集了地的出产后，要守耶和华的节七日。第一日为一个安息日，第八日也为一个安息日。第一日，你们要为自己拿美好树上的果子和棕树上的枝子，与茂密树的枝条，并激流中的柳枝，在耶和华你们的神面前欢乐七日。你们要住在棚里七日，所有本地的以色列人，都要住在棚里，好叫你们世世代代知道我领以色列人出埃及地的时候，曾使他们住在棚里。（利未记<a href="http://39-27.cn/利23.39.htm">23:39</a>-<a href="http://39-27.cn/利23.43.htm">43</a>）<br />申命记：<br />你从禾场上和酒榨中收集以后，就要举行住棚节七日。在这节期中，你和你儿女、仆婢，并住在你城门内的利未人，以及寄居的与孤儿寡妇，都要欢乐。你就要非常的欢乐。（申命记<a href="http://39-27.cn/申16.13.htm">16:13</a>-<a href="http://39-27.cn/申16.15.htm">15</a>）<br />当良善被主通过真理植入时的状态，因而当天堂与一个人同住时的状态由这个节日来代表，这一点从此处所提及的一切事物的内义明显看出来，即：“七月十五日”表示前一个状态的结束和一个新状态的开始（“第十五”就具有这种含义参看<a href="8400.htm">8400</a>节；“第七”也是，<a href="728.htm">728</a>，<a href="6508.htm">6508</a>，<a href="8976.htm">8976</a>，<a href="9228.htm">9228</a>节）；那时所收集的地的出产表示仁之良善（<a href="43.htm">43</a>，<a href="55.htm">55</a>，<a href="913.htm">913</a>，<a href="983.htm">983</a>，<a href="2846.htm">2846</a>，<a href="2847.htm">2847</a>，<a href="3146.htm">3146</a>，<a href="7690.htm">7690</a>，<a href="7692.htm">7692</a>节）。从禾场上和酒榨中具有相同的含义。因为五谷，就是禾场的产物是指真理之良善（<a href="5295.htm">5295</a>，<a href="5410.htm">5410</a>节）；酒，就是酒榨的产物，是指源于良善的真理（<a href="6377.htm">6377</a>节）；油，也是压榨的产物，是指系真理的一个源头的良善（<a href="886.htm">886</a>，<a href="3728.htm">3728</a>，<a href="4582.htm">4582</a>，<a href="4638.htm">4638</a>节）。“第一日为一个安息日，第八日也为一个安息日”表示真理与良善的结合，以及良善与真理的相互结合，“安息日”表示结合在一起的真理和良善（参看<a href="8495.htm">8495</a>，<a href="8510.htm">8510</a>，<a href="8890.htm">8890</a>，<a href="8893.htm">8893</a>，<a href="9274.htm">9274</a>节）；第八日之所以也被称为“一个安息日”，是因为“第八”表示一个新状态的开始（<a href="2044.htm">2044</a>，<a href="8400.htm">8400</a>e节）。<br />他们在第一日所要拿的“美好树上的果子”表示欢乐和喜悦，因为良善被植入了，这就是为何接下来经上说“在耶和华面前欢乐”；“棕树上的枝子”表示该良善的内在真理（<a href="8369.htm">8369</a>节）；“茂密树的枝条”表示良善的外在真理，也就是记忆知识（<a href="2831.htm">2831</a>，<a href="8133.htm">8133</a>节）；“激流中的柳枝”表示更为外在的真理，也就是身体感官的真理，属于身体感官所接受的印象。他们要在里面住七日的棚表示从主所获得并作为回报又献给主的爱之圣洁（参看<a href="414.htm">414</a>，<a href="1102.htm">1102</a>，<a href="2145.htm">2145</a>，<a href="2152.htm">2152</a>，<a href="3312.htm">3312</a>，<a href="3391.htm">3391</a>，<a href="4391.htm">4391</a>，<a href="4599.htm">4599</a>节）；它还表示合一的圣洁（参看<a href="8666.htm">8666</a>节）。本地的以色列人表示那些处于仁之良善的人，从抽象意义上说，是指该良善（<a href="3654.htm">3654</a>，<a href="4598.htm">4598</a>，<a href="5801.htm">5801</a>，<a href="5803.htm">5803</a>，<a href="5806.htm">5806</a>，<a href="5812.htm">5812</a>，<a href="5817.htm">5817</a>，<a href="5819.htm">5819</a>，<a href="5826.htm">5826</a>，<a href="5833.htm">5833</a>，<a href="6426.htm">6426</a>，<a href="7957.htm">7957</a>节）。那时所有人的欢乐表示诸如那些处于从主所获得的良善之人所感受，因而诸如那些在天堂里的人所拥有的那种喜乐。因为一个处于从主所获得的仁之良善的人与主同在天堂。这些就是这个节日为之所设立的事。</p>

<p align="center"><b>Potts(1905-1910) 9296</b></p><p><b>9296.</b>
And the feast of ingathering, in the going out of the year, when thou gatherest in thy works out of the field. That this signifies worship from a grateful mind on account of the implantation of good 
therefrom, thus on account of regeneration and complete liberation from damnation, is evident from the signification of "a feast," as being the worship of the Lord and thanksgiving (of which above, n. 
9286, 9287, 9294), thus worship from a grateful mind; from the signification of "ingathering," when said of the implantation of truth in good, as being the implantation of good itself; from the signification 
of "the going out of the year," as being the end of the works; and from the signification of "when thou gatherest in thy works out of the field," as being the enjoyment and use of all things 
that have been implanted in good. For, by "the works" are signified not only the things of the field, but also those of the vineyard and the oliveyard, consequently those of the fruit of the earth; as 
is evident from the description of this feast in Moses: </p>
<p>     Thou shalt make for thee the feast of tabernacles seven days, after thou hast gathered in from thy threshing-floor and from thy winepress. 
And Jehovah thy God shall bless thee in all thy produce, and in every work of thy hands (Deut. 16:13, 15).       On the fifteenth day of the seventh month, when ye have gathered in the fruit of the 
land, ye shall keep the feast of Jehovah seven days (Lev. 23:39). [2] As by this feast is signified the worship of the Lord from a grateful mind on account of the implantation of good, and thus on account 
of complete liberation from damnation, it shall first be explained what the implantation of good is. It has already been everywhere shown that man has two faculties of life, namely, the understanding 
and the will; and that the understanding is allotted to the reception of truth, and the will to the reception of good; for there are two things to which all things in the universe, both in heaven 
and in the world, bear relation, namely, truth and good. From this it is also evident that these two make the life of man, and that the truth of faith and the good of charity make his new life, and 
that unless both of these have been implanted in man he has no new life. In what way the truth which is of faith is sown and implanted in man, is known in the church; but it is not as yet so well known 
in what way the good which is of charity is implanted. When he is a little child, man receives good from the Lord, and this good is the good of innocence, such as little children have. This good makes 
the beginning of the new will in man, and in the succeeding age it grows in accordance with his life of innocence with his companions and in accordance with his life of goodness and obedience toward 
his parents and masters, but still more with those who afterward suffer themselves to be regenerated. This the Lord foresees, and provides according to the state of life that follows; for in every 
present moment the Lord foresees evil, and provides good; and this He does from the first thread of life even to eternity. Afterward, when the man grows up and begins to think from himself, so far as 
he is then carried away by the delights of the loves of self and of the world, so far this new willing, or beginning of a new will, is closed; and so far as he is not carried away by these delights, so 
far it is opened, and is also perfected.  [3] But how it is perfected by the implantation of truth, shall now be told. This new will, which is from the good of innocence, is the dwelling place through 
which the Lord enters into man and excites him to will what is good, and from willing to do it. This influx works in the man in proportion as he desists from evils. From this he has the faculty of 
knowing, of perceiving, reflecting upon, and understanding moral and civil truths and goods in accordance with the delight of use. Afterward the Lord flows in through this good into the truths of doctrine 
of the church with the man, and calls forth from the memory such as are of service to the use of life, and implants these in the good, and so perfects the good. It is from this that the good with 
a man is wholly in accordance with the use of life. If the use of life is for the neighbor (that is, for the good of our fellow citizen, of our country, of the church, of heaven), and for the Lord, 
then this good is the good of charity. But if the use of life is only for self and the world, then this beginning of the new will is closed, and beneath it is formed a will from the evils of the loves 
of self and of the world, and from this an understanding is formed of falsities. This latter will is closed above and open beneath, that is, closed to heaven and open to the world. From all this it is 
evident how truths are planted in good, and form it; and also that when a man is good he is in heaven with the Lord; for as before said, the new will, in which is the good of charity, is the dwelling 
place of the Lord, and consequently is heaven in man; and the new understanding thence derived is as it were the tabernacle through which He comes in and goes out. [4] Such are the things in general 
and in particular that were represented by the feast, which was called "the feast of the ingathering of the fruits of the earth," and "the feast of tabernacles." That this is the case, is evident from 
the institution of this feast, of which in Moses: </p>
<p>     On the fifteenth day of the seventh month, when ye have gathered in the fruit of the earth, ye shall keep the feast of Jehovah seven days; on 
the first day is a Sabbath, and on the eighth day a Sabbath. And ye shall take you on the first day the fruit of the tree of honor, branches of palm trees, and a bough of the dense tree, and willows 
of the torrent; and ye shall be glad before Jehovah your God seven days. All the homeborn of Israel shall dwell in tabernacles, that your generations may know that I made the sons of Israel to dwell in 
tabernacles when I led them forth out of the land of Egypt. (Lev. 23:39-43).      Thou shalt make for thee the feast of tabernacles seven days, after thou hast gathered in from thy threshing-floor 
and from thy winepress; thou shalt be glad in that feast, thou, and thy son, and thy daughter, and thy manservant, and thy maidservant, and the Levite, and the sojourner, and the orphan, and the widow, 
that are within thy gates. Thou shalt be wholly glad (Deut. 16:13-15). [5] That a state of good implanted by means of truth by the Lord, thus a state of heaven in man, was represented by this feast, 
is plain from the internal sense of all the things here mentioned. For in this sense by "the fifteenth day of the seventh month" is signified the end of a former state and the beginning of a new state 
(that "fifteenth" has this signification, see, n. 8400; as also "seventh," n. 728, 6508, 8976, 9228); by "the fruit of the earth which had been gathered in" is signified the good of charity (n. 43, 
55, 913, 983, 2846, 2847, 3146, 7690, 7692). The like is signified by "the gathering in from the threshing-floor denotes the good of truth (n. 5295, 5410); the wine of the winepress denotes truth from 
good (n. 6377); and the oil which is also of the press denotes the good from which is truth (n. 886, 3728, 4582, 4638). By "a Sabbath on the first day, and a Sabbath on the eighth day" is signified 
the conjunction of truth with good, and reciprocally of good with truth (that "the Sabbath" denotes the conjunction of truth and good, see n. 8495, 8510, 8890, 8893, 9274); that the eighth day was also 
called "a Sabbath" is because by "the eighth" was signified the beginning of a new state (n. 2044, 8400). [6] By "the fruit of the tree of honor," which they were to take on the first day, was signified 
festivity and joy on account of good implanted, wherefore the words follow, "that ye may be glad before Jehovah;" by "the branches of palm-trees" are signified the internal truths of this good (n. 
8369); by "the bough of the dense (or interwoven) tree" are signified the external truths of good, that is, memory-knowledges (n. 2831, 8133); and by "the willows of the torrent," truths still more 
external, which are those of the bodily senses. By "the tabernacles in which they were to dwell seven days" is signified the holiness of love from the Lord and reciprocally to the Lord (see n. 414, 1102, 
2145, 2152, 3312, 3391, 4391, 4599; and that it denotes the holiness of union, n. 8666). By "the homeborn of Israel" are signified those who are in the good of charity, thus abstractedly this good 
(n. 3654, 4598, 5801, 5803, 5806, 5812, 5817, 5819, 5826, 5833, 6426, 7957); by the "gladness" of all then was signified joy such as those have who are in good from the Lord, thus such as those have 
who are in heaven; for he who is in the good of charity from the Lord is in heaven with the Lord. These are the things for the sake of which this feast was instituted. </p>

'And the feast of ingathering at the end of the year, when you have gathered in [the fruit of] your labours from the field' means the worship of a thankful mind on account of the implanting of good after 
that, and so on account of regeneration and complete deliverance from damnation. This is clear from the meaning of 'the feast' as worship of the Lord and thanksgiving, dealt with above in <a href="9286.htm">9286</a>, <a href="9287.htm">9287</a>, <a href="9294.htm">9294</a>, and so the worship of a thankful mind; from the meaning of 'ingathering', when speaking of the implanting of truth in good, as the implanting of good itself; from the meaning of 'the end of 
the year' as the end of labours; and from the meaning of 'when you have gathered in [the fruit of] your labours from the field' as the enjoyment and use of all that has been planted in good. For not 
only products of the field are meant by 'labours' but also those of the vineyard and the olive-grove, so that the fruits of the earth are meant, as is evident from the description of this feast in Moses, 
 </p>
<blockquote>
You shall celebrate the feast of tabernacles seven days, when you gather in from your threshing-floor, and from your winepress. And Jehovah your God will bless you in all your produce, and in 
all the labour of your hands. <a href="http://bible.gospelcom.net/cgi-bin/bible?passage=Deut%2016:13,%2015&amp;version=ESV&amp;interface=print&amp;showfn=yes&amp;showxref">Deut 16:13, 15</a>.

<p>And elsewhere,  </p>
<blockquote>
On the fifteenth day of the seventh month, when you have gathered in the fruit of the earth, you shall keep the feast of Jehovah seven 
days. <a href="http://bible.gospelcom.net/cgi-bin/bible?passage=Lev%2023:39&amp;version=ESV&amp;interface=print&amp;showfn=yes&amp;showxref">Lev 23:39</a>.  
</blockquote>
<p></p>
<p><b>[2]</b>
 Since this feast means worshipping the Lord with a thankful mind on account of the implanting of good, and so on account of complete deliverance from damnation, what the 
implanting of good is must first be explained here. It has been shown in various places already that a person has two powers of life - the understanding and the will - and that the understanding is dedicated 
to receiving truth and the will to receiving good. For there are two realities to which all things throughout creation, both in heaven and in the world, have connection, namely truth and good. 
From this it is also evident that these two realities compose a person's life, that the truth of faith and the good of charity compose his new life, and that unless they have both been implanted in 
the person he has no new life. In what way the truth of faith is sown and implanted in a person is well known in the Church, but in what way the good of charity is, is not as yet so well known. When a 
person is a young child he receives good from the Lord, that good being the good of innocence as it exists with young children. This good composes the first beginnings of a new will with a person, and 
it develops in the next period of life in the measure that he leads an innocent life among those of his own age, behaves properly in life and does what he is told by parents and teachers. It develops 
more fully however with those who subsequently allow themselves to be regenerated. This the Lord foresees, and according to the state of their subsequent life He makes provision for it. For in every 
present moment the Lord foresees what is bad and provides what is good; He does so from the moment the person is conceived even into eternity. At a later stage, when the person has grown up and starts 
to think from self, then to the extent that he is carried away by the delights of self-love and love of the world that new will, that is, first beginnings of a new will, is closed, and to the extent 
that he is not carried away by those delights it is opened and also perfected.  </p>
<p></p>
<p><b>[3]</b>
 But in what way it is perfected through the implanting of truth must be stated next. That new will, which is formed 
from the good of innocence, is the dwelling-place by means of which the Lord comes in and resides with a person, rousing the person to will what is good, and from willing good to doing it. This influx 
is effective with a person to the extent that he refrains from evils. It gives him the ability to know, see into, reflect on, and have an understanding of truths and forms of good. The truths and 
forms of good occur on the level of both private and public life, and he receives that ability according to his delight in service. After this the Lord flows by way of that good into the truths the person 
knows from the teachings of the Church; He then summons from his memory the kinds of truths that may help him serve usefully in life, implanting those truths in the good and perfecting it. So it 
is that the good present with a person depends entirely on his service in life. If that service is rendered for his neighbour's benefit, that is, for the good of fellow-citizen, country, Church, heaven, 
and for the Lord, then that good is the good of charity. But if his service in life is rendered solely for the sake of self and the world, then those first beginnings of a new will are closed. Below 
them a will is formed from the evils of self-love and love of the world, and arising from this an understanding from falsities. This will is closed above and open below, that is, it is closed in heaven's 
direction and open in the world's. All this shows in what way truths are planted in good and give it form. It also shows that when a person is governed by good he is in heaven with the Lord; for 
as stated above, the new will, where the good of charity resides, is the Lord's dwelling-place and is therefore heaven with a person. And the new understanding extending from it is so to speak a tabernacle 
or booth through which people pass in and out.  </p>
<p></p>
<p><b>[4]</b>
 These kinds of things in general and in particular were represented by this feast, which was a feast of ingathering of the fruits of the 
earth, and was called the feast of tabernacles. The establishment of this feast, spoken of in Moses as follows, shows that this is so,  </p>
<blockquote>
On the fifteenth day of the seventh month, when you have gathered 
in the fruit of the earth, you shall keep the feast of Jehovah seven days; on the first day there shall be a sabbath, and on the eighth day a sabbath. And you shall take for yourselves on the first 
day the fruit of a fine tree,<A name="fntext1"></a><A href="#fn1"><sup>a</sup></a> fronds of palm trees, and the bough of a thick tree, and willows of the powerful stream; and you shall be glad before Jehovah your God seven days. You shall dwell in 
tabernacles seven days. All native Israelites shall dwell in tabernacles, that your generations may know that I caused the children of Israel to dwell in tabernacles when I brought them out of the land 
of Egypt. <a href="http://bible.gospelcom.net/cgi-bin/bible?passage=Lev%2023:39-44&amp;version=ESV&amp;interface=print&amp;showfn=yes&amp;showxref">Lev 23:39-44</a>.  
</blockquote>
<p>And elsewhere,  </p>
<blockquote>
You shall celebrate the feast of tabernacles seven days, when you gather in from your threshing-floor, and from your press. You shall be glad in your 
feast, you and your son and your daughter and your male slave and your female slave and the Levite and the sojourner and the orphan and the widow who are within your gates. And you will be altogether 
glad. <a href="http://bible.gospelcom.net/cgi-bin/bible?passage=Deut%2016:13-15&amp;version=ESV&amp;interface=print&amp;showfn=yes&amp;showxref">Deut 16:13-15</a>.

 The state when good has been implanted by the Lord through truth, thus the state when heaven resides with a person, was represented by this feast. This is evident from the 
internal sense of all that is mentioned in these passages, which is this: The fifteenth day of the seventh month means the end of the former state and the beginning of a new state. (That this is the 
meaning of the fifteenth, see <a href="8400.htm">8400</a>, and also of the seventh, <a href="728.htm">728</a>, <a href="6508.htm">6508</a>, <a href="8976.htm">8976</a>, <a href="9228.htm">9228</a>.) The fruit of the earth, which had been gathered in by then, means the good of charity, <a href="43.htm">43</a>, <a href="55.htm">55</a>, <a href="913.htm">913</a>, <a href="983.htm">983</a>, <a href="2846.htm">2846</a>, <a href="2847.htm">2847</a>, 
<a href="3146.htm">3146</a>, <a href="7690.htm">7690</a>, <a href="7692.htm">7692</a>. Gathering in from the threshing-floor and from the press has a similar meaning. For grain, which is a product of the threshing-floor, is the good of truth, <a href="5295.htm">5295</a>, <a href="5410.htm">5410</a>; wine, which 
is a product of the press, is truth derived from good, <a href="6377.htm">6377</a>; and oil, which is also a product of the press, is good which is a source of truth, <a href="886.htm">886</a>, <a href="3728.htm">3728</a>, <a href="4582.htm">4582</a>, <a href="4638.htm">4638</a>. A sabbath on the first day and a 
sabbath on the eighth day mean the joining of truth to good, and in a reciprocal manner the joining of good to truth, the sabbath meaning truth and good joined together, <a href="8495.htm">8495</a>, <a href="8510.htm">8510</a>, <a href="8890.htm">8890</a>, <a href="8893.htm">8893</a>, <a href="9274.htm">9274</a>. 
The reason why the eighth day too was called a sabbath is that eighth meant the beginning of a new state, <a href="2044.htm">2044</a>, <a href="8400.htm">8400</a> (end).  </p>

 The fruit of a fine tree which they were to take on the first day meant 
festivity and joy because good had been implanted, which is why the words you shall be glad before Jehovah follow; fronds of palm trees meant internal truths of that good, <a href="8369.htm">8369</a>; the bough of a thick 
(or tangled) tree meant relatively external truths of good, or known facts, <a href="2831.htm">2831</a>, <a href="8133.htm">8133</a>; and willows of the powerful stream meant rather more external truths, which belong to impressions received by 
the bodily senses. The tabernacles in which they were to dwell seven days means the holiness of love received from the Lord and offered in return to the Lord, <a href="414.htm">414</a>, <a href="1102.htm">1102</a>, <a href="2145.htm">2145</a>, <a href="2152.htm">2152</a>, <a href="3312.htm">3312</a>, <a href="3391.htm">3391</a>, <a href="4391.htm">4391</a>, 
<a href="4599.htm">4599</a>, also the holiness of union, <a href="8666.htm">8666</a>. Native Israelites means those governed by the good of charity, and therefore also means - in the abstract sense - that good, <a href="3654.htm">3654</a>, <a href="4598.htm">4598</a>, <a href="5801.htm">5801</a>, <a href="5803.htm">5803</a>, <a href="5806.htm">5806</a>, <a href="5812.htm">5812</a>, 
<a href="5817.htm">5817</a>, <a href="5819.htm">5819</a>, <a href="5826.htm">5826</a>, <a href="5833.htm">5833</a>, <a href="6426.htm">6426</a>, <a href="7957.htm">7957</a>. The rejoicing of all at that time meant the joy such as that felt by those who are governed by good received from the Lord, thus such as that felt by those in heaven. 
For one who is governed by the good of charity received from the Lord is in heaven with the Lord. These are the things on account of which that feast was established.

`Et festum collectionis in exitu anni, in colligendo te opera tua ex agro': quod significet cultum ex grato animo ob implantationem boni inde, ita ob regenerationem et plenariam liberationem a damnatione, 
constat ex significatione `festi' quod sit cultus Domini et gratiarum actio, de qua supra n. 9286, 9287, 9294, ita cultus ex grato animo; ex significatione `collectionis' cum de implantatione veri 
in bono dicitur, quod sit ipsa implantatio boni; ex significatione `exitus anni' quod sit finis operum; et ex significatione `in colligendo te opera tua ex agro quod sit fruitio et usus omnium quae 
implantata sunt bono; per `opera' enim significantur non solum ea quae agri {1} sunt sed etiam quae vineae et oliveti, ita quae fructus terrae, ut {2} patet a descriptione hujus festi {3} apud Moschen, 	Festum 
tabernaculorum facies tibi septem diebus, cum collegeris de area tua et de torculari tuo; et benedicet tibi Jehovah Deus tuus in omni proventu tuo, et in omni opere manuum tuarum, Deut. xvi 
13, 15: </p>
<p>et alibi, 	In quintodecimo die mensis septimi, cum collegeritis fructum terrae, feriabimini festum Jehovae septem dies, Lev. xxiii 39. 	[2] Quia per hoc festum significatur cultus Domini 
ex grato animo propter implantationem boni, et sic propter plenariam liberationem a damnatione, primum hic explicabitur quid sit implantatio boni: prius passim ostensum est quod homini sint binae facultates 
vitae, nempe intellectus et voluntas, et quod intellectus dicatus sit receptioni veri ac voluntas dicata receptioni boni; sunt enim bina ad quae omnia {4} in universo tam caelo quam mundo {5} 
se referunt, nempe verum et bonum {6}; inde (o)etiam patet quod bina illa faciant vitam hominis, et quod vitam ejus novam verum fidei et bonum {7} charitatis, et quod nisi utrumque implantatum fuerit 
{8} homini, non ei vita nova sit; quomodo verum quod fidei (o)inseminatur et implantatur (o)homini, notum est in Ecclesia, sed nondum bene quomodo bonum quod charitatis; homo cum infans est, recipit tunc 
{9} bonum a Domino, quod bonum est bonum innocentiae quale est infantibus; hoc bonum facit initiamentum novae voluntatis apud hominem, et crescit succedente aetate secundum vitam innocentiae cum sodalibus, 
ac secundum vitam probitatis et oboedientiae erga parentes et magistros, sed plus apud illos qui postea se regenerari patiuntur; hoc praevidet Dominus (c)et secundum statum vitae sequentis providet, 
nam Dominus in omni praesenti praevidet malum et providet bonum, et hoc a primo stamine vitae usque {10} in aeternum; postea cum homo adolescit ac incipit cogitare ex se, quantum tunc aufertur 
a jucundis amorum sui ac mundi, tantum novum illud voluntarium seu initiamentum novae voluntatis clauditur, et quantum non ab illis jucundis aufertur, tantum illud aperitur et quoque perficitur. 	[3] 
Sed quomodo id perficitur per implantationem veri, nunc dicetur: novum illud voluntarium, quod est ex bono innocentiae, est habitaculum per quod Dominus intrat apud hominem, (c)et excitat hominem ad 
velle bonum, et ex velle facere bonum; is influxus tantum operatur apud hominem quantum is desistit a malis; inde ei facultas sciendi, appercipiendi, reflectendi, ac intelligendi vera et bona moralia 
et civilia secundum jucundum usus; postea influit Dominus per bonum illud in vera doctrinae Ecclesiae quae apud hominem, et ex memoria evocat talia quae inserviunt usui vitae, et haec implantat bono 
ac perficit illud; inde est quod bonum apud hominem prorsus sit secundum usum vitae; si usus vitae pro proximo est, hoc est, pro bono concivis, patriae, Ecclesiae, caeli, ac pro Domino, tunc bonum illud 
est bonum charitatis, at si usus vitae est solum pro se et pro mundo, tunc clauditur id initiamentum novae voluntatis, ac infra illud formatur voluntarium ex malis amorum sui et mundi, ac inde intellectuale 
a falsis; hoc voluntarium est clausum supra et apertum infra, hoc est, clausum ad caelum et apertum ad mundum; ex his patet quomodo vera implantantur bono et formant illud; tum quoque quod 
homo cum in bono est, sit in caelo apud Dominum, nam, ut supra dictum est, nova voluntas, ubi bonum charitatis, est habitaculum Domini, proinde caelum apud hominem; et novum intellectuale inde est quasi 
tabernaculum per quod introitus et exitus. 	[4] Talia in communi et in particulari repraesentata sunt per hoc festum, quod festum collectionis fructuum terrae, et festum tabernaculorum dictum {11} 
est; quod ita sit, patet ex institutione hujus festi, de qua ita apud Moschen, 	In quintodecimo die mensis septimi, cum collegeritis {12} fructum terrae, feriabimini festum Jehovae septem dies; in die 
primo sabbatum, (o)et in die octavo sabbatum; et accipietis vobis in die primo fructum arboris honoris, spathas palmarum, et ramum arboris densae, et salices torrentis, et laetemini coram Jehovah Deo 
vestro septem dies; in tabernaculis habitabitis septem dies; omnis indigena Israelis habitabunt in tabernaculis; ut sciant generationes vestrae quod in tabernaculis habitare fecerim filios Israelis, 
cum eduxero eos e terra Aegypti, Lev. xxiii 39-44: </p>
<p>et alibi, 	Festum tabernaculorum facies tibi septem dies, cum collegeris de area tua et de torculari tuo; laeteris in festo illo, tu, filius tuus, 
et filia tua, et servus tuus, et ancilla tua, et Levita, et peregrinus, et orphanus, et vidua, qui in portis tuis; et omnino laetus eris, Deut. xvi 13-(x)15; </p>
<p>[5] quod status boni implantati per verum 
a Domino, ita status caeli apud hominem, per hoc festum repraesentatus sit {13}, patet a sensu interno omnium quae ibi memorantur; in eo enim sensu per diem (x)quintum decimum mensis septimi significatur 
finis status prioris, et principium status novi; (o)quod (x)quintum decimum id sit, videatur n. 8400, (o)et quoque septimum, n. 728, 6508, 8976, 9228; per fructum terrae qui tunc collectus significatur 
bonum charitatis, n. 43, 55, 913, 983, 2846, 2847, 3146, (x)7690, 7692; simile {14} et collectionem ex area et {15} torculari, frumentum enim quod (o)est areae est bonum veri, n. 5295, 5410, 
vinum quod torcularis est verum ex bono, n. 6377, et oleum quod etiam est torcularis est bonum ex quo verum {16}, n. 886, 3728, 4582, (x)4638; per sabbatum primo die et per sabbatum octavo die significatur 
conjunctio veri cum bono, et reciproce boni cum vero; quod sabbatum sit conjunctio veri et boni {17}, n. 8495, 8510, 8890, 8893, 9274; (o)quod octavus dies etiam dictus sit sabbatum, est quia per 
octavum significabatur principium novi status, n. 2044, 8400 fin.; [6] per fructum arboris honoris, quem die primo acciperent, significabatur {18} festivitas et gaudium propter bonum implantatum, (o)quapropter 
sequitur ut laetemini coram Jehovah, per spathas palmarum vera interna {19} illius boni, n. 8369, per ramum arboris densae (o)seu implexae vera boni exteriora {20} (o)seu scientifica, n. 2831, 
8133, et per salices (x)torrentis vera {21} adhuc exteriora, quae sensualium (o)corporis, per tabernacula in quibus septem dies habitarent significatur sanctum amoris a Domino {22}, et reciproce 
in Dominum, n. 414, 1102, 2145, 2152, 3312, 3391, 4391, 4599, et quod sit sanctum unionis, n. 8666; per indigenam Israelis significantur qui in bono charitatis, ita quoque abstracte bonum illud, n. 3654, 
4598, 5801, 5803, 5806, 5812, 5817, 5819, 5826, 5833, 6426, (x)7957; per laetitiam omnium tunc significabatur gaudium quale illis qui in bono {23} a Domino, ita quale illis qui in caelo, nam qui in 
bono charitatis est a Domino, is in caelo est apud Dominum; haec sunt propter quae illud festum. @1 quae messis$ @2 i quoque$ @3 i alibi$ @4 i et singula$ @5 tam mundo quam coelo$ @6 Before ad
