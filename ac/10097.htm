<h3 align="center" class="ired">属天的奥秘 第10097节</h3>
<h4 align="center"></h4><p><strong>10097</strong>.“这要从以色列人的平安祭中，作为献给耶和华的举祭”表天堂和教会里的接受，以及对它们唯独属于主的承认。这也可从前面的说明（<a href="10093.htm">10093</a>节）清楚可知。经上之所以说“从平安祭中”，是因为这些祭祀表示在自由中献上的敬拜；因为平安祭或感恩祭是甘心祭，甘心祭是一个人在自由中所给出的东西。凡出于爱，因而出于意愿所行的，可以说是“自由的”；因为凡一个人所爱的，他都会意愿。主流入此人的爱，因而流入他的意愿，并使他能接受他在自由中所接受的东西；他在自由中所接受的，也会变得自由，并为他所爱，从而成为他生命的一部分。由此明显可知，平安祭或甘心祭所表示的在自由中献上的敬拜是什么意思。由此也明显可知来自这些祭祀的举祭是什么意思，即这一事实：它们唯独来自主。“祭祀”表示总体上的一切敬拜（参看<a href="6905.htm">6905</a>，<a href="8936.htm">8936</a>，<a href="10042.htm">10042</a>节）；人的自由本质上属于他所爱之物（<a href="2870.htm">2870</a>-<a href="2893.htm">2893</a>，<a href="3158.htm">3158</a>，<a href="4031.htm">4031</a>，<a href="7439.htm">7439</a>，<a href="9096.htm">9096</a>，<a href="9585.htm">9585</a>-<a href="9591.htm">9591</a>节）。</p>

And it shall be an uplifting from among the sons of Israel of their peace sacrifices, this is an uplifting to Jehovah. That this signifies reception in the heavens and in the church, and acknowledgment 
that it is of the Lord alone, is evident also from what was shown above (n. 10093). It is said "from the peace sacrifices," because by these is signified worship which is from freedom; for the peace 
or eucharistic sacrifices were voluntary sacrifices, and those things which are voluntary are from man's freedom. That is called free which is done from love, thus which is from the will, for that which 
a man loves, he wills. The Lord flows in with man into his love, thus into his will, and causes that what a man receives he receives in freedom; and that which is received in freedom, also becomes 
free, and is loved by him, consequently it becomes of his life. Hence it is plain what is meant by worship from freedom, which is signified by the peace or voluntary sacrifices; thus also what is meant 
by the "uplifting" from them, namely, that which is of the Lord alone. (That the sacrifices signify all worship in general, see n. 6905, 8936, 10042; and that the freedom of man is that which is of 
his love, n. 2870-2893, 3158, 4031, 7439, 9096, 9585-9591.) </p>

'And it shall be a heave offering from among the children of Israel from their peace-offering sacrifices, it is a heave offering to Jehovah' means reception in the heavens and in the Church, and acknowledgement 
that they are the Lord's alone. This too is clear from what has been shown above in <a href="10093.htm">10093</a>. The words 'from peace-offering sacrifices' are used because worship offered in freedom is meant by 
those sacrifices; for peace-offering or eucharistic sacrifices were voluntary ones, and voluntary offerings are those which a person gives in freedom. That which is done out of love, and so because 
the will desires it, is said to be 'free'; for what a person loves, that he wills. The Lord flows into the person's love, thus into his will, and enables him to receive what he receives in freedom; and 
what he receives in freedom, that too becomes free. The person loves it, and consequently it becomes part of his life. From this it is evident what worship offered in freedom, meant by 'peace-offering 
sacrifices' or voluntary ones, is. It is also evident what is meant by a heave offering from those sacrifices, namely the fact that they are the Lord's alone.  </p>
<p>All worship in general is meant by 
'sacrifices', see <a href="6905.htm">6905</a>, <a href="8936.htm">8936</a>, <a href="10042.htm">10042</a>.  A person's freedom belongs essentially to what he loves, <a href="2870.htm">2870</a>-<a href="2893.htm">2893</a>, <a href="3158.htm">3158</a>, <a href="4031.htm">4031</a>, <a href="7349.htm">7349</a>, <a href="9096.htm">9096</a>, <a href="9585.htm">9585</a>-<a href="9591.htm">9591</a>.  </p>

`Et sublatio erit a cum filiis Israelis de sacrificiis pacificis illorum, sublatio illa Jehovae': quod significet receptionem in caelis et in Ecclesia, et agnitionem quod solius Domini, constat etiam 
ex illis quae supra n. 10,093 ostensa sunt. Ex `sacrificiis pacificis' dicitur quia per illa significatur cultus qui ex libero fit, sacrificia enim pacifica seu eucharistica erant sacrificia voluntaria, 
et quae voluntaria sunt, ex libero hominis sunt; liberum dicitur quod fit ex amore, ita quod ex voluntate, nam quod homo amat hoc vult; Dominus influit apud hominem in ejus amorem, ita in ejus voluntatem, 
ac facit ut quod homo recipit sit in libero, et quod {1}recipitur in libero, hoc etiam fit liberum, {2}et amat, proinde fit ejus vitae; inde patet quid cultus ex libero, qui significatur per 
`sacrificia pacifica' seu voluntaria; ita quoque quid sublatio ex illis, quod nempe sit quod solius Domini; quod `sacrificia' significent omnem cultum in genere, videatur n. 6905, 8936, 10,042, et quod 
liberum hominis sit quod est amoris (c)illius, n. 2870-2893, 3158, 4031, {3}7349, 9096, 9585-9591. @1 recipit T$ @2 et hoc quoque amat after vitae$ @3 7439$ </p>
