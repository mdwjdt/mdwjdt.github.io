<h3 align="center" class="ired">属天的奥秘 第8588节</h3>
<h4 align="center"></h4><p><strong>8588.</strong>“又叫米利巴”表抱怨的性质。这从以下事实清楚可知：在原文，“米利巴”表示争竞，或争闹，而“争闹”表示抱怨（参看<a href="8563.htm">8563</a>，<a href="8566.htm">8566</a>节）；由于名字表示某种事物的性质（<a href="8587.htm">8587</a>节），所以“米利巴”在此表示抱怨的性质。至于这次试探本身及其性质，要知道，这段经文描述了那些在试探中几乎要屈服的人，也就是说，那些抱怨天堂，也抱怨神性本身，最终几乎不信神的天命或圣治的人。前文，以及本节接下来的内容就表示这些事物，即表示试探状态的性质和试探中的抱怨的性质，其中，试探状态的性质由“玛撒”来表示，试探中的抱怨的性质由“米利巴”来表示，这一点明显可见于诗篇：<br />你在急难中呼求我，我就搭救你；我在隐密处应允你，在米利巴水那里试验你。（诗篇<a href="http://39-27.cn/诗81.7.htm">81:7</a>）<br />但就内在历史意义而言，所论述的主题是以色列民族的宗教信仰状况；这层意义描述了他们对耶和华的态度的本质，即：当他们向祂寻求帮助时，不愿为此而祈求，而是去强烈要求。原因在于，当他们看见神迹时，从心里不承认耶和华是至高神，仅仅口头上承认。他们从心里不承认祂，这一事实从他们为自己所造并敬拜的埃及牛犊很清楚地看出来，他们声称这些才是他们的神；这一事实也可从他们经常叛教清楚看出来（对此，可参看<a href="8301.htm">8301</a>节）。这些就是内在历史意义在此所描述的事；但内在属灵意义描述的是，当经历试探的人被带入释放前的最后阶段时的试探的性质。<br />以色列民族及其宗教信仰状况的品质通过他们在玛撒和米利巴与摩西争闹被描述出来，这一事实也明显可见于以下经文：<br />你们不可硬着心，像在米利巴，就是在旷野玛撒的日子，在那里，你们的祖宗试我探我，并且观看我的作为。四十年之久，我厌烦那世代，说，这是心里犯错的百姓，竟不知道我的道路！所以我在怒中起誓说，他们断不可进入我的安息！（诗篇<a href="http://39-27.cn/诗95.8.htm">95:8</a>-<a href="http://39-27.cn/诗95.11.htm">11</a>）<br />申命记：<br />你们不可试探耶和华你们的神，像你们在玛撒那样试探祂。（申命记<a href="http://39-27.cn/申6.16.htm">6:16</a>；<a href="http://39-27.cn/申9.22.htm">9:22</a>，<a href="http://39-27.cn/申9.24.htm">24</a>）<br /><br />论利未说，你的土明和乌陵都在你的圣人那里。你在玛撒曾试验祂，在米利巴水与祂争论。（申命记<a href="http://39-27.cn/申33.8.htm">33:8</a>）<br />“圣人”在此表示主，他们试探主，并且摩西和亚伦没有尊祂为圣。<br />就论述以色列民族宗教信仰状况的内在历史意义而言，摩西和亚伦并非代表神之真理，而是代表这个民族的宗教信仰状况，他们是这个民族的领袖和首领（<a href="7041.htm">7041</a>节）。由于这宗教信仰状况如前所述，所以经上向这两人声称，他们必不得领这百姓进入迦南地。这一点记录在民数记中：<br />耶和华对摩西、亚伦说，因为你们不信我，不在以色列人眼前尊我为圣，所以你们必不得领这会众进我所赐给他们的地去。这些水是米利巴水，因为以色列人与耶和华争闹。（民数记<a href="http://39-27.cn/民20.12.htm">20:12</a>，<a href="http://39-27.cn/民20.13.htm">13</a>；<a href="http://39-27.cn/民27.14.htm">27:14</a>）<br /><br />亚伦要归到他本民那里，必不得进入我所赐给以色列人的地，因为在米利巴水你们违背了我的口。（民数记<a href="http://39-27.cn/民20.24.htm">20:24</a>）<br />在申命记（<a href="http://39-27.cn/申32.50.htm">32:50</a>，<a href="http://39-27.cn/申32.51.htm">51</a>）中，经上指着摩西说了同样的话。<br />尽管如此，对神的代表性敬拜仍设立在这个民族当中，这是因为代表性敬拜可设立在任何民族当中，只要该民族具有敬拜的神圣外在，哪怕以一种近乎偶像崇拜的方式进行敬拜。事实上，代表并不关注这个人，而是关注所代表的实际事物（<a href="1361.htm">1361</a>节）；这个民族的秉性是这样，他们比其他任何民族都更将没有任何内在的纯外在事物当作神圣和神性来敬拜；例如，他们将自己的祖宗，即亚伯拉罕、以撒、雅各，后来的摩西和大卫当作神明或半神来敬拜。另外，他们还将用于敬拜神的每一块石头和木头视为神圣，认为是神性，如约柜、那里的桌子、灯台、祭坛、亚伦的法衣、乌陵和土明，以及后来的神殿。按照主的天命或圣治，那时，通过诸如此类的外在事物，天上的天使与人类建立联系成为可能。因为教会，教会的一个代表必须在某个地方存在，好叫天堂能与人类保持联系。由于这个民族比其他任何民族都更能将神性敬拜置于外在事物，因而能充当一个教会的代表，所以这个民族被采用。<br />那时，与天上天使的联系通过代表以下列方式得以实现：他们的外在敬拜被传到不反思内在事物，但内心仍旧良善的简单天使灵那里。这类灵人就是那些在大人里面对应于最外面皮肤的灵人。他们根本不关注人的内在，只关注他的外在。如果这外在看上去很神圣，他们就认为内在也是这样神圣。更内在的天上天使在这些灵人里面看见所代表的实际事物，因而看见相对应的天上和神性事物；因为他们能与这些灵人同在，并看见这些事物；但若不通过这些灵人，就不与世人同在。天使在内层事物中与世人同住；不过，当那里没有这类事物时，他们就住在简单灵人的内层事物中；因为天使只对属灵和属天事物感兴趣，这些事物就是包含在代表中的内层事物。从这个简短的解释可以看出与天堂的联系如何通过这样一个民族成为可能。关于这个主题，可参看前面的说明，即：在犹太人当中，其敬拜的神圣以一种奇迹般的方式在他们之外被提入天堂（<a href="4307.htm">4307</a>节）；雅各的后代能代表神圣之物，无论他们是何品质，只要他们严格、精准地执行所吩咐的宗教仪式（<a href="3147.htm">3147</a>，<a href="3479.htm">3479</a>，<a href="3480.htm">3480</a>，<a href="3881.htm">3881</a>e，<a href="4208.htm">4208</a>，<a href="4281.htm">4281</a>，<a href="4288.htm">4288</a>，<a href="4289.htm">4289</a>，<a href="4293.htm">4293</a>，<a href="4307.htm">4307</a>，<a href="4444.htm">4444</a>，<a href="4500.htm">4500</a>，<a href="4680.htm">4680</a>，<a href="4825.htm">4825</a>，<a href="4844.htm">4844</a>，<a href="4847.htm">4847</a>，<a href="4899.htm">4899</a>，<a href="4912.htm">4912</a>，<a href="6304.htm">6304</a>，<a href="6306.htm">6306</a>，<a href="7048.htm">7048</a>，<a href="7051.htm">7051</a>，<a href="8301.htm">8301</a>e节）。</p>

And Meribah. That this signifies the quality of the complaining, is evident from the fact that in the original tongue "Meribah" means "contention," or "quarreling," and "quarreling" signifies complaining 
(see n. 8563, 8566); and because names signify the quality of the thing (n. 8587), therefore "Meribah" here signifies the quality of the complaining. As regards this temptation itself and its quality, 
be it known that in this passage are described those who in temptations almost yield, namely, those who complain against heaven and also against the Divine Itself, and at last almost disbelieve 
in the Divine Providence. These things are signified in the internal sense by what precedes, and also by what follows in this verse, namely, the quality of the state of the temptation, which is signified 
by "Massah," and the quality of the complaining in the temptation, which is signified by "Meribah." That this quality is here signified by "Meribah," is plain in David: </p>
<p>     Thou calledst upon Me 
in distress, and I rescued thee; I answered thee in the secret place, I proved thee at the waters of Meribah (Ps. 81:7). [2] But in the internal historical sense, in which the subject treated of is 
the state of religion with the Israelitish nation, that nation is described in respect to its quality toward Jehovah, namely, that they were not willing by supplication to entreat Him for aid, but that 
they expostulated. The reason was, that at heart they did not acknowledge Jehovah as the supreme God, but only in the mouth, when they saw the miracles. That at heart they did not acknowledge Him is 
very evident from the Egyptian calf which they made for themselves and worshiped, saying that these were their gods; also from their frequent apostasy (of which see n. 8301). This is what is here described 
in the internal historical sense; but in the internal spiritual sense is described the quality of the temptation with those who before they are liberated are brought to the last of temptation. [3] 
That the quality of the Israelitish nation and of its religiosity is described by contention with Moses at Massah and Meribah, is also evident in the following passages: </p>
<p>     Harden not your heart, 
as at Meribah, as in the day of Massah in the wilderness, where your fathers tempted Me; they tempted Me, and saw My work; for forty years did I feel loathing at the generation, and said, It is a 
people that do err in their heart, and the same have not known My ways, to whom I sware in Mine anger that they should not come unto My rest (Ps. 95:8-11).      Ye shall not tempt Jehovah your God, as 
ye tempted Him in Massah (Deut. 6:16; 9:22, 24).      Of Levi he said, Thy Thummim and thy Urim are with the Holy Man, whom thou didst tempt at Massah, with whom thou didst contend at the waters of 
Meribah (Deut. 33:8). "The Holy Man" here denotes the Lord, whom they tempted, and whom Moses and Aaron did not sanctify. [4] In the internal historical sense, in which the subject treated of is the 
religiosity of the Israelitish nation, by Moses and Aaron is not represented truth Divine, but the religiosity of that nation whose leaders and heads they were (n. 7041). Because this religiosity was 
such as said above, it was intimated to them that they should not bring the people into the land of Canaan, as is written in the book of Numbers: </p>
<p>     Jehovah said unto Moses and Aaron, Because ye 
have not believed in Me, and sanctified Me in the eyes of the sons of Israel, therefore ye shall not bring this congregation into the land which I have given them; these are the waters of Meribah, because 
the sons of Israel contended with Jehovah (Num. 20:12, 13; 27:14).      Aaron shall be gathered unto his people, and shall not come into the land which I have given to the sons of Israel, because 
ye rebelled against My mouth at the waters of Meribah (Num. 20:24).      The same is said of Moses (Deut. 32:50, 51). [5] That still representative Divine worship was instituted with that nation, 
was because representative worship could be instituted with any nation that had holy externals of worship, and worshiped almost idolatrously; for what is representative does not regard the person, but 
the thing (n. 1361), and it was the genius of that nation, beyond any other nation, to worship merely external things as holy and Divine, without any internal; as for instance to worship as deities their 
fathers, Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob, and afterward Moses and David, and moreover to account holy and as Divine, and to worship, every stone and every piece of wood that had been inaugurated in their 
Divine worship; as the arks, the tables therein, the lamp, the altar, the garments of Aaron, the Urim and Thummim, and afterward the temple. Of the Lord's Providence there was then given a communication 
of the angels of heaven with man by means of such things. For there must needs be somewhere a church, or the representative of a church, in order that there may be communication of heaven with the 
human race; and as that nation, beyond any other nation, could make Divine worship consist in external things, and thus act the representative of a church, therefore that nation was taken. [6] At 
that time communication with the angels in heaven was effected by means of representatives in the following way. Their external worship was communicated to angelic spirits who are simple, and who do not 
reflect upon internal things, but still are interiorly good. Such are they who in the Grand Man correspond to the outer skin. These pay no attention whatever to the internal of man, but only to his 
external. If this appears holy, they think holily of the internal also. The more interior angels of heaven saw in those spirits the things that were represented, consequently the heavenly and Divine 
things that corresponded; for they could be present with these spirits, and see those things; but not with the men except by means of the spirits. For angels dwell with men in things interior; but where 
there are no such things, they dwell in the interior things of simple spirits; for the angels have no interest in other than spiritual and heavenly things, which are the interior things contained in 
representatives. From these few words it can be seen how there could be communication with heaven by means of such a people. But see what has been previously shown on this subject, namely: That with 
the Jews the holy of worship was miraculously elevated into heaven quite apart from them (n. 4307); that whatever their quality might be, the descendants of Jacob could represent what is holy, provided 
they closely observed the rituals commanded (n. 3147, 3479, 3480, 3881, 4208, 4281, 4288, 4289, 4293, 4307, 4444, 4500, 4680, 4825, 4844, 4847, 4899, 4912, 6304, 6306, 7048, 7051, 8301). </p>

<p align="center"><b>Elliott(1983-1999) 8588</b></p><p><b>8588.</b>
'And Meribah' means the essential nature of the complaining. This is clear from the consideration that in the original language Meribah means contention or wrangling, and 'wrangling' means complaining, <a href="8563.htm">8563</a>, <a href="8566.htm">8566</a>; and since also names mean the essential nature of something, <a href="8587.htm">8587</a>, 'Meribah' here means the essential nature of the complaining. As regards the specific temptation here and the essential 
nature of it, it should be recognized that those people are being described here who in temptations almost give in; that is to say, they complain against heaven, also against the Divine Himself, and 
at length almost cease to believe in God's providence. These things are meant in the internal sense by what has gone before and also by what follows in the present verse; they are the essential nature 
of the state of the temptation, meant by 'Massah', and the essential nature of the complaining in the temptation, meant by 'Meribah'. The fact that the latter is meant here by 'Meribah' is evident in 
David, </p>
<blockquote>
You called on Me in distress, and I rescued you; I answered you in the hiding place. I tested you by the waters of Meribah. <a href="http://bible.gospelcom.net/cgi-bin/bible?passage=Ps%2081:7&amp;version=ESV&amp;interface=print&amp;showfn=yes&amp;showxref">Ps 81:7</a>. 
</blockquote>
<p></p>
<p><b>[2]</b>
 But the internal historical sense, in which the 
religious condition of the Israelite nation is the subject, describes the nature of their attitude towards Jehovah. It was such that when they asked Him for aid they refused to plead for it, and instead 
demanded it. The reason for this was that when they saw miracles their acknowledgement of Jehovah as the Supreme Deity did not exist in their heart, only on their lips. The fact that there was no 
acknowledgement of Him in their heart is perfectly clear from the Egyptian calf which they made for themselves and worshipped, saying that these were their gods, and also from their frequent apostasy, 
regarding which see <a href="8301.htm">8301</a>. These are the matters that the internal historical sense describes here; but the internal spiritual sense describes the essential nature of the temptation when those undergoing 
it are brought to the final phase before their deliverance. </p>
<p></p>
<p><b>[3]</b>
 The fact that the character of the Israelite nation and their religious condition are described by their contending with Moses at 
Massah and Meribah is also clear in David, </p>
<blockquote>
Do not harden your heart as in Meribah, as in the day of Massah, in the wilderness, where your fathers tempted Me; they tempted Me, and saw My work. For 
forty years I loathed [that] generation, and said, They are a people who err in their heart and have not known My ways, to whom I swore in My anger, They shall not enter My rest. <a href="http://bible.gospelcom.net/cgi-bin/bible?passage=Ps%2095:8-11&amp;version=ESV&amp;interface=print&amp;showfn=yes&amp;showxref">Ps 95:8-11</a>. 
</blockquote>
<p>In Moses, </p>
<blockquote>
You 
shall not tempt Jehovah your God, as you tempted [Him] in Massah. <a href="http://bible.gospelcom.net/cgi-bin/bible?passage=Deut%206:16&amp;version=ESV&amp;interface=print&amp;showfn=yes&amp;showxref">Deut 6:16</a>. 
</blockquote>
<p>In the same author, </p>
<blockquote>
Furthermore in Taberah and in Massah and in Kibroth Hattaavah, you were rebels against 
Jehovah from the day I knew you. <a href="http://bible.gospelcom.net/cgi-bin/bible?passage=Deut%209:22,%2024&amp;version=ESV&amp;interface=print&amp;showfn=yes&amp;showxref">Deut 9:22, 24</a>. 
</blockquote>
<p>In the same author, </p>
<blockquote>
Of Levi he said, Your Thummim and your Urim shall be for the Holy Man (Vir) whom you tempted in Massah; you contended with 
Him at the waters of Meribah. <a href="http://bible.gospelcom.net/cgi-bin/bible?passage=Deut%2033:8,%209&amp;version=ESV&amp;interface=print&amp;showfn=yes&amp;showxref">Deut 33:8, 9</a> 
</blockquote>
<p>'The Holy Man' here stands for the Lord, whom they tempted, and whom Moses and Aaron 'did not honour as holy'. </p>
<p></p>
<p><b>[4]</b>
 In the internal historical sense, 
in which the religious condition of the Israelite nation is the subject, Moses and Aaron do not represent God's truth, but the religious condition of that nation, whose leaders and heads they were, 
<a href="7041.htm">7041</a>. Since that religious condition was such as has been mentioned above, it was declared to the two that they would not lead the people into the land of Canaan. This is stated in the Book of Numbers 
as follows, </p>
<blockquote>
Jehovah said to Moses and Aaron, Because you did not believe in Me and honour Me as holy in the eyes of the children of Israel, therefore you will not bring this congregation into the 
land which I have given them. These are the waters of Meribah, because the children of Israel contended with Jehovah. <a href="http://bible.gospelcom.net/cgi-bin/bible?passage=Num%2020:12,%2013;%2027:14&amp;version=ESV&amp;interface=print&amp;showfn=yes&amp;showxref">Num 20:12, 13; 27:14</a>. 
</blockquote>
<p>And in the same book, </p>
<blockquote>
Aaron will be gathered to his 
people, and will not enter the land which I have given to the children of Israel, because you rebelled against My word<A name="fntext1"></a><A href="#fn1"><sup>a</sup></a> at the waters of Meribah. <a href="http://bible.gospelcom.net/cgi-bin/bible?passage=Num%2020:24&amp;version=ESV&amp;interface=print&amp;showfn=yes&amp;showxref">Num 20:24</a>.

<p><b>[5]</b>
Among that nation representative worship of God was nevertheless established because representative worship could have been established among any nation that thought the outward things of 
worship were holy and venerated them in a virtually idolatrous manner. For a representative has no regard to the person who represents, only to the reality represented, <a href="1361.htm">1361</a>; and that nation was by disposition 
such, more than any other nation, that outward things devoid of anything internal were altogether venerated by them as being holy and Divine. They were such that they revered their fathers 
- Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob, and later on Moses and David - as demi-gods. In addition they venerated as being holy and Divine, and worshipped, every piece of stone or wood dedicated to their worship of 
God, such as the Ark, the tables there, the lampstand, the altar, Aaron's vestments, the Urim and Thummim, and later on the temple. By means of outward things such as these at that time communication 
of the angels of heaven with mankind was in the Lord's providence made possible; for the Church, or a representative of the Church, must exist somewhere, in order that heaven may be in communication 
with the human race. And since that nation more than any other could make Divine worship consist in outward things, and so could act as a representative of the Church, that nation was the one to be adopted. </p>
<p></p>
<p><b>[6]</b>
The communication with angels in heaven by means of representatives was effected at that time in the following way. People's outward worship was conveyed to angelic spirits who are simple 
and give no thought to inward values, though they are themselves nevertheless good inwardly. Such spirits are those who in the Grand Man correspond to the skin. They pay no attention at all to what 
is in a person inwardly, only to what is visible outwardly; and if this is seen by them to be holy they think that what is inward is so too. The more internal angels of heaven saw in these spirits the 
realities that were being represented, consequently the corresponding heavenly and Divine values; for they could reside with these spirits and see those values, but not with men, except through those 
spirits. Angels dwell with men in their inward values; but when no inward values are there, they dwell in the interiors of simple spirits; for the wisdom of angels extends only to spiritual and celestial 
values, which are the inward realities of representatives From this brief explanation one may recognize how communication with heaven through such a people could be made possible. But see what has 
been shown already on this matter: </p>
<p> Among the Jews the holiness of their worship was carried up outside themselves into heaven in a miraculous fashion, <a href="4307.htm">4307</a>. The descendants of Jacob were able to 
represent what was holy, irrespective of what they were really like, provided that the religious observances which had been commanded were carried out precisely, <a href="3147.htm">3147</a>, <a href="3479.htm">3479</a>, <a href="3480.htm">3480</a>, <a href="3881.htm">3881</a> (end), <a href="4208.htm">4208</a>, <a href="4281.htm">4281</a>,

dixeruntque quod illi sint {10}dii sui; tum a frequenti illorum apostasia, de qua videatur n. 8301; haec sunt quae in sensu interno historico hic describuntur; in sensu autem interno spirituali describitur 
quale tentationis apud illos qui ad ultimum {11}tentationis perducuntur antequam liberantur. 	3 Quod quale gentis Israeliticae (c)ac religiosi ejus describatur per {12}contentionem cum Mosche ad 
Massah et Meribah, constat etiam apud Davidem, Ne obturate cor vestrum sicut in Meribah, sicut in die Massae, in deserto, ubi tentarunt Me patres vestri; tentarunt Me, et viderunt opus Meum; quadraginta 
annis fastidivi in generatione, et dixi, Populus sunt errantes corde, iidemque non cognoverunt vias Meas, quibus juravi in ira Mea, si venient ad requiem Meam, Ps. xcv 8-11: </p>
<p>apud Moschen, Non 
tentabitis Jehovam Deum vestrum, quemadmodum tentastis in Massah, Deut. vi 16: </p>
<p>apud eundem, Praeterea in Tabera et in Massah et in Kibroth Thaavah rebelles fuistis cum Jehovah a die quo cognovi vos, 
Deut. ix 22, 24: </p>
<p>apud eundem, De Levi dixit, Thumim tui et Urim tui Viro Sancto, quem tentasti in Massah, contendisti cum Eo apud aquas Meribah, Deut. xxxiii [8,] 9; </p>
<p>`Vir Sanctus' hic pro Domino, 
Quem tentaverunt, et Quem non sanctificaverunt Moscheh et Aharon; in sensu interno historico, in quo de religioso (x)gentis Israeliticae agitur, per Moschen et Aharonem non repraesentatur {13}verum Divinum, 
sed religiosum istius gentis, cujus duces et capita erant, n. 7041; hoc religiosum quia tale fuit, ut supra dictum, etiam ideo illis denuntiatum est quod non introducerent populum in terram Canaanem, 
de qua re ita in Libro Numerorum, Dixit Jehovah ad Moschen et Aharonem, Propterea quod non credidistis in Me, et sanctificavistis Me in oculis filiorum Israelis, ideo non deducetis congregationem 
hanc in terram {14} quam dedi illis; hae aquae Meribah, quia contenderunt filii Israelis cum Jehovah, xx 12, 13, xxvii 14: </p>
<p>et in eodem Libro, Colligetur Aharon ad populum suum, et non veniet in 
terram quam dedi filiis Israelis, propterea quod rebellastis ori Meo apud aquas Meribah, xx 24: </p>
<p>pariter Moscheh, Deut. xxxii [49-] 51. 	5 Quod apud illam gentem usque cultus Divinus repraesentativus 
institutus fuerit, erat causa quia repraesentativus cultus potuit institui apud omnem gentem quae externa cultus sancta haberet, et paene idololatrice coleret, nam repraesentativum non spectat personam 
sed rem, n. 1361, et genius illius gentis prae omni alia gente fuit, prorsus (t)colere externa ut sancta et Divina absque omni interno, sicut adorare patres suos, Abrahamum, Jischakum, et Jacobum, 
ac postea Moschen et Davidem, ut numina, ac praeterea sanctum et ut Divinum habere et colere omnem lapidem et omne lignum, quod {15}cultui illorum Divino inauguratum fuit, sicut {16}arcam, mensas ibi, 
{17}lampadem, altare, vestes Aharonis, Urim et Thumim, et postea templum; per {18}talia dabatur eo tempore ex providentia Domini {19} communicatio angelorum caeli cum homine, nam oportet alicubi Ecclesia 
esse, seu repraesentativum Ecclesiae, ut sit communicatio caeli cum humano genere; et quia illa gens prae omni alia gente potuit in externis ponere cultum Divinum, et sic agere repraesentativam Ecclesiae, 
ideo gens illa {20}assumpta est. 	6 Communicatio cum angelis in caelo per repraesentativa fiebat eo tempore hoc modo: cultus (c)illorum externus communicabatur cum spiritibus angelicis qui 
simplices sunt et non ad interna (x)reflectunt, sed usque interius boni sunt; tales sunt qui in Maximo Homine correspondent cuticulis; hi prorsus non attendunt ad internum hominis sed solum ad externum 
ejus; si hoc {21}sanctum apparet, etiam illi sancte de illo cogitant; angeli interiores caeli {22}in his spiritibus videbant illa quae repraesentabantur, proinde caelestia et Divina quae correspondebant, 
nam apud hos potuerunt esse, et videre illa, non autem apud homines, nisi per illos; habitant enim angeli cum hominibus in interioribus, at ubi non interiora sunt, habitant in interioribus spirituum 
simplicium, nam angeli non sapiunt nisi spiritualia et caelestia quae interiora sunt in repraesentativis; ex his paucis constare potest quomodo {23}dari potuerit communicatio cum caelo per talem 
populum; sed videantur quae de hac re prius ostensa sunt, nempe quod apud Judaeos sanctum cultus miraculose elevatum fuerit in caelum extra illos, n. 4307; quod {24}posteri Jacobi sanctum potuerint repraesentare, 
qualescumque fuerunt, modo ritualia mandata stricte observarent, n. 3147, 3479, 3480, 3881 fin., (x)4208, 4281, 4288, 4289, 4293, 4307, 4444, 4500, 4680, 4825, 4844, 4847, 4899, 4912, 6304,
