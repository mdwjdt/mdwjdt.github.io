<h3 align="center" class="ired">属天的奥秘 第2880节</h3>
<h4 align="center"></h4><p><strong>2880.</strong>在人看来，除了自由所流出的东西外，没有什么东西是他的，或是他自己的。原因在于，存在于爱里面的一切情感构成他的内在生命本身；出于情感行事就是出于其生命，即出于他自己，因而出于他的东西，也就是他自己的东西行事。因此，为叫人能接受诸如天上的天使所拥有的那种天堂自我，他被保守在自由中，并通过自由以前面早已描述过的方式被引入天堂自我。谁都能看出，出于自由敬拜主看似出于人自己，也就是出于人自己的东西来敬拜；而强制敬拜并非出于人自己，而是出于迫使他这样做的外力或某个其它源头。因此，自由敬拜是敬拜本身，强制敬拜则根本不是敬拜。</p>

<p align="center"><b>Potts(1905-1910) 2880</b></p><p><b>2880.</b>
Nothing else appears to a man as his (or what is the same, as his own) except that which flows from freedom. The reason is that all affection which is of love is his veriest life; and to act from affection 
is to act from life, that is, from himself, and thus from what is his, or what is the same, from his own. In order therefore that man may receive an Own that is heavenly, such as have the angels 
in heaven, he is kept in freedom, and through freedom he is introduced into it, in the way already stated. It may be known to everyone that to worship the Lord from freedom appears as if it were from 
one's self, or from one's own; but that to worship Him under compulsion is not from one's self, but from a force from without, or from some other source, compelling him to do it; thus that worship from 
freedom is worship itself, and that worship under compulsion is no worship. </p>

<p align="center"><b>Elliott(1983-1999) 2880</b></p><p><b>2880.</b>
Nothing else seems to a person to be that person's, that is, to be properly his own, except that which flows from freedom. The reason is that all affection that exists within love constitutes his inner 
life itself; and when someone acts from affection he does so from his life, that is, from himself and so from what is his, that is, properly his own. In order therefore that a person may receive a 
heavenly proprium such as angels in heaven have, he is maintained in freedom, and by means of the freedom is introduced into it in the way described already. Anyone may see that when worshipping the Lord 
in freedom one seems to do so from oneself, that is, from what is properly one's own, but when worshipping under compulsion one is not doing so from oneself but from some outside influence or from 
some other source that forces one to do it. Thus anyone may see that worship offered in freedom is worship itself, but worship offered under compulsion is not worship at all. </p>

</p><b>2880.</b>
Nihil aliud apparet homini ut suum, seu quod idem, ut ejus proprium, quam quod fluit ex libero; causa est quia omnis affectio quae es amoris, est ipsissima ejus vita, et ex affectione agere est ex vita, 
hoc est, ex semet, ita a suo, seu quod idem, ex proprio:  ut itaque homo proprium caeleste accipiat quale proprium est angelis in caelo, tenetur homo in libero, et per liberum ita, sicut dictum, 
introducitur.  Notum cuivis esse potest quod colere Dominum ex libero, appareat ut a se, seu ex proprio; at colere ex coacto quod sit non a se, sed a vi extrinsecus aut aliunde ad id faciendum adigente; 
ita quod cultus ex libero sit ipse cultus et quod cultus ex coacto sit nullus cultus. </p>
