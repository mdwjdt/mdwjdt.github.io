<h3 align="center" class="ired">属天的奥秘 第2057节</h3>
<h4 align="center"></h4><p><strong>2057.</strong> “就是没有割去肉体包皮的”表我欲（即对自我之爱）居于主导的人。这从前面有关“受割礼”、“包皮”（<a href="2039.htm">2039</a>，<a href="2049.htm">2049</a>节末尾），以及“肉体”（<a href="2041.htm">2041</a>节）含义的论述清楚可知。此处“肉体包皮”表我欲（即对自我之爱）。教会中那些受制于虚假，同时受制于我欲的人主要是那些亵渎神圣事物的人。而被其它任意一种爱所主导的人则没有那么糟糕，因为我欲是最污秽的，它对社会，因而对人类具有毁灭性，如前所示（<a href="2045.htm">2045</a>节）。它还与构成天堂的相爱截然对立，因而对天堂秩序本身也具有毁灭性。这从来世的恶灵和魔鬼，以及地狱可以看出来，地狱无非是我欲占主导的地方。由于我欲在那里居于主导地位，故各种仇恨、报复和残忍也居于主导地位，因为这些是我欲的产物。<br />在天堂，相爱在于那些爱邻胜己的人。其结果是，整个天堂可以说呈现为一个人，因为所有人凭相爱被主联结起来。正因如此，所有人的幸福会传给每个人，每个人的幸福则传给所有人。所以，天堂的形式具有这样的性质：每个人可以说都是一个中心点，因而是全体的交流和快乐的中心点。并且，这一切会照着相爱的各种形式进行，而这些形式不计其数。由于那些由相爱所主导的人察觉到无上的快乐就是能与他人交流所流入他们里面的事物，并发自内心这样做，故这种交流变得持久、永恒。因此缘故，随着主国度的增加，每位天使的快乐也相应增长。由于天使住在不同的社群和居所，故他们没有想过这个问题。但主就是这样照秩序安排每一个事物，这就是主在天上的国度。<br />再没有比我欲更努力地摧毁这种形式和这种秩序的了。因此，在来世，凡被我欲主导的人所处的地狱比其他人更深。因为我欲不与他人交流任何事物，反而将他们的快乐和幸福全都扼杀和窒息。无论什么样的快乐，只要从别人那里流入他们里面，他们就会据为己有，将其集中在自己里面，并转变为他们自己的某种秽物，防止它进一步传播，从而摧毁所有趋向和谐一致之物，分离和随之的毁灭由此而来。他们当中的每一个都渴望得到他人的服侍、取悦和崇拜，并且除了自己外不爱任何人，故后果就是分离，这后果指向并表现为悲惨的状态。因此，他们觉得再没有比出于仇恨、报复、残忍，通过可怕的方法和幻觉折磨他人更快乐的了。当这种人来到相爱所在的社群时，他们会自动栽倒在地，就象干净清新空气中不洁和失去生命的重物，因为所流入的一切快乐都在他们自己里面终止。他们散发出自我的污秽观念，所以他们的快乐在那里转化为尸体的恶臭。他们通过这种臭味闻到自我的地狱，感到痛苦万分。<br />由此可见，这就是我欲的性质，它不仅对人类具有毁灭性（如前所示，<a href="2045.htm">2045</a>节），而且对天堂秩序也具有毁灭性。因此，它里面只有肮脏、污秽、亵渎和地狱本身，尽管这一切在身处其中之人看来并非如此。那些被我欲主导的人就是诸如与自己相比鄙视其他人的人。他们憎恨那些不支持、服侍，并以某种方式敬拜他们的人。而且，他们在报复、剥夺他人荣耀、名声、财富、生命中寻求残忍的快乐。他们的快乐因被我欲主导而变得如此。那些具有这种快乐的人能认识到他们被我欲主导。</p>

Who is not circumcised in the flesh of his foreskin. That this signifies who is in the love of self, is evident from what was said above in regard to the signification of being "circumcised," and of 
the "foreskin" (n. 2039, 2049, at the end), also as to the signification of "flesh" (n. 2041). The "flesh of the foreskin" here signifies the love of self. Those within the church who are in falsity, 
and at the same time are in the love of self, are most especially those who profane holy things; but they who are in any other love whatever not so much, for the love of self is the most foul of all, 
because it is destructive of society, and thus of the human race, as before shown (n. 2045). That it is also diametrically opposed to mutual love, in which heaven consists, and thus is destructive of 
heavenly order itself, may be seen from the evil spirits and genii in the other life; and also from the hells, in which nothing reigns but the love of self; and because the love of self reigns there, 
so do all kinds of hatreds, revenges, and cruelties, because these are derived from it.  [2] Mutual love in heaven consists in the fact that they love the neighbor more than themselves, the effect of 
which is that the whole heaven represents as it were one man; for by means of mutual love all are so consociated by the Lord, and hence it is that the happinesses of all are communicated to each one, 
and those of each one to all. Consequently the heavenly form is such that everyone is as it were a kind of center, thus a center of communications, and consequently of happinesses, from all; and this 
in accordance with all the differences of mutual love, which are innumerable. And because those who are in that love perceive the highest happiness in being able to communicate to others that which flows 
into them, and this from the heart, the communication becomes perpetual and eternal; and on this account, as the Lord's kingdom increases, so the happiness of each angel increases. As the angels 
are in distinct societies and abodes, they do not think of this; but the Lord thus disposes all things both in general and in particular. Such is the kingdom of the Lord in the heavens.  [3] Nothing 
else endeavors to destroy this form and this order than the love of self, and therefore all in the other life who are in the love of self are more deeply infernal than others, for the love of self communicates 
nothing to others, but extinguishes and suffocates their delights and happinesses. Whatever delight flows into them from others, they receive to themselves, concentrate it within themselves, 
turn it into the filthiness of self, prevent its going any further, and thus destroy all that tends to unanimity and consociation. From this comes disunion, and consequently destruction. And as every 
such person desires to be served, courted, and adored by others, and loves no one but himself, hence comes dissociation, which is determined and puts itself forth into lamentable states, so that they 
perceive nothing to be more delightful than to torture others, in direful modes and by phantasies, from hatred, revenge, and cruelty. When such persons come to any society where mutual love resides, 
they are cast down of their own accord, like impure and dead weights in a pure and living aura, because all the influent delight is terminated in themselves; and because they exhale a foul idea of self, 
their delight is there turned into a cadaverous stench, by which they are made sensible of the hell of self, besides being seized with terrible anguish.  [4] From this we can see that it is the nature 
of the love of self to be destructive not only of the human race (as shown above, n. 2045), but also of heavenly order; and thus that there is nothing in it but impurity, filthiness, profaneness, 
and hell itself; however little this may appear to those who are in it. They are in the love of self who despise others in comparison with themselves, and hate those who do not favor, serve, and pay 
a kind of worship to them; and who find a cruel delight in revenge, and in depriving others of honor, reputation, wealth, and life. They who are in the love of self are in these evils; and they who are 
in these evils may know that they are in the love of self.  </p>

<p align="center"><b>Elliott(1983-1999) 2057</b></p><p><b>2057.</b>
'Who is not circumcised in the flesh of his foreskin' means one in whom self-love reigns. This is clear from what has been stated above about the meaning of 'being circumcised' and of 'the foreskin', <a href="2039.htm">2039</a>, <a href="2049.htm">2049</a> (end), and also about the meaning of 'the flesh', <a href="2041.htm">2041</a>. Here 'the flesh of the foreskin' means self-love. Those inside the Church who are subject to falsity and at the same time to self-love 
are the main ones to profane holy things, more so than those in whom some other love reigns, for self- love is the filthiest of all since it is destructive of society and so of the human race, as shown 
above in <a href="2045.htm">2045</a>. That it is also diametrically opposed to mutual love which constitutes heaven, and so is destructive of heavenly order itself, becomes clear from evil spirits and genii in the next 
life, and also from the hells where nothing but self-love reigns. And because self-love reigns there, so do all types of hatred, revenge, and cruelty, since these are the product of self-love. </p>
<p></p>
<p><b>[2]</b>
Mutual love in heaven consists in those there loving their neighbour more than themselves, and as a result the whole of heaven represents so to speak one human being; for by means of mutual love from 
the Lord all are associated together in that way. Consequently every manifestation of happiness possessed by all is communicated to each individual, and that possessed by each individual to all. The 
heavenly form produced by this is such that everyone is so to speak a kind of centre point, thus the centre point of communications and therefore of manifestations of happiness from all. And this takes 
place in accordance with all the variant forms of that love, which are countless. And because those in whom that love reigns experience supreme happiness in being able to communicate to others that 
which flows into them, and to do so from the heart, the communication consequently becomes perpetual and eternal. And as the Lord's kingdom increases from the communication so does the happiness of each 
individual. Because angels are distinguished into separate communities and habitations they give no thought to this matter; it is the Lord who so arranges in order every single thing. Such is the Lord's 
kingdom in the heavens. </p>
<p></p>
<p><b>[3]</b>
 Nothing else apart from self-love endeavours to destroy this form and this order. For this reason all in the next life in whom self-love reigns are more thoroughly 
hellish than others; for self-love does not communicate anything to others, but stifles and smothers all their delight and happiness. Whatever delight flows into them from others, they take to themselves, 
focus on themselves, and transform into some filthy thing of their own, and prevent it spreading any further. In so doing they destroy all unanimity and concord, and so bring about disunity and 
consequently destruction. And since each one of them wishes to be served, respected, and adored by others, and loves none but himself, division is the outcome which is directed towards and manifests itself 
in wretched states. As a result they never feel happier than when, out of hatred, revenge, and cruelty, they are tormenting others by shocking methods and delusions. When such as these come to any 
community where mutual love reigns, then because every inflowing delight is terminated in themselves, they fall to the ground of their own accord, like unclean and dead, weighty objects in clean and 
fresh air. And because they exude the foul idea of self, the delight they have is converted there into the stench of a corpse from which they scent the hell of selfishness, in addition to being seized 
with severe pain. </p>
<p></p>
<p><b>[4]</b>
 This makes clear the nature of self-love - not only is it destructive of the human race, as shown above in <a href="2045.htm">2045</a>, but it is also destructive of heavenly order. It accordingly 
contains nothing but impurity, filth, profanity, and hell itself, though this does not appear so to those who are under its influence. Those in whom self-love reigns are such as despise others in comparison 
with themselves; they hate whoever shows them no favour, fails to serve them, and does not in a way worship them; and they take a cruel delight in revenge and in depriving others of position, 
reputation, wealth, and life. Being governed by self-love their delights are such; so let those whose delights are such recognize that they are governed by self-love. </p>

`Qui non circumciditur carne praeputii sui': quod significet qui in amore sui, constat ex illis quae supra de significatione `circumcidi (o)et praeputii' n. 2039, 2049 fin., tum de significatione `carnis' 
n. 2041, dicta sunt; `caro praeputii' hic significat amorem sui; qui intra Ecclesiam in falso sunt et simul in amore sui, ii imprimis sancta profanant, non ita illi qui in alio quocumque amore 
(o)sunt, nam amor sui est omnium spurcissimus, quia destructivus societatis ita destructivus generis humani est, ut supra n. 2045 ostensum; quod etiam e diametro oppositus sit amori mutuo in quo caelum 
consistit, ita destructivus ipsius ordinis caelestis, constare potest a malis spiritibus et geniis in altera vita, tum ab infernis in quibus nihil est nisi amor sui qui regnat, et quia amor sui, etiam 
omnia odiorum, vindictarum et crudelitatum genera, quia haec sunt inde.  [2] Amor mutuus in caelo consistit in eo ut proximum (t)ament plus quam se, inde totum caelum repraesentat sicut unum hominem, 
nam per mutuum amorem a Domino ita consociantur omnes; inde est quod omnium felicitates communicentur singulis et singulorum omnibus; ipsa forma caelestis inde talis est quod quisque quasi sit quoddam 
centrum, ita centrum communicationum proinde felicitatum ab omnibus, et hoc secundum omnes differentias amoris illius quae innumerabiles; et quia illi qui in amore illo sunt, summam felicitatem percipiunt 
ex eo quod communicare possint illud quod ad eos influit cum aliis, et hoc ex corde, inde perpetua et aeterna fit communicatio, ex qua quantum Domini regnum, tantum singulorum felicitas crescit; 
(m)angeli quia in societates et mansiones distincti sunt, de eo non cogitant, sed Dominus ita {1} omnia et singula disponit(n); tale est regnum Domini in caelis.  [3] Sed hanc formam et hunc ordinem 
nihil aliud destruere conatur quam amor sui, ita omnes illi in altera vita qui {2} in amore sui sunt, profundius infernales prae aliis; {3} amor enim sui nihil communicat aliis, sed aliorum jucunda 
et felicia exstinguit et suffocat; quodcumque jucundum ad illos influens ab aliis, ad se recipiunt, in se concentrant, vertunt in spurcum sui, et faciunt ut non ulterius propagetur, ita destruunt omne 
unanimum et consociabile; inde disunio, et consequenter destructio; et quia unusquisque eorum ab aliis serviri, coli et adorari vult, et nullum amat quam semet, inde dissociatio quae determinatur et 
se exserit in lamentabiles status, ut nihil jucundius percipiant quam ex odio, vindicta et crudelitate alios diris modis et phantasiis cruciare; tales cum ad societatem quandam veniunt ubi amor mutuus, 
quia omne influens jucundum in illis terminatur, sicut impura et mortua pondera in pura et viva aura a semet dejiciuntur, et quia sui spurcam ideam exhalant, ibi vertitur jucundum eorum in fetorem 
cadaverosum, ex quo sui infernum sentiunt, praeter quod angore atroci corripiantur: [4] exinde constare potest qualis amor sui est, nempe quod non solum destructivus generis humani, ut supra n. 2045 ostensum, 
sed etiam quod sit destructivus ordinis caelestis, ac ita in illo nihil nisi impurum, spurcum, profanum, ac ipsum infernum; utcumque non talis apparet illis qui in eo sunt.  Illi in amore sui 
sunt qui contemnunt alios prae se, et illos qui sibi non favent, serviunt et quendam cultum praebent, odio habent, et crudele jucundum capiunt in vindicta, et in aliorum honoris, famae, opum, et vitae 
deprivatione; qui in illo sunt, in his sunt, et qui in his, sciant quod in illo sint. 	@1 sic.$ 	@2 qui in altera vita.$ 	@3 In A the rest of this paragraph is much altered and then deleted, with 
direction to a separate sheet which is, however, missing.  Continuation in I has some resemblances to deleted passage.$ </p>
