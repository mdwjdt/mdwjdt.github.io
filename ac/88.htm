<h3 align="center" class="ired">属天的奥秘 第88节</h3>
<h4 align="center"></h4><p><strong>88.</strong>当属灵之人成了属天之人，就被称为“神的工”。因为主为他作战，已经创造、作成了他，故经上说：“神在第七日歇了他一切的工”，又说：“神歇了他一切创造的工。”<br />先知书常将人称为“耶和华手的工作”，例如：“耶和华以色列的圣者，就是造就以色列的，如此说，将来的事你们可以问我，至于我的众子，并我手的工作，你们可以吩咐我。我造地，又造人在地上，我亲手铺张诸天，天上万象也是我所命定的。创造诸天的耶和华，制造成全大地的神，他创造坚定大地，并非使地荒凉，是要给人居住。他如此说，我是耶和华，再没有别神。”（以赛亚书<a href="http://39-27.cn/赛45.11.htm">45:11</a>-<a href="http://39-27.cn/赛45.12.htm">12</a>，<a href="http://39-27.cn/赛45.18.htm">18</a>，<a href="http://39-27.cn/赛45.21.htm">21</a>）这话论及重生之人。<br />由此可见，新造，亦即重生，完全是主的作为。在上述经文中，“创造”、“造就”、“造”是有分别的，在其它各处也是如此，例如：“凡称我名下的人，是我为自己的荣耀创造的，是我作成，所造作的。”（以赛亚书<a href="http://39-27.cn/赛43.7.htm">43:7</a>）前一章和本章的用词，也不例外，例如：“神歇了他一切创造的工，就安息了。”在内义上，不同的用词通常传达不同的含义。主被称为“创造者”、“造就者”、“造作者”，情况是一样的。</p>

<p><strong>[NCE]88.</strong> Spiritual people are called God's work after they have developed a heavenly nature, because the Lord has fought for them all on his own. He is the one who has made, formed, and created them. That is why this verse says that God completed his work on the seventh day and, twice, that he rested from all his work. The prophets frequently call such people the work of Jehovah's hands or fingers. An example describing the regenerate person occurs in Isaiah:<br />This is what Jehovah, the Holy One of Israel and its fashioner, has said: "Do you seek signs from me concerning my children, and command me concerning the work of my hands? I made the earth, and the human being on it I myself created! My hands stretched out the heavens, and to their whole army I gave commands!" Because this is what Jehovah has said in creating the heavens (he is God, forming the earth and making it; he is firming it; he has not created it a void; he has formed it to be inhabited): "I am Jehovah, and no one is God except me." (<a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_88/bible_king-james-version_isaiah_45_11-12" target=_top>Isaiah 45:11-12</a>, <a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_88/bible_king-james-version_isaiah_45_18" target=_top>18</a>, <a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_88/bible_king-james-version_isaiah_45_21" target=_top>21</a>)<br />This passage shows how creating people anew — regenerating them — is the Lord's work alone.<br />The words create, form (or fashion), and make (or do) are used in fairly different ways, as in the preceding quotation from Isaiah, which says "creating the heavens, forming the earth, and making it."{*1} Likewise in another passage:<br />All have been called by my name, and I have created them for my glory; I have formed them; yes, I have made them. (<a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_88/bible_king-james-version_isaiah_43_7" target=_top>Isaiah 43:7</a>)<br />The same is true in <a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_88/bible_king-james-version_genesis_1_1-31" target=_top>Genesis 1</a> and 2, as for instance here, where it says, "He rested from all the work that he had done as God in creating it." The inner meaning maintains a distinct idea for each of these words. Similarly in places where the Lord is called Creator, or Fashioner, or Maker.{*2} <br /><strong>Footnotes:</strong><br />{*1} For the three Hebrew words for creation that are referred to here, see note 2 in <a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_88/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_16" target=_top>16</a>.

When the spiritual man becomes celestial, he is called the "work of God" because the Lord alone has fought for him, and has created, formed, and made him; and therefore it is here said, "God finished 
His work on the seventh day;" and twice, that "He rested from all His work." By the Prophets man is repeatedly called the "work of the hands and of the fingers of Jehovah;" as in Isaiah, speaking of 
the regenerate man: </p>
<p>     Thus hath said Jehovah the Holy One of Israel, and his Former, Seek ye signs of Me, signs concerning My sons, and concerning the work of My hands command ye Me. I have made the 
earth, and created man upon it; I, even My hands have stretched out the heavens, and all their army have I commanded. For thus hath said Jehovah that createth the heavens, God Himself that formeth 
the earth and maketh it; He establisheth it, He created it not a void, He formed it to be inhabited; I am Jehovah and there is no God else besides Me (Isa. 45:11-12, 18, 21). Hence it is evident that 
the new creation, or regeneration, is the work of the Lord alone. The expressions to "create" to "form" and to "make" are employed quite distinctively, both in the above passage-"creating the heavens, 
forming the earth, and making it"-and in other places in the same Prophet, as: </p>
<p>     Everyone that is called by My name, I have created him for My glory, I have formed him, yea, I have made him (Isa. 
43:7), and also in both the preceding and this chapter of Genesis; as in the passage before us: "He rested from all His work which God in making created." In the internal sense this usage always conveys 
a distinct idea; and the case is the same where the Lord is called "Creator" "Former" or "Maker." </p>

<p align="center"><b>Elliott(1983-1999) 88</b></p><p><b>88.</b>
When the spiritual man becomes celestial he is called 'God's work', because the Lord alone fought on his behalf and created, formed, and made him. This is why it is said here that 'God finished His work 
on the seventh day', and why it is twice said that 'He rested from all His work'. Time and again in the Prophets man is called 'the work of Jehovah's hands and fingers', as in Isaiah, when someone 
who is regenerate is the subject,   Thus said Jehovah, the Holy One of Israel, and He who formed him, Seek signs from Me concerning My sons, and over the work of My hands command Me. I made the earth, 
and created man upon it; it was I, My hands stretched out the heavens, and I commanded all their host. For thus said Jehovah who created the heavens and who is God,who formed the earth and made it: 
He who established it did not create it an emptiness; He formed it to be inhabited. It was I Jehovah, and no god else besides Me. <a href="http://bible.gospelcom.net/cgi-bin/bible?passage=Isa%2045:11,%2012,%2018,%2021&amp;version=ESV&amp;interface=print&amp;showfn=yes&amp;showxref">Isa 45:11, 12, 18, 21</a>.  </p>
<p>It is clear from these verses that the new 
creation, or regeneration, is the work of the Lord alone. Each of the verbs, create, form, and make, is quite different in its usage, as in these verses from Isaiah where it is said that 'He created 
the heavens, formed the earth and made it'. Also elsewhere in Isaiah, </p>
<blockquote>
Every one who is called by My name, I have created him for My glory, I have formed him, I have also made him. <a href="http://bible.gospelcom.net/cgi-bin/bible?passage=Isa%2043:7&amp;version=ESV&amp;interface=print&amp;showfn=yes&amp;showxref">Isa 43:7</a>.  
</blockquote>
<p>The 
same applies in the previous and in the present chapters, as for example here in verse 3, 'He rested from all His work which God had created when making it'. Wherever these verbs occur the internal 
sense possesses a distinct concept, as it also does when the Lord is called Creator, or Former, or Maker.  </p>

<p align="center"><b>Latin(1748-1756) 88</b>
</p><b>88.</b>
Homo spiritualis cum fit caelestis, vocatur 'opus Dei' quia Dominus solus pugnavit pro eo, et eum creavit, formavit, et fecit; quare hic dicitur 'absolvit Deus in die septimo opus Suum,' et bis 'quievit 
ab omni opere Suo'.  Apud prophetas passim appellatur 'opus manuum et digitorum Jehovae,' ut apud Esaiam ubi de regenerato agitur, 	Sic dixit Jehovah, Sanctus Israelis, et Formator ejus, Signa petite 
a Me super filiis Meis, et super opere manuum Mearum praecipite Mihi. Ego feci terram, et hominem super ea 	creavi Ego, manus Meae extenderunt caelos, et omni exercitui illorum praecepi....Quia 
sic dixit Jehovah, creans caelos, 	Ille Deus formans terram, et faciens illam; Ille firmans illam, non vacuitatem {x}creavit eam, ad habitandum formavit eam; Ego Jehovah,...et nemo praeterea Deus praeter 
Me, {x}xlv 11, 12, 18, 21: </p>
<p>quod nova creatio, seu regeneratio, solius Domini opus sit, inde constat.  Satis distincte adhibentur voces creare, formare, et facere, ut hic apud Esaiam, 	Creans caelos, 
formans terram, et faciens illam, tum alibi, 	Omnem vocatum nomine Meo, et ad gloriam Meam creavi illum, formavi illum, etiam feci illum, xliii 7; </p>
<p>similiter in praecedente capite, et in hoc, ut 
hic, 'quievit ab omni opere Suo, quod creavit Deus faciendo'; et hoc semper cum distincta idea in sensu interno; tum ubi Dominus appellatur Creator, aut Formator, aut Factor.
