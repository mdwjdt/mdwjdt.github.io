<h3 align="center" class="ired">属天的奥秘 第1929节</h3>
<h4 align="center"></h4><p><strong>1929.</strong>从字义，尤其从历史事件的角度绝看不出，“耶和华的天使在旷野，往书珥路上的水泉旁遇见她”表示这类事物，因为字义或历史义距离表示这类事物极其遥远。然而，当世人阅读这些内容时，这就是进入天使头脑观念中的含义。因为天使对夏甲、水泉、旷野、路，以及书珥没有任何概念。这些事物没有一样能进入天使的脑海，反而在第一道门槛处就会消失。但天使理解“夏甲”、“水泉”、“旷野”、“路”，以及“书珥”分别表示什么，并由此形成天上的观念。这就是他们领悟主圣言的方式，因为对他们而言，内义才是圣言。</p>

That these things are signified by "the Angel of Jehovah finding Hagar at a fountain of waters in the wilderness, at the fountain in the way to Shur," can by no means appear from the literal sense, and 
the less so seeing that it is historical; for this sense seems very remote from signifying such things. But still this is the meaning that comes into the ideas of the angels when these things are read 
by man, for the angels have no idea of Hagar, nor of a fountain of waters, nor of a wilderness, nor of a way, nor of Shur. None of these things penetrate to the angels, but perish at the first threshold. 
But what is signified by "Hagar," by "a fountain," by "a wilderness," by "a way," and by "Shur," this they understand, and thereby form heavenly ideas, and in this way they perceive the Lord's 
Word; for the internal sense is the Word to them. </p>

That such things as these are meant by the statement that 'the angel of Jehovah found Hagar near a spring of water in the desert, near the spring on the road to Shur' cannot possibly be seen from the 
literal sense, still less when seen as an event in history; for this sense seems to be far removed from - meaning such things. Yet this is the very meaning which enters into the ideas present in the 
minds of angels when these descriptions are read by man. For angels have no idea in their minds of Hagar, or of a spring of water, or of a desert, or of a road, or of Shur. None of these come through 
to them, but perish at the threshold. It is that meant by Hagar, a spring, a desert, a road, or Shur, which they understand and from which they form heavenly ideas; and it is in this manner that they 
perceive the Word of the Lord, for to them the internal sense is the Word. </p>

</p><b>1929.</b>
Quod haec significentur per quod `angelus Jehovae invenerit Hagarem ad fontem aquarum in deserto, ad fontem in via Shur', nusquam apparere potest ex sensu litterali, et minus cum historicum est, qui 
sensus perquam remotus a significatione talium esse videtur; sed usque is est sensus qui venit in ideas angelorum cum ab homine haec leguntur; angeli enim nullam ideam habent Hagaris, nec fontis aquarum, 
nec deserti, nec viae, nec Shur; omnia haec non ad illos penetrant sed pereunt in primo limine; sed quid per `Hagarem,' per `fontem,' per `desertum,' per `viam,' et per `Shur' significatur, hoc intelligunt 
et inde formant ideas caelestes, et sic Verbum Domini percipiunt, nam sensus internus est illis Verbum. </p>
