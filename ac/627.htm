<h3 align="center" class="ired">属天的奥秘 第627节</h3>
<h4 align="center"></h4><p><strong>627.</strong>“凡有血肉的人，在地上都败坏了行为”表示人的肉体本性（man's corporeal nature）毁灭了对真理的一切觉知。这一点从“血肉”的含义（参看第3节）清楚看出来，“血肉”总体上表整个人类，具体表肉体人（corporeal man）或属身体的一切；也可从“行为”的含义清楚看出来，“行为”涉及对真理的觉知，或真理本身。“行为”涉及对真理的觉知，或真理本身，这一事实从前面以及下面所引用的经文明显可知：<br />耶和华说，你起来，赶快下去！因为你从埃及领出来的百姓已经败坏了自己。他们快快地偏离了我所吩咐的道，为自己铸成了偶像。（申命记<a href="http://39-27.cn/申9.11.htm">9:11</a>，<a href="http://39-27.cn/申9.16.htm">16</a>）<br />这表示他们离弃了祂的诫命，也就是真理。<br />②耶利米书：<br />注目人类子孙所有的行径，依照各人的行径和行事的结果报应他。（耶利米书<a href="http://39-27.cn/耶32.19.htm">32:19</a>）<br />“行径”表照着诫命的生活，“行事的结果”表基于仁爱的生活。相应地，“行径”涉及由诫命和条例组成的真理。“人类子孙”和“各人”的含义如前面所述。<br />耶利米书（<a href="http://39-27.cn/耶7.3.htm">7:3</a>；<a href="http://39-27.cn/耶17.10.htm">17:10</a>）也有同样的用法。<br />何西阿书：<br />我必因他们所行的惩罚他们，照他们所做的报应他们。（何西阿书<a href="http://39-27.cn/何4.9.htm">4:9</a>）<br />撒迦利亚书：<br />你们要回头离开你们的恶道恶行！万军之耶和华定意按我们的行动作为向我们怎样行，他已照样行了。（撒迦利亚书<a href="http://39-27.cn/亚1.4.htm">1:4</a>，<a href="http://39-27.cn/亚1.6.htm">6</a>）<br />这里出现了同样的词，但它们的含义却和前面的相反，因为它们是“恶道恶行”。<br />耶利米书：<br />我要使他们彼此同心同道。（耶利米书<a href="http://39-27.cn/耶32.39.htm">32:39</a>）<br />“心”表示良善，“道”表示真理。<br />诗篇：<br />求你将你的律例教训我。求你使我离开虚谎的路，施恩把你的律法赐给我。我拣定真理的道路。求你领我走你诫命的道路。（诗篇<a href="http://39-27.cn/诗119.26.htm">119:26</a>-<a href="http://39-27.cn/诗119.27.htm">27</a>，<a href="http://39-27.cn/诗119.29.htm">29</a>-<a href="http://39-27.cn/诗119.30.htm">30</a>，<a href="http://39-27.cn/诗119.32.htm">32</a>，<a href="http://39-27.cn/诗119.35.htm">35</a>）<br />“律例和诫命的路”被称为“真理的路”，与之相反的是“虚谎的路”。<br />③<br />耶和华啊，求你将你的道指示我，将你的路指教我！求你以你的真理引导我，教训我。（诗篇<a href="http://39-27.cn/诗25.4.htm">25:4</a>-<a href="http://39-27.cn/诗25.5.htm">5</a>）<br />这里的“道”显然同样表示真理。<br />以赛亚书：<br />耶和华与谁商议，谁教导祂，谁将公平的路指示祂，将知识教训祂，又把明智的路教导祂？（以赛亚书<a href="http://39-27.cn/赛40.14.htm">40:14</a>）<br />这明显表示对真理的觉知。<br />耶利米书：<br />耶和华如此说，你们当站在路上察看，访问古道，哪是善道，便行在其间。（耶利米书<a href="http://39-27.cn/耶6.16.htm">6:16</a>）<br />这里的“路”同样表示对真理的觉知。<br />以赛亚书：<br />我要引瞎子行不认识的道，领他们走不知道的路。（以赛亚书<a href="http://39-27.cn/赛42.16.htm">42:16</a>）<br />“路”、“大道”、“道”和“街道”这些术语全都用来称谓真理，因为它们通向真理。如耶利米书：<br />使他们在所行的路上，在古道上绊跌，使他们行没有修筑的斜路。（耶利米书<a href="http://39-27.cn/耶18.15.htm">18:15</a>）<br />士师记：<br />在珊迦的时候，大道无人行走，都是绕道而行。以色列的街道消失了（The streets ceased in Israel）（士师记<a href="http://39-27.cn/士5.6.htm">5:6</a>）。</p>

<p><strong>[NCE]627.</strong> The meaning of because all flesh had made their way corrupt on the earth as the fact that humankind's preoccupation with the bodily level destroyed all comprehension of truth is established by the symbolism of flesh. At verse <a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_627/bible_king-james-version_genesis_6_3" target=_top>3</a> above [<a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_627/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_574" target=_top>574</a>], flesh was described as symbolizing every person in general and one with a bodily focus in particular, or in other words, the whole bodily realm. A way symbolizes the comprehension of truth, or truth itself.<br />The use of way or path to describe a comprehension of truth, or truth itself, can be gathered from passages quoted in various places above [<a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_627/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_519" target=_top>519:1</a>, <a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_627/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_612#subsection-2-3" target=_top>612:3</a>, <a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_627/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_622" target=_top>622</a>, <a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_627/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_623#subsection-2-2" target=_top>623:2</a>]. The following passages also illustrate the connection. In Moses:<br />Jehovah said, "Get up; go down quickly from here, because your people have corrupted themselves, they have suddenly turned back from the way that I commanded them. They have made themselves a cast image." (<a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_627/bible_king-james-version_deuteronomy_9_12" target=_top>Deuteronomy 9:12</a>, <a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_627/bible_king-james-version_deuteronomy_9_16" target=_top>16</a>)<br />In this passage it is commandments, which are truths, that were abandoned.<br />[2] In Jeremiah:<br />... whose eyes are open to all the ways of the sons of humankind, to reward a man according to his ways and according to the fruit of his deeds. (<a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_627/bible_king-james-version_jeremiah_32_19" target=_top>Jeremiah 32:19</a>)<br />These "ways" are a life spent obeying what has been commanded, and the fruit of a person's deeds is a life inspired by charity. So a way relates to truth, truth being contained in the things commanded and required of us. A son of humankind and a man carry the same connotation, as shown before [<a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_627/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_158" target=_top>158</a>, <a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_627/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_264" target=_top>264</a>, <a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_627/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_489" target=_top>489</a>, <a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_627/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_568#subsection-2-2" target=_top>568:2</a>]. These symbols have the same meaning in <a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_627/bible_king-james-version_jeremiah_7_3" target=_top>Jeremiah 7:3</a> and <a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_627/bible_king-james-version_jeremiah_17_10" target=_top>17:10</a>. In Hosea:<br />I will bring on them the consequences of their ways, and their deeds will I return on them. (<a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_627/bible_king-james-version_hosea_4_9" target=_top>Hosea 4:9</a>)<br />In Zechariah:<br />"Turn back from your evil ways and your evil deeds." As Jehovah Sabaoth thought to do to us according to our ways and according to our deeds ... (<a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_627/bible_king-james-version_zechariah_1_4" target=_top>Zechariah 1:4</a>, <a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_627/bible_king-james-version_zechariah_1_6" target=_top>6</a>)<br />The meaning here is similar to that in the earlier passages, though turned around, since the ways and deeds are evil. In Jeremiah:<br />I will give them one heart and one way. (<a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_627/bible_king-james-version_jeremiah_32_39" target=_top>Jeremiah 32:39</a>)<br />A heart stands for goodness, and a way, for truth. In David:<br />Make me understand the way of your requirements. Remove the way of falsehood from me, and favor me with your law. I have chosen the way of truth. I will run the way of your commandments. (<a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_627/bible_king-james-version_psalms_119_26-27" target=_top>Psalms 119:26-27</a>, <a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_627/bible_king-james-version_psalms_119_29-30" target=_top>29-30</a>, <a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_627/bible_king-james-version_psalms_119_32" target=_top>32</a>, <a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_627/bible_king-james-version_psalms_119_35" target=_top>35</a>)<br />The way of the divine requirements and commandments is being referred to as the way of truth, and the opposite, as the way of falsehood.<br />[3] In the same author:<br />Make your ways known to me, Jehovah; teach me your paths. Lead the way for me in your truth and teach me. (<a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_627/bible_king-james-version_psalms_25_4-5" target=_top>Psalms 25:4-5</a>)<br />Again the way clearly stands for truth. In Isaiah:<br />With whom has Jehovah taken counsel, and [who] has instructed him, and taught him the path of judgment, and taught him knowledge, and made the way of understanding known to him? (<a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_627/bible_king-james-version_isaiah_40_14" target=_top>Isaiah 40:14</a>)<br />Obviously the way stands for a comprehension of truth. In Jeremiah:<br />This is what Jehovah has said: "Stand on the footways and see, and ask about the ancient paths — which way is the good one — and go on it." (<a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_627/bible_king-james-version_jeremiah_6_16" target=_top>Jeremiah 6:16</a>)<br />Once again the way stands for a comprehension of truth. In Isaiah:<br />I will lead the blind on a way they have not known; in paths they have not known I will lead them. (<a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_627/bible_king-james-version_isaiah_42_16" target=_top>Isaiah 42:16</a>)<br />Words used to describe truth include way, path, road, street, and lane, because these lead to truth. Jeremiah contains an example:<br />They caused them to stumble on their way, on the ancient roads, to go on the paths, on a way that was not paved. (<a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_627/bible_king-james-version_jeremiah_18_15" target=_top>Jeremiah 18:15</a>)<br />Likewise in Judges:<br />In the days of Jael, the roads disappeared, and those going on the paths went by crooked roads. The lanes in Israel disappeared. (<a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_627/bible_king-james-version_judges_5_6-7" target=_top>Judges 5:6-7</a>) </p>
<p align="center"><b>Potts(1905-1910) 627</b></p><p><b>627.</b>
For all flesh had corrupted its way upon the earth. That this signifies that man's corporeal nature had destroyed all the understanding of truth, is evident from the signification of "flesh" (concerning 
which at verse 3), which in general means every man, and in particular the corporeal man, or all that is of the body; and from the signification of a "way" as being the understanding of truth, that 
is, truth itself. That a "way" is predicated of the understanding of truth, that is, of truth, is evident from passages which have been adduced in different places before, and also from the following. 
In Moses: </p>
<blockquote>
	<p>Jehovah said, Arise, get thee down quickly from hence; for thy people have corrupted themselves; they have suddenly turned back out of the way which I commanded them; they have made 
them a molten image (Deut. 9:12, 16), </p>
</blockquote>
<p>     meaning that they had turned away from the commandments, which are truths. </p>
<p>     <b>[2]</b> In Jeremiah: </p>
<p>     Whose eyes are open upon all the ways of the sons of man, to 
give every man according to his ways, and according to the fruit of his works (Jer. 32:19).The "ways" here are a life according to the commandments; the "fruit of his works" is a life from charity. Thus 
a "way" is predicated of truths, which are those of the precepts and commandments. And the meaning of "son of man" [homo] and of "man" [vir] is as has been shown above. So in Jeremiah 7:3, and 17:10. 
In Hosea: </p>
<blockquote>
	<p>I will visit upon him his ways, and render to him his works (Hos. 4:9). 
	</p>
</blockquote>
<p>     In Zechariah: </p>
<blockquote>
	<p>Return ye from your evil ways, and from your evil works. Like as Jehovah Zebaoth thought 
to do unto us according to our ways, and according to our works (Zech. 1:4, 6). 
	</p>
</blockquote>
<p>     Here the sense is similar, but the opposite of the former, because they are evil "ways" and evil "works." In Jeremiah: </p>
<blockquote>
	<p>I will give them one heart, and one way (Jer. 32:39).</p>
</blockquote>
<p> 
    "Heart" denotes goods, and "way" truths. In David: </p>
<blockquote>
	<p>Make me to understand the way of Thy commandments; remove from me the way of falsehood; 
and grant me Thy law graciously. I have chosen the way of truth. I will run the way of Thy commandments (Ps. 119:27, 29-30, 32). 
	</p>
</blockquote>
<p>     Here the "way of the commandments" is called the "way of truth"-opposite 
to which is the "way of falsehood." </p>
<p>     <b>[3]</b> Again: </p>
<blockquote>
	<p>Make known to me Thy ways, O Jehovah, teach me Thy paths. Lead my way in Thy truth, and teach me (Ps. 25:4-5). 
	</p>
</blockquote>
<p>     Here likewise a "way" 
manifestly denotes truth. In Isaiah: </p>
<p>     With whom did Jehovah take counsel, and who instructed Him, and taught Him the path of judgment, and taught Him knowledge [scientia], and made Him to know the 
way of understanding (Isa. 40:14), manifestly for the understanding of truth. In Jeremiah: </p>
<blockquote>
	<p>Thus hath said Jehovah, Stand ye upon the ways and see, and ask for the old paths, where is the good 
way, and go therein (Jer. 6:16). </p>
</blockquote>
<p>     Here likewise "way" is put for the understanding of truth. In Isaiah: </p>
<blockquote>
	<p>I will lead the blind in a way that they knew not, in paths that they have not known I will 
lead them (Isa. 42:16). </p>
</blockquote>
<p>     The terms "way" "path" [semita], "path" [trames], "street" [platea], and "street" [vicus] are predicated of truth, because they lead to truth; as also in Jeremiah: They have 
caused them to stumble in their ways, in the ancient paths, to walk in by-paths, in a way not cast up (Jer. 18:15). So in the book of Judges: </p>
<blockquote>
	<p>In the days of Jael the paths ceased, and they that 
walked in paths went through crooked paths. The streets ceased in Israel (Judg. 5:6).
	</p>
</blockquote>

'For all flesh had corrupted its way upon the earth<A name="fntext1"></a><A href="#fn1"><sup>a</sup></a>' means that man's bodily-mindedness destroyed all understanding of truth. This is clear from the meaning of 'flesh', dealt with already at verse 3, 
as in general the whole of mankind, and in particular the bodily-minded man, or everything of a bodily nature; and from the meaning of 'way' as the understanding of truth, or truth itself. The fact 
that 'way' has reference to the understanding of truth, or to truth itself, becomes clear from the examples already quoted in several places as well as from the following,  </p>
<blockquote>
Jehovah said, Get up, go 
down quickly from here, for your people have corrupted themselves. They have suddenly turned aside from the way which I commanded them. They have cast for themselves a metal image. <a href="http://bible.gospelcom.net/cgi-bin/bible?passage=Deut%209:11,%2016&amp;version=ESV&amp;interface=print&amp;showfn=yes&amp;showxref">Deut 9:11, 16</a>. 
</blockquote>
<p>This 
means that they forsook His commandments, which are truths. </p>
<p></p>
<p><b>[2]</b>
 In Jeremiah, </p>
<blockquote>
Whose eyes have been opened upon all the ways of the sons of man, giving to every man (vir) according to his ways 
and according to the fruit of his works <a href="http://bible.gospelcom.net/cgi-bin/bible?passage=Jer%2032:19&amp;version=ESV&amp;interface=print&amp;showfn=yes&amp;showxref">Jer 32:19</a>. 
</blockquote>
<p>'Ways' means life according to the commandments, 'fruit of his works' life based on charity. 'Way' accordingly has reference to truths, which 
comprise commandments and ordinances, and so do 'son of man' and 'man' (vir), as shown above. <a href="http://bible.gospelcom.net/cgi-bin/bible?passage=Jer%207:3;%2017:10&amp;version=ESV&amp;interface=print&amp;showfn=yes&amp;showxref">Jer 7:3; 17:10</a>, also contain similar usages. </p>
<p>In Hosea, </p>
<blockquote>
	<p>I will visit upon him his ways, and require 
him for his works. 
	<a href="http://bible.gospelcom.net/cgi-bin/bible?passage=Hosea%204:9&amp;version=ESV&amp;interface=print&amp;showfn=yes&amp;showxref">Hosea 4:9</a>. 
	</p>
</blockquote>
<p>In Zechariah,  </p>
<blockquote>
Return from your evil ways and from your evil works. As Jehovah Zebaoth thought to deal with us for our ways and for our works. <a href="http://bible.gospelcom.net/cgi-bin/bible?passage=Zech%201:4,%206&amp;version=ESV&amp;interface=print&amp;showfn=yes&amp;showxref">Zech 1:4, 6</a>.  
</blockquote>
<p>Similar 
phrases appear here, yet they are the contrary in meaning to those mentioned before them, since they are 'evil ways' and 'evil works'.  </p>
<p>In Jeremiah, </p>
<blockquote>
I will give them one heart and one way. 
<a href="http://bible.gospelcom.net/cgi-bin/bible?passage=Jer%2032:39&amp;version=ESV&amp;interface=print&amp;showfn=yes&amp;showxref">Jer 32:39</a>. 
</blockquote>
<p>'Heart' stands for goods, 'way' for truths. In David, </p>
<blockquote>
Make me understand the way of Your commandments. Take from me the way of untruth, and graciously grant me Your law. I have chosen 
the way of truth. I will run in the way of Your precepts. <a href="http://bible.gospelcom.net/cgi-bin/bible?passage=Ps%20119:26,%2027,%2029,%2030,%2032,%2035&amp;version=ESV&amp;interface=print&amp;showfn=yes&amp;showxref">Ps 119:26, 27, 29, 30, 32, 35</a>. 
</blockquote>
<p>Here 'the way of the commandments and precepts' is called 'the way of truth', and the contrary of this, 'the 
way of untruth'.  </p>
<p></p>
<p><b>[3]</b>
 In the same author, </p>
<blockquote>
Make Your ways known to me, O Jehovah, teach me Your paths, guide my way in Your truth, and teach me. <a href="http://bible.gospelcom.net/cgi-bin/bible?passage=Ps%2025:4,%205&amp;version=ESV&amp;interface=print&amp;showfn=yes&amp;showxref">Ps 25:4, 5</a>. 
</blockquote>
<p>This in like manner plainly stands 
for the truth. In Isaiah,  </p>
<blockquote>
With whom did Jehovah consult, and he instructed Him, and taught Him the path of judgement, and taught Him knowledge, and made Him know the way of understanding? <a href="http://bible.gospelcom.net/cgi-bin/bible?passage=Isa%2040:14&amp;version=ESV&amp;interface=print&amp;showfn=yes&amp;showxref">Isa 40:14</a>. 
</blockquote>
<p>This plainly stands for an understanding of truth. In Jeremiah, </p>
<blockquote>
Thus said Jehovah, Stand upon the highways and look, and ask concerning the paths of old, which is the good way, and go in 
it. <a href="http://bible.gospelcom.net/cgi-bin/bible?passage=Jer%206:16&amp;version=ESV&amp;interface=print&amp;showfn=yes&amp;showxref">Jer 6:16</a>. 
</blockquote>
<p>This in like manner stands for an understanding of truth. In Isaiah, </p>
<blockquote>
I will lead the blind in a way they do not know; and in paths they do not know I will guide them. <a href="http://bible.gospelcom.net/cgi-bin/bible?passage=Isa%2042:16&amp;version=ESV&amp;interface=print&amp;showfn=yes&amp;showxref">Isa 42:16</a>. 
</blockquote>
<p>The 
expressions way, by-path, pathway, road, and street all have reference to truths because they lead to what is true, as also in Jeremiah, </p>
<blockquote>
They have caused them to stumble in their ways, in 
the pathways of old, going into by-paths and not the highway. <a href="http://bible.gospelcom.net/cgi-bin/bible?passage=Jer%2018:15&amp;version=ESV&amp;interface=print&amp;showfn=yes&amp;showxref">Jer 18:15</a>. 
</blockquote>
<p>Similarly in the Book of Judges, </p>
<blockquote>
In the days of Jael pathways ceased to be. And those who went along the paths kept to twisting 
pathways; the streets in Israel ceased to be. <a href="http://bible.gospelcom.net/cgi-bin/bible?passage=Judg%205:6,%207&amp;version=ESV&amp;interface=print&amp;showfn=yes&amp;showxref">Judg 5:6, 7</a>.

omnis homo, in specie corporeus, seu omne corporeum; et ex significatione 'viae' quod sit intellectus veri, seu ipsa veritas: quod 'via' praedicetur de intellectu veri, seu de veritate, constare potest 
ab illis quae allata sunt prius passim, et praeterea ab his quae sequuntur; apud Mosen, 	Dixit Jehovah, Surge, descende cito hinc, quia corrupit se populus tuus,... recesserunt subito de via, quam 
praecepi eis, fecerunt sibi fusile, Deut. ix 12, 16; </p>
<p>ibi a praeceptis, quae sunt veritates: [2] apud Jeremiam,   	Cujus oculi aperti sunt super omnes vias filiorum hominis, ad dandum viro juxta vias 
ejus, et juxta fructum operum ejus, xxxii 19; </p>
<p>'viae' sunt vita secundum praecepta, 'fructus operum' est vita ex charitate; ita 'via' praedicatur de veris, quae sunt praeceptorum et mandatorum; sicut 
etiam 'filius hominis, et 'vir,' ut supra ostensum: similiter, Jer. vii 3; xvii 10: apud Hosheam, 	Visitabo super eum vias ejus, et opera ejus reddam ei, iv 9: </p>
<p>apud Zachariam, 	Revertimini a viis 
vestris malis, et operibus vestris malis:...sicut cogitavit Jehovah Zebaoth facere nobis juxta vias nostras, et juxta opera nostra, i 4, 6; </p>
<p>              similiter, sed contraria prioribus, quia viae 
malae, et opera mala: apud Jeremiam, 	Dabo iis cor unum, et viam unam, xxxii 39; </p>
<p>'cor' pro bonis, et 'via' pro veris: apud Davidem, 	Viam mandatorum Tuorum fac me intelligere.... Viam mendacii remove 
a me; et legem Tuam gratiose largire mihi.  Viam veritatis elegi.... Viam praeceptorum Tuorum curram, 	Ps. cxix 26, 27, 29, 30, 32, 35; </p>
<p>ubi 'via mandatorum et praeceptorum' dicitur via veritatis; 
cui contraria 3 'via mendacii': apud eundem, 	Vias Tuas Jehovah notas fac mihi, tramites Tuos doce 	me, duc viam meam in veritate Tua, et doce me, Ps. xxv 4, 5; </p>
<p>similiter manifeste pro veritate: 
apud Esaiam, 	Cum quo consiliatus est Jehovah, et instruxit Ipsum, et docuit Ipsum semitam judicii, et docuit Ipsum scientiam, et viam intelligentiarum nosse fecit Ipsi?" xl 14; </p>
<p>manifeste pro intellectu 
veri: apud Jeremiam, 	Sic dixit Jehovah, State super viis, et videte, et quaerite de semitis saeculi, quae sit via bona, et ite in 	illa, vi 16; </p>
<p>similiter pro intellectu veri: apud Esaiam, 	Ducam 
caecos in via non noverunt, in semitis non noverunt, ducam eos, xlii 16; </p>
<p>de veris praedicantur 'et via, et semita, et trames, et platea, et vicus,' quia ducunt ad verum; ut etiam apud Jeremiam, 	Impingere 
fecerunt eos in viis eorum, tramitibus saeculi, ad eundum semitas, viam non stratam, xviii 15: </p>
<p>similiter in Libro Judicum, 	In diebus Jaelis cessarunt tramites, et euntes semitas, iverunt 
tramites tortuosos; cessarunt vici in Israel, v 6, [7]. </p>
