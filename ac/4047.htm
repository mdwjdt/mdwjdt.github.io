<h3 align="center" class="ired">属天的奥秘 第4047节</h3>
<h4 align="center"></h4><p><strong>4047.</strong>还有些灵人出现在头顶上，他们在头上所流入的共同行动以交叉的方式从前面向后流过。又有些灵人出现，他们所流入的行动是从两个太阳穴流向脑部中间。我发觉他们属于软脑膜区域，软脑膜是另一种覆盖物，更紧密地围绕大小脑，并通过它自身所发出的线状物而与它们相通。我蒙允许通过他们的言谈了解他们的秉性，因为他们与我交谈。他们和在世时一样，也是不那么信靠自己的思想，因而对于神圣事物，不让自己遵从任何确定的思想，而是依赖其他人所信的，也不进行调查，查看事情是不是真的。当我背诵主祷文时，他们的这种独特性质通过他们的感知进入主祷文的流注向我显明。因为所有灵人与天使的独特性质，无论这些性质有多少，都能从主祷文得知，并且通过构成他们的思维和情感的观念进入主祷文内容的流注得知。我还由此发觉，这就是这些灵人的独特性质，而且他们能作为媒介而服务于天使。因为诸天堂之间有中间灵人，交流通过他们实现。因为他们的观念没有被关闭，而是能被打开，所以他们通过允许轻易进入来自天使的流注并悦纳它而让自己被作用。而且，这些灵人都很谦逊、平和；他们说，他们在天上。</p>

There appeared others also above the head, whose common action inflowing above the head flowed crosswise from the front backward. And there appeared also others, whose inflowing action was from each 
temple toward the middle of the brain. It was perceived that these were those who belong to the province of the pia mater, which is the second integument, more closely investing the cerebrum and cerebellum, 
and communicating with these by the emission of threads. The quality of these I was permitted to know from their speech, for they spoke with me. They were (as they had been in the world) such as 
did not trust much to their own thought, and therefore did not determine themselves to any fixed and certain thought respecting holy things, but depended on the belief of others, not canvassing whether 
it was true. That this was their quality was also shown me by the influx of their perception into the Lord's prayer when I was reading it. For the quality of all spirits and angels whatever may be 
known from the Lord's prayer, and this by the influx of the ideas of their thought and of their affections into the contents of the prayer. From this was perceived the quality of these spirits, and furthermore 
that they could serve the angels as mediums; for there are intermediate spirits between the heavens through whom there is communication. For their ideas were not closed, but were readily opened 
so that they suffered themselves to be acted upon, easily admitting and receiving influx. Moreover, they were modest and peaceful, and said that they were in heaven. </p>

Others also appeared overhead whose collective action, inflowing above the head, was passing in a crosswise manner from the front backwards, and others again whose inflowing action was passing from both 
temples towards the middle of the brain. I perceived that they were spirits who belonged to the province of the pia mater, which is another covering and which surrounds the cerebrum and cerebellum 
more closely and communicates with them by means of fine cords sent out from itself. I was allowed to know the character of these spirits from their speech, for they talked to me. They were the same 
as they had been in the world, in that they did not have much confidence in their own thinking, and so did not commit themselves to any definite thought about holy things, but relied on what others believed 
without testing it to see whether it was true. This particular nature of theirs was also shown to me by an influx of their perception into the Lord's Prayer when I was reciting it. For the particular 
natures of all spirits and angels, however many these may be, may be known from the Lord's Prayer - through the influx of the ideas comprising their thought and affections into the contents of 
that prayer. From this also I perceived that such was the particular nature of these spirits, and in addition that they were able to serve angels as intermediaries. For there are intermediate spirits 
between the heavens through whom communication is effected. Their ideas were not closed but capable of being opened, and so they permitted things to happen to them by allowing an easy entry to influx 
from the angels and welcoming it. What was more, those spirits were unassuming and peaceable; and they said they were in heaven. </p>

Apparebant quoque alii supra caput quorum actio communis influens {1}supra caput erat fluida transversim ab anteriore retrorsum; et apparebant quoque alii, (x)quorum actio influens erat a tempore 
utroque versus meditullium cerebri; perceptum quod illi essent qui pertinerent ad provinciam piae matris, quae est integumentum alterum, et propius investit cerebrum et cerebellum, et per fila emissa 
cum illis communicat; quales essent, scire dabatur ex loquela eorum, nam mecum locuti sunt; fuerunt sicut in mundo, quod non multum suae cogitationi fiderent, et sic se determinarent ad aliquid 
certum cogitare de rebus sanctis, sed quod penderent ab aliorum fide, non ventilantes num verum esset; quod tales essent, etiam ostensum mihi per influxum perceptionis illorum in Orationem Domini cum 
illam legerem, nam omnes quotcumque sunt spiritus et angeli, ex oratione Domini sciri potuerunt quales essent, et hoc per influxum idearum cogitationis et affectionum illorum in contenta orationis; 
inde etiam perceptum quod tales essent; et insuper quod inservire possent angelis pro mediis; sunt enim spiritus medii inter caelos per quos communicatio, ideae enim illorum non erant clausae sed 
apertiles, ita illi patientes se agi, et facile admittentes est excipientes influxum; praeterea erant modesti et pacifici; ac dicebant se esse in caelo. @1 A has supra cerebrum, but SD 1727, from 
which this is copied, has in cerebro, a much likelier reading.$ </p>
