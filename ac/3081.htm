<h3 align="center" class="ired">属天的奥秘 第3081节</h3>
<h4 align="center"></h4><p><strong>3081.</strong>“还是处女，也未曾有人亲近她”表于一切虚假是洁净的。这从“处女”的含义清楚可知。“处女（或童女）”在圣言中经常被提及，在那里表示主的国度，同样表示教义，因而表示为主国度或教会的每个人。“处女（或童女）”具有这样的含义，是因为婚姻之爱就存在于贞洁的处女里面。就属灵之义而言，婚姻之爱是指对存在于真理中的良善的情感，和对基于良善的真理的情感；当这些情感可以说在婚姻中结合时，婚姻之爱便从它们流出（参看<a href="2508.htm">2508</a>，<a href="2618.htm">2618</a>，<a href="2727.htm">2727</a>-<a href="2729.htm">2729</a>节）。由于如前所述，婚姻之爱体现在处女或童女身上，故主的国度被称为“童女”，它也好比婚姻并被称作婚姻。“未曾有人亲近她”表从一切虚假中洁净，这是因为在圣言中，“人（即男人man）”不仅表理性真理，还在反面意义上表虚假（参看<a href="265.htm">265</a>，<a href="749.htm">749</a>，<a href="1007.htm">1007</a>节）；因此，“被人（男人）亲近”表被虚假玷污，“未被人（男人）亲近”表于虚假是洁净的。“人或男人”在此有丈夫的意义。<br />在圣言中，“处女或童女”表示那些在主国度里面，或也可说，主国度在其里面的人。这明显可见于启示录：<br />这些人未曾沾染妇女，他们原是童身；羔羊无论往哪里去，他们都跟随，因为他们在神宝座前是没有瑕疵的。（启示录<a href="http://39-27.cn/启14.4.htm">14:4</a>-<a href="http://39-27.cn/启14.5.htm">5</a>）<br />显然，那些“跟随羔羊”的人，也就是在主国度里的人被称为“童身”；经上还说他们“没有瑕疵”。<br />严格来说，那些由对主之爱所主导的人，也就是属天之人，因而那些处于对良善的情感之人才是“童女或童身”。那些由对邻之仁所主导的人，也就是属灵之人，因而那些处于对真理的情感之人也被称作“童女或童身”。这从以下圣言经文可以看出来，以赛亚书：<br />锡安的处女藐视你、嗤笑你；耶路撒冷的女子在你后面摇头。（以赛亚书<a href="http://39-27.cn/赛37.22.htm">37:22</a>）<br />这些话是对亚述王说的。“锡安的处女”表属天教会，“耶路撒冷的女子”表属灵教会。<br />耶利米书：<br />以色列的处女哪，我要再建立你，你就被建立；你必再以手鼓为装饰，出去和那些快乐的人一同跳舞。他们的心必像浇灌的园子，他们也不再有一点愁烦。那时，处女必快乐跳舞，年少的、年老的也必一同快乐。（耶利米书<a href="http://39-27.cn/耶31.4.htm">31:4</a>，<a href="http://39-27.cn/耶31.12.htm">12</a>-<a href="http://39-27.cn/耶31.13.htm">13</a>）<br />“以色列的处女”表属灵教会。对源于该教会所具有的良善之真理的情感在此处和别处被描述为“手鼓和跳舞”。同一先知书：<br />锡安的路径就哀伤，她的祭司叹息，她的处女悲伤。主因犹大的处女践踏压酒池。看我的痛苦，我的处女和少年人都被掳去。（耶利米哀歌<a href="http://39-27.cn/哀1.4.htm">1:4</a>，<a href="http://39-27.cn/哀1.15.htm">15</a>，<a href="http://39-27.cn/哀1.18.htm">18</a>）<br />“处女”表对良善与真理的情感。<br />妇人在锡安被玷辱，处女在犹大城市被奸污。（耶利米哀歌<a href="http://39-27.cn/哀5.11.htm">5:11</a>）<br />此处“处女”表对良善的情感。<br />阿摩司书：<br />他们往来奔跑寻求耶和华的话，却寻不着。当那日，美貌的处女和少年的男子必因干渴发昏。（阿摩司书<a href="http://39-27.cn/摩8.12.htm">8:12</a>-<a href="http://39-27.cn/摩8.13.htm">13</a>）<br />“美貌的处女”表对真理的情感，“少年的男子”表真理，或也可说，表那些具有真理的人；关于这些人，经上说“他们往来奔跑寻求耶和华的话，却寻不着”，结果“必因干渴发昏”。<br />撒迦利亚书：<br />当那日，耶和华他们的神必看祂的百姓如羊群；因为祂的美善何等大！祂的荣美何其盛！ 五谷健壮少男；新酒培养处女。（撒迦利亚书<a href="http://39-27.cn/亚9.16.htm">9:16</a>-<a href="http://39-27.cn/亚9.17.htm">17</a>）“少男”表真理，“处女”表情感。诗篇：<br />王女在里面极其荣华，她的衣服是用金线绣的。她要穿锦绣的衣服，被引到王前；随从她的陪伴童女也要被带到你面前。（诗篇<a href="http://39-27.cn/诗45.13.htm">45:13</a>-<a href="http://39-27.cn/诗45.14.htm">14</a>）<br />“王女”表主的属灵国度。“随从她的陪伴童女”表对真理的情感。<br />诗篇：<br />神啊，他们已经看见你行进，我的神之行进入圣所。歌唱的行在前，弹琴作乐的随在后，都在击鼓的少女中间。（诗篇<a href="http://39-27.cn/诗68.24.htm">68:24</a>-<a href="http://39-27.cn/诗68.25.htm">25</a>）<br />“击鼓的少女”也表对真理的情感。不过，在表达纯真方面，“少女”不同于“处女”。“处女”因婚姻之爱而被如此称呼，因而表纯真之人，因为婚姻之爱就是纯真本身（参看<a href="2736.htm">2736</a>节）。因此，在启示录所引用的经文中，经上说“羔羊无论往哪里去，他们都跟随”，因为“羔羊”表主的纯真。此外，凡在天堂者因存在于其良善中的纯真都被称为“处女或童女”。他们照存在于那良善中的纯真的质和量而“跟随羔羊”。</p>

A virgin, neither had any man known her. That this signifies pure from all falsity, is evident from the signification of a "virgin." A "virgin" is often mentioned in the Word, and there signifies the 
Lord's kingdom, and likewise the church, and consequently everyone who is a kingdom of the Lord or who is a church; and this from the conjugial love in chaste virgins. In the spiritual sense conjugial 
love is the affection of good in truth, and the affection of truth from good, from which affections, conjoined as it were in marriage, comes conjugial love (see n. 2508, 2618, 2727-2729). And because 
as before said this is seen in a virgin, the kingdom of the Lord, which is also compared to marriage and is called a marriage, is called a "virgin." That by "a man had not known her," is signified pure 
from all falsity, is because by a "man" in the Word is signified not only rational truth, but also in the opposite sense falsity (see n. 265, 749, 1007); thus to be "known by a man" is to be contaminated 
with falsity, and "not to be known by a man" is to be pure from falsity: by a "man" is not here meant a husband [vir conjugii]. [2] That by a "virgin" in the Word are signified those who are 
in the kingdom of the Lord, or what is the same, those in whom the kingdom of the Lord is, is evident in John: </p>
<p>     These are they who were not defiled with women, for they are virgins; these are they 
who follow the Lamb whithersoever He goeth, for they are without spot before the throne of God (Rev. 14:4-5). Here those are plainly called "virgins" who follow the Lamb, that is, who are in the Lord's 
kingdom; and they are also said to be "without spot." [3] In the proper sense, those are "virgins" who are in love to the Lord, that is, the celestial, and thus those who are in the affection of 
good. Those also are called "virgins" who are in charity toward the neighbor, that is, the spiritual, and thus who are in the affection of truth; as may be seen from passages in the Word. Thus in Isaiah: </p>
<p> 
    The virgin daughter of Zion hath despised thee, and hath mocked thee; the daughter of Jerusalem hath shaken her head after thee (Isa. 37:22). This is said to the king of Asshur; the "virgin 
daughter of Zion" denotes the celestial church; the "daughter of Jerusalem," the spiritual church. [4] In Jeremiah: </p>
<p>     Again will I build thee, and thou shalt be built, O virgin of Israel; again 
shalt thou deck thy timbrels, and shalt go forth in the dance of them that make merry. Their soul shall be as a watered garden; and they shall not sorrow any more at all. Then shall the virgin be glad 
in the dance, and the young men and the old together (Jer. 31:4, 12-13). The "virgin of Israel" denotes the spiritual church; the affection of truth from good in this church is described here, as in 
other places, by "timbrels and dances." In the same: </p>
<p>     The ways of Zion do mourn, her priests do sigh, her virgins are sad. The Lord hath trodden the winepress, for the virgin daughter of Judah. 
Behold my sorrow; my virgins and my young men are gone into captivity (Lam. 1:4, 15, 18). "Virgins" denote the affections of good and of truth. And again in the same: </p>
<p>     The women in Zion were ravished, 
the virgins in the cities of Judah (Lam. 5:11). Here the "virgins" denote the affections of good. [5] In Amos: </p>
<p>     They shall run to and fro to seek the word of Jehovah, and shall not find 
it. In that day shall the fair virgins and the young men faint for thirst (Amos 8:12-13). The "fair virgins" denote the affections of truth; the "young men," truths, or what is the same, those who are 
in them; concerning these it is said that "they shall run to and fro to seek the word of Jehovah, and shall not find it," and consequently "they shall faint for thirst." [6] In Zechariah: </p>
<p>     Jehovah 
their God shall preserve them in that day, as the flock of His people; for how great is His goodness and how great is His beauty: corn shall make the young men grow [germinare], and new wine the 
virgins (Zech. 9:16-17); </p>
<p>"young men" denoting truths, and "virgins," affections. In David: </p>
<p>     The King's daughter is all glorious within; her clothing is of inweavings of gold. She is led unto the 
King in broidered work; the virgins, her companions, that follow her, are brought unto Thee (Ps. 45:13-14). The "King's daughter" denotes the Lord's spiritual kingdom; the "virgins, her companions, 
that follow her," denote the affections of truth. [7] In the same: </p>
<p>     They have seen Thy goings, O God, the goings of my God in, the sanctuary. The singers went before, the players on the harp followed 
after, in the midst of the damsels playing the timbrels (Ps. 68:24-25). The "damsels playing the timbrels" also denote the affections of truth, the term "virgin" being used in distinction from 
 to express innocence. "Virgins" are so called from conjugial love, and thus denote those who are in innocence; for conjugial love is innocence itself (see n. 2736). In John therefore in the passage 
quoted from Revelation, they are said to "follow the Lamb whithersoever He goeth;" for by the "Lamb" is meant the Lord as to innocence; and all who are in heaven are called "virgins" from the innocence 
which is in their good. According to the amount and quality of the innocence in good, they "follow the Lamb." </p>

<p align="center"><b>Elliott(1983-1999) 3081</b></p><p><b>3081.</b>
'A virgin, and no man had known her' means pure from everything false. This is clear from the meaning of 'a virgin'. The word 'virgin' occurs in various places in the Word, where it means the Lord's 
kingdom, and also the Church, and therefore means every person who is the Lord's kingdom or who is the Church; and it receives this meaning from conjugial love which exists in chaste virgins. Conjugial 
love in the spiritual sense is the affection for good present in truth, and the affection for truth grounded in good, from which affections, when joined so to speak in marriage, conjugial love flows, 
see <a href="2508.htm">2508</a>, <a href="2618.htm">2618</a>, <a href="2727.htm">2727</a>- <a href="2729.htm">2729</a>. And because conjugial love, as has been stated, is seen in a virgin, the Lord's kingdom, which is also compared to and actually called a marriage, is called a virgin. The 
reason 'no man had known her' means pure from everything false is that 'a man' (vir) in the Word means not only rational truth but also in the contrary sense falsity, see <a href="265.htm">265</a>, <a href="749.htm">749</a>,<a href="1007.htm">1007</a>, so that 'known 
by a man' means defiled by falsity, and 'not known by a man' pure from falsity. The word 'man' (vir) is not used here in the sense of a husband. </p>
<p></p>
<p><b>[2]</b>
 'A virgin' in the Word means those who are in 
the Lord's kingdom, or what amounts to the same, who have the Lord's kingdom within them. This is clear in John, </p>
<blockquote>
 These are the ones who were not defiled with women, for they are virgins, these are 
the ones who follow the Lamb wherever He goes; for they are spotless before God's throne. <a href="http://bible.gospelcom.net/cgi-bin/bible?passage=Rev%2014:4,%205&amp;version=ESV&amp;interface=print&amp;showfn=yes&amp;showxref">Rev 14:4, 5</a>. 
</blockquote>
<p></p>
<p><b>[3]</b>
 Plainly, these are called 'virgins, who follow the Lamb', that is, who are in the Lord's 
kingdom; and they are also said to be 'spotless'. In the proper sense they are 'virgins' who are governed by love to the Lord - that is, who are celestial - and so who are moved by an affection for good. 
They too are called 'virgins' who are governed by charity towards the neighbour - that is, who are spiritual - and so are moved by the affection for truth, as becomes clear from the following places 
in the Word: In Isaiah, </p>
<blockquote>
She has spurned you, she has scorned you, the virgin daughter of Zion; she wags her head behind you, the daughter of Jerusalem. <a href="http://bible.gospelcom.net/cgi-bin/bible?passage=Isa%2037:22&amp;version=ESV&amp;interface=print&amp;showfn=yes&amp;showxref">Isa 37:22</a>. 
</blockquote>
<p>These words are addressed 
to the king of Asshur. 'The virgin daughter of Zion' stands for the celestial Church, 'the daughter of Jerusalem' for the spiritual Church. </p>
<p></p>
<p><b>[4]</b>
 In Jeremiah, </p>
<blockquote>
Again I will build you, and you will 
be built, O virgin of Israel! Again you will adorn yourself with your timbrels and will go forth in the dance of the merrymakers. And their life<A name="fntext1"></a><A href="#fn1"><sup>a</sup></a> will become like a watered garden, and they will not sorrow 
any more: Then will the virgin rejoice in the dance, and the young men and the old together. <a href="http://bible.gospelcom.net/cgi-bin/bible?passage=Jer%2031:4,%2012,%2013&amp;version=ESV&amp;interface=print&amp;showfn=yes&amp;showxref">Jer 31:4, 12, 13</a>. 
</blockquote>
<p>'Virgin of Israel' stands for the spiritual Church. The affection for truth which 
springs from good which exists with that Church is described here and elsewhere as 'timbrels' and 'dances'. In the same prophet, </p>
<blockquote>
The roads of Zion mourn, her priests groan, her virgins are dejected. 
The Lord has trodden the winepress for the virgin daughter of Judah See my grief - my virgins and my young men have gone into captivity. <a href="http://bible.gospelcom.net/cgi-bin/bible?passage=Lam%201:4,%2015,%2018&amp;version=ESV&amp;interface=print&amp;showfn=yes&amp;showxref">Lam 1:4, 15, 18</a>. 
</blockquote>
<p>'Virgins' stands for affections for good 
and truth. Elsewhere in the same prophet, </p>
<blockquote>
Women have been ravished in Zion, virgins in the cities of Judah. <a href="http://bible.gospelcom.net/cgi-bin/bible?passage=Lam%205:11&amp;version=ESV&amp;interface=print&amp;showfn=yes&amp;showxref">Lam 5:11</a>. 
</blockquote>
<p>'Virgins' stands for affections for good.  </p>
<p></p>
<p><b>[5]</b>
 In Amos, </p>
<blockquote>
They will 
run to and fro to seek the Word of Jehovah, and will not find it. On that day the beautiful virgins and the young men will faint for thirst. <a href="http://bible.gospelcom.net/cgi-bin/bible?passage=Amos%208:12,%2013&amp;version=ESV&amp;interface=print&amp;showfn=yes&amp;showxref">Amos 8:12, 13</a>. 
</blockquote>
<p>'The beautiful virgins' stands for affections 
for truth, 'the young men' for truths, or what amounts to the same, those with whom truths exist, of whom it is said that 'they will run to and fro to seek the Word of Jehovah, and will not find 
it', and so 'will faint for thirst'. </p>
<p></p>
<p><b>[6]</b>
 In Zechariah, </p>
<blockquote>
Jehovah their God will save them on that day; as a flock - His people. For how great is his goodness, and how great his beauty! Grain will 
make the young men flourish, and new wine the virgins. <a href="http://bible.gospelcom.net/cgi-bin/bible?passage=Zech%209:16,%2017&amp;version=ESV&amp;interface=print&amp;showfn=yes&amp;showxref">Zech 9:16, 17</a>. 
</blockquote>
<p>'The young men' stands for truths, 'the virgins' for affections. In David, </p>
<blockquote>
All glorious is the king's daughter within, in 
her clothing with gold interweavings; in embroidered robes she is led to the king. Virgins following her, her friends, have been brought to You. <a href="http://bible.gospelcom.net/cgi-bin/bible?passage=Ps%2045:13,%2014&amp;version=ESV&amp;interface=print&amp;showfn=yes&amp;showxref">Ps 45:13, 14</a>. 
</blockquote>
<p>'The king's daughter' stands for the 
Lord's spiritual kingdom. 'Virgins following her, her friends' stands for affections for truth. </p>
<p></p>
<p><b>[7]</b>
 In the same author, </p>
<blockquote>
They have seen Your goings, O God, the goings of my God in the sanctuary. 
The singers went before, players of the stringed instrument after, in the midst of the young women playing timbrels. <a href="http://bible.gospelcom.net/cgi-bin/bible?passage=Ps%2068:24,%2025&amp;version=ESV&amp;interface=print&amp;showfn=yes&amp;showxref">Ps 68:24, 25</a>. 
</blockquote>
<p>'The young women playing timbrels' also stands for affections for 
truth. But young women are distinguished from virgins by innocence, the word 'virgins' being used because of conjugial love, thus of those in whom innocence is present since conjugial love is innocence 
itself, see <a href="2736.htm">2736</a>. This explains why in the verses quoted from John they are said 'to follow the Lamb wherever He goes', for 'the Lamb' is used to mean the Lord's innocence. Furthermore all in heaven 
are called virgins from the innocence present in their good. According to the amount and particular nature of the innocence present in that good 'they follow the Lamb'.

`Virgo, et vir non cognoverat illam': quod significet purum ab omni falso, constat a significatione `virginis'; virgo in Verbo passim nominatur, et ibi per virginem significatur regnum Domini, tum quoque 
Ecclesia, et inde unusquisque qui est regnum Domini aut qui est Ecclesia, et hoc ex amore conjugiali qui in castis virginibus est; amor conjugialis in sensu spirituali est affectio boni in vero, 
et {1}affectio veri a bono, ex quibus quasi conjugio conjunctis amor conjugialis, videatur n. 2508, 2618, 2727-2729; qui quia in virgine, ut dictum, spectatur, regnum Domini, quod etiam comparatur conjugio 
et vocatur conjugium, dicitur virgo: quod `vir non cognoverit illam' significet purum ab omni falso, est quia per `virum' in Verbo non modo significatur rationale verum, sed etiam in opposito sensu 
falsum, videatur n. 265, 749, 1007, ita `cognosci a viro' est contaminari falso, et `non cognosci a viro' est purum esse a falso; per `virum' hic non intelligitur vir conjugii.  [2] Quod per `virginem' 
in Verbo significentur illi qui in regno Domini, seu quod idem, illi in quibus regnum Domini, constat apud Johannem,           Hi sunt qui cum mulieribus non polluti sunt, virgines       enim 
sunt; hi sunt qui sequuntur Agnum quo vadit,...immaculati      enim sunt coram throno Dei, Apoc. xiv 4, 5; </p>
<p>[3] manifeste illi dicuntur virgines `qui sequuntur Agnum,' hoc est, qui in regno Domini,

22; </p>
<p>ad regem Asshuris; `virgo filia Zionis' pro Ecclesia caelesti, `filia Hierosolymae' pro Ecclesia spirituali: [4] apud Jeremiam,           Adhuc aedificabo te, et aedificaberis virgo Israelis,
