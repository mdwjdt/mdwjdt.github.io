<h3 align="center" class="ired">属天的奥秘 第1268节</h3>
<h4 align="center"></h4><p><strong>1268.</strong>我在受到保护的状态下被引向那被雾笼罩的岩石。被引向这类灵人不是从一个地方被领到另一个地方，而通过灵人和天使的居间社群实现的，这个人仍呆在原来的地方；然而，他却觉得落下去了。接近那岩石时，我感到后背下面一阵寒冷。我就从那里与他们谈论他们的信念，并询问他们在肉身生活时对主是怎么想的。他们回答说，关于神，他们想了很多，但已坚信没有神存在，人类就是神，所以他们自己也是神。他们还通过梦境证实了自己的想法。下面我会讨论他们反对主的幻觉。</p>

<p><strong>[NCE]1268.</strong> I was taken toward that misty rock under safeguard. (Being led to people like these does not mean moving from place to place but staying in one place while communities of spirits and angels in between effect the change. Still, it feels like a descent.) As I drew near the crag, I came across a spot where the temperature dropped, and this chill invaded the lower part of my back. From that spot I talked with the inhabitants about their delusions, asking what beliefs concerning the Lord they had held in bodily life. They answered that they had thought about God a lot but persuaded themselves that no god could exist and that human beings were gods instead. So they considered themselves gods, they said, and their dreams confirmed them in the belief.<br />Something will be said below about the fantasies they have that express opposition to the Lord [<a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_1268/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_1270#subsection-2-3" target=_top>1270:3</a>]. </p>

I was led, guarded, toward that misty rock. (To be led to such spirits is not to be led from place to place, but it is effected by means of intermediate societies of spirits and angels, the man remaining 
in the same place; and yet it appears to him as a letting down.) As I came near the rock I was met with a coldness which gripped the lower region of my back. From there I spoke with them about their 
persuasions, and about what they had believed in the life of the body as regards the Lord. They answered that they had thought much about God, but had persuaded themselves that there is no God, but 
that men are gods, and thus they themselves were gods; and that they had confirmed themselves in these persuasions by their dreams. Their phantasies against the Lord will be spoken of below. </p>

While protected I was guided towards that mist-covered rock. (Being guided towards such spirits does not involve movement from one place to another. It is achieved by means of intervening communities 
of spirits and angels, the individual staying where he is. Nevertheless it does seem to him like a downward journey.) When I drew near that rock I met with a coldness which gripped me in the lower part 
of the back. From where I was I spoke to them about their persuasions and asked them what they had believed concerning the Lord during their lifetime. They replied that they had thought much on the 
subject of God, but had persuaded themselves that no god existed and that human beings were gods, and so they themselves were gods. They had also confirmed themselves in these ideas from dreams. Their 
delusions against the Lord's existence will be discussed below. </p>

</p><b>1268.</b>
Perductus sum et custoditus, versus petram istam nimbosam (perduci ad tales non est e loco in locum, sed fit per societates spirituum et angelorum intermedias, manente homine in eodem loco, sed usque 
apparet sicut demissio); cum prope petram istam eram, obviam factum est frigus quod inferiorem tergi regionem occupabat; inde locutus sum cum iis de persuasionibus eorum, et quid in vita corporis crediderint 
de Domino; respondebant quod cogitaverint multum de Deo, sed quod sibi persuaserint non dari aliquem deum, sed homines esse deos; sic se fuisse deos; quodque in his se confirmaverint ex somniis: 
de phantasiis eorum contra Dominum, dicetur infra. </p>
