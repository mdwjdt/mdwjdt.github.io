<h3 align="center" class="ired">属天的奥秘 第5979节</h3>
<h4 align="center"></h4><p><strong>5979.</strong>凡有信仰的人都以为只有天上的天使与他同在，系魔鬼的灵人完全从他那里被移除了。但我可以肯定地说，对一个处于爱自己爱世界的渴望和快乐，视这些为目的的人来说，魔鬼般的灵人离他如此之近，以至于就在他里面，既掌控他的思维，也掌控他的情感。天上的天使绝无可能存在于这样的思维和情感所发出的气场中，而是在它之外。正因如此，随着地狱灵越来越靠近，天使们就退离了。然而，天上的天使决不会完全离开人，否则，他就全完了。因为他若不通过天使与天堂相接触，就无法存活。</p>

A man who is in faith believes that none but angels from heaven are with him, and that diabolical spirits are altogether removed from him. But I can assert that in the case of a man who is in the concupiscences 
and delights of the love of self and of the world, and regards these as the end, diabolical spirits are so near him as to be in him, and to rule both his thoughts and his affections. Angels 
from heaven cannot possibly be within the sphere of such, but are without; and therefore the angels recede as the infernal spirits approach nearer. Nevertheless the angels from heaven in no case recede 
altogether from a man, for then all would be over with him, because if he should be without communication with heaven by means of angels, he could not live. [2] That there are infernal spirits and 
heavenly angels with man is also in some measure taught by the doctrine of faith of Christian Churches; for this declares that all good is from God, and that evil is from the devil; and preachers confirm 
this by their prayers in the pulpit that God may direct their thoughts and their words, and by their saying that in justification all endeavors, even the least, are from God; and also that when 
a man lives well he suffers himself to be led by God; and likewise that angels are sent by God to minister to man. And on the other hand, when a man has committed any enormous evil, they say he has suffered 
himself to be led by the devil, and that such evil is from hell. They would also have said that spirits from hell were flowing into the interior evils which are of the will and the thought, if 
they had acknowledged these evils to be so great. </p>

Anyone who is a believer thinks that none but angels from heaven are present with him and that spirits who are devils have been totally removed from him. But I can positively declare that in the case 
of someone in whom the yearnings and delights belonging to self-love and love of the world exist and are his end in view, those spirits are present and so close to him that they are in him, controlling 
both his thoughts and his affections. Angels from heaven cannot possibly be present within a sphere emanating from such thoughts and affections, only outside it. This being so, the angels depart as 
hellish spirits come nearer. Yet the angels from heaven never depart completely from a person, for if they did he would be done for. Left without his contact with heaven through the angels he could not 
live. </p>
<p></p>
<p><b>[2]</b>
 The truth that spirits from hell and angels from heaven are present with a person is also in some measure contained in the faith taught by Christian Churches. For their teachings state 
that all good comes from God, and that evil comes from the devil; and preachers reinforce it by their pulpit prayer that God may control their thoughts and words, and by their assertion that with the 
righteous all things, even the least of their endeavours, begin in God. Those preachers also say that when a person leads a good life he allows himself to be led by God, and in addition that angels are 
sent from God to help him; or they will say, when someone has performed an extremely evil deed, that he has allowed himself to be led by the devil and that any evil like that comes from hell. They 
would also have said that spirits from hell were flowing into the interior evils belonging to the person's thought and will, if they had recognized those evils to be just as great. </p>

Homo qui in fide est, credit quod non nisi quam angeli e caelo apud ipsum sint, et quod diabolici spiritus ab illo prorsus remoti{1}; sed asseverare possum quod apud hominem qui est in concupiscentiis 
et jucundis amoris sui et mundi, et haec illi pro fine sunt, tam prope apud illum sint ut sint in ipso et regant ejus tam cogitationes quam affectiones; angeli {2}e caelo nequaquam possunt intra sphaeram 
talium esse sed extra, quapropter etiam angeli recedunt sicut spiritus infernales propius accedunt; at usque angeli e caelo nusquam prorsus ab homine {3}recedunt, tunc enim actum foret cum illo; 
nam si absque communicatione cum caelo per angelos foret, non potuisset vivere. [2] Quod spiritus infernales et angeli caelestes apud hominem sint, etiam quodammodo ex doctrina fidei Ecclesiarum Christianarum 
est; dictat enim doctrina quod omne bonum a Deo, et quod malum a diabolo; et confirmant hoc praedicatores per id quod {4}in pulpitis orent ut Deus regat eorum cogitata et eorum verba, {5}quodque 
dicant quod in justificatione omnia usque ad {6}minima conatuum a Deo sint; tum quando homo bene vivit, quod se duci patiatur a Deo; et quoque quod angeli {7}mittantur a Deo, qui homini {8}inserviant; 
ac vicissim cum homo {9}aliquod enorme malum fecerat, {10}dicunt illum se a diabolo passum esse {11}duci, et quod tale malum ab inferno sit; {12}dixissent etiam quod spiritus ab (m)inferno {13} 
influerent in mala interiora quae sunt voluntatis et cogitationis, si haec 1{14}mala pro tantis agnovissent.(n) @1 i sint$ @2 in$ @3 removentur$ @4 supplicent$ @5 et$ @6 minimos conatus$ @7 sint$ @8
