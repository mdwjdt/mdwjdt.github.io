<h3 align="center" class="ired">属天的奥秘 第6717节</h3>
<h4 align="center"></h4><p><strong>6717.</strong>“娶了一个利未的女子”表与良善结合。这从“娶了一个女子”的含义和“利未”的代表清楚可知：“娶了一个女子”（即娶为妻）是指结合；“利未”是指良善（参看<a href="6716.htm">6716</a>节）。有必要说明当如何理解“源于良善的真理与良善结合”这个观念。主灌输给一个正在重生之人的真理，其起源可追溯到良善。起初，良善并未显明自己，因为它在内在人中；而真理则显明自己，因为它在外在人中；由于内在作用于外在，反过来不行（<a href="6322.htm">6322</a>节），故是良善作用于真理，并使这真理成为它自己的，因为只有良善才承认并接受真理。这一点从存在于正在重生之人里面的对真理的情感变得显而易见。这种情感本身源于良善，因为情感作为爱的标志，不可能来自其它任何源头。但在这初始阶段，也就是重生之前所接受的这真理并非真正的良善之真理，而是教义的真理。事实上，在这个阶段，人没有考虑它是不是真理，而是承认、接受它，因为它是教会教义的一部分。只要他不考虑它是不是真理，并出于这种考虑承认、接受它，它就是他自己的，因而不会归与他。这就是正在重生之人的第一个状态。<br />但是，一旦他重生，那么良善就会显明自己，尤其通过他喜欢照着他自愿承认为真理的真理生活来显明。这时，由于他意愿他所承认、接受的真理，并照之行事，所以它就归与他，成了他自己的。这是因为它不再像以前一样只在他的理解力中，还在他的意愿中，只有意愿里的东西才能归与他，成为他自己的。由于这时理解力与意愿合而为一，即理解力承认、接受，意愿则执行，付诸实践，所以才会有这二者的一个结合，也就是良善与真理的结合。一旦实现这种结合，那么后代就如同从一个婚姻中那样不断出生，这后代就是真理与良善，以及伴随它们的一切祝福和快乐。这两种状态就是源于良善的真理和与良善结合的真理所表示的。<br />但是，此处由“有一个来自利未家的人，去娶了一个利未的女子”所表示的与良善结合的真理，并不是人在第一个状态所接受的那种真理；因为那时他所接受的东西是他生在其中的教会所教导的教义之真理。确切地说，它是真正的真理本身，因为至高意义上所论述的主题是主，即祂的人身如何变成神的律法；体现在该律法中的真理就是真理本身所所表示的。这种真理之所以源于良善，是因为正是神性，即主的至内在自我和祂生命的存在，在祂的人身中产生这真理。真理就这样与良善结合，因为神性无非是良善。</p>

And took a daughter of Levi. That this signifies conjunction with good, is evident from the signification of "taking a daughter" (that is, to wife), as being conjunction; and from the representation 
of Levi, as being good (see n. 6716). How it is to be understood that the truth whose origin is from good, is conjoined with good, shall be told. The truth which is instilled by the Lord in the man who 
is being regenerated, has its origin from good. In the first period the good does not show itself, because it is in the internal man, but the truth shows itself, because it is in the external man; and 
as the internal acts into the external, and not the converse (n. 6322), it is good which acts into truth, and makes this its own, for nothing else than good acknowledges and receives truth. This is 
apparent from the affection of truth that is present in the man who is being regenerated. The affection itself is from good, for an affection which is of love cannot come from any other source. But this 
truth which is received in this first period, that is, before regeneration, is not the genuine truth of good, but it is the truth of doctrine. For at this time the man does not consider whether it 
is truth, but acknowledges it because it is of the doctrine of the church; and so long as he does not consider whether it is truth, and from this acknowledges it, it is not his, and therefore is not 
appropriated to him. This is the first state with the man who is being regenerated. [2] But when he has been regenerated, then good shows itself, especially by his loving to live according to the truth 
which he of himself acknowledges to be truth. Then because he wills the truth which he acknowledges, and acts according to it, it is appropriated to him; because it is not as before merely in the understanding, 
but is also in the will, and what is in the will is appropriated. And as the understanding then makes one with the will, for the understanding acknowledges and the will performs, there is 
a conjunction of the two, namely, of good and truth. When this conjunction has been effected, then as from a marriage, offspring are continually born, which are truths and goods with their blessednesses 
and delights. These two states are what are meant by the origin of truth from good, and by their conjunction. [3] But the truth which is being conjoined with good, which is here signified by "there 
went a man from the house of Levi and took a daughter of Levi," is not such truth as is received by a man in the first state, for this is the truth of the doctrine of that church in which he has been 
born; but it is the very truth itself; for the subject treated of in the supreme sense is the Lord, how He became the law Divine as to the Human; and the truth of this law is what is meant. That its 
origin is good, is because the Divine, which was the Lord's inmost and the esse of His life, brought it forth in His Human. Thus was conjunction effected of this truth with good; for the Divine is 
nothing else than good. </p>

<p align="center"><b>Elliott(1983-1999) 6717</b></p><p><b>6717.</b>
'And married a daughter of Levi' means its being joined to good. This is clear from the meaning of 'marrying a daughter' as a joining together; and from the representation of 'Levi' as good, dealt with 
immediately above in <a href="6716.htm">6716</a>. How to understand the idea that truth which had its origin in good was joined to good must be stated. The truth that is instilled by the Lord into a person who is being regenerated 
traces its origin back to good. Initially good does not reveal itself because it is in the internal man; but truth does reveal itself because it is in the external and because the internal 
acts on the external, and not vice versa, <a href="6322.htm">6322</a>. Good is that which acts on truth and makes it its own, since nothing else than good acknowledges and receives truth. This becomes apparent in the affection 
for truth that is present with a person who is being regenerated. The affection derives from the good, for an affection that is a mark of love cannot come from any other source. But this truth that 
is received at this initial stage, that is, before regeneration, is not the genuine truth of good; rather, it is the truth of doctrine. For at this stage a person does not ponder on whether it is the 
truth but accepts it because it is part of the teaching of the Church. And as long as he does not ponder on whether it is the truth and then accept it, it is neither his own nor thereby comes to be 
his own. This state is the first for a person who is being regenerated. </p>
<p></p>
<p><b>[2]</b>
 But once he has been regenerated the good reveals itself, in particular through the fact that he loves to lead his life in 
accordance with the truth which of his own accord he acknowledges to be the truth. At this point because he wills and acts on the truth he accepts, it comes to be his own. The reason for this is that 
it is not merely in his understanding, as it was previously, but is also in his will; and what is in the will has come to be his own. And since the understanding now makes one with the will - for the 
understanding accepts and the will puts into practice - there is a joining together of the two, that is to say, of good and truth. Once the joining together has been effected, then as if from a marriage 
offspring are born repeatedly, such offspring being truths and forms of good, and all the blessing and delight that accompanies them. These two states are what are meant by truth that has its origin 
in good and by truth joined to good. </p>
<p></p>
<p><b>[3]</b>
 But the truth that is joined to good, meant here by 'a man from the house of Levi went and married a daughter of Levi', is not the kind of truth that a 
person receives in the first state; for what he receives then is the truth of doctrine taught by the Church in which he was born. Rather, it is truth itself, for the subject in the highest sense is the 
way in which the Lord as to His Human became the law of God, the truth embodied in this law being what is meant by truth itself. The reason why the origin of such truth is good is that it was the Divine 
- what was the Lord's inmost Self and the Being (Esse) of His life - that gave rise to that truth in His Human. This was how that truth came to be joined to good, for the Divine is nothing other 
than good. </p>

`Et duxit filiam Levi': quod significet conjunctionem cum bono, constat ex significatione `ducere filiam,' nempe in uxorem, quod sit conjunctio; et ex repraesentatione `Levi' quod sit bonum, de qua 
mox supra n. 6716.  Quomodo intelligendum est quod verum, cujus origo ex bono, conjunctum sit cum bono, dicendum: verum quod a Domino insinuatur apud hominem qui regeneratur originem trahit ex bono; bonum 
{1}primo tempore se non manifestat quia est in interno homine, verum autem se manifestat quia est in externo, et quia internum agit in externum, et non vice versa, n. 6322; est bonum quod agit in 
verum et hoc suum facit, nam non aliud agnoscit et recipit verum quam bonum; hoc apparet ex affectione veri quae est apud hominem qui regeneratur; ipsa affectio est ex bono, aliunde affectio quae est 
amoris non venire potest; sed hoc verum quod primo hoc tempore, hoc est, ante regenerationem, recipitur, non est verum {2}genuinum boni, sed est verum doctrinae; nam homo tunc non expendit num verum 
sit, sed agnoscit quia est doctrinae Ecclesiae; et quamdiu non expendit num verum sit, et inde agnoscit, suum non est, quare nec ei appropriatur; hic status (t)est primus homini qui 2 regeneratur; at 
cum regeneratus est, tunc bonum se manifestat, imprimis per id quod amet vivere secundum verum quod a se agnoscit esse verum; tunc quia vult verum quod {3}agnoscit, et agit secundum id, appropriatur ei; 
quia est, non ut prius modo in intellectu, sed etiam in voluntate, et quod in voluntate est, hoc appropriatum est; et quia tunc intellectus unum {4}facit cum voluntate, nam intellectus agnoscit et 
voluntas facit, est conjunctio utriusque, nempe boni et veri; cum haec conjunctio facta est, tunc sicut ex conjugio, nascuntur continue proles, quae sunt vera et bona cum eorum beatis et jucundis.  Hi 
bini status sunt qui intelliguntur per originem veri ex bono et per conjunctionem eorum. 	3 Sed {5}verum quod conjungitur cum bono, quod hic significatur per `ivit vir e domo Levi et duxit filiam Levi,' 
non est tale verum quod {6}ab homine in primo statu {7}recipitur, nam id est verum doctrinae illius Ecclesiae in qua natus est, sed est ipsum verum, nam agitur in supremo sensu de Domino quomodo 
Ipse lex Divina quoad Humanum factus est, hujus legis verum est quod intelligitur; quod ejus origo sit bonum, est quia {8}Divinum, quod fuit intimum Domini ac Esse vitae Ipsius, produxit id in Humano 
Ipsius; ita veri illius conjunctio facta est cum bono, nam Divinum non est nisi quam bonum. 	@1 tunc$ 	@2 genuini$ 	@3 credit$ 	@4 agit$ 	@5 hic per verum non intelligitur$ 	@6 apud hominem$ 	@7
