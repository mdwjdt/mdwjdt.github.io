<h3 align="center" class="ired">属天的奥秘 第8816节</h3>
<h4 align="center"></h4><p><strong>8816.</strong>“营中的百姓尽都发颤”表就那些即将接受之人而言的一种神圣震颤。这从“发颤”和“营中百姓”的含义清楚可知：“发颤”是指一种神圣的震颤；“营中百姓”是指那些即将接受神性真理的人。圣言各处说到，当耶和华降临时，“大地震动，诸山熔化”（如诗篇<a href="http://39-27.cn/诗77.17.htm">77:17</a>，<a href="http://39-27.cn/诗77.18.htm">18</a>；<a href="http://39-27.cn/诗97.4.htm">97:4</a>，<a href="http://39-27.cn/诗97.5.htm">5</a>；<a href="http://39-27.cn/诗104.32.htm">104:32</a>等）；以此表示在神性面前，一切事物的剧烈震动；因为神性具有这样的性质：没有人能承受祂的同在，除非他在一种云中，因而适合接受祂。事实上，神性就像太阳里的火；这火若真的赤裸裸地落在人们身上，就会瞬间吞灭他们。但对祂的接受取决于与各人同在的良善。那些处于良善的人的确在神性面前颤抖，但这是一种在接受之前到来的神圣颤抖。然而，那些陷入邪恶的人则在神性面前感到恐惧，并因此逃之夭夭；这时，他们被自己的虚假包围，仿佛被乌云笼罩，并被隐藏起来。那时他们所去往的岩石洞穴就表示这些虚假。由此可见“营中的百姓尽都发颤”表示什么。</p>

<p align="center"><b>Potts(1905-1910) 8816</b></p><p><b>8816.</b>
And all the people that were in the camp trembled. That this signifies a holy tremor on the part of those who were about to receive, is evident from the signification of "trembling," as being a holy 
tremor; and from the signification of "the people that were in the camp," as being those who were about to receive the Divine truth. It is said in the Word in various places that when Jehovah comes down, 
"the earth trembles, and the mountains melt" (as in Ps. 77:17, 18; 97:4, 5; 104:32, and elsewhere); whereby is signified the commotion of all at the presence of the Divine; for the Divine is such 
that no one can endure it unless he is in a kind of cloud, and thus is accommodated to its reception; for it is like the fire which is in the sun, which if it were to fall naked on anyone, would consume 
him in a moment. But the reception is according to the good with each person. They who are in good do indeed tremble at the presence of the Divine, but it is a holy tremor which precedes reception. 
But they who are in evil are in terror at the presence of the Divine, and therefore flee away, and are then enveloped in their falsities as in a dusky cloud, and are hidden. These things are signified 
by the "caves of the rocks" into which they then betake themselves. From all this it can be seen what is signified by "all the people that were in the camp trembled." </p>

<p align="center"><b>Elliott(1983-1999) 8816</b></p><p><b>8816.</b>
'And all the people who were in the camp trembled' means a holy quivering by those about to receive. This is clear from the meaning of 'trembling' as a holy quivering; and from the meaning of 'the people 
who were in the camp' as those about to receive Divine Truth Various places in the Word say that when Jehovah comes down the earth quakes and mountains collapse, as in <a href="http://bible.gospelcom.net/cgi-bin/bible?passage=Ps%2077:17,%2018;%2097:4,%205;%20104:32&amp;version=ESV&amp;interface=print&amp;showfn=yes&amp;showxref">Ps 77:17, 18; 97:4, 5; 104:32</a>; 
and elsewhere By this the violent shaking of all things at the presence of the Divine is meant; for the Divine is such that no person can bear His presence unless he is in a kind of cloud and so 
in a suitable condition to receive Him The Divine is like the fire within the sun; if this were to fall naked on people it would instantly devour them. But reception of Him depends on how far good exists 
with someone. Those governed by good do indeed start to quiver at the presence of the Divine; but it is a holy quivering that comes before reception. Those however who are ruled by evil are terrified 
at the presence of the Divine and therefore flee, at which time they are enveloped by their falsities as if by a dark cloud, and are hidden. These falsities are meant by the caves in the rocks they 
then take themselves into From all this one may see what 'all the people who were in the camp trembled' means. </p>

<p align="center"><b>Latin(1748-1756) 8816</b>
</p><b>8816.</b>
`Et trepidabat omnis populus qui in castris': quod significet sanctum tremorem illis qui recepturi, constat ex significatione `trepidare' quod sit sanctus tremor, et ex significatione `populi qui in 
castris' quod sint qui Divinum Verum recepturi.  In Verbo passim dicitur quod cum descendit Jehovah, contremiscat terra, et diffluant montes, ut Ps. lxxvii 18, 19 [A.V. 17, 18]; Ps. xcvii 4, 5; Ps. civ 
32, et alibi, et per id significatur commotio omnium ad praesentiam Divini, nam Divinum tale est ut nemo sustineat nisi in quadam nube sit, et sic accommodatus receptioni, est enim sicut ignis qui 
in sole, qui si nudus incideret, momento consumeret; sed {1}receptio se habet secundum bonum apud unumquemvis; qui in bono sunt ad praesentiam Divini quidem contremiscunt, sed est tremor sanctus qui praecedit 
receptionem; at qui in malo sunt ad praesentiam Divini in terrore sunt, ac ideo aufugiunt, et tunc involvuntur falsis suis sicut furva nube, et absconduntur; haec significantur per cavernas petrarum 
in quas tunc se {2}recipiunt; ex his constare potest quid per `trepidabat omnis populus qui in castris' significatur. @1 illa se habent$ @2 conjiciunt$ </p>
