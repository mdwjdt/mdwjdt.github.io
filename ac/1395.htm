<h3 align="center" class="ired">属天的奥秘 第1395节</h3>
<h4 align="center"></h4><p><strong>1395.</strong>关于这种直觉，我通过经验了解很多，但讲述这一切会占用大量篇幅。我经常听骗子们说话，不仅察觉出欺骗的存在，还察觉出它们的性质，以及它隐含何种恶毒。可以说，他们每一个声调中都有一个欺骗的形像。我还能发觉这种欺骗是属于说话的这个灵人，还是属于通过他说话的其他灵人。那些心怀仇恨之人也一样：仇恨的性质能立刻被察觉出来。无论如何被引导，谁都想象不出它里面包含多少东西。当他们所憎恨的人被带到他们面前时，一种可悲的状态就会突然临到这些心怀这种仇恨之人身上；因为他们所思想和密谋攻击别人的一切阴谋诡计都会暴露无遗。<br />

<p><strong>[NCE]1395.</strong> A wealth of experience has taught me how this kind of perception works, but recounting all of it would take too long.<br />Many times I have heard swindlers talking and perceived not only the presence of fraud but also its nature and the nature of the malice behind it. It is as if an image of their duplicity dwells in every sound they utter. In addition, I have perceived whether the fraud was invented by the speaker or by others talking through the speaker.<br />It is the same with people who hate. One can see right away the character of their hatred and the factors that go into it, which are more numerous than you could ever be persuaded to believe. When the victims of their hatred are present in person, it creates a pitiable situation for the haters, since whatever thoughts they had entertained or plots they had hatched against the person stand out in plain view. </p>

As regards this kind of perception, I have learned many things from experience, but it would be tedious to relate them all. Often have I heard the deceitful speaking, and have perceived not only that 
there was deceit, but also what the deceit was, and what special wickedness there was in it. There is as it were an image of the deceit in every tone of the voice. I could also perceive whether the deceit 
belonged to him who was speaking, or to others who spoke through him. The case is similar with those who are in hatred: the nature of the hatred is at once perceived, and more things that are in 
it than man can in any wise be induced to believe. When the persons are presented against whom the hatred has been felt, a lamentable state results, for whatever had been thought and plotted against 
them stands forth to view. </p>

As regards this kind of perception, I have been enabled to know it from much experience, though it would take up too much space to relate everything. Quite a number of times I have heard deceivers speaking, 
and have perceived not only the existence of the deception but also the nature of it and what wickedness lay within it. There is in every tone of their voice, so to speak, the image of deception. 
I have also perceived whether the deception was the spirit's own, or that of others who spoke through him. It is similar with those who harbor hatred; the nature of the hatred is detected in an instant, 
and more things within it than anyone could possibly have been led to believe. When persons whom they have hated are brought into their presence, a pitiable state then overtakes those who have 
harbored such hatred; for whatever they have thought or plotted against anyone else comes out into the open. </p>

<p align="center"><b>Latin(1748-1756) 1395</b>
</p><b>1395.</b>
Quomodo perceptionis hujus genus se habet, multa ab experientia datum est scire, quae omnia prolixum nimis foret referre: auditum pluries cum dolosi locuti, et perceptum non solum quod dolus, sed etiam 
quali dolus, et quae malitia in dolo; est quasi in quolibet sono vocis imago doli; tum etiam perceptum num dolus fuerit ejus, vel aliorum qui per eum locuti: similiter se habet cum illis qui in odio 
sunt; appercipitur ilico quale odium et plura quam usquam homo potest induci credere, quae in odio: cum sistuntur personae praesentes, contra quos odium habuerunt, inde fit statu lamentabilis, nam quicquid 
contra alterum cogitaverunt et machinati sunt exstat. </p>
