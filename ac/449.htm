<h4 align="center"></h4><p><h4 align="center">五、创世记第五章</h4><br />关于天堂与天堂之乐（一）<br /><br /><strong>449.</strong>迄今为止，没人知道何为天堂与天堂之乐。而思考过它们的人所形成的观念又如此笼统和粗俗，以至等同于对它们根本没有任何概念。从刚刚由尘世进入灵界的精灵那里，我能准确获知世人在这方面所持有的观点；对他们自己而言，仿佛他们仍活在人世，其思维模式和在世时的一模一样。我举几个例子。</p>

Those who have considered either subject have formed such a crude, generalized picture that it is hardly any picture at all.<br />Spirits who have only recently come into the next life from the world have allowed me to see with perfect clarity what idea of heaven and heavenly joy they had formed. When left to their own devices as if they were still in the world, you see, they think the same way they did there. Let me offer just a few examples. </p>

CHAPTER 5 CONCERNING HEAVEN AND HEAVENLY JOY Hitherto the nature of heaven and of heavenly joy has been known to none. Those who have thought about them have formed an idea concerning them so general 
and so gross as scarcely to amount to any idea at all. What notion they have conceived on the subject I have been able to learn most accurately from spirits who had recently passed from the world into 
the other life; for when left to themselves, as if they were in this world, they think in the same way. I may give a few examples. </p>

HEAVEN AND HEAVENLY JOY  Up to now nobody has known what heaven and heavenly joy are. People who have thought about either of them have conceived so general and so crude an idea as to be scarcely any 
idea at all. From spirits who have recently arrived in the next life from the world I have been enabled to know perfectly well what sort of notion they had conceived about heaven and heavenly joy. For 
when left to themselves, as if they were still living in the world, they go on thinking as they have done before. Let just a few examples be presented.  </p>

GENESEOS                           CAPUT QUINTUM                    De Caelo et Gaudio caelesti </p>
<p>QUID caelum et gaudium caeleste, nemo adhuc novit; qui de illo et de hoc cogitarunt, 
tam communem et tam crassam ideam conceperunt ut vix sit aliqua.  Ex spiritibus qui recens e mundo in alteram vitam veniunt, optime scire potui qualem de caelo et de gaudio caelesti conceperunt 
notionem nam relicti sibi sicut forent in mundo, cogitant similiter: aliqua solum exempla licet afferre. </p>
