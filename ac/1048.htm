<h3 align="center" class="ired">属天的奥秘 第1048节</h3>
<h4 align="center"></h4><p><strong>1048.</strong>“必有彩虹现在云彩中”表人还能重生的时候。这一点从“云中彩虹”的含义明显可知，它是重生的记号或标志，如前所述。关于云中的彩虹，我还要多说几句：肉体死亡后，一个人，或灵魂的品性立刻就被得知。主自永恒就知道这品性，并知道它到永恒时是何样子。人一靠近，天使就能觉察他的品性。可以说，有一种气场从他的整个秉性，即从他的每一个部分放射出来。说来奇妙，这个气场具有这样的特点，即人通过它可觉察这个人具有什么样的信和仁。若主乐意，这气场会显现为一道彩虹。关于这个气场，蒙主慈悲，容后再述。由此清楚可知此处“彩虹现在云彩中”所表之义，即人尚能重生之时。</p>

<p><strong>[NCE]1048.</strong> That a bow will be seen in the cloud means when we are nevertheless the kind of people who can be reborn. This is established by the symbolism of a bow in the cloud, which, again, is a sign and indication of rebirth [<a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_1048/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_1042" target=_top>1042</a>].<br />To speak further of a bow in the cloud: The character of a person, or of a soul after death, is recognized immediately. The Lord has known it from eternity, and he knows what it will be to eternity. Angels instantly perceive what we are like the moment we first approach them. There is a kind of aura that emanates from our disposition, so to speak, or from the individual traits in us. This aura, amazingly enough, is such that another can tell from it what our beliefs are and what kind of love we have for others. The aura is what becomes visible in the form of a rainbow, when the Lord so pleases.{*1} This aura will be discussed again later, the Lord in his divine mercy willing [<a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_1048/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_1383" target=_top>1383-1400</a>, <a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_1048/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_1504" target=_top>1504-1520</a>].<br />This shows what the time when a bow is seen in the cloud means: when we are the kind of people who can be reborn.<br /><br /><strong>Footnotes:</strong><br />{*1} This phenomenon of a rainbow aura is described in <a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_1048/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_1043" target=_top>1043</a>.

That the bow shall be seen in the cloud. That this signifies when man is still such that he can be regenerated, is evident from the signification of the "bow in the cloud" which is a sign or indication 
of regeneration, as said above. With regard to the bow in the cloud, the case further is this. The quality of a man, or of a soul after the death of the body, is known at once; by the Lord it is known 
from eternity, and what it will be to eternity. By the angels his quality is perceived the moment he comes near. There is a certain sphere which exhales-so to speak-from his nature, or from everything 
in him; and this sphere, wonderful to say, is such that from it is perceived in what faith and in what charity the man is. It is this sphere that becomes visible as a bow when it so pleases the Lord. 
(Concerning this sphere, of the Lord's Divine mercy hereafter.) Hence it is evident what is here signified by the bow when seen in the cloud, namely, when man is such that he can be regenerated. </p>

<p align="center"><b>Elliott(1983-1999) 1048</b></p><p><b>1048.</b>
'And the bow is seen in the cloud' means when man is still such as to be able to be regenerated. This is clear from the meaning of 'the bow in the cloud' which is a sign or token of regeneration, as 
stated already. Concerning the bow in the cloud there is more to be said: The character of a person, that is, of a soul, after the body has died is known in an instant. The Lord has known that character 
from eternity, and knows what it is going to be into eternity. A person's character is perceived by angels the moment he comes near; a certain sphere so to speak emanates from his whole disposition, 
that is, from every part of him. And this sphere, astonishing though it may seem, is such that from it one perceives what faith and what charity exist with him from whom it emanates. When it pleases 
the Lord it is that sphere which is made visible as a bow. This sphere will in the Lord's Divine mercy be described later on. From this it becomes clear what is meant here by 'the bow when it is seen 
in the cloud', namely when a person is such that he can be regenerated. </p>

<p align="center"><b>Latin(1748-1756) 1048</b>
</p><b>1048.</b>
'Et videtur arcus in nube': quod significet quando usque homo talis est ut regenerari queat, constat a significatione 'arcus in nube' qui est signum seu indicium regenerationis, ut prius est dictum; 
cum arcu in nube ita porro se habet: homo seu anima post mortem corporis, qualis est, ilico noscitur a 'Domino ab aeterno, et qualis futura in aeternum; ab angelis percipitur ilico ad primum adventum 
qualis est; est sphaera quaedam quae quasi exhalat ab indole ejus seu a singulis quae apud eum, quae sphaera, quod mirabile, talis est ut inde percipiatur qua fide sit, qua charitate; haec sphaera est 
quae cum Domino ita beneplacet, fit visualis per arcum; de qua sphaera, ex Divina Domini Misericordia, iri sequentibus: inde constare potest quid significatur hic per 'arcum cum videtur in nube,' quod 
nempe cum homo talis est ut regenerari queat. </p>
