<h3 align="center" class="ired">属天的奥秘 第5957节</h3>
<h4 align="center"></h4><p><strong>5957.</strong>“送给他父亲的如下”表白白赐给属灵良善的东西。这从以色列的代表和“送”的含义清楚可知：以色列，即此处的“父亲”是指来自属世层的属灵良善（参看<a href="5801.htm">5801</a>，<a href="5803.htm">5803</a>，<a href="5807.htm">5807</a>，<a href="5812.htm">5812</a>，<a href="5817.htm">5817</a>，<a href="5819.htm">5819</a>，<a href="5826.htm">5826</a>，<a href="5833.htm">5833</a>节）；“送”是指白白赐给。事实上，从主经由内在流入外在的一切事物（这些事物甚至流入属灵良善，即“以色列”，因为该良善来自属世层）都被白白地赐予。诚然，主要求人谦卑、敬拜、感恩，以及其它许多事，这些看上去就像回报，以致祂的恩赐似乎不是无偿的。但是，主要求这些东西不是为祂自己，因为神性不会从人的谦卑、敬拜和感恩中得荣耀。任何自我之爱存在于神性中，使得祂为了自己而要求这类行为，这是完全不可想象的。相反，主要求它们是为了人；因为人若拥有谦卑，就能从主接受良善；在这种情况下，他就会与阻碍他接受这良善的自我之爱及其邪恶分开。因此，主想要的是为了人而在人里面的谦卑状态，因为当他处于这种状态时，主就能以天上的良善流入。敬拜和感恩也是如此。</p>

And to his father he sent after this manner. That this signifies what was given gratuitously to spiritual good, is evident from the representation of Israel, who is here the "father," as being spiritual 
good from the natural (see n. 5801, 5803, 5807, 5812, 5817, 5819, 5826, 5833); and from the signification of "sending," as being to give gratuitously. For everything that flows in from the Lord through 
the internal into the external, or into the natural (even what flows into spiritual good, which is "Israel," because this good is from the natural), is given gratuitously. The Lord does indeed demand 
humiliation, adoration, thanksgivings, and many other things from man, which appear like repayings, and thus not gratuitous; but the Lord does not demand these things for His own sake, for the Divine 
has no glory from man's humiliation, adoration, and thanksgiving. In the Divine, anything of the love of self is utterly inconceivable-that such things should be done for His own sake; but they 
are for the sake of the man himself; for when a man is in humiliation he can receive good from the Lord, because he has then been separated from the love of self and its evils, which are the obstacle; 
and therefore the Lord wills a state of humiliation in man for his own sake; because when he is in this state the Lord can flow in with heavenly good. The case is similar with adoration, and with thanksgiving. </p>

'And to his father he sent as follows' means what was freely given to spiritual good. This is clear from the representation of Israel, to whom 'father' refers here, as spiritual good from the natural, 
as in <a href="5801.htm">5801</a>, <a href="5803.htm">5803</a>, <a href="5806.htm">5806</a>, <a href="5812.htm">5812</a>, <a href="5817.htm">5817</a>, <a href="5819.htm">5819</a>, <a href="5826.htm">5826</a>, <a href="5833.htm">5833</a>; and from the meaning of 'sending' as freely giving. For everything that flows from the Lord by way of the internal into the external or natural 
- even into spiritual good, which is 'Israel', since it derives from the natural - is freely given. The Lord does, it is true, demand humility, worship, thanksgiving, and much else from a person, which 
seem like repayment, so that His gifts do not seem to be free. But the Lord does not demand those things for His own sake, for the Divine derives no glory at all from a person's humility, worship, or 
thanksgiving. It is utterly inconceivable that any self-love should exist within the Divine, causing Him to require such actions for His own sake. Rather, they are required for man's own sake, for if 
someone possesses humility he is able to accept good from the Lord, since in that case he has been parted from self-love and its evils which stand in the way of his accepting it. Therefore the Lord 
desires a state of humility in a person for that person's sake, because the Lord can flow in with heavenly good when that state exists in him. The same applies to worship and thanksgiving. </p>

`Et patri suo misit ut hoc': quod significet quid gratis   donatum bono spirituali{1}, constat ex repraesentatione `Israelis' qui hic `pater', quod sit bonum spirituale e naturali, ut n. 5801, 5803, 
5806, 5812, 5817, 5819, 5826, 5833; et ex significatione `mittere' quod sit gratis donare; omne enim quod per internum influit a Domino in externum seu in naturale, {2}etiam quod in bonum spirituale 
quod Israel, quia hoc est e naturali, gratis donatur; postulat quidem Dominus humiliationem, adorationem, gratiarum actiones, et plura ab homine, quae apparent sicut remunerationes, ac ita non gratis; 
sed Dominus non postulat illa Sui causa, nam nihil gloriae Divino ex humiliatione, adoratione, et gratiarum actione hominis; in Divino  prorsus non conceptibile est aliquid amoris sui ut propter Se talia 
fiant, verum sunt propter ipsum hominem, cum enim homo in humiliatione est, tunc potest recipere bonum a Domino, nam tunc separatus est ab amore sui et ejus malis quae obstant; quapropter  Dominus 
humiliationis statum apud hominem vult ejus causa, {3}quia cum homo in illo statu est, potest Dominus influere cum bono caelesti; similiter se habet cum adoratione et cum gratiarum actione.   @1 i
