<h3 align="center" class="ired">属天的奥秘 第41节</h3>
<h4 align="center"></h4><p><strong>41.</strong>凡属于人的本不具生命，显为相时，看似一块坚硬的黑物。反之，凡出于主的皆具足生命，内含属灵属天之性，显为相时，看似有生命和人性之物。天使的每句话、每个意象、每个念头，皆具有活力，内含生命之主所发的情感，这听起来不可思议，却千真万确。凡出于主的皆内有生命，因为它包含对主的信，故以“活物”为象征。另外，它们皆具有相应的形体，以“能行动”为象征。对人而言，这些尚是隐藏的奥秘，今稍作提及，因此处谈到了“能行动的活物”。</p>

<p><strong>[NCE]41.</strong> Nothing that is a person's very own has any life in it. When presented to view, it looks hard as bone, and black. Everything that comes from the Lord, on the other hand, has life. It has a spiritual and heavenly quality and looks like something living and human.{*1} Incredibly, perhaps (although it is absolutely true), each word, each mental image, and each scintilla of thought in an angelic spirit is alive. Passion received from the Lord, who is life itself, permeates every single thing about such a spirit.<br />Things that come from the Lord, then, contain life because they contain faith in him, and they are symbolized here by a living soul. Additionally, they have the equivalent of a physical body, symbolized by that which moves or creeps. This information remains obscure to the human mind, but since the verse talks about a living soul that moves, I need at least to mention it.<br /><br /><strong>Footnotes:</strong><br />{*1} Abstract qualities, according to Swedenborg, become visible as objects in the next life. See <a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_41/swedenborg_heaven-and-hell-dole_173" target=_top>Heaven and Hell 173-176</a>, where by way of illustration he mentions the appearance of beautiful tree groves and gardens in the vicinity of angels who are especially intelligent.

Whatever is proper to man has no life in itself, and whenever it is made manifest to the sight it appears hard, like a bony and black substance; but whatever is from the Lord has life, containing within 
it that which is spiritual and celestial, which when presented to view appears human and living. It may seem incredible but is nevertheless most true, that every single expression, every single idea, 
and every least of thought in an angelic spirit, is alive, containing in its minutest particulars an affection that proceeds from the Lord, who is life itself. And therefore whatsoever things are 
from the Lord, have life in them, because they contain faith toward Him, and are here signified by the "living soul:" they have also a species of body, here signified by "what moves itself" or "creeps." 
These truths, however, are as yet deep secrets to man, and are now mentioned only because the "living soul" and the "thing moving itself" are treated of. </p>

<p align="center"><b>Elliott(1983-1999) 41</b></p><p><b>41.</b>
Anything that is man's own has no life in it; and when depicted visually it looks like something hard as a bone and black. But anything that comes from the Lord does contain life. It has that which is 
spiritual and celestial within it, and when depicted visually it looks human and alive. It is perhaps incredible, but nevertheless absolutely true, that every expression, every idea, and every least 
thought of an angelic spirit is alive. In even the most detailed areas of his thought there is an affection that comes from the Lord, who is life itself. Consequently all that derives from the Lord has 
life within it, for it contains faith in Him, and is here meant by 'a living creature'. It then has the outward appearance of a body, meant here by that which is moving, or creeping. To man these matters 
remain arcana, but since the subject here is the living and moving creature, they ought at least to be mentioned here.

</p><b>41.</b>
Quicquid proprium est hominis, hoc nullam in se vitam habet, dumque sistitur videndum, apparet durum sicut osseum et nigrum; at quicquid a Domino, vitam habet, est in illo spirituale et caeleste, et 
dum sistitur videndum, apparet ut humanum vivum: et quod incredibile forte sed usque verissimum, quod unaquaevis vox, unaquaevis idea, et unumquodvis minimum cogitationis spiritus angelica, vivat; in 
singularissimis ejus est affectio procedens a Domino, Qui est ipsa vita: quare quae a Domino, habent vitam in se, quia fidem in Ipsum, et significantur hic per 'animam viventem'; tum habent speciem corporis 
hic significatam per 'se movens' seu 'reptans': at haec adhuc homini arcana sunt, sed quia agitur hic de anima vivente et se movente, hic solum memoranda.  </p>
