<h4 align="center"></h4><p><strong>991.</strong>“海里一切的鱼”表知识。这从“鱼”的含义清楚可知。在圣言中，“鱼”表源于感官之物的知识。因为知识分为三种：觉性的、理性的和感性的。所有这些都被植入在记忆中，确切地说，被植入在记忆系统（内在记忆与外在记忆）中，并在重生之人里面被主经由内在人从那里被召唤出来。当人活在肉身时，这些源于感官之物的记忆知识会进入他的意识或知觉，因为他通过它们思考。而剩余的更为内在，不会进入知觉，直到人脱去肉体，进入来生。关于水所滋生的鱼或爬行物表记忆的知识，可参看40节；关于“鲸鱼”或“海怪”表这些知识的总源头，可参看42节。此外，这一切从以下圣言经文同样可以清楚看出来。西番雅书：<br />我必使人和牲畜绝迹；我必使空中的鸟、海里的鱼绝迹。（西番雅书<a href="http://39-27.cn/番1.3.htm">1:3</a>）<br />“空中的鸟”表理性，“海里的鱼”表低等的理性，出于感性记忆知识的人的思维。<br />哈巴谷书：<br />你为何使人如海中的鱼，又如没有管辖的爬行物呢？（哈巴谷书<a href="http://39-27.cn/哈1.14.htm">1:14</a>）<br />“使人如海中的鱼”表使他唯独依赖于感官。何西阿书：<br />这陆地悲哀，其中所有的居民、田野的野兽、空中的鸟必都衰微；海中的鱼也必都聚在一起。（何西阿书<a href="http://39-27.cn/何4.3.htm">4:3</a>）<br />“海中的鱼”表源于感官的记忆知识。诗篇：<br />你把一切都放在他的脚下；就是一切的牛羊、田野的野兽、空中的飞行物、海里的鱼，凡经行海道的。（诗篇<a href="http://39-27.cn/诗8.6.htm">8:6</a>-<a href="http://39-27.cn/诗8.8.htm">8</a>）<br />这是指主主导人。“海里的鱼”表记忆知识。“海”表知识或认知的聚集（对此，参看前面<a href="28.htm">28</a>节）。以赛亚书：<br />渔夫必哀哭，所有在尼罗河上垂钓的必悲伤，在水面上撒网的必都衰弱。（以赛亚书<a href="http://39-27.cn/赛19.8.htm">19:8</a>）<br />“渔夫”表那些只信赖感官之物，并出于这些孵化虚假之人，因为主题是埃及，或记忆知识领域。</p>

<p><strong>[NCE]991.</strong> As for all the fish of the sea symbolizes facts, as the symbolism of a fish indicates.<br />Fish in the Word symbolize facts that rise out of sensory information. There are three kinds of fact: facts truly understood, facts seen rationally, and facts coming from the senses. All three kinds are sown in the memory, or rather in different types of memory,{*1} and in a regenerate person it is from the memory by way of the inner self that the Lord calls on them. The last type — facts gleaned from sensory evidence — comes to our awareness or notice while we are physically alive, because we base our thinking on it. The other two, which are deeper, do not do so until we have put off our bodies and entered the other world.<br />For the symbolism of fish, or the creeping things that the waters produce, as facts, see <a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_991/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_40" target=_top>40</a> above. For the symbolism of a large sea creature, or whale, as general categories of fact, see <a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_991/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_42" target=_top>42</a>.<br />The symbolism can be further established by the following passages in the Word. In Zephaniah:<br />I will make human and animal die out, I will make the bird in the heavens and the fish in the sea die out. (<a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_991/bible_king-james-version_zephaniah_1_3" target=_top>Zephaniah 1:3</a>)<br />The bird in the heavens stands for rational concepts, the fish in the sea for rational concepts on a lower plane, that is, for human thought that develops out of facts supplied by the senses.<br />[2] In Habakkuk:<br />You will make humankind like the fish of the sea, like a creeping thing, which has no ruler. (<a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_991/bible_king-james-version_habakkuk_1_14" target=_top>Habakkuk 1:14</a>)<br />Making humankind like the fish of the sea stands for making us entirely sense-oriented. In Hosea:<br />The earth will mourn, and everything living in it will lose strength, including the wild animal of the field and the bird of the heavens; and the fish of the sea will also disappear. (<a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_991/bible_king-james-version_hosea_4_3" target=_top>Hosea 4:3</a>)<br />The fish of the sea stand for facts yielded by sensory evidence. In David:{*2} All things you have put under his feet: the animals of the fields, the flying thing in the heavens, and the fish in the sea — that which travels the thoroughfares of the seas. (<a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_991/bible_king-james-version_psalms_8_6-7" target=_top>Psalms 8:6-7</a>, <a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_991/bible_king-james-version_psalms_8_8" target=_top>8</a>)<br />This is about the Lord's power to rule in us. The fish in the sea stand for facts. Seas symbolize facts — knowledge — gathered together, as may be seen earlier, in <a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_991/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_28" target=_top>28</a>. In Isaiah:<br />The fishers will lament, and all who cast a hook into the river will mourn, and those spreading a net on the face of the water will languish. (<a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_991/bible_king-james-version_isaiah_19_8-9" target=_top>Isaiah 19:8-9</a>)<br />The fishers stand for those who rely exclusively on the testimony of the senses, from which they hatch false ideas. The passage has to do with Egypt, or factual knowledge.<br /><br /><strong>Footnotes:</strong><br />{*1} Sections 1639, 2469-2494 describe an inner and outer memory. [LHC]<br />{*2} As was the custom in his day, Swedenborg refers to Psalms as a book of David. [Editors] </p>

And to all the fishes of the sea. That this signifies memory-knowledges [scientifica], is evident from the signification of a fish. "Fishes" in the Word signify memory-knowledges, which spring from things 
of sense. For memory-knowledges [scientifica] are of three kinds: intellectual, rational, and sensuous. All these are planted in the memory, or rather memories, and in the regenerate man are called 
forth thence by the Lord, through the internal man. These memory-knowledges which are from things of sense come to man's sensation or perception when he lives in the body, for he thinks from them. 
The rest, which are interior, do not come so much to perception until man puts off the body and enters the other life. That "fishes" or the creeping things which the waters produce, signify memory-knowledges, 
may be seen above (n. 40); and that a "whale" or "sea monster" signifies the generals of these knowledges (n. 42). Moreover the same is evident from the following passages in the Word. In Zephaniah: </p>
<p> 
    I will make man and beast to fail; I will make the fowls of the heavens and the fishes of the sea to fail (Zeph. 1:3), where the "fowls of the heavens" denote things of reason, and the 
"fishes of the sea" lower rational things, that is, man's thought from sensuous memory-knowledges.  [2] In Habakkuk: </p>
<p>     Thou makest man as the fishes of the sea, as the creeping thing that has no 
ruler over them (Hab. 1:14), where "making man as the fishes of the sea" means that he is altogether sensuous. In Hosea: </p>
<p>     Therefore shall the land mourn, and everyone that dwelleth therein shall 
languish, with the wild animal of the field and the fowl of the heavens; yea, the fishes of the sea also shall be gathered (Hos. 4:3), where the "fishes of the sea" denote memory-knowledges from things 
of sense. In David: </p>
<p>     Thou hast put all things under his feet; all sheep and oxen, yea, and the beasts of the field, the fowl of the air, and the fish of the sea, whatsoever passeth through the 
paths of the seas (Ps. 8:6-8), speaking of the dominion of the Lord in man, the "fish of the sea" denote memory-knowledges. That "seas" signify the gathering together of knowledges [scientificorum 
seu cognitionum], may be seen above (n. 28). In Isaiah: </p>
<p>     The fishers shall lament, and all they that cast a hook into the river shall mourn, and they that spread a net upon the faces of the waters 
shall languish (Isa. 19:8); </p>
<p>"fishers" denoting those who trust only in things of sense, and out of these hatch falsities; the subject being Egypt, or the realm of memory-knowledge. </p>

'All fish of the sea' means facts. This is clear from the meaning of 'a fish'. In the Word fish mean facts that spring from sensory evidence, for there are three types of facts - intellectual, rational, 
and sensory. All are implanted in the memory - or rather, in the memories<A name="fntext1"></a><A href="#fn1"><sup>a</sup></a> - and in someone who is regenerate are summoned from there by the Lord by way of the internal man. These facts which come 
from sensory evidence enter a person's consciousness or perception during his earthly life, for they are the basis of his thinking. The rest, which are more interior, do not do so until he has shed the 
body and enters the next life. On the point that fish or creeping things which the waters produce mean facts, see what has been said already in <a href="40.htm">40</a>; and that sea-monsters or whales mean general sources 
of facts, see <a href="42.htm">42</a>. These points become additionally clear from the following places in the Word: In Zephaniah, </p>
<blockquote>
I will cause man and beast to cease, I will cause the birds of the air and the fish 
of the sea to cease. <a href="http://bible.gospelcom.net/cgi-bin/bible?passage=Zeph%201:3&amp;version=ESV&amp;interface=print&amp;showfn=yes&amp;showxref">Zeph 1:3</a>. 
</blockquote>
<p>Here 'birds of the air' stands for rational concepts, 'fish of the sea' for rational concepts of a lower order, that is, for human thought from factual knowledge derived 
through the senses. </p>
<p></p>
<p><b>[2]</b>
 In Habakkuk, </p>
<blockquote>
 You will make man like the fish of the sea, like creeping things that have no ruler. <a href="http://bible.gospelcom.net/cgi-bin/bible?passage=Hab%201:14&amp;version=ESV&amp;interface=print&amp;showfn=yes&amp;showxref">Hab 1:14</a>. 
</blockquote>
<p>'Making man like the fish of the sea' stands for making 
him dependent solely on the senses. In Hosea,  </p>
<blockquote>
The land will mourn, and every inhabitant will languish, even the wild animal of the field, and the birds of the air,<A name="fntext2"></a><A href="#fn2"><sup>b</sup></a> and even the fish of the 
sea will all be gathered together. <a href="http://bible.gospelcom.net/cgi-bin/bible?passage=Hosea%204:3&amp;version=ESV&amp;interface=print&amp;showfn=yes&amp;showxref">Hosea 4:3</a>. 
</blockquote>
Here 'fish of the sea' stands for factual knowledge derived through the senses. In David, </p>
<blockquote>
 You have put all things under His feet, the beasts of the fields, 
the flying things of the air,<A name="fntext3"></a><A href="#fn3"><sup>c</sup></a> and the fish of the sea, and that crossing the paths of the seas. <a href="http://bible.gospelcom.net/cgi-bin/bible?passage=Ps%208:6-8&amp;version=ESV&amp;interface=print&amp;showfn=yes&amp;showxref">Ps 8:6-8</a>.  
</blockquote>
<p>This refers to the Lord's dominion over man. 'Fish of the sea' stands for facts. 
That 'seas' means a gathering of facts or cognitions, see what has appeared already in <a href="28.htm">28</a>. In Isaiah, </p>
<blockquote>
The fishermen will lament, and all who cast a hook into the river will mourn, and those who spread 
nets over the face'<A name="fntext4"></a><A href="#fn4"><sup>d</sup></a> of the waters will languish. <a href="http://bible.gospelcom.net/cgi-bin/bible?passage=Isa%2019:8&amp;version=ESV&amp;interface=print&amp;showfn=yes&amp;showxref">Isa 19:8</a>. 
</blockquote>
<p>'Fishermen' stands for people who rely on sensory evidence alone and hatch falsities out of it, the subject being Egypt, or factual 
knowledge.

'Ad omnes pisces maris': quod significet scientifica, constat a significatione 'piscis': pisces in Verbo significant scientifica quae oriuntur ex sensualibus; sunt enim triplicis generis scientifica: 
intellectualia, rationalia et sensualia; omnia inseminantur memoriae seu potius memoriis, et in regenerato inde a Domino per internum hominem evocantur; haec scientifica quae a sensualibus, ad sensationem 
seu perceptionem hominis cum vivit in corpore, veniunt, nam ab illis cogitat; cetera quae interiora sunt, non ita, priusquam exuto corpore in alteram vitam venit.  Quod 'pisces seu reptilia' quae 
aquae producunt, significent scientifica, videatur prius n. 40; et quod 'cetus seu balaena' communia scientificorum, n. 42; et praeterea constare potest ab his in Verbo locis: apud Zephaniam, 	Deficere 
faciam hominem et bestiam; deficere faciam avem caelorum, et pisces maris, i 3; </p>
<p>ubi 'avis caelorum' pro rationalibus, 'pisces maris' pro rationalibus inferioribus seu pro cogitatione hominis ex

<p>'facere hominem sicut pisces maris' pro prorsus sensualem: apud Hosheam, 	Lugebit
