<h4 align="center"></h4><p><strong>1264.</strong>综上所述，清楚可知，虽然本章只出现了民族和宗族的名字，但它不仅总体上包含了古教会所存在的有关仁之善和信之真的所有不同敬拜形式，还包含了每个教会中所存在的所有敬拜形式；事实上，它所包含的东西，比任何人想象的还要多。这就是主圣言的性质。<br />关于洪水前灭亡的人</p>

<p><strong>[NCE]1264.</strong> These remarks now indicate that although the present chapter is composed simply of the names of nations and clans, the contents still include all the different ways in which worship embodied charitable good and religious truth in the ancient church. The chapter describes such differences as they existed not only in the ancient church in general but in each individual church as well. In fact it holds more information than anyone could ever believe. That is the nature of the Lord's Word. </p>
<p align="center"><b>Potts(1905-1910) 1264</b></p><p><b>1264.</b>
From all this it may now be seen that although in this chapter mere names of nations and families occur, yet it contains, in general, not only all the differences of worship as regards the goods of charity 
and truths of faith that were in the Ancient Church, but also all that are in any church; in fact it contains more than any man could ever believe. Such is the Word of the Lord. </p>

<p align="center"><b>Elliott(1983-1999) 1264</b></p><p><b>1264.</b>
From all these considerations it now becomes clear that although no more than the names of nations and families occur in this chapter, it nevertheless contains in general not only all the different forms 
of worship as regards goods stemming from charity and as regards truths of faith that existed in the Ancient Church, but also those that exist in every Church. Indeed this chapter contains more than 
anyone can possibly believe. Such is the nature of the Word of the Lord. </p>

<p align="center"><b>Latin(1748-1756) 1264</b>
</p><b>1264.</b>
Ex his nunc constare potest quod tametsi mera nomina gentium et familiarum in hoc capite occurrunt, quod usque contineat in genere non solum omnes differentias cultus quoad bona charitatis et vera fidei 
quae in Antiqua Ecclesia fuerunt, sed etiam quae in unaquavis Ecclesia; immo plura quam usquam homo credere possit; tale est Verbum Domini. </p>
