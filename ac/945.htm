<h3 align="center" class="ired">属天的奥秘 第945节</h3>
<h4 align="center"></h4><p><strong>945.</strong>然而，对于那些出身于生活的享受和乐趣中，并且自小就在这类事物中被抚养成长的女人，诸如女王，贵族成员以及富人来说，情况则不然。尽管这些女人也过着奢侈、华丽和典雅的生活，但只要她们同时活在对主之信和对邻之仁中，那么在来生，她们就在幸福之中。认为只有放弃生活的乐趣、权力和财富，经受困苦才配得天堂的观念是不正确的。圣言中说放弃这类事物的意思是：与主相比，快乐、权力和财富无足轻重，与天堂的生活相比，尘世的生活毫无意义。</p>

<p><strong>[NCE]945.</strong> This is not the case, however, with women who have been born into the creature comforts and pleasures of life and have been brought up to these advantages since infancy — queens, for instance, and other nobility, and the rich too. Although they live a life of sensual gratification, luxury, and grandeur, as long as they also live one of faith in the Lord and charity toward their neighbor they are among the happy in the next life.<br />To forswear life's pleasures, power, and wealth in order to earn heaven through one's suffering is wrong. What is meant in the Word is to think of pleasures, power, and wealth as nothing compared to the Lord, and the life of the world as nothing compared to the life of heaven [<a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_945/bible_king-james-version_matthew_19_21-24" target=_top>Matthew 19:21-24</a>; <a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_945/bible_king-james-version_mark_10_21-25" target=_top>Mark 10:21-25</a>; <a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_945/bible_king-james-version_luke_18_22-25" target=_top>Luke 18:22-25</a>]. </p>
<p align="center"><b>Potts(1905-1910) 945</b></p><p><b>945.</b>
It is otherwise with those who have been born into the pleasures and enjoyments of life, and who have been educated in such things from childhood, such as queens, and others of noble family, and also 
those of wealthy parentage. These, though they have lived in luxury, splendor, and elegance, provided they have lived at the same time in faith in the Lord and charity toward the neighbor, are among 
the happy in the other life. For to deprive oneself of the enjoyments of life, of power, and of riches, and to think thus to merit heaven by wretchedness, is a false course. But to esteem pleasures and 
power and riches as nothing in comparison with the Lord, and the life of the world as nothing in comparison with heavenly life, this is what is meant in the Word by renouncing these things. </p>

<p align="center"><b>Elliott(1983-1999) 945</b></p><p><b>945.</b>
It is different however with women who have been born to the enjoyments and pleasures of life and who have been brought up with those things since early childhood, as queens and members of the aristocracy 
are, and as the wealthy are too. If while living in luxury, grandeur, and splendour, they have at the same time lived in faith in the Lord and in charity towards the neighbour, they are among the 
happy in the next life. For the idea that heaven is merited by renouncing the enjoyments of life and by renouncing power and wealth, and so by suffering hardship is untrue. What the Word means by such 
renunciation is rating pleasures as well as power and wealth as nothing in comparison with the Lord, and the life of the world as nothing in comparison with heavenly life. </p>

<p align="center"><b>Latin(1748-1756) 945</b>
</p><b>945.</b>
Aliter vero quae in voluptates aut jucunditates vitae natae sunt, et quae ab infantia in similia educatae; sicut reginae, ex nobili prosapia aliae, ut et divites; quae tametsi in voluptatibus et lautitiis 
inque splendidis, dummodo in fide in Dominum et in charitate erga proximum simul vixerunt, in altera vita inter felices sunt: nam se abdicare jucundis vitae, potentiam et divitias, et sic per miserias 
mereri caelum, hoc falsum est; sed tam voluptates quam potentiam et divitias pro nihilo aestimare respective ad Dominum, et vitam mundi pro nihilo respective ad vitam caelestem, est quod in Verbo 
intelligitur. </p>
