<h3 align="center" class="ired">属天的奥秘 第8234节</h3>
<h4 align="center"></h4><p><strong>8234.</strong>“以色列人却走在海中间的干地上”表那些处于真理之良善和良善之真理的人安全通过这地狱，没有受到侵扰。这从前面的解释（<a href="8185.htm">8185</a>节）清楚可知，那里有类似的话。说“那些处于真理之良善和良善之真理的人”是用来表示属灵教会；因为属灵教会成员首先处于真理之良善，然后处于良善之真理。事实上，他们一开始行善是因为真理规定应当行善；因此，他们出于对真理的服从行事；但他们后来行善是出于对真理的情感。这时，他们出于良善看见并实行真理。由此明显可知，一个属灵教会成员在从主接受一个新意愿，也就是在重生之前，是出于对真理的服从而实行真理；但重生之生则出于对真理的情感实行真理，并且这时，对他来说，真理变成了良善，因为它现在属于他的意愿。事实上，出于服从行事就是出于理解力行事；而出于情感行事就是出于意愿行事。这也是为何那些出于服从行真理的人是外在教会成员，而那些出于情感行真理的人是内在教会成员。由此明显可知，当说到“那些处于真理之良善和良善之真理的人时，所指的是那些属于属灵教会的人。</p>

And the sons of Israel went on the dry into the midst of the sea. That this signifies that they who were in the good of truth and the truth of good passed safely through that hell without infestation, 
is evident from what was unfolded above (n. 8185), where are the like words. It is said "in the good of truth and in the truth of good," and there is meant the spiritual church; for they who are of 
this church are first in the good of truth, and afterward in the truth of good; for at first they do what is good because the truth prescribes that it ought to be done, consequently from obedience; but 
afterward they do what is good from affection. Then they see truth from good and also do it. From this it is evident that before the man of the spiritual church receives a new will from the Lord, that 
is, before he has been regenerated, he does truth from obedience; but after he has been regenerated he does truth from affection, and then, to him, truth becomes good, because it is of the will. For 
to act from obedience is to act from the intellectual part; but to act from affection is to act from the will part. From this also it is that they who do truth from obedience are men of the external 
church; but they who do it from affection are men of the internal church. From all this it is evident that they who are of the spiritual church are meant when it is said "they who are in the good of 
truth and the truth of good." </p>

'And the children of Israel went on dry ground into the middle of the sea' means that those governed by the good of truth and guided by the truth of good passed through that hell in safety without suffering 
molestation. This is clear from the explanation above in <a href="8185.htm">8185</a>, where similar words occur. The expression 'those governed by the good of truth and guided by the truth of good' is used to mean the 
spiritual Church; for members of that Church are first governed by the good of truth, then later on are guided by the truth of good. At first they do good because truth lays down that it should be 
done; therefore they act out of obedience to it. But subsequently they do good out of affection for it, at which time truth is seen and also practiced by them from the standpoint of good. From this it 
is evident that before a member of the spiritual Church receives a new will from the Lord, that is, before he has been regenerated, he practices truth out of obedience to it. But after he has been regenerated 
he practices it out of affection for it, at which time truth comes for him to be good since it now resides in his will. For to act out of obedience is to act from the understanding, but to act 
out of affection is to act from the will. This also is the reason why those who practice truth out of obedience to it are members of the external Church, whereas those who practice it out of affection 
for it are members of the internal Church. From all this it is evident that those who belong to the spiritual Church are meant when the expression 'those governed by the good of truth and guided by 
the truth of good' is used. </p>

`Et filii Israelis iverunt in arido in medium maris': quod significet quod qui in bono veri et vero boni tuto absque infestatione transirent id infernum, constat ex illis quae supra n. 8185 explicata 
sunt, ubi similia verba.  In bono veri et in vero boni dicitur, et intelligitur Ecclesia spiritualis; qui enim ab hac Ecclesia sunt primum sunt in bono veri, deinde in vero boni; nam primum faciunt 
bonum quia verum dictat quod faciendum, proinde (c)ex oboedientia; postea autem faciunt bonum ex affectione; {1} tunc verum ex bono vident et quoque faciunt; exinde patet quod antequam homo Ecclesiae 
spiritualis novam voluntatem accipit a Domino, hoc est, antequam regeneratus est, faciat verum ex (x)oboedientia, sed postquam regeneratus est, faciat verum ex affectione, et tunc verum ei fit bonum, 
quia voluntatis est; nam facere ex oboedientia est ex intellectuali, at facere ex affectione est ex voluntario; inde quoque est quod illi qui faciunt verum ex oboedientia sint homines Ecclesiae externae, 
sed qui faciunt ex affectione sint homines Ecclesiae internae; ex his patet quod illi qui ab Ecclesia spirituali intelligantur cum dicitur qui in (x)bono veri et vero boni. 	@1 i et$ </p>
