<h4 align="center"></h4><p><strong>99.</strong>论到属灵之人的生命或生命次序，虽然主通过信流入其觉性、理性、知识，但是，由于其外在与内在冲突，其聪明就看似并非从主而来，而是从他自己通过知识和理性而来。至于属天之人的生命或生命次序，主通过爱与信流入其觉性、理性、知识，由于其内在与外在没有冲突，故他觉知生命真是从主流来。因此，属灵之人的颠倒，到了属天之人就得到了恢复。这种次序，或说这种人，就被称为“东方的伊甸园”。<br />在至高义上，耶和华神在东方的伊甸所立的园子就是主自己。在核心义上，亦即在宇宙义上，它表主的国，以及人成为属天者之后被安置的天堂。彼时，他与天堂的天使同在，仿佛其中的一员。因为人之受造，即使活在尘世，也能同时处于天堂。在此状态下，他的思维、念头，乃至言语、行为，都是开放的，甚至是源于主，内含属天属灵之性，皆有主的生命在内，赋予他觉知。</p>

<p><strong>[NCE]99.</strong> The inner life in people whose nature is spiritual is structured as follows: The faith they have does allow the Lord to enter into the things they understand, the things they grasp rationally, and the things they know. But since the more superficial levels of their mind are in conflict with the deeper levels, it does not seem as though their intelligence comes from the Lord. It appears to come from themselves and to be a product of their factual information and rational processes.<br />For people whose character is heavenly, on the other hand, the inner life is patterned in such a way that the Lord enters into their understanding, reason, and knowledge by way of love and the convictions of love. And since they are free of conflict, they can see that this is so.<br />The structure that so far has stood upside down in the spiritual person, then, returns to its proper position in the heavenly person. The heavenly structure, or the heavenly person, is called the garden on the east in Eden.<br />The garden planted by Jehovah God on the east in Eden is, in the highest sense, the Lord himself.<br />In the [next] deepest sense (which is also the universal sense), the garden is the Lord's kingdom or heaven, where we are put when we become heavenly. At that stage we keep company with angels in heaven and almost come to be one of them. (We were, in fact, created to be in heaven while at the same time living on earth.) All our thoughts then lie open, as do all the individual ideas that make up our thoughts, and all our words and deeds too, if these have anything heavenly or spiritual in them; and this openness extends clear to the Lord. His life, you see, is present in everyone, giving each the ability to perceive. </p>

Life, or the order of life, with the spiritual man, is such that although the Lord flows in, through faith, into the things of his understanding, reason, and memory [in ejus intellectualia, rationalia, 
et scientifica], yet as his external man fights against his internal man, it appears as if intelligence did not flow in from the Lord, but from the man himself, through the things of memory and reason 
[per scientifica et rationalia]. But the life, or order of life, of the celestial man, is such that the Lord flows in through love and the faith of love into the things of his understanding, reason, 
and memory [in ejus intellectualia, rationalia, et scientifica], and as there is no combat between the internal and the external man, he perceives that this is really so. Thus the order which up to 
this point had been inverted with the spiritual man, is now described as restored with the celestial man, and this order, or man, is called a "garden in Eden in the east." In the supreme sense, the "garden 
planted by Jehovah God in Eden in the east" is the Lord Himself. In the inmost sense, which is also the universal sense, it is the Lord's kingdom, and the heaven in which man is placed when he 
has become celestial. His state then is such that he is with the angels in heaven, and is as it were one among them; for man has been so created that while living in this world he may at the same time 
be in heaven. In this state all his thoughts and ideas of thoughts, and even his words and actions, are open, even from the Lord, and contain within them what is celestial and spiritual; for there is 
in every man the life of the Lord, which causes him to have perception. </p>

The life - that is, the order of life - as it exists with the spiritual man is such that the Lord flows in by means of faith, into his intellectual concepts, his rational concepts, and his factual knowledge. 
But because his external man is at war with the internal, it seems as though intelligence were not flowing in from the Lord but from himself by way of facts and rational concepts. But life - 
that is, the order of life - as it exists with the celestial man is such that the Lord flows in by way of love and of faith included with love into his intellectual concepts, his rational concepts, and 
his factual knowledge. And since there is no resistance, he perceives that this is the case. In this way order which up to now has with the spiritual man been turned upside-down is restored with the 
celestial. This order, which is man, is called 'the garden in Eden, from the east'. In the highest sense 'the garden planted by Jehovah God in Eden, from the east' is the Lord Himself; in the inmost 
sense, which is also the universal sense, it is the Lord's kingdom and heaven, where a person is placed on becoming celestial. At this point his state enables him to be with angels in heaven, and to be 
virtually one among them. In fact, man has been so created that while living on earth he may at the same time be in heaven. In that situation all of his thoughts, all his mental images produced by thoughts, 
and even his words and deeds lie open, containing what is celestial and spiritual. They lie open all the way from the Lord. Indeed everyone has the Lord' s life within him, enabling him to have 
perception.

</p><b>99.</b>
Talis vita seu ordo vitae est apud spiritualem hominem quidem influat Dominus per fidem in ejus intellectualia, rationalia et scientifica; sed quia externus ejus homo pugnat cum interno, apparet sicut 
intelligentia non influeret a Domino, sed a semet per scientifica rationalia; sed vita seu ordo vitae caelestis hominis est ut influat Dominus per amorem et fidem amoris in ejus intellectualia, rationalia 
et scientifica; et quia non est pugna, percipit quod ita sit: ita ordo, qui adhuc inversus est apud spiritualem, restitutus est apud caelestem: hic ordo, seu homo, appellatur 'hortus in Eden ab 
oriente.' 'Plantatus a Jehovah Deo hortus in Eden ab oriente' in sensu supremo est Ipse Dominus: in sensu intimo, qui etiam est sensus universalis, est regnum Domini, et caelum, in quo ponitur homo 
cum caelestis factus: stat ejus tunc est ut cum angelis in caelo sit, et quasi unus inter illos; enim creatus est homo ut simul dum vivit in terra, sit in caelo; omnes tunc ejus cogitationes, et cogitationum 
ideae, immo voces et actiones, sunt apertae, in quibus caeleste et spirituale, et patent usque a Domi: unicuique enim inest vita Domini, quae dat ut perceptionem habeat.
