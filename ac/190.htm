<h3 align="center" class="ired">属天的奥秘 第190节</h3>
<h4 align="center"></h4><p><h4 align="center">（一）经文1-13节</h4><br />（1）耶和华神所造的，惟有蛇比田间一切的活物更狡猾。蛇对女人说，神岂是真说，不许你们吃园中所有的树吗？<br />（2）女人对蛇说，园中树上的果子，我们可以吃，<br />（3）惟有园当中那棵树上的果子，神曾说，你们不可吃，也不可摸，免得你们死。<br />（4）蛇对女人说，你们不一定死，<br />（5）因为神知道，你们吃的日子眼睛就明亮了，你们便如神能知道善恶。<br />（6）于是女人见那棵树好作食物，也悦人的眼目，且是可喜爱的，能使人聪明，就摘下果子来吃了，又给她丈夫，她丈夫也吃了。<br />（7）他们二人的眼睛就明亮了，才知道自己是赤身露体，便编织无花果树的叶子，为自己作裙子。<br />（8）在天起凉风之日，那人和他妻子听见耶和华神的声音在园中回响，就藏在园里的树中，躲避耶和华神的面。<br />（9）耶和华神呼唤那人，对他说，你在哪里？<br />（10）他说，我在园中听见你的声音，我就害怕。因为我赤身露体，我便藏了。<br />（11）耶和华说，谁告诉你赤身露体呢？莫非你吃了我吩咐你不可吃的那树吗？<br />（12）那人说，你所赐给我，与我同居的女人，她把那树给我，我就吃了。<br />（13）耶和华神对女人说，你作的是什么事呢？女人说，那蛇引诱我，我就吃了。<br /><br /><h4 align="center">（二）概览</h4><br /><strong>190.</strong>本段论述上古教会的第三个阶段，此时，人对自我的渴望已相当强烈。</p>

And the snake was crafty above every wild animal of the field that Jehovah God had made, and it said to the woman, "Did God really say, ‘You must not eat from any tree of the garden'?"<br />2. And the woman said to the snake, "We are to eat from the fruit of the tree of the garden.<br />3. But from the fruit of the tree that is in the middle of the garden, God said, ‘You may not eat from it, nor are you to touch it, or you will die from it.'"<br />4. And the snake said to the woman, "You are not going to ‘surely die,'<br />5. because God knows that on the day when you eat from it, your eyes will be opened and you will be like God, knowing good and evil."<br />6. And the woman saw that the tree was good for eating, and that it was appealing to the eyes, and a tree desirable for lending insight. And she took some of its fruit and ate, and she gave to her husband too, who was with her, and he ate.<br />7. And the eyes of both were opened and they realized that they were naked. And they sewed together the leaf of the fig tree and made loincloths for themselves.<br />8. And they heard the voice of Jehovah God, going alone in the garden at the breeze of the day. And the human hid himself, as did his wife, from Jehovah God's face, in the middle of the tree of the garden.{*1} 9. And Jehovah God called to the human and said to him, "Where are you?"<br />10. And he said, "I heard your voice in the garden, and I was afraid because I was naked, and I hid myself."<br />11. And he said, "Who pointed out to you that you were naked? You ate from the tree from which I commanded you not to eat, didn't you?"<br />12. And the human said, "The woman whom you gave to be with me, she gave me from the tree and I ate."<br />13. And Jehovah God said to the woman, "Why have you done this?" And the woman said, "The snake deceived me and I ate."<br />190. Summary<br />THESE verses deal with the third stage of the earliest church, in which people's eagerness for autonomy amounted to a passion.<br /><br /><strong>Footnotes:</strong><br />{*1} (in the text of <a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_190/bible_king-james-version_genesis_3_8" target=_top>Genesis 3:8</a>). "Tree" here is usually taken as a collective noun for all the trees in the garden, among which the woman and her husband were walking, but Swedenborg sees significance in the singular form of the word, as he explains in <a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_190/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_218" target=_top>218</a>.
