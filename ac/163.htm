And they were both naked, the human and his wife, and did not blush.<br />They were naked and did not blush means that they were innocent; the Lord introduced innocence into their selfhood to keep it from being objectionable. </p>
<p align="center"><b>Potts(1905-1910) 163</b></p><p><b>163.</b>
Verse 25. And they were both naked, the man and his wife, and were not ashamed. Their being "naked, and not ashamed" signifies that they were innocent, for the Lord had insinuated innocence into their 
Own, to prevent its being unacceptable. </p>

<p align="center"><b>Elliott(1983-1999) 163</b></p><p><b>163.</b>
Verse 25 And they were both naked, the man and his wife, and they were not ashamed. 'They were naked and they were not ashamed' means that they were innocent. To be exact, the Lord had instilled innocence 
into their proprium to keep it from being unacceptable.  </p>

<p align="center"><b>Latin(1748-1756) 163</b>
</p><b>163.</b>
Vers. 25.  Et fuerunt ambo nudi, homo et uxor illius, et non erubuerunt.  Quod 'nudi fuerunt, et non erubuerunt' significat innocentes; scilicet quod Dominus insinuaverit proprio illorum innocentiam 
ne ingratum esset. </p>
