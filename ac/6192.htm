<h3 align="center" class="ired">属天的奥秘 第6192节</h3>
<h4 align="center"></h4><p><strong>6192.</strong>通过活生生的演示，我被指示灵人以哪种方式流入一个人。当来到他这里时，他们就接受他的记忆所包含的一切，因而接受他从小所学习并保留下来的一切。于是，这些灵人以为他们所接受的东西是他们自己的，由此可以说在这个人里面扮演了这个人的角色；但他们不准进一步进入形成此人的思维和意愿的内层部分；不准进入言行的外层部分；因为这些外层部分通过来自主的一种总体流注发挥作用，具体的灵人或天使不可介入。尽管就那些形成此人思维和意愿的事物而言，灵人在这个人里面扮演了这个人的角色，但实际上，他们仍没有意识到他们与他同在。原因在于，他们占有了他的记忆所包含的一切，并以为这些不是别人的，而是他们自己的。另一个原因是，这样可以防止他们伤害此人。事实上，来自地狱、与人同在的灵人若不认为他的记忆内容是他们自己的，就会想尽一切办法毁灭他，包括身体和灵魂，因为这就是地狱的快乐本身。</p>

<p align="center"><b>Potts(1905-1910) 6192</b></p><p><b>6192.</b>
It has been shown me to the life in what manner spirits flow in with man. When they come to him, they put on all things of his memory, thus all things which the man has learned and imbibed from infancy, 
and the spirits suppose these things to be their own. Thus they act as it were the part of the man in the man. But they are not allowed to enter further with a man than to his interiors which are 
of the thought and will, and not to the exteriors which are of the actions and speech; for these latter come into act by means of a general influx from the Lord without the mediation of particular spirits 
and angels. But although the spirits act the part of the man with a man in respect to those things which are of his thought and will, they nevertheless do not know that they are with a man, for the 
reason that they possess all things of his memory, and believe that these are not another's, but their own; and this for the reason also that they may not injure the man. For unless the spirits from 
hell who are with a man believed these things to be their own, they would attempt in every way to destroy the man both body and soul, because this is the infernal delight itself. </p>

<p align="center"><b>Elliott(1983-1999) 6192</b></p><p><b>6192.</b>
I have been shown by live demonstration the manner in which spirits flow in with a person. When they come to him they adopt everything his memory contains, thus everything he has learned and retained 
since early childhood. Then the spirits suppose that what they have adopted is their own and thus play the part so to speak of the person in the person; but they are not allowed to go beyond the interior 
parts forming the person's thought and will. They are not allowed to enter the exterior parts of actions and speech; for these are brought into play by means of a general influx from the Lord, without 
the intervention of specific spirits or angels. But although the spirits play the part of the person in the person so far as what forms his thought and will is concerned, they are not actually aware 
of their presence with him. The reason for this is that they take possession of all that his memory contains and imagine that it does not belong to another but is their own. A further reason is that 
they are thus prevented from doing the person harm, for if the spirits from hell who are present with a person did not imagine the contents of his memory were their own they would try by every method 
to destroy the person, body and soul, since that is hell's essential delight. </p>

<p align="center"><b>Latin(1748-1756) 6192</b>
</p><b>6192.</b>
Ostensum mihi ad vivum est quomodo spiritus influunt apud hominem; cum veniunt ad illum, induunt omnia ejus memoriae, ita omnia quae homo ab infantia didicit et imbuit, et spiritus haec putant esse 
sua, ita agunt quasi hominem apud hominem; sed non ulterius intrare apud hominem eis licet quam ad interiora ejus quae sunt cogitationis et voluntatis, non autem ad exteriora quae sunt actionum et loquelae; 
haec enim per influxum communem a Domino, absque particularium spirituum et angelorum mediatione, actum consequuntur; at spiritus tametsi agunt hominem apud hominem quoad illa quae sunt ejus cogitationis 
et voluntatis, usque tamen non sciunt quod sint apud hominem, ex causa quia possident omnia ejus memoriae, et credunt quod illa non alterius sed sua sint; et quoque ex causa ne laedant hominem, 
nam nisi spiritus qui apud hominem ab inferno, crederent esse sua, conarentur omni modo hominem quoad corpus et quoad animam perdere; nam hoc est ipsum jucundum infernale. </p>
