<h3 align="center" class="ired">属天的奥秘 第2733节</h3>
<h4 align="center"></h4><p><strong>2733.</strong>有某些灵，因在肉身时所养成的习惯，以特有的技能对我进行干扰。他们的流注相当温和，如同波浪，类似正直的灵人所常用的那种。但我发觉，这流注当中藏着诡诈等恶，意欲进行诱惑和欺骗。最后，我得与其中一人交谈。我被告知，他在世时曾是军队的指挥官。我发现他的思想观念中含有淫乱的成分，于是便用灵人的语言与他谈论婚姻。灵人的语言能以代表物说明这一点，并在须臾之间将人的感觉、观点，以及很多事完全表达出来。<br />他说在肉身时，他根本没有思想过淫欲。我被允许告诉他，行淫是恐怖邪恶的，虽然对于像他那样以行淫为乐并进而将之合理化的人来说看似是无可厚非甚至是天经地义的。他从以下事实或许知道这一点，即婚姻是人类的苗床，因而也是天国的苗床。所以，人们决不能以任何理由亵渎婚姻，而当视之为圣。我继续说，从下面的考虑，他或许也能知道行淫是恐怖邪恶的：他现已在灵界，处于直觉的状态，故应该意识到婚姻之爱是由主那里从天而降的，作为天国根基的相爱，也是从婚姻之爱而生的，如从父母而生。或许他还可以从这一事实知道这一点：行淫者一靠近天上的社群，便立时察觉到自己的恶臭，因而直奔地狱。最起码，他该明白，破坏婚姻就是违反神的律法，也违反所有国家的法律和真正的理性之光，因为这既违背神的次序，也违背人的次序，更不用说其它考虑了。<br />但他回答说，他在肉身时从来就不知道这些事，也从未思考过它们。他想推理这些事是否如此，不过被告知，在来世，真理没有推理的余地。因为推理只会支持人的快乐，乃至支持假与恶。我继续告诉他，首先，他当思想所告诉他的事，因为它们都是真理。或者，他可以从己所不欲勿施于人这一世所公认的原则开始思考。我问他，若有人淫其所爱之妻（结婚初期人一般皆爱其妻），盛怒之下，他岂不谴责行淫为可憎？作为一个男人，理性之下，他岂不决然反对一切淫行，乃至咒其堕入地狱？因此，他是能自主判断的。</p>

There were certain spirits who from practice in the life of the body infested me with peculiar adroitness, and this by a somewhat gentle influx, like a wave, such as that of upright spirits is wont to 
be; but it was perceived that there was in it craftiness and the like, to captivate and deceive. I at length spoke with one of them who I was told had been in the world the commander of an army. And 
as I perceived that in the ideas of his thought there was lasciviousness, I spoke with him about marriage. The speech of spirits is illustrated by representatives, which fully express the sense, and 
many things in a moment of time. [2] He said that in the life of the body he thought nothing of adulteries. But it was given to tell him that adulteries are horribly wicked-though to such men they do 
not appear to be so, but even allowable, owing to the delight they take in them, and the persuasion therefrom-which he might also know from the fact that marriages are the nurseries of the human race, 
and hence also the nurseries of the heavenly kingdom, and on that account are in no wise to be violated, but to be kept holy; as well as from the consideration that being in the other life and in a 
state of perception he ought to be aware that conjugial love comes down through heaven from the Lord; and that from that love, as from a parent, is derived mutual love, which is the basis of heaven; and 
also from the fact that when adulterers merely approach heavenly societies they become sensible of their own stench, and cast themselves down toward hell. Further, he might at least know that to violate 
marriages is contrary to the Divine laws, and contrary to the civil laws of all, and also contrary to the genuine light of reason, because contrary to order both Divine and human; and much more 
besides. [3] But he answered that he had never known such things in the life of the body, nor had thought of them. He wished to reason whether they were so; but was told that in the other life truth 
does not admit of reasonings, for these favor one's delights, and thus his evils and falsities; and that he ought first to think of the things that had been said, because they were true. Or he ought also 
to think from the principle most fully known in the world, that one must not do to another what he is not willing that the other should do to him: and thus, if anyone had in such a manner beguiled 
his wife, whom he loved-as everyone does in the beginning of marriage-would he not himself also at that time, when in a state of wrath about it, if he spoke from that state, have detested adulteries? 
And at the same time, as he was of superior talent, would he not have confirmed himself against them more than others, even to condemning them to hell? And thus he might have judged himself from himself. </p>

There were certain spirits who, from a practice followed by them during their lifetime, were molesting me with particular skill. They did so by means of a rather gentle wave-like influx, resembling the 
ordinary influx from upright spirits. But I perceived that within that influx trickery and the like were present, to entice and to deceive. At length I spoke to one of them who, I was told, had during 
his lifetime been the commander of an army. And because I perceived that licentiousness was present in the ideas comprising his thought, I talked to him about marriage in the language used by spirits, 
which is illustrated with representatives and which expresses one's sentiments completely and many things in an instant. </p>

<p><b>[2]</b>
 He said that during his lifetime he had thought nothing of adulterous 
behaviour. But I was given to tell him that all adultery is quite unspeakable, even though to those who are guilty of it it does not seem - because of the delight they take in it and the persuasive 
beliefs that result from it - to be unspeakable, but even allowable. I said that he might also know this from the fact that marriages are the seminaries of the human race and therefore the seminaries 
of the heavenly kingdom as well, and for that reason must not on any account be violated but be held sacred. He might also know, I continued, that adultery is unspeakable from the fact, which he ought 
to know because he was now in the next life and in a state of perception, that conjugial love comes down from the Lord by way of heaven, and that from that love, as from a parent, mutual love is derived, 
which is the foundation on which heaven rests. And he might know it also from the fact that when they merely move towards heavenly communities adulterers become aware of their own stench and cast 
themselves away from there down towards hell. He might at least have known that violence done to marriages was contrary to Divine laws, and contrary to the civil laws of all people, as well as contrary 
to the genuine light of reason, since it is contrary to order, both Divine and human, not to mention many considerations besides these. </p>
<p></p>
<p><b>[3]</b>
 But he replied that he had never known such things during 
his lifetime, nor had he thought about them. He wished to reason whether what he had heard was so, but he was told that in the next life truth leaves no room for reasonings, for reasonings lend support 
to a person's delights, and so to his evils and falsities. I went on to tell him that he ought first to think about the things he had been told, because they were true; or at least he ought to 
think from the principle very widely known in the world that nobody ought to do to another what he does not wish that other to do to him. If some other man, I asked, had in a similar way seduced the wife 
whom he loved - as men love their wives at the beginning of every marriage - would he not also, when feeling irate about what had occurred, have expressed, if he spoke from that feeling, a loathing 
for all adultery? Also, being a man with mental ability, would he not have confirmed himself more than others against all adultery, even condemning it to hell? Thus he might have judged himself from 
what he possessed within himself. </p>

Erant quidam spiritus qui ex usu in vita corporis, me solertia peculiari infestabant, et hoc per influxum molliusculum quasi undantem, qualis solet esse proborum spirituum, sed perceptum quod in illo 
essent astutiae et similia, ut captarent et fallerent; tandem locutus sum cum uno (c)eorum, qui quod fuerit dux exercitus cum vixit in mundo, mihi dictum est; et quia percepi quod in ideis cogitationis 
ejus esset lascivum, locutus cum illo de conjugio sum, loquela spirituum repraesentativis illustrata, quae plene exprimit sensa, et momento plura; dixit quod adulteria in vita corporis pro nihilo 
reputaverit; [2] sed ei dicere datum est {1} quod adulteria sint nefanda, tametsi apparent coram iis qui tales, ex jucundo quod captarunt et ex persuasivo inde, quod non talia, immo quod licita; quod 
etiam scire posset ex eo quod conjugia sint seminaria generis humani, et inde etiam seminaria regni caelestis, et idcirco quod nusquam violanda, sed sancta habenda; tum ex eo quod scire debet quia in 
altera vita est, ac in statu perceptionis, quod amor conjugialis a Domino per caelum descendat, et quod ab illo amore, ut a parente, derivetur amor mutuus, qui est firmamentum caeli; (m)et ex eo quod 
adulteri, dum modo approximant ad societates caelestes, quod sentiant graveolentiam suam, et se inde praecipitent versus infernum; ad minimum potuisset scire quod violare conjugia esset contra leges Divinas, 
et contra omnium leges civiles, tum contra genuinum lumen rationis, quia contra ordinem et Divinum et humanum, praeter plura: [3] sed respondebat quod talia nusquam sciverit in vita corporis, 
nec quod cogitaverit; voluit ratiocinari num ita esset, sed dictum quod veritas non admittat ratiocinia in altera vita, patrocinantur enim jucundis, ita malis et falsis; et quod primum cogitare debeat 
de illis quae dicta sunt quia vera; aut etiam ex illo principio quod notissimum [est] in orbe, quod nemo alteri facere debeat quod non velit ut alter faciet sibi, et sic si quis ipsius uxorem quam amavisset, 
quod {2} fit in principio omnis conjugii, tali modo decepisset, tunc cum in statu excandescentiae super id esset, si ex illo statu loqueretur, annon quoque ipse adulteria detestaturus fuisset, 
et tunc, quia ingenio pollet, se confirmavisset plus quam alii contra illa, usque ut damnavisset illa ad infernum; ita quod potuisset se judicare ex semet. 	@1 loquutus sum cum illo de conjugio, dixit 
quod in vita corporis adulteria pro nihilo reputaverit, loquela spirituum repraesentativis illustrata, quae plene exprimit sensa, et momento plurima; dicere ei datum est.$ 	@2 ut.$ </p>
