<h3 align="center" class="ired">属天的奥秘 第3098节</h3>
<h4 align="center"></h4><p><strong>3098.</strong>从3088节直到此处，包含在内义中的这些事也是诸如只有那些得到关于人之内在方面的教导，并拥有真理之人才能理解的那类事，因为启示通过并照着真理而来。此处论述的主题是真理初次被引入良善，因为如前所述，良善本身经由理性人，从而经由内在途径流入属世人，并启示那里的事物；而真理本身则经由感官，尤其经由听觉和视觉，从而经由外在途径流入属世人。真理由此源头产生，若反思一下，谁都能知道这一点。但良善与真理的结合并不在属世人里面，而是在理性人里面。因此，真理是从属世人中被召唤出来的，因而从属世气场进入属灵气场，因为要与良善联结的真理是属灵的。当真理初次从属世人中被召唤出来时，它的情况就是这几节（<a href="3087.htm">3087</a>-<a href="3097.htm">3097</a>节）所论述的主题。</p>

The things contained in the internal sense from n. 3088 to this point, are also such as can be apprehended by those only who have been instructed concerning the internals of man, and who are in truths; 
for through truths and according to truths, comes enlightenment. The subject here is the first initiation of truth into good; for as before said good itself flows into the natural through the rational, 
thus by an internal way, and enlightens the things which are therein; whereas truth itself inflows into the natural through the sensuous part, especially that of hearing and sight, and thus by an 
external way. Truth has its rise from this source, as may be known to everyone who reflects; but the conjunction of good and truth is not there, but is in the rational; therefore truth is called forth 
therefrom, thus out of the natural sphere into the spiritual; for the truth that is to be conjoined with good is spiritual. How the case is with the truth that is first called forth thence, is treated 
of in these verses (n. 3087-3097). </p>

The things contained in the internal sense from <a href="3088.htm">3088</a> to this point are also such as cannot be understood except by those who have been taught about the internal aspects of man and who are in possession 
of truths, for it is through truths and according to them that enlightenment comes. These verses deal with the initial introduction of truth into good, for as stated already, good itself flows into 
the natural by way of the rational, and so by an internal route, and enlightens the things that are there, while truth itself flows into the natural by way of the senses, in particular hearing and sight, 
and so by an external route. This is the origin of truth, as anyone may know if he stops to reflect. But good and truth do not exist joined together in the natural, but in the rational. Consequently 
truth is summoned from the natural - thus from a natural sphere into the spiritual sphere, for truth that is to be joined to good is spiritual. The situation with regard to truth when first summoned 
from there is the subject of the verses explained in <a href="3087.htm">3087</a>-<a href="3097.htm">3097</a>. </p>

Quae a n. 3088 huc usque in sensu interno continentur, etiam talia sunt quae non capi queunt nisi ab illis qui instructi sunt de internis hominis, et sunt in veris, nam per vera et secundum vera est 
illustratio; agitur de prima initiatione veri in bonum; nam, ut {1}dictum, ipsum bonum per rationale influit in naturale, ita per viam internam, ac illustrat illa quae ibi, ipsum verum autem influit 
per sensuale {2}imprimis auditus et visus in naturale, ita per viam externam, ortus veri est inde, quod etiam cuivis potest notum esse si reflectit; sed non est conjunctio boni et veri ibi, sed in rationali; 
quare inde verum evocatur, ita e naturali sphaera in spiritualem, nam verum conjungendum bono est spirituale: quomodo se habet cum vero primum inde evocato, in his versibus a n. 3087-3097 agitur. @1
