<h3 align="center" class="ired">属天的奥秘 第6753节</h3>
<h4 align="center"></h4><p><strong>6753.</strong>“说，因我把他从水里拉出来”表从虚假中释放出来。这从“水”和“拉出来”的含义清楚可知：“水”，即此处埃及河的水，是指虚假（参看<a href="6693.htm">6693</a>节）；“拉出来”是指解脱。这些话包含“摩西”之名所表示的状态的性质；就涉及主的至高意义而言，意思是这样：该状态具有这样的性质，为使祂的人身变成神的律法，主将它从由母亲那里所获得的、粘附于这人身的一切虚假中释放出来。祂持续如此行，直到祂变成神性律法，也就是神性真理本身，之后当得了荣耀时，变成神性良善，即神性真理的本质存在，也就是耶和华。</p>

And she said, Because I drew him out of the waters. That this signifies deliverance from falsities, is evident from the signification of "waters," here the waters of the river of Egypt, as being falsities 
(see n. 6693); and from the signification of "drawing out," as being deliverance. In these words is contained the quality of the state signified by the name "Moses;" which quality in the supreme 
sense involves that the Lord, in order that He might become the law Divine as to the Human, delivered it from every falsity which cleaved to His Human from the mother, and this until He became the Divine 
law, that is, the Divine truth itself, and afterward when glorified became the Divine good, which is the Esse of Divine truth, that is, is Jehovah. </p>

'And said, Because I drew him out of the water' means a deliverance from falsities. This is clear from the meaning of 'the water', here the water of the river of Egypt, as falsities, dealt with in <a href="6693.htm">6693</a>; 
and from the meaning of 'drawing out' as a deliverance. These words contain the essential nature of the state meant by Moses' name; and the meaning in the highest sense is this: The nature of the 
state was such that, in order to make His Human the law of God the Lord delivered it from all falsity that clung to the Human He received from His mother. He continued doing this until He became the Divine 
Law, which is Divine Truth itself, and after that, having been glorified, became Divine Goodness, which is the Essential Being (Esse) of Divine Truth, that is, Jehovah. </p>

`Et dixit, Quia ex aquis eduxi illum': quod significet liberationem a falsis, constat ex significatione `aquarum,' hic aquarum fluminis Aegypti, quod sint falsa, de qua n. 6693; et ex significatione 
`educere' quod sit liberatio.  In his verbis continetur quale status quod significatur per `nomen Moschis' quod quale in sensu supremo involvit quod Dominus ut lex Divina quoad Humanum fieret, liberaverit 
{1} ab omni falso quod Humano Suo a matre adhaesit, et hoc usque dum {2}factus est Divina Lex, hoc est, Ipsum Divinum Verum, et postmodum cum glorificatus, factus est Divinum Bonum, quod est Esse 
Divini Veri seu Jehovah. 	@1 i id$ 	@2 After Verum$ </p>
