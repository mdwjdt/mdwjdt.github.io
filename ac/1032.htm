<h3 align="center" class="ired">属天的奥秘 第1032节</h3>
<h4 align="center"></h4><p><strong>1032.</strong>“我要与你们立我的约”表主与所有拥有仁爱之人同在，并涉及“凡从方舟里出来的”和“地上一切野兽”，即教会之内的人和教会之外的人。这从刚才所述清楚可知。至于主也与教会之外、被称为外邦人的人立约，即藉着仁爱与他们结合。情况是这样：教会成员以为在教会之外、被称为外邦人的所有人都不会得救，因为他们没有信的认知，因此对主一无所知，并声称没有信和对主的认知就没有救赎，因而凡在教会之外的，注定被定罪。事实上，很多诸如拥有某种教义的人，甚至那些信奉异端的人，都认为凡在教会之外的人，即所有不持相同观点的人不会得救。然而，事实完全不是这样。主怜悯全人类，希望拯救并吸引全宇宙的人。<br />主的怜悯是无限的，不会只局限在教会内的少数人，而是一直延伸到全世界所有人。他们出身于教会之外，因而不知道信仰，这并非他们的过错。没人会因他在不知道主的情况下不信主而被定罪。凡有正确思维的人，谁会说，大部分人类会在永死中灭亡，只因他们没有生在人口相对较少的欧洲？凡有正确思维的人，谁又会说，主会容许芸芸众生生来就注定在永死中灭亡？这岂不违背神性、违背仁慈吗？而且，在教会之外、被称为外邦人的人所过的生活甚至比那些教会内的人更道德，他们更容易接受正信的教导，这通过来生的灵魂看得更清楚。<br />最坏的人反而出自所谓的基督教界，他们极端仇视邻人，甚至仇视主。他们比全世界任何人都更是名副其实的奸淫者。但世界上其它地区并非如此，因为很多崇拜偶像的人都有一种心态，认为仇恨和奸淫是可憎的。他们害怕基督徒是这样的人，害怕基督徒希望让别人遭受酷刑。事实上，外邦人的情况是这样：当接受天使有关信之真理及主掌管万有的教导时，他们会毫无困难地听从，并毫无困难地被赋予信仰，并因此抛弃他们的偶像。由于这个原因，那些过着道德生活，并处于彼此仁爱、纯真无邪的外邦人会在来生得以重生。他们活在世上时，主就在其仁爱和纯真中与之同在，因为仁爱和纯真唯独出于主。主还照其宗教信仰赋予他们对正确与良善的良知，将纯真和仁爱注入到这良知中。当纯真和仁爱存在于良知时，他们很容易允许自己被赋予源于良善的信之真理。主自己也在路加福音中这样说：<br />有一个人对耶稣说，主啊，得救的人少吗？祂对他们说，你们要看见亚伯拉罕、以撒、雅各，和众先知都在神的国里，你们自己却被赶到外面。从东、从西、从南、从北将有人来，在神的国里坐席。看哪，必有首先的成了末后的，末后的成了首先的。（路加福音<a href="http://39-27.cn/路13.23.htm">13:23</a>，<a href="http://39-27.cn/路13.28.htm">28</a>-<a href="http://39-27.cn/路13.30.htm">30</a>）<br />“亚伯拉罕、以撒、雅各”在此用来表所有拥有爱的人，如前所述。</p>

<p><strong>[NCE]1032.</strong> And I am setting up my pact with you symbolizes the Lord's presence in every person who has charity; it refers both to those coming out of the ark and to every wild animal of the earth, that is, to people inside the church and to people outside the church. This can be seen from the remarks just above.<br />The Lord also enters into a pact with people outside the church, called "Gentiles"{*1} — that is, he binds himself to them through charity. This is the situation: People who belong to the church suppose that none of those outside the church, called Gentiles, can be saved, because they lack any knowledge of the faith and are therefore totally ignorant of the Lord.{*2} Church members say that without the faith and without any knowledge of the Lord there is no salvation. So they consign everyone outside the church to damnation. In fact many of these church members are the kind of people who subscribe to a doctrine (even a heretical one) that teaches them to consider anyone outside it — anyone whose opinion differs from theirs — incapable of salvation. The reality, however, is entirely different.<br />[2] The Lord has mercy on the whole human race. He wants to save everyone in the entire world and to draw all people to himself. The Lord's mercy is infinite; it does not allow itself to be restricted to the few within the church but reaches out to everyone on the face of the earth. When people are born outside the church and as a result into ignorance about the faith, it is not their fault; besides which, failure to believe in the Lord because of a lack of knowledge about him never condemns anyone.<br />What right-thinking person would ever assert that most of the human race will suffer eternal death because they were not born in Europe, whose population is relatively small? What right-thinking person would say that the Lord allowed such an immense number of people to be born in order to die an eternal death? This would be contrary to the divine nature and to mercy. What is more, people outside the church, called Gentiles, live a much more ethical life than those inside the church and embrace teachings of the genuine faith much more easily.<br />[3] Souls in the other world illustrate this even more clearly. The so-called Christian world yields up the worst of all — people who nurse a murderous hatred for their fellow humans and for the Lord and who are more adulterous than any others in the whole earth. Not so with souls from the other parts of the planet. A large number of those who had worshiped idols are disposed to abhor hatred and adultery and to fear Christians, since Christians are hateful and adulterous and want to hurt everyone else.<br />Non-Christians, in fact, are such that when angels teach them the truth of the faith and tell them that the Lord governs the universe, they easily pick it up, easily absorb the faith, and as a consequence reject their idols.{*3} So non-Christians who have lived a moral life marked by charity for one another and by innocence are reborn in the other life. While they live in the world, the Lord is present with them in their charity and innocence, because not a whit of charity or innocence exists that does not come from the Lord.<br />The Lord also gives them the gift of a conscience for what is right and good, according to their religious tradition, and into this conscience he instills innocence and neighborly love. When innocence and neighborly love reside in their conscience, they allow themselves to absorb easily the truth of genuine faith that grows out of goodness. The Lord himself said the same thing in Luke:<br />Someone said to Jesus, "Lord, are there few who are saved?" He told them, "You will see Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob and all the prophets in God's kingdom but will see yourselves thrown out of doors. On the other hand, from the east and west and from the north and from the south will come those reclining [at table] in God's kingdom. And indeed there are people in the last place who will be first, and there are people in first place who will be last."

[LHC]<br />{*2} Throughout this passage, Swedenborg is rejecting a charge leveled against Christianity by its contemporary opponents. The Christian religion was revealed by God to certain individuals; and as a result, knowledge of it is not universal, but restricted to specific groups and locations. (This notion is sometimes critically referred to as "the scandal of particularity.") Inevitably, then, millions of human beings are born in regions in which knowledge of the Christian faith simply is not available. Christianity of Swedenborg's time, both Roman Catholic and Protestant, explicitly excluded these people from being saved — that is, from living happily in the next world; but as the English Deist Matthew Tindal (1657-1733) asked, how was it "consistent with the notion of God's being universally benevolent, not to have revealed [the truth of the Christian religion] to all his children, when all had equal need of it? Was it not as easy for him to have communicated it to all nations, as to any one nation or person? Or in all languages, as in one?" (Tindal 1730, 196). Such criticism gained momentum from the ongoing exploration of the world and the widening of the European cultural viewpoint after the late Renaissance period. It was one motivation behind the intense Enlightenment interest in "natural," as opposed to divinely revealed, religion: natural religion promised a universally valid faith arising purely out of human interaction with creation; it did not depend on local and limited revelations of truth. One Christian apologist, Hugo Grotius (1583-1645), countered this criticism of Christianity by listing the many lands into which the religion had spread and asking, "What religion is there that can compare with it for the extent of its possession?" (Grotius [1639] 1829, 117-118). An English polemicist, William Law (1686-1761), took another tack, saying that revelation was mercifully withheld by God from some nations because they were "prepared only to have their guilt increased by it, and so be exposed to a greater damnation by refusing it" (Law [1731] 1892, 96). Swedenborg's theology renders the criticism moot: he asserts that even people not acquainted with Christian revelation can be saved as long as they have lived a moral life on earth. He makes this assertion as early as his 1734 work The Infinite <a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_1032/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_14" target=_top>14</a> (Swedenborg [1734] 1965, 125-127).

And I will establish my covenant with you. That this signifies the presence of the Lord with all who have charity, and refers to those who go forth from the ark and to every wild animal of the earth, 
that is, to men within the church and men without, is evident from what has been said just above. That the Lord enters into a covenant, or conjoins Himself by charity, with Gentiles also who are outside 
the church, shall now be shown. The man of the church supposes that all who are out of the church, and are called Gentiles, cannot be saved, because they have no knowledges of faith, and are therefore 
wholly ignorant of the Lord, saying that without faith and without knowledge of the Lord there is no salvation, and thus he condemns all who are out of the church. Indeed many of this sort who are 
in some doctrine, even if it be heresy, suppose that all outside this, that is, all who do not hold the same opinion, cannot be saved; when in fact the case is not so at all. The Lord has mercy toward 
the whole human race, and wills to save and draw to Himself all who are in the universe.  [2] The mercy of the Lord is infinite, and does not suffer itself to be limited to those few who are within 
the church, but extends itself to all in the whole world. Their being born out of the church and being thus in ignorance of faith, is not their fault; and no one is ever condemned for not having faith 
in the Lord when he is ignorant of Him. Who that thinks aright will ever say that the greatest part of the human race must perish in eternal death because they were not born in Europe, where there 
are comparatively few? And who that thinks aright will say that the Lord suffered so great a multitude to be born to perish in eternal death? This would be contrary to the Divine, and contrary to mercy. 
And besides, those who are out of the church, and are called Gentiles, live a much more moral life than those who are within the church, and embrace much more easily the doctrine of true faith, as 
is still more evident from souls in the other life. The worst of all come from the so-called Christian world, holding the neighbor in deadly hatred, and even the Lord. Above all others in the whole world 
they are adulterers.  [3] It is not so with those from other parts of the world. Very many of those who have worshiped idols are of such a disposition as to abhor hatred and adultery, and to fear 
Christians because of their being of this character and desirous of tormenting everyone. Indeed Gentiles are so disposed as to listen readily, when taught by angels about the truths of faith, and that 
the Lord rules the universe, and to be easily imbued with faith and thus to reject their idols. For this reason Gentiles who have lived a moral life and in mutual charity and innocence, are regenerated 
in the other life. While they live in the world the Lord is present with them in charity and innocence, for there is nothing of charity and innocence except from the Lord. The Lord also gives them 
a conscience of what is right and good according to their religion, and insinuates innocence and charity into that conscience; and when there is innocence and charity in the conscience, they easily suffer 
themselves to be imbued with the truth of faith from good. The Lord Himself said this, in Luke: </p>
<p>     And one said unto Him, Lord, are they few that be saved? and He said unto them, Ye shall see 
Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob, and all the prophets, in the kingdom of God, and yourselves cast forth without; and they shall come from the east and the west, and from the north and from the south, and shall 
sit down in the kingdom of God; and behold, there are last who shall be first, and there are first who shall be last (Luke 13:23, 28-30). By "Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob" are here meant all who have 
love, as shown above. </p>

<p align="center"><b>Elliott(1983-1999) 1032</b></p><p><b>1032.</b>
That 'and I will establish My covenant with you' means the Lord's presence with all people who have charity, and refers to 'those going out of the ark' and to 'every wild animal of the earth', that is, 
to people inside the Church and to those outside of it, is clear from what has been stated just above. With regard to the Lord also entering into a covenant with, that is, joining Himself by means 
of charity to people outside of the Church who are called gentiles, the position is this: The member of the Church imagines that all outside of the Church who are called gentiles cannot be saved because 
they do not possess any cognitions of faith and do not therefore know the Lord at all. Churchmen say that without faith and without knowledge of the Lord there is no salvation, and so all who are outside 
of the Church stand condemned. Indeed many such persons possessing some doctrine, even those embracing heresy, imagine that all outside of the Church, that is, all who do not feel as they do, are 
not saved. But the reality is altogether different. The Lord has mercy towards the whole human race, and wishes to save and draw to Himself all people throughout the universe. </p>
<p></p>
<p><b>[2]</b>
 The Lord's mercy 
is infinite and will not let itself be limited to the few who are inside the Church. Instead it reaches out to all in the whole wide world. No one can be blamed because he has been born outside of 
the Church and so has no knowledge of matters of faith. Nor is anybody in any way condemned for having no faith in the Lord because he does not know Him. What right-thinking person is ever going to say 
that the greater part of the human race will perish in eternal death just because they have not been born in Europe whose inhabitants are relatively few? And what right-thinking person is going to say 
that the Lord would allow such a large number of people to be born so as to perish in eternal death? That would be contrary to the Divine and contrary to mercy. And in any case people outside of the 
Church, called gentiles, lead a far more upright life than those inside the Church do, and they embrace far more readily that which true faith teaches. This matter becomes clearer still from souls in 
the next life. </p>
<p></p>
<p><b>[3]</b>
 From the so-called Christian world come the worst people of all, those in whom deadly hatred of the neighbour and deadly hatred of the Lord prevail. More than anybody else in the 
whole world they are adulterers. But this is not true of all other parts of the world; for a large number of those who have worshipped idols have an attitude of mind that finds hatred and adultery 
abhorrent, and they fear Christians for being such and for wishing to subject everybody else to torture. Indeed gentiles are such that when taught by angels about truths of faith and that the Lord rules 
over all, they have no difficulty in listening and have no difficulty in being endued with faith, and so casting aside their idols. Consequently those gentiles who have led an upright life, and have 
done so in mutual charity and in innocence, are regenerated in the next life. While they are living in the world the Lord is present with them in their charity and innocence, for no charity or innocence 
exists at all except that which comes from the Lord. The Lord also confers on them, according to the religion they have, a conscience for what is right and good, and instills innocence and charity 
into that conscience. And when innocence and charity exist in conscience they allow themselves without difficulty to be endued with the truth of faith deriving from good. The Lord Himself has said all 
this in Luke, </p>
<blockquote>
Someone said to Jesus, Lord, are those who are saved few? He said to them, You will see Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob, and all the prophets in the kingdom of God, but you yourselves thrust 
out. On the other hand men will come from the east and from the west, and from the north and from the south, and sit at table in the kingdom of God. And, behold, some are last who will be first, 
and some are first who will be last. <a href="http://bible.gospelcom.net/cgi-bin/bible?passage=Luke%2013:23,%2028-30&amp;version=ESV&amp;interface=print&amp;showfn=yes&amp;showxref">Luke 13:23, 28-30</a>. 
</blockquote>
<p>'Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob' here are used to mean all who dwell in love, as shown already. </p>
