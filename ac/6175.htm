<h3 align="center" class="ired">属天的奥秘 第6175节</h3>
<h4 align="center"></h4><p><strong>6175.</strong>“雅各的日子，他一生的岁数是一百四十七岁”表总体的状态及其性质。如果将数字“七”、“四十”和“一百”的含义解开，这一点是显而易见的。至于“七”表示什么，可参看前文（<a href="395.htm">395</a>，<a href="433.htm">433</a>，<a href="716.htm">716</a>，<a href="728.htm">728</a>，<a href="881.htm">881</a>，<a href="5265.htm">5265</a>，<a href="5268.htm">5268</a>节）；“四十”表示什么（<a href="730.htm">730</a>，<a href="862.htm">862</a>，<a href="2272.htm">2272</a>，<a href="2273.htm">2273</a>节）；“一百”表示什么（<a href="1988.htm">1988</a>，<a href="2636.htm">2636</a>，<a href="4400.htm">4400</a>节）。不过，要解释这些数字的和却不容易，因为它们所包含的事物远远超出任何人所能清楚计算或解释的。一般来说，这些数字包含了“雅各”所代表的实物的整体状态及其性质。天使通过一百四十七这个数字能在一个整体中看见这些事物；因为对天使来说，圣言中的所有数字都会转化为关于属灵实物的观念。这一点也通过以下事实向我清楚显明：有好几次，一长串数字出现在我面前；每当它们出现时，天使都会告诉我，这些数字依次含有他们正在彼此谈论的实物在里面。此外，这解释了为何属于属天教会的上古之人也有一种数字计算方法，用来表达几乎无法以属世心智的观念来理解的天上事物。但是，他们的时代过后，这些计算方法，连同对天上事物的觉知都一道灭亡了。所存留下来的，只是有关几个简单数字的一般含义的知识，如“三”、“六”、“七”、“十二”；而存留下来的有关复合数含义的知识却不多。然而如今，就连圣言中的数字除了表示数字外，还表示某种事物也不为人知了；因此，关于该主题所说的这些话，恐怕也被视为难以置信了。</p>

So the days of Jacob, the years of his life, were seven years and a hundred and forty years. That this signifies the general state and its quality, may be seen if the numbers "seven," "forty," and a 
"hundred" are unfolded. What "seven" signifies may be seen above (n. 395, 433, 716, 728, 881, 5265, 5268); what "forty" signifies (n. 730, 862, 2272, 2273); and what a "hundred" (n. 1988, 2636, 4400). 
But the numbers thus compounded cannot be easily unfolded, for they contain more things than can be reduced to a summary statement, and be expressed to the apprehension. These numbers in general contain 
the whole state of that which is represented by Jacob, and its quality. These things the angels see in one complex from the very number a hundred and forty-seven; for all numbers in the Word fall 
with them into ideas of things, as has been made plain to me from the fact that sometimes numbers in a long succession have appeared to me, and the angels then said that those numbers enfolded within 
them in succession likewise the things of which they were conversing. From this also the most ancient people, who were of the celestial church, made a computation consisting of numbers, by which were 
conveyed heavenly things not easily comprehensible to the ideas of the natural mind. But after their times these computations perished, together with the perception of heavenly things, and there remained 
only the knowledge of the general signification of the simple numbers, as "three," "six," "seven," "twelve;" and not so much of the signification of compound numbers. But at this day it is not known 
that the numbers in the Word signify anything except number, and therefore what has been said on the subject will perhaps be thought incredible. </p>

'And the days of Jacob, the years of his life, were a hundred and forty-seven years means the state in general and its essential nature. This becomes clear if the meaning of the numbers seven, forty, 
and a hundred is brought out.<A name="fntext1"></a><A href="#fn1"><sup>a</sup></a> For what seven means, see <a href="395.htm">395</a>, <a href="433.htm">433</a>, <a href="716.htm">716</a>, <a href="728.htm">728</a>, <a href="881.htm">881</a>, <a href="5165.htm">5165</a>, <a href="5268.htm">5268</a>; for what forty means, <a href="730.htm">730</a>, <a href="862.htm">862</a>, <a href="2272.htm">2272</a>, <a href="2273.htm">2273</a>; and for what a hundred means, <a href="1988.htm">1988</a>, <a href="1636.htm">1636</a>, <a href="4400.htm">4400</a> But no easy explanation 
of the sum of these numbers is possible, for they contain far more than anyone can calculate or explain intelligibly. In general these numbers contain the entire state of the reality represented 
by 'Jacob' and its essential nature. The angels can see these things in their entirety simply from that number; they can do so because with the angels all numbers in the Word pass into ideas about 
spiritual realities. This has also been made evident to me by the fact that on several occasions a long sequence of numbers has appeared in front of me, and whenever they have appeared the angels have 
told me that the numbers held, in sequence, the realities which they were talking about to one another. This in addition explains why the most ancient people who belonged to the celestial Church also 
had a way of calculating that consisted of numbers employed to express heavenly things which could barely be understood by the use of ideas in the natural mind. But after those people's times such 
evaluations perished, along with the perception of heavenly things. All that remained was a knowledge of the general meaning of the simple numbers, such as three, six, seven, and twelve, but not much 
knowledge of the meaning of compound numbers. At the present day however even the idea that numbers in the Word mean something more than their numerical values is quite unknown, and therefore the idea 
will probably be treated as one of those that are unbelievable.

`Et fuit dies Jacobi anni vitae {1}illius septem anni et  quadraginta et centum anni': quod significet statum communem et quale ejus, constare potest si evolvantur numeri septem, quadraginta et centum; 
quid septem, videatur n. 395, 433, 716, 728, 881, 5265,  5268; quid quadraginta, n. (x)730, 862, 2272, 2273; et quid centum,  n. 1988, 2636, 4400; at numeri ita compositi non facile explicari possunt, 
nam plura continent quam ut in summam redigi queant et ad captum exprimi; hi numeri in communi integrum statum rei per `Jacobum' repraesentatae et ejus quale continent; haec angeli vident in uno 
complexu solum a numero illo; nam omnes numeri in Verbo cadunt apud illos in ideas rerum; quod etiam patuit ex eo quod aliquoties numeri in longa serie mihi visi sint, et tunc ab angelis dictum quod involvant 
res in serie, de quibus inter se locuti sunt; inde quoque antiquissimi qui ab Ecclesia caelesti fuerunt, computum habuerunt etiam ex numeris constantem quibus res caelestes non ideis mentis naturalis 
ita comprehensibiles illatae sunt; sed haec post illorum tempora cum caelestium perceptione perierunt, remanente solum cognitione quid in communi significarent numeri simplices, sicut tres, sex, 
septem, duodecim, non ita quid numeri compositi; sed hodie nec scitur quod numeri in Verbo aliquid praeter numerum significent, quare hoc inter incredibilia forte erit. @1 see p. 496, ftnote I$ </p>
