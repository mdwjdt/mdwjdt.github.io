<h3 align="center" class="ired">属天的奥秘 第8624节</h3>
<h4 align="center"></h4><p><strong>8624.</strong>“给它起名叫耶和华尼西”表持续的战争，以及主的保护，以免受那些沉浸于内层邪恶所生虚假之人的伤害。这从以下事实清楚可知，在教会，古人所取的名字表示当时讨论中的事物的性质和状态，他们还将这些事物包括在名字本身里面（参看<a href="340.htm">340</a>，<a href="1946.htm">1946</a>，<a href="3422.htm">3422</a>，<a href="4298.htm">4298</a>节）。此处所论述之事的性质和状态是，耶和华将世世代代与亚玛力争战；在内义上是，与那些沉浸于内层邪恶所生的虚假之人的争战将持续不断地进行；“耶和华尼西”也表示这一点。在原文，“耶和华尼西”表示“耶和华是我的旌旗或军旗”；在圣言中，“旌旗或军旗”表示集合作战的号召。由于经上说“耶和华争战”，故所表示祂所给予的保护。<br />“旌旗或军旗”表示集合作战的号召，这一点从以下事实明显可知：当当他们被号召集合时，无论是启程，守节，还是去打仗，他们都会吹号角，同时还在山上竖起旌旗或军旗。至于他们吹号，可参看民数记（<a href="http://39-27.cn/民10.1.htm">10:1</a>-<a href="http://39-27.cn/民10.11.htm">11</a>）； 他们竖起一面旌旗或军旗，这从以下经文明显看出来：<br />你们要在犹大宣告，使人在耶路撒冷听见说，你们要在地中吹号角，高声呼叫说，你们要集合起来，我们好进入坚固城！要向锡安竖起旌旗，要集合，不要迟延！（耶利米书<a href="http://39-27.cn/耶4.5.htm">4:5</a>，<a href="http://39-27.cn/耶4.6.htm">6</a>）<br />以赛亚书：<br />世上一切的居民和地上所住的人哪，竖立旌旗的时候，你们要看！吹角的时候，你们要听！（以赛亚书<a href="http://39-27.cn/赛18.3.htm">18:3</a>）<br /><br />祂必竖起旌旗，招远方的列族，发嘶声叫他从地极而来！看哪，他必急速奔来。（以赛亚书<a href="http://39-27.cn/赛5.26.htm">5:26</a>）<br /><br />你们要在高山上竖起旌旗，向他们扬声招手，叫他们进入首领之门。（以赛亚书<a href="http://39-27.cn/赛13.2.htm">13:2</a>）<br /><br />主耶和华如此说，看哪，我必向列族举手，向万民竖起我的旌旗，他们必将你的众子怀中抱来，将你的众女肩上扛来。（以赛亚书<a href="http://39-27.cn/赛49.22.htm">49:22</a>）<br />从这些经文明显可知“旌旗或军旗”表示集合起来。<br />“旌旗或军旗”当论及主时，还表示保护，这一点明显可见于以下经文：<br />人从日落之处必敬畏耶和华的名；从日出之地，也必敬畏祂的荣耀。因为祂必像狭急的河流冲来；耶和华的灵必竖起反对他的旌旗；必有一位救赎主来到锡安。（以赛亚书<a href="http://39-27.cn/赛59.19.htm">59:19</a>，<a href="http://39-27.cn/赛59.20.htm">20</a>）<br /><br />到那日，耶西的根立作万民的旌旗，列族必寻求祂，祂的安息必大有荣耀。（以赛亚书<a href="http://39-27.cn/赛11.10.htm">11:10</a>）<br />由于在原文，“军旗”和“旌旗”用的是同一词，都表示集合起来，并且当论及主时，也表示保护，所以经上明确吩咐，要把在一条铜蛇挂在旗杆上；对此，我们在摩西五经中读到：<br />耶和华对摩西说，你制造一条蛇，挂在旗杆上，凡被咬的，一望这蛇，就必得活。摩西便制造一条铜蛇，挂在旗杆上，蛇若咬了什么人，那人一望这铜蛇，就又活了。（民数记<a href="http://39-27.cn/民21.8.htm">21:8</a>，<a href="http://39-27.cn/民21.9.htm">9</a>）<br />铜蛇代表主（参看约翰福音<a href="http://39-27.cn/约3.14.htm">3:14</a>，<a href="http://39-27.cn/约3.15.htm">15</a>）；它还表示保护，这是显而易见的；因为通过望挂在旗杆上的蛇来得医治表示通过仰望对主的信而从虚假所生的邪恶中得医治。因为主在从约翰福音中所引用的上述经文中说：<br />摩西在旷野怎样举蛇，人子也必照样被举起来；叫一切信祂的，不至灭亡，反得永生。（约翰福音<a href="http://39-27.cn/约3.14.htm">3:14</a>，<a href="http://39-27.cn/约3.15.htm">15</a>）</p>

And called the name of it Jehovah-nissi. That this signifies continual warfare, and the Lord's protection, against those who are in the falsity of interior evil, is evident from the fact that the names 
bestowed by the ancients in the church signified the quality and the state of the thing then in question, and these they also wrapped up in the very names (see n. 340, 1946, 3422, 4298). The quality 
and the state of the thing here treated of is that Jehovah would have war against Amalek from generation to generation; in the internal sense, that there should be perpetual war against those who are 
in the falsity of interior evil; this also is signified by "Jehovah-nissi." In the original tongue "Jehovah-nissi" means "Jehovah my banner," or "ensign," and by "an ensign," or "banner," in the Word 
is signified a calling together for war; and as it is said that "Jehovah shall have war," protection by Him is also signified. [2] That by "a banner" or "ensign" is signified a calling together for 
war, is evident from the fact that when they were called together, whether for journeyings, or for festivals, or for war, they sounded a trumpet, and then also lifted up an ensign or banner upon the 
mountains. That they sounded a trumpet see Numbers 10:1-11; that they lifted up an ensign or banner see the following passages: </p>
<p>     Declare ye in Judah, and make it heard in Jerusalem, and say, and 
blow ye the trumpet in the land, proclaim, fill full, say, Gather yourselves together, and let us enter into the defensed cities, set up a banner toward Zion, assemble yourselves, stay not (Jer. 4:5, 
6).      All ye inhabitants of the world, and ye dwellers on the earth, when a banner is lifted up, see ye; and when a trumpet is sounded, hear ye (Isa. 18:3).      He hath lifted up a banner to the 
nations from far, and hath hissed for him from the extremity of the earth; and behold he shall come with speed swiftly (Isa. 5:26).      Lift ye up a banner upon the lofty mountain, lift up the voice 
unto them, wave the hand, that they may come to the gate of the princes (Isa. 13:2).      Thus said the Lord Jehovih, Behold I will lift up My hand toward the nations, and set up My banner to the peoples; 
and they shall bring thy sons in their bosom, and thy daughters they shall carry upon their shoulder (Isa. 49:22). From these passages it is plain that by "a banner" is signified a gathering 
together. [3] That "a banner" or "ensign," when predicated of the Lord, signifies also protection, is evident in these passages: </p>
<p>     They shall fear the name of Jehovah from the west, and His glory 
from the rising of the sun; because it will come as a pent-up stream, the spirit of Jehovah shall lift up a banner against him; then shall the Redeemer come to Zion (Isa. 59:19).      It shall come 
to pass in that day that the root of Jesse, which standeth for a banner of the people, shall the nations seek; and his rest shall be glory (Isa. 11:10). [4] Inasmuch as "an ensign" which in the original 
tongue is expressed by the same term as "a banner," signified a gathering together, and when said of the Lord, protection also, therefore it was expressly commanded that a brazen serpent should be 
set upon an ensign, of which we read in Moses: </p>
<p>     Jehovah said unto Moses, Make thee a serpent, and set it upon an ensign; and it shall come to pass that everyone that is bitten, and looketh at it, 
shall live. And Moses made a serpent of brass, and set it upon an ensign; whence it came to pass that if a serpent had bitten a man, and he looked at the serpent of brass, he lived again (Num. 21:8, 
9). That the brazen serpent represented the Lord, see John 3:14, 15; that it also signified protection, is plain; for the healing effected by looking on the serpent that was on the ensign signified 
healing from evils of falsity by the looking of faith to the Lord. For the Lord says in the passage as quoted from John: </p>
<p>     As Moses lifted up the serpent in the wilderness, so must the Son of man 
be lifted up; that whosoever believeth in Him may not perish, but may have eternal life (John 3:14, 15). </p>

<p align="center"><b>Elliott(1983-1999) 8624</b></p><p><b>8624.</b>
'And called the name of it Jehovah Nissi' means constant warfare and the Lord's protection against those steeped in falsity arising from interior evil. This is clear from the fact that the ancients in 
the Church gave names to indicate the essential nature and the state of whatever matter was under consideration then, and that also they included those things in the names themselves, <a href="340.htm">340</a>, <a href="1946.htm">1946</a>, <a href="3422.htm">3422</a>, <a href="4298.htm">4298</a>. The nature and state of the matter under consideration here is that the war of Jehovah will be against Amalek from generation to generation, in the internal sense that war will be waged unceasingly 
against those steeped in falsity arising from interior evil. This is also meant by 'Jehovah Nissi'. In the original language Jehovah Nissi means Jehovah is my Banner or Standard, and 'standard' 
or 'banner' in the Word means a call to assemble for war. And because the words 'the war of Jehovah' are used, protection given by Him is also meant. </p>
<p></p>
<p><b>[2]</b>
 That 'banner' or 'standard ' means a call 
to assemble for war is clear from the consideration that whenever the people were called to assemble, whether they were going to make journeys, celebrate feasts, or go to war, they sounded the trumpet 
and at the same time also lifted up a standard or banner on the mountains. For their sounding the trumpet, see <a href="http://bible.gospelcom.net/cgi-bin/bible?passage=Num%2010:1-11&amp;version=ESV&amp;interface=print&amp;showfn=yes&amp;showxref">Num 10:1-11</a>; and the fact that they lifted up a standard or banner is evident from the 
following places: In Jeremiah, </p>
<p>Declare in Judah and cause to be heard in Jerusalem, and say, sounding the trumpet in the land, Proclaim, blow loudly,<A name="fntext1"></a><A href="#fn1"><sup>a</sup></a> and say, Gather together, and let us go into the 
fortified cities Raise a banner towards Zion; assemble, do not stop <a href="http://bible.gospelcom.net/cgi-bin/bible?passage=Jer%204:5,%206&amp;version=ESV&amp;interface=print&amp;showfn=yes&amp;showxref">Jer 4:5, 6</a>. </p>
<p>In Isaiah, </p>
<blockquote>
O all inhabitants of the world and dwellers on earth, when the banner is lifted up, look; and when 
the trumpet is sounded, hear. <a href="http://bible.gospelcom.net/cgi-bin/bible?passage=Isa%2018:3&amp;version=ESV&amp;interface=print&amp;showfn=yes&amp;showxref">Isa 18:3</a> 
</blockquote>
<p>In the same prophet, </p>
<blockquote>
He has lifted up a banner to the nations from afar, and whistled to him from the furthest end of the earth; and behold, he will come 
swiftly, with speed <a href="http://bible.gospelcom.net/cgi-bin/bible?passage=Isa%205:26&amp;version=ESV&amp;interface=print&amp;showfn=yes&amp;showxref">Isa 5:26</a>. 
</blockquote>
<p>In the same prophet, </p>
<blockquote>
On a tall mountain lift up the banner, raise your voice to them, wave your hand, that they may come to the gate of the princes. <a href="http://bible.gospelcom.net/cgi-bin/bible?passage=Isa%2013:2&amp;version=ESV&amp;interface=print&amp;showfn=yes&amp;showxref">Isa 13:2</a>. 
</blockquote>
<p>In 
the same prophet, </p>
<blockquote>
Thus said the Lord Jehovih, behold, I will lift up My hand towards the nations, and lift up My banner towards the peoples, that they may bring your sons in their bosom and carry 
your daughters on their shoulder. <a href="http://bible.gospelcom.net/cgi-bin/bible?passage=Isa%2049:22&amp;version=ESV&amp;interface=print&amp;showfn=yes&amp;showxref">Isa 49:22</a>. 
</blockquote>
<p>From all these places it is evident that 'a banner' means an assembling together.  </p>
<p></p>
<p><b>[3]</b>
 The fact that 'a banner' or 'a standard', when used in reference 
to the Lord, also means protection is clear in Isaiah, </p>
<blockquote>
They will fear the name of Jehovah from the setting, and His glory from the rising of the sun, because He will come like a narrow stream. 
The spirit of Jehovah will raise a banner against him; then the Redeemer will come to Zion. <a href="http://bible.gospelcom.net/cgi-bin/bible?passage=Isa%2059:19,%2020&amp;version=ESV&amp;interface=print&amp;showfn=yes&amp;showxref">Isa 59:19, 20</a>. 
</blockquote>
<p>In the same prophet, </p>
<blockquote>
It will happen on that day, that the nations will seek the root of 
Jesse, who is standing as a banner of the peoples; and His rest will be glory. <a href="http://bible.gospelcom.net/cgi-bin/bible?passage=Isa%2011:10&amp;version=ESV&amp;interface=print&amp;showfn=yes&amp;showxref">Isa 11:10</a>. 
</blockquote>
<p></p>
<p><b>[4]</b>
 Since a standard, for which the original language uses the same word as that used for a banner, meant 
an assembling together, and when spoken of in reference to the Lord also meant protection, it was explicitly commanded that the bronze serpent should be set on a standard. This is recorded in Moses 
as follows, </p>
<blockquote>
Jehovah said to Moses, Make a serpent and set it on a standard; and it will happen, that everyone who has been bitten, when he has looked at it, will live. And Moses made a serpent of bronze 
and set it on a standard. So it happened, if a serpent had bitten a man, when he looked at the serpent of bronze, that he was restored to life again. <a href="http://bible.gospelcom.net/cgi-bin/bible?passage=Num%2021:8,%209&amp;version=ESV&amp;interface=print&amp;showfn=yes&amp;showxref">Num 21:8, 9</a>. 
</blockquote>
<p>'The bronze serpent' represented 
the Lord, see <a href="http://bible.gospelcom.net/cgi-bin/bible?passage=John%203:14,%2015&amp;version=ESV&amp;interface=print&amp;showfn=yes&amp;showxref">John 3:14, 15</a>. The fact that it also meant protection is self-evident; for the healing effected by looking at the serpent on the standard meant healing from evils arising from falsity, 
effected by looking to faith in the Lord. For the Lord says in John, in the above mentioned verses, </p>
<p>As Moses lifted up the serpent in the wilderness, so must the Son of Man be lifted up, that 
everyone who believes in Him may not perish but have eternal life.

`Et vocavit nomen ejus Jehovah Nissi': quod significet bellum continuum et tutelam Domini contra illos qui in falso mali interioris, constat ex eo quod nomina quae ab antiquis in Ecclesia indebantur 
significaverint quale et statum rei de qua tunc agebatur, {1}et quod quoque involverint eadem ipsis nominibus, n. 340, 1946, 3422, 3498; quale et status rei de qua hic agitur, est quod bellum Jehovae 
erit contra Amalekum a generatione in generationem, in sensu interno, quod bellum perpetuum erit contra illos qui in falso mali interioris; hoc quoque significatur per `Jehovah Nissi'; Jehovah Nissi 
in lingua originali significat Jehovah vexillum seu signum meum, et per `signum' aut `vexillum' in Verbo significatur convocatio ad bellum; et quia dicitur `bellum Jehovae,' significatur etiam tutela 
ab Ipso. 	2 Quod per vexillum seu signum significetur convocatio ad bellum, constat ex eo quod cum convocationes {2}fierent, sive ad profectiones, sive ad festa, sive ad bellum, {3} clanxerint buccina, 
{4}et (x)tunc quoque sustulerint signum seu vexillum super montibus; quod clanxerint buccina, videatur Num. x 1-11; quod sustulerint signum seu vexillum, ex his locis: apud Jeremiam, Annuntiate in 
Jehuda, et in Hierosolyma audiri facite, et dicite, et clangite buccina in terra, proclamate, implete, dicite, congregamini, {5}et intremus in urbes munimenti, erigite vexillum Zionem versus, convenite, 
ne subsistite, iv 5, 6: </p>
<p>apud Esaiam, Omnes habitatores orbis, et incolae terrae, quando tolletur vexillum, aspicite, et cum clangitur buccina, audite, xviii 3: </p>
<p>apud eundem, Sustulit vexillum gentibus 
e longinquo, et sibilavit illi ab extremitate terrae; et ecce cito velox adveniet, v 26: </p>
<p>apud eundem, Super monte eminente tollite vexillum, extollite vocem illis, agitate manum, ut veniant 
portae principum, xiii 2: </p>
<p>apud eundem, Sic dixit Dominus Jehovih, Ecce tollam erga gentes manum Meam, et erga populos attollam vexillum Meum, ut adferant filios tuos in sinu, et filias tuas super umero 
apportent, xlix 22; </p>
<p>ex his patet quod per `vexillum' significetur {6}congregatio. 	3 Quod vexillum seu signum cum praedicatur de Domino, significet etiam tutelam, constat apud Esaiam, {7}Timebunt 
ab occasu nomen Jehovae, et ab ortu solis gloriam Ipsius, quia veniet sicut flumen angustum; spiritus Jehovae vexillum eriget in illo; tunc veniet Zioni Redemptor, lix 19 [, 20]: </p>
<p>apud eundem, Fiet 
in die illo, radicem Jischaii, qui stans in vexillum populorum, gentes quaerent: et erit (x)quies Ipsius gloria, xi 10. 	4 {8}Quia signum, quod in lingua originali exprimitur eadem voce qua vexillum, 
significabat congregationem, et cum dicebatur de Domino etiam tutelam, ideo expresse mandatum est ut serpens aeneus poneretur super signo, de quo ita apud Moschen, Dixit Jehovah ad Moschen, Fac tibi 
serpentem, et pone eum super signum; et fiet, omnis qui morsus fuerit et aspexerit illum vivet; et fecit Moscheh serpentem aeris, et posuit eum super signum; unde factum est, si momordit serpens virum 
et aspexit serpentem aeris, revixit, Num. xxi 8, 9; </p>
<p>quod `serpens aeneus' repraesentaverit Dominum, videatur Joh. iii 14, 15; quod etiam tutelam, patet; nam sanatio per inspectionem serpentis qui 
super signo, significabat sanationem a malis falsi per inspectionem fidei in Dominum; dicit enim Dominus in loco citato apud Johannem, Sicut Moscheh exaltavit serpentem in deserto, ita oportet exaltari 
Filium hominis, ut omnis qui credit in Ipsum non pereat sed vitam aeternam habeat. 	@1 After 4298$ 	@2 fiebant$ 	@3 i tunc$ 	@4 et signum sustulerint super montibus$ 	@5 ut$ 	@6 congregatio,
