<h3 align="center" class="ired">属天的奥秘 第4182节</h3>
<h4 align="center"></h4><p><strong>4182.</strong>“神看见我的苦情和我手的劳碌，就在昨夜下了判决”表一切皆凭祂自己的能力由祂成就。这从“苦情”和“手的劳碌”的含义清楚可知，“苦情”和“手的劳碌”在此是指试探。由于主通过试探并得胜将神性联结于人身，使这人身也变成神性，并且是凭祂自己的能力这样做的，所以这些话表示这些事。关于主通过试探并得胜将神性联结于人身，并凭祂自己的能力使这人身也变成神性，可参看前文（<a href="1661.htm">1661</a>，<a href="1737.htm">1737</a>，<a href="1813.htm">1813</a>，<a href="1921.htm">1921</a>，<a href="2776.htm">2776</a>，<a href="3318.htm">3318</a>节）；“手掌或手”表示能力（<a href="878.htm">878</a>，<a href="3387.htm">3387</a>节）；因而“我的手掌或手”表示祂自己的能力。“神看见，就下了判决”表示主的神性，因为是在祂里面，并属于祂的神性做了这一切。</p>

God hath seen my misery and the weariness of my hands, and judged yesternight. That this signifies that all things were from Him by His own power, is evident from the signification of "misery," and of 
the "weariness of the hands," as being temptations; and as by temptations and victories the Lord united the Divine to the human, and made this also Divine, and this from His own power, these things 
are signified by the same words. (That by temptations and victories the Lord united the Divine to the Human, and made this Divine by His own power, may be seen above, n. 1661, 1737, 1813, 1921, 2776, 
3318; and also that the "hollow of the hand," or the "hand," is power, n. 878, 3387; consequently that "my palms," or "hands," denote His own power.) "God hath seen, and hath judged," signifies the Lord's 
Divine, in that the Divine which was in Him, and which was His, did it. </p>

<p align="center"><b>Elliott(1983-1999) 4182</b></p><p><b>4182.</b>
'My affliction and the tiredness of my hands God has seen, and has given judgement last night' means that all things were effected by Him by His own power. This is clear from the meaning of 'affliction 
and tiredness of hands' in this case as temptations. And since by temptations and victories the Lord united the Divine to the Human and made the Human Divine too, doing so by His own power, these things 
are therefore meant by these same words. By temptations and victories the Lord united the Divine to the Human, and made the Human Divine by His own power, see <a href="1661.htm">1661</a>, <a href="1737.htm">1737</a>, <a href="1813.htm">1813</a>, <a href="1921.htm">1921</a>, <a href="2776.htm">2776</a>, <a href="3318.htm">3318</a> 
(end). 'Palms or hand means power, <a href="878.htm">878</a>, <a href="3387.htm">3387</a>, and therefore 'my palms' or 'my hands' means one's own power. 'God has seen, and has given judgement' means that the Lord's Divine - the Divine within Him 
and which is His - effected it. </p>

</p><b>4182.</b>
`Miseriam meam et fatigationem volarum mearum vidit Deus, et dijudicavit nocte praeterita': quod significet quod omnia a Ipso propria potentia, constat a significatione `miseriae et fatigationis 
volarum' hic quod sint tentationes; et quia Dominus per tentatione et victorias univit Divinum Humano et Hoc quoque Divinum feci et id ex propria potentia, ideo {1} per eadem haec verba, haec significantur; 
quod Dominus per tentationes et victorias univerit Divinum Humano, et Hoc Divinum fecerit ex propria potentia, videatur n. (x)1661, 1737, 1813, 1921, 2776, 3318 f.; `vola' seu manus quod 
sint potentia, n. 878, 3387, proinde `volae meae' aut manus meae, propria potentia: `vidit Deus, et dijudicavit' significat Divinum Domini, quod nempe Divinum quod in Ipso et quod Ipsius, id fecerit.
