<h3 align="center" class="ired">属天的奥秘 第1063节</h3>
<h4 align="center"></h4><p><strong>1063.</strong>“含是迦南的父亲”表源于败坏教会、缺乏内在的外在敬拜，“迦南”则表这类敬拜。这一点同样从下文清楚可知，因为本节内容是下文的前言。“含”表败坏的教会，即把脱离仁之信当成宗教的主要原则之人，这一点清楚可见于诗篇：<br />祂在埃及击杀一切长子，在含的帐棚中，击杀他们强壮时头生的。（诗篇<a href="http://39-27.cn/诗78.51.htm">78:51</a>）<br />“埃及长子”代表无仁之信。关于信被称为“埃及长子”，可参看前文（<a href="352.htm">352</a>，<a href="367.htm">367</a>节）；关于信因此被称为“强壮时头生的”，可参看创世记（<a href="http://39-27.cn/创49.3.htm">49:3</a>），其中论及吕便（或流便），他是雅各的长子，代表信，被称为“强壮时头生的”。“含的帐棚”是由这种信所产生的敬拜。“帐棚”表敬拜（参看<a href="414.htm">414</a>节）。为此，埃及被称为“含的陆地”（诗篇<a href="http://39-27.cn/诗105.23.htm">105:23</a>，<a href="http://39-27.cn/诗105.27.htm">27</a>；<a href="http://39-27.cn/诗106.22.htm">106:22</a>）。<br />在古教会，这种人被称为“含”，由于其生活由一切恶欲构成，他们喋喋不休地诉说无论生活如何，他们都能因信得救，故在古人看来，他们因着恶欲之热而显得发黑。含被说成是“迦南的父亲”，是因为这种人根本不关心人的生活如何，他只参加宗教仪式，因为他们还有某种敬拜的渴望。对他们来说，外在敬拜是唯一的敬拜；他们拒绝唯独属于仁爱的内在敬拜。这就是为何含被称为“迦南的父亲”。</p>

<p><strong>[NCE]1063.</strong> Ham was the father of Canaan, means that the corrupted church gave rise to an outward show of worship without inward content, such worship being symbolized by Canaan. This too will be seen from what follows, the contents of the current verse being a preface to the next verses.<br />Ham's symbolism as the church corrupted, that is, as those who consider the main element of religion to be faith detached from charity, can be seen in David:<br />He struck every firstborn in Egypt, the beginning of their strength in the tents of Ham. (<a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_1063/bible_king-james-version_psalms_78_51" target=_top>Psalms 78:51</a>)<br />The firstborn of Egypt represented faith devoid of charity. (For the idea that faith is called the church's firstborn, see earlier at <a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_1063/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_352" target=_top>352</a>, <a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_1063/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_367" target=_top>367</a>. That is why faith is called the beginning of strength, as it is here in David; see <a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_1063/bible_king-james-version_genesis_49_3" target=_top>Genesis 49:3</a>, where it is used of Reuben, who as Jacob's firstborn represented faith and is called the beginning of strength.) The tents of Ham are worship based on that faith. (For the symbolism of tents as worship, see prior remarks in <a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_1063/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_414" target=_top>414</a>.) Egypt is consequently called the land of Ham in <a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_1063/bible_king-james-version_psalms_105_23" target=_top>Psalms 105:23</a>, <a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_1063/bible_king-james-version_psalms_105_27" target=_top>27</a>; <a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_1063/bible_king-james-version_psalms_106_22" target=_top>106:22</a>.<br />[2] People like this — referred to as Ham in the ancient church — lived a life devoted to all kinds of cravings, babbling only that their faith could save them no matter how they lived. In ancient eyes they accordingly looked black, from the searing heat of their passions, which is why they were called Ham.{*1} The reason the verse describes Ham as the father of Canaan is that such individuals do not care how one lives as long as one attends religious functions. They do still want some kind of worship. Outward worship is the only kind they have; inward worship, which has exclusively to do with charity, they reject. That is why Ham is called the father of Canaan.<br /><br /><strong>Footnotes:</strong><br />{*1} Swedenborg is identifying the name Ham with a Hebrew adjective spelled the same way (חַם [ḥam]) and meaning "hot," as Elliott points out (Swedenborg [1749-1756] 1983-1999). Swedenborg also seems to be drawing a connection to the traditional description of black Africans as descendants of Ham (see note 1 in <a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_1063/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_1062" target=_top>1062</a>). He does occasionally refer to spirits as black without reference to race, however, and his view of African spirituality is in general positive, in contrast to the characterization of the people called Ham here. On Africans, see, for example, <a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_1063/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_814#subsection-2-2" target=_top>814:2</a> and the comment in note 2 in <a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_1063/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_813" target=_top>813</a>.

And Ham is the father of Canaan. That this signifies that from the corrupted church sprang worship in externals without internals, which worship is signified by "Canaan" is likewise evident from what 
follows; for what is contained in this verse is premised to what is in the following verses. That "Ham" signifies the corrupted church, that is, those who make faith separate from charity the principal 
of their faith, is evident in David: </p>
<p>     He smote all the firstborn in Egypt, the beginning of strength, in the tents of Ham (Ps. 78:51). By "the firstborn in Egypt" was represented faith without 
charity. That faith is called the firstborn of the church may be seen above (n. 352, 367); and that faith is thence called the "beginning of strength" as here in David, may be seen in Genesis (49:3), 
in what is said of Reuben, who represented faith because he was the firstborn of Jacob, and is called the "beginning of strength." The "tents of Ham" are the worship therefrom. That "tents" signify 
worship may be seen above (n. 414). Egypt is hence called the "land of Ham" (Ps. 105:23, 27; 106:22). Such men, who in the Ancient Church were called "Ham" because they lived a life of all cupidities, 
merely prating that they could be saved by faith howsoever they lived, appeared to the ancient people black from the heat of cupidities, and from this were called "Ham." Ham is said to be the "father 
of Canaan" for the reason that such men care nothing how a man lives, provided he frequents sacred rites-for they do still desire some worship. But external worship is the only worship for them; internal 
worship, which belongs solely to charity, they reject. Hence Ham is said to be "the father of Canaan." </p>

<p align="center"><b>Elliott(1983-1999) 1063</b></p><p><b>1063.</b>
'Ham was the father of Canaan' means that from the corrupted Church arose worship in external things devoid of internal, which worship is meant by Canaan. This similarly is clear from what follows, for 
the content of this verse is introductory to what follows. That Ham means the corrupted Church, that is, people who make faith separated from charity the chief thing of religion, is clear in David, 
 </p>
<blockquote>
He smote all the firstborn in Egypt, the beginning of strength in the tents of Ham. <a href="http://bible.gospelcom.net/cgi-bin/bible?passage=Ps%2078:51&amp;version=ESV&amp;interface=print&amp;showfn=yes&amp;showxref">Ps 78:51</a>.

<p>'The firstborn of Egypt' represented faith devoid of charity. That faith is called 'the firstborn 
of Egypt', see what has appeared already in <a href="352.htm">352</a>, <a href="367.htm">367</a>; and that faith is consequently called 'the beginning of strength', as it is here in David, see <a href="http://bible.gospelcom.net/cgi-bin/bible?passage=Gen%2049:3&amp;version=ESV&amp;interface=print&amp;showfn=yes&amp;showxref">Gen 49:3</a>, which refers to Reuben, who, being Jacob's 
firstborn, represented faith and is called 'the beginning of strength'. 'The tents of Ham' is worship arising out of such faith. That 'tents' means worship, see what has appeared already in <a href="414.htm">414</a>. Egypt 
is for this reason called 'the land of Ham' in <a href="http://bible.gospelcom.net/cgi-bin/bible?passage=Ps%20105:23,%2027;%20106:22&amp;version=ESV&amp;interface=print&amp;showfn=yes&amp;showxref">Ps 105:23, 27; 106:22</a>. </p>

<p><b>[2]</b>
 Because such people, who in the Ancient Church were called 'Ham', led lives that consisted of every evil desire, and 
merely babbled on about their being able to be saved by faith no matter how they lived, the ancients saw them as having, from the heat of evil desires, a black appearance; hence they were called Ham<A name="fntext1"></a><A href="#fn1"><sup>a</sup></a>'. 
The reason Ham is called 'the father of Canaan' is that such people do not care at all how a person lives, provided he attends religious services, for they still have the desire for worship of some 
kind. External worship is the only worship for them. Internal worship, which belongs solely to charity, they reject; which is why Ham is called 'the father of Canaan'.

Quod 'Ham is pater Canaanis' significet quod ex Ecclesiam corrupta ortus sit cultus in externis absque internis, qui significatur per 'Canaan,' similiter a sequentibus constat, nam quae in hoc versu 
continentur sunt praemissa sequentium.  Quod Ham significet Ecclesia corruptam, hoc est, eos qui principale religionis faciunt fidem separatam a charitate, constat apud Davidem, 	Percussit omnem primogenitum 
in Aegypto, principium roborum, in tentoriis Hami, Ps. lxxviii 51; </p>
<p>per 'primogenitum Aegypti' repraesentata fuit fides absque charitate; quod fides vocetur 'primogenitus Ecclesiae', videatur 
prius n. 352, 367, et quod fides inde appelletur 'principium roboris,' ut hic apud Davidem, videatur Gen. xlix 3, ubi de Reubene, qui quia primogenitus Jacobi, repraesentabat fidem et appellatur principium 
roboris; 'tentoria Hami' sunt cultus inde; quod 'tentoria' significent cultum, videantur quae prius n. 414. [2] Aegyptus inde vocatur 'terra Hami,' Ps. cv 23, 27; Ps. cvi 22.  Tales qui in Ecclesia 
Antiqua Ham vocati, quia vitam omnium cupiditatum vixerunt, solam garrientes quod salvari possent utcumque viverent, per fidem, antiquis visi sunt nigri ex aestu cupiditatum, unde vocati Ham. {1} 
 Quod Ham 'pater Canaanis' dicatur, inde est quia tales nihil curant quomodo homo vivit, modo frequentet sacra; nam aliquem cultum usque volunt; cultus externis iis unicus est; internum, qui solius 
est charitatis, rejiciunt, inde dicitur Ham 'pater Canaanis.' 	@1 Heb. [ ] (ham)= hot, or dark-coloured.$ </p>
