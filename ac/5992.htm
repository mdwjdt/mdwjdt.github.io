<h3 align="center" class="ired">属天的奥秘 第5992节</h3>
<h4 align="center"></h4><p><strong>5992.</strong>主通过天使引导并保护一个人，他们就在人的头旁边。他们的功能是传授仁与信，并观察这个人的快乐转向哪个方向，尽可能地在不干预此人自由的情况下调整它们，把它们折向良善。天使被禁止以任何暴力的方式行动，从而破碎一个人的恶欲和错误假设；必须温和行动。掌控来自地狱的恶灵也是他们的功能，履行这种功能的方法有无数种，在此仅列举以下几种：当恶灵注入邪恶与虚假时，天使就灌输真理与良善；它们即便不被接受，也有助于缓和前者所注入的东西。地狱灵不断发起攻击，天使则提供保护；这就是秩序。<br />天使尤其调节情感，因为这些情感构成人的生命，以及他的自由。天使还观察是否有以前没有打开的地狱打开，对人有什么影响；当此人将自己带入某种新邪恶时，这种情况就会出现。天使在此人允许的范围内关闭这些地狱，并移除凡试图从那里出来的灵人。他们还驱散造成恶果的奇特的新流注。<br />天使尤其召唤与人同在的良善和真理，使它们反对由恶灵所激活的邪恶和虚假。结果，此人处于中间，没有意识到邪恶或良善；并因处于中间，故可以自由地或转向这一边，或转向那一边。天使利用这些手段靠着主来引导并保护一个人，并且每时每刻都如此行。因为如果天使真有片刻的松懈，中止他们的关心，此人就会陷入恶中，此后永远无法从中被带出来。天使做这些事是出于他们从主所领受的爱，因为没有比从人那里移除邪恶，将他引入天堂更令他们快乐和幸福的了。这是他们的喜乐（参看路加福音<a href="http://39-27.cn/路15.7.htm">15:7</a>）。几乎没有人相信主如此关心一个人，这种关心从人生命的最初直到他生命的最后一刻，此后直到永远持续不断。</p>

The angels, through whom the Lord leads and also protects a man, are near his head. It is their office to inspire charity and faith, and to observe in what direction the man's delights turn, and insofar 
as they can, without interfering with the man's freedom, moderate them and bend them to good. They are forbidden to act with violence and thus break the man's cupidities and principles; but are enjoined 
to act gently. It is also their office to rule the evil spirits who are from hell, which is done in innumerable ways, of which the following only may be mentioned. When the evil spirits pour in 
evils and falsities, the angels insinuate truths and goods, which, if not received, are nevertheless the means of tempering. Infernal spirits continually attack, and the angels protect; such is the order. [2] 
The angels especially regulate the affections, for these make the man's life, and also his freedom. The angels also observe whether any hells are open that were not open before, and from which 
there is influx with the man, which takes place when the man brings himself into any new evil. These hells the angels close so far as the man allows, and remove any spirits who attempt to emerge therefrom. 
They also disperse strange and new influxes that produce evil effects. [3] Especially do the angels call forth the goods and truths that are with a man, and set them in opposition to the evils 
and falsities which the evil spirits excite. Thus the man is in the midst, and does not perceive either the evil or the good; and being in the midst, he is in freedom to turn himself either to the 
one or to the other. By such means do angels from the Lord lead and protect a man, and this every moment, and every moment of a moment; for if the angels were to intermit their care for a single moment, 
the man would be precipitated into evil from which he could never afterward be brought out. These things the angels do from the love they have from the Lord, for they perceive nothing more delightful 
and happy than to remove evils from a man, and lead him to heaven. That this is a joy to them, see Luke 15:7. Scarcely any man believes that the Lord takes such care of a man, and this continually 
from the first thread of his life to the last of it, and afterward to eternity. </p>

The angels through whom the Lord leads and also protects a person are near his head. Their function is to impart charity and faith, to notice the direction in which the person's delights turn, and to 
modify and bend those delights towards what is good, so far as they can do so in the person's freedom. The angels are forbidden to act in any violent manner and thereby crush a person's evil desires 
and false assumptions; they must act gently. Their function is also to control evil spirits who come from hell, which is done in countless ways, of which let only the following be mentioned here: When 
evil spirits infuse evils and falsities the angels instill truths and goods, which - even if they are not accepted - serve to temper what the former infuse. Spirits from hell are constantly on the attack, 
and angels provide protection; and this is a proper state of order. </p>
<p></p>
<p><b>[2]</b>
 In particular the angels moderate affections, since they constitute a person's life and also his freedom. The angels also 
notice any influence on a person from hells which are now open but were not previously so, which happens when a person goes off into some new evil. To the extent that the person allows, the angels 
close those hells; they also remove any spirits who may be trying to come out from there. They also dispel any strange and new influences which can produce evil effects.  </p>
<p></p>
<p><b>[3]</b>
 In particular the angels 
call forth the forms of good and truth residing with a person and set them opposite the evils and falsities activated by the evil spirits. As a result the person is in the middle and is not conscious 
of the evil or of the good; and being in the middle he is in freedom to turn towards one or towards the other. Angels from the Lord employ means like these to lead and protect a person, doing so every 
instant and fraction of an instant. For if the angels were to let up merely for a single moment the person would be plunged into evil from which after that he cannot possibly be brought out. The angels 
are motivated to do all this by a love they receive from the Lord, for nothing gives them greater delight and happiness than to remove evils from a person and lead him to heaven. This is their joy, 
see <a href="http://bible.gospelcom.net/cgi-bin/bible?passage=Luke%2015:7&amp;version=ESV&amp;interface=print&amp;showfn=yes&amp;showxref">Luke 15:7</a>. Scarcely anyone believes the Lord has that kind of concern for a person, a constant concern lasting from the very beginning of a person's existence to the final moment of his life, 
and for evermore after that. </p>

Angeli per quos Dominus ducit et quoque tutatur hominem, sunt prope caput; eorum munus est inspirare charitatem et fidem, et observare jucunda hominis quo se vertunt, et illa, quantum {1}ex libero hominis 
possunt, moderari et flectere ad bonum; illis vetitum est violenter agere et sic frangere hominis cupiditates (c)et principia, sed leniter; munus etiam eorum est regere spiritus malos qui ab inferno, 
quod fit modis innumerabilibus, quorum hos   solum memorare licet; cum mali spiritus infundunt mala et falsa, {2} angeli insinuant (t)vera et bona quae si non recipiuntur, usque per illa temperant; 
(m)infernales {3} spiritus continue aggrediuntur {4}et angeli tutantur, talis est ordo:(n)  [2]angeli imprimis moderantur affectiones, nam hae faciunt {5}vitam hominis, et quoque ejus liberum; tum 
observant angeli si aperiuntur inferna quae non prius aperta fuerunt, a quibus influxus apud hominem, {6}quod fit cum homo in novum malum se infert; illa inferna angeli, quantum homo patitur, claudunt; 
etiam angeli removent spiritus si quinam inde tentant emergere; [3] dissipant etiam influxus peregrinos et novos a quibus effectus mali; imprimis evocant angeli bona et vera quae apud hominem, {7}et 
opponunt contra mala et falsa quae mali spiritus excitant; inde homo in medio est, nec appercipit malum nec bonum, et quia in medio, est in libero se convertendi ad unum aut ad alterum; per talia angeli 
a Domino ducunt et tutantur hominem, et hoc unoquovis momento, et momenti momento; nam si modo angeli uno momento intermitterent, homo praecipitaretur in malum a quo postea {8}nusquam potest educi. 
 Haec faciunt angeli ex amore qui illis (c)a Domino, nam nihil jucundius et felicius percipiunt quam removere mala ab homine et illum ducere ad caelum; quod hoc gaudium illis, videatur Luc. xv 7. 
 Quod Dominus talem curam pro homine habeat, et hoc continue, a primo ejus vitae stamine ad ultimum, et dein in aeternum, vix aliquis homo credit. @1 A d ex, i in$ @2 i tunc$ @3 i enim$ @4 at$ @5
