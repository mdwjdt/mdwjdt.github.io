<h3 align="center" class="ired">属天的奥秘 第3138节</h3>
<h4 align="center"></h4><p><strong>3138.</strong>这三节论述了属世人的预备和启示，以便要与良善在理性中联结的真理能从属世人中被召唤出来。至于这预备和启示，情况如下：有两种光形成人智性概念，即天堂之光和尘世之光。天堂之光来自主，在来世，对天使来说，主就是太阳和月亮（参看<a href="1053.htm">1053</a>，<a href="1521.htm">1521</a>，<a href="1529.htm">1529</a>，<a href="1530.htm">1530</a>节）；而尘世之光来自肉眼所看到的太阳和月亮。内在人通过天堂之光拥有自己的视觉和理解力，而外在人则通过尘世之光拥有自己的视觉和理解力。天堂之光进入于尘世之光所形成的概念的流注产生启示，同时产生认可。若对应存在，这认可就是对真理的认可；若对应不存在，这认可就是对虚假而非真理的认可。启示和认可是不可能的，除非情感或爱存在。情感或爱是属灵之热，赋予光所启示之物以生命。这好比阳光，赋予植物生命的，并非阳光，而是这光所含的热。这一事实从一年当中的四个季节明显看出来。<br />接下来的这几节则描述了进一步的预备，也就是说，天堂之光，就是主的神性之光，流入主的属世人里面于尘世之光所形成的概念里，以便祂能以寻常的方式将那要与良善在理性中联结的真理从其属世人中带出来。因此，主为了使祂的人性变成神性，便以寻常的方式来到世间。也就是说，祂愿意像其他人那样出生，像其他人那样接受教导，像其他人那样再生。不同之处在于：人通过主再生，而主不仅重生自己，还荣耀自己，就是使祂自己变成神性；而且，人通过仁与信的流注被新造，而主通过在祂里面、属于祂的神性之爱的流注被新造。由此可见，人的重生就是主荣耀的一个形像；或也可说，人能在作为一个形像的人重生的过程中一窥主荣耀的过程，尽管是远远地。</p>

These three verses treat of the preparation and enlightenment of the natural man in order that the truth might be called forth thence which was to be conjoined with good in the rational. But with preparation 
and enlightenment the case is as follows: There are two lights which form the intellectual things of man-the light of heaven, and the light of the world; the light of heaven is from the Lord, 
who to angels in the other life is a Sun and Moon (see n. 1053, 1521, 1529, 1530); the light of the world is from the sun and moon which appear before the bodily sight. The internal man has its sight 
and its understanding from the light of heaven; but the external man has its sight and its understanding from the light of the world. The influx of the light of heaven into the things which are of the 
world's light, effects enlightenment and at the same time observance; an observance of truth if there is correspondence, and an observance of falsity instead of truth if there is not correspondence. 
But enlightenment and observance are impossible unless there is affection or love, which is spiritual heat, and which gives life to the things that are enlightened by the light; comparatively as the 
sun's light does not give life to the things of the vegetable kingdom, but the heat that is in the light, as is evident from the seasons of the year.  [2] In the verses which next follow, the preparation 
is further described-namely, that the light of heaven which is the Lord's Divine light inflowed into the things that were of the light of the world in His natural man, in order that He might bring 
out thence the truth which was to be conjoined with good in the rational; thus by the ordinary way. And therefore in order that the Lord might make the human Divine by the ordinary way, He came into 
the world; that is, it was His will to be born as a man, and to be instructed as a man, and to be reborn as a man; but with the difference that man is reborn of the Lord, whereas the Lord not only regenerated 
Himself, but also glorified Himself, that is, made Himself Divine; and further, that a man is made new by an influx of charity and faith, but the Lord, by the Divine love which was in Him and 
which was His. Hence it may be seen that the regeneration of man is an image of the glorification of the Lord; or what is the same, that in the process of the regeneration of man may be seen as in an 
image, although remotely, the process of the Lord's glorification. </p>

These three verses deal with the preparation and enlightenment of the natural man so that the truth which was to be joined to good in the Rational might be summoned from there. With regard to that preparation 
and enlightenment the position is that there are two kinds of light which shape man's intellectual concepts - the light of heaven, and the light of the world. The light of heaven comes from 
the Lord who to angels in the next life is the Sun and Moon, see <a href="1053.htm">1053</a>, <a href="1521.htm">1521</a>, <a href="1529.htm">1529</a>, <a href="1530.htm">1530</a>. The light of the world comes from the sun and moon which a person sees with his physical eyes. The internal man 
receives his sight and understanding from the light of heaven whereas the external man receives his sight and understanding from the light of the world. The influx of the light of heaven into ideas formed 
in the light of the world produces enlightenment and at the same time recognition - the recognition of truth if a correspondence exists, the recognition of falsity instead of truth if that correspondence 
does not exist. But enlightenment and recognition are not possible unless affection or love is present, which is spiritual warmth and imparts life to the things illumined by the light. This 
may be compared to the light of the sun. It is not the light of the sun but the warmth within the light that imparts life to plants, as is evident from the seasons of the year. </p>

<p><b>[2]</b>
 The verses which 
follow immediately after this describe the preparation further - the light of heaven, which is the Lord's Divine light, flowed into the ideas formed in the light of the world in His natural man so that 
He might bring forth from there the truth that was to be joined to good in the Rational. Thus it was to be brought forth in what is the ordinary way. Therefore to make His Human Divine the Lord came 
into the world in the ordinary way, that is, He was willing to be born as any other person is born, to receive instruction as any other does, and to be born again as any other, but with this difference: 
Man is born again from the Lord, whereas the Lord not only regenerated Himself from Himself, but also glorified Himself, that is, made Himself Divine; also man is made new through the influx of charity 
and faith, whereas the Lord was made so through the influx of Divine Love that was within Him and that was His own. From this it may be seen that man's regeneration is an image of the Lord's glorification, 
or what amounts to the same, that in the process of man's regeneration as the image one can envisage, though remotely, the process of the Lord's glorification. </p>

In tribus his versibus agitur de praeparatione et illustratione naturalis hominis, ut inde verum, quod conjungendum bono in rationali, evocaretur: sed cum praeparatione et illustratione ita se habet: 
sunt binae luces, quae formant intellectualia hominis, lux caeli, et lux mundi; lux caeli est a Domino, Qui in altera vita angelus est Sol et Luna, videatur n. 1053, 1521, 1529, 1530; lux mundi est 
ex sole et luna, quae coram visu corporeo apparent; internus homo suum visum et suum intellectum habet a luce caeli, externus autem homo suum visum et suum intellectum habet a luce mundi; influxus lucis 
caeli in illa quae sunt lucis mundi, facit illustrationem et simul apperceptionem; si correspondentia sit, apperceptionem veri, si non correspondentia, apperceptionem falsi pro vero; sed illustratio 
et apperceptio non dari potest nisi (t)sit affectio seu amor, qui est calor spiritualis, et dat vitam illis quae per lucem illustrantur; sicut comparative lux solis non dat vitam vegetabilibus, sed 
calor qui in luce, ut patet ex temporibus anni. [2] In versibus qui nunc proxime sequuntur, describitur praeparatio ulterius, quod nempe lux caeli quae est Divina Domini, (x)influeret in illa quae erant 
lucis mundi in naturali Ipsius homine, {1}ut inde verum quod conjungendum bono in Rationali, educeret, ita {2}per viam ordinariam; idcirco, ut Dominus Humanum faceret Divinum, per viam ordinariam in 
mundum venit, hoc est, voluit {3}sicut alius homo nasci, et sicut alius instrui, et sicut alius renasci, sed cum differentia quod homo renascatur a Domino, sed quod Dominus Semet Ipsum non modo regeneravit, 
sed etiam glorificavit, hoc est, Divinum fecit; tum quod homo per influxum charitatis et fidei novus fiat, at Dominus per amorem Divinum qui in Ipso, et qui Ipsius: inde videri potest quod regeneratio 
hominis sit imago glorificationis Domini, seu quod idem, quod in processu regenerationis hominis sicut in imagine, videri queat, tametsi remote, processus glorificationis Domini. @1 vel$  @2
