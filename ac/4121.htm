<h3 align="center" class="ired">属天的奥秘 第4121节</h3>
<h4 align="center"></h4><p><strong>4121.</strong>“拉班带领他身边的众弟兄”表取代它所失去的那些良善的诸良善。这从“弟兄”的含义清楚可知，“弟兄”是指诸良善（参看<a href="2360.htm">2360</a>，<a href="3160.htm">3160</a>，<a href="3303.htm">3303</a>，<a href="3459.htm">3459</a>，<a href="3803.htm">3803</a>，<a href="3815.htm">3815</a>节）。就内义而言，“弟兄”表示那些处于同一种良善与真理，也就是处于同一种对良善与真理的情感之人。事实上，在来世，所有人都照其情感而聚集在不同社群中；那些聚集在某个社群的人就构成兄弟关系。不是因为他们自称兄弟，而是因为他们因着彼此的结合而成为兄弟。在来世，正是良善与真理产生了世上那被称为血亲和姻亲关系的；因此，这两样事物之间存在对应关系，也就是说，后者对应于那良善与真理。事实上，就其本身而言，良善与真理只承认主，并不承认其他父，因为它们唯独来自主。因此，所有处于良善与真理的人彼此间都具有兄弟般的情谊。然而亲密程度取决于各自良善与真理的具体性质。在圣言中，这些程度就由“弟兄”、“姐妹”、“女婿”、“儿媳”、“孙子”、“孙女”，以及家族中许多其它亲戚关系的名称来表示。<br />在世上，这些名称被赋予出身于同一父母的人，无论他们彼此在情感上如何不同。但这种兄弟或亲密关系在来世会被解除，除非他们在世时就处于同样的良善，或同样的情感，否则，他们就进入其它兄弟关系。诚然，一开始，他们通常聚在一起，但很快就会分道扬镳。因为在来世，将人们聚在一起的不是财富或金钱，而是情感，如刚才所述，到那时，情感的性质如同在晴天白日那样清楚，对彼此的情感也是如此。由于情感在那里显而易见，并且各人的情感将各人吸引到他的社群，所以那些性情不同的人就断了联系。在这种情况下，双方都会解除外在人所具有的一切兄弟和朋友关系，而内在个所具有的，则保留下来。“拉班带领他身边的众弟兄”之所以表示取代它所失去的那些良善的诸良善，是因为如前所述，当一个社群与另一个社群分离时，如前所述（<a href="4077.htm">4077</a>，<a href="4110.htm">4110</a>，<a href="4111.htm">4111</a>节），它便转向不同的社群，因而转向取代前者的其它良善。</p>

And he took his brethren with him. That this signifies goods in place of those which it had lost, is evident from the signification of "brethren," as being goods (see n. 2360, 3160, 3303, 3459, 3803, 
3815). By "brethren" in the internal sense are signified those who are in similar good and truth, that is, in a similar affection of good and truth. For in the other life all are consociated in accordance 
with the affections, and those who are consociated constitute a brotherhood. Not that they call themselves brethren, but that they are brethren by conjunction. In the other life it is good and truth 
that produce that which on earth is called relationship by blood and by marriage; and therefore there is a correspondence between the two things; for regarded in themselves goods and truths acknowledge 
no other father than the Lord, for they are from Him alone. Hence all who are in goods and truths are in brotherhood; but still there are degrees of relationship according to the quality of the 
goods and truths. These degrees are signified in the Word by "brothers," "sisters," "sons-in-law," "daughters-in-law," "grandsons," "granddaughters," and by other family names.  [2] On earth they are 
so named with reference to a common parentage, however they may differ in regard to affections; but this brotherhood or relationship is dissipated in the other life, and unless they have been in similar 
good on earth, they there come into other brotherhoods. At first indeed they for the most part come together, but in a short time are separated; for in that world it is not wealth that keeps men 
together, but as just said, affections, the quality of which is then manifest as in clear day, and also the kind of affection which one has had toward another.  And as these are manifest, and as everyone's 
affection draws him to his society, those who have been of a discordant disposition are dissociated; and all the brotherhood and friendship which had been of the external man are obliterated on 
both sides, and that which is of the internal man remains. That by "he took his brethren with him" are signified goods in place of those which it had lost, is because as before said when one society 
is separated from another, it comes to a different society, and therefore to other goods in place of the former (n. 4077, 4110, 4111). </p>

<p align="center"><b>Elliott(1983-1999) 4121</b></p><p><b>4121.</b>
'And he took his brothers with him' means forms of good replacing those which it had lost. This is clear from the meaning of 'brothers' as forms of good, dealt with in <a href="2360.htm">2360</a>, <a href="3160.htm">3160</a>, <a href="3303.htm">3303</a>, <a href="3459.htm">3459</a>, <a href="3803.htm">3803</a>, <a href="3815.htm">3815</a>. 
In the internal sense 'brothers' means people who are governed by the same kind of goodness and truth, that is, they share the same affection for these. Indeed all in the next life are grouped together 
in different communities on the basis of their affections; and those so grouped together in any community constitute a brotherhood. They do so not because they call themselves brothers but because 
they are such through their being joined to one another. In the next life it is goodness and truth that lie behind that which on earth is called a blood-relationship and a relationship by marriage, 
and for this reason the latter correspond to that goodness and truth. Indeed regarded in themselves forms of goodness and truth acknowledge no other father than the Lord, for they exist from Him alone, 
and therefore all who are governed by forms of goodness and truth exist in a brotherly relationship with one another. Yet degrees of affinity exist, determined by the particular nature of each form 
of goodness or truth. In the Word these degrees are meant by brothers, sisters, sons-in-law, daughters- in-law, grandsons, granddaughters, and many other names for relatives in a family. </p>
<p></p>
<p><b>[2]</b>
 On earth 
however these names are given to people because they have the same parents, no matter how much these people differ from one another in affection. But that kind of brotherly relationship and affinity 
is dissolved in the next life, and unless on earth they have been governed by the same affection they all enter different brotherly relationships. Such people, it is true, do as a general rule come 
together initially, but in a short while they are parted. For in the next life it is not money that holds people together but, as has been stated, affections, the nature of which are plain to see as 
if in clear daylight, as also is the nature of the affection which one person has had for another. Since affections are so plain to see there, and since everyone's affection attracts him towards the 
community that is his, the association with one another of people whose mental dispositions have not been in agreement is therefore broken. In that case all ties of brotherly relationship and of friendship 
possessed by the external man are eliminated in both parties, while those which had existed with the internal man remain. The reason why 'he took his brothers with him' means forms of good replacing 
those which it had lost is that when one community is being separated from another, as stated above in <a href="4077.htm">4077</a>, <a href="4110.htm">4110</a>, <a href="4111.htm">4111</a>, it moves towards another and so towards other forms of good which replace 
the former. </p>

Et accepit fratres suos secum': quod significet bona loco illorum quae amisit, constat a significatione `fratrum' quod sint bona, de qua n. 2360, 3160, 3303, 3459, 3803, 3815; per `fratres' in sensu 
interno significantur illi qui in simili bono et vero sunt, hoc est, in simili affectione boni et veri; consociantur erum omnes in altera vita secundum affectiones, et qui consociati sunt, fraternitatem 
constituunt, non quod dicant se fratres, sed quod sint fratres per conjunctionem; ipsum bonum et verum in altera vita faciunt id quod in terris vocatur consanguineum et affine, quapropter 
correspondent: bona enim et vera in se spectata non agnoscunt {1} alium patrem quam Dominum, nam ab Ipso solo illa, inde in fraternitate sunt omnes qui in bonis et veris; sed usque sunt gradus {2} 
secundum qualitatem bonorum et verorum; gradus illi (t)in Verbo significantur per `fratres, sorores, generos, nurus, nepotes, neptes,' et per plura familiarum nomina: [2] in terris autem ita nominantur 
respective ad communes parentes, utcumque quoad affectiones discrepant, sed fraternitas illa et affinitas in altera vita dissipatur, et quisque ibi, nisi in terris in simili bono fuerint, in 
alias fraternitates venit; principio quidem ut plurimum conveniunt, sed brevi disjunguntur, nam lucra ibi non consociant sed, ut dictum, affectiones, quae tunc patent sicut in clara die quale' sunt, 
etiam quali affectione unus fuerat erga alium; et quia patent et affectio unumquemvis ad suam societatem trahit, ideo dissociantur qui discordi animo fuerunt; et `tunc quoque `utrinque' obliteratur 
omnis {4} fraternitas et omnis amicitia quae fuerat externi hominis, e manet illa quae est interni. Quod per `accepit fratres suos secum' significentur bona loco illorum quae amisit, inde est quia 
cum separatur societas una ab altera, sicut {5} supra n. 4077, 4110, 4111 dictum, tunc venit ad aliam, proinde ad alia bona loco illorum.      @1 bonum enim et verum in se spectatum non agnoscit$
