<h3 align="center" class="ired">属天的奥秘 第295节</h3>
<h4 align="center"></h4><p><strong>295.</strong>本节说耶和华神“用皮子作衣服给他们穿”，这是因为，上古之人以其天真无邪而被说成是“赤身露体”的。当天真之性失丧以后，他们意识到自己落入恶中，也被称为“赤身露体”。<br />为让故事呈现连贯的历史性，以符合上古之人的言说习惯，经上说他们被穿上衣服，“免得赤身露体”，亦即陷入恶中。对于他们具有属灵和属世之善，这从本章1-13节的解释和本节“耶和华用皮子作衣服给他们穿”的描述可知。因为本节论述的是上古教会的第一代，尤其是具有该善的第二代和第三代。</p>

<p><strong>[NCE]295.</strong> The reason it says they were dressed in a leather tunic is this: The earliest people were described as naked on account of their innocence. Later, when innocence died, they observed that they were caught up in evil, and that too is described as nudity. But now, in order for all the details to come together as a story, as required by the ancients' manner of speech, they are said to be clothed, so as not to be naked, or involved in evil.{*1} They did possess spiritual and earthly goodness, as is clear from statements and evidence regarding them offered at verses <a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_295/bible_king-james-version_genesis_3_1-13" target=_top>1-13</a> of the present chapter [<a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_295/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_193" target=_top>193</a>, <a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_295/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_216" target=_top>216-217</a>, <a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_295/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_224" target=_top>224-225</a>] and from the assertion here that Jehovah God made clothes for them. This verse, you see, concerns not only the first generation in the church but more particularly the second and third generations, who were granted that kind of good.<br /><br /><strong>Footnotes:</strong><br />{*1} In regard to the ancients' manner of speech, see <a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_295/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_66" target=_top>66</a>.

The reason why they are said to be "clothed with a coat of skin" is that the most ancient people were said to be "naked" on account of their innocence; but when they lost their innocence they became 
conscious that they were in evil, which also is called "nakedness." That all things might appear to cohere historically (in accordance with the way of speaking of the most ancient people), they are here 
said to be "clothed lest they should be naked" or in evil. Their being in spiritual and natural good is evident from what was remarked above concerning them, from verse 1 to 13 of this chapter, as 
well as from its being here related that "Jehovah God made them a coat of skin, and clothed them;" for it here treats of the first-and more especially of the second and third-posterities of the church, 
who were endowed with such good. </p>

<p align="center"><b>Elliott(1983-1999) 295</b></p><p><b>295.</b>
The reason they are said to have been 'clothed with a coat of skin' is that [initially] the most ancient people, on account of their innocence, were called 'naked', but that later on, once their innocence 
had perished, they realized they were dwelling in evil, which is called 'nakedness' as well. So that everything may appear to fit together as history according to the way the most ancient people 
expressed themselves, they are here said to have been 'clothed' to avoid their being naked, that is, dwelling in evil. That they possessed spiritual and natural good is clear from what has been said 
and shown about them in verses 1-13 of this chapter, and at this point from the statement that Jehovah God made [coats of skin] and clothed them. For the subject here is the first generation, but more 
especially the second and third generations, of the descendants of the Church, who were endowed with such good.  </p>

</p><b>295.</b>
Quod 'tunica pellis vestiti' dicantur, causa est quia antiquissimi propter innocentiam dicti 'nudi,' et dein cum innocentia periit, quod animadverterint se esse in malo, quod etiam vocatur 'nuditas'; 
ut historice omnia cohaerere appareant secundum modum loquendi antiquissimis, hic dicuntur 'vestiti,' ne nudi seu in malo: quod in bono spirituali et naturali fuerint, constat ex iis quae de illis dicta 
et ostensa sunt a versu 1 ad 13 hujus capitis; et nunc ex eo quod Jehovah Deus fecerit, et vestiverit eos: agitur enim hic de prima, sed imprimis de secunda et tertia posteritate Ecclesiae, qui donati 
sunt tali bono. </p>
