<h3 align="center" class="ired">属天的奥秘 第7553节</h3>
<h4 align="center"></h4><p><strong>7553.</strong>“看哪，到明天约在这时候，我必叫极重的冰雹雨降下”表毁坏他们当中的教会一切事物的虚假。这从“冰雹雨”的含义清楚可知，“冰雹雨”是指由邪恶所生的、毁坏信之真理和良善，因而毁坏教会事物的虚假。“冰雹雨”之所以表示这些虚假，是因为冰雹就像石头，毁坏人和牲畜，以及田间的庄稼，还因为它们是冰块。“雨”一般表示一种祝福，在反面意义上表示一种诅咒（参看<a href="2445.htm">2445</a>节）。当表示一种祝福时，它表示信之真理和仁之良善的流注和接受，因为这是一种祝福。但当表示一种诅咒时，它表示与信之真理对立的虚假，以及与仁之良善对立的邪恶，因为这些是一种诅咒。然而，“冰雹雨”一般表示由邪恶所生的虚假，尤其由邪恶所生、反对教会真理和良善的虚假所带来的一种诅咒。<br />在以下经文中，“冰雹雨”就表示这类虚假：<br />我必用瘟疫和血与哥革争辩；我也必将暴雨、冰雹与火并硫磺降与他和他的部队，并跟随他的众民。（以西结书<a href="http://39-27.cn/结38.22.htm">38:22</a>）<br />“歌革”表示脱离内在的外在敬拜，因而表示那些当仁爱被灭绝时，使得神性敬拜完全在于外在仪式的人；“冰雹”表示由邪恶所生的虚假。<br />同一先知书：<br />我的手必攻击那见虚假异象，用谎诈占卜的先知。你要对那些抹上未泡透灰的人说：墙要倒塌，必有暴雨漫过。大冰雹啊，你们要降下，狂风也要吹裂这墙。（以西结书<a href="http://39-27.cn/结13.9.htm">13:9</a>，<a href="http://39-27.cn/结13.11.htm">11</a>）<br />“见虚假异象，用谎诈占卜的先知”表示那些教导邪恶和虚假的人；“那些抹上未泡透灰的人”表示他们捏造虚假，使它们看似真理的人。这些人因其虚假而被称为“冰雹”；但原文，在此处和前面引用的经文中，“冰雹”是用另一个表示“大冰雹”的词来表达的。<br />以赛亚书：<br />耶和华必使人听祂荣耀的声音，又使祂的膀臂看见平静，在忿怒的忿恨并吞灭的火焰与霹雷、洪水、冰雹中。（以赛亚书<a href="http://39-27.cn/赛30.30.htm">30:30</a>-<a href="http://39-27.cn/赛30.31.htm">31</a>）<br />“冰雹”表示真理通过虚假而荒凉。同一先知书：<br />看哪，主有一大能大力者，像一场冰雹的洪水，像毁灭的暴风，像涨溢的大洪水，祂必用手将它们摔落于地。冰雹必冲去谎言的避所；大水必漫过藏身之处。（以赛亚书<a href="http://39-27.cn/赛28.2.htm">28:2</a>，<a href="http://39-27.cn/赛28.17.htm">17</a>）<br />“洪水”表示陷入虚假，因而表示真理的荒凉（<a href="705.htm">705</a>，<a href="739.htm">739</a>，<a href="790.htm">790</a>，<a href="5725.htm">5725</a>，<a href="6853.htm">6853</a>节）；“一场冰雹的洪水”表示真理通过虚假而毁坏。诗篇：<br />祂降冰雹打坏他们的葡萄树，下重重的冰雹打坏他们的桑树。又把他们的牲畜交给冰雹，把他们的群畜交给火炭。祂打发猛烈的怒气临到他们。（诗篇<a href="http://39-27.cn/诗78.47.htm">78:47</a>-<a href="http://39-27.cn/诗78.49.htm">49</a>）<br /><br />祂给他们降下冰雹为雨，在他们的地上降下火焰，也击打他们的葡萄树和无花果树，打碎他们境内的树木。（诗篇<a href="http://39-27.cn/诗105.32.htm">105:32</a>-<a href="http://39-27.cn/诗105.33.htm">33</a>）<br />“冰雹和雨”表示真理和良善通过邪恶所生的虚假而荒凉；“葡萄树”表示内在教会的真理和良善；“桑树和无花果树”表示外在教会的真理和良善。<br />祂降雪如羊毛，撒霜如尘土，祂掷下冰雹如碎渣，在祂的寒冷面前，谁能站立得住呢？（诗篇<a href="http://39-27.cn/诗147.16.htm">147:16</a>-<a href="http://39-27.cn/诗147.17.htm">17</a>）<br />“冰雹”表示由邪恶所生的虚假。<br />祂以黑暗为祂的藏身之处，以水的黑暗、天空的厚云为祂四围的帐幕。因祂面前的光辉，祂的厚云行过，便有冰雹火炭。耶和华也在天上打雷，至高者发出声音，便有冰雹火炭。祂射出箭来，使它们四散。（诗篇<a href="http://39-27.cn/诗18.11.htm">18:11</a>-<a href="http://39-27.cn/诗18.15.htm">15</a>）<br />“冰雹”表示由邪恶所生、使真理和良善荒凉的虚假。<br />启示录：<br />第一位天使吹号，就有雹子与火搀着血丢在地上。树的三分之一被烧掉了，一切的青草也被烧掉了。（启示录<a href="http://39-27.cn/启8.7.htm">8:7</a>）<br />“雹子”表示由邪恶所生的虚假；“搀着血的火”表示恶欲连同被歪曲的真理；“被烧掉的树”表示被恶欲的邪恶毁坏的真理的知识或对真理的认知；“被烧掉的青草”表示以同样的方式被毁坏的真理的记忆知识。“火”表示恶欲（参看<a href="1297.htm">1297</a>，<a href="1861.htm">1861</a>，<a href="2446.htm">2446</a>，<a href="5071.htm">5071</a>，<a href="5215.htm">5215</a>，<a href="6314.htm">6314</a>，<a href="6832.htm">6832</a>，<a href="7324.htm">7324</a>节）；“血”表示被歪曲的真理（<a href="4735.htm">4735</a>，<a href="6978.htm">6978</a>，<a href="7317.htm">7317</a>，<a href="7326.htm">7326</a>节）；“树”表示知识或认知（<a href="2722.htm">2722</a>e，<a href="2972.htm">2972</a>节）。<br />约书亚记：<br />他们在以色列人面前逃跑，正在伯和仑下坡的时候，耶和华从天上降大石头在他们身上，直降到亚西加，使他们死亡；被冰雹打死的，比以色列人用剑杀死的还多。（约书亚记<a href="http://39-27.cn/书10.11.htm">10:11</a>）<br />这论及与基遍争战的五王；这些王和他们的百姓代表那些陷入由邪恶所生的虚假之人，所以他们因冰雹而死亡；少量冰雹被称为“石头”，因为“石头”也表示虚假。由此可见“冰雹”和“冰雹雨”表示什么，即表示由邪恶所生的虚假；因而也表示真理和良善的荒凉，因为使它们荒凉的，是由邪恶所生的虚假。</p>

<p align="center"><b>Potts(1905-1910) 7553</b></p><p><b>7553.</b>
Behold, tomorrow about this time I will cause it to rain a very grievous hail. That this signifies falsities destroying all things of the church with them, is evident from the signification of a "rain 
of hail," as being falsities from evil destroying the truths and goods of faith, thus the things of the church. That a "rain of hail" has this signification is because it is like stones, and destroys 
both men and beasts, also the produce of the field, and likewise because it is cold. A "rain" in general signifies a blessing, and in the opposite sense a curse (see n. 2445); when a blessing, it signifies 
the influx and reception of the truth that is of faith and of the good that is of charity, for this is a blessing; but when it signifies a curse, it signifies falsity that is contrary to the truth 
of faith, and evil that is contrary to the good of charity, for these are a curse. But a "rain of hail" in general signifies the curse that belongs to falsity from evil, and indeed to falsity from 
evil against the truths and goods of the church. [2] This is signified by a "rain of hail" in the following passages: </p>
<p>     I will dispute with God with pestilence and with blood; and I will make it 
rain upon him, and upon his bands, and upon the many peoples that are with him, an inundating rain, and hailstones, fire, and sulphur (Ezek. 38:22); </p>
<p>"Gog" denotes outward worship separate from inward, 
thus those who when charity is extinct make everything of Divine worship consist in outward things; "hailstones" denote falsities from evil. [3] In the same: </p>
<p>     My hand shall be against the prophets 
that see vanity, and that divine a lie; say unto them that daub with what is untempered, that it shall fall; there shall be an inundating rain, by which ye hailstones shall fall; and a wind of 
storms shall burst through it (Ezek. 13:9, 11); </p>
<p>"the prophets that see vanity and divine a lie" denote those who teach evils and falsities; "those who daub with what is untempered" denotes that they 
invent falsities, and make them appear like truths. These are called "hailstones" from falsities; but "hail" in this and in the passage above quoted is expressed in the original by another word which 
means "great hail." [4] In Isaiah: </p>
<p>     Then Jehovah shall cause the glory of His voice to be heard, and His arm shall see quiet, in the indignation of anger, and a flame of devouring fire, with scattering 
and inundation, and with hailstone (Isa. 30:30-31); </p>
<p>where "hailstone" denotes the vastation of truth through falsities. In the same: </p>
<p>     Behold the Lord is strong and mighty; like an inundation 
of hail, a storm of slaughter, like an inundation of mighty waters overflowing, shall He cast down to the earth with the hand; the hail shall overthrow the refuge of a lie, and they shall inundate 
the hiding place of waters (Isa. 28:2, 17); </p>
<p>"an inundation" denotes immersion in falsities, and thus the vastation of truth (n. 705, 739, 790, 5725, 6853); "an inundation of hail" denotes the destruction 
of truth through falsities. [5] In David: </p>
<p>     He smote their vine with hail, and their sycamores with grievous hail; and He shut up their beast with the hail, and their cattle with coals of 
fire. He sent against them the wrath of His anger (Ps. 78:47-49).      He made their rains hail, a flaming fire in their land, and smote their vine and their fig-tree, and broke in pieces the tree of 
their border (Ps. 105:32-33); </p>
<p>"hail and rain" denote the vastation of truth and good through falsities from evil; the "vine" denotes the truth and good of the internal church; the "sycamore" and the 
"fig-tree," denote the truths and goods of the external church. In the same: </p>
<p>     Who giveth snow like wool; He scattereth the hoar frost like dust, who castest forth His hail like morsels; who can 
stand before His cold? (Ps. 147:16-17); </p>
<p>"hail" denotes falsities from evils. In the same: </p>
<p>     He made darkness His hiding place, His circuits His tent, the darkness of the waters, the clouds of the 
heavens, from the brightness before Him the clouds passed, with hailstone and coals of fire; Jehovah thundered in the heavens, and the Most High gave His voice, hailstone and coals of fire, so that He 
sent arrows and scattered them (Ps. 18:12-15); </p>
<p>"hailstone" denotes falsities from evil which vastate truths and goods. [6] In John: </p>
<p>     The first angel sounded, and there came hail and fire mingled 
with blood, and it fell upon the earth, so that the third part of the trees was burnt up, and all the green grass was burnt up (Rev. 8:7); </p>
<p>"hail" denotes falsities from evil; "fire mingled with blood," 
the evil of cupidities together with falsified truths; the "trees that were burnt up" denote the knowledges of truth destroyed by the evil of cupidities; the "green grass that was burnt up" denotes 
the memory-knowledges of truth likewise destroyed. (That "fire" denotes the evil of cupidities, see n. 1297, 1861, 2446, 5071, 5215, 6314, 6832, 7324; that "blood" denotes falsified truth, n. 4735, 
6978, 7317, 7326; that "trees" denote knowledges, n. 2722, 2972.) [7] In Joshua: </p>
<p>     It came to pass, as they fled before Israel in the going down of Bethhoron, when Jehovah cast down upon them 
great stones from the heavens even unto Azekah, that they died; there were more who died with the hailstones than they whom the sons of Israel slew with the sword (Josh. 10:11); </p>
<p>this is said of the five 
kings who fought against Gibeon; by these kings and their people were represented those who are in falsities from evils, therefore they died with the hailstones; morsels of hail are called "stones," 
because "stones" also signify falsities. From all this it is evident what is signified by "hail" and "rain of hail," namely, falsities from evils; and consequently the vastation of truth and good is 
also signified, for this is effected through falsities from evils. </p>

<p align="center"><b>Elliott(1983-1999) 7553</b></p><p><b>7553.</b>
'Behold, about this time tomorrow I am causing it to rain an extremely heavy hail' means falsities destroying all things of the Church among them. This is clear from the meaning of 'rain in the form 
of hail' as falsities arising from evil that destroy forms of the truth and good of faith, thus things of the Church. Those falsities are meant by 'rain in the form of hail' because then the raindrops 
are like stones and can destroy both men and beasts, as well as crops in the field, and also because they are pieces of ice. In general 'rain' means a blessing, or in the contrary sense a curse, <a href="1445.htm">1445</a>. 
When it means a blessing a flowing in and receiving of the truth of faith and the good of charity is meant; for that is a blessing. But when 'rain' means a curse falsity opposed to the truth of faith 
and evil opposed to the good of charity is meant, for these are a curse. 'Rain in the form of hail' however in general means a curse which is brought on by falsity arising from evil, in particular of 
falsity arising from evil that is opposed to the Church's truths and forms of good. </p>
<p></p>
<p><b>[2]</b>
 These kinds of falsity are meant by 'rain in the form of hail' in the following places: In Ezekiel, </p>
<blockquote>
I will 
dispute with Gog with pestilence and blood; and deluging rain and hailstones, fire and brimstone will I cause to rain on him and on his hordes, and on the many peoples that are with him. <a href="http://bible.gospelcom.net/cgi-bin/bible?passage=Ezek%2038:22&amp;version=ESV&amp;interface=print&amp;showfn=yes&amp;showxref">Ezek 38:22</a>. 
</blockquote>
<p>'Gog' 
stands for external worship separated from internal, thus for those who, when charity has been annihilated, make Divine worship consist entirely in external observances. 'Hailstones' stands 
for falsities that arise from evil.  </p>
<p></p>
<p><b>[3]</b>
 In the same prophet, </p>
<blockquote>
Let My hand be against the prophets who see vanity and divine a lie. Say to those who daub [the wall] with what is not suitable that 
it will fall. There will come deluging rain from which you, O hailstones, will fall; and stormy wind will tear it apart. <a href="http://bible.gospelcom.net/cgi-bin/bible?passage=Ezek%2013:9,%2011&amp;version=ESV&amp;interface=print&amp;showfn=yes&amp;showxref">Ezek 13:9, 11</a>. 
</blockquote>
<p>'Prophets who are seers of vanity and diviners of a lie' 
stands for those who are teachers of evils and falsities. 'Those who daub [the wall] with what is unsuitable' stands for the fact that they fabricate falsities and make them look like the truth. These 
people are called 'hailstones' because of their falsities. But in the original language a different word, meaning intense hail, is used here and in the preceding quotation.  </p>
<p></p>
<p><b>[4]</b>
 In Isaiah, </p>
<blockquote>
Then 
Jehovah will cause His glorious voice<A name="fntext1"></a><A href="#fn1"><sup>a</sup></a> to be heard, and His arm will see repose, in the indignation of [His] anger, and the flame of a devouring fire, [in] scattering and deluging, and hailstones. <a href="http://bible.gospelcom.net/cgi-bin/bible?passage=Isa%2030:30,%2031&amp;version=ESV&amp;interface=print&amp;showfn=yes&amp;showxref">Isa 30:30, 31</a>. 
</blockquote>
<p>'Hailstones' stands for the laying waste of truth by means of falsities. In the same prophet, </p>
<blockquote>
Behold, powerful and strong is the Lord, like a deluge of hail, a killing tempest, like 
a deluge of mighty overflowing waters, He will cast them down to the earth with His hand. The hail will overturn the refuge of a lie, and the waters will deluge the hiding-place.<A name="fntext2"></a><A href="#fn2"><sup>b</sup></a> <a href="http://bible.gospelcom.net/cgi-bin/bible?passage=Isa%2028:2,%2017&amp;version=ESV&amp;interface=print&amp;showfn=yes&amp;showxref">Isa 28:2, 17</a>. 
</blockquote>
<p>'A 
deluge' stands for being plunged into falsities, and so for undergoing vastation of truth, <a href="705.htm">705</a>, <a href="739.htm">739</a>, <a href="790.htm">790</a>, <a href="5725.htm">5725</a>, <a href="6853.htm">6853</a>, 'a deluge of hail' for the destruction of truth by means of falsities. In David, </p>
<blockquote>
He 
struck their vine with hail, and their sycamore-fig trees with heavy hail. And He gave up<A name="fntext3"></a><A href="#fn3"><sup>c</sup></a> their beasts to the hail, and their flocks to coals of fire. He let loose on them His fierce anger. 
<a href="http://bible.gospelcom.net/cgi-bin/bible?passage=Ps%2078:47-49&amp;version=ESV&amp;interface=print&amp;showfn=yes&amp;showxref">Ps 78:47-49</a>. 
</blockquote>
<p></p>
<p><b>[5]</b>
 In the same author, </p>
<blockquote>
He made their rain into hail, a flaming fire in their land; and He struck their vines and their fig trees, and broke to pieces the trees of their borders. 
<a href="http://bible.gospelcom.net/cgi-bin/bible?passage=Ps%20105:32,%2033&amp;version=ESV&amp;interface=print&amp;showfn=yes&amp;showxref">Ps 105:32, 33</a>. 
</blockquote>
<p>'Hail' and 'rain' stand for the laying waste of truth and good by means of falsities arising from evil. 'Vine' stands for the truth and goodness of the internal Church, 'sycamore-fig' 
and 'fig' for the truths and forms of good of the external Church. In the same author, </p>
<blockquote>
He who gives snow like wool, He sprinkles the hear-frost like dust; He who discharges His hail like balls 
- who can stand before His cold? <a href="http://bible.gospelcom.net/cgi-bin/bible?passage=Ps%20147:16,%2017&amp;version=ESV&amp;interface=print&amp;showfn=yes&amp;showxref">Ps 147:16, 17</a>. 
</blockquote>
<p>'Hail' stands for falsities arising from evils. In the same author, </p>
<blockquote>
He made darkness His hiding-place, and His surroundings His tent - darkness of 
waters, clouds of the heavens. From the brightness before Him, clouds passed with hail and coals of fire. Jehovah thundered in the heavens, and the Most High uttered His voice, hail, and coals of fire, 
so that He sent His arrows and scattered them. <a href="http://bible.gospelcom.net/cgi-bin/bible?passage=Ps%2018:11-14&amp;version=ESV&amp;interface=print&amp;showfn=yes&amp;showxref">Ps 18:11-14</a>. 
</blockquote>
<p>'Hail' stands for falsities arising from evils which lay waste truths and forms of good.  </p>
<p></p>
<p><b>[6]</b>
 In John, </p>
<blockquote>
The first angel sounded 
and there came hail, and fire mixed with blood; and it fell onto the earth so that a third part of the trees were burned, and all green grass was burned up. <a href="http://bible.gospelcom.net/cgi-bin/bible?passage=Rev%208:7&amp;version=ESV&amp;interface=print&amp;showfn=yes&amp;showxref">Rev 8:7</a>. 
</blockquote>
<p>'Hail' stands for falsities arising 
from evil; 'fire mixed with blood' stands for evil desires together with falsified truths; 'the trees which were burned' stands for cognitions of truth that were destroyed by evil desires; and 
'the green grass that was burned up' stands for known facts about truth that were destroyed in a similar way. For the meaning of 'fire' as evil desires, see <a href="1297.htm">1297</a>, <a href="1861.htm">1861</a>, <a href="2446.htm">2446</a>, <a href="5071.htm">5071</a>, <a href="5215.htm">5215</a>, <a href="6314.htm">6314</a>, <a href="6832.htm">6832</a>, <a href="7314.htm">7314</a>;

<p></p>
<p><b>[7]</b>
 In Joshua, </p>
<blockquote>
It happened, when they fled before Israel on the descent of Beth Horon, 
that Jehovah cast down on them large [hail]stones from heaven, as far as Azekah, so that they died. Those who died from the hailstones were more than those whom the children of Israel killed with the 
sword. <a href="http://bible.gospelcom.net/cgi-bin/bible?passage=Josh%2010:11&amp;version=ESV&amp;interface=print&amp;showfn=yes&amp;showxref">Josh 10:11</a>. 
</blockquote>
<p>This refers to the five kings who camped against Gibeon. These kings and their peoples represented those who, being steeped in falsities arising from evils, therefore died from 
the hailstones. Balls of hail are called stones because 'stones' too mean falsities. </p>
<p>From all this one may see what is meant by 'hail' and by 'rain in the form of hail', namely falsities arising from 
evils. And since these falsities are meant, the laying waste of truth and good is also meant, for falsities arising from evils are what lay them waste.

a falsis; sed `grando' hic et in supra allegato loco in lingua originali 4 alia voce exprimitur quae significat grandinem magnam: apud Esaiam, Tunc audiri faciet Jehovah gloriam vocis Suae, et quietem 
brachium Ipsius videbit, in indignatione irae, et flamma ignis comedentis, dispersione et inundatione, et lapide grandinis, xxx 30, 31; </p>
<p>`lapis grandinis' pro vastatione veri per falsa: apud eundem, Ecce 
fortis et robustus est Dominus, sicut inundatio grandinis, procella caedis, sicut inundatio aquarum validarum inundantium dejiciet in terram manu; evertet grando refugium mendacii, et latibulum 
{5}aquarum inundabunt, (x)xxviii 2, 17; </p>
<p>`inundatio' pro immersione in falsa, et sic pro vastatione veri, n. 705, 739, 790, 5725, (x)6853; `inundatio grandinis' pro destructione veri per falsa: apud 
Davidem, Percussit grandine vitem illorum, et sycomora illorum grandine gravi; et conclusit grandini bestiam illorum, et pecora illorum prunis, misit in illos excandescentiam irae Suae, Ps. lxxviii 47-49: </p>
<p>5 
apud eundem, Dedit pluvias illorum grandinem, ignem flammeum in terra illorum, et percussit vitem illorum et ficum illorum, et confregit arborem termini illorum, Ps. cv 32, 33; </p>
<p>`grando et pluvia 
{6}' pro vastatione veri et boni per falsa ex malo; `vitis' pro vero et bono Ecclesiae internae; `sycomora et ficus' pro {7}veris et bonis Ecclesiae externae: apud eundem, Qui dat nivem sicut lanam, 
pruinam sicut pulverem spargit, qui projicit grandinem Suam sicut bolos, coram frigore illius quis consistet?  Ps. cxlvii 16, 17; </p>
<p>`grando' pro falsis ex malis: apud eundem, Posuit tenebras latibulum 
Suum, circuitus Suos tentorium Suum, tenebrae aquarum, nubes caelorum; a splendore ante Ipsum, nubes transiverunt, grandine et prunis ignis; tonavit in caelis Jehovah, et Altissimus dedit vocem 
Suam, grandinem et prunas ignis, ita ut miserit tela {8} et disperserit illos, Ps. xviii 12-15 [A.V. 11-14]; </p>
<p>`grando' pro falsis ex malis quae vastant vera et bona {9}: apud 6 Johannem, Primus angelus 
clanxit, et facta est grando et Ignis mixtus sanguine, et cecidit super terram, ita ut tertia pars arborum combusta sit, et omne gramen viride exustum, Apoc. viii 7; </p>
<p>`grando' pro falsis ex malo; 
`ignis mixtus sanguine' pro malo cupiditatum {10}cum falsificatis veris; `arbores quae combustae' pro cognitionibus veri a malo cupiditatum deperditis; `gramen viride quod exustum pro scientificis veri 
similiter deperditis; quod `ignis' sit malum cupiditatum, videatur n. 1297, 1861, 2446, 5071, 5215, 6314, 6832, 7324; quod `sanguis' sit falsificatum verum, n. 4735, (x)6978, 7317, 7326; `arbores' quod 
sint cognitiones, n. 2722 fin., 2972 apud Joschuam, 7 Factum est, cum fugerent coram Israele illi in descensu Bethchoronis, quando Jehovah projecit super illos lapides magnos e caelis, usque ad Asekam, 
ut morerentur; plures qui mortui sunt lapidibus grandinis quam quos occiderunt filii Israelis gladio, x 11; </p>
<p>ibi de quinque regibus qui contra Gibeonem; per reges illos et per populum illorum repraesentati 
sunt qui in falsis ex malis, inde `lapidibus grandinis' mortui sunt; grandinis boli dicuntur lapides, quia `lapides' etiam significant falsa.  (m)Ex his patet quid per `grandinem et pluviam 
grandinis' significatur, quod nempe falsa ex malis, et quia haec, etiam significatur vastatio veri et boni, nam per falsa ex malis fit illa vastatio.(n) 	@1 tum$ 	@2 i enim$ 	@3 i a Domino$ 	@4
