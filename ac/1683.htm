<h3 align="center" class="ired">属天的奥秘 第1683节</h3>
<h4 align="center"></h4><p><strong>1683.</strong>“与他们摆阵交战”表他们发起进攻。这从“摆阵交战”的含义清楚可知，“摆阵交战”表斗争。因为经上说（3节），他们背叛了。这从以下事实也明显可知：恶灵就是那些发起进攻的人。因为情况是这样：主从不开启与任何地狱的争战，而是地狱攻击祂。这和处于试探，或与恶灵争战的每个人的情形一样。就人的情形而言，天使从不发起进攻，一直不断发起进攻的是恶者或地狱灵。天使只是抵挡和防御。这种性情出自主，主从不愿以邪恶折磨任何人，或将他推入地狱，哪怕他是最坏和最苦毒的仇敌。是这个人自招邪恶，将自己抛入地狱。这也可从邪恶和良善的各自性质推知。邪恶的性质是渴望虐待每个人；而良善的性质是渴望不伤害任何人。恶者在攻击时，实际上是正本着自己的生命行事，因为他们不断渴望毁灭。而善者在不攻击任何人，只是用来保护他人免于伤害时，也正本着自己的生命行事。</p>

<p><strong>[NCE]1683.</strong> The meaning of marshaled the battle with them as the fact that they attacked can be seen from the symbolism of marshaling a battle as making an assault, since verse <a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_1683/bible_king-james-version_genesis_14_4" target=_top>4</a> above says that they rebelled. These words also demonstrate that evil spirits are the ones who attack. The case is that the Lord never initiated a fight with any hell; the hells attacked him. This is also what happens to each of us when we are being tested, that is, when we fight evil spirits. With us, angels never mount an attack, but the evil, hellish spirits never stop attacking. Angels only deflect and defend against the attacks. This comes from the Lord, who never wants to hurt anyone or force anyone down into hell, not even the worst or most hostile of all his enemies. It is actually his enemies who hurt themselves and hurl themselves into hell.<br />This situation also follows from the nature of evil and the nature of goodness. Evil by its nature wants to wound everyone; goodness by its nature wants to hurt no one. The evil feel they are fully alive when they go on the offensive, because they are always wanting to destroy. The good feel they are fully alive when they are not attacking anyone but are taking advantage of the opportunity to help others by protecting them from evil. </p>

They set the battle in array with them. That this signifies that they began the attack, is evident from the signification of "setting the battle in array," as meaning to fight against; for it is said 
above (verse 3) that they rebelled. The same is evident also from the fact that evil spirits are those who make the assault. For it is the case that the Lord never began the combat with any hell, but 
the hells assaulted Him; as is also the case with every man who is in temptation, or In combat with evil spirits. In man's case the angels never make the assault, but always and continually the evil 
or infernal spirits do so; the angels only ward off and defend. This comes from the Lord, who never desires to bring evil upon anyone, or to thrust him down into hell, even if he were the worst and the 
most bitter enemy of all; but it is he who brings the evil upon himself, and precipitates himself into hell. This also follows from the nature of evil, and from the nature of good. It is the nature 
of evil to desire to maltreat everyone; but that of good to desire to maltreat no one. The evil are in their very life when they are assaulting; for they continually desire to destroy. The good are in 
their very life when they are assaulting no one, and when they can be of use in defending others from evils. </p>

That 'they drew up for battle with them' means that they made an attack is clear from the meaning of 'drawing up for battle' as making an assault, for in verses 3, 4 above it is said that they rebelled. 
The same is also evident from the consideration that evil spirits are the ones who attack. For the truth of the matter is that the Lord never began the conflict with any hell, but that the hells attacked 
Him, as is also the case with everyone who undergoes temptation, that is, is engaged in conflict with evil spirits. Never in man's case do the angels make the attack, but it is always and constantly 
the evil or hellish spirits who do so. The angels merely ward off and defend. This disposition comes from the Lord, who never wishes to afflict anyone with evil or thrust him down into hell, not 
even if he were the worst and bitterest enemy of all. It is the person who afflicts himself with evil and so rushes into hell. This also follows from the very nature of evil and the very nature of good. 
The inherent nature of evil is to wish to injure everyone, but the inherent nature of good is to injure none. The evil are acting in conformity with their own life when they are attacking, for their 
constant desire is to destroy. The good are acting in conformity with their own life when they attack nobody, and when they can be of use in defending others from evils. </p>

</p><b>1683.</b>
Quod 'ordinaverunt cum iis praelium' significet quod aggressi, constat ex significatione 'ordinare praelium' quod sit oppugnare, nam quod ii rebellaverint, dicitur supra vers. 3; patet quoque ex eo 
quod mali spiritus sint qui aggrediuntur; ita eram se res habet: Dominus nusquam cum aliquo inferno incohavit pugnam, sed inferna Ipsum aggressa sunt; ut fit quoque apud unumquemvis hominem qui in tentatione 
est, seu in pugna cum malis spiritibus; apud eum nusquam angeli aggrediuntur, sed semper et continue mali seu infernales spiritus; angeli solum avertunt et defendunt; hoc venit a Domino, qui nusquam 
alicui, si vel foret omnium pessimus et infensissimus hostis, malum inferre vult aut eum detrudere in infernum, sed is est qui sibi malum infert, et praecipitat in infernum: hoc quoque sequitur 
a natura mali et a natura boni; natura mali est ut unumquemvis lacessere velit; natura boni est ut nullum; mali in ipsamet sua vita sunt cum aggrediuntur, continue enim cupiunt perdere; boni in ipsamet 
sua vita sunt cum neminem aggrediuntur, et cum usum praestare possunt alios a malis defendendo. </p>
