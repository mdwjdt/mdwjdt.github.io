<h3 align="center" class="ired">属天的奥秘 第3309节</h3>
<h4 align="center"></h4><p><strong>3309.</strong>“以扫是擅长打猎的男人”表源于感官和记忆知识之真理的生活良善。为从“以扫”的代表和“擅长打猎的男人”的含义清楚可知：前面已说明，“以扫”是指生活的良善；下文将说明，“擅长打猎的男人”是指那些具有对真理的情感之人。因为“擅长”论及对真理的情感，或那些具有对真理的情感之人；而“打猎”表真理本身，不过，这些真理属于属世人，良善源于它们。由于属世人的真理就是那些所谓的记忆知识（<a href="3293.htm">3293</a>节），而这些真理主要分为两类或两等，即感官真理和记忆知识形式的真理，这二者在此由“打猎”来表示。感官真理是指孩子所具有的那些真理，记忆知识形式的真理则是他们渐渐长大时所具有的真理。在接受感官真理之前，谁都不可能具有记忆知识的真理，因为构成记忆知识真理的观念是从感官真理获得的，然后人通过这些记忆知识的真理学习并领悟其它更为内在的真理，也就是所谓的教义真理，下一节将说明，教义真理由“田野的人”来表示。<br />“打猎”表示感官和记忆知识的真理，它们被教导给那些具有生活的良善并对这些真理拥有情感的人。这是因为从广泛意义上说，“打猎”表示通过打猎所捕获的动物，如公绵羊、公山羊、母山羊等等；这些动物表示属灵的良善（参看<a href="2180.htm">2180</a>，<a href="2830.htm">2830</a>节）；还因为用于打猎的武器，就是箭囊、弓和标枪，表示真理的教义（<a href="2685.htm">2685</a>，<a href="2686.htm">2686</a>，<a href="2709.htm">2709</a>节）。这些就是“打猎”所表示的事物，这一点从下面27章他父亲以撒对以扫所说的话明显看出来：<br />现在拿你的器械，就是箭囊和弓，往田野去为我打点猎物，照我所爱的给我作成美味。（创世记<a href="http://39-27.cn/创27.3.htm">27:3</a>-<a href="http://39-27.cn/创27.4.htm">4</a>）<br />还可从这一章向扮成以扫的雅各所说的话明显看出来：<br />你拿近前来给我，我好吃我儿子的野味，我的灵魂给你祝福。（创世记<a href="http://39-27.cn/创27.25.htm">27:25</a>）<br />由此明显可知“打猎”或“猎物”表示什么。<br />因此，“打猎”表示教导（真理）和说服（虚假），具有这两种意义，也就是说，出于对真理的情感或对虚假的情感行事。出于对真理的情感行事在耶利米书中有所描述：<br />我要领他们回到他们的本地，就是我从前赐给他们列祖的；看哪，我要差人去召许多渔夫，把他们捕上来；然后我要差人去召许多打猎的，从各大山、小山和岩石的裂缝里猎取他们。（耶利米书<a href="http://39-27.cn/耶16.15.htm">16:15</a>-<a href="http://39-27.cn/耶16.16.htm">16</a>）<br />“渔夫”表那些通过感官真理进行教导的人（<a href="40.htm">40</a>，<a href="991.htm">991</a>节）；“打猎的”表那些通过记忆知识的真理，以及教义进行教导的人。“从各大山、小山”表教导那些具有对良善的情感和对真理的情感之人。“大山、小山”就具有这种含义（参看<a href="795.htm">795</a>，<a href="796.htm">796</a>，<a href="1430.htm">1430</a>节）。“往田野打猎”（如创世记<a href="http://39-27.cn/创27.3.htm">27:3</a>）也具有同样的含义。“打猎”还表示出于对虚假的情感进行说服，这在以西结书中有所描述：<br />看哪！我与你们的靠枕反对，就是你们用以猎取灵魂、使它们如鸟飞走的。我也必撕裂你们的头巾，救我百姓脱离你们的手，使他们不再被猎取，落在你们手中。（以西结书<a href="http://39-27.cn/结13.20.htm">13:20</a>-<a href="http://39-27.cn/结13.21.htm">21</a>）<br />关于“猎取”或“打猎”在这层意义上的含义，可参看1178节；不过，“网罗”通常与这类打猎联系在一起。</p>

<p align="center"><b>Potts(1905-1910) 3309</b></p><p><b>3309.</b>
And Esau was a man skillful [sciens] in hunting. That this signifies the good of life from truths sensuous and of memory-knowledge, is evident from the representation of Esau, as being the good of life 
(concerning which see above); and from the signification of a "man skillful in hunting," as being those who are in the affection of truth (concerning which hereafter). For a "man skillful" is predicated 
of the affection of truth, or of those who are in the affection of truth; whereas "hunting" signifies the truths themselves, but truths which are of the natural man from which are goods. And as 
the truths of the natural man are those which are called memory-knowledges (n. 3293); and these are chiefly of two kinds or degrees, namely, sensuous truths, and truths in the form of memory-knowledge, 
both are here signified by "hunting." Sensuous truths are those in which children are, and truths in the form of memory-knowledge are those in which the same children are as they grow up. For no one 
can be in truths of memory-knowledge unless he is first in sensuous truths, inasmuch as the ideas of the former are procured from the latter; and from these may afterwards be learned and comprehended 
truths still more interior, which are called doctrinal truths, and which are signified by a "man of the field" (concerning which presently).  [2] That by "hunting" are signified truths sensuous and 
of memory-knowledge, in which are instructed and by which are affected those who are in the good of life, is because "hunting," in a wide sense, means the things taken by hunting; such as rams, kids, 
she-goats, and the like; and which are spiritual goods, as may be seen above (n. 2180, 2830); and also because the arms used in hunting, which were quivers, bows, and darts, signify the doctrinal things 
of truth (n. 2685, 2686, 2709). That such are the things which are signified by "hunting," is evident from what is said to Esau by his father Isaac in a subsequent chapter: </p>
<p>     Take I pray thy weapons, 
thy quiver and thy bow, and go out to the field, and hunt me a hunting, and make me savory meat, such as I have loved (Gen. 27:3-4); </p>
<p>and to Jacob, who is there taken for Esau, in the same chapter: </p>
<p> 
    Bring to me that I may eat of my son's hunting, that my soul may bless thee (Gen. 27:25); </p>
<p>from which it is evident what is signified by "hunting." [3] Hence it is that to "hunt" signifies 
to teach and also to persuade, and this in both senses, that is, from the affection of truth, and from the affection of falsity; from the affection of truth in Jeremiah: </p>
<p>     I will bring them back 
into their land that I gave unto their fathers; behold I will send for many fishers, saith Jehovah, and they shall fish them; and after this I will send for many hunters, and they shall hunt them from 
every mountain and from every hill, and out of the clefts of the rocks (Jer. 16:15-16); </p>
<p>where "fishers" denote those who teach from sensuous truths (n. 40, 991); and "hunters," those who teach from 
truths of memory-knowledge, and also from doctrinal things. "Upon every mountain and upon every hill," signifies teaching those who are in the affection of good and in the affection of truth. That "mountain 
and hill" have this signification may be seen above (n. 795, 796, 1430). The like is involved in "hunting in the field" (as in Gen. 27:3). That "hunting" signifies also persuading from the affection 
of falsity, appears in Ezekiel: </p>
<p>     Behold I am against your pillows, wherewith ye there hunt the souls to make them fly away, and I will tear off your coverings, and will deliver My people out 
of your hand, and they shall be no longer in your hand to be hunted (Ezek. 13:20-21). Concerning the signification of "hunting" in this sense, see n. 1178; but to this kind of hunting, "nets" are usually 
attributed. </p>

<p align="center"><b>Elliott(1983-1999) 3309</b></p><p><b>3309.</b>
'And Esau was a man skilled in hunting' means the good of life that has its origin in sensory truths and factual truths. This is clear from the representation of 'Esau' as the good of life, dealt with 
above, and from the meaning of 'a man skilled in hunting' as those who have the affection for truth, dealt with in what follows - for 'a skilled man' has reference to the affection for truth, that is, 
to those who have that affection for truth, whereas 'hunting' means truths themselves, though truths which belong to the natural man and in which goods have their origin. Now because the truths of 
the natural man are called factual, <a href="3293.htm">3293</a>, and factual truths are primarily of two kinds or two degrees - sensory and factual proper - 'hunting' here means both of these. Sensory truths occur with children, 
factual with those same children when they are growing up, for factual truths cannot exist with anyone before he has received sensory truths because the ideas that make up factual truths are acquired 
from sensory truths. Then, from those factual truths, other truths even more interior can be learned and grasped, which are called matters of doctrine, meant by 'a man of the field', dealt with 
below in the next paragraph. </p>
<p></p>
<p><b>[2]</b>
 The reason why 'hunting' means the sensory truths and factual truths that are taught to those in whom the good of life is present and who have the affection for those 
truths is that the word 'hunting' in a broad sense refers to creatures caught through hunting, such as rams, he-goats, she-goats, and the like, by which are meant spiritual goods, see <a href="2180.htm">2180</a>, <a href="2830.htm">2830</a>; and 
also because the weapons used in hunting, which were the quiver, the bow, and darts, mean matters of doctrine upholding what is true, <a href="2685.htm">2685</a>, <a href="2686.htm">2686</a>, <a href="2709.htm">2709</a>. These are the things meant by 'hunting', as may 
be seen from what Isaac his father told Esau, in Chapter <a href="27.htm">27</a> below, </p>
<blockquote>
Take now your weapons, your quiver and your bow, and go out to the field and hunt venison for me, and make me savoury food such 
as I love. <a href="http://bible.gospelcom.net/cgi-bin/bible?passage=Gen%2027:3,%204&amp;version=ESV&amp;interface=print&amp;showfn=yes&amp;showxref">Gen 27:3, 4</a>; </p>
<p> and, in the same chapter, from what he told Jacob, who was posing as Esau, </p>
<p>Bring it to me that I may eat from my son's venison, so that my soul may bless you. <a href="http://bible.gospelcom.net/cgi-bin/bible?passage=Gen%2027:25&amp;version=ESV&amp;interface=print&amp;showfn=yes&amp;showxref">Gen 27:25</a>. 
</blockquote>
<p>These 
quotations show what 'hunting' or 'venison' means. </p>
<p></p>
<p><b>[3]</b>
 Consequently 'hunting' is teaching [what is true] or else inducing a belief in what is false, and in both senses, that is to say, 
acting from an affection for truth or from an affection for falsity. Acting from an affection for truth is described in Jeremiah, </p>
<blockquote>
I will bring them back over their land which I gave to their fathers. 
Behold, I am sending to many fishermen, and they will fish them; and after that I will send to many hunters and they will hunt them from upon every mountain, and from upon every hill, and from the 
holes in the rocks. <a href="http://bible.gospelcom.net/cgi-bin/bible?passage=Jer%2016:15,%2016&amp;version=ESV&amp;interface=print&amp;showfn=yes&amp;showxref">Jer 16:15, 16</a>. 
</blockquote>
<p>'Fishermen' stands for those whose teaching is drawn from sensory truths, <a href="40.htm">40</a>, <a href="991.htm">991</a>, 'hunters' those whose teaching is drawn from factual truths, and also from matters 
of doctrine. 'Upon every mountain, and upon every hill' stands for teaching people who are stirred by the affection for good and by the affection for truth - 'mountain' and 'hill' carrying such meanings, 
see <a href="795.htm">795</a>, <a href="796.htm">796</a>, <a href="1430.htm">1430</a>. 'Hunting in the field', as in <a href="http://bible.gospelcom.net/cgi-bin/bible?passage=Gen%2027:3&amp;version=ESV&amp;interface=print&amp;showfn=yes&amp;showxref">Gen 27:3</a>, implies the same. Inducing others to believe what is false and doing so from the affection for falsity is described in Ezekiel, </p>
<p>Behold, 
I am against your little pillows with which you there hunt the souls to make them fly away, and I will tear them from on your arms, and I will let the souls go that you hunt, souls to fly away; 
and I will tear off your veils and deliver My people out of your hand, and they will be no more in your hand to be hunted. <a href="http://bible.gospelcom.net/cgi-bin/bible?passage=Ezek%2013:18-21&amp;version=ESV&amp;interface=print&amp;showfn=yes&amp;showxref">Ezek 13:18-21</a>. </p>
<p>For the meaning of 'hunting' in this sense, see <a href="1178.htm">1178</a>, though 
nets are normally associated with this type of hunting. </p>

`Et fuit Esau vir sciens venationis': quod significet bonum vitae ex veris sensualibus et scientificis, constat ex repraesentatione `Esavi' quod sit bonum vitae, de qua supra; et ex significatione `viri 
scientis venationem' quod sint illi qui in affectione veri, de qua sequitur; `vir' enim `sciens' praedicatur de affectione veri, seu {1}de illis qui in affectione veri sunt; `venatio' autem significat 
ipsa vera, sed vera quae sunt naturalis hominis ex quibus bona; et quia vera naturalis hominis sunt illa quae vocantur scientifica, n. 3293, et scientifica sunt imprimis duplicis generis seu duplicis 
gradus, nempe sensualia et scientifica, per `venationem' hic significantur utraque; sensualia sunt in quibus {2}pueri, scientifica in quibus iidem cum adolescunt; nullus enim potest esse in veris 
scientificis nisi prius sit in veris sensualibus, nam ideae scientificorum ab his comparantur; ex his dein vera adhuc interiora possunt addisci et capi, quae vocantur doctrinalia, quae significantur 
per `virum agri,' de quibus mox sequitur. [2] Quod per `venationem' significentur vera sensualia et scientifica, in quibus docentur, et quibus afficiuntur illi qui in bono vitae sunt, est {3}quia venatio 
in lato sensu sunt illa quae per venationem capiuntur, ut arietes, haedi, caprae, et similia, quae quod sint bona spiritualia, videatur n. (x)2180, 2830; et quia etiam venationis arma, quae fuerunt 
pharetra, arcus et jacula, sunt doctrinalia veri, n. (x)2685, 2686, 2709; {4}quod talia sint quae per venationem significantur, constare potest ex illis quae ad Esavum a patre ejus Jishako capite sequente 
xxvii, dicuntur,           Tolle quaeso arma tua, pharetram tuam, et arcum Num, et      exi agrum, et venare mihi venationem, et fac mihi cupedias,      quemadmodum amavi, vers. 3, 4: </p>
<p>et ad 
Jacobum, qui ibi pro Esavo, in eodem capite,           Adfer mihi ut edam e venatione filii mei, ideo ut      benedicat tibi anima mea, vers. 25; </p>
<p>ex quibus patet quid per venationem significatur: 
[3] inde est quod `venari' sit docere, {5}ut et persuadere, et hoc in utroque sensu, nempe ex affectione veri et ex affectione falsi; ex affectione veri apud Jeremiam,           Reducam eos super terram 
eorum, quam dedi patribus eorum; </p>
<p>     ecce Ego mittens ad piscatores multos, et piscabuntur eos; et      post ita, mittam ad multos venatores, et venabuntur eos      desuper omni monte, et desuper 
omni colle, et a foraminibus      petrarum, xvi 15, 16; </p>
<p>`piscatores' pro illis qui ex veris sensualibus docent, n. 40, 991; `venatores' qui ex veris scientificis, et quoque ex doctrinalibus; `super 
omni monte, et super omni colle' pro docere illos qui in affectione boni et in affectione veri sunt; quod `mons et collis' sint illa, videatur n. 795, 796, 1430; simile involvit `venari in agro,' 
ut Gen. xxvii 3: persuadere ex affectione falsi, apud Ezechielem,           Ecce Ego quoad pulvillos vestros, quibus vos venantes ibi      animas ad evolandum, et abrumpam eos desuper brachiis vestris  
    et dimittam animas quas vos venantes, animas ad evolandum et      disrumpam velamina vestra, et eripiam populum Meum e manu      vestra, et non erunt amplius in manu vestra in venationem,  
    xiii 18-21; </p>
<p>de significatione `venationis' in hoc sensu videatur n. 1178; sed {6}hujus generis venationi tribui solent retia.  @1 i quod idem$  @2 i sunt$  @3 quia per Venationem in lato sensu
