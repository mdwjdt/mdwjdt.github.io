<h3 align="center" class="ired">属天的奥秘 第1608节</h3>
<h4 align="center"></h4><p><strong>1608.</strong>“和你的种，直到永远”表要信祂的人。这从“种”的含义清楚可知，“种”表信，事实上表仁之信，如前所述（<a href="255.htm">255</a>，<a href="256.htm">256</a>，<a href="1025.htm">1025</a>节）。天国理应赐给祂的种，即赐给那些信祂的人，这一点从主自己在约翰福音中所说的话非常清楚地看出来：<br />父爱子，已将万有交在祂手里。信子的人有永生；不信子的人不得见永生。（约翰福音<a href="http://39-27.cn/约3.35.htm">3:35</a>，<a href="http://39-27.cn/约3.36.htm">36</a>）<br />同一福音书：<br />凡接待他的，祂就赐他们权柄，作神的儿女。凡信祂名的人，不是从血气生的，不是从情欲生的，也不是从人意生的。（约翰福音<a href="http://39-27.cn/约1.12.htm">1:12</a>，<a href="http://39-27.cn/约1.13.htm">13</a>）<br />由上述经文明显可知何为信或信靠祂，也就是说，凡接待祂，信祂，不是“从情欲生的”，也不是“从人意生的”的人都具有这信。“从情欲生的”是指违背爱与仁之物，因为这就是“情欲”所表示的（<a href="999.htm">999</a>节）；“从人意生的”是指违背源于爱或仁之信的事物，这就是“人”所表示的。事实上，造成分离的，就是情欲和人意，而用来联结的，则是爱及其衍生之信。因此，具有爱及其衍生之信的人才是那些从神生的人。他们因从神而生，故被称为“神的儿女”和“祂的种”，天国被赐给了他们。这些事物就是本节经文，即“凡你看见的一切地，我都要赐给你和你的种，直到永远”所表示的。<br />天国无法被赐予其信缺乏仁爱之人，也就是那些嘴上说有信，却仇恨其邻舍的人。只要愿意思考这个问题，谁都能清楚看出这一点。当仇恨，即地狱构成生命时，这信里面根本没有生命可言。因为地狱唯独由仇恨构成，不是由人所接受的遗传之恨构成，而是由他通过实际生活所获得的仇恨构成。</p><br />

<p><strong>[NCE]1608.</strong> The symbolism of and to your seed forever as the people who would believe in him can be seen from the symbolism of seed as faith, specifically the faith that comes of charity, as discussed earlier, in 搂搂<a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_1608/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_255" target=_top>255</a>, <a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_1608/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_256" target=_top>256</a>, <a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_1608/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_1025" target=_top>1025</a>.<br />The Lord's own words in John make it plain that it was his seed 钬?people believing in him 钬?who would be given the kingdom of heaven:<br />The Father loves the Son and has given everything into his hand. Those who believe in the Son have eternal life; but those who do not believe in the Son will not see life. (<a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_1608/bible_king-james-version_john_3_35-36" target=_top>John 3:35-36</a>)<br />[2] And in the same author:<br />As many as did accept him, to them he gave the power to be God's children, to those believing in his name, not from blood or from the flesh's will or from a man's will. (<a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_1608/bible_king-james-version_john_1_12-13" target=_top>John 1:12-13</a>)<br />These words show what faith is, or belief in the Lord: it exists in people who accept and believe in him not because of the flesh's will or because of a man's will. The will of the flesh means something opposite to love and charity, since flesh symbolizes such an opposite (搂<a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_1608/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_999" target=_top>999</a>); and a man's will means something opposite to the faith that comes of love or charity, which is what a man symbolizes. The flesh's will and a man's will are what divide, but love and the faith that comes of love are what unite. So people who have love and the faith that comes of love are the ones born of God,{*1} and because they are born of God, they are called God's children. They are also his seed who will inherit the kingdom of heaven, as symbolized by the words of the present verse: "All the land that you see I will give to you and to your seed forever."<br />[3] Anyone willing simply to think about it is capable of seeing that the kingdom of heaven cannot be given to people whose faith is devoid of charity, that is, people who say they have faith and yet hate their neighbor. This kind of faith cannot have any life in it, since hatred 钬?hell, in other words 钬?constitutes its life. Hell consists of pure hatred 钬?not the kinds of hatred that we inherit, but the kinds that we secure for ourselves by the way we actually live.<br /><br /><strong>Footnotes:</strong><br />{*1} In referring to "people who are born of God," Swedenborg is quoting a part of <a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_1608/bible_king-james-version_john_1_12-13" target=_top>John 1:12-13</a> that was actually omitted from the condensed quotation just above in the text. The full passage, with the omitted portion emphasized, reads as follows: "As many as did accept him, to them he gave the power to be God's children, to those believing in his name, who had their birth not from blood or from the flesh's will or from a man's will but from God."

<p align="center"><b>Potts(1905-1910) 1608</b></p><p><b>1608.</b>
And to thy seed forever. That this signifies those who should have faith in Him, is evident from the signification of "seed," as being faith, and indeed the faith of charity (spoken of before, n. 255, 
256, 1025). That the heavenly kingdom should be given to His seed, that is, to those who have faith in Him, is clearly evident from the words of the Lord Himself in John: </p>
<blockquote>
	<p>The Father loveth the 
Son,, and hath given all things into His hand he that believeth on the Son hath everlasting life, but he that believeth not the Son shall not see life (John 3:35-36). 
	</p>
</blockquote>
<p>     [2] And again: </p>
<blockquote>
	<p>As many as 
received Him, to them gave He power [potestas] to become the sons of God, to those that believe in His name, who were born not of bloods, nor of the will of the flesh, nor of the will of man (John 1:12-13). 
	</p>
</blockquote>
<p>     From 
these words it is evident what faith, or believing in Him, is, namely, that it is with those who receive Him and believe in Him, not from "the will of the flesh," nor from "the will of man." 
"The will of the flesh" is what is contrary to love and charity, for this is signified by "flesh" (n. 999); and "the will of man" is what is contrary to the faith that is from love or charity, for 
this is what is signified by "man." For the will of the flesh and the will of man are what disjoin; but love and the derivative faith are what conjoin; therefore they in whom are love and the derivative 
faith, are they who are born of God. And because they are born of God, they are called "sons of God," and are His "seed," to whom is given the heavenly kingdom. These things are signified by the 
following words in this verse: "all the land which thou seest, to thee will I give it, and to thy seed, forever."  </p>
<p>     [3] That the heavenly kingdom cannot be given to those who are in faith without charity, 
that is, to those who say that they have faith and yet hold the neighbor in hatred, may be seen by anyone who is willing to reflect; for there can be no life in such faith, when hatred, that is hell, 
constitutes the life. For hell consists of nothing but hatreds; not of the hatreds which a man has received hereditarily, but of those which he has acquired by actual life. </p>

<p align="center"><b>Elliott(1983-1999) 1608</b></p><p><b>1608.</b>
'And to your seed even for ever' means people who were to have faith in Him. This is clear from the meaning of 'seed' as faith, and indeed faith that is the expression of charity, dealt with already 
in <a href="255.htm">255</a>, <a href="256.htm">256</a>, <a href="1025.htm">1025</a>. That it was to His 'seed', that is, to those who have faith in Him, that the heavenly kingdom would be given, is quite clear from the Lord's own words in John, </p>
<blockquote>
The Father loves the 
Son and has given all things into His hand. He who believes in the Son has eternal life; but he who does not believe in the Son will not see life. <a href="http://bible.gospelcom.net/cgi-bin/bible?passage=John%203:35,%2036&amp;version=ESV&amp;interface=print&amp;showfn=yes&amp;showxref">John 3:35, 36</a>. 
</blockquote>
<p></p>
<p><b>[2]</b>
 And in the same gospel, </p>
<blockquote>
As 
many as received Him, to them He gave power to be sons of God, to those believing in His name, who were born not of blood, nor of the will of the flesh, nor of the will of man. <a href="http://bible.gospelcom.net/cgi-bin/bible?passage=John%201:12,%2013&amp;version=ESV&amp;interface=print&amp;showfn=yes&amp;showxref">John 1:12, 13</a>. 
</blockquote>
<p>From 
these places it is clear what faith, or believing in Him, is, that is to say, that it resides with those who receive Him and believe in Him, and who are born 'not of the will of the flesh nor of the 
will of man'. 'The will of the flesh' is that which-is contrary to love and charity, for that is what 'flesh'' means, <a href="999.htm">999</a>; and 'the will of man (vir)' is that which is contrary to faith stemming from 
love or charity, for this is what 'man' means. Indeed the will of the flesh and the will of man are such as cause division, whereas love and the faith that comes from it are such as serve to join. People 
therefore with whom love and the faith that comes from it reside are those who are 'born of God'. And because they are born of God they are called 'the sons of God' and are His 'seed' to whom the 
heavenly kingdom is given, which is the meaning in this verse of the statement, 'All the land which you see I will give to you, and to your seed even for ever'. </p>
<p></p>
<p><b>[3]</b>
 The fact that the heavenly kingdom 
cannot be given to people whose faith is devoid of charity, that is, who say they have faith but hate their neighbour, may become clear to anyone provided he is willing to reflect on the matter. For 
there can be no life to such faith when hatred, that is, hell, constitutes the life, for hell consists solely of forms of hatred, not of those forms of it which a person receives through heredity but 
of the forms of the hatred which he has acquired to himself through his own actions in life. </p>

</p><b>1608.</b>
'Et semini tuo usque in aeternum': quod significet illos qui fidem in Ipsum haberent, constat ex significatione 'seminis' quod sit fides, et quidem fides charitatis, de qua prius n. 255, 256, 1025. 
 Quod 'semini Ipsius,' hoc est, fidem habentibus in Ipsum, 'daretur regnum caeleste,' constat manifeste ex Ipsius Domini verbis apud Johannem, 	Pater amat Filium, et omnia dedit Ei in manum Ipsius: qui 
credit in Filium, habet vitam aeternam; qui vero non credit Filio non videbit vitam, iii 35, 36: </p>
<p>[2] et apud eundem, 	Quotquot receperunt Ipsum, dedit illis potestatem, ut filii Dei essent; credentibus 
in nomen Ipsius, qui non ex sanguinibus, neque e voluntate carnis, neque e voluntate viri, i 12, 13; </p>
<p>ex his constat quid sit fides seu 'credere in Ipsum,' nempe apud illos qui recipiunt Ipsum 
et credunt in Ipsum, 'non ex voluntate viri'; nec e voluntate viri'; 'voluntas carnis' est quod est contrarium amori et charitati, nam id significatur per 'carnem,' n. 999; et 'voluntas viri' est quod 
est contrarium fidei ex amore seu charitate, hoc est quod significatur per 'virum'; voluntas enim carnis et voluntas viri sunt quae disjungunt, sed amor et inde fides sunt quae conjungunt; quare apud 
quos amor et inde fides, illi sunt qui 'ex Deo nati'; et quia illi ex Deo nati, appellantur 'filii Dei' et sunt 'semen Ipsius quibus regnum caeleste'; quae significantur per haec in hoc versu, 'omnem 
terram quam tu vides, tibi dabo, et semini tuo usque in aeternum.'  [3] Quod regnum caeleste non dari queat illis qui in fide absque charitate sunt, hoc est, illis qui se dicunt habere fidem, et odio 
habent proximum, unicuique si modo reflectere velit, constare potest; nam nulla vita potest fidei tali inesse, cum vitam facit odium hoc est, infernum; nam infernum non nisi ex odiis consistit, non ex 
odiis quae homo hereditario accepit, sed ex odiis quae ipse actuali vita sibi comparavit. </p>
