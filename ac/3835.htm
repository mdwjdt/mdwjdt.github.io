<h3 align="center" class="ired">属天的奥秘 第3835节</h3>
<h4 align="center"></h4><p><strong>3835.</strong>“拉班又将婢女悉帕给女儿利亚作婢女”表作为服务手段的外在情感或外在纽带。这从“婢女”的含义清楚可知，“婢女”是指外在情感（参看<a href="1895.htm">1895</a>，<a href="2567.htm">2567</a>节）。“拉班给她”表示它们源自一个共同家族的旁系良善，因为该良善是这种情感的源头。它们被称为外在纽带，是因为一切情感都是纽带（<a href="1077.htm">1077</a>，<a href="1080.htm">1080</a>，<a href="1835.htm">1835</a>，<a href="1944.htm">1944</a>节）。除了人的情感外，没有什么东西能将他保持在纽带中。每个人的情感在他看来似乎不是一个纽带，然而仍被如此称呼，因为情感主宰他，对他来说就是纽带。然而，内在情感被称为内在纽带，对真理与良善的情感被称为良知的纽带。外在纽带或外在情感与这些相对应，因为一切内在事物都与外在事物有对应关系。由于正在重生的人凭外在事物被引入内在事物，并且这种引入的状态就是此处所论述的主题，故此处经上说，拉班的婢女被送给了他女儿利亚作婢女。这段描述表示这类情感作为引入的手段被赋予。这些情感是最外在的，如那些所谓的肉体情感。这一点从以下事实明显可知，即：“利亚”代表对外在真理的情感。蒙主的神圣怜悯，关于这些问题的详细内容也会在别处出现。</p>

<p align="center"><b>Potts(1905-1910) 3835</b></p><p><b>3835.</b>
And Laban gave her Zilpah his handmaid, unto his daughter Leah for a handmaid. That this signifies the external affections, or external bonds, which are subservient means, is evident from the signification 
of a "handmaid," as being the external affections (see n. 1895, 2567). That "Laban gave her" signifies that they are from the collateral good of a common stock, for this is the origin of such affections. 
They are called external bonds, because all affections are bonds (n. 1077, 1080, 1835, 1944), for nothing holds man in bonds except his affection. The affection of each man does not indeed 
appear to him as a bond, yet still it is so called because it rules him, and keeps him bound to it. Internal affections, however, are called internal bonds, the affections of truth and of good being called 
the bonds of conscience. To these correspond external bonds or external affections, for every internal has a corresponding external. As the man who is being regenerated is introduced to internal 
things by means of external ones, and as this state of introduction is here treated of, therefore it is here said that Laban's handmaid was given to his daughter Leah for a handmaid, by which is signified 
that such affections were given as serve as the means of introduction. That these affections were the most external ones, such as are those called the affections of the body, is evident from the 
fact that Leah represents the affections of external truth. But on this subject also, of the Lord's Divine mercy more elsewhere. </p>

<p align="center"><b>Elliott(1983-1999) 3835</b></p><p><b>3835.</b>
'And Laban gave to her Zilpah his servant-girl - to Leah his daughter to be her servant-girl' means external affections or external bonds which are subservient means. This is clear from the meaning of 
'a servant-girl' as external affections, dealt with in <a href="1895.htm">1895</a>, <a href="2567.htm">2567</a>. Laban's giving her means that they derive from a parallel good springing from a common stock, for this is the source of such affections. 
They are called external bonds because all affections are bonds, see <a href="1077.htm">1077</a>, <a href="1080.htm">1080</a>, <a href="1835.htm">1835</a>, <a href="1944.htm">1944</a>. For nothing else holds someone in bonds than his affection. No person's affection seems to him to be 
a bond, but it is nevertheless called such for the reason that it governs him and is for him binding. Internal affections however are called internal bonds, even as affections for truth and good are called 
the bonds of conscience. External bonds or affections correspond to these, for everything internal possesses a corresponding external. Since it is by means of external things that one who is being 
regenerated is introduced to internal things, and since this state is the subject here, mention is therefore made here of Laban's servant-girl's being given to his daughter Leah as a servant-girl. 
This description means that the kind of affections which served as means were given. The fact that these affections were the most external, like those called bodily affections, is evident from the consideration 
that 'Leah' represents the affections for external truth. But in the Lord's Divine mercy more about these matters too will appear elsewhere. </p>

</p><b>3835.</b>
`Et dedit Laban illi Zilpam ancillam suam, Leae filiae suae ancillam':  quod significet externas affectiones seu externa vincula quae media inservientia, constat ex significatione `ancillae' quod 
sint affectiones externae, de qua n. 1895, 2567; </p>
<p>quod `dederit Laban' significat quod sint ex bono communis stirpis collaterali, inde enim tales affectiones sunt; vocantur illae vincula externa quia 
omnes affectiones sunt vincula, videatur n. 1077, 1080, 1835, 1944; nam nihil aliud tenet hominem in vinculis quam affectio ejus; affectio cujusvis non quidem apparet ei ut vinculum, sed usque ita 
vocatur, ex eo quod regat hominem ac teneat illum sibi vinctum; affectiones autem internae vocantur vincula interna, sicut affectiones veri et boni vincula conscientiae; his correspondent vincula 
externa seu affectiones externae, nam omne internum habet correspondens externum; quia per externa introducitur homo qui regeneratur, ad interna, et hic de statu illo agitur, ideo hic memoratur quod 
`ancilla Labanis data sit Leae filiae in ancillam', quibus significatur quod tales affectiones quae pro mediis inserviunt, quae quod extimae fuerint, quales sunt illae quae vocantur affectiones 
corporis, patet ex eo quod per Leam repraesententur affectiones veri externi; sed de his quoque, ex Divina Domini Misericordia, plura alibi. </p>
