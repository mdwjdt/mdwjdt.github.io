<h3 align="center" class="ired">属天的奥秘 第718节</h3>
<h4 align="center"></h4><p><strong>718.</strong>“一公一母”表示真理与良善结合。这一点可从“男人”和“妻子”的含义明显看出来：男人是属觉知的真理，而妻子则是属意愿的良善，如前所述；也可从以下事实看出来：人没有一丁点思维，也没有一丁点情感和行为，除非其中包含觉知与意愿的某种婚姻。若没有这样一个婚姻，任何事物都不会存在或被产生出来。人体器官，无论复合的，还是简单的，事实上，即便最简单的部位都包含一个主动物和一个被动物。它们若不象婚姻中的男人和妻子那样结合在一起，甚至无法呆在那里，更不用说产生什么东西了。整个自然界都是这样。这些无尽的婚姻的源头和起源就在于天堂的婚姻，因而对主的王国的观念通过这婚姻被铭刻在自然万物中，无论有生气的还是无生气的。</p>

<p><strong>[NCE]718.</strong> The symbolism of man and wife as truth united to goodness is established by the following considerations. A man symbolizes truth, which belongs to the intellect, while a wife symbolizes goodness, which is a matter of will, both of which were treated of earlier.{*1} And a person does not have the smallest particle of thought, the slightest stir of feeling or activity, that does not involve a kind of marriage between intellect and will. Without some kind of marriage, nothing at all is ever produced or comes into existence. The actual organic substances of which we are made, whether taken together or separately, even down to their simplest forms, have in them both a passive and an active nature. If the passive and active did not join together in something that resembles the marriage between a husband and wife, they could not possibly exist in those substances, much less produce anything. This is true throughout the world of nature.{*2} These enduring unions trace their origin and source to the heavenly marriage, which stamps every entity in all of creation, animate or inanimate, with a picture of the Lord's kingdom.<br /><br /><strong>Footnotes:</strong><br />{*1} On the symbolism of a man or husband, and of a woman or wife, see <a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_718/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_158" target=_top>158</a>, <a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_718/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_265" target=_top>265</a>, <a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_718/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_429" target=_top>429</a>, <a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_718/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_476" target=_top>476</a>, <a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_718/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_668" target=_top>668</a>.

[LHC]<br />{*2} The complementary qualities of activeness and passivity entered Western thought most forcefully in the philosophy of Aristotle; see in particular Physics 3:1-3 (200b-202b), where they are utilized to describe motion and change: the mover or changer is active, the moved or changed passive. Over the course of his works, Swedenborg turns to this contrast numerous times to distinguish complementary qualities or forces. In <a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_718/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_4653" target=_top>Secrets of Heaven 4653:1</a>, speech is said to be active, and hearing passive; in 6987, spoken thought is said to be active, and unspoken thought passive; in <a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_718/swedenborg_divine-love-and-wisdom-dole_178" target=_top>Divine Love and Wisdom 178</a>, gases are active and solids are passive; in <a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_718/swedenborg_interaction-of-the-soul-and-body-vickers_11" target=_top>Soul-Body Interaction 11</a>, the spiritual is said to be active and the material to be passive; in <a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_718/swedenborg_true-christian-religion-chadwick_110#subsection-2-6" target=_top>True Christianity 110:6</a>, the Lord is said to be active in us, and by flowing into us, to make us active also — an inflow without which we would be completely passive. Compare also Worship and Love of God 80, where love is defined as the quintessential emotion belonging to the union of active and passive forces. It is interesting to note that although Swedenborg uses marriage here in <a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_718/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_718" target=_top>Secrets of Heaven 718</a> as an indicator of close union, he does not label either party to it as exclusively active or passive.

That by "man [vir] and wife" is signified that the truths were conjoined with goods, is evident from the signification of "man" as being truth, which is of the understanding, and from the signification 
of "wife" as being good, which is of the will (concerning which before), and also from the fact that man has not the least of thought, nor the least of affection and action, in which there is not a 
kind of marriage of the understanding and the will. Without a kind of marriage, nothing ever exists or is produced. In the very organic forms of man, both composite and simple, and even in the most simple, 
there is a passive and an active, which, if they were not coupled as in a marriage, like that of man and wife, could not even be there, still less produce anything, and the case is the same throughout 
universal nature. These incessant marriages derive their source and origin from the heavenly marriage; and thereby there is impressed upon everything in universal nature, both animate and inanimate, 
an idea of the Lord's kingdom. </p>

'Male and mate'<A name="fntext1"></a><A href="#fn1"><sup>a</sup></a> means that truths were joined to goods. This is clear from the meaning of 'man' (vir) as truth which belongs to the understanding, and from the meaning of 'wife' as good which belongs 
to the will, both dealt with already. This consequently means that with man neither the smallest area of thought nor the smallest area of affection or activity has any existence at all unless it contains 
some marriage of understanding and will. In the absence of such a marriage nothing ever comes forth or is produced. The very organs of man's body, in their complex and in their simple parts, and 
indeed in the simplest parts of all, contain that which is passive and that which is active. And if these were not coupled together, like man and wife in marriage, they could not even be there, let alone 
produce anything. The same applies to the whole realm of nature. The source and origin of these enduring marriages lies in the heavenly marriage by means of which also the idea of the Lord's kingdom 
is stamped on everything in the whole realm of nature, both on animate beings and on inanimate.

Quod per 'virum et uxorem' significentur quod vera conjuncta bonis, constat a significatione 'viri' quod sit verum quod est intellectus, et a significatione 'uxoris' quod sit bonum quod voluntatis, 
de quibus prius; et exinde quod nusquam apud hominem detur vel minimum cogitationis, nec minimum affectionis et actionis, in quo non sit quoddam conjugium intellectus et voluntatis; absque quodam conjugio 
nusquam aliquid existit aut producitur; in ipsis organicis hominis compositis et simplicibus, immo simplicissimis, est passivum et activum, quae si non copulata forent quasi conjugio instar viii 
et uxoris, nequicquam possent ibi esse, minus aliquid producere; in universa natura similiter: perpetua haec conjugia ducunt principium et ortum suum a conjugio caelesti, per quod etiam unicuique rei
