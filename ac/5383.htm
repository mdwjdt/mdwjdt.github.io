<h4 align="center"></h4><p><strong>5383.</strong>他们用来检查和探究别人秉性的方法有很多；但我在此只能提及以下几种。他们诱导其他灵人说话（在来世，这种事通过无法描述清楚的流注实现），若被如此诱导出来的话很容易流动，他们就能据此判断这些灵人的秉性。他们还引发一种情感的状态。但以这种方式查究的人是他们中间相当迟钝、粗俗的人。其他灵人则用其它方法。其中有些灵人一靠近别人，就能立刻发觉他的思维、渴望和行为，包括他所做的、让他想起来就感到痛苦的事。这些灵人会紧紧抓住这一点，若觉得有正当理由，还会谴责他。在来世，几乎令世人难以置信的奇事之一是：一旦有灵人靠近别的灵人，尤其靠近某个世人，他立刻就知道其思维与情感，以及他一直在做什么，因而知道他当前的整个状态，就好像他与其在一起很长时间。来世就有这种交流，只是在察觉的形式上有所不同。有些灵人察觉别人的内在思维和情感，有些灵人只察觉别人的外在思维。然而，后者若想知道别人的内在思维和情感，就能利用各种方法去查究它们。</p>

The methods by which they explore or search out the dispositions of others are very numerous; but I may adduce only the following one. They lead other spirits to speak (which in the other life is done 
by an influx that cannot be intelligibly described), and if the speech they have thus led follows readily they judge thereby of the character of the spirits. They also lead into a state of affection. 
But they who explore in this way are among the grosser of them. Others use other methods. There are some of them who on approaching at once perceive another's thoughts, desires, and acts, and also anything 
he has done that pains him to think of: this they seize upon, and also condemn, if they think there is just cause. It is one of the wonders of the other life-incredible to almost all in this world-that 
as soon as any spirit comes to another, and especially when he comes to a man, he instantly knows the other's thoughts and affections and what he has been doing, thus all his present state, 
just as if he had been a long time with him-so perfect is the communication. But there are differences in these perceptions, some spirits perceiving interior things, and others perceiving only exterior 
ones. These latter, if they are in the cupidity of knowing, explore the interiors of others by various methods. </p>

The methods used by them to explore and examine closely the minds of others are very many; but let simply the following be mentioned here. They induce the other spirits to speak, which is effected in 
the next life by means of an influx that defies any intelligible description. If the speech so induced flows readily, they judge from this the character of those other spirits. They also induce a state 
of affection. But those who explore the minds of others in this way are some of the rather obtuse ones. Others however are different, being spirits who discern in an instant, even while they are approaching 
someone, his thoughts, desires, and actions, including any grief felt by him over something he has done. Those spirits seize on such, and if they think the feeling is justified they also condemn 
him. One of the marvels in the next life which scarcely anyone in the world can believe is that as soon as any spirit approaches another spirit, more so when he approaches someone in the world, he 
knows in an instant his thoughts and affections and what he has been doing. Thus he knows the whole of the other's present state, altogether as though he has been constantly in his presence. This kind 
of communication exists there, though there are differences in such forms of discernment Some spirits perceive another's interior thoughts and affections, others perceive solely his exterior ones. 
Yet if the latter wish to know others' interior thoughts and affections, they can employ various methods to explore them. </p>

Modi quibus explorant aut scrutantur aliorum animos, sunt perplures; sed licet solum hunc afferre: adducunt alios spiritus ad loquendum, quod fit in altera vita per influxum, qui non {1} describi ad 
captum potest; si tunc facilis est sequela loquelae inductae, inde judicant quod tales sint; inducunt etiam statum affectionis, at qui ita explorant, sunt inter crassiores; alii vero  aliter; sunt qui 
ilico dum adveniunt, appercipiunt alterius cogitata, desideria et acta, tum {2} quid ei dolori est quod egerat {3}; hoc arripiunt, et si causam autumant justam, quoque damnant. Mirabile est in altera 
vita quod vix {4} aliquis in mundo credere potest, ut primum aliquis spiritus ad alterum venit, et magis cum ad hominem, quod ilico noverit ejus cogitationes et ejus affectiones, et quid tunc egerat, 
ita omnem ejus statum praesentem, prorsus sicut diu apud illum fuisset; talis communicatio est, sed apperceptionum illarum sunt differentiae, sunt qui percipiunt interiora, et sunt qui solum percipiunt 
exteriora, hi {5} in cupiditate sciendi sint {6}, explorant interiora aliorum variis modis. @1 i ita$ @2 et tunc$ @3 sit, quod egerit$ @4 nusquam$ @5 illi$ @6 explorandi sunt$ </p>
