<h4 align="center"></h4><p><strong>958.</strong>有一群精灵四处游荡，其他精灵极其害怕他们。这群精灵集中在后背下部，用来回的快速运动引发痛苦。这种快速运动没人阻止得了，并伴有响声。他们将这种收紧和松开的动作以圆锥体的形式引向上方。凡被引入这个圆锥体，尤其接近其顶端的，无论是谁，其四肢的每一个粒子都会惨遭蹂躏。而被引入其中并因此遭受惩罚的，正是具有欺骗性的伪装者。</p>

<p><strong>[NCE]958.</strong> There are gangs of roving spirits of whom other spirits are intensely afraid. They attach themselves to the lower part of the back and cause pain by a rapid, audible, back-and-forth motion that no one is able to block. It is a pressing, squeezing motion, which they channel upward into the point of a conical shape. Any who are sent inside the cone, especially those near the tip, are wretchedly ripped apart at every joint.<br />It is the imposters who are sent in there and punished in this way. </p>
<p align="center"><b>Potts(1905-1910) 958</b></p><p><b>958.</b>
There are troops of spirits who wander about and whom other spirits greatly dread. They apply themselves to the lower part of the back, and inflict torture by rapid movements to and fro which no one 
can prevent, and which are attended with sound, and they direct the constrictive and expansive movement upward in the form of a cone with its point at the top; and whoever is introduced within this cone, 
especially toward the top of it, is miserably racked in every particle of his limbs. It is deceitful pretenders who are introduced into it and so punished. </p>

<p align="center"><b>Elliott(1983-1999) 958</b></p><p><b>958.</b>
There are bands of spirits wandering about whom other spirits absolutely dread. They concentrate on the lower part of the back, causing agony by rapid movements to and fro which none can prevent and 
which are audible; and they direct their tightening and releasing action upwards in the shape of a cone with the point on top. Whoever is put inside this cone, especially near its apex, is wrenched apart 
pitiably in every single part of his limbs. Those who are put inside it and punished in this manner are deceitful pretenders. </p>

<p align="center"><b>Latin(1748-1756) 958</b>
</p><b>958.</b>
Sunt cohortes spirituum qui circumvagantur, quos spiritus maximopere timent; applicant se parti tergali inferius, torquent per reciprocationes citas, quas nemo potest inhibere, et cum sono, dirigentes 
motum constrictorium et restrictorium versus superiora in modum coni sursum acuminati; quicumque intra conum hunc mittitur, imprimis qui versus apicem ejus, miserabiliter discerpitur quoad singulas 
artuum particulas: sunt simulatores dolosi, qui immittuntur et sic puniuntur. </p>
