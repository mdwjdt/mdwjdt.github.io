<h3 align="center" class="ired">属天的奥秘 第264节</h3>
<h4 align="center"></h4><p><strong>264.</strong>在圣经中，“怀孕生子”当取其内义。其中，“怀孕”表思维和想像，“子”表真理，这从以下经文可知：“至于以法莲人，他们的荣耀必如鸟飞去，必不生产，不怀胎，不成孕。纵然养大儿女，我却必使他们丧子，甚至不留一个。我离弃他们，他们就有祸了。”（何西阿书<a href="http://39-27.cn/何9.11.htm">9:11</a>-<a href="http://39-27.cn/何9.12.htm">12</a>）在此，“以法莲”表觉性，亦即对真理的领悟。“子”表真理。<br />另有一处说到“以法莲”，亦即聪明人，变成了愚昧人：“产妇的疼痛必临到他身上。他是无智慧之子，到了产期不当迟延。”（何西阿书<a href="http://39-27.cn/何13.13.htm">13:13</a>）<br />又如：“西顿哪，你当惭愧！因为大海说，就是海中的保障说，我没有劬劳，也没有生产，没有养育男子，也没有抚养童女。这风声一传到埃及，埃及人为推罗的风声，极其疼痛。”（以赛亚书<a href="http://39-27.cn/赛23.4.htm">23:4</a>-<a href="http://39-27.cn/赛23.5.htm">5</a>）在此，“西顿”表具有信仰认知却被知识破坏而变得“不生育”的人。<br />再如：“锡安未曾劬劳，就生产，未觉疼痛，就生出儿子。这样的事，谁曾听见，谁曾看见呢？地岂能一日生产？耶和华说，我既使他临产，岂不使他生产呢？你的神说，我既使他生产，岂能使他闭胎不生呢？”（以赛亚书<a href="http://39-27.cn/赛66.7.htm">66:7</a>-<a href="http://39-27.cn/赛66.9.htm">9</a>）这是说重生，“子”亦表信之真理。<br />良善和真理成孕、受生于属天的婚姻，故被主称为“子”：“那撒好种的，就是人子。田地，就是世界。好种，就是天堂之子。”（马太福音<a href="http://39-27.cn/太13.37.htm">13:37</a>-<a href="http://39-27.cn/太13.38.htm">38</a>）属于得救之信的良善与真理，主称之为“亚伯拉罕之子”（约翰福音<a href="http://39-27.cn/约8.39.htm">8:39</a>）。因为“种”表信（<a href="255.htm">255</a>节），其所出之“子”自然就是属于信的良善与真理。主也是一样，他就是那“种”，故他自称为“人子”，亦即教会之信。</p>

<p><strong>[NCE]264.</strong> Conception and the bearing of children in the Word are taken only in the spiritual sense — conception as the thought and imagination of the heart, and the children born as true ideas. This may be seen in the following words from Hosea:<br />Ephraim — like a bird will their glory fly away, abandoning birth and the womb and conception. Even if they bring up their children, I will still bereave them, so that not one person is left. Indeed, doom to them, since I will have departed from them. (<a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_264/bible_king-james-version_hosea_9_11-12" target=_top>Hosea 9:11-12</a>)<br />Here Ephraim symbolizes the intelligent, or an intelligent understanding of truth, and the children symbolize the true ideas themselves. Hosea has more of the same to say about Ephraim, or the intelligent person who has lost all sense:<br />The pains of a woman in labor came on him. He is an unwise child, because at the time when children break open the womb, he will not present himself. (<a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_264/bible_king-james-version_hosea_13_13" target=_top>Hosea 13:13</a>)<br />In Isaiah:<br />Blush, Sidon, because the sea, the stronghold of the sea spoke, saying, "I was not in labor, did not give birth, and did not bring up young men or raise young women." As when Egypt receives the news, they will go into labor over the news from Tyre. (<a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_264/bible_king-james-version_isaiah_23_4-5" target=_top>Isaiah 23:4-5</a>)<br />Here Sidon stands for people who had religious knowledge but destroyed it by turning it into mere facts so that it became sterile.<br />[2] In the same prophet:<br />"Before she goes into labor she gives birth, and before pain came on her she delivered a male. Who has heard a thing like this? Who has seen things like those? Does the earth labor for one day and I cause it to give birth?" Jehovah has said. "Am I, the bringer of birth, going to close up [the womb]?" your God has said. (<a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_264/bible_king-james-version_isaiah_66_7-8" target=_top>Isaiah 66:7-8</a>, <a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_264/bible_king-james-version_isaiah_66_9" target=_top>9</a>)<br />This deals with regeneration, and the children again symbolize the true ideas belonging to faith. Things that are good and true, because they are the things conceived and born of the heavenly marriage, are also called children by the Lord in Matthew:<br />The one who sows good seed is the Son of Humankind; the field is the world; but the seeds are the children of the kingdom. (<a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_264/bible_king-james-version_matthew_13_37-38" target=_top>Matthew 13:37-38</a>)<br />In <a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_264/bible_king-james-version_john_8_39" target=_top>John 8:39</a> the Lord calls the goodness and truth that belong to a saving faith the "children of Abraham." Seed, after all (as stated in <a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_264/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_255" target=_top>255</a>), is faith, and therefore children, who come from seed, are the good deeds and true ideas of faith. As a consequence, because the Lord is himself the seed, he called himself the Son of Humankind, meaning the church's faith. </p>
<p align="center"><b>Potts(1905-1910) 264</b></p><p><b>264.</b>
That the "conception and birth of sons" in the Word, are taken in a spiritual sense-"conception" for the thought and device of the heart, and "sons" for truths, is evident from Hosea: </p>
<p>     As for Ephraim, 
their glory shall fly away like a bird, from the birth, and from the womb: and from the conception; though they shall have brought up their sons, yet will I bereave them, that they be not man; 
yea, woe also to them when I depart from them (Hos. 9:11-12), where "Ephraim" signifies the intelligent, or the understanding of truth; and "sons" truths themselves. It is likewise said elsewhere concerning 
Ephraim, or one who is intelligent, who has become foolish: </p>
<p>     The sorrows of one in travail have come upon him, he is an unwise son, for at the time he will not stand in the breach of the 
womb of sons (Hos. 13:13). And in Isaiah: </p>
<p>     Blush, O Zidon, for the sea hath spoken, the fortress of the sea, saying, I have not travailed, nor brought forth, nor have I brought up young men, nor 
caused girls to grow up; as at the report concerning Egypt, they shall bring forth according to the report of Tyre (Isa. 23:4-5), where "Zidon" means those who have been in the knowledges of faith, 
but have destroyed them by memory-knowledges [scientifica], and so have become barren.  [2] Again in the same prophet, treating of regeneration, and where likewise the truths of faith are signified by 
"sons":     Before she travailed she bringeth forth; and before her pain came, she was delivered of a man child; who hath heard such a thing? who hath seen such things? shall the earth bring forth in 
one day? and shall I not cause to bring forth? saith Jehovah; shall I cause to bring forth, and close up? saith thy God (Isa. 66:7-9). Goods and truths, being conceived and born of the heavenly marriage, 
are therefore called "sons" by the Lord in Matthew: </p>
<p>He that soweth the good seed is the Son of man the field is the world and the seed are the sons of the kingdom (Matt. 13:37-38). And the goods 
and truths of a saving faith He calls "sons of Abraham" (John 8:39); for "seed" (as stated n. 255) denotes faith, wherefore "sons" which are of the "seed" are the goods and truths of faith. Hence 
also the Lord, as being Himself the "seed" called Himself the "Son of man" that is, the faith of the church. </p>

<p align="center"><b>Elliott(1983-1999) 264</b></p><p><b>264.</b>
In the Word references to the conception and bearing of sons are taken in purely a spiritual sense; that is to say, conception stands for the thought and imagination of the heart, and 'sons' for truths. 
This becomes clear from the following in Hosea,  </p>
<blockquote>
As for Ephraim, their glory will fly away like a bird, away from birth, and from the womb, and from conception. Even if they bring up their sons 
I will bereave them so that no human being is left. But woe to them when I shall have departed from them! <a href="http://bible.gospelcom.net/cgi-bin/bible?passage=Hosea%209:11,%2012&amp;version=ESV&amp;interface=print&amp;showfn=yes&amp;showxref">Hosea 9:11, 12</a>.  
</blockquote>
<p>Here 'Ephraim' means those who have intelligence, that is, understanding 
of truth, while 'sons' means truths themselves. A similar reference is made elsewhere in Hosea to Ephraim, that is, a person who has intelligence but has become unwise,  </p>
<blockquote>
The pains of childbirth have 
come upon him, he is an unwise son, for now he will not present himself at the mouth of the womb of sons. <a href="http://bible.gospelcom.net/cgi-bin/bible?passage=Hosea%2013:13&amp;version=ESV&amp;interface=print&amp;showfn=yes&amp;showxref">Hosea 13:13</a>.  
</blockquote>
<p>And in Isaiah,  </p>
<blockquote>
Blush, O Sidon, for the sea has spoken, the stronghold of 
the sea, saying, I have not gone into labour, I have not given birth, nor have I reared young men nor brought up young women. As when the report comes to Egypt, they will go into labour over the report 
of Tyre. <a href="http://bible.gospelcom.net/cgi-bin/bible?passage=Isa%2027:4,%205&amp;version=ESV&amp;interface=print&amp;showfn=yes&amp;showxref">Isa 27:4, 5</a>.   
</blockquote>
Here 'Sidon' stands for people who have possessed cognitions of faith but have destroyed them by means of facts and have consequently become sterile.  </p>
<p></p>
<p><b>[2]</b>
 And in the 
same prophet,  </p>
<blockquote>
Before she went into labour she gave birth, and before pain came to her she brought forth a male child. Who has heard of such a thing as this? Who has seen such? Does a land give birth 
in one day? And shall I [bring to the point of birth and not] cause to give birth? said Jehovah. Shall I who cause to give birth shut up [the womb]? said your God. <a href="http://bible.gospelcom.net/cgi-bin/bible?passage=Isa%2066:7-9&amp;version=ESV&amp;interface=print&amp;showfn=yes&amp;showxref">Isa 66:7-9</a>.  
</blockquote>
<p>This refers to regeneration, 
'sons' in a similar way meaning the truths of faith. Because goods and truths are the conceptions and births of the heavenly marriage, the Lord too calls them 'sons' in Matthew,  </p>
<blockquote>
He who 
sows the good seed is the Son of Man, the field is the world, but the seed are the sons of the kingdom. <a href="http://bible.gospelcom.net/cgi-bin/bible?passage=Matt%2013:37,%2038&amp;version=ESV&amp;interface=print&amp;showfn=yes&amp;showxref">Matt 13:37, 38</a>. 
</blockquote>
<p>And the goods and truths of a saving faith are called 'the sons of Abraham' 
in <a href="http://bible.gospelcom.net/cgi-bin/bible?passage=John%208:39&amp;version=ESV&amp;interface=print&amp;showfn=yes&amp;showxref">John 8:39</a>, for as stated in <a href="255.htm">255</a>, 'seed' means faith. Consequently 'sons', who are the embodiment of the seed, are the goods and truths of faith. This also is why the Lord, being Himself the Seed, 
called Himself the Son of Man, that is, the Church's Faith.  </p>

Quod 'conceptus et partus filiorum' in Verbo nec aliter accipiantur quam in sensu spirituali, nempe 'conceptus' pro cogitatione et figmento cordis, et 'filii' pro veris, constare potest ex his quae 
apud Hosheam, 	Ephraim, sicut avis avolabit gloria eorum, a partu, et ab utero, et a conceptione; etiamsi educaverint filios suos, 	et orbabo eos, ut non sint homo, quin etiam vae iis, quod recessero 
ab iis, ix 11, 12; </p>
<p>ubi 'Ephraim' significat intelligentes, seu intelligentiam veri, et 'filii' ipsa vera. Similiter alibi de Ephraimo seu intelligente, qui factus insipiens, 	Dolores parturientis venerunt 
ei, is filius non sapiens, quia tempore non stabit in fractura matricis filiorum, xiii 13: </p>
<p>et apud Esaiam, 	Erubesce Zidon, quia dixit mare, munimentum maris dicendo, Non parturivi, non peperi, 
nec educavi juvenes, et adolescere feci puellas; sicut cum fama Aegypto, parturient 	secundum famam Tyri, xxiii 4, 5;                                                ubi 'Zidon' pro iis qui in cognitionibus 
fidei fuerunt, et ea per scientifica perdiderunt, ac inde steriles facti: et apud eundem prophetam,  	[2] Antequam parturit, parit, et antequam venit dolor ei, enixa est masculum; quis audivit 
sicut hoc? quis vidit sicut illa? nam parturit terra die uno,... et num [ego frangam, et non] parere faciam? dixit Jehovah; an Ego parere faciens, et occludam? dixit Deus tuus, lxvi 7-9;         
                                              ubi de regeneratione agitur, et per 'filios' similiter vera fidei significantur. Bona et vera fidei sunt conceptus et partus conjugii caelestis, vocantur 
'filii' etiam a Domino apud Matthaeum,            	Qui seminat bonum semen, est Filius Hominis, ager est mundus, semen vero sunt filii regni, xiii 37, 38;                  ac bona et vera fidei salvificae, 
'filii Abraham,' Joh. viii 39; nam 'semen,' ut dictum n. 255, est fides; quare 'filii,' qui sunt seminis, sunt bona et vera fidei: inde etiam Dominus, quia Ipse semen, vocavit Se Filium Hominis, 
hoc est Fidem Ecclesiae.                         </p>
