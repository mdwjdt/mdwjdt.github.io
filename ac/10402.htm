<h4 align="center"></h4><p><strong>10402</strong>.“你们去摘下你们妻子、儿女耳上的金耳环”表从圣言的字义中提取出诸如支持外在的爱和由这些爱所产生的主要观念或原则的那类事物或这些爱的直接后代。这从“摘下”、“耳上的金耳环”、“妻子”、“儿”和“女”的含义清楚可知。“摘下”是指提取出来，在此是指从圣言字义中提取出来，因为这字义是论述的主题。“耳上的金耳环”是对外在的爱之快乐的顺从和辨别的象征性代表，因为“耳”表示顺从和辨别，“金”表示爱之良善，在此表示外在的爱之快乐；因此，“金耳环”是这种顺从和辨别的象征性代表；“耳”表示顺从和辨别（参看<a href="2542.htm">2542</a>，<a href="4652.htm">4652</a>-<a href="4660.htm">4660</a>，<a href="8990.htm">8990</a>，<a href="9397.htm">9397</a>，<a href="10061.htm">10061</a>节），“金”表示爱之良善（<a href="1551.htm">1551</a>，<a href="1552.htm">1552</a>，<a href="5658.htm">5658</a>，<a href="6914.htm">6914</a>，<a href="6917.htm">6917</a>，<a href="9510.htm">9510</a>，<a href="9874.htm">9874</a>，<a href="9881.htm">9881</a>节）；故当论及外在的爱，就是对自我和世界的爱时，“金”表示这些爱的快乐，因而表示邪恶（<a href="8932.htm">8932</a>节）；“耳环”由此而为顺从和辨别的象征性代表（<a href="4551.htm">4551</a>节）。“妻子”是指教会的良善（<a href="3160.htm">3160</a>，<a href="4823.htm">4823</a>，<a href="6014.htm">6014</a>，<a href="7022.htm">7022</a>，<a href="8337.htm">8337</a>节），故在反面意义上是指教会的邪恶（<a href="409.htm">409</a>节）。“儿（子）”是指真理，在反面意义上是指虚假（<a href="489.htm">489</a>，<a href="491.htm">491</a>，<a href="533.htm">533</a>，<a href="1147.htm">1147</a>，<a href="2623.htm">2623</a>，<a href="2803.htm">2803</a>，<a href="2813.htm">2813</a>，<a href="3373.htm">3373</a>，<a href="3704.htm">3704</a>，<a href="4257.htm">4257</a>，<a href="6583.htm">6583</a>，<a href="6584.htm">6584</a>，<a href="9807.htm">9807</a>节）。“女（儿）”是指对真理和良善的情感，因而在反面意义上是指对虚假和邪恶的情感（参看<a href="2362.htm">2362</a>，<a href="3963.htm">3963</a>，<a href="6729.htm">6729</a>节）。由此明显可知，“摘下你们妻子、儿女耳上的金耳环”表示从圣言的字义中提取出诸如被辨别出是顺从或支持外在的爱之快乐或由这些爱所产生的主要观念或原则的那类事物。<br />“耳环”是顺从和辨别的象征，这一点清楚可见于何西阿书：<br />你们要与你们的母亲大大争辩，因为她不是我的妻子，叫她除掉脸上的淫乱，免得我把她剥光，让她赤身露体，使她如旷野，我不怜悯她的儿女。因为她说，我要随从我的爱人，我的饼、水、羊毛、麻都是他们给的。她不知道是我给她五谷、新酒和油，又加增她的银子；他们却用金子制造巴力。我也必使她的葡萄树和无花果树荒废。我必追讨她给诸巴力烧香，佩带耳环和别样妆饰，随从她的爱人，却忘记我的日子。（何西阿书<a href="http://39-27.cn/何2.1.htm">2:1</a>-<a href="http://39-27.cn/何2.13.htm">13</a>）<br />“给诸巴力烧香，佩带耳环”是指将巴力当作神来敬拜，并顺从它们。<br />这一章的前面部分也被引用，好叫人们由此可以看出圣言的外在意义若离了内在意义是什么样，若与内在意义一起又是什么样，从而看出那些只看脱离内在之物的外在陈述的人是如何理解圣言的，而那些从内在之物的视觉来看外在陈述的人又是如何理解圣言的。那些只看脱离内在之物的外在陈述的人若不照着字义来理解，就无法明白这些话。也就是说，他们认为这些话的意思是，如字面所示，他们要与以色列人的母亲争辩；耶和华不再把她当作妻子来爱；她若不除掉自己身上的淫乱，就会被剥光，赤身露体，如旷野一样；耶和华不会怜悯她的儿女，因为她说，她要随从她的爱人，就是那给她饼、水、羊毛和麻的；她不知道是耶和华给她五谷、新酒和油，又加增她的银子；他们却用金子制造巴力；因此，她的葡萄树和无花果树要荒废；必有追讨临到她，因为她给诸巴力烧香，佩带耳环和别样妆饰，随从她的爱人或奸夫，忘记耶和华。<br />这一切都是字义，那些只看脱离内在意义的外在陈述的人就是如此理解圣言的，因为如今的犹太人，以及一些基督徒就是如此理解圣言的。但这并不是圣言的真正含义，凡拥有某种程度的光照之人都能看出这一点。所有这些事物都是指着“母亲”说的，而这些人将“母亲”理解为存在于这个民族当中的那种教会，而非一位母亲。他们认为指着她所说的每一个事物都表示与教会有关的某种事物；因为所有这些事物都是从所说的第一个事物或提出的第一个主题开始按次序进行的。这就是他们如何对待“淫乱”，“爱人”，“儿女”，“饼、水、羊毛、麻、五谷、新酒、油、银、金”，之后的“葡萄树和无花果树”，以及“香”和“耳环”的。<br />至于这些事物的每一个都表示什么，这只能从内义，而非其它源头获知。就内义而言，“母亲”和“妻子”表示教会；“让她赤身露体如旷野”表示让它没有任何爱之良善或信之真理；它将要丧失的信之真理和爱之良善由“儿女”，“饼和水”，“羊毛和麻”，“五谷、新酒、银和金”，最后由“葡萄树和无花果树”来表示。源于顺从取代真理和良善的虚假和邪恶的敬拜本身由“给诸巴力烧香，佩戴耳环和别样妆饰”来表示。“母亲”表示教会（参看<a href="289.htm">289</a>，<a href="2691.htm">2691</a>，<a href="2717.htm">2717</a>，<a href="4257.htm">4257</a>，<a href="5581.htm">5581</a>节）；“妻子”也表示教会（<a href="252.htm">252</a>，<a href="253.htm">253</a>，<a href="409.htm">409</a>，<a href="749.htm">749</a>，<a href="770.htm">770</a>，<a href="7022.htm">7022</a>节）；“她赤身露体”表示被剥夺爱之良善和信之真理（<a href="9960.htm">9960</a>节）；“旷野”表示没有教会的真理和良善的一种状态（<a href="2708.htm">2708</a>，<a href="3900.htm">3900</a>，<a href="4736.htm">4736</a>，<a href="7055.htm">7055</a>节）；“淫乱”表示对真理的歪曲（<a href="2466.htm">2466</a>，<a href="2729.htm">2729</a>，<a href="4865.htm">4865</a>，<a href="8904.htm">8904</a>节），因此“爱人”表示那些歪曲的人；“儿子”表示真理，在反面意义上表示虚假（<a href="489.htm">489</a>，<a href="491.htm">491</a>，<a href="533.htm">533</a>，<a href="1147.htm">1147</a>，<a href="2623.htm">2623</a>，<a href="2803.htm">2803</a>，<a href="2813.htm">2813</a>，<a href="3373.htm">3373</a>，<a href="3704.htm">3704</a>，<a href="4257.htm">4257</a>，<a href="6583.htm">6583</a>，<a href="6584.htm">6584</a>，<a href="9807.htm">9807</a>节）；“饼和水”表示爱之良善和信之真理（<a href="9323.htm">9323</a>节）；“羊毛”表示外在人中的良善（<a href="9470.htm">9470</a>节）；“麻”表示外在人中的真理（<a href="7601.htm">7601</a>，<a href="9959.htm">9959</a>节）；“五谷”表示能从中获得真理的良善（<a href="5295.htm">5295</a>，<a href="5410.htm">5410</a>，<a href="5959.htm">5959</a>节）；“新酒”表示源于良善的真理（<a href="3580.htm">3580</a>节）；“油”表示属天良善（<a href="9780.htm">9780</a>，<a href="10261.htm">10261</a>节）；“银”表示真理，“金”一般表示良善（<a href="1551.htm">1551</a>，<a href="1552.htm">1552</a>，<a href="5658.htm">5658</a>，<a href="6914.htm">6914</a>，<a href="6917.htm">6917</a>，<a href="9881.htm">9881</a>节）；“葡萄树”表示内在的属灵教会（<a href="1069.htm">1069</a>，<a href="6376.htm">6376</a>，<a href="9277.htm">9277</a>节）；“无花果树”表示该教会的外在良善（<a href="217.htm">217</a>，<a href="4231.htm">4231</a>，<a href="5113.htm">5113</a>节）；“烧香”表示敬拜（<a href="10177.htm">10177</a>，<a href="10298.htm">10298</a>节）；“耳环”是顺从的一个象征性代表（<a href="4551.htm">4551</a>节）；因此，“佩戴耳环”表示献上顺从。<br />当理解上面所列出的这一切实体，而不是理解字面上的陈述，或与用来表示它们的人、物一起来理解时，在一个属灵层面上所辨别出来的圣言的性质，因而它里面的灵的性质就变得显而易见了。凡阅读圣言的人都被主保持在这层意义上；但除了那些内层打开的人外，没有人能接纳并领受它。这些人因在自己所拥有的认知或知识范围内接纳它，所以照着他们的理解，也就是以他们的理解力能通过他们所拥有的认知或知识被光照的程度和方式而领受它。除此之外，他们一般也被圣言所发出的神圣深深打动。</p>

Tear off the golden earrings that are in the ears of your women, of your sons, and of your daughters. That this signifies the drawing out from the sense of the letter of the Word of such things as favor 
external loves and the principles thence derived, is evident from the signification of "tearing off," as being to draw out, here from the sense of the letter of the Word, because this is the subject 
treated of; from the signification of "the golden earrings that were in their ears," as being representative tokens of obedience and of the noticing of the delights of external loves; for by the "ears" 
is signified obedience and noticing; by "gold," the good of love, here the delight of external loves, wherefore golden earrings are representative tokens of these loves. (That by the "ears" is signified 
obedience and noticing, see n. 2542, 4652-4660, 8990, 9397, 10061; and that by "gold" is signified the good of love, n. 1551, 1552, 5658, 6914, 6917, 9510, 9874, 9881.) Therefore when it is predicated 
of external loves, which are the loves of self and of the world, by "gold" is signified the delight of these loves, thus evil (n. 8932); and that from this "earrings" are representative tokens 
of obedience and of noticing, see n. 4551. From the signification of "women," as being the goods of the church (n. 3160, 4823, 6014, 7022, 8337), consequently in the opposite sense its evils (n. 409); 
from the signification of "sons," as being truths, and in the opposite sense falsities (n. 489, 491, 533, 1147, 2623, 2803, 2813, 3373, 3704, 4257, 6583, 6584, 9807); and from the signification of 
"daughters," as being the affections of truth and good, and therefore in the opposite sense the affections of falsity and evil (see n. 2362, 3963, 6729). From this it is evident that by, "tear off the 
golden earrings that are in the ears of your women, of your sons, and of your daughters," is signified the drawing out from the literal sense of the Word of such things as are noticed to obey or favor 
the delights of external loves and the principles thence derived. [2] That earrings are tokens of obedience and of noticing is evident in Hosea: </p>
<p>     Strive with your mother, for she is not My wife, 
that she may put away her whoredoms from her faces, lest perchance I strip her naked, and make her as a wilderness, and have no pity on her sons. For she said, I will go after my lovers, that give 
me my bread and my waters, my wool and my flax. For she had not known that I gave her the grain, and the new wine, and the oil, and multiplied unto her the silver; and the gold they made into a baal. 
And I will lay waste her vine and her fig-tree; and I will visit upon her the days of the baals to which she burned incense, and put on her earring and her adornment, and went after her lovers, and forgot 
Me (Hos. 2:1-13); </p>
<p>"to burn incense, and to put on an earring to the baals," denotes to worship the baal gods and to obey them.  [3] The things that precede in this chapter have also been adduced 
to the end that it may thereby be known what is the nature of the external sense of the Word without the internal, and what it is together with the internal, thus in what manner those perceive the Word 
who are in externals without an internal, and in what manner those perceive it who are in externals from an internal. Those who are in externals separate from what is internal cannot apprehend these 
words otherwise than according to the letter, which is, that they should strive with the mother of the sons of Israel, that she was no longer loved by Jehovah as a wife, and that if she put not away 
her whoredoms from her she would be stripped naked and be made as a wilderness, and Jehovah would have no pity on her sons, because she said that she would go after her lovers who give her bread and 
water, wool and flax, and that she knew not that Jehovah gave her grain, wine, and oil, and multiplied her silver, that they made gold into a baal; and that on this account her vine was laid waste and 
her fig-tree, and that it will be visited upon her because she burned incense to the baals, and put on her earring and adornment, and went after her lovers or adulterers, forgetting Jehovah. [4] This 
is the sense of the letter, and so is the Word understood by those who are in externals without what is internal, for so it is understood by the Jews at this day, and also by some Christians. But that 
this is not the sense of the Word can be seen by all those who are in some enlightenment. When these persons, by the "mother" of whom all those things are said, do not understand a mother, but the 
church, such as it was with that nation, they then comprehend that something of the church is signified by all the particulars which are said of her (for these are such as follow in order from the first 
thing said, or from the first subject); as by "whoredoms," by "lovers," by "sons," and by "bread," "water," "wool," "flax," "grain," "new wine," "oil," "silver," "gold," and by "vine and fig-tree," 
and likewise by "incense" and by "earring."  [5] What each of these things signifies cannot be known from any other source than the internal sense, in which by "mother" and "wife" is signified the 
church; by "making her naked, and as a wilderness," is signified to be without the goods of love and the truths of faith. The truths of faith and the goods of love, of which she shall be bereaved, are 
signified by "sons," by "bread and water," by "wool and flax," by "grain," "new wine," "oil," "silver," "gold," and finally by "vine and fig-tree." The worship itself from obedience to falsities and 
evils, which succeed in the place of truths and goods, is signified by "burning incense and putting on her earring and adornment for the baals." (That "mother" denotes the church, see n. 289, 2691, 2717, 
4257, 5581; also a "wife," n. 252, 253, 409, 749, 770, 7022; that "to be made naked" denotes to be deprived of the goods of love and the truths of faith, n. 9960; that a "wilderness" denotes a state 
devoid of the truth and good of the church, n. 2708, 3900, 4736, 7055; that "whoredoms" denote falsifications of truth, n. 2466, 2729, 4865, 8904, consequently "lovers" denote those who falsify; that 
"sons" denote truths and in the opposite sense falsities, n. 489, 491, 533, 1147, 2623, 2803, 2813, 3373, 3704, 4257, 6583, 6584, 9807; that "bread and water" denote the good of love and the truth 
of faith, n. 9323; that "wool" denotes good in the external man, n. 9470; "flax" truth therein, n. 7601, 9959; "grain" the good from which is truth, n. 5295, 5410, 5959; "new wine" the truth thence derived, 
n. 3580; and "oil" celestial good, n. 9780, 10261; that "silver" denotes truth, and "gold" good in general, n. 1551, 1552, 5658, 6914, 6917, 9881; that a "vine" denotes the internal spiritual church, 
n. 1069, 6376, 9277; and a "fig-tree" the external good of this church, n. 217, 4231, 5113; that "to burn incense" denotes worship, n. 10177, 10298; and that an "earring" is a representative token 
of obedience, n. 4551; consequently "to put it on" denotes to obey.)  [6] When these things are understood instead of the literal statements, or together with them, it is then apparent what is the 
nature of the Word when it is spiritually perceived, thus what its nature is in respect to its spirit. In this sense all who read the Word are kept by the Lord, but it is not received by any except 
those with whom the interiors have been opened; and as it is received in knowledges, therefore it is received according to their understanding, in the degree and in the manner that this can be enlightened 
by means of the knowledges they have. Besides this, they are affected in a general way with the holy influence that comes from the Word. </p>

'Pull away the ear-jewels of gold from the ears of your wives, of your sons, and of your daughters' means drawing out of the literal sense of the Word such things as are favourable to external forms 
of love and to the immediate offspring of these loves. This is clear from the meaning of 'pulling away' as drawing out, at this point out of the literal sense of the Word since that sense is the subject; 
from the meaning of 'the ear-jewels of gold which are on the ears' as symbols representative of obedience to the delights belonging to external kinds of love and discernment of them, for obedience 
and discernment are meant by 'the ears', and the good of love - at this point the delight belonging to external kinds of love - is meant by 'gold', so that 'the ear-jewels of gold' are symbols representative 
of that obedience and discernment (for the meaning of 'the ears' as obedience and discernment, see <a href="2542.htm">2542</a>, <a href="4652.htm">4652</a>-<a href="4660.htm">4660</a>, <a href="8990.htm">8990</a>, <a href="9397.htm">9397</a>, <a href="10061.htm">10061</a>; for that of 'gold' as the good of love, <a href="1551.htm">1551</a>, <a href="1552.htm">1552</a>, <a href="5658.htm">5658</a>, <a href="6914.htm">6914</a>, <a href="6917.htm">6917</a>, <a href="9510.htm">9510</a>, <a href="9874.htm">9874</a>, <a href="9881.htm">9881</a>, so that when it has reference to external kinds of love, which are self-love and love of the world, 'gold' means the delight belonging to them, thus that which is evil,

the Word such things as are discerned to be obedient or favourable to the delights belonging to external forms of love and favourable to the major ideas resulting from these.  </p>

 The fact that 'ear-jewels' 
are symbols of obedience and discernment is clear in Hosea,  </p>

 Earlier parts of that chapter have also been quoted 
to allow it to be seen what the outward sense of the Word is like without the inward, and what it is like together with the inward, and so how the Word is understood by those who see its outward statements 
in isolation from what is inward, and how it is understood by those who see the outward statements from the point of view of that which is inward. Those who see the outward statements in isolation 
from what is inward inevitably take them literally. That is, they take them to mean that they should literally contend with the mother of the children of Israel; that she was literally no longer loved 
by Jehovah as a wife; that if she did not remove the whoredoms from herself she would literally be stripped naked and made like a wilderness, and Jehovah would not have mercy on her children, since 
she had said that she was going to go after her lovers who gave her bread, water, wool, and linen; that she did not know it was Jehovah who gave her the grain, the new wine, and the oil, and multiplied 
the silver; that they made the gold for baal; that for this reason her vine and her fig tree would be laid waste; and that there would literally be a visitation on her because she burned incense to 
the baals, decked herself with ear-jewels and other jewellery for them, and went after her adulterous lovers, forgetful of  Jehovah.  </p>
<p></p>
<p><b>[4]</b>
 All this is the literal meaning, and so it is how those 
who see the outward statements in isolation from their inward meaning understand the Word, for it is how the Jews at the present day and also some Christians understand it. But that is not the real meaning 
of the Word, as all who have any degree of enlightenment may see. By 'mother', regarding whom all those things are stated, they do not understand a mother but the kind of Church that existed among 
that nation. They take each of the things stated regarding her to mean something that has to do with the Church; for all those things are such as follow in order from what is put forward or laid down 
first. That is how they take 'whoredoms', 'lovers', and 'children' or 'sons', then 'bread, water, wool, linen, grain, new wine, oil, silver, gold', after that 'vine and fig', and also 'incense' and 
'ear-jewels'. </p>
<p><b>[5]</b>
 What each of these serves to mean can be known from no other source than the internal sense. In this sense 'mother' and 'wife' mean the Church; 'making her naked, and like a wilderness' 
means leaving it without any good of love or truth of faith, truths of faith and forms of the good of love, of which it will be bereft, being meant by 'sons', 'bread and water', 'wool and linen', 
'grain, new wine, oil, silver, and gold', and finally 'vine and fig'. The actual worship springing from obedience to falsities and evils, which take over for truths and forms of good, is meant by 'burning 
incense to the baals and being decked out with ear-jewels and other jewellery for them'.  </p>

 When all the entities 
listed immediately above are understood instead of or in conjunction with the people or things that serve to mean them, the nature of the Word discerned on a spiritual level, thus the nature of the 
spirit within it, becomes apparent. All who read the Word are sustained by the Lord on that level of meaning; but none receive and accept it apart from those whose interiors are open. And since these 
receive it within the cognitions or knowledge they possess, they accept it so far as they can understand it, that is, in the measure and manner that their power of understanding can be enlightened through 
the cognitions or knowledge in their possession. In addition to this, they are affected in a general way by the holiness that  radiates from the Word.

vestrorum, et filiarum vestrarum' significetur extractio ex sensu litterae Verbi talium quae appercipiuntur oboedire seu favere jucundis amorum externorum, {2} ac principiis inde. Quod `inaures' 
sint insignia oboedientiae et apperceptionis, constat apud Hoscheam, [2] 	Contendite cum matre vestra, quoniam illa non uxor Mea, ut removeat scortationes suas a faciebus suis, ne forte exuam eam nudam, 
et ponam eam sicut desertum, et filiorum ejus non miserear; (m)quia dixit, Ibo post amasios meos, dantes panem meum et aquas meas, lanam meam et linum meum;(n) et illa non noverat quod Ego dedissem

<p>`suffimenta adolere, ac induere inaurem balibus' est colere deos baales, ac oboedire illis; illa quae 
praecedunt in illo capite etiam allata sunt ob [3] finem ut inde sciatur qualis est sensus Verbi externus absque interno, et qualis est simul cum interno; ita qualiter percipiunt Verbum illi qui in externis 
sunt absque interno, et qualiter qui (d)in externis sunt ex interno; qui in externis sunt {3}separatis ab interno, non aliter capere possunt illa quam secundum litteram, quae est quod contenderent 
cum matre filiorum Israelis, quod non amplius {4}amaretur a Jehovah sicut uxor; et si non removeat scortationes a se, quod exueretur nuda et poneretur sicut desertum; et ne Jehovah {5} misereretur 
filiorum ejus, quia dixit quod iret post amasios suos, qui {6}dant ei panem, {7} aquas, lanam et linum; et quod illa non nosset quod Jehovah dederit ei frumentum, {7} mustum, et oleum, et multiplicaverit 
argentum; {8}quod fecerint aurum baali; et quod ideo devastaretur vitis ejus (c)ac ficus ejus, (c)et quod super illa visitabitur, quia baalibus suffimenta adoluit, (c)ac eis induit inaurem et ornatum, 
ivitque post amasios seu adulteros oblita [4] Jehovae; hic est sensus litterae, (c)ac ita intelligitur Verbum ab illis qui in externis {9}sunt absque interno, ita namque a Judaeis hodie, et quoque 
a quibusdam Christianis; sed quod ille sensus Verbi non sit, videre possunt omnes illi qui in quadam illustratione sunt; hi cum per `matrem,' de qua omnia illa dicuntur, non intelligunt matrem, sed 
Ecclesiam, qualis erat apud gentem illam, tunc comprehendunt quod aliquid Ecclesiae {10}significetur per singula quae de illa dicuntur, nam sunt talia quae sequuntur ordine a prima positione seu a primo 
subjecto; sicut per `scortationes,' {7} per `amasios,' per `filios,' perque `panem {11}aquas, lanam, linum, frumentum, mustum, oleum, argentum, aurum, [5] perque `vitem et ficum,' et quoque per `suffimenta' 
et per `inaurem'; quid singula illa significant, non aliunde sciri potest quam ex sensu interno, in quo per `matrem' et `uxorem' significatur Ecclesia, per `ponere illam nudam, et sicut desertum' 
significatur absque bonis amoris et veris fidei; vera fidei et bona amoris, quibus orbabitur, significantur per `filios,' per `panem et aquas,' per `lanam et linum,' per `frumentum, mustum, oleum, 
{12} argentum, {7} aurum,' et denique per `vitem et ficum'; ipse cultus ex oboedientia falsorum et malorum, quae loco verorum et bonorum {13}succedent, (x)significatur per `suffimenta adolere, et
