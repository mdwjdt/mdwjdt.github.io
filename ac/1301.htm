<h4 align="center"></h4><p><strong>1301.</strong>从本节提及的所有这些事物的含义，以及此处提及的他们所用石头和灰泥之类的材料，谁都能清楚看出所表示的是这些事物。事物若不包含这些奥秘在里头，在主的圣言中绝不值得一提。</p>

<p><strong>[NCE]1301.</strong> Anyone can see that this, now, is what is being symbolized. The clues are provided both by the symbolism of all the individual elements of the verse and by the nature of the details mentioned, such as the type of stones and the type of mortar they were using. Such details would never be worthy of mention in the Lord's Word if they did not enfold such hidden meanings as these. </p>
<p align="center"><b>Potts(1905-1910) 1301</b></p><p><b>1301.</b>
That these things are signified may now be seen by anyone, both from the signification of all the things mentioned in this verse, and from such things being here mentioned as the kind of stones and of 
mortar that they used; things by no means worthy to be mentioned in the Word of the Lord, unless these arcana were contained within them. </p>

<p align="center"><b>Elliott(1983-1999) 1301</b></p><p><b>1301.</b>
The fact that these things are meant may now become clear to anyone both from the meaning of everything which this verse contains and also from the fact that the kinds of stones and the kind of clay 
they had are mentioned. These points would not have been worth mentioning in the Word of the Lord if they had not embodied those arcana. </p>

<p align="center"><b>Latin(1748-1756) 1301</b>
</p><b>1301.</b>
Quod nunc haec significentur, cuivis constare potest, tam ex significatione omnium horum quae in hoc versu, quam ex eo quod hic memorentur talia sicut quales eorum lapides essent, quale eorum lutum, 
quae nusquam digna forent in Verbo Domini memorare nisi arcana haec involverentur. </p>
