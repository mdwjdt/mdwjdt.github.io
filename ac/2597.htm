<h3 align="center" class="ired">属天的奥秘 第2597节</h3>
<h4 align="center"></h4><p><strong>2597.</strong>一些外邦人在世时从与他人的交往，以及道听途说逐渐了解到，基督徒过着极其邪恶的生活，包括奸淫、仇恨、争吵、酗酒，等等，这让他们震惊不已，因为这些恶行违背他们的法律、习俗和宗教信仰。所以在来世，比起其他人，这些人对是否接受信的真理更犹豫不决。天使告诉他们，基督教的教义和信仰本身所教导的事与这类恶行完全相反，基督徒遵行其教义的程度还不如外邦人。当了解了这一点后，他们欣然接受信的真理，敬拜主，不过，这个过程要比其他人慢一些。</p>

<p align="center"><b>Potts(1905-1910) 2597</b></p><p><b>2597.</b>
There are Gentiles who when they lived in the world had known from social interaction and report that Christians lead the very worst life-in adulteries, in hatreds and quarrels, in drunkenness, and the 
like things-at which they are affected with horror, because such things are contrary to their laws, their morals, and their religion. In the other life these are more timid than others in receiving 
the truths of faith; but they are instructed by the angels that the Christian doctrine, and the faith itself, teach the very opposite, but that Christians live less in accordance with their doctrine 
than do the Gentiles. When they perceive this they receive the truths of faith and adore the Lord, but more tardily. </p>

<p align="center"><b>Elliott(1983-1999) 2597</b></p><p><b>2597.</b>
There are gentiles who when they lived in the world came to know from their associations with others and from what was reported to them that Christians lead very wicked lives, involving acts of adultery, 
hatred and quarreling, drunkenness, and other similarly wicked ways, which horrified them since such actions are contrary to their laws, customs, and religion. In the next life these are more apprehensive 
than others about receiving the truths of faith. But they are informed by the angels that Christian teaching, and the Christian faith itself, teach something completely different from such behaviour, 
and that Christians live up to that which their doctrine teaches less than gentiles. On learning this they then receive the truths of faith and adore the Lord, but more slowly than others. </p>

</p><b>2597.</b>
Sunt gentiles qui cum vixerunt in mundo, ex conversatione et fama cognoverunt quod Christiani pessimam vitam agant, in adulteriis, in odiis et rixis, in ebrietate, et similibus, quae illi horruerunt, 
quia talia contra eorum leges, mores, et religiosa; illi in altera vita aliis timidiores sunt recipiendi vera fidei; sed instruuntur ab angelis quod doctrina Christiana, ac ipsa fides prorsus aliud 
doceat, et quod illi minus quam gentiles secundum doctrinalia vivant; quae cum appercipiunt, vera fidei recipiunt, et Dominum adorant, sed serius. </p>
