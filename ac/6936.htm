<h3 align="center" class="ired">属天的奥秘 第6936节</h3>
<h4 align="center"></h4><p><strong>6936.</strong>下面这个例子会使这个问题的真相显得更清楚。每个人都要照顾好自己的身体，给它提供适当的衣食。他必须首先做到这一点，然而目的是为了有一个在一个健康身体中的健康心智。每个人都要照顾好自己的心智，给它提供适当的食物，也就是诸如属聪明智慧的那类事物，目的是为了他的心智能因此有条件事奉主。凡这样做的人就是在永远善待自己。但是，凡仅仅为了身体而照顾自己的身体，或不以诸如属聪明智慧的那类事物，反以诸如与之相反的那类事物喂养自己心智的人，就是在永远恶待自己。由此可见每个人当以哪种方式成为自己的邻舍，即这邻舍不是第一位的，而是最后一位的；因为目的不是为了自己，而是为了他人。一个人的目的在哪里，对他来说最重要的东西就在哪里。</p>

How the case herein is can be further seen from this similar example. Everyone ought to take care of his body in respect to its food and clothing. This must come first, but to the end that there may 
be a sound mind in a sound body. And everyone ought to take care of his mind in respect to its food, namely, in respect to such things as belong to intelligence and wisdom, to the end that his mind may 
thus be in a state to serve the Lord; he who does this, takes good care of himself for eternity. But he who takes care of his body merely for the sake of the body, and does not think of soundness of 
mind, and who does not take care of his mind in respect to such things as are of intelligence and wisdom, but in respect to such things as are contrary thereto, takes bad care of himself for eternity. 
From all this it is evident in what way everyone ought to be neighbor to himself, namely, not in the first place but in the last; for the end must not be for himself, but for others; and where the end 
is, there is the first. </p>

<p align="center"><b>Elliott(1983-1999) 6936</b></p><p><b>6936.</b>
The truth of this matter is made still clearer by the following similar consideration. Everyone ought to ensure that his body is properly fed and clothed. He must do this first, yet to the end that there 
may be a healthy mind in a healthy body. And everyone ought to make sure that his mind is properly fed, that is to say, with such things as are matters of intelligence and wisdom, to the end that 
it may therefore be in a condition to serve the Lord. The person who does this looks after himself well for evermore. But anyone who looks after his body solely for its own sake, giving no thought to 
healthiness of mind, or anyone who feeds his mind not with such things as are matters of intelligence and wisdom but with such things as are the opposite of them, looks after himself badly for evermore. 
From all this one may see that though everyone ought to be a neighbour to himself, this is not of the first but of the last and lowest importance, for the end in view should not be self but others. 
Where a person's end in view lies, there lies what is of first importance to him. </p>

</p><b>6936.</b>
Quomodo cum hoc se habet, constare ulterius potest ab hoc simili: quisque consulere debet corpori suo victu et amictu, hoc primum erit sed ob finem ut mens sana sit in corpore sano; et quisque consulere 
debet menti (x)suae victu, nempe talibus quae sunt intelligentiae et sapientiae, ob finem ut illa inde in statu sit serviendi Domino; qui hoc facit sibi consulit bene in aeternum.  Qui autem consulit 
corpori suo solum pro corpore, nec cogitat de sanitate mentis, et qui consulit menti suae non talibus quae sunt intelligentiae et sapientiae, sed talibus quae contra illa {1}sunt, is consulit sibi 
male in aeternum.  Ex his patet quomodo quisque sibi proximus esse debet, quod nempe non primo loco sed ultimo; finis enim non erit pro se sed pro aliis; et ubi finis, ibi primum. 	@1 Before contra$ </p>
