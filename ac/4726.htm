<h3 align="center" class="ired">属天的奥秘 第4726节</h3>
<h4 align="center"></h4><p><strong>4726.</strong>“看哪！这做梦的主来了”表那些空洞无用的观念。这从“梦”的含义清楚可知，“梦”是指宣告（<a href="4682.htm">4682</a>节），在此是指神性真理的宣告，因为此处这些话论及约瑟。但由于就其本质而言，神性真理被那些坚持唯信的人弃绝，如论及主的神性人身和仁爱之处所说明的，所以“梦”在此表示空洞无用的观念。因为这种人视虚假为真理，视真理为虚假，即便不视之为虚假，也视之为空洞无用的观念；“做梦的主”就是宣告这类观念的人。<br />许多事表明，神性真理被这种人视为空洞无用的观念。例如，有一个神性真理是这样，圣言是神圣和神性的，一点一划都被启示的；其神圣和神性启示是由于以下事实：它里面的一切事物都是主国度的属天和属灵事物的代表和符号。但当圣言的内义被打开，表明每个细节都代表并表示什么的教导被提供时，执守唯信的信徒却将这些事当作空洞无用的观念而加以弃绝，声称它们没有任何用处；而事实上，它们都是属天和属灵事物，这些事物带给内在人的快乐，远远超过世俗事物带给外在人的快乐。其它许多神性真理也是如此。</p>

Behold this lord of dreams cometh. That this signifies that those things were empty, is evident from the signification of "dreams," as being preachings (n. 4682), here preachings of Divine truth, because 
it is said of Joseph. But because Divine truth as to its essentials is rejected by those who are in faith alone (as was shown in regard to the Lord's Divine Human and charity), therefore by "dreams" 
are here signified empty things; for to such persons falsities appear as truths, and truths as falsities, or if not as falsities, yet as empty things; and the "lord of dreams" is the preacher of these. 
That Divine truths appear to such persons as empty, is evident from many things-as for example, it is a Divine truth that the Word is holy and Divinely inspired as to every jot, and that its holiness 
and Divine inspiration are in consequence of everything in it being representative and significative of heavenly and spiritual things of the Lord's kingdom. But when the Word is open to the internal 
sense, and it is taught what its particulars represent and signify, then such as are in faith alone reject these things as empty, saying that they are of no use; although these heavenly and spiritual 
things are what would affect the internal man with greater delight than worldly things affect the external man; and so in many other instances. </p>

<p align="center"><b>Elliott(1983-1999) 4726</b></p><p><b>4726.</b>
'Behold, that dreamer is coming' means those futile ideas. This is clear from the meaning of 'dreams' as declarations, dealt with in <a href="4682.htm">4682</a>, in this case declarations of Divine Truth since the words used 
here have reference to Joseph. But because Divine Truth - that is, its essential teachings - is rejected by those who adhere to faith alone, as shown above where the Lord's Divine Human and charity 
are spoken of, 'dreams' in this case therefore means futile ideas. For people of this kind see falsities as truths, and truths as falsities, or if not as falsities then as futile ideas; and 'a dreamer' 
is one who declares such ideas. </p>
<p></p>
<p><b>[2]</b>
 Many things reveal that Divine Truths are seen by such people as futile ideas. For example, one Divine Truth is that the Word is holy and divinely inspired even 
to every tiny letter, and that its holiness and Divine inspiration are due to the fact that everything in it serves as a representative and as a sign meaning celestial and spiritual things in the Lord's 
kingdom. But when the internal sense of the Word is laid open and teaching is provided to show what each detail represents and means, such adherents to faith alone reject those things as futile 
ideas, saying that they have no use, when in fact they are celestial and spiritual matters that would bring more delight to the internal man than worldly ones do to the external man. The same is so with 
many other Divine Truths. </p>

`Ecce dominus somniorum iste venit': quod significet quod vana illa, constat ex significatione `somniorum' quod sint praedicationes, de qua n. 4682, hic praedicationes Divini Veri quia de `Josepho' 
dicitur; sed quia Divinum Verum ab illis qui in sola fide (o)sunt, quoad essentialia sua rejicitur, sicut ostensum [supra] de Divino Humano Domini et de charitate, ideo per `somnia' hic significantur 
vana; apparent enim talibus falsa ut vera, ac vera ut falsa, et si non ut falsa, usque ut vana; `dominus somniorum' est praedicator eorum.  [2] Quod Divina Vera appareant talibus ut vana, a pluribus 
constare potest; sicut pro exemplo: </p>
<p>Divinum Verum est quod Verbum sit sanctum, et quoad unamquamvis iotam divinitus inspiratum, et quod sanctitas ejus (c)et Divina inspiratio sit, quia unumquodvis 
ibi est repraesentativum et significativum caelestium et spiritualium regni Domini; cum autem aperitur Verbum quoad sensum internum et docetur quid singula repraesentant et significant, tunc 
tales qui in sola fide sunt, rejiciunt inter vana, dicendo quod non alicujus usus sint, tametsi ipsa `caelestia et spiritualia' sunt quae (t)amoene afficerent internum hominem, plus quam mundana 
externum; similiter in multis aliis. </p>
