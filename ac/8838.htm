<h3 align="center" class="ired">属天的奥秘 第8838节</h3>
<h4 align="center"></h4><p><strong>8838.</strong>“叫山分别为圣”表他们由此可以远离神性。这从“分别为圣”的含义清楚可知，“分别为圣”是指遮盖内层，好叫外在能出现在神圣中（参看<a href="8788.htm">8788</a>，<a href="8806.htm">8806</a>节），因而也指远离神性，免得他们受到伤害。除非他们被遮盖起来，否则神性就会刺透并毁灭他们。因为神性的同在对那些没有被遮盖的人来说，就像一团吞灭的火。这也解释了为何天使被云遮盖（<a href="6849.htm">6849</a>节）。由此可见当如何理解“被遮盖起来”。</p>

And sanctify it [the people]. That this signifies that thus they may be kept off from the Divine, is evident from the signification of "sanctifying," as being to veil over the interiors that the externals 
may appear in holiness (see n. 8788, 8806), thus also to be kept off from the Divine lest they should be hurt. For unless they were veiled over, the Divine would penetrate and destroy, because the 
presence of the Divine is like a consuming fire to those who are not veiled over. Hence it is that even the angels are veiled over with a cloud (n. 6849). From all this it can be seen what is meant 
by being veiled over. That this is signified by "being sanctified" is because when they are veiled over they appear in holiness, for then the Divine can flow in and present there a state of good and 
a form of truth, which cannot be effected without a veiling over. </p>

'And sanctify it' means that they are thereby held back from the Divine. This is clear from the meaning of 'sanctifying' as covering over their interiors in order that externals may appear in holiness, 
dealt with in <a href="8788.htm">8788</a>, <a href="8806.htm">8806</a>, thus also being held back from the Divine so as not to suffer harm. Unless they were covered over the Divine would penetrate them and destroy them. For the presence of the 
Divine is like a devouring fire to those who have not been covered. This also explains why angels are covered with a cloud, <a href="6849.htm">6849</a>. From all this one may see what should be understood by being covered 
over. The reason why this is meant by 'being sanctified' is that those who are covered appear in holiness, for then the Divine can flow in, establishing a state of good and giving it the form of truth, 
which cannot happen without the covering-over. </p>

`Et sanctifica eum': quod significet quod sic ex Divino arceantur, constat ex significatione `sanctificare' quod sit obvelare interiora ut externa in sancto appareant, de qua n. 8788, 8806, {1}ita quoque 
arceri a Divino ne laedantur, nam nisi obvelarentur, penetraret Divinum et destrueret; praesentia enim Divini est sicut ignis consumens illis qui non obvelati sunt; inde est quod etiam angeli obvelentur 
nube, n. 6849; ex his constare potest quid intelligitur per obvelari; quod hoc significetur per `sanctificari,' est quia cum obvelati {2}apparent in sancto, nam tunc (t)potest Divinum influere 
et sistere ibi statum boni et formam veri, quod absque obvelatione non fieri potest. @1 inde$  @2 appareant$  </p>
