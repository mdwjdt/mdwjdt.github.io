<h4 align="center"></h4><p><h4 align="center">木星的灵人和居民（续）</h4><br />8242.我还被指示木星居民的脸是什么样子。倒不是说我看见了木星居民本身，而是只看见了灵人，他们的脸和他们活在自己星球上时所拥有的脸很相似。不过，在我在指示他们的脸是什么样子之前，他们天使中的一位出现在一片亮云后面。他给予准许，然后就有两张脸被指给我看。它们类似于我们地球人的脸，白皙，然而漂亮，还散发出诚实和真正的谦逊。</p>

CONTINUATION ABOUT THE SPIRITS AND THE INHABITANTS OF THE EARTH JUPITER. I have also been shown what kind of faces the inhabitants of the earth Jupiter have; not that I have seen the inhabitants themselves, 
but that the spirits were seen with faces like those which they had while on their earth. But before this was shown, one of their angels appeared behind a bright cloud, who gave leave, and then 
two faces were shown. They were like the faces of the men of our earth, fair, but more beautiful; sincerity and modesty shone forth from them. </p>

SPIRITS AND INHABITANTS OF THE PLANET JUPITER - continued </p>
<p>I have also been shown what the face of an inhabitant of the planet Jupiter looks like. Not that I have seen actual inhabitants, only spirits, 
whose faces are similar to the ones they had when they lived on their planet. But before I was shown what their faces look like one of their angels appeared behind a bright cloud. He gave permission, 
and then two faces were shown to me. They were like the faces of people belonging to our planet, white yet more beautiful, with sincerity and true humility radiating from them. </p>

Continuatio de Spiritibus et Incolis Telluris Jovis </p>
<p>Quali facie sunt incolae telluris jovis, etiam mihi ostensum est, non quod ipsi incolae mihi visi sint, sed quod spiritus in simili facie in qua 
fuerunt cum in sua tellure; sed antequam id ostensum est, apparebat unus ex angelis (c)illorum post nubem candidam, qui dabat veniam; et tunc binae facies ostensae sunt; erant sicut facies hominum nostrae 
telluris, candidae sed pulchriores; eluxit ex illis sincerum et modestum. </p>
