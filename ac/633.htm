<h3 align="center" class="ired">属天的奥秘 第633节</h3>
<h4 align="center"></h4><p><strong>633.</strong>情况乃是这样：人皆有对真理的觉知和对良善的意愿，甚至那些不属上古教会之人亦有。然而，当人变得属天时，他们看似拥有一个对良善的意愿和一个对真理的觉知。而实际上，它唯独属于主，他们和天使一样，还知道、承认并觉察这一事实。真相是，凡不知道、承认和觉察这一事实者，既没有对真理的觉知，也没有对任何良善的意愿。对每个人、每位天使，甚至最为属天的天使而言，他的自我中心无非是假与恶，因为众所周知，在主眼前天也不洁净（约伯记<a href="http://39-27.cn/伯15.15.htm">15:15</a>），一切善与一切真唯独是主的。不过，任何人或天使越能被完善，就越能蒙主的神圣恩典而得以完善，可以说就越接受对真理的觉知和对良善的意愿。然而，他拥有这些只是表象。每个人都能被完善，因而能接受主的恩赐，既照着他的实际生活行为，也以一种与遗传自父母并根植在他里面的邪恶相一致的方式。</p>

<p><strong>[NCE]633.</strong> The fact of the matter is that no one has any understanding of truth or will to do good. Not even the people of the earliest church had them. When people develop a heavenly nature, they seem to have a will to do good and an understanding of truth, but the capability is all the Lord's, as they themselves see, acknowledge, and perceive. The same holds true for angels. So entirely is this the case that anyone who fails to see, acknowledge, and perceive the truth of it utterly lacks any comprehension of truth or will to do good.<br />The independent self of every human being and every angel — even the most heavenly — is mere falsity and evil. As people know, the heavens are not pure in the Lord's sight [<a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_633/bible_king-james-version_job_15_15" target=_top>Job 15:15</a>], and all good and all truth belong to him alone.<br />If a person or an angel can be perfected, then by the Lord's divine mercy that individual is perfected and receives what seems to be an understanding of truth and a will to do good. But what she or he has is only an apparent possession.<br />All people can be perfected and so receive this gift of the Lord's mercy. The way they have lived their lives, in view of the evil they have inherited from their parents, determines the shape in which mercy comes to them. </p>
<p align="center"><b>Potts(1905-1910) 633</b></p><p><b>633.</b>
The case is this: With no man is there any understanding of truth and will of good, not even with those who were of the Most Ancient Church. But when men become celestial it appears as if they had a 
will of good and understanding of truth, and yet this is of the Lord alone, as they also know, acknowledge, and perceive. So is it with the angels also. So true is this that whoever does not know, acknowledge, 
and perceive that it is so, has no understanding of truth or will of good whatever. With every man, and with every angel, even the most celestial, that which is his own is nothing but falsity 
and evil; for it is known that the heavens are not clean before the Lord [Job 15:15], and that all good and all truth are of the Lord alone. But so far as a man or an angel is capable of being perfected, 
so far of the Lord's Divine mercy he is perfected, and receives as it were an understanding of truth and a will of good; but his having these is only an appearance. Every man can be perfected-and 
consequently receive this gift of the Lord's mercy-in accordance with the actual doings of his life, and in a manner suited to the hereditary evil implanted by his parents. </p>

<p align="center"><b>Elliott(1983-1999) 633</b></p><p><b>633.</b>
The situation is this: No understanding of truth or will for good resides with anyone, not even with those who belonged to the Most Ancient Church. When people become celestial however, they do seem 
to have a will for good and an understanding of truth residing with them. </p>
But in reality it is the Lord's alone, a fact they also know, acknowledge, and perceive, as is the case also with angels. This 
is so true that a person who does not know, acknowledge, and perceive it has no understanding of truth and will for good whatever. With every man, and with every angel, even the most celestial, his 
proprium is nothing but falsity and evil, for it is well known that in the Lord's eyes even the heavens are not pure,<A name="fntext1"></a><A href="#fn1"><sup>a</sup></a> and that all good and all truth are the Lord's alone. But to the extent that any 
man or angel is capable of being perfected, he is in the Lord's Divine mercy perfected, and receives so to speak an understanding of truth and a will for good. His own possession of them however is 
only the appearance. Everybody is capable of being perfected, and consequently of receiving this gift of the Lord's mercy, in so far as the deeds he actually performs in life will allow, and in a manner 
consistent with the hereditary evil implanted within him from parents.

</p><b>633.</b>
Res se ita habet quod apud nullum hominem sit aliquis intellectus veri ac voluntas boni, ne quidem apud illos qui fuerunt ex Antiquissima Ecclesia; sed cum caelestes fiunt, apparet sicut voluntas boni 
et intellectus veri esset apud eos, sed est solius Domini, quod etiam sciunt, agnoscunt et percipiunt; sicut etiam apud angelos; usque adeo ut qui non scit, agnoscit et percipit quod ita sit, nihil 
prorsus intellectus veri et voluntatis boni habeat. Apud hominem quemcumque, et apud angelum quemcumque, etiamsi caelestissimum, proprium ejus non est nisi falsum et malum; nam notum est quod caeli non 
sint puri coram Domino; et quod omne bonum et omne verum sit solius Domini; sed sicut homo et angelus potest perfici, ita, ex Divina Domini Misericordia, perficitur, et recipit sicut intellectam veri 
et voluntatem boni, sed quod habeat, est solum apparentia: perfici potest unusquisque homo, et consequenter recipere donum hoc misericordiae Domini, secundum cujusvis vitae actualitates {x}convenienter 
ejus implantato a parentibus malo hereditario. </p>
