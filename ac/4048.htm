<h3 align="center" class="ired">属天的奥秘 第4048节</h3>
<h4 align="center"></h4><p><strong>4048.</strong>有一个灵人贴近我的脑袋，我从声音感觉他处于像是安睡的那种宁静状态。他问这问那，但非常谨慎，以致哪怕醒着的人都不可能表现出这么大的谨慎。我发现有内层天使通过他说话，他处于能意识到并再现他们所说之话的状态。我对这种状态作一番调查，然后告诉他我所觉察到的这种状态的性质。他回答说，除了良善与真理外，他什么也不说；他也会留意有没有别的东西流入，若有别的东西流入，他不会准许进来，或说它。提到他的状态，他说，这种状态很平和，如我通过与它相交所得以觉察到的。我被告知，那些与脑中的窦道或主血管相关联的灵人就具有这种性质；像他那样的灵人就与矢状窦相关联，矢状窦位于两个脑半球之间，在那里处于宁静的状态，无论脑子两边如何骚动、喧嚣。</p>

There was one who spoke to me close to my head, and I perceived from the sound that he was in a state of tranquillity like that of a kind of peaceful sleep. He inquired about this and that, but with 
so much prudence that a waking person could not display more. I perceived that the interior angels spoke through him, and that he was in a state to perceive and bring forth what they said. I asked about 
that state, and told him that he was in such a state. He replied that he speaks nothing but what is good and true, and that he takes notice whether there is anything else, and that if anything else 
inflows he does not admit it or utter it. As regards his state, he said that it was peaceful, as was also given me to perceive by communication. I was told that such are they who relate to the sinuses, 
or larger blood vessels in the brain; and that those who were like him relate to the longitudinal sinus, which is between the two hemispheres of the brain, and is there in a quiet state, however much 
the brain may be in tumult on both sides of it. </p>

There was a certain spirit close to my head who spoke to me. From the sound I perceived that his state was a state of tranquillity, like that of a peaceful sleep. He asked about this and that, but so 
cautiously that someone wide awake could not have displayed greater caution. I perceived that interior angels spoke through him, and that his state was one in which he perceived and reproduced what they 
said. I made some inquiries about that state and then I told him that the nature of it was as I had perceived it. He replied that he did not speak anything other than what was good and true, and that 
he detected whether anything else was present; and if anything other came along he did not entertain it or utter it. In reference to his state he said that it was peaceful, as I was also allowed to 
perceive through the communication of it to me. I was told that of such a nature were the spirits who correlate with the sinuses or major blood vessels in the brain, and that those who were like that 
particular spirit correlate with the longitudinal sinus which lies between the two hemispheres of the brain, and in a quiet state there even though the brain on either side of it may be in utter turmoil. </p>

Erat quidam prope ad caput meum qui mecum locutus; ex sono percepi quod in statu tranquillitatis, sicut cujusdam pacifici somni esset interrogavit hoc e illud, sed cum tali prudentia ut vigil non 
prudentius; perceptum quod angeli interiores per illum locuti sint, et is in statu esset ut perciperet et produceret; </p>
<p>quaesivi de statu illo, et ei dixi quod ei talis status respondit quod non loquatur 
aliud quam bonum et verum, et quod appercipiat num aliud, et si aliud influeret, quod non admittat seu eloquatur; </p>
<p>de statu suo dicebat quod pacificus esset, et illum quoque per communicationem 
percipere dabatur; dictum quod tales sint qui sinus seu vasa majora sanguines in cerebro referunt; et qui similes illi, Sinum Longitudinalem, qui est inter bina cerebri hemisphaeria, ac ibi in statu 
quieto, utcumque cerebrum utrinque tumultuatur. </p>
