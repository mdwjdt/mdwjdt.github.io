THE INTERNAL SENSE Verses 1-5. And Jethro, the priest of Midian, Moses' father-in-law, heard all that God had done for Moses, and for Israel His people, in that Jehovah had brought forth Israel out 
of Egypt; and Jethro, Moses' father-in-law, took Zipporah, Moses' wife, after he had sent her away. And her two sons, of which the name of the one was Gershom; for he said, I have been a sojourner in 
a strange land. And the name of the other Eliezer; Because the God of my father was my help, and liberated me from the sword of Pharaoh. And Jethro Moses' father-in-law came, and his sons, and his wife, 
unto Moses, into the wilderness where he was encamped at the mount of God. "And Jethro the priest of Midian," signifies the Divine good; "Moses' father-in-law," signifies from which is the good conjoined 
with truth Divine; "heard all that God had done for Moses, and for Israel His people," signifies the perception of those things which had been done for those who are of the Lord's spiritual kingdom; 
"in that Jehovah had brought forth Israel out of Egypt," signifies that they had been liberated by the Lord from infestations; "and Jethro Moses' father-in-law took Zipporah, Moses' wife," signifies 
good from the Divine conjoined with truth Divine; "after he had sent her away," signifies separation hitherto relatively to the state of those who are of the spiritual church; "and her two sons," 
signifies the goods of truth; "of which the name of the one was Gershom, for he said I have been a sojourner in a strange land," signifies the quality of the good of truth of those who are out of the 
church; "and the name of the other was Eliezer," signifies the quality of the good of truth of those who are within the church; "because the God of my father was my help," signifies the Lord's mercy 
and presence in the church; "and liberated me from the sword of Pharaoh," signifies liberation from the falsity of those who infested; "and Jethro Moses' father-in-law came," signifies the Divine good; 
"and his sons," signifies the goods of truth; "and his wife," signifies good conjoined with truth Divine; "unto Moses unto the wilderness," signifies conjunction in the state before regeneration when 
there are temptations; "where he was encamped at the mount of God," signifies near to the good of truth. </p>
