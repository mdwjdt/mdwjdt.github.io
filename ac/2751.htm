<h3 align="center" class="ired">属天的奥秘 第2751节</h3>
<h4 align="center"></h4><p><strong>2751.</strong>有一些灵人集结在我左眼前上方，他们在世时就这样暗中策划很多阴谋诡计算计别人。他们都是科行淫者，因刚到灵界，故仍在灵人界。他们惯于从他们团伙中四处派出一些人，以便不仅阴谋反对婚姻之爱，还阴谋反对善与真，尤其反对主。那些派出去的人回来报告他们所听见的；他们就这样密谋。他们以为我是个灵人，因我用灵人的语言说话，故也派了一个人到我这里来。这个使者一开口，就说了一些很可耻的话，绝大部分是攻击主的，以至于他本人可以说只会讲丑闻。我知道他来自哪个团伙，是什么样的渣滓，便回答说，他不该说这种话。至于主，我说，我毫无疑问地知道祂与父为一，整个天堂都是祂的；一切纯真、平安、爱、仁、怜悯，以及一切婚姻之爱、一切善与真皆源于祂；所有这一切都是神性。我还知道，摩西和众先知，就是圣言的每一个细节，就其内义而言，都在论述主；犹太教会的一切宗教仪式也都代表祂。我对这些事非常肯定，以至于没有一丝怀疑，他还想要什么？听到这一切，他羞愧地走了。我之所以告诉他这些事，是为了让他把这些事报告给那些组成派他来的邪恶团伙的行淫者们。</p>

Above in front before the left eye were massed together such as in the life of the body had in secret and with great craftiness plotted against others. They were adulterers, and were still in the world 
of spirits, as they were among the newcomers. Their custom was to send forth from their troop this way and that some to plot intrigues, not only against conjugial love, but also against good and truth, 
and most of all against the Lord. They who are thus sent out return to them, and relate what they have heard; and so they take counsel. They also sent one to me, supposing that I was a spirit, because 
I spoke with the speech of spirits. When that emissary spoke, he uttered scandalous things, mostly against the Lord; so that he was as it were made up of mere scandals. But I answered that he should 
abstain from such things, as I knew from what band and what refuse he was; and that as regards the Lord, I knew beyond all doubt that He is one with the Father; that the universal heaven is His; 
that all innocence, peace, love, charity, and mercy are from Him, and all conjugial love also; and that from Him are all good and truth; all of which things are Divine; and that Moses and the Prophets, 
that is, all and everything in the Word, in the internal sense, treats of Him; and that all the rites of the Jewish Church represented Him; and as I was so certain of these things that I had no doubt, 
what more did he want? On hearing these things he withdrew with shame. These things were said, that he might tell them to the adulterers who constituted that wicked troop from which he was sent. </p>

Bunched together - up above, in front of my left eye - there were spirits such as during their lifetime had in secret and with much cunning plotted against others. They were adulterers who, having arrived 
there only recently, were still in the world of spirits. It was their custom to send out from their bunch, in this direction and in that, some of their number, so that they might plot not only against 
conjugial love, but also against what is good and true, and most of all against the Lord. Those sent out come back to them and report what they have heard; and in this way they all take counsel. 
Thinking I was a spirit, because I spoke using the language of spirits, they also sent one to me. When this emissary spoke he said things that were completely scandalous, mostly against the Lord, so 
that he himself consisted so to speak of nothing but scandals. Aware of which bunch and what scum he was from I replied that he should refrain from uttering such things. As regards the Lord, I said, 
I knew without any shadow of doubt that He was one with the Father; that the whole of heaven was His; that all innocence, peace, love, charity, mercy, and also all conjugial love were derived from Him, 
as well as everything good and true; all of which things were Divine. And I knew that Moses and the Prophets, that is, every single detail of the Word in its internal sense, had reference to Him, and 
that all the religious observances of the Jewish Church were representative of Him. Since I was so certain of these matters as to have no doubt at all, what more could he want? On hearing all this, 
with shame he went away. He was told these things in order that he might report them to the adulterers who constituted that wicked bunch from which he had been sent. </p>

</p><b>2751.</b>
Antrorsum superius ante oculum sinistrum erant conglobati tale qui in vita corporis in occulto et callidius aliis insidiati sunt; erant adulteri, e adhuc in mundo spirituum, quia inter recentes; pro 
more habebant ex globo suo emittere aliquos huc illuc, qui insidientur non modo contra amorem conjugialem, sed etiam contra bonum et verum, et maxime contra Dominum; qui emittuntur, redeunt ad (c)illos, 
et narrant quid audiverunt, et sic consultant ad me miserunt etiam unum, putantes quod essem spiritus, quia locutus loquela spirituum; emissarius ille cum loqueretur, scandalosa effutiebat, maxime 
contra Dominum, sic ut esset ex quasi meris scandalis compositus; sed respondi, ut abstineret a talibus, sciens ex quo globo, et ex qua fece sit; quod Dominum attinet, novi absque omni dubio quod unus 
sit cum Patre, quod universum caelum `Ipsius sit', quod ab Ipso omnis innocentia, pax, amor, charitas, misericordia etiam omnis amor conjugialis, et ab Ipso omne bonum et verum, quae omnia sunt Divina; 
et quod de Ipso Moses et Prophetae, hoc est, omnia et singula Verbi in sensu interno, et quod Ipsam omnes ritus Ecclesiae Judaicae repraesentaverint, et quia de illis (o)ita certus sum ut nihil dubii, 
quid nunc amplius vellet; his auditis cum pudore recessit; dicebantur illa ut narraret adulteris qui constituebant nefandum illum globum, e quo missus. </p>
