<h3 align="center" class="ired">属天的奥秘 第3628节</h3>
<h4 align="center"></h4><p><strong>3628.</strong>关于这些问题，我已通过大量经历得到指教。事实上，我已经得知，不仅属于人类心智，即属于其思维与情感的事物对应于天堂从主那里所拥有的属灵和属天之物，而且整个人，无论总体还是它里面的任何具体细节，也都是对应的，以至于连最小的部分，甚至一个部分的最小成分，也无不是对应的。我还得知，人通过这种对应关系存在并持续存在；而且，如果人与天堂，并经由天堂与主，因而与先于自身之物，并经由这在先之物与那首先的没有这样一种对应关系，他刹那间就不会继续存在，而是化为乌有。<br />如前所述，总有两种力用来将一切事物联结在它自己的适当关联和适当形式中。也就是说，有一种力从外作用，有一种力从内作用，而被保持在关联和形式中的物体本身则处在这两种力的中间。人就其每一部分，甚至最微小的部分而言，也是如此。众所周知，周围的大气通过恒定的气压，或从外部施压，因而通过作用力将整个身体保持在联结状态，同样将它自己的具体器皿，也就是耳朵及其为空气变化而设计的形式保持在联结状态，这也是众所周知的。人们还知道，更微妙的以太大气以同样的方式维系着内部事物的联结，因为它通过气压或施压，因而通过作用力使整个身体的所有内脏保持完好无损。这种更精细的大气也有自己的具体器官，就是眼睛及其为这种大气，也就是以太的变化而构筑的形式。如果与这些相对应，并且与那些外力相互作用，从而使那些居间形式保持联结和平衡的内力不存在，居间事物就不会持续存在片刻。由此明显可知，若要任何事物存在并持续存在，这两种力都必须存在，并起作用。<br />从内流入并起作用的力源于天堂，并经由天堂源于主，它们拥有生命在里面。这一点从听觉器官很清楚地看出来：如果没有内在变化，也就是生命的变化，并且外在变化，也就是空气的变化与之相对应，就不会有听觉。这一点同样从视觉器官明显看出来：如果没有内在光明，也就是生命之光，并且外在光明，也就是阳光与之相对应，视觉也是不可能的。人体内的其它器官和肢体也一样：有从外作用的力，它们是属世的，本身没有任何生命可言；还有从内作用的力，它们本身拥有生命。这些力将一切器官联结起来，使它们存活，并且是照着为所发挥的功用而赋予这些器官的形式的性质这样做的。</p>

On this subject I have been instructed by much experience, and indeed that not only the things pertaining to the human mind, namely to its thought and affection, correspond to things spiritual and celestial 
which are of heaven from the Lord, but also the whole man in general, and in particular whatever is in man; insomuch that there is not the smallest part, nor even the smallest constituent of a 
part, which does not correspond; also that man exists and continually subsists therefrom; and further, that unless there were such a correspondence of man with heaven, and through heaven with the Lord, 
thus with what is prior to himself, and through prior things with the First, he would not subsist even a moment, but would dissolve into nothing. [2] There are always two forces which, as before said, 
keep everything in its connection and in its form, namely, a force acting from without, and a force acting from within, in the midst of which forces is that which is kept in connection and form; 
thus is it with man as to every part of him, even the most minute. That the atmospheres are that which from without keep the whole body in connection, by their continual pressure or incumbence and the 
consequent acting force, is known; and also that the aerial atmosphere by its inflow keeps the lungs in their connection and form, and likewise its organ which is the ear, with its forms constructed 
therein according to the modifications of the air. It is also known that the ethereal atmosphere in like manner maintains the interior connections; for this atmosphere flows in freely through all the 
pores, and keeps the interior viscera of the whole body inseparable in their forms, by nearly the same pressure or incumbence, and the consequent acting force; also that the same atmosphere keeps in connection 
and form its organ which is the eye, with its forms therein constructed to the modifications of the ether. Unless there were internal forces correspondent to these which should react against 
the external forces and thus keep the intermediate forms in connection and equilibrium, they would not subsist a moment. [3] From this it is evident that in order that anything may exist and subsist 
there must needs be two forces. The forces which flow in and act from within are from heaven and through heaven from the Lord, and have in themselves life. This is very clearly manifest from the organ 
of hearing: unless there were interior modifications, which are of life, and to which correspond the exterior modifications which are of the air, there would be no hearing. The same is also evident 
from the organ of sight: unless there were interior light which is of life, and to which corresponds the exterior light which is of the sun, no vision would be possible. The case is the same with all 
the other organs and members in the human body: there are forces acting from without, which are natural and in themselves not living, and there are forces acting from within, in themselves living, which 
keep every organ in its connection, and cause it to live, and this according to the form such as has been given them for use. </p>

<p align="center"><b>Elliott(1983-1999) 3628</b></p><p><b>3628.</b>
Much experience has taught me about these matters. Indeed it has taught me that not only things of the human mind, namely those belonging to its thought and affection, correspond to spiritual and celestial 
things which heaven has from the Lord, but also that the whole of a person in general, and whatever exists in him in particular, corresponds, so much so that neither the smallest part, nor even 
the smallest fraction of a part, fails to correspond. Such experience has also taught me that it is from this correspondence that man comes into being, and is constantly kept in being; and also that 
but for such correspondence of the human being with heaven, and through heaven with the Lord - and so with what is prior to himself, and with what is First through things that are prior - he would not 
continue in being for one instant but would dissolve into nothingness. </p>
<p></p>
<p><b>[2]</b>
 There are always two forces which, as stated above, serve to hold everything together in its own proper connection and proper 
form. That is to say, there is a force acting from without and a force acting from within, and in the midst of these is the object itself which is being held together by them. The same is also true 
of the human being as regards every individual part of him, even the tiniest part. It is well known that the surrounding atmospheres hold the whole body in a state of cohesion by their constant pressure 
or bearing down on it from without, and therefore by their acting as a force upon it. It is also well known that the atmosphere, entering as air into the lungs, keeps these in a state of cohesion, 
as it also does its own particular organ, the ear, together with its forms which are designed for the changes that take place in it. It is well known too that the subtler etherical atmosphere in a 
similar way holds interior things in connection, for it flows in freely through all the pores of the skin, and by means of an almost identical pressure, bearing down, and therefore force acting upon them, 
keeps intact each of the internal organs of the whole body. This finer atmosphere too has its own particular organ, the eye, together with its forms which are equipped for changes that take place 
in this atmosphere. Unless these had internal forces corresponding to them which reacted against those external forces and in so doing held together and placed in equilibrium those intermediate forms, 
the latter would not remain in being for a single moment. From this it is evident that two forces have to be at work if anything is to come into being and be kept in being. </p>
<p></p>
<p><b>[3]</b>
 The forces flowing 
and acting from within originate in heaven, and in the Lord by way of heaven; and they have life within them. This is evident quite clearly from the organ of hearing. Except for interior changes, which 
are those of life, and to which exterior changes correspond, which are those of the air, hearing would never become a reality. It is likewise evident from the organ of sight. Except for interior light, 
which is that of life and to which exterior light, which is that of the sun, corresponds, sight would never become a reality. The same is so with all the other organs and limbs in the human body. 
There are forces at work outwardly, which are natural and in themselves do not possess any life, and forces at work inwardly which do in themselves have life. These forces hold everything together and 
cause them to have life, doing so in accordance with the nature of the form conferred on them for the purpose they serve. </p>

De his per multam experientiam instructus sum, et quidem quod non solum illa quae sunt mentis humanae, nempe quae sunt ejus cogitationis et affectionis, spiritualibus et caelestibus quae sunt caeli 
a Domino, correspondeant, sed etiam quod in communi totus homo, et in particulari quicquid est in homine, usque adeo ut non detur minima pars, ne quidem minimum partis, quod non correspondet; {1}tum quod 
homo inde existat et continue subsistat: {2}et quoque, nisi foret talis correspondentia hominis cum caelo, et per caelum cum Domino, ita cum priore se, et per priora cum Primo, ne quidem momento subsisteret 
sed difflueret in nullum.  [2] Sunt semper binae vires quae unumquodvis in suo nexu et in sua forma, ut supra dictum, (x)continent, vis nempe extrinsecus agens, et vis intrinsecus agens, in 
quarum medio sit illud quod continetur; ita quoque homo quoad singulas suas partes, etiam minutissimas: quod atmosphaerae sint quae extrinsecus per continuam pressionem seu incumbentiam, et inde vim 
agentem, totum corpus in nexu (x)teneant, notum est; et quoque quod atmosphaera {3}aeris per influxum pulmones; {4}et eadem suum organum quod est auris, cum ejus formis ad modificationes {4}illius (x)constructis 
inibi; et quod atmosphaera aetherea similiter nexus interiores, nam haec libere per omnes poros influit, et totius corporis viscera interiora, paene simili pressione, incumbentia, et inde 
vi agente, in formis suis indivulsa tenet, et {5}eadem quoque atmosphaera suum organum quod est oculus, cum ejus formis ad modificationes ejus instructis, inibi: his nisi corresponderent vires internae 
quae contra vires illas externas reagerent, et sic formas intermedias {6}continerent et aequilibrarent, ne quidem momento subsisterent; [3] inde patet quod binae vires omnino erunt ut aliquid existat 
et subsistat; vires quae intrinsecus influunt et agunt, sunt ex caelo, et per caelum a Domino, ac in se vitam habent. Hoc patet admodum manifeste ab organo auditus; nisi modificationes interiores forent 
quae sunt vitae, quibus corresponderent modificationes exteriores quae sunt aeris, non existeret auditus; et quoque ab organo visus, nisi lux interior foret quae est vitae, cui corresponderet lux 
exterior quae est solis, nusquam existeret visus. Ita se habet cum omnibus reliquis organis et membris in corpore humano; sunt vires extra agentes quae naturales sunt, in se non vivae, et sunt vires 
intra agentes in se vivae, quae continent unumquodvis, et faciunt ut vivant, et quidem secundum formam qualis eis data est ad usum. @1 et$ @2 tum$ @3 aerea$ @4 et simul eadem ipsum suum organum$ @5 
quoque eadem$ @6 in aequilibrio continerent$ </p>
