<h3 align="center" class="ired">属天的奥秘 第8361节</h3>
<h4 align="center"></h4><p><strong>8361.</strong>“又行祂眼中看为正的事”表照诫命生活。这从“行正的事”和“耶和华眼中”的含义清楚可知：“行正的事”是指照真理的指示生活；“耶和华眼中”是指在主面前，因而是指照着祂的诫命，因为当一个人照主的诫命生活时，主在祂的诫命里面；一个拥有对主之信的人也可以说在“祂眼中”。至于“听从声音”，严格来说，它表示顺服（<a href="2542.htm">2542</a>，<a href="3869.htm">3869</a>，<a href="5017.htm">5017</a>节）；但当经上如此处那样还提到“行”这个动词时，在这种情况下，“听从”表示信，“行”表示生活，这从主在以下经文中的话可以看出来：<br />凡听见我这话就去行的，好比一个聪明人；凡听见我这话不去行的，好比一个愚拙的人。（马太福音<a href="http://39-27.cn/太7.24.htm">7:24</a>，<a href="http://39-27.cn/太7.26.htm">26</a>）<br />路加福音：<br />凡到我这里来，听见我的话就去行的，我要告诉你们他像什么人。（路加福音<a href="http://39-27.cn/路6.47.htm">6:47</a>）<br /><br />那落在好土里的种子，就是人听了圣言，持守在诚实善良的心里，并且忍耐着结实。（路加福音<a href="http://39-27.cn/路8.15.htm">8:15</a>）<br /><br />耶稣说，听了神的话而遵行的人就是我的母亲，我的弟兄了。（路加福音<a href="http://39-27.cn/路8.21.htm">8:21</a>）<br />在这些经文中，“听”表示觉知、理解并有信；“行”表示照它们生活。但当经上只提到“听”，没有同时提到“行”时，“听”表示表示意愿和行为上的信，因而表示顺服。原因在于，所听到的东西进入内视，也就是理解力，在那里被意愿持守，并如同通过一个循环那样进入行为。这解释了为何从它所描述的活动的性质来看，“听”这个词能表示顺服，如我们论到“听”或“听从”某人时所说的那样（参看<a href="4652.htm">4652</a>-<a href="4660.htm">4660</a>节）。</p>

<p align="center"><b>Potts(1905-1910) 8361</b></p><p><b>8361.</b>
And wilt do what is right in His eyes. That this signifies a life according to them, is evident from the signification of "doing what is right," as being to live according to the dictate of truth; and 
from the signification of "in the eyes of Jehovah," as being before the Lord, thus according to His commandments, for the Lord is in His commandments when a man lives according to them; he also is said 
to be "in the eyes of the Lord" who is in faith in Him. As regards "hearing a voice," this properly signifies obedience (n. 2542, 3869, 5017); but when as here mention is also made of "doing," then 
"to hear" signifies faith, and "to do" signifies life, as can be seen from the Lord's words in these passages: </p>
<p>     Everyone that heareth My words, and doeth them, I will compare him to a prudent man; 
but everyone that heareth My words, but doeth them not, shall be compared to a foolish man (Matt. 7:24, 26).      Everyone that cometh unto Me, and heareth My discourses, and doeth them, I will show 
you to whom he is like (Luke 6:47).      The seed that is in the good ground, these are they who in a simple and good heart, hear the word, hold it fast, and bear fruit in patience (Luke 8:15).  
    Jesus said, My mother and My brethren are these, who hear the word of God and do it (Luke 8:21). In these passages "to hear" signifies to perceive, to understand, and to have faith; and "to do" 
signifies to live according to these. But where "hearing" is spoken of, and not at the same time "doing," then "hearing" signifies faith in will and act, thus obedience. The reason is that what is heard 
passes into the internal sight, which is the understanding, and is there laid hold of by the will, and passes as by a circuit into act. Consequently in the word "hear," there is naturally the signification 
of obedience, as we speak of "hearing" or "hearkening to" anyone (see n. 4652-4660). </p>

<p align="center"><b>Elliott(1983-1999) 8361</b></p><p><b>8361.</b>
'And do what is right in His eyes' means a life in keeping with them. This is clear from the meaning of 'doing what is right' as leading a life in keeping with what truth dictates; and from the meaning 
of 'in Jehovah's eyes' as before the Lord, thus in keeping with His commandments, since the Lord is within His commandments when a person leads a life in keeping with them. Also a person who possesses 
faith in the Lord is said to be 'in His eyes'. As regards 'hearing the voice', its proper meaning is obedience, <a href="2542.htm">2542</a>, <a href="3869.htm">3869</a>, <a href="5017.htm">5017</a>. But when the verb 'doing' is used as well, as it is here, 'hearing' 
in that case means faith and 'doing' means life, as may be recognized from the Lord's words in Matthew, </p>
<blockquote>
Everyone who hears My words and does them I will liken to a wise man. But everyone hearing 
My words yet not doing them will be likened to a foolish man. <a href="http://bible.gospelcom.net/cgi-bin/bible?passage=Matt%207:24,%2026&amp;version=ESV&amp;interface=print&amp;showfn=yes&amp;showxref">Matt 7:24, 26</a>. 
</blockquote>
<p>In Luke, </p>
<blockquote>
Everyone who comes to Me, and hears My sayings and does them, I will show you whom he is like. <a href="http://bible.gospelcom.net/cgi-bin/bible?passage=Luke%206:47&amp;version=ESV&amp;interface=print&amp;showfn=yes&amp;showxref">Luke 6:47</a>.

<p>In 
the same gospel, </p>
<p>The seed which [fell] on the good earth - these are they who with a simple and good heart hear the Word, keep it, and bear fruit<A name="fntext1"></a><A href="#fn1"><sup>a</sup></a>' with patience. <a href="http://bible.gospelcom.net/cgi-bin/bible?passage=Luke%208:15&amp;version=ESV&amp;interface=print&amp;showfn=yes&amp;showxref">Luke 8:15</a>. </p>
<p>In the same gospel, </p>
<blockquote>
Jesus 
said, My mother and My brothers are these who hear the word of God and do it. <a href="http://bible.gospelcom.net/cgi-bin/bible?passage=Luke%208:21&amp;version=ESV&amp;interface=print&amp;showfn=yes&amp;showxref">Luke 8:21</a>. 
</blockquote>
<p>In these places 'hearing' means having perception, understanding, and faith; and 'doing' means 
leading a life in keeping with them. But when 'hearing' is used by itself and not together with 'doing' it means faith in will and action, thus obedience. The reason why is that what a person hears passes 
into his inward power of sight which belongs to the understanding; there it is embraced by the will and completes a kind of circle that passes into action. This explains why the actual word 'hear', 
from the nature of the activity it describes, may mean obedience, as in the expression to hear or else hearken to someone, see <a href="4652.htm">4652</a>-<a href="4660.htm">4660</a>.

`Et rectum in oculis {1}Ipsius feceris': quod significet vitam secundum illa, constat ex significatione `rectum facere' quod sit vivere secundum {2}dictamen veri; et ex significatione `in oculis Jehovae' 
quod sit coram Domino, ita secundum praecepta Ipsius, nam Dominus est in praeceptis Suis cum vivitur secundum illa; is quoque dicitur `in oculis Domini esse' qui in fide in Ipsum est.  Quod `vocem 
audire' attinet, significat (x)id proprie oboedientiam, n. 2542, 3869, 5017; sed cum quoque dicitur `facere,' ut hic, tunc `audire' significat fidem, et `facere' vitam, ut constare potest a Domini 
verbis apud Matthaeum, Omnis qui audit Mea verba et facit ea, comparabo viro prudenti; at omnis audiens verba Mea, sed non faciens ea, comparabitur viro stulto, vii 24, 26: </p>
<p>apud Lucam, Omnis qui venit 
ad Me, et audit sermones Meos facitque eos, monstrabo vobis cui similis {3}est, vi 47: </p>
<p>apud eundem, Semen quod in terra bona, tu sunt qui in corde simplici et bono audiunt verbum, retinent, et fructum

intelligere, et fidem habere, {5} `facere' significat vivere secundum illa; at ubi `audire' dicitur et non simul `facere,' tunc `audire' significat fidem voluntate et actu, ita oboedientiam; causa est 
quia quod auditur, hoc transit in visum internum qui intellectus, et ibi excipitur a voluntate, et transit sicut per circulum in actum; inde voci audire inest {6} natura significatio oboedientiae, prout
