<h3 align="center" class="ired">属天的奥秘 第10560节</h3>
<h4 align="center"></h4><p><strong>10560</strong>.“看哪，你对我说，将这百姓领上去”表对教会要与这个民族同住的庄严承诺。这从“你对我说”和“将这百姓领上去”的含义清楚可知：当所说的话是耶和华说的时，“你对我说”是指一个庄严的承诺；“将这百姓领上去”是指教会要建立在这个民族当中。这些就是这些话在内义上所表示的事；但就最接近文字的意义（注：即内在历史意义）而言，意思是他们要被领进迦南地，并占有它。被领进迦南地并占有它表示建立教会（参看<a href="10559.htm">10559</a>节）。至于这些事是何情形，这在前面的各个地方已经说明，也就是说，在这个民族当中不可能建立起一个教会，只能建立一个教会的代表，因为他们的兴趣在于与内在之物分离的外在事物；像这样的人无法接受来自神性的任何流注；然而，与人同住的教会在他里面的内在之物中，不在与内在之物分离的外在之物中。像这样的人确实能代表教会，但不能成为一个教会。代表教会，但不是一个教会，就是敬拜外在事物，称它们为神圣和神性，却不以源于天堂的信和爱来承认或感知它们。关于“使这百姓上到那地”的含义的说明，可参看前文（<a href="10526.htm">10526</a>节）。</p>

See, Thou sayest unto me, Make this people come up. That this signifies a solemn promise that the church should be with that nation, is evident from the signification of "Thou sayest unto me," when the 
saying is by Jehovah, as being a solemn promise; and from the signification of "making this people come up," as being that the church should be set up with that nation. These are the things which are 
signified in the internal sense by these words. But in the sense nearest the letter is signified that they should be brought into the land of Canaan and should possess it. (That to be brought into 
the land of Canaan and to possess it denotes to set up the church, see above, n. 10559.) How the case is in regard to these things has been shown throughout in the preceding pages, namely, that no church 
could be instituted with that nation, but only the representative of a church, because they were in external things separate from what is internal, and those who are of such a character cannot receive 
any influx from the Divine; and yet the church with man is in his internal, but not in what is external separate therefrom. They who are of such a character can indeed represent the church, but cannot 
be the church. To represent the church and not be the church is to worship external things, and to call them holy and Divine; but not to acknowledge and perceive them in faith and love from heaven. 
(See what has been said above concerning the signification of "making the people come up into the land," in n. 10526.) </p>

'See, You say to me, Cause this people to go up' means the solemn promise of a Church among that nation. This is clear from the meaning of 'You say to me', when what had been said had been said by Jehovah, 
as a solemn promise; and from the meaning of 'cause this people to go up' as that the Church may be established among that nation. These are the things that are meant in the internal sense by those 
words; but in the proximate sense<A name="fntext1"></a><A href="#fn1"><sup>a</sup></a> the meaning is that they would be led into and take possession of the land of Canaan. For this meaning of being led into and taking possession of the land of Canaan 
as establishing the Church, see above in <a href="10559.htm">10559</a>. What all this entails has been shown in various places in what has gone before, that is to say, places which show that no Church could be established 
among that nation, only what was representative of the Church, because their interest lay in external things separated from what was internal; that people such as these cannot receive any influx from 
the Divine; and that yet the Church resides with a person in what is internal in him, not in what is external separated from it. People such as these are indeed able to represent the Church, but not 
to be a Church. To represent the Church but not to be a Church is the situation when people cultivate things of an external nature, calling them holy and Divine, yet do not acknowledge or perceive them 
with faith and love derived from heaven. See what has been stated above in <a href="10526.htm">10526</a> about the meaning of 'causing the people to go up into the land'.

`Vide, Tu dicis ad me, Ascendere fac populum hunc': quod significet sponsionem Ecclesiae apud illam gentem, constat ex significatione `Tu dicis ad me' cum a Jehovah, quod sit sponsio, et ex significatione 
`ascendere fac populum hunc' quod sit ut apud illam gentem instauretur Ecclesiae; haec sunt quae in sensu interno per illa verba significantur, at in sensu proximo quod introducerentur in terram 
Canaanem, et possiderent illam; quod introduci in {1}terram Canaanem et possidere eam, sit instaurare Ecclesiam, videatur supra n. 10559.  Quomodo cum his se habet, in praecedentibus passim ostensum 
est, quod nempe apud illam gentem non aliqua Ecclesiae institui potuerit sed modo repraesentativum Ecclesiae, quoniam in externis separatis ab interno fuit; et qui tales sunt non aliquem influxum a Divino 
recipere possunt; et usque Ecclesia apud hominem est in interno ejus, non autem in externo separato ab illo; qui tales sunt, quidem repraesentare Ecclesiam possunt, non autem esse Ecclesia; repraesentare 
Ecclesiam et non esse Ecclesia, est colere externa, et vocare illa sancta et Divina, non autem agnoscere et percipere illa fide et amore e caelo.  Videantur quae supra de significatione `ascendere 
facere populum in terram' n. 10526 dicta sunt. @1 illam terram$ </p>
