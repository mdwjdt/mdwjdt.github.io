<h3 align="center" class="ired">属天的奥秘 第5376节</h3>
<h4 align="center"></h4><p><strong>5376.</strong>“因为全地的饥荒都很厉害”表除了那里外，荒凉在属世层里面无处不在。这从“饥荒”和“地”的含义清楚可知：“饥荒”是指荒凉，如前所述；“地”是指属世层，也如前所述。所指的是除了那里，也就是说，除了属灵层的属天层所在的记忆知识外的处处；这一观念从前文可推知。前面阐述了属世层的荒凉，或那里真理的剥夺是何情形；但由于下文论述的仍是这个主题，故必须再说一说它的性质。出生在教会的人自幼小的童年起，就从圣言和教会的教义学习何为信之真理，以及何为仁之良善。但长大成人后，他开始自己要么确认，要么拒绝接受他所学到的信之真理；因为那时，他以自己的眼光看待这些真理，由此使这些真理要么变成他自己的，要么抛弃它们。因为真理不可能变成人自己的，除非他凭自己的领悟承认它，也就是说，除非他靠自己知道这是真的，而非仰赖别人。因此，自童年时所学到的真理无法更深地进入人的生命，只停留在第一道入口处，或外大门；它们在那里要么被引进来，要么被扔在外面。<br />对那些正经历重生的人，也就是那些主所预见、肯让自己重生的人来说，这些真理会大大增多，因为这些人拥有认识真理的情感。但当日益接近重生实际发生的点时，他们似乎被剥夺了这些真理。因为这些真理向内退去，当这种情况发生时，此人似乎陷入荒凉。然而，随着重生的继续，这些真理会连续不断地回到属世层，在那里与良善联结。但对那些不经历重生的人，也就是那些主所预见、不肯让自己重生的人来说，诚然，真理通常会增多，因为这些人为了名声、地位和利益的缘故，也拥有认识真理的情感。然而，随着年龄增长，并以自己的眼光看待这些真理，他们要么不相信它们，或不肯接受它们，要么将它们变为虚假。因此，对他们来说，真理不是向内退去，而是被扔在外面；虽然为了服务世俗目的，它们仍留在记忆中，但却没有生命。在圣言中，这种状态被称为荒凉或荒废，但不同于前一种状态，因为属于前一种状态的荒凉只是表面上的，而属于这后一种状态的荒凉则是绝对、彻底的。事实上，在前一种状态，人并未被剥夺真理，而在这后一种状态，他完全被剥夺了真理。前一种状态的荒凉就是本章内义所论述的主题，也是下文所论述的主题；持续七年的饥荒就表示这种荒凉。<br />在圣言的其它地方，经上多次提到这种荒凉，如以赛亚书：<br />耶路撒冷啊，醒来！醒来！你从耶和华手中喝了祂忿怒之杯；荒凉与毁灭，饥荒与刀剑，这两样临到你，谁为你悲哀呢？我如何能安慰你呢？你的众子发昏，在各街头躺卧。因此，你这困苦却非因酒而醉的，要听我言。看哪！我已将那使人颤抖的杯，就是我烈怒之杯的沉渣，从你手中接过来，你必不至再喝。我必将这杯递在苦待你的人手中。（以赛亚书<a href="http://39-27.cn/赛51.17.htm">51:17</a>-<a href="http://39-27.cn/赛51.23.htm">23</a>）<br />这段经文描述了正在变成一个教会，或正在重生的教会成员所陷入的荒凉。这种荒凉被称为“荒凉”、“毁灭”、“饥荒”、“刀剑”，以及“耶和华忿怒和烈怒之杯”、“颤抖的杯”。那时他被剥夺的真理就是“发昏，在各街头躺卧”的“众子”。因为“众子”是指真理（参看<a href="489.htm">489</a>，<a href="491.htm">491</a>，<a href="533.htm">533</a>，<a href="1147.htm">1147</a>，<a href="2623.htm">2623</a>，<a href="2803.htm">2803</a>，<a href="2813.htm">2813</a>，<a href="3373.htm">3373</a>节），“街”是指真理所在的地方（<a href="2336.htm">2336</a>节）；因此，“在各街头躺卧”表示真理看似被驱散了。显而易见，这种荒凉只是表面上的，重生通过它如同通过试探那样实现；因为经上说耶路撒冷“必不至再喝”，祂“必将这杯递在苦待你的人手中”。<br />以西结书：<br />主耶和华如此说，因为他们使你荒凉，四围吞吃，好叫你归与残余民族为业，故此，以色列山要听主耶和华的话。大山小冈、水沟山谷、荒凉荒废之地、被弃之城，为四围残余民族所劫掠所嗤笑的；我发愤恨和忿怒说，因你们曾受列族的羞辱。你们四围的列族，这些人必担当自己的羞辱；以色列山哪，你必发枝条，为我的民以色列结果子。看哪！我与你同在，必转而垂顾你们，使你们得以耕种和撒种；我必使以色列全家的人数在你上面增多，城邑有人居住，荒场再被建造。我要使你如同昔日一样有人居住，优待你们胜过先前。（以西结书<a href="http://39-27.cn/结36.3.htm">36:3</a>-<a href="http://39-27.cn/结36.12.htm">12</a>）<br />这论述的也是重生之前的荒凉。“荒凉荒废之地”、“为四围残余民族所劫掠所嗤笑的被弃之城”表示这种荒凉；而“发枝条，结果子”、“转而垂顾你们，使你们得以耕种和撒种，使人数增多，城邑有人居住，荒场再被建造”、“使你如同昔日一样有人居住，优待你们胜过先前”表示重生。<br />至于荒凉是何情形，这从那些在来世陷入荒凉的人明显看出来。在那里，那些陷入荒凉的人被恶灵和魔鬼纠缠；他们灌入邪恶与虚假的信念，直到他们几乎被淹没、有压垮；结果，真理不得而见；但随着荒凉的时间结束，他们被天堂所得来的光所光照，恶灵和魔鬼也以这种方式被赶走，各回各的地狱，在那里受到惩罚。这些惩罚就是“为四围残余民族所劫掠所嗤笑的城”和“担当自己羞辱的四围的列族”所表示的。这类惩罚也由前面从以赛亚书所引用经文中的“递在苦待你的人手中的杯”，以及以赛亚书其它经文中“毁灭人的”（以赛亚书<a href="http://39-27.cn/赛33.1.htm">33:1</a>）来表示。还有耶利米书：<br />我必刑罚毁灭人的，叫他们永远荒凉。（耶利米书<a href="http://39-27.cn/耶25.12.htm">25:12</a>）<br />以赛亚书：<br />毁坏你的必使你的儿女急速归回；使你荒废的，必都离你出去。你举目向四方观看，他们都聚集来到你这里。至于你荒废凄凉之处，并你被毁坏之地，如今为居民必显为太窄；吞灭你的必离你遥远。（以赛亚书<a href="http://39-27.cn/赛49.17.htm">49:17</a>-<a href="http://39-27.cn/赛49.19.htm">19</a>）<br />这几节，事实上整个这一章论述的主题都是那些正在重生之人所经受的荒凉，以及荒凉过后他们的重生和结实，26节最后论述了对那些逼迫他们之人的惩罚。同一先知书：<br />祸哉！你这毁灭人的，自己倒不被毁灭；你毁灭罢休了，自己必被毁灭。（以赛亚书<a href="http://39-27.cn/赛33.1.htm">33:1</a>）<br />这论及对毁灭人者的惩罚，和前面一样。同一先知书：<br />求你容我这被赶散的人住在你中间；至于摩押，求你作她的隐密处，脱离毁灭者的面。勒索人的归于无有，毁灭的事止息了。（以赛亚书<a href="http://39-27.cn/赛16.4.htm">16:4</a>）<br /><br />因为耶和华的日子临近了！这日来到，好像毁灭从沙代来到。（以赛亚书<a href="http://39-27.cn/赛13.6.htm">13:6</a>）<br />“从沙代来到的毁灭”表示试探中的消磨，因为试探方面的神被古人称为沙代（参看<a href="1992.htm">1992</a>，<a href="3667.htm">3667</a>，<a href="4572.htm">4572</a>节）。<br /><br />那时，他们并不干渴；祂引导他们经过荒漠之野。祂为他们使水从磐石出；分裂磐石，水就涌出。（以赛亚书<a href="http://39-27.cn/赛48.21.htm">48:21</a>）<br />这论及荒凉过后的状态。<br />耶和华已经安慰锡安，安慰她一切的荒场，使她的旷野像伊甸，她的荒漠像耶和华的园囿；在其中必有欢喜、快乐、感谢和歌唱的声音。（以赛亚书<a href="http://39-27.cn/赛51.3.htm">51:3</a>）<br />此处论述的主题是一样的，因为如前所述，荒凉的发生是为了这一目的，即叫人能重生，也就是邪恶与虚假首先他那里分离出去，然后真理与良善联结，良善与真理联结。就良善而言，重生之人就是那被比作“伊甸”的；就真理而言，重生之人就是那被比作“耶和华的园囿”的。诗篇：<br />耶和华从毁灭坑里、从淤泥中把我拉上来，使我的脚立在磐石上。（诗篇<a href="http://39-27.cn/诗40.2.htm">40:2</a>）<br />教会成员或人里面的教会所经受的荒凉和荒废由犹太人在巴比伦的被掳来代表；教会的兴起则由从那掳掠当中归回来代表，如耶利米书的各处所述，尤其32章37节直至结束。事实上，荒凉就是掳掠，因为那时此人可以说被囚禁；因此，“被掳的”、“坐监的”和“下在坑里的”表示那些陷入荒凉的人（参看<a href="4728.htm">4728</a>，<a href="4744.htm">4744</a>，<a href="5037.htm">5037</a>，<a href="5038.htm">5038</a>，<a href="5085.htm">5085</a>，<a href="5096.htm">5096</a>节）。<br />圣言的各处也提到了那些未经历重生的人当中的荒凉和荒废的状态。那些否认真理，或将它们转变为虚假的人便处于这种状态；这就是教会走向终结时的状态，那时信和仁不复存在。以赛亚书：<br />我要叫你们知道，我要向我葡萄园怎样行：我必撤去它的篱笆，使它被吞灭；拆毁它的墙垣，使它被践踏。我必使它荒废，不再修理，不再锄刨，荆棘蒺藜倒要长起来。我也必命云不降雨在其上。（以赛亚书<a href="http://39-27.cn/赛5.5.htm">5:5</a>-<a href="http://39-27.cn/赛5.6.htm">6</a>）<br />同一先知书：<br />你去告诉这百姓说，你们听是要听见，却不明白；看是要看见，却不晓得。要使这百姓心蒙脂油，耳朵发沉，眼睛昏迷；恐怕眼睛看见，耳朵听见，心里明白，回转过来，便得医治。于是我说，主啊！这要多久呢？祂说，直到城邑荒凉，无人居住，房屋空闲无人，地土极其荒凉。并且耶和华将人迁到远方，在这境内撇下的地土很多；境内剩下的人若还有十分之一，也必被吞灭。（以赛亚书<a href="http://39-27.cn/赛6.9.htm">6:9</a>-<a href="http://39-27.cn/赛6.13.htm">13</a>）<br />同一先知书：<br />所剩下的，就是雅各家所剩下的，必归回大能的神。原来灭绝的事已定，满有公义涨溢。因为主万军之耶和华在全地之中，必成就所定规的结局。（以赛亚书<a href="http://39-27.cn/赛10.21.htm">10:21</a>-<a href="http://39-27.cn/赛10.23.htm">23</a>）<br />耶和华使地空虚，变为荒凉；又翻转地面。地必全然空虚，可居之地悲哀衰残，世界败落衰残，地被咒诅吞灭；新酒悲哀，葡萄树衰残；城门所剩下的只有荒凉，城门被撞得粉碎。地全然破坏，地尽都崩裂，地大大震动。地要东倒西歪，好像醉酒的人。（以赛亚书<a href="http://39-27.cn/赛24.1.htm">24:1</a>-<a href="http://39-27.cn/赛24.23.htm">23</a>）<br />大路荒凉，行人止息；地上悲哀衰残；黎巴嫩羞愧枯干；沙仑像旷野。（以赛亚书<a href="http://39-27.cn/赛33.8.htm">33:8</a>-<a href="http://39-27.cn/赛33.9.htm">9</a>）<br />我要制造荒凉，一起吞灭；我要使大山小冈变为荒场，使一切花草都枯干。（以赛亚书<a href="http://39-27.cn/赛42.14.htm">42:14</a>-<a href="http://39-27.cn/赛42.15.htm">15</a>）<br />耶利米书：<br />我必将四围一切的众族尽行灭绝，使他们令人惊骇、嗤笑，并且永久荒凉。我又要使欢喜的声音和快乐的声音，新郎的声音和新妇的声音，推磨的声音和灯的亮光，从他们中间止息。这全地必然荒凉，令人惊骇。七十年满了以后，我必刑罚巴比伦王和那民族，并迦勒底人之地，因他们的罪孽使那地永远荒凉。（耶利米书<a href="http://39-27.cn/耶25.9.htm">25:9</a>-<a href="http://39-27.cn/耶25.12.htm">12</a>及以后）<br />波斯拉必令人惊骇、羞辱、咒诅，并且荒凉。她的一切城邑必变为永远的荒场。以东必令人惊骇；凡经过的人就受惊骇，又因他一切的灾祸嗤笑。（耶利米书<a href="http://39-27.cn/耶49.13.htm">49:13</a>-<a href="http://39-27.cn/耶49.18.htm">18</a>）<br />以西结书：<br />主论耶路撒冷和以色列地的居民如此说，他们吃饭必忧虑，喝水必惊惶，因其中居住的众人所行强暴的事，这地必然荒废，一无所存。有居民的城邑必变为荒场，地也必变为荒废。（以西结书<a href="http://39-27.cn/结12.19.htm">12:19</a>-<a href="http://39-27.cn/结12.20.htm">20</a>）<br /><br />我使你变为荒凉的城邑，如无人居住的城邑；又使深水漫过你，大水淹没你。那时我就叫你跟那些下阴坑的人一起下到古时的人那里；我要使你和下到阴坑的人一同住在地的深处，在久已荒废的地方。（以西结书<a href="http://39-27.cn/结26.19.htm">26:19</a>-<a href="http://39-27.cn/结26.21.htm">21</a>）<br />这论及推罗。约珥书：<br />一个黑暗、幽冥的日子，一个密云、乌黑的日子；他们前面如火烧灭，后面如火焰烧尽。未到以前，地如伊甸园，过去以后，成了荒凉的旷野。（约珥书<a href="http://39-27.cn/珥2.2.htm">2:2</a>-<a href="http://39-27.cn/珥2.3.htm">3</a>）<br />西番雅书：<br />耶和华的大日临近，那日是忿怒的日子，是急难困苦的日子，是荒废凄凉的日子，是黑暗、幽冥的日子，密云乌黑的日子；耶和华的忿怒如火，必烧灭全地，毁灭这地的一切居民，而且大大毁灭。（西番雅书<a href="http://39-27.cn/番1.14.htm">1:14</a>-<a href="http://39-27.cn/番1.18.htm">18</a>）<br />马太福音：<br />你们看见先知但以理所预言那行毁坏可憎的，站在圣地，那时，在犹太的，应当逃到山上。（马太福音<a href="http://39-27.cn/太24.15.htm">24:15</a>-<a href="http://39-27.cn/太24.16.htm">16</a>；马可福音<a href="http://39-27.cn/可13.14.htm">13:14</a>；但以理书<a href="http://39-27.cn/但9.27.htm">9:27</a>；<a href="http://39-27.cn/但12.10.htm">12:10</a>-<a href="http://39-27.cn/但12.12.htm">12</a>）<br />从这些经文明显可知，荒凉对那些正经历重生的人来说，是看似真理的剥夺；但对那些未经历重生的人来说，则是绝对、完全的剥夺。</p>

<p align="center"><b>Potts(1905-1910) 5376</b></p><p><b>5376.</b>
Because the famine was strengthened in all the earth. That this signifies that everywhere, except there, was there desolation in the natural, is evident from the signification of "famine," as being desolation 
(of which above); and from the signification of "earth," as being the natural (of which also above). Its being everywhere except there, namely, in the memory-knowledges where the celestial of 
the spiritual was, follows from what goes before. How the case is with the desolation of the natural, or the deprivation of truth there, has already been told; but as the same subject is continued in 
what follows, it must be told again. The man who is born within the church, from earliest childhood learns from the Word and from the doctrinal things of the church what the truth of faith is, and also 
what the good of charity is. But when he grows up to manhood he begins either to confirm or to deny in himself the truths of faith that he has learned; for he then looks at these truths with his own 
sight, and thereby causes them either to be made his own or else to be rejected; for nothing can become one's own that is not acknowledged of one's own insight, that is, which the man does not know 
to be so from himself, and not from somebody else; and therefore the truths learned from childhood enter no further into the man's life than the first entrance, from which they can either be admitted 
more interiorly, or else be cast out.  [2] With those who are being regenerated, that is, who the Lord foresees will suffer themselves to be regenerated, these truths are greatly multiplied, for these 
persons are in the affection of knowing truths; but when they come nearer to the very act of regeneration, they are as it were deprived of these truths, for these are drawn inward, and then the man 
appears to be in desolation; nevertheless as regeneration goes on these truths are successively let back into the natural, and are there conjoined with good. But with those who are not being regenerated, 
that is, who the Lord foresees will not suffer themselves to be regenerated, truths are indeed usually multiplied, for these persons are in the affection of knowing such things for the sake of reputation, 
honor, and gain; yet when they advance in years and submit these truths to their own sight, they then either do not believe them, or they deny them, or they turn them into falsities; thus with 
them truths are not withdrawn inward, but are cast forth, although they still remain in the memory for the sake of ends in the world, though without life. This state also is called in the Word "desolation" 
or "vastation," but differs from the former state in the desolation of the former being apparent, while the desolation of this state is absolute; for in the former state man is not deprived of 
truths, while in this state he is entirely deprived of them. The desolation of the former state has been treated of in the internal sense in this chapter, and is still further treated of in the following 
one, and is what is signified by the "famine of seven years." [3] This same desolation is often treated of in other parts of the Word, as in Isaiah: </p>
<p>	Awake, awake, O Jerusalem, who hast drunk 
at the hand of Jehovah the cup of His anger; two things are befallen thee, who shall bemoan thee? Wasting and breaking, famine and the sword; how shall I comfort thee? Thy sons have fainted, they lie 
at the head of all the streets. Therefore hear, do this, thou afflicted and drunken one, but not with wine, behold I have taken out of thy hand the cup of trembling, the dregs of the cup of My wrath; 
thou shalt no more drink it again, but I will put it into the hand of them that make thee sad (Isa. 51:17-23); </p>
<p>in this passage is described the state of desolation in which is the man of the church who 
is becoming a church, or who is being regenerated. This desolation is called "wasting," "breaking," "famine," "sword," and also the "cup of the anger and wrath of Jehovah," and the "cup of trembling." 
The truths of which he is then deprived are the "sons who faint, and lie at the head of all the streets." That "sons" are truths may be seen above (n. 489, 491, 533, 1147, 2623, 2803, 2813, 3373), 
and that "streets" are where truths are (n. 2336); hence "to lie at the head of all the streets" means that truths appear to be dispersed. It is evident that this desolation is apparent, and that by 
it as by temptations regeneration is effected, for it is said that she "shall no more drink," but that "He will put the cup into the hand of them that make her sad." [4] In Ezekiel: </p>
<p>     Thus hath said 
the Lord Jehovih, Because they lay waste and swallow you up on every side, that ye be an inheritance unto the remains of the nations, therefore ye mountains of Israel hear the word of the Lord Jehovih: 
thus hath said the Lord Jehovih to the mountains and to the hills, to the watercourses and to the valleys, and to the desolate wastes and to the cities that are forsaken, which became a prey and 
derision to the remains of the nations that are round about; I have spoken in My zeal and in My wrath, because ye have borne the reproach of the nations. Surely the nations that are round about you, 
these shall bear their reproach; but ye mountains of Israel shall put forth your branch and yield your fruit to My people Israel. For behold I am with you, and I will have regard unto you, that ye may 
be tilled and sown; and I will multiply man upon you, the whole house of Israel, and the cities shall be inhabited, and the wastes builded. I will cause you to dwell according to your times of old, and 
will do better to you than at your beginnings (Ezek. 36:3-12); </p>
<p>here also the subject treated of is the desolation that precedes regeneration, the desolation being signified by the "desolate wastes," 
and the "cities that are forsaken, which became a prey and derision"; but regeneration being signified by "putting forth branch and yielding fruit," by "having regard unto them that they may be tilled 
and sown, that man may be multiplied, the cities inhabited, and the wastes built," and by "causing them to dwell according to their times of old," and "doing better to them than at their beginning." 
 [5] How the case is in regard to desolation is plain from those who are in desolation in the other life. They who are in desolation there are harassed by evil spirits and genii, who pour in persuasions 
of evil and falsity until they are almost overwhelmed, the result being that truths do not appear; but as the time of desolation draws to a close they are enlightened by light from heaven, and 
in this way the evil spirits and genii are driven away, everyone into his own hell, where they undergo punishments. These are the things signified by "the cities becoming a prey and derision to the remains 
of the nations that are round about," and by "the nations that are round about bearing their reproach"; and above in Isaiah by "the cup being put into the hand of them that make her sad"; and also 
in other passages in Isaiah by the "waster being laid waste" (Isa. 33:1). Also in Jeremiah: </p>
<p>     I will visit upon the wasters, and will make them everlasting desolations (Jer. 25:12). In Isaiah: </p>
<p>	Thy 
destroyers will hasten thy sons, and thy wasters shall go forth from thee. Lift up thine eyes round about and see; all gather together, they come to thee. For as to thy wastes and the land of thy 
destruction, thou shalt be too straitened for an inhabitant, they that swallow thee up shall be far away (Isa. 49:17-19); </p>
<p>[6] here again, and in this whole chapter, the subject treated of is the desolation 
of those who are being regenerated, and their regeneration and fruitfulness after desolation, and lastly the punishment of those who oppressed them (verse 26). In the same: </p>
<p>	Woe to thee that 
layeth waste when thou art not laid waste! When thou hast ceased to lay waste, thou shalt be laid waste (Isa. 33:1); </p>
<p>meaning that they who vastate are punished, as above. In the same: </p>
<p>	Let mine outcasts 
tarry in thee; Moab, be thou a covert to them before the waster; for the oppressor hath ceased, the wasting is ended (Isa. 16:4). Again: </p>
<p>	The day of Jehovah is near, it shall come as a wasting 
from Shaddai (Isa. 13:6); </p>
<p>"a wasting from Shaddai" denotes vastation in temptations; that God as to temptations was by the ancients called Shaddai, may be seen above (n. 1992, 3667, 4572). [7] Again: </p>
<p>	Then 
they shall not thirst; He shall lead them in wastes, He shall cause the waters to flow out of the rock for them; and He will cleave the rock that the waters flow out (Isa. 48:21); </p>
<p>speaking 
of the state after desolation. Again: </p>
<p>	Jehovah will comfort Zion, He will comfort all the wastes thereof, so as to make the wilderness thereof as Eden, and the solitude thereof as the garden of Jehovah; 
gladness and joy shall be found therein, confession and the voice of a song (Isa. 51:3). Where the subject treated of is the same, for as before said desolation is for the sake of the end that the 
man may be regenerated, that is, that after evils and falsities are separated, truths may be conjoined with goods, and goods with truths. The regenerate man as to good is what is compared to "Eden," 
and as to truths to the "garden of Jehovah." In David: </p>
<p>	Jehovah hath made me come up out of the pit of devastation, out of the mire of clay, and hath set my feet upon a rock (Ps. 40:2). [8] The vastation 
and desolation of the man of the church, or of the church in man, was represented by the captivity of the Jewish people in Babylon; and the raising up of the church by the return from that captivity, 
as occasionally described in Jeremiah, especially in chapter 32, verse 37 to the end; for desolation is captivity, the man then being kept as it were bound, and therefore by "those bound," "in 
prison," and "in the pit," are signified those who are in desolation (see n. 4728, 4744, 5037, 5038, 5085, 5096). [9] The state of desolation and vastation with those who are not being regenerated is 
also occasionally treated of in the Word. In this state are they who deny truths, or turn them into falsities: this is the state of the church toward its end, when there is no longer any faith or charity. 
Thus in Isaiah: </p>
<p>	I will make known to you what I will do to My vineyard, in removing the hedge thereof so that it shall be eaten up, in breaking through the fence thereof that it may be trodden 
down. I will then make it a desolation; it shall not be pruned nor hoed, that there may come up brier and shrub; nay, I will command the clouds that they rain no rain upon it (Isa. 5:5-6). In the same: </p>
<p>	Tell 
this people, Hearing hear ye, but understand not; and seeing see ye, but know not. Make the heart of this people fat, and make their ears heavy, and smear over their eyes; lest they see with 
their eyes, and hear with their ears, and their heart should understand, and they should be converted, and be healed. Then said I, Lord, how long? And he said, Until the cities be devastated that they 
be without inhabitant, and the houses that there be no man in them, and the land be reduced into a solitude; Jehovah will remove man. And the desert shall be multiplied in the midst of the land; scarcely 
a tenth part shall be in it any more, and yet it shall be banished (Isa. 6:9-13). [10] In the same: </p>
<p>     Remains shall return, the remains of Jacob, unto the mighty God; for a consummation is 
decreed, overflowing with righteousness; for a consummation and a decree shall the Lord Jehovih Zebaoth make in all the earth (Isa. 10:21-23).      Jehovah maketh the earth void, and maketh it empty, 
and will overturn the faces thereof. The earth shall be utterly void, the habitable earth shall mourn, shall be confounded, the world shall languish and be confounded, a curse shall devour the earth; 
the new wine shall mourn, the vine shall languish; that which is left in the city shall be a waste, the gate shall be smitten even to devastation; breaking, the earth is broken; breaking, the earth 
is broken in pieces; moving, the earth is moved; reeling, the earth reeleth like a drunkard (Isa. 24:1-23).      The paths are devastated, the wayfaring man ceaseth, the land mourneth and languisheth, 
Lebanon is ashamed and withered away, Sharon is become like a desert (Isa. 33:8-9).      I will make desolate and swallow up together, I will make waste mountains and hills, and dry up all their herb 
(Isa. 42:14-15). [11] In Jeremiah: </p>
<p>     I will give to the curse all the nations round about, and will make them a desolation, and a derision, and perpetual wastes; I will take from them the voice 
of joy and the voice of gladness, the voice of the bridegroom and the voice of the bride, the voice of the millstones and the light of the candle; that the whole land may be a desolation and a devastation. 
It shall come to pass when seventy years are fulfilled, that I will visit their iniquity upon the king of Babylon, and upon this nation, and upon the land of the Chaldees, and will make it everlasting 
desolations (Jer. 25:9-12 seq.).      Bozrah shall become a desolation, a reproach, a waste, and a curse; and all the cities thereof shall become perpetual wastes; Edom shall be a desolation, 
everyone that goeth by it shall be amazed, and shall hiss over all the plagues thereof (Jer. 49:13-18). In Ezekiel: </p>
<p>     Thus saith the Lord to the inhabitants of Jerusalem concerning the land of 
Israel, They shall eat their bread with solicitude, and drink their waters with amazement; that her land may be devastated from its fullness, because of the violence of all them that dwell therein; the 
cities that are inhabited shall be devastated, and the land shall be made desolate (Ezek. 12:19-20). [12] Again: </p>
<p>     When I shall make thee a desolate city, like the cities that are not inhabited; 
when I shall make the deep come up against thee, and many waters shall cover thee, and I shall make thee go down with them that descend into the pit, to the people of old time, and shall make thee 
to dwell in the earth of the lower things, for a desolation from eternity with them that go down into the pit (Ezek. 26:19-21); </p>
<p>speaking of Tyre. In Joel: </p>
<p>	A day of darkness and of thick darkness, a 
day of cloud and of obscurity; a fire devoureth before him and behind him a flame burneth; the land is as the garden of Eden before him, but behind him a wilderness of waste (Joel 2:2-3). In Zephaniah: </p>
<p>	The 
day of Jehovah is near, a day of wrath is this day, a day of distress and of cramping, a day of wasteness and devastation, a day of darkness and thick darkness, a day of cloud and shade; the 
whole land shall be devoured by the fire of the zeal of Jehovah, for I will make a consummation, yea, a speedy one, with all the inhabitants of the land (Zeph. 1:14-18). In Matthew: </p>
<p>	When ye shall 
see the abomination of desolation, foretold by Daniel the prophet, standing in the holy place, then let them that are in Judea flee into the mountains (Matt. 24:15-16; Mark 13:14; Dan. 9:27; 12:10-12). From 
these passages it is evident that desolation is the apparent deprivation of truth with those who are being regenerated, but is the absolute deprivation of it with those who are not being regenerated. </p>

<p align="center"><b>Elliott(1983-1999) 5376</b></p><p><b>5376.</b>
'For the famine became great in all the earth' means that, apart from there, desolation existed everywhere in the natural. This is clear from the meaning of 'famine' as a desolation, dealt with previously; 
and from the meaning of 'the earth' as the natural, also dealt with previously. The idea that everywhere apart from there is meant, that is to say, apart from within the known facts where the celestial 
of the spiritual was, follows from what has gone immediately before. What the desolation of the natural, or the deprivation of truth there, is like has been stated already; yet as this is dealt 
with further still in what follows, let the nature of it be mentioned once again. From earliest childhood the person born within the Church learns from the Word and from the teachings of the Church 
what the truth of faith is and what the good of charity is. But when he grows up he begins either to confirm for himself or else to refuse to accept the truths of faith he has learned; for now he looks 
at them for himself and in so doing either makes those truths his own or else casts them aside. For no truth can be made over to another person as his own unless he looks at it and accepts it for himself, 
that is, unless he knows for himself that it is true and does not rely simply on someone else. The truths therefore which he absorbed in childhood cannot enter any more deeply into his life than 
the outer gate, where they can either be let inside or else cast away outside. </p>
<p></p>
<p><b>[2]</b>
 With those who are being regenerated, that is, those who, as the Lord foresees, will allow themselves to be regenerated, 
those truths are multiplied exceedingly; for these people have an affection for knowing truths. But as they draw nearer to the point when their regeneration is actually carried out they are 
seemingly deprived of those truths. For those truths are withdrawn to a more interior position, and when this happens the person seems to experience desolation. Nevertheless those truths are returned 
in consecutive stages to the natural, where they are joined to good while the person is being regenerated. With those who are not being regenerated however, that is, those who, as the Lord foresees, will 
not allow themselves to be regenerated, truths are indeed usually multiplied, since these people possess an affection for knowing such truths for the sake of their own reputation, position, and gain. 
But as they advance in years and come to look at those truths for themselves, they either do not believe them, refuse to accept them, or else turn them into falsities. Thus in their case truths are 
not withdrawn to a more interior position but are cast away outside, though they remain in the memory to serve worldly ends, devoid of all life. In the Word this state is called desolation or vastation, 
though it differs from the state described first, in that the desolation belonging to that first state is only apparent, whereas the desolation belonging to the second state is total. For in the 
state described first the person is not deprived of truths, whereas in this latter state he is deprived of them altogether. The desolation belonging to the state described first is the subject in the 
internal sense of the present chapter and is again the subject in the next one; and that desolation is meant by a famine lasting for seven years. </p>
<p></p>
<p><b>[3]</b>
 This kind of desolation is referred to many times 
elsewhere in the Word, as in Isaiah, </p>
<blockquote>
Stir, stir, O Jerusalem, you who have drunk from the hand of Jehovah the cup of His anger. Two things have come upon you; who condoles with you? Vastation and 
ruination, famine and sword, who is there that I may comfort you? Your sons fainted, they lay at the head of every street. Therefore listen, do this, O afflicted one, and drunk though not from wine. 
Behold, I have taken out of your hand the cup of trepidation, the dregs of the cup of My wrath; you shall no longer drink it. But I will put it in the hand of those who oppress you. <a href="http://bible.gospelcom.net/cgi-bin/bible?passage=Isa%2051:17-end&amp;version=ESV&amp;interface=print&amp;showfn=yes&amp;showxref">Isa 51:17-end</a>. 
</blockquote>
<p>This 
is a description of the state of desolation experienced by a member of the Church who is becoming a Church, that is, who is being regenerated. That desolation is called 'vastation, ruination, famine, 
and sword', also 'the cup of Jehovah's anger and wrath', and 'the cup of trepidation'. The truths that a person is deprived of at such times are 'the sons who faint and lie at the head of every 
street'. For 'sons' are truths, see <a href="489.htm">489</a>, <a href="491.htm">491</a>, <a href="533.htm">533</a>, <a href="1147.htm">1147</a>, <a href="2623.htm">2623</a>, <a href="2803.htm">2803</a>, <a href="2813.htm">2813</a>, <a href="3373.htm">3373</a>, 'street' the place where the truths are, <a href="2336.htm">2336</a>; consequently 'lying at the head of every street' means that truths appear 
to exist in a dispersed condition. One can see that the desolation is only an apparent one and that regeneration is effected by means of it, as it also is by means of temptations; for it says that 
[Jerusalem] will no longer drink the cup but that [Jehovah] will put it in the hand of those who oppress her. </p>
<p></p>
<p><b>[4]</b>
 In Ezekiel, </p>
<blockquote>
Thus said the Lord Jehovih, Because they devastated you and swallowed 
you up from all around, so that you are an inheritance for the rest of the nations, therefore, O mountains of Israel, hear the word of the Lord Jehovih. Thus said the Lord Jehovih to the mountains and 
hills, the streams and valleys, and the desolate wastes, and the deserted cities, which became plunder and a derision to the rest of the nations all around: I have spoken in My zeal and in My wrath, 
because you have endured the shame of the nations. Surely the nations that are around you will bear their own shame. But you, O mountains of Israel, will shoot forth<A name="fntext1"></a><A href="#fn1"><sup>a</sup></a> your branches and yield your fruit 
to My people Israel. For behold, I am with you, and will turn to you, so that you are tilled and sown. Also I will multiply man (homo) upon you, the entire house of Israel; and the cities will be 
inhabited, and the waste places will be built. I will resettle you<A name="fntext2"></a><A href="#fn2"><sup>b</sup></a> to be as you were in former times and I will do more good than in your early days. <a href="http://bible.gospelcom.net/cgi-bin/bible?passage=Ezek%2036:3-11&amp;version=ESV&amp;interface=print&amp;showfn=yes&amp;showxref">Ezek 36:3-11</a>. 
</blockquote>
<p>This too refers to the desolation 
that comes just before regeneration. That desolation is meant by 'the desolate wastes and the deserted cities, which became plunder and a derision', while such regeneration is meant by 'shooting forth 
a branch and yielding fruit', 'turning to them, so that they are tilled and sown', 'so that man is multiplied, cities inhabited, and waste places built', and 'resettling them to be as they were in 
former times, and doing more good to them than in their early days'. </p>
<p></p>
<p><b>[5]</b>
 What desolation is like is evident from those experiencing it in the next life. Those who experience desolation there are 
harried by evil spirits and genii; for these pour in evil desires and false ideas which are so strong that those people are almost submerged in them. As a consequence truths are not visible; but then 
as the time of desolation comes to an end those truths are lit up by light received from heaven, and the evil spirits and genii are driven away, each to his own hell, where they undergo punishments. Those 
punishments are what is meant by 'cities which became plunder and a derision to the rest of the nations all around' and by 'the nations that are around will bear their own shame'. Such punishments 
are also meant by 'the cup will be put in the hand of those who oppress you', in the passage quoted above from Isaiah, as well as in another place in the same prophet, where it says that 'the one who 
lays waste will be laid waste', <a href="http://bible.gospelcom.net/cgi-bin/bible?passage=Isa%2033:1&amp;version=ESV&amp;interface=print&amp;showfn=yes&amp;showxref">Isa 33:1</a>. And in Jeremiah, </p>
<blockquote>
I will visit those who lay waste, and I will consign them to everlasting desolations. <a href="http://bible.gospelcom.net/cgi-bin/bible?passage=Jer%2025:12&amp;version=ESV&amp;interface=print&amp;showfn=yes&amp;showxref">Jer 25:12</a>. 
</blockquote>
<p>In Isaiah, </p>
<blockquote>
Your destroyers will 
hasten your sons, and those who lay you waste will go away from you. Lift up your eyes round about and see; they all gather together, they come to you. Because of your waste places and your desolate 
places, and the land of your destruction, you will be too restricted for the inhabitants; those who swallow you up will have gone far away. <a href="http://bible.gospelcom.net/cgi-bin/bible?passage=Isa%2049:17-19&amp;version=ESV&amp;interface=print&amp;showfn=yes&amp;showxref">Isa 49:17-19</a>. 
</blockquote>
<p></p>
<p><b>[6]</b>
 These verses too, indeed that whole chapter 
in Isaiah, refer to the desolation suffered by those who are being regenerated, and to the regeneration and fruitfulness that follow desolation, verse 26 referring at length to the punishment of 
those who have been the oppressors. In the same prophet,  </p>
<blockquote>
Woe to you who lay waste, though you have not been laid waste; when you finish laying waste, you will be laid waste. <a href="http://bible.gospelcom.net/cgi-bin/bible?passage=Isa%2033:1&amp;version=ESV&amp;interface=print&amp;showfn=yes&amp;showxref">Isa 33:1</a>. 
</blockquote>
<p>This refers 
to the punishment of those who lay waste, as above. In the same prophet, </p>
<blockquote>
Let My outcasts dwell together in you; O Moab, be a refuge to them in the presence of the one who lays waste. For the oppressor 
has ceased, vastation has come to an end. <a href="http://bible.gospelcom.net/cgi-bin/bible?passage=Isa%2016:4&amp;version=ESV&amp;interface=print&amp;showfn=yes&amp;showxref">Isa 16:4</a>. 
</blockquote>
<p>In the same prophet, </p>
<blockquote>
The day of Jehovah is near; like vastation from Shaddai it will come. <a href="http://bible.gospelcom.net/cgi-bin/bible?passage=Isa%2013:6&amp;version=ESV&amp;interface=print&amp;showfn=yes&amp;showxref">Isa 13:6</a>. 
</blockquote>
<p>'Vastation from Shaddai' stands 
for vastation in temptations. For in ancient times God, when involved in temptations, was called Shaddai, see <a href="1992.htm">1992</a>, <a href="3667.htm">3667</a>, <a href="4572.htm">4572</a>. </p>
<p></p>
<p><b>[7]</b>
 In the same prophet, </p>
<blockquote>
At that time they will not thirst; in 
the waste places He will lead them; He will make water flow for them from the rock, and He will cleave the rock so that water flows out. <a href="http://bible.gospelcom.net/cgi-bin/bible?passage=Isa%2048:11&amp;version=ESV&amp;interface=print&amp;showfn=yes&amp;showxref">Isa 48:11</a>. 
</blockquote>
<p>This has to do with the state that follows desolation. 
In the same prophet, </p>
<blockquote>
Jehovah will comfort Zion, He will comfort all her waste places, so much so that He will make her wilderness like Eden and her desert like the garden of Jehovah. Gladness 
and joy will be found in her, confession and the voice of song. <a href="http://bible.gospelcom.net/cgi-bin/bible?passage=Isa%2051:3&amp;version=ESV&amp;interface=print&amp;showfn=yes&amp;showxref">Isa 51:3</a>. 
</blockquote>
<p>Here the meaning is similar, for as stated above, desolation occurs to the end that a person may be regenerated, that 
is, to the end that evils and falsities may first be separated from him and then truths may be joined to forms of good, and forms of good to truths. The regenerate person so far as good is concerned is 
the one who is being compared to Eden, and so far as truth is concerned to the garden of Jehovah. In David, </p>
<blockquote>
Jehovah caused me to come up out of the pit of devastation, out of the miry clay, and He 
set my feet upon a rock. <a href="http://bible.gospelcom.net/cgi-bin/bible?passage=Ps%2040:2&amp;version=ESV&amp;interface=print&amp;showfn=yes&amp;showxref">Ps 40:2</a>.

<p><b>[8]</b>
 The vastation and desolation suffered by a member of the Church, or by the Church residing with him, was represented by the captivity of the Jewish people in 
Babel, while the resurgence of the Church was represented by their return from that captivity, dealt with in various places in Jeremiah, especially in Chapter 32:37-end. Desolation is a captivity, for 
at that time a person is held so to speak in bonds, for which reason also 'the bound', 'those in prison', or 'those in the pit' mean those experiencing desolation, see <a href="4728.htm">4728</a>, <a href="4744.htm">4744</a>, <a href="5037.htm">5037</a>, <a href="5038.htm">5038</a>, <a href="5085.htm">5085</a>, <a href="5096.htm">5096</a>. </p>

 Reference to a state of desolation and vastation among those who are not being regenerated is also made in various places in the Word. It is a state passed through by those who utterly deny 
truths or else turn them into falsities; it is the state which the Church passes through around the time of its end, when there is no faith and no charity any longer. In Isaiah, </p>
<p>I will cause you 
to know what I am about to do to My vineyard, by taking away its hedge, so that it is destroyed,<A name="fntext3"></a><A href="#fn3"><sup>c</sup></a> and by breaking down its wall, so that it is trodden down. I will after that make it a desolation; 
it will not be pruned or heed, so that bramble and shrub will come up there; indeed I will command the clouds to rain no rain on it. Isa. 5:5-7. </p>
<p>In the same prophet, </p>
<p>Say to this people, Hearing, 
hear - but do not understand; and seeing, see - but do not comprehend. Make the heart of this people fat and their ears heavy, and plaster over their eyes, lest they see with their eyes and hear with 
their ears, and their heart understands, and they turn again and be healed. Then I said, How long, O Lord? And He said, Until cities will have been devastated, so that they are without inhabitant, and 
houses, so that there is no one in them, and the land is reduced to a lonely place; He will remove man. And the wilderness will be multiplied in the midst of the land. Scarcely any longer will there 
be a tenth part in it; it will be however an uprooting. Isa. 6:9-end. </p>

<p><b>[10]</b>
 In the same prophet, </p>
<p>A remnant will return, the remnant of Jacob, to the God of power. For the close has been determined, 
overflowing with righteousness; for the Lord Jehovih Zebaoth is bringing the whole earth to its close and to its determined end. Isa. 10:21-23. </p>
<p>In the same prophet, </p>
<p>Jehovah is emptying the 
earth and making it void, and He will overturn the face of it. The earth will be utterly emptied. The inhabited earth will mourn, it will be turned upside down. The world will languish and will be turned 
upside down. A curse will devour the earth. The new wine will mourn, the vine will languish. What is left in the city will be a waste; the gate will be smashed to devastation. The earth has been utterly 
broken, the earth has been utterly split open, the earth has been made to quake violently; the earth staggers altogether like a drunken man. Isa. 24:4-end. </p>
<p>In the same prophet, </p>
<p>The highways 
have been devastated, the wayfarer has ceased. The earth mourns, it languishes. Lebanon has become ashamed, it has withered away; Sharon has become like a wilderness. Isa. 33:8, <a href="9.htm">9</a>. </p>

the voice of the bride, the sound of the mills, and the light of the lamp, so that the whole land will be a desolation and devastation. It will happen when seventy years have been fulfilled, that I will

quid serum fidei, etiam quid bonum charitatis; sed cum adolescit aetate,  incipit ille vera fidei quae didicerat, vel apud se confirmare, vel apud se negare, proprio enim visu tunc illa intuetur,

<p>describitur hic status desolationis in quo homo Ecclesiae qui fit Ecclesia, seu qui regeneratur; desolatio illa vocatur `vastitas, confractio, fames, gladius', 
tum `calix irae et excandescentiae Jehovae, calix trepidationis'; vera quibus tunc privatur, sunt `filii qui deficiunt et jacent in capite omnium platearum'; quod `filii' sint vera, videatur n. 489, 491, 
533, 1147, 2623, 2803, 2813, 3373; `plateae' quod sint ,ubi vera, n. 2336; inde `jacere in capite omnium platearum' est {7} quod vera appareant dispersa; quod desolatio apparens sit, et per illam, 
sicut per tentationes, regeneratio, patet, nam dicitur quod `non amplius bibet' sed quod `ponet calicem in manu contristantium (x)illorum: [4] apud Ezechielem, Sic dixit Dominus Jehovih, Propterea quod 
devastant et absorbent vos a circuitu, ut sitis vos hereditas reliquiis gentium,... ideo montes Israelis, audite verbum Domini Jehovih; sic dixit Dominus Jehovih montibus et collibus, rivis et vallibus, 
et vastitatibus desolatis, et urbibus desertis, quae factae sunt in praedam, et in subsannationem reliquiis gentium quae in circuitu; ... Ego in zelo Meo, et in excandescentia Mea locutus sum, 
propter ignominiam gentium tulistis,... si non gentes quae vobis a circuitu, hae ignominiam suam portabunt; vos autem montes Israelis, dabitis ramum vestrum, et fructum vestrum feretis populo Meo Israeli; 
nam... ecce Ego apud vos, et respiciam ad vos, ut excolamini et conseramini; tum multiplicabo super vobis hominem, universam domum Israelis; et habitabuntur urbes, et vastitates aedificabuntur;... 
habitare faciam vos juxta antiquitates vestras, et bonum faciam prae initiis vestris, xxxvi [3,] 4-12; </p>
<p>hic quoque agitur de desolatione quae praecedit regenerationem; desolatio significatur per `vastitates 
desolatas et urbes desertas, quae factae in praedam et in subsannationem', at regeneratio per `dare ramum et ferre fructum, respicere ad illos ut excolantur et conserantur, ut multiplicetur homo, 
habitentur urbes, et aedificentur vastitates', perque `habitare facere juxta antiquitates, et bonum facere prae initiis'; [5] qualiter se habet cum desolatione, ex illis qui in desolatione sunt in 
altera vita, patet; qui in desolatione sunt ibi, a malis spiritibus et geniis vexantur, infundunt enim hi persuasiones mali et falsi usque paene ut inundentur; inde vera non apparent, at sicut tempus 
desolationis finitur, ita illustrantur a luce e caelo, (c)ac ita mali spiritus et genii abiguntur quisque in infernum suum, ubi luunt poenas; haec sunt quae significantur per `quod urbes factae in praedam 
et in subsannationem reliquiis gentium quae in circuitu', et quod gentes quae a circuitu ignominiam suam portabunt'; et supra apud Esaiam per quod `calix ponetur in manu contristantium', et quoque 
alibi {8} apud Esaiam, quod `vastans vastabitur', xxxiii 1 {9}: et apud Jeremiam, Visitabo super vastatores {10}, et ponam eos in desolationes saeculi, xxv 12 {11}: </p>
<p>apud Esaiam, Festinabunt filios 
tuos destructores tui, et vastatores tui a te abibunt; tolle circumcirca oculos tuos, et vide, omnes congregantur, veniunt tibi,... nam quod ad vastationes tuas et desolationes tuas, et terram destructionis 
tuae, angustior eris quam {12} pro habitatore, procul aberunt absorptores tui, xlix 17-19; </p>
<p>[6] ibi etiam et in toto illo capite agitur de desolatione eorum qui regenerantur, deque regeneratione 
et fructificatione post desolationem,et tandem de punitione illorum qui oppresserunt, vers. (t)26 ibi: apud eundem, Vae vastanti cum [non] vastatus,... quando absolveris vastare, vastaberis, xxxiii 
1; </p>
<p>ibi quod puniantur qui vastant {13}, ut supra: apud eundem,  Commorentur in te expulsi Mei; Moabe, esto latibulum illis coram vastatore, nam cessavit oppressor, finita est vastatio, xvi 13 [A.V.4]: </p>
<p>apud 
eundem, Propinquus est dies Jehovae, sicut vastatio a Shaddai veniet, xiii 6; </p>
<p>`vastatio a Shaddai' pro vastatione in tentationibus; quod Deus quoad tentationes antiquis (t) dictus sit Shaddai, 
videatur n. 1992, 3667, 4572: [7] apud eundem, Tunc non sitient, in vastitatibus ducet eos, aquas e petra effluere faciet illis, et findet petram ut effluant aquae, xlviii 21; </p>
<p>de statu post 
desolationem: apud eundem, Consolabitur Jehovah Zionem, consolabitur omnes vastitates ejus, adeo ut ponat desertum ejus sicut Eden, et solitudinem ejus  sicut hortum Jehovae; laetitia et gaudium invenietur 
in ea, confessio et vox cantus, li 3; </p>
<p>similiter, nam ut supra dictum, desolatio {14} est propter finem ut homo regeneretur {15}, hoc est, ut separatis malis et falsis {16} conjungantur vera bonis, 
et bona veris; homo regeneratus quoad bonum est qui comparatur Edeni, et quoad vera horto Jehovae: (m)apud Davidem, Jehovah fecit ascendere me e fovea devastationis, e caeno luti, et constituit 
super petra pedes meos, Ps. xl 3 [A. V. 2].(n) [8] Vastatio ac desolatio hominis Ecclesiae seu Ecclesiae apud hominem, repraesentata fuit per captivitatem populi Judaici in Babele, et Ecclesiae exsuscitatio 
per reditionem ex captivitate illa, de qua apud Jeremiam passim, cumprimis xxxii 37 ad fin.; desolatio enim est captivitas, tunc enim tenetur homo quasi vinctus, quapropter etiam per vinctos, 
in carcere, {17} in fovea, significantur illi qui in desolatione sunt, videatur n. 4728, 4744, 5037, 5038, 5085, 5096.  [9] De statu desolationis et vastationis apud illos qui non regenerantur, etiam 
passim agitur in Verbo, in hoc statu sunt qui vera prorsus negant, vel in falsa vertunt; hic status est Ecclesiae circa finem, cum amplius non fides nec charitas: apud Esaiam, (m)Notum faciam vobis id 
quod Ego facturus vineae Meae, removendo sepem ejus, ut sit ad depascendum, perrumpendo maceriem ejus, ut sit in conculcationem, ponam deinde in desolationem, non putabitur, nec {18} sarrietur, ut ascendat 
vepris et virgultum, immo nubibus praecipiam ut non faciant pluere super illam pluviam, v 5-7: (n) (s)apud eundem, Dic populo huic, Audite audiendo, sed non intelligite, et videte videndo, sed 
non cognoscite; impingua cor populi hujus, et aures ejus aggrava, et oculos ejus obline, ne forte videat oculis suis, et auribus suis audiat, et cor ejus intelligat, et convertatur, ut sanetur sibi; 
tum dixi, Quousque Domine? Qui dixit, Usque dum devastabuntur urbes, ut sint sine habitatore, et domus ut non sit in iis (homo), et terra redigatur in solitudinem, removebit hominem; et multiplicabitur 
deserta in medio terrae, vix amplius in ea pars decima, et tamen erit ad exterminandum, vi 9 ad fin.(s): </p>
<p>[10] apud eundem, Reliquiae revertentur, reliquiae Jacobi ad Deum potentem,... nam consummatio 
definita, inundata justitia, nam consummationem et definitionem Dominus Jehovih Zebaoth faciens in tota terra, x 21-23: </p>
<p>apud eundem, Jehovah evacuans terram, et exinaniens illam, et evertet facies 
ejus;... evacuando evacuabitur terra,... lugebit, confundetur terra habitabilis, languescet et confundetur orbis, maledictio comedet terram,... lugebit mustum, languescet vitis,... reliquum in urbe 
vastitas, usque ad devastationem confundetur porta,... confringendo confracta est terra, disrumpendo disrupta est terra,  commovendo commota est terra, titubando titubat terra sicut ebrius, xxiv 1 
ad fin.: </p>
<p>apud eundem, Devastatae sunt semitae, cessavit transiens viam,... luget, languescit terra; erubuit Libanus, emarcuit, factus est Sharon sicut desertum, xxxiii 8,9: </p>
<p>apud eundem, Desolabo et 
absorbebo simul, vastabo montes et colles, et omnem herbam eorum arefaciam, xlii 14, 15: </p>
<p>[11] apud Jeremiam, Devotioni dabo omnes gentes circumcirca, et ponam eas in desolationem, et in derisionem, 
et in vastitates saeculi, et abrogabo ex illis vocem gaudii, et vocem laetitiae, vocem sponsi et vocem sponsae, vocem molarum et lucem lucernae, ut sit tota terra in desolationem et devastationem:... 
fiet {19} cum impleti fuerint septuaginta anni, visitabo super regem Babelis, et super gentem hanc... iniquitatem eorum, et super terram Chaldaeorum, et ponam eum in desolationes saeculi, xxv 9-12 seq.: </p>
<p>apud 
eundem, In desolationem, in opprobrium, in vastationem, et in maledictionem, futura est Bozrah, et omnes urbes ejus futurae in  vastitates saeculi. {20} Erit Edomus in desolationem, omnis 
qui transibit praeter eam, obstupescet, et sibilabit super omnibus plagis ejus, xlix 13-18: </p>
<p>apud Ezechielem, Sic dixit Dominus habitatoribus Hierosolymae super terra  Israelis, Panem suum cum sollicitudine 
comedent, et aquas suas cum stupore bibent, ut devastetur terra ejus a plenitudine sua, propter violentiam omnium habitatorum in illa, urbes habitatae devastabuntur, et terra desolabitur, iii 
19, 20: </p>
<p>[12] apud eundem, Cum dedero te urbem desolatam, sicut urbes quae non habitantur, cum ascendere fecero contra te abyssum, obtexerint te aquae multae, et fecero descendere te cum descendentibus 
foveam, ad populum saeculi, et habitare fecero te in terra inferiorum, in desolationem ab aeterno  cum descendentibus foveam, xxvi 18-22; </p>
<p>ubi de Tyro: apud Joelem, Dies tenebrarum et caliginis, dies 
nubis et obscuritatis,... ante eum comedit ignis, et post eum inflammat flamma, sicut hortus Eden terra ante eum, sed post eum desertum vastitatis, ii 2, 3: </p>
<p>apud Zephaniam, Propinquus est dies Jehovae,... 
dies excandescentiae dies hic, dies angustiae et coarctationis, dies vastitatis et devastationis, dies tenebrarum et caliginis, dies nubis et obnubilationis,... igne zeli Jehovae comedetur 
tota terra, quia consummationem et quidem festinatam faciam cum omnibus habitatoribus terrae, i 14 ad fin.: </p>
<p>apud Matthaeum, Cum videritis abominationem desolationis praedictam a Daniele propheta, stantem 
in loco sancto, tunc qui in Judaea fugiant in montes, xxiv (x)15, Marc. xiii 14, Dan. ix 27, xii 10-12. Ex his constat quod `desolatio' sit privatio veri apparens apud illos qui regenerantur, at 
absoluta apud illos qui non regenerantur. </p>
