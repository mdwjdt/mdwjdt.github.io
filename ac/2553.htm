<h3 align="center" class="ired">属天的奥秘 第2553节</h3>
<h4 align="center"></h4><p><strong>2553.</strong>“因为我说，这地方的人总不惧怕神”表源于这种直觉的思维：他们在当时所处的状态下不会尊重属灵的真理。这从“惧怕神”和“地方”的含义清楚可知，“惧怕神”是指对神性，或属灵真理的尊重；“地方”是指状态（参看<a href="1273.htm">1273</a>-<a href="1275.htm">1275</a>，<a href="1377.htm">1377</a>节）。其中的情形是这样：纯粹属灵、属天的教义，即神性，人是无法理解的。因为它无限超越人的理解力，因而远在他的信仰范围之外。人所拥有的一切思维都终止于他的感官所体验的属世之物。任何事物若不凭借并照着这些属世之物来说，就不被理解，而是会消失，就像把眼光投向一望无际的海洋或宇宙。因此，若以其它方式在人面前阐述教义，他根本就不接受它们，因而也就谈不上尊重。这一点可从圣言的每个细节非常清楚地看出来，由于同样的原因，那里的纯神性事物就是以属世的方式，甚至以感官的方式来阐述的。如耶和华有耳、眼和脸，并且拥有像人那样的情感，如愤怒等。<br />主降世之时，这种情形尤为突出。那时，人们根本不知道何为属天之物和属灵之物，甚至不知道还有内在事物。纯世俗、因而外在事物完全占据了他们的心思意念。使徒们自己也是这样，他们以为主的国和世上的国一样。为此，他们要求这一个坐在祂的右手边，那一个坐在祂的左手边，并且有很长一段时间，他们以为自己会坐在十二个宝座上审判以色列的十二个支派；殊不知，在来世，他们无权审判任何人的哪怕最小的事（<a href="2129.htm">2129</a>节末尾）。祂探究人类的这种状态就是主起初思想是否应就信之教义请教理性的原因。这种想法出于祂的爱，这爱就是，要照顾到所有人的救赎，并且圣言不可以灭亡。</p>

Because I said, Surely there is no fear of God in this place. That this signifies the thought thence derived: that they would have no respect for spiritual truth in that state in which they were, is 
evident from the signification of the expression "fear of God," as being respect for Divine or spiritual truth; and from the signification of "place," as being state (see n. 1273-1275, 1377). The case 
herein is this: Man cannot apprehend any doctrine that is purely spiritual and celestial, that is, Divine, because it infinitely transcends his apprehension, and thus also his belief. All man's thoughts 
are terminated in the natural things which are connected with his senses. Whatever is not said from and according to these natural things is not comprehended, but perishes, like sight that has no 
bound in some ocean or universe; and therefore if doctrinal matters were set forth before a man in any other manner, they would not be at all received, and thus no respect would be entertained for them; 
as may be sufficiently evident from everything in the Word, where for this very reason purely Divine things themselves are set forth naturally, nay, sensuously; as that Jehovah has ears, eyes, and 
a face; and that He has feelings like a man, such as anger, and so forth. [2] This need was still greater at the time when the Lord came into the world, for then men did not know even what the celestial 
and the spiritual was, nor even that there was anything internal. Things merely earthly and worldly, and thus external, had full possession of their minds, as was the case with the apostles themselves, 
who imagined that the Lord's kingdom would be like a kingdom of this world, and therefore asked that one might sit on His right hand and another on His left, and who long thought that they should 
sit upon twelve thrones to judge the twelve tribes of Israel; not as yet being aware that in the other life they would not have ability to judge even the smallest thing of one man (n. 2129, at the end). 
His looking into this state of the human race was the reason of the Lord's thinking at first whether the rational was to be consulted in the doctrine of faith; and this from His love, which was that 
the salvation of all might be provided for, and that the Word might not perish. </p>

'Because I said, Surely there is no fear of God in this place' means the thought derived from this that men would have no respect for spiritual truth in that state in which they were then. This is clear 
from the meaning of 'the fear of God' as respect for Divine, or spiritual, truth, and from the meaning of 'a place' as a state, dealt with in <a href="1273.htm">1273</a>-<a href="1275.htm">1275</a>, <a href="1377.htm">1377</a>. Involved here is the fact that man is 
unable to grasp any doctrine which is purely spiritual and celestial, that which is Divine, because it goes infinitely above and beyond his grasp of things, and so also above the range of his belief. 
All thoughts which man has are confined within natural things experienced by his senses, and anything that is said which does not draw on and does not fit in with those natural things is not comprehended 
but perishes, like sight gazing into some ocean or universe without any object there on which it may focus. Consequently if matters of doctrine were presented to man in any other manner, they would 
not be received at all, and so he would have no respect for them. This may become quite clear from each detail in the Word. There purely Divine things are for the same reason presented as natural, 
indeed sensory ones, such as that Jehovah has ears, eyes, and a face, has affections as man does, anger, and many more things. </p>

 This was still more the case with men when the Lord came into the 
world. At that time they did not even have any knowledge of what the celestial or the spiritual was, nor even of anything internal. Wholly earthly and worldly, and thus external things possessed every 
thought in their minds, even the minds of the apostles themselves who supposed that the Lord's kingdom would be like a worldly kingdom. For that reason these asked to sit one on His right hand and the 
other on the left and for a long while imagined they were going to sit on twelve thrones and to judge the twelve tribes of Israel, still unaware of the fact that in the next life they would not have 
the power to judge even the least detail of any one individual's affairs, <a href="2129.htm">2129</a> (end). His looking into this state of the human race was the reason why the Lord at first thought about whether the rational 
ought to be consulted in the doctrine of faith. In this He was moved by a love which was that the salvation of all might be taken care of and that the Word should not perish. </p>

`Quia dixi, Verum tamen nullus timor Dei in loco hoc': quod significet cogitationem inde quod nullum respectum haberent veri spiritualis in eo statu in quo sunt, constat ex significatione `timoris Dei' 
quod sit respectus veri Divini (o)seu spiritualis; et a significatione `loci' quod sit status, de qua n. 1273, 1274, 1275, 1377. Ipsa res ita se habet: homo non capere potest aliquod doctrinale pure 
spirituale et caeleste, hoc est, Divinum, quia transcendit infinite captum ejus, ita quoque fidem; omnes cogitationes hominis terminantur in naturalibus quae sunt ejus sensualium; quicquid non ex his 
et secundum haec dicitur, hoc non comprehenditur, sed perit, sicut visus interminatus in quodam oceano aut universo; quare si doctrinalia coram homine exponerentur aliter, prorsus non reciperentur, 
ita nullus respectus pro (c)illis haberetur; quod satis constare potest ex singulis in Verbo; ibi ipsa pure Divina ob eandem causam naturaliter, immo sensualiter, exponuntur, ut quod Jehovae sint aures, 
sint oculi, sint facies, sint affectiones sicut homini, sit ira, et plura: [2] (s)hoc adhuc magis eo tempore cum Dominus venit in mundum; tunc ne quidem sciebant quid caeleste et spirituale, ne quidem 
quod internum; solum terrestria et mundana, et sic externa: mentis eorum omnia tenebant, sicut ipsorum apostolorum, qui regnum Domini sicut regnum mundi fore autumabant, et ideo petierunt ut unus 
a dextris, alter a sinistris, sederet, et diu putarunt quod super duodecim thronis sederent judicaturi duodecim tribus Israelis, non adhuc scientes quod in altera vita (o)illi ne quidem minimum unius 
hominis possent judicare, n. 2129 ad fin.: intuitio in hunc statum (t)generis humani fuit causa quod a Domino primum cogitatum sit num rationale esset consulendum in doctrina fidei, et hoc ex amore qui 
fuit ut consuleretur omnium saluti et quod Verbum non periret.' </p>
