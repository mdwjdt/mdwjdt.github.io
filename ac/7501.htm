<h3 align="center" class="ired">属天的奥秘 第7501节</h3>
<h4 align="center"></h4><p><strong>7501.</strong>“你若不肯容他们去，仍旧强留他们”表如果他们继续固执地侵扰他们。这从“不肯”和“强留”的含义清楚可知：“不肯”是指固执的，因此，“不肯容去”是指固执地拒绝离开；“强留”是指继续侵扰；因为那些被侵扰的人被那些侵扰他们的恶灵扣留。至于那些被侵扰的人被恶灵扣留，情况是这样：当恶灵攻击某人时，他们知道如何进入与他的欲望密不可分的快乐，以及吸引其基本思维方式的观念，因而他所爱的对象中。只要进入，他们就会像扣留囚犯一样扣留他们正侵扰的那个人；若没有主的神性帮助，无论他如何努力，都无法挣脱。因为他的爱和他们进入他的爱之快乐会把他与他们绑在一起。这就是恶灵和魔鬼在来世所用的伎俩。这种事在这个世界上也是看得到的；当一个人进入别人的爱所固有的快乐时，他就迷住此人，还引导他。</p>

For if thou refuse to let them go, and if thou still withhold them. That this signifies if they should still be determined to infest, is evident from the signification of "refusing," as being to be determined; 
hence "to refuse to let go" denotes to be determined not to leave; and from the signification of "withholding," as being still to infest; for they who are infested are withheld by the evil 
spirits who infest. In regard to those who are infested being withheld by evil spirits, the case is this. When evil spirits assault anyone, they know how to instill themselves into the delights that belong 
to his cupidities, and also into the pleasant feelings connected with his principles, thus into all things of his love; and so long as they are engaged in this instilling they withhold the man whom 
they are infesting as if bound, nor can he be loosed, however he struggles, except with the Lord's Divine aid, for love and instilling into the delight of the love conjoin. Such is the art employed 
by evil spirits and genii in the other life. The same thing is seen in this world; for he who instills himself into another's delight which is of his love, holds him bound and also leads him. </p>

<p align="center"><b>Elliott(1983-1999) 7501</b></p><p><b>7501.</b>
'For if you refuse to send them away and you still hold them back' means if they obstinately continued to molest them. This is clear from the meaning of 'refusing' as behaving obstinately, and therefore 
'refusing to send away' is obstinately refusing to leave; and from the meaning of 'holding back' as continuing to molest, for those who are molested are held back by the evil spirits who molest them. 
The situation when this happens - when those who are molested by evil spirits are held back by them - is as follows: When evil spirits attack someone they know how to worm their way into the delights 
bound up with his desires, and also into the ideas attractive to his basic way of thinking, thus into the objects of his love. And for as long as they have wormed their way in like this they hold 
back the one they molest like a captive; and he cannot break free, however hard he tries, without Divine help from the Lord. For his love and their worming their way into the delights intrinsic to his 
love binds him to them. Such is the nature of this art that is practised by evil spirits and genii in the next life. What it is like is also evident from something similar in the world; when one person 
worms his way into the delights intrinsic to another person's love he captivates him and also leads him on. </p>

</p><b>7501.</b>
`Quia si renuis dimittere, et adhuc tu detines illos': quod significet si adhuc obstinarent se ad infestandum, constat ex significatione `renuere' quod sit obstinare; inde `renuere dimittere' est obstinare 
se ad non relinquendum; et ex significatione `detinere' quod sit adhuc infestare; nam qui infestantur, a spiritibus malis qui infestant detinentur.  Cum hoc, quod a spiritibus malis detineantur 
illi qui infestantur, ita se habet: spiritus mali cum aggrediuntur aliquem, sciunt insinuare se in ejus jucunda quae cupiditatum, et quoque in ejus amoena quae {1} principiorum, ita in illa quae ejus 
amoris sunt; et quamdiu in tali insinuatione sunt, detinent illum quem infestant, sicut vinctum, non {2} potest exsolvi, utcumque allaborat, nisi ex Divina ope Domini, nam amor et insinuatio in jucundum 
amoris conjungit; tali arte utuntur mali spiritus et genii in altera vita {3}; (m)hoc quoque patet a simili {4} in mundo, qui insinuat se in alterius jucundum quod amoris ejus, is tenet illum vinctum 
et quoque ducit.(n) 	@1 i sunt$ 	@2 i enim$ 	@3 i, qua vinctos tenent, quos infestant$ 	@4 i quod fit$ </p>
