<h4 align="center"></h4><p><strong>3548.</strong>“雅各到他父亲那里说，我的父亲！他说，我在这里。我儿，你是谁”表由这真理在场所产生的直觉状态。这从以撒和雅各的代表，以及“说”的含义清楚可知：以撒，就是此处的“父亲”；雅各就是此处的“儿子”，这在前面已经数次说明；“说”是指发觉，这在前面也早已说明。从这些和其余的话明显可知，其中的含义是指由雅各所代表的真理在场产生的直觉状态。此处雅各所代表的这真理的性质从前后文明显看出来；也就是说，就外在形式而言，它看似良善，以及从“以扫”所代表、他的“野味”所表示的良善获得的真理；但就内在形式而言，它并不是。在正经历重生，也就是重生前的人里面，属世层的真理就具有这种外在表象。事实上，这个人本人看不到这种表象，因为他对重生期间自己所具有的良善与真理一无所知；但在天堂之光中看见这类事物的天使的眼睛的确看到了。人甚至不知道何为属世层的良善与真理；并且因不知道而无法感知它们。他因总体上感知不到，故也无法具体地感知它们；因此，他觉察不出它们的不同，更不用说它们的状态变化了。既如此，那么他通过对这良善及其真理的性质的描述来理解就很困难了。但由于这些问题是本章所论述的主题，所以接下来会在尽可能理解的情况下作出解释。</p>

And he came unto his father and said, My father; and he said, Behold me, who art thou my son? That this signifies a state of perception from the presence of that truth, is evident from the representation 
of Isaac, who is here the "father;" and from the representation of Jacob, who is here the "son," concerning which several times before; also from the signification of "saying," as being to perceive, 
concerning which likewise above. From these and from the rest of the expressions it is evident that the signification herein is a state of perception from the presence of that truth which is represented 
by Jacob; but what is the quality of this truth which is now represented by Jacob is manifest from the internal sense of what goes before and of what follows, namely, that in outward form it appears 
like the good and the truth of good which are represented by Esau and are signified by his hunting, but that it is not such in its internal form. The natural as to truth in the man who is being 
regenerated, that is, before he has been regenerated, appears of this character, not indeed in the sight of man, for he knows nothing about the good and truth with him during regeneration; but in the 
sight of the angels, who see such things in the light of heaven. Man does not even know what the good and truth of the natural are; and because he does not know this, he cannot perceive it; and because 
he does not perceive it in general, neither can he perceive it in particular; thus he cannot perceive the differences, and still less the changes of their state; and this being so, he can with difficulty 
comprehend from any description how the case is with this good and its truth. But as these matters are what are treated of in this chapter, therefore in what follows the subject is to be unfolded 
insofar as it can be apprehended. </p>

'He went to his father, and said, My father. And he said, Behold, here I am; who are you, my son?' means a state of perception resulting from the presence of that truth. This becomes clear from the representation 
of Isaac, to whom 'father' refers here, and from the representation of Jacob, to whom 'son' refers, dealt with several times already; and also from the meaning of 'saying' as perceiving, 
also dealt with already. From these and all the other expressions used it is evident that it is a state of perception resulting from the presence of the truth represented by 'Jacob'. But the nature of 
this truth represented at this point by Jacob is evident from the internal sense of what comes before and after - that in outward form it is like the good and the truth acquired from good which are 
represented by 'Esau' and meant by his venison, but it is not so in inward form. With one who is being regenerated, that is, prior to his having been regenerated, the truth of the natural presents this 
outward appearance. Not indeed that the person himself sees it, for he is quite unaware of the presence of good and truth with him while he is being regenerated; but the eyes of angels who see such 
things in the light of heaven do behold it. Man is not even aware of what the good and the truth of the natural are, and being unaware of what they are he cannot perceive them. And because he does not 
perceive them in general nor is able to perceive them in particular, he does not perceive their differences, let alone their changes of state. Not perceiving these he is scarcely able to grasp from any 
description of them what this good and its truth are like. But as they are the subject in this chapter, an explanation is going to be given, so far as this can be made intelligible. </p>

</p><b>3548.</b>
`Venit ad patrem suum, et dixit, Pater mi; et dixit, Ecce me, quis tu fili mi?': quod significet statum perceptionis ex praesentia illius veri, constare potest a repraesentatione `Jishaki' qui hic pater, 
et (c)a repraesentatione `Jacobi' qui hic filius, de quibus aliquoties prius; tum a significatione `dicere' quod sit percipere, de qua etiam prius; inde et ex reliquis patet quod sit status perceptionis 
ex praesentia illius veri quod per `Jacobum' repraesentatur; sed quale hoc verum sit quod nunc per Jacobum repraesentatur, patet a sensu interno illorum quae praecedunt et quae sequuntur, quod 
nempe externa forma appareat sicut bonum et boni verum, quae repraesentantur per `Esavum' et significantur per ejus venationem, sed quod non tale in forma interna: naturale quoad verum apud hominem 
qui regeneratur, hoc est, antequam regeneratus est, tale apparet, non quidem coram homine, nam is nihil novit de (t)bono et vero apud se cum regeneratur, sed coram oculis angelorum, qui talia in luce 
caeli vident; homo ne quidem novit quid bonum et {1}verum naturalis, et quia non novit, {2}non potest percipere, et quia non percipit in communi nec potest percipere in particulari, ita non differentias, 
minus mutationes status eorum; et quia non haec, aegre potest capere ex aliqua descriptione quomodo cum hoc bono et ejus vero se habet; at quia de illis in hoc capite agitur, in sequentibus, quantum 
possit ad captum, venit exponendum. @1 quid$  @2 nec$  </p>
