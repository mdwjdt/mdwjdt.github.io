<h3 align="center" class="ired">属天的奥秘 第1676节</h3>
<h4 align="center"></h4><p><strong>1676.</strong>“一直杀到靠近旷野的伊勒巴兰”表它们的延伸范围。这从以下事实清楚可知：何利人被击打，并逃到了那么远的地方。经上提到过巴兰的旷野（创世记<a href="http://39-27.cn/创21.21.htm">21:21</a>；民数记<a href="http://39-27.cn/民10.12.htm">10:12</a>；<a href="http://39-27.cn/民12.16.htm">12:16</a>；<a href="http://39-27.cn/民13.3.htm">13:3</a>，<a href="http://39-27.cn/民13.26.htm">26</a>；申命记<a href="http://39-27.cn/申1.1.htm">1:1</a>）。“靠近旷野的伊勒巴兰”的含义在此很难解释清楚，只能说主第一次战胜由那些民族所表示的地狱尚未延伸得那么远。但“靠近旷野的伊勒巴兰”表示它延伸了多远。<br />凡未得以知晓天堂奥秘的，或许都以为主没有必要降世与地狱争战，通过祂所遭受的试探与它们争战，通过祂所遭受的试探与它们相继交战，并战胜之。因为神性全能可在任何时候征服它们，并将其关闭在它们自己的地狱。然而，主有必要降世，这是一个永恒不变的真理。不过，仅仅揭开这些奥秘的最一般的那一面，就要占用一整本书，而且还需要对这类神性秘密进行推理，要不然，人的心智无法理解。绝大多数人也不愿去理解它们。<br />故只是让人们知道就足够了，只要知道，就会相信这是一个永恒的真理：即若非主降世，通过被允许加在祂自己身上的试探征服并战胜地狱，整个人类必要灭亡；若非如此，在这个星球上，甚至自上古时代以来的所有人都不会得救。</p><br />

<p><strong>[NCE]1676.</strong> All the way to El-paran, which is up in the wilderness, symbolizes the extent of those persuasions, as can be seen from the fact that the Horites were struck and fled that far. The wilderness of Paran is mentioned in <a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_1676/bible_king-james-version_genesis_21_21" target=_top>Genesis 21:21</a>; <a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_1676/bible_king-james-version_numbers_10_12" target=_top>Numbers 10:12</a>; <a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_1676/bible_king-james-version_numbers_12_16" target=_top>12:16</a>; <a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_1676/bible_king-james-version_numbers_13_3" target=_top>13:3</a>, <a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_1676/bible_king-james-version_numbers_13_26" target=_top>26</a>; <a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_1676/bible_king-james-version_deuteronomy_1_1" target=_top>Deuteronomy 1:1</a>.<br />What El-paran, which is in the wilderness, symbolizes here is not very easy to explain. I can only say that the Lord's first victory over the hells that are symbolized by those nations did not yet reach any further. The lengths to which it did reach are symbolized by El-paran up in the wilderness.<br />[2] Those who have not received the opportunity to learn the secrets of heaven might imagine that there was no need for the Lord to come into the world in order to fight the inhabitants of the hells and to defeat and conquer them by letting himself be put to the test. He could have subdued them and shut them up in their hells simply by his divine omnipotence, such people might believe. Yet it is unshakably true that he did need to. Unraveling those secrets just in their general outlines would take a whole book, and it would take another to make enough room for rational arguments about such divine mysteries. Even then, human minds would still be unable (and for the most part unwilling) to comprehend them, no matter how well they were explained.<br />[3] It is enough to know and believe this eternal truth, since it is true: Had the Lord not come into the world to subdue and vanquish the hells by willingly undergoing trial, the human race would have perished. Human beings could not have been saved in any other way, not even those on our planet who lived in the days of the very earliest church. </p>

Even to El-paran which is in the wilderness. That this signifies their extension, may be seen from the fact that the Horites were smitten and were compelled to flee thus far. The wilderness of Paran 
is mentioned in Gen. 21:21; Num. 10:12; 12:16; 13:3, 26; Deut. 1:1. What is here signified by "El-paran which is in the wilderness," cannot so well be explained, except insofar as to say that the Lord's 
first victory over the hells signified by those nations did not as yet extend any further, but how far it did extend is signified by "El-paran in the wilderness."  [2] He to whom it has not been given 
to know heavenly arcana, may suppose that there was no need of the Lord's coming into the world to fight against the hells, and by means of temptations admitted into Himself to vanquish and conquer 
them, when they might have been subjugated at any time by the Divine Omnipotence, and shut up in their hells; but that still the fact is really so, is a certain truth. To unfold the arcana themselves 
merely as to the most general things would fill a whole work; and it would also give occasion for reasonings about such Divine mysteries as human minds would not comprehend, however fully they might 
be unfolded; and most people would not desire to comprehend them.  [3] Therefore it is sufficient for men to know, and, because it is so, to believe, that it is an eternal truth that unless the Lord 
had come into the world and subjugated and conquered the hells by means of temptations admitted into Himself, the human race would have perished; and that otherwise those who have been on this earth 
even from the time of the Most Ancient Church could not possibly have been saved. </p>

'As far as El-paran which is over into the wilderness' means the range of their extension. This becomes clear from the fact that the Horites were smitten and made to flee as far as that place. The wilderness 
of Paran is mentioned in <a href="http://bible.gospelcom.net/cgi-bin/bible?passage=Gen%2021:21&amp;version=ESV&amp;interface=print&amp;showfn=yes&amp;showxref">Gen 21:21</a>; <a href="http://bible.gospelcom.net/cgi-bin/bible?passage=Num%2010:12;%2012:16;%2013:3,%2026&amp;version=ESV&amp;interface=print&amp;showfn=yes&amp;showxref">Num 10:12; 12:16; 13:3, 26</a>; <a href="http://bible.gospelcom.net/cgi-bin/bible?passage=Deut%201:%201&amp;version=ESV&amp;interface=print&amp;showfn=yes&amp;showxref">Deut 1: 1</a>. What 'El-paran which is in the wilderness' means here cannot be easily explained beyond this, that the Lord's first 
victory over the hells meant by those nations did not as yet extend any further. But how far it did extend is meant by 'El-paran which is over into the wilderness'. </p>
<p></p>
<p><b>[2]</b>
 Anyone who has not been given 
to know heavenly arcana may imagine that there was no necessity for the Lord's Coming into the world to fight with the hells, and by means of the temptations He suffered to war successfully against 
them and overcome them, since Divine Omnipotence could at any point have subdued them and confined them to their own particular hells. That it was nevertheless necessary stands as an unchanging truth. 
To disclose merely the most general aspects of those arcana however would take up a whole work, and would also provide opportunities for reasonings about Divine mysteries which, though disclosed, 
people's minds would not grasp. Nor would the majority wish to grasp them. </p>
<p></p>
<p><b>[3]</b>
 It is enough therefore if people know and, since it is so, believe it to be an eternal truth that unless the Lord had 
come into the world and by means of the temptations which He suffered had overcome and conquered the hells, the human race would have perished, and that if He had not done so none who have lived on this 
planet even from the time of the Most Ancient Church could have been saved. </p>

</p><b>1676.</b>
'Usque El-paran, quae super in desertum': quod significet extensionem, constare potest ex eo quod 'Horitae percussi sint, et profugati eo usque'; desertum Paran memoratur, Gen. xxi 21; Num. x 12; xii 
16; xiii 3, 26; Deut. i 1.  Quid per 'El-paran, quae in deserto' hic significatur, non ita potest exponi, modo quod prima Domini victoria super inferna per istas gentes significata, adhuc non ulterius 
se extenderit; sed quousque se extendit, significatur per 'El-paran super in desertum.'  [2] Cui arcana caelestia non scire datum, is putare potest quod non opus fuisset Adventu Domini in mundum ad 
pugnandum cum infernis, et per tentationes in se admissas illa debellare et vincere, cum usque ex Omnipotentia Divina potuissent subjugari et in infernis suis includi; sed usque quod ita se res habeat, 
constans est veritas; ipsa arcana evolvere solum quoad communissima, foret integrum opus, tum quoque foret dare occasiones ad ratiocinia mysteriis Divinis, quae mentes humanae utcumque evolverentur, 
non caperent, et plerique non capere vellent: [3] quare satis est ut sciant, quia ita est, ut credant quod veritas aeterna sit, nisi Dominus venisset in mundum et per tentationes in se admissas subjugaverit 
et evicerit inferna, quod periisset genus humanum, et quod non salvari aliter potuissent, etiam qui in tellure hac fuerunt a tempore Antiquissimae Ecclesiae. </p>
