<h3 align="center" class="ired">属天的奥秘 第6657节</h3>
<h4 align="center"></h4><p><strong>6657.</strong>“就连合我们的仇敌攻击我们”表造成伤害的联盟以这种方式会变得更强大。这从“连合”、“仇敌”和“攻击我们”的含义清楚可知：“连和”是指变得更强大，因为当有大量的人加入时，敌人会变得更强大；“仇敌”是指并肩作战的联盟；“攻击我们”是指造成伤害，因为当攻击某人，就会对他造成伤害，以致他无法抵抗。此中情形是这样：每个人，以及每个善灵周围都有一个来自地狱的努力的总体气场，也有一个来自天堂的努力的总体气场。来自地狱的气场是一个努力作恶并摧毁的气场；而来自天堂的气场是一个努力行善并拯救的气场（参看<a href="6477.htm">6477</a>节）。这些是总体气场；每个人周围同样有具体的气场，因为来自地狱的灵人与他同在，来自天堂的天使也与他同在（<a href="5846.htm">5846</a>-<a href="5866.htm">5866</a>，<a href="5976.htm">5976</a>-<a href="5993.htm">5993</a>节）。人通过这些气场而被保持在平衡的状态，既有思想和意愿邪恶的自由，也有思想和意愿良善的自由。<br />因此，当教会成员进入试探时，这是当他被引入自己的邪恶时所发生的情形，他周围就会有地狱灵和天堂天使之间的争战（<a href="3927.htm">3927</a>，<a href="4249.htm">4249</a>，<a href="5036.htm">5036</a>节）；只要这个人被保持在自己的邪恶中，争战就会持续。在这种争战中，表面上看，有时地狱灵似乎就要打赢；在这种情况下，他们会涌上来。有时，他们就要被打败；在这种情况下，他们后退，因为在这种情况下，他们害怕从天上来更多天使联合起来攻击他们，因此他们会被投入地狱，再也出不来；当他们被打败时，这种情况的确会发生。这些就是“如果它们增长，力量会占优势；造成伤害的联盟以这种方式会变得更强大”这些话的意思。<br />当地狱灵与天使争战时，他们在灵人界，在那里处于自由的状态（<a href="5852.htm">5852</a>节）。由此可见，埃及人如此侵害和压迫以色列人，而以色列人越被侵害，就越多起来是什么意思；耶和华，也就是主，为他们争战，利用瘟疫控制埃及人，最后把他们都淹死在红海之中。</p>

And it will also join itself to our enemies, and fight against us. That this signifies that so their companions who would occasion evil would be strengthened, is evident from the signification of "joining 
themselves to," as being to be strengthened, for armies are strengthened when a multitude is joined to them; from the signification of "enemies," as being companions who fight along with them; and 
from the signification of "fighting against us," as being to occasion evil, for when anyone is fought against, evil is occasioned him insofar as it cannot be resisted. The case herein is this. There 
is around every man, and also around every good spirit, a general sphere of endeavors from hell, and a general sphere of endeavors from heaven. The sphere from hell is one of endeavors to do evil and 
to destroy; and the sphere from heaven is one of endeavors to do good and to save (see n. 6477). These are general spheres: in like manner there are particular spheres around each man, for spirits from 
hell are with him, and also angels from heaven (n. 5846-5866, 5976-5993). From this a man is in equilibrium, and has freedom to think and will evil, and freedom to think and will good.  [2] When 
therefore the man of the church comes into temptation, which takes place when he is let into his evil, there is then a combat around him between the spirits from hell and the angels from heaven (n. 3927, 
4249, 5036), which combat lasts so long as the man is kept in his evil. In this combat it sometimes appears to the spirits from hell that they will conquer, and then they rise up; sometimes that they 
will be conquered, and then they withdraw, because they then fear that more angels from heaven will join themselves against them, and so that they will be cast down into hell, from which they will 
no more come out, which also takes place when they have been conquered. This is what is meant by the "prevalence if it grows, and that their companions who would occasion evil would be strengthened." [3] 
When the spirits from hell fight against the angels, they are in the world of spirits, and are in freedom there (n. 5852). From all this it can now be seen what is meant in the internal sense by 
the sons of Israel being so infested and oppressed by the Egyptians, and by their being multiplied the more, the more they were infested; and by Jehovah, that is, the Lord, fighting for them, and restraining 
the Egyptians by plagues, and at last submerging them all in the sea Suph. </p>

<p align="center"><b>Elliott(1983-1999) 6657</b></p><p><b>6657.</b>
'That they also will join themselves to our enemies and fight against us' means that in that way allied forces who inflict harm will be made stronger. This is clear from the meaning of 'joining themselves 
to' as being made stronger, for when enemies are joined by a very large number they are made stronger; from the meaning of 'enemies' as allied forces who fight alongside one another; and from the 
meaning of 'fighting against us' as inflicting harm, for when a battle is fought against someone, harm is done to him to the extent that he cannot counteract it. The implications of all this are that 
surrounding every person in the world and also surrounding every good spirit there is a general sphere of endeavours from hell and a general sphere of endeavours from heaven. The sphere from hell is 
a sphere of endeavours to do harm and destroy, that from heaven is a sphere of endeavours to do good and to save, see <a href="6477.htm">6477</a>. These spheres are general ones, and there are likewise particular spheres surrounding 
every person, for there are spirits from hell present with him and there are angels from heaven, who are dealt with in <a href="5846.htm">5846</a>-<a href="5866.htm">5866</a>, <a href="5976.htm">5976</a>-<a href="5993.htm">5993</a>. By these spheres a person is kept in a state of 
equilibrium and has the freedom to think and will what is evil or to think and will what is good. </p>
<p></p>
<p><b>[2]</b>
 When therefore a member of the Church enters into temptation, which happens when he is let into 
his own evil, conflict takes place around him between the spirits from hell and the angels from heaven, <a href="3927.htm">3927</a>, <a href="4249.htm">4249</a>, <a href="5036.htm">5036</a>; and the conflict lasts for as long as the person is kept in his own evil. Sometimes 
in that conflict it seems to the spirits from hell that they are going to win, in which case they surge up. At other times it seems to them that they are going to be beaten, in which case they 
fall back, fearing that more angels from heaven will join up against them and so they themselves will be cast down into hell, never to emerge again, which is exactly what happens when they have been beaten. 
These are the things that are meant by superior strength if they increase and by the statement that allied forces who inflict harm will be made stronger.  </p>

<p><b>[3]</b>
 Spirits from hell, when they fight 
against angels, are in the world of spirits, where they are in a state of freedom, <a href="5852.htm">5852</a>. From all this one may now see what is meant in the internal sense when it says that the children of Israel 
were molested and oppressed in such ways by the Egyptians, but that the more they were molested, the more they multiplied, and that Jehovah, who is the Lord, fought for them, kept the Egyptians in check 
by means of plagues, and at length drowned all the Egyptians in the Sea Suph.  </p>

`Et adjunget se etiam ille ad inimicos nostros, et pugnabit in nos': quod significet quod sic corroborabuntur socii qui malum {1}inferent, constat ex significatione `adjungere se' quod sit corroborari; 
hostes enim, cum multitudo illis adjungitur, corroborantur; ex significatione `inimicorum' quod sint socii qui commilitant; et ex significatione `pugnare in nos' quod sit malum inferre; cum enim pugnatur 
contra aliquem, ei malum, quantum non resisti potest, infertur.  Cum his ita se habet: est circum unumquemvis hominem et quoque circum unumquemvis spiritum bonum {2},sphaera communis conatuum ab 
inferno, et sphaera communis conatuum (c)e caelo; sphaera quae ab inferno est sphaera conatuum faciendi malum et perdendi, quae (c)e caelo est sphaera conatuum faciendi bonum et salvandi, videatur n. 
6477; hae sphaerae sunt communes, pariter sunt sphaerae particulares circum unumquemvis hominem, sunt enim apud eum spiritus ab inferno, et sunt angeli e caelo, de quibus n. 5846-5866, 5976-5993; inde 
homo est in aequilibrio, et ei liberum cogitandi volendique malum ac liberum cogitandi volendique bonum. 	2 Cum {3}ergo homo Ecclesiae in tentationem venit, quod fit cum is mittitur in suum malum, 
tunc est pugna circum illum inter spiritus ab inferno et angelos e caelo, n. 3927, 4249, 5036; quae pugna durat quamdiu homo tenetur in suo malo {4};in pugna illa quandoque apparet spiritibus ab inferno 
quod vincent, et tunc insurgunt; quandoque quod vincentur, et tunc retrahunt se, quapropter tunc timent quod adjungent se plures e caelo contra illos, et sic quod dejicientur in infernum a quo non 
amplius exibunt, quod etiam fit {5}quando victi sunt; haec sunt quae intelliguntur per praevalentiam si crescit, et quod corroborarentur socii qui malum inferent. 	3 Spiritus ab inferno cum pugnant 
contra angelos, sunt in mundo spirituum, et ibi in statu libero, n. 5852.  Ex his nunc constare potest quid in sensu interno intelligitur per quod filii Israelis ita infestati et oppressi fuerint ab Aegyptiis 
et quod quantum infestati sunt, tantum multiplicati sint; et quod Jehovah, hoc est, Dominus, pugnaverit pro illis, et represserit Aegyptios per plagas, et tandem submerserit omnes in mari Suph. 	@1
