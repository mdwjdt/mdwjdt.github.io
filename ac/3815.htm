<h3 align="center" class="ired">属天的奥秘 第3815节</h3>
<h4 align="center"></h4><p><strong>3815.</strong>“拉班对雅各说，就因你是我的弟兄”表因为他们凭良善而具有血亲关系。这从“拉班”和“雅各”的代表，以及“弟兄”的含义清楚可知：“拉班”是指源自一个共同家族的旁系良善；“雅各”是指属世层的良善，如前所述；“弟兄”是指良善（参看<a href="3803.htm">3803</a>节），在此是指具有血亲关系的良善，因为这些话是拉班对雅各说的，因而是良善对良善说的。此外，一切血亲关系皆源于良善，因为良善与爱有关。在世系中，爱的最亲密程度就被称为血亲或血缘关系，严格意义上由“兄弟”来表示。在灵界或天堂，除了对主之爱和对邻之爱，或也可说，良善的血亲和姻亲关系外，并没有其它血亲和姻亲关系的存在。这一点通过以下事实向我显明，即：构成天堂的所有社群尽管不计其数，但都照着爱和由此衍生的信而彼此截然不同，互相分离（参看<a href="685.htm">685</a>，<a href="917.htm">917</a>，<a href="2739.htm">2739</a>，<a href="3612.htm">3612</a>节）。<br />这一点还通过这一事实向我清楚显明，即：在天堂，他们唯独通过良善和由此衍生的信，而非在世时所具有的任何家族关系彼此相认。父亲不认儿子或女儿，兄弟不认兄弟或姐妹，甚至丈夫不认妻子，除非他们具有相似的良善。他们在刚进入来世时的确会相逢，但很快就分道扬镳；因为良善本身，也就是爱与仁决定了一个人被送到哪个社群。血亲关系始于每个人所属的社群，并传播到周围所有地方。</p>

And Laban said unto Jacob, Because thou art my brother. That this signifies because they have blood relationship from good, is evident from the representation of Laban, as being the collateral good of 
a common stock; and from the representation of Jacob, as being the good of the natural (concerning which see above); and from the signification of "brother," as being good (n. 3803); here consanguineous 
good, because it is said by Laban to Jacob, consequently by good to good. Moreover, all blood relationship derives its origin from good, for good is of love. The nearest degree of love in the descending 
line is called blood relationship, and is understood in the proper sense by "brother." That in the spiritual world, or in heaven, no other consanguinities and affinities exist than those of love 
to the Lord and of love toward the neighbor, or what is the same, of good, has been made manifest to me by the fact that all the societies which constitute heaven, and which are innumerable, are perfectly 
distinguished from one another, in accordance with the degrees and differences of love, and thence of the derivative faith (see n. 685, 917, 2739, 3612); and also from the fact that they recognize 
each other, not from any relationship that had existed in the life of the body; but solely from good and the derivative truth. A father does not recognize a son or a daughter, nor a brother a brother 
or sister, nor even a husband a wife, unless they have been in similar good. They indeed meet when they first come into the other life, but are soon dissociated; for good itself, or love and charity, 
determines and assigns everyone to his own society. The blood relationship commences in the society in which each person is; and from this proceed the other relationships, even to the circumferences. </p>

'And Laban said to Jacob, Because you are my brother' means, because they are kindred, by virtue of good. This is clear from the representation of 'Laban' as a parallel good that springs from a common 
stock, and from the representation of 'Jacob' as the good of the natural, both dealt with above; and from the meaning of 'brother' as good, dealt with in <a href="3803.htm">3803</a>, in this case that which is kindred since 
these words are spoken by Laban to Jacob, and therefore by good to good. Furthermore every kinship has its origin in good, for good is related to love. It is the nearest degree of love in the line 
of descent that is called kindred, and is meant in the proper sense by 'brother'. In the spiritual world or in heaven no other kinships or relationships by marriage exist except those of love to the Lord 
and of love towards the neighbour, or what amounts to the same, those of good. This has been made clear to me by the fact that all the communities that constitute heaven, and that are countless, are 
quite distinct and separate from one another according to degrees and differences of love and of faith deriving from this, see <a href="685.htm">685</a>, <a href="917.htm">917</a>, <a href="2739.htm">2739</a>, <a href="3612.htm">3612</a>. </p>
<p></p>
<p><b>[2]</b>
 This has also been made clear to me by the 
fact that in heaven they do not acknowledge one another because of any family relationship that had been theirs during their lifetime but solely on the basis of good and attendant truth. A father does 
not acknowledge a son or daughter, a brother does not acknowledge a brother or sister, and even a husband does not acknowledge his wife, unless they have been governed by similar good. They do, it 
is true, meet when they first enter the next life, but they part company after that; for good itself - that is, love and charity - determines whichever community a person is sent to. Kinship begins in 
the community in which each person belongs and spreads from there into all places round about. </p>

</p><b>3815.</b>
`Et dixit Laban Jacobo, Num quia frater meus tu':  quod significet quia consanguinei ex bono, constat a repraesentatione  `Labanis' quod sit bonum communis stirpis collaterale, et ex repraesentatione 
`Jacobi' quod sit bonum naturalis, de quibus supra; et a significatione `fratris' quod sit bonum, de qua n.  3803, hic consanguineum quia dicitur a Labane ad Jacobum, proinde a bono ad bonum {1}; 
omnis etiam consanguinitas originem ducit a bono, nam bonum est amoris; est proximus gradus amoris in linea descendente qui dicitur consanguineus, et intelligitur in sensu proprio per `fratrem': 
 quod in mundo spirituali seu caelo non aliae consanguinitates et affinitates dentur quam amoris in Dominum et amoris erga proximum, seu quod idem, quam boni, constare mihi potuit ex eo quod omnes 
societates quae caelum constituunt, et innumerabiles sunt, inter se distinctissimae sint, secundum gradus et differentias amoris et inde fidei, videatur n. 685, 917, 2739, 3612; [2]tum ex eo quod 
ibi se mutuo (t)agnoscant non ex quadam state quae fuerat illis in vita corporis, sed solummodo ex bono et inde vero, non pater filium aut filiam, nec frater fratrem aut sororem, ne quidem maritus 
uxorem, nisi fuerint in simili bono, conveniunt quidem cum primum in alteram vitam veniunt, sed dissociantur, nam Ipsum bonum, seu amor et charitas, determinat et addicit quemcumque suae societati; 
in societate in qua unusquisque est, incohat consanguinitas, et inde progrediuntur affinitates usque ad circuitus. @1 quia frater meus tu$ </p>
