<h3 align="center" class="ired">属天的奥秘 第9015节</h3>
<h4 align="center"></h4><p><strong>9015.</strong>“打父母的”表亵渎主及其国度。这从“打”和“父母”的含义清楚可知：“打”是指通过虚假伤害（参看<a href="7136.htm">7136</a>，<a href="7146.htm">7146</a>，<a href="9007.htm">9007</a>节），当论及主及其国度，是指亵渎；“父”是指主，“母”是指祂的国度（参看<a href="8897.htm">8897</a>节），那里解释了第四条诫命，并说明“尊敬父母”在内义上表示什么，即表示爱主及其国度，因此在相对意义上是指爱良善和真理。所以“打父母”在相对意义上还表示亵渎教会的良善和真理。</p>

<p align="center"><b>Potts(1905-1910) 9015</b></p><p><b>9015.</b>
And he that smiteth his father and his mother. That this signifies the blaspheming of the Lord and of His kingdom, is evident from the signification of "smiting," as being to injure by means of falsities 
(see n. 7136, 7146, 9007), and when predicated of the Lord and of His kingdom, as being to blaspheme; and from the signification of "father," as being the Lord; and of "mother," as being His kingdom. 
See n. 8897, where the fourth commandment of the Decalogue was unfolded, and it was shown what is meant in the internal sense by "honoring father and mother," namely, to love the Lord and His Kingdom, 
and therefore in the relative sense, to love good and truth. So also "to smite father and mother," in the relative sense denotes to blaspheme the good and truth of the church. </p>

<p align="center"><b>Elliott(1983-1999) 9015</b></p><p><b>9015.</b>
'And anyone striking his father and his mother' means blaspheming the Lord and His kingdom. This is clear from the meaning of 'striking' as injuring by means of falsities, dealt with in <a href="7136.htm">7136</a>, <a href="7146.htm">7146</a>, <a href="9007.htm">9007</a>, 
but when used in reference to the Lord and His kingdom, blaspheming is meant by it; and from the meaning of 'father' as the Lord, and of 'mother' as His kingdom, dealt with in <a href="8897.htm">8897</a>, where the fourth 
commandment has been explained. That paragraph shows what 'honouring father and mother' is used to mean in the internal sense, namely loving the Lord and His kingdom, and therefore in the relative 
sense loving what is good and true. So also 'striking father and mother' in a relative sense means blaspheming what is good and true in the Church </p>

`Et percutiens patrem suum et matrem suam':  quod significet blasphemationem Domini et regni Ipsius, constat ex significatione `percutere' quod sit laedere per falsa, de qua n. 7136, 7146, 9007, at 
cum praedicatur de Domino (c)et de Ipsius regno, est (x)blasphemare; ex significatione `patris' quod sit Dominus, et `matris' quod sit regnum Ipsius, de qua n.  8897, ubi explicatum est praeceptum decalogi 
quartum, et ostensum quid in sensu interno intelligitur per `honorare patrem et matrem,' quod nempe {1}sit amare Dominum et regnum Ipsius, et inde in sensu respectivo {2}amare bonum et verum; ita 
etiam `percutere patrem et matrem' in sensu respectivo est blasphemare bonum et verum Ecclesiae. @1 amor pro Domino et pro Regno$ @2 pro bono  et vero$ </p>
