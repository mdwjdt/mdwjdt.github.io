<h3 align="center" class="ired">属天的奥秘 第9383节</h3>
<h4 align="center"></h4><p><strong>9383.</strong>“耶和华一切的话、一切的典章”表圣言中系属灵状态和属世状态下的生活准则的事物。这从“耶和华的话”和“典章”的含义清楚可知：“耶和华的话”是指圣言中系属灵状态下的生活准则的事物，如下文所述；“典章”是指圣言中系属世状态下的生活准则的事物。之所以说“属灵状态下”和“属世状态下”，是因为一般来说，每个人都有两种状态。一种是内在人所特有的，适合内在人，被称为属灵状态；而另一种是外在人所特有的，适合外在人，被称为属世状态。内在人的状态之所以被称为属灵的，是因为它受属于天堂之光的真理和属于这光的热，也就是爱的良善影响。这光被称为属灵之光，因为它光照理解力；这热被称为属灵之热，它是爱并点燃意愿。正因如此，内在人的状态被称为一种属灵状态。而外在人的状态之所以被称为一种属世状态，是因为它受属于尘世之光的真理和属于这光之热的良善影响；这热也是爱，不过是对诸如存在于世界上的那类事物的爱；因为一切生命之热都是爱。正因如此，外在人的状态被称为属世的。属世状态下的生活准则由“典章”来表示；而属灵状态下的生活准则由“耶和华的话”来表示。<br />这二者皆源于圣言，因为生活的一切准则都在圣言中。它们含有生命本身在里面，因为从主，就是生命本身发出并将继续发出的神性真理就在圣言中。由此可知，圣言中的一切都是生活的准则；而且那里的一切都与生活有关；这从圣言的一切所基于的两条诫命可以看出来，关于这两条诫命，我们在马太福音中读到：<br />耶稣说，你要尽心，尽性，尽意，爱主你的神。这是诫命中的第一，且是最大的。其次也相仿，就是要爱邻如己。律法和先知，都系於这两条诫命。（马太福音<a href="http://39-27.cn/太22.37.htm">22:37</a>-<a href="http://39-27.cn/太22.40.htm">40</a>；以及马可福音<a href="http://39-27.cn/可12.29.htm">12:29</a>-<a href="http://39-27.cn/可12.31.htm">31</a>）<br />“爱神和邻舍”就是生活的准则，因为生命的一切皆属于爱，以致没有爱，就没有生命；爱如何，生命就如何。“律法和先知”是指整部圣言。</p>

All the words of Jehovah and all the judgments. That this signifies those things in the Word that belong to life in the spiritual and in the natural state, is evident from the signification of "the words 
of Jehovah," as being those things in the Word that belong to life in the spiritual state (of which in what follows); and from the signification of "the judgments," as being those things in the Word 
that belong to life in the natural state. It is said "in the spiritual state," and "in the natural state," because with every man there are in general two states; one peculiar and proper to the internal 
man, which is called the spiritual state; and the other peculiar and proper to the external man, which is called the natural state. The reason why the state of the internal man is called spiritual, 
is that it is affected by the truths which are of the light of heaven, and by the good which is of the heat of this light, which heat is love. This light is called spiritual light because it illumines 
the understanding; and this heat is called spiritual heat, which is love and enkindles the will. Hence it is that the state of the internal man is called a spiritual state.  But the reason why 
the state of the external man is called a natural state, is that it is affected by the truths which are of the light of the world, and by the good which is of the heat of this light; which heat also is 
love, but the love of such things as are in the world; for all the heat of life is love. Hence it is that the state of the external man is called natural. Those things which are of life in the natural 
state are meant by "judgments;" but those which are of life in the spiritual state are meant by "the words of Jehovah."  [2] That both are from the Word is because in the Word are all things that 
are of life, for they have in them life itself; because in the Word is the Divine truth which has proceeded and still proceeds from the Lord, who is life itself. It is from this that all things in the 
Word are matters of life; and also that all things therein have relation to the life; as can be seen from the two commandments on which all things of the Word are based, of which we read in Matthew: </p>
<p> 
    Jesus said, Thou shalt love the Lord thy God from all thy heart, and in all thy soul, and in all thy mind. This is the first and great commandment. The second Is like unto it, Thou shalt love thy 
neighbor as thyself. On these two commandments hang the law and the prophets (Matt. 22:37-40; also Mark 12:29-31); </p>
<p>"to love God and the neighbor" is of the life, because everything of life is of love, 
insomuch that without love there is no life; and such as the love is, such is the life. "The law and the prophets" denote the whole Word. </p>

<p align="center"><b>Elliott(1983-1999) 9383</b></p><p><b>9383.</b>
'All Jehovah's words and all the judgements' means things in the Word which are rules of life in the spiritual state and in the natural state. This is clear from the meaning of 'Jehovah's words' as things 
in the Word which are rules of life in the spiritual state, dealt with below; and from the meaning of 'the judgements' as things in the Word which are rules of life in the natural state. The terms 
'in the spiritual state' and 'in the natural state' are used because in general every person has two states. The first is peculiar and proper to the internal man and is called the spiritual state, 
the second is peculiar and proper to the external man and is called the natural state. The internal man's state is called spiritual because it is conditioned by truths belonging to the light of heaven, 
and by good belonging to the heat of that light, which is love. That light is called spiritual light because it enlightens the understanding part of the mind, and that heat is called spiritual heat, 
which is love and warms the will part. This is the reason why the internal man's state is called spiritual. But the external man's state is called natural because it is conditioned by truths belonging 
to the light of the world and by good belonging to the heat of this light, which too is love, but love for such things as exist in the world, for all heat of life is love. This is the reason why the 
external man's state is called natural. Rules of life in the natural state are meant by 'the judgements', while rules of life in the spiritual state are meant by 'Jehovah's words'.  </p>
<p></p>
<p><b>[2]</b>
 Both of these 
are derived from the Word because all the rules of life are there. They hold Life itself within them, for in the Word resides Divine Truth which has emanated and continues to emanate from the Lord, 
who is Life itself. From this it follows that all things in the Word are rules of life, and also that all things there have reference to life, as may be seen from those two commandments on which all 
things in the Word are founded, and about which the following is recorded in Matthew,  </p>
<blockquote>
Jesus said, You shall love the Lord your God with all your heart, and with all your soul, and with all your mind. 
This is the first and great commandment. The second is like it, You shall love your neighbour as yourself. On these two commandments the Law and the Prophets depend. <a href="http://bible.gospelcom.net/cgi-bin/bible?passage=Matt%2022:37-40&amp;version=ESV&amp;interface=print&amp;showfn=yes&amp;showxref">Matt 22:37-40</a>; <a href="http://bible.gospelcom.net/cgi-bin/bible?passage=Mark%2012:29-31&amp;version=ESV&amp;interface=print&amp;showfn=yes&amp;showxref">Mark 12:29-31</a>. 
</blockquote>
<p>'Loving God and the neighbour' is a rule of life because the all of life belongs to love, so much so that without love life is not life, and the character of the love determines that of the life. 
The Law and the Prophets are the whole Word.  </p>

</p><b>9383.</b>
`Omnia verba Jehovae et omnia judicia': quod significet quae in Verbo vitae sunt in statu spirituali et naturali, constat ex significatione `verborum Jehovae' quod sint quae in Verbo vitae sunt in statu 
spirituali, de qua sequitur, et ex significatione `judiciorum' quod sint quae in Verbo vitae sunt in statu naturali.  Dicitur in statu spirituali et in statu naturali quia apud unumquemvis hominem 
{1}in genere bini status sunt; unus qui peculiaris et proprius est interno homini, qui status spiritualis vocatur, alter qui peculiaris et proprius est externo homini, qui status naturalis vocatur; 
quod status interni hominis dicatur spiritualis, est quia ille afficitur veris, quae sunt lucis caeli, et afficitur bono, quod est caloris illius lucis, qui est amor; illa lux vocatur lux spiritualis 
quia illuminat intellectuale, et ille calor vocatur calor spiritualis, qui est amor, et accendit voluntarium; inde est quod status interni hominis dicatur status spiritualis; quod autem status externi 
hominis dicatur naturalis, est quia ille afficitur veris quae sunt lucis mundi, et bono quod est caloris illius lucis, qui etiam est amor, sed amor talium quae in mundo sunt; omnis enim calor vitae est 
amor; inde est quod status externi hominis dicatur {2}naturalis; illa quae sunt vitae in statu naturali, intelliguntur per `judicia,' quae autem sunt vitae in statu spirituali, intelliguntur per `verba 
Jehovae.' Quod sint quae ex Verbo, est quia ibi sunt omnia quae vitae 2 sunt, in se enim ipsam vitam habent, quoniam ibi {3}est Divinum Verum quod processit et quod procedit ex Domino, Qui est ipsa 
vita.  Quod omnia quae in Verbo sint vitae, inde est, tum quod omnia ibi se referant ad vitam, {4}ut constare potest ex binis praeceptis super quibus omnia Verbi fundantur, de quibus apud Matthaeum, Jesus 
dixit, Amabis Dominum Deum tuum ex toto corde tuo, et in tota anima tua, et in tota mente tua; hoc est primarium et magnum praeceptum; secundum simile est illi, Amabis proximum tuum sicut teipsum; 
in his duobus praeceptis lex et prophetae pendent, xxii 35-38 [A.V. 37-40]; Marc. xii 29-31; </p>
<p>`amare Deum et proximum' est vitae quia omne vitae est amoris, usque adeo ut absque amore nulla sit 
vita, et qualis amor talis vita; `lex et prophetae' sunt totum Verbum. @1 bini status communius$ @2 i status$ @3 After Verum$ @4 constat$ </p>
