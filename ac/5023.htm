<h3 align="center" class="ired">属天的奥秘 第5023节</h3>
<h4 align="center"></h4><p><strong>5023.</strong>“等着他的主来到家里”表好使它可以与属世良善交流。这从“主”的含义清楚可知，“主”是指非属灵的属世良善（<a href="4973.htm">4973</a>，<a href="4988.htm">4988</a>节）。“家”在内义上是指属世心智，因为属世心智，和理性心智一样，就像一个家：其中丈夫是良善，妻子是真理，女儿和儿子是对良善与真理的情感，以及源于前者（即丈夫和妻子所代表的良善与真理）如同源于父母的良善与真理；而男女仆人则是事奉并支持它们的快乐和记忆知识。所以此处“等着他的主来到家里”表示等属世良善来到自己的居所，那里也有与它结合的真理；但在这种情况下，它是虚假，却说服良善相信它是真理，因为非属灵的属世良善很容易被说服相信虚假就是真理，真理就是虚假。 经这之所以说“他的主”，是因为非属灵的属世之物视属灵之物为某种卑贱之物，或仆人（<a href="5013.htm">5013</a>节）。<br />人的属世心智和他的理性心智一样，被称为“家”；这一点从以下经文明显看出来：<br />污灵从人里面出来，走遍干旱之地，寻求安歇；既寻不着，便说：我要回到我所出来的屋里去。到了，就看见那屋子打扫干净，修饰好了，他就去带了另外七个比自己更恶的污灵来，进去住在那里。（路加福音<a href="http://39-27.cn/路11.24.htm">11:24</a>-<a href="http://39-27.cn/路11.26.htm">26</a>）<br />“家”在此表示属世心智，当它里面没有“丈夫与妻子”所表示的良善与真理，“女儿与儿子”所表示的对良善与真理的情感，也没有诸如“男女仆人”所表示的那支持之物时，就被称为“打扫干净”的空屋。这个人自己就是“家”，因为理性心智与属世心智构成一个人；没有这些事物，也就是没有良善与真理，以及对它们的情感，和这些情感所提供的服务，他不就是一个人，而是一个野兽。<br />在路加福音中，“家”还表示人的心智：<br />凡一国自相纷争，就成为荒场；凡一家自相纷争，就必败落。（路加福音<a href="http://39-27.cn/路书11.17.htm">11:17</a>）<br />马可福音：<br />若一国自相纷争，那国就站立不住；若一家自相纷争，那家就站立不住。没有人能进壮士家里，抢夺他的家具；必先捆住那壮士，才可以抢夺他的家。（马可福音<a href="http://39-27.cn/可3.24.htm">3:24</a>，<a href="http://39-27.cn/可3.25.htm">25</a>，<a href="http://39-27.cn/可3.27.htm">27</a>）<br />“国”表示真理（<a href="1672.htm">1672</a>，<a href="2547.htm">2547</a>，<a href="4691.htm">4691</a>节），“家”表示良善（<a href="2233.htm">2233</a>，<a href="2234.htm">2234</a>，<a href="3720.htm">3720</a>，<a href="4982.htm">4982</a>节）；“家”由于更重要而表示良善。<br />路加福音：<br />家主若知道贼什么时候来，就必警醒，不让他的房屋给挖透了。（路加福音<a href="http://39-27.cn/路12.39.htm">12:39</a>）<br /><br />从今以后，一家五口将起纷争，三个和两个相争，两个和三个相争。父亲和儿子相争，儿子和父亲相争；母亲和女儿相争，女儿和母亲相争。（路加福音<a href="http://39-27.cn/路12.52.htm">12:52</a>-<a href="http://39-27.cn/路12.53.htm">53</a>）<br />此处论述的主题是圣言的内在或属灵内容被打开后，教会成员所进入的属灵争战。“家”表示实际的人或他的心智；而“父亲”、“母亲”、“儿子”和“女儿”是指良善与真理，以及对它们的情感，在反面意义上则指邪恶与虚假，以及对它们的情感，它们是争战的根源，以及在这类争战中要与之搏斗的东西。<br />主吩咐祂的门徒说：<br />无论进哪一家，先要说，愿这一家平安！那里若有当得平安的人，你们所求的平安就必临到那家；不然，就归与你们了；你们要住在那家，吃喝他们所供给的；不要从这家搬到那家。（路加福音<a href="http://39-27.cn/路10.5.htm">10:5</a>-<a href="http://39-27.cn/路10.7.htm">7</a>）<br />这代表他们要住在良善本身中，也就是住在对主之爱和对邻之仁的良善中，不是进入其它任何良善。“家”表示人或他的心智（也可参看<a href="3538.htm">3538</a>，<a href="4973.htm">4973</a>节）。</p>

<p align="center"><b>Potts(1905-1910) 5023</b></p><p><b>5023.</b>
Until his lord came to his house. That this signifies that it might communicate with natural good, is evident from the signification of the "lord," as being good natural not spiritual (n. 4973, 4988). 
A "house" in the internal sense is the natural mind, for the natural mind, as also the rational mind, is like a house: the husband therein is good, the wife is truth, the daughters and sons are affections 
of good and truth, and also goods and truth derived from the former as parents; the maidservants and menservants are the pleasures and memory-knowledges which minister and confirm. Here therefore 
by "until his lord came to his house" is signified until natural good came to its dwelling place, where there is also truth conjoined with it; but here falsity persuading good that it is truth, for 
good natural not spiritual is easily persuaded that falsity is truth, and that truth is falsity. It is said "his lord," because the natural not spiritual considers the spiritual as a servant (n. 5013). [2] 
That the natural and the rational mind of man are called a "house," is evident from the following passages: </p>
<p>	When the unclean spirit is gone out from a man, he wandereth through dry places, seeking 
rest; and if he findeth it not, he saith, I will return unto my house whence I came out. And if on coming he findeth it swept and garnished, he then goeth away and taketh to him seven other spirits 
worse than himself; and they enter in and dwell there (Luke 11:24-26); </p>
<p>the "house" here denotes the natural mind, which is called a "house that is empty and swept" when there are within it no goods 
and truths, which are the husband and wife; no affections of good and truth, which are the daughters and sons; nor such things as confirm, which are the maidservants and menservants. The man himself 
is the "house," because the rational and the natural mind make the man; and without these things, that is, without goods and truths and their affections and the ministry of these affections, he is 
not a man, but a brute. [3] The mind of man is also meant by a "house" in the same evangelist: </p>
<p>	Every kingdom divided against itself is laid waste, and house falleth upon house (Luke 11:17); </p>
<p>And in 
Mark: </p>
<p>	If a kingdom be divided against itself, this Kingdom cannot stand. And if a house be divided against itself, this house cannot stand. No one can pillage the vessels of a strong man after entering 
into his house, unless he first bind the strong man; and then he pillages his house (Mark 3:24, 25, 27); </p>
<p>by "kingdom" is signified truth (n. 1672, 2547, 4691), and by "house," good (n. 2233, 2234, 
3720, 4982); "house" signifies good in an eminent sense. [4] In Luke: </p>
<p>	If the master of the house had known in what hour the thief would come, he would at least have watched, and would not have suffered 
his house to be broken through (Luke 12:39). Again: </p>
<p>	From henceforth there shall be five in one house [divided], three against two, and two against three. The father shall be divided against 
the son, and the son against the father; the mother against the daughter, and the daughter against the mother (Luke 12:52-53); </p>
<p>where the subject treated of is the spiritual combats into which those 
who are of the church will come, after the internal or spiritual things of the Word have been opened. The "house" denotes man, or his mind; "father," "mother," "son," and "daughter" are goods and truths 
with their affections, and in the opposite sense evils and falsities with their affections, from which and with which there is combat. [5] The Lord's command to His disciples: </p>
<p>	Into whatsoever house 
ye enter, first say, Peace be to this house; and if a son of peace be there, your peace shall rest upon it; but if not, it shall return upon you; but remain in the same house; eat and drink what they 
have; pass not from house to house (Luke 10:5-7); </p>
<p>represented that they should abide in good itself, that is, in the good of love to the Lord and of charity toward the neighbor, and not pass into 
any other. (That man or his mind is a "house" may be seen also above, n. 3538, 4973.) </p>

<p align="center"><b>Elliott(1983-1999) 5023</b></p><p><b>5023.</b>
'Until his lord came to his house' means so that it might communicate with natural good. This is clear from the meaning of 'lord' as unspiritual natural good, dealt with in <a href="4973.htm">4973</a>, <a href="4988.htm">4988</a>. 'House' in the 
internal sense is the natural mind, for the natural mind, like the rational mind also, resembles a house. 'The husband' in it is good, 'the wife' truth; 'the daughters and sons' are affections for good 
and truth, as well as being forms of good and truth which are begotten from that aforesaid good and truth as their parents, while 'the women servants and the men servants' are the desires and the known 
facts that minister to and support them. Here therefore 'until his lord came to his house' means when natural good comes to its own dwelling-place, where also there is the truth that is joined to 
it, though in this case it is falsity which convinces the good that it is truth. For unspiritual natural good is easily convinced that falsity is truth and that truth is falsity. The expression 'his 
lord' is used because the unspiritual natural looks on the spiritual as something servile, <a href="5013.htm">5013</a>. </p>
<p></p>
<p><b>[2]</b>
 The fact that a person's natural mind, like his rational mind, is called 'a house' is evident from 
the following places: In Luke, </p>
<blockquote>
When the unclean spirit has gone out of a person he passes through dry places seeking rest; and if he does not find any he says, I will return to my house out of which 
I came. And if when he comes he finds it swept and decorated, he goes away and brings seven other spirits more evil than himself, and they enter in and dwell there. <a href="http://bible.gospelcom.net/cgi-bin/bible?passage=Luke%2011:24-26&amp;version=ESV&amp;interface=print&amp;showfn=yes&amp;showxref">Luke 11:24-26</a>. 
</blockquote>
<p>'House' here 
stands for the natural mind, which is called a house that is 'empty and swept'<A name="fntext1"></a><A href="#fn1"><sup>a</sup></a> when there are no forms of good and truth in it meant by 'husband and wife', no affections for good and truth meant by 
'daughters and sons', nor anything such as supports these meant by 'women servants and men servants'. The person himself is 'the house' because the rational mind together with the natural mind constitutes 
a human being. Without the inhabitants just mentioned - that is, without the forms of good and truth, and without the affections for these, and the service rendered by those affections - a person 
is not a human being but a beast. </p>
<p></p>
<p><b>[3]</b>
 The human mind is again meant by 'a house' in the same gospel,   </p>
<blockquote>
Every kingdom divided against itself is laid waste, and house falls upon house. <a href="http://bible.gospelcom.net/cgi-bin/bible?passage=Luke%2011:17&amp;version=ESV&amp;interface=print&amp;showfn=yes&amp;showxref">Luke 11:17</a>. 
</blockquote>
<p>And 
in Mark, </p>
<blockquote>
If a kingdom is divided against itself, this kingdom cannot stand. Also, if a house is divided against itself, this house cannot stand. No one can go into the house and plunder the 
vessels of a strong man unless he first binds the strong man, and then he may plunder his house. <a href="http://bible.gospelcom.net/cgi-bin/bible?passage=Mark%203:14,%2025,%2027&amp;version=ESV&amp;interface=print&amp;showfn=yes&amp;showxref">Mark 3:14, 25, 27</a>. 
</blockquote>
<p>'Kingdom' means truth, <a href="1672.htm">1672</a>, <a href="2547.htm">2547</a>, <a href="4691.htm">4691</a>, and 'house' good, <a href="2233.htm">2233</a>, <a href="2234.htm">2234</a>, <a href="3720.htm">3720</a>, <a href="4982.htm">4982</a>, 
'house' meaning good on account of its greater importance.  </p>
<p></p>
<p><b>[4]</b>
 In Luke, </p>
<blockquote>
If the householder had known at what hour the thief was coming he would certainly have been awake and would not have 
permitted his house to be broken into. <a href="http://bible.gospelcom.net/cgi-bin/bible?passage=Luke%2012:39&amp;version=ESV&amp;interface=print&amp;showfn=yes&amp;showxref">Luke 12:39</a>. 
</blockquote>
<p>In the same gospel, </p>
<blockquote>
From now on there will be in one house five divided, three against two, and two against three. Father will be divided against 
son and son against father, mother against daughter and daughter against mother. <a href="http://bible.gospelcom.net/cgi-bin/bible?passage=Luke%2012:52,%2053&amp;version=ESV&amp;interface=print&amp;showfn=yes&amp;showxref">Luke 12:52, 53</a>. 
</blockquote>
<p>This refers to the spiritual conflicts which members of the Church enter into once the internal or 
spiritual contents of the Word have been opened up to them. 'House' stands for the actual person or his mind, while the 'father', 'mother', 'son', and 'daughter' in it are forms of good and truth together 
with affections for these, or in the contrary sense evils and falsities together with affections for these, which are the source of conflict and the things to be grappled with in such conflict. </p>
<p></p>
<p><b>[5]</b>
The Lord commanded His disciples, in Luke, </p>
<blockquote>
Whatever house you enter, first say, Peace be to this house! And if indeed a son of peace is there, your peace shall rest on it; but if not, it shall 
return to you. But remain in the same house; eat and drink what they have there. Do not pass on from house to house. <a href="http://bible.gospelcom.net/cgi-bin/bible?passage=Luke%2010:5-7&amp;version=ESV&amp;interface=print&amp;showfn=yes&amp;showxref">Luke 10:5-7</a>. 
</blockquote>
<p>This represented the requirement for them to remain with genuine 
good, that is, with the good of love to the Lord and of charity towards the neighbour, and not to pass on to any other kind. For more about the actual person or his mind being meant by 'a house', see 
also <a href="3538.htm">3538</a>, <a href="4973.htm">4973</a>.

Usque venire dominum ejus ad domum suam': quod significet ut communicaret cum bono naturali, constat a significatione `domini' quod sit bonum naturale non spirituale, de qua n. 4973, 4988; `domus' 
in sensu interno est mens naturalis; mens enim naturalis, sicut etiam mens rationalis, est instar domus, `maritus' ibi est bonum, `uxor' est verum, `filiae et filii' sunt affectiones boni et veri, 
tum quoque bona et vera quae sunt' ex illis ut parentibus, `ancillae et servi' sunt voluptates et scientifica quae, ministrant et confirmant; hic itaque per `usque venire dominum ejus ad domum suam' 
significatur bonum (o)naturale ad habitationem suam, ubi etiam (o)est verum ei conjunctum, hic autem {1} falsum persuadens bono quod verum sit; bonum enim naturale non spirituale facile persuadetur 
quod falsum sit verum et quo verum sit falsum: `dominus ejus' dicitur quia naturale non spirituale considerat spirituale ut servum, n. 5013.  [2] Quod mens naturalis et mens rationalis hominis 
dicatur `domus', patet ab his locis {2}; apud Lucam, </p>
<p>          Quando immundus spiritus exiverit ex homine,      peragrat (o)per sicca loca quaerens requiem, quam si non      invenit, dicit, Revertar 
in domum meam unde egressus sum,      quam si veniens invenit scopis purgatam et ornatam, tunc      abit et assumit septem alios spiritus se pejores, et      ingressi habitant ibi, xi 24-26; </p>
<p> `domus' 
ibi pro mente naturali, quae dicitur `domus vacua et scopis purgata' cum ibi non bona et vera quae `maritus et uxor', non affectiones boni et veri quae `filiae et filii', nec talia quae confirmant 
quae `ancillae et servi'; ipse homo est `domus' quia mens rationalis et naturalis facit hominem; absque illis, hoc est, absque bonis et veris et eorum affectionibus et harum ministerio, non 
est homo, sed brutum.  [3] Mens hominis (o)etiam intelligitur per domum, apud eundem {3},           Omne regnum contra seipsum divisum vastatur, et      domus super domum cadit, xi 17: </p>
<p>et apud 
Marcum,           Si regnum contra seipsum dividitur, non potest      consistere regnum hoc; etiam si domus contra seipsam      dividitur, non potest consistere domus haec.... Non      potest quisquam 
vasa fortis ingressus in domum ejus,      diripere, nisi prius fortem vinciat, et tunc domum ejus      diripiat, iii 24, 25, 27 {4}; </p>
<p>per `regnum' significatur verum, n. 1672, 2547, 4691, et 
per `domum' bonum, n. 2233, 2234, 3720, 4982, (o)`domus' significat bonum ex potiore: [4] apud Lucam,           Si nosset paterfamilias, qua hora fur venturus      esset, vigilaturus utique esset,
