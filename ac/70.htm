<h4 align="center"></h4><p><strong>70.</strong>我既被允许揭示这多年来的所见所闻，就让我先谈谈人复活的过程，也就是人从肉身进入永生的过程。为叫我确知人死后依然活着，我被允许与生前所识的许多人交谈，不是一日两日，而是经年累月，正如在尘世来往一样。他们都很诧异，在肉身时，他们竟不相信自己死后依然活着，而事实上，肉身的生命与来生之间几乎没有一日之隔，因为死亡是生命的延续。</p>

<p><strong>[NCE]70.</strong> Now that I may reveal what I have experienced for the past several years, I must begin with the circumstances of our resurrection, or the way in which we leave bodily life to enter eternal life.<br />To convince me that people live on after death, I was allowed to talk and spend time with many people known to me during their physical life, which I did, not just for a day or a week, but for months and almost as much as a year. Our interactions were the same as they had been in the world.<br />These acquaintances were positively astounded that while living the life of the body they had been (and many others still are) so skeptical — skeptical to the point that they did not believe they would continue to live after death. The truth, they found, is that little more than a day passes after the demise of the body before we enter the next life, since that life is a continuation of this. </p>
<p align="center"><b>Potts(1905-1910) 70</b></p><p><b>70.</b>
As it is permitted me to disclose what for several years I have heard and seen, it shall here be told, first, how the case is with man when he is being resuscitated; or how he enters from the life of 
the body into the life of eternity. In order that I might know that men live after death, it has been given me to speak and be in company with many who were known to me during their life in the body; 
and this not merely for a day or a week, but for months, and almost a year, speaking and associating with them just as in this world. They wondered exceedingly that while they lived in the body they 
were, and that very many others are, in such incredulity as to believe that they will not live after death; when in fact scarcely a day intervenes after the death of the body before they are in the other 
life; for death is a continuation of life. </p>

<p align="center"><b>Elliott(1983-1999) 70</b></p><p><b>70.</b>
Since I am at liberty to disclose what I have heard and seen these several years, I need now at the out set to state what happens to a Person when he is re-awakened, that is, to state the process by 
which he passes from the life of the body into that of eternity. So that I might know that people do live on after death, I was allowed to talk to and mix with many whom I knew during their lifetime. 
And this has not been for just a day or a week, but for months and up to a year; I have talked to them and mixed with them just as I did in the world. They were utterly amazed that during their lifetime, 
like the majority of other people, they were so disbelieving that they thought they would not be alive after death, though in fact scarcely days stand between the death of the body and being in the 
next life, for it is a continuation of life.  </p>

</p><b>70.</b>
Quia licet aperire quae per aliquot annos audivi et vidi, hic primum dicendum quomodo se habet cum homine cum resuscitatur, seu quomodo a vita corporis intrat in vitam aeternitatis: utque scirem quod 
vivant homines post mortem, datum est loqui et conversari cum pluribus qui mihi noti fuerant in vita eorum corporis, et non quidem per diem et septimanam sed per menses et fere annum, cum quibus locutus 
et conversatus sicut in mundo: qui maximopere mirati quod ii dum vixerunt in corpore, fuerint, et quod alii et plerique sint, in tali incredulitate ut putent se non victuros post mortem, cum tamen 
vix intercedunt dies post corporis obitum antequam in altera vita sunt, nam est continuatio vitae. </p>
