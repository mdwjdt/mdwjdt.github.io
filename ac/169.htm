<h4 align="center"></h4><p><strong>169.</strong>我被带入身体失去知觉的状态，好似濒死之人，但我保留着内在的生命和思维的能力，并有足够的气息维持生命，直到呼吸归于寂静。这样，我能觉察并记忆人从死里复生的经历。</p>

<p><strong>[NCE]169.</strong> I was brought into a state in which I was unaware of physical sensation — almost into the condition of someone who is dying. My inner life and thinking remained unimpaired, however, so that I would perceive and remember what was happening. I underwent the same experiences as those who have died and are being revived, when their breathing is at first consistent with continued life and then falls silent. </p>
<p align="center"><b>Potts(1905-1910) 169</b></p><p><b>169.</b>
I was reduced into a state of insensibility as to the bodily senses, thus almost into the state of dying persons, retaining however my interior life unimpaired, attended with the power of thinking, and 
with sufficient breathing for life, and finally with a tacit breathing, that I might perceive and remember what happens to those who have died and are being resuscitated. </p>

<p align="center"><b>Elliott(1983-1999) 169</b></p><p><b>169.</b>
I was brought into a state where my physical senses were rendered insensible, that is, into the state almost of people who are dying, but with my interior life, together with my ability to think, remaining 
intact. This was done so that I might perceive and retain in the memory what happens to people who have died and are being awakened, with enough breathing to support life, and after that with a 
soundless breathing.<A name="fntext1"></a><A href="#fn1"><sup>a</sup></a>

{1}  In statum insensibilitatis {2} quoad corporeos sensus perductus sum, ita paene in statum morientium, manente tamen interiore vita integra cum cogitatione, ut perciperem et memoria retinerem ea 
quae contingunt iis qui mortui sunt et resuscitantur, cum vitae conveniente respiratione, dein cum respiratione tacita.    @     1 This paragraph and several of the following will be found repeated more
