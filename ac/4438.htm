<h3 align="center" class="ired">属天的奥秘 第4438节</h3>
<h4 align="center"></h4><p><strong>4438.</strong>创世记34:5-7.雅各听见示剑玷污了他的女儿底拿，那时他的儿子们正和群畜在田野，雅各就沉默，等他们回来。示剑的父亲哈抹出来，到雅各那里，要和他讲话。雅各的儿子们听见这事，就从田野回来，人人痛心，极其恼怒，因示剑在以色列中作了丑事，与雅各的女儿同寝，这本是不应该作的。<br />“雅各听见示剑玷污了他的女儿底拿”表不合法的结合，“雅各”在此是指外在的古教会。“那时他的儿子们正和群畜在田野”表他的后代，他们陷入自己的宗教表象。“雅各就沉默，等他们回来”表与他及其后代所知的信之真理商议。“示剑的父亲哈抹出来，到雅各那里，要和他讲话”表商议这个教会的真理。“雅各的儿子们就从田野回来”表他们基于其宗教表象进行商议。“听见这事，人人痛心，极其恼怒”表他们陷入反对古人当中的教会真理的邪恶。“因示剑在以色列中作了丑事，与雅各的女儿同寝，这本是不应该作的”表在他们眼里不合法的结合，违背了他们所拥有的真理。</p>

Verses 5-7. And Jacob heard that he had defiled Dinah his daughter; and his sons were with his acquisition in the field; and Jacob was silent until they came. And Hamor the father of Shechem went out 
unto Jacob to speak with him. And the sons of Jacob came from the field as they heard it, and the men were grieved, and they were very angry, because he had wrought folly in Israel, in lying with Jacob's 
daughter, and so it ought not to be done. "And Jacob heard that he had defiled Dinah his daughter," signifies a conjunction not legitimate ("Jacob" here is the external Ancient Church); "and his 
sons were with his acquisition in the field," signifies his descendants - that they were in their religiosity; "and Jacob was silent until they came," signifies a consultation from the truths of faith 
that belonged to him and his descendants; "and Hamor the father of Shechem went out unto Jacob to speak with him," signifies a consultation about the truth of that church; "and the sons of Jacob came 
from the field," signifies that they consulted from their religiosity; "and the men were grieved, and they were very angry," signifies that they were in evil against the truth of the Church among the 
Ancients; "because he had wrought folly in Israel, in lying with Jacob's daughter, and so it ought not to be done," signifies a conjunction that was unlawful in their eyes, because contrary to the truth 
which they had. </p>

Verses 5-7 And Jacob heard that he had defiled Dinah his daughter; and his sons were with his cattle in the field; and Jacob kept silent until they came. And Hamor, Shechem's father, went out to Jacob 
to speak to him. And Jacob's sons came from the field when they heard; and the men were grieved and blazing with anger, because he had done something disgraceful in Israel by lying with Jacob's daughter, 
a thing that ought not to be done. </p>
<p>'Jacob heard that he had defiled Dinah his daughter' means a wrongful joining together, 'Jacob' here being the external Ancient Church. 'And his sons were with 
his cattle in the field' means that his descendants dwelt in their own semblance of religion. 'And Jacob kept silent until they came' means counsel taken with the truths of faith which were known 
to him and his descendants. 'And Hamor, Shechem's father, went out to Jacob to speak to him' means consultation regarding the truth of that Church. 'And Jacob's sons came from the field' means that the 
counsel they took was based in their semblance of religion. 'When they heard; and the men were grieved and blazing with anger' means that they were under the influence of evil that was directed against 
the truth of the Church among the Ancients. 'Because he had done something disgraceful in Israel by lying with Jacob's daughter, a thing that ought not to be done' means a joining together which in 
their eyes was not permissible, going against the truth which they possessed. </p>

Vers. 5-7.  Et Jacob audivit, quod polluerit Dinam filiam suam; et filii ejus erant cum acquisitione ejus in agro; et tacuit Jacob usque ad venire illos.  Et exivit Hamor pater Shechemi ad Jacobum, 
ad loquendum cum eo.  Et filii Jacobi venerunt ab agro, ut audire illos, et doluerunt viri, et exarsit illis valde, quia stultitiam fecit in Israele ad cubandum cum filia Jacobi, et ita non fiet. 
 `Jacob audivit quod polluerit Dinam filiam suam' significat conjunctionem non legitimam; `Jacob' est hic Antiqua Ecclesia externa: `et filii ejus erant cum acquisitione ejus in agro' significat 
posteros quod in suo religioso essent: `et tacuit Jacob usque ad venire illos' significat consultationem ex veris fidei, quae illi et posteris ejus: `et exivit Hamor pater Shechemi ad Jacobum ad loquendum 
cum eo significat consultationem de vero Ecclesiae illius: `et filii Jacobi venerunt ab agro' significat quod consultaverint ex religioso suo: `ut audire illos, et doluerunt viri, et exarsit 
illis valde' significat quod in malo essent contra verum Ecclesiae apud antiquos: `quia stultitiam fecit in Israele ad cubandum cum filia Jacobi, et ita non fiet' significat conjunctionem in oculis 
illorum illicitam contra verum quod illis. </p>
