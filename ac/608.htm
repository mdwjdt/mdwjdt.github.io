<h3 align="center" class="ired">属天的奥秘 第608节</h3>
<h4 align="center"></h4><p><strong>608.</strong>当内在呼吸停止时，和现今一样的外在呼吸就逐渐替代它。随外在呼吸而来的是有声语言或清晰的声音，它们将构成思想的想法包裹起来。人的状态就这样被彻底改变，他已变得这样，以至于再也无法拥有那种觉察力，取而代之的是另一种不同的指示，这种指示可被称为良知，因为尽管很象良知，但事实上，它是介于觉察和现在有些人所知的良知之间的中间物。一旦构成思想的想法被这样包裹起来，也就是说，被封在有声语言里，人们就无法再象古人那样通过内在人受教，而只能通过外在人受教。因此，继上古教会所受启示而来的，是先被外在感官理解的教义事项，通过教义事项在记忆中产生物质想法，由此再形成构成思想的想法，然后他们藉着并按照有思想的想法接受教导。因此，随后的这个教会拥有完全不同于上古教会的天赋。若非主将人类带入这种天赋，或说这种状态，无人能得救。</p>

<p><strong>[NCE]608.</strong> As internal breathing waned, external breathing almost of the kind we have today gradually replaced it. With external breathing came verbal speech — the speech of articulated sounds. This was now the vehicle for the individual ideas that make up thought.<br />In the process, the human condition changed radically. People could no longer perceive things in the way they had before but, as a substitute for perception, began to hear another kind of inner voice that can be called conscience. It was similar to conscience, although it was more or less a middle ground between perception and the conscience that some people today are familiar with.{*1} When the ideas that make up thought came to be poured into this type of mold — into spoken words, that is — human beings could no longer receive instruction by way of the inner self as the earliest people had but only through the outer self. The revelations of the earliest church gave way to articles of doctrine, which would first be grasped through the physical senses. These physical sensations would be shaped into concrete images in the memory and then reshaped into ideas — the components of thought. The ideas would provide an avenue and a framework for instruction.<br />So it was that this church, which came after the earliest church, had a completely different kind of psyche. Had the Lord not imposed on the human race this new psyche or new approach, no one could ever have been saved.<br /><br /><strong>Footnotes:</strong><br />{*1} In this discussion it is important to remember that conscientia, the Latin word here translated "conscience," can also mean "consciousness."

When internal respiration ceased, external respiration gradually succeeded, almost like that of the present day; and with external respiration a language of words, or of articulate sound into which the 
ideas of thought were determined. Thus the state of man was entirely changed, and became such that he could no longer have similar perception, but instead of perception another kind of dictate which 
may be called conscience, for it was like conscience, though a kind of intermediate between perception and the conscience known to some at this day. And when such determination of the ideas of thought 
took place, that is to say, into spoken words, they could no longer be instructed, like the most ancient man, through the internal man, but through the external. And therefore in place of the revelations 
of the Most Ancient Church, doctrinal things succeeded, which could first be received by the external senses, and from them material ideas of the memory could be formed, and from these, ideas of 
thought, by which and according to which they were instructed. Hence it was that this church which followed possessed an entirely different genius from that of the Most Ancient Church, and if the Lord 
had not brought the human race into this genius, or into this state, no man could have been saved. </p>

When internal breathing came to an end, external breathing practically the same as that today gradually took its place. And with external breathing came vocal speech or articulated sounds, which encapsulated 
the ideas comprising thought. In this way man's state was changed completely, and he became such as to be incapable any longer of possessing perception of that kind. Instead of perception he 
had a different kind of dictate, which may be called conscience, for though similar to conscience, it was in fact something half-way between perception and conscience as some people know it today. And 
once such an encapsulation of the ideas comprising thought had taken place, that is to say, within vocal speech, people could not be taught any longer by way of the internal man, as the most ancient 
people had been, but by way of the external. Consequently the revelations that the Most Ancient Church received were succeeded by matters of doctrine which had first of all to be apprehended by the external 
senses. These would produce material ideas in the memory, from which the ideas comprising thought were formed, such ideas being the means by which they were taught. Consequently the mental constitution 
of this Church was altogether different from that of the Most Ancient Church which it succeeded. And unless the Lord had brought the human race into that mental disposition or condition nobody 
at all could possibly have been saved.  </p>

</p><b>608.</b>
Quando desiit respiratio interna, sensim subiit respiratio externa, qualis fere hodie; et cum respiratione externa loquela vocum, seu soni articulari, in quem determinabantur ideae cogitationis; ita 
mutatus est prorsus status hominis et talis factus ut non amplius perceptionem similem potuisset habere, sed loco perceptionis aliud quoddam dictamen quod vocari potest conscientia, nam conscientiae 
simile erat, tametsi quoddam intermedium inter perceptionem et conscientiam hodie quibusdam notam.  Cumque talis determinatio idearum cogitationis facta, nempe in voces loquelae, tunc nec amplius potuerunt 
instrui ita per internum hominem ut homo antiquissimus, sed per externum; quare tunc loco revelationum Antiquissimae Ecclesiae successerunt doctrinalia, quae sensibus externis primum caperentur, 
ex quibus ideae memoriae materiales et inde ideae cogitationis formarentur, per quas et secundum quas instruebantur: inde luit quod haec Ecclesia quae successit, prorsus alium genium habuit quam Antiquissima; 
in quem genium, seu in quem statum, nisi Dominus redegisset genus humanum, nusquam aliquis homo salvari potuisset. </p>
