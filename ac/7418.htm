<h3 align="center" class="ired">属天的奥秘 第7418节</h3>
<h4 align="center"></h4><p><strong>7418.</strong>“击打地上的尘土”表他要移除属世层中那些被诅咒的事物。这从“击打”、“尘土”和“地”的含义清楚可知：“击打”是指移除；“尘土”是指被诅咒的事物，如下文所述；“地”，此处即埃及，是指属世心智（<a href="7409.htm">7409</a>节）。“尘土”之所以表示被诅咒的事物，是因为恶灵所在的地方，在脚底之下的边缘，看似一块地；事实上，看似一块未耕种的干旱之地；确切地说，它们下面有一些地狱。这地被称为“诅咒之地”，那里的尘土表示被诅咒之物。有时我蒙恩得以看见当恶灵想给某人诅咒时，就在那里跺下脚上的尘土。我看见他们在朝向术士或巫师地狱的边缘处，在我前面稍右的一个位置做这一切；在那里，那些活在世上时拥有信的知识，然而却过着一种邪恶生活的灵人被投入地狱。这就是为何“尘土”表示被诅咒之物，“跺下尘土”表示诅咒。<br />由于它具有这种含义，所以主吩咐祂的门徒们，他们若不受接待，就将脚上的尘土跺下去，正如马太福音所说的：<br />凡不接待你们、不听你们话的人，你们离开那家或是那城的时候，就把脚上的尘土跺下去。我实在告诉你们：当审判的日子，所多玛和蛾摩拉那地所受的，比那城还容易受呢！（马太福音<a href="http://39-27.cn/太10.14.htm">10:14</a>-<a href="http://39-27.cn/太10.15.htm">15</a>；马可福音<a href="http://39-27.cn/可6.11.htm">6:11</a>；路加福音<a href="http://39-27.cn/路9.5.htm">9:5</a>；<a href="http://39-27.cn/路10.10.htm">10:10</a>-<a href="http://39-27.cn/路10.12.htm">12</a>）<br />“门徒”在此不是指门徒，而是指教会的一切事物，因而是指信与仁的一切事物（<a href="2089.htm">2089</a>，<a href="2129.htm">2129</a>，<a href="2130.htm">2130</a>e，<a href="3354.htm">3354</a>，<a href="3858.htm">3858</a>，<a href="3913.htm">3913</a>，<a href="6397.htm">6397</a>节）；“不接受，不听”表示弃绝信之真理和仁之良善；“把脚上的尘土跺下去”表示诅咒。之所以“所多玛和蛾摩拉所受的，比那城还容易受呢”，是因为“所多玛和蛾摩拉”表示那些过着邪恶生活，但对主和圣言一无所知，因而不能接待的人。由此可见，所指的不是不接待门徒的一家或一城，而是指那些在教会中没有过着信之生活的人。谁都能看出，一整座城不可能因他们不接待门徒，并立刻接受门徒所传讲的新教义，就都受到诅咒。<br />在以前的时代，人们在悲伤或悔罪时扬在头上的“尘土”也表示受到诅咒，如这些经文：<br />锡安女子的长老，坐在地上默默无声，他们扬起尘土落在头上，腰束麻布；耶路撒冷的处女，垂头至地。（耶利米哀歌<a href="http://39-27.cn/哀2.10.htm">2:10</a>）<br />以西结书：<br />他们必放声痛哭，把尘土撒在头上，在灰中打滚。（以西结书<a href="http://39-27.cn/结27.30.htm">27:30</a>）<br />弥迦书：<br />不要在亚弗拉家里哭泣；滚于灰尘之中。（弥迦书<a href="http://39-27.cn/弥1.10.htm">1:10</a>）<br />启示录：<br />他们又把尘土撒在头上，哭泣悲哀，喊着说。（启示录<a href="http://39-27.cn/启18.19.htm">18:19</a>）<br />这些行为在圣言的历史部分处处提及。把尘土撒在头上，以及身体和头垂至地面，在地上滚于灰尘之中代表谦卑；真正的谦卑是这样：此人会承认并发觉自己受到了诅咒，然而又被主从诅咒中救了出来（<a href="2327.htm">2327</a>，<a href="3994.htm">3994</a>，<a href="4347.htm">4347</a>，<a href="5420.htm">5420</a>，<a href="5957.htm">5957</a>节）。<br />“尘土”<br />他们在旷野中所祷的金牛犊被捣碎磨成的“灰尘”也表示被诅咒之物，对此我们在摩西五经中如此读到：<br />我把那叫你们犯罪所铸的牛犊用火焚烧，又捣碎磨得很细，以致细如灰尘，我就把这灰尘撒在从山上流下来的溪水中。（申命记<a href="http://39-27.cn/申9.21.htm">9:21</a>）<br />在以下经文中，“灰尘”也表示被诅咒之物：<br />耶和华神对蛇说，你必用肚子行走，尽你一生的日子吃土。（创世记<a href="http://39-27.cn/创3.14.htm">3:14</a>）<br />弥迦书：<br />在往古之日牧放你的民，列族看见，就必为自己的势力惭愧。他们必舔土如蛇。（弥迦书<a href="http://39-27.cn/弥7.14.htm">7:14</a>，<a href="http://39-27.cn/弥7.16.htm">16</a>-<a href="http://39-27.cn/弥7.17.htm">17</a>）<br />以赛亚书：<br />尘土必作蛇的食物。（以赛亚书<a href="http://39-27.cn/赛65.25.htm">65:25</a>）<br /><br />巴比伦的处女啊，下来坐在尘埃。（以赛亚书<a href="http://39-27.cn/赛47.1.htm">47:1</a>）<br />诗篇：<br />我们的灵魂伏于尘土；我们的肚腹紧贴在地。（诗篇<a href="http://39-27.cn/诗44.25.htm">44:25</a>）<br /><br />我的灵魂紧贴着尘土，求你将我救活。（诗篇<a href="http://39-27.cn/诗119.25.htm">119:25</a>）<br />在圣言中，“尘土”也表示坟墓，同样表示低级之物和众多之物。</p>

<p align="center"><b>Potts(1905-1910) 7418</b></p><p><b>7418.</b>
And smite the dust of the land. That this signifies that he should remove the things in the natural that had been damned, is evident from the signification of "smiting," as being to remove; from the 
signification of "dust," as being that which is damned (of which in what follows); and from the signification of "the land," here the land of Egypt, as being the natural mind (n. 7409). That "dust" denotes 
that which is damned is because the places where evil spirits are, at the sides beneath the soles of the feet, appear as land, and in fact as land untilled and dry, under which are certain hells. 
This land is called "damned land," and the dust there signifies that which is damned. It has sometimes been granted me to see that the evil spirits shook off the dust there from their feet, when they 
desired to give anyone to damnation. This was seen to the right a little in front, in the border toward the hell of the magicians, where spirits are cast into their hell who during their life in the 
world have been in the knowledge of faith, and yet have led a life of evil. From this then it is that by "dust" is signified what is damned, and by "shaking off the dust" damnation. [2] It was from 
this signification that the Lord commanded His disciples to shake off the dust of their feet if they were not received, as in Matthew: </p>
<p>     Whosoever shall not receive you, nor hear your words, when 
ye depart out of that house or city, shake off the dust of your feet. Verily I say to you, it shall be more tolerable for the land of Sodom and Gomorrah in the day of judgment, than for that city (Matt. 
10:14-15; Mark 6:11; Luke 9:5; 10:10-12); </p>
<p>by the "disciples" here are not meant disciples, but all things of the church, thus all things of faith and charity (n. 2089, 2129, 2130, 3354, 3858, 3913, 
6397); by "not receiving, and not hearing," is signified to reject the truths of faith and the goods of charity; and by "shaking off the dust of the feet," damnation. That "it would be more tolerable 
for Sodom and Gomorrah than for that city," is because by "Sodom and Gomorrah" are meant those who are in evil of life, but who have known nothing of the Lord and the Word, and thus could not receive. 
From this it can be seen that there is not meant a house or city which would not receive the disciples, but those who are within the church and do not live the life of faith. Everyone can see that 
a whole city could not be damned because they did not receive the disciples and at once acknowledge the new doctrine which they preached.  [3] By the "dust" also which was formerly put on the head when 
in grief and repentance, is signified that which is damned, as in these passages: </p>
<p>     The elders of the daughter of Zion sit on the earth, they keep silence; they have made dust come up upon their 
head; they have girded themselves with sackcloth; the virgins of Jerusalem have made their head come down to the earth (Lam. 2:10).      They shall cry bitterly, and shall make dust come up upon their 
heads, they shall roll themselves in the ashes (Ezek. 27:30).      Weeping weep not in the house of Aphrah; roll thyself in the dust (Micah 1:10).      They cast dust on their heads, and cried, 
weeping and wailing (Rev. 18:19); </p>
<p>and also in the historical parts of the Word throughout. By dust upon the heads, and also by the casting down of the body and of the head to the earth, and there rolling 
in the dust, was represented humiliation, which when genuine is such that the person acknowledges and perceives himself to be damned, but to be received from damnation by the Lord (n. 2327, 3994, 
4347, 5420, 5957). [4] By the "dust" into which the golden calf which they made in the wilderness was beaten and ground, is also signified what is damned, of which we read thus in Moses: </p>
<p>     I took 
your sin, the calf which ye had made, and burnt it with fire and I beat it, grinding it well, even until it was reduced unto dust; and I cast the dust thereof into the brook that descended out of the 
mountain (Deut. 9:21). By "dust" is also signified what is damned in the following passages: </p>
<p>     Jehovah God said unto the serpent, Upon thy belly shalt thou walk, and dust shalt thou eat all the 
days of thy life (Gen. 3:14).      Feed Thy people as in the days of eternity, the nations shall see, and blush at all their power, they shall lick the dust like a serpent (Micah 7:14, 16-17).     
 Dust shall be the serpent's meat (Isa. 65:25).      Come down, and sit upon the dust, O virgin daughter of Babel (Isa. 47:1).      Our soul is bowed down to the dust, our belly hath cleaved to the 
earth (Ps. 44:25).      My soul cleaveth to the dust, quicken Thou me (Ps. 119:25). "Dust" in the Word signifies also the grave, likewise what is lowly, and what is numerous. </p>

<p align="center"><b>Elliott(1983-1999) 7418</b></p><p><b>7418.</b>
'And strike the dust of the land' means that he should remove those things in the natural which are damned. This is clear from the meaning of 'striking' as removing; from the meaning of 'the dust' as 
that which is damned, dealt with below; and from the meaning of 'the land', at this point the land of Egypt, as the natural mind, dealt with above in <a href="7409.htm">7409</a>. The reason why 'the dust' means that which 
is damned is that the places on the fringes below the soles of the feet, where evil spirits are, look like a land. They look like an uncultivated and dry land, to be exact, below which there are certain 
kinds of hells. That land is what is called the damned land, and the dust there serves to mean that which is damned. I have been allowed on several occasions to see evil spirits shaking off the dust 
there from their feet when they wished to consign someone to damnation. I saw them doing this in a position on the right slightly in front of me, on the borders of the hell of magicians, where spirits 
who during their life in the world have possessed a knowledge of matters of belief, but have nevertheless led a life of evil, are cast down into the hell that is theirs. This then is why 'the dust' 
means that which is damned, and 'shaking off the dust' damnation. </p>
<p></p>
<p><b>[2]</b>
 Since it had that meaning the Lord commanded the disciples to shake off the dust on their feet if they were not well received. 
What He said about this appears in Matthew as follows,  </p>
<blockquote>
If anyone will not receive you or listen to your words, as you leave that house or city, shake off the dust on your feet. Truly I say to you, 
It will be more tolerable for the land of Sodom and Gomorrah on the day of judgement than for that city. <a href="http://bible.gospelcom.net/cgi-bin/bible?passage=Matt%2010:14,%2015&amp;version=ESV&amp;interface=print&amp;showfn=yes&amp;showxref">Matt 10:14, 15</a>; <a href="http://bible.gospelcom.net/cgi-bin/bible?passage=Mark%206:11&amp;version=ESV&amp;interface=print&amp;showfn=yes&amp;showxref">Mark 6:11</a>; <a href="http://bible.gospelcom.net/cgi-bin/bible?passage=Luke%209:5,%2010:10-12&amp;version=ESV&amp;interface=print&amp;showfn=yes&amp;showxref">Luke 9:5, 10:10-12</a>. 
</blockquote>
<p>Here the disciples are not meant by the disciples 
but all aspects of the Church, thus all aspects of faith and charity, <a href="2089.htm">2089</a>, <a href="2129.htm">2129</a> (end), <a href="2130.htm">2130</a> (end), <a href="3354.htm">3354</a>, <a href="3858.htm">3858</a>, <a href="3913.htm">3913</a>, <a href="6397.htm">6397</a>. 'Not receiving' and not listening to' mean rejecting the truths of faith 
and forms of the good of charity, while shaking off the dust on their feet' means damnation. And the reason why 'it will be more tolerable for Sodom and Gomorrah than that city' is that 'Sodom and 
Gomorrah' is used to mean those who lead a life of evil but have known nothing about the Lord and the Word, and so could not be receptive. From this it may become clear that a house or a city unreceptive 
of the disciples is not meant, but those who though they are within the Church do not lead the life of faith. Anyone may see that an entire city could not be damned for not receiving the disciples 
and instantly accepting the new teaching proclaimed by them. </p>
<p></p>
<p><b>[3]</b>
 That which is damned is also meant by 'the dust' which people in former times placed on their heads in grief or when penitent, as 
in Jeremiah,  </p>
<blockquote>
The elders of the daughter of Zion sit on the ground, they are silent; they have caused dust to come up over their heads, they have girded themselves with sackcloth; the virgins of Jerusalem 
have caused their heads to come down to the ground. <a href="http://bible.gospelcom.net/cgi-bin/bible?passage=Lam%202:10&amp;version=ESV&amp;interface=print&amp;showfn=yes&amp;showxref">Lam 2:10</a>. 
</blockquote>
<p>In Ezekiel, </p>
<blockquote>
They will cry out bitterly, and will cause dust to come up over their heads; they roll themselves in ashes. <a href="http://bible.gospelcom.net/cgi-bin/bible?passage=Ezek%2027:30&amp;version=ESV&amp;interface=print&amp;showfn=yes&amp;showxref">Ezek 27:30</a>. 
</blockquote>
<p>In Micah, </p>
<blockquote>
Do not weep at all in the house of Aphrah; roll yourself in the dust. <a href="http://bible.gospelcom.net/cgi-bin/bible?passage=Micah%201:10&amp;version=ESV&amp;interface=print&amp;showfn=yes&amp;showxref">Micah 1:10</a>. 
</blockquote>
<p>In John, </p>
<blockquote>
They threw dust onto their heads, and cried out, weeping and wailing. <a href="http://bible.gospelcom.net/cgi-bin/bible?passage=Rev%2018:19&amp;version=ESV&amp;interface=print&amp;showfn=yes&amp;showxref">Rev 18:19</a>. 
</blockquote>
<p>The 
same actions are referred to throughout the historical narratives of the Word. Casting dust over the head, prostrating body and head on the ground, and rolling over in the dust on it, represented 
self-abasement, which - when it is genuine - is such that the person acknowledges and perceives that he is damned, yet is rescued from damnation by the Lord, see <a href="1327.htm">1327</a>, <a href="3994.htm">3994</a>, <a href="4347.htm">4347</a>, <a href="5420.htm">5420</a>, <a href="5957.htm">5957</a>. </p>
<p></p>
<p><b>[4]</b>
The dust' into which the golden calf which they made in the wilderness was crushed and ground down likewise means that which is damned. This is spoken of in Moses as follows, </p>
<blockquote>
I took your sin 
which you had made, the calf, and I burnt it in the fire, and crushed it by grinding it right down until it was as fine as dust; and I threw its dust into the brook descending out of the mountain. 
<a href="http://bible.gospelcom.net/cgi-bin/bible?passage=Deut%209:11&amp;version=ESV&amp;interface=print&amp;showfn=yes&amp;showxref">Deut 9:11</a>. 
</blockquote>
<p>'Dust' again means that which is damned in the following places: In Genesis, </p>
<blockquote>
Jehovah God said to the serpent, On your belly you will go, and dust will you eat all the days of your life. 
<a href="http://bible.gospelcom.net/cgi-bin/bible?passage=Gen%203:14&amp;version=ESV&amp;interface=print&amp;showfn=yes&amp;showxref">Gen 3:14</a>. 
</blockquote>
<p>In Micah, </p>
<blockquote>
Shepherd Your people as in the days of eternity. The nations will see and be ashamed at all their power; they will lick the dust like a serpent. <a href="http://bible.gospelcom.net/cgi-bin/bible?passage=Micah%207:14,%2016,%2017&amp;version=ESV&amp;interface=print&amp;showfn=yes&amp;showxref">Micah 7:14, 16, 17</a>.  
</blockquote>
<p>In 
Isaiah, </p>
<blockquote>
For the serpent, dust will be his bread. <a href="http://bible.gospelcom.net/cgi-bin/bible?passage=Isa%2065:25&amp;version=ESV&amp;interface=print&amp;showfn=yes&amp;showxref">Isa 65:25</a>. 
</blockquote>
<p>In the same prophet, </p>
<blockquote>
Come down and sit in the dust, O virgin daughter of Babel. <a href="http://bible.gospelcom.net/cgi-bin/bible?passage=Isa%2047:1&amp;version=ESV&amp;interface=print&amp;showfn=yes&amp;showxref">Isa 47:1</a>. 
</blockquote>
<p>In David, </p>
<blockquote>
Our soul was bowed down 
to the dust, our belly clung to the earth. <a href="http://bible.gospelcom.net/cgi-bin/bible?passage=Ps%2044:25&amp;version=ESV&amp;interface=print&amp;showfn=yes&amp;showxref">Ps 44:25</a>. 
</blockquote>
<p>In the same author, </p>
<blockquote>
My soul clings to the dust; vivify me. <a href="http://bible.gospelcom.net/cgi-bin/bible?passage=Ps%20119:25&amp;version=ESV&amp;interface=print&amp;showfn=yes&amp;showxref">Ps 119:25</a>. 
</blockquote>
<p>In the Word 'dust' in addition means the grave, as well as that 
which is lowly, and that which is numerous too. </p>

<p align="center"><b>Latin(1748-1756) 7418</b>
</p><b>7418.</b>
`Et percute pulverem terrae': quod significet quod emoveret illa quae damnata sunt in naturali, constat ex significatione `percutere' quod sit emovere; ex significatione `pulveris' quod sit damnatum, 
de qua sequitur; et ex significatione (d)`terrae,' hic `terrae Aegypti,' quod sit mens naturalis, de qua supra n. 7409.  Quod `pulvis' sit damnatum, est quia loca ubi mali spiritus sunt, {1} ad latera 
sub {2}plantis pedum, (x)apparent ut terra, et quidem ut terra inexculta et {3}arida, sub {4}qua terra sunt quaedam inferna; {5}illa terra est quae vocatur terra damnata, et pulvis ibi significat damnatum; 
aliquoties videre datum est quod mali spiritus excuterent ibi pulverem pedibus suis, cum aliquem vellent damnationi dare; hoc visum est ad dextrum paulo antrorsum, in confinio ad infernum magnorum, 
ubi dejiciuntur in infernum suum spiritus qui dum vixerunt in mundo, in scientia fidei fuerunt, et usque vitam mali egerunt; inde nunc est quod per `pulverem' significetur damnatum, et per `excutere 
pulverem' damnatio. 	2 {6} Quia id significabatur, mandatum est a Domino discipulis ut excuterent pulverem pedum, si non exciperentur, de quo ita apud Matthaeum, Quisquis non (x)exceperit vos, 
neque audiverit verba vestra, egredientes e domo aut urbe illa, excutite pulverem pedum vestrorum: amen dico vobis, Tolerabilius erit terrae Sodomae et Gomorrhae in die judicii quam urbi illi, x 14, 
15; Marc. vi 11; Luc. ix 5, x 10-12; </p>
<p>per discipulos ibi non intelliguntur discipuli sed omnia Ecclesiae, ita omnia fidei et charitatis, n. 2089, 2129 fin., 2130 fin., 3354, 3858, 3913, 6397; per `non 
excipere' et `non audire' significatur rejicere vera quae fidei et bona quae charitatis; per `excutere pulverem pedum' significatur damnatio; quod `tolerabilius erit Sodomae et Gomorrhae quam {7} urbi 
illi' est quia per `Sodomam et Gomorrham' intelliguntur illi qui in malo vitae sunt, sed qui {8}de Domino ac de Verbo nihil noverunt, ita nec recipere potuerunt; inde constare potest quod non domus 
aut urbs quae non receptura {9}esset discipulos intelligatur, sed quod {10}illi qui intra Ecclesiam sunt et non vivunt vitam fidei; quisque videre potest quod idcirco tota urbs {11}non damnata esse posset 
quia non receperunt discipulos et ilico agnoverunt novam doctrinam quam praedicabant. 	3 Per `pulverem' etiam significatur damnatum, quem olim imposuerunt {12}capiti cum in dolore et paenitentia 
essent, ut apud Jeremiam, Sedent in terra, tacent seniores filiae zionis, ascendere fecerunt pulverem super caput suum; cinxerunt se saccis, descendere fecerunt in terram caput suum virgines Hierosolymae, 
Threni ii 10: </p>
<p>apud Ezechielem, Clamabunt amare, et ascendere facient pulverem super capita sua; in cinere {13}volutant se, xxvii 30: </p>
<p>apud Micham, Flendo ne fleatis in domo Aphrae, in pulvere 
te voluta, i 10: </p>
<p>apud Johannem, Injecerunt pulverem in capita sua, et clamabant flentes et plangentes, Apoc. xxiii 19; </p>
<p>et quoque in historicis Verbi passim; per `pulverem super capita,' (c)et per 
`dejectionem corporis et capitis in terram,' (c)ac `volutionem ibi in pulvere' repraesentabatur humiliatio, quae cum genuina, talis est ut agnoscat et percipiat se damnatum, sed a damnatione {14}receptum 
a Domino, videatur n. 2327, (x)3994, 4347, 5420, 5957. 	4 Per `pulverem' in quem contusus est et commolitus vitulus aureus, quem fecerunt in deserto, etiam damnatum significatur, de quo ita apud 
Moschen, Peccatum vestrum, quod fecistis, vitulum sumpsi, et combussi illum igne; et contudi illum molendo probe, usque dum attenuatus est in pulverem, et pulverem illius projeci in rivum descendentem 
e monte, Deut. ix 21: </p>
<p>per `pulverem' etiam significatur damnatum in sequentibus locis: in Genesi, Dixit Jehovah Deus ad serpentem, Super ventre tuo ambulabis, et pulverem edes omnibus diebus vitae 
tuae, iii 14: </p>
<p>apud Micham, Pasce populum tuum juxta dies aeternitatis: videbunt gentes, et erubescent ab omni potentia sua; lambent pulverem sicut serpens, vii 14, 16, 17: </p>
<p>apud Esaiam, Serpenti
