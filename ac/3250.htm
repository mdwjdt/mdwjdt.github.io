Verses 7-10. And these are the days of the years of the lives of Abraham, which he lived; a hundred years, and seventy years, and five years. And Abraham expired and died in a good old age, an old man 
and sated, and was gathered to his peoples. And Isaac and Ishmael his sons buried him in the cave of Machpelah, in the field of Ephron the son of Zohar the Hittite, which is before Mamre; the field 
which Abraham purchased of the sons of Heth: there was Abraham buried, and Sarah his wife. "And these are the days of the years of the lives of Abraham, which he lived," signifies the state representative 
by Abraham of the Lord as to the Divine Itself; "a hundred years, and seventy years, and five years," signifies the things that belong to this state; "and Abraham expired and died," signifies the 
end of the representation by Abraham; "in a good old age, an old man and sated," signifies something new in the representation; "and was gathered to his peoples," signifies that these things were concerning 
Abraham; "and Isaac and Ishmael his sons buried him," signifies that the representative of the Lord was now taken up by Isaac and Ishmael; "in the cave of Machpelah," signifies resurrection as 
to truth; "in the field of Ephron the son of Zohar the Hittite, which is before Mamre," signifies as to good; it also signifies the spiritual, as above, who receive truth and good from the Lord's Divine 
Human, and are saved; "the field which Abraham purchased of the sons of Heth," signifies the Lord's spiritual kingdom thence derived; "there was Abraham buried, and Sarah his wife," signifies resuscitation. </p>

Verses 7-10 And these are the days of the years of Abraham's life which he lived, a hundred and seventy-five years. And Abraham breathed his last and died in a good old age, an old man and full [of years]; 
and he was gathered to his peoples. And Isaac and Ishmael his sons buried him at the cave of Machpelah, at the field of Ephron the son of Zohar the Hittite, which faced Mamre. The field which Abraham 
bought from the sons of Heth, there Abraham was buried and Sarah his wife. </p>
<p>'These are the days of the years of Abraham's life which he rived' means the state representative of the Lord as regards 
the Divine itself that was portrayed by means of Abraham. 'A hundred and seventy-five years' means the things constituting that state. 'And Abraham breathed his last and died' means the end of the 
representation portrayed by means of Abraham. 'In a good old age, an old man and full [of years]' means a new state of representation. 'And he was gathered to his peoples' means that these things involving 
Abraham [were completed]. 'And Isaac and Ishmael his sons buried him' means that the representation of the Lord was now taken over by Isaac and Ishmael. 'At the cave of Machpelah' means resurrection 
as regards truth. 'At the field of Ephron the son of Zohar the Hittite, which faced Mamre' means as regards good; also meant, as previously, are those who are spiritual, who receive truth and 
good from the Lord's Divine Human and are saved. 'The field which Abraham bought from the sons of Heth' means the Lord's spiritual kingdom resulting from this. 'There Abraham was buried and Sarah his 
wife' means resurrection. </p>

Vers. 7-10.  Et hi dies annorum vitarum Abrahami, quos vixit, centum anni et septuaginta anni et quinque anni. Et exspiravit et mortuus est Abraham in senectute bona, senex et satur; et collectus ad 
populos suos. Et sepeliverunt eum Jishak et Jishmael filii ejus, ad speluncam Machpelae, ad agrum Ephronis filii Zohar Hittaei, quae super facies Mamre. Agrum, quem emit Abraham ex filiis Heth; ibi sepultus 
Abraham et Sarah uxor ejus. `Hi dies annorum vitarum Abrahami, quos vixit' significat statum repraesentativum Domini quoad Ipsum Divinum, per Abrahamum: `centum anni et septuaginta anni et quinque 
anni' significat illa quae sunt ejus status: `et exspiravit et mortuus est Abraham' significat finem repraesentationis per Abrahamum: `in senectute bona, senex et satur' significat novum repraesentationis: 
`et collectus ad populos suos' significat quod haec de Abrahamo: `et sepeliverunt eum Jishak et Jishmael filii ejus' significat quod exciperet nunc repraesentativum Domini per Jishakum et Jishmaelem: 
`ad speluncam Machpelae' significat resurrectionem quoad verum: `ad agrum Ephronis filii Zohar Hittaei, quae super facies Mamre' significat quoad bonum; etiam significat spirituales, ut prius, 
qui ex Divino Humano Domini recipiunt verum et bonum, et salvantur: `agrum quem emit Abraham ex filiis Heth' significat Domini regnum spirituale inde: `ibi sepultus Abraham et Sarah uxor ejus' significat 
resuscitationem. </p>
