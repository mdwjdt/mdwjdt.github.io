Verses 13-15. And Moses said unto God, Behold I come unto the sons of Israel, and say to them, The God of your fathers hath sent me unto you; and they say to me, What is His name? What shall I say unto 
them? And God said unto Moses, I AM WHO I AM; and He said, Thus shalt thou say to the sons of Israel, I AM hath sent me unto you. And God said further unto Moses, Thus shalt thou say unto the sons 
of Israel, Jehovah the God of your fathers, the God of Abraham, the God of Isaac, and the God of Jacob, hath sent me unto you; this is My name forever, and this is My memorial unto generation and generation. 
"And Moses said unto God," signifies perception from the Divine; "Behold I come unto the sons of Israel," signifies about those who are of the spiritual church; "and say unto them, The God of 
your fathers hath sent me unto you," signifies that the Divine of the Ancient Church will be with those who are of the spiritual church; "and they say to me, What is His name?" signifies His quality; 
"what shall I say unto them?" signifies what answer; "and God said unto Moses," signifies the first instruction; "I AM WHO I AM," signifies the Being and Coming-forth of all things in the universe; "and 
He said, Thus shalt thou say unto the sons of Israel," signifies the second instruction; "I AM hath sent me unto you," signifies that the Divine Coming-forth shall be in that church; "and God said 
further unto Moses, Thus shalt thou say unto the sons of Israel," signifies the third instruction; "Jehovah the God of your fathers," signifies the Divine of the Ancient Church; "the God of Abraham, the 
God of Isaac, and the God of Jacob," signifies the Divine Itself, and the Divine Human, thus the Lord; "hath sent me unto you," signifies that He will be in their church; "this is My name forever," 
signifies that the Divine Human is the quality of the Divine Itself; "and this is My memorial unto generation and generation," signifies that He must be worshiped perpetually. </p>
