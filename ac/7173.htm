<h3 align="center" class="ired">属天的奥秘 第7173节</h3>
<h4 align="center"></h4><p><strong>7173.</strong>一些灵人从天堂获知，水星灵曾被应许他们将看见主。于是，我周围的灵人就问他们，他们是否记得这应许。他们说记得，但不知道这应许是不是以他们不容置疑的方式作出的。就在他们以这种方式彼此交谈时，天堂的太阳向他们显现了。只有那些在至内层或第三层天堂的人才能看见天堂的太阳，也就是主；其他人都只能看见它发出的光，以及月亮（<a href="1529.htm">1529</a>-<a href="1531.htm">1531</a>，<a href="4060.htm">4060</a>节）。一看见这太阳，他们说，这不是主神，因为他们没有看见脸。与此同时，灵人们正互相交谈，但我不知道他们在说什么。这时突然，太阳又出现了，主就在它中间，被太阳的光环围绕。一看到这一幕，水星灵深深谦卑下来，俯伏在地。然后，主也从那太阳里向我们这个星球的灵人显现，他们为人时，曾在世上见过祂。他们所有人，一个接一个，因而许多人依次承认，这是主自己；他们当着所有会众的面承认这一点。那时，主还从太阳中向木星灵显现；他们大声说，这是主自己；当宇宙之神向他们显现时，他们曾在自己的星球见过祂。</p>

Certain spirits knew from heaven that a promise had once been made to the spirits of the earth Mercury that they should see the Lord, and therefore they were asked by the spirits about me whether they 
remembered this promise. They said that they remembered it, but that they did not know whether the promise was of such a nature that they should have no doubt about it. While they were thus talking 
together, the sun of heaven appeared to them. (The sun of heaven, which is the Lord, is seen only by those who are in the inmost or third heaven; all others see the light from it, and also the moon, n. 
1529-1531, 4060.) When the sun was seen, they said that this was not the Lord God, because they saw no face. Meanwhile the spirits were talking together, but I do not know what they said. Then suddenly 
the sun appeared again, and in the midst of it the Lord encompassed with a solar circle. On seeing this, the spirits of Mercury humbled themselves profoundly, and settled down. Then also the Lord 
from the sun was seen by spirits of this earth who when they were men had seen Him in the world; and they all one after another, and thus many in order, confessed that it was the Lord Himself; and this 
they confessed before all the company. Then also the Lord from the sun was seen by the spirits of the planet Jupiter, who said in a plain voice, that it was He Himself whom they had seen on their earth 
when the God of the universe appeared to them. </p>

Some spirits learned from heaven that spirits belonging to Mercury had once been promised that they would see the Lord. They were therefore asked by the spirits around me whether they remembered that 
promise. They said that they did, but that they did not know whether the promise had been made in such a way that they could have no doubts about it. While they were talking in this way to one another 
the Sun of heaven appeared to them (the Sun of heaven, which is the Lord, is seen by none except those in the inmost or third heaven; all others see the light radiated by it, and also the Moon, dealt 
with in <a href="1529.htm">1529</a>-<a href="1531.htm">1531</a>, <a href="4060.htm">4060</a>). After they had seen the Sun they said that this was not the Lord God, because they did not see any face. Meanwhile the spirits were talking to one another, but I do know not 
what they said. Then suddenly the Sun reappeared, with the Lord in the middle of it, encircled by the sun's disc. When they saw this the spirits belonging to Mercury became full of deep humility and 
sank to the ground. The Lord also appeared then out of the Sun to spirits belonging to our own planet who had seen Him in the world while they were living there. These spirits - a long train of them 
- declared one after another that He was the Lord; and they declared it before the whole gathering. The Lord also appeared then out of the Sun to spirits belonging to the planet Jupiter. These said in 
a clear voice that He was the One whom they had seen on their planet when the God of the universe appeared to them. </p>

Quidam spiritus sciebant ex caelo quod spiritibus telluris Mercurii quondam promissum fuerit videre Dominum; quare interrogabantur a spiritibus circum me num recordarentur illius promissi, dicebant 
quod recordentur, sed quod non sciant an ita promissum sit, ut de eo nihil dubii haberent.  {1}Cum ita loquerentur inter se, tune apparuit illis Sol caeli, (Solem caeli, qui est Dominus, {2}non alii vident 
quam qui in intimo seu tertio caelo sunt, reliqui vident lucem inde, et quoque Lunam, de qua n. 1529-1531, 4060); viso Sole dicebant quod hoc non esset Dominus Deus quia faciem non videbant.  At 
interea spiritus inter se loquebantur, sed quid locuti sunt, non scio; subito autem tunc iterum apparuit Sol, et in ejus medio Dominus circumcinctus solari circulo; hoc viso spiritus Mercurii humiliabant 
se profunde, et subsidebant.  Tunc quoque Dominus ex Sole visus est spiritibus hujus telluris qui cum homines fuerunt, Ipsum in mundo viderunt, ex quibus unus post alterum (x)fassi sunt, et sic ordine 
plures, quod Ipse Dominus esset; et hoc fassi sunt coram omni coetu.  Tunc quoque Dominus e Sole visus est spiritibus planetae Jovis, qui manifesta voce dicebant quod Ipse esset Quem in tellure 
sua, cum apparuit illis Deus universi, viderant. 	@1 Cumque$ 	@2 i alioquin$ </p>
