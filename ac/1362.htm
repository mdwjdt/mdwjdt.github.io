<h4 align="center"></h4><p><strong>1362.</strong>前面说过，他拉是拿鹤的儿子，也是以他命名并作为祖先的一个民族，他表偶像崇拜。他拉是一个民族，这可从以下事实看出来：源自他儿子的各民族都承认他为其祖先，就象雅各的子孙，或犹太人和以色列人，以及以实玛利人、米甸人等承认亚伯拉罕，摩押人和亚扪人承认罗得一样。尽管这些民族没有以他们，而是以他们的儿子命名，但当所有人都承认一个共同的祖先，并称自己为他的子孙时，如他拉的子孙、亚伯拉罕的子孙，或罗得的子孙，从某种意义上说，这些人就各表一个民族，如此处的他拉、亚伯兰、拿鹤、罗得。因为他们是这些民族的出身或根。雅各的后代也一样，他们全都以雅各的十二个儿子命名，然而仍被叫做雅各和以色列，以及亚伯拉罕的种和子孙（约翰福音<a href="http://39-27.cn/约8.33.htm">8:33</a>，<a href="http://39-27.cn/约8.39.htm">39</a>）。</p>

<p><strong>[NCE]1362.</strong> Terah was a son of Nahor, and Terah was also a nation named after its forefather Terah; he symbolizes idolatrous worship. This was shown earlier [<a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_1362/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_1353" target=_top>1353-1357</a>].<br />The fact that Terah was a nation can be seen from the acknowledgment by the nations springing from his sons that he was their ancestor. This is what Jacob's offspring — the Judeans and Israelites — did, just as the Ishmaelites, Midianites, and others acknowledged Abram, and just as the Moabites and Ammonites acknowledged Lot. Admittedly, those nations were named not for these ancestors but for the ancestors' children. But still when all the people acknowledge a common ancestor and call themselves that ancestor's offspring (the children of Terah, for instance, or the children of Abraham, or the children of Lot), each of the ancestors symbolizes a nation in a broad sense. That is what Terah, Abram, Nahor, and Lot symbolize here, since they are the trunks or roots of various nations. The case is similar with Jacob's offspring; all of them were named for his twelve sons, yet they are still called Jacob and Israel. They are also called the seed and children of Abraham (<a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_1362/bible_king-james-version_john_8_33" target=_top>John 8:33</a>, <a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_1362/bible_king-james-version_john_8_39" target=_top>39</a>). </p>

That Terah was the son of Nahor, and also a nation named from him as its father, and that by him is signified idolatrous worship, has been shown before. That Terah was a nation, may be seen from the 
fact that the nations which originated from his sons acknowledged him as their father, just as the sons of Jacob, or the Jews and Israelites, and also the Ishmaelites, Midianites, and others, acknowledged 
Abraham; and the Moabites and Ammonites acknowledged Lot. Although these nations were not named from them, but from their sons, yet when all acknowledge a common father and call themselves his sons-as 
the sons of Terah, the sons of Abraham, or the sons of Lot-in a general sense a nation is signified by each one of these, as here by Terah, by Abram, by Nahor, and by Lot; for they are the stocks 
or roots of the nations. So with the descendants of Jacob, who were all named from his twelve sons, and yet were called Jacob and Israel, as also the seed and the sons of Abraham (John 8:33, 39). </p>

That Terah was the son of Nahor, and also a nation that was named after him as its forefather, and that he means idolatrous worship, has been shown already. The fact that Terah was a nation becomes clear 
from the consideration that nations arising from his sons acknowledged him as their forefather, just as the sons of Jacob - that is, the Jews and Israelites - and also the Ishmaelites, Midianites, 
and others, acknowledged Abram as theirs and as the Moabites and Ammonites acknowledged Lot. Although these nations were not named after those forefathers, but after their sons, nevertheless when all 
acknowledge a common forefather and call themselves his sons - for example, the sons of Terah, or the sons of Abraham, or the sons of Lot - a nation is meant in a general sense by each one, as also 
here by Terah, Abram, Nahor, and Lot, because they are the stocks or roots of nations. The same was true of the descendants of Jacob who were all named after his twelve sons, but are nevertheless called 
Jacob and Israel, as well as the seed and the sons of Abraham, <a href="http://bible.gospelcom.net/cgi-bin/bible?passage=John%208:33,%2039&amp;version=ESV&amp;interface=print&amp;showfn=yes&amp;showxref">John 8:33, 39</a>. </p>

</p><b>1362.</b>
Quod 'Terahus' fuerit filius Nahoris et quoque gens ab illo ut a suo patre nominata et quod per illum significetur cultus idololatricus, prius ostensum est:  quod Terahus fuerit gens, inde constare 
potest quod gentes ex filiis ejus oriundae illum agnoverint ut suum patrem; sicut etiam filii Jacobi seu Judaei, et Israelitae, tum Ismaelitae, Midianitae et alii, Abramum; Moabitae et Ammonitae Lotum; 
quae gentes tametsi non ab illis sed a filiis eorum nominatae, usque tamen quando omnes agnoscunt communem patrem, seque vocant filios {1}ejus, ut filios Terahi, seu filios Abrahami, seu filios Loti; 
per unumquemque eorum significatur gens in communi sensu, ita hic per Terahum, Abramum, Nahorem et Lotum, sunt enim gentium stirpes seu radices: sicut posteri Jacobi quorum omnes a duodecim filiis ejus 
nominati sunt, sed usque vocantur Jacob et Israel; tum quoque semen et filii Abrahami, Joh. viii 33, 39. @1 eorum I.$ </p>
