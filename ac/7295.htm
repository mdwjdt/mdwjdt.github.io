<h3 align="center" class="ired">属天的奥秘 第7295节</h3>
<h4 align="center"></h4><p><strong>7295.</strong>“亚伦把杖丢在法老和他臣仆面前，杖就变作水蛇”表纯粹的幻觉和衍生的虚假在他们当中掌权。这从“丢杖”和“水蛇”的含义，以及“法老和他臣仆”的代表清楚可知：“丢杖”是指展示能力，如刚才所述（<a href="7292.htm">7292</a>节）；“法老和他臣仆”是指那些通过虚假进行侵扰的人；“水蛇”是指幻觉和由此产生的虚假，如刚才所述（<a href="7293.htm">7293</a>节）。<br />这奇事表示为使那些进行侵扰的人停止而给予他们的第一次警告。在来世，侵扰正直人的恶人，其情况是这样：当从世界初到来世时，他们有良善和天使附着在他们身上，如他们作为世人活在肉身中时的情形；因为那时甚至连恶人也有天使与他们同在，以便他们若愿意，仍能转向天堂，接受天堂的流注，从而得以改造。正是由于这个原因，生命的一切都随他们进入来世；一开始，他们与天使在一起。但由于他们因在世所过的生活而具有这样的性质，他们无法接受来自天堂的真理和良善的流注，所以天使和善灵逐渐离他们；随着他们离开，这些人变得越来越不理性；因为变得理性的能力经由天堂来自主。<br />除去并剥夺真理与良善的流注的第一个阶段由此处亚伦的杖变成蛇来描述，以此表示纯粹的幻觉和由此产生的虚假将掌权。第二个阶段由埃及的水变作血来描述，以此表示真理本身被歪曲。第三个阶段由水中爬出的青蛙来描述，以此表示基于纯粹虚假的推理等等。在来世，恶人也是通过这些阶段被剥夺对真理和良善的理解。</p>

<p align="center"><b>Potts(1905-1910) 7295</b></p><p><b>7295.</b>
And Aaron cast his rod before Pharaoh and before his servants, and it became a water-serpent. That this signifies that mere fallacies and the derivative falsities would reign among them, is evident from 
the signification of "casting a rod," as being to show power (of which just above, n. 7292); from the representation of Pharaoh and his servants, as being those who infest by falsities; and from the 
signification of "water-serpents," as being fallacies and the consequent falsities (of which also just above, n. 7293). [2] This prophetic sign signifies the first warning to desist given to those 
who infest. For when the evil who in the other life infest the upright, first come there from the world, they have good spirits and angels adjoined to them, as when they lived as men in the body; for 
even evil men have also angels with them, in order that they may be able, if they will, to turn themselves to heaven, and to receive influx thence and be reformed. It is for this reason (everything of 
the life following them) that at first they are associated with angels. But when from their life in the world they are such that they cannot receive the influx of truth and good from heaven, then the 
angels and good spirits gradually recede from them; and as these recede, they become less and less rational; for to be rational comes through heaven from the Lord. [3] The first degree of the taking 
away and deprivation of the influx of truth and good is here described by the rod of Aaron being turned into a serpent, whereby is signified that mere fallacies would reign, and the falsities thence 
derived. The second degree is described by the waters of Egypt being turned into blood, whereby is signified that truths themselves were falsified. The third degree is that from the waters there crept 
forth frogs, whereby are signified reasonings from mere falsities; and so on. By such degrees also are the evil in the other life deprived of the understanding of truth and good. </p>

'And Aaron threw down his rod in front of Pharaoh and his servants, and it was made into a water-serpent' means that sheer illusions and resulting falsities reigned among them. This is clear from the 
meaning of 'throwing down the rod' as demonstrating power, dealt with just above in <a href="7292.htm">7292</a>; from the representation of 'Pharaoh and his servants' as those who molest by means of falsities; and from the 
meaning of 'a water-serpent' as illusions and resulting falsities, dealt with just above in <a href="7293.htm">7293</a>. </p>
<p></p>
<p><b>[2]</b>
 This wonder means the first warning given to those who molest to leave off. The situation with 
the evil who molest the upright in the next life is this: When they first enter that life from the world they have good spirits and angels attached to them, as they did when they were people living in 
the body; for even wicked people also have angels present with them, the reason being that they are then able to turn, if they will, towards heaven, receive what flows in from there, and be reformed. 
Consequently, since their life in its entirety follows them into the next life, they live initially in association with angels. But as they are by nature such, because of the life they led in the world, 
that they cannot receive the inflow of truth and goodness from heaven, the angels and good spirits then gradually depart from them. And as these depart, those people become less and less rational. 
For the ability to be rational comes from the Lord by way of heaven. </p>
<p></p>
<p><b>[3]</b>
 The first stage in the removal and deprivation of the inflow of truth and goodness is what is described here by Aaron's rod 
being turned into a serpent, meaning that sheer illusions would reign, and falsities resulting from them. The second stage is described by the waters of Egypt being turned into blood, meaning that actual 
truths were falsified. The third stage is that of the frogs which crawled out of the waters, meaning reasonings based on utter falsities, and so on. By such stages too the evil in the next life 
are deprived of their understanding of what is true and good. </p>

`Et projecit Aharon baculum suum coram Pharaone et servis ejus, et factus in serpentem aqueum': quod significet quod merae fallaciae et inde falsa regnarent apud illos, constat ex significatione `projicere 
baculum' quod sit ostendere potentiam, de qua mox supra n. 7292; ex repraesentatione `Pharaonis et servorum illius' quod sint qui per falsa infestant {1}; et ex significatione `(x)serpentis aquei' 
quod sint {2} fallaciae et inde falsa, de qua {3} mox supra n. 7293. 	2 Hoc prodigium significat primam admonitionem apud illos qui infestant, ut desistant; cum malis enim qui in altera vita infestant 
probos, ita se habet: primum cum illuc e mundo veniunt, habent sibi adjunctos spiritus bonos et {4} angelos sicut cum vixerunt homines in corpore, nam homines etiam mali habent quoque angelos {5} 
apud se, ex causa ut possint, si velint, vertere se ad caelum, et recipere influxum {6}inde, et reformari; inde est, {7}quia omne vitae sequitur, quod primum associati sint angelis; sed cum tales sunt 
ex vita in mundo, ut recipere influxum veri et boni e caelo non possint, tunc angeli et spiritus boni per gradus ab illis recedunt; et sicut illi recedunt, ita minus et minus rationales fiunt; {8}rationales 
enim esse est per 3 caelum a Domino; primus gradus ablationis {9}et deprivationis influxus veri et boni est qui hic describitur per `baculum Aharonis versum in serpentem,' per quod significatur 
quod merae fallaciae regnarent, et inde falsa; secundus gradus describitur per `aquas Aegypti versas in sanguinem,' per quod significatur quod ipsa vera falsificata sint; tertius gradus est quod 
`ex aquis prorepserint ranae,' {10}per quod significantur ratiocinia ex meris falsis, et sic porro; per tales etiam gradus mali in altera vita deprivantur {11}intellectu veri et boni. 	@1 i, de qua prius$ 	@2
