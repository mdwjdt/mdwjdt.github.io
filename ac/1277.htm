<h3 align="center" class="ired">属天的奥秘 第1277节</h3>
<h4 align="center"></h4><p><strong>1277.</strong>世人就灵魂而言也一样，因为灵魂通常与灵人或天使的某个社群相联。在主的国，世人也有一个定位，这定位取决于其生命和状态的性质。他们在世上彼此的距离则无关紧要，哪怕相隔千里之遥，他们仍能处于同一个社群：那些生活在仁爱中的人在天使社群，而那些生活在仇恨及类似罪恶中的人则生活在地狱社群。同样，世上很多人生活在同一地方也没什么用，他们仍照其生命和状态的性质而各不相同，彼此分离，各自所在的社群可能与其他人的不同。若用内在意义上的眼睛来看，彼此相距成百上千里的人可能非常亲近，以致其中一些人根据他们的位置而彼此有所接触。因此，若世上很多人的内在视觉被打开，他们有可能在一起，并共同交谈，尽管一个在印度，另一个在欧洲，这一幕也曾向我显明。所以，世上的所有人，无论总体还是个体，都与主密切同在，呈现在祂的视野和圣治之下。</p>

<p><strong>[NCE]1277.</strong> The case is similar with people on earth in regard to their souls, which are always tied to some community of spirits and angels. We on earth have a position in the Lord's kingdom too, and it likewise depends on the character of our life and on our state. It makes not the slightest difference whether some of us are far apart on the planet, even if the distance is many thousands of miles; we can still be together in the same community. If we exercise kindness in our lives, we are in an angelic community. If we fill our lives with hatred and similar qualities, we are in a hellish community.<br />Similarly, it does not matter in the least if a large number of us live together in one place on earth; all of us are still individuals when it comes to the character of our lives and our state of mind, and each of us can be in a different spiritual community.<br />When people who are several hundred or several thousand miles apart appear before the inner senses, they can be so close (depending on their spiritual location) that they sometimes touch. As a result, if several people were to have their inner eyes opened on earth, they could congregate and talk together, even if one were in India and another in Europe. This has even been demonstrated to me. So each and every person on earth is immediately present to the Lord, directly under his eyes and his loving care. </p>

The case is the very same with men, as to their souls, which are constantly bound to some society of spirits and of angels. They too have a situation in the kingdom of the Lord according to the nature 
of their life, and according to their state. It matters not that they are distant from each other on earth even though it were many thousands of miles-still they can be together in the same society-those 
who live in charity in an angelic society, and those who live in hatred and such evils in an infernal society. In like manner it matters not that there be many together on earth in one place, for 
still they are all distinct in accordance with the nature of their life and of their state, and each one may be in a different society. Men who are distant from each other some hundreds or thousands 
of miles, when they appear to the internal sense may be so near each other that some of them may touch, according to their situation. Thus if there were a number of persons on earth whose spiritual sight 
was opened, they might be together and converse together, though one was in India and another in Europe, which also has been shown me. Thus are all men on earth, both generally and individually, 
most closely present to the Lord, and under His view and providence. </p>

<p align="center"><b>Elliott(1983-1999) 1277</b></p><p><b>1277.</b>
The same applies to men as regards their souls, which are linked constantly to some community of spirits or angels. Men too have a position in the Lord's kingdom that is determined by the nature of their 
life and by their states. The fact that on earth men are distant from one another makes no difference at all. Even though many thousands of miles should separate them, they can still be present together 
in one community- those who live in charity in one angelic community, those who live in hatred and the like in one community in hell. Nor in like manner does the fact that many people on earth 
exist together in the same place make any difference - they are still all distinct and separate according to the nature of their life and of their states, each one possibly in a different community from 
the rest. When people who are several hundreds or thousands of miles distant from one another are seen with the eyes of internal sense they are so close that some are in a position to touch one another. 
Thus if a number of people existed on earth whose internal sight was open they would be able to be together and talk together even though one was in India and another in Europe, as I have also 
been shown. So every single person on earth is very present with the Lord, beneath His view and Providence. </p>

</p><b>1277.</b>
Similiter se habet cum hominibus, quoad eorum animas, quae jugiter vinctae sunt alicui societati spirituum et angelorum; ii quoque situm habent in regno Domini secundum indolem eorum vitae et secundum 
status; nec quicquam facit quod iD tellure distent, etiamsi foret per plura millia milliarium, usque simul possunt esse in una societate; qui in charitate vivunt, in una societate angelica; qui in 
odiis et talibus, in una societate infernali: similiter nec quicquam facit quod in uno loco simul sint plures in tellure, usque sunt omnes distincti secundum indoles vitae eorum et status, et quisque 
potest in alia societate esse. Homines qui distant aliquot centum aut mille milliaribus, cum apparent coram sensu interno, tam prope sunt ut quidam eorum contingant, secundum situm: ita si plures forent 
quibus visus internus apertus, in tellure, potuissent simul esse, et mutuo colloqui, etiamsi unus foret in India et alter in Europa; quod quoque ostensum; ita omnes et singuli in tellure homines sunt 
Domino praesentissimi et sub Ipsius conspectu et Providentia. </p>
