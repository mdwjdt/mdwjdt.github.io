<h4 align="center"></h4><p><strong>5243.</strong>创世记41:14.于是，法老差人去召约瑟，他们便急忙带他出坑，他就剃头，刮胡子，换衣裳，进到法老面前。<br />“于是，法老差人”表新属世层的倾向。“去召约瑟”表接受属灵层的属天层。“他们便急忙带他出坑”表迅速抛弃诸如属于试探的状态、系一种阻碍的那类事物，以及随之所发生的变化。“他就剃头，刮胡子”表就外层属世层的覆盖物而言的抛弃和所作的改变。“换衣裳”表就内层属世层的覆盖物而言，通过披上适合它之物所作的改变。“进到法老面前”表由此与新属世层交流。</p>

Verse 14. And Pharaoh sent and called Joseph, and they brought him hastily out of the pit; and he shaved, and changed his garments, and came unto Pharaoh. "And Pharaoh sent," signifies the inclination 
of the new natural; "and called Joseph," signifies to receive the celestial of the spiritual; "and they brought him hastily out of the pit," signifies a speedy rejection of such things as from the state 
of temptation were a hindrance, and thereby a change; "and he shaved," signifies rejection and change as to what is of the exterior natural; "and changed his garments," signifies as to what is of 
the interior natural, by putting on what is suitable; "and came unto Pharaoh," signifies communication thereby with the new natural. </p>

Verse 14 And Pharaoh sent and called Joseph, and they hurried him out of the pit; and he clipped [his hair and beard], and changed his clothes, and came to Pharaoh. </p>
<p>'And Pharaoh sent' means the inclination 
of the new natural. 'And called Joseph' means to accept the celestial of the spiritual. 'And they hurried him out of the pit' means a hasty casting aside of such things as, belonging to a state 
of temptation, were a hindrance, and a consequent change that was made. 'And he clipped [his hair and beard]' means a casting aside and the change made so far as the coverings of the exterior natural 
were concerned. 'And changed his clothes' means the change made so far as the coverings of the interior natural were concerned, by the putting on of what was rightly suited to this. 'And came to 'Pharaoh' 
means a communication in this guise with the new natural.  </p>

Vers. 14.  Et misit Pharaoh, et vocavit Josephum, et acceleraverunt eum e fovea, et totondit, et mutavit vestes suas, et venit ad Pharaonem.  `Et misit Pharaoh' significat naturalis novi propensionem: 
 `et vocavit Josephum' significat ad recipiendum caeleste spiritualis:  `et acceleraverunt eum e fovea' significat festinam rejectionem talium quae impediverunt ex statu tentationis, et inde mutationem: 
 `et totondit' significat rejectionem et mutationem quoad illa quae sunt exterioris naturalis:  `et mutavit vestes suas' significat quoad illa quae sunt interioris naturalis, induendo convenientia: 
 et venit ad Pharaonem' significat sic communicationem cum novo naturali. </p>
