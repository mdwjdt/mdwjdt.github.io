Verses 5-9. And Pharaoh's daughter came down to wash at the river; and her girls were going at the side of the river; and she saw the ark in the midst of the sedge, and sent her handmaid, and took it. 
And she opened it and saw him, the child; and behold the boy wept. And she had compassion on him, and said, This is one of the Hebrews' children. And his sister said to Pharaoh's daughter, Shall I go 
and call thee a woman, a nurse, from the Hebrew women, that she may suckle the child for thee? And Pharaoh's daughter said to her, Go. And the girl went, and called the mother of the child. And Pharaoh's 
daughter said to her, Take this child to thee, and suckle him for me, and I will give thee thy wages. And the woman took the child and suckled him. "And Pharaoh's daughter came down," signifies 
the religiosity there; "to wash at the river," signifies worship from falsity; "and her girls were going at the side of the river," signifies the ministries of that religiosity that was from falsity; 
"and she saw the ark in the midst of the sedge," signifies a perception of truth that it was of low value among false memory-knowledge; "and she sent her handmaid," signifies service; "and took it," signifies 
curiosity; "and she opened it, and saw him, the child," signifies investigation of its quality, and a perception that it was truth from the Divine; "and behold the boy wept," signifies sadness; 
"and she had compassion on him," signifies admonition from the Divine; "and she said, This is one of the Hebrews' children," signifies that it was of the church itself; "and his sister said to Pharaoh's 
daughter," signifies the truth of the church near the religiosity there; "Shall I go and call thee a woman a nurse from the Hebrew women?" signifies perception that good was to be instilled therein 
by the church itself; "and Pharaoh's daughter said to her, Go," signifies consent from the religiosity there; "and the girl went and called the mother of the child," signifies the truth of good of 
the church, that it adjoined the things of the church; "and Pharaoh's daughter said to her," signifies consent from the religiosity there; "take this child to thee," signifies that it should adjoin it 
to itself; "and suckle him for me," signifies that it should insinuate into it good suited to the religiosity; "and I will give thee thy wages," signifies recompense; "and the woman took the child, 
and suckled him," signifies that good was instilled into it by the church. </p>

Verses 5-9 And the daughter of Pharaoh went down to wash at the river; and her maidservants were going along the side of the river. And she saw the box in the middle of the weed, and sent her servant-girl; 
and she took it. And she opened it, and saw him, the child; and behold, the boy was crying. And she took pity on him, and said, This is one of the children of the Hebrews. And his sister said to 
Pharaoh's daughter, Shall I go and call you a woman, a wet nurse, from the Hebrew women, that she may nurse the child for you? And Pharaoh's daughter said to her, Go. And the girl went and called the 
child's mother. And Pharaoh's daughter said to her, Take to yourself this child and nurse him for me, and I will give you your wages. And the woman took the child and nursed him. </p>
<p>'And the daughter 
of Pharaoh went down' means the kind of religion practised there. 'To wash at the river' means worship involving the use of falsity. 'And her maidservants were going along the side of the river' means

was like, and the discernment that it was truth originating in the Divine. 'And behold, the boy was crying' means sadness. 'And she took pity on him' means being alerted by the Divine. 'And said, This 
is one of the children of the Hebrews' means that it belonged to the true Church. 'And his sister said to Pharaoh's daughter' means the Church's truth alongside the kind of religion there. 'Shall I go 
and call you a woman, a wet nurse, from the Hebrew women?' means a perception that good from the true Church should be instilled into it. 'And Pharaoh's daughter said to her, Go' means consent given 
by the kind of religion there. 'And the girl went and called the child's mother' means that the Church's truth of good linked things of the Church to it. 'And Pharaoh's daughter said to her' means consent 
given by the kind of religion there. 'Take to yourself this child' means that she should link him to herself. 'And nurse him for me' means that she should instill into him good compatible with that 
kind of religion. 'And I will give you your wages' means the reward. 'And the woman took the child and nursed him' means that good from the Church was instilled into him. </p>
