<h3 align="center" class="ired">属天的奥秘 第2021节</h3>
<h4 align="center"></h4><p><strong>2021.</strong>“永远的约”表与这些人的结合。这从“约”的含义清楚可知，“约”是指结合，如前所述（<a href="665.htm">665</a>，<a href="666.htm">666</a>，<a href="1023.htm">1023</a>，<a href="1038.htm">1038</a>节）。那些被称为他“种”之人就拥有这种结合，这一点从接下来的经文清楚可知，因为“约”在本节第二次被提及。第一次提到的“约”涉及耶和华与人性本质的融合，第二次提到的“约”涉及与那些作为“种”之人的结合。为了对主的神性本质与其人性本质的融合，以及主凭借仁之信与人类的结合形成更为清晰的概念，此处和下文最好将前者称为融合（union），将后者称为结合（conjunction）。主的神性本质与其人性本质之间存在一个融合；而主与人类之间凭借仁之信存在一个结合。这一点从以下事实明显可知：耶和华或主是生命，祂的人性本质也要成为生命，如前所示，生命与生命之间存在融合。而人并非生命，只是生命的接受者，如前所示，当生命流入生命的接受者时，结合就产生了。因为生命会使自身适应接受者，如同主动物适应被动物，或如同本为活物者适应本为死物，但通过本为活物者而存活者。主因与工具因（如它们被称谓的）的确看似结合在一起，仿佛它们是一体，但它们并非一体，因为前者与后者都自行存在。人并非凭自己活着，而是主以其怜悯将他联结于祂自己，由此使他活到永远。主与人彼此截然不同，相互分离，故采用结合这个术语。</p>

For an eternal covenant. That this signifies conjunction with these, is evident from the signification of a "covenant," as being conjunction (explained before, n. 665, 666, 1023, 1038) and that it is 
with those who are called his "seed" is evident from its immediately following, and because a "covenant" is spoken of a second time in this verse. The "covenant" first spoken of refers to the union of 
Jehovah with the Human Essence, and the second mention of a "covenant" refers to the conjunction with those who are the seed. In order that a more distinct idea may be formed concerning the union of 
the Lord's Divine Essence with His Human Essence, and concerning the Lord's conjunction with the human race through the faith of charity, it may be well here and in what follows to call the former Union, 
but the latter Conjunction. Between the Lord's Divine Essence and His Human Essence there was a Union; but between the Lord and the human race there is a Conjunction, through the faith of charity, 
as is evident from the fact that Jehovah or the Lord is Life, and that His Human Essence also was made Life, as shown above, and between Life and Life there is Union. Whereas man is not Life, but a 
recipient of life, as also has been shown before; and when Life flows into a recipient of life, there is conjunction; for it is adapted to the recipient as is the active to the passive, or as that which 
is in itself alive to that which is in itself dead, and which lives therefrom. The principal and the instrumental-as they are termed-do indeed appear to be conjoined together as if they were a one, 
but still they are not a one; for the former is by itself, and the latter is by itself. Man does not live from himself, but the Lord in mercy adjoins man to Himself and thereby causes him to live to 
eternity; and because the Lord and man are thus distinct, it is called conjunction. </p>

<p align="center"><b>Elliott(1983-1999) 2021</b></p><p><b>2021.</b>
'For an eternal covenant' means conjunction with these people. This is clear from the meaning of 'a covenant' as conjunction, dealt with already in <a href="665.htm">665</a>, <a href="666.htm">666</a>, <a href="1023.htm">1023</a>, <a href="1038.htm">1038</a>; and that this conjunction is 
with those called 'the seed' is clear from the fact of its coming immediately after a reference to that 'seed', and of its being a second mention in this verse of a covenant. Thus the first mention of 
'a covenant' has reference to the union of Jehovah with the Human Essence, and the second to the conjunction with those who are 'the seed'. To allow a clearer idea of the union of the Lord's Divine Essence 
with the Human Essence and of the conjunction of the Lord with the human race by means of the faith that inheres in charity, let the term union here and from now on be used to describe the first 
of these, and conjunction the second. Indeed the bond between the Lord's Divine Essence and Human Essence really was a union, but that between the Lord and the human race by means of the faith that 
inheres in charity is conjunction. From this it is clear that because Jehovah or the Lord is Life, His Human Essence became Life as well, as shown above. It was a union of life with life. Man however 
is not life but a recipient of life, as also shown already. When life flows into a recipient of life conjunction takes place, for life accommodates itself to the recipient as active does to passive or 
as that which in itself is living does to that which in itself is dead but made living from that which in itself is living. In the case of the principal and the instrumental, as they are called, they 
do indeed seem to have been joined together to exist as one. Nevertheless they are not one, for each exists by itself. Man does not live of himself, but the Lord in His mercy links him to Himself and 
in so doing causes him to live for ever. And because the Lord and man are distinct and separate from each other the term conjunction is used. </p>

</p><b>2021.</b>
`In foedus aeternum': quod significet conjunctionem cum his, constat a significatione `foederis' quod sit conjunctio, de qua prius n. 665, 666, 1023, 1038; et quod cum illis qui vocantur semen, constat 
ex eo quod immediate sequatur, et quod foedus iterum (o)in hoc versu dicatur, ita prius (t) se refert' ad unionem Jehovae cum Essentia Humana, alterum ad conjunctionem cum his qui sunt semen. {1} 
Ut distinctior idea habeatur de unione Divinae Essentiae Domini cum Humana, et de conjunctione Domini cum humano genere per fidem charitatis, hic et in sequentibus licet illam `unionem' appellare, hanc 
autem `conjunctionem'; Divinae etiam Essentiae Domini cum Humana fuit unio, Domini autem cum `genere humano' per fidem charitatis est conjunctio; quod inde constat quia Jehovah seu Dominus est Vita, 
Cujus Humana Essentia etiam facta est Vita, ut supra ostensum; vitae cum vita est unio; at homo non est vita sed recipiens vitae, ut prius quoque {2} ostensum est; cum vita influit in recipiens vitae, 
est conjunctio, nam ei adaptatur sicut agens patienti, seu sicut vivum in se mortuo in se, quod inde vivit; principale cum instrumentali ut appellantur, quidem conjunctum apparet sicut forent unum, 
sed usque non sunt unum, per se enim est illud, et per se est hoc; homo ex se non vivit, sed Dominus ex misericordia eum Sibi adjungit, et sic eum vivere facit in aeternum; et quia ita distincti sunt, 
conjunctio dicitur. 	@1 The remainder of this paragraph is crossed through (once) in A, possibly because it is a repetition of n. 2004, though the subject is here more fully treated.$ 	@2 etiam.$ </p>
