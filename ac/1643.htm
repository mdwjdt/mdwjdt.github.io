<h3 align="center" class="ired">属天的奥秘 第1643节</h3>
<h4 align="center"></h4><p><strong>1643.</strong>天使灵的言语无法理解，所以在此用几句话简要阐述一下，只说说具有代表性的形式。他们所讨论的主题本身会以奇妙的形式有代表性地呈现出来，这种形式脱离了感官物体，并通过最宜人、最美丽的代表形像以无数种方式发生变化，同时伴随着情感的持续流注，这些情感来自从主那里经由高层天堂所涌入的相爱的欢乐流；一切事物可以说都通过这流注而活着。他们所讨论的每个主题都以这种方式通过连续不断的一系列代表形像呈现出来。无论在哪个系列，没有一个代表形像能被理性描述出来。这些就是流入灵人观念的事物，但对他们来说并不明显，除非是某种普遍流入并感染他们的事物。他们不象天使灵那样对这些事物有清晰的直觉。</p><br />

<p><strong>[NCE]1643.</strong> The speech of angelic spirits defies comprehension. To say just a few words about it 钬?but only about the representative kind 钬?it presents the actual subject matter in a representative form. This form is a remarkable one drawn from the objects of the senses, and the sweetest, most beautiful images vary it in countless ways. A continuous stream of emotions rising out of the happiness of mutual love flows in from the Lord through the next higher heaven, making absolutely everything seem to come alive. Every single topic of discussion is exhibited in this way, in unbroken series of images. To describe just one representative image from any series intelligibly would be impossible.<br />These are the influences that affect the thinking of [good] spirits, but the spirits are unaware of those influences except as a general something-or-other flowing in and affecting them. They lack a distinct perception of details that angelic spirits perceive quite clearly. </p>

The speech of angelic spirits is beyond comprehension; so that it will be treated of in few words, and only that kind which is called representative. The subject of the discourse is itself presented 
representatively in a wonderful form, which is withdrawn from the objects of sense, and is varied by means of the most pleasant and beautiful representatives in ways innumerable, with a continual influx 
of affections from the happy current of mutual love inflowing through the higher heaven from the Lord; from which influx each and all things are as it were alive. Each subject is thus presented, and 
this through continuous series. Not one single representative in any series can possibly be described to the understanding. These are the things that flow into the ideas of spirits; but to them they 
are not apparent, except as something general that flows in and affects them, without their having a distinct perception of the things that are distinctly perceived by the angelic spirits.  </p>

The speech of angelic spirits is beyond comprehension, so that the reference to it here is brief, and only to that form of it which is representative. The thing itself which they are discussing is manifested 
representatively in a wonderful form that takes shape independent of sensory objects, and is varied in countless ways by means of most delightful and beautiful representatives, accompanied by 
a constant influx of affections from the happy stream of mutual love flowing from the Lord by way of the higher heaven, from which influx every single thing so to speak is made living. Every thing they 
discuss is manifested in this manner, and by means of continuous series of representatives. Not one in any series can possibly be described intelligibly. These are the things that flow into the spirits' 
ideas, but to them are not apparent except as something general flowing in and affecting them. They do not have any clear perception of the things which are clearly perceived by angelic spirits. </p>

</p><b>1643.</b>
Loquela spirituum angelicorum est incomprehensibilis; ut paucis de loquela eorum, sed modo repraesentativa, dicatur: ipsa res sistitur repraesentative in forma mirabili quae abstracta est a sensuum 
objectis, et per repraesentativa amoenissima et pulcherrima innumeris modis variatur, cum continuo influxu affectionum ex felici amoris mutui influente per caelum superius a Domino, ex quo influxu sicut 
vivunt omnia et singula; unaquaevis res ita sistitur, et hoc per continuas series; unum solum repraesentativum in serie aliqua, nusquam ad intellectum describi potest: haec sunt quae influunt in ideas 
spirituum, sed his non apparent nisi ut commune quid afficiens influens absque distincta perceptione illorum quae distincte percipiuntur apud spiritus angelicos. </p>
