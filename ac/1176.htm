<h3 align="center" class="ired">属天的奥秘 第1176节</h3>
<h4 align="center"></h4><p><strong>1176.</strong>“古实又生宁录”表那些具有对内在事物的认知之人是这类敬拜的发起者。这从刚才所述清楚可知。对内在事物的认知就是他们所说的教义，他们还对教义与仪式作了区分。例如，其主要教义是唯信得救，殊不知，爱主爱邻才是信本身；他们称之为信的认知只是为了这个目的而存在，人们藉着这些认知从主接受对祂的爱和对邻人的爱；这才是那得救之信。生下并发起上述这类敬拜的，就是那些唯独视认知为信的人。</p>

<p><strong>[NCE]1176.</strong> Cush fathered Nimrod means that people who possessed a knowledge of deeper things founded this kind of worship, as can be seen from what has just been said. The knowledge of deeper things consists of ideas that they call doctrines and distinguish from matters of ritual. Their main doctrine, for instance, is the notion that faith alone saves us.{*1} They do not realize that love for the Lord and love for our neighbor is real faith. They also fail to see that the knowledge they call faith exists only to lead us to receive love — love for the Lord and love for our neighbor — from the Lord. They do not know that this is the faith that saves us.<br />People who call bare knowledge faith are those who father and found the kind of worship described above. They are discussed earlier [<a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_1176/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_1162" target=_top>1162:1</a>].<br /><br /><strong>Footnotes:</strong><br />{*1} On this doctrine of "faith alone," see note 1 in <a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_1176/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_724" target=_top>724</a>, and note 1 in <a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_1176/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_1077" target=_top>1077</a> in this volume.

Cush begat Nimrod. That this signifies that they who had knowledges of interior things instituted such worship, is evident from what has just been said. Knowledges of interior things are what they call 
doctrinals, which they also distinguish from rituals. For example, their chief doctrinal is that faith alone saves; but they do not know that love to the Lord and love toward the neighbor are faith 
itself; and that the knowledges which they call faith exist for no other end than that by means of them men may receive from the Lord love to Him and love toward the neighbor; and that this is the faith 
which saves. It is those who make faith consist in knowledges alone, who beget and institute such worship as is spoken of above. </p>

That 'Cush begot Nimrod' means that those who had cognitions of interior things were the instigators of such worship is clear from what has just been stated. Cognitions of interior things are what they 
call matters of doctrine, which they also distinguish from ritual forms. For example, their chief point of doctrine is that faith alone saves, but they are not aware of the fact that love to the Lord 
and love towards the neighbour constitute faith itself, and that the cognitions which they call faith exist for no other purpose than that through them people may receive from the Lord love to Him 
and love towards the neighbour, and that this is the faith which saves. Those who refer to cognitions alone as faith are the people who beget and instigate the kind of worship described above. </p>

</p><b>1176.</b>
Quod 'Cush genuit Nimrodum' sit quod qui cognitiones interiorum habuerunt, talem cultum instituerint, constat ex illis quae nunc dicta sunt; cognitiones interiorum sunt illa quae doctrinalia vocant, 
et quae etiam distinguunt a ritualibus; sicut pro exemplo praecipuum eorum doctrinale est quod fides sola salvificet, sed nesciunt quod amor in Dominum et amor erga proximum sit ipsa fides; et quod cognitiones 
quas vocant fidem, non sint nisi ob finem ut per illas accipiant a Domino amorem in Ipsum et amorem erga proximum; et quod haec fides sit quae salvificat:  illi qui solas cognitiones vocant 
fidem, sunt qui talem cultum gignunt et instituunt, de quo supra. </p>
