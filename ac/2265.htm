<h3 align="center" class="ired">属天的奥秘 第2265节</h3>
<h4 align="center"></h4><p><strong>2265.</strong>“看哪，我虽是尘土炉灰，求你容我大胆向我主说”表就相对人性的性质而言，人性里面的谦卑（状态）。前面数次论述了主处于人性时的状态，或其谦卑的状态，和主处于神性时的状态，或其荣耀的状态。还说明，在谦卑的状态下，祂与耶和华说话，仿佛与另一个人说话，而在荣耀的状态下则是与祂自己说话（参看<a href="1999.htm">1999</a>节）。由于此处如前面所说的，“亚伯拉罕”代表处于人性时的主，故经上说，在这种状态下，相对神性而言，这人性就是“尘土炉灰”。这也是为何这种状态被称作谦卑的状态。谦卑是由自我承认相对来说人就是这样（即就是尘土炉灰）所产生的。这人性在此并非指神性人，而是指主从母亲那里所获得的人身；祂会完全逐出这人身，并披上神性人以取代之。此处提及的如尘土炉灰的人性正是前一种人身，也就是来自母亲的人身（参看前面所述，<a href="2159.htm">2159</a>节）。</p>

Behold I pray I have taken upon me to speak unto my Lord, and I am dust and ashes. That this signifies the humiliation of the human as to its relative quality, is evident. The Lord's state in the human 
(or His state of humiliation), and the Lord's state in the Divine (or His state of glorification), have been treated of several times before; and it has been shown that in His state of humiliation 
the Lord spoke with Jehovah as with another; but in His state of glorification, as with Himself (n. 1999). As in the present passage Abraham (as before said) represents the Lord in His human, it is said 
in that state that relatively to the Divine the human is dust and ashes; on which account that state is also called His state of humiliation. The humiliation results from the self-acknowledgment that 
one is relatively of such a character. By the human in this place is not meant the Divine Human, but the human which the Lord derived from the mother, and which He utterly expelled, and put on in its 
stead the Divine Human. It is the former human, namely, the maternal human, of which "dust and ashes" are here predicated. (See what has been said above at n. 2159.) </p>

<p align="center"><b>Elliott(1983-1999) 2265</b></p><p><b>2265.</b>
'Behold now, I have undertaken to speak to my Lord, and I am [but] dust and ashes' means, it is clear, [the state of] humiliation as to what the human was in comparison. Reference to the Lord's state 
when in the human, or His state of humiliation, and to the Lord's state when in the Divine, or His state of glorification, has been made several times already. It has also been shown that in a state 
of humiliation He spoke to Jehovah as if to another, but in a state of glorification to His own Self, see <a href="1999.htm">1999</a>. Here, because 'Abraham', as stated, represents the Lord when in the human, it is said in 
that state that the human in comparison with the Divine is 'dust and ashes'. This also is why that state is called the state of humiliation. Humiliation arises from the self-recognition that by comparison 
one is such. By the human here it is not the Divine Human that is meant but the human He derived from the mother, which He utterly cast out and in its place put on the Divine Human. It is the former 
human - that from the mother - which is referred to here as dust and ashes. See what has been stated above in <a href="2159.htm">2159</a>. </p>

`Ecce quaeso suscepi ad loquendum ad Dominum meum, et ego pulvis et cinis' quod significet humiliationem humani {1} quale esset respective, [constat]: de statu Domini in humano, seu (o)statu humiliationis 
Ipsius, et de statu Domini in Divino, seu glorificationis Ipsius, prius aliquoties actum est; tum quod in statu humiliationis locutus cum Jehovah sicut cum alio, at {2} in statu glorificationis 
cum Se Ipso, videatur n. 1999 hic quia `Abrahamus' repraesentat Dominum in humano, ut dictum, in illo statu dicitur {3} quod humanum sit respective ad Divinum (x)ut pulvis et cinis, quare etiam status 
ille vocatur status humiliationis; humiliatio est ex agnitione sui quod respective talis sit Per humanum hic {4} non intelligitur Humanum Divinum, sed humanum quod traxit (c)a matre, quod prorsus expulit
