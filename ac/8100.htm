<h3 align="center" class="ired">属天的奥秘 第8100节</h3>
<h4 align="center"></h4><p><strong>8100.</strong>“以色列人出埃及地，都武装着上去”表他们被带离侵扰的状态，由此准备经历试探。这从“武装着上去”和“埃及地”的含义，以及“以色列人”的代表清楚可知：“武装着上去”是指他们做好准备，在此是指准备经历试探，因为他们穿过红海被领进旷野，“旷野”是指一种经历试探的状态（参看<a href="8098.htm">8098</a>节）；“以色列人”是指那些属于属灵教会的人，如前面频繁所述；“埃及地”是指一种侵扰的状态（参看<a href="7278.htm">7278</a>节），因此，“出埃及地上去”表示被带离或释放。由此明显可知，“以色列人出埃及地，都武装着上去”表示他们被带离侵扰的状态，由此准备经历试探。至于试探和侵扰之间的区别，可参看前文（<a href="7474.htm">7474</a>节）。</p>

And the sons of Israel went up armed out of the land of Egypt. That this signifies that they were taken away from a state of infestations, and thus prepared to undergo temptations, is evident from the 
signification of "going up armed," as being that they were prepared, here, to undergo temptations, because they were led through the sea Suph into the wilderness (that "the wilderness" denotes a state 
of undergoing temptations, see above, n. 8098); from the representation of the sons of Israel, as being those who are of the spiritual church (of which frequently above); and from the signification 
of "the land of Egypt," as being a state of infestations (see n. 7278). "To go up out of the land of Egypt" denotes to be taken away, or liberated. From all this it is evident that "the sons of Israel 
went up armed out of the land of Egypt" denotes that they were taken away from a state of infestations, and were thus prepared to undergo temptations. (For the difference between temptations and infestations 
see n. 7474.) </p>

'And the children of Israel went up equipped for battle, out of the land of Egypt' means that they had been released from the state in which they underwent molestations and so had been made ready to 
suffer temptations. This is clear from the meaning of 'going up equipped for battle' as their being made ready, at this point to suffer temptations (for they were led through the Sea Suph into the wilderness, 
and 'the wilderness' is a state in which people undergo temptations, see above in <a href="8098.htm">8098</a>); from the representation of 'the children of Israel' as those who belong to the spiritual Church, dealt 
with often; and from the meaning of 'the land of Egypt' as a state of molestations, dealt with in <a href="7278.htm">7278</a>, so that 'going up out of the land' means being released or delivered. From all this it is evident 
that 'the children of Israel went up equipped for battle, out of the land of Egypt' means that they had been released from the state in which they underwent molestations and so had been made ready 
to suffer temptations. For the difference between temptations and molestations, see <a href="7474.htm">7474</a>. </p>

`Et accincti ascenderunt filii Israelis e terra Aegypti': quod significet quod ex statu infestationum exempti sint, et sic parati ad sustinendas tentationes, constat ex significatione `accincti ascendere' 
quod sit quod parati, hic ad sustinendas tentationes, quia ducti per mare Suph {1} in desertum; quod `desertum' sit status subeundi tentationes, videatur supra n. 8098; ex repraesentatione `filiorum 
Israelis' quod sint qui ab Ecclesia spirituali, de qua saepius; et ex significatione `terrae Aegypti' quod sit status infestationum, de qua n. 7278; (t)ascendere inde est eximi seu liberari; ex 
his patet quod per `accincti ascenderunt filii Israelis e terra Aegypti' sit quod ex statu infestationum exempti sint, et sic parati ad sustinendas tentationes.  Quid discriminis sit inter tentationes 
et infestationes, videatur n. 7474. 	@1 i et$ </p>
