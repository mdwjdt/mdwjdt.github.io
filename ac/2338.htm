<h3 align="center" class="ired">属天的奥秘 第2338节</h3>
<h4 align="center"></h4><p><strong>2338.</strong>“罗得切切地请他们”表当人战胜时试探的状态。只有经历试探的人才能明白这一点。如前所述，试探伴随着对主的临在和怜悯，以及救恩的质疑。这时，与此人同在、引发试探的恶灵会极力激起否定，而善灵和天使则通过主竭尽所能地驱散这种质疑的状态，并将此人保守在希望的状态，最终使他确认肯定。结果，经历试探的人就悬在否定和肯定之间。人若在试探中屈服，就留在质疑的状态，然后堕入否定；人若战胜，虽然质疑，但会让自己充满希望，依旧坚持肯定。在这种冲突期间，此人似乎迫切要求主（尤其通过祷告）来到身边，发慈悲给予帮助，将其从诅咒中解救出来。故凡论述那些正成为教会成员之人的试探的地方，如此处，这些事就用天使一开始说“不”，他们要在街上过夜，然后罗得切切地请他们，他们这才转向他，进到他屋里来描述。</p>

He urged them exceedingly. That this signifies a state of temptation which one overcomes, cannot be seen except by those who have been in temptations. As before said, temptations are attended with doubt 
in regard to the Lord's presence and mercy, and also in regard to salvation. The evil spirits who are then with the man and induce the temptation strongly inspire negation, but the good spirits and 
angels from the Lord in every possible way dispel this state of doubt, and keep the man in a state of hope, and at last confirm him in what is affirmative. The result is that a man who is in temptation 
hangs between what is negative and what is affirmative. One who yields in temptation remains in a state of doubt, and falls into what is negative; but one who overcomes is indeed in doubt, but still, 
if he suffers himself to be cheered by hope, he stands fast in what is affirmative. As during this conflict the man seems to urge the Lord, especially by prayers, to be present, to have mercy, to 
give aid, and to deliver from damnation, therefore where the temptation of those who are becoming men of the church is treated of, as in the passage before us, these things are described by the angels' 
first saying, "Nay," and that they would tarry all night in the street; and by Lot's then urging them exceedingly, so that they turned aside to him and came to his house. </p>

That 'he urged them strongly' means a state of temptation when a person overcomes does not become clear except to those who have experienced temptations. As has been stated, temptations involve feelings 
of doubt regarding the Lord's presence and mercy, and also regarding His salvation. The evil spirits who are present with man at such times and who are the cause of temptation do all they can to infuse 
a negative outlook, but good spirits and angels from the Lord in every way disperse that doubting attitude, all the time preserving a feeling of hope and in the end strengthening an affirmative 
outlook. Consequently a person undergoing temptation hangs between a negative outlook and an affirmative outlook. Anyone who gives way in temptation remains in a doubting, and sinks into a negative, frame 
of mind, whereas one who overcomes still experiences feelings of doubt; yet he who allows himself to be filled with hope remains steadfastly in an affirmative outlook. Because man seems during such 
conflict to urge the Lord, especially through prayers, to be at hand, to take pity, to bring help, and to free from condemnation, this is described at this point where the temptation of those who are 
becoming members of the Church is the subject. It is described by the angels first of all saying, No, they would spend the night in the street, but by Lot urging them strongly, so that they turned 
aside to him and came into his house. </p>

</p><b>2338.</b>
`Urgebat eos valde': quod significet statum tentationis cum vincit, non constare potest nisi illis qui in tentationibus fuerunt; tentationes secum habent, ut dictum, dubitationem de praesentia et misericordia 
Domini, tum de salvatione; spiritus mali qui tunc apud hominem, et inducunt tentationem, negativum fortiter inspirant, sed spiritus boni et angeli a Domino dubitativum hoc omni modo discutiunt, 
et in spe continuo {1} tenent, ac demum affirmativum confirmant; inde homo qui in tentatione, haeret inter negativum et affirmativum; qui succumbit, in dubitativo manet, et in negativum cadit; at 
qui vincit, in dubitativo quidem est, sed usque qui {2} spe patitur se erigi, in affirmativo perstat; quia in pugna illa homo urgere videtur Dominum, imprimis per preces, ut adsit, misereatur, opem ferat, 
a damnatione liberet, hic ubi de tentatione illorum qui fiunt homines Ecclesiae, agitur, describitur illa per quod angeli dixerint primum `non,' et quod `pernoctarent in platea,' at quod Lot urgeret 
eos valde, et sic quod `declinaverint ad eum, et venerint in domum ejus.' 	@1 S does not seem to distinguish between continuo (= forthwith) and continue (= continually). The latter meaning seems 
probable here.$ 	@2 quia or qui a.$ </p>
