<h3 align="center" class="ired">属天的奥秘 第2780节</h3>
<h4 align="center"></h4><p><strong>2780.</strong>“亚伯拉罕清早起来”表平安和纯真的状态。这从论及主，也就是此处的亚伯拉罕时，“早晨”和“清早起来”的含义清楚可知。广义来说，“早晨”表主，并由此表祂的国度，故它表爱的属天元素，无论总体还是细节，如前所示（<a href="2333.htm">2333</a>节）。它因表这些事物，故表它们所在的状态本身，这种状态就是平安和纯真的状态。天上平安的状态就像世上黎明的状态。一切属天和属灵之物都出现在天上平安的状态中，并由此获得其一切幸福、喜悦和快乐。如同世间的清晨，万物以快乐宜人的气息呈现在世人面前。因为每一具体的属天或属灵之物都从总的情感中得其品质（参看<a href="920.htm">920</a>，<a href="2384.htm">2384</a>节）。这同样适用于纯真的状态。纯真的状态出现在平安的状态中，是影响爱与信的一切事物的某种总体事物。若非爱与信之物拥有纯真在里面，它们便缺乏自己的本质元素。正因如此，若不具有某种纯真，没人能进入天堂（参看马可福音<a href="http://39-27.cn/可10.15.htm">10:15</a>）。由此明显可知，“早晨”的内义是什么，甚至他“清早起来”这句话是什么意思。由于“早晨”在至高义上是指主，产生并影响其国度中的一切事物的状态就来自祂，故“早晨”和“清早起来”表示出现在这种状态中的很多其它事物，并与接下来内义上的事物有关。</p>

And Abraham rose early in the morning. That this signifies a state of peace and innocence, is evident from the signification of "morning," and also of "rising early," when predicated of the Lord, who 
here is "Abraham." "Morning" in the universal sense signifies the Lord, and hence His kingdom; consequently the celestial of love in general and in particular (as was shown n. 2333); and as it signifies 
these, it signifies the state itself in which they are, which state is that of peace and innocence. The state of peace in the heavens is like that of the dawn on earth. In the state of peace in the 
heavens come forth all celestial and spiritual things, and derive therefrom all that is auspicious, blessed, and happy in them, as in the time of dawn on earth all things come forth before man as things 
of delight and gladness; for all the singulars derive their quality from the general affection (see n. 920, 2384). The case is the same with the state of innocence: this comes forth in the state 
of peace, and is a general thing affecting all the things of love and faith. Unless these have innocence in them, they lack their essential. Hence it is that no one can come into heaven unless he have 
something of innocence (see Mark 10:15). It is plain from this what "morning" signifies in the internal sense, and still more when it is said that he "rose early in the morning;" and as in the highest 
sense "morning" is the Lord, and as the state is from Him which effects and affects all things in His kingdom, "morning" and "rising in the morning" signify many other things which come forth in that 
state; and this as related to the things which follow in the internal sense. </p>

'In the morning Abraham rose up early' means a state of peace and innocence. This is clear from the meaning of 'in the morning', also of 'rising up in the early morning', when used in reference to the 
Lord, who is 'Abraham' here. 'The morning' in the universal sense means the Lord, and from this His kingdom. Consequently it means the celestial element of love in general and in particular, as shown 
in <a href="2333.htm">2333</a>. And as it means those things it means the state itself in which they exist, which state is one of peace and innocence. The state of peace in heaven is like that at dawn on earth. Within the 
state of peace in heaven all celestial and spiritual things manifest themselves, and from it they derive all their bliss, blessedness, and happiness, even as at dawn on earth when all things present 
themselves to man with a delightful and gladsome air, for each specific celestial or spiritual thing receives its character from the general affection, <a href="920.htm">920</a>, <a href="2384.htm">2384</a>. The same applies to the state of innocence. 
This manifests itself within the state of peace and is something general and overall which brings itself to bear on all things of love and faith. Unless the latter possess innocence within them 
they lack their essential element. It is for this reason that nobody is able to enter heaven unless he possesses a measure of innocence, <a href="http://bible.gospelcom.net/cgi-bin/bible?passage=Mark%2010:-15&amp;version=ESV&amp;interface=print&amp;showfn=yes&amp;showxref">Mark 10:-15</a>. From this it is evident what 'in the morning' means 
in the internal sense, even more what is meant by the words 'in the morning he rose up early'. And since in the highest sense 'the morning' is the Lord, and He is the author of the state which brings 
into being and exerts an influence on the things that exist in His kingdom, 'in the morning' and 'rising up in the morning' also mean further things still which arise in that state and are related 
to the things that follow in the internal sense. </p>

'Mane surrexit Abraham in matutino': quod significet statum pacis et innocentiae, constat a significatione `mane,' tum `surgere in matutino,' cum praedicatur de Domino, qui hic est `Abraham': `mane' 
in universali sensu significat Dominum, et inde regnum Ipsius, consequenter caeleste amoris in communi et particulari, ut n. 2333 ostensum; et quia illa, significat ipsum statum in quo sunt, qui status 
est pacis et innocentiae; status pacis in caelis se habet sicut status aurorae in terris; in statu pacis in caelis existunt omnia caelestia et spiritualia, et inde trahunt omne suum faustum, beatum 
et felix, sicut in statu aurorae in terris existunt omnia coram homine ut jucunda et laeta; singularia enim ab affectione communi trahunt quod talia sint, videatur n. 920, 2384: similiter se habet cum 
statu innocentiae; hic existit in statu pacis, et est commune afficiens omnia quae sunt amoris et fidei; haec nisi in se habeant innocentiam, carent suo essentiali; inde est quod nemo possit in caelum 
venire nisi aliquid innocentiae habeat, Marc. x 15. Inde patet quid `mane' significat in sensu interno, et magis cum dicitur `mane surrexit in matutino'; et quia in supremo sensu `mane' est Dominus, 
et ex Ipso status efficiens et afficiens illa quae in regno Ipsius sunt, etiam `mane' et `mane surgere' significat plura quae in statu illo existunt, et hoc praedicate ad ea quae in sensu interno consequuntur. </p>
