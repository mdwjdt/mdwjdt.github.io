<h3 align="center" class="ired">属天的奥秘 第220节</h3>
<h4 align="center"></h4><p><strong>220.</strong>“声音回响”表示他们只留有一丝觉知，好似它独自存在，无人理会。下一节，“耶和华呼唤那人”，也表明了这一点。又如：“在旷野，有人声喊着说……有人声说，你喊叫吧。”（以赛亚书<a href="http://39-27.cn/赛40.3.htm">40:3</a>，<a href="http://39-27.cn/赛40.6.htm">6</a>）“旷野”表缺乏信的教会，“有声音呼喊”表主要降临的喜报，笼统而言，表主每次降临的喜报，正如对重生者而言，有一种内在的呼唤。</p>

<p><strong>[NCE]220.</strong> The voice going alone means that little perception was left, as if it were all by itself and unheard, so to speak. This is evident from the next verse as well, where it says that Jehovah called or shouted to the person. Similarly in Isaiah:<br />The voice of one shouting in the wilderness; the voice said, "Shout!" (<a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_220/bible_king-james-version_isaiah_40_3" target=_top>Isaiah 40:3</a>, <a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_220/bible_king-james-version_isaiah_40_6" target=_top>6</a>)<br />The wilderness stands for a church that has no faith. The voice of one shouting stands for a proclamation of the Lord's Coming; and in general for every time his coming is proclaimed, as for instance in the case of regenerate people, who hear an inner call. </p>
<p align="center"><b>Potts(1905-1910) 220</b></p><p><b>220.</b>
By the "voice going to itself" is meant that there was but little perception remaining, and that alone as it were by itself and unheard, as is manifest also from the following verse where it is said, 
"Jehovah called to the man." So in Isaiah: </p>
<p>     The voice of one crying in the wilderness; the voice said, Cry (Isa. 40:3 and 6). The "wilderness" is a church where there is no faith; the "voice of 
one crying" is the annunciation of the Lord's advent, and in general every announcement of His coming, as with the regenerate, with whom there is an internal dictate. </p>

<p align="center"><b>Elliott(1983-1999) 220</b></p><p><b>220.</b>
'His voice going to and fro' means that only a residue of perception was left, so small as to be solitary and inaudible, so to speak. This is also clear from the next verse in which it is said that Jehovah 
called out to the man. A similar usage occurs in Isaiah,   The voice of one crying in the wilderness; the voice said, Cry! <a href="http://bible.gospelcom.net/cgi-bin/bible?passage=Isa%2040:3,%206&amp;version=ESV&amp;interface=print&amp;showfn=yes&amp;showxref">Isa 40:3, 6</a>.  </p>
<p>'Wilderness' stands for a Church where no faith exists; 
'the voice of one crying stands for the declaration of the Lord's coming, in general for every declaration of His coming, as is made to regenerate persons who have this dictate residing in them.  </p>

<p align="center"><b>Latin(1748-1756) 220</b>
</p><b>220.</b>
Per 'vocem sibi euntem' intelligitur quod parum perceptionis residuum esset, quasi sola sibi et quasi non audita, quod a sequente versiculo etiam constat ubi dicitur quod clamaverit Jehovah ad hominem; 
sicut apud Esaiam, 	Vox clamantis in deserto,...vox dixit, Clama, xi 3, 6; </p>
<p>'desertum' pro Ecclesia ubi nulla fides, 'vox clamantis' pro annuntiatione Adventas Domini, in genere pro omni adventus 
Ipsius annuntiatione, ut apud regeneratos quibus est dictamen.
