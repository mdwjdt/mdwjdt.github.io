<h3 align="center" class="ired">属天的奥秘 第3239节</h3>
<h4 align="center"></h4><p><strong>3239.</strong>“基土拉给他生了心兰、约珊、米但、米甸、伊施巴和书亚”表主的属灵国度在天上和地上的一般分类。这一点无法通过圣言很好地予以证实，因为这些人除了米甸外，都没有在别处被提及，后面对米甸有所说明。然而，这一点从以下事实清楚可知，即：圣言中所提到的所有人都代表某种事物，这从目前，也就是自创世记第一章以来所提到的所有人足以明显看出来。就圣言的内义而言，名字，无论人名、国名、地名还是城名，都表示真实事物（参看<a href="768.htm">768</a>，<a href="1224.htm">1224</a>，<a href="1264.htm">1264</a>，<a href="1876.htm">1876</a>，<a href="1888.htm">1888</a>节，以及其它许多地方，那里特别通过圣言证实了这一点）。在圣言中，这些人名除了米甸外都没有在别处被提及，这是因为他们是“东方之子”的名字，而“东方之子”在圣言中有时被提及，一般表示主的属灵国度的成员，这一点在下文，即本章6节可以看到。<br />亚伯拉罕和基土拉的这些儿子具有这样的代表性从以下事实明显看出来，即：亚伯拉罕和基土拉代表主的神性属灵人，也就是说，亚伯拉罕代表主的神性属灵良善，基土拉代表主的与该良善联结的神性真理（对此，参看<a href="3235.htm">3235</a>，<a href="3236.htm">3236</a>节）。由于亚伯拉罕和基土拉代表主的神性属灵人，故他们的儿子代表源于主的神性属灵人的国度的一般分类。之所以采用“一般分类”这样的表述，是因为主的国度由“地”（land）来代表，而地在它作为产业被赋予的人当中被分割，就像迦南地被分给以色列人那样。一般分为十二类，因为“十二”表示仁与源于仁之信的一切事物，这些事物构成主的国度，如下文所述（16节）。此处提到的是六，是这个数字的一半；而数字的一半与整个数字所包含的是一样的。只要包含的事物是一样的，那么无论乘也好，除也好，都不会改变事物本身的本质特征。</p>

And she bare him Zimran, and Jokshan, and Medan, and Midian, and Ishbak, and Shuah. That these represent the general classes of the Lord's spiritual kingdom in the heavens and on earth, cannot so well 
be established from the Word, because none of these men are elsewhere mentioned, with the exception of Midian, of whom something will be said hereafter. Yet this may be seen from the fact that all persons 
named in the Word represent something; as is sufficiently evident from all those mentioned hitherto, from the first chapter of Genesis. (That in the internal sense of the Word names, both of persons 
and of kingdoms, provinces, and cities, signify actual things, may be seen above, n. 768, 1224, 1264, 1876, 1888, and in many other places where this is in particular confirmed from the Word.) The 
reason why none of these except Midian are mentioned elsewhere in the Word, is that they are of the sons of the east, who are sometimes mentioned in the Word. (That in general the "sons of the east" 
signify those who are of the Lord's spiritual kingdom, may be seen below, at verse 6 of this chapter.) [2] That these sons of Abraham by Keturah have this representation, is evident from the fact that 
Abraham and Keturah represent the Lord as to the Divine spiritual, namely, Abraham the Lord as to Divine good spiritual, and Keturah as to Divine truth spiritual conjoined with this good (concerning 
which see just above, n. 3235, 3236). From this it follows that their sons represent the general classes or lots of the kingdom which is from the Lord's Divine spiritual. They are called general classes 
or lots because the Lord's kingdom is represented by land, which is distributed by lots among those to whom it is given to be possessed as an inheritance, just as the land of Canaan was allotted 
to the sons of Israel. There are in general twelve classes, for by "twelve" are signified all the things of charity and of the derivative faith, which are of the Lord's kingdom (concerning which see 
below, at verse 16); but here there are six, thus one-half the number; but the half of a number involves the same as the whole, for provided a like thing is involved, multiplication and division do not 
vary the thing itself as to what is essential. </p>

'She bore to him Zimran, and Jokshan, and Medan, and Midian, and Ishbak, and Shuah' represents general divisions of the Lord's spiritual kingdom in heaven and on earth. This is less clear from the Word 
since none of these names is mentioned anywhere else, except Midian, who is dealt with further on. The meaning becomes sufficiently clear however from the consideration that, without exception, all 
the persons named in the Word each have some representation, as with all those mentioned so far from the beginning of Genesis and onwards. In the internal sense of the Word the names both of persons 
and of kingdoms, and also of regions and cities, mean real things - see <a href="768.htm">768</a>, <a href="1224.htm">1224</a>, <a href="1264.htm">1264</a>, <a href="1876.htm">1876</a>, <a href="1888.htm">1888</a>, and many times elsewhere, where this matter in particular is confirmed from the Word. The reason why 
the rest of these names apart from Midian are not mentioned elsewhere in the Word is that they are the names of 'the sons of the east' who are referred to in various places in the Word and who in general 
mean members of the Lord's spiritual kingdom, as will be seen below at verse 6 of this chapter. </p>

 It is clear that these sons of Abraham by Keturah have this representation from the consideration 
that Abraham and Keturah represent the Lord's Divine Spiritual; that is to say, 'Abraham' represents the Lord's Divine Spiritual Good, 'Keturah' His Divine Spiritual Truth joined to that Good, 
dealt with just above in <a href="3235.htm">3235</a>, <a href="3236.htm">3236</a>. And because Abraham and Keturah represent the Lord's Divine Spiritual, their sons therefore represent general divisions of the kingdom which originates in the Lord's 
Divine Spiritual. The expression 'general divisions' is used because the Lord's kingdom is represented by 'the land' which is divided up among those to whom it is given to possess as an inheritance, 
as the land of Canaan was given to the children of Israel. There are in general twelve divisions, for twelve means all things of charity and of faith derived from this which constitute the Lord's kingdom, 
dealt with below at verse 16. Six, thus half that number, is mentioned here; but half of a number embodies the same as the whole number, for provided that which it embraces is similar, multiplying 
and dividing does not vary the essential character of the thing itself. </p>

`Peperit ei Zimranem et Jokshanem, et Medanem, et Midianem, et Jishbakum, et Shuahum': quod repraesentent communes sortes regni spiritualis Domini in caelis et in terris, non ita constare potest ex 
Verbo, quia non alii ex illis memorantur alibi quam `Midian,' de quo sequitur; ex eo tamen quod omnes personae quotcumque nominantur in Verbo, aliquid repraesentent, ut ab illis omnibus qui hactenus a 
primo capite Geneseos memorati sunt, satis constare potest; quod nomina tam personarum quam regnorum, {1}et provinciarum et urbium, in sensu interno Verbi res significent, videatur n. 768, 1224, 1264, 
1876, 1888, et multoties alibi, ubi hoc in particulari e Verbo confirmatur: quod reliqui ab his praeter Midianem non alibi in Verbo memorentur, est causa quia {2}sunt ex `filiis orientis,' de quibus 
passim in Verbo, qui quod in communi significent illos qui ex regno spirituali Domini sunt, infra ad vers. 6 hujus capitis videbitur: [2] quod hi Abrahami ex Keturah filii id repraesentent, constat ex 
eo quod `Abraham et Keturah' repraesentent Dominum quoad Divinum Spirituale, nempe `Abraham' Dominum quoad Divinum Bonum Spirituale, `Keturah' quoad Divinum Verum Spirituale illi Bono conjunctum, de 
quibus mox supra n. 3235, 3236; exinde sequitur quod `filii illorum' repraesentent communes sortes regni quod ex Divino Spirituali Domini. Communes sortes dicuntur quia regnum Domini repraesentatur per 
`terram,' quae distribuitur per sortes inter illos quibus illa datur sicut hereditas possidenda, quemadmodum terra Canaan filiis Israelis; sortes in communi sunt duodecim, nam per `duodecim' significantur 
omnia charitatis et inde fidei quae sunt regni Domini, de quibus infra ad vers. 16; hic autem sunt `sex,' ita dimidio numero, sed dimidius numerus idem involvit ac integer, nam (t)multiplicatio 
et divisio, modo simile inest, non ipsam rem quoad essentiale variant. @1 i ut$  @2 i hi$  </p>
