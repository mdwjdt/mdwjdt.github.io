<h3 align="center" class="ired">属天的奥秘 第2015节</h3>
<h4 align="center"></h4><p><strong>2015.</strong>“君王从你而出”表一切真理皆来自祂。这从“君王”的含义清楚可知，无论在圣言的历史部分还是预言部分，“君王”都指真理，这在前面有所论述（<a href="1672.htm">1672</a>节），但没有充分阐明。从“列族”表良善、“君王”表真理可以看出圣言内义的性质，还能看出内义距离字义何等遥远。人在阅读圣言，尤其历史部分时，只会以为那里所提到的“民族”就是民族，“君王”就是君王，因而以为圣言本身所论述的真正主题是民族和君王。殊不知，民族和君王的概念一到天使那里就完全消失了，取而代之的是良善与真理。这一点看上去肯定显得很奇怪，而且的确是一个悖论，然而，却是千真万确的。若考虑到以下事实，谁都能明白这个问题：即若在圣言中，“民族”表示民族，“君王”表示君王，那么主的圣言和其它历史或作品一样，几乎不包含任何事物，因而纯粹是世俗事件。而事实上，圣言中的一切事物都是神性，因而是属天和属灵的。<br />仅举一例。本节经文说，亚伯拉罕极能生殖，列族必从他而立，君王必从他而出。这句经文不就是纯粹的世俗事件，根本不是天上的事吗？因为这些事只含有世俗的荣耀，而在天堂，世俗的荣耀根本什么都不是。但是，若这是主的圣言，那它必含有天堂的荣耀，而无一丝世俗的荣耀。所以，字义在上达天堂时会完全被抹掉，消失不见，它会被净化得无一丝世俗之物掺杂。因为“亚伯拉罕”并非指亚伯拉罕，而是指主；他“极能生殖”并非指他的后代极其繁多，而是指主人性本质的良善会无限增多；“列族”不是指诸民族，而是指良善；“君王”也不是指君王，而是指真理。尽管如此，字面上的历史仍是真实的历史，因为亚伯拉罕的确有这样一段对话，他也的确极能生殖，并且列族和君王从他而出。<br />“君王”表真理，这从以下经文清楚看出来。以赛亚书：<br />外邦人必建筑你的城墙，他们的王必服事你。你也必吃列族的奶，又吮列王的乳。（以赛亚书<a href="http://39-27.cn/赛60.10.htm">60:10</a>，<a href="http://39-27.cn/赛60.16.htm">16</a>）<br />“列族的奶”和“列王的乳”绝非字面上的意思，而是具有内义，表示被赋予良善，在真理上得到指教。耶利米书：<br />那时就有坐大卫宝座的君王和首领，或坐车，或骑马进入这城的各门。（耶利米书<a href="http://39-27.cn/耶17.25.htm">17:25</a>；<a href="http://39-27.cn/耶22.4.htm">22:4</a>）<br />“或坐车，或骑马”是一个预言，它表示富有理解力之物。这从先知书中的很多经文清楚看出来。因此，就内义而言，“君王进入这城的各门”表他们要被赋予信之真理。这就是圣言的天堂之义，而世俗的字义会逐渐变成天堂之义。<br />同一先知书：<br />耶和华在烈怒中藐视君王和祭司。锡安的门，都陷入土地内，祂将她的门闩毁坏折断。君王和首领落在列族中，再没有律法。（耶利米哀歌<a href="http://39-27.cn/哀2.6.htm">2:6</a>，<a href="http://39-27.cn/哀2.9.htm">9</a>）<br />此处“君王”表信之真理，“祭司”表仁之良善，“锡安”表教会，它被毁灭，它的门闩被折断。因此，“君王和首领落在列族中”，也就是说，真理及其所属一切将完全被驱逐，以致“再没有律法”，即信之教义荡然无存。以赛亚书：<br />在这孩子还不晓得弃恶择善之先，你所憎恶的那二王之地必致见弃。（以赛亚书<a href="http://39-27.cn/赛7.16.htm">7:16</a>）<br />这论及主的到来。“那地必致见弃”表那时不复存在的信。“王”是指将被憎恶的信之真理。<br />同一先知书：<br />我必向列族举手，向万民竖立我的大旗，他们必将你的众子怀中抱来，将你的众女肩上扛来。列王必作你的养父，他们的王后必作你的乳母。（以赛亚书<a href="http://39-27.cn/赛49.22.htm">49:22</a>，<a href="http://39-27.cn/赛49.23.htm">23</a>）<br />“列族”和“众女”表良善，“万民”和“众子”表真理，如第一卷所示。“列族”表良善（<a href="1259.htm">1259</a>，<a href="1260.htm">1260</a>，<a href="1416.htm">1416</a>，<a href="1849.htm">1849</a>节）；“众女”也表良善（<a href="489.htm">489</a>-<a href="491.htm">491</a>节）；而“万民”表真理（<a href="1259.htm">1259</a>，<a href="1260.htm">1260</a>节）；“众子”也表真理（<a href="489.htm">489</a>，<a href="491.htm">491</a>，<a href="533.htm">533</a>，<a href="1147.htm">1147</a>节）。因此，“君王”一般表真理，他们必被这真理滋养，而他们的“王后”表良善，他们必通过这良善被乳养。无论你说良善与真理，还是那些被良善与真理所主导的人，意思都一样。<br /><br />他必洗净许多民族，君王要闭口。因所未曾传与他们的，他们必看见；未曾听见的，他们要明白。（以赛亚书<a href="http://39-27.cn/赛52.15.htm">52:15</a>）<br />这论及主的到来。“民族”表那些被良善的情感所激励的人，“君王”表那些被真理的情感所激励的人。诗篇：<br />现在，君王啊！你们应当省悟；世上的审判官啊，你们该受管教！当存畏惧事奉耶和华，又当存战兢而快乐。当亲吻儿子，恐怕祂发怒，你们便在道中灭亡。（诗篇<a href="http://39-27.cn/诗2.10.htm">2:10</a>-<a href="http://39-27.cn/诗2.12.htm">12</a>）<br />“君王”表那些由真理所主导的人，他们凭真理在很多地方也被称作“王的众子”。此处“儿子”表主，他在此叫做儿子，是因为他是真理本身，是一切真理的源头。<br />启示录：<br />他们唱新歌。你配拿书卷，配揭开其印。你使我们成为我们神的君王和祭司，我们要在地上执掌王权。（启示录<a href="http://39-27.cn/启5.9.htm">5:9</a>，<a href="http://39-27.cn/启5.10.htm">10</a>）<br />此处由真理所主导的人被称作“君王”。在马太福音中，主也称他们为“王的众子”：<br />那撒好种的就是人子，田地就是世界，好种就是王的众子，稗子就是那恶者的众子。（马太福音<a href="http://39-27.cn/太13.37.htm">13:37</a>，<a href="http://39-27.cn/太13.38.htm">38</a>）<br />启示录：<br />第六位天使把碗倒在伯拉大河上，河水就干了，要给那从日出之地所来的众王预备道路。（启示录<a href="http://39-27.cn/启16.12.htm">16:12</a>）<br />“伯拉”明显不是指伯拉，“从日出之地所来的众王”也不是指从那个地区来的众王。“伯拉”的含义可见于前文（<a href="120.htm">120</a>，<a href="1585.htm">1585</a>，<a href="1866.htm">1866</a>节），从那里明显可知，“从日出之地所来的众王的道路”表源于爱之善的信之真。<br /><br />得救的列族要在城的光里行走，地上的君王必将自己的荣耀归与那城。（启示录<a href="http://39-27.cn/启21.24.htm">21:24</a>）<br />此处“列族”表由良善所主导的人，“地上的君王”表那些由真理所主导的人。这也可从以下事实明显看出来，即此处的细节并非历史，而是预言。<br />地上的君王与坐在众水上的大淫妇行淫，喝醉了她淫乱的酒。（启示录<a href="http://39-27.cn/启17.2.htm">17:2</a>）<br />还有：<br />巴比伦用她邪淫大怒的酒把列族灌醉了。地上的君王与她行淫。（启示录<a href="http://39-27.cn/启18.3.htm">18:3</a>，<a href="http://39-27.cn/启18.9.htm">9</a>）<br />此处同样很明显，“地上的君王”并非指君王，因为所论述的主题是对信之教义，即真理的歪曲和亵渎，也就是“邪淫”。“地上的君王”表被歪曲和亵渎的真理。<br /><br />你所看见的那十角就是十王，他们还没有得国，但他们一时之间要和兽同得权柄，与王一样。他们同心合意将自己的能力权柄给那兽。（启示录<a href="http://39-27.cn/启17.12.htm">17:12</a>，<a href="http://39-27.cn/启17.13.htm">13</a>）<br />“王”在此并非指王，谁都能明显看出来这一点。若所指的是王，那么“十王一时之间要得权柄，与王一样”就完全无法理解，下面这些话也一样，启示录：<br />我看见那兽和地上的君王，并他们的众军都聚集，要与骑白马的并祂的众军争战。（启示录<a href="http://39-27.cn/启19.19.htm">19:19</a>）<br />该章13节公开声称，骑白马的那一位就是神之道；经上说与它争战的地上君王都聚集起来。“兽”表被玷污的爱之善；“君王”表被亵渎的信之真；这些被称为“地上的君王”，是因为它们存在于教会（“地”是指教会，参看<a href="662.htm">662</a>，<a href="1066.htm">1066</a>，<a href="1067.htm">1067</a>，<a href="1262.htm">1262</a>节）。“白马”表对真理的理解力；“骑白马的”表圣言。这一事实在但以理书（11章）更为明显，那里描述了“南方王”和“北方王”之间的战争，这些术语表示真理与虚假的争战。此处所描述的争战也被描述为历史上所发生的战争。<br />“王”表真理。由此可见，当主被称作王和祭司时，内义表示什么；还可看出，君王和祭司代表主的哪种本质属性。君王代表祂的神性真理，祭司代表祂的神性良善。主作为王统治宇宙所凭借的一切秩序法则就是真理；而作为祭司统治宇宙，并且也主宰真理所凭借的一切法则就是良善。因为唯独通过真理统治会将所有人都罚入地狱；但通过良善统治则会把他们从地狱提上来，并将其举升天堂（参看<a href="1728.htm">1728</a>节）。就主而言，由于这二者，即良善与真理联结在一起，所以在古时，它们由与祭司职份合在一起的王权来代表。如麦基洗德，他既是撒冷王，同时也是至高神的祭司（创世记<a href="http://39-27.cn/创14.18.htm">14:18</a>）。后来，在犹太人（代表性教会就以自己的形式设立在他们中间）当中，祂由审判官和祭司来代表，之后由诸王来代表。<br />不过，由于“王”代表真理，而真理不应是权力最大的，原因如前所述，即它们会定罪，所以，想要拥有王的想法十分令人厌恶，以至于犹太人为此受到责备。就其本身而言，真理的性质被描述为王的权利（撒母耳记上<a href="http://39-27.cn/撒上8.11.htm">8:11</a>-<a href="http://39-27.cn/撒上8.18.htm">18</a>）；此前，在摩西五经（申命记<a href="http://39-27.cn/申17.14.htm">17:14</a>-<a href="http://39-27.cn/申17.18.htm">18</a>），他们通过摩西被指示要拣选源于良善的纯正真理，而不要拣选虚假的真理；不能以推理和记忆知识亵渎它。这些就是刚才提到的摩西五经中的经文所给出的有关立王的指示所包括的考虑事项。单从字义上看，没人明白这一切。然而，这一切从内义所包含的细节清楚看出来。因此，很明显，“王”和“王权”无非代表和表示真理。</p>

<p align="center"><b>Potts(1905-1910) 2015</b></p><p><b>2015.</b>
Kings shall go forth from thee. That this signifies that all truth is from Him, is evident from the signification of a "king," in both the historical and the prophetic Word, as being truth (stated above, 
n. 1672, but not yet fully shown). From the signification of "nations" as being goods, and from the signification of "kings" as being truths, we can see the nature of the internal sense of the Word, 
and also how remote it is from the sense of the letter. He who reads the Word, especially the historical portion, has no other belief than that the nations there are nations, and the kings kings, 
and thus that nations and kings are treated of in the very Word itself. But the idea of nations, as well as that of kings, altogether perishes when it is received by the angels, and in their place there 
succeed good and truth. This cannot but appear as strange and indeed as a paradox, but still it is really so, and the truth of it may appear to everyone from considering that if, in the Word, nations 
were signified by "nations," and kings by "kings," then the Word of the Lord would involve scarcely anything more than any other history, or any other writing, and thus would be a merely worldly affair, 
when yet there is nothing in the Word that is not Divine, and therefore celestial and spiritual.  [2] Take as a single instance what is said in this verse, that Abraham should be made fruitful 
and should be made nations, and that kings should go forth from him-what is this but a merely worldly matter, and in no respect heavenly? For in these things there is only the glory of the world, which 
is nothing at all in heaven; but if this is the Word of the Lord, there must be in it the glory of heaven, and none of the world's glory. Therefore the sense of the letter is altogether obliterated 
and vanishes when it passes into heaven; and it is so purified that nothing that is worldly is intermingled. For by "Abraham" is not meant Abraham, but the Lord; by his being "made fruitful" is not meant 
that his posterity should increase exceedingly, but that the good of the Lord's Human Essence should increase to infinitude; by the "nations" are not meant nations, but goods; and by the "kings," 
not kings but truths. Still the history according to the sense of the letter remains true; for it is true that it was so said to Abraham; also that he was made fruitful, and that nations and kings came 
from him.  [3] That "kings" signify truths, may be seen from the following passages. In Isaiah: </p>
<p>The sons of strangers shall build up thy walls, and their kings shall minister unto thee; thou shalt 
suck the milk of the nations, and the breast of kings shalt thou suck (Isa. 60:10, 16); </p>
<p>what it is to "suck the milk of nations" and "the breast of kings," is by no means plain from the letter, but 
it is from the internal sense, in which it signifies to be gifted with goods, and instructed in truths. In Jeremiah: </p>
<p>     There shall enter in by the gates of this city kings and princes sitting upon 
the throne of David, riding in chariots and on horses (Jer. 17:25; 22:4); </p>
<p>to "ride in chariots and on horses" is a prophetical saying which signifies an abundance of intellectual things, as may appear 
from very many passages in the Prophets; and thus by "kings entering in by the gates of the city" is signified in the internal sense that they should be imbued with truths of faith. This is the heavenly 
sense of the Word, into which the worldly literal sense passes.  [4] Again, in the same Prophet: </p>
<p>     Jehovah hath despised in the indignation of His anger the king and the priest; the gates of 
Zion have sunk into the earth; He hath destroyed and broken her bars; her king and her princes are among the nations; the law is not (Lam. 2:6, 9); </p>
<p>"the king" here denotes the truth of faith; "the 
priest" the good of charity; "Zion" the church which is being destroyed, and whose bars are being broken; hence "the king and the princes are among the nations," that is, truth and the things which are 
of truth will be banished to such an extent that there will be no "law," that is, nothing of the doctrine of faith. In Isaiah: </p>
<p>     Before the child shall know to refuse the evil and choose the good, 
the ground shall be forsaken, which thou loathest in the presence of her two kings (Isa. 7:16); </p>
<p>where the Lord's coming is treated of; the "ground which shall be forsaken" denotes faith, of which 
there would then be none, and the truths of which are the "kings that would be loathed."  [5] In the same Prophet: </p>
<p>     I will lift up My hand to the nations, and raise up My ensign to the peoples; 
and they shall bring thy sons in their bosom, and thy daughters shall be carried upon the shoulder; and kings shall be thy nourishers, and their queens those that give thee suck (Isa. 49:22, 23); </p>
<p>"the 
nations" and "the daughters" denote goods; and "the peoples" and "the sons" truths (as shown in Part First, where it may be seen that "nations" denote goods, n. 1259, 1260, 1416, 1849; and that "daughters" 
have a similar signification, n. 489-491; also that "peoples" denote truths, n. 1259, 1260; and "sons" likewise, n. 489, 491, 533, 1147). "Kings" therefore denote truths in general, by which they 
will be nourished, and their "queens" the goods from which they will be "suckled." Whether you say goods and truths, or those who are in goods and truths, it is the same.  [6] Again in the same Prophet: </p>
<p> 
    He shall sprinkle many nations, upon him kings shall shut their mouth-for that which was [not] told them have they seen; and that which they did not hear have they understood (Isa. 52:15), 
 where the Lord's coming is spoken of; the "nations" denote those who are affected by goods, and "kings" those who are affected by truths. In David: </p>
<p>     Now, O ye kings, be intelligent; be instructed, 
ye judges of the earth; serve Jehovah with fear, and exult with trembling. Kiss the Son, lest He be angry, and ye perish in the way (Ps. 2:10-12). "Kings" denote those who are in truths; who also 
from their truths are often called "king's sons;" "the Son" here denotes the Lord, who is here called "the Son" because He is the truth itself, and because all truth is from Him.  [7] In John: </p>
<p> 
    They shall sing a new song, Worthy art Thou who takest the book, and openest the seals thereof; Thou hast made us unto our God kings and priests, that we may reign upon the earth (Rev. 5:9-10); </p>
<p>where 
they who are in truths are called "kings." The Lord also calls such persons "the sons of the kingdom," in Matthew: </p>
<p>     He that soweth the good seed is the Son of man; the field is the world; the 
seed is the sons of the kingdom, and the tares are the sons of the evil one (Matt. 13:37-38). In John: </p>
<p>     The sixth angel poured out his vial upon the great river Euphrates; and the water thereof 
was dried up, that the way of the Kings that are from the sun rising might be prepared (Rev. 16:12). That by the "Euphrates" is not meant the Euphrates, nor by "the kings from the sun-rising" any kings 
therefrom, is evident (what is meant by the "Euphrates" may be seen above, n. 120, 1585, 1866); so that "the way of the kings that are from the sun-rising" means the truths of faith that are from 
the goods of love.  [8] In the same: </p>
<p>     The nations that are saved shall walk in the light of it, and the kings of the earth shall bring their glory and honor into it (Rev. 21:24); </p>
<p>where "the nations" 
denote those who are in goods, and "the kings of the earth" those who are in truths, as may be inferred from the fact that these words are prophetic, and not historical. In the same: </p>
<p>     With 
the great harlot that sitteth upon many waters the kings of the earth have committed whoredom, and have been made drunken with the wine of her whoredom (Rev. 17:1-2). And again: </p>
<p>     Babylon hath made 
all the nations drink of the wine of her whoredom, and the kings of the earth have committed whoredom with her (Rev. 18:3, 9); </p>
<p>where in like manner it is evident that kings are not meant by "the 
kings of the earth;" for the falsification and adulteration of the doctrine of faith, that is, of truth, is treated of, and this is the "whoredom;" " the kings of the earth" denote the truths that are 
falsified and adulterated.  [9] In the same: </p>
<p>     The ten horns which thou sawest are ten kings, that have received no kingdom as yet, but they receive authority [potestas] as kings with the beast 
for one hour. These shall have one mind, and shall give their power and authority to the beast (Rev. 17:12-13); </p>
<p>that these "kings" are not kings, is evident to everyone; for if so it would be wholly 
unintelligible that the ten kings should receive authority as kings one hour. So too in another passage: </p>
<p>     I saw the beast and the kings of the earth and their armies gathered together to make war 
with him that sat upon the horse, and with his army (Rev. 19:19); </p>
<p>that "he that sat upon the horse" is "the Word of God," is openly stated in verse 13; and it is against this that the kings of the earth 
are said to have been gathered together. "The beast" denotes the goods of love, profaned; and "the kings" denote the truths of faith, adulterated; these are called "the kings of the earth," because 
they are within the church. (That "the earth" is the church may be seen above, n. 662, 1066, 1067, 1262.) The "white horse" denotes the understanding of truth; and "he that sat upon the horse," the 
Word. This meaning is still more manifest in Daniel (chapter 11), where the war between "the king of the south" and "the king of the north" is treated of; by which terms are signified the truths and 
falsities that had fought, the combats being described here also in an historical manner by this "war."  [10] As "a king" signifies truth, it may be seen what is meant in the internal sense when the 
Lord is called a King and also a Priest; and also what it was in the Lord that was represented by kings, and what by priests. Kings represented His Divine truth, and priests His Divine good. All the laws 
of order by which the Lord governs the universe as King, are truths; but all the laws by which He governs the universe as Priest and by which also He rules truths themselves, are goods; for government from 
truths alone would condemn everyone to hell; but government from goods lifts everyone out thence and uplifts him into heaven (see n. 1728). Because in the Lord's case these two are conjoined, they 
were anciently represented by kingship conjoined with priesthood; as with Melchizedek, who was king of Salem and at the same time priest to God Most High (Gen. 14:18); and afterwards with the Jews, among 
whom the representative church was instituted in its own form, by judges and priests, and afterwards by kings.  [11] But as the kings represented truths, which ought not to have command, for the 
reason, as before said, that they condemn, therefore the desire to have kings was so displeasing as to call for rebuke, and the nature of truth as regarded in itself was described by the rights [jus] 
of the king (1 Sam. 8:11-18); and at an earlier day it was commanded by Moses (Deut. 17:14-18) that they should choose genuine truth which is from good, and not spurious; and that they should not defile 
it by reasonings and memory-knowledges [scientifica]. This is what is involved in the directions concerning a king, given in Moses in the place just cited; which no one can possibly see from the sense 
of the letter, but yet is evident from the several points contained in the internal sense; so that "king" and "kingship" evidently represented and signified nothing else than truth. </p>

<p align="center"><b>Elliott(1983-1999) 2015</b></p><p><b>2015.</b>
That 'kings will come out of you' means that all truth comes from Him is clear from the meaning of 'a king' as truth in both the historical and the prophetical sections of the Word, as stated in <a href="1672.htm">1672</a> 
but not yet shown to be so. From the meaning of 'nations' as goods, and from the meaning of 'kings' as truths, the nature of the internal sense of the Word becomes clear, and also how remote it is from 
the sense of the letter. No one reading the Word, especially the historical section, believes anything other than that 'nations' referred to there means nations, or that 'kings' there means kings, 
and therefore that the nations mentioned there, or the kings, are the real subject of the very Word itself. But when the idea of nations and also of kings reaches angels it perishes altogether, and good 
and truth take their place instead. This is bound to seem strange and indeed a paradox, but it is nevertheless the truth. The matter may also become clear to anyone from the fact that if nations were 
meant in the Word by 'nations' and kings by 'kings', the Word of the Lord would hardly embody anything more than some historical or other piece of writing and so would be something of a worldly nature, 
when in fact everything in the Word is Divine and so is celestial and spiritual. </p>
<p></p>
<p><b>[2]</b>
 Take merely the statement in the present verse about Abraham's being made fruitful, nations being made of him, 
and kings coming out of him. What else is this but something purely worldly and nothing at all heavenly? Indeed these assertions entail no more than the glory of this world, a glory which is absolutely 
nothing in heaven. But if this is the Word of the Lord then its glory must be that of heaven, not that of the world. This also is why the sense of the letter is completely erased and disappears 
when it passes into heaven, and is purified in such a way that nothing worldly at all is intermingled. For 'Abraham' is not used to mean Abraham but the Lord; nor is 'being fruitful' used to mean his 
descendants who would increase more and more but the endless growth of good belonging to the Lord's Human Essence. 'Nations' do not mean nations but goods, and 'kings' do not mean kings but truths. Nevertheless 
the narrative in the sense of the letter remains historically true, for Abraham was indeed spoken to in this way; and he was indeed made fruitful in this way, with nations as well as kings 
descending from him. </p>
<p></p>
<p><b>[3]</b>
 That 'kings' means truths becomes clear from the following places: In Isaiah, </p>
<blockquote>
The sons of the foreigner will build up your walls, and their kings will minister to you. You 
will suck the milk of nations, and the breast of kings will you suck. <a href="http://bible.gospelcom.net/cgi-bin/bible?passage=Isa%2060:10,%2016&amp;version=ESV&amp;interface=print&amp;showfn=yes&amp;showxref">Isa 60:10, 16</a>. 
</blockquote>
<p>What 'sucking the milk of nations and the breast of kings' means is not at all evident from the letter but from 
the internal sense, in which being endowed with goods and instructed in truths is meant. In Jeremiah, </p>
<blockquote>
There will enter through the gates of this city kings and princes seated on the throne of David, 
riding in chariots and on horses. <a href="http://bible.gospelcom.net/cgi-bin/bible?passage=Jer%2017:25;%2022:4&amp;version=ESV&amp;interface=print&amp;showfn=yes&amp;showxref">Jer 17:25; 22:4</a>. 
</blockquote>
<p>'Riding in chariots and on horses' is a prophecy meaning the abundance of things of the understanding, as becomes clear from very many places 
in the Prophets. Thus the prophecy that 'kings will enter through the gates of the city' means in the internal sense that they were to be endowed with truths of faith. This sense of the Word is the 
heavenly sense into which the worldly sense of the letter passes. </p>
<p></p>
<p><b>[4]</b>
 In the same prophet, </p>
<blockquote>
Jehovah has spurned in His fierce indignation king and priest. The gates of Zion have sunk into the ground, 
He has destroyed and broken in pieces her bars. King and princes are among the nations; the law is no more. <a href="http://bible.gospelcom.net/cgi-bin/bible?passage=Lam%202:6,%209&amp;version=ESV&amp;interface=print&amp;showfn=yes&amp;showxref">Lam 2:6, 9</a>. 
</blockquote>
<p>Here 'king' stands for the truth of faith, 'priest' for the good of charity, 
'Zion' for the Church, which is destroyed and its bars broken in pieces. Consequently 'king and princes among the nations', that is, truth and what belongs to truth, will be so completely banished 
that 'the law is no more', that is, nothing of the doctrine of faith will exist any more. In Isaiah, </p>
<blockquote>
Before the boy knows to refuse evil and to choose good, the ground will be abandoned which you 
loathe in the presence of its two kings. <a href="http://bible.gospelcom.net/cgi-bin/bible?passage=Isa%207:16&amp;version=ESV&amp;interface=print&amp;showfn=yes&amp;showxref">Isa 7:16</a>. 
</blockquote>
<p>This refers to the Lord's Coming. 'The land that will be abandoned' stands for faith which at that time would not exist. 'The kings' are the truths 
of faith which would be loathed. </p>
<p></p>
<p><b>[5]</b>
 In the same prophet, </p>
<blockquote>
I will lift up My hand to the nations and raise My ensign to the peoples; and they will bring your sons in their bosom, and your daughters 
will be carried on their shoulder. Kings will be your foster fathers and their queens your wet-nurses. <a href="http://bible.gospelcom.net/cgi-bin/bible?passage=Isa%2049:22,%2023&amp;version=ESV&amp;interface=print&amp;showfn=yes&amp;showxref">Isa 49:22, 23</a>. 
</blockquote>
<p>'Nations' and 'daughters' stand for goods, 'peoples' and 'sons' for truths, 
as shown in Volume One. That 'nations' stands for goods, <a href="1259.htm">1259</a>, <a href="1260.htm">1260</a>, <a href="1416.htm">1416</a>, <a href="1849.htm">1849</a>, as does 'daughters', <a href="489.htm">489</a>-<a href="491.htm">491</a>, while 'peoples' stands for truths, <a href="1259.htm">1259</a>, <a href="1260.htm">1260</a>, as does 'sons', <a href="489.htm">489</a>, <a href="491.htm">491</a>, <a href="533.htm">533</a>, <a href="1147.htm">1147</a>. 
'Kings' therefore stands for truths, in general by which they will be nourished, and 'queens' for goods by which they will be suckled. Whether you speak of goods and truths or of those who are governed 
by goods and truths it amounts to the same.  </p>
<p></p>
<p><b>[6]</b>
 In the same prophet, </p>
<blockquote>
He will spatter many nations, kings will shut their mouths because of him,<A name="fntext1"></a><A href="#fn1"><sup>a</sup></a> for that which has [not] been told them they 
have seen, and that which they have not heard they have understood. <a href="http://bible.gospelcom.net/cgi-bin/bible?passage=Isa%2052:15&amp;version=ESV&amp;interface=print&amp;showfn=yes&amp;showxref">Isa 52:15</a>. 
</blockquote>
<p>This refers to the Lord's Coming. 'Nations' stands for those who are stirred by an affection for goods, 'kings' those 
who are stirred by an affection for truths. In David, </p>
<blockquote>
Now, O kings, be intelligent; be instructed, O judges of the earth. Serve Jehovah with fear, and rejoice with trembling. Kiss the Son lest He 
perhaps be angry and you perish in the way. <a href="http://bible.gospelcom.net/cgi-bin/bible?passage=Ps%202:10-12&amp;version=ESV&amp;interface=print&amp;showfn=yes&amp;showxref">Ps 2:10-12</a>. 
</blockquote>
<p>'Kings' stands for people who are governed by truths, and who by virtue of truths are also in many places called 'king's sons'. 'The Son' here 
stands for the Lord, and he is called the Son here because he is Truth itself, and the source of all truth. </p>
<p></p>
<p><b>[7]</b>
 In John, </p>
<blockquote>
They will sing a new song, You are worthy to take the Book and to open 
its seals. You have made us kings and priests to our God so that we shall reign on the earth. <a href="http://bible.gospelcom.net/cgi-bin/bible?passage=Rev%205:9,%2010&amp;version=ESV&amp;interface=print&amp;showfn=yes&amp;showxref">Rev 5:9, 10</a>. 
</blockquote>
<p>Here people who are governed by truths are called 'kings'. The Lord also calls them 'the 
sons of the kingdom' in Matthew, </p>
<blockquote>
He who sows the good seed is the Son of Man, the field is the world, the seed are the sons of the kingdom, and the tares are the sons of the evil one. <a href="http://bible.gospelcom.net/cgi-bin/bible?passage=Matt%2013:37,%2038&amp;version=ESV&amp;interface=print&amp;showfn=yes&amp;showxref">Matt 13:37, 38</a>. 
</blockquote>
<p>In John, </p>
<blockquote>
The sixth angel poured out his bowl over the great river Euphrates and its water was dried up to prepare the way of the kings who were from the east. <a href="http://bible.gospelcom.net/cgi-bin/bible?passage=Rev%2016:12&amp;version=ESV&amp;interface=print&amp;showfn=yes&amp;showxref">Rev 16:12</a>. 
</blockquote>
<p>'Euphrates' clearly 
does not mean the Euphrates, nor does 'kings from the east' mean kings from that quarter. What 'Euphrates' does mean may be seen in <a href="120.htm">120</a>,<a href="1585.htm">1585</a>, <a href="1866.htm">1866</a>, from which it is evident that 'the way of the 
kings who were from the cast' means truths of faith that derive from goods of love. </p>
<p></p>
<p><b>[8]</b>
 In the same book, </p>
<blockquote>
The nations that are saved will walk in its light, and the kings of the earth will bring 
their glory and honour into it. <a href="http://bible.gospelcom.net/cgi-bin/bible?passage=Rev%2021:24&amp;version=ESV&amp;interface=print&amp;showfn=yes&amp;showxref">Rev 21:24</a>. 
</blockquote>
<p>Here 'nations' stands for people who are governed by goods, 'kings of the earth' for those who are governed by truths, which is also evident from the fact 
that the details here are prophetical, not historical. In the same book, </p>
<blockquote>
With the great harlot seated on many waters the kings of the earth have committed whoredom and have become drunk with the 
wine of her whoredom. <a href="http://bible.gospelcom.net/cgi-bin/bible?passage=Rev%2017:2&amp;version=ESV&amp;interface=print&amp;showfn=yes&amp;showxref">Rev 17:2</a>. 
</blockquote>
<p>And elsewhere in the same book, </p>
<blockquote>
Babylon has given all nations drink from the wine of the fury of her whoredom; and the kings of the earth have committed whoredom 
with her. <a href="http://bible.gospelcom.net/cgi-bin/bible?passage=Rev%2018:1,%203,%209&amp;version=ESV&amp;interface=print&amp;showfn=yes&amp;showxref">Rev 18:1, 3, 9</a>. 
</blockquote>
<p>Here similarly it is clear that 'the kings of the earth' does not mean kings, for the subject is the falsification and adulteration of the doctrine of faith, that is, of 
truth, which are 'whoredom'. 'Kings of the earth' stands for truths that have been falsified and adulterated. </p>
<p></p>
<p><b>[9]</b>
 In the same book, </p>
<blockquote>
The ten horns that you saw are ten kings who have not yet received 
a kingdom but are receiving authority as kings for one hour, together with the beast. These will be of one mind, and they will hand over power and authority to the beast. <a href="http://bible.gospelcom.net/cgi-bin/bible?passage=Rev%2017:12,%2013&amp;version=ESV&amp;interface=print&amp;showfn=yes&amp;showxref">Rev 17:12, 13</a>. 
</blockquote>
<p>That 
'kings' here does not mean kings may also be evident to anyone. If kings were meant, then 'ten kings receiving authority as kings for one hour' would be quite unintelligible, as similarly with the following 
words in the same book, </p>
<blockquote>
I saw the beast and the kings of the earth, and their armies gathered to make war with Him who was sitting on the horse, and with His army. <a href="http://bible.gospelcom.net/cgi-bin/bible?passage=Rev%2019:19&amp;version=ESV&amp;interface=print&amp;showfn=yes&amp;showxref">Rev 19:19</a> 
</blockquote>
<p>In verse 13 
of the same chapter it is stated explicitly that the One who was sitting on the horse was The Word of God, against which the kings of the earth are said to have been gathered. 'The beast' stands for 
goods of love that have been profaned, 'kings' for truths of faith that have been adulterated; these are called 'kings of the earth' because they exist within the Church - 'earth' meaning the Church, 
see <a href="662.htm">662</a>, <a href="1066.htm">1066</a>, <a href="1067.htm">1067</a>, <a href="1262.htm">1262</a>. 'The white horse' stands for the understanding of truth, 'He who was sitting on the horse' for the Word. This matter is plainer still in Daniel <a href="11.htm">11</a>, describing the war between 
the king of the south and the king of the north, by which is meant the conflict of truths with falsities. Here such conflicts are described as a war that took place in history. </p>
<p></p>
<p><b>[10]</b>
 Since 'a king' 
means truth, what is meant in the internal sense when the Lord is called King, and also a Priest, is made clear; and what essential quality of the Lord was represented by kings, and what by priests, 
is also made clear. 'Kings' represented His Divine Truth, and 'priests' His Divine Good. All the laws of order by which the Lord governs the universe as King are truths, while all the laws by which 
He governs the universe as Priest and by which He rules even over truths themselves are goods. For government from truths alone condemns everyone to hell, but government from goods lifts them out of that 
place and raises them up into heaven; see <a href="1728.htm">1728</a>. Because, in the Lord's case, these two - truths and goods - are joined together, they were also represented in ancient times by kingship and priesthood 
combined, as with Melchizedek who was at one and the same time king of Salem and priest to God Most High, <a href="http://bible.gospelcom.net/cgi-bin/bible?passage=Gen%2014:18&amp;version=ESV&amp;interface=print&amp;showfn=yes&amp;showxref">Gen 14:18</a>. And at a later time among the Jews where the representative Church was established 
in a form of its own He was represented by judges and priests, and after that by kings. </p>
<p></p>
<p><b>[11]</b>
 But because 'kings' represented truths which ought not to be paramount for the reason, already stated, 
that they condemn, the very idea was so objectionable that the Jews were reproached for it. The nature of truth regarded in itself has been described in <a href="http://bible.gospelcom.net/cgi-bin/bible?passage=1%20Sam%208:11-18&amp;version=ESV&amp;interface=print&amp;showfn=yes&amp;showxref">1 Sam 8:11-18</a>, as the rights of a king; and 
previous to that, in Moses, in <a href="http://bible.gospelcom.net/cgi-bin/bible?passage=Deut%2017:14-18&amp;version=ESV&amp;interface=print&amp;showfn=yes&amp;showxref">Deut 17:14-18</a>, they had been commanded through Moses to choose genuine truth deriving from good, not spurious truth, and not to pollute it with reasonings and factual 
knowledge. These are the considerations which the directive concerning a king given in the place in Moses referred to above embodies within itself. No one can possibly see this from the sense of the 
letter, but it is nevertheless evident from the details within the internal sense. This shows why 'a king' and 'kingship' represented and meant nothing other than truth.

Quod `reges ex te exibunt' significet quod ab Ipso omne verum, constat a significatione `regis' in Verbo tam historico quam prophetico quod sit verum, ut dictum n. 1672, sed nondum ita ostensum; ex 
significatione `gentium' quod sint bona, et (c)ex significatione `regum' quod sint vera, constare potest qualis est sensu: internus Verbi, tum quam remotus sit a sensu litterae: qui legit Verbum cumprimis 
historicum, nusquam aliter credit quam quod `gentes' ibi sint gentes, et `reges' ibi sint reges, et sic quod agatur de {1} gentibus in ipsissimo Verbo quae nominantur, deque regibus; sed idea gentium 
tum regum, prorsus perit cum excipitur ab angelis, et loco eorum succedit bonum et verum; hoc non potest non apparere ut peregrinum immo ut paradoxon, sed usque ita se habet; constare quoque cuivis 
potest ex eo, si in Verbo significarentur gentes per `gentes,' et rege: per `reges,' tunc Verbum Domini {2} vix plus involveret quam aliud quoddam historicum aut aliud scriptum et sic foret mundanum, 
cum tamen in Verbo nihil non est Divinum, ita caeleste et spirituale; [2] ut solum in hoc versu, quod `Abraham fructificaretur, et daretur in gentes atque reges ex illo exirent,' quid hoc nisi mere 
mundanum, et prorsus nihil caeleste; est enim in illis modo gloria mundi quae plane {3} nihil es in caelo; at si Verbum Domini, erit gloria caeli et nulla mundi; quare etiam sensus litterae prorsus obliteratur 
et evanescit cum transit in caelum, et purificatur ita {4} ut nihil mundani immixtum sit, nam per `Abraham' non intelligitur Abraham sed Dominus, per `fructificari non posteritas ejus quae 
cresceret in valde valde sed bonum Humanae Essentiae Domini in infinitum; per `gentes' non gentes sed bona; et per `reges' non reges sed vera; manente usque historico secundum sensum litterae in sua veritate, 
nam verum erat quod ita dictum Abrahamo, tum quod ita fructificatus, et quod fuerint gentes ex eo, tum etiam reges.  [3] Quod `reges' significent vera, constare potest (c)ex his locis: apud Esaiam, 	Aedificabunt 
filii alienigenae muros tuos, et reges eorum ministrabunt tibi;... suges lac gentium et uber regum suges, lx 10, 16; </p>
<p>quid `sugere lac gentium, et uber regum', nusquam patet ex littera 
sed ex sensu interno, in quo est donari bonis et instrui veris: apud Jeremiam, 	Intrabunt per portas civitatis hujus reges, et principes, sedentes super throno Davidis, equitantes curru et equis, 
xvii 25; xxii 4; </p>
<p>`equitare curru et equis' est propheticum, quod significat abundantiam intellectualium, ut a permultis apud Prophetas constare potest; ita quod `per portas civitatis intrabunt reges' 
(x)significetur in sensu interno quod imbuerentur veris fidei; hic Verbi sensus est caelestis in quem mundanus litterae transit: [4] apud eundem, 	Jehovah sprevit in indignatione irae Suae regem 
et sacerdotem... subsiderunt in terram portae Zionis, perdidit et confregit vectes ejus; rex et principes inter gentes, non lex, Thren. ii 6, 9; </p>
<p>ibi `rex' pro vero fidei: `sacerdos' pro bono charitatis: 
`Zion' pro Ecclesia, quae `perditur, et cujus vectes confringuntur': inde `rex et principes inter gentes,' hoc est, verum et illa quae sunt veri, exulabunt usque adeo ut `non sit lex,' hoc est, aliquid 
doctrinae fidei {5}: apud Esaiam, 	Antequam sciat puer reprobare malum, et eligere bonum, relinquetur humus, quam tu fastidis coram binis regibus suis, vii 16; </p>
<p>ubi de Adventu Domini: `humus quae 
relinquetur' pro fide quae tunc nulla, cujus vera sunt `reges' quae `fastidirentur': [5] apud eundem, Tollam ad gentes manum Meam, et ad populos exaltabo signum Meum, et afferent filios tuos in sinu, 
et filiae tuae super humero apportabuntur, erunt reges nutritii tui, et dominae eorum lactatrices tuae, xlix 22, 23; </p>
<p>`gentes et filiae' pro bonis; `populi et filii' pro veris, ut in Parte Prima 
ostensum; quod `gentes' pro bonis, n. 1259, 1260, 1416, 1849: quod `filiae' similiter, n. 489-491: `populi' pro veris, n. 1259, 1260; quod `filii' similiter, n. 489, 491, 533, 1147: `reges' itaque pro 
veris in genere ex quibus nutrientur, et `dominae' pro bonis ex quibus lactabuntur; sive dicas bona et vera, sive illos qui in bonis et veris, idem est: [6] apud eundem, 	(x) Asperget gentes multas, 
super illo compriment reges os suum, quia quod narratum est illis, viderunt, et quod non audiverunt, intellexerunt, lii 15; </p>
<p>ubi de Adventu Domini; {6} `gentes' pro illis qui bonis afficiuntur, `reges' 
pro illis qui veris': apud Davidem, 	Nunc reges intelligentes sitis, erudimini judices terrae; servite Jehovae in timore, et exsultate in tremore; osculamini Filium, ne forte irascatur, et pereatis 
in via, Ps. ii 10-12; </p>
<p>`reges' pro illis qui in veris sunt; qui quoque ex veris passim vocantur `filii regis'; `Filius' hic pro Domino, Qui hic Filius dicitur {7}, quia est ipsum Verum, et ab Ipso omne

qui in veris sunt, appellantur `reges'; Dominus etiam illos appellat filios regni, apud Matthaeum, 	Qui seminat bonum semen est Filius hominis, ager est mundus, semen sunt filii regni, et zizania 
sunt filii mali, xiii 37, 38: </p>
<p>apud Johannem, 	Sextus angelus effudit phialam suam super fluvium magnum Euphratem, cujus exsiccata est aqua, ut pararetur via regum, qui ab oriente solis, Apoc. xvi 12; </p>
<p>quod 
per `Euphratem' non significetur Euphrates, nec per `reges ab oriente solis' reges inde, constat; quid per `Euphratem,' videatur n. 120, 1585, 1866; inde patet quid `via regum qui ab oriente solis' 
quod sint vera fidei quae (c)a bonis amoris: [8] apud eundem, 	Gentes quae salvantur, in luce ejus ambulabunt, et reges terrae afferent gloriam et honorem suum in eam, Apoc. xxi 24; </p>
<p>ubi `gentes' 
pro illis qui sunt in bonis; `reges terrae' pro illis qui sunt in veris, quod etiam inde liquet quia ibi prophetica sunt non historica: apud eundem, 	Cum meretrice magna, sedente super aquis multis, 
scortati sunt reges terrae, et inebriati sunt vino scortationis ejus, Apoc. xvii 2: </p>
<p>et alibi, 	Babylon ex vino [furoris] scortationis suae potavit omnes gentes, et reges terrae cum ea scortati sunt, 
Apoc. xviii 1, 3, 9; </p>
<p>ibi similiter quod per `reges terrae' non significentur reges, constat, agitur enim de falsificatione et adulteratione doctrinae fidei, hoc est, veri, quae est `scortatio'; `reges 
terrae' pro veris quae falsificata et {8} adulterata: [9] apud eundem, 	Decem cornua quae vidisti, decem reges sunt, qui nondum regnum acceperunt, sed {9} potestatem tanquam reges {10} unam horam 
accipiunt cum bestia; hi unam mentem habebunt, et potentiam et potestatem suam tradent bestiae, Apoc. xvii 12, 13; </p>
<p>quod hic reges non sint reges, cuivis quoque patet, alioquin prorsus non {11} intelligibile 
foret quod `decem reges tanquam reges {10} unam horam potestatem {12} acciperent'; similiter quae apud eundem, 	Vidi bestiam et reges terrae, et exercitus eorum congregatos ad faciendum bellum 
cum sedente super equo, et cum exercitu ejus, Apoc. xix 19; </p>
<p>quod `sedens super equo' sit Verbum Dei, aperte dicitur, ibid. vers. 13, contra quod congregati dicuntur reges terrae; (m)`bestia' pro 
bonis amoris profanatis, `reges' pro veris fidei adulteratis; `reges terrae' dicuntur quia intra Ecclesiam; quod `terra' sit Ecclesia, n. 662, 1066, 1067, 1262; `equus albus' pro intellectu veri; `sedens 
super equo' pro Verbo. Adhuc manifestius apud Danielem, cap. xi, ubi agitur de bello inter `regem meridiei,' et `regem septentrionis,' per quae significantur vera et falsa quae pugnarunt; pugnae 
per bellum historice etiam ibi describuntur(n). [10] (s)Quia `rex' significat verum, constare potest quid in sensu interno sit quod Dominus dicatur Rex, tum etiam Sacerdos, ut et quid apud Dominum repraesentarunt 
reges, et quid sacerdotes; `reges' repraesentarunt Divinum Ipsius Verum, et `sacerdotes' Divinum Ipsius Bonum; omnes leges ordinis quibus Dominus gubernat universum ut Rex, sunt vera; omnes 
autem leges quibus gubernat universum ut Sacerdos et quibus etiam ipsa vera regit, sunt bona; nam regimen ex solis veris damnaret unumquemvis ad infernum, sed regimen ex bonis, tollit inde, et elevat 
in caelum, videatur n. 1728; quia haec bina apud Dominum sunt conjuncta, etiam antiquitus repraesentabatur per regium conjunctum sacerdotali, ut apud Malchizedekum qui fuit rex Shalem et simul sacerdos 
Deo Altissimo, Gen. xiv 18; et postea apud Judaeos ubi Ecclesia repraesentativa, in sua forma instituta, per judices et sacerdotes, dein per reges; [11] at quia `reges' repraesentarent vera, quae 
non imperare debuerunt, ex causa, ut dictum, quia damnant, ideo id {13} tantum displicuit ut increparentur, et descriptum quale sit verum in se spectatum, per jus regis, 1 Sam. viii 11-18, et prius per 
Mosen, Deut. xvii 14-18, mandatum quod eligerent verum genuinum quod ex bono, non spurium, et quod illud non ratiociniis et scientificis conspurcarent; haec sunt quae involvit praescriptio de rege 
apud Mosen loco citato, quod nusquam aliquis ex sensu litterae videre potest, sed usque patet ex singulis in sensu interno, et inde quod nihil aliud per `regem' et `regium' repraesentatum et significatum
