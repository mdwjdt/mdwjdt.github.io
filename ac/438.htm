<p><strong>[NCE]438.</strong> <a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_438/bible_king-james-version_genesis_4_26" target=_top>Genesis 4:26</a>. And to Seth in turn a son was born, and he called his name Enosh. Then people began to call on the name of Jehovah.<br />Seth symbolizes a faith that allows for the growth of charity, as noted. His son, whose name was Enosh, symbolizes a church that considered charity to be faith's principal concern. Then people began to call on the name of Jehovah symbolizes worship from charity in that church. </p>
<p align="center"><b>Potts(1905-1910) 438</b></p><p><b>438.</b>
Verse 26. And to Seth, to him also there was born a son; and he called his name Enosh: then began they to call upon the name of Jehovah. By "Seth" is signified the faith through which comes charity, 
as was said above; by his "son" whose name was "Enosh" is signified a church which regarded charity as the principal of faith; by beginning then to "call on the name of Jehovah" is signified the worship 
of that church from charity. </p>

Verse 26 And to Seth also was born a son, and he called his name Enosh; then they began to call on the name of Jehovah.  </p>
<p>'Seth', as has been stated, means faith through which charity may be received.'His 
son whose name was Enosh' means a Church which considered charity to be the primary element of faith. 'Then they began to call on the name of Jehovah' means that Church's worship deriving from charity.  </p>

</p><b>438.</b>
Vers. 26.  Et Shetho etiam illi natus est filius, et vocavit nomen ejus Enosh:  tunc coeptum est invocare nomen Jehovae, Per 'Sheth' significatur fides per quam charitas, ut dictum: per 'filium ejus, 
cujus nomen Enosh' significatur Ecclesia quae charitatem pro principali fidei habuit: quod 'tunc coeptum invocare nomen Jehovae' significat Ecclesiae istius cultum ex charitate. </p>
