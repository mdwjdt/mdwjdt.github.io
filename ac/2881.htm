<h3 align="center" class="ired">属天的奥秘 第2881节</h3>
<h4 align="center"></h4><p><strong>2881.</strong>若人能被强制改造，那么整个宇宙中早就没有不得救的人了。因为对主来说，再没有强迫人惧怕祂、敬拜祂、甚至可以说去爱祂更容易的事了；并且祂能使用的手段不计其数。但是，由于被迫所做的事联结不到人身上，从而变成他自己的，故主绝不强迫任何人。只要人陷入争战，也就是说，成了教会中的激进分子，表面上看，似乎是主逼迫那人，因此他没有任何自由；因为那时，他不断与对自我和这个世界的爱，因而与他生来所进入并在其中长大的自由争战；结果，如刚才所提到的，他似乎没有任何自由。然在他于其中得胜的争战中，他拥有的自由比试探之外的还要大。这种自由并非源于他自己，而是源于主，尽管看似是他自己的（参看<a href="1937.htm">1937</a>，<a href="1947.htm">1947</a>节）。</p>

If man could have been reformed by compulsion, there would not be any man in the universe who would not be saved; for nothing would be easier for the Lord than to compel man to fear Him, to worship Him, 
and indeed as it were to love Him; the means being innumerable. But as that which is done under compulsion is not conjoined, and thus is not appropriated, it is therefore the furthest possible from 
the Lord to compel anyone. So long as a man is in combats, or is one of the church militant, it appears as if the Lord compels the man, and thus that he has no freedom; for he is then continually combating 
against the love of self and of the world, thus against the freedom into which he was born and into which he has grown up; hence comes the appearance just referred to. But that in the combats 
in which he overcomes, the freedom is stronger than when out of combats (a freedom not from himself, but from the Lord, and still appearing as his), may be seen above (n. 1937, 1947). </p>

If it had been possible for man to be reformed under compulsion there would not be anyone at all in the universe who would not be saved. Nothing would in fact be easier for the Lord than to compel man 
to fear Him, to worship Him, or indeed so to speak to love Him. The means available to Him are countless. But because that which is done under compulsion is not joined to a person and so does not become 
his own, it is therefore quite alien to the Lord to compel anybody. As long as a person is engaged in conflicts, that is, is a member of the Church militant, it seems as though the Lord does compel 
that person and thus that he has no freedom; for he is at that time constantly battling against self-love and love of the world, and so against the freedom into which he was born and into which he 
has grown up, and as a consequence he seems, as just mentioned, to have no freedom. But in those conflicts in which he is victorious he possesses greater freedom than outside of them; yet this freedom 
does not originate in himself but in the Lord, though it still seems to be his own; see <a href="1937.htm">1937</a>, <a href="1947.htm">1947</a>. </p>

</p><b>2881.</b>
Si reformari potuisset homo ex coacto, non foret ullus homo in universo, qui non salvaretur; nihil enim facilius foret Domino quam cogere hominem ad timendum Ipsum, ad colendum Ipsum, immo ad quasi 
amandum Ipsum; media sunt innumerabilia; sed quia id quod fit in coacto, non conjungitur, ita non appropriatur, ideo a Domino longissime abest ut aliquem cogat. Quamdiu homo est in pugnis, seu unus ab 
Ecclesia pugnante, apparet sicut Dominus cogat hominem, et sic quod nullum ei liberum, pugnat enim tunc continue contra amorem sui et mundi, ita contra liberum in quod natus est et in quod adolevit, 
inde est quod ita appareat; sed quod in pugnis in quibus vincit, fortius liberum sit quam extra pugnas, sed liberum non ex ipso, sed Domino, et usque apparens {1}sicut ipsius, videatur n. 1937, 1947. @1 tanquam$ </p>
