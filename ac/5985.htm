<h3 align="center" class="ired">属天的奥秘 第5985节</h3>
<h4 align="center"></h4><p><strong>5985.</strong>一个使臣就是许多人的思维和言语集中所在的一个人，许多人以这种方式通过他呈现为一体。由于使臣的思维或言语无一源于他自己，而是来自其他人，他们的思维和言语在他身上得到生动表达，所以那些流入他的其他人以为他们的使臣如同虚无，几乎没有自己的任何生命，纯粹是他们自己的思维和言语的接受者。而另一方面，这个使臣却以为他的所思所言并非源于其他人，唯独源于他自己。所以双方都被蒙骗了。我常蒙允许告诉一个使臣说，他所思所言的一切，都不是源于他自己，而是来自其他人。我还说，这些其他人以为一个使臣不能独立思考或说话；因此，在他们看来，他就像一个根本没有自己生命的人。听到我所说的话，作为使臣的这个灵人极其愤怒。不过，为叫确信这一事实，我被允许与流入他的灵人交谈。他们坦承说，使臣所思所言的一切，无一来自他自己；因此，他们把他看成一个几乎没有自己任何生命的东西。还有一次，有一个声称使臣什么也不是的人自己成了一个使臣，然后其他人说他什么也不是，他对此大为恼火。然而，这次经历也让他明白了事情的真相。</p>

A Subject is one in whom are concentrated the thoughts and speech of many, and in this way many are presented as one. And as a subject thinks and speaks nothing whatever from himself, but from others, 
and the thoughts and speech of others are there presented to the life, therefore they who flow in suppose that the subject is as it were nothing and scarcely animate, being merely a receptive of their 
thought and speech. But on the other hand the subject supposes that he does not think and speak from others, but from himself alone. Thus fallacies delude both. It has often been given me to say to 
a subject that he thinks and speaks nothing from himself, but from others; and also that those others suppose that a subject cannot think and speak anything from himself; thus that he appears to them 
like one in whom there is nothing of life from himself. Upon hearing this the spirit who was the subject was very indignant. But in order that he might be convinced of the truth, it was given to speak 
with the spirits who were flowing in, who then confessed that a subject thinks and speaks nothing whatever from himself, and thus that he appears to them to be something scarcely animate. It also once 
happened that he who said that a subject is nothing, himself became a subject, and then the rest said of him that he was nothing, at which he was greatly enraged, and yet was thereby instructed how 
the case is. </p>

A subordinate is one through whom the thoughts and utterances of many are focused and is accordingly the means by which many present themselves as a single unit. Also, since none of the subordinate's 
thoughts or speech originate in himself but come from others, and their thoughts and speech find vivid expression in him, those others who enter him suppose that their subordinate is a kind of nonentity 
with hardly any life of his own, a mere receiver of their own thought and speech. And for his part the subordinate imagines that what he thinks and utters originates not in others, but solely in himself. 
Thus both parties are deluded. I have often been allowed to tell a subordinate that nothing he thinks or speaks originates in himself but comes from others. I have also said that those others 
imagine that a subordinate is incapable of independent thought or speech, so that it seems to them as though he has no life at all of his own. Having heard what I said one who was a subordinate was highly 
indignant. But in order that he might be convinced I was allowed to talk to the spirits who were entering him. They confessed and said that nothing at all of what a subordinate thinks or speaks comes 
from himself, which being so they see him as a thing with hardly any life of its own. It also happened on one occasion that someone who said a subordinate was a nonentity became a subordinate himself, 
at which point the rest declared that he was a nonentity, which made him extremely angry. Even so the experience taught him the truth of the matter. </p>

Subjectum est in quo concentrantur plurium cogitationes et loquelae, et sic plures sistuntur ut unus; et quia subjectum nihil prorsus ex se cogitat aut loquitur sed ex aliis, et aliorum cogitationes 
et loquelae sistuntur ibi ad vivum, idcirco putant illi qui influunt quod subjectum sit quasi nihil {1}et vix animatum, modo receptivum cogitationis et loquelae illorum; subjectum autem vicissim putat 
quod non ab aliis sed ex se solo cogitet et loquatur; ita fallaciae ludunt utrinque.  Saepius datum est dicere ad subjectum quod is nihil ex se cogitet et loquatur sed ex aliis; et quoque quod alii 
illi putent subjectum non posse aliquid ex se cogitare et loqui, ita apparere illis sicut in quo nihil vitae a se; quibus auditis is qui fuit subjectum, valde indignatus est; sed ut de veritate convinceretur, 
loqui datum est cum spiritibus qui influebant, qui tunc fassi dicebant quod subjectum prorsus nihil cogitet et loquatur ex se, et sic quod appareat illis {2}vix ut animatum quoddam.  Contigit 
etiam quondam quod ille qui dicebat subjectum esse nihil, factus sit subjectum, et tunc ceteri dicebant de eo quod is nihil esset, quo maximopere iratus est; sed usque per id instructus {3}quomodo se 
res habet. @1 aut quoddam inanimatum$ @2 sicut inanimatum$ @3 i est$ </p>
