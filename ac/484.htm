<h4 align="center"></h4><p><strong>484.</strong>被称为“塞特”的教会与上古教会非常相似，这可从“形像样式和自己相似，就给他起名叫塞特”的经文清楚看出来。“样式”与信相关，“形像”与爱相关。该教会在爱及其衍生之信方面与上古教会不尽相同，这从刚才所说的经文明显可知，“并且造男造女。在他们被造的日子，神赐福给他们，称其名为人”表第六日的属灵之人，也就是说，爱还没有如此至高无上，但信仍与爱相联。</p>

<p><strong>[NCE]484.</strong> The fact that the church called Seth shared a close similarity with the earliest church can be seen from the fact that it says the human fathered [a child] in his likeness, after his image, and called his name Seth. The likeness has to do with faith and the image with love. This church, you see, was not like the earliest church in loving, and therefore believing in, the Lord, as can be seen from the statement just above, "Male and female he created them, and he blessed them and called their name Human" [<a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_484/bible_king-james-version_genesis_5_2" target=_top>Genesis 5:2</a>]. These words, as noted above [<a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_484/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_476" target=_top>476</a>], symbolize the spiritual person of the sixth day, so that Seth's likeness was to the spiritual person of the sixth day. In other words, love was not so much the primary concern in this church, yet faith was still bound up with love. </p>

That the church called "Seth" was very nearly like the Most Ancient Church, is evident from its being said that the man begat in his likeness, according to his image, and called his name Seth; the term 
"likeness" having relation to faith, and "image" to love; for that this church was not like the Most Ancient Church with regard to love and its derivative faith, is plain from its being said just before, 
"Male and female created He them, and blessed them, and called their name Man" by which is signified the spiritual man of the sixth day, as was said above, so that the likeness of this man was 
to the spiritual man of the sixth day, that is, love was not so much the principal, but still faith was conjoined With love. </p>

<p align="center"><b>Elliott(1983-1999) 484</b></p><p><b>484.</b>
The Church called 'Seth' was very similar to the Most Ancient Church. This is clear from the statement that 'Man beget in his own likeness, according to his own Image, and called his name Seth'. 'Likeness' 
has regard to faith and 'image' to love. That it was not in fact the same as the Most Ancient Church so far as love to the Lord and faith deriving from that love were concerned is clear from the 
statement immediately previous, 'Male and female He created them, blessed them, and called their name Man', meaning the spiritual man of the sixth day, as stated already. The likeness of this man was 
to the spiritual man of the sixth day, that is, love was not so much supreme, but faith was still joined to love.  </p>

<p align="center"><b>Latin(1748-1756) 484</b>
</p><b>484.</b>
Quod Ecclesia quae 'Sheth' dicta, proxime similis fuerit Ecclesiae Antiquissimae, constat inde quod dicatur quod 'Homo genuerit in similitudinem suam, secundum imaginem suam, et vocavit nomen ejus Sheth'; 
'similitudo' spectat fidem et 'imago' amorem, nam quod non fuerit sicut Antiquissima Ecclesia quoad amorem et inde fidem in Dominum, constat ex eo quod mox prius dicat 'Masculum et feminam creavit 
illos, benedixit illis, et vocavit nomen illorum Homo,' quibus significatur homo spiritualis sexti diei, ut prius dictum; quare similitudo ejus fuit, sicut spiritualis sexti diei quod est quod amor 
non ita principale fuit, sed usque quod fides amori conjuncta. </p>
