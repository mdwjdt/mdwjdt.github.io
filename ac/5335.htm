<h3 align="center" class="ired">属天的奥秘 第5335节</h3>
<h4 align="center"></h4><p><strong>5335.</strong>“约瑟年三十岁”表余剩的数量完整之时的状态。这从“三十”和“岁”的含义清楚可知：“三十”是指余剩的完整数目，如下文所述；“岁”（即年）是指状态（参看<a href="482.htm">482</a>，<a href="487.htm">487</a>，<a href="488.htm">488</a>，<a href="493.htm">493</a>，<a href="893.htm">893</a>节）。在圣言中，“三十”这个数字表示些许争战的存在，还表示余剩的完整数目。它之所以具有这种双重含义，是因为它是由五和六，或三和十相乘得来的。当是五和六的乘积时，它表示些许争战的存在（<a href="2276.htm">2276</a>节），因为“五”表示些许（<a href="4638.htm">4638</a>，<a href="5291.htm">5291</a>节），“六”表示争战（<a href="720.htm">720</a>，<a href="730.htm">730</a>，<a href="737.htm">737</a>，<a href="900.htm">900</a>，<a href="1709.htm">1709</a>节）；但当是三和十的乘积时，它表示余留的完整数目，因为“三”表示完整之物（<a href="2788.htm">2788</a>，<a href="4495.htm">4495</a>节），“十”表示余剩（<a href="576.htm">576</a>，<a href="1906.htm">1906</a>，<a href="2284.htm">2284</a>节）。一个复合数含有与构成它的简单数差不多的意思（参看<a href="5291.htm">5291</a>）。余剩是指已被主储存在人之内层的联结于良善的真理（参看<a href="468.htm">468</a>，<a href="530.htm">530</a>，<a href="560.htm">560</a>，<a href="561.htm">561</a>，<a href="576.htm">576</a>，<a href="660.htm">660</a>，<a href="1050.htm">1050</a>，<a href="1738.htm">1738</a>，<a href="1906.htm">1906</a>，<a href="2284.htm">2284</a>，<a href="5135.htm">5135</a>节）。<br />在马可福音中，“三十”、“六十”和“一百”也表示余剩的完整数字：<br />又有落在好土里的种子，就发生长大，结着果实，结成了三十倍的，六十倍的，一百倍的。（马可福音<a href="http://39-27.cn/可4.8.htm">4:8</a>，<a href="http://39-27.cn/可4.20.htm">20</a>）<br />由于所有这些数字都乘以十得来的，所以它们表示余剩的完整数目。还由于人在接受余剩的完整数目之前，无法重生，也就是被允许进入藉以实现重生的属灵试探，所以经上规定利未人未年满三十岁不可在会幕里办事，这些事或职责也被称为“任职”，如我们在摩西五经所读到的：<br />你从利未人中，将哥辖子孙的总数，从三十岁直到五十岁，凡前来任职在会幕里办事的，全都计算。（民数记<a href="http://39-27.cn/民4.2.htm">4:2</a>-<a href="http://39-27.cn/民4.3.htm">3</a>）<br />论到哥顺子孙、米拉利子孙的话也一样（民数记<a href="http://39-27.cn/民4.22.htm">4:22</a>-<a href="http://39-27.cn/民4.23.htm">23</a>，<a href="http://39-27.cn/民4.29.htm">29</a>-<a href="http://39-27.cn/民4.30.htm">30</a>，<a href="http://39-27.cn/民4.35.htm">35</a>，<a href="http://39-27.cn/民4.39.htm">39</a>，<a href="http://39-27.cn/民4.43.htm">43</a>）。大卫登基作王时年三十岁含有类似事物（撒母耳记下<a href="http://39-27.cn/撒下5.4.htm">5:4</a>）。由此可见为何主直到三十岁才为人所知（路加福音<a href="http://39-27.cn/路3.23.htm">3:23</a>），因为在那个年纪，余剩的完整数目才存在于祂里面；只是主所拥有的这些余剩是祂自己为自己获得的。它们也是神性余剩，主凭借它们将人身本质与神性本质联结起来，并使得这人身本质变成神性（<a href="1906.htm">1906</a>节）。“三十岁”表示当余剩的数量完整之时的状态，以及利未人年满三十岁才开始履行他们的特定职责，就是从祂来的。由于大卫要代表主的王权，所以他也是等到三十岁才登基作王。因为一切代表皆源于主，故一切代表皆与主有关。</p>

<p align="center"><b>Potts(1905-1910) 5335</b></p><p><b>5335.</b>
And Joseph was a son of thirty years. That this signifies a full state of remains, is evident from the signification of "thirty," as being full of remains (of which below); and from the signification 
of "years," as being states (see n. 482, 487, 488, 493, 893). The number "thirty" in the Word signifies somewhat of combat, and it also signifies full of remains. The reason why it has this twofold signification, 
is that it is composed of five and six multiplied together, and also of three and ten so multiplied. From five multiplied by six it signifies somewhat of combat (n. 2276), because "five" 
signifies somewhat (n. 4638, 5291), and "six" combat (n. 720, 730, 737, 900, 1709); but from three multiplied by ten it signifies full of remains, because "three" signifies what is full (n. 2788, 4495), 
and "ten" remains (n. 576, 1906, 2284); that a compound number involves the like as its components, see n. 5291. (That remains are the truths joined to good stored up by the Lord in man's interiors, 
see n. 468, 530, 560, 561, 576, 660, 1050, 1738, 1906, 2284, 5135.)  [2] A fullness of remains is signified also by "thirty," by "sixty," and by a "hundred," in Mark: </p>
<p>	The seed that fell into the 
good ground yielded fruit that sprang up and increased, and brought forth, one thirty, and another sixty, and another a hundred (Mark 4:8, 20); </p>
<p>as all these numbers arise from ten by multiplication, 
they signify a fullness of remains. And as man cannot be regenerated, that is, be admitted to the spiritual combats through which regeneration is effected, until he has received remains to the full, 
it was ordained that the Levites should not do any work in the tent of meeting until they had completed thirty years, which work or function is also called "warfare," as we read in Moses: </p>
<p>	Take the sum 
of the sons of Kohath from the midst of the sons of Levi, from a son of thirty years and upward to a son of fifty years, everyone that cometh to the warfare, to do the work in the tent of meeting (Num. 
4:2-3). Something similar is said of the sons of Gershon, and of the sons of Merari (Num. 4:22-23, 29-30, 35, 39, 43). The like is involved in David's being thirty years old when he began to reign 
(2 Sam. 5:4). [3] From all this it is now plain why the Lord did not manifest Himself until He was thirty years of age (Luke 3:23); for He was then in the fullness of remains. But the remains the 
Lord had He Himself procured for Himself, and they were of the Divine; and by means of them He united the Human essence to the Divine essence, and made the Human essence Divine (n. 1906). From Him then 
it is that "thirty years" signify a full state as to remains, and that the priests the Levites entered upon their functions when they were thirty years old, and that David, because he was to represent 
the Lord as to the royalty, did not begin to reign until he was thirty; for every representative is derived from the Lord, and therefore every representative looks to the Lord. </p>

<p align="center"><b>Elliott(1983-1999) 5335</b></p><p><b>5335.</b>
'And Joseph was a son of thirty years' means a state when the quantity of remnants was complete. This is clear from the meaning of 'thirty' as a completed number of remnants, dealt with below, and from 
the meaning of 'years' as states, dealt with in <a href="482.htm">482</a>, <a href="487.htm">487</a>, <a href="488.htm">488</a>, <a href="493.htm">493</a>, <a href="893.htm">893</a>. In the Word the number thirty can mean some existence of conflict, or else it can mean a completed number o: remnants. The reason 
why that number has this twofold meaning is that it is arrived at by multiplying five and six, or else by multiplying three and ten. When it is the product of five times six it means some existence 
of conflict, <a href="2276.htm">2276</a>, because 'five' means some, <a href="649.htm">649</a>, <a href="4638.htm">4638</a>, <a href="5291.htm">5291</a>, and 'six' conflict, <a href="720.htm">720</a>, <a href="737.htm">737</a>, <a href="900.htm">900</a>, <a href="1709.htm">1709</a>. But when thirty is the product of three times ten it means a completed number of remnants, because 
'three' means that which is complete, <a href="2788.htm">2788</a>, <a href="4495.htm">4495</a>, and 'ten' means remnants, <a href="576.htm">576</a>, <a href="1906.htm">1906</a>, <a href="2284.htm">2284</a>. A composite number implies much the same as the simple ones of which it is the product, <a href="5291.htm">5291</a>. Remnants 
are the truths joined to good which have been stored away by the Lord in a person's interior parts, see <a href="468.htm">468</a>, <a href="530.htm">530</a>, <a href="560.htm">560</a>, <a href="561.htm">561</a>, <a href="576.htm">576</a>, <a href="660.htm">660</a>, <a href="1050.htm">1050</a>, <a href="1738.htm">1738</a>, <a href="1906.htm">1906</a>, <a href="2284.htm">2284</a>, <a href="5135.htm">5135</a>. </p>
<p></p>
<p><b>[2]</b>
 A completed number of remnants 
is likewise meant by 'thirty' - as it is also by 'sixty', and by 'a hundred' too - in Mark, </p>
<blockquote>
The seed which fell into good ground yielded fruit growing up and increasing. One bore thirty-fold, 
and another sixty, and another a hundred. <a href="http://bible.gospelcom.net/cgi-bin/bible?passage=Mark%204:8,%2010&amp;version=ESV&amp;interface=print&amp;showfn=yes&amp;showxref">Mark 4:8, 10</a>. 
</blockquote>
<p>Each of these numbers, being a multiple of ten, means a completed number of remnants. Also, because no one can be regenerated - that is, permitted 
to enter into spiritual temptations, by means of which regeneration is effected - until he has received a completed number of remnants, it was therefore laid down that no Levite should carry out 
any work in the tent of meeting until he was fully thirty years old. Their work or function is also called 'military service', being referred to in Moses as follows, </p>
<blockquote>
Take a census of the sons of Kohath 
from the midst of the sons of Levi - from sons thirty years of age and over, up to sons fifty years of age, everyone coming to perform military service, to do the work in the tent of meeting. <a href="http://bible.gospelcom.net/cgi-bin/bible?passage=Num%204:2,%203&amp;version=ESV&amp;interface=print&amp;showfn=yes&amp;showxref">Num 4:2, 3</a>. 
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
Much the same is said regarding the sons of Gershon, and much the same regarding the sons of Merari, in verses 22, 23, 29, 30, and then in verses 35, 39, 43. Of that same chapter in Moses. 
And something similar is implied where it says that David began to reign when he was a son thirty years of age, <a href="http://bible.gospelcom.net/cgi-bin/bible?passage=2%20Sam%205:4&amp;version=ESV&amp;interface=print&amp;showfn=yes&amp;showxref">2 Sam 5:4</a>.  
</blockquote>
<p></p>
<p><b>[3]</b>
 From all this one may now see why the Lord did not make Himself known 
until He was thirty years of age, <a href="http://bible.gospelcom.net/cgi-bin/bible?passage=Luke%203:23&amp;version=ESV&amp;interface=print&amp;showfn=yes&amp;showxref">Luke 3:23</a>. At that age a completed number of remnants existed with Him, though these remnants which the Lord possessed were ones that He Himself had acquired for 
Himself. They were also Divine ones and the means by which He united His Human Essence to His Divine Essence and made that Human Essence Divine, <a href="1906.htm">1906</a>. In Him therefore lies the reason why 'thirty years' 
means a state when the quantity of remnants is complete and why the priests the Levites began to perform their specific functions when they were thirty years old. And because he was to represent the 
Lord's kingship, David did not begin to reign until he was that same age. For every representative is derived from the Lord, and therefore every representative has reference to Him. </p>

`Et Joseph filius triginta annorum': quod significet statum plenum reliquiarum, constat ex significatione `triginta' quod sit plenum reliquiarum, de qua sequitur; et ex significatione `annorum' quod 
sint status, de qua n. 482, 487, 488, 493, 893; numerus `triginta' significat in Verbo aliquid pugnae, et quoque significat plenum reliquiarum; quod duplex ei significatio sit, causa est quia componitur 
ex quinque et sex in se multiplicatis, et quoque componitur ex tribus et decem in se {1}etiam multiplicatis; ex quinque in sex ductis, significat aliquid pugnae, n. 2276, quia `quinque' significant 
aliquid, n. 649, 4638, 5291, et `sex' pugnam, n. 720, 737, 900, 1709; at ex tribus in decem ductis significat plenum reliquiarum quia `tria' significant plenum, n. 2788, 4495, et `decem' reliquias, 
n. 576, 1906, 2284; quod numerus compositus simile involvat cum simplicibus ex quibus, n. 5291; `reliquiae' quod sint vera {2}juncta bono in interioribus apud hominem a Domino recondita, videatur n. 468, 
530, 560, 561, 576, 660, 1050, 1738, 1906, 2284, 5135. [2] Plenitudo reliquiarum etiam significatur per triginta, et quoque per sexaginta, {3}ut et per centum, apud Marcum, Semen quod cecidit in 
terram bonam, dedit fructum ascendentem et crescentem, et tulit unum triginta, et alterum sexaginta, et alterum centum, iv 8, 20;  omnes hi tres numeri, quia per multiplicationem assurgunt a decem, significant 
plenitudinem reliquiarum.  Et quia homo non prius regenerari potest, hoc est, admitti in pugnas spirituales per quas fit regeneratio quam cum reliquias ad plenum acceperit, idcirco statutum 
quod Levitae non prius facerent opus in tentorio conventus quam cum impleverint triginta annos; opus illorum seu functio vocatur quoque `militia'; de quibus ita apud Mosen, Tolle summam filiorum Kehathi 
e medio filiorum Levi, . . . a filio triginta annorum et supra, ad filium quinquaginta annorum, omnem venientem ad militiam, ad faciendum opus in tentorio conventus, Num. iv (x)2, 3; </p>
<p>similiter dicitur 
de filiis Gershonis, et similiter de filiis Merari, ibid. vers. 22, 23, 29, 30, ac iterum, vers. 35, 39, 43. (m)Simile {4} involvit quod  David, cum filius triginta annorum esset, regnare ceperit, 
2 Sam. v (x)4.(n)  [3] Ex his nunc patet cur Dominus non prius quam cum esset triginta annorum, se manifestaverit, Luc. iii (x)23, tunc enim in plenitudine reliquiarum fuit, at reliquiae quas Dominus 
habuit, Ipse Sibi comparaverat, et fuerunt {5}Divinae, per quas univit Essentiam Humanam Divinae, et illam Divinam fecit, n. 1906; ex Ipso {6}nunc est quod `triginta anni' significent statum plenum 
quoad reliquias, et quod sacerdotes Levitae functiones suas ingressi cum fuerunt aetate triginta annorum, et quia David repraesentaturus erat Dominum quoad regium, quod ille nec prius regnare ceperit; 
omne enim repraesentativum ducitur a Domino, et inde omne repraesentativum spectat Dominum. @1 quoque$ @2 juxta bono I$ @3 et ut I$ @4 i etiam$ @5 Divino I$ @6 etiam$ </p>
