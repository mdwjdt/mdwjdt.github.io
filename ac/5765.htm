<h3 align="center" class="ired">属天的奥秘 第5765节</h3>
<h4 align="center"></h4><p><strong>5765.</strong>创世记44:11，12.于是他们各人急忙把口袋卸下在地上，各人打开口袋。他就搜查，从最年长的起，到最年幼的为止，那杯竟在便雅悯的口袋里找着了。<br />“于是他们急忙”表没有耐心，不愿等待。“各人把口袋卸下在地上”表他们将属世层所含之物带到感官事物或感官印象的层面。“各人打开口袋”表以便他们能由此把事情说清楚。“他就搜查”表调查。“从最年长的起，到最年幼的为止”表次序。“那杯竟在便雅悯的口袋里找着了”表来自属天层的内层真理与居间层同在。</p>

Verses 11, 12. And they hastened, and they made everyone his bag come down to the earth, and opened every man his bag. And he searched; he began at the eldest, and left off at the youngest; and the cup 
was found in Benjamin's bag. "And they hastened," signifies impatience; "and made everyone his bag come down to the earth," signifies that they brought what was in the natural down to things of sense; 
"and opened every man his bag," signifies that they might thus make the matter manifest to themselves; "and he searched," signifies investigation; "he began at the eldest, and left off at the youngest," 
signifies order; "and the cup was found in Benjamin's bag," signifies that interior truth from the celestial was with the intermediate. </p>

Verses 11, 12 And they hurried and caused to come down, each one his pouch to the earth; and they opened, each one his pouch. And he searched; he began with the oldest and finished with the youngest. 
And the cup was found in Benjamin's pouch. </p>
<p>'And they hurried' means an unwillingness to wait. 'And caused to comedown, each one his pouch to the earth' means that they brought the contents of the 
natural down to the level of sensory impressions. 'And they opened, each one his pouch' means so that they might thereby make the matter clear to themselves. 'And he searched' means an investigation.' 
He began with the oldest and finished with the youngest' means order. 'And the cup was found in Benjamin's pouch' means that interior truth from the celestial existed with the intermediary. </p>

Vers. 11, 12.  Et festinarunt, et descendere fecerunt quisque manticam suam terram, et aperuerunt quisque manticam suam. Et scrutatus est, in maximo incepit et in minimo absolvit, et inventus scyphus 
in mantica Benjaminis.  `Et festinarunt' significat impatientiam:  `et descendere fecerunt quisque manticam suam terram' significat quod adduxerint illa quae in naturali usque ad sensualia:  `et aperuerunt 
quisque manticam suam' significat ut sic sibi rem manifestarent:  `et scrutatus est' significat investigationem:  `in maximo incepit et in minimo absolvit' significat ordinem:  `et inventus scyphus 
in mantica Benjaminis' significat quod verum interius a caelesti apud medium. </p>
