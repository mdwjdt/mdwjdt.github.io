<h3 align="center" class="ired">属天的奥秘 第7878节</h3>
<h4 align="center"></h4><p><strong>7878.</strong>“就越过你们去”表它，即来自地狱的诅咒，会远离那里。这从“越过”的含义清楚可知，“越过”在论及诅咒时，是指远离那里。此餐，从地狱流出的诅咒气场远离那些处于来自主的真理和良善之人。诅咒会流入那些沉浸于邪恶和虚假的人中间，因为那里有一种接受该气场的状态；但该气场不流入那些处于真理和良善的人中间，因为这些事物是对立面，这一个会远离那一个。到目前为止，关于逾越节的羔羊、烤着吃、以及取它的一点血涂在门框和门楣上所规定的这一切都与这些有关，即：灭命的将越过他们的房屋；在内义上表示他们将摆脱一切诅咒。为了这个目的，即诅咒能远离他们，他们已经做好预备。关于逾越节羔羊的条例在内义上就描述了预备的过程。</p>

<p align="center"><b>Potts(1905-1910) 7878</b></p><p><b>7878.</b>
And I will pass over you. That this signifies that it will flee from thence, namely, the damnation which is from the hells will do so, is evident from the signification of "passing over," when this is 
said of damnation, as being to flee from thence. Moreover, the sphere of damnation which flows forth from the hells, flees past those who are in truth and good from the Lord; for damnation flows in 
with those who are in evil and falsity, because there is a state of reception there; but not with those who are in truth and good, for these are opposites, one of which flees from the other.      All 
things which have been thus far ordained with respect to the paschal lamb, with respect to the roasting and eating of it, also with respect to the blood upon the posts and lintel, bear relation to these; 
namely, that the destroyer will pass by their houses; in the internal sense, that they shall be free from all damnation. For the sake of this end, namely, that damnation should flee from them, they 
had been prepared. The process of preparation is what in the internal sense is described by the statutes concerning the paschal lamb. </p>

<p align="center"><b>Elliott(1983-1999) 7878</b></p><p><b>7878.</b>
'And pass you by' means that it - damnation from the hells - will stay away from there. This is clear from the meaning of 'passing by', when used in reference to damnation, as staying away from there. 
Also the sphere of damnation which flows out of the hells stays away from those guided by truth and governed by good from the Lord. Damnation enters in among those steeped in evil and falsity, since 
a state receptive of that sphere exists there, but not among those guided and governed by truth and good; for those things are opposites, one of which stays away from the other. All that has been decreed 
so far about the Passover lamb, about the cooking and eating of it, and also about putting some of its blood onto doorposts and lintel, is connected with this declaration that the destroyer will 
pass their houses by, meaning in the internal sense that they will be free from all damnation. To this end, that damnation might stay away from them, they had been made ready. The process of being made 
ready is what is described in the internal sense by the statutes regarding the Passover lamb. </p>

</p><b>7878.</b>
`Et praeteribo praeter vos': quod significet quod fugiet inde, nempe damnatio quae ab infernis, constat ex significatione `praeterire' cum hoc dicitur de damnatione, quod sit fugere inde; etiam damnationis 
sphaera, quae ex infernis effluit, praeter illos qui a Domino in vero et bono sunt, fugit; damnatio enim influit apud illos qui in malo et falso sunt, nam status receptionis ibi est, non autem 
apud illos qui in vero et bono {1}; sunt enim opposita, quorum unum fugit alterum.  Omnia quae hactenus statuta sunt de agno paschali, de ejus coctione et esu, tum de sanguine super postes et superliminare, 
se referunt ad haec, quod nempe perditor {2}praeteribit illorum domos; in sensu interno quod ab omni damnatione immunes erunt; propter hunc finem, ut nempe damnatio ab illis fugeret, praeparati 
sunt; praeparationis processus est qui in sensu interno per statuta de agno paschali descriptus est. 	@1 i sunt but possibly d$ 	@2 domus illorum praeteribit$ </p>
