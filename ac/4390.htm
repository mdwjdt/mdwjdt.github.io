<h3 align="center" class="ired">属天的奥秘 第4390节</h3>
<h4 align="center"></h4><p><strong>4390.</strong>“在那里为自己盖造房屋”表在那种状态下，源自真理的良善的增长。这从“盖造房屋”的含义清楚可知，“盖造房屋”是指在聪明和智慧上教导外在人（参看<a href="1488.htm">1488</a>节）。由于聪明属于真理，智慧属于良善，故“盖造房屋”在此表示出自真理的良善的增长。“房屋”表示良善（参看<a href="2233.htm">2233</a>，<a href="2234.htm">2234</a>，<a href="3128.htm">3128</a>，<a href="3142.htm">3142</a>，<a href="3652.htm">3652</a>，<a href="3720.htm">3720</a>节）。至于何为真理的良善，前面早已阐述过（<a href="4337.htm">4337</a>，<a href="4353.htm">4353</a>节），即真理的良善就是意愿和行为中的真理。这真理就是那被称为良善的，出自这良善的良知或良心被称为真理的良知或良心。源自真理的这良善会随着人出于行善的渴望操练仁爱的程度，因而随着他爱邻舍的程度和方式而增长。<br />之所以在解释中多次提到良善和真理，是因为天上的一切事物，因而主教会中的一切，皆与真理并良善有关。一般来说，这二者包括属于教义和生活的一切事物；真理就是属于教义的一切事物；良善就是属于生活的一切事物。此外，一个普遍的事实是，人类心智所拥有的其思维和渴望的对象无不涉及真理或良善；理解中的思维涉及真理，意愿中的渴望涉及良善。由此明显可知，真理与良善具有十分广泛的意义，其衍生物在数量上也是无以言表的。这就是为何真理与良善经常被提及的原因。</p>

And built him a house. That this signifies the increase of good from truth in that state, is evident from the signification of "building a house," as being to instruct the external man in intelligence 
and wisdom (see n. 1488). And as intelligence belongs to truth, and wisdom to good, by "building a house" is here signified the increase of good from truth. (That a "house" denotes good may be seen 
above, n. 2233, 2234, 3128, 3142, 3652, 3720.) What the good of truth is, has been already stated (n. 4337, 4353), namely, that it is truth in will and act. This truth is what is called good, and the 
conscience which is from this good is called a conscience of truth. This good which is from truth increases in proportion as the man exercises charity from willing well, thus in proportion and in such 
a manner as he loves the neighbor. [2] The reason why good and truth are mentioned so frequently in the explications, is that all things in heaven, and consequently all in the Lord's church, bear relation 
to good and truth. Speaking generally these two include all things that belong to doctrine and to life; truths, all things that belong to doctrine; and goods, all things that belong to life. Moreover, 
it is a universal fact that the human mind has no other objects than those which are of truth and good; its understanding, those which are of truth; and its will, those which are of good. Hence 
it is evident that truth and good are terms of the widest signification, and that their derivations are unutterable in number. This is the reason why truth and good are so often mentioned. </p>

'And built a house for himself means an increase of good from truth within that state. This is clear from the meaning of 'building a house' as providing the external man with intelligence and wisdom, 
dealt with in <a href="1488.htm">1488</a>. And because intelligence is essentially truth, and wisdom is essentially good, 'building a house' here means an increase of good from truth. 'A house' means good, see <a href="2233.htm">2233</a>, <a href="2234.htm">2234</a>, <a href="3128.htm">3128</a>, <a href="3142.htm">3142</a>, <a href="3652.htm">3652</a>, <a href="3720.htm">3720</a>; and what the good of truth is has been stated above in <a href="4337.htm">4337</a>, <a href="4353.htm">4353</a> - namely, truth in will and action. This truth is such that it is called good; and conscience which is a product 
of that good is termed the conscience of truth. This good which springs from truth increases in the measure that a person exercises charity which stems from a desire to do good, and so to the extent 
and degree that he loves his neighbour. </p>
<p></p>
<p><b>[2]</b>
 The reason why good and truth are mentioned so many times in the explanations given is that all things in heaven, and consequently all in the Lord's Church, 
have a connection with truth and good In general these two include everything that is part of doctrine and everything that is part of life, ideas that are true being part of doctrine and those that 
are good being part of life. Furthermore the human mind generally does not have any objects of its thought and desire which do not involve truth or good, thought in the understanding involving truth 
and desire in the will involving good. From this it is evident that truth and good possess a very wide range of meaning and that they have an unimaginable number of derivations. This is why truth and 
good are mentioned so many times. </p>

`Et aedificavit sibi domum': quod significet incrementum boni a vero in illo statu, constat a significatione `aedificare domum' quod sit instruere intelligentia et sapientia externum hominem, de 
qua n. 1488; et quia intelligentia est veri, et sapientia est boni, hic per `aedificare domum' significatur incrementum boni a vero; quod `domus' sit bonum, videatur n. 2233, 2234, 3128, 3142, 3652, 
3720 quid bonum veri, supra n. 4337, 4353 dictum est, quod nempe sit verum voluntate et actu; id verum est quod {1} bonum dicitur; et conscientia quae ex illo bono est, vocatur conscientia veri. 
 Hoc bonum quod ex vero, tantum crescit quantum homo exercet charitatem ex velle bene, ita quantum et qualiter amat proximum.  [2] Quod toties in explicationibus bonum et verum nominentur, est causa 
quia omnia quae in caelo sunt, et inde omnia quae in Ecclesia Domini, se referant ad verum et bonum; </p>
<p>haec bina includunt in genere omnia quae sunt doctrinae et quae sunt vitae, vera quae sunt doctrinae 
et bona quae sunt vitae: mens humana etiam in universali non alia objecta habet quam quae sunt veri (c)et boni, ejus intellectus quae sunt veri, et ejus voluntas quae sunt boni; inde patet quod 
verum et bonum sint latissimae significationis, et quod derivationes eorum sint numero ineffabiles inde est quod toties verum et bonum nominentur.      @1 tunc$ </p>
