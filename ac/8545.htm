<h3 align="center" class="ired">属天的奥秘 第8545节</h3>
<h4 align="center"></h4><p><strong>8545.</strong>当我阅读约翰福音第17章关于主的爱和祂的荣耀的经文时，一些木星灵与我在一起。当他们听到那里所写的事，一种圣洁占据了他们，他们声称，其中的一切都是神性。然而那时，来自我们地球、曾为不信者的一些灵人不断制造障碍，说祂生来是一个孩子，作为一个人生活，看上去和其他人一样，被钉死在十字架上，诸如此类。不过，木星灵并不理会这些东西。他们说，他们所憎恶的魔鬼就是这样的，并补充说，天上的任何事物在我们地球灵的心里找不到位置，他们心里只有他们称之为渣滓的世俗事物。他们因以下事实发现这是实情：当这些灵人听说在他们星球，居民都赤身行走时，淫秽立刻占据他们的思维；他们对其天上的生命毫不关心，尽管当时他们也听到了（参看<a href="8375.htm">8375</a>节）。</p>

There were spirits from the earth Jupiter with me while I was reading the seventeenth chapter of John, about the Lord's love, and about His glorification; and when they heard what is there written, a 
holy influence took possession of them, and they confessed that all things therein are Divine. But then spirits from our earth who were unbelievers continually suggested objections, saying that He was 
born an infant, lived a man, appeared like other men, was crucified, and the like. But the spirits of the earth Jupiter paid no attention to these things. They said that such are their devils, whom 
they abhor, adding that nothing heavenly finds room in the minds of those spirits of our earth, but only what is earthly, which they call dross. That such is the case, they found out with certainty from 
the fact that when those spirits heard that on their earth the inhabitants walk naked, obscenity at once took possession of their thoughts, and they paid no attention to their heavenly life, of which 
they heard at the same time (see n. 8375). </p>

There were spirits from the planet Jupiter present with me while I was reading Chapter <a href="17.htm">17</a> of John, about the Lord's love and His glorification. When they heard the things written there, holiness took 
possession of them and they declared that everything there was Divine. Yet at that time spirits belonging to our planet who were unbelievers were constantly raising stumbling-blocks, saying that He had 
been born a child, lived as a person, looked like any person, was crucified, and so on. But the spirits belonging to the planet Jupiter paid no attention to any of this. They said that their devils 
whom they abhor are such, adding that nothing heavenly whatever is fixed in their minds, only what is earthly, which they called slag. They had discovered this to be so from the fact that when the spirits 
from our planet heard that there were people on theirs who went naked lewdness instantly took possession of their thoughts, and they gave no consideration whatever to their heavenly life, about 
which they also heard then, <a href="8375.htm">8375</a>. </p>

{1}Erant apud me spiritus e tellure Jovis cum legerem xvii cap. apud Johannem, de (t)Domini amore et de Ipsius glorificatione; cumque audiverunt illa quae ibi, sanctum illos occupabat, et confessi quod 
omnia Divina ibi {2}essent, at tunc spiritus nostrae telluris qui infideles fuerunt jugiter {3}suggerebant scandala, dicendo quod natus infans, vixerit homo, apparuerit sicut alius homo, quod crucifixus, 
et similia; sed spiritus telluris Jovis ad illa nihil attendebant; dicebant quod tales sint (c)illorum diaboli, quos abhorrent, addentes quod prorsus nihil caeleste insideat mentibus illorum, 
sed modo terrenum, quod vocabant scorias; et quod {4}ita sit, quod comperti fuerint ex eo quod, cum audirent quod in tellure sua ambularent nudi, (x) ilico tunc obscenum occuparet cogitationes illorum, 
et quod prorsus nihil cogitarent de caelesti (c)illorum vita, de qua etiam {5}tunc audiverunt, n. 8375. 	@1 Fuerunt$ 	@2 sint$ 	@3 suggesserunt$ 	@4 etiam comperti sint$ 	@5 simul$ </p>
