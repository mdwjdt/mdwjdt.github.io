<h4 align="center"></h4><p>1286．“口音（嘴唇）”表教义。这从以下圣言经文清楚可知，以赛亚书：<br />撒拉弗呼喊说，圣哉！圣哉！圣哉！万军之耶和华。先知说，我有祸啦！我灭亡了！因为我是嘴唇不洁的人，又住在嘴唇不洁的民中，又因我眼见大君王万军之耶和华。有一撒拉弗飞到我跟前，将炭沾我的口说，看哪，这炭沾了你的嘴唇，你的罪孽便除掉，你的罪恶就赦免了。（以赛亚书<a href="http://39-27.cn/赛6.3.htm">6:3</a>，<a href="http://39-27.cn/赛6.5.htm">5</a>-<a href="http://39-27.cn/赛6.7.htm">7</a>）<br />“嘴唇（口音）”表人的内在事物，因而表内在敬拜，崇拜就源于此，这就是此处先知的经历所代表的。谁都能看出，“沾了他的嘴唇，他的罪孽便除掉，他的罪恶就赦免了”象征“嘴唇”所表示的内在事物，就是仁爱及其教义之物。<br />同一先知书：<br />耶和华以口中的杖击打地，以嘴里的气杀戮恶人。（以赛亚书<a href="http://39-27.cn/赛11.4.htm">11:4</a>）<br />这句经文的内义不是说耶和华以口中的杖击打地，以嘴里的气杀戮恶人，而是说恶人如此对待自己。“嘴里的气”是指教义，恶人的教义是指虚假。<br />我造就嘴唇的果子-平安，愿平安归与远处的人，也归与近处的人，并且我要医治他。（以赛亚书<a href="http://39-27.cn/赛57.19.htm">57:19</a>）<br />“嘴唇的果子”表教义。<br />以西结书：<br />人子啊，你往以色列家那里去，将我的话对他们讲说。你奉差遣不是往那说话难明、言语难懂的民那里去，乃是往以色列家去，不是往那说话难明、言语难懂的多民去，他们的话是你听不懂的。我若差你往他们那里去，他们必听从你。以色列家却不肯听从你，因为他们不肯听从我；原来以色列全家是额坚心硬的人。（以西结书<a href="http://39-27.cn/结3.4.htm">3:4</a>-<a href="http://39-27.cn/结3.7.htm">7</a>）<br />“说话难明”说的是外邦人，他们尽管受制于教义的虚假，但仍拥有仁爱，因此被说成是“听从”，而那些没有仁爱的人则被说成是“额坚心硬”。<br />西番雅书：<br />我必使人民用清洁的嘴唇，好求告耶和华的名，同心合意地侍奉我。（西番雅书<a href="http://39-27.cn/番3.9.htm">3:9</a>）<br />“清洁的嘴唇”表教义。玛拉基书：<br />真实的律法在祂口中，祂嘴里没有乖僻的话。祭司的嘴里当存知识，他们也当由他口中寻求律法，因为他是万军之耶和华的使者。（玛拉基书<a href="http://39-27.cn/玛2.6.htm">2:6</a>，<a href="http://39-27.cn/玛2.7.htm">7</a>）<br />这论及代表主的利未。“口”表源于仁爱的教义。诗篇：<br />他们曾说，我们必能以舌头得胜，我们的嘴唇是我们自己的。（诗篇<a href="http://39-27.cn/诗12.4.htm">12:4</a>）<br />“嘴唇”表虚假。<br /><br />我的灵魂必饱足骨髓肥油，我要用欢乐的嘴唇赞美你。（诗篇<a href="http://39-27.cn/诗63.5.htm">63:5</a>）<br />以赛亚书：<br />当那日，埃及地必有五城的人说迦南的方言，又指着万军之耶和华起誓。（以赛亚书<a href="http://39-27.cn/赛19.18.htm">19:18</a>）<br />“方言”（ Lip）表教义。</p>

Cooper(2008,2013)</b></p>
<p><strong>[NCE]1286.</strong> The fact that a language, [a lip, or speech] is doctrine can be seen from the following passages in the Word. In Isaiah:<br />The seraphs shouted, "Holy, holy, holy is Jehovah Sabaoth!" The prophet said, "Alas for me! I have been cut off — since I am a man unclean of lips and am living in the middle of a people unclean of lips — because my eyes have seen the king, Jehovah Sabaoth." And one of the seraphs flew to me, touched my mouth, and said, "Look, now, this one has touched you on your lips, and your wickedness is subsiding, and your sin is being atoned for." (<a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_1286/bible_king-james-version_isaiah_6_3" target=_top>Isaiah 6:3</a>, <a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_1286/bible_king-james-version_isaiah_6_5-6" target=_top>5-6</a>, <a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_1286/bible_king-james-version_isaiah_6_7" target=_top>7</a>)<br />The lips stand for our inner capacities and so for inward worship, which gives rise to reverence, a fact represented here in the prophet. As anyone can see, the touching of his lips, and the consequent subsiding of his wickedness and atonement for his sin, was a representation of deeper attributes. These attributes — which are facets of charity and of the doctrine of charity — are symbolized by the lips.<br />[2] In the same author:<br />Jehovah will strike the earth with the rod of his mouth, and with the spirit{*1} of his lips he will kill the ungodly person. (<a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_1286/bible_king-james-version_isaiah_11_4" target=_top>Isaiah 11:4</a>)<br />The inner sense contains the idea not that Jehovah will strike anyone with the rod of his mouth or kill an ungodly person with the spirit of his lips but that the ungodly do this to themselves. The spirit of the lips is doctrine, and with ungodly people the doctrine is false. In the same author:<br /> [I am] the one who creates the produce of the lips:{*2} peace; peace to one who is far off and to one who is near. And I heal that person. (<a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_1286/bible_king-james-version_isaiah_57_19" target=_top>Isaiah 57:19</a>)<br />The produce of the lips stands for doctrine.<br />[3] In Ezekiel:<br />Child of humankind, come; go to the house of Israel, and you are to speak my words to them. Not to a people deep of speech and heavy of tongue are you sent [but] to the house of Israel; not to numerous peoples deep of speech and heavy of tongue, whose words you would not hear. If I sent you to these, would they not listen to you? And the house of Israel does not want to listen to you, because they do not want to listen to me. For the whole house of Israel has an obstinate forehead, and they are hard of heart. (<a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_1286/bible_king-james-version_ezekiel_3_4" target=_top>Ezekiel 3:4</a>, <a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_1286/bible_king-james-version_ezekiel_3_5" target=_top>5</a>, <a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_1286/bible_king-james-version_ezekiel_3_6" target=_top>6</a>, <a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_1286/bible_king-james-version_ezekiel_3_7" target=_top>7</a>)<br />The people deep of speech stand for the surrounding nations, which had charity, even though their doctrine was wrong. As a result, they are described as listening. Those who have no charity, though, are said to have an obstinate forehead and hard heart.<br />[4] In Zephaniah:<br />I will turn toward a people of transparent speech, so that they may all call on the name of Jehovah, to serve him with a single shoulder. (<a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_1286/bible_king-james-version_zephaniah_3_9" target=_top>Zephaniah 3:9</a>)<br />The transparent speech plainly stands for doctrine. In Malachi:<br />The law of truth was in his mouth, and perversion was not found on his lips. For the priest's lips will protect knowledge, and people will seek the law from his mouth, since he is the angel of Jehovah Sabaoth. (<a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_1286/bible_king-james-version_malachi_2_6-7" target=_top>Malachi 2:6-7</a>)<br />This describes Levi, who represents the Lord. The lips stand for doctrine based on charity. In David:<br />... who say, "By our tongue we will prevail; our lips will stand by us." (<a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_1286/bible_king-james-version_psalms_12_4" target=_top>Psalms 12:4</a>)<br />The lips stand for falsity. In the same author:<br />My soul will be filled, as with grease and fat,{*3} and my mouth will give praise with lips of song. (<a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_1286/bible_king-james-version_psalms_63_5" target=_top>Psalms 63:5</a>)<br />In Isaiah:<br />On that day there will be five cities in the land of Egypt speaking the language of Canaan and swearing to Jehovah Sabaoth. (<a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_1286/bible_king-james-version_isaiah_19_18" target=_top>Isaiah 19:18</a>)<br />A language stands for doctrine.<br /><br /><strong>Footnotes:</strong><br />{*1} The Latin word for "spirit" here (spiritus) has to do with breath, as does the Hebrew word (רוּחַ [rûaḥ]) in this passage. [LHC]<br />{*2} The "produce of the lips" is figurative for thanksgiving; see Brown, Driver, and Briggs 1996, page 973 right column, under שָׂפָה (śāṕā), Strong's 8193, definition 1a. [LHC]<br />{*3} In biblical times grease and fat were highly valued and had positive connotations.

<p align="center"><b>Potts(1905-1910) 1286</b></p><p><b>1286.</b>
That a "lip" signifies doctrine, is evident from the following passages in the Word. In Isaiah: </p>
<p>     The seraphim cried and said, Holy, holy, holy, Jehovah of Armies. And the prophet said, Woe is me! 
for I am cut off, because I am a man of unclean lips, and I dwell in the midst of a people of unclean lips; for mine eyes have seen the King, Jehovah of Armies. Then flew one of the seraphim unto me, 
and he touched my mouth, and said, Lo, this hath touched thy lips; and thine iniquity is taken away, and thy sin is expiated (Isa. 6:3, 5-7). "Lips" here denote the interior things of man, thus internal 
worship, from which is adoration, as is here represented with the prophet. That his lips were touched, and that thus his iniquity was taken away and his sin expiated, anyone may see was a representative 
of interior things that are signified by the "lips," which are things of charity and its doctrine.  [2] Again: </p>
<p>     Jehovah shall smite the earth with the rod of His mouth, and with the breath 
of His lips shall He slay the wicked (Isa. 11:4). In the internal sense this does not mean that Jehovah smites with the rod of His mouth, and slays the wicked with the breath of His lips, but that 
a wicked man does this to himself; "the breath of the lips" is doctrine, which with the wicked is false. Again: </p>
<p>I create the increase of the lips, peace, peace, to him that is far off, and to him that 
is near, saith Jehovah; and I heal him (Isa. 57:19). "The increase of the lips" denotes doctrine.  [3] In Ezekiel: </p>
<p>     Son of man, go, get thee unto the house of Israel, and speak My words unto 
them. For thou art not sent to a people deep of lip, and heavy of tongue, but to the house of Israel; not to many peoples deep of lip and heavy of tongue, whose words thou canst not understand. If I 
had sent thee to them, would they not have hearkened unto thee? But the house of Israel will not hearken unto thee, for they will not hearken unto Me, for all the house of Israel are of a hardened forehead, 
and hard of heart (Ezek. 3:4-7). "Deep of lip" is predicated of the nations which although in falsity of doctrine were yet in charity, and are therefore said to "hearken;" but they who are not 
in charity are said to be of "a hardened forehead, and a hard heart."  [4] In Zephaniah: </p>
<p>Then will I turn to the people with a clear lip, that they may all call upon the name of Jehovah, to serve 
Him with one shoulder (Zeph. 3:9). "A clear lip" manifestly denotes doctrine. In Malachi: </p>
<p>The law of truth was in his mouth, and perversity was not found in his lips. For the priest's lips should keep 
knowledge, and they should seek the law at his mouth; for he is the angel of Jehovah of Armies (Mal. 2:6-7). This is said of Levi, by whom the Lord is represented; "lips" denote doctrine from charity. 
In David: </p>
<p>     Who say, With our tongue will we prevail; our lips are with us (Ps. 12:4). Here "lips" denote falsities. Again: </p>
<p>     My soul shall be satisfied as with marrow and fatness; and my 
mouth shall praise Thee with lips of songs (Ps. 63:5). In Isaiah: </p>
<p>     In that day there shall be five cities in the land of Egypt speaking with the lip of Canaan, and swearing to Jehovah of Armies 
(Isa. 19:18) "lip" denotes doctrine. </p>

<p align="center"><b>Elliott(1983-1999) 1286</b></p><p><b>1286.</b>
That 'lip' means doctrine is clear from the following places in the Word: In Isaiah, </p>
<blockquote>
The seraphim kept calling out, Holy, Holy, Holy is Jehovah Zebaoth. The prophet said, Woe is me! I am cut off; 
for<A name="fntext1"></a><A href="#fn1"><sup>a</sup></a> I am a man with unclean lips, and am dwelling in the midst of a people with unclean lips, for my eyes have seen the King, Jehovah Zebaoth. Then flew one of the seraphim to me He touched my mouth 
and said, Behold, this has touched upon your lips, and your iniquity goes away, and your sin is atoned for. <a href="http://bible.gospelcom.net/cgi-bin/bible?passage=Isa%206:3,%205-7&amp;version=ESV&amp;interface=print&amp;showfn=yes&amp;showxref">Isa 6:3, 5-7</a>. 
</blockquote>
<p>'Lips' stands for man's interior things, and so for internal worship from 
which adoration springs. This is what the prophet's experience represented. Anyone may see that his lips being touched in this way, his iniquity going away, and his sin being atoned for, was a representation 
of interior things meant by 'the lips', which are those of charity and its doctrine. </p>
<p></p>
<p><b>[2]</b>
 In the same prophet, </p>
<blockquote>
Jehovah will smite the earth with the rod of His mouth, and with the breath<A name="fntext2"></a><A href="#fn2"><sup>b</sup></a> 
of His lips will He slay the wicked. <a href="http://bible.gospelcom.net/cgi-bin/bible?passage=Isa%2011:4&amp;version=ESV&amp;interface=print&amp;showfn=yes&amp;showxref">Isa 11:4</a>. 
</blockquote>
<p>The internal sense of this does not mean that Jehovah smites with the rod of His mouth and slays the wicked with the breath<A name="fntext2"></a><A href="#fn2"><sup>b</sup></a> of His lips, but that 
the wicked does so to himself. 'The breath of His lips' is doctrine, which with a wicked person is false. In the same prophet, </p>
<blockquote>
I create the fruit of the lips - peace, peace to the far and to the near, 
and I will heal him. <a href="http://bible.gospelcom.net/cgi-bin/bible?passage=Isa%2057:19&amp;version=ESV&amp;interface=print&amp;showfn=yes&amp;showxref">Isa 57:19</a>. 
</blockquote>
<p>'Fruit of the lips' stands for doctrine.  </p>
<p></p>
<p><b>[3]</b>
 In Ezekiel, </p>
<blockquote>
Son of man, go, get you to the house of Israel and speak My words to them. You have not been sent 
to people of foreign speech and a hard language<A name="fntext3"></a><A href="#fn3"><sup>c</sup></a> but to the house of Israel, not to many peoples of foreign speech and a hard language<A name="fntext3"></a><A href="#fn3"><sup>c</sup></a> whose words you do not hear. Surely if I sent you to such 
they would listen to you? And the house of Israel are not willing to listen to you because they are not willing to listen to Me; for the whole house of Israel are hardened in the forehead and hard in 
heart. <a href="http://bible.gospelcom.net/cgi-bin/bible?passage=Ezek%203:4-7&amp;version=ESV&amp;interface=print&amp;showfn=yes&amp;showxref">Ezek 3:4-7</a>. 
</blockquote>
<p>'Foreign speech'<A name="fntext4"></a><A href="#fn4"><sup>d</sup></a> refers to gentiles who, though subject to falsity taught by doctrine, nevertheless possess charity. These people are spoken of therefore as 'listening', whereas 
those who do not possess charity are called 'hardened in the forehead and hard in heart'. </p>
<p></p>
<p><b>[4]</b>
 In Zephaniah, </p>
<blockquote>
I will turn to the people with a clear lip that all of them may call on the name 
of Jehovah to serve Him with one shoulder. <a href="http://bible.gospelcom.net/cgi-bin/bible?passage=Zeph%203:9&amp;version=ESV&amp;interface=print&amp;showfn=yes&amp;showxref">Zeph 3:9</a>. 
</blockquote>
<p>'Clear lip' plainly stands for doctrine. In Malachi, </p>
<blockquote>
The law of truth was in His mouth, and perversity was not found on His lips. For the lips 
of the priest yell keep knowledge, and they will seek the law from his mouth, for he is the angel<A name="fntext5"></a><A href="#fn5"><sup>e</sup></a> of Jehovah Zebaoth. <a href="http://bible.gospelcom.net/cgi-bin/bible?passage=Mal%202:6,%207&amp;version=ESV&amp;interface=print&amp;showfn=yes&amp;showxref">Mal 2:6, 7</a>. 
</blockquote>
<p>This refers to Levi who represents the Lord. 'Lips' stands 
for doctrine deriving from charity.  </p>
<blockquote>
In David, Those who say With our tongue we will prevail, our lips are with us. <a href="http://bible.gospelcom.net/cgi-bin/bible?passage=Ps%2012:4&amp;version=ESV&amp;interface=print&amp;showfn=yes&amp;showxref">Ps 12:4</a>.

Quod 'labium' sit doctrina, constat ab his locis in Verbo: apud Esaiam, 	Seraphim clamabant, Sanctus, Sanctus, Sanctus, Jehovah Zebaoth;... dixit propheta, Vae mihi, excisus sum, qui vir immundus labiis
