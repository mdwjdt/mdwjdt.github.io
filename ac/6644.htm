Verses 6, 7. And Joseph died, and all his brethren, and all that generation. And the sons of Israel were fruitful, and were productive, and multiplied, and became very exceeding numerous; and the land 
was filled with them. "And Joseph died," signifies that the case would now be different with the internal of the church; "and all his brethren, and all that generation," signifies also with the external 
in particular and in general; "and the sons of Israel were fruitful, and were productive," signifies that the truths of the church increased as to good; "and multiplied, and became very exceeding 
numerous," signifies that they increased very much as to truths from good; "and the land was filled with them," signifies even to fullness of the church. </p>

Verses 6, 7 And Joseph died, and all his brothers, and all that generation. And the children of Israel were fruitful and productive, and multiplied and became very very numerous; and the land was filled 
with them.  </p>
<p>'And Joseph died' means that the situation with the internal part of the Church had now altered.' And all his brothers, and all that generation' means also with the external part of 
it in particular and in general. 'And the children of Israel were fruitful and productive' means that the Church's truths increased in goodness. 'And multiplied and became very very numerous' means that 
they increased enormously in truths from good. 'And the land was filled with them' means even to the point at which the Church became complete. </p>

Vers. 6, 7. Et mortuus est Joseph, et omnes fratres ejus, et omnis generatio illa.  Et filii Israelis fructificabantur et producebantur, et multiplicabantur et numerosi facti {1} in valde valde, et impleta 
terra illis.  `Et mortuus est Joseph' significat quod cum interno Ecclesiae nunc se aliter haberet: `et omnes fratres ejus, et omnis generatio illa' significat etiam cum externo in particulari 
et in communi: `et filii Israelis fructificabantur et producebantur' significat quod vera Ecclesiae crescerent quoad bonum: `et multiplicabantur et numerosi facti in valde valde' significat quod plurimum 
crescerent quoad vera a bono: `et impleta terra illis' significat usque ad plenum Ecclesiae. 	@1 i sunt I$ </p>
