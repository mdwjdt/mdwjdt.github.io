<h3 align="center" class="ired">属天的奥秘 第2198节</h3>
<h4 align="center"></h4><p><strong>2198.</strong>“亚伯拉罕和撒拉已经老迈”表主所具有的人性要被脱去。这从“亚伯拉罕和撒拉”的代表和“老迈”或“上了年纪”的含义清楚可知。亚伯拉罕在此代表主的理性良善，撒拉代表主的理性真理，如本章各处所述。故他们在此各自代表主所具有的人性，原因如前所述，耶和华现在场与亚伯拉罕说话。并且，耶和华就是主的神性本身，并未与祂分离，即便它在历史事件中表现为分离；因为它只能以这种方式通过历史事件被代表。不过，经上说“亚伯拉罕和撒拉已经老迈”，意思是那人性要被脱去，“老迈（或年迈）”无非暗示最后的时日。在圣言中，“老迈（或年迈）”和那人“死了”的事实在各处有所提及。但就内义而言，诸如属乎肉体的老迈或死亡从来不被觉知，仅被感知为某种从整个思维顺序明显可知的其它事物。因为在来世，老迈或死亡不为人知。如前所述，从整个思路明显可知此处所表示的是什么，即主要脱去人性。</p>

Abraham and Sarah were old. That this signifies the Human with the Lord, that it should be put off, is evident from the representation of Abraham and of Sarah; as also from the signification of the "old," 
or of "old age." Abraham here represents the Lord as to rational good, and Sarah represents the Lord as to rational truth, as has been said repeatedly in this chapter; thus each here represents 
the Human with the Lord, for the reason, as before said, that Jehovah was now present and spoke with Abraham; and Jehovah was the Lord's Divine itself, not separate from Him, although it is presented 
as separate in the historical representatives, for by means of historical things it cannot be represented otherwise. But as regards its being said that "Abraham and Sarah were old," signifying that that 
human should be put off-"old age" involves nothing else than the last time. "Old age" is mentioned in various places in the Word, as also that men "died;" but in the internal sense no old age, or death, 
such as those of the body, are ever perceived; but something else that is evident from the series of things; for in the other life old age and death are unknown. What is here meant is evident, as 
before said, from the series of things, namely, that the Lord was to put off the human. </p>

<p align="center"><b>Elliott(1983-1999) 2198</b></p><p><b>2198.</b>
'Abraham and Sarah were old' means that the human with the Lord was to be cast off. This is clear from the representation of 'Abraham and Sarah', and also from the meaning of 'old' or old age. 'Abraham' 
here represents the Lord as regards rational good, while 'Sarah' represents the Lord as regards rational truth, as stated above in various places in this chapter. Thus each here represents the human 
with the Lord, the reason being, as stated above, that Jehovah was now present and spoke to Abraham. And Jehovah was the Lord's Divine itself, not separate from Him even though it presents itself in 
representative historical events as separate; for by means of historical events it cannot be represented in any other way. But when it is said that Abraham and Sarah were old the meaning is that that 
human was to be cast off. 'Old age' does not imply anything other than a final period. In the Word reference is made in various places to 'old aye' and to the fact that people 'died'. But neither old 
age nor death of the body is ever perceived in the internal sense, but something other than these which is evident from the whole sequence of thought; for those in the next life do not know what old 
age is or what death is. What is meant here is evident, as has been said, from the whole train of thought, which is that the Lord was to cast off the human. </p>

</p><b>2198.</b>
`Abraham et Sarah senes': quod significet humanum apud Dominum quod exueretur, constat ex repraesentatione `Abrahami et Sarae,' tum a significatione `senum seu senectutis'; `Abraham' hic repraesentat 
Dominum quoad bonum rationale, et `Sarah' repraesentat Dominum quoad verum rationale, ut passim supra in hoc capite dictum; ita uterque repraesentat hic humanum apud Dominum, ex causa, ut dictum supra, 
quod nunc Jehovah adesset et locutus cum Abrahamo, et Jehovah erat ipsum Divinum Domini, et non separatum ab Ipso, tametsi ut separatum in repraesentativis historicis sistitur; per historica (t)non 
repraesentari aliter potest.  Quod autem dicatur quod `Abraham et Sarah senes essent' significat quod humanum illud exueretur; senectus non aliud involvit quam ultimum tempus; in Verbo passim memoratur 
senectus, tum etiam quod mortui sint, sed in sensu interno nusquam aliqua senectus nec mors qualis est corporis, percipitur, sed aliud quod ex serie rerum constat, nam quid senium et quid mors, ignorant 
in altera vita; quid hic, constat, ut dictum, ex serie, nempe quod Dominus exueret humanum. </p>
