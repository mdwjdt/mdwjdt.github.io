<h3 align="center" class="ired">属天的奥秘 第7932节</h3>
<h4 align="center"></h4><p><strong>7932.</strong>“将来你们到了耶和华所赐给你们的那地”表当他们到了主所赐给他们的天堂时。这从“地”的含义清楚可知，“地”，此处即他们所要到的迦南地，是指主的国度，因而是指天堂（参看<a href="1607.htm">1607</a>，<a href="1866.htm">1866</a>，<a href="3038.htm">3038</a>，<a href="3481.htm">3481</a>，<a href="3705.htm">3705</a>，<a href="4116.htm">4116</a>，<a href="4240.htm">4240</a>，<a href="4447.htm">4447</a>，<a href="5757.htm">5757</a>节）。以色列人代表那些属于属灵教会，在世上生活在主降临之前的人，他们若不通过主就无法得救，因此被保护并滞留在低地；在此期间，他们在那里受到四围地狱的侵扰。所以，当主降世，把祂的人身在自己里面变成神性，然后等到祂复活时，便释放了那些被保护和滞留的人，并在他们经历试探后，把他们提入天堂。这些就是第二卷摩西书，即出埃及记的内义所包含的事。“埃及人”表示那些进行侵扰的人；被引离他们表示释放；在旷野四十年的生活表示试探；被领进迦南地表示被提入天堂。关于这些含义，前面都提到了（参看<a href="6854.htm">6854</a>，<a href="6914.htm">6914</a>，<a href="7091.htm">7091</a>e，<a href="7828.htm">7828</a>节）。由此明显可知，“将来你们到了那地”表示当他们到了主所赐给他们的天堂时。</p>

Verses 25-28. And it shall be that when ye shall come unto the land which Jehovah will give you, as He hath spoken, that ye shall keep this service. And it shall be, when your sons shall say unto you, 
What is this service to you? that ye shall say, This is the sacrifice of the passover to Jehovah, in that He passed over the houses of the sons of Israel in Egypt, when He inflicted a plague on Egypt, 
and liberated our houses. And the people bent itself, and bowed itself. And the sons of Israel went and they did as Jehovah commanded Moses and Aaron, so did they. "And it shall be that when ye shall 
come unto the land which Jehovah will give you," signifies to heaven which they shall have from the Lord; "as He hath spoken," signifies according to the promise in the Word; "that ye shall keep this 
service," signifies worship on account of liberation; "and it shall be, when your sons shall say unto you," signifies the interior perception of truth, which perception is of conscience; "What is this 
service to you?" signifies when they are in worship; "that ye shall say," signifies thought; "This is the sacrifice of the passover to Jehovah," signifies the worship of the Lord on account of liberation; 
"in that He passed over the houses of the sons of Israel," signifies that damnation fled away from the goods in which they were held by the Lord; "in Egypt," signifies when in the vicinity of 
the evil; "when He inflicted a plague on Egypt," signifies when they of the church were damned who had been in faith separate from charity; "and liberated our houses," signifies that still nothing damnable 
came to them, because they were in good from the Lord; "and the people bent itself, and bowed itself," signifies humiliation of the mouth and of the heart; "and the sons of Israel went and they 
did as Jehovah commanded Moses and Aaron," signifies that they who were of the spiritual church obeyed truth Divine; "so did they," signifies performance from the will. </p>
<p>[7932a.] And it shall be that 
when ye shall come unto the land which Jehovah will give you. That this signifies to heaven which they shall have from the Lord, is evident from the signification of "the land," here the land of Canaan 
to which they were to come, as being the Lord's kingdom, thus heaven (see n. 1607, 1866, 3038, 3481, 3705, 4116, 4240, 4447, 5757). For the sons of Israel represented those who were of the spiritual 
church and were in the world before the Lord's coming, and could not be saved except by the Lord, and therefore had been preserved and detained in the lower earth, where meanwhile they had been infested 
by the hells which were round about. When therefore the Lord came into the world, and made the Human in Himself Divine, then when He rose again, He liberated those who had been preserved and detained, 
and after they had undergone temptations He raised them into heaven. These are the things which are contained in the internal sense in the second book of Moses, which is Exodus; by the Egyptians 
are signified those who had infested; by the bringing forth thence is signified liberation; by the life of forty years in the wilderness are signified temptations; and by the introduction into the 
land of Canaan is signified being raised into heaven (see what has been said above, n. 6854, 6914, 7091, 7828). For all this it is evident that by "when ye shall come unto the land" is signified to heaven 
which they shall have from the Lord. </p>

'And it shall be, when you come to the land which Jehovah will give you' means when they reach heaven, given them by the Lord. This is clear from the meaning of 'the land', at this point the land of 
Canaan, which they will 'come to' as the Lord's kingdom, which is heaven, dealt with in <a href="1607.htm">1607</a>, <a href="1866.htm">1866</a>, <a href="3078.htm">3078</a>, <a href="3481.htm">3481</a>, <a href="3705.htm">3705</a>, <a href="4116.htm">4116</a>, <a href="4240.htm">4240</a>, <a href="4447.htm">4447</a>, <a href="5757.htm">5757</a>. The Children of Israel represented those belonging to the 
spiritual Church who lived in the world before the Lord's Coming, but could not be saved except by the Lord, on account of which they were preserved and held back on the lower earth, where they were in 
the meantime molested by the hells which were round about them. When therefore the Lord came into the world and made the Human within Him Divine, He then - when He rose again - delivered those who had 
been preserved and held back there. And after they had undergone temptations He raised them to heaven. These matters are what the internal sense of the second Book of Moses or Exodus contains. By 'the 
Egyptians' those who molested are meant; by 'being led away from them' deliverance is meant; by 'living forty years in the wilderness' temptations are meant; and by 'being led into the land of Canaan' 
being raised into heaven is meant. For what has been mentioned already about these meanings, see <a href="6854.htm">6854</a>, <a href="6914.htm">6914</a>, <a href="7091.htm">7091</a> (end), <a href="7828.htm">7828</a>. From all this it is evident that 'when you come into the land' means 
when they reach heaven, given them by the Lord. </p>

1}.  `Et erit quod veneritis ad terram quam dabit Jehovah vobis': quod significet ad caelum, quod a Domino illis, constat a significatione `terrae,' hic `terrae Canaanis,' ad quam venturi, quod sit regnum 
Domini, ita caelum, de qua n. 1607, 1866, 3038, 3481, 3705, 4116, 4240, 4447, 5757; filii enim Israelis repraesentabant illos qui ab Ecclesia spirituali, {2}et in mundo ante Adventum Domini fuerunt, 
(c)ac non salvari potuerunt nisi per Dominum, (c)et ideo conservati fuerunt ac detenti in terra inferiore ubi interea infestati sunt ab infernis quae circumcirca; cum itaque Dominus in mundum venit 
ac Humanum in Se Divinum fecit, tunc, cum resurrexit, illos qui ibi conservati et detenti fuerunt, liberavit, ac eos, postquam tentationes subierunt, in caelum elevavit; haec sunt quae in sensu {3}interno 
continentur in Libro 2 Moschis seu Exodo; per (x)`Aegyptios' significantur illi qui infestarunt; per eductionem inde significatur liberatio; per vitam quadraginta annorum in deserto tentationes 
et per introductionem in terram Canaanem elevatio in caelum, videantur quae de his prius n. 6854, 6914, 7091 fin., 7828, memorata sunt.  Ex his patet quod per `cum veneritis in terram' significetur ad 
caelum quod a Domino illis. 	@1 Not numbered in I$ 	@2 qui$ 	@3 interiore$ </p>
