<h3 align="center" class="ired">属天的奥秘 第2353节</h3>
<h4 align="center"></h4><p><strong>2353.</strong>“今夜”表当这两人不再得到承认时的末期。这从“夜”的含义清楚可知，“夜”是指黑暗时期，这时不再看见光之物。那两个天使不是夜里来的，而是晚上来的，但由于说话和呼叫的是所多玛人，也就是那些处于恶与假之人，故经上说“今夜”而非“今晚”。因为在圣言中，“夜”表不再有任何真理之光，只有假与恶，因而表审判到来之时的末期。<br />这种含义在其它地方也经常碰到。如弥迦书：<br />论到使我百姓走入歧途的先知：你们必遭遇黑夜，全无异象；又必遭遇幽暗，以致不能占卜。日头必向先知沉落，白昼向他们变为黑暗。（弥迦书<a href="http://39-27.cn/弥3.5.htm">3:5</a>-<a href="http://39-27.cn/弥3.6.htm">6</a>）<br />“先知”在此表那些教导虚假的人；“黑夜”、“幽暗”、“日头沉落”和“白昼变为黑暗”表虚假和邪恶。<br />约翰福音：<br />人在白日走路，就不至跌倒；若在黑夜走路，就必跌倒，因为他没有光。（约翰福音<a href="http://39-27.cn/约11.9.htm">11:9</a>-<a href="http://39-27.cn/约11.10.htm">10</a>）<br />此处“黑夜”表源于邪恶的虚假；“光”表源于良善的真理；因为正如一切真理之光皆来自良善，故一切虚假之光皆来自邪恶。<br /><br />趁着白日，我必须做那差我来者的工；黑夜将到，就没有人能做工了。（约翰福音<a href="http://39-27.cn/约9.4.htm">9:4</a>）<br />“白日”表良善与真理存在之时的时期和状态；但“黑夜”是指邪恶与虚假存在之时的时期和状态。<br />路加福音：<br />我对你们说，当那一夜，两个人在一个床上，要取去一个，撇下一个。（路加福音<a href="http://39-27.cn/路17.34.htm">17:34</a>）<br />此处“夜”表末期，这时不再有任何信之真。当以色列人出埃及时，他们被命令“半夜出去”（出埃及记<a href="http://39-27.cn/出11.4.htm">11:4</a>），是因为以这种方式代表教会中的善与真的消磨，以及除了假与恶外，没有一物留在埃及。他们照做后，埃及一切头生的都被杀了（出埃及记<a href="http://39-27.cn/出12.12.htm">12:12</a>，<a href="http://39-27.cn/出12.29.htm">29</a>，<a href="http://39-27.cn/出12.30.htm">30</a>）。并且由于那些具有良善与真理的人象所多玛的罗得那样在恶与假当中时得到保护，故对他们来说，那“夜”被称为“耶和华的看守夜”（出埃及记<a href="http://39-27.cn/出12.42.htm">12:42</a>）。</p>

This night. That this signifies the last time, when these are no longer acknowledged, is evident from the signification of "night," as being a time of darkness, when the things of light are no longer 
seen. The angels did not come in the night, but in the evening; but as it is the men of Sodom who spoke and cried out, that is, those who are in falsity and evil, it is not said in the "evening," but 
in the "night." For in the Word "night" signifies the time and state when there is no longer any light of truth, but merely falsity and evil. [2] Thus the last time when comes the Judgment; with which 
signification it is often found, as in Micah: </p>
<p>     Against the prophets that lead the people astray: It shall be night unto you that ye have no vision; and it shall be darkness to you, that ye shall 
not divine, and the sun shall go down upon the prophets, and the day shall be black over them (Micah 3:5-6). "Prophets" here denote those who teach falsities; "night," "darkness," the "going down 
of the sun," and the "blackening day," denote falsities and evils. [3] In John: </p>
<p>     If anyone walk in the day, he stumbleth not; but if anyone walk in the night he stumbleth, because the light is not 
in him (John 11:9-10); </p>
<p>where "night" denotes falsity from evil; "light," truth from good; for as all the light of truth is from good, so all the night of falsity is from evil. [4] Again: </p>
<p>     I 
must work the works of Him that sent Me while it is day; the night cometh when no one can work (John 9:4); </p>
<p>"day" denotes the time and state when there is what is good and true; but "night" when there 
is what is evil and false. [5] In Luke: </p>
<p>     I say unto you, in that night there shall be two upon one bed, the one shall be accepted, the other abandoned (Luke 17:34); </p>
<p>here "night" denotes the last 
time, when there is no longer any truth of faith. [6] Inasmuch as when the sons of Israel went out from Egypt there was represented in that country the vastation of good and truth within the church, 
and that there then reigned therein nothing but what was evil and false, it was commanded that they should go out at midnight (Exod. 11:4); and it also came to pass that at midnight all the firstborn 
of Egypt were slain (Exod. 12:12, 29, 30). And inasmuch as they who are in what is good and true, who were represented by the sons of Israel, are guarded when among falsities and evils (as was Lot 
in Sodom), that night, in respect to them, is called "a night of the guardings of Jehovah" (verse 42). </p>

<p align="center"><b>Elliott(1983-1999) 2353</b></p><p><b>2353.</b>
'In the night' means the final period when these two are acknowledged no longer. This is clear from the meaning of 'the night' as a time of darkness when the things of light are seen no longer. The angels 
did not come in the night but at evening time, but because it was the men of Sodom who spoke and cried out, that is, those who are immersed in falsity and evil, the expression used is not 'in the 
evening' but 'in the night'. For 'night' in the Word means the period of time and the state when the light of truth exists no longer, but merely falsity and evil, and so is the final period when judgement 
takes place. </p>
<p></p>
<p><b>[2]</b>
 This meaning is met in other places, as in Micah, </p>
<blockquote>
Against the prophets who lead the people astray: It is night for you instead of vision, and darkness for you instead of 
divination, and the sun is setting upon the prophets and the day is becoming black over them. <a href="http://bible.gospelcom.net/cgi-bin/bible?passage=Micah%203:-5,%206&amp;version=ESV&amp;interface=print&amp;showfn=yes&amp;showxref">Micah 3:-5, 6</a>. 
</blockquote>
<p>'The prophets' here stands for those who teach falsities. 'Night', 'darkness', 'sunset', 
and 'the day becoming black' stand for falsities and evils. </p>
<p></p>
<p><b>[3]</b>
 In John, </p>
<blockquote>
If anyone walks in the day he does not stumble; but if anyone walks in the night he stumbles because the light is not in 
him. <a href="http://bible.gospelcom.net/cgi-bin/bible?passage=John%2011:-9,%2010&amp;version=ESV&amp;interface=print&amp;showfn=yes&amp;showxref">John 11:-9, 10</a>. 
</blockquote>
<p>Here 'night' stands for falsity deriving from evil. 'The light' stands for truth deriving from good, for just as all the light of truth derives from good, so all the night of 
falsity does so from evil. </p>
<p></p>
<p><b>[4]</b>
 In the same gospel, </p>
<blockquote>
I must work the works of Him who sent Me while it is day; night is coming when nobody can work. <a href="http://bible.gospelcom.net/cgi-bin/bible?passage=John%209:-4&amp;version=ESV&amp;interface=print&amp;showfn=yes&amp;showxref">John 9:-4</a>. 
</blockquote>
<p>'Day' stands for the period of time 
and the state when good and truth are present, but 'night' when evil and falsity are present. </p>
<p></p>
<p><b>[5]</b>
 In Luke, </p>
<blockquote>
I tell you, in that night there will be two upon one bed; one will be taken, the other 
left. <a href="http://bible.gospelcom.net/cgi-bin/bible?passage=Luke%2017:-34&amp;version=ESV&amp;interface=print&amp;showfn=yes&amp;showxref">Luke 17:-34</a>. 
</blockquote>
<p>Here 'night' stands for the final period when the truth of faith is no more. </p>
<p></p>
<p><b>[6]</b>
 When the children of Israel were going out of Egypt they were commanded 'to go out at midnight', 
because in this way the vastation of good and truth inside the Church was represented, and also that nothing except falsity and evil reigned there any longer, <a href="http://bible.gospelcom.net/cgi-bin/bible?passage=Exod%2011:%204&amp;version=ESV&amp;interface=print&amp;showfn=yes&amp;showxref">Exod 11: 4</a>. And when they did, all 
the firstborn of Egypt were slain at midnight, <a href="http://bible.gospelcom.net/cgi-bin/bible?passage=Exod%2012:%2012,%2029,%2030&amp;version=ESV&amp;interface=print&amp;showfn=yes&amp;showxref">Exod 12: 12, 29, 30</a>. Now because those with whom good and truth are present, who were represented by the children of Israel, are watched over when, like 
Lot in Sodom, they are among falsities and evils, that night is described in reference to them as 'the night when Jehovah kept watch', <a href="http://bible.gospelcom.net/cgi-bin/bible?passage=Exod%2012:%2042&amp;version=ESV&amp;interface=print&amp;showfn=yes&amp;showxref">Exod 12: 42</a>. </p>

</p><b>2353.</b>
`Noctu': quod significet ultimum tempus, quando amplius non agnoscuntur, constat a significatione `noctis' quod sit tempus tenebrarum, quando non amplius conspiciuntur illa quae lucis sunt: angeli non 
venerunt noctu sed vespera, sed quia sunt viri Sodomae qui locuti et clamaverunt, hoc est, qui in falso et malo sunt, non dicitur vespere, sed `noctu'; `nox' enim in Verbo significat tempus et statum 
quando nulla amplius lux veri sed mere falsum et malum, ita ultimum, quando judicium; [2] in qua {1} significatione legitur passim {2}, ut apud Micham, 	Contra prophetas seducentes populum;... nox 
vobis ex visione, et obtenebrescit vobis ex divinatione, et occidit sol super prophetis, et nigrescit super iis dies, iii 5, 6; </p>
<p>`prophetae' hic pro iis qui docent falsa; `nox, obtenebratio, occasus 
solis, nigrescens dies' pro falsis et malis: [3] apud Johannem, 	Si quis ambulat in die, non offendit,... si quis autem ambulat in nocte, offendit, quia lux non est in illo, xi 9, 10; </p>
<p>ubi `nox' pro 
falso ex malo; {3} `lux' pro vero ex bono; sicut enim omnis lux veri est ex bono, ita omnis nox falsi est ex malo: [4] apud eundem, 	Me oportet operari opera Ipsius, Qui misit Me, quousque dies est, 
venit nox quando nemo potest operari, ix 4; </p>
<p>`dies' pro tempore et statu quando bonum et verum, `nox' autem quando malum et falsum: [5] apud Lucam, 	Dico vobis, ea nocte erunt duo super lecto uno, unus	acceptabitur, 
alter deseretur, xvii 34; </p>
<p>(o)ibi nox pro ultimo tempore quando non amplius verum fidei. [6] Quia in Aegypto cum exibant inde filii Israelis, repraesentabatur vastatio boni et veri intra 
Ecclesiam, et quod amplius nihil nisi falsum et malum regnaret, mandatum erat ut `media nocte exirent,' Exod. xi 4; et factum, quod `media nocte omnia primogenita Aegypti occisa sint,' Exod. xii 12, 
29, 30: et quia illi qui in bono et vero, repraesentati per filios Israelis, inter falsa et mala, sicut Lot Sodomae, custoditi sunt, nox illa respective ad eos `nox custodiarum Jehovae' dicitur, ibid. 
vers. 42. 	@1 simili.$ 	@2 i alibi in Verbo.$ 	@3 i et.$ </p>
