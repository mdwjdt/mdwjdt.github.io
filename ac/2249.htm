<h3 align="center" class="ired">属天的奥秘 第2249节</h3>
<h4 align="center"></h4><p><strong>2249.</strong>“亚伯拉罕近前来说”表主出于人性的思维，这思维与神性联结得越发紧密。这从前文，也就是论述主对于人类的思维之处可推知，因而无需解释。就内义而言，本章充分描述了主的思维和直觉的状态，并且开头描述了主的人性与其神性联结的状态。世人或许觉得这些事好像不那么重要，然而，它们却是至关重要的。因为这些大事连同其代表会以最美的形式活生生地呈现在天使面前，因为对天使而言，内义即圣言。此外，无数随它们而来并与其类似的其它事物也会呈现出来，这些事物都涉及主与天堂的结合，以及祂的神性在他们人性中的接受。事实上，天使的观念具有这样的特点，比起其它事物，他们最享受这类事物，并发觉它们是令人愉悦的。天使还由此在主的人性本质与其神性本质融合的事上越来越被启发和确认。因为天使也曾是人，他们还是世人时，只想到主是一个人，并且主也是神，以及圣三一，从而为自己形成各种观念。但当时，他们并不知道这些观念的性质。<br />天上的奥秘具有这样的性质：虽然它们超越一切领悟力，但每个人仍可以为自己形成有关它们的某些观念。因为若不通过以某种方式所形成的某些观念，任何事物都不能保持在记忆中，更不能进入任何思维。由于他们的观念只能通过尘世事物，或类似它们的事物形成，并且那时由无法理解的事物所产生的谬念也进来了（在来世，这些谬念会使更为内在的思想观念远离信之良善与真理），所以为了驱散这些谬念，本章在内义上大量阐述了主的人性与其神性的联结，以及祂的直觉和思维。当世人阅读圣言时，这些事物同时也会以这样的方式进入天使的直觉，即他们先前通过其它来源和由此而来的顾忌而形成的观念逐渐被驱散，新的、与天使所在之光和谐一致的观念被注入。比起属天天使，这种事会更多地发生在属灵天使身上，因为他们照其观念的洁净程度而变得更适合接受属天之物。众所周知，天堂在主眼里并不纯粹，事实上，众天使的确不断被完善。</p>

And Abraham drew near, and said. That this signifies the Lord's thought from the Human, which thought adjoined itself more closely to the Divine, follows from the things that precede, where the Lord's 
thought concerning the human race is treated of: thus without explication. That in this chapter in the internal sense the state of the Lord's thought and perception is so fully described, and at the 
beginning the state of the conjunction of the Lord's Human with His Divine, will possibly appear to man as if it were not of so much importance. [2] And yet it is of the greatest moment; for before 
the angels, to whom the internal sense is the Word, these things are presented to the life, together with their representatives, in a most beautiful form; besides numberless things that follow from them 
and bear their likeness, concerning the Lord's conjunction with heaven, and the reception of His Divine in their human; for the ideas of angels are such that they relish such things above all others, 
and perceive them as being most pleasant; and they are also enlightened and confirmed by them more and more in regard to the unition of the Lord's Human Essence with His Divine Essence; for the angels 
have been men, and when men they could not but think of the Lord as a man, and of the Lord as God, as also of the Divine Trinity, and form for themselves various ideas, although at that time they 
knew not of what quality these ideas were. [3] For heavenly arcana are of such a nature that although they surpass all apprehension, yet everyone forms for himself some idea of them; for nothing can 
possibly be retained in the memory, still less enter into anything of thought, except by means of some idea formed in one way or another. And because their ideas could not be formed otherwise than from 
things in the world, or from things analogous to those in the world; and because fallacies then insinuated themselves from things not understood (which in the other life alienate the ideas of thought-which 
are then more internal-from the truth and good of faith),[4] in order that such things may be dispersed, so much is said in this chapter, in its internal sense, about the conjunction of the Lord's 
Human with His divine, and about His perception and thought; and accordingly when the Word is read, these things are so presented to the perception of the angels that their former ideas, formed from 
other sources and from scruples easily springing therefrom, are gradually dissipated, and new ideas are insinuated that are in conformity with the light of truth in which the angels are. This takes 
place more with the spiritual angels than with the celestial; for according to the purification of their ideas are they perfected for the reception of celestial things. It is known that heaven is not 
pure before the Lord; and it is a truth that the angels are continually being perfected. </p>

<p align="center"><b>Elliott(1983-1999) 2249</b></p><p><b>2249.</b>
'Abraham drew near and said' means the Lord's thought from the Human, which thought allied itself more closely to the Divine. This follows from what has gone before where the subject is the Lord's thought 
regarding the human race, and so follows without explanation. Described at great length in this chapter in the internal sense is the state of the Lord's thought and perception, and in the opening 
part of it the state of the conjunction of the Lord's Human with His Divine. </p>

<p><b>[2]</b>
 To men it will perhaps seem as though these matters were not of such great importance, yet they are of the utmost 
importance. For these great matters, together with their representatives, are brought before the angels - for whom the internal sense constitutes the Word - in a most beautiful form. Countless other matters 
are also presented which follow from them and bear resemblance to them regarding the conjunction of the Lord with heaven and the reception of His Divine within their human. Indeed angels' ideas 
are such that they relish those matters more than anything else and perceive them as being most delightful. Thereby they are also enlightened and confirmed more and more regarding the matter of the union 
of the Lord's Human Essence with His Divine Essence. For angels were once men; and when they were men they could not do other than think of the Lord as a man, and of the Lord as God, and also of 
the Divine Trinity, and so formulate various ideas for themselves, though they did not know the nature of those ideas at the time. </p>
<p></p>
<p><b>[3]</b>
 The position with heavenly arcana is that although they lie beyond 
all apprehension, everyone nevertheless formulates for himself some idea of them, for nothing can ever be retained in the memory, still less enter any thought whatever, except through some idea, 
however this came to be formed. And since angels' ideas could not be formed except from those objects that exist in the world, or from objects analogous to those in the world; and since at that time illusions 
arising from things that were not understood entered in - illusions which in the next life alienate the then more interior ideas of thought from the truth and good of faith - therefore much is 
said in this chapter in its internal sense, to dispel such illusions, regarding the conjunction of the Lord's Human with the Divine and regarding His perception and thought. And when men read the Word 
those matters enter at the same time into the perception of angels in such a way that previous ideas that had been formed from alien sources and from scruples easily arising out of these are gradually 
dispersed, and new ideas are instilled which are in keeping with the light of truth that angels possess. This happens more among spiritual angels than celestial, for it is in the measure that ideas 
are purified that spiritual angels are made more perfect for receiving celestial things. It is well known that even heaven is not pure in the sight of the Lord,<A name="fntext1"></a><A href="#fn1"><sup>a</sup></a> for it is indeed true that angels are 
constantly being made more perfect.

`Accessit Abraham et dixit': quod significet cogitationem Domini ex Humano quae propius adjunxit se Divino, sequitur ex illi quae praecedunt, ubi agitur de cogitatione Domini de genere humana ita absque 
explicatione.  (s)Quod {1} in hoc capite in sensu interno tantum describatur status cogitationis et perceptionis Domini, et in principio tantum status conjunctionis Humani cum Divino Domini, quidem 
coram homine forte appariturum, sicut non foret tanti; sed usque maximi momenti est; [2] nam coram angelis quibus sensus internus est Verbum, sistuntur haec ad vivum cum suis repraesentativis in pulcherrima 
forma, praeter innumerabilia quae consequentia sunt et similitudinem ducentia, de conjunctione Domini cum caelo et receptione Divini Ipsius in eorum humano; ideae enim angelicae tales sunt quod 
illa prae omni alio sapiant ac ut amoenissima percipiant; inde etiam illustrantur et confirmantur magis et magis de unitione Humanae Domini Essentiae cum Divina; angeli enim sunt qui homines fuerunt, 
et cum homines, non potuerunt aliter quam cogitare de Domino ut homine, et de Domino ut Deo, tum de Trino Divino, et sibi varias ideas, tametsi non sciverunt tunc quales, formare; [3] arcana enim 
caelestia hoc secum habent, quae tametsi superant omnem captum, usque quisque de illis {2} aliquam ideam sibi facit, nam nihil usquam memoria teneri potest, minus intrare in aliquid cogitationis, nisi 
per aliquam ideam utcumque formatam; et quia ideae non potuerunt aliter quam ex illis quae in mundo sunt, vel ex analogis eorum quae in mundo, formari, et tunc ex non intellectis fallaciae se insinuarunt, 
[4] quae in altera vita cogitationis ideas tunc interiores abalienant a vero et bono fidei, ut talia discutiantur, tantum in hoc capite in sensu ejus interno agitur de conjunctione Humani cum Divino 
Domini, deque Ipsius perceptione et cogitatione, et tunc cum legitur Verbum, sistuntur illa ad perceptionem angelorum ita ut priores ideae ex alienis et inde nascentibus facile scrupulis formatae 
sensim dissipentur, et novae quae luci veritatis in qua angeli, conformes sunt, insinuentur; haec magis apud angelos spirituales quam caelestes; nam secundum purificationem idearum perficiuntur ad receptionem 
caelestium; quod caelum non sit purum coram Domino, notum est; et quod continue perficiantur, verum est.(s) 	@1 Remainder of this [ ] was very different in A and finally deleted. A new version 
was then written on a separate sheet, but I differs considerably from it (see Appendix volume).$ 	@2 aliquis de iis.$ </p>
