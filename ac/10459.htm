<h3 align="center" class="ired">属天的奥秘 第10459节</h3>
<h4 align="center"></h4><p><strong>10459</strong>.“就看见牛犊，又看见跳舞”表地狱的敬拜，这敬拜与这个民族外在的爱之快乐，以及他们的内层庆祝的渴望是一致的。这从“牛犊”和“跳舞”的含义清楚可知：“牛犊”是指这个民族外在的爱之快乐（参看<a href="10407.htm">10407</a>节）；在此之所以表示与这种快乐一致的敬拜，是因为当摩西走近营前时，这个民族在进行这种敬拜；而这种敬拜来源于地狱，这从前面的说明清楚看出来。“跳舞”是指内层庆祝的渴望，如前所述（<a href="10416.htm">10416</a>节）。</p>

That he saw the calf and the dances. That this signifies infernal worship, which was according to the delight of the external loves of that nation, and its consequent interior festivity, is evident from 
the signification of "the calf," as being the delight of the external loves of that nation (see above, n. 10407); that it here denotes worship according to this delight, is because when Moses came 
nigh unto the camp, that nation was in such worship; and that such worship is from hell, is evident from what was shown above; and from the signification of "the dances," as being interior festivity 
(of which also above, n. 10416). </p>

<p align="center"><b>Elliott(1983-1999) 10459</b></p><p><b>10459.</b>
'That he saw the calf, and the dances' means the hellish worship, which was in keeping with the delight belonging to that nation's external kinds of love, and the consequent desire of their interiors 
to celebrate. This is clear from the meaning of 'the calf' as the delight belonging to that nation's external kinds of love, dealt with above in <a href="10407.htm">10407</a>, the reason why worship in keeping with that delight 
is meant here being that when Moses came near the camp that nation was engaged in such worship (that worship, as is clear from what has been shown above, has its origin in hell); and from the meaning 
of 'the dances' as desire of the interiors to celebrate, also dealt with above, in <a href="10416.htm">10416</a>.  </p>

`Et vidit vitulum et choreas': quod significet cultum infernalem, qui secundum jucundum amorum externorum illius gentis, ac inde festivitatem ejus interiorem, constat ex significatione `vituli' quod 
sit jucundum amorum externorum illius gentis, de qua supra n. 10,407; quod hic sit cultus secundum illud jucundum, est quia, cum appropinquabat Moscheh ad castra, {1}gens illa in eo cultu erat, qui cultus 
quod sit {2}ab inferno, constat ex illis quae {3}supra ostensa sunt; et ex significatione `chorearum' quod sint festivitas interior, de qua etiam supra n. 10,416. @1 in cultu erant$ @2 infernalis,
