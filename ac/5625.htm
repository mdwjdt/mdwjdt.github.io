<h3 align="center" class="ired">属天的奥秘 第5625节</h3>
<h4 align="center"></h4><p><strong>5625.</strong>“或许那是个错误”表免得他厌恶或不友好。这从“错误”的含义清楚可知：“错误”是指不友好的行为或厌恶的事，因为此处所指的错误是他们好像忘了付银子，所以把它带了回来，各人的银子在各自的口袋里；他有可能因此厌恶他们。事实上，他们自己以为事情会是这样，因为他们被领到约瑟屋里后就害怕说：我们被领到这地方，必是因为当初归还在我们口袋里的银子，痛责我们，抓住我们，把我们当奴仆，抢夺我们的驴（43:18）。此外，“罪”表示分离和厌恶（<a href="5229.htm">5229</a>，<a href="5474.htm">5474</a>节）；“错误”若有罪在里面，所表相同，只是程度低一些。这就是为何我们说“免得他厌恶或不友好”。</p>

Peradventure it was an error. That this signifies lest he be adverse, is evident from the signification of an "error," as being what is adverse, for the error here meant is as if they had forgotten to 
pay the silver and so were taking it back, everyone in his own sack; for which reason he might possibly be adverse to them, as they also believed; for they were afraid because they were brought to Joseph's 
house, and said, "Upon the word of the silver that was returned in our bags in the beginning are we brought, to roll down upon us, and to throw himself upon us, and to take us for servants, and 
our asses" (verse 18). Moreover "sin" signifies disjunction and aversion (n. 5229, 5474); and so does "error" if there is sin in it, but in a less degree; wherefore it is said "lest he be adverse." </p>

<p align="center"><b>Elliott(1983-1999) 5625</b></p><p><b>5625.</b>
'perhaps it was a mistake' means lest he becomes unfriendly. This is clear from the meaning of 'a mistake' as an unfriendly act, for an error of that kind is meant here. The mistake could have been that 
they had forgotten to hand over their silver and so had brought it back, each man's in his own sack; it could have been this that had caused the unfriendliness towards them. Indeed they themselves 
believed this to be so, for when in their fear they were brought to Joseph's house they said, </p>
<p>Over the matter of the silver put back in our pouches at the beginning are we brought to this place, so 
that he may come down on us and fall on us, and take us as slaves, and our asses. Verse 18. </p>
<p>Furthermore 'sin' means separation and an unfriendly turning away, <a href="5229.htm">5229</a>, <a href="5474.htm">5474</a>; so too does 'a mistake' 
if this entails some sin, though a minor one. This is why the expression 'lest he becomes unfriendly' is used. </p>

<p align="center"><b>Latin(1748-1756) 5625</b>
</p><b>5625.</b>
`Forte error hoc':  quod significet ne adversus sit, constat a significatione `erroris' quod sit adversum, nam talis error hic intelligitur, sicut quod obliti argentum dare et sic reduxerint illud quisque 
in suo sacco, ob quam causam illis adversus posset esse, ut quoque crediderunt, timuerunt enim quod adducti domum Josephi, et dixerunt, Super verbum argenti reducti in manticis nostris in initio 
nos adducimur, ad devolvendum super nos, et ad conjiciendum se super nos et ad sumendum nos ad servos, et asinos nostros, vers. 18; praeterea peccatum significat disjunctionem et aversionem, n. 5229, 
5474, ita `error' si ei peccatum inest, sed minorem, quapropter dicitur ne `adversus sit'. </p>
