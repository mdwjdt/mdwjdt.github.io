<h3 align="center" class="ired">属天的奥秘 第4677节</h3>
<h4 align="center"></h4><p><strong>4677.</strong>“他给约瑟作了一件彩衣”表由此产生的真理表象，属世层的属灵层通过这真理表象被认出和区分。这从“衣”和“彩”的含义清楚可知：“衣”是指属世层的真理，如下文所述；“彩（色）”是指真理的表象，属世层的属灵层凭这表象被认出并区分。没有人能知道“彩（色）”表示这些事物，除非他知道在来世和尘世一样可看到各种色彩，而且来世的色彩远远比尘世的色彩更美丽、种类更多，也除非他知道这些色彩的源头。来世所看到的色彩是由那里的光之变化产生的，可以说是聪明和智慧的改变；因为那里所看到的光是从主所接受的神性真理的显现，也就是来自祂的神性属灵层，或也可说，是在天使和灵人眼前显为光的神性聪明和智慧。由此可见由那里的光所产生的色彩表示什么，即表示真理的不同种类，因而表示它的表象，它们起因于对良善与真理的不同情感。关于来世的色彩或颜色，可参看前文（<a href="1042.htm">1042</a>，<a href="1043.htm">1043</a>，<a href="1053.htm">1053</a>，<a href="1624.htm">1624</a>，<a href="3993.htm">3993</a>，<a href="4530.htm">4530</a>节）。<br />前面说明（<a href="3301.htm">3301</a>节），“衣”表示属世层的真理，但这层意义没有从圣言其它经文得以证实，故在此引用这些经文。由于在犹太教会，王代表神性属灵层，或神性真理方面的主（<a href="2015.htm">2015</a>，<a href="2069.htm">2069</a>，<a href="3009.htm">3009</a>，<a href="3670.htm">3670</a>节），故他们的女儿身穿彩衣，因为“女儿”表示对良善与真理的情感，因而表示教会（参看<a href="2362.htm">2362</a>，<a href="3963.htm">3963</a>节）。关于她们，我们在撒母耳记下读到：<br />那时他玛，大卫的女儿，穿着彩衣，因为没有出嫁的公主都是穿这样的外袍。（撒母耳记下<a href="http://39-27.cn/撒下13.18.htm">13:18</a>）<br />由于大祭司代表神性属天层或神性良善方面的主，所以亚伦身穿代表源于主之神性良善的神性真理的圣衣；因为神性良善存在于主里面，而神性真理从祂发出，就是这些衣服所代表的。当主在彼此、雅各和约翰面前变了形像时，也是如此，因为神性良善显为日头，神性真理则表现为洁白如光的衣裳（马太福音<a href="http://39-27.cn/太17.2.htm">17:2</a>）。<br />亚伦和他儿子所穿的圣衣在摩西五经是这样来描述的：<br />要用细麻线织内袍，用细麻布作冠冕，又用绣花的手工作腰带。你要为亚伦的儿子作内袍，给他们作腰带，又给他们作裹头巾，为荣耀，为华美。（出埃及记<a href="http://39-27.cn/出28.39.htm">28:39</a>-<a href="http://39-27.cn/出28.40.htm">40</a>）<br />此处关于衣服的每个细节都表示属于源自主之神性良善的神性真理的某种事物，“细麻内袍”尤表神性属灵层。这同样适用于别处：<br />你要拿衣服，给亚伦穿上内袍和以弗得的外袍，并以弗得，又带上胸牌，束上以弗得的带子；要叫他的儿子来，给他们穿上内袍。（出埃及记<a href="http://39-27.cn/出29.5.htm">29:5</a>，<a href="http://39-27.cn/出29.8.htm">8</a>；<a href="http://39-27.cn/出40.14.htm">40:14</a>）<br />关于衣服的这些细节在此表示什么，蒙主的神性怜悯，等到论述它们的时候再予以说明。“衣服”一般表示真理（参看<a href="297.htm">297</a>，<a href="1073.htm">1073</a>，<a href="2576.htm">2576</a>，<a href="4545.htm">4545</a>节）。<br />先知也穿里衣（tunics），只是他们的里衣是毛发制成的。这是因为先知代表教义真理方面的主，还因为真理属于属世人或外在人；他们的里衣由毛发制成，“毛发”表示属世之物（<a href="3301.htm">3301</a>节）。<br />“里衣”表示从主所接受的神性真理，这一事实从新约中提及“里衣”的经文很明显地看出来，如约翰福音：<br />兵丁就拿祂的衣服分为四份，每兵一份；又拿里衣，这件里衣原来没有缝儿，是从上头一片织成的。他们就彼此说，我们不要撕开；这要应验经上的话说，他们彼此分了我的外衣，为我的里衣拈阄。（约翰福音<a href="http://39-27.cn/约19.23.htm">19:23</a>-<a href="http://39-27.cn/约19.24.htm">24</a>）<br />凡读到这些话的人以为它们没有更深层的秘密在里面，仅仅描述了这一事实：兵丁彼此分外衣，又为里衣拈阄。然而，此处的每一个细节都代表并表示某种神性之物；也就是关于外衣分为四份，里衣没有分，而是为它拈阄这两个细节，尤其关于里衣没有缝儿，是从上头一片织成的这个细节。“里衣”表示主的神性真理，神性真理因是独一的，且源于良善，故由“没有缝儿，从上头一片织成的”里衣来代表。<br />织成的“亚伦的内袍”或编织的工所表相同，这从摩西五经明显看出来：<br />他们用织成的细麻布，就是编织的工为亚伦和他的儿子作内袍。（出埃及记<a href="http://39-27.cn/出39.27.htm">39:27</a>）<br />没有缝的里衣还代表以下事实：主不容许神性真理被撕裂，就像犹太人向教会的低级真理所做的那样。<br />由于神性真理是独一的，也就是说，唯独源于神性良善，所以十二个门徒被差遣去传神国的福音时，被吩咐不要带两两件褂子。如路加福音：<br />耶稣差遣十二个门徒去宣传神的国，对他们说，不要带着什么上路，不要带拐杖和行囊，不要带食物和银子，也不要带两件褂子。（路加福音<a href="http://39-27.cn/路9.2.htm">9:2</a>-<a href="http://39-27.cn/路9.3.htm">3</a>）<br />马可福音：<br />祂嘱咐他们，除了拐杖以外，不要带着什么上路，不要带行囊和食物，腰袋里也不要带铜钱；只要穿鞋，也不要穿两件褂子。（马可福音<a href="http://39-27.cn/可6.8.htm">6:8</a>-<a href="http://39-27.cn/可6.9.htm">9</a>）<br />马太福音：<br />腰袋里不要带金银铜钱；途中不要带行囊，不要带两件褂子，也不要带两双鞋和两个拐杖。（马太福音<a href="http://39-27.cn/太10.9.htm">10:9</a>-<a href="http://39-27.cn/太10.10.htm">10</a>）<br />这些经文中的一切具体吩咐都是门徒被差遣所要宣传的主国度的属天和属灵事物的代表。他们之所以不要带金银铜钱，行囊和食物，是因为这些事物表示唯独从主所得来的良善与真理：“金”表示良善（<a href="113.htm">113</a>，<a href="1551.htm">1551</a>，<a href="1552.htm">1552</a>节）；“银”表示源于这良善的真理（<a href="1551.htm">1551</a>，<a href="2954.htm">2954</a>节）；“铜”表示属世良善（<a href="425.htm">425</a>，<a href="1551.htm">1551</a>节）；“食物”表示爱之良善，也就是属天良善（<a href="276.htm">276</a>，<a href="680.htm">680</a>，<a href="2165.htm">2165</a>，<a href="2177.htm">2177</a>，<a href="3478.htm">3478</a>，<a href="3735.htm">3735</a>，<a href="4211.htm">4211</a>，<a href="4217.htm">4217</a>节）。但“褂子”和“鞋”表示他们要被赋予的真理，“拐杖”表示源于良善的真理的能力。因为“杖”表示这种能力（参看<a href="4013.htm">4013</a>，<a href="4015.htm">4015</a>节）；“鞋”表示最低的属世层（<a href="1748.htm">1748</a>节），在此表示它的真理；“褂子”表示内层属世真理。由于这些事物都是成双的，而不是单个的，所以他们被禁止有两个拐杖、两双鞋，或两件褂子。这些就是包含在主的吩咐里面的奥秘；若不借助内义，人绝无可能获知这些奥秘。<br />主的一切具体吩咐都是神性事物，因而是其国度的属天和属灵事物的代表，因而既适合世人理解，同时适合灵人和天使理解。因此，主所说的这些话传遍并继续传遍整个天堂。由此明显可知，知道圣言的内义是何等宝贵和重要。若没有内义，谁都能利用圣言来支持凡他所喜欢的任何信条；由于对那些陷入邪恶的人来说，圣言的表象就是这样，所以他们嘲弄圣言，认为圣言根本不是神性。</p>

<p align="center"><b>Potts(1905-1910) 4677</b></p><p><b>4677.</b>
And he made him a tunic* of various colors. That this signifies the appearances of truth thence, whereby the spiritual of the natural is known and distinguished, is evident from the signification of 
a "tunic," as being the truth of the natural, of which hereafter; and from the signification of "various colors," as being the appearance of truth by which the spiritual of the natural is known and distinguished. 
That these are signified by "various colors" cannot be known by anyone unless he knows that colors appear in the other life equally as in the world-colors which in beauty and variety far 
surpass those in this world-and unless he knows what is the source of these colors. The colors seen in the other life are from the variation of the light there, and are so to speak modifications of intelligence 
and wisdom; for the light which appears there is from the Divine truth that is from the Lord, or is the Divine spiritual from Him, or what is the same, is Divine intelligence and wisdom, which 
appears as light before the eyes of angels and spirits. Hence it is evident what is signified by the colors from that light, namely, qualities of truth, thus its appearances, and that they appear 
from the affections of good and truth. (Concerning the colors in the other life see n. 1042, 1043, 1053, 1624, 3993, 4530.) [2] That a "tunic" is the truth of the natural was said above (n. 3301), but 
as it was not there shown, I may now confirm it here from other passages in the Word. As the kings in the Jewish Church represented the Lord as to the Divine spiritual, or Divine truth (n. 2015, 2069, 
3009, 3670), therefore their daughters were clothed in tunics of various colors, for by "daughters" were signified affections of good and truth, and therefore churches (see n. 2362, 3963); of whom 
we read in the second book of Samuel: </p>
<p>     There was upon Tamar, David's daughter, a tunic of various colors, for with such robes were the king's daughters that were virgins appareled (2 Sam. 13:16). [3] 
And because the high priests represented the Lord as to the Divine celestial or Divine good, Aaron was clothed in garments that represented the Divine truth which is from the Divine good of the 
Lord; for Divine good is in the Lord, but Divine truth proceeds from Him, and is what was represented by these garments. So also when the Lord was transfigured before Peter, James, and John, the Divine 
good appeared as the sun, and the Divine truth was presented as raiment which appeared as the light (Matt. 17:2). [4] The garments in which Aaron and his sons were clothed are thus described in Moses: </p>
<p> 
    Thou shalt make for Aaron a tunic of fine linen, and a miter of fine linen, and thou shalt make a belt, the work of the embroiderer. And for Aaron's sons thou shalt make tunics, and thou shalt 
make for them belts, and headtires shalt thou make for them, for glory and for adornment (Exod. 28:39-40). Every particular here signified something pertaining to the Divine truth from the Divine 
good of the Lord, the "tunic of fine linen" specifically signifying the Divine spiritual. So also in another place: </p>
<p>     Thou shalt take the garments, and put upon Aaron the tunic, and the robe of the 
ephod, and the ephod, and the breastplate, and shalt clothe him with the girdle of the ephod; afterwards thou shall cause his sons to approach, and put tunics upon them (Exod. 29:5, 8; 40:14). What 
these particulars signify will of the Lord's Divine mercy be shown when they come to be treated of. (That "garments" in general are truths, see n. 297, 1073, 2576, 4545.) [5] The prophets also were 
clothed in tunics, but in tunics of hair; because by the prophets the Lord was represented as to truths of doctrine, and because these are of the natural or external man, the prophets had tunics of hair, 
for "hair" signifies what is natural (n. 3301). [6] That a "tunic" signifies Divine truth from the Lord, is still more obvious from those passages in the New Testament in which "tunic" is mentioned, 
as in John: </p>
<p>     The soldiers took His garments and made four parts, to every soldier a part, and also the tunic; now the tunic was without seam, woven from the top throughout. They said therefore 
one to another, Let us not divide it, that the Scripture might be fulfilled which saith, They divided my vestments among them, and upon my tunic did they cast a lot (John 19:23-24); </p>
<p>one who reads these 
words supposes that they involve no greater mystery than that the vestments were divided among the soldiers, and that a lot was cast upon the tunic, and yet every particular was representative and 
significative of something Divine, as well that the vestments were divided into four parts, as that the tunic was not divided, but upon it was cast a lot, especially that the tunic was without seam 
and woven from the top throughout; for by the "tunic" was signified the Lord's Divine truth, which as being one only and from good, was represented by the tunic being without seam and woven from the top 
throughout [7] The like was signified by the "tunic of Aaron," which was woven, or the work of the weaver, as is evident from Moses: </p>
<p>     They made the tunics of fine linen, the work of the weaver, 
for Aaron and for his sons (Exod. 39:27). There was also represented that the Lord did not suffer Divine truth to be rent into parts, as was done by the Jews with the lower truths of the church. [8] 
Because Divine truth which is from Divine good is one only, the twelve disciples when sent to preach the gospel of the kingdom were commanded not to have two tunics; as in Luke: </p>
<p>     Jesus sent the 
twelve disciples to preach the kingdom of God; and He said unto them, Take nothing for the way, neither staves, nor bag, nor bread, nor silver; neither have two tunics apiece (Luke 9:2-3); </p>
<p>and in 
Mark: </p>
<p>     He commanded them that they should take nothing for the way save a staff only, no bag, no bread, no brass in their belt; but be clad with shoes; and put not on two tunics (Mark 6:8-9); </p>
<p>And 
in Matthew: </p>
<p>     Possess neither gold, nor silver, nor brass in your belts, nor bag for the way, nor two tunics, nor shoes, nor staves (Matt. 10:9-10). [9] All the particulars herein are representative 
of the celestial and spiritual things of the Lord's kingdom which the disciples were sent to preach. That they were not to take with them gold, silver, brass, bag, nor bread, was because these things 
signified goods and truths which are from the Lord alone - "gold" signifying good (n. 113, 1551, 1552); "silver," truth therefrom (n. 1551, 2954); "brass," natural good (n. 425, 1551); "bread," 
the good of love or celestial good (n. 276, 680, 2165, 2177, 3478, 3735, 4211, 4217). But the "tunic" and "shoe" signified the truths with which they were clothed, and the "staff" the power of truth from 
good. (That a "staff" is this power may be seen above, n. 4013, 4015; and that a "shoe" is the lowest natural, n. 1748, here as to truth.) A "tunic" is interior natural truth, and because these things 
ought not to be double, but single, it was forbidden to have two staves, two pairs of shoes, or two tunics. These arcana are within this command of the Lord, and cannot possibly be known except from 
the internal sense. [10] All and each of the things the Lord said were representative of Divine things, consequently of the celestial and spiritual things of His kingdom, and thus were adapted to 
the apprehension of men, and at the same time to the understanding of spirits and angels; wherefore those things which the Lord said, filled and continue to fill the whole heaven. From this it is evident 
of what use and importance it is to know the internal sense of the Word. Moreover, without this sense anyone can confirm from the Word whatever dogma he pleases; and because such is the appearance 
of the Word to those who are in evil, they therefore deride it, and are ready to believe anything rather than that it is Divine. * The "tunic" was the under garment.  </p>

<p align="center"><b>Elliott(1983-1999) 4677</b></p><p><b>4677.</b>
'And he made him a tunic of various colours' means the resulting appearances of truth by which the spiritual of the natural is recognized and distinguished. This is clear from the meaning of 'a tunic' 
as the truth of the natural, dealt with below; and from the meaning of 'various colours' as appearances of truth by which the spiritual of the natural is recognized and distinguished. No one can know 
that these things are meant by 'various colours' unless he knows that colours may be seen in the next life no less than in the world - colours which are far more beautiful and various - and unless he 
knows the origins of those colours. Colours seen in the next life are produced by the variegation of light there and are so to speak modifications of intelligence and wisdom, for the light which is 
seen there is a manifestation of Divine Truth received from the Lord, that is, it is the Divine Spiritual from Him, or what amounts to the same, is Divine Intelligence and Wisdom. These two are seen as 
light before the eyes of angels and spirits. From this one may see what is meant by the colours being products of that light, namely different kinds and so appearances of truth that are due to varying 
affections for good and truth. Regarding colours in the next life, see <a href="1042.htm">1042</a>, <a href="1043.htm">1043</a>, <a href="1053.htm">1053</a>, <a href="1624.htm">1624</a>, <a href="3993.htm">3993</a>, <a href="4530.htm">4530</a>. </p>
<p></p>
<p><b>[2]</b>
 It has been stated already in <a href="3301.htm">3301</a> that 'a tunic' means the truth of the natural, but 
as this meaning was not substantiated there from other places in the Word, let these be mentioned here. Because kings in the Jewish Church represented the Lord as regards the Divine Spiritual or Divine 
Truth, <a href="2015.htm">2015</a>, <a href="2069.htm">2069</a>, <a href="3009.htm">3009</a>, <a href="3670.htm">3670</a>, their daughters therefore wore tunics of various colours, for 'daughters' meant affections for good and truth, and so meant Churches, <a href="2362.htm">2362</a>, <a href="3963.htm">3963</a>. The following is said 
of them in the second Book of Samuel, </p>
<blockquote>
On Tamar, David's daughter, there was a tunic of various colours, for virgin daughters of the king wore such clothes. <a href="http://bible.gospelcom.net/cgi-bin/bible?passage=2%20Sam%2013:18&amp;version=ESV&amp;interface=print&amp;showfn=yes&amp;showxref">2 Sam 13:18</a>. 
</blockquote>
<p></p>
<p><b>[3]</b>
 And because high 
priests represented the Lord as regards the Divine  Celestial or Divine Good, Aaron therefore wore vestments which represented Divine Truth that was derived from the Lord's Divine Good; for Divine Good 
exists within the Lord, whereas Divine Truth proceeds from Him. This was what those vestments represented. Something similar was represented when the Lord was transfigured before Peter, James, and 
John, in that Divine Good was seen as the sun, and Divine Truth was manifested by means of His garments which had the appearance of light, <a href="http://bible.gospelcom.net/cgi-bin/bible?passage=Matt%2017:2&amp;version=ESV&amp;interface=print&amp;showfn=yes&amp;showxref">Matt 17:2</a>. </p>
<p></p>
<p><b>[4]</b>
 Regarding the vestments worn by Aaron and 
his sons, the following is said in Moses, </p>
<blockquote>
You shall make for Aaron a tunic of fine linen, and a turban of fine linen; and you shall make a girdle, the work of an embroiderer. And you shall make tunics 
for Aaron's sons, and you shall make girdles for them, and you shall make head-coverings for them, for glory and adornment. <a href="http://bible.gospelcom.net/cgi-bin/bible?passage=Exod%2028:39,%2040&amp;version=ESV&amp;interface=print&amp;showfn=yes&amp;showxref">Exod 28:39, 40</a>. 
</blockquote>
<p>Each article of clothing here meant something connected 
with Divine Truth  derived from the Lord's Divine Good, 'a tunic of fine linen' meaning specifically the Divine Spiritual. The same applies elsewhere in the same author, </p>
<blockquote>
You shall take the vestments, 
and put the tunic on Aaron, and the robe of the ephod, and the ephod, and the breastplate, and you shall clothe him with the girdle of the ephod. Then you shall cause his sons to come near, and 
you shall put them in tunics. <a href="http://bible.gospelcom.net/cgi-bin/bible?passage=Exod%2029:5,%208;%2040:14&amp;version=ESV&amp;interface=print&amp;showfn=yes&amp;showxref">Exod 29:5, 8; 40:14</a>. 
</blockquote>
<p>What each article of clothing means here will in the Lord's Divine mercy be stated when those verses come up for consideration. 'Garments' in 
general are truths, see <a href="297.htm">297</a>, <a href="1073.htm">1073</a>, <a href="2576.htm">2576</a>, <a href="4545.htm">4545</a>. </p>
<p></p>
<p><b>[5]</b>
 Prophets too wore tunics, though theirs were made of hair. This was because prophets represented the Lord as regards truths of doctrine, and since 
truths belong to the natural or external man, their tunics were made of hair - 'hair' meaning the natural, see <a href="3301.htm">3301</a>. </p>
<p></p>
<p><b>[6]</b>
 The fact that 'a tunic' means Divine Truth received from the Lord is evident 
further still from those places where a tunic is mentioned in the New Testament, as in John, </p>
<blockquote>
The soldiers took His garments and made four parts, a part for each soldier, and His tunic. But the tunic 
was without seam, woven from the top throughout. Therefore they said to one another, Let us not divide it- so that the Scripture might be fulfilled, saying They divided My garments for themselves, 
and for My tunic they cast lots. <a href="http://bible.gospelcom.net/cgi-bin/bible?passage=John%2019:23,%2024&amp;version=ESV&amp;interface=print&amp;showfn=yes&amp;showxref">John 19:23, 24</a>. 
</blockquote>
<p>Anyone reading this description supposes that it does not hold anything deeper within it than the facts that the garments were divided among the soldiers 
and that lots were cast for the tunic. But each detail described here represented and meant spiritually something Divine - that is to say, those two details about the garments being divided into 
four and about the tunic not being divided but having lots cast for it, and above all the detail about the tunic being without seam and woven from the top throughout. 'The tunic' meant the Lord's Divine 
Truth, which being singular - derived from Good - was represented by the tunic's being without seam and woven from the top throughout. </p>
<p></p>
<p><b>[7]</b>
 Much the same was meant by Aaron's tunic which, as is 
evident in Moses, was woven or the work of a weaver, </p>
<blockquote>
They made tunics of fine linen, the work of a weaver, for Aaron and his sons <a href="http://bible.gospelcom.net/cgi-bin/bible?passage=Exod%2039:27&amp;version=ESV&amp;interface=print&amp;showfn=yes&amp;showxref">Exod 39:27</a>. 
</blockquote>
<p>Also represented by the tunic without seam was the 
fact that the Lord did not allow Divine Truth to be torn apart, as was done by the Jews to the lower truths of the Church. </p>
<p></p>
<p><b>[8]</b>
 Because Divine Truth is singular - that is to say, it is derived solely 
from Divine Good - the twelve disciples were commanded, when they were being sent out to preach the gospel of the kingdom, not to have two tunics. This is recorded in Luke as follows, </p>
<blockquote>
Jesus sent 
the twelve disciples to preach the kingdom of God. And He said to them, Take nothing for the way, neither staves, nor bag, nor bread, nor silver, nor have two tunics each. <a href="http://bible.gospelcom.net/cgi-bin/bible?passage=Luke%209:2,%203&amp;version=ESV&amp;interface=print&amp;showfn=yes&amp;showxref">Luke 9:2, 3</a>. 
</blockquote>
<p>In Mark, </p>
<blockquote>
He 
charged them to take nothing for the way except a staff; not a bag, nor bread, nor bronze in the belt, but to wear sandals; and do not put on two tunics. <a href="http://bible.gospelcom.net/cgi-bin/bible?passage=Mark%206:8,%209&amp;version=ESV&amp;interface=print&amp;showfn=yes&amp;showxref">Mark 6:8, 9</a>. 
</blockquote>
<p>And in Matthew, </p>

<p><b>[9]</b>
 All the individual instructions given in these places are representative 
of the celestial and spiritual things of the Lord's kingdom which the disciples were sent to preach. The reason they were not to take gold, silver, bronze, bag, or bread with them was that those 
things meant different kinds of good and truth received from the Lord alone. 'Gold' means good, <a href="113.htm">113</a>, <a href="1551.htm">1551</a>, <a href="1552.htm">1552</a>, while 'silver' means truth derived from that good, <a href="1551.htm">1551</a>, <a href="2954.htm">2954</a>; 'bronze' means natural 
good, <a href="425.htm">425</a>, <a href="1551.htm">1551</a>, and 'bread' the good of love, which is heavenly good, <a href="276.htm">276</a>, <a href="680.htm">680</a>, <a href="2165.htm">2165</a>, <a href="2177.htm">2177</a>, <a href="3478.htm">3478</a>, <a href="3735.htm">3735</a>, <a href="4211.htm">4211</a>, <a href="4217.htm">4217</a>. 'Tunic' however and 'sandal' meant the truths with which they were to be endued, 
and 'staff the power of truth derived from good For 'staff' means that power, see <a href="4013.htm">4013</a>, <a href="4015.htm">4015</a>; 'sandal' the lowest natural, <a href="1748.htm">1748</a>, here its truth; and 'tunic' interior natural truth. Now because these 
things had to be not twofold but singular, they were forbidden to have two staves, two pairs of sandals, or two tunics. These are the arcana contained in what the Lord commanded, but no one can possibly 
know about them except from the internal sense. </p>

<p><b>[10]</b>
 All the detailed instructions spoken by the Lord were representative of Divine things, and consequently of the celestial and spiritual things 
of His kingdom. They were accordingly suited to the mental grasp of men and at the same time to the understanding of spirits and angels. Therefore the things spoken by the Lord pervaded the whole of 
heaven and continue to do so. From this it is also evident how valuable and important it is to know the internal sense of the Word. Without it anyone can use the Word to support whatever dogma he likes; 
and because this is seen to be so by those who are subject to evil, they therefore deride the Word and think it is anything but Divine. </p>

`Et fecit ei tunicam variorum colorum': quod significet apparentias veri inde ex quibus spirituale naturalis cognoscitur et distinguitur, constat ex significatione `tunicae' quod sit verum naturalis, 
de qua sequitur; et ex significatione `variorum colorum' quod sint apparentiae veri ex quibus spirituale naturalis cognoscitur [et] distinguitur; quod haec per varios colores significentur, a 
nemine sciri potest nisi qui scit quod colores in altera vita aeque appareant sicut in mundo, et quidem colores qui pulchritudine et varietate multum excedunt hos, et nisi qui scit unde colores illi; 
colores qui in altera vita, sunt ex variegatione lucis ibi et sunt, ut ita dicatur, modificationes intelligentiae et sapientiae, nam lux quae ibi apparet, est ex Divino Vero quod a Domino, seu est 
Divinum Spirituale ab Ipso, seu quod idem, est Divina Intelligentia et Sapientia {1}; haec sicut lux apparet coram oculis angelorum et spirituum; inde patet quid per colores ex luce illa significatur, 
quod nempe qualitates veri, ita apparentiae ejus, et quod appareant ex affectionibus boni et veri; de coloribus altera vita, videantur n. 1042, 1043, 1053, 1624, 3993, 4530.  [2] Quod `tunica' 
sit verum naturalis, prius n. 3301 dictum est, sed quia ibi non ostensum, licet hic ex aliis locis in Verbo id confirmare; quia reges in Ecclesia Judaica repraesentabant Dominum quoad Divinum Spirituale 
seu Divinum Verum, n. 2015, 2069, 3009, 3670, ideo filiae eorum vestiebantur tunicis variorum colorum; per `filias' enim significabantur affectiones boni et veri, et inde Ecclesiae, n. 2362, 
3963; de quibus  {2} in Libro 2 Samuelis           Erat super Tamare filia Davidis tunica variorum      colorum, quia talibus vestiebantur filiae regis virgines      amiculis, xiii 18. [3] Et quia 
summi sacerdotes repraesentabant Dominum quoad Divinum Caeleste seu Divinum Bonum, ideo Aharon induebatur vestibus quae repraesentabant Divinum Verum quod ex Divino Bono Domini; Divinum enim Bonum 
est in Domino, at Divinum Verum procedit ab Ipso; hoc erat quod repraesentabatur per `vestes'; similiter ac cum transformatus Dominus coram Petro, Jacobo, et Johanne, Divinum Bonum apparuit ut 
sol, et Divinum Verum sistebatur per vestimenta quae apparebant sicut lux, Matth. xvii 2; [4] de vestibus quibus induebatur Aharon et filii ejus, ita apud Mosen,           Aharoni facies tunicam xylini, 
cidarim xylini, et      balteum facies opus acupictoris: et filiis Aharonis facies      tunicas, et facies illis balteos, et tiaras facies illis ad      gloriam et ad decus, Exod. xxviii 39, 
40; </p>
<p>singula haec significabant illa quae sunt Divini Veri a Divino Bono Domini, `tunica xylini' Divinum Spirituale in specie: similiter alibi apud eundem,           Sumes vestes, et indues Aharoni 
tunicam, et pallium      ephodi, et ephodum, et pectorale, et amicies illum cingulo      ephodi;... postea filios ejus appropinquare facies, et      indues illos tunicis, Exod. xxix 5, 8; xi 14; </p>
<p>quid 
singula haec significant, ex Divina Domini Misericordia, dicetur ubi de illis agendum; quod `vestes' in genere sint vera, videatur n. 297, 1073, 2576, 4545.  [5] Prophetae etiam induebantur tunicis, 
sed tunicis pili, quia per `prophetas' repraesentabatur Dominus quoad vera doctrinae, et quia haec sunt naturalis `seu externi' hominis, illis erant tunicae ex pilo, `pilus' enim significat 
naturale, videatur n. 3301.  [6] Quod `tunica' significet Divinum Verum a Domino, manifestius adhuc patet ex illis locis ubi tunica' nominatur in Novo Testamento; ut apud Johannem,           Milites 
acceperunt vestimenta Ipsius, et fecerunt      quatuor partes, unicuique militi partem, et tunicam; erat      autem tunica inconsuta, desuper texta per totum; dixerunt      itaque ad se invicem, 
Ne dividamus eam; ut Scriptura      impleretur, dicens, Diviserunt vestimenta Mea sibi ipsis, et      super tunicam Meam jecerunt sortem, xix 23, 24; </p>
<p>qui haec legit, putat quod ea non plus arcani involvant 
quam quod vestimenta fuerint inter milites divisa et quod super tunicam jacta sit sors, cum tamen singula fuerunt repraesentativa et significativa Divinorum, tam scilicet quod `vestimenta 
in quatuor partes divisa fuerint', quam quod `tunica non divisa, sed super illam jacta sors', cumprimis quod `tunica fuerit inconsuta et desuper texta per totum'; per `tunicam' enim significabatur 
Divinum Verum Domini, quod quia unicum est et ex Bono, repraesentabatur per `tunicam quod inconsuta et desuper texta per totum'; [7] simile significabatur per tunicam Aharonis, quae quod fuerit texta 
seu opus textoris, patet apud Mosen,           Fecerunt tunicas xylini opus textoris pro Aharone et      filiis ejus, Exod. xxxix 27; </p>
<p>et quoque repraesentabatur quod Dominus non passus sit ut Divinum Verum 
in partes distraheretur, sicut factum cum veris inferioribus Ecclesiae a Judaeis.  [8] Quia Divinum Verum est unicum, nempe quod ex Divino Bono, etiam mandatum (o)duodecim discipulis cum mitterentur 
ad praedicandum evangelium regni, ut non duas tunicas haberent, de quibus ita apud Lucam,           Jesus misit duodecim discipulos praedicare regnum Dei; </p>
<p>     et dixit ad illos, Nihil 
sumite in viam, neque baculos,      neque peram, neque panem, neque argentum, neque singuli duas      tunicas habere, ix 2, 3: </p>
<p>apud Marcum,           Praecepit illis, ut nihil sumerent in viam, 
nisi  baculum tantum, non peram, non panem, non in zona aes, sed     indutos calceos, nec induemini duabus tunicis, vi 8, 9: </p>
<p>et apud Matthaeum,           Non possideatis aurum, neque argentum, neque 
aes in      zonis vestris, nec {3} peram in viam, neque binas tunicas,      neque calceos, neque baculos, x 9, 10; </p>
<p>[9] singula ibi repraesentativa sunt caelestium et spiritualium regni Domini 
ad quod praedicandum missi sunt; quod `non sumerent aurum, argentum, aes, peram, panem secum' erat quia illa significabant bona et vera quae ex solo Domino, `aurum' nempe bonum, n. 113, 1551, 1552; 
`argentum' autem verum (o)inde, n. 1551, 2954; `aes' bonum naturale, n. 425, 1551; `panis' bonum amoris seu caeleste, n. 276, 680, 2165, 2177, 3478, 3735, 4211, 4217; `tunica' autem et `calceus' 
significabant vera quibus induerentur, et `baculus' potentiam veri ex bono; quod baculus sit potentia illa, videatur n. 4013, 4015; quod `calceus' sit infimum naturale, n. 1748, ibi quoad verum {4}; 
`tunica' est verum interius naturale; </p>
<p>quia haec non duplicia erunt sed unica, prohibebatur ne duos baculos, duo paria calceorum et duas tunicas haberent: haec arcana sunt in mandato illo Domini, 
quae nequaquam sciri nisi ex sensu interno possunt.  [10] Omnia et singula quae Dominus locutus, erant repraesentativa Divinorum, {5} consequenter caelestium et spiritualium regni Ipsius, et sic adaequata 
captui hominum, et simul intellectui spirituum et angelorum; quapropter illa quae Dominus locutus impleverunt et adimplent universum caelum; inde etiam patet quantum conducit et interest nosse 
sensum internum Verbi; absque illo etiam {6} quisque ex Verbo confirmare potest quodcumque libet dogma, et quia tale apparet illis qui in malo {7} sunt, Verbum inde subsannant, et nihil minus credunt 
quam quod Divinum sit.      @1 , quae$      @2 illis$      @3 non$      @4 ibi verum ejus$      @5 i et$      @6 enim$      @7 malis$ </p>
