<h3 align="center" class="ired">属天的奥秘 第10637节</h3>
<h4 align="center"></h4><p><strong>10637</strong>.“我今天所吩咐你的，你要谨守”表如果他们执行永恒真理所规定的这些首要的事。这从“你要谨守”和“耶和华今天所吩咐的”的含义清楚可知：“你要谨守”是指如果那些承认圣言的人如此行，因为“摩西”代表圣言，如前所述；“耶和华今天所吩咐的”是指永恒真理所规定的首要的事，因为耶和华所吩咐的事都是神性真理，“今天”表示永恒之物（<a href="2838.htm">2838</a>，<a href="3998.htm">3998</a>，<a href="4304.htm">4304</a>，<a href="6165.htm">6165</a>，<a href="6984.htm">6984</a>，<a href="9939.htm">9939</a>节）。这些永恒真理就是下面12-27经文在内在意义上所包含的。但包含在外在意义中的事物不是永恒真理，仅仅是要求以色列民族必须遵守的律法，因为这些律法含有真理在里面；它们表示、因而包含这些真理。此外，这个民族需要遵守这些律法，直到主揭开圣言的内在事物；一旦这些内在事物被揭开，包含它们的外在律法就被废除。当一个人以对主的信和爱来敬拜祂时，他就不需要用来表示这些内在事物的外在事物了；因为那时，与他同住的，是这些内在事物本身，而不是它们的象征和影子。例如，在亚比月要守无酵饼的节，在此期间要吃无酵饼七天；凡开了子宫的都要归给神；在驴中凡开了子宫的，都要赎出来；要守七七节，还要守收藏节；一切男丁要一年三次朝见耶和华的面；他们不可将我祭牲和有酵之物一同献上；不可用山羊羔母的奶煮山羊羔。不过，尽管这些外在律法被废除，但它们仍是圣言的神圣和神性的事物，因为它们里面有一种神圣的内在之物。</p>

Keep thou that which I command thee this day. That this signifies if they do these primary things which are of the eternal truth, is evident from the signification of "keep thou," as being if those do 
so who acknowledge the Word, for by Moses is represented the Word (see above); and from the signification of "that which Jehovah commands this day," as being the primary things which are of the eternal 
truth, for the things which Jehovah commands are Divine truths; and by "this day" is signified what is eternal (n. 2838, 3998, 4304, 6165, 6984, 9939). These eternal truths are what are contained 
in the internal sense in verses 12 to 27, which follow. The things contained in the external sense are not eternal truths, but are things that were to be observed by the Israelitish nation for the sake 
of things internal; for they signify these, and thus involve them. Moreover, these things were to be kept by that nation until the internal things of the Word had been opened by the Lord; but when these 
had been opened, then these external things were abrogated. For when a man worships the Lord from faith in Him and from love to Him, which are internal things, he has no need of the external things 
which signify these internal things, because he is then in these, and not in their symbols. For example, the feast of unleavened bread was to be kept in the month Abib, and then unleavened bread was 
to be eaten seven days; everything that opens the womb was to be given to God; the firstling of an ass was to be redeemed, or its neck broken; the firstborn sons were to be redeemed; the feast of weeks 
was to be observed, also the feast of ingathering; three times in the year all the males were to appear before Jehovah; they were not to sacrifice upon what is leavened; a kid was not to be seethed 
in its mother's milk. But although these things have been abrogated, they nevertheless are holy Divine things of the Word, because there is a holy internal in them. </p>

'Observe that which I command you this day' means, if they carry out those chief things laid down by eternal truth. This is clear from the meaning of 'observing' as, if those who acknowledge the Word 
do so, for 'Moses' [to whom the command 'Observe' is addressed] represents the Word, as above; and from the meaning of 'that which Jehovah commands this day' as the chief things laid down by eternal 
truth, for the things that Jehovah commands are Divine Truths, and 'this day' means what is eternal, <a href="2838.htm">2838</a>, <a href="3998.htm">3998</a>, <a href="4304.htm">4304</a>, <a href="6165.htm">6165</a>, <a href="6984.htm">6984</a>, <a href="9939.htm">9939</a>. Those eternal truths are what verses 12-27 below contain in the 
internal sense. But the matters contained in the external sense are not eternal truths, only laws that the Israelite nation was required to adhere to because of the truths those laws held within them, 
for they serve to mean and so incorporate those truths. Furthermore the need for that nation to adhere to those laws existed up until the Lord disclosed the inner reaches of the Word; once these had 
been disclosed the outward laws incorporating them were set aside. For when a person worships the Lord in faith and love for Him, which are internal things, he has no need of the external things serving 
to mean them; for then those internal things themselves reside with him, and not types and shadows of them. All this was so with the commands that the feast of unleavened bread should be kept in the 
month of Abib and that during it unleavened bread should be eaten for seven days; that all things opening the womb should be given to God; that whatever opened the womb among asses should be redeemed 
or else have its neck broken; that the firstborn of sons were to be redeemed; that the feast of weeks should be celebrated, and also the feast of ingathering; that three times in the year every male 
should be seen before Jehovah; that they should not offer sacrifices with anything made from yeast; and that a kid should not be boiled in its mother's milk. But although obedience to these outward 
laws has been set aside they are still the holy and Divine things of the Word, because what they hold within them internally is holy.  </p>

`Custodi tibi quod Ego praecipio tibi hodie':  quod significet si faciant primaria haec quae sunt aeternae veritatis, constat ex significatione `custodire tibi' quod sit si (t)faciant ita qui agnoscunt 
Verbum, nam per Moschen repraesentatur Verbum, ut supra; et ex significatione `quod Jehovah praecipit hodie' quod sint primaria quae aeternae veritatis, nam quae Jehovah praecipit sunt Divinae Veritates, 
et per `hodie' significatur aeternum, n. 2838, 3998, 4304, 6165, 6984, 9939; aeternae illae veritates sunt quae in sequentibus vers. 12-27 continentur in sensu interno; quae autem continentur 
in sensu externo, non sunt aeternae veritates sed sunt quae observanda a gente Israelitica propter interna, significant enim ea, et sic involvunt ea; etiam custodienda erant ab illa gente antequam interna 
Verbi a Domino aperta sunt, et {1}cum aperta sunt, tunc externa illa abrogata sunt; nam cum homo colit Dominum ex fide et ex amore in Ipsum, quae sunt interna non opus {2}habet externis significantibus 
illa, est enim tunc in illis, et non in typis illorum; sicut quod festum azymorum custodiendum in mense Abib et quod tunc azyma septem diebus comedenda, quod omnis apertura uteri danda Deo, quod 
apertura asini redimenda vel decollanda, quod primogeniti filiorum redimendi, quod festum septimanarum feriandum, ut et festum collectionis, quod tribus vicibus in anno videretur omnis masculus coram 
Jehovah, quod non sacrificarent super fermentato, quod non elixandus haedus in lacte matris suae.  Sed haec tametsi abrogata sunt, usque sunt sancta Divina Verbi (m)quoniam sanctum internum in illis
