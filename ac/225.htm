<h4 align="center"></h4><p><strong>225.</strong>“园里的树”表属世之善，当中尚存有被称为一棵“树”的一丝觉知。这一点，从属天之人所居的“园子”亦可明了，因为良善与真理被统称为一座“园子”，该园子照各人的培养而异。良善须有属天之性在其核心，藉此属天之性，觉知从主而来。此核心在此被称为“中”，在圣经其它各处亦复如是。</p>

<p><strong>[NCE]225.</strong> The middle of the tree of the garden symbolizes earthly good that brings with it a certain amount of perception, the latter being called the tree here. This symbolism can also be seen from [the meaning of] the garden that the heavenly person inhabited, because anything that is good or true is called a garden. The connotations vary, depending on the person who cultivates it.<br />Good is not good unless it has at its core something heavenly that supplies perception, or that allows the Lord to supply it. This core is called the middle and the Word uses the term the same way. </p>
<p align="center"><b>Potts(1905-1910) 225</b></p><p><b>225.</b>
That the "midst of the tree of the garden" signifies natural good, in which there is some perception which is called a "tree" is also evident from the "garden" in which the celestial man dwelt; for everything 
good and true is called a "garden" with a difference according to the man who cultivates it. Good is not good unless its inmost is celestial, from which, or through which, from the Lord, comes 
perception. This inmost is here called the "midst" as also elsewhere in the Word. </p>

<p align="center"><b>Elliott(1983-1999) 225</b></p><p><b>225.</b>
The middle of the tree of the garden' means natural good containing some perception, which is called 'a tree'. This also becomes clear from the garden in which celestial man lived, for everything good 
and true is called a garden, with variation depending on the person who tends it. Good is not really good unless its inmost is celestial, from which, or rather from the Lord by way of which, perception 
comes. This inmost is called 'the middle', as also in other parts of the Word.  </p>

<p align="center"><b>Latin(1748-1756) 225</b>
</p><b>225.</b>
Quod 'medium arboris horti' significet bonum naturale quo aliqua perceptio, quae vocatur 'arbor,' constare potest etiam ab horto in quo fuit caelestis homo; nam omne id vocatur hortus quod bonum et 
verum, cum differentia secundum hominem qui illum colit.  Bonum non est bonum nisi intimum ejus sit caeleste, ex quo seu per quod a Domino, perceptio; intimum hoc vocatur 'medium,' etiam [alibi] in Verbo.
