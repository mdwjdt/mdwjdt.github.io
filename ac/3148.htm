<h3 align="center" class="ired">属天的奥秘 第3148节</h3>
<h4 align="center"></h4><p><strong>3148.</strong>“给与他同来的人洗脚”表属世人中属于祂的一切事物的洁净。这从“脚”和“与他同来的人”的含义清楚可知：“脚”是指属世人的事物（参看<a href="2162.htm">2162</a>节）；“与他同来的人”是指属世人中的一切事物。旅行者习惯于一进家就洗脚；如约瑟的哥哥们被带到他家里时的情形 （创世记<a href="http://39-27.cn/创43.24.htm">43:24</a>）；利未和他的随从被接到老人家里时的情形（士师记<a href="http://39-27.cn/士19.21.htm">19:21</a>）；乌利亚一回来，大卫就吩咐他回家洗脚（撒母耳记下<a href="http://39-27.cn/撒下11.8.htm">11:8</a>）。之所以有这样的习俗，是因为寄居和旅行表示与教导、因而与生活有关的事物（参看<a href="1293.htm">1293</a>，<a href="1457.htm">1457</a>，<a href="1463.htm">1463</a>，<a href="2025.htm">2025</a>节）；这些必须被洁净，如前所述（<a href="3147.htm">3147</a>节）。还有一个原因是，属灵意义上的污秽不可附到并玷污房屋或家，也就是人。这也可从以下要求明显看出来：若有一城或一家不接受平安，他们要把脚上的尘土跺下去（马太福音<a href="http://39-27.cn/太10.14.htm">10:14</a>）。</p>

And the feet of the men that were with him. That this signifies the purification of all things belonging to Him, in the natural man, is evident from the signification of "feet," as being the things of 
the natural man (see n. 2162); and from the signification of "the men that were with him," as being all things there. It was the custom for travelers, when they came into any house, to wash their feet; 
as when the brethren of Joseph were introduced into Joseph's house (Gen. 43:24); and when the Levite and his attendant were received into the house of the old man (Judges 19:21); and when Uriah on 
his return home was commanded by David to go down to his house and to wash his feet (2 Sam. 11:8). The reason was that traveling and journeying signified what relates to instruction, and thence to life 
(see n. 1293, 1457, 1463, 2025); and that these were to be purified was shown above; and further, lest the impurity understood in the spiritual sense should adhere, and defile the house, that is, the 
man; as is also evident from the fact that the disciples were to shake off the dust of the feet, if the city or the house would not receive peace (Matt. 10:14). </p>

'And the feet of the men who were with him' means purification of all things that were His in the natural man. This is clear from the meaning of 'the feet' as the things that belong to the natural man, 
dealt with in <a href="2162.htm">2162</a>, and from the meaning of 'the men who were with him' as all things in the natural man. It was customary for wayfarers on entering any house to wash their feet, as when Joseph's brothers 
were brought into his house, <a href="http://bible.gospelcom.net/cgi-bin/bible?passage=Gen%2043:24&amp;version=ESV&amp;interface=print&amp;showfn=yes&amp;showxref">Gen 43:24</a>; when the Levite and those accompanying him were received into the old man's house, <a href="http://bible.gospelcom.net/cgi-bin/bible?passage=Judg%2019:21&amp;version=ESV&amp;interface=print&amp;showfn=yes&amp;showxref">Judg 19:21</a>; and when Uriah after his journey was ordered by David to 
go down to his house and to wash his feet, <a href="http://bible.gospelcom.net/cgi-bin/bible?passage=2%20Sam%2011:8&amp;version=ESV&amp;interface=print&amp;showfn=yes&amp;showxref">2 Sam 11:8</a>. The reason for this custom was that journeys and travels meant things to do with instruction, and consequently with life, see <a href="1293.htm">1293</a>, <a href="1457.htm">1457</a>, <a href="1463.htm">1463</a>, <a href="2025.htm">2025</a>, and that these had to be purified, as shown just above in <a href="3147.htm">3147</a>. And there was the added reason that the filth that is meant in the spiritual sense should not cling to and defile the house, which 
is the human being, as also is evident from the requirement that they were to shake off the dust on their feet if a city or house did not receive peace, <a href="http://bible.gospelcom.net/cgi-bin/bible?passage=Matt%2010:14&amp;version=ESV&amp;interface=print&amp;showfn=yes&amp;showxref">Matt 10:14</a>. </p>

</p><b>3148.</b>
`Et pedes virorum qui cum illo': quod significet purificationem omnium quae Illius in naturali homine, constat a significatione `pedum' quod sint illa quae sunt naturalis hominis, de qua n. 2162; et 
a significatione `virorum qui cum illo' quod sint omnia quae ibi. Sollemne fuit quod viatores cum venirent in domum quandam, quod lavarent pedes; </p>
<p>          Ut cum fratres Josephi in domum Josephi introducerentur,  
    Gen. xliii 24; </p>
<p>          Cum Levita et qui cum illo in domum senis acciperentur,      Jud. xix 21; </p>
<p>          Et cum Uriah ab itinere veniens, juberetur a Davide      descendere 
in domum suam, et lavare pedes, 2 Sam. xi 8; </p>
<p>causa erat quia profectiones et peregrinationes significabant illa quae sunt instructionis, et inde vitae, videatur n. 1293, 1457, 1463, 2025, quae quod 
purificarentur, supra mox n. (x)3147 ostensum; et praeterea ne sordes {1}in spirituali sensu intellectae adhaererent, et inquinarent domum, hoc est, hominem; ut quoque patet ex illo,           Quod excuterent 
pulverem pedum, si urbs aut domus non      reciperet pacem, Matth. x 14. @1 illae$  </p>
