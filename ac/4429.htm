<h3 align="center" class="ired">属天的奥秘 第4429节</h3>
<h4 align="center"></h4><p><strong>4429.</strong>“要见那地的女子们”表要了解对真理的情感，和由这些情感所产生的诸教会。这从“见”、“女子（或女儿）”和“那地”的含义清楚可知：“见”是指了解，如前面频繁所述；“女子（或女儿）”是指情感和由此产生的教会（参看<a href="2362.htm">2362</a>，<a href="3024.htm">3024</a>，<a href="3963.htm">3963</a>节）；“那地”，就是此处的迦南地，是指教会所在的地区，因而也指教会本身（<a href="662.htm">662</a>，<a href="1066.htm">1066</a>，<a href="1067.htm">1067</a>，<a href="1262.htm">1262</a>，<a href="1733.htm">1733</a>，<a href="1850.htm">1850</a>，<a href="2117.htm">2117</a>，<a href="2118.htm">2118</a>，<a href="2928.htm">2928</a>，<a href="3355.htm">3355</a>，<a href="3686.htm">3686</a>，<a href="3705.htm">3705</a>节）。<br />从接下来的内容可以看出本节经文所包含的这些事的含义，因为所论述的主题是将要建立在雅各后代当中的教会代表。这代表无法在他们当中建立，除非他们在内层真理方面完全荒废，也就是不再拥有关于它们的任何知识（参看<a href="4289.htm">4289</a>节）。这些内层真理就是吩咐他们遵守的宗教仪式所代表并表示的所有那些真理；因为每项仪式都代表并表示主在天上国度中的某种事物，因而代表并表示主在地上的国度，也就是教会中的某种事物；它们所表示并代表的事物就是此处所说的内层真理。解释的章节处处都说明了这一事实：当教会的代表在雅各的后代当中建立时，吩咐他们遵守的一切事和每件事（这些事在摩西五经，尤其在出埃及记和利未记中有所描述）都是主国度的属天和属灵事物的代表和有意义的符号。这些属灵和属天事物都不为雅各的后代所知，因为这些后代具有这样的性质：他们若知道了，早就亵渎了（<a href="301.htm">301</a>-<a href="303.htm">303</a>，<a href="2520.htm">2520</a>，<a href="3398.htm">3398</a>，<a href="3479.htm">3479</a>，<a href="3769.htm">3769</a>，<a href="4281.htm">4281</a>，<a href="4293.htm">4293</a>节）。因此，他们不会进入这些代表，直到他们在内在事物上完全荒废。故本章的主题是这些真理和以色列对它们的灭绝。<br />吩咐雅各的后代所遵守的这些代表并不是新的，绝大部分是诸如以前古人所用的那类；只是古人不像雅各的后代，也就是犹太人和以色列人那样拜外在事物，而是拜内在事物，并通过内在事物承认主自己。来自古时的教会在迦南地，尤其在那些被称为赫人和希未人的人当中仍有余留；这就是为何这些民族代表这个教会的真理。从上述内容可在某种程度上明显看出底拿，就是利亚给雅各所生的女儿，出去见那地的女子是什么意思。因为“底拿”代表诸如建立在雅各后代当中的那种外在教会，而“那地的女子”表示古人当中的教会。就圣言的内义而言，“女子”（即女儿，daughter）处处表示教会，这在前面早已说明（<a href="2362.htm">2362</a>，<a href="3024.htm">3024</a>节）；“地”（即陆地，land）表示教会所在的地区和民族，因而表示教会（<a href="662.htm">662</a>，<a href="1066.htm">1066</a>，<a href="1067.htm">1067</a>，<a href="1733.htm">1733</a>，<a href="1850.htm">1850</a>，<a href="2117.htm">2117</a>，<a href="2118.htm">2118</a>，<a href="2928.htm">2928</a>，<a href="3355.htm">3355</a>，<a href="3686.htm">3686</a>，<a href="3705.htm">3705</a>节）。</p>

To see the daughters of the land. That this signifies to become acquainted with the affections of truth and the churches thence derived, is evident from the signification of "to see" as being to become 
acquainted with (of which several times before); from the signification of "daughters," as being affections and the churches thence derived (see n. 2362, 3024, 3963); and from the signification of 
"the land," here the land of Canaan, as being the region where the church is, and hence also the church itself (n. 662, 1066, 1067, 1262, 1733, 1850, 2117, 2118, 2928, 3355, 3705, 3686).  [2] The signification 
of the things contained in this verse may be seen from what follows, for the subject treated of is the representative of a church that was to be instituted among the descendants of Jacob. That 
this representative could not be instituted among them until they had been completely vastated in respect to interior truths - that is, until they no longer knew them - may be seen above (n. 4289). 
These interior truths are all those represented and signified by the rituals that were commanded them; for all the rituals represented and signified something in the Lord's kingdom in the heavens, and 
consequently something in the Lord's kingdom on earth, that is, in the church; and the things that were signified and represented are the interior truths here meant. That each and all of the things 
commanded the descendants of Jacob when the representative of a church was being instituted among them (as described in the books of Moses, especially in Exodus and Leviticus) were representative and 
significative of the celestial and spiritual things of the Lord's kingdom, has been everywhere shown in the explications. All these things were unknown to the descendants of Jacob, because these were 
of such a nature that if they had known them they would have profaned them (n. 301-303, 2520, 3398, 3479, 3769, 4281, 4293); and therefore they did not come into these representatives until they had 
been completely vastated in respect to their interiors; and therefore the truths in question and the extinguishing of them by the Israelites are described in this chapter. [3] The representatives that 
were commanded to the descendants of Jacob were not new, but for the most part were such as had previously been in use among the ancients; but the ancients did not worship the externals, as did the 
descendants of Jacob (that is, the Jews and Israelites), but they worshiped the internal things, and by means of these they acknowledged the Lord Himself. There were still remains in the land of Canaan 
of the church of ancient time, especially among those called Hittites and Hivites, and this is the reason why by these nations are represented the truths that had been of the church. From what has been 
said it may in some measure appear what is signified by Dinah, Jacob's daughter by Leah, going out to see the daughters of the land; for by Dinah is represented the external church, such as was instituted 
among the descendants of Jacob, and by the daughters of the land are signified the churches among the ancients. That in the internal sense of the Word "daughters" everywhere signify churches, 
has been shown above (n. 2362, 3024); and that the "land" signifies the region and nation where the church is, and thus the church (n. 662,1066, 1067, 1733, 1850, 2117, 2118, 2928, 3355, 3686, 3705). </p>

'To see the daughters of the land' means to get to know the affections for truth, and the Churches which arise from these. This is clear from the meaning of 'seeing' as getting to know, dealt with frequently 
already; from the meaning of 'the daughters' as affections, and consequently Churches, dealt with in <a href="2362.htm">2362</a>, <a href="3024.htm">3024</a>, <a href="3963.htm">3963</a>; and from the meaning of 'the land', in this case the land of Canaan, as 
that area where the Church is, and therefore also the Church itself, dealt with in <a href="662.htm">662</a>, <a href="1066.htm">1066</a>, <a href="1067.htm">1067</a>, <a href="1262.htm">1262</a>, <a href="1733.htm">1733</a>, <a href="1850.htm">1850</a>, <a href="2117.htm">2117</a>, <a href="2118.htm">2118</a>, <a href="2928.htm">2928</a>, <a href="3355.htm">3355</a>, <a href="3686.htm">3686</a>, <a href="3705.htm">3705</a>. </p>
<p></p>
<p><b>[2]</b>
 The meaning of these things contained in 
this verse becomes clear from those that follow, for the subject is the representative of the Church which was to be established among the descendants of Jacob This representative among them could not 
be established until they had undergone complete vastation so far as interior truths were concerned, that is, until they no longer had any knowledge of them; see <a href="4289.htm">4289</a>. Interior truths are all those 
which are represented and meant by the religious observances which they were commanded to keep; for every religious observance represented, and was a sign meaning, something in the Lord's kingdom in 
heaven, and consequently something in the Lord's kingdom on earth, that is, in the Church. The things which they meant and represented are in this instance interior truths. The fact that all the things, 
each one, which the descendants of Jacob were commanded to observe when a representative of the Church was established among them - which things are laid down in the books of Moses, especially in Exodus 
and Leviticus - were representatives and meaningful signs of the celestial and spiritual things of the Lord's kingdom has been shown throughout the explanatory sections. None of these spiritual 
and celestial things were known to the descendants of Jacob, for the character of those descendants was such that if they had known them they would have profaned them, <a href="301.htm">301</a>-<a href="303.htm">303</a>, <a href="2520.htm">2520</a>, <a href="3398.htm">3398</a>, <a href="3479.htm">3479</a>, <a href="3769.htm">3769</a>, <a href="4281.htm">4281</a>, <a href="4293.htm">4293</a>. For that reason they did not enter into those representatives until they had undergone complete vastation so far as interior things were concerned. The subject in this chapter therefore is 
those truths and that people's annihilation of them. </p>
<p></p>
<p><b>[3]</b>
 The representatives which the descendants of Jacob were commanded to observe were not new, the majority being like those that had been in 
use formerly among the Ancients. Unlike the descendants of Jacob however, that is, unlike the Jews and Israelites, the Ancients did not worship external things but internal ones. Through internal things 
they acknowledged the Lord Himself. Remnants of the Church from ancient times still existed in the land of Canaan, especially among those who were called Hittites and Hivites. This is why those nations 
represent the truths of the Church. From all this one may now have some idea of what is meant by Dinah, the daughter of Jacob by Leah, going out to see the daughters of the land. For 'Dinah' represents 
the external Church such as was established among the descendants of Jacob, while 'the daughters of the land' means Churches existing among the Ancients. Everywhere in the Word Churches are meant 
in its internal sense by 'daughters', see <a href="2362.htm">2362</a>, <a href="3024.htm">3024</a>, where this meaning has been shown; and 'land' means an area and a nation where the Church exists, and so means the Church, <a href="662.htm">662</a>, <a href="1066.htm">1066</a>, <a href="1067.htm">1067</a>, <a href="1733.htm">1733</a>,

`Ad videndum filias terrae': quod significet ad cognoscendum affectiones veri et Ecclesias quae sunt inde, constat ex significatione `videre' quod sit cognoscere, de qua aliquoties prius; ex significatione 
`filiarum' quod sint affectiones, et inde Ecclesiae, de qua n. 2362, 3024, 3963; et ex significatione `terrae,' hic terrae Canaanis, quod sit tractus ubi Ecclesia, et inde quoque ipsa Ecclesia, 
de qua n. 662, 1066, 1067, 1262, 1733, 1850, 2117, 2118, (x)2928, 3355, 3705, 3686.  [2] Quid per haec quae in hoc versu continentur, significatur, constare potest ab illis quae sequuntur, 
agitur enim de repraesentativo Ecclesiae quod apud posteros Jacobi instituendum erat; quod hoc repraesentativum apud illos non institui potuerit priusquam quoad interiora vera prorsus vastati fuissent, 
hoc est, priusquam non amplius scivissent illa, videatur n. 4289; interiora vera sunt omnia illa quae repraesentantur {1} et significantur per ritualia quae illis mandata fuerunt; omnia enim ritualia 
repraesentarunt et significarunt aliquid in regno Domini in caelis et inde aliquid in regno Domini in terris, (o)hoc est, in Ecclesia; haec quae significabantur et repraesentabantur, sunt hic 
interiora vera: quod omnia et singula quae mandata sunt posteris Jacobi, cum Ecclesiae repraesentativum apud illos institueretur, de quibus in libris Mosis, imprimis in Exodo et Levitico, fuerint 
repraesentativa et significativa caelestium et spiritualium regni Domini, ubivis in explicationibus ostensum est: haec omnia fuerunt posteris Jacobi ignota, quia tales fuerunt ut illa profanavissent 
si novissent, D. 301-303, 2520, 3398, 3479, 3769, 4281, 4293; idcirco non prius venerunt in repraesentativa illa {2}, quam cum prorsus quoad interiora vastati fuissent: in hoc capite itaque agitur 
de illis veris et quod exstinxerint illa.  [3] Repraesentativa quae mandata fuerunt posteris Jacobi, non fuerunt nova, sed pleraque talia quae prius in usu apud antiquos; verum {3} antiqui non 
coluerunt externa, sicut posteri Jacobi, seu Judaei et Israelitae, sed interna; per interna agnoverunt Ipsum Dominum; reliquiae Ecclesiae ab antiquo {4} adhuc fuerunt in terra Canaane; imprimis apud 
illos qui Hittaei et Hivaei dicebantur; inde est quod per illas gentes repraesententur vera quae fuerunt Ecclesiae {5}; ex his nunc aliquatenus constare potest quid significatur per quod `exiverit Dinah 
filia Jacobi ex Leah {6}, ad videndum filias terrae'; per `Dinam' enim repraesentatur Ecclesia externa qualis institueretur apud posteros Jacobi; et per `filias terrae' significantur Ecclesiae 
apud antiquos; quod `filiae' ubivis in Verbo in sensu ejus interno significant Ecclesias, videatur n. 2362, 3024 ubi id ostensum; et quod `terra' tractum et gentem ubi Ecclesia, ita Ecclesiam,
