<h3 align="center" class="ired">属天的奥秘 第4946节</h3>
<h4 align="center"></h4><p><strong>4946.</strong>一些灵人活在肉身时吸收了这种观念：人不必关心那些涉及内在人的事物，因而不必关心属灵事物，只关心那些涉及外在人或属世人的事物就可以了。他们之所以这样想，是因为更内在性质的事物妨碍了他们生活的快乐，造成不适。他们作用于我的左膝，前面略高于膝的地方，还作用于我的右脚底。我在他们所居之地与他们交谈；<br />他们说，他们活在肉身时所持的观点是：只有外在事物是活的，他们不明白何为内在事物。所以，他们只知道属世之物，不知道何为属灵之物。于是，我蒙允许告诉他们说，他们已经通过这种思维方式把若他们承认内层事物，因而允许它们进入其思维观念，就能从灵界流入的无数事物拒之门外。<br />我还蒙允许告诉他们说，人的每一个思维观念中都有无数事物；这些事物在人，尤其属世人看来，无非是一个简单的整体；而事实上，其中有无限事物从灵界流入，并在属灵人里面产生卓越的视觉能力，他凭这视觉能力能看到并发觉某事物是否是真理。而且，由于这些灵人怀疑他们所听到的，所以这事便通过活生生的经历向他们说明了。一个观点被呈现给他们，他们将这个观念仅仅看作一个简单的整体，因而看作一个模糊的点（像这样的代表在天堂之光中很容易被产生）。当这个观念被打开，同时他们的内视也被打开时，一个通向主的整体就显现出来了。他们还被告知，良善与真理的每一个观念都是这种情况；也就是说，它是整个天堂的一个形象，因为它来自主，而主是天堂的全部，或被称为天堂的本质真实。</p>

There are some who in the life of the body have become imbued with the idea that man ought not to be concerned about those things which are of the internal man, thus about spiritual things, but only 
about those which are of the external man, or that are natural, for the reason that interior things disturb the delights of their life, and produce discomfort. They acted upon the left knee, and a little 
above the knee in front, and also upon the sole of the right foot. I conversed with them in their place of abode; and they said that they had been of opinion in the life of the body that only external 
things are living, and that they did not understand what internal things are, consequently that they knew what is natural, but not what the spiritual is. But it was given me to tell them that by 
this means they had shut out from themselves innumerable things which might have flowed in from the spiritual world if they had acknowledged interior things, and thus had admitted them into the ideas 
of their thought. And it was also given to tell them that in every idea of thought there are innumerable things which to man, especially the natural man, appear merely as a single uncompounded thing; 
when yet there are indefinite things in it which flow in from the spiritual world, and in a spiritual man produce superior insight, by which he can see and also perceive whether anything is true or not. 
And because they were in doubt in regard to this, it was shown them by living experience. There was represented to them a single idea, which they saw as one simple idea, and thus as an obscure point 
(by a mode of representation very easy in the light of heaven); but when that idea was unfolded, and at the same time their interior sight opened, there was then manifested as it were a universe leading 
to the Lord; and it was said that so it is with every idea of good and truth, namely, that it is an image of the whole heaven, because it is from the Lord, who is the all of heaven, or that itself 
which is called heaven. </p>

Certain spirits exist who during their lifetime absorbed the idea that no one should bother himself with matters that concern the internal man, consequently with spiritual things, only with matters that 
concern the external man, that is, with natural things. Their reason for thinking this way is that things of a more internal nature unsettle their comfortable lifestyle and create discomfort. Those 
spirits were acting into my left knee, a little above the front of it, and also into the sole of my right foot. I talked to them in their dwelling-place. They said that during their lifetime they had 
imagined that none but external interests had held any life in them and that they had had no idea of what anything internal was. Consequently they had been acquainted with natural things but with nothing 
spiritual. So I was allowed to tell them that thinking the way they did they had shut out from themselves countless things which could have come in from the spiritual world, had they acknowledged 
and so allowed these to enter among the ideas constituting their thought. </p>
<p></p>
<p><b>[2]</b>
 I was allowed to go on and tell them that each idea present in human thought has countless facets which to the human 
being, especially to one who is natural, are not seen as anything else than a simple whole, when in fact there is an unlimited number of things coming in from the spiritual world which produce in the 
spiritual man a superior power of sight enabling him to see and also perceive whether something is indeed the truth or not the truth. Also, because these spirits doubted what they were told, the matter 
was demonstrated to them through actual experience. An idea was represented to them which they saw as a simple whole, and therefore as a faint dot - a representation such as this being produced easily 
in the light of heaven. When that idea was opened up and at the same time their interior sight was opened, a general whole leading to the Lord was revealed. They were also told that the same was the 
case with every idea of good and truth; that is to say, it is an image of the whole of heaven, because it comes from the Lord, who is the All of heaven or the essential reality that is called heaven. </p>

</p><b>4946.</b>
Sunt quidam qui in vita corporis imbuerunt quod homo non curare debeat illa quae interni hominis sunt, proinde spiritualia, sed solum quae externi hominis sunt seu naturalia, ex causa quod interiora 
perturbent jucunda vitae eorum, ac faciant injucundum; </p>
<p>agebant illi in sinistrum genu et paulum supra genu, ab anteriore, et quoque in plantam pedis dextri; locutus sum cum illis in mansione eorum; 
dicebant quod putaverint in vita corporis solum externa vivere, et quod non intellexerint quid (o)esset internum, proinde quod naturalia sciverint, non autem quid spirituale; sed dicere illis 
datum quod innumerabilia per id sibi praecluserint, quae ex spirituali mundo potuissent influere, si interiora agnoverint, et sic in cogitationis suae ideas admiserint; [2] et porro dicere datum quod 
in unaquavis cogitationis idea innumerabilia sint quae coram homine imprimis naturali, non apparent nisi sicut unum simplex, cum tamen indefinita sunt quae ex mundo spirituali influunt, quae faciunt 
apud hominem spiritualem, intuitionem superiorem ex qua videre et quoque percipere potest, num verum sit vel non verum et quia dubitabant de (c)eo, ostendebatur id per vivam experientiam; repraesentabatur 
illis una idea quam videbant ut unam simplicem, proinde sicut punctum obscurum, tale in luce caeli facile repraesentatur; illa idea cum recluderetur, et simul visus eorum interior aperiretur, 
tunc patuit sicut universum ad Dominum ducens, et dictum quod ita sit in unaquavis idea boni et veri, quod nempe sit imago totius caeli quia est a Domino, Qui est omne caeli, seu ipsum illud 
quod vocatur caelum. </p>
