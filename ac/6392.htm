<h3 align="center" class="ired">属天的奥秘 第6392节</h3>
<h4 align="center"></h4><p><strong>6392.</strong>“以地为可喜悦”表那些在主国度的人就享有这种幸福。这从“地”和“可喜悦”的含义清楚可知：“地”是指教会，因而也指主的国度（<a href="662.htm">662</a>，<a href="1066.htm">1066</a>，<a href="1067.htm">1067</a>，<a href="1413.htm">1413</a>，<a href="1607.htm">1607</a>，<a href="1733.htm">1733</a>，<a href="1850.htm">1850</a>，<a href="2117.htm">2117</a>，<a href="2118.htm">2118</a>，<a href="4447.htm">4447</a>节），“地”之所以具有这种含义，是因为在圣言中，“地”所表示的迦南地代表主的国度，它代表主的国度，是因为教会自上古时代起就一直在那里（<a href="3038.htm">3038</a>，<a href="3481.htm">3481</a>，<a href="3686.htm">3686</a>，<a href="3705.htm">3705</a>，<a href="4447.htm">4447</a>，<a href="4454.htm">4454</a>，<a href="4516.htm">4516</a>，<a href="4517.htm">4517</a>，<a href="5136.htm">5136</a>节）；“可喜悦”是指不思回报的善行所具有的幸福。经上之所以说“他看安息为美好，以地为可喜悦”，并且这两种说法都表示存在于主国度中的幸福，是因为“看安息为美好”论及属天之物或良善，而“以地为可喜悦”论及属灵之物或真理，这两种说法都提及是由于良善与真理的婚姻（<a href="6343.htm">6343</a>节）。<br />进一步考虑存在于不思回报的善行中的幸福，要知道，如今很少有人知道不思回报而行善就是天上的幸福。因为除了升职，被别人服侍，有大量财富，过一种享乐的生活外，人们不知道还有其它什么幸福可言。还有超越这些东西、充满人之内层的幸福存在，因而有一种天堂的幸福存在，这幸福就是真正仁爱的幸福；对此，他们极度无知。问问当今智者，他们知不知道这就是天堂的幸福。这也解释了为何许多人弃绝善行，以为行善却没有通过行善赚取功德的意图对任何人来说，都是不可能的。因为他们不知道那些被主引导的人只渴望行善，压根就没有通过行善赚取功德的想法。主赐给那些正在重生之人的新意愿就带有这种心态；因为这新意愿就是住在人里面的主。</p>

<p align="center"><b>Potts(1905-1910) 6392</b></p><p><b>6392.</b>
And the land that it is pleasant. That this signifies that in this happiness are they who are in the Lord's kingdom, is evident from the signification of "land," as being the church, thus also the Lord's 
kingdom (n. 662, 1066, 1067, 1413, 1607, 1733, 1850, 2117, 2118, 4447); that the "land" has this signification is because the land of Canaan, which is meant by the "land" in the Word, represented 
the Lord's kingdom, and this because the church had been there from the most ancient time (n. 3038, 3481, 3686, 3705, 4447, 4454, 4516, 4517, 5136); and from the signification of "that it was pleasant," 
which signifies the happiness that is in works of good without reward. It is said that "he shall see rest that it is good, and the land that it is pleasant," and by both expressions is signified the 
happiness which is in the Lord's kingdom, because "to see rest that it is good," refers to what is celestial or to good, and "to see the land that it is pleasant," refers to what is spiritual or to 
truth, and this on account of the marriage of good and truth (n. 6343). As to what further concerns happiness in works of good without reward, be it known that very few at this day know that in doing 
goods without the end of reward is heavenly happiness; for they do not know that there is any other happiness than in being advanced to honors, in being served by others, in abounding in riches, and 
in living in pleasures. That above these things there is a happiness which affects the interiors of man, thus that there is a heavenly happiness, and that this happiness is the happiness of genuine charity, 
they are deeply ignorant. Inquire of the wise of this day whether they know that this is heavenly happiness. From this also it is that many reject good works, believing that no one can do them 
without regard to self-merit; for they do not know that they who are led by the Lord desire nothing more than to do good works, and that they think of nothing less than of meriting by them. This is in 
the new will, which is given by the Lord to those who are being regenerated, for this will is the will of the Lord in the man. </p>

<p align="center"><b>Elliott(1983-1999) 6392</b></p><p><b>6392.</b>
'And the land that it is pleasant' means that those in the Lord's kingdom enjoy that happiness. This is clear from the meaning of 'the land' as the Church, thus also the Lord's kingdom, dealt with in <a href="662.htm">662</a>, <a href="1066.htm">1066</a>, <a href="1067.htm">1067</a>, <a href="1413.htm">1413</a>, <a href="1607.htm">1607</a>, <a href="1733.htm">1733</a>, <a href="1850.htm">1850</a>, <a href="2117.htm">2117</a>, <a href="2118.htm">2118</a>, <a href="4447.htm">4447</a> (the reason why 'the land' has this meaning is that the land of Canaan, to which 'the land' refers in the Word, represented the Lord's kingdom; 
and it had this representation because the Church had existed there since the most ancient times, <a href="3038.htm">3038</a>, <a href="3481.htm">3481</a>, <a href="3686.htm">3686</a>, <a href="3705.htm">3705</a>, <a href="4447.htm">4447</a>, <a href="4454.htm">4454</a>, <a href="4516.htm">4516</a>, <a href="4517.htm">4517</a>, <a href="5136.htm">5136</a>); and from the meaning of 'that it is pleasant' 
as the happiness which works of goodness without thought of recompense entail. The reason why it says 'he will see rest that it is good, and the land that it is pleasant', by both of which statements 
is meant the happiness that exists in the Lord's kingdom, is that 'seeing rest that it is good' has reference to what is celestial or to good, while 'seeing the land that it is pleasant 'has reference 
to what is spiritual or to truth, both of which are mentioned on account of the marriage of goodness and truth, spoken of in <a href="6343.htm">6343</a>. </p>
<p></p>
<p><b>[2]</b>
 To take further this matter of the happiness that exists in 
the works of goodness without thought of recompense, it should be recognized that very few at the present day know that performing good deeds without thought of recompense is that in which heavenly happiness 
consists. For people know of no other happiness than that gained from being raised to important positions, being served by others, having an abundance of riches, and leading a life of pleasure. 
They are profoundly ignorant of the existence above all these things of a happiness that fills a person's inner being, thus of the existence of a heavenly happiness, or of the fact that this happiness 
is the happiness that genuine charity possesses. Ask the wise at the present day whether they know that this is heavenly happiness. This also explains why many disallow good works, in the belief that 
it is impossible for anyone to perform them without the intention to earn merit through them. For they do not know that those who are led by the Lord have no greater desire than to perform good works, 
and that nothing is further from their thought than the earning of merit through them. The new will which the Lord confers on those who are being regenerated brings this attitude of mind with it; 
for this new will is the Lord's residing with a person. </p>

`Et terram quod amoena': quod significet quod in illa, nempe felicitate sint, qui in regno Domini, constat a significatione `terrae' quod sit Ecclesia, ac ita quoque regnum Domini, de qua n. 662, 1066, 
1067, 1413, 1607, 1733, 1850, 2117, 2118, 4447; quod `terra' id sit, est quia terra Canaan quae per terram intelligitur in Verbo, repraesentaverit regnum Domini, et hoc quia Ecclesia ibi fuerat ab 
antiquissimo tempore, n. 3038, 3481, 3686, 3705, 4447, 4454, 4516, 4517, 5136; et ex significatione `quod amoena' quod significet felicitatem quae operibus boni absque remuneratione.  Quod dicatur quod 
`videbit quietem quod bona, et terram quod amoena', et per utrumque significetur felicitas quae in regno Domini, est quia `videre quietem quod bona' se referat ad caeleste seu bonum, et `videre terram 
quod amoena' se referat ad spirituale seu verum, et hoc ob conjugium boni et veri, de quo n. 6343.  [2] Quod felicitatem {1}in operibus boni absque remuneratione ulterius concernit, sciendum quod 
paucissimi hodie sciant quod in faciendis bonis absque fine remunerationis sit felicitas caelestis; non enim sciunt quod alia felicitas sit quam evehi ad honores, serviri ab aliis, {2}divitiis abundare, 
in voluptatibus vivere; quod supra illa sit felicitas quae afficit interiora hominis, alte ignorant, ita {3}quod sit felicitas caelestis, et quod {4}haec felicitas sit felicitas genuinae charitatis'; 
quaere sapientes hodie num sciant quod id sit felicitas caelestis; inde quoque est quod plures rejiciant bona opera, credentes quod non dari queant apud aliquem {5}absque fine merendi per illa; nam 
non sciunt quod qui (x)ducuntur a Domino, {6}nihil potius velint quam bona opera facere, et quod nihil minus cogitent quam de merito per illa'; novae enim voluntati quae a Domino donatur illis qui regenerantur, 
hoc inest {7}, nam illa voluntas est Domini apud hominem. @1 ex$ @2 ditescere$ @3 quid$ @4 illa sit felicitas ex genuina charitate$ @5 nisi$ @6 nihil minus per bona quae faciunt, quam
