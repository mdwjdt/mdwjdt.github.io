<h3 align="center" class="ired">属天的奥秘 第7493节</h3>
<h4 align="center"></h4><p><strong>7493.</strong>当一个人到了自主决定和自我管理的年龄时，他里面的自我之爱和尘世之爱就开始掌权；因为那时，他开始出于他自己或他自己的东西思考，开始将这些邪恶变成他自己的；他越是这样做，就越坚定地在生活中接受邪恶。人在何等程度上将邪恶变成他自己的，主就在何等程度上将他在婴幼儿和童年时期，以及此后不时所接受的纯真和仁爱的良善分开，将它们存储在他的内层。因为纯真的良善和仁爱的良善决不能与这些爱的邪恶共存，主不愿让它们灭亡。</p>

<p align="center"><b>Potts(1905-1910) 7493</b></p><p><b>7493.</b>
The loves of self and of the world with man begin to reign when he comes to years of discretion and self-government; for then the man begins to think from himself or from his own, and to appropriate 
these loves to himself, and this the more as he confirms himself in a life of evil. Insofar as a man appropriates evils to himself, so far the Lord separates the good of innocence and charity which the 
man has received in infancy and childhood and at times afterward, and stores them up in his interiors; for the good of innocence and the good of charity can in no wise abide with the evils of these 
loves; and the Lord is not willing that they should perish. </p>

<p align="center"><b>Elliott(1983-1999) 7493</b></p><p><b>7493.</b>
The self-love and love of the world within a person start to reign when he comes to make his own decisions and to be responsible for his own actions; for then he starts to think from himself or what 
is his own, and starts to make those [evils] his own, which he does increasingly the more firmly he embraces evil in his life. To the extent that a person makes evils his own the Lord sets apart the good 
of innocence and of charity which he has received in infancy and childhood and receives from time to time after that, and He stores them away interiorly within the person. For the good of innocence 
and the good of charity cannot by any means exist together with the evils that are products of those loves, and the Lord is unwilling to let them be destroyed. </p>

<p align="center"><b>Latin(1748-1756) 7493</b>
</p><b>7493.</b>
Amores sui et mundi apud hominem incipiunt regnare quando is sui judicii et sui juris fit; tunc enim incipit homo ex se seu ex suo cogitare, et tunc incipit appropriare illa sibi; et hoc quo plus se 
confirmat quoad vitam in malo.  Quantum homo appropriat sibi mala, tantum Dominus separat bonum innocentiae et charitatis quod homo in infantia et pueritia accepit, et postea per vices accipit; ac illa 
recondit in interioribus ejus; nam bonum innocentiae et bonum charitatis nullatenus una possunt esse cum malis amorum illorum; et Dominus non vult ut pereant. </p>
