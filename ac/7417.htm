<h3 align="center" class="ired">属天的奥秘 第7417节</h3>
<h4 align="center"></h4><p><strong>7417.</strong>“伸出你的杖”表吩咐他展示神性能力。这从“伸出”和“杖”的含义清楚可知：“伸出”是指行使并展示，如前所述：“杖”是指能力（参看<a href="4013.htm">4013</a>，<a href="4015.htm">4015</a>，<a href="4876.htm">4876</a>，<a href="4936.htm">4936</a>，<a href="6947.htm">6947</a>，<a href="7011.htm">7011</a>，<a href="7026.htm">7026</a>节）。这种能力是神的，因为亚伦根本没有能力，杖更不蕴含任何能力。相反，是能力通过亚伦和他的杖来行使。能力通过杖来行使，是因为在教会中，神性所吩咐的事通过代表（这是在主降世之前），因而通过伸出手和杖来实现；事实上，臂和手对应于能力，杖由此也对应于能力。在教会中，在主降世之前，神性所吩咐的事之所以通过代表来实现，是因为祂所吩咐的每一件事都代表主，祂在天上的国度，以及在地上的国度，也就是教会。这一事实从圣言也可以看出来，圣言中的每一个事物在至高意义上都论述主，在内义上则论述主的国度和教会。</p>

Stretch out thy rod. That this signifies that he should show Divine power, is evident from the signification "to stretch out," as being to exercise and to show (as above); and from the signification 
of a "rod," as being power (see n. 4013, 4015, 4876, 4936, 6947, 7011, 7026); which power was Divine because Aaron had no power, still less was there power in the rod; but the power was exercised through 
Aaron and his rod. That it was exercised through the rod was because the things done by Divine command within the church were done by means of representatives (this was before the Lord's Coming), 
thus by the stretching out of the hand and of the rod; because the arm and the hand correspond to power, and from this also the rod. The reason why before the Coming of the Lord the things done within 
the church by Divine command were done by means of representatives, was that all things and each represented the Lord and His kingdom in the heavens, and His kingdom on earth, that is, the church. That 
this is so can also be seen from the Word, in which all things and each in the supreme sense treat of the Lord, and in the internal sense treat of His kingdom and church. </p>

<p align="center"><b>Elliott(1983-1999) 7417</b></p><p><b>7417.</b>
'Stretch out your rod' means commanding him to demonstrate the Divine power. This is clear from the meaning of 'stretching out' as exercising and demonstrating, as previously; and from the meaning of 
'the rod' as power, dealt with in <a href="4017.htm">4017</a>, <a href="4015.htm">4015</a>, <a href="4876.htm">4876</a>, <a href="4936.htm">4936</a>, <a href="6947.htm">6947</a>, <a href="7011.htm">7011</a>, <a href="7026.htm">7026</a>. This power was Divine, because Aaron had no power at all; still less did the rod contain any. Rather Aaron and his rod were 
the instruments by means of which power was exercised. It was exercised by means of a rod because, within the Church, what the Divine commanded to be done was accomplished through representatives (This 
was before the Lord's Coming.) So it was that the stretching out of hand and rod accomplished what was commanded, for arm and hand correspond to power, and so too consequently does a rod. The reason 
why within the Church, before the Lord's Coming, what the Divine commanded was accomplished through representatives was that every single thing commanded by Him represented the Lord, His kingdom in 
heaven, and His kingdom on earth, which is the Church. The truth of this may also be recognized from the Word in which every single thing has to do in the highest sense with the Lord, and in the internal 
sense with His kingdom and Church.  </p>

</p><b>7417.</b>
`Extende baculum tuum': quod significet ut ostenderet potentiam Divinam, constat ex significatione `extendere' quod sit exercere et ostendere, ut prius; et ex significatione `baculi' quod sit potentia, 
de qua n. 4013, 4015, 4876, 4936, 6947, 7011, 7026; quae potentia Divina {1}fuit, quia Aharoni nihil potentiae fuit, minus in baculo, sed potentia per Aharonem et ejus baculum exercebatur; {2}quod 
per baculum exerceretur, erat causa quia quae intra Ecclesiam ex mandato Divino fiebant, per repraesentativa fiebant; hoc ante Adventum Domini; ita per extensionem {3}manus et baculi, quia brachium et 
manus correspondent potentiae, et inde quoque baculus.  Causa quod ante Adventum Domini illa quae intra Ecclesiam ex mandato Divino fiebant per repraesentativa fierent erat quia omnia et singula repraesentabant 
Dominum, ac Ipsius regnum in caelis, et regnum in terris seu Ecclesiam; quod ita sit, etiam constare potest ex Verbo, in quo omnia et singula in supremo sensu agunt de Domino, et in sensu 
interno de Ipsius regno et Ecclesia. 	@1 dicitur$ 	@2 ex causa quia tempore ante adventum Domini$ 	@3 baculi ac manus$ </p>
