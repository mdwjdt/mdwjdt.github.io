<h3 align="center" class="ired">属天的奥秘 第3288节</h3>
<h4 align="center"></h4><p><strong>3288.</strong>“他的妻子利百加就怀了孕”表来自为母亲的神性真理。这从“利百加”的代表和“怀孕”的含义清楚可知：“利百加”是指理性的神性真理，如前一章所述；“怀孕”是指神圣属世人的初始，如同来自一位母亲。因为如刚才所述，神圣属世人源于为父亲的理性神性良善和为母亲的理性神性真理。这一真相几乎不为人所知，并且这种无知由于很少有人知道理性人不同于属世人而更大。因为只有那些具有真正理性的人才知道这种不同，而除了那些被主重生的人外，没有人具有真正的理性。凡未重生的人都不理解这种不同，因为在他们看来，理性人和属世人是一回事。</p>

And Rebekah his woman conceived. That this signifies from Divine truth as from a mother, is evident from the representation of Rebekah, as being the Divine truth of the rational, treated of in the preceding 
chapter; and from the signification of "conceiving," as being the first beginning of the Divine natural as from a mother; for, as just said, the Divine natural had its origin from the Divine good 
of the rational as a father, and from the Divine truth of the rational as a mother. That this is the case is known to scarcely anyone, and this ignorance is the greater because few are aware that 
the rational is distinct from the natural; for only those know this who are truly rational, and they alone are truly rational who have been regenerated by the Lord; whereas they who have not been regenerated 
do not comprehend this, for to them the rational is the same as the natural. </p>

'And Rebekah his wife conceived' means from Divine Truth as the mother. This is clear from the representation of 'Rebekah' as the Divine Truth of the Rational, dealt with in the previous chapter, and 
from the meaning of 'conceiving' as the first beginnings of the rise of the Divine Natural, as from the mother. For as stated just above, the Divine Natural came into being from the Divine Good of the 
Rational as father and from the Divine Truth of the Rational as mother. Scarcely anybody knows that this is so, especially since few know that the rational is distinct and separate from the natural. 
None but those who are truly rational know of that distinctness, and none are truly rational but those who have been regenerated by the Lord. People who have not been regenerated do not grasp it since 
to them the rational and the natural are one and the same. </p>

</p><b>3288.</b>
Quod `concepit Rebecca mulier ejus' significet quod ex Divino Vero ut a matre, constat ex repraesentatione `Rebeccae' quod sit Divinum Verum Rationalis, de qua in capite praecedente; et a significatione 
`concipere' quod sit primum ortus Divini Naturalis ut a matre; nam, ut mox supra dictum est', Divinum Naturale ortum est a Divino Bono Rationalis, ut a patre, et a Divino Vero Rationalis, ut a matre: 
quod ita sit, vix {1}aliquis novit, et hoc eo minus quia pauci sciunt quod rationale (t)distinctum sit a naturali, nec alii sciunt hoc quam qui vere rationales sunt, nec vere rationales sunt alii 
quam qui regenerati sunt a Domino; qui non regenerati sunt, non capiunt {2}hoc, nam illis rationale est idem ac naturale. @1 i adhuc$  @2 aliud quam quod rationale sit$  </p>
