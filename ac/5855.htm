<h3 align="center" class="ired">属天的奥秘 第5855节</h3>
<h4 align="center"></h4><p><strong>5855.</strong>在与灵人对话这条路向我打开之前，我一直认为没有哪个灵人或天使能知道或察觉我的思维，因为这些思维在我里面，只有神知道。然后有一天发生了一件事；我发现一个灵人知道我在想什么，因为他同我聊了几句关于我正在思想的事，并用一种符号表明他在场。我因此，尤其因以下事实而目瞪口呆：他知道我的想法。由此明显可知，让一个人相信一个灵人能知道他在想什么是何等困难；而事实上，一个灵人不仅能知道此人自己所知道的想法，还能知道他所不知道的思维和情感的最小细节。灵人甚至知道此人活在肉身期间永远不可能知道的事。这一事实是我从多年来的不断经历得知的。</p>

Before the way was opened to me to speak with spirits, I was of the opinion that no spirit or angel could ever know or perceive my thoughts, because they were within me, and known to God alone. And then 
it once happened that I observed that a certain spirit knew what I was thinking, for he spoke with me about what I was thinking of, in a few words, and gave an indication of his presence by a certain 
sign. At this I was astounded, chiefly because he knew my thoughts. From this it was evident how difficult it is for a man to believe that any spirit knows what he is thinking, when yet he knows not 
only the thoughts which the man himself knows, but also the least things of his thoughts and affections, which the man does not know-nay, such things as the man can never know during the life of the 
body. This I know from the continuous experience of many years. </p>

Before the way was opened that enabled me to talk to spirits I had been of the opinion that no one except God alone - no spirit or any angel - could possibly know and perceive my thoughts since they 
were within me. Then one day something happened; I noticed that a certain spirit knew what I was thinking, for he spoke a few words to me about the things I was thinking, and he used a certain sign to 
indicate his presence. I was dumbfounded by this, above all by the fact that he knew my thoughts. The experience proved to me how difficult it is for a person to believe that a spirit can know what he 
is thinking, when in fact a spirit can know not only the thoughts of which a person himself is aware but also the smallest details of the thoughts and affections of which a person is not aware. Indeed 
the spirit can know things the person can never be aware of during his lifetime. This is something I know about from experience which has gone on for a number of years. </p>

</p><b>5855.</b>
Antequam apertum mihi fuit ut loquerer cum spiritibus, in opinione fui quod nusquam aliquis spiritus, nec angelus, scire et percipere potuisset meas cogitationes, quia intra me, praeter quod solus {1}Deus; 
semel tunc contigit quod animadverterem quod spiritus quidam sciret quid cogitarem, nam loquebatur mecum de illis, paucis verbis, et indicium dedit praesentiae per quoddam signum; quo obstupefactus, 
praecipue quod sciret mea cogitata; inde constabat quam difficile sit homini credere quod aliquis spiritus sciat quid cogitat, cum tamen non solum scit cogitata quae ipse homo, sed etiam minima 
cogitationum et affectionum, quae non homo, immo talia quae nusquam in vita corporis {2} scire potest; hoc ex continua plurium annorum experientia scio. @1 Dominus$ @2 i homo$ </p>
