<h3 align="center" class="ired">属天的奥秘 第4622节</h3>
<h4 align="center"></h4><p><h4 align="center">关于与大人的对应（续）</h4><br />此处关于气味和鼻孔与大人的对应关系<br />【节】4622.在来世，蒙福者的居所多种多样，各不相同，并且被建造得如此优雅，以至于可以说是建筑艺术本身的化身，或该艺术的直接产物（关于该主题，可参看前面所描述的经历，<a href="1119.htm">1119</a>，<a href="1626.htm">1626</a>-<a href="1630.htm">1630</a>节）。这些居所不仅通过视觉，还通过触觉显现给蒙福的人；在来世，一切事物都适合灵人和天使所拥有的感觉能力。因此，他们的居所具有的性质与世人用肉体感官所感知到的物体不一样，而是与来世之人的感官所感知到的物体一样。我意识到，这对许多人来说难以置信；因为他们不相信任何无法用肉眼看见，或用肉手摸到的事物。因此，今天的人因其内层关闭，故对存在于灵界或天堂中的事物一无所知。诚然，他出于圣言和教义会说，有一个天堂，那里的天使都生活在喜乐和荣耀中；但除此之外，他什么也不知道。他的确想知道那里是什么样子，但当被告知时，他还是什么也不信，因为他发自内心否认这类事物的存在。他想知道的原因无非出于唯独由教义所引发的好奇心，而非出于基于真正信仰的任何快乐。那些没有任何真正信仰的人也发自内心否认；而那些拥有这种信仰的人则从各种源头获得关于天堂及其喜乐和荣耀的观念。人人都能凭他所获得的任何知识和理解这样做，即使简单人也能凭他们通过身体感官所感觉到的事物如此行。<br />即便如此，大多数人并不清楚以下观念：灵人和天使所享有的感觉远远比世人的敏锐得多；也就是说，他们拥有视觉、听觉和嗅觉，以及某种类似于味觉和触觉的事物，尤其拥有属于情感的快乐。如果人真的相信他们的内在本质是灵，肉体及其感官和肢体仅适合在这个世上使用；而灵及其感官和肢体适合在来世使用，他们无需帮助，几乎自动进入关于死后其灵之状态的观念。因为在这种情况下，他们会反思，灵必是那个能思考、有欲求、有渴望、有感情的真正的人自己；并进一步反思，出现在肉体中的一切感觉能力属于灵，仅通过由此而来的流注而属于身体。以后他们还会通过许多考虑和其它证据确认这个观念，以这种方式最终更以他们灵的能力为快乐，而不是以他们肉体的能力为快乐。<br />关于这个问题，还需要说的是：并不是人的肉体在看、听、嗅、通过触摸感觉，而是人的灵。正因如此，当灵离开身体时，它仍保留自己的感觉能力，和在肉体中时一样。事实上，现在这些感觉要敏锐得多。因为属于肉体的事物相对于属于灵的事物更粗糙，故钝化了这些感觉能力；这些感觉能力甚至变得更迟钝，因为这人将它们浸没于地上和世俗事物中。我可以非常肯定地说，灵所拥有的视觉和听觉远远比人在肉体中所拥有的敏锐得多。说来令人吃惊，灵也拥有嗅觉，尤其拥有触觉。因为灵人能看到彼此，听到彼此，摸到彼此。此外，凡相信死后生命的人也能从以下事实推论出这一点：没有感觉，就不可能有生命；生命的确切性质取决于感觉的性质。事实上，他会推论出，理解力无非是对内在事物的一种更敏锐的感官觉知，而更高级、更优越的理解力是对属灵事物的感官觉知。这也解释了为何理解力及其对事物的觉知被称为内在感觉。<br />就刚死后人的感觉能力而言，情况是这样：一旦人死亡，其身体的各个部位变得冷，他就被提升进入生命，同时进入一种包含所有感觉能力 的状态。一开始，他几乎没有意识到他已不在肉体中，因为那时，他所享有的感觉使他有如此想法。但当他发现，他的感觉能力比以前更敏锐了，尤其他开始与其他灵人交谈时，便意识到他在来世，其身体的死亡是其灵生命的延续。我曾与我的两个熟人交谈过，就在他们被埋葬的那一天；其中一位通过我的眼睛看到自己的棺材和棺材架。由于这个人享有他在世上所拥有的一切感觉，所以他和我谈论他的葬礼，而我就在给他送葬的队伍当中。关于他的肉体，他说，他们应该把它扔掉，因为他本人还活着。<br />然而，要知道，那些在来世的人若不通过某个世人的眼睛，就无法看到世上的任何事物。他们之所以能通过我的眼睛看到，是因为我既在灵里与他们在一起，同时也在肉体中与那些在世上的人在一起（参看<a href="1880.htm">1880</a>节）。还要知道，我看那些在来世与我交谈的人用的是我的灵眼，而不是我的肉眼。我看他们看得很清楚，有时比用肉眼看得还要清楚；因为蒙主的神性怜悯，我灵的感官被打开了。<br />不过，我意识到，那些唯独沉浸于肉体、地上和世俗事物的人，也就是那些以这类事物为其目的的人，不会相信目前我所说的话。因为这种人除了因死亡而消散的事物外，对任何事物都没有概念。我还意识到，那些对灵魂进行大量思考和调查，同时却不明白人的灵魂就是他的灵，他的灵就是活在肉体中的这个人自己之人也不会相信我说的这些话。因为这些人对灵魂没有其它概念，只是认为它是某种像思维，或火焰，或以太的东西，唯独进入肉体的器官形式运作，而不进入那些属于肉体中的灵的更纯粹形式运作；因而认为灵魂是诸如必与肉体一起消散的那种事物。那些因误以为自己比谁都更有智慧、从而夸大自己形像而确信此类观念的人尤其不相信。</p>

CONTINUATION CONCERNING CORRESPONDENCE WITH THE GRAND MAN, HERE CONCERNING THE CORRESPONDENCE OF ODOR AND OF THE NOSTRILS THEREWITH. The dwellings of the blessed in the other life are of many kinds, 
and are constructed with such art as to be as it were embodiments of the very art of architecture, or to come straight from the art itself. (On this subject see what has already been related from experience, 
n. 1116, 1626-1630.) These dwellings appear not only to the sight, but also to the touch, for all things there are adapted to the sensations of spirits and angels, and hence are such as do not 
come to bodily sense like that of man, but to that possessed by those who are there. I know that this is incredible to many, but this is because nothing is believed which cannot be seen by the bodily 
eyes and felt with the hands of flesh. For this reason the man of this day, whose interiors are closed, knows nothing of the things which exist in the spiritual world or in heaven. He does indeed say 
from the Word and from doctrine that there is a heaven, and that the angels who are there are in joy and in glory, but he knows no more about the matter. How the case is there he would indeed like to 
know, but when told he still believes nothing, because at heart he denies the existence of such things, and his desire to know about them is prompted solely by his curiosity from doctrine, and not by 
any delight grounded in faith. They who are not in faith also deny at heart; but they who believe get ideas from various sources about heaven and its joy and glory, each person from such things as are 
of his own knowledge and intelligence, and the simple from the things of bodily sensation. [2] Nevertheless most people do not apprehend that spirits and angels enjoy sensations much more exquisite 
than those of men in this world, namely, sight, hearing, smell, something analogous to taste, and touch; and especially the delights of the affections. If men would only believe that their interior 
essence is the spirit, and that the body and its sensations and members are adapted to uses in this world merely, and that the spirit and its sensations and organs are adapted to uses in the other life, 
then from themselves and almost of their own accord they would come into ideas about the state of their spirit after death; for they would reflect that the spirit must be the man himself who thinks, 
and who desires, longs for things, and is affected with them; and further that all the power of sensation which appears in the body belongs properly to the spirit, and to the body merely by influx; 
and they would afterwards confirm themselves in this idea by many considerations, and in this way would at last take more delight in the things of their spirit than in those of their body.  [3] It is 
also a real fact that it is not man's body which sees, hears, smells, and feels, but his spirit; and therefore when the spirit is divested of the body, it is in its own sensations, the same as when it 
was in the body, only now far more exquisite; for the things of the body, being comparatively gross, had rendered the sensations obtuse, and this the more because the man had immersed them in earthly 
and worldly things. This I can aver-that a spirit has much more exquisite sight than a man in the body, and also much more exquisite hearing, and, astonishing to say, the sense of smell, and especially 
the sense of touch; for spirits see one another, hear one another, and touch one another. Moreover, anyone who believes in the life after death might infer that this is the case from the fact that 
no life is possible without sensation, and that the quality of the life is according to the quality of the sensation, nay, that the intellectual faculty is nothing but an exquisite sense of interior 
things, and the higher intellectual of spiritual things; and it is from this that the things of the intellectual and its perceptions are called internal senses. [4] As regards man's power of sensation 
immediately after death the case is this: As soon as a man dies and all things of his body grow cold, he is raised up into life, and at the same time into a state of all sensations; insomuch that at 
first he scarcely knows but that he is still in the body, for the sensations he then enjoys lead him so to believe. But when he observes that he has more exquisite sensations, and especially when he 
begins to speak with other spirits, it dawns upon him that he is in the other life, and that the death of his body has been the continuation of the life of his spirit. I have spoken with two of my acquaintances 
on the day of their burial, and with one who through my eyes saw his coffin and his bier; and as this man enjoyed all the sensation he had in this world, he spoke to me about the burial rites 
while I was following in his funeral procession, and also about his body, saying that they should throw that away because he himself was alive. [5] Be it known, however, that they who are in the other 
life can see nothing whatever in this world through the eyes of any man; but that their being able to do so through mine was because I am in the spirit with them and at the same time in the body 
with those who are in the world (see also n. 1880). And be it further known that I did not see with my bodily eyes those with whom I have spoken in the other life, but with the eyes of my spirit; and 
yet I saw them as clearly, and sometimes more clearly, than with the eyes of the body; for of the Lord's Divine mercy the senses of my spirit have been opened. [6] But I am aware that what I have so 
far said will not be believed by those who are immersed in bodily, earthly, and worldly things (that is, by those of them who have such things as their end), for such people apprehend no other things 
than those which are dissipated by death. I am also well aware that those will not believe who have thought much and investigated much about the soul, and who have not at the same time comprehended that 
the soul of man is his spirit, and that his spirit is the man himself who is living in the body; for such persons could have no other notion about the soul than as of a thinking principle, whether 
of flame or of ether, that acts solely into the organic forms of the body, and not into those purer forms which are of the spirit in the body; thus that the soul is such a thing as must be dissipated 
together with the body. And this is especially the case with those who have confirmed themselves in such things by views that are inflated with a persuasion of their own preeminent wisdom. </p>

CORRESPONDENCE WITH THE GRAND MAN - continued IN THIS SECTION THE CORRESPONDENCE OF SMELL AND OF THE NOSTRILS WITH THAT GRAND MAN </p>
<p>The dwelling-places of the blessed in the next life are many and varying. 
They are built so elegantly that they are so to speak the embodiments of architectural art itself or the direct products of that art. Concerning the dwelling-places of the blessed, see what has 
been described already from experience, in <a href="1119.htm">1119</a>, <a href="1626.htm">1626</a>-<a href="1630.htm">1630</a>. The blessed are aware of these dwelling- places not only through the sense of sight but also through that of touch; for everything in that 
life is suited to the sensory powers which spirits and angels possess. Consequently their dwelling-places are not of the same nature as the objects perceived by man with his physical senses, but as the 
objects perceived by the senses which those in the next life possess. I realize that many cannot believe this, and the reason they cannot do so lies in their lack of belief in anything which they cannot 
see with their bodily eyes or touch with their physical hands. As a consequence man today, the interiors of whose being are closed, has no knowledge of the things which come into being in the spiritual 
world or in heaven. He does, it is true, say - because the Word and doctrine so teach it - that there is a heaven, where angels live in joy and glory; but beyond that he knows nothing. He would 
indeed like to know what it is like there, but when he is told this he still fails to believe it, because in his heart he denies the very existence of heaven. The reason he would like to know stems 
from no more than curiosity aroused by what is taught in doctrine; it does not stem from any delight to know because of any real belief. Those who do not have any real belief in heaven also deny its existence 
in their hearts, whereas those who do have such belief acquire to themselves ideas about heaven, its joy and glory, from various sources. Each individual does so from whatever knowledge or understanding 
he has gained, or in the case of the simple from what they discern by means of their bodily senses. </p>
<p></p>
<p><b>[2]</b>
 Even so, the majority of people do not grasp the idea that spirits and angels have 
sensory powers that are far keener than men's in the world; that is to say, they have the powers of sight, hearing, smell, something analogous to taste, and touch, and above all else delights belonging 
to affections. If people did but believe that the inner essence of their being is spirit and that the body, and the senses and members of this, are suited solely to uses that are served in the world, 
whereas the spirit, and the senses and organs of this, are suited to uses that are served in the next life, they would arrive unaided and almost spontaneously at ideas about the state of their spirit 
after death. For in that case they would think of a person's spirit as his true self which thinks, has longings, has desires, and feels emotions, and after that they would think of each sensory power 
manifested in the body as that which belongs to the spirit, and to the body only through influx from this. These thoughts they would subsequently confirm for themselves from many other pieces of evidence, 
and so at length they would take more delight in the powers of their spirit than in those of their body. </p>
<p></p>
<p><b>[3]</b>
 There is something further to be said on this matter, namely that it is not the 
body which sees, hears, smells, and feels through touch, but a person's spirit. That being so, when the spirit sheds its body it retains the sensory powers it possessed when within the body; indeed these 
are now far keener. For that which belongs to the body, being gross compared with that belonging to the spirit, has blunted those sensory powers; and these have been made even blunter because of 
the person's immersion of them in earthly and worldly interests. I can say this quite definitely, that a spirit has far keener eyesight than man has in the body, as well as far keener hearing. A spirit 
also has - and this fact will astonish people - the sense of smell, and especially the sense of touch. For spirits can see one another, hear one another, and touch one another. Anyone who believes in 
a life after death would also deduce this from the fact that no life is possible without the senses, and that the exact nature of that life is determined by that of the senses. Indeed he would deduce 
that the power of understanding is nothing else than a keener sensory awareness of interior things, a more superior power of understanding being a sensory awareness of spiritual realities. This also 
explains why the powers of the understanding and their perception of things are called the internal senses. </p>
<p></p>
<p><b>[4]</b>
 So far as a person's sensory powers immediately after death are concerned, the position 
is this: As soon as he dies and the parts of the body grow cold, he is raised up into life, into a state which involves each of his sensory powers. At first he is scarcely aware that he is not still 
in the body, for the experience of his senses leads him to think he is still in it. But when he notices that his sensory powers are keener than before, and especially when he starts to speak to other 
spirits, he realizes that he is in the next life and that the death of his body has been a continuation of the life of his spirit. I have spoken to two of my acquaintances on the very day they were 
to be buried, and to one who through my eyes beheld his own coffin and bier. Since he still possessed each of the senses he had in the world, he spoke to me about his burial service even as I was taking 
part in the funeral procession. Regarding his body he said that they were putting this away because he was alive. </p>
<p></p>
<p><b>[5]</b>
 But it should be recognized that those in the next life cannot see anything 
whatever of what is in the world through the eyes of anyone in the world. The reason they have been able to do so through my eyes is that in my spirit I am present with them at the same time as I am 
present in my body with those who are in the world; see also <a href="1880.htm">1880</a>. In addition to this it should be recognized that I have not used the eyes of my body to see those I have spoken to in the next life, 
but the eyes of my spirit. I have seen them as clearly, and sometimes more clearly, than with my bodily eyes, for in the Lord's Divine mercy the sensory powers of my spirit have been opened. </p>
<p></p>
<p><b>[6]</b>
 But 
I realize that what has been stated up to now is not going to be believed by people who are concerned solely with bodily, earthly, and worldly interests, that is, by those of them who have these interests 
as their end in view. For such people have no conception of anything apart from that which is dissipated by death. I also realize that what has been stated up to now is not going to be believed 
by those who have thought a lot about the soul and have asked many questions about it, without at the same time grasping the point that man's soul is his spirit and that his spirit is his real self living 
within the body. For these people have been unable to conceive of the soul as anything else than something like thought, or flame, or what is ethereal, which operates solely within the organic forms 
of the body, not within purer forms belonging to his spirit within the body, and so is the kind of thing that is dissipated along with the body. This applies especially to those who have convinced 
themselves of ideas like these because the picture they have of themselves has been magnified out of all proportion by the false notion that they are wiser than others. </p>

Continuatio de Correspondentia cum Maximo Homine, hic de Correspondentia Odoris et Narium cum illo. </p>
<p>Sunt habitacula beatorum in altera vita varia, tali arte constructa ut sint quasi in ipsa arte 
architectonica, seu immediate ab ipsa arte; de habitaculis beatorum videantur quae prius ab experientia, n. (x)1119, 1626-1630; haec non solum apparent illis coram visu, sed etiam coram tactu; omnia 
enim quae ibi sunt, adaequata sunt sensationibus spirituum et angelorum, inde sunt talia quae non cadunt sub sensum corporeum qualis est hominis, sed sub illum qui est illis qui ibi sunt: scio quod 
hoc multis incredibile sit, sed ex causa quia nihil creditur quod non oculis corporeis videri, et manibus carneis palpari potest; inde {1}est quod homo hodie, cui occlusa sunt interiora, nihil 
sciat de illis quae existunt in mundo spirituali aut caelo; dicit quidem ex Verbo et ex doctrina quod {2}caelum sit et quod {3}angeli qui ibi, sunt in gaudio et in gloria, {4}et praeterea nihil novit; 
optat quidem ut sciat quomodo se ibi habet, sed cum ei dicitur, usque nihil credit, ex causa quia corde negat dari; cum optat scire, est solum quia tunc in curioso est ex doctrina, non in jucundo 
ex fide; qui non in fide sunt, illi quoque corde negant; at qui credunt, illi comparant sibi ideas de caelo, ejus gaudio et gloria, ex variis, quisque ex talibus quae suae scientiae ac intelligentiae 
sunt, at simplices ex sensitivis quae corporis sunt; 2 sed usque plerique non capiunt quod spiritus et angeli sensationibus polleant multo exquisitioribus quam homines in mundo, nempe visu, auditu, 
olfactu, analogo gustus, et tactu, ac imprimis jucundis {5}affectionum; si modo credidissent quod essentia eorum interior esset spiritus, et quod corpus (c)ac corporis sensationes et membra 
sint modo adaequata usibus in mundo, et spiritus ac spiritus sensationes (c)et organa adaequata usibus in altera vita, tunc ex se et paene sua sponte venirent in ideas de statu spiritus sui post mortem, cogitarent 
enim tunc secum quod spiritus ejus foret ipse ille homo qui cogitat, et qui cupit, desiderat et afficitur, et dein quod omne id sensitivum quod apparet in corpore, esset proprie ejus spiritus, 
et corporis solum per influxum; et haec postea confirmarent apud se multis, et sic tandem delectarentur illis 3 quae {6}sui spiritus sunt, plus quam illis quae {6}sui corporis: </p>
<p>reipsa 
etiam ita se habet quod nempe corpus non sit quod videt, audit, {7}odoratur, sentit, sed spiritus ejus; quapropter cum spiritus exuitur corpore, tunc in suis sensationibus est, in quibus fuerat cum 
in corpore, et quidem in multo exquisitioribus; corporea enim, quia crassa {8}respective, sensationes {9}obtusas reddiderunt, et adhuc obtusiores quia immersit illas terrestribus (c)et mundanis: 
hoc asseverare possum, quod spiritus multo exquisitiorem visum habeat quam homo in corpore, tum quoque auditum, et quod {10}miraturi, sensum odoris, ac imprimis sensum tactus, vident enim se mutuo{11}, 
audiunt se mutuo, tangunt se mutuo; hoc quoque is qui credit vitam post mortem, concluderet ex eo quod nulla vita dari queat absque sensu, et quod quale vitae sit secundum quale sensus, immo quod 
intellectuale non sit nisi exquisitus sensus interiorum, et superius intellectuale rerum spiritualium; inde etiam quae intellectualis (c)et ejus 4 perceptionum sunt, vocantur sensus interni.  Cum 
sensitivo hominis statim post mortem, ita se habet: ut primum homo moritur et apud illum corporea frigescunt, exsuscitatur ille in vitam, et tunc in statum omnium sensationum, usque adeo ut primum 
vix {12}aliter sciat quam quod in corpore adhuc sit; sensationes enim in quibus est, adducunt illum ita credere, sed cum appercipit quod sensationes exquisitiores habeat, et hoc imprimis quando cum 
aliis spiritibus loqui incipit, tunc animadvertit quod in altera vita sit, et quod mors corporis ejus {13}fuerit continuatio vitae spiritus ejus.  Cum duobus quos notos habui, locutus sum eodem 
die {14}cum sepelirentur, et cum uno qui per meos oculos vidit suum loculum et {15}feretrum, et is quia in omni sensatione erat in qua in mundo, loquebatur mecum de exequiis, cum funeralia ejus sequerer, 
et quoque de suo corpore, dicendo, quod rejiciant illud quia ipse vivit.  Sed 5 sciendum quod illi qui in altera vita sunt, nihil quicquam quod in mundo per oculos alicujus hominis videre possint; 
sed quod per meos potuerint, erat quia spiritu cum illis sum, et simul corpore cum his qui in mundo, videatur etiam n. 1880: </p>
<p>ac praeterea sciendum quod illos cum quibus in altera vita locutus sum, 
non viderim oculis corporis mei, sed oculis spiritus mei, et usque tam {16}clare, et quandoque {17}clarius quam oculis corporis, nam, ex Divina Domini Misericordia, aperta sunt illa quae spiritus mei 
sunt.  Sed scio quod 6 haec quae hactenus dicta sunt, non credituri sint illi qui corporeis, terrestribus et mundanis immersi sunt, hoc est, ii eorum qui illa pro fine habent, hi enim non 
alia capiunt quam quae per mortem dissipantur: scio etiam quod nec credituri sint qui multum cogitarunt et disquisiverunt de anima, et non simul comprehenderunt quod anima sit ejus spiritus, et quod ejus 
spiritus sit ipse ejus homo qui vivit in corpore; hi enim non aliam notionem de anima capere potuerunt quam quod sit aliquod cogitativum, aut flammeum, aut aethereum, quod solum agit in formas organicas 
corporis, et non in formas puriores quae sunt ejus spiritus in corpore, {18}et sic tale quod cum corpore dissiparetur; </p>
