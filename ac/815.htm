<h4 align="center"></h4><p><strong>815.</strong>那些以仇恨、因而以报复为乐，以至于不满足于杀死肉体，还想摧毁主已救赎的灵魂之人，会被发送下去，然后穿过朝向地底处的一个漆黑开口进入深渊，深渊的深度与其仇恨和报复的程度成正比。他们在那里惊恐万分，同时被保持在报复的欲望中。随着这种欲望增强，他们被送入更低的深渊。之后，他们被送进火坑下面的一个地方，在那里会看到巨大而可怕的大肚蛇，它们栩栩如生，仿佛真的一样。这些精灵（灵）会遭受这些大肚蛇的咬噬，而且能强烈地感受到。精灵对这类事物感觉非常敏锐，因为这类事物回应他们的生活，就象肉体之物回应处于肉体之人的生活一样。在此期间，他们生活在可怕的幻觉中，这些幻觉会持续很长时间，直到他们不再知道自己曾是人类。他们从仇恨和报复欲中所获得的生命无法用其它方法来消除。</p>

<p><strong>[NCE]815.</strong> Some take so much pleasure in hatred and the revenge it inspires that they are not content simply to kill the body but long to destroy the soul as well, although the Lord redeems the soul. They are lowered though a dark hole toward the bowels of the earth, the depth to which they go being determined by the intensity of their hatred and the vengefulness growing out of it. A dreadful terror and horror then strike them, while they are being held in the grip of their lust for revenge. As that desire grows, they slip even farther down.<br />Later they are sent to a place beneath Gehenna,{*1} where big, terrifying, round-bellied snakes appear, as lifelike as if they actually existed. They torture the vengeful spirits with their bites, which the spirits experience just as vividly as they do the snakes. Spirits feel these sensations — corresponding as they do to the spirits' lives — as keenly as people living in the body feel bodily sensation.<br />Meanwhile they live out their dreadful fantasies, wallowing in them for ages, until they no longer know that they were once human. By no other method can the way of life that they acquired from such acts of hatred and revenge be extinguished.<br /><br /><strong>Footnotes:</strong><br />{*1} On the hell called Gehenna in the spiritual world, see <a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_815/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_825" target=_top>825-826</a>.

They who so delight in hatred and the consequent revenge that they are not content to kill the body only, but desire to destroy the soul, which yet the Lord has redeemed, are sent down through a very 
dark opening toward the lowest parts of the earth, to a depth proportionate to the degree of their hatred and vindictiveness; and there they are struck with grievous terror and horror, and at the same 
time are kept in the lust for revenge; and as this increases they are sent down to lower depths. Afterwards they are sent into a place beneath Gehenna, where great and dreadful thick-bellied serpents 
appear (so vividly that it is just as if they were real), by whose bites they are tormented, feeling them acutely. Such things are keenly felt by spirits, answering to their life just as things of the 
body do to the life of those who are in the body. Meanwhile they live in direful phantasies for ages, until they no longer know that they have been men. Their life, which they have derived from such 
hatreds and revenges, cannot otherwise be extinguished. </p>

<p align="center"><b>Elliott(1983-1999) 815</b></p><p><b>815.</b>
As for those who delight in hating and consequently in getting revenge to such an extent that they are not satisfied with destroying the body, but also desire to destroy the soul, which however the Lord 
has redeemed, they are sent down by way of a most gloomy hollow towards the lowest parts of the earth, to a depth that accords with the degree of their hatred and consequent desire for revenge. They 
are there stricken with great terror and horror, and at the same time they are held in their desire for revenge; and as this increases they are sent down further still. Subsequently they are sent to 
a place beneath Gehenna where large and dreadful snakes with big fat bellies are seen, as vivid as if they were real, by whose bites they are afflicted, which they feel intensely. Such things are felt 
keenly by spirits, for such things answer to their lives in the way that bodily things answer to the lives of people who are dwelling in the body. During this time they live with dreadful delusions, 
which continue with them for ages, till at length they no longer know that they have been human beings. Their life, which they have acquired from such hatred and desire for revenge, can be eliminated 
in no other way. </p>

</p><b>815.</b>
Qui ita delectantur odiis et inde vindictis ut non solum non contenti sint perdere corpus, sed etiam cupiunt animam quam tamen Dominus redemit; demittuntur deorsum per tenebrosissimum foramen versus 
infima terrae, profunde secundum gradum odii et inde vindictae; et iis tunc terror et horror incutitur gravis, et simul tenentur in vindictae cupidine, quae sicut augetur profundius demittuntur: postea 
mittuntur in locum sub Gehenna, ubi serpentes diri, magni, ventribus ampli, apparent, et quidem ita ad vivum sicut prorsus forent, a quibus cruciantur morsibus, quos quoque similiter acute sentiunt: 
talia sentiuntur exquisite a spiritibus; respondent eorum vitae, sicut corporea illis qui in corpore: et interea vivunt in diris phantasiis, et ibi per saecula, usque dum non amplius sciant quod homines 
fuerint; aliter eorum vita, quam ex odiis et vindictis talibus traxerant, non exstingui potest. </p>
