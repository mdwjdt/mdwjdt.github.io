<h3 align="center" class="ired">属天的奥秘 第6639节</h3>
<h4 align="center"></h4><p><strong>6639.</strong>“人和他的家，他们都来了”表在真理方面和在良善方面。这从“人”和“家”的含义清楚可知：“人”是指真理（参看<a href="3134.htm">3134</a>，<a href="3459.htm">3459</a>节）；“家”是指良善（<a href="3720.htm">3720</a>，<a href="4982.htm">4982</a>节）。由于在创世记，论述雅各的儿子们和雅各本人到埃及约瑟那里去的章节在内义上论述的主题是教会的真理被引入记忆知识，并且在引入之前教会不会建立，故按照内义上的这种思路，此处论述的主题是已建立的教会，以及该教会如何不断被记忆知识和虚假侵扰。因为无论真理如何被引入，教会如何在一个人里面得以建立，记忆知识和虚假仍不断冒上来，攻击他里面的教会事物。这些就是法老和埃及人苦害以色列人，想要杀死他们的男婴所代表的。<br />人若不知道在那些在来世属教会的人当中，教会的真理被这类知识和虚假攻击是何情形，绝不会相信这种事是真的。进入来世的教会成员必须从侵扰真理与良善的那类事物中得以洁净；否则，他不可能被提入天堂，住在那里已从这类事物中得以洁净之人的社群中。在完成这种洁净之前，他若真的被提入天堂，就会像清新空气所包围的尘雾，或像亮光中间的斑点或黑点。因此，为叫刚从世界来的教会成员能得以洁净，他被保持在被与真理不一致的记忆知识，以及虚假攻击的状态；这种状态会持续到这些知识对他来说变得一文不值，并被移除为止。这种情况很少发生在活在肉身期间的世人身上，但在来世却发生在那些将要被提入天堂的人身上；不过，这一过程也存在相当多的变化。我通过大量经历得知这一切都是真的；这些经历若都讲述出来，会占用大量篇幅。<br />这些就是以色列人被埃及人压迫，后来被释放，最终在旷野中经历了各个状态之后被引入迦南地在内义上所描述的事。那些以为救恩仅仅是出于怜悯而获准进入天堂，并且凡基于被称为信的表面信靠而认为自己能得救，无论他过着什么样的生活，因为主已代他受难的人都能获准进入的人，绝无可能理解这一切的真相。事实上，如果救恩仅仅是出于怜悯获准进入天堂，那么全世界所有人都会得救，因为作为怜悯本身的主愿意所有人得救，无人死亡或被罚入地狱。</p>

A man and his house they came. That this signifies as to truth and as to good, is evident from the signification of a "man" [vir] as being truth (see n. 3134, 3459); and from the signification of a "house," 
as being good (n. 3720, 4982). As in those chapters in Genesis which treat of the coming of the sons of Jacob, and of Jacob himself, into Egypt to Joseph, the subject treated of in the internal 
sense was the initiation of the truths of the church into memory-knowledges, and as the church has not been set up anew until this initiation has taken place, here therefore, according to the series 
of things in the internal sense, the renewed church is treated of, and how it is continually infested by memory-knowledges and falsities. For however well truths have been initiated and the church set 
up with a man, still such knowledges and falsities are continually rising up and assaulting what is of the church in him. It is this which is represented by Pharaoh and the Egyptians afflicting the 
sons of Israel, and being desirous to kill their infant boys.  [2] He who does not know how the case is with the assailing of the truth of the church by such knowledges and falsities with those who are 
of the church in the other life, can in no wise believe that it is so. The man of the church who comes into the other life must be purified from such things as infest truths and goods; otherwise he 
cannot be uplifted into heaven, and be there in a society which has been purified from such things. If he were to be uplifted thither sooner, he would be like a dense earthly vapor in a serene aura, 
or like a black mass in a bright light. In order therefore that a man of the church who has recently come from the world may be purified, he is kept in a state to be assailed by memory-knowledges which 
disagree with truths, and also by falsities, and this until these knowledges become of no account, and are removed. This seldom takes place with man during his life in the body, but in the other life 
it takes place with those who are to be uplifted into heaven, and this with much variety. From much experience, which would fill many pages if all were adduced, it has been given me to know that it 
is so. [3] These are the things which in the internal sense are described by the sons of Israel being oppressed by the Egyptians, and being afterward delivered, and at last, after various states in the 
wilderness, being brought into the land of Canaan. That such is the case can in no wise be comprehended by those who believe that salvation is merely an introduction into heaven from mercy, that is 
granted to everyone who from apparent trust, which is called faith, has thought that because the Lord has suffered for him, he will be saved no matter how he has lived. For if salvation were merely an 
introduction into heaven from mercy, all in the whole world would be saved, because the Lord, who is mercy itself, wills the salvation of all, and the death or damnation of no one. </p>

<p align="center"><b>Elliott(1983-1999) 6639</b></p><p><b>6639.</b>
'A man and his household they came' means in regard to truth and in regard to good. This is clear from the meaning of 'a man' as truth, dealt with in <a href="3134.htm">3134</a>, <a href="3459.htm">3459</a>; and from the meaning of 'household' or 
'house' as good, dealt with in <a href="3720.htm">3720</a>, <a href="4982.htm">4982</a> Since the subject in those chapters in  Genesis that deal with the coming of Jacob's sons, and of Israel himself, into Egypt to Joseph was the introduction 
of the Church's truths into factual knowledge, and since the Church was not established until after that introduction had taken place, the subject now - keeping to the train of thought in the internal 
sense - is the Church which has been established and the way in which it is constantly molested by factual knowledge and falsities. For no matter how far truths have been introduced and the Church has 
been established with a person, factual knowledge and falsities are nevertheless constantly rising up and attacking the things of the Church that are present with him. These are the considerations that 
are represented by the fact that Pharaoh and the Egyptians afflicted the children of Israel and wished to kill their baby boys. </p>
<p></p>
<p><b>[2]</b>
 Anyone unacquainted with the situation in which the Church's 
truth is under attack from factual knowledge and falsities among those in the next life who belong to the Church cannot possibly believe that such a thing is true. A member of the Church who enters the 
next life has to be purified from the kinds of things that molest truths and forms of good, otherwise he cannot be raised into heaven and live among a community of people there who have been purified 
from the same kind of things. If he were raised into heaven before such purification had taken place he would be like fog surrounded by clear air or like a patch or darkness amid bright light. In order 
therefore that a member of the Church recently arrived from the world may undergo purification, he is kept in a state in which he may receive attacks from factual knowledge that does not agree with 
truths, and also from falsities; and he remains in this state until that factual knowledge becomes worthless to him and is removed. This rarely happens to a person during his lifetime, but in the next 
life it is exactly what happens to those who are to be raised into heaven, though there is considerable variation to the process. I have been allowed to know that all this is true from much experience, 
which would fill quite a number of if all of it were recounted. </p>
<p></p>
<p><b>[3]</b>
 There are the matters that are described in the internal sense by the oppression of the children of Israel by the Egyptians, 
after that by their deliverance from them, and finally by their introduction - after various states in the wilderness - into the land of Canaan. The truth of all this cannot possibly be grasped by those 
who believe that salvation is simply being admitted into heaven through an act of mercy, and that anyone can be admitted who thinks - on the basis of seeming trust, called faith - that he can be saved, 
regardless of the life he has led, because the Lord has suffered on his behalf. For if salvation involved simply being admitted into heaven through an act of mercy, then everyone in the whole world 
would be saved, since the Lord, who is Mercy itself, desires the salvation of all and the death or damnation of none. </p>

`Vir et domus ejus venerunt': quod significet quoad verum et quoad bonum, constat ex significatione `viri' quod sit verum de qua n. 3134, 3459; et ex significatione `domus' quod sit bonum de qua n. 
3720, 4982. Quia in illis capitibus in Genesi ubi agitur de adventu filiorum Jacobi, et de ipsius Jacobi, in Aegyptum ad Josephum actum est de initiatione verorum quae sunt Ecclesiae, in scientifica, 
et prius Ecclesia non instaurata est quam postquam initiatio facta est, hic ideo secundum seriem rerum in sensu interno agitur de Ecclesia instaurata, et quomodo illa continue infestatur a scientificis 
et falsis; nam utcumque vera initiata sunt, et Ecclesia apud hominem instaurata est, usque tamen scientifica et falsa {1}continue insurgunt et illa quae Ecclesiae sunt apud illum impugnant; haec sunt 
qua repraesentantur per quod Pharao et Aegyptii affixerint filios Israelis, et necare voluerint infantes pueros illorum. 	Qui non scit quomodo se habet cum impugnatione veri Ecclesia a scientificis 
et falsis apud illos qui ab Ecclesia sunt, in altera vita, nequaquam potest credere quod ita sit; homo Ecclesiae qui in alteram vitam venit purificandus est a talibus quae infestant vera et bona, alioquin 
non elevari potest in caelum, et ibi interesse societati quae purificata est a talibus; si (x)illuc prius elevaretur, foret sicut vapor densus terrestris in serena aura, {2}aut sicut moles nigricans 
in candida luce; ut itaque homo ille Ecclesiae recens e mundo veniens purificetur, tenetur ille in statu ut impugnetur a scientificis quae discordant cum veris, et quoque a falsis, et hoc eousque 
dum scientifica illa nauci fiunt et removentur; hoc raro fit apud {3}hominem dum vivit in corpore, sed in altera vita cum illis qui elevandi sunt in caelum, ita fit; sed hoc {4} cum {5}pluri varietate; 
hoc quod ita sit, datum est {6}scire ex multa experientia, quae omnis si adduceretur, plures paginas impleret. 	Haec sunt quae in sensu interno describuntur per `filios Israelis' quod oppressi fuerint 
ab Aegyptiis, ac postea quod liberati, ac demum post varios status in deserto, quod introducti {7} in terram Canaanem.  Quod ita se res habeat, nequaquam possunt comprehendere illi qui credunt quod 
salvatio sit modo introductio in caelum ex misericordia, quae datur unicuique qui ex apparente fiducia, quae vocatur fides, cogitaverit quod quia passus pro illo Dominus, salvetur, utcumque vixerit; 
si enim salvatio foret solum introductio in caelum ex misericordia, omnes in universo orbe terrarum salvarentur; nam Dominus Qui est ipsa Misericordia omnium salutem vult, et nullius mortem {8}seu damnationem 
{9}. 	@1 Before scientifica$ 	@2 aut altered to et$ 	@3 aliquem$ 	@4 i fit$ 	@5 multa A, plus I, plurima T$ @6 Before datum$ 	@7 i sint$ 	@8 , hoc est,$ 	@9 i vult$ </p>
