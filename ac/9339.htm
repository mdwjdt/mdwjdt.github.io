Verses 31-33. And I will set thy border from the sea Suph, and even unto the sea of the Philistines; and from the wilderness even unto the river; for I will give into your hand the inhabitants of the 
land, and I will drive them out from before thee. Thou shalt not make a covenant with them, and with their gods. They shall not dwell in thy land, lest perchance they make thee sin against Me, when thou 
shalt serve their gods, because it will be a snare to thee. "And I will set thy border from the sea Suph, and even unto the sea of the Philistines," signifies extension from memory-truths to the interior 
truths of faith; "and from the wilderness even unto the river," signifies from the delight of what is sensuous, even to the good and truth of the rational; "for I will give into your hand the 
inhabitants of the land," signifies command over evils; "and I will drive them out from before thee," signifies their removal; "thou shalt not make a covenant with them, and with their gods," signifies 
no communication with evils and falsities; "they shall not dwell in thy land," signifies that evils shall not be together with the goods of the church; "lest perchance they make thee sin against Me," 
signifies lest evils turn away the goods that are from the Lord; "when thou shalt serve their gods," signifies if there be worship from falsities; "because it will be a snare to thee," signifies by 
reason of the allurement and deception of evils. </p>

Verses 31-33 And I will set your boundary from the Sea Suph even to the Sea of the Philistines, and from the wilderness even to the River;<A name="fntext1"></a><A href="#fn1"><sup>a</sup></a> for I will give the inhabitants of the land into your hand, 
and you will drive them out<A name="fntext2"></a><A href="#fn2"><sup>b</sup></a> from before you. You shall not make a covenant with them and their gods. They shall not dwell in your land, lest perhaps they cause you to sin against Me when you serve 
their gods; for it will be a snare to you.  </p>
<p>'And I will set your boundary from the Sea Suph even to the Sea of the Philistines' means the full range of truths from factual ones to interior truths of 
faith. 'And from the wilderness even to the River' means from delight belonging to the sensory level even to good and truth belonging to the rational level. 'For I will give the inhabitants of the land 
into your hand' means dominion over evils. 'And you will drive them out from before you' means the removal of them. 'You shall not make a covenant with them and their gods' means no contact with evils 
and falsities. 'They shall not dwell in your land' means that evils must not exist together with the Church's forms of good. 'Lest perhaps they cause you to sin against Me' means lest evils turn 
away forms of good from the Lord. 'When you serve their gods' means if worship is kindled by falsities. 'For it will be a snare to you' means owing to evils that are enticing and deceptive.

Vers. 31-33.  Et ponam terminum tuum a mari Suph et usque ad mare Philisthaeorum, et a deserto usque ad fluvium; quia dabo in manum vestram habitatores terrae, et expelles {1} illos ab ante te.  Non 
panges illis et diis illorum foedus.  Non habitabunt in terra tua, ne forte faciant peccare te Mihi, cum serviveris diis illorum, quia erit tibi in laqueum.  `Et ponam terminum tuum a mari Suph et usque 
ad mare Philisthaeorum' significat extensionem a veris scientificis ad vera interiora fidei: `et a deserto usque ad fluvium' significat a jucundo sensualis usque ad bonum et verum rationalis: `quia 
dabo in manum vestram habitatores terrae significat imperium super malis: `et expelles {2} illos ab ante te' significat remotionem eorum: `{3} non panges illis {4} et diis illorum foedus' significat 
non communicationem cum malis et falsis: `non habitabunt in terra tua' significat {5} quod mala non simul erunt cum bonis Ecclesiae: `ne forte faciant peccare te Mihi' significat ne mala avertant bona 
a Domino: `cum serviveris diis illorum' significat si cultus ex falsis: `quia erit ibi in laqueum' significat ex allectatione (c)et deceptione malorum. {6} @1 expellam IT Sch$ @2 expellam AIT$ @3
