<h3 align="center" class="ired">属天的奥秘 第2731节</h3>
<h4 align="center"></h4><p><strong>2731.</strong>我从上古之人那里听说，婚姻之爱具有这样的性质：即一方渴望完全成为对方的；并且这种渴望是相互的；当双方表达这种渴望并从对方那里接受它时，他们便体验到天堂的幸福。我还听说，其心智的结合具有这样的性质：这种相互渴望的表达和接受存在于生命的每一个细节中，即存在于情感的每一个部分和思维的每一个部分中。因此，主命定：妻子应成为对属于意愿的良善的情感，而丈夫应成为对属于理解力的真理的思维；并且婚姻应通过这种情感和思维存在，就是诸如意愿与理解力之间，有与真理结合的良善和与良善结合的真理在其中之人所具有的一切事物之间的那种婚姻。</p>

From those most ancient people it has been heard that conjugial love is of such a nature as to desire to be altogether the other's, and this reciprocally; and that when this is experienced mutually and 
reciprocally they are in heavenly happiness: also, that the conjunction of minds is of such a nature that this mutuality and reciprocity is in everything of their life, that is, in everything of their 
affection, and in everything of their thought. On this account it has been instituted by the Lord that wives should be affections of good which are of the will, and husbands thoughts of truth which 
are of the understanding; and that from this there should be a marriage such as there is between the will and the understanding, and between all things thereof with one who is in the good of truth and 
the truth of good. </p>

I have heard from those most ancient people that conjugial love is such that one partner desires to be wholly the other's, and that this desire is reciprocal; and that when partners are expressing and 
receiving it from each other they experience the happiness of heaven. I have also heard that their minds are so joined one to the other that the expression and receipt of that reciprocal desire exists 
in every single detail of life, that is, in every single part of affection and in every single part of thought. For this reason it has been ordained by the Lord that wives should be affections for 
good which belong to the will and that husbands should be thoughts about truth which belong to the understanding; also that marriage should exist from such affection and thought, like that between will 
and understanding, and between every single part of these with the person in whom good married to truth exists, and truth married to good. </p>

</p><b>2731.</b>
Auditum ab antiquissimis illis est quod amor conjugialis sit talis ut velit prorsus esse alterius, et hoc reciproce, et cum mutuo {1} et vicissim, quod in caelesti felicitate sint; tum quod conjunctio 
mentium talis sit ut (t)hoc mutuum et vicissim sit in omnibus et singulis vitae, hoc est, in omnibus et singulis affectionis et in omnibus et singulis cogitationis. Idcirco institutum esse a Domino 
quod uxores sint affectiones boni quae voluntatis, et viri sint cogitationes veri quae intellectus, et quod conjugium inde sit, quale est inter voluntatem et intellectum, et inter omnia et singula eorum 
apud hominem qui est in bono veri et vero boni. 	@1 i alterius.$ </p>
