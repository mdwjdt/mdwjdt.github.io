<h3 align="center" class="ired">属天的奥秘 第7050节</h3>
<h4 align="center"></h4><p><strong>7050.</strong>这三节经文含有奥秘，若没有内义，没有人能知道，这一点从其中的每个细节明显看出来。谁能知道耶和华在吩咐摩西去埃及后不久遇见他，当摩西在路上时，耶和华就想要杀他是什么意思呢？谁又能知道西坡拉割下儿子的阳皮，使它接触摩西的脚，并对摩西说，他是她的血新郎了，接着又说，他因着割礼而是血新郎了，是什么意思呢？谁看不出这些细节含有奥秘在里面，并且这些奥秘若不藉着内义，绝无可能为人所知？</p>

That in these three verses there are secrets which cannot possibly be known without the internal sense, is evident from the details in them; for who would know what is signified by Jehovah, after He 
had commanded Moses to go to Egypt, presently, when he was in the way, meeting him, and seeking to kill him? Who would know what is signified by Zipporah, when she had cut off the foreskin of her son, 
making it touch his feet, and saying to Moses that he was a bridegroom of bloods to her, and also afterward by her saying that he was a bridegroom of bloods as to circumcisions? Who does not see that 
secrets have been stored up in these things, and that these secrets cannot possibly be disclosed except from the internal sense? </p>

These three verses, as is evident from each detail in them, contain arcana that no one can ever know about without the internal sense. How could anyone know what the meaning is when it says, after He 
had commanded Moses to go to Egypt, that Jehovah then immediately came to meet him and sought to kill him while he was on the way? How could anyone know what the meaning is when it says that having cut 
off her son's foreskin Zipporah caused it to touch his feet and told Moses that he was a bridegroom of blood to her, and then a little later said, A bridegroom of blood in regard to circumcisions? 
Who can fail to see that these details have arcana concealed within them and that those arcana cannot possibly be made known except from the internal sense?  </p>

Quod in his tribus versibus arcana sint quae nusquam sciri possunt absque sensu interno, a singulis ibi patet; quis enim sciret quid significat quod Jehovah, postquam Moschi mandaverat ut iret Aegyptum, 
mox dein cum esset in via, (x)occurreret illi, et quaereret occidere illum? quis sciret quid significat quod Zippora, cum absciderat praeputium filii sui, faceret tangere pedes ejus, et diceret ad 
Moschen quod sponsus sanguinum is sibi esset; tum quod dein diceret, Sponsus sanguinum ad circumcisiones? quis non videt quod in his arcana recondita sint, et quod {1}illa nequaquam detegi queant nisi 
ex sensu interno? 	@1 talia$ </p>
