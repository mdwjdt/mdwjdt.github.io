<h3 align="center" class="ired">属天的奥秘 第548节</h3>
<h4 align="center"></h4><p><strong>548.</strong>有几次，我和尘世来的新灵谈论永生的状态，并告诉他们说，知道谁是那王国的主，其政府制度及形式如何对他们来说极其重要。跟世间一样，当人去往另一国度时，都希望提前了解谁是国王，他是什么样的人，实行什么样的政府制度等等。对于这个他们即将在此生活到永远的国度，不更应该这样做吗?我告诉他们，唯独主统管天堂和整个宇宙，因为统管这一个的祂必统管另一个，还告知，他们现在所在的国度是主的王国，该王国的律法就是永恒的真理，所有真理都基于这一伟大法则，即人当爱主高于一切，且爱邻如己。事实上，若他们想成为天使，必须超越过去，爱邻胜己。<br />听到这些话，他们无言以对，因为在世时他们听过这种事，但却不相信。尽管他们听说过要爱邻如己，但他们惊讶的发现，天堂真的有这种爱存在，并且谁都能爱邻胜己。他们被告知，在来生（灵界），所有善无限增长，而在肉身生活时人们没能做到爱邻如己，因为他们沉迷于肉体之物，但一旦后者被除去，爱会变得更纯粹，最终似天使一般。这就是爱邻胜己。<br />这种爱的可能性从某些人的夫妻之爱清楚看出，他们宁死也不愿让配偶受伤害。也可从父母对孩子的爱清楚看出，母亲宁愿受饥荒也不愿看到她的孩子挨饿，这爱甚至能从鸟和动物身上看出来。这种爱的可能性也能从真诚的友谊明显看出来，人们会由于友谊而为朋友冒险，甚至还能从礼貌而虚假的友谊看出来，这种友谊为效仿真正的友谊，也会为他们所祝愿的人提供更好的东西，口头表达善愿，即便不是发自内心。最后，其可能性还可从爱的性质看出来，爱的快乐就在于为了爱而服务他人，而不是为了自己。但那些爱己胜过他人者无法理解这一切，在世时贪恋钱财，尤其贪得无厌者也不理解。</p>

<p><strong>[NCE]548.</strong> Several times I have talked to spirits newly arrived from the world about the conditions of eternal life. "It's important for you to know who the Lord of the realm is, what his style of government is like, and what the form of government is," I pointed out. "On earth, the first thing you have to do on entering another country is to learn the identity and character of the monarch, the nature of the government, and other information about the country. How much more so in this realm, where you'll live forever?<br />"The Lord alone rules not just heaven but the whole universe," I said. "Whoever rules the one rules the other.<br />"The kingdom in which you now find yourself is the Lord's. The laws of this kingdom are eternal truths, all founded on this solitary law: you are to love the Lord above all and your neighbor as yourself. Not only this, in fact, but if you want to be like angels, you'll have to love your neighbor more than yourselves."<br />[2] To all this they had no answer, because during bodily life they had heard something similar but had not believed it. They were astounded to hear that in heaven people can and do love their neighbor more than themselves (although they had heard that they should love their neighbor as themselves).<br />"Everything good in the next life expands without limit," I told them. "Life bounded by the body is such that we can't progress any farther than loving our neighbor as ourselves, because we're wrapped up in bodily concerns. But when these concerns have been laid aside, love grows purer and purer until at last it is angelic. Angelic love is to love one's neighbor more than oneself.<br />[3] "That this kind of love is possible you could have known from the love between certain married partners who would prefer death to seeing their spouse injured. You could have known it from the love parents have for their children: a mother would rather starve than see her baby go hungry. And this is true even among birds and animals.<br />"You could have known it from true friendship in people who risk danger for the sake of their friends. You could even have known it from polite friendship — the pretense that tries to pass for real friendship — in which we offer the better portions to those in our good graces and bear selflessness on our lips (though not in our hearts).<br />"Last, you could have known it from the nature of love, which is such that its joy is to serve others, not for one's own sake but for the other person's."{*1} But these things were incomprehensible to those who loved themselves more than others and to those who had been money-grubbing during physical life. Least understanding of all were the misers.<br /><br /><strong>Footnotes:</strong><br />{*1} In the last three paragraphs, Swedenborg seems to follow the traditional Christian delineation of four different types of love: eros, or romantic, sexual love; storge, family feeling; philia, friendship; and agape, "charity" or selfless love. See Liddell and Scott 1968, under ἀγάπη (agápe), ἔρως (éros), φιλία (philía), στοργή (storgé); and Lewis [1960] 1988, throughout. [RS] </p>

I have sometimes spoken with spirits fresh from the world concerning the state of eternal life, telling them how important it was for them to know who is the Lord of that kingdom, and what is the nature 
and form of its government, just as those in this world who go into another kingdom are especially interested to know who and of what sort is the king, what is the nature of the government, and many 
other things that belong to the kingdom; and how much more should they be interested in this kingdom, where they are to live forever. I told them that the Lord alone rules both heaven and the universe, 
for He who rules the one must rule the other; and that the kingdom in which they were now is the Lord's kingdom, the laws of which are eternal truths, all of which are based on the one great law 
that men shall love the Lord above all things and their neighbor as themselves, and now even more than themselves, for if they would be as the angels this is what they must do. To all this they could 
make no reply, because in their bodily life they had heard something of the kind, but had not believed it. They marveled that there is such love in heaven, and that it is possible for anyone to love his 
neighbor more than himself, seeing that they had heard that they were to love their neighbor as themselves. But they were instructed that in the other life all goods are immeasurably increased, and 
that the life in the body is such that men can go no further than loving the neighbor as themselves because they are in the things of the body, but that when these are removed, the love becomes purer, 
and at last angelic, which consists in loving the neighbor more than themselves. The possibility of such love is evident from the conjugial love that exists with some persons, who would suffer death 
rather than let their married partner be injured; and also from the love of parents for their children, in that a mother will endure starvation rather than see her infant hunger, and this even among 
birds and animals; and likewise from sincere friendship, in that perils will be undergone for our friends; and even from polite and feigned friendship, that would emulate real friendship in offering the 
better things to those to whom we wish well, making great professions even when they do not come from the heart. And finally its possibility is evident from the very nature of love, which finds its 
joy in being of service to others, not for the sake of self but for the love's own sake. But all this could not be comprehended by those who loved themselves more than others, and who in the bodily life 
had been greedy for gain, and least of all by the avaricious. </p>

I have spoken several times to spirits recently arrived from the world about the state of eternal life, and have said that it was important for them to know who the Lord of that kingdom is, what is the 
system of government, and what form that government takes. It is the same in the world when people go to another kingdom; they wish to know beforehand who the king is and what he is like, what is the 
system of government, and many other facts concerning that kingdom. How much more does this apply in that kingdom where they are going to live for ever. I have told them that the Lord alone rules not 
only heaven but also the whole universe, for He who rules the one must rule the other, and also that the kingdom which they are now in is the Lord's kingdom, and that the laws of this kingdom are eternal 
truths, every one of which is based on the incomparable law that they are to love the Lord supremely and the neighbour as themselves. Indeed if they wished to be as the angels, they must now go 
beyond that and love the neighbour more than themselves.   </p>
<p><b>[2]</b>
 On hearing these things they have been speechless, for during their life-time they had heard something of the sort but had not believed 
it. Even though they had heard that they were to love the neighbour as themselves, they have been amazed that such love exists in heaven, and that it is possible for anyone to love the neighbour more 
than himself. They have been informed however that in the next life all goods increase without limit, whereas life in the body is such that they cannot progress beyond the point of loving their neighbour 
as themselves, because they are engrossed in bodily interests. Once the latter have been removed however, love becomes purer, and at length angelic. And this is loving the neighbour more than themselves. 
 </p>

<p><b>[3]</b>
 The possibility of such love has been made clear from the conjugial love of certain persons who would die rather than let their partner be harmed. It is also clear from the love of parents 
for their children; a mother would rather endure starvation than see her child go hungry, as is true even of birds and of animals. The possibility of that love is also apparent in real friendship 
in which people risk any danger for the sake of their friends. It is apparent even from that polite but counterfeit friendship which seeks to imitate real friendship by offering choicer things to those 
they wish well to, and by paying lip-service to good will even though it does not exist in their hearts. Finally, the possibility of loving the neighbour more than oneself is clear from the very 
nature of love whose joy resides in serving others for love's sake and not one's own. But people who loved themselves more than anybody else have not been able to grasp these things; nor have those who 
during their lifetime were eager for money, and least of all the avaricious.  </p>

</p><b>548.</b>
Cum spiritibus qui e mundo recens venerunt, aliquoties locutus de statu vitae aeternae, quod nempe iis scire {x}intersit, quis Dominus regni, quale regimen, et quae regiminis forma; sicut qui in mundo 
in aliud regnum veniunt, iis nihil prius est quam scire, quis et qualis rex, quale regimen, et plura quae istius regni sunt; magis in hoc regno in quo in aeternum victuri: et dictum, quod Dominus solus 
non modo regat caelum sed etiam universum, nam qui regit unum reget alterum; tum quod regnum in quo nunc sunt, sit Homini; et quod hujus regni leges sint veritates aeternae, quae omnes fundantur 
in illa unica lege ut ament Dominum supra omnia et proximum ut semet; immo nunc adhuc magis si velint esse sicut angeli, quod amare debeant proximum plus quam semet.  Cum haec audiverunt, nihil respondere 
poterant, quia in vita corporis tale quid audiverunt sed non crediderunt: mirati quod talis amor sit in caelo, et quod dabilis ut quisque amet proximum plus quam semet, cum tamen audiverunt quod 
amarent proximum sicut semet: sed informati quod omnia bona indefinite crescant in altera vita, et quod talis vita sit in corpore ut non ultra progredi possint quam amare proximum ut semet, quia in corporeis; 
at iis remotis, tunc amor magis purus fit, et tandem angelicus, qui est amare proximum plus quam semet. [3] Quod talis amor dabilis sit, constare potuit ex quorundam amore conjugiali, quod praetulerint 
mortem quam ut laederetur conjux: ex amore parentum erga liberos, quod mater potius famem patiatur quam ut videat infantem esurire; etiam apud aves et animalia: ut et ab amicitia sincera, quod 
pro amicis pericula subeant: etiam ex amicitia civili et simulata, quae aemulari vult sinceram, quod potiora offerant iis quibus bene volunt; et tale ore ferant tametsi non corde: demum ex natura 
amoris, quae talis est ut gaudium ejus sit inservire aliis, non sui sed ejus causa. Verum haec non potuerunt capere qui se prae aliis amabant; et qui lucri avidi in vita corporis fuerunt; omnium minime avari. </p>
