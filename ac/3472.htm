<h3 align="center" class="ired">属天的奥秘 第3472节</h3>
<h4 align="center"></h4><p><h4 align="center">关于代表和对应，尤其圣言中的（续）</h4><br />3472.圣言字义中的每一个事物都是主国度的某种属灵和属灵之物的代表，在至高意义上是主自己的代表。这一事实从目前的说明，以及蒙主的神圣怜悯，从进一步的说明可以看出来。但由于人如此远离天堂，沉浸于最低级的自然界，甚至沉浸于世俗，所以当听说圣言所隐藏的事比他从字面上所理解的还要深时，他完全排斥。当被告知圣言所隐藏的事超出世人的理解范畴，只适合天使的智慧时，更是如此；当被告知它隐藏着无限超出天使理解力的神性事物时，尤其如此。诚然，基督教界承认圣言是神性；但事实上，它是基督教界即便口头上不否认，仍在心里否认的那种神性。这也没什么奇怪的，因为如今世人所具有的世俗思维理解不了更高尚的事，并且他们也不愿去理解。</p>

CONTINUATION CONCERNING CORRESPONDENCES AND REPRESENTATIONS, ESPECIALLY THOSE IN THE WORD. That the things in the literal sense of the Word are each and all representative of the spiritual and celestial 
things of the Lord's kingdom in the heavens, and in the supreme sense are representative of the Lord Himself, may be seen from what has been thus far shown, and from what of the Lord's Divine mercy 
is still to be shown. But as man has removed himself so far from heaven, and has immersed himself in lowest nature, and even in what is earthly, it is altogether repugnant to him to hear that the Word 
contains deeper things than he apprehends from the letter; and this is still more the case when it is said that it contains things incomprehensible, which are adapted solely to the wisdom of angels; 
and this is even still more so when it is said that it contains Divine things themselves, which infinitely transcend the understanding of angels. The Christian world does indeed acknowledge that the 
Word is Divine, yet that it is Divine in this manner it denies at heart, if not with the lips; nor is this to be wondered at, inasmuch as the earthly thought in which man is at this day does not apprehend 
things of a sublime character; and is not willing to apprehend them. </p>

CORRESPONDENCES AND REPRESENTATIONS - continued  ESPECIALLY THOSE CONTAINED IN THE WORD </p>
<p>Every single thing in the sense of the letter of the Word is representative of something spiritual or celestial 
belonging to the Lord's kingdom in heaven, and in the highest sense is representative of the Lord Himself. This becomes clear from what has been shown already, and in the Lord's Divine mercy from 
what has yet to be shown. But because people have distanced themselves so far away from heaven and have engrossed themselves in nature far below, indeed in what is earthly, they are utterly repelled 
when told that the Word conceals deeper things than those grasped from the letter. They are even more repelled when told that the Word contains things that are beyond man's mental grasp and that are suited 
only to the wisdom of the angels; and they are still more repelled when told that it contains Divine things themselves infinitely transcending the angels' power of understanding. The Christian world 
does indeed acknowledge that the Word is Divine; but the fact that it is so Divine the Christian world nevertheless denies in its heart if not with its lips. Nor is this surprising since the earthly-mindedness 
which exists in people at the present day does not allow them to grasp more exalted things; nor do they wish to. </p>

Continuatio de Correspondentiis et Repraesentationibus, cumprimis de illis quae in Verbo </p>
<p>Quod omnia et singula quae in Verbi sensu litterae, sint repraesentativa spiritualium et caelestium regni 
Domini in caelis, ac in supremo sensu sint repraesentativa Ipsius Domini, constare potest ab illis quae hactenus ostensa sunt, et quae adhuc, ex Divina Domini Misericordia, ostendenda; sed quia homo tam 
longe se removit a caelo, ac se infimae naturae, immo terrestri, immersit, repugnat ei prorsus cum dicitur quod Verbum altiora recondat quam is ex littera capit, et magis cum dicitur quod contineat 
{1}incomprehensibilia {2}, modo quae angelorum sapientiae adaequata sunt, et adhuc magis, quod ipsa Divina, quae infinite {3}intellectum angelorum transcendunt: agnoscit quidem orbis Christianus quod 
Verbum Divinum sit, sed quod ita Divinum, si non ore, usque corde negat; quod nec mirum est quia terrestre in quo homo hodie est, sublimiora non capit, nec vult capere. @1 i etiam$  @2 i homini$  @3
