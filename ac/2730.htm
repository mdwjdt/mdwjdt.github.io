<h3 align="center" class="ired">属天的奥秘 第2730节</h3>
<h4 align="center"></h4><p><strong>2730.</strong>在这个地球上，上古教会成员尤其生活在婚姻真爱中，因为他们是居于来自良善的真理中的属天之人，与天使一起处于主的国度；他们因婚姻真爱而拥有天堂。但该教会在其后代中堕落，其后代开始爱自己的孩子，而不是爱自己的配偶；因为恶人也能爱自己的孩子，只有善人才会爱自己的配偶。</p>

The people of the Most Ancient Church above all on this earth lived in genuine conjugial love, because they were celestial, were in truth from good, and were in the Lord's kingdom together with the angels; 
and in that love they had heaven. But their posterity, with whom the church declined, began to love their children, and not their consorts; for children can be loved by the evil, but a consort 
can be loved only by the good. </p>

Members of the Most Ancient Church above all others on this earth lived in genuine conjugial love, because they were celestial people dwelling in truth from good, and were in the Lord's kingdom together 
with the angels; and it was in that love that for them heaven consisted. But their descendants, among whom the Church declined, began to love their children and not their married partners; for those 
who are evil are able to love their children, but only those who are good are able to love their married partner. </p>

</p><b>2730.</b>
Antiquissimae Ecclesiae homines prae omnibus in hac tellure in genuino amore conjugiali vixerunt, quia fuerunt caelestes a bono in vero, et in regno Domini simul cum angelis, et in illo amore fuit illis 
caelum: at posteri, apud quos descivit Ecclesia, coeperunt amare liberos, non conjuges; amari enim possunt liberi a malis, sed amari conjux non potest quam a bonis {1}. 	@1 n. 1272.$ </p>
