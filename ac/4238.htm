<h3 align="center" class="ired">属天的奥秘 第4238节</h3>
<h4 align="center"></h4><p><strong>4238.</strong>创世纪32:3-5.雅各打发使者在他前面，往西珥地去，就是以东的田野，见他哥哥以扫。吩咐他们说，你们对我主以扫这样说：你的仆人雅各这样说，我在拉班那里寄居，滞留到现在。我有牛、驴、羊群、仆婢，现在打发人来报告我主，为要在你眼前蒙恩。<br />“雅各打发使者在他前面，见他哥哥以扫”表通过真理与属天良善的第一次联系。“往西珥地去”表属天-属世良善。“就是以东的田野”表源于此的真理。“吩咐他们说，你们对我主以扫这样说”表首先承认良善占据更高位置。“我在拉班那里寄居，滞留到现在”表祂已为自己取得“拉班”所表示的良善。“我有牛、驴、羊群、仆婢”表以其适当次序存在于那里的获得物。“现在打发人来报告我主，为要在你眼前蒙恩”表关于祂的状态的教导，以及真理在良善面前的恭敬和谦卑。</p>

Verses 3-5. And Jacob sent messengers before him, to Esau his brother unto the land of Seir, the field of Edom. And he commanded them, saying, Thus shall ye say unto my lord Esau: Thus saith thy servant 
Jacob, I have sojourned with Laban, and have tarried until now. And I had ox and ass, flock, and manservant and handmaid; and I send to tell my lord, to find grace in thine eyes. "And Jacob sent messengers 
before him, to Esau his brother," signifies the first communication with celestial good; "unto the land of Seir," signifies celestial natural good; "the field of Edom," signifies the derivative 
truth; "and he commanded them, saying, Thus shall ye say unto my lord Esau," signifies the first acknowledgment of good as being in the higher place; "I have sojourned with Laban, and have tarried 
until now," signifies that He had imbued Himself with the good signified by "Laban;" "and I had ox and ass, and flock, and manservant and handmaid," signifies acquisitions therein in their order; "and 
I send to tell my lord, to find grace in thine eyes," signifies instruction concerning His state, and also the condescension and humiliation of truth in the presence of good. </p>

Verses 3-5 And Jacob sent messengers ahead of him to his brother Esau, to the land of Seir, the field of Edom. And he commanded them, saying, Thus shall you say to my lord Esau, Thus says your servant 
Jacob, With Laban I have sojourned, and have stayed until now. And I have oxen and asses, flocks and men servants and women servants; and I am sending to tell my lord, so as to find favour in your eyes. </p>
<p>'Jacob 
sent messengers ahead of him to his brother Esau' means the first communication by that truth with celestial good. 'To the land of Seir' means celestial-natural good. 'The field of Edom' 
means truth derived from this. 'And he commanded them, saying, Thus shall you say to my lord Esau' means the first acknowledgement that good occupied the higher position. 'With Laban I have sojourned, 
and have stayed until now' means that it had taken to itself the good meant by 'Laban'. 'And I have oxen and asses, flocks and men servants and women servants' means acquisitions existing there in 
their proper order. 'And I am sending to tell my lord, so as to find favour in your eyes' means information concerning its state, and also deference and self-abasement on the part of truth in the presence of good. </p>

Vers. 3-5.  Et misit Jacob nuntios coram se ad Esau fratrem suum terram Seir, agrum Edomi.  Et praecepit illis dicendo, Ita dicetis domino meo Esavo, Ita dicit servus tuus Jacob, Cum Labane peregrinatus 
sum, et moratus usque nunc.  Et fuit mihi bos et asinus, grex et servus et ancilla, et mitto ad indicandum domino meo ad inveniendum gratiam in oculis tuis. `Misit Jacob nuntios coram se ad 
Esau fratrem suum' significat communicationem primam cum bono caelesti: `terram Seir' significat bonum caeleste naturale: `agrum Edomi' significat verum inde: `et praecepit illis dicendo, Ita dicetis 
domino meo Esavo' significat agnitionem primam boni quod superiore loco esset: `Cum Labane peregrinatus sum, et moratus usque nunc' significat quod imbuerit bonum per Labanem significatum: `et 
fuit mihi bos et asinus, grex et servus et ancilla' significat acquisitiones suo ordine ibi: `et mitto ad indicandum domino meo ad inveniendum gratiam in oculis tuis' significat instructionem de statu 
suo, et quoque condescendentiam et humiliationem veri coram bono. </p>
