<h4 align="center"></h4><p><strong>5648.</strong>“因为他们被领到约瑟的屋里”表因为属于属世层的真理要被联结并顺服于内在。这从“被领到约瑟的屋里”的含义清楚可知，“被领到约瑟的屋里”是指被联结并顺服于内在。事实上，“约瑟”代表内在，因为他代表源于神性的真理，就是属灵层的属天层（参看<a href="5307.htm">5307</a>，<a href="5331.htm">5331</a>，<a href="5332.htm">5332</a>，<a href="5417.htm">5417</a>，<a href="5469.htm">5469</a>节）；“屋”（或家）表示人的内在和他的外在（<a href="3128.htm">3128</a>，<a href="3538.htm">3538</a>，<a href="4973.htm">4973</a>，<a href="5023.htm">5023</a>节），此处表示内在，因为经上说“约瑟的屋”；“被领”（到内在）表示与它联结，由此变得服从它。原因是，当属世层被联结于内在时，它就会变得服从它。因为之前属于属世人的统治权成了属灵人的。蒙主的神性怜悯，我们会在下文讨论这种统治权。<br />此处有必要用几句话补充说明内在意义（即内义）是何情形。圣言的内在意义尤其是为来世之人的利益而存在。与某个阅读圣言的世人同在时，来世之人会照着圣言的内在意义（即内义），而非外在意义领悟圣言。因为他们不明白世人的话语，只懂得这些话的意义；并且不是应用世人的属世思维，而是应用他们自己的属灵思维来明白这层意义。与世人同在的属世意义会立刻转换为这属灵意义；就像一个人将另一个人的语言翻成与之不同的他自己的母语一样，并且这是一瞬间的事。适合世人思维的属世意义正是以这种方式转换成属灵意义；因为属灵的语言或言语适合天使，属世的语言或言语适合世人。这一种语言之所以能即刻转换成那一种语言，是因为自然界中的每一个事物与灵界中的每一个事物之间存在一种对应关系。<br />由于圣言的内在意义主要是为了那些灵界中人的利益而存在，所以此处所提到的包含在内在意义中的那类细节就是为他们的利益而存在，并赋予他们愉悦和快乐的细节。然而，这些细节越内在，就越远离世人的理解范畴；对世人来说，只有世俗和身体事物能带给他愉悦和快乐。当是这种情况时，他们就会视包含在内在意义中的属灵事物为毫无价值，甚至憎恶它们。要让每个人都检查一下自己，看看包含在接下来的经文内在意义中的观念对他来说是不是毫无价值、令人厌恶。然而，这类观念却赋予天使社群最大的快乐。凡停下来反思的人由此都能看出，世人的快乐和天使的快乐之间有何不同，以及被天使视为智慧的是什么，被世人视为智慧的又是什么；也就是说，天使将世人认为毫无价值并心怀憎恶的那类事物视为智慧；而世人却将天使毫无兴趣的那类事物视为智慧，许多人甚至将天使所弃绝并躲避的那类事物视为智慧。</p>

Because they were brought to Joseph's house. That this signifies because the truths that belong to the natural were to be adjoined and subjected to the internal, is evident from the signification of 
"being brought to Joseph's house," as being to be conjoined and subjected to the internal; for by Joseph is represented the internal, because he represents truth from the Divine, or the celestial of the 
spiritual (see n. 5307, 5331, 5332, 5417, 5469); and by a "house" is signified man's internal as well as his external (n. 3128, 3538, 4973, 5023), here the internal, as it is called "Joseph's house;" 
and by "being brought" (namely, to the internal) is signified to be adjoined, and therefore to be subjected. The reason is that when the natural is adjoined to the internal, it is then subjected to 
it; for the command which had before belonged to the natural man, then becomes the spiritual man's; of which command, of the Lord's Divine mercy more will be said in the following pages. [2] A few words 
must here be added in regard to the internal sense. The internal sense of the Word is especially for those who are in the other life. When those who are there are with a man who is reading the Word, 
they perceive it according to the internal sense, and not according to the external; for they understand no human words, but only the sense of the words, and this not according to the man's natural 
thoughts, but according to their thoughts which are spiritual. Into this spiritual sense the natural sense that is with the man is at once transmuted, just as one turns the language of another into 
his own which is different, doing it in an instant. So is the sense of natural human thought turned into spiritual, for spiritual language or speech is proper to the angels, and natural language or speech 
to men. That there is so sudden a change of as it were one language into the other, is because there is a correspondence of each and all things in the natural world with those in the spiritual world. 
 [3] Now as the internal sense of the Word is chiefly for those who are in the spiritual world, therefore such things are here mentioned in the internal sense as are for them, and as are pleasant 
and delightful to them. Yet the more interior such things are, the more remote are they from the apprehension of men to whom only those things which are of the world and the body are pleasant and delightful; 
and when this is the case, they hold in contempt the spiritual things that belong to the internal sense, and also loathe them. Let everyone explore within himself whether the things contained 
in the internal sense of the verses that now follow are worthless and distasteful to him, when yet they are what the angelic societies take the greatest delight in. From this it may be plain to one 
who reflects what a difference there is between the delights of men and the delights of angels, and also in what things the angels vest wisdom, and in what men vest it - that the angels vest wisdom in 
such things as man thinks worthless and holds in aversion, and that man vests wisdom in such things as the angels care nothing about, and many in such things as the angels reject and shun. </p>

'Because they were brought to Joseph's house' means that the truths belonging to the natural were to be linked and made subservient to the internal. This is clear from the meaning of 'being brought to 
Joseph's house' as being joined and made subservient to the internal. For 'Joseph' represents the internal since he represents truth from the Divine, which is the celestial of the spiritual, dealt with 
in <a href="5307.htm">5307</a>, <a href="5331.htm">5331</a>, <a href="5332.htm">5332</a>, <a href="5417.htm">5417</a>, <a href="5469.htm">5469</a>; 'the house' means both a person's internal and his external, <a href="3128.htm">3128</a>, <a href="3538.htm">3538</a>, <a href="4973.htm">4973</a>, <a href="5023.htm">5023</a>, in this case the internal because the expression 'Joseph's house' is used; and 
'being brought to' - to the internal - means becoming linked to it. And as becoming linked to it is meant, being made subservient to it is meant as well, the reason being that when the natural becomes 
linked to the internal it is made subservient to it. For the dominion which has belonged previously to the natural man comes to belong subsequently to the spiritual. This dominion will in the Lord's 
Divine mercy be discussed later on. </p>

 Let a brief statement be made about what the situation is with the internal sense. The internal sense of the Word exists primarily for the benefit of those 
in the next life. When present with someone [on earth] who is reading the Word those in the next life perceive it according to its internal sense, not its external sense. For they do not understand any 
expressions used by man, only the sense lying behind those expressions; nor to understand that sense do they employ the natural thoughts that are men's, only their own thoughts, which are spiritual 
ones. The transformation of the natural sense residing with man into that spiritual sense takes place instantaneously, like a person's immediate conversion of someone else's language into his own which 
is a different one. It is in that kind of way that the natural sense proper to man's thought is converted into the spiritual sense; for spiritual language or speech belongs properly to angels, but natural 
language properly to man. The reason for the immediate transformation of the one sort of language into the other is that a correspondence exists between every single thing in the natural world 
and every single thing in the spiritual world. </p>
<p></p>
<p><b>[3]</b>
 Now because the internal sense of the Word exists primarily for the benefit of those in the spiritual world, the kinds of details contained here in 
the internal sense that have been mentioned are ones that exist for their benefit and give them pleasure and delight. But the more internal those details are the further removed they are from the range 
of understanding present in men, for whom none but matters of a worldly and bodily nature bring pleasure and delight. When this is the situation they consider the spiritual matters contained in the 
internal sense as of little value; indeed they loathe them. Let anyone examine himself to see whether or not the ideas contained in the internal sense of the narrative that follows below are to him 
worthless and loathsome. Yet such ideas are what give angelic communities utmost delight. From this anyone who stops to reflect may also see the kind of difference there is between men's delights and 
angels' delights, as well as what it is that angels consider wisdom to consist in and what it is that men consider it to consist in. That is to say, angels consider wisdom to consist in the kinds of things 
that man regards as being worthless and that he is averse to, while man considers wisdom to consist in the kinds of things in which angels have no interest at all; indeed many people consider it 
to consist in the kinds of things which angels cast aside and have nothing to do with. </p>

`Quod adducti domum Josephi': quod significet quod vera quae naturalis, adjungerentur et subjicerentur interno, constat a significatione `adduci domum Josephi' quod sit conjungi et subjici interno; 
per `Josephum' enim repraesentatur internum, quia verum a Divino, seu caeleste spiritualis, de qua n. 5307, 5331, 5332, 5417, 5469; et per 'domum' significatur tam internum hominis quam externum ejus, 
n. 3128, 3538, 4973, 5023, hic internum quia dicitur `domus Josephi'; et per `adduci', nempe ad internum, significatur adjungi, et quia adjungi, significatur subjici; causa est quia naturale cum adjungitur 
interno, tunc ei subjicitur, imperium enim quod prius fuerat naturali homini, fit dein spirituali; de quo imperio in sequentibus, ex Divina Domini misericordia, dicetur. [2]Paucis dicendum quomodo 
se habet cum sensu interno:  Verbi sensus internus est imprimis pro illis qui in altera vita; illi qui ibi, cum apud hominem sunt qui legit Verbum, percipiunt illud secundum sensum internum, non autem 
secundum sensum externum, nullas enim voces humanas intelligunt sed solum sensum vocum, et hunc non secundum cogitationes hominis naturales sed secundum suas cogitationes quae spirituales; in spiritualem 
hunc sensum transmutatur ilico sensus naturalis qui apud hominem; se habet hoc sicut qui linguam alius vertit in suam quae alia, quod fit subito; ita sensus cogitationis humanae naturalis in 
spiritualem, spiritualis enim lingua seu loquela est angelis propria, naturalis autem homini; quod tam subita transmutatio unius quasi linguae in {1}alteram, est quia est correspondentia omnium et singulorum 
quae in mundo naturali cum illis quae in mundo spirituali.  [3]Nunc quia sensus internus Verbi imprimis est pro illis qui in spirituali mundo, idcirco talia hic in sensu interno memorantur quae 
pro illis sunt et quae illis amoena et jucunda; at quo interiora talia sunt, eo remotiora sunt a captu hominum, quibus illa quae mundi et corporis sunt, modo amoena et jucunda sunt; et cum ita, spiritualia 
quae sensus interni sunt, pro vili habent et quoque fastidiunt; exploret {2}quisque apud se, annon ei nauci et fastidio {3}sint quae in sensu interno in his quae nunc sequuntur, continentur, cum 
tamen talia sunt quibus societates angelicae quam maxime delectantur; inde quoque reflectenti patere potest, {4}quale discrimen est inter jucunda hominum et jucunda angelorum, tum in quibus angeli 
ponunt sapientiam et in quibus homines, quod nempe angeli ponant sapientiam in talibus quae homo nauci habet et aversatur, et quod homo sapientiam ponat in talibus quae angeli prorsus non curant, et plures 
in talibus quae angeli rejiciunt et fugiunt.   @1 alterius$ @2 id qui libet$ @3 after nauci$ @4 discrimen, quodnam$ </p>
