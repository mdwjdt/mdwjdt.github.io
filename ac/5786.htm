<h3 align="center" class="ired">属天的奥秘 第5786节</h3>
<h4 align="center"></h4><p><strong>5786.</strong>“看哪，我们是我主的奴仆”表他们将永远被剥夺自己的自由。这从“奴仆”的含义清楚可知，“奴仆”是指没有他们自己的自由（参看<a href="5760.htm">5760</a>，<a href="5763.htm">5763</a>节）。什么叫被剥夺人自己的自由，这在刚才所引用的章节已经说明；但由于这是一个极其重要的问题，故有必要重申一下。人既有一个外在人，也有一个内在人。外在人是内在人行动所藉由的手段；因为外在人只是内在人的器官或工具。既然如此，那么外在人必完全从属并顺服于内在人；当外在人顺服于内在人时，天堂便通过内在人作用于外在人，并使外在人顺应诸如属于天堂的那类事物。<br />当外在人不顺服作仆人，反而掌权作主人时，情况正好相反。当一个人以身体和感官的快感为他的目的，尤其以爱自己爱世界的快乐，而非天堂的快乐为目的，也就是以爱这一个不爱那一个为目的时，外在人就是主人。因为当一个人以这类事物为目的时，他就不再相信还有什么内在人这回事，也不相信等到肉体死亡时，他自己里面还有什么东西会活着。他的内在人因没有掌权作主人，故只是外在人的仆人，服侍它以使它能思考和推理反对良善和真理，因为在这种情况下，经由内在人而来的其它流注得不到。这也是为什么像这样的人完全鄙视天堂的事物，甚至对它们退避三舍的原因。由此明显可知，等同于属世人的外在人应当完全顺服于内在人或属灵人，因而不可有它自己的任何自由。<br />人自己的自由在于放纵自己沉溺于各种低级乐趣，与自己相比蔑视他人，使他们像奴隶一样顺服于自己；或者迫害、仇恨他人，对着他们幸灾乐祸，尤其以利用人自己的伎俩或欺骗手段向他们所做的事为乐，希望看到他们死。这些事就是放纵人自己的自由所导致的后果。由此可见，当人处于这种自由时，他像什么样子，就是一个人形的魔鬼。不过，当失去这种自由时，他就会从主那里接受天上的自由；这种自由的性质完全不为那些处于人自己的自由之人所知。这些人以为，如果他们自己的自由被夺走，他们根本不会有生命存留。而事实上，这时，真生命本身才刚刚开始；真正的欢喜、快乐、幸福，以及智慧才到来，因为这自由来自主。</p>

Behold we are servants to my lord. That this signifies that they are forever to be deprived of freedom of their own, is evident from the signification of "servants," as being to be without freedom from 
their own (see n. 5760, 5763). What it is to be deprived of freedom from their own has also been told in the numbers cited; but as this is a matter of the greatest moment, it shall be stated again. 
There is an external man, and there is an internal; the external man is that through which the internal acts; for the external is only an organ or instrument of the internal. This being so, the external 
must be wholly subordinate and subject to the internal; and when it is subject, heaven acts through the internal into the external, and disposes it according to such things as are of heaven. [2] 
The contrary takes place when the external is not subject, but rules, as it does when the man has as his end the pleasures of the body and of the senses, especially those of the love of self and the world, 
and not those of heaven. To have as the end is to love the one and not the other; for when a man has such things as the end, he no longer believes that there is any internal man, nor that there 
is anything in himself which is to live when the body dies. For his internal, not having rule, merely serves the external to enable it to think and reason against good and truth, because in this case 
no other influx through the internal is open. For this reason it is that such persons wholly despise, and even turn away from, the things that are of heaven. From these things it is clear that the external 
man, which is the same as the natural man, ought to be entirely subject to the internal which is spiritual, and consequently to be without freedom from its own. [3] Freedom from one's own is to 
indulge in pleasures of every kind, to despise others in comparison with oneself, to subject them to oneself as servants, or else to persecute and hate them, to delight in evils that befall them, and 
more so in those which the man himself brings on them purposely or deceitfully, and to desire their death. Such are the results of freedom from one's own. It is plain therefore what a man is when he 
is in this freedom, namely, a devil in human form. But when he loses this freedom, he then receives from the Lord heavenly freedom, which is utterly unknown to those who are in freedom from their own. 
These suppose that if the latter freedom were taken away from them, they would have no life left; when in fact life itself then begins; and joy, bliss, happiness, with wisdom, then come, because this 
freedom is from the Lord. </p>

<p align="center"><b>Elliott(1983-1999) 5786</b></p><p><b>5786.</b>
'behold, we are my lord's slaves' means that they are to be deprived for ever of their own freedom. This is clear from the meaning of slaves' as being without any freedom of their own, dealt with in <a href="5760.htm">5760</a>, <a href="5763.htm">5763</a>. What is meant by being deprived of the freedom of one's own has also been stated in the paragraphs that have just been mentioned; however, since it is an extremely important matter, let it 
be restated. A person has both an external man and an internal man. The external man is the means through which the internal man acts; for the external man is merely the organ or instrument of the internal. 
This being so, the external man must be made wholly subservient and subject to the internal; and when the external man is subject to the internal, heaven acts on the external man by means of the 
internal man and makes the external man conform to things such as are of heaven. </p>
<p></p>
<p><b>[2]</b>
 The opposite occurs when the external man is not the servant but the master. The external man is the master when 
a person has the pleasure of the body and the senses as his end in view, especially when the objects of his selfish and worldly love and not the things of heaven are his end - to have as his end in 
view being to love one and not the other. For when a person has those objects as his end he no longer believes that there is any such thing as an internal man or that within himself there is anything 
that will be living when his body dies. In his case the internal, since it does not hold the position of the master, is merely the servant of the external, employed to enable thought and reasoning against 
what is good and true to take place; for in this person's case no other kind of influx by way of the internal is available. This is also the reason why people like this utterly despise, indeed 
recoil from the things of heaven. From all this it is plain that the external man, which is the same as the natural man, ought to be wholly subject to the internal or spiritual man, and consequently should 
exist without any freedom of its own. </p>
<p></p>
<p><b>[3]</b>
 Freedom of one's own consists in giving oneself up to every kind of base pleasure, despising others in comparison with oneself, and making them subject 
like slaves to oneself. Or else it consists in persecuting others, hating them, being delighted when bad things happen to them - especially things done to them by one's own designs or by the use of 
deceit - and wishing to see them dead. These are the kinds of things that come from indulging one's own freedom. From this one may see what a person is like when he exercises this type of freedom, namely 
a devil in human form. But when he loses this freedom he receives a heavenly freedom from the Lord, the nature of which is completely unknown to those exercising the freedom of their own. They imagine 
that if the freedom of their own were taken away from them no life at all would remain. But in actual fact this is when true life has its beginning and when true delight, blessing, happiness, and 
wisdom arrive, because this freedom comes from the Lord. </p>

`Ecce nos servi domino meo':  quod significet quod privandi libero proprio in perpetuum, constat ex significatione 'servorum' quod sit esse absque libero ex proprio, de qua n. 5760, 5763; quid sit privari 
libero ex proprio, in locis nunc citatis etiam dictum, at quia hoc maximi momenti est, iterum dicendum: homo est externus et est internus; homo externus est per (x)quem agit internus, est enim 
externus modo organum seu instrumentum interni; et quia ita, erit externus prorsus subordinatus et subjectus interno; cum subjectus est, tunc caelum per internum agit in externum et disponit illum ad 
talia quae caeli sunt; [2] contrarium fit cum externus non subjectus est sed dominatur; et tunc dominatur externus cum homo pro fine habet voluptates corporis et sensuum, {1}imprimis cum illa quae {2}sunt 
amoris sui et mundi, non autem illa quae sunt caeli; pro fine habere est amare {3}unum et non alterum; nam cum {4}talia pro fine habet, tunc nec credit amplius quod aliquis internus homo detur, nec 
quod in se ipso sit quod victurum cum moritur corpus; nam internum ejus, quia absque (x)dominatu, solum inservit externo ut cogitare et ratiocinari possit contra bonum et verum, {5}tunc enim influxus 
per internum non patet alius; inde etiam est quod tales prorsus contemnant, immo aversentur illa quae caeli sunt; ex his liquet quod externus homo, qui idem est cum naturali homine, debeat prorsus 
subjectus esse interno qui spiritualis, consequenter esse absque libero ex proprio. [3] Liberum ex proprio est indulgere voluptatibus quibuscumque, contemnere alios prae se, eos sibi subjicere ut servos; 
sin aliter eos persequi, odio habere, delectari malis quae eis contingunt, et magis quae ipse illis studio {6}aut dolo infert, illorum mortem cupere; talia sunt (c)a libero ex proprio; inde patet 
qualis homo est cum in illo, quod nempe {7} diabolus sub forma humana. At vero cum amittit hoc liberum, tunc accipit a Domino liberum caeleste, quod prorsus non sciunt quid sit, qui in libero ex proprio 
sunt; putant {8}hi si hoc liberum illis auferretur, quod nihil vitae supersit, cum tamen tunc ipsa vita incipit et tunc ipsum jucundum, beatum, felix, cum sapientia, venit, quia hoc liberum est a Domino. @1 
tum pro fine$ @2 after mundi$ @3 illa quae caeli sunt contemnere, imo negare, nec agnoscere aliud bonum quam quod est amoris sui et mundi, ita malum$ @4 illa$ @5 nam$ @6 ac dolo inducit$ @7 
i sit$ @8 enim$ </p>
