<h3 align="center" class="ired">属天的奥秘 第6367节</h3>
<h4 align="center"></h4><p><strong>6367.</strong>“犹大是个狮子的幼崽”表具有天生力量的纯真。这从“狮子”的含义清楚可知，“狮子”是指在其能力中的爱之良善和源于那良善的真理，如下文所述；因此，“狮子的幼崽”是指具有力量的纯真。之所以“具有天生力量”，是因为“犹大”在此代表爱的属天元素，爱的属天元素居于心智的意愿部分（参看<a href="895.htm">895</a>，<a href="927.htm">927</a>，<a href="4493.htm">4493</a>，<a href="5113.htm">5113</a>节），因而拥有天生的力量。事实上，人生在属意愿部分的事物中；正因如此，属天的上古教会成员照着良善存在于其意愿中的程度而生在爱之良善中。这就是为何说这力量是“天生的”。“狮子的幼崽”之所以表示纯真，是因为“狮子”表示属天之爱的良善，“幼崽”可以说是它的婴孩，由此表示纯真。<br />“狮子”表示在其能力中的属天之爱的良善和源于那爱的真理，在反面意义上表示在其能力中的自我之爱的邪恶；这一点从圣言中提及“狮子”的经文明显看出来。它表示属天之爱的良善，这明显可见于启示录：<br />看哪，犹大支派中的狮子，大卫的根，他已得胜，能展开那书卷，揭开那七印。（启示录<a href="http://39-27.cn/启5.5.htm">5:5</a>）<br />此处主被称为“狮子”，凭的是属于祂的神性之爱和那爱所拥有的神性真理的全能。在圣言的其它经文中，耶和华或主被比作“狮子”，如何西阿书：<br />他们必跟随祂；祂必像狮子吼叫；祂一吼叫，子女就从西方战兢而来。（何西阿书<a href="http://39-27.cn/何11.10.htm">11:10</a>）<br />以赛亚书：<br />耶和华对我如此说，狮子和少壮狮子怎样为猎物而咆哮，满数的牧人上来攻击他的时候，他不因他们的声音惊惶，也不因他们的喧哗受苦，照样，万军之耶和华也必降临在锡安山和它的山冈上争战。（以赛亚书<a href="http://39-27.cn/赛31.4.htm">31:4</a>）<br />此处神性良善的全能被比作“狮子”，源于那良善的神性真理的全能被比作“少壮狮子”，因为经上说：“万军之耶和华也必降临在锡安山和它的山冈上争战”；“锡安山”表示神性之爱的良善，“它的山冈”表示源于那良善的神性真理（参看<a href="795.htm">795</a>，<a href="796.htm">796</a>，<a href="1430.htm">1430</a>，<a href="4210.htm">4210</a>节）。<br />由于同样的原因，以西结书和启示录中表示基路伯的四活物有人、狮子、牛和鹰的脸。以西结书：<br />至于四活物的脸的形像：四个各有人的脸，右面有狮子的脸；四个左面有牛的脸；四个各有鹰的脸。（以西结书<a href="http://39-27.cn/结1.10.htm">1:10</a>；<a href="http://39-27.cn/结10.14.htm">10:14</a>）<br />启示录：<br />宝座前有四个活物，前后都长满了眼睛。第一个活物像狮子，第二个活物像牛犊，第三个活物脸面像人，第四个活物像飞鹰。（启示录<a href="http://39-27.cn/启4.6.htm">4:6</a>，<a href="http://39-27.cn/启4.7.htm">7</a>）<br />这些活物是基路伯，这一点在以西结书（10章）有所说明，也可从启示录中对它们的描述，即它们前后都有眼睛明显看出来；因为“基路伯”表示主的预见和提供（<a href="308.htm">308</a>节）；它们有狮子的脸，凭的是属于神性良善所拥有的神性真理的全能。新殿周围的基路伯（以西结书<a href="http://39-27.cn/结41.19.htm">41:19</a>）也是如此。<br />拥有来自主的良善和源于这良善的真理所提供的能力之人由“狮子”来表示，这明显可见于诗篇：<br />敬畏耶和华的一无所缺。少壮狮子还缺乏忍饿；但寻求耶和华的，什么好处都不缺。（诗篇<a href="http://39-27.cn/诗34.9.htm">34:9</a>，<a href="http://39-27.cn/诗34.10.htm">10</a>）<br /><br />狮子吼叫，要抓食，向神寻求食物。日头一出，它们就聚集，躺卧在它们的住处。（诗篇<a href="http://39-27.cn/诗104.21.htm">104:21</a>，<a href="http://39-27.cn/诗104.22.htm">22</a>）<br />在巴兰的预言中：<br />到那时，必有人论及雅各，就是论及以色列说，神为他行了何等的大事！看哪，这民起来仿佛老狮，挺身好像少壮狮子；未曾吃猎物，决不躺卧。（民数记<a href="http://39-27.cn/民23.23.htm">23:23</a>，<a href="http://39-27.cn/民23.24.htm">24</a>）<br /><br />巴兰看见以色列人照着支派居住，他说，祂屈身躺着像狮子，如一只老狮子，谁敢惹他？（民数记<a href="http://39-27.cn/民24.2.htm">24:2</a>，<a href="http://39-27.cn/民24.9.htm">9</a>）<br />此处描述的是属天的秩序，因为这是当巴兰看见以色列人照着支派居住时，他在灵里所看见各支派安营所代表的属天秩序（参看<a href="6335.htm">6335</a>节）。这种秩序源于从主经由神性真理而来的神性良善；此处由“屈身躺着的狮子”所代表的一切能力都居于这秩序里面。<br />弥迦书：<br />雅各余剩的人必在列族中，在多民中间，如森林百兽中的狮子，又如少壮狮子在羊群中。他若经过，就必践踏撕裂，无人搭救。愿你的手举起，高过你敌人！（弥迦书<a href="http://39-27.cn/弥5.8.htm">5:8</a>，<a href="http://39-27.cn/弥5.9.htm">9</a>）<br />此处“狮子”和“少壮狮子”表示属天良善和属天真理，就是“雅各余剩的人”。它们在以下经文也表示这良善与真理：以赛亚书21:8；耶利米书25:38；以西结书32:2；撒迦利亚书11:3。所罗门象牙宝座上的狮子，宝座两旁的两个，六层台阶上的十二个（列王记上<a href="http://39-27.cn/王上10.18.htm">10:18</a>-<a href="http://39-27.cn/王上10.20.htm">20</a>），以及十铜盆座边上的狮子（列王记上<a href="http://39-27.cn/王上7.29.htm">7:29</a>，<a href="http://39-27.cn/王上7.36.htm">36</a>）同样代表这良善与真理。<br />就反面意义而言，“狮子”表示在其能力中自我之爱的邪恶，这一点从以下经文明显看出来：<br />在那里必没有狮子，猛兽也不上去；在那里都遇不见；只有他们在那里自由行走；因此，耶和华救赎的人必返回，歌唱来到锡安。（以赛亚书<a href="http://39-27.cn/赛35.9.htm">35:9</a>，<a href="http://39-27.cn/赛35.10.htm">10</a>）<br />耶利米书：<br />以色列为何成为掠物呢？少壮狮子向他咆哮，发出大声，使他的地，使他的地荒凉。（耶利米书<a href="http://39-27.cn/耶2.14.htm">2:14</a>，<a href="http://39-27.cn/耶2.15.htm">15</a>）<br /><br />有狮子从密林中上来，有毁坏列族的已经起身，他从他的地方出发，要使地荒凉。（耶利米书<a href="http://39-27.cn/耶4.7.htm">4:7</a>）<br /><br />他们不晓得耶和华的道路和他们神的法则。因此，森林中的狮子必扑杀他们，原野上的豺狼必灭绝他们。（耶利米书<a href="http://39-27.cn/耶5.4.htm">5:4</a>，<a href="http://39-27.cn/耶5.6.htm">6</a>）<br />那鸿书：<br />狮子的住处和少壮狮子喂养之处在哪里呢？狮子、母狮、小狮子的幼崽游行，无人惊吓之地在哪里呢？狮子撕碎的足够给他的幼崽，掐死的，足够给祂的老母狮，把撕碎的、掐死的充满它的洞穴。把猎物塞满他的洞穴，把撕碎的装满他的住处。万军之耶和华说，看哪，我必攻击你，我要把她的战车焚烧成烟，剑必吞灭你的幼狮；我必从地上除去你的猎物。（那鸿书<a href="http://39-27.cn/鸿2.11.htm">2:11</a>-<a href="http://39-27.cn/鸿2.13.htm">13</a>）<br />这论及尼尼微。在上述经文中，“狮子”表示自我之爱的邪恶在毁灭并荒凉时所拥有的能力；在以下经文中也是如此：耶利米书12:8；49:19；50:17，44；51:38；以西结书19:2-11；33:2；约珥书1:6；西番雅书 3:3；诗篇57:5；58:6；91:13；启示录13:2。</p>

<p align="center"><b>Potts(1905-1910) 6367</b></p><p><b>6367.</b>
Judah is a lion's whelp. That this signifies innocence with innate forces, is evident from the signification of a "lion," as being the good of love and the truth thence derived in their power (of which 
in what follows); thus a "lion's whelp" denotes innocence with forces. The reason why it is said "with innate forces" is that "Judah" here is the celestial of love, and the celestial of love is in 
the will part (see n. 895, 927, 4493, 5113), thus it has innate forces; for man is born into the things of the will part; hence they of the Most Ancient Church, which was celestial, were born into the 
good of love insofar as they had good in their will. From this then it is that the forces are said to be "innate." The reason why a "lion's whelp" denotes innocence, is that a "lion" denotes the good 
of celestial love, and a "whelp" is as it were its infant, thus is innocence. [2] That a "lion" denotes the good of celestial love and the derivative truth, in its power, and also that in the opposite 
sense it denotes the evil of the love of self in its power, is evident from passages in the Word where a "lion" is mentioned. That it denotes the good of celestial love is evident in John: </p>
<p>     Behold 
the lion that is of the tribe of Judah, the root of David, hath conquered to open the book, and to loose the seven seals thereof (Rev. 5:5); </p>
<p>here the Lord is called a "lion" from the omnipotence 
belonging to His Divine love and the Divine truth thence derived. In other passages in the Word, Jehovah or the Lord is compared to a "lion," as in Hosea: </p>
<p>     They shall go after Jehovah; He shall 
roar like a lion; for He shall roar, and the sons shall come with honor from the sea (Hos. 11:10). [3] In Isaiah: </p>
<p>     Thus said Jehovah unto me, Like as when the lion roareth, and the young lion over 
his prey, if a fullness of shepherds come running upon him, he is not dismayed at their voice, and is not afflicted by their tumult; so shall Jehovah Zebaoth come down to fight upon Mount Zion and 
upon the hill thereof (Isa. 31:4);  here the omnipotence of Divine good is compared to a "lion," and the omnipotence of the Divine truth thence derived is compared to a "young lion," for it is said that 
"Jehovah Zebaoth shall come down to fight upon Mount Zion and upon the hill thereof;" for "Mount Zion" signifies the good of Divine love, and the "hill thereof," the Divine truth thence derived (see 
n. 795, 796, 1430, 4210). [4] For the same reason the four animals in Ezekiel and in John, by which are meant cherubs, had the faces of a man, a lion, an ox, and an eagle. In Ezekiel: </p>
<p>     The likeness 
of the faces of the four animals: the face of a man and the face of a lion on the right side had they four; and they four had the face of an ox on the left side; and they four had the face of an 
eagle (Ezek. 1:10; 10:14). And in Revelation: </p>
<p>     Before the throne were four animals full of eyes before and behind. And the first animal was like a lion, and the second animal like a calf, the 
third animal had a face as a man, the fourth animal was like a flying eagle (Rev. 4:6, 7). That these animals were cherubs is said in Ezekiel 10, and is also plain from the description of them in John, 
namely, that they had eyes before and behind; for by "cherubs" are signified the Lord's foresight and providence (n. 308); that they had the face of a lion was from the omnipotence of Divine truth 
from Divine good, which is of providence. It was similar with the cherubs about the new temple, in Ezekiel 41:19. [5] That the celestial, who are in power from good and the derivative truth, which are 
from the Lord, are meant by "lions," is evident in David: </p>
<p>     There is no want to them that fear Jehovah. The young lions do lack, and suffer hunger; but they that seek Jehovah shall not want any 
good (Ps. 34:9, 10). Again: </p>
<p>     The lions roar after their prey, and to seek their food from God. The sun ariseth, they are gathered together, and lay them down in their habitations (Ps. 104:21, 22). </p>
<p>And 
in the prophecy of Balaam: </p>
<p>     At that time it shall be said to Jacob and Israel, What hath God wrought! Behold the people shall rise up as an old lion, and as a young lion shall he lift himself 
up; he shall not rest until he eat the prey (Num. 23:23, 24). [6] And again: </p>
<p>     When Balaam saw Israel dwelling according to their tribes, he said, He boweth down, he coucheth as a lion, and 
as an old lion, who shall rouse him up? (Num. 24:2, 9). It is the celestial that is here described, because it was the celestial order that the tribes represented by their encampment which Balaam saw 
in spirit when he saw Israel dwelling according to their tribes (see n. 6335). This order is from the Divine good through the Divine truth from the Lord, and in this order is all power, here denoted 
by the "lion which boweth down and coucheth." [7] In Micah: </p>
<p>     The remains of Jacob shall be among the nations, in the midst of many peoples, as a lion among the beasts of the forest, as a young 
lion among the flocks of sheep; who if he go through, treadeth down and scattereth, and there is none rescuing. Let thy hand be exalted over thine enemies, and let all thy foes be cut off (Mic. 5:8, 
9); </p>
<p>where the "lion" and "young lion" denote celestial good and celestial truth, which are the "remains of Jacob." The meaning is similar in Isa. 21:8; Jer. 25:38; Ezek. 32:2; Zech. 11:3. The like was 
represented by the lions at the ivory throne of Solomon, two at the sides of the throne, and twelve upon the six steps (1 Kings 10:18-20); also by the lions upon the borders of the ten bases of brass 
(1 Kings 7:29, 36). [8] That in the opposite sense a "lion" signifies the evil of the love of self in its power, is plain from the following passages: </p>
<p>     No lion shall be there, and no ravenous 
beast shall go up thereon, it shall not be found there; but they shall go free; thus the redeemed of Jehovah shall return and shall come to Zion with singing (Isa. 35:9, 10). In Jeremiah: </p>
<p>     Why is 
Israel become a prey? The young lions roar against him, they utter their voice, they reduce his land to a waste (Jer. 2:14, 15). Again: </p>
<p>     The lion cometh up from his bramble, and the destroyer 
of the nations hath journeyed, he went forth from his place to reduce the land into a waste (Jer. 4:7). Again: </p>
<p>     They have not known the way of Jehovah, the judgment of their God. Wherefore a lion 
out of the forest hath smitten them, and a wolf of the plains will lay them waste (Jer. 5:4, 6). And in Nahum: </p>
<p>     Where is the habitation of the lions, and the pasture of the young lions; where 
the lion stalked, the old lion, the lion's whelp, and none made afraid? The lion seizeth enough for his whelps, and strangleth for His old lionesses, and filleth his caves with prey, and his habitations 
with ravin. Behold I am against thee, saith Jehovah Zebaoth, and I will burn her chariot in the smoke, and the sword shall devour thy young lions; and I will cut off thy prey from the earth (Nah. 2:11-13); </p>
<p>speaking 
of Nineveh. In the above passages a "lion" denotes the power possessed by the evil of the love of self when it destroys and lays waste; and so in Jer. 12:8; 49:19; 50:17, 44; 51:38; 
Ezek. 19:2-11; 33:2; Joel 1:6; Zeph. 3:3; Ps. 57:5; 58:6; 91:13; Rev. 13:2. </p>

<p align="center"><b>Elliott(1983-1999) 6367</b></p><p><b>6367.</b>
'A lion's cub is Judah' means innocence with innate strength. This is clear from the meaning of 'a lion' as the good of love and the truth from that good in their power, dealt with below, so that 'a 
lion's cub' is innocence with strength. The reason why with innate strength is meant is that here 'Judah' represents the celestial element of love, and the celestial element of love resides in the will 
part of the mind, <a href="895.htm">895</a>, <a href="917.htm">917</a>, <a href="4493.htm">4493</a>, <a href="5117.htm">5117</a>, and thus possesses innate strength. For a person is born into things that belong to the will part. That being so, members of the Most Ancient Church, which was 
celestial, were born into the good of love, in the measure that good was present in their will. This then is why the strength is said to be innate. The reason 'a lion's cub' means innocence is that 
'a lion' is the good of celestial love, and 'a cub', being so to speak its young child, accordingly means innocence. </p>
<p></p>
<p><b>[2]</b>
 'A lion' means the good of celestial love and the truth from that love in their 
power, and also in the contrary sense the evil of self-love in its power, as is clear from places in the Word where 'a lion' is mentioned. The good of celestial love is meant in John, </p>
<blockquote>
Behold, the 
Lion which is from the Tribe of Judah, the root of David, has prevailed to open the book and to loose its seven seals. <a href="http://bible.gospelcom.net/cgi-bin/bible?passage=Rev%205:5&amp;version=ESV&amp;interface=print&amp;showfn=yes&amp;showxref">Rev 5:5</a>. 
</blockquote>
<p>Here the Lord is called 'the Lion' by virtue of the almighty power 
which His Divine Love and Divine Truth from that Love possess. There are also other places in the Word where Jehovah or the Lord is compared to a lion, as in Hosea, </p>
<blockquote>
They will go after Jehovah; He 
will roar like a lion, for He will roar, and respectfully [His] sons from the west<A name="fntext1"></a><A href="#fn1"><sup>a</sup></a> will draw near. <a href="http://bible.gospelcom.net/cgi-bin/bible?passage=Hosea%2011:10&amp;version=ESV&amp;interface=print&amp;showfn=yes&amp;showxref">Hosea 11:10</a>. 
</blockquote>
<p></p>
<p><b>[3]</b>
 Also in Isaiah, </p>
<blockquote>
Thus said Jehovah to me, As a lion roars, and a young lion over 
its prey, when there come up against him a full number of shepherds, by whose voice he is not dismayed, and by whose tumult he is not distressed, so Jehovah Zebaoth will come down to fight on Mount 
Zion and on its hill. <a href="http://bible.gospelcom.net/cgi-bin/bible?passage=Isa%2031:4&amp;version=ESV&amp;interface=print&amp;showfn=yes&amp;showxref">Isa 31:4</a>.  
</blockquote>
<p>Here the almighty power of Divine Good is compared to 'a lion', and the almighty power of Divine Truth from that Good is compared to 'a young lion'. For it says 
that 'Jehovah Zebaoth will come down to fight on Mount Zion and on its hill', and 'Mount Zion' means the Good of Divine Love and 'its hill' the Divine Truth from that Good, <a href="795.htm">795</a>, <a href="796.htm">796</a>, <a href="1430.htm">1430</a>, <a href="4210.htm">4210</a>. </p>
<p></p>
<p><b>[4]</b>
For the same reason the four living creatures in Ezekiel and in John, meaning cherubs, had the faces of a human being, lion, ox, and eagle: In Ezekiel, </p>
<blockquote>
The likeness of the faces of the four living 
creatures - [each of] the four had the face of a human being, and the face of a lion on the right side, and [each of] the four had the face of an ox on the left side, and [each of] the four had the 
face of an eagle. <a href="http://bible.gospelcom.net/cgi-bin/bible?passage=Ezek%201:10;%2010:14&amp;version=ESV&amp;interface=print&amp;showfn=yes&amp;showxref">Ezek 1:10; 10:14</a>. 
</blockquote>
<p>And in John, </p>
<blockquote>
Around<A name="fntext2"></a><A href="#fn2"><sup>b</sup></a> the throne were four living creatures full of eyes in front and behind. And the first living creature was like a lion; the second living 
creature was like a calf; the third living creature had a face like a human being; the fourth living creature was like a flying eagle. <a href="http://bible.gospelcom.net/cgi-bin/bible?passage=Rev%204:6,%207&amp;version=ESV&amp;interface=print&amp;showfn=yes&amp;showxref">Rev 4:6, 7</a>. 
</blockquote>
<p>The fact that the living creatures were cherubs 
is stated in Ezekiel to, which fact is also evident from the description of them in John, in which he says that they had 'eyes in front and behind'. The Lord's foresight and providence are meant by 'the 
cherubs', <a href="308.htm">308</a>; and they had the face of a lion by virtue of the almighty power belonging to providence that Divine Truth from Divine Good possesses. So also with the cherubs around the new temple 
in <a href="http://bible.gospelcom.net/cgi-bin/bible?passage=Ezekiel%2041:19&amp;version=ESV&amp;interface=print&amp;showfn=yes&amp;showxref">Ezekiel 41:19</a>. </p>
<p></p>
<p><b>[5]</b>
 Celestial people in possession of the power supplied by the good and the truth from good which come from the Lord are meant by 'lions', as is evident in David, </p>
<blockquote>
There is no 
want to those fearing Jehovah. The young lions will lack and suffer hunger, but those seeking Jehovah will not lack any good thing. <a href="http://bible.gospelcom.net/cgi-bin/bible?passage=Ps%2034:9,%2010&amp;version=ESV&amp;interface=print&amp;showfn=yes&amp;showxref">Ps 34:9, 10</a>. 
</blockquote>
<p>In the same author, </p>
<blockquote>
The [young] lions are roaring 
for plunder, and to seek from God their food. The sun rises, they are gathered together, and lie down in their dwelling-places. <a href="http://bible.gospelcom.net/cgi-bin/bible?passage=Ps%20104:21,%2022&amp;version=ESV&amp;interface=print&amp;showfn=yes&amp;showxref">Ps 104:21, 22</a>. 
</blockquote>
<p>In Balaam's prophetic utterance, </p>
<blockquote>
At that time it 
will be said to Jacob and to Israel, What has God been doing? See, a people will rise up like an old lion, and like a young lion will lift itself up. He will not rest until he has devoured the prey. 
<a href="http://bible.gospelcom.net/cgi-bin/bible?passage=Num%2023:23,%2024&amp;version=ESV&amp;interface=print&amp;showfn=yes&amp;showxref">Num 23:23, 24</a>. 
</blockquote>
<p></p>
<p><b>[6]</b>
 And further on, </p>
<blockquote>
When Balaam saw Israel dwelling according to their tribes, he said, He crouches, he lies down like a lion, and like an old lion; who will rouse him? <a href="http://bible.gospelcom.net/cgi-bin/bible?passage=Num%2024:2,%209&amp;version=ESV&amp;interface=print&amp;showfn=yes&amp;showxref">Num 24:2, 9</a>. 
</blockquote>
<p>The celestial is what is described here because celestial order is what the tribes represented by their encampments and was what Balaam saw in the spirit when he saw Israel dwelling according 
to their tribes, <a href="6335.htm">6335</a>. That order originates in Divine Good coming through Divine Truth from the Lord; and within that order resides all power, meant here by a crouching and recumbent lion. </p>
<p></p>
<p><b>[7]</b>
 In 
Micah, </p>
<blockquote>

<p>Here 'a lion' and a young lion 
stand for celestial good and celestial truth, which are 'the remnant of Jacob'. They also stand for that good and truth in <a href="http://bible.gospelcom.net/cgi-bin/bible?passage=Isaiah%2021:8&amp;version=ESV&amp;interface=print&amp;showfn=yes&amp;showxref">Isaiah 21:8</a>; <a href="http://bible.gospelcom.net/cgi-bin/bible?passage=Jer%2025:38&amp;version=ESV&amp;interface=print&amp;showfn=yes&amp;showxref">Jer 25:38</a>; <a href="http://bible.gospelcom.net/cgi-bin/bible?passage=Ezek%2038:13&amp;version=ESV&amp;interface=print&amp;showfn=yes&amp;showxref">Ezek 38:13</a>; <a href="http://bible.gospelcom.net/cgi-bin/bible?passage=Zech%2011:3&amp;version=ESV&amp;interface=print&amp;showfn=yes&amp;showxref">Zech 11:3</a>. And that same good and truth 
were also represented by the lions at Solomon's ivory throne, two next to the armrests<A name="fntext4"></a><A href="#fn4"><sup>d</sup></a> and twelve on the six steps, <a href="1.htm">1</a> Kings 10:18-20, and by the lions on the panels of the ten pedestals made of 
bronze, <a href="1.htm">1</a> Kings 7:29, <a href="36.htm">36</a>. </p>
<p></p>
<p><b>[8]</b>
 In the contrary sense 'a lion' means the evil of self-love in its power, as is evident from the following places: In Isaiah, </p>
<p>There will not be any lion there, and 
the savage of the wild animals will not go up on it; it will not be found there. But they will go free; thus the redeemed of Jehovah will return, and will come to Zion with song. Isa. 35: <a href="9.htm">9</a>, <a href="10.htm">10</a>. </p>
<p>In 
Jeremiah, </p>
<p>Why has Israel become plunder? The young lions roar at him, they sound their voice; they turn his land into a waste. Jer. 2:14, <a href="15.htm">15</a>. </p>
<p>In the same prophet, </p>
<p>A lion has risen up from his 
thicket, and a destroyer of nations has set out; he has come from his place to turn the land into a waste. Jer. 4:7. </p>
<p>In the same prophet, </p>
<p>They did not know the way of Jehovah, the judgement of 
their God, therefore a lion from the forest has struck them down, and a wolf of the plains will devastate them. Jer. 5:4, <a href="6.htm">6</a>. </p>
<p>In Nahum, </p>
<p>Where is the dwelling-place of lions, and the feeding-place<A name="fntext5"></a><A href="#fn5"><sup>e</sup></a> 
of the young lions, where the lion walked, the old lion, the lion's cub, and there is no one making them afraid? The lion tears in pieces enough for the cubs, and strangles for his old lionesses, 
and fills his caves with plunder, and his dwelling places with what he has pounced on. Behold, I am against you, said Jehovah Zebaoth, and I will burn her chariot in the smoke; but the sword will 
devour your young lions, and I will cut off your plunder from the earth. Nahum 2:11-17. </p>
<p>This refers to Nineveh. </p>
<p>In all these places 'a lion' stands for the power that the evil of self-love possesses, 
when it destroys and lays waste. 'A lion' has a like meaning in Jer. 12:8; 49:19; 50:17, <a href="44.htm">44</a>; 51:38; Ezek. 19:2-9; 32:2; Joel 1:6; Zeph. 3:3; Ps. 57:4; 58:6; 91:13; Rev. 13:2.

`Catulus leonis Jehudah':  quod significet innocentiam cum viribus innatis, constat ex significatione `leonis' quod sit bonum  amoris et verum inde in sua potentia, de qua sequitur; ita `catulus leonis' 
est innocentia cum viribus; quod cum viribus innatis, est quia `Jehudah' hic est caeleste amoris, et caeleste amoris est in parte voluntaria, n. 895, 927, 4493, 5113, ita ei vires innatae; nam homo 
in illa quae sunt voluntariae partis, nascitur; inde illi qui ab Antiquissima Ecclesia quae erat caelestis, nati fuerunt in bonum amoris quoad tantum quantum boni in voluntario eorum fuit; ex eo nunc 
est quod vires dicantur innatae.  Quod `catulus leonis' sit innocentia, est quia `leo' est bonum amoris caelestis, et `catulus' est sicut infans ejus, ita innocentia.  [2]Quod `leo' sit bonum amoris 
caelestis et inde verum in sua potentia, tum quod in opposito sensu sit malum amoris sui in sua potentia, constat a locis in Verbo ubi leo nominatur; quod sit bonum amoris caelestis, apud Johannem, 	Ecce 
vicit leo qui est ex tribu Jehudae, radix Davidis, ut aperiat librum, et solvat septem sigilla ejus, Apoc. v 5; </p>
<p>ibi Dominus vocatur `Leo' ex omnipotentia quae est Ipsius Divino Amori et inde 
Divino Vero:  alibi etiam in Verbo Jehovah seu Dominus comparatur leoni, ut apud Hosheam, 	Post Jehovam ibunt, sicut leo rugiet, quia ille rugiet, et cum honore accedent filii a mari, xi 10: </p>
<p>[3]tum 
apud Esaiam, 	Sic dixit Jehovah ad me, Quemadmodum rugit leo, et juvenis leo super rapina sua, cum occurrit super eum plenitudo pastorum, a quorum voce non consternatur, et a tumultu eorum non affligitur, 
sic descendet Jehovah Zebaoth ad militandum super monte Zionis et super colle ejus, xxxi 4; </p>
<p>ibi omnipotentia Divini Boni comparatus `leoni', et omnipotentia Divini Veri inde comparatur `juveni 
leoni', nam dicitur quod `descendet Jehovah Zebaoth ad militandum super monte Zionis et super colle ejus'; `mons' enim `Zionis' significat Bonum Divini Amoris, et `collis ejus' Divinum Verum inde, n. 
795, 796, 1430, 4210.  [4]Propterea etiam `quatuor animalibus' apud Ezechielem et apud Johannem, per quae intelliguntur cherubi, `erant facies hominis, leonis, bovis et aquilae':  apud Ezechielem, 	Similitudo 
facierum quatuor animalium, facies hominis et  facies leonis ad dextrum quatuor illis, et facies bovis quatuor illis ad sinistrum, et facies aquilae quatuor illis, i 10, x 14:  et apud Johannem, 	Ante 
thronum quatuor animalia plena oculis ante et retro,  et primum animal simile leoni, alterum animal simile vitulo, tertium animal habens faciem sicut homo, quartum animal simile aquilae volanti, 
Apoc. iv 6, 7; </p>
<p>quod animalia illa fuerint cherubi, dicitur {1}apud Ezechielem x, et quoque patet a descriptione eorum apud Johannem, quod nempe `habuerint oculos ante et retro'; per `cherubos' 
enim significatur  praevidentia et providentia Domini, n. 308; quod `eis facies leonis' erat ex omnipotentia Divini Veri ex Divino Bono, quae providentiae; similiter cherubi circum novum templum apud 
Ezechielem xli 19.  [5]Quod caelestes qui in potentia sunt ex bono et inde vero, quae a Domino, intelligantur per `leones', patet apud Davidem, 	Non defectus timentibus Jehovam, leones juvenes egebunt 
 et esurient, sed quaerentes Jehovam non egebunt ullo bono,  Ps. xxxiv 10, 11 (A.V. 9, 10): </p>
<p>apud eundem, 	Leones rugientes ad praedam, et ad quaerendum a Deo cibum, oritur sol, colliguntur, et in 
habitaculis suis recubant, Ps. civ 21, 22: </p>
<p>in prophetico Bileami, 	Eo tempore dicetur Jacobo et Israeli, Quid fecerit Deus?  en populus sicut vetus leo surget, et sicut leo juvenis efferet se,  non 
requiescet donec comederit rapinam, Num. xxiii 23, 24:   [6]et dein, 	Cum Bileamus vidit Israelem habitantem juxta tribus suas . . . dixit; Incurvat se, cubat sicut leo, et sicut leo vetus, quis suscitabit 
eum? (x)xxiv 2, 9; </p>
<p>est caeleste quod hic describitur, quia est ordo caelestis quem repraesentabant tribus per castrametationes suas, quem in spiritu videbat Bileamus cum `vidit Israelem habitantem 
juxta tribus', n. 6335; ille ordo est ex Divino Bono per Divinum Verum a Domino; in illo ordine est omnis potentia, quae ibi est `leo qui incurvat se, et cubat':  [7]apud Micham, 	Erunt reliquiae 
Jacobi {2}apud gentes, in medio populorum  multorum sicut leo inter bestias silvae, sicut juvenis leo inter greges ovium, qui si transiverit, conculcabit et disperget, et non eripiens;  exaltabitur 
manus tua super hostes tuos, et omnes inimici tui exscindentur, v 7, 8; </p>
<p>hic `leo et juvenis leo' pro caelesti bono et caelesti vero, quae sunt `reliquiae Jacobi'.  Pro simili etiam apud Esaiam xxi 
(x)8, Jer. xxv 38, Ezech. (x)xxxviii 13, Zach. xi 3.  Tale etiam repraesentabant  	Leones ad thronum eboris qui Salomoni, duo juxta manus throni, et duodecim super sex gradibus, 1 Reg. x 18-20; </p>
<p>tum, 	Leones 
super clausuris decem basium ex aere, 1 Reg. vii 29, 36.  [8]Quod `leo' in opposito sensu significet malum amoris sui in sua potentia, patet ab his locis: apud Esaiam, 	Non erit ibi leo, 
et rapax ferarum non ascendet in ea, non invenietur ibi; sed ibunt liberi, sic redempti Jehovae revertentur, et venient Zionem cum cantu, xxxv 9, 10: </p>
<p>apud Jeremiam, 	Israel quare factus in praedam contra 
eum rugiunt leones juvenes, edunt vocem suam, redigunt terram ejus in vastitatem, ii (14,) 15: </p>
<p>apud eundem, 	Ascendit leo ex vepreto suo, et perditor gentium profectus est, exivit e loco suo ad 
redigendum terram in vastitatem, iv 7: </p>
<p>apud eundem, 	Non cognoverunt viam Jehovae, judicium Dei sui, . . . propterea percussit eos leo de silva, et lupus camporum devastabit eos,v 4, 6: </p>
<p>apud Nahum, 	Ubi 
habitaculum leonum, et pascuum leonum juvenum; ubi incessit leo, vetus leo, catulus leonis, nec terrens:  leo rapiens satis pro catulis, et strangulans veteribus leaenis suis, implensque praeda 
cavernas suas, et habitacula sua rapto:  Ecce Ego contra te, dictum Jehovae Zebaoth, et accendam fumo currum (x)ejus, leones autem juvenes tuos comedet gladius; atque exscindam e terra praedam tuam, 
ii 12-14; </p>
<p>ubi de Ninive; in illis locis `leo' pro potentia quae malo amoris sui, cum perdit et vastat: pariter apud Jer. xii 8, xlix 19, l 17, 44, li 38, Ezech. xix 2 - (x)9,  xxxii 2, Joel i 6, Zeph.
