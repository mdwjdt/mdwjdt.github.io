<h3 align="center" class="ired">属天的奥秘 第4122节</h3>
<h4 align="center"></h4><p><strong>4122.</strong>“去追赶雅各”表结合的持续强烈渴望。这从“追赶”的含义清楚可知，“追赶”在此是指结合的持续强烈渴望。就内义而言，此处所论述的主题是中间或居间良善履行完自己的功用后，与纯正良善的分离。就内义而言，分离的过程得到充分描述。然而，这个过程具有这样的性质：人甚至察觉不到它的存在，然而对天使来说，这个过程是显而易见的，包括它的无数变化。他们在正经历重生的人里面，以及作为仆人与之同在的人当中看到他所经历的状态的一切变化。主照着并凭借这些变化使这些天使能在他允许的范围内将他引向良善。正因这一过程在天上具有如此大的功用，所以此处才大篇幅地论述它。由此明显可知内义的性质，内义就是天使的圣言。</p>

And pursued after him. That this signifies a continued ardor of conjunction, is evident from the signification here of "pursuing," as being a continued ardor of conjunction. In the internal sense the 
subject here treated of is the separation of mediate good from genuine good, after the mediate good had served its use. In this sense the process of separation is fully described, but it is of such a 
nature that it cannot even be observed by man to have any existence; and yet to the angels it is very manifest, together with innumerable varieties; for in the man who is being regenerated, and with 
whom they are present as ministers, they see and perceive in this manner all the changes of his state; and according to them and by means of them from the Lord they lead him to good, insofar as the man 
suffers himself to be led; and because the process is of such great use in heaven, it is treated of so much at length here. Hence also it may appear what is the quality of the internal sense, namely, 
that it is the angelic Word. </p>

'And pursued him' means a continuing intense desire to be joined. This is clear from the meaning here of 'pursuing' as a continuing intense desire to be joined. The subject at this point in the internal 
sense is the separation of intermediate good from genuine good after intermediate good had served its use. A full description of the process of separation is what the internal sense contains here. 
Yet the process is such that not even the existence of it is perceptible to man, but to angels it is seen quite clearly, including its countless variations. Thus they see and perceive in one who is being 
regenerated and with whom they are present as servants all the changes of state he undergoes. And in accordance with those changes, and by means of them, the Lord enables those angels to lead him 
towards good, insofar as he allows himself to be led. It is because that process serves so great a use in heaven that it is dealt with so extensively here. It also shows the nature of the internal sense 
- that it is the angelic Word. </p>

</p><b>4122.</b>
`Et persecutus post eum': quod significet ardorem continuatum conjunctionis, constat ex significatione `persequi' hic quod sit ardor continuatus conjunctionis.  Agitur hic in sensu interno de separatione 
boni medii a bono genuino postquam bonum medium inserviverat usui; processus separationis hic plene describitur, sed ille talis est ut ne quidem appercipi possit ab homine quod sit, sed angelis 
apparet manifeste cum innumerabilibus variis, sic enim vident et percipiunt apud hominem qui regeneratur, omnes status illius mutationes, apud quem ut {1} ministri adsunt, et secundum illas et 
per illas a Domino ducunt ad bonum quantum homo se duci patitur; et quia processus ille tanti usus est in caelo, ideo tam multis hic de illo agitur: inde quoque constare potest qualis est sensus 
internus, quod nempe sit Verbum angelicum.      @1 sicut$ </p>
