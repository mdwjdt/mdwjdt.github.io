<h3 align="center" class="ired">属天的奥秘 第5557节</h3>
<h4 align="center"></h4><p><strong>5557.</strong>还有些灵人充当别人的喉舌，但对于自己所说的，却几乎不明白。他们承认这一事实，然而仍继续扮演喉舌的角色。那些活在肉身时只会胡扯瞎吹，根本不思考自己所说的话，并且喜欢无所不谈的人就会变成这个样。我被告知，他们成群结队，其中有的与覆盖身体内脏的膜有关，有的与几乎没有什么感觉的皮肤层有关；因为他们完全是被动力量，不是凭自己行事，而是受其他人驱使。</p>

There are also spirits through whom others speak, and who hardly understand what they say. This they confessed, but still talked much. They become so who in the life of the body only prated, without 
thinking at all about what they said, and loved to talk about everything. I was told that they are in companies, and that some of these relate to the membranes which cover the viscera of the body, and 
some to the cuticles which have but little sensitiveness; for they are only passive powers, and do nothing from themselves, but from others. </p>

There are also spirits who serve as mouthpieces for others, while they themselves understand scarcely anything of what they utter. They have confessed that this is so, yet they go on acting as those 
mouthpieces. This is what those people come to be like who during their lifetime simply babbled on without giving any thought to what they were saying and who loved to speak on every subject. I have been 
told that they exist in groups and that some of them correlate with the membranes that cover the internal organs of the body, others with those layers of skin where little feeling exists. For they 
are wholly passive forces which do not act of themselves but are moved by others. </p>

<p align="center"><b>Latin(1748-1756) 5557</b>
</p><b>5557.</b>
Sunt etiam spiritus per quos alii loquuntur, et ii vix intelligunt quid dicunt; ii fassi sunt, sed usque multum loquuntur. Tales fiunt illi qui in vita corporis modo blaterarunt, et nihil cogitaverunt 
quid dixerant, et amaverunt loqui de omnibus; dictum quod cohortes sint, et quod aliquae eorum referant membranas quae tegunt viscera corporis, aliquae cuticulas quae a sensitivo parum trahunt; sunt 
enim modo vires passivae, et agunt nihil ex se sed ex aliis. </p>
