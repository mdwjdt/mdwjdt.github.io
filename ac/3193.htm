<h3 align="center" class="ired">属天的奥秘 第3193节</h3>
<h4 align="center"></h4><p><strong>3193.</strong>创世记24:62，63.以撒住在南地，刚从庇耳拉海莱回来。傍晚时分，以撒出来在田间默想，举目一看，见有些骆驼正在到来。 <br />“以撒刚从庇耳拉海莱回来”表神圣理性良善从神圣真理本身生出。“住在南地”表随之处于神性之光。“以撒出来在田间默想”表沉浸于良善的理性的状态。“傍晚时分”表相对于在它之下的那些事物。“举目一看”表关注。“见有些骆驼正在到来”表指向属世人中一般的记忆知识。</p>

Verses 62, 63. And Isaac came from coming from Beer-lahai-roi; and he dwelt in the land of the south. And Isaac went out to meditate in the field toward evening; and he lifted up his eyes and saw, and 
behold there were camels coming. "Isaac came from coming from Beer-lahai-roi," signifies Divine good rational born from the Divine truth itself: "and he dwelt in the land of the south," signifies consequently 
in Divine light; "and Isaac went out to meditate in the field," signifies the state of the rational in good; "toward evening," signifies relatively to those things which are beneath; "and he 
lifted up his eyes and saw," signifies attention; "and behold there were camels coming," signifies directed to the general memory-knowledges in the natural man. </p>
