<h3 align="center" class="ired">属天的奥秘 第4681节</h3>
<h4 align="center"></h4><p><strong>4681.</strong>“就恨约瑟，不与他说和睦的话”表蔑视和憎恶，也就是说，对由“约瑟”所代表的神性真理的蔑视和憎恶。这从“恨”和“不与他说和睦的话”的含义清楚可知。“恨”是指蔑视，因为“恨”在内义上并非表示诸如仇恨之人所具有的仇恨；事实上，随着这个词升向天堂，它的含义变得越来越温和，因为在天堂，他们不知道何为仇恨，因此它表示蔑视。“不与他说和睦的话”表示憎恶，因为“说平安的话”表示愿意任何人好。事实上，古人将“平安”的至高意义理解为主自己，将其内在意义理解为祂的国度和其中的生命，或救赎，但将其外在意义理解为世上的安全或健康。“不与他说和睦的话”则表示反面，也就是不愿他好，因而憎恶，在此是指憎恶神性真理。</p>

And they hated him, and could not speak for peace unto him. That this signifies contempt and aversion-contempt for the Divine truth which is represented by Joseph, and aversion for it-is evident from 
the signification of "hating," as being to hold in contempt, for "hatred" in the internal sense does not signify hatred such as men have who hate, for the signification of the word grows milder as it 
rises into heaven, because in heaven they do not know what hatred is, and therefore contempt is what is signified; and from the signification of "not being able to speak for peace unto him," as being 
to be averse to. For to "speak for peace" means to wish anyone well, inasmuch as by "peace" the ancients understood in the supreme sense the Lord Himself, in the internal sense His kingdom and life therein, 
or salvation, but in the external sense safety or health in the world. The contrary of this is not to be able to speak for peace to anyone, that is, not to wish him well, thus to be averse to, 
here to Divine truth. </p>

<p align="center"><b>Elliott(1983-1999) 4681</b></p><p><b>4681.</b>
'And they hated him, and could not speak peaceably to him' means contempt and aversion, that is to say, contempt for Divine Truth represented by 'Joseph', and an aversion to it. This is clear from the 
meaning of 'hating' as holding in contempt, for in the internal sense 'hatred' does not mean hatred as this exists with people given to hatred (for as this word rises up to heaven it takes on a milder 
meaning, because in heaven they do not know what hatred is, and therefore it is contempt that is meant by it); and from the meaning of 'not being able to speak peaceably to him' as being averse, for 
speaking peaceably is wishing another person well. Indeed by peace the ancients understood in the highest sense the Lord Himself, in the internal sense His kingdom and life in that kingdom, which is 
a state of salvation. But in the external sense they understood a comparable state in the world, which is a state of healthiness. The reverse of this is meant by being 'unable to speak peaceably to him', 
that is, not wishing him well, and so being averse, in this case to Divine Truth. </p>

`Et oderunt eum, et non potuerunt loqui ei ad pacem': quod significet contemptum et aversionem, nempe contemptum pro Divino Vero {1} quod per `Josephum' repraesentatur, (o)et aversionem ab illo, 
constat ex significatione `odi' quod {2} sit contemnere; </p>
<p>odium enim in sensu interno non significat odium quale est apud homines qui in odio sunt, mitescit enim significatio illius vocis sicut ascendit 
in caelum, quia in caelo non sciunt quid odium, idcirco est contemptus qui significatur; et ex significatione `non posse loqui ei ad pacem' quod sit avertere se; loqui enim ad pacem est velle 
alicui bene, nam per `pacem' {3} intellexerunt antiqui, in supremo sensu, Ipsum Dominum, in sensu interno {4} regnum Ipsius ac vitam in illo seu salutem, in externo autem salutem in mundo seu valetudinem; 
contrarium ejus est `non posse loqui ei ad pacem,' hoc est, non velle alicui bene, ita avertere se, hic a Divino Vero.      @1 Divini Veri$      @2 i hic$      @3 per pacem enim$      @4
