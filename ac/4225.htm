<h3 align="center" class="ired">属天的奥秘 第4225节</h3>
<h4 align="center"></h4><p><strong>4225.</strong>首先必须说明，谁在这大人里面，谁在这大人外面。凡处于对主之爱和对邻之仁，并发自内心照着邻人里面的良善而向他行善，拥有公义和公平的良知之人皆在这大人里面；因为他们在主里面，因而也在天堂里面。但是，凡陷入自我之爱和尘世之爱，并由此陷入自己的恶欲之人皆在这大人外面。这些人行善只是因为法律要求他们去行善；他们行善是为了自己的荣耀和世俗的财富，以及由此而来的名声。因此，他们内心无情、自私，甚至因自己和世界的缘故而对邻人心怀仇恨和报复，当邻人不支持他们时，便以伤害他为乐。这些人便在这大人的外面；事实上，他们就在地狱。他们不与任何人体器官或部位相对应，而是与被引入人体的各种缺陷和疾病相对应；对此，蒙主的神性怜悯，我将通过后面的经历予以描述。<br />那些在大人外面，也就是在天堂外面的人无法进入大人，即天堂，因为他们的生活与之相反。诚然，他们若以某种方式进去了－有些活在肉身时学会伪装成光明天使的人有时能做到这一点（他们有时被允许进入天堂，是为了叫他们看到自己的本性），只被允许到第一个入口处，也就是到那些心思简单、尚未得到充分教导的人那里。即便在那里，那些伪装成光明天使而进入的人也只能逗留片刻，因为那里的生命是对主之爱和对邻之爱的生命。那里没有任何东西与他们自己的生命相对应，所以他们几乎无法呼吸。灵人和天使也要呼吸（参看<a href="3884.htm">3884</a>-<a href="3893.htm">3893</a>节）。结果，那些伪装成光明天使的人开始感到痛苦，因为呼吸直接关系到一个人生命的自由；说来奇怪，他们最终几乎无法移动，而是变得像那些极其沉重，陷入内在的痛苦和折磨的人，结果他们从那里一头栽下去，直栽入地狱，在那里恢复呼吸和自由运动的能力。这就为何在圣言中，生命以动作（movement）来代表。<br />但那些在大人里面的人能自由呼吸，那时他们处于爱之良善。然而，他们照着那良善的质和量而彼此有别。天堂如此众多即源于此，在圣言中，这些天堂被称作“住处”（约翰福音<a href="http://39-27.cn/约14.2.htm">14:2</a>）。当在自己的天堂里时，人皆过着自己的生活，并从整个天堂接受流注；每个人都是所有流注的焦点，因而处于最完美的平衡；并且是照着天堂所取的奇妙形式如此行的，这种奇妙的形式唯独从主而得，因而具有多样性。</p>

<p align="center"><b>Potts(1905-1910) 4225</b></p><p><b>4225.</b>
At the outset it must be stated who are within the Grand Man, and who are out of it. All those are within the Grand Man who are in love to the Lord and in charity toward the neighbor, and who do good 
to the neighbor from the heart according to the good that is in him, and who have a conscience of what is just and equitable; for these are in the Lord, and consequently in heaven. But all those are 
outside the Grand Man who are in the love of self and the love of the world and the derivative concupiscences, and who do what is good solely on account of the laws, and for the sake of their own honor 
and the world's wealth and the consequent reputation, and who thus are interiorly unmerciful and in hatred and revenge against the neighbor for their own and the world's sake, and are delighted with 
the neighbor's injury when he does not favor them for these are in hell. These do not correspond to any organs and members in the body, but to various corruptions and diseases induced in them; concerning 
which also of the Lord's Divine mercy, I shall speak from experience in the following pages. [2] They who are out of the Grand Man (that is, out of heaven), cannot enter into it, for their lives 
are contrary to it. Nay, if in any way they do enter, which is sometimes done by such as have learned in the life of the body to counterfeit angels of light; nevertheless on arriving there, as is sometimes 
permitted in order that they may learn their own character, they are admitted only to the first entrance, that is, to those who are as yet simple-minded, and who have not as yet been fully instructed. 
And even there those who enter as angels of light are scarcely able to tarry a few moments, because the life there is that of love to the Lord and love toward the neighbor; and as there is nothing 
there which corresponds to their life, they are hardly able to breathe. (That spirits and angels breathe, may be seen above, n. 3884-3893.) Consequently they begin to be distressed, for respiration 
takes place in accordance with freedom of life; and wonderful to say they are finally scarcely able to move, but become like those who are in, anguish and torment taking possession of their interiors, 
and they therefore cast themselves down headlong, even into hell, where they recover their respiration and power of motion. Hence it is that in the Word life is represented by mobility. [3] But they 
who are in the Grand Man breathe freely when they are in the good of love; but nevertheless they are distinguished according to the quality and the amount of the good. Hence there are so many heavens, 
which in the Word are called "mansions" (John 14:2). And everyone when in his own heaven is in his life, and receives influx from the universal heaven, each person there being a center of all the 
influxes, and therefore in the most perfect equilibrium; and this according to the amazing form of heaven, which is from the Lord alone; thus with all variety. </p>

<p align="center"><b>Elliott(1983-1999) 4225</b></p><p><b>4225.</b>
In the first place it must be stated who are within the Grand Man and who are outside it. All who are governed by love to the Lord and charity towards the neighbour, and who from their hearts do good 
to him in the measure that good is present in him, and who have a conscience of what is just and fair, are within the Grand Man, for they abide in the Lord and are consequently in heaven. Not so all 
who are governed by self-love and love of the world and therefore by their own very evil desires. These do good solely because laws require them to do it; they do it for the sake of personal position, 
worldly wealth, and reputation resulting from these. Thus they are ruthless interiorly, and being selfish and worldly-minded they are steeped in hatred of and revenge against their neighbour, and take 
delight in his injury when he does not favour them. These are outside the Grand Man; indeed they are in hell. They do not correspond to any organs or members within the body but to various defects and 
diseases induced into them, which too will in the Lord's Divine mercy be described from experience later on. </p>
<p></p>
<p><b>[2]</b>
 Those outside the Grand Man, that is, outside heaven, cannot enter it since their 
lives are contrary to it. Indeed if they do gain any kind of entrance, as some on occasions do who during their lifetime have learned to impersonate angels of light (their entry into heaven being sometimes 
permitted to let them see what they themselves are really like), they are admitted no further than the first part of the way in, that is, no further than the part where those people are gathered 
who are still simple and have not yet been fully taught. Such people who come in impersonating angels of light are able to remain there for barely a few moments because the life there is that of love 
to the Lord and of love towards the neighbour. And because nothing there corresponds to their own life they are scarcely able to breathe; for spirits and angels too are beings who breathe, see <a href="3884.htm">3884</a>-<a href="3893.htm">3893</a>. 
As a consequence those impersonating angels start to experience pain, because the act of breathing is directly related to one's freedom to live in one's own way; and what is remarkable, they are 
at length scarcely able to move but become such as are weighed down, inwardly seized with anguish and torment, as a result of which they cast themselves away from there headlong, even into hell where 
breathing and freedom of movement return to them. And this is why in the Word life is represented by movement. </p>
<p></p>
<p><b>[3]</b>
 The breathing of those who are within the Grand Man however is free when the good 
of love is alive in them. Yet they are distinguishable any one from another according to the nature and the amount of that good; and this is the origin of so many heavens, which in the Word are called 
'rooms', <a href="http://bible.gospelcom.net/cgi-bin/bible?passage=John%2014:2&amp;version=ESV&amp;interface=print&amp;showfn=yes&amp;showxref">John 14:2</a>. And anyone present in his own heaven leads the life that is his own and has the whole of heaven flowing into him. Everyone there is a focal point of all influxes, and because of 
that he experiences most perfect equilibrium, doing so in accordance with the amazing form heaven takes, which is received from the Lord alone, with much variety from person to person. </p>

In antecessum dicendum quinam sunt intra Maximum Hominem, et quinam sunt extra illum: omnes qui in amore in Dominum et in charitate erga proximum sunt {1}, {2} et ei bonum faciunt ex corde secundum 
bonum apud illum, et qui conscientiam justi et aequi habent, illi sunt intra Maximum Hominem, sunt enim in Domino, proinde in caelo; at omnes qui in amore sui et in amore mundi (o)sunt, et inde 
in concupiscentiis, ac {3} solummodo propter leges, sui honorem, et opes mundi, (c)et propter famam inde, bonum faciunt, ita qui interius immisericordes sunt, in odio et vindicta contra proximum sui 
et mundi causa, et delectantur ejus damnis quando sibi non favet, illi sunt extra Maximum Hominem, sunt enim in inferno; hi non correspondent aliquibus organis et {4} membris in corpore, sed vitiis 
et morbis eis inductis variis, de quibus etiam, ex Divina Domini Misericordia, ab experientia in sequentibus.  [2] Qui extra Maximum Hominem sunt, hoc est, extra caelum, illi non possunt intrare 
in illum, vitae enim sunt contrariae; immo si aliquo modo intrant, quod fit quandoque a talibus qui lucis angelos in vita corporis mentiri edocti sunt, sed cum illuc veniunt, quod quandoque permittitur 
ex causa ut sciant quales sunt, sed admittuntur modo ad primum introitum, hoc est, ad illos qui simplices adhuc sunt et nondum ad plenum instructi, tunc illi qui sicut lucis angeli intrant, vix 
aliquibus momentis ibi morari possunt, quia ibi est vita amoris in Dominum et amoris erga proximum; et quia ibi nihil correspondet vitae illorum, vix possunt respirare; quod spiritus et angeli quoque 
{5} respirent, videatur n. 3884-3893; inde incipiunt angi, nam respiratio se habet secundum liberum vitae, et quod mirum, vix tandem possunt se movere, sed fiunt sicut qui in gravedine sunt, 
angore et cruciatu occupante interiora, quapropter se inde ejiciunt praecipites, et hoc usque ad infernum, ubi respiratio illis et mobilitas; inde est quod vita in Verbo per mobilitatem repraesentetur. 
 Qui autem in Maximo Homine sunt, illi in respirationis libero sunt cum in bono amoris; sed usque distincti (o)sunt secundum boni quale et quantum, inde tot caeli {6} sunt, qui in Verbo vocantur 
mansiones, Joh. xiv 2; estque unusquisque in suo caelo in sua vita, et habet influxum ab universo caelo; quisque ibi est centrum influxuum omnium, inde in perfectissimo aequilibrio, et hoc secundum 
formam stupendam caeli, quae a solo Domino, ita cum omni varietate.      @1 after Dominum$      @2 i ex interiore homine$      @3 after favet, two lines below.$      @4 aut$      @5 etiam$
