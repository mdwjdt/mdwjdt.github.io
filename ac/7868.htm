<h4 align="center"></h4><p><strong>7868.</strong>出埃及记12:12-16.那夜我要巡行埃及地，把埃及地一切头生的，从人到牲畜，都击杀了；又要审判埃及一切的神明：我是耶和华。这血要在你们所住的房屋上作记号，我一见这血，就越过你们去，我击打埃及地的时候，灾殃必不临到你们身上作灭命的。这一日要给你们做记念；你们要守这日为耶和华的节，要世世代代守为一个节日，作为永远的定例。你们要吃无酵饼七日。头一日要把酵从你们各家中除去，因为从头一日起，到第七日为止，凡吃有酵之物的，灵魂必从以色列中剪除。头一日你们当有圣会，第七日也当有圣会，这两日之内，无论何工都不可作，除了每个灵魂所必须吃的以外，这是你们惟一要做的。<br />“我要巡行埃及地”表在那些进行侵扰的人当中的出现。“那夜”表他们邪恶的状态。“把埃及地一切头生的，都击杀了”表对那些陷入与仁分离之信之人的诅咒。“从人到牲畜”表他们的恶欲，无论内层还是外层。“又要审判埃及一切的神明”表他们那即将受到诅咒的虚假。“我是耶和华”表主，祂是独一神。“这血”表属于纯真之良善的真理。“要在你们所住的房屋上作记号”表这是对良善意愿的一个见证。“我一见这血”表那些施加诅咒的人对这真理的发现。“就越过你们去”表它会远离那里。“灾殃必不临到你们身上作灭命的”表来自地狱的诅咒不会进入。“我击打埃及地的时候”表当那些陷入与仁分离之信的人受到诅咒时。“这一日要给你们做记念”表这种状态在敬拜中的性质。“你们要守这日为耶和华的节”表由于摆脱诅咒而对主的敬拜。“世世代代”表在那些属于信与仁的事物上。“要守为一个节日，作为永远的定例”表就那些属于属灵教会的人而言，照着天堂的秩序而对主的敬拜。“七日”表神圣之物。“你们要吃无酵饼”表从虚假中洁净。“头一日要把酵从你们各家中除去”表良善里面必没有任何虚假。“因为凡吃有酵之物的”表凡将虚假归与自己的。“灵魂必从以色列中剪除”表他将与那些属于属灵教会的人分离，并受到诅咒。“从头一日起，到第七日为止”表一个神圣而完整的状态。“头一日你们当有圣会”表一开始，所有人都必须在一起。“第七日也当有圣会”表因此，他们必须在状态结束时在一起。“这两日之内，无论何工都不可作”表在此期间放弃地上和世界的事物。“除了每个灵魂所必须吃的以外”表当属灵和属天的良善变成他们自己的时。“这是你们惟一要做的”表这时他们必须只专注于这些事物。</p>

Verses 12-16. And I will pass through the land of Egypt in that night, and I will smite all the firstborn in the land of Egypt, from man and even unto beast; and on all the gods of Egypt I will do judgments; 
I am Jehovah. And the blood shall be to you for a sign upon the houses where ye are; and I shall see the blood, and I will pass over you, and there shall not be in you a plague for a destroyer, 
when I smite the land of Egypt. And this day shall be unto you for a memorial, and ye shall keep it a feast to Jehovah in your generations, ye shall keep it by an eternal statute. Seven days shall 
ye eat unleavened things; even on the first day ye shall cause leaven to cease from your houses; for everyone that eateth what is leavened, from the first day until the seventh day, even that soul shall 
be cut off from Israel. And there shall be for you in the first day a holy convocation, and in the seventh day a holy convocation; no work shall be done in them, save that which every soul must eat, 
this only shall be done by you. "And I will pass through the land of Egypt," signifies presence with those who had infested; "in that night," signifies the state of their evil; "and I will smite all 
the firstborn in the land of Egypt," signifies the damnation of those who are in faith separate from charity; "from man and even unto beast," signifies their evil cupidities interior and exterior; "and 
on all the gods of Egypt I will do judgments," signifies their falsities which are to be damned; "I am Jehovah," signifies the Lord, that He is the only God; "and the blood," signifies the truth of 
the good of innocence; "shall be to you for a sign upon the houses where ye are," signifies that it is a testifying of the will of good; "and I shall see the blood," signifies the noticing of this truth 
by those who inflict the damnation; "I will pass over you," signifies that it will flee from thence; "and there shall not be in you a plague for a destroyer," signifies that damnation from the hells 
shall not flow in; "when I smite the land of Egypt," signifies when they are damned who are in faith separate from charity; "and this day shall be unto you for a memorial," signifies the quality of 
this state in worship; "and ye shall keep it a feast to Jehovah," signifies the worship of the Lord on account of liberation from damnation; "in your generations," signifies in those things which are 
of faith and charity; "ye shall keep it by an eternal statute," signifies the worship of the Lord according to the order of heaven on the part of those who are of the spiritual church; "seven days," 
signifies what is holy; "shall ye eat things unleavened," signifies purification from falsities; "even on the first day ye shall cause leaven to cease from your houses," signifies that no falsity whatever 
must be in the good; "for everyone that eateth what is leavened," signifies who appropriates to himself falsity; "even that soul shall be cut off from Israel," signifies that he shall be separated 
from those who are of the spiritual church, and that he shall be damned; "from the first day until the seventh day," signifies a full holy state; "and there shall be for you in the first day a holy 
convocation," signifies that in the beginning all shall be together; "and in the seventh day a holy convocation," signifies so at the end of the state; "no work shall be done in them," signifies a keeping 
back then from earthly and worldly things; "save that which every soul must eat," signifies when spiritual and celestial good is appropriated; "this only shall be done by you," signifies that to 
these only they shall then pay attention. </p>

Verses 12-16 And I will go through the land of Egypt on that night, and will strike all the firstborn in the land of Egypt, from man (homo) even to beast; and on all the gods of Egypt I will make judgements. 
I am Jehovah. And the blood will be a sign for you on the houses where you are; and I will see the blood and pass you by, and the plague will not be on you for the destroyer, when I strike the 
land of Egypt. And that day shall be to you for a memorial, and you shall keep it as a feast to Jehovah, throughout your generations; you shall keep it as a feast by an eternal statute. Seven days you 
shall eat unleavened bread; even on the first day you shall remove<A name="fntext1"></a><A href="#fn1"><sup>a</sup></a> yeast from your houses, for anyone eating anything made with yeast, that soul shall be cut off from Israel, from the first day until 
the seventh day. And on the first day there shalt be a holy convocation, and on the seventh day there shall be a holy convocation for you. No work shall be done on them; only what must be eaten by 
every soul, this alone shall be done by you. </p>

keep it as a feast by an eternal statute' means worship of the Lord in keeping with the order of heaven for those belonging to the spiritual Church. 'Seven days' means what is holy. 'You shall eat 
unleavened bread' means purification from falsities. 'Even on the first day you shall remove yeast from your houses' means that there must be no falsity whatever in good. 'For anyone eating anything made 
with yeast' means whoever makes falsity his own. 'That soul shall be cut off from Israel' means that he will be separated from those belonging to the spiritual Church, and that he will be damned. 
'From the first day until the seventh day' means a holy and complete state. 'And on the first day there shall be a holy convocation' means that at the beginning all must be together. 'On the seventh day

Vers. 12-16.  Et transibo per terram Aegypti in nocte illa, et percutiam omne primogenitum in terra Aegypti ab homine et usque ad bestiam; et in omnes deos Aegypti faciam judicia, Ego Jehovah.  Et erit 
sanguis vobis ad signum super domibus ubi vos, et videro sanguinem, et praeteribo praeter vos, et non erit in vobis plaga perditori, in percutere Me terram Aegypti.  Et erit dies ille vobis ad memoriale, 
et feriabimini illum festum Jehovae, generationibus vestris, statuto aeterno feriabimini illum.  Septem diebus azyma comedetis, etiam in die primo cessare facietis fermentum e domibus vestris, 
quia omnis comedens (x)fermentatum, et exscindetur anima illa ex Israele, a die primo usque ad diem septimum.  Et in die primo convocatio sancta, et in die septimo convocatio sancta erit vobis; nullum 
opus fiet in illis, tantum quod (x)comedatur omni animae, hoc solum fiet vobis.  `Et transibo per terram Aegypti' significat praesentiam apud illos qui infestarunt: `in nocte illa' significat statum

`et praeteribo praeter vos' significat quod fugiet inde: `et non erit in vobis plaga perditori' significat quod damnatio ab infernis non influet: `in percutere Me terram Aegypti' significat cum damnantur 
illi qui in fide separata a charitate: `et erit dies ille vobis ad memoriale' significat status illius quale in cultu: `feriabimini illum festum Jehovae' significat cultum Domini propter liberationem
