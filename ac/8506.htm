<h3 align="center" class="ired">属天的奥秘 第8506节</h3>
<h4 align="center"></h4><p><strong>8506.</strong>“六天可以收集它”表在真理与良善结合之前，对真理的领受。这从“六天”的含义清楚可知，“六天”是指争战和劳碌的状态（参看<a href="8494.htm">8494</a>节），在此是指领受真理的状态，或通过真理获得良善时的状态（<a href="8505.htm">8505</a>节），因为这个状态里有劳碌和争战。人在该状态下被抛入试探，也就是与他里面的邪恶并虚假的争战之中；这时，主为此人而争战，也与他同在。但在这个状态之后有一个良善和真理结合的状态，因而那时有一个主也安歇的状态。第七天的安歇或安息日所代表的，就是这种状态。那时主之所以休息，是因为当良善与真理结合时，此人就在主里面，被主引导，没有劳碌和争战。这种状态就是前面所论述的第二种状态（<a href="8505.htm">8505</a>节）所表示的。</p>

Six days ye shall gather it. That this signifies the reception of truth before it is being conjoined with good, is evident from the signification of "six days," as being states of combat and of labor 
(see above, n. 8494), here a state of the reception of truth, or a state when good is acquired through truth (n. 8505), for in this state there are labor and combat. In this state man is let into temptations, 
which are combats with the evils and falsities in him; and then the Lord fights for the man and also with him. But after this state there is a state of the conjunction of good and truth, thus 
at that time a state of rest for the Lord also. This state is what was represented by the rest on the seventh day, or day of the Sabbath. That the Lord then has rest, is because when good has been conjoined 
with truth, the man is in the Lord, and is led by the Lord without labor and combat. This state is what is meant by the second state, treated of above, n. 8505. </p>

<p align="center"><b>Elliott(1983-1999) 8506</b></p><p><b>8506.</b>
'Six days you shall gather it' means the acceptance of truth before it is joined to good. This is clear from the meaning of 'six days' as states of conflict and labour, dealt with above in <a href="8494.htm">8494</a>, at this 
point states when truth is gaining acceptance, or states when good is being acquired through truth, dealt with immediately above in <a href="8505.htm">8505</a>; for during this state there is labour and conflict. During 
it a person is pitched into temptations, which are conflicts with the evils and falsities residing with him; at this time the Lord fights for him and also alongside him. But this state is followed by 
a state in which good and truth are joined together, a state that is accordingly one of rest also for the Lord. This state is what rest on the seventh or sabbath day represented. The reason why it is 
rest for the Lord is that when good has been joined to truth, a person abides in the Lord and is led by the Lord without labour or conflict. This state is what is meant by the second state spoken of 
immediately above in <a href="8505.htm">8505</a>. </p>

<p align="center"><b>Latin(1748-1756) 8506</b>
</p><b>8506.</b>
`Sex diebus colligetis illud': quod significet receptionem veri antequam conjungitur bono, constat ex significatione `sex dierum' quod sint status pugnae et laboris, de qua supra n. 8494, hic status 
receptionis veri, seu status cum acquiritur bonum per verum, de quo mox supra n. 8505, in hoc enim statu est labor et pugna; in eo statu homo in tentationes mittitur, quae sunt pugnae cum malis et falsis 
apud illum; et tunc Dominus pro homine pugnat, et quoque cum illo; at post hunc statum est status conjunctionis boni et veri, ita tunc status requiei etiam {1}Domino; hic status est qui repraesentabatur 
per requiem in die septimo seu die sabbati; quod tunc requies Domino, est quia cum bonum conjunctum est vero, homo in Domino est, et ducitur a Domino absque labore et pugna; hic status est qui 
intelligitur per alterum statum, de quo mox supra n. (x)8505. 	@1 Domini$ </p>
