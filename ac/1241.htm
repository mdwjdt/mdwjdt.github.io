<h4 align="center"></h4><p><strong>1241.</strong>至于“希伯”是第二代古教会的第一个创始人，他就表该教会，情况是这样：如前所述，第一代古教会传播甚广，尤其盛行于亚洲；但随着时间推移，和每个地方的所有教会一样，它逐渐堕落，被既关注外在敬拜，也关注内在敬拜的改革者们掺入杂质，这种情形在各处都有发生；特别是，古教会从上古教会经口头相传得来的所有具有象征性和代表性的事物（它们都指向主和主的国），都被转变成了偶像崇拜，在有些民族中甚至沦为巫术；为避免整个教会灭亡，主定意在某个地方重新设立象征性和代表性的敬拜，此事由希伯完成。这种敬拜主要由外在事物构成。除了祭司的职责及其与之相关的事物外，敬拜的外在还包括高地、小树林、柱像、油膏，以及很多被称为典章的其它事物。敬拜的内在则包括从洪水前的那个时代，尤其从那些叫“以诺”的人那里传下来的教义；被称作“以诺”的人将上古教会所直觉到的事物搜集起来，制成教义，这些教义就是他们的圣言；该教会的敬拜就出自这些内在事物和上述外在事物。这种敬拜形式由希伯设立，不过有所添加和更改，特别是，他们开始把献祭置于其它仪式之上。献祭在正宗的古教会是前所未闻的，唯独存在于含和迦南后代中的一些人中，这些人是偶像崇拜者，他们是可以的，以免他们将自己的儿女献为祭物。由此清楚可知这第二代古教会的性质，它由希伯创立，并在他的后代，即所谓的希伯来民族中延续。</p>

<p><strong>[NCE]1241.</strong> Concerning Eber as the founder of the second ancient church, and his symbolism as that church, this is the situation: The first ancient church, as noted [<a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_1241/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_1238#subsection-2-2" target=_top>1238:2</a>], spread far and wide throughout the world, especially in the Near East. Over time it deteriorated, as all religions everywhere do, and subverters in various places adulterated both its outward and its inward worship. Their main offense was to take all the symbolic and representative lore that the ancient church had received from the mouth of the earliest church — every bit of which focused on the Lord and his kingdom — and make it idolatrous. Some nations even turned it into magic. To prevent the entire church from perishing, the Lord allowed symbolic and representative worship to be restored in some places, and this was done by Eber, whose worship consisted chiefly in external things. The externals of the religion were high places, groves, pillars, and anointings, not to mention priesthoods and the traditions governing them, along with many other rules, which were called statutes.<br />The deeper aspects of the religion were doctrinal precepts dating back to the time before the Flood, received principally from the people referred to as Enoch. These people gathered together the perceptive knowledge of the earliest church and out of it constructed doctrinal precepts that formed their Word.{*1} The internals and the externals just described formed the worship of this religion. The style of worship was founded by Eber but later enlarged and also changed. In particular, its worshipers started to consider sacrifices more important than other types of ritual. Sacrifice was unknown in the true ancient church. It existed exclusively with certain idolatrous descendants of Ham and Canaan and was tolerated among them to prevent them from sacrificing their own sons and daughters.<br />These descriptions illustrate the nature of this second ancient church, founded by Eber and maintained among his descendants, who were called the Hebrew nation.<br /><br /><strong>Footnotes:</strong><br />{*1} For the process of gathering insights and constructing doctrine, see <a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_1241/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_518" target=_top>518-522</a>, which discuss Enoch's genealogy in <a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_1241/bible_king-james-version_genesis_5_22-24" target=_top>Genesis 5:22-24</a>.

As to Eber being the first institutor of the second Ancient Church, by whom this church is signified, the case is this. The first Ancient Church, so widely spread as has been stated, especially through 
the Asiatic world, in process of time degenerated-as is usual with all churches everywhere-and was adulterated by innovators, as to both its external and its internal worship, and this in various places; 
and especially by the fact that all things significative and representative which the Ancient Church had from the mouth of the Most Ancient Church-which all bore reference to the Lord and His Kingdom-were 
turned into things idolatrous, and by some of the nations into things magical. That the whole church might not go to ruin, it was permitted by the Lord that significative and representative 
worship should be somewhere reestablished, which was done by Eber. This worship consisted chiefly in externals. The externals of worship, in addition to the priestly offices and what pertained to them, 
were high places, groves, statues, anointings, and many other things called statutes. The internals of worship were doctrinal things handed down from the time before the flood, especially from those 
who were called "Enoch," who collected the perceptive findings of the Most Ancient Church, and made doctrinal things therefrom. These were their Word; and from these internals and those externals came 
the worship of this church, a worship set up anew by Eber, but added to, and also changed. Especially did they begin to exalt sacrifices above other rites. In the true Ancient Church sacrifices had 
been unknown, except among some of the descendants of Ham and Canaan, who were idolaters, and with whom they were permitted to prevent them from sacrificing their sons and daughters. From all this the 
quality of this second Ancient Church, instituted by Eber and continued among his posterity who were called the Hebrew nation, is manifest. </p>

As regards Eber's being the first founder of the second Ancient Church and meaning that Church, the situation is this: Spread far and wide, as has been stated, especially throughout the Asiatic world, 
the first Ancient Church degenerated in course of time - as all Churches do everywhere- and was adulterated by innovators as regards external worship as well as internal. And this happened in various 
places. It degenerated primarily through the conversion into idolatry, and among some nations into magic, of all the meaningful signs and the representatives which the Ancient Church received orally 
from the Most Ancient Church, all of which signs and representatives had reference to the Lord and His kingdom. To prevent the whole Church from going to ruin the Lord permitted worship made up of meaningful 
signs and of representatives to be re-introduced in some place, which was done by Eber. It was a worship that consisted chiefly in things that are external. The external features of worship, 
in addition to priests and the things requiring priests, were high places, groves, pillars, anointings, and many other things that were called statutes. The internal features of worship were matters of 
doctrine that had come down from the time before the Flood, chiefly from those people called 'Enoch' who gathered together perceptions the Most Ancient Church had possessed and made these into matters 
of doctrine. These matters of doctrine constituted their Word; and from these internal things and the previously mentioned external things came the worship of this Church, a form of worship established 
by Eber, but added to and also altered. Above all they began to make sacrifices more important than any other ritual forms. Sacrifices had been unknown in the true Ancient Church, and had existed 
solely among some of Ham's and Canaan's descendants who were idolaters, where those sacrifices had been permitted to prevent them from sacrificing their own sons and daughters. From these considerations 
it is clear what this second Ancient Church was like which was established by Eber and perpetuated among his descendants called the Hebrew nation. </p>

Quod 'Eberus' fuit primus institutor Ecclesiae Antiquae alterius per quem significatur haec Ecclesia, ita se res habet:  prima Antiqua Ecclesia tam late, ut dictum, per orbem cumprimis Asiaticum diffusa, 
sicut solent omnes Ecclesiae ubivis, temporis successu degenerata et ab innovatoribus adulterata fuit, tam quoad cultum externum quam quoad internum, et hoc variis in locis; cumprimis ex eo quod 
omnia significativa et repraesentativa quae Ecclesia Antiqua habuit ex ore Antiquissimae Ecclesiae, quae omnia spectabant Dominum et Ipsius regnum, verterentur in idololatrica, et apud aliquas gentes 
in magica; ne universa Ecclesia rueret, permissum fuit a Domino ut significativus et repraesentativus cultus alicubi restauraretur, quod factum ab 'Ebero,' qui cultus principaliter in externis constabat; 
externa cultus fuerunt excelsa, luci, statuae, unctiones, praeter sacerdotia et quae sacerdotiorum fuerunt, et plura alia quae vocata sunt statuta; interna cultus fuerunt doctrinalia ab antediluviano 
tempore, cumprimis ab illis qui 'Hanochus' appellati, qui perceptiva Antiquissimae Ecclesiae collegerunt, et inde doctrinalia fecerant; haec fuerunt illorum Verbum; ex his et illis Ecclesiae hujus 
cultus fuit qui instauratus ab Ebero, sed auctus, et quoque mutatus; cumprimis prae aliis ritualibus praeferre inceperunt sacrificia, quae in vera Antiqua Ecclesia ignota fuerunt, solum apud quosdam 
Hami et Canaanis posteros, qui idololatrae, ibi permissa ob causam ne filios et filias suas sacrificarent.  Ex his constat qualis haec Ecclesia altera Antiqua fuit quae ab Ebero instituta, et in posteritate 
ejus quae dicta gens Hebraea, continuata. </p>
