<h3 align="center" class="ired">属天的奥秘 第9222节</h3>
<h4 align="center"></h4><p><strong>9222.</strong>“不可咒诅你百姓的首领”表也不可亵渎真理的教义。这从“首领”、“百姓”和“咒诅”的含义清楚可知：“首领”是指教会的首要真理（参看<a href="5044.htm">5044</a>节）；“百姓”是指那些处于教义真理的人（<a href="1259.htm">1259</a>，<a href="1260.htm">1260</a>，<a href="2928.htm">2928</a>，<a href="3295.htm">3295</a>，<a href="3581.htm">3581</a>，<a href="7207.htm">7207</a>节）；“咒诅”是指亵渎。从内义明显看出这些禁令彼此之间的联系何等紧密；因为“不可咒骂神”表示不可亵渎神之真理，“不可咒诅首领”表示不可亵渎真理的教义。神之真理就是圣言，教会的教义是取自圣言的真理。在此可以用几句话来说明对神之真理的亵渎是何性质。神之真理就是圣言和取自圣言的教义。那些从心里否认它的人就亵渎了它，即便他们嘴上赞美并传讲圣言。亵渎就隐藏在这否认里面，当他们独自思考时，尤其在来世，亵渎就会爆发出来。因为在来世，外在的约束被除去后，说话的是人的心。<br />那些亵渎，也就是否认圣言的人根本不能接受任何信之真理或良善。因为圣言教导主、天堂和地狱、死后生命、信和仁，以及许多其它事物的存在；对此，没有圣言，也就是启示，没有人会知道（<a href="8944.htm">8944</a>节）。因此，那些否认圣言的人不可能接受圣言的任何教导；因为当他们读到或听到圣言时，一种消极心态就会出现，要么消灭真理，要么把它变成虚假。<br />因此，教会之人首先要做的事就是信圣言；这是处于信之真理和仁之良善之人的主要特征。但对那些沉浸于爱自己爱世界的邪恶之人来说，不信圣言是主要特征；因为他们一思想圣言，就立刻弃绝，还亵渎它。有人若真的看见在那些沉浸于这些爱的邪恶之人中间，反对圣言的亵渎何等之大，是何性质，必感到惊恐万分。此人在世上时，并未意识到这些亵渎的存在，因为它们隐藏在那有意识的活跃思维的观念后面，而与其他人交谈，进入话语的，正是这活跃的思维。然而在来世，他们被揭露，并且看上去很可怕。<br />亵渎有两种；有些亵渎出自理解力，同时未出自意愿；有些亵渎则通过理解力出自意愿。看上去十分可怕的，是这后一种亵渎，而不是前一种。通过理解力出自意愿的亵渎源于生活的邪恶，而只出自理解力，未同时出自意愿的亵渎则源于教义的虚假，或外在感官的幻觉，它们欺骗了一个扎根于无知状态的人。说这些事是为了叫人们知道对神之真理，也就是圣言，以及取自它的教义的亵渎是何性质，这种亵渎由“咒骂神，咒诅百姓的首领”来表示。</p>

And a prince in thy people thou shall not execrate. That this signifies that neither are the doctrines of truth to be blasphemed, is evident from the signification of "a prince," as being the primary 
truths of the church (see n. 5044); from the signification of "a people," as being those who are in truths of doctrine (n. 1259, 1260, 2928, 3295, 3581, 7207); and from the signification of "execrating," 
as being to blaspheme. How closely these things are connected, is evident from the internal sense; for by "not to curse God" is signified not to blaspheme truth Divine, and by "not to execrate a 
prince" is signified not to blaspheme the doctrine of truth. Truth Divine is the Word, and the doctrine of the church is the truth thence derived. A few words may be said about the blaspheming of truth 
Divine. Truth Divine is the Word, and is doctrine from the Word. Those blaspheme who at heart deny these, even though with the mouth they may praise the Word, and preach it. The blasphemy is hidden 
in the denial, and it emerges when they are left by themselves, especially in the other life; for there hearts speak, after outward things have been removed. [2] Those who blaspheme, that is, deny the 
Word, are unable to receive anything of the truth and good of faith; for the Word teaches the existence of the Lord, of heaven and hell, of the life after death, of faith and charity, and of many other 
things, which without the Word, that is, without revelation, would be quite unknown (n. 8944); and therefore those who deny the Word cannot receive anything of what the Word teaches; for when they 
either read or hear it, a negative attitude presents itself, which either extinguishes the truth, or turns it into falsity. [3] Wherefore the very first thing with the man of the church is to believe 
the Word; and this is the chief thing with him who is in the truth of faith and the good of charity. But with those who are in the evils of the love of self and of the world, the chief thing is not 
to believe the Word, for they reject it the moment they think about it, and likewise blaspheme it. If a man were to see the magnitude and the nature of the blasphemies against the Word that exist with 
those who are in the evils of these loves, he would be horrified. While the man himself is in the world he is not aware of this, because these blasphemies are hidden behind the ideas of that active thought 
which with men passes into speech. Nevertheless they are revealed in the other life, and appear horrible.  [4] Blasphemies are of two kinds; there are those which come forth from the understanding 
and not at the same time from the will; and those which come forth from the will through the understanding. It is these latter blasphemies which are so horrible; but not the former. Those which come 
forth from the will through the understanding are from evil of life; but those which come forth from the understanding only, and not at the same time from the will, are from falsity of doctrine, or 
from the fallacies of the external senses, which deceive a man who is held fast in ignorance. These things have been said in order that it may be known how the case is with the blaspheming of truth 
Divine, that is, of the Word and its derivative doctrine, which is signified by "cursing God and execrating a prince of the people." </p>

'And you shall not curse a governor of your people' means that teachings presenting the truth are not to be, either - not to be blasphemed. This is clear from the meaning of 'a governor (or prince)' 
as the Church's primary truths, dealt with in <a href="5044.htm">5044</a>; from the meaning of 'people' as those governed by truths taught by doctrine, dealt with in <a href="1259.htm">1259</a>, <a href="1260.htm">1260</a>, <a href="2928.htm">2928</a>, <a href="3295.htm">3295</a>, <a href="3581.htm">3581</a>, <a href="7207.htm">7207</a>; and from the meaning 
of 'cursing' as blaspheming. What connection these prohibitions have with each other is evident from the internal sense; for 'not reviling God' means not blaspheming God's truth, and 'not cursing a governor' 
means not blaspheming teachings that present the truth, God's truth being the Word, and the Church's teachings being truth drawn from the Word.  </p>
<p>Let the nature of blasphemy against God's truth 
be stated briefly here. God's truth is the Word and teachings drawn from the Word. Those who repudiate it in their heart blaspheme it even though they praise and declare it with their lips. Hidden 
within repudiation lies blasphemy, which also bursts out into the open when they are left to think by themselves, especially in the next life. For there when external [restraints] have been removed people's 
hearts speak.  </p>
<p></p>
<p><b>[2]</b>
 Those who blaspheme or repudiate the Word cannot receive anything at all of the truth or good of faith. For the Word teaches the existence of the Lord, of heaven and hell, 
of life after death, of faith and charity, and of many other things, about which no one would have any knowledge whatever without the Word or revelation, <a href="8944.htm">8944</a>. Therefore those who repudiate the Word 
cannot receive anything taught by the Word; for when it is read or heard by them it is met with a negative attitude of mind that either annihilates truth or turns it into falsity.  </p>
<p></p>
<p><b>[3]</b>
 First of all 
therefore with a member of the Church comes belief in the Word; and this is the chief characteristic of one who is guided by the truth of faith and governed by the good of love. But with those who are 
steeped in the evils of self-love and love of the world non-belief in the Word is the chief characteristic; for when they think about it they instantly reject it and also blaspheme it. If anyone were 
to see how great the blasphemies are against the Word, and what they are like, with those who are steeped in the evils of those kinds of love he would be horrified. While in the world the person is 
unaware of their existence, since they lie concealed behind the ideas of his conscious thought, and it is this that comes out into speech with other people. Even so they are revealed in the next life, 
where they appear horrible.  </p>
<p></p>
<p><b>[4]</b>
 There are two kinds of blasphemies - those that come out of the understanding but not at the same time out of the will, and those that come out of the will by way 
of the understanding. The second kind are the ones which are so horrible, not the first. Those that come out of the will by way of the understanding spring from evil of life, whereas those that come 
solely out of the understanding and not at the same time out of the will spring from falsity of doctrine or from the illusions of the outward senses that deceive a person set fast in a state of ignorance. 
These things have been stated in order that people may know the nature of blasphemy against God's truth, that is, the Word, and against teachings drawn from it, meant by 'reviling God and cursing 
a governor of the people'.  </p>

`Et principem in populo tuo non execraberis':  quod significet quod nec doctrinae veri, nempe blasphemandum, constat ex significatione `principis' quod sint primaria vera Ecclesiae, de qua n. 5044, 
ex significatione `populi' quod sint qui in veris doctrinae, de qua n. 1259, 1260, 2928, 3295, 3581, 7207, et ex significatione `execrari' quod sit (x)blasphemare. Quomodo haec cohaerent, patet a sensu 
interno, nam per `non maledicere Deo' significatur non (x)blasphemare verum Divinum, et per 'non execrari principem' significatur non (x)blasphemare doctrinam veri; verum Divinum est Verbum, et doctrina 
Ecclesiae est verum inde. Paucis licet dicere quomodo se habet cum blasphematione veri Divini: verum Divinum est Verbum et est doctrina e Verbo; qui {1}hoc negant corde, illi blasphemant etiamsi 
ore id laudant et praedicant; latet in negatione blasphemia, quae etiam erumpit cum sibi relicti cogitant, imprimis in altera vita, nam ibi remotis externis corda loquuntur. Qui blasphemant seu negant 
Verbum, illi nihil veri ac boni fidei 2 possunt recipere, nam Verbum docet Dominum esse, caelum et infernum esse, vitam post mortem esse, fidem et charitatem esse, et plura alia, quae absque Verbo seu 
(m)revelatione prorsus non scirentur,(n) n. 8944; {2}quare qui (t)negant Verbum non recipere possunt aliquid quod Verbum docet, nam cum legunt illud aut audiunt illud, occurrit negativum, quod vel 
exstinguit verum vel vertit in falsum. Quapropter omnium primum apud hominem (x)Ecclesiae est 3 credere Verbum, et hoc primarium est apud illum qui in vero fidei et bono charitatis est, at apud illos 
qui in malis {3}amorum sui et mundi sunt, primarium est non credere Verbum, nam rejiciunt illud ilico cum de eo cogitant, et quoque blasphemant; si videret homo quantae et quales blasphemiae contra Verbum 
{4}sunt illis qui in malis illorum amorum sunt, horresceret; ipse homo cum in mundo est, id non scit quia latent post ideas cogitationis {5} activae, quae abit in loquelam cum hominibus; at usque 
revelantur in altera vita et apparent horrendae. Blasphemiae sunt duplicis generis: sunt quae ex intellectuali et 4 non simul ex voluntario prodeunt, et sunt quae {6}ex voluntario per intellectuale; 
hae blasphemiae sunt quae tam horrendae sunt, illae vero non; quae {7}ex voluntario per intellectuale prodeunt sunt ex malo vitae, at quae solum ex intellectuali et non simul ex voluntario, sunt ex 
falso doctrinae aut ex fallaciis {8}sensuum externorum, quae fallunt hominem in ignorantia constitutum.  Haec dicta sunt ut sciatur quomodo se habet cum blasphematione veri Divini, hoc est, Verbi, (c)ac
