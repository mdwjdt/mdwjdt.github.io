<h4 align="center"></h4><p><strong>6335.</strong>“雅各叫了他的儿子们来”表对属世层中的信之真理和爱之良善的有序安排。这从“叫”的含义，以及“雅各”和“他儿子们”的代表清楚可知：“叫”是指有序安排，因为把他们叫在一起，是为了让信之真理和仁之良善能以这种有序安排被呈现出来；“雅各”和“他的儿子们”是指属世层中的信之真理和爱之良善，“雅各”代表总体上的这些真理与良善（<a href="3509.htm">3509</a>，<a href="3525.htm">3525</a>，<a href="3546.htm">3546</a>，<a href="3659.htm">3659</a>，<a href="3669.htm">3669</a>，<a href="3677.htm">3677</a>，<a href="3775.htm">3775</a>，<a href="3829.htm">3829</a>，<a href="4234.htm">4234</a>，<a href="4273.htm">4273</a>，<a href="4337.htm">4337</a>，<a href="5506.htm">5506</a>，<a href="5533.htm">5533</a>，<a href="5535.htm">5535</a>，<a href="6001.htm">6001</a>，<a href="6236.htm">6236</a>节），他的儿子们，或以他们命名的支派代表细节上的这些真理和良善（<a href="3858.htm">3858</a>，<a href="3926.htm">3926</a>，<a href="3939.htm">3939</a>，<a href="4060.htm">4060</a>节）。关于此处所表示并且呈现在本章内义中的对信之真理和爱之良善的这种安排，要知道，以色列的十二支派代表总体上作为一个整体的全部真理和良善，因而代表从主发出的全部真理和良善，因此代表存在于天堂并构成天堂的全部真理和良善。由于代表总体上的全部，故也代表细节上的每一个；因为总体包含细节在里面，正如整体包含部分。<br />良善和源于良善的真理决定了天堂里的光的不同强度；而光的不同强度则决定了聪明和智慧的不同状态。正因如此，这光通过乌陵和土明闪烁，并且照着所提问题的进展状况而以各种不同方式发光和闪烁。这是因为表示总体上的全部真理和良善的十二支派被标记在胸牌，也就是乌陵和土明上；因为每颗宝石就代表一个支派。它们之所以是宝石，是因为它们表示属灵和属天的真理（<a href="114.htm">114</a>，<a href="3720.htm">3720</a>节）；它们被镶刻于其中的金子表示良善（参看<a href="113.htm">113</a>，<a href="1551.htm">1551</a>，<a href="1552.htm">1552</a>，<a href="5658.htm">5658</a>节）。这就是乌陵和土明所表示的秘密。<br />十二支派就具有这种含义，这一点从圣言中提及它们的经文，尤其从约书亚记中所描述的各支派在迦南地的产业，以及以西结书所描述的他们在主国度的产业明显看出来；在以西结书的最后一章，我们读到新地，新耶路撒冷，新殿；这些在启示录（启示录<a href="http://39-27.cn/启7.4.htm">7:4</a>-<a href="http://39-27.cn/启7.8.htm">8</a>）也有所描述。这一点也可从他们在旷野安营的顺序明显看出来，这顺序具有这样的性质：它代表在其正当次序中的真理和良善。这就是巴兰所说预言的起源：<br />巴兰举目，看见以色列人照着支派居住，神的灵就临到他身上。他便发出预言说，雅各啊，你的帐幕何等华美！以色列啊，你的居所何其华丽！如接连的山谷，如河旁的园子，如耶和华所栽的沉香树，如水边的香柏木。（民数记<a href="http://39-27.cn/民24.2.htm">24:2</a>-<a href="http://39-27.cn/民24.6.htm">6</a>）<br />也可参看前面关于各支派及其排列顺序的说明（<a href="2129.htm">2129</a>，<a href="3858.htm">3858</a>，<a href="3862.htm">3862</a>，<a href="3926.htm">3926</a>，<a href="3939.htm">3939</a>，<a href="4060.htm">4060</a>，<a href="4603.htm">4603</a>节）。</p>

<p align="center"><b>Potts(1905-1910) 6335</b></p><p><b>6335.</b>
And Jacob called his sons. That this signifies the setting in order of the truths of faith and goods of love in the natural, is evident from the signification of "calling," as being to set in order, 
for the reason of calling them together was that the truths of faith and goods of charity might be presented in this orderly arrangement; and from the representation of Jacob and his sons, as being the 
truths of faith and goods of love in the natural. (That Jacob represents these in general, may be seen, n. 3509, 3525, 3546, 3659, 3669, 3677, 3775, 3829, 4234, 4273, 4337, 5506, 5533, 5535, 6001, 6236; 
and also his sons, or the tribes named from them, the same in particular, n. 3858, 3926, 3939, 4060.) As regards the setting in order of the truths of faith and of the goods of love, which is here 
signified, and is presented in the internal sense in this chapter, be it known that the twelve tribes of Israel represented in general all truths and goods in one complex, thus all the truths and goods 
which proceed from the Lord, and consequently those which are in heaven, and of which heaven consists. And because they are all represented in general, they are also represented severally in particular; 
for generals contain in them particulars, as wholes contain parts. [2] The lights in heaven are varied in accordance with the goods and the derivative truths, and the states of intelligence and 
wisdom, in accordance with the lights; and it was from this that the light sparkled and quivered through the Urim and Thummim, and this with variety in accordance with the state of the matter about 
which the interrogation was made. This took place because the twelve tribes, by which were signified all truths and goods in general, were marked on that breastplate, that is, on the Urim and Thummim, 
for there was a single precious stone for each tribe. The reason why they were precious stones was that they signified spiritual and celestial truths (n. 114, 3720); and the gold in which they were set 
signified good (see n. 113, 1551, 1552, 5658). This is the secret that was signified by the Urim and Thummim. [3] That the twelve tribes had such a signification, is plain from the passages in the 
Word where they are mentioned; especially from the inheritance of the tribes in the land of Canaan, described in Joshua, and from their inheritance in the Lord's kingdom, described in the last chapters 
of Ezekiel, where we read of the new earth, the new Jerusalem, and the new temple; and in John in Revelation (Rev. 7:4-8); also from the order in which they encamped in the wilderness, which was of 
such a nature that they thereby represented truths and goods in their genuine order. Hence the prophetic utterance of Balaam: </p>
<p>     When Balaam lifted up his eyes, and saw Israel dwelling according to 
their tribes, the spirit of God came upon him. And he gave forth an enunciation, and said, How good are thy tabernacles O Jacob! thy habitations O Israel! As the valleys are they planted, as gardens 
beside the river, as sandalwood trees which Jehovah hath planted, as cedars beside the waters (Num. 24:2-6). (See also the things shown about the tribes and their ordering in n. 2129, 3858, 3862, 3926, 
3939, 4060, 4603.) </p>

'And Jacob called his sons' means organizing the truths of faith and the forms of the good of love in the natural. This is clear from the meaning of 'calling' as arranging into order, for the reason 
why they were called together was so that the truths of faith and the forms of the good of charity might be set forth in that organized arrangement; and from the representation of 'Jacob' and 'his sons' 
as the truths of faith and the forms of the good of love in the natural, 'Jacob' being those truths and forms of good in general, see <a href="3509.htm">3509</a>, <a href="3525.htm">3525</a>, <a href="3546.htm">3546</a>, <a href="3659.htm">3659</a>, <a href="3669.htm">3669</a>, <a href="3677.htm">3677</a>, <a href="3775.htm">3775</a>, <a href="3829.htm">3829</a>, <a href="4234.htm">4234</a>, <a href="4273.htm">4273</a>, <a href="4777.htm">4777</a>, <a href="5506.htm">5506</a>, <a href="5533.htm">5533</a>, <a href="5535.htm">5535</a>, <a href="6001.htm">6001</a>, <a href="6236.htm">6236</a>, and 'his sons', or the tribes named after them, those truths and forms of good in particular, <a href="3858.htm">3858</a>, <a href="3926.htm">3926</a>, <a href="3939.htm">3939</a>, <a href="4060.htm">4060</a>. With regard to this organization of the truths of 
faith and the forms of the good of love that is meant here and is set forth in the internal sense of this chapter, it should be recognized that the twelve tribes of Israel represented in general all 
truths and forms of good in their entirety, thus all the truths and forms of good which come forth from the Lord, therefore those which exist in heaven and from which heaven exists. And since all in general 
are represented, so is each one specifically; for classes in general include all members specifically, just as general wholes do their individual parts. </p>
<p></p>
<p><b>[2]</b>
 Forms of good and the truths deriving 
from them are what determine the varying intensity of light in heaven; and that varying intensity of light is what determines the varying states of intelligence and wisdom. This was how it came about 
that light glittered and flashed through the Urim and Thummim, doing so in varying ways in keeping with the state of the matter about which questions were being asked. This took place because the 
twelve tribes, by whom all truths and forms of good in general were meant, were designated in the breastplate or Urim and Thummim; for each precious stone stood for one particular tribe. The reason why 
they were precious stones was that spiritual and celestial truths are meant by them, <a href="114.htm">114</a>, <a href="3720.htm">3720</a>, and good is meant by the 'gold' into which they had been set,<A name="fntext1"></a><A href="#fn1"><sup>a</sup></a> <a href="113.htm">113</a>, <a href="1551.htm">1551</a>, <a href="1552.htm">1552</a>, <a href="5658.htm">5658</a>. This arcanum is 
what was meant by the Urim and Thummim. </p>
<p></p>
<p><b>[3]</b>
 The fact that the twelve tribes meant such things is evident from places in the Word where they are mentioned by name, in particular from the inheritances 
of the tribes in the land of Canaan, which are dealt with in Joshua, and from their inheritances in the Lord's kingdom, which are dealt with in Ezekiel - in the final chapters, in which a new land, 
a new Jerusalem, and a new temple are described - and also in <a href="http://bible.gospelcom.net/cgi-bin/bible?passage=Revelation%207:4-8&amp;version=ESV&amp;interface=print&amp;showfn=yes&amp;showxref">Revelation 7:4-8</a>. That the twelve tribes meant such things is also evident from the order in which they were arranged when they pitched camp 
in the wilderness, an order which was such that it represented truths and forms of good in their right and proper order. This was the origin of the prophetic utterance made by Balaam, </p>
<blockquote>
When Balaam 
lifted up his eyes and saw Israel dwelling according to their tribes, the Spirit of God came upon him and he delivered an utterance, and said, How good are your tabernacles, O Jacob; your dwelling-places, 
O Israel! Like valleys they are planted, like gardens beside a river, like aloes Jehovah has planted, like cedars beside the waters. <a href="http://bible.gospelcom.net/cgi-bin/bible?passage=Num%2024:2,%203,%205,%206&amp;version=ESV&amp;interface=print&amp;showfn=yes&amp;showxref">Num 24:2, 3, 5, 6</a>.

`Et vocavit Jacob filios suos':  quod significet ordinationem verorum fidei et bonorum amoris in naturali, constat a significatione `vocare' quod sit ordinare, nam causa convocationis erat ut sisterentur

designatae erant in pectorali illo, seu in Urim et Thummim, singularis enim lapis pretiosus erat pro unaquavis tribu; quod lapides pretiosi essent, erat quia {4} significant vera spiritualia et
