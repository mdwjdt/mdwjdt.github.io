<h3 align="center" class="ired">属天的奥秘 第7634节</h3>
<h4 align="center"></h4><p><strong>7634.</strong>“并要叫你在你儿子和你孙子的耳中讲述我在埃及所作的事”表叫那些处于真理和良善的人能知道那些属于教会并侵扰正直人的人所遭遇的事。这从“在耳中讲述”、“儿子和孙子”、“我在埃及所作的事”的含义清楚可知。“在耳中讲述”是指叫他们知道并关注。“儿子和孙子”是指那些处于真理和良善的人。“儿子”表示真理（参看<a href="489.htm">489</a>-<a href="491.htm">491</a>，<a href="1147.htm">1147</a>，<a href="2623.htm">2623</a>，<a href="3373.htm">3373</a>节），“孙子”表示衍生物（<a href="6583.htm">6583</a>节）；但此处“儿子”表示那些既处于真理，也处于良善的人，因为他们表示那些属于教会的人；这解释了为何摩西对“你的孙子”说，摩西代表神的律法，也就是从主的神性良善发出的神性真理，因而代表与神性良善结合的神性真理（<a href="7623.htm">7623</a>，<a href="7624.htm">7624</a>节），教会就从这真理和良善获得自己的存在。“我在埃及所作的事”是指那些在来世侵扰正直人的人所遭遇的事。“神迹”表示所遭遇的事，“法老和埃及人”是指那些在来世进行侵扰的人，这一点从前面所述清楚可知。那些进行侵扰的人曾是属教会的人（参看<a href="7633.htm">7633</a>节）。</p>

And that thou mayest tell in the ears of thy son, and of thy son's son, what things I have wrought in Egypt. That this signifies that they who are in truth and good may know what befalls those who are 
of the church and infest the upright, is evident from the signification of "telling in the ears," as being that they may know and take notice; and from the signification of "son," and "son's son," as 
being those who are in truth and good. (That "son" denotes truth, see n. 489-491, 1147, 2623, 3373; also that the "sons of sons" denote the things derived, n. 6583.) Here "sons" denote those who are 
in truth and also in good, because by them are signified those who are of the church; and therefore "thy son's son" is said to Moses, by whom is represented the law Divine, which is the Divine truth 
proceeding from the Lord's Divine good; thus it is the Divine truth to which is united the Divine good (n. 7623, 7624), from which is the church: and from the signification of "what things I have wrought 
in Egypt," as being that which befalls those who in the other life infest the upright. That by "signs" is signified that which befalls, and by "Pharaoh and the Egyptians" those who in the other life 
infest, is evident from what has been said before. (That they who infest have been of the church may be seen above, n. 7633.) </p>

'And in order that you may tell in the ears of your son and your son's son the deeds which I have performed in Egypt' means in order that those guided by truth and governed by good may know what happens 
to the ones belonging to the Church who molest the upright. This is clear from the meaning of 'telling in the ears' as in order that they may know and discern; from the meaning of 'son and son's son' 
as those guided by truth and governed by good ('son' means truth, see <a href="489.htm">489</a>-<a href="491.htm">491</a>, <a href="1147.htm">1147</a>, <a href="2623.htm">2623</a>, <a href="3373.htm">3373</a>, and 'the sons of sons' derivatives, <a href="6583.htm">6583</a>, but at this point 'sons' are those who are guided by truth 
and also governed by good, for those who belong to the Church are meant by them; this explains why 'your son's son' is included in what is said to Moses, who represents the law of God, that is, Divine 
Truth emanating from the Lord's Divine Good, thus Divine Truth to which Divine Good is united, <a href="7623.htm">7623</a>, <a href="7624.htm">7624</a>, from which Truth and Good the Church derives its existence); and from the meaning of 'the 
deeds which I have performed in Egypt' as what happens to those who in the next life molest the upright. The meaning of 'signs' as what happens, and of 'Pharaoh and the Egyptians' as those who engage 
in molestation in the next life, is evident from what has been stated in previous paragraphs in this chapter; and for the fact that those who engage in molestation are people who have belonged to the 
Church, see immediately above at the end of <a href="7633.htm">7633</a>. </p>

`Et propterea ut narres in auribus filii tui, et filii filii tui, quae operatus sum in Aegypto': quod significet ut sciant qui in vero et bono quid evenit illis (d)qui ab Ecclesia sunt ac infestant
