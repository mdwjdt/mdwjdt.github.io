<h4 align="center"></h4><p><strong>9693.</strong>穿过这大鸿沟之后，我终于到达一个我停下来的地方。这时，一些灵人从上面出现在我面前，我被允许与他们交谈。从他们的言语，以及他们看待并阐述事情的特有方式，我清楚意识到，他们来自另一个星球；因为他们与属我们太阳系的灵人完全不同。另一方面，他们也从我的言语意识到我来自远方。</p>

CONTINUATION CONCERNING THE FIRST EARTH SEEN IN THE STARRY HEAVEN. After I had been carried across that great chasm, I at last arrived at a place where I stayed; and then spirits appeared to me above, 
with whom it was granted to speak. From their speech, and their peculiar way of looking at things, and of setting them forth, I clearly perceived that they were from another earth; for they were quite 
different from the spirits of our solar system. On the other hand they too noticed from my speech that I had come from afar. </p>

THE FIRST PLANET OUT IN SPACE - continued  </p>
<p>After I had been taken across that great chasm I arrived at length at a place where I came to a halt. At that point spirits on a level above appeared to 
me, to whom I was allowed to speak. From their mode of speech and from the way in which they were inclined to observe things and express them I realized clearly that they were from another planet; for 
they were altogether different from spirits belonging to our solar system. And they in turn recognized from my mode of speech that I was from far away.  </p>

Postquam per magnum illum hiatum translatus fui, tandem perveni ad locum ubi morabar; et tunc apparebant mihi spiritus superne, cum quibus loqui datum est; ex loquela eorum, et ex genio appercipiendi 
res et exponendi illas, clare animadverti quod essent ex alia tellure, nam prorsus differebant a spiritibus mundi nostri solis; illi etiam vicissim ex mea loquela appercipiebant quod e longinquo essem. </p>
