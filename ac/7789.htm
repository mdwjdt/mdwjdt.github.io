<h3 align="center" class="ired">属天的奥秘 第7789节</h3>
<h4 align="center"></h4><p><strong>7789.</strong>“说，求你和所有在你脚下的百姓，都出去”表祈求让他们离开那些处于从神来的真理之人，从最高的到最低的。这从“出去”、“百姓”和“在你脚下”的含义，以及“摩西”的代表清楚可知：“出去”是指离开；“摩西”，即此处的“你”，是指神的真理；“百姓”是指那些处于从神来的真理之人，因为以色列人，即此处的“百姓”代表那些属于属教会的人，也就是那些处于良善之真理和真理之良善的人，在此代表那些处于从神来的真理之人，因为经上说“在你脚下的百姓”，“摩西”代表神的真理；“在你脚下”是指那些占据较低地位或在下面的人，因而是指那些处于从属地位的人。“脚”表示属世事物，故表示较为低级的事物，因为自然界在灵界之下，“脚”表示属世事物（参看<a href="2162.htm">2162</a>，<a href="3761.htm">3761</a>，<a href="3986.htm">3986</a>，<a href="4280.htm">4280</a>，<a href="4938.htm">4938</a>-<a href="4952.htm">4952</a>节）。这一切解释了为何经上说“在你脚下在的百姓”。但他们也表示从最高的到最低的，“摩西”是指最高的，因为他代表神之真理，“在他脚下的百姓”代表每一个处于从神来的真理之人。</p>

Saying, Get thee out, and all the people that is at thy feet. That this signifies supplication that those may depart who are in truth from the Divine, from the highest to the lowest, is evident from 
the signification of "going out," as being to depart; from the representation of Moses, who is here meant by "thee," as being truth Divine; from the signification of "people," as being those who are in 
truth from the Divine; for by the sons of Israel, who are here "the people," are represented those who are of the spiritual church, thus who are in the truth of good and in the good of truth, here those 
who are in the truth from the Divine, because it is said "the people who are at thy feet," for by Moses is represented truth Divine; and from the signification of "at thy feet," as being those who 
are beneath, thus who are subordinate. For the "feet" signify lower because natural things, because the natural world is beneath the spiritual world (that the "feet" signify natural things see n. 2162, 
3761, 3986, 4280, 4938-4952); and for this reason it is said, "the people who are at thy feet." From the highest to the lowest is also signified; by "Moses" the highest, because he represents truth 
Divine; by "the people at his feet," all and each of those who are in truth from the Divine. </p>

'Saying, Go out, you, and all the people at your feet!' means pleading to let them depart from those guided by the truth from God, highest to lowest. This is clear from the meaning of 'going out' as 
departing; from the representation of Moses, to whom 'you' refers here, as God's truth; from the meaning of 'the people' as those guided by the truth from God (for the children of Israel, to whom 'the 
people' refers here, represent those who belong to the spiritual Church, that is, those who are guided by the truth of good and governed by the good of truth, at this point those guided by the truth 
from God since the expression 'the people at your feet' is used and 'Moses' represents God's truth); and from the meaning of 'at your feet' as those who occupy a lower position, thus who are subordinate, 
since 'feet', meaning natural things, therefore means lower ones. For the natural world lies below the spiritual world, and 'feet' means natural things, see <a href="2162.htm">2162</a>, <a href="7761.htm">7761</a>, <a href="3986.htm">3986</a>, <a href="4280.htm">4280</a>, <a href="4938.htm">4938</a>-<a href="4952.htm">4952</a>. All 
this explains why the words 'the people at your feet' are used. But they also mean highest to lowest, 'Moses' being the highest since he represents God's truth, 'the people at his feet' every single person 
who is guided by the truth from God. </p>

`Dicendo, Exi tu et omnis populus qui in pedibus tuis': quod significet supplicationem quod discedant ab illis qui in vero a Divino sunt, a summo ad imum, constat ex significatione `exire' quod sit 
discedere; ex repraesentatione `Moschis,' qui hic est `tu,' quod sit verum Divinum, ex significatione `populi' quod sint qui in vero a Divino; per `filios' enim `Israelis,' qui hic {1}sunt `populus,' 
repraesentantur qui ab Ecclesia spirituali, ita qui in vero boni et in bono veri, hic qui in vero a Divino, quia dicitur `populus qui in pedibus tuis,' per `Moschen' enim repraesentatur {2} verum Divinum; 
et ex significatione `in pedibus tuis' quod sint qui infra sunt, ita qui subordinati; `pedes' enim significant inferiora, quia naturalia, mundus enim naturalis est infra mundum spiritualem; quod 
`pedes' significent naturalia, videatur n. 2162, 3761, 3986, 4280, 4938-4952; inde {3}est quod dicatur `populus qui in pedibus tuis'; significatur etiam a summo ad imum, per `Moschen' summum, quia verum 
Divinum, per `populum in pedibus ejus' omnes et singuli qui in {4}vero a Divino. 	@1 est$ 	@2 i, ut dictum,$ 	@3 in lingua originali, dicitur$ 	@4 illo et sub illo$ </p>
