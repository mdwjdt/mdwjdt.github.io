<h3 align="center" class="ired">属天的奥秘 第8215节</h3>
<h4 align="center"></h4><p><strong>8215.</strong>“又使他的轮脱落”表推进虚假的能力被夺走。这从“脱落”、“轮”和“法老的战车”的含义清楚可知：“脱落”是指夺走；“轮”是指前行的能力，如下文所述；“法老的战车”是指支持虚假的教义事物（参看<a href="8146.htm">8146</a>，<a href="8148.htm">8148</a>节），因而是指虚假。至于“轮”在一般意义上表示什么，这从“马车”的含义可以看出来。马车分为两种：一种用来运送货物，一种用于战争。用来运货的马车表示传达真理的教义事物，在反面意义上表示传达虚假的教义事物；用于战争的马车也表示这两个意义上的教义事物，但表示进行争战的教义事物，因而表示为战争所预备的真理本身和虚假本身。由此可见“轮”表示什么，即前行的能力，在此表示推进虚假并与真理争战的能力。由于这种能力属于人心智的理解力部分，故就这些教义事物而言，“轮”也表示理解力部分。<br />在来世，满载各种货物的马车经常出现；这些马车在形状和尺寸上各不相同；它们出现时，表示整体上的真理，或教义事物，这些教义事物可以说是真理的容器；而它们所载的货物表示具有各种不同功用的认知或知识。当天使谈论教义时，这些事物就在天堂出现。事实上，由于他们下面的人无法理解天使的对话，所以就用代表来表现它。如前所述，对有些人来说，它表现为马车，这些马车以一种形式将谈话的每一个细节呈现在眼前；谈话内容通过这种代表能在一瞬间被理解和看见。有些细节以马车的形式显现，有些以马车的构造显现，有些以马车的颜色显现，有些以车轮显现，有些以拉车的马匹显现，有些以马车所载的货物显现。在圣言中，“马车或战车”表示教义事物正是源于这些代表。<br />由此在某种程度上可以看出，“轮”表示理解力所拥有的能力；因为正如马车通过车轮来移动和前行，包含在教义事物中的真理通过理解力来付诸行动。这也是以赛亚书中“轮”的含义：<br />他们的箭锐利，弓都上了弦；马蹄算如火石，轮好像旋风。（以赛亚书<a href="http://39-27.cn/赛5.28.htm">5:28</a>）<br />这论及使真理荒废的人：“箭”是指虚假，“弓”是指虚假的教义（<a href="2686.htm">2686</a>，<a href="2709.htm">2709</a>节）；而“马蹄”是指属于败坏理解力的感官记忆知识（<a href="7729.htm">7729</a>节）；“轮”是指好像旋风的败坏并摧毁真理的能力。<br />以西结书：<br />我正观看活物的时候，看哪，有四张脸的活物旁边各有一个轮子在地上。轮的形状和做法好像水苍玉。四个都是一个样式，其形状和作法好像轮中套轮。轮行走的时候，向四方都能直行，行时并不掉转。至于轮辋，高而可畏；其轮辋满有眼睛在它们的四个周围。活物行走的时候，轮子与它们同行。活物的灵在轮中。（以西结书<a href="http://39-27.cn/结1.15.htm">1:15</a>-<a href="http://39-27.cn/结1.20.htm">20</a>；<a href="http://39-27.cn/结10.9.htm">10:9</a>-<a href="http://39-27.cn/结10.17.htm">17</a>）<br />“四活物”，就是基路伯表示主的天命或旨意（<a href="308.htm">308</a>节）；“轮”表示神性聪明或预见；这就是为何经上说“轮子与活物同行”，“其轮辋满有眼睛”，以及“活物的灵在轮中”，活物的灵就是智慧的真理。<br />但以理书：<br />我观看，直到宝座设立，上头坐着亘古常在者，祂的衣服洁白如雪，头发如纯净的羊毛，宝座乃火焰，其轮乃烈火。（但以理书<a href="http://39-27.cn/但7.9.htm">7:9</a>）<br />此处“亘古常在者”是指神性良善方面的主；“设立的宝座”是指虚假；“祂的衣服”是指外在形式上的神之真理；“祂的宝座”是指天堂和教会；“祂的轮”是指智慧和聪明的事物，也就是神之真理；“烈火”是指爱与仁的事物。<br />所罗门的圣殿周围十个盆座下面也有铜轮；轮的做法像车轮的做法；其轴、辋、辐、毂都是铸的。（列王记上<a href="http://39-27.cn/王上7.30.htm">7:30</a>-<a href="http://39-27.cn/王上7.33.htm">33</a>）<br />这些“盆座”或架子表示真理的容器，人通过真理被洁净和重生；“轮”表示用来推进的理解力的能力。</p>

<p align="center"><b>Potts(1905-1910) 8215</b></p><p><b>8215.</b>
And He took off the wheel of his chariots. That this signifies the power of inflicting falsities taken away, is evident from the signification of "to take off," as being to take away; from the signification 
of "a wheel," as being the power of advancing (of which below); and from the signification of "the chariots of Pharaoh," as being doctrinal things of falsity (see n. 8146, 8148), thus falsities. 
What a "wheel" signifies in the genuine sense, can be seen from the signification of a "chariot." Chariots were of two kinds: there were chariots for conveying merchandise, and chariots for war. By 
chariots for conveying merchandise were signified doctrinal things of truth, and in the opposite sense doctrinal things of falsity; and by chariots for war were also signified doctrinal things in both 
senses, but fighting ones, thus the truths themselves, and the falsities themselves, prepared for war. From this it can be seen what is meant by "the wheel of a chariot," namely, the power of advancing, 
here of inflicting falsities and of fighting against truths. As this power belongs to man's intellectual part, by a "wheel" is also signified the intellectual part in respect to those things which 
are of doctrine.  [2] In the other life there frequently appear chariots laden with merchandise of various kinds; the chariots differ in form and size; and when they appear, there are signified by 
them truths in their complex, or doctrinal things, which are as it were receptacles of truth; and by the merchandise are signified knowledges of various use. These things appear when the angels discourse 
in heaven about doctrines; for as their discourse cannot be comprehended by those who are beneath, it is presented representatively, and as before said, to some by means of chariots, in which each 
and all things of the discourse are presented in a form, and before the eyes, from which the contents of the discourse can be comprehended and seen in a moment; some in the form of the chariot; some 
in its construction; some in its color; some in its wheels; some in the horses which draw it; some in the merchandise which the chariot conveys. It is from these representatives that "chariots" in the 
Word signify doctrinal things.  [3] From this it can in some measure be seen that by the "wheel of chariots" is signified the power of understanding; for as a chariot moves and goes forward by means 
of the wheels, so the truths which are of doctrinal things move forward by means of the understanding. This is also signified by "wheels" in Isaiah: </p>
<p>     Whose arrows are sharp, and all the bows bent; 
the hoofs of his horses are accounted as rock; his wheels as a whirlwind (Isa. 5:28); </p>
<p>speaking of him who vastates truth: "arrows" denote falsities; and a "bow" the doctrine of falsity (n. 2686, 2709); 
"the hoofs of the horses" denote sensuous memory-knowledges from a perverted understanding (n. 7729); "wheels," the powers of perverting and destroying truths, like a whirlwind.  [4] In Ezekiel: </p>
<p> 
    I saw the living creatures, when behold one wheel on the earth with the living creatures, beside the four faces thereof. The appearance of the wheels and their work was as the look of a beryl; 
and they four had the same likeness; moreover their appearance and their work was as it were a wheel in the midst of a wheel; where they went, they went upon their four squares; they turned not when 
they went. [As for] their circles, they had height and they had fear; moreover their circles were full of eyes round about for them four: thus when the living creatures went, the wheels went with them; 
the spirit of the living creatures was in the wheels (Ezek. 1:15-20; also 10:9-17); </p>
<p>by the "four living creatures" which were cherubs, is signified the providence of the Lord (n. 308); by the "wheels," 
Divine intelligence, or foresight; from which it is said that "the wheels went together with the living creatures," and that "their circles were full of eyes," also that "the spirit of the living 
creature was in them," that is, the truth of wisdom.  [5] In Daniel: </p>
<p>     I saw even until the thrones were cast forth, and the Ancient of days did sit: His garment like the white snow; the hair of 
His head like the clean wool; His throne flames of fire; His wheels burning fire (Dan. 7:9); </p>
<p>here "the Ancient of days" denotes the Lord as to Divine good; "the thrones cast forth" denote falsities; 
"His garment" denotes truth Divine in the external form; "the hair of His head" denotes good Divine in the external form; "His throne" denotes heaven and the church; the "wheels" denote the things of 
wisdom and of intelligence, thus truths Divine; "burning fire" denotes the things of love and charity.      Under the ten basins around the temple of Solomon there were also wheels of brass; the work 
of the wheels was like the work of a chariot wheel; their hands, and their backs, and their tires, and their spokes, were all molten (1 Kings 7:30-33); </p>
<p>by these "basins" or "bases" were signified receptacles 
of the truth, by means of which a man is purified and regenerated; by the "wheels" were signified the intellectual powers, whereby is advancement. </p>

<p align="center"><b>Elliott(1983-1999) 8215</b></p><p><b>8215.</b>
'And He took off the wheels of his chariots' means that the power to advance falsities was taken away. This is clear from the meaning of 'taking off' as taking away; from the meaning of 'wheel' as the 
power to go forward, dealt with below; and from the meaning of 'Pharaoh's chariots' as doctrinal teachings that uphold falsity, dealt with in <a href="8146.htm">8146</a>, <a href="8148.htm">8148</a>, thus as falsities. What 'wheel' means in the 
genuine sense may be recognized from the meaning of 'chariot'. There were two kinds of chariots<A name="fntext1"></a><A href="#fn1"><sup>a</sup></a> - those used to carry merchandise, and those used in battle. Chariots used for carrying merchandise served 
to mean doctrinal teachings that conveyed the truth, or in the contrary sense to mean those that conveyed falsity. Chariots used in battle likewise served to mean doctrinal teachings in either of 
those senses, but teachings involved in conflict. That is, they were used to mean actual truths or actual falsities lined up for conflict. From this one may see what 'a chariot wheel' is used to mean, 
namely the power to move forward, here to advance falsities and fight against truths. Since this power belongs to the understanding part of a person's mind, 'wheel' also means the understanding so far 
as matters of doctrine are concerned. </p>
<p></p>
<p><b>[2]</b>
 In the next life chariots are frequently seen, laden with various kinds of merchandise; and these chariots differ from one another in outward appearance 
and size. When they are seen they serve to mean truths in their entirety, or doctrinal teachings, which are so to speak receptacles of truth, while their 'merchandise' serves to mean knowledge or cognitions 
that have different kinds of use. These things are seen in heaven when religious teachings are the object of conversation among angels. For since angels' conversation is incomprehensible to people 
who are below them, representatives are used to present it. To some it is presented, as has been stated, by means of chariots, which represent visually to them every single detail of the conversation; 
from that representation the contents of the conversation can be understood and seen in an instant. Some details are seen in the outward appearance of the chariot, some in its structure, some in 
its colour, some in its wheels, some in the horses pulling it, and others in the merchandise that the chariot is carrying. From these representatives springs the use of 'chariots' in the Word to mean 
doctrinal teachings. </p>
<p></p>
<p><b>[3]</b>
 From all this one may in some measure be able to see that 'chariot wheels' means power that the understanding possesses; for just as a chariot is moved and sent forward by 
means of its wheels, so are the truths contained in doctrinal teachings sent into action by the power of understanding. This is also the meaning of 'wheels' in Isaiah, </p>
<p>Whose arrows are sharp, and 
all bows bent. His horses' hoofs are considered as flint, kits wheels as the whirlwind. <a href="http://bible.gospelcom.net/cgi-bin/bible?passage=Isa%205:28&amp;version=ESV&amp;interface=print&amp;showfn=yes&amp;showxref">Isa 5:28</a>. </p>
<p>This refers to one who lays truth waste, 'arrows' being falsities, and 'bows' false doctrine, <a href="2686.htm">2686</a>, <a href="2709.htm">2709</a>, while 'the hoofs' of the horses are the sensory knowledge belonging to perverted powers of understanding, <a href="7729.htm">7729</a>, 'wheels' powers to pervert and destroy truths, like a whirlwind. </p>
<p></p>
<p><b>[4]</b>
 In Ezekiel, </p>
<blockquote>
I 
saw the living creatures, and behold, one wheel was on the earth with [each of] the living creatures, beside its four faces. The appearance of the wheels and their works were like a kind of tarshish,<A name="fntext2"></a><A href="#fn2"><sup>b</sup></a> 
and the four had the same likeness. In addition the appearance of them, and their works, was like a wheel in the middle of a wheel. They went along on four sides in the direction they went; 
they did not turn aside as they went. Their rims were so high that they were awesome;<A name="fntext3"></a><A href="#fn3"><sup>c</sup></a> in addition their rims were full of eyes round about all four of them. Thus when the living creatures went, the 
wheels went along with them. The spirit of the living creatures was in the wheels. <a href="http://bible.gospelcom.net/cgi-bin/bible?passage=Ezek%201:15-21;%2010:9-14&amp;version=ESV&amp;interface=print&amp;showfn=yes&amp;showxref">Ezek 1:15-21; 10:9-14</a>. 
</blockquote>
<p>The Lord's providence is meant by 'the four living creatures', which were cherubs, <a href="308.htm">308</a>, 
and Divine intelligence, or foresight, by 'the wheels'. This is why it says that the wheels went along together with the living creatures, that their rims were full of eyes, and also that the spirit of 
the living creatures, which was the truth of wisdom, was in them. </p>
<p></p>
<p><b>[5]</b>
 In Daniel, </p>
<blockquote>
I saw, until thrones were placed, and the Ancient of Days was seated His clothing was white as snow, the hair of 
His head like pure wool. His throne was flames of fire; His wheels were burning fire. <a href="http://bible.gospelcom.net/cgi-bin/bible?passage=Dan%207:9&amp;version=ESV&amp;interface=print&amp;showfn=yes&amp;showxref">Dan 7:9</a>. 
</blockquote>
<p>'The Ancient of Days' here is the Lord in respect of Divine Goodness; 'the thrones' that were placed 
are falsities; 'His clothing' is God's truth in its outward appearance; 'the hair of His head' is God's goodness in its outward appearance; 'His throne' is heaven and the Church; 'His wheels' are forms 
of wisdom and intelligence, that is, God's truths, and 'burning fire' the flames of love and charity. Under the ten lavers around Solomon's temple there were also </p>
<p>Wheels of bronze. The workmanship 
of the wheels was like the workmanship of a chariot wheel; their axles,<A name="fntext4"></a><A href="#fn4"><sup>d</sup></a> and their rims<A name="fntext5"></a><A href="#fn5"><sup>e</sup></a>, and their tires, and their spokes were all of cast [bronze]. I Kings 7:30-33. </p>
<p>Those 'lavers' or 
stands served to mean the receptacles of truth by means of which a person is purified and regenerated. 'The wheels' served to mean the powers of understanding by means of which advances are made.

`Et dimovit rotam curruum illis': quod significet potentiam inferendi falsa ablatam, constat ex significatione `dimovere' quod sit auferre; ex significatione `rotae' quod sit potentia progrediendi, 
de qua sequitur; ex significatione `curruum Pharaonis' quod sint doctrinalia falsi, de qua n. 8146, 8148, ita falsa {1}.  Quid `rota' in genuino sensu significat, constare potest ex significatione `currus'; 
currus {2}fuerunt duplicis generis: {2}fuerunt per quos {3}vehebantur merces, et {2}fuerunt per quos {4} pugnabant; per currus per quos {3}vehebantur merces, {5}significabantur doctrinalia veri, 
et in opposito sensu doctrinalia falsi; per currus autem per quos pugnabant, {5}significabantur etiam doctrinalia in utroque sensu, sed pugnantia, ita ipsa vera et ipsa falsa instructa ad pugnas; inde 
constare potest quid intelligitur per `rotam currus,' quod nempe potentia {6}progrediendi, hic inferendi falsa et pugnandi contra vera; haec potentia quia est partis intellectualis hominis, inde per 
`rotam' quoque intellectuale quoad illa quae sunt doctrinae significatur. 	2 In altera vita apparent multoties currus onerati varii generis mercibus, et illi in dissimili forma et magnitudine; per 
illos, cum apparent, significantur vera in suo complexu seu doctrinalia, quae quasi {7}receptacula veri sunt, et per `merces' cognitiones varii usus; haec apparent cum in caelo apud angelos sermo est 
de doctrinis; sermo enim illorum, quia non potest comprehendi ab illis (x)qui infra sunt, sistitur repraesentative, et quibusdam {8} per currus, ut dictum est, in quibus omnia et singula sermonis {9} 
in forma et ante oculos sistuntur, unde momento comprehendi et {10} videri possunt contenta sermonis, quaedam in currus forma, quaedam in ejus contextura, quaedam in ejus (x)colore, quaedam in ejus rotis, 
quaedam in equis qui trahunt, quaedam in mercibus quas currus vehit; ex his repraesentativis est quod `currus' in Verbo significent doctrinalia; 3 inde potest aliquatenus videri quod per `curruum 
{11}rotam' significetur potentia quae {12} intellectuali, nam sicut currus motum suum et progressionem habet per rotas, ita vera quae doctrinalium progressionem per intellectuale; hoc quoque significatur 
per `rotas' apud Esaiam, Cujus tela acuta, et omnes arcus tensi, ungulae equorum ejus sicut rupes reputantur, rotae ejus sicut procella, v 28; </p>
<p>ibi de vastatore veri agitur; `tela' sunt falsa, et 
`arcus' doctrina falsi, n. 2686, 2709; `ungulae equorum' sunt scientifica sensualia ex intellectuali perverso, n. 7729; `rotae' sunt potentiae {13} pervertendi destruendique vera, sicut procella: apud 
Ezechielem, 4 Vidi animalia, cum ecce rota una in terra apud animalia juxta quattuor facies ejus; aspectus rotarum et opera illarum sicut species Tharschisch, et similitudo eadem quattuor illis; insuper 
(x)aspectus illarum et opera illarum, quasi esset rota in medio rotae; super quattuor quadraturis illarum qua ibant ibant; non convertebant se cum ibant: apsides illarum, et altitudo illis, et 
timor illis; insuper apsides illarum plenae oculis circumcirca quattuor illis: ita cum ibant animalia, ibant rotae apud illa; spiritus animalis in rotis, i 15-21, tum x 9-14; </p>
<p>per `quattuor animalia,' 
quae fuerunt cherubi, significatur providentia Domini, n. 308, per `rotas' Divina intelligentia, seu praevidentia; inde dicitur quod `rotae irent simul cum animalibus,' et quod `apsides illarum essent 
plenae oculis,' tum quod `spiritus animalis in illis,' hoc est, verum sapientiae: apud Danielem, 5 Videns fui, usque dum throni projecti sunt, et Antiquus dierum sedit; vestis Ipsius sicut nix alba,
