<h3 align="center" class="ired">属天的奥秘 第2906节</h3>
<h4 align="center"></h4><p><strong>2906.</strong>“这是撒拉一生的岁数”表当地上尚有神性真理存留之时。这从“岁”或年（a year）、“岁数”或年数（years）和“撒拉一生”（lives of Sarah）的含义清楚可知：“岁”或年（a year）是指教会自始至终的整个时期；“岁数”或年数（years）是指各个时期（参看<a href="2905.htm">2905</a>）；“撒拉一生”（lives of Sarah）是指神性真理的各个状态，如刚才所述（<a href="2904.htm">2904</a>节），因而在此表示神性真理荡然无存的终了之时，这也可从前面的内容推知。<br />“岁”或年（a year）表教会自始至终的整个时期，或也可说，整个时期；因而“岁数”或年数（years）表总的时期内的各个时间段或各个时期。这一点从以下圣言经文可以看出来，以赛亚书：<br />耶和华膏了我，叫我传好消息给困苦的人；差遣我包扎心碎的人，报告被掳的得释放，被囚的得开释；报告耶和华的喜年，和我们神报仇的日子。（以赛亚书<a href="http://39-27.cn/赛61.1.htm">61:1</a>-<a href="http://39-27.cn/赛61.2.htm">2</a>）<br />这论及主的到来。“耶和华的喜年”表新教会的时间。同一先知书：<br />报仇之日在我心中，我救赎之年已经来到。（以赛亚书<a href="http://39-27.cn/赛63.4.htm">63:4</a>）<br />这也论及主的到来。“救赎之年”表新教会的时间。<br />这是耶和华的报仇之日，也是为锡安争辩的报应之年。（以赛亚书<a href="http://39-27.cn/赛34.8.htm">34:8</a>）<br />此处的含义也一样。<br />这个时间还被称为“追讨之年”（year of visitation），耶利米书：<br />在追讨之年，我必使灾祸临到亚拿突人。（耶利米书<a href="http://39-27.cn/耶11.23.htm">11:23</a>）<br />同一先知书：<br />我必使追讨之年临到摩押。（耶利米书<a href="http://39-27.cn/耶48.44.htm">48:44</a>）<br />在以西结书中看得更清楚：<br />过了多日，你必被差派。到末后之年，你必来到脱离刀剑之地，就是从多民中招聚出来之人的地，到以色列常久荒凉的山上。（以西结书<a href="http://39-27.cn/结38.8.htm">38:8</a>）<br />“末后之年”表教会的末期，这时，教会已不再是教会，那些以前属教会的人被弃绝，从其它地方来的人则被接受。以赛亚书：<br />主对我这样说，一年之内，照雇工的年数，基达的一切荣耀必消没。（以赛亚书<a href="http://39-27.cn/赛21.16.htm">21:16</a>）<br />这也表示末期。<br />以西结书：<br />你因流了人的血，就为有罪；又因你所造的偶像，就玷污自己；使你的日子临近，你到了你的年岁；所以我叫你受列族的凌辱和各地的讥诮。（以西结书<a href="http://39-27.cn/结22.4.htm">22:4</a>）<br />“到了年岁”表到了主离弃教会的终了之时。以赛亚书：<br />现在耶和华宣告说，三年之内，照雇工的年数，摩押的荣耀与他的群众必被藐视，余剩的人甚少无几。（以赛亚书<a href="http://39-27.cn/赛16.14.htm">16:14</a>）<br />“三年之内”也表前教会的终结。“三”既表终结之物，也表开始之物（参看<a href="1825.htm">1825</a>，<a href="2788.htm">2788</a>节）。<br />“七”，以及“七十”也有同样的含义（参看<a href="720.htm">720</a>，<a href="728.htm">728</a>，<a href="901.htm">901</a>节）。所以，在以赛亚书，经上说:<br />到那日，推罗必被忘记七十年，照着一王的年日；七十年终了之后，推罗必像妓女所唱的歌。七十年终了以后，耶和华便眷顾推罗，使她再得妓女的淫资。（以赛亚书<a href="http://39-27.cn/赛23.15.htm">23:15</a>-<a href="http://39-27.cn/赛23.17.htm">17</a>）<br />“七十年”表整个时期，从教会开始之时直到它气绝之时，这也是“一王的年日”，因为“王”表教会的真理（参看<a href="1672.htm">1672</a>，<a href="1728.htm">1728</a>，<a href="2015.htm">2015</a>，<a href="2069.htm">2069</a>节）。犹太人被掳的“七十年”也涉及类似的事。在耶利米书，论到被掳的，经上同样说： <br />这些民族要服事巴比伦王七十年；七十年满了以后，我必刑罚巴比伦王和那民族的罪孽，这是耶和华说的。（耶利米书<a href="http://39-27.cn/耶25.11.htm">25:11</a>-<a href="http://39-27.cn/耶25.12.htm">12</a>；<a href="http://39-27.cn/耶29.10.htm">29:10</a>）.<br />“岁”或年，以及“岁数”或年数表教会的整个时期，或它持续的时间。这可从玛拉基书进一步看出来：<br />看哪，我要差遣我的使者在我前面预备道路；你们所寻求的主，立约的使者，就是你们所仰慕的，必忽然进入祂的殿；看哪，祂快乐要来到，这是万军之耶和华说的；祂来的日子，谁能当得起呢？那时，犹大和耶路撒冷所献的供物，必蒙耶和华悦纳，仿佛上古之日、古时之年。（玛拉基书<a href="http://39-27.cn/玛3.1.htm">3:1</a>-<a href="http://39-27.cn/玛3.2.htm">2</a>，<a href="http://39-27.cn/玛3.4.htm">4</a>）<br />这论述的是主的到来。“上古之日”表上古教会；“古时之年”表古教会；“犹大的供物”表出于属天之爱的敬拜；“耶路撒冷的供物”表出于属灵之爱的敬拜；显然，此处并非指犹大，也不是指耶路撒冷。诗篇：<br />我追想上古之日，古时之年。（诗篇<a href="http://39-27.cn/诗77.5.htm">77:5</a>）<br />此处“上古之日”和“古时之年”同样表这两个教会。这一点从摩西书中看得更明显：<br />你当追想上古之日，思念历代之年。问你的父亲，他必指示你；问你的长者，他们必告诉你。至高者将地业赐给列族，将世人分开。（申命记<a href="http://39-27.cn/申32.7.htm">32:7</a>-<a href="http://39-27.cn/申32.8.htm">8</a>）<br />“岁”或年和“岁数”或年数表教会的全部时期，这也明显可见于哈巴谷书：<br />耶和华啊，我听见你的名声，就惧怕。耶和华啊，求你在这些年间复兴你的作为，在这些年间显明出来；在发怒的时候以怜悯为念。神从提幔而来，圣者从巴兰山临到。（哈巴谷书<a href="http://39-27.cn/哈3.2.htm">3:2</a>-<a href="http://39-27.cn/哈3.3.htm">3</a>）<br />这论及主的到来。“在年间”表在时间的完满中，至于何谓时间的完满，可参前文（<a href="2905.htm">2905</a>节）。<br />由于当用来论及主在地上的国度，也就是教会时，“岁”或年和“岁数”或年数表从开始到结束的全部时期，所以当论及主在天上的国度时，它们表示永恒之物。如诗篇：<br />我的神啊，你的年数世世无穷。你就祂，你的年数没有穷尽！你仆人的子孙要长存，他们的种要坚立在你面前。（诗篇<a href="http://39-27.cn/诗102.24.htm">102:24</a>，<a href="http://39-27.cn/诗102.27.htm">27</a>-<a href="http://39-27.cn/诗102.28.htm">28</a>）<br /><br />你要加添王的寿数，他的年岁必存到世世；他必永远住在神面前。（诗篇<a href="http://39-27.cn/诗61.6.htm">61:6</a>-<a href="http://39-27.cn/诗61.7.htm">7</a>）<br />此处“年岁”表永恒之物，因为这些话论述的是主及其国度。<br />把献为燔祭和祭物的一岁羊羔 （参看利未记<a href="http://39-27.cn/利12.6.htm">12:6</a>；<a href="http://39-27.cn/利14.10.htm">14:10</a>；民数记<a href="http://39-27.cn/民6.12.htm">6:12</a>；<a href="http://39-27.cn/民7.15.htm">7:15</a>，<a href="http://39-27.cn/民7.21.htm">21</a>，<a href="http://39-27.cn/民7.27.htm">27</a>，<a href="http://39-27.cn/民7.33.htm">33</a>，<a href="http://39-27.cn/民7.39.htm">39</a>，<a href="http://39-27.cn/民7.45.htm">45</a>，<a href="http://39-27.cn/民7.51.htm">51</a>，<a href="http://39-27.cn/民7.57.htm">57</a>，<a href="http://39-27.cn/民7.63.htm">63</a>，<a href="http://39-27.cn/民7.69.htm">69</a>，<a href="http://39-27.cn/民7.75.htm">75</a>，<a href="http://39-27.cn/民7.81.htm">81</a>等）表主国度中纯真的属天之物，这属天之物是永恒的。由于这个原因，一岁牛犊的燔祭在弥迦书中被提及，因为它是最蒙悦纳的（弥迦书<a href="http://39-27.cn/弥6.6.htm">6:6</a>）.<br />就内义而言，“岁”或年并非表示一年。这也可从以下事实明显看出来：拥有圣言内义的天使没有任何年的概念；但由于一年在尘世中是时间的全部时期，故他们具有涉及教会各个状态的全部之物，以及涉及天堂各个状态的永恒之物的概念，而没有一年的概念。对他们来说，时间就是状态（参看<a href="1274.htm">1274</a>，<a href="1382.htm">1382</a>，<a href="2625.htm">2625</a>，<a href="2788.htm">2788</a>，<a href="2837.htm">2837</a>节）。</p>

<p align="center"><b>Potts(1905-1910) 2906</b></p><p><b>2906.</b>
The years of the lives of Sarah. That this signifies while any truth Divine remained, is evident from the signification of a "year," as being an entire period of the church from beginning to end; thus 
from the signification of the "years," as being periods (see above, n. 2905); and from the signification of the "lives of Sarah," as being states as to truth Divine (of which also just above, n. 2904); 
thus denoting here the limit when there was no longer any truth Divine remaining; which also follows from what immediately precedes. [2] That a "year" signifies the entire time of a state of the 
church from beginning to end, or what is the same, an entire period; and consequently that "years" signify times or periods within the general period, may be seen from the following passages in the Word. 
In Isaiah: </p>
<p>     Jehovah hath anointed Me to preach good tidings unto the afflicted; He hath sent Me to bind up the brokenhearted, to proclaim liberty to the captives, and an opening of every kind 
to the bound, to proclaim the year of Jehovah's good pleasure, and the day of vengeance to our God (Isa. 61:1-2); </p>
<p>said of the Lord's advent; the "year of Jehovah's good pleasure" denotes the time of 
a new church. In the same: </p>
<p>     The day of vengeance is in My heart, and the year of My redeemed is come (Isa. 63:4); </p>
<p>this too is said of the Lord's advent; the "year of the redeemed" denotes the time 
of a new church. In the same: </p>
<p>     It is the day of vengeance to Jehovah; the year of retributions for the controversy of Zion (Isa. 34:8); </p>
<p>where the signification is similar. [3] The same time 
is also called the "year of visitation" in Jeremiah: </p>
<p>     I will bring evil upon the men of Anathoth, in the year of their visitation (Jer. 11:23). In the same: </p>
<p>     I will bring upon Moab the year 
of their visitation (Jer. 48:44). Still more plainly in Ezekiel: </p>
<p>     After many days thou shalt be visited; in the futurity of years thou shalt come into the land that is brought back from the sword, 
that is gathered out of many peoples, upon the mountains of Israel, which shall be for a waste continually (Ezek. 38:8); </p>
<p>"the futurity of years" denotes the last time of the church, which then becomes 
no church, those being rejected who before were of the church, and others received from elsewhere. In Isaiah: </p>
<p>     Thus hath the Lord said unto me, Yet within a year, according to the years of 
a hireling, and all the glory of Kedar shall be consumed (Isa. 21:16); </p>
<p>here also is meant the last time. [4] In Ezekiel: </p>
<p>     Thou art become guilty in thy blood that thou hast shed, and art defiled 
in thine idols which thou hast made; and thou hast caused thy days to draw near, and art come even unto thy years; therefore have I made thee a reproach unto the nations, and a mocking to all the lands 
(Ezek. 22:4); </p>
<p>"to come even unto the years" denotes to the end, when the Lord withdraws from the church. In Isaiah: </p>
<p>     Now hath Jehovah spoken, saying, "Within three years, as the years of a 
hireling, and the glory of Moab shall be brought into contempt, with all his great multitude, and the remnant shall be very small (Isa. 16:14); </p>
<p>"within three years" also denotes the end of the former 
church. That "three" denotes what is complete, and a beginning, may be seen above (n. 1825, 2788). [5] Similar is the signification of "seven," and also of "seventy" (n. 720, 728, 901); and therefore 
it is said in Isaiah: </p>
<p>     And it shall come to pass in that day that Tyre shall be forgotten seventy years, according to the days of one king; after the end of seventy years it shall be to Tyre as 
in the song of a harlot. And it shall come to pass after the end of seventy years that Jehovah will visit Tyre, and she shall return to her harlot hire (Isa. 23:15-17); </p>
<p>"seventy years" denotes the entire 
period, from the time at which the church began even till it expires; which is also meant by "the days of one king," for a "king" signifies the truth of the church (see n. 1672, 1728, 2015, 2069). 
The "seventy years" of captivity in which the Jews were, also involve something similar, of which likewise it is said in Jeremiah: </p>
<p>     These nations shall serve the king of Babel seventy years; and 
it shall come to pass when seventy years are fulfilled, I will visit their iniquity upon the king of Babel, and upon this nation, saith Jehovah (Jer. 25:11-12; 29:10). [6] That a "year," and also 
"years," denote the entire period of a church, or the time of its duration, may be seen still further in Malachi: </p>
<p>     Behold I send Mine angel, and he shall prepare the way before Me; and the Lord whom 
ye seek shall suddenly come to His temple, even the angel of the covenant whom ye desire; behold He cometh, said Jehovah Zebaoth; and who may endure the day of His coming? Then shall the offering 
of Judah and Jerusalem be pleasant unto Jehovah, according to the days of an age, and according to the ancient years (Mal. 3:1-2, 4); </p>
<p>where the advent of the Lord is treated of; the "days of an age" 
denote the Most Ancient Church; "ancient years," the Ancient Church; the "offering of Judah," worship from celestial love; and the "offering of Jerusalem," worship from spiritual love; that Judah is not 
meant here, nor Jerusalem, is plain. In David: </p>
<p>     I have considered the days of old, and the years of the ages (Ps. 77:5); </p>
<p>where the "days of old" and the "years of the ages" denote the same churches. 
This is still more plain in Moses: </p>
<p>     Remember the days of an age, understand the years of generation and generation; ask thy father, and he will show thee; thine elders, and they will tell 
thee. When the Most High gave to the nations their inheritance, when He separated the sons of man (Deut. 32:7-8). [7] That a "year" and "years" denote the full time of a church, is also plain in Habakkuk: </p>
<p> 
    O Jehovah, I have heard Thy fame, I was afraid; O Jehovah, revive Thy work in the midst of the years, in the midst of the years make known; in anger remember mercy. God will come from Teman, 
and the Holy One from Mount Paran (Hab. 3:2-3); </p>
<p>This is said of the Lord's advent; "in the midst of the years" denotes in the fullness of times; and what is meant by the fullness of times" may be 
seen just above (n. 2905). [8] As a "year" and "years" signify the full time between its two limits, which are the beginning and the end when predicated of the Lord's kingdom on earth (that is, the 
church) so they signify what is eternal when predicated of the Lord's kingdom in heaven. As in David: </p>
<p>     O God, Thy years are to generation and generation; and Thou art He, and Thy years shall not 
be brought to an end. The sons of Thy servants shall continue, and their seed shall be established before Thee (Ps. 102:24, 27-28). In the same: </p>
<p>     Thou wilt add days to the days of the king, his 
years shall be as generation and generation; he shall dwell before God forever (Ps. 61:6-7); </p>
<p>where "years" denote what is eternal, for this treats of the Lord and His kingdom.  [9] The lambs which were 
offered for burnt-offering and sacrifice being "sons of their year" (see Lev. 12:6; 14:10; Num. 6:12; 7:15, 21, 27, 33, 39, 45, 51, 57, 63, 69, 75, 81, and other places), signified the celestial things 
of innocence in the Lord's kingdom, which are eternal. And for this reason also the burnt-offering of calves that were "sons of a year" is mentioned as being most grateful (Micah 6:6). [10] That 
in the internal sense a "year" does not signify a year, is also evident from the fact that the angels, who are in the internal sense of the Word, cannot have an idea of any year; but because a year 
is a full period of time in nature, which belongs to the world, therefore instead of a year they have an idea of what is full in respect to states of the church, and of what is eternal in respect to states 
of heaven; times with them are states (see n. 1274, 1382, 2625, 2788, 2837). </p>

<p align="center"><b>Elliott(1983-1999) 2906</b></p><p><b>2906.</b>
'The years of the life of Sarah' means when any Divine truth still existed on earth. This is clear from the meaning of 'a year' as a whole period of the Church from start to finish, and so of 'years' 
as periods, dealt with immediately above in <a href="2905.htm">2905</a>; and from the meaning of 'the life of Sarah' as states as regards Divine truth, also dealt with just above, in <a href="2904.htm">2904</a>. Thus here the end when no Divine 
truth at all existed any longer is meant, as also follows from the words that occur immediately before these. </p>
<p></p>
<p><b>[2]</b>
 That 'a year' means the whole length of time a state of the Church lasts, from start 
to finish, or what amounts to the same, a whole period, and that consequently 'years' means the periods of time within the general whole, becomes clear from the following places in the Word: In Isaiah, </p>
<blockquote>
Jehovah 
has anointed Me to bring good tidings to the afflicted; He has sent Me to bind up the broken in heart, to proclaim liberty to captives, and opening of every kind to those that are bound, 
to proclaim the year of Jehovah's good pleasure, and the day of vengeance for our God. <a href="http://bible.gospelcom.net/cgi-bin/bible?passage=Isa%2061:1,%202&amp;version=ESV&amp;interface=print&amp;showfn=yes&amp;showxref">Isa 61:1, 2</a>. 
</blockquote>
<p>This refers to the Coming of the Lord. 'The year of Jehovah's good pleasure' stands for the time 
of the new Church. In the same prophet, </p>
<blockquote>
The day of vengeance was in My heart, and the year of My redeemed has come. <a href="http://bible.gospelcom.net/cgi-bin/bible?passage=Isa%2063:4&amp;version=ESV&amp;interface=print&amp;showfn=yes&amp;showxref">Isa 63:4</a>. 
</blockquote>
<p>This similarly refers to the Coming of the Lord. 'The year of the 
redeemed' stands for the time of the new Church. In the same prophet, </p>
<blockquote>
The day of Jehovah's vengeance, the year of retributions on account of the controversy of Zion. <a href="http://bible.gospelcom.net/cgi-bin/bible?passage=Isa%2034:8&amp;version=ESV&amp;interface=print&amp;showfn=yes&amp;showxref">Isa 34:8</a>. 
</blockquote>
<p>Here the meaning 
is similar. </p>
<p></p>
<p><b>[3]</b>
 That same period is also called 'the year of visitation': in Jeremiah,  </p>
<blockquote>
I will bring evil to the men of Anathoth in the year of their visitation. <a href="http://bible.gospelcom.net/cgi-bin/bible?passage=Jer%2011:23&amp;version=ESV&amp;interface=print&amp;showfn=yes&amp;showxref">Jer 11:23</a>.  
</blockquote>
<p>In the same prophet, </p>
<blockquote>
I 
will bring upon Moab the year of their visitation. <a href="http://bible.gospelcom.net/cgi-bin/bible?passage=Jer%2048:44&amp;version=ESV&amp;interface=print&amp;showfn=yes&amp;showxref">Jer 48:44</a>. 
</blockquote>
<p>And plainer still in Ezekiel, </p>
<blockquote>
After many days you will be visited; in the latter years you will come upon the land that 
is brought back from the sword, that is gathered out of many peoples, upon the mountains of Israel, which will be a waste continually. <a href="http://bible.gospelcom.net/cgi-bin/bible?passage=Ezek%2038:8&amp;version=ESV&amp;interface=print&amp;showfn=yes&amp;showxref">Ezek 38:8</a>. 
</blockquote>
<p>'The latter years' stands for the final period of 
the Church when it becomes that which is not the Church, those who previously belonged to the Church having been rejected and others having been accepted from other places. In Isaiah, </p>
<blockquote>
Thus said the 
Lord to me, Within yet a year, according to the years of a hireling, and all the glory of Kedar will be brought to an end. <a href="http://bible.gospelcom.net/cgi-bin/bible?passage=Isa%2021:16&amp;version=ESV&amp;interface=print&amp;showfn=yes&amp;showxref">Isa 21:16</a>. 
</blockquote>
<p>This too stands for the final period. </p>
<p></p>
<p><b>[4]</b>
 In Ezekiel, </p>
<blockquote>
You 
have become guilty by your blood which you have shed, and defiled by your idols which you have made, and you have brought your days near, and you have come even to your years. Therefore I have made 
you a reproach to the nations and a mocking to all the lands. <a href="http://bible.gospelcom.net/cgi-bin/bible?passage=Ezek%2022:4&amp;version=ESV&amp;interface=print&amp;showfn=yes&amp;showxref">Ezek 22:4</a>. 
</blockquote>
<p>'Coming even to their years' stands for coming to the end when the Lord departs from the Church. In Isaiah, </p>
<blockquote>
Jehovah has 
now spoken, saying, In three years, as with the years of a hireling, the glory of Moab will grow worthless, with all its great multitude; and the residue will be tiny and of no account. <a href="http://bible.gospelcom.net/cgi-bin/bible?passage=Isa%2016:14&amp;version=ESV&amp;interface=print&amp;showfn=yes&amp;showxref">Isa 16:14</a>. 
</blockquote>
<p>'In 
three years' also stands for the end of the previous Church - 'three' meaning that which has been completed and that which is a beginning, see <a href="1825.htm">1825</a>, <a href="2788.htm">2788</a>. </p>
<p></p>
<p><b>[5]</b>
 Seven, and also seventy, have the 
same meaning, see <a href="720.htm">720</a>, <a href="728.htm">728</a>, <a href="901.htm">901</a>. Consequently it is said in Isaiah, </p>
<blockquote>
And it will be on that day, that Tyre will pass into oblivion for seventy years, according to the days of one king. At the end 
of seventy years it will happen to Tyre according to the song of the harlot. And it will be at the end of seventy years, that Jehovah will visit Tyre, and she will return to hiring herself out as a harlot. 
<a href="http://bible.gospelcom.net/cgi-bin/bible?passage=Isa%2023:15,%2017&amp;version=ESV&amp;interface=print&amp;showfn=yes&amp;showxref">Isa 23:15, 17</a>. 
</blockquote>
<p>'Seventy years' stands for a whole period, from the time a Church comes into being until the time it breathes its last, which is also 'the days of one king', for 'a king' means 
a Church's truth, see <a href="1672.htm">1672</a>, <a href="1728.htm">1728</a>, <a href="2015.htm">2015</a>, <a href="2069.htm">2069</a>. The captivity which the Jews were sent into lasting seventy years entails something similar. That captivity is also spoken of in Jeremiah as follows, </p>
<blockquote>
These 
nations will serve the king of Babel seventy years, and it will be, when the seventy years are fulfilled, that I will visit the king of Babel and this nation for their iniquity, said Jehovah. 
<a href="http://bible.gospelcom.net/cgi-bin/bible?passage=Jer%2025:11,%2012;%2029:10&amp;version=ESV&amp;interface=print&amp;showfn=yes&amp;showxref">Jer 25:11, 12; 29:10</a>. 
</blockquote>
<p></p>
<p><b>[6]</b>
 That 'a year', and also 'years', is a whole period of the Church, or the time it lasts, becomes clearer still in Malachi, </p>
<blockquote>
Behold, I am sending My angel, and he will prepare 
the way before Me; and suddenly there will come to His temple the Lord whom you are seeking, and the angel of the covenant in whom you delight. Behold, He is coming, said Jehovah Zebaoth. And who 
can endure the day of His coming? Then the offering of Judah and Jerusalem will be pleasing to Jehovah, as in the days of old, and as in ancient years. <a href="http://bible.gospelcom.net/cgi-bin/bible?passage=Mal%203:1,%202,%204&amp;version=ESV&amp;interface=print&amp;showfn=yes&amp;showxref">Mal 3:1, 2, 4</a>. 
</blockquote>
<p>This refers to the Coming of 
the Lord. 'The days of old' stands for the Most Ancient Church, 'ancient years' for the Ancient Church, 'the offering of Judah' for worship springing from celestial love, and 'the offering of Jerusalem' 
for worship springing from spiritual love. Here it is quite evident that neither Judah nor Jerusalem was meant. In David, </p>
<blockquote>
I have considered the days of old, and the years of long ago. <a href="http://bible.gospelcom.net/cgi-bin/bible?passage=Ps%2077:5&amp;version=ESV&amp;interface=print&amp;showfn=yes&amp;showxref">Ps 77:5</a>. 
</blockquote>
<p>Here 
'the days of old' and 'the years of long ago' stand for the same two Churches, as is plainer still in Moses, </p>
<blockquote>
Recollect the days of old, understand the years of generation after generation; 
ask your father and he will show you, your elders and they will tell you, When the Most High gave to the nations an inheritance, and Himself separated the sons of man. <a href="http://bible.gospelcom.net/cgi-bin/bible?passage=Deut%2032:7,%208&amp;version=ESV&amp;interface=print&amp;showfn=yes&amp;showxref">Deut 32:7, 8</a>. 
</blockquote>
<p></p>
<p><b>[7]</b>
 That 'a 
year' or 'years' is a complete period of the Church is also evident in Habakkuk, </p>
<blockquote>
O Jehovah, I have heard Your fame; I was afraid. O Jehovah, revive Your work in the midst of the years, in the midst 
of the years make it known; in wrath You will remember mercy. God will come out of Teman, and the Holy One out of Mount Paran. <a href="http://bible.gospelcom.net/cgi-bin/bible?passage=Hab%203:2,%203&amp;version=ESV&amp;interface=print&amp;showfn=yes&amp;showxref">Hab 3:2, 3</a>. 
</blockquote>
<p>This refers to the Coming of the Lord. 'In the midst of 
the years' stands for in the fullness of time. For what the fullness of time is, see just above in <a href="2905.htm">2905</a>. </p>
<p></p>
<p><b>[8]</b>
 As 'a year' and 'years', when used in reference to the Lord's kingdom on earth, which is 
the Church, mean a complete period from start to finish, so when used in reference to the Lord's kingdom in heaven do they mean that which is eternal; as in David, </p>
<blockquote>
O God, Your years are from generation 
to generation. You are He, and Your years will have no end. The sons of Your servants will continue, and their seed will be established before You. <a href="http://bible.gospelcom.net/cgi-bin/bible?passage=Ps%20102:24,%2027,%2028&amp;version=ESV&amp;interface=print&amp;showfn=yes&amp;showxref">Ps 102:24, 27, 28</a>. 
</blockquote>
<p>In the same author, </p>
<blockquote>
You 
will add days to the king's days; His years as generation after generation! And He will dwell for ever before God. <a href="http://bible.gospelcom.net/cgi-bin/bible?passage=Ps%2061:6,%207&amp;version=ESV&amp;interface=print&amp;showfn=yes&amp;showxref">Ps 61:6, 7</a>. 
</blockquote>
<p>Here 'years' stands for that which is eternal since these words refer 
to the Lord and His kingdom. </p>
<p></p>
<p><b>[9]</b>
 The lambs offered in burnt offerings and sacrifices, which were to be in their first year, <a href="http://bible.gospelcom.net/cgi-bin/bible?passage=Lev%2012:6;%2014:10&amp;version=ESV&amp;interface=print&amp;showfn=yes&amp;showxref">Lev 12:6; 14:10</a>; <a href="http://bible.gospelcom.net/cgi-bin/bible?passage=Num%206:12;%207:15,%2021,%2033,%2039,%2045,%2051,%2057,%2063,%2069,%2075,%2081&amp;version=ESV&amp;interface=print&amp;showfn=yes&amp;showxref">Num 6:12; 7:15, 21, 33, 39, 45, 51, 57, 63, 69, 75, 81</a>; and elsewhere, meant the celestial things of innocence in the Lord's kingdom, which are eternal. Hence burnt offerings of calves in their first year are referred to in <a href="http://bible.gospelcom.net/cgi-bin/bible?passage=Micah%206:6&amp;version=ESV&amp;interface=print&amp;showfn=yes&amp;showxref">Micah 6:6</a> as being most acceptable. </p>

<p><b>[10]</b>
That 'a year' in the internal sense does not mean a year is made additionally clear from the consideration that angels, who possess the internal sense of the Word, are not able to possess 
the idea of any year. But because a year is a complete period of time within the natural world, they have instead of the idea of a year the idea of that which is completed in relation to states 
of the Church, and of that which is eternal in relation to states in heaven. To them periods of time are states, <a href="1274.htm">1274</a>, <a href="1382.htm">1382</a>, <a href="2625.htm">2625</a>, <a href="2788.htm">2788</a>, <a href="2837.htm">2837</a>. </p>

`Anni vitarum Sarae':  quod significet cum aliquid verum Divinum in terra superesset, constat ex significatione `anni' quod sit integra periodus quae Ecclesiae a principio ad finem, ita `annorum' quod 
sint periodi, de quibus mox supra n. 2905; et a significatione `vitarum Sarae' quod sint status quoad verum Divinum, de qua etiam mox supra n. 2904, ita hic quod terminus cum non amplius aliquid verum 
Divinum superesset; quod etiam a mox praecedentibus sequitur.  [2] Quod `annus' significet integrum tempus status Ecclesiae a principio ad finem, seu quod idem, integram periodum, et consequenter 
`anni' tempora seu periodos intra {1}communem, constare potest ab his locis in Verbo: apud Esaiam,           Unxit Jehovah Me ad evangelizandum afflictis, misit Me      ad obligandum fractos corde, 
ad proclamandum captivis      libertatem, et vinctis apertionem {2}omnimodam, ad      proclamandum annum beneplaciti Jehovae, et diem ultionis Deo      nostro, lxi 2; </p>
<p>ubi de Adventu Domini; `annus 
beneplaciti Jehovae' pro tempore novae' Ecclesiae:  apud eundem,           Dies ultionis in corde Meo, et annus redemptorum Meorum      venit,lxiii 4; </p>
<p>similiter de Adventu Domini; `annus redemptorum' 
pro tempore novae Ecclesiae:  apud eundem,           Dies ultionis Jehovae, annus retributionum propter litem Zionis, xxxiv 8; </p>
<p>similiter.  [3] Idem tempus etiam vocatur `annus visitationis,' apud 
Jeremiam,           Adducam malum ad viros Anathoth anno visitationis       illorum, xi 23: </p>
<p>apud eundem,           Adducam super Moabum annum visitationis eorum, xlviii       44: </p>
<p>manifestius 
apud Ezechielem,           A diebus multis visitaberis, in posteritate annorum       venies super terram reversam a gladio, congregatam e populis      multis, super montes Israelis, qui erunt ad vastitatem  
    jugiter, xxxviii 8; </p>
<p>`posteritas annorum' pro ultimo tempore Ecclesiae quae tunc nulla fit, rejectis illis qui prius ab Ecclesia fuerunt, et receptis aliunde aliis:  apud Esaiam,      
     Ita dixit Dominus ad me, In adhuc anno, secundum annos      mercenarii, et consumetur omnis gloria Kedaris, xxi 16; </p>
<p>ibi etiam pro ultimo tempore:  [4] apud Ezechielem,            In sanguine tuo 
quem effudisti, rea facta es, et in       idolis tuis quae fecisti, polluta es, et appropinquare fecisti      dies tuos, et venisti usque ad annos tuos, propterea dedi te      opprobrium gentibus, 
et ludibrium omnibus terris, xxii 4; </p>
<p>`venire usque ad annos' pro ad finem quando recedit Dominus ab Ecclesia:  apud Esaiam,           Nunc locutus est Jehovah, dicendo, In tribus annis,       sicut 
anni mercenarii, et evilescet gloria Moabi in omni      multitudine magna, et residuum parum pusillum, xvi 14; </p>
<p>`in tribus annis' etiam pro fine Ecclesiae prioris, quod `tres' sint {3}completum et 
principium, videatur n. 1825, 2788; [5] simile etiam significant `septem,' tum `septuaginta,' n. 720, 728, 901; inde apud Esaiam,           Et erit in die illo, et oblivioni tradetur Tyrus      septuaginta 
annis, secundum dies regis unius:  a fine      septuaginta annorum erit Tyro secundum canticum meretricis....      Et erit a fine septuaginta annorum, et visitabit Jehovah      Tyrum, et 
redibit ad mercedem meretriciam, xxiii 15, 17; </p>
<p>`septuaginta anni' pro integra periodo, a qua Ecclesia exstitit usque dum exspirat, quae etiam sunt `dies unius regis'; `rex' enim significat verum Ecclesiae, 
videatur n. 1672, 1728, 2015, 2069.  `Septuaginta annorum captivitas' in qua Judaei, simile quoddam etiam involvit, de qua quoque haec apud Jeremiam,           Servient gentes hae regi Babelis 
septuaginta annis, et      erit cum impleti septuaginta anni, visitabo super regem      Babelis, et super gentem hanc, dictum Jehovae, iniquitatem      eorum, xxv 11, 12; xxix 10. [6]  Quod `annus' 
tum etiam anni, sint integra periodus Ecclesiae, seu tempus ejus durationis, constare adhuc potest, apud Malachiam,           Ecce mittens angelum Meum, et parabit viam coram {4}Me,           et 
subito veniet ad templum Suum Dominus, Quem vos           quaerentes, et angelus foederis quem vos desideratis,           ecce venit, dixit Jehovah Zebaoth, et quis sustinet           diem Adventus 
Ipsius? ... tunc dulce erit Jehovae munus           Jehudae et Hierosolymae, secundum dies saeculi, et           secundum annos antiquos, iii 1, 2, 4; </p>
<p>ubi de Adventu Domini; `dies saeculi' pro Antiquissima 
Ecclesia, `anni antiqui' pro Antiqua Ecclesia, `munus Jehudae' pro cultu ex amore caelesti, et `munus Hierosolymae' pro cultu ex amore spirituali; quod hic non Jehudah intellectus, nec Hierosolyma, 
manifeste patet:  apud Davidem,           Cogitavi dies ab antiquo, et annos saeculorum, Ps. lxxvii      6 [A.V. 5]; </p>
<p>ubi `dies ab antiquo, et anni saeculorum' pro iisdem Ecclesiis: adhuc manifestius 
apud Mosen,           Recordare dierum saeculi, intelligite annos      generationis et generationis; interroga patrem tuum et      indicabit tibi, senes tuos et dicent tibi:  cum hereditatem  
    daret Altissimus gentibus, et separaret Ipse filios hominis,      Deut. xxxii 7, 8. [7] Quod `annus' et `anni' sit plenum tempus Ecclesiae, etiam patet apud Habakkuk,           Jehovah, audivi 
famam Tuam, timui Jehovah opus Tuum, in      medio annorum vivifica illud, in medio annorum notum facias; </p>
<p>     in ira misericordiae recorderis:  Deus e Temane veniet, et      Sanctus e monte 
Paran, iii 2, 3; </p>
<p>de Adventu Domini; `in medio annorum' pro in plenitudine temporum; quid plenitudo temporum, videatur mox supra n. 2905. [8] Sicut annus et anni significant plenum tempus inter utrumque 
suum terminum, principium et finem cum praedicantur de regno Domini in terra, hoc est, Ecclesia, ita significant aeternum cum praedicantur de regno Domini in caelo; ut apud Davidem,           Deus, 
in generationem et generationem anni Tui,...et Tu      Ipse, et anni Tui non consumentur; filii servorum Tuorum      residebunt, et semen illorum coram Te firmabitur, Ps. cii 25,      28, [29] [A.V. 
24, 27, 28]: </p>
<p>apud eundem,           Dies super dies regis addes, annos Ipsius secundum       generationem et generationem; et habitabit aeternum coram Deo,      Ps. lxi 7, 8 [A.V. 6, 7]; </p>
<p>ubi 
`anni' pro aeterno, agitur enim de Domino, et de regno Ipsius.  [9] Quod agni qui offerebantur in holocaustum et sacrificium, essent filii anni sui, Lev. xii 6; xiv 10; Num. vi 12; vii 15, 21, 27, 33, 
39, 45, 51, 57, 63, 69, 75, 81, et alibi, significabant caelestia innocentiae in regno Domini, quae aeterna; inde etiam holocaustum ex vitulis filiis anni, ut gratissimum, memoratur apud Micham vi 6. 
 [10] Quod `annus' in sensu interno non significet annum, etiam constare potest inde quod angeli qui in sensu interno Verbi sunt, non habere possint ideam alicujus anni, sed quia annus est temporis plenum 
in natura quae mundi, ideo loco anni ideam habent pleni respective ad status Ecclesiae, ac aeterni respective ad status caeli; tempora illis sunt status, n. 1274, 1382, 2625, 2788, 2837. @1 universalem$ @2 
Elsewhere S has oculis capto, compare Septuagint and Luke iv 18.$ @3 completum seu finis, ut et principium novum$ @4 Ipso AI but 3142, 3654 etc. have Me as Heb.$ </p>
