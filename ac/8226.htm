<h3 align="center" class="ired">属天的奥秘 第8226节</h3>
<h4 align="center"></h4><p><strong>8226.</strong>“到了天一亮，海水回到原流的分量”表由于主的同在，邪恶所生的虚假流回到他们身上。这从“回到”、“海”、“天一亮”和“原流的分量”的含义清楚可知：当论及“红海的水”所表示的邪恶所生的虚假时，“回到”是指流回或返回到他们身上，如刚才所述（<a href="8223.htm">8223</a>节）；“海”，此处即海水，是指存在于地狱中的邪恶所生的虚假（<a href="6346.htm">6346</a>，<a href="7307.htm">7307</a>，<a href="8137.htm">8137</a>节）；“天一亮”是指主的同在，如下文所述；“原流的分量”是指照着存在于地狱中的正常状态和秩序。因为和天堂一样，地狱也有秩序；在地狱，灵人照着不同种类的邪恶而彼此联系在一起生活，就像天使照着不同形式的良善而彼此联系一起一样；只是地狱里的联系就像强盗间的联系。“天一亮”表示主的同在，这一点从前面（<a href="8211.htm">8211</a>节）关于早晨的说明可以看出来，即：“早晨”对恶人来说，是一种黑暗和毁灭的状态，对善人来说是一种启示和得救的状态，这些状态仅仅由主的同在（<a href="7989.htm">7989</a>，<a href="8137.htm">8137</a>，<a href="8138.htm">8138</a>，<a href="8188.htm">8188</a>节），也就是其神性人身的同在（<a href="8159.htm">8159</a>节）带来的<br />与此处论及“埃及人”的话相类似的话也论及耶利米书中的“巴比伦”：<br />祂是形成万有的，尤其是祂产业的支派，万军之耶和华是祂的名。你是我的棒槌和战器；我要用你打散列族，用你毁灭列国，用你打散马和骑马的，用你打散战车和坐在其上的。我必在你们眼前报复巴比伦人和迦勒底所有居民在锡安所行的诸恶。（耶利米书<a href="http://39-27.cn/耶51.19.htm">51:19</a>-<a href="http://39-27.cn/耶51.21.htm">21</a>，<a href="http://39-27.cn/耶51.24.htm">24</a>）<br />此处“巴比伦”表示那些属于教会，亵渎良善的人；“迦勒底”表示那些亵渎真理的人；“马”、“战车”和“坐在其上的”也表示其理解力部分和随之而来的教义事物，以及推理；它们被“打散”表示荒凉。神性人身方面的主，他们因其同在而被打散，由这些话来表示：“祂是形成万有的，尤其是祂产业的支派，万军之耶和华是祂的名。你是我的棒槌和战器；我要用你打散列族，用你毁灭列国”；“列族”表示邪恶，“列国”表示虚假。由此也明显可知，他们对别人所行的邪恶会流回或返回到他们自己身上；因为经上说，他们的邪恶必报复在他们身上，在圣言的各处还说，到降罚或追讨的日子，要报仇，必有报复。</p>

And the sea returned, at the turn of the morning, to the strength of its flow. That this signifies the flowing back to them of the falsities from evil by reason of the presence of the Lord, is evident 
from the signification of "returning," when said of the falsities from evil which are signified by the "waters of the sea Suph," as being a flowing back or return to them (of which just above, n. 8223); 
from the signification of "the sea," here of the waters of the sea, as being falsities from evil which are in hell (n. 6346, 7307, 8137); from the signification of "the turn of the morning," as being 
the presence of the Lord (of which in what follows); and from the signification of "to the strength of its flow," as being according to the general state and order in hell; for in the hells there 
is order equally as in the heavens, because in the hells there is consociation by means of evils, as in the heavens by means of goods, but the consociation in the hells is like that of robbers. That 
"at the turn of the morning" denotes the presence of the Lord, can be seen from what was shown above concerning the morning (in n. 8211), namely, that "the morning" denotes a state of thick darkness and 
destruction to the evil, and a state of enlightenment and salvation to the good, and this from the mere presence of the Lord (n. 7989, 8137, 8138, 8188), that is, from the presence of His Divine Human 
(n. 8159).  [2] The like to what is here said of "the Egyptians" is said of "Babel" in Jeremiah: </p>
<p>     He is the Former of all things, chiefly of the rod of His inheritance, Jehovah Zebaoth is His 
name. Thou art my hammer, weapons of war; and by Thee will I scatter the nations; and by Thee will I destroy kingdoms; and by Thee will I scatter the horse and his rider; and by Thee will I scatter 
the chariot and him that is borne therein; and I will recompense to Babel and to all the inhabitants of Chaldea all their evil that they have done in Zion before your eyes (Jer. 51:19-21, 24);  by "Babel" 
here are signified those who have been of the church and have profaned good; and by "Chaldea," those who have profaned truth; their intellectual part and the derivative doctrinal things and reasonings 
are here also signified by "horse," "chariot," and "him that is borne therein;" and vastation, by their "being scattered." The Lord as to the Divine Human, by virtue of whose presence their scattering 
is effected, is meant by these words: "He is the Former of all things, chiefly of the rod of His inheritance, Jehovah Zebaoth is His name; Thou art my hammer and weapons of war; and by Thee will 
I scatter the nations; and by Thee will I destroy kingdoms;" "nations" denote evils, and "kingdoms" falsities. From all this also it is evident that the evils which they do to others flow back or return 
upon themselves, for it is said that "their evil shall be recompensed to them;" and also in various places in the Word it is said that in the day of visitation vengeance shall be taken, and that 
there shall be an avenging. </p>

<p align="center"><b>Elliott(1983-1999) 8226</b></p><p><b>8226.</b>
'And the sea returned, as morning was breaking, to its normal strength' means that the falsities arising from evil flowed back onto them, at the presence of the Lord. This is clear from the meaning of 
'returning' - when said of the falsities arising from evil, which are meant by 'the waters of the Sea Suph' - as flowing back or recoiling on them, dealt with just above in <a href="8223.htm">8223</a>; from the meaning of 
'the sea', at this point the waters of the sea, as the falsities arising from evil that exist in hell, dealt with in <a href="6346.htm">6346</a>, <a href="7307.htm">7307</a>, <a href="8137.htm">8137</a>; from the meaning of 'as morning was breaking' as the Lord's presence, 
dealt with below; and from the meaning of 'to its normal strength' as in accordance with the normal state and order existing in hell. For order exists in the hells no less than in the heavens; in 
the hells spirits live in association with one another according to different types of evil, just as angels do so according to different forms of good. But in the hells an association is like that of 
a band of robbers. The meaning of 'as morning was breaking' as the presence of the Lord may be seen from what has been shown above in <a href="8211.htm">8211</a> regarding 'morning', which is that 'morning' is a state of 
thick darkness and perdition for the evil and a state of enlightenment and salvation for the good, states brought about simply by the presence of the Lord, <a href="7989.htm">7989</a>, <a href="8137.htm">8137</a>, <a href="8138.htm">8138</a>, <a href="8188.htm">8188</a> - by the presence of 
His Divine Human, <a href="8159.htm">8159</a>. </p>
<p></p>
<p><b>[2]</b>
 <a href="2.htm">2</a> Something similar to what is stated here in reference to the Egyptians is said of Babel in Jeremiah, </p>
<blockquote>
He is the One who formed all things, especially the rod of His 
inheritance; Jehovah Zebaoth is His name. You are to me a hammer, weapons of war, and through You I will scatter the nations, and through You I will destroy the kingdoms, and through You I will scatter 
the horse and its chariot, and through you I will scatter the chariot and him who rides in it. I will repay Babel and all the inhabitants of Chaldea for all their evil which they have done in Zion before 
your eyes. <a href="http://bible.gospelcom.net/cgi-bin/bible?passage=Jer%2051:19-21,%2024&amp;version=ESV&amp;interface=print&amp;showfn=yes&amp;showxref">Jer 51:19-21, 24</a>. 
</blockquote>
<p>'Babel' here means those who belonged to the Church and rendered good profane, and 'Chaldea' those who belonged to the Church and rendered truth so. Their understanding 
of things, and consequently their doctrinal teachings and reasonings, are meant in these verses also by 'horse, chariot, and him who rides in it', and being laid waste by their being 'scattered'. 
The Lord in respect of His Divine Human, at whose presence they are scattered, is meant by the words 'He is the One who formed all things, especially the rod of His inheritance; Jehovah Zebaoth is 
His name. You are to me a hammer, weapons of war; through You I will scatter the nations, and through You I will destroy the kingdoms', 'the nations' meaning evils and 'the kingdoms' falsities. From 
all this too it is evident that the evils which they do to others flow back or recoil on themselves; for it says that they will be repaid their evil, and also in various other places that on the day of 
visitation vengeance will be taken and retribution exacted. </p>

`Et reversum est mare ad vergere mane, ad vim fluxus sui': quod significet redundationem falsorum ex malo ad illos, ex praesentia Domini, constat ex significatione `reverti' cum de falsis ex malo dicitur, 
quae significantur per `aquas maris Suph,' quod sit redundatio seu relapsus ad illos, de qua mox supra n. 8223; ex significatione `maris,' hic aquarum maris, quod sint falsa ex {1}malo quae in 
{2} (x)inferno, de qua n. 6346, (x)7307, 8137; (s)ex significatione `vergere ad mane' quod sit praesentia Domini, de qua sequitur; et ex significatione `ad vim fluxus sui' quod sit secundum statum communem 
et ordinem in inferno, nam in infernis est ordo aeque ac in caelis, in infernis enim est consociatio per mala, sicut in caelis per bona, sed consociatio in infernis est qualis est latronum.  Quod 
`vergere ad mane' sit praesentia Domini, constare potest ex illis quae supra de mane n. 8211 ostensa sunt, quod nempe `mane' sit status caliginis et interitus malis, et status illustrationis et salvationis 
bonis, et hoc ex sola praesentia Domina, n. 7989, 8137, 8138, 8188; quodque ex praesentia Divini Humani Ipsius, n. 8159. 	2 Simile quod hic de Aegyptiis, de Babele dicitur apud Jeremiam, Formator 
omnium Ille, imprimis baculi hereditatis Ipsius; Jehovah Zebaoth nomen Ipsius; malleus Tu mihi, arma belli, et dispergam per Te gentes, et perdam per Te regna, et dispergam per Te equum, et {3}currum 
illius, et dispergam per Te currum et {4}(x)vectum in eo: retribuam Babeli et omnibus habitatoribus Chaldaeae, omne malum illorum quod fecerunt in Zione coram oculis vestris, li 19-21, 24; </p>
<p>per 
`Babelem' ibi significantur qui ab Ecclesia fuerunt ac bonum profanarunt, et per `Chaldaeam' {5} qui verum; intellectuale illorum, (c)ac inde doctrinalia (c)et ratiocinia, significantur hic quoque per 
`equum, currum, et vectum in illo'; ac vastatio per `dispersionem illorum'; Dominus quoad Divinum Humanum, ex Cujus praesentia {6}dispersio illorum, {7} intelligitur per haec verba, `Formator omnium 
Ille, imprimis baculi hereditatis Ipsius, Jehovah Zebaoth nomen Ipsius, malleus Tu mihi, arma belli, dispergam per Te gentes, et perdam per Te regna'; `gentes' sunt mala, et `regna' falsa.  Ex his quoque 
patet quod mala quae faciunt aliis redundent seu relabantur super ipsos; dicitur enim quod `retribuetur illis malum'; {8}et quoque alibi passim quod in die visitationis sumetur ultio ac vindicabitur.(s) 	@1
