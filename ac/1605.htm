<h3 align="center" class="ired">属天的奥秘 第1605节</h3>
<h4 align="center"></h4><p><strong>1605.</strong>“向北南东西”表所有人，和整个宇宙中的人一样多。这从四个方位的含义清楚可知。在圣言中，“北方”、“南方”、“东方”、“西方”都有各自的含义。“北方”表教会之外的人，也就是说，那些在信之真理方面处在黑暗当中的人；它还表人里面的黑暗。而“南方”表教会之内的人，也就是说，那些在认知方面处在光明之中的人；它还表光明本身。“东方”表那些以前活着的人；它还表属天之爱，如前所述。而“西方”表那些将要活着的人；它还表那些没有爱的人。它们的具体含义可从内义的连贯性看出来。不过，当北、南、东、西一起提及时，如此处的情形，它们则表示现在活着的全世界所有人，还表示那些以前活着的人和那些将要活着的人；它们还表示人类在爱与信方面的状态。</p><br />

<p><strong>[NCE]1605.</strong> The symbolism of toward the north and toward the south and toward the east and toward the west as absolutely everyone in the universe can be seen from the meaning of these directions. North, south, east, and west each symbolize something of their own in the Word. The north symbolizes people outside the church, that is, people who are in the dark as far as truths of the faith go; it also symbolizes the darkness inside a person. The south, on the other hand, symbolizes people in the church, that is, people who are in the light as far as religious knowledge goes; likewise it symbolizes the light itself. The east symbolizes people who have gone before, and heavenly love too, as shown before.{*1} The west, on the other hand, symbolizes people yet to come, and likewise people lacking love. What each symbolizes can be seen from the running thread of the inner meaning.<br />When all the directions are mentioned, however, as north, south, east, and west are here, they symbolize everyone now alive in the whole inhabited world, and in addition those who have gone before and those yet to come. They also symbolize different states of love and faith in the human race.<br /><br /><strong>Footnotes:</strong><br />{*1} See 搂搂<a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_1605/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_101" target=_top>101</a>, <a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_1605/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_1250" target=_top>1250</a>, <a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_1605/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_1451" target=_top>1451</a>, <a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_1605/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_1593" target=_top>1593</a>. These passages describe the east as symbolizing the Lord and love. They do not specifically treat it as symbolizing the people of ancient times, but Swedenborg often describes the very earliest people as embodying love in a way that no succeeding generation has done; see, for instance, 搂搂<a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_1605/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_200" target=_top>200-202</a>, <a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_1605/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_310" target=_top>310</a>, <a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_1605/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_398" target=_top>398</a>, <a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_1605/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_1121" target=_top>1121</a>.

Northward, and southward, and eastward, and westward. That this signifies all men, as many as there are in the universe, is evident from the signification of these quarters. In the Word, the "north," 
"south," "east," and "west," has each its own signification. The "north" signifies those who are out of the church, namely, those who are in darkness as regards the truths of faith; and it also signifies 
the darkness in man. But the "south" signifies those who are within the church, that is, who are in the light as regards knowledges; and it likewise signifies the light itself. The "east" signifies 
those who lived previously; and it also signifies celestial love, as before shown. But the "west" signifies those who are to come, and in like manner those who are not in love. The special signification 
of these words is seen from the connection in the internal sense. But when they are all mentioned, as here, "the north, south, east, and west," they signify all in the whole world who are now living, 
and also those who have been, and those who are to come; they also signify the states of the human race in regard to love and faith. </p>

<p align="center"><b>Elliott(1983-1999) 1605</b></p><p><b>1605.</b>
'Towards the north, and towards the south, and towards the east, and towards the west' means all men, as many as there are in the entire universe. This is clear from the meaning of these four directions. 
In the Word north, south, east, and west each have their own particular meaning. 'North' means people who are outside the Church, that is to say, who are in darkness as regard truths of faith; and 
it also means the darkness residing with the individual. 'South' however means people who are inside the Church, that is to say, who are in light as regards cognitions; and likewise it means the light 
itself. 'East' means people who lived in the past; and it also means celestial love, as shown already. 'West' however means people who will live in the future, and likewise people who do not have love. 
What they mean is clear from the train of thought in the internal sense. But when north, south, east, and west are all mentioned together, as they are here, they mean everybody living throughout 
the whole world, as well as those who lived in the past and those who will do so in the future. They also mean the states of the human race as regards love and faith. </p>

<p align="center"><b>Latin(1748-1756) 1605</b>
</p><b>1605.</b>
'Versus septentrionem, et versus meridiem, et versus orientem, et versus occidentem': quod significet omnes quotcumque sunt in universo, constat a significatione horum; septentrio, meridies, oriens 
et occidens in Verbo significant unumquodvis per se aliquid; 'septentrio' illos qui sunt extra Ecclesiam qui nempe in tenebris quoad veritates fidei sunt, tum quoque significat tenebras apud hominem: 
'meridies' autem significat illos qui intra Ecclesiam sunt qui nempe in luce quoad cognitiones sunt, similiter etiam ipsam lucem: 'oriens' significat illos qui antea fuerunt, tum quoque amorem caelestem, 
ut prius ostensum: 'occidens' autem significat illos qui venturi, similiter qui non in amore: quid significent, ex serie in sensu interno constat: cum autem omnes dicuntur, ut hic, septentrio, meridies, 
oriens et occidens, significant omnes qui in universo terrarum orbe qui vivunt, tam quoque qui fuerunt, et qui venturi; significant etiam status humani generis quoad amorem et fidem. </p>
