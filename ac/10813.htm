<h3 align="center" class="ired">属天的奥秘 第10813节</h3>
<h4 align="center"></h4><p><strong>10813</strong>.除此之外，这个星球的灵人还说，他们的访客，就是前面所说的修道士灵人，还极其渴望他们住在一个社群里，而不是分开单独居住。事实上，灵人和天使如在世时那样居住并生活在一起，因为每个人在世上的生活都随着他进入来世。那些在世时群居的人在来世仍旧群居，那些分成各家各户居住的人仍旧分开居住。这些灵人生活在自己星球上时，就是各家各户各宗族分开居住的。所以，他们不知道什么叫住在一个社群里。因此，当他们被告知，这些访客想让他们这样做，是为了可以命令或统治他们，否则就无法让他们服从他们自己，把他们沦为奴隶了时，他们回答说，他们根本不知道什么叫命令和统治。一想到命令和统治，他们就会逃跑，我从以下事实发现这一点：当我向一路陪同我们回来的他们当中的一个灵人展示我所居住的城市时，他一看见就跑得远远的，再也没有出现过。要知道，当主乐意时，灵人 天使就能透过一个人的眼睛看见世上的事物。但主只允许这种情况发生在祂允许与灵人和天使交谈，并与他们在一起的人身上。祂允许他们透过我的眼睛看见世上的事物，就像我自己看它们那样清楚，还允许他们听见人们与我交谈。</p>

Among other things, the spirits of that earth also said that those visitors who as has been said were monkish spirits, were extremely desirous that they should live together in a society, and not separated 
and solitary. For spirits and angels dwell and live together in a like manner as in the world, because everyone's life in the world follows him. Those who in the world have dwelt congregated together, 
so dwell there; and those who have dwelt separated into houses and families dwell there in the same way. When these spirits lived on their earth, they dwelt separate, household by household, family 
by family, and thus nation by nation; and consequently they did not know what it is to dwell together in a society; so that when they were told that the reason why those visitors desired this was 
in order that they might command or have dominion over them, and that otherwise they could not subject them to themselves and make them slaves, they replied that they did not at all know what it is 
to command and have dominion. That they flee at the mere idea of command or rule, I observed from the fact that when I showed the city in which I dwelt to one of them who accompanied us back, at the first 
view of it he fled away and was seen no more. Be it known that when it pleases the Lord, spirits and angels can see through a man's eyes the things which are in the world; but the Lord allows this 
solely with one to whom He grants to speak with spirits and angels, and to be with them. It was granted them to see through my eyes the things which are in the world as plainly as I myself see them, 
and also to hear men speaking with me. </p>

The spirits belonging to that planet also said among other things that those newcomers - who, as stated, were monastic spirits - had a very eager desire that they should live together in society and 
not separately, in individual units. For spirits and angels reside in places and dwell together just as they did in the world, since everyone's life as it was in this world follows him into the next. 
Those who dwelt congregated together when in the world dwell congregated together in the next life, and those who dwelt separated into households and families dwell separated in the same way. When these 
spirits lived on their planet they dwelt separately, one household separate from another, one family from another, and so one clan from another. Consequently they had no idea of what dwelling together 
in society might be. When therefore they were told that the newcomers wanted them to do so, to the end that they might rule or have dominion over them, and that there was no other way in which the 
newcomers could make them subject to themselves and turn them into slaves, they replied that they were totally unaware of what it was to rule or have dominion. The very thought of rule or dominion makes 
them run away, as I came to realize from the fact that when I showed the city I dwelt in to one of them, who was accompanying us on the way back, he ran far away at the very sight of it and was not 
seen again. It should be recognized that, when the Lord pleases, spirits and angels can see things in the world through the eyes of a person there. But the Lord does not permit this to happen with anyone 
other than a person whom He allows to talk to spirits and angels and mix with them. Through my eyes He has allowed them to see things existing in the world, and as plainly as I see them, and also 
to hear the people talking to me.  </p>

Inter alia quoque dicebant spiritus illius telluris quod advenae illi qui, ut dictum est, erant spiritus monachi, omni studio vellent ut in societate simul viverent, (c)et non separati et solitarii; 
spiritus enim (c)et angeli habitant et cohabitant {1}similiter ut in mundo, nam (x)unumquemvis sequitur vita {2}ejus in mundo; qui congregati {3}habitarunt in mundo, etiam congregati ibi habitant et 
qui separati in domos et familias, etiam separati similiter {4} habitant; hi spiritus in tellure sua, cum ibi vixerunt, habitaverunt separati, domus et domus, familiae et familiae, et sic gentes et gentes, 
et inde nesciverunt quid esset habitare in societate simul; quare cum dicebatur illis quod advenae illi ita vellent, ob causam ut imperarent seu dominarentur super illos, et quod non aliter (x)possent 
subjicere illos sibi, et facere illos servos, respondebant quod prorsus nesciant quid sit imperare {5}et dominari; quod fugiant ad solam ideam imperii seu dominatus, animadvertebam ex eo quod unus 
ex illis qui nos comitabatur retro, cum ostenderem illi urbem in qua habitabam, ad primum aspectum ejus aufugeret, et amplius non visus.  Sciendum est quod spiritus et angeli, quando Domino beneplacet, 
possint videre illa quae in mundo per oculos hominis, sed hoc non concedit Dominus apud alium quam cui dat loqui cum spiritibus et angelis et esse cum illis; per meos oculos datum est illis videre 
illa quae in mundo, et tam manifeste, sicut ego; tum etiam audire homines mecum loquentes. @1 prorsus sicut$ @2 secundum ejus vitam$ @3 habitant$ @4 i ibi$ @5 seu$ </p>
