<h3 align="center" class="ired">属天的奥秘 第9570节</h3>
<h4 align="center"></h4><p><strong>9570.</strong>“它要使灯盏向上”表属灵天堂的光。这从“使灯盏向上”的含义清楚可知。“使灯盏向上”是指点燃他们里面的光，好叫他们发光；由于灯台代表属灵天堂（参看<a href="9548.htm">9548</a>节），所以“使灯盏向上”表示属灵天堂的光。属灵天堂的光是指从主发出的神性真理，和源于它的信、对真理的聪明理解、对良善的智慧洞察（参看<a href="9548.htm">9548</a>节所提到的地方）。必须简要说明属灵天堂的光是怎么回事。在主的属天国度，就是至内层或第三层天堂有一种光远远超越属灵国度，就是中间或第二层天堂中的光。属天国度或至内层天堂的光并不显为光，而是显为火焰。原因在于，在该天堂掌权的，是爱之良善；在天堂，爱之良善从视觉上显为火焰。但在主的属灵国度，就是中间或第二层天堂则有一种光远远超越世界之光；然而，它显得亮白。原因在于，在该天堂掌权的是源于爱之良善的信之真理；在天堂，源于该良善的信之真理从视觉上显为明亮的白光。这也解释了为何在圣言中，“光”表示源于良善的真理，在至高意义上表示从主的神性良善发出的神性真理。由此可见何谓“属灵天堂的光”，何谓发出这光的“灯的火焰”。</p>

And it shall make its lamps go up. That this signifies the light of the spiritual heaven, is evident from the signification of "making its lamps go up," as being to kindle a light in them, that they 
may give light; and as the spiritual heaven was represented by the lampstand (see n. 9548), therefore by "making the lamps go up" is signified the light of the spiritual heaven. The light of the spiritual 
heaven is the Divine truth that proceeds from the Lord, and the consequent faith, intelligence of truth, and wisdom of good (see what was cited in n. 9548). How the case is with the light of the 
spiritual heaven shall be briefly stated. In the Lord's celestial kingdom, which is the inmost or third heaven, there is a light which immeasurably surpasses the light in the spiritual kingdom, which 
is the middle or second heaven. The light of the celestial kingdom, that is, of the inmost heaven, does not appear as light, but as flame; the reason being that the good of love reigns in this heaven, 
and in heaven the good of love is presented to view as flame. But in the Lord's spiritual kingdom, which is the middle or second heaven, there is a light which immeasurably surpasses the light of the 
world, and yet it appears bright white, for the reason that in this heaven there reigns the truth of faith from the good of charity; and in heaven the truth of faith from this good is presented to view 
as a bright white light. From this in the Word also "light" signifies the truth which is from good, and in the supreme sense the Divine truth that proceeds from the Lord's Divine good. From all this 
it can now be seen what is meant by "the light of the spiritual heaven," and what by "the flame of the lamp," from which is this light. </p>

'And let it cause its lamps to go up' means the light of the spiritual heaven. This is clear from the meaning of 'causing the lamps to go up' as kindling a light in them so that they may give light; 
and since 'the lampstand' represented the spiritual heaven, <a href="9548.htm">9548</a>, 'causing the lamps to go up' means the light of the spiritual heaven. The light of the spiritual heaven is Divine Truth emanating from 
the Lord, and the faith, intelligent understanding of truth, and wise discernment of good that spring from it, see the places referred to in <a href="9548.htm">9548</a>. What the light of the spiritual heaven is like must 
be stated briefly. In the Lord's celestial kingdom, which is the inmost or third heaven, there is light which is vastly superior to the light that exists in the Lord's spiritual kingdom, which is the 
middle or second heaven. The light of the celestial kingdom or inmost heaven does not have the appearance of light but of flame. The reason for this is that in that heaven the good of love reigns, and 
the good of love manifests itself visually in heaven as flame, whereas in the Lord's spiritual kingdom, which is the middle or second heaven, there is light which, though vastly superior to the light 
of the world, nevertheless has the appearance of brilliant light. And the reason why is that in this heaven the truth of faith springing from the good of love reigns, and the truth of faith springing 
from that good manifests itself visually in heaven as brilliant light. This also explains why 'light' in the Word means truth that springs from good, and in the highest sense Divine Truth emanating from 
the Lord's Divine Good. From all this it may now become clear what should be understood by the light of the spiritual heaven, and what by the flame of the lamp from which that light shines.  </p>

`Et ascendere faciat lucernas ejus': quod significet lucem caeli spiritualis, constat ex significatione `ascendere facere lucernas' quod sit accendere ibi lucem ut illuminent; et quia per candelabrum 
repraesentabatur caelum spirituale, n. 9548, ideo per `ascendere facere lucernas' significatur lux caeli spiritualis; lux caeli spiritualis est Divinum Verum procedens a Domino, et inde fides ac intelligentia 
veri et sapientia boni, (d)videantur citata n. 9548. Quomodo cum luce caeli spiritualis {1}se habet, paucis dicetur: in regno caelesti Domini, quod est intimum seu tertium caelum, est lux quae 
immensum transcendit lucem quae in regno spirituali Domini, quod est medium seu secundum caelum; lux regni caelestis seu caeli intimi non apparet sicut lux sed sicut flamma; causa est quia in eo caelo 
regnat bonum amoris, et bonum amoris sistitur per flammam in caelo, at in regno spirituali Domini, quod est medium seu secundum caelum, est lux quae immensum transcendit lucem mundi, sed usque apparet 
{2} candida; causa est quia in eo caelo regnat verum fidei ex bono charitatis, et verum fidei ex eo bono sistitur per lucem candidam in caelo; inde quoque per `lucem' in Verbo significatur verum 
quod ex bono, et in supremo sensu Divinum Verum procedens (c)a Divino Bono Domini. Ex his nunc constare potest quid intelligitur per lucem caeli spiritualis, et quid per flammam lucernae, ex qua illa 
lux. @1 Before cum luce$ @2 i sicut lux$ </p>
