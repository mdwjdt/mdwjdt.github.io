<h3 align="center" class="ired">属天的奥秘 第7773节</h3>
<h4 align="center"></h4><p><strong>7773.</strong>“在法老的臣仆眼中和百姓眼中”表在那些在那里处于从属地位的人中间。这从“臣仆”和“百姓”的含义清楚可知，“臣仆”和“百姓”是指那些从属的人；因为“法老”代表侵扰者的首领，其余的都从属于他们。之所以表示那些从属的人，是因为恶人和善人一样，或说地狱和天堂一样，都有某种管理形式，也就是说，有处于管理地位的人，也有处于从属地位的人；没有这种管理形式，社群不会联结起来。但天堂的从属方式完全不同于地狱的。在天堂，所有人都是平等的，因为一个人爱另一个人，如同弟兄爱弟兄；然而，一个人会随着另一个人在聪明和智慧上胜过他自己而将他高举在自己之上。对良善和真理的真爱可以说使每个人自动将自己从属于那些在良善的智慧和真理的聪明上比他优越的人。然而，地狱的从属关系涉及残暴的统治，因而涉及冷酷无情。发号施令的人对那些不同意其一切命令的人冷酷无情。因为各人都视别人为自己的仇敌，尽管表面上为了联合起来反对他的暴力而对待他如同朋友。这种联合就像强盗的联合。那些处于从属地位的人不断渴望掌权，还经常在反抗中爆发。然后，那里的情况就变得可悲了，因为这时，他们向彼此行野蛮残酷的事。这种情况周期性地发生。由此可见来世的从属关系是什么样。</p>

In the eyes of Pharaoh's servants, and in the eyes of the people. That this signifies, with those who were in subordination there, is evident from the signification of "servants" and of "people," as 
being those who are subordinate; for by Pharaoh are represented the chief ones who infested, under whom the rest were subordinate. That the subordinate are signified is because among the evil as well 
as among the good, that is, in hell as in heaven, there is a form of government, that is, there is rule, and there is subordination, without which society would have no coherence. But the subordinations 
in heaven are wholly different from the subordinations in hell. In heaven all are like equals, for one loves another as brother loves brother; nevertheless one sets another before himself in proportion 
as he excels in intelligence and wisdom. The very love of good and truth causes everyone, as it were of himself, to subordinate himself to those who are superior to him in the wisdom of good and 
the intelligence of truth. But the subordinations in hell are those of despotic authority, and consequently of severity; for he who commands rages fiercely against those who do not favor all his commands; 
for everyone regards another as his enemy, although outwardly as a friend, for the sake of banding together against the violence of others. This banding together is like that of robbers. They who 
are subordinate continually aspire to rule, and also frequently break forth in revolt, and then the conditions there are lamentable, for then there are severities and cruelties and this takes place by 
alternations. From all this it can be seen how the case is with subordinations in the other life. </p>

'In the eyes of the servants and in the eyes of the people' means with those who were in subordinate positions there. This is clear from the meaning of 'the servants' and 'the people' as those who are 
subordinate; for 'Pharaoh' represents the chief ones who molested, under whom all the rest were subordinate. Those who were subordinate are meant because the evil no less than the good, or hell no less 
than heaven, have some system of government, that is to say, people in governing positions and those in subordinate ones, without which society would not hold together. But the way in which one person 
is subordinated to another in heaven is completely different from the way it happens in hell. In heaven all people are as equals, since one person loves another as brother loves brother; yet one 
exalts another above himself as that other excels him in intelligence and wisdom. A genuine love of what is good and true causes each one, spontaneously so to speak, to make himself subordinate to those 
who have a wiser discernment of good than he has and a more intelligent understanding of truth. Subordination in hell however involves domination and consequent ruthlessness. He who dominates behaves 
ruthlessly towards those who do not agree with every whim he has. For each one regards every one else as an enemy, though outwardly he treats him as a friend in order that they may band together to 
oppose the violence of others. Their banding together is like that of robbers. Those who are subordinate yearn constantly to dominate and also often break out in revolt. Then conditions there become 
deplorable, for then they do savage and cruel things to one another. This happens periodically. From all this one may see what subordination is like in the next life. </p>

`In oculis servorum, et in oculis populi': quod significet apud illos qui ibi in subordinatione erant, constat ex significatione `servorum et populi' quod sint qui subordinati; per `Pharaonem' enim 
repraesentantur primarii qui infestarunt, sub quibus subordinati reliqui.  Quod significentur subordinati, est quia (x) apud malos aeque ac apud bonos, seu in inferno ut in caelo, est forma regiminis, 
sunt nempe dominationes et sunt subordinationes, absque illis societas nec {1}cohaereret; sed subordinationes in {2}caelo plane aliter se habent quam subordinationes in {2}inferno; in caelo sunt omnes 
sicut pares, amat enim unus alterum ut frater fratrem; {3}usque tamen unus praefert alterum sibi sicut praestat intelligentia et sapientia; ipse amor boni et veri facit ut quisque se quasi ex se subordinet 
illis qui in sapientia boni et in intelligentia veri prae se sunt; subordinationes autem in inferno sunt imperii, et inde saevitiae qui imperat saevit in illos qui non omni (t)suo nutui favent; 
habet enim quisque alterum pro hoste, exterius autem pro amico, colligationis causa contra violentiam aliorum; colligatio illa est qualis latronum; subordinati {4}continue spirant ad dominium, et quoque 
erumpunt saepe; tunc status ibi lamentabilis, nam tunc saevitiae et crudelitates; hoc fit per vices.  Ex his constare potest quomodo se habet cum subordinationibus in altera vita. 	@1 cohaerit$ 	@2 
A transposes coelo and inferno$ 	@3 usque unus alterum praefert sibi, et id secundum intelligentiam et sapientiam$ 	@4 dominatorem odio habent, continue enim$ </p>
