<h3 align="center" class="ired">属天的奥秘 第6405节</h3>
<h4 align="center"></h4><p><strong>6405.</strong>“必有敌军毁坏他”表未经判断的行为或作为会把他从真理的状态中逐出。这从“敌军”和“毁坏他”的含义清楚可知。“敌军”（troop）是指行为或作为（参看<a href="3934.htm">3934</a>节），在此是指未经判断的行为或作为或作为；事实上，那些其行为或作为出于真理，尚未出于良善的人拥有一种模糊地、未被光照的理解力，而那些其行为或作为出于良善的人则有一种被光照的理解力，因为良善光照它，赋予它光明；来自主的真理之光通过良善流入心智的理解力部分，然后流入真理，而不是直接流入真理。其中的情形就像阳光，阳光通过热流入植物界的成员，如树木、幼苗、鲜花，使它们生长、开花；但阳光的直接流入却做不到；因为当光在没有热的情况下流入时，如在冬天，没有什么东西能生长、开花。“毁坏他”是指把他从真理的状态中逐出。<br />不过，有必要阐明“迦得”在此所表示的那些人到底是谁。他们就是那些在真理方面陷入幻觉，然而仍出于这幻觉行事的人；因此，这些不是真理的行为或作为，更不是良善的行为或作为。他们因这类行为或作为而从真理的状态中被逐出，因为一个处于真理，尚未处于良善的人一旦出于自己的宗教信仰而将某种观念付诸实践，那么以后就会维护这个观念，好像它就是绝对真理。他会持守此观念，不容改变，除非他进入良善。因为通过将观念付诸实践，他会全神贯注于它，迷恋它。行为或作为便以这种方式把他从真理的状态中逐出。除此之外，他信为真理的那些事并非真理，因为和“但”所表示的那些人一样，这些人也通过自己的感官进行判断，因而没有判断力。举例说明这个问题。有人持这样的观念：每个人都是同等的邻舍，因此要同等地向恶人和善人行善，他因向恶人行善而伤害他人。他在反复实践这个观念后，就会维护它，声称每个人都是他的邻舍，他并不关心一个人的品性如何，只关心向他行善。如此他所行的就未经判断，而且违背真正的真理；因为真正的真理是，所有人都是邻舍，但各自都是不同程度的邻舍；那些处于良善的人比其他人更是邻舍（参看<a href="2417.htm">2417</a>，<a href="3419.htm">3419</a>，<a href="3820.htm">3820</a>，<a href="5025.htm">5025</a>节）。<br />“迦得”还表示那些认为整个救恩唯独在于行为或作为的人，就像主在比喻中所提到的法利赛人：<br />法利赛人独自站着如此祷告，神啊，我感谢你，我不像别人勒索、不义、奸淫，也不像这个税吏。我一个礼拜禁食两次，凡我所得的都捐上十分之一。（路加福音<a href="http://39-27.cn/路18.11.htm">18:11</a>，<a href="http://39-27.cn/路18.12.htm">12</a>）<br />因此，他认为绝对真理就在于外在行为。诸如此类的人也在主的国度，但只在它的边缘，这就是为何主说：<br />我告诉你们，这税吏下去、到他家里，比那法利赛人倒算为义了。（路加福音<a href="http://39-27.cn/路18.14.htm">18:14</a>）<br />主如此说是在暗示，法利赛人也下去称义了，因为他出于顺服所吩咐的而行事。简言之，“迦得”代表那些将非真理称为真理，并出于这非真理而行事的人；因此，他们所行的就像真理，因为行为或作为无非是体现在行为中的意愿和理解力。拯救这些人的，并非他们行善的意图，而是在他们的无知里面的某种程度的纯真。<br />在以赛亚书中，“迦得”也表示那些出于不是真理，却被他们视为真理的东西而处于外在行为或作为的人：<br />但你们这些离弃耶和华、忘记我的圣山、给迦得摆筵席、给弥尼盛满调和酒的。（以赛亚书<a href="http://39-27.cn/赛65.11.htm">65:11</a>）<br />“给迦得摆筵席”表示唯独处于行为或作为。耶利米书：<br />论亚扪人，耶和华如此说，以色列没有儿子吗？没有后嗣吗？他的王为何得迦得之地为业呢？他的民为何住其中的城邑呢？（耶利米书<a href="http://39-27.cn/耶49.1.htm">49:1</a>）<br />“得迦得之地为业”表示活在来自非真理的行为或作为中；“亚扪人”是指那些歪曲真理，并照着这些被歪曲的真理生活之人（<a href="2468.htm">2468</a>节）；在此先知书中，论到迦得的这些话适用于他们。</p>

<p align="center"><b>Potts(1905-1910) 6405</b></p><p><b>6405.</b>
A troop shall ravage him. That this signifies works without judgment, that they will drive away from truth, is evident from the signification of a "troop," as being works (see n. 3934), here works without 
judgment; for they who do works from truth and not yet from good have obscure understanding, whereas they who do works from good have the understanding enlightened, because good enlightens; for 
the light of truth from the Lord flows into the intellectual through good, and thus into truth, but not into truth immediately. The case herein is like that of the sun's light, which inflows through heat 
into the subjects of the vegetable kingdom, trees, plants, and flowers, and causes them to grow and blossom, but not immediately; for when the light flows in without heat, as in winter, nothing grows 
and blossoms. Moreover "to ravage him" denotes to drive away from truth. [2] But who they are that are here signified by "Gad," shall be told. They are such as fall into illusion with respect to 
truth, and yet do works from this; thus works not of truth, still less of good. By such works they are driven away from truth, for as soon as a man who is in truth and not yet in good brings anything 
into act from his religiosity, he afterward defends it as if it were the veriest truth, and abides in it, nor does he admit any amendment of it, except insofar as he comes into good; for by so acting 
he imbues himself with it and loves it. Thus works drive him away from truth. Besides, he believes those things to be truths which are not truths, for these persons also, like those signified by "Dan," 
judge from what is sensuous, thus without judgment. Let this be illustrated by examples. When one who counts everyone equally his neighbor, and thus benefits the evil equally with the good, and by thus 
conferring benefits on the evil does harm to others, has committed such acts repeatedly, he afterward defends them, saying that everyone is his neighbor, and that it is not his concern what his quality 
is, but only to confer benefits on him; thus he does works without judgment, and also contrary to the truth itself; for the truth itself is that all are the neighbor, but in a different degree, 
and that they are the neighbor more than others who are in good (see n. 2417, 3419, 3820, 5025). [3] By "Gad" are also signified those who make all salvation consist in works alone, like the Pharisee 
of whom the Lord says in the parable: </p>
<p>     The Pharisee standing by himself prayed thus, God, I thank Thee that I am not as other men, extortioners, unjust, adulterers, or even as this publican. I fast 
twice in the week, I give tithes of all that I possess (Luke 18:11, 12); </p>
<p>thus holding external things as the veriest truths. They who are such are also in the Lord's kingdom, but on the threshold, 
and therefore the Lord says, "I say unto you, the publican went down to his house justified more than the Pharisee" (Luke 18:14), thus that the Pharisee also went down justified, because he had done 
works from obedience to command. In a word, by Gad are represented those who call that truth which is not truth, and from this non-truth do works; hence their works are like the truths, for works are 
nothing but the will and understanding in act. That which saves these men is the intention to do what is good, and something of innocence in their ignorance. [4] They who are in external works from 
that which is not truth, but which they believe to be truth, are signified by "Gad" also in Isaiah: </p>
<p>     Ye that forsake Jehovah, that forget the mountain of My holiness, that set out a table for Gad, 
and that fill a drink-offering unto Meni (Isa. 45:11); </p>
<p>"to set out a table for Gad" denotes to be in works alone. And in Jeremiah: </p>
<p>     Against the sons of Ammon, thus saith Jehovah: [Are there no 
sons] to Israel? hath he no heir? wherefore doth his king inherit Gad, and his people dwell in the cities thereof? (Jer. 49:1);  "to inherit Gad" denotes to live in works from that which is not truth; 
the "sons of Ammon" are they who falsify truths, and live according to them when falsified (n. 2468), to whom these things about Gad are applied by the prophet. </p>

<p align="center"><b>Elliott(1983-1999) 6405</b></p><p><b>6405.</b>
'A troop will ravage him' means that works performed without judgement will dislodge him from a state of truth. This is clear from the meaning of 'a troop' as works, dealt with in <a href="3934.htm">3934</a>, here works performed 
without judgement, for those who perform works that are motivated by truth but not as yet by good have a darkened understanding, whereas those whose works are motivated by good have an enlightened 
understanding because that good gives it light (the light of truth from the Lord flows by way of good into the understanding part of the mind, then on into truth, but not directly into truth, much 
as sunlight flows by means of heat into members of the vegetable kingdom - such as trees, young plants, and flowers - and causes them to grow and blossom; the direct inflow of sunlight does not cause 
them to do so, for when light flows in without heat, as in wintertime, nothing grows or blossoms); and from the meaning of 'ravaging him' as dislodging him from a state of truth. </p>
<p></p>
<p><b>[2]</b>
 But one must 
state who exactly those people are who are meant here by 'Gad'. They are those who suffer delusions regarding what is true and yet are led by their deluded view of it to perform works, so that these 
are not works of truth, much less of good. Through those works they are dislodged from a state of truth, for as soon as the person guided by truth but not as yet by good is moved on religious grounds 
to put some idea into practice, he then defends that idea as though it were the absolute truth. He sticks to it and does not allow it to be altered except insofar as he moves on into good. For by putting 
the idea into practice he becomes engrossed in it and enamoured with it. In this way works dislodge him from a state of truth. But quite apart from all this, he believes things to be true which are 
not so; for these people too, like those meant by 'Dan', judge a thing from their senses, thus without judgement. Let some examples shed light on the matter. Take a person who has the idea that one 
person is his neighbour in exactly the same way as any other and who for that reason does what is good in exactly the same way to the evil as to the good, and by doing good to the evil, he does harm to 
others. After he has put the idea into practice several times he then defends it, saying that everyone is his neighbour, and that he is not concerned with what a person is like, only with doing good 
to him. Thus his works are performed without judgement, and he also acts in ways contrary to the real truth, for the real truth is that all are one's neighbour but each is so in a different degree, and 
that those governed by good are pre-eminently one's neighbour, <a href="2417.htm">2417</a>, <a href="3419.htm">3419</a>, <a href="3820.htm">3820</a>, <a href="5025.htm">5025</a>. </p>
<p></p>
<p><b>[3]</b>
 'Gad' also means those who think that the whole of salvation rests in works alone, like the Pharisee to 
whom the Lord referred in His parable,  </p>
<blockquote>
The Pharisee stood and prayed these words to himself, God, I thank You that I am not like all other people - extortioners, unjust ones, adulterers, or even 
as this tax collector. I fast twice in a week; I give tithes of all that I possess. <a href="http://bible.gospelcom.net/cgi-bin/bible?passage=Luke%2018:11,%2012&amp;version=ESV&amp;interface=print&amp;showfn=yes&amp;showxref">Luke 18:11, 12</a>. 
</blockquote>
<p>Thus he thought that absolute truths consisted in external actions. People such as he are also in 
the Lord's kingdom, though only on the edge of it, which is why the Lord says, </p>
<blockquote>
I tell you, the tax collector went down to his house [more] justified than the other. <a href="http://bible.gospelcom.net/cgi-bin/bible?passage=Luke%2018:14&amp;version=ESV&amp;interface=print&amp;showfn=yes&amp;showxref">Luke 18:14</a>. 
</blockquote>
<p>In saying this He 
implied that the Pharisee too went down justified, since he had performed works because of the command to do them. In short, 'Gad' represents those who declare that to be true which is not in fact so 
and who are motivated to perform works by what is not in fact the truth. Consequently their works and truths are alike, for works are nothing else than will and understanding expressed in action. What 
saves those people is their intention to do what is good and the presence of a measure of innocence within their ignorance. </p>
<p></p>
<p><b>[4]</b>
 People motivated to perform works of an external nature by what they 
believe to be true but which is not in fact so are also meant by 'Gad' in Isaiah, </p>
<blockquote>
You who forsake Jehovah, who forget My holy mountain, who set a table for Gad, and who fill a drink-offering for 
Meni. <a href="http://bible.gospelcom.net/cgi-bin/bible?passage=Isa%2065:11&amp;version=ESV&amp;interface=print&amp;showfn=yes&amp;showxref">Isa 65:11</a>. . 'Setting a table for Gad' stands for an interest solely in works. And in Jeremiah, </p>
<p>Against the sons of Ammon. Thus said Jehovah, Israel, has he no heir? Why then does his king 
inherit God, and his people dwell in his cities? <a href="http://bible.gospelcom.net/cgi-bin/bible?passage=Jer%2049:1&amp;version=ESV&amp;interface=print&amp;showfn=yes&amp;showxref">Jer 49:1</a>. 
</blockquote>
<p>'Inheriting Gad' stands for leading a life in which works are motivated by what are not truths. 'The sons of Ammon' are people who falsify 
truths and lead lives in accordance with those falsified truths, <a href="2468.htm">2468</a>, and these things said about Gad in this prophet apply to them. </p>

`Turma depopulabitur illum':  quod significet opera absque judicio quod a vero deturbabunt, constat a significatione `turmae' quod sint opera, de qua n. 3934, hic opera absque judicio, nam qui ex vero 
et nondum ex bono opera faciunt, {1} habent {2}intellectum obscuratum, qui autem ex bono, habent {2}intellectum illustratum, nam bonum illustrat; lux enim veri a Domino influit in intellectuale per 
bonum, ac ita in verum, non autem in verum immediate; (o)se habet hoc sicut lux solis, haec in subjecta regni vegetabilis, ut in arbores, plantas, flores, influit per calorem et facit ut crescant et 
floreant, non autem immediate, nam cum lux influit absque calore, nihil crescit et floret, ut tempore hiemis; et ex significatione `depopulari illum' quod sit a vero deturbare. [2] Quinam {3}autem illi 
sunt qui hic per Gadem significantur, dicendum: sunt qui hallucinantur de vero, et ex eo tamen opera faciunt, ita opera non veri, minus opera boni; per opera inde deturbantur a vero, nam ut primum homo 
qui in vero est et nondum in bono, ex religioso aliquid in actum mittit, id postea defendit sicut foret ipsissimum verum, et manet in illo, nec admittit, nisi quantum in bonum venit, emendationem, 
per actum enim imbuit illud et amat illud; ita opera deturbant illum a vero; praeter quod illa credat vera esse quae non vera sunt, nam ex sensuali etiam hi, sicut qui per `Danem' significantur, judicant, 
ita absque judicio; sint exempla illustrationi: qui pro proximo unumquemvis aequaliter habet, et sic benefacit {4}aequaliter malis ac bonis, et per id quod {5}benefaciat malis, malefacit aliis; 
is postquam hoc aliquoties in actum miserat, postea defendit, dicendo quod unusquisque proximus sit, et quod sibi non curae sit qualis sit, modo benefaciat; ita opera absque judicio facit, et quoque contra 
ipsum verum, nam ipsum verum est quod omnes sint proximus sed in dissimili gradu, et quod proximus prae aliis sint qui in bono, n. 2417, 3419, 3820, 5025.  [3] Per `Gadem' etiam significantur qui 
in solis operibus ponunt omne salutis, {6} sicut Pharisaeus de quo Dominus in parabola, Pharisaeus stans apud seipsum haec orabat; Deus, gratias  ago Tibi quod non sim sicut reliqui homines, rapaces, 
injusti, moechi; aut etiam sicut hic publicanus; jejuno bis in septimana, decimas do omnium quae possideo, Luc. xviii 11, 12; </p>
<p>ita externa pro ipsissimis veris habuit; qui tales sunt, etiam in regno 
Domini sunt verum in limine; quapropter dicit Dominus, Dico vobis, descendit publicanus justificatus in domum  suam, quam Pharisaeus, ibid. vers. 14; </p>
<p>ita quod Pharisaeus etiam justificatus descenderit, 
quia opera ex mandato fecerat.  Verbo, per `Gadem' repraesentantur illi qui verum dicunt quod non verum est, et ex illo non vero faciunt opera, inde opera illorum sunt sicut vera {7}, nam opera 
non sunt nisi quam voluntas et intellectus in actu; {8} quod illos salvat, est intentio bonum faciendi, {9}et aliquid innocentiae in ignorantia.  [4] Qui in externis operibus sunt ex non vero quod credunt 
esse verum, per `Gadem' significantur etiam apud Esaiam, Vos qui deseritis Jehovam, qui obliviscimini montis sanctitatis  Meae, qui disponitis Gadi mensam, et qui impletis {10}Menio libamen, lxv 
11; </p>
<p>`disponere Gadi mensam' pro in solis operibus {11}esse: et apud Jeremiam, Contra filios Ammonis, Sic dixit Jehovah... Israeli, Num heres non illi? quare hereditat rex ejus Gadem, et populus ejus 
in urbibus illius habitat? xlix 1; </p>
