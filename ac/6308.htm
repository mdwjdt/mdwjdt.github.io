<h3 align="center" class="ired">属天的奥秘 第6308节</h3>
<h4 align="center"></h4><p><strong>6308.</strong>该流注通过灵人和天使实现。流注的次序是：恶灵首先流入，然后天使驱散他们的行为，也就是驱散他们所带来的东西。人并没有意识到这种流注的存在，因为他的思维通过这两种流注之间的平衡被保持在自由的状态，还因为他没有注意到这些事。恶人即便注意到，也不知道它们，因为他们当中没有邪恶与良善之间的平衡。但处于良善的人能知道；他们还从圣言知道他们里面有某种东西与他们里面的邪恶并虚假争战，并且属灵人与属世人争战；因此，处于人的内层和属灵事物的天使与处于人的外层和属世事物的恶灵争战。也正因如此，教会被称为“精兵”。 但从恶灵所流入的邪恶，只要人不去接受，不会对他造成任何伤害；然而，他若接受，并将它转入意愿，就会把它变成自己的。当他如此行时，便更加接近地狱灵这一方，远离天堂天使。这就是主在马可福音（马可福音<a href="http://39-27.cn/可7.14.htm">7:14</a>-<a href="http://39-27.cn/可7.23.htm">23</a>）中的教导，在那里，祂说：进入人里面的东西不能污秽人，惟有从他里面出来的，乃能污秽人，因为这些东西是从心里，也就是从地狱发出的。</p>

This influx is effected by means of spirits and angels. The order of the influx is that evil spirits first flow in, and the angels disperse their action. That there is such an influx the man does not 
perceive, because his thought is kept in freedom by means of the equilibration between these two influxes, and because he does not attend to such things; nor could the evil know if they did attend, because 
with them there is no equilibrium between evil and good. But they who are in good can know it; and they also know from the Word that there is something within which fights against the evil and 
falsity with them, and that the spiritual man fights against the natural; thus the angels, who are in man's interiors and in his spiritual things, against the evil spirits who are in his exteriors and 
in his natural things; and it is also from this that the church is called militant. But the evil which flows into the thought from the evil spirits, does the man no harm if he does not receive it; but 
if he receives it and transfers it from the thought into the will, he makes it his own; and he then goes over to the side of the infernal spirits, and withdraws from the angels of heaven. This is what 
the Lord teaches when He says that the things which enter into a man do not make him unclean; but the things which go out of him, because these go forth from the heart, that is, from the will (Mark 
7:14-23). </p>

That influx is effected through spirits and angels; and the order in which they flow in is evil spirits first, then angels who dispel what those spirits bring. Not that a person is aware of the existence 
of such influx, because his thought is preserved in a state of freedom created through its being poised between those two kinds of influx and because he does not pay any attention to such things. 
Wicked people could not know them even if they did pay them any attention, because with them there is no counterpoise of evil and good; but people governed by good can know. They also know from the Word 
that something is present inside them which is at war with the evil and falsity in them, and that the spiritual man is at war with the natural man, thus that angels who are in the interior and spiritual 
parts of his being are at war with evil spirits who are in the exterior and natural parts. This also goes to explain why the Church is called the Church militant. </p>

<p><b>[2]</b>
 But the evil that flows 
from evil spirits into a person's thought does him no harm whatever if he does not accept it. If he does accept it however and transfers it from thought to will he makes it his own. When he does that 
he draws nearer the parts where hellish spirits are and away from the angels of heaven. This is the Lord's teaching in <a href="http://bible.gospelcom.net/cgi-bin/bible?passage=Mark%207:14-27&amp;version=ESV&amp;interface=print&amp;showfn=yes&amp;showxref">Mark 7:14-27</a>, where He says that the things going into a person do not render him 
unclean, only those coming out, because they come from his heart or will. </p>

Influxus ille fit per spiritus et {1} angelos; ordo influxus est talis quod spiritus mali primum influant, et quod angeli dissipent illa; quod influxus talis sit, homo non percipit quia cogitatio ejus 
tenetur in libero per aequilibrationem inter binos illos influxus, et quia {2}homo non attendit ad illa; {3}mali nec scire {4}possent si attenderent, quia apud illos non est aequilibrium inter malum 
et bonam; sed qui in bono sunt, illi id scire possunt; etiam sciunt ex Verbo quod aliquod intus sit quod pugnat contra malum et falsum apud illos, {5}et quod spiritualis homo contra naturalem, ita angeli 
qui in interioribus hominis et in ejus spiritualibus, contra malos spiritus qui in ejus exterioribus {6}et naturalibus sunt; [2] inde etiam Ecclesia vocatur pugnans. {7}At malum quod a malis spiritibus 
influit in cogitationem, homini nihil quicquam nocet si non recipit illud; si {8}enim recipit illud et a cogitatione transfert in voluntatem, tunc id facit suum; ac tunc accedit ad partes spirituum 
infernalium et recedit ab angelis caeli; hoc est quod Dominus docet apud Marcum, Quod quae ingrediuntur in hominem, non immundum illum reddant sed quae egrediuntur, quia haec ex corde seu ex voluntate,
