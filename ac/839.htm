<p><strong>[NCE]839.</strong> <a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_839/bible_king-james-version_genesis_8_1" target=_top>Genesis 8:1</a>. And God remembered Noah, and every wild animal and every beast that was with him in the ark. And God made a wind pass over the earth, and the waters subsided.<br />God remembered symbolizes the end of trial and the beginning of renewal. Noah symbolizes the people of the ancient church, as he did before. Every wild animal and every beast that was with him in the ark symbolizes everything that was in those people. And God made a wind pass over the earth, and the waters subsided, symbolizes putting everything in its proper place. </p>

Verse 1. And God remembered Noah, and every wild animal, and every beast that was with him in the ark; and God made a wind to pass over the earth, and the waters assuaged. "And God remembered" signifies 
the end of temptation and beginning of renovation; by "Noah" is signified, as before, the man of the Ancient Church; by "every wild animal and every beast that was with him in the ark" are signified 
all things that he had; and by "God made a wind to pass over the earth, and the waters assuaged" is signified the disposal of all things into their order. </p>

Verse 1 And God remembered Noah, and every wild animal, and every beast that was with him in the ark. And God made a wind pass over the earth, and the waters subsided.  </p>
<p>'God remembered' means the 
end of temptation and the start of renewal. 'Noah', as previously, means the member of the Ancient Church. 'Every wild animal and every beast that was with him in the ark' means all things that resided 
with him. And God made a wind pass over the earth, and the waters subsided' means the arrangement of all things into their proper order. </p>

</p><b>839.</b>
Vers. 1.  Et recordatus est Deus Noahi, et omnis ferae, et omnis bestiae, quae cum illo in arca; et transire fecit Deus ventum super terram, et desederunt aquae.  'Recordatus est Deus' significat finem 
tentationis et principium renovationis: per 'Noahum' significatur, ut prius, homo Antiquae Ecclesiae: per 'omnem feram, et omnem bestiam quae cum illo in arca' significantur omnia quae apud illum: 
'et transire fecit Deus ventum super terram, et desederunt aquae' significant dispositionem omnium in suum ordinem. </p>
