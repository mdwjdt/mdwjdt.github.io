<h3 align="center" class="ired">属天的奥秘 第5801节</h3>
<h4 align="center"></h4><p><strong>5801.</strong>“你们有父亲、有兄弟没有”表作为源头的良善和作为方法的真理。这从以色列和便雅悯的代表清楚可知：以色列，即此处的“父亲”是指属灵良善或真理之良善（参看<a href="3654.htm">3654</a>，<a href="4598.htm">4598</a>节），之所以是指作为源头的良善，是因为属世层中的真理就源于属灵良善；便雅悯，即此处的“兄弟”，是指真理，之所以是指作为方法的真理，是因为雅各的儿子们所代表的属世层中的教会真理便通过这真理而与“以色列”所代表的属灵良善联结。由于联结是通过该真理实现的，所以经上大量描述了他们的父亲如何爱代表这真理的便雅悯，以及犹大如何无法与其余的人一起回到他们父亲那里，除非便雅悯与他们同在。关于这真理，可参看下文（<a href="5835.htm">5835</a>节）。</p>

Have ye a father, or a brother? That this signifies the good which is the source, and the truth which is the means, is evident from the representation of Israel, who is here the "father," as being spiritual 
good or the good of truth (see n. 3654, 4598), that it is the good which is the source, is because the truths in the natural are from the spiritual good; and from the representation of Benjamin, 
who is here the "brother," as being truth; that it is the truth which is the means, is because through this there is conjunction of the truths of the church in the natural (which Jacob's sons represent) 
with the spiritual good which is "Israel;" and as the conjunction is through this, it is described in many passages how his father loved Benjamin who represents this truth, and how Judah could not 
return with the others to his father unless Benjamin were with them. (In regard to this truth, see below, n. 5835.) </p>

<p align="center"><b>Elliott(1983-1999) 5801</b></p><p><b>5801.</b>
'Have you a father, or a brother?' means the good that is the source, and the truth that is the means. This is clear from the representation of Israel, to whom 'a father' refers here, as spiritual good 
or the good of truth, dealt with in <a href="3654.htm">3654</a>, <a href="4598.htm">4598</a>, good that is the source being meant because spiritual good is the source from which truths in the natural derive; and from the representation of Benjamin, 
to whom 'a brother' refers here, as truth, truth that is the means being meant because truth is the means by which the truths of the Church present in the natural, represented by 'Jacob's sons', 
are joined to spiritual good, represented by 'Israel'. And since the joining together is effected by means of that truth, much is said about how their father loved Benjamin, who represents that truth, 
and about how Judah together with the rest could not return to their father unless Benjamin was with them. For more about that truth, see below in <a href="5835.htm">5835</a>.<A name="fntext1"></a><A href="#fn1"><sup>a</sup></a>

`An sit (x)vobis pater vel frater?': quod significet quod sit bonum a quo, et verum per quod, constat a repraesentatione `Israelis' qui hic est `pater', quod sit bonum spirituale seu bonum veri, de 
qua n. 3654, 4598; quod sit bonum a quo, est quia a bono spirituali sunt vera in naturali; et a repraesentatione `Benjaminis' qui hic `frater', quod sit verum; quod sit verum per quod, est quia per illud 
conjunctio est verorum Ecclesiae in naturali quae `filii Jacobi' repraesentant, cum bono spirituali quod `Israel'; et quia conjunctio per illud, describitur multis quomodo pater amavit Benjaminem 
qui id verum repraesentat, et quomodo Jehudah cum reliquis non reverti potuerunt ad patrem suum nisi Benjamin esset cum illis. De hoc vero videatur infra n. {1}5835. @1 5804$ </p>
