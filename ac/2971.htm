<h3 align="center" class="ired">属天的奥秘 第2971节</h3>
<h4 align="center"></h4><p><strong>2971.</strong>“那块田和其中的洞”表在信之良善与真理方面。这从“田”和“洞”的含义清楚可知。“田”是指教会，以及构成教会的良善本身。属天之物或源于对主之爱和对邻之仁的良善好比“土地”，以及“田”，也被如此称呼。因为属天之物或良善是信之真理的接受者，这些真理好比“种”，也被如此称呼。“洞”是指处于模糊状态下的信之真理（参看<a href="2935.htm">2935</a>节）。之所以说信之真理处于模糊状态，是因为它在属灵之人身上（参看<a href="1043.htm">1043</a>，<a href="2708.htm">2708</a>，<a href="2715.htm">2715</a>节）。</p>

The field and the cave that was therein. That this signifies as to the good and the truth of faith, is evident from the signification of "field" as being the church, also the good itself of the church. 
The celestial, or good, which is of love to the Lord and of charity toward the neighbor, is compared to "ground," and also to "field;" it is also called "ground" and "field;" because the celestial 
or good is that which receives the truths of faith, which are compared to seeds and are also called "seeds." The same is evident also from the signification of a "cave," as being the truth of faith which 
is in obscurity (see n. 2935); it is said to be in obscurity because it is with the spiritual (see n. 1043, 2708, 2715). </p>

'The field and the cave which was in it' means as regards the good and truth of faith. This is clear from the meaning of 'the field' as the Church and also good itself which constitutes the Church (that 
which is celestial - or good that stems from love to the Lord and charity towards the neighbour - is compared to 'the ground' as well as to the field, and is actually called these, because that which 
is celestial - or good - is the recipient of the truths of faith; and these truths are compared to and are also actually called 'seeds'); and from the meaning of 'a cave' as the truth of faith which 
is enveloped in obscurity, dealt with in <a href="2935.htm">2935</a>. It is said to be in obscurity because it is with spiritual people, see <a href="1043.htm">1043</a>, <a href="2708.htm">2708</a>, <a href="2715.htm">2715</a>. </p>

`Ager et spelunca quae in illo': quod significet quoad bonum et verum fidei, constat a significatione `agri' quod sit Ecclesia, tum ipsum bonum quod est Ecclesiae; caeleste, seu bonum quod est amoris 
in Dominum et charitatis erga proximum, comparatur humo, tum quoque `agro,' etiam dicitur humus et ager, quia caeleste seu bonum est quod recipit vera fidei, quae comparatur seminibus, etiam vocantur 
semina; et a significatione `speluncae' quod sit verum fidei quod in obscuro, de qua n. 2935; in obscuro dicitur quia apud spirituales,{1} n. 1043, 2708 pr., 2715.  @1 i videatur$  </p>
