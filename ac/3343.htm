<h3 align="center" class="ired">属天的奥秘 第3343节</h3>
<h4 align="center"></h4><p><strong>3343.</strong>内层天堂天使的交流是更为优美、愉悦的代表；但成形于代表的这些观念无法用言语来表达。即便表达出来，它们不仅超出人的理解，还令人难以置信。属灵的代表，就是真理的代表，是通过天堂之光的改变实现的，天堂之光含有情感在里面，这些情感具有无穷的奇妙变化；而属天的代表，就是良善的代表，是通过天堂的火焰，或天堂之热的变化实现的；他们以这种方式激发一切情感。人脱离肉身后也会进入这种内在交流的能力中，但前提是，他在世时处于属灵良善，就是信之良善，或也可说对邻之仁中。因为他里面就具有这种交流能力，尽管他自己没有意识到。</p>

The speech of the angels of the interior heaven is still more beautifully and pleasantly representative; but the ideas which are representatively formed are not expressible by words, and if they should 
be expressed by any, they would surpass not only apprehension, but also belief. Spiritual things, which are of truth, are expressed by modifications of heavenly light, in which are affections, which 
are wonderfully varied in innumerable ways; and celestial things, which are of good, are expressed by variations of heavenly flame or heat; so that they move all the affections. Into this interior speech 
also man comes after the separation of the body, but only the man who during his life in this world is in spiritual good, that is, in the good of faith, or what is the same, in charity toward the 
neighbor; for he has this speech within himself, though he is unaware of it. </p>

The communication of angels who belong to the interior heaven is even more beautifully and delightfully representative, but the ideas which take shape in representatives cannot be put into words. If 
they were to be put into any words at all they would go not only beyond what anyone is able to grasp but also beyond what anyone is able to believe. Spiritual representatives, which are those of truth, 
are effected by means of modifications of heavenly light which have affections within them that are wonderfully varied in unlimited ways; while celestial representatives, which are those of good, are 
effected by variations of heavenly flame or warmth. In this way they stir all the affections. Into this interior ability to communicate also man enters following his separation from the body, but this 
happens only to one in whom spiritual good, that is, the good of faith, is present, or what amounts to the same, to one in whom, while living in the world, charity towards the neighbour is present. 
For he has that charity within him even though he himself is not aware of it. </p>

Loquela angelorum interioris caeli est adhuc pulchrius et amoenius repraesentativa, sed ideae quae repraesentative formantur, non sunt expressibiles vocibus; et si exprimerentur aliquibus, excederent 
non modo captum sed etiam fidem; spiritualia {1}quae sunt veri, fiunt per modificationes lucis caelestis, in quibus affectiones, quae indefinitis modis mirabiliter variantur; et caelestia quae sunt 
boni, per variationes flammae seu caloris caelestis; ita movent omnes affectiones. In hanc interiorem loquelam etiam venit homo post corporis separationem, sed modo qui in bono spirituali est, hoc est, 
in bono fidei, seu quod idem, in charitate erga proximum {2}, cum vivit in mundo; nam interius in se illam habet tametsi hoc nescit. @1 i seu$  @2 i est$  </p>
