<h3 align="center" class="ired">属天的奥秘 第4449节</h3>
<h4 align="center"></h4><p><strong>4449.</strong>“他的灵魂恋慕你们的女儿，求你们将她给示剑为妻”表与这个外表类似古教会的新教会结合的渴望。这从“灵魂恋慕”和“将她给为妻”的含义，以及“底拿”的代表清楚可知：“灵魂恋慕”是指一种渴望；“底拿”，就是此处的“女儿”是指对真理的情感，因而是指教会，因为教会凭对真理的情感而成为教会，此处的“新教会”就是指这种教会；“将她给为妻”是指结合（参看<a href="4434.htm">4434</a>节）。<br />至于建立在雅各后代中的新教会外表类似古教会，要知道，通过摩西给以色列和犹太民族所规定的律例、典章和律法，与存在于古教会中的的律例、典章和律法没什么不同，如涉及订婚和结婚的，涉及奴仆的，涉及适合食用的活物和不适合食用的活物的，涉及洁净、节日、会幕、永火，以及许多其它事物的；还有涉及祭坛、燔祭、祭物、奠祭的，它们在始于希伯的第二代古教会中也是被接纳的。所有这些在它们被指示给这个民族之前就为人所知，这一事实从圣言的历史很明显地看出来。<br />仅以祭坛、燔祭和祭物为例。论到巴兰：他被吩咐筑七座坛，在上面献上公牛和公羊为燔祭和祭物（民数记<a href="http://39-27.cn/民23.1.htm">23:1</a>，<a href="http://39-27.cn/民23.2.htm">2</a>，<a href="http://39-27.cn/民23.14.htm">14</a>，<a href="http://39-27.cn/民23.15.htm">15</a>，<a href="http://39-27.cn/民23.29.htm">29</a>）。除此之外，许多地方也讲述了这些民族，如他们的祭坛被毁；还讲述了以利亚所杀的巴力的先知，这些先知献了祭。由此明显可知，给雅各的后代所规定的祭物并不是新的；其它律例、典章和律法也不是新的。但由于这些事物在各民族当中已沦为偶像崇拜，尤其他们用这类事物来敬拜某个世俗的神，从而将神性事物的代表转向地狱之物，更不用说他们所加添的其它代表了，故为了恢复古教会的代表性敬拜，这些事物重新被召回。由此明显可知，建立在雅各后代当中的这个新教会外表类似古教会。</p>

His soul longs for your daughter, give her I pray to him for a woman. That by this is signified a desire for conjunction with this new church which appears in outward form like the Ancient Church, is 
evident from the signification of the "soul longing for," as being a desire; from the representation of Dinah who here is the "daughter," as being the affection of truth, and consequently the church, 
for the church is the church from the affection of truth, and this is here meant by the "new church;" and from the signification of "giving her for a woman," as being conjunction (see n. 4434). [2] 
As regards the fact that the new church set up among the descendants of Jacob appeared in the outward form like the Ancient Church, be it known that the statutes, judgments, and laws commanded to the 
Israelitish and Jewish nation through Moses, were not foreign to the statutes, judgments, and laws that existed in the Ancient Church, such as those relating to betrothals and marriages, to servants, 
to the animals that were good for eating and those which were not, to cleansings, festivals, the tabernacles, the perpetual fire, and many other things; and also those concerning altars, burnt- offerings, 
sacrifices, and libations, which were received in the second Ancient Church which was from Eber. That these were known before they were commanded that nation, is very evident from the historicals 
of the Word, as for example the altars, burnt-offerings, and sacrifices. [3] It is said of Balaam that he ordered seven altars to be built, and burnt-offerings and sacrifices of bullocks and rams to 
be offered upon them (Num. 23:1, 2, 14, 15, 29). And it is also related of the nations in many places that their altars were destroyed; and also of the prophets of Baal whom Elijah slew, that these offered 
sacrifices. From all this it is evident that the sacrifices commanded to the people of Jacob were not new, and so neither were the rest of their statutes, judgments, and laws. But because these 
things had become idolatrous among the nations, especially in that by such things they worshiped some profane god, and thus turned to what is infernal the representatives of Divine things, not to mention 
their addition of other representatives, therefore in order that the representative worship of the Ancient Church might be restored, the same things were recalled. Hence it is evident that this new 
church, instituted among the descendants of Jacob, appeared in the outward form like the Ancient Church. </p>

'His soul longs for your daughter; give her, I beg you, to him for a wife' means a longing to be joined to this new Church which in outward appearance was similar to the Ancient Church. This is clear 
from the meaning of 'the soul's longing' as a longing; from the representation of Dinah, to whom 'daughter' refers here, as the affection for truth, and therefore as the Church, for a Church is a Church 
by virtue of its affection for truth - such a Church being meant here by a new Church; and from the meaning of 'giving her for a wife' as a joining together, dealt with in <a href="4434.htm">4434</a>. </p>
<p></p>
<p><b>[2]</b>
 As regards 
that new Church which was established among the descendants of Jacob being in outward appearance similar to the Ancient Church, it should be realized that the statutes, judgements, and laws which were 
prescribed through Moses for the Israelite and Jewish nation were no different from the statutes, judgements, and laws which existed in the Ancient Church, such as those concerning betrothals and marriages, 
concerning slaves, concerning the living creatures which were suitable for food and those which were not suitable, concerning cleansings, festivals, tabernacles, the perpetual fire, and many other 
things; also concerning altars, burnt offerings, sacrifices, libations, that had been received in the second Ancient Church which began with Eber. The fact that all of these were known before they 
were prescribed for that nation is quite evident from the historical descriptions of the Word. </p>

<p><b>[3]</b>
 Take merely altars, burnt offerings, and sacrifices. Of Balaam it is recorded that he ordered them 
to build seven altars and to offer on them burnt offerings and sacrifices of young buss and rams, <a href="http://bible.gospelcom.net/cgi-bin/bible?passage=Num%2023:1,%202,%2014,%2015,%2029&amp;version=ESV&amp;interface=print&amp;showfn=yes&amp;showxref">Num 23:1, 2, 14, 15, 29</a>. Besides this, it is said of the nations in many places, that their altars 
were to be destroyed; and of the prophets of Baal whom Elijah slew, that they offered sacrifices. These facts make it clear that sacrifices which were prescribed for the descendants of Jacob were not 
new; nor were the rest of the statutes, judgements, and laws. But because these things became idolatrous among the nations - in particular through their use of those things to worship some profane god, 
which resulted in them turning representatives of Divine things to what is of hell, in addition to the many: practices which they added to these - those same things were reinstated so that the representative 
worship of the Ancient Church might be restored. From this it becomes clear that this new Church which was established among Jacob's descendants was in outward appearance similar to the Ancient Church. </p>

`Desiderat anima illius in filiam vestram, detis quaeso eam illi ad mulierem': quod significet desiderium conjunctionis cum nova hac quae apparet externa facie antiquae similis, constat ex significatione 
`desiderare anima' quod sit desiderium; ex repraesentatione `Dinae' quae hic est filia {1}, quod sit affectio veri, proinde Ecclesia, quam Ecclesia ab affectione veri est Ecclesia,' haec {2} 
per novam illam (o)hic intelligitur; et ex significatione `dare eam ad {3} mulierem' quod sit conjunctio, de qua n. 4434.  [2] Quoad id quod nova illa Ecclesia, quae apud posteros Jacobi instaurata 
est, appareat externa facie Antiquae similis, sciendum quod statuta, judicia et leges quae genti Israeliticae et Judaicae per Mosen mandata sunt, non aliena fuerint a statutis, judiciis et legibus 
quae in Antiqua Ecclesia, sicut quae de (t)desponsationibus et conjugiis, de servis, de animalibus quae ad esum conducerent et non conducerent, de mundationibus, de festis, tabernaculis, igne perpetuo, 
et de pluribus aliis: etiam de altaribus, holocaustis, sacrificiis, libaminibus, quae recepta fuerunt in altera Ecclesia Antiqua quae ab Ebero; quae quod nota fuerint prius quam mandata sunt 
genti illi, patet manifeste `ab historicis Verbi; ut solum quod (o)altaria, holocausta et sacrificia {4}; [3] de Bileamo memoratur,           Quod jusserit ut aedificarentur septem altaria, et  
    super illis holocausta et sacrificia ex juvencis et      arietibus offerrentur, Num. xxiii 1, 2, 14, 15, 29; </p>
<p>et praeterea de gentibus, multis in locis, quod destruerentur (t)illarum altaria; et 
quoque de prophetis Baalis quod sacrificaverint, quos Elias interfecit; inde constare potest quod sacrificia quae mandata fuerunt posteris {5} Jacobi, non fuerint nova; ita nec {6} reliqua statuta, 
judicia et leges; sed quia haec facta sunt idololatrica apud gentes, cumprimis per id quod per talia colerent aliquem deum profanum, et sic quae repraesentabant Divina, deflecterent ad infernalia, 
praeter quod superaddiderint plura, ideo ut cultus repraesentativus qui luit Antiquae Ecclesiae, restauraretur, eadem revocata sunt: inde constare potest quod nova haec Ecclesia, quae apud posteros 
Jacobi instituta est, apparuerit externa facie Antiquae similis.      @1 ex significatione filiae, hic Dinae$      @2 quae hic$      @3 in$      @4 i attinet$      @5 populo I$      @6 sed
