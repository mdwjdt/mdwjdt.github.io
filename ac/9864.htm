<h3 align="center" class="ired">属天的奥秘 第9864节</h3>
<h4 align="center"></h4><p><strong>9864.</strong>“要有四行石头，依次是”表它们，也就是说，源于良善的一切真理都联结在一起。这从“四”和“（四）行石头”的含义清楚可知：“四”是指结合或联结（参看<a href="1686.htm">1686</a>，<a href="9601.htm">9601</a>，<a href="9674.htm">9674</a>节）；“（四）行石头”是指在其适当次序中的源于良善的真理。经上规定它们分为四行，每行三样石头，是为了可以代表源于同一种良善的一切真理联结在一起，以及由此它们的完美；因为“四”表示结合或联结，如前所述，“三”表示完美（<a href="9825.htm">9825</a>节）。事实上，当一切真理都从同一种良善发出（<a href="9863.htm">9863</a>节），并因此都关注同一种良善时，这良善就是那将它们都联结在一起的。<br />天上所发生的事可用来说明这一切，并表明事实的确如此。在天堂，所有人，无一例外，都将脸转向主；令人惊奇的是，无论他们转到哪个方向，都是这种情况。正因如此，天堂里的所有人都联结为一体。但那些在天堂之外的人却将脸转离主；他们离天堂越远，就将脸转离得越远。结果，他们之间就有了分离，因为他们不爱神或他们的邻舍，只爱自己和世界。不过，对那些照着感官幻觉进行思考的人来说，这个奥秘让人难以置信；因为他们根本无法理解，天上的每一张脸无论朝哪个方向转，如何能始终朝向主，也就是那里的太阳（关于这个主题，可参看<a href="9828.htm">9828</a>节所引用的内容）。</p>

Four rows of stones, a row. That this signifies the conjunction of all, namely, of truths from good, is evident from the signification of "four," as being conjunction (see n. 1686, 9601, 9674); and from 
the signification of "rows of stones," as being truths from good in their order. That there were four rows, and in each row three stones, was in order that there might be represented the conjunction 
of all truths from one good, and thereby perfection; for by "four" is signified conjunction (as said above), and by "three," perfection (n. 9825); for when there is one good from which all truths proceed 
(n. 9863), and to which therefore all look, then this one good is the conjunction of all.  [2] That it is so may be illustrated by what exists in the heavens. All in the heavens without exception 
turn their faces to the Lord, and wonderful to say, this is the case to whatsoever quarter they may turn. It is from this that all who are in the heavens are conjoined as a one. But those who are 
outside heaven turn their faces backward from the Lord, and the more so the more remote from heaven they are; consequently with them there is disjunction, because with them there is no love toward God 
and toward the neighbor; but love toward self and the world. But this secret is incredible to those who think according to the fallacies of the senses; for these cannot comprehend how in every change 
of position the direction of all faces in heaven can possibly be constantly to the Lord, who is the Sun there. (See what was adduced above on this subject, n. 9828.). </p>

'There shall be four rows of stones, the order being' means all of them joined together, that is to say, all the truths springing from good. This is clear from the meaning of 'four' as a joining together, 
dealt with in <a href="1686.htm">1686</a>, <a href="9601.htm">9601</a>, <a href="9674.htm">9674</a>; and from the meaning of 'rows of stones' as truths springing from good in their proper order. The setting of them in four rows, three in each row, was decreed in 
order that the joining together of all the truths springing from the same good, and so their perfection, might be represented; for 'four' means a joining together, as has been stated, and 'three' means 
perfection, <a href="9825.htm">9825</a>. Indeed since one and the same good is the source from which they all emanate, <a href="9863.htm">9863</a>, and is consequently the one to which they all look back, that good is what joins them all together.

<p><b>[2]</b>
 Things that happen in heaven may serve to cast light on all this and show that it is so. All without exception in heaven turn their face towards the Lord; and - marvel that it is - this happens 
whatever direction they turn to face. As a consequence of this all who are in heaven are joined together as one. But those who are outside heaven turn their face away from the Lord; and the further 
away they are from heaven the further away their faced is turned. As a consequence of this there is division among them, because they do not love God or their neighbour, only themselves and the world. 
But this is an arcanum which for those whose thought is ruled by the illusions of the senses is inconceivable; for they cannot at all comprehend how every face in heaven can be always looking, in 
whatever direction its owner turns, towards the Lord, who is the Sun there. See what has been introduced above in <a href="9828.htm">9828</a> on this subject.  </p>

`Quattuor ordines lapidis, ordo': quod significet conjunctionem omnium, nempe verorum ex bono, constat ex significatione `quattuor' quod sint conjunctio, de qua n. 1686, 9601, 9674, et ex  significatione 
`ordinum lapidis' quod sint vera ex bono in suo ordine.  Quod fuerint quattuor ordines, et in quovis ordine tres lapides, erat causa ut repraesentaretur conjunctio omnium verorum ex uno bono, et 
sic perfectio; per quattuor enim significatur conjunctio, ut dictum est, et per tria perfectio, n. 9825, cum enim unum bonum est ex quo omnia procedunt, n. 9863, {1} consequenter quod omnia spectant, 
tunc id est omnium conjunctio; [2] quod ita sit, illustrari potest ex illis quae existunt in caelis: omnes quicumque in caelis sunt vertunt faciem ad  Dominum, et quod mirabile, ita fit ad quamcumque 
plagam se convertunt; inde est quod omnes qui in caelis sunt conjuncti sint sicut unum; at qui extra caelum sunt vertunt {2}facies retro a Domino, {3}et eo magis quo remotiores sunt a caelo; inde apud 
illos est disjunctio, {4}quia non amor erga Deum et erga proximum, sed erga se et erga mundum.  Sed hoc arcanum (t)non est credibile illis qui secundum fallacias sensuum cogitant, hi enim non comprehendere 
possunt quomodo directio omnium facierum in caelo possit dari constans ad Dominum, Qui ibi est Sol, in omni conversione; videantur {5}quae de hac re supra n. 9828 allata sunt. @1 i et$ @2 facies 
altered to faciem$ @3 ac retro$ @4 et inde non in amore erga proximum sunt, sed in odio, et odium est disjunctio$ @5 i etiam$ </p>
