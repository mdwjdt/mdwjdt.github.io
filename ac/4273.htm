<h3 align="center" class="ired">属天的奥秘 第4273节</h3>
<h4 align="center"></h4><p><strong>4273.</strong>“只剩下雅各”表已经获得并在此情况下成为良善的末后或终极形式的真理之良善。这从“雅各”的代表清楚可知，“雅各”在此是指真理之良善。前面章节已说明“雅各”代表什么，他代表属世层里面良善与真理的各种关系。因为真理与良善的状态在一开始是一种，在发展过程中是另一种，在结束时又是一种（<a href="3775.htm">3775</a>，<a href="4234.htm">4234</a>节）。在此他代表真理之良善。这种代表的原因在于，接下来所论述的主题是他的摔跤，摔跤在内义上表示试探；因为他被取名叫“以色列”，以色列就代表属天-属灵之人；还因为摔跤之后，下文描述了他与以扫的结合，这种结合就表示真理引入良善。这些就是为何“雅各”现在代表属世层里面真理之良善的末后或终极形式的原因。</p>

And Jacob remained alone. That this signifies the good of truth procured, which was in this case the last or ultimate, is evident from the representation here of Jacob, as being the good of truth. What 
Jacob had represented has been shown in the preceding pages, and also that he represented various things in the natural, because the state of truth and good is of one kind in the beginning, of another 
in its progress, and still another in the end (n. 3775, 4234); here, he represents the good of truth. The reason of this representation is that his wrestling is presently treated of, by which in the 
internal sense is signified temptation; and because he was named "Israel," by whom is represented the celestial spiritual man; and also because in what next follows his conjunction with Esau is treated 
of, by which conjunction is signified the initiation of truth into good. These are the reasons why Jacob now represents the last or ultimate good of truth in the natural. </p>

'Jacob remained alone' means the good of truth, which had now been arrived at and was at this point the ultimate form of good. This is clear from the representation of 'Jacob' at this point as the good 
of truth. What 'Jacob' had represented has been shown in previous paragraphs, as also has the fact that he represented varying relationships of good and truth within the natural. For these exist together 
in one condition at the beginning of a process, in another during it, and in yet another at the end of it, <a href="3775.htm">3775</a>, <a href="4234.htm">4234</a>. At present he represents the good of truth. The reason for this representation 
is that the subject dealt with next is his wrestling, which in the internal sense means temptation, and that he was named Israel, after which he represents the celestial-spiritual man. And a further 
reason is that after that wrestling his reunion with Esau is described, by which the introduction of truth into good is meant. These are the reasons why 'Jacob' now represents the ultimate form of 
the good of truth within the natural. </p>

</p><b>4273.</b>
`Remansit Jacob solus':  quod significet bonum veri comparatum, quod tunc ultimum, constat a repraesentatione `Jacobi' hic quod sit bonum veri: quid `Jacob' repraesentaverat, in praecedentibus ostensum 
est, tum quod varia in naturali, quia status veri et boni est alius in principio, alius in progressu, et alius in fine, n. 3775, 4234, hic bonum veri: causa hujus repraesentationis est quia 
agitur mox de luctatione ejus, per quam in sensu interno significatur tentatio; et quia nominatus Israel, per quem repraesentatur caelestis spiritualis homo; tum in dein sequentibus quia agitur de 
conjunctione illius cum Esavo, per quam conjunctionem significatur initiatio veri in bonum; hae causae sunt quod `Jacob' nunc repraesentet bonum veri ultimum in naturali. </p>
