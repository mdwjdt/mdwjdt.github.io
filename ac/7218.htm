<h3 align="center" class="ired">属天的奥秘 第7218节</h3>
<h4 align="center"></h4><p><strong>7218.</strong>“苦工”表由于被完全的虚假侵扰。这从“苦工”的含义清楚可知，“工”是指虚假的侵扰（参看<a href="7120.htm">7120</a>，<a href="7129.htm">7129</a>节）；因此，“苦工”是指被完全的虚假侵扰。因为那些被完全的虚假侵扰，没有被驱散这些虚假的真理复活的人，即便所过的生活是信之真理和仁之良善的生活，也会承受最大的痛苦；只要这种状态持续，他们就处在苦工之中。正因如此，“苦工”表示这种侵扰。要知道，思维的一切元素都是从一个外在源头流入的；但当灵人经历晚上和黑夜的状态时，他们的思维处于一个强迫的状态；在这种状态下，他们被迫思想正在被引入的虚假，完全无法摆脱这种强迫状态。但当他们经历早晨和中午的状态时，他们的思维处于一个自由的状态；因为那时，他们被允许思想他们所爱的东西，因而思想信与仁的真理与良善，因为这些是他们爱的对象。凡源于爱的东西就是自由（参看<a href="2870.htm">2870</a>-<a href="2893.htm">2893</a>节）。</p>

And for hard service. That this signifies by infestations from mere falsities, is evident from the signification of "service," as being infestation by falsities (see n. 7120, 7129); thus "hard service" 
denotes infestation by mere falsities; for they who are infested by mere falsities, and are not revived by truths whereby the falsities may be shaken off (and yet their life is the life of the truth 
which is of faith and of the good which is of charity), are in the greatest anguish, and so long as they are in this state, they are as it were in hard service. Hence it is that such infestations are 
signified by "hard service." Be it known that everything of thought flows in, but when spirits are in a state of evening and night, their thought is then in a forced state, they being then compelled 
to think of the falsities which are being injected, and not being able to at all loose themselves from this compulsion. But when it is the state of morning and midday with them, their thought is in a 
free state, for then they are allowed to think of things which they love, thus of the truths and goods of faith and charity, for these belong to their love. (That this freedom is that which belongs to 
the love, see n. 2870-2893.) </p>

'And for hard servitude' means as a result of molestations by utter falsities. This is clear from the meaning of 'servitude' as molestation by falsities, dealt with in <a href="7120.htm">7120</a>, <a href="7129.htm">7129</a>, so that 'hard servitude' 
is molestation by utter falsities. For those who are molested by utter falsities and are not refreshed with truths to dispel those falsities, even though the life they lead is a life made up of 
the truth of faith and the good of charity, suffer the greatest agony; and as long as that state lasts they are subject to a kind of hard servitude. So it is that such molestations are meant by 'hard 
servitude'. It should be recognized that every element of thought flows in from an outside source, but that when spirits pass through the state of evening and night they are compelled during that state 
to think about the falsities which are introduced, and are totally unable to break free from that state of compulsion. But when they pass through the state of morning and noon their thought is in a 
state of freedom; for then they are allowed to think about the things they love, thus about the truths and forms of good that compose faith and charity since these are the objects of their love. Freedom 
consists in whatever springs from love, see <a href="2870.htm">2870</a>-<a href="2893.htm">2893</a>. </p>

`Et prae servitio duro': quod significet ab infestationibus ea meris falsis, constat ex significatione `servitii' quod sit infestatio a falsis, de qua n. 7120, 7129, ita servitium durum est infestatio 
a meris falsis, nam qui infestantur a {1}mere falsis, et non refocillantur per vera per quae falsa discutiantur, et tamen vita illorum est vita veri quod fidei et boni quod charitatis, illi in maximo 
angore sunt, et quamdiu in illo statu, quasi in duro servitio sunt; inde est quod tales infestationes per `servitium durum' significentur.  Sciendum quod omne cogitationis influat, sed quando spiritibus 
est status vesperae et noctis, quod tunc cogitatio illorum in statu coacto sit, {2}tunc coguntur cogitare de falsis quae injiciuntur, et {3} ex coactione illa se exsolvere nequicquam {4}possunt; 
ast cum illis {5}est status mane et meridiei, tunc cogitatio illorum in statu libero est, {6}nam tunc licet illis cogitare de illis quae amant, ita de veris et bonis fidei et charitatis, {7}nam haec 
amoris illorum sunt; quod id liberum sit quod est amoris, videatur n. 2870-2893. 	@1 meris$ 	@2 et cogantur$ 	@3 i quod$ 	@4 possint; at$ 	@5 After meridiei$ 	@6 et$ 	@7 quae, quia affectionis
