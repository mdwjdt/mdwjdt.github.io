<h3 align="center" class="ired">属天的奥秘 第3749节</h3>
<h4 align="center"></h4><p><strong>3749.</strong>有一个灵人不知不觉地来到我这里，流入我的头部。灵人能根据他们所流入的不同身体部位而被识别出来。我想知道他是谁，打哪来。但他沉默了一段时间后，与我同在的天使说，他是从与如今仍活在世上的某个有学问的人同在的灵人那里被选出来的。他（也就是那个有学问的人）追求学问胜过别人的名声。那时，通过这个中间灵人与这个人的思想进行交流也是被允许的。我问这个灵人，那个有学问的人对大人和它的流注，以及随之而来的对应关系能形成什么样的概念。他说，他形不成任何概念。接着，我又问他，那个人对天堂持什么样的概念。他说，除了亵渎神明的概念外，他根本没有任何概念，还以为天上的人整天在演奏乐器，就像乡下人经常演奏小调一样。然而，人们高估了这个人，以为他知道什么是流注，什么是灵魂，以及灵魂与身体相互作用的性质；或许还以为他比其他人更清楚天堂是什么。由此可见如今那些教导别人的人都是些什么人；也就是说，他们是在用纯粹的绊脚石来反对信之良善与真理，尽管他们公开发表过不同的言论。</p>

A certain spirit came to me unawares, and flowed into my head. Spirits are distinguished according to their influx into different parts of the body. I wondered who and whence he was; but after he had 
been silent for some time the angels who were with me said that he had been taken from among the spirits who were with a certain learned man still living in the world, who had gained extraordinary reputation 
for his learning. Communication was also then given through this intermediate spirit with the thought of that man. I asked the spirit what idea this learned man was enabled to form concerning 
the Grand Man, and concerning its influx and consequent correspondence. He said that he could form no idea. He was next asked what idea he had of heaven. He said that he had none at all, except blasphemous 
ones-as that people there are always playing on musical instruments such as rustics are wont to make a sound with. And yet this man is held in high estimation, and is believed to know what influx 
is, and what the soul is, and what is the nature of its interaction with the body; and possibly it is believed that he knows better than other men what heaven is. From this it is evident what sort 
of men are now the teachers of others, namely, that from mere objections and difficulties they oppose the goods and truths of faith, although they publish the contrary. </p>

A certain spirit came to me without warning and flowed into my head (spirits can be identified one from another by whatever parts of the body they flow into). I wondered who he was and where he came 
from. But after he had stayed silent for some while the angels present with me said that he had been chosen from the spirits present with some learned person still alive in the world today. He - that 
is, the learned man - had sought the reputation of possessing more learning than others. At that point communication through this intermediary spirit with the thought of that man was also permitted. I 
asked the spirit what idea that learned man was able to have about the Grand Man and about its influx, and therefore about correspondence. He replied that he was able to have none. After that I asked 
what idea did that man have of heaven. He said, None at all, apart from blasphemous ones, such as that those in heaven spend their time playing musical instruments like those on which country people 
are accustomed to produce a tune. Yet that individual is held in higher esteem than others and is thought to know what influx is, what the soul is, and what its interaction with the body is. He is also 
probably thought to have greater knowledge than others of what heaven is. This shows what those are really like who teach others at the present day; that is to say, using mere stumbling-blocks they 
oppose the goods and truths of faith, though publicly they declare something different. </p>

Quidam spiritus inopinato ad me venit ac influebat in caput, secundum influxus in partes corporis etiam dignoscuntur spiritus, mirabar quis esset et unde, sed postquam aliquantum tacuisset, dicebant 
angeli qui apud me, quod ex spiritibus apud aliquem eruditum hodie adhuc in mundo viventem, desumptus sit, qui, nempe eruditus, famam eruditionis prae aliis captaverat; dabatur etiam tunc per spiritum 
illum intermedium communicatio cum cogitatione illius hominis; quaerebam spiritum quam ideam habere posset eruditus ille de Maximo Homine et de ejus influxu, ac inde correspondentia; dicebat 
quod nullam posset: deinde quam ideam haberet de caelo; dicebat non aliquam, solum blasphemias, sicut quod ibi instrumentis musicis plauderent, ac talibus quibus rustici solent sonorum quoddam edere: 
et tamen ille aestimatus est prae aliis, et creditur quod sciat quid influxus, et quid anima, et quid commercium ejus cum corpore; fortassis etiam creditur quod prae aliis sciat quid caelum: inde 
constare {1}potest quales illi hodie sunt qui alios docent, quod nempe ex meris scandalis sint contra bona et vera fidei, tametsi aliud evulgant. @1 potuit$ </p>
