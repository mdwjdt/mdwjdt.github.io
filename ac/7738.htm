<h3 align="center" class="ired">属天的奥秘 第7738节</h3>
<h4 align="center"></h4><p><strong>7738.</strong>“因为你见我面的那日，你就必死”表它若真的进入他们的心智，就会被根除。这从“见面”和“死”的含义清楚可知：“见面”是指进入心智，如刚才所述（<a href="7737.htm">7737</a>节）；“死”是指被根除。法老现在之所以说摩西“从他面前走开！摩西见他面的那日，就必死”，是因为现在描述的是侵扰者在沉浸于由邪恶所生的纯粹虚假之时的状态，这虚假由“幽暗”来表示。地狱里的人越沉浸于邪恶所生的虚假，就越厌恶真理，最终厌恶到不肯听见有关真理的任何事的地步。因为真理与虚假相反，虚假是他们所喜爱的，因为虚假所源于的邪恶是他们生命的快乐。正因如此，他们将真理从其心智中完全逐出，因为真理违背他们生命的愉悦和快乐；他们若听见它，就会受到折磨（<a href="7519.htm">7519</a>节）。正因如此，由于他们的状态是由邪恶所生的虚假的状态，这种状态由“幽暗”来表示，所以他们远离“摩西”所代表的神之真理。这就是为何法老现在对摩西说摩西，他要“从他面前走开！不要再见我的面，摩西若见到，就必死”。这也是为何摩西回答说“你说得对，我必不再见你的面了”。</p>

For in the day thou seest my faces thou shalt die. That this signifies that if it entered into the mind it would be rooted out, is evident from the signification of "seeing the faces," as being to enter 
into the mind (as just above, n. 7737); and from the signification of "dying," as being to be rooted out. That Pharaoh now says that Moses should "go away from before him, and that if he saw his faces 
he should die," is because there is now described the state of the infesters in mere falsity from evil, which falsity is signified by the "thick darkness." The more the infernals are in falsities 
from evil, the more they are averse to truth, and at last to such a degree that they are not willing even to hear anything of truth. For truth is contrary to falsity, and falsity is pleasant to them, 
because evil, from which is falsity, is the delight of their life; and therefore they utterly reject truth from their minds, because it is contrary to the pleasantness and delight of their life; and 
if they hear it they are tormented (n. 7519). It is for this reason that being in a state of falsity from evil, which is signified by "thick darkness," they remove from themselves the truth Divine which 
is represented by Moses, and therefore Pharaoh now said to Moses that he should "go away from before him and should see his faces no more, and if he saw, that he should die;" and therefore Moses replied, 
"thou hast rightly spoken, I will see thy faces again no more." </p>

<p align="center"><b>Elliott(1983-1999) 7738</b></p><p><b>7738.</b>
'For on the day you see my face you will die' means that if it did enter their mind it would be extirpated. This is clear from the meaning of 'seeing the face' as entering the mind, as immediately above 
in <a href="7737.htm">7737</a>; and from the meaning of 'dying' as being extirpated. The reason why Pharaoh now says that Moses should go from his presence and that if he saw his face he would die is that it now describes 
the state of the molesters when they are steeped in utter falsity arising from evil, the falsity meant by 'thick darkness'. The more that those in hell become steeped in falsities arising from evil, 
the more they loathe truth, and at length loathe it so much that they refuse even to listen to anything true. For truth is contrary to falsity, and falsity is what pleases them because the evil from 
which that falsity springs is the delight of their life. This being so, they banish truth altogether from their mind, because it is contrary to the pleasure and delight of their life. Or if they do listen 
to that truth they suffer torment, <a href="7519.htm">7519</a>, so it is that because their state is that of falsity arising from evil, the state meant by 'thick darkness', they remove themselves from God's truth, represented 
by 'Moses'. That was why Pharaoh now told Moses to go from his presence and not see his face, and that if he did see it he would die. It was also why Moses replied, 'Rightly have you spoken; 
I will not see your face ever again'.  </p>

`Quia in die videre te facies meas morieris': quod significet si intraret in animum, quod exstirparetur, constat ex significatione `videre facies' quod sit intrare in animum, ut nunc supra n. 7737; 
et ex significatione `mori' quod sit exstirpari.  Quod Pharao nunc dicat quod Moscheh abiret ab apud illum, et quod si videret facies ejus, moreretur, est quia nunc describitur status infestantium in 
mero falso ex malo, quod falsum significatur per `caliginem'; infernales, quo magis in falsis sunt ex malo, eo magis verum aversantur, et tandem adeo ut ne quidem velint aliquid veri audire; est enim 
verum contra falsum, et falsum est illis amoenum, quia malum ex quo falsum est jucundum vitae (c)illorum; {1}quapropter verum, quia est contra amoenum et jucundum vitae, ex animo prorsus rejiciunt; et 
si audiunt illud, cruciantur n. 7519; inde est quod, quia in statu falsi ex malo sunt, qui significatur per `caliginem,' verum Divinum, quod per Moschen repraesentatur, a se {2}amoveant; idcirco nunc 
dixit Pharao ad Moschen quod abiret ab apud se, et non videret facies suas, et si videret quod moreretur; idcirco {3}etiam Moscheh {4}respondit, `Recte locutus es, non addam amplius videre facies tuas.' 	@1
