Verses 18-21. And when men shall dispute, and a man shall smite his companion with a stone or with his fist, and he dieth not, and lieth down in bed; if he rise and walk abroad upon his staff, the smiter 
shall be guiltless; only he shall give his cessation, and healing he shall heal him. And when a man shall smite his manservant, or his maidservant, with a rod, and he die under his hand; in being 
avenged he shall be avenged. Nevertheless if he shall stand for a day or two, he shall not be avenged, because he is his silver.  "And when men shall dispute," signifies contention among themselves 
about truths; "and a man shall smite his companion with a stone, or with his fist," signifies the invalidating of some one [truth of the church] by reason of some memory or general truth; "and he dieth 
not," signifies and it is not extinguished; "and he lieth down in bed," signifies what is separate in the natural; "if he rise and walk abroad upon his staff," signifies the strength of life therein; 
"the smiter shall be guiltless," signifies not to be guilty of evil; "only he shall give his cessation," signifies indemnification; and "healing he shall heal him," signifies restoration; "and when 
a man shall smite his manservant, or his maidservant, with a rod," signifies if anyone within the church ill-treats the truth of memory or its affection from his own power; "and he die under his hand," 
signifies so that it is extinguished under his view; "in being avenged he shall be avenged," signifies the punishment of death; "nevertheless if he shall stand for a day or two," signifies a state of 
life abiding even to fullness; "he shall not be avenged," signifies no punishment of death; "because he is his silver," signifies what is acquired from one's own. </p>

<p>'And when men quarrel' means contention among them regarding truths. 
'And a man strikes his companion with a stone or a fist' means the weakening of one [particular truth] by some factual truth or by some general truth. 'And he does not die' means, and it is not wiped 
out. 'And lies down in bed' means separated in the natural. 'If he rises up and walks outside on his staff' means strength of life in that truth. 'The striker shall be innocent' means being not guilty 
of evil. 'But he shall pay for his cessation [from work]' means making good again. 'And thoroughly cure him' means restoration. 'And when a man strikes his male slave or his female slave with a rod' 
means if anyone within the Church mistreats a factual truth or an affection for it from his own power. 'And [the slave] dies under his hand' means so that it is wiped out under his contemplation. 'He 
shall certainly be avenged' means the punishment of death. 'However, if he stands for a day or two' means a state of life remaining until it is full. 'He shall not be avenged' means no punishment of 
death. 'Since he is his silver' means that which has been acquired from the self.

Vers. 18-21.  Et cum litigaverint viri, et percusserit vir socium suum lapide vel pugno, et non moritur, et decumbit in lecto, si surrexerit et ambulaverit foris super scipione suo, insons erit percutiens; 
tantum cessationem ejus dabit, et curando curabit.  Et cum percusserit vir servum suum aut ancillam suam baculo, et moriatur sub manu ejus, vindicando vindicabitur.  Attamen si diem vel biduum

significat non punitionem mortis: `quia argentum ejus ille' significat ex (m)proprio acquisitum.(n) </p>
