<h3 align="center" class="ired">属天的奥秘 第8022节</h3>
<h4 align="center"></h4><p><strong>8022.</strong>后来，木星的天使来了，我从他们与我的交谈得以发觉，他们和我们地球的天使完全不同。他们与我交流时不是用口头语言，而是用经由我内层朝四面八方传播的观念，还从那里转到我的脸上，如此强烈地影响它，以致我的脸照每个具体的观念而移动；从嘴唇开始，然后从各个方向朝我脸周围行进。取代话语的观念是离散的，但只是稍微离散。天使说，他们能以这种方式与自己星球的人对话；那里也有一种从嘴唇开始用脸交流的方式。</p>

Afterward the angels of that earth came, and it was given me to perceive from their speech with me that they are utterly different from the angels of our earth; for their speech was not effected by means 
of words, but by means of ideas which diffused themselves through my interiors on all sides, and from there had also an influx into the face, so that the face concurred to every particular; beginning 
from the lips, and proceeding toward the circumference on all sides. The ideas which were in the stead of words were discrete, but in a slight degree. They said that so do they speak with their own 
people on their earth; and that there also the speech is of the face, beginning from the lips. </p>

Then angels belonging to that planet arrived, and from the way they communicated with me I was made to realize that they were completely different from angels belonging to our planet. They did not use 
spoken words to communicate with me but ideas which entered my interiors, spread through them in every direction, and from there also passed on into my face, exerting so strong an influence on it that 
my face moved in accord with each particular idea. They began at the lips and then moved out in every direction towards the circumference of my face. These ideas taking the place of words were distinct 
from one another, though only slightly. The angels said that this was a way in which they could communicate with their people on their planet, and that there the method of communication was likewise 
one that employed the face, beginning at the lips. </p>

</p><b>8022.</b>
Postea venerunt angeli illius telluris, et {1} dabatur percipere ex loquela mecum quod prorsus (x)differrent ab angelis nostrae telluris; loquela enim illorum non fiebat per voces sed per ideas quae 
se per interiora mea undequaque diffundebant, et inde quoque influxum habebant in faciem, sic ut facies ad singula concurreret, incipiendo a labiis et pergendo versus circumferentiam undequaque; ideae 
quae loco vocum erant discretae erant sed perparum; dicebant quod ita eum suis in tellure sua loquerentur et quod ibi loquela quoque faciei sit incipiens a labiis. 	@1 i etiam$ </p>
