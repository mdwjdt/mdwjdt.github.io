<h3 align="center" class="ired">属天的奥秘 第827节</h3>
<h4 align="center"></h4><p><strong>827.</strong>那些打着婚姻之爱和对小孩子之爱的幌子欺骗之人，其行为是这样：丈夫没有怀疑其客人的贞洁、诚实和友好，他们在这种及其它各种伪装下更安全地通奸。他们在臀部下面的地狱，就在最污秽的粪便中，在此消磨直到变成骨头，因为他们在骗子之列。这种人甚至不知道何为良知。我与他们交谈过，他们惊讶于谁都应该有良知，并且理应声明通奸违背良知。他们被告知，没有良知的奸夫进入天堂，就象鱼儿跃入空中，或鸟儿飞入太空一样不可能。因为一旦靠近，他们就会感到窒息。其快乐转化为刺鼻的恶臭，故他们不得不被推入地狱，最终变得象骨头，少有生命。因为他们为自己获得这样一种特性，当他们失去这种生命后，真正的人类生命就只剩下一点痕迹。</p>

<p><strong>[NCE]827.</strong> There are some men who hide behind a love for marriage and a love for children in order to commit treacherous deeds. Their behavior prevents any suspicion on a husband's part that they as his guests are anything but chaste, innocent friends. Under such appearances and many others, they commit adultery in relative safety. These people live in a hell under the buttocks and in the filthiest excrement where, because they are among the deceitful, they undergo such devastation that they finally seem to turn into skeletons.<br />People like this do not even know what conscience is. I talked to them, and they were surprised that anyone might have a conscience or claim that adultery violates it. I told them that for adulterers of their type, who have no compunction, it is as impossible to come into heaven as it is for a fish to rise into the air or for a bird to fly up into the ether.{*1} Let them only edge close to heaven and they feel as though they would suffocate. The pleasure they feel turns into a stinking smell. They can only be thrust down into hell. Eventually they come to appear skeletal, with little life left, because this is the kind of life they have obtained for themselves, and when they lose it, only a tiny amount of truly human life remains.<br /><br /><strong>Footnotes:</strong><br />{*1} The term "ether" in this sense refers to a subtle and invisible atmosphere believed to surround the earth at a level above the familiar atmosphere; compare <a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_827/swedenborg_apocalypse-revealed-rogers_907" target=_top>Revelation Unveiled 907</a> and <a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_827/swedenborg_conjugial-love-rogers_188#subsection-2-3" target=_top>Marriage Love 188:3</a>. (For a summary of the various meanings of this term in Swedenborg, see Swedenborg [1771] 2006, 696 note 1 in <a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_827/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_114" target=_top>114</a>.)

Those who ensnare by pretended regard for conjugial love and love for children, so deporting themselves that the husband shall have no suspicion but that his guests are chaste, guileless, and friendly, 
and under such and various other pretenses the more safely commit adultery, are in a hell under the buttocks, in the filthiest excrement; and are vastated until they become as bones, because they rank 
with the deceitful. Such do not even know what conscience is. I have talked with them, and they were surprised that anyone should have conscience and should say that adulteries are contrary to conscience. 
They were told that it is as impossible for such conscienceless adulterers to come into heaven as it is for fishes to rise into the air, or birds into the ether, because if they but approach 
they have a feeling of suffocation, and their delight is turned into a noisome stench; and that they cannot but be thrust down into hell, and become at last as of bone, with little life, because they 
have acquired to themselves a life of such a character that when they lose it, very little of truly human life remains. </p>

<p align="center"><b>Elliott(1983-1999) 827</b></p><p><b>827.</b>
Those who beguile by means of conjugial love and love towards small children - behaving in such a way that a husband has no reason to suspect that his guests are anything else but clean-minded, stainless, 
and friendly, and so under this and many other pretences commit adultery more safely - are in a hell beneath the buttocks in foulest excrement. There they experience vastation until they are no 
more than bones, for they are among the deceitful. Such individuals do not even know what conscience is. I have spoken to them and they have been amazed that anyone should have a conscience and that people 
say that acts of adultery are contrary to conscience. They have been told that it is as impossible for such conscienceless adulterers to enter heaven as it is for a fish to survive in the air or 
a bird above the air. For when merely approaching heaven they feel as though they are being choked, and their kind of delight is converted into a dreadful stench. They are then driven inevitably down 
into hell and at length become just like bones with little life, for when they lose that kind of life which they have acquired to themselves, no more than a mere trace of truly human life remains. </p>

<p align="center"><b>Latin(1748-1756) 827</b>
</p><b>827.</b>
Qui insidiantur per amorem conjugialem et per amorem erga infantes, sic se gerendo ut maritus nullam suspicionem habeat quin hospites sint casti, insontes et amici, et sub tali specie, et alia multiplici, 
tutius adulterantur, ii sunt in inferno sub natibus in excrementis foedissimis, et devastantur usque dum fiunt sicut ossa, quia inter dolosos.  Tales ne quidem sciunt quid conscientia; locutus 
cum iis, et mirati quod aliquis habeat conscientiam et quod dicant adulteria esse contra conscientiam; quibus dictum, quod adulteris talibus absque conscientia tam impossibile sit in caelum venire, sicut 
est pisci in aerem, aut volucri in aetherem, quia dum modo approximant, sentiunt quasi suffocationem, et vertitur jucundum tale in fetorem graveolentum; tum quod non possint aliter quam detrudi in 
infernum, et fieri demum sicut ossei cum pauca vita, quia vitam sibi talem acquisiverant, quam cum amittunt tantillum vitae vere humanae remanet. </p>
