Verses 17-19. Thou shalt bring them in, Thou shalt plant them in the mountain of Thine inheritance, in the place Thou hast wrought for Thee to dwell, O Jehovah, the sanctuary, O Lord, Thy hands have 
prepared. Jehovah shall reign forever and to eternity. Because Pharaoh came with his chariot and with his horsemen into the sea, and Jehovah brought back the waters of the sea upon them; and the sons 
of Israel went on the dry through the midst of the sea. "Thou shalt bring them in," signifies elevation; "and plant them," signifies regeneration continually; "in the mountain of Thine inheritance" signifies 
heaven where is the good of charity; "the place for Thee to dwell in" signifies where the Lord is; "which Thou hast wrought, O Jehovah" signifies that it was from the Lord alone; "the sanctuary, 
O Lord, Thy hands have prepared, "signifies heaven where are they who are in the truth of faith from the Lord; "Jehovah shall reign forever and to eternity," signifies that the Lord alone is Lord of 
heaven and earth; "because the horse of Pharaoh came with his chariot and with his horsemen," signifies all falsities from a perverted intellectual with those who had been in faith separate and in a 
life of evil; "into the sea," signifies damnation; "and Jehovah brought back the waters of the sea upon them," signifies that the falsities from evils, which they intended for the good, returned upon 
themselves, by reason of the presence of the Lord with those who were in good; "and the sons of Israel went on the dry through the midst of the sea," signifies that they who were in the good of truth 
and in the truth of good passed safely through the region of that hell. </p>

Verses 17-19 You will bring them in, You will plant them on the mountain of Your inheritance, the place for You to dwell in [which] You have made, O Jehovah; the sanctuary, O Lord, [which] Your hands 
have prepared. Jehovah will reign for ever and ever.<A name="fntext1"></a><A href="#fn1"><sup>a</sup></a> For Pharaoh's horse came with his chariot and his horsemen into the sea, and Jehovah brought the waters of the sea back over them; and the children 
of Israel went on dry ground through the middle of the sea. </p>
<p>'You will bring them in' means raising up. 'And plant them' means regeneration going on continuously. 'On the mountain of Your inheritance' 
means the heaven where the good of charity resides. 'The place for You to dwell in' means where the Lord is. 'You have made, O Jehovah' means that it is accomplished by the Lord alone. 'The sanctuary, 
O Lord, [which] Your hands have prepared' means the heaven where those guided by the truth of faith coming from the Lord are. 'Jehovah will reign for ever and ever' means that the Lord alone is 
Lord of heaven and earth. 'For Pharaoh's horse came with his chariot and his horsemen' means all the falsities belonging to a perverted understanding that existed with those upholding separated faith 
and leading a life of evil. 'Into the sea' means damnation. 'And Jehovah brought the waters of the sea back over them' means that the falsities arising from evils which they aimed at the good recoiled 
on themselves, at the Lord's presence among those governed by good. 'And the children of Israel went on dry ground through the middle of the sea' means that those governed by the good of truth and guided 
by the truth of good passed over in safety through the region of that hell.

Vers. 17-19.  Introduces illos, plantabis illos in monte hereditatis Tuae, loco ad habitare Te, operatus es Jehovah, sanctuarium, Domine, praepararunt manus Tuae.  Jehovah regnabit in saeculum et aeternitatem. 
 Quia venit equus Pharaonis in curru suo et in equitibus suis in mare, et reduxit Jehovah super illos aquas maris; et filii Israelis iverunt in arido per medium maris.  `Introduces illos' 
significat elevationem: `et plantabis illos' significat regenerationem continue: `in monte hereditatis Tuae' significat caelum ubi bonum charitatis: {1} `loco ad habitare Te' significat ubi Dominus: `operatus 
es Jehovah' significat quod a Domino solo: `sanctuarium, Domine, (x)praepararunt manus Tuae' significat caelum ubi illi qui in vero fidei a Domino: `Jehovah regnabit in saeculum et aeternitatem' 
significat quod Dominus solus sit Dominus caeli et terrae: `quia venit equus Pharaonis in curru suo et in equitibus suis' significat omnia falsa ex intellectuali perverso apud illos qui in fide separata 
et vita mali: `in mare' significat damnationem: `et reduxit Jehovah super illos aquas maris' significat quod falsa ex malis quae intenderunt bonis relapsa sint super illos, ex praesentia Domini 
apud illos qui in bono: `et filii Israelis iverunt in arido per medium maris' significat quod illi qui in bono veri et vero boni tuto transiverint inferni illius regionem. 	@1 Pater in coelis written in m$ </p>
