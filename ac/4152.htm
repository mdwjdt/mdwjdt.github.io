<h4 align="center"></h4><p><strong>4152.</strong>创世记31:33-35.拉班进了雅各的帐棚、利亚的帐棚并两个使女的帐棚，都没有找到它们，就从利亚的帐棚出来，进了拉结的帐棚。拉结已经取了神像，把它们放在骆驼的稻草里，便坐在上头。拉班摸遍了那帐棚，没有找着。拉结对她父亲说，愿我主眼中没有怒气，因为我正有妇事儿，不能在你面前起来。这样，拉班搜寻神像，竟没有搜出来。<br />“拉班进了雅各的帐棚、利亚的帐棚并两个使女的帐棚，都没有找到它们”表它们的神圣事物中没有这类真理。“就从利亚的帐棚出来，进了拉结的帐棚”表那真理的神圣。“拉结已经取了神像”表出自神性的内在属世真理。“把它们放在骆驼的稻草里”表在记忆知识中。“便坐在上头”表它们是内层。“拉班摸遍了那帐棚，没有找着”表他自己的东西不在那里。“拉结对她父亲说”表对良善。“愿我主眼中没有怒气，我不能在你面前起来”表它们不能显露。“正有妇事儿”表它们尚在不洁之物当中。“这样，拉班搜寻神像，竟没有搜出来”表它们不是他的。</p>

Verses 33-35. And Laban came into Jacob's tent, and into Leah's tent, and into the tent of the two handmaids, and found them not; and he went out of Leah's tent, and came into Rachel's tent. And Rachel 
had taken the teraphim, and put them in the camel's straw, and sat upon them; and Laban felt about all the tent, and found them not. And she said to her father, Let there not be anger in the eyes of 
my lord, that I cannot rise up before thee, for the way of women is upon me. And he searched, and found not the teraphim. "And Laban came into Jacob's tent, and into Leah's tent, and into the tent of 
the two handmaids, and found them not," signifies that in their holy things there were not such truths; "and he went out of Leah's tent, and came into Rachel's tent," signifies the holy of that truth; 
"and Rachel had taken the teraphim," signifies interior natural truths which were from the Divine; "and put them in the camel's straw," signifies in memory-knowledges; "and sat upon them" signifies 
that they are interior; "and Laban felt about all the tent, and found them not," signifies that that which was his own was not there; "and she said to her father," signifies to good; "let there not be 
anger in the eyes of my lord, that I cannot rise up before thee," signifies that they cannot be revealed; "for the way of women is upon me," signifies that as yet they were among unclean things; "and 
he searched, and found not the teraphim," signifies that they were not his. </p>

Verses 33-35 And Laban came into Jacob's tent, and into Leah's tent, and into the tent of both servant-girls, and did not find them. And he went out of Leah's tent and came into Rachel's tent. And Rachel 
had taken the teraphim and put them in the camel's straw, and sat on them. And Laban felt around all the tent and did not find them. And she said to her father, Let there not be any anger in my lord's 
eyes, for I cannot rise up before you, for the way of women is upon me. And he searched and did not find the teraphim. </p>
<p>'Laban came into Jacob's tent, and into Leah's tent, and into the tent of 
both servant-girls, and did not find them' means that within the holiness which these possessed no such truths were present. 'And he went out of Leah's tent and came into Rachel's tent' means the holiness 
of that truth. 'And Rachel had taken the teraphim' means interior natural truths which came from the Divine. 'And put them in the camel's straw' means in facts. 'And sat on them' means that they 
were interior. 'And Laban felt around all the tent and did not find them' means that what was his own was not there. 'And she said to her father' means to good. 'Let there not be any anger in my lord's 
eyes, for I cannot rise up before you' means that they are unable to be revealed. 'For the way of women is upon me' means that as yet they were among things that were unclean. 'And he searched and 
did not find the teraphim' means that they were not his. </p>

Vers. 33-35.  Et venit Laban in tentorium Jacobi, et in tentorium Leae, et in tentorium ambarum ancillarum, et non invenit et exivit e tentorio Leae et venit in tentorium Rachelis. Et Rachel accepit 
teraphim, et posuit illos in stramento cameli, et sedit super illis; et contrectabat Laban omne tentorium, et non invenit. Et dixit ad patrem suum, Ne succenseatur in oculis domini mei, quia non 
possum surgere coram te, quia via feminarum mihi; et scrutatus est, et non invenit; teraphim. `Venit Laban in tentorium Jacobi, et in tentorium Leae, et in tentorium ambarum ancillarum, et non invenit' 
significat quo in sanctis illorum non talia vera essent: </p>
<p>`et exivit e tentorio Leae et venit in tentorium Rachelis' significat sanctum illius veri: `et Rachel accepit teraphim' significat vera 
naturalia interiora quae a Divino: et posuit illos in stramento cameli' significat quod in scientificis: `et sedit super illis' significat quod interiora: `et contrectabat Laban omne tentorium et 
non invenit' significat quod ibi non esset quod ejus proprium: `et dixit ad patrem suum' significat ad bonum:  Ne succenseatur in oculis domini mei, quia non possum surgere a coram te' significat 
quod revelari non possint: `quia via feminarum mihi' significat quod adhuc inter immunda: `et scrutatus est, et non invenit teraphim' significat quod ejus non essent. </p>
