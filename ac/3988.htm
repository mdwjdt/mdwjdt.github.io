<h4 align="center"></h4><p><strong>3988.</strong>创世记30:31-33.拉班说，我当给你什么呢？雅各说，你什么也不必给我，只要你为我做这一件事，我就回头牧放、看守你的羊群。今天我要走遍你的羊群，从羊群中挑出一切有点有斑的羊，从羔羊中挑出一切黑色的羊，从母山羊中挑出有斑的、有点的，这些就算我的工价。次日我的公义便为我作答，因为你来查看我在你面前的工价；凡山羊中不是有点有斑的，羔羊中不是黑色的，都算是我偷的。<br />“拉班说，我当给你什么呢”表知晓。“雅各说”表回答。“你什么也不必给我，只要你为我做这一件事”表工价的确定应取决于源自真理的良善。“我就回头牧放、看守你的羊群”表拉班所代表的良善要有所履行的功用。“今天我要走遍你的羊群”表祂（真理的良善）认识到那一切良善的性质。“从羊群中挑出一切有点有斑的羊”表“拉班”所表示的良善与真理，凡与“斑”所表示的邪恶混杂，或与“点”所表示的虚假混杂的，都要被分离出去。“从羔羊中挑出一切黑色的羊”表属于“拉班”所表之良善的纯真自我。“从母山羊中挑出有斑的、有点的”表此后，有虚假和邪恶混杂在里面的一切真理之良善都将是“雅各”的。“这些就算我的工价”表这一切是祂自己努力的结果。“我的公义便为我作答”表祂所拥有的神性圣洁。“次日”表直到永恒。“因为你来查看我在你面前的工价”表祂自己的东西。“凡山羊中不是有点有斑的”表凡不是来源于拉班所表示的良善，并且没有与真理之良善里面的邪恶与虚假混杂的。“羔羊中不是黑色的”表纯真的第一个状态。“都算是我偷的”表这不是祂的。</p>

Verses 31-33. And he said, What shall I give thee? And Jacob said, Thou shalt not give me anything; if thou wilt do this word for me, I will return, and feed and keep thy flock. I will pass through all 
thy flock this day, removing from thence every small cattle that is speckled and spotted, and every black one among the lambs, and the spotted and speckled among the goats, and these shall be my reward. 
And my righteousness shall answer for me on the morrow, because thou comest upon my reward before thee; every one that is not speckled and spotted among the goats, and black among the lambs, stolen 
is this by me. "And he said, What shall I give thee?" signifies knowledge; "and Jacob said," signifies reply; "thou shalt not give me anything, if thou wilt do this word for me," signifies that it 
should be brought on the part of the good which is from truth; "I will return, and feed and keep thy flock," signifies that the good signified by Laban is to be applied to use; "I will pass through all 
thy flock this day," signifies that He perceives the quality of all the good; removing from thence every small cattle that is speckled and spotted," signifies that all the good that is His will be 
separated wherewith there is mingled evil (signified by the "speckled"), and falsity (signified by the "spotted"); "and every black one among the lambs," signifies an own that is innocent, which belongs 
to the good signified by "Laban;" "and the spotted and speckled among the goats," signifies that then all the good of truth in which falsity and evil are mingled shall be His; "and this shall be my 
reward," signifies that it was from Himself; "and my righteousness shall answer for me," signifies the Divine holiness which He had; "on the morrow," signifies to eternity; "because thou comest upon 
my reward before thee," signifies what is His own; "every one that is not speckled and spotted among the goats," signifies what is not from the good signified by "Laban" mingled with evil and falsity 
in the goods of truth; "and black among the lambs," signifies the first state of innocence; "stolen is this by me," signifies that it was not His. </p>

Verses 31-33 And he said, What shall I give you? And Jacob said, You shall not give me anything; if you will do this one thing for me, I will return, feed, and guard your flock. I will pass through all 
your flock today, removing from it every speckled and spotted member of the flock, and every black one among the lambs, and the spotted and speckled among the she-goats; and that will be my wages. 
And my righteousness will answer for me on the morrow, when you come [to look] over my wages that are before you; every one that is not speckled and spotted among the she-goats, and black among the lambs, 
is one stolen by me. </p>
<p>'He said, What shall I give you?' means knowledge. 'And Jacob said' means a reply. 'You shall not give me anything; if you will do this one thing for me' means that the finding 
of the wages should rest with the good that springs from truth. 'I will return, feed, and guard your flock' means that the good meant by Laban has a use to perform. 'I will pass through all your 
flock today' means that [the good of truth] recognizes the nature of all that good. 'Removing from it every speckled and spotted member of the flock' means that everything good and true that is meant 
by 'Laban' and which - when mingled with evil, meant by 'speckled', or mingled with falsity, meant by 'spotted' - will be separated. 'And every black one among the lambs' means a proprium of innocence, 
which belongs to the good meant by 'Laban'. 'And the spotted and speckled among the she-goats' means that after this all the good of truth that has falsity and evil mingled within it will be 'Jacob's'. 
'And that will be my wages' means that it was the result of His own effort. 'And my righteousness will answer for me' means the Divine holiness which He possessed. 'On the morrow' means into eternity. 
'When you come [to look] over my wages that are before you' means what was His own. 'Every one that is not speckled and spotted among the she-goats' means that which does not originate in the good 
meant by Laban and is not mingled with evil and falsity within the goods of truth. 'And black among the lambs' means the first state of innocence. 'Is one stolen by me' means that it was not His. </p>

Vers. 31-33.  Et dixit, Quid dabo tibi? et dixit Jacob, Non dabis mihi quicquam, si facis mihi verbum hoc; revertar, pascam, gregem tuum custodiam.  Transibo per omnem gregem tuum hodie, removendo 
abinde omne pecus punctatum et maculosum, et omne pecus nigrum in agnis, et maculosum et punctatum in capris, et erit merces mea.  Et respondebit mihi justitia mea in die crastino, quia venis super 
mercedem meam coram te, omne quod non est illud punctatum et maculosum in capris, et nigrum in agnis, furatum illud cum me. `Dixit, Quid dabo tibi?' significat cognitionem: `et dixit Jacob' significat 
responsum: `Non dabis mihi quicquam, si facias mihi verbum hoc' significat quod ex parte boni quod ex vero adducetur: `revertar, pascam, gregem tuum custodiam' significat quod bonum per Labanem 
significatum adhibendum usui: `transibo per omnem gregem tuum hodie' significat quod percipit omne bonum quale est: `removendo abinde omne pecus punctatum et maculosum' significat quod separabitur 
omne bonum et verum quod ejus, cum quo mixtum malum quod est `punctatum, et cum quo mixtum falsum quod est `maculosum': `et omne pecus nigrum in agnis' significat proprium innocentiae, quod est 
boni per Labanem significati: `et maculosum et punctatum in capris' significat quod dein suum erit omne bonum veri, in quo mixtum falsum et malum: `et erit merces mea' significat quod a semet: `et 
respondebit mihi justitia mea' significat sanctitatem Divinam quae ipsi: `in die crastino' significat in aeternum: `quia venis super mercedem meam coram te' significat proprium ipsius: `omne quod 
non est illud punctatum et maculosum in capris' significat quod non ex bono per Labanem intellecto est mixtum malo et falso in veri bonis: `et nigrum in agnis' significat statum innocentiae primum: 
`furatum illud a me significat quod ipsius non esset. </p>
