<h3 align="center" class="ired">属天的奥秘 第2026节</h3>
<h4 align="center"></h4><p><strong>2026.</strong>“我要赐给你”表天上地下所存在的事物都是祂的。这从刚才所述可推知。从字面上看，“我要赐给你”表示神或耶和华要赐给主；就象福音书作者所写圣言说的那样，父将天上地下所有的权柄都赐给了祂。但就内义而言（内义中的真理本身就存在于它的纯洁中），这句话的意思是，主为自己获得它们，因为耶和华在祂里面，就在属于祂的一切事物中，如前所述。这一点可通过以下类比进一步来说明：这就像是内层人，或理性人，抑或思维要说，肉体若停止做这做那，就会找到平安和宁静。在这种情况下，说话的那一位和被说的那一位是同一个人，因为这理性和肉体都属于这个人。因此，提及前者时，也是在指后者。<br />而且，天上地下的事物都是主的。这一点从圣言中的很多经文清楚可知，如旧约和福音书（马太福音<a href="http://39-27.cn/太11.27.htm">11:27</a>；路加福音<a href="http://39-27.cn/路10.22.htm">10:22</a>；约翰福音<a href="http://39-27.cn/约3.34.htm">3:34</a>，<a href="http://39-27.cn/约3.35.htm">35</a>，<a href="http://39-27.cn/约17.2.htm">17:2</a>；马太福音<a href="http://39-27.cn/太28.18.htm">28:18</a>）；也可从第一卷的说明清楚看出来（<a href="458.htm">458</a>，<a href="551.htm">551</a>，<a href="552.htm">552</a>，<a href="1607.htm">1607</a>节）。主既统管整个天堂，也就统管地上万物；这二者已被如此联结起来，以致统管这一个的祂也统管万物。因为天使灵天堂依赖于天使天堂，灵人界依赖于天使灵天堂，而人类则依赖于灵人界。同样，尘世和自然界中的一切事物以同样的方式依赖于诸天堂，因为若没有主经由天堂的流注，自然界及其三个王国中没有一物能存在并维持存在（参看<a href="1632.htm">1632</a>节）。</p>

That by "I will give unto thee" is meant that the things which are in the heavens and on the earth are His, follows from what has just been said. In the sense of the letter, the words "I will give unto 
thee" mean that God or Jehovah would give to the Lord; just as it is said in the Word of the Evangelists that the Father gave unto Him all things that are in heaven and on the earth. But in the internal 
sense, in which the truth itself is presented in its purity, it means that the Lord acquired them for Himself, because Jehovah was in Him, and in everything belonging to Him, as before said. This 
may be further illustrated by that which is like it; for it is as if the interior or rational man, or the thought, should say that the corporeal would have rest or tranquillity if it would desist from 
doing this or that: in this case he that speaks is the same man as he that is spoken to, for both the rational and the corporeal belong to the man, and therefore when mention is made of the former, 
the latter also is understood.  [2] Moreover that the things in the heavens and on the earth are the Lord's, is evident from very many passages in the Word, both in the Old Testament, and also in the 
Evangelists (as Matt. 11:27; Luke 10:22; John 3:34, 35, 17:2; Matt. 28:18); and also from what has been shown in Part First (n. 458, 551, 552, 1607). And as the Lord rules the universal heaven, He also 
rules all things on earth; for they have been so connected together that He who rules the one rules all things; for on the heaven of angels depends the heaven of angelic spirits, on this the world 
of spirits, and on this again the human race. And in like manner on the heavens depend all things that are in the world and in nature, for without influx from the Lord through the heavens, nothing that 
is in nature and its three Kingdoms would come forth and endure (see n. 1632). </p>

That 'I will give to you' means that the things which exist in heaven and on earth are His follows from what has just been stated. In the sense of the letter 'giving to you' means that God or Jehovah 
would give to Him, as is also declared in the Word of the Gospel-writers about the Father giving all things in heaven and on earth to Him. But in the internal sense in which truth itself is presented 
in its purity, the meaning is that the Lord acquired it to Himself, because within Him and within every part of Him Jehovah was present, as has been stated. further light can be shed on this by the following 
analogy: It is as though the interior or rational man, or else thought, were to say that the bodily part of him would discover peace and quiet if it were to refrain from doing this or that. In 
this case the one who speaks is the same as the one spoken to, for the rational belongs to that person just as much as the bodily part. When therefore the former is spoken of the latter also is meant. </p>

Besides, the fact that things in heaven and on earth are the Lord's is clear from very many places in the Word, from many in the Old Testament as well as from the following in the Gospels, <a href="http://bible.gospelcom.net/cgi-bin/bible?passage=Matt%2011:27;%2028:18&amp;version=ESV&amp;interface=print&amp;showfn=yes&amp;showxref">Matt 11:27; 28:18</a>; <a href="http://bible.gospelcom.net/cgi-bin/bible?passage=Luke%2010:22&amp;version=ESV&amp;interface=print&amp;showfn=yes&amp;showxref">Luke 10:22</a>; <a href="http://bible.gospelcom.net/cgi-bin/bible?passage=John%203:34,%2035;%2017:2&amp;version=ESV&amp;interface=print&amp;showfn=yes&amp;showxref">John 3:34, 35; 17:2</a>, and from what has been shown in Volume One, in <a href="458.htm">458</a>, <a href="551.htm">551</a>, <a href="552.htm">552</a>, <a href="1607.htm">1607</a>. And because the Lord governs the whole of heaven He also governs everything on earth, 
for the two are so interconnected that whoever governs one governs all. For dependent on the heaven of angels is the heaven of angelic spirits; dependent on the heaven of angelic spirits is the 
world of spirits; and dependent in turn on the world of spirits is the human race. And dependent in like manner on the heavens is everything in the world and the natural order, for without influx from 
the Lord by way of the heavens nothing in the natural order and its three kingdoms can ever come into existence and remain in existence; see <a href="1632.htm">1632</a>. </p>

Quod `dabo tibi' sit quod Ipsius sint quae in caelis et in terris, ex illis quae nunc dicta sunt, sequitur; `dare tibi' in sensu litterae est quod Deus seu Jehovah Ipsi daret {1}, sicut etiam in Verbo 
evangelistarum, quod `Pater dederit ipsi omnia (o)quae in caelo et in terra'; sed in sensu interno in quo ipsum verum sistitur in sua puritate, est quod Dominus Sibi acquisiverit, quia {2} in Ipso 
et in singulis Ipsius fuit Jehovah, ut dictum est; quod per simile adhuc illustrari potest; sicut si interior seu rationalis homo aut cogitatio diceret, quod corporeum ejus haberet quietem seu tranquillitatem 
si desisteret hoc aut illud facere, tunc qui dicit est idem homo ac is ad quem dicitur, nam tam rationale est hominis quam corporeum {3}, quare cum illud dicitur, hoc intelligitur.  Praeterea 
quod Domini sint quae in caelis et in terris, constat ex plurimis locis Verbi, praeter ex illis quae in Veteri Testamento, etiam ex his apud evangelistas, Matth. xi 27; (o)xxviii 18; Luc. x 22; Joh. 
iii 34, 35; xvii 2; et ex illis quae in Parte Prima ostensa sunt n. 458, 551, 552, 1607; et quia Dominus regit universum caelum, etiam regit omnia quae in terris, ita enim connexa sunt ut qui unum regit, 
omnia regat; a caelo enim angelorum, dependet caelum spirituum angelicorum, ab hoc mundus spirituum, ab hoc iterum genus humanum, et similiter a caelis omnia quae sunt in mundo et natura, nam absque 
influxu a Domino per caelos, nihil usquam quod in natura et triplici ejus regno est, existeret et subsisteret; (o)videatur n. 1632. 	@1 dederit.$ 	@2 quippe.$ 	@3 i etiam.$ </p>
