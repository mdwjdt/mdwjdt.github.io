<h3 align="center" class="ired">属天的奥秘 第1164节</h3>
<h4 align="center"></h4><p><strong>1164.</strong>“古实”或埃塞俄比亚表人们借以确认谬念的对圣言的内在认知，这清楚可见于耶利米书：<br />埃及像尼罗河涨发，像江河的水翻腾。他说，我要涨发遮盖遍地，我要毁灭城邑和其中的居民。马匹上去吧！车辆急行吧！勇士，就是手拿盾牌的古实人和弗人，都出去吧！（耶利米书<a href="http://39-27.cn/耶46.8.htm">46:8</a>-<a href="http://39-27.cn/耶46.9.htm">9</a>）<br />“埃及”在此表那些若非通过知识理解，就不相信任何事物的人；结果，一切事物都被卷入怀疑、否认和虚假中，也就是“涨发遮盖遍地，毁灭城邑”所表示的。“古实人”在此表对圣言的更普遍、更内在的认知，他们借以确认已认可的谬念。“弗人”表从基于感官表象的圣言字义中汲取的认知。<br />以西结书：<br />必有刀剑临到埃及，在埃及被杀之人仆倒的时候，古实人就有痛苦，他们必掳掠她，她的根基必被拆毁。古实人、弗人、路德人、杂族的人民，并古巴人，以及同盟之地的人，都要与他们一同倒在刀下。（以西结书<a href="http://39-27.cn/结30.4.htm">30:4</a>-<a href="http://39-27.cn/结30.5.htm">5</a>）<br />若非藉着内义，没人知道这些话是什么意思。若这些名字不是指真实的事物，那么这几节经文毫无意义。然而，此处“埃及”表知识，他们渴望藉此进入信的奥秘。“古实人和弗人”被称为“她的根基”，是因为它们是取自圣言的认知。<br />同一先知书：<br />到那日，必有使者坐船从我面前出去，使安逸无虑的古实人惊惧，必有痛苦临到他们，好像埃及的日子一样。（以西结书<a href="http://39-27.cn/结30.9.htm">30:9</a>）<br />“古实人”表取自圣言的认知，它们确认知识所孵化出来的虚假。<br />同一先知书：<br />所以我必使埃及地从色弗尼塔直到古实境界，全然荒废凄凉。（以西结书<a href="http://39-27.cn/结29.10.htm">29:10</a>）<br />此处“埃及”表知识，“古实”表对圣言内在事物的认知，也就是知识所无法到达的“境界”。<br />以赛亚书：<br />亚述王也必照样把埃及的俘虏和古实的俘虏带走，无论老少，都露身赤脚，现出下体，使埃及蒙羞。以色列人必因所仰望的古实，所夸耀的埃及，惊惶羞愧。（以赛亚书<a href="http://39-27.cn/赛20.4.htm">20:4</a>，<a href="http://39-27.cn/赛20.5.htm">5</a>）<br />此处，“古实”表取自圣言的认知，经由知识所获得的虚假通过它们得以确认。“亚述王”是指带走俘虏的推理。<br />那鸿书：<br />古实和埃及是她无穷的力量，弗人和路比族是你的帮手。（那鸿书<a href="http://39-27.cn/鸿3.9.htm">3:9</a>）<br />这论及荒废的教会，“埃及”在此同样表知识，“古实”表认知。“古实和埃及”表简单的认知和知识，也就是有益于那些具有仁之信之人的真理。因此，“古实和埃及”也用来表示好的方面。以赛亚书：<br />耶和华如此说，埃及劳碌得来的和古实的货物必归你，身量高大的西巴人必都必过来归你，也要属你。他们必带着锁链过来随从你，又向你下拜，祈求你说，神真在你们中间，此外再没有别神！（以赛亚书<a href="http://39-27.cn/赛45.14.htm">45:14</a>）<br />“埃及劳碌”表知识，“古实的货物和西巴人”表对属灵事物的认知，它们有益于那些承认主的人，因为一切知识和一切认知都是他们的。<br />但以理书：<br />北方王必把持埃及的金银财宝和各样的宝物；吕彼亚人和古实人都必跟从他。（但以理书<a href="http://39-27.cn/但11.43.htm">11:43</a>）<br />“吕彼亚人和古实人”在此表取自圣言的认知，“埃及”表知识。西番雅书：<br />钦崇我的，必从古实河外来。（西番雅书<a href="http://39-27.cn/番3.10.htm">3:10</a>）<br />这表示那些超出认知范围之外的人，因而表外邦人。诗篇：<br />埃及的公侯要出来朝见神，古实人要急忙举手祷告。（诗篇<a href="http://39-27.cn/诗68.31.htm">68:31</a>）<br />“埃及”在此表知识，“古实”表认知。<br /><br />我要提起拉哈伯和巴比伦人，是在认识我之中的；看哪，非利士和推罗并古实人。后者生在那里（神之城）。（诗篇<a href="http://39-27.cn/诗87.4.htm">87:4</a>）<br />“古实”表取自圣言的认知，因此经上说他“生在神之城”。由于“古实”表对圣言的内在认知，以及由此获得的聪明，故经上说从伊甸园流出的第二道河“环绕古实全地”（对此，参看<a href="117.htm">117</a>节）。</p>

<p><strong>[NCE]1164.</strong> The symbolism of Cush (that is, Ethiopia) as the deeper knowledge in the Word that we use to confirm false assumptions, can be seen in Jeremiah:<br />Egypt rises like a river, and like rivers its waters churn. And it has said, "I will go up; I will blanket the land; I will destroy the city and those living in it." Go up, horses, and run mad, chariots, and let your mighty men march out, Cush and Put, as you grasp your shield. (<a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_1164/bible_king-james-version_jeremiah_46_8-9" target=_top>Jeremiah 46:8-9</a>)<br />In this passage Egypt stands for those who believe nothing unless they can comprehend it in terms of the facts they know. This insistence renders everything doubtful, negative, and false, which is what going up, covering the land, and destroying the city is. Cush, here, stands for broader, deeper kinds of knowledge in the Word that we use for shoring up the false principles we have adopted. Put stands for knowledge from the literal level of the Word that accords with appearances presented to us by our senses.{*1} [2] In Ezekiel:<br />A sword will come into Egypt, and there will be agony in Cush, when the victim of stabbing falls in Egypt, and they seize its mob, and its foundations are destroyed — Cush and Put, and Lud, and all the Ereb and Chub.{*2} And the children of the land of the covenant with them will fall by the sword. (<a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_1164/bible_king-james-version_ezekiel_30_4-5" target=_top>Ezekiel 30:4-5</a>, <a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_1164/bible_king-james-version_ezekiel_30_6" target=_top>6</a>)<br />No one would ever know what this meant without the inner meaning; and if the names were not symbolic, it would make hardly any sense at all. Egypt, though, symbolizes facts here — facts that we want to use as a means of entry into religious mysteries. Cush and Put are called Egypt's foundations because they stand for knowledge gained from the Word.<br />[3] In the same author:<br />On that day, messengers will go out from before me in ships, to terrify confident Cush. And there will be agony upon them as in Egypt's day. (<a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_1164/bible_king-james-version_ezekiel_30_9" target=_top>Ezekiel 30:9</a>)<br />Cush stands for knowledge from the Word that we use in proof of falsities we have dreamed up out of various facts. In the same author:<br />I will turn the land of Egypt into wastelands, a ruinous wasteland, from the tower to Syene even as far as the border of Cush. (<a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_1164/bible_king-james-version_ezekiel_29_10" target=_top>Ezekiel 29:10</a>)<br />Egypt stands for factual knowledge in this verse; Cush stands for knowledge of the deeper import of the Word, which is the border to which factual knowledge extends.<br />[4] In Isaiah:<br />The monarch of Assyria will lead Egypt's captives and Cush's captives, young and old, naked and barefoot and with uncovered buttock — the nakedness of Egypt. And they will panic and be embarrassed on account of Cush, their hope, and of Egypt, their glory. (<a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_1164/bible_king-james-version_isaiah_20_4-5" target=_top>Isaiah 20:4-5</a>)<br />In this passage, Cush stands for knowledge from the Word used to support the falsities that factual knowledge has prompted us to adopt. Assyria is shallow reasoning, which leads us captive. In Nahum:<br />Cush was its strength, as was Egypt, and there was no end to them. Put and the Libyans were of help to you.{*3} (<a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_1164/bible_king-james-version_nahum_3_9" target=_top>Nahum 3:9</a>)<br />The subject here is the church when it has been devastated, and once again Egypt stands for secular knowledge, while Cush stands for religious knowledge.<br />[5] Cush and Egypt can stand simply for religious and secular knowledge — truth, that is, which is useful to people whose faith comes from charity. In other words, Cush and Egypt sometimes have a good meaning. In Isaiah:<br />Jehovah has said: "The labor of Egypt, and the wares of Cush and of Seba's inhabitants — sizable men — will pass over to you and will belong to you. They will walk after you in fetters. They will pass over, and to you they will bow down. To you they will pray: ‘Only among you does God exist, and there is no other god besides.'" (<a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_1164/bible_king-james-version_isaiah_45_14" target=_top>Isaiah 45:14</a>)<br />The labor of Egypt stands for learning; the wares of Cush and of Seba's inhabitants, for the knowledge of spiritual things; [both of] which serve those who acknowledge the Lord. These are the people who possess all learning and knowledge.<br />[6] In Daniel:<br />The monarch of the north will rule over the hidden treasures of gold and silver, and over all the desirable things of Egypt, and of the Libyans [Put],{*4} and of the Cushites, in your footsteps. (<a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_1164/bible_king-james-version_daniel_11_43" target=_top>Daniel 11:43</a>)<br />Put and Cush stand for knowledge from the Word, while Egypt stands for secular learning. In Zephaniah:<br />From the ford of Cush's rivers come my worshipers. (<a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_1164/bible_king-james-version_zephaniah_3_10" target=_top>Zephaniah 3:10</a>)<br />This stands for people who lack access to religious knowledge and so for non-Christians. In David:<br />Nobles will come from Egypt; Cush will quickly thrust its hands out to God. (<a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_1164/bible_king-james-version_psalms_68_31" target=_top>Psalms 68:31</a>)<br />Egypt stands for learning and Cush for religious knowledge.<br />[7] In the same author:<br />I will remember Rahab and Babylon as being among those who know me — yes, Philistia, and Tyre, along with Cush. This last was born there [in the city of God].{*5} (<a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_1164/bible_king-james-version_psalms_87_4" target=_top>Psalms 87:4</a>)<br />Cush stands for knowledge from the Word, which is why it is said to have been born in the city of God.<br />It is because Cush symbolizes knowledge buried deep in the Word and an intelligent understanding based on this knowledge that the second river issuing from the Garden of Eden circled the whole land of Cush. For more on this, see <a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_1164/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_117" target=_top>117</a> above.<br /><br /><strong>Footnotes:</strong><br />{*1} One place where Swedenborg explains what he means by such appearances is <a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_1164/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_1408#subsection-2-3" target=_top>1408:3</a>, where he offers as an example the impression that the Lord gets angry at, punishes, curses, and kills people. Another example occurs in <a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_1164/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_588" target=_top>588</a>, where Swedenborg says that we would be unable to comprehend the Lord's mercy unless we could compare it to our own experience of regret. [LHC]<br />{*2} The words "Ereb" and "Chub" here reflect transliterations in Swedenborg's Latin text from the Hebrew of this passage in Ezekiel: עֶרֶב (‘ereḇ) and כּוּב (kûḇ). Their meaning is obscure. Biblical scholars, commentators, and translators differ on which people or geographical area is meant: some render the first term as "Arabia," while others render it as the "mixed" or "mingled" people or "the mixture;" the second term is rendered "Chub," "Cub," or "Kub," and is variously and inconclusively explained. Swedenborg goes on to say in the next sentence of his commentary that if the names were not symbolic, this passage in Ezekiel "would make hardly any sense at all." [JSR]<br />{*3} "Its" and "you" refer to the city No-Amon (Thebes). [LHC]<br />{*4} This bracketed interpolation is Swedenborg's. [LHC]<br />{*5} This bracketed interpolation is Swedenborg's.

That by "Cush" or "Ethiopia" are signified the interior knowledges of the Word, by which such men confirm false principles, may be seen in Jeremiah: </p>
<p>     Egypt riseth up like a stream, whose waters 
toss themselves like the rivers, and he hath said, I will go up, I will cover the earth, I will destroy the city and the inhabitants thereof. Go up ye horses, and rage ye chariots; and let the mighty 
men go forth, Cush and Put that handle the shield (Jer. 46:8-9). "Egypt" here denotes those who believe nothing unless they apprehend it from memory-knowledges, whereby everything becomes involved in 
doubt, denial, and falsity, which is to "go up, cover the earth, and destroy the city." "Cush" here denotes more universal and more interior knowledges of the Word, whereby men confirm received principles 
of falsity. "Put" denotes knowledges from the literal sense of the Word which are according to the appearances of the senses.  [2] In Ezekiel: </p>
<p>     A sword shall come upon Egypt, and there shall 
be grief in Cush, when the slain shall fall in Egypt; and they shall take her multitude, and her foundations shall be destroyed. Cush, and Put, and Lud, and all Ereb and Cub, and the sons of the land 
of the covenant shall fall with them by the sword (Ezek. 30:4-5). No one could at all know what these things mean except from the internal sense; and if the names did not signify actual things [res], 
there would be scarcely any sense. But here by "Egypt" are signified memory-knowledges, whereby men desire to enter into the mysteries of faith. "Cush and Put" are called "the foundations thereof" 
because they signify knowledges from the Word.  [3] In the same: </p>
<p>     In that day shall messengers go forth from before Me in ships, to make confident Cush afraid; and there shall be grief upon them, 
as in the day of Egypt (Ezek. 30:9). "Cush" denotes those knowledges from the Word that confirm falsities which are hatched from memory-knowledges. In the same: </p>
<p>     I will make the land of Egypt 
into wastes, a waste of desolation, from the tower of Seveneh, even unto the border of Cush (Ezek. 29:10). Here "Egypt" denotes memory-knowledges; and "Cush" the knowledges of the interior things of 
the Word, which are the boundaries as far as memory-knowledges go.  [4] In Isaiah: </p>
<p>     The king of Assyria shall lead the captivity of Egypt and the captivity of Cush, boys and old men, naked and 
barefoot, and with buttocks uncovered, the nakedness of Egypt; and they shall be dismayed and ashamed because of Cush their hope, and of Egypt their glory (Isa. 20:4-5). "Cush" here denotes knowledges 
from the Word, whereby falsities acquired through memory-knowledges are confirmed; "Asshur" is reasoning which leads men "captive." In Nahum: </p>
<p>     Cush and Egypt were her strength, and there was no 
end; Put and Lubim were thy helpers (Nahum 3:9). This is said of the church vastated, and here in like manner "Egypt" denotes memory-knowledges, and "Cush" knowledges.  [5] "Cush and Egypt" here denote 
simply knowledges and memory-knowledges, which are truths, useful to those who are in the faith of charity; thus they are here used in a good sense. In Isaiah: </p>
<p>     Thus said Jehovah, The labor 
of Egypt, and the merchandise of Cush, and of the Sabeans, men of stature, shall pass over unto thee, and they shall be thine; they shall go after thee in fetters, they shall pass over and shall bow down 
unto thee; they shall pray unto thee; God is in thee only, and there is no other God besides (Isa. 45:14). "The labor of Egypt" denotes memory-knowledge; and "the merchandise of Cush and of the Sabeans," 
knowledges of spiritual things which are serviceable to those who acknowledge the Lord; for all memory-knowledge and knowledge are for them.  [6] In Daniel: </p>
<p>     The king of the north shall 
have dominion over the hidden stores of gold and silver, and over all the desirable things of Egypt; and the Lubim (Put) and Cushim shall be at thy steps (Dan. 11:43). "Put and Cush" here denote knowledges 
from the Word; and "Egypt," memory-knowledges. In Zephaniah: </p>
<p>     From the crossing of the rivers of Cush, My worshipers (Zeph. 3:10), denoting those who are without knowledges, that is, the 
Gentiles. In David: </p>
<p>     Great ones shall come out of Egypt; Cush shall hasten his hands unto God (Ps. 68:31). "Egypt" here denotes memory-knowledges and "Cush" knowledges.  [7] In the same: </p>
<p>    
 I will make mention of Rahab and Babylon as among them that know Me behold Philistia, and Tyre, with Cush; this one was born there (in the city of God) (Ps. 87:4). "Cush" denotes knowledges from the 
Word; and therefore it is said that he "was born in the city of God." It is because "Cush" signifies the interior knowledges of the Word and the intelligence thence derived, that it is said that the 
second river that went forth from the garden of Eden "encompassed the whole land of Cush" (concerning which see n. 117). </p>

<p align="center"><b>Elliott(1983-1999) 1164</b></p><p><b>1164.</b>
That 'Cush' or Ethiopia means interior cognitions of the Word by which people confirm false assumptions is clear in Jeremiah, </p>
<blockquote>
Egypt comes up like the river, and like the rivers the waters are tossed 
about; and he said, I will go up, I will cover the earth, I will destroy the city and those who dwell in it. Go up, O horses, and rage, O chariots, and let the mighty men go forth, Cush and Put that 
handle the shield. <a href="http://bible.gospelcom.net/cgi-bin/bible?passage=Jer%2046:8,%209&amp;version=ESV&amp;interface=print&amp;showfn=yes&amp;showxref">Jer 46:8, 9</a>. 
</blockquote>
<p>In this case 'Egypt' stands for people who believe nothing they do not grasp through facts. As a result everything is subject to doubt, denial and falsification, 
meant by 'rising up, covering the earth, and destroying the city'. Here 'Cush' stands for the more universal and interior cognitions of the Word by which they confirm accepted false assumptions. 'Put' 
stands for cognitions drawn from the literal sense of the Word which are based on sensory appearances. </p>
<p></p>
<p><b>[2]</b>
 In Ezekiel, </p>
<blockquote>
A sword will come upon Egypt, and there will be grief in Cush when the slain<A name="fntext1"></a><A href="#fn1"><sup>a</sup></a> 
falls in Egypt; and they will take her multitude, and her foundations will be destroyed. Cush and Put and Lud and all of Ereb<A name="fntext2"></a><A href="#fn2"><sup>b</sup></a> and Kub, and the sons of the land of the covenant will fall with them 
by the sword. <a href="http://bible.gospelcom.net/cgi-bin/bible?passage=Ezek%2030:4-6&amp;version=ESV&amp;interface=print&amp;showfn=yes&amp;showxref">Ezek 30:4-6</a>. 
</blockquote>
<p>Except from the internal sense nobody could possibly know what these statements mean. And if the names did not mean real things, these verses would have practically no 
meaning at all. In this case however 'Egypt' means the knowledge by means of which they wish to enter into the mysteries of faith. 'Cush and Put' are called 'her foundations' because they are cognitions 
drawn from the Word. </p>
<p></p>
<p><b>[3]</b>
 In the same prophet, </p>
<blockquote>
On that day messengers will go forth from before Me in ships to terrify overconfident Cush, and there will be grief among them as in the day of 
Egypt. <a href="http://bible.gospelcom.net/cgi-bin/bible?passage=Ezek%2030:9&amp;version=ESV&amp;interface=print&amp;showfn=yes&amp;showxref">Ezek 30:9</a>. 
</blockquote>
<p>'Cush' stands for cognitions drawn from the Word which confirm falsities hatched out of facts. In the same prophet, </p>
<blockquote>
I will make the land of Egypt into waste places, an utter desolation, 
from the tower of Seveneh as far as the border of Cush. <a href="http://bible.gospelcom.net/cgi-bin/bible?passage=Ezek%2029:10&amp;version=ESV&amp;interface=print&amp;showfn=yes&amp;showxref">Ezek 29:10</a>. 
</blockquote>
<p>In this case 'Egypt' stands for facts, 'Cush' for cognitions of the interior things of the Word, which are 'the borders' 
beyond which knowledge does not go. </p>
<p></p>
<p><b>[4]</b>
 In Isaiah, </p>
<blockquote>
The king of Asshur will lead away the captives of Egypt and the captives of Cush, boys and old men, naked and barefoot, and with buttocks uncovered, 
the nakedness of Egypt. And they will be dismayed and ashamed because of Cush their hope, and because of Egypt their glory. <a href="http://bible.gospelcom.net/cgi-bin/bible?passage=Isa%2020:4,%205&amp;version=ESV&amp;interface=print&amp;showfn=yes&amp;showxref">Isa 20:4, 5</a>. 
</blockquote>
<p>Here 'Cush' stands for cognitions drawn from the 
Word by which falsities obtained through facts are confirmed. 'Asshur' is reasoning which carries away those who are captive. In Nahum, </p>
<blockquote>
Cush was her strength, Egypt too, and that without limit; Put 
and the Libyans were your help. <a href="http://bible.gospelcom.net/cgi-bin/bible?passage=Nahum%203:9&amp;version=ESV&amp;interface=print&amp;showfn=yes&amp;showxref">Nahum 3:9</a>. 
</blockquote>
<p>This refers to a vastated Church where in a similar way 'Egypt' stands for facts and 'Cush' for cognitions. </p>
<p></p>
<p><b>[5]</b>
 'Cush' and 'Egypt' stand simply for cognitions 
and knowledge which are truths useful to people whose faith is grounded in charity. 'Cush and Egypt' is used in this good sense in Isaiah, </p>
<blockquote>
Jehovah said, The labour of Egypt, and the wares 
of Cush and of the Sabeans, men of stature, will come over to you and will be yours. They will follow after you in fetters, they will come over and bow down to you. To you they will make the supplication, 
God is with you only, and there is no other besides God. <a href="http://bible.gospelcom.net/cgi-bin/bible?passage=Isa%2045:14&amp;version=ESV&amp;interface=print&amp;showfn=yes&amp;showxref">Isa 45:14</a>. 
</blockquote>
<p>'The labour of Egypt' stands for knowledge, 'the wares of Cush and the Sabeans' for cognitions of spiritual things which serve 
those who acknowledge the Lord, for all knowledge and every cognition are theirs. </p>
<p></p>
<p><b>[6]</b>
 In Daniel, </p>
<blockquote>
The king of the north will have dominion over the secret hoards of gold and silver, and over 
all the precious things of Egypt; and the Libyans (Put) and the Cushites will follow in his<A name="fntext3"></a><A href="#fn3"><sup>c</sup></a> steps. <a href="http://bible.gospelcom.net/cgi-bin/bible?passage=Dan%2011:3&amp;version=ESV&amp;interface=print&amp;showfn=yes&amp;showxref">Dan 11:3</a>. 
</blockquote>
<p>'Put and Cush' here stands for cognitions drawn from the Word, 'Egypt' for facts. In 
Zephaniah, </p>
<blockquote>
From beyond the rivers of Cush are those who adore Me. <a href="http://bible.gospelcom.net/cgi-bin/bible?passage=Zeph%203:10&amp;version=ESV&amp;interface=print&amp;showfn=yes&amp;showxref">Zeph 3:10</a>. 
</blockquote>
<p>This stands for those who are beyond the range of cognitions, and so for gentiles. In David, </p>
<blockquote>
Noblemen will come 
out of Egypt, Cush will hasten [to stretch out] her hands to God. <a href="http://bible.gospelcom.net/cgi-bin/bible?passage=Ps%2068:31&amp;version=ESV&amp;interface=print&amp;showfn=yes&amp;showxref">Ps 68:31</a>. 
</blockquote>
<p>Here 'Egypt' stands for knowledge, and 'Cush' for cognitions.  </p>

I will mention Rahab and Babel 
among those who know Me; behold, Philistia and Tyre, with Cush. The latter was born here (in the city of God). <a href="http://bible.gospelcom.net/cgi-bin/bible?passage=Ps%2087:4&amp;version=ESV&amp;interface=print&amp;showfn=yes&amp;showxref">Ps 87:4</a>.

<p>'Cush' stands for cognitions drawn from the Word, hence the statement that 
he was 'born in the city of God'. Since 'Cush' means interior cognitions of the Word and intelligence acquired from these, it is therefore said that the second river going out of the garden of Eden 
encompassed the whole land of Cush. On this see what has appeared already in <a href="117.htm">117</a>.

Quod per 'Cush seu Aethiopiam' significentur cognitione interiores Verbi per quas confirmant principia falsa, constat apud Jeremiam,  Aegyptus sicut flumen ascendit, et sicut flumina commoventur  aquae, 
et dixit, Ascendam, obtegam terram; perdam civitatem, et habitantes in ea. Ascendite equi, et insanite currus, et egrediantur fortes; Cush et Put, apprehendentes scutum, xlvi 8, 9; </p>
<p>hic 'Aegyptus' 
pro iis qui nihil credunt nisi ex scientificis illa capiant, inde omnia dubitativa, negativa et falsa, quod est 'ascendere, obtegere terram, et perdere civitatem':  'Cush' ibi pro cognitionibus universalioribus 
et interioribus Verbi quibus capta principia falsi confirmant; 'Put' pro cognitionibus ex sensu litterali Verbi quae sunt secundum sensuum apparentias:  [2] apud Ezechielem, Veniet gladius 
in Aegyptum, et erit dolor in Cush, cum cadet confossus in Aegypto; et accipient turbam ejus, et destruentur fundamenta ejus; Cush et Put, et Lud, et tota {1}Ereb et Kub, et filii terrae foederis 
cum iis gladio cadent, xxx 4-6;    haec nusquam aliquis sciret quid esset, nisi ex sensu interno; et nisi nomina significarent res, paene nullus sensus foret; sed hic per 'Aegyptum' significantur scientiae 
per quas intrare volunt in mysteria fidei; 'Cush et Put' vocantur fundamenta ejus, quia sunt cognitiones ex Verbo:  [3]apud eundem,  In die illo exibunt nuntii a coram Me in navibus ad terrendum 
Cush confidentem, et erit dolor in iis juxta diem Aegypti, xxx 9; </p>
<p>'Cush' pro cognitionibus ex Verbo confirmantibus falsa ex scientificis exclusa:  apud eundem,  Dabo terram Aegypti in vastitates, 
vastitatem desolationis a turri Sevene, et usque ad terminum Cush, xxix 10; </p>
<p>ibi 'Aegyptus' pro scientificis, 'Cush' pro cognitionibus interiorum Verbi, quae sunt 'termini' quousque vadunt scientiae: 
 [4]apud Esaiam,  Ducet rex Asshuris captivitatem Aegypti, et captivitatem Cushi, pueros et senes, nudum et discalceatum, et detectos nate, nuditatem Aegypti; et consternabuntur et erubescent ob Cushum 
spem eorum, et ob Aegyptum decus eorum, xx 4, 5;  ibi 'Cush' pro cognitionibus ex Verbo quibus confirmantur falsa per scientifica capta; 'Asshur' est ratiocinatio quae 'captivos ducit':  apud Nahum, Cush 
fortitudo ejus et Aegyptus, et non finis; Put et Lubim fuerunt in auxilio tuo, iii 9; </p>
<p>de Ecclesia vastata, ubi similiter 'Aegyptus' pro scientificis et 'Cush' pro cognitionibus.  [5]'Cush 
et Aegyptus' simpliciter pro cognitionibus et scientiis, quae sunt veritates utiles illis qui sunt in fide charitatis; ita in bono sensu; apud Esaiam, Dixit Jehovah, Labor Aegypti, et merces Cushi, et 
Sabaeorum, viri mensurae, ad te transibunt, et tibi erunt; post te ibunt in compedibus, transibunt, et ad te incurvabunt se, ad te orabunt, Tantummodo in te Deus, et non praeterea alius Deus, xlv 14; </p>
<p>'labor 
Aegypti' pro scientia, 'merces Cushi et Sabaeorum' pro cognitionibus spiritualium quae illis inserviunt qui agnoscunt Dominum, [6]nam eis omnis scientia et cognitio:  apud Danielem, Rex septentrionis 
dominabitur in recondita auri et argenti, et in omnia desiderabilia Aegypti; et Lubim (Put) et Cushim, in incessibus tuis, xi 43; </p>
<p>'Put et Cush' ibi pro cognitionibus ex Verbo, 'Aegyptus' 
pro scientificis:  apud Zephaniam, A transitu fluviorum Cushi adoratores Mei, iii 10; </p>
<p>pro illis qui extra cognitiones, ita pro gentibus:  apud Davidem,  Venient magnates ex Aegypto, Cush accelerabit 
manus suas Deo, Ps. lxviii 32 [A.V. 31]; </p>
<p>[7] hic 'Aegyptus' pro scientiis, et 'Cush' pro cognitionibus:  apud eundem,  Memorabo Rahabam et Babel inter cognoscentes Me; ecce Philistaea et Tyrus cum 
Cusho; hic natus est ibi, (in civitate Dei), Ps. lxxxvii 4; </p>
<p>'Cush' pro cognitionibus ex Verbo, quare dicitur 'natus in civitate Dei.'  Quia 'Cush' significat cognitiones interiores Verbi, et intelligentiam 
inde, ideo dicitur, quod fluvius secundus exiens ex horto Edenis circumdederit totam terram Cush, de quo videatur prius n. 117. @1 'Ereb' does not seem to be a place name, but the Heb.='strangers, 
aliens'  Ges. suggests 'auxiliary forces,' A.V. has 'mingled people.'$ </p>
