From what has been thus far said it can be seen how the case is with man and his life, namely, that man is such as his will is, and that he remains such after death, because death is not the end of life, 
but its continuation. As therefore man is such as his will is, because, as before said, the will is the man himself, therefore "to be judged according to his deeds" signifies to be judged according 
to his will, for will and deed are not at variance, the deed being in the will and the will in the deed, provided external bonds do not hinder, such as fears of the law, of the loss of honor, of gain, 
of reputation, and of life. This is circumstanced like endeavor and motion. Motion is nothing else than continuous endeavor; for when endeavor ceases, motion ceases, and therefore there is nothing 
essential in motion except endeavor. The learned know this, for it is an acknowledged and confirmed theorem. Endeavor in man is will, and motion in him is action; they are so called in man because in 
him endeavor and motion are living. To be judged according to the will is the same thing as to be judged according to the love, and also the same as to be judged according to the ends of life, likewise 
to be judged according to the life, for the will of man is his love, and is his end of life, and is his very life itself. That this is the case is evident from the words of the Lord quoted above, that 
"whoever looketh on a strange woman to lust after her hath committed adultery with her already in his heart" (Matt. 5:27, 28); also that "to kill" a man is not only to do so in act, but also to will 
to do it, which is signified by "being angry" with him and treating him with insult (Matt. 5:21). Moreover man is judged according to his deeds, but no further than insofar and in such a manner as 
his deeds have proceeded from his will. </p>

The things that have been stated so far show what the situation is with a person and his life. That is to say, they show that a person is such as his will is, and that he remains such after death since 
death is not the end to life but the continuation of it. Since therefore a person is such as his will is - because, as has been stated above, the will is the real person - being judged according to 
one's deeds means being judged according to one's will, since there is no disparity between will and deed. Though external restraints exist - fear of the law, and fear of the loss of position, gain, 
reputation, or life - to inhibit the deed, the deed is all along in the will, and the will all along in the deed. It is like endeavour and motion. Motion is nothing other than an extension of the endeavour; 
for as endeavour comes to an end, so does motion. Therefore there is nothing essential within motion apart from endeavour. Learned people know this, for it is a recognized and well-established 
idea. In the human being endeavour is the will and motion is action; and they are called such in the human being because in him endeavour and motion are living. Being judged according to one's will is 
the same as being judged according to one's love; it is also the same as being judged according to the ends one has in view in life, as well as being judged according to the way one lives. For a person's 
will is his love, it is the end he has in view in life, and it is the very life itself within him. The truth of this is clear from the Lord's words which have already been quoted - One who looks 
at a woman

<h4>Notes</h4><small>
<a name="fn1"></a><a href="#fntext1"><sup>a</sup></a> in such a way that he lusts after her has already committed adultery with her in his heart. <a href="http://bible.gospelcom.net/cgi-bin/bible?passage=Matt%205:27,%2028&amp;version=ESV&amp;interface=print&amp;showfn=yes&amp;showxref">Matt 5:27, 28</a>. It is clear also from His saying that killing someone is not only performing that 
deed but also the desire to perform it, which is meant by being angry and reviling him with insults, <a href="http://bible.gospelcom.net/cgi-bin/bible?passage=Matt%205:21,%2022&amp;version=ESV&amp;interface=print&amp;showfn=yes&amp;showxref">Matt 5:21, 22</a>. Furthermore a person is indeed judged according to his deeds; yet no further questions 
are asked than these - How far did those deeds spring from his will? and What nature did his will give them? </p>

{1} Ex his quae hactenus dicta sunt, constare potest quomodo se habet cum homine et ejus vita, quod nempe homo talis sit qualis ejus voluntas, et quod talis post mortem permaneat, quia mors non est 
finis vitae sed continuatio ejus; cum itaque homo talis est, qualis est ejus voluntas, quia, ut supra dictum est, voluntas est ipse homo, idcirco judicari secundum facta significat judicari secundum voluntatem, 
nam voluntas et factum non discrepant; sunt modo externa vincula, quae sunt timores legis, jacturae honoris, lucri, famae, vitae, quae inhibent; interea in voluntate est factum, et in facto 
est voluntas; se habet hoc sicut conatus et motus, motus non est nisi quam continuus conatus, nam cessante conatu cessat motus, quare nihil essentiale in motu est conatus; hoc sciunt eruditi, nam est 
theorema agnitum et confirmatum; conatus in homine est voluntas, et motus in illo est actio, ita vocantur in homine, quia in illo conatus et motus vivi sunt; (x)judicari secundum voluntatem idem est 
ac judicari secundum amorem, ac quoque idem ac judicari secundum fines vitae, tum judicari secundum vitam, nam voluntas hominis est ejus amor, et est ejus finis vitae, estque ipsissima vita; quod ita 
sit, constat a Domini verbis prius citatis, quod 	Qui aspicit mulierem alienam ita ut concupiscat (x)eam, jam adulterium commiserit cum illa in corde suo, Matth. v 27, 28; </p>
<p>tum quod `occidere hominem' 
non solum sit ita facere, sed etiam velle id facere, quod significatur per `irasci et per contumeliis illum afficere,' Matth. v 21; judicatur etiam homo secundum facta, sed non ultra quam quantum et 
qualiter facta ex voluntate ejus processerunt. @1 A differs considerably from I and is therefore given fully here: (s)Ex his quae hactenus dicta sunt constare potest, quomodo se habet cum homine et 
ejus vita, quod nempe homo talis sit qualis ejus voluntas, et quod talis post mortem maneat, quia mors est continuatio vitae: cum itaque homo talis sit qualis ejus voluntas, quia ut dictum est supra, 
ipse homo est sua voluntas, idcirco judicari secundum facta sua, significat judicari secundum voluntatem suam, nam ubi voluntas ibi etiam est factum, sunt modo vincula externa, quae sunt timor legis, 
jacturae famae, honoris, lucri et vitae, quae faciunt ut non appareant in mundo, et praeterea factum non est nisi quam voluntas, nam nihil essentiale est in facto quam voluntas, (m)se habet hoc sicut 
conatus et motus, motus non est nisi quam continuus conatus, nam cessante conatu cessat motus, quare nihil essentiale in motu est quam conatus, hoc sciunt eruditi, nam est illis hoc axioma [theorema written 
first] agnitum et confirmatum; conatus in homine est voluntas, et motus in illo est actio ita vocantur in homine quia in illo conatus et motus vivi sunt:(n) judicari secundum voluntatem idem est 
ac judicari secundum amorem, et quoque idem est ac indicari secundum fines vitae, imo est idem ac judicari secundum vitam, nam quod vult homo hoc amat et hoc pro fine vitae habet; et inde finis seu 
intentio est ipsa vita in omni facto: quod ita sit, constat a Domini verbis prius citatis, quod qui aspicit mulierem alienam ita ut concupiscat illam, jam adulterium commiserit cum illa in corde suo, 
Matth. v 27, 28, quod concupiscere sit velle facere, ita facere, videatur supra; praeter etiam alibi, ubi Dominus docet, quod occidere hominem, non solum sit ita facere sed etiam velle id facere, quod 
significatur per irasci ei, et contumeli illum afficere, Matth. v 21, judicatur etiam homo secundum facta, sed non ultra quam quantum et qualiter facta ex voluntate ejus processerunt.(s)$ </p>
