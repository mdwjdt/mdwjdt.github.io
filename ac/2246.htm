<h3 align="center" class="ired">属天的奥秘 第2246节</h3>
<h4 align="center"></h4><p><strong>2246.</strong>“向所多玛去”表关于沉浸在这种大恶中的人类。这从“所多玛”的含义清楚可知，“所多玛”是指源于自我之爱的邪恶（参看<a href="2220.htm">2220</a>节）；而“面向所多玛观看”是指面对人类的状态（<a href="2219.htm">2219</a>节）。“所多玛”表示沉浸于这种大恶中的人类状态，其原因在于，“所多玛”并非指所多玛，而是指全世界所有那些被自我之爱所主宰的人；并且对所多玛的描述就代表凡沉浸于那恶之人的状态，这从下文明显可知。自我之爱是一切邪恶的源头，因而是邪恶本身的源头，这从前面的阐述和说明清楚可知（<a href="2045.htm">2045</a>，<a href="2057.htm">2057</a>，<a href="2219.htm">2219</a>节）。这就是为何此处说他们沉浸于这种大恶中。</p>

They went toward Sodom. That this signifies thought concerning the human race as being in such great evil, is evident from the signification of "Sodom," as being evil from the love of self (see above, 
n. 2220); and of "looking forth toward the faces of Sodom," as being toward the state of the human race (n. 2219). That "Sodom" signifies the state of the human race as being in such great evil, is 
because by "Sodom" is not meant Sodom, but all those in the universal world who are in the love of self; and by the description of Sodom is represented the state of all who are in that evil, as is evident 
from what follows. That the love of self is the fountain of all evils, thus evil itself, is evident from what was said and shown of it before (n. 2045, 2057, 2219), and therefore it is here said 
that they were in such great evil. </p>

<p align="center"><b>Elliott(1983-1999) 2246</b></p><p><b>2246.</b>
'They went towards Sodom' means concerning the human race which was immersed in such great evil. This is clear from the meaning of 'Sodom' as evil that stems from self-love, dealt with above in <a href="2220.htm">2220</a>, 
and of 'looking towards the face of Sodom' as towards the state of the human race, <a href="2219.htm">2219</a>. The reason 'Sodom' means the state of the human race which was immersed in such great evil is that Sodom is not 
used to mean Sodom but all those throughout the world who are governed by self-love; and the description of Sodom represents the state of all who are immersed in that evil, as becomes clear from what 
follows. The fact that self-love is the source of all evils, and so of evil itself, is clear from what has been stated and shown about it already in <a href="2045.htm">2045</a>, <a href="2057.htm">2057</a>, <a href="2219.htm">2219</a>. This is why it is said here that 
they were immersed in such great evil. </p>

`Iverunt versus Sodomam': quod significet de {1} humano genere quod in tanto malo, constat (c)a significatione `Sodomae' quod sit malum ex amore sui, de qua supra n. 2220, et `prospicere ad facies Sodomae' 
quod sit ad statum `generis humani', n. 2219; quod `Sodoma' significet statum humani generis quod in tanto malo, inde est quia per `Sodomam' non intelligitur Sodoma sed omnes illi in universa 
terrarum orbe qui sunt in amore sui, et per descriptionem Sodomae repraesentatur status omnium qui in illo malo sunt, ut a sequentibus constare potest: quod amor sui sit omnium malorum fons, ita ipsum 
malum, constat ab (c)illis quae de illo prius n. 2045, 2057, 2219 dicta et ostensa sunt; quare hic dicitur quod in tanto malo. 	@1 humanum genus AI but see 2244.$ </p>
