<h3 align="center" class="ired">属天的奥秘 第3720节</h3>
<h4 align="center"></h4><p><strong>3720.</strong>“这不是别的，乃是神的家”表处于次序最终层级的主国度。这从“神的家”的含义清楚可知。在圣言中，许多经文都提到了“神的家”（house of God）。从外在意义，也就是字义上看，它表示举行神圣敬拜的建筑物；但从内义上看，它表示教会；从更普遍的意义上看，表示天堂；从最普遍的意义上看，表示主的国度；而从至内在的意义上看，它表示主自己的神性人身。在圣言中，我们有时读到“神的家”，有时读到“殿”。这二者意义差不多，不同之处在于，当论述良善时，经上就用“神的家”这个词；当论述真理时，经上则用“殿”这个词。由此明显可知，“神的家”表示主的属天教会；在更普遍的意义上表示属天天使的天堂；在最普遍的意义上表示主的属天国度；在至高意义上则表示主的神性良善。而“殿”表示主的属灵教会；在更普遍的意义上表示属灵天使的天堂；在最普遍的意义上表示主的属灵国度；在至高意义上则表示主的神性真理（参看<a href="2048.htm">2048</a>节）。之所以“神的家”表示属天之物和良善的居所，而“殿”表示属灵之物和真理的居所，是因为在圣言中，“家”表示良善（<a href="710.htm">710</a>，<a href="2233.htm">2233</a>，<a href="2559.htm">2559</a>，<a href="3128.htm">3128</a>，<a href="3652.htm">3652</a>节），并且在上古之人当中，家是用木头建造的，“木”就表示良善（<a href="643.htm">643</a>，<a href="1110.htm">1110</a>，<a href="2784.htm">2784</a>，<a href="2812.htm">2812</a>节）；而“殿”之所以表示真理，是因为殿是用石头建造的，而“石”表示真理（<a href="643.htm">643</a>，<a href="1296.htm">1296</a>，<a href="1298.htm">1298</a>节）。<br />“木”和“石”具有这些含义不仅从提及它们的圣言，还从来世的代表明显看出来。因为将功德置于善行之人觉得自己在砍柴；而将功德置于真理，以为自己知道的真理比别人多，却生活邪恶之人则觉得自己在劈石头。我常常看到这种人在砍柴或劈石，“木”和“石”的含义由此清楚向我显明，即“木”表良善，“石”表真理。它们的含义同样从以下经历向我清楚显明：一看见木头房子，良善的概念便呈现出来；而一看见石头房子，真理的概念便呈现出来。对此，我还从天使那里得到指教。由于这个原因，在圣言中，当提及“神的家”时，良善的概念便呈现给天使，这良善的种类取决于正在论述的主题的性质。当提及“殿”时，真理的概念便呈现出来，这真理的种类取决于正在论述的主题。由此可推知，圣言中的属天奥秘何等之深，并且隐藏得何等严实。<br />“神的家”之所以在此表示处于次序最终层级的主国度，是因为所论述的主题是雅各，而雅各代表主的神圣属世层，这在前面已频繁说明。属世层处于次序的最终层级，因为属世层包含一切内在层级，并将它们全都囊括在内。由于它们全都被囊括在属世层里面，因而无数事物被视为一个整体，故相对于其它层级，属世层存在模糊。这种相对模糊在前面也已频繁说明。</p>

This is none other than the house of God. That this signifies the Lord's kingdom in the ultimate of order, is evident from the signification of the "house of God." Mention is made of the "house of God" 
in many passages of the Word, and in the external sense, or according to the letter, it signifies a consecrated building where there is holy worship; but in the internal sense it signifies the church; 
and in a more universal sense, heaven; and in the most universal sense, the Lord's universal kingdom; in the supreme sense, however, it signifies the Lord Himself as to the Divine Human. In the Word 
we sometimes read of the "house of God," sometimes of the "temple," both having the same signification, but with this difference-that the "house of God" is mentioned where good is treated of; but the 
"temple" where truth is treated of. From this it is manifest that by the "house of God" is signified the Lord's celestial church, and in a more universal sense the heaven of the celestial angels, and 
in the most universal sense the Lord's celestial kingdom, and in the supreme sense the Lord as to Divine good; and that by the "temple" is signified the Lord's spiritual church, and in a more universal 
sense the heaven of the spiritual angels, in the most universal sense the Lord's spiritual kingdom, and in the supreme sense the Lord as to Divine truth (see n. 2048). The reason why the "house of 
God" signifies the celestial which is of good, and the "temple" the spiritual which is of truth, is that in the Word a "house" signifies good (n. 710, 2233, 2234, 2559, 3128, 3652), and also because 
among the most ancient people the houses were constructed of wood, for the reason that "wood" signifies good (n. 643, 1110, 2784, 2812); whereas "temple" signifies truth, because the temples were constructed 
of stones; and that "stones" signify truths, may be seen above (n. 643, 1296, 1298).  [2] That "wood" and "stone" have such a signification, is not only evident from the Word where they are 
mentioned, but also from the representatives in the other life; for they who place merit in good works, appear to themselves to cut wood; and they who place merit in truths, in that they have believed 
themselves to have been better acquainted with truth than others, and yet have lived evilly, appear to themselves to cut stones; which things have often been seen by me. From this I was assured what 
is the signification of wood and stone, namely that "wood" signifies good, and "stone" truth; and also from the experience that when a wooden house was seen, there was instantly presented an idea of good; 
but when a house of stone was seen, there was presented an idea of truth; concerning which I was instructed by angels. For this reason, when mention is made in the Word of the "house of God," there 
is presented to the angels the idea of good, and good of such a quality as is treated of in that connection; and when mention is made of a "temple," there is presented to them the idea of truth, and 
truth of such a quality as is treated of in that connection. From this again we can infer how deep and utterly hidden are the heavenly arcana in the Word. [3] The reason why by the "house of God" is 
here signified the Lord's kingdom in the ultimate of order, is that Jacob is treated of, by whom is represented the Lord's Divine natural, as frequently shown above. The natural is in the ultimate of 
order, for in this all the interior things are terminated and are together; and because they are together, and thus things innumerable are viewed together as a one, there is relative obscurity there. 
This relative obscurity has been spoken of several times before. </p>

<p align="center"><b>Elliott(1983-1999) 3720</b></p><p><b>3720.</b>
'This is nothing other than the house of God' means the Lord's kingdom as it exists in the ultimate degree of order. This is clear from the meaning of 'the house of God'. In the Word 'the house of God' 
is referred to in many places, and in the external sense, that is, literally, it means a building where holy worship takes place. But in the internal sense it means the Church, in the more universal 
sense it means heaven, and in the most universal the Lord's kingdom. In the highest sense however it means the Lord Himself as regards the Divine Human. But in the Word sometimes the expression 'House 
of God' is used and sometimes 'Temple'. The two are similar in meaning, the difference being that the expression 'House of God' is used when the subject is good but 'temple' when the subject is truth. 
From this it is evident that 'the House of God' means the Lord's celestial Church, and in the more universal sense the heaven of celestial angels, in the most universal the Lord's celestial kingdom, 
and in the highest sense the Lord as regards Divine Good; whereas 'the Temple' means the Lord's spiritual Church, and in the more universal sense the heaven of spiritual angels, in the most universal 
the Lord's spiritual kingdom, and in the highest the Lord as regards Divine Truth, see <a href="2048.htm">2048</a>. The reason why 'the House of God' means that which is celestial and the dwelling-place of good, while 'the 
Temple' means that which is spiritual and the dwelling-place of truth, is that 'a house' in the Word means good, see <a href="710.htm">710</a>, <a href="2233.htm">2233</a>, <a href="2559.htm">2559</a>, <a href="3128.htm">3128</a>, <a href="3652.htm">3652</a>, and among the most ancient people used to be built 
of pieces of wood for the reason that 'wood' meant good, <a href="643.htm">643</a>,<a href="1110.htm">1110</a>, <a href="2784.htm">2784</a>, <a href="2812.htm">2812</a>, whereas 'the Temple' means truth because it was built of stones - 'stones' meaning truths, see <a href="643.htm">643</a>,<a href="1296.htm">1296</a>,<a href="1298.htm">1298</a>. </p>
<p></p>
<p><b>[2]</b>
 These 
meanings that 'pieces of wood' and 'stones' possess are clear not only from the Word where they are mentioned but also from representatives in the next life. For people who assume that merit lies in 
good works seem to themselves to be cutting wood, and those who assume that it lies in truths, that is to say, people who have believed that they knew more truths than anybody else and yet have lived 
wickedly, seem to themselves to be breaking up stones. I have often seen such people wood-cutting or stone-breaking, from which the meaning of 'wood' and of 'stone' was made clear to me - that good is 
meant by 'wood' and truth by 'stone'. It has in like manner been made clear to me from the fact that when I have seen a wooden house the concept of good has instantly presented itself, and when I have 
seen a stone house the concept of truth has done so. And I have also learned from angels about this matter. This is why, when in the Word 'the House of God' is mentioned, the concept of good presents 
itself to angels, the kind of good depending on the nature of the subject that is being dealt with. And when 'the Temple' is mentioned, the concept of truth presents itself, the kind of truth depending 
on the subject that is being dealt with. From this one may also deduce how deeply and inwardly concealed the heavenly arcana lie in the Word. </p>
<p></p>
<p><b>[3]</b>
 The reason 'the House of God' here means the Lord's 
kingdom as it exists in the ultimate degree of order is that the subject is Jacob who, as often shown already, represents the Lord's Divine Natural. The natural exists in the ultimate degree of 
order, for the natural encompasses all interior degrees and includes them all together within itself. And since they are included all together within the natural, and so countless things are beheld as 
a single whole, obscurity exists there compared with other degrees. This obscurity too has been dealt with frequently. </p>

`Nihil hic nisi domus Dei': quod significet regnum Domini in ultimo ordinis, constat ex significatione `Domus Dei': in Verbo multis in locis memoratur Domus Dei, et in sensu externo seu secundum 
litteram significat aedem ubi cultus sanctus, sed in sensu interno significat Ecclesiam, inque sensu universaliore caelum, ac in universalissimo universum regnum Domini; in supremo autem sensu Ipsum 
Dominum quoad Divinum Humanum; sed in Verbo nunc dicitur Domus Dei, nunc Templum; utrumque simile significat, sed cum differentia quod `Domus Dei' dicatur ubi agitur de bono, at `Templum' ubi de 
vero; inde patet quod per Domum Dei significetur Ecclesia Domini caelestis, inque universaliore sensu caelum angelorum caelestium, in universalissimo regnum caeleste Domini, ac in supremo sensu Dominus 
quoad Divinum Bonum; et quod per Templum significetur Ecclesia Domini spiritualis, inque universaliore sensu caelum angelorum spiritualium, in universalissimo regnum spirituale Domini, ac in supremo 
Dominus quoad Divinum Verum, videatur n. 2048. Quod `Domus Dei' significet caeleste quod boni, et quod `Templum' spirituale quod veri, est inde quia `domus' in Verbo significat bonum, videatur 
n. 710, 2233, {1}2559, 3128, 3652, et quia construebatur ex lignis apud antiquissimos, ex causa quia `lignum' significabat bonum, n. 643, 1110, 2784, 2812; `Templum' autem significat verum quia 
construebatur ex lapidibus; quod `lapides' sint vera, videatur n. 643, 1296, 1298: [2] quod ligna et lapides talia significent, non {2}modo constat ex Verbo ubi nominantur, sed etiam ex repraesentativis 
in altera vita; qui enim meritum in bonis operibus  ponunt, illa apparent sibi scindere ligna; et qui meritum in veris ponunt, quod nempe crediderint se vera prae aliis novisse, et tamen male 
vixerunt, apparent sibi scindere lapides; quae saepius mihi visa sunt; inde mihi constare potuit quid significatio ligni {3}et lapidis, nempe quod ligni sit bonum, et lapidis sit verum; pariter ex 
eo quod quando visa mihi domus lignea, ilico obvenerit idea boni, et cum visa domus lapidea, obvenerit idea veri; de qua re etiam ab angelis instructus sum: </p>
<p>inde est cum in Verbo memoratur Domus Dei, 
angelis obveniat idea boni, et talis boni de {4}quali in serie agitur; et cum memoratur Templum, quod obveniat idea veri, et talis veri de {4}quali in serie agitur. Inde quoque {5}concludi potest, 
quam alte et penitus recondita{6} sunt arcana caelestia in Verbo. [3] Quod per `Domum Dei' hic significetur regnum Domini in ultimo ordinis, est quia agitur de Jacobo, per quem quod repraesentetur 
Divinum Naturale Domini, prius saepe ostensum; naturale est in ultimo ordinis, nam in illo terminantur interiora omnia, ac ibi simul sunt, et quia simul ibi sunt, et sic simul conspiciuntur innumerabilia 
ut unum, est ibi obscurum respective; de obscuro ibi respective, etiam prius aliquoties actum. @1 2234 AI$ @2 solum$ @3 quod sit bonum, et lapidis quod sit verum, originem habuit a repraesentativis
