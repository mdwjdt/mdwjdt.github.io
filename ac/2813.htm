<h3 align="center" class="ired">属天的奥秘 第2813节</h3>
<h4 align="center"></h4><p><strong>2813.</strong>“捆绑他的儿子以撒”表神圣理性的状态，在这种状况下，就真理而言，神圣理性即将经受终级试探。这从“捆绑”和“他的儿子以撒”的含义清楚可知。“捆绑”是指具备经受终极试探的状态，这从以下事实明显看出来：凡处于试探状态的，都像是被捆绑或被链子锁住。“他的儿子以撒”是指主的神圣理性，在此是指真理方面的（<a href="2802.htm">2802</a>，<a href="2803.htm">2803</a>节）。心智的一切真正理性都由良善与真理构成。就良善而言，主的神圣理性不可能遭遇或经受试探。因为发起试探的恶魔或恶灵无法接近神圣良善，神圣良善超越试探的一切企图和努力。但是，神圣真理一旦被捆绑，就能被试探。因为谬论，尤其虚假会入侵、从而试探它。事实上，关于神圣真理的某些概念能被形成，但关于神圣良善的概念若不通过那些拥有直觉、系属天天使之人，则无法被形成。主降世之时，人们不再承认的是神圣真理。因此，主正是通过神圣真理而经历和承受试探。在主里面，神圣真理被称为“人子”，而神圣良善被称为“神的儿子”。论到“人子”，主多次说，祂要受许多苦，但论到“神的儿子”，祂从未说过这种话。论到人子或神圣真理时，祂说要受许多苦，这一事实明显可见于马太福音：<br />看哪，我们上耶路撒冷去，人子要被交给祭司长和文士。他们要定祂死罪，又把祂交给外邦人戏弄、鞭打、钉在十字架上。（马太福音<a href="http://39-27.cn/太20.18.htm">20:18</a>-<a href="http://39-27.cn/太20.19.htm">19</a>）<br />同一福音书：<br />耶稣对祂的门徒说，看哪，时候到了，人子要被交在罪人手里了。（马太福音<a href="http://39-27.cn/太26.45.htm">26:45</a>）<br />马可福音：<br />耶稣开始教导他们，人子必须受许多的苦，被长老、祭司长和文士弃绝，并且被杀，过三天复活。（马可福音<a href="http://39-27.cn/可8.31.htm">8:31</a>）<br />同一福音书：<br />经上指着人子说，祂要受许多的苦，被人轻慢。人子将要被交在人手里，他们要杀害祂；被杀以后，第三天祂要复活。” （马可福音<a href="http://39-27.cn/可9.12.htm">9:12</a>，<a href="http://39-27.cn/可9.31.htm">31</a>）<br /><br />看哪，我们上耶路撒冷去，人子要被交给祭司长和文士，他们要定祂死罪，把祂交给外邦人。他们要戏弄祂，吐唾沫在祂脸上，杀害祂。第三天，祂要复活。（马可福音<a href="http://39-27.cn/可10.33.htm">10:33</a>-<a href="http://39-27.cn/可10.34.htm">34</a>）<br /><br />时候到了。看哪，人子被卖在罪人手里了。（马可福音<a href="http://39-27.cn/可14.41.htm">14:41</a>）<br />路加福音：<br />人子必须受许多的苦，被长老、祭司长和文士弃绝，并且被杀，第三天复活。（路加福音<a href="http://39-27.cn/路9.22.htm">9:22</a>，<a href="http://39-27.cn/路9.44.htm">44</a>）<br />同一福音书：<br />看哪，我们上耶路撒冷去，先知所写关于人子的一切事都要成就；祂将要被交给外邦人，被戏弄、凌辱、吐唾沫，他们要鞭打并杀害祂，第三日祂要复活。（路加福音<a href="http://39-27.cn/路18.31.htm">18:31</a>-<a href="http://39-27.cn/路18.33.htm">33</a>）<br /><br />天使对那些妇人说，当记念祂还在加利利的时候怎样对你们讲过，说，人子必须被交在罪人手里，钉在十字架上，第三日复活。（路加福音<a href="http://39-27.cn/路24.6.htm">24:6</a>-<a href="http://39-27.cn/路24.7.htm">7</a>）<br />在上述经文中，“人子”表示神圣真理方面的主，也就是内义上圣言方面的主。它要被祭司长和文士弃绝，被凌辱、鞭打、吐唾沫、钉在十字架上。这一点从以下事实很清楚地看出来：犹太人照字面接受一切事，将其用到自己身上，并僭取之；他们也不想知道关于圣言的属灵之义和天国的任何事，以为弥赛亚会来把他们的国提升到地上的万国之上，甚至如今他们还这样认为。由此明显可知，被他们弃绝、凌辱、鞭打、钉在十字架上的，是神圣真理。无论你说神圣真理，还是说神圣真理方面的主，意思都一样。因为主就是真理本身，正如祂是圣言本身那样（<a href="2011.htm">2011</a>，<a href="2016.htm">2016</a>节，<a href="2533.htm">2533</a>节末尾）。<br />主第三日复活也暗示了这一事实：神圣真理或内义上的圣言（如古教会所理解的圣言）要在这世代的末了被复活，这也是“第三日”（<a href="1825.htm">1825</a>，<a href="2788.htm">2788</a>节）。正因如此，经上说人子，也就是神圣真理要在那时显现（马太福音<a href="http://39-27.cn/太24.30.htm">24:30</a>，<a href="http://39-27.cn/太24.37.htm">37</a>，<a href="http://39-27.cn/太24.39.htm">39</a>，<a href="http://39-27.cn/太24.44.htm">44</a>；马可福音<a href="http://39-27.cn/可13.26.htm">13:26</a>；路加福音<a href="http://39-27.cn/路17.22.htm">17:22</a>，<a href="http://39-27.cn/路17.24.htm">24</a>-<a href="http://39-27.cn/路17.26.htm">26</a>，<a href="http://39-27.cn/路17.30.htm">30</a>；<a href="http://39-27.cn/路21.27.htm">21:27</a>，<a href="http://39-27.cn/路21.36.htm">36</a>）。<br />“人子”是指神圣真理方面的主，这从上述经文，以及下列经文明显看出来。马太福音：<br />那撒好种的就是人子，田地就是世界。在世代的末了，人子要差遣祂的使者，把一切叫人作恶的，从祂国里挑出来。（马太福音<a href="http://39-27.cn/太13.37.htm">13:37</a>-<a href="http://39-27.cn/太13.38.htm">38</a>，<a href="http://39-27.cn/太13.41.htm">41</a>-<a href="http://39-27.cn/太13.42.htm">42</a>）<br />此处“好种”表真理，“世界”表人，“撒好种的”表人子，“作恶的”表虚假。约翰福音：<br />众人说，我们从律法上听说，基督是永存的，你怎么说人子必须被举起来呢？这人子是谁呢？耶稣回答他们说：光在你们中间还有不多的时候，应当趁着有光行走，免得黑暗临到你们；那在黑暗里行走的，不知道往何处去。你们应当趁着有光，信从这光，使你们成为光明之子。（约翰福音<a href="http://39-27.cn/约12.34.htm">12:34</a>-<a href="http://39-27.cn/约12.35.htm">35</a>）<br />此处当众人问：“人子是谁”时，耶稣在答复中提到了光，也就是真理，声称祂自己就是他们应当信从的光，或真理。关于来自主的光，也就是真理，可参看前文（<a href="1053.htm">1053</a>，<a href="1521.htm">1521</a>，<a href="1529.htm">1529</a>-<a href="1531.htm">1531</a>，<a href="1619.htm">1619</a>-<a href="1632.htm">1632</a>节）。<br />不过，神的儿子，或在其神性人里面的良善方面的主无法被试探，如前所述。这一事实从福音书中主对于试探的答复明显看出来：<br />那试探的说，你若是神的儿子，可以跳下去，因为经上记着说：主必吩咐祂的使者照顾你，免得你的脚碰在石头上。耶稣对他说：经上又记着说：不可试探主你的神。（马太福音<a href="http://39-27.cn/太4.6.htm">4:6</a>-<a href="http://39-27.cn/太4.7.htm">7</a>；路加福音<a href="http://39-27.cn/路4.9.htm">4:9</a>-<a href="http://39-27.cn/路4.12.htm">12</a>）</p>

And bound Isaac his son. That this signifies the state of the Divine rational thus about to undergo as to truth the last degrees of temptation, is evident from the signification of "binding," and also 
of "Isaac his son." That to "bind" is to put on the state for undergoing the last degrees of temptation, is evident from the fact that he who is in a state of temptation is no otherwise than as bound 
or chained. That "Isaac the son" is the Lord's Divine rational, here as to truth, may be seen above (n. 2802, 2803). All the genuine rational consists of good and truth. The Lord's Divine rational as 
to good could not suffer, or undergo temptations; for no genius or spirit inducing temptations can come near to Good Divine, as it is above all attempt at temptation. But                            
                  Truth Divine bound was what could be tempted; for there are fallacies, and still more falsities, which break in upon and thus tempt it; for concerning Truth Divine some idea can be formed, 
but not concerning Good Divine except by those who have perception, and are celestial angels. It was Truth Divine which was no longer acknowledged when the Lord came into the world, and therefore 
it was that from which the Lord underwent and endured temptations. Truth Divine in the Lord is what is called the "Son of man," but Good Divine is what is called the "Son of God." Of the "Son of man" 
the Lord says many times that He was to suffer, but never of the Son of God. That He says this of the Son of man, or of Truth Divine, is evident in Matthew: </p>
<p>     Behold we go up to Jerusalem, and 
the Son of man shall be delivered, unto the chief priests and scribes, and they shall condemn Him, and shall deliver Him unto the Gentiles to mock and to scourge, and to crucify (Matt. 20:18-19).    
  Jesus said to His disciples, Behold the hour is at hand, and the Son of man is delivered into the hands of sinners (Matt. 26:45). In Mark: </p>
<p>     Jesus began to teach them that the Son of man must suffer 
many things, and be rejected by the elders, and the chief priests, and the scribes, and be killed, and after three days rise again (Mark 8:31).      It is written of the Son of man, that He shall 
suffer many things, and be set at nought. And the Son of man shall be delivered into the hands of men, and they shall kill Him; but when He is killed He shall rise again on the third day (Mark 9:12, 
31).      Behold we go up to Jerusalem, and the Son of man shall be delivered unto the chief priests and the scribes, and they shall condemn Him to death, and shall deliver Him unto the Gentiles, and 
they shall mock Him, and shall spit upon Him, and shall kill Him, and the third day He shall rise again (Mark 10:33-34).      The hour is come; behold the Son of man is betrayed into the hands of 
sinners (Mark 14:41). In Luke: </p>
<p>     The Son of man must suffer many things, and be rejected of the elders and chief priests and scribes, and be killed, and the third day rise again (Luke 9:22, 44).  
    We go up to Jerusalem, where all the things that are written by the prophets concerning the Son of man shall be accomplished; He shall be delivered up unto the Gentiles, and shall be mocked, and 
shamefully entreated, and spit upon, and they shall scourge and kill Him, and the third day He shall rise again (Luke 18:31-33).      The angel said to the women, Remember what He spake unto you when 
He was yet in Galilee, saying that the Son of man must be delivered up into the hands of sinful men, and be crucified, and the third day rise again (Luke 24:6-7). [2] In all these places by the "son 
of man" is meant the Lord as to Truth Divine, or as to the Word in its internal sense, which was rejected by the chief priests and scribes, was shamefully entreated, scourged, spit upon, and crucified, 
as may be clearly evident from the fact that the Jews applied and arrogated everything to themselves according to the letter, and were not willing to know anything about the spiritual sense of the 
Word, and about the heavenly kingdom, believing that the Messiah was to come to raise up their kingdom above all the kingdoms of the earth, as they also believe at this day. Hence it is manifest that 
it was Truth Divine which was rejected by them, shamefully treated, scourged, and crucified. Whether you say Truth Divine, or the Lord as to Truth Divine, it is the same; for the Lord is the Truth itself, 
as He is the Word itself (n. 2011, 2016, 2533 at the end).  [3] The Lord's rising again on the third day also involves that Truth Divine, or the Word as to the internal sense, as it was understood 
by the Ancient Church, will be revived in the consummation of the age, which is also the "third day" (n. 1825, 2788); on which account it is said that the Son of man (that is, Truth Divine) will then 
appear (Matt. 24:30, 37, 39, 44; Mark 13:26; Luke 17:22, 24-26, 30; 21:27, 36).  [4] That the "Son of man" is the Lord as to Truth Divine, is evident from the passages adduced, and further from the 
following. In Matthew: </p>
<p>     He that soweth the good seed is the Son of man, the field is the world. In the consummation of the age the Son of man shall send forth His angels, and they shall gather 
out of His kingdom all things that offend (Matt. 13:37, 41-42); </p>
<p>     where the "good seed" is the truth; the "world" is men; "He that soweth the seed" is the Son of man; and the "things that offend" 
are falsities. In John: </p>
<p>     The multitude said, We have heard out of the Law that the Christ abideth forever; and how sayest Thou that the Son of man must be lifted up? Who is this Son of man ? Jesus 
answered them, A little while is the Light with you; walk while ye have the Light, that darkness overtake you not; for he that walketh in the darkness knoweth not whither he goeth. While ye have the 
Light, believe in the Light, that ye may become the sons of Light (John 12:34-35); </p>
<p>where, when they asked who the Son of man is, Jesus answered concerning the Light, which is the Truth, and that He 
is the Light or Truth in which they should believe. (As regards the Light which is from the Lord, and which is the Divine Truth, see above, n. 1053, 1521, 1529-1531, 1619-1632.)  [5] But that the Son 
of God, or the Lord as to Good in His Human Divine could not be tempted, as was said above, this is manifest also from the Lord's answer to the tempter, in the Evangelists: </p>
<p>     The tempter said, If 
Thou art the Son of God cast Thyself down; for it is written, He shall give His angels charge concerning Thee, lest haply Thou dash Thy foot against a stone. Jesus said unto him, It is written again, 
Thou shalt not tempt the Lord thy God (Matt. 4:6-7; Luke 4:9-12). </p>

<p align="center"><b>Elliott(1983-1999) 2813</b></p><p><b>2813.</b>
'He bound Isaac his son' means the state of the Divine rational which, in this condition as regards truth, was about to undergo the last degrees of temptation. This becomes clear from the meaning of 
'binding', and also of 'Isaac his son' - of 'binding' as the assuming of a state for undergoing the last degrees of temptation, as may become clear from the consideration that anyone in a state of temptation 
is altogether like one who has been bound or fettered; and from the meaning of 'Isaac his son' as the Lord's Divine Rational, here as regards truth, see <a href="2802.htm">2802</a>, <a href="2803.htm">2803</a>. The whole genuine rational 
part of the mind consists of good and of truth. The Lord's Divine Rational as regards good could not suffer, nor undergo temptations, for no genius or spirit initiating temptations is able to get near 
Divine good, as this stands above their every endeavour to tempt. But Divine truth once it had been bound was that which could be tempted, for illusions, and still more falsities, are what invade it 
and so tempt it. Indeed some idea of Divine truth can be formed, but not of Divine good except by beings who have perception and are celestial angels. It was Divine truth that people no longer acknowledged 
at the time of the Lord's Coming into the world, and therefore it was Divine truth from which the Lord underwent and suffered temptations. Divine truth within the Lord is that which is called the 
Son of Man, whereas Divine good within Him is that which is called the Son of God. Speaking of the Son of Man the Lord many times says that He is to suffer, but He never says this when He refers to 
the Son of God. The fact that He speaks of the Son of Man, or Divine truth, having to suffer, is clear in Matthew, </p>

<p><b>[2]</b>
 In all these places 'the Son of Man' is used to mean the Lord as regards Divine truth - that is, as regards the Word in its internal sense - which was to be rejected 
by the chief priests and the scribes, suffer insults, be scourged, spat on, and crucified. This is made quite clear by the fact that the Jews took every single thing literally, applying and misappropriating 
it to themselves, and had no wish to know anything whatever about the spiritual sense of the Word and about a heavenly kingdom. They believed, as they do even today, that when He came the 
Messiah would raise up their kingdom above all the kingdoms of the earth. From this it is evident that it was Divine truth which was rejected, insulted, scourged, and crucified by them. Whether you 
speak of Divine truth or of the Lord as regards Divine truth it amounts to the same, for the Lord is Truth itself just as He is the Word itself, <a href="2011.htm">2011</a>, <a href="2016.htm">2016</a>, <a href="2533.htm">2533</a> (end). </p>
<p></p>
<p><b>[3]</b>
 Also implied in the Lord's 
rising again on the third day is the fact that Divine truth, or the Word as to its internal sense - as it was understood in the Ancient Church - will be brought back to life again at the close of 
the age, which also is 'the third day', <a href="1825.htm">1825</a>, <a href="2788.htm">2788</a>. And this is the reason why it is said that the Son of Man, that is, Divine truth, will appear at that time, <a href="http://bible.gospelcom.net/cgi-bin/bible?passage=Matt%2024:%2030,%2037,%2039,%2044&amp;version=ESV&amp;interface=print&amp;showfn=yes&amp;showxref">Matt 24: 30, 37, 39, 44</a>; <a href="http://bible.gospelcom.net/cgi-bin/bible?passage=Mark%2013:%2026&amp;version=ESV&amp;interface=print&amp;showfn=yes&amp;showxref">Mark 13: 26</a>; <a href="http://bible.gospelcom.net/cgi-bin/bible?passage=Luke%2017:-22,%2024-26,%2030;%2021:%2027,%2036&amp;version=ESV&amp;interface=print&amp;showfn=yes&amp;showxref">Luke 17:-22, 24-26, 30; 21: 27, 36</a>. </p>
<p></p>
<p><b>[4]</b>
 The fact that the Son of Man is the Lord as regards Divine truth is clear from the places quoted already and further still from the following: In Matthew, </p>
<blockquote>
He 
who sows the good seed is the Son of Man; the field is the world. At the close of the age the Son of Man will send His angels, and they will gather out of His kingdom all offences. <a href="http://bible.gospelcom.net/cgi-bin/bible?passage=Matt%2013:%2037,%2041&amp;version=ESV&amp;interface=print&amp;showfn=yes&amp;showxref">Matt 13: 37, 41</a>, 
<a href="42.htm">42</a>. 
</blockquote>
<p>Here 'the good seed' means truth, 'the world' men, 'he who sows it' the Son of Man, and 'offences' falsities. In John, </p>
<blockquote>
The crowd said, We have heard from the Law that the Christ remains for 
ever. Why therefore do you say, The Son of Man must be lifted up? Who is this Son of Man? Jesus answered them, The Light is with you for a brief while. Walk, as long as you have the Light, lest the 
darkness overtakes you, for he who walks in the darkness does not know where he is going. As long as you have the Light believe in the Light, that you may be sons of the Light. <a href="http://bible.gospelcom.net/cgi-bin/bible?passage=John%2012:-34-36&amp;version=ESV&amp;interface=print&amp;showfn=yes&amp;showxref">John 12:-34-36</a>.

<p>Here, 
when the crowd ask, 'Who is the Son of Man?' Jesus speaks in His reply about the Light, which is truth, and says that He Himself is the Light or Truth in which they ought to believe. Regarding the Light 
which comes from the Lord, and which is Divine Truth, see <a href="1053.htm">1053</a>, <a href="1521.htm">1521</a>, <a href="529.htm">529</a>-<a href="1531.htm">1531</a>, <a href="1619.htm">1619</a>-<a href="1632.htm">1632</a>. </p>

 But as for the truth that the Son of God, or the Lord as to the Good within His Divine human, could 
not be tempted, as stated above, this is evident also from the Lord's reply to the tempter, in the gospels, </p>
<blockquote>
The tempter said, If You are the Son of God, throw Yourself down, for it is written, He 
will give His angels charge regarding you, lest you strike your foot against a stone. Jesus said to him, Again it is written, You shall not tempt the Lord your God. <a href="http://bible.gospelcom.net/cgi-bin/bible?passage=Matt%204:%206,%207&amp;version=ESV&amp;interface=print&amp;showfn=yes&amp;showxref">Matt 4: 6, 7</a>; <a href="http://bible.gospelcom.net/cgi-bin/bible?passage=Luke%204:-9-12&amp;version=ESV&amp;interface=print&amp;showfn=yes&amp;showxref">Luke 4:-9-12</a>.

`Ligavit Jishakum filium suum': quod significet statum Rationalis Divini sic quoad verum subituri tentationis ultimos gradus, constare potest a significatione `ligare,' tum `Jishaki filii sui'; ligare 
quod sit {1}induere statum subeundi tentationis ultimos gradus, constare potest inde quod qui in tentationis statu est, non aliter sit ac ligatus aut vinctus; quod `Jishakus filius' sit Rationale Divinum 
Domini', hic quoad verum, videatur n. 2802, 2803; omne rationale genuinum consistit ex bono et vero; Rationale Divinum Domini quoad bonum non potuit pati, seu subire tentationes, ad Bonum enim 
Divinum nullus genius aut spiritus inducens tentationes potest accedere, est supra omnem tentationis conatum; at Verum Divinum ligatum erat quod potuit tentari, fallaciae enim sunt, et magis falsa, quae 
illud infringunt, et ita tentant; de Vero enim Divino potest formari aliqua idea, sed non de Bono Divino nisi ab illis qui perceptionem {2}habent, et sunt angeli caelestes: Verum Divinum erat quod 
non amplius agnoscebatur, cum Dominus venit in mundum, quare illud erat ex quo Dominus subiit et sustinuit tentationes: Verum Divinum in Domino est quod vocatur Filius hominis, Bonum Divinum autem in 
Domino quod vocatur Filius Dei; de Filio hominis pluries dicit Dominus quod passurus, nusquam autem de Filio Dei: quod de Filio hominis seu Vero Divino, constat apud Matthaeum,           Ecce ascendimus 
Hierosolymam, et Filius hominis      tradetur principibus sacerdotibus, et scribis, et condemnabunt      Illum, et tradent Illum gentibus ad illudendum et flagellandum      Illum, et crucifigendum, 
xx 18, 19: </p>
<p>apud eundem,           Jesus dixit discipulis suis, Ecce adest hora, et Filius      hominis tradetur in manus peccatorum, xxvi 45: </p>
<p>     apud Marcum,           Jesus coepit docere 
illos, quod oporteat Filium hominis      multa pati, et reprobari a senioribus, et principibus      sacerdotum, ac scribis, et occidi; post tres tamen dies      resurgere, viii 31: </p>
<p>apud eundem,  
         Scriptum de Filio hominis est, quod multa patietur, et      contemnetur:...et Filius hominis tradetur in manus hominum,      qui occident Illum, sed occisus tertia die resurget, ix 12,    
  31: </p>
<p>apud eundem,           Ecce ascendimus Hierosolymam, et Filius hominis      tradetur principibus sacerdotum et scribis, qui condemnabunt      Illum mortis, tradent Illum ethnicis, hi illudent 
Illum, et      flagellabunt Illum,' et exspuent in Illum, et occident Illum,      tertia tamen dic resurget, x 33, 34: </p>
<p>apud eundem,           Venit hora, ecce tradetur Filius hominis in manus   
    peccatorum, xiv 41: </p>
<p>apud Lucam,           Oportet Filium hominis multa pati, et reprobari a       senioribus et principibus sacerdotum, et scribis, et occidi,      et tertia die resurgere, ix 
22, 44: </p>
<p>apud eundem,           Ascendimus Hierosolymam, ubi perficientur omnia quae       scripta sunt per prophetas de Filio hominis; tradetur      gentilibus, et illudetur, et contumeliis afficietur, 
et      conspuetur, et flagellantes occident Illum, die tamen tertio      resurget, xviii 31-33: </p>
<p>apud eundem,           Angelus ad mulieres, Mementote quod locutus est vobis,      cum adhuc 
esset in Galilaea, dicens, quod oportet Filium      hominis prodi in manus hominum peccatorum, et crucifigi, et      tertio die resurgere, xxiv 6, 7 [2] In omnibus his locis per `Filium hominis' 
intelligitur Dominus quoad Verum Divinum, seu quoad Verbum in sensu suo interno, quod a principibus sacerdotum et scribis reprobaretur, contumeliis afficietur, flagellaretur, exspueretur et crucifigeretur, 
ut constare potest manifeste ex eo quod Judaei omnia et singula sibi applicuerint et arrogaverint secundum litteram, nec scire voluerint quicquam de spirituali sensu Verbi, et de regno caelesti, 
credentes Messiam venturum ad evehendum regnum eorum super omnia regna terrae, sicut etiam hodie credunt inde patet quod Verum Divinum {3}fuerit quod ab illis reprobatum contumeliis affectum, (x)flagellatum 
et crucifixum; sive dicas Verum Divinum, sive Dominum quoad Verum Divinum, idem est, nam Dominus est ipsum Verum, sicut est ipsum Verbum, n. 2011, 2016, [3] 2533 f. Quod Dominus tertia die resurrexerit, 
etiam involvit quod Verum Divinum, seu Verbum quoad sensum internum, sicut intellectum fuit Antiquae Ecclesiae, in consummatione saeculi, quae quoque est `tertia dies,' n. 1825, 2788, resuscitabitur, 
quare dicitur quod tunc apparebit Filius hominis, hoc est, Verum Divinum, {4}Matth.  xxiv 30, 37, 39, 44; Marc. xiii 26; Luc. xvii 22, 24-26, 30; xxi 27, 36. Quod Filius hominis sit Dominus 
quoad Verum Divinum, ex allatis 4 locis constat, et porro ab bis; apud Matthaeum,           Qui seminat bonum semen est Filius hominis, ager est      mundus;...in consummatione saeculi mittet Filius 
hominis      angelos suos, et colligent e regno Ipsius omnia offendicula,      xiii 37, 41, 42; </p>
<p>ubi `bonum semen' est verum, `mundus' sunt homines, `seminans illud' est Filius hominis, `offendicula' 
sunt falsa: apud Johannem,           Dixit turba, Nos audivimus ex Lege quod Christus manet      in aeternum, quomodo ergo tu dicis, oportet exaltari Filium      hominis? quis est hic Filius hominis? 
respondit illis Jesus,      Breve tempus Lux vobiscum est, ambulate quousque Lucem      habetis, ne tenebrae vos apprehendant, nam qui ambulat in      tenebris, non scit quorsum vadit, quousque 
Lucem habetis,      credite in Lucem, ut filii Lucis sitis, xii 34, 35; </p>
<p>ubi cum quaerunt, quis Filius hominis, respondit Jesus de Luce, quae est verum, et quod Ipse sit Lux {5}seu Verum in quod 
crederent; de Luce quae a Domino, quae est Divinum Verum, videatur n. 1053, 1521, 1529-1531, 1619-1632. Quod autem Filius Dei, seu Dominus 5 quoad Bonum in Humano Divino, non potuerit tentari, ut supra 
dictum, patet etiam a responso Domini ad tentatorem, apud Evangelistas,           Dixit tentator, Si Filius es Dei, mitte Te Ipsum      deorsum, scriptum enim est, Angelis suis praecipiet de     
 te,...ne forte offendas ad lapidem pedem tuum. Dixit illi      Jesus, Iterum scriptum est, Non tentabis Dominum Deum tuum,      Matth. iv 6, 7; Luc. iv 9-12. @1 status$ @2 caelestem habent ut angeli$ @3
