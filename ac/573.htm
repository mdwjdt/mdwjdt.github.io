<h3 align="center" class="ired">属天的奥秘 第573节</h3>
<h4 align="center"></h4><p><strong>573.</strong>“耶和华说：我的灵就不永远责备人”是指人不再被如此引领，这一点从上下文清楚看出。从上文明显可知，由于将有关信的教义事项或真理浸没于恶欲，他们变成无法受责备的人，即不再知道何为邪恶。觉察真理与良善的所有能力都被他们的信念熄灭；致使他们只相信迎合自己信念的东西是真理。从下文清楚可知，大洪水之后，教会成员的构成不同，良知取代了觉察力，他通过良知受到谴责。因此，“受耶和华灵的责备”表示一种内在指示，觉察或良知，“耶和华的灵”表真与善的注入，如以赛亚书：<br />我必不永远相争，也不长久发怒，恐怕灵在我面前发昏，灵魂是由我而造（以赛亚书<a href="http://39-27.cn/赛57.16.htm">57:16</a>）。</p>

<p><strong>[NCE]573.</strong> The meaning of Jehovah said, "My spirit will not denounce humankind forever," as the fact that people would no longer be led in the same way can be seen from context. Prior context shows that people developed the character described there by merging religious teachings or truths with their own desires to the point where they could no longer be shown the error of their ways, or see what was evil. All ability to perceive truth and goodness was snuffed out by their self-deceptions, since the only things they believed true were those that conformed with their theories. Subsequent context will show that people in the church changed after the Flood. What arose in them to take the place of perception was conscience, by which they could be rebuked. So the denunciation by Jehovah's spirit symbolizes an inner voice — either perception or conscience — and Jehovah's spirit itself symbolizes truth and goodness flowing in. Isaiah too says:<br />I will not press my quarrel forever; I will not rage eternally, since their spirit would be overwhelmed before me; and I made their souls. (<a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_573/bible_king-james-version_isaiah_57_16" target=_top>Isaiah 57:16</a>) </p>
<p align="center"><b>Potts(1905-1910) 573</b></p><p><b>573.</b>
That by Jehovah's saying My spirit shall not forever reprove man is signified that man would not be so led any longer, is evident from what has gone before and from what follows; from what has gone before 
in that men had become such, through the immersion of the doctrinal things or truths of faith in cupidities, that they could no longer be reproved, that is, know what evil is; all capacity to perceive 
truth and good having been extinguished through their persuasions, so that they believed that only to be true that was in conformity with their persuasions; and in regard to what follows, that 
after the flood the man of the church became different, in that with him conscience succeeded in place of perception, through which he could be reproved. "Reproof by the spirit of Jehovah" therefore signifies 
an inward dictate, a perception, or a conscience; and the "spirit of Jehovah" signifies the influx of what is true and good; as also in Isaiah: </p>
<p>     I will not contend to eternity, neither will 
I be forever wroth, for the spirit would overwhelm before me, and the souls I have made (Isa. 57:16). </p>

<p align="center"><b>Elliott(1983-1999) 573</b></p><p><b>573.</b>
That 'Jehovah said, My spirit will not reprove man for ever' means that man would be led in this fashion no longer is clear from what comes before and after. From what comes before it is clear that by 
immersing doctrinal matters or truths concerning faith in evil desires, they became people who could no longer be reproved, that is, no longer know what evil is. All ability to perceive truth and good 
had been wiped out by their persuasions; only that which was in keeping with their persuasions did they believe to be true. From what comes after it is clear that after the Flood the member of the 
Church was constituted differently. With him perception was replaced by conscience through which he could be reproved. Consequently 'reproof by the spirit of Jehovah' means an inner dictate, perception 
or conscience, and 'the spirit of Jehovah' the influx of truth and good, as in Isaiah also,  </p>
<blockquote>
I will not contend eternally, nor will I be angry for ever; for the spirit from before Me would overwhelm, 
and I have made souls. <a href="http://bible.gospelcom.net/cgi-bin/bible?passage=Isa%2057:16&amp;version=ESV&amp;interface=print&amp;showfn=yes&amp;showxref">Isa 57:16</a>.

</p><b>573.</b>
Quod 'Jehovah dixit, Non arguet spiritus Meus hominem in perpetuum' significet quod homo non ita amplius duceretur, constat ex illis quae praecedunt et quae sequuntur; ex illis quae praecedunt, quod 
tales facti per immersionem doctrinalium seu veritatum fidei in cupiditates ut non amplius potuissent redargui seu scire quid malum; omne perceptivum veri et boni erat per persuasiones exstinctum, id 
solum credentes verum quod persuasionibus eorum conforme: ex illis quae sequuntur, quod aliter homo Ecclesiae factus post diluvium, apud quem loco perceptionis successit conscientia per quam redargui 
posset; quare per 'redargutionem a spiritu Jehovae' significatur dictamen internum, perceptio vel conscientia, et per 'spiritum Jehovae' influxus veri et boni, ut quoque apud Esaiam, 	Non in aeternum 
litigabo, non in perpetuum succensebo, quia spiritus a coram Me obrueret; et animas Ego feci, lvii 	16.
