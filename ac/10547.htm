<h3 align="center" class="ired">属天的奥秘 第10547节</h3>
<h4 align="center"></h4><p><strong>10547</strong>.“他称这帐棚为会幕”表敬拜、教会和圣言的外在，它含有内在之物在里面。这从“会幕”的含义清楚可知。“会幕”是指敬拜、教会和圣言的外在，它含有内在事物在里面；因为“帐棚”表示敬拜、教会和圣言的神圣（参看<a href="10545.htm">10545</a>节），“会”表示内在事物所在的地方，因为一切内在事物都一起存在于外在事物里面（<a href="6451.htm">6451</a>，<a href="9216.htm">9216</a>，<a href="9828.htm">9828</a>，<a href="9836.htm">9836</a>节）。就字义而言，“会”是指以色列人的聚会；但就内义而言，是指教会的真理和良善的聚会，因为以色列人在好的意义上表示整体上教会的真理和良善（<a href="5414.htm">5414</a>，<a href="5879.htm">5879</a>，<a href="5951.htm">5951</a>，<a href="7957.htm">7957</a>节），以色列人的“会众”和“聚会”也是（<a href="7830.htm">7830</a>，<a href="7843.htm">7843</a>节）。此外，圣言、教会和敬拜的真理和良善居于一个内在层面；因为圣言、教会和敬拜的内在包含属天和属灵的事物，而它们的外在是由属世和世俗事物或形像构成的。然而，一切属天和属灵事物都流入属世和世俗事物，终止于其中，形成并构成它们。这解释了为何“会”表示外在之物。这就是被称为字义的圣言外在意义的情形；这也是教会和敬拜的外在事物的情形，因为它们都来自圣言。</p>

And he called it the tent of meeting. That this signifies the external of worship, of the church, and of the Word, in which are internal things, is evident from the signification of "the tent of meeting," 
as being the external of worship, of the church, and of the Word, in which are things internal; for by "tent" is signified what is holy of worship, of the church, and of the Word (see n. 10545), 
and by "meeting" is signified where internal things are, for all internal things are together in external things (n. 6451, 9216, 9828, 9836). In the sense of the letter by "meeting" is meant the meeting 
of the sons of Israel; but in the internal sense there is signified the meeting of the truths and goods of the church, because by the sons of Israel in a good sense are signified the truths and goods 
of the church in the complex (n. 5414, 5879, 5951, 7957), in like manner by the "congregation" and the "assemblage" of the sons of Israel (n. 7830, 7843). And the truths and goods of the Word, of 
the church, and of worship are in their own internal; for in the internal of the Word, of the church, and of worship are celestial and spiritual things; but in the external are natural and worldly things; 
and all celestial and spiritual things flow into natural and worldly things, and terminate in them, and form and constitute them. From this it is that what is external is signified by "meeting." 
This is the case with the external sense of the Word, which is called the sense of its letter, thus also with the externals of the church and of worship, for these are from the Word. </p>

<p align="center"><b>Elliott(1983-1999) 10547</b></p><p><b>10547.</b>
'And called it the tent of meeting' means the external aspect of worship, the Church, and the Word, which holds internal things within it. This is clear from the meaning of 'the tent of meeting' as the 
external aspect of worship, the Church, and the Word, which holds internal things within it; for 'the tent' means the holiness of worship, the Church, and the Word, <a href="10545.htm">10545</a>, and 'meeting' means where 
internal things are, since all internal things exist together within external ones, see <a href="6451.htm">6451</a>, <a href="9216.htm">9216</a>, <a href="9828.htm">9828</a>, <a href="9836.htm">9836</a>. In the sense of the letter 'meeting' describes a coming together of the children of Israel, 
but in the internal sense it means a coming together of the Church's truths and forms of good, since the Church's truths and forms of good in their entirety are meant in the good sense by 'the children 
of Israel', see <a href="5414.htm">5414</a>, <a href="5879.htm">5879</a>, <a href="5951.htm">5951</a>, <a href="7957.htm">7957</a>, and in like manner by 'the congregation and assembly of the children of Israel', <a href="7830.htm">7830</a>, <a href="7843.htm">7843</a>. Furthermore the truths and forms of good that reside in the 
Word, the Church, and worship do so on an internal level, for internally the Word, the Church, and worship contain celestial and spiritual realities, but externally they consist of natural and worldly 
images. Yet all the celestial and spiritual realities pass into the natural and worldly images; they terminate in them, give shape to them, and compose them. This explains why the external aspect is 
meant by 'meeting'. Such is the situation with the external or outward sense of the Word, called its literal sense; such also is the situation with the external things of the Church and worship, for they 
come from the Word.  </p>

`Et vocavit illud tentorium conventus':  quod significet externum cultus, Ecclesiae, et Verbi, in quo interna, constat ex significatione `tentorii conventus' quod sit externum cultus, Ecclesiae, et 
Verbi, in quo interna, per `tentorium' enim significatur sanctum cultus, Ecclesiae, et Verbi, n. 10545, et per `conventum' significatur ubi interna {1}, nam omnia interna simul in externis sunt, videatur 
n. 6451, 9216, 9828, 9836.  Per `conventum' in sensu litterae intelligitur conventus filiorum Israelis, at in sensu interno significatur conventus verorum et bonorum Ecclesiae, quoniam per `filios 
Israelis' in bono sensu significantur vera et bona Ecclesiae in complexu, videatur n. 5414, 5879, 5951, (x)7957, similiter per `congregationem et coetum' {2}filiorum Israelis, n. 7830, 7843; ac vera 
et bona Verbi, Ecclesiae, et cultus in interno (d)eorum sunt, nam in interno {2}Verbi, Ecclesiae, et cultus sunt caelestia et spiritualia, in externo autem naturalia et mundana, ac omnia caelestia et 
spiritualia influunt in naturalia et mundana, et desinunt in `{3}illa, (c)ac formant (c)et constituunt illa; inde est quod externum (x)significetur per `conventum'; ita se habet cum sensu externo Verbi,
