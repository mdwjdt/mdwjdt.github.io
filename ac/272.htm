<h3 align="center" class="ired">属天的奥秘 第272节</h3>
<h4 align="center"></h4><p><strong>272.</strong>创世记3:18 土必给你长出荆棘和蒺藜来，你要吃田间的草本。<br />“荆棘和蒺藜”表咒诅和毁灭，“你要吃田间的草本”表示他要像动物一样生活。当内在与外在分离以后，人就如动物一般，因为人是凭内在从主所受的才成为人，而照从外在所受的，人不过是动物。脱离了内在，外在就只是动物，有着和动物一样的性情、欲望、嗜好、幻想、知觉，乃至相似的组织构造。唯一不同的是，人的外在拥有理性，也自以为聪明。该理性来自灵魂从主所受的生命之流，对于外在与内在颠倒之人，该生命也被颠倒，成了恶之生命，亦即死，他被称为“死人”，原因在此。</p>

<p><strong>[NCE]272.</strong> <a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_272/bible_king-james-version_genesis_3_18" target=_top>Genesis 3:18</a>. "And it will produce thorn and thistle for you, and you will eat the grass of the field."<br />Thorn and thistle mean the curse and ruination. The fact that he would eat the grass of the field means that they would live like animals.<br />We live like animals when our inner being is so radically separated from our outer being that the inner being cannot direct it except in the most general way. Our identity as human beings we receive from the Lord through our inner selves, but our identity as animals we receive from our outer selves. The outer self separated from the inner is in itself merely an animal; its nature, its desires, its appetites, its delusions, and its sensations are like an animal's, and its physiology is similar as well.{*1} Despite the similarities, our outer self has the ability to engage in reasoning — with keen penetration, as it seems to us — and this ability is ours by virtue of the spiritual substance through which the Lord's life can flow into us.{*2} But when that self is disconnected from our inner self, the Lord's life is perverted in us and becomes an evil life, which is death, and this is why we are then called dead.<br /><br /><strong>Footnotes:</strong><br />{*1} On the fascination of Swedenborg's age with the difference between animal and human, see note 1 in <a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_272/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_196" target=_top>196</a>. [SS]<br />{*2} Swedenborg uses the term substance, both here and generally, to refer to what he sees as the spiritual equivalent of matter.

<p align="center"><b>Potts(1905-1910) 272</b></p><p><b>272.</b>
Verse 18. And the thorn and the thistle shall it bring forth unto thee, and thou shalt eat the herb of the field. By the "thorn and the thistle" are meant curse and vastation; and by "thou shalt eat 
the herb of the field" is signified that he should live as a wild animal. Man lives like a wild animal when his internal man is so separated from his external as to operate upon it only in a most general 
manner, for man is man from what he receives through his internal man from the Lord, and is a wild animal from what he derives from the external man, which, separated from the internal, is in itself 
no other than a wild animal, having a similar nature, desires, appetites, phantasies, and sensations, and also similar organic forms. That nevertheless he is able to reason, and, as it seems to himself, 
acutely, he has from the spiritual substance by which he receives the influx of life from the Lord, which is however perverted in such a man, and becomes the life of evil, which is death. Hence 
he is called a dead man. </p>

<p align="center"><b>Elliott(1983-1999) 272</b></p><p><b>272.</b>
Verse 18 And thorn and thistle will it bring forth for you, and you will eat the plant of the field.  </p>
<p>'Thorn and thistle' are used to mean curse and vastation. 'He was to eat the plant of the field' 
means that he was to live as a wild animal does. A person lives as a wild animal when the internal man is so separated from the external that it operates into it only in a very general way. For what 
comes from the Lord by way of the internal man makes a person human, but what comes from the external, which when separated from the internal within him is nothing but a wild animal, makes a person 
a wild animal. The disposition within him is similar to that of a wild animal, as are the desires, the appetites, the delusions, and the sensations. His organic parts are similar too. His ability however 
to reason, and as it seems to him, to do so incisively, is the product of spiritual substance, by way of which the Lord's life is able to flow into him, but which is corrupted with that kind of person 
and becomes a life of evil which is 'death'. This is why he is called a 'dead' man.  </p>

<p align="center"><b>Latin(1748-1756) 272</b>
</p><b>272.</b>
Vers. 18.  Et spinam et carduum proferet tibi, et edes herbam agri.  Per 'spinam et carduum' intelligitur maledictio et vastatio: [per] 'quod ederet herbam agri' significatur quod viveret ut fera. 	Ut 
fera vivit cum internus homo separatur ab externo ita ut non operetur in eum nisi communissime; nam quod homo sit homo, habet per internum hominem a Domino; at quod homo sit fera, habet ab externo, 
qui separatus ab interno in se non aliud est quam fera; similis natura ei inest, similes cupiditates, similes appetitus, similes phantasiae, et similes sensationes; organica quoque sunt similia: quod 
tamen ratiocinari possit ac, ut sibi videtur, astute, hoc habet a spirituali substantia, per quam vita Domini influere possit, sed quae apud talem pervertitur et fit vita mali, quae est mors; inde vocatur mortuus. </p>
