<h3 align="center" class="ired">属天的奥秘 第4476节</h3>
<h4 align="center"></h4><p><strong>4476.</strong>“他在他父亲全家族中也是最受尊重的”表这个教会的真理在古人当中是首要的。这从“最受尊重”的含义清楚可知，“最受尊重”是指首要的。“最受尊重”的几乎和“首领”差不多，“首领”这个词就表示首要的（参看<a href="1482.htm">1482</a>，<a href="2089.htm">2089</a>节）。不过，经上之所以说“他在他父亲全家族中是最受尊重的”，而不是说“首领”，是因为哈抹和示剑是上古教会余留的一部分（<a href="4447.htm">4447</a>，<a href="4454.htm">4454</a>节）；在古教会被称为首领的，在上古教会则被称为“受尊重的”。之所以表示古人当中的教会真理的首要之物，是因为这是指着示剑说的，而示剑代表古人当中的教会的真理（参看<a href="4454.htm">4454</a>节）。</p>

<p align="center"><b>Potts(1905-1910) 4476</b></p><p><b>4476.</b>
And he was honored above all the house of his father. That this signifies what is primary of the truths of the Church among the  is evident from the signification of "honored above all," as being what 
is primary. He that is "honored above all" is nearly the same as a "prince," which term denotes what is primary (see n. 1482, 2089). But he is said to be "honored above all the house of his father," 
and not a "prince," because Hamor and Shechem were of the remains of the Most Ancient Church (n. 4447, 4454); and in that church he was said to be "honored," who in the Ancient Church was called a "prince." 
That what is primary of the truths of the Church among the Ancients is signified, is because this is said of Shechem, by whom is represented the truth of the Church among the Ancients, as may 
be seen above (n. 4454). </p>

<p align="center"><b>Elliott(1983-1999) 4476</b></p><p><b>4476.</b>
'And he was honoured above all those of his father's house' means the foremost of the truths of the Church among the Ancients. This is clear from the meaning of 'honoured above all' as that which is 
foremost. 'One who is honoured above all' is almost the same in meaning as a prince, who means that which is first and foremost, see <a href="1482.htm">1482</a>, <a href="2089.htm">2089</a>. But the expression 'honoured above all those of his father's 
house' is used and not 'prince' because Hamor and Shechem were part of the remnants of the Most Ancient Church, <a href="4447.htm">4447</a>, <a href="4454.htm">4454</a>, and one who in the Ancient Church was called a prince was in the Most 
Ancient called 'honoured'. The reason why the foremost of the truths of the Church among the Ancients is meant is that this description is used of Shechem, who represents the truth of the Church among 
the Ancients, see <a href="4454.htm">4454</a> </p>

</p><b>4476.</b>
`Et ille honoratus prae omnibus domus patris sui': quod significet primarium ex veris Ecclesiae apud antiquos, constat ex significatione `honorati prae omnibus' quod sit primarium; </p>
<p>honoratus prae 
omnibus paene simile est ac princeps, qui quod sit primarium, videatur n. 1482, 2089; sed `honoratus prae omnibus domus patris sui' dicitur, non princeps, quia Hamor et Shechemus erant ex reliquiis 
Antiquissimae Ecclesiae, n. 4447, 4454, et in illa Ecclesia `honoratus' dicebatur qui in Antiqua Ecclesia `princeps': quod primarium ex veris Ecclesiae apud antiquos significetur, est quia de Shechemo 
hoc dicitur, per quem quod repraesentetur verum Ecclesiae apud antiquos, videatur n. 4454 </p>
