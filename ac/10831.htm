That there is a trine in the Lord, namely, the Divine Itself, the Divine Human, and the proceeding Divine, is a secret from heaven, and is for those who will be in the holy Jerusalem. </p>
<p>     EXODUS 
40 </p>
<p>     1. And Jehovah spoke unto Moses, saying,      2. On the first day of the month, in the first month, shalt thou rear up the Habitation of the Tent of meeting.      3. And thou shalt put therein 
the ark of the Testimony, and thou shalt cover the veil over the ark.      4. And thou shalt bring in the table, and shalt set in order the ordering thereof; and thou shalt bring in the lampstand, 
and shalt make the lamps thereof to go up.      5. And thou shalt set the altar of gold for incense before the ark of the Testimony, and shalt put the covering of the door to the Habitation.    
  6. And thou shalt set the altar of burnt-offering before the door of the Habitation of the Tent of meeting.      7. And thou shalt set the laver between the Tent of meeting and the altar, and shalt 
put waters therein.      8. And thou shalt set the court round about, and shalt set, the covering of the gate of the court.      9. And thou shalt take the oil of anointing, and anoint the Habitation, 
and all that is therein, and thou shalt sanctify it, and all the vessels thereof; and it shall be holy.      10. And thou shalt anoint the altar of burnt-offering, and all its vessels, and shalt 
sanctify the altar; and the altar shall be a holy of holies.      11. And thou shall anoint the laver and its base, and shalt sanctify it.      12. And thou shalt make Aaron and his sons to come near 
unto the door of the Tent of meeting, and shalt wash them with waters.      13. And thou shall clothe Aaron with the garments of holiness, and thou shall anoint him, and sanctify him, that he may minister 
to Me in the priest's office.      14. And thou shalt make his sons to come near, and shalt clothe them with tunics.      15. And thou shalt anoint them, as thou didst anoint their father, and 
they shall minister to Me in the priest's office; and their anointing shall be to them for the priesthood of an age in their generations.      16. And Moses did according to all that Jehovah commanded 
him, so did he.      17. And it came to pass in the first month, in the second year, on the first day of the month, that the Habitation was reared up.      18. And Moses reared up the Habitation, 
and set its bases, and placed the planks thereof, and put in the bars thereof, and reared up its pillars.      19. And be spread the Tent over the Habitation, and put the covering of the Tent upon 
it above; as Jehovah commanded Moses.      20. And he took and put the Testimony into the ark, and placed the staves upon the ark, and put the propitiatory upon the ark above.      21. And he brought 
the ark into the Habitation, and set the veil of the covering, and covered over the ark of the Testimony; as Jehovah commanded Moses.      22. And he put the table in the Tent of meeting, upon the 
leg of the Habitation northward, without the veil.      23. And he set in order upon it the ordering of the bread before Jehovah; as Jehovah commanded Moses.      24. And he put the lampstand in the 
Tent of meeting, hard by the table, on the leg of the Habitation toward the south.      25. And he made the lamps go up before Jehovah; as Jehovah commanded Moses.      26. And he put the altar of 
gold in the Tent of meeting before the veil; </p>
<p>     27. And he burnt thereon incense of spices; as Jehovah commanded Moses.      28. And he put the covering of the door to the Habitation.      29. And 
he placed the altar of burnt-offering at the door of the Habitation of the Tent of meeting, and he made to go up upon it the burnt-offering and the meat-offering; as Jehovah commanded Moses.      
30. And he placed the laver between the Tent of meeting and the alter, and put waters therein, to wash.      31. And Moses and Aaron and his sons washed out of it their hands and their feet.      32. 
When they entered into the Tent of meeting, and when they came near unto the altar, they washed; as Jehovah commanded Moses.      33. And he reared up the court round about the Habitation, and the 
altar, and set the covering of the gate of the court. And Moses finished the work.      34. And the cloud covered the Tent of meeting, and the glory of Jehovah filled the Habitation.      35. And Moses 
could not enter into the Tent of meeting, because the cloud tarried upon it, and the glory of Jehovah filled the Habitation.      36. And when the cloud went up from over the Habitation, the sons 
of Israel journeyed in all their journeyings.      37. And if the cloud went not up, then they journeyed not till the day that it went up.      38. Because the cloud of Jehovah was upon the Habitation 
by day, and there was fire in it by night, in the eyes of all the house of Israel, in all their journeyings. </p>

And Moses did according to all that Jehovah had commanded him; so he did.  <LI value='17'> And it happened in the first month in the second year, on the first [day] in the month, that the dwelling-place was erected. 
 <LI value='18'> And Moses erected the dwelling-place, and put down its bases, and set its boards in place, and put in its bars, and erected its pillars.  <LI value='19'> And he spread the tent over the dwelling-place, and 
placed the covering of the tent over it, up above, as Jehovah had commanded Moses.  <LI value='20'> And he took the Testimony and put it into the ark, and set the poles in place on the ark, and put the mercy-seat 
on the ark, up above.  <LI value='21'> And he brought the ark into the dwelling-place, and set in place the veil of the screen, and screened the ark of the Testimony, as Jehovah had commanded Moses.  <LI value='22'> And 
he put the table into the tent of meeting on the north side of the dwelling-place<A name="fntext7"></a><A href="#fn7"><sup>g</sup></a>, outside the veil.  <LI value='23'> And he arranged on it the arrangement of the bread before Jehovah, as Jehovah had commanded

Jehovah had commanded Moses.  <LI value='30'> And he placed the laver between the tent of meeting and the altar, and put water in it for washing.  <LI value='31'> And Moses and Aaron and his sons washed their hands and their 
feet [with water] from it.  <LI value='32'> When they went into the tent of meeting, and when they drew near the altar, they washed, as Jehovah had commanded Moses.  <LI value='33'> And he erected the court around the dwelling-place

 <LI value='35'> And Moses could not enter the tent of meeting, because the cloud rested over it, and the glory of Jehovah filled the dwelling-place.  <LI value='36'> And when the cloud went up from over the dwelling-place 
the children of Israel journeyed in all their journeys.  <LI value='37'> And if the cloud did not go up they did not journey until the day of its going up.  <LI value='38'> For the cloud of Jehovah was over the dwelling-place

Quod Trinum in Domino sit, nempe ipsum Divinum, Divinum Humanum, et Divinum procedens, est arcanum e caelo, et pro illis qui in Sancta Hierosolyma erunt. </p>
<p>CAPUT XL 	1.  Et locutus est JEHOVAH ad 
Moschen, dicendo, 	2.  In die mensis primi in primo mensi, eriges habitaculum tentorii conventus. 	3.  Et pones ibi arcam testimonii, et teges super arcam velum. 	4.  Et introduces mensam, et dispones 
dispositionem ejus, et introduces candelabrum, et ascendere facies lucernas ejus. 	5.  Et dabis altare auri pro suffitu ante arcam testimonii, et pones tegumentum ostii habitaculo. 	6.  Et dabis 
altare holocausti ante ostium habitaculi tentorii conventus. 	7.  Et dabis labrum inter (x)tentorium conventus, et inter altare, et dabis ibi aquas. 	8.  Et pones atrium circumcirca, et dabis tegumentum 
portae atrii. 	9.  Et accipies oleum unctionis, et unges habitaculum, et omnia quae in illo, et sanctificabis illud, et omnia vasa ejus; et erit sanctum. 	10.  Et unges altare holocausti, et omnia 
vasa ejus, et sanctificabis altare, et erit altare sanctum sanctorum. 	11.  Et unges labrum et basin ejus, et sanctificabis illud. 	12.  Et appropinquare facies Aharonem et filios ejus ad ostium 
tentorii conventus, et lavabis illos aquis. 	13.  Et induere facies Aharonem vestibus sanctitatis, et unges illum, et sanctificabis illum, et sacerdotio fungetur Mihi. 	14.  Et filios ejus appropinquare 
facies, et induere facies illos tunicis. 	15.  Et unges illos quemadmodum unxisti patrem illorum, et sacerdotio fungentur Mihi, et erit ad esse illis unctio eorum ad sacerdotium saeculi generationibus 
illorum. 	16.  Et fecit Moscheh secundum omnia quae praecepit JEHOVAH illi, ita fecit. 	17.  Et factum in mense primo in anno secundo in primo mensi, erectum est habitaculum. 	18.  Et erexit 
Moscheh habitaculum, et dedit bases ejus, et posuit asseres ejus, et dedit vectes ejus, et erexit columnas ejus. 	19.  Et expandit tentorium super habitaculum, et posuit tegumentum tentorii super 
illud superius, quemadmodum praecepit JEHOVAH Moschi. 	20.  Et accepit et dedit testimonium in arcam, et posuit vectes super arcam, et dedit propitiatorium super arcam superius. 	21.  Et introduxit 
arcam in habitaculum, et posuit velum tegumenti, et texit super arcam testimonii, quemadmodum praecepit JEHOVAH Moschi. 	22.  Et dedit mensam in tentorium conventus ad crus habitaculi septentrionem versus 
ab extra velum. 	23.  Et disposuit super illa dispositionem panis coram JEHOVAH, quemadmodum praecepit JEHOVAH Moschi. 	24.  Et posuit candelabrum in tentorio conventus juxta mensam ad crus habitaculi 
meridiem versus. 	25.  Et ascendere fecit lucernas coram JEHOVAH, quemadmodum praecepit JEHOVAH Moschi. 	26.  Et posuit altare auri in tentorio conventus coram velo. 	27.  Et suffivit super 
illo suffimentum aromatum, quemadmodum praecepit JEHOVAH Moschi. 	28.  Et posuit tegumentum ostii habitaculo. 	29.  Et altare holocausti posuit ad ostium habitaculi tentorii conventus, et ascendere 
fecit super illo holocaustum et minham, quemadmodum praecepit JEHOVAH Moschi. 	30.  Et posuit labrum inter tentorium conventus et inter altare, et dedit eo aquas ad lavandum. 	31.  Et laverunt ex 
illo Moscheh et Aharon, et filii ejus manus suas et pedes suos. 	32.  In intrando illos in tentorium conventus, et in appropinquando illos ad altare, laverunt, quemadmodum praecepit JEHOVAH Moschi. 	33. 
 Et erexit atrium circum habitaculum, et altare, et dedit tegumentum portae atrii; et absolvit Moscheh opus. 	34.  Et obtexit nubes tentorium conventus, et gloria JEHOVAE implevit habitaculum. 	35. 
 Et non potuit Moscheh intrare in tentorium conventus quia commorabatur super illo nubes, et gloria JEHOVAE implevit habitaculum. 	36.  Et in ascendendo nubes a super habitaculo profecti sunt filii 
Israelis in omnibus profectionibus suis. 	37.  Et si non ascendit nubes, et non profecti sunt, usque ad diem ascendere illam. 	38.  Quia nubes JEHOVAE super habitaculo interdiu, et ignis erat noctu 
in illo, in oculis omnis domus Israelis, in omnibus profectionibus eorum. </p>
