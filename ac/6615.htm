<h3 align="center" class="ired">属天的奥秘 第6615节</h3>
<h4 align="center"></h4><p><strong>6615.</strong>当天使的思维降至较低层面时，就像刚才说的，它会显为一朵闪亮的白云。但当处于更高层天堂的天使的思维下降时，它显为一束火光，发出闪耀的光辉。这闪亮的白云和火光无非是包含在他们思维中的无数细节。当这些细节流入下面灵人的思维时，它们在那里只呈现为一个事物；光和光辉流入这些灵人的思维，火热流入他们那源于爱的情感，这些情感引导他们的观念，将这些观念联结起来。不过，这些灵人看不见所发出的火光和闪耀的光辉。然而，我看见了它们，好叫我能知道更高事物流入更低事物；并且无数细节被感知为一体。</p>

When the thought of angels descends to lower planes, it appears, as just said, like a bright cloud; but when the thought of the angels who are in the higher heavens descends, it appears like a flaming 
light, from which comes a quivering brightness. This bright cloud and flaming light are nothing else than the countless things that are in their thought. When these flow into the thought of the spirits 
who are beneath, they are there presented as only one thing; the light and brightness flow into their thought, and the flaming into their affection which is of love, which affection leads the ideas 
and joins them together. But the bright flaming and the quivering brightness do not appear to them, but were seen by me in order that I might know that higher things flow into lower ones; and that there 
are countless things which are perceived as one. </p>

When angels' thought passes down onto lower levels it is seen, as stated immediately above, as a shining white cloud. But when the thought of angels who are in the higher heavens passes down it appears 
as a fiery light which emits flashes of brilliance. The shining white cloud and the fiery light are nothing else than the countless details contained within their thought. When those details enter 
the thought of the spirits below them they present themselves there merely as a single unit. The light and brilliance pass into the spirits' thought, and the fieriness into the affection which springs 
from their love and which leads and draws together their ideas. But the fiery light that was emitted and the flashes of brilliance are not seen by those spirits. They have been made visible to myself 
however so that I might know that higher things pass into lower ones, and that there are countless details which are perceived as a single unit. </p>

</p><b>6615.</b>
Cogitatio angelorum cum delabitur ad inferiora, apparet, {1}ut mox supra dictum, sicut nubes candida; at cogitatio angelorum qui in superioribus caelis cum delabitur, apparet instar lucis flammeae ex 
qua vibratio splendoris; nubes illa candida et lux flammea non aliud sunt quam innumerabilia quae cogitatione (c)illorum insunt; haec cum influunt in cogitationem spirituum qui infra sunt, ibi sistuntur 
modo sicut unum; lux et splendor influit in cogitationem (c)illorum, et flammeum in affectionem quae amoris, quae ducit ideas et conjungit illas; sed lucidum flammeum (c)et vibratile splendens, non 
apparet illis; sed visa sunt mihi ut scirem quod superiora influant in inferiora, et quod innumerabilia sint quae sicut unum percipiuntur. @1 etiam quandoque$ </p>
