<h3 align="center" class="ired">属天的奥秘 第10607节</h3>
<h4 align="center"></h4><p><strong>10607</strong>.“谁也不可和你一同上来”表以色列民族不能站在神性真理中。这从“不上来”的含义清楚可知，“不上来”，此处即不与摩西上西乃山，是指不进入神性真理的启示所来自的天堂，因而不能站在神性真理中。因为“西乃山”表示神性真理的启示所来自的天堂（参看<a href="8805.htm">8805</a>，<a href="8931.htm">8931</a>，<a href="9420.htm">9420</a>，<a href="10605.htm">10605</a>节）；“摩西”代表接受神性真理的教会、敬拜和圣言所取的外在形式。所指的是以色列民族，这是显而易见的，因为这个禁令，即“谁也不可和你一同上来”，以及“遍山都不可见到人”指着这个民族的成员说的。<br />“摩西”在此代表接受神性真理的圣言、教会和敬拜所取的外在形式，这一点从本章的一切细节明显看出来，如：⑴摩西要上到西乃山，站在那里的山顶上，百姓要从山上搬回来。⑵在接下来的经文中，耶和华对摩西说话，好像只和他说话，没有和百姓说话一样，如第10节：“在你中间的众百姓都要看见，这是我向你所行的一件奇事”；11节：“我今天所吩咐你的，你要谨守；看哪，我要从你面前撵出”；12节：“你要谨慎，恐怕你与所去的那地的居民立约”；14节：“不可向别神下拜”；15节：“恐怕你与那地的居民立约，有人叫你，你便吃他们的祭物”；16节：不可“为你的儿子娶他们的女儿”等等。⑶后来，经上说，摩西的面皮发光；百姓怕挨近他；因此每当与百姓说话时，他都用帕子蒙上脸。<br />从这一切细节明显看出，在本章，摩西代表接受神性真理的圣言、教会和敬拜所取的外在形式，里面的神性真理就通过这外在形式闪耀出来。摩西代表这外在形式，而非它里面所含的东西，这一点从本章的一切细节同样明显看出来，如：耶和华在云中降临，和摩西一同站立，因为“云”表示圣言所取的外在形式；然后耶和华将所要遵守的教会和敬拜的外在事物，而不是内在事物吩咐给他。在前一章，摩西代表某种类似的外在事物，这从7-11和17-23节经文（参看<a href="10563.htm">10563</a>，<a href="10571.htm">10571</a>节）明显看出来。但不接受任何内在事物的一个外在就存在于以色列民族当中。</p>

And no man shall come up with thee. That this signifies that the Israelitish nation cannot be in Divine truth, is evident from the signification of "not coming up," here into Mount Sinai with Moses, 
as being not to be in heaven from which is the revelation of Divine truth, thus not to be able to be in Divine truth, for by "Mount Sinai" is signified heaven from which comes the revelation of Divine 
truth (see n. 8805, 8931, 9420, 10605); and by Moses is represented that external of the church, of worship, and of the Word, which receives Divine truth. It is evident that the Israelitish nation is 
meant, because it is said of it, "no man shall come up with thee," and "neither let any man be seen in the whole mountain." [2] That Moses here represents that external of the Word, of the church, and 
of worship, which receives Divine truth, is evident from every detail of this chapter, as that Moses should go up into Mount Sinai, and should stand there on the head of it, and that the people should 
be removed therefrom. In what follows also Jehovah speaks unto Moses as unto him, and not unto the people; as in verse 10, "All the people in the midst of whom thou art shall see that this is a wonderful 
thing that I do with thee;" in verse 11, "Keep thou that which I command thee this day; behold I drive out from thy faces;" in verse 12, "Take heed to thyself, lest perchance thou make a covenant 
with the inhabitant of the land upon which thou comest;" in verse 14, "Thou shalt not bow thyself to another god;" in verse 15, "Lest perchance thou make a covenant with the inhabitant of the land, 
and he call thee, and thou eat of his sacrifice;" in verse 16, "Take thou not of his daughters for thy sons;" and so on. Afterward it is said that the skin of Moses' face shone; and that the people 
were afraid to come near him; and that on this account he put a veil on his face when he spoke with the people.  [3] From all this it is evident that Moses in this chapter represents that external of 
the Word, of the church, and of worship which receives Divine truth, thus through which internal Divine truth shines. That Moses represents this external, and not the internal, is also evident from everything 
in this chapter; as that Jehovah descended in the cloud, and stood with him, for by a "cloud" is signified the external of the Word; and then that Jehovah commanded to him the external things 
of the church and of worship, which were to be observed, and not the internal things. The like external was represented by Moses in the preceding chapter, as is evident from verses 7 to 11, and from 
verses 17 to 23 (n. 10563, 10571). But the external which did not receive the internal appertained to the Israelitish nation. </p>

'And no one shall come up with you' means that the Israelite nation is incapable of standing in Divine Truth. This is clear from the meaning of 'not coming up', in this instance of not coming up with 
Moses onto Mount Sinai, as not going into heaven from which Divine Truth is revealed, thus as being incapable of standing in Divine Truth. For 'Mount Sinai' means heaven, from which the revelation of 
Divine Truth comes, see <a href="8805.htm">8805</a>, <a href="8931.htm">8931</a>, <a href="9420.htm">9420</a>, <a href="10605.htm">10605</a>; and 'Moses' represents the outward form taken by the Church, worship, and the Word, which is where Divine Truth is received. The fact that the Israelite 
nation is meant is self-evident, for the prohibitions 'no one shall come up with you' and 'no one shall be seen on all the mountain' refer to members of that nation.  </p>
<p></p>
<p><b>[2]</b>
 The fact that 'Moses' at 
this point represents the outward form taken by the Word, the Church, and worship, which is where Divine Truth is received, is clear from all the details in the present chapter, such as these:  <a href="1.htm">1</a> The 
requirement that Moses should go up onto Mount Sinai and stand there at the top of it, and that the people should be moved back from it.  <a href="2.htm">2</a> Jehovah's talking to Moses, in the verses that follow, as 
if He were doing so only to him and not to the people<A name="fntext1"></a><A href="#fn1"><sup>a</sup></a> - All the people in whose midst you are will see that this is a marvel which I am doing with you, verse 10. Observe that which I command you this 
day. Behold, I am driving out from your face, verse 11. Take care, lest by chance you make a covenant with the inhabitants of the land onto which you come, verse 12. You shall not bow down to any other 
god, verse 14. Lest by chance you make a covenant with the inhabitants of the land, and they call you, and you eat of their sacrifice, verse 15. You are not to take their daughters for your sons, 
verse 16. And so on in verses after these.  <a href="3.htm">3</a> The gleaming of the skin on Moses' face, described later on in this chapter, and the people's fear to approach him, so that he put a veil over his face 
whenever he talked to the people.  </p>
<p></p>
<p><b>[3]</b>
 From all these details it is evident that in the present chapter Moses represents the outward form taken by the Word, the Church, and worship, which is where 
Divine Truth is received and so is that through which the Divine Truth within shines out. The fact that Moses represents that outward form and not what it holds within it is likewise evident from all 
the details in the present chapter, such as the reference to Jehovah's descending in the cloud and His standing with him (for 'the cloud means the outward form which the Word takes) and then His commanding 
him what the external observances of the Church and worship were to be, but not what the internal ones were. Something similarly external or outward was represented by Moses in the previous chapter, 
as is evident in verses 7-11 and verses 17-23, see <a href="10563.htm">10563</a>, <a href="10571.htm">10571</a>. But an external unreceptive of anything internal existed among the Israelite nation.

`Et quisquam non ascendet tecum':  quod significet quod gens Israelitica non (x)possit in Divino Vero esse, constat ex significatione `ascendere,' hic in montem Sinai cum Mosche, quod sit non in caelum 
unde revelatio Divini Veri, ita non posse in Divino Vero esse, nam per `montem Sinai' significatur caelum unde revelatio Divini Veri, videatur n. 8805, 8931, 9420, 10605; et per Moschen repraesentatur 
externum Ecclesiae, cultus, et Verbi, quod recipit Divinum Verum; quod gens Israelitica intelligatur, patet, nam de illa dicatur quod `non quisquam ascendet {1}tecum,' et quod nec `quisquam videbitur 
in toto monte.' 	[2] Quod Moscheh hic repraesentet externum Verbi, Ecclesiae, et cultus, quod recipit Divinum Verum, constat ex singulis in hoc capite, ut quod Moscheh ascenderet in montem Sinai 
et consisteret ibi in capite ejus, et quod populus {2}removeretur inde; in sequentibus etiam loquitur Jehovah ad Moschen, ut ad illum, et non ad populum, ut vers. 10, Videbit omnis populus, cujus tu 
in (x)medio ejus, quod mirabile hoc quod Ego faciens tecum:  vers. 11, {3} `Custodi tibi id quod Ego praecipio tibi hodie; ecce Ego expellens a faciebus tuis:  vers. 12, Cave tibi ne forte pangas foedus 
habitatori terrae, super quam tu venis:  vers. 14, Non incurvabis te deo alteri:  vers. 15, Ne forte pangas foedus habitatori terrae, et vocet te, et comedas de sacrificio ejus:  {4}vers. 16, Non accipias 
de filiabus ejus filiis tuis:  et sic porro; et dein quod cutis faciei Moschis coruscaret, et quod populus timeret accedere ad illum; et quod ideo daret super faciem velamen cum loqueretur cum 
populo.  Ex quibus patet quod Moscheh in hoc capite repraesentet externum Verbi, Ecclesiae, et cultus, quod recipit Divinum Verum, ita per quod Divinum Verum internum translucet.  Quod Moscheh repraesentet 
externum {5}illud et non internum, etiam patet ex singulis in hoc capite, ut quod descenderit Jehovah in nube, et constiterit cum eo, per `nubem' enim significatur externum Verbi; et dein quod 
Jehovah praeceperit illi externa Ecclesiae et cultus, quae {6}observarentur, et non interna.  Simile externum repraesentatum est per Moschen in capite praecedente, ut patet a versibus 7-11, et a vers. 
17-23, videatur n. 10563, 10570; at externum quod non recepit internum, erat apud gentem Israeliticam. @1 cum Mosche$ @2 prorsus removebitur [removeretur intended]$ @3 i Cave$ @4 et sic porro$ @5
