<h3 align="center" class="ired">属天的奥秘 第5462节</h3>
<h4 align="center"></h4><p><strong>5462.</strong>“但你们可以去，带着谷子救你们家里的饥荒”表在此期间，他们可以自由地为自己考虑。这从“你们可以去”、“谷子”、“饥荒”和“你们家”的含义清楚可知：他们被囚，并且他们当中的一个代替他们被囚之后，“你们可以去”是指在此期间，他们是自由的；“谷子”是指真理（参看<a href="5276.htm">5276</a>，<a href="5280.htm">5280</a>，<a href="5292.htm">5292</a>节）；“饥荒”是指认知或知识的缺乏，以及荒凉（<a href="5360.htm">5360</a>，<a href="5376.htm">5376</a>节）；“你们家”是指具体的每种真理所在的居所，因而是指属世心智。因为“家”（或房子，屋子）表示属世心智（参看<a href="4973.htm">4973</a>，<a href="5023.htm">5023</a>节）；此处由“雅各的儿子们”所代表的真理就是外在教会所知的那些真理，因而是指属世层中的真理（<a href="5401.htm">5401</a>，<a href="5415.htm">5415</a>，<a href="5428.htm">5428</a>节）。所有这些含义集合起来就可以看出，“带着谷子救你们家里的饥荒”表示以便考虑他们自己，以及他们所在的真理的荒凉。</p>

<p align="center"><b>Potts(1905-1910) 5462</b></p><p><b>5462.</b>
And go ye, bring produce for the famine of your houses. That this signifies that in the meantime they are free to look out for themselves, is evident from the signification of "go ye," after their being 
bound and one of them being held in their stead, as being that in the meantime they were free; from the signification of "produce," as being truth (see n. 5276, 5280, 5292); from the signification 
of "famine," as being a lack of knowledges and desolation (n. 5360, 5376); and from the signification of "your houses," as being the abodes where were the truths of each in particular, thus the natural 
mind. (That a "house" denotes the natural mind may be seen above, n. 4973, 5023; and that the truths here represented by the sons of Jacob are of the external church, thus in the natural, n. 5401, 
5415, 5428.) From these significations taken together it is evident that by "bringing produce for the famine of your houses" is signified that in the desolation of truth in which they are, they may look 
out for themselves and their own. </p>

<p align="center"><b>Elliott(1983-1999) 5462</b></p><p><b>5462.</b>
'And you, go, take corn for the famine of your houses' means that in the meantime they will be left in freedom to consider their own interests. This is clear from the meaning of 'you, go', after they 
had been held in bonds and one was then kept back in place of them, as their being left in freedom in the meantime; from the meaning of 'corn' as truth, dealt with in <a href="5276.htm">5276</a>, <a href="5280.htm">5280</a>, <a href="5292.htm">5292</a>; from the meaning 
of 'the famine' as an absence of cognitions and a desolation, dealt with in <a href="5360.htm">5360</a>, <a href="5376.htm">5376</a>; and from the meaning of 'your houses' as the dwelling-places where specifically truths of every kind reside, 
namely the natural mind. For 'a house' is the natural mind, see <a href="4973.htm">4973</a>, <a href="5023.htm">5023</a>, and the truths represented by 'the sons of Jacob' here, are those known to the external Church, and so are truths in the natural, <a href="5401.htm">5401</a>, <a href="5415.htm">5415</a>, <a href="5428.htm">5428</a>. From all these meanings taken together one may see that 'take corn for the famine of your houses' means so as to consider their own interests amid the desolation of truth in which 
they find themselves. </p>

</p><b>5462.</b>
`(x)Et vos ite, adducite annonam famis domuum vestrarum': quod significet quod illis interea liberum ut sibi consulant, constat (c)ex significatione `vos ite', postquam vincti fuerunt, et `loco illorum 
unus detentus' quod sit quod illis interea liberum; ex significatione annonae' quod sit verum, de qua n. 5276, 5280, 5292; ex significatione `famis' quod sit defectus cognitionum et desolatio, de 
qua n. 5360, 5376; et ex significatione `domuum vestrarum' quod sint habitationes ubi in specie cujus vis vera, ita mens naturalis; quod `domus' sit mens naturalis, videatur n. 4973, 5023, et quod vera 
quae per `filios Jacobi' hic repraesentantur, sint Ecclesiae externae, ita in naturali, n. 5401, 5415, 5428; ex his simul sumptis constare potest quod per `adducite annonam famis domuum vestrarum' significetur 
ut in desolatione veri in qua sunt, sibi et suis consulant. </p>
