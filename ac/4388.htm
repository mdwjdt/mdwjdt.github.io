Verses 17-20. And Jacob journeyed to Succoth, and built him a house, and made booths for his acquisition; therefore he called the name of the place Succoth. And Jacob came to Shalem, a city of Shechem, 
which is in the land of Canaan, when he came thither from Paddan-aram, and encamped to the faces of the city. And he bought the portion of the field, where he had stretched his tent, from the hand 
of the sons of Hamor, Shechem's father, for a hundred kesitah. And he erected there an altar, and he called it El Elohe Israel. "And Jacob journeyed to Succoth," signifies the state of the life of good 
from truth at that time; "and built him a house," signifies the increase of good from truth in that state; "and made booths for his acquisition," signifies likewise of those things which are in general, 
an increase in good from truth then; "therefore he called the name of the place Succoth," signifies the quality of this state; "and Jacob came to Shalem, a city of Shechem," signifies the interior 
truths of faith which are of tranquillity; "which is in the land of Canaan," signifies in the Lord's kingdom; "when he came thither from Paddan-aram" signifies after the former state; "and encamped 
to the faces of the city," signifies application; "and he bought the portion of the field," signifies the appropriation of good from that truth; "where he had stretched his tent," signifies what is holy; 
"from the hand of the sons of Hamor, Shechem's father," signifies the origin of that truth from a Divine stock from another source; "for a hundred kesitah," signifies what is full; "and he erected 
there an altar," signifies interior worship; "and he called it El Elohe Israel," signifies that it was from the Divine Spiritual. </p>

Verses 17-20 And Jacob travelled on to Succoth, and built a house for himself, and made booths for his cattle; therefore he called the name of the place Succoth. And Jacob came to Salem, the city of 
Shechem, which is in the land of Canaan, as he was coming from Paddan Aram; and he encamped towards the face of the city. And he bought the portion of the field where he had stretched his tent, from the 
hand of the sons of Hamor, the father of Shechem, for a hundred kesitahs. And he set up an altar there and called it El Elohe Israel. </p>
<p>'Jacob travelled on to Succoth' means the state of the life 
of the good from truth at that time. 'And built a house for himself' means an increase of good from truth within that state 'And made booths for his cattle' means an increase in a similar way of the things 
which exist in general within good from truth at that time 'Therefore he called the name of the place Succoth' means the nature of that state. 'And Jacob came to Salem, the city of Shechem' means 
interior truths of faith which go with a state of serenity 'Which is in the land of Canaan' means within the Lord's kingdom. 'As he was coming from Paddan Aram' means that which happened after the previous 
state. 'And he encamped towards the face of the city' means application. 'And he bought the portion of the field' means making the good that springs from that truth its own. 'Where he had stretched 
his tent' means holiness. 'From the hand of the sons of Hamor, the father of Shechem' means that the origin of that truth lay in a Divine stock from a different source. 'A hundred kesitahs' means 
that which is complete. 'And he set up an altar there' means interior worship. 'And called it El Elohe Israel' means that it originated in the Divine Spiritual. </p>

Vers. 17-20.  Et Jacob profectus ad Succoth, et aedificavit sibi domum, et acquisitioni suae fecit tuguria, propterea vocavit nomen loci Succoth. Et venit Jacob Shalem, urbem Shechemi, quae in terra 
Canaan, in veniendo eo e Paddan-Aram, et castrametatus ad facies urbis.  Et emit portionem agri, ubi tetendit tentorium suum, e manu filiorum Hamoris patris Shechemi, centum kesitis.  Et statuit 
ibi altare, et vocavit id El Elohe Israel. `Jacob profectus ad Succoth' significat statum vitae boni a vero tunc: `et aedificavit sibi domum' significat incrementum boni a vero in illo statu: `et 
acquisitioni suae fecit tuguria' significat similiter illorum quae in communi, bono a vero tunc: `propterea vocavit nomen loci Succoth' significat quale ejus status: `et venit Jacob Shalem, urbem 
Shechemi' significat interiora vera fidei quae tranquillitatis: `quae in terra Canaan' significat in regno Domini:  `in veniendo eo e Paddan-Aram' significat post statum priorem: `et castrametatus 
ad facies urbis' significat applicationem: `et emit portionem agri, significat appropriationem boni ex illo vero: `ubi tetendit tentorium suum' significat sanctum: `e manu filiorum Hamoris patris Shechemi' 
significat originem illius veri a stirpe Divina aliunde: `centum kesitis' significat plenum {1}: `et statuit ibi altare' significat cultum interiorem: `et vocavit id El Elohe Israel' significat 
quod a Divino Spirituali.      @1 A d multum, i plenum, see n. 4400.$ </p>
