<h4 align="center"></h4><p><strong>1485.</strong>“法老因这妇人就厚待亚伯兰”表主的知识增多。这从“厚待”表富有的含义清楚可知。这论及“法老”所表示的知识，因为厚待亚伯兰就是厚待孩童时的主。这是为了她的缘故，也就是为了祂所渴望的智性真理的缘故。正是对真理的渴望带来富有。</p><br />

Cooper(2008,2013)</b></p>
<p><strong>[NCE]1485.</strong> And he was good to Abram on her account means that the number of facts the Lord knew multiplied, as can be seen from the symbolism of being good to anyone as enriching that person.<br />It is the secular knowledge symbolized by Pharaoh that is being said to have benefited Abram, or in other words, to have benefited the Lord when he was young. What is more, it benefited him on her account, that is, on account of intuitive truth, which he desired. The desire for truth was what enriched him. </p>
<p align="center"><b>Potts(1905-1910) 1485</b></p><p><b>1485.</b>
And he did well unto Abram for her sake. That this signifies that memory-knowledges were multiplied with the Lord, is evident from the signification of "doing well unto," as being to enrich. This is 
said of the memory-knowledge that is signified by "Pharaoh," that it did well unto Abram, that is to the Lord when a child; and this for her sake, that is, for the sake of the intellectual truth that 
He desired. It was this desire for truth from which the enriching came. </p>

<p align="center"><b>Elliott(1983-1999) 1485</b></p><p><b>1485.</b>
That 'he treated Abram well for her sake' means that the facts residing with the Lord were multiplied is clear from the meaning of 'treating well' as enriching. This is said in reference to knowledge, 
meant by 'Pharaoh', in that it 'treated Abram well', that is, was a benefit to the Lord when a boy, and was so 'for her sake', that is, for the sake of the intellectual truth which He desired. It was 
this desire for truth that caused the enriching. </p>

<p align="center"><b>Latin(1748-1756) 1485</b>
</p><b>1485.</b>
'Et Abramo benefecit propter illam': quod significet quod scientifica apud Dominum multiplicata sint, constat ex significatione 'benefacere' quod sit locupletari: praedicatur hoc de scientia quae significatur 
per 'Pharaonem,' quod benefecerit 'Abramo,' hoc est, Domino puero, et hoc 'propter illam' hoc est, propter verum intellectuale quod desideravit; desiderium veri erat, ex quo locupletatio. </p>
