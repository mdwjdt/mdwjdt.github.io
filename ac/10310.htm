<h3 align="center" class="ired">属天的奥秘 第10310节</h3>
<h4 align="center"></h4><p><strong>10310</strong>.“这人要从他民中剪除”表与天堂和教会的分离，以及属灵的死亡。这从“从民中剪除”的含义清楚可知，“从民中剪除”是指分离和属灵的死亡（参看<a href="10288.htm">10288</a>节）。它是与天堂的一种分离，这一点从刚才的说明（<a href="10309.htm">10309</a>节）清楚看出来；它之所以也是与教会的一种分离，是因为唯独那些拥有教会在里面的人才是真正的教会成员，而拥有教会在里面的，是那些为了真理的缘故而拥有对真理的情感，为了良善的缘故而拥有对良善的情感之人，因而是那些处于对邻之爱和对神之爱的人。事实上，良善和真理就是邻舍，因而是神，因为良善和真理是神的，因而是与这种人同在的神。那些不具此特征的人不是真正的教会成员，哪怕他们可能就在教会中。</p>

Shall be cut off from his peoples. That this signifies separation from heaven and the church, and spiritual death, is evident from the signification of being "cut off from the peoples," as being separation 
and spiritual death (see n. 10288); that it denotes separation from heaven is evident from what was said just above (n. 10309); that it also denotes separation from the church is because those 
alone are of the church in whom the church is; and the church is in those who are in the affection of truth for the sake of truth, and in the affection of good for the sake of good, thus who are in love 
toward the neighbor and in love to God; for the neighbor is good and truth, and also is God, because good and truth are of God, thus are God with them. They who are not of this character are not of 
the church, no matter how much they may be in the church. </p>

<p align="center"><b>Elliott(1983-1999) 10310</b></p><p><b>10310.</b>
'Will be cut off from his people' means separation from heaven and the Church, and spiritual death. This is clear from the meaning of 'being cut off from his people' as separation and spiritual death, 
dealt with in <a href="10288.htm">10288</a>. The fact that it is a separation from heaven is clear from what has been stated immediately above in <a href="10309.htm">10309</a>; and the reason why it is a separation from the Church as well is that 
they alone are true members of the Church who have the Church within them, and they have the Church within them who have an affection for truth for its own sake and an affection for good for its own 
sake, thus who are governed by love towards the neighbour and love to God. For good and truth are the neighbour, and so is God since good and truth are God's and so are God as He exists with such people. 
Those who are not like this are not true members of the Church, even though they may be within the Church.  </p>

</p><b>10310.</b>
`Et exscindetur e populis suis' quod significet separationem e caelo et Ecclesia, ac mortem spiritualem, constat ex significatione `exscindi e populis' quod sit separatio et mors spiritualis, de qua 
n. (x)10,288; quod sit separatio e caelo, constat ex illis quae nunc supra n. 10,309 dicta sunt; quod etiam ex Ecclesia, est quia illi solum ab Ecclesia sunt, in quibus Ecclesia, et in illis est Ecclesia, 
qui in affectione veri propter verum ac in affectione boni propter bonum sunt, ita qui in amore erga proximum et in amore in Deum sunt; proximus enim est bonum et verum, et quoque est Deus, quoniam 
bonum et verum sunt Dei, ita sunt Deus apud illos. Qui tales non sunt, nec ab Ecclesia sunt, utcumque in Ecclesia. </p>
