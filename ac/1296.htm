<h4 align="center"></h4><p><strong>1296.</strong>“来吧，我们要作砖”表他们为自己制造虚假。这从“砖”的含义明显可知。在圣言中，“石头”表真理，因此，“砖”因是人造的，故表虚假，因为砖是人造的石头。“砖”有这样的含义，可从以下经文进一步看出来。以赛亚书：<br />我整天伸手招呼那悖逆的百姓，他们随自己的意念行不善之道，在园中献祭，在砖上烧香。（以赛亚书<a href="http://39-27.cn/赛65.2.htm">65:2</a>-<a href="http://39-27.cn/赛65.3.htm">3</a>）<br />“在砖上烧香”表出于编造和虚假之物的敬拜；因此，经上说这些人“随自己的意念行走”。同一先知书：<br />以法莲和撒玛利亚的居民凭骄傲自大的心说，砖墙塌了，我们却要凿石头建筑。（以赛亚书<a href="http://39-27.cn/赛9.9.htm">9:9</a>-<a href="http://39-27.cn/赛9.10.htm">10</a>）<br />“以法莲”表误入歧途、视假或“砖头”为真的聪明人。“凿石头”表编造之物。那鸿书：<br />你要打水预备受困，要坚固你的保障，踹土和泥，修补砖窑。在那里火必烧灭你，刀必杀戮你。（那鸿书<a href="http://39-27.cn/鸿3.14.htm">3:14</a>-<a href="http://39-27.cn/鸿3.15.htm">15</a>）<br />此处“踹土”表虚假，“修补砖窑”表基于它们的敬拜。“火”是对恶欲的惩罚，“刀”是对虚假的惩罚。以西结书：<br />你要拿一块砖摆在你面前，将一座耶路撒冷城刻在其上。（以西结书<a href="http://39-27.cn/结4.1.htm">4:1</a>）<br />他还受命围攻它，其中所预言的事就暗示这敬拜被歪曲。“砖”表虚假，这从“石头”的含义进一步看出来，稍后将论述，“石头”表真理。</p>

<p><strong>[NCE]1296.</strong> The symbolism of come, let us make bricks, as the falsities that they would invent for themselves can be seen from the symbolism of brick. In the Word, stone symbolizes truth. So brick, as a human product, symbolizes falsity, since it is artificial, manufactured stone. This symbolism of brick can also be seen from the following passages. In Isaiah:<br />I have spread my hands out all day to a defiant people walking on a path that is not good, in pursuit of their own thoughts, sacrificing in gardens and offering incense on bricks. (<a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_1296/bible_king-james-version_isaiah_65_2-3" target=_top>Isaiah 65:2-3</a>)<br />To offer incense on bricks is to base one's worship on fictions and falsity, which is why the people are said to be pursuing their own thoughts. In the same author:<br />... on account of haughtiness and pride of heart in Ephraim and in the resident of Samaria, who say, "Bricks have fallen, and we will build with carved stone." (<a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_1296/bible_king-james-version_isaiah_9_9-10" target=_top>Isaiah 9:9-10</a>)<br />Ephraim stands for a discerning person who has sunk into corrupt ways, who calls truth falsity or turns truth into falsity, falsity being the bricks. Carved stone stands for a fabrication. In Nahum:<br />Draw water for the siege for yourselves; shore up your strongholds; go into the clay and tread mortar; repair the brick kiln. There fire will consume you and the sword will cut you off. (<a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_1296/bible_king-james-version_nahum_3_14-15" target=_top>Nahum 3:14-15</a>)<br />The treading of mortar stands for falsity; repairing the brick kiln, for worship based on falsity. Fire is the penalty exacted by corrupt desire; a sword, the penalty incurred by false thinking. In Ezekiel:<br />Take yourself a brick and put it in front of you, and carve the city of Jerusalem on it. (<a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_1296/bible_king-james-version_ezekiel_4_1" target=_top>Ezekiel 4:1</a>)<br />Then comes a command to lay siege to it. This prophetic act involves the idea that worship has been falsified.<br />The symbolism of brick as falsity stands out even more clearly from the symbolism of stone as truth, to be dealt with just below. </p>
<p align="center"><b>Potts(1905-1910) 1296</b></p><p><b>1296.</b>
Come, let us make bricks. That this signifies falsities which they fashioned for themselves, is evident from the signification of "brick." In the Word, "stone" signifies truth, and therefore "brick," 
because it is made by man, signifies falsity; for brick is stone artificially made. That "brick" has this signification may be further seen from the following passages. In Isaiah: </p>
<p>     I have spread 
out My hands all the day unto a refractory people, that walk in a way that is not good, after their own thoughts, sacrificing in gardens, and burning incense upon bricks (Isa. 65:2-3). "Burning incense 
upon bricks" denotes worship from things fabricated and false; and therefore they are said to walk after their own thoughts. Again: </p>
<p>     For the elation and pride of heart of Ephraim and of the inhabitant 
of Samaria, that say, The bricks have fallen down, but we will build with hewn stone (Isa. 9:9-10). "Ephraim" denotes an intelligent person who falls into perversities, and calls or makes to 
be true things that are false, or "bricks;" "hewn stone" denotes what is fabricated. In Nahum: </p>
<p>     Draw thee water for the siege, strengthen thy fortresses, go into the mud and tread the clay, repair 
the brick kiln. There shall the fire devour thee, and the sword shall cut thee off (Nahum 3:14-15). Here "to tread the clay" denotes falsities; "to repair the brick kiln denotes the derivative worship; 
"the fire" is the punishment of cupidities; "the sword" is the punishment of falsities. In Ezekiel: </p>
<p>     Take thee a brick, and set it before thee, and grave upon it a city, even Jerusalem (Ezek. 
4:1); </p>
<p>and he was commanded to besiege it, in which prophetic matter there is involved that the worship was falsified. That "brick" signifies falsity, may be still further seen from the signification 
of "stone," which is truth, concerning which presently. </p>

<p align="center"><b>Elliott(1983-1999) 1296</b></p><p><b>1296.</b>
That 'come, let us make bricks' means the falsities which they fashioned for themselves is clear from the meaning of 'brick'. 'Stone' in the Word means truth, and therefore 'brick', being man-made, means 
falsity, for brick is artificial stone. That 'brick' has this meaning becomes clear also from the following places: In Isaiah, </p>
<blockquote>
I have spread out My hands all the day to a rebellious people. walking 
in a way that is not good, after their own thoughts, sacrificing in gardens and burning incense upon bricks. <a href="http://bible.gospelcom.net/cgi-bin/bible?passage=Isa%2065:2,%203&amp;version=ESV&amp;interface=print&amp;showfn=yes&amp;showxref">Isa 65:2, 3</a>. 
</blockquote>
<p>'Burning incense upon bricks' stands for worship based on fabrications 
and falsities; and this is why these people are referred to as 'walking after their own thoughts'. In the same prophet, </p>
<blockquote>
On account of the pace and arrogance of heart of Ephraim, and of the inhabitants 
of Samaria, saying, The bricks have fallen but we will build from hewn stone. <a href="http://bible.gospelcom.net/cgi-bin/bible?passage=Isa%209:9,%2010&amp;version=ESV&amp;interface=print&amp;showfn=yes&amp;showxref">Isa 9:9, 10</a>. 
</blockquote>
<p>'Ephraim' stands for one who, having become intelligent, has then lapsed into wrong, who calls or 
makes falsities, or 'bricks', his truths. 'Hewn stone' stands for what is a fabrication. In Nahum, </p>
<blockquote>
Draw yourself water for the siege, strengthen your fortifications; go into the mud and tread the clay; 
renew the brick-kiln. There the fire will devour you. and the sword cut you off. <a href="http://bible.gospelcom.net/cgi-bin/bible?passage=Nahum%203:14,%2015&amp;version=ESV&amp;interface=print&amp;showfn=yes&amp;showxref">Nahum 3:14, 15</a>. 
</blockquote>
<p>Here 'treading the clay' stands for falsities, 'renewing the brick-kiln' for worship based on them. 
'Fire' is the punishment of evil desires, 'sword' the punishment of falsities. In Ezekiel, </p>
<blockquote>
Take a brick and lay it before you, and on it carve the city of Jerusalem. <a href="http://bible.gospelcom.net/cgi-bin/bible?passage=Ezek%204:1&amp;version=ESV&amp;interface=print&amp;showfn=yes&amp;showxref">Ezek 4:1</a>. 
</blockquote>
<p>This text contains 
the command to besiege it, a prophecy implying that worship was falsified. The fact that 'brick' means falsity becomes clearer still from the meaning of 'stone' as truth, to be dealt with in what 
follows shortly. </p>

</p><b>1296.</b>
'Age laterificemus lateres': quod significet falsa quae sibi fingerent, constat ex significatione 'lateris'; 'lapis' in Verbo significat verum, inde 'later' quia factus ab homine, significat falsum, 
est enim later artificialiter factus lapis; quod 'later' id significet constare potest etiam ex his locis; apud Esaiam, 	Expandi manus Meas toto die ad populum refractarium: 	ambulantes via non bona 
post cogitationes suas,... sacrificantes in hortis, et suffientes super lateribus, lxv 	2, 3; </p>
<p>'suffire super lateribus' pro colere ex fictis et falsis, quare dicuntur 'ambulantes post cogitationes suas': 
apud eundem, 	Propter elationem et superbiam cordis Ephraimi, et habitatoris Samariae, dicendo, Lateres ceciderunt, et lapide caeso aedificabimus, ix 9, 10; </p>
<p>'Ephraim' pro intelligente qui in perversa 
lapsus, qui vera vocat aut facit falsa seu 'lateres'; 'lapis caesus' pro ficto: apud Nahum, 	Aquas obsidii hauri tibi, confirma munimenta tua, intra in caenum, et calca lutum, repara fornacem 
lateritiam; ibi comedet te ignis, et exscindet te gladius, iii 14, 15; </p>
<p>ibi 'calcare lutum' pro falsis, 'reparare fornacem lateritiam' pro cultu inde; 'ignis' est poena cupiditatum, 'gladius' est poena 
falsitatum: apud Ezechielem, 	Sume tibi laterem, et pone eum ante te, et sculpe super eum urbem Hierosolymam, iv 1; </p>
<p>ibi mandatum ut eam obsideret, in quo prophetico involvitur quo cultus falsificatus. 
 Quod 'later' significet falsum, adhuc constare potest a significatione 'lapidis' quod sit verum, de quo in mox sequentibus. </p>
