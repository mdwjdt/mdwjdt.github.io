<h3 align="center" class="ired">属天的奥秘 第8780节</h3>
<h4 align="center"></h4><p><strong>8780.</strong>“耶和华对摩西说”表神性通过从神来的真理的流注，是关于启示的。这从“说”的含义清楚可知，当论述来自神的启示时，“说”是指流注。除此之外，“说”在其它地方也表示流注（参看<a href="5743.htm">5743</a>，<a href="7291.htm">7291</a>，<a href="7381.htm">7381</a>，<a href="8221.htm">8221</a>，<a href="8262.htm">8262</a>，<a href="8660.htm">8660</a>节）；“耶和华”明显是指神性，就是启示所来自的源头；“摩西”也指从神来的真理，启示通过该真理而来（<a href="6771.htm">6771</a>，<a href="6827.htm">6827</a>，<a href="7014.htm">7014</a>节）。这是关于启示的流注，这一点从接下来的话明显可知，即：“耶和华要在密云中临到他们那里，叫百姓在我与你说话的时候可以听见，也可以永远信你了”，这些话表示启示及其性质。<br />此处启示在内义上不是指从西乃山上向以色列百姓所作的那种启示，也就是说，主以听得见的声音说话，百姓站在周围都听见了。相反，它是指一种不是以听得见的声音作出，而是被人从内在接受的启示。当一个处于对源于良善的真理的情感之人正在阅读圣言时，这种启示便通过光照内在视觉，也就是理解力而作出。那时，这种光照是由天堂之光带来的，这光从在天堂显为太阳的主流出。这光光照理解力的方式，与外在视觉，也就是眼睛的视觉被从世间太阳所流出的光光照的方式几乎一样。当理解力被这神性之光光照时，它就会感知到真理就是真理，从内在承认它，可以说看见它。这就是那些处于对源于良善的真理的情感之人在阅读圣言时所受的启示。<br />但那些处于对源于邪恶的真理的情感之人，也就是那些纯粹为了重要职位、金钱利益、名声等等而想知道真理的人则看不见真理，只看见那些确认其教会教义事物的事物，无论这些事物是真假。那时，光照这些人的光不是来自天堂的神性之光，而是一种诸如地狱里的人也拥有的一种感官之光；天堂之光一出现，这光就会变成纯粹、完全的黑暗。因为当这些人阅读圣言时，他们完全无视不符合他们教义的真理。例如，当那些认为救恩在于唯信的人阅读圣言时，他们根本不理会圣言所说关于爱与仁的话；甚至看不见它们，因为这些话落在他们视野的阴影中，就像在十分边远或人背后的事物。犹太民族就是这个样子，这个民族把自己置于全世界其它所有民族之上，看不出主就是众先知所指的那一位，无论这话说得说得多么清楚。<br />原因在于，他们只看见确认他们自己关于弥赛亚的教义之物，即：祂要作为一个威武的英雄而来，施行比摩西更大的神迹，把他们领到迦南地；届时，他们都将大放异彩、气势凌人，垂听抓住他们衣襟加入他们的外邦人的呼求。由于这些就是构成他们教导的观念，所以他们看不见关于主的任何东西；关于主的任何事对他们来说，都如同幽暗。其它一切错误也都是这种情况。由此可见就来自圣言的真理的启示而言，情况是什么样。</p>

And Jehovah said unto Moses. That this signifies the influx of the Divine through truth from the Divine concerning revelation, is evident from the signification of "saying," when revelation from the 
Divine is treated of, as being influx (that "saying" in other passages also denotes influx, see n. 5743, 7291, 7381, 8221, 8262, 8660); that "Jehovah" denotes the Divine from which is revelation, is manifest; 
and also that "Moses" denotes truth from the Divine through which is revelation (n. 6771, 6827, 7014); that the influx is concerning revelation, is evident from what follows, namely, that "Jehovah 
will come unto them in the density of the cloud, that the people may hear when I speak with thee, and may also believe in thee to eternity," by which words is signified revelation and its quality. [2] 
By revelation here in the internal sense is not meant revelation such as was made to the Israelitish people from Mount Sinai, namely, that the Lord spoke in a loud voice, and the people standing 
around heard; but such a revelation is meant as is not made with a loud voice, but inwardly in man. This revelation is made by the enlightening of the internal sight, which is of the understanding, 
when a man who is in the affection of truth from good is reading the Word. This enlightening is then effected by the light of heaven, which is from the Lord as the sun there. By this light the understanding 
is enlightened no otherwise than is the external sight, which is of the eye, by the light which is from the sun of the world. When the understanding is enlightened by that Divine light, it then 
perceives that to be true which is true, it acknowledges it inwardly in itself, and as it were sees it. Such is the revelation of those who are in the affection of truth from good when they are reading 
the Word. [3] But they who are in the affection of truth from evil, that is, who desire to know truths merely for the sake of honors, gain, reputation, and the like, these do not see truths, but 
only see things which confirm the doctrinal things of their church, whether they are true or false. The light which then enlightens these is not Divine light from heaven, but is a sensuous light such 
as is that of the infernals, which light becomes mere thick darkness at the presence of heavenly light. For when these read the Word, they are altogether blind to the truth which does not make one with 
their doctrine; as for example when they who make salvation consist in faith alone read the Word, they do not attend at all to those things which are there said about love and charity; nay, they do 
not see them, because they fall into the shade of their vision, like things which are quite at the side, or like those which are behind them; in like manner as the Jewish nation, which sets itself above 
all other nations in the whole world, does not see that the Lord is He who is meant in the prophets, however plainly this is told. [4] The reason is, that they see only what confirms their own teaching 
concerning the Messiah, that He is to come as a mighty hero, to do greater miracles than Moses did, and to bring them into the land of Canaan, and that they will all then go with magnificent pomp, 
hearing the supplications of the Gentiles, who will lay hold of the skirts of their garments to accompany them. As all this belongs to their teaching, they do not see anything in regard to the Lord; 
but it is to them like thick darkness. Such is the case with all other errors. From all this it can be seen how the case is with the revelation of truth from the Word. </p>

'And Jehovah said to Moses' means an influx of the Divine through the truth from God, regarding revelation. This is clear from the meaning of 'saying', when it refers to revelation coming from God, as 
influx. 'Saying' in other places besides this means influx, see <a href="5743.htm">5743</a>, <a href="7291.htm">7291</a>, <a href="7381.htm">7381</a>, <a href="8221.htm">8221</a>, <a href="8262.htm">8262</a>, <a href="8660.htm">8660</a>; 'Jehovah' is plainly the Divine, the source from which the revelation comes; and 'Moses' is the truth 
from God, the means through which it comes, <a href="6771.htm">6771</a>, <a href="6827.htm">6827</a>, <a href="7014.htm">7014</a>. The fact that it is an influx regarding revelation is clear from what follows, that is to say, from the declaration that Jehovah is going 
to come to them in the thickness of a cloud, in order that the people may hear when I speak to you, and also will believe in you forever, words meaning revelation and the essential nature of it. </p>
<p></p>
<p><b>[2]</b>
Revelation here does not mean in the internal sense the kind of revelation made to the Israelite people from Mount Sinai, that is to say, when the Lord spoke with an audible voice and the people 
standing round heard it. Rather it means a revelation that is not made with an audible voice but is received by a person inwardly. This revelation is made through enlightenment of inner sight, which 
is the understanding, when a person with an affection for truth springing from good reads the Word. That enlightenment is brought about by the light of heaven, which flows from the Lord as the Sun there. 
That light enlightens the understanding in much the same way as outward sight, which is that of the eye, is enlightened by the light which flows from the sun in the world. When the understanding is 
enlightened by that Divine light it perceives that to be the truth which is the truth, inwardly acknowledges it, and so to speak sees it. This is what the revelation is like which is received by those 
with an affection for truth springing from good, when they read the Word. </p>
<p></p>
<p><b>[3]</b>
 But those with an affection for truth springing from evil - that is, those who wish to know truths solely for the sake 
of important positions, monetary gain, reputation, and the like - do not see truths. All they see are corroborations of things taught by their Church, whether those things are true or false. The light 
which enlightens them then is not Divine light from heaven; instead it is the light belonging to the senses, such as those in hell also possess, a light which becomes complete and utter darkness at 
the presence of heavenly light. When these people read the Word they are altogether blind to truth if it does not make one with their religious teachings. When for example those who make salvation consist 
in faith alone read the Word they pay no attention whatever to the things said there about love and charity; they do not even see them since those things fall within the obscured parts of their 
field of vision, like objects well off to the side or behind one's back. It is much the same with the Jewish nation, which sets itself up above all others in the whole world. They do not see that the 
Lord is the One who is meant in the Prophets, no matter how plainly this may be stated. </p>
<p><b>[4]</b>
 The reason why is that they see nothing except corroborations of their teachings about the Messiah, which are 
that He is going to come as a mighty hero, perform greater miracles than Moses, and lead them into the land of Canaan, at which time they are all going to proceed in grandeur, listening to the appeals 
made by gentiles taking hold of the hem of their garments to let them join their company. Since these are the ideas that compose what they teach they see nothing whatever regarding the Lord; anything 
regarding Him is to them as thick darkness. The situation is the same with all other errors. All this goes to show what the situation is so far as the revelation of truth from the Word is concerned. </p>

`Et dixit Jehovah ad Moschen': quod significet influxum Divini per verum a Divino de revelatione, constat ex significatione `dicere' cum agitur de revelatione a Divino, quod sit influxus; quod `dicere' 
etiam alibi sit influxus, videatur n. 5743, 7291, 7381, 8221, 8262, 8660; quod `Jehovah' sit Divinum a quo revelatio, patet; et quod `Moscheh' sit verum a Divino, per quod illa, n. 6771, 6827, 7014; 
quod sit influxus de revelatione, constat ex illis quae sequuntur, quod nempe Jehovah venturus ad illos in densitate nubis, propterea ut audiat populus in loquendo Me tecum, et etiam in te credent 
in aeternum, per quae verba significatur revelatio et quale ejus. 	2 Per revelationem hic in sensu interno non intelligitur revelatio qualis facta {1} populo Israelitico e monte Sinai, quod nempe Dominus 
locutus sonora voce, et populus circumstans audiverit, sed intelligitur revelatio quae non fit sonora voce, verum intus in homine; haec revelatio fit per illustrationem visus interni, qui est intellectus, 
cum homo qui in affectione veri ex bono est legit Verbum; illustratio illa tunc fit a luce caeli, quae {1} a Domino ut sole ibi; a luce illa illustratur intellectus non aliter {2}ac visus externus, 
qui est oculi, a luce quae a sole mundi; cum intellectus a luce illa Divina illustratur, tunc percipit ille id verum esse quod verum est, agnoscit id intus in se, et quasi videt id; talis est 
revelatio illorum qui in affectione veri ex bono sunt, cum legunt Verbum; at qui in affectione veri ex malo sunt, hoc est, {3} solum propter honores, lucrum, famam, et similia, cupiunt scire vera, illi 
non vident illa sed modo vident confirmantia doctrinalium Ecclesiae suae, sive vera sint sive falsa; lux illa quae tunc illustrat non est lux Divina e caelo, sed est lux sensualis qualis etiam est infernalium, 
quae lux ad praesentiam lucis caelestis fit mera caligo; hi enim cum legunt Verbum, caecutiunt prorsus ad verum quod non cum doctrinali unum facit; sicut pro exemplo: qui in fide sola ponunt 
salvationem, {4}cum legunt Verbum, prorsus nihil attendunt ad illa quae de amore et charitate {5}ibi dicuntur, immo nec vident illa, nam cadunt in visus umbram sicut quae plane a latere vel sicut quae 
a tergo sunt; similiter ac gens Judaica, quae se reliquis in universo terrarum orbe praefert, nec videt quod Dominus sit Qui intelligitur apud 4 prophetas, utcumque hoc manifeste dicitur; causa est 
quia non vident nisi confirmantia sui doctrinalis de Messia, quod venturus ut magnus heros, facturus prae Moscheh miracula, ac introducturus illos in terram Canaanem, et quod tunc cum magnifica pompa 
omnes ituri, audientes supplicationes gentium, quae alas vestium illorum prehensurae sint, de comitatu; haec quia sunt doctrinalis illorum, non vident quicquam de Domino {6}; hoc illis est sicut caligo; 
ita se habet cum ceteris erroribus.  Ex his constare potest quomodo se habet cum revelatione veri ex Verbo. 	@1 i est$ 	@2 quam$ 	@3 qui$ 	@4 legunt quidem, sed usque$ 	@5 tam copiose in Verbo$ 	@6 i ibi$ </p>
