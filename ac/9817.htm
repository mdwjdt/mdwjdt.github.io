<h3 align="center" class="ired">属天的奥秘 第9817节</h3>
<h4 align="center"></h4><p><strong>9817.</strong>“又要对一切心中有智慧的说”表主通过圣言进入所有处于爱之良善之人的流注。这从“说”和“心中有智慧的”的含义清楚可知：“说”是指流注（参看<a href="2951.htm">2951</a>，<a href="5481.htm">5481</a>，<a href="5743.htm">5743</a>，<a href="5797.htm">5797</a>，<a href="7270.htm">7270</a>节）；“心中有智慧的”是指那些处于爱之良善的人，如下文所述。之所以表示经由圣言来自主的流注，是因为对教会成员来说，主流入所经由的渠道是圣言，或说主主要通过圣言流入。原因在于，圣言具有这样的性质：那里的一切事物，无一例外，都对应于存在于天堂中的神性属灵和神性属天事物；因此，一个人与天使共享情感和思维，并且共享得如此彻底，以致他与天使似乎为一。正因如此，世界通过圣言与天堂联结，不过只在那些处于信和爱之良善的人当中才可以。由此可见对教会成员来说，主通过圣言流入；事实上，主是众天堂中的全部，因为从祂发出并被天使接受的神性构成天堂。<br />“心中有智慧的”之所以表示那些处于爱之良善的人，是因为智慧在一个人里面的存在是由于他里面的天堂生命，还因为“心”表示爱之良善。在圣言中，人里面的天堂生命用“灵”和“心”来表述；“灵”表示人心智的理解力部分的生命，“心”表示其意愿部分的生命。真理属于理解力部分，而良善属于意愿部分；真理属于信，良善属于爱。因为理解力接受构成信的真理，意愿接受系爱的各个方面的良善。由此明显可知“心中有智慧的”表示那些处于从主所获得的爱之良善的人。爱之良善是属天良善，属灵良善通过属天良善得以产生；属灵良善就是那遮盖属天良善的东西，就像衣服遮盖身体那样。由于亚伦的衣服代表毗邻主之属天国度的主之属灵国度，并且前者通过后者得以产生，故本节接着说“心中有智慧的”，就是那些处于从主所获得的爱之良善的人要为亚伦和他的儿子作圣衣，如下文所述。“心”表示爱之良善，或属天良善（参看<a href="3635.htm">3635</a>，<a href="3880.htm">3880</a>，<a href="3883.htm">3883</a>-<a href="3896.htm">3896</a>，<a href="9050.htm">9050</a>节）；因此，它表示意愿（<a href="2930.htm">2930</a>，<a href="3888.htm">3888</a>，<a href="7542.htm">7542</a>，<a href="8910.htm">8910</a>，<a href="9113.htm">9113</a>，<a href="9300.htm">9300</a>，<a href="9495.htm">9495</a>节）。</p>

And thou shalt speak unto all the wise in heart. That this signifies the influx of the Lord through the Word into all who are in the good of love, is evident from the signification of "speaking," as 
being influx (see n. 2951, 5481, 5743, 5797, 7270); and from the signification of "the wise in heart," as being those who are in the good of love (of which in what follows). That the influx of the Lord 
through the Word is signified, is because the Lord flows in with the man of the church chiefly through the Word. The reason is that the Word is of such a nature that each and all things therein correspond 
to the Divine spiritual and Divine celestial things that are in the heavens; whence there is a communication of the affections and thoughts of man with the angels, insomuch that they are as it 
were a one. From this it is that the world is conjoined with heaven through the Word; but only with those who are in the good of faith and of love. From all this it can be seen that the influx of the 
Lord with the man of the church is through the Word; for in the heavens the Lord is everything, because the Divine which proceeds from Him and is received by the angels makes heaven. [2] The reason why 
"the wise in heart" denote those who are in the good of love, is that wisdom is predicated of the life of heaven in man, and also that by "the heart" is signified the good of love. The life of heaven 
in man is expressed in the Word by "spirit" and by "heart;" by "spirit" is meant the life of man's intellectual part, and by "heart" the life of his will part. To the intellectual part belongs truth, 
and to the will part belongs good. Truth belongs to faith, and good to love; for the understanding receives the truths which are of faith, and the will the goods which are of love. From this it is 
plain that by "the wise in heart" are signified those who are in the good of love from the Lord. The good of love is celestial good, through which is spiritual good; and spiritual good is that which covers 
celestial good, as garments cover the body. And as by the garments of Aaron was represented the spiritual kingdom of the Lord joined to His celestial kingdom, and the former comes forth through 
the latter, therefore it is here said that "the wise in heart," that is, they who are in the good of love from the Lord, "shall make the garments for Aaron and his sons" (as in what follows). (That "the 
heart" denotes the good of love, or celestial good, see n. 3635, 3880, 3883-3896, 9050; and that on this account it denotes the will, n. 2930, 3888, 7542, 8910, 9113, 9300, 9495.) </p>

'And you shall speak to all the wise at heart' means an influx from the Lord through the Word into all who are governed by the good of love. This is clear from the meaning of 'speaking' as influx, dealt 
with in <a href="2951.htm">2951</a>, <a href="5481.htm">5481</a>, <a href="5743.htm">5743</a>, <a href="5797.htm">5797</a>, <a href="7270.htm">7270</a>; and from the meaning of 'the wise at heart' as those who are governed by the good of love, dealt with below. The reason why influx from the Lord through the Word 
is meant is that for members of the Church the main channel by which the Lord flows in is the Word. This is so because the nature of the Word is such that all things without exception there correspond 
to the Divine spiritual and Divine celestial realities that exist in the heavens; and as a result of this a person shares affections and thoughts with angels, in so complete a manner that he and 
they are seemingly one. So it is that the world has been joined to heaven through the Word, but only among those who are governed by the good of faith and love. From all this it becomes clear that for 
members of the Church the Lord flows in through the Word; for the Lord is the all in the heavens, since what is Divine and emanates from the Lord, and is received by angels, composes heaven.  </p>

<p><b>[2]</b>
The reason why 'the wise at heart' means those who are governed by the good of love is that the presence of wisdom in a person is attributable to the life of heaven in him, also that 'heart' means the 
good of love. In the Word 'spirit' and 'heart' are expressions that have regard to the life of heaven present with a person, 'spirit' being used to mean that life in the understanding part of the person's 
mind and 'heart' that life in the will part. To the understanding part belongs truth, but to the will part belongs good; the former has to do with faith, but the latter with love. For the understanding 
receives truths that constitute faith, and the will forms of good that are aspects of love. From this it is evident that by 'the wise at heart' those governed by the good of love received from 
the Lord are meant. The good of love is celestial good, through which spiritual good comes into being; and spiritual good is that which covers celestial good, like garments the body. And since Aaron's 
garments represented the Lord's spiritual kingdom lying adjacent to His celestial kingdom, and the former comes into being through the latter, the present verse goes on to say that 'the wise at heart', 
that is, those governed by the good of love received from the Lord, should make the garments for Aaron and his sons. As regards 'heart', that it means the good of love or celestial good, see <a href="3635.htm">3635</a>, <a href="3880.htm">3880</a>, <a href="3883.htm">3883</a>-<a href="3896.htm">3896</a>, <a href="9050.htm">9050</a>; and that it therefore means the will, <a href="2930.htm">2930</a>, <a href="3888.htm">3888</a>, <a href="7542.htm">7542</a>, <a href="8910.htm">8910</a>, <a href="9113.htm">9113</a>, <a href="9300.htm">9300</a>, <a href="9495.htm">9495</a>.  </p>

`Et tu {1}loqueris ad omnes sapientes corde': quod significet influxum Domini per Verbum in omnes qui in bono amoris sunt constat `a significatione `loqui' quod sit influxus, de qua n. 2951, 5481, 5743, 
5797, 7270, et ex significatione `sapientum corde' quod sint qui in bono amoris, de qua sequitur; quod {2} significetur influxus Domini per Verbum, est quia Dominus apud hominem Ecclesiae per illud 
imprimis influit; causa est quia Verbum tale est ut omnia et singula ibi correspondeant Divinis spiritualibus et Divinis caelestibus {3}quae in caelis, inde communicatio affectionum et cogitationum 
hominis cum angelis, usque adeo ut quasi unum sint; inde est quod mundus {4}cum caelo conjunctus sit per Verbum, sed apud illos qui in bono fidei e amoris sunt; ex {5}quibus constare potest quod influxus 
Domini apud hominem Ecclesiae sit per Verbum, nam Dominus est omne in caelis Divinum enim procedens a Domino, et receptum ab angelis, {6} facit caelum. 	2 Quod `sapientes corde' sint qui in bono 
amoris sunt, (x)est qui: sapientia praedicatur de vita caeli apud hominem, {7}tum quia per cor significatur bonum amoris; vita caeli apud hominem exprimitur in Verbo per `spiritum' et per `cor'; per 
`spiritum' intelligitur vita parti intellectualis {8}, et per `cor' vita partis voluntariae {9}hominis; ad partem intellectualem pertinet verum, ad partem autem voluntariam pertinet bonum; illud est fidei, 
hoc autem est amoris, nam intellectus recipi vera quae sunt fidei, et voluntas bona quae sunt amoris; inde patet quod per `sapientes corde' significentur qui in bono amoris a Domino sunt; bonum 
amoris est bonum caeleste, per quod bonum spirituale et bonum spirituale est quod tegit bonum caeleste, sicut vestes corpus et quia per vestes Aharonis repraesentabatur regnum spirituale Domini adjunctum 
regno caelesti Ipsius, et illud per hoc existit, ideo hic dicitur quod sapientes corde, hoc est, qui in bono amoris {10}a Domino sunt, facerent vestes Aharoni et filiis ejus, ut sequitur. Quod `cor' 
sit bonum amoris seu bonum caeleste, videatur n. 3635, 3880, 3883-3896, 9050, et quod ideo sit voluntas, n. 2930, 3888, 7542, 8910, 9113, 9300, (x)9495. @1 loquere$ @2 i per loqui ad illos$ @3 in
