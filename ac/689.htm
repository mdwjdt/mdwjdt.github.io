<h3 align="center" class="ired">属天的奥秘 第689节</h3>
<h4 align="center"></h4><p>689．既如此，每一个事物，无论属天、属灵还是属世的，都是以这样的方式被平衡，所以没人能脱离多数人而思考、感觉或行动，尽管每个人都以为他是独立、绝对自由地这样做的。同样，任何事物若不被其对立面平衡就不会存在，而对立物则被中间事物所平衡。结果，独立的个体和集体的许多人共同生活在一个最完美的平衡中。所以，邪恶无论降临到谁的头上，都会立即被平衡。当邪恶占优势时，邪恶，即作恶者仿佛凭着自己被平衡的法则纠正过来，但这一切的发生只是为了良善可以产生。天堂的秩序就在于这样一种形式和由此产生的平衡中。唯独主形成、安排并保持这种秩序。</p>

<p><strong>[NCE]689.</strong> We are all, as a whole and as individuals, in such flawless balance at the heavenly, spiritual, and earthly levels that none of us can think, feel, or act unless inspired by many others. Yet each of us imagines that we act by ourselves in absolute freedom.<br />In a similar way, nothing ever exists that is not balanced by its opposite, and also by intermediate steps between them. So each of us by ourselves and numbers of us taken together live in the most perfect balance.<br />For this reason, nothing bad can happen to anyone without being immediately counterbalanced. When a surplus of evil accumulates, the evil or the person committing it is punished by the law of equilibrium — spontaneously, it seems. But this never occurs except in order that good may come out of it.<br />This pattern (and so this balance) constitutes the design of heaven, which the Lord alone shapes, arranges, and preserves to eternity. </p>
<p align="center"><b>Potts(1905-1910) 689</b></p><p><b>689.</b>
There is therefore an equilibrium of all and of each with respect to celestial, spiritual, and natural things, so that no one can think, feel, and act except from many, and yet everyone supposes that 
he does so of himself, most freely. In like manner there is nothing which is not balanced by its opposite, and opposites by intermediates, so that each by himself, and many together, live in most perfect 
equilibrium. And therefore no evil can befall anyone without being instantly counterbalanced; and when there is a preponderance of evil, the evil or evildoer is chastised by the law of equilibrium, 
as of himself, but solely for the end that good may come. Heavenly order consists in such a form and the consequent equilibrium; and that order is formed, disposed, and preserved by the Lord alone, 
to eternity. </p>

<p align="center"><b>Elliott(1983-1999) 689</b></p><p><b>689.</b>
This being so, every single thing - celestial, spiritual, or natural - is balanced in such a way that nobody is able to think, feel, or act in isolation from the many, though each one supposes that he 
does so independently and in absolute freedom. Nothing in like manner ever exists that is not counter-balanced by its opposite, and things that are opposite by those that are intermediate. As a result 
the individual by himself, and the many collectively, live in a most perfect equilibrium. Consequently no evil can befall anyone without being instantly counter-balanced. And when there is a preponderance 
of evil, evil - that is, the evil-doer - is in that case corrected by the law of equilibrium as if of himself; but this never takes place except to the end that good may result. Such is the form, 
and therefore the equilibrium in which heavenly order consists, an order formed, arranged, and preserved for ever by the Lord alone. </p>

<p align="center"><b>Latin(1748-1756) 689</b>
</p><b>689.</b>
Inde aequilibrium est omnium et singulorum quoad caelestia, spiritualia et naturalia, ut nullus cogitare, sentire, et agere possit nisi a pluribus; et usque unusquisque autumat quod liberrime a se: 
similiter nihil usquam datur quod non aequilibratur a suo opposito, et oppositi intermediis, sic ut unusquisque per se, et plures simul, vivant in perfectissimo aequilibrio: quare nec alicui malum accidere 
potest, quin ilico aequilibretur; et quando suprapondium est mali, tunc castigatur malum seu malus ex lege aequilibrii ut a semet, sed nusquam nisi ob finem ut inde bonum.  In tali forma, et inde 
aequilibrio, consistit ordo caelestis qui a solo Domino formatur, disponitur et conservatur in aeternum. </p>
