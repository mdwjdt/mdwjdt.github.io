<h3 align="center" class="ired">属天的奥秘 第6788节</h3>
<h4 align="center"></h4><p><strong>6788.</strong>“他对女儿们说”表关于教会神圣事物的思维。这从“说”和“女儿”的含义清楚可知：“说”是指思维（参看<a href="3395.htm">3395</a>节）；“女儿”是指教会的神圣事物（<a href="6775.htm">6775</a>节）。此处由“女儿”所表示的神圣事物是指真理。在圣言中，这些真理被称为“神圣”，是因为在人那里成为信之真理的真理源于良善；还因为从主的神性人身发出的，是源于神性良善的神性真理。正因如此，“圣灵”是指从主发出的神圣影响力；因为圣灵本身不会从祂发出，发出的是圣灵所说的神性话语，凡思想这个问题的人，都能明白这一点。圣灵，也就是所谓的“保惠师”，就是从主的神性人身发出的神性真理；“神圣”一词论及神性真理，这一事实从主在约翰福音中的话清楚看出来：<br />我要求父，父就另外赐给你们一位保惠师，叫祂永远与你们同在，就是真理的圣灵，乃世人不能接受的，因为不见祂，也不认识祂；保惠师，就是父因我的名所要差来的圣灵，祂要将一切的事指教你们，并且要叫你们想起我对你们所说的一切话。（约翰福音<a href="http://39-27.cn/约14.16.htm">14:16</a>-<a href="http://39-27.cn/约14.17.htm">17</a>，<a href="http://39-27.cn/约14.26.htm">26</a>）<br /><br />我要从父那里给你们差来的保惠师，就是从父出来真理的圣灵来了，就要为我作见证。（约翰福音<a href="http://39-27.cn/约15.26.htm">15:26</a>）<br /><br />只等祂，真理的圣灵来了，祂要引导你们进入一切的真理；因为祂不是凭自己说的，乃是把祂所听见的都说出来。祂要荣耀我，因为祂要将受于我的告诉你们。凡父所有的，都是我的，所以我说，祂要将受于我的告诉你们。（约翰福音<a href="http://39-27.cn/约16.13.htm">16:13</a>-<a href="http://39-27.cn/约16.15.htm">15</a>）<br />如果将这些经文与其它许多经文对照，就会明白圣灵是从主的神性人身发出的一种神圣；因为主说：“父因我的名所要差来的”，以及“我要从父那里给你们差来的”；还有，“祂要将受于我的告诉你们”；还有“凡父所有的，都是我的，所以我说，祂要将受于我的告诉你们”。由此也明显可知，“神圣”一词论及真理，因为保惠师被称为“真理的圣灵”。</p>

And he said unto his daughters. That this signifies thought concerning the holy things of the church, is evident from the signification of "saying," as being thought (see n. 3395); and from the signification 
of "daughters," as being the holy things of the church (n. 6775). The holy things which are here signified by "daughters" are truths. In the Word these are called "holy," by reason that the truths 
which with man become truths of faith, are from good; and because that which proceeds from the Lord's Divine Human is Divine truth from Divine good. Hence it is that the "Holy Spirit" is the holy 
which proceeds from the Lord; for the Spirit itself does not proceed, but the holy which the Spirit speaks, as everyone can understand who considers the matter. That the Holy Spirit, which is also called 
the "Paraclete," is the Divine truth proceeding from the Lord's Divine Human, and that the holy is predicated of the Divine truth, is evident from the Lord's words in John: </p>
<p>     I will ask the 
Father that He shall give you another Paraclete, that He may abide with you forever; even the Spirit of truth, whom the world cannot receive, because it seeth Him not, neither knoweth Him. The Paraclete, 
the Holy Spirit, whom the Father will send in My name, He shall teach you all things, and shall remind you of all things which I have said unto you (John 14:16-17, 26).      When the Paraclete is 
come, whom I will send unto you from the Father, even the Spirit of truth, who goeth out from the Father, He shall testify of Me (John 15:26).      When He, the Spirit of truth, is come, He shall lead 
you into all truth; He shall not speak from Himself, but what things soever He shall hear, He shall speak. He shall glorify Me; for He shall take of Mine, and shall declare it unto you. All things 
whatsoever the Father hath are Mine; therefore said I, that He shall take of Mine, and shall declare it unto you (John 16:13-15).  If these passages are collated with many others, it can be understood 
that the Holy Spirit is the holy which proceeds from the Lord's Divine Human; for the Lord says, "Whom the Father shall send in My name;" also, "Whom I will send unto you from the Father;" and further, 
"He shall take of Mine and declare it unto you; all things that the Father hath are Mine, therefore said I, that He shall take of Mine, and shall declare it unto you." It is also evident that the 
holy is predicated of truth, for the Paraclete is called the "Spirit of truth." </p>

'And he said to his daughters' means thought about the holy things belonging to the Church. This is clear from the meaning of saying' as thought, dealt with in <a href="3395.htm">3395</a>; and from the meaning of 'daughters' 
as holy things belonging to the Church, dealt with above in <a href="6775.htm">6775</a>. The holy things meant here by 'daughters' are truths. In the Word these are called holy because the truths which become the truths 
of faith with a person have their origin in good, and also because what emanates from the Lord's Divine Human is Divine Truth originating in Divine Good. That being so, the Holy Spirit is a holy influence 
emanating from the Lord; the actual Spirit does not emanate from Him but the holy utterances made by the Spirit, as anyone may see who gives thought to the matter. The fact that the Holy Spirit, 
also referred to as the Paraclete, is Divine Truth emanating from the Lord's Divine Human, and the fact that the word 'holy' is used in reference to Divine Truth, is clear from the Lord's words in John, </p>
<blockquote>
I 
will ask the Father to give you another Paraclete, to remain with you forever, the Spirit of truth, whom the world cannot receive, because it neither sees Him nor knows Him. The Paraclete, the 
Holy Spirit, whom the Father will send in My name, He will teach you all things and remind you of all that I said to you. <a href="http://bible.gospelcom.net/cgi-bin/bible?passage=John%2014:16,17,%2026&amp;version=ESV&amp;interface=print&amp;showfn=yes&amp;showxref">John 14:16,17, 26</a>. 
</blockquote>
<p>In the same gospel, </p>
<blockquote>
When the Paraclete comes, whom I 
shall send to you from the Father, the Spirit of truth who goes forth from the Father, He will bear witness to Me. <a href="http://bible.gospelcom.net/cgi-bin/bible?passage=John%2015:26&amp;version=ESV&amp;interface=print&amp;showfn=yes&amp;showxref">John 15:26</a>. 
</blockquote>
<p>And in the same gospel, </p>
<blockquote>
When He the Spirit of truth comes, He will 
guide you into all truth; for He will not speak from Himself, but whatever He hears He will speak. He will glorify Me, for He will receive from what is Mine and declare It to you; all things whatever 
that the Father has are Mine, therefore I said that He will receive from what is Mine and declare it to you. <a href="http://bible.gospelcom.net/cgi-bin/bible?passage=John%2016:13-15&amp;version=ESV&amp;interface=print&amp;showfn=yes&amp;showxref">John 16:13-15</a>. 
</blockquote>
<p>If one compares these places with very many others one may understand that 
the Holy Spirit is a holy emanation from the Lord's Divine Human, for the Lord says, 'Whom the Father will send in My name', also 'Whom I shall send to you from the Father', as well as 'He will receive 
from what is Mine and declare it to you; all things whatever that the Father has are Mine, therefore I said that He will receive from what is Mine and declare it to you'. It is also evident that 
the word 'holy' is used in reference to truth because the Paraclete is called 'the Spirit of truth'. </p>

</p><b>6788.</b>
`Et dixit ad filias suas': quod significet cogitationem de sanctis Ecclesiae, constat ex significatione `dicere' quod sit cogitatio, de qua n. 3395; et ex significatione `filiarum' quod sint sancta 
Ecclesiae, de qua supra n. 6775; sancta {1} quae hic significantur per `filias' sunt vera; haec in Verbo vocantur sancta ex causa quia vera quae apud hominem fiunt fidei, sunt ex bono; et {2}quia quod 
procedit ex Divino Humano Domini {3}est Divinum Verum ex Divino Bono; inde est quod Sanctus Spiritus sit sanctum quod procedit ex Domino; nam non ipse Spiritus procedit, sed sanctum quod spiritus loquitur; 
quod quisque (t)intelligere potest qui expendit; quod (t)Sanctus Spiritus', qui vocatur etiam Paracletus, sit Divinum Verum (x)procedens {4}ex Divino Humano Domini, et quod sanctum dicatur de Divino 
Vero, constat ex Domini verbis apud Johannem, Ego rogabo Patrem, ut alium Paracletum det vobis, ut maneat vobiscum in aeternum, Spiritum veritatis, quem mundus non potest accipere, quoniam non 
videt illum, neque cognoscit illum: Paracletus, Spiritus Sanctus, quem mittet Pater in nomine Meo, Ille vos docebit omnia, et (x)commonefaciet vos de omnibus quae dixi vobis, xiv 16, 17, 26: </p>
<p>apud eundem, Quando 
venerit Paracletus, quem Ego missurus sum vobis a Patre, Spiritus veritatis, qui ex Patre exit, Ille testabitur de Me, xv 26: </p>
<p>et apud eundem, Quando venerit ille Spiritus veritatis, ducet 
vos in omnem veritatem: non enim loquetur a Seipso, sed quaecumque audiverit, loquetur; Ille Me glorificabit, quia ex Meo accipiet et annuntiabit vobis; omnia quaecumque Pater habet Mea sunt, propter 
hoc dixi, quod de Meo accepturus sit, et annuntiaturus vobis, xvi 13-15; </p>
<p>si haec loca conferantur cum aliis pluribus, intelligi potest quod Sanctus Spiritus sit sanctum quod procedit a {5}Divino Humano 
Domini, dicit enim Dominus, `Quem Pater missurus in nomine Meo'; tum `quem Ego missurus sum vobis a Patre'; ut et `Ille ex Meo accipiet et annuntiabit vobis, omnia quaecumque Pater habet Mea sunt, 
propter hoc dixi, quod de Meo accepturus {6}sit, et annuntiaturus vobis'; {7} (t)patet quoque quod sanctum praedicetur de vero, nam Paracletus vocatur Spiritus veritatis. 	@1 i Ecclesiae$ 	@2 procedunt$ 	@3 
ita$ 	@4 a Domino$ 	@5 Domino, quod etiam intelligi potest, quod sanctum illud procedat a Domino, nam explicatur quid intelligitur per quod Pater missurus Illum, quod sit ex Domino, Dominus 
enim dicit$ 	@6 est$ 	@7 i tum$ </p>
