<h4 align="center"></h4><p><strong>792.</strong>创世记7:19，20．水势在地上越来越大，普天下所有的高山都淹没了。水势比山高过十五肘，山岭都淹没了。<br />“水势在地上越来越大”表虚假的信念就像这样增多。“普天下所有的高山都淹没了”表一切仁之善都灭绝了。“水势比山高过十五肘，山岭都淹没了”表无一丝良善存留，“十五”表极其稀少，几近于无。</p>

And the water strengthened greatly, greatly on the earth, and all the high mountains that were under the whole heaven were covered. Fifteen cubits upward the water towered, and it covered the mountains.<br />The water strengthened greatly, greatly on the earth means that persuasive lies piled up in this way. And all the high mountains that were under the whole heaven were covered means that all the good effects of charity were obliterated. Fifteen cubits upward the water towered, and it covered the mountains means that nothing was left of charity; fifteen symbolizes what is so meager as to be hardly anything. </p>
<p align="center"><b>Potts(1905-1910) 792</b></p><p><b>792.</b>
Verses 19, 20. And the waters were strengthened very exceedingly upon the earth, and all the high mountains that were under the whole heaven were covered. Fifteen cubits upward did the waters prevail, 
and covered the mountains. "And the waters were strengthened very exceedingly upon the earth" signifies that persuasions of falsity thus increased; "and all the high mountains that were under the whole 
heaven were covered" signifies that all goods of charity were extinguished; "fifteen cubits upward did the waters prevail, and covered the mountains" signifies that nothing of charity remained; "fifteen" 
signifies so few as to be scarcely any. </p>

<p align="center"><b>Elliott(1983-1999) 792</b></p><p><b>792.</b>
Verses 19, 20 And the waters grew stronger and stronger over the earth, and all the high mountains beneath the whole sky were covered. For fifteen cubits upwards the waters prevailed and covered the 
mountains. </p>
<p>'The waters grew stronger and stronger over the earth' means that persuasions of falsity increased in this way. 'And all the high mountains beneath the whole sky were covered' means that 
all goods stemming from charity were done away with. 'From fifteen cubits upwards the waters prevailed and covered the mountains' means that no trace of charity remained, 'fifteen' meaning things so 
few as to be scarcely any at all. </p>

</p><b>792.</b>
Vers. 19, 20.  Et aquae corroboratae valde valde super terra, et operti sunt omnes montes alti, qui sub toto caelo. Quindecim cubitis de sursum superarunt aquae, et operuerunt montes. 'Aquae corroboratae 
valde valde super terra' significant persuasiones falsi quod ita accreverint: 'et operti sunt omnes montes alti, qui sub toto caelo' significant quod omnia bona charitatis exstincta sint: 'quod 
quindecim cubitis de sursum superarint aquae, et operuerint montes' significant quod nihil residui esset de charitate; 'quindecim' significant ita paucum ut vix quicquam. </p>
