<h3 align="center" class="ired">属天的奥秘 第2735节</h3>
<h4 align="center"></h4><p><strong>2735.</strong>真正的婚姻之爱是天堂的形像，在来世表现为最美丽的事物，是眼所未见，或头脑想象不到的。它表现为一个童女，有着难以形容的美丽，被亮云环绕，以至于可以说她就是美丽的化身，无论本质上还是形式上。我被告知，婚姻之爱是来世一切美丽的源头，其情感和思维表现为钻石般的光环，就像红宝石和石榴石那样闪闪发光。这些景象伴随着感染其内心最深处的快乐；但是，一有淫荡的成分进入，它们就会消失。</p>

Genuine conjugial love is the image of heaven, and when it is represented in the other life this is done by the most beautiful things that can ever be seen by the eyes, or conceived by the mind. It is 
represented by a virgin of inexpressible beauty, encompassed by a bright cloud, so that it may be said to be beauty itself in essence and form. It has been said that all beauty in the other life is 
from conjugial love. Its affections and thoughts are represented by diamond-like auras, sparkling as it were with rubies and carbuncles, and these things are attended with delights which affect the inmosts 
of the mind; but as soon as anything of lasciviousness enters in, they disappear. </p>

Genuine conjugial love is the image of heaven, and when a representation of it is made in the next life this is done by means of the most beautiful things which can possibly be seen with the eyes or 
conceived in the mind. It is represented by a virgin of indescribable beauty who is surrounded by a shining cloud, so that one may speak of her as being beauty itself in essence and form. I have been 
told that conjugial love is the source of all beauty in the next life, its affections and thoughts being represented by bands of light sparkling so to speak with rubies and garnets. These sights are accompanied 
by delights which stir the inmost recesses of their minds; but as soon as anything at all licentious enters in they vanish. </p>

<p align="center"><b>Latin(1748-1756) 2735</b>
</p><b>2735.</b>
Genuinus amor conjugialis est imago caeli, et cum repraesentatur in altera vita, fit per pulcherrima quae usquam oculis videri et mente capi possunt; repraesentatur per virginem pulchritudinis inexpressibilis 
cinctam candida nube, sic ut dici queat quod sit ipsa pulchritudo in essentia et forma; dictum quod ex amore conjugiali sit omnis pulchritudo in altera vita; affectiones et cogitationes ejus 
repraesentantur per auras adamantinas ex quasi rubinis et pyropis scintillantes, et haec cum deliciis quae afficiunt intima mentium: ut primum autem aliquid lascivi intervenit, disparantur. </p>
