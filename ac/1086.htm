<h3 align="center" class="ired">属天的奥秘 第1086节</h3>
<h4 align="center"></h4><p>1086．“倒退着进去”表他们不在意错误和堕落。这一点从“倒退”的含义清楚看出来，它表转眼不看，这从下文说他们“看不见父亲的赤身”明显可知。“看不见”的内义就是不在意。</p>

<p><strong>[NCE]1086.</strong> The fact that they went backward means that they paid no attention to errors and perversions can be seen from the meaning of going backward as averting one's gaze and not seeing. This meaning is also corroborated below, where it says that they did not see their father's nakedness. In the inner meaning, not seeing something is not paying attention to it. </p>

And went backward. That this signifies that they did not attend to the errors and perversions, is evident from the signification of "going backward" as being to avert the eyes and not see; which is plain 
from what follows, where it is said that they did not see the nakedness of their father. "Not to see" in the internal sense is not to attend to. </p>

'They went backwards' means that they took no notice of errors and perversities This becomes clear from the meaning of 'going backwards' as turning away the eyes and not seeing, as is also evident from 
what follows where it is said that 'they did not see their father's nakedness'. In the internal sense 'not seeing' is taking no notice of. </p>

</p><b>1086.</b>
Quod 'iverunt retrorsum' significet quod non attenderent ad errores et perversa, constare potest ex significatione 'ire retrorsum' quod sit avertere oculos et non videre, sicut etiam ex sequentibus 
patet ubi dicitur quod 'nuditatem patris sui non viderint'; 'non videre' in sensu interno est non attendere. </p>
