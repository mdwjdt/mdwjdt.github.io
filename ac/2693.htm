<h3 align="center" class="ired">属天的奥秘 第2693节</h3>
<h4 align="center"></h4><p><strong>2693.</strong>“对她说，夏甲！你为何这样呢”表对一个人状态的直觉。这从说在圣言历史部分的含义，以及“夏甲！你为何这样呢”的含义清楚可知：“说”是指发觉，如前所述；“夏甲！你为何这样呢”是指它当时的状态。此处的意思是，主十分清楚它的状态，尽管问她说“夏甲！你为何这样呢”。从字面上看，这是主在询问，但就内义而言，所表示的是对万事万物的无限直觉。我们在圣言各处会读到，人们被问及他们的状态；被问及的原因在于，人以为没人知道他的思想，更不用说其情感的状态了。另外一个原因是，人们通过能表达自己的感受而获得安慰，这对他们来说通常是有好处的（参看<a href="1701.htm">1701</a>，<a href="1931.htm">1931</a>节）。</p>

And said unto her, What aileth thee, Hagar? That this signifies perception concerning its state, is evident from the signification of "saying" in the historic parts of the Word, as being to perceive-explained 
before; and from the signification of "What aileth thee, Hagar?" as being the state in which it was: here it signifies that the Lord thoroughly knew its state, although she was questioned, and 
it is said, What aileth thee, Hagar ? In the sense of the letter it is interrogation from the Lord, but in the internal sense it is infinite perception of all things. We read here and there in the 
Word that men are questioned as to their state; but the reason is that man believes that no one knows his thoughts, still less the state of his affection. A further reason is that men may have consolation 
from being able to express their feelings, which often proves a relief (see n. 1701, 1931). </p>

<p align="center"><b>Elliott(1983-1999) 2693</b></p><p><b>2693.</b>
'And said to her, What is the matter, Hagar?' means perception regarding one's state. This is clear from the meaning of 'saying' in historical parts of the Word as perceiving, dealt with already, and 
from the meaning of 'What is the matter, Hagar?' as its state at the time. Although He questions her and says, 'What is the matter, Hagar?' the meaning here is that the Lord knew its state. In the sense 
of the letter this is a question asked by the Lord, but in the internal sense the infinite perception of all things is meant. One reads in various places in the Word of people being questioned about 
their state, but the reason why they are questioned is this: Man has no other belief than that no one knows his thoughts, let alone the state of his affection. An added reason is that people may be 
helped by being able to express their feelings (sensa animi), which usually does them good, see <a href="1701.htm">1701</a>,<a href="1931.htm">1931</a>. </p>

<p align="center"><b>Latin(1748-1756) 2693</b>
</p><b>2693.</b>
`Dixit ei, Quid tibi Hagar': quod significet perceptionem de statu ejus, constat a significatione `dicere' in historicis Verbi quod sit percipere, de qua prius; et a significatione `quid tibi Hagar' 
quod sit status in quo esset; hic significat quod Dominus noverit ejus statum, tametsi interrogatur illa, et dicitur `quid tibi Hagar.' In sensu litterae est interrogatio a Domino, at in sensu interno 
est infinita perceptio omnium; quod interrogentur homines de statu eorum, passim legitur in Verbo, sed est causa quia homo non aliter credit quam quod nemo sciat cogitationes, minus statum affectionis; 
tum quoque ut solatium inde habeant ut aperire queant sensa animi, quod solet medelae esse, videatur n. 1701, 1931. </p>
