<h3 align="center" class="ired">属天的奥秘 第3436节</h3>
<h4 align="center"></h4><p><strong>3436.</strong>“他从那里上别是巴去”表由此而来的神圣信之教义。这从“别是巴”的含义清楚可知，“别是巴”是指神圣的信之教义（<a href="2723.htm">2723</a>，<a href="2858.htm">2858</a>，<a href="2859.htm">2859</a>节）。此处“别是巴”所表示的信之教义正是圣言的字义本身，因为圣言就是教义本身。尽管圣言的字义使得人们能从中汲取真理，但它也有这样的性质，他们能由此确认并非真实的事物，这从异端的存在清楚可知。人若为了变得有智慧，也就是为了行善并明白真理而阅读圣言，就会照着他的意图和情感而获得指教。事实上，主会在他不知不觉的情况下流入进来，并开启他的心智；当他不理解这一处的圣言经文时，主会通过其它经文使他明白。<br />此外，人若处于简单的良善，并照字义简单地相信圣言，那么在来世接受天使教导时，就被赋予领悟真理的能力。与此同时，他所拥有的少数真理被仁爱和纯真复活，当仁爱和纯真存在于他里面时，已渗透到其无知黑暗中的虚假就不会造成伤害，因为它们没有与良善联结，而是从它退离，仿佛到了周边，因而能轻易被逐出。然而，那些并未过着良善生活之人的情形则截然不同。对他们来说，因着错误的解释而从圣言所孵化出来的虚假占据中间，或可以说占据核心，而真理则在四围或周边。结果，虚假与其生活的邪恶联结，真理则被驱散。</p>

And he went up from thence to Beersheba. That this signifies that from this the doctrine of faith was Divine, is evident from the signification of "Beersheba" as being the doctrine of faith, which is 
Divine (n. 2723, 2858, 2859). The doctrine of faith, which is here signified by "Beersheba" is the very literal sense of the Word, for the Word is doctrine itself; and although the Word as to the literal 
sense is such that truths may be drawn from it, it is also such that things not true may be confirmed from it, as is well known from the existence of heresies. But he who reads the Word in order 
to be wise, that is, to do what is good and understand what is true, is instructed according to his end and affection; for unknown to him the Lord flows in and enlightens his mind, and where he is at 
a loss, gives understanding from other passages. [2] Moreover the man who is in simple good, and in simplicity believes the Word according to its literal sense, when instructed in the other life by angels 
is gifted with the faculty of perceiving truths; and in the meantime the few truths he has are vivified by charity and innocence; and when these are in the truths, the falsities which also had infused 
themselves in the shade of his ignorance are not hurtful, for they are not adjoined to good, but are withheld therefrom as it were in the circumference, and thus can be easily cast out. Very different 
however is the case with those who are not in the good of life, for with them the falsities which by a wrong interpretation they have hatched from the Word hold as it were the middle or center, 
and truths the surroundings or circumferences; and therefore falsities are adjoined to the evil of their life and truths are dispersed. </p>

<p align="center"><b>Elliott(1983-1999) 3436</b></p><p><b>3436.</b>
'And he went up from there to Beersheba' means that the Divine doctrine of faith came from there. This is clear from the meaning of 'Beersheba' as the Divine doctrine of faith, dealt with in <a href="2723.htm">2723</a>, <a href="2858.htm">2858</a>, <a href="2859.htm">2859</a>. The doctrine of faith, which is meant by Beersheba here, is the literal sense itself of the Word, for the Word is doctrine itself. And although the literal sense of the Word is such that people 
are able to draw truths from it, it is also such that they are able to confirm from it things that are not true, as is well known from heresies. But anyone who reads the Word with the intention of 
being wise, that is, of doing good and understanding truth, gains instruction according to his intention and affection. In fact without his knowing it the Lord flows in and enlightens the mind, and when 
he cannot grasp what is said in one place in the Word the Lord imparts to him understanding from others.  </p>
<p></p>
<p><b>[2]</b>
 Furthermore anyone in whom simple good is present and who in simplicity believes the 
Word according to its literal sense is granted the ability to perceive truths when he is taught by angels in the next life. In the meantime the few truths that do reside with him are given life by charity 
and innocence. And when the latter are present in him the falsities which have also infiltrated the darkness of his ignorance do no harm. For these do not become allied to the good there but are 
held back from it so to speak on the boundaries and so can be removed without difficulty. But things are different in the case of those who are not leading a good life. With them the falsities which 
by wrong interpretation they hatched out of the Word occupy the middle or so to speak the centre, while truths are in the surrounding areas or boundaries. They are as a consequence falsities which do 
become allied to the evil life they are leading, and truths are scattered. </p>

`Et ascendit inde Beershebam': quod significet quod inde doctrina fidei Divina, constat a significatione `Beersheba' quod sit doctrina fidei Divina, de qua n. 2723, 2858, 2859: doctrina fidei, quae hic 
per Beershebam significatur, est ipse sensus litteralis Verbi, nam Verbum est ipsa doctrina; et tametsi Verbum quoad sensum litteralem est tale ut hauriri queant inde vera, etiam est tale ut confirmari 
queant inde non vera, prout notum est ex haeresibus: at qui ex fine sapiendi, hoc est, faciendi bonum et intelligendi verum, legit Verbum, is instruitur secundum finem et secundum affectionem ejus, 
ipso enim nesciente influit Dominus, ac illustrat mentem, (c)et ubi haeret, dat ex aliis locis intellectum; [2] praeterea, qui in simplici bono est et simpliciter credit Verbo secundum sensum ejus 
litteralem, is donatur facultate {1}percipiendi vera cum in altera vita instruitur ab angelis; ac interea pauca vera quae apud illum, vivificantur charitate et innocentia, quae cum insunt, tunc falsa 
quae quoque infuderunt se in {2}umbra ejus ignorantiae, non nocent, bono enim non adjunguntur, sed detinentur inde quasi in peripheriis, ac ita facile emoveri queunt; sed aliter se habet cum illis qui 
non in bono vitae sunt; apud (c)eos falsa quae per sinistram interpretationem ex Verbo excluserunt, medium seu quasi centrum tenent, et vera circuitus seu peripherias, quare falsa sunt quae adjunguntur 
malo vitae eorum, et vera dissipantur. @1 recipiendi ver ab angelis, cum in altera vita$  @2 umbram$  </p>
