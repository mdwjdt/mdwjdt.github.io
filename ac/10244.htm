<h3 align="center" class="ired">属天的奥秘 第10244节</h3>
<h4 align="center"></h4>
<p><strong>10244</strong>.“免得死亡”表免得代表丧失。这从“死亡”的含义清楚可知，当论及亚伦和他儿子的供职时，“死亡”是指代表、因而与天堂的联结的终止（参看<a href="9928.htm">9928</a>节）。此处的情况是这样：在建在这个民族当中的教会中，与天堂，并通过天堂与主的联结仅仅通过代表，也就是通过代表内在事物的外在事物实现。因此，一旦他们不照着规定仪式来履行祭司的职分，代表就会丧失，与它一道丧失的，还有与天堂的联结。当与天堂的联结丧失时，他们就没有任何保护，无法抵御地狱。这也造成了亚伦的两个儿子，即拿答和亚比户的死亡；因为他们把香放在了凡火上（利未记<a href="http://39-27.cn/利10.1.htm">10:1</a>，<a href="http://39-27.cn/利10.2.htm">2</a>）。他们的行为代表源于其它某种爱，而非对主之爱的敬拜；因此，他们与天堂分离并被消灭。如果亚伦或他的儿子不洗濯就近前来供职，后果是一样的；因为那时他们代表的不是源于天堂的敬拜，而是来自地狱的亵渎敬拜。由此明显可知，当论及亚伦和他儿子的供职时，“死亡”表示代表、因而与天堂的联结的消亡。</p>

That they die not. That this signifies lest the representative perish, is evident from the signification of "dying," when said of the ministration of Aaron and of his sons, as being the cessation of 
the representatives, and consequently of conjunction with heaven (see n. 9928). The case herein is this. In the church that existed with that nation, conjunction with heaven, and through heaven with the 
Lord, was solely by means of representatives, that is, by means of external things that represented internal ones; and therefore as soon as they did not minister according to the prescribed rituals, 
the representative perished, and with it conjunction with heaven. And when conjunction with heaven perished, they had no protection against hell. Hence the death of the sons of Aaron, Nadab and Abihu, 
for they put incense upon strange fire (Lev. 10:1, 2), by which was represented worship from some other love than the love of the Lord. Hence their separation from heaven, and extinction. The like 
would have happened if Aaron or his sons had come near to minister unwashed; for thus they would have represented worship not from heaven, but profane, which is from hell. From all this it is evident 
that by "dying," when said of the ministration of Aaron and of his sons, is signified the extinction of the representatives, and consequently of conjunction with the heavens. </p>

'That they may not die' means so that what is representative may not be lost. This is clear from the meaning of 'dying', when it refers to the services performed by Aaron and his sons, as the demise 
of things that were representative and consequently of a link with heaven, dealt with in <a href="9928.htm">9928</a>. The implications of this are that in the Church established among that nation a link with heaven, and through 
heaven with the Lord, was achieved solely by means of things that were representative, that is, by means of external things that represented internal ones. Therefore as soon as they ceased to perform 
priestly functions according to the prescribed rituals, that which was representative was lost, and with it the joining to heaven. And when the link with heaven was lost they had no protection against 
hell. This accounts for the death of Aaron's sons, Nadab and Abihu; for they placed incense onto foreign<A name="fntext1"></a><A href="#fn1"><sup>a</sup></a> fire, <a href="http://bible.gospelcom.net/cgi-bin/bible?passage=Lev%2010:1,2&amp;version=ESV&amp;interface=print&amp;showfn=yes&amp;showxref">Lev 10:1,2</a>. Their action represented worship springing from a love other than that 
of the Lord, as a consequence of which they were separated from heaven and annihilated. The consequences would have been the same if Aaron or his sons had drawn near to serve without washing; for then 
they would have represented worship that did not spring from heaven, but profane worship which came from hell. From all this it is evident that 'dying', when it refers to the services performed by 
Aaron and his sons, means the annihilation of things that were representative and consequently of the joining to heaven.

`Ne moriantur': quod significet ne pereat repraesentativum, constat ex significatione `mori' cum de ministratione Aharonis et filiorum ejus, quod sit cessatio repraesentativorum, et inde conjunctionis 
cum caelo, de qua n. 9928. Cum his ita se habet: conjunctio cum caelo, et per caelum cum Domino, in Ecclesia apud illam gentem, erat unice per repraesentativa, hoc est, per externa quae (x)repraesentabant 
interna; quapropter ut primum non ministrabant secundum praescripta ritualia, periit repraesentativum, et cum illo conjunctio cum caelo: et cum periit conjunctio cum caelo, non {1}aliqua illis 
tutela contra infernum {2}fuit; inde mors filiorum Aharonis, Nadabi et Abihu, dederunt enim suffimentum super ignem alienum, Lev. x 1, 2, per quod repraesentabatur cultus ex alio amore quam Domini, inde 
separatio illorum a caelo et exstinctio {3}; similiter contigisset si Aharon {4}aut filii ejus illoti accessissent ad ministrandum, {5}nam sic repraesentavissent cultum non e caelo, sed profanum, 
qui ab inferno; ex quibus patet quod per `mori' cum de ministratione Aharonis et filiorum ejus, significetur exstinctio repraesentativorum, et inde conjunctionis cum caelis. @1 amplius illis aliqua$ @2
