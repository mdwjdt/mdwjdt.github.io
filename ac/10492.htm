<h3 align="center" class="ired">属天的奥秘 第10492节</h3>
<h4 align="center"></h4><p><strong>10492</strong>.“那一天，百姓中倒下的约有三千人”表对内在之物的一种完全、彻底的关闭。这从“倒下”和“三千”的含义清楚可知：“倒下”或被杀是指被关闭，如前所述（<a href="10490.htm">10490</a>节）；“三千”是指完全或完整之物。因为“三”表示完全和完整之物（<a href="2788.htm">2788</a>，<a href="4495.htm">4495</a>，<a href="7715.htm">7715</a>，<a href="8347.htm">8347</a>，<a href="9198.htm">9198</a>，<a href="9488.htm">9488</a>，<a href="9489.htm">9489</a>节），“三千”也是，因为大数字和相乘得出它的更小数字具有相同的含义（<a href="5291.htm">5291</a>，<a href="5335.htm">5335</a>，<a href="5708.htm">5708</a>，<a href="7973.htm">7973</a>节）。在圣言中，一切数字都表示真实事物（参看<a href="9488.htm">9488</a>，<a href="10127.htm">10127</a>，<a href="10217.htm">10217</a>，<a href="10253.htm">10253</a>节提到的地方）。<br />由于此处论述的主题是以色列和犹太民族当中的内在之物的关闭，所以在此进一步说一说内在之物的这种关闭。关闭内在人的，是邪恶和虚假，或也可说，占主导地位的世俗、尘世和肉体之爱，因为它们是一切邪恶和虚假的源头。内在之物之所以被这些爱关闭，是因为它们是天堂之爱的对立面；或也可说，邪恶和虚假是良善和真理的对立面。因此，当对立物相互作用时，受伤的那一方就会压抑自己，几乎就像一根纤维被刺伤时的情形，或像人体的其它任何部位陷入疼痛时就会收缩一样。众所周知，受伤或情绪低落会使一个人的脸起邹，腹部痉挛，限制肺及其呼吸。当邪恶和虚假进入思维和意愿时，内在人也是这种情形。这时会有一种憎恶的感觉，由此有一种压抑感，这些感觉也会在脸和身体上反映出来。<br />这就是内在关闭的一般原因。但具体原因就是防止良善和真理从天堂经由内在人进入外在人，在那里遭到玷污和亵渎。为防止这一切发生在有圣言和教会的神圣事物存在于其中的以色列民族中间，他们的内在被完全关闭了。这内在被完全、彻底地关闭，这一点从以下事实明显看出来：尽管他们如今生活在基督徒中间，尽管预言明确提到了主，但他们还是完全不承认祂。事实上，他们具有这样的性质：他们甚至不能接受确认对主的信仰的任何思想，他们内心有一种否定和厌恶，因为他们的内在已经关闭。<br />此外，要知道，在基督教界，就那些从圣言知道信之真理，却不照之生活的人而言，内在也关闭了。与这些真理相一致的实际生活打开内在人；没有这种实际生活，这些真理只住在外在人的记忆中。然而，对那些否认这些真理的人来说，内在完全关闭了。看上去令人惊讶的是，内在在聪明人当中比在简单人当中更关闭。原因在于，聪明人陷入对显赫地位和金钱利益的贪欲之中，从而陷入自我之爱和尘世之爱，比简单人更甚。他们也有更大的能力来利用聪明人比简单人拥有的更丰富的记忆知识，来证实由这些爱所产生的邪恶和虚假。另外一个原因是，大多数聪明人基于学术界盛行的某种假设来思想灵魂，由此只能获得这种概念：灵魂是一口气或一阵风，或许这口气或这阵风含有某种生命的火花。而另一方面，简单善良人的思维不是基于这种观念，只是基于灵魂就是死后活着的那个人的观念。正因如此，这些简单人的内在是打开的，而那些聪明人的内在是关闭的。无论你说内在打开或关闭，还是说天堂打开或关闭，都是一回事。</p>

And there fell of the people that day up to three thousand men. That this signifies a full and complete closing of the internal, is evident from the signification of "falling" or being slain, as being 
to be closed (of which above, n. 10490); and from the signification of "three thousand," as being what is full and complete; for by "three" is signified what is full and complete (n. 2788, 4495, 7715, 
8347, 9198, 9488, 9489), in like manner by "three thousand," because the larger numbers signify the like as the smaller numbers from which they arise by multiplication (n. 5291, 5335, 5708, 7973). 
That all numbers in the Word signify real things, see the places cited in n. 9488, and n. 10127, 10217, 10253).  [2] As the closing of the internal with the Israelitish and Jewish nation has here been 
treated of, something further may be said about the closing of the internal. Evils and falsities are what close the internal man, or what is the same thing, worldly, earthly, and bodily loves, when 
they prevail, for all evils and falsities are from this source. The reason why the internal is closed by these loves, is that they are opposed to heavenly loves, or what is the same thing, evils and falsities 
are opposed to goods and truths; and when things that are opposed act against each other, that which is injured contracts almost as does a fiber when it is pricked, and as in other circumstances 
every part of man will shrink when in pain. It is well known that an injury, and also a troubled state of mind, will cause the face to wrinkle; and will also cause the abdomen, together with the lungs 
and their respiration, to contract. Such also is the case with the internal man, when evils and falsities enter into the thought and into the will. That there is then an aversion, and from this a 
contraction, is perceived, and is also apparent. [3] This is the general reason why the internal is closed; but the special reason is to prevent goods and truths from entering from heaven through the 
internal man into the external man, and there being defiled and profaned; and therefore in order to prevent this with the Israelitish nation, with whom was the Word together with the holy things of 
the church, the internal was with them fully and completely closed. That it was fully and completely closed is evident from the fact that although they live among Christians, and although the Lord is 
plainly treated of in the prophecies, they nevertheless do not at all acknowledge Him; nay, they are of such a nature that they cannot even think anything which is confirmatory; such is the interior repugnance 
and aversion. [4] Be it known moreover that in the Christian world also the internal is closed with those who know the truths of faith from the Word and do not live according to them, for it 
is precisely a life in accordance with these truths that opens the internal man; for otherwise the truths reside merely in the memory of the external man. But in very deed with those who deny these 
truths the internal is completely closed; and, wonderful as it may seem, the internal is closed in more of the intelligent than of the simple. The reason is that the intelligent are in the cupidities 
of attaining to eminence and to wealth, and consequently are in the loves of self and of the world, more than are the simple; and are also able to confirm, by means of memory-knowledges, in which the 
intelligent excel the simple, the evils and falsities which are from these loves. An additional reason is that most of the intelligent think of the soul from some hypothesis that prevails in the learned 
world, from which they conceive no other idea of the soul than as of breath or of wind in which perchance there is a living principle; while on the other hand the simple do not think from such an idea, 
but only from the idea that the soul is the man who lives after death. From this it is that with the latter the internal is opened; but with the former it is closed. Whether you say that the internal 
is opened or closed, or whether you say that heaven is so, is the same. </p>

'And there fell of the people on that day up to three thousand men' means a complete shutting off of what is internal. This is clear from the meaning of 'falling' or being killed as being shut off, dealt 
with above in <a href="10490.htm">10490</a>; and from the meaning of 'three thousand' as that which is complete. For 'three' means what is full and complete, see <a href="2788.htm">2788</a>, <a href="4495.htm">4495</a>, <a href="7715.htm">7715</a>, <a href="8347.htm">8347</a>, <a href="9198.htm">9198</a>, <a href="9488.htm">9488</a>, <a href="9489.htm">9489</a>, and 'three thousand' 
likewise, because every large number has a similar meaning to the smaller ones of which it is the product when they are multiplied together, <a href="5291.htm">5291</a>, <a href="5335.htm">5335</a>, <a href="5708.htm">5708</a>, <a href="7973.htm">7973</a>. All numbers in the Word mean 
spiritual realities or real things, see in the places referred to in <a href="9488.htm">9488</a>, and in <a href="10127.htm">10127</a>, <a href="10217.htm">10217</a>, <a href="10253.htm">10253</a>.  </p>
<p></p>
<p><b>[2]</b>
 Since then the subject here has been the shutting off of what was internal among the Israelite 
and Jewish nation, let something further be stated here regarding the shutting off of what is internal. Evils and falsities are what shut off the internal man, or what amounts to the same thing, 
worldly, earthly, and bodily kinds of love do so when they are predominant; for they are the source of all evils and falsities. The reason why what is internal is shut off by them is that those kinds 
of love are the opposites of heavenly kinds; or what amounts to the same thing, evils and falsities are the opposites of forms of good and truths. Therefore when opposites act against each other that 
which has been injured holds itself in, just as a fibre does when it is pricked, or as any other part of the human body does from pain. It is well known that injury or a depressed state of mind can put 
creases on a person's face, cramp the abdomen, and restrict the lungs and their breathing. So it is also with the internal man when evils and falsities enter thought and will. There is a feeling of 
detestation then, and a consequent holding in, which also reveal themselves in the face and in the body.  </p>
<p></p>
<p><b>[3]</b>
 This is the general reason why the internal is closed. But the specific reason is to prevent 
forms of good and truths from passing from heaven by way of the internal man into the external, and from their being defiled and rendered profane there. To prevent this from happening with the 
Israelite nation among whom the Word and the holy things of the Church existed, their internal was completely shut off. Its being completely shut off is plainly evident from the fact that although they 
now live among Christians, and although prophecies plainly refer to the Lord, they still do not at all acknowledge Him. Indeed they are such that they are not even able to entertain any thought that 
strengthens [belief in the Lord]. There is inward repudiation and revulsion, because their internal has been closed.  </p>
<p></p>
<p><b>[4]</b>
 In addition it should be recognized that in the Christian world as well the 
internal is closed in the case of those who know the truths of faith from the Word and do not lead a life in keeping with them. An actual life in keeping with them opens the internal man; without it 
those truths reside merely in the external man's memory. With those however who repudiate these truths the internal is completely closed. And astonishing though it may seem to be, the internal is closed 
more in the case of intelligent than in that of simple people. The reason for this is that the intelligent are ruled by desires for high position and monetary gain, and consequently by self-love and 
love of the world, more than the simple are. They also have a greater ability to justify evils and falsities resulting from those loves by the use of factual knowledge, which the intelligent possess 
more abundantly than the simple do. Added to this, the majority of them think of the soul on the basis of some hypothesis in the learned world, from which they gain no other idea than that of a breath 
of air or a puff of wind which perhaps contains some spark of life. The thought of simple but good people on the other hand is not based on such an idea, only on the idea that the soul is the person 
living after death. So it is that the internal of these simple people is open, whereas that of those intelligent ones is closed. Whether you speak of the internal being opened or closed, or you speak 
of heaven being so, it amounts to the same thing.  </p>

`Et cecidit in populo in die illo ad tria milia virorum': quod significet occlusionem interni plenariam, constat ex significatione `cadere' seu occidi, quod sit occludi, de qua supra n. 10,490, et ex 
significatione `trium milium' quod sit plenarium, per `tria' enim significatur plenum et completum, videatur n. 2788, 4495, 7715, 8347: 9198, 9488, 9489, similiter per `tria milia' quoniam numeri majores 
significant simile cum minoribus ex quibus per multiplicationem existunt, n. 5291, 5335, 5708, 7973; quod omnes numeri in Verbo significent res, in locis citatis n. 9488, et n. 10,127, 10,217, 10,253. 	[2] 
Quoniam hic nunc actum est de occlusione interni apud gentem Israeliticam et Judaicam, licet adhuc aliquid de occlusione (o)interni dicere: mala et falsa sunt quae occludunt internum hominem, 
seu quod idem, amores mundani, terrestres, et corporei cum regnant, nam inde (o)sunt omnia mala et falsa; causa quod internum ab illis occludatur, est quia amores illi oppositi sunt amoribus caelestibus, 
seu quod idem, mala et falsa opposita sunt bonis et veris; cum itaque opposita agunt contra se mutuo, contrahit se quod laeditur, vix aliter ac fibra cum pungitur, (c)et (o)alioquin omne hominis 
ex dolore {1}; quod facies ejus ex laesione et {2} ex lugubri statu animi {3} se corruget, et quod abdomen hominis cum pulmone et ejus respiratione se coarctet, notum est; ita quoque se habet cum 
interno homine cum mala (c)in falsa in cogitationem (c)ac in voluntatem intrant; (m)quod aversatio tunc sit, et ex illa contractio, percipitur, et quoque apparet in facie et in corpore;(n) haec causa 
communis est quod claudatur internum; causa autem specialis est ne bona et vera intrent e caelo per internum hominem in externum, et ibi conspurcentur ac profanentur; ne itaque hoc fieret apud gentem 
Israeliticam, apud quam erat Verbum, et erant sancta Ecclesiae, internum apud illos plenarie occlusum est; quod plenarie occlusum sit, patet manifeste ex eo {4} quod tametsi inter Christianos vivunt, 
et tametsi in propheticis {5} manifeste agitur de Domino, usque ipsum prorsus non agnoscant; immo tales sunt ut ne quidem cogitare possint aliquid quod confirmat, est renuentia et aversatio interior, 
quoniam illis clausum est. 	[4] Praeterea sciendum est quod etiam in Christiano orbe apud illos clausum sit internum {6} qui sciunt vera fidei ex Verbo et non vivunt secundum illa, ipsa enim vita secundum 
illa aperit internum hominem, alioquin resident modo in memoria {7} externi hominis; at vero apud illos qui negant illa, internum prorsus clausum est; et quod mirum videri potest, internum apud 
plures intelligentes clausum est quam apud simplices; causa est quia intelligentes in cupiditatibus eminendi et lucrandi, et inde in amoribus sui et mundi prae simplicibus sunt, et quoque in facultate 
confirmandi mala et falsa quae ex amoribus illis, {8} per scientifica, in quibus intelligentes prae simplicibus sunt; accedit quod plerique eorum de anima cogitent ex aliqua hypothesi in orbe erudito 
{9}, ex qua non aliam (t)ideam capiunt quam sicut de pneumate aut de vento in quo forte vivum; cum vicissim simplices boni non ex tali idea cogitent {10}, sed solum ex idea quod anima sit homo qui vivit 
post mortem; inde est quod his aperiatur internum, illis autem claudatur.  Sive dicas internum aperiri aut claudi sive dicas caelum, idem est. @1 cum laeditur$ @2 i quoque$ @3 animo inducto$ @4 
nam internus homo dicatus est recipiendum verum et bonum e coelo, ut supra dictum est, sed clauditur ille tunc, et non destruetur, nam si destrueretur, homo non amplius esset homo, sed irrationalis 
fera, periret enim facultas cogitandi in externo ejus homine, et cum illa facultas loquendi; etiam si non clauderetur internus homo, intrarent e coelo in externum vera et bona fidei et amoris, ac ibi 
conspurcarentur, inde prophanatio, quae tunc solum fit apud illos, qui agnoverunt vera et bona fidei, ac postea negant illa, de quibus videatur in locis citatis n. 10,284; ne itaque gens Israelitica prophanarent 
vera et bona fidei, internum apud illos plenarie occlusum est; illi enim prae aliis populis legunt Verbum, ubi sancta Divina sunt; si ibi agnovissent illa, non potuissent non prophanare illa;
