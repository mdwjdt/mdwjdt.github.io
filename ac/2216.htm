<h3 align="center" class="ired">属天的奥秘 第2216节</h3>
<h4 align="center"></h4><p>2216．“那位说，不然，你实在笑了”表然而，它是这样。这也是显而易见的，无需解释。有关这些事的情况通过前面有关“笑”或“笑声”含义的论述（<a href="2072.htm">2072</a>节）变得清晰明朗，即“笑”或“笑声”是指这理性的一种情感，事实上，是这理性所具有的对真理或虚假的情感，这种情感是一切笑声的源头。只要这理性里面有这种表现为笑声的情感存在，就有某种肉体或世俗之物，因而有纯粹的人性粘附于它。属天之善和属灵之善并不发笑，而是以另一种方式通过表情和言谈举止来表达它们的快乐和愉悦。因为笑声里面包含了太多东西，绝大部分是某种轻蔑，这种轻蔑即使没有表现出来，也仍隐藏于内。笑声很容易与心灵的愉悦区分开来，心灵的愉悦也会产生某种类似笑声的东西。主所具有的人类理性的状态由“撒拉笑了”来描述，并由此表示那时与良善分离的理性真理对这些话，即它要被脱去，神性要被披上，怀有哪种情感。并非主发笑，而是祂通过神性发觉这理性仍具有何种性质，以及它里面尚有多少人性，而这人性要被逐出。就内义而言，这就是撒拉的笑声所表示的。</p>

He said, Nay, for thou didst laugh. That this signifies that nevertheless it was such, is also evident without explication. How the case is with these things is evident from what is said above (n. 2072) 
concerning the signification of "laughing," or of "laughter," that it is an affection of the rational, and indeed the affection of truth or of falsity, in the rational, that is the source of all laughter. 
So long as there is in the rational such an affection as displays itself in laughter, so long there is in it something corporeal or worldly, and thus merely human. Celestial good and spiritual 
good do not laugh, but express their delight and cheerfulness in the face, the speech, and the gesture, in another way; for there are very many things in laughter, for the most part something of contempt, 
which, even if it does not appear, nevertheless lies concealed; and laughter is easily distinguished from cheerfulness of the mind, which also produces something similar to it. The state of the 
human rational with the Lord is described by Sarah's "laughing;" and thereby is signified with what kind of affection the truth of the rational, at that time separated from good, regarded what was said: 
that it should be put off, and the Divine put on; not that the Lord laughed, but that He perceived from the Divine what the rational still was, and how much of the human there still was in it, and 
which was to be expelled. In the internal sense this is what is signified by Sarah's "laughing." </p>

<p align="center"><b>Elliott(1983-1999) 2216</b></p><p><b>2216.</b>
That 'He said, No, but you did laugh' means that nevertheless it was such is also clear without explanation. The situation with these matters becomes clear from what has been stated above in <a href="2072.htm">2072</a> about 
the meaning of 'Laughing' or laughter - that by it is meant an affection belonging to the rational, and indeed the affection for truth or for falsity within the rational, which affection is the source 
of all laughter. As long as such an affection exists in the rational as displays itself in laughter there is something bodily or worldly and thus merely human attached to it. Celestial good and spiritual 
good do not laugh, but express their delight and cheer in a different manner in their face, speech, and movement of the body. For very much is contained within laughter, for the most part something 
of contempt which, though it does not show itself, is nevertheless lying underneath, and is easily distinguished from cheerfulness of the mind (animus) which also produces something that appears 
like laughter. The state of the human rational with the Lord is described by Sarah's laughter, by which is meant the kind of affection with which the truth belonging to the rational, at that time separated 
from good, regarded what was said, namely that it was to be cast off and the Divine put on. Not that the Lord laughed but that He perceived from the Divine what the nature still was of the rational 
with Him and how much of the human was still present in it, and which was to be expelled. This is what is meant in the internal sense by 'Sarah's laughter'. </p>

Quod `et dixit, Non, quod risisti' significet quod usque (t)tale esset,' constat etiam absque explicatione.  Quomodo haec se habent, constare potest ab illis quae supra n. 2072 de significatione `ridere 
seu risus' dicta sunt, quod nempe sit affectio rationalis, et quidem affectio veri aut falsi in rationali, inde est omnis risus; quamdiu talis affectio in rationali est quae se in risum exserit, 
tamdiu est aliquid corporeum aut mundanum, ita mere humanum; bonum caeleste et bonum spirituale non ridet, sed jucundum et hilare suum in facie, loquela et gestu alio modo depromit; in risu enim sunt 
permulta, ut plurimum aliquid contemptus qui tametsi non apparet, usque sublatet, seque distinguit facile ab hilaritate animi quae quoque aliquod simile risus producit.  Describitur status rationalis 
humani apud Dominum per quod `Sarah risit,' et significatum per id, qua affectione verum rationalis tunc a bono separatum spectaret {1} illud quod (o)dicebatur, quod exueretur et Divinum indueretur; non 
quod riserit, sed quod ex Divino perceperit quale adhuc {2} esset, et quantum humani adhuc {3} inesset quod expelleret; hoc significatur per `risum Sarae' in sensu interno. 	@1  spectavit.$ 	@2 i
