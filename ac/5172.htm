<h3 align="center" class="ired">属天的奥秘 第5172节</h3>
<h4 align="center"></h4><p><strong>5172.</strong>有些正直灵人无需深入思考，因而能迅速，可以说不假思索地说出自己的任何想法。他们有一种内在觉知，这种内在觉知不像其他灵人的那样通过冥想和思考显现。因为他们一生当中都在教导自己有关良善的事，却不怎么教导它们的真理。我被告知，这类灵人属于胸腺的区域；因为胸腺是一种专门服务于幼儿的腺体；在这个年龄，这种腺体是柔软的。属该区域的灵人就保留了孩子般的柔软，对良善的觉知能流入其中；对真理的总体印象则从这种觉知闪耀出来。这些灵人能处在巨大的骚乱中却不受干扰，就像这种腺体一样。</p>

There are certain upright spirits who think without any meditation, and who therefore rapidly and as it were without premeditation utter whatever occurs to their thought. They have an interior perception, 
which does not become so visual by means of meditations and thoughts as is the case with others; for in the course of their lives they have been as it were self-instructed about the goodness of 
things, but not so much so about the truth of them. I have been told that such persons belong to the province of the Thymus Gland; for the thymus is a gland that is especially serviceable to infants, 
and during that age is soft. In such spirits likewise there remains a soft infantile quality, into which the perception of good flows, and from which perception truth shines forth in a general manner. 
These spirits are able to be in great turmoils without being disturbed, as is also the case with the gland in question. </p>

There are certain upright spirits who do not have to cogitate and who can therefore express quickly whatever ideas occur to them without having to think about them. They enjoy an interior kind of perception, 
which does not reveal itself in thought and reflection, as is the case with other spirits. For during the course of their lives they had taught themselves about the goodness of things but not 
so much about the truth of them. I have been shown that such spirits belong to the province of the Thymus Gland; for the thymus is a gland that is primarily of service to young children, at whose time 
of life that gland is soft. With the spirits who belong to that province a child-like softness is preserved into which a perception of what is good can flow; and from that perception a general impression 
of what is true is created. Those spirits can be in the midst of utter turmoils and yet they themselves are not in any turmoil, as may also be the case with that gland.

Sunt quidam spiritus probi qui cogitant non per meditationem et inde cito et quasi ex non praemeditato enuntiant quae cogitationi obveniunt est illis perceptio interior, quae non ita visualis facta 
est per meditationes et cogitationes sicut apud alios, nam in progressu vitae instructi sunt quasi semet de bonitate rerum, et non ita de veritate earum. Quod tales ad provinciam Glandulae Thema pertineant, 
mihi indicatum est; thymus enim est glandula, quae imprimis inservit infantibus, et in aetate illa mollis est; apud tales etiam est molle infantile remanens, in quod influit perceptio boni, ex 
qua elucet communiter {2}verum; hi in magnis turbis possunt esse, et usque non turbari, sicut etiam glandula illa. @1 corporis$ @2 A d num quod conatus ille, but alters to quod vis et conatus ille$ </p>
