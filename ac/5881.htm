<h3 align="center" class="ired">属天的奥秘 第5881节</h3>
<h4 align="center"></h4><p><strong>5881.</strong>“因为他们在他面前都惊惶”表他们中间的动荡。这从“惊惶”的含义清楚可知，“惊惶”是指动荡；惊惶并非指别的什么。动荡是指对属世层中的真理的重新安排和重整次序；关于重整次序，要知道：世人并不知道记忆知识和真理所在的次序在人的记忆里被排列；但主若乐意，天使是知道的。因为这是一种令人惊叹的次序。记忆知识和真理组合成一束束的，这些小束本身也组合在一起，并且这一切都按着此人所想象的事物的关联。它们组合的方式如此令人惊叹，以至于超出任何人所能想象的。在来世，它们有时呈现给视觉；因为在天堂之光，也就是属灵之光中，诸如此类的事物能被展示给眼睛看见；不过，这在世界的光中是根本不可能的。记忆知识和真理被排列成这些束状形式完全取决于人的爱。对自我的爱和对世界的爱导致它们被排列成地狱的形式，而对邻之爱和对神之爱则使它们被排列成天堂的形式。所以，当人正在重生，内在人的良善正与外在人的真理联结时，真理中间就会发生动荡；因为那时，它们正在经历一种不同的排列，也就是说，正在被重新排列成一种不同的次序。这种动荡就是此处正在描述，并由“他们都惊惶”所表示的。这时所感受到的惊惶通过此前状态的改变，即丧失存在于此前状态中的快乐所产生的焦虑来显现。这种动荡还通过对他们以前所过生活的焦虑来显现，因为他们将内在良善和内在本身贬到其心智的最低部分；下文将论述这种焦虑。</p>

For they were in consternation before him. That this signifies commotion among them, is evident from the signification of "being in consternation," as being commotion, consternation being nothing else. 
By commotion is meant a new disposition and setting in order of truths in the natural, concerning which setting in order be it known that the order in which memory-knowledges and truths are arranged 
in man's memory is unknown to man, but when it pleases the Lord it is known to angels. For it is a wonderful order. They cohere as in little bundles, and the little bundles themselves cohere together, 
and this according to the connection of things which the man had conceived. These coherences are more wonderful than any man can ever believe. In the other life they are sometimes presented to view, 
for in the light of heaven which is spiritual such things can be exhibited to the sight of the eye, but not at all in the light of the world. The memory-knowledges and truths are arranged into these 
fascicular forms solely by the man's loves-into infernal forms by the loves of self and of the world, but into heavenly forms by love toward the neighbor and love to God. Wherefore while the man is being 
regenerated, and conjunction is being effected of the good of the internal man with the truths of the external, a commotion takes place among the truths, for they then undergo a different arrangement. 
It is this commotion which is here meant, and is signified by their "being in consternation." The commotion then made, manifests itself by an anxiety arising from the change of the former state, 
namely, from a privation of the delight which had been in that state. This commotion also manifests itself by anxiety concerning the past life-that internal good and the internal itself had been relegated 
to the lowest place-which anxiety is treated of in what follows. </p>

'For they were filled with dismay at his presence' means turmoil among them. This is clear from the meaning of 'being filled with dismay' as turmoil; dismay is nothing other than this. Turmoil is used 
to mean the rearrangement and reordering of truths within the natural, a reordering about which the following ought to be known: The order in which the factual knowledge and the truths in the human 
memory are arranged is not known by men; but angels know it, if the Lord so pleases. It is an amazing order - facts and truths are grouped together in bundles, as also are the actual bundles; and all 
this in keeping with the interconnection of things of which the person has gained a mental grasp. The way they are grouped together is more amazing than anyone can ever imagine. In the next life visual 
presentations of them sometimes appear; for in the light of heaven, which is a spiritual light, things such as these can be displayed for the eye to see in a way utterly impossible in the light of the 
world. The arrangement of the facts and truths into those bundle-like forms depends entirely on the person's loves. Self-love and love of the world leads to their being arranged into hellish forms, 
whereas love towards the neighbour and love to God leads to their being arranged into heavenly ones. Consequently when a person is being regenerated and the good of the internal man is becoming joined 
to the truths of the external man, turmoil develops among the truths; for they are being rearranged into a different order. This turmoil is what is being described here and is meant by their being filled 
with dismay. The dismay which comes to be felt at this time reveals itself through anxiety arising out of the change in the state immediately before; that is to say, it arises out of being deprived 
of the delight which had been present in that state. The same turmoil also reveals itself through anxiety over the life they had previously led, in that they had relegated internal good and the internal 
itself to the lowest parts of their minds - an anxiety dealt with in what follows. </p>

`Quia consternati a coram illo': quod significet commotionem inter illa, constat ex significatione `consternari' quod sit commotio; consternatio non aliud est; per commotionem intelligitur nova dispositio 
et ordinatio verorum in naturali; de qua ordinatione {1}hoc sciendum: quo ordine scientifica et vera in memoria hominis disposita sunt, homo non scit, at angeli cum Domino beneplacet, id sciunt, 
est enim ordo mirabilis, cohaerent fasciculatim, et quoque ipsi fasciculi inter se, et hoc secundum rerum nexum quem homo ceperat; cohaerentiae hae sunt mirabiliores quam usquam aliquis homo credere 
potest; in altera vita sistuntur illae quandoque videri, nam in luce caeli quae spiritualis, talia possunt ad oculi visum exhiberi, nequaquam in luce mundi; scientifica et vera in formas {2}hasce fasciculares 
unice ordinantur ab amoribus hominis; in formas infernales ab amoribus sui et mundi, in formas autem caelestes ab amore {3}erga proximum et amore in Deum; quapropter cum homo regeneratur et 
conjunctio fit boni interni hominis cum veris externi, fit commotio inter vera, nam tunc aliter ordinantur; haec commotio est quae hic intelligitur, et significatur per quod `consternati fuerint': (m)commotio 
illa quae tunc existit, {4}manifestat se per anxietatem oriundam ex mutatione prioris status, {5}nempe ex privatione jucundi quod fuerat in illo statu; {6}commotio etiam illa se manifestat per 
anxietatem de vita anteacta, quod bonum {7}internum et ipsum internum ad infima relegaverint, de qua anxietate {8} in sequentibus agitur.(n) @1 sciendum est$ @2 has$ @3 in$ @4 est praecipue anxietas
