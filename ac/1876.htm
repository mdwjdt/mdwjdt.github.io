<h3 align="center" class="ired">属天的奥秘 第1876节</h3>
<h4 align="center"></h4><p><strong>1876.</strong>以人类的语言形式出现在圣言中的人名、国名或城名，在它们上升的那一刻就消失不见了。因为这些名字是世俗、肉体和物质的，灵魂进入来世后会逐渐脱去这些事物，而那些进入天堂的人则完全脱去。天使甚至对人及其名字没有丝毫概念，他们不再知道亚伯兰、以撒或雅各是谁。相反，他们会通过圣言中这些人物所代表和表示的事物为自己形成一个概念。当他们进入天堂时，这些名字和这些话就象灰尘，或脱落的鳞片。由此可见，在圣言中，名字无非表示真实事物。我曾与天使多次谈论这些话题，并从他们那里得到有关真理的充分指教。灵人之间的对话并非由话语构成，而是由观念构成，就象构成人的思维、没有话语的那些观念，因此是所有语言的普遍语言。但当他们与世人说话时，其言语会落入这个人的语言的话语中，如前所述（<a href="1635.htm">1635</a>，<a href="1637.htm">1637</a>，<a href="1639.htm">1639</a>节）。<br />与灵人们讨论这个话题时，我可以说，他们彼此交谈时，甚至无法说出一个人类语言的单词，更不用说名字了。其中一些灵人闻言大为震惊，于是就离开并试图这样做。但他们返回时声称，他们无法发音，因为这些话如此粗糙、物质化，以至于在他们自己的气场之下。这种话语是由身体器官发出音来，然后通过空气传播而形成的，或通过经由通向听觉器官的内在途径进入这类器官的流注而形成的。由此清楚可知，出现在圣言中的任何一句话，丝毫无法传给灵人，更无法传给天使灵，天使灵的言语更为普遍（<a href="1642.htm">1642</a>节），最不能传给天使（<a href="1643.htm">1643</a>节）。对天使来说，灵人最初的观念丝毫不会存留，相反，他们拥有属灵的真理和属天的良善。这些真理和良善以其最细微的形式用无法形容的方式发生变化。这些细微形式是连续的，并连同代表物的最初泉源一起被揉合在和谐的系列中。这些代表物的巨大快乐和美丽是从相爱的幸福流入的，而幸福则是从快乐和美丽流入的，因为他们被主的生命所激励。</p>

<p><strong>[NCE]1876.</strong> Like the words of human language, the names of people,{*1} countries, and cities in the Word vanish at the very first threshold of their upward path. Names are some of those earthly, bodily, material things that the soul gradually sheds as it enters the next life, and sheds completely if it goes to heaven. Angels do not hold on to the slightest mental image of people in the Word, so they do not retain the least idea of their names. What Abram is, what Isaac, and Jacob are, they no longer know. It is the qualities represented and symbolized by figures in the Word that form an angel's picture. Names and words are like chaff or scales that drop off when [the ideas] enter heaven.<br />This shows that names in the Word have no meaning besides a symbolic one. I have spoken about this many times with angels, and they have taught me the truth very fully.<br />When spirits talk to each other, they use not words but thoughts, of the kind we have when we are thinking wordlessly. Their speech, then, is common to all languages. When spirits talk to a person on earth, their speech falls into the words of the person's language, as noted in <a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_1876/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_1635" target=_top>1635</a>, <a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_1876/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_1637" target=_top>1637</a>, <a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_1876/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_1639" target=_top>1639</a>.<br />[2] When I talked with the spirits about this, I was inspired to say that as long as they were conversing among themselves, they could not pronounce even a single word of human language, still less a name. Astonished to hear this, some of them went away and tried it. They came back admitting they could not, because human words were too coarse, too tied to the material world to rise into their sphere of existence. Such words are formed from the sound of air, articulated by physical organs; or else they are formed by an inflow into the same organs traveling an internal pathway to the organs of hearing.<br />This also made it clear that not a syllable of Scripture could cross over to spirits, still less to angelic spirits, whose speech is even more universal (<a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_1876/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_1642" target=_top>1642</a>). Least of all could it reach angels (<a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_1876/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_1643" target=_top>1643</a>),{*2} with whom it retains none of the initial thoughts entertained by spirits. Among angels, such thoughts are replaced with spiritual truth and heavenly goodness that vary in indescribable ways in their very smallest forms. These forms are linked and connected in a harmonious series with the source elements from which representations are created. The happiness of mutual love renders the representations extremely sweet and beautiful, and sweetness and beauty render them happy, because their sources are animated by life from the Lord.<br /><br /><strong>Footnotes:</strong><br />{*1} The Latin word translated as "people" here is viri, a word the author usually reserves for males. See note 1 in <a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_1876/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_40" target=_top>40</a>. [LHC]<br />{*2} The description that follows resembles that of <a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_1876/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_1643" target=_top>1643</a>, but Swedenborg there assigns the style of speech to angelic spirits rather than angels. He may also be thinking of <a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_1876/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_1645" target=_top>1645</a>. [LHC] </p>

The names of men, of kingdoms, and of cities, that occur in the Word, like the words of human speech, perish at the very threshold of the ascent; for these are earthly, corporeal, and material; and the 
souls that come into the other life successively put these things off, and those who come into heaven do so altogether. The angels retain not even the least of an idea of any person, nor consequently 
of his name. What Abram is, what Isaac, and Jacob, they no longer know. They form an idea for themselves from the things which are represented and signified by them in the Word. Names and words are 
to them like dust, or like scales, which fall off when they enter heaven. Hence it may be seen that by the names in the Word nothing is signified except actual things. I have frequently spoken with angels 
about these matters, and have been fully instructed by them concerning the truth. The speech of spirits with one another is not a speech of words, but of ideas, such as are those of human thought 
without words, on which account it is the universal of all languages. But when they speak with a man, their speech falls into the words of the man's language (as before said, n. 1635, 1637, 1639).  [2] 
When I have spoken with spirits about this, it has been given me to say that when they are conversing with one another, they cannot utter even one single word of human language, still less any name. 
Some of them, wondering at this, retired and tried; but returning they said that they were not able to pronounce them because the words were so grossly material that they were below their sphere, 
as they were formed from the sound of air, made articulate by the bodily organs, or by influx into such organs by an internal way leading to the organ of hearing. From this it may likewise be clearly 
seen that no part of a word that is in the Word can pass to spirits, still less to angelic spirits, whose speech is still more universal (see n. 1642), and least of all to the angels (see n. 1643), with 
whom remains nothing of the first ideas of spirits, but in place of them spiritual truths and celestial goods, which are varied in an ineffable manner in the least forms, continued and connected in 
a unanimous series, with the originaries of representatives that are most pleasant and beautiful from the happiness of mutual love, and that are happy from pleasantnesses and beauties, because they are 
inspired with the life of the Lord. </p>

The names of men, kingdoms, or cities that occur in the Word, as with the expressions of human speech, disappear at the very threshold of their progress upwards; for those names are earthly, bodily, 
and material, being things of which souls entering the next life gradually divest themselves and of which those entering heaven do so altogether. Angels do not retain the least idea of any person, nor 
therefore of his name. What Abram is, what Isaac is, or Jacob, they do not know any longer. Instead they form an idea for themselves from the things that are represented and meant by those characters 
in the Word. Names and expressions are like dust or like scales that fall off when they enter heaven. From this it becomes clear that names in the Word mean nothing other than real things. On these matters 
I have spoken many times to angels, who have informed me fully regarding the truth. The speech that spirits employ among themselves does not consist of verbal expressions but of ideas, like those 
comprising human thought without words, and is therefore the universal language of all languages. But when they speak to man their speech falls into the expressions of human language, as stated in <a href="1635.htm">1635</a>, <a href="1637.htm">1637</a>, <a href="1639.htm">1639</a>. </p>

 When discussing this matter with spirits I have been given to say that when they are conversing among themselves they are not able to utter one single word of human language, 
still less utter any name. Astonished by this some went away and tried to do so, but on returning they said that they had been unable to pronounce them because those words were so grossly material that 
they belonged below their own sphere, for such words were produced by an audible emission of air articulated by organs of the body, or else by means of an influx into the same organs by an internal 
route leading to the organ of hearing. From this it also became perfectly clear that no part of any expression which occurs in the Word was able to pass over to spirits. Still less could it pass over 
to angelic spirits, whose speech is even more universal, <a href="1642.htm">1642</a>. And least of all could it pass over to angels, <a href="1643.htm">1643</a>, with whom nothing remains of even the first ideas that spirits possess; instead angels 
have spiritual truths and celestial goods. Such truths and goods are varied in an indescribable manner in their least forms - which are continuous and knit together in a harmonious sequence - together 
with the first springs of representatives whose very great delightfulness and beauty flow from the happiness belonging to mutual love, and whose happiness flows from all their delight and beauty, 
because the Lord's life is inspired into them </p>

Nomina virorum, regnorum, urbium, quae in Verbo, similiter ac voces loquelae humanae, pereunt in primo limine cum ascendunt; sunt enim terrestria, corporea et materialia, quae successive (x)exuunt 
animae quae veniunt in alteram vitam, et prorsus illi quae veniunt in caelum; angeli ne minimum ideae alicujus personae, proinde ejus nominis, retinent; quid Abram, quid Isac, et Jacob, non amplius sciunt; 
formant sibi ideam ex illis quae per illos in Verbo repraesentantur et significantur; sunt nomina et voces sicut grumi seu sicut squamae, quae decidunt cum intrant in caelum: inde constare potest 
quod per nomina in Verbo nihil aliud quam res significentur; de quibus multoties cum angelis locutus, a quibus de veritate plene instructus sum.  Loquela spirituum inter se non est vocum sed est idearum 
quales sunt cogitationis humanae absque vocibus, quare universalis est omnium linguarum; at cum loquuntur cum homine, cadit eorum loquela in voces linguae hominis, ut dictum n. 1635, 1637, 1639; 
[2] cum de hoc locutus cum spiritibus, dicere datum est quod dum colloquuntur inter se, ne unam quidem vocem linguae humanae, minus adhuc aliquod nomen, possent enuntiare, quod quidam eorum mirati, recesserunt, 
et tentabant, sed redeuntes dicebant quod non pronuntiare potuerint, quia voces illae crassius materiales, ut essent infra sphaeram eorum ex sono aeris per organa corporea articulato, aut per 
influxum in talia per viam ducentem ad auditus organum internam formatae: inde clare quoque constare potuit quod nihil vocis quae in Verbo, transire posset ad spiritus, minus ad spiritus angelicos, 
quorum loquela adhuc universalior est, n. 1642, minime ad angelos, n. 1643, apud quos nihil remanet de ideis primis spirituum sed loco eorum spiritualia vera, et caelestia bona, quae ineffabili modo, 
formis minimis, continuis, connexis in unanima serie, cum originariis repraesentativorum ex felicitate amoris mutui amoenissimorum et pulcherrimorum, et e amoenitatibus et pulchritudinibus felicium, 
quia vita Domini inspiratis, variantur. </p>
