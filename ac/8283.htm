<h3 align="center" class="ired">属天的奥秘 第8283节</h3>
<h4 align="center"></h4><p><strong>8283.</strong>“你大发威严，摧毁那些起来攻击你的”表与神性对立的事物被祂抛弃，如同一文不值的东西。这从“大发威严”、“摧毁”和“那些起来攻击的”的含义清楚可知：“大发威严”是指在掌控反对祂的事物的能力方面的神性；“摧毁”是指抛弃，如同一文不值的东西；“那些起来攻击的”是指那些进行反对的人，因而是指反对的事物。</p>

<p align="center"><b>Potts(1905-1910) 8283</b></p><p><b>8283.</b>
And in the multitude of Thine excellency Thou destroyest those who rise up against Thee. That this signifies that by virtue of the Divine, things opposed are rejected as nothing, is evident from the 
signification of "the multitude of excellency," as being the Divine as to power over those things which oppose themselves to Him; from the signification of "to destroy," as being to reject as nothing; 
and from the signification of "those who rise up against," as being those who oppose themselves, thus things opposed. </p>

<p align="center"><b>Elliott(1983-1999) 8283</b></p><p><b>8283.</b>
'And in the greatness of Your excellence You destroy those rising up against You' means that things opposed to the Divine are cast aside by Him as worthless. This is clear from the meaning of 'the greatness 
of excellence' as the Divine in respect of His power over things that are opposed to Him; from the meaning of 'destroying' as casting aside as worthless; and from the meaning of 'those rising 
up' as those who are opposed, thus as things that are opposed. </p>

<p align="center"><b>Latin(1748-1756) 8283</b>
</p><b>8283.</b>
`Et in multitudine excellentiae Tuae destruis insurgentes Tibi': quod significet quod ex Divino opposita ut nihili rejiciantur, constat ex significatione `multitudinis excellentiae' quod sit Divinum 
quoad {1}potentiam super illa quae se Illi opponunt; ex significatione `destruere' quod sit ut nihili rejicere; et ex significatione `insurgentium' quod sint qui se opponunt, ita opposita. 	@1 supereminentiam$ </p>
