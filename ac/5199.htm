<h3 align="center" class="ired">属天的奥秘 第5199节</h3>
<h4 align="center"></h4><p><strong>5199.</strong>“长相俊美”表属于信之物。这从“俊美”和“长相”的含义清楚可知。属灵的“俊美”本质上是对内层真理的情感，属灵的“长相”本质是信仰；因此，“长相俊美”表示对信之真理的情感（参看<a href="553.htm">553</a>，<a href="3080.htm">3080</a>，<a href="3821.htm">3821</a>，<a href="4985.htm">4985</a>节）。属灵的俊美之所以是对内层真理的情感，是因为真理是良善所取的外在形式。从天堂里的神性所得来的良善本身为天使提供他们所拥有的生命；但这生命所取的外在形式则由源于该良善的真理来提供。然而，俊美不是由信之真理产生的，而是由源于良善的信之真理里面的情感本身产生的。单单由信之真理所产生的俊美就像彩绘或雕塑脸的俊美；而由对源于良善的真理的情感所产生的俊美则像被天堂之爱赋予生气的鲜活脸的俊美；因为爱或从脸的形式闪耀出来的情感如何，俊美就如何。正因如此，天使的外表美得难以形容。他们的脸闪耀出经由信之真理传来的爱之良善；这良善与真理不仅呈现于眼前，还能从他们所发出的气场被感觉到。<br />这之所以是俊美的源头，是因为天堂整体上是大人，与人的每一个部分都有一个对应关系。因此，凡拥有爱之良善，并因此拥有信之真理的人都拥有天堂的形式，因而被赋予天堂所拥有的美丽，因为在天堂，从主发出的神性是全部中的全部。这也解释了为何地狱里的人因是良善与真理的对立面而丑陋得可怕；在天堂之光中，他们看上去不像人，而是像怪物。属灵的“长相”之所以是信仰，是因为就内在意义而言，“看”和“看见”表示理解，就更内在的意义而言，表示拥有信仰（参看<a href="897.htm">897</a>，<a href="2150.htm">2150</a>，<a href="2325.htm">2325</a>，<a href="2807.htm">2807</a>，<a href="3863.htm">3863</a>，<a href="3869.htm">3869</a>，<a href="4403.htm">4403</a>-<a href="4421.htm">4421</a>节）。</p>

Beautiful in look. That this signifies that were of faith, is evident from the signification of "beauty" and of "look." Spiritual beauty is the affection of interior truth, and spiritual look is faith; 
hence by "beautiful in look" is signified the affection of the truth of faith (see n. 553, 3080, 3821, 4985). That spiritual beauty is the affection of interior truth, is because truth is the form 
of good. Good itself which is from the Divine in heaven is that from which angels have life; but the form of their life is given by means of the truths which are from this good. And yet beauty is not 
produced by the truth of faith, but by the affection itself within the truths of faith, which is from good. Beauty that is from the truth of faith alone is like that of a painted or sculptured face; but 
beauty from the affection of truth, which is from good, is like that of a living face animated by heavenly love; for such as is the love or affection that beams from the form of the face, such is the 
beauty. From this it is that the angels appear in ineffable beauty; from their faces beams forth the good of love through the truth of faith, which not only appear before the sight, but are also perceived 
from the spheres coming from them. The reason why they have beauty from this is that the universal heaven is a Grand Man, and corresponds to all things in man both in general and in particular; 
and therefore the man who is in the good of love, and hence in the truth of faith, is in the form of heaven, and consequently is in the beauty in which heaven is, where the Divine from the Lord is all 
in all. It is for this reason also that they who are in hell, being against good and truth, are horribly ugly; and that in the light of heaven they appear not as men, but as monsters. The reason why 
spiritual looking is faith, is that in the internal sense "to look" and "to see" are to understand, and in a still more interior sense are to have faith (see n. 897, 2150, 2325, 2807, 3863, 3869, 4403-4421). </p>

'Beautiful in appearance' means which are expressions of faith. This is clear from the meaning of 'beauty' and 'appearance'. Spiritual 'beauty' is essentially an affection for interior truth, while spiritual 
'appearance' is essentially faith, so that 'beautiful in appearance' means an affection for the truth of faith, see <a href="553.htm">553</a>, <a href="3080.htm">3080</a>, <a href="3821.htm">3821</a>, <a href="4985.htm">4985</a>. The reason spiritual beauty is an affection for interior 
truth is that truth is the outward form taken by good. The good which they receive in heaven from the Divine provides angels with the life they possess; but the outward form taken by that life is 
provided by the truths springing from that good. The truth of faith however does not provide the beauty but the affection itself present within the truths of faith springing from good. Beauty that is 
provided solely by the truth of faith is like the beauty of a face seen in a painting or a sculpture, but the beauty provided by an affection for truth springing from good is like the beauty of a real 
face full of life imparted to it by heavenly love; for as is the love - that is, as is the affection - which shines out of the form provided by the face, so is the beauty seen there. This being so, 
the outward appearance of the angels is indescribably beautiful. Their faces are radiant with the good of love passing through the truth of faith, which good and truth not only present themselves visually 
but can also be felt from the spheres that emanate from them. </p>

<p><b>[2]</b>
 The reason why this is the source of beauty is that heaven in its entirety is the Grand Man and has a correspondence with every 
single part of the human being. Everyone therefore who has the good of love and for that reason the truth of faith present in him has the form which heaven possesses present within him; and as a consequence 
of this there is also imparted to him the beauty which heaven possesses, heaven being a place where the Divine going forth from the Lord is the All in all. This also explains why those in hell, 
being the opposite of what is good and true, are horribly ugly, and in the light of heaven do not look like human beings but like monsters. The reason why spiritual appearance (aspectus) is faith is 
that in the internal sense 'looking at (aspicere) and seeing' means understanding, and in a sense more internal than this having faith is meant, see <a href="897.htm">897</a>, <a href="2150.htm">2150</a>, <a href="2315.htm">2315</a>, <a href="2807.htm">2807</a>, <a href="3863.htm">3863</a>, <a href="3869.htm">3869</a>, <a href="4403.htm">4403</a>-<a href="4421.htm">4421</a>. </p>

`Pulchrae aspectu': quod significet quae fidei, constat ex significatione `pulchritudinis' et `aspectus'; pulchritudo spiritualis est affectio veri interioris, et aspectus spiritualis est fides; inde 
per `pulchras aspectu' significatur affectio veri fidei, videatur n. 553, 3080, 3821, 4985; quod pulchritudo spiritualis sit affectio veri interioris, est inde quia verum est forma boni; ipsum bonum 
quod a Divino in caelo, est a quo vita est angelis, sed forma vitae illorum est per vera quae a bono illo; (m){1}ast verum fidei non facit pulchritudinem sed ipsa affectio quae inest veris fidei quae 
est a bono; pulchritudo ex solo vero fidei se habet sicut pulchritudo faciei pictae vel sculptae; sed pulchritudo ex affectione veri quae ex bono, se habet sicut pulchritudo faciei vivae animatae (c)ab 
amore caelesti, nam qualis {2}amor seu qualis affectio elucet ex forma faciei, talis est pulchritudo(n); inde est quod angeli appareant pulchritudine ineffabili; ex faciebus illorum elucet bonum amoris 
per verum fidei quae non solum coram visu apparent sed etiam percipiuntur a sphaeris quae ex illis; [2] causa quod inde pulchritudo, est quia universum caelum est Maximus Homo et correspondet omnibus 
et singulis apud hominem; qui itaque in bono amoris et inde in vero fidei est, in forma caeli est, consequenter in pulchritudine in qua caelum ubi Divinum a Domino est Omne in omnibus; inde quoque 
est quod qui in inferno sunt, quia contra bonum et verum, sint deformitate horrenda, et quod in luce caeli non appareant sicut homines sed sicut monstra.  Quod aspectus spiritualis sit fides, est quia 
`aspicere et videre' in sensu interno est intelligere, ac in sensu adhuc interiore, fidem habere, videatur n. 897, 2150, 2325, 2807, 3863, 3869, 4403-4421. @1 at$ @2 affectio seu amor$ </p>
