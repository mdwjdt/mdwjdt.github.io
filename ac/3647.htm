<h3 align="center" class="ired">属天的奥秘 第3647节</h3>
<h4 align="center"></h4><p><strong>3647.</strong>在这些问题上的情形也被展示给我。我被允许看到并发现一些刚刚进入来世的人，他们活在肉身时只关注地上的事物，没有其它目的，也没有通过任何知识被引入良善与真理。他们原是普普通通的水手和农民。如我所觉察到的，他们似乎拥有极少的生命，以至于我怀疑他们不可能像其他灵人那样接受永生。他们就像机器，少有生气。但天使对他们极为关照体贴，通过他们作为人所拥有的能力将其引入良善和真理的生命。他们以这种方式被引领，越来越远离动物式的生命，并进入人类生命。</p>

How the case is with these things has also been shown. It was given me to see and perceive certain ones as they entered into the other life who in the life of the body had regarded only earthly things 
and had had nothing else as their end; nor had they been initiated by means of any knowledges into good and truth. They had belonged to the common crowd of sailors and of peasants. They appeared (as 
was also perceived) to have so little life that I thought it impossible for them to receive eternal life like other spirits, being like machines, little animated; but the angels had tender care for them, 
and through the faculty which they possessed as men insinuated into them the life of good and truth, whereby they were more and more led on from a life like that of animals to human life. </p>

The situation in these matters too has been shown to me. I have been allowed to see and observe certain persons who have just entered the next life - who during their lifetime paid attention solely to 
earthly things and who had no other end in view and had not been introduced into what is good or true through any knowledge of this. They had been sailors and farm labourers. They seemed, as also I 
perceived, to possess so little life that I presumed them to be incapable of sharing like other spirits in eternal life. They resembled machines almost at a stand-still. But angels showed great concern 
for them, and by means of an ability which they possessed as men were instilling the life of good and truth into the new arrivals. In this way these were being led more and more away from a life like 
that of animals into human life. </p>

{1}Quomodo (c)illa se habent, etiam ostensum est; datum erat videre et appercipere quosdam qui in alteram vitam tunc venerunt, qui in vita corporis cui spectarunt solum ad terrestria, et nihil aliud 
pro fine habuerunt, nec fuerunt per aliquas cognitiones in bonum et verum initiati; ex nautica et rustica {2}turba fuerunt; apparuerunt, sicut etiam perceptum, quod tam parum vitae haberent ut putarem 
quod non possent sicut alii spiritus vitam aeternam sortiri, erant sicut machinae parum animatae; sed {3}angeli curam illorum sollicite habebant, et per facultatem quam sicut homines habebant, boni et 
veri vitam illis insinuabant, inde magis et magis perducebantur a vita animalium simili in vitam humanam. @1 All this is in margin in A$ @2 simplice turba fuit$ @3 i usque$ </p>
