<h3 align="center" class="ired">属天的奥秘 第4126节</h3>
<h4 align="center"></h4><p><strong>4126.</strong>“对他说，你要小心，不可对雅各说好说歹”表不再有任何交流。这从“说好说歹”的含义清楚可知，“说好说歹”是指谈论良善，思想邪恶，由此最终谈论并行出邪恶，因为凡思想邪恶者，最终会谈论并行出邪恶。像这样的人都不再与别人结合，因为将人们结合在一起的，是思维和意愿，而不是话语。的确，在世上话语会将人们结合起来，但只有在听者相信说话者也思想并意愿良善的情况下才行。而在来世，一切思维都是显而易见的，因为思维通过某种气场交流，该气场是此人所发出的属灵气场，并显明其思想和性情的性质，也就是其意愿和思维的性质。因此，结合是照着这个气场而实现的。由此明显可知，“不可说好说歹”在内义上表示不再有任何交流。</p>

<p align="center"><b>Potts(1905-1910) 4126</b></p><p><b>4126.</b>
And said unto him, Take heed to thyself lest thou speak with Jacob from good even to evil. That this signifies that there was no longer any communication, is evident from the signification of "speaking 
from good even to evil," as being to speak good and think evil, and from this at last to speak evil and do evil; for he who thinks evil, at last speaks it and does it. He who is such is no longer conjoined 
with another, because it is thought and will which conjoin, but not words. In the world indeed words conjoin, but only when the hearer believes that the speaker also thinks good and wills good. 
But in the other life all thought is manifest, for it is communicated by a certain sphere (which is a spiritual sphere) that proceeds from the person and makes manifest of what kind of disposition 
(that is, of what kind of will and thought) he is; and conjunction is therefore effected in accordance with this sphere. From this it is manifest that by the words, "lest thou speak from good even to 
evil," is signified in the internal sense that there was no longer any communication. </p>

<p align="center"><b>Elliott(1983-1999) 4126</b></p><p><b>4126.</b>
'And said to him, Take care not to speak to Jacob either good or evil' means that no communication existed any longer. This is clear from the meaning of 'speaking either good or evil' as speaking good 
but thinking evil, and at length consequently speaking evil and practicing it. For anyone who thinks evil at length speaks it and practices it. Anyone like this is no longer joined to another, since 
it is people's thought and also their will which join them together, not their words. In the world words do, it is true, join people together, but in this case the hearer believes that the speaker also 
thinks good and wills it. But in the next life all thought stands revealed, for it is communicated by a certain kind of sphere, a spiritual sphere which emanates from another and reveals the nature 
of his inclination and mind, that is, of his will and thought. Consequently it is in accordance with this sphere that he becomes joined to others. From this it is evident that the words forbidding Laban 
'to speak good or evil' in the internal sense mean that no communication existed any longer. </p>

<p align="center"><b>Latin(1748-1756) 4126</b>
</p><b>4126.</b>
`Et dixit ei, Cave tibi ne forte loquaris cum Jacobo a bono usque ad malum': quod significet quod nulla communicatio amplius, constat ea significatione `loqui a bono usque ad malum' quod sit loqui 
bonum et cogitare malum, et inde tandem loqui malum et facere malum; qui enim cogitat malum, is tandem loquitur id et facit id; </p>
<p>qui talis est, non amplius conjunctus est cum altero, quia cogitatio 
est et voluntas {1} quae conjungunt, non autem verba; in mundo quidem bonum et velit bonum; at {2} in altera vita omnis cogitatio patet, nam communicatur per quandam sphaeram, quae est sphaera spiritualis 
quae ab altero procedit {3} et manifestat quali animo, hoc est, quali voluntate et cogitatione est; quare secundum illam fit conjunctio: inde patet quod per haec verba, `ne loquaris a bono 
usque ad malum' in sensu interno significetur quod nulla communicatio amplius.      @1 et voluntas est$      @2 sed$      @3 ut ita dicatur, exhalat$ </p>
