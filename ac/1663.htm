<h3 align="center" class="ired">属天的奥秘 第1663节</h3>
<h4 align="center"></h4><p><strong>1663.</strong>“他们都攻打所多玛王比拉、蛾摩拉王比沙、押玛王示纳、洗扁王善以别和比拉王；比拉就是琐珥”表如此多种恶欲和谬念，主要与之争战。这同样从所提及的这些王和这些民族的含义，以及下文清楚可知。至于它们各自表示哪种恶欲和哪种谬念，这解释起来同样太过冗长。前面简要论述了所多玛和蛾摩拉，押玛和洗扁，以及琐珥的含义。它们是最一般，或最普遍的那种恶与假；在内义上所表示的这些事物在此遵循自己的顺序。<br />主经历并忍受最严厉的试探，比任何人所承受的还要严厉。从圣言无法清楚得知这一事实，圣言只提到祂在旷野四十昼夜，受魔鬼试探。虽然那时经上只用寥寥几句话描述了祂所经历的试探，但这几句话却将它们全都囊括进来了；如马可福音（<a href="http://39-27.cn/可1.12.htm">1:12</a>，<a href="http://39-27.cn/可1.13.htm">13</a>）记载，祂在那里与野兽同在，野兽是指最坏的地狱团伙；还有后来（马太福音和路加福音）所记载的事，即魔鬼将祂带到殿顶和高山上，这些事无非代表祂在旷野所经历的最严厉的试探；对此，蒙主怜悯，以后再予以描述。</p><br />

<p><strong>[NCE]1663.</strong> They made war with Bera, king of Sodom; and with Birsha, king of Gomorrah; Shinab, king of Admah; and Shemeber, king of Zeboiim; and the king of Bela (which is Zoar), symbolizes just so many categories of evil desire and distorted conviction that the Lord fought against. This too can be seen from the symbolism of the kings and nations mentioned here, and from what follows as well. Again, explaining precisely which evil desire or distorted persuasion each of them symbolizes would take too long. The symbolism of Sodom and Gomorrah, of Admah and Zeboiim, and of Zoar has been touched on already [搂搂<a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_1663/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_1212" target=_top>1212</a>, <a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_1663/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_1589" target=_top>1589</a>]. It is the most general or universal categories of evil and falsity that are symbolized on the inner level here, and they follow one another in order.<br />[2] The Lord underwent and suffered trials heavier than those of anyone else in the universe 钬?the heaviest of all 钬?but this is not well known from the Word, which merely notes that he was in the wilderness for forty days, where he was tested by the Devil [<a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_1663/bible_king-james-version_matthew_4_1-2" target=_top>Matthew 4:1-2</a>; <a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_1663/bible_king-james-version_mark_1_12-13" target=_top>Mark 1:12-13</a>; <a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_1663/bible_king-james-version_luke_4_1-2" target=_top>Luke 4:1-2</a>]. The actual trials that he then experienced are not described in more than a few words, but those few cover everything.

Subsequent details 钬?that the Devil led him onto the spires of the temple and onto a tall mountain 钬?are nothing but images representing the terrible crises he faced in the wilderness [<a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_1663/bible_king-james-version_matthew_4_3-11" target=_top>Matthew 4:3-11</a>; <a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_1663/bible_king-james-version_luke_4_3-13" target=_top>Luke 4:3-13</a>].

They made war with Bera king of Sodom, and with Birsha king of Gomorrah, Shinab king of Admah, and Shemeber king of Zeboiim, and the king of Bela, this is Zoar. That these signify so many kinds of cupidities 
of evil and of persuasions of falsity, against which the Lord fought, may likewise be seen from the signification of the kings and nations here named, and also from what follows. What cupidity 
of evil and what persuasion of falsity is signified by each one, it would also be too tedious to set forth. Of the signification of Sodom and Gomorrah, of Admah and Zeboiim, and of Zoar, we have already 
briefly treated. They are the most general or the most universal kinds of evils and falsities; and these, being signified in the internal sense, here follow in their series.  [2] That the Lord underwent 
and endured the most grievous temptations-temptations more grievous than have ever been endured by anyone-is not so well known from the Word, where it is only mentioned that He was in the wilderness 
forty days, and was tempted by the devil. The temptations themselves which He then had, are described in a few words only; but these few involve them all; as that it is said in Mark (1:12, 13) 
that He was there with the beasts, by which are signified the worst of the infernal crew; and the things which are mentioned [in Matthew and in Luke], that He was taken by the devil upon the pinnacles 
of the temple, and upon a high mountain, are nothing but representatives of most grievous temptations which He had in the wilderness; concerning which, of the Lord's Divine mercy hereafter. </p>

'That these made war with Bera king of Sodom, and with Birsha king of Gomorrah, Shinab king of Admah, and Shemeber king of Zeboiim, and the king of Bela, that is, Zoar' means just so many kinds of evil 
desires and false persuasions against which the Lord fought. This too becomes clear from the meaning of these kings and these nations that are mentioned, and from what follows as well. Which particular 
evil desires and which particular false persuasions are meant by each individual one would also take too long to explain. The meaning of Sodom and Gomorrah, also of Admah and Zeboiim, as well as 
Zoar, has been dealt with briefly already. They are the most general or most universal kinds of evils and falsities; and these, which are meant in the internal sense, here follow in their own sequence. </p>

<p><b>[2]</b>
The fact that the Lord underwent and suffered the severest of temptations, more severe than anybody else has ever done, is not so well known from the Word, where all that is mentioned is His 
being in the wilderness forty days and being tempted by the devil. But although the temptations He experienced at that time have been described only briefly, those brief statements nevertheless embody 
all, as in <a href="http://bible.gospelcom.net/cgi-bin/bible?passage=Mark%201:12,%2013&amp;version=ESV&amp;interface=print&amp;showfn=yes&amp;showxref">Mark 1:12, 13</a>, which records that He was there with wild animals, which mean the worst of the hellish crew. And the events afterwards recorded about the devil taking Him up on to the pinnacles 
of the temple and on to a high mountain are nothing else than representatives of very severe temptations He experienced in the wilderness, which will in the Lord's Divine mercy be described later on </p>

'Fecerunt bellum cum Bera rege Sodomae, et cum Birsha rege Amorae, Shinab rege Admae, et Shemeber rege Zeboiim, e rege Belae, haec Zoar': quod significent totidem genera cupiditatum mali et persuasionum 
falsi contra quae Dominus pugnavit, constare quoque potest a significatione horum regum et harum gentium qua nominantur, ut et a sequentibus; quaenam cupiditates mali et quaenam persuasiones falsi 
per singulas significentur, etiam prolixum nimis foret exponere; de significatione Sodomae et Amorae, tum Admae e Zeboiim, ut et Zoar, paucis prius actum est; sunt genera communissima seu maxime universalia 
malorum et falsorum, quae in sensu interno significata hic sua serie sequuntur.  [2] Quod Dominus prae omnibus in universo graviores aut gravissimas tentationes subierit et sustinuerit non ita 
notum est ex Verbo, ubi solum memoratur quod in deserto fuerit quadraginta dies et tentatus a diabolo; ipsae tentationes quas tunc habuit, non descriptae sunt quam paucis, quae tamen pauca involvunt 
omnia, sicut quod memoratur apud Marc. i 12, 13, quod 'ibi fuerit cum bestiis,' per quas significantur pessimi ab infernali turba; et quae dein memorantur quod 'a diabolo ductus super pinnas templi et 
super montem altum' sunt nihil aliud quam repraesentativa gravissimarum tentationum quas habuit in deserto, de quibus, ex Divina Domini Misericordia, in sequentibus. </p>
