<h3 align="center" class="ired">属天的奥秘 第5852节</h3>
<h4 align="center"></h4><p><strong>5852.</strong>与人同在的恶灵的确来自地狱，但当与人同在时，他们并不在地狱，而是从地狱被召唤出来。那时他们所在的地方在地狱与天堂的中间，被称为灵人界；我们在前面经常提到灵人界。被称为灵人界的这个世界也有善灵，这些善灵同样与人同在。人们死后也直接进入灵人界，在此逗留一段时间后，各人照各人所过的生活要么被赶到低地，要么被送入地狱，要么被提入天堂。灵人界是地狱的上界，照主的美意，地狱在那里被封闭或关闭；灵人界也是天堂的下界；因此，它是将天堂与地狱区分开来的中间地带。由此可知何为灵人界。当与一个人同在的恶灵在灵人界时，他们不会受到任何地狱的折磨，而是享受爱自己爱世界的快乐，以及从此人自己所喜欢的乐趣那里所获得的快乐；因为他们就存在于此人的一切思维和一切情感之中。但当他们被送回其地狱时，就会回到他们之前的状态。</p>

The evil spirits with man are indeed from the hells, but while they are with him they are not in hell, but taken out from thence. The place where they then are is midway between hell and heaven, and 
is called the World Of Spirits, of which mention has often been made before. In this world called the world of spirits there are also good spirits who likewise are with man. Into that world also come 
men immediately after death, who after tarrying a while there, are either sent away into the lower earth, or are let down into hell, or taken up into heaven, each one according to his life. In that world 
the hells are terminated above, being there closed or opened at the good pleasure of the Lord; and in that world heaven is terminated below; thus it is an interval that distinguishes heaven from hell. 
From this it may now be known what the world of spirits is. When evil spirits who are with man are in that world, they are not in any infernal torment, but are in the delights of the love of self 
and of the world, as also of all the pleasures in which the man himself is; for they are in every thought and every affection of the man; but when they are sent back into their hell, they return into 
their former state. </p>

The evil spirits present with a person do indeed belong in the hells, yet when they are present with him they are not in hell but have been summoned from there. The place where they are while present 
with him lies midway between heaven and hell and is called the world of spirits, which has often been mentioned before now. In that world called the world of spirits there are good spirits as well, and 
these too are present with a person. Into that world people also come immediately after death, and having stayed there for a while they are then either banished to the lower earth, or sent down to 
hell, or raised up to heaven, the life that people have led being the determining factor in every case. That world serves as the upper boundary of the hells, which are closed or opened there at the Lord's 
good pleasure; and that world also serves as the lower boundary of heaven. It is therefore an intervening region that marks off heaven from hell. From all this one can see what the world of spirits 
is. While the evil spirits present with a person are in that world they are not subject to any hellish torment but enjoy the delights typical of self-love and love of the world, as well as the delights 
gained from all the pleasures for which the person himself has a liking; for they are present in the whole of the person's thought and the whole of his affection. But when they are sent back to their 
own hell they return to the state that was theirs previously. </p>

</p><b>5852.</b>
Spiritus mali qui apud hominem, quidem ab infernis sunt, sed tunc quando apud illum, non in inferno sunt, verum inde desumpti: locus ubi tunc sunt, est medius inter infernum et caelum et vocatur Mundus 
spirituum, cujus mentio prius saepe facta est; in mundo illo qui mundus spirituum vocatur, sunt etiam boni spiritus, qui etiam apud hominem sunt; in illum mundum etiam veniunt homines statim post 
mortem, et post (x)aliquam moram ibi vel ablegantur in terram inferiorem, vel demittuntur in infernum, vel elevantur in caelum, quilibet secundum vitam suam; (m)in mundo illo a superiore terminantur inferna, 
quae clauduntur ibi et aperiuntur ad beneplacitum Domini; et in mundo illo ab inferiore terminatur caelum, est itaque interstitiale distinguens caelum ab inferno;(n) ex his sciri potest quid Mundus 
spirituum. Cum mali spiritus qui apud hominem, in illo mundo sunt, non sunt in aliquo cruciatu infernali sed sunt in jucundis amoris sui et mundi, tum voluptatum omnium in quibus ipse homo, nam 
sunt in omni cogitatione et in omni affectione hominis; at cum remittuntur in infernum suum, in priorem {1} statum redeunt. @1 i suum$ </p>
