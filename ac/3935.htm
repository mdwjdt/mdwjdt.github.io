<h4 align="center"></h4><p><strong>3935.</strong>“于是给他起名叫迦得”表它的根本性质。这从“名”和“起名”的含义清楚可知，“名”和“起名”是指根本性质，如前所述。“迦得”表示具体性质；即信之良善的性质和行为的性质。凡在里面的事物都表示根本性质；此处是指凡在信之良善里面和行为里面的事物；并且这些事物是不计其数的，因为这性质因人而异。而且，在那些未处于信之良善，因而未处于善行之人里面，这性质是相反的；这种相反的性质也由“迦得”来表示，这时就以反面意义来提及他。当内在人的信之良善和外在人的善行相对应时，如前所示，它们就构成第三个一般方法，也就是在人能进入主的国度之前，也就是在他能通过重生变成教会之前，这第三个一般方法要在信仰和行为上被承认。</p>

And she called his name Gad. That this signifies its quality, is evident from the signification of a "name" and of "calling a name," as being quality (concerning which above). The quality itself is signified 
by "Gad;" namely, the quality of the good of faith and of works. By "quality" is signified everything whatever that is within; here, within the good of faith and within works; and these are things 
innumerable, for the quality varies in each individual, and is also the contrary in those who are not in the good of faith, and thus not in good works; which quality is also signified by "Gad," 
when he is named in the opposite sense. When the good of faith of the internal man, and the good works of the external man, correspond, they, as shown above, are a third general means, which is to be 
acknowledged in faith and in act before a man can enter into the Lord's kingdom; that is, before he can by regeneration be made a church. </p>

<p align="center"><b>Elliott(1983-1999) 3935</b></p><p><b>3935.</b>
'And she called his name Gad' means the essential nature of it. This is clear from the meaning of 'name' and 'calling the name' as the essential nature, dealt with above. The particular nature is meant 
by 'Gad', namely the nature of the good of faith and the nature of works. By the essential nature is meant everything within, in this case within the good of faith and within works; and all things 
present within this are countless, for that nature varies from one person to the next. And in addition to this, a contrary nature exists with those in whom the good of faith is not present, and so by 
whom no good works are done. This nature also is meant by Gad when he is referred to in the contrary sense. When the good of faith which belongs to the internal man, and good works which belong to the 
external man, correspond they constitute a third general means, as stated above, which has to be acknowledged in faith and in action before the person can enter the Lord's kingdom, that is, by means 
of regeneration become the Church. </p>

</p><b>3935.</b>
`Et vocavit nomen ejus Gad': quod significet quale ejus, constat a significatione `nominis' et `vocare nomen' quod sit quale, de qua supra; ipsum quale significatur per `ad,' nempe quale boni fidei 
et quale operum; per quale significatur omne id quod usquam inest, hic bono fidei et operibus, et sunt innumerabilia, nam apud unumquemvis est quale varium; et est quoque contrarium apud illos qui 
non in bono fidei sunt, ita non in bonis operibus; </p>
<p>hoc quale etiam significatur per Gad, cum is in opposito sensu nominatur.  Bonum fidei quod est interni hominis, et bona opera quae sunt externi 
hominis, {1}quae correspondent, ut supra ostensum, est tertium medium commune, quod agnoscendum fide et actu antequam homo intrare potest in regnum Domini, hoc est, per regenerationem fieri Ecclesia. @1 
et correspondent bono fidei$ </p>
