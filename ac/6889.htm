Verses 16-20. Go and gather the elders of Israel together, and say unto them, Jehovah the God of your fathers hath been seen of me, the God of Abraham, of Isaac, and of Jacob, saying, Visiting I have 
visited you, and that which is done to you in Egypt; and I say, I will make you come up out of the affliction of Egypt unto the land of the Canaanite, and the Hittite, and the Amorite, and the Perizzite, 
and the Hivite, and the Jebusite, unto a land flowing with milk and honey. And they shall hear thy voice, and thou shalt go in, thou and the elders of Israel, unto the king of Egypt, and ye shall 
say unto him, Jehovah God of the Hebrews hath met with us; and now let us go we pray a way of three days into the wilderness, that we may sacrifice to Jehovah our God. And I know that the king of Egypt 
will not allow you to go, and not by a strong hand. And I will put forth My hand, and smite Egypt with all My wonders which I will do in the midst thereof and afterward he will send you away. "Go and

of Egypt," signifies a raising and liberation from false memory-knowledges; "unto the land of the Canaanite, and the Hittite, and the Amorite, and the Perizzite, and the Hivite, and the Jebusite," signifies

signifies obedience; "and thou shalt go in, thou and the elders of Israel, unto the king of Egypt," signifies communication with those who are in falsities and who have infested; "and ye shall say unto

signifies foresight; "that the king of Egypt will not allow you to go," signifies that falsity would oppose itself; "and not by a strong hand," signifies that the power of those who are of the spiritual 
church will not prevail against them; "and I will put forth My hand," signifies power from the Divine; "and smite Egypt with all My wonders," signifies the means of Divine power against falsities; 
"which I will do in the midst thereof," signifies which shall touch them directly; "and afterward he will send you away," signifies their being driven away, and liberation. </p>

worship of the Lord. 'And I know' means foresight. 'That the king of Egypt will not allow you to go' means that falsity will set itself in opposition. 'Not even by a strong hand' means that against

Vers. 16-20.  Ito et congreges seniores Israelis, et dicas ad illos, Jehovah Deus patrum vestrorum visus est ad me, Deus Abrahami, Jischaki, et Jacobi, dicendo, Visitando visitavi vos, et quod factum 
vobis in Aegypto.  Et dico, Ascendere faciam vos ex afflictione Aegypti, ad terram Cananaei et Chittaei, et Emorraei et Perisaei, et Chivaei et Jebusaei, ad terram fluentem lacte et melle.  Et audiverint 
vocem tuam, et intres tu et seniores Israelis ad regem Aegypti, et dicatis ad illum, Jehovah Deus Hebraeorum occurrit nobis, et nunc eamus quaeso viam trium dierum in desertum, et sacrificemus Jehovae 
Deo nostro.  Et Ego novi quod non dabit vobis rex Aegypti ad eundum, et non manu forti.  Et mittam manum Meam, et percutiam Aegyptum omnibus mirabilibus Meis, quae faciam in medio illius; et postea 
mittet vos. `Ito et congreges seniores Israelis' significat intelligentes in Ecclesia spirituali: `et dicas ad illos' significat instructionem: `Jehovah Deus patrum vestrorum' significat Divinum 
Antiquae Ecclesiae: `visus est ad me' significat praesentiam Ipsius: `Deus Abrahami, Jischaki, et Jacobi' significat Ipsum Divinum et Divinum Humanum Domini: `dicendo, Visitando visitavi vos' significat 
adventum Ipsius ad illos qui ab Ecclesia: `et quod factum vobis in Aegypto' significat subjugationis conatum: `et dico, Ascendere faciam vos ex afflictione Aegypti' significat elevationem et liberationem 
ab infestatione a scientificis falsis: `ad terram Cananaei et Chittaei, et Emorraei et Perisaei, et Chivaei et Jebusaei' significat regionem caeli occupatam ab illis qui in malis et falsis: `ad 
terram fluentem lacte et melle' significat ubi amoenum et jucundum: `et audiverint vocem tuam' significat oboedientiam: `et intres tu et seniores Israelis ad regem Aegypti' significat communicationem 
cum illis qui in falsis et infestarunt: `et dicatis ad illum' significat influxum: `Jehovah Deus Hebraeorum occurrit nobis' significat Divinum Domini in Ecclesia, et Ipsius mandatum: `et nunc eamus quaeso 
viam trium dierum in desertum' significat vitam veri in statu prorsus remoto a falsis, tametsi in obscuro: `et sacrificemus Jehovae Deo nostro' significat ita cultum Domini: `et Ego novi' significat 
praevidentiam: `quod non dabit vobis rex Aegypti ad eundum' significat quod falsum se oppositurum: `et non manu forti' significat quod contra illos non praevalebit potentia eorum qui ab Ecclesia 
spirituali: `et mittam manum Meam' significat potentiam ex Divino: `et percutiam Aegyptum omnibus mirabilibus Meis' significat potentiae Divinae media contra falsa: `quae faciam in medio illius' significat 
quae illos directe tangent: et postea mittet vos' significat abactionem illorum et liberationem. </p>
