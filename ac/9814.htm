<h3 align="center" class="ired">属天的奥秘 第9814节</h3>
<h4 align="center"></h4><p><strong>9814.</strong>“你要给你哥哥亚伦作圣衣”表毗邻属天国度的属灵国度的一个代表。这从“衣”的含义清楚可知，“衣”是指总体上的真理，事实上是指给良善作衣的真理（参看<a href="5954.htm">5954</a>，<a href="9212.htm">9212</a>，<a href="9216.htm">9216</a>节）。“衣服”表示真理来源于天堂，在那里，天使都穿着与他们从良善所拥有的真理相一致的衣服（<a href="165.htm">165</a>，<a href="5248.htm">5248</a>，<a href="5954.htm">5954</a>，<a href="9212.htm">9212</a>节）；由此可见，亚伦的衣服代表毗邻属天国度的主的属灵国度。因为亚伦代表神性属天层方面的主（<a href="9810.htm">9810</a>节）；因此，他所穿的衣服代表如同贴身的衣服那样毗邻属天国度的神性属灵层。神性属灵层就是从主的神性良善发出的神性真理；这真理在天堂显为光，事实上就是既光照天使的外在视觉，也光照他们的内在视觉的光。这光照着接受对象，就是天使而变化；这种变化会产生各种不同的可见现象，如云、彩虹、各种色彩和亮度；它们还在天使周围产生闪亮的衣服。由此可见，亚伦的圣衣代表主的属灵国度。因为众天堂被分成两个国度，即属天国度和属灵国度（对此，参看<a href="9277.htm">9277</a>节）。属天国度里的人看似赤身，而属灵国度里的人则看似穿着衣服。由此再次明显可知，显为光的神性真理或神性属灵层就是那用来作衣服的。<br />但谁能相信，在拥有圣言，以及随之关于神性和天上事物的启示的教会中，如此大的无知竟在那里掌权，以至于没有人知道天使和灵人呈现人的形式，看上去就是人，能彼此看见、听见、交谈？更没有人知道他们穿着衣服。他们的确是这样，这一事实在那些如此沉浸于外在事物，以至于认为唯独肉体活着，凡不能用肉眼看见、用肉手摸到的，就不存在的人那里，不仅会遭到质疑，还会遭到完全的否认（<a href="1881.htm">1881</a>节）。而事实上，天堂满是人，他们都是天使，并且穿着各种闪亮辉煌的衣服。但世人用肉眼根本无法看见这些事物，只能在主打开灵眼时用灵眼看到。古人，如亚伯拉罕、撒拉、罗得、雅各、约书亚、基甸，以及众先知所看到的天使不是用肉眼，而是用那时打开的灵眼看到的。这些天使也穿着衣服，这一点从坐在主坟墓旁的天使明显看出来，抹大拉的马利亚和雅各的母亲马利亚看见他穿着闪亮的白衣（马太福音<a href="http://39-27.cn/太28.3.htm">28:3</a>；马可福音<a href="http://39-27.cn/可16.5.htm">16:5</a>；路加福音<a href="http://39-27.cn/路24.4.htm">24:4</a>）；这一点尤其从在其荣耀中被彼得、雅各和约翰看到的主自己明显看出来，当时祂的衣裳洁白闪耀，就像光一样（马太福音<a href="http://39-27.cn/太17.2.htm">17:2</a>；路加福音<a href="http://39-27.cn/路9.29.htm">9:29</a>）；这衣裳也代表神性属灵层，或从祂发出的神性真理。<br />由此可见启示录中的“白衣”表示什么：<br />然而在撒狄，你还有几个名字是未曾污秽自己衣服的；他们要穿白衣与我同行，因为他们是配得过的。凡得胜的，必这样穿白衣。（启示录<a href="http://39-27.cn/启3.4.htm">3:4</a>，<a href="http://39-27.cn/启3.5.htm">5</a>）<br />此处“衣服”是指属灵真理，就是源于良善的真理，如前所示；“白”是指纯正的真理（<a href="3301.htm">3301</a>，<a href="4007.htm">4007</a>，<a href="5319.htm">5319</a>节）。以下出现在启示录的另一处的话同样清楚：<br />我看见天开了，见有一匹白马，骑在马上的称为忠信真实，祂审判、争战都按着公义。在天上的众军穿着细麻衣，又白又洁，跟随祂。（启示录<a href="http://39-27.cn/启19.11.htm">19:11</a>，<a href="http://39-27.cn/启19.14.htm">14</a>）<br /><br />我看见二十四位长老坐在宝座上，身穿白衣。（启示录<a href="http://39-27.cn/启4.4.htm">4:4</a>）</p>

<p align="center"><b>Potts(1905-1910) 9814</b></p><p><b>9814.</b>
And thou shalt make garments of holiness for Aaron thy brother. That this signifies a representative of the spiritual kingdom joined to the celestial kingdom, is evident from the signification of "garments," 
as being truths in general, and indeed truths which clothe good (see n. 5954, 9212, 9216). That "garments" denote truths, originates in heaven, where angels appear clothed in garments in accordance 
with their truths from good (n. 165, 5248, 5954, 9212); from which it can be seen that by the garments of Aaron was represented the spiritual kingdom of the Lord joined to His celestial kingdom. 
For Aaron represented the Lord as to the Divine celestial (n. 9810); whence the garments joined to him represented the Divine spiritual joined to the celestial kingdom, as a garment is to the body. 
The Divine spiritual is the Divine truth that proceeds from the Lord's Divine good; this appears in heaven as light, and moreover, is the light which illumines the external as well as the internal sight 
of the angels. The modification of this light according to the recipient subjects, which are angels, presents to the sight various phenomena, such as clouds, rainbows, colors, and splendors, of various 
kinds; and it also presents shining garments about the angels. From this it can be seen that the spiritual kingdom of the Lord was represented by Aaron's garments of holiness. For there are two kingdoms 
into which the heavens have been divided, the celestial kingdom and the spiritual kingdom (on which see n. 9277); they who are in the celestial kingdom appear naked, but they who are in the spiritual 
kingdom appear clothed. From this it is again evident that it is Divine truth, or the Divine spiritual, and which appears as light, that invests or clothes. [2] But who could possibly believe 
that within the church, where there is the Word, and the consequent enlightenment about Divine and heavenly things, ignorance so great should reign that it is not known that angels and spirits are in 
the human form, and appear to themselves as men; and also that they see and hear each other, and converse together; and that it is known still less that they appear clothed in garments. That this is 
the case falls not only into doubt, but also into total denial, with those who are so much immersed in outward things as to believe that the body alone lives, and that all is nothing which they do not 
see with the bodily eyes, and touch with the bodily hands (n. 1881); when yet the heavens are full of men, who are angels, and who are clothed in garments of varied resplendence. But nothing of these 
things can be seen by a man on earth through the eyes of his body; but through the eyes of his spirit, when these are opened by the Lord. The angels who were seen by the ancients, as by Abraham, Sarah, 
Lot, Jacob, Joshua, Gideon, and also the prophets, were not seen with the eyes of the body, but with the eyes of the spirit, which were then opened. That these angels appeared clothed in garments, 
is evident from the angels who sat at the Lord's sepulcher, and were seen in shining white garments by Mary Magdalene and Mary the mother of James (Matt. 28:3; Mark 16:5; Luke 24:4); and especially is 
the same thing evident from the Lord Himself when seen in His glory by Peter, James, and John, in that His raiment was then white and glistering, and was like the light (Matt. 17:2; Luke 9:29); by which 
raiment there was also represented the Divine spiritual, that is, the Divine truth which is from Him.  [3] From this it can be seen what is signified by "white garments" in Revelation: </p>
<p>     Thou 
hast a few names in Sardis which have not defiled their garments, and they shall walk with Me in white, for they are worthy. He that overcometh, the same shall be clothed in white garments (Rev. 3:4, 
5); </p>
<p>here "garments" denote spiritual truths, which are truths from good (as was shown above); and "white" denotes genuine truth (n. 3301, 4007, 5319). In like manner elsewhere: </p>
<p>     I saw heaven open, 
and behold a white horse, and He that sat upon him was called Faithful and True; and in righteousness He doth judge and fight. His armies in heaven followed Him clothed in fine linen, white and clean 
(Rev. 19:11, 14).      Upon the thrones I saw four and twenty elders, clothed in white garments (Rev. 4:4). </p>

'And you shall make holy garments for Aaron your brother' means a representative sign of the spiritual kingdom lying adjacent to the celestial kingdom. This is clear from the meaning of 'garments' in 
general as truths, and more particularly as truths clothing good, dealt with in <a href="5954.htm">5954</a>, <a href="9212.htm">9212</a>, <a href="9216.htm">9216</a>. The meaning of 'garments' as truths owes its origin to things in heaven, where angels appear dressed 
in clothes in keeping with the truths they have that spring from good, <a href="165.htm">165</a>, <a href="5248.htm">5248</a>, <a href="5954.htm">5954</a>, <a href="9212.htm">9212</a>; and from this it may be recognized that Aaron's garments represented the Lord's spiritual kingdom lying adjacent 
to His celestial kingdom. For Aaron represented the Lord in respect of the Divine Celestial, <a href="9810.htm">9810</a>, and therefore the garments he wore represented the Divine Spiritual adjacent to the celestial 
kingdom like clothing next to the body, the Divine Spiritual being Divine Truth emanating from the Lord's Divine Good. It presents itself in heaven as light, indeed it is the light which illuminates both 
the outward and the inward powers of sight that angels possess. Modifications of this light - which are determined by the subjects, that is, the angels, that receive it - produce different visible 
phenomena, such as clouds, rainbows, and various colours and brightnesses; they also produce shining garments about the angels. From all this it may be recognized that the Lord's spiritual kingdom was 
represented by Aaron's holy garments. For there are two kingdoms into which the heavens are divided, the celestial kingdom and the spiritual kingdom, regarding which, see <a href="9277.htm">9277</a>. Those in the celestial 
kingdom appear naked, but those in the spiritual kingdom appear in clothing. From this it is again clear that Divine Truth, or the Divine Spiritual, which appears as light, is that which serves to clothe.

 But who would ever credit it that, even though the Word exists within the Church and consequently enlightenment regarding Divine and heavenly realities, ignorance reigns there, so great 
that no one knows that angels and spirits take on the human form, appear to themselves as human beings, and see, hear, and talk to one another? Still less does anyone know that they appear clothed in 
garments. The idea that they do so is met not merely with doubt but also with complete denial on the part of those so blind to everything other than external things, that they think that the body alone 
lives, and that what they cannot see with the eyes in their body or touch with the hands on their body has no existence whatever, see <a href="1881.htm">1881</a>. But in actual fact the heavens are full of human beings, 
who are angels, and these are clothed with garments shining in varied degrees of brightness. But these beings cannot at all be seen by a person on earth through the eyes of his body, only through the 
eyes of his spirit, when the Lord opens them. The angels who were seen by the ancients, such as Abraham, Sarah, Lot, Jacob, Joshua, Gideon, and also the Prophets, were not seen by those persons' bodily 
eyes but by those of their spirit which had been opened then. The fact that they would also have appeared clothed in robes is clear from the angels sitting at the Lord's tomb, whom Mary Magdalene and 
Mary the mother of James saw, and who were wearing shining white garments, <a href="http://bible.gospelcom.net/cgi-bin/bible?passage=Matt%2028:3&amp;version=ESV&amp;interface=print&amp;showfn=yes&amp;showxref">Matt 28:3</a>; <a href="http://bible.gospelcom.net/cgi-bin/bible?passage=Mark%2016:5&amp;version=ESV&amp;interface=print&amp;showfn=yes&amp;showxref">Mark 16:5</a>; <a href="http://bible.gospelcom.net/cgi-bin/bible?passage=Luke%2024:4&amp;version=ESV&amp;interface=print&amp;showfn=yes&amp;showxref">Luke 24:4</a>, and in particular from the Lord Himself when seen in His glory by Peter, James, and John, 
in that His clothing was dazzling white and like the light, <a href="http://bible.gospelcom.net/cgi-bin/bible?passage=Matt%2017:2&amp;version=ESV&amp;interface=print&amp;showfn=yes&amp;showxref">Matt 17:2</a>; <a href="http://bible.gospelcom.net/cgi-bin/bible?passage=Luke%209:29&amp;version=ESV&amp;interface=print&amp;showfn=yes&amp;showxref">Luke 9:29</a>. This clothing too represented the Divine Spiritual, or the Divine Truth that emanated from Him.  </p>

<p><b>[3]</b>
 All this makes 
clear what 'white garments' means in the Book of Revelation,  </p>
<blockquote>
You have a few names also in Sardis, who have not soiled their garments, and they will walk with Me in white ones, for they are worthy. 
He who conquers will be clad in white garments. <a href="http://bible.gospelcom.net/cgi-bin/bible?passage=Rev%203:4,%205&amp;version=ESV&amp;interface=print&amp;showfn=yes&amp;showxref">Rev 3:4, 5</a>.  
</blockquote>
<p>'Garments' here are spiritual truths, which are truths springing from good, as shown above; and 'white' is authentic truth, <a href="3301.htm">3301</a>, <a href="4007.htm">4007</a>, <a href="5319.htm">5319</a>. The following words that occur elsewhere in the same book are similarly made clear,  </p>
<blockquote>
I saw heaven opened, and behold, a white horse; and He who sat on it was called faithful and true, and 
in righteousness He judges and goes into battle. His armies in heaven were following Him, clothed in linen white and clean. <a href="http://bible.gospelcom.net/cgi-bin/bible?passage=Rev%2019:11,%2014&amp;version=ESV&amp;interface=print&amp;showfn=yes&amp;showxref">Rev 19:11, 14</a>.  
</blockquote>
<p>And elsewhere again in that book,  </p>
<blockquote>
On the thrones I 
saw twenty-four elders, clad in white garments. <a href="http://bible.gospelcom.net/cgi-bin/bible?passage=Rev%204:4&amp;version=ESV&amp;interface=print&amp;showfn=yes&amp;showxref">Rev 4:4</a>.

`Et facies vestes sanctitatis (x)Aharoni fratri tuo': quod significet repraesentativum regni spiritualis adjuncti regno caelesti, constat ex significatione `vestium' quod in genere sint vera, et quidem 
vera investientia bonum, de qua n. 5954, 9212, 9216. Quod `vestes' sint vera, ducit causam e caelo, ubi angeli apparent vestibus induti secundum vera ex bono, n. 165, 5248, 5954, 9212; unde constare

per vestes sanctitatis Aharonis. Sunt enim duo regna in quae caeli divisi sunt, regnum caeleste et regnum spirituale, de quibus videatur n. 9277; qui in regno caelesti sunt, illi apparent nudi, qui autem 
in regno spirituali, apparent amicti; inde iterum constat quod Divinum Verum, seu Divinum Spirituale, quod ut lux apparet, sit quod investit. 	Sed quis usquam credere potest quod intra Ecclesiam, 
ubi tamen 2 Verbum est, et inde illustratio de Divinis et caelestibus, tanta ignorantia regnet ut non sciatur quod angeli et spiritus sint in forma humana, ac appareant sibi ut homines, et quoque quod 
se invicem videant, audiant, interque se colloquantur? utque adhuc minus sciatur quod appareant vestibus induti; quod ita sit, non modo cadit in dubitationem, sed etiam prorsus in negationem apud illos 
qui tantum in externis sunt ut credant modo corpus vivere, {5}et id nihil esse quod non corporeis oculis vident, et corporeis manibus tangunt, videatur n. 1881; cum tamen caeli pleni sunt hominibus, 
qui angeli, et illi vestibus varie splendentibus induti; sed hi videri prorsus (x)nequeunt ab homine in terris per oculos ejus corporis, sed per oculos ejus spiritus, quando illi a Domino aperiuntur; 
angeli qui antiquis visi sunt, sicut Abrahamo, Sarae, Lotho, Jacobo, Joschuae, Guideoni, tum Prophetis, nec visi sunt oculis corporis sed oculis spiritus eorum, qui tunc aperti; quod etiam vestimentis 
induti apparuerint, constat ab angelis sedentibus ad sepulcrum Domini visis Mariae Magdalenae et Mariae Jacobi, in vestibus albis splendentibus, Matth. xxviii 3; Marc. xvi 5; Luc. xxiv 4; imprimis
