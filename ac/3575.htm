<h3 align="center" class="ired">属天的奥秘 第3575节</h3>
<h4 align="center"></h4><p><strong>3575.</strong>“他父亲一闻他的衣服上的香气”表他所感知到的良善真理散发的令人愉悦之物。这从“香气”、“闻”和“衣服”的含义清楚可知：“香气”是指令人愉悦之物（<a href="925.htm">925</a>节）；“闻”是指感知那愉悦之物；“衣服”是指真理（<a href="297.htm">297</a>，<a href="1073.htm">1073</a>，<a href="2576.htm">2576</a>节）。由于衣服是以扫的，以扫是此处“他的”所指的，并且“以扫”代表属世层的良善，故所表示的是良善的真理。良善的真理就是那通过理性层的直接和间接流注而在属世层中所产生的（参看<a href="3573.htm">3573</a>节）。这就是那被渴望或追求的真理。但由于若不同时通过间接流注，也就是经由理性层的真理的流注，它无法通过来自理性层的良善的直接流注被产生，并且若不通过大量居间事物（这些事物就是此处以扫和雅各在内义上所表示的），这一切是不可能的，故“闻他的衣服上的香气”就表示所感知到的良善的真理。</p>

And he smelled the smell of his garments. That this signifies that which was grateful from the truth of good which he perceived, is evident from the signification of the "smell," as being that which 
is grateful (n. 925), and of "smelling," as being to perceive that which is grateful; and from the signification of "garments," as being truth (n. 297, 1073, 2576); and because they were Esau's, who is 
here meant by "his," and by Esau is represented the good of the natural, therefore it is the truth of good which is signified. The truth of good is that which is produced in the natural by means of 
the immediate and mediate influx of the rational (see above n. 3573); this truth was that which was desired; but because it could not be produced by immediate influx from the good of the rational, unless 
at the same time by mediate influx (that is, through the truth of the rational), and as this could not be produced except by means of a number of means, which are what are here described by "Esau" 
and "Jacob" in the internal sense, therefore by "smelling the smell of his garments" is signified the truth of good which was perceived. </p>

<p align="center"><b>Elliott(1983-1999) 3575</b></p><p><b>3575.</b>
'And he smelled the odour of his clothes' means the pleasing emanation from the truth of good which he perceived. This is clear from the meaning of 'odour' as that which is pleasing, dealt with in <a href="925.htm">925</a>, 
and of 'smelling' as perceiving that which is pleasant, and from the meaning of 'clothes' as truth, dealt with in <a href="297.htm">297</a>, <a href="1073.htm">1073</a>, <a href="2576.htm">2576</a>. Because the clothes were Esau's, to whom 'his' refers here, and 'Esau' 
represents the good of the natural, it is the truth of good that is meant. The truth of good is that which is produced in the natural through the direct and indirect influx of the rational, dealt 
with above in <a href="3573.htm">3573</a>. This was the truth that was being sought. But because it could not be produced by means of direct influx from the good of the rational without indirect influx simultaneously, that 
is, influx through the truth of the rational, and this was not possible except through the many intermediate things which Esau and Jacob are used to describe here in the internal sense, 'smelling the 
odour of his clothes' therefore means the truth of good which was perceived. </p>

</p><b>3575.</b>
`Et odoratus est odorem vestium illius': quod significet gratum ex boni vero quod percepit, constat ex significatione `odoris' quod sit gratum, de qua n. 925, et `odorari' quod sit percipere quod gratum; 
et ex significatione `vestium' quod sit verum, de qua n. 297, 1073, 2576; quae quia erant Esavi, qui hic est `illius,' et per `Esavum' repraesentatur bonum naturalis, est boni verum quod significatur. 
 Boni verum est illud quod per influxum rationalis immediatum et mediatum, de quo {1}supra n. (x)3573, in naturali producitur; hoc verum erat quod desiderabatur; sed quia illud per immediatum influxum 
a rationalis bono produci non posset, nisi simul per mediatum, hoc est, per rationalis verum, et hoc non nisi per plura media, quae sunt illa quae per `Esavum et Jacobum' in sensu interno hic 
describuntur, ideo per `odorari odorem vestium illius' significatur boni verum, quod percipiebatur'. @1 i mox$  </p>
