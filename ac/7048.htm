<h3 align="center" class="ired">属天的奥秘 第7048节</h3>
<h4 align="center"></h4><p><strong>7048.</strong>“这样耶和华才放了他”表他们被允许成为代表。这从“放了他”的含义清楚可知，“放了他”，即不杀他，是指他们被允许成为代表。因为“耶和华想要杀他”表示无法在这个民族中间建立一个代表性教会（参看<a href="7043.htm">7043</a>节）；因此，当经上在此说“祂放了他”时，意思是说他们被允许成为代表，也就是说，一个教会代表，而非实际的教会被允许在这个民族中间建立。代表一个教会是一回事，成为一个实际的教会是另外一回事，这一点从以下事实明显看出来：就连恶人也能代表一个教会，但只有善人才能成为一个教会；因为代表一个教会这完全是外在的事（<a href="3670.htm">3670</a>，<a href="4208.htm">4208</a>，<a href="4281.htm">4281</a>节）。</p>

And He ceased from him. That this signifies that it was permitted that they should represent, is evident from the signification of "ceasing from him," namely, from killing him, as being permission that 
they should represent; for that "Jehovah sought to kill him," signified that a representative church could not be instituted with that nation (see n. 7043); and therefore when it is now said that "He 
ceased from him," it signifies that it was permitted that they should represent, that is, that there should be instituted with that nation the representative of a church, but not a church. That it 
is one thing to represent a church, and another to be a church, is evident from the fact that even the evil can represent a church, but none except the good can be a church; for to represent a church 
is merely external (n. 3670, 4208, 4281). </p>

'And He ceased from him' means that they were allowed to be representative. This is clear from the meaning of 'ceasing from him', that is to say, from killing him, as their being allowed to be representative. 
For the statement that Jehovah sought to kill him meant that a representative Church could not be established among that nation, <a href="7043.htm">7043</a>, and therefore when it says here that 'He ceased from him' 
the meaning is that they were allowed to be representative, that is, a representative of the Church, but no actual Church was allowed to be established among that nation. It is one thing to represent 
a Church, and another to be an actual Church, as is evident from the fact that even those who are wicked can represent a Church, but only the good can actually be a Church; for representing a Church 
is something entirely external, see <a href="3670.htm">3670</a>, <a href="4208.htm">4208</a>, <a href="4281.htm">4281</a>. </p>

`Et cessavit ab illo':  quod significet quod permissum ut repraesentarent, constat (c)a significatione `cessare ab illo,' nempe occidendo, quod sit permissum ut repraesentarent; nam quod `Jehovah quaesiverit 
occidere illum' significabat quod apud illam gentem Ecclesia repraesentativa institui non posset, n. 7043, quare nunc {1} cum dicitur quod `cessaverit ab illo,' significatur quod permissum ut 
repraesentarent, hoc est, ut apud illam gentem institueretur repraesentativum Ecclesiae, non autem Ecclesia; quod aliud sit repraesentare Ecclesiam, et aliud esse Ecclesia, patet ex eo quod Ecclesiam 
repraesentare possint {2}etiam mali, sed esse Ecclesia non nisi quam boni, nam repraesentare Ecclesiam est modo externum, videatur n. 3670, 4208, 4281. 	@1 i autem$ 	@2 quoque$ </p>
