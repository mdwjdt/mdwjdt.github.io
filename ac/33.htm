<h3 align="center" class="ired">属天的奥秘 第33节</h3>
<h4 align="center"></h4><p><strong>33.</strong>众所周知，若没有爱，就不可能有生命，也不可能有快乐。爱如何，生命及快乐也如何。除去爱或渴望（渴望生于爱），思想必立时停顿，人将如死人一般。这是我通过亲身经历所了解的事实。我欲和物欲产生生命及快乐的假象，但是，由于它们与真实的爱——爱主至上和爱邻如己，完全对立，故它不是爱，而是恨，因为人的我欲和物欲越重，他对邻舍和主的仇恨就越深。<br />真实的爱是爱主，真实的生命是源于主的爱的生命，真实的快乐是爱的生命所产生的快乐。真实的爱只可能有一个，故真实的生命只可能有一个。它产生真实的喜悦和快乐，正如天堂的天使所享受的。</p>

<p><strong>[NCE]33.</strong> Anyone can see perfectly well that no hint of life ever exists without some kind of love and that no trace of joy ever exists unless it results from love. The nature of the love determines the nature of the life and of the joy.<br />If you were to take the things you love — the things you long for (since longings are bound up with love) — and set them aside, your thought processes would come to an immediate halt and you would be like a corpse. I have learned this through experience.<br />Self-love and materialism produce an imitation of life and an imitation of joy, but since they are diametrically opposed to genuine love — that is, loving the Lord above all and loving our neighbor as ourselves — it stands to reason that they are not forms of love but of hatred. Notice that the more we love ourselves and worldly goods, the more we hate our neighbor and therefore the Lord.<br />Genuine love, then, is love for the Lord, and genuine life is a life of love received from him. True joy is the joy of that life.<br />Only one genuine love can exist, so only one genuine life can exist, and it gives rise to true joy and happiness, like that felt by angels in heaven. </p>
<p align="center"><b>Potts(1905-1910) 33</b></p><p><b>33.</b>
It is in everyone's power very well to know that no life is possible without some love, and that no joy is possible except that which flows from love. Such however as is the love, such is the life, and 
such the joy: if you were to remove loves, or what is the same thing, desires-for these are of love-thought would instantly cease, and you would become like a dead person, as has been shown me to the 
life. The loves of self and of the world have in them some resemblance to life and to joy, but as they are altogether contrary to true love, which consists in a man's loving the Lord above all things, 
and his neighbor as himself, it must be evident that they are not loves, but hatreds, for in proportion as anyone loves himself and the world, in the same proportion he hates his neighbor, and thereby 
the Lord. Wherefore true love is love to the Lord, and true life is the life of love from Him, and true joy is the joy of that life. There can be but one true love, and therefore but one true life, 
whence flow true joys and true felicities, such as are those of the angels in the heavens. </p>

<p align="center"><b>Elliott(1983-1999) 33</b></p><p><b>33.</b>
Everyone is capable of knowing very well that no life is possible without love of some kind, nor any type of joy whatsoever except the joy that flows out from the love. Furthermore the nature of the 
love determines the nature of the life and of the joy. If you took away your loves, and what amounts to the same, your desires (since these stem from love), thought would instantly perish and you would 
be as one dead. This I have been shown convincingly. Self-love and the love of the world present a semblance of life and of joy, but because they are absolutely contrary to true love, which is loving 
the Lord above all things and the neighbour as oneself, it is clear that neither of them is love but hatred. For the more anyone loves himself and the world, the more he hates his neighbour and so the 
Lord. Consequently true love is love to the Lord, true life is the life inherent in love from Him, and true joy is the joy of that life. The existence of more than one true love is not possible. Nor 
consequently is the existence of more than one true life possible which is the source of all true joy and happiness, such as angels in the heavens enjoy.  </p>

</p><b>33.</b>
Notissimum unicuivis esse potest quod nulla usquam vita sit absque aliquo amore, et quod nusquam aliquod gaudium nisi quod profluit ex amore; sed qualis amor, talis vita et tale gaudium: removeres amores, 
seu quod idem est, cupiditates quia eae sunt amoris, cessaret ilico cogitatio et fores instar mortui; quod mihi ostensum est ad vivum. Amores sui et mundi quoddam vitae simile et quoddam gaudii 
simile sistunt, seq quia sunt contrarii prorsus amori vero, qui est ut ament Dominum supra omnia et proximum ut semet, constare potest quod non amores sint sed quod odia; nam quo plus aliquis semet et 
mundum amat, eo plus proximum et sic Dominum odit: quare verus amor est amor in Dominum; et vera vita est vita amoris ab Ipso: et verum gaudium est gaudium illius vitae. Amor verus non dari potest nisi 
unicus, ita nec vera vita nisi unica, unde vera gaudia et verae felicitates quales sunt angelorum in caelis. </p>
