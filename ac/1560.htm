<h3 align="center" class="ired">属天的奥秘 第1560节</h3>
<h4 align="center"></h4><p><strong>1560.</strong>“他起先”表祂在孩提时就拥有的事物。这从前章8节所述清楚可知。此处经上说“起初”（in the beginning），而前节却说“起先”（at the start），是因为（起先）那是在主拥有知识和认知之前。人在接受教导之前的每个状态都是“起先”，开始接受教导之际，则是“起初”。</p><br />

<p><strong>[NCE]1560.</strong> That he had made in the beginning means adopted by him when he was young, as can be seen from the discussion of verse <a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_1560/bible_king-james-version_genesis_13_8" target=_top>8</a> of the previous chapter [搂搂<a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_1560/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_1450" target=_top>1450-1455</a>]. The present verse says "in the beginning" and the last verse said "at the start" because this was before the Lord had been trained in secular and religious knowledge. A start means every phase we pass through before education. Once we commence our education, it is called a beginning. </p>
<p align="center"><b>Potts(1905-1910) 1560</b></p><p><b>1560.</b>
Which he had made in the beginning. That this signifies which He had when a child, is evident from what was said in the preceding chapter at verse 8. It is here said, "in the beginning," and in the preceding 
verse, "at the first," because that was before the Lord had been imbued with knowledges. All the state before a man is instructed, is "the first" [initium]; and when he begins to be instructed, 
it is "the beginning" [principium]. </p>

<p align="center"><b>Elliott(1983-1999) 1560</b></p><p><b>1560.</b>
'That he made in the beginning' means which He had when a boy. This is clear from what has been stated at verse 8 of the previous chapter. The expressions 'in the beginning' here, and 'at the start' 
in the previous verse are used, because it was before the Lord had been endowed with facts and cognitions. Every state that precedes a person's reception of instruction is 'the start' and when he commences 
to receive it, it is 'the beginning'. </p>

<p align="center"><b>Latin(1748-1756) 1560</b>
</p><b>1560.</b>
'Quod fecit in principio': quod significet quae habuit cum puer, constat ex illis quae dicta sunt in cap. praec. ad vers. 8; 'in principio' hic dicitur, et in vers. praec. 'in initio,' quia fuit antequam 
Dominus scientificis et cognitionibus imbutus fuit; status omnis antequam instruitur homo est 'initium,' et cum incipit instrui est 'principium.' </p>
