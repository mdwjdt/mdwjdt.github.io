<h3 align="center" class="ired">属天的奥秘 第1737节</h3>
<h4 align="center"></h4><p><strong>1737.</strong>“把敌人交在你手里”表胜利。这是显而易见的，无需解释。主不断藉着试探的争战和胜利取得并实现人性本质与神性本质的融合，祂凭自己的力量做这一切。人若以其它方式理解联结与融合的方式，就大错特错了。这就是祂成为公义所凭借的方式。融合或结合是通过爱的属天元素，即爱本身实现的，这爱就是耶和华，如前所述。人与主的结合也是通过试探和植入爱的信实现的。若非信被植入在爱中，即若非人通过属于信的事物接受信的生命，即仁爱，结合是不可能的。“追随祂”，即与主结合唯独是指这一点，就象主的人性本质与耶和华融合一样。由于同样的原因，所有这种人都通过主，神唯一的儿子而被称为神的儿子，并因此成为祂的形像。</p>

<p><strong>[NCE]1737.</strong> The fact that who has delivered your enemies into your hand symbolizes victory can be seen without explanation.<br />The Lord achieved and created the union of his human and divine qualities through the constant conflicts and victories of his spiritual trials, and he did so by his own power. Anyone who thinks this union and oneness occurred in any other way is very much mistaken. As a result, the Lord became the embodiment of uprightness. What he eventually united or identified with was heavenly love, that is, love itself, which is Jehovah, as noted above [<a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_1737/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_1735" target=_top>1735</a>].<br />Our own close connection with the Lord also comes about through times of trial, and through the grafting of faith onto love. Unless faith is implanted in love, or in other words, unless the tenets of faith lead us to live a life of faith — which is charity — the bond will never develop. This alone is following him, or forming as close a bond with the Lord as the Lord's human part formed with Jehovah. A life of faith is also what causes all who live it to be called God's children (after the Lord, who is the only child of God) and to become images of him. </p>
<p align="center"><b>Potts(1905-1910) 1737</b></p><p><b>1737.</b>
Who hath delivered thine enemies into thy hand. That this signifies victory, may be seen without explication. The conjunction of the Human Essence with the Divine Essence was procured and effected by 
the Lord by continual combats of temptations and victories, and this from His own power. He who apprehends the mode of the conjunction and union in any other way is much mistaken. By this He became righteousness. 
The conjunction or union was effected with the Celestial of Love, that is, with Love itself, which, as before said, is Jehovah. The conjunction of men with the Lord is also effected by temptations, 
and by the implanting of faith in love. Unless faith is implanted in love, that is, unless a man by the things that are of faith receives the life of faith, that is, charity, there is no conjunction. 
This alone is to follow Him, namely, to be conjoined with the Lord just as the Lord as to His Human Essence was conjoined with Jehovah. Hence also all such are called "sons of God," from the 
Lord who was the only Son of God, and hence they become images of Him. </p>

<p align="center"><b>Elliott(1983-1999) 1737</b></p><p><b>1737.</b>
'Who has delivered your enemies into your hand' means victory. This becomes clear without explanation. The joining of the Human Essence to the Divine Essence was brought about and effected by the Lord 
by means of constant conflicts that constitute temptations, and by victories; and He did all this from His own power. Anyone who conceives the manner of conjunction and union to be different from that 
is much mistaken. This was the way in which He became Righteousness. The conjunction or union was effected with the celestial element of love, that is, with Love itself, which, as has been stated, 
is Jehovah. The joining of men to the Lord is also effected by means of temptations and by the implanting of faith in love. Unless faith is implanted in love, that is, unless a person by means of things 
that belong to faith receives the life of faith, which is charity, conjunction is not possible. This alone is what 'to follow Him' implies, namely to be joined to the Lord, even as the Lord as regards 
His Human Essence was joined to Jehovah. For the same reason all such people are called sons of God - from the Lord who is the only Son of God - and become images of Him. </p>

<p align="center"><b>Latin(1748-1756) 1737</b>
</p><b>1737.</b>
'Qui tradidit hostes tuos in manum tuam': quod significet victoriam, constare potest absque explicatione. Conjunctio Essentiae Humanae cum Divina comparata est et facta a Domino per continuas pugnas 
tentationum et victorias, et hoc ex propria potentia: qui aliter capit conjunctionis et unionis modum, multum fallitur; inde Ipse Justitia factus: conjunctio seu unio facta est cum caelesti amoris, hoc 
est, cum ipso Amore, qui est, ut dictum, Jehovah. Conjunctio hominum cum Domino etiam fit per tentationes, et per implantationem fidei in amorem; nisi implantetur fides in amorem, hoc est, nisi homo 
per illa quae sunt fidei, accipiat fidei vitam, hoc est, charitatem, nusquam conjunctio; hoc solum est sequi Ipsum, nempe ita conjungi Domino, sicut Dominus quoad Humanam Essentiam Jehovae, inde quoque 
omnes illi appellantur filii Dei a Domino Qui unicus Filius Dei, et fiunt imagines Ipsius. </p>
