<h3 align="center" class="ired">属天的奥秘 第10472节</h3>
<h4 align="center"></h4><p><strong>10472</strong>.“你知道这百姓，他们是专于作恶的”表这个民族的兴趣在于与神圣的内在之物分离的外在之物。这从“恶”和“罪”的含义清楚可知，“恶”和“罪”是指与神性的断绝、分离，以及对它的一种背离（参看<a href="4997.htm">4997</a>，<a href="5746.htm">5746</a>，<a href="5841.htm">5841</a>，<a href="9346.htm">9346</a>节）。之所以说“与神圣的内在之物分离”，是因为当外在之物与内在之物分离时，它也与神圣之物分离；因为一个人里面的神圣之物居于他的内在。从天堂流入并与人同住，也就是经由 天堂来自主之物就被称为“神圣”。天堂流入一个人的内在，并经由这内在流入他的外在；因为人的内在是照着天堂的形像，因而是为了接受属于那里的属灵事物而被造的；外在是照着世界的形像，因而是为了接受属于那里的属世事物而被造的（<a href="9279.htm">9279</a>，<a href="10156.htm">10156</a>节）。由此明显可知一个外在与内在分离的人是什么样，也就是说，他的兴趣只在于尘世、世俗和肉体事物。那些兴趣只在于这些事物的人不明白何为内在，因而也不明白何为关心天上的神性事物。他们以为，当他们去做那些构成教会的外在敬拜的事时，也就参与了神性的事。然而事实并非如此；因为在这种时候，要么他们从小就已习惯的肉体快乐主宰了他们的心智，要么他们可以在他人面前表现的世俗目的激励着他们，要么履行他们的职责所获得的利益或赢得的声望成为他们的动机。因此，他们对尘世、世俗和肉体事物感兴趣，对天上的神性事物不感兴趣。而那些兴趣在于来自内在之物的外在事物之人则不然。</p>

Thou knowest the people, that it is in evil. That this signifies that that nation is in an external separate from a holy internal, is evident from the signification of "evil," and "sin," as being disjunction, 
separation, and a turning away from the Divine (see n. 4997, 5746, 5841, 9346). It is said "separate from a holy internal," because the external separate from the internal is also separate from 
what is holy, for what is holy of man is in his internal. That is called "holy" which flows into man out of heaven, that is, through heaven from the Lord. Heaven flows into the internal of man, and 
through this into his external, because the internal of man has been formed according to the image of heaven, thus for the reception of the spiritual things which are there; and the external has been 
formed according to the image of the world, thus for the reception of the natural things which are there (n. 9279, 10156). From this it is evident what is the quality of the man with whom the external 
is separate from the internal, namely, that he is in worldly, earthly, and bodily things only. They who are in these only, do not apprehend what the internal is, thus neither what it is to be in things 
heavenly and Divine. They suppose that when they engage in those things which belong to the external worship of the church, they are also in things Divine. Nevertheless it is not so; for at such 
times they are either in a bodily delight to which they have been accustomed from infancy, or are acting for the sake of the world and appearances, or from the duty of their office for the sake of profit 
and honor; thus they are in worldly, earthly, and bodily things; and not in things heavenly and Divine. It is otherwise with those who are in things external from what is internal. </p>

'You know the people, that they [are set] on evil' means that that nation's interest lies in what is external separated from what is holy and internal. This is clear from the meaning of 'evil' and 'sin' 
as severance, separation, and turning away from the Divine, dealt with in <a href="4997.htm">4997</a>, <a href="5746.htm">5746</a>, <a href="5841.htm">5841</a>, <a href="9346.htm">9346</a>. The words 'separated from what is holy and internal' are used because when that which is external 
is separated from what is internal it is also separated from what is holy; for what is holy in a person resides in his internal. That is called holy which flows in from heaven and resides with a person, 
that is, comes from the Lord by way of heaven. Heaven flows into a person's internal, and by way of this into his external; for a person's internal has been created so as to conform to an image of 
heaven, thus to receive spiritual things that belong there, and the external to conform to an image of the world, thus to receive natural things that belong there, <a href="9279.htm">9279</a>, <a href="10156.htm">10156</a>. From this it is evident 
what a person whose external has been separated from his internal is like, that is to say, his interest lies solely in worldly, earthly, and bodily things. Those whose interest lies solely in these have 
no understanding of what the internal is, nor thus of what a concern for heavenly and Divine things is. They suppose that when they are engaged in doing the things that compose the external worship 
of the Church they are also involved in things that are Divine. But this is not so; for at such times either the bodily delights to which they have been accustomed since they were young children rule 
their minds, or the worldly aim that they may seen by others spurs them on, or the gain to be made or the prestige to be won out of performing the duties of their office motivates them. Thus they too 
are interested in worldly, earthly, and bodily things, and not in heavenly and Divine ones. It is different with those who are interested in external things from a concern for what is internal.  </p>

`Tu nosti populum quod in malo ille': quod significet quod gens illa in externo sit separato a sancto interno, constat (c)a significatione `mali' et `peccati' quod sit sejunctio, separatio, et aversio 
a Divino, de qua n. 4997, 5746, 5841, 9346; dicitur separatum a sancto interno, quoniam externum separatum ab interno est quoque separatum a sancto, nam sanctum hominis est in interno ejus; sanctum 
dicitur id quod apud hominem influit e caelo, hoc est, per caelum a Domino; caelum influit in internum hominis, et per id in externum ejus, quoniam internum hominis formatum est ad imaginem caeli, ita 
ad receptionem {1}spiritualium quae ibi, et externum ad imaginem mundi,ita ad receptionem `naturalium' quae ibi,n. (x)9279, 10,156; inde patet qualis homo est apud quem externum separatum est ab interno, 
quod nempe in solis mundanis, terrestribus, et corporeis; qui in his solis sunt, nec capiunt quid internum est, ita nec quid {2}est in caelestibus et Divinis esse; putant cum in illis quae cultus 
externi Ecclesiae sunt, [quod] etiam in Divinis sint; sed usque non ita est; sunt {3}namque tunc vel in jucundo corporeo ex usu ab infantia, vel propter mundum ut appareant, vel ex debito officii propter 
lucrum {4}aut honorem; ita quoque in mundanis, terrestribus, et corporeis, et non in caelestibus et Divinis; aliter apud illos qui in externis sunt ab interno. @1 talium$ @2 sit$ @3 enim$ @4 et$ </p>
