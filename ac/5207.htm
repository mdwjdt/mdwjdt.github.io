<h3 align="center" class="ired">属天的奥秘 第5207节</h3>
<h4 align="center"></h4><p><strong>5207.</strong>“那长相俊美又肥壮的七只母牛”表属于信，也属于仁的属世层的真理。这从“母牛”、“长相俊美”和“肥壮”的含义清楚可知：“母牛”是指属世层的真理，如前所述（<a href="5198.htm">5198</a>节）；“长相俊美”是指属于信之物（<a href="5199.htm">5199</a>节）；“肥壮”是指属于仁之物（<a href="5200.htm">5200</a>节）。关于这个问题本身，即真理被在边界的虚假从属世层驱逐，要知道，这是所有重生之初的情形。因为一开始，被植入人的真理本身虽是真理，但在良善与它们联结之前，它们并非他里面的真理。一旦联结，良善就会使得真理成为真理，因为良善是内在本质，而真理是这本质的外在形式。因此，一开始，虚假离真理很近；也就是说，边界的真理在哪里，虚假也在哪里。<br />不过，良善与真理联结得有多快，虚假逃得就有多快。这在来世也是实实在在发生的事。在那里，虚假的气场依附于真理的程度，取决于有多少良善流入真理。当只有少量良善流入时，虚假的气场就近了；当更多的良善流入时，虚假的气场就退了；当良善完全联结于真理时，虚假的气场也就完全被驱散了。当虚假的气场近了时，也就是一开始的情形，如刚才说的，真理可以说被驱逐。事实上，它们暂时隐藏在更内在的地方，在那里充满良善，并从那里以连续阶段被带回。这就是“七只母牛”和“七个穗子”，以及“七个丰年”和“七个荒年”所表示的。不过，人若对重生一无所知，对人的内在状态一无所知，不可能理解这些事。</p>

<p align="center"><b>Potts(1905-1910) 5207</b></p><p><b>5207.</b>
The seven kine beautiful in look and fat. That this signifies the truths of the natural that were of faith and of charity, is evident from the signification of "kine," as being truths of the natural 
(of which above, n. 5198); and from the signification of "beautiful in look," as being that were of faith (n. 5199); and from the signification of "fat," as being that were of charity (n. 5200). As regards 
the matter itself, that truths were banished from the natural by falsities in the boundaries, be it known that this takes place at the beginning in all regeneration; for the truths that are instilled 
into a man, in the beginning, are indeed in themselves truths; but they are not truths in him until good is joined to them. The good when joined causes the truths to be truths. Good is the essential, 
and truths are its forms; and therefore in the beginning falsities are near truths; that is to say, in the boundaries where truths are there also are falsities; but as fast as good is conjoined 
with the truths, the falsities take flight. This also actually takes place in the other life, where the sphere of falsity applies itself to truths according to the influx of good into the truths: when 
only a little good flows in, the sphere of falsity is near; when more good flows in, the sphere of falsity withdraws; and when good is entirely joined to truths, the sphere of falsity is also entirely 
dispelled. When the sphere of falsity is near, as is the case in the beginning, as just said, then truths seem to be banished; but they are laid by for a while in the interior where they are filled 
with good, and from thence are let back in succession. This is what is signified by the "seven kine" and the "seven ears of corn," and further on by the "seven years of great plenty" and the "seven years 
of famine;" but one who knows nothing about regeneration, and nothing about man's internal state, cannot comprehend these things. </p>

<p align="center"><b>Elliott(1983-1999) 5207</b></p><p><b>5207.</b>
'The seven cows beautiful in appearance and fat' means the truths of the natural which are expressions of faith and embodiments of charity. This is clear from the meaning of 'cows' as the truths belonging 
to the natural, dealt with above in <a href="5198.htm">5198</a>; from the meaning of 'beautiful in appearance' as expressions of faith, dealt with in <a href="5199.htm">5199</a>; and from the meaning of 'fat' as embodiments of charity, dealt 
with in <a href="5200.htm">5200</a>. As regards this particular matter - that truths were banished from the natural by falsities at the boundaries - it should be recognized that this is what happens initially whenever regeneration 
takes place. For the truths which are implanted initially in a person are in themselves truths, yet they are not truths residing with that person until good has been linked to them. Once it 
has been so linked good causes those truths to be truths indeed, for good is the inward essence, while truths are the outward form of that essence. Initially therefore falsities stand close to truths; 
that is, where at the boundaries truths are present, so also are falsities. </p>
<p></p>
<p><b>[2]</b>
 But as good is joined to the truths, the falsities are put to flight. This is what actually happens in the next life. 
There the sphere of falsity attaches itself to the truths, depending on how much good passes into the truths. When little good enters in, the sphere of falsity is nearby; when more good enters in, the 
sphere of falsity moves further away; and when good is wholly linked to the truths the sphere of falsity is completely dispersed. When the sphere of falsity is close by, which is the case initially, 
as has been stated, the truths are so to speak banished. Actually they are for the time being concealed in a more interior place where they are filled with good and from where they are brought back 
in consecutive stages. These are the considerations that are meant by seven cows and seven heads of grain, and further on by seven years of abundance of corn and by seven years of famine. But anyone who 
does not know anything about regeneration or anything about a person's internal state fails to understand any of this. </p>

</p><b>5207.</b>
`Septem vaccas pulchras aspectu et pingues':  quod significet vera naturalis quae fidei et charitatis, constat a significatione `vaccarum' quod sint vera naturalis, de qua supra n. 5198; ex significatione 
`pulchrarum aspectu' quod sint quae fidei, de qua n. 5199; et ex significatione `pinguium' quod sint quae charitatis, de qua n. 5200. Quod ipsam rem attinet, quod nempe vera exterminata sint e 
naturali per falsa in terminis, sciendum quod hoc fiat in principio in omni regeneratione, vera enim quae principio insinuantur apud hominem, sunt quidem in se vera, sed non sunt vera apud illum priusquam 
illis adjunctum est bonum; bonum adjunctum facit quod vera sint vera, bonum {1} est essentiale, et vera sunt ejus formalia, quapropter in principio prope vera sunt falsa, seu in terminis ubi vera, 
etiam sunt falsa; [2] sed sicut bonum conjungitur veris ita aufugiunt falsa; hoc quoque actualiter se ita habet in altera vita, ibi sphaera falsi applicat se veris secundum influxum boni in vera, cum 
parum boni influit, sphaera falsi prope est, cum plus boni influit, sphaera falsi removet se, et cum bonum prorsus adjunctum est veris tunc sphaera falsi quoque prorsus dissipatur; cum sphaera falsi 
prope adest, ut fit in principio, prout dictum, tunc quasi exterminantur vera, sed reconduntur interea in interiore et ibi implentur bono, ac inde successive remittuntur; haec sunt quae per `septem vaccas 
et septem aristas', et in sequentibus per `septem annos abundantiae annonae et per septem annos famis' significantur. Sed qui nihil scit de regeneratione, et qui nihil de statu interno hominis, 
illa non capit. @1 i enim$ </p>
