<h3 align="center" class="ired">属天的奥秘 第1385节</h3>
<h4 align="center"></h4><p><strong>1385.</strong>有些灵人属于皮肤区域，尤其是鳞状皮肤。他们渴望推理一切事物，却没有对善与真的直觉。事实上，他们越推理，直觉到的东西就越少。他们认为推理就等于智慧；他们这样做是为了显得他们有智慧。他们被告知，天使的智慧就在于无需推理就能直觉事物是否是善与真；但他们意识不到这种直觉的可能性。他们就是那些在世时用知识和哲学混淆真理和良善，并由此自觉比所有人都学识渊博的人；他们以前没有首先从圣言吸收真理的基本观念，结果，他们比任何人都缺乏常识。</p>

<p><strong>[NCE]1385.</strong> There are spirits belonging to the region of the skin (particularly the squamous layer) who want to argue everything.{*1} They do not perceive what is good or true, and in fact the more they argue, the less they perceive it. They identify wisdom with sophistry, which they count on to make them seem wise.{*2} I told them that the role of angelic wisdom is to perceive whether a thing is good or true without sophistic reasoning, but they cannot grasp the possibility that this kind of perception exists. They are the same people that used the academic and philosophical disciplines during bodily life to cast confusion over truth and goodness and as a result seemed to themselves to be more knowledgeable than others. (They had not started with any valid assumptions taken from the Word.) Consequently, they do not have much common sense.<br /><br /><strong>Footnotes:</strong><br />{*1} The idea that the spirits belong to the region of the skin can be understood in light of Swedenborg's claim that heaven exists in the form of a human being; see note 2 in <a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_1385/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_947" target=_top>947</a>. These particular spirits are mentioned again in <a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_1385/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_5556" target=_top>5556</a>. [Editors]<br />{*2} The Latin here is somewhat cryptic, if not actually defective: in ratiocinatione ponentes sapientiam, utque videantur, literally, " [they are] placing wisdom in sophistry, and so that they may seem." A similar passage in Spiritual Experiences (Swedenborg 1998-2002) <a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_1385/swedenborg_spiritual-experiences-odhner_3703" target=_top>3703</a> says in ratiocinatione solum ponens, ut videatur aliis quod sapiens, " [one is] placing in sophistry alone [the hope] that it may seem to others that one is wise."

<p align="center"><b>Potts(1905-1910) 1385</b></p><p><b>1385.</b>
There are spirits who belong to the province of the skin, especially the scaly skin, who desire to reason about everything; they have no perception of what is good and true; indeed the more they reason, 
the less they perceive; they make wisdom consist in reasoning, and on this base their claim to seem wise.* They have been told that it is of angelic wisdom to perceive without reasoning whether a 
thing is good and true; but they do not apprehend that such perception is possible. These are they who in the life of the body had confused truth and good by means of matters of knowledge and of philosophy, 
and thereby had seemed to themselves to be pre-eminently learned; but as they had not previously adopted any principles of truth from the Word, they have less common sense than others. * Compare 
Arcana 5556, and Spiritual Experiences 3703. [REVISER.] </p>

There are spirits who belong to the province of the skin, especially its scaly area, who wish to reason about everything, but who have no perception of what good or truth is. Indeed, the more they go 
on reasoning the less they perceive. They identify reasoning with wisdom; and they do this so that they may appear wise. They have been told that angelic wisdom involves perceiving whether a thing is 
good or true without reasoning about it, but they have no conception of the possibility of a perception such as this. They are people who during their lifetime had thrown truth and good into confusion 
by means of scientific and philosophical arguments, and in so doing had seemed to themselves to be more learned than everybody else; but they had not in the first place grasped from the Word any basic 
ideas of truth, as a result of which they possess less common sense than anybody else </p>

<p align="center"><b>Latin(1748-1756) 1385</b>
</p><b>1385.</b>
Sunt spiritus qui ad provinciam cutis imprimis squamosae pertinent, qui de omnibus volunt ratiocinari, nihil percipientes quid bonum et verum, immo quo magis ratiocinantur eo minus percipiunt, in ratiocinatione 
ponentes sapientiam, utque videantur; iis dictum quod sapientiae angelicae sit percipere num bonum et verum absque ratiocinatione; sed ii non capiunt quod dabilis talis perceptio; sunt illi 
qui in vita corporis confuderant verum et bonum per scientifica et philosophica, et inde visi sibi doctiores aliis, nec prius ulla principia veri captarunt ex Verbo; quibus inde minus sensus communis. </p>
