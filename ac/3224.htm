<h3 align="center" class="ired">属天的奥秘 第3224节</h3>
<h4 align="center"></h4><p><strong>3224.</strong>令人惊讶的是，人尚不知道自己的智力就居于完全不同于尘世之光的一种光中。但人类的状况是这样：对于那些居于尘世之光的人来说，天堂之光如同黑暗；而对于那些居于天堂之光的人来说，尘世之光则如同黑暗。这种差异主要缘于不同的爱，也就是不同种类的光之热。那些沉浸于对自我和这个世界的爱，因而只感受尘世之光的热之人唯独受恶与假影响；而这些恶与假就是那扑灭属天堂之光的真理之物。但那些充满对主之爱和对邻之爱，从而感受属天堂之光的属灵之热的人则受扑灭虚假的良善与真理影响。不过，后者仍具有一种对应关系。<br />诚然，在来世，只对属尘世之光的事物感兴趣，从而受源于邪恶的虚假影响的灵人也拥有来自天堂的光，但它就像一束昏昧之光，或如同燃煤或火把所发出的光。可天堂之光一靠近，这光就立刻熄灭，变成浓重的黑暗。那些处于这光的人都处在幻想中，他们将在幻想中所看到的事物视为真理，并且在他们看来，别的东西都不是真理。他们的幻想还与肮脏淫秽的物体紧紧绑在一起，他们以这类事物为最大快乐，以致他们像精神错乱的疯子那样思考。对于虚假，他们不会停下来推理这些是否正确，而是立刻肯定它们。但对良善与真理，他们则一直进行推理，最终否定它们。<br />来自天堂之光的真理与良善流入内层心智，而他们的内层已经关闭；因此，这光仅流入该心智的周边和外围，并变得只能被他们视为真理的虚假所调节。除了那些内层心智已经打开的人外，真理与良善得不到认可。来自主的光流入内层心智，并且该心智越打开，真理与良善就越被认可。内层心智只在那些处于纯真，处于对主之爱和对邻之仁的人身上被打开，在那些处于信之真理的人身上则打不开，除非他们同时处于生命的良善。</p>

It is surprising that man does not as yet know that his intellectual mind is in a certain light that is altogether different from the light of the world; but such is the condition that to those who are 
in the light of the world the light of heaven is as it were darkness, and to those who are in the light of heaven the light of the world is as it were darkness. This arises principally from the loves, 
which are the heats of the light. They who are in the loves of self and of the world, thus only in the heat of the light of the world, are affected solely by evils and falsities, and these are the 
things which extinguish truths, which are of the light of heaven. But they who are in love to the Lord and in love toward the neighbor, thus in spiritual heat, which is of the light of heaven, are affected 
with goods and truths, which extinguish falsities; but still with these persons there exists a correspondence.  [2] Spirits who are only in the things which are of the light of the world, and 
are thence in falsities derived from evils, have indeed light from heaven in the other life, but such a light as is fatuous, or as that which issues from a lighted coal or firebrand; but on the approach 
of the light of heaven this light is at once extinguished, and becomes thick darkness. They who are in this light are in phantasies, and the things which they see in phantasies they believe to be truths, 
nor to them is anything else truth. Their phantasies are also closely bound to filthy and obscene objects, with which they are most especially delighted; thus they think like persons who are insane 
and delirious. In regard to falsities, they do not reason whether these be so or not, but they instantly affirm them; whereas in regard to goods and truths they carry on a continual ratiocination, 
which terminates in what is negative. [3] For truths and goods, which are from the light of heaven, flow into the interior mind, which with them is closed; wherefore the light flows in around and outside 
of this mind, and becomes such that it is modified solely by the falsities which appear to them as truths. Truths and goods cannot be acknowledged, except with those whose interior mind is open, 
into which the light from the Lord may inflow; and so far as this mind is open, truths and goods are acknowledged. This mind is open only with those who are in innocence, in love to the Lord, and in 
charity toward their neighbor; but not with those who are in the truths of faith, unless they are at the same time in the good of life. </p>

It is amazing that man does not yet know that his intellectual powers dwell in a certain light that is altogether different from the light of the world. But the human condition is such that to those 
who dwell in the light of the world the light of heaven is as though it were darkness, and to those who dwell in the light of heaven the light of the world is as though it were darkness. This difference 
is due primarily to differing loves, which are different types of heat accompanying light. Those who are steeped in self-love and love of the world, and so who feel no warmth apart from that accompanying 
the light of the world, are influenced solely by evils and falsities; and these are such as obliterate truths which belong to the light of heaven. But those who are suffused with love to the Lord 
and love towards the neighbour, and so who feel the spiritual warmth which belongs to the light of heaven, are influenced by goods and truths which obliterate falsities. But with the latter a correspondence 
nevertheless exists. </p>
<p></p>
<p><b>[2]</b>
 Spirits who are interested only in the things that belong to the light of the world, and who are consequently under the influence of falsities derived from evils, 
do indeed in the next life have light from heaven, but it is like a feeble light shed by that of an ignis fatuus, and like that emitted from a burning coal or a firebrand. This light however, as the 
light of heaven draws near, is instantly extinguished and turns into thick darkness. Those who see in that light are subject to delusions, and the things they see in their delusions they believe to be 
truths; and to them none else are truths. Their delusions are also tied up with filthy and disgusting objects in which they take very great delight, so that in their thinking they are like those who 
are crazy and insane. Where falsities are concerned they do not stop and reason whether these are accurate or not, but instantly affirm that they are so; but where goods and truths are concerned they 
engage all the time in reasoning, which ends in denial of them. </p>
<p></p>
<p><b>[3]</b>
 For truths and goods received from the light of heaven flow into the interior mind which with those people is closed, and therefore 
that light flows around outside that mind, and becomes such that it is modified only by the falsities which appear to them as truths. Truths and goods cannot be acknowledged except with those whose 
interior mind has been opened. Into that mind light from the Lord flows in, and to the extent it has been opened those things are acknowledged. That mind has been opened only with those in whom innocence, 
love to the Lord, and charity towards the neighbour are present. It is not opened with those in whom truths of faith are present unless goodness of life is present at the same time. </p>

Mirum est quod homo nondum sciat quod mens sua intellectualis in quadam luce sit, quae prorsus alia est a luce mundi; sed talis est {1}conditio ut qui in luce mundi sunt, illis lux caeli sint quasi 
tenebrae, et qui in luce caeli, illis lux mundi sint quasi tenebrae; hoc principaliter venit ex amoribus, qui sunt calores lucis; qui in amoribus sui et mundi sunt, ita in solo calore lucis mundi, illi 
{2}tantummodo afficiuntur malis et falsis, et haec sunt quae exstinguunt vera quae sunt lucis caeli: qui autem in amore in Dominum et amore erga proximum sunt, ita in calore spirituali, qui est lucis 
caeli, illi afficiuntur bonis et veris quae exstinguunt falsa, sed usque apud hos datur correspondentia. [2] Spiritus qui solum in illis quae lucis mundi, {4}et inde in falsis e malis, sunt, illi in 
altera vita quidem lucem e caelo habent, sed talem lucem {5}qualis est fatua, et qualis {6}ex carbone ignito aut torre effluit, sed haec lux ilico exstinguitur appropinquante luce caeli, et fit caligo; 
qui in illa luce sunt, in phantasiis sunt; et quae in phantasiis vident, credunt vera, nec alia illis vera sunt; phantasiae illorum etiam alligatae sunt objectis spurcis et obscenis, quibus maxime 
delectantur, ita cogitant sicut deliri ac insani; de falsis non ratiocinantur num ita sit, sed affirmant momento, at de bonis et veris continua est illis ratiocinatio, quae terminatur in negativum: [3] 
vera enim et bona quae a luce caeli, influunt in interiorem mentem, quae illis est clausa, quare lux circum et extra illam influit, et fit talis ut non nisi quam a falsis apparentibus illis ut veris 
modificetur; vera et bona non agnosci possunt quam apud illos quibus interior illa mens aperta est, in quam lux a Domino influat, quae quantum aperta est, tantum illa agnoscuntur: illa mens aperta est 
solum apud illos qui in innocentia sunt, in amore in Dominum, et in charitate erga proximum; non autem apud illos qui in veris fidei nisi simul in bono vitae sunt. @1 probably condicio is meant$  @2 
tantum$  @3 falsa$  @4 sunt, seu qui in falsis e malis$  @5 quae dicitur$  @6 lux ex igne carbonario$  </p>
