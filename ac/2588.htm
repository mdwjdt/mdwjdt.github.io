<h3 align="center" class="ired">属天的奥秘 第2588节</h3>
<h4 align="center"></h4><p><strong>2588.</strong>“为亚伯拉罕的妻子”表为了属灵真理能与属天良善结合。这从作为妻子的“撒拉”和“亚伯拉罕”的代表性清楚可知：作为妻子的“撒拉”是指与属天良善结合的属灵真理（参看<a href="1468.htm">1468</a>，<a href="1901.htm">1901</a>，<a href="2063.htm">2063</a>，<a href="2065.htm">2065</a>，<a href="2172.htm">2172</a>，<a href="2173.htm">2173</a>，<a href="2198.htm">2198</a>，<a href="2507.htm">2507</a>节）；“亚伯拉罕”是指与属灵真理结合的属灵良善（参看<a href="2010.htm">2010</a>，<a href="2172.htm">2172</a>，<a href="2198.htm">2198</a>，<a href="2501.htm">2501</a>节）。无论你说“属灵真理与属天良善”，还是说主，意思都一样。因为主就是真理本身和良善本身，也是真理与良善，并良善与真理的婚姻本身。其中的情形通过所给出的解读就能看出来，但这些事属于如今很模糊的那类事，故我们尽可能阐明它们。此处所论述的主题是信之教义，主在童年时就思索过信之教义；也就是说，祂曾想过能否凭理性事物进入它，从而为自己形成关于它的概念。祂的这种想法出于祂对人类的爱和考虑，因为人类具有这样的特点：凡无法以理性方式来理解的事，他们根本不相信。但祂通过神性发觉，以这种方式进入教义是不可以的，故祂通过神性将这类教义揭示给自己，同时也将从属的宇宙万事万物，也就是一切理性类的事物和一切属世类的事物揭示给自己。<br />前面已说明（<a href="2568.htm">2568</a>节）人们对信之教义所持的态度。也就是说，他们出于两种基本心态进行思考，即否定心态和肯定心态；凡若不凭理性事物和记忆知识，甚至凭感官经验来理解就什么也不信的人，皆出于否定心态来思考；凡相信事情是真的，因为主在圣言中就是这么说的，从而信靠主之人则出于肯定心态来思考。对圣言中任何事的真实性持否定态度的人会发自内心说，等到被理性事物和记忆知识说服了，他们就会相信。而事实上，他们永远不会相信，甚至若不凭自己的肉体感觉，即视觉、听觉和触觉信服，就不会相信；因为他们总能制造出新的推理来反对这类事，直到完全毁灭一切信才会罢休，同时将理性之光转为黑暗，因为他们会将它转为虚假。然而，持肯定态度的人，也就是那些相信事情是真的，因为主就是这么说的之人不断凭理性事物和记忆知识，甚至感官经验得以确认，同时他们的观念也通过这些事物得到启示和强化；因为光会通过他们所拥有的理性事物和记忆知识，而非其它渠道临到他们，并且人人都是这种情况。对那些具有肯定心态的人来说，教义必是活的；经上论到他们说，他们被医好了，能生育。但对那些具有否定心态的人来说，教义必死亡；经上论到他们说，子宫被完全关闭了。所有这一切表明，什么叫凭理性事物进入信之教义，什么又叫通过信之教义进入理性事物。<br />举例说明当中的区别：圣言教导说，教义的首要原则就是对主之爱和对邻之仁。对此持肯定态度的人照各自的天赋、知识和经验能进入理性和记忆的任何事物，若乐意，甚至能进入感觉类的任何事物。事实上，他们越进入，就越得以确认；因为整个自然界都充满确认之物。但是，否认教义的这一首要原则，想先凭理性和记忆的事物来信服事情的真实性之人则不让自己信服，因为他们发自内心否认，并且一直站在某个他们以之为根本的其它原则的立场上，最终通过确认他们的原则而弄瞎自己的双眼，以至于甚至不知道何为爱主爱邻。他们因确认反面，故最终确认这个观点：除了对自我和这个世界的爱以外，其它爱里面不可能有任何快乐。他们即使不以教义认可这一观点，也会以所过的生活来认可它，甚至到了信奉地狱之爱，而非天堂之爱的地步。那些尚未持否定态度，也未持肯定态度，而是处于否认或肯定之前的怀疑状态之人的情形已在前面说明（<a href="2568.htm">2568</a>节），也就是说，倾向于邪恶生活的人会落入否定态度，而倾向于良善生活的人则被带入肯定态度。<br />另举一例：信之教义的首要观念之一是：一切善皆来自主，一切恶皆来自人，即来自人的自我。对此持肯定态度的人能通过很多理性观念和事实来确认。如良善只能从良善本身，即良善的源泉，因而从主流入，良善之初不可能在其它地方。这种人会在为真理的一切事物、他们自己、其他人、整个社会以及整个受造宇宙中发现这些观念。但是，持否定态度的人则通过他们所想到的一切事物来确认反面，以致最后他们甚至不知道何为良善，还争论他们自己当中的最高等的良善是什么，对以下事实极度无知：即一切低等的良善都凭主的属天和属灵之善而存活，由此而来的快乐才是真快乐。有些人还以从，良善若非来自他们自己，就绝不可能出自其它源头。<br />再以下面的真理为例：那些由对主之爱和对邻之仁所主导的人能接受教义的真理，并且相信圣言，而那些过着我欲和物欲生活的人则不然。或也可说，那些由良善所主导的人能相信，而那些由邪恶所主导的人不相信。持肯定态度的人能凭理性和记忆的事物以无数种方式确认这一真理。他们能凭理性确认：真理与良善匹配，与邪恶不匹配；一切虚假皆居于邪恶，故也来自邪恶；由邪恶所主导的人即便拥有真理，这真理也只是在口头上，而非在心里。他们能凭记忆知识通过很多观点确认：真理避开邪恶，邪恶憎恶真理。但持否定态度的人则确认这一观念：每个人，无论其秉性如何，都能象其他人那样去相信，哪怕他过着不断憎恨的生活，以报复、欺骗为乐。当持有这种观念时，他们自己通过教义完全拒绝生活的良善，并且拒绝之后便什么也不信了。<br />为了使这个问题更清楚，我们举这个例子：圣言是照着拥有未显明在字面上的内义而写就的。对此持肯定态度的人能通过理性分析来确认。如：人凭圣言与天堂相联；属世之物与属灵之物存在对应关系，尽管在属世之物中看不到属灵之物；内在思维观念完全不同于落入言语中的物质观念；人是为两种生活而生的，故在世时也能凭圣言处于天堂，圣言适合这两个世界；对有些人来说，当阅读圣言时，某种神性之光会流入理解力之物，也流入情感；有必要的是，从天而降的某种事物当写下来，因此圣言在其源头中的样子，不可能和字面上的一样；圣言只凭它里面所拥有的某种圣洁而神圣。他也能凭记忆来确认，如：过去，人们生活在代表物的时代；古教会的着述就含有这类代表物，很多外邦人的着述也由代表物构成；正因如此，这种写作风格在教会被视为神圣，在外邦人中被视为学问（我还能列出许多这类着者的书籍）。而持否定态度的人尽管不否认所有这些事，但仍不相信它们。他们说服自己说，圣言的样子和字面上的一样，事实上，显得世俗，但仍是属灵的。然而，他们对其中的属灵元素没有任何兴趣，而是以种种理由情愿它就是那样；并且他们能用很多事来确认这一点。<br />为将这个问题以普通人也能理解的方式呈现出来，下面以众所周知的事实为例：透过眼睛这个肉体器官看见世上物体的视觉并不属于肉眼，而是属于灵。对此持肯定态度的人能通过很多事物来确认这一事实。如：通过我们听见别人所说的话，因为这些话会将自身交付给内在视觉，它们会转化为内在视觉；若内在视觉不存在，这是不可能的事。内在视觉能看到所思想的任何事物，有的相对清楚些，有的相对模糊些。再比如，我们想象的事物与眼见的实际物体没什么不同。又如，若非身体里面的灵看见落入眼睛这个视觉器官视野内的物体，灵在来世无法看见任何事物，而事实是，灵定能看到肉眼所看不到的无数令人难以置信的事物。此外，我们可以深入思考一下，在梦里，尤其在先知的梦里，很多事物能被看到，但都不是用肉眼看到的。最后，若有人精通哲学，他可通过以下分析来确认：外在事物无法进入内在事物，就象复杂物无法进入简单物一样；因此，身体的事物无法进入灵的事物，只有反过来才行。除此之外还有其它大量证据，直到此人最终信服，视觉属于灵，但不属于眼睛，除非通过灵。而持否定态度的人却将诸如此类的分析要么视为属世和肉体的事，要么视为幻想；当被告知，灵人所拥有并享受的视觉，远比处于肉身的世人完美得多，他们就会嘲笑这种观念，并把它当成一个无聊的故事而加以排斥，因为他们以为若丧失肉眼的视觉，他们必生活在黑暗中。而事实恰好相反，到时他们会居于光中。<br />从这些例子可以看出何为通过真理进入理性和记忆知识之物，何为通过理性和记忆知识之物进入真理。前者符合次序，后者违反次序。当按次序行事时，我们就会得到启示；当违反次序行事时，我们就会瞎眼。这一切清楚表明，认识并相信真理对人来说何等重要。因为真理启发人，而虚假却使人变瞎。真理能使广阔且几乎无限的领域向理性开放，而相对来说，虚假则根本提供不了任何这样的开放，尽管这一事实表面看上去并不那么明显。天使之所以享有大量智慧，就是因为他们处于真理，而真理是天堂之光本身。<br />在古代，那些因拒绝相信身体感觉所不能理解的任何事物而使自己变瞎，直到最后什么也不信的人被叫作“知识树的蛇”。因为这种人通过感性事物及其错觉进行大量推理，而这些事物很容易让人接受并相信，从而使众多人误入歧途（参看<a href="195.htm">195</a>，<a href="196.htm">196</a>节）。在来世，这种人通过以下事实很容易与其他灵人区分开：在关乎信的一切事上，他们都会推理事情是否如此；即便向他们证明一千次，再证明一千次，他们仍会提出否定性的质疑，来反对向他们所提供的每个证明；并且他们会一直这样进行下去，直到永远。因此缘故，他们如此盲目，以至于缺乏常识，也就是说，他们无法理解何为善与真。然而，他们当中的每一个都认为自己比全宇宙所有人更有智慧，认为智慧就在于能证明神性之物是错的，并通过属世之物来推论它。很多在世时被视为智者的人就有这种显着特征。因为具有否定心态的人越有天赋和知识，就越疯狂，比其他所有人更甚。而具有肯定心态的人越有天赋和知识，就越能变得更智慧。绝不可否认，人可以通过记忆知识发育理性，但人不可以用记忆知识来使自己强硬反对属于圣言的信之真理。<br />这些事在圣言的内义中有大量论述，尤其在预言部分，那里论述了亚述和埃及，因为“亚述”表推理（<a href="119.htm">119</a>，<a href="1186.htm">1186</a>节），“埃及”表记忆知识（<a href="1164.htm">1164</a>，<a href="1165.htm">1165</a>，<a href="1186.htm">1186</a>，<a href="1462.htm">1462</a>节）。关于那些想通过记忆知识和理性事物进入教义和神性事物的人，我们在以赛亚书中读到：<br />我必在埃及激动埃及人，他们就打起仗来，各人攻打自己的弟兄，各人攻打自己的同伴，城攻打城，国攻打国；埃及人的灵必在它当中耗尽，我必败坏他们的谋略；海中的水必绝尽，河也消没干涸；江流要消失，埃及的河水都必减少枯干，苇子和芦荻都必衰残；一切河的种都必枯干。耶和华使乖谬的灵搀入她中间，他们使埃及一切所做的都有差错，好像醉酒之人呕吐的时候，东倒西歪一样。（以赛亚书<a href="http://39-27.cn/赛19.2.htm">19:2</a>-<a href="http://39-27.cn/赛19.3.htm">3</a>；<a href="http://39-27.cn/赛19.5.htm">5</a>-<a href="http://39-27.cn/赛19.7.htm">7</a>，<a href="http://39-27.cn/赛19.14.htm">14</a>）<br />同一先知书：<br />祸哉！这悖逆的儿女。他们起身下埃及去，并没有求问我的口。要靠法老的力量加添自己的力量，并投在埃及的荫下。法老的力量必作你们的羞辱；投在埃及的荫下，必成为你们的羞愧。（以赛亚书<a href="http://39-27.cn/赛30.1.htm">30:1</a>-<a href="http://39-27.cn/赛30.3.htm">3</a>）<br />同一先知书：<br />祸哉！那些下埃及求帮助的，是因仗赖马匹，倚靠甚多的车辆，却不仰望以色列的圣者，也不求问耶和华。耶和华必伸手，那帮助人的必绊跌；那受帮助的也必跌倒，都一同灭亡。亚述人必倒在刀下，并非人的刀；有刀要将他吞灭，并非人的刀。（以赛亚书<a href="http://39-27.cn/赛31.1.htm">31:1</a>，<a href="http://39-27.cn/赛31.3.htm">3</a>，<a href="http://39-27.cn/赛31.8.htm">8</a>）<br />耶利米书：<br />因为我的百姓做了两件恶事，就是离弃我这活水的泉源，为自己凿出池子，是破裂不能存水的池子。以色列是仆人吗？是家中生的奴仆吗？为何成为掠物呢？这事临到你身上，不是你自招的吗？不是因耶和华你神在路上引导你的时候，你离弃他吗？现今你为何在埃及路上要喝西曷的水呢？你为何在亚述路上要喝大河的水呢？这世代的人哪，你们要看明耶和华的话！我岂向以色列作旷野呢？或作幽暗之地呢？我的百姓为何说，我们要做自己的主人，再不归向你了？你为何东跑西奔，要更换你的路呢？你必因埃及蒙羞，像从前因亚述蒙羞一样。（耶利米书<a href="http://39-27.cn/耶2.13.htm">2:13</a>，<a href="http://39-27.cn/耶2.14.htm">14</a>，<a href="http://39-27.cn/耶2.17.htm">17</a>，<a href="http://39-27.cn/耶2.18.htm">18</a>，<a href="http://39-27.cn/耶2.31.htm">31</a>，<a href="http://39-27.cn/耶2.36.htm">36</a>）<br />同一先知书：<br />你们所剩下的犹大人哪，要听耶和华的话！万军之耶和华以色列的神如此说，你们若定意转面进入埃及，到那里寄居，那么，你们所惧怕的刀剑，在埃及地必追上你们！你们所惧怕的饥荒在埃及要紧紧地跟随你们！你们必死在那里！所有定意转面进入埃及在那里寄居的男人，必遭刀剑、饥荒、瘟疫而死，无一人存留，从我降与你们的灾祸面前逃脱。（耶利米书<a href="http://39-27.cn/耶42.15.htm">42:15</a>-<a href="http://39-27.cn/耶42.17.htm">17</a>等）<br />以西结书：<br />埃及一切的居民，因向以色列家成了芦苇的杖，就知道我是耶和华。他们用手持住你，你就断折，伤了他们的肩；他们倚靠你，你就断折，闪了他们的腰。所以主耶和华如此说，看哪，我必使刀剑临到你，从你那里将人与牲畜剪除。埃及地必荒废凄凉，他们就知道我是耶和华。因为法老说，这河是我的，是我所造的。（以西结书<a href="http://39-27.cn/结29.6.htm">29:6</a>-<a href="http://39-27.cn/结29.9.htm">9</a>等）<br />何西阿书：<br />以法莲好像愚蠢无知的鸽子。他们求告埃及，投奔亚述。他们去的时候，我必将我的网撒在他们身上。他们有祸阿！因他们离弃我。（何西阿书<a href="http://39-27.cn/何7.11.htm">7:11</a>-<a href="http://39-27.cn/何7.13.htm">13</a>）<br />同一先知书：<br />以法莲吃风，且追赶东风，终日不断加多虚谎和强暴，与亚述立约，把油送到埃及。（何西阿书<a href="http://39-27.cn/何12.1.htm">12:1</a>）<br />同一先知书：<br />以色列行邪淫离弃你的神，在各谷场上如妓女喜爱淫资。以法莲却要归回埃及，必在亚述吃不洁净的食物。看哪！他们逃避灾难，埃及人必收殓他们；摩弗人必埋葬他们。他们用银子做的美物上必长蒺藜；他们的帐棚中必生荆棘。以法莲受责罚，他们的根枯干了，必不能结果；即或生产，我必杀他们他们所爱的胎儿。我的神必弃绝他们，因为他们不听从他；他们也必飘流在列族中。（何西阿书<a href="http://39-27.cn/何9.1.htm">9:1</a>，<a href="http://39-27.cn/何9.3.htm">3</a>，<a href="http://39-27.cn/何9.6.htm">6</a>，<a href="http://39-27.cn/何9.16.htm">16</a>，<a href="http://39-27.cn/何9.17.htm">17</a>）<br />以赛亚书：<br />有祸呀，亚述，我怒气的棍子，他是我愤怒之杖，在他们手中。然而，他不思想正直，他心里也不打算正直。他心里倒想毁灭、剪除不少的民族，因为他说，我的臣仆岂不都是王吗？我必罚亚述王自大的心，因为他说，我所成就的事，是靠我手的能力和我的智慧，我本有聪明。我挪移列民的地界，抢夺他们的财宝，并且我像勇士，使居民低落。因此，主万军之主必使亚述王的肥壮人变为瘦弱，在他的荣华之下必有火着起，如同焚烧一样。（以赛亚书<a href="http://39-27.cn/赛10.5.htm">10:5</a>，<a href="http://39-27.cn/赛10.7.htm">7</a>，<a href="http://39-27.cn/赛10.8.htm">8</a>，<a href="http://39-27.cn/赛10.12.htm">12</a>，<a href="http://39-27.cn/赛10.13.htm">13</a>，<a href="http://39-27.cn/赛10.16.htm">16</a>）<br /><br />在上述经文中，“亚述”如前所示，表推理；“埃及”和“法老”表记忆知识；“以法莲”表心智的理解力部分。这些以及很多其它经文描述了当人出于否定心态推理信之真理时，人类理性会变成何等性质。类似教导体现在以赛亚书中36和37章），在那里我们读到，当拉伯沙基受亚述王的差遣，公开反对耶路撒冷和希西家王时，耶和华的使者在亚述王的营中杀了十八万五千人。这些描述表示，当人推理反对神性事物时，构成其理性的一切何等混乱，无论那时他感觉自己多么有智慧。<br />这种推理在各处还被称为“与埃及人和亚述人行淫”。如以西结书：<br />你和你邻邦身体肥大的埃及人行淫，加增你的淫乱。你又与亚述人行淫，仍不满意。（以西结书<a href="http://39-27.cn/结16.26.htm">16:26</a>，<a href="http://39-27.cn/结16.28.htm">28</a>；<a href="http://39-27.cn/结23.3.htm">23:3</a>，<a href="http://39-27.cn/结23.5.htm">5</a>-<a href="http://39-27.cn/结23.21.htm">21</a>；参看<w1>2466<w2>2466<w3>节）<br />通过信之教义进入理性事物和记忆知识，并由此变得智慧之人则在以赛亚书中有所提及：<br />当那日，在埃及地中必有为耶和华筑的一座坛；在埃及的边界上必有为耶和华立的一根柱。这都要在埃及地为万军之耶和华作记号和证据。埃及人因为受人的欺压向耶和华哀叫，祂就差遣一位救主和首领给他们，祂必拯救他们。耶和华必使自己被埃及人所认识，在那日，埃及人必认识耶和华，也要献上祭物和供物，并向耶和华许愿还愿。（以赛亚书<a href="http://39-27.cn/赛19.19.htm">19:19</a>-<a href="http://39-27.cn/赛19.21.htm">21</a>）<br /><br />当那日，必有从埃及通亚述去的大道，亚述人要进入埃及，埃及人要服侍亚述。当那日，以色列必与埃及、亚述三国一律，使地当中的人得福，因为万军之耶和华赐福给他们说，埃及我的百姓，亚述我手的工作，以色列我的产业，都有福了！（以赛亚书<a href="http://39-27.cn/赛19.23.htm">19:23</a>-<a href="http://39-27.cn/赛19.25.htm">25</a>）<br />这论述的是属灵的教会，以色列是该教会的属灵元素，亚述是指它的理性，埃及是指它的认知能力。这三者构成该教会一切觉性事物，这些事物依次相随。这解释了为何经上说：“当那日，以色列必与埃及、亚述三国一律”，“埃及我的百姓，亚述我手的工作，以色列我的产业，都有福了”。<br />同一先知书：<br />当那日，必大发角声，在亚述地将要灭亡的，并在埃及地被赶散的，都要来，他们就在耶路撒冷圣山上敬拜耶和华。（以赛亚书<a href="http://39-27.cn/赛27.13.htm">27:13</a>）<br />同一先知书：<br /><br />耶和华如此说，埃及劳碌得来的和古实的货物必归你，身量高大的西巴人必过来归你，也要属你。他们必随从你，又向你下拜，向你祈求你说，神真在你们中间，此外再没有别神！（以赛亚书<a href="http://39-27.cn/赛45.14.htm">45:14</a>）<br />“古实和西巴”是指认知（<a href="117.htm">117</a>，<a href="1171.htm">1171</a>节）。撒迦利亚书：<br />埃及必上到耶路撒冷敬拜大君王万军之耶和华。（撒迦利亚书<a href="http://39-27.cn/亚14.17.htm">14:17</a>，<a href="http://39-27.cn/亚14.18.htm">18</a>）<br />弥迦书：<br />至于我，我要仰望耶和华，要等候那救我的神，我的神必垂听我。在这一天，你的墙垣重修的日子必到；他们必从亚述，从埃及的城邑，从埃及到大河，都归到你这里。（弥迦书<a href="http://39-27.cn/弥7.7.htm">7:7</a>，<a href="http://39-27.cn/弥7.11.htm">11</a>，<a href="http://39-27.cn/弥7.12.htm">12</a>）<br />以西结书：<br />主耶和华如此说，四十年终了以后，我必招聚分散在各民中的埃及人，我必叫埃及被掳的人回来。（以西结书<a href="http://39-27.cn/结29.13.htm">29:13</a>，<a href="http://39-27.cn/结29.14.htm">14</a>）<br />同一先知书：<br />看哪，亚述曾如黎巴嫩中的香柏树，枝条荣美，影密如林，极其高大，它的枝子在杂乱的树枝中间。众水使它生长，所栽之地有江河围流，汊出的水道延到田野诸树。所以它高大超过田野诸树；枝子繁多，因得大水之力枝条长长。空中的飞鸟都在枝子上搭窝；田野的走兽都在枝条下生子；所有大民族都在它荫下居住。树大条长，成为荣美，因为根在众水之中。神园中的香柏树不能遮蔽它。松树不及它的枝子。神园中的树都没有它荣美。我使它的枝条蕃多，成为荣美，以致神伊甸园中的树都嫉妒它。（以西结书<a href="http://39-27.cn/结31.3.htm">31:3</a>-<a href="http://39-27.cn/结31.9.htm">9</a>）<br />此处描述了属天的上古教会的理性、因而智慧和聪明的性质，因为该教会通过神性事物看待之下的事物。因此，它通过良善本身看待真理，然后通过真理看待所属的事物。“亚述”和“香柏树”是指理性；“它的枝子在杂乱的树枝中间”是指记忆知识；“众水和诸树”是指属灵的良善，它的根就在其中；“它的枝条又高又长”是指它的延伸；“神园”是指属灵的教会；“伊甸的诸树”是指直觉。由此和上述经文可以看出，当从属于神性真理，并通过确认这些真理而服务它们时，人类理性是何性质，人的认知能力又是何性质。<br />理性事物和记忆知识为具有肯定心态的人服务，是使他们变得智慧的一种手段。这一事实就是以色列人向埃及人要金器、银器和衣裳的命令（出埃及记<a href="http://39-27.cn/出3.22.htm">3:22</a>；<a href="http://39-27.cn/出11.2.htm">11:2</a>；<a

/>耶和华必巡视推罗，她就仍得妓女的雇价，与地面世上的万国行淫。它的货财和淫资要归耶和华为圣，必不积攒存留；因为它的货财必为住在耶和华面前的人所得，使他们吃饱，穿耐久的衣服。（以赛亚书<a href="http://39-27.cn/赛23.17.htm">23:17</a>，<a href="http://39-27.cn/赛23.18.htm">18</a>）<br />“推罗的货财”表认知（<a href="1201.htm">1201</a>节），对那些具有否定心态的人来说，它们就是妓女的淫资，而那些具有肯定心态的人来说，它们如同圣物。主下面的话也表示类似的事：<br />要借着那不义的钱财结交朋友，在你们没落的时候，好叫他们他们收留你们到永远的住处去；倘若你们在不义的钱财上不忠心，谁还把那真实的钱财托付你们呢？（路加福音<a

Abraham's wife. That this signifies in order that spiritual truth might be conjoined with celestial good, is evident from the representation of Sarah as a wife, as being spiritual truth conjoined with 
celestial good (see n. 1468, 1901, 2063, 2065, 2172, 2173, 2198, 2507); and from the representation of Abraham, as being celestial good conjoined with spiritual truth (see n. 2011, 2172, 2198, 2501). 
Whether we say "spiritual truth and celestial good," or "the Lord," it is the same; because the Lord is truth itself and good itself, and is the very marriage itself of truth and good, and of good and 
truth. How the case herein is can indeed be seen from the explication; but as these matters are among those which are obscure at this day, we may so far as possible illustrate them. The subject here 
treated of is the doctrine of faith, concerning which the Lord thought in His childhood, namely, whether it was allowable to enter into it by means of rational things, and thus form for one's self ideas 
concerning it. His so thinking came from His love and consideration for the human race, who are such as not to believe what they do not comprehend in a rational manner. But He perceived from the 
Divine that this ought not to be done; and He therefore revealed the doctrine to Himself from the Divine, and thereby at the same time all things in the universe that are subordinate, namely, all things 
of the rational and of the natural. [2] How the case is with the doctrinal things of faith among men has been stated above (n. 2568), namely, that there are two principles from which they think, a 
negative and an affirmative; and that those think from the negative principle, who believe nothing unless they are convinced by what is of reason and memory-knowledge; nay, by what is of sense; but those 
think from the affirmative who believe that things are true because the Lord has said so in the Word, thus who have faith in the Lord. They who are in the negative in regard to a thing being true 
because it is in the Word, say at heart that they will believe when they are persuaded by things rational and memory-knowledges. But the fact is that they never believe; and indeed they would not believe 
if they were to be convinced by the bodily senses of sight, hearing, and touch; for they would always form new reasonings against such things, and would thus end by completely extinguishing all faith, 
and at the same time turning the light of the rational into darkness, because into falsities. But those who are in the affirmative, that is, who believe that things are true because the Lord has 
said so, are continually being confirmed, and their ideas enlightened and strengthened, by what is of reason and memory-knowledge, and even by what is of sense; for man has light from no other source 
than by means of the things of reason and memory, and such is the way with everyone. With these the doctrine thus "living lives;" and of them it is said, that they "are healed," and "bring forth;" whereas 
with those who are in the negative the doctrine "dying dies;" and it is said of them that "the womb closing is closed." All this shows what it is to enter into the doctrine of faith by means of 
rational things, and what to enter into rational things by means of the doctrine of faith; but let this be illustrated by examples. [3] It is from the doctrine of the Word, that the first and principal 
thing of doctrine is love to the Lord and charity toward the neighbor. They who are in the affirmative in regard to this can enter into whatever things of reason and of memory, and even of sense, they 
please, everyone according to his gift, his knowledge, and his experience. Nay, the more they enter in, the more they are confirmed; for universal nature is full of confirmation. But they who deny 
this first and principal thing of doctrine, and who desire to be first convinced of anything true by means of the things of reason and memory, never suffer themselves to be convinced, because at heart 
they deny, and all the time take their stand in favor of some other principle which they believe to be essential; and finally, by confirmations of their principle they so blind themselves that they 
cannot even know what love to the Lord and love to the neighbor are. And as they confirm themselves in what is contrary, they at length confirm themselves in the notion that no other love is possible 
that has any delight in it except the love of self and of the world; and this to such a degree (if not in doctrine, yet in life) that they embrace infernal love in place of heavenly love. But with those 
who are not in the negative nor as yet in the affirmative, but are in doubt before they deny or affirm, the case is as above stated (n. 2568), namely that they who incline to a life of evil fall into 
the negative, but they who incline to a life of good are brought into the affirmative. [4] Take another example: It is among the primary things of the doctrine of faith that all good is from the Lord, 
and all evil from man, that is, from one's self. They who are in the affirmative that it is so, can confirm themselves by many things of reason and of memory-knowledge, such as that no good can possibly 
flow in except from good itself, that is, from the Fountain of Good, thus from the Lord; and that the beginning or principle of good can be from no other source; finding illustration in all things 
that are truly good, in themselves, in others, in the community, and also in the created universe. But they who are in the negative confirm themselves in what is contrary by everything they think 
of, insomuch that at last they do not know what good is; and dispute among themselves as to what is the highest good, being deeply ignorant of the fact that it is the celestial and spiritual good from 
the Lord, by which all lower good is made alive, and that the delight therefrom is truly delight. Some also think that unless good is from themselves, it cannot possibly come from any other source. [5] 
Take as another example the truth that they who are in love to the Lord and charity toward the neighbor can receive the truths of doctrine and have faith in the Word, but not they who are in the 
life of the love of self and the world; or what is the same, that they who are in good can believe, but not they who are in evil. They who are in the affirmative can confirm this by numberless things 
of reason and memory. From reason they can confirm it on the ground that truth and good agree, but not truth and evil; and that as all falsity is in evil, so it is from evil; and that if any who are in 
evil nevertheless have truth, it is on the lips, and not in the heart; and from their memory-knowledge they can confirm by many things that truths shun evils, and that evils spew out truths. But they 
who are in the negative confirm themselves by alleging that everyone, of whatever character, is able to believe just as well as others, even though he lives in continual hatred, in the delights of revenge, 
and in deceit; and this even while they themselves altogether reject from their doctrine the good of life, after the rejection of which they do not believe anything. [6] That it may be still 
more manifest how the case herein is, let us take this example: They who are in the affirmative that the Word has been so written as to possess an internal sense which does not appear in the letter, can 
confirm themselves therein by many rational considerations; as that by the Word man has connection with heaven; that there are correspondences of natural things with spiritual, in which the spiritual 
are not seen; that the ideas of interior thought are altogether different from the material ideas which fall into the words of language; that man, being born for both lives, can, while in the world, 
be also in heaven, by means of the Word which is for both worlds; that with some persons a certain Divine light flows into the things of the understanding, and also into the affections, when the Word 
is read; that it is of necessity that there should be something written that has come down from heaven, and that therefore the Word cannot be such in its origin as it is in the letter; and that it can 
be holy only from a certain holiness that it has within it. He can also confirm himself by means of memory-knowledges; as that men were formerly in representatives, and that the writings of the Ancient 
Church were of this nature; also that the writings of many among the Gentiles had this origin; and that it is on this account that in the churches such a style has been revered as holy, and among 
the Gentiles as learned, as examples of which the books of many authors might be mentioned. But they who are in the negative, if they do not deny all these things, still do not believe them, and persuade 
themselves that the Word is such as it is in the letter, appearing indeed worldly, while yet being spiritual (as to where the spiritual is hidden within it they care little, but for manifold reasons 
are willing to let it be so), and this they can confirm by many things. [7] In order to present the subject to the apprehension of the simple, take as an example the following matter of knowledge. 
They who are in the affirmative that sight is not of the eye, but of the spirit, which sees the things that are in the world through the eye as an organ of its body, can confirm themselves by many things; 
as from our hearing things said by others; in that they refer themselves to a certain interior sight, into which they are changed; which would be impossible unless there were an interior sight; 
also that whatever is thought of is seen by an interior sight, by some more clearly, by others more obscurely; and again, that things we imagine present themselves not unlike objects of sight; and also 
that unless it were the spirit within the body that saw the objects which fall within the ken of the eye as the organ of sight, the spirit could see nothing in the other life, when yet it cannot but 
be that it will see innumerable and amazing things that cannot possibly be seen with the bodily eye. Then again we may reflect that in dreams, especially those of the prophets, many things have been 
seen although not with the eyes. And finally, should anyone be skilled in philosophy, he may confirm himself by considering that outer things cannot enter into inner things, just as compounds cannot 
into simples; and therefore that things of the body cannot enter into those of the spirit, but only the reverse; not to mention a host of other proofs, until at last the man is persuaded that the spirit 
has sight, and not the eye, except from the spirit. But they who are in the negative call every consideration of this kind either a matter of nature or one of fancy, and when they are told that a spirit 
possesses and enjoys much more perfect sight than a man in the body, they ridicule the idea, and reject it as an idle tale, believing that if deprived of the sight of the bodily eye they would live 
in the dark; although the very opposite is the truth, for they are then in the light. [8] From these examples we may see what it is to enter into the things of reason and memory-knowledge from truths, 
and what it is to enter into truths from the things of reason and memory-knowledge; and that the former is according to order, but the latter contrary to order; and that when we do that which is 
according to order we are enlightened; but when we do that which is contrary to order, we are made blind. All of which shows of how great concern it is that truths should be known and believed; for man 
is enlightened by truths, but is made blind by falsities. By truths there is opened to the rational an immense and almost unbounded field; but by falsities comparatively none at all, although this 
does not appear to be so. It is because the angels are in truths that they enjoy wisdom so great; for truth is the very light of heaven. [9] They who have blinded themselves by not being willing to believe 
anything which they do not apprehend by the senses, until at length they have come to believe nothing, were in old times called "serpents of the tree of knowledge;" for such reasoned much from 
sensuous things and their fallacies, which easily fall into man's apprehension and belief, and thereby they seduced many (see n. 195, 196). In the other life such are readily distinguished from other 
spirits by the fact that in regard to all things of faith they reason whether it be so; and if they are shown a thousand and a thousand times that it is so, still they advance negative doubts against 
every proof that is offered; and this they would go on doing to all eternity. So blind are they on this account that they have not common sense, that is, they cannot comprehend what good and truth are; 
and yet every one of them thinks himself wiser than all in the universe; making wisdom to consist in being able to invalidate what is Divine, and deduce it from what is natural. Many who in this world 
have been esteemed wise, are preeminently of this character; for the more anyone is endowed with talent and knowledge, and is in the negative, the more insane he is, beyond all others; whereas the 
more anyone is endowed with talent and knowledge, and is in the affirmative, the wiser he is able to be. It is by no means denied man to cultivate the rational faculty by means of memory-knowledges; but 
that which is forbidden is to harden ourselves against the truths of faith which belong to the Word. [10] These things are much treated of in the internal sense of the Word, especially in that of 
the prophetic Word, where Asshur (or Assyria) and Egypt are treated of; for reasoning is signified by "Asshur" (n. 119, 1186); and memory-knowledge by "Egypt" (n. 1164, 1165, 1186, 1462). Concerning those 
who desire to enter into doctrinal and Divine things by means of memory-knowledges and rational things, we read in Isaiah: </p>
<p>   I will confound Egypt in Egypt, and they shall fight every man against 
his brother, and every man against his companion, city against city, and kingdom against kingdom; and the spirit of Egypt shall be made void in the midst of it, and I will swallow up the counsel thereof; 
the waters shall fail from the sea, and the river shall be dried up and shall become totally dry; and the streams shall vanish, the rivers of Egypt shall be diminished and dried up; the reed and 
the flag shall wither away; and all the seed of the river shall become dry. Jehovah hath mingled a spirit of perversities in the midst of her, and they have caused Egypt to go astray in every work thereof, 
as a drunken man strayeth in his vomit (Isa. 19:2-3; 5-7, 14).      Woe to the rebellious sons, who walk to go down into Egypt, but have not asked at My mouth, to strengthen themselves in the 
strength of Pharaoh, and to trust in the shadow of Egypt. And the strength of Pharaoh shall be unto you for a shame, and the trust in the shadow of Egypt for a reproach (Isa. 30:1-3). Woe to them that 
go down into Egypt for help, and stay upon horses, and trust in chariots, because they are many; but they look not unto the Holy One of Israel, and seek not Jehovah. And when Jehovah shall stretch 
out His hand, he that helpeth shall stumble, and he that is helped shall fall, and they shall all be consumed together. And Asshur shall fall by the sword not of man, and the sword not of man shall devour 
him (Isa. 31:1, 3, 8). In Jeremiah: </p>
<p>     My people have committed two evils; they have forsaken me, the fountain of living waters, to hew them out pits, broken pits, which can hold no water. Is 
Israel a servant? If he was born of the house, why is he become a prey? Dost thou not do this unto thyself, in that thou hast forsaken Jehovah thy God in the time when He led thee in the way? And now 
what hast thou to do with the way to Egypt to drink the waters of Shihor? Or what hast thou to do with the way of Asshur to drink the waters of the river? O generation, see ye the Word of Jehovah: have 
I been a wilderness unto Israel, a land of darkness? Wherefore said My people, We will rule, we will come no more unto Thee? Why goest thou away so much to change thy way? Thou shalt be ashamed from 
Egypt also, as thou wast ashamed from Asshur (Jer. 2:13-14, 17-18, 31, 36).      Hear ye the word of Jehovah, O remnant of Judah; thus saith Jehovah Zebaoth the God of Israel, If setting ye set your 
faces to come into Egypt, and ye come to sojourn there, then it shall come to pass that the sword which ye were fearing for yourselves shall overtake you there in the land of Egypt, and the famine whereof 
ye were afraid shall cleave unto you there in Egypt, that ye die there. So shall it be with all the men who set their faces to come into Egypt, to sojourn there; they shall die by the sword, by 
the famine, and by the pestilence; and none of them shall remain or escape from the evil that I will bring upon you (Jer. 42:15-17, etc.). In Ezekiel: </p>
<p>     And all the inhabitants of Egypt shall know 
that I am Jehovah; because they have been a staff of reed to the house of Israel; in their taking thee by thy hand thou didst break, and didst rend for them every shoulder, and in their leaning upon 
thee thou breakest, and makest all their loins to be at a stand; therefore thus said the Lord Jehovih, Behold I will bring a sword upon thee, and will cut off from thee man and beast, and the land of 
Egypt shall be a desolation and a waste, and they shall know that I am Jehovah; because he hath said, The river is mine, and I have made it (Ezek. 29:6-9, etc.). In Hosea: </p>
<p>     Ephraim was like a 
silly dove; they called unto Egypt, they went unto Asshur; when they shall go, I will spread out My net upon them; woe unto them because they have wandered away from Me (Hos. 7:11-13). Ephraim feedeth 
on wind, and followeth after the east wind; every day he multiplieth a lie and a waste, and they make a covenant with Asshur, and oil is carried down into Egypt (Hos. 12:1).      Israel hath committed 
whoredom under her God; thou hast loved hire upon all the corn floors; Ephraim shall return into Egypt, and they shall eat what is unclean in Asshur; for lo they are gone away from devastation, Egypt 
shall gather them up, Moph shall bury them, the thorn shall possess their desirable things of silver, the thistle shall be in their tents. Ephraim is smitten, their root is dried up, they shall bear 
no fruit; yea, though they bring forth yet will I slay the desired fruit of their womb; my God will cast them out, because they did not hearken unto Him, and they shall be wanderers among the nations 
(Hos. 9:1, 3, 6, 16-17). In Isaiah: </p>
<p>     Woe to Asshur, the rod of Mine anger, and he is the staff in their hand of Mine indignation; he thinketh not right, neither doth his heart meditate right; 
for it is in his heart to destroy and to cut off nations not a few; for he saith, Are not my princes all of them kings? I will visit upon the fruit of the elation of heart of the king of Asshur, for 
he hath said, In the strength of my hand I have done it, and in my wisdom, for I am intelligent; and I will remove the bounds of the peoples, and will plunder their treasures, and will cast down as a 
mighty one the inhabitants. Therefore shall the Lord of lords Zebaoth send among his fat ones leanness; and instead of his glory, kindling there shall be kindled a burning of fire (Isa. 10:5, 7-8, 12-13, 
16). [11] In all these passages, by "Asshur" as before shown is signified reasoning; by "Egypt" and "Pharaoh" memory-knowledge; by "Ephraim" the intellectual; and there is described in these and 
in many other places of what quality man's rational becomes when it reasons concerning the truths of faith from the negative principle. The like is involved in Isaiah (chapters 36 and 37), where we read 
that when Rabshakeh, sent by the king of Asshur, spoke against Jerusalem and king Hezekiah, the Angel of Jehovah smote a hundred and eighty-five thousand in the camp of the king of Asshur; by which 
is signified what an overthrow of man's reasonings takes place when he reasons against Divine things, however much the man may then appear to himself to be wise. [12] This reasoning is also in various 
places called "whoredom with the sons of Egypt and with the sons of Asshur." As in Ezekiel: </p>
<p>     Thou hast committed whoredom with the sons of Egypt, thy neighbors, great of flesh, and hast multiplied 
thy whoredom and hast committed whoredom with the sons of Asshur, and yet thou wast not satisfied (Ezek. 16:26, 28; 23:3, 5-21; see n. 2466). [13] Concerning those who enter into rational things 
and memory-knowledges from the doctrine of faith, and thence are wise. In Isaiah: </p>
<p>     In that day shall there be an altar to Jehovah in the midst of the land of Egypt, and a pillar at the border thereof 
to Jehovah; and it shall be for a sign and for a witness unto Jehovah Zebaoth in the land of Egypt; for they shall cry unto Jehovah because of the oppressors, and He shall send them a Saviour and 
a Prince, and He shall deliver them; and Jehovah shall be known to Egypt, and the Egyptians shall know Jehovah in that day; and they shall offer sacrifice and meat-offering, and shall vow a vow unto 
Jehovah, and shall perform it (Isa. 19:19-21). In the same: </p>
<p>     In that day there shall be a highway from Egypt to Asshur, and Asshur shall come into Egypt, and the Egyptians shall serve Asshur. In 
that day shall Israel be the third with Egypt and with Asshur, a blessing in the midst of the land, which Jehovah Zebaoth shall bless, saying, Blessed be Egypt My people, and Asshur the work of My hands, 
and Israel Mine inheritance (Isa. 19:23-25); </p>
<p>where the spiritual church is treated of, of which the spiritual is "Israel," the rational is "Asshur," and the faculty of knowing is "Egypt;" which 
three constitute the intellectual things of that church, which thus follow in order; on which account it is said, "In that day shall Israel be the third with Egypt and with Asshur," and "Blessed be Egypt 
My people, and Asshur the work of My hands, and Israel Mine inheritance." [14] In the same: </p>
<p>     It shall come to pass in that day that the great trumpet shall be blown, and they shall come which 
were ready to perish in the land of Asshur, and they that were outcasts in the land of Egypt, and they shall bow themselves down to Jehovah in the mountain of holiness at Jerusalem (Isa. 27:13). In 
the same: </p>
<p>     Thus saith Jehovah, The labor of Egypt, and the merchandise of Cush and of the Sabeans, men of stature, shall come over unto thee, and they shall be thine; they shall go after thee, 
and shall bow themselves down to thee, they shall make supplication unto thee. In thee only is God, and there is no God else besides (Isa. 45:14); </p>
<p>"Cush and the Sabeans" are knowledges (n. 117, 1171). 
In Zechariah: </p>
<p>     Egypt shall go up to Jerusalem, to worship the King Jehovah Zebaoth (Zech. 14:17-18). In Micah: </p>
<p>     I look unto Jehovah, I wait for the God of my salvation; my God will hear me; 
a day for building thy walls, in this day, and they shall come even unto thee thence from Asshur, and the cities of Egypt, and thence from Egypt even to the river (Micah 7:7, 11-12). [15] In Ezekiel: </p>
<p> 
    Thus saith the Lord Jehovih, At the end of forty years will I gather Egypt from the peoples whither they were scattered, and I will bring again the captivity of Egypt (Ezek. 29:13-14). In the 
same: </p>
<p>     Behold, Asshur was a cedar in Lebanon with fair branches and a shadowing forest, and lofty in height, and its branch was among the tangled boughs; the waters made it grow, going with her 
streams round about her plantation, and she sent out her canals unto all the trees of the field; therefore its height was exalted above all the trees of the field, and its boughs were multiplied, and 
its branches became long by reason of many waters; all the birds of the heavens made their nests in its boughs, and under its branches all the beasts of the field brought forth, and under its shadow 
dwelt all great nations. And it became fair in its greatness, in the length of its branches, for its root was by many waters; the cedars in the garden of God did not hide it, the firs were not like its 
boughs, nor was any tree in the garden of God like unto it in its beauty. I made it fair by the multitude of its branches, and all the trees of Eden that were in the garden of God, envied it (Ezek. 
31:3-8). The Most Ancient Church, which was celestial, is here described in regard to the quality of its rational, and thereby its wisdom and intelligence, because that church looked at things below 
from Divine things, thus at truths from goods themselves, and thence at things that are subordinate. "Asshur" and the "cedar" are the rational; the "tangled boughs among which were its branches" are 
memory-knowledges; the "rivers and waters" are spiritual goods, among which was its root; the "height and length of its branches" are its extension; the "garden of God" is the spiritual church; the "trees 
of Eden" are perceptions. From this and from all that goes before we can see what is the quality of man's rational, and what is the quality of his faculty of knowing, when they are subordinated to 
Divine truths, and serve them by confirming them. [16] That rational things and memory-knowledges are of service to those who are in the affirmative as means of being wise, was represented and signified 
by its being commanded the sons of Israel to borrow from the Egyptians vessels of gold, and vessels of silver, and garments (Exod. 3:22; 11:2; 12:35-36). The like is meant by its being said in various 
passages of the Word that they should possess the goods, houses, vineyards, and oliveyards, and other things, of the nations; and also that the very gold and silver taken from the nations should 
become holy. As in Isaiah: </p>
<p>     Jehovah will visit Tyre, and she shall return to her harlot hire, and shall commit whoredom with all the kingdoms of the earth upon the face of the ground, and her merchandise 
and her harlot hire shall be holiness to Jehovah; it shall not be stored up nor laid away, for to them that dwell before Jehovah her merchandise shall be for eating till satisfied, and for 
an ancient covering (Isa. 23:17-18); </p>
<p>"the merchandise of Tyre" denotes knowledges (n. 1201), which to those who are in the negative are as harlot hire; but to those who are in the affirmative are as 
what is holy. The like is also meant by the Lord's words: </p>
<p>     Make to yourselves friends by means of the mammon of unrighteousness, that when ye fail they may receive you into eternal habitations; if 
ye have not become faithful in the unrighteous mammon, who will intrust you with the true? (Luke 16:9, 11). </p>

'Abraham's wife' means, in order that spiritual truth might be joined to celestial good. This is clear from the representation of 'Sarah when a wife' as spiritual truth joined to celestial good, dealt 
with in <a href="1468.htm">1468</a>, <a href="1901.htm">1901</a>, <a href="2063.htm">2063</a>, <a href="2065.htm">2065</a>, <a href="2172.htm">2172</a>, <a href="2173.htm">2173</a>, <a href="2198.htm">2198</a>, <a href="2507.htm">2507</a>, and from the representation of 'Abraham' as celestial good joined to spiritual truth, dealt with in <a href="2010.htm">2010</a>, <a href="2172.htm">2172</a>, <a href="2198.htm">2198</a>, <a href="2501.htm">2501</a>. Whether you say spiritual 
truth and celestial good, or whether you say the Lord, it amounts to the same, for the Lord is truth itself and good itself, and also the marriage itself of truth and good and of good and truth. 
These matters may indeed be seen from the explanation given, yet as they belong among those things that are obscure at the present day, let them be illustrated so far as possible. The subject here 
is the doctrine of faith, about which doctrine the Lord thought when He was a boy; that is to say, He gave thought to whether it was permissible to enter into that doctrine by means of rational conceptions 
and in that way form ideas for Himself regarding it. This way of thinking was a product of His love and concern for the human race, who are such that they do not believe anything which is not grasped 
in a rational manner by them. But He perceived from the Divine that one ought not to enter into doctrine that way, and therefore He revealed such doctrine to Himself from the Divine and at the same 
time also all things in the universe that are subordinate to it, that is, all things of a rational kind, and all those of a natural kind. </p>
<p></p>
<p><b>[2]</b>
 People's attitudes to matters of doctrine regarding 
faith have been spoken of above in <a href="2568.htm">2568</a>. There it was stated that there are two basic attitudes of mind from which people think, the negative and the affirmative; also that they think from a negative 
attitude who believe nothing unless they are convinced by rational considerations and by facts, and indeed by sensory evidence, whereas those people think from an affirmative attitude who believe that 
things are true because the Lord has said so in the Word and who thus have faith in the Lord. People who adopt the negative attitude towards the truth of anything in the Word say in their hearts that 
they are willing to believe when persuaded on rational grounds and by facts. But these are such as never believe, not even indeed if they were convinced by means of the evidence of their own physical 
senses of seeing, hearing, and touch; for they would always be producing new reasonings against such things, and in so doing they would at length completely destroy all faith and at the same time would 
turn the light of the rational into darkness, because they would turn it into falsities. People however who adopt the affirmative attitude, that is, who believe that things are true because the Lord 
has said so, are being confirmed all the time by rational considerations and by facts, and even by sensory evidence, and their ideas are being enlightened and are strengthened by these; for light comes 
to man through no other channel than the rational ideas and the factual knowledge which he possesses. This is so with everyone. With those who have the affirmative attitude of mind doctrine is certainly 
living, and of them it is said that they are healed and give birth. But with those who have the negative attitude doctrine certainly dies, and of them it is said that the womb is completely closed. 
All this shows what it is to enter the doctrine of faith by means of rational ideas, and what it is to enter into rational ideas from the doctrine of faith. </p>
<p></p>
<p><b>[3]</b>
 Let these differences be illustrated 
by examples: The Word teaches that the first and foremost matter of doctrine is love to the Lord and charity towards the neighbour. People with the affirmative attitude towards this are able to 
enter into whatever things of a rational, factual, and indeed sensory kind they please, each according to his ability, knowledge, and experience. Indeed the more they do so the more they are confirmed, 
for the whole natural order is full of what is confirmatory. But people who deny this first and foremost teaching, and who wish first of all to be convinced by means of factual and rational considerations 
that a thing is true, never allow themselves to be convinced because they deny in their hearts and are all the time taking their stand on some other basic idea which they believe to be essential. 
In the end through confirmations of that idea these people so blind themselves that they cannot even know what love to the Lord is and what love towards the neighbour is. And because they confirm 
themselves in notions contrary to such love they at length also confirm themselves in the idea that no other kind of love can exist that has any delight in it except self-love and love of the world. And 
this they do to such an extent - if not in doctrine yet in the lives they lead - that they embrace hellish love in place of heavenly love. </p>
<p></p>
<p><b>[4]</b>
 But with those who as yet have adopted neither a negative 
attitude nor an affirmative one but are in a state of doubt that precedes either of these, the position has been stated above in <a href="2568.htm">2568</a>. There it was shown that those who incline towards a life of 
evil fall into the negative attitude, whereas those who incline towards a life good are brought into the affirmative one. Take a different example: One of the leading ideas of the doctrine of faith 
is that all good comes from the Lord and all evil from man or self. People with the affirmative attitude that this is so are able to confirm themselves by many rational ideas, and by facts, such as that 
no good can possibly flow in except from Good itself, that is, from the fountain of good, and so from the Lord, and that good cannot have its first beginnings anywhere else. Such people find these 
ideas enlightened for them by all things which are truly good within themselves, within others, within society in general, and indeed within the whole of creation. But people with the negative attitude 
confirm themselves by everything they can possibly think of in ideas to the contrary, so much so that at length they do not know what good is. And disputing among themselves as to what the highest good 
is, they are profoundly ignorant of the fact that it is by means of celestial and spiritual good from the Lord that every type of good beneath it is made living, and that the delight flowing from 
it is truly delight. Some also imagine that if good does not come from themselves it cannot possibly come from any other source. </p>
<p></p>
<p><b>[5]</b>
 Take another example: Those who are governed by love to the Lord 
and charity towards the neighbour are able to receive the truths of doctrine and to have faith in the Word, but not so those leading a life of self-love and love of the world. Or what amounts to the 
same, those governed by good are able to believe but not those governed by evil. People with the affirmative attitude of mind are able to confirm this in countless ways - with rational ideas and factual 
knowledge. With rational ideas they are able to confirm that truth is compatible with good but not with evil, and that as all falsity resides in evil it is also the product of evil, and that if any 
people governed by evil nevertheless possess any truth, this is on their lips, not in their heart. And with factual knowledge they are able to confirm from many points of view that truths put evils to 
flight and that evils detest truths. But people with the negative attitude confirm themselves in the idea that everyone, irrespective of what he is like in character - even if he leads a life for ever 
hating, taking delight in revenge, and practicing deceit - is able to believe as others are able to do so. Yet while holding to this idea they themselves totally reject goodness of life from doctrine, 
and having rejected it believe nothing whatever. </p>
<p></p>
<p><b>[6]</b>
 To make the matter plainer still, take yet another example: Those who adopt the affirmative attitude that the Word has been written in such 
a way as to have an internal sense that is not apparent in the letter are also able in many ways to confirm themselves through rational considerations, such as the following, </p>
<p>By means of the Word man 
has a link with heaven. </p>
<p>Correspondences exist of natural things with spiritual, though the spiritual are not very apparent. </p>
<p>The ideas which belong to interior thought are completely different 
from the material ideas which fall into the words of spoken language. While man is in the world he is able to be in heaven (for he has been born for life in both places) through the Word which is intended 
for both places. </p>
<p>With some people a certain Divine light flows into the things of the understanding and into the affections when the Word is being read. </p>
<p>It is necessary that something be written 
which has come down from heaven and thus that the nature of its existence in its origins cannot be the same as its existence in the letter. </p>
<p>It cannot be holy except from a certain holiness which 
it has within it. </p>
<p>A person with the affirmative attitude is also able to confirm himself by means of certain facts, such as the following, </p>
<p>In former times people were living in an age of representatives. 
The writings of the Ancient Church contained such representatives, and those of many authors among the gentiles were composed of them, so that in the Churches that style of writing was 
regarded as being holy, and among the gentiles as being learned (books by many of those authors could also be mentioned). </p>
<p>But people who adopt the negative attitude, though they do not deny all these 
considerations and facts, nevertheless do not believe them. They persuade themselves that the Word is such as it exists in the letter, where indeed it presents a worldly appearance, but is nevertheless 
spiritual. They do not have any interest however in where that spiritual element lies, but for a multitude of reasons still want it. And that of which they are persuaded they are able to confirm 
in many ways. </p>
<p></p>
<p><b>[7]</b>
 To present this matter in a way that can be grasped by ordinary people, let the following known fact serve as an example: Those with the affirmative attitude that sight does not belong 
to the eye but to the spirit which sees objects in the world by means of the eye as an organ of its own body can find confirmation of this fact in many ways. For instance, those people may find 
confirmation of it in their hearing of words spoken by another, in that these spoken words ally themselves to a certain interior sight, into which those words are converted - something that could not 
possibly occur but for the existence of that interior sight. These people may also find confirmation of the same in the consideration that whatever they think about is seen with an interior sight, by 
some more clearly and by others more obscurely, as well as in the consideration that the things produced by their imagination are not unlike actual objects of sight. They may find a further confirmation 
in the consideration that unless it were the spirit within the body that saw the things taken in by the eye as the organ of sight, the spirit would be unable to see anything in the next life, when 
in fact it is destined to behold countless and astonishing sights which the eye of the body cannot possibly see. In addition confirmation may be found by these people by reflecting on how in dreams, especially 
those of the prophets, many things have likewise been seen, yet not with the eyes. Finally, if trained in philosophy, a person may find confirmation in the consideration that things which are 
more exterior cannot enter into those that are more interior, just as that which is compound cannot enter into that which is simple, so that things of the body cannot enter into those of the spirit; 
only the reverse is possible. Besides these many other confirmations might be introduced, till at length a person is persuaded that sight belongs to the spirit, and not to the eye except from the spirit. 
But people with the negative attitude either speak of everything of this kind as that which is natural and physical, or else they speak of it as that which is imaginary. And when they are told that 
a spirit possesses and enjoys far more perfect sight than man does in the body, they laugh at the idea and dismiss it as nonsense, for they believe that they will be living in darkness when they are 
deprived of the sight of the eye. But in fact quite the reverse is the case in that they then dwell in the light. </p>
<p></p>
<p><b>[8]</b>
 These examples show what it is to enter into things of a rational and factual 
nature from truths, and what it is to enter into truths from things of a factual and rational nature. The first method of approach is according to order, but the second is contrary to it; and when a 
person acts according to order he is enlightened, but when he acts contrary to order he is made blind. This makes plain how important it is for people to know and believe truths, for truths enlighten 
man, but falsities make him blind. Truths open up to the rational a vast and practically unlimited field, whereas falsities provide scarcely any such opening up at all, though this is not very evident. 
The reason why angels have so much wisdom is that they are enveloped in truths, truth being the light itself of heaven. </p>
<p></p>
<p><b>[9]</b>
 Those who have made themselves blind through refusing to believe anything 
which they do not perceive with the physical senses, till at length they have no belief at all, were in former times called 'serpents belonging to the tree of knowledge'. For they reasoned much from 
things as perceived by the senses and from the resulting illusions which man accepts and believes all too easily, and by such reasoning they led very many astray, see <a href="195.htm">195</a>, <a href="196.htm">196</a>. In the next life they 
are easily distinguished from other spirits by the fact that in everything which is a matter of faith they reason whether it is so. And if it is demonstrated to them a thousand times, and then another 
thousand, that it is so they still advance doubts of a negative kind against every confirmation that is offered, and this they would go on doing for ever. They are so blinded therefore that they are 
lacking in common sense, that is, they are unable to grasp what good and truth are. Yet every one of them imagines that he is wiser than anyone else in the whole universe, making wisdom consist in being 
able to dispose of what is Divine and to derive the origin of things from what is natural. Many who have been considered wise men in the world are pre- eminently such as these; for the more anyone 
with the negative attitude of mind possesses talent and knowledge, the more insane he is, more so than all others. But the more anyone with the affirmative attitude possesses talent and knowledge the 
wiser he is able to become. One is not by any means forbidden to develop the rational by means of factual knowledge, but one is not allowed to use it to harden oneself against the truths of faith which 
belong to the Word. </p>

<p><b>[10]</b>
 Much concerning these matters occurs in the internal sense of the Word, especially in prophetical sections, where the subject is Asshur and Egypt, for 'Asshur' means reasoning, <a href="119.htm">119</a>, <a href="1186.htm">1186</a>, and 'Egypt' knowledge, <a href="1164.htm">1164</a>, <a href="1165.htm">1165</a>, <a href="1186.htm">1186</a>, <a href="1462.htm">1462</a>. </p>

and the river will be parched and dry; and the streams will depart, and the rivers of Egypt will diminish and become parched. Reed and rush will wither away. Every seed of the river will be dry. Jehovah

 In all these places 'Asshur' means reasoning, as has been shown, 'Egypt' and 'pharaoh' mean knowledge, and 'Ephraim' 
the understanding part of the mind. These and many other places elsewhere describe what man's rational comes to be like when he reasons about the truths of faith from the negative attitude of mind. 
Similar teaching is embodied in the incidents recorded in Isaiah <a href="36.htm">36</a> and <a href="37.htm">37</a>, when the Rabshakeh was sent from the king of Asshur and spoke out against Jerusalem and king Hezekiah, and the angel of 
Jehovah at that time struck down in the camp of the king of Asshur one hundred and eighty-five thousands. Those descriptions mean the disarray into which all that constitutes man's rationality is thrown 
when he reasons against Divine things, however much he may seem to himself at that time to be wise. </p>

 Such reasoning is also referred to in various places as 'whoredom committed with the sons

<p>Here the Most Ancient Church, which was celestial, is described as to the nature of its rational 
and so of its wisdom and intelligence, for that Church used to look at things below from those which were Divine. Thus it looked at truths from goods themselves, and then from truths at what was 
subsidiary to these. By 'Asshur' and 'a cedar' are meant the rational, by 'entangled boughs among which were its branches' is meant factual knowledge, by 'streams' and 'waters' are meant spiritual 
goods, among which was its 'root', by 'the height and the length of the branches' the extent of it, by 'the garden of God' the spiritual Church, and by 'the trees of Eden' perceptions. This and the other

will visit Tyre, and she will return to hiring herself out as a harlot, and will commit whoredom with all the kingdoms of the earth on the face of the ground. And its merchandise and 
its harlot's hire will become holy to Jehovah; it will not be stored or hoarded, for its merchandise will be for them that dwell before Jehovah to eat to satisfaction and for ancient clothing. <a href="http://bible.gospelcom.net/cgi-bin/bible?passage=Isa%2023:&amp;version=ESV&amp;interface=print&amp;showfn=yes&amp;showxref">Isa 23:</a>

</blockquote>
<p>'The merchandise of Tyre' stands for cognitions, <a href="1201.htm">1201</a>, which to those with the negative attitude of mind are like 'a harlot's hire' but to those with the affirmative attitude are like that 
which is holy. Something similar is also meant by the Lord's words, </p>
<blockquote>
Make friends for yourselves out of the mammon of unrighteousness, so that when you fail they may receive you into eternal habitations. 
If then you have not appeared faithful in the unrighteous mammon, who will entrust to you the true? <a href="http://bible.gospelcom.net/cgi-bin/bible?passage=Luke%2016:-9,%2011&amp;version=ESV&amp;interface=print&amp;showfn=yes&amp;showxref">Luke 16:-9, 11</a>.

`Uxoris Abrahami': quod significet ut verum spirituale conjungeretur bono caelesti, constat a repraesentatione `Sarae ut uxoris' quod sit verum spirituale conjunctum bono caelesti, de qua n. 1468, 1901, 
2063, 2065, 2172, 2173, 2198, 2507, et a repraesentatione `Abrahami,' quod sit bonum caeleste conjunctum vero spirituali, de qua n. (x)2010, 2172, 2198, 2501 sive dicas verum spirituale et bonum 
caeleste, sive Dominum, idem est, quia Dominus est ipsum verum et ipsum bonum, ac ipsum conjugium veri et boni ac boni et veri.  Quomodo haec se habent, constare quidem potest ab explicatione sed quia 
inter obscura sunt quae hodie, licet quantum fieri potest illa illustrare: de doctrina fidei hic agitur, de qua Dominus in pueritia cogitavit, scilicet num liceret in nam intrare per rationalia, et sic 
Sibi de illa ideas formare; quod hoc cogitatum, erat ex amore consulendi generi humano, quod tale est ut quod non rationali modo capit, non credat; sed percepit ex Divino quod hoc non fieri deberet, 
quare ex Divino illam Sibi {1} revelavit, et tunc inde etiam omnia in universo quae subjecta sunt, nempe quae rationalium, et quae naturalium.  [2] Quomodo se habet cum doctrinalibus fidei apud homines 
supra n. 2568 dictum est, nempe quod duo principia sint, ex quibus cogitant, negativum et affirmativum; quodque ex principio negativo illi qui nihil credunt nisi convincantur per rationalia et scientifica, 
immo per sensualia; et quod ex affirmativo illi qui credunt quod vera sint quia Dominus dixit in Verbo, ita qui fidem habent Domino.  Qui in negativo sunt quod verum sit quod in Verbo, dicentes 
corde quo tunc credere velint cum per rationalia et scientifica persuadentur, cum iis ita est quod nunquam credant, immo nec si per ipsa sensuali corporis, ut per visum et auditum et per tactum, convincerentur, 
semper enim nova ratiocinia formarent contra illa, ita tandem exstinguendo prorsus omnem fidem, ac simul lucem rationalis vertendo in tenebras, quia in falsa.  Qui autem in affirmativo 
sunt, hoc est, qui credunt quod vera sint quia Dominus ita dixit, cum illis ita est quod per rationalia et scientifica, etiam per sensualia, jugiter confirmentur, ac ideae eorum illustrentur et corroborentur; 
nam homo non aliunde habet lucem quam per rationalia et scientifica {2}, quisque etiam hoc facit; apud hos doctrina sic vivendo vivit, et de iis dicitur quod sanentur et pariant; apud illos autem 
doctrina moriendo moritur, et de illis dicitur quod claudendo claudatur uterus.  Ex his patet quid sit per rationalia intrare in doctrinam fidei, et quid ex doctrina fidei intrare in rationalia. 
 [3] Sed {3} haec per exempla illustrentur: Ex doctrina {4} Verbi est quod primum et principale doctrinae sit amor in Dominum et charitas erga proximum; illi qui in affirmativo in hoc sunt, possunt intrare 
in quaecumque libet rationalia, et scientifica, immo sensualia, quisque secundum suam dotem, suam scientiam, et suam experientiam {5}, immo quo plus intrant, eo plus confirmantur, nam universa natura 
confirmationis plena est: at qui hoc primum et principale doctrinae negant, et volunt prius convinci quod ita sit, per scientifica et rationalia, ii nusquam, quia negant corde, se patiuntur convinci, 
et continue pro alio principio quod essentiale credunt, stant; ac iidem demum per confirmationes sua principii tandem ita se occaecant ut ne quidem scire possint quid amor in Dominum et quid amor 
erga proximum; et quia se confirmant in contrariis, etiam tandem in eo quod non alius amor dari queat in quo jucundum, quam sui et mundi, et hoc eousque, si non doctrina, usque vita, amorem infernalem 
amplectantur loco amoris caelestis: [4] (m)cum illis autem qui non in negativo, nec in affirmativo sunt, sed in dubitativo antequam negant vel affirmant, se habet ut supra n. (x)2568 dictam, nempe 
quod qui ad vitam mali inclinant, in negativum cadant, qui autem ad vitam boni, in affirmativum ferantur.(n)  Sit etiam pro exemplo; inter primaria doctrinae fidei est quod omne bonum a Domino, et omne 
malum ab homine seu a seipso; qui in affirmativo sunt quod ita sit, ii confirmare se possunt per multa quae rationalia sunt {6} et scientifica, ut quod nusquam aliquod bonum influere possit quam ab 
Ipso Bono, hoc est, a fonte boni, ita a Domino; quodque principium boni non aliunde esse possit, illustrando se per omnia quae in se, in aliis, in communi, immo in universo creato, vere bona sunt; at 
qui in negativo sunt, ii in contrariis, per omnia quae usquam cogitant, se confirmant, usque adeo tandem ut non sciant quid bonum, inter se disceptando quid summum, alte ignorando quod bonum caeleste 
et spirituale quod a Domino, sit per quod vivificatur omne bonum quod infra est, et quod inde jucundum vere jucundum sit; quidam etiam, quod nisi a se bonum, nusquam possit aliunde.  [5] Sit iterum pro 
exemplo, quod qui in amoris in Dominum et charitate erga proximum sunt, possint vera doctrinae recipere, et fidem habere Verbo, non autem qui in vita amoris sui et mundi sunt, seu quod idem, quod qui 
in bono sunt: possint credere, non autem qui in malo; qui in affirmativo sunt, hoc possunt innumeris rationaliter et scientifice confirmare; rationaliter quod verum et bonum concordent, non autem verum 
et malum, et quod sicut in malo, etiam ex malo, omne falsum sit, et si aliquibus usque verum, quod sit in labiis non in corde; scientifice ex multis, quod vera fugiant mala, et quod mala respuant 
vera: qui autem in negativo sunt, se confirmant in eo quod unusquisque qualiscumque sit, tametsi in continuo odio, in vindictae jucundis, ac in dolis, vivit possit sicut alii credere, et hoc usque dum 
bonum vitae prorsus e doctrina rejiciant, quo rejecto non credunt quicquam.  [6] Ut adhuc pateat quomodo se habet, sit exemplum; qui in affirmativo sunt quod Verbum ita scriptum sit ut sensum internum 
habeat qui non apparet in littera ii possunt multis se etiam per rationalia confirmare; ut quod per Verbum nexus homini cum caelo: quod correspondentiae dentur naturalium cum spiritualibus et quod haec 
non ita appareant: quod ideae interioris cogitationis prorsus aliae sint quam ideae materiale: quae cadunt in voces linguae: quod {7} homo dum {8} in mundo, etiam in caelo possit esse, quia natus 
ad utramque vitam, per {9} Verbum quod pro utroque: quod lux quaedam Divina influat apud quosdam in intellectualia et in affectiones, cum legitur Verbum: quod necessum sit ut aliquod scriptum sit, quod 
descenderit e caelo, et sic quod illuc non tale possit esse in sua origine quale in littera; quod sanctum non possit esse nisi a sanctitate quadam quae intus; etiam potest per scientifica se confirmare, 
ut quod olim fuerint in repraesentativis et quod Antiquae Ecclesiae scripta talia fuerint: etiam quod inde quoque scripta plurium inter gentes: et quod stilus inde veneratus sit ut sanctus in Ecclesiis, 
ac ut doctus apud gentes: plurium etiam libri possunt memorari; at qui in negativo sunt, haec omnia si non negant, usque non credunt; et sibi persuadent {10} quod Verbum sit quale in littera, 
apparens quidem mundanum, sed usque quod spirituale sit; ubi autem spirituale latet, non curant, at volunt ex multiplici causa; et hoc confirmare possunt multis.  [7] Ut ad captum simplicium etiam sistatur, 
sit etiam {11} scientificum pro exemplo: qui in affirmativo sunt quod visus non sit oculi sed quod sit spiritus qui per oculum, ut per sui corporis organum, videt illa quae in mundo sunt; ii se 
confirmare possunt multis, ut ex loquelis quae audiuntur, quod se referant ad visum quendam interiorem, et in illum transmutentur, quod fieri nequiret nisi visus interior esset: tum quicquid cogitatur, 
hoc videatur visu interiore, a quibusdam clarius et a quibusdam obscurius; praeter quod imaginativa se sistant visualibus non absimilia; ut et, nisi spiritus qui in corpore, videat id quod oculus ut 
organum haurit, quod spiritus in altera vita nihil potuisset videre, cum tamen non aliter esse possit quam is visurus innumerabilia et stupenda, quae oculus corporis nusquam potest: praeterea reflectere 
potest super somnia, imprimis prophetarum, in quibus aeque plura visa sunt, et hoc non per oculos: demum si philosophica sapiat, per hoc quod exteriora non intrare possint in interiora, ut composita 
non in simplicia, ita non illa quae sunt corporis, in (c)illa quae sunt spiritus, sed vicissim: praeter perplura alia, ut tandem persuasus sit quod spiritui sit visus, non oculo nisi a spiritu; at 
qui in negativo sunt, haec omnia vel dicunt naturalia, vel phantasias; et cum eis dicitur quod spiritus multo perfectiore visu polleat et fruatur quam homo in corpore, irrident {12} et inter {13} nugas 
rejiciunt, credentes quod tunc in tenebris victuri cum privantur visu oculi, cum prorsus contrarium sit, quod tunc in luce.  [8] Ab his exemplis patet quid sit a veris intrare in rationalia et scientifica, 
et quid a scientificis et rationalibus in vera, quod nempe illud sit secundum ordinem, hoc autem contra ordinem; et cum fit secundum ordinem, quod illustretur homo, cum autem fit contra ordinem, 
quod occaecetur; (m)inde liquet {14} quantum interest ut vera sciantur et credantur, a veris enim illustratur homo, a falsis autem occaecatur; a veris patet campus rationali immensus et fere illimitatus, 
a falsis autem, tametsi non ita apparet, paene nullus respective; inde sapientia tanta angelis, quia in veris sunt, verum enim est ipsa lux caeli.(n)  [9] Qui se occaecarunt per id quod nihil 
credere voluerint quod non sensibus caperent, usque tandem ut nihil crediderint, olim dicti sunt `serpentes arboris scientiae,' ex sensualibus enim et inde fallaciis quae facile cadunt in captum et fidem 
hominis, multum ratiocinati sunt, et plures seduxerunt videatur n. 195, 196: in altera vita internoscuntur facile ab alii spiritibus, ex eo quod de omnibus quae sunt fidei, ratiocinentur num ita sit, 
quibus si millies et millies ostenditur quod ita sit, usque contra unumquodvis confirmans movent dubia negativa, et hoc si foret in aeternum; sunt ideo occaecati usque adeo ut non iis sensus communis 
hoc est, capere possint quid bonum et verum; et tamen unusquisque eorum putat quod prae omnibus in universo sapiat, in eo ponentes sapientium ut quod Divinum est, possint infringere, et deducere naturali; 
multi qui fuerunt aestimati ut sapientes in mundo, prae alii tales sunt; quo plus enim aliquis ingenii dote et scientia pollet et in negativo est, eo plus reliquis insanit; at quo plus enim ingenii 
dote et scientia pollet et in affirmativo est, eo plus sapere potest: {15} rationale per scientias excolere, nusquam negatum est; sed vetitum {16} obfirmare se contra vera fidei quae sunt Verbi. 
 [10] De his multum agitur in sensi interno Verbi imprimis prophetici, ubi agitur de Asshure et Aegypto per `Asshurem' enim significatur ratiocinatio, n. 119, 1186, et per `Aegyptum' scientia, n. 1164, 
1165, 1186, 1462. De iis qui per scientifica et rationalia intrare volunt in doctrinalia fidei et Divina, ac inde insaniunt, ita apud Esaiam, 	Confundam Aegyptum in Aegypto, et pugnabunt vir contra 
fratrem suum, et vir contra socium suum, urbs contra urbem, et regnum contra regnum: et exhaurietur spiritus Aegypti in medio ejus, et consilium ejus absorbebo:... deficient aquae mari, et fluvius 
exsiccabitur et exarescet; et recedent flumina, comminuentur et exsiccabuntur fluvii Aegypti; calamus et ulva marcescent;... omne semen fluminis exarescet.... Jehovah commiscuit in medio ejus spiritum 
perversitatum, et errare fecerunt Aegyptum in omni opere ejus, secundum errare ebrium in vomitu suo, xix 2, 3, 5-7, 	14: </p>
<p>apud eundem, 	Vae filiis refractariis,... qui abeunt ad descendendum in Aegyptum, 
sed os meum non interrogarunt, ad roborandum se robore Pharaonis, et ad confidendum in umbra Aegypti: et erit vobis robur Pharaonis in pudorem, et fiducia in umbra Aegypti in ignominiam, xxx 1-3: </p>
<p>apud 
eundem, 	Vae descendentibus in Aegyptum pro auxilio, et super equis innituntur, et confidunt super curru quod multus,... sed non respiciunt ad Sanctum Israelis, et Jehovam non quaerunt.... Et 
Jehovah extendet manum Suam, impinget auxilians, et cadet adjutus, et simul omnes illi consumuntur {17}:... et cadet Asshur gladio non viri, et gladius non hominis comedet eum, xxxi 1, 3, 8: </p>
<p>apud Jeremiam, 	Duo 
mala fecit populus Meus, Me deseruerunt, fontem aquarum vivarum, ad excidendum sibi foveas, foveas fractas, quae non continent aquas. Nonne servus Israel, si natus domus ille, quare factus 
est in praedam?... Annon hoc facis tibi, deserendo te Jehovam Deum tuum, tempore cum ducit {18} te in viam? et nunc quid tibi cum via Aegypti ad bibendum aquas Shihoris, aut quid tibi cum via Asshuris 
ad bibendum aquas fluvii?... O generatio, vos videte Verbum Jehovae, num desertum fui Israeli? num terra tenebrarum? quare dixerunt populus Meus, Dominabimur, non veniemus ultra ad Te?... Cur 	abis 
strenue {19} ad mutandum viam tuam? etiam ab Aegypto 	pudefies, sicut pudefacta es ab Asshure, ii 13, 14, 17, 18, 31, 36: </p>
<p>(s)apud eundem, 	Audite verbum Jehovae, reliquiae Jehudae, sic dixit Jehovah 
Zebaoth, Deus Israelis, Si vos ponendo posueritis facies vestras ad veniendum in Aegyptum, et veneritis ad peregrinandum ibi; et erit, gladius, a quo vos timentes vobis, ibi prehendet vos in terra 
Aegypti, et fames de qua vos verentes, ibi adhaerebit vobis in {20} Aegypto, ut ibi moriamini: et erunt omnes viri, qui posuerunt facies suas ad veniendum in Aegyptum, ad peregrinandum ibi, morientur 
gladio, fame (c)et peste, et non erit illis superstes aut evadens, a coram malo, quod Ego adducens super vos, xlii 15-17, seq.:(s) apud Ezechielem, 	Et cognoscant omnes habitatores Aegypti, quod Ego 
Jehovah; propterea quod illi fuerunt baculus arundinis domui Israelis, in prehendendo te illum in vola, confringeris, et findes illis omnem humerum, et in innitendo vos super te, frangeris, et stare 
facies eis omnes lumbos: propterea sic dixit Dominus Jehovih, Ecce Ego adducens super te gladium, et exscindere faciam ex te hominem et bestiam, et erit terra Aegypti, in desolationem et vastitatem, et 
scient quod Ego Jehovah, propterea quod dixit, Fluvius mihi, et ego feci, xxix 6-9, seq.: </p>
<p>apud Hosheam, 	Fuit Ephraim sicut columba stulta, {21} Aegyptum 	invocabant, Asshur abiverunt; cum ibunt, 
expandam super eos rete Meum;... vae illis, quia divagati sunt a Me, vii 11-13: </p>
<p>(s)apud eundem, 	Ephraim pascens ventum, et persequens eurum; omni die mendacium, et vastationem multiplicat, et foedus 
cum Asshure 	pangunt, et oleum in Aegyptum defertur, xii 2:(s) apud eundem, 	Israel scortatus est sub deo suo, dilexisti quaestum super omnibus areis frumenti:... revertetur Ephraim in Aegyptum, et 
in Asshur immundum comedent;... quia ecce abiverunt prae devastatione, Aegyptus congregabit eos, Moph sepeliet eos desiderabile argento eorum spina possidebit, carduus in tentoriis eorum:  percussus 
est Ephraim, radix 	eorum exaruit, fructu non facient; etiam cum genuerint, et interficiam desideria ventris eorum, rejiciet eos Deus meus, quia non audiverunt Ipsum, erunt vagi inter gentes, ix 1, 3, 
6, 16, 17: </p>
<p>apud Esaiam, 	Vae Asshur, virga irae Meae, et baculus is, in manu eorum, indignationis Meae,... ille non rectum cogitat {22}, et cor ejus non rectum meditatur, quia ad perdendum in corde 
ejus, et exscindendum gentes non paucas, siquidem dicit, 	Nonne principes mei simul reges?  Visitabo super fructum elationis cordis regis Asshuris,... quia dixit, In robore manus meae feci, et in sapientia 
mea, quia intelligens sum, et removebo terminos populorum, thesauros eorum depraedabor, ac dejiciam, ut potens, habitatores:... propterea mittet 		Dominus dominorum {23} Zebaoth in pingues ejus 
maciem, et 	loco gloriae ejus incendendo incendetur incendium ignis, x 	5, 7, 8, 12, 13, 16. [11]	In his omnibus locis, per `Asshurem,' ut ostensum, significatur ratiocinatio; per `Aegyptum et Pharaonem' 
scientia; per `Ephraimum intellectuale; et describitur ibi et pluries alibi, quale fit rationale hominis, cum ex negativo ratiocinatur de veris fidei: simile involvit cum Rabshakeh missus a rege 
Asshuris locutus contra Hierosolymam et Hizkiam regem, quod angelus Jehovae in castris regis Asshuris tunc percusserit centum et octoginta et quinque millia, de quibus apud Esaiam xxxvi et xxxvii, quibus 
significatur qualis strages rationalium hominis fit, cum contra Divina ratiocinatur, utcumque homo sibi apparet quod tunc sapiens sit.  [12] Ratiocinatio haec vocatur etiam passim `scortatio cum 
filiis Aegypti et cum filiis Asshuris,' ut (s)apud Ezechielem, 	Scortata es cum filiis Aegypti, vicinis tuis, magnis 	carne, et multiplicasti scortationem tuam,... et scortata es cum filiis Asshuris, 
absque ut satiata sis, xvi 26, 28; xxiii 3, 5-21; </p>
<p>videatur n. 2466.  [13] De iis autem qui ex doctrina fidei intrant in rationalia et scientifica, et inde sapiunt; {24} apud Esaiam, 	In die illo erit 
altare Jehovae in medio terrae Aegypti, et statua juxta terminum ejus Jehovae, et erit in signum et in testem Jehovae Zebaoth in terra Aegypti; nam clamabunt ad Jehovam propter oppressores, et mittet 
illis servatorem et principem, et liberabit eos, et notus fiet 	Jehovah Aegypto, et cognoscent Aegyptii Jehovam in die illo, 	et facient sacrificium et minham, et vovebunt votum Jehovae, 	et reddent, 
xix 18-21: </p>
<p>{25} apud eundem, 	In die illo erit semita ab Aegypto ad Asshurem, et veniet Asshur in Aegyptum,... et servient Aegyptii Asshuri; in die illo erit Israel tertius Aegypto et Asshuri, benedictio 
in medio terrae, cui benedicet Jehovah Zebaoth, dicendo, Benedictus populus Meus Aegyptus, et opus manuum Mearum Asshur, et hereditas Mea Israel, xix 23-25; </p>
<p>ubi de Ecclesia spirituali, cujus 
spirituale est `Israel,' rationale est `Asshur,' et scientificum est `Aegyptus,' quae tria constituunt Ecclesiae illius intellectualia, quae ita succedunt, quare dicitur `in die illo erit Israel tertius 
Aegypto et Asshuri,' et `benedictus populus Meus Aegyptus, opus manuum Mearum Asshur, et hereditas Mea Israel': [14] apud eundem, 	Erit in die illo clangetur in buccina magna, et venient pereuntes 
in terra Asshuris, et expulsi in terra Aegypti, et incurvabunt se Jehovae in monte sanctitatis, in Hierosolyma, xxvii 13: </p>
<p>apud eundem, 	Sic dixit Jehovah, Labor Aegypti, et merces Cushi et Sabaeorum, 
virorum mensurae, apud te transibunt, et tibi erunt; post te ibunt,... et ad te incurvabunt se, ad te orabunt, tantummodo in te Deus, et nullus alius praeterea Deus, xlv 14; </p>
<p>`Cush et Sabaei' sunt 
cognitiones, n. 117, 1171: apud Zachariam, 	Aegyptus ascendet Hierosolymam, ad adorandum Regem Jehovam Zebaoth, xiv 17, 18: </p>
<p>apud Micham, 	Ego in Jehovam respicio, exspecto Deum salutis meae, audiet 
me Deus meus,... dies ad aedificandum macerias tuas, dies hic,... et usque ad te venient inde ab Asshure, et urbes Aegypti, et inde ab Aegypto usque ad fluvium, vii 7, 	11, 12: </p>
<p>[15] (m)apud Ezechielem, 	Sic 
dixit Dominus Jehovih, A fine quadraginta annorum congregabo Aegyptum ex populis, quo dispersi fuerunt, et reducam captivitatem Aegypti, xxix 13, 14:(n) apud eundem, 	Ecce Asshur cedrus 
in Libano, pulchra ramo, et silva 	umbrosa, et excelsa altitudine, et inter implexa fuit ramus 	ejus; aquae crescere fecerunt eam,... cum fluviis suis 	vadens circum plantationem ejus, et aquaeductus 
suos emisit ad omnes arbores agri propterea alta facta est altitudo ejus prae omnibus arboribus aquis et multiplicati sunt rami ejus, et longi facti rami ejus ab aquis multis:... in ramis ejus nidificarunt 
omnis avis caelorum, et si ramis ejus pepererunt omnis fera agri, et in umbra ejus habitarunt omnes gentes magnae; et pulchra facta est in magnitudine sua, longitudine ramorum suorum, quia fuit 
radix ejus apud aquas multas: cedri non occultarunt eam in horto Dei; abietes non pares fuerunt ramis ejus,... omnis arbor in horto Dei non par fuit illi in pulchritudine ejus: pulchram feci eam in multitudine 
ramorum ejus, et aemulatae sunt ei omnes arbores Eden, quae horto Dei, xxxi 39; </p>
<p>describitur hic Ecclesia Antiquissima quae caelestis, quale ejus rationale fuit, et sic {26} sapientia et intelligentia, 
quia Ecclesia illa ex Divinis illa quae infra erant, intuebatur, ita ex ipsis bonis vera, et inde quae subjecta sunt; `Asshur' et `cedrus' est rationale: `implexa inter quae rami' sunt scientifica: 
`(o)fluvii et aquae' sunt bona spiritualia, apud quae `radix': `altitudo et longitudo ramorum' (o)est extensio ejus; `hortus Dei' (o)est Ecclesia spiritualis; `arbores Eden' (o)sunt perceptiones: 
inde et ex superioribus patet quale est rationale et quale scientificum hominis, cum subordinantur veris Divinis, et inserviunt illis confirmando.  Quod rationalia et scientifica inserviant illis 
qui et affirmativo sunt, pro mediis sapiendi, repraesentatum et significatum est per quod mandatum filiis Israelis, ut `mutuo peterent ab Aegyptii vasa auri {27}, et vasa argenti {27}, et vestes,' Exod. 
iii 22; xi 2; xii 35, 36 similiter per quod passim in Verbo dicatur quod gentium bona, domos, vineas, (o)et oliveta, et plura possiderent; ut et quod ipsum aurum et argentum, quod ereptum gentibus, 
sanctum fieret, ut apud Esaiam, 	Visitabit Jehovah Tyrum, et redibit ad quaestum meretricium suum, et scortabitur cum omnibus regnis terrae super faciebus humi; et fiet mercatura ejus, et quaestus 
meretricius ejus sanctum Jehovae, non recondetur et non reponetur, quia habitantibus coram Jehovah erit mercatura ejus ad comedendum ad satietatem, et ad tegumentum antiquum, xxiii 17, 18; </p>
<p>`mercatura 
Tyri' pro cognitionibus, n. 1201, quae illis qui in negativo, pro `quaestu meretricio,' at illis qui in affirmativo, pro `sancto.' Simile etiam intelligitur per Domini verba, 	Facite vobis amicos ex 
mammona injustitiae, ut quando defeceritis, suscipiant vos in aeterna habitacula:... si in injusto mammona fideles non existitis, quis verum vobis 	concredet? Luc. xvi 9, 11. 	@1 A has Sibi illam;
