<h3 align="center" class="ired">属天的奥秘 第2088节</h3>
<h4 align="center"></h4><p><strong>2088.</strong>“看哪，我必赐福给他，使他繁殖，极其繁多”表他们将被充满和赐予信之良善和源于此的真理，没有限制。这从“赐福”、“繁殖”和“繁多”的含义清楚可知。“赐福”表被赋予一切良善，如第一卷所示（<a href="981.htm">981</a>，<a href="1096.htm">1096</a>，<a href="1420.htm">1420</a>，<a href="1422.htm">1422</a>节）。“繁殖”表他们要被赋予的信之良善，“繁多”表源于此的真理，也如第一卷所示（<a href="43.htm">43</a>，<a href="55.htm">55</a>，<a href="913.htm">913</a>，<a href="983.htm">983</a>节）。<br />在此准确描述谁是属天之人，谁是属灵之人太过冗长。他们早有所描述（如可参看<a href="81.htm">81</a>，<a href="597.htm">597</a>，<a href="607.htm">607</a>，<a href="765.htm">765</a>，<a href="2069.htm">2069</a>，<a href="2078.htm">2078</a>节等）。一般来说，属天之人是指那些拥有对主之爱的人，而属灵之人是指那些拥有对邻之仁的人。至于拥有对主之爱和拥有对邻之仁之间的区别，可参看2023节。属天之人是指那些对良善的情感源于良善之人，而属灵之人则是指那些对良善的情感源于真理之人。一开始，所有人都是属天的，因为他们由对主之爱所主导，并通过这爱接受直觉，他们凭这直觉通过对良善的情感，而非通过真理觉察何为良善。<br />后来，当对主之爱不再如原来的样子时，属灵之人便取而代之。当这些人由对邻之爱，也就是仁爱所主导时，他们就被称为属灵的。但对邻之爱，或仁爱，通过真理被植入。他们由此接受良知，并照良知通过对真理的情感，而非通过对良善的情感行事。属灵之人所具有的仁爱看似对良善的情感，其实是对真理的情感。由于这种表象，仁爱仍被称作良善。但这良善其实是由他们的信所产生的良善。主在约翰福音中所指的就是这些人：<br />我就是门，凡从我进来的，必然得救，并且出入得草吃。我是好牧人，我认识我的羊，我的羊也认识我。我另外有羊，不是这圈里的；我必须领他们来，他们也要听我的声音，并且要合成一群，归一个牧人了。（约翰福音<a href="http://39-27.cn/约10.9.htm">10:9</a>，<a href="http://39-27.cn/约10.14.htm">14</a>，<a href="http://39-27.cn/约10.16.htm">16</a>）</p>

Behold I will bless him; and will make him fruitful very exceedingly. That this signifies that they should be imbued and gifted with the goods of faith and with the derivative truths beyond measure, 
is evident from the signification of being "blessed," of being "fruitful," and of being "multiplied." To be "blessed" signifies to be gifted with all goods (as shown in Part First, n. 981, 1096, 1420, 
1422). To be "fruitful" denotes the goods of faith with which they should be gifted; and to be "multiplied" denotes the truths thence derived (as also shown in Part First, n. 43, 55, 913, 983).  [2] 
Who the celestial are, and who the spiritual, it would be too tedious to describe here, and they have been described already (as may be seen n. 81, 597, 607, 765, 2069, 2078, and in many other places). 
In general, the celestial are those who have love to the Lord, and the spiritual those who have charity toward the neighbor. (What the distinction is between having love to the Lord, and having charity 
toward the neighbor, may be seen above, n. 2023.) The celestial are those who are in the affection of good from good; but the spiritual are those who are in the affection of good from truth. In the 
beginning all were celestial, because they were in love to the Lord; and hence they received perception, by which they perceived good, not from truth, but from the affection of good.  [3] But afterwards, 
when love to the Lord was no longer such as it had been, spiritual men followed, those men being called spiritual who were in love toward the neighbor, or in charity. But love toward the neighbor, 
or charity, was implanted by means of truth; and thereby they received conscience, and acted in accordance with it, not from the affection of good, but from the affection of truth. Charity, with 
the spiritual, appears like the affection of good; but it is the affection of truth. From this appearance, charity is still called good; but it is the good of their faith. These are they who are meant 
by the Lord in John: </p>
<p>I am the door; by Me if any man enter in, he shall be saved, and shall go in and go out, and shall find pasture I am the good shepherd and I know Mine own, and am known of Mine; 
and other sheep I have which are not of this fold; them also I must bring, and they shall hear My voice, and there shall be one flock, and one shepherd (John 10:9, 14, 16). </p>

'Behold I will bless him, I will make him fruitful, and I will multiply him, more and more' means that they were to be furnished and endowed with goods of faith and with truths from that source, without 
limit. This is clear from the meaning of 'being blessed', 'being fruitful', and 'being multiplied'. 'Being blessed' means being endowed with all goods, as shown in Volume One, in <a href="981.htm">981</a>,<a href="1096.htm">1096</a>,<a href="1420.htm">1420</a>,<a href="1422.htm">1422</a>. 
'Being fruitful' means the goods of faith with which they were to be endowed, and 'being multiplied' the truths from that source, as also shown in Volume One, in <a href="43.htm">43</a>, <a href="55.htm">55</a>, <a href="913.htm">913</a>, <a href="983.htm">983</a>. </p>

 Who exactly 
are celestial people and who spiritual would take too long to describe here. See where they have been described already, for example in <a href="81.htm">81</a>, <a href="597.htm">597</a>, <a href="607.htm">607</a>, <a href="765.htm">765</a>, <a href="2069.htm">2069</a>, <a href="2078.htm">2078</a>, and many times elsewhere. In general 
celestial people are those who have love to the Lord, and spiritual those who have charity towards the neighbour. For the distinction between having love to the Lord and having charity towards the 
neighbour, see above <a href="2023.htm">2023</a>. Celestial people are those whose affection for good stems from good, but spiritual people are those whose affection for good stems from truth. To begin with all people were 
celestial, because they were governed by love to the Lord, and from this they received perception by which they perceived what was good, not from truth but from the affection for good. </p>
<p></p>
<p><b>[3]</b>
 But after 
this, when love to the Lord was no longer what it had been, spiritual people took their place, these being called spiritual when they were governed by love towards the neighbour, which is charity. 
But love towards the neighbour, or charity, was implanted by means of truth and in this way they received a conscience in accordance with which they acted, not from an affection for good but from an 
affection for truth. With them charity looks like the affection for good, but is in fact the affection for truth. Because it looks like the affection for good charity is still referred to as good. But 
that good is a good arising out of their faith. It is these who are meant by the Lord in John, </p>
<blockquote>
I am the door. If anyone enters by Me he will be saved, and will go in and out, and find pasture. I 
am the good Shepherd; and I know My own and am known by My own. And other sheep I have which are not of this fold; I must bring them also, and they will hear My voice, and there will be one flock and 
one Shepherd. <a href="http://bible.gospelcom.net/cgi-bin/bible?passage=John%2010:9,%2014,%2016&amp;version=ESV&amp;interface=print&amp;showfn=yes&amp;showxref">John 10:9, 14, 16</a>.

`Ecce benedicam illi, fructificari faciam illum, et multiplicari faciam illum, in valde valde': quod significent quod imbuerentur et donarentur bonis fidei et veris inde immensum, constat ex significatione 
`benedici, fructificari et multiplicari'; `benedici' significat donari omnibus bonis, ut in Parte Prima ostensum n. 981, 1096, 1420, 1422; `fructificari' significat bona fidei quibus donarentur, 
et `multiplicari' vera inde, ut etiam in Parte Prima ostensum, n. 43, 55, 913, 983.  [2] Quinam caelestes sunt et quinam spirituales, prolixum foret {1} hic describere; prius descripti sunt quae videantur, 
ut n. 81, 597, 607, 765, 2069, 2078, et pluries alibi: in genere caelestes sunt qui amorem in Dominum habent ac spirituales qui charitatem erga proximum; quae distinctio sit inter habere amorem 
in Dominum et charitatem erga proximum, videatur supra n. 2023: caelestes sunt qui in affectione boni ex bono sunt, at spirituales qui in affectione boni ex vero: omnes ab initio fuerunt caelestes 
quia in amore in Dominum, inde acceperunt perceptionem qua percipiebant bonum, non ex vero, sed ex affectione boni; [3] sed postea cum amor in Dominum non talis factus, successerunt spirituales, et spirituales 
homines tunc dicti, quando in amore erga proximum seu in charitate fuerant; sed amor erga proximum seu charitas implantabatur per {2} verum, et sic acceperunt conscientiam secundum quam agebant, 
non ex affectione boni sed ex affectione veri; charitas apud eos apparet sicut affectio boni sed est affectio veri; ex apparentia usque vocatur charitas etiam bonum sed est bonum fidei eorum; hi 
sunt qui intellecti sunt a Domino apud Johannem, 	Ego sum ostium, per Me si quis introiverit, salvabitur, et ingredietur et egredietur, et pascuum inveniet:... Ego sum Pastor bonus, et cognosco Meos, 
et cognoscor a Meis;... et alias oves habeo, quae non sunt ex ovili hoc, etiam illas oportet Me adducere, vocemque Meam audient, et fiet unus grex, 	et unus Pastor, x 9, 14, 16. 	@1 i nimis$ 	@2 i 
illis a Domino.$ </p>
