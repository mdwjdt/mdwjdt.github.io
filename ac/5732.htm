<h3 align="center" class="ired">属天的奥秘 第5732节</h3>
<h4 align="center"></h4><p><strong>5732.</strong>“约瑟吩咐管家的说”表来自它自己的流注。这从“吩咐”和“管家的”的含义清楚可知：“吩咐”是指流注（<a href="5486.htm">5486</a>节）；“管家的”是指担当交流者的人。流注来自它自己，即约瑟所代表的内在属天人，这是显而易见的。“吩咐”之所以是指流注，是因为在天堂，没有人被命令或吩咐。相反，思维会共享，其他人则照这些思维自由行动。思维的交流，连同愿意做成某事的渴望就是流注；对领受者来说则是觉知，这就是为何“吩咐”也表示觉知（<a href="3661.htm">3661</a>，<a href="3682.htm">3682</a>节）。<br />此外，在天堂，他们不仅思考，还彼此交谈，但谈论的是智慧的事。然而，在他们所说的话中找不到一丝一个人给另一个人的命令或吩咐的痕迹，因为没有人愿意成为主人，由此视另一个人为仆人。相反，人人都愿意事奉和服侍别人。由此可见，天堂存在什么样的管理形式，主在马太福音中描述了这种形式：<br />只是在你们中间不可这样。你们中间谁愿为大，就必作你们的用人。你们中间谁愿为首，就必作你们的仆人。（马太福音<a href="http://39-27.cn/太20.26.htm">20:26</a>，<a href="http://39-27.cn/太20.27.htm">27</a>）<br /><br />你们中间谁为大，谁就要作你们的用人。凡自高的必降为卑，自卑的必升为高。（马太福音<a href="http://39-27.cn/太23.11.htm">23:11</a>，<a href="http://39-27.cn/太23.12.htm">12</a>）<br />凡从心里爱邻舍，或在无私地向他人行善中感到快乐和幸福的人，即拥有对邻之仁的人都如此行。</p>

And he commanded him that was over his house, saying. That this signifies influx from himself, is evident from the signification of "commanding," as being influx (n. 5486); and from the signification 
of "him that was over his house," as being which communicated. That it was from himself, namely, from the internal celestial, which Joseph represents, is plain. That "to command" is influx, is because 
in heaven no one is commanded or ordered; but thought is communicated, and the other acts willingly in accordance therewith. Communication of thought together with a desire which wills that something 
be done, is influx, and on the part of the recipient is perception, and therefore by "commanding" is signified also perception (n. 3661, 3682). [2] Moreover in heaven they not only think, but also 
talk together, but about things of wisdom; yet in their conversation there is nothing of command from one to another, for no one desires to be master and thereby to look upon another as a servant; but 
everyone desires to minister to and serve the others. From this it is plain what form of government there is in the heavens, which is described by the Lord in Matthew: </p>
<p>     It shall not be so among 
you; but whosoever would become great among you should be your minister, and whosoever would be first should be your servant (Matt. 20:26, 27); </p>
<p>and again: </p>
<p>     He that is greatest among you shall be 
your minister. Whosoever shall exalt himself shall be humbled, and whosoever shall humble himself shall be exalted (Matt. 23:11, 12).  He does this who loves his neighbor from the heart, or who feels 
delight and blessedness in doing good to others for no selfish end; that is, who has charity toward the neighbor. </p>

<p align="center"><b>Elliott(1983-1999) 5732</b></p><p><b>5732.</b>
'And he commanded the one who was over his house, saying' means an influx from itself. This is clear from the meaning of 'commanding as an influx, dealt with in <a href="5486.htm">5486</a>, and from the meaning of 'the one 
who was over his house' as the one who was to serve as communicator. The fact that the influx came from itself - from the internal celestial man, which 'Joseph' represents - is self-evident. The reason 
why 'commanding' means influx is that no one in heaven is given commands or orders. On the contrary one shares his thoughts and the other freely acts in accordance with them. The communication of thought, 
together with a desire to see something put into effect, is influx; and on the part of the receiver it is perception, which is why 'commanding' also means perception, <a href="3661.htm">3661</a>, <a href="3682.htm">3682</a>. </p>
<p></p>
<p><b>[2]</b>
 Furthermore 
those in heaven not only think but also talk to one another - about those things that are matters of wisdom. Yet there is not in what they say any trace of an order given to another; for no one 
wishes to be the master and consequently regard another as his slave. Rather, each wishes to minister and be of service to another. From this one may see what form of government exists in heaven, the 
form described by the Lord in Matthew, </p>
<blockquote>
It shall not be so among you, but whoever has the wish to become great among you must be your minister, and whoever has the wish to be first must be your servant. 
<a href="http://bible.gospelcom.net/cgi-bin/bible?passage=Matt%2020:26,%2027&amp;version=ESV&amp;interface=print&amp;showfn=yes&amp;showxref">Matt 20:26, 27</a>. 
</blockquote>
<p>And in the same gospel, </p>
<p>He who is the greatest of you shall be your minister; whoever exalts himself will be humbled, and whoever humbles himself will be exalted. </p>
<p>This is 
how a person who has heartfelt love of his neighbour behaves - a person who feels delight and bliss in doing good to others for no selfish reason, that is, one who has charity towards the neighbour. </p>

`Et praecepit illi qui super domo sua, dicendo':  quod significet influxum a se, constat ex significatione `praecipere' quod sit influxus, de qua n. 5486; et a significatione `qui super domo sua' quod 
sit qui communicaret; quod a se, nempe ab interno caelesti quod `Josephus' repraesentat, patet.  Quod `praecipere' sit influxus, est quia in caelo non praecipitur {1}aut mandatur alicui, sed cogitatio 
communicatur, et secundum hanc alter libenter facit; communicatio cogitationis cum desiderio quod velit ut aliquid fiat, est influxus, et a parte recipientis est perceptio; quare (t)per praecipere 
etiam significatur perceptio, n. 3661, 3682. [2] Praeterea in caelo non solum cogitant, sed etiam inter se loquuntur, {2}at de illis rebus quae sunt sapientiae, {3}verum sermoni illorum non inest aliquid 
mandati ad alterum, nullus enim vult dominus esse et sic spectare alium ut servum, sed unusquisque vult ministrae et alteri inservire; inde patet qualis forma regiminis est in caelis; forma illa 
describitur a Domino apud Matthaeum,  Non sic erit inter vos; sed quisquis voluerit inter vos magnum fieri, esse {4}debebit vester minister; et quisquis voluerit esse primus, esse debebit vester servus, 
xx 26,27:  et apud eundem, Qui maximus est vestrum, erit minister vester; quisquis se exaltaverit, humiliabitur, et quisquis humiliaverit se, exaltabitur, xxiii 11, 12. Ita facit qui ex corde amat 
proximum; seu qui jucundum et beatum sentit in faciendo aliis bonum {5}ex nulla causa sui, hoc est, qui  charitatem erga proximum habet. @1 seu$ @2 sed$ @3 at$ @4 debet I $ @5 absque remuneratione$ </p>
