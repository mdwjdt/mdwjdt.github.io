<h3 align="center" class="ired">属天的奥秘 第145节</h3>
<h4 align="center"></h4><p><strong>145.</strong>在圣经中，“名”同样指本质，“看到并称其名”亦指了解其本质。例如：“我要将暗中的宝物和隐密的财宝赐给你，使你知道题名召你的，就是我耶和华以色列的神。因我仆人雅各，我所拣选的以色列的缘故，我就题名召你。我加给你名号，你却不认识我。”（以赛亚书<a href="http://39-27.cn/赛45.3.htm">45:3</a>-<a href="http://39-27.cn/赛45.4.htm">4</a>）在此，“题名”、“加名”即指预知其性。<br />又如：“你必得新名的称呼，是耶和华亲口所起的。”（以赛亚书<a href="http://39-27.cn/赛62.2.htm">62:2</a>）从上下文可知 ，这表示他们将转变其性。<br />再如：“以色列啊，你不要害怕，因为我救赎了你。我曾题你的名召你，你是属我的。”（以赛亚书<a href="http://39-27.cn/赛43.1.htm">43:1</a>）这表示主了解其性。<br />再如：“你们向上举目，看谁创造这万象，按数目领出，他一一称其名。”（以赛亚书<a href="http://39-27.cn/赛40.26.htm">40:26</a>）这表示主了解它们全部。<br />再如：“在撒狄，你还有几名是未曾污秽自己衣服的……凡得胜的，必这样穿白衣。我也必不从生命册上涂抹他的名，且要在我父面前，和我父众使者面前认他的名。”（启示录<a href="http://39-27.cn/启3.4.htm">3:4</a>-<a href="http://39-27.cn/启3.5.htm">5</a>）<br />再如：“名字没有记在羔羊生命册上的人……”在以上经文中，“名”绝非指名，而是指性。在天堂，所了解的也不是名，而是性。</p>

<p><strong>[NCE]145.</strong> In the Word as well, a name means the essence of a thing and seeing something and naming it means recognizing its nature, as in Isaiah:<br />I will give you the treasures of the dark and the hidden riches of secret places, in order that you may know that I am Jehovah; the one who gives you your name; the God of Israel. For the sake of my servant Jacob and of Israel my chosen, I have also called you by your name; I have surnamed you, but you do not know me. (<a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_145/bible_king-james-version_isaiah_45_3-4" target=_top>Isaiah 45:3-4</a>)<br />Calling by name and naming symbolize foreseeing a person's nature. In the same author:<br />A new name will be given to you, which the mouth of Jehovah will declare. (<a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_145/bible_king-james-version_isaiah_62_2" target=_top>Isaiah 62:2</a>)<br />This time it means that the person will change, as is evident from the verses before and after it. Again:<br />Don't be afraid, Israel, because I have redeemed you; I have called you by your name: You Are Mine. (<a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_145/bible_king-james-version_isaiah_43_1" target=_top>Isaiah 43:1</a>)<br />The message here is that he knows what we are like. Once again:<br />Raise your eyes up high and see who has created those things, leading their legions out by number. He will call them all by name. (<a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_145/bible_king-james-version_isaiah_40_26" target=_top>Isaiah 40:26</a>)<br />In other words, he knows everyone. In Revelation:<br />You have a few names in Sardis that have not defiled their clothes. Those who conquer will be dressed in white clothes, and I will not delete their name from the book of life; and I will proclaim their name before my Father and before his angels. (<a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_145/bible_king-james-version_revelation_3_4-5" target=_top>Revelation 3:4-5</a>)<br />In another place:<br />... those whose names are not written in the Lamb's book of life. (<a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_145/bible_king-james-version_revelation_13_8" target=_top>Revelation 13:8</a>)<br />In none of these places does names literally mean names but rather what the people are like. No one knows anyone's name in heaven, either, but each knows what the other is like. </p>
<p align="center"><b>Potts(1905-1910) 145</b></p><p><b>145.</b>
In the Word also by "name" is signified the essence of a thing, and by "seeing and calling by name" is signified to know the quality. As in Isaiah: </p>
<p>     I will give thee the treasures of darkness, and 
hidden riches of secret places, that thou mayest know that I, Jehovah, who call thee by thy name, am the God of Israel. For Jacob My servant's sake, and Israel My chosen, I have even called thee by 
thy name, I have surnamed thee, and thou hast not known Me (Isa. 45:3-4). In this passage, to "call by name" and to "surname" signifies to foreknow the quality. Again: </p>
<p>     Thou shalt be called by 
a new name, which the mouth of Jehovah shall declare (Isa. 62:2),signifying to become of another character, as appears from the preceding and subsequent verses. Again: </p>
<p>     Fear not, O Israel, for I 
have redeemed thee, I have called thee by thy name; thou art Mine (Isa. 43:1), denoting that He knew their quality. Again in the same Prophet: </p>
<p>     Lift up your eyes on high, and behold who hath created 
these things, that bringeth out their army by number. He will call them all by name (Isa. 40:26), meaning that He knew them all. In the Revelation: </p>
<p>Thou hast a few names even in Sardis who have 
not defiled their garments: he that overcometh, the same shall be clothed in white raiment, and I will not blot out his name out of the book of life, but I will confess his name before My Father, and 
before His angels (Rev. 3:4-5).      Whose names are not written in the Lamb's book of life (Rev. 13:8). By "names" in these passages are by no means meant names, but qualities; nor is the name of 
anyone ever known in heaven, but his quality. </p>

In the Word too 'name' means the essential nature of a real thing, and 'seeing and calling by name' knowing characters, as in Isaiah,   I will give you the treasures of darkness and the hoarded riches 
of secret places, that you may know that it is I, Jehovah, the one calling you by name, the God of Israel. For the sake of My servant Jacob, and of Israel My chosen, and I have called you by name, 
I have surnamed you, but you do not know Me. <a href="http://bible.gospelcom.net/cgi-bin/bible?passage=Isa%2045:3,%204&amp;version=ESV&amp;interface=print&amp;showfn=yes&amp;showxref">Isa 45:3, 4</a>.   Here 'calling by name' and 'surnaming' mean knowing his character beforehand. In the same prophet,  </p>
<blockquote>
You will be called by a new name 
which the mouth of Jehovah will declare. <a href="http://bible.gospelcom.net/cgi-bin/bible?passage=Isa%2062:2&amp;version=ESV&amp;interface=print&amp;showfn=yes&amp;showxref">Isa 62:2</a>.  
</blockquote>
<p>This stands for his becoming a different person, as is clear from what precedes and what follows these words. In the same prophet, </p>
<blockquote>
O Israel, 
fear not, for I have redeemed you, I have called you by your name, you are Mine. <a href="http://bible.gospelcom.net/cgi-bin/bible?passage=Isa%2043:1&amp;version=ESV&amp;interface=print&amp;showfn=yes&amp;showxref">Isa 43:1</a>.  
</blockquote>
<p>This stands for knowing character. Again in the same prophet, </p>
<blockquote>
Lift up your eyes on high and see; who 
created these? He who brings out their host by number; He will call them all by name. <a href="http://bible.gospelcom.net/cgi-bin/bible?passage=Isa%2040:26&amp;version=ESV&amp;interface=print&amp;showfn=yes&amp;showxref">Isa 40:26</a>.   
</blockquote>
This stands for His knowing them all. In Revelation, </p>
<blockquote>
You have a few names in Sardis, who have not 
soiled their garments. He who conquers will be clad in white garments and I will not blot his name out of the book of life; and I will confess his name before My Father and before His angels. <a href="http://bible.gospelcom.net/cgi-bin/bible?passage=Rev%203:4,%205&amp;version=ESV&amp;interface=print&amp;showfn=yes&amp;showxref">Rev 3:4, 5</a>.   
</blockquote>
Elsewhere in the same book, </p>
<blockquote>
Whose names have not been written in the book of life of the Lamb. <a href="http://bible.gospelcom.net/cgi-bin/bible?passage=Rev%2013:8&amp;version=ESV&amp;interface=print&amp;showfn=yes&amp;showxref">Rev 13:8</a>.  
</blockquote>
<p>In these places 'names' is in no way used to mean names but people's characters. 
Nor in heaven do they know anyone's name, only his character.  </p>

</p><b>145.</b>
In Verbo quoque per 'nomen' significatur essentia rei, et per 'videre et vocare nomine' nosse quales sunt; ut apud Esaiam, 	Dabo tibi thesauros tenebrarum, et absconditas opes occultorum, propterea 
ut scias quod Ego Jehovah vocans nomen tuum, Deus Israelis: propter servum Meum Jacobum, et Israelem electum Meum, et vocavi te nomine tuo, cognominavi te, et non novisti Me, xlv 3, 4; </p>
<p>ibi per 'vocare 
nomine' et 'cognominare' significatur praescire qualis est: apud eundem, 	Vocabitur tibi nomen novum, quod os Jehovae declarabit illud, lxii 2; </p>
<p>pro quod alius fieret, ut constat ab antecedentibus 
et sequentibus ibi: apud eundem, 	Israel, ne timeas, nam redemi te, vocavi nomine tuo, Mihi tu, xliii I; </p>
<p>ubi pro quod noverit qualis: iterum apud eundem, 	Tollite in altum oculos vestros, et videte, 
quis creavit illa, educens in numero exercitum eorum; omnes nomine vocabit, xl 26; </p>
<p>pro quod omnes nosset: in Apocalypsi, 	Habes pauca nomina in Sardibus, quae [non] polluerunt vestimenta sua....Qui 
vicerit, hic induetur vestimentis albis, et non delebo nomen ejus e libro vitae, confiteborque nomen ejus coram Patre Meo, et coram angelis Ejus, iii 4, 5: </p>
<p>alibi, 	 	Quorum sunt scripta nomina in 
Libro Vitae Agni, xiii 8. Per 'nomina' bis locis nusquam intelliguntur nomina sed quales sunt; nec usquam alicujus nomen in caelo noscitur sed qualis est.
