<h3 align="center" class="ired">属天的奥秘 第6679节</h3>
<h4 align="center"></h4><p><strong>6679.</strong>“不照埃及王吩咐她们的行”表没有照着那些陷入虚假之人的意图而行。这从“不照吩咐的行”和“埃及王”的含义清楚可知：“不照吩咐的行”是指没有照他们的意图而行，也就是说，那些陷入虚假的人没能毁灭“儿子”所表示的真理，尽管他们的意图是要通过他们所能采取的任何方式来毁灭它们（参看<a href="6676.htm">6676</a>节）；“埃及王”是指反对教会真理的分离的记忆知识（参看<a href="6651.htm">6651</a>节），因而是指虚假，因为这记忆知识就是虚假。</p>

<p align="center"><b>Potts(1905-1910) 6679</b></p><p><b>6679.</b>
And did not as the king of Egypt spoke to them. That this signifies that it was not done as those who were in falsities intended, is evident from the signification of "they did not do as he spoke," as 
being that it was not done as they intended, namely, that those who were in falsities were not able to destroy the truths which are signified by "sons," but that they intended to destroy them in every 
way they could (see n. 6676); and from the signification of "the king of Egypt," as being separated memory-knowledge which is opposed to the truth of the church (see n. 6651), thus falsity, for this 
memory-knowledge is falsity. </p>

<p align="center"><b>Elliott(1983-1999) 6679</b></p><p><b>6679.</b>
'And did not do as the king of Egypt spoke to them' means that the intention of those under the influence of falsities was not carried out. This is clear from the meaning of 'did not do as he spoke' 
as the fact that their intention was not carried out, that is, they were unable to destroy the truths meant by 'the boys', even though their intention was to destroy them by whatever method they could, <a href="6676.htm">6676</a>; and from the meaning of 'the king of Egypt' as separated factual knowledge that is opposed to the Church's truth, dealt with in <a href="6651.htm">6651</a>, thus falsity since that factual knowledge is false.  </p>

`Et non fecerunt quemadmodum locutus ad (x)illas rex Aegypti': quod significet quod non ita factum sicut intendebant qui in falsis, constat ex significatione `non fecerunt quemadmodum locutus' quod sit 
non ita factum sicut intendebant, nempe quod non destruere potuerint vera quae significantur per `filios,' sed quod {1}intenderent destruere omni modo quo possent, {2} n. 6676; et ex significatione 
`regis Aegypti' quod sit scientificum separatum quod contra verum Ecclesiae, de qua n. 6651, ita falsum, nam scientificum illud est falsum. 	@1 intenderint$ 	@2 i videatur supra$ </p>
