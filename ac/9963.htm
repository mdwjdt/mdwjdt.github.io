<h3 align="center" class="ired">属天的奥秘 第9963节</h3>
<h4 align="center"></h4><p><strong>9963.</strong>“当进入会幕，”表在代表天堂和教会的一切事物的敬拜中。这从“进入会幕”的含义清楚可知，“进入会幕”是指代表天堂和教会的一切事物的敬拜。因为“会幕”（Tent，经上或译为帐幕、罩棚或帐棚）代表主所在的天堂（参看<a href="9457.htm">9457</a>，<a href="9481.htm">9481</a>，<a href="9485.htm">9485</a>，<a href="9784.htm">9784</a>节）；因此，当论及亚伦和他的儿子时，“进入会幕”表示对主的敬拜。此外，那时，一切敬拜都在会幕里面和祭坛上执行；因为摆放陈设饼或脸饼，点灯，烧香，在祭坛上献祭，都是在会幕里面进行的。代表性敬拜主要是由这些事物构成的。代表性敬拜是外在敬拜，这外在敬拜代表属源于主并献给主的爱的内在事物，或说是代表源于主并献给主的爱的内在美德，因而代表天堂和教会的一切事物；因为在天堂和教会，一切事物都与源于主并献给主的属于爱的良善和属于信的真理有关。</p>

When they go in into the Tent of meeting. That this signifies in the representative worship of all things of heaven and of the church, is evident from the signification of "going in into the Tent of 
meeting," as being the representative worship of all things of heaven and of the church; for by "the Tent" was represented heaven where the Lord is (see n. 9457, 9481, 9485, 9784); thus by "going into 
it," when said of Aaron and his sons, is signified the worship of the Lord. Moreover, at that time all worship was performed in the Tent and at the altar; for in the Tent were set in order the breads 
of faces, the lamps were lighted, incense was burned, and sacrifices were offered at the altar. In these things the representative worship chiefly consisted. Representative worship is external worship 
that represents the internal things which belong to love from the Lord to the Lord, thus which are all things of heaven and of the church; for in heaven and in the church all things bear relation to 
the good that is of love, and to the truth that is of faith, from the Lord to the Lord. </p>

<p align="center"><b>Elliott(1983-1999) 9963</b></p><p><b>9963.</b>
'When they go into the tent of meeting' means in worship representative of all things of heaven and the Church. This is clear from the meaning of 'going into the tent of meeting' as worship representative 
of all things of heaven and the Church. For 'the tent' represented heaven where the Lord was, <a href="9457.htm">9457</a>, <a href="9481.htm">9481</a>, <a href="9485.htm">9485</a>, <a href="9784.htm">9784</a>, so that 'going into it', when it refers to Aaron and his sons, means worship 
of the Lord. Furthermore all the worship at that time took place within the tent and at the altar; for within the tent the loaves of the presence were laid out, the lamps were lit, and incense was offered, 
and at the altar sacrifice took place. These things primarily were the ones in which representative worship consisted. Representative worship is the outward performance of worship representing 
the inward virtues of love derived from the Lord and offered back to Him, thus all things of heaven and the Church; for in heaven and in the Church everything has connection with the good belonging to 
love and the truth belonging to faith which are derived from the Lord and offered to Him.  </p>

`In intrandis illis in tentorium conventus': quod significet in cultu repraesentativo omnium caeli et Ecclesiae, constat ex significatione `intrare in tentorium conventus' quod sit cultus repraesentativus 
omnium caeli et Ecclesiae, per `tentorium' enim repraesentabatur caelum ubi Dominus, n. 9457, 9481, 9485, 9784; ita per `intrare in illud,' cum de Aharone et filiis ejus, significatur cultus Domini; 
omnis etiam cultus eo tempore fiebat in tentorio, et ad altare, in tentorio enim disponebantur panes facierum, accendebantur lucernae, et suffiebatur, et ad altare sacrificabatur; in illis praecipue 
{1}constabat cultus repraesentativus; cultus repraesentativus est cultus externus repraesentans interna quae sunt amoris {2} a Domino in Dominum (d)ita quae sunt omnia caeli et Ecclesiae, nam {3}in 
caelo et in Ecclesia omnia se referunt ad bonum quod amoris et ad verum quod fidei a Domino in Dominum. @1 consistebat$ @2 i et fidei$ @3 ibi$ </p>
