<h3 align="center" class="ired">属天的奥秘 第4842节</h3>
<h4 align="center"></h4><p><strong>4842.</strong>“犹大就说”表总体上雅各的后代，尤其来源于犹大的。这从“犹大”的含义清楚可知，“犹大”在近似意义上是指来自雅各，尤其通过犹大来自雅各的民族，如前所述（<a href="4815.htm">4815</a>节）。在圣言中，犹大与以色列之间的确有区别；就历史意义而言，“犹大”表示犹大支派，“以色列”表示与该支派分离的那十个支派。但就内义或灵义而言，“犹大”代表教会的属天元素，也就是良善；“以色列”代表教会的属灵元素，也就是真理。而就反面意义而言，“犹大”代表教会的邪恶，“以色列”代表教会的虚假，无论这些邪恶或虚假存在于哪里，无论存在于犹太人当中还是存在于以色列人当中。因为圣言的内义或灵义是普世的，不像外在意义或历史意义那样划分支派。正因如此，“犹大”在近似意义上表示来自雅各，尤其通过犹大来自雅各的整个民族。</p>

And Judah said. That this signifies in general the posterity of Jacob, specifically that from Judah, is evident from the signification of "Judah" in the proximate sense, as being the nation which was 
from Jacob, and specifically that which was from Jacob by Judah, as also above (n. 4815). In the Word a distinction is indeed made between Judah and Israel, and in the historic sense by "Judah" is meant 
the tribe of Judah, and by "Israel" the ten tribes which were separated from that tribe. But in the internal or spiritual sense by Judah is represented the celestial or good of the church, and by 
Israel the spiritual or truth of the church; while in the opposite sense by Judah is represented the evil of the church, and by Israel the falsity of the church, wherever these existed, whether with the 
Jews or with the Israelites. For the internal or spiritual sense of the Word is universal, and does not distinguish the tribes, as does the external or historic sense. Hence it is that by "Judah" in 
the proximate sense is signified the whole nation which was from Jacob, and specifically that which was from Jacob by Judah. </p>

'Judah said' means in general the descendants of Jacob, specifically those descended through Judah. This is clear from the meaning of 'Judah' in the proximate sense as the nation descended from Jacob, 
and specifically those descended from Jacob through Judah, as also stated above in <a href="4815.htm">4815</a>. In the Word a distinction is indeed drawn between Judah and Israel, 'Judah' being used in the historical sense 
to mean the tribe of Judah, and 'Israel' to mean the ten tribes that had been separated from that tribe. But in the internal or spiritual sense 'Judah' represents the celestial element of the Church, 
which is good, and 'Israel' the spiritual element, which is truth. In the contrary sense however 'Judah' represents the evil of the Church and 'Israel' the falsity of the Church, wherever such evil 
or falsity existed, whether among Jews or among Israelites. For the internal or spiritual sense of the Word is universal and does not draw the same distinctions between the tribes as are drawn in the 
external or historical sense. This is the reason why in the proximate sense 'Judah' means the whole nation descended from Jacob, but specifically those descended from Jacob through Judah. </p>

</p><b>4842.</b>
`Dixit Jehudah': quod significet {1} in genere posteritatem Jacobi, in specie illam ex Jehudah, constat ex significatione `Jehudae' in sensu proximo quod sit gens quae a Jacobo, `et' in specie quae 
Jacobo ex Jehudah, ut quoque supra n. 4815.  In Verbo quidem distinguitur inter Jehudam et Israelem, et in sensu historico per Jehudam intelligitur tribus Jehudae, et per Israelem decem tribus quae 
ab illa tribu separatae fuerunt; sed in sensu interno seu spirituali per `Jehudam' repraesentatur Ecclesiae caeleste seu bonum, et per `Israelem' Ecclesiae spirituale seu verum; at in opposito 
sensu per `Jehudam' Ecclesiae malum, et per `Israelem' Ecclesiae falsum, ubi cumque illa erant, sive apud Judaeos sive apud Israelitas; sensu enim internus seu spiritualis Verbi est universalis, et 
non distingui tribus sicut sensus externus seu historicus; inde est quod per `Jehudam' in sensu proximo significetur omnis gens quae a Jacobo, at in specie quae Jacobo ex Jehudah.      @1 significat AI$ </p>
