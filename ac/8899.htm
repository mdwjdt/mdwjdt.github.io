<h3 align="center" class="ired">属天的奥秘 第8899节</h3>
<h4 align="center"></h4><p><strong>8899.</strong>“耶和华你神所赐你的”表神性所在的地方和来自祂的流注。这从以下事实清楚可知：这些话论及此处由“地”所表示的天堂（参看<a href="8898.htm">8898</a>节），因此，“耶和华神”是指那里的神性，“赐”是指流注；因为总体上天堂与所有人，以及具体的每个人都是接受来自神性的流注的。尊敬父母这一诫命表示这些事，这看起来很奇怪，因为它们与字义相去甚远。但要知道，十诫既是世人，也是天上之人的生活准则。字义或外在意义是为了世人，灵义或内义是为天上的人；因此，这两层意义，即外在和内在意义，是为了那些在世上的时候也在天堂里的人，也就是为了那些照着教义的真理过着良善生活的人。十诫也是为了天上的人，这一点从圣言中一切事物的内义，以及这一事实清楚看出来：耶和华神，也就是主自己所说的话不仅是为了世人，或世界，也是为了天使，事实上是为了整个天堂。因为从主发出的神性真理流经天堂，并向下传到世人那里。主亲自从西乃山上所说的这十条诫就是这种情况。<br />由于这些<br />由于这些诫命的宣布不仅是为了世人，还为了天上的人，所以这二者对它们的理解不可能是一样的。如这条诫命就是这样，即：当尊敬父母，使他们的日子在耶和华神所赐他们的地上得以长久。因为在天上，父母和孩子不像地上那样聚在一起；因此在那里，主取代了“父”，祂的国取代了“母”。他们的日子得以长久也不可能是指着天上的人说的，因为他们永远住在那里。那里的“地”也不能理解为这条诫命所指的迦南地，而要理解为天上的迦南，或天堂。由于“父母”表示主及其国度，所以这条诫命按顺序是第四条诫命，在神圣性上超越接下来的几条诫命。敬拜耶和华，也就是主的诫命是第一和第二条诫命，因为这是最神圣的诫命。接下来是安息日的诫命，因为这条诫命在至高意义上表示神性本身和神性人身在主里面的合一。然后是尊敬父母的诫命，因为这条诫命表示对主的爱，以及由此而来的对来自主的良善和真理的爱。由于这条诫命表示这些事，所以蔑视父母被列为“流人血”（以西结书<a href="http://39-27.cn/结22.6.htm">22:6</a>，<a href="http://39-27.cn/结22.7.htm">7</a>）所表示的罪行之一；因此，顽梗悖逆的儿子要用石头打死（申命记<a href="http://39-27.cn/申21.18.htm">21:18</a>-<a href="http://39-27.cn/申21.21.htm">21</a>）。</p>

Which Jehovah thy God giveth thee. That this signifies where the Divine is and the consequent influx, is evident from the fact that these words are spoken of heaven, which is here signified by "the land" 
(see n. 8898); consequently "Jehovah God" denotes the Divine therein, and "to give" denotes influx; for heaven in general with all, and in particular with each one, is the reception of influx from 
the Divine. That such things are signified by the commandment about honoring parents, may seem strange, because they are remote from the sense of the letter. But be it known that the commandments of 
the Decalogue are rules of life both for those who are in the world and for those who are in heaven-the sense of the letter or the external sense being for those who are in the world, and the spiritual 
or internal sense for those who are in heaven-and consequently both senses, external as well as internal, are for those who while they are in the world are also in heaven, that is, for those who are 
in the good of life according to the truths of doctrine. That the commandments of the Decalogue are also for those who are in heaven, is plain from the internal sense of all things in the Word, and 
clearly from the fact that the things which Jehovah God (that is, the Lord) Himself speaks, are not only for men, or for the world; but are also for angels, nay, for the whole heaven, because the Divine 
truth which proceeds from the Lord flows through heaven and passes through down unto man. This is the case with these ten commandments, which the Lord Himself spoke from Mount Sinai. [2] Inasmuch 
as these commandments were spoken not only for those who are in the world, but also for those who are in heaven, therefore they could not be perceived in the same way by both-as for instance this commandment, 
that they should honor father and mother in order that their days might be prolonged upon the land which Jehovah God would give them; for in heaven parents and children do not come together the 
same as on earth; and therefore for "father" there they have the Lord, and for "mother" His kingdom. Nor can it be said of those in heaven that their days would be prolonged, because they live there 
to eternity; nor can "land" be understood there as in this commandment to mean the land of Canaan, but instead the heavenly Canaan or heaven. As by "father and mother" are meant the Lord and His kingdom, 
therefore this commandment is the fourth in order, and surpasses in holiness those which follow. The commandment concerning the worship of Jehovah, that is, the Lord, is first and second, because 
the most holy one. Next comes the commandment concerning the Sabbath, because by this in the supreme sense is signified the union of the Divine Itself and the Divine Human in the Lord. After this follows 
the commandment concerning honoring parents, because by this is signified the love of the Lord and the consequent love of good and truth which are from the Lord. As these things are signified by 
this commandment, therefore contempt for parents is enumerated among the crimes which are signified by "shedding blood" (Ezek. 22:6, 7) and for this reason disobedient and rebellious sons were stoned 
(Deut. 21:18-21). </p>

'Which Jehovah your God gives you' means where the Divine is, and influx from Him. This is clear from the consideration that these words are spoken in regard to heaven, meant here by 'the land', <a href="8898.htm">8898</a>, 
so that 'Jehovah God' is the Divine there, and 'giving' is influx; for heaven with all people in general and with each person in particular consists in the reception of influx from the Divine. It may 
seem strange that such things are meant by the commandment about honouring parents, for they are remote from the literal meaning. But it should be recognized that the Ten Commandments are rules both 
for those in the world and for those in heaven. The literal or external sense is for those in the world, the spiritual or internal sense for those in heaven; and this being so, both senses - the external 
and the internal - are for those who while in the world are also in heaven, that is, those leading a good life in conformity with the truths of religious teachings. The fact that the Ten Commandments 
are also for those in heaven is evident from the internal sense of all that is in the Word, and especially from the consideration that things spoken by Jehovah God, that is, the Lord Himself, are 
not only for men or the world but also for angels, indeed for the whole of heaven. For Divine Truth which goes forth from the Lord flows through heaven; it passes right through to man. This is so with 
these Ten Commandments which the Lord Himself spoke from Mount Sinai. </p>

 Since these commandments were declared not only for those in the world but also for those in heaven they could not be understood 
in the same way in both places. That was so with this commandment that they should honour father and mother, in order that their days might be prolonged on the land that Jehovah God would give 
them. For in heaven parents and children do not come together as on earth; therefore the Lord is in place of 'father' there, and His kingdom in place of 'mother'. Nor can it be said of those in heaven 
that their days would be prolonged, since they live there forever. Neither can 'land' there be taken to mean the land of Canaan, as it is in this commandment, but the heavenly Canaan instead which is 
heaven. Since 'father and mother' means the Lord and His kingdom this commandment is fourth in order, surpassing in holiness those that come after it. The commandment regarding the worship of Jehovah, 
that is, the Lord, is the first and second, because it is the holiest. After it comes the commandment regarding the sabbath, because in the highest sense the union within the Lord of the Divine Itself 
and the Divine Human is meant by it. Then follows the commandment about honouring parents, because love of the Lord is meant by it, and consequently the love of goodness and truth that come from the 
Lord. Since these things are meant by this commandment, treating parents with contempt is listed among the crimes meant by 'shedding blood', <a href="http://bible.gospelcom.net/cgi-bin/bible?passage=Ezek%2022:6,%207&amp;version=ESV&amp;interface=print&amp;showfn=yes&amp;showxref">Ezek 22:6, 7</a>; and disobedient and stubborn sons were to 
be stoned, <a href="http://bible.gospelcom.net/cgi-bin/bible?passage=Deut%2021:18-21&amp;version=ESV&amp;interface=print&amp;showfn=yes&amp;showxref">Deut 21:18-21</a>. </p>

`Quam Jehovah Deus tuus dat tibi': quod significet ubi Divinum et inde influxus, constat ex eo quod haec dicantur de caelo, quod hic significatur per `terram,' n. 8898; inde `Jehovah Deus' est Divinum 
ibi, et `dare' est influxus, nam caelum in communi apud omnes, et in particulari apud unumquemvis, est receptio influxus a Divino.  Quod talia {1} significentur per praeceptum de honorandis parentibus, 
videri potest alienum, quia distat a sensu litterae; sed sciendum quod praecepta decalogi pro nominis sint tam illis qui in mundo sunt quam illis qui in caelo; sensus litterae seu externus pro illis 
qui in mundo, et sensus spiritualis seu internus pro illis qui in caelo, et inde uterque sensus, tam externus quam internus, pro illis qui dum in mundo etiam in caelo sunt, hoc est, pro illis qui 
in bono vitae secundum vera doctrinae sunt; quod praecepta decalogi etiam sint pro illis qui in caelo sunt, patet a sensu interno omnium quae in Verbo, et evidenter {2} ex eo quod quae Jehovah Deus, hoc 
est, Dominus, Ipse loquitur {3}, non solum sint pro hominibus aut mundo sed etiam pro angelis, immo pro toto caelo, nam Divinum Verum quod procedit a Domino transfluit caelum et pervadit usque ad hominem; 
ita haec decem praecepta quae Ipse Dominus e monte Sinai locutus est; [2] quia haec non solum pro illis qui in mundo sed etiam pro illis qui in caelo dicta sunt, ideo non potuerunt percipi similiter 
utrinque, sicut hoc praeceptum, quod (x)honorarent patrem et matrem {4} propterea ut prolongarentur dies eorum super terra quam Jehovah Deus daret illis; in caelo enim non conveniunt parentes et 
liberi sicut in terra, quare pro `patre' ibi est Dominus, et pro `matre' est regnum Ipsius; nec de illis {5} in caelo dici potest quod prolongarentur dies, quia vivunt ibi in aeternum; nec ibi intelligi 
potest terra, sicut in hoc praecepto terra Canaan, sed pro illa Canaan caelestis seu caelum.  Quia per `patrem et matrem' {6} intelligitur Dominus et regnum Ipsius, idcirco praeceptum hoc est quartum 
in ordine, et sanctitate excedit sequentia; praeceptum de cultu Jehovae, hoc est, Domini, est primum et secundum, quia sanctissimum; dein praeceptum de sabbato, quia per hoc in supremo sensu significatur 
unio Ipsius Divini ac Divini Humani in Domino; post hoc sequitur praeceptum de honorandis parentibus, quia per hoc significatur amor Domini, et inde amor boni et veri quae a Domino.  Quoniam 
{7} haec per hoc praeceptum significantur, idcirco contemptus parentum recensetur inter crimina, quae significantur per `effundere sanguinem,' Ezech. xxii 6, 7; ac ideo filii inoboedientes et refractarii 
lapidabantur, Deut. xxi 18-22. @1 haec$ @2 manifeste$ @3 loquutus est de monte Sinai$ @4 omnia enim quae Ipse Dominus loquitur, talia sunt; et quia simul pro coelo, non possunt percipi similiter 
ibi sicut in mundo, sicut quod honorarent ibi patrem suum et matrem suam$ @5 i qui$ @6 i in sensu interno$ @7 Quia$ </p>
