<h3 align="center" class="ired">属天的奥秘 第6097节</h3>
<h4 align="center"></h4><p><strong>6097.</strong>“我平生的年日又少又苦”表属世层的生命状态充满试探。这从“日”和“年”，以及“雅各的平生”的含义清楚可知：“日”和“年”是指状态，如前所述（<a href="6093.htm">6093</a>，<a href="6095.htm">6095</a>节）；“雅各的平生”是指属世层中的属灵生命（<a href="6093.htm">6093</a>节）。这些日子是“苦”的，表示这种状态下的试探。所有试探看上去都是苦的，因为它们是内心的焦虑和痛苦，可以说是诅咒。因为在这种时候，人陷入其邪恶的状态，因此就在恶灵中间；他们指控他，由此折磨他的良知。然而，天使仍保护他；也就是说，主通过天使保护他。事实上，主将他保持在盼望和信靠中；这盼望和信靠就是那从内使他能进行抵抗的争战的力量。属世层在接受属灵层时，尤其会陷入试探，因为生命的邪恶和教义的虚假就住在这属世层中。雅各指着自己说这话就是由于这个原因，因为他在此代表真理方面的属世层。</p>

<p align="center"><b>Potts(1905-1910) 6097</b></p><p><b>6097.</b>
Few and evil have been the days of the years of my life. That this signifies that the state of life of the natural has been full of temptations, is evident from the signification of "days" and "years," 
as being states (as above, n. 6093, 6095); and from the signification of the "life of Jacob," as being spiritual life in the natural (n. 6093). Temptations in this state are signified by the days having 
been "evil." All temptations appear evil, for the reason that they are interior anxieties and griefs, and as it were damnations; for the man is then let into the state of his evils, consequently 
among evil spirits, who accuse him, and thus torment the conscience; nevertheless the angels defend him, that is, the Lord through angels, for the Lord keeps him in hope and trust, which are the forces 
of combat from within whereby he resists. Especially is the natural let into temptations when it is receiving the spiritual, because in the natural reside evils of life and falsities of doctrine. For 
this reason Jacob says this of himself, because by him is here represented the natural as to truth. </p>

<p align="center"><b>Elliott(1983-1999) 6097</b></p><p><b>6097.</b>
'[Few] and evil have been the days of the years of my life' means that the state of life of the natural has been full of temptations. This is clear from the meaning of 'the days' and 'the years' as states, 
as above in <a href="6093.htm">6093</a>, <a href="6095.htm">6095</a>; and from the meaning of 'Jacob's life' as spiritual life in the natural, also as above in <a href="6093.htm">6093</a>. Temptations in that state are meant by the statement that the days had been 
'evil'. All temptations appear to be evil because they are inner feelings of anxiety and distress, and of seeming damnation. For at such times a person is thrown into a state involving his own evils, 
as a consequence of which he is in the midst of evil spirits who make accusations and thereby torment his conscience. But the angels still protect him, that is, the Lord does so through the angels. 
The Lord preserves in him a sense of hope and trust, which are fighting strengths from within that enable him to offer resistance. The natural is particularly subjected to temptations when it is to receive 
the spiritual, for in it reside evils of life and falsities of doctrine. That is the reason why Jacob says what he does about himself, for here he represents the natural in respect of truth. </p>

</p><b>6097.</b>
`{1}Et mali fuerunt dies annorum vitae meae': quod significet quod status vitae naturalis tentationum plenus, constat ex significatione `dierum et annorum' quod sint status, ut supra n. 6093, 6095; 
et ex significatione `vitae Jacobi' quod sit vita spiritualis in naturali, ut quoque supra n. 6093; tentationes in illo statu significantur per quod `mali' fuissent; omnes tentationes apparent malae ex 
causa quia sunt anxietates et dolores interiores, et quasi damnationes; mittitur enim tunc homo in statum malorum suorum, consequenter inter malos spiritus qui incusant et sic conscientiam cruciant; 
sed usque angeli defendunt, hoc est, Dominus per angelos, Qui tenet illum in spe et fiducia, quae sunt pugnae vires ab interiore ex quibus resistit; naturale imprimis mittitur in tentationes cum recipiet 
spirituale, quia ibi resident mala vitae et falsa doctrinae; eapropter Jacob de se hoc dicit, per illum enim hic repraesentatur naturale quoad verum. </p>
