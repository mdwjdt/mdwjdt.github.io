<h3 align="center" class="ired">属天的奥秘 第10420节</h3>
<h4 align="center"></h4><p><strong>10420</strong>.“因为你的百姓已经败坏了自己”表他们使自己完全背离了神性。这从“败坏了自己”的含义清楚可知，“败坏了自己”当论及敬拜时，是指使自己背离神性，因为敬拜中的一切败坏和偏离都是从神性退回并背离。由于提到了“背离”一词，所以必须简要说明它的含义。那些兴趣在于脱离内在之物的外在事物之人都使自己背离了神性；因为他们向外、向下看，而不是向内、向上看。事实上，当一个人的内在打开时，因而当它在天堂时，他向内或向上看；但当他的内在关闭，只有外在打开时，他向外或向下看；因为他的外在居于世界。因此，当外在与内在分离时，此人无法向上被提升；因为天堂必须作用于其上的那个部分是不可用的，它已经关闭了。这解释了为何对这些人来说，天堂和教会的一切事物都居于幽暗之中，因此他们也不相信这些事物的存在。事实上，这些人从心里否认它们的存在，有些人也嘴上否认。<br />当天堂作用于一个人时，如当内在打开时的情形，它就会将此人引离自我之爱和尘世之爱，并引离从这些爱所涌出的虚假。当内在被提升时，外在也被提升；因为当外在从属于内在时，外在的视角与内在的视角是一样的。但当内在由于关闭而无法被提升时，外在就只朝自我和世界看，因为这时自我之爱和尘世之爱掌权。这也被称作向下看，因为它正朝地狱看，地狱是这些爱掌权的地方；被这些爱主宰的人就与那些住在地狱里的人生活在一起，尽管他没有意识到这一点。此外，就其内层而言，他实实在在背离了主；因为他将背转向主，将脸转向地狱。当人活在肉身时，这一点在他里面是看不到的；但由于正是他的思维和意愿如此行，故正是他的灵如此转动，因为在人里面思考和意愿的，是灵。<br />事实的确如此，这一点在来世是显而易见的；在来世，灵人照着自己的爱而转动。那些爱主爱邻的人不断仰望主；事实上，令人惊讶的是，无论他们的身体转向哪个方向，他们都面向主。因为灵界没有像自然界那样的方向或方位。在灵界，任何人所面向的方向都取决于他的爱，这爱使他转动。但那些爱自己爱世界胜过一切的人则将脸背离主，将自己转向地狱。在那里，每个人都转向那些被类似他的一种爱所主宰的人，无论他们将身体转向哪个方向，都是如此。由此可见使自己背离神性是什么意思，以及在圣言中，“使自己背离或退后”究竟表示什么，如以赛亚书：<br />倚靠雕像的，这等人使自己退后。（以赛亚书<a href="http://39-27.cn/赛42.17.htm">42:17</a>）<br />诗篇：<br />我们的心没有退后。（诗篇<a href="http://39-27.cn/诗44.18.htm">44:18</a>）<br />耶利米书：<br />他们的过犯增多，他们的背离坚定。（耶利米书<a href="http://39-27.cn/耶5.6.htm">5:6</a>）<br />同一先知书：<br />他们使自己背离，不再转回。这百姓使自己背离；耶路撒冷恒久背离，不肯回头。（耶利米书<a href="http://39-27.cn/耶8.4.htm">8:4</a>，<a href="http://39-27.cn/耶8.5.htm">5</a>）<br /><br />他们使自己背离，让自己下去住在深处。（耶利米书<a href="http://39-27.cn/耶49.8.htm">49:8</a>）<br />经上在其它许多经文中也提到了这个词。</p>

For thy people have corrupted themselves. That this signifies that they have completely turned themselves away from the Divine, is evident from the signification of "corrupting one's self," when said 
of worship, as being to turn away from the Divine, for all corruption and transgression in worship are a turning back and away from the Divine. As mention is made of "turning away," a few words shall 
be said about this. All those who are in external things separate from what is internal turn themselves away from the Divine, for they look outward and downward, and not inward and upward. For a man 
looks inward or upward when his internal is open, thus when it is in heaven; but he looks outward or downward when his internal is closed and only his external is open, for this is in the world. Wherefore 
when the external is separated from the internal, the man cannot be raised upward, because that is not present into which heaven should work, for it is closed. From this it is that to all such persons 
the things of heaven and of the church are thick darkness, and therefore these things are not believed by them; but at heart are denied, and with some are denied with the mouth also. [2] When heaven 
works in a man, as is the case when the internal has been opened, it withdraws him from the loves of self and of the world, and from the falsities that spring from this source; because when the 
internal is raised, the external also is raised, for the latter is then kept looking the same way, because it is in subordination. But when on account of its being closed, the internal cannot be raised, 
then the external looks solely toward itself and the world, because the loves of self and of the world then reign. This is also called looking downward, because it is looking to hell, for these loves 
reign there, and the man who is in them is in consociation with those who are there, although he is unaware of it. Moreover, in respect to his interiors he actually turns himself away from the Lord, 
for he turns his back to Him and his face to hell. This cannot be seen in the man while he lives in the body; but as it is his thought and will that do this, it is his spirit which thus turns itself, 
for the spirit is that which thinks and wills in man.  [3] That this is the case is plainly seen in the other life, where spirits turn themselves according to their loves. Those who love the Lord and 
the neighbor look continually to the Lord; nay, wonderful to say, they have Him before the face in every turning of their bodies. For in the spiritual world there are no quarters such as are in the 
natural world; but the quarter there is determined by each person's love, which turns him. But those who love themselves and the world above all things, turn away the face from the Lord, and turn themselves 
to hell, and everyone to those there who are in a similar love with himself, and this likewise in every turning of their bodies. From this it can be seen what is meant by turning one's self away 
from the Divine, and also what is properly signified in the Word by "turning one's self away," as in the following passages: </p>
<p>     They turn themselves backward that trust in graven images (Isa. 42:17).  
    The heart hath turned itself backward (Ps. 44:18).      Their transgressions are multiplied, and their turnings away are made strong (Jer. 5:6).      They turn themselves away, so that they 
do not return; this people turneth itself away, Jerusalem is perpetually turned away; they refuse to return (Jer. 8:4, 5).      They have turned themselves away; into the deep they have let themselves 
down to dwell (Jer. 49:8); </p>
<p>and in many other passages. </p>

<p align="center"><b>Elliott(1983-1999) 10420</b></p><p><b>10420.</b>
'For your people have corrupted themselves' means that they have turned themselves away altogether from the Divine. This is clear from the meaning of 'corrupting themselves', when their worship is the 
subject, as turning themselves away from the Divine; for all corruption and deviation in worship is a departure and turning away from the Divine. Since the expression 'turning away' is used, what is 
implied by it must be stated briefly. Those whose interest lies in external things separated from what is internal all turn themselves away from the Divine; for they look in an outward and downward direction, 
and not in an inward and upward one. For a person looks inwards or upwards when his internal is open, thus when it is in heaven, but he looks outwards or downwards when his internal is closed 
and only his external is open; for his external is located in the world. Consequently when the external has been separated from the internal the person cannot be raised upwards; for the part on which 
heaven must act is unavailable, because it has been closed off. This explains why for those people all things of heaven and the Church dwell in thick darkness, as a result of which also they do not 
believe in the existence of those things. Indeed in their heart they deny the existence of them, some doing so with their lips as well.  </p>
<p></p>
<p><b>[2]</b>
 When heaven acts on a person, which happens when the internal 
is open, it leads him away from self-love and love of the world, and from the falsities welling up from them. When the internal is raised, so too is the external; for the viewpoint of the external 
is similar to that of the internal when it is subordinate to the internal. But when the internal cannot be raised because it is closed, the external looks in no other direction than towards self and 
the world, since self-love and love of the world reign. This is also called looking downwards because it involves looking towards hell, this being the place where those loves reign; and a person ruled 
by those loves lives in company with those inhabiting hell, though he is not conscious of doing so. Also inwardly he in actual fact turns himself away from the Lord; for he turns his back on Him and 
faces towards hell. This cannot be seen within a person while he lives in the body; but since his thought and will are what do this it is his spirit that so turns itself around, the spirit being that 
which thinks and wills within a person. </p>
<p><b>[3]</b>
 It is plainly apparent in the next life that this is so; there spirits turn around as their loves direct them. Those who love the Lord and the neighbour look 
constantly towards the Lord; indeed, amazingly, they are facing Him whichever way they turn their body. For in the spiritual world no direction or quarter exists as in the natural world. The direction 
that anyone in the spiritual world faces is determined by his love causing him to turn around. But those who love themselves and the world above all things turn their face away from the Lord and 
turn themselves towards hell. And there each one turns towards those ruled by a love similar to his, and this too is so whichever way they turn their body. From this it becomes clear what turning oneself 
away from the Divine describes, and also what precisely is meant in the Word by 'turning oneself away', as in Isaiah,  </p>
<blockquote>
They turn themselves away backwards, those trusting in a graven image. <a href="http://bible.gospelcom.net/cgi-bin/bible?passage=Isa%2042:17&amp;version=ESV&amp;interface=print&amp;showfn=yes&amp;showxref">Isa 42:17</a>.  
</blockquote>
<p>In David,  </p>
<blockquote>
[Our] heart does [not] turn itself away backwards. <a href="http://bible.gospelcom.net/cgi-bin/bible?passage=Ps%2044:18&amp;version=ESV&amp;interface=print&amp;showfn=yes&amp;showxref">Ps 44:18</a>.  
</blockquote>
<p>In Jeremiah,  </p>
<p>Their transgressions have been multiplied, and their turnings away have become firm. Jer. 
5:6.  </p>
<p>In the same prophet,  </p>
<blockquote>
They turn themselves away, in order that they may not return. This people turn themselves away; Jerusalem is perpetually turned away, they refuse to return. <a href="http://bible.gospelcom.net/cgi-bin/bible?passage=Jer%208:4,5&amp;version=ESV&amp;interface=print&amp;showfn=yes&amp;showxref">Jer 8:4,5</a>. 
</blockquote>
<p>In the same prophet,  </p>
<blockquote>
They have turned themselves away, they have taken themselves away to dwell in the deep. <a href="http://bible.gospelcom.net/cgi-bin/bible?passage=Jer%2049:8&amp;version=ESV&amp;interface=print&amp;showfn=yes&amp;showxref">Jer 49:8</a>.  
</blockquote>
<p>And the expression is used many times elsewhere.  </p>

`Quia corrupit se populus tuus': quod significet quod prorsus se averterit a Divino, constat ex significatione `corrumpere se' cum de cultu, quod sit avertere se a Divino, nam omnis corruptio et praevaricatio 
in cultu est recessio {1} et aversio a Divino. Quia dicitur aversio, paucis dicetur quomodo cum illa se habet: qui in externis separatis ab interno sunt, illi omnes se a Divino avertunt, spectant 
enim extrorsum et deorsum, et non introrsum et sursum; homo enim {2}spectat introrsum {3}seu sursum cum internum {4}est apertum, ita cum id in caelo est, at {2}spectat extrorsum {3}seu deorsum 
cum internum ejus est clausum, et modo externum {5} apertum, hoc enim in mundo est; quare cum externum separatum {6}ab interno est, homo elevari sursum nequit,  nam id in quod caelum operaturum est, non 
adest, quia est occlusum;  inde est quod omnia caeli et Ecclesiae illis caligo sint; quare etiam ab illis non creduntur, {7}sed negantur corde, a quibusdam etiam ore.  	[2] Caelum cum operatur apud 
hominem, quod fit cum internum   apertum est, abducit illum ab amoribus {8}sui et mundi, et a falsis inde scaturientibus, nam cum internum elevatur, etiam externum elevatur, tenetur enim hoc tunc in 
simili intuitione, quia in subordinatione; at cum internum non elevari potest, quia clausum, tunc externum non spectat {9}alio quam ad se et ad mundum, amores enim sui et mundi regnant; hoc quoque dicitur 
spectare deorsum, quia {5} ad infernum, {10}ibi enim illi amores regnant; (c)ac homo qui in illis est, in consortio cum illis qui ibi, est, tametsi id nescit; {11}etiam quoad interiora sua, actualiter 
se avertit a Domino, vertit enim tergum ad Illum, ac faciem ad infernum; hoc videri in homine cum vivit in corpore, {12}nequit; sed quia cogitatio et voluntas ejus id faciunt, est spiritus ejus 
qui se sic vertit, nam spiritus est qui cogitat et {13} vult in homine; [3] quod ita sit manifeste apparet in altera vita, ibi spiritus se vertunt secundum amores suos; qui Dominum et proximum amant, 
illi continuo spectant ad Dominum, immo, quod mirum, Ipsum ante faciem habent in omni versura corporis eorum; in spirituali enim mundo non est plaga, sicut in naturali mundo, sed plaga ibi determinatur 
ab amore cujusvis qui vertit illum; at qui amant se et mundum super omnia, illi avertunt faciem a Domino ac vertunt se ad infernum, et ibi quisque ad illos qui in simili secum amore sunt, et hoc quoque 
in omni versura corporis eorum; inde constare potest quid sit avertere se a Divino, {14}tum quid proprie significatur {15}per `se avertere' in Verbo, ut apud Esaiam,     	Avertunt se retro confidentes 
sculptili, xlii 17: </p>
<p>apud Davidem, 	[Non] avertit se retro cor, Ps. xliv 19 [A. V. 18]: </p>
<p>apud Jeremiam, 	Multiplicatae sunt praevaricationes eorum, et validae factae  aversiones eorum, v 6: </p>
<p>apud 
eundem, 	Avertunt se, ut non revertantur; avertit se populus hic; Hierosolyma aversa perpetuat, renuunt reverti, viii 4, 5:  apud eundem, 	Averterunt se, in profundum dimiserunt se ad habitandum, 
    xlix 8; </p>
