<h3 align="center" class="ired">属天的奥秘 第1610节</h3>
<h4 align="center"></h4><p><strong>1610.</strong>“我也要使你的种如同地上的尘沙”表无可限量地增多。这是显而易见的，无需解释。此处经上说他的种“如同地上的尘沙”，在圣言的其它地方，有时说如同“海沙”，有时说如同“天上的众星”。这些词语都有各自的含义。“尘沙”论及属天之物，因为如前所述，“尘沙”表爱的属天一面。“海沙”论及属灵之物，因为如前所述，“海”表爱的属灵一面。而“天上的众星”表这二者，只是等级更高。由于这些事物无法数算，故它们就成了用来描述无可限量的生长和增多的习惯说法。<br />他的种（即爱之信，或爱）要无可限量地增多，这句话在至高义上表示主，尤表祂的人性本质；因为就人性本质而言，主被称为“女人的种”（参看<a href="256.htm">256</a>节）。当表示主的人性本质时，“无可限量地增多”这句话的意思是无限的属天和属灵之物；但当表示人类当中的仁之信或仁爱时，这句话的意思是这“种”在过着仁爱生活的每个人里面无可限量地增多，在来生，这“种”增多还会发生在过着仁爱生活的每个人身上。对这样一个人而言，仁爱及其衍生之信，连同它们所具有的幸福如此之大，以至于只能用无可限量和无法形容来描述。当这“种”表示人类时，这“种”的增多在主的国中也是无可限量的，不仅包括教会中人及其子女，还包括教会之外的人及其子女。因此，主的国度和天堂是无穷无尽的。关于这种无穷无尽，蒙主怜悯，我将在别处予以说明。</p><br />

<p><strong>[NCE]1610.</strong> I will make your seed like the dust of the earth means multiplying beyond measure, as can be seen without explanation. This verse says that his seed would be made like the dust of the earth; other passages in the Word say "like the sand of the sea," or "like the stars of the heavens."{*1} Each has its own particular symbolism. The dust of the earth has to do with heavenly qualities, because the earth symbolizes the heavenly aspect of love, as shown earlier [搂搂<a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_1610/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_620" target=_top>620</a>, <a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_1610/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_1413" target=_top>1413</a>, <a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_1610/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_1437" target=_top>1437</a>, <a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_1610/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_1585" target=_top>1585</a>]. The sand of the sea has to do with spiritual qualities, because the sea symbolizes the spiritual aspect of love, as also shown.{*2} "Like the stars of the heavens" symbolizes both, in a higher degree. Because these items are incapable of being counted, it became customary to use them to express the idea of immeasurable reproducing and multiplying.<br />[2] The multiplying of the seed 钬?the faith that comes of love, or love itself 钬?beyond measure symbolizes the Lord in the highest sense. Specifically, it symbolizes his human quality, because the Lord's human quality is called the "seed of a woman," as discussed in 搂<a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_1610/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_256" target=_top>256</a>.{*3} And since the Lord's human quality is meant, multiplication beyond measure means infinite heavenliness and spirituality.<br />On the other hand, when seed symbolizes the faith that comes of charity (or charity itself) in the human race, the meaning is that the seed in each individual who lives a life of charity would multiply beyond measure. This actually happens in the other world to everyone who lives a life of neighborly love. Charity and the faith that results from charity, along with happiness, increase so abundantly in such people that it can be depicted only by something immeasurable and inexpressible.<br />When seed symbolizes the human race itself, its multiplication in the Lord's kingdom is again beyond measure and comes not only from people inside the church and their children but also from people outside the church and their children. As a result, the Lord's kingdom, or heaven, is immeasurable, as will be discussed elsewhere, the Lord in his divine mercy willing.{*4} <br /><strong>Footnotes:</strong><br />{*1} For examples of these star and sand similes, see <a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_1610/bible_king-james-version_genesis_22_17" target=_top>Genesis 22:17</a>; <a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_1610/bible_king-james-version_genesis_26_4" target=_top>26:4</a>; <a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_1610/bible_king-james-version_genesis_32_12" target=_top>32:12</a>; <a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_1610/bible_king-james-version_exodus_32_13" target=_top>Exodus 32:13</a>; <a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_1610/bible_king-james-version_deuteronomy_1_10" target=_top>Deuteronomy 1:10</a>; <a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_1610/bible_king-james-version_1-chronicles_27_23" target=_top>1 Chronicles 27:23</a>; <a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_1610/bible_king-james-version_isaiah_10_22" target=_top>Isaiah 10:22</a>; <a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_1610/bible_king-james-version_hosea_1_10" target=_top>Hosea 1:10</a>; <a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_1610/bible_king-james-version_hebrews_11_12" target=_top>Hebrews 11:12</a>.

I will make thy seed as the dust of the earth. That this signifies multiplication immeasurably, is evident without explication. It is here said that his seed should be made "as the dust of the earth;" 
in other places in the Word, "as the sand of the sea," and in others, "as the stars of the heavens." Each expression has its own peculiar signification. "The dust of the earth" refers to things that 
are celestial, for "the earth," as before shown, signifies the celestial of love. "The sand of the sea" refers to things that are spiritual; for "the sea," as has also been shown, signifies the spiritual 
of love. "As the stars of the heavens" signifies both of these, in a higher degree; and as none of these things can be numbered, it became a customary form of speaking to express by them immeasurable 
fructification and multiplication.  
 </p>
<p>[2] That his seed (that is, the faith of love, or love) should be immeasurably multiplied, in the supreme sense, signifies the Lord, and in fact His Human Essence; 
for the Lord as to His Human Essence was called "the Seed of the woman" (see n. 256). And when the Lord's Human Essence is signified, by immeasurable multiplication is meant the infinite celestial 
and spiritual; but when the faith of charity, or charity, in the human race, is signified by "seed," it is meant that this seed in each one who lives in charity is immeasurably multiplied; as also 
comes to pass in the other life, with everyone who lives in charity. With such a one, charity and the derivative faith, and, together with these, happiness, are multiplied to such a degree, that it can 
only be described as immeasurable, and beyond words. When by "seed" there is signified the human race, the multiplication of this in the Lord's Kingdom is also immeasurable, not only from those who 
are within the church and their children, but also from those who are without the church and their children. Hence the kingdom of the Lord, or heaven, is immeasurable. Concerning its immensity, of the 
Lord's Divine mercy more will be said elsewhere. </p>

<p align="center"><b>Elliott(1983-1999) 1610</b></p><p><b>1610.</b>
That 'I will make your seed as the dust of the earth' means being multiplied beyond measure is clear without explanation. Here it is said that his seed would be made as 'the dust of the earth', in other 
parts of the Word as 'the dust of the sea', and in yet other parts as 'the stars of heaven'. Each of these phrases has its own particular meaning. 'Dust of the earth' has regard to those things that 
are celestial, for, as shown already, 'the earth' means the celestial aspect of love; 'dust of the sea' has regard to those things that are spiritual, for 'the sea', as has also been shown, means the 
spiritual aspect of love; while 'as the stars of heaven' means both but in a higher degree. And because these things cannot be numbered they therefore became common expressions to describe growth and 
multiplication beyond measure. </p>
<p></p>
<p><b>[2]</b>
 The statement that his seed, that is, the faith that is the expression of love, or simply love, was to be multiplied beyond measure means in the highest sense 
the Lord, and in particular His Human Essence, for the Lord as regards the Human Essence is called 'the seed of the woman', dealt with in <a href="256.htm">256</a>. When the Lord's Human Essence is meant, the infinite celestial 
and spiritual is understood by the words 'multiplied beyond measure'; but when faith that is the expression of charity, or simply charity, among the human race is meant by 'the seed', the multiplication 
without measure of that seed in everyone who leads a charitable life is understood. Such multiplication takes place in the next life with everyone who leads a charitable life. With him the multiplication 
of charity and of the faith deriving from it, together with their associated happiness, is so great that one can only describe it as being beyond measure and defying description. When the 
human race is meant by 'the seed', the multiplication of this in the Lord's kingdom is also beyond measure- not only from those who are inside the Church, and their children, but also from those who 
are outside the Church, and their children. Consequently the Lord's kingdom or heaven is boundless. That boundlessness will in the Lord's Divine mercy be spoken of elsewhere. </p>

'Ponam semen tuum sicut pulverem terrae': quod significat multiplicationem in immensum, constat absque explicatione; hic dicitur quod poneretur semen sicut 'pulvis terrae'; alibi in Verbo sicut 'pulvis 
maris'; alibi sicut 'stellae caelorum'; unumquodvis suam peculiarem significationem habet; 'pulvis terrae' spectat illa quae sunt caelestia, nam terra, ut ostensum prius, significat caeleste amoris, 
'pulvis maris' spectat illa quae sunt spiritualia, nam 'mare,' ut quoque ostensum, significat spirituale amoris; 'sicut stellae caelorum' significat utrumque in superiore gradu; quae quia innumerabilia 
sunt, facta inde formula sollemnis per illa exprimere fructificationem et multiplicationem in immensum.  [2] Quod semen multiplicaretur in immensum, hoc est fides amoris seu amor, in supremo sensu 
significat Dominum, et quidem Humanam Ipsius Essentiam, nam Dominus quoad Humanam Essentiam appellatur 'semen mulieris,' de quo n. 256; et cum Humana Domini Essentia, intelligitur per multiplicationem 
in immensum, infinitum caeleste et spirituale: cum autem per semen significatur fides charitatis seu charitas in genere humano, intelligitur quod semen in unoquovis qui in charitate vivit, multiplicaretur 
in immensum; quod etiam fit apud unumquemvis qui in charitate vivit, in altera vita; apud illum tantum multiplicatur charitas et inde fides et cum his felicitas ut non nisi quam per immensum et 
ineffabile describi possit; cum per semen significatur genus humanum, ejus multiplicatio in regno Domini etiam in immensum est, non solum ex illis qui intra Ecclesiam sunt et eorum infantibus sed etiam 
ex illis qui extra Ecclesiam et eorum infantibus; inde regnum Domini seu caelum est immensum, de cujus immensitate, ex Divina Domini Misericordia, alibi dicetur. </p>
