<h3 align="center" class="ired">属天的奥秘 第1005节</h3>
<h4 align="center"></h4><p><strong>1005.</strong>“追讨你们的血和灵魂”表施加给仁爱的暴行会招致惩罚，“血”表暴行，“灵魂”表施暴的人。这从上下文，以及“血”和“灵魂”的反面意义清楚可知。首先，从上文来看，前一节论述了吃血，吃血表亵渎，如前所述；其次，从下文来看，下一节论述了流血；故显而易见，此处的主题是凡混和圣洁之物与不洁之物者的状态，以及对他的惩罚。这从“血”的反面意义进一步清楚可知，因为“血”的真正含义表属天之物，涉及重生的属灵之人时，则表仁爱，也就是他的属天之物；但“血”的反义表施加给仁爱的暴行，因而表违背仁爱之物，即一切仇恨、报复、残忍，尤其亵渎，这从前面（<a href="374.htm">374</a>，<a href="376.htm">376</a>节）所引用的圣言明显看出来。最后，从“灵魂”的反义来看，在圣言中，“灵魂”一般表生命，因而表一切活着的人，但由于人如何，其生命也如何，故它也表实施暴行的人，这一点可通过圣言多处经文得以证实，不过，在此仅引用摩西五经中的一段：<br />倘若有吃血的，我必向那吃血的灵魂变脸，把他从他的民中剪除；<br />因为肉身的灵魂是在血中；我把这血赐给你们，可以在坛上为你们的灵魂赎罪，因血本身有灵魂，所以能赎罪。（利未记<a href="http://39-27.cn/利17.10.htm">17:10</a>-<a href="http://39-27.cn/利17.11.htm">11</a>，<a href="http://39-27.cn/利17.14.htm">14</a>）<br />此处“灵魂”表具有三重意义的生命，如它在别处经常表示的。施加给仁爱的暴行会招致惩罚，这从下文明显可知。</p>

<p><strong>[NCE]1005.</strong> Seeking the blood of your souls means that the violence inflicted on charity will inevitably punish itself, the blood meaning violence, and souls meaning that which inflicts the violence. This can be seen from statements above and below; from the symbolism of blood in the negative sense; and from the symbolism of a soul in the negative sense.<br />From statements above: The last verse dealt with the eating of blood, which symbolizes profanation, as was shown.<br />From statements below: The next verse deals with the shedding of blood. The present verse, then, is about the condition and punishment of those who combine sacred things with profane.<br />From the symbolism of blood in the negative sense: In a positive sense blood symbolizes heavenly traits and, in respect to a regenerate spiritual person, charity (which is spiritual people's heavenly side); but in its negative sense blood symbolizes the violence inflicted on charity. Accordingly it symbolizes the opposite of charity and therefore all hatred, all vengefulness, all cruelty, and especially profanation, as the passages from the Word quoted in <a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_1005/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_374" target=_top>374</a> and <a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_1005/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_376" target=_top>376</a> indicate.<br />From the symbolism of a soul in the negative sense: In the Word, a soul generally symbolizes life and so all living people. Our character, though, determines what kind of life we live, so a soul also symbolizes the person who inflicts violence. Many passages in the Word are capable of demonstrating this, but for the moment take just this one from Moses:<br />Whoever may have eaten blood, I will set my face against the souls eating blood, and I will cut them off from the midst of their people, because the soul of the flesh is in the blood. And I have given it [for use] on the altar, to make atonement over your souls, because the blood itself must atone for the soul. (<a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_1005/bible_king-james-version_leviticus_17_10-11" target=_top>Leviticus 17:10-11</a>, <a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_1005/bible_king-james-version_leviticus_17_14" target=_top>14</a>)<br />This passage uses soul to mean life in three senses.{*1} Many other passages also [demonstrate these senses].{*2} What follows [<a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_1005/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_1011" target=_top>1011-1012</a>] will show that the violence inflicted on charity inevitably punishes itself.<br /><br /><strong>Footnotes:</strong><br />{*1} In the passage, "soul" refers variously to a person ("the souls eating blood"), the physical life carried by the blood ("the soul of the flesh"), and the human soul ("to make atonement over your souls"). [LHC]<br />{*2} For a sizeable collection of biblical passages that use the word "soul," sorted according to their inner meanings, see Revelation Explained (Swedenborg 1994-1997a) <a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_1005/swedenborg_apocalypse-explained-whitehead_750" target=_top>750</a>.

And surely your blood with your souls will I require. That this signifies that violence inflicted upon charity will punish itself, and that "blood" is violence, and "souls" they who inflict violence, 
is evident from what precedes and what follows, as also from the signification of "blood" in the opposite sense, and from the signification of "soul" in the opposite sense. From what precedes, because 
in the preceding verse the eating of blood is treated of, by which is signified profanation, as has been shown. From what follows, as the next verse treats of the shedding of blood; and therefore here 
the subject is the state and punishment of him who mingles what is sacred with what is profane. From the signification of "blood" in the opposite sense, because in the genuine sense "blood" signifies 
what is celestial, and in reference to the regenerate spiritual man charity, which is his celestial; but in the opposite sense "blood" signifies violence inflicted upon charity, consequently what is 
contrary to charity, and therefore all hatred, revenge, cruelty, and especially profanation, as may be seen from the passages in the Word cited above (n. 374, 376). From the signification of "soul" 
in the opposite sense, since "soul" in the Word signifies in general life, thus every man who lives; but since such as man is such is his life, it signifies also the man who brings violence, as may be 
confirmed by many passages from the Word, but here only by this from Moses: </p>
<p>     He that eateth blood, I will set My faces against the soul that eateth blood, and I will cut it off from among his people; 
for the soul of the flesh is in the blood; and I have given it to you upon the altar to make atonement for your souls; for it is the blood that will make atonement for the soul (Lev. 17:10-11, 14). Here 
the "soul" denotes the life in a threefold sense, as often elsewhere. That violence inflicted upon charity will bring punishment on itself, will be evident from what follows. </p>

<p align="center"><b>Elliott(1983-1999) 1005</b></p><p><b>1005.</b>
That 'requiring your blood with your souls' means that violence done to charity will punish itself, 'blood' meaning violence, and 'souls' people who do violence, is clear from what comes before and after, 
and also from the meaning of 'blood' in the contrary sense, as well as from the meaning of 'soul' in the contrary sense. First from what comes before in the previous verse referring to the eating 
of blood, which, as shown, meant profanation, and from what comes after in the next verse referring to the shedding of blood, it is consequently clear that the subject here is the state and the punishment 
of one who mixes holy things with unholy. It is further clear from the meaning of 'blood' in the contrary sense, in that 'blood' in the genuine sense means that which is celestial and in reference 
to a regenerate spiritual person means charity - which constitutes the celestial in his case - but in the contrary sense means violence done to charity, and therefore that which is contrary to charity, 
namely all hatred, all revenge, all cruelty, and especially profanation, as becomes clear from the places in the Word that are quoted in <a href="374.htm">374</a> and <a href="376.htm">376</a>. Finally it is clear from the meaning of 'soul' 
in the contrary sense, in that in the Word 'soul' means life, in general, and so everybody who lives, but also means, since a person's life is by nature what he himself is, any individual who does 
violence. This may be confirmed from many parts of the Word, but for the moment let solely the following from Moses do so, </p>
<blockquote>
He who eats blood, I will set My face<A name="fntext1"></a><A href="#fn1"><sup>a</sup></a> against the soul eating blood, and 
I will cut him off from among his people, for the soul of the flesh is in the blood, and I have given it upon the altar, to make atonement for your souls, for the blood itself will make atonement by reason 
of the soul. <a href="http://bible.gospelcom.net/cgi-bin/bible?passage=Lev%2017:10,%2011,%2014&amp;version=ESV&amp;interface=print&amp;showfn=yes&amp;showxref">Lev 17:10, 11, 14</a>. 
</blockquote>
<p>Here 'soul' stands for life in three different senses, as it does many times elsewhere. The fact that violence done to charity will punish itself will be clear 
from what follows.

Quod 'sanguinem vestrum animabus vestris quaerere' significet quod violentia illata charitati se punitura, et quod 'sanguis' sit violentia, et 'animae' sint quae violentiam inferunt, constat a praecedentibus 
et a sequentibus, tum a significatione 'sanguinis' in sensu contrario, et a significatione 'animae' etiam in sensu contrario; ab iis quae praecedunt agitur in versu praecedenti de esu sanguinis, 
quo significata profanatio, ut ostensum; a sequentibus agitur in versu mox sequenti de effusione sanguinis; quare hic de statu et punitione ejus qui commiscet sancta profanis; a significatione sanguinis 
in sensu contrario: 'sanguis' in genuino sensu significat caeleste, et respective ad hominem regeneratum spiritualem significat charitatem, quae ejus caeleste est; at in contrario sensu significat 
sanguis violentiam illatam charitati, proinde quod contrarium charitati est, ita omne odium, omnem vindictam, omnem crudelitatem, imprimis profanationem ut constare potest ab illis in Verbo locis 
quae allata sunt n. 374 et 376 a significatione animae in sensu contrario: 'anima' in Verbo significat in genere vitam, ita omnem hominem qui vivit; sed qualis homo tali vita, ita quoque eum hominem 
qui violentiam infert, quod multis confirmari a Verbo potest, solum nunc per hoc quod apud Mosen, 	Qui comederit sanguinem, dabo facies Meas contra animam comedentem sanguinem, et exscindam eam e medio 
populi ejusquia anima carnis in sanguine illa, et Ego dedi illum super altare ad expiandum super animas vestras, quia sanguis ipse pro anima expiabit, Lev. xvii 10, 11, 14, ubi 'anima' pro vita in 
triplici sensu, praeter multoties alibi. Quod violentia illata charitati semet punitura, constabit ab iis quae sequuntur. </p>
