<h3 align="center" class="ired">属天的奥秘 第2307节</h3>
<h4 align="center"></h4><p><strong>2307.</strong>我曾就小孩子的问题询问天使，他们是否从恶中洁净，毕竟他们没有像成人那样实际作恶。但我被告知，他们同样处在恶中，甚至全然是恶。只是主将他们保守在良善当中，脱离邪恶，和其他天使一样，以致他们觉得仿佛是凭自己处于良善。因此，为避免他们在天堂长大以后对自己抱有错误的认知，以为他们里面的良善是出于自己，而非出于主，主不时让他们回到自己因遗传所禀承的邪恶之中，直到他们认识、承认、信服事实的确如所说的那样。有一个在世夭折在天堂长大的孩子，就有这种类似观点。于是，他被带回与生俱来的罪恶生命中。那时，我从他的气场得以发觉，他有一种主宰他人的倾向，而且视淫乱为无关紧要之事；这些都是他遗传自父母的罪恶。等他认清了自己的秉性，又被接入之前所在的天使群当中。</p>

Concerning little children I have inquired of the angels whether they are pure from evils, seeing that they have no actual evil, as adults have. But I was told that they are equally in evil; nay, that 
they too are nothing but evil; but that they, like all the angels, are withheld from evil and are kept in good by the Lord, insomuch that it appears to them as if they were in good from themselves. 
And therefore also the little children, after they have become adults in heaven, in order to prevent them from being of the false opinion regarding themselves that the good in them is from themselves, 
and not from the Lord, are sometimes remitted into their evils which they have received by inheritance, and are left in them until they know, acknowledge, and believe, that the truth is as has been said. 
A certain one also who had died when an infant, but had grown up in heaven, was of a similar opinion; and therefore he was remitted into the life of the evils inborn in him, and it was then given 
me to perceive from his sphere that he had a disposition to domineer over others, and that he esteemed lascivious things as of no account; which were evils that he had inherited from his parents. But 
after he had acknowledged that such was his nature, he was again received among the angels with whom he had been before. </p>

I have spoken to angels about young children, whether these are free from evils since no evil of their own doing clings to them as it does to adults. But I have been told that they are just as much immersed 
in evil; indeed that they too are nothing but evil, but that as with all angels they are withheld from evil and maintained by the Lord in good, so much so that it seems to them as though they 
abode in good from themselves. This also is why, after young children have become adult in heaven, they are sometimes allowed to return to their evils which they acquired by heredity- lest any false notion 
should exist in them that good with them is derived from themselves and not from the Lord; and they are left immersed in those evils until they come to know, acknowledge, and believe that the truth 
is as has just been indicated. A certain person also who had died as a young child but who had grown up in heaven possessed a similar notion and was therefore taken back to the life of evils that 
was innate within him. At this point I was given to perceive from his sphere that he had an inclination to dominate others and that he thought nothing of lustful acts, which were evils that he possessed 
by heredity from his parents. But after he acknowledged that such was his character he was received back again among the angels with whom he had been previously. </p>

</p><b>2307.</b>
Locutus cum angelis de infantibus, num puri sint a malis, quia illis nullum actuale malum sicut adultis; sed dictum mihi quod illi aeque malo sint, immo quod illi quoque nihil nisi malum sint, sed quod 
ii, sic' omnes angeli, detineantur a malo et teneantur in bono a Domino usque adeo ut appareat iis sicut in bono ex se sint; quare etiam infantes postquam adulti facti in caelo, ne in falsa opinione 
de se sint quod bonum apud eos sit ex iis et non ex Domino, remittuntur quandoque in mala sua quae hereditario acceperunt, et in illis relinquuntur usque dum sciunt, agnoscunt et credunt quod ita se 
habeat.  Quidam etiam qui infans mortuus, sed qui adolevit in caelo in simili opinione fuit, quare in vitam malorum sibi innatam remissus, et tunc percipere mihi datum ex sphaera ejus quod animum haberet 
imperandi aliis et quod lasciva pro nihilo aestimaret, quae fuerunt mala ei hereditario ex parentibus; at postquam agnovit quod talis esset, tunc iterum receptus inter angelos inter quos prius fuit. </p>
