<h3 align="center" class="ired">属天的奥秘 第8006节</h3>
<h4 align="center"></h4><p><strong>8006.</strong>“以色列全会众都要守这礼”表这秩序的律法是为所有处于真理之良善和良善之真理的人立的。这从“以色列会众”的含义清楚可知，“以色列会众”是指在一个整体中的所有真理和良善（参看<a href="7830.htm">7830</a>节），因而是指那些处于引向良善的真理之人，以及那些处于真理到来所经由的良善之人（<a href="7957.htm">7957</a>节），进而指那些属于属灵教会的人。所有这些人都要守逾越节，这是为了叫他们能代表那些属于属灵教会，滞留在低地直到主也也降临之人的释放（<a href="6854.htm">6854</a>，<a href="6914.htm">6914</a>，<a href="7091.htm">7091</a>e，<a href="7849.htm">7849</a>，<a href="7932.htm">7932</a>节）；他们在一个房子里一起吃代表天上彼此生活在一起的天使的组合（<a href="7836.htm">7836</a>，<a href="7996.htm">7996</a>，<a href="7997.htm">7997</a>节）；因此，守这礼的以色列全会众代表整个天堂。那时，到处没有一个教会，只有一个教会的代表，亚伯拉罕经由雅各这一支被拣选就是了这个教会的代表。与天堂，并由经由天堂与主的联系便通过教会的代表得以建立。这就是为何这个民族被吩咐要严格遵守所有条例、所有律法，尤其关于逾越节的条例，并且如此严厉，以致那洁净而不守逾越节的人要被剪除（民数记<a href="http://39-27.cn/民9.13.htm">9:13</a>）。</p>

All the assemblage of Israel shall perform it. That this signifies that this law of order is for all who are in the good of truth and in the truth of good, is evident from the signification of "the assemblage 
of Israel," as being all truths and goods in one complex (see n. 7830); thus those who are in the truth through which is good, and those who are in the good through which is truth (n. 7957), 
consequently those who are of the spiritual church. That all these were to perform the passover, was to represent the liberation of those of the spiritual church who had been detained in the lower earth 
until the Lord's coming (n. 6854, 6914, 7091, 7849, 7932); their eating together in one house was to represent the angelic consociations in heaven (n. 7836, 7996, 7997); thus by the whole assemblage 
of Israel performing it was represented the whole heaven. At that time there was nowhere a church, but only the representative of a church, for which were taken the descendants of Abraham from Jacob. 
Communication with heaven, and through heaven with the Lord, was given by means of the representatives of the church. For this reason it was enjoined upon that nation to strictly observe all the statutes 
and all the laws, especially the statutes concerning the passover, insomuch that he who was clean and did not perform the passover was to be cut off (Num. 9:13). </p>

<p align="center"><b>Elliott(1983-1999) 8006</b></p><p><b>8006.</b>
'All the assembly of Israel shall keep it' means that this law of order is for all who are governed by the good of truth and guided by the truth of good. This is clear from the meaning of 'the assembly 
of Israel' as all truths and forms of good in their entirety, <a href="7830.htm">7830</a>, thus those who are guided by truth that leads to good, and governed by good through which truth comes, <a href="7957.htm">7957</a>, consequently those who 
belong to the spiritual Church. They were all required to keep the Passover in order that they might represent the deliverance of those belonging to the spiritual Church who were held back on the lower 
earth until the Lord's Coming, <a href="6854.htm">6854</a>, <a href="6914.htm">6914</a>, <a href="7091.htm">7091</a> (end), <a href="7849.htm">7849</a>, <a href="7932.htm">7932</a>; and their eating it 'in one house' represented groups of angels living in association with one another in heaven,<a href="7836.htm">7836</a>, <a href="7996.htm">7996</a>, <a href="7997.htm">7997</a>, 
so that the keeping of it by the whole assembly of Israel represented the whole of heaven. At that time the Church did not exist anywhere, only a representative of the Church, for which Abraham's descendants 
through Jacob were selected. Through representatives of the Church contact with heaven was established, and through heaven with the Lord. This was why that nation was commanded to maintain 
a strict observance of all statutes and all laws, above all the statutes relating to the Passover, so strict that anyone who was clean and did not keep the Passover was to be cut off, <a href="http://bible.gospelcom.net/cgi-bin/bible?passage=Num%209:13&amp;version=ESV&amp;interface=print&amp;showfn=yes&amp;showxref">Num 9:13</a>. </p>

`Omnis coetus Israelis facient illud': quod significet quod ea lex ordinis omnibus qui in bono veri et in vero boni, constat ex significatione `coetus Israelis' quod sint omnia vera et bona in uno complexu, 
n. 7830, ita qui in vero per quod bonum, et in bono per quod verum, n. (x)7957, proinde qui ab Ecclesia spirituali.  Quod `omnes illi facerent Paesach' erat ut repraesentarent liberationem illorum 
qui ab Ecclesia spirituali in inferiore terra usque ad Adventum Domini detenti sunt, n. 6854, 6914, 7091 fin., (x)7849, 7932; {1}et per `(x)comessationem in una domo' {2} consociationes angelicas
