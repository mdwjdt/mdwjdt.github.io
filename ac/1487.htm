<h4 align="center"></h4><p><strong>1487.</strong>“耶和华降大灾与法老”表记忆的知识被摧毁。这从“法老”的含义清楚可知，“法老”一般表知识，因此表构成那知识的记忆；从“降大灾”表被摧毁的含义也可知。至于记忆的知识，情况是这样：它们是童年时仅仅为了知道而获得的；对主而言，它们是通过对真理的情感出于快乐获得的。童年所获得的记忆知识非常多，但主都将它们安排得井然有序，以便它们能服务于用；首先，能使人思考；然后，它们藉着思考而有用处；最后是为了这一切能奏效，也就是说，他的真生命就在于用，是用的生命。这些就是童年获得的记忆知识所产生的事物；没有它们，外在人永远无法与内在人结合，同时变成用。当人变成用时，即当他通过用的目的思考一切（即便不是凭明显的思考，也会凭通过明显思考所获得的性情而进行的默想），并为了用的目的而做一切时，已起到第一个作用，就是使人变得理性的记忆知识由于不再有用，就会被摧毁，依此类推。这些就是此处“耶和华降大灾与法老”这句话所表示的事物。</p><br />

<p><strong>[NCE]1487.</strong> Jehovah struck Pharaoh with great plagues means that facts were destroyed, as can be seen from the following: Pharaoh symbolizes learning in general and consequently the facts learned. And being struck with plagues symbolizes being destroyed.<br />This is how it is with facts: While we are young we accumulate them for the sole purpose of knowing them. In the Lord's case, the motivation was the pleasure he felt in truth and the love he had for it.<br />The facts we collect in youth are very plentiful, but the Lord organizes them properly so that they can serve a use; they enable us first to think, then to figure out how we can put facts to use, and finally to become embodiments of usefulness ourselves. (This happens when our life itself consists in being useful, when our life is one of useful activity.) These functions are performed by the facts we absorb in our youth. Without facts, our external self could never unite with our inner self and in the process become truly useful. Some people do come to embody usefulness; in other words, they view everything in terms of its use and direct all their action toward a useful goal. Perhaps they do not reflect explicitly on the question of usefulness, but still they do so tacitly, by second nature. With these people, factual knowledge has filled its first function, which is to make them rational, and the facts are then destroyed, because they no longer have a purpose; and so on from there.<br />This is what the present verse means when it says that Jehovah struck Pharaoh with great plagues. </p>

And Jehovah smote Pharaoh with great plagues. That this signifies that the memory-knowledges were destroyed, is evident from the signification of "Pharaoh," as being memory-knowledge in general, consequently 
the memory-knowledges that belong to such knowledge; and from the signification of being "smitten with plagues," as being to be destroyed. As regards memory-knowledges the case is this. In childhood 
they are acquired for no other end than that of knowing; with the Lord, they were acquired from the delights and affection of truth. The memory-knowledges acquired in childhood are very numerous, 
but are disposed by the Lord into order so as to serve for use; first, to give the ability to think; then that they may be of use by means of thought; and lastly that this may take effect, that is 
to say that the very life may consist in use, and be a life of uses. These are the things performed by the memory-knowledges that are acquired in childhood; and without them the external man can never 
be conjoined with the internal, and at the same time become use. When man becomes use, that is, when he thinks all things from the end of use, and does all things for the end of use-if not by manifest 
reflection, still by tacit reflection from a nature acquired by so doing-then the memory-knowledges which have served the first use-that the man may become rational-being no longer of service, are 
destroyed; and so on. These are the things here meant by the words "Jehovah smote Pharaoh with great plagues." </p>

<p align="center"><b>Elliott(1983-1999) 1487</b></p><p><b>1487.</b>
That 'Jehovah struck Pharaoh with great plagues' means that facts were destroyed is clear from the meaning of 'Pharaoh' as knowledge in general, and therefore as the facts that constitute that knowledge, 
and from the meaning of 'being struck by plagues' as being destroyed. With regard to facts, these are acquired in childhood with no other end in view than that of knowing. In the Lord's case they 
were acquired out of delights in and affection for truth. The facts that are acquired in childhood are very many indeed, but the Lord arranges them into order, so that they may serve a use - first to 
enable the person to think; then so that through his thinking those facts may be of use; and at length so that the following may be accomplished, namely, that his very life may consist in use and be 
a life of uses. These are the things effected by the facts which he absorbs in childhood. Without them his external man could not possibly be joined to the internal and at the same time become use incarnate. 
When a person becomes such, that is, when all that he thinks stems from use as an end and all that he does is for the sake of use - if not by reflecting openly yet by doing so silently from a 
disposition acquired from reflecting openly - the facts which have served the first use, that a person may become rational, are now destroyed since they serve no further use; and so on with other facts 
and the uses they serve. These are the things meant here by the statement 'Jehovah struck Pharaoh with great plagues'. </p>

<p align="center"><b>Latin(1748-1756) 1487</b>
</p><b>1487.</b>
Quod 'percussit Jehovah Pharaonem plagis magnis' significet quod destructa sint scientifica, constat ex significatione 'Pharaonis' quod sit scientia in communi, proinde scientifica quae sunt scientiae; 
et ex significatione 'percuti plagis' quod sit destrui: ita se habet cum scientificis: comparantur in pueritia non alio fine quam fine sciendi, apud Dominum ex deliciis et affectione veri: scientifica 
quae in pueritia comparantur sunt perplura, sed disponuntur a Domino in ordinem ut inserviant usui, primum ut cogitare possit, dein ut usui per cogitationem sint, tandem ut fiat, nempe ut ipsa ejus 
vita consistat in usu, sitque vita usuum; haec praestant scientifica quae haurit in pueritia; absque illis nusquam externus ejus homo conjungi potest cum interno, et simul fieri usus; cum homo fit 
usus, hoc est, dum omnia cogitat, ex fine usus, et omnia facit ob finem usus, si non per manifestam reflexionem, usque per tacitam ex indole inde acquisita, tunc scientifica quae inserviverunt primo usui 
ut rationalis fiat, destruuntur, quia non amplius magis inserviunt, et sic porro: haec sunt quae hic intelliguntur per quod 'Jehovah percussit Pharaonem plagis magnis.' </p>
