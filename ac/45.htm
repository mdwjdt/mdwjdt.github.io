<h3 align="center" class="ired">属天的奥秘 第45节</h3>
<h4 align="center"></h4><p><strong>45.</strong>上古时代的人即以此象征觉性和意志，故在先知书乃至整部旧约圣经中，各种动物皆具有对应的象征义。动物可分两类，一为恶（因具危险性），一为善（因温驯）。前者如熊、狼、狗，象征人内在的邪恶，后者如牛犊、绵羊、羊羔，象征人内在的良善、温柔。此处既论述重生之人，故所言动物皆象征良善、温柔的情感。肉体的低级趣味被称为地上的“走兽”，表人的欲望和快感。</p>

<p><strong>[NCE]45.</strong> People who lived in the earliest times used the same kinds of symbols for the contents of the intellect and the will. In consequence, the different types of creature have a similar representation in the prophets and throughout the Old Testament Word.<br />Beasts are of two kinds: bad (because they are dangerous) and good (because they are tame). Bad animals — bears, wolves, and [feral] dogs, for instance — symbolize evil things in us. Good animals — young cattle, sheep, lambs — symbolize the good, gentle things in us. Because the present theme concerns people who are being reborn, the beasts in this verse are the good, tame ones, symbolizing feelings of affection.<br />The traits in us that belong to a lower order and rise more out of our body are called the wild animals of the earth; they are cravings and appetites.{*1} <br /><strong>Footnotes:</strong><br />{*1} On the meaning of the reference to those traits that arise out of the body, see note 2 in <a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_45/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_8" target=_top>8</a>. The important point is that the cravings and appetites Swedenborg refers to here may include such nonphysical yearnings as a desire for honor, privilege, and power. [SS] </p>
<p align="center"><b>Potts(1905-1910) 45</b></p><p><b>45.</b>
Those who lived in the most ancient times thus signified the things relating to the understanding and to the will; and therefore in the Prophets, and constantly in the Word of the Old Testament, the 
like things are represented by different kinds of animals. Beasts are of two kinds; the evil, so called because they are hurtful; and the good, which are harmless. Evils in man are signified by evil beasts, 
as by bears, wolves, dogs; and the things which are good and gentle, by beasts of a like nature, as by heifers, sheep, and lambs. The "beasts" here referred to are good and gentle ones, and thus 
signify affections, because it here treats of those who are being regenerated. The lower things in man, which have more connection with the body, are called "wild animals of that earth" and are cupidities 
and pleasures. </p>

<p align="center"><b>Elliott(1983-1999) 45</b></p><p><b>45.</b>
This was how people who lived in most ancient times envisaged matters of the understanding and those of the will. Among the Prophets therefore, and consistently throughout the Old Testament Word, like 
matters are represented by various kinds of living creatures. There are two kinds of beasts - evil ones, because they are harmful, and good ones, because they are gentle. Evil [and harmful] things in 
man were meant by such beasts as bears, wolves, and dogs, while good and gentle things were meant by beasts such as calves, sheep, and lambs. As the subject here is those persons who are to be regenerated, 
'the beasts' are good and gentle ones, which mean affections. Things of a baser nature that derive from the body are called 'wild animals of the earth'. These are desires and pleasures.

</p><b>45.</b>
Qui antiquissimis temporibus vixerunt, ita significarunt illa quae sunt intellectus et quae sunt voluntatis; inde apud Prophetas et constanter in Verbo Veteris Testamenti similia per animalium genera 
repraesentantur. Bestiae sunt duplicis generis, sunt malae quia noxiae et sunt bonae quia mites; quae mala sunt in homine, significata sunt per tales bestias ut per 'ursos, lupos, canes'; quae bona 
et mitia, per tales quoque bestias sicut per 'juvencos, oves et agnos'; bestiae, quia hic agitur de regenerandis, sunt bonae et mites, significant affectiones: quae inferiora sunt, et plus trahunt a corpore, 
vocantur 'ferae ejus terrae' et sunt cupiditates et voluptates. </p>
