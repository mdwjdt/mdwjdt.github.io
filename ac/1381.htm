<h4 align="center"></h4><p><strong>1381.</strong>灵魂和灵人若尚未在大人中被指定固定位置，会被带到各个地方：时而在这里，时而在那里；时而在这边被看到，时而在那边被看到，时而在上，时而又在下。他们被称为游荡的灵魂或灵人，好比人体内的液体，体液有时从胃部涌入头部，有时涌入其它部位，并被带到各处。这就是这些灵人在达到与其总体状态一致的指定地方和位置之前的情形。正是他们的状态以这种方式发生改变并游荡。</p>

<p><strong>[NCE]1381.</strong> Souls and spirits who have not yet been allotted a permanent position in the universal human travel to different places, now here, now there; now they appear on one side and now on another; now up, now down. They are called roaming souls or spirits and resemble fluids in the human body that travel from the stomach, at one moment into the head, at another to other places, and remain on the move.{*1} That is how these spirits act before they arrive at their designated place — a place suited to their overall state. It is their state that changes and wanders in this way.<br /><br /><strong>Footnotes:</strong><br />{*1} Apparently the "fluids ... that travel from the stomach" are the digested constituents of food that flow through the bloodstream. The spirits described here may be those mentioned in <a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_1381/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_5173" target=_top>5173-5174</a>; in an extended analog to human bodily processes, they are purified and become chyle, a fatty liquid that is drawn off the food passing through the intestines, then move from there into the blood and thus throughout the body. See also the further discussion of the spirits that correspond to the stomach of the universal human in <a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_1381/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_5175" target=_top>5175-5179</a>; Spiritual Experiences (Swedenborg 1998-2002) <a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_1381/swedenborg_spiritual-experiences-odhner_1021" target=_top>1021-1022</a>, <a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_1381/swedenborg_spiritual-experiences-odhner_1033" target=_top>1033-1035</a>, <a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_1381/swedenborg_spiritual-experiences-odhner_1742" target=_top>1742</a>.

The souls and spirits who have not as yet been allotted a constant situation in the Grand Man, are carried to various places, now to this, now to that; now are seen on one side, now on another; now above, 
now below. These are called wandering souls or spirits, and are comparable to the fluids in the human body, which rise up from the stomach, sometimes to the head, sometimes to other parts, and are 
carried about. So is it with these spirits, until they come to their designated place, and to a situation in conformity with their general state. It is their states that are thus changed, and that 
are wandering. </p>

Souls and spirits who have not yet been allotted a permanent position in the Grand Man are conveyed to different places - now this way, now that - and are seen now on one side and now on another, above 
or below. They are called wandering souls or spirits and are compared to the fluids in the human body that surge up from the stomach, sometimes into the head, sometimes into other parts, and are carried 
around. This is what happens to these spirits before they reach the appointed place and position in keeping with their own general state. It is their states which alter and wander in this fashion. </p>

</p><b>1381.</b>
Animae et spiritus qui nondum constantem situm in Maximo Homine sortiti sunt, feruntur ad varia loca, nunc huc nunc illuc, nunc videntur ad latus unum nunc ad aliud, nunc supra nunc infra; vocantur 
animae seu spiritus errantes, et comparantur fluidis in corpore humano quae ex ventriculo assurgunt, quandoque in caput, quandoque aliorsum, et transferuntur; ita hi spiritus, antequam ad designatum et 
statui eorum communi conformem situm veniunt; sunt eorum status qui ita mutantur et errant. </p>
