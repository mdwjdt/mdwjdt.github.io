<h3 align="center" class="ired">属天的奥秘 第6487节</h3>
<h4 align="center"></h4><p><strong>6487.</strong>当我与天使谈论主的圣治或天命时，有些灵人也在场；他们深信关于命运和绝对必然性的观念，以为主出于这种必然性行事，因为祂只会照着最本质的事物，因而照着属于最完美秩序的事物行进。但这些灵人被指示，人拥有自由；如果他出于自由行事，那么所发生的事就并非出于必然性。这一点可通过将要盖造的房屋来说明；用来打地基、作墙体的砖、水泥、沙子和石头，以及木板和房梁等材料，不是照着建造房屋的次序，而是人随心所欲搜集、堆聚起来的；唯独主知道用这些材料要建造的房屋是什么样子。来自主的所有事物都是最为本质的；但它们不是出于必然性，而是以适合人之自由的方式依次跟随。</p>

When I was talking with the angels about the Divine Providence of the Lord, there were spirits also present, who had impressed on themselves some notion about fate or absolute necessity. They supposed 
the Lord to act from this necessity, because He cannot proceed otherwise than according to the most essential things, thus according to the things that belong to the most perfect order. But they were 
shown that man has freedom, and that if he acts from freedom, it is not from necessity. This was illustrated by the case of houses which are to be built, in that the bricks, mortar, sand, stones serving 
for foundations and columns, also timbers and beams, and the like, are brought together not in that order in which the house is to be constructed, but at pleasure; and that the Lord alone knows what 
kind of a house may be built with these materials. All the things which are from the Lord are most essential; but they do not follow in order from necessity, but in a manner that is applicable to 
the freedom of man. </p>

When I was talking to angels about the Lord's Divine Providence, spirits were also present who had convinced themselves of some idea about fate or absolute necessity. They imagined that such necessity 
determined how the Lord acted since He can proceed only with due regard for things that are utterly essential, that is, only by observing the requirements of utterly perfect order. But those spirits 
were shown that a person possesses freedom, and that if he possesses freedom what happens does not arise out of necessity. A house that is going to be built was used to illustrate the point. The bricks, 
clay, sand, and stones serving as plinths and columns, also planks and beams, and many more such materials, are not gathered together in the order in which the house is constructed but in whatever 
way one pleases, the Lord alone knowing what the house will be like that is built from them. All the things one receives from the Lord are utterly essential; yet they do not follow one another in any 
necessary order but with special reference to the person's freedom. </p>

Cum locutus sum cum angelis de Providentia Divina Domini, aderant etiam spiritus qui aliquid de fato seu necessitate absoluta sibi impresserunt; putabant Dominum ex illa agere, quia non potest aliter 
procedere quam secundum essentialissima, ita secundum illa quae sunt perfectissimi ordinis; sed illis ostensum est quod {1}homini liberum sit, et si ei liberum quod non sit ex necessitate; hoc {2}illustratum 
est per domos quae aedificandae, quod lateres, argillae, arenae, lapides inservientes stylobatis et columnis, tum asseres et tigna, et talia plura comportentur non in eo ordine quo construenda 
domus sed secundum libitum, et quod solus Dominus noverit qualis inde (t)domus exstrui possit; illa omnia quae a Domino, sunt essentialissima, sed non sequuntur in ordine ex necessitate, verum applicate 
ad liberum hominis. @1 A has omne with homini above it$ @2 illustrare datum$ </p>
