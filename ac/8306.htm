<h3 align="center" class="ired">属天的奥秘 第8306节</h3>
<h4 align="center"></h4><p><strong>8306.</strong>“地便吞灭他们”表仅仅由于祂的同在，诅咒和地狱便临到他们。这从“地吞灭”的含义清楚可知，“地吞灭”是指诅咒和地狱；因为这种吞灭表示坠入或投入地狱。此外，地狱位于下面的深处，因为它距离天堂的太阳，也就是主极其遥远，而主在天堂占据最高位置。远离主的距离取决于邪恶和由邪恶所生虚假的质和量。这就是为何天堂看上去在上面，而地狱却在下面。此外，那些陷入邪恶所生的虚假，因而陷入诅咒状态之人所在的地方看似一片荒野之地，被称为“诅咒之地”；那些被投入地狱的人就被扔在这地下面（<a href="7418.htm">7418</a>节）；这一切的发生仅仅因为主的同在（参看<a href="8265.htm">8265</a>节）。这解释了为何“地便吞灭他们”表示诅咒和地狱，这一点清楚可见于摩西五经：<br />摩西对可拉、大坍、亚比兰的会众说，倘若耶和华创作一件新事，使地开口，把他们和一切属他们的都吞下去，叫他们活活地坠落阴间，你们就明白这些人藐视了耶和华。他们下面的地就裂开，这地开了口，把他们吞下去，他们和一切属他们的都活活地坠落阴间。（民数记<a href="http://39-27.cn/民16.30.htm">16:30</a>-<a href="http://39-27.cn/民16.33.htm">33</a>）</p>

The earth swallowed them. That this signifies that by virtue of mere presence they had damnation and hell, is evident from the signification of "to be swallowed by the earth," as being damnation and 
hell; for by this swallowing is signified a falling down, or casting down, into hell; moreover hell is deep down below, because it is very far from the sun of heaven, which is the Lord, and there is what 
is Most High. Removals from thence are according to the qualities and quantities of evils and the derivative falsities. Hence it is that heaven appears above, and hell beneath. Moreover the place 
where they are who are in falsities from evil, consequently in damnation, appears like a desert land, which is called "the damned land," under which are cast down those who are cast into hell (n. 7418). 
That this takes place by virtue of the mere presence of the Lord, see n. 8265. From this then it is that by "the earth swallowed them," is signified damnation and hell, as is clear in Moses: </p>
<p>     
Moses said unto the assembly of Korah, Dathan, and Abiram, If Jehovah create a creation, and the earth open its mouth, and swallow them, and all that appertains to them, that they go down alive into hell, 
ye shall know that these men have provoked Jehovah. And the earth that was under them was sundered, and the earth opened its mouth, and swallowed them, and they, and all that appertained to them, 
went down alive into hell (Num. 16:30-33). </p>

<p align="center"><b>Elliott(1983-1999) 8306</b></p><p><b>8306.</b>
'The earth swallowed them' means that as a result simply of His presence damnation and hell befell them. This is clear from the meaning of 'being swallowed by the earth' as damnation and hell, for that 
swallowing means falling or being cast down into hell. Hell is also positioned deep down below, being furthest away from the Sun of heaven, that is, the Lord, who occupies the highest position there. 
The distances of positions away from Him are determined by the nature and amount of evils and of falsities arising from them; and this is why heaven is seen above and hell below. The place where those 
ruled by falsities arising from evil and consequently in a state of damnation are is also seen as a wilderness-land, which is called the land of damnation. Below this land are cast those sent down 
to hell, <a href="7418.htm">7418</a>, which happens as a result simply of the Lord's presence, <a href="8265.htm">8265</a>. This now explains why 'the earth swallowed them' means damnation and hell, as is also evident in Moses, </p>
<blockquote>

the assembly regarding Korah, Dathan, and Abiram, If Jehovah does something new,<A name="fntext1"></a><A href="#fn1"><sup>a</sup></a> and the earth opens its mouth and swallows them and everything that is theirs, so that they go down alive into hell, you 
will know that these men have provoked Jehovah. And the earth which was under them was split apart; and the earth opened its mouth and swallowed them. And they went down, and all who were theirs, alive 
into hell. <a href="http://bible.gospelcom.net/cgi-bin/bible?passage=Num%2016:30-33&amp;version=ESV&amp;interface=print&amp;showfn=yes&amp;showxref">Num 16:30-33</a>.

`Absorpsit illos terra': quod significet quod ex sola praesentia illis damnatio et infernum, constat ex significatione `absorberi a terra' quod sit damnatio et infernum, nam per absorptionem illam significatur 
delapsus {1}seu dejectio in infernum; infernum {2}etiam est infra profunde, quia longissime a Sole caeli, qui est Dominus; ibi est Altissimum; remotiones abinde sunt secundum malorum et inde 
falsorum qualitates et quantitates, inde est quod caelum appareat supra et infernum infra; apparet etiam ubi illi qui in falsis (c)a malo, proinde in damnatione, {3} sicut terra deserti, quae vocatur 
terra damnata; sub illam dejiciuntur qui in infernum, n. 7418; quod hoc ex sola praesentia Domini, videatur n. (x)8265; inde nunc est quod per `absorpsit illos terra' significetur damnatio et infernum, 
ut {4} patet apud Moschen, Moscheh dixit ad contionem de Koracho, Dathane, et Abiramo, Si creationem creaverit Jehovah, et aperuerit terra os suum, et absorpserit illos, et omne quod illis, ut descendant 
vivi in internum, cognoscetis quod irritaverint viri hi Jehovam: et disrupta est terra quae sub illis, et aperuit terra os suum, et absorpsit illos, et descenderunt illi, et omnes qui illis, 
vivi in infernum, Num. xvi 30-33. 	@1 aut$ 	@2 enim$ 	@3 i apparet$ 	@4 i quoque$ </p>
