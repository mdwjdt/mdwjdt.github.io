<h3 align="center" class="ired">属天的奥秘 第8733节</h3>
<h4 align="center"></h4><p><h4 align="center">木星的灵人和居民-续</h4><br />8733.在大人里面，木星灵与思维的想象力有关；他们说得少，想得多。当他们说话时，他们的言语是有思考力的，或说它是非语言的，不同于其他灵人的语言之处是，与其说它终止于或包含在听得见的声音中，不如说终止于或包含在内心瞬间流畅的一种柔和的低语中。思维本身以这种方式转化为言语。这是因为他们的性情介于属灵人和属天人之间；因为属灵人说话响亮，会把他们的整个思维都变为他们的这种言语。所以若要知晓他们的思维，就必须从所说的话中把它收集起来。但属天人不是这样；因为在他们意愿里的东西会利用思维的某种事物把自己卷成一种波浪，这种波浪会根据主体的状态影响并激起另一个人的意愿。</p>

CONTINUATION CONCERNING THE SPIRITS AND THE INHABITANTS OF THE EARTH JUPITER. As the spirits of the earth Jupiter bear relation in the Grand Man to the Imaginative of Thought, they speak little and 
think much; and when they speak, their speech is cogitative, and differs from the speech of others in the fact that it does not terminate so much in sound, as in a kind of soft murmur which is inwardly 
rapid. The very thought with them in this way unfolds itself into speech. The reason is that they are of a genius intermediate between the spiritual and the celestial; for the spiritual speak sonorously, 
and bring the whole of their thought into their speech; wherefore in order that their thought may be known, it must be gathered from the words. But not so the celestial; for that which is of their 
will rolls itself by somewhat of thought into what is like a wave, which affects and moves the will of another according to the state of the matter. </p>

SPIRITS AND INHABITANTS OF THE PLANET JUPITER - continued </p>
<p>Since they correlate in the Grand Man with the ability to form mental images spirits belonging to the planet Jupiter engage to only a small 
extent in speaking and to a large extent in thinking. When they do engage in speech it is non-verbal, differing from other spirits' kinds of speech in that it is contained not so much in audible sound 
as in a kind of subdued murmur which is inwardly fluent. Thought itself is converted into speech in this kind of way. The reason why is that by disposition they come between those who are spiritual 
and those who are celestial. For the speech of those who are spiritual is contained in audible sound; and they translate the whole of their thought into such speech. To know their thought therefore one 
must gather it from spoken words. But this is not so with those who are celestial. Instead, what is in their will employs something of thought to roll itself into a kind of wave, which then makes an 
impact on and stirs another's will according to the state of the subject. </p>

Continuatio de Spiritibus et Incolis Telluris Jovis </p>
<p>Spiritus telluris Jovis, quia in Maximo Homine referunt imaginativum cogitationis, parum loquuntur et multum cogitant; et cum loquuntur est loquela 
illorum cogitativa, quae ab aliorum loquelis differt in eo quod non terminetur ita in sonorum sed in molle quasi murmur quod intus volubile est; ipsa cogitatio sic se evolvit apud illos in loquelam; 
causa est quia ex genio inter spirituales et caelestes medio sunt; spirituales enim loquuntur sonore, ac omne cogitationis suae injiciunt loquelae, unde cogitatio illorum, ut sciatur, colligenda est 
ex vocibus; at caelestes non ita, sed quod voluntatis illorum est, {1} volvit se per aliquid cogitationis in simile undae, quod alterius voluntatem secundum {2}rei statum afficit et movet. 	@1 i hoc$ 	@2 
statum rei movet et afficit$ </p>
