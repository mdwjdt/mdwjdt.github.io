<h3 align="center" class="ired">属天的奥秘 第801节</h3>
<h4 align="center"></h4><p><strong>801.</strong>对大洪水前的这些人的描述表明了上古之人所采用的风格的性质，因而表明了预言风格的性质。此处直到本章末尾都在描述这些人。本节描述了他们的信念，接下来的23节描述了他们的欲望，也就是说先描述了其觉知之物的状态，之后描述了其意愿之物的状态。尽管他们里面没有正确的觉知和意愿之物，但他们里面的事物，也就是这些事物的反面，必须仍被称为觉知和意愿之物。虚假的信念绝非觉知之物，但必须这样称呼，因为它们是思维和推理之物。这同样适用于绝非意愿之物的欲望。就象我说的，首先描述的是这些人的虚假信念，之后描述的是他们的欲望。这就是为何接下来的23节重复的原因，只是21节所提及之物的顺序有所不同。<br />这也是预言的风格，原因在于，人有两种生命（觉知和意愿），第一种属于觉知之物，第二种属于意愿之物，它们截然不同，彼此分离。人是由这二者构成的，尽管如今它们在人内的是分离的，但它们仍是一个流入另一个，并且绝大部分结合起来。可以用很多方式来证实和说明它们结合起来，以及如何结合的事实。因此，由于人是这两部分构成的，即觉知和意愿，并且一个流入另一个，故当描述人时，圣言就分别描述每个部分，这是重复的原因，否则这种描述是有问题的。一切其它事物，如同这里的意愿和觉知，也是如此。正是它们的主体使得事物恰如它们所是的样子。它们是其主体的产物，因此是这些主体的属性。从其主体，即从其实体分离之物什么都不是。这就是为何圣言描述某个事物时，会描述这两个方面的原因。只有这样，对每个事物的描述才能全面。</p>

<p><strong>[NCE]801.</strong> The portrayal of these pre-Flood people reveals what the literary mode of the earliest people was like and so what the prophetic mode was like. The chapter from here to the end describes those people, telling of their delusions in the current verse and of their appetites in verse <a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_801/bible_king-james-version_genesis_7_23" target=_top>23</a> below. In other words, it depicts the condition of the ideas in their intellect and then the condition of the impulses in their will.<br />Although nothing in them was [truly] a matter of understanding or will, the contrary thoughts and impulses they had must still be called such. These include their distorted convictions, which are anything but matters of understanding, since they are the product of thought and of twisted logic; and their cravings, which are anything but a matter of will.<br />Those people are described, as I was saying, in respect first to their distorted convictions and next to their cravings, which is why the statements of verse <a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_801/bible_king-james-version_genesis_7_21" target=_top>21</a> here are repeated in verse <a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_801/bible_king-james-version_genesis_7_23" target=_top>23</a> below, although in a different order.<br />[2] The prophets used the same manner of expression. Its basis is the existence of two vital forces in us, one belonging to the ideas of the intellect, and the other to the intentions of the will. The two kinds of life force are perfectly distinct from each other. We consist of both, and although they are separate in people today, the one still has an influence on the other and for the most part unites with it. The fact that they unite can be established and illustrated by much supporting evidence, as can the way they unite.<br />Since we consist of these two sides, then — of intellect and will — and since the one side affects the other, when the Word draws a picture of a human being it depicts each of the two sides separately. This is the reason for the repetition, which would otherwise be a defect.<br />The same is true with every facet of reality, because different abstract phenomena exactly mirror conditions in the people who experience them. They are attributes of those people because they arise out of them. An abstract phenomenon separated from the person subject to it, or from a substance underlying it, has no reality at all. This is the reason the Word describes things as having two parts, in the manner detailed above. Doing so makes the portrayal of every phenomenon complete. </p>

From the description of these antediluvians as here given, it is evident what was the style of writing among the most ancient people, and thus what the prophetic style was. They are described here and 
up to the end of this chapter; in these verses they are described in respect to their persuasions, and in verse 23 in respect to their cupidities; that is, they are first described in respect to the 
state of the things of their understanding, and then in respect to the state of the things of their will. And although with them there were in reality no things of understanding or of will, still the 
things contrary to them are so to be called; that is to say, such things as persuasions of falsity, which are by no means things of understanding, and yet are things of thought and reason; and also such 
things as cupidities, which are by no means things of will. The antediluvians are described, I say, first as to their false persuasions, and then as to their cupidities, which is the reason why the 
things contained in verse 21 are repeated in verse 23, but in a different order. Such also is the prophetic style. [2] The reason is that with man there are two lives: one, of the things of the understanding; 
the other, of the things of the will, and these lives are most distinct from each other. Man consists of both, and although at this day they are separated in man, nevertheless they flow one 
into the other, and for the most part unite. That they unite, and how they unite, can be established and made clear by many illustrations. Since man therefore consists of these two parts (the understanding 
and the will, of which the one flows into the other), when man is described in the Word, he is described with distinctiveness as to the one part and as to the other. This is the reason of the repetitions, 
and without them the description would be defective. And the case is the same with every other thing as it is here with the will and the understanding, for things are circumstanced exactly 
as are their subjects, seeing that they belong to their subjects because they come forth from their subjects; a thing separated from its subject, that is, from its substance, is no thing. And this is 
the reason why things are described in the Word in a similar way in respect to each constituent part, for in this way the description of each thing is full. </p>

This description of these people before the Flood shows the nature of the style used by the most ancient people, and consequently of the prophetical style. From here down to the end of this chapter these 
people are described, in the present verses as regards their persuasions, and in verse 23 that follows as regards their desires. That is, they are described as regards the state of the things of their 
understanding, and after that as regards the state of those of their will. Although the proper things of the understanding and of the will did not exist in them, the things in them that were the 
reverse of these must nevertheless be called things of the understanding and will. Though in no sense things of the understanding, persuasions of falsity must be called such because they are matters of 
thought and reasoning; and the same applies to desires which are in no sense things of the will. Those people are described, as I say, first of all as regards their persuasions of falsity, and after 
that as regards their desires. This is the reason why verse 23 which follows repeats, though in a different order, the things referred to in this verse 21. </p>
<p></p>
<p><b>[2]</b>
 Such also is the prophetical style, 
the reason being that there are two kinds of life with man - the first belonging to things of the understanding, the second to those of the will - which are very distinct and separate from each other. 
Man is composed of both, and although they are separated in man nowadays, they still flow one into the other and for the most part unite. The fact that they unite, and how they do so, could be established 
and illustrated in many ways. Since man is therefore composed of these two parts - understanding and will - and one flows into the other, the Word when describing man describes each part separately, 
which is the reason for repetitions; otherwise the description would be defective. As with the will and understanding here, so with everything else. It is their subjects that make things exactly 
what they are. Being the product of their subjects, they are attributes of those subjects. Things separated from their subject, that is, from their substance, are not anything. This is the reason why 
when the Word describes something it does so as regards both areas. In this way the description of everything is made complete. </p>

Ex descriptione antediluvianorum horum, constare potest qualis stilus antiquissimorum fuit, et inde qualis stilus propheticus: describuntur hic usque ad finem hujus capitis, in hoc versu quoad persuasiones, 
in vers. seq. 23 quoad cupiditates; hoc est, quoad statum eorum intellectualium, dein quoad statum illorum voluntariorum; et tametsi nulla apud eos intellectualia nec voluntaria, usque ita nominanda 
sunt quae contraria, sicut persuasiones falsi, quae nihil minus quam intellectus sunt, quia sunt cogitationis et ratiocinationis; pariter cupiditates, quae nihil minus quam voluntatis sunt; describuntur, 
inquam, primum quoad persuasiones falsi, dein quoad cupiditates, quae causa est repetitionum in hoc vers. 21 et in sequente 23, sed alio ordine. [2] Talis quoque est stilus propheticus; causa 
est quia binae vitae apud hominem sunt, una intellectualium, altera voluntariorum, quae distinctissimae inter se sunt; homo ex utraque consistit, et tametsi separatae sunt hodie apud hominem, usque 
tamen influit una in alteram, et se ut plurimum uniunt; quod se uniant, et quomodo se uniunt, a multis constare et illustrari posset: cum itaque homo ex binis his partibus, intellectu et voluntate, 
consistit, et unum influit alteram, cum describitur homo in Verbo, distincte describitur quoad unam partem, et quoad alteram, quae causa est repetitionum; aliter mancum foret. Similiter se habet cum omni 
re, res enim se habent prorsus sicut subjecta, nam sunt subjectorum, quia prodeunt a subjectis; res separatae a subjecto suo, seu a substantia sua, sunt nullae res; quae causa est quod similiter quoad 
utramque partem describantur res in Verbo; ita est descriptio cujuscumque rei plena. </p>
