<h3 align="center" class="ired">属天的奥秘 第5598节</h3>
<h4 align="center"></h4><p><strong>5598.</strong>“和我们的出身”表对那里的信之真理。这从“出身”的含义清楚可知，“出身”是指真理从良善，或信从仁的出生（参看<a href="1145.htm">1145</a>，<a href="1255.htm">1255</a>，<a href="4070.htm">4070</a>，<a href="4668.htm">4668</a>节）。“出身”在内义上之所以具有这种含义，是因为在天堂，除了被称为重生的东西外，天使不会理解为其它出生，重生通过信之真理和仁之良善实现。世人通过这种出生或出身从人的儿子变成主的儿子；这些人就是那些被称为“从神生的”（约翰福音<a href="http://39-27.cn/约1.13.htm">1:13</a>）人。在天堂，弟兄或血缘关系和姻亲关系取决于在这种出生中出于真理的良善和出于良善的真理的多样性。<br />因为天堂有无穷无尽的多样性；但这些多样性是主以这样的方式实现的：它们类似有弟兄姐妹、女婿儿媳、孙子孙女等等的家庭。然而，一般来说，所有人都按照使他们构成一体的那种形式被组织起来。他们就像人体里面的多样性；在人体中，没有哪两个身体部位是一样的；事实上，即便在一个部位里面，也没有哪两个部分是一样的。尽管如此，所有这些不同部分以这样的形式被组织起来：它们行如一体，每一个都或近或远地适应或赞同另一个的活动。这就是人里面的形式，由此可以推断天堂里的形式必是什么样，该形式与人里面的一切事物存在一种对应关系，也就是说，它必是最完美的。</p>

And unto our birth. That this signifies concerning the truths of faith there, is evident from the signification of "birth," as being the birth of truth from good, or of faith from charity (see n. 1145, 
1255, 4070, 4668). That "birth" in the internal sense denotes this is because in heaven no other birth is understood than that which is called regeneration, which is effected by means of the truth 
of faith and the good of charity. By this birth, from being sons of man men become sons of the Lord; these are they who are said to be "born of God" (John 1:13). According to the varieties of good from 
truth and of truth from good in this birth are the brotherhoods or relationships by blood and by marriage in heaven; for in heaven there are perpetual varieties, but the varieties are so disposed by 
the Lord as to represent families in which are brothers, sisters, sons-in-law, daughters-in-law, grandsons, granddaughters, and so on. In general, however, all are disposed in such a form that together 
they make a one, as is the case with the varieties in the human body, where no member is exactly like another, nor indeed any part in one member the same as another part, and yet all the various parts 
are disposed in such a form that they act as a one, and each concurs intimately or remotely with the action of every other. Such being the form in man, it may be inferred what the form in heaven must 
be, with which all the things in man have correspondence-that it must be most perfect. </p>

<p align="center"><b>Elliott(1983-1999) 5598</b></p><p><b>5598.</b>
'And our generation' means regarding the truths of faith there. This is clear from the meaning of 'generation' as the birth of truth from good or faith from charity, dealt with in <a href="1145.htm">1145</a>, <a href="1255.htm">1255</a>, <a href="4070.htm">4070</a>, <a href="4668.htm">4668</a>. 
The reason 'generation' has this meaning in the internal sense is that in heaven no other kind of birth is meant than what is called regeneration, which is effected by means of the truth of faith 
and the good of charity. By this kind of generation or birth the children of men become the children of the Lord; these are they who are called 'the born of God' in <a href="http://bible.gospelcom.net/cgi-bin/bible?passage=John%201:13&amp;version=ESV&amp;interface=print&amp;showfn=yes&amp;showxref">John 1:13</a>. The variations that exist 
in the offspring of good from truth and truth from good within that kind of generation are what determine the brotherly or blood relationships and the relationships by marriage that exist in heaven. </p>
<p></p>
<p><b>[2]</b>
In heaven unending variations exist; but those variations are effected by the Lord in such a way that they resemble families in which there are brothers, sisters, sons-in-law, daughters-in-law, 
grandsons, granddaughters, and so on. In general however all are organized into the kind of form that makes one united whole. They are like the variations within the human body, in which no one member 
is exactly the same as any other; indeed no one part within any member is the same as any other part. Even so, all those varying parts are organized into the kind of form in which they act as a single 
whole, and each fits in directly or remotely with the activity of another. Seeing a form such as this in the human being, one may deduce what the form must be like in heaven, with which there is 
a correspondence - a most perfect one - of everything in the human being. </p>

`Et ad nativitatem nostram': quod significet de veris  fidei ibi, constat ex significatione `nativitatis' quod sit veri a bono, seu fidei a charitate, de qua n. 1145, 1255, 4070, 4668; quod `nativitas' 
in sensu interno sit id, est quia in caelo non alia nativitas intelligitur quam quae vocatur regeneratio, quae fit per verum fidei et bonum charitatis; {1}per hanc nativitatem a filiis hominis fiunt 
filii Domini, hi sunt qui dicuntur `a Deo nati', Joh. i 13; secundum varietates boni a vero et veri a bono in nativitate illa sunt fraternitates seu consanguinitates et affinitates in caelo; [3]{2}nam 
in caelo sunt perpetuae varietates, sed varietates  {3} disponuntur a Domino ut referant {4} familias, in quibus fratres, sorores, generi, nurus, nepotes, neptes, et sic  porro; in genere tamen omnes 
disponuntur in talem formam, ut {5} simul unum faciant; sicut varietates in corpore humano, ubi nullum membrum alteri absolute simile est, immo nec una pars in aliquo membro alteri; usque tamen omnia 
illa varia in talem formam disposita sunt, ut  {6}agant sicut unum, et unumquodvis concurrat ad alterius agendum prope vel remote; cum talis est forma in homine, concludi potest qualis forma erit 
in caelo, cum quo correspondentia est omnium quae in homine, quod nempe perfectissima. @1 etiam derivantur in hac nativitate$ @2 ubivis$ @3 i illae$ @4 i quasi$ @6 i omnes$ @7 unum agant$ </p>
