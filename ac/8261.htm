<h3 align="center" class="ired">属天的奥秘 第8261节</h3>
<h4 align="center"></h4><p><strong>8261.</strong>“那时，摩西和以色列人向耶和华唱这歌”表那些属于属灵教会的人因得释放而将荣耀归与主。这从“唱这歌”的含义，以及“摩西和以色列人”的代表清楚可知：“唱这歌”是指将荣耀归与，如下文所述，即将荣耀归与主，因为在圣言中，“耶和华”是指主（参看<a href="1343.htm">1343</a>，<a href="1736.htm">1736</a>，<a href="2921.htm">2921</a>，<a href="3023.htm">3023</a>，<a href="3035.htm">3035</a>，<a href="5041.htm">5041</a>，<a href="5663.htm">5663</a>，<a href="6280.htm">6280</a>，<a href="6281.htm">6281</a>，<a href="6905.htm">6905</a>，<a href="6945.htm">6945</a>，<a href="6956.htm">6956</a>节）；“摩西和以色列人”是指那些属于属灵教会的人。事实上，摩西与百姓一起代表这个教会，摩西代表它的头，因为他也代表神性真理，百姓或以色列人则代表教会本身。“以色列人”代表那些属于属灵教会的人（参看<a href="6426.htm">6426</a>，<a href="6637.htm">6637</a>，<a href="6862.htm">6862</a>，<a href="7035.htm">7035</a>，<a href="7062.htm">7062</a>，<a href="7198.htm">7198</a>，<a href="7201.htm">7201</a>，<a href="7215.htm">7215</a>，<a href="7223.htm">7223</a>节）。他们因得释放而将荣耀归与主，这一事实从前一章的说明清楚可知。那里说明，那些属于属灵教会的人唯独通过主降世而得救；在此之前，他们滞留在低地，在那里被那些沉浸于邪恶所生虚假的灵人侵扰；等到主在自己里面将人身变成神性之后，他们就被主释放。那些属于属灵教会的人唯独通过主降世而得救（参看<a href="2661.htm">2661</a>，<a href="2716.htm">2716</a>，<a href="2833.htm">2833</a>，<a href="2834.htm">2834</a>，<a href="6372.htm">6372</a>节）；在此之前，他们滞留在低地，等到主在自己里面将人身变成神性时被祂释放（<a href="6854.htm">6854</a>，<a href="6914.htm">6914</a>，<a href="7035.htm">7035</a>，<a href="7091.htm">7091</a>e，<a href="7828.htm">7828</a>，<a href="7932.htm">7932</a>，<a href="8018.htm">8018</a>，<a href="8054.htm">8054</a>节）。<br />“唱首歌”之所以表示将荣耀归与，因而“歌”表示一种荣耀的归与，是因为在古教会和后来的犹太教会，歌是预言。其主题是主，尤其是祂将要降世，摧毁魔鬼团伙，那时比以往任何时候都猛烈，并将忠信的人从他们的攻击中释放出来。由于歌中的预言在内义上包含这些事，所以这些歌表示将荣耀归与主，也就是出于内心的喜乐赞美主。内心的喜乐主要通过歌唱来表达，因为歌中的喜乐可以说是一种自发的声音爆发。正因如此，耶和华，也就是主，在歌中被称为勇士、战士、万军之神、得胜者、力量、保障、盾牌和拯救；被摧毁的魔鬼团伙则称作被击打、吞没、倾覆、扔进地狱的仇敌。<br />甚至在过去的时代，那些对内在意义没有任何概念的人也以为在外在意义上的歌论及世俗事物，如仇敌、战斗、胜利、失败、淹没，这些东西才是真正的含义。但知道一切预言皆涉及天上和神性事物，并且这些就体现在世俗事物里面的人也知道，这些话所论述的主题是当主降世时，不信者所受的诅咒和祂对忠信者的拯救。在那些时代，当知道这一点的人深思它，并由此受到感染时，他们就会体验到内在的欢乐；而其他人的欢乐纯粹是外在的。同时，与人同在的天使也将荣耀归与主。所以歌唱的天使和听歌的天使都出于从天堂所流入的神圣和幸福的流注而体验到天上的欢乐；在这种欢乐中，他们觉得自己似乎被提上天堂。教会的诗歌在古人当中就有这种效果。如今，它们也有这种效果；因为属灵天使的情感尤其被关于主、其国度和教会的诗歌所激发。教会的歌之所以具有这种效果，不仅因为内心的欢乐通过它们变得活跃，然后从内在迸发出来，甚至进入身体最外边的纤维，使这些纤维因着一种欢乐，同时因着一种神圣感而颤动；还因为在众天堂，荣耀通过唱诗班，因而通过许多人彼此的和谐一致而被归与主。天使的言语由此也是和谐的；它分成有节奏的节拍。关于唱诗班，可参看前文（<a href="2595.htm">2595</a>，<a href="2596.htm">2596</a>，<a href="3350.htm">3350</a>，<a href="5182.htm">5182</a>，<a href="8115.htm">8115</a>节）；关于天堂的语言，即它分成有节奏的节拍（<a href="1648.htm">1648</a>，<a href="1649.htm">1649</a>，<a href="7191.htm">7191</a>e节）。正因如此，当属教会的古人将荣耀归与主时，他们通过诗歌、诗篇和各种乐器而如此行。因为属教会的古人想起主的降临，以及祂对人类的拯救时，就会体验到超越其它一切喜乐的一种喜乐。<br />就内义而言，先知之歌包含了将荣耀归与主，这一事实从圣言中的歌明显看出来，如以赛亚书：<br />我耶和华凭公义召你，必紧拉着你的手，保守你，使你作百姓的约，作列族的光，开瞎子的眼，领被囚的出牢狱，领坐黑暗的出地牢。你们当向耶和华唱新歌，从地极赞美祂！旷野和其中的城邑当扬声；磐石的居民当歌唱。他们当将荣耀归给耶和华。耶和华必像勇士出去，必像战士激发热情；祂要战胜仇敌。（以赛亚书<a href="http://39-27.cn/赛42.6.htm">42:6</a>，<a href="http://39-27.cn/赛42.7.htm">7</a>，<a href="http://39-27.cn/赛42.10.htm">10</a>-<a href="http://39-27.cn/赛42.13.htm">13</a>）<br />显而易见，这论述了主，论述了祂将要来释放那些陷入属灵囚禁的人。所以经上说，“向耶和华唱新歌”、“磐石的居民当歌唱”。类似例子出现在同一先知书中：<br />我使你作百姓的约，复兴那地，分得荒芜的产业；对那被捆绑的人说，出来吧！对那在黑暗的人说，显露吧！他们在路上必得饮食，他们的牧场必一切小山坡上。诸天哪，应当歌唱！大地啊，应当欢呼！众山哪，应当回响歌声！因为耶和华已经安慰祂的百姓，也要怜恤祂的困苦之民。（以赛亚书<a href="http://39-27.cn/赛49.8.htm">49:8</a>，<a href="http://39-27.cn/赛49.9.htm">9</a>，<a href="http://39-27.cn/赛49.13.htm">13</a>）<br />这也论及主的降临和被囚之人的释放。<br />诗篇：<br />你们要向耶和华唱新歌；称颂祂的名；在列族中述说祂的荣耀。万民的神都是虚空的偶像，惟独耶和华创造诸天。有荣耀和威严在祂面前；有能力与华美在祂的圣所。你们要将荣耀能力归给耶和华，要将耶和华的名所当得的荣耀归给祂。在列族中要说，耶和华掌王权，世界也坚定，不得动摇；耶和华来了，祂来要审判大地。（诗篇96）<br /><br />耶和华使我从荒凉的坑里上来、从淤泥中出来，使我的脚立在磐石上；祂将新歌赐与我口中，就是赞美我们的神；许多人必看见，并要倚靠。（诗篇<a href="http://39-27.cn/诗40.2.htm">40:2</a>，<a href="http://39-27.cn/诗40.3.htm">3</a>）<br />从这些话也明显可知，“歌”表示由于释放而将荣耀归与主；因为歌包含了内心的欢乐和主的提升：内心欢乐是由于主的降临和那时的拯救；提升是由于战胜属灵的仇敌。内心的欢乐和主的提升就是将荣耀归与所表示的。<br />“歌”表示内心的欢乐，这一点明显可见于这些经文：<br />你们应当弹竖琴称谢耶和华，用十弦瑟歌颂祂。应当向祂唱新歌，弹得巧妙，声音洪亮。因为祂聚集海水如垒，收藏深洋在库房。（诗篇<a href="http://39-27.cn/诗33.2.htm">33:2</a>，<a href="http://39-27.cn/诗33.3.htm">3</a>，<a href="http://39-27.cn/诗33.7.htm">7</a>）<br />以赛亚书：<br />击鼓之乐止息，宴乐人的喧闹停止，弹竖琴之乐也止息了。他们必不得饮酒唱歌。（以赛亚书<a href="http://39-27.cn/赛24.8.htm">24:8</a>，<a href="http://39-27.cn/赛24.9.htm">9</a>）<br />阿摩司书：<br />我必使你们的节期变为悲哀，你们一切的诗歌变为哀歌。（阿摩司书<a href="http://39-27.cn/摩8.10.htm">8:10</a>）<br />耶和华，也就是主的提升通过歌实现，这一事实可见于诗篇：<br />耶和华的仆人大卫向耶和华念这歌的话：耶和华我的力量啊，耶和华是我的岩石，我的堡垒，我的救主；我的神，我的磐石，我所投靠的。是我的盾牌，是拯救我的角，是我的避难所；我要求告当赞美的耶和华，这样我必从我的仇敌中被救出来。（诗篇<a href="http://39-27.cn/诗18.1.htm">18:1</a>-<a href="http://39-27.cn/诗18.3.htm">3</a>）<br /><br />耶和华是我的力量，是我的盾牌；所以我必用诗歌颂赞祂！耶和华是他们的力量，又是祂受膏者得救的力量。（诗篇<a href="http://39-27.cn/诗28.7.htm">28:7</a>，<a href="http://39-27.cn/诗28.8.htm">8</a>）<br /><br />神啊，愿你的救恩将我安置在高处；我要以诗歌赞美神的名，以称谢尊祂为大！（诗篇<a href="http://39-27.cn/诗69.29.htm">69:29</a>，<a href="http://39-27.cn/诗69.30.htm">30</a>）<br />歌的主题是主，这一事实也清楚可见于启示录：<br />二十四位长老唱新歌，说，你配拿书卷，配揭开七印。因为你曾被杀，用自己的血把我们赎回来，归于神。（启示录<a href="http://39-27.cn/启5.8.htm">5:8</a>，<a href="http://39-27.cn/启5.9.htm">9</a>）<br /><br />我看见七位天使唱神仆人摩西和羔羊的歌，说，主神，全能者阿，你的作为大哉，奇哉。圣徒之王阿，你的道途义哉，诚哉。主阿，谁敢不敬畏你，不荣耀你的名呢？（启示录<a href="http://39-27.cn/启15.1.htm">15:1</a>-<a href="http://39-27.cn/启15.4.htm">4</a>）<br />“摩西和羔羊的歌”是指本章中的歌，它被称为“羔羊的歌”，因为歌中的主题是将荣耀归与主。</p>

Then sang Moses and the sons of Israel this song to Jehovah. That this signifies the glorification of the Lord by those who are of the spiritual church on account of liberation, is evident from the signification 
of "singing a song," as being a glorification (of which below); that it denotes the glorification of the Lord is because by "Jehovah" in the Word is meant the Lord (see n. 1343, 1736, 2921, 
3023, 3035, 5041, 5663, 6280, 6281, 6905, 6945, 6956); and from the representation of Moses and the sons of Israel, as being those who are of the spiritual church; for Moses together with the people 
represent that church, Moses its head, because he also represents the Divine truth, and the people or the sons of Israel the church itself. (That "the sons of Israel" denote those who are of the spiritual 
church, see n. 6426, 6637, 6862, 7035, 7062, 7198, 7201, 7215, 7223.) That this glorification of the Lord is on account of liberation, is evident from what was shown in the preceding chapter; namely, 
that they who were of the spiritual church were saved solely by the coming of the Lord into the world, and that until then they had been detained in the lower earth, and there had been infested 
by spirits who were in falsities from evil, and were liberated by the Lord after He made the Human in Himself Divine. (That they who were of the spiritual church were saved solely by the coming of the 
Lord into the world, see n. 2661, 2716, 2833, 2834, 6372; and that until then they had been detained in the lower earth, and were liberated by the Lord when He made the Human in Himself Divine, n. 6854, 
6914, 7035, 7091, 7828, 7932, 8018, 8054.) [2] That "to sing a song" denotes to glorify, and that thus a "song" denotes a glorification, is because in the Ancient Church and afterward in the Jewish 
Church the songs were prophetic and treated of the Lord, especially that He would come into the world, and would overthrow the diabolical crew, then raging more than ever, and would liberate the faithful 
from their assaults. And because the prophetic utterances of the songs contained such things in the internal sense, therefore by these is signified a glorification of the Lord, that is, a celebration 
of Him from gladness of heart; for gladness of heart is especially expressed by a song, because in a song gladness breaks forth as it were of itself into sound. Hence it is that Jehovah-that is, 
the Lord-is called in songs "Hero," a "Man of war," the "God of armies," "Conqueror," "Strength," "Bulwark," "Shield," "Salvation;" and the diabolical crew that is overthrown, "the enemy" that is "smitten," 
"swallowed up," "overwhelmed," "cast into hell." [3] They who knew nothing of the internal sense also believed in time past that such things as were in the world were meant, as worldly enemies, 
battles, victories, defeats, submersions, of which the songs treated in the external sense; but they who knew that all prophetic utterances involved things heavenly and Divine, and that these were 
represented in them, knew that the subject there treated of is the damnation of the unfaithful, and the salvation of the faithful by the Lord, when He would come into the world. And then those who knew 
this, and meditated upon it, and were affected thereby, had internal gladness; but others only external. The angels also who were with the men were at the same time in the glorification of the Lord; 
consequently they who sang, and they who heard the songs, had heavenly gladness from the holy and blessed influx which flowed in from heaven, in which they seemed to themselves to be as it were taken 
up into heaven. Such an effect had the songs of the church among the ancients. Such an effect also they would have at this day; for the spiritual angels are especially affected by songs which are about 
the Lord, His kingdom, and the church. That the songs of the church had this effect, was not only because by them gladness of heart became active, and burst forth from within even to the utmost fibers 
of the body, and set these in motion with a glad and at the same time a holy tremor; but also because there is a glorification of the Lord in the heavens by means of choirs, and thus by the harmonious 
music of many. From this also angelic speech is harmonious, falling into rhythmic measures. (Concerning choirs see n. 2595, 2596, 3350, 5182, 8115; and concerning angelic speech, that it falls 
into rhythmic measures, n. 1648, 1649, 7191e.) From this it is that the glorifications of the Lord among the ancients who were of the church were performed by means of songs, psalms, and musical instruments 
of various kinds; for the ancients who were of the church had a joy that surpassed all other joys from calling to mind the Lord's coming, and the salvation of the human race through Him.  [4] 
That in the internal sense the prophetic songs contained a glorification of the Lord, is evident from the songs in the Word, as in Isaiah: </p>
<p>     I Jehovah have called thee in righteousness, and I will 
take hold of thy hand, I will guard thee, and give thee for a covenant to the people, for a light to the nations, to open the blind eyes, to bring out the bound one from the prison, him that sitteth 
in darkness out of the house of confinement: sing ye to Jehovah a new song, His praise, extremity of the earth; let the wilderness and the cities thereof lift up a voice, let the inhabitants of the rock 
sing, let them give glory to Jehovah; Jehovah shall go forth as a hero, as a man of wars; He shall stir up the zeal, He shall prevail over His enemies (Isa. 42:6, 7, 10-13); </p>
<p> it is evident that this 
treats of the Lord, in that He would come to liberate those who were in spiritual captivity; wherefore it is said, "sing to Jehovah a new song," and "let the inhabitants of the rock sing." In like 
manner in the same: </p>
<p>     I have given thee for a covenant of the people, to restore the land, to divide the wasted heritages; to say to them that are bound, Go forth; to them that are in darkness, Be 
ye revealed: they shall feed upon the ways, and on all hillsides shall be their pasture. Sing, O ye heavens; and exult, O earth; and resound, ye mountains, with song, because Jehovah hath comforted His 
people, and will have mercy on his afflicted ones (Isa. 49:8, 9, 13); </p>
<p> here also the coming of the Lord and the liberation of the bound are treated of.  [5] In David: </p>
<p>     Sing ye to Jehovah a new 
song, bless His name, recount His glory among the nations: all the gods of the peoples are vanities; but Jehovah made the heavens, glory and honor are before Him; strength and comeliness are in His 
sanctuary; give ye to Jehovah glory and strength, give ye to Jehovah the glory of His name; say ye among the nations, Jehovah reigneth, the world also is established, and it shall not be removed; Jehovah 
cometh, He cometh to judge the earth (Ps. 96).      Jehovah hath made me come up out of the pit of vastation, out of the mire of clay; and hath set my feet upon a rock; and He hath put a new song 
into my mouth, even praise to our God; many shall see, and shall trust (Ps. 40:2, 3). From these words also it is evident that a "song" denotes a glorification of the Lord on account of liberation; 
for the songs involved gladness of heart, and the exaltation of the Lord-gladness of heart, on account of the Lord's coming and salvation then; and exaltation, on account of victory over spiritual enemies. 
Gladness of heart with exaltation of the Lord is what is meant by glorification.  [6] That gladness of heart was signified by "songs," is evident in these passages: </p>
<p>     Confess ye to Jehovah 
on the harp, on a psaltery of ten strings, sing psalms to Him, sing ye to Him a new song; beat surpassingly with a loud noise, because He gathereth the waters of the sea together as a heap, He putteth 
the deeps in treasuries (Ps. 33:2, 3, 7).      The joy of timbrels shall cease, the tumult of them that are merry shall cease, the joy of the harp shall cease. They shall not drink wine with a song 
(Isa. 24:8, 9).      I will turn your feasts into mourning, and all your songs into lamentation (Amos 8:10). That the exaltation of Jehovah, that is, of the Lord, was performed by means of songs, is 
plain in David: </p>
<p>     David the servant of Jehovah, who spake unto Jehovah the words of this song: Jehovah, my strength, Jehovah is my rock, and my fortress, and my rescuer; my God, my rock in whom 
I trust; my shield, and the horn of my salvation, my refuge; I will call upon Jehovah, who is to be praised; then shall I be saved from mine enemies (Ps. 18:1-3).      Jehovah is my strength and my shield; 
whence in a song I will confess Him; Jehovah is their strength, and the strength of salvations of His anointed (Ps. 28:7, 8).      Thy salvation O God will bring me on high; I will praise the 
name of God with a song, and will magnify Him with confession (Ps. 69:29, 30). [7] That the songs treated of the Lord, is evident also in John: </p>
<p>     The twenty-four elders sang a new song, saying, Worthy 
art Thou who takest the book, and openest the seals thereof; because Thou wast slain, and hast redeemed us unto God with Thy blood (Rev. 5:8, 9).      I saw seven angels who sang the song of Moses 
the servant of God, and the song of the Lamb, saying, Great and marvelous are Thy works, O Lord, God the Almighty; just and true are Thy ways, O King of saints; who would not fear Thee, O Lord, and 
glorify Thy name? (Rev. 15:1, 2, 4); </p>
<p>"the song of Moses and of the Lamb" is the song which is in this chapter: it is called "the song of the Lamb," because the glorification of the Lord is treated 
of therein. </p>

'Then Moses and the children of Israel sang this song to Jehovah' means that those belonging to the spiritual Church ascribed glory to the Lord because of their deliverance. This is clear from the meaning 
of 'singing a song' as ascribing glory, dealt with below - ascribing it to the Lord, since 'Jehovah' is used in the Word to mean the Lord, <a href="1343.htm">1343</a>, <a href="1736.htm">1736</a>, <a href="2921.htm">2921</a>, <a href="3023.htm">3023</a>, <a href="3035.htm">3035</a>, <a href="5041.htm">5041</a>, <a href="5663.htm">5663</a>, <a href="6280.htm">6280</a>, <a href="6281.htm">6281</a>, <a href="6905.htm">6905</a>, <a href="6945.htm">6945</a>, <a href="6956.htm">6956</a>; and from the representation of 'Moses and the children of Israel' as those who belong to the spiritual Church. For Moses together with the people represents that Church - Moses its head, 
since he also represents Divine Truth, and the people or the children of Israel the Church itself. For the representation of 'the children of Israel' as those who belong to the spiritual Church, see 
<a href="6426.htm">6426</a>, <a href="6637.htm">6637</a>, <a href="6862.htm">6862</a>, <a href="7035.htm">7035</a>, <a href="7062.htm">7062</a>, <a href="7198.htm">7198</a>, <a href="7201.htm">7201</a>, <a href="7215.htm">7215</a>, <a href="7223.htm">7223</a>. The fact that they ascribed glory to the Lord because of their deliverance is evident from what was shown in the previous chapter. There it was 
shown that those belonging to the spiritual Church were saved solely through the Lord's Coming into the world, and that until then they had been held back on the lower earth, where they were molested 
by spirits steeped in falsities arising from evil and were delivered by the Lord after He had made Divine the Human within Himself. For the salvation of those belonging to the spiritual Church solely 
through the Lord's Coming into the world, see <a href="2661.htm">2661</a>, <a href="2716.htm">2716</a>, <a href="2833.htm">2833</a>, <a href="2834.htm">2834</a>, <a href="6372.htm">6372</a>; and for their being held back until then on the lower earth, and their deliverance by the Lord once He had made Divine the

 The reason why 'singing a song' means ascribing glory, so that 'a song' means an ascription of glory, is that in the Ancient 
Church, and subsequently in the Jewish Church, songs were prophetic. Their theme was the Lord, in particular His coming into the world, His destruction of the devil's crew, which was prowling around 
then more than at any other time, and His deliverance of faithful believers from attacks by them. And because the prophetic words of the songs contained such exploits in the internal sense, an ascription 
of glory to the Lord was therefore meant by them, that is, praise of Him from gladness of heart was meant. For gladness of heart is expressed primarily through singing, the gladness in singing 
being so to speak a spontaneous eruption into sound. So it is that in songs Jehovah, that is, the Lord, is called Mighty Man, Man of War, God of Hosts, Conqueror, Might, Fortress, Shield, and Salvation; 
and the devil's crew, which was destroyed, is called the enemy, who was struck, swallowed up, drowned, and cast into hell. </p>
<p></p>
<p><b>[3]</b>
 Even in former times those who had no conception of an internal 
sense thought that when in their external sense songs referred to things of a worldly nature - such as enemies, battles, victories, defeats, drownings - those things were the real meaning. But people 
who knew that all prophetic utterances embodied realities of a heavenly and Divine nature, and that these were represented within things of a worldly nature, also knew that those utterances were referring 
to the damnation of the faithless and the salvation of the faithful by the Lord when He came into the world. And in those times when these people who had knowledge of this contemplated it, and were 
consequently affected by it, they experienced an inner gladness, whereas the others' gladness was purely outward. At the same time the angels too who resided with people ascribed glory to the Lord. 
Therefore those who sang and those who listened to songs experienced heavenly gladness as a result of the holy and blissful influence from heaven, gladness in which it seemed to them as though they were 
transported into heaven. Such was the effect the songs of the Church had among the ancients. Such also is the effect they have at the present day, for the affections of spiritual angels are especially 
stirred by songs which refer to the Lord, His kingdom, and His Church. The songs of the Church had that effect because, for one thing, they inspired gladness of heart, which then burst from within 
right out into the outermost fibres of the body, making them quiver with a glad and at the same time holy feeling, and, for another thing, because in the heavens glory is ascribed to the Lord by choirs, 
thus by very many harmonizing with one another. Hence also angelic speech is harmonic; it falls into rhythmic measures. Regarding choirs, see <a href="2595.htm">2595</a>, <a href="2596.htm">2596</a>, <a href="3350.htm">3350</a>, <a href="5182.htm">5182</a>, <a href="8115.htm">8115</a>; regarding angelic speech, 
that it falls into rhythmic measures, <a href="1648.htm">1648</a>, <a href="1649.htm">1649</a>, <a href="7191.htm">7191</a>(end). So it was that when the ancients who belonged to the Church ascribed glory to the Lord they did so through songs, psalms, and various kinds 
of musical instruments. For the ancients who belonged to the Church experienced a joy surpassing all other joys when they called to mind the Lord's Coming and the salvation of the human race by Him. </p>
<p></p>
<p><b>[4]</b>
The fact that prophetic songs contained internally an ascription of glory to the Lord is clear from songs in the Word, as in Isaiah, </p>
<blockquote>
I Jehovah have called You in righteousness, and I will 
hold Your hand; I will guard You, and give You to be a covenant of the people,<A name="fntext1"></a><A href="#fn1"><sup>a</sup></a> a light of the nations, to open the blind eyes, to bring the bound out of the prison, out of the dungeon-house him who 
sits in darkness. Sing to Jehovah a new song, His praise, O end of the earth! Let the wilderness and its cities lift up their voice. Let the inhabitants of the rock sing. Let them give glory to Jehovah. 
Jehovah will go forth as a Mighty Man, as a Man of Wars He will arouse zeal; He will prevail over His enemies. <a href="http://bible.gospelcom.net/cgi-bin/bible?passage=Isa%2042:6-9&amp;version=ESV&amp;interface=print&amp;showfn=yes&amp;showxref">Isa 42:6-9</a>
</blockquote>
ff. </p>
<p>This refers, as is self-evident, to the Lord, to His future coming to 
deliver those in spiritual captivity. Therefore it says, 'Sing to Jehovah a new song' and 'Let the inhabitants of the rock sing'. A similar example occurs in the same prophet, </p>
<p>I have given You as 
a covenant of the people - to restore the land; to share out the devastated inheritances; to say to the bound, Go out; to those who are in darkness, Reveal yourselves. They will feed along the ways, 
and on all slopes will their pastures be. Sing, O heavens! And be exultant, O earth! And resound, O mountains, with song! For Jehovah has comforted His people, and will have mercy on His afflicted. Isa. 
49:8-10, <a href="13.htm">13</a>ff. </p>
<p>This too refers to the Coming of the Lord and the deliverance of the bound. </p>
<p></p>
<p><b>[5]</b>
 In David, </p>
<blockquote>
Sing to Jehovah a new song; bless His name; declare His glory among the nations. All 
the gods of the peoples are idols,<A name="fntext2"></a><A href="#fn2"><sup>b</sup></a> but Jehovah made the heavens. Glory and honour are before Him; strength and beauty are in His sanctuary. Give to Jehovah glory and strength; give to Jehovah the 
glory of His name. Say among the nations, Jehovah reigns; the world also is firmly established, and will not be moved. Jehovah comes He comes to judge the earth. <a href="http://bible.gospelcom.net/cgi-bin/bible?passage=Ps%2096:1-end&amp;version=ESV&amp;interface=print&amp;showfn=yes&amp;showxref">Ps 96:1-end</a>. 
</blockquote>
<p>In the same author, </p>
<blockquote>
Jehovah 
caused me to come up out of the pit of vastation, out of the muddy clay, and He set my feet upon a rock. And He put into my mouth a new song, praise to our God; many will see and be confident. 
<a href="http://bible.gospelcom.net/cgi-bin/bible?passage=Ps%2040:2,%203&amp;version=ESV&amp;interface=print&amp;showfn=yes&amp;showxref">Ps 40:2, 3</a>. 
</blockquote>
<p>From these quotations too it is clear that 'a song' means an ascription of glory to the Lord because of deliverance. For songs included both gladness of heart and exaltation of the 
Lord - gladness of heart because of the Lord's Coming and salvation then, and exaltation because of victory over spiritual enemies. Gladness of heart coupled with exaltation of the Lord is what is meant 
by an ascription of glory. </p>
<p></p>
<p><b>[6]</b>
 The fact that gladness of heart was meant by 'songs' is evident in David, </p>
<blockquote>
Confess Jehovah with the harp, make melody to Him on a ten-stringed lyre. Sing to Him 
a new song, play skillfully with a loud note. For He gathers the waters of the sea together as a heap; He places the depths in storehouses. <a href="http://bible.gospelcom.net/cgi-bin/bible?passage=Ps%2033:2-7&amp;version=ESV&amp;interface=print&amp;showfn=yes&amp;showxref">Ps 33:2-7</a>. 
</blockquote>
<p>In Isaiah, </p>
<blockquote>
The joy of timbrels will cease, 
the noise of merry ones will cease, the joy of the harp will cease. They will not drink wine with singing. <a href="http://bible.gospelcom.net/cgi-bin/bible?passage=Isa%2024:8,%209&amp;version=ESV&amp;interface=print&amp;showfn=yes&amp;showxref">Isa 24:8, 9</a>. 
</blockquote>
<p>And in Amos, </p>
<blockquote>
I will turn your feasts into mourning, and all your songs into 
lamentation. <a href="http://bible.gospelcom.net/cgi-bin/bible?passage=Amos%208:10&amp;version=ESV&amp;interface=print&amp;showfn=yes&amp;showxref">Amos 8:10</a>. 
</blockquote>
<p>The fact that exaltation of Jehovah, that is, the Lord, was effected by means of songs may be seen in David, </p>
<blockquote>
David the servant of Jehovah, who spoke to Jehovah the words 
of this song. [I will love You,] O Jehovah, my strength. Jehovah is my rock (petra), and my fortress, and my deliverer; my God, my rock (rupee) in which I trust, my shield, and the horn of my salvation, 
my refuge. On Him who is to be praised, on Jehovah I will call; then I shall be saved from my enemies. <a href="http://bible.gospelcom.net/cgi-bin/bible?passage=Ps%2018:1-3&amp;version=ESV&amp;interface=print&amp;showfn=yes&amp;showxref">Ps 18:1-3</a>. 
</blockquote>
<p>In the same author, </p>
<blockquote>
Jehovah is my strength and my shield; therefore with 
song I will confess Him. Jehovah is their strength, and the saving strength of His anointed. <a href="http://bible.gospelcom.net/cgi-bin/bible?passage=Ps%2028:7,%208&amp;version=ESV&amp;interface=print&amp;showfn=yes&amp;showxref">Ps 28:7, 8</a>. 
</blockquote>
<p>In the same author, </p>
<blockquote>
Your salvation, O God, will bring me on high. I will praise the name 
of God with a song and will magnify Him with confession. <a href="http://bible.gospelcom.net/cgi-bin/bible?passage=Ps%2069:29,%2030&amp;version=ESV&amp;interface=print&amp;showfn=yes&amp;showxref">Ps 69:29, 30</a>. 
</blockquote>
<p></p>
<p><b>[7]</b>
 The fact that the Lord was the theme in their songs is also clear in John, </p>
<blockquote>
The twenty-four elders sang a new song, saying, 
You are worthy to take the book, and to open its seals; for You were slain, and have redeemed us to God by Your blood. <a href="http://bible.gospelcom.net/cgi-bin/bible?passage=Rev%205:9,%2010&amp;version=ESV&amp;interface=print&amp;showfn=yes&amp;showxref">Rev 5:9, 10</a>. 
</blockquote>
<p>Also in the same author, </p>
<blockquote>
I saw seven angels, and those 
who were singing the song of Moses, the servant of God, and the song of the Lamb, saying, Great and marvellous are Your works, O Lord God Almighty! Just and true are Your ways, O King of saints! Who 
would not fear You, O Lord, and glorify Your name? <a href="http://bible.gospelcom.net/cgi-bin/bible?passage=Rev%2015:1-4&amp;version=ESV&amp;interface=print&amp;showfn=yes&amp;showxref">Rev 15:1-4</a>. 
</blockquote>
<p>'The song of Moses and of the Lamb' is a song which in this chapter is called 'the song of the Lamb' because an ascription of glory to 
the Lord is the theme in it.

`Tunc cecinit Moscheh et filii Israelis canticum hoc Jehovae': quod significet glorificationem Domini ab illis qui ab Ecclesia spirituali propter liberationem, constat ex significatione `canere canticum' 
quod sit glorificatio, de qua sequitur; quod sit glorificatio Domini, est quia per `Jehovam' in Verbo intelligitur Dominus, n. 1343, 1736, 2921, (x)3023, 3035, 5041, 5663, 6280, {1} 6281, 6905, 
6945, 6956; et ex repraesentatione `Moschis et filiorum Israelis' quod sint qui ab Ecclesia spirituali; Moscheh enim una cum populo Ecclesiam illam repraesentat, `Moscheh' caput ejus, quia etiam Divinum 
Verum, et `populus' seu `filii Israelis' ipsam Ecclesiam; quod `filii Israelis' sint qui ab Ecclesia spirituali, videatur n. 6426, 6637, 6862, 7035, 7062, 7198, 7201, 7215, 7223; quod glorificatio 
Domini sit propter liberationem, patet ab illis quae {2}in capite praecedenti ostensa sunt, quod nempe illi qui ab Ecclesia spirituali unice salvati {3}sint per Adventum Domini in mundum, et quod eo usque 
detenti fuerint in terra inferiore, et ibi infestati a spiritibus qui in {4}falsis ex malo, et liberati a Domino {5}postquam Humanum in Se Divinum fecit; quod illi qui ab Ecclesia spirituali unice 
salvati sint per Adventum Domini in mundum, videatur n. 2661, 2716, 2833, 2834, 6372; et quod eo usque fuerint detenti in terra inferiore, ac liberati a Domino cum Humanum in Se Divinum fecit, n. 6854, 
6914, 7035, 7091 fin., 7828, 7932, 8018, 8054. 	2 Quod `canere canticum' sit glorificare ac ita `canticum' glorificatio, est quia cantica in Ecclesia Antiqua (c)et postea in Judaica erant prophetica, 
et {6}agebant de Domino, imprimis quod venturus in mundum, ac diabolicam turbam, tunc plus quam usquam grassantem, destructurus, (c)et fideles ab impugnationibus illorum liberaturus; {7} et quia 
(t)canticorum prophetica {8}in sensu interno talia continebant, inde per illa significatur glorificatio Domini, hoc est, celebratio Ipsius ex laetitia cordis; laetitia cordis enim per cantum imprimis 
exprimitur, nam {9}laetitia in cantu quasi ex se in sonorum erumpit; inde {10}est quod Jehovah, hoc est, Dominus, {11}in canticis (x)appelletur Heros, Vir belli, Deus exercituum, Victor, robur, propugnaculum, 
scutum, (x)salus; et diabolica turba quae destructa, hostis; qui percussus, (t)absorptus, submersus, conjectus in infernum. 	3 Qui de sensu interno nihil noverunt credebant etiam olim quod intelligerentur 
talia quae in mundo erant, sicut hostes ibi, pugnae, victoriae, clades, submersiones, de quibus cantica {12}in sensu externo agebant; sed qui sciebant quod omnia prophetica involverent 
{13}caelestia et Divina, et quod haec repraesentarentur in illis, sciebant quod {14}ageretur ibi de damnatione infidelium et de salvatione fidelium a Domino cum venturus in mundum; et tunc hi qui id sciebant, 
et id cogitabant, ac inde afficiebantur, internam laetitiam habebant, illi autem modo externam; angeli etiam qui apud homines, simul tunc in glorificatione Domini fuerunt {15}; inde illis qui 
canebant et qui audiebant cantica, ex sancto {16}et beato quae ex caelo influebant, laetitia caelestis {17}in qua sibi visi quasi sublati in caelum; talem effectum habebant cantica Ecclesiae apud antiquos, 
talem quoque effectum {18}habent hodie, nam angeli spirituales imprimis afficiuntur canticis quae de Domino, Ipsius regno, et de Ecclesia; (s)quod cantica Ecclesiae illum effectum {19}habuerint, 
erat non solum ex eo quod laetitia cordis per illa {20}facta sit activa, et ab interiore usque ad extremas corporis fibras {21}eruperit, et has tremore laeto et simul sancto {22}commoverint, sed etiam 
quia glorificatio Domini in caelis fit per choros, ac ita per concentus plurium; inde quoque loquela angelica est harmonica, cadens in numeros; de choris, videatur n. 2595, 2596, 3350, 5182, 8115; 
de loquela angelica, quod cadat in numeros, n. 1648, 1649, 7191 fin.; inde est quod {23}glorificationes Domini apud antiquos qui ab Ecclesia {24}fierent per cantica, psalmos, instrumenta musica varii 
generis; nam gaudium {25}quod excessit omnia gaudia, habebant antiqui qui ab Ecclesia, ex recordatione Adventus Domini et salvationis generis humani per Ipsum.(s) 	4 Quod cantica prophetica glorificationem 
Domini in sensu interno continerent {26}, constat ex canticis in Verbo, ut apud Esaiam, Ego Jehovah vocavi Te in justitia, et apprehendam manum Tuam, {27}Ego custodiam Te, et dabo Te in foedus 
populo, in lucem gentium, ad aperiendum oculos caecos, ad educendum e carcere vinctum, e domo claustri sedentem tenebris.  Cantate Jehovae canticum novum, laudem Ipsius extremitas terrae; {28}extollant 
vocem desertum et urbes ejus; cantent habitatores petrae, ponant Jehovae gloriam; Jehovah sicut heros exibit, sicut vir bellorum, excitabit zelum, super hostes suos invalescet, xiii 6-9, seq.; </p>
<p>quod 
hic agatur de Domino quod venturus ad liberandum illos qui in captivitate spirituali, patet; quare dicitur, `Cantate Jehovae canticum novum, et cantent habitatores petrae': similiter apud (x)eundem, Dedi 
Te in foedus populi, ad restituendum terram, ad dividendum hereditates devastatas, ad dicendum vinctis, Exite, illis qui in tenebris, Revelamini: super viis pascent, et in omnibus clivis pascuum 
illorum.  Cantate, caeli, et exulta, terra, et personate, montes, cantu, quia consolatus Jehovah populum Suum, et afflictorum Suorum miserabitur, xlix 8-10, 13 seq.; </p>
<p>ibi etiam agitur de Adventu Domini 
et de liberatione vinctorum: apud Davidem, 5 Cantate Jehovae canticum novum, {29} benedicite nomini Ipsius, enumerate in gentibus gloriam Ipsius {30}: omnes dii populorum vanitates; at Jehovah caelos 
fecit, gloria et honor coram Ipso, robur et decor in sanctuario Ipsius; date Jehovae gloriam et robur, date Jehovae gloriam nominis Ipsius; dicite inter gentes, Jehovah regnat, etiam orbis stabilitur, 
et non dimovetur; Jehovah venit, venit ad judicandum terram, Ps. xcvi 1 ad fin.: </p>
<p>apud eundem, Jehovah fecit ascendere me e fovea vastationis, e caeno luti; ac constituit super petra pedes meos; 
et dedit in os meum canticum novum, laudem Deo nostro; videbunt multi et confident, Ps. xl 3, 4 [A.V. 2, 3]; </p>
<p>ex his quoque {31}constat quod `canticum' sit glorificatio Domini ob liberationem; cantica 
enim involvebant laetitiam cordis et exaltationem Domini; laetitiam cordis ob Adventum Domini et salvationem tunc, et exaltationem ob victoriam super hostes spirituales; laetitia cordis cum exaltatione 
Domini est quae intelligitur per glorificationem. 	6 Quod laetitia cordis per `cantica' significaretur, patet apud Davidem, Confitemini Jehovae in cithara, in nablio decachordii, psallite Illi, 
cantate Ipsi canticum novum, reddite egregium pulsare cum clangore, quia colligit sicut cumulum (x)aquas maris, dat in thesauris abyssos, Ps. xxxiii 2-7: </p>
<p>apud Esaiam, Cessabit gaudium tympanorum, cessabit 
tumultus hilarium, cessabit gaudium citharae, cum cantu non bibent vinum, xxiv 8, 9: </p>
<p>et apud Amos, Convertam festa vestra in luctum, et omnia cantica vestra in lamentum, viii 10. 	Quod exaltatio 
Jehovae, hoc est, Domini, {32}fieret per cantica, apud Davidem, Servus Jehovae David qui locutus est Jehovae verba cantici hujus: Jehovah robur meum; Jehovah petra mea, et propugnaculum meum, et 
ereptor meus; Deus meus, rupes mea in qua confido, scutum meum, et cornu salutis meae, refugium meum; laudatum invocabo Jehovam, tunc ab hostibus meis servabor, Ps. xviii 1-4 seq.: </p>
<p>apud eundem, Jehovah 
robur meum et scutum meum, unde cantico confitebor Ipsum; Jehovah robur illis, et robur (x)salutum uncti Ipsius, Ps. xxviii 7, 8: </p>
<p>apud eundem, Salus Tua, Deus, in altum deducet me; laudabo nomen 
Dei cantico, et magnum faciam Ipsum confessione, Ps. (x)lxix 30, 31 [A.V. 29, 30]{33}. 	7 Quod de Domino agerent cantica, etiam constat apud Johannem, Viginti quattuor seniores cecinerunt canticum 
novum, dicentes, Dignus es Qui accipias librum, et aperias sigilla illius, quia occisus {34}es, et redemisti Deo (x)nos sanguine Tuo, Apoc. v 9, 10: </p>
<p>et apud eundem, Vidi angelos septem, [et] qui canebant 
canticum Moschis servi Dei, et canticum Agni, dicentes, Magna et mirabilia opera Tua, Domine, Deus Omnipotens; justae et verae viae Tuae, Rex sanctorum; quis non timeat Te, Domine, et non glorificet 
nomen Tuum? Apoc. xv [1,] 2, 3 [,4]; </p>
<p>`canticum Moschis et Agni' est canticum quod in hoc capite vocatur `canticum Agni' quia de glorificatione Domini ibi agitur. 	@1 i 6303,$ 	@2 praecedunt,
