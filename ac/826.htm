<h3 align="center" class="ired">属天的奥秘 第826节</h3>
<h4 align="center"></h4><p>826．有一些两性成员来自所谓的基督教界，他们在肉身生活期间认为通奸不仅合法，甚至还挺神圣，因而在做这种事时披着圣洁的外衣支持集体婚姻，正如他们所冠之的不敬称谓一样。我看到他们被送入火坑，但当他们到那里时，却发生了变化。就在他们到达的那一刻，火坑的火热之光由红色变成白色。我发觉他们不适合在那儿，于是这伙为人所不齿的人从这个地方被转走，然后被驱赶到后面一个地方。我得知他们去了另一个世界，在那里被浸没于死水中，然后由此被转到指定给他们的一个火坑中。从这个火坑中能听到难以形容的嘶嘶声，不过，火坑里的嘶嘶声或嗡嗡声比那些因通奸而玷污圣洁之人的还要下流。</p>

<p><strong>[NCE]826.</strong> There were some of each sex from the so-called Christian world who during bodily life considered their adulteries not only allowable but even sacred and for this reason contracted group "marriages" (as they so profanely called them) under the appearance of sanctity.{*1} As I watched, they were sent to Gehenna, but when they arrived there, a change occurred. Gehenna's fiery glimmer, which is red-hot, became white-hot at their approach, and their inability to get along together became perceptible. As a result, that iniquitous troupe of theirs was removed and transferred to an area behind the back — to another world, I heard, where they would sink into the water and then move on to a new Gehenna created for them.<br />An indescribable sort of hiss could be heard in [the first] Gehenna, but the hissing or whispering there was duller than the sound made by these people who polluted what is holy with their adulteries.<br /><br /><strong>Footnotes:</strong><br />{*1} The exact sect or sects Swedenborg has in mind are not ascertainable, but there is no small supply of candidates. The broad extent of conjugal experimentation among Christian groups is documented as early as about 200 by Clement of Alexandria; he writes scathingly of the Carpocratians, who "think that wives ought to be common property" and thus "bring scandal down upon the name of Christ" (Stromata 3:2). He also describes similar Christians, without labeling them, who practiced "sexual intercourse in common" as a "mystical communion" (Stromata 3:4). Another obscure Christian group, the Adamites, which seems to have begun around Clement's era, is said to have tried to emulate the original innocence of Adam and Eve by, among other practices, rejecting the sacrament of marriage. Their views resurfaced among Christian groups from time to time over the centuries. Swedenborg's readers had ample opportunities to become aware of these heretical groups. The Adamites, for instance, were mentioned as a curiosity by both ancient and contemporary writers — for example, perhaps by Clement himself (see the vague reference to the "followers of Prodicus" in Stromata 3:4); certainly by Epiphanius (after 310-403), another early Christian writer, in his Panarion (heresy 52; see Epiphanius 1990, 189); by Augustine (On Heresies 31; see Augustine 1956, 76-77, 150-151); and by the radical French writer of 1694-1778, Voltaire (Voltaire 1924, under "Nakedness"). In his other writings, Swedenborg shows himself to be very familiar with ancient Christian sects in general (see <a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_826/swedenborg_true-christian-religion-chadwick_378#subsection-2-2" target=_top>True Christianity 378:2</a>) and with contemporary variations such as the Quakers and Moravians (see his 1763 work Supplements 83-90).

There were some, of both sexes, from the so-called Christian world, who in their life of the body had believed adulteries to be not only lawful but even holy, and so held collective marriages, as they 
impiously call them, under a show of sanctity. I saw that they were sent into Gehenna; but when they came there a change took place; the fieriness of Gehenna, which is ruddy, at their coming became 
whiter; and it was perceived that they could not agree together. This execrable troop was therefore separated and driven away into a region behind (into another world, it was said), where they would be 
immersed in stagnant pools, and from there would be conveyed into a new Gehenna appointed for them. There was heard in Gehenna a kind of hissing that cannot be described; but the hiss or buzz of Gehenna 
was grosser than that of those who had defiled holiness by their adulteries. </p>

There were certain members of both sexes from the so-called Christian world who during their lifetime had imagined adultery to be not only permissible but also sacred. In so doing they upheld collective 
marriages, as they irreverently termed them, under a pretence of holiness. I saw that they were sent to Gehenna, but when they got there a change took place. The fiery glow of Gehenna, which is decidedly 
red, turned decidedly white on their arrival, and I perceived that they did not fit in there. Consequently that unmentionable bunch was removed from that place and taken down to a quarter at the 
back. I was told that they had gone into another world where they would be immersed in stagnant waters, and from there on into a new Gehenna that had been provided for them. I heard in this Gehenna 
something like a hissing which was indescribable. But the hissing or hum of Gehenna was duller than that of those people who had defiled holiness by acts of adultery. </p>

</p><b>826.</b>
Quidam ex utroque sexu fuerunt, ex orbe ita vocato Christiano, qui putarunt in vita corporis eorum adulteria non solum licita, sed etiam sancta, et sic communia, ut impie vocarunt, conjugia, sub specie 
sanctitatis habuerant: videbam quod ii missi sint in Gehennam, sed cum ibi veniebant, facta est mutatio; igneum Gehennae quod rubentius est, ex eorum adventu factum est candentius; et perceptum, quod 
non concordare possent; quare cohors ista nefanda inde separata est et delata in plagam a tergo; dictum, quod in alium mundum, ubi immergerentur stagnis, et inde in novam Gehennam quae pro iis.  Auditum 
in Gehenna sibilosum quid, quod non describi potest, sed sibilus seu susurrus Gehennae crassior fuit quam horum qui sanctitatem foedarunt adulteriis. </p>
