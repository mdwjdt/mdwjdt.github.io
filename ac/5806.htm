<h3 align="center" class="ired">属天的奥秘 第5806节</h3>
<h4 align="center"></h4><p><strong>5806.</strong>“他母亲只撇下他一人”表这是教会所拥有的唯一真理。这从便雅悯的代表和“母亲”的含义清楚可知：便雅悯，即此处的“只撇下（的）一人”，是指新真理，如刚才所述（<a href="5804.htm">5804</a>节）；“母亲”是指教会（<a href="289.htm">289</a>，<a href="2691.htm">2691</a>，<a href="2717.htm">2717</a>，<a href="5581.htm">5581</a>节）。关于便雅悯在此所代表、前面（参看<a href="5804.htm">5804</a>节）所描述的真理是教会所拥有的唯一真理这一事实，情况乃是这样：这真理是源于属灵良善（即“以色列”）的真理，由与父亲同在时的便雅悯来代表；而更内在的真理则由与约瑟同在时的便雅悯来代表。与父亲同在时的便雅悯所代表，并被称为新真理的真理就是那使一个人成为一个教会的唯一真理；因为这新真理或前面（<a href="5804.htm">5804</a>节）所论及的这些真理含有从良善所接受的生命在里面。也就是说，处于植根于良善的信之真理的人就是教会；而处于信之真理，却未处于仁之良善的人则不是。对后一种人来说，真理是死的，即便他们可能拥有同样的真理。由此可见这真理是教会所拥有的唯一真理是怎么回事。</p>

And he alone is left of his mother. That this signifies that this is the only truth of the church, is evident from the representation of Benjamin, who here is the "only one left," as being new truth, 
(as just above, n. 5804); and from the signification of "mother," as being the church (n. 289, 2691, 2717, 5581). In regard to this, that the truth which Benjamin here represents, and which is described 
above (see n. 5804) is the only truth of the church, the case is this. This truth is that truth which is from spiritual good (which is "Israel"), and which is represented by Benjamin when with his 
father; but it is a still more interior truth when with Joseph. The truth which Benjamin represents when with his father, and which is called new truth, is that which alone makes man to be the church; 
for in this truth, or in these truths, there is life from good. That is to say, the man who is in truths of faith from good, he is the church; but not the man who is in truths of faith and not in the 
good of charity. For the truths with this man are dead, even though they are the same truths. From this it may be seen what is meant by this being the only truth of the church. </p>

'And he alone is left to his mother' means that this is the only truth the Church possesses. This is clear from the representation of Benjamin, to whom 'the only one left' refers here, as new truth, 
dealt with just above in <a href="5804.htm">5804</a>; and from the meaning of 'mother' as the Church, dealt with in <a href="289.htm">289</a>, <a href="2691.htm">2691</a>, <a href="2717.htm">2717</a>, <a href="5581.htm">5581</a>. With regard to the fact that this truth - represented here by 'Benjamin', and described 
above in <a href="5804.htm">5804</a> - is the only truth the Church possesses, the situation is this: Such truth is truth springing from spiritual good, which is 'Israel'; and it is what 'Benjamin' represents when he is 
with his father, whereas truth even more interior is represented by him when he is with Joseph. The truth which Benjamin represents when he is with his father and which is called new truth is the only 
truth that enables a person to be a Church, for this new truth or those truths [spoken of in <a href="5804.htm">5804</a>] hold life received from good within them. That is, the person with whom the truths of faith exist rooted 
in good is a Church, not so the person with whom the truths of faith but no good of charity exist. With the latter person the truths are dead, even though they may have been the same truths. From 
all this one may see what the situation is with regard to the fact that this truth is the only truth the Church possesses. </p>

`Et relictus ille solus matri suae': quod significet quod id verum solum Ecclesiae, constat ex repraesentatione `Benjaminis' qui hic est `qui solus relictus', quod sit verum novum, de qua mox supra 
n. (x)5804; et (c)a significatione `matris' quod sit Ecclesia, de qua n. 289, 2691, 2717, (x)5581. Cum hoc quod id verum quod hic `Benjamin' repraesentat, et describitur {1} supra n. 5804, sit solum verum 
Ecclesiae, ita se habet: hoc verum est id verum quod ex bono spirituali quod `Israel', et quod repraesentat `Benjamin cum apud patrem', at adhuc interius verum cum apud Josephum; illud verum quod 
Benjamin apud patrem suum repraesentat et vocatur verum novum, {2} est quod solum facit hominem ut sit Ecclesia, nam in hoc vero seu in illis veris est vita a bono, hoc est, homo qui in veris fidei est 
ex bono, is est Ecclesia, non autem homo qui in veris fidei est et non in bono charitatis, vera enim apud hunc mortua sunt, tametsi {3}fuissent eadem vera; inde constare potest quomodo se habet cum 
hoc quod id verum solum Ecclesiae sit. @1 i mox$ @2 i hoc verum$ @3 A d forent, i sunt$ </p>
