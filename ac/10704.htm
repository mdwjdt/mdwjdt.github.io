<h3 align="center" class="ired">属天的奥秘 第10704节</h3>
<h4 align="center"></h4><p><strong>10704</strong>.“他出来，便将所吩咐的告诉以色列人”表向那些兴趣在于没有内在之物的外在事物之人传达他通过内在之物所接受的指示。这从“出来告诉”和“耶和华所吩咐的”的含义，以及“以色列人”的代表清楚可知：“出来告诉”是指传达，因为当摩西出来时，他向以色列人传达了他从耶和华那里所听来的；“以色列人”是指那些兴趣在于没有内在之物的外在事物之人（参看<a href="10692.htm">10692</a>节提到的地方）；“耶和华所吩咐的”是指摩西从主那里所接受的指示。显而易见，被吩咐表示接受指示；在圣言中，“耶和华”是指主（可参看<a href="9373.htm">9373</a>节提到的地方）。</p>

And he went out, and spoke unto the sons of Israel that which was commanded. That this signifies communication with those who are in external things without what is internal concerning those things about 
which he was informed through the internal, is evident from the signification of "going out and speaking," as being communication, for that which Moses heard from Jehovah, he communicated to the 
sons of Israel when he went out; from the representation of the sons of Israel, as being those who are in external things without internal things (see at the places cited in n. 10692); and from the signification 
of "which was commanded by Jehovah," as being the things about which Moses was informed by the Lord. That "to be commanded" denotes to be informed is evident; and that "Jehovah" in the Word 
denotes the Lord may be seen at the places cited in n. 9373. </p>

<p align="center"><b>Elliott(1983-1999) 10704</b></p><p><b>10704.</b>
'And he came out and told the children of Israel what had been commanded' means communicating to those whose interest lies in things on an outward level devoid of what is inward, regarding instructions 
which he had received through what was inward. This is clear from the meaning of 'going out and telling' as communicating, for when Moses came out he communicated to the children of Israel what he 
had heard from Jehovah; from the representation of 'the children of Israel' as those whose interest lay in things on an outward level devoid of what is inward, dealt with in the places referred to in <a href="10692.htm">10692</a>; and from the meaning of 'what had been commanded by Jehovah' as the things regarding which Moses had received instructions from the Lord. It is self-evident that 'being commanded' things means 
receiving instructions; and as regards 'Jehovah' in the Word, that He is the Lord, see in the places referred to in <a href="9373.htm">9373</a>.  </p>

`Et exivit, et locutus ad filios Israelis id quod praeceptum est':  quod significet communicationem cum illis qui in externis absque interno sunt, de illis de quibus per internum informatus, constat 
ex significatione `exire et loqui' quod sit communicatio, nam quae audivit Moscheh a Jehovah cum exivit, cum filiis Israelis communicavit; ex repraesentatione `filiorum Israelis' quod sint qui in externis 
absque internis sunt, de qua in locis citatis n. 10692; et ex significatione `quod praeceptum est a Jehovah' quod sit de quibus Moscheh informatus est a Domino; quod praecipi sit informari, patet, 
et quod Jehovah in Verbo sit Dominus, videatur in locis citatis n. 9373. </p>
