<h3 align="center" class="ired">属天的奥秘 第10146节</h3>
<h4 align="center"></h4><p><strong>10146</strong>.“这要在耶和华面前”表来自主。这从以下事实清楚可知：在圣言中，“耶和华”是指主（参看<a href="9373.htm">9373</a>节提到的地方）。“在耶和华面前”之所以表示来自主，是因为“在面前”表示同在，主随着对来自祂的属爱的良善和属信的真理被接受而同在。因此，“在主面前”表示来自主。诚然，主与每个人同在；然而，祂与善人同在的方式却不同于与恶人同在的方式。就善人而言，祂在他们源于信之真理的思维的一切细节和源于爱之良善的渴望的一切细节中同在，或说祂在他们出于信之真理所思考的一切细节和出于爱之良善所意愿的一切细节中同在。祂以这种方式同在：祂自己构成他们的信，祂自己构成他们的爱。因此，祂可以说住在他们里面，正如主自己在约翰福音中所说的那样：<br />真理的灵将与你们同住，也要在你们里面。你们就知道我在父里面，你们在我里面，我也在你们里面。有了我的诫命又遵守的，那人是爱我的。我们要到他那里去，并要在他那里作我们的住所。（约翰福音<a href="http://39-27.cn/约14.17.htm">14:17</a>，<a href="http://39-27.cn/约14.18.htm">18</a>，<a href="http://39-27.cn/约14.20.htm">20</a>，<a href="http://39-27.cn/约14.21.htm">21</a>，<a href="http://39-27.cn/约14.23.htm">23</a>）<br />但就恶人而言，主不是在一切细节中同在，因为他们没有信或仁。祂以一种泛泛的方式同在，这种同在赋予他们思考和意愿，以及只要停止邪恶就接受信和仁的能力。但只要他们不停止邪恶，祂似乎就缺席。祂似乎缺席的程度取决于信和爱之真理和良善缺乏的程度。正因如此，那些在天堂里的人经历主的同在，而那些在地狱里的人则经历祂的缺席。<br />而真相却是，不是主从人那里缺席，而人从主那里缺席。因为一个被邪恶主宰的人背离祂向后看，这时在他眼前的事物照着它们与主宰他的邪恶的密切程度而与他同在。事实上，来世没有空间，只有与人里面的思维和情感网络一致的空间的表象。这一切极像就光和热而言，这个世界的太阳的同在。太阳每时每季都一样同在，但当地球远离太阳时，光就会消失，而黑暗则会降临；首先到来的是晚上的阴影，然后就是夜间的黑暗。当地球没有与太阳直接连成一条线，而是成一定角度时，如冬天里的情形，热就会退去，而寒冷则到来；结果，地上的一切事物都变得不活跃并消亡。这也被称为太阳的缺席，而事实上，这是地球从太阳那里的缺席，不是空间上的缺席，而是就光和热的状态而言的缺席。提到这些现象是为了帮助说明这个问题。</p>

Before Jehovah. That this signifies from the Lord is evident from the fact that "Jehovah" in the Word denotes the Lord (see the places cited in n. 9373); that "before Jehovah" denotes from the Lord, 
is because "before" signifies presence, and the presence of the Lord exists in proportion to the reception of the good which is of love and of the truth which is of faith from Him; hence it is that "before 
the Lord" denotes from the Lord. The Lord is indeed present with every man, but He is present with the good in one way, and with the evil in another; with the good He is present in every particular 
they think from the truths of faith, and which they will from the good of love; and He is so present that He Himself is faith, and He Himself is love with them; consequently He is as if dwelling in 
them, according to the words of the Lord Himself in John: </p>
<p>     The Spirit of truth shall abide with you, and shall be in you, and ye shall know that I am in My Father, and ye in Me, and I in you. He 
that hath My commandments and doeth them, he it is that loveth Me; and We will come unto him, and make Our abode with him (John 14:17, 18, 20, 21, 23). [2] But with the evil the Lord is not present 
in every particular, because they have no faith or charity; but He is present in general, by which presence they have the faculty of thinking and willing, and also of receiving faith and charity; but 
only insofar as they desist from evils. Insofar as they do not desist from evils He appears absent; and the degrees of His absence are according to the absence of the truth and good of faith and of love. 
Thus they who are in heaven are in the presence of the Lord, but they who are in hell are in His absence.  [3] Nevertheless the fact is that the Lord is not absent from man, but man is absent from 
the Lord, for the man who is in evils looks backward from Him; and then the things which are before his eyes are present with him according to their affinities with the evils in which he is; for in 
the other life there is no space, but only the appearance of space according to the affinities of the thoughts and affections. This closely resembles the presence of the sun of this world in respect 
to its light and heat; the sun is equally present at all times; but when the earth turns itself from the sun, the light perishes, and shade comes on; first the shade of evening, and then the shade of 
night. And when the earth does not look directly to the sun, but obliquely, as in the time of winter, the heat perishes, and cold comes on, in consequence of which all things of the earth become torpid 
and die. This is also called the absence of the sun, when nevertheless it is the absence of the earth from the sun-not as to space, but as to the state of light and heat. This is said for the sake of 
illustration. </p>

'Before Jehovah' means from the Lord. This is clear from the consideration that 'Jehovah' in the Word is the Lord, see the places referred to in <a href="9373.htm">9373</a>. From the Lord is meant by 'before Jehovah' because 
'before' means presence, and the Lord is present to the extent that good which belongs to love and truth which belongs to faith are received from Him. Consequently before the Lord means from the Lord. 
The Lord, it is true, is present with every individual person, yet the way in which He is present with the good is different from the way in which He is present with the evil. In the case of the good 
He is present in every detail of their thought springing from the truths of faith and in every detail of their desires springing from the good of love. He is present in such a way that He Himself 
constitutes their faith and He Himself constitutes their love. Therefore He is so to speak a resident within them, in keeping with the Lord's own words in John,  </p>
<blockquote>
The Spirit of truth will remain with 
you and will be in you. And you will know that I am in My Father, and you in Me, and I in you. He who has My commandments and does them, he it is who loves Me. We will come to him and make Our home 
with him. <a href="http://bible.gospelcom.net/cgi-bin/bible?passage=John%2014:17,18,20,21,23&amp;version=ESV&amp;interface=print&amp;showfn=yes&amp;showxref">John 14:17,18,20,21,23</a>.  
</blockquote>

<p><b>[2]</b>
 But in the case of those who are evil the Lord is not present in every detail, because they have no faith or charity. He is present in a general way, and this 
presence gives them the ability to think and will, and also to receive faith and charity so far as they refrain from evils. But so far as they do not refrain from them He seems to be absent. How far 
absent He seems to be depends on how far the truth and good of faith and love are absent. So it is that those in heaven experience His presence, and those in hell experience His absence.  </p>
<p></p>
<p><b>[3]</b>
 But the 
reality of the situation is not that the Lord is absent from man, rather that man is absent from the Lord. For a person ruled by evils looks backwards, away from Him, and the things then before his 
eyes are present within him according to their affinity with the evils that rule him. For in the next life space does not exist, only the appearance of space that accords with the network of thoughts 
and affections in a person. The situation in all this is just like that of the presence of the worldly sun so far as light and heat are concerned. The sun is equally present during every time and season; 
but when the planet turns away from the sun, the light fades and darkness descends, first the darkness of evening, then the darkness of night. And when the earth is not directly in line with the 
sun but at an angle, as happens in wintertime, the heat departs and cold sets in, as a consequence of which all things in the ground become inactive and die off. This too is called an absence of the sun, 
when in fact it is an absence of the planet from the sun, not spatially but so far as the conditions of light and heat are concerned. These phenomena have been mentioned to help to illustrate the 
 matter.  </p>

`Coram Jehovah': quod significet a Domino, constat ex eo quod `Jehovah' in Verbo sit Dominus, videantur citata n. 9373; quod `coram Jehovah' sit a Domino, est quia `coram' significat praesentiam, et 
praesentia Domini est quantum recipitur bonum quod amoris et verum quod fidei ab Ipso; inde est quod coram Domino sit a Domino; Dominus quidem praesens est apud unumquemvis hominem, sed aliter praesens 
est apud bonos quam apud malos; apud bonos est praesens in singulis quae cogitant ex veris fidei, et quae volunt ex bono amoris; et ita praesens ut Ipse sit fides, et Ipse sit amor illis; proinde est 
apud illos sicut habitans, secundum Ipsius Domini verba apud Johannem,      	Spiritus veritatis apud vos manebit et in vobis erit; et cognoscetis quod Ego in Patre Meo, et vos in Me, et Ego in vobis; 
qui habet praecepta Mea et facit ea, ille est qui amat Me; ad illum veniemus et mansionem apud illum faciemus, iv 17, 18, 20, 21, 23. 	[2] At apud malos Dominus non est praesens in singulis, quia 
illis non fides nec charitas, sed praesens est {1} in communi, per quam praesentiam illis est facultas cogitandi et volendi, et quoque recipiendi fidem et charitatem {2}, (o)sed quantum desistunt a malis; 
quantum vero {3} ab his non desistunt tantum apparet absens; gradus absentiae Ipsius sunt secundum absentiam veri et boni fidei et amoris; inde est quod qui in caelo sunt, in praesentia Domini sint, 
at qui in inferno, in Ipsius absentia. 	[3] Sed usque res ita se habet: Dominus non est absens ab homine, sed homo est absens a Domino, spectat enim homo qui in malis est, retro ab Ipso; et quae 
tunc ei ante oculos sunt, ei praesentia sunt secundum affinitates malorum in quibus est; in altera enim vita non est spatium sed modo apparentia spatii secundum affinitates cogitationum et affectionum; 
se habent illa paene sicut praesentia solis (o)mundi quoad lucem et quoad calorem; sol aeque praesens est omni tempore; sed cum tellus se avertit a sole, tunc perit lux et subit umbra, primum umbra 
vesperae, et dein umbra noctis; et cum tellus non spectat directe ad solem {4} sed oblique, ut fit tempore hiemis, tunc perit calor et subit frigus, ac inde torpescunt et emoriuntur omnia terrae; hoc 
quoque vocatur {5} absentia solis, cum tamen est absentia telluris a sole, non quoad spatium sed quoad statum lucis et caloris; haec dicta sunt illustrationis causa. @1 sed solum$ @2 amorem$ @3 sed 
quantum$ @4 illum$ @5 haec quoque vocantur$ </p>
