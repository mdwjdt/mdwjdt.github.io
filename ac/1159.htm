<h4 align="center"></h4><p><strong>1159.</strong>“各有各的口音、宗族、民族”表这些人照着各自的性情分布；“各有各的口音”表照着各自的信仰；“各有各的宗族”表照着他们的正直；“各有各的民族”表总体上的这二者（信仰和正直）。这从圣言中“口音”、“宗族”和“民族”的含义清楚看出来，关于它们，蒙主怜悯，以后再讨论。“口音”的内义之所以表特定信仰，因而表原则和信念，是因为口音对应于人心智的理解力部分，即对应于他的思维，如同结果对应于它的原因。这不仅是说话时人的思维流入口音动作的情形，还是天堂流注的情形。有关它们的亲身经历，蒙主怜悯，将在别处讲述。<br />“宗族”的内义表正直，也表仁和爱，这一点出于以下事实：属于相爱的一切事物在天堂就象血亲关系和裙带关系，因而象家族（参看<a href="685.htm">685</a>节）。这就是为何属于爱或仁之物在圣言中被描述为“家”，以及“宗族”的原因。在此没有必要证实它们。“家”就有这种含义（参看<a href="710.htm">710</a>节）。<br />“民族” 表总体上的这二者（信仰和正直），这从圣言中“一族”或“列族”的含义清楚可知。从正面意义上说，“民族”表新的意愿和理解力之物，因而表爱之善和信之真。但从反面意义上说，它们表恶和假。“家”、“宗族”和“口音”同样如此，这可从圣言的大量经文得以证实。原因在于，上古教会划分成独立的家庭、宗族和民族。一对夫妇和他们的子女，外加仆婢就组成一个家。大量相近的家庭组成一个宗族，而大量宗族则组成一个民族。因此，民族是指聚成一个整体的所有宗族。天堂也一样，不过，那里的一切关系皆取决于对主的爱与信（参看<a href="685.htm">685</a>节）。<br />因此，“民族”的内义由此而来，即“民族”是包含意愿与理解力之物，或也可说包含爱与信之物的统称。然而，它们的含义取决于组成它们的族和家（对此，参看<a href="470.htm">470</a>，<a href="471.htm">471</a>，<a href="483.htm">483</a>节）。由此清楚可知，“民族”表总体上的这二者（信仰和正直），“各有各的口音、宗族、民族”表这些人照着各自的性情，他们的敬拜源于古教会。</p>

<p><strong>[NCE]1159.</strong> Each by its tongue, by their clans, in their nations, means each according to its mentality. By its tongue is each according to its way of thinking, by their clans is according to its sense of ethics, and in their nations is in respect to both traits more broadly. This can be seen from the symbolism of tongue, clans, and nations in the Word, as explained below, by the Lord's divine mercy.<br />On the inner level, a tongue symbolizes a way of thinking, so it symbolizes assumptions and opinions. The reason for the symbolism is that the correlation between our tongue and our intellectual side — that is, our thoughts — is the same as that between an effect and its cause. And not only does a person's thinking flow into the movements of the speaking tongue in this way but heaven does too. The evidence of experience concerning these things will be given elsewhere, the Lord in his divine mercy willing [<a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_1159/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_1638" target=_top>1638</a>, <a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_1159/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_3741#subsection-2-2" target=_top>3741:2</a>, <a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_1159/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_4044" target=_top>4044</a>, <a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_1159/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_4791" target=_top>4791</a>, <a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_1159/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_4801" target=_top>4801</a>].<br />[2] The inner-level symbolism of clans as a sense of ethics, and also as charity and love, is due to the fact that all the bonds of mutual love in heaven resemble blood relationships and family ties and so resemble clans. (For more on this see <a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_1159/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_685" target=_top>685</a>.) In the Word, then, things that have to do with love or charity are depicted as households and clans, although there is no need to spend time proving it here. (For this symbolism of households, see <a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_1159/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_710" target=_top>710</a>.)<br />[3] The symbolism of the nations as both traits more broadly can be seen from the symbolism of a nation or nations in the Word. In a good sense, they symbolize the contents of the will and the intellect when these faculties have been renewed. As a result they symbolize the good effects of love and the true ideas of faith. In the opposite sense, though, they symbolize evil and falsity, as do households, clans, and tongues. These things can be corroborated by many passages in the Word.{*1} The reason for this symbolism is that the earliest church was divided into households, clans, and nations. A household comprised a married couple together with their children and their male and female servants; a clan comprised a number of households that were not too far apart; while nations comprised several clans. So the nations meant all clans taken together, or collectively. The situation in heaven is similar, but all relationships there are determined by people's love for the Lord and faith in him (see <a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_1159/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_685" target=_top>685</a>).<br />[4] This, then, is why on an inner level the nations symbolize something broader that incorporates attributes of both will and intellect — or aspects of both love and faith, to put it another way — in relation to the clans and households that compose them. (For more on this, see what was said earlier, at <a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_1159/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_470" target=_top>470</a>, <a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_1159/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_471" target=_top>471</a>, <a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_1159/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_483" target=_top>483</a>.)<br />These things show that the nations symbolize both traits more broadly and that each by its tongue, by their clans, and in their nations means the mentality of every person, clan, and nation that inherited its worship from the ancient church.<br /><br /><strong>Footnotes:</strong><br />{*1} For corroboration of what "nations" symbolize, see the passages mentioned in <a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_1159/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_1259" target=_top>1259</a>, <a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_1159/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_1261" target=_top>1261</a>, <a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_1159/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_1416" target=_top>1416</a>, and Swedenborg's <a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_1159/swedenborg_apocalypse-revealed-rogers_282" target=_top>Revelation Unveiled 282</a>.

Everyone according to his tongue, according to their families, as to their nations. That this signifies that these were according to the genius of each; "according to their tongue," according to the 
opinion of each; "according to their families," according to their uprightness; and "as to their nations," as regards both in general, may be seen from the signification of "tongue," of "families," and 
of "nations," in the Word; concerning which of the Lord's Divine mercy hereafter. That "tongue," or "language," in the internal sense, signifies opinion, thus principles and persuasions, is because 
there is a correspondence of the tongue with the intellectual part of man, or with his thought, like that of an effect with its cause. Such also is not only the influx of a man's thoughts into the movements 
of the tongue in speaking, but also the influx of heaven, concerning which some things from experience, by the Divine mercy of the Lord, will be told elsewhere.  [2] That "families" in the internal 
sense signify uprightness, and also charity and love, comes from the fact that in the heavens all things which are of mutual love are circumstanced as are relationships by blood and by marriage, 
thus as families (see n. 685). In the Word therefore the things which pertain to love or charity are expressed by "houses," and also by "families," which it is unnecessary here to stop to confirm. (That 
such is the signification of a "house" may be seen at n. 710.)  [3] That "nations" here signify both, in general, is evident from the signification of a nation, or nations, in the Word. In a good 
sense "nations" signify things of the new will and understanding, consequently the goods of love and truths of faith; but in the opposite sense they signify evils and falsities; and in like manner so 
also do "houses," "families," and "tongues," as may be confirmed by very many passages from the Word. The reason is that the Most Ancient Church was distinguished into houses, families, and nations. 
A married pair with their children, and their menservants and maidservants, constituted a house; a number of houses that were not far distant from one another constituted a family; and a number of families, 
a nation. Hence "nations" signified all the families taken together in the aggregate. It is much the same in heaven; but the relation of all there is according to love and faith toward the Lord 
(see n. 685).  [4] From this then comes the signification of "nations" in the internal sense, as a general term comprising things of both the will and the understanding, or what is the same of both 
love and faith; but relatively to the families and houses of which they are composed. (See also what has been said before concerning this subject, n. 470, 471, 483.) It is evident from these considerations 
that "nations" signify both [opinion and uprightness] in general; and that "everyone according to his tongue, according to their families, as to their nations," signifies according to the genius 
of each man, family, and nation, to whom worship was derived from the Ancient Church.  </p>

<p align="center"><b>Elliott(1983-1999) 1159</b></p><p><b>1159.</b>
'Every one according to his tongue, according to their families, as to their nations' means that they were ranged according to the character of each one, 'according to his tongue' meaning according to 
each one's individual belief, 'according to their families' meaning according to uprightness, 'as to their nations' meaning as to both belief and uprightness in general. This becomes clear from the 
meaning of 'tongue', and 'families', and 'nations' in the Word, which will in the Lord's Divine mercy be discussed later on. The reason why in the internal sense 'tongue' means individual belief, and 
so basic assumptions and persuasions, is that the tongue corresponds to the understanding part of man's mind, that is, to his thought, in the way that an effect corresponds to its cause. Such is the case 
not only with the influx of a person's thoughts into the movements of the tongue in speaking, but also with the influx of heaven, about which something from personal experience will in the Lord's 
Divine mercy be stated elsewhere. </p>
<p></p>
<p><b>[2]</b>
 That 'families' in the internal sense means uprightness, as well as charity and love, arises from the fact that all things belonging to mutual love are in the 
heavens like blood relatives and relatives by marriage, and so are like families, see <a href="685.htm">685</a>. This is why in the Word things belonging to love or charity are described as 'houses' and also as 'families', 
points which there is no need to pause over and confirm here. That 'a house' has this meaning, see <a href="710.htm">710</a>. </p>
<p></p>
<p><b>[3]</b>
 That 'nations' means both belief and uprightness in general is clear from the meaning of 
'a nation' or 'nations' in the Word. In the good sense nations mean things of the new will and understanding, and so mean the goods of love and the truths of faith. But in the contrary sense evils and 
falsities are meant. The same applies to houses, families, and tongues, as may be confirmed from very many places in the Word. The reason is that the Most Ancient Church was distinguished into separate 
houses, families, and nations. A married couple with their children, together with menservants and maidservants, constituted one house. A number of houses in close proximity in turn constituted one 
family, while a number of families constituted a nation. Consequently nations meant all families taken together as a whole. The same applies in heaven, but all relationships there are determined by 
love to and faith in the Lord, <a href="685.htm">685</a>. </p>
<p></p>
<p><b>[4]</b>
 This then is how nations come to mean what they do in the internal sense, namely that which is general embracing things both of the will and of the understanding, 
or what amounts to the same, both the things of love and those of faith. Their meaning however depends on the families and houses of which they consist. For these points, see also what has been 
stated already in <a href="470.htm">470</a>, <a href="471.htm">471</a>, <a href="483.htm">483</a> From these considerations it is clear that 'nations' means both belief and uprightness in general, and that 'everyone according to his tongue, according to their families, 
and as to their nations' means the disposition of each person, family, and nation whose worship was derived from the Ancient Church. </p>

Quod 'quaelibet juxta linguam suam, juxta familias suas, quoad gentes suas' significent quod illa secundum cujusvis genium;  'juxta linguam' quod sit juxta opinionem cujusvis; 'juxta familias suas' 
quod sit juxta probitatem; 'quoad gentes suas' quod sit quoad utrumque in communi:  constare potest a significatione 'linguae,' et 'familiarum,' et 'gentium' in Verbo, de quibus ex Divina Domini Misericordia, 
in sequentibus.  Quod 'lingua' significet in sensu interno opinionem, ita principia et persuasiones, causa est quia talis est linguae correspondentia cum intellectuali parte hominis, seu cum 
ejus cogitatione, qualis est effectus cum sua causa; talis etiam est influxus non solum cogitationum hominis in linguae loquentis motus, sed etiam talis est influxus caeli, de quo aliqua ab experientia, 
ex Divina Domini Misericordia, alibi.  [2] Quod 'familiae' significent in sensu interno probitatem, tum charitatem et amorem, inde venit quia omnia quae amoris mutui sunt, se habent in caelis sicut 
consanguinitates et affinitates, ita sicut 'familiae,' de quibus videatur n. 685; quare in Verbo illa quae amoris aut charitatis sunt, exprimuntur per 'domos' ut et per 'familias,' quibus confirmandis 
hic non immorandum; quod 'domus' significet talia, videatur n. 710.  [3] Quod 'gentes' significent utrumque in communi, constat ex significatione 'gentis seu gentium' in Verbo; gentes in bono sensu 
significant voluntaria et intellectualia nova, proinde bona amoris et vera fidei; at in sensu opposito significant mala et falsa; similiter etiam 'domus, familiae, linguae,' quod permultis confirmari 
potest a Verbo; causa est quia Antiquissima Ecclesia distincta fuit in domos, in familias, et in gentes; domum constituerunt conjuges cum liberis et cum servis et ancillis; familiam constituerunt plures 
domus quae non longe ab invicem distabant; gentes autem constituerunt plures familiae; inde gentes significabant in uno complexu omnes familias simul; similiter se habet in caelo, sed omnium respectus 
ibi est quoad amorem et fidem in Dominum, n. 685.  [4] Inde nunc significatio 'gentium' in sensu interno, quod sit commune complectens tam voluntaria quam intellectualia, seu quod idem est, tam quae 
sunt amoris quam quae sunt fidei, respective ad familias et domos ex quibus; de his videantur etiam quae prius n. 470, 471, 483.  Ex his constat quod 'gentes' significent utrumque in communi; et quod 
'quaelibet juxta linguam suam, juxta familias suas, et quoad gentes suas' significent genium cujusvis hominis, familiae, gentis, ad quam cultus ab Ecclesia Antiqua derivatus est.$@ </p>
