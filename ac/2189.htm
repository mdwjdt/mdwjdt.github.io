<h3 align="center" class="ired">属天的奥秘 第2189节</h3>
<h4 align="center"></h4><p><strong>2189.</strong>“他们对亚伯拉罕说，你妻子撒拉在哪里”表理性真理，那时它因存在于理性良善中而未显现。这从“撒拉”的代表清楚可知，“撒拉”在此是指理性真理，如前所述（<a href="2173.htm">2173</a>节）。这些事物的含义，和随着所论述主所具有的理性状态，也就是撒拉所代表的状态而来的那些事物一样，无法轻易理性解释清楚，除非人们知道就良善与真理而言，理性状态的一般性质是什么；以及对主而言，就神性和那时祂所在的人性而言，理性状态的一般性质又是什么。<br />人类理性的首要元素是真理，如前所述（<a href="2072.htm">2072</a>节）。因此，正是人所具有的对真理的情感使得他得以改造和重生，这种改造是通过属于真理的认知和知识实现的。这些不断被植入在良善，即仁爱中，以便他能以这种方式接受仁爱的生命。在人类理性中，对真理的情感占主要部分。因为仁爱的生命，就是天堂本身的生命，情况是这样：在凡正经历改造和重生的人里面，这生命不断生出、发展和增加，这种成长凭真理实现。故所植入的真理越多，仁爱的生命就越得以完善。因此，人所具有真理的质和量如何，他所具有的仁爱就如何。<br />所有这一切可在某种程度上表明人类理性是何情形。然而，生命并不存在于真理中，只存在于良善中。真理不过是生命，即良善的接受者，就像良善所穿的衣服或外衣。故在圣言中，真理被称作衣服和外衣。但当良善构成理性时，真理就消失不见了，并变得好像它就是良善；因为此时良善正透过真理而闪耀，这和发生在天使身上的情形一样。当天使身穿衣服显现时，他们会出现在看似一件衣服的亮光中，这也是天使出现在众先知面前的情形。<br />这就是所给出的这一解读的含义，即那时理性真理未显现，因为它存在于理性良善中，就是“他们对亚伯拉罕说，你妻子撒拉在哪里”所表示的。但由于当时主的理性是任何天使永远不可能具备的神性，所以它只能通过类比来描述，因而通过类似但不一样的事物来说明。</p>

They said unto him, Where is Sarah thy wife? That this signifies rational truth, which did not then appear because it was in rational good, is evident from the representation here of Sarah, as being 
rational truth (spoken of above, n. 2173). How the case is with these things, as also with those which follow, where the state of the rational with the Lord is treated of, which is represented by Sarah, 
cannot be so well explained to the understanding unless it is known what in general is the state of the rational as to good and as to truth; and with the Lord, as to the Divine and as to the Human 
in which He then was.  [2] The primary thing of the rational with man is truth (as before said, n. 2072), consequently it is the affection of truth, to the end that man may be reformed, and so regenerated. 
This is effected by means of knowledges [cognitiones et scientifica] that are of truth, which are continually being implanted in good, that is, in charity, that so the man may receive the life 
of charity. It is on this account that the affection of truth in man is predominant in his rational. For it is the case with the life of charity (which is the heavenly life itself) that with those who 
are being reformed and regenerated it is continually being born and growing up and receiving increments, and this by means of truths; therefore the more of truth there is insinuated, the more is the 
life of charity perfected; wherefore according to the quality and quantity of truth, so is the charity with a man. [3] From all this it may in some measure be evident how the case is with man's rational. 
In truth, however, there is no life, but in good. Truth is only a recipient of life, that is, of good. Truth is as the clothing or garment of good; therefore also truths are called in the Word "clothing," 
and also "garments." But when good constitutes the rational, truth disappears and becomes as if it were good. Good then shines through the truth, in the same way as takes place with the angels, 
for when they appear clothed, it is a brightness inducing the appearance of raiment, as was the case also when angels appeared before the prophets. [4] This then is what is meant by rational truth 
not then appearing because it was in rational good, and which is signified by their saying to him, "Where is Sarah thy wife?" But as the Lord's rational good was then Divine, such as it can be with 
no angel, it cannot be described otherwise than by comparison, and thus by illustration from something similar, and which is not the same. </p>

<p align="center"><b>Elliott(1983-1999) 2189</b></p><p><b>2189.</b>
They said to him, Where is Sarah your wife? means rational truth, which did not at that time show itself because it existed within rational good. This is clear from the representation of 'Sarah' here 
as rational truth, dealt with above in <a href="2173.htm">2173</a>. The implications of these things - as also of those that follow where the state of the Lord's Rational is the subject, which state is represented by 'Sarah' 
- cannot so easily be explained intelligibly unless the general nature of the state of the rational as regards good and as regards truth is known; and also in the Lord's case as regards the Divine 
and as regards the Human in which He was at that time. </p>
<p></p>
<p><b>[2]</b>
 The first and foremost element of the rational with man is truth, as stated already in <a href="2072.htm">2072</a>, and therefore it is the affection for truth, 
which exists with man to enable him to be reformed and so regenerated, such reformation being effected by means of cognitions and facts, which are matters of truth. These are being constantly implanted 
in good, that is, in charity, so that in this manner he may receive the life of charity. It is therefore the affection for truth with man that predominates in his rational. For the situation with the 
life of charity, which is the life of heaven itself, is that in people who are being reformed and regenerated it is constantly being born and developing and increasing, such growth being achieved by 
means of truths. Therefore the more truth that is implanted, the more is the life of charity perfected. Thus as is the nature and the amount of truth present with man, so is the charity present with 
him. </p>
<p></p>
<p><b>[3]</b>
 These few observations may to some extent show what the position is with man's rational. Within truth however no life is present, only within good. Truth is merely the recipient of life, that 
is, of good. Truth is like the clothing or a garment worn by good. In the Word too therefore truths are called clothes, and also garments. But when good composes the rational, truth passes out of 
sight and becomes as though it was good; for good is now shining through the truth, in the same way as when angels are seen clothed they appear in brightness that looks like a garment, as also was the 
case when angels appeared before the prophets. </p>
<p></p>
<p><b>[4]</b>
 These then are the implications of the explanation given, that rational truth did not at that time show itself because it existed within rational 
good, meant by 'they said to him, Where is Sarah your wife?' But because the Lord's Rational Good at that time was Divine, as it can never be with any angel, it cannot be described other than by the 
use of a comparison, thus by the use of an illustration presenting something similar but not the same. </p>

`Dixerunt ad illum, Ubi Sarah uxor tua?': quod significet rationale verum, quod tunc non apparuit quia in bono rationali fuit, constat a repraesentatione `Sarae' hic quod sit rationale verum, de qua 
supra n. 2173.  Quomodo haec se habent, tum quoque sequentia ubi de statu Rationalis apud Dominum, qui [status] repraesentatur per `Sarah,' non ita ad intellectum explicari potest nisi sciatur qualis 
in genere sit status rationalis quoad bonum et quoad verum; tum apud Dominum quoad Divinum et quoad Humanum in quo tunc fuit: [2] primarium rationalis apud hominem est verum, ut prius n. 2072 dictum, 
proinde est affectio veri, ob causam ut reformari possit homo: et sic regenerari, quod fit per cognitiones et scientifica quae sunt veri; quae continue {1} implantantur in bono, hoc est, in charitate, 
ut sic accipiat vitam charitatis; ideo est quod affectio veri apud hominem praedominetur in ejus rationali; se enim ita habet cum vita charitatis quae est ipsa vita caelestis, quod apud illos qui reformantur 
(c)et regenerantur, illa continue nascatur et adolescat, et incrementa capiat, et hoc per vera, ideo quo plus veri `insinuatur, eo plus perficitur vita charitatis, quare secundum veri qualitatem 
et quantitatem, se habet charitas apud hominem.  [3] Ex his constare aliquatenus potest quomodo se habet cum rationali hominis: at in vero non est vita, sed in bono; verum est modo recipiens vitae, 
hoc est, boni; verum est sicut indumentum aut vestimentum boni; ideo etiam vera in Verbo vocantur `indumenta,' ut et `vestes'; cum autem bonum constituit rationale, tunc disparatur verum, et fit sicut 
sit bonum, {2} bonum tunc translucet per verum, quemadmodum fit apud angelos qui cum induti apparent, est splendor inducens speciem vestis, quales etiam apparuerunt angeli coram prophetis.  [4] Haec 
nunc sunt quae intelliguntur per quod rationale verum tunc non apparuerit quia in bono rationali fuit, quae significata per quod `dixerunt ad illum, Ubi Sarah uxor tua?' sed quia Bonum Rationale Domini 
tunc fuit Divinum, quale apud nullum angelum potest esse, non describi potest aliter ac per comparationem, ita per illustrationem a quodam simili quod non est idem. 	@1 i a Domino.$ 	@2 i nam.$ </p>
