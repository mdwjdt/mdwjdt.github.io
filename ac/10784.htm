<h3 align="center" class="ired">属天的奥秘 第10784节</h3>
<h4 align="center"></h4><p><strong>10784</strong>.在路上或旅程中，我被允许观察主为天使提供的天堂何等浩瀚。根据无人居住的地方，我被允许推断它如此浩瀚，以致即便有数百万颗星球，每个星球的人口都和我们的一样多，还是会有一个地方给他们，直到永远；它永远不会填满。我对比了围绕并服务我们地球的天堂面积之后，能够推断出这一点。</p>

On the way, or during this progression, it was given me to observe how immense is the Lord's heaven that is for the angels. For from the regions not inhabited it was given me to conclude that it is so 
immense that if there were many myriads of earths, and in each as great a multitude of men as in our own, still there would be room for them to eternity, and it would never be filled. This I could conclude 
from a comparison made with the extent of the heaven which is about our earth, and for it. </p>

On the way or during that journey I was allowed to observe how vast was the Lord's heaven provided for angels. For from the uninhabited places I was allowed to deduce that it was so vast that even if 
millions of planets existed and the population on each of them was as great as that on ours, a place would always be there for them; it would never be filled. This I was able to deduce after I had compared 
it with the extent of the heaven which surrounds and serves our planet.  </p>

In via seu progressione illa observare dabatur quam immensum esset caelum Domini quod pro angelis; ex non habitatis enim concludere dabatur quod tam immensum esset ut si darentur plures myriades tellurum, 
et in qualibet tanta multitudo hominum quanta in nostra, quod usque locus foret pro illis in aeternum, et nusquam impleretur; hoc concludere potui ex comparatione facta cum extensione caeli quod 
circum nostram tellurem, et pro illa. </p>
