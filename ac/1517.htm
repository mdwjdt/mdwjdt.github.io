<h4 align="center"></h4><p><strong>1517.</strong>我曾闻到过葡萄酒的气味，得知它来自那些出于友谊和正当的爱而彼此赞赏的人，因此，他们的赞赏中也包含真理。这气味多种多样，源自真正彬彬有礼的气场。</p><br />

<p><strong>[NCE]1517.</strong> I once smelled a wine smell and learned that it came from those who ingratiate themselves with others in a spirit of affability and bona fide love, so that their compliments also contain some truth. This fragrance has many variations and arises from an atmosphere of polished charm.{*1} <br /><strong>Footnotes:</strong><br />{*1} The value implicitly assigned to "a spirit of affability" and "polished charm" was a hallmark of Swedenborg's era. The eighteenth century was a time of radical changes in etiquette, in which types of behavior that previously characterized the aristocracy were diffused into wider classes of society. Most of this process was secular in impulse (the result of the bourgeois imitating the nobility), but as is suggested here, certain Christian authorities regarded decency and civility as a spiritual virtue related to charity and love for one's neighbor. See Elias 1978, 99-113. [RS] </p>

A vinous odor was perceived, and I was informed that it came from those who compliment one another from friendship and rightful love, so that there is also truth in the compliments. This odor exists 
with much variety, and comes from the sphere of the beautiful in forms. </p>

<p align="center"><b>Elliott(1983-1999) 1517</b></p><p><b>1517.</b>
I once perceived an odor of wine, and I was told that it came from those who, out of friendship and love that is lawful, endear themselves, so that truth also is contained within their endearing words 
and actions. There is much variety of this odor, and it derives from the sphere of true courteousness. </p>

<p align="center"><b>Latin(1748-1756) 1517</b>
</p><b>1517.</b>
Odor vinosus sentitus, et informatus quod esset ab illis qui ex amicitia et amore licito adblandiuntur, sic ut adblandimentis quoque verum insit: hic odor est cum multa varietate, estque ex sphaera 
pulchri formalis. </p>
