<h3 align="center" class="ired">属天的奥秘 第7849节</h3>
<h4 align="center"></h4><p><strong>7849.</strong>“吃羔羊的”表享受。这从“吃”的含义清楚可知，“吃”是指变成人自己的（参看<a href="3168.htm">3168</a>，<a href="3513.htm">3513</a>e，<a href="4745.htm">4745</a>节），但在此是指享受，因为所论述的主题是启动的状态。此中情形是这样：当那些在主降临之前被关在低地（<a href="6854.htm">6854</a>，<a href="6914.htm">6914</a>，<a href="7091.htm">7091</a>e，<a href="7828.htm">7828</a>节）的人即将被释放时，他们不得不预备接受来自主的良善与真理的流注，因为他们要穿过地狱的中间。当他们穿过时，为防止邪恶与虚假从周围的地狱灵流入，他们不得不做好预备，好处于真理与良善的全备状态。蒙主的神性怜悯，我们在下文会谈到这种穿过。在这月初十日和十四日之间所要做，并且在吃逾越节的羔羊方面所要遵守的事就描述了进入接受良善与真理的状态的这种预备或启动。</p>

In which they shall eat it. That this signifies enjoyment, is evident from the signification of "eating," as being appropriation (see n. 3168, 3513, 4745), but here enjoyment, because a state of initiation 
is treated of. The case herein is this: when those who before the Lord's coming had been detained in custody in the lower earth (n. 6854, 6914, 7091, 7828) were to be liberated, they had to be 
prepared to receive the influx of good and truth from the Lord, for they were to pass through the midst of hell; and lest in that passage evils and falsities should flow in from the infernal spirits round 
about, they had to be prepared, so that they might then be in a full state of truth and good. But of the Lord's Divine mercy that passage shall be spoken of in what follows. This preparation, or 
initiation to a state of reception of good and truth, is described by the things which were to be done between the tenth day of the month and the fourteenth day, and which were to be observed in respect 
to the eating of the paschal lamb. </p>

<p align="center"><b>Elliott(1983-1999) 7849</b></p><p><b>7849.</b>
'In which they will eat it' means enjoyment. This is clear from the meaning of 'eating' as making one's own, dealt with in <a href="3168.htm">3168</a>, <a href="3513.htm">3513</a> (end), <a href="4745.htm">4745</a>, but at this point enjoyment since the subject is the 
state of initiation. The situation is this: When those who had been held back in safe keeping on the lower earth before the Lord's Coming - <a href="6854.htm">6854</a>, <a href="6914.htm">6914</a>, <a href="7091.htm">7091</a> (end), <a href="7828.htm">7828</a> - were about to be delivered they 
had to be made ready to receive the inflow of goodness and truth from the Lord; for they were going to pass through the midst of hell. And to guard, as they passed through, against any inflow of evils 
and falsities from hellish spirits round about, they had to be made ready so that when they went through they would be fully equipped with truth and good. But this passage through hell will in the 
Lord's Divine mercy be spoken about later on. That preparation or initiation into a state when goodness and truth were received is described by the things they were to do between the tenth day of the 
month and the fourteenth, and were to observe in connection with the eating of the Passover lamb. </p>

`In quibus comedent eam': quod significet fruitionem, constat ex significatione `comedere' quod sit appropriatio, de qua n. 3168, 3513 fin., 4745, hic autem fruitio, quia agitur de statu initiationis 
{1}.  (s)Hoc ita se habet: qui ante Adventum Domini in terra inferiore, in custodia detenti fuerunt, n. 6854, 6914, 7091 fin., 7828, cum liberarentur, praeparandi erant ad recipiendum influxum boni 
et veri a Domino, nam transirent per medium infernum; et ne in illo transitu ex infernalibus circum circa influerent mala et falsa, idcirco praeparandi erant ut tunc in pleno statu veri et boni essent; 
sed de illo transitu in sequentibus {2}, ex Divina Domini Misericordia, {3}dicetur; praeparatio illa seu initiatio ad statum receptionis boni et veri describitur per illa quae facerent inter diem decimum 
mensis et quartum decimum, et quae observarent circa esum agni paschalis.(s) 	@1 i ad conjunctionem, ita de statu praeparationis ad appropriationem, quod de statu initiationis seu praeparationis 
agatur, videatur supra n. 7828$ 	@2 i plura$ 	@3 dicentur$ </p>
