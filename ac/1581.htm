<h3 align="center" class="ired">属天的奥秘 第1581节</h3>
<h4 align="center"></h4><p><strong>1581.</strong>“请你离开我”表良善不可能显现，除非不一致的东西化为乌有。这从刚才所述清楚可知，即内在人渴望外在人中与内在人不一致的东西从自己分离出去。若不分离出去，不断从内在人流入，即从主经由内在人流入的良善就无法显现。然而，至于这种分离，要知道，这不是分离，而是沉寂。除了主以外，对所有人而言，外在人中的邪恶无法被分离出去。因为人一旦获得某物，它就会保留下来；当沉寂时，它看似被分离出去，因为当沉寂时，它似乎化为乌有。此外，唯独主能使它如此沉寂，以至于看似化为乌有。当它如此沉寂下来时，良善才第一次从主流入，并驱动外在人。这就是天使的状态；他们只知道邪恶已从他们那里被分离出去，而事实上，这只是对邪恶的一种抑制，因而是一种沉寂，以致它看似化为乌有。所以，这是一种表象，天使在反思这个问题，也认识到这一点。</p><br />

<p><strong>[NCE]1581.</strong> Please separate from me means that nothing good can appear unless discordant factors cease to exist. This can be seen from the remarks just above: that the inner self wants discordant factors in the outer self to separate because none of the benefits that constantly flow in from the inner self (or rather from the Lord through the inner self) can appear until those factors leave.<br />In regard to separation, we need to see that it is not a separation but a muting. In no one but the Lord can the evil in the outer self be entirely removed. Once we have acquired any, it remains. When it quiets down, though, it seems to go away, since it seems nonexistent. It does not quiet down to this point unless the Lord quiets it for us, but when it does, then good things first flow in from the Lord and affect our outer self.<br />This is the stage that the angels have reached. For all they can see, evil has separated from them, but in reality their situation is merely one of being withheld from evil and so one in which evil is muted to the point where it seems nonexistent. It is a mirage, then, and this the angels realize when they reflect on it. </p>

Separate, I pray, from me. That this signifies that the good cannot appear unless what is discordant is made null is evident from what has just been said; namely, that the internal man desires that which 
disagrees, in the external man, should separate itself; for until it has been separated, the good which continually flows in from the internal man, that is, from the Lord through the internal man, 
cannot appear. But as regards this separation, it is to be known that it is not separation, but quiescence. With no one, except the Lord, can the evil that is in the external man be separated. Whatever 
a man has once acquired, remains; but it seems to be separated when it is quiescent, for thus it appears to be none. Neither does it become quiescent so as to appear as none, except from the Lord; 
and when it does thus become quiescent, then for the first time do goods flow in from the Lord, and affect the external man. Such is the state of the angels; nor do they know otherwise than that evil 
has been separated from them; whereas there is only a withholding from the evil, thus a quiescence, so that it appears as none; consequently this is an appearance, as also the angels know when they reflect. </p>

<p align="center"><b>Elliott(1983-1999) 1581</b></p><p><b>1581.</b>
That 'separate yourself, now, from me' means that it cannot manifest itself unless that which does not accord is reduced to nothing is clear from what has now been stated, namely that the internal man 
wants that in the external which does not agree with the internal to separate itself. For until it has been separated the good which flows in constantly from the internal man, that is, from the Lord 
by way of the internal man, cannot manifest itself. With regard to the separation however it should be realized that it is not a separating but a dying down. In nobody with the exception of the Lord 
can evil that is in the external man be separated, for once a person has acquired something it stays with him. But it does seem to be separated when it dies down, for when it dies down it seems to be 
reduced to nothing. Moreover it is the Lord alone who is responsible for it so dying down as to be seemingly reduced to nothing. And when it does in this way die down, goods for the first time flow in 
from the Lord and move the external man. The state in which angels live is such as this. All they are conscious of is that evil has been separated from them, but in fact it is purely a withholding from 
evil and thus a dying down in such a way as to be seemingly reduced to nothing. Consequently it is an appearance, which angels also recognize when they reflect on the matter. </p>

</p><b>1581.</b>
Quod 'separare quaeso a me' significet quod apparere nequeat nisi quod discors est, nullum fiat, constat ab illis quae nunc dicta sunt, quod nempe internus homo velit ut illud se separet in externo 
homine quod discordat; nam antequam separatum est, non apparere potest bonum quod continue influit ab interno homine, hoc est, per internum hominem a Domino: quod autem separationem attinet, sciendum 
quod non sit separatio sed quod sit quiescentia; malum quod in externo homine, apud nullum hominem praeter apud Dominum, separari potest; quicquid semel acquisivit homo, remanet; sed separari videtur 
tum quiescit, sic enim ut nullum apparet; nec quiescit ita ut sicut nullum appareat, nisi a Domino; et cum quiescit ita, tunc primum influunt bona a Domino, et sciunt externum hominem: talis est status 
angelorum; illi nec sciunt aliter ac quod malum separatum sit ab illis, sed est solum detentio a malo, ita quiescentia ut sicut nullum appareat, proinde est apparentia, quod etiam sciunt angeli cum 
reflectunt. </p>
