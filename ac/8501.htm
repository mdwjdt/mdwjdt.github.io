<h3 align="center" class="ired">属天的奥秘 第8501节</h3>
<h4 align="center"></h4><p><strong>8501.</strong>出埃及记16:25-27.摩西说，你们今天吃这个吧！因为今天是向耶和华守的安息日，今天你们在田野必找不着了。六天可以收集它，第七天乃是安息日，那一天必没有了。第七天百姓中有人出去收集，什么也找不着。<br />“摩西说”表关于这个问题的指示。“你们今天吃这个吧”表把它永远变成他们自己的。“因为今天是向耶和华守的安息日”表因为主已经将良善与真理联结起来。“今天你们在田野必找不着了”表这时良善必不再通过真理获得。“六天可以收集它”表在真理与良善结合之前，对真理的领受。“第七天乃是安息日”表此后就有结合。“那一天必没有了”表必不再有通过真理所获得的良善。“第七天”表已结合的良善和真理的一种状态。“百姓中有人出去收集，什么也找不着”表他们想要获得它，但这是不可能的。</p>

Verses 25-27. And Moses said, Eat ye this today, because today is a Sabbath to Jehovah, today ye shall not find it in the field. Six days ye shall gather it, and on the seventh day is the Sabbath, it 
shall not be in it. And it was on the seventh day, there went out some of the people for to gather, and they found none. "And Moses said," signifies information concerning this matter; "Eat ye this today," 
signifies appropriation to eternity; "because today is a Sabbath to Jehovah," signifies because good has been conjoined with truth by the Lord; "today ye shall not find it in the field," signifies 
that then good shall no longer be acquired by means of truth; "six days ye shall gather it," signifies the reception of truth before it is being conjoined with good; "and on the seventh day is the 
Sabbath," signifies that afterward there is conjunction; "it shall not be in it," signifies that no longer shall there be good by means of truth; "and it was on the seventh day," signifies a state of 
conjoined good and truth; "there went out some of the people for to gather, and they found none," signifies that they desired to acquire, but it was not possible. </p>

Verses 25-27 And Moses said, Eat it today, because today is a sabbath to Jehovah; today you will not find it in the field. Six days you shall gather it; and on the seventh day, the sabbath, there will 
be none in it. And so it was on the seventh day, that some of the people went out to gather, and did not find. </p>
<p>'And Moses said' means instructions regarding this matter. 'Eat it today' means making 
it their own for ever. 'Because today is a sabbath to Jehovah' means because good has been joined to truth by the Lord. 'Today you will not find it in the field' means that then there will no longer 
be any acquiring of good through truth. 'Six days you shall gather it' means the acceptance of truth before it is joined to good. 'And on the seventh day, the sabbath' means that after this comes the 
joining together. 'There will be none in it' means that no longer will there be good acquired through truth. 'And so it was on the seventh day' means a state when good and truth have been joined together. 
'That some of the people went out to gather, and did not find' means that they wished to acquire it, but none was given. </p>

Vers. 25-27.  Et dixit Moscheh, Comedite illud hodie, quia sabbatum hodie Jehovae; hodie non {1}invenietis illud in agro.  Sex diebus colligetis illud, et in die septimo sabbatum, non erit in eo.  Et 
fuit in die septimo exiverunt e populo ad colligendum, et non invenerunt.  `Et dixit Moscheh' significat informationem de hac re: `Comedite illud hodie' significat appropriationem in aeternum: `quia 
sabbatum hodie Jehovae' significat quia conjunctum est bonum vero a Domino: `hodie non {1}invenietis illud in agro' significat quod tunc non amplius acquiretur bonum per verum: `sex diebus colligetis 
illud' significat receptionem veri antequam conjungitur bono: `et in die septimo sabbatum' significat quod postea conjunctio: `non erit in eo' significat quod non amplius bonum per verum: `et fuit in 
die septimo' significat statum conjuncti boni et veri: `exiverunt e populo ad colligendum, et non (x)invenerunt' significat quod acquirere vellent, sed non datum. 	@1 invenietur IT$ </p>
