<h3 align="center" class="ired">属天的奥秘 第5316节</h3>
<h4 align="center"></h4><p><strong>5316.</strong>“看，我派你治理埃及全地”表掌管属世层的这两个部分的权柄。这从“派人治理”和“埃及全地”的含义清楚可知：“派人治理”是指掌管的权柄；“埃及全地”是指属世层的这两个部分，如前所述（<a href="5276.htm">5276</a>节）。这进一步论述了法老所给予约瑟掌管埃及地的权柄。也就是说，法老放弃自己的权柄，将整个埃及交在约瑟之下。这些事都是按神的旨意发生的，好叫约瑟可以披上主在世时所拥有的属灵层的属天层的代表；主通过这属灵层的属天层掌控祂的属世层和感官层，以便祂一步一步地将这二者变成神性。这一切发生在约瑟身上，目的是为了以约瑟为主题所要写的圣言部分能包含神性事物，因而包含诸如在天堂里最为神圣、适合天上天使的那类事物。那里的天使住在主里面，因为他们活在从主发出的神性真理的气场里面。因此，在圣言的内义中，涉及主和祂人身得荣耀的神性事物在他们里面激起如此多的情感，以致他们感受到属其智慧和聪明的一切幸福。</p>

<p align="center"><b>Potts(1905-1910) 5316</b></p><p><b>5316.</b>
See, I have set thee over all the land of Egypt. That this signifies dominion over both naturals, is evident from the signification of "setting anyone over" as being dominion; and from the signification 
of "all the land of Egypt," as being both naturals (of which above, n. 5276). This treats still further of the dominion that Pharaoh gave Joseph over the land of Egypt, namely, that Pharaoh deprived 
himself of his own authority, and put all Egypt under Joseph. These things were so done of the Divine Providence, in order that Joseph might put on the representation of the celestial of the spiritual 
the Lord had when He was in the world, and by means of which He disposed His natural and also His sensuous, in order that progressively He might make them both Divine. This was done to Joseph to the 
end that the Word that was to be written about him might contain Divine things, thus such things as in the heavens are most holy and are suited to the angels who are in the heavens; for the angels 
there are in the Lord, because they are in the sphere of the Divine truth proceeding from Him; and therefore the Divine things in the Word's internal sense relative to the Lord and to the glorification 
of His Human so greatly affect them that they perceive thence all the blessedness of their wisdom and intelligence. </p>

'See, I have set you over all the land of Egypt' means dominion over both parts of the natural. This is clear from the meaning of 'setting someone over' as dominion, and from the meaning of 'all the 
land of Egypt' as both parts of the natural, dealt with above in <a href="5276.htm">5276</a>. Described at greater length here is the dominion which Pharaoh transferred to Joseph over the land of Egypt. That is to say, Pharaoh 
divested himself of his own authority and placed the whole of Egypt under Joseph. These events happened by Divine Providence so that Joseph might come to represent the celestial of the spiritual which 
was the Lord's when He was in the world - the celestial of the spiritual being that by means of which the Lord exercised control over His natural and also His sensory awareness, so that step by step 
He could make both of these Divine. The end in view with what happened to Joseph was this: When that part of the Word in which Joseph was the subject came to be written it was to contain Divine matters, 
thus such matters as are most sacred in heaven and suited to the angels in heaven. For the angels there abide in the Lord because they live within the sphere of Divine Truth that goes forth from 
the Lord. Therefore the Divine matters in the internal sense of the Word which have to do with the Lord and the glorification of His Human stir so much affection in them that they feel all the blessedness 
that belongs to their wisdom and intelligence. </p>

`Vide, dedi te super omnem terram Aegypti':  quod significet dominium super utrumque naturale, constat (e)ex significatione `dare aliquem super' quod sit dominium; et ex significatione `omnis terrae 
Aegypti' quod sit utrumque naturale, de qua supra n. 5276. Agitur {1} adhuc amplius de {2}dominio quod Pharaoh tradidit Josepho super terram Aegypti, quod nempe Pharaoh semet potestate sua deprivaverit, 
et totam Aegyptum Josepho submiserit; quae ita ex Providentia Divina facta sunt ut `Josephus' indueret repraesentationem caelestis spiritualis quod Domino cum in mundo fuit, et per quod Dominus naturale 
Suum et quoque sensuale, disposuit, ut utrumque successive Divinum faceret; hoc factum est ob finem ut Verbum quod de Josepho scriberetur, contineret Divina, ita talia quae in caelis sanctissima 
sunt et quae angelis qui in caelis, conveniunt; sunt enim angeli ibi in Domino, quia in sphaera Divini Veri procedentis a Domino, quapropter Divina quae de Domino et de Ipsius Humani glorificatione 
in sensu interno Verbi sunt, illos afficiunt in tantum ut (t)inde percipiant omne beatum sapientiae et intelligentiae suae.   @1 i nunc$ @2 domino I$   </p>
