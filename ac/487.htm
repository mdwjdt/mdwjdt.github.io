<h3 align="center" class="ired">属天的奥秘 第487节</h3>
<h4 align="center"></h4><p><strong>487.</strong>“日子”表总体的时间与状态，这在第一章已经说明，“创造的日子”在那里没有别的意思。在圣言中，一整个时代被称为“一日”司空见惯，如本节以及下面的5、8、11、14、17、20、23、27、31节所体现的那样。因此，总体上属时间的状态也以“日子”来表示。当加上“年“时，年期就表示那些状态的性质，因此表示具体的状态。<br />上古之人用自己特有的数字来表示教会的不同方面，例如，数字3、7、10、12，以及由这些和其它数字组合的许多数字，他们以此来描述教会的各个状态。所以，这些数字隐藏着奥秘，这些奥秘需花大量精力来解开。实际上，一个数字就是对教会状态的一个估算。圣言通篇都有这样的特征，尤其是先知书。犹太教会的宗教仪式也牵涉数字，既指时间也指量；例如，涉及献祭、供物和祭品以及其它事物的数字处处特指圣物。因此，本节经文中的数字“八百”和下一节的“九百三十”，甚至接下来各节中出现的数字所象征的具体事项难以尽述，这些事项与其教会状态的变化有关，这些变化涉及他们自己的总体状态。蒙主慈悲，“十二”以内简单数字的含义将在本书后面部分借机予以说明，若不首先了解这些，就不可能理解复合数字的含义。</p>

<p><strong>[NCE]487.</strong> The symbolism of days as those times and states in general was shown in the first chapter [<a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_487/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_23" target=_top>23</a>], where the days of creation symbolize nothing else.<br />It is very common for the Word to call all units of time "days."{*1} In this verse the practice is quite obvious, as it also is in verses <a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_487/bible_king-james-version_genesis_5_5" target=_top>5</a>, <a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_487/bible_king-james-version_genesis_5_8" target=_top>8</a>, <a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_487/bible_king-james-version_genesis_5_11" target=_top>11</a>, <a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_487/bible_king-james-version_genesis_5_14" target=_top>14</a>, <a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_487/bible_king-james-version_genesis_5_17" target=_top>17</a>, <a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_487/bible_king-james-version_genesis_5_20" target=_top>20</a>, <a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_487/bible_king-james-version_genesis_5_23" target=_top>23</a>, <a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_487/bible_king-james-version_genesis_5_27" target=_top>27</a>, and 31 below. The general states at those times accordingly are symbolized by days as well. When years are mentioned in conjunction with days, the time spans represented by those years symbolize the nature of the states then; in other words, they symbolize the specific states.<br />[2] The earliest people had particular numbers they used for symbolizing various aspects of the church: three, seven, ten, twelve, and additional ones that they compounded out of these and others. This allowed them to sum up the states of the church. As a result, these numbers contain hidden wisdom that would require a long explanation. It was a way of evaluating different states in the church.<br />The same phenomenon occurs at many other places in the Word, especially in the prophets. In the rites of the Jewish religion there are also numbers for both timing and measurement in connection with sacrifices, minhas,{*2} oblations, and other acts of worship; and everywhere those numbers occur they symbolize holiness in the thing they are applied to.<br />What these numbers specifically involve, then — the eight hundred in this verse, the nine hundred thirty in the next, and so on for the numbers of years in the following verses — is more than I can ever convey. They all come down to changes in the state of religion among those people, seen in relation to their general state.<br />Later on, by the Lord's divine mercy, I will need to tell what the simple numbers up to twelve symbolize.{*3} Unless this is known first, the symbolism of their products cannot be grasped.<br /><br /><strong>Footnotes:</strong><br />{*1} See, for example, <a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_487/bible_king-james-version_ezekiel_4_6" target=_top>Ezekiel 4:6</a>, which explicitly equates a day with a year.

That by "days" are signified times and states in general, was shown in the first chapter, where the "days" of creation have no other signification. In the Word it is very usual to call all time "days" 
as is manifestly the case in the present verse, and in those which follow (5, 8, 11, 14, 17, 20, 23, 27, 31); and therefore the states of the times in general are likewise signified by "days;" and when 
"years" are added, then by the seasons of the years are signified the qualities of the states, thus states in special. The most ancient people had their numbers, by which they signified various things 
relating to the church, as the numbers "three" "seven" "ten" "twelve" and many that were compounded of these and others, whereby they described the states of the church; wherefore these numbers contain 
arcana which would require much time to explain. It was an account or reckoning of the states of the church. The same thing occurs in many parts of the Word, especially the prophetical. In the 
rites of the Jewish Church also there were numbers, both of times and measures, as for instance in regard to the sacrifices, meat-offerings, oblations, and other things, which everywhere signify holy 
things, according to their application. The things here involved, therefore, in the number "eight hundred" and in the next verse, in the number "nine hundred and thirty" and in the numbers of years in 
the verses following-namely, the changes of state of their church as applied to their own general state-are too many to be recounted. In a future part of this work, of the Lord's Divine mercy we shall 
take occasion to show what the simple numbers up to "twelve" signify, for until the signification of these is known, it would be impossible to apprehend the signification of the compound numbers. </p>

'Days means periods of time and states in general. This has been shown in Chapter <a href="1.htm">1</a>, where the 'days of creation have no other meaning. In the Word it is very common for a whole period of time to be 
called 'a day', as it clearly is in the present verse and in verses 5, 8, 11, 14, 17, 20, 23, 27, 31, below; and therefore the states that belong to periods of time in general are meant by 'days as well. 
And when 'years' is attached, then periods of years meant he natures of those states, and so the states in particular.  </p>
<p></p>
<p><b>[2]</b>
 The most ancient people had their own particular numbers which they would 
use to mean different aspects of the Church - for instance, the numbers three, seven, ten, twelve, and many which they obtained from these and other numbers - and in so doing incorporated states 
of the Church. These numbers therefore contain arcana that would require considerable effort to unravel. Really a number was an evaluation of the states of the Church. The same feature occurs throughout 
the Word, especially in the prophetical. And the religious ceremonies of the Jewish Church also entail numbers specifying periods of time as well as quantities; for example, in connection with sacrifices, 
minchahs, oblations, and other practices, which in every case have special reference to holy things. Consequently eight hundred in this verse, nine hundred and thirty in the next, and the numbers 
of years mentioned in the verses that follow after that, embody in particular more matters than can possibly be retold; matters, that is to say, which have to do with changes in the state of their 
Church in relationship to their own general state. Later on, in the Lord's Divine mercy, the meaning of the simple numbers up to twelve will be given, for without knowing these first of all no one can 
grasp what compound numbers mean.  </p>

Quod per 'dies' significentur tempora et status in genere in capite primo ostensum est, ubi 'dies creationis' nihil aliud significant communissimum est in Verbo omne tempus appellare 'dies,' sicut hic 
manifeste, inque vers. seq. 5, 8, 11, 14, 17, 20, 23, 27, 31; quare etiam status temporum in genere quoque per 'dies' significantur; cumque adjiciuntur anni, tunc per annorum tempora significantur 
quales status, ita status in specie.  [2] Antiquissimi habebant suos numeros per quos significabant varia Ecclesiae, sicut numeros tres, septem, decem duodecim, et plures quos ex illis et aliis componebant, 
et sic comprehendebant status Ecclesiae; quare numeri hi arcana continent, quae explicare multis opus; erat computus statuum Ecclesiae; etiam passim simile in Verbo, cumprimis prophetico, occurrit; 
etiam in ritibus Ecclesiae Judaicae sunt numeri tam temporum quam mensurarum ut circa sacrificia, minhas, oblationes et alia, qui ubivis significant sancta applicate; quare quae hic 'octingenti,' 
et in sequente versi 'nongenti et triginta,' et porro numeri annorum in sequentibus, in specie involvunt, sunt plura quam usquam tradi possunt; nempe mutationes status Ecclesiae illorum applicate ad 
statum eorum communem. In sequentibus, ex Divina Domini Misericordia, dicendum quid simplices numeri usque ad duodecim significant, qui nisi prius sciantur, non capi potest quid significant numeri 
compositi.
