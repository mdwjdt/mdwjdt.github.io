<h4 align="center"></h4><p><strong>4102.</strong>创世记31:17，18.雅各起来，把他的儿子和女眷都扶上骆驼。又带走他一切的产业，所积蓄的一切财物，他所买的产业，就是他在巴旦亚兰所积蓄的，往迦南地他父亲以撒那里去了。<br />“雅各起来”表“雅各”所表良善的提升。“把他的儿子和女眷都扶上骆驼”表真理和对它们的情感之提升，以及它们在一般事物里面的有序排列。“又带走他一切的产业，所积蓄的一切财物”表从拉班所属之物那里获得的真理与良善的分离。“他所买的产业”表藉着这些从其它源头所获得的事物。“就是他在巴旦亚兰所积蓄的”表对属世层里面的真理与良善的认知。“往迦南地他父亲以撒那里去了”表为了与理性层的神性良善结合，以便祂的人身能变成神性。</p>

Verses 17, 18. And Jacob arose, and lifted his sons and his women upon the camels. And he carried away all his acquisition, and all his substance which he had gathered, the acquisition of his purchase, 
which he had gathered in Paddan-aram, to go to Isaac his father in the land of Canaan. "And Jacob arose," signifies the elevation of the good meant by "Jacob;" "and lifted his sons and his women upon 
the camels," signifies the elevation of truths and of the affections of them, and their orderly arrangement in generals; "and he carried away all his acquisition and all his substance which he had 
gathered," signifies the separation of the truth and good derived from what was Laban's; "the acquisition of his purchase," signifies the things acquired by these from other sources; "which he had gathered 
in Paddan-aram," signifies the knowledges of truth and good in the natural; "to go to Isaac his father in the land of Canaan," signifies in order to be conjoined with the Divine good of the rational, 
to the intent that His human might be made Divine. </p>

<p>'Jacob rose up' means a raising up of the good meant by 'Jacob'. 'And set his sons and his womenfolk on camels' means 
a raising up of truths and of affections for these, and the arrangement of them within things that are general. 'And he brought away all his cattle and all his substance which he had gathered' means 
the separation of truth and good acquired from what belonged to Laban. 'The cattle he had purchased' means the things acquired by these from other sources. 'Which he had gathered in Paddan Aram' means 
cognitions of truth and good within the natural. 'To come to Isaac his father, to the land of Canaan' means so as to be joined to the Divine Good of the Rational, in order that the Human might be made 
Divine.

Vers. 17, 18.  Et surrexit Jacob, et sustulit filios suos et feminas suas, super camelos.  Et abduxit omnem acquisitionem suam, et omnem substantiam suam quam comparavit, acquisitionem emptionis 
suae, quam comparavit in Paddan Aram, ad veniendum ad Jishakum patrem suum terram Canaan. `Surrexit Jacob' significat elevationem boni per Jacobum intellecti: `et sustulit filios suos, et feminas suas, 
super aamelos' significat elevationem veritatum et affectionum illarum et ordinationem in communibus: `et abduxit omnem acquisitionem suam, et omnem substantiam suam quam comparavit' significat 
separationem {1} veri et boni a Labanis: </p>
<p>`acquisitionem emptionis suae' significat quae ab illis aliunde: </p>
<p>`quam comparavit in Paddan Aram' significat cognitiones veri et boni in naturali: `ad veniendum 
a Jishakum patrem suum terram Canaan' significat ad conjungendum Divino Bono Rationalis, ut Humanum Divinum fieret.      @1 A had separationem, vero boni et bono per Labanem intellecto, but 
alters to read thus. N. 4105 i quae sunt after boni.$ </p>
