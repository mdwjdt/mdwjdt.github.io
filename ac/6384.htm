<h3 align="center" class="ired">属天的奥秘 第6384节</h3>
<h4 align="center"></h4><p><strong>6384.</strong>“必住在海边的港口”表有从记忆知识推断出的真理在其中的生命。这从“港口”、“海”、和“住”的含义清楚可知：“港口”是指记忆知识所结束和开始的地方，在此是指从记忆知识推断出的真理所在的地方，因为“西布伦”在此论及那些信之真理居于这种知识的人；“海”是指作为一整体的记忆知识（<a href="28.htm">28</a>节）；“住”是指生命（<a href="1293.htm">1293</a>，<a href="3384.htm">3384</a>，<a href="3613.htm">3613</a>，<a href="4451.htm">4451</a>，<a href="6051.htm">6051</a>节）。由此明显可知，“必住在海边的港口”表示有从记忆知识推断出的真理在其中的生命。关于这种生命，可参看前面所述（<a href="6383.htm">6383</a>节）。要进一步知道，这种生命居于外在人或属世人，在某些处于属世层的最低级部分，也就是感官层的人中间；因为对他们来说，信之真理被牢牢绑到了记忆知识上，以致他们无法被提升。这也解释了为何比起属灵教会中的其他所有人，他们处于更大的模糊中。事实上，他们从理解力所获得的光极少，因为这理解力全神贯注于记忆知识和感官印象。那些持肯定态度，并运用记忆知识来强化信之真理的人就不同了；他们能从这些知识，也就是这些知识所在的属世层中被提升上来。这些人拥有一种被光照的理解力，并由此享有对属灵真理的某种觉知，而下面的记忆知识则用来服务于这种觉知。记忆知识如同一面镜子，使得信与仁之真理在其中被看见和认识，如同情感显现在脸上。</p>

Shall dwell at the haven of the seas. That this signifies life where there is conclusion of truth from memory-knowledges, is evident from the signification of "haven," as being the residence where memory-knowledges 
terminate and begin; here, the residence where there is conclusion of truth from memory-knowledges, for under the name of "Zebulun" those are here treated of with whom the truths of faith 
are in this residence; from the signification of "seas," as being memory-knowledges in the complex (n. 28); and from the signification of "dwelling," as being life (n. 1293, 3384, 3613, 4451, 6051). 
From this it is plain that by "dwelling at the haven of the seas" is signified life where there is conclusion of truth from memory-knowledges. (As regards this life see what has been said above, n. 
6383.) Be it known further that this life is in the external or natural man, and with some in the lowest natural, or in the sensuous, for they have the truths of faith so bound to memory-knowledges that 
they cannot be elevated. Hence also they are in obscurity more than all others in the spiritual church; for they have but little light from the intellectual, because this has been immersed in memory-knowledges 
and sensuous things. The case is different with those who have been in what is affirmative, and have fortified the truths of faith by means of memory-knowledges; but yet so that they can 
be elevated from these knowledges, that is, from the natural where these are. The intellectual of these men has been enlightened, and from this is in a certain perception of spiritual truth, to which 
the memory-knowledges that are beneath serve as a mirror wherein the truths of faith and of charity appear and are acknowledged, as affections are in the face. </p>

<p align="center"><b>Elliott(1983-1999) 6384</b></p><p><b>6384.</b>
'Will dwell at the haven of the seas' means a life in which truth inferred from known facts is present. This is clear from the meaning of 'the haven' as the place where factual knowledge ends and begins, 
in this case the place where truth inferred from factual knowledge is present, since 'Zebulun' here refers to those with whom the truths of faith reside in that knowledge; from the meaning of 'the 
seas' as known facts in their entirety, dealt with in <a href="28.htm">28</a>; and from the meaning of 'dwelling' as life, dealt with in <a href="1293.htm">1293</a>, <a href="3384.htm">3384</a>, <a href="3613.htm">3613</a>, <a href="4451.htm">4451</a>, <a href="6051.htm">6051</a>. From this it is evident that by 'will dwell at the haven 
of the seas' is meant a Life in which truth inferred from known facts is present. As regards that life, see what has been stated immediately above in <a href="6383.htm">6383</a>. But this also should be known about it, 
that that life resides in the external or natural man, with some people in the lowest part of the natural, which is the level of the senses; for with them the truths of faith have been tied to factual 
knowledge in such a way that they cannot be raised above it. This also explains why they are in greater obscurity than anyone else in the spiritual Church; for they receive little light from their understanding, 
since it is preoccupied with factual knowledge and sensory impressions. It is different with those who have had an affirmative attitude of mind and have used factual knowledge to corroborate 
the truths of faith, but in such a way that they can be raised above factual knowledge, that is, above the natural, where that knowledge resides. These people have an enlightened understanding and 
so enjoy some perception of spiritual truth, which is served by factual knowledge beneath. That knowledge acts as a mirror in which the truths of faith and charity are seen and recognized, even as affections 
are seen in the face. </p>

</p><b>6384.</b>
`Ad portum marium habitabit':  quod significet vitam ubi conclusio veri ex scientificis, constat a significatione `(x)portus' quod sit statio ubi scientifica terminantur et incohant, hic statio ubi 
conclusio veri ex scientificis, nam per `Zebulonem' hic agitur de illis {1}apud quos vera fidei ibi sunt'; ex significatione `marium' quod sint scientifica in complexu, de qua n. 28; et ex significatione 
`habitare' quod sit vita, de qua n. 1293, 3384, 3613, 4451, 6051; inde patet quod per `ad portum marium habitabit' significetur vita ubi conclusio veri ex scientificis. Quod vitam illam attinet, videantur 
quae mox supra n. 6383 dicta sunt, de qua vita porro sciendum quod ea sit in externo seu naturali homine, et apud quosdam in infimo naturali seu in sensuali, nam vera fidei {2} alligata scientificis 
{3}habent ita ut elevari nequeant; inde quoque prae reliquis in Ecclesia spirituali in obscuro sunt; ex intellectuali enim parum lucis habent, nam id immersum est scientificis et sensualibus; 
aliter se habet apud illos qui in affirmativo fuerunt, et vera fidei per scientifica firmarunt, sed tamen ita ut a scientificis, hoc est, a naturali ubi scientifica, {4} elevari possint; {5}horum intellectuale 
illustratum est, et sic in quadam perceptione veri spiritualis, cui serviunt scientifica quae infra sunt, sicut pro speculo in quo, sicut affectiones in facie, vera quae fidei et charitatis 
apparent et {6}agnoscuntur. @1 qui vera fidei in scientificis habent$ @2 i eorum$ @3 sunt$ @4 i versus interiora ubi vera in sua luce sunt,$ @5 illorum$ @6 cognoscuntur$ </p>
