<h3 align="center" class="ired">属天的奥秘 第762节</h3>
<h4 align="center"></h4><p><strong>762.</strong>然而，如今，属灵的试探几乎不为人知，它们也不象过去那样得以发生，因为人没有被信之真理所掌管。倘若真的发生属灵的试探，他必会屈服。取而代之的是诸如由属世和身体因素产生的不幸、忧伤和焦虑等其它经历。还有一些身体疾病，它们在某种程度上削弱和破碎了其乐趣和欲望的生命，将其思维固定并提升到更内在和更高尚的事物上。不过，这些并非属灵的试探，它们只存在于那些从主接受对真理和良善的一种良知之人当中。良知本身就是进行试探的层面。</p>

<p><strong>[NCE]762.</strong> Spiritual struggles are little known today and are not permitted to the extent that they once were, since people are not under the guidance of religious truth and would consequently succumb. Instead there occur other experiences, such as misfortunes, sorrows, and anxieties rising from earthly and bodily causes; and there is physical illness and disease. To some extent these experiences still subdue and shatter our life of pleasure and desire, and they direct and raise our thoughts to profound and godly themes. But they are not spiritual tests. Spiritual tests cannot take place except with those who receive from the Lord a conscience concerning what is true and good. Conscience itself is the field in which those trials do their work. </p>
<p align="center"><b>Potts(1905-1910) 762</b></p><p><b>762.</b>
But spiritual temptations are little known at this day. Nor are they permitted to such a degree as formerly, because man is not in the truth of faith, and would therefore succumb. In place of these temptations 
there are others, such as misfortunes, griefs, and anxieties, arising from natural and bodily causes, and also sicknesses and diseases of the body, which in a measure subdue and break up the 
life of a man's pleasures and cupidities, and determine and uplift his thoughts to interior and religious subjects. But these are not spiritual temptations, which are experienced by those only who have 
received from the Lord a conscience of truth and good. Conscience is itself the plane of temptations, wherein they operate. </p>

<p align="center"><b>Elliott(1983-1999) 762</b></p><p><b>762.</b>
Spiritual temptations however are scarcely known nowadays, nor are they allowed to take place as they did in the past, because man is not governed by the truth of faith. If they did take place he would 
go under. Instead of temptations he undergoes other experiences, such as misfortune, grief, and anxiety which arise from natural or from bodily causes. There are also bodily illnesses and diseases, 
which to some extent weaken and break down the life of his pleasures and desires, and fix his thoughts on and raise them to higher and nobler things. But these are not spiritual temptations, which do 
not exist except among people who have received from the Lord a conscience for truth and good. Conscience itself is the level on which temptations take place. </p>

<p align="center"><b>Latin(1748-1756) 762</b>
</p><b>762.</b>
Sed tentationes spirituales parum hodie notae sunt, nec permittuntur ita ut olim, quia homo non in veritate fidei est, sic etenim succumberet; loco illarum sunt alia, ut infortunia, tristitiae et anxietates, 
quae a causis naturalibus et corporeis existunt, sicut etiam aegritudines corporis et morbi, quae usque vitam ejus voluptatum et cupiditatum aliquantum domant et frangunt, et cogitationes ad 
interiora et pia determinant et elevant; sed non sunt tentationes spirituales, quae non dantur nisi apud eos qui conscientiam veri et boni a Domino acceperunt; ipsa conscientia est planum illarum, in 
quod operantur. </p>
