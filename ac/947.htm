<h4 align="center"></h4><p><h4 align="center">九、创世记第九章</h4><br />地狱（续）——与上述地狱明显不同的其它地狱<br /><br /><strong>947.</strong>有些人惯于欺骗，以为利用欺骗手段能得到一切，并且在肉身生活时因着欺骗得逞而确信这种观念。他们似乎住在左边的一种大酒桶或大瓮中。这个酒桶或大瓮被称为“地狱的发酵桶”（hellish tun），上面有一个盖子，外面有一个带有金字塔形底座的小球，他们视这个小球为他们所监督和统治下的整个宇宙。这一切在他们看来当真如此。其中那些欺哄无辜者的人在这个地方很多年了，我被告知，有些人已在此呆了二百多年。当被释放出来时，他们就拥有这样的幻觉：他们以为整个宇宙就是他们行于其上、脚下所踩的一个球，认为他们就是宇宙之神。我常见到他们，并与其谈论他们的这种幻想。但是，由于他们在世时就已具有这种本性，以至于无法从中解脱出来。我还多次发觉他们如何利用狡猾的欺骗手段败坏人的想法，并在顷刻之间将其注意力转到别的地方，用其它念头取代它们，以致人几乎意识不到他们正在做这种事。其行为如此自然，令人难以置信。这就是他们的本性。他们从不被准许进入人里面，因为他们会以极其秘密隐蔽，以至于不被发觉的方式注入他们的毒药。</p>

They see themselves as living in a kind of vat called Hell's Cask, off to the left.{*2} The vat has a lid, and outside it on a pyramid-shaped stand is a globe that they believe to be the universe, which they watch and control, or so it seems to them.<br />The ones who preyed on the innocent stay there for centuries. I was told that some have remained there for twenty centuries now.<br />When they are released, their hallucinations cause them to imagine that the universe is a globe, which they walk around and trample underfoot, believing themselves gods of the universe.<br />I have seen them several times and talked with them about their fantasy, but since they thought the same way in the world, they cannot be weaned from it.<br />I have also perceived on occasion how subtly, how craftily they can twist another's thinking, instantly redirect that person's thoughts, and substitute other ideas. They are so sly about it that it was hard to tell they were the ones doing it — and the way they do it is quite incredible. As this is their nature, they are barred from all contact with people on earth, for they inject quantities of venom so secretly and stealthily that no one can tell they have done it.<br /><br /><strong>Footnotes:</strong><br />{*1} For the hells already mentioned, see <a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_947/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_692" target=_top>692-700</a>, <a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_947/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_814" target=_top>814-831</a>, <a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_947/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_938" target=_top>938-946</a>.

He often describes position in the other world in relation to the body, though it is not always clear whether the body is Swedenborg's own body in that world or the body of the "universal human." This macroscopic form of human is described at length at the ends of the chapters in Secrets of Heaven in which he explains the meaning of <a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_947/bible_king-james-version_genesis_27_1-46" target=_top>Genesis 27</a>-<a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_947/bible_king-james-version_genesis_43_1-34" target=_top>43</a>; for a listing of the relevant sections, see note 2 in <a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_947/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_1276" target=_top>1276</a>.

CHAPTER 9  CONTINUATION CONCERNING THE HELLS HERE, CONCERNING OTHER HELLS, DISTINCT FROM THOSE PREVIOUSLY DESCRIBED Those who are deceitful and who suppose that they can obtain all things by deceitful 
craft, and who have confirmed themselves in this idea by their success in the life of the body, seem to themselves to dwell in a kind of tun or vat at the left, which is called the Infernal Tun, 
over which there is a covering, and outside of it a small globe on a pyramidal base, which they conceive to be the universe, under their inspection and rule. Precisely thus does it appear to them. Those 
of them who have deceitfully persecuted the innocent are there for ages. I was told that some have remained there already for twenty ages.* When they are let out they are possessed with such phantasy 
that they suppose the universe to be a globe about which they walk and which they trample with their feet, believing themselves to be gods of the universe. I have seen them at times and spoken with 
them about their phantasy; but as they had been of this nature in the world, they could not be withdrawn from it. I have also at times perceived with what subtle deceit they could pervert the thoughts, 
turning them in a moment in other directions, and substituting others, so that it could hardly be known that it was done by them, and this so naturally as to be beyond belief. Being of this character, 
these spirits are never admitted to men, for they infuse their poison so clandestinely and secretly as not to be noticeable. * An age (saeculum) in the Word is ten years. (See n. 433.) [REVISER] </p>

<p>THE HELLS - continued </p>
<p>In this section other hells that are different from those mentioned already. </p>
<p>People who are given to deceit, who imagine that they can get everything by the use of deceitful 
practices, and who during their lifetime have confirmed themselves in this notion from the fact that they have been successful in these matters, seem to themselves to be living on the left in 
a kind of tun, called 'the hellish tun', with a covering over it, and a small globe standing on a pyramid-shaped base outside of it, which they imagine to be the whole universe under their supervision 
and control. This is exactly how it appears to them. Those of them who have persecuted innocent people by the use of deceit are in that place for ages, and I have been told that some have already been 
there for twenty ages (saecula).<A name="fntext1"></a><A href="#fn1"><sup>a</sup></a> When they are let out they have this kind of delusion in which they imagine that the whole universe is a globe which they walk around and tread under their feet, believing 
that they are the gods of the universe. I have seen them frequently and have talked to them about this delusion of theirs. but because they had been of such a nature in the world they could not 
be wrested from it. I have also noticed several times how they could corrupt people's thoughts by cunning deception, and instantly divert their attention elsewhere and replace them with other ideas, 
doing so in such a way that one scarcely realized they were doing it. And they acted in an unbelievably natural way. Such being their nature, they are never allowed near men, for they inject their poison 
in so secret and hidden a fashion as to escape notice.

GENESEOS                         CAPUT NONUM                   Continuatio de Infernis    Hic de aliis Infernis, quae a prioribus distincta sunt </p>
<p>Qui dolosi sunt, et omnia per 
dolosas machinationes se obtinere posse putant, et se confirmarunt in vita corporis ex eo quod talia successerint iis, ii habitare sibi videntur in tonna quadam ad sinistrum quae vocatur 'tonna infernalis,' 
super quam tegumentum, et extra orbiculus super basin pyramidalem, quem putant esse universum quod spectent et gubernent; ita prorsus iis apparet: qui eorum innocentes dolose persecuti sunt, 
ibi sunt per saecula; alibi dictum quod quidam ibi jam per viginti saecula {1} manserint: cum emittuntur, talem phantasiam habent quod putent universum esse orbem quendam, quem circum ambulant et pedibus 
calcant, se deos universi credentes: aliquoties mihi visi, et cum iis de phantasia eorum locutus, sed quia tales fuerunt in mundo, non potuerunt abduci. Percepi etiam aliquoties quam subtili dolo 
pervertere possent cogitationes, et flectere momento aliorum, et substituere alia, sic ut vix potuisset cognosci quod ab iis; et hoc tali natura ut incredibile sit; qui quia tales, nusquam admittuntur 
ad homines, nam venena ita clandestine et latenter infundunt, ut non appercipi possit. 	@1 Saeculum= 10 anni (see n. 433).$ </p>
