<h3 align="center" class="ired">属天的奥秘 第2466节</h3>
<h4 align="center"></h4><p><strong>2466.</strong> 就内义而言，所表示的是上述事物，这是得以证实的，事实上，每句话都能得到证实。不过，它们绝大部分在前面已被证实，而且，它们都是些诸如使人震惊、刺耳的事。从上述概括性的解读可以看出，所说的这些事描述了圣言中“摩押”和“亚扪人”所表示的这种宗教信仰的起源，其性质等到论述摩押和亚扪人时再予以阐明。显然，所表示的是被玷污的良善和被歪曲的真理。在圣言中，对良善的玷污和对真理的歪曲常常被描述为“淫乱”和“淫行”，也如此被称呼。这是因为，良善与真理彼此形成一种婚姻（<a href="1904.htm">1904</a>，<a href="2173.htm">2173</a>节）。事实上，令绝大多数人难以置信的是，世上婚姻的圣洁，以及圣言中所制定的婚姻律法就源于良善与真理的这种婚姻，如同源于自己的源头。<br />这个问题的真相是这样：当属天和属灵之物从天上降至低界（lower sphere）时，它们在那里以最完美的方式被转化为某种婚姻的形像。这是因为，属灵之物与属世之物之间存在对应关系。关于这种对应关系，蒙主怜悯，我将在别处予以描述。但是，当它们在低界被败坏时，如那里有恶魔和恶灵在场时所发生的情形，它们就被转化为诸如属于淫乱和淫行之类的事物。这就是为何在圣言中，对良善的玷污和对真理的歪曲被描述为奸淫和行淫，也如此被称呼。这从以下经文很明显地看出来，以西结书：<br />你因你的名声就行邪淫，与所有过路的人纵情淫乱。你用衣服为自己在高处结彩，在其上行邪淫。你又将我所给你的、我那些华美金器银器，为自己制造男性的像，与它们行淫。你把给我所生的儿女取来祭献给他们。你行淫乱岂是小事？你也和你邻邦放纵情欲的埃及人行淫，加增你的淫乱，惹我发怒。你又与亚述人行淫，与他们行淫之后，仍不满足；并且加增淫乱直到那贸易之地，就是迦勒底，你仍不满足。（以西结书<a href="http://39-27.cn/结16.15.htm">16:15</a>-<a href="http://39-27.cn/结16.17.htm">17</a>，<a href="http://39-27.cn/结16.20.htm">20</a>，<a href="http://39-27.cn/结16.21.htm">21</a>，<a href="http://39-27.cn/结16.26.htm">26</a>，<a href="http://39-27.cn/结16.28.htm">28</a>-<a href="http://39-27.cn/结16.29.htm">29</a>等）<br />这论述的是耶路撒冷，它在此表示歪曲真理的教会。谁都能看出，所有这些事具有截然不同的含义。<br />显而易见，对教会的某种事物的歪曲就被称为“行淫”。此处所提到的“衣服”表正被歪曲的真理。随之而来的所敬拜的虚假就是在其上行邪淫的结彩的“高处”所表示的。“衣服”表真理（参看<a href="1073.htm">1073</a>节）；“高处”表敬拜（<a href="796.htm">796</a>节）。“我所给你的华美金器银器”表取自圣言的对善与真的认知，他们用来证实虚假。当这些虚假看似真理时，它们就被称为与其行淫的“男性的像”。“华美金器银器”表对善与真的认知，这从“金”、“银”的含义明显可知：“金”是指良善（<a href="113.htm">113</a>，<a href="1551.htm">1551</a>，<a href="1552.htm">1552</a>节）；“银”是指真理（<a href="1551.htm">1551</a>，<a href="2048.htm">2048</a>节）。“男性的像”表它们看似真理（参看<a href="2046.htm">2046</a>节）。他们所生并祭献给它们的“儿女”表他们已歪曲的真理与良善，这从“儿女”的含义明显可知（参看<a href="489.htm">489</a>-<a href="491.htm">491</a>，<a href="533.htm">533</a>，<a href="2362.htm">2362</a>节）。“与埃及人行淫”表通过记忆知识败坏这些真理与良善，这从“埃及”的含义明显可知，“埃及”是指记忆知识（<a href="1164.htm">1164</a>，<a href="1165.htm">1165</a>，<a href="1186.htm">1186</a>，<a href="1462.htm">1462</a>节）。“与亚述人行淫”表通过推理败坏它们，这从“亚述”的含义明显可知，“亚述”是指推理（<a href="119.htm">119</a>，<a href="1186.htm">1186</a>节）。“加增淫乱直到迦勒底地”表败坏它们，甚至到对真理的亵渎，也就是“迦勒底”（<a href="1368.htm">1368</a>节）。所有这一切清楚表明，字义中的圣言内义是何性质。<br />类似经文在别处出现，以西结书：<br />有两个女人，同是一母的女儿，她们在埃及行邪淫；在幼年时行邪淫；撒马利亚就是阿荷拉，耶路撒冷就是阿荷利巴。阿荷拉归我之后行邪淫，贪恋所爱的人，就是她的邻邦亚述人。阿荷拉选中所有亚述人，与他们放纵淫行；自从在埃及的时候，她就没有离弃淫乱，因为她年幼时，埃及人与她同寝。阿荷利巴比她更放纵情欲，她的淫乱比她姐姐的淫乱更甚；她贪恋亚述人；加增她的淫行，看见迦勒底人的像，她一眼看见就贪恋他们；巴比伦人就来登她爱情的床。（以西结书<a href="http://39-27.cn/结23.2.htm">23:2</a>-<a href="http://39-27.cn/结23.5.htm">5</a>，<a href="http://39-27.cn/结23.7.htm">7</a>-<a href="http://39-27.cn/结23.8.htm">8</a>，<a href="http://39-27.cn/结23.11.htm">11</a>-<a href="http://39-27.cn/结23.12.htm">12</a>，<a href="http://39-27.cn/结23.14.htm">14</a>，<a href="http://39-27.cn/结23.16.htm">16</a>等）<br />“撒马利亚”表具有对真理的情感的教会，“耶路撒冷”表具有对良善的情感的教会。她们与埃及人、亚述人“行邪淫”表通过记忆知识和推理玷污良善与真理，用以证实虚假。这从“埃及”的含义（<a href="1164.htm">1164</a>，<a href="1165.htm">1165</a>，<a href="1186.htm">1186</a>，<a href="1462.htm">1462</a>节）和“亚述”（<a href="119.htm">119</a>，<a href="1186.htm">1186</a>节）的含义明显可知。这些玷污行为甚至到了亵渎敬拜的地步，就真理而言，这种被亵渎的敬拜就是“迦勒底”（<a href="1368.htm">1368</a>节）；就良善而言，这种被亵渎的敬拜就是“巴别人”（<a href="1182.htm">1182</a>，<a href="1326.htm">1326</a>节）。<br />以赛亚书：<br />七十年终了以后，耶和华必造访推罗，她必回到她妓女行业，与地上的万国行淫。（以赛亚书<a href="http://39-27.cn/赛23.17.htm">23:17</a>）<br />“妓女行业”和推罗“行淫”就表示对虚假的夸耀。“推罗”表对真理的认知（参看<a href="1201.htm">1201</a>节）；“万国”表真理（<a href="1672.htm">1672</a>节），淫行就是与它们发生的。<br />耶利米书：<br />你和许多情人行淫，还可以回转归向我。你向山丘举目观看，你在何处没有淫行呢？你坐在道旁等候他们，好像阿拉伯人在旷野埋伏一样，并且你以你的淫行邪恶玷污了全地。（耶利米书<a href="http://39-27.cn/耶3.1.htm">3:1</a>-<a href="http://39-27.cn/耶3.2.htm">2</a>）<br />“行淫”和“以淫行玷污全地”表败坏和歪曲教会的真理。“地”表教会（参看<a href="662.htm">662</a>，<a href="1066.htm">1066</a>，<a href="1067.htm">1067</a>节）。<br /><br />她以其淫声玷污这地，和石头木头行淫。（耶利米书<a href="http://39-27.cn/耶3.9.htm">3:9</a>）<br />“和石头木头行淫”表败坏属外在敬拜的真理与良善，“石头”表这类真理（参看<a href="643.htm">643</a>，<a href="1298.htm">1298</a>节），“木头”表这类良善（<a href="643.htm">643</a>节）。<br /><br />因为他们在以色列中行了丑事，与同伴的妻子行淫，又冒我的名说虚假话，是我未曾吩咐他们说的。（耶利米书<a href="http://39-27.cn/耶29.23.htm">29:23</a>）<br />“与同伴的妻子行淫”是指教导如同来自他们的虚假。（to teach falsity as from them）<br /><br />我在耶路撒冷的先知中曾见可憎恶的事，他们行奸淫，行虚假事。（耶利米书<a href="http://39-27.cn/耶23.14.htm">23:14</a>）<br />此处“行奸淫”与被玷污的良善有关，“行虚假事”与被歪曲的真理有关。<br />你那些可憎恶之事，就是在田野的山上行奸淫，发嘶声，作淫乱的事，我都看见了。耶路撒冷啊，你有祸了！你不肯洁净，还要到几时呢？（耶利米书<a href="http://39-27.cn/耶13.27.htm">13:27</a>）<br />何西阿书：<br />奸淫和酒，并新酒，夺去人的心。我的民求问木偶，其木杖能指示它；因为淫乱的灵使他们失迷，他们就行淫离弃神，不守约束；他们在各山顶献祭，在各高冈上，在橡树、杨树、栗树之下烧香；所以，你们的女儿淫乱，你们的媳妇行淫；我岂不惩罚你们的女儿？因为她们淫乱，我岂不惩罚你们的媳妇？因为她们行淫。他们离群与娼妓同居，与妓女一同献祭。（何西阿书<a href="http://39-27.cn/何4.11.htm">4:11</a>-<a href="http://39-27.cn/何4.14.htm">14</a>）<br />从下面的解释可以看出这些事物的内义各自表示什么：“酒”是指虚假；“新酒”是指源于此的邪恶；“求问木偶”是指属于某种恶欲之乐的良善；“行指示的木杖”是指其理解力的幻想力；“山”和“高冈”是指我欲和物欲（或对自我的爱和对这个世界的爱）；“橡树、杨树、栗树”是指他们所信靠的如此众多的愚钝直觉；“女儿”和“媳妇”是指这类情感；所有这一切说明此处“行淫”、“淫乱”和“妓女”分别表示什么。<br />同一先知书：<br />以色列啊！你行邪淫离弃你的神，在各谷场上如妓女喜爱淫资。（何西阿书<a href="http://39-27.cn/何9.1.htm">9:1</a>）<br />“如妓女喜爱淫资”表对虚假的夸耀。摩西书：<br />只怕你与那地的居民立约，他们随从他们的神，就行邪淫，祭祀他们的神，有人叫你，你便吃他的祭物；又为你的儿子娶他们的女儿为妻，他们的女儿随从他们的神，就行邪淫，使你的儿子也随从他们的　神行邪淫。（出埃及记<a href="http://39-27.cn/出34.15.htm">34:15</a>-<a href="http://39-27.cn/出34.16.htm">16</a>）<br />摩西书：<br />我要把一切随从他行邪淫，就是随从摩洛行邪淫的人都从他们的民中剪除；这灵魂若转向招魂的和行巫术的，随从他们行淫，我就要向那灵魂变脸，把他从他的民中剪除。（利未记<a href="http://39-27.cn/利20.5.htm">20:5</a>-<a href="http://39-27.cn/利20.6.htm">6</a>）<br />摩西书：<br />你们的子孙必在旷野游牧四十年，担当你们的淫行，直到你们的尸首在旷野消灭。（民数记<a href="http://39-27.cn/民14.33.htm">14:33</a>）<br />摩西书：<br />就记得耶和华的一切命令，并且遵行，不随从自己的心意、眼目行邪淫。（民数记<a href="http://39-27.cn/民15.39.htm">15:39</a>）<br />在启示录中说得更清楚：<br />有一位天使说，来，我要把那坐在众水之上的大淫妇所要受的审判指示你。地上的君王与她行淫，地上的居民喝醉了她淫乱的酒。（启示录<a href="http://39-27.cn/启17.1.htm">17:1</a>-<a href="http://39-27.cn/启17.2.htm">2</a>）<br />“大淫妇”表那些处于亵渎的敬拜之人。她坐于其上的“众水”表认知（<a href="28.htm">28</a>，<a href="739.htm">739</a>节）。与她行淫的“地上的君王”是指教会的真理（<a href="1672.htm">1672</a>，<a href="2015.htm">2015</a>，<a href="2069.htm">2069</a>节）。他们所喝醉的“酒”是指虚假（<a href="1071.htm">1071</a>，<a href="1072.htm">1072</a>节）。由于“酒”与“喝醉”表示这些事，故经上论到罗得的女儿说，她们叫她们的父亲喝酒（19:32-33，35）。<br /><br />巴比伦给列族喝她邪淫大怒的酒；地上的君王与她行淫。（启示录<a href="http://39-27.cn/启18.3.htm">18:3</a>）<br />“巴比伦”或“巴别”表外在显得圣洁，而内在不洁的敬拜（<a href="1182.htm">1182</a>，<a href="1295.htm">1295</a>，<a href="1326.htm">1326</a>节）。喝她酒的“列族”表正在被亵渎的良善（<a href="1259.htm">1259</a>，<a href="1260.htm">1260</a>，<a href="1416.htm">1416</a>，<a href="1849.htm">1849</a>节）；与她行淫的“君王”表真理（<a href="1672.htm">1672</a>，<a href="2015.htm">2015</a>，<a href="2069.htm">2069</a>节）。<br />主神的审判是真实公义的。因祂审判了那用淫行使地上败坏的大淫妇。（启示录<a href="http://39-27.cn/启19.2.htm">19:2</a>）<br />“地”表教会（<a href="566.htm">566</a>，<a href="662.htm">662</a>，<a href="1066.htm">1066</a>，<a href="1068.htm">1068</a>，<a href="2117.htm">2117</a>，<a href="2118.htm">2118</a>）。<br />由于“行淫”表这类事，“女儿”表情感，故祭司的女儿严禁行淫，对此，我们在摩西书中读到：<br />祭司的女儿若开始行淫，就辱没了她的父亲，必用火将她焚烧。（利未记<a href="http://39-27.cn/利21.9.htm">21:9</a>）<br />还命令他们不可将娼妓所得的钱带入耶和华的殿，因为这是可憎的事（申命记<a href="http://39-27.cn/申23.18.htm">23:18</a>）。由于同样的原因，若丈夫怀疑妻子通奸，对这妻子就有这样一个审问程序（民数记<a href="http://39-27.cn/民5.12.htm">5:12</a>-<a href="http://39-27.cn/民5.31.htm">31</a>）；该程序的每一个细节都与对良善的玷污有关。此外，圣言中所提到的奸淫和行淫的属有很多，种类更多。稍后所解释的这一种在此被描述为罗得的女儿与她们的父亲同寝，就是所谓的“摩押”和“亚扪人”。</p>

<p align="center"><b>Potts(1905-1910) 2466</b></p><p><b>2466.</b>
That the things now set forth are signified in the internal sense, can be confirmed, and indeed as to each word; but most of them have been confirmed before, and besides, they are such as do violence 
to our ideas and give offense to chaste ears. From the summary explication we can see that by the things in question there is described the origin of such a religion as is signified in the Word by "Moab" 
and the "son of Ammon." The nature of this religion will be told hereafter, where Moab and the son of Ammon are treated of. That it is adulterated good and falsified truth, is evident. The adulterations 
of good and the falsifications of truth are commonly described in the Word by "adulteries" and "whoredoms," and are also so called, the reason of which is based on the fact that good and truth 
form a marriage with each other (n. 1904, 2173); nay, incredible as it may appear to most, it is from this marriage as from its genuine origin that there comes the sanctity of marriages on earth, and 
also the laws of marriages given in the Word. [2] For the case is this: When celestial and spiritual things descend out of heaven into a lower sphere, they are there turned in the most perfect manner 
into some likeness of marriages, and this from the correspondence that exists between spiritual and natural things (concerning which correspondence of the Lord's Divine mercy elsewhere). But when they 
are perverted in the lower sphere, as is done where evil genii and evil spirits are present, the same are then turned into such things as belong to adulteries and whoredoms. Hence it is that contaminations 
of good and perversions of truth are described in the Word by adulteries and whoredoms, and are also so named, as is very evident from the following passages in Ezekiel: </p>
<p>     Thou didst commit 
whoredom because of thy name, and pouredst out thy whoredoms on everyone that passed by; thou didst take of thy garments and madest for thee high places decked with diverse colors, and didst commit 
whoredom upon them; thou didst take the vessels of thy adornment of My gold and of My silver, which I had given thee, and madest for thee images of a male, and didst commit whoredom with them; thou hast 
taken thy sons and thy daughters, whom thou hast borne unto Me, and these hast thou sacrificed unto them. Was there but little of thy whoredoms? Thou hast committed whoredom with the sons of Egypt, 
thy neighbors, great of flesh and hast multiplied thy whoredom to provoke Me to anger; thou hast committed whoredom with the sons of Asshur, and hast committed whoredom with them, and wast not satisfied; 
and thou hast multiplied thy whoredom even unto the land of traffic, unto Chaldea; and yet thou wast not satisfied therewith (Ezek. 16:15-17, 20, 26, 28-29, etc.), [3] where Jerusalem is treated 
of, by which is here signified the church perverted in respect to truths. Everyone can see that all these things have quite different meanings. That something of the church that has been perverted is 
called "whoredom" is quite evident; the "garments" here mentioned denote the truths that are being perverted; the falsities thence derived, which are worshiped, are the "high places decked with divers 
colors," with which there was whoredom. (That "garments" denote truths may be seen above, n. 1073; and that "high places" denote worship, n. 796.)  The "vessels of adornment of gold and silver which 
I had given," denote the knowledges of good and truth from the Word by which they confirm falsities; and when these appear as truths, they are called "images of a male" with which whoredom was committed. 
(That the "vessels of adornment of gold and silver," denote the knowledges of good and truth, is evident from the signification of "gold," as being good, n. 113, 1551, 1552; and of "silver" as 
being truth, n. 1551, 2048; and that the "images of a male" signify that they appear as truths may be seen above, n. 2046.) That the "sons and daughters" which they bore and sacrificed to them denote 
the truths and goods which they have perverted, is evident from the signification of "sons and daughters" (see n. 489-491, 533, 2362). That to "commit whoredom with the sons of Egypt," denotes to pervert 
these truths and goods by means of memory-knowledges is evident from the signification of "Egypt" as being memory-knowledge (n. 1164, 1165, 1186, 1462). That to "commit whoredom with the sons of Asshur," 
denotes to pervert them by reasonings, is evident from the signification of "Asshur," as being reasoning (n. 119, 1186). That to "multiply whoredom even unto the land of Chaldea," denotes to pervert 
them even to the profanation of truth, which is "Chaldea" (n. 1368). All this makes clear what is the nature of the internal sense of the Word in the very sense of the letter. [4] In like manner 
elsewhere in the same Prophet: </p>
<p>     Two women, the daughters of one mother, committed whoredom in Egypt; they committed whoredom in their youth; Samaria is Oholah, Jerusalem is Oholibah. Oholah committed 
whoredom under Me, and she doted on her lovers, the Assyrians her neighbors, she bestowed her whoredoms upon them, the choice of all the sons of Asshur; she hath not forsaken her whoredoms from 
Egypt, for they lay with her in her youth. Oholibah corrupted her love more than she, and her whoredoms more than the whoredoms of her sister; she doted upon the sons of Asshur; she added to her whoredoms, 
and saw the images of the Chaldeans, she doted upon them at the view of her eyes; the sons of Babel came to her into the bed of loves (Ezek. 23:2-5, 7-8, 11-12, 14, 16, etc.). "Samaria" denotes 
the church which is in the affection of truth, and "Jerusalem" that which is in the affection of good; whose "whoredoms with the Egyptians," and "with the sons of Asshur," denote perversions of good 
and truth by means of memory-knowledges and reasonings, by which falsities are confirmed, as is evident from the signification of "Egypt" (n. 1164, 1165, 1186, 1462); and of "Asshur" (n. 119, 1186). 
That this was done even to profane worship, which in respect to truth is "Chaldea" (n. 1368); and in respect to good is the "sons of Babel" (n. 1182, 1326). [5] In Isaiah: </p>
<p>     And it shall come to 
pass at the end of seventy years that Jehovah will visit Tyre, and she shall return to her harlot hire, and shall commit whoredom with all the kingdoms of the earth (Isa. 23:17). It is the vaunting 
of what is false that is signified by the "harlot hire" and the "whoredom" of Tyre. That "Tyre" denotes the knowledges of truth may be seen above (n. 1201); and also that the "kingdoms" with which the 
whoredom was committed denote truths (n. 1672). [6] In Jeremiah: </p>
<p>     Thou hast committed whoredom with many companions; and return again unto Me. Lift up thine eyes unto the hills, and see; where 
hast thou not been debauched? Upon the ways hast thou sat for them as an Arab in the wilderness, and thou hast profaned the land with thy whoredoms and with thy wickedness (Jer. 3:1-2). To "commit whoredoms" 
and to "profane the land with whoredoms" denote to pervert and falsify the truths of the church (that the "land" denotes the church see above, n. 662, 1066, 1067). [7] Again: </p>
<p>     By the voice 
of her whoredom she hath profaned the land, she hath committed adultery with stone and with wood (Jer. 3:9); </p>
<p>to "commit adultery with stone and with wood," denotes to pervert the truths and goods 
of external worship (that "stone" is such truth may be seen above, n. 643, 1298; and that "wood" is such good, n. 643). [8] Again: </p>
<p>     Because they have wrought folly in Israel, and have committed 
adultery with the wives of their fellows, and have spoken a word in My name that is false, which I commanded them not (Jer. 29:23); </p>
<p>to "commit adultery with the wives of their fellows," is to teach 
falsity as from them. [9] Again: </p>
<p>     In the prophets of Jerusalem I have seen a horrible thing, in committing adultery and walking in falsehood (Jer. 23:14); </p>
<p>where to "commit adultery" regards good 
which is contaminated; and to "walk in falsehood" regards truth which is perverted. Again: </p>
<p>     I have seen thine abominations; thine adulteries, and thy neighings, the foulness of thy whoredom upon 
the hills in the field. Woe unto thee, O Jerusalem, thou wilt not be made clean; how long shall it yet be? (Jer. 13:27). [10] In Hosea: </p>
<p>     Whoredom, and wine, and new wine, have taken possession 
of the heart. My people inquireth of wood, and the staff thereof will declare it; for the spirit of whoredom hath led them astray, and they have committed whoredom from under their God; they sacrifice 
upon the tops of the mountains, and burn incense upon the hills, under the oak, the poplar, and the terebinth [robore]; therefore your daughters commit whoredom, and your daughters-in-law commit adultery; 
shall I not visit upon your daughters because they commit whoredom, and upon your daughters-in-law because they commit adultery? For they divide with whores, and sacrifice with prostitutes (Hos. 
4:11-14). What each of these things signifies in the internal sense can be seen from the signification of "wine," as being falsity; of "new wine," as being the evil thence derived; of the "wood that 
is inquired of," as being the good of the delight of some cupidity; of the "staff that will declare," as being the imaginary power of their understanding; also of the "mountains" and the "hills," as 
being the loves of self and of the world; of the "oak, the poplar, and the terebinth," as being so many gross perceptions thence derived in which they trust; of "daughters" and the "daughters-in-law" 
as being such affections; all of which show what is here signified by "whoredoms," "adulteries," and "harlots." [11] In the same: </p>
<p>     O Israel, thou hast committed whoredom over thy God, thou hast 
loved harlot hire upon all the corn floors (Hos. 9:1); </p>
<p>"harlot hire" denotes the vaunting of what is false. In Moses: </p>
<p>     Lest thou make a covenant with the inhabitants of the land, and they commit 
whoredom after their gods, and sacrifice unto their gods; and one call thee, and thou eat of his sacrifices, and thou take of his daughters for thy sons, and his daughters commit whoredom after their 
gods, and make thy sons commit whoredom after their gods (Exod. 34:15-16). In the same: </p>
<p>     I will cut off all that commit whoredom after him, committing whoredom after Molech, from the midst of 
their people; and the soul that turneth unto them that have familiar spirits, and unto the soothsayers, to commit whoredom after them, I will set My face against that soul, and will cut him off from the 
midst of his people (Lev. 20:5-6). In the same: </p>
<p>     Your sons shall be shepherds in the wilderness forty years, and shall bear your whoredoms, until your bodies be consumed in the wilderness (Num. 
14:33). In the same: </p>
<p>     Remember all the precepts of Jehovah, and do them, that ye seek not after your own heart, and your own eyes, after which ye do commit whoredom (Num. 15:39). [12] And still 
more plainly in John: </p>
<p>     An angel said, Come hither, I will show thee the judgment of the great harlot that sitteth upon many waters, with whom the kings of the earth have committed whoredom, and 
the inhabitants of the earth have been made drunk with the wine of her whoredom (Rev. 17:1-2); </p>
<p>the "great harlot" denotes those who are in profane worship; the "many waters" upon which she sits, are 
knowledges (n. 28, 739); the "kings of the earth" who have committed whoredom with her, are the truths of the church (n. 1672, 2015, 2069); the "wine" with which they were made drunk, is falsity (n. 
1071, 1072). Because "wine" and "drunkenness" signify these things, it is said of the daughters of Lot, that they made their father drink wine (verses 32-33, 35). [13] In the same: </p>
<p>     Babylon hath 
made all nations drink of the wine of the fury of her whoredom, and the kings of the earth have committed whoredom with her (Rev. 18:3). "Babylon" or "Babel" denotes a worship the externals of which 
appear holy, while the interiors are profane (n. 1182, 1295, 1326); the "nations that she makes to drink," are the goods which are being profaned (n. 1259, 1260, 1416, 1849); the "kings" who committed 
whoredom with her, are truths (n. 1672, 2015, 2069). In the same: </p>
<p>     True and just are the judgments of the Lord God, for He hath judged the great harlot, who corrupted the earth with her whoredom 
(Rev. 19:2); </p>
<p>where the "earth" denotes the church (n. 566, 662, 1066, 1068, 2117, 2118). [14] As "whoredoms" signify such things, and "daughters" signify affections, it was therefore forbidden so 
severely that the daughter of a priest should commit whoredom; concerning which we read in Moses: </p>
<p>     The daughter of a priest, having begun to commit whoredom, she is profaning her father, she shall 
be burned with fire (Lev. 21:9). It was also commanded that they should not bring the hire of a harlot into the house of Jehovah, because it is an abomination (Deut. 23:18). And for the same reason 
there was such an inquisitorial process concerning a wife whose husband had conceived a suspicion of adultery (Num. 5:12-31), in which instance each and all things have relation to the adulterations 
of good. Moreover in the Word many different kinds of adulteries and whoredoms are spoken of, and still more varieties. This kind which is here described by Lot's daughters lying with their father, 
is what is called "Moab" and the "son of Ammon," now to be explained. </p>

<p align="center"><b>Elliott(1983-1999) 2466</b></p><p><b>2466.</b>
It is certainly possible to confirm that in the internal sense such things are meant as have been set forth in the paragraph above, and indeed to confirm them as to each word. But apart from the fact 
that they have been confirmed already they are also such as shock people's minds and offend their ears. From the summary explanation given above it may become clear that those things are used to describe 
how such a religion originated as that meant in the Word by 'Moab' and 'the son of Ammon'. The nature of it will be stated later on where Moab and the son of Ammon are the subject. The fact that 
adulterated good and falsified truth are meant is clear. Adulterations of good and falsifications of truth are commonly described in the Word as acts of adultery and whoredom, and are actually called 
such. The reason for this is that good and truth belong together like a married couple, <a href="1904.htm">1904</a>, <a href="2173.htm">2173</a>. Indeed, though scarcely anyone may credit it, it is from this marriage of good and truth as its own 
true source that the holiness of marriages on earth is derived as well as the marriage laws laid down in the Word. </p>
<p></p>
<p><b>[2]</b>
 The truth of the matter is that when celestial things together with spiritual 
come down from heaven into a lower sphere they are in a most perfect way converted there into the likeness of marriages. They do so on account of the correspondence which exists between spiritual things 
and natural, a correspondence which in the Lord's Divine mercy will be described elsewhere. But when those same things are perverted in the lower sphere, as happens when evil genii and evil spirits 
are present there, they are in that case converted into the kind of things that go with acts of adultery and whoredom. This is why in the Word defilements of good and perversions of truth are described 
as acts of adultery and whoredom and are also called such, as becomes quite clear from the following places: In Ezekiel, </p>
<blockquote>
You committed whoredom because of your renown, and poured out your acts of 
whoredom on every passer-by. You took some of your garments and made for yourself high places variously coloured, and on them committed whoredom. For your adornment you took vessels made of My gold 
and of My silver, which I had given you, and made for yourself figures of the male, and committed whoredom with them. You took your sons and your daughters, whom you had borne to Me, and sacrificed them 
to them. Were your acts of whoredom a small matter? You committed whoredom with the sons of Egypt, your neighbours, great in flesh, and multiplied your whoredom to provoke Me to anger. You committed 
whoredom with the sons of Asshur, and you committed whoredom with them and were not satisfied. And you multiplied your whoredom, even as far as the trading land of Chaldea; and yet you were not satisfied 
with this. <a href="http://bible.gospelcom.net/cgi-bin/bible?passage=Ezek%2016:%2015-17,%2020,%2026,%2028,%2029&amp;version=ESV&amp;interface=print&amp;showfn=yes&amp;showxref">Ezek 16: 15-17, 20, 26, 28, 29</a>, and following verses. </p>
<p>This refers to Jerusalem, which means in this instance the Church perverted as regards truths. Anyone may see that all the things 
referred to here have entirely different meanings. </p>
<p></p>
<p><b>[3]</b>
 That the perversion of some aspect of the Church is called whoredom is quite evident. 'The garments' referred to are truths that are being 
perverted. Consequent falsities which are worshipped are meant by 'the variously coloured high places' on which whoredom took place - 'garments' meaning truths, see <a href="1073.htm">1073</a>, and 'high places' worship, <a href="796.htm">796</a>.

'The vessels for adornment made of the gold and the silver which I had given' are cognitions of good and truth drawn from the Word which they use to confirm falsities. And when such falsities are 
seen as truths they are called 'figures of the male with whom whoredom was committed'. For 'vessels for adornment made of gold and silver' means cognitions of good and truth, as is evident from the meaning 
of 'gold' as good, <a href="113.htm">113</a>, <a href="1551.htm">1551</a>, <a href="1552.htm">1552</a>, and of 'silver' as truth, <a href="1551.htm">1551</a>, <a href="2048.htm">2048</a>; 'figures of the mare' means falsities which are seen as truths, <a href="2046.htm">2046</a>. 'The sons and daughters whom they had borne and sacrificed 
to them' means the goods and truths which they perverted, as is evident from the meaning of 'sons and daughters', <a href="489.htm">489</a>-<a href="491.htm">491</a>, <a href="533.htm">533</a>, <a href="2362.htm">2362</a>; 'committing whoredom with the sons of Egypt' means perverting 
those goods and truths by means of facts, as is evident from the meaning of 'Egypt' as factual knowledge, <a href="1164.htm">1164</a>, <a href="1165.htm">1165</a>, <a href="1186.htm">1186</a>, <a href="1462.htm">1462</a>. 'Committing whoredom with the sons of Asshur' means perverting by 
means of reasonings, as is evident from the meaning of 'Asshur' as reasoning, <a href="119.htm">119</a>, <a href="1186.htm">1186</a>; 'multiplying whoredom even as far as the land of Chaldea' means even to the profanation of truth, which is Chaldea,

 A similar passage occurs elsewhere in the same prophet, </p>
<blockquote>
Two women, the daughters 
of one mother, committed whoredom in Egypt. In their youth they committed whoredom. Oholah is Samaria, Oholibah is Jerusalem. Oholah committed whoredom under Me and doted on her lovers, on the Assyrians 
her neighbours. She bestowed her acts of whoredom on them, the choicest of all the sons of Asshur Her acts of whoredom brought from Egypt she did not give up, for they had lain with her in her youth. 
Oholibah corrupted her love more than she, and her acts of whoredom more than her sister's acts of whoredom; she doted on the sons of Asshur. She added to her acts of whoredom and saw the images 
of the Chaldeans. As soon as her eyes saw them she desired them. The sons of Babel came to her, into her love-bed. <a href="http://bible.gospelcom.net/cgi-bin/bible?passage=Ezek%2023:%202-5,%207,%208,%2011,%2012,%2014,%2016,%2017&amp;version=ESV&amp;interface=print&amp;showfn=yes&amp;showxref">Ezek 23: 2-5, 7, 8, 11, 12, 14, 16, 17</a>.

<p>'Samaria' is a Church with the affection 
for truth, 'Jerusalem' a Church with the affection for good. By 'the acts of whoredom' committed by such affections with 'the Egyptians' and with 'the sons of Asshur' are meant the perversions of good 
and truth by means of facts and reasonings used to confirm falsities, as is evident from the meaning of 'Egypt', <a href="1164.htm">1164</a>, <a href="1165.htm">1165</a>, <a href="1186.htm">1186</a>, <a href="1462.htm">1462</a>, and of 'Asshur', <a href="119.htm">119</a>, <a href="1186.htm">1186</a>.

<p>What each of these things means in the internal sense becomes clear

staff which makes a declaration' as the imaginary power of their own understanding, also of 'mountains and hills' as self-love and love of the world, of 'oak, poplar, and terebinth' as so many dull-witted

ac ita quoque vocantur; causa inde est quod bonum et verum inter conjugium forment, n. 1904, (x)2173; {1} immo quod vix aliquis crede potest, inde, ut a suo genuino principio, est sanctitas conjugiorum 
terra, etiam sunt leges conjugiorum de quibus in Verbo: [2] nam ita habet; caelestia cum spiritualibus, cum e caelo {2} descendunt in sphaera inferiorem, prorsus ibi vertuntur in simile conjugiorum, 
et hoc ex correspondentia quae est inter spiritualia et naturalia, de qua correspondentia, ex Divina Domini Misericordia, alibi; cum autem illa pervertuntur in sphaera inferiore, ut fit ubi mali 
genii et mali spiritus sunt, tunc eadem vertuntur in talia qualia adulteriorum et scortationum sunt {3}; inde est quod contaminationes boni et perversiones veri describantur in Verbo per adulteria 
et scortationes, ac quod ita quoque appellentur; ut manifeste constare potest ab his locis; apud Ezechielem, 	Scortata es propter nomen tuum; et effudisti scortationes tuas super omnem transeuntem:... 
sumpsisti de 	vestibus tuis, et fecisti tibi excelsa variegata, et scortata es super illis:... accepisti vasa ornatus tui ex auro Meo et ex argento Meo, quod dederam tibi, et fecisti tibi imagines masculi, 
et scortata es cum eis: sumpsisti filios tuos et filias tuas, quas peperisti Mihi, et sacrificasti illos eis. Num parum de scortationibus tuis?... scortata es cum filiis Aegypti vicinis tuis, 
magnis carne, et multiplicasti scortationem tuam ad irritandum Me;... Scortata es cum filiis Asshuris,... et scortata eis {4}, et non saturata: et multiplicasti scortationem tuam, usque ad 	terram negotiationis, 
Chaldaeam, et tamen in hoc non satiata es, xvi 15-17, 20, 26, 28, 29, seq.; </p>
<p>ubi de Hierosolyma, per quam ibi significatur Ecclesia perversa quoad vera; quod omnia illa `prorsus alia' significent, 
quisque videre potest; quod perversum Ecclesiae dicatur `scortatio,' patet; [3] `vestes' ibi sunt vera quae pervertuntur; inde falsa quae coluntur, sunt `excelsa variegata, cum quibus scortatio'; 
quod `vestes' sint vera, videatur n. 1073, et quod `excelsa' sint cultus, n. 796; `vasa ornatus ex auro et argento quod dederam' sunt cognitiones boni et veri a Verbo per quas confirmant falsa, quae 
cum apparent sicut vera, vocantur `imagines masculi, cum quibus scortatio'; quod `vasa ornatus ex auro et argento' sint cognitiones boni et veri, patet a significatione `auri' quod sit bonum, n. 113, 
1551, 1552, et `argenti' quod sit verum, n. 1551, 2048; `imagines masculi' quod appareant sicut vera, n. 2046; quod `filii et filiae, quas pepererunt et sacrificarunt eis' sint vera et bona quae perverterunt, 
patet a significatione `filiorum et filiarum,' n. 489-491, 533, 2362; quod `scortari cum filiis Aegypti' sit pervertere illa per scientifica, patet a significatione `Aegypti' quod sit scientificum, 
n. 1164, 1165, 1186, 1462; `scortari cum filiis Asshuris' quod sit pervertere per ratiocinia, patet a significatione `Asshuris' quod sit ratiocinatio, n. 119, 1186; `multiplicare scortationem 
usque ad terram Chaldaeam' quod sit usque ad profanationem veri, quae est `Chaldaea,' n. 1368; inde liquet qualis sensus internus Verbi est in ipso sensu litterae.  [4] Similiter alibi apud eundem 
Prophetam, 	Duae mulieres, filiae unius matris, scortatae sunt in Aegypto in adolescentia sua scortatae sunt;... Ohola Samaria, Oholiba Hierosolyma; scortata est Ohola sub Me, et dilexit amasios {5} 
suos Assyrios propinquos,... dedit scortationes suas super illos: delectum filiorum Asshuris omnium;... scortationes suas ex Aegypto non deseruit, nam 	cum illa concubuerunt in adolescentia ejus.... Oholiba 
corrupit amorem suum prae illa, et scortatione.' suas supra scortationes sororis suae, filios Asshuris adamavit;... addidit {6} ad scortationes suas, et vidit imagines Chaldaeorum,... adamavit 
eos ad aspectum oculorum suorum; venerunt ad illam filii Babelis ad concubitum amorum, xxiii 	(x)25, 7, 8, 11, 12, 14, 16, 17; </p>
<p>`Samaria' est Ecclesia quae in affectione veri, `Hierosolyma' quae in affectione 
boni, quarum `scortationes cum Aegyptiis et filiis Asshuris sunt perversiones boni et veri per scientifica et ratiocinia quibus falsa confirmantur, ut patet a significatione `Aegypti,' n. 1164, 
1165, 1186, 1462, et `Asshuris,' n. 119, 1186; et quod usque ad profanum cultum qui quoad verum est `Chaldaea,' n. 1368, et quoad bonum sunt `filii Babelis,' n. 1182, 1326: [5] apud Esaiam, 	Et erit 
a fine septuaginta annorum, visitabit Jehovah Tyrum et redibit ad quaestum meretricium suum, et scortabitur cum omnibus regnis terrae, xxiii 17; </p>
<p>est venditatio falsi, quae per `quaestum meretricium 
et scortationem Tyri' significatur; quod `Tyrus' sint cognitiones veri, videatur n. 1201 quod `regna' sint vera cum quibus scortatio, n. 1672: [6] apud Jeremiam, 	Tu scortata es cum sociis multis; 
et revertere ad Me; tolle oculos tuos ad colles, et vide ubi non constuprata fueris, super viis sedisti eis, sicut Arabs in deserto, et profanasti terram scortationibus tuis, et malitia tua, iii 1, 2; </p>
<p>`scortari 
et scortationibus profanare terram' est pervertere et falsificare vera Ecclesiae; [7] quod `terra' sit Ecclesia, videatur n. 662, 1066, 1067: apud eundem, 	A voce scortationis suae profanavit 
terram, moechata	cum lapide et ligno, iii. 9; </p>
<p>`moechari cum lapide et ligno' est pervertere vera et bona cultus externi; quod `lapis' sit tale verum, videatur n. 643, 1298, quod `lignum tale bonum, 
n. 643: [8] apud eundem, 	Propterea quod fecerant stultitiam in Israele, et adulterati sunt cum uxoribus sodalium suorum, et locuti sunt verbum in nomine Meo, falsum, quod non praecepi, xxix 23; </p>
<p>[9] 
`adulterari cum uxoribus sodalium' est docere falsum sicut ab illis: apud eundem, 	In prophetis Hierosolymae vidi turpitudinem, adulterando et eundo in falso, xxiii 14; </p>
<p>ubi `adulterari' spectat 
bonum quod contaminatur, `ire in falso' spectat verum quod pervertitur: apud eundem, 	Adulteria tua, et hinnitus tui, foeditas scortationis tuae super collibus, in agro, vidi abominationes tuas; vae 
tibi Hierosolyma, non mundaris posthac, quousque adhuc, xiii 	27: </p>
<p>[10] apud Hosheam, 	Scortatio, et vinum, et mustum occupavit cor; populus Meus lignum interrogat, et baculus ejus indicabit id, quia 
spiritus scortationis seduxit; et scortati sunt de sub deo suo; super verticibus montium sacrificant, et super collibus suffiunt, sub quercu, {7} populo et robore, propterea scortantur filiae vestrae, 
et nurus vestrae adulterantur. 	Nonne visitavero super filias vestras quia scortantur, et super nurus vestras quia adulterantur, quia hi cum scortis dividunt, et cum prostibulis sacrificant? iv 11-14; </p>
<p>quid 
singula haec in sensu interno significant, constare potest a significatione `vini' quod sit falsum, `musti' quod sit malum inde, `ligni quod interrogatur' quod sit bonum jucundi alicujus cupiditatis, 
`baculi qui indicabit' quod sit potentia imaginaria sui intellectus, tum `montium et collium' quod sint amores sui et mundi, `quercus, populi (o)et roboris' quod sint totidem crassae, quibus 
fidunt, perceptiones inde {8}, `filiarum et nuruum' quod sint affectiones tales; inde patet quid per `scortationes, adulteria, et prostibula' ibi significantur: [11] apud eundem, 	Israel scortatus es 
super Deo tuo, dilexisti quaestum meretricium super omnibus areis frumenti, ix 1; </p>
<p>`quaestus meretricius' pro venditatione falsi: apud Mosen, 	Ne pangas foedus habitatori terrae, et scortentur post 
deos eorum, ac sacrificent diis eorum, et vocet te, et comedas de sacrificiis ejus, et accipias de filiabus ejus filiis tuis, et scortentur filiae ejus post deos `eorum, et scortari faciant filios tuos 
post deos eorum {9}, Exod. xxxiv 15, 16: </p>
<p>apud eundem, 	Exscindam omnes scortantes post eum, scortando post Molechum, e medio populi eorum: et anima, quae respicit ad pythones et ad hariolos, ad scortandum 
post eos, dabo facies 	Meas contra animam hanc, et exscindam eum e medio populi ejus, Lev. xx 5, 6: </p>
<p>apud eundem, 	Filii vestri erunt pascentes in deserto quadraginta annis, e portabunt scortationes 
vestras; usque ad consumi corpora vestra in deserto, Num. xiv 33: </p>
<p>apud eundem, 	Recordemini omnium praeceptorum Jehovae, et faciatis 	ea, et non pervestigetis post cor vestrum, et post oculos 
	vestros, post quos vos scortamini, Num. xv 39: </p>
<p>[12] adhuc manifestius apud Johannem, 	Unus angelus dixit, Veni, monstrabo tibi judicium meretricis magnae sedentis super aquis multis, cum qua scortati 
sunt reges terrae, et inebriati sunt vino scortationis ejus inhabitantes terram, Apoc. xvii 1, 2; </p>
<p>`meretrix magna' pro (c)iis qui in profano cultu sunt; `aquae multae super quas sedet' sunt cognitiones, 
n. 28, 739; `reges terrae qui cum ea scortati' sunt vera Ecclesiae, n. 1672, 2015, 2069; `vinum quo inebriati' est falsum, n. 1071, 1072; quia `vinum et inebriatio' illa significant, de filiabus 
Loti dicitur, quod `propinaverint patri suo vinum,' vers. 32, 33, 35: [13] apud eundem, 	Babylon ex vino furoris scortationis suae potavit omnes gentes, et reges terrae cum ea scortati sunt, Apoc. 
xviii 3; </p>
<p>`Babylon seu Babel' pro cultu cujus externa apparent sancta, sed interiora sunt profana, n. 1182, 1295, 1326; `gentes quas potat' sunt bona quae profanantur, n. 1259, 1260, 1416, 1849, `reges 
qui {10} cum ea scortati' sunt vera {11}, n. 1672, 2015, 2069: apud eundem, 	Vera et justa judicia Domini Dei, quia judicavit meretricem magnam, quae corrupit terram scortatione sua, Apoc. xix 
2; </p>
<p>`terra' pro Ecclesia, n. 566, 662, 1066, 1067, 2117, 2118.  [14] Quia `scortationes' talia significabant, ac `filiae' affectiones, ideo tam severe prohibitum erat, ut filia sacerdotis scortaretur, 
de qua ita apud Mosen, 	Filia viri sacerdotis, quod coeperit ad scortandum, patrem ea profanans, igne comburetur, Lev. xxi 9: </p>
<p>	tum quod non inferrent quaestum meretricium... in domum Jehovae, quia 
abominatio, Deut. xxiii 19; </p>
<p>et ideo talis processus inquisitorius de uxore, de qua vir suspicionem adulterii captavit, Num. v 12-31, in quo omnia et singula se referunt ad adulterationes boni.  Praeterea 
adulteriorum et scortationum plura sunt genera et (t)adhuc plures species, de quibus in Verbo; hoc genus quod describitur per concubitum filiarum Loti cum patre, est quod vocatur `Moabus et filius 
Ammonis,' de qua mox sequitur. 	@1 i et quod sit ipsum conjugium caeleste,$ 	@2 caelestia et spiritualia, quae in caelo, cum.$ 	@3 After qualia.$ 	@4 In n 10648 scortata es cum eis.$ 	@5 i super.$ 	@6
