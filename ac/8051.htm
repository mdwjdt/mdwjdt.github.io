<h3 align="center" class="ired">属天的奥秘 第8051节</h3>
<h4 align="center"></h4><p><strong>8051.</strong>“有酵之物都不可吃”表他们不可将被歪曲的任何事物变成他们自己的。这从“吃”和“酵”的含义清楚可知：“吃”是指变成人自己的（参看<a href="3168.htm">3168</a>，<a href="3513.htm">3513</a>e，<a href="3596.htm">3596</a>，<a href="4745.htm">4745</a>节）；“酵”是指虚假（<a href="2342.htm">2342</a>，<a href="7906.htm">7906</a>节），因此“有酵之物”是指被歪曲的某种事物。至于将虚假和被歪曲的某种事物变成人自己的，要知道，凡处于良善，并由此想知道真理的人不可能将诸如此类的虚假，或被歪曲之物变成他自己的，只有陷入邪恶，并由此不想知道真理的人才会。处于良善，并由此想知道真理的人之所以不可能将诸如此类的虚假变成他自己的，是因为他以正确的方式思想神、神的国和属灵生命，因而以这种方式利用虚假，即：它不会与他们相悖，而是以某种方式与他们一致。他就这样将虚假软化，它的严厉或坚硬无一进入他的观念。若非如此，几乎没有人能得救，因为虚假比真理更盛行。然而，要知道，处于良善的人也拥有对真理的爱；故在来世，当被天使教导时，他们就会弃绝虚假，领受真理。他们照着他们在世上所拥有的对真理之爱的程度而如此行。</p>

And what is leavened shall not be eaten. That this signifies that there shall not be appropriated anything falsified, is evident from the signification of "eating," as being to appropriate (see n. 3168, 
3513, 3596, 4745); and from the signification of "leaven," as being falsity (n. 2342, 7906); consequently "what is leavened" denotes what is falsified. As regards the appropriation of falsity and 
of that which is falsified, be it known that falsity and that which is falsified cannot be appropriated as such to anyone who is in good and from this desires to be in truth, but only to him who is in 
evil and from this does not desire to be in truth. That to him who is in good and from this desires to be in truth, falsity is not appropriated as falsity, is because he thinks well with respect to God, 
the kingdom of God, and spiritual life, and consequently he applies falsity so as not to be contrary to those things, but in some way to be in accord with them; thus he softens it, and the asperity 
and hardness of it does not come into his idea. Unless this were the case, scarcely anyone could be saved, for falsities are more prevalent than truths. But be it known that they who are in good are 
also in the love of truth, and therefore in the other life, when they are instructed by angels, they reject falsities and accept truths, and this according to the degree of the love of truth which they 
had in the world. </p>

'And nothing made with yeast shall be eaten' means that they shall not make anything that has been falsified their own. This is clear from the meaning of 'eating' as making one's own, dealt with in <a href="3168.htm">3168</a>, <a href="3513.htm">3513</a> (end), <a href="3596.htm">3596</a>, <a href="4745.htm">4745</a>; and from the meaning of 'yeast' as falsity, dealt with in <a href="2342.htm">2342</a>, <a href="7906.htm">7906</a>, so that 'something made with yeast' is something falsified. So far as making falsity and making something 
falsified one's own are concerned, it should be recognized that no falsity as such or anything falsified as such can be made his own by anyone who is governed by good and therefore wishes to know 
the truth, only by someone who is ruled by evil and therefore has no wish to know the truth. The reason why one who is governed by good and therefore wishes to know the truth cannot make falsity as such 
his own is that he thinks in a proper way about God, about God's kingdom, and about spiritual life, and therefore uses falsity in such a way that it is not at odds with them but somehow in agreement. 
Thus he softens it, and none of its harshness or hardness enters his ideas. If this were not so scarcely anyone could be saved, for falsities are more prevalent than truths. Yet it should be recognized 
that people governed by good also have a love of truth, and therefore in the next life, when instructed by angels, they cast falsities aside and embrace truths. They do this according to the degree 
of the love of truth they had in the world. </p>

`Et non comedetur fermentatum': quod significet quod non appropriabitur ullum falsificatum, constat ex significatione `comedere' quod sit appropriare, de qua n. 3168, 3513 fin., 3596, 4745; et ex significatione 
`fermenti' quod sit falsum, de qua n. 2342, 7906, inde `fermentatum' est falsificatum.  Quod appropriationem falsi et falsificati attinet, sciendum quod falsum et falsificatum non alicui 
approprietur, sicut falsum et falsificatum, qui in bono est et inde vult in vero esse, sed illi qui in malo est et inde non vult in vero esse; quod ei qui in bono est et inde vult in vero esse non approprietur 
falsum ut falsum, est quia cogitat bene de Deo, de regno Dei, deque vita spirituali, et inde applicat {1}falsum ut non contra haec sit, sed ut aliquo modo concordet; ita lenit illud, (d)et asperum 
(c)ac durum ejus non venit in ideam; nisi hoc foret, vix aliquis salvari posset, nam falsa prae veris regnant; sed sciendum quod qui in bono sunt etiam in amore veri sint, quare cum in altera vita 
instruuntur ab angelis, rejiciunt falsa et acceptant {2} vera, et hoc secundum gradum amoris veri quem in mundo habuerunt. 	@1 id$ 	@2 i et agnoscunt$ </p>
