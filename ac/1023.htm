<h3 align="center" class="ired">属天的奥秘 第1023节</h3>
<h4 align="center"></h4><p><strong>1023.</strong>“看哪，我要立我的约”表主以仁爱临在。这从前面所论述（<a href="666.htm">666</a>节）的“立约”的含义清楚可知，那里说明，“立约”表重生，尤其表主藉着爱与重生之人的结合。那里还说明，天堂的婚姻就是圣约本身，因此，天堂的婚姻只存在于一切重生之人身上。该婚姻或圣约的性质在前面也已说明。<br />对上古教会成员来说，天堂的婚姻存在于他自己的意愿区域，而对古教会成员来说，天堂的婚姻则在他自己的觉知区域产生。事实上，当人心智的意愿部分全然败坏后，主就以奇妙的方式将他自己的觉知区域从已败坏的意愿部分那里分离出来，并在他自己的觉知区域形成一个新的意愿，这个新意愿就是良知。主将仁爱注入良知，将纯真注入仁爱，从而将祂自己与人结合起来，换句话说，与他立约。<br />人自己的意愿区域能与该觉知部分分离到什么程度，主就会与他同在，或将祂自己与他结合，或与他立约到什么程度。试探和类似的重生手段会使人自己的意愿区域沉寂下来，化为乌有，如同死去。只要这一切得以成就，主就会通过植入在人自己的觉知区域中的良知在仁爱中运作。这就是此处所谓的“立约”。</p>

<p><strong>[NCE]1023.</strong> The symbolism of And I — yes, I — am setting up my pact as the presence of the Lord in charity can be seen from the symbolism of a pact, given in  [<a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_1023/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_665" target=_top>665</a>,] <a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_1023/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_666" target=_top>666</a>. That section showed that a pact symbolizes rebirth, and more especially the Lord's close connection with a regenerate person through love. It also showed that the heavenly marriage is the most genuine compact, and in consequence that the heavenly marriage inside everyone who has regenerated is such a covenant too.<br />The nature of this marriage — this covenant — has also been shown before [<a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_1023/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_155" target=_top>155</a>, <a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_1023/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_162" target=_top>162</a>, <a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_1023/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_252" target=_top>252</a>].<br />[2] For the people of the earliest church, the heavenly marriage existed within the sensation that they had their own power of will. For the people of the ancient church, however, the heavenly marriage developed within the sensation that their power of understanding was their own. When the human race's willpower had become thoroughly corrupt, you see, the Lord split our intellectual sense of self off from that corrupted voluntary sense of self in a miraculous way. Within our intellectual selfhood he formed a new will, which is conscience, and into conscience he injected charity, and into charity innocence. In this way he joined himself to us or, to put it another way, entered into a compact with us.<br />[3] To the extent that our self-will can be detached from this sense of intellectual autonomy, the Lord can be present with us, or bind himself to us, or enter into a pact with us.<br />Times of trial and other similar means of regeneration suppress our self-will to the point where it seems to disappear and almost die out. To the extent that this happens, the Lord can work through the conscience implanted in charity within our intellectual selfhood. This, then, is what is being called a pact in the present verse. </p>
<p align="center"><b>Potts(1905-1910) 1023</b></p><p><b>1023.</b>
And I, behold, I establish My covenant. That this signifies the presence of the Lord in charity, is evident from the signification of "covenant" as shown above (n. 666), where it was shown that a "covenant" 
signifies regeneration, and indeed the conjunction of the Lord with the regenerate man by love; and that the heavenly marriage is that veriest covenant itself, and consequently so is the heavenly 
marriage with every regenerate man. This marriage or covenant has been treated of before. With the man of the Most Ancient Church the heavenly marriage was in the Own of his will part, but with the 
man of the Ancient Church the heavenly marriage was effected in the Own of his intellectual part. For when man's will part had become wholly corrupt, the Lord miraculously separated the Own of his intellectual 
part from that corrupt Own of his will part, and in the Own of his intellectual part He formed a new will, which is conscience, and into the conscience insinuated charity, and into the charity 
innocence, and thus conjoined Himself with man, or what is the same, made a covenant with him. So far as the Own of man's will part can be separated from this Own of the intellectual part, the Lord 
can be present with him, or conjoin Himself, or enter into a covenant with him. Temptations and the like means of regeneration cause the Own of man's will part to be quiescent, to become as nothing, 
and as it were to die. So far as this is done the Lord through conscience implanted in the Own of man's intellectual part can work in charity. And this is what is here called a "covenant." </p>

<p align="center"><b>Elliott(1983-1999) 1023</b></p><p><b>1023.</b>
That 'and I, behold I am establishing My covenant' means the Lord's presence in charity becomes clear from the meaning of 'a covenant', dealt with in <a href="666.htm">666</a>, where it was shown that 'a covenant' means regeneration, 
and in particular the conjunction of the Lord with a regenerate person by means of love. It was also shown there that the heavenly marriage is the actual covenant itself, and that consequently 
the heavenly marriage exists with every regenerate person. The nature of this marriage or covenant has also been shown already. </p>
<p></p>
<p><b>[2]</b>
 The heavenly marriage with the member of the Most Ancient Church 
existed in the area of his own will, but the heavenly marriage with the member of the Ancient Church came into existence in the area of his own understanding. Actually when the will part of man's 
mind had become utterly corrupted, the Lord in miraculous fashion separated the area of his own understanding from that corrupted will part, and within the area of man's own understanding He formed 
a new will, which is conscience. Into conscience He infused charity, and into charity innocence, and in this manner joined Himself to man, or what amounts to the same, established a covenant with him. </p>
<p></p>
<p><b>[3]</b>
To the extent that the area of a person's own will can be separated from this understanding part the Lord is able to be present with him, that is, to join Himself or establish a covenant with 
him. Temptations and similar means of regeneration render inactive the area of a person's own will, so that it is reduced to nothing and so to speak dies. To the extent that this happens the Lord can 
operate within charity by means of conscience implanted in the area of a person's own understanding. This is what is called 'a covenant' here. </p>

'Et Ego, ecce Ego erigo foedus Meum': quod significet Domini praesentiam in charitate, constare potest a significatione 'foederis,' de qua n. 666, ubi ostensum, quod foedus significet regenerationem, 
et quidem conjunctionem Domini cum homine regenerato per amorem; et quod conjugium caeleste sit ipsissimum foedus; proinde conjugium caeleste apud unumquemvis hominem regeneratum: quomodo hoc conjugium 
seu foedus se habet, prius quoque ostensum est; conjugium caeleste apud hominem Antiquissimae Ecclesiae luit in ejus proprio voluntario; [2] at conjugium caeleste apud hominem Antiquae Ecclesiae factum 
est in ejus proprio intellectuali; quando enim voluntarium hominis prorsus corruptum factum est, tunc Dominus miraculose separavit proprium ejus intellectuale a proprio isto corrupto voluntario, 
et in proprio ejus intellectuali formavit novam voluntatem, quae est conscientia, et conscientiae insinuavit charitatem, et charitati innocentiam, ac ita conjunxit se, seu quod idem est, iniit foedus, 
cum homine.  [3] Quantum proprium voluntarium hominis separari potest a proprio hoc intellectuali, tantum Dominus praesens apud eum esse, seu se conjungere aut foedus inire cum eo, potest: tentationes 
et similia media regenerationis efficiunt ut proprium voluntarium hominis quiescat, sicut nullum fiat et quasi moriatur; quantum hoc, tantum Dominus per conscientiam proprio intellectuali hominis implantatam 
in charitate operari potest; hoc nunc est quod hic vocatur foedus. </p>
