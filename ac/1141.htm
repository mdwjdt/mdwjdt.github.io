<h3 align="center" class="ired">属天的奥秘 第1141节</h3>
<h4 align="center"></h4><p><strong>1141.</strong>那些被称作“雅弗子孙”的人，就是诸如具有与内在相应的外在敬拜的所有人，也就是说，他们过着简单、友善、互相仁爱的生活，除了外在仪式外也不知道其它教义的教导。那些被称作“含的子孙”之人就是具有败坏的内在敬拜之人。那些被称作“迦南子孙”的人是具有脱离内在的外在敬拜之人。那些被称作“闪的子孙”之人是内在人，他们敬拜主，也爱邻舍。他们的教会类似于我们真正的基督教会。</p>

<p><strong>[NCE]1141.</strong> All the people referred to here as Japheth's sons were such that they engaged in outward worship corresponding to inner worship. In other words, they lived in simple innocence, friendship, and mutual kindness, unaware of any doctrinal affairs beyond their outward ritual.<br />The people referred to as Ham's sons were those who engaged in inward worship that had been corrupted.<br />The people called Canaan's sons were those who engaged in external worship detached from internal.<br />The people termed Shem's sons were people of depth who worshiped the Lord and loved their neighbor, and their church closely resembled the genuine version of our Christian church. </p>

They who are here named "sons of Japheth" were all such as had external worship corresponding to internal; that is, who lived in simplicity, in friendship, and in mutual charity. Nor did they know any 
other doctrinal teachings than external rites. They who are named "sons of Ham" were those who had internal worship corrupted. They who are called "sons of Canaan" were those who had external worship 
separate from internal. They who are called "sons of Shem" were internal men, and worshiped the Lord and loved the neighbor; whose church was nearly like our true Christian Church. </p>

Those who are here named 'sons of Japheth' were all such people as possessed external worship corresponding to internal, that is, people who lived in simplicity, friendship, and mutual charity, and knew 
no other doctrinal teachings than those which existed as external forms of ritual. Those who are named 'sons of Ham' were people who possessed corrupted internal worship. Those who are called 'sons 
of Canaan' were people who possessed external worship separated from internal. Those who are referred to as 'sons of Shem' were internal men, who worshipped the Lord and loved the neighbour. Their Church 
closely resembled the true Christian Church with us. </p>

</p><b>1141.</b>
Qui hic nominantur 'filii Japheti' fuerunt omnes tales ut cultum externum correspondentem interno habuerint, hoc est, qui in simplicitate, in amicitia, et in charitate mutua vixerunt, nec alia doctrinalia 
noverunt quam ritus externos.  Qui nominantur 'filii Hami' fuerunt qui cultum internum corruptum habuerunt.  Qui 'filii Canaanis, vocantur fuerunt qui cultum externum separatum ab interno.  Qui 
'filii Shemi' appellantur, fuerunt interni homines, et coluerunt Dominum et amarunt proximum; quorum Ecclesia fuit paene qualis Ecclesia nostra Christiana vera. </p>
