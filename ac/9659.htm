<h3 align="center" class="ired">属天的奥秘 第9659节</h3>
<h4 align="center"></h4><p><strong>9659.</strong>“必有八块板和它们的银座”表在各个方面从良善并通过源于良善的真理所提供的支撑。这从“八”、“板”和“银座”的含义清楚可知：“八”是指在各个方面，如下文所述；“板”是指提供支撑的良善（参看<a href="9634.htm">9634</a>节）；“银座”是指通过源于良善的真理所提供的支撑（<a href="9643.htm">9643</a>节）。<br />“八”表示在各个方面的原因是，这个数字与“二”、“四”所表相同，因为它是这两个数字的乘积，而“二”和“四”表示结合，直至完全或完整结合（<a href="5194.htm">5194</a>，<a href="8423.htm">8423</a>，<a href="8877.htm">8877</a>节），由此也表示完全或完整之物（参看<a href="9103.htm">9103</a>节），进而表示在各个方面完全或完整之物；存在于完全或完整性中的事物在各个方面都是如此。“八”也表示存在于完全或完整性中的事物，以及在各个方面的另一个原因是，“七”表示从开始到结束的一整个时期（<a href="2044.htm">2044</a>，<a href="3845.htm">3845</a>节），因此“第八天”表示一个完全或完整状态，然后一个新的开始便由此开启。这解释了为何男孩在第八天要受割礼（创世记<a href="http://39-27.cn/创17.12.htm">17:12</a>；<a href="http://39-27.cn/创21.4.htm">21:4</a>），因为“割礼”表示通过信之真理从污秽的爱中洁净（<a href="2039.htm">2039</a>，<a href="2046.htm">2046</a>e，<a href="2799.htm">2799</a>，<a href="3412.htm">3412</a>，<a href="3413.htm">3413</a>，<a href="4462.htm">4462</a>节）。包皮对应于这些爱对良善的玷污（<a href="4462.htm">4462</a>，<a href="7045.htm">7045</a>，<a href="7225.htm">7225</a>节），执行割礼所用的“火石刀”表示信之真理，洁净通过信之真理实现（<a href="2039.htm">2039</a>e，<a href="2046.htm">2046</a>e，<a href="2799.htm">2799</a>，<a href="7044.htm">7044</a>节）。<br />在弥迦书，“七”之后的“八”也表示存在于完全或完整性中的事物，以及在各个方面：<br />当亚述人进入我们的领地，践踏我们宫殿的时候，我们就立起七个牧者、人中八个首领毁灭他。他们必用剑牧养亚述地；他必拯救我们脱离那亚述人。（弥迦书<a href="http://39-27.cn/弥5.5.htm">5:5</a>，<a href="http://39-27.cn/弥5.6.htm">6</a>）<br />“亚述”表示基于人自己的聪明推理教会的良善和真理；带来毁灭的“人中八个首领”表示从由此而来的虚假中当中完全或各个方面上的拯救；“人中首领”是指首要的良善之真理。<br />“八”表示完全或完整性，以及在各个方面，这一点从关于准许并接纳某些社群到天堂的经历也明显看出来，对此，可参看前文（<a href="2130.htm">2130</a>节）。我看见首先被接纳的社群数目有十二个之多，后来又有八个；因为被准许并接入天堂的人是那些已经从尘世事物，也就是从对它们的一切爱中洁净，后来继续接受教导的人；那时，数字“八”表示完全或完整之物。<br />“八”在圣言的其它地方也具有类似含义，如经上说，门廊距离房子“八肘”，登“八个台阶”上到这房（以西结书<a href="http://39-27.cn/结40.9.htm">40:9</a>，<a href="http://39-27.cn/结40.31.htm">31</a>，<a href="http://39-27.cn/结40.41.htm">41</a>）。那里描述了一个新殿，新殿表示主的一个新教会；“门廊”和“台阶”表示通向良善的真理，以及从良善回到真理。<br />人若不知道圣言中所用的数字暗含属灵事物或真实事物，就不可能看见以西结书中所描述的帐幕、所罗门的殿，之后的新房、新殿和新地的尺寸和数字中的任何这类真实事物，因而看不见任何神圣之物，尽管在圣言中，没有一个音节是没有灵义的。让所有的聪明人都在心里认真考虑一下，以西结书40-48章中的尺寸和数字，以及启示录（<a href="http://39-27.cn/启21.17.htm">21:17</a>）中约翰所提到的尺寸和数字，其真正含义是什么；在启示录，经上说天使量新耶路撒冷的城墙，共有一百四十四肘，是按着人的尺寸，就是天使的尺寸；在另一处经文中说：“凡有聪明的，可以算计兽的数目，因为这是人的数目。他的数目是六百六十六”（启示录<a href="http://39-27.cn/启13.18.htm">13:18</a>）；除此之外还有其它许多经文给出的数字。圣言中所提到的一切数字都表示真实事物（参看<a href="482.htm">482</a>，<a href="487.htm">487</a>，<a href="575.htm">575</a>，<a href="647.htm">647</a>，<a href="648.htm">648</a>，<a href="755.htm">755</a>，<a href="813.htm">813</a>，<a href="1963.htm">1963</a>，<a href="1988.htm">1988</a>，<a href="2075.htm">2075</a>，<a href="2252.htm">2252</a>，<a href="3252.htm">3252</a>，<a href="4264.htm">4264</a>，<a href="4495.htm">4495</a>，<a href="4670.htm">4670</a>，<a href="5265.htm">5265</a>，<a href="5291.htm">5291</a>，<a href="5335.htm">5335</a>，<a href="5708.htm">5708</a>，<a href="6175.htm">6175</a>，<a href="7973.htm">7973</a>节，以及说明某些数字的具体含义的地方）。</p>

And there shall be eight planks, and their bases of silver. That this signifies support in every way by good, and through the truth which is from good, is evident from the signification of "eight," as 
being in every way, of which in what follows; from the signification of "planks," as being the good which supports (see n. 9634); and from the signification of "bases of silver," as being support through 
the truth which is from good (n. 9643). [2] That "eight" denotes in every way is because by this number is signified the same as by "two," and by "four," for it arises from these multiplied together, 
and by "two" and "four" is signified conjunction to the full (n. 5194, 8423, 8877), and from this also what is full (see n. 9103), and consequently in every way; for that which is in fullness is 
also in every way. By "eight" is also signified what is full and in every way, from the fact that by a "week" is signified an entire period from beginning to end (n. 2044, 3845); consequently by "the 
eighth day" is signified a full state, from which there is afterward made a new beginning. From this it was that male children were circumcised when eight days old (Gen. 17:12; 21:4); for by "circumcision" 
was signified purification from filthy loves by means of the truth of faith (n. 2039, 2046, 2799, 3412, 3413, 4462); the foreskin corresponded to the defilement of good by these loves (n. 4462, 
7045, 7225); and "the sword of stone," with which the circumcision was performed, signified the truth of faith by means of which purification is effected (n. 2039e, 2046e, 2799, 7044). [3] What is 
full and in every way is also signified by "eight" after "seven," in Micah: </p>
<p>     When Asshur shall come into our land, and shall tread our palaces, then shall we set over him seven shepherds and eight 
princes of men. And they shall feed on the land of Asshur with the sword; and He shall deliver us from Asshur (Micah 5:5, 6); </p>
<p>"Asshur" denotes reasoning about the goods and truths of the church from 
man's own intelligence; total or complete deliverance from the falsity thence, is signified by the "eight princes of men who shall destroy;" the "princes of men" denote the primary truths of good. [4] 
That "eight" denotes what is full, and in every way, is also plain from experience concerning the admission and reception of societies into heaven (as may be seen above, n. 2130). The societies that 
were first received appeared up to twelve in number, and afterward eight; for those who are admitted and received into heaven are those who have been purified from earthly things, and therefore from 
the loves of them, and who have afterward been instructed; by the number "eight" was then signified what is full. [5] The like is signified by "eight" in other parts of the Word, as by the porch of 
the gate from the house being "eight ells," and by there being "eight steps" to the house, in Ezekiel 40:9, 31, 41. A new house is there treated of, by which is signified a New Church of the Lord; the 
truths which lead to good, and from good to truths, are signified by the porch and by the steps. [6] He who knows not that in the Word numbers infold realities, is bound to get the idea that where 
the tabernacle, the temple of Solomon, and afterward a new house, and a new temple, and a new earth, are described in Ezekiel, the measurements and numbers have no real meaning, and therefore no holiness, 
although in the Word not a syllable is void of meaning. Let him who has intelligence consider the measurements and numbers in Ezekiel, from chapter 40 to chapter 48, and the measurements and numbers 
given by John in the Revelation, chapter 21, where also it is said that "the angel measured the wall of the New Jerusalem a hundred forty and four cubits," and that "this measure is that of a man, 
that is, of an angel" (verse 17); also in another passage: "He that hath intelligence, let him compute the number of the beast; for it is the number of a man, and his number is six hundred and sixty-six" 
(Rev. 13:18); besides those given in many other passages. (That all the numbers mentioned in the Word signify real things, see n. 482, 487, 575, 647, 648, 755, 813, 1963, 1988, 2075, 2252, 3252, 
4264, 4495, 4670, 5265, 5291, 5335, 5708, 6175, 7973; and in the places where it has been shown what is signified by some numbers in particular.) </p>

<p align="center"><b>Elliott(1983-1999) 9659</b></p><p><b>9659.</b>
'And there shall be eight boards and their bases [made] from silver' means support in every respect from good and through truth that springs from good. This is clear from the meaning of 'eight' as what 
is so in every respect, dealt with below; from the meaning of 'boards' as good that lends support, dealt with in <a href="9634.htm">9634</a>; and from the meaning of 'bases [made] from silver' as support provided through 
truth from good, dealt with in <a href="9643.htm">9643</a>.  </p>
<p></p>
<p><b>[2]</b>
 'Eight' means in every respect because this number has the same meaning as two and four, being the product of these when multiplied together. 'Two' and 'four' 
mean being joined together, completely so, <a href="5194.htm">5194</a>, <a href="8423.htm">8423</a>, <a href="8877.htm">8877</a>, and consequently also mean what is complete, <a href="9103.htm">9103</a>, and therefore what is so in every respect; for what exists in completeness does so 
in every respect. Another reason why 'eight' means what exists in completeness and in every respect is that since 'a week' means a whole period from beginning to end, <a href="2044.htm">2044</a>, <a href="3845.htm">3845</a>, 'the eighth day' means 
a complete state, from which a new beginning then commences. This explains why males had to be circumcised on the eighth day, <a href="http://bible.gospelcom.net/cgi-bin/bible?passage=Gen%2017:12;%2021:4&amp;version=ESV&amp;interface=print&amp;showfn=yes&amp;showxref">Gen 17:12; 21:4</a>, for circumcision was a sign of purification from foul 
kinds of love by means of the truth of faith, <a href="2039.htm">2039</a>, <a href="2046.htm">2046</a> (end), <a href="2799.htm">2799</a>, <a href="3412.htm">3412</a>, <a href="3413.htm">3413</a>, <a href="4462.htm">4462</a>. The foreskin corresponded to the defilement of good by those kinds of love, <a href="4462.htm">4462</a>, <a href="7045.htm">7045</a>, <a href="7225.htm">7225</a>, and the knife of flint 
with which circumcision was carried out was a sign of the truth of faith by means of which purification was accomplished, <a href="2039.htm">2039</a> (end), <a href="2046.htm">2046</a> (end), <a href="2799.htm">2799</a>, <a href="7044.htm">7044</a>.  </p>
<p></p>
<p><b>[3]</b>
 What exists in completeness and 
in every respect is also meant by 'eight' following 'seven' in Micah,  </p>
<blockquote>
When Asshur comes into our land and treads our palaces we will set up over him seven shepherds and eight princes of men (homo), 
and they will feed<A name="fntext1"></a><A href="#fn1"><sup>a</sup></a> the land of Asshur with the sword; and he will deliver [us] from Asshur. <a href="http://bible.gospelcom.net/cgi-bin/bible?passage=Micah%205:5,%206&amp;version=ESV&amp;interface=print&amp;showfn=yes&amp;showxref">Micah 5:5, 6</a>.  
</blockquote>
<p>'Asshur' stands for reasoning on the basis of one's own intelligence about the Church's 
forms of good and its truths. Deliverance totally or in every respect from consequent falsity is meant by 'eight princes of men' who will bring destruction, 'princes of men' being the leading truths 
that rise out of good.  </p>
<p></p>
<p><b>[4]</b>
 The fact that 'eight' means completeness and in every respect is also clear from an experience I had involving the admission and reception of some communities into heaven, 
about which see <a href="2130.htm">2130</a>. I saw as many as twelve communities received first, and after them as many as eight more; for people admitted and received into heaven are those who have been purified from 
earthly things, that is, from all love of them, and have gone on to receive instruction. The number eight on that occasion was a sign of that which was complete.  </p>
<p></p>
<p><b>[5]</b>
 'Eight' has a similar meaning 
elsewhere in the Word, for example where it says that the portico of the gateway was 'eight cubits' long from the house, and that there were 'eight steps' up to the house, in <a href="http://bible.gospelcom.net/cgi-bin/bible?passage=Ezekiel%2040:9,%2031,%2041&amp;version=ESV&amp;interface=print&amp;showfn=yes&amp;showxref">Ezekiel 40:9, 31, 41</a>. The 
description there is of the new house, by which the Lord's New Church is meant, truths leading to good and from good back to truths being meant by 'the portico' and 'the steps'.  </p>
<p></p>
<p><b>[6]</b>
 Anyone who does 
not know that spiritual realities or real things are implied by the numbers used in the Word cannot possibly see any such reality nor thus anything holy in the measures and numbers where the tabernacle, 
Solomon's temple, and after these the new house, new temple, and new land in Ezekiel, are described, when yet not a syllable in the Word is devoid of spiritual meaning. Let all who have intelligence 
weigh up in their mind what the measures and numbers in Chapters <a href="40.htm">40</a>-<a href="48.htm">48</a> of Ezekiel really mean, also the measures and numbers in John, at <a href="http://bible.gospelcom.net/cgi-bin/bible?passage=Revelation%2021:17&amp;version=ESV&amp;interface=print&amp;showfn=yes&amp;showxref">Revelation 21:17</a>, where it says that the angel measured the 
wall of the new Jerusalem, a hundred and forty-four cubits, and that this measure was that of a man (homo), that is, of an angel, and also in the following, besides many other places,  </p>
<p>Let him who 
has intelligence reckon the number of the beast, for it is the number of a man (homo), that is, its number is six hundred and sixty-six. <a href="http://bible.gospelcom.net/cgi-bin/bible?passage=Rev%2013:18&amp;version=ESV&amp;interface=print&amp;showfn=yes&amp;showxref">Rev 13:18</a>.  </p>

they mean spiritual realities or real things, see <a href="482.htm">482</a>, <a href="487.htm">487</a>, <a href="575.htm">575</a>, <a href="647.htm">647</a>, <a href="648.htm">648</a>, <a href="755.htm">755</a>, <a href="813.htm">813</a>, <a href="1963.htm">1963</a>, <a href="1988.htm">1988</a>, <a href="2075.htm">2075</a>, <a href="2252.htm">2252</a>, <a href="3252.htm">3252</a>, <a href="4264.htm">4264</a>, <a href="4495.htm">4495</a>, <a href="4670.htm">4670</a>, <a href="5265.htm">5265</a>, <a href="5291.htm">5291</a>, <a href="5335.htm">5335</a>, <a href="5708.htm">5708</a>, <a href="6175.htm">6175</a>, <a href="7973.htm">7973</a>, and places where the specific
