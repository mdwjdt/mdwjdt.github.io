<h3 align="center" class="ired">属天的奥秘 第91节</h3>
<h4 align="center"></h4><p><strong>91.</strong>不过，这些都是隐藏的奥秘，人不可能明了，除非他了解人是如何从属灵者变成属天者的。对于属灵者，外在尚不情愿服从内在，以致造成冲突。等到成为属天者，外在就开始服从内在，冲突因而止息，人获得宁静（参<a href="87.htm">87</a>节），该宁静正是“雨”和“雾气”所象征的，因为它就像一股清流，使外在从内在获得滋润。正是平安所生的宁静，产生了所谓的“田间的灌木”和“田间的草本”，具体而言，就是从属天属灵的源头所生的理性和知识。</p>

<p><strong>[NCE]91.</strong> For one who knows nothing of the conditions a person experiences when changing from spiritual to heavenly, however, the ramifications of all this are impossible to understand, since they are fairly deep mysteries.<br />When we are spiritual, our outer self is not yet willing to obey and serve the inner self, which causes strife. When we become heavenly, then our outer self starts to obey and serve the inner, which brings an end to strife and the beginning of calm (see <a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_91/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_87" target=_top>87</a>). The rain and mist symbolize this calm, because it acts like a mist, coming from our inner self to water and drench the outer self. Such calm, which comes of peace, causes the growth of the "shrub of the field" and the "plant of the field" — specifically, rational ideas and factual knowledge having an origin that is heavenly and spiritual at the same time. </p>

But what these things involve cannot possibly be perceived unless it is known what man's state is while from being spiritual he is becoming celestial, for they are deeply hidden. While he is spiritual, 
the external man is not yet willing to yield obedience to and serve the internal, and therefore there is a combat; but when he becomes celestial, then the external man begins to obey and serve the 
internal, and therefore the combat ceases, and tranquility ensues (see n. 87). This tranquility is signified by "rain" and "mist" for it is like a vapor with which the external man is watered and bedewed 
from the internal; and it is this tranquility, the offspring of peace, which produces what are called the "shrub of the field" and the "herb of the field" which, specifically, are things of the rational 
mind and of the memory [rationalia et scientifica] from a celestial spiritual origin. </p>

<p align="center"><b>Elliott(1983-1999) 91</b></p><p><b>91.</b>
But unless man's state in which, from being spiritual, he is becoming celestial is known, one cannot possibly perceive what these expressions embody, for they are qui the deep arcana. When he is spiritual, 
the external man is not yet willing to comply with and serve the internal man, and so there is conflict. But when he is becoming celestial, the external man starts to comply with and serve the 
internal. As a result conflict ceases, and tranquillity ensues; see <a href="87.htm">87</a>. This tranquillity is meant by 'the rain' and by 'the mist', for it resembles a mist, with which his internal man waters and bathes 
the external. This serenity which is characteristic of Peace brings forth the things which are called 'the shrub of the field' and 'the plant of the field'. Specifically, these are the rational concepts 
and the facts that have a celestial-spiritual origin.  </p>

<p align="center"><b>Latin(1748-1756) 91</b>
</p><b>91.</b>
Sed nisi sciatur status hominis dum a spirituali fit caelestis, nusquam percipi potest quid haec involvant, nam arcaniora sunt. Cum est spiritualis, nondum externus homo obsequia praestare vult servire 
interno, quare est pugna; at cum fit caelestis, tunc externus homo incipit obsequi et servire interno, quare cessat pugna et tranquillitas, vide n. 87; haec tranquillitas significatur per 'pluviam 
et 'vaporem,' nam est instar vaporis, quo irrigatur et perfunditur externus ejus ab interno. Haec tranquillitas, quae est pacis, producit illa quae vocantur 'virgultum agri' et 'herba agri,' quae in 
specie sunt rationalia et scientifica a caelesti spirituali origine.
