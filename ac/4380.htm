<h3 align="center" class="ired">属天的奥秘 第4380节</h3>
<h4 align="center"></h4><p><strong>4380.</strong>“求我主在仆人前头走”表更总体的同在。这从在人“前头走”的含义清楚可知，在人“前头走”，在此处，就是论述良善与真理结合之处，是指更总体的同在。因为对通过良善与真理所实现的重生来说，是良善在起作用，真理使自己被作用。每当良善触及真理，并与它们有稍许联结时，真理看似进行反作用。然而，不是真理，而是被联结到真理或附着于它的良善在通过这真理进行反作用。这种附着就是更总体的同在所表示的。我们说“良善与真理的结合”，意思是指有良善与真理在里面的这个人；因为良善与真理若没有一个主体，也就是人，就是无意义的属性。在天上，人们就以这种方式通过抽象术语来思考和说话，因为他们不将良善与真理归于自己，而是归于主；还因为来自主的良善与真理充满整个天堂。古人也习惯用这类术语来说话。</p>

<p align="center"><b>Potts(1905-1910) 4380</b></p><p><b>4380.</b>
Let my lord I pray pass over before his servant. That this signifies a more general presence, is evident from the signification of "passing on before" anyone, as here (where the conjunction of good with 
truths is treated of) being a more general presence. For in regeneration (which is effected by means of the conjunction of good with truths) it is good which acts, and truth which suffers itself to 
be acted upon; and when good has applied itself to truths and has conjoined itself with them a little, then truth appears to react. Yet it is not truth, but the good that is conjoined or adjoined to 
it, which reacts through the truth. This adjunction is what is meant by a more general presence. It is said "the conjunction of good with truths," but there is meant the man in whom are good and truth; 
for these cannot be predicated without a subject, which is man. In heaven they think and speak in this way by means of abstract things, for the reason that they do not attribute good and truth to themselves, 
but to the Lord; and because good and truth from the Lord fill the whole heaven. To speak in this way was also familiar to the ancients. </p>

<p align="center"><b>Elliott(1983-1999) 4380</b></p><p><b>4380.</b>
'Let my lord now pass over before his servant' means a more general presence. This is clear from the meaning here, where the joining of good to truths is the subject, of 'passing over before anyone' 
as a more general presence. For with regeneration which is achieved by means of the joining of good to truths the situation is that good is that which acts and truth that which allows itself to be acted 
upon. Whenever good has brought itself in touch with truths and linked itself to them a little, truth is seen to react. Yet it is not the truth itself that reacts but the good combined with it or else 
attached to it, doing so by means of that truth. Such an attachment is what is meant by a more general presence. The phrase joining good to truths is used, but what is meant is the person in whom 
goodness and truth are present, for goodness and truth are meaningless attributes if they have no subject - that is, man - to which they can be applied. In heaven people do employ abstract terms such 
as these in their thought and speech, for the reason that they do not attribute good or truth to themselves but to the Lord, and also for the reason that goodness and truth from the Lord fill heaven in 
its entirety. The ancients too were accustomed to employ such terms in their speech. </p>

<p align="center"><b>Latin(1748-1756) 4380</b>
</p><b>4380.</b>
`Transeat quaeso dominus meus ante servum suum': quod significet praesentiam communiorem, constat a significatione `transire ante aliquem' quod hic ubi de conjunctione boni cum veris agitur, sit 
praesentia communior; cum regeneratione enim quae fit per conjunctionem boni cum veris, ita se habet quod bonum sit quod agit et verum quod se agi patitur, cumque bonum se applicuerat veris et se paulisper 
conjunxerat cum illis, tunc apparet verum reagere, at non est verum sed est bonum illi conjunctum vel adjunctum quod per verum reagit; haec adjunctio est quae intelligitur per praesentiam 
communiorem.  Conjunctio boni cum veris dicitur, sed intelligitur homo in quo bonum et verum, nam haec praedicari nequeunt absque subjecto, quod est homo; in caelo per abstracta ita cogitant et loquuntur, 
ex causa quia sibi non tribuunt bonum nec verum, sed Domino, et quia bonum et verum a Domino implet totum caelum; ita loqui etiam antiquis fuit familiare. </p>
