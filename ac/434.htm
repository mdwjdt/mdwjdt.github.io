<p><strong>[NCE]434.</strong> <a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_434/bible_king-james-version_genesis_4_25" target=_top>Genesis 4:25</a>. And the human knew his wife again, and she delivered a son and called his name Seth, "Because God has restored other seed for me in place of Abel, since Cain killed him."<br />The human and his wife mean the new church previously symbolized by Adah and Zillah. Their son, whose name she called Seth, symbolizes a new faith that will allow charity to take hold. God has restored other seed in place of Abel, since Cain killed him means that charity, which Cain separated and extinguished, has now been given to this church as a gift by the Lord. </p>
<p align="center"><b>Potts(1905-1910) 434</b></p><p><b>434.</b>
Verse 25. And the man [homo] knew his wife again, and she bare a son, and called his name Seth; for God hath appointed me another seed instead of Abel, for Cain slew him. The "man" and his "wife" here 
mean the new church signified above by "Adah and Zillah;" and by her "son" whose name was Seth, is signified a new faith, by which charity might be obtained. By "God appointed another seed instead of 
Abel, whom Cain slew" is signified that charity, which Cain had separated and extinguished, was now given by the Lord to this church. </p>

<p align="center"><b>Elliott(1983-1999) 434</b></p><p><b>434.</b>
Verse 25 And the man (homo) knew his wife again, and she bore a son, and she called his name Seth - for God has appointed me another seed in place of Abel, seeing that Cain had killed him.  </p>
<p>'The man' 
and 'his wife' are here used to mean the new Church which earlier on was meant by 'Adah and Zillah'. 'Her son whose name she called Seth' means new faith, through which charity may be received 'God 
has appointed another seed in place of Abel, seeing that Cain had killed him' means that charity, which Cain separated and annihilated, was now conferred on this Church by the Lord.  </p>

</p><b>434.</b>
Vers. 25.  Et cognovit homo adhuc uxorem tuam, et peperit filium, et vocavit nomen ejus Sheth; quia reposuit mihi Deus semen aliud loco Habelis, quod occiderit illum Cain. Per 'hominem et uxorem ejus' 
hic intelligitur nova Ecclesia, prius per 'Adah et Zillah' significata: per 'filium ejus, cujus nomen vocavit Sheth' significatur nova fides per quam charitas: [per] quod 'reposuerit Deus semen aliud 
loco Habelis quod occiderit eum Cain' significatur quod charitas, quam Cain separavit, et exstinxit, nunc a Domino huic Ecclesiae donata sit. </p>
