<h3 align="center" class="ired">属天的奥秘 第6319节</h3>
<h4 align="center"></h4><p><strong>6319.</strong>与人同在的天使的流注，并非那时此人所拥有的那类思维的流注，而是涉及对应关系；因为天使在属灵层面进行思考，而此人则在属世层面觉察天使的思维。因此，对这个人来说，属灵事物会降至它们的对应物，进而降至它们的代表。例如，当人们谈论食物、播种、收割和脂油等等时，天使的思维就涉及爱与仁之良善，依此类推。我曾做过一个很普通的梦，醒来后，就从头到尾讲述了一遍。天使说，这一切与他们的讨论完全一致。我梦见的并不是这些东西，而是对应并代表其讨论的事物；每一个细节都是这样。后来，我与他们谈论了流注。<br />然而，诸如世人用眼睛看见的那类物体不会出现在与此人同在的灵人面前，他们也听不见此人用耳朵所听见的那类话语，而是看见并理解诸如出现在他的思维中的那类事物。思维完全不同于言语，这一点从以下事实明显看出来：人在一瞬间所思考的东西，比他在半小时内所能表达的还要多，因为他的思维从语言的话语当中抽离出来了。由此可在某种程度上得知灵魂与身体的相互作用是何性质，即：它就像灵界进入自然界的流注；因为人的灵魂或灵在灵界，他的身体在自然界。所以，流注照对应关系发生。</p>

As regards the influx of angels with a man, it is not an influx of such thoughts as the man then has, but is according to correspondences; for the angels are thinking spiritually, whereas the man perceives 
this naturally; thus with the man the spiritual things fall into their correspondents, consequently into their representatives. For example, when a man speaks of bread, of seedtime, of harvest, 
of fatness, and the like, the thought of the angels is then about the goods of love and of charity; and so forth. I once dreamed a common dream, and when I awoke, I related all from beginning to end. 
The angels said that all things coincided exactly with those which they had spoken of among themselves; not that these were the same as I had dreamed, but things corresponding and representative, and 
it is the same in every single thing. I afterward talked with them about influx. Objects, however, such as a man sees with his eyes, do not appear before the spirits who are with the man, neither are 
words heard such as the man hears with the ear, but such as the man is thinking. That thought is wholly different from speech, is evident from the fact that man thinks in a moment more than he can utter 
in half an hour, because he thinks abstractedly from the words of language. From this may in some measure be known the nature of the interaction of the soul with the body, namely, that it is such 
as is the influx of the spiritual world into the natural world; for the soul or spirit of man is in the spiritual world, and his body is in the natural world: thus it is according to correspondences. </p>

As regards what flows into a person from the angels present with him, it is not of the same nature as the objects of his thought but is that which involves correspondences; for the angels think on a 
spiritual level, but the person perceives their thought on a natural one. Thus spiritual realities come down into images that correspond to them, consequently into images which represent them and are 
known to the person. When for example the person speaks about bread, sowing, harvest, fatness, and the like, the angels' thought is about aspects of the good of love and charity, and so on. I once had 
a quite ordinary dream, and having woken up I related it all from start to finish. The angels said that it coincided exactly with what they had been discussing. Not that the contents of my dream were 
the same things but ones that corresponded to and represented what they discussed; this was true of every detail. I spoke to them after that about influx. </p>
<p></p>
<p><b>[2]</b>
 Objects are not visible to the spirits 
present with a person in the same way as they are to the person seeing them with his eyes, nor are words apprehended in the same way as they are by a person hearing them with his ears; rather they see 
and apprehend things as they appear in his thought. Thought is altogether different from speech, as is clear from the fact that a person thinks more in a moment of time than he can express in half 
an hour, since his thought does not involve any use of spoken words. From this one may gain some idea of what the interaction between soul and body is like - that it resembles the influx of the spiritual 
world into the natural world, since a person's soul or spirit is in the spiritual world, and his body is in the natural world. Thus influx takes place in accord with correspondences. </p>

<p align="center"><b>Latin(1748-1756) 6319</b>
</p><b>6319.</b>
Quod influxum angelorum apud hominem attinet, non est qualis homo cogitat, sed est secundum correspondentias; angeli enim spiritualiter cogitant, at homo hoc naturaliter percipit; ita cadunt spiritualia 
in sua correspondentia, consequenter in sua repraesentativa apud hominem; sicut pro exemplo, cum loquitur homo de pane, de semente, de messe, de pingui, et similibus, tunc angelorum cogitatio est 
de bonis amoris et charitatis, et sic porro.  Somniavi quondam somnium vulgare; cum evigilatus, narravi omnia a principio ad finem; dicebant angeli quod prorsus coinciderent cum illis quae ii inter se 
locuti sunt; non quod essent eadem quae somniavi, sed correspondentia et repraesentativa, ita singula; locutus cum illis dein de influxu.  [2]Coram spiritibus autem qui apud hominem, non apparent objecta 
qualia homo oculis videt, nec capiuntur verba qualia homo aure audit, sed sicut cogitat homo; quod cogitatio se prorsus aliter habeat quam loquela, constat ex eo quod homo momento plura cogitet 
quam per semihorium eloqui possit, quia cogitat abstracte a vocibus linguae.  Inde aliquatenus sciri potest quale est commercium animae cum corpore, quod nempe sit qualis est influxus mundi spiritualis 
in mundum naturalem; anima enim seu spiritus hominis est in mundo spirituali, et corpus in mundo naturali; ita secundum correspondentias. </p>
