<h3 align="center" class="ired">属天的奥秘 第2403节</h3>
<h4 align="center"></h4><p><strong>2403.</strong>“但他在女婿们眼里却是开玩笑的”表嘲笑。这从“开玩笑”的含义清楚可知，“开玩笑”可以说是指说笑话，讲故事，或胡说八道，因而是指诸如他们会嘲笑的那种事。“在女婿们眼里”表在他们的理性面前，这从“眼”的含义明显可知（<a href="212.htm">212</a>节）。这表明了那些具有信之真理，同时却没有良善生活之人是何秉性。</p>

<p align="center"><b>Potts(1905-1910) 2403</b></p><p><b>2403.</b>
And he was in the eyes of his sons-in-law as one that jested. That this signifies derision, is evident from the signification of "jesting," as being to utter as it were a joke, a fable, or trifles, thus 
such things as they would laugh at. "In their eyes," signifies that which was before their rational, as is evident from the signification of the "eyes" (n. 212). This shows what is the character of 
those who are in the truth of faith and not at the same time in the good of life. </p>

'But he was in the eyes of his sons-in-law like one who was jesting' means cause for laughter. This is clear from the meaning of 'jesting' as the thing being so to speak a joke, just a story, or utter 
nonsense, and so something that they would laugh at. 'In their eyes' means to their rational, as is clear from the meaning of 'eyes' in <a href="212.htm">212</a>. This shows the character of people with whom the truth of 
faith exists but not at the same time the good of life. </p>

`Et fuit sicut ludens in oculis generorum ejus': quod significet irrisionem, constat a significatione `ludere' quod sit esse quasi jocus, fabula, nugae {1}, ita tale quod irriderent: `in oculis eorum' 
significat quod coram rationali eorum, ut constat (c)a significatione `oculorum,' n. 212: inde patet qualis sunt qui in vero fidei et non simul in bono vitae. 	@1 i aut.$ </p>
