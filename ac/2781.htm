<h3 align="center" class="ired">属天的奥秘 第2781节</h3>
<h4 align="center"></h4><p><strong>2781.</strong>“备上驴”表祂所预备的属世人。这从下面所解释的“驴”的含义清楚可知。人里面有意愿之物和理解力之物，源于良善的事物属于前者，源于真理的事物属于后者。各种动物表示源于良善的意愿之物，如羔羊、绵羊、公山羊、母山羊、牛犊、公牛（参看<a href="1823.htm">1823</a>，<a href="2179.htm">2179</a>，<a href="2180.htm">2180</a>节）；还有一些动物表示源于真理的理解力之物，如马、骡、野驴、骆驼和驴，还有鸟。“马”表心智的理解力部分，如前所示（<a href="2761.htm">2761</a>，<a href="2762.htm">2762</a>节）；“野驴”表脱离良善的理性真理（<a href="1949.htm">1949</a>节）；“骆驼”表总的记忆知识，“驴”表具体的记忆知识（<a href="1486.htm">1486</a>节）。<br />有两种元素构成人心智的属世层，或也可说，构成属世人，即属世良善和属世真理。属世良善是从仁与信所流出的快乐，而属世真理是有关它们的记忆知识。属世真理就是“驴”所表示的，理性真理则是“骡”所表示的。这一点从以下经文可以看出来，以赛亚书：<br />论南方牲畜的默示：在艰难困苦之地，就是公狮、母狮、蝮蛇、会飞的火蛇出没之地。埃及的帮助是徒然无益的，所以我称他为“坐而不动的拉哈伯”。他们把财物驮在驴驹的脊背上，将宝物驮在骆驼的肉鞍上，往那不利于他们的民那里去；埃及人的帮助必徒然无益。（以赛亚书<a href="http://39-27.cn/赛30.6.htm">30:6</a>-<a href="http://39-27.cn/赛30.7.htm">7</a>）<br />那些具有良善与真理的认知，但将其存于记忆，却不用于生活的人就被称为“南方牲畜”；论到他们，经上说：“他们把财物驮在驴驹的脊背上，将宝物驮在骆驼的肉鞍上”。因为“驴驹”表具体的记忆知识，“骆驼”表总的记忆知识。“埃及人”表记忆知识（参看<a href="1164.htm">1164</a>，<a href="1165.htm">1165</a>，<a href="1186.htm">1186</a>节）；论到他们，经上说：“埃及人的帮助必徒然无益”。谁都能明显看出，这个默示（即预言）具有内义，否则，没有人理解它。若没有内义，没有人能知道何为“南方牲畜的默示”、“公狮、母狮”、“蝮蛇、会飞的火蛇”；或“他们把财物驮在驴驹的脊背上，将宝物驮在骆驼的肉鞍上”这句话是什么意思，或为何紧接着经上声称“埃及人的帮助必徒然无益”。在以色列对以萨迦的预言中，“驴”具有同样的含义。摩西书：<br />以萨迦是个瘦削的驴，卧在重驮之间。（创世记<a href="http://39-27.cn/创49.14.htm">49:14</a>）<br />撒迦利亚书：<br />耶和华用灾殃攻击那与耶路撒冷争战的列民，必是这样；并且也必有那临到马匹、骡子、骆驼、驴和一切牲畜的灾殃。（撒迦利亚书<a href="http://39-27.cn/亚14.12.htm">14:12</a>，<a href="http://39-27.cn/亚14.15.htm">15</a>）<br />“马匹”、“骡子”、“骆驼”、“驴”表人里面的理解力之物，它们要遭受灾殃。这从前后文的每一个细节明显看出来，因为所论述的主题是发生在最后的审判，或世代的末了之前的灾殃，对于这些灾殃，约翰在启示录中有大量论述，其它先知书也有多处论述。这些动物表示当时那些要与耶路撒冷，即主的属灵教会及其真理开战的人，就其理解力之物而言，他们要遭受这类灾殃。<br />以赛亚书：<br />你们在各水边撒种、使牛驴的脚踏出的有福了。（以赛亚书<a href="http://39-27.cn/赛32.20.htm">32:20</a>）<br />“在各水边撒种的”表那些让自己在属灵事物上接受教导的人，“水”表属灵事物，因而表构成理解力或真理之物（参看<a href="680.htm">680</a>，<a href="739.htm">739</a>，<a href="2702.htm">2702</a>节）。“使牛驴的脚踏出的”表要服侍的属世事物，“牛”表属世的良善（参看<a href="2180.htm">2180</a>，<a href="2566.htm">2566</a>节），“驴”表属世的真理。<br />摩西书：<br />犹大把小驴拴在葡萄树上，把驴驹拴在美好的葡萄树上。他在葡萄酒中洗了衣服，在葡萄汁中洗了袍褂。（创世记<a href="http://39-27.cn/创49.11.htm">49:11</a>）<br />这是雅各，那时是以色列对于主的预言；“葡萄树”和“美好的葡萄树”表属灵的教会，无论外在还是内在（<a href="1069.htm">1069</a>节）；“小驴”表属世真理；“驴驹”表理性真理。“驴驹”表理性真理，其原因在于，“母驴”表对属世真理的情感（<a href="1486.htm">1486</a>节），故它的驴驹表示理性真理（参看<a href="1895.htm">1895</a>，<a href="1896.htm">1896</a>，<a href="1902.htm">1902</a>，<a href="1910.htm">1910</a>节）。<br />过去，士师（即法官）骑母驴，他的儿子骑驴驹；因为士师（即法官）代表教会的良善，他们的儿子代表源这些良善的真理。然而，王骑母骡，他的儿子则骑公骡；因为王和他们的儿子代表教会的真理（参看<a href="1672.htm">1672</a>，<a href="1728.htm">1728</a>，<a href="2015.htm">2015</a>，<a href="2069.htm">2069</a>节）。士师（即法官）骑母驴，这一事实清楚可见于士师记：<br />我心倾向以色列的首领，他们在民中甘心牺牲自己。你们应当颂赞耶和华！骑白母驴的、坐绣花毯子的，你们都当传扬！（士师记<a href="http://39-27.cn/士5.9.htm">5:9</a>-<a href="http://39-27.cn/士5.10.htm">10</a>）<br />法官的儿子则骑驴驹：<br />以色列的士师睚珥有三十个儿子，骑着三十匹驴驹。（士师记<a href="http://39-27.cn/士10.3.htm">10:3</a>-<a href="http://39-27.cn/士10.4.htm">4</a>等等）<br />以色列的士师押顿有四十个儿子，三十个孙子，骑着七十匹驴驹。（士师记<a href="http://39-27.cn/士12.14.htm">12:14</a>）<br />王骑母骡：<br />大卫对他们说，要带领你们主的仆人，使我儿子所罗门骑我的母骡。<br />他们使所罗门骑大卫王的母骡，将他送到基训。祭司撒督和先知拿单在基训已经膏他作王。（列王记上<a href="http://39-27.cn/王上1.33.htm">1:33</a>，<a href="http://39-27.cn/王上1.38.htm">38</a>，<a href="http://39-27.cn/王上1.44.htm">44</a>-<a href="http://39-27.cn/王上1.45.htm">45</a>）<br />王的儿子骑公骡：<br />由于押沙龙，大卫王的众子都起来，各人骑上骡子，逃跑了。（撒母耳记下<a href="http://39-27.cn/撒下13.29.htm">13:29</a>）<br />骑母驴是士师的标志，骑母骡则是王的标志；骑驴驹是士师儿子的标志，骑骡子则是王儿子的标志。因为如前所述，母驴代表和表示对属世的良善与真理的情感，母骡代表和表示对理性真理的情感，驴子或驴驹代表和表示属世真理本身，“骡子”和“母驴驹”代表和表示理性真理。由此明显可知撒迦利亚书中关于主的预言是什么意思：<br />锡安的女子哪，应当大大喜乐！耶路撒冷的女子哪，应当欢呼！看哪，你的王来到你这里！他是公义的，并且施行拯救，谦谦和和地骑着驴，骑着驴驹、母驴的崽子。他的权柄必从这海管到那海，从大河管到地极。（撒迦利亚书<a href="http://39-27.cn/亚9.9.htm">9:9</a>-<a href="http://39-27.cn/亚9.10.htm">10</a>）<br />主即将进入耶路撒冷时，愿意骑这些牲畜。这一事实从福音书明显看出来。如马太福音：<br />耶稣就打发两个门徒，对他们说，你们往对面村子里去，立刻就会看见一匹栓着的母驴，和跟它在一起的驴驹。你们解开，牵到我这里来。这事成就，是要应验先知的话，说：去告诉锡安的女子：看哪，你的王来到你这里，是温柔的，又骑着母驴，骑着驴驹，就是负重的驴的崽。他们牵了母驴和驴驹来，把自己的衣服搭在上面，扶耶稣坐上去。（马太福音<a href="http://39-27.cn/太21.1.htm">21:1</a>-<a href="http://39-27.cn/太21.2.htm">2</a>，<a href="http://39-27.cn/太21.4.htm">4</a>-<a href="http://39-27.cn/太21.5.htm">5</a>，<a href="http://39-27.cn/太21.7.htm">7</a>）<br />“骑着驴”标志着属世人变得顺从，“骑着驴驹，就是母驴的崽”标志着理性也变得顺从。因为“母驴的崽”的含义与“骡子”一样，如前面对创世记（<a href="http://39-27.cn/创49.11.htm">49:11</a>）经文所说明的。由于这个原因，也就是这些牲畜的灵义，还由于骑它们是至高的士师和君王的权力，同时为了主可以成全教会的代表物，故主乐意这样做。对此，约翰福音如此描述：<br />第二天，有许多上来过节的人，听见耶稣将到耶路撒冷，就拿着棕树枝，出去迎接祂，喊着说，和散那！奉主名来的以色列王是应当称颂的！耶稣得了一个驴驹，就骑上，如经上所记的说：锡安的女子，不要惧怕！看哪，你的王骑着母驴驹来了。这些事门徒起先不明白，等到耶稣得了荣耀以后，才想起这些话是指着祂写的，并且他们果然对祂做了这些事。（约翰福音<a href="http://39-27.cn/约12.12.htm">12:12</a>-<a href="http://39-27.cn/约12.16.htm">16</a>；马可福音<a href="http://39-27.cn/可11.1.htm">11:1</a>-<a href="http://39-27.cn/可11.12.htm">12</a>；路加福音<a href="http://39-27.cn/路19.28.htm">19:28</a>-<a href="http://39-27.cn/路19.41.htm">41</a>）<br />由此清楚可知，那时教会的每一个事物都是主的代表物，因而是其国度中的属天和属灵之物的代表物；甚至母驴和母驴驹也是如此，它们代表属世人的良善与真理。具有这种代表性的原因在于，属世人应服务于理性人，理性人应服务于属灵人；而属灵人应服务于属天人，属天人应服务于主。这就是一个从属于另一个的秩序。<br />由于“牛和驴”表及属世人的良善与真理，故提及牛和驴的律法有很多。在神圣的圣言中，乍一看，这些律法似乎不值一提；但当展开它们的内义时，它们里面的灵义就显得极其重要了。如以下经文，摩西书：<br />人若敞着井口，或挖井不遮盖，有牛或驴掉在里头，井主要拿钱赔还本主人，死牲畜要归自己。（出埃及记<a href="http://39-27.cn/出21.33.htm">21:33</a>-<a href="http://39-27.cn/出21.34.htm">34</a>）<br />若遇见你仇敌的牛或驴失迷了路，总要牵回来交给他。若看见恨你人的驴压卧在重驮之下，不愿卸下，务要卸下驴的重驮。（出埃及记<a href="http://39-27.cn/出23.4.htm">23:4</a>-<a href="http://39-27.cn/出23.5.htm">5</a>；申命记<a href="http://39-27.cn/申22.1.htm">22:1</a>，<a href="http://39-27.cn/申22.3.htm">3</a>）<br />你若看见弟兄的驴或牛跌倒在路上，不可佯为不见，总要把牠们拉起来。（申命记<a href="http://39-27.cn/申22.4.htm">22:4</a>）<br />不可并用牛、驴耕地。不可穿羊毛、细麻两样搀杂料做的衣服。（申命记<a href="http://39-27.cn/申22.10.htm">22:10</a>-<a href="http://39-27.cn/申22.11.htm">11</a>）<br />六日你要作工，第七日要安息，使牛、驴可以歇息，并使你婢女的儿子和寄居的都可以休息。（出埃及记<a href="http://39-27.cn/出23.12.htm">23:12</a>）<br />此处“牛和驴”在内义上无非表示属世的良善与真理。</p>

And saddled his ass. That this signifies the natural man which He prepared, is evident from the signification of an "ass," as explained in what now follows. There are in man things of the will and things 
of the understanding; to the former class belong the things of good, to the latter those of truth. There are various kinds of beasts by which the things of the will, or those of good, are signified; 
such as lambs, sheep, kids, goats, bullocks, oxen (see n. 1823, 2179, 2180); and there are likewise beasts by which intellectual things, or those of truth, are signified, namely, horses, mules, wild-asses, 
camels, asses, and also birds. That the intellectual faculty is signified by the "horse," has been shown above (n. 2761, 2762). That by the "wild-ass" truth separate from good is signified, 
see above (n. 1949). That by the "camel" there is signified memory-knowledge in general, and by the "ass" memory-knowledge in particular, may be seen above (n. 1486).  [2] There are two things which 
constitute the natural with man, or what is the same, which constitute the natural man, namely, natural good and natural truth. Natural good is the delight flowing forth from charity and faith; natural 
truth is the memory-knowledge of them. That natural truth is what is signified by the "ass," and rational truth by the "mule," may be seen from the following passages. In Isaiah: </p>
<p>     The prophecy 
of the beasts of the south. In a land of straightness and distress; the lion and the old lion,* and from them the viper and the flying fire-serpent; they carry their riches upon the shoulder of young 
asses, and their treasures upon the hump of camels, to a people that shall not profit; and the Egyptians shall help in vain and to no purpose (Isa. 30:6-7); </p>
<p>those are called the "beasts of the south" 
who are in the knowledges of good and truth, but who make them not of the life but of memory; of whom it is said that "they shall bring their riches upon the shoulder of young asses, and their treasures 
upon the hump of camels," for the reason that "young asses" signify memory-knowledges in particular, and "camels" memory-knowledges in general: that the "Egyptians" are memory-knowledges, may be seen 
above (n. 1164, 1165, 1186); of whom it is said that "they shall help in vain and to no purpose." That this prophecy has an internal sense, without which it is understood by nobody, is plain to everyone; 
for without the internal sense it cannot be known what the prophecy of the beasts of the south is, the lion and the old lion, the viper and the flying fire-serpent; and what is meant by these 
beasts bringing their riches upon the shoulder of young asses, and their treasures upon the hump of camels, and why it immediately follows that the Egyptians shall help in vain and to no purpose. The 
like is meant by the "ass" in the prophecy of Israel respecting Issachar, in Moses: </p>
<p>     Issachar is a bony ass, lying down between the burdens (Gen. 49:14). [3] In Zechariah: </p>
<p>     This shall be the 
plague wherewith Jehovah will smite all the peoples that shall fight against Jerusalem; there shall be the plague of the horse, of the mule, of the camel, and of the ass, and of every beast (Zech. 14:12, 
15); </p>
<p>that by the "horse," "mule," "camel," and "ass," are signified things of the understanding in man, which will be affected by the plague, is evident from all that precedes and follows there; 
for the plagues which precede the last judgment or consummation of the age are treated of, a subject also much treated of by John in Revelation, and by the rest of the prophets in many places. By these 
animals are meant those who will then fight against Jerusalem, that is, against the Lord's spiritual church and its truths, and who will be affected by such plagues as to the things of their understanding. 
 [4] In Isaiah: </p>
<p>     Blessed are ye that sow beside all waters, that send forth the foot of the ox and the ass (Isa. 32:20); </p>
<p>"they that sow beside all waters" denote those who suffer themselves 
to be instructed in spiritual things. (That "waters" are spiritual things, thus intellectual things of truth, may be seen above, n. 680, 739, 2702.) "They that send forth the foot of the ox and 
the ass" denote natural things which are to do service. The "ox" is the natural as to good (see n. 2180, 2566). The "ass" is the natural as to truth.  [5] In Moses: </p>
<p>     Binding his young ass unto 
the vine, and his ass's colt unto the choice vine; he hath washed his garments in wine, and his vesture in the blood of grapes (Gen. 49:11); </p>
<p>this is the prophecy of Jacob, at that time Israel, concerning 
the Lord; the "vine" and the "choice vine" denote the spiritual church external and internal (n. 1069); the "young ass" denotes natural truth; the "ass's colt" rational truth. The reason an "ass's 
colt" denotes rational truth is that a "she-ass" signifies the affection of natural truth (n. 1486), the son of which is rational truth, as may be seen above (n. 1895, 1896, 1902, 1910).  [6] In old 
times a judge rode upon a she-ass, and his sons upon young asses; for the reason that the judges represented the goods of the church, and their sons the truths thence derived. But a king rode upon a 
she-mule, and his sons upon mules, by reason that kings and their sons represented the truths of the church (see n. 1672, 1728, 2015, 2069). That a judge rode upon a she-ass is evident in the book of 
Judges: </p>
<p>      My heart is toward the lawgivers of Israel, that offered themselves willingly among the people; bless ye Jehovah, ye that ride upon white she-asses, ye that sit upon carpets (Judg. 5:9-10). That 
the sons of the judges rode upon young asses: </p>
<p>     Jair the judge over Israel had thirty sons, that rode on thirty young asses (Judges 10:3-4, and in other places).       Abdon the judge 
of Israel had forty sons, and thirty sons' sons, that rode on seventy young asses (Judges 12:14). That a king rode upon a she-mule: </p>
<p>     David said unto them, Take with you the servants of your lord, 
and cause Solomon my son to ride upon the she-mule which is mine. And they caused Solomon to ride upon king David's she-mule, and Zadok the priest and Nathan the prophet anointed him king in Gihon 
(1 Kings 1:33, 38, 44-45). That the sons of a king rode upon he-mules: </p>
<p>     All the sons of king David rose up, and rode each one upon his mule, and fled, because of Absalom (2 Sam. 13:29). [7] Hence 
it is manifest that to ride on a she-ass was the badge of a judge, and to ride on a she-mule, the badge of a king; and that to ride on a young ass was the badge of a judge's sons, and to ride on a 
mule was the badge of a king's sons; for the reason as already said that a she-ass represented and signified the affection of natural good and truth, a she-mule the affection of rational truth, an ass 
or a young ass natural truth itself, and a mule and also the son of a she-ass rational truth. Hence it is plain what is meant by the prophecy concerning the Lord in Zechariah: </p>
<p>    Rejoice, O daughter 
of Zion; shout, O daughter of Jerusalem; behold, thy King cometh unto thee. He is just and having salvation, lowly and riding upon an ass, and upon a young ass the son of she-asses. His dominion shall 
be from sea to sea, and from the river to the ends of the earth (Zech. 9:9-10). That the Lord, when He came to Jerusalem, willed to ride upon these animals, is known from the Evangelists, as in Matthew: </p>
<p> 
    Jesus sent two disciples, saying unto them, Go into the village that is over against you, and straightway ye shall find a she-ass tied, and a colt with her; loose them, and bring them unto 
Me. This was done that it might be fulfilled which was spoken by the prophet, saying, Tell ye the daughter of Zion, Behold thy King cometh unto thee, meek, sitting upon a she-ass, and upon a colt the 
son of a beast of burden. And they brought the she-ass and the colt, and put their garments upon them, and set Him thereon (Matt. 21:1-2, 4-5, 7). [8] To "ride upon an ass" was a sign that the natural 
was made subordinate; and to "ride upon a colt the son of a she-ass" was a sign that the rational was made subordinate. (That the "son of a she-ass" signified the same as a "mule" has been shown above 
at the passage from Gen. 49:11.) From this their signification, and because it belonged to the highest judge and to a king to ride upon them, and at the same time that the representatives of the 
church might be fulfilled, it pleased the Lord to do this: as is thus described in John: </p>
<p>    On the next day a great multitude that had come to the feast, when they heard that Jesus was coming to Jerusalem, 
took branches of palm trees, and went forth to meet Him, and cried, Hosanna, Blessed is He that cometh in the name of the Lord, even the King of Israel. And Jesus, having found a young ass, sat 
thereon; as it is written, Fear not, daughter of Zion; behold thy King cometh sitting on the colt of a she-ass. These things understood not His disciples at the first; but when Jesus was glorified, 
then remembered they that these things were written of Him, and that they had done these things unto Him (John 12:12-16; Mark 11:1-12; Luke 19:28-41). [9] From all this it is now evident that all and 
everything in the church of that period was representative of the Lord, and therefore of the celestial and spiritual things that are in His kingdom-even to the she-ass and the colt of a she-ass, by which 
the natural man as to good and truth was represented. The reason of the representation was that the natural man ought to serve the rational, and this the spiritual, this the celestial, and this the 
Lord: such is the order of subordination.  [10] Since by an "ox and an ass" the natural man as to good and truth is signified, many laws were therefore given in which oxen and asses are mentioned, 
which laws at first sight do not appear to be worthy of mention in the Divine Word; but when unfolded as to their internal sense, the spiritual meaning in them appears to be of great moment-as the following 
in Moses: </p>
<p>     If a man shall open a pit, or if a man shall dig a pit, and not cover it, and an ox or an ass fall into it, the owner of the pit shall give money to the owner, and the dead shall 
be his (Exod. 21:33-34).      If thou meet thine enemy's ox or his ass going astray, thou shalt surely bring it back to him again. If thou see the ass of him that hateth thee lying under his burden, 
and wouldest forbear to remove it, removing thou shalt remove it from him (Exod. 23:4-5; Deut. 22:1, 3).      Thou shalt not see thy brother's ass or his ox falling down in the way, and hide thyself 
from them; lifting thou shalt lift them up again (Deut. 22:4).      Thou shalt not plow with an ox and an ass together. Thou shalt not wear a mixed web of wool and linen together (Deut. 22:10-11).  
    Six days thou shalt do thy works, and on the seventh day thou shalt rest, that thine ox and thine ass may rest also, and the son of thy handmaid, and the sojourner (Exod. 23:12).      Here the 
"ox and ass" signify nothing else in the spiritual sense than natural good and truth. * Tigris; but leo vetus, n. 3048. [Rotch ed.] </p>

'And saddled [his] ass' means the natural man which He prepared. This is clear from the meaning of 'an ass', dealt with below. In man there are things of the will and there are those of the understanding; 
with the former go those things which spring from good, with the latter those which spring from truth. There are various kinds of animals, by which things of the will springing from good are meant, 
such as lambs, sheep, goats, she- goats, young bulls, and oxen, see <a href="1823.htm">1823</a>, <a href="2179.htm">2179</a>, <a href="2180.htm">2180</a>; and there are also those by which are meant things of the understanding springing from truth, namely horses, mules, 
wild asses, camels, and asses, in addition to birds. 'A horse' means the understanding part of the mind, as has been shown above in <a href="2761.htm">2761</a>, <a href="2762.htm">2762</a>; ' a wild ass' means rational truth separated from 
good, see <a href="1949.htm">1949</a>; and 'a camel' means factual knowledge in general, and 'an ass' factual knowledge in particular, see <a href="1486.htm">1486</a>. </p>
<p></p>
<p><b>[2]</b>
 There are two elements which constitute the natural degree of man's mind, 
or what amounts to the same, the natural man - natural good and natural truth. Natural good is the delight that flows forth from charity and faith, natural truth is knowledge of these. That natural 
truth is what is meant by 'an ass', and rational truth by 'a mule', becomes clear from the following places: In Isaiah, </p>
<blockquote>
A prophecy of the beasts of the south. In the land of distress and repression 
are the lion and the tiger, and from them come the viper and the flying fiery-serpent. They will bear their riches on the shoulders of young asses, and their treasures on the humps of camels - on a 
people [who] will not be any use [to them]; for the Egyptians will help in vain and to no advantage. <a href="http://bible.gospelcom.net/cgi-bin/bible?passage=Isa%2030:%206,%207&amp;version=ESV&amp;interface=print&amp;showfn=yes&amp;showxref">Isa 30: 6, 7</a>. 
</blockquote>
<p>The expression 'the beasts of the south' is used of those who possess cognitions 
of good and truth but who make them matters of knowledge, not of life. In reference to those beasts it is said that those people 'bear their riches on the shoulders of young asses, and their treasures 
on the humps of camels', for the reason that 'young asses' means facts in particular, and 'camels' facts in general. 'The Egyptians', of whom it is said that they will help in vain and to no advantage, 
means knowledge, see <a href="1164.htm">1164</a>, <a href="1165.htm">1165</a>, <a href="1186.htm">1186</a>. It is evident to anyone that this prophecy has an internal sense and that without this it is understood by nobody, for without the internal sense no one can know 
what 'the prophecy of the beasts of the south' is, or what 'the lion and the tiger', or what 'the viper and the flying fiery-serpent', or what is meant by the words that 'those beasts were to bear 
their riches on the shoulders of young asses, and their treasures on the humps of camels', or why the assertion immediately follows that 'the Egyptians will help in vain and to no advantage'. 'Ass' is 
used with a like meaning in Israel's prophecy concerning Issachar, in Moses, </p>
<blockquote>
Issachar is a bony ass lying down between burdens. <a href="http://bible.gospelcom.net/cgi-bin/bible?passage=Gen%2049:%2014&amp;version=ESV&amp;interface=print&amp;showfn=yes&amp;showxref">Gen 49: 14</a>. 
</blockquote>
<p></p>
<p><b>[3]</b>
 In Zechariah, </p>
<blockquote>
This will be the plague with which 
Jehovah will smite all the peoples that wage war against Jerusalem. It will be a plague of the horse, the mule, the camel, and the ass, and every beast. <a href="http://bible.gospelcom.net/cgi-bin/bible?passage=Zech%2014:%2012,%2015&amp;version=ESV&amp;interface=print&amp;showfn=yes&amp;showxref">Zech 14: 12, 15</a>. 
</blockquote>
<p>'The horse, the mule, 
the camel, and the ass' means things of the understanding residing in man which will suffer from the plague. This is clear from every single detail before and after those verses, for the subject there 
is the plagues which are to precede the Last Judgement or. Close of the Age and to which John makes much reference in Revelation, as do the rest of the Prophets in various places. Those who are going 
to wage war at that time against Jerusalem, that is, against the Lord's spiritual Church and its truths, are meant by those animals. It will be the things of the understanding that will suffer from 
such plagues </p>
<p></p>
<p><b>[4]</b>
 In Isaiah, </p>
<blockquote>
Blessed are you who sow beside all waters, who send forth the foot of the ox and the ass. <a href="http://bible.gospelcom.net/cgi-bin/bible?passage=Isa%2032:%2020&amp;version=ESV&amp;interface=print&amp;showfn=yes&amp;showxref">Isa 32: 20</a>. 
</blockquote>
<p>'Sowing beside all waters' stands for those who allow themselves 
to be taught spiritual things - 'waters' meaning spiritual things and so things that constitute an understanding of truth, see <a href="680.htm">680</a>, <a href="739.htm">739</a>, <a href="2702.htm">2702</a>. 'Who send forth the foot of the ox and the ass' stands 
for natural things that are to be of service, 'ox' meaning the natural as regards good, <a href="2180.htm">2180</a>, <a href="2566.htm">2566</a>, 'ass' the natural as regards truth. </p>
<p></p>
<p><b>[5]</b>
 In Moses, </p>
<blockquote>
Binding his young ass to the vine and the 
foal<A name="fntext1"></a><A href="#fn1"><sup>a</sup></a> of his she-ass to the choice vine. He washes his vesture in wine and his cloak in the blood of grapes. <a href="http://bible.gospelcom.net/cgi-bin/bible?passage=Gen%2049:%2011&amp;version=ESV&amp;interface=print&amp;showfn=yes&amp;showxref">Gen 49: 11</a>. 
</blockquote>
<p>This is the prophecy of Jacob, by then Israel, concerning the Lord. 'The vine' 
and 'the choice vine' stand for the spiritual Church, external and internal, <a href="1069.htm">1069</a>. 'Young ass' stands for natural truth, 'the foal of a she-ass' for rational truth. The reason 'the foal of a she-ass' 
means rational truth is that 'a she ass' means the affection for natural truth, <a href="1486.htm">1486</a>, while her foal means rational truth, see <a href="1895.htm">1895</a>, <a href="1896.htm">1896</a>, <a href="1902.htm">1902</a>, <a href="1910.htm">1910</a>. </p>
<p></p>
<p><b>[6]</b>
 In former times a judge used to ride 
on a she-ass and his sons on young asses, the reason being that judges represented the goods of the Church and their sons truths derived from those goods. A king however used to ride on a she-mule and 
his sons on mules, the reason being that kings and their sons represented the truths of the Church, see <a href="1672.htm">1672</a>, <a href="1728.htm">1728</a>, <a href="2015.htm">2015</a>, <a href="2069.htm">2069</a>. The fact that a judge rode on a she-ass is clear in the Book of Judges, </p>
<blockquote>
My 
heart goes out to the law-givers of Israel offering themselves willingly among the people. Bless Jehovah, you who ride on white she-asses, you who sit on Middin.<A name="fntext2"></a><A href="#fn2"><sup>b</sup></a> <a href="http://bible.gospelcom.net/cgi-bin/bible?passage=Judg%205:%209,%2010&amp;version=ESV&amp;interface=print&amp;showfn=yes&amp;showxref">Judg 5: 9, 10</a>. 
</blockquote>
<p>The fact that 
judges' sons rode on young asses, </p>
<blockquote>
Jair the judge over Israel had thirty sons who rode on thirty young asses. <a href="http://bible.gospelcom.net/cgi-bin/bible?passage=Judg%2010:%203,%204&amp;version=ESV&amp;interface=print&amp;showfn=yes&amp;showxref">Judg 10: 3, 4</a>. 
</blockquote>
<p>And elsewhere in the same book, </p>
<blockquote>
Abdon the judge of Israel had 
forty sons and thirty grandsons who rode on seventy young asses. <a href="http://bible.gospelcom.net/cgi-bin/bible?passage=Judg%2012:%2014&amp;version=ESV&amp;interface=print&amp;showfn=yes&amp;showxref">Judg 12: 14</a>. 
</blockquote>
<p>David said to them, Take with you the servants of your lord and cause Solomon my son to ride on the she-mule which is 
mine. And they caused Solomon to ride on King David's she-mule. And Zadok the priest and Nathan the prophet anointed him king in Gihon. <a href="1.htm">1</a> Kings 1: <a href="33.htm">33</a>, <a href="38.htm">38</a>, <a href="44.htm">44</a>, <a href="45.htm">45</a>. </p>
<p>The fact that the king's sons rode 
on mules, </p>
<p>All King David's sons arose, and they rode each on his mule and fled because of Absalom. <a href="2.htm">2</a> Sam. 13: <a href="29.htm">29</a>. </p>
<p></p>
<p><b>[7]</b>
 From all this it is evident that riding on a she-ass indicated the judge, and 
riding on a she-mule the king; riding on a young ass indicated the judge's sons, and doing so on a mule the king's sons. They indicated these personages because, as has been stated, 'a she-ass' represented 
and meant the affection for natural good and truth, 'a she-mule' the affection for rational truth, 'an ass or young ass' natural truth itself, and 'a mule' as well as 'the foal of a she-ass' 
rational truth. This shows what is meant by the prophetical words that refer to the Lord, in Zechariah, </p>
<p>Exult, O daughter of Zion! Rejoice, O daughter of Jerusalem! Behold, your King will come to you. 
He is just and having salvation, humble and riding on an ass, and on a young ass, the foal of she-asses. His dominion will be from sea to sea, and from the River to the ends of the earth. Zech. 9: <a href="9.htm">9</a>, <a href="10.htm">10</a>. </p>
<p>The fact that the Lord wished to ride on these when He was about to enter Jerusalem is well known from the Gospels. The event is referred to in Matthew as follows, </p>
<p>Jesus sent two disciples, 
saying to them, Go into the village opposite you, and immediately you will find a she-ass tied, and a colt with her; untie them and bring them to Me. This took place to fulfil what was spoken by the 
prophet saying, Tell the daughter of Zion, Behold, your King is coming to you, meek seated on a she-ass, and on a colt, the foal of a beast of burden. And they brought the she-ass and the colt and 
laid their garments on them and set Him on them. Matt. 21: <a href="2.htm">2</a>, <a href="4.htm">4</a>, <a href="5.htm">5</a>, <a href="7.htm">7</a>. </p>
<p></p>
<p><b>[8]</b>
 'Riding on an ass' served to indicate that the natural was subordinate, and 'riding on a colt, the foal of a she-ass' that 
the rational was so; for 'the foal of a she-ass' is similar in meaning to 'a mule', as has been shown above, where Gen. 49: <a href="11.htm">11</a> is referred to.<A name="fntext3"></a><A href="#fn3"><sup>c</sup></a> From this - the spiritual meaning of these animals- and 
because it was the right of the supreme judge and of the king to ride on them, and at the same time so that He might fulfil the representatives of the Church, the Lord was pleased to ride in this way. 
His doing so is described in John as follows, </p>
<p>The next day a great crowd who had come to the feast, when they heard that Jesus was coming to Jerusalem, took branches of palm trees, and went to 
meet Him, and cried, Hosanna! Blessed is He who comes in the name of the Lord, even the King of Israel! Jesus found a young ass and sat on it, as it is written, Fear not, daughter of Zion; behold, your 
King is coming, sitting on a she-ass's colt! These things however His disciples had not understood at first, but when Jesus was glorified, then they remembered that these things had been written of 
Him, and that they had done these things for Him. John 12: <a href="12.htm">12</a>-<a href="16.htm">16</a>; Mark 11: <a href="1.htm">1</a>-<a href="12.htm">12</a>; Luke 19: <a href="28.htm">28</a>-<a href="41.htm">41</a>. </p>
<p></p>
<p><b>[9]</b>
 From an this it may now be clear that every single thing in the Church of that period was representative 
of the Lord, and consequently of the celestial and spiritual things that are in His kingdom; even the she-ass and the colt of the she-ass were so, which represented the natural man as regards 
good and truth. The reason for the representation was that the natural man ought to serve the rational, and the rational to serve the spiritual; but the spiritual ought to serve the celestial, and the 
celestial to serve the Lord. This is the order in which one is subordinated to another. </p>
<p></p>
<p><b>[10]</b>
 Because 'an ox and an ass' meant the natural man as regards good and truth many laws were therefore laid 
down in which oxen and asses are mentioned. At first glance these laws do not seem to be worthy of mention in the Divine Word, but when they are interpreted as to their internal sense, that which is 
spiritual and of great importance is seen within these laws, such as the following laws in Moses, </p>
<p>If anyone opens a pit, or if anyone digs a pit and does not cover it, and an ox or an ass falls into 
it, the owner of the pit shall recompense its owner with silver, and the dead animal shall be his. Exod. 21: <a href="33.htm">33</a>, <a href="34.htm">34</a>. If you meet your enemy's ox or his ass going astray you shall certainly lead it 
back to him. If you see the ass of one who hates you Lying under its burden, and you are disinclined to remove it, you shall certainly help to remove it from it. Exod. 23: <a href="4.htm">4</a>, <a href="5.htm">5</a>; Deut. 22: <a href="1.htm">1</a>, <a href="3.htm">3</a>. You 
shall not see your brother's ass or ox falling down in the road and hide yourself from them; you shall certainly help to lift them. Deut. 22: <a href="4.htm">4</a>. You shall not plough with an ox and an ass together. 
You shall not wear mingled material made of wool and linen together. Deut. 22: <a href="10.htm">10</a>, <a href="11.htm">11</a>. Six days you shall do your works, and on the seventh day you shall rest, in order that your ox and your ass may 
rest, and the son of your woman servant, and the settler. Exod. 23: <a href="12.htm">12</a>. </p>
<p>Here 'ox and ass' in the spiritual sense means nothing other than natural good and truth.

quod `illae bestiae ferrent super humero asellorum facultates suas, et super gibbo camelorum thesauros suos,' et cur immediate sequitur, quod `Aegyptii vane et inaniter auxiliabuntur': simile per `asinum'

filiis regis, ex causa, ut dictum, quia `asina' repraesentabat et significabat affectionem boni et veri naturalis,`mula' affectionem veri rationalis, `asinus seu asellus' ipsum verum naturale, et 
`mulus' ut et `filius asinae' verum rationale: inde patet quid intelligitur per prophetica de Domino, apud Zachariam,      Exsulta filia Zionis, jubila filia Hierosolymae, ecce Rex tuus veniet tibi justus 
et salvatus ille, humilis et equitans super asino, et super asello filio asinarum; dominium Ipsius a mari usque ad mare, et a fluvio usque ad fines terrae, ix 9, 10; </p>
<p>quod Dominus voluit, cum ad 
Hierosolymam veniret, equitare super illis, notum est apud Evangelistas, de quo ita apud Matthaeum,      Jesus misit duos discipulos, dicens illis, Abite in villam      quae contra vos, et statim invenietis 
asinam alligatam, et      pullum cum ea, solvite et adducite Mihi: . . . hoc factum ut      impleretur quod  dictum est per prophetam dicentem, Dicite      filiae Zionis, ecce Rex tuus venit 
tibi mansuetus, sedens      super asina, et super pullo filio subjugalis; . . . et      adduxerunt asinam et pullum, et  imposuerunt super eis      vestimenta sua, et collocarunt Ipsum super illis, 
xxi 2, 4, 7; </p>
<p>[8] `equitare super asino' insigne erat quod subordinatum esset naturale, et `equitare super pullo filio asinae,' quod subordinatum esset rationale; quod `filius asinae' simile ac `mulus' 
significet, supra ad locum Gen. xlix 11 ostensum est; inde, et quia summi judicis et regis erat super illis equitare, utque simul repraesentativa Ecclesiae implerentur, placuit hoc Domino; de hoc 
ita apud Johannem,      Postero die multa turba, quae venerat ad festum, cum      audivisset quod veniret Jesus Hierosolymam, acceperunt ramos       palmarum, et iverunt obviam Ipsi, et clamaverunt, 
Osanna,      benedictus qui venit in nomine Domini, Rex Israelis: inveniens      autem Jesus asellum, sedit super eum; sicut scriptum est, Ne      time filia Zionis, ecce Rex tuus venit sedens 
super pullo      asinae: haec vero non cognoverant discipuli Ipsius primum, sed      quando glorificatus est Jesus, tunc recordati sunt quod haec      essent de Ipso scripta, et haec fecissent Ipsi, 
xii 12-16; </p>
<p>     Marc. xi 1-12;  Luc. xix 28-41. [9] Ex his nunc {4}constet quod omnia et singula in Ecclesia {5}illius temporis fuerint repraesentativa Domini, et inde caelestium et spiritualium 
quae in regno Ipsius, et hoc usque ad asinam et asinae pullum, per quos repraesentabatur naturalis homo quoad bonum et verum; causa repraesentationis fuit quod naturalis homo servire debeat rationali, 
et hic spirituali, hic autem caelesti, et hic Domino; talis ordo subordinationis est. [10] Quia per `bovem et asinum' significabatur naturalis homo quoad bonum et verum, ideo plures leges latae sunt, 
in quibus boves et asini memorantur, quae leges primo aspectu apparent non dignae memoratu in Verbo Divino; at cum evolvuntur quoad sensum internum, apparet spirituale multi momenti, quod inibi; sicut 
hae apud Mosen,      Cum aperuerit quis foveam, vel cum foderit quis foveam, et non      operuerit eam, et ceciderit illuc bos vel asinus, dominus      foveae rependet argentum domino, et mortuum 
erit sibi, Exod.      xxi 33, 34: </p>
<p>     Cum occurreris bovi inimici tui, vel asino ejus erranti,      reducendo reduces eum illi: cum videris asinum osoris tui       cubantem sub onere suo, et cessaveris 
a removendo illud, et       removendo removebis ab illo, Exod. xxiii 4, 5; Deut. xxii 1,      3:       Non videbis asinum fratris tui vel bovem, cadentes in via,  et      abscondis te ab illis, 
erigendo eriges, Deut. xxii 4:       Non arabis bove et asino pariter; non vestias te textura mixta      lana et lino simul, Deut. xxii 10, 11: </p>
<p>     Sex diebus facies opera tua, et in die septimo 
quiesces,       propterea {6}ut requiescat bos tuus, et asinus tuus, et filius      ancillae tuae, et peregrinus, Exod. xxiii 12; </p>
