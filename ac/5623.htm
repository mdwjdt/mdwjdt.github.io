<h3 align="center" class="ired">属天的奥秘 第5623节</h3>
<h4 align="center"></h4><p><strong>5623.</strong>“又要手里加倍地带银子”表凭能力所得的真理。这从“银子”、“加倍”和“手”的含义清楚可知：“银子”是指真理（参看<a href="1551.htm">1551</a>，<a href="2954.htm">2954</a>节）；“加倍”是指连续地第二次（参看<a href="1335.htm">1335</a>节），也就是说，已白白赐予他们的真理将再次白白赐予他们；“手”是指能力（<a href="878.htm">878</a>，<a href="3387.htm">3387</a>，<a href="4931.htm">4931</a>-<a href="4937.htm">4937</a>，<a href="5327.htm">5327</a>，<a href="5328.htm">5328</a>节）。存在于能力中的真理是在里面，因而在人们接受它的能力范围内的真理。但人们接受真理的能力或才能完全取决于良善，因为主将他们与良善联结。事实上，当主带着良善流入时，祂也带着那种能力流入。因此，凭人的能力对真理的接受取决于良善。人接受真理的能力取决于良善，这一事实从来世的大量经历明显看出来。<br />在来世，那些处于良善的人不仅拥有觉知真理的能力，还有接受它的能力；然而，这取决于他们所在良善的量和质。而另一方面，那些陷入邪恶的人没有接受真理的任何能力。前者接受真理的能力和后者不接受真理的能力都是各人的快乐和随之渴望的结果。那些处于良善之人的快乐在于通过真理实现良善，因为其良善从真理取得自己的品质；因此，他们也渴望这些真理。但那些陷入邪恶之人的快乐在于邪恶，在于利用虚假为邪恶辩解；因此，他们渴望虚假；他们因渴望虚假，故厌恶真理。因此，他们没有接受真理的能力，因为真理一传到那些陷入邪恶之人的耳朵里，或进入他们的脑海，他们要么抛弃、要么窒息、要么歪曲这些真理。此外，凡心智健全的人都有接受真理的能力；但那些转向邪恶的人却毁灭了这种能力，而那些转向良善的人则增强了这种能力。</p>

And take double silver in your hands. That this signifies truth received in the abilities, is evident from the signification of "silver," as being truth (see n. 1551, 2954); and from the signification 
of "double," as being again in succession (see n. 1335), namely truth which was gratuitously bestowed on them, and which was to be bestowed on them again; and from the signification of "hands," as being 
abilities (n. 878, 3387, 4931-4937, 5327, 5328). Truth in the abilities means in the capacities for receiving it, thus according to the capacities. But the capacities or abilities for receiving truth 
are wholly according to good, because the Lord adjoins them to good; for when the Lord flows in with good He also flows in with capacity. Hence truth received in the abilities means according to 
goods. That the capacities for receiving truth are according to good is evident from much experience in the other life. They who are in good there have the capacity not only for perceiving truth, but 
also for receiving it, yet according to the amount and quality of the good in which they are. But they who are in evil have on the other hand no capacity for receiving truth. This comes from pleasure 
and consequent desire. They who are in good have pleasure in perfecting good by means of truth, because good takes its quality from truths; and therefore they desire truths. But they who are in evil have 
pleasure in evil, and in confirming it by falsities, and therefore they desire falsities; and because they desire falsities they are averse to truths. For this reason they have no capacity for receiving 
truths, for they reject or stifle or pervert them as soon as they reach the ear or occur to the thought. Besides, every man who is of sound mind has a capacity for receiving truths; but they extinguish 
this capacity who turn to evil, and they exalt it who turn to good. </p>

<p align="center"><b>Elliott(1983-1999) 5623</b></p><p><b>5623.</b>
'And take a double amount of silver in your hands' means truth received by the powers. This is clear from the meaning of 'silver' as truth, dealt with in <a href="1551.htm">1551</a>, <a href="2954.htm">2954</a>; from the meaning of 'a double amount' 
as in succession, a second time, dealt with in <a href="1335.htm">1335</a>, that is to say, it was truth which had been given to them freely, and was to be given once again; and from the meaning of 'hands' as powers, dealt 
with in <a href="878.htm">878</a>, <a href="3387.htm">3387</a>, <a href="4931.htm">4931</a>-<a href="4937.htm">4937</a>, <a href="5327.htm">5327</a>, <a href="5328.htm">5328</a>. Truth present in the powers is truth within, thus subject to, people's abilities to accept it. But people's abilities or powers to accept truth are utterly 
dependent on good. They are linked by the Lord to good. For when the Lord enters with good He also enters with that kind of ability. Consequently the reception of truth by a person's powers is dependent 
on what forms of good are present. The fact that people's abilities to accept truth are determined by the good that is present becomes clear from much experience in the next life. </p>
<p></p>
<p><b>[2]</b>
 Those there 
who are moved by good have not only the ability to perceive truth but also the ability to accept it; yet this is conditioned by the amount and the kind of good that moves them. Those on the other 
hand who are moved by evil do not have any ability to accept truth. That ability of the former and this inability of the latter to accept truth are the outcome of each one's pleasure and consequent desire. 
The pleasure of those moved by good consists in the accomplishing of what is good by means of truth; for the specific nature of their good is derived from truths, and therefore they also have a 
desire for those truths. But the pleasure of those moved by evil consists in evil and the justification of it by the use of falsities, which they also consequently have a desire for; and in their desire 
for falsities they turn away from truths. Consequently, having no ability to accept truths, those moved by evil therefore cast these aside, or smother them, or pervert them as soon as they reach their 
ears or enter their heads. Furthermore every individual person of sound mind has the ability to accept truths; but those who turn to evil annihilate that ability, whereas those who turn to good enhance it. </p>

`Et argenti duplum accipite in manibus vestris':  quod significet verum acceptum in potentiis, constat (c)a significatione argenti quod sit verum, de qua n. 1551, 2954; (c)a significatione `dupli' quod 
sit successive alterum, De qua n. 1335, nempe verum quo gratis donati, et quo rursus donandi; et (c)a significatione `manuum' quod sint potentiae, de qua n. 878, 3387, 4931-4937, 5327, 5328. Verum 
in potentiis est in facultatibus recipiendi ita secundum facultates, at facultates seu potentiae recipiendi verum se habent prorsus secundum bonum, nam illos Dominus adjungit bono; cum enim Dominus influit 
cum bono, etiam influit cum facultate; inde verum acceptum in potentiis est secundum bona; quod facultates recipiendi verum se habeant secundum bonum, constare potest a multa experientia in altera 
vita; [2] qui ibi in bono sunt, illi habent non modo facultatem  percipiendi verum sed etiam recipiendi, at secundum quantum boni et quale boni in quo sunt; qui autem in malo sunt, illi vicissim nullam 
facultatem recipiendi verum habent; hoc venit ex volupi et inde desiderio; qui in bono sunt, illis volupe est bonum perficere per verum, nam bonum suum quale accipit a veris, quare etiam desiderant 
vera; at qui in malo sunt, illis volupe est malum, et hoc per falsa confirmare; quare etiam desiderant falsa; et quia desiderant falsa, aversantur vera; inde est quod illis nulla facultas recipiendi 
vera, rejiciunt enim, vel suffocant, vel pervertunt illa ut primum ad aurem aut in cogitationem veniunt.  Praeterea unusquisque homo qui sanae mentis est, in facultate est recipiendi vera, sed facultatem 
illam exstinguunt illi qui ad malum se convertunt, at facultatem illam elevant illi qui ad bonum. </p>
