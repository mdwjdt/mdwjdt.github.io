<h3 align="center" class="ired">属天的奥秘 第5319节</h3>
<h4 align="center"></h4><p><strong>5319.</strong>“给他穿上细麻衣”表一个外在标志，表示属灵层的属天层，“细麻衣”是指从神性发出的真理。这从“衣”的含义清楚可知，“衣”是指真理（参看<a href="1073.htm">1073</a>，<a href="2576.htm">2576</a>，<a href="4545.htm">4545</a>，<a href="4763.htm">4763</a>，<a href="5248.htm">5248</a>节）。“细麻衣”之所以指从神性发出的真理，是因为由细麻制成的衣服绝对纯白，同时又闪闪发光；从神性发出的真理就由这种洁白光亮的衣服来代表。原因在于，天堂的亮白和光辉就来自从主所流出的光，这光就是神性真理本身（<a href="1053.htm">1053</a>，<a href="1521.htm">1521</a>-<a href="1533.htm">1533</a>，<a href="1619.htm">1619</a>-<a href="1632.htm">1632</a>，<a href="2776.htm">2776</a>，<a href="3195.htm">3195</a>，<a href="3222.htm">3222</a>，<a href="3339.htm">3339</a>，<a href="3485.htm">3485</a>，<a href="3636.htm">3636</a>，<a href="3643.htm">3643</a>，<a href="3862.htm">3862</a>，<a href="4415.htm">4415</a>，<a href="4419.htm">4419</a>，<a href="4526.htm">4526</a>，<a href="5219.htm">5219</a>节）。这解释了为何当主在彼得、雅各和约翰面前变形像时，祂的衣裳洁白如“光”（马太福音<a href="http://39-27.cn/太17.2.htm">17:2</a>）；“衣服放光，极其洁白，地上漂布的，没有一个能漂得那样白”（马可福音<a href="http://39-27.cn/可9.3.htm">9:3</a>）；“衣服洁白放光”（路加福音<a href="http://39-27.cn/路9.29.htm">9:29</a>）。以这种方式所代表的，正是从主的神性人身发出的神性真理本身。然而，衣服的亮白代表的是外层真理，而脸上的明亮和光辉代表的是内层事物。这就是为何“给他穿上细麻衣”在此是指一个外在标志，表示从属灵层的属天层发出的真理，因为这就是那时构成主之神性的东西。<br />在圣言的其它地方，“细麻”和“细麻衣”也表示从神性发出的真理，如以西结书：<br />我也使你身穿刺绣的衣服，脚穿海狗皮鞋，并用细麻给你束腰，用丝绸为衣披在你身上。这样，你就有金银的妆饰，你的衣服是细麻和丝绸并刺绣的。（以西结书<a href="http://39-27.cn/结16.10.htm">16:10</a>，<a href="http://39-27.cn/结16.13.htm">13</a>）<br />这论及耶路撒冷，在这几节里，耶路撒冷表示古教会。“细麻和丝绸并刺绣的衣服”，以及“金银的妆饰”描述了该教会的真理。“刺绣”表示作为记忆知识存在的真理；“细麻”表示属世真理；“丝绸”表示属灵真理。<br /><br />你的篷帆是用埃及刺绣的细麻布做的，可以作你的大旗；你的凉棚是用以利沙岛的蓝色、紫色布做的。（以西结书<a href="http://39-27.cn/结27.7.htm">27:7</a>）<br />这论及推罗，推罗也表示古教会，不过表示在良善与真理的知识方面的古教会；“它的篷帆是用埃及刺绣的细麻布做的”表示从作为该教会外在标志的记忆知识那里所获得的真理。<br />启示录：<br />地上的客商也都为巴比伦哭泣悲哀，因为没有人再买他们的货物了。这货物就是金，银，宝石，珍珠，细麻布，紫色料，绸子，各样象牙的器皿，各样极宝贵的木头和铜，铁，大理石的器皿。（启示录<a href="http://39-27.cn/启18.11.htm">18:11</a>-<a href="http://39-27.cn/启18.12.htm">12</a>）<br />这段经文所提到的所有具体物品皆表示诸如与教会有关，因而与真理并良善有关的那类事物；但此处因论及巴比伦，故是从反面意义上来说的。谁都能看出，若非每种事物里面含有某种天上的事物，从天上降下来的圣言永远不会列举这类事物；因为在论述表示一个亵渎教会的巴比伦时，为何要提及世俗物品呢？<br /><br />祸哉，祸哉，这大城阿，素常穿着细麻，紫色，朱红色，嵌有金子，宝石，和珍珠的衣服。（启示录<a href="http://39-27.cn/启18.16.htm">18:16</a>）<br />此处每个细节都表示某种天上的神性事物，这一事实明显可见于启示录中论到细麻衣的地方，即“细麻衣”就是“圣徒的义行”：<br />羔羊的婚期到了，祂的妻子也自己预备好了。并且得赏赐，可以披上明亮洁净的细麻衣；这细麻衣就是圣徒的义行。（启示录<a href="http://39-27.cn/启19.7.htm">19:7</a>-<a href="http://39-27.cn/启19.8.htm">8</a>）<br />“细麻衣就是圣徒的义行”，这是因为凡处于从神性所得来的真理之人都披上主的公义；事实上，他们的衣服因从主流出的光而洁白发光。因此，在天堂，“亮白”代表真理本身（<a href="3301.htm">3301</a>，<a href="3993.htm">3993</a>，<a href="4007.htm">4007</a>节）。也正因如此，从消磨的状态被提升到天堂的人看似穿着亮白的衣服，因为那时他们脱下自己公义的袍子，披上了主公义的袍子。<br />为叫来自神性的真理能在犹太教会被代表，他们被吩咐用绵布或细麻布作亚伦的圣衣，以及约柜周围的幔子，如我们在摩西五经中所读到的：<br />你要杂色细麻线织内袍，用细麻布作冠冕。（出埃及记<a href="http://39-27.cn/出28.39.htm">28:39</a>）<br />他们用织成的细麻布为亚伦和他的儿子作内袍。（出埃及记<a href="http://39-27.cn/出39.27.htm">39:27</a>）<br />你要用十幅幔子作帐幕。这些幔子要用捻的细麻和蓝色、紫色、朱红色线制造。（出埃及记<a href="http://39-27.cn/出26.1.htm">26:1</a>；<a href="http://39-27.cn/出36.8.htm">36:8</a>）<br />你要作帐幕的院子，要用捻的细麻作院子的帷子。（出埃及记<a href="http://39-27.cn/出27.9.htm">27:9</a>，<a href="http://39-27.cn/出27.18.htm">18</a>；<a href="http://39-27.cn/出38.9.htm">38:9</a>）<br />院子的门帘是以绣花的手工，用蓝色、紫色、朱红色线和捻的细麻织的。（出埃及记<a href="http://39-27.cn/出38.18.htm">38:18</a>）<br />之所以要用细麻，是因为约柜及其周围的一切事物，以及亚伦圣衣上的一切事物都是属灵和属天事物的代表。这表明人若不知道这类事物代表什么，对圣言的理解少得可怜；若以为除了字面上的东西外，圣言再无其它神圣，则几乎不理解。<br />处于来自神性的真理的天使看似穿着细麻衣，也就是亮白的衣服，这从启示录中提及“白马”的地方明显看出来：<br />骑在白马上的穿着溅了血的衣服，祂的名称为神之道。在天上的众军骑着白马，穿着细麻衣，又白又洁，跟随祂。（启示录<a href="http://39-27.cn/启19.13.htm">19:13</a>-<a href="http://39-27.cn/启19.14.htm">14</a>）<br />这些话清清楚楚表明，“细麻衣”是从神性发出的真理的一个外在标志；因为“骑在白马上的”是指圣言方面的主；事实上，这些话明确说明祂就是圣言。圣言就是从神性所得来的真理，“白马”是指圣言的内义（参看<a href="2760.htm">2760</a>-<a href="2762.htm">2762</a>节）。因此，“白马”是指从神性所得来的真理，因为这类真理构成圣言的整个内义。这就为何会看到祂的众军“骑着白马，穿着细麻衣，又白又洁”。</p>

And clothed him in garments of fine linen. That this signifies an external significative of the celestial of the spiritual, and that "garments of fine linen" denote truths from the Divine, is manifest 
from the signification of "garments" as being truths (see n. 1073, 2576, 4545, 4763, 5248). That "garments of fine linen" are truths from the Divine, is because a garment made of fine linen was of purest 
white and lustrous; and truth from the Divine is represented by garments of such whiteness and luster. The reason is, that the shining whiteness and luster of heaven is from the light that is from 
the Lord, and this light is the Divine truth itself (n. 1053, 1521-1533, 1619-1632, 2776, 3195, 3222, 3339, 3485, 3636, 3643, 3862, 4415, 4419, 4526, 5219); and therefore when the Lord was transfigured 
before Peter, James, and John, His garments appeared "as the light" (Matt. 17:2); "shining, exceeding white as snow, so as no fuller on earth can whiten them" (Mark 9:3); and "glistening" (Luke 9:29). 
It was the Divine truth itself that is from the Lord's Divine Human that was thus represented. Yet it is exterior truths that are represented by the white radiance of garments in the heavens, and 
interior truths by the brightness and resplendence of the face. Hence it is that to be "clothed in garments of fine linen" is here an external significative of the truth proceeding from the celestial 
of the spiritual; for it was in this that the Divine of the Lord then was. [2] By "fine linen" and "garments of fine linen" in other parts of the Word also is signified truth from the Divine, as in 
Ezekiel: </p>
<p>	I clothed thee with broidered work, and shod thee with badger, and I girded thee with fine linen, and covered thee with silk; thus wast thou decked with gold and silver, and thy garments were 
of fine linen and silk and broidered work (Ezek. 16:10, 13); </p>
<p>speaking of Jerusalem, by which in these verses is meant the Ancient Church. The truths of that church are described by "garments of broidered 
work, fine linen, and silk," and by being "decked with gold and silver." By "broidered work" are signified truths that are a matter of memory-knowledge; by "fine linen," natural truths; and by 
"silk," spiritual truths. [3] Again: </p>
<p>	Of fine linen in broidered work from Egypt was thy sail, that it might be to thee for an ensign; blue and crimson from the Isles of Elishah was thy covering (Ezek. 
27:7); </p>
<p>speaking of Tyre, by which also is meant the Ancient Church, but as to knowledges of good and truth; and by "fine linen in broidered work from Egypt of which was her sail," is signified 
truth from memory-knowledges, as a sign or external significative of that church. [4] In Revelation: </p>
<p>	The merchants of the earth shall weep and mourn over Babylon, for no man buyeth their merchandise 
any more; merchandise of gold, and silver, and precious stone, and pearl, and fine linen, and crimson, and silk, and every vessel of ivory, and every vessel of most precious wood, and of brass, and 
iron, and marble (Rev. 18:11-12); </p>
<p>in this passage all and each of the expressions signify such things as are of the church, thus such as are of truth and good; but here in the opposite sense, because 
spoken of Babylon. Everyone can see that such things would never have been enumerated in the Word which came down from heaven, unless there was something heavenly in each one; for why should mention 
be made of worldly wares in treating of Babylon, by which is signified the profane church? [5] Again in the same: </p>
<p>	Woe, woe, the great city, she that was clothed in fine linen, and crimson, and scarlet, 
and gilded with gold, and precious stone, and pearls (Rev. 18:16); </p>
<p>that every detail here signifies some heavenly Divine thing is obvious in the same book, where it is said of fine linen that it 
is the "righteousness of the saints": </p>
<p>	The time of the wedding of the Lamb is come, and His wife hath made herself ready. Then to her was granted that she should be clothed in fine linen, clean and 
bright; for the fine linen is the righteousness of the saints (Rev. 19:7-8); </p>
<p>that "fine linen is the righteousness of the saints" is because all who are in truth from the Divine put on the Lord's righteousness; 
for their garments are white and shining from the light that is from the Lord, and therefore truth itself is represented in heaven by what is shining white (n. 3301, 3993, 4007). It is for 
this reason also that they who are taken up into heaven out of a state of vastation appear clad in shining white, because they then put off that which is of their own righteousness, and put on that which 
is of the Lord's righteousness. [6] In order that truth from the Divine might be represented in the Jewish Church, it was commanded that there should be fine linen in the garments of Aaron, and 
also in the curtains about the ark, as we read in Moses: </p>
<p>	For Aaron thou shalt weave the tunic in checker work of fine linen, and thou shalt make a miter of fine linen (Exod. 28:39). 	They made the 
tunics of fine linen the work of the weaver for Aaron, and for his sons (Exod. 39:27). 	Thou shalt make the habitation with ten curtains; of fine twined linen, and blue, and crimson, and scarlet double-dyed 
(Exod. 26:1; 36:8). 	Thou shalt make the court of the habitation, there shall be hangings for the court of fine twined linen (Exod. 27:9, 18; 38:9). 	The veil for the gate of the court was the 
work of the embroiderer, of blue, and crimson, and scarlet double-dyed, and fine twined linen (Exod. 37:18). Fine linen was to be used because all things in the ark and about it, and also all things 
upon Aaron's garments, were representative of spiritual and celestial things. This shows how little the Word is understood when it is not known what things like these represent, and that it is scarcely 
understood at all when it is believed that there is no other holiness in the Word than that which appears in the letter.  [7] That angels who are in truth from the Divine appear clothed as in fine 
linen, that is, in what is white and shining, appears from Revelation in connection with the "white horse": </p>
<p>	He that sat upon the white horse was clothed in a vesture dipped in blood; and His name 
is called the Word. His armies in heaven followed Him upon white horses, clothed in fine linen, white and clean (Rev. 19:13-14). From all this it is very evident that fine linen is an outward thing 
significative of truth from the Divine; for He that sat upon the white horse is the Lord as to the Word, as is there openly said, and the "Word" is truth itself from the Divine. That the "white horse" 
is the internal sense of the Word may be seen above (n. 2760-2762); hence "white horses" are truths from the Divine, for all things of the internal sense of the Word are truths from the Divine, and therefore 
His armies were seen upon white horses, and were clothed in fine linen white and clean. </p>

<p align="center"><b>Elliott(1983-1999) 5319</b></p><p><b>5319.</b>
'And clothed him in robes of fine linen' means an outward sign denoting the celestial of the spiritual, 'robes of fine linen' being truths going forth from the Divine. This is clear from the meaning 
of 'robes' as truths, dealt with in <a href="1073.htm">1073</a>, <a href="2576.htm">2576</a>, <a href="4545.htm">4545</a>, <a href="4763.htm">4763</a>, <a href="5248.htm">5248</a>. The reason 'robes of fine linen' means truths going forth from the Divine is that a robe made of fine linen was absolutely white and at 
the same time shining, and truth going forth from the Divine is represented by robes which have that kind of brightness and splendour. And the reason for this is that heaven derives its brightness and 
splendour from the light that flows from the Lord; and the light that flows from the Lord is Divine Truth itself, <a href="1053.htm">1053</a>, <a href="1521.htm">1521</a>-<a href="1533.htm">1533</a>, <a href="1619.htm">1619</a>-<a href="1632.htm">1632</a>, <a href="1776.htm">1776</a>, <a href="3195.htm">3195</a>, <a href="3222.htm">3222</a>, <a href="3339.htm">3339</a>, <a href="3485.htm">3485</a>, <a href="3636.htm">3636</a>, <a href="3643.htm">3643</a>, <a href="3862.htm">3862</a>, <a href="4415.htm">4415</a>, <a href="4419.htm">4419</a>, <a href="4526.htm">4526</a>, <a href="5219.htm">5219</a>. This explains why, when the Lord was transfigured before Peter, James, and John, His clothing appeared as the light, <a href="http://bible.gospelcom.net/cgi-bin/bible?passage=Matt%2017:2&amp;version=ESV&amp;interface=print&amp;showfn=yes&amp;showxref">Matt 17:2</a>; glistening, intensely white like snow, as no fuller on 
earth could bleach them, <a href="http://bible.gospelcom.net/cgi-bin/bible?passage=Mark%209:3&amp;version=ESV&amp;interface=print&amp;showfn=yes&amp;showxref">Mark 9:3</a>; and dazzling, <a href="http://bible.gospelcom.net/cgi-bin/bible?passage=Luke%209:29&amp;version=ESV&amp;interface=print&amp;showfn=yes&amp;showxref">Luke 9:29</a>. It was Divine Truth itself going forth from the Lord's Divine Human that was represented in this manner. But they are exterior truths that 
are represented in heaven by the brightness of robes, whereas interior truths are represented by the brightness and splendour of the face. This is why 'being clothed in robes of fine linen' at this point 
means an outward sign denoting truth going forth from the celestial of the spiritual, for this was what the Lord's Divine consisted in at this time. </p>
<p></p>
<p><b>[2]</b>
 There are other places too in the Word where 
truth going forth from the Divine is meant by 'fine linen' and 'robes of fine linen', as in Ezekiel, </p>
<blockquote>
I clothed you with embroidered cloth, and shed you with badger, and swathed you in fine linen, 
and covered you in silk. Thus were you adorned with gold and silver, and your robes were fine linen, and silk, and embroidered cloth. <a href="http://bible.gospelcom.net/cgi-bin/bible?passage=Ezek%2016:10,%2013&amp;version=ESV&amp;interface=print&amp;showfn=yes&amp;showxref">Ezek 16:10, 13</a>. 
</blockquote>
<p>This refers to Jerusalem, which is used in 
these verses to mean the Ancient Church. The truths of this Church are described by robes made of embroidered cloth, fine linen, and silk, and by being adorned with gold and silver. 'Embroidered cloth' 
means truths existing as facts, 'fine linen' natural truths, and 'silk' spiritual truths.  </p>
<p></p>
<p><b>[3]</b>
 In the same prophet, </p>
<blockquote>
Fine linen with embroidered work from Egypt was your sail, that it might be 
to you an ensign; violet and purple from the islands of Elishah was your covering. <a href="http://bible.gospelcom.net/cgi-bin/bible?passage=Ezek%2027:7&amp;version=ESV&amp;interface=print&amp;showfn=yes&amp;showxref">Ezek 27:7</a>. 
</blockquote>
<p>This refers to Tyre, which too is used to mean the Ancient Church, but so far as cognitions of good and 
truth are concerned. 'Fine linen with embroidered work from Egypt, which was its sail' means truth obtained from factual knowledge, which was the outward sign of that Church. </p>
<p></p>
<p><b>[4]</b>
 In John, </p>
<blockquote>
The 
merchants of the earth will weep and mourn over Babylon, since no one buys their wares any more, wares of gold, and silver, and precious stones, and pearls, and fine linen, and purple, and silk, and 
scarlet, and all thyine wood, and every vessel of ivory, and every vessel made of most precious wood, and bronze, and iron, and marble. <a href="http://bible.gospelcom.net/cgi-bin/bible?passage=Rev%2018:11,%2012&amp;version=ESV&amp;interface=print&amp;showfn=yes&amp;showxref">Rev 18:11, 12</a>. 
</blockquote>
<p>All the specific commodities mentioned here mean 
the kinds of things that have to do with the Church and so truth and goodness. Here however they are used in the contrary sense because they are spoken of in reference to Babylon. Anyone may see that 
such commodities would never have been listed in the Word which has come down from heaven unless each one held something heavenly within it. What other reason can there be for a list of worldly wares 
when Babylon, meaning an unholy Church, is the subject? Similarly in the same book, </p>
<blockquote>
Woe, woe, the great city, you that were clothed in fine linen, and purple, and scarlet, covered<A name="fntext1"></a><A href="#fn1"><sup>a</sup></a> with gold, and 
precious stones, and pearls. <a href="http://bible.gospelcom.net/cgi-bin/bible?passage=Rev%2018:16&amp;version=ESV&amp;interface=print&amp;showfn=yes&amp;showxref">Rev 18:16</a>. 
</blockquote>
<p></p>
<p><b>[5]</b>
 The fact that each commodity means something Divine and heavenly is quite evident in the same book where it states what fine linen is, namely the righteous 
acts of the saints, </p>
<blockquote>
The time of the marriage of the Lamb has come, and His wife has made herself ready. At that time she was given fine linen, clean and shining, to wear; for the fine linen 
is the righteous acts of the saints. <a href="http://bible.gospelcom.net/cgi-bin/bible?passage=Rev%2019:7,%208&amp;version=ESV&amp;interface=print&amp;showfn=yes&amp;showxref">Rev 19:7, 8</a>. 
</blockquote>
<p>'Fine linen' is 'the righteous acts of the saints' for the reason that all those with whom truth received from the Divine exists are clothed with 
the Lord's righteousness. For their robes which are bright and shining are products of the light which flows from the Lord. Therefore in heaven truth itself is represented by 'brightness', <a href="3301.htm">3301</a>, <a href="3997.htm">3997</a>, 
<a href="4007.htm">4007</a>; and people who are being raised to heaven from a state of vastation are seen to be clothed with brightness because they are at this point casting off the robe of their own righteousness and putting 
on that of the Lord's righteousness. </p>
<p></p>
<p><b>[6]</b>
 So that truth from the Divine might be represented in the Jewish Church, they were commanded to use cotton or fine linen in Aaron's vestments, and also 
in the curtains around the Ark, referred to in Moses as follows, </p>
<blockquote>
You shall make in chequered pattern for Aaron a tunic of cotton, and you shall make a turban of cotton. <a href="http://bible.gospelcom.net/cgi-bin/bible?passage=Exod%2028:39&amp;version=ESV&amp;interface=print&amp;showfn=yes&amp;showxref">Exod 28:39</a>. 
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
They made tunics 
of cotton, the work of a weaver, for Aaron and his sons. <a href="http://bible.gospelcom.net/cgi-bin/bible?passage=Exod%2039:27&amp;version=ESV&amp;interface=print&amp;showfn=yes&amp;showxref">Exod 39:27</a>. 
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
You shall make the Dwelling-place, ten curtains -fine-twined cotton, violet and purple and twice-dyed scarlet. <a href="http://bible.gospelcom.net/cgi-bin/bible?passage=Exod%2026:1&amp;version=ESV&amp;interface=print&amp;showfn=yes&amp;showxref">Exod 26:1</a>; 
36:8. </p>
<p>You shall make the court of the Dwelling-place. The hangings for the court shall be of fine-twined cotton. <a href="http://bible.gospelcom.net/cgi-bin/bible?passage=Exod%2027:9,%2018;%2038:9&amp;version=ESV&amp;interface=print&amp;showfn=yes&amp;showxref">Exod 27:9, 18; 38:9</a>. 
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
The screen for the gate of the court, the work of an embroiderer, 
violet and purple, and twice-dyed scarlet, and fine-twined cotton. <a href="http://bible.gospelcom.net/cgi-bin/bible?passage=Exod%2038:18&amp;version=ESV&amp;interface=print&amp;showfn=yes&amp;showxref">Exod 38:18</a>. 
</blockquote>
<p>Cotton is fine linen, which they were commanded to use because each object in the Ark and around the Ark, also 
every detail of Aaron's vestments, were representative of spiritual and celestial realities. From this one may see that a person has only a meagre understanding of the Word if he does not know what 
such things represent, and scarcely any understanding at all if he thinks that the Word possesses no holiness other than that which presents itself in the letter. </p>
<p></p>
<p><b>[7]</b>
 When angels with whom truth from 
the Divine is present are seen by anyone they are clothed so to speak in fine linen, that is, in shining brightness, as is evident in John where 'a white horse' is referred to,  </p>
<p>The One seated 
on a white horse was clothed in a garment dyed with blood, and His name is called the Word. His armies in heaven were following Him on white horses; they were clothed in fine linen, white and clean. Rev. 
19:11, <a href="13.htm">13</a>, <a href="14.htm">14</a>. </p>
<p>These words show quite plainly that 'fine linen' is an outward sign denoting truth from the Divine, for 'the One seated on a white horse' is the Lord as to the Word; indeed those 
words state quite explicitly that He is the Word. The Word is truth itself received from the Divine, and 'a white horse' is the internal sense of the Word, see <a href="2760.htm">2760</a>-<a href="2762.htm">2762</a>. Consequently truths received 
from the Divine are meant by 'white horses', for such truths constitute the whole of the internal sense of the Word. This was why His armies were seen 'on white horses' and why 'they were clothed in 
fine linen, white and clean'.

`Et vestivit eum vestibus byssi': quod significet significativum externum caelestis spiritualis, et quod `vestes byssi' sint vera ex Divino, constat a significatione `vestium' quod sint vera, de qua 
n. 1073, 2576, 4545, 4763, 5248; quod `vestes byssi' sint vera ex Divino, est quia vestis ex bysso erat candidissima et simul splendens, et verum ex Divino repraesentatur per vestes talis candoris et 
talis splendoris; causa est quia candor et splendor caeli est ex luce quae a Domino, et lux quae a Domino, est ipsum Divinum Verum, n. 1053, 1521-1533, 1619-1632, 2776, 3195, (x)3222, 3339, 3485, 3636, 
3643, 3862, 4415, 4419 ,4526, 5219; quapropter cum Dominus transformatus est coram Petro, Jacobo, et Johanne, Apparuerunt vestimenta Ipsius sicut lux, Matth. xvii 2; {1}Splendentia, candida valde 
sicut nix, cujusmodi fullo super terra non potest dealbare, Marc. ix 3;  Et fulgurantia, Luc. ix 29;  fuit ipsum Divinum Verum quod a Divino Humano Domini, quod ita repraesentabatur; at sunt vera exteriora 
quae per candorem vestium in caelis repraesentantur; vera autem interiora per candorem et splendorem faciei; inde est quod `vestiri vestibus byssi' sit significativum externum hic, nempe veri 
procedentis ex caelesti spiritualis, hoc enim fuit in quo tunc Divinum Domini. [2] Per `byssum' et per `vestes byssi' etiam alibi in Verbo significatur verum quod ex Divino, ut apud Ezechielem, Vestivi 
te acupicto, et calceavi te taxo, et accinxi te bysso, et obtexi te serico. . . . Sic ornata es auro et argento, et vestes tuae byssus et sericum et acupictum, xvi 10, 13;  ibi de Hierosolyma, per 
quam in his versibus intelligitur Ecclesia Antiqua; vera illius Ecclesiae per `vestes ex acupicto, bysso, serico' et per 'ornatum ex auro et argento' describuntur; per `acupictum' significantur vera 
scientifica, per `byssum' vera naturalia, et per `sericum' vera spiritualia: [3] apud eundem, Byssus in acupictura ex Aegypto fuit expansio tua, ut esset tibi in signum: hyacinthinum et purpura ex insulis 
Elisha fuit tegumentum tuum, xxvii 7;  ibi de Tyro, per quam etiam Ecclesia Antiqua intelligitur, sed quoad cognitiones boni et veri, et per `byssum in acupictura ex Aegypto {2}quae expansio ejus' 
significatur verum ex scientificis, {3}ut signum seu significativum externum illius Ecclesiae: [4] apud Johannem,   Mercatores terrae flebunt, et plangent super Babylone, quod merces eorum nemo {4}emat 
amplius; merces auri et argenti, et lapidis pretiosi, et margaritae, et byssi, et purpurae, et serici, et coccini, et omne lignum thyinum, et omne vas elephantinum, et omne vas ex ligno pretiosissimo, 
et aere, et ferro, et marmore, Apoc. xviii 11, 12;  ibi omnia et singula significant talia quae sunt {5}Ecclesiae, ita quae sunt veri et boni, hic autem in opposito sensu, quia dicuntur de Babylone 
{6}; quisque videre potest quod talia nusquam in Verbo quod de caelo descendit, recenserentur nisi aliquid caeleste in singulis foret; quid recensio mercium mundanarum ubi agitur de Babylone, per 
quam significatur Ecclesia profana: similiter {7} apud eundem,  Vae vae, urbs magna, quae induta byssino, et {8}purpura et coccineo, inaurata auro, et lapide pretioso, et margaritis, Apoc. xviii (x)16. 
  [5] Quod singula {9}aliquod caeleste Divinum significent, patet manifeste apud eundem ubi dicitur {10}quid byssinum, quod nempe sint justitiae sanctorum,  Venit tempus nuptiarum Agni, et uxor 
Illius paravit se; tunc datum est illi ut indueretur byssino mundo et splendido; byssinum enim, sunt justitiae sanctorum, xix [7,] 8;  quod `byssinum sint justitiae sanctorum' est quia omnes illi qui 
in vero sunt ex Divino, justitiam Domini induunt; vestes enim eorum candidae et splendidae sunt ex luce quae a Domino; ipsum verum ideo in caelo repraesentatur per `candidum', n. 3301, 3993, 4007; 
inde quoque est quod illi qui ex statu vastationis elevantur in caelum, appareant induti candido, quia tunc exuunt id quod justitiae propriae est et induunt id quod justitiae Domini est. [6] Ut repraesentaretur 
verum a Divino in Ecclesia Judaica, mandatum est ut xylinum seu byssinum quoque {11} esset in vestibus Aharonis, ut et in aulaeis quae circum arcam, de quibus apud Mosen,  Pro Aharone {12}tessellabis 
tunicam xylini, et facies cidarim xylini, Exod. xxviii 39:  Fecerunt tunicas xylini, opus textoris, pro Aharone et filiis ejus, Exod. xxxix 27:  Habitaculum facies decem aulaea, xylinum 
intertextum, et hyacinthinum, et purpuram, et coccineum dibaphum, Exod. xxvi 1, xxxvi 8:  Facies atrium habitaculi, . . . tapetes erunt pro atrio ex xylino intertexto, Exod. xxvii 9, 18, xxxviii 9:  Velum 
portae atrii, opus acupictoris, hyacinthinum, et purpura, et coccineum dibaphum, et xylinum intertextum, Exod. xxxviii 18;  xylinum est byssinum, quod ideo mandatum quia singula quae in arca et 
circum arcam, tum singula quae super vestibus Aharonis, repraesentativa spiritualium et caelestium erant; inde constare potest quam parum {13}intelligitur Verbum, nisi sciatur quid talia repraesentant, 
et quod vix aliquid, si credatur quod sanctum non aliud in Verbo sit quam quod exstat in littera. [7] Quod angeli qui in vero ex Divino sunt, appareant induti quasi byssino, hoc est, in candido splendente, 
patet apud Johannem ubi agitur de equo albo,  Sedens super equo albo, . . . indutus erat vestimento tincto sanguine, et vocatur nomen Ejus Verbum. . . exercitus Ejus in caelo sequebantur Ipsum 
super equis albis, induti byssinum album et mundum, Apoc. xix 13, 14;  ex his manifeste patet quod `byssinum' sit significativum externum veri a Divino, nam `sedens super equo albo' est Dominus quoad 
Verbum; quod sit Verbum, aperte ibi dicitur; Verbum est ipsum verum a Divino; `equus albus' quod sit sensus internus Verbi, videatur n. 2760-2762, {14}inde 'equi albi' sunt vera ex Divino, nam omnia 
sensus interni Verbi sunt vera ex Divino, quapropter visi sunt exercitus Illius `super equis albis, et induti byssinum album et mundum'. @1 i et$ @2 quod fuerit$ @3 quod fuit$ @4 emit$ @5 veri,

(=a square stone or piece of wood). Latin verb from it, late, tessello = to make chequer work. Heb is       (shabats) = to interweave, to make chequer work. A V has `embroider' but RV `weave in chequer 
work'.$ @13 in Verbo intelligitur$ @14 proinde$ </p>
