<h3 align="center" class="ired">属天的奥秘 第3804节</h3>
<h4 align="center"></h4><p><strong>3804.</strong>“拉结就跑去告诉她父亲”表藉着内层真理的承认。这从“跑去告诉”和“她父亲”的含义清楚可知：“跑去告诉”是指对让人知道的情感，在这种情况下是指出于承认的情感；“她父亲”是指“拉班”所表示的良善。藉着内层真理的承认由拉结来代表，她表示对内层真理的情感。因此，这些话表示藉着内层真理的承认。此中情形是这样：雅各所代表的良善，即属世层良善的存在，和一般所有良善一样为人所知并得到承认，但它的品质若不藉着真理，就无法为人所知并得到承认。因为良善通过真理获得自己的品质，因而藉着真理为人所知并得到承认。在真理被植入在良善中之前，良善不会变成被称为仁之善的良善，并且被植入在良善中的真理的性质就决定了这良善的性质。<br />由于这个原因，一个人的良善，尽管看上看和别人的一模一样，其实并不一样；因为全世界没有哪两个人的良善是一样的。人的脸也一样，情感大部分表现在脸上，全人类没有哪两个人的脸是一模一样的。真理本身可以说构成良善的脸，而这张脸的美丽就是由真理所取的形式而产生的；但脸上的情感是由良善产生的。所有天使的形式都是这样，人若出于内在生命而处于对主之爱和对邻之仁，也会是这样。人被造为这种形式，因为他照着神的样式和形像被造；那些重生之人的灵就是这种形式，无论他们的身体看上去是什么样。由此可见，良善藉着内层真理被承认这句话是什么意思。</p>

And she ran and told her father. That this signifies acknowledgment by means of interior truths, is evident from the signification of "running and telling," as being the affection of making known, in 
the present case from acknowledgment; and from the signification of her "father," as being the good which is signified by "Laban." That the acknowledgment was by means of interior truths, is represented 
by Rachel, who signifies the affection of interior truth. From this it results that by these words is signified acknowledgment by means of interior truths. The case herein is this: The good which 
Jacob represents (which is the good of the natural), like all good in general, is known and acknowledged as to its existence, but not as to its quality, except by means of truths; for good receives its 
quality from truths, and thus by means of truths is known and acknowledged. Good does not become the good which is called the good of charity until truths are implanted in it, and such as are the truths 
that are implanted in it, such good does it become. [2] For this reason the good of one person, although it may appear precisely similar to that of another, is yet not the same; and with all persons 
whatsoever in the universe the good of one is different from that of another. It is the same with human faces, in which for the most part the affections are portrayed, and throughout the whole human 
race none are exactly alike. Truths themselves constitute as it were the face of beauty, the good of which is from the form of truth, but it is good that affects. Such are all angelic forms, and such 
would man be if from interior life he were in love to the Lord, and in charity toward his neighbor. He was created into such forms, because into the likeness and image of God; and such forms as to 
their spirits are they who are regenerated, however they may appear as to the body. From this it is evident what is meant by good being acknowledged by means of interior truths. </p>

'And she ran and told her father' means acknowledgement by means of interior truths. This is clear from the meaning of 'running and telling' as the affection for making known, in this case from acknowledgement; 
and from the meaning of 'her father' as the good meant by 'Laban'. The bringing about of that acknowledgement by means of interior truths is represented by 'Rachel', who means the affection 
for interior truth. Consequently these words mean acknowledgment by means of interior truths. The situation is this: The existence of the good which Jacob represents, the good of the natural, like all 
good in general, is known and acknowledged, but not the specific character of it except by means of truths. For good receives its own specific character from truths, and so it is by means of truths 
that it is known and acknowledged. For good does not become the good which is called the good of charity until truths have been implanted in it. And the character of the truths implanted in it determines 
that of the good. </p>

<p><b>[2]</b>
 This is why one person's good, though seemingly just the same, is not however like another's, for the good in every single human being throughout the whole world is different 
from that in any other. It is like human faces in which for the most part affections present themselves, in that none throughout the whole human race is exactly like another. Truths themselves compose 
so to speak the face of good, whose beauty arises from the form which truth takes; but it is good that produces the affections there. All angelic forms are such, and man would be such if from interior 
life he were ruled by love to the Lord and charity towards the neighbour. Man was created into forms such as these because he was created in the likeness and image of God, and forms such as these 
are the ones whose spirits have been regenerated, whatever appearance their bodies present. From this one may see what is meant by the statement that good is acknowledged by means of interior truths. </p>

`Et cucurrit et indicavit patri suo':  quod significet agnitionem per interiora vera, constat ex significatione `currere et indicare' quod sit affectio notum faciendi, hic ex agnitione; et ex significatione 
`patris sui' quod sit bonum quod `Laban'; quod per vera interiora, repraesentatur per `Rachelem,' quae est affectio veri interioris; inde resultat quod per illa verba significetur agnitio 
per interiora vera.  Cum his ita se(t) habet: </p>
<p>bonum quod `Jacob' repraesentat, quod est bonum naturalis, sicut omne bonum in genere, {1} cognoscitur et agnoscitur quod sit, non autem quale sit, 
nisi per vera; bonum enim suum quale accipit a veris, et sic per vera cognoscitur et agnoscitur; bonum enim non fit bonum quod charitatis vocatur, antequam implantata ei sunt vera; et qualia vera ei 
implantantur, tale fit bonum; [2] inde est quod unius bonum, tametsi simillimum apparet, non tamen est sicut alterius, nam bonum in omnibus et singulis qui in universo terrarum orbe, inde differt; 
se habet hoc sicut facies humanae, in quibus se utplurimum affectiones effigiant, quod nusquam in universo genere humano dentur prorsus similes; ipsa vera faciunt sicut faciem boni, cujus pulchritudo 
est a forma veri, sed quod afficit, est bonum; </p>
<p>tales sunt formae angelicae omnes, et talis foret homo, si in amore in Dominum et in charitate erga proximum ab interiore vita foret; </p>
<p>in tales formas 
est homo creatus quia in similitudinem et imaginem Dei; et tales formae sunt illi qui regenerati sunt quoad spiritus suos, utcumque apparent quoad corpus. Inde constare potest quid intelligitur 
per quod agnoscatur bonum per interiora vera. @1 i quidem$ </p>
