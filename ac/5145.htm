<h3 align="center" class="ired">属天的奥秘 第5145节</h3>
<h4 align="center"></h4><p><strong>5145.</strong>“它们上面有洞，在我头上”表中间任何地方都没有终端。这从“它们上面有洞”和“头”的含义清楚可知：“它们上面有洞”是指从顶部到底部都是敞开的，因而是指未被关闭，因而中间任何地方都没有终端；“头”是指内层，尤指构成意愿的内层。因为头是一切实质与形式所在的首要位置；因此，一切感觉都传到头部，并在此呈现自己；而一切行为都从它降下，并源于它。显然，心智的能力，也就是理解力和意愿的能力就在头部；这就是为何“头”表示内层。（膳长所梦见的）这些筐子代表“头”里面的事物。<br />现在论述的主题是受意愿部分支配的感官印象，“它们（筐子）上面有洞”表示内层在中间任何地方都没有终端；因此，如下文所看到的这些感官印象被抛弃和定罪。不过，有必要解释一下“中间任何地方都没有终端”是什么意思。人的内层被分为不同层级，每个层级都有自己的终端，以将它与在它之下的层级分开。从最内层到最外层的每一层级都是如此。内层理性层构成第一层级；属天天使，即至内层或第三层天堂就在该层级。外层理性层构成第二层级，属灵天使，即中间或第二层天堂就在该层级。内层属世层构成第三层级，善灵，即最后和最低，或第一层天堂就在该层级。外层属世层或感官层构成第四层级，世人就在该层级。<br />这些层级也存在于人里面，各层级彼此完全不同，又互相分离。正因如此，若人过着一种良善生活，那么就其内层而言，他就是一个最小形式的天堂，或说他的内层对应于三层天堂；也正因如此，若人过着一种仁与爱的生活，他死后就能被一直提升到第三层天堂。不过，为叫他具有这种特质，他里面的各个层级必须具有自己特定的终端，以将它与下一层级分开。当这些层级有了这些使它们彼此不同而又互相分离的终端时，每一层级都是一个从主所流入的良善能止于其上，并在那里被接受的一个层级。没有作为层面的这类终端，良善就不被接受，而是直接流过去，如同流过里面有洞的筛子或筐子，一直向下流入感官层。此时，这良善因一路上没有任何方向，于是就转变为污秽，尽管在那些在这最低层接受它的人看来，污秽好似良善。也就是说，良善被变成属于爱自己爱世界的那种快乐，因而被变成属于仇恨、报复、残忍、奸淫和贪婪的那种快乐，或被变成纯粹的快感和奢侈享受。如果人的意愿层级中间任何地方都没有终端，也就是说“它们上面有洞”，这种情形就会发生。<br />人其实能知道这些终端、因而层面是否存在；因为人有能力觉知良善与真理，如他们的良善就能指示这一点。对那些像属天天使那样有能力觉知良善与真理的人来说，终端存在于每一层级，从最初层级直到最后层级。若非各个层级都有自己的终端，诸如此类的觉知能力是不可能存在的。关于这些觉知能力，可参看前文（<a href="125.htm">125</a>，<a href="202.htm">202</a>，<a href="495.htm">495</a>，<a href="503.htm">503</a>，<a href="511.htm">511</a>，<a href="536.htm">536</a>，<a href="597.htm">597</a>，<a href="607.htm">607</a>，<a href="784.htm">784</a>，<a href="865.htm">865</a>，<a href="895.htm">895</a>，<a href="1121.htm">1121</a>，<a href="1383.htm">1383</a>，<a href="1384.htm">1384</a>，<a href="1387.htm">1387</a>，<a href="1919.htm">1919</a>，<a href="2144.htm">2144</a>，<a href="2145.htm">2145</a>，<a href="2171.htm">2171</a>，<a href="2515.htm">2515</a>，<a href="2831.htm">2831</a>节）。对那些像属灵天使那样拥有良心的人来说，终端同样存在，但只存在于第二层级或第三层级，直到最后层级。因为对这些天使来说，第一层级是关闭的。之所以说“在第二层级或第三层级”，是因为良心是由两部分组成的，即内层与外层。内层良善是涉及属灵良善与真理的良心，外层良善是涉及公义与公平的良心。良心本身是神性良善的流注终止于其中的一个内层层面。但那些没有良心的人没有接受该流注的任何内层层级；对这些人来说，良善直接流入外层属世层或属世感官层；并且如前所述，在那里被变为污秽的快乐。有时这些人会感到痛苦，貌似良心的痛苦，但这不是良心。这种痛苦是由于其快乐的丧失造成的，就是诸如地位、利益、名声、生命、乐趣，或像他们那样之人的友谊的丧失。他们遭受痛苦是因为，他们所拥有的终端在于这类快乐。由此可见“筐子上面有洞”在灵义上是什么意思。<br />尤其在来世，人能辨别出人的意愿层级是否具有终端。对具有终端的人来说，有一种对属灵的良善与真理，或对公义与公平的热情存在。因为这种人为了良善或真理而行良善，并为了公义或公平而践行公义，而不是为了利益、地位等等。凡意愿的内层具有终端的人都被提升进入天堂，因为所流入的神性能把他们引到那里。但是，凡意愿的内层没有终端的人则下入地狱；因为神性直接流了过去，被变成地狱之物，正如太阳的热落到污秽的粪便上，发出刺鼻的恶臭之时的情形。因此，凡有良心的人都会得救；但那些没有良心的人不能得救。<br />当对良善与真理，或公义与公平没有情感，以及与其它事物相比，这些美德被视为一文不值，或微不足道的事物，又或被重视只是为了获得利益或地位时，就可以说意愿的层级上面有洞。情感就是那提供终端，用来关闭的东西，这也是为何它们被称为约束或束缚：对良善与真理的情感是“内在约束”，对邪恶与虚假的情感是“外在约束”（<a href="3835.htm">3835</a>节）。若非对邪恶与虚假的情感起到约束作用，人必要疯狂（<a href="4217.htm">4217</a>节）；因为疯狂无非是对这类约束的放松，以致终端在这类人里面不存在。尽管如此，就思维与情感而言，这些人没有任何内在约束，因而内心是疯狂的，而他们没有爆发是因着外在约束，这些约束就是为了自己而对利益、地位或名声的情感，因而是对法律和生命丧失的畏惧。这在犹太教会以这一律法来代表：在死人的家里，凡敞口的器皿，就是没有扎上盖的，都是不洁净的（民数记<a href="http://39-27.cn/民19.15.htm">19:15</a>）。<br />在以赛亚书，“满了洞的织物”所表相同：<br />用丝线做麻布的和织满了洞的织物的都必羞愧。它的根基必被打碎，所有受薪的，心必愁烦。（以赛亚书<a href="http://39-27.cn/赛19.9.htm">19:9</a>，<a href="http://39-27.cn/赛19.10.htm">10</a>）<br />以西结书中的“窟窿（即洞）”所表也相同：<br />灵领我（即先知）到院门口。我观看，见墙上有个窟窿。他对我说，你要在这墙上挖一个洞。我一挖墙，见有一门。他对我说，你进去，看他们在这里所行可憎的恶事。我进去一看，看哪，四面墙上刻着各样爬行的动物、可憎的走兽和以色列家各样的偶像。（以西结书<a href="http://39-27.cn/结8.7.htm">8:7</a>-<a href="http://39-27.cn/结8.10.htm">10</a>）</p>

With holes in them upon my head. That this signifies without termination anywhere in the middle, is evident from the signification of "with holes in them," as being open from highest to lowest, thus 
not closed, consequently without termination anywhere in the middle; and from the signification of the "head," as being the interiors, especially those of the will; for in the head are all substances 
and forms in their beginnings, and therefore all sensations tend thither and there present themselves, and all acts descend from it and take their origin. It is evident that the faculties of the mind, 
that is, of the understanding and the will, are there; and therefore by the "head" are signified the interiors. These baskets represented the things which are in the head.  [2] The sensuous things which 
are subject to the will part are now treated of, and by the "baskets with holes in them upon the head" is signified that the interiors were without termination anywhere in the middle, and for this 
reason these sensuous things were rejected and damned-as will be seen in what follows. But it may be well to state what is meant by being without termination anywhere in the middle. Man's interiors 
are distinguished into degrees, and in each degree the interiors are terminated, and by termination are separated from the degree next below; it is thus from the inmost to the outermost. The interior 
rational constitutes the first degree; in this are the celestial angels, or in this is the inmost or third heaven. The exterior rational makes the second degree; in this are the spiritual angels, or in 
this is the middle or second heaven. The interior natural makes the third degree; in this are good spirits, or the ultimate or first heaven. The exterior natural, or the sensuous, makes the fourth degree; 
and in this is man. These degrees in man are most distinct. [3] Thence it is that if he lives in good, a man is as to his interiors a heaven in the least form, or that his interiors correspond 
to the three heavens; and hence it is that if a man has lived a life of charity and love, he can be carried after death even into the third heaven. But that he may be of this character, it is necessary 
that all the degrees in him should be well terminated, and thus by means of terminations be distinct from one another; and when they are terminated, or by means of terminations are made distinct from 
one another, each degree is a plane in which the good which flows in from the Lord rests, and where it is received. Without these degrees as planes, good is not received, but flows through, as through 
a sieve or a basket that has holes in it, down to the sensuous, and then, being without any direction in the way, it is turned into a foulness which appears to those who are in it as good, namely, 
into the delight of the love of self and of the world, consequently into the delight of hatred, revenge, cruelty, adultery, and avarice, or into mere voluptuousness and luxury. This is the case if the 
things of man's will are without termination anywhere in the middle, or if they "have holes in them."  [4] It is quite possible to know whether there are these terminations and consequent planes; for 
the perceptions of good and truth, and of conscience, show this. With those who have perceptions of good and truth, as have the celestial angels, the terminations are from the first degree to the last; 
for without terminations of all the degrees, such perceptions are impossible. (In regard to these perceptions, see above, n. 125, 202, 495, 503, 511, 536, 597, 607, 784, 865, 895, 1121, 1383, 1384, 
1387, 1919, 2144, 2145, 2171, 2515, 2831.) With those also who have conscience, as the spiritual angels have, there are terminations, but from the second degree or from the third to the last, the first 
degree being closed with these angels. It is said "from the second degree" or "from the third," because conscience is twofold, interior and exterior; interior conscience is that of spiritual good 
and truth, exterior conscience is that of what is just and equitable. Conscience itself is an interior plane in which the influx of the Divine good terminates. But they who have no conscience have not 
any interior plane to receive this influx; and with these persons good flows through down to the exterior natural or natural-sensuous; and as before said is there turned into foul delights. Sometimes 
these persons seem to feel a pain as of conscience, but it is not conscience; it is a pain arising from the loss of their delight, such as that of honor, gain, reputation, life, pleasures, or the friendship 
of people like themselves; and this is because the terminations are in delights like these. From all this it is evident what is signified in the spiritual sense by the baskets with holes in them. 
 [5] In the other life especially is it discerned whether the things of a man's will have or have not been terminated. With those in whom they have been terminated there is zeal for spiritual good 
and truth, or for what is just and equitable, for these persons have done what is good for the sake of good or for the sake of truth, and have acted justly for the sake of what is just or equitable, 
and not for the sake of gain, honor, and things like these. All those with whom the interiors of the will have been terminated are taken up into heaven, for the Divine that flows in can lead them, whereas 
all those with whom the interior things of the will have not been terminated, betake themselves into hell; for the Divine flows through, and is turned into what is infernal, just as when the heat 
of the sun falls upon foul excrements, and causes a noisome stench. Consequently all who have had conscience are saved; but they who have had no conscience cannot be saved. [6] The things of the will 
are said to have holes in them, or not to be terminated, when there is no affection of good and truth, or of what is just and equitable; and also when these things are regarded as comparatively worthless 
or as nothing, or are valued solely for the sake of securing gain or honor. The affections are what terminate and close, and are therefore called "bonds" - affections of good and truth "internal 
bonds," and affections of evil and falsity "external bonds" (n. 3835). Unless the affections of evil and falsity were bonds, the man would be insane (n. 4217); for insanities are nothing else than the 
loosenings of such bonds; thus they are non-terminations in such persons; but as in these persons there are no internal bonds, they are inwardly insane in respect to the thoughts and affections, while 
restrained from breaking out by external bonds, which are affections of gain and honor, and of reputation as a means of acquiring these, and the consequent fear of the law and of the loss of life. 
This was represented in the Jewish Church by the fact that every open vessel in the house of a dead person upon which there was no cloth cover was unclean (Num. 19:15). [7] Similar things are signified 
by "works full of holes" in Isaiah: </p>
<p>	They that make thread of silks, and they that weave works full of holes, shall blush; and the foundations thereof shall be broken in pieces, all they that make 
hire pools of the soul (Isa. 19:9-10); </p>
<p>and by "holes" in Ezekiel: </p>
<p>	The spirit brought the prophet to the door of the court; where he saw, and behold a hole in the wall; and he said unto him, Come 
bore a hole through the wall; he therefore bored through the wall, and behold a door; then said he unto him, Go in and see the abominations that they do here. When he went in and saw, behold every figure 
of creeping thing and beast, an abomination, and all the idols of the house of Israel, portrayed upon the walls round about (Ezek. 8:7-10). </p>

<p align="center"><b>Elliott(1983-1999) 5145</b></p><p><b>5145.</b>
'With holes in them were on my head' means without a termination anywhere at all in the middle. This is clear from the meaning of 'with holes in' as that which is open from top to bottom, thus that which 
is not closed and therefore has no termination anywhere at all in the middle; and from the meaning of 'the head' as interior degrees, in particular those that constitute the will. For the head is 
the primary location where all substances and forms exist, and is therefore the place to which all sensations travel and register themselves, and the place from which all actions spring and are derived. 
The powers of the mind too - the power of understanding and that of the will - are plainly located there, which is why interior degrees are meant by 'the head'. 'The baskets' [in the baker's dream] 
represented those powers within 'the head'. </p>
<p></p>
<p><b>[2]</b>
 The subject at present is the sensory impressions subject to the will part of the mind, 'baskets on the head with holes in them' meaning that interior 
degrees existed without a termination anywhere at all in the middle. Therefore those sensory impressions, as follows from this, were cast aside and condemned. But some explanation must be given of 
what is meant by 'without a termination anywhere at all in the middle'. Interiorly the human being is divided into separate degrees, and each degree has its own termination that serves to separate it 
from the degree beneath it. This is so with every degree from the inmost one to the outermost. The interior rational constitutes the first degree, the degree in which celestial angels are, that is, where 
the inmost or third heaven is. The exterior rational makes up the second degree, the one in which spiritual angels are, that is, where the middle or second heaven is. The interior natural makes up 
the third degree, the one in which good spirits are, that is, where the last and lowest or first heaven is. And the exterior natural, the level of the senses, makes up the fourth degree, in which man 
is. </p>
<p></p>
<p><b>[3]</b>
 These degrees also exist within man, each degree completely distinct and separate. Consequently, if he leads a good life, he is interiorly a miniature heaven; that is, his interiors correspond 
to the three heavens. Also, if he has led a life of charity and love he can be taken after death all the way up to the third heaven. But if he is to be someone like this, each degree within him 
must be furnished with its own specific termination that makes it separate from the next one. When those degrees do have those terminations, making them distinct and separate from one another, each degree 
has a floor on which good flowing in from the Lord can rest and where it is received. Without such terminations acting as floors that good is not received but passes straight through, as if through 
a sieve or through 'a basket with holes in it', down to the sensory level. There, because it has not received any direction on the way, this good is turned into something foul, though it is seen as 
good by the recipients of it at that lowest level. That is to say, the good is turned into the kind of delight that belongs to a selfish and worldly love, and consequently into the kind of delight that 
belongs to hatred, revenge, cruelty, adultery, and avarice, or into sheer self-gratification and personal extravagance. This is what happens if the degrees of a person's will exist without a termination 
anywhere at all in the middle, that is, if 'they have holes in them'. </p>
<p></p>
<p><b>[4]</b>
 One can also actually know whether these terminations and therefore floors exist; people's abilities to perceive what 
is good and true point to the existence of them, as do their consciences. In the case of those who, like celestial angels, have the ability to perceive what is good and true, terminations exist in every 
degree, from the first to the last. Unless each degree has its own termination, no perceptive abilities such as these can exist. Regarding these abilities, see <a href="125.htm">125</a>, <a href="202.htm">202</a>, <a href="495.htm">495</a>, <a href="503.htm">503</a>, <a href="511.htm">511</a>, <a href="536.htm">536</a>, <a href="597.htm">597</a>, <a href="607.htm">607</a>, <a href="784.htm">784</a>, <a href="865.htm">865</a>, <a href="895.htm">895</a>, <a href="1121.htm">1121</a>, <a href="1383.htm">1383</a>, <a href="1384.htm">1384</a>, <a href="1387.htm">1387</a>, <a href="1919.htm">1919</a>, <a href="1144.htm">1144</a>, <a href="2145.htm">2145</a>, <a href="2171.htm">2171</a>, <a href="2515.htm">2515</a>, <a href="2831.htm">2831</a>. In the case of those who, like spiritual angels, have conscience, terminations likewise exist, but only in the second degree 
or else in the third down to the last. For them the first degree is closed. One must say in the second degree or else in the third because conscience is twofold - interior and exterior. Interior 
conscience is one that concerns itself with what is spiritually good and true, exterior conscience one that concerns itself with what is just and fair. Conscience itself is an interior floor which provides 
inflowing Divine Good with a termination; but those who have no conscience do not have any interior floor to receive that influx. In their case good passes straight through to the exterior natural, 
or the natural level of the senses, where it is turned, as has been stated, into foul delights. These people sometimes feel pain like that of conscience, but this is not conscience. The pain is caused 
by the loss of what they delight in, such as the loss of position, gain, reputation, life, pleasures, or the friendship of others who are like themselves. They suffer pain because the terminations 
which they possess consist in those kinds of delights. From all this one may see what is meant in the spiritual sense by 'baskets with holes in them'. </p>
<p></p>
<p><b>[5]</b>
 Particularly so in the next life one can 
discern whether or not the degrees of a person's will have been furnished with terminations. In the case of one who has been furnished with them, a zeal exists for what is spiritually good and true or 
for what is just and fair. For such persons had done what was good for the sake of what was good or for the sake of what was true, and had practised what was just for the sake of what was just or for 
the sake of what was fair, not for the sake of gain, position, and the like. All whose interior degrees of the will have been furnished with terminations are raised up to heaven, for the inflowing Divine 
is able to lead them there. But all whose interior degrees of the will have not been furnished with terminations make their way to hell, for what is Divine passes straight through and is turned 
into that which is hell-like, as when the heat of the sun falls on foul excrement and a disgusting stench is given off by it. Consequently all who have had conscience are saved, but those who have had 
none are incapable of being saved. </p>
<p></p>
<p><b>[6]</b>
 Degrees of the will are said to have holes in them, or to have no terminations, when there is no affection for goodness and truth, or for justice and equity, 
and when these virtues are considered to be of little or no value at all compared with anything else, or are esteemed solely for the sake of acquiring gain or position. The affections are what supply 
terminations and serve to close off, which is also why they are called bonds or restraints - affections for what is good and true being internal bonds, and affections for what is evil and false external 
ones, <a href="3835.htm">3835</a>. Unless the affections for what is evil and false acted as bonds or restraints the person would be insane, <a href="4217.htm">4217</a>; for insanity is nothing else than the removal of such restraints, so that 
no terminations are present in such persons. Even so, though these people do not possess any internal restraints and are therefore inwardly insane, so far as their thoughts and affections are concerned, 
an eruption of these is held back by external restraints, which consist in affections for gain, position, or reputation for their own sake, and consequently in a fear of the law or of loss of life. 
This was represented in the Jewish Church by the law that in the house of one who had died every open vessel which had no covering [or] cord [to fasten it] was unclean, <a href="http://bible.gospelcom.net/cgi-bin/bible?passage=Num%2019:15&amp;version=ESV&amp;interface=print&amp;showfn=yes&amp;showxref">Num 19:15</a>. </p>
<p></p>
<p><b>[7]</b>
 Much the 
same is also meant by 'works full of holes' in Isaiah, </p>
<blockquote>
Those that make linen out of silk [thread], and those that weave works full of holes, will blush. And its foundations will be broken to pieces 
- all those making pools of the soul<A name="fntext1"></a><A href="#fn1"><sup>a</sup></a> their wages. <a href="http://bible.gospelcom.net/cgi-bin/bible?passage=Isa%2019:9,%2010&amp;version=ESV&amp;interface=print&amp;showfn=yes&amp;showxref">Isa 19:9, 10</a>. 
</blockquote>
<p>And by 'holes' in Ezekiel, </p>
<blockquote>
The Spirit brought the prophet to the door of the court, where he looked, and behold, a hole in the 
wall. And He said to him, Son of man, bore a hole through the wall. He therefore bore a hole through the wall, and behold, a door. Then He said to him, Go in and see the abominations that they do here. 
When he went in and saw, behold, every likeness of creeping thing and of beast, an abomination; and all the idols of the house of Israel, portrayed on the wall round about, etc. <a href="http://bible.gospelcom.net/cgi-bin/bible?passage=Ezek%208:7-10&amp;version=ESV&amp;interface=print&amp;showfn=yes&amp;showxref">Ezek 8:7-10</a>.

et luxuriosum; hoc fit si voluntaria apud hominem sunt {6} absque terminatione alicubi in medio, aut si sunt {6} perforata.  [4] Num terminationes sint, et inde plana, etiam sciri potest; perceptiones 
boni et veri, ac conscientiae id indicant; apud illos qui perceptiones boni et veri habent, sicut angeli caelestes, terminationes sunt a primo gradu ad ultimum; absque terminationibus singulorum 
graduum tales perceptiones dari nequeunt; de perceptionibus illis videatur n. 125, 202, 495, 503, 511, 536, 597, 607, 784, 865, 895, 1121, 1383, 1384, 1387, 1919, 2144, 2145, 2171, 2515, 2831; 
apud illos qui conscientiam habent, sicut angeli spirituales, etiam terminationes sunt, sed ab altero gradu, seu {7} a tertio ad ultimum; primus gradus illis est clausus; ab altero gradu aut {8} tertio 
dicitur quia conscientia est duplex, interior et exterior; conscientia interior est boni et veri spiritualis, conscientia exterior est justi et aequi, ipsa conscientia est planum interius, in 
quo terminatur influxus Divini Boni; at qui non conscientiam habent, illi non habent aliquod planum interius quod recipit influxum; </p>
<p>bonum apud illos transfluit usque ad exterius naturale seu naturale sensuale, 
et ibi vertitur, ut dictum, in spurca jucunda; apparet his quandoque dolor sicut conscientiae, sed non est conscientia, est dolor ex privatione jucundi sui, sicut honoris, lucri, famae, vitae, 
voluptatum, amicitiae talium, et hoc est inde quia terminationes sunt in talibus jucundis; ex his constare potest quid in sensu spirituali significatur per canistra perforata'.  [5] In altera 
vita imprimis dignoscitur num apud hominem voluntaria terminata fuerint vel non terminata; apud quem terminata fuerunt, est zelus pro bono et vero spirituali, vel pro justo et aequo, illi enim 
bonum fecerant propter bonum vel propter verum, et justum egerant propter justum aut aequum, non propter lucrum, honorem, et similia; omnes illi apud quos voluntaria interiora terminata fuerunt, elevantur 
ad caelum, nam Divinum influens (c)eos ducere potest; at omnes illi apud quos voluntaria interiora non terminata fuerunt, se ferunt in infernum, nam transfluit Divinum et vertitur in infernale, 
sicut cum {9} solis calor incidit in foeda excrementa, unde putor graveolens; consequenter omnes illi qui conscientiam habuerunt, salvantur, at qui nullam habuerunt, non salvari possunt.  [6] 
Tunc perforata seu non terminata dicuntur voluntaria, cum nulla est affectio boni et veri, aut {10} justi et aequi, sed cum haec pro vili aut pro nihilo habentur respective, (o)aut aestimantur solum 
captandi lucri aut honoris causa; </p>
<p>affectiones sunt quae terminant et quae claudunt, quapropter etiam vocantur vincula, affectiones boni et veri vincula interna, et affectiones mali et falsi vincula 
externa, (o)n. 3835; nisi affectiones mali et falsi forent vincula, insaniret homo, (o)n. 4217, insaniae enim non aliud sunt quam solutiones talium vinculorum, ita non terminationes in illis; sed 
quia his non sunt vincula interna, ideo insaniunt intus quoad cogitationes et affectiones, moderantibus vinculis externis quae sunt affectiones lucri, honoris, famae (o)propter illa, et inde timores 
legis et vitae, ne erumpant; hoc repraesentatum fuit in Ecclesia Judaica per quod </p>
<p>          In domo mortui {11} omne vas apertum, super quo non      operculum panniculus, immundum esset, Num. 
xix 15; </p>
<p> [7] similia etiam per {12} opera foraminosa significantur apud Esaiam, </p>
<p>          Erubescent facientes linum sericorum, et texentes      foraminosa opera; et erunt fundamenta ejus contusa; 
omnes      facientes mercedem stagna animae, xix 9, 10: </p>
<p> et per foramina apud Ezechielem, </p>
<p>          Spiritus introduxit prophetam ad portam atrii, ubi      vidit {13}, cum ecce foramen unum 
in pariete; et dixit ad      illum {14}, [Fili hominis] perfora age parietem,      perforavit itaque parietem, cum ecce ostium unum; tunc      dixit ad illum, Intra et vide abominationes quas illi  
    faciunt hic; cum intravit et vidit, ecce omnis effigies      reptilis et bestiae, abominatio, et omnia idola domus      Israelis depicta super pariete circumcirca seq. viii 7- </p>
