<h3 align="center" class="ired">属天的奥秘 第4153节</h3>
<h4 align="center"></h4><p><strong>4153.</strong>“拉班进了雅各的帐棚、利亚的帐棚并两个使女的帐棚，都没有找到它们”表它们的神圣事物中没有这类真理。这从“帐棚”的含义清楚可知，“帐棚”是指神圣或圣洁（参看<a href="414.htm">414</a>，<a href="1102.htm">1102</a>，<a href="2145.htm">2145</a>，<a href="2152.htm">2152</a>，<a href="3210.htm">3210</a>，<a href="3312.htm">3312</a>，<a href="4128.htm">4128</a>节），在此是指神圣事物，因为它们是雅各、利亚和使女们的帐棚。所提及的真理并不在那里，这一点以拉班在那里没有找到家中神像来表示。“家中神像”在正面意义上表示真理（参看<a href="4111.htm">4111</a>节）；“雅各”代表属世层的良善，“利亚”代表对外在真理的情感，“使女”代表外在情感，如前所示。由于此处所提及的真理不是外在的，而是内在的，所以它们没有这些人的帐棚里，也就是在它们的神圣事物中被找到，而是在拉结的帐棚里，也就是在对内层真理的情感的神圣中；因为“拉结”代表对内层真理的情感。</p>

And Laban came into Jacob's tent, and into Leah's tent, and into the tent of the two handmaids, and found them not. That this signifies that in their holy things there were not such truths, is evident 
from the signification of a "tent," as being what is holy (see n. 414, 1102, 2145, 2152, 3210, 3312, 4128), here, holy things, because they were the tents of Jacob, Leah, and the handmaids. That the 
truths in question were not there, is signified by his not finding the teraphim there. (That in a good sense "teraphim" are truths, may be seen above, n. 4111.) By Jacob is represented the good of the 
natural; by Leah, the affection of external truth; and by the handmaids, external affections, as shown above; and as the truths which are here in question were not external, but internal, they were 
not found in the tents of these persons (that is, in their holy things), but were in Rachel's tent, that is, in the holy of the affection of interior truth; for by Rachel is represented the affection 
of interior truth. </p>

'Laban came into Jacob's tent, and into Leah's tent, and into the tent of both servant-girls, and did not find them' means that within the holiness which these possessed no such truths were present. 
This is clear from the meaning of 'a tent' as holiness, dealt with in <a href="414.htm">414</a>, <a href="1102.htm">1102</a>, <a href="2145.htm">2145</a>, <a href="2152.htm">2152</a>, <a href="3210.htm">3210</a>, <a href="3312.htm">3312</a>, <a href="4128.htm">4128</a>, in this case the holiness which their tents possessed since each one's tent is mentioned 
- Jacob's, Leah's, and the servant-girls'. The non-presence of those truths within this holiness is meant by the teraphim not being found there in those tents. In the good sense 'teraphim' means truths, 
see above in <a href="4111.htm">4111</a>; 'Jacob' represents the good of the natural, 'Leah' the affection for external truth, and 'the servant-girls' external affections, each of which have been dealt with already. And 
because the truths referred to here were not external but internal, the teraphim were not found in the tents of these persons, that is, in the holiness of any of them, but were in Rachel's tent, that 
is, in the holiness belonging to the affection for interior truth; for 'Rachel' represents the affection for interior truth. </p>

</p><b>4153.</b>
`Venit Laban in tentorium Jacobi, et in tentorium Leae, et in tentorium ambarum ancillarum, et non invenit': quod significet quod in sanctis illorum non talia vera essent, constat a significatione 
`tentorii' quod sit sanctum, de qua n. 414, 1102, 2145, 2152, 3210, 3312, 4128; hic sancta quia tentoria, nempe Jacobi, Leae et ancillarum; quod non illa vera ibi, significatur per `teraphim, qui 
ibi non inventi'; quod `teraphim' in bono sensu sint vera, videatur supra n. 4111; per `Jacobum' repraesentatur bonum naturalis, per `Leam' affectio veri externi, et per `ancillas' affectiones externae, 
de quibus prius; et quia vera de quibus hic agitur, non erant externa sed interna, ideo non in eorum tentoriis, hoc est, sanctis, inventa sunt; sed erant in tentorio Rachelis, hoc est, in sancto 
affectionis veri interioris, per `Rachelem' enim affectio veri interioris repraesentatur. </p>
