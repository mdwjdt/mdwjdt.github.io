<h3 align="center" class="ired">属天的奥秘 第3452节</h3>
<h4 align="center"></h4><p><strong>3452.</strong>“便说，让我们之间，就是我们和你之间，彼此起誓，让我们与你立约”表就本身而言，其信之教义事物不应被否认，也就是说，只要它们取自圣言的字义。这从“我们之间起誓”、“我们与你之间”和“让我们立约”的含义清楚可知：“我们之间起誓”是指教义事物与圣言字义的一致性；“我们与你之间”是指与内义的一致性；“让我们立约”是指他们能以这种方式被联结起来，“约”是指结合（参看<a href="665.htm">665</a>，<a href="666.htm">666</a>，<a href="1023.htm">1023</a>，<a href="1038.htm">1038</a>，<a href="1864.htm">1864</a>，<a href="2003.htm">2003</a>，<a href="2021.htm">2021</a>节） 。由此而来的意思是，既然如此，就本身而言，其信之教义事物不应被否认；因为如前所述，教义事物只要取自圣言，就不会被否认。它们为主所悦纳，只要拥有它们的这个人过着仁爱的生活，因为圣言中的一切事物都能与仁爱的生活相结合。不过，圣言的内层事物会与存在于仁爱所流出的内层良善中的生活结合。可参看前面所阐述和引用的内容（<a href="3324.htm">3324</a>节）。</p>

<p align="center"><b>Potts(1905-1910) 3452</b></p><p><b>3452.</b>
And we said, Now let there be an oath between us, between us and thee, and let us cut out a covenant with thee. That this signifies that regarded in themselves the doctrinal things of their faith should 
not be denied, that is, insofar as they are from the literal sense of the Word, is evident from the signification of "an oath between us," as being the agreement of the doctrinal things with the literal 
sense of the Word; from the signification of "between us and thee," as being the agreement with the internal sense; and from the signification of "let us cut out a covenant," as being that thus 
there might be conjunction. (That a "covenant" is conjunction, may be seen above, n. 665, 666, 1023, 1038, 1864, 2003, 2021.) The sense hence resulting is that because this is the case, regarded in themselves 
the doctrinal things of their faith should not be denied; for as before said no doctrinal things whatever are denied provided they are from the Word, for they are accepted by the Lord provided 
that he who is in them is in the life of charity, because with this life all things of the Word can be conjoined; but the interior things of the Word are conjoined with the life which is in the interior 
good of charity. See what has been stated and adduced above (n. 3224). </p>

'And we said, Let there be now a solemn agreement between us, between us and you, and let us make a covenant with you' means that their matters of doctrine concerning faith, regarded in themselves, should 
not be refused recognition, that is to say, insofar as they are drawn from the literal sense of the Word. This is clear from the meaning of 'a solemn agreement between us' as the general agreement 
between matters of doctrine and the literal sense of the Word; from the meaning of 'between us and you' as agreement with the internal sense; and from the meaning of 'let us make a covenant' as the 
fact that in this way they could be joined together - 'a covenant' meaning a joining together, see <a href="665.htm">665</a>,<a href="666.htm">666</a>, <a href="1023.htm">1023</a>, <a href="1038.htm">1038</a>, <a href="1864.htm">1864</a>, <a href="2003.htm">2003</a>, <a href="2021.htm">2021</a>. The meaning which flows from all this is that this being so, 
their matters of doctrine concerning faith, regarded in themselves, should not be refused recognition, for as has been stated, no matters of doctrine at all, provided they are drawn from the Word, are 
refused recognition. They are acceptable to the Lord provided that the person who possesses them is leading a charitable life, for everything in the Word is able to be joined to that life. But the interior 
aspects of the Word are able to be joined to the life present in the interior good that flows from charity. See what has been stated and brought forward in <a href="3324.htm">3324</a>. </p>

</p><b>3452.</b>
`Et diximus, Sit quaeso sacramentum inter nos, inter nos et inter te, et excidamus foedus cum te': quod significet quod doctrinalia fidei eorum in se spectata non negarentur, nempe quatenus sunt ex 
sensu litterali Verbi, constat ex significatione `sacramenti inter nos' quod sit consensio doctrinalium cum sensu litterali Verbi; et a significatione `inter nos et inter te' quod sit concordantia cum 
sensu interno; et ex significatione `excidamus foedus' quod sit quod sic posset esse conjunctio; quod `foedus' sit conjunctio, videatur n. 665, 666, 1023, 1038, 1864, 2003, 2021; sensus qui inde redundat 
est quod quia ita, doctrinalia fidei eorum in se spectata non negarentur; nam, ut dictum, doctrinalia quaecumque {1}, modo sint ex Verbo, non negantur, acceptantur enim a Domino, modo is qui in illis 
est, in vita charitatis sit, nam illi vitae omnia quae Verbi sunt, conjungi possunt; sed Verbi interiora vitae quae est in charitatis interiore bono; videantur quae n. 3324 dicta et allata sunt. @1 i sint$  </p>
