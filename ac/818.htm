<h3 align="center" class="ired">属天的奥秘 第818节</h3>
<h4 align="center"></h4><p><strong>818.</strong>臀部下面有一个令人毛骨悚然的地狱，里面的人似乎用刀子互相攻击，他们象复仇的精灵（灵）那样把刀子对准别人的胸膛。不过，每当他们攻击时，刀子不断从他们手中被夺走。他们就是那些极其仇恨他人、狂怒到要将其残忍杀害的人，并由此获得了如此可怕的秉性。这个地狱为我打开（不过，由于他们恐怖的残忍行为，只打开了一点点），以便我能亲眼目睹极端仇恨的性质。</p>

<p><strong>[NCE]818.</strong> Under the buttocks is a fearsome hell where the inhabitants seem to attack each other with knives. Like furies they thrust their knives at the chests of others, but the moment they strike, the knife is always taken from them. They are individuals who hated others so much that they burned to murder them viciously. From this they drew their appalling nature.<br />The hell was opened up (but only slightly, because of their terrible cruelties) for me to see what their savage hatred was like. </p>

There is a dreadful hell beneath the buttocks, where they seem to stab one another with knives, aiming the knives at one another's breasts like furies, but in the act of striking the knife is continually 
taken away from them. They are those who have held others in such hatred that they burned to kill them cruelly; and from this they had derived a nature so direful. This hell was opened to me (but 
only a little on account of their direful cruelties), so that I might see the nature of deadly hatred. </p>

<p align="center"><b>Elliott(1983-1999) 818</b></p><p><b>818.</b>
Beneath the buttocks there is a frightful hell in which those there seem to strike one another with knives, aiming their knives at others' breasts like avenging spirits. But every time they strike the 
knife is removed from them. They are people who have hated others so much that they were inflamed to kill them in a cruel manner, and as a consequence acquired such a dreadful character. That hell has 
been opened up for me, though only slightly on account of their dreadful acts of cruelty, so that I might witness the nature of deadly hatred.  </p>

</p><b>818.</b>
Sub natibus est infernum horrendum, ubi qui ibi se cultris percutere videntur, cultros dirigentes in pectora aliorum sicut feriae, sed culter iis jugiter in ictu percussionis adimitur: sunt ii qui tanto 
odio habuerunt alios ut eos crudeliter occidere flagraverint, et inde naturam tam diram traxerant: apertum mihi hoc infernum erat, sed modo leviter ob diras eorum crudelitates, ut viderem qualia 
sunt odia internecina. </p>
