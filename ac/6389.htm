<h3 align="center" class="ired">属天的奥秘 第6389节</h3>
<h4 align="center"></h4><p><strong>6389.</strong>“是头瘦骨嶙峋的驴”表最低级的服务。这从“驴”和“骨”的含义清楚可知：“驴”是指服务（参看<a href="5958.htm">5958</a>，<a href="5959.htm">5959</a>节）；“骨”是指拥有极少属灵生命之物（<a href="5560.htm">5560</a>，<a href="5561.htm">5561</a>节）。因此，“瘦骨嶙峋的驴”表示最低级的服务；因为那些为了回报而行善的人虽履行有用的服务，或发挥功用，行事就像仆人，但他们却属在主国度中那些占据最低位置的人之列。因为除了那些能回报他们的人外，他们不将传给他们的良善施与任何人。他们忽视最需要帮助的其他人，即便帮助他们，向他们行善，也是为了能得到主的赏赐。因此，他们将自己所行的视为功德，从而视主的怜悯为他们所应得的。他们就这样远离谦卑，并且离谦卑多远，离从主经由天堂所获得的赐福和幸福就有多远。由此明显可知，在来世，这种人虽履行有用的服务或发挥功用，但却是最低级的仆人。</p>

A bony ass. That this signifies the lowest service, is evident from the signification of an "ass," as being service (see n. 5958, 5959); and from the signification of "bone," as being that which has 
little spiritual life (n. 5560, 5561). Thus a "bony ass" is the lowest service; for they who do what is good for the sake of reward, do indeed perform uses, and are of service; but yet are among those 
in the Lord's kingdom who are in the lowest place, for they do not dispense the good which is communicated to them, except to those who can recompense them; and they pass by the rest who need aid the 
most, or if they do good to these, it is from the end of being rewarded by the Lord. Hence what they do they regard as merit, and thus consider the Lord's mercy as due them. In this way they recede from 
humiliation, and in the same proportion from a state of receiving what is blessed and happy through heaven from the Lord. From all this it is evident that in the other life such are indeed employed 
in uses, but as lowest services. </p>

'Is a bony ass' means lowest-ranking service. This is clear from the meaning of 'an ass' as service, dealt with in <a href="5958.htm">5958</a>, <a href="5959.htm">5959</a>; and from the meaning of 'bone' as that which possesses little spiritual 
life, dealt with in <a href="5560.htm">5560</a>, <a href="5561.htm">5561</a>. Thus 'a bony ass' is the lowest-ranking service, for people who do good for the sake of recompense do, it is true, perform useful services and act as servants; nevertheless 
they belong among those in the Lord's kingdom who occupy the lowest position. For the good that is communicated to them they pass on to none but those who can repay them. They overlook all others 
who may be in the greatest need; or if they do help them out it is to the end that the Lord may recompense them. They look on what they do as that which earns them merit and so on the Lord's mercy as 
their due. Thus they depart from a state of humility, and to the extent that they depart from it they depart from a state in which blessing and happiness are received from the Lord through heaven. From 
all this it may be seen that in the next life such people are, it is true, engaged in the performance of useful services; but they are the lowest ranking servants. </p>

`Asinus osseus':  quod significet servitium infimum, constat ex significatione `asini' quod sit servitium, de qua n. 5958, 5959; et ex significatione `ossis' quod sit id quod parum vitae spiritualis 
habet, de qua n. 5560, 5561; ita `asinus osseus' est servitium infimum; qui enim bonum faciunt remunerationis causa, quidem {1}usus praestant ac inserviunt, sed usque sunt inter illos in regno Domini 
qui in infimo loco sunt; nam non dispensant bonum quod illis communicatur quam erga illos qui retribuere possunt; reliquos, qui opis maxime indigent, praetereunt; et si his bonum faciunt, {2}fit ex fine 
remunerationis a Domino, tunc id quod faciunt ut meritum spectant, {3}ac ita misericordiam Domini ut debitum; {4}sic recedunt ab humiliatione, et quantum ab hac tantum a statu receptionis beati et 
felicis per caelum a Domino.  Ex his constare potest quod in altera vita quidem adhibeantur ad usus sed ut servitia infima. @1 usum$ @2 est$ @3 et$ @4 ita$ </p>
