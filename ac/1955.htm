<h3 align="center" class="ired">属天的奥秘 第1955节</h3>
<h4 align="center"></h4><p><strong>1955.</strong>“因为她说，我也在这里在看见我的那一位后面看见吗”表没有以理性为媒介而进入外层人生命的流注。这从“在看见的那一位后面看见”的含义清楚可知。“在看见的那一位后面看见”就是通过内层或高层之物看见。因为就内义而言，在内或在上之物在字面上被表述为“后面”，即在内或在上之物显现于在外或在下之物后。在此说话的是夏甲，而夏甲表示属外层人的记忆知识所具有的生命，如前所示。由于第一理性源于该生命，故主看到它如此做的理由。祂通过其外层人中的内层人看到它，没有以理性为媒介。单单考虑到若非凭借内义，没人知道“在看见我的那一位后面看见”是什么意思，谁都能看出，这些话蕴含奥秘，其中也必有若非凭借诸如天使所具有的那类观念就无法解释清楚的那类事物。天使的观念不会落入话语中，只会落入话语所传达的感觉中。这与物质观念相去甚远，属话语所传达的感觉的那些观念则出于物质观念。这些事在世人看来显得极其模糊，但天使却拥有如此清楚明晰的观念，并用如此多的代表物加以充实丰富，以致有人若仅仅描述其中极小的一部分，必写满一整本书。</p>

For she said, Have I also here seen after Him who seeth me? That this signifies influx into the life of the exterior man without the rational as a medium, is evident from the signification of "seeing 
after Him that seeth." "To see after Him that seeth" is to see from what is interior, or higher, for in the internal sense that which is within or above is expressed in the sense of the letter by "after," 
when that which is within or above appears in that which is without or below. It is Hagar who speaks here; and by Hagar, as before shown, is signified the life of memory-knowledges, which belongs 
to the exterior man. As the first rational originated from this life, the Lord saw the reason for its so doing, and He saw it from His interior man in His exterior man, and did so without the rational 
as a medium. That the words before us involve arcana, everyone can see from the single consideration that no one can know what it is to "see after Him that seeth me," except from an internal sense, 
in which also there must be such things as cannot be explained to the apprehension, except by means of ideas like those of angels, which do not fall into words, but only into the sense of the words; 
and this quite apart from the material ideas out of which come the ideas of the sense of the words. Concerning the things before us, which appear so obscure to man, the angels have ideas so clear and 
distinct, and enriched with so many representations, that were only a small part of them described, they would fill a volume. </p>

'For she said, Have I not also here seen after Him who sees me?' means influx into the life of the exterior man without the rational serving as a go-between. This is clear from 'seeing after one who 
sees'. 'Seeing after one who sees' is seeing from that which is interior or higher. In the internal sense that which is inward or higher is expressed in the sense of the letter as after when what is inside 
or higher is manifesting itself in what is outward or lower. It is Hagar who is speaking here, and she, as shown already, means the life possessed by knowledge and belonging to the exterior man. 
Since it was that life from which the first rational sprang, the Lord therefore saw the reason why it did so; He saw it from His Interior Man within the Exterior Man, and without the Rational serving 
as a go-between. Anyone may see that these words embody arcana, if only from the consideration that nobody is able to know what is meant by seeing after Him who sees me except from the internal sense, 
where matters such as this are present which cannot be explained intelligibly except by means of ideas like those that angels have. These ideas do not fall into words, only into the sense conveyed by 
words - abstractedly, quite apart from the material ideas out of which the ideas come that belong to the sense conveyed by the words. These matters, which seem so obscure to man, present to the angels 
ideas so clear and distinct, ideas enriched by so many representations, that if anyone wrote about just a tiny fraction of them he would fill a whole book. </p>

`Quia dixit, Num etiam hic vidi post videntem me?': quo significet influxum in exterioris hominis vitam absque rationali medio, constat ex significatione `videre post videntem'; post videntem videre 
est ex interiore seu superiore; quod intra seu supra in sensu interno exprimitur per post in sensu litterae {1}, cum illud apparet in (c)eo quod extra vel infra est; est Hagar quae hic loquitur, per 
quam, ut prius ostensum (o)est, significatur vita scientiarum quae est exterioris hominis; quia ex illa vita ortum est rationale primum, ideo Dominus causam cur ita factum, videbat ex Interiore Suo Homine 
in exteriore, et hoc absque Rationali medio.  Quod haec involvant arcana, quisque videre potest ex eo solum quod nemo scire possit, quid sit `videre post videntem me' nisi ex sensu interno, in quo 
etiam talia sunt ut ad captum explicari nequeant nisi per ideas quales sunt angelicae, quae non cadunt in voces, solum in sensum vocum, et hoc abstracte ab ideis materialibus ex quibus ideae sensus 
vocum; de his, quae tam obscura apparent homini, habent angeli tam claras et distinctas ideas, [et] tot repraesentationibus locupletatas ut volumen scriberetur, si modo pauxillum inde describeretur. 	@1
