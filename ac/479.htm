<h4 align="center"></h4><p><strong>479.</strong>在圣言中，“取名”或“称名”表示知道事物的性质，如上所示，此处论及的是上古教会的性质，意思是：人被取于地，即被主重生，因为“亚当”一词表示“地“（ground）；当后来被造为属天时，他凭源自对主之爱的信而变成最完全的人。</p>

<p><strong>[NCE]479.</strong> In the Word, to call someone's name such-and-such or call someone by a name symbolizes a knowledge of the person's nature, as shown above [<a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_479/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_144" target=_top>144-145</a>]. Here it was the earliest church whose nature was recognized — and recognized as being that of a human taken from the ground, or in other words, regenerated by the Lord. (The word adam means "ground.") Later, when the church came to have a heavenly nature, it was recognized as being more human than others because it loved, and so believed in, the Lord. </p>
<p align="center"><b>Potts(1905-1910) 479</b></p><p><b>479.</b>
By "calling a name" or "calling by name" is signified in the Word to know the quality of things, as was shown above, and in the present case it has relation to the quality of the Most Ancient Church, 
denoting that man was taken from the ground, or regenerated by the Lord, for the word "Adam" means "ground;" and that afterwards when he was made celestial he became most eminently "Man" by virtue of 
faith originating in love to the Lord. </p>

<p align="center"><b>Elliott(1983-1999) 479</b></p><p><b>479.</b>
'Calling the name' or 'calling by name' means in the Word knowing a person's character, as shown already. Here it means knowing the character of the Most Ancient Church, which was as follows: Man was 
taken from the ground, that is, was regenerated by the Lord, for Adam is the ground; afterwards when he became celestial, he was above others Man by virtue of faith inherent in love to the Lord.  </p>

<p align="center"><b>Latin(1748-1756) 479</b>
</p><b>479.</b>
Per 'nomen vocare' seu 'nomine vocare' significatur in Verbo nosse qualis est, ut prius ostensum, hic quis esset Antiquissima Ecclesia; nempe quod Homo sumptus de humo seu regeneratus Domino, nam Adam 
est humus; et dein cum caelestis factus, quod Homo prae aliis ex fide amoris in Dominum. </p>
