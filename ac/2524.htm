<h3 align="center" class="ired">属天的奥秘 第2524节</h3>
<h4 align="center"></h4><p><strong>2524.</strong>“连她自己也说，他是我的哥哥”表理性本身声称属天的良善要与它结合。这从此处“她自己”所指的“妹子”和“哥哥”的含义清楚可知：“妹子”是指理性（<a href="1495.htm">1495</a>，<a href="2508.htm">2508</a>节）；“哥哥”（即兄弟）是指真理的良善（<a href="367.htm">367</a>，<a href="2508.htm">2508</a>节）。内中情形如下：神性良善与神性真理彼此结合，如同婚姻。天堂的婚姻，以及婚姻之爱，甚至更为低级的自然界，都由此而来。但理性的良善与真理彼此的结合不象婚姻，而象兄弟姐妹般的血缘关系。就真理而言，理性通过神性良善进入对知识和认知的情感的流注而孕育（参看<a href="1895.htm">1895</a>，<a href="1902.htm">1902</a>，<a href="1910.htm">1910</a>节），而理性的良善则经由神性良善进入这真理的流注而来，那时，这真理就变成了仁之善本身，也就是信的“兄弟”，或也可说，真理的“兄弟”（<a href="367.htm">367</a>节）。<br />关于获得理性的良善与真理的方式，理性的良善来自神性良善，但理性的真理并非来自神性真理。因为理性真理通过知识和认知获得，而知识和认知通过内外感官，因而通过外在途径被植入。因此，由感官印象造成的许多错觉就粘附于理性真理，使得这些真理不是真理。然而，当神性良善流入它们里面，并孕育它们时，它们在这种情况下则看似真理，并被承认为真理，尽管它们无非是真理的表象。那时，这些真理中的良善本身照着那里的幽暗被调节，逐渐具有和这真理一样的性质。这是隐藏在这些话里面的一个奥秘，即理性因此声称属天的良善要与它结合。</p>

And she herself also said, He is my brother. That this signifies that the rational itself dictated that celestial good should be adjoined to it, is evident from the signification of a "sister" (here 
meant by "she herself") as being the rational (n. 1495, 2508); and from the signification of a "brother," as being the good of truth (n. 367, 2508). For the case herein is as follows: Divine good and 
Divine truth are united to each other as if by marriage; for thence comes the heavenly marriage, and thence comes marriage love also, even down to lower nature. But the good and truth of the rational 
are not conjoined with each other as by marriage, but by consanguinity, like brother and sister; since the rational as to truth is conceived from the influx of Divine good into the affection of knowledges 
[scientiarum et cognitionum] (see n. 1895, 1902, 1910); and the good of the rational, through the influx of Divine good into that truth, which then becomes the good itself of charity, which is the 
"brother" of faith, or what is the same, of truth (n. 367). [2] But in regard to the good and truth of the rational, the procuring of this takes place in such a way that its good is from Divine good, 
whereas its truth is not from Divine truth; for the truth of the rational is procured by means of knowledges [scientias et cognitiones], which are insinuated through the external and internal senses, 
thus by an external way. Hence it is that there adhere to its truths many fallacies from the senses, which cause the truths not to be truths; nevertheless when Divine good flows into them, and conceives 
them, they then appear as truths, and are acknowledged as truths, although they are nothing but appearances of truth. The good itself is then modified in these truths according to the shades there, 
and becomes in quality like the truth. This is one arcanum which lies hidden in these words, that the rational thus dictated that celestial good should be adjoined to it. </p>

'She herself also said, He is my brother' means that the rational itself so declared that celestial good should be coupled with it. This becomes clear from the meaning of 'a sister', to whom 'she herself' 
refers here, as the rational, <a href="1495.htm">1495</a>, <a href="2508.htm">2508</a>, and from the meaning of 'a brother' as good that stands related to truth, <a href="367.htm">367</a>, <a href="2508.htm">2508</a>. For the implications of this are as follows: Divine Good and Divine 
Truth are united to each other as if in a marriage. From this comes the heavenly marriage, and also conjugial love, even down to the natural world below. But the good and truth of the rational are not 
joined to each other as if in a marriage but as in a blood relationship like that of brother and sister. For as regards truth, the rational is conceived from an influx of Divine Good into the affection 
for knowledge and cognitions, see <a href="1895.htm">1895</a>, <a href="1902.htm">1902</a>, <a href="1910.htm">1910</a>, whereas the good of the rational comes through an influx of Divine Good into that truth, which then becomes that good itself which belongs to charity 
and is 'the brother' of faith, or what amounts to the same, of truth, <a href="367.htm">367</a>. </p>
<p></p>
<p><b>[2]</b>
 As regards the way in which the good and truth of the rational are acquired, its good comes from Divine good, but 
not its truth from Divine truth, for the truth of the rational is acquired through knowledge and cognitions which are implanted by means of the senses, external and internal, and so by an external route. 
Consequently many illusions that result from sensory impressions cling to the truths of that rational which cause those truths not to be truths. Nevertheless when Divine Good flows into them and 
takes hold of them they are in that case seen as truths and are acknowledged as truths, even though they are no more than appearances of truth. The good itself within those truths undergoes modification 
determined by the shadows there and comes to have the same nature as the truth. This is one arcanum which lies concealed in these words, that the rational so declared that celestial good should be 
coupled with it. </p>

Quod `ipsa etiam illa dixit, Frater meus ille' significet quod ipsum rationale ita dictaret quod bonum caeleste sibi adjunctum foret, constare potest a significatione `sororis,' quae est hic `ipsa illa,' 
quod sit rationale, n. 1495, 2508; et a significatione `fratris' quod sit bonum veri, n. 367, 2508; ita enim se res habet: Divinum Bonum et Divinum Verum sibi unita sunt quasi conjugio, inde enim 
conjugium caeleste, et inde etiam, usque ad inferiorem naturam, amor conjugialis; at bonum et verum rationalis non conjuncta sunt sibi quasi conjugio, sed consanguinitate quali frater et soror; quia 
rationale quoad verum concipitur ab influxu Divini Boni in affectionem scientiarum et cognitionum, videatur n. 1895, 1902, 1910; bonum autem rationalis per influxum Divini Boni in illud verum, quod ibi 
fit ipsum bonum charitatis, quod est `frater' fidei, seu quod idem, veri n. 367. Sed cum bono et vero rationalis ita comparatum est, quod bonum ejus sit ex Bono Divino, verum autem non ex Vero Divino, 
nam verum rationalis comparatur per scientias et cognitiones quae insinuantur per sensualia externa et interna, ita per viam externam; inde est quod veris illius adhaereant ex sensualibus plures fallaciae, 
quae faciunt quod vera non sint vera; sed usque dum Divinum Bonum influit in illa et concipit illa, tunc apparent sicut vera, et agnoscuntur sicut vera, tametsi non sunt nisi quam apparentiae 
veri {1}: ipsum bonum tunc in istis veris modificatur secundum umbras ibi, et fit tale bonum, quale est verum; hoc est arcanum unum quod in his verbis latet, quod rationale ita dictaret quod bonum caeleste 
sibi adjunctum foret. 	@1 apparentia vera.$ </p>
