<h3 align="center" class="ired">属天的奥秘 第2625节</h3>
<h4 align="center"></h4><p><strong>2625.</strong>“到指定日期”表当这理性是诸如可接受的那种时。这从“日期”的含义清楚可知。人在世时有两样事物似乎必不可少，因它们是自然界的属性，那就是空间和时间。因此，活在时空中就是活在尘世或自然界中。但是，在来世，这二者是不存在的。的确，在灵人界，它们在某种程度上似乎存在。其原因在于，刚刚脱去肉身的灵人仍持守自然事物的观念。然而，不久后，他们便发觉那里没有空间和时间，取而代之的是状态；并且在来世，状态与自然界的时空相对应；存在的状态与空间相对应，彰显的状态与时间相对应。关于空间或地方，可参看前文（<a href="1274.htm">1274</a>，<a href="1379.htm">1379</a>，<a href="1380.htm">1380</a>，<a href="1382.htm">1382</a>节）。<br />谁都能由此看出，在世上或自然界时，人对来世之物和信的许多奥秘所持守的是什么样的观念；也就是说，他不愿相信它们，除非他能通过尘世物体，甚至感官经验理解它们。因为他必以为，他若脱去时空概念，尤其脱去时空本身，将完全不再是任何东西，因此，除了某种混乱和无法理解之物外，他能感觉和思维所凭借的事物就会荡然无存。然而，事情恰恰相反。天使的生活就具有这样的性质：即它是最有智慧的，也是最幸福的。<br />这就是为何在圣言中，“年纪”的内义并非表示年龄，而表示状态的原因。所以，本节“年老”并非表示年纪大。同样，数字也并非表示数字，而表示某种特定状态，如“一百岁”就是这种情况，有关它的含义，容后再述。由此可见，“到指定日期”是指当这理性是诸如可接受的那种时（就内义而言，所有这一切由“当亚伯拉罕年老的时候，撒拉怀了孕，到指定日期，就给亚伯拉罕生了一个儿子”来表示），神圣理性通过主的神性属灵之物与神性属天之物的融合而存在和彰显。有必要知道以下内容：人性始于理性的至内在部分（参看<a href="2106.htm">2106</a>，<a href="2194.htm">2194</a>节）；主朝着人性本质与神性本质，并神性本质与人性本质的融合逐渐发展（<a href="1864.htm">1864</a>，<a href="2033.htm">2033</a>，<a href="2523.htm">2523</a>节）；这一切是靠祂自己的力量（<a href="1921.htm">1921</a>，<a href="2025.htm">2025</a>，<a href="2026.htm">2026</a>，<a href="2083.htm">2083</a>节），通过不断的试探和胜利（<a href="1737.htm">1737</a>，<a href="1813.htm">1813</a>，<a href="1690.htm">1690</a>节），以及来自其神性的不断启示（<a href="1616.htm">1616</a>，<a href="2500.htm">2500</a>节）而成就的；直到最后，祂逐出来自母亲的整个人性（<a href="1414.htm">1414</a>，<a href="1444.htm">1444</a>，<a href="2574.htm">2574</a>节）；以这种方式，照出现在本节中的事物所教导的，使祂的人性（就理性而言）变成神性。由此明显可知当如何理解“当主脱去人性的日子满了，并且理性是可接受的那种时”这一解释。<br />对这个问题的概念可通过发生那些正经历重生之人身上的事形成。爱的属天之物和信的属灵之物不是立刻，而是逐渐被主植入在他们里面的；当人类理性凭这些事物而变成可接受的之时，他才第一次主要凭借他所战胜的试探而正在重生。当这些事发生时，对他来说，脱去旧人、披上新人的日子就满了（关于人的重生，可参看<a href="677.htm">677</a>，<a href="679.htm">679</a>，<a href="711.htm">711</a>，<a href="848.htm">848</a>，<a href="986.htm">986</a>，<a href="1555.htm">1555</a>，<a href="2475.htm">2475</a>节）。</p>

<p align="center"><b>Potts(1905-1910) 2625</b></p><p><b>2625.</b>
At the appointed time. That this signifies when the rational was such as to receive, is evident from the signification of "time." There are two things which while man lives in the world appear to be 
essential, because they are proper to nature, namely, space and time. Hence to live in space and time is to live in the world or in nature. But in the other life these two things are of no consequence. 
In the world of spirits indeed they do appear to be of some consequence, for the reason that spirits fresh from the body still retain the idea of natural things; yet it is not long before they perceive 
that there is no space and time there, but state instead; and that in the other life states correspond to spaces and times in nature; to spaces states as to Being [esse], and to times states as to 
Coming forth [existere]. (In regard to space or place see above, n. 1274, 1379, 1380, 1382.) [2] From this anyone can see what kind of an idea a man may have, while in the world or in nature, respecting 
the things of the other life and many arcana of faith; namely, that he is not willing to believe them until he apprehends them by means of the things in the world, nay, by sensuous things; for he 
must needs suppose that if he were to put off the idea of space and time, and still more space and time themselves, he would become absolutely nothing; and thus that he would have nothing left from which 
he could feel and think, except something confused and incomprehensible; when yet the case is exactly the reverse. Angelic life is of such a nature as to be the wisest and happiest of all. [3] This 
is the reason why in the Word "ages" in the internal sense do not signify ages, but states; so that in this verse "old age" does not mean old age. And in the same way the numbers do not signify numbers, 
but some specific state, as for instance the number a hundred years, concerning which hereafter. From this we can now see that by the "appointed time" is signified the state when the rational was 
such as to receive. [4] In regard to the specific matter here treated of, namely, that the Divine rational was and came forth from the unition of the Divine spiritual with the Divine celestial of 
the Lord, when the days were fulfilled for the human to be put off, and when the rational was such as to receive (all of which is signified in the internal sense by Sarah's conceiving and bearing to Abraham 
a son to his old age at the appointed time), be it known that the human begins in the inmost of the rational (see n. 2106, 2194); and that the Lord advanced successively to the union of the Human 
Essence with the Divine Essence, and of the Divine Essence with the Human Essence (n. 1864, 2033, 2523); and this by His own power (n. 1921, 2025, 2026, 2083), by continual temptations and victories 
(n. 1737, 1813, 1690), and by continual revelations from His Divine (n. 1616, 2500); and this until at length He had expelled all the maternal human (n. 1414, 1444, 2574); and thus had made His Human 
Divine in respect to the rational, according to the things contained in this verse. Hence it is manifest what is to be understood by the days being fulfilled for the human to be put off, and by the 
rational being such as to receive. [5] Some idea of this may be formed from what takes place in those who are being regenerated. The celestial things of love and the spiritual things of faith are not 
at once implanted in them by the Lord, but successively; and when by means of them the man's rational has become such that it can receive, then for the first time is he becoming regenerate, for the most 
part by means of temptations in which he conquers. When these things take place, the days are fulfilled for him to put off the old man, and to put on the new. (Concerning man's regeneration, see above, 
n. 677, 679, 711, 848, 986, 1555, 2475.) </p>

<p align="center"><b>Elliott(1983-1999) 2625</b></p><p><b>2625.</b>
'At the appointed time' means when the Rational was such that it was receptive. This becomes clear from the meaning of 'time'. There are two things which appear to be indispensable while a person lives 
in the world because they exist as essential elements of the natural order - those two things being space and time. Living in the world or natural order therefore is living in space and time But these 
two cease to have any existence in the next life. They do, it is true, appear to exist to some extent in the world of spirits, the reason for this being that spirits recently arrived from life in 
the body bring with them mental pictures of natural things. But subsequently they perceive that space and time do not exist in that life but states instead, and that states in the next life correspond 
to extensions of space and of time within the natural order - states in respect to Being corresponding to those of space, and in respect to Manifestation to those of time. Regarding space or place, see <a href="1274.htm">1274</a>, <a href="1379.htm">1379</a>, <a href="1380.htm">1380</a>, <a href="1382.htm">1382</a>. </p>
<p></p>
<p><b>[2]</b>
 From this anyone may see what kind of mental pictures a person is able to have while in the world or natural order regarding things which belong to the next life and 
about many arcana of faith. He may see that such a person is unwilling to believe those things unless he can take them in by means of objects that exist in the world, indeed by sensory evidence. For he 
cannot do other than suppose that if he were to divest himself of his mental pictures that have been formed from space and time, more so to divest himself of space and time themselves, he would cease 
to be anything at all and so would have nothing left to him from which he could perceive with his senses or have thoughts of anything apart from that which was unintelligible to him. But in actual fact 
quite the reverse is the case: the life of angels is such that it is the wisest and happiest of all. </p>
<p></p>
<p><b>[3]</b>
 This is the reason why people's ages mentioned in the Word do not in the internal sense 
mean ages but states, so that in this verse 'old age' does not mean old age. Nor does any number mean a number but some specific state, as in the case of 'a hundred years' mentioned further on. From this 
it now becomes clear that 'the appointed time' means the state when the rational was such that it was receptive. </p>
<p></p>
<p><b>[4]</b>
 As regards the specific teaching presented here - that the Divine Rational received 
being and was given manifestation from the Lord's Divine spiritual united to His Divine celestial, when the days had been completed for him to cast off the human and when the Rational was such 
that it was receptive (meant in the internal sense by 'Sarah conceived and bore to Abraham a son in his old age, at the appointed time') - the following needs to be known: </p>
<p> The human has its beginnings 
in the inmost part of the rational, see <a href="2106.htm">2106</a>, <a href="2194.htm">2194</a>. The Lord advanced gradually towards the union of the Human Essence with the Divine Essence, and of the Divine Essence with the Human Essence, <a href="1864.htm">1864</a>, 
<a href="2033.htm">2033</a>, <a href="2523.htm">2523</a>. </p>
<p>He did so by His own power, <a href="1921.htm">1921</a>, <a href="2025.htm">2025</a>, <a href="2026.htm">2026</a>, <a href="2083.htm">2083</a>, through continuing temptations and repeated victories, <a href="1690.htm">1690</a>, <a href="1737.htm">1737</a>, <a href="1813.htm">1813</a>, and through receiving revelations repeatedly from His own 
Divine, <a href="1616.htm">1616</a>, <a href="2500.htm">2500</a>, till at length He cast out the whole human from the mother, <a href="1414.htm">1414</a>, <a href="1444.htm">1444</a>, <a href="2574.htm">2574</a>. </p>
<p>And in this way He made His Human - as to the Rational - Divine, as taught by the things that occur 
in this verse. </p>
<p>From all this it is evident how the explanation 'when the days had been completed for Him to cast off the human and when the Rational was such that it was receptive' is to be understood. </p>
<p></p>
<p><b>[5]</b>
Some idea of this matter may be had from what happens to people who are being regenerated. The celestial things of love, and the spiritual things of faith, are instilled into them by the 
Lord not all at once but gradually; and when by means of those things a person's rational has become such that it is able to be receptive, he is for the first time becoming regenerate, mostly by means 
of temptations in which he overcomes. While these experiences are taking place the days are being completed to cast off the old man and put on the new. Regarding man's regeneration, see <a href="677.htm">677</a>, <a href="679.htm">679</a>, 
<a href="711.htm">711</a>, <a href="848.htm">848</a>, <a href="986.htm">986</a>, <a href="1555.htm">1555</a>, <a href="2475.htm">2475</a>. </p>

`Ad tempus statum': quod significet cum rationale (t)esset tale ut reciperet, constare potest a significatione `temporis': bina sunt quae dum homo vivit in mundo, apparent essentialia, quia sunt propria 
naturae, nempe `spatium' et `tempus'; inde vivere in spatio et tempore, est vivere in mundo seu {1} natura, at haec bina nulla fiunt in altera vita; apparent usque in mundo spirituum tanquam aliqua, 
ex causa quia spiritus recentes a {2} corpore ideam naturalium secum habent, sed usque dein percipiunt quod non spatium et tempus ibi sint, sed pro illis status, et quod spatiis et temporibus in natura, 
status in altera vita correspondeant; spatiis status quoad esse, et temporibus status quoad existere: de spatio aut loco videatur n. 1274, 1379, 1380, 1382: [2] inde unicuique potest evidens esse 
qualem ideam habere possit homo, dum in mundo seu natura est, de illis quae sunt alterius vitae, ac de pluribus arcanis fidei; quod non prius illis credere velit quam per illa quae sunt in mundo, immo 
per sensualia, capiat; is enim non aliter autumare potest quam si exueret ideam spatii et temporis, magis si ipsum spatium et tempus, quod prorsus nullus fieret, et sic quod ei nihil residuum foret 
ex quo sentire et cogitare posset, nisi quoddam confusum incomprehensibile; cum tamen prorsus contrarium est; angelica vita est talis, quae omnium sapientissima et felicissima.  [3] Haec causa at quod 
per `aetates' in Verbo non significentur in sensu interno aetates sed status, ita in hoc versu per `senectutem' non senectus; tum quod per `numeros' non numeri, sed quidam status in specie, ut per 
numerum `centum annorum' de quo in sequentibus: ex his nunc constare potest quod per {3} `tempus statum' significetur status cum rationale tale esset ut reciperet.  [4] Quod ipsam rem attinet, nempe, 
quod esset et existeret ex unitione Divini spiritualis cum Divino caelesti Domini, Divinum Rationale, cum dies completi essent ut exueretur humanum, et cum rationale tale esset ut reciperet, quae in sensu 
interno significantur per `concepit et peperit Sarah Abrahamo filium senectuti illius, ad tempus statum,' sciendum quod in intima rationalis incipiat humanum, videatur n. 2106, 2194; et quod Dominus 
successive progressus sit ad unionem Humanae Essentiae cum Divina, (c)et Divinae cum Humana, n. 1864, 2033, 2523 et hoc propria potentia, n. 1921, 2025, 2026, 2083: per continuas tentationes et victorias

fecerit, secundum illa quae in hoc versu: inde patet quomodo intelligendum, cum dies completi sunt ut exueretur humanum et cum rationale tale esset ut reciperet: [5] aliqua idea ejus rei haberi 
potest ex illis quae fiunt apud eos qui regenerantur; caelestia quae sunt amoris et spiritualia quae sunt fidei, non simul sed successive illis implantantur a Domino, et cum per illa rationale hominis 
tale factum est ut recipere possit, tunc primum regeneratur, ut plurimum per tentationes in quibus vincit; haec dum fiunt, sunt dies completi ut exuat veterem hominem (c)et induat novum; de regeneratione
