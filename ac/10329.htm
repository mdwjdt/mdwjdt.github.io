<h3 align="center" class="ired">属天的奥秘 第10329节</h3>
<h4 align="center"></h4><p><strong>10329</strong>.“看，我已经按名召犹大支派中户珥的孙子，乌利的儿子比撒列”表那些处于爱之良善的人，教会将在他们当中建立。这从“按名召”的含义和“比撒列”的代表清楚可知：“按名召”是指选择这样的人，即合适的人选，如下文所述；“比撒列”是指那些处于爱之良善的人。比撒列在此之所以代表这些人，是因为他来自犹大支派，而该支派表示那些处于属天良善，也就是对主之爱的良善之人，在从人抽象出来的意义上表示属天之爱的良善。关于犹大及其支派的这层含义，可参看前文（<a href="3654.htm">3654</a>，<a href="3881.htm">3881</a>，<a href="6363.htm">6363</a>，<a href="6364.htm">6364</a>，<a href="8770.htm">8770</a>节）。至于比撒列的父亲乌利和祖父户珥代表什么，这从属天良善的产生方式清楚看出来。它是从属天层面的真理和良善的教义产生的。所以这两个人表示这些教义，“户珥”代表真理的教义（参看<a href="9424.htm">9424</a>节）。<br />那些只专注于圣言字义，并且在历史部分比在先知书部分更专注字义的人当被告知，这两个人的名字表示这类事物时，可能会感到很惊讶；但那些熟悉圣言本质的人则不会吃惊。因为圣言在每个细节上都拥有属灵之物。实际的人名和地名里面没有任何属灵之物，除非它们用来表示教会和天堂的真实事物；因为这些事物是属灵的。由此可推知，此处这两个名字同样表示属灵事物。圣言中的名字用来表示属灵事物或真实事物（参看<a href="1224.htm">1224</a>，<a href="1264.htm">1264</a>，<a href="1888.htm">1888</a>，<a href="4442.htm">4442</a>，<a href="5095.htm">5095</a>，<a href="5225.htm">5225</a>，<a href="6516.htm">6516</a>节）；这些名字不会进入天堂，只有它们所表示的真实事物才能进入（<a href="1876.htm">1876</a>，<a href="10216.htm">10216</a>，<a href="10282.htm">10282</a>节）。<br />“按名召”之所以表示选择这样的合适人选，是因为“名”在不考虑一个实际的人的情况下，表示某种事物的本质或品质，这一点从圣言中提到“名”的地方可以看出来。“名”表示某种事物的本质或品质（参看<a href="144.htm">144</a>，<a href="145.htm">145</a>，<a href="1754.htm">1754</a>，<a href="1896.htm">1896</a>，<a href="2009.htm">2009</a>，<a href="2724.htm">2724</a>，<a href="3004.htm">3004</a>-<a href="3011.htm">3011</a>，<a href="3421.htm">3421</a>，<a href="6674.htm">6674</a>，<a href="6887.htm">6887</a>，<a href="8274.htm">8274</a>，<a href="8882.htm">8882</a>，<a href="9310.htm">9310</a>节）；没有“名”这个名词的动词“召”具有相信的含义（<a href="3421.htm">3421</a>，<a href="3659.htm">3659</a>节）；而“按名召”表示选择（<a href="8773.htm">8773</a>节）。<br />耶和华在此按名召这两个人，即犹大支派的比撒列和但支派的亚何利亚伯，去执行在西乃山上吩咐给摩西的工作。“比撒列”表示那些处于属天之爱的良善之人，“亚何利亚伯”表示那些处于信之良善和真理的人。那些处于属天之爱的良善之人在天堂和教会的至内在部分，而那些处于信之良善和真理的人则在它们的末后和最低部分。因此，这两个人表示教会能建在其中的整体上的所有人；因为首先的和末后的，或最内层和最外层表示所有人或所有事物。因为接下来论述的主题是将要建立的教会；这就是为何经上按名提到这两人，他们表示教会能建在其中的所有人。“首先的和末后的”表示所有人和所有事物（<a href="10044.htm">10044</a>节）；“但支派的亚何利亚伯”表示那些处于信之良善的人，因而表示那些在天堂或教会的末后和最低部分的人，可参看下文。由此明显可知，“我已经按名召犹大支派中户珥的孙子，乌利的儿子比撒列”表示那些处于爱之良善的人，教会将在他们当中建立。</p>

<p align="center"><b>Potts(1905-1910) 10329</b></p><p><b>10329.</b>
See, I have called by name Bezalel, the son of Uri, the son of Hur, of the tribe of Judah. That this signifies those who are in the good of love and with whom the church was about to be set up, is evident 
from the signification of "calling by name," as being to choose such, namely, as are suitable (of which below); and from the representation of Bezalel, as being those who are in the good of love. 
That these are here represented by Bezalel, is because he was of the tribe of Judah, and by this tribe are signified those who are in celestial good, which is the good of love to the Lord; and in a 
sense abstracted from persons, the good of celestial love. (That this is signified by "Judah" and his tribe, see n. 3654, 3881, 6363, 6364, 8770.) But what is represented by Uri the father of Bezalel, 
and by Hur his grandfather, is evident from the generation of celestial good. This is generated from the doctrine of celestial truth and good, and therefore by these persons are signified these doctrines. 
(That by Hur is represented the doctrine of truth, see n. 9424.) [2] They who keep the mind only in the sense of the letter of the Word, which is done in the historic parts more intently than in 
the prophetic, may wonder that it is said that such things are signified by the names of these men. But those will not wonder who are acquainted with the nature of the Word, for there is what is spiritual 
in each and all things. In the very names of the persons and places in the Word there is nothing spiritual unless they signify real things of the church and of heaven, for these things are spiritual, 
and therefore it follows that even by these names spiritual things are signified. (That the names in the Word signify real things, see n. 1224, 1264, 1888, 4442, 5095, 5225, 6516; and that these 
names do not enter heaven, but the things which are signified, n. 1876, 10216, 10282.)  [3] That "to call by name" denotes to choose such as are suitable, is because by a name apart from the person 
is signified the quality, as can be seen from the passages in the Word where "name" is mentioned. (That by "name" is signified quality, see n. 144, 145, 1754, 1896, 2009, 2724, 3004-3011, 3421, 6674, 
6887, 8274, 8882, 9310; and likewise by "calling," without a name, n. 3421, 3659; and that "to call by name" denotes to choose, n. 8773.) [4] Two men are here named who were called by Jehovah to do the 
works commanded to Moses on Mount Sinai, namely, Bezalel of the tribe of Judah, and Aholiab of the tribe of Dan. By "Bezalel" are signified those who are in the good of celestial love, and by "Aholiab" 
those who are in the good and truth of faith. Those who are in the good of celestial love are in the inmost of heaven and of the church; and those who are in the good and truth of faith are in the 
outermost thereof. Thus by these two are signified all in the complex with whom the church can be set up; for by the first and the last, or by the inmost and the outermost, are signified all persons 
or all things. For in what now follows the subject treated of is the setting up of the church, and therefore these two are named, by whom are signified all with whom the church can be set up. (That by 
"the first and the last" are signified all persons and all things, n. 10044; and that by "Aholiab of the tribe of Dan" are signified those who are in the good of faith, will be seen in what follows.) 
From all this it is now evident that by, "I have called by name Bezalel the son of Uri, the son of Hur, of the tribe of Judah," are signified those who are in the good of love, with whom the church 
was to be set up. </p>

<p align="center"><b>Elliott(1983-1999) 10329</b></p><p><b>10329.</b>
'See, I have called by name Bezalel the son of Uri, the son of Hur, belonging to the tribe of Judah' means those in whom the good of love is present, among whom the Church is to be established. This 
is clear from the meaning of 'calling by name' as choosing such persons, that is to say, ones who are suitable, dealt with below; and from the representation of 'Bezalel' as those in whom the good of 
love is present. The reason why these are represented here by Bezalel is that he came from the tribe of Judah, and this tribe means those in whom celestial good is present, which is the good of love to 
the Lord, and in the abstract sense, without reference to persons, it means the good of celestial love. For this meaning of Judah and his tribe, see <a href="3654.htm">3654</a>, <a href="3881.htm">3881</a>, <a href="6363.htm">6363</a>, <a href="6364.htm">6364</a>, <a href="8770.htm">8770</a>. But what Uri and Hur, 
Bezalel's father and grandfather, represent is clear from the manner in which celestial good is begotten. It is begotten by teachings that present what is true and good on a celestial level. So those 
teachings are meant by these two men, 'Hur' representing teachings that present the truth, see <a href="9424.htm">9424</a>.  </p>
<p></p>
<p><b>[2]</b>
 People who keep their minds fixed solely on the literal sense of the Word, which they do 
more resolutely in the historical sections than in the prophetical parts, may be astonished when they are told that such things are meant by the names of those two men; but people who are acquainted 
with the essential nature of the Word will not be astonished. For in every detail the Word has a spiritual content. Within the actual names of persons and places that are mentioned in the Word there would 
be nothing spiritual if they did not serve to mean things of the Church and of heaven; for those things are spiritual. From this it follows that the two names used here likewise mean spiritual things. 
 </p>
<p>Names in the Word serve to mean spiritual things or realities, see <a href="1224.htm">1224</a>, <a href="1264.htm">1264</a>, <a href="1888.htm">1888</a>, <a href="4442.htm">4442</a>, <a href="5095.htm">5095</a>, <a href="5225.htm">5225</a>, <a href="6516.htm">6516</a>.  Names do not pass into heaven, only the realities meant by them, <a href="1876.htm">1876</a>, <a href="10216.htm">10216</a>, <a href="10282.htm">10282</a>. 
 </p>
<p></p>
<p><b>[3]</b>
 The reason why 'calling by name' in the spiritual sense means choosing such persons as are suitable is that the word 'name' considered without reference to an actual person means the essential 
nature of something, as becomes clear from places in the Word in which 'name' occurs.  </p>
<p>'Name' means the essential nature of something, see <a href="144.htm">144</a>, <a href="145.htm">145</a>, <a href="1754.htm">1754</a>, <a href="1896.htm">1896</a>, <a href="2009.htm">2009</a>, <a href="2724.htm">2724</a>, <a href="3004.htm">3004</a>-<a href="3011.htm">3011</a>, <a href="3421.htm">3421</a>, <a href="6674.htm">6674</a>, <a href="6887.htm">6887</a>, <a href="8274.htm">8274</a>, <a href="8882.htm">8882</a>, <a href="9310.htm">9310</a>.  The verb 'call' without the noun 'name' has a similar meaning, <a href="3421.htm">3421</a>, <a href="3659.htm">3659</a>, while 'calling by name' means choosing, <a href="8773.htm">8773</a>.  </p>
<p></p>
<p><b>[4]</b>
 Two men are named here who were called 
by Jehovah to carry out the work that Moses was commanded on Mount Sinai - Bezalel from the tribe of Judah, and Aholiab from the tribe of Dan. 'Bezalel' means those in whom the good of celestial love 
is present, 'Aholiab' those in whom the good and truth of faith exist. Those in whom the good of celestial love is present are in the inmost part of heaven and the Church, whereas those in whom the good 
and truth of faith exist are in the last and lowest part of them. Thus these two men mean all persons in their entirety among whom the Church may be established; for the first and the last, or the 
inmost and the outermost, mean all persons or all things. For the subject in what immediately follows is the Church that is to be established; and this is why these two, by whom are meant all among whom 
the Church could be established, are mentioned by name. For the meaning of the first and the last as all persons and all things, see <a href="10044.htm">10044</a>; and for that of Aholiab from the tribe of Dan as those in 
whom the good of faith exists, and so who are in the last and lowest part of heaven or the Church, see in what follows below.  </p>
<p>From all this it now evident that 'I have called by name Bezalel the 
son of Uri, the son of Hur, belonging to the tribe of Judah' means those in whom the good of love is present, among whom the Church is to be established.  </p>

`Vide vocavi nomine (x)Bezaleelem filium Uri filii Churi tribui Jehudae': quod significet illos qui in bono amoris sunt, apud quos Ecclesia instauranda, constat ex significatione `vocare nomine' quod

intentius quam in propheticis, illi mirari possunt quod dicatur quod per nomina illorum virorum talia significentur; sed qui sciunt quod Verbum est, non miraturi sunt; est enim spirituale in omnibus

10,282. 	[3] Quod `vocare nomine' in sensu spirituali sit eligere tales qui idonei, est quia per `nomen' absque persona significatur quale {4}, ut constare potest ex locis in Verbo ubi `nomen' dicitur; 
quod per `nomen' significetur quale, videatur n. 144, 145, 1754, 1896, 2009, 2724, 3004-3011, 3421, 6674, 6887, 8274, 8882, 9310, et quod per `vocare' absque nomine similiter, n. 3421, 3659, et quod
