<p><strong>[NCE]634.</strong> It is tremendously difficult to explain comprehensibly what an understanding of truth and a will to do good are, in the strict sense. The reason for the difficulty is that we consider every thought passing through our minds to be part of our intellect (since that is the name we give it) and every desire entering our heart to be part of our will (since that is the name we give it).<br />What makes a clear explanation even harder is that many people today are also completely unable to tell the difference between activity in the intellect and activity in the will. When they think something, they say they want it, and when they want something, they say they think it. So again the obstacle is the labels people use.<br />Yet another barrier to comprehension is the fact that only what relates to their body captures people's interest; that is, their lives are exceedingly shallow.<br />[2] For all these reasons, people are unaware that each of us has a deeper level inside, and another level deeper than that, and another level that is deepest of all. They do not see that our bodily urges and sense impressions form the outermost surface; our passions and memorized knowledge, a deeper layer; our loves and rational thoughts, a still deeper layer; and a will to do good and a comprehension of truth, the deepest. These levels are differentiated from one another with the greatest possible clarity. Body-centered people, however, jumble them all together into an undifferentiated whole. This is the source of the belief that when our physical part dies, everything else must too, even though it is at death that we first start to live. Indeed the new life comes to us by way of our inner levels, passing through each level in order.<br />If our inner dimensions were not clearly distinguished in this way, and if they did not lie one within the other, in the next life we could never become spirits, never become angelic spirits, never become angels. These three groups are differentiated in the same way as the inner levels, which create the plainest demarcation possible among the three heavens.<br />This explanation casts a little light on what a comprehension of truth and a will to do good are, properly speaking, and shows that they can be ascribed only to a person whose character is heavenly, or to angels in the third heaven. </p>

But it is extremely difficult to say, in a manner to be apprehended, what is the understanding of truth and the will of good in the proper sense, for the reason that a man supposes everything he thinks 
to be of the understanding, since he calls it so; and everything that he desires he supposes to be of the will, since he calls it so. And it is the more difficult to explain this so as to be apprehended, 
because most men at this day are also ignorant of the fact that what is of the understanding is distinct from what is of the will, for when they think anything they say they will it, and when they 
will a thing they say they think it. This is one cause of the difficulty, and another reason why this subject can with difficulty be comprehended is that men are solely in what is of the body, that 
is, their life is in the most external things. [2] And for these reasons they do not know that there is in every man something that is interior, and something still interior to that, and indeed an inmost; 
and that his corporeal and sensuous part is only the outermost. Desires, and things of the memory, are interior; affections and rational things are interior still to these; and the will of good 
and understanding of truth are inmost. And these are so distinct from each other that nothing can ever be more distinct. The corporeal man makes all these into a one, and confounds them. This is why 
he believes that when his body dies all things are to die; though in fact he then first begins to live, and this by his interiors following one another closely in their order. If his interiors were not 
thus distinct, and did not thus succeed each other, men could never be in the other life spirits, angelic spirits, and angels, who are thus distinguished according to their interiors. For this reason 
there are three heavens, most distinct from each other. From these considerations it may now in some measure be evident what, in the proper sense, are the understanding of truth and the will of good; 
and that they can be predicated only of the celestial man, or of the angels of the third heaven. </p>

<p align="center"><b>Elliott(1983-1999) 634</b></p><p><b>634.</b>
It is extremely difficult however to state intelligibly what the understanding of truth and the will for good are, properly speaking. The reason is that everything man thinks he ascribes to the understanding 
because he calls it so, and everything he desires he ascribes to the will because he calls it so. And it is even more difficult to state what they are in an intelligible way because the majority 
nowadays are also unaware that what belongs to the understanding is distinct and separate from what belongs to the will; for when they think something they say that they will it, and when they will 
something they say that they think it. Their speaking in this way is thus one reason for the difficulty. And a further reason why it is difficult to grasp the matter is that such people are engrossed 
solely in bodily interests, that is, their life consists in things of a more external nature. </p>
<p></p>
<p><b>[2]</b>
 For these same reasons people are also unaware of the fact that with everybody there exists something 
interior, something more interior still, and indeed something inmost, and that the bodily and sensory part of a person is the most external. Desires and things of the memory are interior, affections 
and rational concepts more interior still, while the will for good and the understanding of truth are the inmost. Nothing could possibly be more distinct and separate than these are from one another, 
yet a bodily-minded man sees no difference at all, and so confuses them all with one another. This is the reason why he believes that when his physical body dies, everything else will die as well, 
when in reality only at that point does he start to live, and to do so indeed through his own interior things which are arranged in consecutive order. Unless man's interior things were distinct and separate 
in this way and arranged consecutively, men could not possibly be spirits, angelic spirits, or angels in the next life, all of whom differ in this way from one another according to things that 
are interior. Consequently the three heavens are very distinct and separate from one another. From all these considerations it now becomes clear to some extent what the understanding of truth and the 
will for good are, properly speaking, and that they are attributable only to the celestial man, or angels of the third heaven. </p>

Sed perquam difficile est ad captum dicere, quid intellectus veri et voluntas boni in proprio sensu, ex causa quod omne quod cogitat homo, putet esse intellectus, quia ita id appellat; et omne quod 
cupit, putet esse voluntatis, quia ita id appellat: eoque difficilius est dicere ad captum quia plerique hodie quoque ignorant quod intellectuale sit distinctum a voluntario; nam cum cogitant quid, dicunt 
se velle, et cum volunt quid, dicunt se cogitare, ita quoque ex causa quod ita appellent: praeterea causa est quod difficile comprehendi possit, quia in corporeis solum sunt, seu vita eorum in extremis: 
[2] ex his causis ignorant quoque quod interius quoddam, et adhuc interius, immo intimum detur apud unumquemvis hominem; et quod corporeum ejus et sensuale sit extremum; cupiditates et res memoriae 
sint interiora; affectiones et rationalia sint adhuc interiora; et voluntas boni ac intellectus veri sint intima; et haec ita distincta inter se ut nihil usquam distinctius; corporeus homo omnia 
haec unum facit, et confundit; quae causa est quod credat, cum moritur corporeum ejus etiam omnia moritura esse, cum tamen tunc primum incipit vivere et quidem per interiora sua ordine succedentia; nisi 
interiora ejus ita distincta essent, et sibi succederent, nusquam potuissent homines in altera vita esse spiritus, esse spiritus angelici, esse angeli, qui distinguuntur ita secundum interiora; inde 
tres caeli inter se distinctissimi. Ex his nunc aliquantum constare potest quid intellectu veri et voluntas boni in proprio sensu, et quod solum praedicari queant de homine caelesti, seu de angelis 
tertii caeli. </p>
