Verses 9-13. And spoke the prince of the butlers unto Pharaoh, saying, I do remember my sins this day. Pharaoh was wroth upon his servants, and put me in custody in the house of the prince of the guards, 
me and the prince of the bakers: and we dreamed a dream in one night, I and he; we dreamed each one according to the interpretation of his dream. And there was with us there a Hebrew boy, servant 
to the prince of the guards; and we told him, and he interpreted to us our dreams; to each one according to his dream he did interpret. And it came to pass, as he interpreted to us, so it was; me he 
brought back upon my station, and him he hanged. "And spoke the prince of the butlers unto Pharaoh," signifies thought from the sensuous subject to the intellectual part; "saying," signifies perception 
therefrom; "I do remember my sins this day," signifies about a state of disjunction; "Pharaoh was wroth upon his servants," signifies when the natural turned itself away; "and put me in custody in the 
house of the prince of the guards," signifies rejection by the things that are primary for interpretation; "me and the prince of the bakers," signifies both sensuous parts; "and we dreamed a dream 
in one night," signifies what was foreseen in obscurity; "I and he," signifies concerning both sensuous parts; "we dreamed each one according to the interpretation of his dream," signifies what would 
be the event to both; "and there was with us there a Hebrew boy," signifies that because of temptation the guiltlessness of the church was rejected thither; "servant to the prince of the guards," signifies 
wherein was truth that might serve primarily for interpretation; "and we told him," signifies that there was perception therefrom; "and he interpreted to us our dreams," signifies what was in the 
things foreseen in obscurity; "to each one according to his dream he did interpret," signifies from truth; "and it came to pass, as he interpreted to us, so it was," signifies that such was the event; 
"me he brought back upon my station," signifies that the sensuous of the intellectual part was received; "and him he hanged," signifies that the sensuous of the will part was rejected. </p>

Verses 9-13 And the chief of the cupbearers spoke to Pharaoh, saying, I remember my sins today. Pharaoh was incensed with his servants, and put me into custody in the house of the chief of the attendants, 
me and the chief of the bakers. And we dreamed a dream in one night, I and he; we dreamed each according to the interpretation of his own dream. And a Hebrew boy was there with us, a servant to 
the chief of the attendants; and we told him, and he interpreted our dreams for us; to each according to his dream he gave the interpretation. And it happened, that as he interpreted to us, so it came 
about. He restored me to my position, and he hanged him. </p>
<p>'And the chief of the cupbearers spoke to Pharaoh' means thought formed by the sensory power subject to the understanding part of the mind. 
'Saying' means the perception resulting from this. 'I remember my sins today' means regarding a state of separation. 'Pharaoh was incensed with his servants' means when the natural turned away. 'And 
put me into custody in the house of the chief of the attendants' means a casting aside from what exists first and foremost in explanations. 'Me and the chief of the bakers' means both kinds of sensory 
power. 'And we dreamed a dream in one night' means that which was foreseen in obscurity. 'I and he' means regarding both kinds of sensory power. 'We dreamed each according to the interpretation of his 
own dream' means what was to be the outcome of both. 'And a Hebrew boy was there with us' means that owing to temptation the guiltlessness of the Church had been cast away there. 'A servant of the chief 
of the attendants' means in which there was truth that served that which came first and foremost in explanations. 'And we told him' means resulting perception. 'And he interpreted our dreams for 
us' means what the things foreseen in obscurity held within them. 'To each according to his dream he gave the interpretation' means from [a knowledge of] the truth. 'And it happened, that as he interpreted 
to us, so it came about' means that so was the outcome. 'He restored me to my position' means that the sensory power belonging to the understanding part of the mind was accepted. 'And he hanged 
him' means that the sensory power belonging to the will part was cast aside. </p>

Vers. 9-13.  Et locutus princeps pincernarum cum Pharaone, dicendo, Peccatorum meorum ego recordor hodie.  Pharaoh succensuit super servos suos, et dedit me in custodiam domo principis satellitum, me 
et principem pistorum.  Et somniavimus somnium in nocte una, ego et is, quisque secundum interpretationem somnii sui somniavimus.  Et ibi cum nobis puer Hebraeus servus {1}principis satellitum, et narravimus 
ei, et interpretatus nobis somnia nostra, cuique secundum somnium (x)suum interpretatus.  Et factum, quemadmodum interpretatus nobis, ita fuit, me reduxit super stationem meam, et eum suspendit. 
 `Et locutus princeps pincernarum cum Pharaone' significat cogitationem ex sensuali parti intellectuali subjecto:  `dicendo' significat perceptionem inde: `Peccatorum meorum {2} recordor hodie' significat 
de disjunctionis statu:  `Pharaoh succensuit super servos suos' significat cum naturale se averteret:  `et dedit me in custodiam domo principis satellitum' significat rejectionem ab illis quae 
primaria interpretationi:  `me et principem pistorum' significat utrumque sensuale:  `et somniavimus somnium in nocte una' significat praevisum in obscuro:  `ego et is' significat de utroque sensuali: 
`quisque secundum interpretationem somnii sui somniavimus' significat quid eveniret utrique:  `et ibi cum nobis puer Hebraeus' significat quod tentationis causa illuc rejectum insons Ecclesiae: `servus 
principis satellitum' significat in quo verum quod primario inserviret interpretationi:  `et narravimus ei' significat quod inde perceptio:  `et interpretatus nobis somnia nostra' significat quid 
inesset praevisis in obscuro:  `cuique secundum somnium suum interpretatus' significat ex vero:  `et factum, quemadmodum interpretatus nobis, ita fuit' significat quod sic eveniret:  `me reduxit super 
stationem meam' significat quod sensuale partis intellectualis reciperetur:  `et eum suspendit' significat quod sensuale partis voluntariae rejiceretur. @1 Thus A I here and 5237, but see p. 4$ @2
