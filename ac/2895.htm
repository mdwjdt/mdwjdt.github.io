<h3 align="center" class="ired">属天的奥秘 第2895节</h3>
<h4 align="center"></h4><p><strong>2895.</strong>关于具体上的圣言，每个时代都有圣言，不过，它并非我们现在所拥有的圣言。大洪水前的上古教会另有一本圣言，而大洪水后的古教会则又有一本圣言。后来的圣言是由犹太教会的摩西和众先知所写的，最后的圣言则是由新教会的福音作者们所写的。每个时代都有一本圣言，其原因在于，天与地凭圣言相通，还因为圣言论述良善与真理，而人凭良善与真理能幸福生活到永远。因此，就内义而言，圣言唯独论述主，因为一切良善与真理皆源于祂。</p>

As regards the Word specifically, it had existed in all times, but not the Word which we have at this day. There had been another Word in the Most Ancient Church which was before the flood, and another 
Word in the Ancient Church which was after the flood; then came the Word written by Moses and the prophets in the Jewish Church; and lastly the Word that was written by the Evangelists in the new church. 
The reason why there has been a Word at all times, is that by the Word there is communication of heaven with earth; and also because the Word treats of good and truth, from which man is to live 
happy forever; and on this account in the internal sense it treats of the Lord alone, because all good and truth are from Him. </p>

As regards the Word particularly, it has existed in every age, though not the Word we possess at the present day. Another Word existed in the Most Ancient Church before the Flood, and yet another Word 
in the Ancient Church after the Flood. Then came the Word written through Moses and the Prophets in the Jewish Church, and finally the Word written through the Evangelists in the new Church. The reason 
why the Word has existed in every age is that by means of the Word there is a communication between heaven and earth, and also that the Word deals with goodness and truth, by which a person is enabled 
to live in eternal happiness. In the internal sense therefore the Lord alone is the subject, for all goodness and truth are derived from Him. </p>

</p><b>2895.</b>
Quod Verbum in specie attinet, hoc fuerat omni tempore, sed non Verbum quod hodie habemus; aliud Verbum fuerat in Ecclesia Antiquissima quae ante diluvium; aliud Verbum in Ecclesia Antiqua quae post 
diluvium; Verbum autem scriptum per Mosen et prophetas in Ecclesia Judaica; et denique Verbum scriptum per evangelistas in Ecclesia nova.  Quod omni tempore fuerit Verbum, erit quia per Verbum est communicatio 
caeli cum terra, et quia Verbum agit de bono et vero, ex quo homo victurus felix in aeternum; et ideo in sensu interno agit de solo Domino, quia ex Ipso omne bonum et verum. </p>
