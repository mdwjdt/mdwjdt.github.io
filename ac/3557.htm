<h3 align="center" class="ired">属天的奥秘 第3557节</h3>
<h4 align="center"></h4><p><strong>3557.</strong>创世记27:21-23.以撒对雅各说，我儿，你近前来，我摸摸你，看你真是我的儿子以扫不是。雅各就挨近他父亲以撒。以撒摸着他说，声音是雅各的声音，手却是以扫的手。以撒就辨不出他来，因为他手上有毛，像他哥哥以扫的手一样，就给他祝福。<br />“以撒对雅各说”表对于这属世层的直觉。“我儿，你近前来，我摸摸你”表出于它在场的至内在的直觉。“看你真是我的儿子以扫不是”表它不是属世良善。“雅各就挨近他父亲以撒”表在场的状态。“以撒摸着他”表由此而来的全部直觉。“说，声音是雅各的声音，手却是以扫的手”表在这种情况下，理解力部分由在里面的真理构成，而意愿部分则由在外面的良善构成，因此它们具有颠倒的次序。“以撒就辨不出他来，因为他手上有毛，像他哥哥以扫的手一样”表他通过在外面的意愿发觉它是属世良善。“就给他祝福”表由此产生的结合。</p>

Verses 21-23. And Isaac said unto Jacob, Come near I pray, and I will feel thee my son, whether thou be my very son Esau, or not. And Jacob came near to Isaac his father; and he felt him, and said, The 
voice is Jacob's voice, but the hands are the hands of Esau. And he recognized him not, because his hands were hairy like his brother Esau's hands; and he blessed him. "And Isaac said unto Jacob," 
signifies perception concerning this natural; "come near I pray, and I will feel thee my son," signifies inmost perception from presence; "whether thou be my very son Esau, or not," signifies that it 
was not natural good; "and Jacob came near to Isaac his father," signifies a state of presence; "and he felt him," signifies thence all perception; "and said, The voice is Jacob's voice, but the hands 
are the hands of Esau," signifies that in this case the intellectual part is of truth which is within, but the will part is of good which is without, thus they are of inverted order; "and he recognized 
him not, because his hands were hairy as his brother Esau's hands," signifies that from the will part that was without it was perceived that it was natural good; "and he blessed him," signifies the 
consequent conjunction. </p>

Verses 21-23 And Isaac said to Jacob, Come near now, and I will feel you, my son, whether you are my son Esau, or not. And Jacob came near to Isaac his father; and he felt him, and said, The voice is 
Jacob's voice, and the hands Esau's hands. And he did not recognize him because his hands were hairy like the hands of Esau his brother; and he blessed him. </p>
<p>'Isaac said to Jacob' means perception 
concerning this natural. 'Come near now, and I will feel you, my son' means inmost perception from its presence. 'Whether you are my son Esau, or not' means that it was not natural good. 'And Jacob came 
near to Isaac his father' means a state of being present. 'And he felt him' means complete perception from this. 'And said, The voice is Jacob's voice, and the hands Esau's hands' means that the understanding 
consists in this case of truth existing inwardly, while the will consists in this case of good existing outwardly, so that an inversion of order exists with them. 'And he did not recognize 
him because his hands were hairy like the hands of Esau his brother' means that from the will which occupied an external position he perceived that it was natural good. 'And he blessed him' means resulting 
conjunction </p>

Vers. 21-23. Et dixit Jishak ad Jacobum, Accede quaeso, et palpabo te, fili mi, an tu is filius meus Esau, si non. Et accessit Jacob ad Jishakum patrem suum, et palpavit illum, et dixit, Vox vox Jacobi, 
et manus manus Esavi. Et non agnovit illum, quia erant manus ejus sicut manus Esavi fratris ejus pilosae; et benedixit illi. `Dixit Jishak ad Jacobum' significat perceptionem de naturali hoc: `Accede 
quaeso, et palpabo te, fili mi' significat perceptionem (c)a praesentia intimam: an tu is filius meus Esau, si non' significat quod non esset bonum naturale: `et accessit Jacob ad Jishakum patrem 
suum' significat praesentiae statum: `et palpavit illum' significat inde perceptionem omnem: `et dixit, Vox vox Jacobi, et manus manus Esavi' significat quod intellectuale ibi sit veri quod intus, sed 
voluntarium ibi sit boni quod extus, ita inversi ordinis: `et non agnovit illum, quia erant manus ejus sicut manus Esavi fratris ejus pilosae' significat quod ex voluntario quod extus, perciperet quod 
esset bonum naturale: `et benedixit illi' significat inde conjunctionem. </p>
