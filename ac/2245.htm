<h3 align="center" class="ired">属天的奥秘 第2245节</h3>
<h4 align="center"></h4><p><strong>2245.</strong>“那些人从那里观看”表主出于神性的思维。这多“观看”和“那些人”的含义清楚可知：“观看”是指思考，因为“看”在内义上如同日常用语那样，是指理解力，理解力就是内视（即内在视觉），因而“观看”表示思考，思考是内视或理解力的活动；“那些人”则是指神性。本章有时提到“那些人”，有时提到“耶和华”，以取代“那些人”。当提到“那些人”时，所表示的是三位一体，即神性本身、神性人和（神圣）活动。“那些人从那里观看”表示主出于这神性的思维。这思维来自与神性联结的人性，本章一开始论述了这种联结。但思维所源自的直觉则来自神性，因此同样在这一节，经上提到了“耶和华”，即“亚伯拉罕仍旧站在耶和华面前”。当人性被联结于神性时，（神圣）活动也与它们在一起。</p>

The men looked forth thence. That this signifies the Lord's thought from the Divine, is evident from the signification of "looking forth," as being to think (for to "see," in the internal sense, as in 
common discourse, is to understand, since understanding is internal sight, and in the same way to "look forth" is to think, which is of the internal sight, that is, of the understanding); and also from 
the signification of "the men," as being the Divine. In this chapter throughout mention is sometimes made of "the men," and sometimes of  "Jehovah" instead of "the men:" when mention is made of "the 
men" there is signified a Trine, namely, the Divine Itself, the Divine Human, and the Proceeding. The Lord's thought from this Divine is signified by "the men looked forth thence." The thought was 
from the Human conjoined with the Divine, which conjunction was treated of at the beginning of this chapter; but the perception from which came the thought was from the Divine, therefore mention is now 
made in this same verse of "Jehovah"-that "Abraham was standing before Jehovah;" and when the Human was conjoined with the Divine, there was also together with them the Proceeding. </p>

'The men looked from there' means the Lord's thought from the Divine. This is clear from the meaning of 'looking from' as thinking, for 'seeing' in the internal sense, as in everyday speech, is understanding, 
since the understanding is internal sight, and thus 'looking from' means thinking, which is the activity of the internal sight or the understanding; and also from the meaning of 'the men' as 
the Divine. In various places in this chapter 'the men' are mentioned, and in various other places 'Jehovah' instead of 'the men'. When 'the men' is used the Trinity is meant, that is, the Divine itself, 
the Divine Human, and the [Holy] proceeding. The Lord's thought from this Divine is meant by the words 'the men looked from there'. That thought came from the Human joined to the Divine, which conjunction 
was dealt with at the start of this chapter; but the perception from which the thought stemmed came from the Divine, which explains why immediately afterwards in this same verse reference is 
made to Jehovah in the words 'he stood before Jehovah'. And when the Human had been joined to the Divine, the [Holy] proceeding was together with them as well. </p>

`Prospexerunt inde viri':  quod significet cogitationem Domini ex Divino, constat ex significatione `prospicere' quod sit cogitare; `videre' enim in sensu interno, sicut in communi sermonis, est intelligere, 
est enim intellectus visus internus; ita' `prospicere' est cogitare, quod est visus interni seu intellectus: tum ex significatione `virorum' quod sit Divinum: in hoc capite passim viri, passim 
pro viris Jehovah nominatur; cum viri, significatur Trinum, nempe {1} Divinum Ipsum, Divinum Humanum, et Procedens; cogitatio Domini ex hoc Divino significatur per quod `prospexerunt inde viri' (m)cogitatio 
fuit ex Humano conjuncto cum Divino, de qua conjunctione in principio hujus capitis actum, at perceptio ex qua cogitatio, fuit ex Divino, quare dicitur mox (o)in eodem hoc versu', Jehovah, quod 
`stans ille coram Jehovah'; cumque Humanum conjunctum Divino, etiam fuit una Procedens {2}.(n) 	@1 i de quo supra.$ 	@2 et cum ex humano conjuncto Divino etiam fuit una procedens.$ </p>
