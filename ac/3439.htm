<h3 align="center" class="ired">属天的奥秘 第3439节</h3>
<h4 align="center"></h4><p><strong>3439.</strong>“我是你父亲亚伯拉罕的神，不要惧怕！因为我与你同在”表神性也在那里，也就是说，在圣言的字义中。这从“亚伯拉罕”的代表清楚可知，“亚伯拉罕”是指主的神性（<a href="2833.htm">2833</a>，<a href="2836.htm">2836</a>，<a href="3251.htm">3251</a>，<a href="3305.htm">3305</a>节）。因此，“耶和华亚伯拉罕的神”表示亚伯拉罕所代表的主的神性。由于所论述的主题是圣言，也就是主，因为整部圣言来自祂，圣言的全部皆涉及祂，故“我是你父亲亚伯拉罕的神，不要惧怕！因为我与你同在”表示神性也在那里。至于圣言中的神性，情况是这样：神性本身存在于圣言的至高意义中，因为那就是主所在之处。神性也存在于内义中，因为那是主在天上的国度所在之处，因此这层意义被称为属天和属灵之义。神性还存在于圣言的字义中，因为那是主在地上的国度所在之处，因此这层意义被称为外在意义，以及属世之义。这层意义包含距离神性更为遥远的粗略表象，尽管那里的每一个事物仍是神性。这三层意义就像帐幕的各个部分那样彼此关联。帐幕的至内在部分，或幔子里面是装有石版的法柜所在之处，最为神圣，是至圣所；它的内在部分，或幔子之外紧接着就是金桌子和金灯台所在之处，也是神圣的；而外在部分，就是院子所在之处，也是圣地。这就是会众聚集的地方，故它被称为“会幕”。</p>

I am the God of Abraham thy father; fear not, for I am with thee. That this signifies that the Divine also was therein, namely, in the literal sense of the Word, is evident from the representation of 
Abraham, as being the Lord's Divine (n. 2833, 2836, 3251, 3305); hence Jehovah the "God of Abraham" signifies the Lord's Divine which is represented by Abraham; and because the subject treated of is 
the Word, which also is the Lord, because all the Word is from Him and everything of the Word is concerning Him, therefore by "I am the God of Abraham thy father; fear not, for I am with thee" is signified 
that the Divine also is therein. As regards the Divine in the Word, the case is this:  The Divine Itself is in the supreme sense of the Word, because therein is the Lord; the Divine is also in 
the internal sense, because therein is the Lord's kingdom in the heavens, and hence this sense is called celestial and spiritual; the Divine is also in the literal sense of the Word, because therein is 
the Lord's kingdom in the earths; hence this sense is called the external, and also the natural, sense, for in it are gross appearances more remote from the Divine; and yet the things therein are each 
and all Divine. With these three senses the case is as with the tabernacle: its inmost, or what was within the veil, where was the ark containing the testimony, was most holy, or the holy of holies; 
its internal, or what was immediately without the veil, where were the golden table and candlestick, was holy; and the external, where the court was, was also holy; in it the congregation assembled, 
and hence it was called the tent of the assembly. </p>

'I am the God of Abraham your father; do not fear, for I am with you' means that the Divine also was present there, that is to say, in the literal sense of the Word. This is clear from the representation 
of 'Abraham' as the Lord's Divine, dealt with in <a href="2833.htm">2833</a>, <a href="2836.htm">2836</a>, <a href="3251.htm">3251</a>, <a href="3305.htm">3305</a> (end). Consequently 'Jehovah the God of Abraham' means the Lord's Divine, which 'Abraham' represents. And as the subject is 
the Word, which also is the Lord since the whole Word comes from Him and the whole of the Word has reference to Him, 'I am the God of Abraham; do not fear, for I am with you' therefore means that the 
Divine also was present there. With regard to the Divine presence in the Word the position is that the Divine itself is present in the highest sense of the Word because that is where the Lord is. The 
Divine is also present in the internal sense because that is where the Lord's kingdom in heaven is, and therefore that sense is called the celestial and spiritual. The Divine is also present in the literal 
sense of the Word because that is where the Lord's kingdom on earth is, and therefore that sense is called the external and also the natural, for this sense contains crude appearances that are 
quite remote from the Divine, though every single thing there is nevertheless Divine. Those three senses are related to one another as parts of the tabernacle are related. Its inmost part, or that inside 
the veil where the ark containing the testimony stood, was the most holy place or the holy of holies; the internal part, or that directly outside the veil where the golden table and the lampstand 
stood, was the holy place; while the external part, where the court was situated, was also a holy place. This was where all the people met, and therefore it was called 'the Tent of Meeting'. </p>

`Ego Deus Abrahami patris tui, ne timeas, quia cum te Ego': quod significet quod Divinum etiam esset ibi, nempe in sensu litterali Verbi, constat ex repraesentatione `Abrahami' quod sit Divinum Domini, 
de qua n. 2833, 2836, 3251, 3305 f.; inde `Jehovah Deus Abrahami' significat Domini Divinum quod Abraham repraesentat; et quia agitur de Verbo, quod quoque est Dominus quia omne Verbum ab Ipso et 
omne Verbi de Ipso, ideo per `Ego Deus Abrahami ne timeas, quia cum te Ego' significatur quod Divinum etiam {1}sit ibi.  Cum Divino in {2}Verbo ita se habet: Ipsum Divinum est in sensu supremo Verbi, 
quia ibi est Dominus; Divinum etiam est in sensu interno, quia ibi est regnum Domini in caelis, inde {3}sensus ille vocatur caelestis et spiritualis; Divinum quoque est in sensu litterali Verbi {4}quia 
ibi est regnum Domini in terris, inde sensus ille vocatur externus ut et naturalis, sunt enim ibi apparentiae crassae, {5}a Divino remotiores: at usque ibi omnia et singula sunt Divina. Tres illi sensus 
se habent sicut se habuit tabernaculum; intimum ejus, seu quod intra velum, ubi arca in qua testimonium, fuit sanctissimum seu sanctum sanctorum; internum autem, seu quod immediate extra velum, ubi 
mensa aurea et candelabrum, erat sanctum; externum autem ubi atrium, etiam erat sanctum; ad illud conveniebat coetus et inde vocabatur `tentorium conventus.' @1 esset$  @2 sensu litterali Verbi$ 
 @3 hic sensus vocatur sensus Verbi$  @4 quia ibi etiam est Regnum Domini, sed externum quale est in terris in externa Ipsius Ecclesia$  @5 i quae$  </p>
