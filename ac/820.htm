<h3 align="center" class="ired">属天的奥秘 第820节</h3>
<h4 align="center"></h4><p><strong>820.</strong>在来生（灵界），那些曾从事抢劫和海盗行为的人喜欢臭气熏天的尿液胜过其它一切液体。在他们自己看来，他们似乎就住在这类事物和恶臭的粪池中。一个强盗咬牙切齿地靠近我。咬牙切齿的声音异常清晰，似乎就是从某个人那里发出来的，而令人惊讶的是，那里的人都没有牙齿。他坦承，相比清澈的碧水，他更喜欢住在污秽的尿液中，正是尿液的恶臭令他开心。他说，他宁愿呆在尿桶中，以之为家，而不愿呆在其它任何地方。</p>

<p><strong>[NCE]820.</strong> Those who engaged in robbery or piracy during physical life, love stinking, reeking urine above every other kind of fluid. They also seem to themselves to live among sewage of this kind and in bad-smelling ponds.<br />One outlaw approached me grinding his teeth. To my surprise I could hear the sound of the grinding as clearly as from a person on earth, even though these criminals do not have teeth. He admitted that he would much rather live in malodorous, urinous dampness than among the purest waters and that the stench of urine was what pleased him. He said that he preferred spending time in vats of urinous liquid to any other kind and that he wanted to make his home there. </p>
<p align="center"><b>Potts(1905-1910) 820</b></p><p><b>820.</b>
In the other life those who have practiced robbery and piracy love rank and fetid urine above all other liquids, and seem to themselves to dwell among such things, and among stagnant and stinking pools. 
A certain robber approached me, gnashing his teeth, the sound of which was as plainly heard as if it had proceeded from a man, which was strange, since they have no teeth. He confessed that he would 
rather live in urinous filth than by the clearest waters, and that the smell of urine was what he delighted in. He said he would rather stay and have his home in urinous vats than anywhere else. </p>

<p align="center"><b>Elliott(1983-1999) 820</b></p><p><b>820.</b>
People who during their lifetime have performed robberies, and those involved in acts of piracy, prefer stinking reeking urine to any other kind of fluid. To themselves they also seem to dwell among 
such things, and also among foul-smelling cesspools. A certain robber approached me, gnashing his teeth. The sound of teeth gnashing was clearly heard as of someone [on earth], which was surprising seeing 
that those who are there have no teeth. He confessed that he would far rather live among urinous filth than beside clear waters, and that it was the stink of urine that pleased him. He said he would 
rather stay in the urinous runs than anywhere else, and make his home there. </p>

</p><b>820.</b>
Qui latrocinia in vita corporis exercuerunt, et qui piratica, amant prae omnibus aliis liquidis urinam fetidam et graveolentam, in similibus quoque sibi habitare videntur, tum in stagnis fetide olentibus. 
 Quidam latro ad me accedens frendebat dentibus; sonus frendoris dentium ita manifeste auditus sicut hominis, quod mirum, tametsi iis non dentes; fassus quod multo potius cupiat in foedis urinosis 
vivere quam in aquis limpidissimis; et quod fetor urinae sit quo delectatur; in tonnis urinosis dicebat se morari velle prae aliis, et ibi domicilium habere. </p>
