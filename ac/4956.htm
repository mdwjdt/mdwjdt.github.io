<h4 align="center"></h4><p><strong>4956.</strong>对邻之仁的本质就是对良善与真理的情感，以及对自我是邪恶与虚假的承认。事实上，邻舍是良善与真理本身，对这些有一种情感就是拥有仁爱，而邻舍的反面是邪恶与虚假，凡拥有仁爱的人都远离它们。因此，凡拥有对邻之仁的人都被良善与真理感动，因为它们出于主，这种人远离邪恶与虚假，因为这些出于自我。当如此行时，他就出于自我承认而处于谦卑的状态；当处于谦卑状态时，他便处于接受来自主的良善与真理的状态。仁爱的这些基本要素就是主的这些话在内义上所传达的信息，即：我饿了，你们给我吃；渴了，你们给我喝；我作客旅，你们留我住；我赤身露体，你们给我穿；我病了，你们看顾我；我在监里，你们来看我。若不藉着内义，没有人知道这些话含有仁爱的基本要素在里面。拥有仁爱教义的古人知道这些事；但如今像这样的事似乎太过牵强，以至于若有人说这些话含有仁爱的基本要素在里面，人人都会感到惊讶。此外，与人同在的天使并不以其它任何方式来理解这些话，因为他们将“饥饿的人”理解为那些出于情感渴望良善的人，将“口渴的人”理解为那些出于情感渴慕真理的人；将“客旅（或寄居的）”理解为那些愿意被教导的人；将“赤身露体的人”理解为那些承认自己里面毫无良善与真理的人；将“患病的”理解为那些承认自己里面只有邪恶的人；将“被捆绑的”或那些“在监里”的人理解为那些承认自己里面只有虚假的人。这些事若化为一个意思，就表示刚才所描述仁爱的各个方面。</p>

The essence of charity toward the neighbor is the affection of good and truth, and the acknowledgment of self as being evil and false; yea, the neighbor is good and truth itself, and to be affected by 
these is to have charity. The opposite to the neighbor is evil and falsity, which are held in aversion by one who has charity. He therefore who has charity toward the neighbor is affected by good and 
truth, because they are from the Lord, and holds in aversion what is evil and what is false because these are from self; and when he does this, he is in humiliation from self-acknowledgment, and when 
he is in humiliation, he is in a state of reception of good and truth from the Lord. These are the characteristics of charity which in the internal sense are involved in these words of the Lord: "I 
was hungry, and ye gave Me to eat; I was thirsty, and ye gave Me drink; I was a stranger, and ye gathered Me; naked, and ye clothed Me; I was sick, and ye visited Me; I was in prison, and ye came unto 
Me." That these words involve such things, no one can know except from the internal sense. The ancients, who had the doctrinals of charity, knew these things; but at this day they appear so remote that 
everyone will wonder at its being said that these things are within. Moreover, the angels who are with man perceive these words no otherwise, for by the "hungry" they perceive those who from affection 
desire good; by the "thirsty," those who from affection desire truth; by a "stranger," those who are willing to be instructed; by the "naked," those who acknowledge that there is nothing of good and 
of truth in themselves; by the "sick," those who acknowledge that in themselves there is nothing but evil; and by the "bound," or those who are "in prison," those who acknowledge that in themselves 
there is nothing but falsity. If these things are reduced into one meaning, they signify what has been stated just above. </p>

Essentially charity towards the neighbour is an affection for goodness and truth and a recognition of oneself as being nothing but evil and falsity. Indeed the neighbour is one and the same as goodness 
and truth, and to have an affection for these is to have charity, while the opposite of the neighbour is evil and falsity, which a person who has charity turns away from. Anyone therefore who has charity 
towards the neighbour is moved by an affection for goodness and truth because they come from the Lord, and such a one turns away from evil and falsity because these come from himself. When he does 
this, humility is present in him as a consequence of his recognition of what he is in himself; and when such humility is present his state is one in which goodness and truth are received from the 
Lord. These essential ingredients of charity are the message in the internal sense of the following words used by the Lord, </p>
<p>I was hungry and you gave Me food, I was thirsty and you gave Me drink, I 
was a stranger and you took Me in, naked and you clothed Me around, I was sick and you visited Me, I was in prison and you came to Me.  </p>
<p>Except from the internal sense no one can know that these words 
hold the essential ingredients of charity within them. The ancients who possessed teachings regarding charity knew these things, but at the present day matters such as these seem so far-fetched that 
everyone will be astonished by the assertion that those words hold the essential ingredients of charity within them. What is more, the angels present with a person do not perceive those words in any 
other way, for by 'the hungry' they perceive those led by affection to desire good, by 'the thirsty' those led by affection to desire truth, by 'a stranger' those wishing to receive instruction, by 
'the naked' those acknowledging that no goodness or truth at all is present within them, by 'the sick' those acknowledging that within themselves there is nothing but evil, and by 'the bound' or 'those 
in prison those acknowledging that within themselves there is nothing but falsity. All these if taken as a whole mean the aspects of charity described immediately above. </p>

Charitatis erga proximum essentia est affectio boni et veri, et agnitio sui quod sit malum et falsum, immo proximus est ipsum bonum et verum; his affici est charitatem habere, oppositum proximo est 
malum et falsum, haec {1} aversatur qui charitatem habet; qui itaque charitatem erga proximum habet, afficitur bono et vero quia illa ex Domino, et aversatur malum et falsum quia illa ex e, et cum 
hoc facit, in humiliatione et ex a humiliatione in statu receptionis boni et veri est a Domino.  Haec charitatis sunt quae in sensu interno involvunt haec Domini Verba,           Esurivi et dedistis 
Mihi edere sitivi et potastis      Me, peregrinus fui et collegistis Me, nudus et      circuminduistis Me, aegrotus fui et visitastis Me, in      carcere fui et venistis ad Me. Quod haec verba 
illa involvant, nemo scire {2} potest quam ex sensu interno; antiqui qui doctrinalia charitatis habebant, illi haec sciebant; sed hodie haec tam remota apparent ut quisque miraturus quod dicatur 
quod illa insint; et praeterea angeli apud hominem non aliter illa verba percipiunt; per `esurientem' enim percipiunt illos qui ex affectione desiderant bonum, per `sitientem' illos qui ex affectione 
desiderant verum, per `peregrinum' illos qui instrui volunt, per `nudum' illos qui agnoscunt in se nihil nisi malum esse, et per `vinctos seu in illos qui agnoscunt in se nihil nisi malum esse, 
et per `vinctos seu in carcere' qui agnoscunt in se nihil nisi falsum: haec si in unum sensum rediguntur, significant illa quae mox supra dicta sunt. @1 illa$ @2 videre$ </p>
