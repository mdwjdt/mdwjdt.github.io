<h3 align="center" class="ired">属天的奥秘 第1755节</h3>
<h4 align="center"></h4><p><strong>1755.</strong>“所应得的分可以任凭他们拿去”表这些事物被置于他们的权力和控制之下。这从前面所述（14:21－23）清楚可知，大意是：主不愿接受源于它们的任何事物，因为主并不从这类事物中获取任何力量。 “它们被置于天使的权力和控制之下”，意思是这样：正是天使对邪恶的地狱灵进行实际统治，我已通过大量经历清楚得知这一点。然而，主预见并看到一切事，无论总体还是细节，并提供、安排这一切。不过，有些事是经祂允许发生的，有些事则是在祂的迁就下发生的，有些事是经祂同意的，有些事是出于祂的美意，而有些事则出于祂的旨意。控制他人的欲望完全是人自己的东西，与天使从主所接受的事物截然不同。天使的绝对控制是出于爱和怜悯，丝毫没有控制欲。这些事是极深的奥秘，无法用几句话理性阐明。只要知道邪恶的地狱灵被置于天使的权力和控制之下，主治理每一个事物，直至最后的细节就足够了。蒙主怜悯，这些问题等到后面论述天命（Providence）和许可（Permissions）时再予以讨论。</p>

<p><strong>[NCE]1755.</strong> These shall take their share means that they were given power over [the evil spirits], as can be seen from what was said above at verses <a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_1755/bible_king-james-version_genesis_14_21" target=_top>21</a>, <a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_1755/bible_king-james-version_genesis_14_22" target=_top>22</a>, <a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_1755/bible_king-james-version_genesis_14_23" target=_top>23</a>: that the Lord wanted nothing from [the evil spirits], since they had no strength to offer him.{*1} As regards the power over them given to the angels: A great deal of experience has made clear to me that angels are the ones who rule over evil and hellish spirits, but the Lord sees and foresees absolutely everything, and provides for and arranges absolutely everything. Sometimes he does so with bare tolerance, sometimes with reluctant permission, sometimes with acceptance, sometimes with pleasure, and sometimes with a will. The desire to control others is a strictly human trait, at odds with traits angels receive from the Lord, but when desire is absent, all control comes of love and mercy.<br />This idea is fairly arcane, though, so it cannot be explained intelligibly in a few words. It is enough to know that evil and hellish spirits are put under the angels' power and that the Lord governs absolutely everything, even the most minute details. I will say more about this below, with the Lord's divine mercy, where providence and permission are discussed [<a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_1755/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_2447" target=_top>2447</a>].<br /><br /><strong>Footnotes:</strong><br />{*1} On the powerlessness of the evil, see especially <a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_1755/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_1749" target=_top>1749</a>.

Let them take their portion. That this signifies that they had been given into their power, is evident from what was said above (at verses 21-33), namely, that it was the Lord's will to receive nothing 
from them, because He derived no strength from any such thing. That they had been given into the power of the angels stands thus: It is the angels who rule over evil and infernal spirits, as has been 
made evident to me from much experience. But the Lord foresees and sees all things in both general and particular, and provides and disposes for them; but some things from permission, some from sufferance, 
some from leave, some from good pleasure, some from will. The desire to rule is itself something of man's own which differs from anything that the angels receive from the Lord; but still all 
their dominion is of love and mercy, apart from any desire to rule. But these things, being deeper arcana, cannot be stated to the understanding in a few words. It is sufficient to know that the evil 
and infernal spirits have been delivered into the power [potestas] of the angels, and that the Lord governs all things, both in general and in particular, down to the veriest singulars, concerning which, 
of the Lord's Divine mercy hereafter, where Providence and Permissions are treated of.  </p>

That 'these will take their share' means that these things were placed under their power and control is clear from what has been stated above at verses 21-23, to the effect that the Lord was unwilling 
to have anything that derived from them, since the Lord derived no strength whatever from that source. By 'they were placed under the power and control of the angels' the following is meant, that it 
is the angels who actually rule over evil and hellish spirits, as has been clear to me from much experience. The Lord however foresees and sees all things and every individual thing; and He provides 
and arranges the same, though some things arise from His permission, some from His concession, some from His consent, some from His good pleasure, and some from His will. The desire to control others 
is something altogether man's own, quite different from anything angels receive from the Lord. Angels' entire exercise of control is grounded in love and mercy, devoid of any desire to dominate. But as 
these are rather deep arcana they cannot be presented intelligibly in a few words. It is enough if one knows that evil and hellish spirits were placed under the power and control of the angels, and 
that the Lord governs all things, and every single thing, down to the last detail. These matters will in the Lord's Divine mercy be discussed later on where Providence and Permissions are dealt with. </p>

</p><b>1755.</b>
Quod 'hi accipient portionem suam' significet quod dati sint in illorum potestatem, constat ex illis quae supra ad vers. 21-23 dicta sunt, quod nempe Dominus nihil ab illis habere vellet, quia nihil 
roboris Domino inde: quod dati sint in potestatem angelorum ita se habet: angeli sunt qui dominantur super spiritus malos et infernales, ut a multa experientia mihi constitit; Dominus autem praevidet 
ac videt omnia et singula, et providet ac disponit omnia et singula, sed quaedam ex permissione, quaedam ex admissione, quaedam ex venia, quaedam ex beneplacito, quaedam ex voluntate; ipsum dominari 
velle est aliquod proprium humanum diversum ab illis quae accipiunt a Domino; sed usque omne dominium est amoris et misericordiae absque velle dominari: verum haec quia arcaniora sunt, non ad intellectum 
dici possunt paucis; satis est scire quod spiritus mali et infernales dati sint in potestatem (x)angelorum, et quod Dominus omnia et singula, etiam singularissima gubernet; de quibus, ex Divina Domini 
Misericordia, in sequentibus ubi de Providentia et Permissionibus. </p>
