<h4 align="center"></h4><p><strong>348.</strong>“地里的出产”表无仁之信的行为，这一点也可从下文清楚看出来；缺乏仁的信之行为，其实是无信的行为，本身是死的，因为它们仅出于外在人。对此，耶利米书上记着：<br />“恶人道路有何亨通呢？你栽培了他们，他们也扎了根，长大，而且结果。他们的口是与你相近，心却与你远离。这地悲哀，田野的青草都枯干，要等到几时呢？”（耶利米书<a href="http://39-27.cn/耶12.1.htm">12:1</a>-<a href="http://39-27.cn/耶12.2.htm">2</a>，<a href="http://39-27.cn/耶12.4.htm">4</a>）<br />“口相近，心远离”表信与仁分离之人，对于这种人，经上说“地悲哀”。在该先知书，这种行为还被称为“作事的结果”：<br />“人心比万物都诡诈，坏到极处，谁能识透呢？我耶和华是鉴察人心、试验人肺腑的，要照各人所行的和他作事的结果报应各人。”（耶利米书<a href="http://39-27.cn/耶17.9.htm">17:9</a>-<a href="http://39-27.cn/耶17.10.htm">10</a>）<br />“这地因居民的缘故，又因他们行事的结果，必然荒凉。”（弥迦书<a href="http://39-27.cn/弥7.13.htm">7:13</a>）<br />这种果子根本不是果子，或说这种行为是死的。这果与根都灭亡了，因此，阿摩司书声称：<br />“我从以色列人面前除灭亚摩利人，他虽高大如香柏树，坚固如橡树，我却上灭他的果子，下绝他的根本。”（阿摩司书<a href="http://39-27.cn/摩2.9.htm">2:9</a>）<br />“你必从地上除灭他们的果子，从人的众子中除灭他们的后裔。”（诗篇<a href="http://39-27.cn/诗21.10.htm">21:10</a>）<br />但源于仁的行为是活的，被称作“往下扎根”和“向上结果”。如：<br />“犹大家所逃脱余剩的，仍要往下扎根，向上结果。”（以赛亚书<a href="http://39-27.cn/赛37.31.htm">37:31</a>）<br />“向上结果”是指出于仁而行。在该先知书，这样的果子还被称为“夸耀的果实”：<br />“到那日，耶和华发生的苗必华美荣耀，那地的果实成为以色列那些逃脱的人的夸耀和光荣。”（以赛亚书<a href="http://39-27.cn/赛4.2.htm">4:2</a>）<br />它还是“拯救的果子”，如以赛亚书所称谓的：<br />“诸天哪，自上而滴，穹苍降下公义；地面开裂，产出拯救的果子，使公义一同生长。我耶和华要创造它”（以赛亚书<a href="http://39-27.cn/赛45.8.htm">45:8</a>）。</p>

<p><strong>[NCE]348.</strong> The fact that the fruit of the ground means doing what faith requires without loving others is also evident from what follows. Deeds of faith that lack charity are deeds devoid of faith. In themselves they are dead, since they belong exclusively to the outer self. Jeremiah speaks of them this way:<br />Why is the path of the godless successful? You planted them; they also took root. They grew; they also produce fruit. You are nearby in their mouth but far from their kidneys.{*1} How long will the land mourn and the grass of every field wither? (<a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_348/bible_king-james-version_jeremiah_12_1-2" target=_top>Jeremiah 12:1-2</a>, <a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_348/bible_king-james-version_jeremiah_12_4" target=_top>4</a>)<br />"Nearby in their mouth but far from their kidneys" refers to those who advocate a faith detached from charity. It says of them that the land mourns. The same book calls [acts of faith devoid of charity] "the fruit of their deeds":<br />The heart is more a usurper than anything else is and is beyond hope. Who really knows the heart? I, Jehovah, am examining the heart, testing the kidneys, and [my purpose is] to give them each as their ways deserve, as the fruit of their deeds deserves. (<a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_348/bible_king-james-version_jeremiah_17_9-10" target=_top>Jeremiah 17:9-10</a>)<br />In Micah:<br />The land will become a desolate place because of its residents, in return for the fruit of their deeds. (<a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_348/bible_king-james-version_micah_7_13" target=_top>Micah 7:13</a>)<br />But Amos says this kind of fruit is nonfruit — that is, it is the work of dead people — and both the fruit and the root are destroyed:<br />Before their faces I have destroyed the Amorites, whose height was like the height of cedars. And they were strong, like an oak, yet I destroyed their fruit upward and their roots downward. (<a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_348/bible_king-james-version_amos_2_9" target=_top>Amos 2:9</a>)<br />And in David:<br />Their fruit you will destroy from the earth and their seed from among the children of humankind. (<a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_348/bible_king-james-version_psalms_21_10" target=_top>Psalms 21:10</a>)<br />But deeds inspired by charity are alive. They are said to send roots below and yield fruit above, as in Isaiah:<br />The remaining refugees of Judah's house will put new root downward and produce fruit upward. (<a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_348/bible_king-james-version_isaiah_37_31" target=_top>Isaiah 37:31</a>)<br />To produce fruit upward is to act with charity as motivation. The fruit is called excellent in the same author:<br />On that day Jehovah's offshoot will become the beauty and glory — and the earth's fruit will become the excellence and adornment — of Israel's rescuees. (<a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_348/bible_king-james-version_isaiah_4_2" target=_top>Isaiah 4:2</a>)<br />It is also the fruit of salvation, as the same author terms it:<br />Drizzle, you heavens, from above, and let the heights of the sky flow with justice. Let the earth open, and let them bear the fruit of salvation, and let justice sprout together with it. I, Jehovah, will create this. (<a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_348/bible_king-james-version_isaiah_45_8" target=_top>Isaiah 45:8</a>)<br /><br /><strong>Footnotes:</strong><br />{*1} The ancient Hebrews regarded the kidneys as a seat of the emotions, much as the heart still is regarded in our culture. See, for example, <a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_348/bible_king-james-version_job_19_27" target=_top>Job 19:27</a>; <a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_348/bible_king-james-version_psalms_16_7" target=_top>Psalms 16:7</a>; <a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_348/bible_king-james-version_psalms_73_21" target=_top>73:21</a>; <a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_348/bible_king-james-version_proverbs_23_16" target=_top>Proverbs 23:16</a>.

That by the "fruit of the ground" are meant the works of faith without charity, appears also from what follows; for the works of faith devoid of charity are works of no faith, being in themselves dead, 
for they are solely of the external man. Of such it is written in Jeremiah: </p>
<p>     Wherefore doth the way of the wicked prosper? Thou hast planted them, they also have taken root; they have gone on, 
they also bear fruit; Thou art near in their mouth, and far from their reins; how long shall the land mourn, and the herb of every field wither? (Jer. 12:1, 2, 4). "Near in the mouth, but far from the 
reins" denotes those who are of faith separated from charity, concerning whom it is said that "the land mourns." In the same Prophet such works are called the "fruit of works:"      The heart is deceitful 
[supplantativum] above all things, and it is desperate, who can know it? I Jehovah search the heart, I try the reins, even to give to every man according to his ways, and according to the fruit 
of his works (Jer. 17:9, 10). In Micah: </p>
<p>     The land shall be desolate because of them that dwell therein, for the fruit of their works (Mic. 7:13). That such "fruit" is no fruit, or that the "work" 
is dead, and that both fruit and root perish, is thus declared in Amos: </p>
<p>     I destroyed the Amorite before them, whose height was like the height of the cedars, and he was strong as the oaks; 
yet I destroyed his fruit from above, and his roots from beneath (Amos 2:9). And in David: </p>
<p>     Their fruit shalt Thou destroy from the earth, and their seed from the sons of man (Ps. 21:10). But the 
works of charity are living, and of them it is declared that they "take root downward, and bear fruit upward;" as in Isaiah: </p>
<p>     The remnant that is escaped of the house of Judah shall again take 
root downward, and bear fruit upward (Isa. 37:31). To "bear fruit upward" is to act from charity. Such fruit is called the "fruit of excellence" in the same Prophet: </p>
<p>     In that day shall the shoot 
of Jehovah be beautiful and glorious, and the fruit of the earth excellent and comely for them that are escaped of Israel (Isa. 4:2). It is also the "fruit of salvation" and is so called by the same 
Prophet: </p>
<p>     Drop down, ye heavens, from above, and let the skies pour down righteousness; let the earth open, and let them bring forth the fruit of salvation, and let righteousness spring up together; 
I Jehovah will create it (Isa. 45:8). </p>

'The fruit of the ground' is used to mean the works of faith devoid of charity. This also is evident from what follows. In effect the works of faith devoid of charity are the works of no faith at all. 
In themselves they are dead since they belong purely to the external man. Such works are referred to in Jeremiah as follows,  </p>
<blockquote>
Why does the way of the wicked prosper? You have planted them, they have 
also taken root, they have gone on, they are also producing fruit. You are near in their mouth but far from their heart.<A name="fntext1"></a><A href="#fn1"><sup>a</sup></a> How long will the land mourn and the grass of every field wither? <a href="http://bible.gospelcom.net/cgi-bin/bible?passage=Jer%2012:1,%202,%204&amp;version=ESV&amp;interface=print&amp;showfn=yes&amp;showxref">Jer 12:1, 2, 4</a>.   
</blockquote>
'Near in their mouth but far from their heart'<A name="fntext1"></a><A href="#fn1"><sup>a</sup></a> means adherents to faith separated from charity, of whom it is said that 'the land mourns'. They are also called in the same prophet 'the fruit 
of works',  </p>
<blockquote>
The heart is deceitful above all, and is something hopeless. Who knows it? I Jehovah who searches the heart and tries the reins, to give to everyone according to his ways, according 
to the fruit of his works. <a href="http://bible.gospelcom.net/cgi-bin/bible?passage=Jer%2017:9,%2010&amp;version=ESV&amp;interface=print&amp;showfn=yes&amp;showxref">Jer 17:9, 10</a>.  
</blockquote>
<p>In Micah,  </p>
<blockquote>
The earth will be a desolation because of its inhabitants, for the fruit of their works. <a href="http://bible.gospelcom.net/cgi-bin/bible?passage=Micah%207:13&amp;version=ESV&amp;interface=print&amp;showfn=yes&amp;showxref">Micah 7:13</a>.  
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
But the fact that this kind of fruit 
is no fruit at all, that is, a work that is dead, and that both this fruit and root perish, is stated in Amos,    I destroyed the Amorite before them, whose height was like the height of the cedars, 
and whose strength was like the oaks. Yet I destroyed his fruit above and his roots beneath. <a href="http://bible.gospelcom.net/cgi-bin/bible?passage=Amos%202:9&amp;version=ESV&amp;interface=print&amp;showfn=yes&amp;showxref">Amos 2:9</a>.  
</blockquote>
<p>And in David,  </p>
<blockquote>
You will destroy their fruit from the earth and their seed from the sons 
of man. <a href="http://bible.gospelcom.net/cgi-bin/bible?passage=Ps%2021:10&amp;version=ESV&amp;interface=print&amp;showfn=yes&amp;showxref">Ps 21:10</a>.  
</blockquote>
<p>But works that stem from charity are alive, and are referred to as 'taking root below' and 'yielding fruit above', as in Isaiah,  </p>
<blockquote>
And the surviving remnant of the house of 
Judah will take root downwards and bear fruit upwards <a href="http://bible.gospelcom.net/cgi-bin/bible?passage=Isa%2037:31&amp;version=ESV&amp;interface=print&amp;showfn=yes&amp;showxref">Isa 37:31</a>. 
</blockquote>
<p>'Producing fruit upwards' is doing so from charity. In the same prophet such fruit is called 'a fruit that is excellent',  </p>
<blockquote>
On that 
day the branch of Jehovah will be beauty and glory, and the fruit of the land will be excellence and an adornment for the survivors of Israel. <a href="http://bible.gospelcom.net/cgi-bin/bible?passage=Isa%204:2&amp;version=ESV&amp;interface=print&amp;showfn=yes&amp;showxref">Isa 4:2</a>.  
</blockquote>
<p>It is also 'the fruit of salvation', as 
it is called in the same prophet,  </p>
<blockquote>
Shower, O heavens, from above, and let the skies rain with righteousness; let the earth open, and let them bear the fruit of salvation, and let righteousness spring 
up together. I Jehovah will create it. <a href="http://bible.gospelcom.net/cgi-bin/bible?passage=Isa%2045:8&amp;version=ESV&amp;interface=print&amp;showfn=yes&amp;showxref">Isa 45:8</a>.

Quod per 'fructum humi' intelligantur opera fidei absque charitate, ex sequentibus etiam patet; opera enim fidei absque charitate sunt opera nullius fidei, in se mortua, nam sunt solum externi hominis; 
de quibus ita apud Jeremiam, Quare via impiorum prosperatur?...Plantasti eos, etiam radicati sunt, iverunt, etiam faciunt fructum, propinquus Tu in ore eorum, sed longinquus a renibus eorum,...quousque 
lugebit terra, et herba omnis agri exarescet? xii 1, 2, 4; </p>
<p>'propinquus in ore, sed longinquus a renibus' sunt qui ex fide separata a charitate, de quibus praedicatur quod 'terra lugeat.' Vocantur 
etiam 'fructus operum' apud eundem, Supplantativum cor prae omni, et desperatum id; quis cognoscit id? Ego Jehovah scrutans cor, probans renes, et ac dandum unicuivis juxta vias ejus, juxta fructum 
operum ejus xvii 9, 10: </p>
<p>apud Micham, Erit terra in desolationem propter habitatores suos, pro fructu operum eorum, vii 13. Sed quod talis fructus nullus fructus sit, seu quod opus mortuum sit, et 
quod pereat et fructus et radix, apud Amos, Perdidi Emoraeum coram illis, cujus sicut altitudo cedrorum altitudo ejus, et robustus is sicut quercus, perdidi tamen fructum ejus sursum, et radices ejus 
deorsum, ii 9: </p>
<p>et apud Davidem, 	Fructum eorum de terta perdes, et semen eorum de filiis hominis, Ps. xxi II [A.V. 10]. At opera charitatis viva sunt, de quibus praedicatur quod 'radices agant infra' 
et 'fructum edant supra,' ut apud Esaiam, 	Addet evasio domus Jehudae residua radicem deorsum, et faciet fructum sursum, xxxvii 31; </p>
