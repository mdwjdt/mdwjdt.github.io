Verses 16-20. And the voice was heard in Pharaoh's house, saying, Joseph's brethren have come; and it was good in the eyes of Pharaoh, and in the eyes of his servants. And Pharaoh said unto Joseph, Say 
unto thy brethren, This do ye; lade your beasts, and go, come ye into the land of Canaan; and take your father and your households, and come unto me; and I will give you the good of the land of Egypt, 
and ye shall eat the fat of the land. And now commanded, this do ye: take you out of the land of Egypt carts for your babes, and for your women, and bring your father, and come. And let not your eye 
be sparing upon your stuff; because the good of the whole land of Egypt, this is for you. "And the voice was heard in Pharaoh's house," signifies that this filled the universal natural; "saying, Joseph's 
brethren have come," signifies perception that the truths of the church are present in the natural; "and it was good in the eyes of Pharaoh," signifies joy therein throughout; "and in the eyes 
of his servants," signifies even to the lowest things there; "and Pharaoh said unto Joseph," signifies the perception of the natural from the internal celestial; "Say unto thy brethren," signifies about 
the truths of the church in the natural; "This do ye; lade your beasts," signifies that they should fill up every truth with good; "and go, come ye into the land of Canaan," signifies their dwelling-place; 
"and take your father and your households, and come unto me," signifies the approach of spiritual good and of the truths of the church to the memory-knowledges of the natural; "and I will give 
you the good of the land of Egypt," signifies the possession of memory-knowledges; "and ye shall eat the fat of the land," signifies the appropriation of good there; "and now commanded, this do ye," 
signifies the will; "take you out of the land of Egypt carts," signifies the doctrinal things of memory-knowledges; "for your babes, and for your women," signifies for those who do not yet know; "and 
bring your father, and come," signifies their service and approach; "and let not your eye be sparing upon your stuff," signifies that things instrumental are not to be cared for; "because the good of 
the whole land of Egypt, this is for you," signifies that they have what is primary in the natural mind. </p>

Verses 16-20 And a voice was heard in Pharaoh's house, saying, Joseph's brothers have come. And it was good in Pharaoh's eyes, and in the eyes of his servants. And Pharaoh said to Joseph, Say to your 
brothers, Do this: Load your animals, and go, get you to the land of Canaan. And take your father and your households, and come to me; and I will give you the good of the land of Egypt, and you will 
eat the fat of the land. And now carry out this command: Take for yourselves from the land of Egypt carts for your young children and your wives, and bring your father, and come. And do not let your eye 
be sparing over your household utensils, for the good of all the land of Egypt is yours.  </p>
<p>'And a voice was heard in Pharaoh's house' means that it filled the entire natural. 'Saying, Joseph's brothers 
have come' means a perception that the truths of the Church within the natural were present. 'And it was good in Pharaoh's eyes' means joy everywhere there. 'And in the eyes of his servants' means 
including what occupied the lowest position there. 'And Pharaoh said to Joseph' means a perception received by the natural from the internal celestial. 'Say to your brothers' means regarding the truths 
of the Church within the natural. 'Do this: Load your animals' means that they were to fill every truth with good. 'And go, get you to the land of Canaan' means their dwelling-place. 'And take your 
father and your households, and come to me' means the drawing of spiritual good and of the truths of the Church nearer to factual knowledge in the natural. 'And I will give you the good of the land 
of Egypt' means the possession of factual knowledge. 'And you will eat the fat of the land' means making the good there their own. 'And now carry out this command' means an act of will. 'Take for yourselves 
from the land of Egypt carts' means matters of doctrine belonging to factual knowledge. 'For your young children and your wives' means for those who as yet have no knowledge. 'And bring your 
father, and come' means their service and their drawing nearer. 'And do not let your eye be sparing over your household utensils' means let no concern be shown for anything that serves instrumentally. 
'For the good of all the land of Egypt is yours' means that which in the natural mind is of primary importance to them.  </p>
