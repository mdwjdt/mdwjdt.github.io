<h3 align="center" class="ired">属天的奥秘 第2910节</h3>
<h4 align="center"></h4><p><strong>2910.</strong>“亚伯拉罕为撒拉哀恸哭号”表主的悲痛状态，也就是说，主因教会的信之真理处于黑夜而悲痛。这从亚伯拉罕的代表清楚可知，亚伯拉罕是指主（参看<a href="1893.htm">1893</a>，<a href="1965.htm">1965</a>，<a href="1989.htm">1989</a>，<a href="2011.htm">2011</a>，<a href="2172.htm">2172</a>，<a href="2501.htm">2501</a>，<a href="2833.htm">2833</a>，<a href="2836.htm">2836</a>节）。“哀恸哭号”表悲痛的状态，这是显而易见的，无需解释。“哀恸”涉及因教会的良善处于黑夜而引发的悲痛，“哭号”则涉及因真理而引发的悲痛。这两节论述了教会的终结，仁爱不复存在之时，就是教会的终结之时。教会的终结在圣言多处有所论述，尤其在先知书和约翰的启示录。主也在福音书中大量描述了这种终结，并称其为“世代的末了”，以及“黑夜”。<br />对所有教会来说，情况是这样：一开始，每个教会都视仁爱为根本。那时，人人都视他人为自己的兄弟，并因良善而感动，不是为他自己的缘故，而是为邻人、团体、主的国度，尤其主自己的缘故。但随着时间推移，仁爱开始变得冷淡，不复存在。后来，彼此的仇恨开始进入，尽管这仇恨并未显于表面，因为在文明社会，人们服从法律，服从克制他们的外在约束，但仇恨仍从内心滋生出来。克制他们的外在约束源于我欲和物欲，就是对荣耀、显赫的热爱，对财富和带来财富的权力的热爱，因而对名声的热爱。对邻人的仇恨就隐藏在这些爱欲下面，这仇恨具有这样的性质：人们渴望控制所有人，占有他人的一切事物。当这些欲望遭到反对时，这种人就心怀对那邻人的蔑视，时行报复，以毁灭他为乐，事实上，只要敢，就会实施残忍行为。当教会终结时，其仁爱最终会堕入此类事中。那时，论到教会，可以说信已不复存在。因为哪里没有仁爱，哪里就没有信仰，这在前面说过多次。<br />我们从圣言得知，以这种方式走向终结的教会有很多。大洪水之时的上古教会就是这样灭绝的，大洪水后的古教会、名为希伯来教会的第二代古教会，以及最后的犹太教会同样是这样灭绝的。不过，犹太教会绝不是一开始拥有仁爱的教会，只不过是教会的代表。它的作用就是通过代表物与天堂保持联系，直到主降世。此后一个新教会由主建立，该教会被称为外邦人的教会，是一个内在教会。因为那时，内在真理已被主揭示出来。然而，如今，甚至连这个教会也走到尽头，仁爱不仅不复存在，而且还被仇恨取代。只是这仇恨表面并未显现出来，但它却在于内，并且只要有可能，就会爆发出来，也就是说，每当外在约束阻止不了时，就会爆发。<br />除了这些教会外，还有很多其它教会也是这样衰退并自我毁灭的，只是在圣言中没有具体的描述。它们如此衰退并自我毁灭的原因有很多。一个原因是，父母累积邪恶，并因频繁实施这些邪恶，最终变得习惯。他们将这些恶植入在自己的本性和性情中，从而通过遗传将其传给自己的后代。因为父母在实际生活中通过频繁实践所获得的一切，都会植根于他们的属世性情中，并通过遗传传给子孙后代。除非这些子孙后代得以改造和重生，否则，所传之物会代代相传，并一直增长。结果，意愿变得更倾向于邪恶与虚假。不过，当教会走向尽头或灭亡时，主总会在某个其它地方兴起一个新教会。然而，即便有，主也很少从前教会成员中兴起新教会，而是从无知的外邦人中兴起。下文将论述这些外邦人。</p>

And Abraham came to mourn for Sarah and to weep for her. That this signifies the Lord's state of grief on account of the night as to truths of faith in the church, is evident from the representation 
of Abraham, as being the Lord (see n. 1893, 1965, 1989, 2011, 2172, 2501, 2833, 2836). That to "mourn" and to "weep" signify a state of grief is evident without explication; to "mourn" has respect to 
grief on account of night as to good in the church, and to "weep" as to truths. These two verses treat of the end of the church; its end is when there is no longer any charity. This state is treated of 
in many places in the Word, especially in the Prophets, and in John in Revelation; the Lord also describes this end by many things in the Evangelists, and calls it the "consummation of the age," and 
also "night." [2] For with churches the case is this: In the beginning charity is fundamental with them; everyone then loves another as a brother, and is affected from good, not for his own sake, but 
for the sake of the neighbor, the community, the kingdom of the Lord, and above all things for the Lord's sake. But in process of time charity begins to grow cold and to become naught. Afterwards comes 
hatred of one another; which, although it does not appear outwardly, because in civic society men are under laws, and are under outward bonds of restraint, still is nourished inwardly. These outward 
bonds of restraint come from the love of self and of the world; they are the love of honor and eminence, the love of gain and hence also of power, thus the love of reputation. Under these loves hatred 
against the neighbor conceals itself, which is of such a nature that men desire to have command over all, and to possess all things that are another's; and when these desires are opposed, they treasure 
in their hearts contempt for the neighbor, they breathe revenge, they take delight in his ruin, and even practice cruelties so far as they dare. Into things like these does the charity of the church 
at its end at last decline, and then it is said of it that there is no longer any faith, for where there is no charity there is no faith, as has been shown many times. [3] There have been a number 
of churches, known to us from the Word, that had such an end. The Most Ancient Church thus expired about the time of the flood; in like manner the Ancient Church which was after the flood; also a second 
Ancient Church, called the Hebrew Church; and at last the Jewish Church, which was by no means a church that commenced from charity, but was only the representative of a church, to the intent that 
by representatives communication with heaven might survive, until the Lord came into the world. Afterwards a new church was raised up by the Lord, called the Church of the Gentiles, which was internal, 
for interior truths had been revealed by the Lord; but this church is now at its end, because now there is not only no charity, but there is hatred instead of charity; which hatred, though it does 
not appear outwardly, yet is within, and breaks out whenever possible with anyone, that is, whenever outward bonds do not restrain. [4] Besides these churches there have been very many others that 
are not so fully described, which in like manner decreased and destroyed themselves. There are many causes for such decrease and self-destruction; one is that parents accumulate evils, and by frequent 
practice, and at length by habit, they implant them in their nature, and so by inheritance transcribe them upon their offspring; for what parents acquire from actual life by frequent use is rooted in 
their nature and is transmitted by inheritance to posterity; and unless the posterity is reformed or regenerated, it is continued to successive generations and is all the time increasing; and thus the 
will becomes more prone to evils and falsities. But when a church is consummated and perishes, then the Lord always raises up a new church somewhere; but rarely, if ever, from the people of the former 
church; but from nations that have been in ignorance. Concerning these in what follows. </p>

'And Abraham came to mourn for Sarah and to weep for her' means a state in which the Lord grieved, that is to say, because it was night as regards the truths of faith within the Church. This is clear 
from the representation of 'Abraham' as the Lord, dealt with in <a href="1893.htm">1893</a>, <a href="1965.htm">1965</a>, <a href="1989.htm">1989</a>, <a href="2011.htm">2011</a>, <a href="2172.htm">2172</a>, <a href="2501.htm">2501</a>, <a href="2833.htm">2833</a>, <a href="2836.htm">2836</a>. That 'mourning' and 'weeping' mean a state involving grief is clear without explanation. 
'Mourning' has regard to grief on account of its being night as regards goods within the Church, and 'weeping' as regards truths. These two verses have dealt with the end of the Church, which arrives 
when charity does not exist any longer. The end of the Church is the subject many times in the Word, especially in the Prophets and in John, in the Book of Revelation. The Lord too in the Gospels describes 
that end extensively, calling it the close of the age, and also night. </p>
<p></p>
<p><b>[2]</b>
 The situation with all Churches is that initially every Church regards charity as being fundamental. At that time 
every individual person loves every other as his brother and is moved by good - not on his own account but on account of that person, of the general good of all, of the Lord's kingdom, and above all of 
the Lord Himself. But with the passage of time charity starts to grow cold and to cease to exist. After that, hatred of one person against another enters in, which - though not apparent outwardly because 
people in organized society are subject to laws and to external restraints which keep them in check - is nevertheless being fostered inwardly. The external restraints keeping them in check stem 
from self-love and love of the world, being the love of position and importance, the love of wealth and also of the power that wealth brings, and so the love of reputation. Beneath these loves there lurks 
hatred of the neighbour, such as leads people to desire dominion over all and to possess everything that belongs to anyone else. And when these desires are opposed, such persons harbour in their 
mind contempt for that neighbour, breathe revenge, and take delight in his ruin, and indeed perform acts of cruelty on him insofar as they dare. It is into ways such as these that the charity of the Church 
ultimately goes when it reaches its end. At that time it is said of the Church that faith does not exist any longer, for when there is no charity there is no faith, as has been shown many times. </p>
<p></p>
<p><b>[3]</b>
There have been many Churches, which are known of from the Word, that have come to an end in this fashion. The Most Ancient Church breathed its last in such circumstances around the time of the 
Flood. So in a similar way did the Ancient Church which existed after the Flood, as also did the second Ancient Church called the Hebrew Church; and later on the Jewish Church. This never was a Church 
that had charity at the outset, but was merely the representative of a Church whose role was to preserve by means of representatives a communication with heaven until the Lord came into the world. 
After that a new Church was established by the Lord, which was called the gentile Church and was an internal Church since interior truths from the Lord had then been revealed. But even this Church has 
now reached its end, for now not only is charity non-existent but also hatred is present instead of charity. Although that hatred is not apparent outwardly it is nevertheless there inwardly and breaks 
out when at all possible, that is, as often as external restraints do not keep people in check. </p>
<p></p>
<p><b>[4]</b>
 In addition to these Churches there have been many others which have not been described so specifically 
[in the Word] but which deteriorated in a similar way and destroyed themselves. There are many reasons why they have so deteriorated and destroyed themselves. One reason is that parents pile 
up evils, and from practicing these frequently until at length they become habitual, introduce them into their own nature and disposition, and in so doing hand them down by heredity to their offspring. 
For what parents acquire through frequent practice in their actual living takes root within their natural disposition and is transmitted by heredity to their descendants. And unless these are reformed 
or regenerated, that which is transmitted is perpetuated in succeeding generations, increasing all the time as it is passed down. Consequently the will becomes even more bent on evils and falsities. 
But when the Church reaches its close and perishes the Lord always raises up a new Church somewhere else. Yet rarely, if ever, has He done so from members of the previous Church, but from gentiles who 
dwelt in ignorance. Those gentiles are the subject in what follows next. </p>

`Et venit Abraham ad lugendum Saram, et ad deflendum illam':  quod significet statum doloris Domini, nempe ob noctem quoad vera fidei in Ecclesia, constat a repraesentatione `Abrahami' quod sit Dominus, 
de qua n. 1893, 1965, 1989, 2011, 2172, 2501, 2833, 2836; quod `lugere et deflere' significent statum doloris, constat absque explicatione; `lugere' spectat dolorem propter noctem quoad bona in Ecclesia, 
et `deflere' quoad vera.  In duobus his versibus actum est de fine Ecclesiae; {1}ejus finis est cum nulla amplius charitas; de {2}illo in Verbo pluries agitur, imprimis apud Prophetas et apud 
Johannem in Apocalypsi; Dominus etiam finem illum multis describit apud Evangelistas, et illum vocat consummationem saeculi, ut et noctem:   ita enim se habet cum Ecclesiis:  [2] in principio charitas 
illis fundamentalis est; quisque tunc alterum amat ut fratrem, et afficitur ex bono non propter se, sed propter proximum, propter commune, propter regnum Domini, et supra omnia propter Dominum, sed 
temporis tractu charitas incipit frigescere et nulla fieri; postea venit odium unius contra alterum, quod tametsi non apparet in externa forma, quia in societate civili sub legibus sunt, et in vinculis 
externis quae cohibent, usque intus fovetur; vincula externa quae cohibent, veniunt ex amore sui et mundi, et sunt amor honoris et eminentiae, amor lucri et inde quoque potentiae, ita amor famae; sub 
his amoribus odium contra proximum se occultat, quod tale est ut omnibus imperare velint, et omnia quae alius sunt, possidere, quae cum oppugnantur, animo recondunt contra proximum illum contemptum, 
spirant vindictam, sentiunt jucundum in ejus pernicie, immo crudelitates exercent quantum audent; in talia demum abit charitas Ecclesiae cum ejus finis est, et tunc dicitur de illa quod nulla amplius 
fides, nam ubi non  charitas nec est fides, quod multoties ostensum:  [3] fuerunt plures Ecclesiae quae ex Verbo notae sunt, quibus talis finis fuit; Antiquissima Ecclesia ita exspiravit circa diluvium; 
Antiqua Ecclesia quae post diluvium, similiter; etiam Ecclesia altera Antiqua quae Hebraea vocata; demum Ecclesia Judaica, quae nusquam fuit aliqua Ecclesia a charitate incohans, sed modo fuit repraesentativa 
Ecclesiae, ob causam ut per repraesentativa superesset communicatio cum caelo antequam Dominus veniret in mundum; dein a Domino exsuscitata est nova Ecclesia, quae gentium dicta, et fuit 
interna, nam interiora vera a Domino revelata sunt, sed haec Ecclesia nunc in suo fine est, quia {3}nunc non solum nulla charitas est, sed loco charitatis odium, quod tametsi non externa forma apparet, 
usque interius est, ac erumpit quoties alicui possibile est, hoc est, quoties externa vincula non cohibent.  [4] Praeter illas Ecclesias fuerunt perplures quae non ita descriptae sunt, quae similiter 
decreverunt et se destruxerunt.  Causae quod ita decrescant et se destruant, sunt plures; una est quod parentes cumulent mala, et ex frequenti usu et tandem habitu illa inducant naturae, et sic in prolem 
suam per hereditarium transcribunt; nam quod parentes ex actuali vita per frequentem usum imbuunt, hoc irradicatur eorum naturae, et transfertur hereditario in posteritatem, quae nisi reformatur 
seu regeneratur, continuatur illud in generationes, et tunc semper accrescit; inde voluntas proclivior ad mala et falsa.  Sed cum Ecclesia consummatur et perit, tunc Dominus semper novam alicubi exsuscitat 
sed raro, si unquam, ex homine prioris Ecclesiae, verum a gentibus quae in ignorantia fuerunt; de his in sequentibus nunc agitur. @1 cujus$ @2 quo$ @3 after solum$ </p>
