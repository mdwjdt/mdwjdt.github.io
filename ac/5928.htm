<h3 align="center" class="ired">属天的奥秘 第5928节</h3>
<h4 align="center"></h4><p><strong>5928.</strong>“便雅悯也在他的颈项上哭”表接受和随之的回应。这从以下事实清楚可知：这是一种回应的重复行为；所以它表示接受和随之的回应。至于良善与真理的结合，以及真理与良善回应的结合，要知道，当良善流入真理，并与它们结合时，它会将来自它自己的良善注入它们，由此使它们依附在自己身上；然后，这二者便结合在一起。由于当这种情况发生时，真理便获得生命，所以此后，它们在回应或对良善作出反应时，看似独立行动。然而，这些真理并非独立行动，而是通过流入良善的良善行动，这良善自己将所流入的良善依附于真理。此中情形就像活体中的血管。当血液涌入之前的空血管时，它便激活它们。血管之所以回应，是因为它们从血液获得运动能力，可以说获得生命。由此可见良善与真理的结合，以及真理与良善回应的结合是怎么回事。</p>

<p align="center"><b>Potts(1905-1910) 5928</b></p><p><b>5928.</b>
And Benjamin wept upon his necks. That this signifies reception and thence reciprocity, is evident from the fact that this was done mutually; wherefore it denotes reception and reciprocity. As regards 
the conjunction of good with truths, and the reciprocal conjunction of truths with good, be it known that when good flows into truths and conjoins them with itself, it pours into them good from its 
own, and by means of its own attaches them to itself, whence comes the conjunction. And as truths thus receive life, it afterward appears as if they act from themselves, when they act reciprocally or 
react. Nevertheless truths do not act from themselves, but from the good which flows into the good attached by itself to the truths. The case herein is like the blood vessels in a living body. Truths 
are as it were the vessels without the blood; but good is as it were the blood; when this pours itself into the vessels which before were empty, it sets them in motion, and also in reciprocal motion, 
for they have received from the blood a capacity of moving, and as it were life. From all this it is evident how the case is with the conjunction of good with truths, and with the reciprocal conjunction 
of truths with good. </p>

'And Benjamin wept on his neck' means an acceptance and reciprocal response. This is clear from the fact that it is an action repeated in return, and is therefore an acceptance and reciprocal response. 
As regards the joining of good to truths, and the responsive joining of truths to good, it should be recognized that when good flows into truths and joins them to itself it does so by pouring good 
into them from itself and thereby attaching them to itself, and then the two are joined together. Now because when this happens the truths receive life they appear after that to act independently when 
they act in response, or react to the good. Nevertheless the truths do not act independently but are moved by the good flowing into the good which was added from itself to the truths. It is like the 
blood vessels in a living body. The truths are like those vessels without blood in, them, whereas the good is like the blood itself. When the blood pours itself into the vessels which previously were 
empty it activates them. The vessels respond, because from the blood they receive motion and so to speak life. From all this one may see what is implied by the joining of good to truths, and the responsive 
joining of truths to good. </p>

`Et Benjamin flevit super collis illius': quod significet receptionem et inde reciprocum, constat ex eo quod vicissim hoc factum, unde est receptio et inde reciprocum. Quod conjunctionem boni cum veris, 
et verorum reciprocum cum bono attinet, sciendum cum influit bonum in vera et sibi illa conjungit, quod tunc infundat illis bonum ex suo, et per suum {1}addicet {2}illa sibi, inde conjunctio; et 
quia vera sic vitam {3}accipiunt, apparet dein sicut agant ex se, cum reciproce agunt seu reagunt, at usque vera non agunt ex se sed ex bono quod influit in bonum a se addicatum veris; se habent {4}haec 
sicut vasa sanguinis in corpore vivo, vera sunt quasi vasa absque sanguine, bonum autem est quasi sanguis, hic cum se infudit in vasa quae prius vacua fuerunt, agit illa; et quoque reciproce, a sanguine 
enim acceperunt movendi facultatem, et quasi vitam. Ex his {5} patet quomodo se habet cum conjunctione boni cum veris, et cum [conjunctione] verorum cum bono reciproca. @1 addicat$ @2 vera$ @3
