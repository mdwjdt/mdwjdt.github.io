<h3 align="center" class="ired">属天的奥秘 第987节</h3>
<h4 align="center"></h4><p><strong>987.</strong>“地上的一切牲畜”表属于低心智（lower mind）的欲望。这从圣言中“牲畜”的含义清楚可知，牲畜或表情感，或表恶欲。对良善的情感用温驯、有用和洁净的牲畜来表示，而对邪恶，即恶欲的情感则用凶猛、无用、不洁的牲畜来表示（参看<a href="45.htm">45</a>，<a href="46.htm">46</a>，<a href="142.htm">142</a>-<a href="143.htm">143</a>，<a href="246.htm">246</a>，<a href="776.htm">776</a>节）。它们表恶欲，故被称为“地上的牲畜”，而非田野的牲畜。至于重生之人战胜恶欲，要清醒地认识到，人们若以为他们能凭自己战胜邪恶，就大错特错了，并且也决不会重生。因为人无非是邪恶，他就是一大堆邪恶，他的整个意愿只在于邪恶，这在前一章已阐明，即“人心的妄想从小就是邪恶”（8:21）。活生生的经历向我表明，一个人或精灵，甚至天使，就其本身，即他的整个自我中心而言，不过是最龌龊的排泄物；若由着他自己，他只会呼吸仇恨、报复、残忍和最淫秽的通奸，这些事物都是他自己的，就是构成其意愿的东西。<br />人若反思一下，谁都能通过以下考虑清楚明白这一点：人出生时，在所有野兽和牲畜中，他是最低级的活物；他长大并变得自主后，若没有外在法律的束缚和他为了名利强加于自己的约束，他必冲进一切罪恶，并且不会罢手，直到他征服全世界的人，攫取全世界的财富；除了那些臣服于他，成为他卑微的奴隶之人，他也不会饶恕任何人。这就是每个人的本性，尽管那些没有机会，也没有能力尝试的人，或那些受制于上述约束的人没有意识到这一点。但是，一旦得到机会和能力，并且放松约束，他们就会竭尽全力冲向这些行为。野兽却从未表现出这样的本性，它们生在某种属世的秩序中。那些捕食性的猛兽只在自卫时才会去伤害其它动物；它们吞食其它动物也只是为了缓解饥饿，一旦得到满足，它们不会伤害任何人。然而，人类却完全不同。由此清楚可知人的自我中心和意愿是何性质。<br />由于人如此邪恶和龌龊，故显而易见，他凭自己不可能战胜邪恶。邪恶战胜邪恶，并且不仅战胜邪恶，还战胜地狱，这纯粹是一个悖论。因为每个人都通过恶灵与地狱相联，他里面的邪恶由此被激活。谁都能由此知道，并且凡头脑正常的人都能推论出，唯独主战胜人里面的邪恶和居于他身上的地狱。为了能征服人里面的邪恶，即时时刻刻奋力强行进入人内，并永远毁灭他的地狱，人被主重生，并被赋予一个新意愿，就是良知，主通过这良知运行一切良善。以下是信的要点：人无非是恶，一切善皆来自主。因此，人不但应该知道这些要点，还应承认和相信它们。如果他在世时不承认也不相信，那么在来生会有力地向他显明。</p>

<p><strong>[NCE]987.</strong> The fact that on every beast of the earth means over cravings in the lower mind is established by the symbolism of a beast in the Word. There beasts symbolize passions, or cravings. Beasts that are tame, useful, and clean symbolize passions for something good. Beasts that are savage, useless, and unclean symbolize passions for evil, or cravings.{*1} For more on this, see <a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_987/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_45" target=_top>45</a>, <a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_987/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_46" target=_top>46</a>, <a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_987/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_142" target=_top>142</a>, <a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_987/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_143" target=_top>143</a>, <a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_987/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_246" target=_top>246</a>, <a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_987/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_776" target=_top>776</a>.<br />Because they symbolize cravings here, they are called beasts of the earth, not beasts of the field.<br />In respect to the mastery exercised by regenerate people over their cravings, everyone needs to realize the tremendous error and totally unregenerate nature of people who imagine that they can subdue evil by their own efforts. Human beings are nothing but evil. We are a mass of evils. Our whole will is unmitigated evil. That is why <a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_987/bible_king-james-version_genesis_8_21" target=_top>Genesis 8:21</a> said, "What human hearts fabricate is evil from their youth."<br />Personal experience has shown me that people and spirits — and even angels, viewed in themselves (that is, their whole selfhood) — are the most worthless excrement. It has also shown me that when left to themselves, all they meditate is hatred, vengefulness, cruelty, and the foulest adulteries. These are their own impulses; these are their will.<br />[2] Anyone can see the same thing simply by musing on this, that at birth we are the basest living creatures among all the wild animals and beasts. After growing up and coming into our own, we would plunge into atrocities of every kind if various restraints did not stop us — external legal restraints, and restraints we place on ourselves in seeking to grow as influential and rich as possible. We would not stop until we had overpowered every person in the universe and raked up everyone's wealth. We would spare none but those who submitted to us as lowly slaves. That is what each of us is like, although we do not perceive it when we have no opportunity or power to achieve it, and when we are under restraint, as mentioned. If opportunity and ability presented themselves and the restraints were loosened, we would run just as wild as we could.<br />Animals are not at all the same. They are born into a kind of preordained system of nature. The savage predators among them do hurt other animals, but only to protect themselves; and when they eat other animals, they are satisfying their hunger. Once satisfied, they inflict no more harm. Humans are completely different.<br />These things demonstrate what human selfhood and human will are like.<br />[3] Since we are such a horrible, massive heap of wickedness and dung, we obviously have no ability whatever to conquer evil on our own. It is absolutely self-contradictory to say that evil can control evil, and not only that it can control evil but that it can control hell. Each of us communicates with hell by means of evil spirits, and it is this contact that arouses the evil in us.<br />From this anyone can see or (if sane) come to the conclusion that only the Lord can control the evil and the hell we harbor within.<br />In order to subdue the evil in us — or in other words, to subdue hell, which spends every second trying to attack and destroy us forever — the Lord regenerates us and gives us the gift of a new will, which is conscience. Through it, the Lord alone achieves every positive result.<br />Faith teaches that we are nothing but evil and that everything good is from the Lord, so we must not only learn it but also acknowledge and believe it. If we do not acknowledge and believe it in this life, it will be vividly demonstrated to us in the other life.<br /><br /><strong>Footnotes:</strong><br />{*1} The "tame, useful, and clean" animals mentioned in the Bible, also referred to as "beasts of the field," include sheep, goats, and cattle; the "savage, useless, and unclean" animals, also referred to as "beasts of the earth," include bears, wolves, scorpions, serpents, and mice (<a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_987/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_2180#subsection-2-2" target=_top>2180:2</a>, <a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_987/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_3218" target=_top>3218</a>). Although the application of negative terms to animals may surprise today's readers, who are more likely to assess animals with respect to their ecological function than their symbolic function, Swedenborg's human-dependent assessment of animals is consistent with his human-centric theology: animals are classed as either useful or useless depending exclusively on their direct impact on humans. Furthermore, Swedenborg states that the signification of animals in the Bible correlates with the meaning of animals as they appear in the spiritual world — that is, as spontaneous representations of the emotions and thoughts of spirits and angels. It follows from this that "every animal symbolizes a characteristic that falls into one of the categories of human qualities" (<a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_987/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_10042#subsection-2-2" target=_top>10042:2</a>).

Upon every beast of the earth. That this signifies over the cupidities of the lower mind, is evident from the signification of "beasts" in the Word, where they signify either affections or cupidities, 
affections of good being signified by gentle, useful, and clean beasts; and affections of evil, or cupidities, by those that are fierce, useless, and unclean (concerning which see above, n. 45, 46, 
142, 143, 246, 776). Here, as cupidities are signified, they are called "beasts of the earth" not beasts of the field. With regard to the rule of the regenerate man over cupidities, it is to be known 
that those are in the greatest error, and are by no means the regenerate, who believe that they can of themselves rule over evils. For man is nothing but evil; he is a mass of evils; all his will being 
merely evil; which is what is said in the preceding chapter (8:21): that "the imagination of man's heart is evil from his youth." It has been shown me by living experience that a man and a spirit, even 
an angel, in himself regarded, that is, as to all that is his own, is but vilest excrement; and that left to himself he breathes nothing but hatred, revenge, cruelty, and most foul adultery.  [2] 
These things are his own; these are his will; as must also be evident to everyone if he reflects, merely from this, that man when born is, among all wild animals and beasts, the vilest creature living. 
And when he grows up and becomes his own master, if not hindered by outward bonds of the law, and bonds which he imposes on himself for the purpose of gaining great honor and wealth, he would rush 
into every crime, and not rest until he had subjugated all in the universe, and raked together the wealth of all in the universe; nor would he spare any but those who submitted to be his humble servants. 
Such is the nature of every man, although those are unaware of it who are powerless and to whom such attempts are impossible, and also those who are in the bonds above mentioned. But let the possibility 
and power be given, and the bonds be relaxed, and they would rush on to the extent of their ability. Wild animals never show such a nature. They are born into a certain order of their nature. Those 
which are fierce and rapacious inflict injury on other creatures, but only in self-defense; and their devouring other animals is to allay their hunger, and when this is allayed they do harm to none. 
But it is altogether different with man. From all this it is evident what is the nature of man's Own and will.  [3] Since man is such mere evil and excrement, it is evident that he can never of himself 
rule over evil. It is an utter contradiction for evil to be able to rule over evil, and not only over evil, but also over hell; for every man is in communication through evil spirits with hell, 
and thereby the evil in him is excited. From all this everyone may know, and he who has a sound mind may conclude, that the Lord alone rules over evil in man and over hell with him. In order that the 
evil in man may be subjugated, that is, hell, which strives every moment to rush in upon him and destroy him forever, man is regenerated by the Lord and endowed with a new will, which is conscience, 
through which the Lord alone performs all good. These are points of faith: that man is nothing but evil; and that all good is from the Lord. They are therefore not only known by man, but also acknowledged 
and believed; and if he does not so acknowledge and believe in the life of the body, it is shown him to the life in the life to come. </p>

<p align="center"><b>Elliott(1983-1999) 987</b></p><p><b>987.</b>
'Upon every beast of the earth' means the desires that belong to the lower mind. This is clear from the meaning of 'beast' in the Word, where beasts mean either affections or else evil desires. Affections 
for what is good are meant by gentle, useful, and clean beasts, while affections for what is evil, that is, evil desires, are meant by savage, useless, and unclean ones - see <a href="45.htm">45</a>, <a href="46.htm">46</a>, <a href="142.htm">142</a>, <a href="143.htm">143</a>, <a href="246.htm">246</a>, <a href="776.htm">776</a>. Because here they mean evil desires they are called 'beasts of the earth', not beasts of the field. As for a regenerate person's rule over evil desires, it should be recognized that people err 
very greatly and are in no sense regenerate who believe they are able to rule over evils from themselves. For a human being is nothing but evil, he is one mass of evils, and his whole will consists 
solely in evil. This was stated in the previous chapter - 'the imagination of man's heart is evil from his childhood', 8:21. I have been shown by actual experience that a man or a spirit, and even an 
angel, regarded in himself, that is, as to his entire proprium, is vilest excrement, and left to himself breathes out nothing but hatred, revenge, cruelty, and most filthy adultery. These are the things 
that are his own, and are the things which constitute his will. </p>
<p></p>
<p><b>[2]</b>
 This matter also becomes clear to anyone if he reflects, merely from the consideration that when a person is born he is the lowest 
thing alive among all wild animals and beasts. And when he grows up and becomes responsible for his own actions he would rush into every kind of ungodliness but for external legal restraints and 
the restraints he imposes on himself to the end that he may become pre-eminent and very wealthy. He would not rest content until he had made everyone throughout the world subject to himself and had raked 
in the wealth of everyone in it. He would spare no one except those who surrendered to him as his mere slaves. Such is the nature of everyone, though those people do not recognize it who do not have 
the opportunity and ability to behave in that way, or who are subject to the restraints mentioned above. But once the opportunity and ability have been provided and the restraints have been loosened, 
they would plunge themselves, as far as they were able, into such actions. Wild animals never demonstrate natures such as this, but are born into a certain natural order. Those that are savage beasts 
of prey do inflict harm on other animals, yet only in self-defence; and their devouring of other creatures is so that they may satisfy their hunger. And once that is satisfied they harm none. The human 
being however is altogether different. From this it is clear what man's proprium is and what his will is. </p>
<p></p>
<p><b>[3]</b>
 Since a person is just so much evil and excrement, it is clear that he cannot possibly 
from himself rule over evil. To say that evil can rule over evil is an utter contradiction. And this applies not only to ruling over evil but also over hell, for everybody is in communication with 
hell by means of evil spirits, and it is from that source that the evil residing with him is activated. From these considerations anyone may know, and he who is mentally normal may conclude, that it 
is the Lord alone who rules over evil residing with man and over hell residing with him. So that the evil residing with a person, that is, hell which is trying moment by moment to force its way into 
him and destroy him eternally, may be overpowered, a person is regenerated by the Lord and has a new will conferred on him, which is conscience, and through which the Lord alone works everything good. 
These considerations are matters of faith, that is to say, the considerations that man is nothing but evil and that everything good comes from the Lord. A person ought therefore not merely to know them 
but also acknowledge and believe them. If he does not acknowledge and believe during his lifetime, it is demonstrated to him convincingly in the next life. </p>

Quod 'super omnem bestiam terrae' significet super cupiditates quae sunt animi, constat a significatione 'bestiae' in Verbo, ubi per illas significantur vel affectiones vel cupiditates; affectiones 
boni per bestias mites, utiles, mundas; affectiones mali seu cupiditates per bestias immites, inutiles, immundas; de quibus videatur n. 45, 46, 142, 143, 246, 776: hic quia significant cupiditates, vocantur 
'bestiae terrae,' non bestiae agri.  Quod dominium hominis regenerati super cupiditates attinet, sciendum quod in maximo errore sint et nusquam regenerati, qui credunt quod possint ex se dominari 
super mala; homo enim non est nisi malum, est congeries malorum, omnis ejus voluntas est mere malum; quod est quod dictum, cap. praec. viii 21, 'figmentum cordis hominis est malum a pueritia ejus'. 
Ostensum mihi est per vivam experientiam quod homo et spiritus, immo angelus, in se spectatus, hoc est, omne ejus proprium, sit vilissimum excrementum; et quod sibi relictus non spiret nisi odia, vindictas, 
crudelitates et adulteris foedissima; haec sunt ejus propria et haec sunt ejus voluntas: [2] quod etiam unicuivis si reflectit, constare potest solum ex eo quod homo dum nascitur, est vilissimum 
vivum inter omnes feras et bestias; et cum adolescit ac sui juris fit, nisi vincula externa quae sunt legis, et vincula quae sibi facit ut maximus sit et ditissimus, impedirent, rueret in omne nefas, 
nec quiesceret priusquam omnes in universo subjugaverit et omnium in universo opes corraserit, nec parceret ulli nisi qui se ut servos viles submitteret; talis est unusquisque homo, tametsi ii non 
percipiunt qui in impossibilitate et impotentia sunt et qui in vinculis illis, de quibus dictum; sed data possibilitate et potentia, et relaxatis vinculis, tantam ruerent quantum possent: ferae nusquam 
sunt tales; hae nascuntur in quendam naturae ordinem; quae immites et rapaces sunt, inferunt aliis malum, sed modo se tutandi causa; et quod devorent alias, est ut sedent famem, qua sedata nulli nocent: 
sed aliter prorsus homo: inde constat quid proprium hominis et quid ejus voluntas.  [3] Cum homo tale et tantum malum et excrementum est, constat quod nusquam ex se dominari possit super malum; contradictorium 
prorsus est quod malum dominari possit super malum; nec solum super malum sed et super infernum; nam unusquisque homo per malos spiritus communicat cum inferno, inde malum quod apud eum, 
excitatur: ex his unusquisque scire, et qui sanae mentis est, concludere potest quod solus Dominus sit Qui dominatur super malum apud hominem et super infernum quod apud hominem.  Ut subjugari queat 
malum apud hominem, hoc est, infernum quod unoquovis momento irruere in hominem conatur et eum in aeternum perdere, homo a Domino regeneratur, et nova voluntate quae est conscientia, donatur, per quam 
Dominus solus operatur omne bonum.  Haec sunt fidei, nempe quod homo non sit nisi malum, et quod omne bonum a Domino; quare homo illa non solum sciet sed etiam agnoscet et credet; si non in vita corporis 
agnoscit et credit, in altera vita ei ad vivum ostenditur. </p>
