<h4 align="center"></h4><p><strong>1723.</strong>“在沙微谷，沙微谷就是王谷”表那时外在人在良善与真理方面的状态。这从“沙微谷”和“王谷”的含义清楚可知：“沙微谷”表外在人的良善，“王谷”表外在人的真理。外在人被称为“谷”，是因为它在下面。更外在之物也相对更低，就象更内在之物也相对更高。“王”表真理，这在前面早已说明（<a href="1672.htm">1672</a>节）。</p>

<p><strong>[NCE]1723.</strong> The symbolism of to the valley of Shaveh, that is, the king's valley, as the state at that point of the goodness and truth in the outer self can be seen from the symbolism of the valley of Shaveh and of the king's valley. The valley of Shaveh symbolizes goodness in the outer self, and the king's valley, truth there.<br />The outer self is called a valley because it lies below. Anything that is more superficial is also lower, just as anything that is deeper is also higher.<br />The symbolism of a king as truth was mentioned earlier, in <a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_1723/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_1672" target=_top>1672</a>. </p>
<p align="center"><b>Potts(1905-1910) 1723</b></p><p><b>1723.</b>
At the valley of Shaveh, this is the king's valley. That this signifies the state of the external man as to goods and truths at that time, may be seen from the signification of "the valley of Shaveh," 
and also of "the king's valley." "The valley of Shaveh" signifies the goods of the external man; and "the king's valley" signifies the truths of the same. The external man is called a "valley" from 
the fact that it is below. That which is more external is also lower, as that which is more internal is also higher. That a "king" signifies truth, has been said before (n. 1672). </p>

<p align="center"><b>Elliott(1983-1999) 1723</b></p><p><b>1723.</b>
'At the valley of Shaveh, which is the king's valley' means the state of the External Man as regards goods and truths at that time. This becomes clear from the meaning of 'the valley of Shaveh' and also 
of the 'king's valley'. 'The valley of Shaveh' means the goods of the External Man, 'the king's valley' the truths of the same Man. The External Man is called 'a valley' on account of its being below. 
That which is more external is also lower, just as that which is more internal is also higher. That 'a king' means truth has been stated already in <a href="1672.htm">1672</a>. </p>

<p align="center"><b>Latin(1748-1756) 1723</b>
</p><b>1723.</b>
'Ad vallem Shaveh, haec vallis regis': quod significet statum Externi Hominis quoad bona et vera tunc, constare potest a significatione 'vallis Shaveh,' tum 'vallis regis'; 'vallis Shaveh' significat 
Externi Hominis bona, 'vallis regis' ejusdem vera. Externus homo dicitur 'vallis' ex eo quod infra sit; quod exterius, id quoque est inferius, sicut quod interius, id quoque est superius: quod 'rex' 
significet verum, dictum est prius n. 1672. </p>
