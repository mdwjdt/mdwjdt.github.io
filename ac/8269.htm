<h3 align="center" class="ired">属天的奥秘 第8269节</h3>
<h4 align="center"></h4><p><strong>8269.</strong>“（这是我的神，）我要为祂预备一个住处”表在来源于祂自己的良善里面，祂就如同在祂的天堂里面。这从“一个住处”的含义清楚可知，当论及耶和华或主时，“一个住处”是指良善。“主的住处”之所以表示良善，是因为一切良善皆来源于主；因此，良善是主的，并且完全是主的，以致可以说主是良善。当主住在这良善里面时，祂就住在祂的神性里面。祂也不可能住在别处，正如祂自己在约翰福音中所说的：<br />耶稣说，人若爱我，就必遵守我的话；我父也必爱他，并且我们要到他那里去，与他同住。（约翰福音<a href="http://39-27.cn/约14.23.htm">14:23</a>）<br />源于神的良善就是此处“爱主，遵守祂的话”所描述的，因为良善来自爱；经上说“他们要与他同住”，意思是说在良善里面与他同住。之所以说“如同在祂的天堂里面”，是因为天堂由于以下事实而被称为“神的住处”：源于主的良善在那里构成天堂。此外，主还在每个人里面如同在祂的天堂里面；那时，祂在那里的良善里面；因为人里面的天堂就是良善，人通过良善而与天堂里的天使同在。由此明显可知，“（这是我的神，）我要为祂预备一个住处”表示在来源于祂自己的良善里面，祂就如同在祂的天堂里面。</p>

And I will prepare Him a habitation. That this signifies that in the good which is from Him, He shall be as in His heaven, is evident from the signification of "a habitation," when said of Jehovah or 
the Lord, as being good. That "the habitation of the Lord" denotes good, is because all good is from the Lord, thus good is the Lord's, insomuch that it may be said that the Lord is good, and when the 
Lord dwells in this, He dwells in His Divine, nor can He dwell anywhere else, according to His own words in John: </p>
<p>     Jesus said, If anyone love me, he keepeth My word; and My Father loveth him, and 
We will come unto him, and make an abode with him (14:23); </p>
<p>good from the Divine is here described by "loving the Lord and keeping His word," for good is of love; it is said that "they will make an 
abode with him," that is, in the good with him. It is said "as in His heaven," because heaven is called "the habitation of God" from the fact that good, which is from the Lord, is there and constitutes 
heaven. Moreover the Lord is in every man as in His heaven when He is in good there; for man's heaven is good, and through good man is with the angels in heaven. From this it is now evident that by 
"I will prepare Him a habitation" is signified that in the good which is from Him, He will be as in His heaven. </p>

<p align="center"><b>Elliott(1983-1999) 8269</b></p><p><b>8269.</b>
'[This is my God,] and I will establish a dwelling-place for Him' means that when He is within good, which originates in Himself, He will be as if in His heaven. This is clear from the meaning of 'a 
dwelling-place', when it has reference to Jehovah or the Lord, as good. The reason why 'the Lord's dwelling-place' means good is that all good has its origin in the Lord; thus good is the Lord's, so completely 
that one may say it is the Lord. When the Lord dwells within it He dwells within His Divinity. Nor can He dwell anywhere else, according to the Lord's words in John, </p>
<blockquote>
Jesus said, If anyone 
loves Me He keeps My word, and My Father loves him, and We will come to him and make Our home with him. <a href="http://bible.gospelcom.net/cgi-bin/bible?passage=John%2014:23&amp;version=ESV&amp;interface=print&amp;showfn=yes&amp;showxref">John 14:23</a>. 
</blockquote>
<p>Good that springs from God is what 'loving the Lord and keeping His word' describes 
here; for good comes from love. 'With him', it says, 'They would make Their home', which means within good residing with him. The expression 'as in His heaven' is used because heaven is called God's 
dwelling-place; and it is called this because good, which originates in the Lord, exists there and constitutes heaven. The Lord is also within the individual person as in His heaven when He is within 
good there; for the heaven within a person is good, and through good a person is present with angels in heaven. From all this it is now evident that 'I will establish a dwelling-place for Him' means 
that when He is within good, which originates in Himself, He will be as if in His heaven. </p>

`Et habitaculum constituam Illi': quod significet quod in bono quod ab Ipso, erit ut in Suo caelo, constat ex significatione `habitaculi,' cum de Jehovah seu Domino dicitur, quod sit bonum; quod `habitaculum 
Domini' sit bonum, est quia omne bonum est {1}a Domino, ita bonum est Domini, adeo ut dici possit quod Dominus sit bonum; in hoc cum Dominus habitat, in Suo Divino habitat, nec alibi habitare 
potest, secundum Domini verba apud Johannem, Jesus dixit, Si quis amaverit Me, verbum Meum servat, et Pater Meus amat illum, et ad illum veniemus, et mansionem apud illum faciemus, xiv (x)23; </p>
<p>bonum 
ex Divino (t)hic describitur per `amare Dominum, et {2}servare verbum Illius,' nam bonum est amoris {3}; apud illum dicitur quod `mansionem facerent,' hoc est, in bono apud illum.  Ut in Suo caelo dicitur 
quia caelum vocatur `habitaculum Dei,' ex eo quia bonum, quod a Domino, est ibi, et constituit caelum; Dominus etiam in unoquovis homine est ut in Suo caelo, cum in bono ibi, nam caelum hominis 
est bonum, et homo per bonum est apud angelos in caelo; inde nunc patet quod per `habitaculum constituam Illi' significetur quod in bono quod ab Ipso, erit ut in Suo caelo. 	@1 Domini, et quia est Domini, 
est Dominus in bono, et quoque est bonum, et Dominus non potest habitare nisi in suo Divino, et cum apud hominem est in Divino quia in bono quod ab Ipso$ 	@2 verbum Ipsius servare$ 	@3 i et obedientiae$ </p>
