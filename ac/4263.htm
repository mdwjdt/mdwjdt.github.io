<h3 align="center" class="ired">属天的奥秘 第4263节</h3>
<h4 align="center"></h4><p><strong>4263.</strong>“母山羊二百只，公山羊二十只，母绵羊二百只，公绵羊二十只”表神性良善和伴随的真理。这从“母山羊”、“母绵羊”和“公山羊”、“公绵羊”的含义清楚可知：“母山羊”和“母绵羊”是指良善（参看<a href="3995.htm">3995</a>，<a href="4006.htm">4006</a>，<a href="4169.htm">4169</a>节）；“公山羊”和“公绵羊”是指真理（<a href="4005.htm">4005</a>，<a href="4170.htm">4170</a>节），在此是指神性良善与真理。之所以多次提及良善与真理，并以许多不同事物来表示它们，是因为天堂和教会的一切事物都与它们有关；爱与仁的一切事物与良善有关，信的一切事物与真理有关。然而良善的属和种不计其数，事实上无穷无尽；这一点从以下事实明显看出来：所有处于良善的人都在主的国度里面；然而，在那里，没有哪两个社群，甚至一个社群中没有哪两个个体处于一样的良善。因为同一种良善存在于两个个体中是绝无可能的，更不可能存在于许多人里面，否则，就只有同一种，而没有两种，更不会有许多种了。每一个整体都是由各个部分组成的，并且通过天上的和谐一致来组成。</p>

Two hundred she-goats and twenty he-goats, two hundred ewes and twenty rams. That this signifies goods and thence truths Divine, is evident from the signification of "she-goats" and of "ewes" as being 
goods (see n. 3995, 4006, 4169); and from the signification of the "he-goats" and "rams" as being truths (n. 4005, 4170); here, goods and truths Divine. That goods and truths are mentioned so many times, 
and are signified by so many various things, is because all the things of heaven and of the church have reference thereto; the things of love and charity to goods, and the things of faith to truths. 
But still the differences among them as to genera and as to species are innumerable, and indeed endless, as is evident from the fact that all who are in good are in the Lord's kingdom; and yet no 
society there, nor indeed an individual in a society, is in the same good as another. For one and the same good is never possible with two, and still less with many, for in this case these would be one 
and the same, and not two, still less many. Everyone consists of various things, and this by heavenly harmony and concord. </p>

<p align="center"><b>Elliott(1983-1999) 4263</b></p><p><b>4263.</b>
'Two hundred she-goats and twenty he-goats; two hundred sheep and twenty rams' means Divine goods and accompanying truths. This is clear from the meaning of 'she-goats and sheep' as goods, dealt with 
in <a href="3995.htm">3995</a>, <a href="4006.htm">4006</a>, <a href="4169.htm">4169</a>; from the meaning of 'he-goats and rams' as truths, dealt with in <a href="4005.htm">4005</a>, <a href="4170.htm">4170</a>, in this case Divine goods and truths. The reason why goods and truths are mentioned so many times, and 
why they are meant by so many different things, is that everything in heaven or in the Church has a relationship with them - everything of love and charity with good, and everything of faith with truth. 
Yet the genera and species of good and truth are countless, indeed limitless, as becomes clear from the fact that all who are governed by good are within the Lord's kingdom and yet good is not one 
and the same with one community as it is with another, nor is it even one and the same with one individual within a community as it is with another. For it is by no means possible for one and the same 
good to exist in two individuals, still less in many, for if one and the same good existed in them, there would not even be two, let alone many of them. Every single whole consists of varying parts, 
doing so through heavenly harmony and concord. </p>

`Capras ducentas et capros viginti, oves ducentas et arietes viginti': quod significet bona et inde vera Divina, constat ex significatione `caprarum et ovium' quod sint bona, de qua n. 3995, 4006, 
4169; ex significatione `caprarum et arietum' quod sint vera, de qua n. 4005, 4170; hic bona et vera Divina. Quod bona et vera toties nominentur, et per tot varia significentur, est quia omnia quae 
caeli sunt et quae Ecclesiae, se referunt {1} ad illa, illa quae amoris et charitatis sunt, ad bona, et illa quae fidei, ad vera; sed usque sunt differentiae illorum quoad genera et quoad species, 
innumerabiles, immo indefinitae, ut constare potest ex eo quod omnes qui in bono sunt, in regno Domini sint, et usque nulla societas ibi in simili bono est, ne quidem unus in societate {2} in simili 
ac alter; unum enim [et] idem bonum apud duos nusquam dari potest, minus apud plures, tunc enim unum et idem forent, non duo, minus plures; ex variis consistit omne unum, et hoc per caelestem harmoniam 
et concordiam.      @1 referant AI$      @2 after alter$ </p>
