<h3 align="center" class="ired">属天的奥秘 第10375节</h3>
<h4 align="center"></h4><p><strong>10375</strong>.“祂在西乃山和摩西说完了话，就把两块法版交给他”表主通过圣言与一个人的结合。这从“摩西”的代表，以及“和他说完了话”、“西乃山”、“两块版”和“法版”的含义清楚可知：“摩西”是指圣言（参看<a href="9372.htm">9372</a>节提到的地方）；“和他说完了话”是指一切事物都已经设立之后，因为耶和华在西乃山上对摩西所说的，都是要在以色列人当中设立的事物，因而都是教会的事物；“西乃山”是指天堂，就是神性真理所来自的地方（<a href="8805.htm">8805</a>，<a href="9420.htm">9420</a>节）；“两块版”是指整体上的法律，因而是指圣言（<a href="9416.htm">9416</a>节）；“法版”是指神性真理方面的主（<a href="8535.htm">8535</a>，<a href="9503.htm">9503</a>节）。通过圣言与一个人的结合由以下事实来表示：版在数量上是两块，并照着一个约的样式联结在一起（<a href="9416.htm">9416</a>节）；“二或两”表示联结或结合（<a href="5194.htm">5194</a>，<a href="8423.htm">8423</a>节）。由此明显可知，“耶和华在西乃山和摩西说完了话，就把两块法版交给他”表示教会建立之后，主与一个人的结合就通过由祂那里从天而降的圣言实现了。对人来说，主通过圣言流入，与他交谈并与他结合（参看<a href="1775.htm">1775</a>，<a href="2310.htm">2310</a>，<a href="2899.htm">2899</a>，<a href="3476.htm">3476</a>，<a href="3735.htm">3735</a>，<a href="3982.htm">3982</a>e，<a href="4217.htm">4217</a>，<a href="9212.htm">9212</a>e，<a href="9216.htm">9216</a>e，<a href="9357.htm">9357</a>，<a href="9380.htm">9380</a>，<a href="9396.htm">9396</a>，<a href="9400.htm">9400</a>，<a href="9401.htm">9401</a>，<a href="10290.htm">10290</a>节）。</p>

And He gave unto Moses, in His completing to speak with him on Mount Sinai, the two tables of the Testimony. That this signifies the conjunction of the Lord with man through the Word, is evident from 
the representation of Moses, as being the Word (concerning which see the places cited in n. 9372); from the signification of "in completing to speak with him," as being after all things had been instituted, 
for the things which Jehovah spoke with Moses on Mount Sinai were those which were to be instituted among the sons of Israel, thus which were of the church; from the signification of "Mount Sinai," 
as being heaven, whence comes Divine truth (n. 8805, 9420); from the signification of "the two tables," as being the Law in the whole complex, thus the Word (n. 9416); and from the signification 
of "the Testimony," as being the Lord as to Divine truth (n. 8535, 9503). Conjunction thereby with man is signified by the tables being two, and being joined together according to the likeness of a covenant 
(n. 9416); by "two" being signified conjunction (n. 5194, 8423). Thus it is plain that by the words, "Jehovah gave unto Moses, in completing to speak with him on Mount Sinai, the two tables of 
the Testimony," is signified that after the church has been set up, there is conjunction of the Lord with man through the Word, which has been sent down from Him out of heaven. (That it is the Word through 
which the Lord flows in with man, speaks with him, and is conjoined with him, see n. 1775, 2310, 2899, 3476, 3735, 3982, 4217, 9212, 9216, 9357, 9380, 9396, 9400, 9401, 10290.) </p>

'And He gave to Moses, when He had finished talking to him from Mount Sinai, the two tablets of the Testimony' means a joining of the Lord to a person by means of the Word. This is clear from the representation 
of 'Moses' as the Word, dealt with in the places referred to in <a href="9372.htm">9372</a>; from the meaning of 'when He had finished talking to him' as after all things had been instituted, for what Jehovah talked 
about to Moses on Mount Sinai was the things to be instituted among the children of Israel, thus things of the Church; from the meaning of 'Mount Sinai' as heaven, where Divine Truth comes from, 
dealt with in <a href="8805.htm">8805</a>, <a href="9420.htm">9420</a>; from the meaning of 'the two tablets' as the law in its entirety, thus the Word, dealt with in <a href="9416.htm">9416</a>; and from the meaning of 'the Testimony' as the Lord in respect of Divine 
Truth, dealt with in <a href="8535.htm">8535</a>, <a href="9503.htm">9503</a>. The joining to a person by means of the Word is meant by the fact that the tablets were two in number and were joined together as if by a covenant, see <a href="9416.htm">9416</a>. 'Two' furthermore 
means a joining together, <a href="5194.htm">5194</a>, <a href="8423.htm">8423</a>. From all this it is evident that 'Jehovah gave to Moses, when He had finished talking to him from Mount Sinai, the two tablets of the Testimony' means that 
after the Church has been established a joining of the Lord to a person is accomplished by means of the Word sent down from Him out of heaven.  </p>
<p>The Word is the means by which the Lord flows in with 
a person, talks to him, and is joined to him, see <a href="1775.htm">1775</a>, <a href="2310.htm">2310</a>, <a href="2899.htm">2899</a>, <a href="3476.htm">3476</a>, <a href="3735.htm">3735</a>, <a href="3982.htm">3982</a>(end), <a href="4217.htm">4217</a>, <a href="9212.htm">9212</a>(end), <a href="9216.htm">9216</a>(end), <a href="9357.htm">9357</a>, <a href="9380.htm">9380</a>, <a href="9396.htm">9396</a>, <a href="9400.htm">9400</a>, <a href="9401.htm">9401</a>, <a href="10290.htm">10290</a>.  </p>

`Et dedit ad Moschen in absolvendo Ipso ad loquendum cum illo e monte Sinai, duas tabulas testimonii': quod significet conjunctionem Domini per Verbum cum homine, constat ex repraesentatione `Moschis' 
quod sit Verbum, de qua in locis citatis n. 9372; ex significatione `in absolvendo loqui cum illo' quod sit postquam omnia instituta sunt, nam quae Jehovah cum Mosche in monte Sinai locutus est, erant 
quae instituenda apud filios Israelis, ita quae Ecclesiae; ex significatione `montis Sinai' quod sit caelum, unde Divinum Verum, de qua n. 8805, 9420; ex significatione `duarum tabularum' quod sint 
lex in omni complexu, ita Verbum, de qua n. 9416; et ex significatione `testimonii' quod sit Dominus quoad Divinum Verum, de qua n. 8535, 9503; conjunctio per illud cum homine significatur per quod 
tabulae binae essent, et conjunctae ad instar foederis, videatur n. 9416, etiam per duo significatur conjunctio, n. 5194, 8423; inde patet quod per `dedit Jehovah ad Moschen in absolvendo Ipso ad loquendum 
cum illo e monte Sinai duas tabulas testimonii' significetur quod postquam Ecclesia instaurata est, conjunctio Domini cum homine sit per Verbum, quod ab Ipso e caelo demissum. Quod Verbum sit per 
quod Dominus influit apud hominem, loquitur cum illo et conjungitur illi, videatur n. 1775, 2310, 2899, 3476, 3735, 3982 fin., 4217, 9212 fin., 9216 fin., 9357, 9380, 9396, 9400, 9401, 10,290. </p>
