<h3 align="center" class="ired">属天的奥秘 第8869节</h3>
<h4 align="center"></h4><p><strong>8869.</strong>“不可为自己造雕像”表没有自我聪明的产物。这从“雕像”的含义清楚可知，“雕像”是指并非来自主，而是来自人的自我之物。“雕像”表示人自己的理解力的产物，“铸像”表示人自己的意愿的产物。以这一个或那一个为神，或崇拜它就是爱从自我发出的一切胜过其它任何事物。这样做的人根本不信他们的任何聪明和智慧是从神性流入的；因为他们将一切事都归于自己；将发生在他们身上的其它一切事要么归因于运气，要么归因于机遇；完全否认神在这类事上的旨意。他们以为，即便有某种更高的神力存在，它也存在于自然的秩序中，他们将一切事物都归因于自然秩序。诚然，他们口头上会说，某个造物主，神已经将这类事物印在自然秩序上；但心里却不肯承认任何高于自然秩序的神。这就是那些发自内心将一切事物归于自己和自己的睿智、聪明，丝毫不归于神性之人的样子。他们当中那些爱自己的人崇拜自己的能力，还想得到其他人的崇拜，甚至被拜为神；若不是教会禁止，这些人会公然做出这种事来。这些人就是造雕像的，而雕像本身就是他们从自己的理解力和意愿孵化出来，并想要被拜为神性事物的东西。<br />在圣言中，“雕像”表示这些事物，这一点从提到它们的经文明显看出来，如耶利米书：<br />各人都因知识变得愚蠢；凡铸金属的，都因他的雕像羞愧。他的铸像本是虚假的，其中并无气息。（耶利米书<a href="http://39-27.cn/耶10.14.htm">10:14</a>；<a href="http://39-27.cn/耶51.17.htm">51:17</a>）<br />由于“雕像”表示并非从主发出，而是从自我聪明发出之物，故经上说“人都因知识变得愚蠢；凡铸金属的，都因他的雕像羞愧”；由于从自我聪明孵化出来的东西没有任何唯独来自主的属灵生命在里面，故经上又说“其中并无气息”。<br />哈巴谷书：<br />雕像有什么益处呢？制造者雕刻它，铸像就是虚谎的师傅；因为造像的在制造哑巴神明时，倚靠他自己所造的东西；其中毫无气息。（哈巴谷书<a href="http://39-27.cn/哈2.18.htm">2:18</a>，<a href="http://39-27.cn/哈2.19.htm">19</a>）<br />此处“雕像”表示那些从自我聪明孵化出来的事物，其中毫无来自主的生命。<br />耶利米书：<br />有干旱临到她的众水，它们就必乾涸；因为这是有雕像之地，他们因偶像而夸耀。所以野猫和野狗，并猫头鹰的女儿也住在其中。（耶利米书<a href="http://39-27.cn/耶50.38.htm">50:38</a>，<a href="http://39-27.cn/耶50.39.htm">39</a>）<br />这论及迦勒底和巴比伦；“有干旱临到众水，它们就必乾涸”表示根本没有生命在里面的真理；“野猫和野狗，并猫头鹰的女儿”表示邪恶和虚假，因而表示那些里面属于死亡的东西；这就是为何经上说“雕像之地”。<br />以赛亚书：<br />制造雕像的尽都虚空；他们所喜悦的都无益处。他们给自己作见证，毫无所见，毫无所知。（以赛亚书<a href="http://39-27.cn/赛44.9.htm">44:9</a>-<a href="http://39-27.cn/赛44.11.htm">11</a>）<br />“制造雕像的”表示那些孵化教义的人，这些教义不是取自圣言的真理的产物，而是自我聪明的产物；论到这种教义，经上说“他们所喜悦的都无益处”、“他们毫无所见，毫无所知”。本章12-16节经文继续论述了出于自我聪明发明观念并利用推理孵化它们的技巧，他们想让这些观念被视为神性。关于这些事，经上最后如此说：<br />他用剩下的做了一神，就是他的雕像；他向它俯伏叩拜，他们不知道，也不思想；他们的眼看不见，他们的心不明白。（以赛亚书<a href="http://39-27.cn/赛44.17.htm">44:17</a>，<a href="http://39-27.cn/赛44.18.htm">18</a>）<br />“他们不知道，不思想，看不见”表示真理和良善不在里面，因为从自我聪明出来的一切事物内在都没有真理或良善在里面，只有虚假和邪恶；它们是从人的自我发出来的。从根本上说，自我就是邪恶（参看<a href="210.htm">210</a>，<a href="215.htm">215</a>，<a href="694.htm">694</a>，<a href="874.htm">874</a>-<a href="876.htm">876</a>，<a href="987.htm">987</a>，<a href="1023.htm">1023</a>，<a href="1044.htm">1044</a>，<a href="1047.htm">1047</a>，<a href="1581.htm">1581</a>，<a href="3812.htm">3812</a>e，<a href="4328.htm">4328</a>，<a href="5660.htm">5660</a>，<a href="5786.htm">5786</a>，<a href="8480.htm">8480</a>）。<br />同一先知书：<br />你们究竟将谁比神，用什么形像与祂比较呢？匠人铸造雕像，金匠用金包裹它，为它铸造银链。穷乏献不起这样供物的，就拣选一块不能朽坏的木头；为自己寻找巧匠，预备不能摇动的雕像。（以赛亚书<a href="http://39-27.cn/赛40.18.htm">40:18</a>-<a href="http://39-27.cn/赛40.20.htm">20</a>）<br />“匠人所铸造的雕像”表示源于自我的虚假教义；“金匠用金包裹它，为它铸造银链”表示它利用推理来使这些教义中的虚假看似真理。<br /><br />我耶和华凭公义召你，开瞎子的眼，领被囚的出牢狱，领坐在黑暗中的出牢房。我是耶和华，这是我的名。我必不将我的荣耀归给别人，也不将我的称赞归给雕像。（以赛亚书<a href="http://39-27.cn/赛42.6.htm">42:6</a>-<a href="http://39-27.cn/赛42.8.htm">8</a>）<br />这些话论及主，祂是耶和华，一切智慧皆源于祂，丝毫源于人。此处论述主，这是显而易见的。祂是“耶和华”，这也是显而易见的；因为经上说“耶和华凭公义召祂”，然后说“我是耶和华，这是我的名。我必不将我的荣耀归给别人”。祂“开瞎子的眼，领被囚的出牢狱，领坐在黑暗中的出牢房”表示与生活有关的一切智慧皆源于祂；“我必不将我的称赞归给雕像”表示智慧丝毫不源于人。<br />在以下经文中，“雕像”也表示属于自我聪明的观念：<br />人的战车，一对一对的马兵前来。他就回应说，巴比伦倾倒了！他所有的一切雕像都打碎于地。（以赛亚书<a href="http://39-27.cn/赛21.9.htm">21:9</a>）<br />以赛亚书：<br />你要审判不洁的银雕像的包裹物和金铸像的衣服；你要扔掉它们，好像污秽之物；它必叫做粪块。（以赛亚书<a href="http://39-27.cn/赛30.22.htm">30:22</a>）<br />耶利米书：<br />他们为什么以雕像和外邦的偶像或虚空，惹我发怒呢？（耶利米书<a href="http://39-27.cn/耶8.19.htm">8:19</a>）<br />何西阿书：<br />他们呼召自己，为了自己而去；他们向诸巴力献祭，给雕像烧香。（何西阿书<a href="http://39-27.cn/何11.2.htm">11:2</a>）<br />申命记：<br />制造耶和华所憎恶的雕像或铸像，就是工匠手工的，那人必受咒诅。（申命记<a href="http://39-27.cn/申27.15.htm">27:15</a>）</p>

<p align="center"><b>Potts(1905-1910) 8869</b></p><p><b>8869.</b>
Thou shalt not make unto thee a graven image. That this signifies not from self-intelligence, is evident from the signification of "a graven image," as being that which is not from the Lord, but from 
what is man's own. That which is man's own of his intellect is signified by "a graven image," and that which is man's own of his will is signified by "a molten image." To have either the one or the other 
for a god, or to adore it, is to love above all things all that which proceeds from self. They who do this entirely disbelieve that anything of intelligence and wisdom flows in from the Divine, for 
they attribute all things to themselves; everything else that happens to them they ascribe either to fortune or to chance. They totally deny the Divine Providence in such things. They suppose that 
if there is anything of Deity present, it is in the order of nature, to which they ascribe all things. They do indeed say with their lips that some Creator God has impressed such things upon nature; but 
still in their heart they deny any God above nature. Much are they who from the heart attribute everything to themselves and to their own sagacity and intelligence, and nothing to the Divine; and those 
of them who love themselves, adore what belongs to themselves and also desire to be worshiped by others, even as gods, and would do so openly if the church did not forbid. These are the formers of 
graven images, and the graven images themselves are what they hatch from their own, and wish to be adored as things divine.  [2] That these things are signified in the Word by "graven images," is evident 
from the passages where they are mentioned, as in Jeremiah: </p>
<p>     Every man is become a fool from knowledge; every founder is put to shame by his graven image; for his molten image is a lie, and 
there is no breath in them (Jer. 10:14; 51:17); </p>
<p>as by "a graven image" is signified that which does not proceed from the Lord, but from self-intelligence, therefore it is said, "Every man is become 
a fool from knowledge, and every founder is put to shame by his graven image;" and as in those things which are hatched from self-intelligence there is nothing of spiritual life, which is solely from 
the Lord, therefore it is also said, "and there is no breath in them."  [3] In Habakkuk: </p>
<p>     What profiteth the graven image that the maker thereof hath graven it, the molten image, and the teacher 
of a lie, because the maker of his invention trusteth upon this, when he maketh dumb gods? there is no breath in the midst of it (Hab. 2:18, 19); here the "graven image" denotes those things which are 
hatched from self-intelligence, wherein there is nothing of life from the Lord. [4] In Jeremiah: </p>
<p>     A drought is upon her waters, and they shall be dried up; for it is a land of graven images, 
and they glory in horrors; therefore the ziim dwell with the iim, and the daughters of the owl dwell therein (Jer. 1:38. 39); </p>
<p>speaking of Chaldea and Babel; "a drought upon the waters, and they shall 
be dried up," denotes truths wherein there is nothing of life; "the ziim, and the iim, and the daughters of the owl, dwell therein," denotes evils and falsities, thus those things which are of death 
within; from this it is that they are called "a land of graven images."  [5] In Isaiah: </p>
<p>     They that fashion a graven image are all of them vanity; and their most desirable things shall not profit; 
and they are witnesses to themselves, they see not nor know (Isa. 44:9-11); </p>
<p> "they that fashion a graven image," denotes those who hatch out doctrines which are not grounded in truths from the Word, 
but in self-intelligence, of which doctrines it is said that "their most desirable things do not profit," and that "they see not nor know." In what follows (verses 12-16 of that chapter) there is treated 
of the art of inventing and of hatching by reasonings from self-intelligence, things which they desire should be acknowledged as Divine, of which things it is thus finally said: </p>
<p>     The residue 
thereof he maketh into a god, his graven image, he adoreth it, he boweth himself down, and yet they know not, neither do they understand; and their eyes do not see, that their hearts may not understand 
(Isa.44:17, 18); </p>
<p>that "they know not, and understand not, and see not" denotes that truths and goods are not within, for all things which go forth from self-intelligence are not inwardly truths and 
goods, but falsities and evils, because they proceed from one's own, and that this at its root is evil, see n. 210, 215, 694, 874-876, 987, 1023, 1044, 1047, 1581, 3812, 4328, 5660, 5786, 8480.  [6] 
In the same: </p>
<p>     To whom will ye liken God? and what image will ye compare with Him. The craftsman casteth the graven image, and the founder overlayeth it with gold, and casteth silver chains. He 
that is destitute of an oblation chooseth wood that will not rot; he seeketh him a wise craft man to prepare a graven image that shall not be shaken (Isa. 40:18-20); </p>
<p>"the graven cage which the craftsman 
casteth" denotes false doctrine which is from man's own; "the founder overlayeth it with gold, and casteth silver chains," denotes that through reasonings he makes the falsities of doctrine appear 
as truths.  [7] In the same: </p>
<p>     I Jehovah have called thee in righteousness, to open the blind eyes, to bring out the bound one from the prison, them that sit in darkness out of the prison-house. 
I am Jehovah, this is My name, and My glory will I not give to another, nor My praise to graven images (Isa. 42:6-8); </p>
<p>speaking of the Lord, that He is Jehovah, and that from Him is all wisdom, and 
nothing of it from man. That the Lord is here treated of is evident. That He is "Jehovah" here is also evident, for it is said that "Jehovah hath called Him in righteousness," and then, "I am Jehovah, 
this is My name, and My glory will I not give to another." That from Him is the wisdom that belongs to life, is signified by His "opening the blind eyes," and "bringing out the bound one from the prison, 
and them that sit in darkness out of the prison-house;" that nothing of wisdom is from man, is signified by "I will not give My praise to graven images." [8] By "graven images" are also signified 
the things of self-intelligence in the following passages: </p>
<p>     And there cometh a chariot of a man, a pair of horsemen. And he answered and said, Babel is fallen; and all the graven images he hath 
broken into the earth (Isa. 21:9).      Then will ye judge unclean the covering of the graven images of their silver, and the clothing of the molten image of their gold; thou shalt scatter them as a 
menstruous cloth; it shall be called dung (Isa. 30:22).      Why have they provoked Me to anger by their graven images, by vanities of strangers? (Jer. 8:19).      They have called themselves, so they 
went for the sake of themselves; they sacrifice to the Baals, and burn incense to graven images (Hos. 11:2).      Cursed be the man that maketh a graven or molten image, an abomination to Jehovah, 
the work of the hands of the craftsman (Deut. 27:15). </p>

<p align="center"><b>Elliott(1983-1999) 8869</b></p><p><b>8869.</b>
'You shall not make for yourself a graven image' means no product of self-intelligence This is clear from the meaning of 'a graven image' as that which does not come from the Lord but from a person's 
self. A product of one's own understanding is meant by 'a graven image', and a product of one's own will by 'a molded image'. Having either kind as a god or venerating it is loving all that comes from 
self more than anything else. People who do this do not at all believe that any of their intelligence or wisdom flows in from the Divine; for they attribute it all to themselves. And everything else 
happening to them which they cannot attribute to themselves they relate to fortune or to chance; they altogether refuse to recognize God's providence in such matters. They suppose that if some higher 
power is present it lies within the natural order, to which they ascribe all things. They do, it is true, say with their lips that some God and Creator has stamped such things on the natural order; but 
in their hearts they refuse to recognize any God higher than the natural order. This is what those people are like who at heart attribute everything to their own prudence and intelligence, and nothing 
to God. And those of them who love themselves venerate their own abilities. They also wish to be venerated by others, indeed to be venerated as gods, openly so if the Church did not forbid it. These 
are 'the makers of graven images', and the images themselves are what they hatch from their own understanding and will, and wish to be venerated as things that are Divine. </p>
<p></p>
<p><b>[2]</b>
 The fact that those 
things are meant by 'graven images' in the Word is clear from places where they are mentioned, as in Jeremiah, </p>
<blockquote>
Every person has been made stupid by knowledge; every metal-caster has been filled with 
shame by his graven image, for his molded image is a lie; and there is no spirit in those things. <a href="http://bible.gospelcom.net/cgi-bin/bible?passage=Jer%2010:14;%2051:17&amp;version=ESV&amp;interface=print&amp;showfn=yes&amp;showxref">Jer 10:14; 51:17</a>. 
</blockquote>
<p>Because 'a graven image' means that which does not originate in the Lord but 
is a product of self-intelligence, the words 'every person has been made stupid by knowledge' and 'every metal-caster has been filled with shame by his graven image' are therefore used. And because what 
is hatched from self-intelligence does not have within it any spiritual life, which comes solely from the Lord, the words 'and there is no spirit in those things' are also therefore used. </p>
<p></p>
<p><b>[3]</b>
 In 
Habakkuk, </p>
<blockquote>
What profit is a graven image since its image-maker has graven it, a molded image and a teacher of lies, since the image-maker trusts in the thing he himself has made, when he makes dumb 
gods? It has no breath in it.<A name="fntext1"></a><A href="#fn1"><sup>a</sup></a> <a href="http://bible.gospelcom.net/cgi-bin/bible?passage=Hab%202:18-20&amp;version=ESV&amp;interface=print&amp;showfn=yes&amp;showxref">Hab 2:18-20</a>. 
</blockquote>
<p>Here 'a graven image' stands for what is hatched from self-intelligence and has no life at all from the Lord within it. </p>
<p></p>
<p><b>[4]</b>
 In Jeremiah, </p>
<blockquote>
A drought 
on its waters, and they will dry up! For it is the land of graven images, and they glory in idols.<A name="fntext2"></a><A href="#fn2"><sup>b</sup></a> Therefore the ziim dwell with the iim, and the daughters of the owl dwell in it. <a href="http://bible.gospelcom.net/cgi-bin/bible?passage=Jer%2050:38,%2039&amp;version=ESV&amp;interface=print&amp;showfn=yes&amp;showxref">Jer 50:38, 39</a>. 
</blockquote>
<p>This 
refers to Chaldea and Babel. 'A drought on its waters, and they will dry up' stands for truths that have no life at all in them, 'the ziim and the iim and the daughters of the owl dwell' stands 
for evils and falsities, and so for things which inwardly belong to death This is why the words 'the land of graven images' are used. </p>
<p></p>
<p><b>[5]</b>
 In Isaiah, </p>
<blockquote>
Makers of the graven image, all are vanity; 
and their most desirable things are profitless. And they are their own witnesses; they do not see, nor do they know. <a href="http://bible.gospelcom.net/cgi-bin/bible?passage=Isa%2044:9-11&amp;version=ESV&amp;interface=print&amp;showfn=yes&amp;showxref">Isa 44:9-11</a>. 
</blockquote>
<p>'Makers of the graven image' stands for those who hammer out teachings 
which are not products of truths from the Word but products of self-intelligence, in reference to which teachings the words 'their most desirable things are profitless' and 'they do not see, nor 
do they know' are used. Verses 12-16 of that chapter go on to refer to the art of conceiving ideas and of using reasonings to hatch them from self-intelligence - ideas which they wish to be recognized 
as Divine. Regarding these the following is said finally, </p>
<blockquote>
The rest of it he makes into a god, his graven image He venerates it, bows down [to it]. And yet they do not know or understand; and their 
eyes do not see, so that their hearts do not understand. <a href="http://bible.gospelcom.net/cgi-bin/bible?passage=Isa%2044:17,%2018&amp;version=ESV&amp;interface=print&amp;showfn=yes&amp;showxref">Isa 44:17, 18</a>. 
</blockquote>
<p>'They do not know, do not understand, and do not see' stands for the absence of truths and forms of good within; for inwardly 
nothing that is the outcome of self-intelligence has either truths or forms of good in it, only falsities and evils, since it is the outcome of the person's proprium. The fact that the proprium is 
fundamentally evil, see <a href="210.htm">210</a>, <a href="215.htm">215</a>, <a href="694.htm">694</a>, <a href="874.htm">874</a>-<a href="876.htm">876</a>, <a href="987.htm">987</a>, <a href="1023.htm">1023</a>, <a href="1044.htm">1044</a>, <a href="1047.htm">1047</a>, <a href="1581.htm">1581</a>, <a href="3812.htm">3812</a> (end), <a href="4328.htm">4328</a>, <a href="5660.htm">5660</a>, <a href="5786.htm">5786</a>, <a href="8480.htm">8480</a>. </p>
<p></p>
<p><b>[6]</b>
 In the same prophet, </p>
<blockquote>
To whom will you liken God, and what image will you compare 
with Him? The craftsman casts a graven image, and a goldsmith overlays it with gold and casts silver chains for it. Whoever is too impoverished to make this oblation<A name="fntext3"></a><A href="#fn3"><sup>c</sup></a> chooses a piece of wood that 
will not rot; he seeks for himself a wise craftsman to make ready a graven image that is immovable. <a href="http://bible.gospelcom.net/cgi-bin/bible?passage=Isa%2040:18-20&amp;version=ESV&amp;interface=print&amp;showfn=yes&amp;showxref">Isa 40:18-20</a>. 
</blockquote>
<p>'A graven image' cast by a craftsman stands for false teachings that spring from 
the self, and 'a goldsmith overlays it with gold and casts silver chains for it' stands for the fact that it uses reasonings to make the falsities in those teachings look like truths. </p>
<p></p>
<p><b>[7]</b>
 In the 
same prophet, </p>
<blockquote>
I Jehovah have called You in righteousness, to open the blind eyes, to bring the bound out of prison, out of the dungeon-house those who sit in darkness. I am Jehovah, that is My name; 
and My glory I will not give to another, nor My praise to graven images. <a href="http://bible.gospelcom.net/cgi-bin/bible?passage=Isa%2042:6-8&amp;version=ESV&amp;interface=print&amp;showfn=yes&amp;showxref">Isa 42:6-8</a>. 
</blockquote>
<p>These words refer to the Lord. They declare that He is Jehovah, that He is the Source of all wisdom, and that 
none at all springs from man. Their reference to the Lord is self-evident, as is the truth that He is Jehovah; for they declare that Jehovah has called Him in righteousness, and then 'I am Jehovah, 
that is My name; and My glory I will not give to another'. The truth that He is the Source of all wisdom which has to do with life is meant when it says that He is to open the blind eyes, bring the bound 
out of prison, and out of the dungeon-house those who sit in darkness; and the truth that no wisdom at all springs from man is meant by 'My praise I will not give to graven images'. </p>
<p></p>
<p><b>[8]</b>
 Ideas belonging 
to self-intelligence are also meant by 'graven images' in the following places: In Isaiah, </p>
<blockquote>
And there came the chariot of a man (vir), a pair of horsemen. And he answered and said, Babel has 
fallen; and all the graven images he has broken to the earth. <a href="http://bible.gospelcom.net/cgi-bin/bible?passage=Isa%2021:9&amp;version=ESV&amp;interface=print&amp;showfn=yes&amp;showxref">Isa 21:9</a>. 
</blockquote>
<p>In the same prophet, </p>
<blockquote>
Then you will judge unclean the covering of the graven images of your silver, and the clothing of 
the molded image of your gold. You will throw them away like a menstruous rag; a piece of dung it will be called. <a href="http://bible.gospelcom.net/cgi-bin/bible?passage=Isa%2030:22&amp;version=ESV&amp;interface=print&amp;showfn=yes&amp;showxref">Isa 30:22</a>. 
</blockquote>
<p>In Jeremiah, </p>
<p>Why have they provoked Me to anger through their graven 
images, through foreigners' idols?<A name="fntext4"></a><A href="#fn4"><sup>d</sup></a> <a href="http://bible.gospelcom.net/cgi-bin/bible?passage=Jer%208:19&amp;version=ESV&amp;interface=print&amp;showfn=yes&amp;showxref">Jer 8:19</a>. In Hosea, </p>
<blockquote>

`Non facies {1} tibi sculptile': quod significet non ex propria intelligentia, constat ex significatione `sculptilis' quod sit id quod non ex Domino sed ex proprio hominis; quod ex proprio intellectuali, 
significatur per `sculptile,' et quod ex proprio voluntario significatur per `fusile'; hoc aut illud pro deo habere seu adorare, est amare (o)omne id super omnia quod ab ipso procedit; qui hoc faciunt, 
prorsus non credunt quod a Divino aliquid intelligentiae (c)et sapientiae influat, tribuunt enim omnia sibi; cetera quae (o)sibi eveniunt referunt ad fortunam vel ad casum {2}; providentiam Divinam 
in talibus plane negant; putant [quod] si aliquid numinis sit quod adest, id sit in ordine naturae, cui ascribunt omnia; dicunt quidem ore quod aliquis Creator Deus impresserit talia naturae, sed 
usque corde negant aliquem Deum supra naturam; tales sunt qui sibi suaeque prudentiae et intelligentiae tribuunt omnia, et nihil Divino ex corde; et qui illorum se amant adorant sua, et ab aliis quoque 
volunt ut adorentur, immo sicut dii, aperte si non Ecclesia vetaret; hi sunt `formatores sculptilium,' ipsa sculptilia sunt quae ex proprio excludunt, ac volunt ut adorentur pro Divinis; [2] quod 
illa per `sculptilia' in Verbo significentur, constat ex locis ubi nominantur, ut apud Jeremiam, 	Stultus factus est omnis homo a scientia, pudore affectus est omnis conflator a sculptili, quia mendacium 
fusile ejus, neque spiritus in eis, x 14, li 17; </p>
<p>quia per `sculptile' significatur id quod non a Domino, sed a propria intelligentia procedit, ideo dicitur `stultus factus est omnis homo a scientia,' 
et `pudore affectus est omnis conflator a sculptili'; et quia in illis quae ex propria intelligentia excluduntur, nihil vitae spiritualis inest quae unice (o)est a Domino, ideo quoque dicitur, `neque 
spiritus in eis': [3] apud Habakuk, 	Quid prodest sculptile, quia sculpsit illud fabricator ejus, fusile et doctor mendacii, quia fidit fabricator figmenti sui super hoc, cum facit deos mutos? 
non spiritus in medio ejus, ii 18-20; </p>
<p>hic `sculptile' pro illis quae ex propria intelligentia excluduntur {3}, in quibus {4} nihil vitae a Domino: apud Jeremiam, 	Siccitas super aquas ejus et exarescent, 
quia terra sculptilium illa, et de horrendis gloriantur; ideo habitant ziim cum iim {5}, et habitant in ea filiae noctuae, l 38, 39; </p>
<p>ibi de Chaldaea et Babele; `siccitas super aquas et exarescent' 
pro veris in quibus nihil vitae, `habitant ziim et iim, et filiae noctuae' pro malis et falsis, ita illa quae mortis sunt intus; inde est quod dicantur `terra sculptilium': [5] apud Esaiam, 	Formatores 
sculptilis omnes vanitas, et desideratissima illorum non prosunt, et testes sibi ipsi, non vident nec cognoscunt, xliv 9-11; </p>
<p>`formatores sculptilis' pro illis qui excudunt doctrinas {6} quae non 
ex veris e Verbo sed quae ex propria intelligentia, de quibus dictum quod `desideratissima illorum non prosint {7},' et quod {8} `non videant nec cognoscant'; agitur ibi in sequentibus vers. 12-16 
illius capitis de arte fingendi et per ratiocinia excludendi ex propria intelligentia, quae volunt ut agnoscantur pro Divinis; de quibus sic demum dicitur, 	`Residuum ejus in deum facit, in sculptile 
suum, adorat illud, incurvat se, et tamen non cognoscunt neque intelligunt; et non vident oculi illorum, ut non intelligant corda illorum, vers. (x)17, 18; </p>
<p>quod `non cognoscant, {9} non intelligant, 
et non videant' pro quod (x)non vera et bona insint, nam omnia quae ex propria intelligentia exeunt intus non sunt vera ac bona sed falsa et mala, exeunt enim ex proprio illius; quod hoc radicitus malum 
sit, videatur n. 210, 215, 694, 874-876, 987, 1023, 1044, 1047, 1581, 3812 fin., 4328, 5660, 5786, 8480 {10}: [6] apud eundem, 	Cui assimilabitis Deum, et quam imaginem componetis cum Illo? sculptile 
fundit artifex, et conflator auro obducit illud, et catenas argenti conflat; destitutus oblatione lignum non putrescet eligit; artificem sapientem quaerit sibi, ad praeparandum sculptile, non commoveatur, 
xl 18-20; </p>
<p>`sculptile quod fundit artifex' pro doctrina falsa quae {11} ex proprio, `conflator auro obducit, et catenas argenti conflat,' pro quod per {12} ratiocinia faciat ut falsa doctrinae 
appareant vera {13}: [7] apud eundem, 	Ego Jehovah vocavi te in justitia, ad aperiendum oculos caecos, ad educendum e carcere vinctum, e domo claustri sedentes tenebris; Ego Jehovah, hoc nomen Meum, 
et gloriam Meam alteri non dabo, nec laudem Meam sculptilibus, xiii 6-8; </p>
<p>ibi de Domino, quod ille `Jehovah,' et quod ab Ipso omnis sapientia et nihil ab homine; quod de Domino ibi agatur, patet; quod 
Ipse ibi [sit] `Jehovah,' etiam patet, nam dicitur quod `Jehovah vocavit Ipsum in justitia,' et dein `Ego Jehovah, hoc nomen Meum, et gloriam Meam alteri non dabo'; quod ab Ipso omnis sapientia quae 
vitae, significatur per quod `aperturus oculos caecos, et educturus e carcere vinctum, et e domo claustri sedentes tenebris'; quod nihil sapientiae ab homine, significatur per quod `laudem Meam non 
dabo {14} sculptilibus.' 	[8] Per `sculptilia' etiam significantur {15} quae propriae intelligentiae sunt in sequentibus his locis: apud Esaiam, 	Et venit currus viri, par equitum, et respondit, et 
dixit, Cecidit Babel, et omnia sculptilia confregit in terram, xxi 9: </p>
<p>apud eundem, 	Tunc immundum judicabitis tegmen sculptilium argenti tui {16}, et amictum fusilis auri tui {16}, disperges ea sicut 
(x)menstruatum, stercus vocabitur id, xxx 22: </p>
<p>apud Jeremiam, 	Quare ad iram provocarunt Me per sculptilia sua, per vanitates alienigenarum? viii 19: </p>
<p>apud Hoscheam, 	Vocaverunt seipsos, sic iverunt 
propter se ipsos; balibus sacrificant, et sculptilibus suffiunt, xi 2: </p>
<p>apud Moschen, 	Maledictus vir qui fecerit sculptile aut fusile, abominationem Jehovae, opus manuum artificis, Deut. xxvii 15. @1
