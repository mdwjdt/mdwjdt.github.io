<h4 align="center"></h4><p><strong>1450.</strong>“从那里他又迁到伯特利东边的山”表主孩童时的第四个状态。这从上下文，以及次序本身清楚可知。这次序就是主理应自婴幼儿时首先充满爱的属天事物。爱的属天事物就在于爱耶和华、爱邻舍，以及这些爱中的纯真本身。从这些事物，如同从生命之泉那样流出所有其它事物，无论总体还是细节，因为所有其它事物只不过是衍生物。这些属天事物主要在人自婴幼儿到童年早期的状态中被植入到人里面，事实上没有认知。因为在人知道何为爱、何为情感之前，它们就从主流入并感染他，如婴幼儿，以及童年早期的状态所显示的。人里面的这些事物就是数次提及的余留，这些余留被主植入，并储存起来，以便用于他以后的生活（对此，可参看<a href="468.htm">468</a>，<a href="530.htm">530</a>，<a href="560.htm">560</a>，<a href="561.htm">561</a>，<a href="660.htm">660</a>，<a href="661.htm">661</a>节）。由于主象其他人那样出生，所以祂也按照次序、自婴幼儿直到童年一步步被引入属天事物，之后被引入认知。主所经历的这些事物就是本节所描述的，也是下文“亚伯兰寄居在埃及”所代表的。</p><br />

<p><strong>[NCE]1450.</strong> The fact that he moved from there onto a mountain to the east of Bethel symbolizes the Lord's fourth state as a youth can be seen from what comes above and below and so from the course of progress being described as well. Following that course, the Lord absorbed the heavenly aspects of love first of all, starting in infancy. The heavenly aspects are love for Jehovah, love for one's neighbor, and the innocence that marks both. Absolutely everything else flows from those attributes, which function as the actual fountains of life, since nothing else is more than a branch of that stream.<br />These heavenly traits are infused in us principally at the stage of childhood, from infancy up to adolescence. They are not infused along with any knowledge, because they filter in from the Lord and affect us before we have any idea what love is, or what an emotion is, as can be seen from the state of babies and then of children. In us such traits are called a remnant, and the Lord instills it in us and stores it away for use at later stages of our life. This remnant has been discussed several times before; for more on it, see 搂搂<a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_1450/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_468" target=_top>468</a>, <a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_1450/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_530" target=_top>530</a>, <a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_1450/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_560" target=_top>560</a>, <a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_1450/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_561" target=_top>561</a>, <a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_1450/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_660" target=_top>660</a>, <a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_1450/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_661" target=_top>661</a>.<br />Since the Lord was born like any other person, he was also led into heavenly capacities in orderly stages, from childhood to adolescence, and later into knowledge. The nature of the knowledge that he had is depicted in the current verse and is represented below by Abraham's stay in Egypt.{*1} <br /><strong>Footnotes:</strong><br />{*1} The story of the stay in Egypt starts in <a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_1450/bible_king-james-version_genesis_12_10" target=_top>Genesis 12:10</a> (搂<a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_1450/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_1459" target=_top>1459</a>), although Abram has not as of that point been renamed Abraham (on this renaming, see note 1 in 搂<a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_1450/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_1545" target=_top>1545</a>).

And he removed from thence into the mountain on the east of Bethel. That this signifies the Lord's fourth state when a child, is evident from what precedes and from what follows, and also from the order 
itself. The order was that the Lord should first of all be imbued from infancy with the celestial things of love. The celestial things of love are love to Jehovah and love to the neighbor, and innocence 
itself in these. From these, as from the veriest fountains of life, flow all other things both in general and particular, for all other things are merely derivations. These celestial things are 
insinuated into man chiefly in his state of infancy up to childhood, and in fact without knowledges; for they flow in from the Lord, and affect him, before the man knows what love is and what affection 
is; as may be seen from the state of infants, and afterwards from the state of early childhood. These things in man are the remains which have been spoken of several times; and which are insinuated 
by the Lord and stored up for use in afterlife (concerning which see n. 468, 530, 560, 561, 660, 661). As the Lord was born as are other men, He was also introduced according to order into celestial 
things, and in fact by degrees from infancy to childhood, and afterwards into knowledges; and how the case was with Him in regard to these is described in this verse, and is represented in what follows 
by Abraham's sojourn in Egypt. </p>

'He removed from there to the mountain on the east of Bethel' means the Lord's fourth state when He was a boy. This becomes clear from what comes before and after, thus also from the train of thought 
itself, namely this: The Lord had first of all to be endowed from infancy with the celestial things of love - the celestial things of love consisting in love towards Jehovah and love towards the neighbour, 
and in innocence itself present in those loves. From these, as from the very sources of life, flows every single thing, for all other things are simply derivatives. These celestial things are implanted 
in a person chiefly in the state of infancy through to childhood, and in fact independently of cognitions; for they flow in from the Lord and stir that person with affection before he knows what 
love is or what affection is, as the infant state shows, and after that the state of early childhood. Those things with man are the 'remnants' that have been referred to several times which are implanted 
by the Lord and stored away for use in his later life. For these matters, see <a href="468.htm">468</a>, <a href="530.htm">530</a>, <a href="560.htm">560</a>, <a href="561.htm">561</a>, <a href="660.htm">660</a>, <a href="661.htm">661</a>. Since the Lord was born as any other is born, He too was introduced according to order 
into celestial things, step by step from infancy on into childhood, and after that into cognitions. These things as experienced by the Lord are described in the present verse, and represented in those 
that follow by Abram's sojourning in Egypt. </p>

'Transtulit inde in montem ab oriente Betheli':  quod significet quartum statum Domini cum puer, constare potest ab illis quae praecedunt, tum ab illis quae sequuntur, ita etiam ex ipso ordine; ordo 
fuit, quod Dominus omnium primum ab infantia imbutus fuisset caelestibus amoris; caelestia amoris sunt amor erga Jehovam et amor erga proximum et in illis ipsa innocentia; ex illis ut ab ipsismet fontibus 
vitae fluunt omnia et singula, sunt enim cetera solum derivationes.  Caelestia haec insinuantur imprimis homini in statu ejus infantiae usque ad pueritiam, et quidem absque cognitionibus; influunt 
enim a Domino et afficiunt, antequam homo sciat quid amor et quid affectio, ut constare potest a statu infantum et dein a statu primae pueritiae; haec apud hominem sunt 'reliquiae' de quibus aliquoties, 
quae a Domino insinuantur et reconduntur ad usum vitae ejus sequentis de quibus videatur n. 468, 530, 560, 561, 660, 661.  Dominus quia natus est sicut alius homo, etiam secundum ordinem in caelestia 
introductus est, et quidem per gradus ab infantia ad pueritiam, et dein in cognitiones, quae quomodo se habuerunt apud Ipsum, in hoc versu describitur, et in sequentibus repraesentatur per Abrahami 
peregrinationem in Aegypto. </p>
