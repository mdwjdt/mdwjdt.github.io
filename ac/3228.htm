<h3 align="center" class="ired">属天的奥秘 第3228节</h3>
<h4 align="center"></h4><p><h4 align="center">第25章</h4><br />3228.本章论述的主题是基土拉给亚伯拉罕所生的儿子，以及以实玛利的儿子，经上提到了他们的名字。之后经上又论述了以撒和利百加，因为以扫和雅各就是他们生的，最后论述了以扫因为一碗豆汤而卖了自己长子的名分。谁都能看出这些细节具有这样的性质，即它们的确有助于展现那个时代教会的历史，但对于属灵生命却几乎没什么价值，而圣言就是为属灵生命而存在的。知道谁是基土拉给亚伯拉罕所生的的儿子，谁是以实玛利的儿子，以及以扫因打猎累昏了，想要豆汤，而这时雅各却狡猾地以豆汤换取了长子的名分，对人有什么益处呢？下一章也一样，在那里经上说，亚米比勒的牧人与以撒的牧人因他们所挖的井而起了争竞，和以前与亚伯拉罕的牧人起争竞一样（创世记21章）。此外，有些地方只列举了一些名字，如36章列举了以扫的后代，其它章节也一样。由于这些是历史叙述，它们里面所包含的神性如此之少，以致你绝不会说圣言就每一句话，甚至一笔一划而言都是神性的启示，也就是说，圣言从主经由天堂传到写它的这一位那里。因为凡从主那里传下来的，每一个部分都是神性。因此，历史叙述没有任何神性可言，因为它们都是人作的事，除非这些历史凭借所包含的、深藏在它们里面的事，并且所有这些事，无论总体还是细节，论述的都是主及其国度。圣言的历史与全世界所有其它历史着作截然不同，远远胜过它们，因为圣言的历史就包含这类事物在里面。  </p>

CHAPTER 25 This chapter treats of the sons of Abraham by Keturah, and also of the sons of Ishmael, whose names are given; afterwards it treats of Isaac and Rebekah, in that Esau and Jacob were born 
to them, and finally that Esau sold his birthright to Jacob for a pottage of lentils. Everyone can see that these subjects are of such a nature as may indeed be of use for the church history of that time, 
but are of little value in regard to spiritual life, for the sake of which however the Word is given. What does it benefit a man to know who were the sons of Abraham by Keturah, and who were the 
sons of Ishmael? and that Esau, weary with hunting, craved the pottage of lentils, and that Jacob by means of it shrewdly procured the birthright for himself? And so in the following chapter, where it 
is said that the herdsmen of Abimelech quarreled with the herdsmen of Isaac concerning the wells they had dug, in about the same way as they had previously contended with the herdsmen of Abraham (chapter 
21). Moreover in some places there are mere lists of names, as that of the posterity of Esau (chapter 26); and the same in other chapters. Insofar as these are historical matters there is so little 
of the Divine in them that you can in no wise say that that Word was Divinely inspired in regard to every expression, and even to every jot, that is, that it had been sent down from the Lord through 
heaven to the man who wrote it; for what has been sent down from the Lord is Divine in all things both in general and in particular. Thus there is nothing Divine in regard to historical things (since 
these are transactions of men) except from things contained deeply hidden in the historicals, all of which both in general and in particular treat of the Lord and His kingdom. The historicals of the 
Word are unlike all other historicals in the universe, in that they contain such things within them. </p>

<p align="center"><b>Elliott(1983-1999) 3228</b></p><p><b>3228.</b><a href="25.htm">25</a> </p>
<p>The subject in this chapter is the sons of Abraham by Keturah, and then also the sons of Ishmael, who are mentioned by name. After that Isaac and Rebekah are referred to - that is, the birth of 
Esau and Jacob to them; and finally a description is given of how Esau sold his birthright to Jacob for lentil pottage. Anyone may see that these details are such as do indeed serve to present that period 
in the history of the Church, but that they are of little use where spiritual life is concerned, for the sake of which the Word exists. What value is it to anyone if he knows who the sons were that 
were born to Abraham by Keturah, and who that were born to Ishmael; and also if he knows that Esau, when exhausted from hunting, desired the lentil pottage, and that Jacob by being crafty in that 
situation acquired the birthright in exchange for that pottage? Similarly with the next chapter. What value is it to anyone if he knows that Abimelech's herdsmen disputed with Isaac's over the wells which 
they had dug, in almost the same way as they had done previously with Abraham's herdsmen in Chapter <a href="21.htm">21</a>? In addition some places include mere lists of names, as in Chapter <a href="36.htm">36</a>, where the descendants 
of Esau are listed. And the same is true with every other chapter. As historical narratives they contain so little of the Divine that you cannot possibly refer to them as that Word which is Divinely 
inspired as to every word and even to every jot - that is, the Word which was sent down from the Lord by way of heaven to the one who wrote those things. For what has been sent down from the Lord is 
Divine in every single part. Thus, being the exploits of men, the historical descriptions are not Divine, except by virtue of the things which are contained deeply concealed within those descriptions, 
every single one of which has regard to the Lord and His kingdom. In embodying such things within them the historical narratives of the Word are quite different from and superior to all other historical 
writings in all the world. </p>

GENESEOS CAPUT VIGESIMUM QUINTUM </p>
<p>Agitur in hoc capite de filiis Abrahami ex Keturah; tum quoque de filiis Jishmaelis, qui nominantur; postea de Jishako et Rebecca, quod illis nati Esau et Jacob; 
et demum quod Esau vendiderit primogenituram Jacobo pro pulte lentium: quisque videre potest quod haec talia sint ut quidem inserviant historiae Ecclesiasticae illius temporis, sed quod parum vitae spirituali, 
pro qua tamen est Verbum: quid homini, si sciat quinam filii Abrahamo ex Keturah, et quinam Jishmaeli; tum quoque quod Esau lassus ex venatione desideravit pultem lentium, et quod Jacobus ex 
calliditate tunc pro illa sibi comparaverit primogenituram? Similiter in capite sequente, quod pastores {1}Abimelechi cum pastoribus Jishaki rixati sint de puteis quos foderunt, paene similiter ac {2}cum 
pastoribus Abrahami prius cap. xxi? praeter quod aliquibus in locis sint merae recensiones nominum, ut posterorum Esavi, cap. xxxvi; et sic in reliquis; in quibus quatenus historica sunt, tam parum 
Divini est ut neutiquam dicere possis quod Verbum illud quoad omnem vocem, etiam quoad omnem iotam, divinitus inspiratum sit, hoc est, quod a Domino per caelum ad hominem qui illa scripsit, demissum; 
quod enim a Domino demissum est, illud est Divinum in omnibus et singulis, ita non quoad historica, quia illa sunt res gestae hominum, nisi ex illis quae in historicis penitus abdita continentur, 
quorum omnia et singula agunt de Domino, (c)et de Ipsius regno; historica Verbi prae omnibus aliis historicis in universo terrarum orbe, id singulare habent, quod talia involvant. @1 Jischaki et Abimelechi$ 
 @2 prius xxi pastores Abrahami$  </p>
