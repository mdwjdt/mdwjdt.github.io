Verses 34-40. When Esau heard the words of his father, he cried with an exceeding great and bitter cry, and said unto his father, Bless me, me also, O my father. And he said, Thy brother came with fraud, 
and hath taken away thy blessing. And he said, Is it not that his name is called Jacob? And he hath supplanted me these two times; he hath taken away my birthright, and behold now he hath taken away 
my blessing. And he said, Hast thou not reserved a blessing for me? And Isaac answered and said unto Esau, Behold I have made him thy master, and all his brethren have I given to him for servants; 
and with corn and new wine have I sustained him; and what then shall I do for thee, my son? And Esau said unto his father, Hast thou but this one blessing, my father? Bless me, me also, O my father. 
And Esau lifted up his voice, and wept. And Isaac his father answered and said unto him, Behold of the fat things of the earth shall be thy dwelling, and of the dew of heaven from above. And upon thy 
sword shalt thou live, and shalt serve thy brother; and it shall come to pass when thou shalt have the dominion that thou shalt break his yoke from upon thy neck. [2] "When Esau heard the words of his 
father" signifies the observation of natural good from Divine good; "he cried with an exceeding great and bitter cry" signifies its great alteration in respect to the inversion of the state; "and said 
unto his father, Bless me, me also, O my father" signifies that it longed for conjunction, even although by what had gone before truth had been conjoined; "and he said, Thy brother came with fraud" 
signifies what is inverted of order; "and hath taken away thy blessing" signifies conjunction in that manner. [3] "And he said, Is it not that his name is called Jacob" signifies its quality; "and he 
hath supplanted me these two times" signifies that it had inverted order; "he hath taken away my birthright" signifies the loss of the priority; "and behold now he hath taken away my blessing" signifies 
the loss of the conjunction; "and he said, Hast thou not reserved a blessing for me" signifies whether there was for it anything in respect to conjunction in that former state. [4] "And Isaac answered 
and said unto Esau" signifies instruction; "behold I have made him thy master" signifies that in that state it should have the dominion; "and all his brethren have I given to him for servants" 
signifies that to the affection of truth at that time there had apparently been subordinated the affections of good; "and with corn and new wine have I sustained him" signifies, as before, its good and 
truth; and "what then shall I do for thee, my son" signifies that in that state there is nothing else for good. [5] "And Esau said unto his father" signifies the observation of natural good; "hast 
thou but this one blessing, my father" signifies whether in that case anything else could be adjoined from natural good; "bless me, me also, O my father" signifies that it longed for conjunction even 
although thereby truth had been conjoined; and "Esau lifted up his voice and wept" signifies a further state of alteration. [6] "And Isaac his father answered and said unto him" signifies perception 
concerning natural good, that it would be made Divine; "behold, of the fat things of the earth shall be thy dwelling" signifies that life is from the Divine good; "and of the dew of heaven from above" 
signifies that it is from the Divine truth. [7] "And upon thy sword shalt thou live, and thou shalt serve thy brother" signifies that so long as truth is being conjoined with good, good will in appearance 
be in a lower place; "and it shall come to pass when thou shalt have the dominion" signifies that it shall be in the prior place; "that thou shalt break his yoke from upon thy neck" signifies that 
the conjunction would then be through good, and that truth would be of good. </p>

Verses 34-40 Even as Esau heard his father's words, he cried out with a great and exceedingly bitter cry, and said to his father, Bless me, me also, my father. And he said, Your brother came in deceitfully, 
and has taken away your blessing. And he said, Does he not call his name Jacob? And he has supplanted me these two times. He took away my birthright, and behold, now he has taken away my blessing. 
And he said, Have you not reserved a blessing for me? And Isaac answered, and said to Esau, Behold, I have made him lord over you, and have given all his brothers to him as servants, and I have sustained 
him with grain and new wine. And for you therefore, what shall I do, my son? And Esau said to his father, Have you but one blessing, my father? Bless me, me also, my father. And Esau raised his 
voice, and wept. And Isaac his father answered, and said to him, Behold, of the fatness of the land will be your dwelling-place, and of the dew of heaven from above. And by your sword you will live, 
and you will serve your brother; and it will be when you have dominion over him, that you will break his yoke from above your neck. </p>
<p>'Esau heard his father's words' means the discernment of natural 
good from Divine good. 'And he cried out with a great and exceedingly bitter cry' means the great change that accompanied the inversion of state. 'And said to his father, Bless me, me also, my father' 
means that natural good desired to be joined to Divine good, even though through it truth was already joined. 'And he said, Your brother came in deceitfully' means the reversal of order. 'And has taken 
away your blessing' means the conjunction thus effected. 'And he said, Does he not call his name Jacob?' means the nature of natural truth. 'And he has supplanted me these two times' means that order 
was reversed by this 'He took away my birthright' means the prior position that it occupied. 'And behold, now he has taken away my blessing' means conjunction 'And he said, Have you not reserved 
a blessing for me?' means, Was not natural good joined in any way at all in that previous state? 'And Isaac answered, and said to Esau' means an informing. 'Behold, I have made him lord over you' means 
that in that state natural truth would have dominion over natural good. 'And have given all his brothers to him as servants' means that in this case affections for good were to outward appearances subordinate 
to the affection for truth 'And I have sustained him with grain and new wine' means, as previously, its good and truth 'And for you therefore, what shall I do, my son?' means that in that state 
good has nothing else 'And Esau said to his father' means the discernment of natural good. 'Have you but one blessing, my father?' means, Was it not possible in that case for anything from natural 
good to be linked to it? 'Bless me, me also, my father' means that it desired to be joined even though through it truth was already joined. 'And Esau raised his voice, and wept' means a further state 
in the change that took place. 'And Isaac his father answered, and said to him' means a perception that natural good would be made Divine. 'Behold, of the fatness of the land will be your dwelling-place' 
means life received from Divine Good. 'And of the dew of heaven from above' means from Divine Truth. 'And by your sword you will live, and you will serve your brother' means that all the time truth 
was joined to good, that good would to outward appearance occupy the lower position. 'And it will be when you have dominion over him' means that it will come to occupy the prior position. 'That you 
will break his yoke from above your neck' means that good would now be the means through which any joining together was effected - and that truth would be the truth of good. </p>

Vers. 34-40. Ut audivit Esau verba patris sui, et exclamavit exclamatione magna et amara usque valde; et dixit patri suo, Benedic mihi etiam ego pater mi.  Et dixit, Venit frater tuus in fraude, et sumpsit 
benedictionem tuam.  Et dixit, Num quod vocat nomen illius Jacob? et supplantavit me is duabus vicibus; primogenituram meam sumpsit, et ecce nunc sumpsit benedictionem meam; et dixit, Annon reservasti 
mihi benedictionem?  Ei respondit Jishak, et dixit Esavo, Ecce herum posui illum tibi, et omnes fratres ejus dedi ei in servos, et frumento et musto fulcivi eum, et tibi igitur quid faciam fili 
mi? Et dixit Esau ad patrem suum, An benedictio una haec tibi, pater mi? benedic mihi etiam ego pater mi; et sustulit Esau vocem suam, et flevit.  Et respondit Jishak pater ejus, et dixit ad eum, Ecce 
de pinguedinibus terrae erit habitatio tua, et de rore caeli desuper.  Et super gladio tuo vives, et fratri tuo servies, et erit quando dominaris, et disrumpes jugum illius desuper collo tuo. `Audivit 
Esau verba patris sui' significat apperceptionem boni naturalis ex Bono Divino: `et exclamavit exclamatione magna et amara usque valde' significat alterationem ejus magnam circa status inversionem: 
`et dixit patri suo, Benedic mihi etiam ego pater mi' significat quod desideraret conjunctionem, tametsi per illud conjunctum esset verum: `et dixit, Venit frater tuus in fraude' significat inversum 
ordinis: `et sumpsit benedictionem tuam' significat conjunctionem ita: `et dixit, Num quod vocat nomen illius Jacob?' significat quale ejus: `et supplantavit me is duabus vicibus' significat quod invertit 
ordinem:  `primogenituram meam sumpsit' significat prioritatem: `et ecce nunc sumpsit benedictionem meam' significat conjunctionem:  `et dixit, Annon reservasti mihi benedictionem?' significat an 
aliquid ei esset quoad conjunctionem in priore illo statu: `et respondit Jishak, et dixit Esavo' significat instructionem: `Ecce herum posui illum tibi' significat quod in illo statu dominaretur `et 
omnes fratres ejus dedi ei in servos' significat quod affectioni veri tunc subordinatae sint affectiones boni quoad apparentiam: `et frumento et musto fulcivi eum' significat, ut prius, ejus bonum et 
verum: `et tibi igitur quid faciam, fili mi?' significat quod bono in illo statu non aliud sit: `et dixit Esau ad patrem suum' significat apperceptionem boni naturalis: `An benedictio una haec tibi, 
pater mi?' significat num aliud adjungi posset ex bono naturali tunc: `benedic mihi etiam ego pater mi' significat quod desideraret conjunctionem tametsi per illud conjunctum esset verum: `et sustulit 
Esau vocem et flevit' significat statum ulteriorem alterationis: `et respondit Jishak pater ejus, et dixit ad eum' significat perceptionem de bono naturali quod Divinum fieret: `Ecce de pinguedinibus 
terrae habitatio tua' significat quo ex Divino Bono vita: `et de rore caeli desuper' significat quod ex Divino Vero: `et super gladio tuo vives, et fratri tuo servies' significat quamdiu conjungitur 
verum bono, esset inferiore loco ad apparentiam: `et erit quando dominaris' significat quod priore loco erit: `et disrumpes jugum illius desuper collo tuo' significat quod per bonum tunc conjunctio, et 
quod verum esset ejus. </p>
