<h3 align="center" class="ired">属天的奥秘 第9336节</h3>
<h4 align="center"></h4><p><strong>9336.</strong>“我要渐渐地将他们从你面前撵出去”表按次序逐渐所实现的一种移走。这从“渐渐地”和“撵出去”的含义清楚可知：“渐渐地”是指逐渐，因而是指缓慢地；“撵出去”当论及迦南地的各个民族所表示的虚假和邪恶时，是指移走，如刚才所述（<a href="9333.htm">9333</a>节）。之所以说“按次序逐渐”，是因为对一个正在重生的人而言，一切事物都照着天堂的秩序而重新安排。因为已经重生的人就是一个微型天堂（<a href="9276.htm">9276</a>节）；因此，在这个人里面也存在类似天堂中的一个秩序。<br />当一个人出生时，就其遗传的邪恶而言，他就是一个微型地狱。他也照着将遗传之恶归给自己，并将自己的也添加于其中的程度而变成一个地狱。正因如此，人的生命秩序由于与生俱来的东西和他的实际生活而与天堂的秩序对立。因为一个人自己的东西会使他爱自己胜过主，爱世界胜过天堂；而天堂的生命则在于爱主胜过一切，并爱邻如己。由此明显可知，前一种生命，即地狱的生命，必须彻底被摧毁，也就是说，邪恶和虚假必须被移走，好叫新的生命，即天堂的生命可以被植入（参看<a href="4551.htm">4551</a>，<a href="4552.htm">4552</a>，<a href="4839.htm">4839</a>，<a href="6068.htm">6068</a>节）。这一切绝无可能在仓促之间完成，因为深深扎根下来的一切邪恶及其虚假与其它一切邪恶及其虚假都相互联系在一起。这些邪恶和虚假数不胜数，它们之间的联系如此复杂，以至于连天使都无法理解，只有主明白。由此明显可知，与一个人同在的地狱生命不可能突然被毁；因为如果它真的突然被毁，这个人也会马上灭亡。天堂的生命也不可能突然被植入，因为如果它真的突然被植入，这个人照样会灭亡。<br />主将一个人从地狱的生命引入天堂的生命所经由的隐秘道路有成千上万条，而人类几乎连一条也不知道。我从天堂得知，事实就是如此，我所意识到的许多事也向我证实了这一点。由于人类对这些事几乎一无所知，所以许多人在涉及人摆脱邪恶和虚假，也就是罪得赦免的事上犯了错误。他们以为与一个人同在的地狱生命，能在一瞬间靠怜悯转变为与他同在的天堂生命。而事实上，怜悯在于整个重生行为；除了那些在世上以信和爱接受主的怜悯之人外，没有人经历重生，正如主在约翰福音中所说的：<br />凡接待祂的，就是信祂名的人，祂就赐他们权柄，作神的儿女。他们不是从血生的，不是从肉欲生的，也不是从人意生的，乃是从神生的。（约翰福音<a href="http://39-27.cn/约1.12.htm">1:12</a>，<a href="http://39-27.cn/约1.13.htm">13</a>）<br />至于“血”、“肉欲”、“人意”，以及“从神生的”表示什么，可参看前文（<a href="5826.htm">5826</a>节）。<br />还必须简要说明如何正确理解“按次序逐渐所实现的邪恶和虚假的移走”。从主的神性良善发出的神性真理将天堂里的一切都安排得井然有序；因此，这含有来自主的良善在里面的神性真理就是秩序本身 （<a href="1728.htm">1728</a>，<a href="1919.htm">1919</a>，<a href="2258.htm">2258</a>，<a href="2447.htm">2447</a>，<a href="5703.htm">5703</a>，<a href="6338.htm">6338</a>，<a href="8700.htm">8700</a>，<a href="8988.htm">8988</a>节）。那里的一切都按这个秩序存在，也都按这个秩序而持续存在；因为持续存在就是不断存在。因此，为叫天堂能在一个人里面存在，他有必要以他从主所拥有的良善来接受神性真理。这一切只能照着类似于主依次安排天堂所遵循的那种秩序而逐渐实现；因为如果事情的性质是一样的，那么无论大小，其情形也是一样的。这种循序渐进的安排就是此处“逐渐实现的次序”的意思。由此也明显可知，一个人的新造，也就是重生，类似于天地的创造。因此，在圣言中，“一个新天和一个新地”表示一个新教会（<a href="1733.htm">1733</a>，<a href="1850.htm">1850</a>，<a href="2117.htm">2117</a>，<a href="2118.htm">2118</a>e，<a href="3355.htm">3355</a>e，<a href="4535.htm">4535</a>节）；在创世记第一章，天地的创造也表示被称为人的属天教会的新造；对此，可参看对那一章的解释。</p>

By little and little I will drive him out from before thee. That this signifies a removal by degrees according to order, is evident from the signification of "by little and little," as being by degrees, 
thus slowly; from the signification of "driving out," when said of the falsities and evils which are signified by the nations of the land of Canaan, as being removal (of which just above, n. 9333). 
It is said "by degrees according to order," because with the man who is being regenerated all things are disposed according to the order of heaven; for the regenerate man is a heaven in the least form, 
and therefore there is in him an order like that which is in heaven. [2] When a man is born, in respect to hereditary evils he is a hell in the least form; and he also becomes a hell insofar as he 
takes the hereditary evils to himself, and adds to them things which are his own. Hence it is that both from birth and from actual life the order of his life is opposite to the order of heaven; for 
from his own a man loves himself more than the Lord, and the world more than heaven; when yet the life of heaven consists in loving the Lord above all things and the neighbor as oneself. From this it 
is evident that the former life, which is of hell, must be utterly destroyed (that is to say, the evils and falsities must be removed), in order that the new life, which is the life of heaven, may be 
implanted (see n. 4551, 4552, 4839, 6068). This cannot possibly be done hastily; for every evil that is rooted in with its falsities has a connection with all evils and their falsities; and such evils 
and falsities are innumerable, and their connection is so complex that it cannot be comprehended, not even by the angels, but only by the Lord. From this it is evident that the life of hell with a man 
cannot be destroyed suddenly; for if it were, he would straightway expire; and neither can the life of heaven be implanted suddenly, for if it were, he would also expire.  [3] There are thousands and 
thousands of arcana, of which scarcely a single one is known to man, whereby a man is led by the Lord out of the life of hell into the life of heaven. That this is so, has been given me to know from 
heaven, and it has likewise been confirmed by many things which have come to my notice. As man knows scarcely anything of these matters, many have fallen into errors about the liberation of man from 
evils and falsities (that is, the forgiveness of sins), believing that through mercy the life of hell in a man can be instantly turned into the life of heaven in him; when yet the whole act of regeneration 
is mercy, and none are regenerated except those who receive the mercy of the Lord in faith and life while in the world; according to the Lord's words in John: </p>
<p>     As many as received, to them 
gave He the power to be sons of God, even to them that believe in His name; who were born, not of bloods, nor of the will of the flesh, nor of the will of man, but of God (John 1:12, 13); </p>
<p>what is meant 
by "bloods," by "the will of the flesh," and "the will of man," also by being "born of God," may be seen above (n. 5826).  [4] What is properly meant by removal from evils and falsities by degrees 
according to order, shall also be briefly stated. The Divine truth which proceeds from the Divine good of the Lord disposes all things into order in heaven; and therefore this Divine truth, in which 
there is good from the Lord, is order itself (n. 1728, 1919, 2258, 2447, 5703, 6338, 8700, 8988). According to this order all things in heaven come forth, and according to the same order they subsist; 
for to subsist is perpetually to come forth. In order therefore that heaven may come forth in a man it is necessary that he receive Divine truth in the good proceeding from the Lord. This can only be 
done by degrees according to an order similar to that by which the Lord sets heaven in order; for the case with a thing of the same nature is the same in what is small as in what is great. This successive 
setting in order is what is here meant by "order according to degrees." From all this it is also evident that the case with the new creation of man-which is his regeneration-is the same as with 
the creation of heaven and earth. Wherefore also in the Word by "a new heaven and a new earth" is meant a new church (n. 1733, 1850, 2117, 2118, 3355, 4535); and also by the creation of heaven and earth 
in the first chapter of Genesis is meant the new creation of the celestial church, which is called "Man" (of which see in the explications there). </p>

<p align="center"><b>Elliott(1983-1999) 9336</b></p><p><b>9336.</b>
'Little by little I will drive them out from before you' means a removal effected gradually according to order. This is clear from the meaning of 'little by little' as gradually, thus slowly; and from 
the meaning of 'driving out' - when it has reference to falsities and evils, meant by the nations of the land of Canaan - as a removal, dealt with just above in <a href="9333.htm">9333</a>. The words 'gradually according 
to order' are used because everything with a person who is being regenerated is rearranged in accordance with heavenly order. For a person who has been regenerated is a miniature heaven, <a href="9276.htm">9276</a>, and therefore 
also within that person order exists akin to that which obtains in heaven.  </p>
<p></p>
<p><b>[2]</b>
 When a person is born he is, so far as his hereditary evils are concerned, a miniature hell. He also becomes an 
embodiment of hell to the extent that he draws on hereditary evils and adds his own to them. This being so, the order of a person's life which exists by reason of what he receives at birth, and by reason 
of his own acts in life, is the opposite of heavenly order. For what is a person's own leads him to love self more than the Lord and to love the world more than heaven, whereas the life of heaven 
consists in loving the Lord above all things and the neighbour as oneself. From this it is evident that the first life, which is that of hell, must be completely destroyed, that is, evils and falsities 
must be removed, in order that the new life, which is that of heaven, may be implanted, see <a href="4551.htm">4551</a>, <a href="4552.htm">4552</a>, <a href="4839.htm">4839</a>, <a href="6068.htm">6068</a>. This cannot possibly be done hurriedly, for every deep-rooted evil, together with 
its falsities, is interconnected with all other evils and their falsities. Such evils and falsities are countless, and their interconnection is so complex that it cannot be comprehended, not even by 
angels, only by the Lord. From this it is evident that the life of hell with a person cannot be destroyed suddenly; for if it were destroyed suddenly the person too would perish. Nor can the life of 
heaven be implanted suddenly, for if this were implanted suddenly the person would again perish.  </p>
<p></p>
<p><b>[3]</b>
 There are thousands and thousands of hidden ways, scarcely a single one of which is known to mankind, 
by which the Lord leads a person from the life of hell to the life of heaven. I have been informed from heaven that this is so, and it has also been corroborated for me by many things that I have 
been made aware of. Since mankind knows scarcely anything at all about these things many have fallen into errors concerning human deliverance from evils and falsities, which is the forgiveness of sins. 
They think that the life of hell with a person can be changed to the life of heaven with him in an instant, by mercy. But in actual fact mercy lies in the whole act of regeneration; and none undergo 
regeneration apart from those who receive the Lord's mercy in faith and life while they are in the world, in keeping with the Lord's words in John,  </p>
<blockquote>
As many as received Him, to them He gave power 
to be sons of God, to those believing in His name, who were born, not of blood<A name="fntext1"></a><A href="#fn1"><sup>a</sup></a>, nor of the will of the flesh, nor of the will of man (vir), but of God. <a href="http://bible.gospelcom.net/cgi-bin/bible?passage=John%201:12,%2013&amp;version=ESV&amp;interface=print&amp;showfn=yes&amp;showxref">John 1:12, 13</a>.  
</blockquote>
<p>What 'blood', 'the will of 
the flesh', and 'the will of man', also 'born of God' mean, see <a href="5826.htm">5826</a>.  </p>
<p></p>
<p><b>[4]</b>
 The proper way to understand 'a removal from evils and falsities, effected gradually according to order' must also be stated 
briefly. Divine Truth which emanates from the Lord's Divine Good arranges all things into order in heaven; consequently this Divine Truth, holding good from the Lord within it, is order itself, see <a href="1728.htm">1728</a>, <a href="1919.htm">1919</a>, <a href="2247.htm">2247</a>, <a href="2258.htm">2258</a>, <a href="5703.htm">5703</a>, <a href="6338.htm">6338</a>, <a href="8700.htm">8700</a>, <a href="8988.htm">8988</a>. In accordance with that order all things there come into being, and in accordance with that same order they remain in being; for remaining in being is 
a constant coming into being. Therefore to enable heaven to come into being in a person, it is necessary for him to receive Divine Truth in the good he has from the Lord. This can be brought into effect 
only gradually, according to the order similar to that which governs the way the Lord arranges heaven; for if the essential nature of the thing is the same, then the situation on the smaller scale 
is the same as on the larger scale. This arranging step-by-step is what should be understood here by order brought into effect gradually. From all this it is also evident that the new creation of a 
person, which is his regeneration, resembles the creation of heaven and earth. For this reason also in the Word a new heaven and a new earth is used to mean a new Church, <a href="1733.htm">1733</a>, <a href="1850.htm">1850</a>, <a href="2117.htm">2117</a>, <a href="2118.htm">2118</a> (end), 
<a href="3355.htm">3355</a> (end), <a href="4535.htm">4535</a>; and the creation of heaven and earth in the first chapter of Genesis serves to mean the new creation of a celestial Church, called Man, dealt with in the explanations of that chapter.

`Parum parum expellam illum ab ante te': quod significet remotionem per gradus secundum ordinem, constat ex significatione `parum parum' quod sit per gradus, ita lente, ex significatione `expellere' 
cum de falsis et malis, quae per gentes terrae Canaanis {1} significantur, quod sit {2} remotio, de qua mox supra n. 9333.  Per gradus secundum ordinem dicitur quia secundum ordinem caeli disponuntur 
omnia apud hominem qui regeneratur; homo enim regeneratus est caelum in minima forma, n. 9276; quare etiam in illo est similis ordo qui est in caelo. 	[2] Homo cum nascitur, quoad mala hereditaria est 
infernum in minima forma, et quoque fit infernum quantum ex malis hereditariis desumit, (c)ac illis superaddit propria; inde est quod ordo ejus vitae ex nativitate et ex actuali vita sit {3} oppositus 
ordini caeli; nam homo ex proprio amat se prae Domino et amat mundum prae caelo, cum tamen vita caeli est amare Dominum supra omnia, et proximum sicut semet; inde patet quod prior vita, quae est inferni, 
prorsus destruenda sit, hoc est, mala et falsa removenda ut vita nova, quae est vita caeli, implantetur, videatur n. 4551, 4552, 4839, 6068; hoc nequaquam fieri potest festine, nam unumquodvis 
malum cum suis falsis irradicatum nexum cum omnibus malis et eorum falsis habet; et talia mala (c)ac falsa (t)sunt innumerabilia, et nexus eorum est tam multiplex ut non comprehendi possit, ne quidem 
ab angelis, sed solum a Domino; inde patet quod vita inferni apud hominem non destrui queat subito, nam si subito, prorsus exspiraret, et quod vita caeli nec implantari queat subito, nam si subito, etiam 
exspiraret; [3] sunt milia et milia arcanorum, quorum vix unicum homini notum est, per quae ducitur homo a Domino, (d)cum a vita inferni in vitam caeli; quod ita sit, scire datum est e caelo, et 
quoque confirmatum est per plura quae ad apperceptionem venerunt; quia homo de his vix aliquid scit, ideo multi lapsi sunt in errores de liberatione hominis a malis et falsis, seu de remissione peccatorum, 
credendo quod vita inferni apud hominem momento transcribi possit in vitam caeli apud illum ex misericordia; cum tamen totus actus regenerationis est misericordia, et non alii regenerantur quam 
qui misericordiam Domini recipiunt fide et vita in mundo, secundum Domini verba apud Johannem, 	Quotquot receperunt, dedit illis potestatem ut filii Dei essent, credentibus in nomen Ipsius, qui non ex 
sanguinibus, neque ex voluntate carnis, neque ex voluntate viri, sed ex Deo nati sunt, i 12, 13; </p>
<p>quid `sanguines,' `voluntas carnis,' et `voluntas viri,' tum `ex Deo natus,' videatur n. 5826. 	[4] 
Quid proprie intelligitur per remotionem a malis et falsis per gradus secundum ordinem, etiam paucis dicetur: Divinum Verum quod procedit a Divino Bono Domini disponit omnia in ordinem in caelo, quapropter 
Divinum illud Verum in quo bonum a Domino {4}, est ipse ordo, videatur n. 1728, 1919, 2247, 2258, 5703, 6338, 8700, 8988; secundum eum ordinem existunt omnia ibi, et secundum eundem subsistunt, 
nam subsistere est perpetuo existere; ut itaque caelum in homine existat, necessarium est ut recipiat Divinum Verum in bono a Domino; hoc fieri non potest nisi per gradus secundum similem ordinem, secundum 
quem Dominus ordinat caelum, nam res quae ejusdem naturae est se similiter habet in parvo sicut in magno; successiva illa ordinatio est quae hic intelligitur per ordinem secundum gradus.  (m)Ex 
his quoque patet quod creatio nova hominis, quae est ejus regeneratio, se habeat sicut creatio caeli et terrae; quapropter etiam in Verbo per novum caelum et novam terram intelligitur nova Ecclesia, 
n. 1733, 1850, 2117, 2118 fin., 3355 fin., 4535, et quoque per creationem caeli et terrae in (t)primo capite Geneseos intelligitur nova creatio Ecclesiae caelestis, quae vocatur homo {5}, (o)de qua re
