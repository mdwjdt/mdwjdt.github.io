<h3 align="center" class="ired">属天的奥秘 第6564节</h3>
<h4 align="center"></h4><p><strong>6564.</strong>“因为从前他们恶待你”表他们曾远离所流入的良善与真理。这从“恶”的含义清楚可知，“恶”是指远离（参看<a href="5746.htm">5746</a>节）。“他们恶待你”表示所远离的，是所流入的良善与真理；因为“约瑟”是内在，或内在良善（参看<a href="5805.htm">5805</a>，<a href="5826.htm">5826</a>，<a href="5827.htm">5827</a>，<a href="5869.htm">5869</a>，<a href="5877.htm">5877</a>节），良善与真理通过这内在或内在良善从主流入。至于经由内在的流注，情况是这样：主不断经由人的内在以良善和真理流入；良善带来生命及其热，热就是爱；而真理则带来启示及其光，光就是信。但对恶人来说，当这流注继续流入，进入人的外层时，它或遭到抵制和弃绝，或被扭曲，或被窒息、扼杀。通向内层的路照着这种弃绝、扭曲或窒息、扼杀而被关闭，只有入口如同透过周围的缝隙般零星敞开。此人由此仍保有思考和意愿的能力，不过只用来反对真理和良善。这种关闭照着邪恶的生活和随之对虚假的确信而越来越渗透到外层，一直渗透到感官层；到那时，他便在感官层进行思考。当这种情况发生时，感官的快感和欲望就会把一切东西都带走，或说除去其它的一切。地狱里的人就处于这种状态，因为进入来世的恶人由于谋取利益、职位和名声的缘故而被剥夺了明白何为诚实、善良的能力；那时，感官就是他们发挥功能所在的那个层面。</p>

Because they requited evil to thee. That this signifies because they had turned away from the good and truth which flow in, is evident from the signification of "evil," as being a turning away (see n. 
5746). That it denotes from the good and truth which flow in, is signified by "they requited to thee," for "Joseph" is the celestial, and internal good (see n. 5805, 5826, 5827, 5869, 5877), through 
which good and truth flow in from the Lord. As regards the influx through the internal, the case is this. The Lord continually flows in through man's internal with good and truth, good giving life and 
its heat, which is love, and truth giving enlightenment and its light, which is faith. But when this influx advances further, namely, into the exteriors, with the evil it is resisted and rejected, or 
is perverted or stifled; and then according to the rejection, perversion, or stifling, the interiors are closed, an entrance only remaining open here and there as through chinks round about; and from 
this there remains to the man the capacity to think and will, but against truth and good. This closing penetrates toward the exteriors more and more, according to the life of evil, and the consequent 
persuasion of falsity, and this down to the sensuous degree, from which then comes the thought. Pleasures and cravings then carry everything off. In such a state are those who are in the hells; for 
all considerations of what is honorable and good for the sake of gain, honor, and reputation, are taken away from the evil who come into the other life, and then they are in what is sensuous. </p>

'For the evil with which they repaid you' means that they had become turned away from inflowing goodness and truth. This is clear from the meaning of 'the evil' as a turning away, dealt with in <a href="5746.htm">5746</a>. 
The fact that inflowing goodness and truth were what was turned away is meant by 'they repaid you'; for 'Joseph' is the celestial, or internal good, <a href="5805.htm">5805</a>, <a href="5826.htm">5826</a>, <a href="5817.htm">5817</a>, <a href="5869.htm">5869</a>, <a href="5877.htm">5877</a>, the channel through 
which goodness and truth flow in from the Lord. What influx by way of the internal entails is this: The Lord flows in constantly with goodness and truth through a person's internal. The goodness brings 
life and the heat to sustain it, which is the heat of love, while the truth brings a state of enlightenment and the light that maintains it, which is the light of faith. But with the evil, when that 
influx passes on into a person's exteriors, it is resisted and rejected, or perverted, or smothered. And to the extent that it is rejected, perverted, or smothered, the way to his interiors is blocked; 
only here and there does access to them lie open, as if through chinks round about. The ability to think and will therefore remains with the person, though only in opposition to what is true and good. 
That blockage to his interiors spreads further and further into his exteriors, the more wickedly he lives and the more convinced of falsity he consequently becomes. It spreads right down to the level 
of the senses, which then becomes the level on which he thinks. When this happens the desires and appetites of the senses remove all else. This is what the state of those in hell is like; for the 
evil who enter the next life are deprived of any ability to see what is honest and good for the sake of earning monetary gains, important positions, and reputation; then the senses are the level on which 
they function. </p>

`Quia malum retribuerunt tibi': quod significet quod aversi fuerint a bono et vero quae influunt, constat a significatione `mali' quod sit aversio, de qua n. 5746; quod sit a bono et vero quae influunt, 
significatur per `retribuerunt tibi', nam `Josephus' est caeleste ac bonum internum, n. 5805, 5826, 5827, 5869, 5877, per quod bonum et verum influunt a Domino.  Cum influxu per internum ita se habet: 
Dominus continue influit per internum hominis cum bono et vero; bonum dat vitam et ejus calorem qui est amor, verum autem dat illustrationem et ejus lucem quae est fides, sed influxus ille apud 
malos cum pergit ulterius, nempe in exteriora {1}, resistitur et rejicitur, aut pervertitur {2}vel suffocatur {3}, et tunc secundum rejectionem, perversionem aut suffocationem, clauduntur interiora, patente 
solum introitu hic et ibi sicut per rimas circumcirca; inde homini remanet facultas cogitandi et volendi, sed contra verum et bonum; illa occlusio penetrat versus exteriora magis et magis secundum 
vitam mali et inde persuasionem falsi, et hoc usque ad sensuale, {4}ex quo dein cogitatio; voluptates et appetitiones tunc auferunt omne; in tali statu sunt illi qui in infernis; nam malis qui in 
alteram vitam veniunt, auferuntur intuitiones honesti et boni propter lucra, honores et famam; et tunc in sensuali sunt. @1 i hominis$ @2 et$ @3 i a falsis$ @4 A d ex i in$ </p>
