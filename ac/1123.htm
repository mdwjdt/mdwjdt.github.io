<h3 align="center" class="ired">属天的奥秘 第1123节</h3>
<h4 align="center"></h4><p><strong>1123.</strong>我曾与上古教会的第三代交谈过，他们说，在世时的那个年代，他们期待主降世拯救全人类，“女人的种要踹你的头”是他们的习惯说法。还说，那时，他们生活的最大快乐就在于繁衍后代，因而他们最大的愉悦就在于为了后代而热爱自己的配偶。他们称这些愉悦是最令人快乐的，这些快乐也是最令人愉悦的，并补充说，对这些快乐和愉悦的直觉来自出于天堂的流注，因为主要降生。</p>

<p><strong>[NCE]1123.</strong> I talked to the third generation of the earliest church, and they said that in their day on earth they looked forward to the arrival of the Lord, who was to save the human race. It was common, they said, for them to speak of the fact that the woman's seed would trample the snake's head [<a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_1123/bible_king-james-version_genesis_3_15" target=_top>Genesis 3:15</a>].<br />They went on to say that from that time on, the greatest exhilaration of their lives had been to have children, with the result that their highest pleasure was loving their spouse in order to produce offspring. They called this their most enjoyable delight and their most delightful joy. The perception of this thrill and pleasure, they added, came from the idea flowing out of heaven that the Lord would be born. </p>

I have conversed with the third generation of the Most Ancient Church, who said that in their time, when they lived in the world, they expected the Lord, who would save the whole human race; and that 
it was then a common saying among them that the seed of the woman would tread down the serpent's head. They said that from that time the greatest delight of their life was to procreate offspring; so 
that their sweetest deliciousnesses were to love their consort for the sake of offspring, which they called most delightful deliciousnesses and most delicious delights, adding that the perception of these 
delights and deliciousnesses was from influx out of heaven, because the Lord was to be born. </p>

I have spoken to the third generation of the Most Ancient Church who said that at the time they lived in the world they awaited the coming of the Lord to save the whole human race, and that 'the seed 
of the woman would trample on the head of the serpent' was a common saying among them in those times. They said that at that time their greatest delight in life was in producing offspring, and thus that 
their greatest pleasures lay in loving their married partner for the sake of offspring. They called those pleasures most delightful, and the delights most pleasurable, adding that the perception of 
these delights and pleasures came from an influx from heaven because the Lord was going to be born. </p>

</p><b>1123.</b>
Locutus cum tertia generatione Antiquissimae Ecclesiae qui dicebant quod suo tempore cum vixerunt in mundo, exspectaverint Dominum Qui salvaret universum genus humanum; et quod apud eos in communi tunc 
sermone fuerit, quod 'Semen mulieris proculcaret caput serpentis':  dicebant quod ab illo tempore jucundissimum illorum vitae fuerit procreare sobolem, sic ut eorum summae deliciae fuerint amare conjugem 
prolis gratia; vocabant illas delicias jucundissimas, et jucunditates deliciosissimas, addendo quod perceptio harum jucunditatum et deliciarum fuerit ex influxu e caelo quia nasceretur Dominus. </p>
