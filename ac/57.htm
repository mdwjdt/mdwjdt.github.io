<h4 align="center"></h4><p><strong>57.</strong>“结种子的草本”表正知正见，“结果子的树”表信之良善。“果子”是主赐给属天之人的食物，“结果子的核”是主赐给属灵之人的食物，故此处说“结有核的树将作为你们的食物”。下一章将论述属天之人，届时将说明属天的食物被称为树的“果子”，此处仅以主藉以西结所说的话为证：“在河这边与那边的岸上必生长各类的树木，其果可作食物，叶子不枯干，果子不断绝，每月必结新果子，因为这水是从圣所流出来的。树上的果子必作食物，叶子乃为治病。”（以西结书<a href="http://39-27.cn/结47.12.htm">47:12</a>）<br />“水从圣所流出来”象征主的生命和慈悲，主是那“圣所”；“果子”象征智慧，作为属天之人的食物；“叶子”象征聪明，为他们所用，该用途被称为“治病”。<br />至于属灵的食物被称为“草本”，可见于诗篇：“耶和华是我的牧者，我必不至缺乏。他使我躺卧在青草地上。”（诗篇<a href="http://39-27.cn/诗23.1.htm">23:1</a>-<a href="http://39-27.cn/诗23.2.htm">2</a>）</p>

<p><strong>[NCE]57.</strong> The seed-bearing plant is every true idea that looks toward a useful goal. The tree that has fruit is religious good; the fruit is what the Lord gives the heavenly person, but the seed leading to new fruit is what he gives the spiritual person, which is why it says the tree that produces seed will serve you for food.<br />The next chapter, treating of the heavenly type of person, will demonstrate that heavenly food is called the fruit from a tree.{*1} Here the Lord's words through Ezekiel will suffice:<br />Beside the river, on its bank, on this side and that, grows every food tree. Its leaf will not fall, and its fruit will not be used up. Month by month it is reborn, because its waters are going out from the sanctuary. And its fruit will serve as food, and its leaf, as medicine. (<a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_57/bible_king-james-version_ezekiel_47_12" target=_top>Ezekiel 47:12</a>)<br />"Water from the sanctuary" symbolizes the living energy and mercy of the Lord, who is the "sanctuary." The fruit symbolizes wisdom, which is food to people of heavenly character. The leaf is intelligence, which is given to them for a purpose referred to as "medicine."<br />The idea that spiritual food is called a plant (or grass), though, is expressed in David:<br />My shepherd, I will lack nothing. In grassy pastures you make me lie down.

The "herb bearing seed" is every truth which regards use; the "tree in which is fruit" is the good of faith; "fruit" is what the Lord gives to the celestial man, but "seed producing fruit" is what He 
gives to the spiritual man; and therefore it is said, the "tree yielding seed, to you it shall be for food." That celestial food is called fruit from a tree, is evident from the following chapter, where 
the celestial man is treated of. In confirmation of this we will here cite only these words of the Lord from Ezekiel: </p>
<p>     By the river, upon the bank thereof, on this side and on that side, there 
cometh up every tree of food, whose leaf shall not fade, neither shall the fruit thereof be consumed; it is born again in its month; because these its waters issue out of the sanctuary; and the fruit 
thereof shall be for food, and the leaf thereof for medicine (Ezek. 47:12). "Waters issuing out of the sanctuary" signify the life and mercy of the Lord, who is the "sanctuary." "Fruit" is wisdom, 
which shall be food for them; the "leaf" is intelligence which shall be for their use, and this use is called "medicine." But that spiritual food is called "herb" appears from David:     My shepherd, 
I shall not want; Thou makest me to lie down in pastures of herb (Ps. 23:1-2). </p>

'The plant yielding seed' is every truth that looks towards a use. 'The tree in which there is fruit' is the good that accompanies faith. 'Fruit' is what the Lord gives to the celestial man, while 'seed', 
the source of the fruit, is what He gives to the spiritual man. This is why it is said that 'the tree producing seed will be for you for food'. That celestial food is called 'fruit from a tree' 
is clear from the next chapter where the subject is the celestial man. Here let just that be mentioned which the Lord spoke through Ezekiel,  </p>
<blockquote>
Beside the river there is rising up upon its bank, on this 
side and on that, every tree for food. Its leaf will not fall nor its fruit fail. It is re-born monthly, for its waters flow out from the Sanctuary, and its fruit will be for food, and its leaf for 
medicine. <a href="http://bible.gospelcom.net/cgi-bin/bible?passage=Ezek%2047:12&amp;version=ESV&amp;interface=print&amp;showfn=yes&amp;showxref">Ezek 47:12</a>.   
</blockquote>
'Waters from the Sanctuary' means the life and mercy of the Lord, who is the Sanctuary; 'fruit' means wisdom, which is food for them; 'leaf' is intelligence, which is given 
them for a use, which is called 'medicine'. Spiritual food however is called 'a plant', as stated through David,  [Jehovah is] my Shepherd, I shall not want; He makes me<A name="fntext1"></a><A href="#fn1"><sup>a</sup></a> lie down in green pastures.<A name="fntext2"></a><A href="#fn2"><sup>b</sup></a>

'Herba seminificans semen' est omne verum quod spectat usum; 'arbor in qua fructus' est bonum fidei: 'fructus' est quod Dominus dat homini caelesti, sed 'semen' ex quo fructus, quod homini spirituali; 
quare dicitur 'arbor producens semen vobis erit in cibum.' Quod cibus caelestis dicatur 'fructus ex arbore,' constat ex capite sequente ubi agitur de caelesti homine; solum hic quod Dominus locutus 
per Ezechielem, Juxta fluvium ascendit super ripam ejus hinc et illinc, omnis arbor cibi, non decidet folium ejus, et non consumetur fructus ejus; in menses ejus renascitur, quia aquae ejus e sanctuario 
illae exeuntes, et erit fructus ejus in cibum, et folium ejus in medicinam, xlvii 12. 'Aquae e sanctuario' significant vitam et misericordiam Domini, Qui est Sanctuarium; 'fructus' sapientiam, quae 
illis cibus; 'folium' est intelligentia, quae illis propter usum, qui vocatur 'medicina.' Quod autem cibus spiritualis dicatur 'herba,' dicitur per Davidem, Pastor meus, non carebo, in pascuis herbae 
cubare {1} facis me, Ps. xxiii 1, 2. @  1 In n. 3696 and all other places S. has faciet, and i. Jehovah before Pastor.$ </p>
