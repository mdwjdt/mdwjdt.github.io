<h3 align="center" class="ired">属天的奥秘 第3001节</h3>
<h4 align="center"></h4><p><strong>3001.</strong>只有一种生命，那就是主的生命，它流入人内，带给其生命，无论他是善还是恶。这从前面解读圣言时的阐述和说明（<a href="1954.htm">1954</a>，<a href="2021.htm">2021</a>，<a href="2536.htm">2536</a>，<a href="2658.htm">2658</a>，<a href="2706.htm">2706</a>，<a href="2886.htm">2886</a>-<a href="2889.htm">2889</a>节）明显看出来。与那生命相对应的接受物凭神性流注而被赋予生命。事实上，它们以看似凭自己活着的方式被复活。该对应就是生命与生命接受者之间的一种对应。接受者如何，其生命就如何。那些有爱与仁在里面的人便具有这种对应，因为他们适合并为自己大量接受这生命。而那些有爱与仁的反面在里面的人就没有这种对应，因为他们没有大量接受生命本身。因此，这些人只有生命的表象，并且其性质和他们本人的性质是一样的。<br />这一点可通过多种方式来说明。如，生命经由灵魂流入人体的运动和感觉器官。而这些器官的性质就决定了其动作和感觉的性质。这一点同样可通过阳光所照射的物体来说明，这光照着接受形式的性质而产生色彩。但在灵界，由生命的流注所产生的一切变化都是属灵的，聪明智慧的这类不同即源于此。</p>

That there is one only life, that of the Lord, which flows in and causes man to live, whether he be good or evil, is evident from what has been said and shown above, in the explication of the Word (n. 
1954, 2021, 2536, 2658, 2706, 2886-2889). To that life correspond the recipient things which are vivified by that Divine influx, and this in such a manner that they appear to themselves to live from 
themselves. This correspondence is that of life with the recipients of life. Such as are the recipients, so they live; those men who are in love and charity are in correspondence, for they are in agreement, 
and the life is received by them adequately; but those who are in things contrary to love and charity are not in correspondence, because the life itself is not received adequately; hence they 
have an appearance of life in accordance with their quality.  This may be illustrated by many things; as by the organs of motion and of sense in the body, into which the life flows through the soul; 
according to the qualities of these, such are their actions and sensations. The same may be illustrated also by the objects into which light flows from the sun; the light producing colorings according 
to the quality of the recipient forms. But in the spiritual world all the modifications that come into existence from the influx of life are spiritual, whence come such differences of intelligence and wisdom. </p>

There is but one and no more life - the Lord's. This life flows in and brings life to man, to both good and evil alike. This becomes clear from what has been stated and shown in the explanation of the 
Word, in <a href="1954.htm">1954</a>, <a href="2021.htm">2021</a>, <a href="2536.htm">2536</a>, <a href="2658.htm">2658</a>, <a href="2706.htm">2706</a>, <a href="2886.htm">2886</a>-<a href="2889.htm">2889</a>. To that life recipient objects correspond which are given life by means of that Divine influx, and indeed in such a way that these recipients seem to 
themselves to live of themselves. This correspondence is a correspondence of life with the recipients of life. Recipient objects have life insofar as they are recipients. Such correspondence exists 
with those who have love and charity within them, for they are fitted to receive and do receive that life as is adequate for them. But that correspondence does not exist with those who have the reverse 
of love and charity within them, for life itself is not received adequately by them. These therefore have but an appearance of life, the nature of which is the same as they are in themselves. This may 
be exemplified in a number of ways, for example, from the motor and the sensory organs of the body into which life Bows by way of the soul. The nature of those organs determines that of the actions 
and sensations in them. The same may also be exemplified by objects on to which light from the sun falls- the nature of the forms receiving it determines the colours seen in them. But in the spiritual 
world all the variations which result from the influx of life are spiritual, and this is the origin of such differences in intelligence and wisdom. </p>

Quod non sit nisi unica vita, quae est Domini, quae influit et facit ut vivat homo, immo ut vivant tam boni quam mali, constare potest ab illis quae in explicatione Verbi n. 1954, 2021, 2536, 2658, 
2706, 2886-2889 dicta et ostensa sunt; illi vitae correspondent recipientia quae per influxum illum Divinum vivificantur, et quidem ita ut appareant sibi vivere ex se; haec correspondentia est vitae cum 
recipientibus vitae; recipientia, sicut sunt, ita vivunt; illi homines qui in amore et charitate sunt, in correspondentia sunt, nam conveniunt, et recipitur ab illis vita adaequate; illi vero qui in 
contrariis amori et charitati sunt, non in correspondentia sunt, quia ipsa vita non recipitur adaequate; inde talis apparentia vitae illis est quales sunt.  Hoc illustrari potest a multis, sicut ab 
organis motoriis et sensoriis corporis in quae per animam vita influit; qualia illa sunt, tales sunt illorum actiones et sensationes: sicut etiam ex objectis in quae influit lux a sole, illa quales formae 
recipientes sunt, tales ibi colorificationes: at in mundo spirituali sunt omnes modificationes quae existunt ab influxu vitae, spirituales, inde tales differentiae intelligentiae et sapientiae. </p>
