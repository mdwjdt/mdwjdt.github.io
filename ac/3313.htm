<h3 align="center" class="ired">属天的奥秘 第3313节</h3>
<h4 align="center"></h4><p><strong>3313.</strong>“以撒爱以扫，因为他的野味在他口中”表神圣理性的神性良善热爱真理的良善。这从“以撒”和“以扫”的代表，以及下文有关以东的论述和“野味”（hunting）的含义清楚可知：“以撒”是指主神圣理性的神性良善（参看<a href="3012.htm">3012</a>，<a href="3013.htm">3013</a>，<a href="3194.htm">3194</a>，<a href="3210.htm">3210</a>节）；“以扫”是指主的神圣属世人里面的良善（对此，参看<a href="3300.htm">3300</a>，<a href="3302.htm">3302</a>节）；“野味”是指由属世真理所产生的生活的良善（参看<a href="3309.htm">3309</a>节）。“在他口中”表在祂的属世情感里面，因为在圣言中，“在心里”论及内层并从良善发出之物，而“在口中”论及外层并从真理发出之物。此处由以扫来代表、“野味”来表示的真理之良善是外层良善，即在属世情感中，并从真理发出，故经上说它“在以撒口中”。</p>

And Isaac loved Esau, because his hunting was in his mouth. That this signifies that the Divine good of the Divine rational loved the good of truth, is evident from the representation of Isaac, as being 
the Lord's Divine rational as to* Divine good (see n. 3012, 3013, 3194, 3210); and from the representation of Esau, as being the Lord's Divine natural as to the good therein (concerning which see 
also n. 3300, 3302); and from what follows concerning Edom; and from the signification of "hunting" as being the good of life from natural truths (see n. 3309). "In his mouth" signifies that it was in 
His natural affection; for in the Word that is said to be "in the heart" which is interior and proceeds from good, and that to be "in the mouth" which is exterior and proceeds from truth; and as the 
good of truth, which is here represented by Esau and is signified by "hunting," is exterior good-that is, is in natural affection, and proceeds from truth-therefore it is said to have been "in Isaac's 
mouth." * "Perfect" is here used in its quite familiar sense of "whole," "entire." The Latin is integer, and the Hebrew is tam, the same words that occur in the well-known passage, "Mark the perfect 
man" (Ps. 37:37). [REVISER.] </p>

'And Isaac loved Esau because of the venison he had in his mouth' means that the Divine Good of the Divine Rational loved the good of truth. This is clear from the representation of 'Isaac' as the Lord's 
Divine Rational as regards Divine Good, dealt with in <a href="3012.htm">3012</a>, <a href="3013.htm">3013</a>, <a href="3194.htm">3194</a>, <a href="3210.htm">3210</a>, from the representation of 'Esau' as the Lord's Divine Natural as regards the good there, dealt with in <a href="3300.htm">3300</a>, <a href="3302.htm">3302</a>, and 
later on where Edom is referred to; and from the meaning of 'venison' as the good of life arising out of natural truths, dealt with in <a href="3309.htm">3309</a>. 'In his mouth' means within his natural affection, for in 
the Word that which is interior and stems from good is referred to as being 'in the heart', and that which is exterior and stems from truth as being 'in the mouth'. And since the good of truth, which 
is here represented by Esau and is meant by 'hunting', is exterior, that is to say, within natural affection and stemming from truth, it is spoken of as being 'in Isaac's mouth'. </p>

`Et amabat Jishak Esavum, quia venatio in ore ejus': quod significet quod Divinum Bonum Divini Rationalis amaret bonum veri, constat ex repraesentatione `Jishaki' quod sit Divinum Rationale Domini quoad 
Divinum Bonum, de qua n. 3012, 3013, 3194, 3210; ex repraesentatione `Esavi' quod sit Divinum Naturale Domini quoad bonum ibi, de qua n. 3300, 3302, et in sequentibus ubi de Edomo; et ex significatione 
`venationis' quod sit bonum vitae ex veris naturalibus, de qua n. 3309; `in ore ejus' significat quod in affectione {1}naturali ejus esset; {2}nam in Verbo dicitur id esse in corde quod interius 
est et procedit ex bono, et id esse in ore quod exterius est et procedit ex vero; et quia bonum veri, quod hic repraesentatur per `Esavum' et significatur per `venationem,' est exterius, {3}nempe in 
(t)affectione naturali, {4}procedens ex vero, dicitur `in ore Jishaki fuisse.' @1 naturalis and in fourth line below$  @2 nam in Verbo dicitur esse in corde quod interius est, et esse in ore, quod
