<h3 align="center" class="ired">属天的奥秘 第2739节</h3>
<h4 align="center"></h4><p><strong>2739.</strong>一切爱，如父母对子女的爱，兄弟间的爱，以及亲友之间的爱等等，皆根据亲密程度依次从天上善与真的婚姻降下来。天上的一切社群皆根据唯独源于善与真，即对主的爱与信的这些爱而形成。主将这些社群联结起来，以至于它们类似一个人，天堂也因此被称作大人（Grand Man）。无法形容的多样性全都源于来自主的善与真的结合，并从它衍生而来，该结合就是天上的婚姻。这就解释为何世上一切血缘关系和其它家庭关系都可追溯到诸婚姻，也解释了为何爱的不同种类以同样的方式照亲密程度源于它们。但由于如今婚姻之爱不存在了，于是血缘关系和其它家庭关系就被算作婚姻，然爱的血缘关系并不存在。在上古教会，爱的衍生物就具有这种性质，因此他们在天上住在一起，可以说分开了各个民族、宗族和家庭，它们全都承认主是他们唯一的父母。</p>

From the marriage of good and truth in the heavens descend all loves, which are such as the love of parents toward their children, the love of brothers for one another, and the love for relatives, and 
so on, according to their degrees in their order. According to these loves, which are solely from good and truth, that is, from love to the Lord and faith in Him, are formed all the heavenly societies; 
which are so joined together by the Lord as to represent one man, and therefore heaven is also called the Grand Man. There are unutterable varieties, all of which take their origin and are derived 
from the union of good and truth from the Lord, which union is the heavenly marriage. Hence it is that the origin of all consanguinities and relationships on earth is derived from marriages, and that 
loves were derived in like manner according to their degrees mutually among themselves; but as there is no conjugial love at this day, consanguinities and relationships are indeed reckoned from marriage, 
but there are no consanguinities and relationships of love. In the Most Ancient Church the derivations of love were of this nature, and therefore they dwell together in the heavens distinguished 
as it were into nations, families, and houses, all of which acknowledge the Lord as their only Parent. </p>

From the marriage of good and truth in heaven all loves are descended, which are such as the love of parents towards their children, the love of brothers for one another, love towards other relatives, 
and so on down in their order according to their degrees of affinity. According to these loves that have their origin solely in good and truth, that is, in love and faith to the Lord, all heavenly communities 
are formed. And these are joined together by the Lord in such a way that they resemble a human being, which also is why heaven is called the Grand Man. There are indescribable varieties, all 
of which have their origin in and are derived from the union of good and truth from the Lord, which union is the heavenly marriage. This explains why on earth the origin of all blood relationships and 
other family relationships is traced back to marriages, and why in a similar way different kinds of love used to be derived according to the degrees of affinity among them. But as conjugial love does 
not exist at the present day, blood relationships and other family relationships are indeed worked out from marriages, but no comparable relationships of love exist. In the Most Ancient Church derivations 
of love were of this nature, and therefore in heaven those people dwell together, distinguished so to speak into separate nations, families, and houses, all of which acknowledge the Lord as their 
one and only parent. </p>

</p><b>2739.</b>
Ex conjugio boni et veri in caelis descendunt omnes amores, qui se habent sicut amor parentum erga liberos, amor fratrum inter se, et amor erga affines, et sic porro secundum gradus in suo ordine: secundum 
amores illos qui unice sunt ex bono et vero, hoc est, ex amore et fide in Dominum, formantur omnes societates caelestes, quae a Domino ita conjunctae sunt ut unum hominem referant, quare etiam 
caelum vocatur Maximus Homo; sunt varietates ineffabiles, quae omnes originem ducunt et derivantur ab unione boni et veri ex Domino, quae unio est conjugium caeleste: inde est quod a conjugiis in terris 
ducatur origo omnium consanguinitatum et affinitatum, et derivarentur similiter amores secundum gradus mutuo inter se; sed quia non est amor conjugialis hodie, consanguinitates et affinitates quidem 
inde recensentur, sed non sunt consanguinitates et affinitates amoris: in Antiquissima Ecclesia {1} tales derivationes amoris etiam fuerunt, quare in caelis cohabitant distinctae quasi in gentes, familias 
et domos, quae omnes Dominum ut unicum suum parentem agnoscunt. 	@1 i quae caelestis.$ </p>
