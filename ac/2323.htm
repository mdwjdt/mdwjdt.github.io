<h3 align="center" class="ired">属天的奥秘 第2323节</h3>
<h4 align="center"></h4><p><strong>2323.</strong>“晚上”表造访的时间。这从“晚上”的含义清楚可知。在圣言中，教会的状态被比作一年四季和一日四时。一年四季是指夏、秋、冬、春，一日四时是指午、晚（evening）、夜（night）、晨。这二者之间存在相似的循环。被称为“晚上”的教会状态是指不再有任何仁爱，结果信开始没有时的状态，因而是指教会不复存在时的状态。这就是夜随之而来的“晚上”（参看<a href="22.htm">22</a>节）。但教会的另外一种状态（即当仁爱闪耀出来，结果信也闪耀出来，因而当一个新教会正在兴起之时）也被称为“晚上”，这个“晚上”是指黎明前的曙色朦胧（参看<a href="883.htm">883</a>节）。因此，“晚上”表示这两种状态，因为主规定，当一个教会不复存在时，一个新教会就会兴起。这两个进程同步进行，因为若没有一个教会存在于这个世界的某个地方，人类就无法持续存在，因为它与天堂没有联结，如前所示（<a href="468.htm">468</a>，<a href="637.htm">637</a>，<a href="931.htm">931</a>，<a href="2054.htm">2054</a>节）。<br />本章论述了教会的这两种状态，即由“罗得”所代表的一个新教会的兴起和旧教会的灭亡，也就是“所多玛和蛾摩拉”所表示的。这从概览可以看出来。这就是为何此处经上说那两个天使“晚上”到了所多玛，还透露了晚上所发生的事（1-3节），夜里所发生的事（4-14节），早晨或黎明升起时所发生的事（15-22节），以及太阳升起后所发生的事（23-26节）。<br />由于“晚上”表教会的这些状态，故它也表审判之前的造访。因为当审判，也就是有信者的救恩和不信者的定罪即将来临时，先进的是造访，或检查他们的品质，也就是说，查看有没有仁和信。这种造访发生在“晚上”，因此造访本身被称为“晚上”。如西番雅书：<br />沿海地带的居民、基利提族有祸了！耶和华的话攻击你们：迦南、非利士人之地啊，我必毁灭你，以致无人居住。犹大家剩下的人必在亚实基伦的家里牧放，晚上必躺卧在那里；因为耶和华他们的神必眷顾（即造访，visit）他们，使他们被掳的人归回。（西番雅书<a href="http://39-27.cn/番2.5.htm">2:5</a>，<a href="http://39-27.cn/番2.7.htm">7</a>）</p>

That "evening" signifies the time of visitation, is evident from the signification of "evening." The states of the church are compared in the Word both to the seasons of the year and the times of the 
day; to the seasons of the year because to its summer, autumn, winter, and spring; to the times of the day because to its noon, evening, night, and morning; for the two things are similarly circumstanced. 
The state of the church which is called "evening," is when there is no longer any charity, consequently when there begins to be no faith, thus when the church is ceasing to be; this is the "evening" 
that is followed by the "night" (see n. 22). There is also an "evening" when charity shines forth, consequently when faith does so, and thus when a new church is rising up; this "evening" is the 
twilight before the morning (see n. 883). Thus "evening" has both significations, for it is provided by the Lord that when a church is ceasing to be, a new one is rising up, and this at the same time; 
for without a church somewhere on the globe the human race cannot subsist, because it would have no conjunction with heaven (as shown above in n. 468, 637, 931, 2054). [2] In the present chapter both 
states of the church are treated of, namely, the rising up of a new church, which is represented by "Lot," and the destruction of the old, which is signified by "Sodom and Gomorrah;" as can be seen 
from the Contents. This is why it is here said that the two angels came to Sodom "in the evening;" and why there is told what was done in the evening (verses 1-3), what in the night (verses 4-14), what 
in the morning or rising dawn (verses 15-22), and what after the sun had gone forth (verses 23-26). [3] As the "evening" signifies these states of the church, it also signifies the visitation which 
precedes Judgment; for when a Judgment is close at hand, that is, the salvation of the faithful and the condemnation of the unfaithful, then visitation precedes, or an exploration of what quality they 
are, that is, whether there is any charity and faith. This visitation takes place in the "evening;" and therefore the visitation itself is called "evening," as in Zephaniah: </p>
<p>     Woe to the inhabitants 
of the region of the sea, the nation of the Cherethites. The word of Jehovah is against you, O Canaan, the land of the Philistines; and I will cause to destroy thee, till there shall be no inhabitant. 
The remnant of the house of Judah shall feed in the houses of Ashkelon, in the evening shall they lie down; for Jehovah their God will visit them, and will bring back their captivity (Zeph. 2:5, 7). </p>

<p align="center"><b>Elliott(1983-1999) 2323</b></p><p><b>2323.</b>
That 'evening' means the time when visitation takes place is clear from the meaning of 'evening'. In the Word states of the Church are compared both to seasons of the year and to times of day- the seasons 
of the year being summer, autumn, winter, and spring; the times of day, midday, evening, night, and morning. Such a similarity does indeed exist between the two. The state of the Church which is, 
called 'evening' is a state when charity starts to be no more and as a consequence faith to be no more _ thus a state when the Church is ceasing to exist. This evening is that which is followed by night, 
see <a href="22.htm">22</a>. But another state of the Church - when charity is shining and as a consequence faith, and so when a new Church is arising - is called 'evening'. By this is meant the twilight prior to the 
morning, see <a href="883.htm">883</a>. Thus the word 'evening' means both these states. For when a Church is ceasing to exist the Lord provides for a new one to arise. These two processes take place simultaneously, for 
without a Church somewhere in the world the human race cannot remain in existence because it would have no conjunction with heaven, as shown in <a href="468.htm">468</a>, <a href="637.htm">637</a>, <a href="931.htm">931</a>, <a href="2054.htm">2054</a>. </p>
<p></p>
<p><b>[2]</b>
 In the present chapter both 
states of the Church are dealt with, that is to say, both the rise of a new Church represented by 'Lot' and the destruction of the old meant by 'Sodom and Gomorrah', as may be seen from the paragraphs 
above headed Contents. This is why it is said here that two angels came to Sodom in the evening, and why what happened in the evening is recorded, in verses 1-3, what happened during the night, in verses 4-14, what happened in the morning or at dawn, in verses 15-22, and what happened after sunrise, in verses 23-26. </p>
<p></p>
<p><b>[3]</b>
 Since 'the evening' means these states of the Church it also means the visitation 
that takes place prior to judgement; for when judgement, that is, when the salvation of those who have faith and the condemnation of those who have no faith, is imminent, visitation takes place 
- such visitation being an examination of their character, that is, to see whether any charity or faith is there. This visitation occurs 'in the evening', which also is why visitation itself is called 
'the evening', as in Zephaniah, </p>
<blockquote>
Woe to the inhabitants of the region of the sea, to the nation of the Cherethites! The word of Jehovah is against you, O Canaan, land of the Philistines; and I will 
cause destruction in you until no inhabitant is left. The remnant of the house of Judah will pasture in the houses of Ashkelon, they will lie down in the evening, for Jehovah their God will visit them, 
and bring again their captivity. <a href="http://bible.gospelcom.net/cgi-bin/bible?passage=Zeph%202:%205,%207&amp;version=ESV&amp;interface=print&amp;showfn=yes&amp;showxref">Zeph 2: 5, 7</a>.

Quod `vespera' sit tempus visitationis, constat a significatione `vesperae':  status Ecclesiae in Verbo comparantur et temporibus anni et temporibus diei; temporibus anni, nempe ejus aestati, autumno, 
hiemi et veri; temporibus diei, nempe ejus meridie vesperae, nocti et mane; similiter enim se habent.  Status Ecclesiae qui `vespera' dicitur, est cum nulla amplius charitas, proinde cum nulla fides, 
incipit esse, ita cum Ecclesia desinit esse; haec vespera est quam sequitur nox, videatur n. 22; et est quoque cum charitas elucet, proinde cum fides, ita cum Ecclesia nova exoriatur; haec vespera 
est diluculum ante mane, videatur n. 883; ita `vespera' significat utrumque.  Providetur enim a Domino, cum Ecclesia desinit esse, quod nova exoriatur, et hoc eodem tempore, nam absque Ecclesia alicubi 
in orbe, non subsistere potest genus humanum, quia nulla foret ejus conjunctio cum caelo, ut n. 468, 637, 931, 2054 ostensum est.  [2] In hoc capite agitur de utroque statu Ecclesiae, nempe de ortu 
novae Ecclesiae, quae repraesentatur per `Lotum,' ac de interitu veteris, quae significatur per `Sodomam et Amoram,' ut constare potest a contentis [n. 2312-6]; inde est quod hic dicatur quod duo angeli 
venerint (o)Sodomam in vespera; et quod memoretur quid factum in vespera, vers. 1-3, quid in nocte vers. 4-14, quid mane seu surgente aurora vers. 15-22, et quid postquam sol egressus vers. 23-26. 
 [3] Quia `vespera' illos status Ecclesiae significat,  etiam significat visitationem quae praecedit judicium, nam cum imminet judicium, hoc est, salvatio fidelium et damnatio infidelium, tunc praecedit 
visitatio seu exploratio quales sunt, hoc est, num aliqua charitas et fides; haec visitatio fit `in vespera,' quare etiam ipsa visitatio vocatur vespera, ut apud Zephaniam, 	Vae habitatoribus tractus 
maris, genti Kerethim, verbum Jehovae contra vos, Canaan, terra Philistaeorum, et perdere faciam te, usque ut nullus habitator; reliquiae domus Jehudae pascent in domibus Ashkelonis, in vespera cubabunt, 
quia visitabit eos Jehovah Deus eorum, et reducet captivitatem eorum, ii 5, 7. </p>
