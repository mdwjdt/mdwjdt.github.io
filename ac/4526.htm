<h3 align="center" class="ired">属天的奥秘 第4526节</h3>
<h4 align="center"></h4><p><strong>4526.</strong>至于从前一章末尾开始论述的眼睛视觉的对应关系，要知道，它与属于理解力的事物相对应，因为理解力是内在视觉（简称内视），这种内视在高于尘世之光的光中发挥功能。人之所以能从他在尘世之光中所看到的事物获得聪明，是因为有一种更高级的光，也就是天堂之光流入凭尘世之光变得可见的物体，使它们以代表和对应的方式被看到。事实上，在尘世之光以上的光就是从主发出的光，而主光照整个天堂。出自主的聪明和智慧本身在那里显为光，正是这光产生了人的理解力或内视。当这光通过理解力流入尘世之光的物体时，它就会使它们以代表和对应的方式被看到，因而以理解力被看到。在自然界中运作的眼睛的视觉因对应于在灵界运作的理解力的视觉，故对应于信之真理，因为这些属于纯正的理解力。事实上，真理构成人的整个理解力，因为他的一切思维都围绕着某个事物是否如此，也就它是否真实这个问题。眼睛的视觉对应于信之真理与良善（参看<a href="4410.htm">4410</a>节）。</p>

As to what further regards the correspondence of the sight of the eye, treated of at the end of the foregoing chapter, be it known that its correspondence is with the things which are of the understanding; 
for the understanding is the internal sight, and this internal sight is in a light which is above the light of this world. The reason why man is able to acquire intelligence by means of the things 
which appear before him in the light of this world, is that a higher light (that is, the light of heaven) flows into the objects which are of the light of the world, and causes them to appear representatively 
and correspondently; for the light which is above the light of the world is a light that proceeds from the Lord, who illumines the universal heaven. The very intelligence and wisdom that 
are from the Lord appear there as light. It is this light which produces man's understanding or internal sight, and when it inflows through the understanding into the objects of this world's light, it 
causes them to appear representatively and correspondently, thus intellectually. And as the eyesight which is in the natural world corresponds to the sight of the understanding which is in the spiritual 
world, it corresponds to the truths of faith, because these belong to genuine understanding; for truths produce all man's understanding, inasmuch as all his thought is employed in deciding that a 
thing is so, or is not so; that is, that it is true, or is not true. (That the sight of the eye corresponds to the truths and goods of faith, may be seen above, n. 4410.) </p>

To take further the correspondence of the sight of the eye, begun at the end of the previous chapter, it should be recognized that its correspondence is with the things of the understanding, for the 
understanding is internal sight and this internal sight functions in the light which is above the light of the world. The reason why man is able to acquire intelligence to himself by means of the things 
which are seen by him in the light of the world is that a higher light, or the light of heaven, flows into the objects made visible by the light of the world and causes them to be seen in a representative 
and correspondential fashion. For the light that is above the light of the world is that which proceeds from the Lord who enlightens the whole of heaven. Intelligence and wisdom themselves which 
come from the Lord are seen there as light, and it is this light which constitutes man's understanding or internal sight. When that light is flowing in through the understanding into the objects made 
visible by the light of the world it causes them to be seen in a representative and correspondential fashion, and so to be seen with understanding. And because the sight of the eye which operates in 
the natural world corresponds to the sight of the understanding which operates in the spiritual world, it corresponds to the truths of faith, for these belong to a genuine understanding. Indeed truths 
constitute the whole understanding of man, for every part of his thought revolves around the matter of whether something is so or not so, that is, whether it is true or not true. As regards the sight 
of the eye corresponding to the truths and goods of faith, see above in <a href="4410.htm">4410</a>. </p>

</p><b>4526.</b>
Quod correspondentiam visus qui oculi, de qua ad finem capitis praecedentis incohatum est, ulterius attinet, sciendum quod correspondentia ejus sit cum illis quae sunt intellectus, nam intellectus 
est visus internus, et visus hic internus est in luce quae supra lucem mundi est; quod homo per illa quae ei apparent in luce mundi, possit intelligentiam sibi comparare, est quia lux superior, seu 
lux caeli, influit in objecta quae sunt ex luce mundi, et facit ut appareant repraesentative et correspondenter; </p>
<p>lux enim quae est supra lucem mundi, est quae procedit a Domino Qui illuminat universum 
caelum; ipsa intelligentia et sapientia quae a Domino, apparet ibi ut lux; haec lux est quae facit intellectum seu visum internum hominis; cum illa per intellectum influit in objecta quae sunt 
ex luce mundi, facit ut appareant repraesentative et correspondenter, ac ita intellectualiter.  Et quia visus oculi qui est in mundo naturali, correspondet visui intellectus qui est in mundo spirituali, 
correspondet ille veris fidei, nam haec sunt genuini intellectus; vera enim faciunt omnem intellectum hominis, nam omne {1} cogitationis versatur circa id quod ita sit, vel quod non ita sit, 
hoc est, quod verum vel non verum: quod visus oculi correspondeat veris et bonis fidei, videatur supra n. 4450.      @1 omne enim$ </p>
