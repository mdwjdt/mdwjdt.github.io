<h3 align="center" class="ired">属天的奥秘 第5581节</h3>
<h4 align="center"></h4><p><strong>5581.</strong>“他们的父亲就对他们说”表从教会事物所得来的觉知。这从“说”的含义和以色列的代表清楚可知：在圣言的历史中，“说”是指觉知，如前面频繁所述；以色列，即此处的“父亲”，是指教会。因为“以色列”是指内在的属灵教会，“雅各”是指外在教会（参看<a href="4286.htm">4286</a>，<a href="4292.htm">4292</a>，<a href="4570.htm">4570</a>节）。他被称为“父亲”，是因为在圣言中，“父亲”也表示教会，“母亲”同样表示教会；但“母亲”表示真理方面的教会，而“父亲”表示良善方面的教会。原因在于，教会是属灵婚姻，该婚姻是由作为父亲的良善和作为母亲的真理形成的。</p>

And their father said unto them. That this signifies perception from the things of the church, is evident from the signification of "saying" in the historicals of the Word, as being perception (of which 
often above); and from the representation of Israel, who here is the "father," as being the church (that "Israel" is the internal spiritual church, and "Jacob" the external, may be seen above, n. 
4286, 4292, 4570). He is called "father" because by "father" in the Word is also signified the church, and likewise by "mother;" but by "mother" the church as to truth, and by "father" the church as to 
good. The reason of this is that the church is a spiritual marriage, which is from good as the father, and from truth as a mother. </p>

<p align="center"><b>Elliott(1983-1999) 5581</b></p><p><b>5581.</b>
'That their father said to them' means a perception received from the things that constituted the Church. This is clear from the meaning of 'saying' in the historical narratives of the Word as perception, 
often dealt with already, and from the representation of Israel, to whom 'father' refers here, as the Church. For 'Israel' is the internal spiritual Church, and 'Jacob' the external Church, see <a href="4286.htm">4286</a>, <a href="4292.htm">4292</a>, <a href="4570.htm">4570</a>. The word 'father' is used because in the Word 'father' as well as 'mother' means the Church; but 'mother' means the Church so far as truth is concerned, and 'father' the Church so far 
as good is concerned. The reason for this is that the Church is a spiritual marriage formed from good as the father and truth as the mother. </p>

<p align="center"><b>Latin(1748-1756) 5581</b>
</p><b>5581.</b>
`Et dixit ad illos pater illorum': quod significet perceptionem ab illis quae Ecclesiae, constat ex significatione `dicere' in historicis Verbi quod sit perceptio, de qua saepius prius; et a repraesentatione 
`Israelis' qui hic est pater, quod sit Ecclesia; quod `Israel' sit Ecclesia interna spiritualis, et `Jacob' externa, videatur n. 4286, 4292, 4570; pater dicitur quia per `patrem' in Verbo etiam 
significatur Ecclesia, et quoque per matrem, sed per `matrem' Ecclesia quoad verum, et per `patrem' Ecclesia quoad bonum; causa est quia Ecclesia est conjugium spirituale quod est a bono ut a patre, 
et a vero ut a matre. </p>
