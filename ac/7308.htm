<h3 align="center" class="ired">属天的奥秘 第7308节</h3>
<h4 align="center"></h4><p><strong>7308.</strong>“你要站在河岸迎接他”表与状态一致的一种流注。这从“站着迎接”和“河岸”的含义清楚可知：“站着迎接”是指流注，因为当经上指着“摩西”所代表的神之律法说，它要“站着迎接”“法老”所代表的那些沉浸于虚假并进行侵扰的人时，“站着迎接”无非表示流注和由此而来的接受，因而表示洞察；“河岸”是指那些进行侵扰的人所处于的虚假状态。“埃及河”表示虚假（参看<a href="6693.htm">6693</a>节），在此表示由幻觉所产生的虚假（<a href="7307.htm">7307</a>节）；但是“岸”就像河的一个容器，因为它围住河，将它包括在内，所以它表示这种虚假的状态；因为每一个事物都有自己的状态，它在这状态下并照这状态而存在。</p>

And stand thou to meet him near the bank of the river. That this signifies influx according to the state, is evident from the signification of "standing to meet," as being influx, for when it is said 
of the law Divine which is represented by Moses, that it should "stand to meet" those who are in falsities and infest, who are represented by Pharaoh, nothing else can be signified by "standing to meet" 
than influx and thence reception, and thus a noticing; and from the signification of "the bank of the river," as being the state of falsity in which they were who were infesting. That the "river of 
Egypt" denotes falsity (see n. 6693), here falsity from fallacies (n. 7307); but the "bank," which is like a containant, because it surrounds and includes, denotes the state of this falsity; for everything 
has its state, in which and according to which it is. </p>

<p align="center"><b>Elliott(1983-1999) 7308</b></p><p><b>7308.</b>
'And you are to stand so as to meet him beside the bank of the river' means an influx in keeping with the state. This is clear from the meaning of 'standing to meet' as influx, for when it says - referring 
to the law of God, which is represented by 'Moses' - that it was to stand so as to meet those steeped in falsities who engage in molestation, who are represented by 'Pharaoh', nothing else can 
be meant by 'standing to meet' than influx and consequent reception, and so discernment; and from the meaning of 'the bank of the river' as the state of falsity in which those who engaged in molestation 
would be. 'The river of Egypt' means falsity, see <a href="6693.htm">6693</a>, at this point falsity resulting from illusions, <a href="7307.htm">7307</a>; but its 'bank', which is so to speak its container, since it encompasses and confines it, 
is the state in which that falsity exists. For every individual thing has its own state in which and in keeping with which it exists. </p>

</p><b>7308.</b>
`Et consiste obviam illi juxta ripam fluminis': quod significet influxum secundum statum, constat ex significatione `consistere obviam' quod sit influxus; cum enim dicitur de lege Divina, quae repraesentatur 
per `Moschen' quod consisteret obviam illis qui in falsis et infestant, qui repraesentantur per `Pharaonem,' non aliud per `consistere obviam' {1} potest significari quam influxus et inde receptio, 
et sic apperceptio; et ex significatione `ripae fluminis' quod sit status falsi in quo essent qui infestabant; quod `flumen Aegypti' sit falsum, videatur n. 6693, hic falsum ex fallaciis, n. 7307; 
`ripa' autem, {2}quae est sicut continens, nam circuit et includit, est status illius falsi; unumquodvis enim habet suum statum, in quo et secundum quem illud est. 	@1 i in spirituali$ 	@2 quia$ </p>
