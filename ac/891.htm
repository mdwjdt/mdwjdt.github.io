<h3 align="center" class="ired">属天的奥秘 第891节</h3>
<h4 align="center"></h4><p><strong>891.</strong>“鸽子就再没有回到他那里”表自由的状态。这一点从前面所述，尤其从以下事实可推知：鸽子（或信之真）、其它鸟类、还有牲畜，以及挪亚由于洪水而不再被关在方舟内。只要在方舟里，他就处在奴役、束缚或囚禁的状态，被洪水或虚假折腾。这种状态，连同试探的状态，在前一章用“洪水泛滥在地上四十天，水往上长，浮起方舟，把它从地上漂起”（7:17）、“水势浩大，在地上大大地往上长；方舟漂浮在水面上”来描述。在本章（8:15-18节），人的自由状态用挪亚出了方舟，凡与他同在的活物，首先是鸽子（即源于善的信之真）来描述，因为一切自由皆源于信之善，即源于对善之爱。</p>

<p><strong>[NCE]891.</strong> The symbolism of the dove did not return to him again as a liberated state follows logically. It also follows from the consideration that the dove — religious truth, or the truth of faith — like the other birds, the animals, and Noah, was no longer trapped in the ark by the flood water. As long as it stayed on the ark, buffeted by the flood water (falsity), its state was one of slavery, of captivity or imprisonment. This state, along with the state of trial, is portrayed above in <a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_891/bible_king-james-version_genesis_7_17" target=_top>Genesis 7:17</a>, which said that the waters grew and lifted the ark and the ark rose off the earth. It is portrayed in <a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_891/bible_king-james-version_genesis_7_18" target=_top>Genesis 7:18</a> as well, which said that the water strengthened and the ark went on the face of the water. Its state of freedom is depicted in the fact that not only Noah but everything else with him too went out of the ark (which occurs later in the present chapter, verses <a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_891/bible_king-james-version_genesis_8_16" target=_top>16</a>, <a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_891/bible_king-james-version_genesis_8_17" target=_top>17</a>, <a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_891/bible_king-james-version_genesis_8_18-19" target=_top>18-19</a>).{*1} The first of them all to leave was the dove, that is, religious truth that grows out of goodness, because all freedom comes from the goodness connected with faith, that is, from a love for what is good.<br /><br /><strong>Footnotes:</strong><br />{*1} The verse references here are substituted for the first Latin edition's 15, 16, 17, 18.

And she returned not again unto him anymore. That this signifies a free state, follows, and indeed from the fact that the dove (or the truth of faith) and the other birds, as also the beasts, and Noah 
himself, were no longer kept in the ark on account of the waters of the flood. So long as he was in the ark, he was in a state of slavery, or of bondage or imprisonment, tossed about by the waters of 
the flood, or falsities. This state, together with the state of temptation, is described in the preceding chapter (verse 17), by the waters increasing and bearing up the ark, and by the ark being lifted 
up above the earth; also in the next verse by the waters being strengthened and the ark going on the face of the waters. In the present chapter (verses 15 to 18) the man's state of freedom is described 
by Noah going forth from the ark, and all that were with him, the dove first of all (that is, the truth of faith from good), for all freedom is from the good of faith, that is, from the love of good. </p>

'The dove did not return to him any more' means a state of freedom. This follows from what was said above, in particular from the fact that the dove, or the truth of faith - like the other birds, and 
also the beasts, and so Noah too - was no longer confined to the ark on account of the flood-waters. All the time he was in the ark it was a state of slavery, that is, a state of bondage or imprisonment, 
with the flood-waters, or falsities, tossing him about. That state is described along with the state of temptation in Chapter 7:17 above, where it is said that 'the waters increased and lifted up 
the ark, and raised it above the earth', and also in 7:18 that 'the waters grew stronger and the ark went over the face<A name="fntext1"></a><A href="#fn1"><sup>a</sup></a> of the waters'. His state of freedom is described in verses 15-18 of the present 
chapter not only by Noah's going out of the ark but also by all the other living things accompanying him - the dove, that is, the truth of faith deriving from good, first of all, for all freedom has 
its origin in the good of faith, that is, in the love of good.

Quod 'columba non rediret ad illum amplius' significet statum liberum, inde nunc sequitur, et quidem ex eo quod columba, seu verum fidei, sicut ceterae aves, ut et bestiae, ita Noahus, non amplius in 
arca teneretur pro aquis diluvii; quamdiu in arca erat, status servitutis, seu status captivitatis aut carceris erat, agitantibus eum aquis diluvii seu falsis, qui status cum statu tentationis describitur 
in cap. praec. vers. 17, quod 'aquae creverint et sustulerint arcam,' et quod 'elevata arca de super terra'; tum vers. 18 quod 'corroboratae aquae, et iverit arca de super faciebus aquarum'; status 
ejus libertatis describitur, quod non solum exiverit ex arca Noahus, sed etiam omnia quae (x)cum illo fuerunt, in hoc capite vers. seq. 15;-18; ita omnium primum 'columba,' hoc est, verum fidei ex 
bono; nam omne liberum est ex bono fidei, hoc est, ex amore boni. </p>
