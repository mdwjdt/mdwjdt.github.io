<h3 align="center" class="ired">属天的奥秘 第8023节</h3>
<h4 align="center"></h4><p><strong>8023.</strong>后来，这些天使通过不怎么离散的观念与我交谈；我几乎察觉不到它们之间有任何空隙。在我看来，这就像是包含在那些只关注从话语中抽象出来的意义之人所说的话中的意义。这种言语对我来说比之前的更容易理解，并且包含更多东西。和之前的那种言语一样，它也流入我的脸，但这种言语的性质使得流注更为连续。然而，和前一种不同，它不是从嘴唇，而是从眼睛开始。他们说，这也是他们与自己星球的人，不过是与那些比其他人享有更内在的领悟力和洞察力的人对话的一种方式。</p>

Afterward they spoke with me by means of ideas still less discrete, insomuch that scarcely any interval was perceivable; it was in my perception like the meaning of words with those who attend only to 
the meaning abstractedly from the words. This speech was more intelligible to me than the former, and was also more full. It flowed into the face in like manner as the former, but the influx was more 
continuous, in accordance with the nature of the speech. It did not, however, begin from the lips, like the former, but from the eyes. They said that so also do they speak with their own people on their 
earth; but with those there who enjoy a more interior sense and discernment than the rest. </p>

After this these angels communicated with me by means of ideas even less distinct from one another; I could detect hardly any spaces at all between them. To my mind it was like the meaning contained 
in words spoken by those who concentrate entirely on the meaning without thinking about the words. This kind of communicating was more intelligible to me than the first, and also contained more. It passed 
into my face as the first kind had, but the very nature of the method of communication made the inflow more continuous. However it did not begin, as the first had done, at the lips, but at the eyes. 
They said that this too was a way in which they communicate with the people on their planet, those there who are endowed with deeper insight and discernment than the rest. </p>

Postea loquebantur mecum per ideas adhuc {1}minus discretas, adeo ut vix aliquid interstitiale {2}perciperetur; erat in mea perceptione sicut sensus vocum apud illos qui solum ad sensum abstracte a 
vocibus attendunt; haec loquela mihi intelligibilior priore erat et quoque erat plenior; influebat similiter ac prior in faciem, sed influxus erat secundum quale loquelae magis continuus; verum non incepit 
ut prior a labiis sed ab oculis.  Dicebant quod etiam ita loquantur cum suis in sua tellure, sed cum illis ibi qui {3}prae reliquis gaudent interiore sensu ac apperceptione. 	@1 magis continuas$ 	@2
