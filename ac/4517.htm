<h3 align="center" class="ired">属天的奥秘 第4517节</h3>
<h4 align="center"></h4><p><strong>4517.</strong>“就是在迦南人和比利洗人中”表那些处于良善与真理的人。这从“迦南人”和“比利洗人”的含义清楚可知：“迦南人”在此是指那些处于教会良善的人；“比利洗人”是指那些处于教会真理的人。“迦南人和比利洗人”之所以具有这样的含义，是因为古教会在那地仍存在于这些人当中，如刚才所述（<a href="4516.htm">4516</a>节）。事实上，迦南地既有属上古教会的人（参看<a href="4447.htm">4447</a>，<a href="4454.htm">4454</a>节），也有属古教会，尤其被称为希伯来教会的古教会之人；这就是为何迦南地的居民通常被称为“希伯来人”（创世记<a href="http://39-27.cn/创40.15.htm">40:15</a>），还有祭坛，并献祭；也是为何他们沦为偶像崇拜者之后，经上经常吩咐要摧毁他们的祭坛。因此，只要教会或教会的某种事物仍存留在他们当中，“迦南人”就表示教会的良善，“比利洗人”就表示教会的真理。但是，一旦他们当中的教会一切事物到了尽头，“迦南人”就表示邪恶，而“比利洗人”则表示虚假（<a href="1573.htm">1573</a>，<a href="1574.htm">1574</a>节）。</p>

To the Canaanite and the Perizzite. That this signifies who are in good and truth, is evident from the signification of the "Canaanite," as here being those who were in the good of the church, and of 
the "Perizzite," as being those who were in the truth of the church. The reason why "the Canaanite and the Perizzite" have this signification is that the Ancient Church was still among them there, as 
stated just above (n. 4516). For in the land of Canaan there existed people of the Most Ancient Church (see n. 4447, 4454), and also people of the Ancient Church, especially from that Ancient Church 
called "Hebrew," for which reason the inhabitants of the land of Canaan were in general called "Hebrews" (Gen. 40:15), and also had altars, and sacrificed, and therefore after they had become idolaters 
the destruction of their altars was so frequently enjoined. So long therefore as the church or anything of the church remained among them, the good of the church was signified by the "Canaanite," and 
the truth of the church by the "Perizzite." But when everything of the church with them, had been consummated, evil was signified by the "Canaanite," and falsity by the "Perizzite" (n. 1573, 1574). </p>

<p align="center"><b>Elliott(1983-1999) 4517</b></p><p><b>4517.</b>
'To the Canaanite and the Perizzite' means those who are governed by good and truth. This is clear from the meaning of 'the Canaanite' here as those who are governed by the good of the Church, and 'the 
Perizzite' those who are governed by the truth of the Church. Canaanite and Perizzite have these meanings because the Ancient Church continued to exist in that land among those people, as stated just 
above in <a href="4516.htm">4516</a>. For in that land there were people who belonged to the Most Ancient Church, see <a href="4447.htm">4447</a>, <a href="4454.htm">4454</a>. There were also those who belonged to the Ancient Church, in particular the one called the 
Hebrew Church, which was why people from the land of Canaan were in general called the Hebrews, <a href="http://bible.gospelcom.net/cgi-bin/bible?passage=Gen%2040:15&amp;version=ESV&amp;interface=print&amp;showfn=yes&amp;showxref">Gen 40:15</a>, and had altars and offered sacrifices, and why after they had become idolaters the command 
was frequently given for their altars to be destroyed. Therefore so long as the Church or something like the Church remained with them 'the Canaanites' meant the good of the Church and 'the Perizzites' 
the truth of the Church. But once everything of the Church with these had reached its end 'Canaanite' means evil and 'Perizzite' falsify, <a href="1573.htm">1573</a>, <a href="1574.htm">1574</a>. </p>

`Cananaeo et Perizzaeo': quod significet qui in bono et vero, constat ex significatione `Cananaei' quod hic sint qui in Ecclesiae bono, `et Perizzaei' qui in Ecclesiae vero; quod Cananaeus et Perizzaeus 
illa significent, est quia adhuc ibi apud illos erat Antiqua Ecclesia, ut mox supra (t)n. 4516 dictum; </p>
<p>fuerunt enim ibi qui ab Antiquissima Ecclesia, videatur n. 4447, 4454; et fuerunt qui 
ab Antiqua, imprimis ab illa quae Ecclesia Hebraea dicta est, quapropter illi qui e terra Canaane fuerunt, in genere vocati sunt Hebraei, Gen. xl 15, (m)et quoque {1} habuerunt altaria et sacrificabant, 
ideo {2} postquam idololatrae facti sunt, toties mandatum ut altaria eorum destruerentur;(n) quamdiu itaque Ecclesia aut aliquid Ecclesiae apud illos remansit, per `Cananaeum' significatur Ecclesiae 
bonum, et per `Perizzaeum' Ecclesiae verum; </p>
<p>at cum omne Ecclesiae apud illos consummatum erat, tunc per `Cananaeum' significabatur malum, et per `Perizzaeum' falsum, n. 1573, 1574.      @1
