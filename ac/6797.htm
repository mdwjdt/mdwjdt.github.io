<h4 align="center"></h4><p><strong>6797.</strong>出埃及记2:23-25.过了多日，埃及王死了；以色列人因作苦工，就叹息哀求，他们因作苦工的哀声上达于神。神听见他们的唉哼，神就记念祂与亚伯拉罕、以撒、雅各所立的约。神看顾以色列人，神也认识（他们）。<br />“过了多日”表状态的众多变化之后。“埃及王死了”表之前掌权的虚假的终结。“以色列人因作苦工，就叹息”表由于竭力征服教会真理而引起的悲伤。“哀求”表呼求帮助。“他们因作苦工的哀声上达于神”表他们蒙垂听。“神听见他们的唉哼”表帮助。“神就记念祂与亚伯拉罕、以撒、雅各所立的约”表由于通过主的神性人身而与教会的结合。“神看顾以色列人”表祂赐予教会信。“神也认识（他们）”表祂赐予（它）仁。</p>

Verses 23-25. And it came to pass in these many days that the king of Egypt died, and the sons of Israel sighed by reason of the bondage, and they cried, and their cry came up unto God by reason of the 
bondage. And God heard their groaning, and God remembered His covenant with Abraham, with Isaac, and with Jacob. And God saw the sons of Israel, and God took knowledge. "And it came to pass in these 
many days," signifies after many changes of state; "that the king of Egypt died," signifies the end of the former falsity; "and the sons of Israel sighed by reason of the bondage," signified sorrow 
on account of the attempt to subjugate the truth of the church; "and they cried," signifies entreaty; "and their cry came up unto God by reason of the bondage," signifies that they were heard; "and God 
heard their groaning," signifies aid; "and God remembered His covenant with Abraham, with Isaac, and with Jacob," signifies by reason of conjunction with the church through the Lord's Divine Human; 
"and God saw the sons of Israel," signifies that He endowed the church with faith; "and God took knowledge," signifies that He endowed with charity. </p>

Verses 2-25 And it happened in [the course of] these many days, that the king of Egypt died, and the children of Israel sighed because of their hard service, and cried out; and their cry came up to God 
because of their hard service. And God heard their groaning, and God remembered His covenant with Abraham, with Isaac, and with Jacob. And God saw the children of Israel, and God knew [them].  </p>

it happened in [the course of] these many days' means after quite a number of changes of state. 'That the king of Egypt died' means the end of the falsity that had reigned previously. 'And the children 
of Israel sighed because of their hard service' means grief on account of the endeavour to subdue the truth of the Church. 'And cried out' means a calling for help. 'And their cry came up to God 
because of their hard service' means that they were heard. 'And God heard their groaning' means help. 'And God remembered His covenant with Abraham, with Isaac, and with Jacob' means on account of being 
joined to the Church through the Lord's Divine Human. 'And God saw the children of Israel' means that He endowed the Church with faith. 'And God knew them means that [He endowed it] with charity. </p>

Vers. 23-25.  Et factum in diebus multis his, et moriebatur rex Aegypti, et suspirabant filii Israelis e servitio, et clamabant; et ascendit clamor illorum ad Deum e servitia.  Et audivit Deus gemitum 
illorum, et recordatus est Deus foederis Sui cum Abrahamo, cum Jischako, et cum Jacobo.  Et vidit Deus filios Israelis, et cognovit Deus.  `Et factum in diebus multis his' significat post status mutationes 
plures: `et moriebatur rex Aegypti' significat finem falsi prioris: `et suspirabant filii Israelis e servitio' significat dolorem ob conatum subjugationis veri Ecclesiae: `et clamabant' significat 
implorationem: `et ascendit clamor illorum ad Deum e servitio' significat quod auditi: `et audivit Deus gemitum illorum' significat opem: `et recordatus est Deus foederis Sui cum Abrahamo, cum Jischako, 
et cum Jacobo' significat ob conjunctionem cum Ecclesia per Divinum Humanum Domini: `et vidit Deus filios Israelis' significat quod Ecclesiam fide donavit: `et cognovit {1}illos, significat quod
