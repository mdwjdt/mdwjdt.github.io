<h3 align="center" class="ired">属天的奥秘 第3892节</h3>
<h4 align="center"></h4><p><strong>3892.</strong>上古之人是属天之人，比起所有其他人，更是处于对主之爱。他们告诉我，他们没有如他们后代那样的外在呼吸，而是拥有内在呼吸。他们说，他们与伴随他们的天使共呼吸，因为他们处于属天之爱。我还被告知，其呼吸的状态完全取决于其爱和源于这爱之信的状态。有关这个问题的阐述，可参看前文（<a href="608.htm">608</a>，<a href="805.htm">805</a>，<a href="1118.htm">1118</a>-<a href="1120.htm">1120</a>节）。</p>

I have been informed by the most ancient people, who were celestial men, and above all other men were in love to the Lord, that they had not external respiration such as their posterity had, but internal; 
but that they respired with the angels, with whom they were in fellowship because they were in celestial love. I was further informed that their states of respiration were altogether according to 
their states of love and of the derivative faith. (See what has been related above on this subject, n. 608, 805, 1118-1120.) </p>

<p align="center"><b>Elliott(1983-1999) 3892</b></p><p><b>3892.</b>
I have been told by the most ancient people who were celestial and who more than any others were governed by love to the Lord that they did not have external breathing like those who came after them 
but internal breathing. They have said that they breathed with angels whose company they shared because they were governed by heavenly love. I have also been told that their state of breathing was determined 
entirely by their states of love and of faith deriving from it. On these points see what has been related already in <a href="608.htm">608</a>, <a href="805.htm">805</a>, <a href="1118.htm">1118</a>- <a href="1120.htm">1120</a>. </p>

</p><b>3892.</b>
Ab antiquissimis qui caelestes homines fuerunt, et prae reliqui in amore in Dominam, informatus sum quod illi non respirationem externam qualem posteri illorum, sed internam habuerint, et quod respiraverint 
cur angelis cum quibus in consortio fuerunt, ex causa quia in caelesti amore fuerunt informatus etiam quod status eorum respirationis se habuerint prorsus secundum status amoris eorum et 
inde fidei, de quibus videantur quae prius n. 608, 805, 1118-1120 relata sunt. </p>
