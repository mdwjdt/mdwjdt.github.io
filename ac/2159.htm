<h3 align="center" class="ired">属天的奥秘 第2159节</h3>
<h4 align="center"></h4><p><strong>2159.</strong>“仆人”是指变成神性之前的主之人身。这从先知书的很多经文清楚看出来。如前面数次所述，原因乃是这样：在主脱去人身，并将其变成神性之前，祂的人身只不过是仆人。主的人身来自母亲，因而是有瑕疵的，具有来自母亲的遗传元素。而主藉着试探的争战所要战胜并彻底逐出的，就是这遗传元素。祂甚至做到无一丝瑕疵和来自母亲的遗传元素剩下的地步，事实上，直到最后，凡来自母亲之物都荡然无存。因此，祂完全脱去来自母亲的一切，以至于不再是她的儿子，如祂自己在马可福音中所教导的：<br />他们对他说，看哪，你母亲和你弟兄在外边找你。耶稣回答他们说，谁是我的母亲？谁是我的弟兄？就四面观看那周围坐着的人，说，看哪，我的母亲，我的弟兄！凡遵行神旨意的人，就是我的弟兄姐妹和母亲了。（马可福音<a href="http://39-27.cn/可3.32.htm">3:32</a>-<a href="http://39-27.cn/可3.35.htm">35</a>；马太福音<a href="http://39-27.cn/太12.46.htm">12:46</a>-<a href="http://39-27.cn/太12.49.htm">49</a>；路加福音<a href="http://39-27.cn/路8.20.htm">8:20</a>，<a href="http://39-27.cn/路8.21.htm">21</a>）<br />祂一旦脱去这人身，就会披上神性人，祂凭借这神性人自称人子，我们在新约中多次看到这个词，还有“神的儿子”。主所说的“人子”是指真理本身，而“神的儿子”是指属于其变成神性时的人性本质的良善本身。前一种状态是主谦卑的状态，而后一种状态是指其荣耀的状态，如前所述（<a href="1999.htm">1999</a>节）。<br />在前一种状态，即谦卑的状态下，由于祂仍具有不完美的人身，所以祂将耶和华当作不同于祂自己的一位来敬拜，事实上，就像一个仆人。因为相对神性而言，人身无非是一个仆人。因此，在圣言中，这人身也作为“仆人”被提及，如以赛亚书：<br />因我为自己的缘故，又为我仆人大卫的缘故，必保护拯救这城。（以赛亚书<a href="http://39-27.cn/赛37.35.htm">37:35</a>）<br />这论及亚述人，一位使者在亚述营中杀了十八万五千人。“大卫”表主，由于祂将要到来，故就人身而言，祂被称为“仆人”。在圣言中，“大卫”表主（参看<a href="1888.htm">1888</a>节）。<br />同一先知书：<br />看哪！我的仆人，我所扶持、所拣选、灵魂所喜悦的。我已将我的灵赐给他，他必将公理传给列族。（以赛亚书<a href="http://39-27.cn/赛42.1.htm">42:1</a>）<br />这明显论及主，祂处于人身时，论及祂所用的词是“仆人”和“所拣选的”。<br />除了我的仆人外，谁还那么瞎呢？谁如同我差遣的使者那么聋呢？谁瞎得像那与我和好的，谁瞎得像耶和华的仆人呢？（以赛亚书<a href="http://39-27.cn/赛42.19.htm">42:19</a>）<br />这也论及主，祂处于人身时，论及祂所用的词同样是“仆人”和“使者”。<br /><br />耶和华说，你们是我的见证，我所拣选的仆人。你们可以知道，且信服我，又明白我就是祂。（以赛亚书<a href="http://39-27.cn/赛43.10.htm">43:10</a>）<br /><br />但我却说，耶和华从我出胎，造就我作他的仆人，要使雅各归向他，使以色列到祂那里聚集。他说，你作我的仆人，使雅各众支派复兴，尚为小事；我还要使你作列族的光，叫你施行我的救恩，直到地极。（以赛亚书<a href="http://39-27.cn/赛49.5.htm">49:5</a>，<a href="http://39-27.cn/赛49.6.htm">6</a>）<br />这也明显论及主和作“列族的光”并“施行救恩，直到地极”之前祂的人身。<br />你们中间谁是敬畏耶和华、听从祂仆人声音的？这人行在暗中，没有亮光。当倚靠耶和华的名，仗赖自己的神。（以赛亚书<a href="http://39-27.cn/赛50.10.htm">50:10</a>）<br />“仆人”同样表主的人身。“耶和华仆人的声音”表示祂处于人身时教导真理之路。<br /><br />耶和华必在你们前头行；以色列的神必将你们聚集起来。我的仆人行事必有智慧，必被高举上升，且升为至高。（以赛亚书<a href="http://39-27.cn/赛52.12.htm">52:12</a>，<a href="http://39-27.cn/赛52.13.htm">13</a>）<br />“仆人”明显用来论及主，这时，祂处于人身，因为经上论到祂时说祂“必被高举上升，且升为至高”。<br />他没有佳形，也没有威仪，我们看见他的时候，他也无美貌。他被藐视，是忧患之人，多受病痛。耶和华却定意将他压伤，使他受苦。他若献灵魂为赎罪祭，必看见自己的种，并且延长他的日子，耶和华的旨意必在他手中亨通。他必看见自己灵魂劳苦的功效，便心满意足。有许多人因认识我的义仆得称为义，并且他要担当他们的罪孽。（以赛亚书<a href="http://39-27.cn/赛53.2.htm">53:2</a>，<a href="http://39-27.cn/赛53.3.htm">3</a>，<a href="http://39-27.cn/赛53.10.htm">10</a>，<a href="http://39-27.cn/赛53.11.htm">11</a>）<br />此处如本章全部章节那样，公开论及主谦卑的状态。经上还说，这时，祂处于不完美的人身，也就是说，祂是“忧患之人，多受病痛”，并且“自己灵魂劳苦”等等。在这种状态下，祂被称作“仆人”。</p>

That the "servant" denotes the human that appertained to the Lord, before it was made Divine, may be seen from many passages in the Prophets. The reason is-as already shown several times-that until He 
had put it off and made it Divine the human that appertained to the Lord was merely a servant. The human that appertained to Him was from the mother, thus was infirm, having with it from the mother 
an hereditary which by means of the combats of temptations He overcame and utterly expelled, insomuch that nothing was left of that which was infirm and hereditary from the mother, nay, at last there 
remained not anything whatever from the mother. Thus He entirely put off all that was from the mother, and therefore was no longer her son, as also He himself says in Mark: </p>
<p>     They said unto Him, Behold 
Thy mother and Thy brethren without seek for Thee: and He answered them, saying, Who is My mother, or My brethren? And looking round on them that sat about Him, He said, Behold My mother and My 
brethren; for whosoever shall do the will of God, the same is My brother, and My sister, and My mother (Mark 3:32-35; Matt. 12:46-49; Luke 8:20, 21). [2] And when He had put off this human, He put on 
the Divine Human, from which He called Himself the "Son of man," as we find many times in the Word of the New Testament; and also the "Son of God;" and by the "Son of man" He meant the truth itself, 
and by the "Son of God" the good itself, which belonged to His Human Essence when this was made Divine. The former state was that of the Lord's humiliation, but the latter that of His glorification (treated 
of before, n. 1999). [3] In the former state, namely, that of humiliation, when as yet He had appertaining to Him an infirm human, He adored Jehovah as one other than Himself, and indeed like 
a servant; for relatively to the Divine the human is nothing else, on which account in the Word the term "servant" is predicated of that human, as in Isaiah: </p>
<p>     I will defend this city to save it, 
for Mine own sake, and for My servant David's sake (Isa. 37:35), where the Assyrians are treated of, in whose camp a hundred and eighty-five thousand were smitten by an angel. "David" denotes the Lord, 
who, as He was to come, in respect to the human is called a "servant." (That in the Word "David" denotes the Lord, may be seen above, n. 1888.)  [4] In the same Prophet: </p>
<p>     Behold My servant upon 
whom I will lean; My chosen, My soul is well pleased. I have put My spirit upon him; he shall bring forth judgment unto the nations (Isa. 42:1), manifestly concerning the Lord, of whom, when He was 
in the human, the terms "servant" and "chosen" are predicated. Again: </p>
<p>     Who is blind but My servant? and deaf, as the angel I will send? who is blind as the perfect one, and blind as the servant 
of Jehovah? (Isa. 42:19), where also the Lord is spoken of; and of whom in like manner the terms "servant" and "angel" are predicated when He was in the human. [5] Again: </p>
<p>     Ye are My witnesses, 
saith Jehovah, and My servant whom I have chosen; that ye may know and believe Me, and understand that I am He (Isa. 43:10). Again: </p>
<p>     Said Jehovah, My Former from the womb to be His servant; to 
bring Jacob again unto Him, and that Israel be gathered unto Him; and He said, Thou art a slight thing that thou shouldest be My servant, to set up the tribes of Jacob I have given thee for a light of 
the nations to be My salvation unto the extremity of the earth (Isa. 49:5, 6),      where also the Lord and His human are manifestly treated of before He was made the "light of the nations," and "salvation 
unto the extremity of the earth." Again: </p>
<p>     Who is among you that feareth Jehovah, that heareth the voice of His servant, who walketh in darkness, and hath no brightness? let him trust in 
the name of Jehovah, and lean upon His God (Isa. 50:10).      "Servant" here also denotes the human that appertained to the Lord; and that He was in this human and taught the way of truth, is the "voice 
of the servant of Jehovah."  [6] Again: </p>
<p>     Jehovah goeth before you, and the God of Israel gathereth you. Behold, My servant shall act prudently, he shall be lifted up, and shall be exalted, and 
shall be raised up exceedingly (Isa. 5212, 13). It is evident that "servant" is here predicated of the Lord when He was in the human; for it is said of Him that He "shall be lifted up, exalted, and 
raised up." Again: </p>
<p>     He hath no form and no honor; we saw him, but there was no appearance; He was despised, a man of sorrows, acquainted with disease. Jehovah willed to bruise him; He made him 
infirm; if he shall make his soul guilt, he shall see seed, he shall prolong days, and the will of Jehovah shall prosper by his hand; he shall see of the labor of his soul, he shall be satisfied; by his 
knowledge shall My righteous servant justify many; and he himself hath carried their iniquities (Isa;. 53:2, 3, 10, 11). Here, as in the whole of this chapter, the Lord's state of humiliation is openly 
treated of; and it is also said that He was then in an infirm human, namely, that He was a "man of sorrows, acquainted with disease, infirm, was in the labor of His soul," besides a number of other 
statements, in which state He is called "servant." </p>

<p align="center"><b>Elliott(1983-1999) 2159</b></p><p><b>2159.</b>
That 'servant' means the Lord's human before it was made Divine becomes clear from many places in the Prophets. The reason, which has been given frequently already, is this: The Lord's human, before 
He cast it off and made it Divine, was nothing else than a servant. His human came from the mother and was for that reason imperfect. From her it possessed a hereditary element which He overcame and utterly 
cast aside by means of the conflicts brought about by temptations. He did so even to the point when nothing was left of the imperfect and hereditary element received from the mother, indeed until 
at length nothing whatever from the mother remained. He cast off that which came from the mother so completely that He was no longer her son, as He also Himself declares in Mark, </p>
<p>They said to Jesus, 
Behold, Your mother and Your brothers are outside, asking for You. And He answered them. saying, Who is My mother, or My brothers? And looking around on those who were sitting around Him He said, 
Behold My mother and My brothers! For whoever does the will of God is My brother, and My sister, and My mother. Mark <a href="3.htm">3</a> <a href="32.htm">32</a>-<a href="35.htm">35</a>; <a href="http://bible.gospelcom.net/cgi-bin/bible?passage=Matt%2012:%2046-50&amp;version=ESV&amp;interface=print&amp;showfn=yes&amp;showxref">Matt 12: 46-50</a>; <a href="http://bible.gospelcom.net/cgi-bin/bible?passage=Luke%208:-20-21&amp;version=ESV&amp;interface=print&amp;showfn=yes&amp;showxref">Luke 8:-20-21</a>. </p>
<p></p>
<p><b>[2]</b>
 Once He had cast off this human He 
put on the Divine Human, by virtue of which He called Himself the Son of Man, as may be seen many times in the New Testament Word, and also the Son of God. By 'the Son of Man' He meant truth itself and 
by 'the Son of God' good itself which belonged to His Human Essence once this had been made Divine. The former state was that of the Lord's humiliation but the latter that of His glorification, which 
has been dealt with already in <a href="1999.htm">1999</a>. </p>
<p></p>
<p><b>[3]</b>
 In the former state, namely the state of humiliation, when He still had the imperfect human with Him, He worshipped Jehovah as one other than Himself, and 
was indeed like a servant, for the imperfect human is by comparison nothing else. In the Word also therefore that human is referred to as 'a servant', as in Isaiah, </p>
<blockquote>
I will protect this city to save 
it for My own sake and for the sake of David My servant. <a href="http://bible.gospelcom.net/cgi-bin/bible?passage=Isa%2037:%2035&amp;version=ESV&amp;interface=print&amp;showfn=yes&amp;showxref">Isa 37: 35</a>. 
</blockquote>
<p>This refers to the Assyrians in whose camp an angel slew a hundred and eighty-five thousand. 'David' stands for the Lord who, 
because He is yet to come, is, as regards the human, called 'a servant'. That 'David' in the Word stands for the Lord, see <a href="1888.htm">1888</a>. </p>
<p></p>
<p><b>[4]</b>
 In the same prophet, </p>
<blockquote>
Behold, My servant on whom I will lean, 
My chosen [in whom] My soul is well pleased. I have put My spirit upon him; he will bring forth judgement to the nations. <a href="http://bible.gospelcom.net/cgi-bin/bible?passage=Isa%2042:%201&amp;version=ESV&amp;interface=print&amp;showfn=yes&amp;showxref">Isa 42: 1</a>. 
</blockquote>
<p>This is a plain reference to the Lord, of whom, when He was in 
the human, the expressions 'servant' and 'chosen one' are used. In the same prophet, </p>
<blockquote>
Who is blind but My servant, and deaf as My angel<A name="fntext1"></a><A href="#fn1"><sup>a</sup></a> whom I will send? Who is blind as the perfect one, and blind 
as the servant or Jehovah? <a href="http://bible.gospelcom.net/cgi-bin/bible?passage=Isa%2042:%2019&amp;version=ESV&amp;interface=print&amp;showfn=yes&amp;showxref">Isa 42: 19</a>. 
</blockquote>
<p>This too is a reference to the Lord, of whom in a similar way, when He was in the human, the expressions 'servant' and 'angel' are used. </p>
<p></p>
<p><b>[5]</b>
 In the same 
prophet, </p>
<blockquote>
You are My witnesses, said Jehovah, and My servant whom I have chosen, that you may know and believe Me, and understand that I am He. <a href="http://bible.gospelcom.net/cgi-bin/bible?passage=Isa%2043:%2010&amp;version=ESV&amp;interface=print&amp;showfn=yes&amp;showxref">Isa 43: 10</a>. 
</blockquote>
<p>In the same prophet, </p>
<blockquote>
[Then] said Jehovah 
who formed me from the worm, to be a servant to Him, to bring back Jacob to Him, and that Israel might be gathered to Him - He said, It is a light thing that you should be a servant to Me to raise 
up the tribes of Jacob. I have given you as a light of the nations, to be My salvation right to the ends of the earth. <a href="http://bible.gospelcom.net/cgi-bin/bible?passage=Isa%2049:%205,%206&amp;version=ESV&amp;interface=print&amp;showfn=yes&amp;showxref">Isa 49: 5, 6</a>. 
</blockquote>
<p>This too is a plain reference to the Lord and to His human 
before it was made 'a light of the nations' and 'a salvation to the ends of the earth'. In the same prophet, </p>
<blockquote>
Who among you fears Jehovah, hearkens to the voice of His servant who walks in darkness 
and has no brightness? Let him trust in the name of Jehovah and lean on his God. <a href="http://bible.gospelcom.net/cgi-bin/bible?passage=Isa%2050:%2010&amp;version=ESV&amp;interface=print&amp;showfn=yes&amp;showxref">Isa 50: 10</a>. 
</blockquote>
<p>'Servant' again stands for the Lord's human. His teaching of the way of truth, while He was in that Human, 
is meant by 'the voice of Jehovah's servant'. </p>
<p></p>
<p><b>[6]</b>
 In the same prophet, </p>
<blockquote>
Jehovah goes before you, and the God of Israel gathers you up. Behold, My servant will deal wisely; he will be raised up 
and exalted and lifted up very high. <a href="http://bible.gospelcom.net/cgi-bin/bible?passage=Isa%2052:%2012,%2013&amp;version=ESV&amp;interface=print&amp;showfn=yes&amp;showxref">Isa 52: 12, 13</a>. 
</blockquote>
<p>'Servant' is clearly used in reference to the Lord when He was in the human, because it is said of Him that He will be raised up, exalted, and 
lifted up. In the same prophet, </p>
<blockquote>
He had no form and no honour. We saw him, but there was no beauty in him. He was despised, a man of sorrows, acquainted with sickness. Jehovah was willing to bruise 
him and make him imperfect. If he makes his soul guilt he will see his seed he will prolong his days, and the will of Jehovah will prosper by his hand. He will see [the fruit of] the travail of his 
soul and be satisfied; by his knowledge will the righteous one My servant make many righteous; and He has borne their iniquities. <a href="http://bible.gospelcom.net/cgi-bin/bible?passage=Isa%2053:%202,%203,%2010,%2011&amp;version=ESV&amp;interface=print&amp;showfn=yes&amp;showxref">Isa 53: 2, 3, 10, 11</a>. 
</blockquote>
<p>Here reference is openly made, as in the whole 
of this chapter, to the Lord's state of humiliation. The fact that in that state He was in the imperfect human is also declared, namely in the statements that He was 'a man of sorrows, acquainted with 
grief', 'was made imperfect', and experienced 'the travail of his soul', besides many other statements, in which state He is referred to as 'a servant'.

Quod `servus' sit humanum apud Dominum antequam Divinum factum, constare potest ex pluribus locis apud Propheta' causa est, de qua aliquoties prius, quod humanum apud Dominum non aliud fuerit, antequam 
illud exuerit, et Divinum fecerit: humanum apud Ipsum fuit ex matre, ita infirmum, secum habens inde hereditarium, quod per tentationum pugnas {1} evicit et prorsus expuli usque adeo ut nihil reliqui 
de infirmo et hereditario (c)ex matre habuerit, immo tandem nec quicquam a matre; sic ut exuerit prorsus maternum ut non amplius filius ejus; quemadmodum etiam Ipse dicit, apud Marcum, 	Dixerunt 
Jesu, Ecce mater Tua, et fratres Tui foris quaerunt Te; et {2} respondit illis, dicens, Quae est mater Mea, aut fratres Me et circumspiciens circumcirca, qui circum Ipsum sedebant, dixi Ecce mater Mea, 
et fratres Mei; quisquis namque fecerit voluntatem Dei, hic frater Meus, et soror Mea, et mater Mea, iii 32-35; Matth. xii 46-49 [A.V. 46-50]; Luc. viii 20, 21. [2] Cumque exuerit hoc humanum, induit 
Humanum Divinum, ex quo appellavit Se `Filium hominis,' ut pluries in Verbo Novi Testamenti, tum etiam `Filium Dei'; et per `Filium hominis' significavit ipsum verum et per `Filium Dei' ipsum bonum, 
quod fuit Humanae Ipsius Essentiae cum facta Divina; prior status fuit humiliationis Domini, hic autem glorificationis Ipsius, de quo prius, n. 1999: [3] in statu priore, nempe humiliationis, cum adhuc 
habuit {3} apud se' humanum infirmum, adoravit Jehovam sicut alium a Se, et quidem sicut servus, nam humanum `infirmum' non aliud est respective; quare etiam in Verbo de humano illo praedicatur `servus'; 
ut apud Esaiam, 	Protegam super civitatem hanc ad servandum illam propter Me, et propter Davidem servum Meum, xxxvii 35; </p>
<p>ubi de Assyriis, in quorum castris ab angelo percussi sunt centum et 
octoginta quinque omnia; `David' pro {4} Domino Qui quia venturus, quoad humanum dicitur `servus'; quod `David' in Verbo pro Domino, videatur n. 1888: [4] apud eundem Prophetam, 	Ecce, servus Meus, cui 
innitar, electus Meus, beneplacet anima Mea, dedi spiritum Meum super illum; judicium gentibus proferet, xlii 1; </p>
<p>ubi manifeste de Domino de quo `servus et electus,' cum fuit in humano, praedicatur: 
apud eundem, 	Quis caecus, nisi servus Meus et surdus sicut angelus [Meus, quem] mittam? quis caecus sicut perfectus, et caecus sicut servus Jehovae? xlii 19; </p>
<p>ubi etiam de Domino de quo similiter 
`servus et angelus,' cum fuit in humano, praedicatur: [5] apud eandem, 	Vos testes Mei, dictum Jehovae, et servus Meus, quem elegi; propterea ut sciatis et credatis Mihi, et intelligatis, quod Ego Ipse, 
xliii 10: </p>
<p>apud eundem, 	Dixit Jehovah formator meus ab utero in servum sibi, ad reducendum Jacobum ad Ipsum, et Israel Ipsi congregetur:... et dixit, Leve est {5}, ut sis Mihi servus ad erigendum 
tribus Jacobi,... dedi te in lucem gentium, ad esse salutem Meam usque ad extremitatem terrae, xlix 5, 6; </p>
<p>ubi etiam manifeste de Domino, ac de humano Ipsius, antequam factus `lux gentium,' et `salus 
ad extremitatem terrae '{6}: `apud eundem, 	Quis inter vos timens Jehovae, audiens vocem servi Ipsius, qui ambulat in tenebris, et non splendor ei? confidat in nomine Jehovae, et innitatur Deo suo,

<p>`servus' etiam pro humano apud Dominum, in quo cum fuit et docuit viam veritatis, est `vox servi Jehovae': [6] apud eundem, 	Vadens coram vobis Jehovah, et colligens vos Deus Israelis, ecce prudenter 
aget servus Meus, (x)extolletur et exaltabitur et evehetur valde, lii 12, 13; </p>
<p>quod de Domino cum fuit in humano praedicetur `servus,' constat nam de illo dicitur, quod `extolletur, exaltabitur

iniquitates eorum Ipse portavit, liii 2, 3, 10, 11; </p>
<p>ubi aperte, sicut in toto hoc capite {7} agitur de statu humiliationis Domini; quod tunc in infirmo humano, etiam dicitur, nempe quo `vir dolorum,
