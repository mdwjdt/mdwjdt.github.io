<h3 align="center" class="ired">属天的奥秘 第6183节</h3>
<h4 align="center"></h4><p><strong>6183.</strong>“你要带我出埃及”表以便有一个从记忆知识当中的提升。这从“带我”和“埃及”的含义清楚可知“带我”是指提升，因为当人们从埃及到迦南地时，就说他们“上”，由此表示一种提升（参看<a href="3084.htm">3084</a>，<a href="4539.htm">4539</a>，<a href="4969.htm">4969</a>，<a href="5406.htm">5406</a>，<a href="5817.htm">5817</a>，<a href="6007.htm">6007</a>节），“带某人出埃及”所表相同；“埃及”是指记忆知识，如前所述。必须简要说一说什么叫从记忆知识当中提升。属世层的重生通过属灵生命从主经由内在人逐渐灌输到居于属世层的记忆知识实现。这种灌输就是本章所论述的主题。不过，一旦这个人重生至此，并且是那种能进一步重生的人，那么他就从外层属世层被提升至内层属世层，而内层属世层在内在人的直接掌控之下。但是，如果他不是这种人，那么他的属灵生命便在外层属世层中。这种提升通过从感官印象和记忆知识当中退出，因而通过提升在它们之上而实现；然后此人便进入内层思维和情感的状态，因而从内在被提入天堂。达到这种状态的人便处于内在教会，而那些只达到第一个状态的人则处于外在教会。后者由“雅各”来代表，而前者则由“以色列”来代表。因此，为使“雅各”能成为“以色列”，因而使作为“以色列”的他能由此代表存在于内层属世层，因而存在于内在属灵教会中的属灵良善，雅各才说了这些话。</p>

And thou shalt carry me out of Egypt. That this signifies that there may be elevation out of memory-knowledges, is evident from the signification of "carrying me," as being elevation; for "going up" 
is said of passing from Egypt to the land of Canaan, whereby is signified elevation (see n. 3084, 4539, 4969, 5406, 5817, 6007), and the same by "carrying there out of Egypt;" and from the signification 
of "Egypt," as being memory-knowledges (of which above). What elevation from memory-knowledges is, shall be briefly stated. The regeneration of the natural is effected by means of the insinuation by 
the Lord of spiritual life through the internal man into the memory-knowledges in the natural. This insinuation has been treated of in this chapter. But if when the man has been regenerated thus far, 
he is of such a character that he can be further regenerated, he is elevated thence to the interior natural, which is under the immediate auspices of the internal; whereas if the man is not of such 
a character, in this case his spiritual life is in the exterior natural. The elevation is effected by a withdrawing from things of sense and memory-knowledge, thus by elevation above them, and then the 
man comes into a state of interior thought and affection, thus interiorly into heaven. They who are in this latter state are in the internal church; but they who are in the former state are in the external 
church, and are represented by Jacob, whereas they who are in the latter state are represented by Israel. To the end therefore that "Jacob" may be "Israel," and thus by him as "Israel" may be 
represented the spiritual good which is in the interior natural, thus the internal spiritual church, these words were said by Jacob. </p>

'And you are to carry me out of Egypt' means so that there may be a raising up from factual knowledge. This is clear from the meaning of 'carrying me' as a raising up (for when people pass from Egypt 
to the land of Canaan they are said 'to go up ,which means a raising up, <a href="3084.htm">3084</a>, <a href="4539.htm">4539</a>, <a href="4969.htm">4969</a>, <a href="5406.htm">5406</a>, <a href="5817.htm">5817</a>, <a href="6007.htm">6007</a>; and the same is meant by 'carrying someone there out of Egypt'); and from the meaning of 'Egypt' 
as factual knowledge, dealt with already. A brief statement must be made to explain what a raising up from factual knowledge is. The regeneration of the natural is effected by an instilling of 
spiritual life from the Lord through the internal man into the known facts residing in the natural(this instilling has been the subject in the present chapter). But once a person has been regenerated 
thus far, and if he is the kind whose regeneration can go further, he is raised up from the exterior to the interior natural, which is subject to the direct control of the internal man. But if he is not 
that kind of person, his spiritual life exists in the exterior natural. The raising up is effected by a withdrawal from sensory impressions and factual knowledge and so by a raising up above them, 
and then the person comes into a state of interior thought and affection; thus interiorly he is raised into heaven. People who attain this state are in the internal Church, whereas those who attain only 
the first state are in the external Church. The latter are represented by 'Jacob', the former by 'Israel'. It was therefore so that Jacob might be Israel, and so that spiritual good present in the 
interior natural - thus the internal spiritual Church - may thereby be represented by him as Israel, that these words were uttered by Jacob. </p>

</p><b>6183.</b>
`Et feras me ex Aegypto':  quod significet ut sit elevatio ex scientificis, constat ex significatione `ferre me' quod sit elevatio, nam ab Aegypto ad terram Canaan dicitur `ascendere' per quod significatur 
elevatio, n. 3084, 4539, 4969, 5406, 5817, 6007, ita per `ferre illuc ex Aegypto'; et ex significatione `Aegypti' quod sint scientifica, de qua prius.  Quid sit elevatio a scientificis, paucis 
dicendum est; regeneratio naturalis fit per insinuationem vitae spiritualis a Domino per internum hominem in scientifica ibi; de hac insinuatione actum est in hoc capite; at cum homo ita regeneratus 
est, si talis est, ut (x)ulterius regenerari possit, elevatur inde ad interius naturale quod sub auspicio immediato interni est; at si homo non talis est, tunc vita ejus spiritualis est in exteriore naturali; 
elevatio fit per abductionem a sensualibus et scientificis, ita per elevationem supra illa, et tunc homo in statum interioris cogitationis et affectionis pervenit, ita interius in caelum; qui 
in hoc statu sunt, in Ecclesia interna sunt, at qui in priore statu, in Ecclesia externa, et hi repraesentantur per `Jacobum' at illi per `Israelem'; ut itaque Jacob sit Israel et sic per illum ut Israelem 
repraesentetur bonum spirituale quod est in interiore naturali, ita Ecclesia spiritualis interna, haec dicta sunt. </p>
