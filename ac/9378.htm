<h3 align="center" class="ired">属天的奥秘 第9378节</h3>
<h4 align="center"></h4><p><strong>9378.</strong>“惟独摩西可以走近耶和华”表通过总体上的圣言所实现的主在百姓当中的结合和同在。这从“走近”和“摩西”的含义清楚可知：“走近”是指主在百姓当中的结合和同在，如下文所述；“摩西”是指总体上的圣言（参看<a href="9372.htm">9372</a>节）。“摩西可以走近”之所以表示通过圣言所实现的主在百姓当中的结合和同在，是因为“走近”在灵义上表示通过爱结合；那些彼此相爱的人就结合在一起，因为爱就是属灵的结合。来世的一个普遍现象是，所有人都照着对从主所获得的良善和真理的爱而结合在一起。因此，整个天堂就在于这种结合。走近主或与主结合也是这种情况。那些爱主的人就与祂结合，并且结合得如此紧密，以致当他们在天堂里时，可以说就在祂里面。所有基于信之真理过着一种良善生活的人都爱主，从而通过爱与祂结合，因为基于这些真理的良善是从主发出的，事实上就是主（约翰福音<a href="http://39-27.cn/约14.20.htm">14:20</a>，<a href="http://39-27.cn/约14.21.htm">21</a>）。<br />不过，要知道，人不能靠自己走近主并与祂结合；相反，主必走近这个人并与他结合。然而，由于主将人吸引到自己这里来（约翰福音<a href="http://39-27.cn/约6.44.htm">6:44</a>；<a href="http://39-27.cn/约12.32.htm">12:32</a>），所以表象是，这个人靠自己走近并结合。当此人停止作恶时，这种情况就会发生，因为停止作恶由人自己或自由意志决定。此时，来自主的良善正在流入；它从不缺乏，因为它存在于一个人从主那里所拥有的生命里面。但伴随这生命的良善只有在邪恶被移走的情况下才被接受。主在百姓当中的结合和同在通过圣言实现的原因是，圣言将人与天堂相联结，并通过天堂与主相联结。因为圣言是从主发出的神性真理，因此那些在教义和生活，或信和爱上持守这真理的人，就是持守从主发出的神性，从而与祂结合。由此明显可知，“惟独摩西可以走近耶和华”表示通过圣言所实现的主在百姓当中的结合和同在。<br />“走近”表示结合和同在的原因是，在来世，人与人之间的距离完全取决于属思维和情感的内层事物的差异性和多样性（<a href="1273.htm">1273</a>-<a href="1277.htm">1277</a>，<a href="1376.htm">1376</a>-<a href="1381.htm">1381</a>，<a href="9104.htm">9104</a>节）。此外，每次远离主或走近主，完全取决于从主所获得并展示给主的爱和由爱所生的信之良善。所以，每个天堂都照自己的良善亲近主；反之，每个地狱都自己的邪恶远离主。由此明显可知为何就灵义而言，“相近”和“走近或亲近”表示结合，如在下列经文中：<br />凡求告耶和华的，就是以真诚求告祂的，耶和华便与他们相近。（诗篇<a href="http://39-27.cn/诗145.18.htm">145:18</a>）<br />“相近”表示同在和结合。<br />你所拣选、使他亲近的，这人有福了！你必住在你的院中。（诗篇<a href="http://39-27.cn/诗65.4.htm">65:4</a>）<br />“亲近”表示结合。<br /><br />耶和华啊，求你亲近我的灵魂，救赎我！（诗篇<a href="http://39-27.cn/诗69.18.htm">69:18</a>）<br /><br />耶和华跟心里破碎的人相近。（诗篇<a href="http://39-27.cn/诗34.18.htm">34:18</a>）<br />耶利米书：<br />他们必使我的百姓听我的话，又使他们回头离开恶道和他们所行的恶。我岂为近处的神呢？不也为远处的神吗？（耶利米书<a href="http://39-27.cn/耶23.22.htm">23:22</a>，<a href="http://39-27.cn/耶23.23.htm">23</a>）<br />显然，“近处的神”是指着那些停止作恶的人来说的，而“远处的神”是指着那些沉浸于邪恶的人来说的。摩西五经：<br />摩西对亚伦说，这就是耶和华所说的，我在亲近我的人中要显为圣。（利未记<a href="http://39-27.cn/利10.3.htm">10:3</a>）<br />“在亲近的人中显为圣”表示在那些通过源于圣言的爱之良善和信之真理而与主结合的人当中。耶利米书：<br />他们的显贵者必是他们自己中间的一个，掌权的必从他们中间而出。我要使祂走近我，祂也要走近我；不然，谁心里能担保亲近我呢？（耶利米书<a href="http://39-27.cn/耶30.21.htm">30:21</a>）<br />这论及主，主是那“显贵者”和“掌权的”；“走近耶和华”是指与祂合一，因为神性走近神性无非是合一。</p>

<p align="center"><b>Potts(1905-1910) 9378</b></p><p><b>9378.</b>
And Moses, he alone, shall come near unto Jehovah. That this signifies the conjunction and presence of the Lord through the Word in general, is evident from the signification of "coming near," as being 
the conjunction and presence of the Lord (of which in what follows); and from the representation of Moses, as being the Word in general (see n. 9372). That by "Moses shall come near," is signified 
the conjunction and presence of the Lord through the Word, is because in the spiritual sense "to come near" signifies to be conjoined through love; for they who love each other are conjoined, because 
love is spiritual conjunction. It is a universal thing in the other life that all are conjoined according to the love of good and truth from the Lord; consequently the whole heaven is such conjunction. 
The case is similar with coming near to, or being conjoined with, the Lord. They who love Him are conjoined with Him, insomuch that they may be said to be in Him when they are in heaven; and all those 
love the Lord, consequently are conjoined with Him through love, who are in the good of life from the truths of faith; because the good from these truths is from the Lord; nay, is the Lord (John 14:20, 
21). [2] But be it known that of himself a man cannot come near to the Lord and be conjoined with Him; but the Lord will come near to the man and be conjoined with him. And because the Lord draws 
man to Himself (John 6:44; 12:32), it appears as if man of himself comes near and conjoins himself. This takes place when the man desists from evils, for to desist from evils has been left to man's 
will; that is, to his freedom. There then flows in good from the Lord, which is never wanting, for it is in the very life which man has from the Lord; but good together with life is received only insofar 
as evils have been removed. That the conjunction and presence of the Lord is through the Word, is because the Word is the union of man with heaven, and through heaven with the Lord; for the Word is 
Divine truth proceeding from the Lord. Wherefore they who are in this truth in respect to doctrine and life (that is, in respect to faith and love) are in the Divine proceeding from the Lord, thus are 
conjoined with Him. From this it is plain that by "Moses, he alone, shall come near unto Jehovah," is signified the conjunction and presence of the Lord through the Word. [3] That "coming near" denotes 
conjunction and presence, is because in the other life the distances of one from another are altogether according to the dissimilitudes and diversities of the interior things that belong to the 
thought and affection (n. 1273-1277, 1376-1381, 9104). Moreover, withdrawals from the Lord, and approaches to Him, are precisely according to the good of love and the derivative faith from Him and to 
Him. For this reason the heavens are near to the Lord according to goods; and on the other hand the hells are remote from the Lord according to evils. From this it is evident why in the spiritual sense 
"to be near" and "to approach" denote to be conjoined; as also in the following passages: </p>
<p>     Jehovah is nigh unto all them that call upon Him, that call upon Him in truth (Ps. 145:18); </p>
<p>"to be nigh" 
denotes to be present and conjoined. Again: </p>
<p>     Blessed is he whom Thou choosest, and causest to approach; he shall dwell in Thy courts (Ps. 65:4); </p>
<p>"to approach" denotes to be conjoined. [4] Again: </p>
<p> 
    O Jehovah, draw nigh unto my soul; deliver me (Ps. 69:18).      Jehovah is nigh to the broken in heart (Ps. 34:18).      Let them cause My people to hear My words, and turn them from their 
evil way, and from the wickedness of their works. Am I a God nearby, and not a God afar off? (Jer. 23:22, 23). That God is said to be "nearby" those who desist from evils, and to be "afar off" from 
those who are in evils, is manifest. In Moses: </p>
<p>      Moses said unto Aaron, This Is that which Jehovah spoke, saying, I will be sanctified in those who are near Me (Lev. 10:3); </p>
<p>"to be sanctified in 
those who are near" denotes among those who are conjoined with the Lord through the good of love and truth of faith from the Word. In Jeremiah: </p>
<p>     Then his Magnificent One shall be from him, and 
his Ruler shall go forth from the midst of him, and I will cause him to approach, and he shall approach unto Me; for who Is he that hath pledged his heart to approach unto Me? (Jer. 30:21); </p>
<p>speaking 
of the Lord, who is the "Magnificent One," and the "Ruler;" "to approach unto Jehovah" denotes to be united, for the approach of the Divine to the Divine is nothing else than union. </p>

'And Moses alone shall come near Jehovah' means the Lord's togetherness with and presence among people achieved through the Word in general. This is clear from the meaning of 'coming near' as the Lord's 
togetherness with and presence among people, dealt with below; and from the representation of 'Moses' as the Word in general, dealt with above in <a href="9372.htm">9372</a>. The reason why 'Moses shall come near' means 
the Lord's togetherness with and presence among people achieved through the Word is that 'coming near' in the spiritual sense means being joined together through love; for those who love each other are 
joined together, love being spiritual togetherness. It is universally so in the next life that all are joined together according to their love of goodness and truth received from the Lord. Consequently 
the whole of heaven consists in such togetherness. The situation is similar with coming near or being joined to the Lord. Those who love the Lord are joined to Him, so intimately that they are said 
to be 'in Him' when they are in heaven. And all those people love the Lord, and are consequently joined to Him through their love, who lead a good life based on the truths of faith, since the good 
based on those truths emanates from the Lord, indeed is the Lord, <a href="http://bible.gospelcom.net/cgi-bin/bible?passage=John%2014:20,%2021&amp;version=ESV&amp;interface=print&amp;showfn=yes&amp;showxref">John 14:20, 21</a>.  </p>
<p></p>
<p><b>[2]</b>
 But it should be recognized that a person is unable of himself to come near the Lord and be joined to Him; rather 
the Lord has to come near the person and be joined to him. Yet since the Lord draws a person towards Himself, <a href="http://bible.gospelcom.net/cgi-bin/bible?passage=John%206:44;%2012:32&amp;version=ESV&amp;interface=print&amp;showfn=yes&amp;showxref">John 6:44; 12:32</a>, the appearance is that the person does of himself come near and join 
himself. This happens when the person refrains from evils, for refraining from evils is left to a person's own decision or free will. At this time good from the Lord is flowing in; and it is never lacking, 
for it is present within the very life a person has from the Lord. But the good accompanying that life is received only in the measure that evils have been removed. The reason why the Word is the 
means by which the Lord's togetherness with and presence among people is achieved is that the Word unites a person to heaven and through heaven to the Lord. For the Word is Divine Truth emanating from 
the Lord, and therefore those who adhere to that truth in doctrine and life, or in faith and love, adhere to what is Divine emanating from the Lord, and in so doing are joined to Him.  </p>
<p></p>
<p><b>[3]</b>
 From 
all this it is evident that 'Moses alone shall come near Jehovah' means the Lord's togetherness with and presence among people achieved through the Word. The reason why 'coming near' means togetherness 
and presence is that in the next life distances between one person and another are determined altogether by the dissimilarity and diversity of the interior things which belong to thought and affection, 
see <a href="1273.htm">1273</a>-<a href="1277.htm">1277</a>, <a href="1376.htm">1376</a>-<a href="1381.htm">1381</a>, <a href="9104.htm">9104</a>. Also every moving away from the Lord or coming near Him is determined altogether by the good of love and consequently of faith received from Him and shown towards 
Him. So it is that every heaven's nearness to the Lord is determined by its good and conversely every hell's remoteness from Him by its evil. From all this it is evident why it is that 'being near' and 
'coming near' in the spiritual sense mean being joined together, as also in the following places: In David,  </p>
<blockquote>
Jehovah is near to all calling on Him, who call on Him in truth. <a href="http://bible.gospelcom.net/cgi-bin/bible?passage=Ps%20145:18&amp;version=ESV&amp;interface=print&amp;showfn=yes&amp;showxref">Ps 145:18</a>.  
</blockquote>
<p>'Near' 
stands for present and joined together with. In the same author,  </p>
<blockquote>
Blessed is [anyone] whom You choose and cause to come near; he will dwell in Your courts. <a href="http://bible.gospelcom.net/cgi-bin/bible?passage=Ps%2065:4&amp;version=ESV&amp;interface=print&amp;showfn=yes&amp;showxref">Ps 65:4</a>.  
</blockquote>
<p>'Causing to come near' stands 
for being joined together with.  </p>
<p></p>
<p><b>[4]</b>
 In the same author,  </p>
<blockquote>
O Jehovah, come near my soul; deliver me. <a href="http://bible.gospelcom.net/cgi-bin/bible?passage=Ps%2069:18&amp;version=ESV&amp;interface=print&amp;showfn=yes&amp;showxref">Ps 69:18</a>.  
</blockquote>
<p>In the same author,  </p>
<blockquote>
Jehovah is near to those broken in heart. <a href="http://bible.gospelcom.net/cgi-bin/bible?passage=Ps%2034:18&amp;version=ESV&amp;interface=print&amp;showfn=yes&amp;showxref">Ps 34:18</a>. 
</blockquote>
<p>In Jeremiah,  </p>
<blockquote>
Let them cause My people to hear My words, and let them bring them back from their evil way, from the wickedness of their deeds. Am I a God near at hand, and not a God afar off? 
<a href="http://bible.gospelcom.net/cgi-bin/bible?passage=Jer%2023:22,%2023&amp;version=ESV&amp;interface=print&amp;showfn=yes&amp;showxref">Jer 23:22, 23</a>.  
</blockquote>
<p>The words 'a God near at hand' apply, it is evident, to those who refrain from evils, and the words 'a God afar off' to those who are immersed in evils. In Moses,  </p>
<blockquote>
Moses said 
to Aaron, This is what Jehovah spoke, In those who are near Me<A name="fntext1"></a><A href="#fn1"><sup>a</sup></a> I will be sanctified. <a href="http://bible.gospelcom.net/cgi-bin/bible?passage=Lev%2010:3&amp;version=ESV&amp;interface=print&amp;showfn=yes&amp;showxref">Lev 10:3</a>.  
</blockquote>
<p>'Being sanctified in those who are near' means with those who have been joined to the Lord through 
the good of love and the truth of faith derived from the Word. In Jeremiah,  </p>
<blockquote>
At that time their Magnificent One will be one of themselves, and their Ruler will come from their midst; and I will cause 
Him to come near, and He will come near Me. For who is This [who] has pledged His heart to come near Me? <a href="http://bible.gospelcom.net/cgi-bin/bible?passage=Jer%2030:21&amp;version=ESV&amp;interface=print&amp;showfn=yes&amp;showxref">Jer 30:21</a>.  
</blockquote>
<p>This refers to the Lord, who is 'the Magnificent One' and 'the Ruler'. 'Coming 
near Jehovah' is being united to Him, for the coming near of [Him who is] Divine to Divine [Being Itself] is nothing other than union.

`Et appropinquabit Moscheh solus ille ad Jehovam': quod significet conjunctionem et praesentiam Domini per Verbum in communi, constat ex significatione `appropinquare' quod sit conjunctio et praesentia 
Domini, de qua sequitur, et ex repraesentatione `Moschis' quod sit Verbum in communi, de qua supra n. 9372. Quod per `appropinquabit Moscheh' significetur conjunctio et praesentia Domini per Verbum, 
est quia `appropinquare' in spirituali sensu significat conjungi per amorem, nam qui se mutuo amant conjunguntur, amor enim est conjunctio spiritualis; {1}universale est in altera vita, {2}quod omnes 
conjungantur secundum amorem boni et veri a Domino; inde totum caelum est talis conjunctio; similiter se habet cum appropinquatione seu conjunctione cum Domino; qui Ipsum amant, illi conjunguntur Ipsi, 
usque adeo ut dicantur esse in Ipso, cum in caelo; et omnes illi amant Dominum, proinde per amorem Ipsi conjunguntur, qui in bono vitae ex veris fidei sunt, quoniam bonum ex illis veris est a Domino, 
immo est Dominus, Joh. xiv 20, 21 Ast sciendum quod homo ex se non possit appropinquare ad 2 Dominum et conjungi Ipsi, sed Dominus appropinquabit ad hominem et conjungetur illi; et quia {3}Dominus 
trahit hominem ad Se, (m)Joh. vi 44, xii 32,(n) apparet sicut homo ex se appropinquet {4}et se conjungat; hoc fit quando homo desistit a malis, nam desistere a {5}malis hominis arbitrio seu libero 
relictum est; influit tunc bonum a Domino, quod nusquam deest, inest enim ipsi vitae quae homini a Domino; sed cum vita tantum {6}boni recipitur, quantum remota sunt mala. {7}(m)Quod per Verbum sit conjunctio 
et praesentia Domini, est quia Verbum {8}est unio hominis cum caelo et per caelum cum Domino; Verbum enim est Divinum Verum procedens a Domino, quare qui quoad doctrinam et vitam, seu quoad fidem
