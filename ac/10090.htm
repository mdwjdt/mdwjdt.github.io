<h3 align="center" class="ired">属天的奥秘 第10090节</h3>
<h4 align="center"></h4><p><strong>10090</strong>.“这就可以作你的分”表传给那些处于神之真理的人。这从摩西的代表和“作分”的含义清楚可知：要拥有胸作分的摩西是指神性真理方面的主，因而是指来自主的神性真理（参看<a href="6752.htm">6752</a>，<a href="7010.htm">7010</a>，<a href="7014.htm">7014</a>，<a href="9372.htm">9372</a>节）；“作分”是指传给，因为要赐给摩西、亚伦和百姓的这些祭牲部位表示神圣的神性之物在他们那里的传给。一切传给都照着接受者的品质，因而照着那些接受之人当中的代表的品质发生。<br />之所以胸归摩西为分，稍后论及的胁归亚伦，是因为此处所论述的主题是天堂和教会中来自主的神性真理和神性良善的传给，以及他们将这真理和良善变成自己的。有两样事物在那里被接受，即神性真理和神性良善，这二者皆来自主；神性真理被那些在主的属灵国度的人接受，神性良善被那些在属天国度的人接受（参看<a href="9277.htm">9277</a>，<a href="9684.htm">9684</a>节所提到的地方）。这解释了为何胸归摩西作为分，胁则归了亚伦，因为“胸”表示主的属灵国度中的神性真理（<a href="10087.htm">10087</a>节），而“胁”表示属天国度中的神性良善（<a href="10075.htm">10075</a>节）；“筐内的饼”也是，它们同样归了亚伦（参看<a href="10077.htm">10077</a>节）。<br />如刚才所示，摩西代表神性真理方面的主；并且当被祝圣以承接祭司职分时，亚伦代表神性良善的主（<a href="9806.htm">9806</a>节）。胸归摩西为他的分，这一点明显可见于利未记，那里也论述了亚伦和他儿子承接祭司职分：<br />摩西从充满手的公绵羊那里拿胸作为摇祭，在耶和华面前摇一摇；它归摩西的分，是照耶和华所吩咐摩西的。（利未记<a href="http://39-27.cn/利8.29.htm">8:29</a>）</p>

And it shall be to thee for a portion. That this signifies communication with those who are in truths Divine, is evident from the representation of Moses, who was to have the breast for a portion, as 
being the Lord as to Divine truth, thus the Divine truth which is from the Lord (see n. 6752, 7010, 7014, 9372); and from the signification of being "for a portion," as being communication; for that 
which was given from the sacrifices to Moses, to Aaron, his sons, and the people, signified the communication of the holy Divine with them; and all communication is effected according to the quality of 
him who receives, thus according to the quality of the representation with those who received.  [2] The breast was given to Moses for a portion, and the hind quarter to Aaron (of which below), because 
the subject here treated of is the communication and appropriation of Divine truth and Divine good from the Lord in heaven and in the church; and there are two things which are received there, namely, 
Divine truth and Divine good, both from the Lord; Divine truth by those who are in the Lord's spiritual kingdom, and Divine good by those who are in the celestial kingdom (see the places cited in 
n. 9277, 9684). Therefore the breast was given to Moses for a portion, and the hind quarter to Aaron, for by the "breast" is signified Divine truth in the Lord's spiritual kingdom (n. 10087), and by 
the "hind quarter," Divine good in the celestial kingdom (n. 10075); as also by the "breads in the basket," which likewise were given to Aaron (see n. 10077). 10077). [3] That Moses represented the Lord 
as to Divine truth, has been shown above; and that Aaron when inaugurated into the priesthood represented the Lord as to Divine good (n. 9806). That the breast was granted to Moses for a portion is 
evident in Leviticus, where also the inauguration of Aaron and his sons into the priesthood is treated of: </p>
<p>     Moses took the breast, and waved it a wave-offering before Jehovah, of the ram of fillings, 
and it was to Moses for a portion, as Jehovah commanded Moses (Lev. 8:29). </p>

<p align="center"><b>Elliott(1983-1999) 10090</b></p><p><b>10090.</b>
'And it shall be the portion for you' means transmission to those who are governed by God's truths. This is clear from the representation of Moses, whose portion the breast was to be, as the Lord in 
respect of Divine Truth, thus Divine Truth which comes from the Lord, dealt with in <a href="6752.htm">6752</a>, <a href="7010.htm">7010</a>, <a href="7014.htm">7014</a>, <a href="9372.htm">9372</a>; and from the meaning of 'being the portion for' as transmission, since those parts of sacrifices 
that were given to Moses, Aaron, his sons, and the people were signs of the transmission of what was Divine and holy with them. And all transmission takes place in accord with the character of the 
recipient, thus in accord with the character of the representation among those who were the recipients.  </p>
<p></p>
<p><b>[2]</b>
 The reason why the breast was apportioned to Moses and the flank, spoken of a little further 
on, to Aaron was that the subject at present is the transmission of Divine Truth and Divine Good from the Lord in heaven and in the Church, and their making that Truth and Good their own. These 
two - Divine Truth and Divine Good, both of which come from the Lord - are what are received there, Divine Truth by those in the Lord's spiritual kingdom and Divine Good by those in the celestial kingdom, 
see the places referred to in <a href="9277.htm">9277</a>, <a href="9684.htm">9684</a>. This explains why the breast was apportioned to Moses and the flank to Aaron, for 'the breast' means Divine Truth in the Lord's spiritual kingdom, <a href="10087.htm">10087</a>, 
while 'the flank' means Divine Good in the celestial kingdom, <a href="10075.htm">10075</a>, as also does 'the bread in the basket', which too was assigned to Aaron, <a href="10077.htm">10077</a>. </p>
<p></p>
<p><b>[3]</b>
 As was shown just above, Moses represented 
the Lord in respect of Divine Truth; and Aaron, when consecrated to the priesthood, represented the Lord in respect of Divine Good, see <a href="9806.htm">9806</a>. The fact that the breast was assigned to Moses as his portion 
is clear in Leviticus, where again the consecration of Aaron and his sons to the priesthood is the subject,  </p>
<p>Moses took the breast and waved it as a wave offering before Jehovah, from the ram 
of fillings [of the hand]; and it was Moses' portion, as Jehovah had commanded Moses. <a href="http://bible.gospelcom.net/cgi-bin/bible?passage=Lev%208:29&amp;version=ESV&amp;interface=print&amp;showfn=yes&amp;showxref">Lev 8:29</a>.  </p>

`Et erit tibi in portionem': quod significet communicationem cum illis qui in veris Divinis, constat ex repraesentatione Moschis, cui pectus esset in portionem, quod sit Dominus quoad Divinum Verum, 
ita Divinum Verum quod a Domino, de qua n. 6752, (t)7010, 7014 , 9372, et ex significatione `esse in portionem' quod sit communicatio, nam quae Moschi, Aharoni, filiis ejus, et populo dabantur ex sacrificiis, 
significabant communicationem sancti Divini cum illis; et omnis communicatio fit secundum quale ejus qui recipit, ita secundum quale repraesentationis apud illos qui recipiebant; quod pectus 
Moschi datum fuerit in portionem, et armus Aharoni, de quo sequitur, erat causa quia hic agitur de communicatione ac de appropriatione Divini Veri et Divini Boni a Domino in caelo et in Ecclesia; ac 
duo sunt quae recipiuntur ibi, nempe Divinum Verum et Divinum Bonum, utrumque a Domino, Divinum Verum ab illis qui in regno spirituali Domini sunt, ac Divinum Bonum ab illis qui in regno caelesti, videantur 
citata n. 9277, 9684, ideo pectus dabatur Moschi in portionem, et armus Aharoni, per `pectus' enim significatur Divinum Verum in regno spirituali Domini, n. 10,087, et per `armum' Divinum Bonum 
in regno caelesti, n. 10,075, et quoque per `panes in corbe', qui etiam cesserunt Aharoni, n. 10,077. 	[3] Quod Moscheh repraesentaverit Dominum quoad Divinum Verum, supra ostensum est, et quod Aharon 
cum inauguratus est in sacerdotium, repraesentaverit Dominum quoad Divinum Bonum, videatur n. 9806. Quod Moschi cesserit pectus in portionem, constat in Levitico, ubi etiam {1} agitur de inauguratione 
Aharonis et filiorum ejus in sacerdotium, 		Moscheh sumpsit pectus, et agitavit illud agitationem coram Jehovah, de ariete impletionum, et fuit Moschi in portionem, quemadmodum praecepit Jehovah 
Moschi, viii 29. @1 After sacerdotium$ </p>
