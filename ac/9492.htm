<h3 align="center" class="ired">属天的奥秘 第9492节</h3>
<h4 align="center"></h4><p><strong>9492.</strong>“四围镶上金边”表固定良善的边界，免得他们被邪恶靠近和伤害。这从“边”和“金”的含义清楚可知：“边”是指固定的边界，如下文所述；“金”是指良善，如刚才所述（<a href="9490.htm">9490</a>节）。之所以说“免得他们被邪恶靠近和伤害”，是因为从主发出的良善保护那些在天堂里的人，免得他们被源于地狱的邪恶靠近和伤害。因为地狱不断呼出邪恶，或说执意做坏事，试图摧毁天堂（<a href="8295.htm">8295</a>节）；这解释了为何他们看似某种正在沸腾和冒泡的东西（<a href="8209.htm">8209</a>节）。因为反对邻舍的仇敌和反对神的仇恨牢牢固定在那些地狱里的人的心智中；正因如此，当意识到正直之人的幸福时，他们就充满愤怒（<a href="1974.htm">1974</a>节）。但从主发出、包围作为一个整体的天堂，以及具体的一切天堂社群和每位个体居民的良善会保护他们，抵御攻击；并且它也不断如此行。有一个努力作恶、毁坏的气场不断从地狱发出；一个努力行善、保护的气场不断从主发出（参看<a href="8209.htm">8209</a>节）。柜子“四围的金边”就表示良善的这种边界，主用它来保护天堂。</p>

<p align="center"><b>Potts(1905-1910) 9492</b></p><p><b>9492.</b>
And shalt make upon it a border of gold round about. That this signifies a fixing of the bounds by good, lest they be approached and injured by evils, is evident from the signification of "a border," 
as being a fixing of the bounds (of which in what follows); and from the signification of "gold," as being good (of which just above, n. 9490). It is said "lest they be approached and injured by evils," 
because the good that proceeds from the Lord protects those who are in heaven, lest they be approached and injured by evils from hell. For the hells continually breathe evil, and endeavor to destroy 
heaven (n. 8295); whence there appears there as it were an effervescence, and as it were a boiling up (n. 8209). For in the minds of those who are in the hells is seated hatred against the neighbor 
and hatred against God; and therefore they are infuriated when they perceive the bliss of the upright (n. 1974). But the good that proceeds from the Lord, which encompasses heaven in general, and the 
heavenly societies and individual angels there in particular, protects, and represses the assaults, and this continually. (That a sphere of endeavors to do evil and to destroy is perpetual from the hells; 
and a sphere of endeavors to do good and to protect is perpetual from the Lord, see n. 8209.) This bounding good, by which the Lord protects heaven, is signified by "the border of gold round about 
the ark." </p>

<p align="center"><b>Elliott(1983-1999) 9492</b></p><p><b>9492.</b>
'And you shall make on it a rim of gold round about' means a border of good, serving to defend them from the approach of evils and the harm these can do. This is clear from the meaning of 'a rim' as 
a border, dealt with below; and from the meaning of 'gold' as good, dealt with just above in <a href="9490.htm">9490</a>. The reason why to defend them from the approach of evils and the harm these can do is meant is that the 
good emanating from the Lord serves to protect those in heaven from being approached and harmed by evils that spring from hell. For unceasingly the hells are bent on doing ill and try to destroy heaven, <a href="8295.htm">8295</a>, which accounts for their looking like something that is boiling up and bubbling over, <a href="8209.htm">8209</a>. For firmly lodged in the minds of those who are in hell there is hatred of the neighbour and hatred 
of God; and because of this they are filled with rage when they become aware of the bliss of those who are upright, <a href="1974.htm">1974</a>. But the good emanating from the Lord which surrounds heaven as a whole, also 
every heavenly community and each individual inhabitant specifically, protects them and wards off attacks; and it does so unceasingly. Regarding 'the sphere of endeavours' emanating constantly from 
the hells to do ill and to destroy, and 'the sphere of endeavours' emanating constantly from the Lord to do good and to protect, see <a href="8209.htm">8209</a>. That border of good with which the Lord protects heaven is meant 
by the rim of gold round about the ark.  </p>

</p><b>9492.</b>
`Et facies super illam limbum auri circumcirca': quod significet terminationem ex bono ne adeantur et laedantur a malis, constat ex significatione `limbi' quod sit terminatio, de qua sequitur, et ex 
significatione `auri' quod sit bonum, de qua mox supra n. 9490; quod sit ne adeantur et laedantur a malis, est quia bonum procedens a Domino tutatur illos qui in caelo ne adeantur et laedantur a malis 
quae ex inferno; inferna enim continue spirant malum et conantur destruere caelum, n. 8295, unde apparet ibi sicut effervescentia, {1}et sicut ebullitio, n. 8209; insidet enim animis illorum qui in 
infernis, odium contra proximum, et odium contra Deum, {2}quapropter in furorem veniunt cum percipiunt beatitudinem proborum, n. 1974; sed bonum procedens a Domino, quod circumdat caelum in communi, (c)ac 
societates caelestes et singulos ibi in particulari, tutatur, et reprimit insultus, et hoc continue; quod sphaera conatuum faciendi malum et destruendi sit perpetua ab infernis, et sphaera conatuum 
faciendi bonum et tutandi sit perpetua a Domino, videatur n. 8209; bonum illud terminans quo Dominus tutatur caelum, significatur per `limbum ex auro circumcirca arcam.' @1 in infernis, et etiam ebullitio
