<h3 align="center" class="ired">属天的奥秘 第5394节</h3>
<h4 align="center"></h4><p><strong>5394.</strong>那些既残忍又奸淫的人，在来世最喜欢的就是污秽和粪便。对他们来说，这些东西发出的臭味是最甜蜜、最令他们快乐的；他们喜欢这种气味胜过其它一切快乐，因为这些事物是相对应的。这些地狱部分在臀部之下，部分在右脚之下，部分在前面的深处。这些是经过直肠的路径所通向的地狱。有一次，一个灵人被带到那里，并由此向我说话。他说那里除了茅厕外什么东西也看不到。那个地方的人和他说话，把他带到各种茅厕，那里的茅厕有很多。此后，他被带到向左一点的另一个地方；当在那个地方时，他说一股极其可怕的恶臭从那里的洞穴散发出来；他连一只脚也无法挪动，差点掉进一个洞穴。那些洞穴还发出死尸的臭味。原因在于，那里的灵人都很残忍、诡诈；死尸的臭味最令他们快乐。等到以后论述地狱，尤其排泄物和尸体的地狱时，我们再描述这些灵人。</p>

They who have been cruel and adulterers, in the other life love nothing so well as filth and excrements, the stenches from such things being most sweet and delightful to them, and being preferred by 
them to all other delights. The reason is that these things correspond. These hells are partly under the buttocks, partly under the right foot, and partly deep down in front. These are the hells into 
which the way by the rectum intestine leads. A certain spirit being conveyed thither, and speaking with me therefrom, said that nothing but privies were to be seen there. They who were in the place spoke 
to him, and led him to various privies, which were very numerous there. He was afterward led to another place a little to the left; and when he was there, he said that a most dreadful stench exhaled 
from the caverns there, and that he could not stir a step without almost falling into some cavern. A cadaverous stench also was exhaled from the caverns, and the reason was that they who were there 
were cruel and deceitful, to whom a cadaverous stench is most delightful. But these will be described in the following pages, when I come to speak of the hells, and specifically of the excremental and 
cadaverous hells. </p>

People who have been both cruel and adulterous like nothing more in the next life than filth and excrement. To them the stink of these is most sweet and pleasant, and they prefer such odours to all other 
delights. The reason why lies in their correspondence. Those hells lie partly beneath the buttocks, partly beneath the right foot, and partly in a frontal direction, deep down. These are the hells 
to which the path through the rectum leads. Once a certain spirit was brought there, from where he spoke to me. He said there was nothing else in sight but latrines. Those there talked to him and led 
him to various other latrines, which were very numerous there. After that he was taken to another place situated a little to the left, and while he was in that place he said that an absolutely dreadful 
stench was emanating from caverns there and that he could not move a foot without almost falling into a cavern. The stink of dead bodies was also emanating from the caverns. The reason for this was 
that cruel and deceitful spirits were there, to whom the stink of dead bodies is most delightful. But these spirits are to be dealt with later on when the hells, especially the excrementitious and dead-body 
hells, will be the subject. </p>

Qui crudeles et adulteri fuerunt, in altera vita nihil plus amant quam sordes et excrementa; fetores ex talibus (t)sunt illis suavissimi et jucundissimi, ac illos {1} praeferunt omnibus jucundis; causa 
est quia correspondent; inferna illa sunt partim sub natibus, partim sub pede dextro, et partim antrorsum profunde; illa sunt in quae ducit via per intestinum rectum.  Quidam illuc translatus, et 
inde mecum locutus; dicebat quod ibi solum latrinae appareant; loquebantur cum illo qui ibi, et ducebant ad {2} varias latrinas quae ibi perplures; postea ducebatur ad alium locum paulo ad sinistrum, 
et cum ibi esset, dicebat quod nidor teterrimus ex cavernis ibi exhalaret, et quod non movere pedem posset quin paene in aliquam cavernam decidat; ex cavernis etiam fetor cadaverosus exhalatus est; causa 
erat quia crudeles et dolosi erant qui ibi, quibus {3} cadaverosus fetor est jucundissimus.  Sed de his in sequentibus agendum, ubi {4} de infernis, et in specie de infernis excrementitiis et cadaverosis. </p>
