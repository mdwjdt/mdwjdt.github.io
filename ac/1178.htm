<h3 align="center" class="ired">属天的奥秘 第1178节</h3>
<h4 align="center"></h4><p><strong>1178.</strong>“他在耶和华面前是个猎取的勇士”表他说服了很多人。这从脱离仁之信所具有的性质，以及圣言中“猎取”的含义清楚可知。脱离仁之信具有这样的性质：即人们很容易被说服。绝大多数人不知何为内在事物，只知道何为外在事物。绝大多数人耽于声色、低级趣味和欲望，只关心自己和这个世界，因此很容易被这类宗教信仰所迷惑。从“猎取”的含义来看：在圣言中，“猎取”一般表说服；尤表通过迎合感官、低级趣味、欲望，并随着自己和他人的性子任意解读教义，为的是提升自己的地位和财富，因而通过说服来迷惑人们的心智。<br />这一点明显可见于以西结书：<br />这些妇女有祸了！她们给我的手腕缝制各种带子，给高矮之人作头巾，为要猎取性命（灵魂）。难道你们要猎取我百姓的性命（灵魂），为利己将性命（灵魂）救活吗？你们为几把大麦、几块饼，在我民中亵渎我，对肯听谎言的民说谎，杀死不该死的性命（灵魂），救活不该活的性命（灵魂）。看哪！我要与你们的带子作对，就是你们用以猎取性命（灵魂）、使他们飞走的，我要将它们从你们的膀臂上扯去，释放性命（灵魂），就是你们猎取飞走的性命（灵魂），我也必撕裂你们的头巾，救我百姓脱离你们的手，不再被猎取，落在你们手中。（以西结书<a href="http://39-27.cn/结13.18.htm">13:18</a>-<a href="http://39-27.cn/结13.21.htm">21</a>） 这几节经文解释了“猎取”的含义，即通过说服，还通过他们为了利己，同时随着别人的性子滥用和解读认知进行迷惑欺骗。<br />弥迦书：<br />地上虔诚人灭尽，人间没有正直人；各人埋伏要杀人流血；都用网罗猎取弟兄，他们用双手作恶，不去行善，君王徇情面，审判官要贿赂，位分大的吐出恶意，彼此勾结。（弥迦书<a href="http://39-27.cn/弥7.2.htm">7:2</a>-<a href="http://39-27.cn/弥7.3.htm">3</a>）<br />此处同样解释了“猎取”的含义，就是为了自己“埋伏”，或称假为真，口吐恶意，曲解，从而说服。诗篇：<br />摇唇鼓舌的人在地上必坚立不住；祸患必猎取强暴的人，将他打倒。（诗篇<a href="http://39-27.cn/诗140.11.htm">140:11</a>）<br />这论及为了欺骗用谎言劝诱、思想恶毒、说话刻意讨好的恶人；“舌”在此表谎言。</p>

<p><strong>[NCE]1178.</strong> The meaning of he was mighty in hunting before the face of Jehovah as the fact that he persuaded many people can be seen from the fact that faith divided from charity has this ability, and from the symbolism of hunting in the Word.<br />Faith separated from neighborly love is such that people are easily talked into it. The majority of humankind has no idea what internal phenomena are, only what outer ones are. Most people live lives of physical sensation, animal pleasures, and cravings and focus on themselves and the material world. As a result they are easily ensnared by this religion.<br />As for the symbolism of hunting, its general meaning in the Word is persuading people. Its specific meaning is captivating their minds and in this way persuading them, by appealing to their physical senses, sensual pleasures, and cravings, and by arbitrarily interpreting doctrine to agree with the viewpoint of both listener and speaker, for the selfish purpose of obtaining high rank and great wealth.{*1} [2] This symbolism can be seen in Ezekiel:<br />Doom to those who sew padding together [to go] over all the joints of my arms and who make mantles [to go] over heads of every height, to hunt souls.{*2} You hunt the souls that belong to my people; and the souls that are yours you keep alive. And you profaned me among my people for handfuls of barleycorns and for crumbs of bread, to kill souls that must not die and to keep souls alive that must not live, lying about yourselves to my people, who were listening to the lie. Look now, regarding your padding, with which you are hunting souls, there, to [make them] fly away: I will rip it off your arms and release the souls that you are hunting, souls [that you are hunting] to [make them] fly away. And I will rip up your mantles and rescue my people from your hand, and they will no longer be in your hand for hunting. (<a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_1178/bible_king-james-version_ezekiel_13_18-19" target=_top>Ezekiel 13:18-19</a>, <a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_1178/bible_king-james-version_ezekiel_13_20-21" target=_top>20-21</a>)<br />This explains what hunting is: it is deceiving a person with persuasive arguments and with religious concepts that we pervert, interpreting them to advance our own interests and to harmonize with the other person's mindset.<br />[3] In Micah:<br />The merciful person has perished off the earth, and there is no upright person among humankind; they all lie in wait for blood. Each man hunts his brother with a net, while they do evil with their hands in place of doing good. Chieftains are conducting inquiries and passing judgment for the sake of a bribe, and the great are uttering the perversity of their soul; and they twist it. (<a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_1178/bible_king-james-version_micah_7_2-3" target=_top>Micah 7:2-3</a>)<br />This passage also explains what hunting is: it is conniving for selfish purposes, or in other words, saying that falsity is truth, and speaking perversity, and twisting things, all for the sake of persuading others. In David:<br />A man with a tongue{*3} must not become established on the earth. A man of violence hunts evil to the point of [the earth's] ruination. (<a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_1178/bible_king-james-version_psalms_140_11" target=_top>Psalms 140:11</a>)<br />This is about godless people who, for the purpose of deceiving others, persuade them with false arguments, think wrongly, and speak smoothly. The tongue stands for dishonesty.<br /><br /><strong>Footnotes:</strong><br />{*1} On the connection between physical pursuits and high rank and wealth, see note 1 in <a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_1178/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_977" target=_top>977</a>. [Editors]<br />{*2} The padding was sewn together to form amulets worn for magical protection, and presumably the mantles or veils mentioned here served a similar purpose. There is an implied connection with witchcraft, a practice condemned in the terse utterance of <a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_1178/bible_king-james-version_exodus_22_18" target=_top>Exodus 22:18</a>: "You shall not suffer a witch to live." [RS, SS]<br />{*3} A "man with a tongue" (אִישׁ‭ ‬לָשׁוֹן ['îš lāšôn]) is a liar. [LHC] </p>

He was mighty in hunting before Jehovah. That this signifies that he persuaded many, is evident from its being so with faith separated from charity; and also from the signification of "hunting" in the 
Word. Faith separated from charity is of such a nature that men are easily persuaded. The greater part of mankind do not know what internal things are, but only external things; and most men abide in 
things of sense, in pleasures and in cupidities, and have in view themselves and the world; and therefore they are easily captivated by such a religion. From the signification of "hunting:" in the Word 
"hunting" signifies in general persuading; specifically, captivating the minds of men by favoring their sensuous inclinations, pleasures, and cupidities, by using doctrinals which they explain at 
their own pleasure in accordance with their temper and that of the other, and with a view to their own self-exaltation and enrichment, thus by persuading.  [2] As is made evident in Ezekiel: </p>
<p>     Woe 
to them that sew cushions upon all the joints of My hands, and that make veils upon the head, of every stature, to hunt souls. Do ye hunt souls for My people, and make souls alive for yourselves? And 
ye have profaned Me among My people for handfuls of barley and for pieces of bread, to slay the souls that should not die, and to make the souls alive that should not live, by your lying to My people 
that listen unto a lie. Behold, I am against your cushions wherewith ye there hunt souls to make them fly, and I will tear them from your arms, and I will let the souls go, the souls that ye hunt to 
make them fly, and your veils also will I tear, and deliver My people out of your hand, and they shall be no more in your hand, to be hunted (Ezek. 13:18-21). What is meant by "hunting" is here explained, 
that it is captivating by persuasions, and by knowledges which they pervert, and interpret in favor of themselves, and in accommodation to the temper of another.  [3] In Micah: </p>
<p>     The merciful 
man is perished out of the earth, and there is none upright among man; they all lie in wait for bloods; they hunt every man his brother with a net, when they do evil with the hands instead of doing 
good, the prince asketh and judgeth for the sake of reward, and the great man, he uttereth the perversity of his soul, and they wrest it (Micah 7:2-3). Here likewise what is meant by "hunting" is explained, 
that it is to lie in wait for the sake of self, or to call the false true, and utter perversity, and distort, and thereby to persuade. In David: </p>
<p>     A man of tongue shall not be established 
in the earth; evil shall hunt the violent man to overthrow him (Ps. 140:11). This is said of the wicked who persuade by means of falsities, think evilly and talk blandly for the purpose of deceiving; 
"tongue" here denotes falsehood. </p>

'He was mighty in hunting before Jehovah' means that he persuaded many people. This is clear from the fact that faith separated from charity is such, and also from the meaning of 'hunting' in the Word. 
Faith separated from charity is such that people are easily persuaded. The vast majority of mankind do not know what internal things are, but they do know what external are. The vast majority are also 
given to sensualism, low pleasures and desires, considering only themselves and the world, and are therefore easily captivated by that kind of religion. From the meaning of 'hunting': in the Word 
'hunting' means in general persuading and in particular captivating people's minds, by pandering to the senses, low pleasures and desires, and by the use of matters of doctrine which in an arbitrary fashion 
they explain in a way that satisfies their own disposition and that of the other person. They do this for the selfish reason that they may be important in position and in wealth, and so by the 
use of persuasion. </p>

<p><b>[2]</b>
 This is clear in Ezekiel, </p>
<blockquote>
Woe to those who sew little pillows on all the joints of My hands and make veils upon the head [of persons] of every stature to hunt souls! You hunt 
souls for My people, and you keep souls alive for yourselves; and you have desecrated Me among My people for handfuls of barley and for crusts of bread, to slay souls that will not die, and to keep 
alive souls that will not live, by lying to My people that listen to lies. behold, I am against your little pillows with which you there hunt the souls to make them fly away, and I will tear them from 
on your arms, and I will let the souls go that you hunt, souls to fly away; and I will tear off your veils and deliver My people out of your hand, and they will be no more in your hand to be hunted.

</blockquote>
<p>These verses explain what 'hunting' means - a deceiving by means of persuasions and by means of cognitions which they pervert and explain to their own advantage, and at the same time 
according to the other person's disposition. </p>
<p></p>
<p><b>[3]</b>
 In Micah, </p>
<blockquote>
The compassionate man has perished from the earth, and there is none upright among men. They all lie in wait for blood;<A name="fntext1"></a><A href="#fn1"><sup>a</sup></a> they hunt 
every man his brother with a net. When they do evil with the hands instead of doing good, the prince asks for and gives judgement for the sake of a reward, and the great man utters the perversity of his 
soul; and they twist it around. <a href="http://bible.gospelcom.net/cgi-bin/bible?passage=Micah%207:2,%203&amp;version=ESV&amp;interface=print&amp;showfn=yes&amp;showxref">Micah 7:2, 3</a>. 
</blockquote>
<p>This in a similar way explains what 'hunting' means, namely lying in wait for the sake of self, that is, calling true that which is false, uttering 
perversity, and twisting things around, and in these ways persuading. In David, </p>
<blockquote>
A slanderer<A name="fntext2"></a><A href="#fn2"><sup>b</sup></a> will not be established in the land; as for the violent man, evil hunts him down, to overthrow him! <a href="http://bible.gospelcom.net/cgi-bin/bible?passage=Ps%20140:11&amp;version=ESV&amp;interface=print&amp;showfn=yes&amp;showxref">Ps 140:11</a>. 
</blockquote>
<p>This refers to wicked persons who persuade by means of falsities, think wickedly, and speak smoothly, with deceitful intent. 'Tongue' here stands for lying.

Quod 'is fuit potens venatione coram Jehovah' significet quod multis persuaserit, constat ex fide separata a charitate quod talis; tum a significatione 'venari' in Verbo:  fides separata a charitate 
talis est quod facile persuadeantur; plurima pars hominum non sciunt quid sunt interna, sed quid externa; et plurima pars in sensualibus, voluptatibus et cupiditatibus degunt, et se ac mundum spectant, 
ideo facile captantur a tali religione.  A significatione venari; in Verbo 'venari' significat in genere persuadere, in specie captare animos adblandiendo eorum sensualibus, voluptatibus et cupiditatibus, 
utendo doctrinalibus quae explicant secundum genium suum et alterius ex arbitrio, ex causa sui ut magni sint honore et opulentia, ita persuadendo; [2]ut constat apud Ezechielem, Vae consuentibus 
pulvillos super omnibus axillis manuum Mearum, et facientibus velamina super caput omnis staturae ad venandum animas.  Animas venamini populo Meo, et animas vobis vivificatis?  et (x)profanastis Me 
in populo Meo pro pugillis hordeorum, et pro frustis panis, ad occidendum animas, quae non morientur, et ad vivificandum animas, quae non vivent, mentiendo vos populo Meo, audientibus mendacium.... 
 Ecce Ego quoad pulvillos vestros, quibus vos venantes ibi animas ad evolandum, et abrumpam eos desuper brachiis vestris, et dimittam animas, quas vos venantes, animas ad evolandum, et disrumpam velamina 
vestra, et eripiam populum Meum e manu vestra, et non erunt amplius in manu vestra in venationem, xiii 18-21; </p>
<p>hic explicatur quid 'venari,' quod sit decipere per persuasiones, et per cognitiones 
quas pervertunt quasque in favorem sui, et secundum genium alterius, explicant:  [3]apud Micham,  Periit misericors e terra, et rectus inter hominem nullus; omnes ii sanguinibus insidiantur; vir fratrem 
suum venantur reti, quando malum faciunt volis pro benefaciendo, princeps interrogans et judicans propter retributionem, et magnus est loquens perversitatem animae suae is, et torquent eam, vii 2, 
3; </p>
<p>hic similiter explicatur quid 'venari,' quod insidiari sui causa, seu falsum dicere verum, et loqui perversitatem et torquere, sic persuadendo:  apud Davidem,  Vir linguae, non firmabitur in terra, 
vir violentiae malum venatur ei in subversiones, Ps. cxl 12 [A.V. 11]; </p>
<p>ibi de impiis qui per falsa persuadent, male cogitant, blande loquuntur, fallendi causa; 'lingua' ibi pro mendacio. </p>
