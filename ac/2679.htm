<h3 align="center" class="ired">属天的奥秘 第2679节</h3>
<h4 align="center"></h4><p><strong>2679.</strong>“夏甲就走了，在别是巴的旷野飘荡”表那时在信的教义上从一个地方游荡到另一个地方的状态。这从“走了，在旷野飘荡”和“别是巴”的含义清楚可知：“走了，在旷野飘荡”是指从一个地方游荡到另一个地方的状态；“别是巴”是指信之教义，如本章末尾所述，那里说到，亚伯拉罕和亚比米勒在别是巴立了约（32节），亚伯拉罕在别是巴种植果园（33节）。本节描述了那些正被改造之人一开始的状态是何性质，也就是说，他们被带入各种歧途。因为主要让他们多多思考永生，从而多多思考信之真理；不过，他们出于自我去思考，如前所述，故只能四处游荡，无论是在教义方面还是在生活方面。他们抓住从小就灌输给他们的东西，或别人给他们留下的深刻印象，或他们自己想出来的东西当作真理，完全没有想到，他们正被自己没有意识到的各种情感所误导。这些人就像尚未成熟的果实，它的形状、美丽和味道不是在一瞬间被催生出来的。他们又像嫩叶，无法在一瞬间开花抽穗。然而，那时所进入的观念尽管绝大部分是错的，但仍是有助于促进成长的那类；后来，当这些人经历改造时，这类错误观念部分被分离出去，部分有助于赋予营养，可以说是融入后续生命的汁液。这些汁液反过来部分适合主随后植入良善与真理，部分作为终级层面而服务于属灵之物。因此，它们不断充当改造的手段，这些手段在一个连续的链条和次序中不断继续下去。因为人所具有的一切事物，甚至最细微的东西都是主所预见的，并且是主为他将来持续到永远的状态所提供的。只要有可能，并且此人允许自己被主引导，这一切都会为了他的好处而成就。</p>

And she went and wandered in the wilderness of Beersheba. That this signifies a state of wandering at that time in the doctrinal things of faith, is evident from the signification of "going and wandering 
in the wilderness," as being a wandering state; and from the signification of "Beersheba," as being the doctrine of faith (treated of at the end of this chapter, where it is said that Abraham and 
Abimelech made a covenant in Beersheba, verse 32; and that Abraham planted a grove in Beersheba, verse 33). In this verse is described what the quality of the state of those who are reformed is in the 
beginning, namely, that they are carried away into various wanderings; for it is given them by the Lord to think much about eternal life, and thus much about the truths of faith; but because from what 
is their own (as just stated) they cannot do otherwise than wander hither and thither, both in doctrine and in life, seizing as truth that which has been inseminated from their infancy, or is impressed 
upon them by others, or is thought out by themselves-besides their being led away by various affections of which they are not conscious-they are like fruits as yet unripe, on which shape, beauty, 
and savor cannot be induced in a moment; or like tender blades which cannot in a moment grow up into bloom and ear. But the things which enter in at that time, though for the most part erroneous, are 
still such as are serviceable for promoting growth; and afterwards, when the men are being reformed, these are partly separated, and are partly conducive to introducing nourishment and as it were juices 
into the subsequent life-which again can afterwards be partly adapted to the implanting of goods and truths by the Lord, and partly to being serviceable to spiritual things as ultimate planes; and 
thus as continual means to reformation, which means follow on in perpetual connection and order; for all things even the least with man are foreseen by the Lord, and are provided for his future state 
to eternity; and this for his good insofar as is in any wise possible, and as he suffers himself to be led by the Lord. </p>

'And she went and wandered in the wilderness of Beersheba' means a state of wandering from one position to another in matters of doctrine regarding faith. This is clear from the meaning of 'going and 
wandering in the wilderness' as a state of wandering from one position to another, and from the meaning of 'Beersheba' as the doctrine of faith, dealt with at the end of this chapter, where it is said 
that Abraham and Abimelech made a covenant in Beersheba, verse 32, and Abraham planted a grove in Beersheba, verse 33. The present verse describes the nature of the state to begin with of those who 
are being reformed, that is to say, it is a state when they are carried away into various errors. For they are given by the Lord to think much about eternal life, and so to think much about the truths 
of faith; but because they do so from the proprium, as has been stated, they cannot do other than wander into this position and then into that both in doctrine and in life. Thus they hold to that as 
being the truth which has been instilled into them since early childhood, or which is impressed on them by others, or which they think out for themselves, quite apart from the consideration that various 
affections of which they are not aware exist to mislead them. These people are like fruit as yet unripe, to which shape, beauty, and flavour cannot be given in an instant, or like tender blades of 
corn which are unable to flower or to grow ears in an instant. The ideas however which enter in at that time, even though they are for the most part erroneous, are nevertheless such as may serve to promote 
growth; and later on when those persons are being reformed, such erroneous ideas are partly separated, and partly are of use in imparting so to speak nourishment and juices to the life that follows. 
These in turn can be adapted partly to the implantation subsequently of goods and truths by the Lord, and partly to serving as the ultimate planes for spiritual things. Thus they serve continuously 
as means to reformation, which means follow consecutively in an unbroken chain and order. For every least thing with man is foreseen by the Lord and is provided by Him for his future state which continues 
for ever. This is done for his own good, to the extent that this is in any way possible and the person allows himself to be led by the Lord. </p>

`Et ivit et erravit in deserto Beersheba': quod significet statum erraticum tunc in doctrinalibus fidei, constat (c)a significatione `ire et errare in deserto' quod sit status erraticus; et a significatione 
`Beersheba' quod sit doctrinalia fidei, de qua ad finem hujus capitis, ubi dicitur quod Abrahamus et Abimelechus percusserunt foedus in Beersheba, vers. 32: et quod Abrahamus plantavit lucum 
in Beersheba, vers. 33. In hoc versu describitur qualis in principio {1} est status eorum qui reformantur {2}, nempe quod in varios errores auferantur; inditur enim (c)iis a Domino ut multum cogitent 
de vita aeterna, ita multum de veris fidei, sed quia ex proprio, ut dictum, non possunt aliter quam sicut doctrina ita vita errore huc {3} illuc, arripiendo pro vero quod inseminatum est ab infantia, 
vel quod imprimitur illis ab aliis, vel quod cogitatur ab ipsis, praeter quod affectiones variae quas nesciunt, abducant; sunt sicut fructus (o)adhuc immaturi, quibus non momento forma, pulchritudo, et 
sapor induci queunt; aut sicut surculi teneri, qui non momento excrescere possunt in florem aut spicam: quae autem tunc intrant, tametsi quoad plurimam partem erronea, usque sunt talia quae inserviant 
promovendae crescentiae, quae dein cum reformantur, partim separantur, partim conducunt pro inducendis quasi alimentis et {4} succis in vitam sequentem, partim quae coaptari possunt bonis et veris 
postmodum a Domino implantandis, et partim ut inserviant spiritualibus pro ultimis planis; ita pro continuis mediis ad reformationem, quae media in perpetuo nexu et ordine {5} consequuntur, nam omnium 
minima apud hominem a Domino praevidentur, et ad futurum, ejus statum in aeternum providentur, et hoc ad ejus bonum, quantam usquam possibile est, et homo patitur se a Domino duci. 	@1 After eorum.$ 	@2
