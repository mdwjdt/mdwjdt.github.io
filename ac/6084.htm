<h3 align="center" class="ired">属天的奥秘 第6084节</h3>
<h4 align="center"></h4><p><strong>6084.</strong>“只管叫你父亲和你弟兄住在最好的地上”表使它们能生活在这些，即记忆知识的至内在部分。这从“最好的地”和“住”的含义，以及以色列和他儿子们的代表清楚可知：“最好的地”是指记忆知识所在的属世心智的至内在部分，如下文所述，因为“埃及地”是指属世心智，如刚才所述（<a href="6083.htm">6083</a>节）；“住”是指生活（<a href="1293.htm">1293</a>，<a href="3384.htm">3384</a>，<a href="3613.htm">3613</a>，<a href="4451.htm">4451</a>，<a href="6051.htm">6051</a>节）；以色列和他的儿子们，即此处要住在这里的“父亲和弟兄”，是指来自属世层的属灵良善和那里的教会真理（参看<a href="6082.htm">6082</a>节）。“最好的”表示至内在部分，因为最好的直接在人的注视之下。眼睛总是盯着它感觉最有情感、最快乐的东西；直接在注视之下的东西也是至内在部分，因为它在中心，因而在眼前存在于最强烈的光中。而其它东西则在周围的边缘位置，因而不怎么清晰，直到在边缘变得模糊，因为它所激发的快乐和情感较少。这就是记忆知识在内视面前的情形，内视的对象无非是记忆知识和真理。存在于这些对象中的快乐和良善就是那将视线引向它们的。然而，要知道，在那些以属灵和属天真理为快乐，并感受对它们的一种情感之人当中，与这些真理相一致的真理和记忆知识直接在它的注视之下，也就是说，它们住在至内在部分，因为对他们来说，这些真理是最好的东西。但在那些对属于爱自己爱世界的邪恶感受到一种情感，并以之为快乐的人当中，与这些虚假相一致的虚假和记忆知识直接在内视的注视之下，也就是说，它们住在至内在部分。也可参看前面所述（<a href="6068.htm">6068</a>节）。</p>

In the best of the land make thy father and thy brethren dwell. That this signifies that they shall live in the inmost of these, namely, of memory-knowledges, is evident from the signification of the 
"best of the land," as being the inmost of the natural mind where memory-knowledges are (of which in what follows, for the "land of Egypt" is this mind; as just above, n. 6083); from the signification 
of "dwelling," as being to live (n. 1293, 3384, 3613, 4451, 6051); and from the representation of Israel and his sons, who are here the "father and brethren" who shall live therein, as being spiritual 
good from the natural and the truths of the church there (see above, n. 6082). [2] That the "best" denotes the inmost is because that is the best which is kept directly in view; for the eye is ever 
directed to that which most affects and delights; and that which is kept directly in view is also the inmost, because it is in the center, and is therefore before the eyes in the strongest light; while 
other things are round about in the circumference, and are therefore less clear, and at last obscure, because they do not delight and affect so much. This is the case with memory-knowledges before 
the internal sight, the objects of this sight being no other than memory-knowledges and truths. That which is delightful and good in the objects is what directs the sight toward them. But be it known 
that truths and the memory-knowledges which agree with them come directly under the view (that is, are in the inmost) with those who are delighted and affected with spiritual and celestial truths, for 
to them these truths are the best things; but falsities and the memory-knowledges which agree with them come directly under the view (that is, are in the inmost) with those whom the evils of love of 
self and of the world affect and delight. (See also what has been said above, n. 6068.) </p>

'In the best of the land cause your father and your brothers to dwell' means that they may live in the inmost part of it, that is to say, of factual knowledge. This is clear from the meaning of 'the 
best of the land' as the inmost part of the natural mind where factual knowledge resides, dealt with below, for 'the land of Egypt' is the natural mind, as immediately above in <a href="6083.htm">6083</a>; from the meaning 
of 'dwelling' as living, dealt with in <a href="1293.htm">1293</a>, <a href="3384.htm">3384</a>, <a href="3613.htm">3613</a>, <a href="4451.htm">4451</a>, <a href="6051.htm">6051</a>; and from the representation of Israel and his sons, to whom 'father' and 'brothers' who are to live there refer here, as spiritual 
good from the natural and the truths of the Church there, dealt with above in <a href="6082.htm">6082</a>. </p>
<p></p>
<p><b>[2]</b>
 'The best' means the inmost part since the best is that which is kept immediately beneath one's gaze. The eye 
is always directed towards that for which it feels the greatest affection and delight; and that which is kept immediately beneath its gaze is also the inmost part because it is in the centre and as a 
consequence exists before the eyes in greatest light. All else lies round about in peripheral positions and as a consequence is less clear, till at the edges it is obscure because it arouses less delight 
and affection. This is the situation with factual knowledge beheld by inward sight. The objects of that sight are nothing else than known facts and truths. The delight and goodness present in those 
objects are what direct that sight towards them. It should be recognized however that truths and factual knowledge agreeing with those truths come directly under its gaze, that is, they reside in the 
inmost part, if people take a delight in and feel an affection for spiritual and celestial truths since they are for those people 'the best'. But falsities and factual knowledge agreeing with those 
falsities come directly under the gaze of inner sight, that is, they reside in the inmost part, if people feel an affection for and take delight in the evils that belong to self-love and love of the 
world. See also what has been stated in <a href="6068.htm">6068</a>. </p>

</p><b>6084.</b>
`In optimo terrae habitare fac patrem tuum et fratres tuos':  quod significet quod in intimo eorum, nempe scientificorum, vivant, constat ex significatione `optimi terrae' quod sit intimum mentis naturalis 
ubi scientifica, de qua sequitur; `terra Aegypti' enim est mens illa, ut mox supra n. 6083; ex significatione `habitare' quod sit vivere, de qua n. 1293, 3384, 3613, 4451, 6051; et ex repraesentatione 
`Israelis et filiorum ejus' qui hic `pater et fratres qui ibi vivent', quod sint bonum spirituale e naturali et vera Ecclesiae ibi, de qua supra n. 6082. [2]Quod `optimum' sit intimum, est quia 
id optimum est quod directe tenetur sub visu; oculus semper dirigitur ad id quod maxime afficit et delectat, et quod directe sub illo tenetur, id quoque est intimum quia est in centro, et inde coram 
(x)oculis in maxima luce, cetera circumcirca sunt in peripheriis, et inde minus clara et tandem obscura, quia non ita delectant et afficiunt; ita se habet cum scientificis coram visu interno; objecta 
hujus visus non alia sunt quam scientifica et vera; jucundum et bonum in objectis sunt quae dirigunt illuc visum; ast sciendum quod vera et eis concordantia scientifica directe sub visum veniant, hoc 
est, in intimo sint apud illos quos vera spiritualia et caelestia delectant et afficiunt, nam haec illis `optima' sunt; at falsa, et illis concordantia scientifica, directe sub visum veniunt, hoc est, 
in intimo sunt apud illos quos mala amoris sui et mundi afficiunt et delectant; videantur etiam quae n. 6068 dicta sunt. </p>
