<h3 align="center" class="ired">属天的奥秘 第732节</h3>
<h4 align="center"></h4><p><strong>732.</strong>创世记7:5 挪亚就遵着耶和华所吩咐他的行了。<br />这和前面一样，表示事就这样发生了。在前一章22节，经上两次提到挪亚“行”了，而此处只提到一次，并且那里用的是“神”这个名，而此处用的是“耶和华”。原因在于，前一章阐述的是觉知之物，而此处阐述的是意愿之物。觉知之物将意愿之物视为与自己不同和分离之物，而意愿之物则将觉知之物视为与其结合之物，或如同一体，因为觉知来自意愿。因此，那里两次提到他“行”了，而此处只提了一次，并且那里用的是“神”这个名，而此处用的是“耶和华”。</p>

<p><strong>[NCE]732.</strong> <a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_732/bible_king-james-version_genesis_7_5" target=_top>Genesis 7:5</a>. And Noah did everything that Jehovah had commanded him once again means it happened in this way.<br />See <a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_732/bible_king-james-version_genesis_6_22" target=_top>Genesis 6:22</a>, which twice says that "Noah did;" this verse says it only once. And <a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_732/bible_king-james-version_genesis_6_22" target=_top>Genesis 6:22</a> uses the name God where this verse uses Jehovah. The reason is that the passage there dealt with matters of the intellect while this one deals with matters of the will. Matters of intellect regard matters of will as different and separate from themselves, but matters of will view matters of intellect as united to themselves, or as being one with themselves. The ability to understand, you see, rises from the will. This is why the previous chapter uses the word did twice where the present one uses it just once, and why the previous chapter uses the name God where the present one uses Jehovah. </p>
<p align="center"><b>Potts(1905-1910) 732</b></p><p><b>732.</b>
Verse 5. And Noah did according to all that Jehovah commanded him. This signifies as before, that thus it came to pass. Compare the preceding chapter, verse 22, where it is said twice that Noah "did" 
here only once; and there the name "God" is used, but here "Jehovah." The reason is that there things of the understanding are treated of, and here those of the will. Things of the understanding regard 
those of the will as being different and distinct from themselves; but things of the will regard those of the understanding as being united, or as one, with them; for the understanding is from the 
will. This is the reason why it is there twice said he "did" and here only once; and also why the name "God" is used, and here "Jehovah." </p>

<p align="center"><b>Elliott(1983-1999) 732</b></p><p><b>732.</b>
Verse 5 And Noah did according to all that Jehovah commanded him means, as previously, that it was so accomplished.  </p>
<p>See the previous chapter, <a href="http://bible.gospelcom.net/cgi-bin/bible?passage=at%206:22&amp;version=ESV&amp;interface=print&amp;showfn=yes&amp;showxref">at 6:22</a>, where it is said twice of Noah that he 'did', 
whereas in this verse it is said only once. In that verse the name 'God' is used, but in this 'Jehovah'. The reason is that the previous chapter deals with things of the understanding, the present with 
those of the will. Things of the understanding view those of the will as things different and separate from themselves, but those of the will view those of the understanding as things united to themselves 
or as a unity, for the understanding has its being from the will. This is why the verb 'to do' is used twice in 6:22 but only once at this point, and also why the name 'God' is used there but 
'Jehovah' here. </p>

</p><b>732.</b>
Vers. 5.  Et fecit Noah secundum omne, quod praecepit ei Jehovah, significat ut prius quod ita factum. 	Videatur cap. praeced. vers. 22, ubi bis dicitur quod 'Noahus fecerit,' hic modo semel; et ibi 
'Deus,' hic autem 'Jehovah.' Causa est quia ibi agitur de intellectualibus, hic de voluntariis; intellectualia spectant voluntaria sicut alia et distincta a se, sed voluntaria spectant intellectualia 
sicut unita sibi, aut sicut unum, nam a voluntate intellectus; quae causa est quod ibi bis 'facere' dicatur, hic modo semel; tum quod ibi Deus, hic autem Jehovah. </p>
