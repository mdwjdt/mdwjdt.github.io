<h4 align="center"></h4><p><strong>308.</strong>至于“东边”和“伊甸园”的象征义，前面已作过解释，此处不再赘述。对于“基路伯”表主的命定，以防止人凭自我的感官和知识了解信的奥秘，因而亵渎之，毁灭自己，这从圣经提及“基路伯”的各个段落可知。<br />鉴于犹太人的秉性，他们若清楚知道主要降临，知道教会的礼仪是象征主，知道人死后依然活着，知道人有内在、圣经有内义，他们必要亵渎之，因而永远灭亡。法柜施恩座上的“基路伯”，会幕门帘和幔子上的“基路伯”，圣殿内的“基路伯”，都是象征主的保守（出埃及记<a href="http://39-27.cn/出25.18.htm">25:18</a>-<a href="http://39-27.cn/出25.21.htm">21</a>，<a href="http://39-27.cn/出26.1.htm">26:1</a>，<a href="http://39-27.cn/出26.31.htm">31</a>；列王记上<a href="http://39-27.cn/王上6.23.htm">6:23</a>-<a href="http://39-27.cn/王上6.29.htm">29</a>，<a href="http://39-27.cn/王上6.32.htm">32</a>）。因为放置约版的法柜和此处的生命树所表相同，皆表主及其属天之性。正因如此，主常被称为“坐在基路伯上的以色列的神”，也因如此，他从“二基路伯中间”晓谕摩西和亚伦（出埃及记<a href="http://39-27.cn/出25.22.htm">25:22</a>；民数记<a href="http://39-27.cn/民7.89.htm">7:89</a>）。<br />以西结书对此有清楚的描述：“以色列神的荣耀本在基路伯上，现今从那里升到殿的门槛。耶和华对他说，你去走遍耶路撒冷全城，那些因城中所行可憎之事叹息哀哭的人，画记号在额上。我耳中听见他其余的人说，要跟随他走遍全城，以行击杀。你们的眼不要顾惜，也不要可怜他们。要将年老的、年少的，并处女、婴孩和妇女，从圣所起全都杀尽。要污秽这殿，使院中充满被杀的人。”（以西结书<a href="http://39-27.cn/结9.3.htm">9:3</a>-<a href="http://39-27.cn/结9.7.htm">7</a>）接下来：“主对那穿细麻衣的人说，你进去，在旋转的轮内基路伯以下，从基路伯中间将火炭取满两手，撒在城上。有一个基路伯从基路伯中伸手到基路伯中间的火那里，取些放在那穿细麻衣的人两手中，那人就拿出去了。”（以西结书<a href="http://39-27.cn/结10.2.htm">10:2</a>-<a href="http://39-27.cn/结10.7.htm">7</a>）这些经文表明，“基路伯”象征主的命定，以阻止人了解信的奥秘。正因如此，他们被任凭陷入疯狂的欲望中，亦即此处“将火炭撒在城上”、“没有人被顾惜”所表之义。</p>

<p><strong>[NCE]308.</strong> The symbolism of the east and the Garden of Eden has already been demonstrated [<a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_308/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_98" target=_top>98-101</a>, <a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_308/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_107" target=_top>107-109</a>], so there is no need to dwell on them. Several passages in the Word mentioning the guardian beings, though, show that they symbolize the Lord's providence making sure we do not incur death by profaning the mysteries of faith, through an insane exploration of them that relies on our own powers, empiricism, or mere facts.<br />The Jews were such that had they clearly recognized certain realities, they would have profaned the knowledge and been destroyed forever. Those realities were that the Lord would come, that the representative or prefigurative forms in the church symbolized the Lord, that life continues after death, that we have an inner self, and that the Word has an inner meaning. The danger of their profanation was represented by the guardian beings on the appeasement cover{*1} atop the ark, on the curtains for the dwelling place, and on the veil, and by the same figures in the Temple (<a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_308/bible_king-james-version_exodus_25_18" target=_top>Exodus 25:18</a>, <a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_308/bible_king-james-version_exodus_25_19" target=_top>19</a>, <a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_308/bible_king-james-version_exodus_25_20" target=_top>20</a>, <a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_308/bible_king-james-version_exodus_25_21" target=_top>21</a>; <a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_308/bible_king-james-version_exodus_26_1" target=_top>26:1</a>, <a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_308/bible_king-james-version_exodus_26_31" target=_top>31</a>; <a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_308/bible_king-james-version_1-kings_6_23-29" target=_top>1 Kings 6:23-29</a>, <a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_308/bible_king-james-version_1-kings_6_32" target=_top>32</a>, <a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_308/bible_king-james-version_1-kings_6_35" target=_top>35</a>). They symbolized the fact that the Lord was on guard.<br />The ark holding the testimony{*2} symbolized the same thing as the tree of lives here — the Lord and the things that belong to heaven, which are exclusively the Lord's. This is why the Lord many times is called the God of Israel seated upon the guardian beings{*3} and why he talked with Aaron and Moses from between them (<a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_308/bible_king-james-version_exodus_25_22" target=_top>Exodus 25:22</a>; <a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_308/bible_king-james-version_numbers_7_89" target=_top>Numbers 7:89</a>).<br />[2] A clear picture of this appears in Ezekiel in the following words:<br />The glory of Israel's God lifted up off the guardian being on which it had been and moved to the threshold of the House. He called to the man wearing linen clothes and said to him, "Cross through the middle of the city, through the middle of Jerusalem, and make a mark on the foreheads of the men who are groaning and sighing over all the abominations done in the middle of it." And to the men themselves he said, "Cross through the city behind him and strike! Do not let your eye spare any and do not exercise compassion. Old person, young man, and young woman, and toddler, and women — kill them to annihilation. Defile the House and fill the courtyards with those who have been stabbed." (<a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_308/bible_king-james-version_ezekiel_9_3-4" target=_top>Ezekiel 9:3-4</a>, <a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_308/bible_king-james-version_ezekiel_9_5-6" target=_top>5-6</a>, <a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_308/bible_king-james-version_ezekiel_9_7" target=_top>7</a>)<br />Further on:<br />He told the man wearing linen clothes, "Go in, between the wheels, under the guardian being, and fill your palms with embers of fire from between the guardian beings and scatter them over the city." The being stretched its hand out from among the [other] beings to the fire that was among the beings, picked it up, and put it into the palms of the man wearing linen clothes. And he took it and went out. (<a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_308/bible_king-james-version_ezekiel_10_1-7" target=_top>Ezekiel 10:1-7</a>)<br />These verses show that the guardian beings symbolize the Lord's providence working to prevent people from prying into religious mysteries. They also show that for this reason people were left to their mad desires, symbolized here by the fire that was to be sprinkled over the city and by the fact that no one was to be spared.<br /><br /><strong>Footnotes:</strong><br />{*1} The traditional term for this cover is "mercy seat." Sitting on the ark that contained the two tablets inscribed with the Ten Commandments, it was topped with two gold, winged figures — the guardian beings — and was the site of God's presence with the Israelites (see <a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_308/bible_king-james-version_exodus_25_17-22" target=_top>Exodus 25:17-22</a>). The name for the item in Hebrew, כַּפֹּרֶת (kappōreṯ), comes from כִּפֶּר (kipper), a verb whose basic meaning is to cover, although it is most commonly used in the more abstract sense of "covering" transgression by atonement. The same root can be seen in the familiar Hebrew term Yom Kippur, "Day of Atonement," on which the high priest made a sin offering whose blood was spattered on the appeasement cover (see <a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_308/bible_king-james-version_leviticus_16_1-34" target=_top>Leviticus 16</a>; the role of the appeasement cover in the sacrifice is described in verses <a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_308/bible_king-james-version_genesis_3_13-15" target=_top>13-15</a> there).

Without being called God of Israel, he is said to sit on (or, in some translations, between) the guardian beings in <a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_308/bible_king-james-version_1-samuel_4_4" target=_top>1 Samuel 4:4</a>; <a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_308/bible_king-james-version_2-samuel_6_2" target=_top>2 Samuel 6:2</a>; <a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_308/bible_king-james-version_psalms_80_1" target=_top>Psalms 80:1</a>; <a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_308/bible_king-james-version_psalms_99_1" target=_top>99:1</a>.

As the signification of the "east" and of the "garden of Eden" were given above, it is needless to dwell longer on them; but that " cherubim" denote the providence of the Lord lest man should insanely 
enter into the mysteries of faith from his Own, and from what is of the senses and of memory-knowledge [sensuali et scientifico], and should thus profane them, and destroy himself, is evident from all 
the passages in the Word where mention is made of "cherubim." As the Jews were of such a quality that if they had possessed any clear knowledge concerning the Lord's coming, concerning the representatives 
or types of the church as being significative of Him, concerning the life after death, concerning the interior man and the internal sense of the Word, they would have profaned it, and would have 
perished eternally; therefore this was represented by the " cherubim" on the mercy-seat over the ark, upon the curtains of the tabernacle, upon the vail, and also in the temple; and it was signified 
that the Lord had them in keeping (Exod. 25:18-21; 26:1, 31; 1 Kings 6:23-29, 32). For the ark, in which was the testimony, signified the same as the tree of lives in this passage, namely, the Lord 
and the celestial things which belong solely to Him. Hence also the Lord is so often called the "God of Israel sitting on the cherubim" and hence He spake with Moses and Aaron "between the cherubim" (Exod. 
25:22; Num. 7:89).  This is plainly described in Ezekiel, where it is said: </p>
<p>     The glory of the God of Israel was uplifted from upon the cherub whereon He was, to the threshold of the house. 
And He called to the man clothed with linen, and said unto him, Go through the midst of the city, through the midst of Jerusalem, and set a mark upon the foreheads of the men who groan and sigh for all 
the abominations done in the midst thereof. And to the others He said, Go ye after him through the city, and smite; let not your eye spare, neither have ye pity; slay to blotting out the old man, and 
the young man, and the virgin, the infant, and the women; defile the house, and fill the courts with the slain (Ezek. 9:3-7). And again: </p>
<p>     He said to the man clothed in linen, Go in between the 
wheel to beneath the cherub, and fill thy palms with coals of fire from between the cherubim, and scatter them over the city; the cherub put forth his hand from between the cherubim unto the fire which 
was between the cherubim, and took thereof, and put it into the palms of him that was clothed in linen, who took it and went out (Ezek. 10:2, 7). From these passages it is evident that the providence 
of the Lord in preventing men from entering into the mysteries of faith is signified by the "cherubim;" and that therefore they were left to their insane cupidities, here also signified by the "fire 
that was to be scattered over the city" and that "none should be spared." </p>

What 'the east' means and what 'the garden of Eden' means has been shown already and therefore there is no need to pause over them here. But the fact that 'cherubim' means the Lord's providing against 
a person's insanely entering into mysteries of faith from the proprium, sensory evidence, and factual knowledge as the starting point, and against his profaning those mysteries, and in so doing perishing, 
becomes clear from several places in the Word where mention is made of cherubim. Because the Jews were the kind of people who, if they had had any clear knowledge about the Lord's Coming, about 
the fact that the representatives, or types, in that Church meant the Lord, about life after death, about the inner man, and if they had had any clear knowledge of the internal sense of the Word, they 
would have committed profanation and would have perished for ever; the Lord's protection against this therefore was represented by the cherubim on the Mercy Seat over the Ark, and by those on the curtains 
of the Tabernacle, and on its veil, and similarly in the Temple. And the provision of the cherubim meant the Lord's care and protection of them, <a href="http://bible.gospelcom.net/cgi-bin/bible?passage=Exod%2025:18-21;%2026:1,%2031;1&amp;version=ESV&amp;interface=print&amp;showfn=yes&amp;showxref">Exod 25:18-21; 26:1, 31;1</a> Kings 6:23-29, <a href="32.htm">32</a>, <a href="35.htm">35</a>. 
For the Ark, which contained the covenant, had the same meaning as the tree of life<A name="fntext1"></a><A href="#fn1"><sup>a</sup></a> does here, that is, the Lord and heavenly things which are altogether His. Consequently the Lord is also many times 
called 'the God of Israel seated upon the cherubim'; and it was from between the cherubim that He spoke to Aaron and Moses, Exod. 25:22; Num. 7:89.  </p>
<p></p>
<p><b>[2]</b>
 A plain description of this exists in Ezekiel 
where the following is stated,  </p>
<p>The glory of the God of Israel was raised up from above the cherub over which it had been, towards the threshold of the house. He called out to the man clothed 
in linen. And He said to him, Pass through the middle of the city, through the middle of Jerusalem, and put a mark upon the foreheads of the men who groan and sigh over all the abominations committed 
in the middle of it. And to the others He said, Pass through the city after him and smite; let not your eye spare, and show no clemency; slay outright old men, young men, virgins, little children, and 
women. Defile the house, and fill the courts with the slain.<A name="fntext2"></a><A href="#fn2"><sup>b</sup></a> Ezek. 9:3-7.   And later on,   He said to the man clothed in linen, Go into the wheel underneath the cherub, and fill the palms of your 
hands with coals of fire from between the cherubim and spread them over the city. A cherub stretched out his hand from between the cherubim to the fire that was between the cherubim, and he took [some 
of it] and put it into the palms of the man clothed in linen; and he took it and went out. Ezek. 10:1-7.   From these verses it is clear that the Lord's providence which guards against people's 
penetrating mysteries of faith is meant by 'the cherubim', and that people were therefore abandoned to their insane desires, which in this quotation are also meant by 'the fire which was spread over 
the city', and by 'nobody's being spared'.

Quid 'oriens' significat et quid 'hortus Edenis,' prius ostensum est, quare illis non immorandum: sed quod cherubi significent providentiam Domini ne homo ex proprio, sensuali et scientifico, vesane 
intret in mysteria fidei, et illa profanet, et sic pereat, ex nullis non locis in Verbo ubi cheruborum mentio fit, constare potest. Quia Judaei tales erant ut si aliquid manifeste novissent de Adventu 
Domini, de repraesentativis seu typis Ecclesiae, quod significarent Dominum, de vita post mortem, de interiore homine, et {1} sensum internum Verbi, quod profanavissent, et in aeternum periissent, quare 
repraesentatum hoc per cherubos ad propitiatorium super arca, super aulaeis habitaculi, super velo, similiter in templo, et significatum quod Dominus custodiverit, Exod. xxv 18-21; xxvi 1, 31; 1 
Reg. vi 23-{x}29, 32, 35. Nam arca, in qua testimonium, significabat idem ac hic 'arbor vitarum,' seu Dominum et caelestia quae unice sunt Domini; inde quoque Dominus multoties dicitur 'Deus Israelis 
insidens cherubis': et cum Aharone et Mose locutus est inter cherubos, Exod. xxv 22; Num. {x}vii 89. Describitur hoc manifeste apud Ezechielem ubi haec, Gloria Dei Israelis elevata est desuper cherubo, 
super quo fuerat, ad limen domus, clamavit ad virum indutum lineis,...et dixit ad illum, Transi per medium urbis, per medium Hierosolymae, et signa signum super frontes virorum gementium et suspirantium 
super omnibus abominationibus factis in medio ejus: et istis dixit,...Transite per urbem post illum, et percutite, ne parcat oculus vester, neque clementia utamini; senem, juvenem, et virginem, 
et infantem, et mulieres occidite ad deletionem;...polluite domum, et implete atria confossis, ix 3-6[7]; </p>
<p>et porro,  Dixit ad virum indutum lineis, Intra inter rotam ad subter cherub, et imple volas 
tuas prunis ignis ab inter cherubos, et sparge super urbem;...Misit cherub manum suam ab inter cherubos ad ignem, qui inter cherubos, tulit et dedit in volas induti lineis, et sumpsit et exivit, x 1-7; </p>
<p>ex 
quibus constat quod Domini providentia ne penetrarent in mysteria fidei, significetur per 'cherubos,' et quod ideo relicti sint suis vesanis cupiditatibus, quae hic quoque significantur per 'ignem 
qui spargeretur super urbem,' et quod 'nulli parceretur.' @  1 It seems that si novissent is to be understood here.$ </p>
