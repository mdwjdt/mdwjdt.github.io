<h3 align="center" class="ired">属天的奥秘 第3268节</h3>
<h4 align="center"></h4><p><strong>3268.</strong>“以实玛利的长子尼拜约，及基达、亚德别、米比衫；米施玛、度玛、玛撒；哈大、提玛、伊突、拿非施、基底玛”表构成属灵教会，尤其外邦人当中的属灵教会的一切事物。这从此处给出名字的这些人的代表清楚可知。其中有些人在圣言中，尤其在预言部分再次被提及，如尼拜约、基达、度玛、提玛。在那里，他们表示诸如构成属灵教会，尤其外邦人当中的属灵教会的那类事物。另外，这一点从他们有“十二”个的事实明显看出来，因为“十二”表示信、因而教会的一切事物，如下文所述。因此，下面16节的经文说，他们“作了他们民的十二族长”。<br />尼拜约和基达代表那些构成属灵教会，尤其外邦人当中的属灵教会的事物，也就是说，代表属灵教会的良善和源于这些良善的真理。这一点明显可见于以赛亚书：<br />成群的骆驼并米甸和以法的独峰驼必遮满你。示巴的众人都必来到，要奉上黄金乳香，又要传说耶和华的赞美。基达的羊群都必聚集到你这里，尼拜约的公羊要供你使用；在我坛上必蒙悦纳。（以赛亚书<a href="http://39-27.cn/赛60.6.htm">60:6</a>-<a href="http://39-27.cn/赛60.7.htm">7</a>）<br />就至高意义而言，这论及主，就相对意义而言，这论及祂的国度。“基达的羊群”表属灵的良善，因为“羊群”是指属灵的良善（参看<a href="343.htm">343</a>，<a href="415.htm">415</a>，<a href="2566.htm">2566</a>节）。“尼拜约的公羊”表属灵的真理，因为“公羊”是指属灵的真理（参看<a href="2833.htm">2833</a>节）。<br />“基达”是亚兰伯（Arabia或译阿拉伯），这从下面的经文明显可知。亚兰伯被称为“基达”，就是以实玛利的儿子，这从以下事实明显看出来，即：这两节所提到的名字是那些都以亚伯拉罕的儿子和孙子命名的国家或民族的名字，如米甸、以法、示巴（对此，参看2-4节经文），以及此处的基达和尼拜约。以西结书：<br />亚拉伯人和基达的一切首领都作你手下的客商，用羊羔、公绵羊、公山羊与你交易。（以西结书<a href="http://39-27.cn/结27.21.htm">27:21</a>）<br />这论及推罗，也就是那些拥有对良善与真理的认知之人，“推罗”是指这类人（参看<a href="1201.htm">1201</a>节）。“亚拉伯人”表属灵良善，“基达的首领”表属灵真理。“羊羔、公绵羊、公山羊”表属灵的良善与真理。<br />耶利米书：<br />你起来上基达去，毁灭东方人。他们的帐棚和羊群都要夺去，将幔子和一切器皿，并骆驼为自己掠去。（耶利米书<a href="http://39-27.cn/耶49.28.htm">49:28</a>-<a href="http://39-27.cn/耶49.29.htm">29</a>）<br />这论及“基地”和“东方人”所表示的属灵教会的荒废。“帐棚和羊群”表该教会的良善，“幔子和器皿”表该真理的真理。“帐棚和羊群”，以及“幔子和器皿”都表示敬拜的圣物；而敬拜的一切神圣事物全都与良善并真理有关。<br />那些因没有良善而没有真理的人由旷野中的亚拉伯人和基达人来代表（Arabians and Kedarites），如以赛亚书：<br />巴比伦必永无人居住，亚拉伯人也不在那里支搭帐棚。（以赛亚书<a href="http://39-27.cn/赛13.19.htm">13:19</a>，<a href="http://39-27.cn/赛13.20.htm">20</a>）<br />同一先知书：<br />旷野和其中的城邑，并基达人居住的村庄都当扬声。（以赛亚书<a href="http://39-27.cn/赛42.11.htm">42:11</a>）<br />耶利米书：<br />你坐在道旁等候他们，好像阿拉伯人在旷野埋伏一样。（耶利米书<a href="http://39-27.cn/耶3.2.htm">3:2</a>）<br />诗篇：<br />我寄居在米设，住在基达帐棚之中有祸了！（诗篇<a href="http://39-27.cn/诗120.5.htm">120:5</a>）<br />以赛亚书：<br />底但结伴的客旅啊，你们必在阿拉伯的森林中住宿。提玛地的居民拿水来，送给口渴的，拿饼来迎接逃亡的人。因为他们逃避刀剑和出了鞘的刀剑，并上了弦的弓与战争的激烈。主对我这样说，一年之内，照雇工的年数，基达的一切荣耀必化为乌有；弓箭手的余数，就是基达人的勇士（，必然稀少）。（以赛亚书<a href="http://39-27.cn/赛21.13.htm">21:13</a>-<a href="http://39-27.cn/赛21.17.htm">17</a>）<br />“在阿拉伯的森林中住宿”表真理方面的荒废；“底但结伴的客旅”表那些拥有认知的人（<a href="3240.htm">3240</a>，<a href="3241.htm">3241</a>节末尾）；“提玛地的居民”表那些具有简单良善的人，就是诸如善良的外邦人所具有的那种。显然，出身于以实玛利儿子的人被称为“提玛”。“基达”表那些拥有简单真理的人，论到他们，经上说“他们逃避刀剑和战争的激烈”，这表示他们不会经历试探的争战，因为他们不再处于良善。<br />耶利米书：<br />你们且过到基提海岛去察看，打发人往基达去留心查考，看曾有这样的事没有，有哪个民族换了神明，其实那些并不是神。（耶利米书<a href="http://39-27.cn/耶2.10.htm">2:10</a>-<a href="http://39-27.cn/耶2.11.htm">11</a>）<br />“基提海岛”表那些更远离敬拜的人，也就是具有简单的良善，并由此具有属世真理的外邦人（<a href="1156.htm">1156</a>，<a href="1158.htm">1158</a>节）；显然，“基达”所表相同。<br />同一先知书：<br />我就从耶和华的手中接了这杯，给耶和华所差遣我去的各民族喝；底但、提玛、布斯和一切剃周围鬓发的；亚拉伯的诸王，住旷野的西方诸王。（耶利米书<a href="http://39-27.cn/耶25.17.htm">25:17</a>，<a href="http://39-27.cn/耶25.23.htm">23</a>-<a href="http://39-27.cn/耶25.24.htm">24</a>）<br />这也论及属灵教会的荒废，在这几个其它名字中，这属灵教会被称为提玛和亚拉伯。由此明显可知，“提玛”和“亚拉伯”一样，表那些属于属灵教会的人。但诸王，以及城邑被归于亚拉伯，而首领和村庄被归于基达。<br />除此以外，度玛还在以赛亚书（<a href="http://39-27.cn/赛21.11.htm">21:11</a>）中被提及。这些民族之所以表示构成属灵教会的事物，是因为属灵的古教会也存在于他们当中（<a href="1238.htm">1238</a>，<a href="2385.htm">2385</a>节）；尽管他们的教义和仪式各不相同，但他们是一个教会，因为这些人视仁而非信为本质。然而，随着时间推移，由于仁爱走向终结，故他们所具有的该教会的特色也丧失了。尽管如此，教会的一个代表通过他们仍旧存留下来，不过，却照着曾一度存在于他们当中的教会形式而各异。因此，当这些民族在圣言中被提及时，所表示的不是这些民族，而是总体上曾一度存在于那里的教会形式。</p>

The firstborn of Ishmael, Nebaioth; and Kedar, and Adbeel, and Mibsam; and Mishma, and Dumah, and Massa; Hadar, and Tema, Jetur, Naphish, and Kedemah. That these signify all things that belong to the 
spiritual church, especially among the Gentiles, is evident from the representation of those who are here named, some of whom are mentioned elsewhere in the Word, particularly in the prophetical books-as 
Nebaioth, Kedar, Dumah, and Tema-and who there signify such things as belong to the spiritual church, especially among the Gentiles; moreover the same is manifest from their being twelve, for "twelve" 
signifies all things of faith, thus of the church, as will be shown hereafter; and for this reason it is said in the sixteenth verse that they were "twelve princes of their peoples."      [2] That 
by Nebaioth and Kedar are represented the things that belong to the spiritual church, especially among the Gentiles, namely its goods and derivative truths, is evident in Isaiah: </p>
<p>     The abundance 
of camels shall cover thee, the dromedaries of Midian and Ephah; all they from Sheba shall come; they shall bring gold and frankincense, and they shall proclaim the praises of Jehovah. All the flocks 
of Kedar shall be gathered together unto thee, the rams of Nebaioth shall minister unto thee they shall come up with acceptance on Mine altar (Isa. 60:6-7) which in the supreme sense is said of the 
Lord, and in the relative sense of His kingdom. The "flocks of Kedar" denote spiritual good (that a "flock" is spiritual good may be seen above, n. 343, 415, 2566); the "rams of Nebaioth" denote spiritual 
truth (that a "ram" is spiritual truth may be seen above, n. 2833). [3] That "Kedar" is Arabia is manifest from the following passages, and that Arabia was called "Kedar" from the son of Ishmael 
is evident from the fact that in both verses lands or nations are enumerated all of which are named from the sons and grandsons of Abraham-as Midian, Ephah, and Sheba (concerning which see above, verses 
2-4); and here likewise Kedar and Nebaioth. [4] In Ezekiel: </p>
<p>     Arabia, and all the princes of Kedar, these were the merchants of thy hand; in lambs, and rams, and he-goats, in these were they 
thy merchants (Ezek. 27:21); </p>
<p>treating of Tyre, that is, of those who are in the knowledges of good and truth. (That "Tyre" has this signification may be seen above, n. 1201.) "Arabia" denotes spiritual 
good; the "princes of Kedar," spiritual truths; "lambs, rams, and he-goats" denote spiritual goods and truths. [5] In Jeremiah: </p>
<p>     Arise ye, go up to Kedar, and lay waste the sons of the east. 
Their tents and their flocks shall they take; they shall carry away for themselves their curtains, and all their vessels, and their camels (Jer. 49:28-29); </p>
<p>where the subject is the vastation of the 
spiritual church, meant by "Kedar and the sons of the east." "Tents and flocks" denote the goods of this church; "curtains and vessels," its truths; the holy things of worship are what are signified 
by "tents and flocks," and by "curtains and vessels;" and all the holy things of worship relate to good and truth. [6] But those who are not in truth, because not in good, are those who are represented 
by the "Arabians and Kedarites in the wilderness" as in Isaiah: </p>
<p>     Babylon shall not be inhabited forever, neither shall the Arabian pitch tent there (Isa. 13:19, 20). In the same: </p>
<p>     Let the 
wilderness and the cities thereof lift up [their voice], the villages that Kedar doth inhabit (Isa. 42:11). In Jeremiah: </p>
<p>     By the ways hast thou sat for them, as an Arabian in the wilderness (Jer. 
3:2). In David: </p>
<p>     Woe is me, that I sojourn in Meshech, that I dwell with the tents of Kedar (Ps. 120:5). [7] In Isaiah: </p>
<p>     In the forest in Arabia shall ye lodge, O ye travelling companies 
of Dedanites. Bring ye waters to meet him that is thirsty; ye inhabitants of the land of Tema forestall the fugitive with his bread. For they shall wander before the swords, from before the drawn sword, 
from before the bent bow, and from before the grievousness of war. For thus hath the Lord said unto me, Yet within a year, according to the years of a hireling, and all the glory of Kedar shall 
be consumed; and the residue of the number of bows of the mighty men of the sons of Kedar (Isa. 21:13-17). To "lodge in the forest of Arabia" denotes vastation as to truth; "the travelling companies 
of Dedanites" denote those who are in knowledges (n. 3240, 3241); "the inhabitants of the land of Tema" denote those who are in simple good, such as is that of the well-disposed Gentiles. It is evident 
that these were called "Tema" from Ishmael's son. "Kedar" denotes those who are in simple truth; of whom it is said that they shall "wander from before swords, and from before the grievousness of war," 
by which is signified that they will not endure temptation combats, because they are no longer in good. [8] In Jeremiah: </p>
<p>     Pass over to the isles of Kittim, and see; and send unto Kedar, and 
consider diligently, and see whether there hath been done such a thing, whether a nation hath changed gods, which yet are no gods (Jer. 2:10-11); </p>
<p>the "isles of Kittim" denote those who are more remote 
from worship, that is, Gentiles who are in simple good, and thereby in natural truth (n. 1156, 1158); that "Kedar" also denotes the same is manifest. [9] In the same: </p>
<p>     Then took I the cup from 
the hand of Jehovah, and made all the nations to drink, unto whom Jehovah had sent me; Dedan, and Tema, and Buz, and all that are clipped at the corner [of the beard]; and all the kings of Arabia, and 
all the kings of the west, that dwell in the wilderness (Jer. 25:17, 23-24); </p>
<p>where also the vastation of the spiritual church is treated of, and Tema and Arabia are named along with several others, 
from which it is manifest that by "Tema," as by "Arabia," those are signified who are of the spiritual church; but to Arabia are attributed kings and cities, while princes and villages are ascribed to 
Kedar. [10] Besides these, Dumah also is mentioned in Isaiah (21:11). The reason why by these nations are signified the things that belong to the spiritual church, is that the Ancient Church, which 
was spiritual, was also among them (n. 1238, 2385); their doctrinals and rituals differed, and yet they were one church because they did not make faith, but charity, essential. In course of time however, 
as charity ceased, even that which there was of the church with them was lost; yet there still remained a representative of the church by them, with variety according to what there had been of the 
church with them. Hence it is that wherever they are named in the Word, they themselves are not signified, but only that of the church in general which had been there. </p>

<p align="center"><b>Elliott(1983-1999) 3268</b></p><p><b>3268.</b>
'Nebaioth, Ishmael's firstborn, and Kedar, and Abdeel, and Mibsam; and Mishma, and Dumah, and Massa; Hadad, and Tema, Jetur, Naphish, and Kedemah' means everything that constitutes the spiritual Church, 
in particular among the gentiles. This is clear from the representation of these individuals whose names are given. Some of them are mentioned again in the Word, in particular in the prophetical part, 
such as Nebaioth, Kedar, Dumah, and Tema. There they mean such things as constitute the spiritual Church, in particular among gentiles. This is in addition evident from the fact that there are twelve 
of them, and 'twelve' means all things that make up faith, and so the Church, to be dealt with below. In verse 16 below it is therefore said that they were 'twelve princes of their peoples'. </p>
<p></p>
<p><b>[2]</b>
That 'Nebaioth and Kedar' represent those things that constitute the spiritual Church, in particular among gentiles, that is to say, its goods and its truths derived from these, is clear in Isaiah, </p>
<blockquote>
A 
drove of camels will cover you, dromedaries of Midian and Ephah; all those from Sheba will come. They will bring gold and frankincense, and will proclaim the praises of Jehovah. The whole flock 
of Kedar will be gathered to you, the rams of Nebaioth will minister to you; they will come up with acceptance on My altar. <a href="http://bible.gospelcom.net/cgi-bin/bible?passage=Isa%2060:6,%207&amp;version=ESV&amp;interface=print&amp;showfn=yes&amp;showxref">Isa 60:6, 7</a>. 
</blockquote>
<p>This refers in the highest sense to the Lord, and in the relative 
sense to His kingdom. 'The flock of Kedar' stands for spiritual good - 'a flock' being spiritual good, see <a href="343.htm">343</a>, <a href="415.htm">415</a>, <a href="2566.htm">2566</a>. 'The rams of Nebaioth' stands for spiritual truth - 'a ram' being spiritual 
truth, <a href="2833.htm">2833</a>. </p>
<p></p>
<p><b>[3]</b>
 Kedar is Arabia, as is evident from the places quoted below; and Arabia was named Kedar after Ishmael's son, as becomes clear from the fact that the names mentioned in these 
two verses are those of countries or nations which were all named after the sons and grandsons of Abraham, as Midian, Ephah, and Sheba above in verses 2-4, and so Kedar and Nebaioth here. In Ezekiel, </p>
<blockquote>
Arabia 
and all the princes of Kedar, these were the merchants of your hand in lambs, and in rams, and in he-goats. In these they were your merchants. <a href="http://bible.gospelcom.net/cgi-bin/bible?passage=Ezek%2027:21&amp;version=ESV&amp;interface=print&amp;showfn=yes&amp;showxref">Ezek 27:21</a>. 
</blockquote>
<p>This refers to Tyre, that is, to 
people who possess cognitions of good and truth - 'Tyre' being such persons, see <a href="1201.htm">1201</a>. 'Arabia' stands for spiritual good, 'the princes of Kedar' for spiritual truths. 'Lambs, rams, and he-goats' are 
spiritual goods and truths. </p>
<p></p>
<p><b>[4]</b>
 In Jeremiah, </p>
<blockquote>
Arise, go up to Kedar, and lay waste the sons of the east. They will take their tents and their flocks, their curtains and all their vessels, and bear 
their camels away from them. <a href="http://bible.gospelcom.net/cgi-bin/bible?passage=Jer%2049:28,%2029&amp;version=ESV&amp;interface=print&amp;showfn=yes&amp;showxref">Jer 49:28, 29</a>. 
</blockquote>
<p>This refers to the vastation of the spiritual Church meant by 'Kedar' and 'the sons of the east'. 'Tents and flocks' stands for the goods of that Church, 
'curtains and vessels' for its truths. The sacred things of worship are meant by 'tents and flocks', and by 'curtains and vessels'; but the sacred things of worship are all related to good and truth. </p>
<p></p>
<p><b>[5]</b>
Those however who have no truth because no good resides with them are represented by Arabs and Kedarites in the wilderness, as in Isaiah, </p>
<blockquote>
Babel will not be dwelt in for ever, the Arab 
will not remain there. <a href="http://bible.gospelcom.net/cgi-bin/bible?passage=Isa%2013:20&amp;version=ESV&amp;interface=print&amp;showfn=yes&amp;showxref">Isa 13:20</a>. 
</blockquote>
<p>In the same prophet, </p>
<blockquote>
Let the wilderness and its cities lift up [their voice], the villages which Kedar inhabits. <a href="http://bible.gospelcom.net/cgi-bin/bible?passage=Isa%2042:10,%2011&amp;version=ESV&amp;interface=print&amp;showfn=yes&amp;showxref">Isa 42:10, 11</a>. 
</blockquote>
<p>In Jeremiah, </p>
<blockquote>
By the wayside 
you have sat waiting for them, like an Arab in the wilderness. <a href="http://bible.gospelcom.net/cgi-bin/bible?passage=Jer%203:2&amp;version=ESV&amp;interface=print&amp;showfn=yes&amp;showxref">Jer 3:2</a>. 
</blockquote>
<p>In David, </p>
<blockquote>
Woe is me, for I sojourn in Meshech; I delay among the tents of Kedar. <a href="http://bible.gospelcom.net/cgi-bin/bible?passage=Ps%20120:5&amp;version=ESV&amp;interface=print&amp;showfn=yes&amp;showxref">Ps 120:5</a>. 
</blockquote>
<p>In Isaiah, </p>
<blockquote>
In the forest 
in Arabia you will spend the night, O bands of Dedanites. To the thirsty bring water; O inhabitants of the land of Tema, meet with his bread the fugitive, for they will flee before the swords, before 
the drawn sword, before the bent bow, and before the grievousness of war. For thus said the Lord to me, Within a year, according to the year of a hireling, and all the glory of Kedar will come to 
an end; and the remainder of the number of the bows of the mighty men of the sons of Kedar [will be few]. <a href="http://bible.gospelcom.net/cgi-bin/bible?passage=Isa%2021:13-17&amp;version=ESV&amp;interface=print&amp;showfn=yes&amp;showxref">Isa 21:13-17</a>. 
</blockquote>
<p>'Spending the night in the forest of Arabia' stands for being vastated as 
regards truth, and 'the bands of Dedanites' stands for those who possess cognitions, <a href="3240.htm">3240</a>, <a href="3241.htm">3241</a> (end). 'The inhabitants of the land of Tema' stands for those in whom simple good is present, such as exists 
with upright gentiles - people, it is clear, who were descended from Ishmael's son called Tema. 'Kedar' stands for those who possess simple truth, of whom it is said that 'they are going to flee 
before the swords, and before the grievousness of war', which means that they will not experience the conflicts that are brought about by temptations because good does not exist with them any longer. </p>
<p></p>
<p><b>[6]</b>
In Jeremiah, </p>
<blockquote>
Pass over to the islands of the Kittians and see, and send to Kedar and examine closely, and see whether there has been such a thing, whether a nation has changed its gods, which 
are no gods. <a href="http://bible.gospelcom.net/cgi-bin/bible?passage=Jer%202:10,%2011&amp;version=ESV&amp;interface=print&amp;showfn=yes&amp;showxref">Jer 2:10, 11</a>. 
</blockquote>
<p>'The islands of the Kittians' stands for those who are more remote from worship, that is, for gentiles in whom simple good and consequently natural truth are present, <a href="1156.htm">1156</a>, <a href="1158.htm">1158</a> - 'Kedar' also meaning, it is evident, such people. In the same prophet, </p>
<blockquote>
I took the cup from Jehovah's hand and made all the nations to whom Jehovah sent me drink it - Dedan and Tema, and 
Buz, and all who have cut the comers [of their hair]; and all the kings of Arabia, and all the kings of the west, dwelling in the wilderness. <a href="http://bible.gospelcom.net/cgi-bin/bible?passage=Jer%2025:17,%2023,%2024&amp;version=ESV&amp;interface=print&amp;showfn=yes&amp;showxref">Jer 25:17, 23, 24</a>. 
</blockquote>
<p>This too refers to the vastation 
of the spiritual Church which among other  names is called Tema and Arabia. From this it is evident that Tema, like Arabia, means those who belong to the spiritual Church. To Arabia however kings and 
also cities are attributed, but to Kedar princes and villages. </p>
<p></p>
<p><b>[7]</b>
 In addition to these Dumah is also mentioned, in <a href="http://bible.gospelcom.net/cgi-bin/bible?passage=Isaiah%2021:11,%2012&amp;version=ESV&amp;interface=print&amp;showfn=yes&amp;showxref">Isaiah 21:11, 12</a>. The reason why those nations mean the things that constitute the 
spiritual Church is that the Ancient Church, which was a spiritual Church, existed among them also, <a href="1238.htm">1238</a>, <a href="2385.htm">2385</a>, though their doctrinal teachings and religious observances varied. Nevertheless there 
was only one Church because those people made charity, not faith, the essential thing. In course of time however, as charity came to an end, that special feature of the Church which existed with them 
died out. Nevertheless a representative of the Church through them was maintained which differed according to that form of the Church that had once existed among them. Consequently when these nations 
are mentioned in the Word it is not these nations that are meant but only that form of the Church in general  which had once existed there. </p>

{1}Primogenitus Jishmaelis, Nebaioth, et Kedar, et Adbeel, et Mibsam, et Mishma, et Dumah, et Massa, Hadad, et Tema, Jetur, Naphish, et Kedemah: quod significent omnia quae sunt Ecclesiae spiritualis,

regno Ipsius, `grex Kedaris' pro bono spirituali; quod `grex' sit spirituale bonum, videatur n. 343, 415, 2566; `arietes Nebaioth' pro vero spirituali; [3] quod `aries' sit spirituale verum, n. 2833: 
quod Kedar sit Arabia, ex sequentibus locis patet, et quod Arabia (x)nominata sit Kedar a filio Jishmaelis, constare potest ex eo quod quae in binis illis versibus memorantur, sint terrae vel gentes, 
omnes a filiis ac nepotibus Abrahami nominatae, ut Midian, Ephah, Sheba, de quibus supra vers. 2-4, ita hic Kedar et Nebaioth: apud Ezechielem,           Arabia et omnes principes Kedaris, hi negotiatores 
manus      tuae, in agnis, et arietibus, et hircis; in his negotiatores      tui, xxvii 21; </p>
<p>ibi de Tyro, hoc est, de illis qui in cognitionibus boni et veri sunt; quod `Tyrus' illi sint, videatur 
n. 1201; `Arabia' pro spirituali bono, `principes Kedaris' pro spiritualibus veris; `agni, arietes, {5}hirci' sunt spiritualia bona et vera: [4] apud Jeremiam,           Surgite, ascendite ad Kedarem, 
et devastate filios      orientis, tentoria eorum, et greges eorum sument; cortinas      eorum, et omnia vasa eorum, et camelos eorum auferent sibi,      xlix 28, 29; </p>
<p>{6}ibi de vastatione 
Ecclesiae spiritualis per `Kedarem (c)et filios orientis' intellectae; `tentoria et greges' pro Ecclesiae illius bonis, `cortinae et vasa' pro ejus veris; sunt `sancta cultus, quae per `tentoria et greges' 
et per `cortinas et vasa' significantur, sancta autem cultus omnia se referunt ad bonum et verum. [5] Qui autem non in vero sunt quia non in bono, sunt qui repraesentantur per {8}Arabes et per Kedares 
in deserto ut apud Esaiam,           Babel non habitabitur in aeternum, non morabitur ibi      Arabs, xiii 20: </p>
<p>apud eundem,           Extollant desertum, et urbes ejus, villae quas habitat  
    Kedar, xlii 10, 12: </p>
<p>apud jeremiam,           Super viis sedisti illis, sicut Arabs in deserto, iii 2:  apud Davidem,           Vae mihi, quia peregrinor Meshechi, moror cum tentoriis      Kedaris, 
Ps. cxx 5: </p>
<p>apud Esaiam,           In silva in Arabia pernoctabitis turmae Dedanim; obviam      sitienti afferte aquas, habitatores terrae Tema, cum pane ejus      praevenite vagabundum, quia 
coram gladiis vagabuntur, coram      gladio extenso, coram arcu tenso, et coram gravitate belli; </p>
<p>     quia sic dixit Dominus ad me, In adhuc annum, juxta annum      mercenarii, et consumetur omnis 
gloria Kedaris, et reliquum      numeri arcus fortium filiorum Kedaris [paucum erit], xxi 13,      14; </p>
<p>`in silva Arabiae pernoctare' pro vastari quoad verum, `turmae Dedanim' pro illis qui sunt 
in cognitionibus, n. 3240, 3241 f; `habitatores terrae Tema' pro illis qui in simplici bono, in quali gentes probae; {9}qui quod {10}ex filio Jishmaelis Tema dicto {11}fuerint, constat; `Kedar' pro illis 
qui in simplici vero, de quibus dicitur quod `vagaturi coram gladiis, et coram gravitate belli,' quo significatur quod non sustinebunt pugnas tentationum, quia non amplius in bono: [6] apud Jeremiam,  
         Transite insulas Kittaeorum et videte, et Kedarem      mittite, et attendite valde, et videte num factum sicut hoc,      num mutavit gens deos, et illi non dii, (x)ii 10, 11; </p>
<p>`insulae 
Kittaeorum' pro illis qui remotiores a cultu sunt, hoc est, pro gentibus quae in simplici bono et inde in naturale vero, n. 1156, 1158; quod etiam `Kedar' sint illi, patet: apud eundem,           Accepi 
calicem e manu Jehovae, et bibere feci omnes      gentes, ad quas me misit Jehovah,...et Dedanem et Temam, et      Buz, et omnes abscissos anguli; et omnes reges Arabiae, et      omnes reges 
occidentis, habitantes in deserto, xxv 17, 23, 24; </p>
<p>ibi etiam agitur de vastatione Ecclesiae spiritualis, ac inter plures nominantur Tema et Arabia, inde patet quod per `Temam,' sicut per `Arabiam,' significentur 
illi qui ab Ecclesia spirituali sunt; sed Arabiae tribuuntur reges {12}tum urbes, at Kedari principes et villae. [7] Praeter illos etiam Dumah memoratur apud Esaiam xxi 11, 12. Quod per gentes 
illas significentur illa quae sunt Ecclesiae spiritualis, inde est quia Antiqua Ecclesia quae spiritualis erat, etiam apud illos fuit, n. 1238, 2385, sed doctrinalia illorum et ritualia varia fuerunt, 
at usque una Ecclesia, quia non fidem sed charitatem essentialem fecerunt; at temporis tractu, sicut charitas desiit, etiam illud Ecclesiae quod apud illos, nullum factum est, usque tamen mansit 
repraesentativum Ecclesiae per illos, cum varietate secundum illud Ecclesiae quod fuerat apud illos; inde est ubi nominantur in Verbo, quod non significentur illi, sed significetur modo illud Ecclesiae 
in communi quod fuerat ibi. @1 i Filius I$  @2 enim$  @3 hic Ecclesiae spiritualis imprimis apud gentes, n. 577, 2089, 2129 f, 2130 f.$ @4 repraesentativo$  @5 i et$  @6 ubi$  @7 i enim$  @8
