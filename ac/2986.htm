<h3 align="center" class="ired">属天的奥秘 第2986节</h3>
<h4 align="center"></h4><p><strong>2986.</strong>“由赫人”表它由外邦人组成。这从“赫人”的含义清楚可知。赫人不是指那些教会在他们当中建立的人，而是指那些代表教会的人。因为在圣言中，一切事物都具有代表性，他们并非表示叫这些名字的实际的人，而是表示属于主的国度和教会的事物。前面反复说明，“赫人”表示一个新教会，或也可说，表示那些属于这个新教会的人。不过，这个新教会由外邦人组成，或来自外邦人。这从亚伯拉罕对赫人所说的话明显看出来，即“我在你们中间是外人，是寄居的”（23:4），这句话表示他们不认识主，但主仍能与他们同在（<a href="2915.htm">2915</a>节）。由此明显可知，“赫人”表示由外邦人组成的教会。因为他们不认识主不可能是指着其他人说的。<br />此外，要知道，当教会不再是一个教会，也就是仁爱消失，一个新教会由主建立时，这一切很少在旧教会所在的那些人当中成就。相反，新教会在那些以前没有教会的人，也就是外邦人当中建立。这就是上古教会灭亡时所发生的情形。那时，一个名为“挪亚”的新教会，也就是大洪水后的古教会在外邦人，也就是以前没有教会的人当中建立。古教会灭亡时的情形也是这样。那时，一个表面教会通过雅各在亚伯拉罕的后裔，因而同样在外邦人当中建立。因为亚伯拉罕被呼召时就是一个外邦人（参看<a href="1356.htm">1356</a>，<a href="1992.htm">1992</a>，<a href="2559.htm">2559</a>节），而雅各的后代在埃及时更成了外邦人，甚至到了他们根本不知道耶和华，因而不知道任何神性敬拜的地步。这个表面教会终结后，初期教会因犹太人被拒绝而在外邦人当中建立。如今这个被称作基督教会的教会也将面临类似情形。<br />主之所以在外邦人当中建立新教会，是因为他们对信之真理一无所知，故没有违背这些真理的虚假原则。在人能重生、成为一个教会之前，从小就吸收，后来又加以确认的虚假原则必须先被驱散。事实上，外邦人无法以生活的邪恶来亵渎圣物，因为人若不知道何为圣物，是不可能亵渎它的（<a href="593.htm">593</a>，<a href="1008.htm">1008</a>，<a href="1010.htm">1010</a>，<a href="1059.htm">1059</a>节）。外邦人因没有这类知道，故也就没有阻碍他们的绊脚石。因此，他们的状态是这样：比起那些属于教会的人，他们能更好地接受真理；并且凡过着良善生活的人很容易接受真理（参看<a href="932.htm">932</a>，<a href="1032.htm">1032</a>，<a href="1059.htm">1059</a>，<a href="1327.htm">1327</a>，<a href="1328.htm">1328</a>，<a href="1366.htm">1366</a>，<a href="2049.htm">2049</a>，<a href="2051.htm">2051</a>，<a href="2589.htm">2589</a>-<a href="2604.htm">2604</a>节）。<br /></p>

From the sons of Heth. That this signifies that it was a church from the Gentiles, is evident from the signification of the "sons of Heth." The sons of Heth were not those with whom the church was set 
up anew, but are those by whom the church is represented; for all things in the Word are representative; and they do not signify the persons who are named, but through them things of the Lord's kingdom 
and church. That by the "sons of Heth" is signified a new church, or what is the same, those who are of the new church, has been stated above repeatedly; but that it was a new church of the Gentiles, 
or from the Gentiles, is plain from what was said by Abraham to the sons of Heth-"I am a sojourner and a dweller with you" (verse 4); by which is signified that the Lord was not known to them, but 
still that He could be with them (n. 2915). From this it is plain that by the "sons of Heth" is signified a church from the Gentiles; for it cannot be said of others that the Lord is unknown to them. [2] 
Be it known, further, that when any church becomes no church, that is, when charity perishes and a new church is being set up again by the Lord, this is effected rarely if ever with those with whom 
the old church has been; but with those with whom there was no church before, that is, with the Gentiles. So was it done when the Most Ancient Church perished; for then the new church called "Noah," 
that is, the Ancient Church which was after the flood, was set up among the Gentiles, that is, among those where there was no church before. So too when this church perished; then a semblance of a 
church was instituted among the posterity of Abraham from Jacob, thus likewise among the Gentiles; for Abraham when called was a Gentile (see n. 1356, 1992, 2559); and Jacob's posterity in Egypt became 
still more Gentile, even to such an extent that they were absolutely ignorant of Jehovah, and consequently of all Divine worship. After this church had been consummated, the Primitive Church was set 
up from the Gentiles, the Jews being rejected; so too will it be with this church, which is called Christian. [3] The reason why a new church will be set up by the Lord among the Gentiles, is that they 
have no principles of falsity contrary to the truths of faith, for they are ignorant of these truths. Principles of falsity imbued from infancy, and afterwards confirmed, must be shaken off before 
the man can be regenerated and become a church. In fact the Gentiles cannot by evils of life profane holy things, for no one can profane what is holy who knows not what it is (n. 593, 1008, 1010, 1059). 
As the Gentiles are in ignorance, and are free from stumbling-blocks [or difficulties], they are in a better state for the reception of truths than those who are of the church; and all those among 
them who are in the good of life receive truths easily. (Concerning these things see n. 932, 1032, 1059, 1327, 1328, 1366, 2049, 2051, 2589-2604.) </p>

<p align="center"><b>Elliott(1983-1999) 2986</b></p><p><b>2986.</b>
'From the sons of Heth' means that it consisted of gentiles. This becomes clear from the meaning of 'the sons of Heth'. The sons of Heth were not those among whom the Church was established but those 
by whom that Church is represented, for all things in the Word are representative and do not mean the actual persons whose names are mentioned but things that belong to the Lord's kingdom and Church. 
It has been stated in various places already that 'the sons of Heth' means a new Church, or what amounts to the same, those who belong to that new Church. But that it was a new Church consisting of or 
drawn from the gentiles is evident from what Abraham said to the sons of Heth, 'I am a stranger and an inhabitant among you', verse 4, which meant that the Lord was not known to them, yet He was nevertheless 
able to be with them, <a href="2915.htm">2915</a>. From this it is evident that 'the sons of Heth' means a Church consisting of gentiles. It cannot be said of any others that the Lord is not known to them. </p>
<p></p>
<p><b>[2]</b>
Furthermore it should be recognized that when any Church ceases to be a Church, that is, when charity perishes, and a new one is established by the Lord, rarely if ever is this done among those with whom 
the old Church existed. Instead it is established among those with whom no Church existed previously, that is, among gentiles. This is what happened when the Most Ancient Church perished. At that 
time a new one which was called Noah, or the Ancient Church following the Flood, was established among gentiles, that is, among those where no Church existed previously. It was similar when this Church 
perished. At that time the semblance of a Church was introduced among Abraham's descendants through Jacob, and so again among gentiles; for Abraham at the time of his call was a gentile, see <a href="1356.htm">1356</a>, <a href="1992.htm">1992</a>, <a href="2559.htm">2559</a>. The actual descendants of Jacob in Egypt became more gentile still, so much so that they had no knowledge at all of Jehovah or consequently of any Divine worship. After this semblance of a 
Church had come to an end, the Primitive Church was established from among the gentiles, the Jews having been rejected. It will be similar with the Church existing at present called the Christian Church. </p>
<p></p>
<p><b>[3]</b>
The reason why it is among gentiles that the Lord establishes a new Church is that they do not possess any false assumptions that are contrary to the truths of faith, for they have no knowledge 
of the truths of faith. False assumptions absorbed from early childhood and subsequently confirmed must first of all be dispelled before a person can be regenerated and become a member of the Church.<A name="fntext1"></a><A href="#fn1"><sup>a</sup></a> 
Indeed gentiles are not able to profane holy things by means of evils of life, for no one can profane what is holy if he does not know what it is, <a href="593.htm">593</a>, <a href="1008.htm">1008</a>, <a href="1010.htm">1010</a>, <a href="1059.htm">1059</a>. As gentiles do not have 
such knowledge, there are no stumbling-blocks to hinder them. Thus their state is such that they are better able to receive truths than those who belong to the Church; and all those among them who are 
leading a good life receive truths without difficulty, see <a href="932.htm">932</a>, <a href="1032.htm">1032</a>, <a href="1059.htm">1059</a>, <a href="1327.htm">1327</a>, <a href="1328.htm">1328</a>, <a href="1366.htm">1366</a>, <a href="2049.htm">2049</a>, <a href="2051.htm">2051</a>, <a href="2589.htm">2589</a>-<a href="2604.htm">2604</a>.

Quod `ex filiis Heth' significet quod ex gentibus esset, constare potest a significatione `filiorum Heth': filii Heth non fuerunt apud quos {1}Ecclesia instaurata fuit, sed sunt per quos Ecclesia illa 
repraesentatur; sunt enim omnia in Verbo repraesentativa, nec significant personas qui nominantur, sed per illos res quae sunt regni Domini et Ecclesiae; quod per `filios Heth' significetur nova Ecclesia, 
seu quod idem, illi qui a nova Ecclesia, prius passim dictum: at quod nova Ecclesia gentium seu a gentibus, patet ab illis quae dicta sunt ab Abrahamo ad filios Heth, `Peregrinus et incola ego 
vobiscum,' vers. 4, quibus significatum quod Dominus illis ignotus, et tamen usque apud illos esse posset, n. 2915; inde patet quod per `filios Heth' significetur Ecclesia ex gentibus; de aliis non praedicari 
potest quod Dominus ignotus sit.  [2] Praeterea sciendum, cum aliqua Ecclesia fit nulla, hoc est, cum perit charitas, et nova instauratur a Domino, quod raro si usquam hoc fiat apud illos apud 
quos vetus Ecclesia fuit, sed apud quos nulla Ecclesia prius, hoc est, apud gentes; ita factum quando Antiquissima Ecclesia periit, tunc nova quae Noahus dicta, seu Antiqua quae post diluvium, instaurata 
fuit apud gentes, hoc est, apud illos ubi nulla Ecclesia prius; similiter cum haec Ecclesia periit, tunc instar Ecclesiae institutum apud Abrahami posteros ex Jacobo, sic quoque apud gentes; Abrahamus 
enim cum vocatus, fuit gentilis, videatur n. 1356, 1992, 2559; ipsi Jacobi posteri in Aegypto adhuc magis gentiles facti sunt, usque adeo ut nesciverint prorsus Jehovam, proinde omnem cultum Divinum; 
postquam {2}hoc Ecclesiae consummatum fuit, tunc Primitiva Ecclesia a gentibus instaurata est, rejectis Judaeis; similiter erit cum hac Ecclesia quae Christiana dicitur.  [3] Causa quod apud gentes 
nova Ecclesia a Domino instauretur, est quia nulla principia falsi habent contra vera fidei, ignorant enim vera fidei; principia falsi imbuta ab infantia et postea confirmata, discutienda prius 
sunt antequam regenerari potest homo, et fieri {3}Ecclesiae; immo gentes per mala vitae profanare non possunt sancta, nemo enim profanare sanctum potes qui ignorat quid sit, n. 593, 1008, 1010, 1059; 
{4}gentiles, quia in ignorantia, absque offendiculis, ita sunt in statu recipiendi vera prae illis qui ab Ecclesia, et vera facile recipiunt omnes illi inter illos qui in bono vitae sunt, videatur de 
his n. 932, 1032, 1059, 1327, 1328, 1366 2049, 2051, 2589-2604. @1 nova Ecclesia spiritualis$  @2 In A S wrote haec Ecc...then d and wrote hoc Ecclesiae.  We may supply instar from five lines above.$
