<h4 align="center"></h4><p><strong>883.</strong>“到了晚上，鸽子回到他那里”表它们开始一点一点地显现，“到了晚上”类似于黎明前的曙色朦胧。这一点同样从前面有关第8节的论述，以及此处提及“晚上”的事实清楚可知。至于“晚上”，可参看创世记第一章的内容，其中六次提到“有晚上，有早晨”。“晚上”是一个与重生相关的词，事实上说明此人仍处于近似黑暗，或仅有一点微光向他显现的状态中。下面第13节用他“移开方舟的盖观看”来描述早晨本身。由于“晚上”表黎明前的曙色朦胧，所以论及犹太教会时多次提到了“晚上”。由于同样的原因，他们在晚上开始其安息日和筵席，并且亚伦被命令晚上点亮圣灯（出埃及记<a href="http://39-27.cn/出27.20.htm">27:20</a>-<a href="http://39-27.cn/出27.21.htm">21</a>）。</p>

<p><strong>[NCE]883.</strong> The dove returned to him at evening time means that goodness and truth began to show just a little bit, evening time resembling conditions during the half-light that precedes morning. This can be seen from the things said above at verse <a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_883/bible_king-james-version_genesis_8_9" target=_top>9</a>{*1} and from the reference here to evening time. Concerning evening, see the statements made at <a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_883/bible_king-james-version_genesis_1_1-31" target=_top>Genesis 1</a> [<a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_883/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_22" target=_top>22</a>], which says six times that there was evening and there was morning. Evening is a term connected with regeneration, specifically with the phase when we are still living in shadow, or when not much light at all shines inside us as yet. The actual morning is portrayed in verse <a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_883/bible_king-james-version_genesis_8_13" target=_top>13</a> by "he removed the roof of the ark and looked."<br />The fact that [in the original language the word for] evening meant the half-light before morning explains the frequent references to evening in the Jewish religion.{*2} It also explains why their Sabbaths and feast days began in the evening and why Aaron was commanded to light the sacred lamp at evening (<a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_883/bible_king-james-version_exodus_27_1-21" target=_top>Exodus 27</a>: [20,] 21).{*3} <br /><strong>Footnotes:</strong><br />{*1} The translation here is based on reading "9" for the first Latin edition's "8."

And the dove came back to him at eventide. That this signifies that little by little the goods and truths of faith began to appear, and that "eventide" means as in the twilight before morning, is likewise 
evident from what has been said above, at the eighth verse; as well as from the fact that the time of evening is here mentioned. In regard to "evening" see what was said under the first chapter 
of Genesis, where it is said six times, "there was evening and there was morning." "Evening" is a term of regeneration, and indeed of that state of it when the man is still in shade, or when as yet only 
a little light is apparent to him. The morning itself is described in the thirteenth verse by Noah's removing the covering of the ark and seeing. It was because "evening" signified the twilight before 
morning, that "evening" is so many times mentioned in connection with the Jewish Church. For the same reason also they began their sabbaths and their feasts in the evening, and Aaron was commanded 
to light the holy lamp in the evening (Exod. 27:20-21). </p>

'The dove returned to him at evening time' means that these started to show themselves a little; and 'evening time' is similar to pre-morning twilight. This in like manner becomes clear from that has 
been stated already at verse 8, and also from the fact that here it is called 'evening time'. Concerning 'evening', see what has been stated in Genesis <a href="1.htm">1</a>, where six times the statement is made 'there 
was evening and there was morning'. 'Evening' is a word that has to do with regeneration and indeed with that state when a person is still in near-darkness, or when there is still only a tiny quantity 
of light showing itself to him. Morning itself is described in verse 13 below by 'he removed the roof from the ark and saw out'. Because 'evening' meant the pre-morning twilight, mention of the evening 
is made so many times in the Jewish Church. This also is why sabbaths and festivals began from evening onwards, and why Aaron was commanded to light the sacred lamp 'in the evening', <a href="http://bible.gospelcom.net/cgi-bin/bible?passage=Exod%2027:21&amp;version=ESV&amp;interface=print&amp;showfn=yes&amp;showxref">Exod 27:21</a>. </p>

</p><b>883.</b>
Quod 'reversa est ad illum columba ad tempus vesperae' significet quod pauxillum apparere inciperent et quod 'tempus vesperae' sit sicut in diluculo ante mane, constare similiter potest ab illis quae 
dicta sunt prius ad vers. 8, tum ab eo quod hic dicatur 'tempus vesperae'; de vespera videantur quae dicta sunt in cap. 1 Gen., ubi sexies dicitur, quod 'fuit vespera et fuit mane'; est 'vespera' vox 
regenerationis, et quidem illius ejus status cum adhuc in umbra est, seu cum adhuc modo pauxillum ex luce apud eum appareat; ipsum mane describitur in vers. seq. 13 per quod 'removit tectum arcae, et 
vidit.' Quia 'vespera' significabat diluculum ante mane, in Ecclesia Judaica toties mentio vesperae fit; tum ideo incoharunt sabbata et festa sua a vespera; ut et mandatum Aharoni ut accenderet lucernam 
sanctam 'vespere,' Exod. xxvii 21. </p>
