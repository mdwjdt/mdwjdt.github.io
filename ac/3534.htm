Verses 14-17. And he went, and took, and brought to his mother; and his mother made dainties, such as his father loved. And Rebekah took garments of desires of Esau her elder son that were with her in 
the house, and put them upon Jacob her younger son. And the skins of the kids of the she-goats she caused to be put upon his hands, and upon the smooth of his neck. And she gave the dainties, and the 
bread, which she had made, into the hand of Jacob her son. "And he went, and took, and brought to his mother," signifies a state of obedience of the truth of the natural; "and his mother made dainties, 
such as his father loved," signifies things that are delectable, but not desirable; "and Rebekah took garments of desires of Esau her elder son," signifies the genuine truths of good; "that were with 
her in the house," signifies that were from the Divine good through the Divine truth of the Divine rational; "and put them upon Jacob her younger son," signifies the affection of truth, or the life 
of good from truth; "and the skins of the kids of the she-goats," signifies the external truths of domestic good; "she caused to be put upon his hands," signifies according to the faculty of receiving; 
"and upon the smooth of his neck," signifies that disjoining truth should not appear; "and she gave the dainties," signifies delectable things thence derived; "and the bread," signifies the good thence 
derived; "which she had made," signifies which were from Divine truth; "into the hand of Jacob her son," signifies that such was the affection of natural truth. </p>

Verses 14-17 And he went and took them, and brought them to his mother; and his mother made savoury food such as his father loved. And Rebekah took the best clothes<A name="fntext1"></a><A href="#fn1"><sup>a</sup></a> of Esau her elder son, which were 
with her in the house, and put them on Jacob her younger son. And she put the skins of the kids of the she-goats on his hands and on the smooth of his neck. And she gave the savoury food and the bread 
which she had made into the hand of Jacob her son. </p>
<p>'He went and took them, and brought them to his mother' means a state of the obedience of natural truth. 'And his mother made savoury food such 
as his father loved' means things that are delightful, yet not desirable. 'And Rebekah took the best clothes of Esau her elder son' means genuine truths that clothe good. 'Which were with her in the house' 
means which come from Divine Good by way of the Divine Truth of the Divine Rational. 'And put them on Jacob her younger son' means the affection for truth, that is, the life of good originating 
in truth. 'And she put the skins of the kids of the she-goats' means the external truths clothing homeborn good. 'On his hands' means according to the ability to receive. 'And on the smooth of his neck' 
means so that truth which disjoined was not apparent. 'And she gave the savoury food' means things that are delightful from that source. 'And the bread' means good from that source. 'Which she had 
made' means which came from Divine Truth. 'Into the hand of Jacob her son' means that such was the affection for natural truth.

Vers. 14-17.  Et ivit, et accepit, et adduxit matri suae, et fecit mater illius cupedias, quemadmodum amavit pater illius. Et accepit Rebecca vestes Esavi filii sui majoris desideriorum, quae cum illa 
in domo, et induit Jacobum filium suum minorem. Et pelles haedorum caprarum indui fecit super manus illius, et super levitatem collorum illius. Et dedit cupedias, et panem, quae fecit, in manum Jacobi 
filii sui. `Ivit, et accepit, et adduxit matri suae' significat statum oboedientiae veri naturalis: `et fecit mater illius cupedias, quemadmodum amavit pater ejus' significat delectabilia, non autem 
desiderabilia: `et accepit Rebecca vestes Esavi filii sui majoris desideriorum' significat veri genuina boni: `quae cum illa in domo' significat quae ex Divino Bono per Divinum Verum Divini Rationalis: 
`et induit Jacobum filiam suum minorem' significat affectionem veri, seu vitam boni ex vero: `et pelles haedorum caprarum indui fecit' significat externa vera boni domestici: `super manus illius'
