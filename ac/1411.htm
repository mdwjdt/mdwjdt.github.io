<h3 align="center" class="ired">属天的奥秘 第1411节</h3>
<h4 align="center"></h4><p><strong>1411.</strong>“你要离开本地”表祂要从肉体和世俗之物中退出。这从“地（或陆地）”的含义（在拉丁文中，terra一词既表“陆地”，也表“地”）清楚可知，“地（或陆地）”的含义随着它所论及的那个人或物而各异。如在创世记第一章，“地（或陆地）”还表外在人（参看<a href="82.htm">82</a>，<a href="620.htm">620</a>，<a href="636.htm">636</a>，<a href="913.htm">913</a>节）。它在此则表肉体和世俗之物，原因在于，这些事物属于外在人。“地（或陆地）”的本义是指陆地、地区或王国；它也指其上的居民，以及它的百姓和那里的民族。因此，“地（或陆地）”这个词不仅广义上表百姓或民族，而且狭义上表居民。当用“地（或陆地）”这个词来论及居民时，它的含义与它所论及的真实事物一致。它在此与肉体和世俗之物有关，因为亚伯兰要离开的本地是属偶像崇拜的。因此，就历史意义而言，这里的意思是说，亚伯兰应离开那地，但就代表意义而言，意思则是主要从属外在人的事物中退出，也就是说，外在事物不应挡道，或带来困扰；由于主是所论述的主题，故它表示主的外在应与其内在一致。</p><br />

<p><strong>[NCE]1411.</strong> The symbolism of go from your land as the bodily and worldly concerns that he{*1} would withdraw from can be seen from the symbolism of land, which varies, depending on the person or thing with which it is associated. Take the first chapter of Genesis, and other places, where land also symbolizes our outer self (搂搂<a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_1411/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_82" target=_top>82</a>, <a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_1411/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_620" target=_top>620</a>, <a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_1411/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_636" target=_top>636</a>, <a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_1411/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_913" target=_top>913</a>). The reason it means bodily and worldly concerns here is that these concerns belong to the outer self.<br />Strictly speaking, a land means the land itself, or an area, or a country. It is also an inhabitant there, or else the people itself or the nationality itself that lives in that land. So the name of a land means not only a people or nationality, in a broad sense, but also an inhabitant, in a narrow sense. When a land is associated with a single inhabitant, the symbolism depends on the reason for the association. Here the reference is to bodily and worldly matters because the land of birth that Abram was to leave was an idolatrous one. So the narrative here says that he was going to leave that land, but the representative meaning is that he would withdraw from the preoccupations of the outer self; in other words, superficial concerns would not conflict or interfere. And since this is about the Lord, the meaning is that superficial aspects would actually harmonize with deeper ones.<br /><br /><strong>Footnotes:</strong><br />{*1} In these passages describing the inner meaning, "he" without other antecedent refers to the Lord.

Get thee out of thy land. That this signifies the corporeal and worldly things from which He was to recede, is evident from the signification of "land" or "earth,"* which is variable, adapting itself 
to the person or thing of which it is predicated-as in the first chapter of Genesis, where likewise "earth" signifies the external man (see also n. 82, 620, 636, 913). That it here signifies corporeal 
and worldly things, is because these are of the external man. A "land," in the proper sense, is the land, region, or kingdom itself; it is also the inhabitant thereof; and also the people itself and 
the nation itself, in the land. Thus the word "land" not only signifies in a broad sense the people or the nation, but also in a limited sense the inhabitant. When the word "land" is used with reference 
to the inhabitant, its signification is then in accordance with the thing concerning which it is used. It is here used respecting corporeal and worldly things; for the land of his birth, out of which 
Abram was to go, was idolatrous. In the historical sense, therefore, the meaning here is that Abram should go out from that land; but in the representative sense, that He should recede from the things 
which are of the external man; that is, that external things should not resist, nor bring in disturbance; and because this is concerning the Lord, it signifies that His externals should agree with 
His internals. * The Latin word terra means both "land" and "earth." </p>

<p align="center"><b>Elliott(1983-1999) 1411</b></p><p><b>1411.</b>
'Go away from your land' means the bodily and worldly things from which He was to depart. This is clear from the meaning of 'land', which is varied depending on the person or thing to which it refers, 
as also in Genesis <a href="1.htm">1</a> where 'land', or 'earth', likewise meant the external man, and elsewhere, <a href="82.htm">82</a>, <a href="620.htm">620</a>, <a href="636.htm">636</a>, <a href="913.htm">913</a>. The reason why here it means bodily and worldly things is that these belong to the external 
man. 'Land' in the proper sense is a land itself, region, or kingdom; also the one who inhabits it, as well as its people, and the nation that is there. Thus the word 'land' not only means in 
a broad sense the people or nation but also in a narrower sense the inhabitant. When land is used with reference to the inhabitant the meaning is in accordance with the real things involved in such a 
reference; in this case bodily and worldly things are involved, because the land of his birth from which Abram was to go was idolatrous. Thus in the historical sense the meaning here is that Abram was 
to go away from that land, but in the representative sense that the Lord was to depart from the things belonging to the external man, that is, that external things should not get in the way or cause 
disturbance, and, since the Lord is the subject, that External things should accord with Internal. </p>

</p><b>1411.</b>
'Abi e terra tua': quod significet corporea et mundana a quibus recederet, constat a significatione 'terrae' quae varia es seque habet applicate ad personam seu rem de qua praedicatur, sicut etiam in 
primo capite Geneseos ubi 'terra' quoque significavit externum hominem; et alibi, n. 82, 620, 636, 913; quod hic corporea et mundana est causa quia haec sunt externi hominis.  Terra in proprio sensu 
est ipsa terra, regio, aut regnum, etiam est incola qui ibi, tum ipse populus et ipsa gens quae in terra illa; ita vox terrae non solum significat in lato sensu populum seu gentem, sed etiam in stricto 
incolam; cum praedicatur terra de incola, tunc se habet significatio secundum rem de qua praedicatio, hic de corporeis et mundanis, nam terra nativitatis e qua abiret Abramus, erat idololatrica, ita 
hic in sensu historico quod 'abiret ab illa terra,' sed in sensu repraesentativo est quod ab illis quae sunt externi hominis recederet, hoc est, quod externa non resisterent nec interturbarent; et quia 
de Domino, quod Externa concordarent cum Internis. </p>
