<h3 align="center" class="ired">属天的奥秘 第2359节</h3>
<h4 align="center"></h4><p><strong>2359.</strong>“不，我的弟兄们，请不要作恶”表他们不该对这些人，也就是仁之善和主的神圣人性并神圣活动施暴。这从“作恶”的含义清楚可知，“作恶”是指施暴。由此明显可知，所论述的主题是那些教会中人，“所多玛人”所指的正是他们。因为除了拥有圣言的人外，没人能对这些圣物施暴。从以下事实可以看出，这些事物是最神圣的：即没人可以进入主的国度，即进入天堂，除非他拥有爱与仁之善；没人能拥有爱与仁之善，除非他承认主的神性和神圣；因为这善唯独从祂那里流入，事实上，流入来自祂的良善本身。神性若不流入神性之物，就无法流入进来；若不藉由主的神圣人性及其源于此的神圣，就无法与人交流。由此可以理解，“主是其国度全部中的全部，以及人所具有的良善根本不是人的，而是主的”这些话是什么意思。</p>

I pray you my brethren do not wickedly. That this signifies that they should not do violence to them, namely, to the good of charity and the Lord's Divine Human and Holy proceeding, is evident from the 
signification of "doing wickedly," as being to do violence. From all this it is evident that those are treated of who are within the church, and that it is they who are meant by the "men of Sodom;" 
for no one can do violence to these holy things except one who is in possession of the Word. That these things are most holy can be seen from the fact that no one can be admitted into the Lord's kingdom 
(that is, into heaven) unless he is in the good of love and of charity; and no one can be in the good of love and of charity, unless he acknowledges the Lord's Divine and Holy; for this good flows 
in from Him alone, and indeed into the good itself which is from Him. The Divine cannot flow in except into the Divine, nor be communicated to man except through the Lord's Divine Human and His Holy 
thence derived. From this we can understand how it is that the Lord is the all in all of His kingdom; and also that nothing of the good that is with man is man's, but is the Lord's. </p>

'No, my brothers, do not act wickedly' means that no violence should be done to these, that is to say, to the good that flows from charity, or to the Lord's Divine Human and His Holy proceeding. This 
is clear from the meaning of 'acting wickedly' as doing violence. All these considerations show that the subject is people inside the Church and that it is these who are meant by 'the men of Sodom', 
for nobody is capable of violating those things except him who possesses the Word. The utter holiness of those things becomes clear from the consideration that nobody can be admitted into the Lord's kingdom, 
that is, into heaven, unless the good of love and charity exists in him; and that cannot exist with anyone unless he acknowledges the Lord's Divinity and [proceeding] Holiness. It is from Him 
alone that this good flows in, and indeed into good itself of which He is the source. The Divine cannot flow in except into that which is Divine; nor can it be communicated to man except through the Lord's 
Divine Human and His Holy deriving from this. From this one can understand what is implied when it is said that the Lord is the All in all of His kingdom, and that no good at all residing with man 
is man's but the Lord's. </p>

</p><b>2359.</b>
`Ne quaeso, fratres mei, malefaciatis': quod significet ne violarent illa, nempe bonum charitatis ac Divinum Humanum et Sanctum procedens Domini, constat a significatione `malefacere' quod `sit violare. 
 Ex his, quod agatur de illis qui intra Ecclesiam, et quod ii sint qui per `viros Sodomae' intelliguntur, patet, nam violare illa nemo potest nisi qui Verbum habet.  Quod haec sanctissima sint, constare 
potest ex eo quod nemo admitti queat in regnum Domini, hoc est, in caelum, nisi sit in bono amoris et charitatis, et nemo in bono amoris et charitatis esse potest nisi agnoscat Domini Divinum 
et Sanctum; ab Ipso Solo illud influit, et quidem in ipsum bonum quod ab Ipso; Divinum non potest influere nisi in Divinum, nec communicari homini nisi per Divinum Humanum et inde Sanctum Domini; inde 
intelligi potest quid sit quod Dominus sit Omne in omnibus Sui regni, tum quod nihil boni quod apud hominem, sit hominis, sed Domini. </p>
