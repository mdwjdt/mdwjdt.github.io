<h3 align="center" class="ired">属天的奥秘 第1469节</h3>
<h4 align="center"></h4><p><strong>1469.</strong>作为妻子的“撒莱”表与主所具有的属天事物联结的真理。这从刚才有关“他妻子撒莱”含义的阐述清楚可知。之所以说“与属天事物联结的真理”，是因为主在接受教导之前就已具备真理。属天事物本身就具有真理，因为这一个离不开另一个，就象光离不开火焰那样；不过，这真理被储存在主的内在人中，也就是神性中。祂所学习的知识并非真理，只不过是接受的容器，就象存于人内的记忆绝非真理，尽管它被称为真理；但真理就存于其中，如居于容器中。主通过来自圣言的认知的教导形成这些容器，确切地说，打开它们；不仅为了属天之物能被植入它们，还为了属天之物能以这种方式变成神性；因为主要将神性本质与人性本质结合起来，以便祂的人性本质也可以变成神性。</p><br />

<p><strong>[NCE]1469.</strong> The fact that Sarai his wife is truth connected to the heavenly capacities the Lord had inside him is established by the statements just made concerning Sarai as a wife.<br />The reason I say truth connected to heavenly capacities is that the Lord already had all truth inside him 钬?a heavenly quality carries truth with it; the one is as inseparable from the other as light is from a flame 钬?but it was hidden in his inner self, which was divine. Secular and religious knowledge, which he gained by study, are not truth but only vessels for receiving truth. The things we have in our memory are anything but truth, even if truth is attributed to them. Instead, they function as vessels that hold truth. The Lord had to form or rather open up these vessels by being instructed in concepts from the Word. The goal was not only to infuse heavenly characteristics into those concepts but also to make the concepts themselves heavenly and therefore divine. The Lord united his divine nature to his human nature so that his human nature would also become divine. </p>

That "Sarai," as a wife, is the truth that was adjoined to the celestial things which were in the Lord, is evident from what has just been said concerning the signification of Sarai his wife. It is said, 
"the truth that was adjoined to celestial things," because the Lord possessed all truth previous to His instruction. What is celestial has truth with it, the one being inseparable from the other, 
as light is from flame; but this truth was stored up in the Lord's internal man, which was Divine. The knowledges [scientifica et cognitiones] that He learned are not truths [vera seu veritates], but 
are only recipient vessels; just as whatever is in man's memory is by no means truth, although it is so called; but the truth is therein, as in vessels. These vessels were to be formed, or rather to 
be opened, by the Lord, through instruction in knowledges from the Word; not only that celestial things might be insinuated into them, but also that the celestial things might in this way be made Divine; 
for the Lord conjoined the Divine Essence with the Human Essence in order that His Human things might likewise be made Divine. </p>

<p align="center"><b>Elliott(1983-1999) 1469</b></p><p><b>1469.</b>
That 'Sarai his wife' is truth allied to the celestial things that resided with the Lord is clear from what has just been stated about the meaning of 'Sarai his wife' The reason for the expression 'truth 
allied to celestial things' is that all truth resided with the Lord already. That which is celestial has truth with it, one being as inseparable from the other as light from flame. Such truth however 
was stored away in His Internal Man, which was Divine The facts and cognitions which He learned were not truths, only recipient vessels, just as something in the human memory is by no means truth 
even though it is referred to as such. Rather the truth is held within them as its vessels These vessels were to be formed by the Lord - or rather opened up by Him - through instruction in cognitions 
from the Word, not only in order that celestial things might be implanted in them but also in order that celestial things might in this way be made Divine; for the Lord joined the Divine Essence to the 
Human Essence in order that His Human Essence might be made Divine also. </p>

</p><b>1469.</b>
Quod 'Sarai uxor' sit verum adjunctum caelestibus quae fuerunt apud Dominum, constat ex illis quae nunc de significatione Sarai uxoris dicta sunt.  Quod dicatur veram adjunctum caelestibus, inde est 
quod omne verum apud Dominum fuit prius; caeleste secum habet verum, unum inseparabile est ab altero sicut lux a flamma, sed reconditum fuit in Interno Ipsius Homine Qui Divinus; scientifica et cognitiones 
quae addidicit, non sunt vera seu veritates sed modo sunt vasa recipientia; sicut quicquid est in memoria hominis, nihil minus est quam verum tametsi praedicatur; sed in illis ut in vasis, est 
verum; haec vasa per instructionem in cognitionibus ex Verbo a Domino formanda erant seu potius aperienda, ut non solum illis insinuarentur caelestia sed ut fierent quoque caelestia ita Divina; Dominus 
erum conjunxit Divinam Essentiam Humanae ut Humana Ipsius fierent quoque Divina. </p>
