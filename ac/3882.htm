<h3 align="center" class="ired">属天的奥秘 第3882节</h3>
<h4 align="center"></h4><p><strong>3882.</strong>“她才停了生育”表搭着从地甚至直到耶和华或主的梯子上升。这从“生育”或生产的含义清楚可知，“生育”或生产是指真理与良善；因为这些就是属灵意义上的生产，因为人通过真理与良善得以重生或新生。这类真理与良善就是利亚所生的四个儿子，即流便、西缅、利未、犹大所表示的。“流便”表示作为重生或新生第一步的真理。这种真理仅仅是记忆知识，因而纯粹是对真理的认识。“西缅”表示作为重生或新生第二步的真理，这种真理存在于意愿中，因而是一种渴求真理的意愿。“利未”表示作为重生或新生第三步的真理，人对这种真理感受到一种情感，因而对真理有一种情感，这种情感与仁爱是一样的。而“犹大”表示良善，也就是重生或新生的第四步，这种良善是爱的属天形式。当重生之人，或新生之人到达这一阶段时，主便向他显现，因为这时，他已经如同爬梯子那样从最低的台阶上升到主所在的那个台阶。<br />这也是雅各在梦中所看到的立在地上、头顶着天、神的使者在上面上去下来、而耶和华或主就在上头的那架梯子所表示的上升（对此，参看创世记<a href="http://39-27.cn/创28.12.htm">28:12</a>）。由此明显可知，这就是“她才停了生育”的含义。“怀孕和生育”在此提到了四次，表示从外在之物到内在之物，或从真理到良善的发展，也就是从地到天的发展（参看<a href="3860.htm">3860</a>，<a href="3868.htm">3868</a>，<a href="3874.htm">3874</a>，<a href="3879.htm">3879</a>节）。此后就下来，因为人若不先上去，就不可能下来。下来无非是指通过良善审视真理，如同从一座他所爬上去的高山俯瞰山下的事物。显然，他从这个位置以一种视野来审视，能领略到无数事物，远比站在下面或山谷之人所能领略到的多得多。这种情形和那些处于良善，也就是处于对主之爱和对邻之仁的人相对于那些仅处于真理，也就是唯独处于信仰之人的一模一样。</p>

And she stood still from bearing. That this signifies ascent by a ladder from the earth to Jehovah or the Lord, is evident from the signification of "bearing," or of "birth," as being truth and good; 
for these are births in the spiritual sense, inasmuch as man is regenerated or born anew by means of truth and good. These also are what are signified by the four sons born of Leah-Reuben, Simeon, Levi, 
and Judah. "Reuben" signifies the truth which is the first of regeneration, or of the new birth; this is truth merely as to memory-knowledge, thus it is to know truth. "Simeon" signifies the truth 
which is the second of regeneration, or of the new birth; this is truth as to the will, thus it is to will truth. "Levi" signifies the truth which is the third of regeneration, or of the new birth; this 
is truth as to affection, thus it is to be affected with truth, which is the same thing as charity. But "Judah" signifies good, which is the fourth of regeneration, or of the new birth, and this is 
the celestial of love. When the regenerate man, or he who is born anew, arrives at this stage, the Lord appears to him, for he has then ascended from the lowest step, as by a ladder, up to the step 
where the Lord is.  [2] This also is the ascent which was signified by the ladder seen by Jacob in a dream, which stood upon the earth, whose top reached to heaven, and on which the angels of God ascended 
and descended, and upon which stood Jehovah or the Lord (concerning which see the foregoing chapter, verse 12). Hence it is evident that such is the signification of "standing still from bearing." 
That by "conceiving and bearing," here mentioned four times, is signified advancement from external to internal, or from truth to good, that is, from earth to heaven, may be seen above (n. 3860, 3868, 
3874, 3879). Descent follows afterwards, for man cannot descend unless he has first ascended.  Descent is nothing else than looking at truth from good, as from a mountain upon which he has climbed, 
a man views the things which lie beneath. That he then can comprehend in one view innumerable things more than they who stand beneath or in the valley, is manifest; and the case is precisely the same 
with those who are in good (that is, in love to the Lord and in charity toward the neighbor), as compared with those who are only in truth, that is, in faith alone. </p>

<p align="center"><b>Elliott(1983-1999) 3882</b></p><p><b>3882.</b>
'And she left off bearing' means the ascent up a stairway from earth even to Jehovah or the Lord. This is clear from the meaning of 'bearing' or birth as truth and good, for these are births in the spiritual 
sense, in that a person is regenerated or born anew by means of truth and good. Such truth and good is also what were meant by Leah's four who were born to her - Reuben, Simeon, Levi, and Judah. 
'Reuben' meant truth as this exists on the first step in regeneration or rebirth - truth which is no more than knowledge, and so merely a knowledge of truth. 'Simeon' meant truth as this exists on 
the second step in regeneration or rebirth - truth present in the will, and so a will desiring truth. 'Levi' meant truth as it exists on the third step in regeneration or rebirth - truth for which one 
feels an affection, and so an affection for truth, which is the same as charity. But 'Judah' meant good which exists on the fourth step in regeneration or rebirth - good which is the celestial form 
of love. When a person who has been regenerated or born anew has come this far the Lord manifests Himself to him, for he has by now risen up from the lowest step, as if by a stairway, to the one where 
the Lord is. </p>
<p></p>
<p><b>[2]</b>
 This stepping up is also meant by the stairway seen in a dream by Jacob which was set up on the earth, a stairway whose top reached to heaven, and on which the angels of God were 
going up and coming down, with Jehovah or the Lord standing above it, described in Chapter 28:12. From this it is evident that 'she left off bearing' has the meaning that has been stated. For explanations 
that the four conceptions and births spoken of meant an advance from what is external to what is internal, or from truth to good, that is, from earth to heaven, see <a href="3860.htm">3860</a>, <a href="3868.htm">3868</a>, <a href="3874.htm">3874</a>, <a href="3879.htm">3879</a>. Coming 
down is subsequent to this, for no one is able to come down before he has gone up. Coming down however is nothing else than surveying truth from good, as when one climbs a mountain and then regards the 
things that lie below. From that position he can, in a single survey of the scene, take in an incalculably greater number of things than people standing below or in the valley, as is evident to anyone. 
It is exactly the same with those who are governed by good, that is, by love to the Lord and charity towards the neighbour. These can see incalculably more than those governed merely by truth, that 
is, by faith alone. </p>

`Et substitit a pariendo': quod significet per scalam ascensum a terra usque ad Jehovam seu Dominum, constat a significatione `parere seu partus' quod sit verum et bonum, nam haec sunt partus in 
sensu spirituali, homo enim regeneratur seu e novo nascitur per verum et bonum; haec etiam sunt quae significata sunt per quatuor partus Leae, Reubenem {1}, Shimeonem, Levi et Jehudam; per `Reubenem' 
verum quod primum regenerationis seu renascentiae est, hoc modo est quoad scientiam, ita scire verum; </p>
<p>per `Shimeonem' verum quod alterum regenerationis seu renascentiae est, hoc verum est quoad 
voluntatem, ita velle verum; per `Levi' verum quod tertium regenerationis seu renascentiae est, hoc quoad affectionem est', ita affici vero, quod idem est cum charitate; per `Jehudam' autem bonum quod 
quartum regenerationis seu renascentiae est, quod est caeleste amoris; cum regeneratus seu e novo natus ad hoc pervenit, tunc apparet ei Dominus, ascenderat enim tunc ab infimo gradu sicut per 
scalam usque ad gradum ubi Dominus; [2] hic etiam ascensus est qui significatus est per scalam in somnio visam Jacobo statutam terrae cujus caput pertingeret caelum, et in qua angeli Dei ascenderent 
et descenderent, et super qua Jehovah seu Dominus staret, de qua i capite praecedente xxviii, vers. 12; inde patet quod per `substitit a pariendo' illud significetur.  Quod per concipere et parere 
quater dicta, progressus ab externo ad internum, seu a vero ad bonum, hoc est, e terra ad caelum, significatus sit, videatur n. 3860, 3868, 3874, 3879 Descensus dein sequitur, descendere enim homo 
non potest nisi prius ascenderat; </p>
<p>descensus autem non aliud est quam ex bono prospicere verum, sicut a monte, ad quem homo enisus est, illa quae infra jacent quod tunc uno intuitu comprehendere possit 
innumerabilia prae {2} illis qui infra aut in valle stant, unicuique patet; similiter (t)se prorsus habet cum illis qui in bono sunt, hoc est, in amore in Dominum e in charitate erga proximum, 
prae illis qui modo in vero sunt, hoc est in sola fide. @1 i nempe per$ @2 pro$ </p>
