<h4 align="center"></h4><p><strong>4174.</strong>“无论是白日被偷的，是黑夜被偷的”表寻求功德的邪恶以同样的方式。这从“偷”或“窃取”的含义清楚可知，“偷”或“窃取”是指寻求功德的邪恶。当人将良善归于自己，以为它源于自己，并因此渴望救恩时，这种寻求功德的邪恶就会存在。这就是“偷”或“窃取”在内义上所指的邪恶。至于这种邪恶，情况是这样：凡正被改造的人都以为良善源于他们自己，进而以为他们凭自己所行的良善配得救赎。事实上，他们以为凭自己所行的良善配得救赎，就是他们以为良善源于他们自己的结果，因为这个观念粘附着那个观念。但那些允许自己重生的人不会在思维上确认这一切，或信服这类观念是正确的。相反，这些观念会逐渐被驱散。事实上，只要人在外在人中，如所有人在重生之初的情形，他不可避免地这样思想，因为他只凭外在人思考。<br />但是，当外在人连同其恶欲正被移除，并且内在人正开始作工时，也就是说，当主以聪明之光经由内在人流入，并由此光照外在人时，此人便开始以不同的方式思考，并将良善归于主，而不是归于他自己。由此可见何为良善所出自的邪恶在此所指的寻求功德的邪恶，就是人没有过错的那类邪恶，如前所述。但如果一成年，人就在思维上确认并完全信服他凭自己所行的良善配得救赎，那么现在所讨论的这种邪恶就会牢牢扎根在他里面，无法纠正。因为这种人索要主的东西，因而不接受不断从主所流入的良善；并且它一流入，他们就把它引到自己那里，引入他们的自我里面，从而玷污它。这些邪恶就是“偷”或窃取在正面意义上所表示的（<a href="2609.htm">2609</a>节）。</p>

Whether stolen by day or stolen by night. That this signifies the evil of self-merit in like manner, is evident from the signification of "stolen" or of "theft," as being the evil of self-merit. There 
is the evil of self-merit when a man ascribes good to himself, and supposes that it is from himself, and on this account desires to merit salvation. This evil is what is signified in the internal sense 
by "theft." But in regard to this evil, all who are being reformed at first suppose that good is from themselves, and therefore that by the good which they do they merit salvation; for their supposing 
that they merit salvation by the good which they do is the result of their supposing that the good is from themselves, for the one idea coheres with the other. But they who suffer themselves to be 
regenerated do not confirm this in their thought, or persuade themselves that it is so; but the idea is gradually dissipated. For so long as anyone is in the external man, as is the case with all in 
the beginning of their reformation, he cannot do otherwise than think so, because he thinks solely from his external man. But when the external man together with its concupiscences is being removed, 
and the internal man is beginning to work; that is, when the Lord flows in through the internal man with the light of intelligence, and thereby enlightens the external man; the man then begins to believe 
otherwise, and ascribes good not to himself, but to the Lord. From this it is plain what is here meant by that evil of self-merit through which comes good, in like manner as through the evil which 
is not of fault, concerning which above. But if when he has arrived at adult age a man confirms in his thought, and altogether persuades himself that he merits salvation by the good he does, the evil 
in question inheres radically, and cannot be amended. For such men claim to themselves that which is the Lord's, and thus do not receive the good which continually flows in from the Lord; but immediately 
on its flowing in, divert it to themselves, and into their own, and consequently defile it. These are the evils which in the proper sense are signified by "thefts" (see n. 2609). </p>

'That stolen by day and that stolen by night' means the evil of merit- seeking in a similar way. This is clear from the meaning of 'stolen' or theft as the evil of merit-seeking. The evil of merit-seeking 
exists when someone attributes good to himself and supposes that it originates in himself, and on that account wishes to merit salvation. This is the evil meant in the internal sense by 'theft'. 
But the situation with this evil is that at first all who are being reformed imagine that good originates in themselves and as a consequence that they merit salvation through the good which they perform. 
For the supposition that they merit salvation through the good which they perform is the outcome of their supposition that good originates in themselves, since the one supposition clings to the other. 
But people who allow themselves to be regenerated do not set their minds firmly in that way of thinking or convince themselves that such ideas are right. Instead these are gradually dispersed. Indeed 
as long as a person stays in the external man, as all do at the beginning of reformation, he inevitably thinks in that way. But he is thinking solely from the external man. </p>
<p></p>
<p><b>[2]</b>
 But when the external 
man together with its evil urges is being removed and the internal man is starting to be active, that is, when the Lord is flowing in through the internal man with the light of intelligence and 
by means of it giving light to the external man, that person starts to think in a different way and to attribute good not to himself but to the Lord. From this one may see what the evil of merit-seeking 
is, which is meant here by evil through which good comes - the kind of evil for which one is not blameworthy, dealt with already. But if, on reaching adult years, a person firmly establishes this 
evil in his thinking and becomes utterly convinced that he merits salvation through the good which he performs, that evil becomes strongly rooted in him and cannot be put right. For such people claim 
to themselves that which is the Lord's. So they are not receivers of good which flows in constantly from the Lord; for the moment this enters them they channel it into themselves and into their proprium, 
and in so doing they defile it. These evils are what are meant in the proper sense by 'thefts', see <a href="2609.htm">2609</a>. </p>

</p><b>4174.</b>
`Furatum die et furatum nocte': quod significet malum meriti similiter, constat ex significatione `furati' seu furti quod sit malum meriti: malum meriti est cum homo tribuit sibi bonum et autumat 
quod a se, ac ideo mereri vult salutem; hoc malum est quod in sensu interno significatur per `furtum' Sed cum hoc malo ita se habet: principio omnes qui reformantur, putant quod bonum sit a se, et 
inde quod per bonum quod faciunt, mereantur salutem; nam autumare quod per bonum quod faciunt, mereantur salutem, inde venit quod autument bonum esse a se, unum enim cohaeret cum altero; sed qui regenerari 
se patiuntur, non confirmant hoc cogitatione, aut sibi persuadent quod ita sit, sed successive dissipatur; quamdiu enim homo in externo homine est, ut sunt omnes in principio reformationis 
{3}, non potest aliter quam ita cogitare, at {2} cogitat solum ab externo homine; [2] sed {3} cum externus homo cum suis concupiscentiis removetur ac internus incipit operari, hoc est, cum Dominus 
per internum hominem influit cum luce intelligentiae ac illustrat inde externum hominem, tunc aliter credere incipit ac sibi bonum non tribuit, sed Domino; inde patet quid malum meriti, quod hic 
intelligitur per quod `bonum similiter', ac per malum non culpae, de quo prius. At vero si homo cum ad adultam aetatem pervenit, confirmat id cogitatione, et sibi prorsus persuadet quod mereatur per 
bonum quod facit, salutem, hoc malum radicitus haeret et non emendari potest, vindicant enim sibi id quod Domini est, et sic non recipiunt bonum quod continue influit a Domino, sed ilico cum influit, 
derivant id in se et in suum proprium, proinde id conspurcant: haec mala sunt quae in proprio sensu significantur per `furta,' videatur n. 2609.      @1 principio regenerationis$      @2 sed$
