<h3 align="center" class="ired">属天的奥秘 第4628节</h3>
<h4 align="center"></h4><p><strong>4628.</strong>我们继续说一下与觉知有关的气场所转化的气味，它们闻上去和地上的气味一样明显。但它们不会进入凡其内层已关闭之人的感官意识，因为它们通过一种内在途径，而非外在途径流入。这些气味有两个不同的源头，即对良善的觉知和对邪恶的觉知。来自对良善的觉知的这些源头最令人愉悦，极其甜蜜，仿佛从花园的芬芳花朵和其它芳香事物散发出来的，具有难以形容的愉悦性和多样化。天堂居民就生活在这类气味的气场中。<br />而来源于对邪恶的觉知的气味最令人厌恶。它们恶臭难闻，就像臭水、粪便、死尸发出的臭气，或老鼠和臭虫发出的恶臭。地狱居民就生活在诸如此类的恶臭气场中。来令人惊讶的是，住在其中的人却不觉得它们难闻。事实上，这些恶臭令他们感到快乐；当地狱居民处于其中时，他们就处在令他们欢喜快乐的气场中。但当地狱被打开，从它发出的呼气抵达善灵时，这些灵人就会产生恐惧和痛苦，就像世人遭遇了这类恶臭的气场那样。</p>

With regard further to the odors into which the spheres of perceptions are turned, they are smelt as plainly as are odors on earth, but do not reach the sense of the man whose interiors are closed; for 
they flow in by an internal, and not by an external, way. These odors are from a twofold origin-the perception of good and the perception of evil; those from the perception of good are as intensely 
sweet as though they exhaled from the fragrant flowers of a garden and other fragrant things, and are inexpressibly pleasant and various, and the angels of heaven are in the spheres of such odors; whereas 
the odors which are from the perception of evil are as intensely repulsive as are the stenches and putrid smells from stinking waters, excrements, and carcasses, or the filthy smell from mice and 
bedbugs. In the spheres of such stenches are they who are in hell, and wonderful to say they who are in them do not perceive their offensiveness, nay the stenches are delightful to them, and when they 
are in them, they are in the sphere of their delights. But when hell is opened, and the exhalation from it reaches good spirits, these are seized with horror and distress, like those in the world who 
encounter the sphere of such stenches. </p>

To continue what has been said about the odours into which spheres associated with perceptions are converted, one smells them as plainly as odours on earth. But they do not enter the sensory awareness 
of anyone whose interiors are closed, because they come in by an internal route, not by an external one. These odours have two different origins, namely the perception of good and the perception of 
evil. Those originating in the perception of good are most pleasing, being like the perfume from fragrant flowers in a garden, and from other fragrancies, and are indescribably lovely as well as various. 
Among odorous spheres such as these live the inhabitants of heaven. </p>
<p></p>
<p><b>[2]</b>
 But the odours which originate in the perception of evil are most displeasing. They are foul and stinking, like the reek 
of stinking waters, excrement, dead bodies, or people with the disgusting smell like that of mice or lice coming from them. Among malodorous spheres such as these live the inhabitants of hell. And what 
is astonishing, those living among them do not find them offensive. Indeed those foul smells are delightful to them, and when such exist the inhabitants of hell are within the sphere of things that 
give them joy and delight. But when hell is opened and the exhalation from it reaches good spirits, these are seized with horror and also distress, like those in the world who encounter the sphere of 
such stenches. </p>

</p><b>4628.</b>
Quod porro odores in quos vertuntur sphaerae perceptionum, attinet, sentiuntur illi tam manifeste sicut odores in terra, sed non perveniunt ad sensum hominis apud quem clausa sunt interiora, nam 
per viam internam influunt, non autem per externam.  Sunt odores illi ex duplici origine, nempe ex perceptione boni, et ex perceptione mali; qui ex perceptione boni sunt, sunt gratissimi, halantes 
quasi ex fragrantibus horti floribus, et ex aliis fragrantiis, tanta amoenitate, et quoque varietate ut ineffabile; </p>
<p>in talium odorum 2 sphaeris sunt illi qui in caelo; odores autem qui ex perceptione 
mali sunt, sunt ingratissimi, fetentes et putentes sicut qui ab aquis putidis, ab excrementis, a cadaveribus, et foede olentes sicut a muribus et pediculis domesticis; in talium nidorum sphaeris 
sunt illi qui in inferno: et quod mirum, ii qui in illis sunt, graveolentiam non sentiunt, immo putores illi eis delectabiles sunt, et cum in illis sunt, in {1}sphaera suorum jucundorum et deliciosorum 
sunt; at vero cum aperitur infernum, et exhalatio inde ad spiritus bonos {2}pervenit, corripiuntur hi horrore et quoque anxietate, sicut illi in mundo qui in sphaeram fetorum talium incidunt.  
    @1 suis jucundis et delitiosis$      @2 transit$ </p>
