<h3 align="center" class="ired">属天的奥秘 第2861节</h3>
<h4 align="center"></h4><p><strong>2861.</strong>“这些话以后”表涉及教会中人的那些事已经成就。这从“话”的含义清楚可知，“话”是指真实事物。真实事物的原义就被称为“话”，因此“这些话以后”表示这些事成就以后。在前文，从13节直至本节所论述的主题一直是属灵之人凭主的神性人得救，事实上，是教会中那些具有良善之人得救。他们才是那些能变得真正属灵的人，因为他们拥有圣言，从而拥有信之真理。人变得属灵所凭借的，正是与生命之善相联结的教义真理。一切属灵的品质皆源于此。但教会之外的外邦人由于没有圣言，因而没有信之真理，故只要活在人世，尽管具有仁之善，却仍不是真正属灵的，直到他们接受信之真理的教导。由于绝大多数外邦人在世时无法接受教导，故根据主的旨意和怜悯，那些过着彼此仁爱和顺从生活的人会在来世得到指教。到那时，他们很容易接受信之真理，并变得属灵。这就是外邦人在来世的状态和命运（参看<a href="2589.htm">2589</a>-<a href="2604.htm">2604</a>节）。<br />前文论述了那些教会中凭主的神性人得救的人，故下文直到本章结尾论述那些教会外的人。这些人由亚伯拉罕的兄弟拿鹤的妻子密迦和他的妾流玛给他生的儿子来表示。这也符合思维的顺序。人若不了解圣言的内义，会以为考虑到成为以撒妻子的利百加，还考虑到彼土利，他的两个孙女就是成为雅各妻子的利亚和拉结，这些话只是讲述了他拉的家谱。而事实上，如前面频繁阐述和说明的，圣言中所有名字都表示真实事物（<a href="1224.htm">1224</a>，<a href="1264.htm">1264</a>，<a href="1876.htm">1876</a>，<a href="1888.htm">1888</a>节）。若非它们表示这类事物，圣言就不是神圣的，而是世俗的。由此也清楚可知，接下来所讲述的这一系列的事涉及主的属灵教会，不过是外邦人当中的教会。该教会可追溯到亚伯拉罕的兄弟拿鹤那里，以便所表示的是那些凭良善而具有兄弟情谊的人，如下文所述（<a href="2863.htm">2863</a>节）。</p>

It came to pass after these words. That this signifies the things done relating to those who are within the church, is evident from the signification of "words," as being actual things. In the original 
language things are called "words;" and thus "after these words" means after the things done. In what precedes, from verse 13 to this verse, the salvation of the spiritual by the Lord's Divine Human 
is treated of, and indeed those who are in good within the church. These are they who can be truly spiritual, because they have the Word, and thus the truths of faith. By truths of doctrine conjoined 
with good of life, man becomes spiritual. All spiritual quality is from this. But the nations without the church, because they have not the Word, and thus not the truths of faith, so long as they live 
in the world, although in the good of charity, are still not truly spiritual until they have been instructed in the truths of faith. And as most of these nations cannot be instructed in the world, 
those who have lived in mutual charity and in obedience are of the Lord's providence and mercy instructed in the other life, and then receive the truths of faith easily, and become spiritual. (That the 
state and lot of these nations is such in the other life, may be seen above, n. 2589-2604.)  [2] As those within the church who are saved by the Lord's Divine Human are treated of in what precedes, 
in the things which follow to the end of this chapter those out of the church who are saved are treated of, and are signified by those who were born to Nahor, Abraham's brother, from Milcah his wife 
and Reumah his concubine: this also follows in the series. He who has not become acquainted with the internal sense of the Word would suppose that these things relate merely to the genealogy of the house 
of Terah, being given on account of Rebekah who became Isaac's wife, and also on account of Bethuel, whose two granddaughters, Leah and Rachel, became Jacob's wives. But as has been very often said 
and shown, all the names in the Word signify actual things (n. 1224, 1264, 1876, 1888); and unless they signified such things, the Word would not be Divine, but worldly. From this it is also evident 
that these things which follow relate in series to the Lord's spiritual church, but to that which is among the Gentiles; and this through Nahor, Abraham's brother, in order that those who are in brotherhood 
from good may be signified (as follows, n. 2863). </p>

That 'so it was, after these events' means the things that had been accomplished in regard to those within the Church is clear from the meaning of 'words' as real things. In the original language real 
things are called 'words', so that 'after these events' means the things that had been accomplished. The subject in what has gone before, from verse 13 to the present verse, has been the salvation of 
those who are spiritual by the Lord's Divine Human, and indeed of those who are endowed with good within the Church. These are ones who are able to be truly spiritual because they possess the Word and 
so the truths of faith. It is by means of the truths of doctrine joined to goodness of life that a person becomes spiritual. Everything spiritual originates in these when joined together. But gentiles 
outside the Church, because they do not possess the Word nor thus the truths of faith as long as they are in the world, even though the good of charity exists with them, are not truly spiritual until 
they have been taught the truths of faith. And because most gentiles in the world are not able to be taught, those who have led charitable and obedient lives one with another are, in the Lord's providence 
and mercy, taught in the next life. At that time they accept the truths of faith without difficulty and become spiritual. For such is the state and condition of gentiles in the next life, see <a href="2589.htm">2589</a>-<a href="2604.htm">2604</a>.  </p>

<p><b>[2]</b>
 Since those within the Church who are saved by the Lord's Divine Human have been the subject in what has gone before, the subject in what follows from here to the end of the chapter 
is therefore those outside the Church who are saved. These are meant by the sons who were born to Nahor, Abraham's brother, by Milkah his wife and by Reumah his concubine. This also follows in the sequence 
of thought. Anyone who is unacquainted with the internal sense of the Word would imagine that these words merely presented the family-tree of the house of Terah, given on account of Rebekah, who 
became the wife of Isaac, and also on account of Bethuel, whose two granddaughters, Leah and Rachel, became the wives of Jacob. But in fact, as has often been stated and shown, all names in the Word 
mean real things, <a href="1224.htm">1224</a>, <a href="1264.htm">1264</a>, <a href="1876.htm">1876</a>, <a href="1888.htm">1888</a>. And unless they meant real things the Word would not be Divine but worldly. From this it may also become clear that the words which follow have regard in the 
train of thought to the Lord's spiritual Church, but that Church as it exists among gentiles. It was traced back through Nahor, Abraham's brother, so as to mean those who exist in a brotherly relationship 
by virtue of good, as shown below in <a href="2863.htm">2863</a>. </p>

`Fuit post verba illa':  quod significet res transactas spectantes illos qui intra Ecclesiam, constat ex significatione `verborum' quod sint res; in lingua originali res dicuntur verba, ita `post verba 
illa' est post res transactas. Actum est in praecedentibus a vers. 13 ad hunc versum, de salvatione spiritualium ex Divino Humano Domini, et quidem illorum qui in bono intra Ecclesiam sunt; illi sunt 
qui vere spirituales possunt esse, quia Verbum habent, ita vera fidei; per vera doctrinae conjuncta bono vitae fit homo spiritualis; omne spirituale est inde:  gentes vero extra Ecclesiam quia Verbum 
non habent, ita non vera fidei, quamdiu in mundo vivunt, etiamsi in bono charitatis, usque non sunt vere spirituales antequam in veris fidei instructi {1}sunt; et quia pleraeque gentes in mundo instrui 
nequeunt, illi qui in charitate mutua et in oboedientia vixerunt, ex providentia et misericordia Domini in altera vita instruuntur, et tunc facile recipiunt vera fidei, et fiunt spirituales; quod 
gentium status et sors in altera vita talis sit, videatur n. 2589-2604.  Quia in {2}praecedentibus actum est de 2 illis qui salvantur ex Divino Humano Domini intra Ecclesiam, ideo in his quae sequuntur 
ad finem hujus capitis, agitur de illis qui salvantur extra Ecclesiam, et significantur per illos qui nati Nahori fratri Abrahami ex Milkah uxore et ex Reumah concubina; hoc etiam sequitur in serie; 
qui non sensum internum Verbi novit, putaret quod haec solum genealogica essent domus Terahi, propter Rebeccam quae facta Jishako uxor, ut et propter Bethuelem, cujus binae neptes Lea et Rachel factae 
uxores Jacobo; verum, ut saepius dictum et ostensum, omnia nomina in Verbo significant res, n. 1224, 1264, 1876, 1888; et nisi significarent res, Verbum non foret Divinum sed mundanum; inde etiam 
constare potest quod haec quae sequuntur, spectent in serie Ecclesiam spiritualem Domini, sed illam quae apud gentes est; et hoc per Nahorem fratrem Abrahami, ut significarentur illi qui in fraternitate 
sunt ex bono, ut sequitur n. 2863. @1 sint$ @2 antecedentibus$ </p>
