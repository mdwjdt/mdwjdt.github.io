Verses 37-40. And Jacob took him a fresh rod of poplar, and hazel, and plane-tree, and peeled white peelings on them, laying bare the white that was upon the rods. And he set the rods which he had peeled 
in the gutters, in the watering troughs, whither the flocks came to drink, over against the flocks; and they grew warm when they came to drink. And the flocks grew warm at the rods, and the flocks 
brought forth party-colored, speckled, and spotted. And Jacob separated the lambs, and set the faces of the flock toward the party-colored, and all the black in the flock of Laban; and he put for himself 
droves for himself alone, and put them not unto Laban's flock. "And Jacob took him a fresh rod of poplar," signifies the power proper to natural good; "and hazel, and plane-tree," signifies the 
derivative power of natural truths; "and peeled white peelings on them, laying bare the white that was upon the rods," signifies a disposition into order by the interior power of truth; "and he set the 
rods which he had peeled in the gutters," signifies further preparation; "in the watering troughs, whither the flocks came to drink," signifies the affections of truth; "over against the flocks; and 
they grew warm when they came to drink," signifies even to ardor of affection, that they might be conjoined; "and the flocks grew warm at the rods," signifies the effect from His own power; "and the 
flocks brought forth party-colored, speckled, and spotted," signifies that thereby natural good itself had such things from the mediate good signified by "Laban;" "and Jacob separated the lambs," signifies 
as to innocence; "and set the faces of the flock toward the party-colored," signifies to truths scattered over with evils and falsities; "and all the black," signifies to such a state; "in the flock 
of Laban," signifies in the good signified by "Laban;" "and he put for himself droves for himself alone," signifies the separation of the goods and truths by His own power; "and put them not unto 
Laban's flock," signifies absolute separation from the good signified by "Laban." </p>

Verses 37-40 And Jacob took for himself fresh rots of poplar, and hazel and plane, and stripped white strips on them - an exposing of the white which was on the rods. And he set the rods which he had 
stripped in runners, in the troughs of water where the flocks came to drink, in front of the flocks; and they came on heat as they came to drink. And the flocks came on heat at the rods, and the flocks 
brought forth variegated, speckled, and spotted ones. And Jacob singled out the lambs, and set the faces of the flock towards the variegated, and every black one in Laban's flock; and he put his own 
droves apart and did not put them near Laban's flock. </p>
<p>'Jacob took for himself fresh rods of poplar' means the power proper to natural good. 'And hazel and plane' means the power deriving from this 
which natural truths possess. 'And stripped white strips on them - an exposing of the white which was on the rods' means an ordering effected by the interior power of truth. 'And he set the rods which 
he had stripped in runners' means further preparation. 'In the troughs of water where the flocks came to drink' means affections for truth. 'In front of the flocks; and they came on heat as they came 
to drink' means even to the point of an intense desire in the affection for truth that a joining [to the goods and truths within the natural] might be effected. 'And the flocks were on heat at the 
roast means the effect produced by His own power. 'And the flocks brought forth variegated, speckled, and spotted ones' means that as a consequence natural good itself possessed such things, from the 
intermediate good meant by Laban. 'And Jacob singled out the lambs' means as regards innocence. 'And set the faces of the flock towards the variegated' means towards truths interspersed with evils and 
falsities. 'And every black one' means towards such a state. 'In Laban's flock' means within the good meant by Laban. 'And he put his own droves apart' means the separation of goods and truths by His 
own power. 'And did not put them near Laban's flock' means total separation from the good meant by Laban. </p>

Vers. 37-40.  Et accepit sibi Jacob baculum populi recentem, et corylum, et platanum, et decorticavit in illis decorticationes albas, denudationem albi, quod super baculis.  Et constituit baculos 
quos decorticavit, in canalibus, in potatoriis aquae, quo veniebant greges ad bibendum, e regione gregum, et incalescebant in veniendo illos ad bibendum.  Et incalescebant greges ad baculos, et pariebant 
greges variegatos, punctatos, et maculosos.  Et agnos separavit Jacob, et dedit facies gregis ad variegatum, et omne nigrum in grege Labanis, et posuit sibi catervas soli sibi, et non posuit 
eos ad gregem Labanis.  `Accepit sibi Jacob baculum populi recentem' significat propriam potentiam naturalis boni: `et corylum, et platanum' significat potentiam inde naturalium veritatum: `et decorticavit 
in illis decorticationes albas, denudationem albi quo super baculis' significat dispositionem veri interioris potentiae: `et constituit baculos quos decorticavit, in canalibus' significat 
praeparationem ulteriorem: `in potatoriis aquae quo veniebant greges ad bibendum' significat veri affectiones: `e regione gregum, et incalescebant in veniendo illos ad bibendum' significat usque 
ad affectionis ardorem ut conjungerentur: `et incalescebant greges ad baculos' significat effectum ex propria potentia: `et pariebant greges variegatos, punctatos et maculosos' significat quod inde 
ipsi naturali bono, ex bono medio significato per Labanem, talia: `et agnos separavit Jacob' significat quoad innocentiam: `et dedit facies gregis ad variegatum' significat ad vera sparsa malis et 
falsis: `et omne nigrum' significat ad statum talem: `in grege Labanis' significat in bono per Labanem significato, `et posuit sibi catervas soli sibi' significat separationem bonorum et verorum ex 
propria potentia: `et non posuit eos ad gregem Labanis' significat separationem absolutam a bono per Labanem significato. </p>
