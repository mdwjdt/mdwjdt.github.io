<h3 align="center" class="ired">属天的奥秘 第939节</h3>
<h4 align="center"></h4><p><strong>939.</strong>已然变得卑鄙贪婪之人的思想观念会转化为令人作呕的幻象。从他们的地狱就能清楚看出这幻象多么令人恶心。那地狱在脚底下的深处，从它散发出如猪鬃浸在热水槽中、然后被刮掉的猪身上所散发的那种蒸汽。贪婪者的居所就在此处。到这里来的人起初黑乎乎的，但象猪一样被剃光毛发后，则看似闪亮的白色。这就是此时他们在自己眼里的模样，不过，剃光之后仍会留下记号，以便他们无论到哪儿，人们都能知道他们本性。一个黑色精灵尚未被带入自己的地狱，因为他被要求在精灵界呆得时间长一点，于是就被下放到他们所在之处。他并不象其他人那样贪婪，然而他在有生之年却怀着嫉妒和邪恶贪求别人的财产。他一到那里，贪婪者就都逃走了，并声称他是一个强盗，因为他是黑色的，会杀了他们。贪婪者逃避这类精灵，因为他们特别害怕丧失性命。最后，他们得知他不是这种强盗，于是告诉他说，他若想变白，就必须象众目睽睽之下的猪一样除掉全身的毛发，那样他就会变白。但他不想这样，于是被带到精灵之中。</p>

<p><strong>[NCE]939.</strong> Evidence that the ideas composing the thoughts of sordid misers turn into sordid hallucinations can be seen in their hell, which is deep down under the feet. Out of it wafts a cloud of steam, like the steam from pigs being skinned in a trough. That is where misers' houses are. The people who go there are dark-looking at first, but when they have their hair scraped off, as pigs do, they seem to themselves and to each other to grow lighter in color.{*1} But the process still leaves a mark indicating that this is their nature, no matter where they go.<br />A dark-looking spirit who had not yet been shunted into his own hell (because he was to stay longer in the world of spirits) was sent down to that locale. He was not very miserly, but even so, while he lived he had harbored a malicious envy of others' wealth. When he arrived, the misers there ran away, saying that since he was dark, he was a robber and so would kill them. Misers flee such people in tremendous fear for their lives. Finally they discovered that he was not that lawless and told him that, if he wanted to turn lighter, all he had to do was to be stripped of his hair, as was happening to the pigs right there in plain view, and then his color would grow lighter. But he did not want this. He was taken up among the spirits.<br /><br /><strong>Footnotes:</strong><br />{*1} The reference to color is not racial here; see note 1 in <a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_939/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_814" target=_top>814</a>. The usual methods for debristling pigs after slaughter included burning the bristles off in a very hot and quickly spent fire of dry tinder, and brushing away the ashes; or scalding the pig and scraping off the bristles. See Hartley 1979, 226-227. [JSR, SS] </p>

What sordid phantasies the ideas of thought of those who have been sordidly avaricious are turned into, is evident from their hell, which is deep under foot. A vapor exhales from it like that from hogs 
whose bristles are being scraped off in a scalding trough. There are the homes of the avaricious. Those who come thither at first appear black, but by the scraping off of their hair, as is done with 
hogs, they seem to themselves to become white. So they then appear to themselves, but still there remains therefrom a mark by which they are known wherever they go. A certain black spirit who had not 
yet been brought to his own hell, because he had to make a longer stay in the world of spirits, being let down thither (although he had not been so avaricious as the rest, and yet had in his lifetime 
wickedly panted for the wealth of others), on his arrival the avaricious there fled away, saying that he was a robber, because he was black, and would kill them. For the avaricious flee from such spirits, 
being especially fearful of losing their lives. At length, having found out that he was not such a robber, they told him that if he wished to become white he merely had to have the hair taken off, 
like the swine-which were in full view-and then he would be white. But as he did not desire this, he was taken up among spirits. </p>

The ideas comprising the thought of people who have been disgustingly avaricious are converted into disgusting delusions. How disgusting is clear from their hell, which is deep down underfoot. A steamy 
vapour exudes from it like that coming from pigs whose bristles are being scraped off in a trough [of hot water]. It is here that the greedy have their dwelling-places. At first the appearance of those 
who enter that place is black. But then on being shaven like pigs they seem to themselves to become shining white. This is how they appear to themselves at this point, but a mark is nevertheless 
left after shaving to indicate their true character wherever they go. A certain black spirit who had not yet been taken down into his own hell because he was required to stay on longer in the world of 
spirits was sent down to where they were. He had not been so avaricious a person, but nevertheless during his lifetime he had gazed with envy and evil intent at other people's wealth. As he drew near, 
the avaricious people there fled, saying that as he was black he was a robber who, being such, would murder them. For the avaricious flee from such people, fearing greatly for their own lives. At length 
however they learned that he was no such robber and they then told him that if he wished to become shining white he had merely to get rid of the hair covering him, like the pigs which were in full 
view, and he would then be shining white. But he did not wish to, and so he was taken up to be among spirits. </p>

</p><b>939.</b>
Ideae cogitationis eorum qui sordide avari fuerunt, in phantasias quam sordidis vertantur, constat ab eorum inferno, quod sub pedibus profunde; vapor inde exhalat sicut vapor ex suibus excoriatis in 
canali; ibi sunt avarorum domicilia: qui illuc veniunt, primum atri apparent, et ibi per pilorum derasionem, sicut solent sues, candidi sibi fieri videntur; ita quoque sibi tunc apparent; sed usque manet 
inde nota quod tales sint ubicumque veniunt.  Quidam spiritus niger, qui nondum in infernum suum delatus quia adhuc moraturus in mundo spirituum, illuc demissus, qui non ita avarus fuerat, sed usque 
dum vixit, malitiose aliorum opibus inhiaverat, quo alluente avari ibi aufugiebant, dicentes quod latro, quia niger, et sic eos necaret; avari enim fugiunt tales quia maxime timent vitae; tandem comperti, 
quod non talis latro, dicebant ei, si candidus vellet fieri, modo ei pili, sicut suibus qui in conspectu visi, detraherentur, sic candesceret; sed hoc non voluit; inter spiritus sublatus est. </p>
