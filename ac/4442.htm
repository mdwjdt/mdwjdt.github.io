<h3 align="center" class="ired">属天的奥秘 第4442节</h3>
<h4 align="center"></h4><p><strong>4442.</strong>“示剑的父亲哈抹出来，到雅各那里，要和他讲话”表商议这个教会的真理。这从“示剑的父亲哈抹”和“雅各”的代表，以及“和他讲话”的含义清楚可知：“示剑的父亲哈抹”是指古人所知的真理（参看<a href="4430.htm">4430</a>，<a href="4431.htm">4431</a>节）；“雅各”是指外在的古教会（<a href="4439.htm">4439</a>节）；“和他讲话”是指商议。因此，这些话表示商议这个教会的真理。人若不知道在圣言中，名字表示属灵的实体，必惊讶“示剑的父亲哈抹出来，到雅各那里，要和他讲话”这些话居然表示存在于古人当中的教会真理与适合要在雅各后代当中重新建立的古教会的真理所进行的商议。但是，凡了解圣言内义性质的人，都不会感到惊讶；事实上，那些从古人的书籍了解他们写作风格的人也不会感到惊讶。因为古人在阐述实体时，习惯将其表现得如同彼此交谈，如智慧，聪明，知识等。他们还习惯给这些实体取名字，以名字来表示这类事物。古人的神明或半神不是别的，他们所杜撰出来，并以历史故事的形式与这些实体联在一起的风云人物也不是别的。<br />古代哲人从古教会那里接受了这种习俗，古教会曾传遍亚洲世界（<a href="1238.htm">1238</a>，<a href="2385.htm">2385</a>节）；因为古教会的人通过代表和有意义的符号来阐述神圣事物。然而，古教会是从生活在大洪水之前的上古之人的口述接受了这个习俗（<a href="920.htm">920</a>，<a href="1409.htm">1409</a>，<a href="1977.htm">1977</a>，<a href="2896.htm">2896</a>，<a href="2897.htm">2897</a>节）；而这些人则从天上接受它，因为他们与天堂交流（<a href="784.htm">784</a>，<a href="1114.htm">1114</a>-<a href="1125.htm">1125</a>节）。这类代表和有意义的符号就出现在第一层天堂，也就是三层天堂中最低层的那一个。这解释了为何圣言以这种风格写就。不过，与古人的着作不同的是，圣言有这样一个独特的特点，即：在一个连续系列中的独立实体代表主国度的属天和属灵事物，在至高意义上则代表主自己；真实的历史细节也是如此；更重要的是，它们是真实的对应关系，这些是连续的，贯穿于源自主的三层天堂。</p>

And Hamor the father of Shechem went out unto Jacob to speak with him. That this signifies a consultation about the truth of that church, is evident from the representation of Hamor the father of Shechem, 
as being the truth of the ancients (see n. 4430, 4431); from the representation of Jacob, as being the external Ancient Church (n. 4439); and from the signification of "speaking with him," as being 
to consult. Hence by these words is signified a consultation about the truth of that church. [2] He who does not know that names in the Word signify things, will wonder that by the words "Hamor the 
father of Shechem went out unto Jacob to speak with him," is signified a consultation of the truth of the church that existed among the ancients with the truth that was in accordance with the Ancient 
Church that was to be set up anew among the descendants of Jacob; but this will excite no surprise in anyone who knows that such is the nature of the internal sense of the Word, nor in those who have 
learned from the books of the ancients their manner of writing; for it was customary with them to set forth things as speaking together, such as wisdom, intelligence, knowledges, and the like; and 
also to give them names by which such things were signified. The gods and demigods of the ancients were nothing else, and so were the personages whom they devised in order to present their subjects in 
a historical form.  [3] The sages of old took this custom from the Ancient Church, which was spread over much of the Asiatic world (n. 1238, 2385); for the people of the Ancient Church set forth sacred 
things by means of representatives and significatives. The Ancient Church, however, received this from the mouth of the Most Ancient people, who were before the flood (n. 920, 1409, 1977, 2896, 2897); 
and these from heaven, for they had communication with heaven (n. 784, 1114-1125); and the first heaven, which is the last of the three, is in such representatives and significatives. This is the 
reason why the Word was written in such a style. But the Word has this peculiar feature, not possessed by the writings of the ancients, that each of the subjects in a continuous series represents the 
celestial and spiritual things of the Lord's kingdom, and in the supreme sense the Lord Himself; even the historicals themselves being of the same character; and-what is more-they are real correspondences, 
and these continuous through the three heavens from the Lord. </p>

'And Hamor, Shechem's father, went out to Jacob to speak to him' means consultation regarding the truth of that Church. This is clear from the representation of 'Hamor, Shechem's father' as the truth 
known to the Ancients, dealt with in <a href="4430.htm">4430</a>, <a href="4431.htm">4431</a>; from the representation of 'Jacob' as the external Ancient Church, dealt with just above in <a href="4439.htm">4439</a>; and from the meaning of 'speaking to him' as consultation. 
Consequently these words mean consultation regarding the truth of that Church. Anyone who does not know that names in the Word mean spiritual entities will be amazed to learn that these words 'Hamor, 
Shechem's father, went out to Jacob to speak to him' mean consultation by the truth of the Church among the Ancients with the truth which was suited to the Ancient Church that was to be established 
among Jacob's descendants. But no one who knows what the internal sense of the Word is like will be amazed; nor indeed will those who from books by the Ancients have acquainted themselves with the 
literary style customary among them. For the Ancients commonly presented entities as if conversing with one another, such as wisdom, intelligence, knowledge, and the like. They also commonly gave these 
entities names by which such things were meant. The gods and demigods of the people of old were nothing other, and neither were the personalities whom they invented to link those entities together 
into a historical tale.  </p>

 The philosophers of old received this customary style from the Ancient Church which had been spread throughout much of the Asiatic world, <a href="1238.htm">1238</a>, <a href="2385.htm">2385</a>; for those who belonged 
to the Ancient Church linked together entities that were holy by means of representatives and meaningful signs. The Ancient Church however received the same by word of mouth from the most ancient 
people who lived before the Flood, <a href="920.htm">920</a>, <a href="1409.htm">1409</a>, <a href="1977.htm">1977</a>, <a href="2896.htm">2896</a>, <a href="2897.htm">2897</a>; and these people received it from heaven since they had communication with heaven, <a href="784.htm">784</a>, <a href="1114.htm">1114</a>-<a href="1125.htm">1125</a>. For such representatives and meaningful 
signs occur in the first heaven, which is the lowest of the three heavens. This explains why the Word was written in that kind of style. But in contrast to the writings of the men of old the Word 
has this peculiar feature, that the separate entities in a continuous chain represent the celestial and spiritual things of the Lord's kingdom, and in the highest sense the Lord Himself; that the actual 
historical details are also such; and what is more, that they are real correspondences, these being continuous, extending through the three heavens from the Lord. </p>

`Et exivit Hamor pater Shechemi ad Jacobum ad loquendum cum eo': quod significet consultationem de vero Ecclesiae illius, constat ex repraesentatione `Hamoris patris Shechemi' quod sit antiquorum 
verum, de qua n. 4430, 4431; ex repraesentatione `Jacobi' quod sit Ecclesia Antiqua externa, de qua mox supra n. 4439; et ex significatione `loqui cum eo' quod sit consultare; inde per illa verba 
significatur consultatio de vero Ecclesiae illius.  Qui non scit quod nomina in Verbo significent res, mirabitur quod per haec verba, `Exivit Hamor pater Shechemi ad Jacobum ad loquendum cum eo' significetur 
consultatio veri Ecclesiae apud antiquos cum vero quod secundum Ecclesiam {1} Antiquam apud posteros Jacobi instaurandam; sed non mirabitur, qui scit quod talis sensus internus Verbi sit; 
(o)ne quidem illi qui(n) morem scribendi apud antiquos ex libris eorum sibi notum fecerant; </p>
<p>commune enim fuerat apud illos introducere res quasi colloquentes, ut sapientiam, intelligentiam, scientias, 
et similia; et quoque indere illis nomina per quae talia significabantur; veterum dii et semidei non aliud fuerunt, et quoque personae quas finxerunt ut res historice concinnarent: [2] veteres 
sophi hunc morem tulerunt ab Antiqua Ecclesia, quae per multum orbis Asiatici dispersa fuit, n. 1238, 2385; nam qui ab Ecclesia Antiqua {2} fuerunt, res sacras per repraesentativa et significativa 
concinnarunt; Antiqua autem Ecclesia hoc tulit ex ore antiquissimorum qui ante diluvium, n. 920, 1409, 1977, 2896, 2897; et hi a caelo, nam communicationem cum caelo habuerunt, n. 784, 1114-1125; 
primum enim caelum, quod est ultimum trium, in talibus repraesentativis et significativis est; </p>
<p>inde est quod Verbum tali stilo conscriptum sit; sed Verbum prae veterum scriptis hoc peculiare habet 
quod singulae res in continua serie repraesentent caelestia et spiritualia regni Domini ac in supremo sensu Ipsum Dominum; et quod ipsa historica etiam talia sint; et quod magis, quod reales correspondentiae 
sint, et hae continuae per tres caelos a Domino.      @1 Ecclesiae quae secundum$      @2 illa$ </p>
