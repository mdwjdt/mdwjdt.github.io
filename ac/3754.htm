<h3 align="center" class="ired">属天的奥秘 第3754节</h3>
<h4 align="center"></h4><p><strong>3754.</strong>此前几节论述了教会中败坏良善与真理的三个状态；现在这几节则论述了第四个状态，也就是最后状态。第一个状态出现于人们开始不再知道何为良善与真理，而是针对良善与真理彼此争论，虚假由此产生之时（<a href="3354.htm">3354</a>节）。第二个状态出现于人们开始蔑视良善与真理，也开始厌恶拒绝它们，因而对主的信即将气绝，并且这一切照着仁爱即将不存在的程度而逐步发生之时（<a href="3487.htm">3487</a>，<a href="3488.htm">3488</a>节）。第三个状态出现于教会中的良善与真理被荒废之时（<a href="3651.htm">3651</a>，<a href="3652.htm">3652</a>节）。我们现在论述的这第四个状态出现于良善与真理遭到亵渎之时。此处描述了这个状态，这一事实从如下内义上的所有细节可以看出来。 </p>

In the preceding verses there were treated of three states of the perversion of good and truth in the church; and in the present verses a fourth state is treated of, which is also the last. Concerning 
the first state it was shown that it was that men began no longer to know what was good and true, but disputed among themselves concerning good and truth, whence came falsities (n. 3354). Concerning 
the second state, that it was that men began to despise good and truth, and also to hold them in aversion, and thus that faith in the Lord was about to expire, according to the degrees in which charity 
was about to cease (n. 3487, 3488). Concerning the third state, that it was a state of desolation of the church in respect to good and truth (n. 3651, 3652). Concerning the fourth state, we are now 
to show that it is that of the profanation of good and truth. That this state is here described, may be seen from all the particulars in the internal sense, which is as follows. </p>

In the verses prior to these the subject was three states of the perversion within the Church of what is good and true, and the subject now is a fourth state, which is also the last. The first state 
exists when people cease to know any longer what good is or what truth is, but begin to argue with one another about these, as a result of which, falsities arise, see <a href="3354.htm">3354</a>. The second state exists when 
they treat good and truth with contempt and also reject them, and so when belief in the Lord breathes its last, which things take place step by step as charity ceases to exist, see <a href="3487.htm">3487</a>, <a href="3488.htm">3488</a>. The third 
state exists when good and truth in the Church are made desolate, see <a href="3651.htm">3651</a>, <a href="3652.htm">3652</a>. Now in this present section the fourth state is dealt with, which exists when good and truth are made profane. The 
fact that the present section describes that state may be seen from each detail in the internal sense, which is as follows. </p>

In illis quae praecedunt, actum est de tribus statibus perversionis boni et veri in Ecclesia, hic nunc agitur de quarto statu, qui etiam est ultimus; de primo statu, quod fuerit quod non amplius 
inciperent scire quid bonum et quid verum, sed de illis litigarent inter se, a quibus falsitates, videatur n. 3354: de secundo statu, quod fuerit quod bonum et verum contempturi, et quoque quod aversaturi, 
et sic quod exspiratura fides in Dominum, secundum gradus sicut cessatura charitas, videatur n. 3487, 3488: </p>
<p>de tertio statu, quod fuerit desolationis Ecclesiae quoad bonum et verum, videatur 
n. 3651, 3652: de quarto statu hic nunc agitur, qui est profanationis boni et veri; quod ille status hic describatur, constare potest (c)a singulis ibi in sensu interno, qui talis est. </p>
