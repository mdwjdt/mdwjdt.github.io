<h3 align="center" class="ired">属天的奥秘 第443节</h3>
<h4 align="center"></h4><p><strong>443.</strong>在来生（即灵界），对于在世时关于灵魂、灵以及死后生活的观念，人们会被赋予一种清晰的觉察力。因为当他们被保持在仿佛仍处于肉身的状态时，其想法与肉身生活时的相似。这种想法会被清楚地传出来，就象把它大声说出来一样。有一次，我觉察到一个离世不久的人一如他自己所承认的，的确相信灵的存在，不过却以为灵死后必定过着一种朦胧的生活，因为若肉体生命退离，就只剩模糊和朦胧；他原以为生命只在肉体里面，因而灵是一个幽灵；他确信这种观念是因为他看到野兽和人类一样，也有生命。如今，他十分震惊地发现，灵和天使居然生活在最明亮的光中，生活在最大的聪明智慧和幸福快乐中，伴随着完美到无法言表的觉察力；因此他们的生活非但不朦胧，反而是最完美的明亮清晰。</p>

<p><strong>[NCE]443.</strong> Several Examples from Spirits of Opinions They Adopted during Their Physical Lives Concerning the Soul or Spirit<br />IN the other life it is easy to tell what opinions others held during bodily life concerning the soul, the spirit, and life after death. When people are kept in a state like the one they had in the body, they think the same way they did then, and their thinking is communicated as clearly as if they were talking out loud.<br />In the case of one spirit{*1} who had departed this world not long before, I perceived — and he admitted — that although he believed he would live on as a spirit, he expected to live a vague kind of life. His thinking, since he located life in the body, was that if physical life were withdrawn, only a vague something-or-other would remain. So his picture of the spirit was like that of a ghost. The observation that brute animals too had life, almost as people do, had confirmed him in his opinion. But now he was amazed to see that spirits and angels live in the greatest possible light and in the greatest possible intelligence, wisdom, and happiness, with such keen perception that it can hardly be described. Far from living a dim kind of life, he discovered, they live a clear and intensely vivid life.<br /><br /><strong>Footnotes:</strong><br />{*1} This person is identified as a man named Dippel in Swedenborg's Spiritual Experiences (Swedenborg 1998-2002) <a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_443/swedenborg_spiritual-experiences-odhner_3890" target=_top>3890</a>, where the same story is told. This Dippel is almost certainly Johann Konrad Dippel (1673-1734), a physician and radical Pietist who wrote works critical of the Protestant clergy under the name "Christianus Democritus" (see Tafel 1877, 1138-1139).

SOME EXAMPLES DRAWN FROM EXPERIENCE WITH SPIRITS CONCERNING WHAT THEY HAD THOUGHT DURING THEIR LIFE IN THE BODY ABOUT THE SOUL OR SPIRIT. In the other life it is given to perceive clearly what opinions 
people had entertained while they lived in the body concerning the soul, the spirit, and the life after death; for when kept in a state resembling that of the body they think in the same way, and 
their thought is communicated as plainly as if they spoke aloud. In the case of one person, not long after his decease, I perceived (what he himself confessed) that he had indeed believed in the existence 
of the spirit, but had imagined that it must live after death an obscure kind of life, because if the life of the body were withdrawn there would remain nothing but what is dim and obscure; for he 
had regarded life as being in the body, and therefore he had thought of the spirit as being a phantom; and he had confirmed himself in this idea from seeing that brutes also have life, almost as men 
have it. He now marveled that spirits and angels live in the greatest light, and in the greatest intelligence, wisdom, and happiness, attended with a perception so perfect that it can scarcely be described; 
consequently that their life, so far from being obscure, is most perfectly clear and distinct. </p>

SOME EXAMPLES OF WHAT CERTAIN SPIRITS HAD THOUGHT DURING THEIR LIFETIME ABOUT THE SOUL OR SPIRIT    In the next life one is enabled to have a clear perception of the opinions which people have held 
during their lifetime about the soul, about the spirit, and about life after death; for when they are kept in a state as though they were still in the body their thought is similar to what it had been 
in the body. And such thought is communicated just as plainly as if they uttered it aloud. On one occasion I perceived from someone who had departed the earthly life only a little while before that 
- as he himself admitted - he had indeed believed in the existence of the spirit, but that as a spirit he would be leading a shadowy existence. His reason far believing this was that if the life of the 
body were withdrawn nothing would be left apart from something shadowy. Indeed he focused life in the body; consequently his idea of the spirit was of a phantom. And he confirmed this idea in himself 
from seeing that animals also possessed life that was virtually the same as human beings. Now however he was amazed to see that spirits and angels dwelt in the greatest light, and in the greatest intelligence, 
wisdom, and happiness, accompanied by perception such as almost defied description. So their life is very far from being shadowy, but is bright and very clearly discernible.  </p>

Exempla quaedam a Spiritibus, quid cogitaverint in            vita corporis de Anima aut Spiritu </p>
<p>In altera vita manifeste percipere datur quas opiniones habuerint, cum vixerunt in corpore, 
de anima, de spiritu, de vita post mortem; nam cum tenentur in statu quasi essent in corpore, tunc similiter cogitant, et cogitatio tam perspicue communicatur ac si aperte loquerentur.  A quodam qui 
ante paucum tempus decesserat, percepi, quod etiam fassus, quod quidem crediderit spiritum, sed quod victurus vitam obscuram, ex causa, si abstraheretur vita corporis, quod remaneret obscurum quid; posuit 
enim in corpore vitam; quare habuit ideam de spiritu sicut de larva; seque confirmavit ex eo quod viderit bruta quoque vitam habere paene sicut homines; miratus nunc quod spiritus et angeli in summa 
luce vivant, in summa intelligentia, sapientia et felicitate, cum tali perceptione ut vix describi queat; ita minime in vita obscura sed in clara et distinctissima. </p>
