<h3 align="center" class="ired">属天的奥秘 第9577节</h3>
<h4 align="center"></h4><p><strong>9577.</strong>“在山上给你看的”表在天堂用灵眼看见的。这从“看”和“西乃山”的含义清楚可知：“说”当论及天堂里的代表时，是指用灵眼看见，如下文所述；“西乃山”是指天堂（参看<a href="8805.htm">8805</a>，<a href="9420.htm">9420</a>节）。至于“看”论及出现在天堂的代表时，是指用灵眼来看，要知道，住在最低层或第一层天堂的天使灵不断看见事物的样式或形式，类似存在于世上的那类事物。例如他们看见园子，园子里的树及其果实；鲜花和植物；以及房屋、宫殿，多种多样的动物；除此之外还有不计其数的其它事物，都是世上不曾见过的。所有这些景象都是存在于高层天堂中的天堂事物的代表。这些事物在第一层天堂就以这种形式或样式呈现在下面的灵人眼前，以便天使灵能从中知道并洞察存在于高层天堂中的特定事物；因为一切事物，甚至最小的细节，都是代表，并具有灵义。由此可见当如何理解约柜、基路伯、居所，那里的桌子，灯台所表示的天堂和天堂事物的代表。<br />世人用肉眼是看不见这类景象的，因为肉眼的形成是为了接受尘世和肉体的形状，因而接受物质事物。因此，肉眼是如此的不完美，以致它甚至无法用其视觉看清自然界中的秘密或内在事物；这一点从放大镜足以清楚看出来，因为只是看看自然界中隐藏至深的秘密，就需要提供放大镜。简言之，肉眼是极其迟钝、昏暗的，并且具有这种性质：它们绝无可能看见在来世显现给灵人的代表。若要使它们显现，必须将世界之光从肉眼前除去，然后才能看见那些存在于天堂之光中的事物。因为既有天堂之光，也有世界之光；天堂之光是为了人的灵而存在的，世界之光是为了人的肉身而存在的。此处的情形是这样：当一个人凭世界之光来观看那些存在于天堂之光中的事物时，这些事物就会陷入幽暗；相反，当一个人凭天堂之光来观看那些存在于世界之光中的事物时，这些事物也会陷入幽暗。正因如此，当把世界之光从肉眼的视觉前除去时，他的灵眼就开了，并看见那些存在于天堂之光中的事物，因此，代表形式或样式，如前所述，也就被看见了。由此可知为何当今世人在天堂的事上陷入幽暗，又为何有些人陷入的黑暗如此之大，以致他们甚至不信死后生命的存在，也不信他们将要活到永远。因为当今的世人如此沉浸于肉身，因而沉浸于肉体、尘世和世俗的事物，从而沉浸于如此不完美的世界之光中，以致天堂事物对他们来说，是完全、彻底的黑暗；因此，他们灵的视觉无法被光照。由此明显可知为何摩西在西乃山上看见帐幕的样式，是用灵眼来看的。<br />星空中的诸星球—我在那里所看见的第一个星球</p>

Which thou wast made to see in the mountain. That this signifies which were seen in heaven with the eyes of the spirit, is evident from the signification of "seeing," when said of the representatives 
in heaven, as being to see with the eyes of the spirit (of which in what follows); and from the signification of "Mount Sinai," as being heaven (see n. 8805, 9420). With regard to the fact that "to see," 
when said of the representatives that appear in heaven, denotes to see with the eyes of the spirit, be it known that the angelic spirits, who are in the ultimate or first heaven, constantly see forms 
of things like those which are in the world, such as paradises, trees therein with their fruits; flowers and plants; also houses, palaces, and likewise animals of many kinds; besides countless other 
things which are not seen in the world. All these things are representatives of the heavenly things in the higher heavens, and which in the first heaven are so presented in a form before the eyes 
of the spirits below, that an angelic spirit can know and perceive from them everything that is coming-forth in the higher heavens; for all things, down to the smallest particulars, are representative 
and significative. From this it can be seen what is meant by the representative of heaven and of the heavenly things which are signified by the ark, the cherubs, the Habitation, the table therein, and 
the lampstand.  [2] Such things cannot be seen by the eyes of a man, so long as he is in the world, for these eyes have been formed to receive earthly and bodily, thus material things. They are therefore 
so gross that they cannot even compass with their vision the interior things of nature, as can be well enough seen from the lenses they need to be furnished with in order to see merely those things 
of interior nature that are nearest to them. In a word, these eyes are most dull, and being such, the representatives which appear to spirits in the other life cannot possibly be seen by them; and 
if they are to appear, the light of the world must be taken away from the eyes, and then the things which are in the light of heaven may be seen. For there is a light of heaven, and there is a light 
of the world. The light of heaven is for the spirit of man, and the light of the world is for his body. The case herein is as follows. The things that are in the light of heaven are in thick darkness 
so long as a man sees from the light of the world; and, conversely, the things that are in the light of the world are in thick darkness when a man sees from the light of heaven. From this it is that 
when the light of the world is taken away from the sight of the bodily eye, the eyes of the man's spirit are opened, and those things are seen which are in the light of heaven; thus, as before said, the 
representative forms. [3] From all this it can be known why it is that at the present day men are in thick darkness concerning heavenly things, and why some are in darkness so great that they do not 
even believe that there is a life after death, nor that they will live forever. For at the present day man is so immersed in the body, thus in bodily, earthly, and worldly things, and is consequently 
in so gross a light of the world, that heavenly things are absolute thick darkness to him and therefore the sight of his spirit cannot be enlightened. From all this it is now evident what it is to 
see with those eyes of the spirit with which Moses saw the form of the Tent on Mount Sinai. </p>

'Which you were given to see on the mountain' means which were seen in heaven with the eyes of the spirit. This is clear from the meaning of 'seeing', when it has reference to representatives in heaven, 
as seeing with the eyes of the spirit, dealt with below; and from the meaning of Mount Sinai as heaven, dealt with in <a href="8805.htm">8805</a>, <a href="9420.htm">9420</a>. The fact that 'seeing', when it has reference to representatives which 
make their appearance in heaven, means seeing with the eyes of the spirit may be recognized from the consideration that angelic spirits, who inhabit the lowest or first heaven, constantly see patterns 
or forms of things similar to such objects as exist in the world. They see for instance parks, trees there with fruit on them, flowers, and young plants, also houses and palaces, as well as very 
many kinds of living creatures, in addition to countless other things that have not been seen in the world. All those sights are representatives of heavenly realities that exist in higher heavens. These 
realities there manifest themselves in such a form or pattern before the eyes of the spirits below, in order that from it an angelic spirit may be able to know about and gain an insight into particular 
realities that come to exist in higher heavens; for all things, even the most specific, are representative and carry a spiritual meaning. All this makes clear what should be understood by a representative 
of heaven and heavenly realities, which are meant by the ark, cherubs, dwelling-place, tables there, and lampstand.  </p>
<p></p>
<p><b>[2]</b>
 Such sights cannot be seen with the human eye in the world, for the 
eye has been formed to take in earthly and bodily shapes, thus material objects. The eye therefore is so imperfect that with its vision it cannot even take in the secrets of the natural order, as magnifying 
glasses go to prove, since it must be supplied with these if it is to see merely the least hidden secrets of the natural order. In short, the eyes are extremely dim, and being like this they 
cannot possibly see the representatives which make their appearance to spirits in the next life. If these are to make their appearance the inferior light of the world must be taken away from the eyes; 
and once it has been taken away those things that exist in the light of heaven are seen. For there is the light of heaven and there is the light of the world; the light of heaven exists for a person's 
spirit and the light of the world for a person's body. The situation is that those things which exist in the light of heaven are in thick darkness when a person looks at them from the light of the 
world, and conversely those things which exist in the light of the world are in thick darkness when a person looks at them from the light of heaven. So it is that when the light of the world is taken 
away from the sight of his physical eye the eyes of his spirit are opened, and those things which exist in the light of heaven, thus representative forms or patterns, are seen, as has been stated above. 
 </p>
<p></p>
<p><b>[3]</b>
 From all this it may recognized why it is that people at the present day are in thick darkness so far as heavenly matters are concerned. Some are in darkness so thick that they do not even 
believe in the existence of life after death, nor therefore that they are going to be alive for evermore. For people at the present day are immersed so much in the body, thus in bodily, earthly, and worldly 
concerns, and consequently in the light of the world which is so imperfect, that heavenly things are complete and utter darkness to them, and therefore the sight of their spirit cannot be enlightened. 
All this now shows what is meant by seeing with the eyes of the spirit, the eyes with which Moses saw the pattern of the tent on Mount Sinai.  </p>

`Quam tu videre factus es in monte': quod significet quae oculis spiritus visa sunt in caelo, constat ex significatione `videre' cum de repraesentativis in caelo, quod sit videre oculis spiritus, de 
qua sequitur, et ex significatione `montis Sinai' quod sit caelum, de qua n. 8805, 9420. Quod videre, cum de repraesentativis quae in caelo apparent, sit videre oculis spiritus, sciendum quod spiritus 
angelici, qui in ultimo seu primo caelo sunt, continue videant formas rerum similes talibus quae sunt in mundo, sicut paradisos, arbores ibi cum fructibus, flores et plantas, tum domos, palatia, ut 
et animalia plurium generum, praeter innumera alia quae in mundo non visa; omnia illa sunt repraesentativa rerum caelestium quae in superioribus caelis; haec ibi sistuntur in forma ita coram oculis spirituum 
infra, ut spiritus angelicus inde scire et percipere possit singula quae in caelis superioribus existunt, nam omnia quoad singularissima repraesentant et significant inde constare potest quid 
intelligitur per repraesentativum caeli et caelestium, quae per arcam, cherubos, habitaculum, mensas ibi, et candelabrum, significantur. 	2 Talia non possunt videri oculis hominis dum in mundo est, nam 
illi formati sunt ad capienda terrestria et corporea, ita materialia; sunt ideo tam crassi ut ne quidem possint capere visu interiora naturae, ut satis constare potest ex vitris opticis, per quae armandi 
sunt, ut solum illa quae proxime interioris naturae sunt videant; verbo, sunt maxime hebetes, et quia tales, nequaquam per illos videri possunt repraesentativa quae apparent spiritibus in altera 
vita; sed si apparitura sint, auferendum erit oculis lumen mundi, quo ablato videntur illa quae in luce caeli; est enim lux caeli et est lux mundi, lux caeli est pro spiritu hominis, et lux mundi pro 
corpore ejus; et res ita se habet: illa quae in luce caeli sunt, in caligine sunt quando homo ex luce mundi videt, et vice versa, illa quae in luce mundi sunt, in caligine sunt quando homo ex luce caeli 
videt; inde est [quod] cum lux mundi visui oculi corporei aufertur, tunc aperiantur oculi spiritus ejus, et videantur quae in luce caeli, ita formae repraesentativae, ut supra dictum est. 	3 Ex 
his sciri potest unde est quod homo hodie in caligine de caelestibus sit, et quidam in tanta ut ne quidem credant dari vitam post mortem, ita non se victurum in aeternum; est enim homo hodie tantum immersus 
corpori, ita corporeis, terrestribus, et mundanis, et inde in tam crassa luce mundi, ut caelestia ei prorsus caligo sint, et ideo visus ejus spiritus non illustrari possit. Ex his nunc patet quod 
sit videre oculis spiritus, quibus Moscheh vidit formam tentorii in monte Sinai. </p>
