<h3 align="center" class="ired">属天的奥秘 第3388节</h3>
<h4 align="center"></h4><p>【节】3388．“因为她甚是好看”表它因被称为神性而有可能很容易被接受。  这从“好看”的含义清楚可知，“好看”是指某种因其形式而令人愉悦并因此很容易被接受的事物。此处论述的主题是那些拥有信之教义，但没有通过良善拥有对真理的直觉之人，他们只有对真理的良善，这良知仅仅由父母和老师的教导构成。这些人被称为“这地方（即基拉耳）的人”（<a href="3385.htm">3385</a>，<a href="3387.htm">3387</a>节）。对这些人来说，确认真理的第一个阶段已经达到，即它被称为神性，因为他们现在立刻对神圣之物有一个概念，这有助于全面确认告知他们的每一件事，即使他们不理解。尽管如此，告知他们的事必须在他们的理解范围内。因为知道某种事物存在对人来说来不够，他还想了解它，知道它的性质，以便对它的确认能抵达其心智的理解力部分，并从那里回来。如果没有这种愿望存在，那么诚然，一件事能被引入记忆中，但它在那里就像某种死物，或毫无意义的声音；除非有某种确认之物，无论来自哪个源头，将它固定在记忆中，否则，它会像某种纯声音之物的记忆那样溜走。</p>

Because she was good to look upon. That this signifies that it might be easily received from its being called Divine, is evident from the signification of "good to look upon," as being that which pleases 
by its form, thus what is easily received. Those are here treated of who are in the doctrinal things of faith, and have no perception of truth from good, but only a conscience of truth from having 
been so taught by parents and masters. These are they who are called the "men of the place," or of Gerar (n. 3385, 3387). With such persons the first of confirmation of truth is that it is called Divine, 
for then they at once have an idea of what is holy, which gives a universal confirmation to everything that is stated, even if they do not comprehend it. But still what is stated must be adapted 
to their apprehension; for it is not sufficient for a man to know that a thing is; he also desires to know what it is, and what is its nature, in order that he may therein find some confirmation for 
his intellectual part, and from this again in turn. If this be not the case, a thing may indeed be induced on the memory; but it does not remain there otherwise than as a dead thing, or as a mere sound; 
and unless confirmatory things from some source or other have fixed it in the memory, it is dissipated like the remembrance of some mere thing of sound. </p>

'For she was good-looking' means that it could be received without difficulty because of its being called Divine. This is clear from the meaning of 'good-looking' as something which because of its form 
is pleasing and so is received without difficulty. The subject is those who possess matters of doctrine concerning faith but who do not have from good any perception of truth, only a conscience regarding 
what is true which consists simply of what their parents and teachers have told them. These are they who are called 'the men of the place (which is Gerar)', <a href="3385.htm">3385</a>, <a href="3387.htm">3387</a>. With these people the first 
stage in the confirmation of such truth is reached, in that it is called Divine, for now they immediately have a concept of that which is holy, and this contributes an overall confirmation to every 
single thing they are told even though they do not grasp it. Nevertheless what they are told must come within their ability to grasp those things. It is not enough for a person to know that something 
exists; he also wishes to know something about it, and the nature of it if any confirmation of it is to reach the understanding part of his mind, and come back from there. If that wish is not present 
something may indeed be introduced into the memory, but it remains there as no more than something dead, like a meaningless sound, and unless some confirmatory evidence from whatever source drives it 
home it slips away like the remembrance of something that merely made a sound. </p>

`Quia bona aspectu illa': quod significet quod facile recipi posset ex eo quod Divinum dicatur, constat ex significatione `boni aspectu' quod sit illud quod ea forma placet, ita quod facile recipitur. 
Agitur de illis qui in doctrinalibus fidei sunt, et nullam perceptionem veri ea bono habent, sed modo conscientiam veri ex eo quod ita illis a parentibus et magistris dictum, qui sunt qui vocat `viri 
loci' seu Geraris, n. 3385, 3387; illis primum confirmationis ver est quod Divinum dicatur, {1}statim enim tunc illis est idea sancti quae dat {2}universalem confirmationem omnibus et singulis quae 
dicuntur, et hoc tametsi id non capiunt; at usque quae dicuntur, erunt adaequata captui illorum; non enim satis est ut homo sciat quod sit, sed etiam scire vult quid sit, et quale sit, ut inde aliqua 
confirmatio accedat parti ejus intellectuali, et vicissim ab ea; si non hoc, quidem induci potest memoriae, sed ibi non manet aliter quam res mortua sicut res soni, et nisi confirmantia aliqua illud 
infixerint, undecumque illa sint, dissipatur sicut reminiscentia cujusdam rei modo sonantis. @1 illico$  @2 primum$  </p>
