<h3 align="center" class="ired">属天的奥秘 第1542节</h3>
<h4 align="center"></h4><p>1542．就内义而言，这些细节，以及本章接下来的细节均代表主；它们继续论述主孩童时的生命。这从前一章，以及下文的论述和说明清楚可知，尤其从以下事实可知：这是主的圣言，圣言经由天堂来自主，因此所写的一点一划无不包含天堂的奥秘。出自这样的源头之物不可能具有其它性质。前面说过，就内义而言，所论述的主题是主孩童时所接受的教导。有两种事物会阻碍人变得属天，一种是属于其理解力之物，另一种是属于其意愿之物：属于其理解力的，是人在童年和青春期所学到的无用的记忆知识；属于意愿的，则是由他倾向的恶欲所产生的乐趣。前者和后者都会阻碍他获得属天之物。这些事物必须首先被驱散；当它们被驱散后，他首次能被引入属天之物所折射的光中，最终进入属天之光本身。<br />由于主和其他人一样出生并接受教导，所以祂有必要学习记忆知识，这就是亚伯兰寄居在埃及所代表和表示的；空洞的记忆知识最终离开了祂，这一点由“法老吩咐人将亚伯兰和他妻子、以及他一切所有的都送走了”（12:20）来代表。属于意愿之物并构成感官人，或最外在之人的乐趣也离开了祂，这一点在本章由罗得来代表，因为他与亚伯兰分离，罗得就代表这样的人。</p><br />

<p><strong>[NCE]1542.</strong> In their inner sense these words and the following verses of the current chapter also represent the Lord; they continue to treat of his life from the time when he was a boy. This can be seen from remarks and illustrations in the previous chapter and from what follows [搂搂<a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_1542/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_1544" target=_top>1544</a>, <a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_1542/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_1548" target=_top>1548</a>, <a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_1542/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_1556" target=_top>1556</a>, <a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_1542/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_1557" target=_top>1557</a>, <a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_1542/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_1560" target=_top>1560</a>]. Above all, it can be seen from the fact that this is the Lord's Word, that it has come down from him through heaven, and that as a result not the smallest part of a word has been written in it that does not involve secrets of heaven. Nothing derived from such a source could ever be otherwise.<br />It has already been shown that the inner meaning has to do with the Lord's education when he was young [搂搂<a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_1542/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_1402" target=_top>1402</a>, <a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_1542/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_1459" target=_top>1459-1502</a>].<br />There are two things in us that prevent us from becoming heavenly. One belongs to our intellectual side; the other, to our volitional side. The intellectual one is the useless facts that we soak up in youth and early adulthood. The volitional one is the gratification of our most cherished cravings. Both block us from attaining heavenly goals. They need to be shaken off first, and when they have been, then we can enter first into the light reflected by heavenly things and finally into heavenly light itself.<br />[2] Since the Lord was born like any other person, and needed to be taught like any other person, he too had to learn facts, a situation that was represented and symbolized by Abram's stay in Egypt. Superfluous knowledge eventually parted from him, and this was represented by verse <a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_1542/bible_king-james-version_genesis_12_20" target=_top>20</a> of the last chapter: "Pharaoh gave orders concerning Abram to his men, and they sent him away, and his wife, and all that he had." Sensual gratification 钬?which the urges of our will lead us into, and which compose our sense-oriented (or most superficial){*1} self 钬?also disappeared from him. This is represented in the current chapter by Lot's separation from Abram, since Lot represents our sense-oriented side.<br /><br /><strong>Footnotes:</strong><br />{*1} The translation here assumes the reading seu extimum ("or most superficial") for the first edition's sed extimum ("but most superficial"). Elliott adopts a similar reading in his translation (Swedenborg [1749-1756] 1983-1999). [LHC] </p>

That in the internal sense these things, and those that follow in this chapter, also represent the Lord, and that it is a continuation of His life from childhood, may be seen from what was said and shown 
in the preceding chapter, and also from what follows, but especially from the consideration that this is the Word of the Lord, and that it has come down from Him through heaven, and therefore that 
not even the least bit of a word has been written that does not involve heavenly arcana. That which comes from such an origin cannot possibly be of any other nature. It has been shown already that in 
the internal sense the Lord's instruction when a child is treated of. There are two things with man which prevent his becoming celestial, one of which belongs to his intellectual, and the other to his 
will part: that which belongs to the intellectual part consists of the empty memory-knowledges he learns in childhood and youth; and that which belongs to the will part consists of pleasures from the 
cupidities which he favors. These are the hindrances that prevent his being able to attain to celestial things. These are first to be dispersed; and when they have been dispersed, he can then for the 
first time be admitted into the light of celestial things, and at last into celestial light.  [2] As the Lord was born as are other men, and was to be informed as others are, it was necessary for 
Him to learn memory-knowledges, which was represented and signified by Abram's sojourn in Egypt; and that the empty memory-knowledges at last left Him, was represented by Pharaoh's commanding his men 
respecting him, and by their sending him away, and his wife, and all that he had. (See the foregoing chapter, verse 20.) But that the pleasures which pertain to the things of the will, and which constitute 
the sensuous man, but the outermost of it, also left Him, is represented in this chapter by Lot, in that he separated himself from Abram; for Lot represents such a man. </p>

That these details and those that follow in this chapter also in the internal sense represent the Lord, and that they continue the subject of His life from childhood, becomes clear from the things which 
have been stated and shown in the previous chapter and also from those which follow. Above all it becomes clear from the fact that this is the Word of the Lord and has come down from Him by way of 
heaven, and thus that not one single part of any expression has been written down in it that does not embody heavenly arcana. With an origin such as this how can it ever be anything different? That the 
subject in the internal sense is the instruction received by the Lord when a boy has been shown already. There are with man two things which prevent his becoming celestial; one belongs to the understanding 
part of his mind, the other to the will part. Belonging to the understanding part are the useless facts which he absorbs in childhood and adolescence; belonging to the will part are the pleasures 
arising out of the evil desires which he inclines to. Both the former and the latter are what stand in the way of him possibly attaining to celestial things. These must first be dispersed, and when 
they have been dispersed he is able for the first time to be introduced into the light reflected by celestial things, and finally into celestial light itself. </p>

 Because the Lord was born as any 
other is born and needed to be taught as any other has to be, He had also to learn facts; this was represented and meant by Abram's sojourning in Egypt. And the consideration that empty facts ultimately 
went away from Him was also represented by Pharaoh's giving his men orders to send him away, and his wife, and everything he had - verse 20 of the previous chapter. The fact that the pleasures which 
belong to the will parts of the mind and which constitute the sensory or most external man also went away from Him is represented in this chapter by Lot separating himself from Abram, for Lot represents 
the sensory man. </p>

Quod haec et sequentia hujus capitis in sensu interno etiam repraesentent Dominum et quod sit continuatio Ipsius vitae a pueritia, constare potest ex illis quae in capite praecedente dicta et ostensa 
sunt, tam ex illis quae sequuntur, cumprimis ex eo quod Verbum Domini sit, et ab Ipso per caelum descenderit, et sic quod ne quidem minimum vocis scriptum sit quod non arcana caelestia involvat: quod 
a tali origine, nequaquam potest aliter esse: quod in sensu interno actum sit de Domini instructione dum puer, ostensum est. Sunt bina apud hominem quae faciunt ut caelestis nequeat fieri; unum ad intellectualem 
ejus partem, alter ad voluntariam, pertinet; quod ad intellectualem, sunt scientifica inania quae in pueritia et adolescentia haurit; quod ad voluntarium sunt voluptates e cupiditatibus 
quibus favet; illa et haec sunt quae impediunt quia possit ad caelestia pervenire; haec primum discutienda sunt, et cum discussa sunt, tunc primum intromitti potest in lucem caelestium, et tandem in lucem 
caelestem.  [2] Quia Dominus natus fuit sicut alius homo, et informandus sicut alius, scientifica addiscere quoque debuit, quod repraesentatum et significatum est per 'Abrami peregrinationem in Aegypto'; 
et quod scientifica inania tandem Ipsum reliquerint, etiam repraesentatum est per quod 'Pharao praeceperit super illo viris, et dimiserunt illum, et uxorem illius, et omnia quae illi,' cap. praec. 
vers. 20: quod autem voluptates, quae sunt voluntariorum, et constituunt sensualem hominem sed extimum, etiam Ipsum reliquerint, in hoc capite repraesentatur per 'Lotum, quod separaverit se ab Abramo'; 
'Lotus' enim repraesentat hominem talem. </p>
