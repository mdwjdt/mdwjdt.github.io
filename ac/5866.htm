A continuation about the angels and spirits with man will be found at the end of the following chapter.       </p>
<p>     Genesis 45 </p>
<p>     1. And Joseph could not restrain himself before all that were 
standing by him; and he cried, Cause every man to go out from with me. And there stood not anyone with him while Joseph made himself known unto his brethren.      2. And he gave forth his voice in weeping; 
and the Egyptians heard, and the house of Pharaoh heard.      3. And Joseph said unto his brethren, I am Joseph; doth my father yet live? And his brethren could not answer him; for they were 
in consternation before him.      4. And Joseph said unto his brethren, Come ye near to me I pray. And they came near. And he said, I am Joseph your brother, whom ye sold into Egypt.      5. And now 
be not grieved, neither let there be anger in your eyes, that ye sold me hither; for God did send me before you to make to live.      6. For this two years the famine is in the midst of the land; and 
there are yet five years wherein is no plowing and harvest.      7. And God sent me before you to put for you remains in the land, and to make you live for a great escape.      8. And now not you 
have sent me hither, but God; and He set me for a father to Pharaoh, and for lord to all his house, and I rule in all the land of Egypt.      9. Haste ye and go up to my father, and say unto him, Thus 
hath said thy son Joseph, God hath set me for lord to all Egypt; come down unto me, tarry not: </p>
<p>     10. And thou shalt dwell in the land of Goshen, and thou shalt be near unto me, thou, and thy sons, 
and thy sons' sons, and thy flocks, and thy herds, and all that thou hast: </p>
<p>     11. And I will sustain thee there; for there are yet five years of famine; lest thou be rooted out, thou, and thy household, 
and all that thou hast.      12. And behold your eyes see, and the eyes of my brother Benjamin, that with my mouth I am speaking unto you.      13. And ye shall tell my father all my glory 
in Egypt, and all that ye have seen; and haste ye and bring down my father hither.      14. And he fell upon his brother Benjamin's necks and wept; and Benjamin wept upon his necks.      15. And he 
kissed all his brethren, and wept upon them; and afterward his brethren talked with him.      16. And the voice was heard in Pharaoh's house, saying, Joseph's brethren have come; and it was good in the 
eyes of Pharaoh, and in the eyes of his servants.      17. And Pharaoh said unto Joseph, Say unto thy brethren, This do ye; lade your beasts, and go, come ye into the land of Canaan; </p>
<p>     18. And 
take your father, and your households, and come unto me; and I will give you the good of the land of Egypt, and ye shall eat the fat of the land.      19. And now commanded, this do ye: take you out 
of the land of Egypt carts for your babes, and for your women, and bring your father, and come.      20. And let not your eye be sparing upon your stuff; because the good of the whole land of Egypt, 
this is for you.      21. And the sons of Israel did so: and Joseph gave them carts, according to the mouth of Pharaoh, and gave them provision for the way.      22. And to all of them he gave to each 
changes of garments; and to Benjamin he gave three hundred pieces of silver, and five changes of garments.      23. And to his father he sent after this manner: ten asses carrying of the good of 
Egypt, and ten she-asses carrying grain and bread and nourishment for his father for the way.      24. And he sent his brethren away, and they departed; and he said unto them, Contend not in the way.  
    25. And they went up out of Egypt, and came into the land of Canaan unto Jacob their father.      26. And they told him, saying, Joseph is yet alive, and he is ruler in all the land of Egypt. 
And his heart failed, because he believed them not.      27. And they spake unto him all the words of Joseph, which he spake unto them; and he saw the carts which Joseph had sent to carry him, and the 
spirit of Jacob their father revived: </p>
<p>     28. And Israel said, It is much; Joseph my son is yet alive; I will go and see him before I die. </p>

<p>GENESEOS CAPUT QUADRAGESIMUM QUINTUM </p>
<p>1.  Et non potuit Joseph continere se ad omnes stantes apud illum, et clamavit, 
Exire facite omnem virum ab apud me; et non stetit quisquam cum illo in notum faciendo se Joseph ad fratres suos. 2.  Et edidit vocem suam in fletu, et audiverunt Aegyptii, et audivit domus Pharaonis. 3. 
 Et dixit Joseph ad fratres suos, Ego Joseph, an adhuc pater meus vivit? et non potuerunt fratres ejus respondere illi, quia consternati a coram illo. 4.  Et dixit Joseph ad fratres suos, 
Accedite quaeso ad me, et accesserunt, et dixit, Ego Joseph frater vester, quem vendidistis me Aegyptum. 5.  Et nunc, ne dolori vobis sit, et ne irae sit in oculis vestris, quod vendideritis me huc, 
quia ad vivificationem misit me DEUS ante vos. 6.  Quia hoc, anni duo famis in medio terrae, et adhuc quinque anni, quibus nulla aratio et messis. 7.  Et misit me DEUS ante vos ad ponendum vobis reliquias 
in terra, et ad vivificandum vos ad evasionem magnam. 8.  Et nunc non vos misistis me huc, sed DEUS, et posuit me ad patrem Pharaoni, et ad dominum omni domui suae, et dominor in omni terra Aegypti. 9. 
 Festinate et ascendite ad patrem meum, et dicatis ad illum, Ita dixit filius tuus Joseph, Posuit me DEUS ad dominum omni Aegypto, descende ad me, ne subsistas. 10.  Et habitabis in terra 
 Goshen,  et eris  propinquus  ad me, tu et filii tui et filii filiorum tuorum, et greges tui, et armenta tua, et omne quod tibi. 11.  Et sustentabo te ibi, quia adhuc quinque anni famis, ne forte exstirperis 
tu et domus tua, et omne quod tibi. 12.  Et ecce oculi vestri vident, et oculi fratris mei Benjamin, quod ore loquens ad vos. 13.  Et indicetis patri meo omnem gloriam meam in Aegypto, et 
omne quod videtis, et festinetis, et descendere faciatis patrem meum huc. 14.  Et cecidit super colla Benjaminis fratris sui, et flevit, et Benjamin flevit super collis illius. 15.  Et osculatus omnes 
fratres suos, et flevit super illis; et postea locuti sunt fratres illius cum illo. 16.  Et vox audita domo Pharaonis, dicendo, Venerunt fratres Josephi; et bonum fuit in oculis Pharaonis, et in oculis 
servorum illius. 17.  Et dixit Pharaoh ad Josephum, Dic ad fratres tuos, Hoc facite, onerate jumenta vestra, et ite, venite terram Canaan. 18.  Et accipite patrem vestrum, et domos vestras, et 
venite ad me, et dabo vobis bonum terrae Aegypti, et comedetis pingue terrae. 19.  Et nunc mandatum hoc facite; accipite vobis e terra Aegypti vehicula infantibus vestris et mulieribus vestris, et feratis 
patrem vestrum, et veniatis. 20.  Et oculus vester ne parcat super supellectilibus vestris, quia bonum totius terrae Aegypti vobis hoc. 21.  Et fecerunt ita filii Israelis, et dedit illis Joseph 
vehicula juxta os Pharaonis; et dedit illis viaticum ad viam. 22.  Et omnibus illis dedit cuique mutatorias vestes; et Benjamini dedit trecentos argenti, et quinque mutatorias vestes. 23.  Et patri 
suo misit ut hoc, decem asinos portantes e bono Aegypti, et decem asinas portantes frumentum et panem, et alimentum patri suo ad viam. 24.  Et dimisit fratres suos, et iverunt; et dixit ad illos, 
Ne contendatis in via. 25.  Et ascenderunt ex Aegypto, et venerunt terram Canaan ad Jacobum patrem eorum. 26.  Et indicaverunt illi, dicendo, Adhuc Joseph vivit, et quod ille dominans in omni terra 
Aegypti; et defecit cor ejus, quia non credidit illis. 27.  Et locuti sunt ad illum omnia verba Josephi quae locutus ad illos; et vidit vehicula quae misit Joseph ad ferendum illum; et revixit spiritus 
Jacobi patris illorum. 28.  Et dixit Israel, Multum, adhuc Joseph filius meus vivit, ibo et videbo illum antequam morior. </p>
