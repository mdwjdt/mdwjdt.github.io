<h3 align="center" class="ired">属天的奥秘 第668节</h3>
<h4 align="center"></h4><p><strong>668.</strong>“儿子”表真理，“妻子”表良善。这一点在创世记5:4早已说明，此处用了“众子与众女”一词。然而，这里用的是“儿子”和“妻子”，因为“妻子”是与真理相联结的良善。若非有真理所源自的良善或快乐存在，就不可能产生真理。生命在良善与快乐中，而非在真理中，除非在真理所源自的良善和快乐中。真理通过这二者被形成和产生，同样，关乎真理的信被关乎良善的爱形成和产生。真理就象光一样：若没有太阳或火焰的放射之物，就没有光。正是由于这放射之物，光才得以形成。真理只是良善所取的形式，信只是爱所取的形式。真理照着良善的品质通过良善得以形成，信照着爱或仁的品质通过爱得以形成。这就为何会提到“妻子”和“妻子们”的原因，她们表示与真理结合的良善。因此，下一节经文说到一切成双成对的活物进入方舟，一公一母，因为若不将良善与真理结合起来，就不会有重生。</p>

<p><strong>[NCE]668.</strong> The fact that the sons are truth and the wives goodness was also shown earlier, at <a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_668/bible_king-james-version_genesis_5_4" target=_top>Genesis 5:4</a> [<a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_668/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_489" target=_top>489-491</a>]. That verse spoke of sons and daughters but this one speaks of sons and their wives, because wives are the good connected with truth.<br />No truth would ever come into being if something good or pleasurable did not exist for it to grow out of. Goodness and pleasure have life in them, but truth does not have any life besides that which it gains from goodness and pleasure. It is from these that truth forms and sprouts. The same applies to faith (a matter of truth), which comes from love (a matter of goodness). Truth is like light. No light exists that does not come from the sun, that is, flame; this is the source from which light develops.<br />Truth is simply the form of goodness, and faith is simply the form of love. Truth develops out of goodness according to the quality of the goodness, and faith develops according to the quality of love or charity.<br />This, then, is the reason for the mention of a wife and wives, symbolizing the good connected with truth. For the same reason, the next verse says that two of each, a male and a female, were to enter the ark. Unless good is attached, no regeneration occurs. </p>
<p align="center"><b>Potts(1905-1910) 668</b></p><p><b>668.</b>
That "sons" signify truths, and "daughters" goods, has also been shown before-at chapter 5, verse 4-where "sons" and "daughters" were spoken of. But here it is "sons" and "wives" because "wives" are 
the goods that are adjoined to truths; for no truth can be produced unless there is a good or delight from which it is. In good and in delight there is life; but not in truth, except that which it has 
from good and delight. From this, truth is formed and begotten, and so is faith, which is of truth, formed and begotten by love, which is of good. It is with truth exactly as it is with light: except 
from the sun or a flame there is no light; it is from this that light is formed. Truth is only the form of good; and faith is only the form of love. Truth is formed from good according to the quality 
of the good, and faith is formed from love according to the quality of the love or charity. This then is the reason why a "wife" and "wives" are mentioned, which signify goods adjoined to truths. And 
hence it is said in the following verse that pairs of all were to enter into the ark, a male and a female; for without goods adjoined to truths there is no regeneration. </p>

<p align="center"><b>Elliott(1983-1999) 668</b></p><p><b>668.</b>
'Sons' means truths and 'wives' goods. This also has been shown already at Chapter 5:4 where the phrase 'sons and daughters' is used. Here however it is 'sons and wives', for 'wives' are goods which 
have been joined to truths. Indeed no truth can ever be brought forth unless some good or delight exists for it to spring from. Within good and delight there is life, but not within truth apart from that 
which it derives from good and delight. It is from these that truth is given form and develops, even as faith, which is connected with truth, is given form by and develops out of love, which is connected 
with good. Truth is like light; there is no light apart from that which flows from the sun or flame. It is from these that light is given form. Truth is merely the form which good takes, and faith 
merely the form which love takes. The form that truth takes depends therefore on the character of its good, as does that of faith on that of its love or charity. This is the reason why 'wife' and 
'wives who mean goods that have been joined to truths are meant at this point. This also is why in the next verse reference is made to pairs of all, male and female, entering the ark, for without goods 
joined to truths regeneration does not take place. </p>

<p align="center"><b>Latin(1748-1756) 668</b>
</p><b>668.</b>
Quod 'filii' sint vera, et 'uxores' sint bona, etiam prius ostensum est ad cap. v. 4, ubi 'filii et filiae,' hic autem 'filii et uxores,' quia 'uxores' sunt illa bona quae adjuncta sunt veris: nusquam 
enim aliquid verum produci potest nisi sit bonum seu jucundum ex quo; in bono et jucundo est vita, non autem in vero nisi quam habet a bono et jucundo; verum inde formatur et germinatur; similiter 
fides quae est veri, ab amore qui est boni; habet se verum sicut lux; nisi ex sole seu flamma, nulla lux; est lux inde formata.  Verum est modo forma boni, et fides est modo forma amoris; verum inde formatur 
secundum qualitatem boni, et fides secundum qualitatem amoris seu charitatis: haec nunc causa est quod 'uxor et uxores' nominentur, quae significant bona adjuncta veris; inde in sequente versu, 
quod 'bina ab omnibus intrarent in arcam, masculus et femina'; nam absque bonis adjunctis nulla regeneratio. </p>
