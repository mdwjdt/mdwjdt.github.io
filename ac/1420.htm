<h3 align="center" class="ired">属天的奥秘 第1420节</h3>
<h4 align="center"></h4><p><strong>1420.</strong>“你也要成为一个福源”表万有皆来自主，无论总体还是细节。这从“福源”的含义清楚可知。“福源”涉及一切良善，外在意义涉及肉体、世俗和属世的良善，内在意义上则涉及属灵和属天的良善。“成为一个福源”就是成为一切良善的源头和给予者。这决不可能是说亚伯兰，由此清楚可知，“亚伯兰”代表主，唯独主是一个福源。后面同样论及亚伯拉罕说：<br />亚伯拉罕必要大而又兴盛的民族，地上所有的民族都必因他得福。（创世记<a href="http://39-27.cn/创18.18.htm">18:18</a>）<br />关于以撒：<br />地上所有的民族必因你的种得福。（创世记<a href="http://39-27.cn/创26.4.htm">26:4</a>）<br />关于雅各：<br />地上所有的宗族必因你和你的种得福。（创世记<a href="http://39-27.cn/创28.14.htm">28:14</a>）<br />谁都能清楚看出，民族不可能、也没有因亚伯拉罕、以撒、雅各，以及他们的种而得福，而是因主而得福。这在诗篇中说得更明白：<br />祂的名要存到永远，祂儿子的名要留传如日之久。万族要称祂有福。（诗篇<a href="http://39-27.cn/诗72.17.htm">72:17</a>）<br />这论及主。<br />你使他有洪福，直到永远。（诗篇<a href="http://39-27.cn/诗21.6.htm">21:6</a>）<br />这也论及主。耶利米书：<br />列族必因耶和华蒙福，也必因他夸耀。（耶利米书<a href="http://39-27.cn/耶4.2.htm">4:2</a>）<br />由上述经文明显可知，“一个福源”表主，当主被称作“一个福源”时，就表示一切属天和属灵之物皆来自祂，这些事物唯独是良善；因为唯独是良善，故它们唯独是真理。属世、世俗和肉体的良善成为良善，并被祝福的程度，要视它们里面所含的属天和属灵之善的多少而定。</p><br />

<p><strong>[NCE]1420.</strong> The fact that and you will be a blessing means that absolutely everything is from the Lord can be seen from the symbolism of a blessing. The word blessing is used for all kinds of benefits 钬?personal, worldly, and earthly benefits in the superficial sense, and spiritual and heavenly benefits in a deeper sense. To be a blessing is to be one from whom everything good comes, one who gives us all those benefits, which could never be said of Abram. This too provides evidence that Abram represents the Lord, since the Lord alone is a blessing. The case is the same with later statements regarding Abraham, such as:<br />Abraham shall unquestionably become a great and populous nation, and all the nations of the earth will be blessed in him. (<a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_1420/bible_king-james-version_genesis_18_18" target=_top>Genesis 18:18</a>)<br />Regarding Isaac:<br />All the nations of the earth will be blessed in your seed. (<a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_1420/bible_king-james-version_genesis_26_4" target=_top>Genesis 26:4</a>)<br />Regarding Jacob:<br />All the clans of the earth will be blessed in you and in your seed. (<a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_1420/bible_king-james-version_genesis_28_14" target=_top>Genesis 28:14</a>)<br />Anyone can see that nations cannot be 钬?and have not been 钬?blessed in Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob or in their seed but in the Lord. David says so openly:<br />His name will exist forever; before the face of the sun, the name of [a monarch's] son will be his, and all nations will be blessed in him. (<a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_1420/bible_king-james-version_psalms_72_17" target=_top>Psalms 72:17</a>)<br />This is about the Lord. In the same author:<br />You will appoint him to be eternal blessings. (<a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_1420/bible_king-james-version_psalms_21_6" target=_top>Psalms 21:6</a>)<br />This too is about the Lord. In Jeremiah:<br />The nations will be blessed in him, and of him they will boast. (<a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_1420/bible_king-james-version_jeremiah_4_2" target=_top>Jeremiah 4:2</a>)<br />All this now indicates that a blessing symbolizes the Lord. It also shows that when he is called a blessing, the meaning is that from him come all heavenly and spiritual qualities, which are the only good things there are; and since they are the only good things, they are the only true things. As a consequence, to the extent that earthly, worldly, and personal benefits contain heavenly and spiritual benefits, they actually are beneficial, and actually are blessings. </p>
<p align="center"><b>Potts(1905-1910) 1420</b></p><p><b>1420.</b>
And thou shalt be a blessing. That this signifies that all things both in general and in particular are from the Lord, is evident from the signification of "a blessing." A "blessing" is predicated of 
all goods; in the external sense, of corporeal, worldly, and natural goods; in the internal sense, of spiritual and celestial goods. "To be a blessing," is to be the source of all goods, and the giver 
of all goods. This can by no means be said of Abram, and hence it is evident that by Abram is represented the Lord, who alone is "a blessing." In like manner in regard to what is said of Abraham hereafter: </p>
<p> 
    Abraham shall surely become a great and numerous nation, and in him shall all the nations of the earth be blessed (Gen. 18:18); </p>
<p>of Isaac: </p>
<p>     In thy seed shall all the nations of the 
earth be blessed (Gen. 26:4), and of Jacob: </p>
<p>     In thee and in thy seed shall all the families of the earth be blessed (Gen. 28:14). That nations cannot be blessed, and are not blessed, in Abraham, 
Isaac, and Jacob, and in their seed, but in the Lord, may be seen by everyone. This is clearly said in David: </p>
<p>     His name shall endure forever; before the sun shall the name of his son endure; and 
all nations shall be blessed in him (Ps. 72:17); </p>
<p>where the Lord is treated of. Again: </p>
<p>     Thou shalt set him for blessings forever (Ps. 21:6); </p>
<p>where also the Lord is treated of. In Jeremiah: </p>
<p>  
   The nations shall be blessed in Him, and in Him shall they glory (Jer. 4:2). From these passages it is now evident that "a blessing" signifies the Lord, and that when He is called "a blessing," it 
signifies that from Him are all celestial and spiritual things, which alone are goods; and because they alone are goods, they alone are truths; and therefore in proportion as there are celestial and 
spiritual goods in natural, worldly, and corporeal ones, in the same proportion these are goods, and are "blessed." </p>

<p align="center"><b>Elliott(1983-1999) 1420</b></p><p><b>1420.</b>
'You will be a blessing' means that every single thing comes from the Lord. This becomes clear from the meaning of 'a blessing'. Blessing has reference to every form of good - in the external sense to 
bodily, worldly, and natural forms, in the internal sense to spiritual and celestial forms. 'Being a blessing' means the Source of every form of good and the Giver of this, an attribution that cannot 
possibly be made to Abram. From this it is also clear that 'Abram' represents the Lord, who alone is a Blessing. So also with the attributions made to Abraham further on, such as, </p>
<blockquote>
Abraham will surely 
become a great and numerous nation, and in him all the nations of the earth will be blessed. <a href="http://bible.gospelcom.net/cgi-bin/bible?passage=Gen%2018:18&amp;version=ESV&amp;interface=print&amp;showfn=yes&amp;showxref">Gen 18:18</a>. 
</blockquote>
<p>Concerning Isaac, </p>
<blockquote>
In your seed will all the nations of the earth be blessed. <a href="http://bible.gospelcom.net/cgi-bin/bible?passage=Gen%2026:4&amp;version=ESV&amp;interface=print&amp;showfn=yes&amp;showxref">Gen 26:4</a>. 
</blockquote>
<p>And 
concerning Jacob,  </p>
<blockquote>
In you all the families of the earth will be blessed, and in your seed. <a href="http://bible.gospelcom.net/cgi-bin/bible?passage=Gen%2028:14&amp;version=ESV&amp;interface=print&amp;showfn=yes&amp;showxref">Gen 28:14</a>. 
</blockquote>
<p>That nations are not able to be blessed, nor were they blessed, in Abraham, Isaac, 
and Jacob, and in their seed, but that they were blessed in the Lord, may become clear to anyone. This is clearly stated in David, </p>
<blockquote>
His name will be for ever, before the sun His son's name; and all 
nations will be blessed in Him <a href="http://bible.gospelcom.net/cgi-bin/bible?passage=Ps%2072:17&amp;version=ESV&amp;interface=print&amp;showfn=yes&amp;showxref">Ps 72:17</a>. 
</blockquote>
<p>This refers to the Lord. In the same author, </p>
<blockquote>
You set Him to be blessings for ever. <a href="http://bible.gospelcom.net/cgi-bin/bible?passage=Ps%2021:6&amp;version=ESV&amp;interface=print&amp;showfn=yes&amp;showxref">Ps 21:6</a>. 
</blockquote>
<p>This also refers to the Lord. In Jeremiah, </p>
<blockquote>
In Him the 
nations will be blessed, and in Him will they glory. <a href="http://bible.gospelcom.net/cgi-bin/bible?passage=Jer%204:2&amp;version=ESV&amp;interface=print&amp;showfn=yes&amp;showxref">Jer 4:2</a>. 
</blockquote>
<p>From these places it is now clear that 'a blessing' means the Lord, and when He is called a Blessing that it means that from Him come 
all celestial and spiritual things which alone are goods. And because they alone are goods they alone are truths as well. To the extent therefore that celestial and spiritual forms of good are present 
in natural, worldly, and bodily forms, the latter are good and are blessed. </p>

<p align="center"><b>Latin(1748-1756) 1420</b>
</p><b>1420.</b>
'Et eris benedictio': quod significet quod omnia et singula a Domino, constare potest a significatione 'benedictionis'; benedictio praedicatur de omnibus bonis, in sensu externo de bonis corporeis, mundanis 
et naturalibus; in sensu interno de bonis spiritualibus et caelestibus; 'esse benedictio' est a Quo omnia bona et Qui omnia illa bona dat, quod nusquam praedicari potest de Abramo; inde quoque 
constat quod per 'Abramum' repraesentetur Dominus, Qui solus est Benedictio; similiter quod in sequentibus praedicatur de Abrahamo, ut Abrahamus omnino erit in gentem magnam et numerosam, et benedicentur 
in illo omnes gentes terrae, Gen. xviii 18; </p>
<p>de Isaco, Benedicentur in semine tuo omnes gentes terrae, Gen. xxvi 4; </p>
<p>de Jacobo, Benedicentur in te omnes familiae terrae, et in semine tuo, Gen. 
xxviii 14; </p>
<p>quod gentes non benedici queant, nec benedictae sint, in Abrahamo, Isaco et Jacobo, inque eorum semine, sed quod in Domino, cuivis constare potest:  quod clare apud Davidem dicitur, Erit 
nomen Ipsius in aeternum, {1}ante solem filii nomen Ipsius, et benedicentur in Ipso omnes gentes, Ps. 1xxii 17; </p>
<p>ubi de Domino:  apud eundem, Pones Ipsum benedictiones in aeternum, Ps. xxi 7 [A.V. 6]; </p>
<p>ubi 
etiam de Domino:  apud Jeremiam, Benedicentur in Ipso gentes, et in Ipso gloriabuntur, iv 2. Ex his nunc constat quod 'benedictio' significet Dominum, et cum appellatur Benedictio, quod significet 
quod ab Ipso omnia caelestia et spiritualia quae unice sunt bona, et quia unice sunt bona, etiam unice sunt vera; quare quantum ex caelestibus et spiritualibus bonis inest in naturalibus, mundanis 
et corporeis, tantum haec sunt bona et tantum sunt benedicta. @1 In A.E. 401 S. has coram sole nomen Filii habebit.$ </p>
