<h3 align="center" class="ired">属天的奥秘 第1607节</h3>
<h4 align="center"></h4><p>1607．“凡你看见的所有地，我都要赐给你”表天国，它要成为主的。这从“地”，即在此背景下的“迦南地”（因为经上说“凡你看见的所有地”）含义清楚可知，“地”是指天国。事实上，迦南地既代表主在天上的国，也就是天堂，也代表主在地上的国，也就是教会。前面数次讨论过“地（或陆地）”的这一含义。天上和地上的国都被赋予主，这从圣言中的各处经文明显可知，如以赛亚书：<br />因有一婴孩为我们而生，有一子赐给我们，政权必担在祂的肩头上。祂名称为奇妙、策士、神、英雄、永存的父、和平的君王。（以赛亚书<a href="http://39-27.cn/赛9.6.htm">9:6</a>）<br />但以理书：<br />在夜间的异象中观看，见有一位像人子的，驾着天云而来，到万古常存者那里，被引领到他面前；得了权柄、荣耀、国度，使各民、各族国、各种方言的人都事奉他。祂的权柄是永远的，不能废去，祂的国必不灭亡。（但以理书<a href="http://39-27.cn/但7.13.htm">7:13</a>，<a href="http://39-27.cn/但7.14.htm">14</a>）<br />主自己也说了同样的话，马太福音：<br />一切所有的，都是我父交付我的。（马太福音<a href="http://39-27.cn/太11.27.htm">11:27</a>；路加福音<a href="http://39-27.cn/路10.22.htm">10:22</a>）<br /><br />天上地下所有的权柄都赐给我了。（马太福音<a href="http://39-27.cn/太28.18.htm">28:18</a>）<br />约翰福音：<br />正如你曾赐给子权柄，管理凡有血气的，是为叫祂将永生赐给一切你所赐给祂的人。（约翰福音<a href="http://39-27.cn/约17.2.htm">17:2</a>，<a href="http://39-27.cn/约17.3.htm">3</a>）<br />“坐在右手边”也有同样的含义，如路加福音：<br />从今以后，人子要坐在神权能的右手边。（路加福音<a href="http://39-27.cn/路22.69.htm">22:69</a>）<br />至于天上地下所有的权柄都赐给人子，当知道，主早在降世之前就已拥有管理天上地下所有的权柄，因为祂是永恒的神，祂是耶和华，如祂本人在约翰福音中所清楚声明的：<br />父啊，现在让我在你自己面前得着荣耀，就是未有世界以先，我同你所有的荣耀。（约翰福音<a href="http://39-27.cn/约17.5.htm">17:5</a>）<br />同一福音书：<br />我实实在在地告诉你们：还没有亚伯拉罕就有了我。（约翰福音<a href="http://39-27.cn/约8.58.htm">8:58</a>）<br />事实上，对存在于洪水前的上古教会来说，祂就是耶和华和神，他们曾见过祂。对存在于洪水后的古教会来说，祂也是耶和华和神；祂就是犹太教会的一切宗教仪式所代表的那一位，也是他们所敬拜的那一位。主之所以说天上地下所有的权柄都赐给了祂，好象这权柄原来不是祂的一样，是因为“人子”用来表示祂的人性本质，其人性本质与其神性本质融合后，也变成耶和华。权柄就在这时赐给了祂，在祂得荣耀，即祂的人性本质通过与神性本质融合而本身具有生命，同样变成神性和耶和华之前，这是不可能的事，如祂自己在约翰福音中所声称的：<br />因为父怎样在自己有生命，就赐给他儿子也照样在自己有生命。（约翰福音<a href="http://39-27.cn/约5.26.htm">5:26</a>）<br />从但以理书所引用经文中提到的“人子”和从以赛亚书所引用经文中提到的“一婴孩为我们而生，有一子赐给我们”，就是指祂的人性本质或外在人。天国要赐给祂，天上地下所有的权柄都被指示并应许给祂，这一事实就是“凡你看见的所有地，我都要赐给你和你的种，直到永远”所表示的。这一切发生在祂的人性本质与祂的神性本质融合之前；当祂战胜魔鬼和地狱，即凭祂自己的力量和大能逐出一切罪恶（因为唯独罪恶造成分离）时，融合就产生了。</p><br />

<p><strong>[NCE]1607.</strong> Because all the land that you see 钬?to you I will give it symbolizes the kingdom of heaven and the fact that it would be the Lord's. This can be seen from the symbolism of the land 钬?here the land of Canaan, since it says the land that you see 钬?as the kingdom of heaven. The land of Canaan represented the Lord's kingdom in the heavens (heaven) and his kingdom on earth (the church), a symbolism that has been discussed several times earlier [搂搂<a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_1607/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_1" target=_top>1</a>, <a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_1607/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_115" target=_top>115</a>, <a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_1607/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_620" target=_top>620</a>, <a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_1607/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_1025#subsection-2-4" target=_top>1025:4</a>, <a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_1607/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_1066" target=_top>1066</a>, <a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_1607/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_1413" target=_top>1413</a>, <a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_1607/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_1437" target=_top>1437</a>, <a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_1607/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_1585" target=_top>1585</a>].<br />Many places in the Word indicate that the Lord was given a kingdom in heaven and on earth. In Isaiah, for example:<br />A child has been born, a son has been given to us, and sovereignty will be on his shoulder; and his name will be called Miraculous, Counselor, God, Hero, Eternal Father, Prince of Peace. (<a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_1607/bible_king-james-version_isaiah_9_6" target=_top>Isaiah 9:6</a>)<br />In Daniel:<br />I was seeing in visions at night, and there! In the clouds of the heavens, it was as if the Son of Humankind was coming. And he came to the Ancient One,{*1} and they brought him before the [Ancient One]. And he was given power to rule, and glory, and kingship; and all peoples, nations, and tongues will serve him. His ruling power is eternal power that will not pass away, and his kingship one that will not perish. (<a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_1607/bible_king-james-version_daniel_7_13-14" target=_top>Daniel 7:13-14</a>)<br />The Lord himself also says this; in Matthew:<br />Everything has been turned over to me by my Father. (<a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_1607/bible_king-james-version_matthew_11_27" target=_top>Matthew 11:27</a>; and <a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_1607/bible_king-james-version_luke_10_22" target=_top>Luke 10:22</a>)<br />In another place in Matthew:<br />Authority in heaven and on earth has been given to me. (<a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_1607/bible_king-james-version_matthew_28_18" target=_top>Matthew 28:18</a>)<br />In John:<br />You have given your Son authority over all flesh, so that to all that you have given him he may give eternal life. (<a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_1607/bible_king-james-version_john_17_2-3" target=_top>John 17:2-3</a>)<br />The same thing is meant by sitting on his right side, as in Luke:<br />From this time now, the Son of Humankind will be sitting on the right side of God's strength. (<a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_1607/bible_king-james-version_luke_22_69" target=_top>Luke 22:69</a>)<br />[2] All authority in the heavens and on earth was given to the Son of Humankind, but it is important to realize that the Lord had authority over everything in the heavens and on earth before he came into the world. He was God from eternity, and Jehovah, as he himself clearly says in John:<br />Now make me glorious 钬?you, Father, in your own self 钬?with the glory that I had in you before the world existed. (<a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_1607/bible_king-james-version_john_17_5" target=_top>John 17:5</a>)<br />And in the same author:<br />Truly, truly, I say to you: before Abraham existed, I existed.{*2} (<a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_1607/bible_king-james-version_john_8_58" target=_top>John 8:58</a>)<br />After all, he was Jehovah and God to the people of the earliest church (the church before the Flood) and was visible to them. He was also Jehovah and God to the ancient church (the church after the Flood). And he was the one whom all the rituals of the Jewish religion represented and whom the Jews would worship. The reason he says that all authority in heaven and on earth was given to him, as if it was then happening for the first time, is that "Son of Humankind" means his human quality. Once this quality had become one with his divine quality, it too was Jehovah and at that same time possessed authority. This could never have happened before he had acquired his glory 钬?that is, before his human nature had also come to have life in itself, through union with his divine nature, and so had likewise become divine, had become Jehovah. He says so in John:<br />Just as the Father has life in himself, he has also granted the Son to have life in himself. (<a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_1607/bible_king-james-version_john_5_26" target=_top>John 5:26</a>)<br />[3] His human nature, or outer self, is also what Daniel calls Son of Humankind in the passage quoted above; and Isaiah in the passage quoted refers to it with the words "A child has been born and a son has been given to us."<br />He now saw and was promised that he would be given the kingdom of heaven and all power in the heavens and on earth, which is symbolized by the words "All the land that you see 钬?to you I will give it, and to your seed after you forever." This was before his human quality had become one with his divine quality, which happened when he completely overcame the Devil and hell. That is to say, it happened when he rid himself of all evil 钬?the only incompatible element 钬?by his own power and his own strength.<br /><br /><strong>Footnotes:</strong><br />{*1} The Latin phrase here translated "Ancient One" is antiquum dierum, "Ancient of Days." The Latin is a literal rendering of an Aramaic expression, 注址转旨执讬拽钬?钬欁曋棺炛醋欁?(钬榓tt卯q y么m卯n), understood to refer to God. It appears only in chapter <a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_1607/bible_king-james-version_daniel_7_1-28" target=_top>7</a> of Daniel: at verse <a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_1607/bible_king-james-version_daniel_7_13" target=_top>13</a>, as quoted here, and in verses <a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_1607/bible_king-james-version_daniel_7_9" target=_top>9</a>, <a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_1607/bible_king-james-version_daniel_7_22" target=_top>22</a>. [RS]<br />{*2} Previous English editions (Swedenborg [1749-1756] 1995-1998, Swedenborg [1749-1756] 1983-1999) have taken note of the fact that the verb of the original Greek in this verse is actually in the present tense ("I am"), not in the past tense ("I existed"). The deviation from the original is striking because it obscures the implicit connection between this verse and <a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_1607/bible_king-james-version_exodus_3_14" target=_top>Exodus 3:14</a>, in which Jehovah declares his identity by saying, in the present tense, "I am who I Am," and uses "I Am" as his name.

For all the land which thou seest, to thee will I give it. That this signifies the heavenly kingdom, that it should be the Lord's, is evident from the signification of "the land," and here of the land 
of Canaan-because it is said, "the land which thou seest"-as being the heavenly kingdom. For by the land of Canaan was represented the Lord's kingdom in the heavens, that is heaven, and the Lord's kingdom 
on earth, or the church; which signification of "land" or "earth" has been several times treated of before. That the kingdom in the heavens and on earth has been given to the Lord, is evident from 
various passages of the Word. As in Isaiah: </p>
<blockquote>
	<p>Unto us a Child is born, unto us a Son is given and the government shall be upon His shoulder; and His name shall be called Wonderful, Counselor, 
God, Hero, Father of eternity, Prince of Peace (Isa. 9:6). </p>
</blockquote>
<p>     In Daniel: </p>
<p>     I saw in the night visions, and behold one like the Son of man came with the clouds of heaven; and He came even to the Ancient 
of Days, and they brought Him near before Him. And there was given Him dominion, and glory, and a Kingdom; and all peoples, nations, and languages shall serve Him. His dominion is an everlasting dominion, 
which shall not pass away, and His kingdom that which shall not be destroyed (Dan7:13, 14). The Lord Himself also says the same in Matthew: </p>
<blockquote>
	<p>All things are delivered unto Me of My Father 
(Matt.11:27) also in Luke (10:22). </p>
</blockquote>
<p>     And again in Matthew: </p>
<blockquote>
	<p>All power [potestas] has been given unto Me in heaven and on earth (Matt. 28:18). 
	</p>
</blockquote>
<p>     In John: </p>
<p>     Thou gavest to the Son power [potestas] 
over all flesh, that whatsoever Thou hast given Him, to them He should give eternal life (Matt. 17:2, 3). The same is also signified by His "sitting at the right hand," as in Luke: </p>
<blockquote>
	<p>Now from 
henceforth shall the Son of man sit at the right hand of the power of God (Luke 22:69). 
	</p>
</blockquote>
<p>     [2] As regards all power being given unto the Son of man in the heavens and on earth, it is to be known that the 
Lord had power over all things in the heavens and on earth before He came into the world; for He was God from eternity and Jehovah, as He plainly says in John: </p>
<blockquote>
	<p>Now, O Father, glorify Thou Me with 
Thine own self, with the glow which I had with Thee before the world was (John 17:5);
	</p>
</blockquote>
<p>and again: </p>
<blockquote>
	<p>Verily, verily, I say unto you, before Abraham was, I am* (John 8:58); 
	</p>
</blockquote>
<p>for He was Jehovah and 
God to the Most Ancient Church that was before the flood, and was seen by them. He was also Jehovah and God to the Ancient Church that was after the flood. And it was He who has represented by all 
the rites of the Jewish Church, and whom they worshiped. But the reason He says that all power was given unto Him in heaven and on earth, as if it were then His for the first time, is that by "the Son 
of man" is meant His Human Essence; and this, when united to His Divine Essence, was also Jehovah, and at the same time had power; and this could not be the case until He had been glorified, that is, 
until by unition with the Divine Essence His Human Essence also had life in itself, and so became in like manner Divine and Jehovah; as He says in John: </p>
<blockquote>
	<p>As the Father hath life in Himself, so hath 
He given to the Son to have life in Himself (John 5:26). </p>
</blockquote>
<p>     3] It is His Human Essence, or external man, that is likewise called "Son of man" in Daniel, in the passage quoted above; and of which it 
is said in the passage quoted from Isaiah, "A Child is born and a Son is given to us." That the heavenly kingdom should be given to Him, and all power in the heavens and on earth, He now saw, and it 
was now promised Him; and this is signified by the words, "all the land which thou seest, to thee will I give it, and to thy seed after thee forever." This was before His Human Essence had been united 
to His Divine Essence, which was united when He had overcome the devil and hell, that is, when by His own power and His own might He had expelled all evil, which alone disunites. </p>

but elsewhere sum, as in n. 9315. </p>

That 'for all the land which you see I will give to you' means the heavenly kingdom which was to be the Lord's is clear from the meaning of 'land'- the land of Canaan in this context since the words 
used are 'the land which you see'- as the heavenly kingdom. Indeed the land of Canaan represented the Lord's kingdom in the heavens, which is heaven, and also the Lord's kingdom on earth, which is the 
Church. This meaning of 'land' has been discussed frequently already. That the kingdom in heaven and on earth was given to the Lord is clear from various places in the Word, as in Isaiah, </p>
<blockquote>
A Boy is 
born, a Son is given to us; and the government will be upon His shoulder, and His name will be called, Wonderful, Counsellor, God, Hero, Father of Eternity, Prince of Peace. <a href="http://bible.gospelcom.net/cgi-bin/bible?passage=Isa%209:6&amp;version=ESV&amp;interface=print&amp;showfn=yes&amp;showxref">Isa 9:6</a>. 
</blockquote>
<p>In Daniel, </p>
<blockquote>
I 
saw in the night visions, and behold with the clouds of the heavens One like the Son of Man was coming, and He came even to the Ancient of Days, and they brought Him near before Him. And to Him was 
given dominion and glory and kingdom, and all peoples, nations, and languages will serve Him. His dominion is an eternal dominion which will not pass away, and His kingdom one that will not perish. 
<a href="http://bible.gospelcom.net/cgi-bin/bible?passage=Dan%207:13,%2014&amp;version=ESV&amp;interface=print&amp;showfn=yes&amp;showxref">Dan 7:13, 14</a>. 
</blockquote>
<p>The Lord Himself also says the same: in Matthew, </p>
<blockquote>
All things have been delivered to Me by My Father. <a href="http://bible.gospelcom.net/cgi-bin/bible?passage=Matt%2011:27&amp;version=ESV&amp;interface=print&amp;showfn=yes&amp;showxref">Matt 11:27</a>; <a href="http://bible.gospelcom.net/cgi-bin/bible?passage=Luke%2010:22&amp;version=ESV&amp;interface=print&amp;showfn=yes&amp;showxref">Luke 10:22</a>. 
</blockquote>
<p>Elsewhere in Matthew, </p>
<blockquote>
[All] power in heaven and on 
earth has been given to Me. <a href="http://bible.gospelcom.net/cgi-bin/bible?passage=Matt%2028:18&amp;version=ESV&amp;interface=print&amp;showfn=yes&amp;showxref">Matt 28:18</a>. 
</blockquote>
<p>In John, </p>
<blockquote>
You have given to the Son power over all flesh in order that all You have given Him, to them He may give eternal life. <a href="http://bible.gospelcom.net/cgi-bin/bible?passage=John%2017:2,%203&amp;version=ESV&amp;interface=print&amp;showfn=yes&amp;showxref">John 17:2, 3</a>. 
</blockquote>
<p>And 'sitting 
on the right hand' has the same meaning, as in Luke, </p>
<blockquote>
From now on the Son of Man will be seated at the right hand of the power of God. <a href="http://bible.gospelcom.net/cgi-bin/bible?passage=Luke%2022:69&amp;version=ESV&amp;interface=print&amp;showfn=yes&amp;showxref">Luke 22:69</a>. 
</blockquote>
<p></p>
<p><b>[2]</b>
 As regards all power in heaven and on 
earth being given to the Son of Man, it should be recognized that the Lord already had power over all things in heaven and on earth before He came into the world, for He was God from eternity and He 
was Jehovah, as He Himself plainly declares in John, </p>
<blockquote>
Now, Father, glorify Me in Your Own Self with the glory I had with You before the world was. <a href="http://bible.gospelcom.net/cgi-bin/bible?passage=John%2017:5&amp;version=ESV&amp;interface=print&amp;showfn=yes&amp;showxref">John 17:5</a>. 
</blockquote>
<p>And in the same gospel, </p>
<blockquote>
Truly, Truly, 
I say to you, before Abraham was, I am.<A name="fntext1"></a><A href="#fn1"><sup>a</sup></a> <a href="http://bible.gospelcom.net/cgi-bin/bible?passage=John%208:58&amp;version=ESV&amp;interface=print&amp;showfn=yes&amp;showxref">John 8:58</a>. 
</blockquote>
<p>In fact He was Jehovah and God to the Most Ancient Church which existed before the Flood, and was seen by them. He was also Jehovah and God to 
the Ancient Church which existed after the Flood; and He was the One whom all the religious observances of the Jewish Church represented, and the One they worshipped. The reason the Lord says that all 
power in heaven and on earth has been given to Him, as though it had not been His till then, is that 'the Son of Man' is used to mean His Human Essence which became Jehovah as well after it had been 
united to His Divine Essence. Power was given to Him at that point, which would not have been possible until He was glorified, that is, until His Human Essence as well, through union with the Divine 
Essence, had life in Itself and likewise became Divine and Jehovah, as He Himself declares in John, </p>
<blockquote>
As the Father has life in Himself, so He has granted the Son to have life in Himself. <a href="http://bible.gospelcom.net/cgi-bin/bible?passage=John%205:26&amp;version=ESV&amp;interface=print&amp;showfn=yes&amp;showxref">John 5:26</a>. 
</blockquote>
<p></p>
<p><b>[3]</b>
It is His Human Essence or External Man that is named 'the Son of Man' in the passage quoted from Daniel, and 'a Boy born, a Son given to us' in the passage quoted from Isaiah. The fact that the 
heavenly kingdom would be given to Him, and all power in heaven and on earth, was shown and promised to Him then, and is the meaning of the statement 'all the land which you see I will give to you, 
and to your seed after you for ever'. This was before His Human Essence had been united to His Divine Essence, a union which took place when He had overcome the devil and hell, that is to say, when by 
His own strength and powers He had cast out all evil, which alone causes the severance.

aeternam, xvii 2, 3; </p>
<p>quod etiam significatur per 'sedere a dextris,' ut apud Lucam, 	Exhinc nunc erit Filius Hominis sedens a dextris virtutis Dei, xxii 69. [2]	Quod 'data sit Filio Hominis omnis 
potestas in caelis et in terris,' sciendum quod Domino fuerit potestas super omnia in caelis et in terris antequam venit in mundum, nam fuit Deus ab aeterno et Jehovah, sicut ipse clare dicit, apud Johannem, 	Nunc 
glorifica Me, Tu Pater, apud Te Ipsum, gloria, quam habui, antequam mundus esset, apud Te, xvii 5: </p>
<p>et apud eundem, 	Amen, Amen, dico vobis, priusquam Abrahamus fuit, Ego fui, viii 58; </p>
<p>fuit 
enim Jehovah et Deus Antiquissimae Ecclesiae quae ante diluvium, et illis visus; fuit etiam Jehovah et Deus Antiquae Ecclesiae quae post diluvium, et fuit Quem repraesentabant omnes ritus Ecclesiae 
Judaicae, et Quem colerent; at quod Ipse dicit, quod 'data Ipsi omnis potestas in caelo et in terra,' tanquam tunc primum, est quia per 'Filium Hominis' intelligitur Humana Ipsius Essentia quae 
cum unita fuit Divinae, etiam Jehovah fuit; et Ipsi simul potestas, quod fieri non potuit antequam glorificatus est, hoc est, antequam Humana Ipsius Essentia per unitionem cum Divina etiam vitam haberet 
in Se, et sic similiter facta Divina et Jehovah, ut Ipse dicit apud Johannem, 	Quemadmodum Pater habet vitam in Se ipso, etiam dedit Filio vitam habere in Se Ipso, v (x)26. [3] Humana Ipsius Essentia 
seu Externus Homo est qui quoque apud Danielem in loco citato appellatur 'Filius Hominis'; et apud Esaiam in loco citato, 'Puer natus est, et Filius datus est nobis': quod Ipsi daretur regnum caeleste, 
et omnis potestas in caelis et in terris, Ipsi nunc visum et promissum est, et significatur per haec verba, 'omnem terram quam tu vides, tibi dabo illam, et semini tuo post te in aeternum,' quod 
erat antequam Humana Ipsius Essentia unita fuit Ipsius Divinae, quae unita fuit cum diabolum et infernum evicit; nempe cum propria potentia et propriis viribus expulit omne malum, quod solum disunit.  </p>
