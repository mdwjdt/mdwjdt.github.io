<h3 align="center" class="ired">属天的奥秘 第4414节</h3>
<h4 align="center"></h4><p><strong>4414.</strong>在天堂，光的变化和构成天堂的天使社群一样多，甚至和每个社群里的天使一样多。原因在于，天堂照着良善与真理的一切变化，因而照着聪明和智慧的一切状态，进而照着从主接受光的各种方式而被排列得井然有序。结果，在整个天堂，光在各处并不完全一样；反而照着它以红和白被调和的各种方式，以及它的强烈程度而各不相同。因为聪明和智慧无非是对主所放射天堂之光的更高级的改变。</p>

<p align="center"><b>Potts(1905-1910) 4414</b></p><p><b>4414.</b>
The differences of light in the heavens are as many as are the angelic societies which constitute heaven, nay, they are as many as are the angels in each society. The reason is that heaven is ordered 
in accordance with all the differences of good and truth, thus in accordance with all states of intelligence and wisdom, and consequently in accordance with the various receptions of the light which 
is from the Lord. The result is that nowhere in the universal heaven is the light exactly the same as it is anywhere else in heaven, but on the contrary it differs according to the various ways in which 
it is tempered with a flaming or with a bright white quality, and also according to the various degrees of its intensity; for intelligence and wisdom are nothing but an eminent modification of the 
heavenly light which is from the Lord. </p>

<p align="center"><b>Elliott(1983-1999) 4414</b></p><p><b>4414.</b>
The variations of light in heaven are as many as the angelic communities which constitute heaven; indeed they are as many as the angels within each community. The reason why is that heaven is arranged 
into order conforming with all the variations there are of good and truth, and so conforming with all the states there are of intelligence and wisdom, and consequently with the ways that light from 
the Lord is received. This is the reason why in the whole of heaven the light is nowhere entirely the same but varies according to the different ways in which red and white enter into the composition 
of it, and according to degrees of intensity. For intelligence and wisdom are nothing other than the higher kind of modification of heavenly light which radiates from the Lord. </p>

</p><b>4414.</b>
(s) Lucis differentiae in caelo totidem sunt, quot sunt societates angelicae quae constituunt caelum, immo quot sunt angeli in quavis societate; causa est quia caelum ordinatum est secundum omnes 
differentias boni et veri, ita secundum omnes status intelligentiae et sapientiae, consequenter secundum receptiones lucis quae a Domino; inde est quod nullibi in universo caelo sit prorsus similis 
lux, sed differt secundum temperaturas cum flammeo et candido, et secundum gradus {1} intensionis; (o)nam intelligentia et sapientia non aliud est quam eminens modificatio lucis caelestis quae a Domino.
