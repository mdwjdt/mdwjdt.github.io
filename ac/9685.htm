<h3 align="center" class="ired">属天的奥秘 第9685节</h3>
<h4 align="center"></h4><p><strong>9685.</strong>“要把桌子安在北边”表住在模糊中的良善。这从“桌子”和“北”的含义清楚可知：摆放陈设饼或脸饼的“桌子”是指天上事物或赐福的一个容器（参看<a href="9527.htm">9527</a>节），因为“饼”是指来自主的属天良善（<a href="9545.htm">9545</a>节）；“北”是指就信之真理而言的模糊（<a href="3708.htm">3708</a>节），当真理处于模糊之中时，良善也处于模糊之中。因为在主的属灵国度，良善通过真理显现，当真理从理解力进入意愿时，它就被感觉为良善。这良善是对邻之仁的良善，被称为“属灵良善”。在主的属天国度则不然；在那里，良善不是通过真理而显为良善的；相反，那里的天使享有对良善本身的直接洞察。由此可见为何桌子朝北边安放，灯台朝南边安放。对于这些问题，可参看刚才的阐述和说明（<a href="9684.htm">9684</a>节）。</p>

<p align="center"><b>Potts(1905-1910) 9685</b></p><p><b>9685.</b>
And thou shalt bestow the table at the side of the north. That this signifies good in obscurity, is evident from the signification of "the table upon which were the breads of faces," as being a receptacle 
of celestial things (see n. 9527), for "the breads" denote celestial good which is from the Lord (n. 9545); and from the signification of "the north," as being obscurity in respect to the truths 
of faith (n. 3708) and when truth is in obscurity, good also is in obscurity; because in the Lord's spiritual kingdom good appears through truth, and truth is perceived as good when it comes from the 
understanding into the will. This good is the good of charity toward the neighbor, and is called "spiritual good." It is otherwise in the Lord's celestial kingdom; there good does not appear as good 
through truth, but is perceived from good itself. From this it can be seen why the table was placed on the side toward the north, and the lampstand on the side toward the south. But see what has been 
said and shown on this subject just above (n.9684). </p>

<p align="center"><b>Elliott(1983-1999) 9685</b></p><p><b>9685.</b>
'And you shall put the table on the north side' means good dwelling in obscurity. This is clear from the meaning of 'the table', on which the loaves of the Presence were laid, as a receptacle of heavenly 
blessings, dealt with in <a href="9527.htm">9527</a>, 'the loaves' being celestial good, which comes from the Lord, <a href="9545.htm">9545</a>; and from the meaning of 'the north' as obscurity so far as the truths of faith are concerned, dealt 
with in <a href="3708.htm">3708</a>, and since truth is in obscurity, so too is good. For in the Lord's spiritual kingdom good manifests itself by means of truth, and truth is perceived as good when it passes from the understanding 
into the will. This good is the good of charity towards the neighbour, and it is called spiritual good. It is different in the Lord's celestial kingdom. There good does not manifest itself 
as such by means of truth; rather those there enjoy direct insight into that good. From this it becomes clear why that table was placed on the side towards the north, and the lampstand on the side towards 
the south. But see what has been stated and shown immediately above in <a href="9684.htm">9684</a> on these matters.  </p>

</p><b>9685.</b>
Et mensam dabis ad latus septentrionis': quod significet bonum in obscuro, constat ex significatione `mensae super qua panes facierum' quod sit receptaculum caelestium, de qua n. 9527, panes enim sunt 
bonum caeleste, quod a Domino, n. 9545; et ex significatione `septentrionis' quod sit obscurum quoad vera fidei, de qua n. 3708; et quia {1} verum in obscuro est, ideo etiam bonum in obscuro est, nam 
in spirituali regno Domini bonum apparet per verum, et verum appercipitur ut bonum cum ab intellectu in voluntatem venit; hoc bonum est bonum charitatis erga proximum, et vocatur bonum spirituale; 
(m)aliter in regno caelesti Domini, ibi bonum non apparet bonum per verum, sed percipitur ex ipso bono;(n) inde constare potest cur mensa illa ad latus versus septentrionem posita fuit {2}, et candelabrum 
ad latus versus austrum; sed videantur quae de his mox supra {3} n. 9684 dicta et ostensa sunt. @1  uno cum I, una cum T$ @2 sit$ @3 d nunc supra i supra$ </p>
