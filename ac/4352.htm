<h3 align="center" class="ired">属天的奥秘 第4352节</h3>
<h4 align="center"></h4><p><strong>4352.</strong>“伏在他的颈项上”表包含在真理的普遍体现里面的一切事物的第二次结合。这从“伏在颈项上”的含义清楚可知，“伏在颈项上”是指更亲密的结合，因为这是一种更亲密的拥抱。此外，“颈项”在内义上表示内层与外层的流注和联系，因而表示结合（参看<a href="3542.htm">3542</a>，<a href="3603.htm">3603</a>节）。这是指一切事物，或在真理的普遍体现里面与一切事物的结合，因为雅各，就是此处的“他”所指的，表示各种真理的普遍体现（<a href="4346.htm">4346</a>节）。<br />此处描述的是良善与真理在属世层里面的结合，该结合的性质是这样：良善经由内在人流入外在人，在那里与经由外在人所引入的真理结合。因为经由内在人流入的良善是爱之良善；事实上，非爱之良善的良善并不存在，无论属灵的还是属天的。爱是这种良善的源头，由此被称为人里面的良善。在良善里面并与良善同在的爱本身就是那产生结合的。若非爱在里面并近在咫尺，绝无可能有任何结合；事实上，爱无非是属灵的结合，因为这结合是由爱产生的。这爱并非出自其它源头，唯源于主，因为主是一切属天和属灵之爱，因而由这爱所流出的一切良善的泉源和源头。这爱有两部分组成，即属天的和属灵的。属天之爱是对主之爱，属灵之爱是对邻之爱，被称为仁爱。这些就是一切属天和属灵之爱所源于，并与被称为信之真理的真理结合的那类爱。因为信之真理若不关注爱，纯粹是缺乏任何生命的声音而已；但通过爱，因而通过与爱之良善的结合，它们便接受生命。由此可以看出，除了在那些拥有爱之良善在里面的人当中外，信仰从来就不存在，并且信仰取决于爱。<br />由于除了在那些拥有爱之良善在里面的人当中外，信仰从来就不存在，所以信心或信靠也不存在。对那些没有爱与仁的人来说，被称为信仰的信靠或信心的信靠或信心要么是虚假的，要么是诸如甚至能存在于陷入恐惧或剧痛时的魔鬼灵身上的那种，要么是由爱自己和爱世界所产生的虚假说服。然而，如今没有仁之善行的信仰成为那带来拯救者，故人们远远地发现信之真理并没有拯救的能力，因为这些真理也存在于恶人当中。因此，他们承认信心或信靠，称这为信仰，却不知道它是什么，或这样的信心或信靠甚至在恶人当中也可能存在，或属灵的信心若不经由爱与仁之良善流入，就不存在。他们没有意识到以下事实：当一个人陷入恐惧或剧痛，或由爱自己和爱世界所产生的虚假说明时，这种属灵的信心是不会流入的，只有在他处于自由状态时才会流入。他们也没有意识到，属灵的信心只存在于那些良善已与真理结合，并在此前的生活期间就深深扎根下来的人当中，因而不存在于病痛、不幸、生命危险当中或临终之时。如果冲动状态下所显示的这种信心或信靠能拯救人，那么所有凡夫俗子都会得救；因为人人都能很轻易地获得这种信心，愿意所有人得救的主不会不把它赐给每个人。但就被称为信仰的信心或信靠而言，它是什么，是何性质，存在于哪些人当中，蒙主的神性怜悯，这一切将在别处予以讨论。</p>

And fell upon his neck. That this signifies a second conjunction of all things which are in that universal, is evident from the signification of "to fall upon the neck," as being closer conjunction, 
for it is a closer embrace. Moreover, by the "neck" is signified in the internal sense the influx and communication of the interiors with the exteriors, and the consequent conjunction (see n. 3542, 3603). 
That this denotes a conjunction of all things or with all things in that universal, is because Jacob, who is here meant by "his," denotes the universal of all things in respect to truths (n. 4346). 
 [2] The conjunction of good with truths in the natural is here described, with which the case is this: Good flows in through the internal man into the external, and there conjoins itself with the 
truths that have been instilled through the external man. For the good that flows in through the internal is of love, because there is not any spiritual and celestial good that is not of love, from this 
it is, and from this it is called good in man. The love itself which is in good and with good is that which conjoins. Unless love were within and present, there could not possibly be any conjunction; 
for love is nothing else than spiritual conjunction, because this is effected by it. The love is from no other source than the Lord, for He is the fountain and origin of all celestial and spiritual 
love, consequently of all the good thence derived. This love is twofold-celestial and spiritual. Celestial love is love to the Lord, and spiritual love is love toward the neighbor, which is called charity. 
It is these loves from which is all celestial and spiritual good, and which conjoin themselves with the truths which are called the truths of faith; for the truths of faith regarded without love 
are only words without life; but through love, and thus through conjunction with the good of love, they receive life. It may be seen from this, that there is never anything of faith except with those 
who are in the good of love, and that the faith is according to the love.  [3] And as there is never anything of faith except with those who are in the good of love, therefore neither is there any 
confidence or trust. With all those who are not in love and charity, the trust or confidence which is called the trust or confidence of faith, is either spurious, or such as is also possible with diabolical 
spirits when they are in a state of fear or of anguish, or in a state of persuasion from the love of self and of the world. But because at this day men have made faith saving without the goods 
of charity, and yet see from afar that the truths of faith cannot save, because these exist also with the wicked, therefore they acknowledge confidence and trust, and call this faith, not knowing what 
it is, and that it is possible even with the wicked, and that there is no spiritual confidence except that which flows in through the good of love and charity-not at the time when the man is in fear 
and anguish, or in persuasion from the love of self and of the world, but when he is in a state of freedom; and not with any but those in whom good has been conjoined with truths, and inrooted by the 
previous course of life; thus not in sickness, misfortunes, perils of life, or when death is at hand. If this confidence or trust which appears in a state of compulsion would save a man, all mortals 
would be saved; for to this kind of confidence everyone is easily reduced, and there are none to whom the Lord, who wills the salvation of all, would not impart it. But as regards the confidence or trust 
which is called faith-what this is, what is its nature and with whom it is found, will of the Lord's Divine mercy be told elsewhere. </p>

'And fell on his neck' means a second joining together involving everything included within that universal embodiment of truth. This is clear from the meaning of 'falling on the neck' as a closer joining 
together since it is a closer kind of embrace. Furthermore 'the neck' in the internal sense means the influx and communication of interior things with exterior, and therefore means a joining together 
of them, see <a href="3542.htm">3542</a>, <a href="3603.htm">3603</a>. The reason why this is a joining together of everything - or with everything - within that universal embodiment of truth is that Jacob, to whom 'his' refers here, means the 
universal embodiment of every kind of truth, <a href="4346.htm">4346</a>. </p>
<p></p>
<p><b>[2]</b>
 The joining together of good and truths within the natural is described here, and the nature of that joining together is as follows: Good flows 
by way of the internal man into the external man, where it joins itself to the truths which have been introduced by way of the external man. For the good which flows in by way of the internal man 
is the good of love; indeed no good exists, spiritual or celestial, which is not the good of love. Love is the source of such good and the reason why it is called good with man. It is the actual love 
present within good and going with good that effects any joining together. Unless love were present within and at hand no joining together would ever be possible, for love is nothing other than a spiritual 
joining together since it is love that brings it about. This love comes from nowhere else than the Lord, for He is the fountain and source of all celestial and spiritual love, and therefore of 
all good which flows from that love. That love is twofold, celestial and spiritual. Celestial love is love to the Lord, while spiritual love is love to the neighbour and is called charity These are the 
kinds of love from which all celestial or spiritual good is derived and which join themselves to truths which are called the truths of faith. For the truths of faith regarded without love are mere sounds 
devoid of any life; but through love, and so through being joined to the good of love, they receive life. From this it becomes clear that no measure of faith at all exists except with those who 
have the good of love in them, and that faith exists insofar as love is present. </p>
<p></p>
<p><b>[3]</b>
 And since no measure of faith at all exists except with those who have the good of love within them, neither therefore 
does any confidence or trust exist with them. With people other than those who have love and charity, trust or confidence which is called the trust or confidence of faith is either spurious or 
else the kind that can exist even with devil-spirits when subject to fear or to anguish, or else to false persuasion resulting from self-love and love of the world. However, even though at the present 
day faith without the good works of charity has been made the bringer of salvation, people in a remote way still see that the truths of faith have no power to save because those truths are known also 
by the evil Therefore they recognize confidence or trust, to which they give the name faith. They call it faith without being aware of what it really is, or that such is possible even with the evil, 
or that no spiritual confidence exists if it does not flow in by way of the good of love and charity. They are unaware of the fact that such spiritual confidence does not flow in when a person is subject 
to fear or anguish, or to false persuasion resulting from self-love and love of the world, but when he is in a state of freedom. Nor are they aware that spiritual confidence does not exist in people 
other than those with whom good has been joined to truths and become deeply rooted during the course of their lives prior to this, and so does not exist in cases of illness, misfortune, danger to life, 
or when death is at hand. If this confidence or trust which shows itself in a case of compulsion could save a person, then every mortal human being would be saved, for every one is brought with ease 
to that confidence; indeed there are none to whom the Lord - who desires the salvation of all - would not grant it. But regarding the confidence or trust which is called faith - what it is, the nature 
of it, and whom it exists with - this must in the Lord's Divine mercy be discussed elsewhere. </p>

`Et cecidit super collum ejus': quod significet conjunctionem (x)secundam omnium quae in illo universali, constat ex significatione `cadere super collum' quod sit arctior conjunctio, est enim arctior 
amplexatio; per `collum' etiam in sensu interno significatur influxus et communicatio interiorum et exteriorum et inde conjunctio, videatur n. 3542, 3603: quod sit conjunctio omnium seu cum omnibus 
in illo universali, est quia Jacob qui hic est `ejus,' est universale omnium quoad vera, n. 4346.  [2] Conjunctio boni cum veris in naturali hic describitur, cum qua ita se habet: bonum per internum 
hominem influit in externum, et ibi `se conjungit' cum veris quae per externum insinuata sunt; bonum enim quod per internum influit, est amoris, non enim datur aliquod bonum spirituale et caeleste 
quod non est {1} amoris, inde est, et inde dicitur bonum apud hominem; ipse amor qui est in bono et cum bono, est qui conjungit; nisi amor inesset et adesset, nusquam potuisset aliqua conjunctio 
dari, nam amor non aliud est quam conjunctio spiritualis quia per illum fit; amor ille non aliunde est quam ex Domino, nam ipse est fons et origo omnis amoris caelestis et spiritualis, proinde 
omnis boni inde; amor ille est duplex, caelestis et spiritualis, amor caelestis est amor in Dominum et amor spiritualis est amor erga proximum, qui charitas vocatur; illi amores sunt ex quibus omne 
bonum caeleste et spirituale, et qui conjungunt {2} se cum veris quae fidei dicuntur; </p>
<p>vera enim fidei absque amore spectata sunt modo voces absque vita, sed per amorem, ita per conjunctionem cum 
bono amoris, accipiunt vitam: inde constare potest quod nusquam aliquid fidei sit nisi apud illos qui in bono amoris sunt, et quod fides sit secundum amorem.  [3] Et quia nusquam aliquid fidei est 
nisi apud illos qui in bono amoris sunt, idcirco nec est aliqua confidentia aut fiducia; fiducia seu confidentia quae vocatur fidei, apud alios quam qui in amore et charitate sunt, est vel spuria, 
vel talis qualis etiam dari potest apud diabolicos spiritus cum in statu timoris aut angoris sunt, aut in statu persuasionis ex amore sui et mundi; sed quia hodie fidem absque bonis charitatis fecerunt salvificam, 
et usque e longinquo vident quod vera fidei non salvare possint, ex causa quia illa quoque dantur {3} apud malos, ideo confidentiam et fiduciam agnoscunt, (o)et illam vocant fidem, 
non scientes quid illa, et quod etiam apud malos dabilis, et quod nulla confidentia spiritualis sit nisi quae per bonum amoris et charitatis influit {4}, non tunc cum homo in timore et angore est, aut 
in persuasione ex amore sui et mundi sed cum in statu libero; </p>
<p>(m)nec apud alios quam apud quos bonum conjunctum veris est, et irradicatum per anteactum vitae curriculum, ita non in morbis, infortuniis, 
periculis vitae, ac instante morte; si illa {5} confidentia seu fiducia {6}, quae in coacto apparet, salvaret hominem, salvarentur omnes mortales, nam ad illam facile redigitur unusquisque, 
Dominus enim {7}, Qui omnium salutem vult, nullis non illam inderet;(n) sed de confidentia et fiducia {8} (o)quae vocatur fides, quid sit, qualis sit, et apud quos sit, ex Divina Domini Misericordia,
