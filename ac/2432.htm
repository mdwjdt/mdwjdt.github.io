<h4 align="center"></h4><p><strong>2432.</strong>“我的灵魂就得存活”表他或许因此得救。这也是显而易见的，无需解释。他也会得救，因为他的真理里面有良善，这从下文，也就是答复明显看出来，即“看哪，这事我也应允你，我不倾覆你所说的这城”（21节）；之后，“太阳已升出地面，罗得到了琐珥”（23节），这几句话表示拥有对真理的良善，即有信的人会得救，只要这信是善之信。</p>

And my soul shall live. That this signifies that so perchance he might be saved, is likewise evident without explication. That he also was saved, because there was good in his truth, is evident from 
what follows, namely, from the answer, "Behold, I have accepted thy face as to this word also, that I will not overthrow the city of which thou hast spoken" (verse 21); and afterwards, "The sun was gone 
forth upon the earth, and Lot came unto Zoar" (verse 23); by which is meant that they who are in the affection of truth, that is, who are in faith, are saved, provided it is the faith of good. </p>

That 'let my soul live' means he would thus perhaps be saved is also clear without explanation. He was saved also because his truth had good within it, as is clear from what follows, that is, from the 
reply, 'Behold, I have accepted you as regards this matter also, that I will not overthrow the city of which you have spoken', verse 21, and after that, 'The sun had gone forth over the earth, and Lot 
came to Zoar', verse 23, statements used to mean that people with the affection for truth are saved, that is, those with faith, provided that it is a faith grounded. in good. </p>

Quod `vivat anima mea' significet quod sic fortassis salvaretur, constat quoque absque explicatione; quod etiam salvatus sit quia in vero ejus esset bonum, constat ab illis quae sequuntur, nempe a responso 
`Ecce acceptavi faciem tuam etiam quoad verbum hoc, quod non evertam urbem de qua locutus,' vers. 21; et dein, `Se egressus super terram, et Lot venit Zoarem,' vers. 23, per qui intelligitur quod 
salventur illi qui in affectione veri, hoc est, qui i fide, modo sit fides boni. </p>
