<h3 align="center" class="ired">属天的奥秘 第7833节</h3>
<h4 align="center"></h4><p><strong>7833.</strong>“按着父家，一家一只羔羊”表按着各人良善的具体种类。这从“父家”的含义清楚可知，“父家”是指有别于另一家良善的这一家良善；因为“父家”表示内在良善方面的人（参看<a href="3128.htm">3128</a>节）。此中情形是这样：以色列的众支派表示整体上信与仁的一切真理和良善；每个支派表示良善或真理的一个属（<a href="3858.htm">3858</a>，<a href="3926.htm">3926</a>，<a href="3939.htm">3939</a>，<a href="4060.htm">4060</a>，<a href="6335.htm">6335</a>，<a href="6337.htm">6337</a>，<a href="6640.htm">6640</a>节）。因此，在一个支派里面的每个家族表示良善的一个具体种类，所以具体来说，一个家族的良善有别于另一个家族的良善。但在一个家族里面，父家表示属于一个具体种类的一种特定类型的良善。以色列人被划分为的各支派、家族和家庭之所以表示这些事物，是为了叫他们能代表天堂；因为在天堂，良善被划分为属、种类和类型，这些决定了天使彼此联结的方式。要知道，永远不可能有哪两个人的良善是完全相同的。相反，它们各种各样，并且如此地多样化，以致它们可划分为更高的总体类别，这些类别又可划分为较低的子类别，直到具体和最具体的种类。爱与信之良善就是如此地多样化（参看<a href="684.htm">684</a>，<a href="690.htm">690</a>，<a href="3241.htm">3241</a>，<a href="3267.htm">3267</a>，<a href="3744.htm">3744</a>-<a href="3746.htm">3746</a>，<a href="3986.htm">3986</a>，<a href="4005.htm">4005</a>，<a href="4149.htm">4149</a>，<a href="5598.htm">5598</a>，<a href="7236.htm">7236</a>节）。由此明显可知为何经上吩咐他们各人按着父家取一只羔羊，一家一只羔羊。</p>

For the house of his fathers, a lamb for the house. That this signifies according to the special good of each one, is evident from the signification of "the house of his fathers," as being the good of 
one family distinct from the good of another; for by "the house of a father" is signified man as to internal good (see n. 3128). The case herein is this. By all the tribes of Israel are signified all 
the truths and goods of faith and charity in one complex; and by each tribe one genus of good or truth (n. 3858, 3926, 3939, 4060, 6335, 6337, 6640); thus by each family within its tribe was signified 
a good of one species, consequently the good of one family specifically distinct from the good of another; but by the house of his fathers within a family was signified a particular good of one species. 
The reason why these things were signified by the tribes, the families, and the houses, into which the sons of Israel were distinguished, was that they might represent heaven; for goods are there 
distinguished into genera, species, and particulars, and the angels are conjoined in accordance with these. Be it known that the good of one is in no case exactly like the good of another; but that 
they are various, and so various that they are distinguished into universal higher genera, and these into lower, down to singulars and veriest singulars. (That the goods of love and of faith are so various, 
see n. 684, 690, 3241, 3267, 3744-3746, 3986, 4005, 4149, 5598, 7236.) From this it is now evident why it was commanded them to take to them every man a lamb for the house of his fathers, a lamb 
for a house. </p>

'According to the household of his fathers, a member of the flock according to the household' means according to each one's specific kind of good. This is clear from the meaning of 'household of fathers' 
as one family's good, distinct from another's good; for 'a father's house' means a person in respect of internal good, <a href="3128.htm">3128</a>. The implications of this are as follows: All the tribes of Israel mean 
all forms of the truth and good of faith and charity in their entirety, each tribe meaning one general kind of good or of truth, see <a href="3858.htm">3858</a>, <a href="3926.htm">3926</a>, <a href="3939.htm">3939</a>, <a href="4060.htm">4060</a>, <a href="6375.htm">6375</a>, <a href="6377.htm">6377</a>, <a href="6640.htm">6640</a>. Thus every separate family 
within a tribe meant a specific kind of good, and therefore the good of one specifically, distinct from another's good. But the household of the fathers within a family meant an individual type belonging 
to one specific kind. The reason why all these kinds of good were meant by the tribes, families, and households into which the children of Israel were divided was in order that they might represent 
heaven; for the varieties of good there are divided into general, specific, and individual. And these determine the ways in which angels are linked to one another. It should be recognized that one 
person's good is never exactly the same as another's good. Rather, they are varied, so varied that they can be distinguished into higher overall categories, and these into lower sub-divisions, down 
to particular and most particular kinds. Regarding forms of the good of love and faith, that they are so varied, see <a href="684.htm">684</a>, <a href="690.htm">690</a>, <a href="3241.htm">3241</a>, <a href="3267.htm">3267</a>, <a href="3744.htm">3744</a>-<a href="3746.htm">3746</a>, <a href="3986.htm">3986</a>, <a href="4005.htm">4005</a>, <a href="4149.htm">4149</a>, <a href="5598.htm">5598</a>, <a href="7236.htm">7236</a>. From this it may now 
be evident why they were commanded to take for themselves each one a member of the flock according to the household of his fathers, a member according to the household.  </p>

`Ad domum patrum, pecudem ad domum': quod significet secundum bonum speciale cujusvis, constat ex significatione `domus patrum' quod sit bonum unius familiae distinctum a bono alterius; per `domum' 
enim `patris' significatur homo quoad bonum internum {1}, n. 3128.  Cum hoc ita se habet: per `omnes tribus Israelis' significantur omnia vera et bona fidei et charitatis in uno complexu, et per `unamquamvis 
tribum' unum genus boni {2}aut veri, videatur n. 3858, 3926, 3939, 4060, 6335, 6337, 6640; ita per `unamquamvis familiam intra tribum suam' {3}significabatur bonum speciale, {4}proinde bonum unius 
in specie distinctum a bono alterius; {5}at per `domum patrum intra familiam' significabatur bonum particulare unius speciei; quod illa significata sint per tribus, {6}familias, et domos in quas 
distincti {7}erant filii Israelis, erat causa ut repraesentarent caelum, nam ibi bona sunt distincta in genere, in specie, et in particulari; et secundum illa conjuncti sunt angeli; sciendum quod unius 
bonum nusquam detur prorsus simile bono alterius, sed quod varia sint, et tam varia ut distincta sint in genera universalia superiora, et haec in {8} inferiora, usque ad singularia et singularissima; 
quod bona amoris et fidei tam varia sint, videatur n. 684, 690, 3241, 3267, 3744-3746, 3986, 4005, 4149, 5598, 7236.  Inde nunc patet cur mandatum quod `acciperent sibi quisque pecudem ad domum patrum, 
pecudem ad domum.' 	@1 i ejus$ 	@2 et$ 	@3 significatur$ 	@4 ita$ 	@5 hoc intelligitur per domum patrum$ 	@6 et per$ 	@7 fuerunt$ 	@8 i genera$ </p>
