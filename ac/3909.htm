<h3 align="center" class="ired">属天的奥秘 第3909节</h3>
<h4 align="center"></h4><p><strong>3909.</strong>“雅各的怒气就向拉结发作”表属世良善这一方的愤慨。这从“怒气发作”的含义和“雅各”的代表清楚可知：“怒气发作”是指愤慨，如下文所述；“雅各”是指属世层的良善，如前所述。之所以说“向拉结发作”，是因为“雅各”所代表的属世层的良善不能承认“拉结”所代表的内在真理。“怒气发作”在内义上表示愤慨，这是因为一切属世情感在上升到内层事物，也就是天堂时，都会逐渐变得更柔和，最终变成天堂的情感。事实上，字义上所呈现出来的观念，如此处的“怒气发作”，相对粗鄙，因为它们是属世和肉体的；但随着从肉体和属世人被提升向内在人或属灵人，它们逐渐变得温和、轻柔。<br />这也解释了为何字义具有这种性质，而内义却没有这种性质。因为字义适合属世人的理解，而内义则适合属灵人的理解。这表明“怒气发作”表示愤慨。真正的属灵愤慨，尤其属天的愤慨，根本不来源于属世人的怒气，而是来源于热忱的内心。就外在形式而言，这种热忱看似怒气，但就内在形式而言，却不是怒气，甚至也不是怒气所表达的愤慨，而是具有某事并非如此的祈愿的一种悲伤，就更为内在的形式而言，则只是因良善与真理在另一人中不存在而中断了天堂快乐的一种隐约的不快。</p>

And Jacob was kindled with anger against Rachel. That this signifies indignation on the part of natural good, is evident from the signification of "being kindled with anger," as being to be indignant 
(concerning which in what follows); and from the representation of Jacob, as being the good of the natural (concerning which above). It is said "against Rachel," because the interior truth represented 
by Rachel could not as yet be acknowledged in faith and act by the good of the natural which is "Jacob." That in the internal sense "to be kindled with anger" denotes to be indignant, is because every 
natural affection on ascending toward the interiors, or toward heaven, becomes more mild, and is at last changed into a heavenly affection. For the things that stand forth in the sense of the letter 
(as here "to be kindled with anger") are relatively harsh, because they are natural and corporeal, but they become mild and gentle as they are elevated from the corporeal and natural man to the internal 
or spiritual man. This is the reason why the literal sense is of this nature, being accommodated to the apprehension of the natural man; and why the spiritual sense is not of such a nature, being 
accommodated to the apprehension of the spiritual man. This shows that "to be kindled with anger" signifies to be indignant. Real spiritual indignation (and especially celestial indignation) derives 
nothing from the anger of the natural man, but from the interior essence of zeal; which zeal does indeed appear in the outward form like anger, but in internal form is not anger, nor even the indignation 
of anger; but is a certain sadness that is attended with a prayerful wish that it be not so; and in a form still more interior it is merely a certain obscure feeling that breaks in on the celestial 
delight on account of something not good and true in another. </p>

<p align="center"><b>Elliott(1983-1999) 3909</b></p><p><b>3909.</b>
'And Jacob flared up in anger against Rachel' means indignation on the part of natural good. This is clear from the meaning of 'flaring up in anger' as being indignant, dealt with below, and from the 
representation of 'Jacob' as the good of the natural, dealt with above. The phrase 'against Rachel' is used because interior truth represented by 'Rachel' was not yet able to be acknowledged in faith 
and action by the good of the natural, represented by 'Jacob'. The reason why in the internal sense 'flaring up in anger' means being indignant is that when any natural affection rises up towards interior 
things, that is, towards heaven, it mellows and is at length changed into a heavenly affection. Indeed the ideas that present themselves in the sense of the letter, such as 'flaring up in anger' 
here, are rather crude, being natural and bodily; but they mellow and soften as they are raised up from the bodily and natural man to the internal or spiritual man. </p>
<p></p>
<p><b>[2]</b>
 This also explains why the 
literal sense is such, but not the internal sense, in that the literal is accommodated to the mental grasp of the natural man, the internal to the mental grasp of the spiritual man. This shows that 'flaring 
up in anger' means being indignant. Truly spiritual indignation does not originate at all, and celestial still less so, in the anger of the natural man but in the inner heart of zeal. To outward 
appearance such zeal looks like anger, but inwardly it is neither anger nor even indignation expressing anger, but a kind of sorrow coupled with a wish that something should not be, and more inwardly 
still a kind of vague displeasure that interrupts heavenly delight because what is good and true does not exist in another. </p>

</p><b>3909.</b>
`Et accensus ira Jacob in Rachelem': quod significet indignationem a parte boni naturalis, constat a significatione `accendi ira' quod sit indignari, de qua sequitur; et a repraesentatione `Jacobi' 
quod sit bonum naturalis, de qua supra; </p>
<p>`in Rachelem' dicitur quia verum interius per Rachelem repraesentatum, a bono naturalis quod est Jacob, non adhuc agnosci fide et actu posset.  Quod ira accendi 
sit indignari in sensu interno, est quia omnis affectio naturalis cum versus interiora, seu versus caelum ascendit, mitior fiat, et tandem mutetur in affectionem caelestem; quae enim in sensu 
litterae exstant, ut hic `accendi ira,' sunt rudia respective, quia naturalia et corporea, sed mitia et lenia fiunt sicut a corporeo et naturali homine ad internum seu spiritualem elevantur; {1}inde 
est, quod sensus litteralis {2}sit talis quia ad captum naturalis hominis, et sensus internus non talis quia ad captum spiritualis hominis, accommodatus est; inde patet quod per `accendi ira' significetur 
indignari; ipsa indignatio spiritualis, minus caelestis, nec trahit aliquid ab ira naturalis hominis, sed ab interiore essentia zeli, qui nempe zelus, in externa forma apparet sicut ira, 
sed in interna non est ira, ne quidem indignatio irae, sed est triste quoddam tum votivo ut non ita sit, et in forma adhuc interiore est modo obscurum quoddam quod jucundum caeleste interpolat ex 
non bono et vero apud alium. @1 i quoque$ @2 i Verbi$ </p>
