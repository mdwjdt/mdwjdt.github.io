<h3 align="center" class="ired">属天的奥秘 第6197节</h3>
<h4 align="center"></h4><p><strong>6197.</strong>每当有东西进入我的思维和意愿的渴望，我却不知道它的源头，并且我想知道这个源头时，它就被指示给我，也就是说，我被指示它来自哪些社群，有时被指示它来所藉由的使臣是哪些灵人。在这种时候，这些灵人还与我交谈，并坦承他们正在思考那件事；他们还知道它正流入我，在我看来似乎就存在于我里面。出现在头顶上的诡诈灵人有时如此巧妙地流入我，以致我不知道这流注来自何处，并且几乎察觉不到别的，只感觉所流入的东西在我自己里面，就来自我自己，如其他人通常的情形。但我非常清楚地知道，它来自另外一个源头；因为主所赐予我的觉知如此敏锐，以致我能洞察从那些诡诈的灵人所流入之物的每一个细节，以及他们在哪里，究竟是谁。当他们意识到这一点时，尤其想到我能反思我的思维来自他们，就非常恼火。这种反思通过天使流入我。<br />这些诡诈的灵人主要灌输诸如反对主的那类观念；在这种时候，我也被引导反思以下事实：在地狱，没有人承认主；他们虽不介意听见有人提及父，宇宙的创造者，但却极尽所能地向祂说傲慢的话，满了恶言恶语。这次经历是一个非常明显的迹象，清楚表明正是主掌管整个天堂，正如祂自己在马太福音中所教导的：<br />天上地上所有的权柄都赐给我了。（马太福音<a href="http://39-27.cn/太28.18.htm">28:18</a>）<br />还表明，这些灵人反对主，因为他们反对天堂，而在天堂，主是全部中的全部。</p>

As often as anything has fallen into my thought and the desires of my will, the source of which I have not known, so often when I have desired to know the source, I have been shown from what societies 
it came, and sometimes through what spirits as subjects. They have also then spoken with me, and confessed that they were thinking that thing, and likewise that they knew that it flowed in with me and 
appeared to me as in myself. The deceitful, who appear directly above the head, have occasionally flowed in with me with such subtlety that I knew not whence the influx was, and also that I scarcely 
perceived any otherwise than that what flowed in was in myself and from myself, as is usual with others. But as I knew of a certainty that it was from another source, perception was given me by the 
Lord so exquisite that I perceived each single influx from them, also where they were and who they were. When they observed this, they were very indignant, especially because I reflected upon what came 
from them. This reflection flowed in through angels. Those deceitful ones chiefly insinuated such things as were contrary to the Lord; and then it was given me to reflect upon the fact that no one in 
hell acknowledges the Lord; but that insofar as they may, they are full of abuse of Him; yet they are not unwilling to hear mention made of the Father, the Creator of the universe. From this very plain 
indication it is evident that it is the Lord who rules the universal heaven, as He Himself teaches in Matthew: "All power is given unto Me in heaven and in earth" (Matt. 28:18); and that they are 
opposed to the Lord because they are opposed to heaven, where the Lord is all in all. </p>

As often as anything which I have not known the source of has entered my thinking or the desires of my will and I have wished to know the source, it has been shown me. That is to say, I have been shown 
which communities it came from, and sometimes which spirits were their agents through whom it came. Those spirits have also talked to me at such times and have confessed that they were thinking about 
that particular matter and that they also knew it was coming to me and seemed to me to exist within me. Deceitful ones, who are visible directly overhead, have come to me, sometimes in such a clever 
way that I did not know where the influx came from, and I could hardly discern what flowed in as anything else than something that existed in and originated with me, as is ordinarily so with others. 
But as I knew quite definitely that it originated somewhere else, the Lord granted me a perception which was so keen that I discerned every detail of what flowed in from those deceitful spirits. I also 
discerned exactly where they were and exactly who they were. When they realized this they were highly indignant, especially at the idea that I could reflect on the fact that my thought had originated 
with them. That reflection came to me by way of the angels. </p>
<p></p>
<p><b>[2]</b>
 In particular the deceitful spirits instilled ideas such as were opposed to the Lord, and on these occasions I was also led to reflect 
that no one in hell acknowledges the Lord, and that they speak as insolently against Him as they are allowed to, though they do not mind hearing mention made of the Father, the creator of all things. 
This experience, which is a very clear sign, makes it quite plain that the Lord is the One who reigns over the whole of heaven, as He Himself teaches in Matthew, </p>
<blockquote>
All power in heaven and on earth 
has been given to Me. <a href="http://bible.gospelcom.net/cgi-bin/bible?passage=Matt%2028:18&amp;version=ESV&amp;interface=print&amp;showfn=yes&amp;showxref">Matt 28:18</a>. 
</blockquote>
<p>It also shows that those spirits are opposed to the Lord because they are opposed to heaven, in which the Lord is the All in all. </p>

Quoties aliquid in cogitationem et in desideria voluntatis inciderat quod non scivi unde illud, toties cum id volui scire, mihi ostensum est unde, nempe a quibus societatibus, et quandoque per quos 
spiritus qui subjecta; et quoque tunc locuti sunt mecum et fassi quod id cogitaverint et quoque quod sciverint quod illud influeret apud me, et mihi appareret sicut in me.  Dolosi qui supra caput directe 
apparent, influxerunt apud me quandoque tam subtiliter ut nescirem unde esset, et quoque ut vix aliter perciperem quam quod illud quod influebat, esset in me et a me, ut familiare est aliis; sed quia 
pro certo sciebam quod aliunde, data est mihi perceptio a Domino tam exquisita ut apperciperem singulos eorum influxus, tum ubinam essent et quinam essent; cum hoc animadverterent, indignati sunt 
valde, imprimis quod reflecterem super id quod ab illis; reflexio illa influebat per angelos.  [2]Dolosi illi imprimis insinuabant talia quae erant contra Dominum, et tunc quoque reflectere dabatur super 
id quod nullus in inferno agnoscat Dominum, sed quod contra {1}Illum contumeliosi sint quantum eis licet, at quod non illibenter audiant nominari Patrem creatorem universi; inde, ut ex indicio perquam 
manifesto, patere potest quod Dominus sit Qui regit universum caelum sicut Ipse docet apud Matthaeum, Data est Mihi omnis potestas in caelo et in terra, xxviii 18;  et quod Domino oppositi sint, 
quia oppositi sunt caelo ubi Dominus est Omne in omnibus. @1 I i full stop; evident error$ </p>
