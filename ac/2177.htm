<h3 align="center" class="ired">属天的奥秘 第2177节</h3>
<h4 align="center"></h4><p><strong>2177.</strong>“细面饭”表当时主所具有理性的属灵成分和属天成分，“饼”（cakes）同样表属灵成分和属天成分，只是此时这二者已联结在一起。这从代表性教会的祭物以及那时所用的素祭非常清楚地看出来，素祭是用面调油做成饼制成的。代表性敬拜主要在于燔祭和祭物。至于这些代表什么，这在论述“饼”的地方（<a href="2165.htm">2165</a>节）早已说明，也就是说燔祭和祭物代表主在天上国度和地上国度（即教会）的属天事物，以及每个人所具有的主国度或教会的事物，一般代表爱与仁的一切事物，因为这些都是属天实体。那时，所有这些祭物都叫做“饼”（bread），包括素祭和这些祭物，以及奠酒。如前所述，素祭是由面调油，加上乳香制成的。<br />至于后面这些代表什么，这也是显而易见的。也就是说，它们所代表的事物类似于祭物所代表的，只是属于低等次的。因此，它们代表属于属灵教会的事物，以及属外在教会的事物。谁都能看出，若非这类事物代表神性事物，并且每一种都代表某种特定事物，经上决不会对它们作出规定。因为它们若不代表神性事物，那就和外邦人所用的类似事物没什么两样。外邦人也有祭物，如素祭、奠酒、乳香，常烧着的火，以及许多其它事物，它们都是从古教会，尤其从希伯来教会传下来的。但由于这些外邦人的仪式脱离了内在事物，就是它们所代表的神性事物，所以这些敬拜的外在形式无非是偶像崇拜。这和它们在犹太人中的情形一样，犹太人同样沦落到各种偶像崇拜中。由此可见，每一个仪式，尤其祭物及其一切细节里面都有天堂的奥秘。<br />至于素祭及其性质，以及它如何被作成饼，这在摩西五经中有整章的论述（利未记2，民数记15等）。在利未记中，经上用下面这些话描述了有关素祭的条例：<br />在坛上必有常常烧着的火，不可熄灭。素祭的条例乃是这样：亚伦的子孙要在坛前，把这祭献在耶和华面前。祭司要从其中，就是从素祭的细面中，取出自己的一把，又要取些油和素祭上所有的乳香，烧在坛上，奉给耶和华为馨香素祭的纪念。所剩下的，亚伦和他子孙要吃，必在圣处不带酵而吃，要在会幕的院子里吃。烤的时候，不可搀酵，这是从所献给我的火祭中赐给他们的分，是至圣的。（利未记<a href="http://39-27.cn/利6.13.htm">6:13</a>-<a href="http://39-27.cn/利6.17.htm">17</a>）<br />在坛上常常烧着的火代表主的爱，即祂的怜悯，它是永恒不变的。在圣言中，“火”表爱（参看<a href="934.htm">934</a>节），因此，“为馨香的火祭”表主喜悦那些属于爱与仁之物。“馨香之气”表良善的喜悦，即令人愉悦之物，也就是恩典之物（参看<a href="925.htm">925</a>，<a href="1519.htm">1519</a>节）。“取一把”代表他们被要求尽性尽力去爱，因为手或手掌表能力，如前所示（<a href="878.htm">878</a>节），“把”（handful）也由此表能力。细面，连同油和乳香代表仁爱的一切事物：“细面”代表仁爱的属灵成分，“油”代表仁爱的属天成分，“乳香”代表以这种方式令人愉悦之物。“细面”代表属灵成分，这从刚才以及下面所述明显可知。“油”代表属天成分，或良善、仁爱（参看<a href="886.htm">886</a>节），“乳香”因其馨香之气而代表恩典和蒙悦纳之物（参看<a href="925.htm">925</a>节）。<br />它是“无酵饼”或不发酵，表示它必是纯正的，因而是出于真心，没有任何不洁。“亚伦及其子孙要吃剩下的”代表人的回应，并且他使其成为自己的，因而代表藉着爱与仁的结合。因此缘故，他们被要求在“圣处”吃。因此，它被称作“至圣的”。这些就是素祭所代表的事物；代表物本身在天堂就是以这种方式被感知的；当教会成员如此理解它们时，他的观念就与天使的领悟类似，以至于他就处于主在天上的国度中，尽管他在世上。<br />关于素祭的更多论述，如它与每种祭物有何关联，当如何被作成饼，以及那些正被洁净之人要献哪种素祭，在其它场合当献哪种等等，在此介绍和解释起来太过冗长。不过，关于所有这些事，可参看相关经文（出埃及记<a href="http://39-27.cn/出29.39.htm">29:39</a>-<a href="http://39-27.cn/出29.41.htm">41</a>；利未记<a href="http://39-27.cn/利5.11.htm">5:11</a>-<a href="http://39-27.cn/利5.13.htm">13</a>；<a href="http://39-27.cn/利6.14.htm">6:14</a>-<a href="http://39-27.cn/利6.23.htm">23</a>；<a href="http://39-27.cn/利10.12.htm">10:12</a>-<a href="http://39-27.cn/利10.13.htm">13</a>；<a href="http://39-27.cn/利23.10.htm">23:10</a>-<a href="http://39-27.cn/利23.13.htm">13</a>，<a href="http://39-27.cn/利23.16.htm">16</a>-<a href="http://39-27.cn/利23.17.htm">17</a>；民数记<a href="http://39-27.cn/民5.15.htm">5:15</a>等；<a href="http://39-27.cn/民6.15.htm">6:15</a>-<a href="http://39-27.cn/民6.17.htm">17</a>，<a href="http://39-27.cn/民6.19.htm">19</a>-<a href="http://39-27.cn/民6.20.htm">20</a>，七章数处；<a href="http://39-27.cn/民28.5.htm">28:5</a>，<a href="http://39-27.cn/民28.8.htm">8</a>，<a href="http://39-27.cn/民28.9.htm">9</a>，<a href="http://39-27.cn/民28.12.htm">12</a>-<a href="http://39-27.cn/民28.13.htm">13</a>，<a href="http://39-27.cn/民28.20.htm">20</a>-<a href="http://39-27.cn/民28.21.htm">21</a>，<a href="http://39-27.cn/民28.28.htm">28</a>-<a href="http://39-27.cn/民28.29.htm">29</a>；<a href="http://39-27.cn/民29.3.htm">29:3</a>-<a href="http://39-27.cn/民29.4.htm">4</a>，<a href="http://39-27.cn/民29.9.htm">9</a>-<a href="http://39-27.cn/民29.10.htm">10</a>，<a href="http://39-27.cn/民29.14.htm">14</a>-<a href="http://39-27.cn/民29.15.htm">15</a>，<a href="http://39-27.cn/民29.18.htm">18</a>，<a href="http://39-27.cn/民29.21.htm">21</a>，<a href="http://39-27.cn/民29.24.htm">24</a>，<a href="http://39-27.cn/民29.27.htm">27</a>，<a href="http://39-27.cn/民29.30.htm">30</a>，<a href="http://39-27.cn/民29.33.htm">33</a>，<a href="http://39-27.cn/民29.37.htm">37</a>）。<br />作成饼的细面一般和“饼”（bread）所代表的一样，即代表爱的属天成分，而“饭”（meal）代表爱的属灵成分。这从上述经文明显可知。被称为“陈设饼”的饼或烤饼（loaves）是用细面作的，它们被作成饼，并被摆在桌子上，以不断代表主对全人类的爱，即怜悯，以及人的回应。关于这些烤饼或饼，我们在摩西五经中读到：<br />你要取细面，烤成十二个饼，每饼用面伊法十分之二。要把饼摆列两行，每行六个，在耶和华面前洁净的桌子上。又要把净乳香放在每行饼上，作为纪念的饼，就是作为火祭献给耶和华。每安息日要常依次摆在耶和华面前，这为以色列人作永远的约。这饼是要给亚伦和他子孙的，他们要在圣处吃，为永远的定例，因为在献给耶和华的火祭中，这饼是至圣的。（利未记<a href="http://39-27.cn/利24.5.htm">24:5</a>-<a href="http://39-27.cn/利24.9.htm">9</a>）<br />此处每个条例及其最小细节都代表爱与仁的圣洁，“细面”（fine flour）和 “细面饭”（meal of fine flour）所代表的一样，即都代表属天之物及其属灵之物，而“饼”（cake）代表结合在一起的这二者。<br />由此清楚可知，对那些拥有天堂观念的人而言，何为圣言的圣洁，甚至这样具体的代表仪式都具有何等的圣洁，它由此被称为“至圣的”。反之，对那些以为这些事物没有任何天堂之物，唯独拘守于外在之人而言，圣言何等缺乏圣洁。如有些人感觉饭纯是饭，细面纯是细面，饼纯是饼，并且以为所陈述的这些事物没有一个细节包含某种神性事物。这些人的态度和那些以为圣餐的饼和酒无非是一种仪式，里面并没有任何神圣事物之人的一样。然而事实上，当他们出于内在情感思想饼和酒表示主的爱和人的回应，并且凭内在思维和情感处于圣洁时，圣餐所具有的这类圣洁就会将人类的心智与天堂的心智结合起来。<br />下面的条例也一样，即以色列人在进入迦南地时，要用初熟的麦子磨面作饼，作举祭献给耶和华（民数记<a href="http://39-27.cn/民15.20.htm">15:20</a>）。所表示的是这类事物，这也明显可见于先知书，我们在此仅从以西结书引用这段经文：<br />这样，你就有金银的妆饰，穿的是细麻衣和丝绸并绣花衣；吃的是细面、蜂蜜并油。你也极其美貌，发达到王后的尊荣。（以西结书<a href="http://39-27.cn/结16.13.htm">16:13</a>）<br />这论及耶路撒冷，它表示教会，这教会在最初的日子具有这样的形像，也就是说，古教会用衣裳和许多其它装饰来描述；它对真理和良善的情感还被描述为“细面，蜂蜜并油”。谁都能看出，所有这些事物在内义上所表示的事物完全不同于它们在字面上所表示的。亚伯拉罕对撒拉所说的这些话也是如此，即“快准备三斗细面饭，和一和，作些饼”。“三”表神圣之物，如前所示（<a href="720.htm">720</a>，<a href="901.htm">901</a>节）。</p>

That the "meal of fine flour" denotes the spiritual and the celestial which were then with the Lord, and that "cakes" denote the same when both are conjoined, is very evident from the sacrifices of the 
Representative Church, and from the meat-offering then made use of, which consisted of fine flour mingled with oil and made into cakes. The chief part of representative worship consisted in burnt-offerings 
and sacrifices. What these represented has already been stated, where bread is treated of (n. 2165), namely, the celestial things of the Lord's kingdom in the heavens and of the Lord's kingdom 
on the earth (that is, in the church), and also those of the Lord's kingdom or church with each person; and in general all the things of love and charity, because these are celestial. All these offerings 
and sacrifices were at that time called "bread," and to them was adjoined the meat-offering also, which, as already said, consisted of fine flour mingled with oil, to which frankincense was likewise 
added, as well as a libation of wine. [2] What these represented is also evident, namely, similar things as the sacrifices, but in a less degree, thus the things which are of the spiritual church, 
and likewise those of the external church. Everyone can see that such things would never have been commanded unless they had represented Divine things, and also that each one represents something special 
and peculiar, for unless they had represented Divine things, they would not have differed from similar things in use among the Gentiles, among whom also there were sacrifices - meat-offerings, 
libations, frankincense, perpetual fires, and many other things, derived to them from the Ancient Church, and especially from the Hebrew Church. But as internal things (that is, the Divine things that 
were represented) were separated from these Gentile rites, they were merely idolatrous, as also they became with the Jews, who for this reason fell into all kinds of idolatry. From what has been said 
everyone can see that there were heavenly arcana in every rite, especially in the sacrifices and all their particulars. [3] As regards the meat-offering, the nature of it and how it was to be prepared 
into cakes, is described in a whole chapter in Moses (Lev. 2; also in Num. 15, and elsewhere). The law of the meat-offering is described in Leviticus in these words: </p>
<p>     Fire shall be kept burning 
upon the altar continually, it shall not go out. And this is the law of the meat-offering: the sons of Aaron shall bring it before Jehovah to the faces of the altar; and he shall take therefrom his 
handful of the fine flour of the meat-offering, and of the oil thereof, and all the frankincense which is upon the meat-offering, and shall burn it upon the altar, an odor of rest, for a memorial unto 
Jehovah; and the residue thereof Aaron and his sons shall eat; unleavened shall they be eaten in a holy place; in the court of the tent of meeting shall they eat it. It shall not be baked leavened; I 
have given it as their portion of My offerings made by fire; it is a holy of holies (Lev. 6:13-17). [4] The fire which must be kept burning upon the altar continually, represented the love, that is, 
the mercy of the Lord, perpetual and eternal. That in the Word "fire" signifies love, see n. 934; hence "offerings made by fire for an odor of rest" signify the Lord's pleasure in the things which are 
of love and charity. (That "odor" denotes what is well-pleasing, that is, what is grateful, see n. 925, 1519.) Their "taking a handful" represented that they should love with all the strength, or with 
all the soul; for the hand, or the palm of the hand, signifies power (as shown n. 878), from which "handful" also signifies power. The fine flour, with the oil and the frankincense, represented all 
things of charity-the fine flour the spiritual, and the oil the celestial of charity, the frankincense what was in this manner grateful. (That fine flour represents what is spiritual, is evident from 
what has just been said, and from what follows; that oil represents what is celestial, or the good of charity, may be seen above, n. 886; and also that frankincense, from its odor, represents what is 
grateful and acceptable, n. 925.) [5] Its being "unleavened," or not fermented, signifies that it should be sincere, and thus from a sincere heart, and free from uncleanness. That Aaron and his sons 
should eat the residue, represented man's reciprocality and his appropriation, thus conjunction through love and charity; on which account it was commanded that they should eat it in a holy place. Hence 
it is called a "holy of holies." These were the things that were represented by the meat-offering; and the representatives themselves were so perceived in heaven; and when the man of the church so 
apprehended them, he was then in an idea similar to the perception of the angels, thus he was in the Lord's kingdom itself in the heavens although he was on earth. [6] The meat-offering is further treated 
of, as regards what it ought to be in connection with each kind of sacrifice, and how it should be baked into cakes, also what kind should be offered by those who were being cleansed, and what 
on other occasions; to mention and explain all of which would be too tedious; but concerning all these matters see Exod. 29:39-41; Lev. 5:11-13; 6:14-23; 10:12-13; 23:10-13, 16-17; Num. 5:15, etc.; 6:15-17, 
19-20, chapter 7, in several places; 28:5, 7, 9, 12-13, 20-21, 28-29; 29:3-4, 9-10, 14-15, 18, 21, 24, 27, 30, 33, 37. [7] Fine flour made into cakes in general represented the same as bread, 
namely, the celestial of love, and meal the spiritual of it, as is evident from the passages cited above. The "breads" [or loaves] that were called the "bread of faces," or the "show bread" [panis propositionis], 
were made of fine flour, which was prepared in cakes and placed upon the table, for a perpetual representation of the love, that is, the mercy, of the Lord toward the universal human race, 
and the reciprocality of man. Concerning these loaves we read as follows in Moses: </p>
<p>     Thou shalt take fine flour and shalt bake it into twelve cakes; of two tenths shall one cake be; and thou shalt 
set them in two rows, six in a row, upon the clean table, before Jehovah; and thou shalt put pure frankincense upon each row, and it shall be to the breads for a memorial, an offering made by fire 
unto Jehovah. On every Sabbath day he shall set it in order before Jehovah continually, from the sons of Israel in a covenant of eternity. And it shall be for Aaron and his sons, and they shall eat it 
in a holy place, for it is a holy of holies unto him, of the offerings made by fire unto Jehovah by a statute of eternity (Lev. 24:5-9). Every particular in this description and all the smallest details 
represented the holy of love and of charity, the "fine flour" the same as the "meal of fine flour," namely, the celestial and its spiritual, and the "cake" the two conjoined. [8] Hence it is evident 
what is the holiness of the Word to those who are in heavenly ideas, nay, what holiness there was in this very representative rite, on account of which it is called a holiness of holinesses; and 
on the contrary, how void of holiness it is to those who suppose that there is nothing heavenly in these things, and who abide solely in the externals; as do they who perceive the meal here merely as 
meal, the fine flour as fine flour, and the cake as a cake, and who suppose these things to have been stated without each particular involving something of the Divine. These do in like manner as do those 
who think the bread and wine of the Holy Supper to be nothing but a certain rite, containing nothing holy within; whereas there is such holiness that human minds are by that Supper conjoined with 
heavenly minds, when from internal affection they are thinking that the bread and wine signify the Lord's love and the reciprocality of man, and are thus in holiness from interior thought and feeling. [9] 
The like was involved in that the sons of Israel on their coming into the land of Canaan were to offer a cake of the first of their dough, as a heave-offering unto Jehovah (Num. 15:20). That such 
things are signified is also evident in the Prophets, from which we may at present adduce only this from Ezekiel: </p>
<p>     Thou wast decked with gold and silver; and thy raiment was fine linen and silk, 
and broidered work; thou didst eat fine flour, honey, and oil, and thou wast become beautiful very exceedingly, and thou wast prospered unto a kingdom (Ezek. 16:13); </p>
<p>where the subject treated of is 
Jerusalem, by which is signified the church, that was so decked in its earliest time-that is, the Ancient Church-and which is described by the garments and other ornaments; as also its affections of 
truth and good by the fine flour, honey, and oil. Everyone can see that all these things have a very different meaning in the internal sense from that in the sense of the letter. And so have these words 
which Abraham said to Sarah: "Make ready quickly three measures of the meal of fine flour, knead, and make cakes." (That "three" signifies holy things has been shown before, n. 720, 901.) </p>

<p align="center"><b>Elliott(1983-1999) 2177</b></p><p><b>2177.</b>
That 'meal of fine flour' means the spiritual and celestial ingredients [of the rational] which were present at that time with the Lord, and 'cakes' the same when both had been joined together, is quite 
clear from the sacrifices of the representative Church and from the minchah presented at the same time, which consisted of fine flour mixed with oil and made into cakes. Representative worship consisted 
primarily in burnt offerings and sacrifices. What these represented has been stated above where 'bread' was the subject, in <a href="2165.htm">2165</a>, namely the celestial things of the Lord's kingdom in heaven and 
of the Lord's kingdom on earth, which is the Church, and also the things of the Lord's kingdom or Church as it exists with every individual, and in general everything that is in essence love and charity, 
since these are celestial entities. In those times all the sacrifices were called 'bread'. Along with those sacrifices a minchah was included - which, as has been stated, consisted of fine flour 
mixed with oil to which also incense was added - and also a wine-offering. </p>
<p></p>
<p><b>[2]</b>
 What these latter represented becomes clear too, namely things similar to those represented by sacrifices but of a lower 
order, thus the things which belong to the spiritual Church, and also those which belong to the external Church. It may become clear to anyone that such things would never have been prescribed unless 
they had represented Divine things, and also that each one represented some specific thing. For unless they had represented Divine things they would have been no different from similar things found 
among gentiles, among whom also there were sacrifices, minchahs, libations, and incense, as well as perpetual fires and many other things which had come down to them from the Ancient Church, especially 
from the Hebrew Church. But because they were separated from the internal, that is, the Divine things represented by them, those external forms of worship were nothing but idolatrous, as they also 
came to be among the Jews, who likewise sank into all kinds of idolatry. From this it may become clear to anyone that heavenly arcana were present within every form of ritual, especially so within the 
sacrifices and every detail of them. </p>
<p></p>
<p><b>[3]</b>
 As regards the minchah, the nature of it and how it was to be made into cakes is described in a whole chapter in Moses - in Lev. <a href="2.htm">2</a>; also Num. <a href="15.htm">15</a>, and elsewhere. 
The law regarding the minchah is described in Leviticus in the following words, </p>
<blockquote>
Fire shall be kept burning unceasingly on the altar; it shall not be put out. And this is the law of the minchah: 
Aaron's sons shall bring it before Jehovah to the front of the altar, and he shall take up from it a fistful of fine flour of the minchah and of the oil of it and all the frankincense which is on the 
minchah, and he shall burn it on the altar; it is an odour of rest for a memorial to Jehovah. And the rest of it Aaron and his sons shall eat. Unleavened bread shall be eaten in a holy place. In the 
court of the tent of meeting shall they eat it. It shall not be cooked leavened; I have given it as their portion from My fire-offerings; it is most holy. <a href="http://bible.gospelcom.net/cgi-bin/bible?passage=Lev%206:13-17&amp;version=ESV&amp;interface=print&amp;showfn=yes&amp;showxref">Lev 6:13-17</a>. 
</blockquote>
<p></p>
<p><b>[4]</b>
 The fire which was to 
be kept burning unceasingly on the altar represented the Lord's love, that is, His mercy, which is constant and eternal. 'Fire' in the Word means love, see <a href="934.htm">934</a>, and therefore 'the fire-offerings made 
for an odour of rest' means the good pleasure which the Lord takes in those things that belong to love and charity. That 'odour' means good pleasure, that is, that which is pleasing, see <a href="925.htm">925</a>, <a href="1519.htm">1519</a>. Their 
'taking a fistful' represented their being required to love with all their soul or strength, for 'the hand' or 'the palm' of the hand means power, as shown in <a href="878.htm">878</a>, from which 'the fist' also means 
the same. 'The fine flour together with the oil and the frankincense' represented all things of charity - 'fine flour' the spiritual ingredient of it, 'oil' the celestial, and 'frankincense' that which 
was in this manner pleasing. That 'fine flour' represents the spiritual ingredient is evident from what has just been stated and from what is stated below. That 'oil' represents the celestial ingredient, 
or the good or charity, see <a href="886.htm">886</a>, and that 'frankincense' on account of its odour represents that which is pleasing and acceptable, <a href="925.htm">925</a>. </p>
<p></p>
<p><b>[5]</b>
 Its being 'unleavened bread' or not fermented means 
that it was to be genuine, thus something offered from genuineness of heart and having no uncleanness. The eating of the rest by Aaron and his sons represented man's reciprocation and his making it 
his own, and thus represented conjunction by means of love and charity; and it is for this reason that they were commanded to eat it 'in a holy place'. Hence it is called something most holy. These were 
the things which were represented by the minchah. It was also the way in which the representatives themselves were perceived in heaven; and when the member of the Church understood them in the same 
way his ideas were like the perception which the angels possess, so that he was in the Lord's kingdom in heaven even though he was on earth. </p>
<p></p>
<p><b>[6]</b>
 For more about the minchah - what it was to consist 
of in any particular kind of sacrifice; the way in which it was to be baked into cakes; what kind was to be offered by those who were being cleansed, and also what kinds on other occasions (all of which 
would take too long to introduce and explain here) - see what is said about it in <a href="http://bible.gospelcom.net/cgi-bin/bible?passage=Exod%2029:%2039-41&amp;version=ESV&amp;interface=print&amp;showfn=yes&amp;showxref">Exod 29: 39-41</a>; <a href="http://bible.gospelcom.net/cgi-bin/bible?passage=Lev%205:%2011-13;%206:%2016,%2017,%2019-21;%2010:%2012,%2013;%2023:%2010-%2013,%206,%2017&amp;version=ESV&amp;interface=print&amp;showfn=yes&amp;showxref">Lev 5: 11-13; 6: 16, 17, 19-21; 10: 12, 13; 23: 10- 13, 6, 17</a>; <a href="http://bible.gospelcom.net/cgi-bin/bible?passage=Num%205:%2015&amp;version=ESV&amp;interface=print&amp;showfn=yes&amp;showxref">Num 5: 15</a> and following verses; 6: <a href="15.htm">15</a>-<a href="17.htm">17</a>, <a href="19.htm">19</a>, <a href="20.htm">20</a>; 7: in various places; 28: <a href="5.htm">5</a>, <a href="8.htm">8</a>, <a href="9.htm">9</a>, <a href="12.htm">12</a>, <a href="13.htm">13</a>, <a href="20.htm">20</a>, <a href="21.htm">21</a>, <a href="28.htm">28</a>, <a href="29.htm">29</a>; 29: <a href="3.htm">3</a>, <a href="4.htm">4</a>, <a href="9.htm">9</a>, <a href="10.htm">10</a>, <a href="14.htm">14</a>, <a href="15.htm">15</a>, <a href="18.htm">18</a>, <a href="21.htm">21</a>, <a href="24.htm">24</a>, <a href="27.htm">27</a>, <a href="30.htm">30</a>, <a href="33.htm">33</a>, <a href="37.htm">37</a> </p>

 'Fine flour made into cakes' had in general the same representation 
as bread, namely the celestial ingredient of love, while 'meals represented its spiritual ingredient, as becomes clear in the places indicated above. The loaves which were called 'the bread of the 
Presence' or 'the shewbread' consisted of fine flour, which was made into cakes and placed on the table to provide an unceasing representation of the Lord's love, that is, of His mercy, towards the whole 
human race, and man's reciprocation. These loaves are spoken of in Moses as follows, </p>
<blockquote>
You shall take fine pour and bake it into twelve cakes; two-tenths [of an ephah] shall there be in one cake 
And you shall place them in two rows, six in a row, on the clean table before Jehovah. And you shall put pure frankincense on each row, and it shall be bread serving as a memorial, a fire-offering to 
Jehovah. Every sabbath day [Aaron] shall set it out in order before Jehovah continually; it is from the children of Israel as an eternal covenant. And it shall be for Aaron and his sons, and they shall 
eat it in a holy place, for it is to him the most holy of fire-offerings to Jehovah, by an eternal statute. <a href="http://bible.gospelcom.net/cgi-bin/bible?passage=Lev%2024:%205-9&amp;version=ESV&amp;interface=print&amp;showfn=yes&amp;showxref">Lev 24: 5-9</a>. 
</blockquote>
<p>Every item and smallest detail mentioned here represented the holiness of 
love and charity, 'fine flour' having the same representation as meal of fine flour, namely that which is celestial and that which is spiritual that goes with it, and 'cake' the two when joined together. </p>
<p></p>
<p><b>[8]</b>
From this it is clear what the holiness of the Word is to those who possess heavenly ideas, and indeed what holiness was present within this particular representative observance, on account 
of which it is called 'most holy'. It is also clear how devoid of holiness the Word is to those who imagine that it does not have anything heavenly within it and who keep solely to externals. Exemplifying 
the latter are those who in the present verse under consideration perceive 'the meal' to be merely meal, 'the fine flour' merely fine flour, and 'the cake' merely a cake, and who imagine that 
these things have been stated without each one that is mentioned embodying something of the Divine within it. Their attitude is similar to that of those who imagine that the bread and wine of the Holy 
Supper are no more than a certain religious observance that does not have anything holy within it. Yet in fact it possesses such holiness that the minds of men are linked by means of it to the minds 
of those in heaven, when from an internal affection they think that the bread and wine mean the Lord's love and man's reciprocation, and by virtue of that interior thought and affection they abide in 
holiness. </p>
<p></p>
<p><b>[9]</b>
 Much the same was implied by the requirement that when the children of Israel entered the land they were to present as a heave-offering to Jehovah a cake made from the first of their 
dough, <a href="http://bible.gospelcom.net/cgi-bin/bible?passage=Num%2015:%2020&amp;version=ESV&amp;interface=print&amp;showfn=yes&amp;showxref">Num 15: 20</a>. The fact that such things are meant is also evident in the Prophets, from' among whom for the moment let this one place in Ezekiel be introduced here, </p>
<blockquote>
You were adorned with gold 
and silver, and your raiment was of fine linen and silk and embroidered cloth. You ate fine flour, honey, and oil. You became exceedingly beautiful, and attained to a kingdom. <a href="http://bible.gospelcom.net/cgi-bin/bible?passage=Ezek%2016:%2013&amp;version=ESV&amp;interface=print&amp;showfn=yes&amp;showxref">Ezek 16: 13</a>. 
</blockquote>
<p>This refers 
to Jerusalem, by which is meant the Church, which Church in its earliest days bore an appearance such as this, that is to say, the Ancient Church, which is described by means of raiment and many 
other adornments. Its affections for truth and good are also described by 'the fine flour, honey, and oil'. It may become clear to anyone that all these details mean in the internal sense something altogether 
different from what they do in the sense of the letter. And the same applies to Abraham's saying to Sarah, 'Take quickly three measures of meal of fine flour, knead it, and make cakes'. That 
'three' means things that are holy has been shown already in <a href="720.htm">720</a>, <a href="901.htm">901</a>. </p>

Quod `farina similaginis' sit spirituale et caeleste quo tunc apud Dominum, et quod `placentae' similiter cum utrumque conjunctum, constat manifeste ex sacrificiis Ecclesiae repraesentativae, et ex 
minha quae tunc adhibebatur, quae constabat ex similagine mixta oleo et facta in placentas; primarium cultus repraesentativi consistebat in holocaustis et sacrificiis, quae quid repraesentaverunt, dictum 
est supra, ubi de pane, n. 2165, nempe quod caelestia qui sunt regni Domini in caelis, et regni Domini in terris seu in Ecclesia tum quae regni Domini seu Ecclesiae apud unumquemvis, in genere omnia 
illa quae sunt amoris et charitatis, quia haec sunt caelestia, quae omnia tunc temporis vocabantur `panis,'; his sacrificiis adjungebatur etiam minha, quae, ut dictum, constabat ex similagine mixta 
oleo, cui quoque tus adjiciebatur, tum quoque libamen ex vino; [2] quid hae repraesentabant, etiam constare potest, nempe quod similia ac sacrificia, sed in minore gradu, ita quae sunt Ecclesiae spiritualis, 
tum quae sunt Ecclesiae externae; unicuique constare potest quod talia nusquam mandata fuissent nisi repraesentarent Divina, tum quod unumquodvis aliquid peculiare; nam nisi repraesentavissent 
Divina, non aliud fuissent quam similia quae apud gentiles, apud quos {1} quoque sacrificia, minhae, libamina, tura, tum quoque ignes perpetui, et plura quae a illos derivata fuerunt ab Ecclesia Antiqua, 
imprimis ab Hebraea; quibus quia separabantur interna, hoc est, Divina, quae repraesentabantur, nihil aliud fuerunt quam idololatrica; sicut etiam apud Judaeos facta sunt, quare etiam in omnia idololatriae 
genera lapsi sunt: inde manifestum cuivis esse potest quod arcana caelestia unicuivis ritui, imprimis sacrificiis et singulis eorum, inessent. [3] Quod minham attinet, describitur illa qualis 
esset et quomodo praepararetur in placentas, in toto capite apud Mosen, Lev. ii, ut et Num. xv, ac alibi.  Lex minhae his verbis describitur in Levitico, 	Ignis jugiter accensus erit super altari, 
non exstinguetur: et haec lex minhae; afferre illam filios Aharonis coram Jehovah ad facies altaris, et tollet ab illa pugillo suo de similagine minhae,: et de oleo ejus, et omne, tus quod super minha, 
et adolebit super altari; odor quietis, (o)in memoriale Jehovae; et residuum de illa comedent Aharon et filii ejus; azyma comedentur in loco sancto; in atrio 	tentorii conventus comedent eam; non 
coquetur fermentata; partem illorum dedi eam de ignitis Meis, sanctum sanctorum illa, vi 6-10, [A.V.13-17]; </p>
<p>[4] `ignis qui jugiter accensus erit super altari' repraesentabat amorem, hoc est, misericordiam 
Domini, perpetuam et aeternam; quod `ignis' significet amorem in Verbo, videatur n. 934; inde `ignita in odorem quietis' significant Domini beneplacitum in illis quae sunt amoris et charitatis; 
quod `odor' sit beneplacitum, hoc est, gratum, videatur n. 925, 1519; quod `acciperent pugillo' repraesentabat quod omnibus viribus seu omni anima amarent; `manus' enim seu `vola' significat potentiam, 
ut ostensum n. 878, inde etiam `pugillus'; `similago cum oleo et ture' repraesentaverunt omnia charitatis, `similago' spirituale ejus, `oleum' autem caeleste, `tus' quod ita gratum; quod `similago' 
spirituale, ex his et sequentibus patet; quod `oleum' caeleste seu bonum charitatis, videatur n. 886, quodque `tus' ab odore gratum et acceptum, n. 925; [5] quod `azymum' seu non fermentatum esset, significat 
quod sincerum, ita ex corde sincero et absque immundis; quod `residuum comederent Aharon et filii ejus' repraesentabat reciprocum hominis, et appropriationem, ita conjunctionem per amorem et 
charitatem, quare mandatum ut `comederent illud in loco sancto'; inde appellatur `sanctum sanctorum'; haec fuerant quae repraesentata sunt per `minham,' ac ipsa repraesentativa ita percepta fuerunt in 
caelo; cumque homo Ecclesiae ita capiebat illa, tunc fuit in idea simili perceptioni angelorum {2}, ita in ipso regno Domini in caelis, tametsi erat in terra.  [6] De minha porro agitur qualis esse debuit 
circa unumquodvis genus sacrificii, tum quomodo in placentas coqueretur, (o)ut et qualis offerretur ab illis qui mundabantur, etiam {3} in aliis occasionibus quae omnia adducere et explicare, (t)nimis 
prolixum foret, videantur quae de illa, Exod. xxix 39-41; Lev. v 11-13; vi 9, 10, 12-14 {4}; x 12, 13 xxiii 10-13, 16, 17; Num. v 15 seq.; vi 15-17, 19, 20; vii passim; xxviii 5 (x)8, 9, 12, 13, 
20, 21, 28, 29; xxix 3, 4, 9, 10, 14, 15, 18, 21, 24, 27, 30, 33, 37.  [7] `Similago facta in placentas' in genere idem repraesentabat ac panis, nempe caeleste amoris, et `farina' ejus spirituale, ut 
a locis supra citatis constare potest. Panes qui dicebantur `panis facierum' aut `panis propositionis' fiebant ex similagine, quae praeparabatur in placentas et ponebantur super mensa, in repraesentationem 
jugem amoris, hoc est, misericordiae Domini erga universum genus humanum et reciprocum hominis, de quibus ita apud Mosen, 	Sumes similaginem, et coques illam duodecim placentas duarum decimarum 
erit placenta una; et pones eas in duo: ordines, senas ordine, super mensa munda, coram Jehovah' et dabis super ordinem tus purum, et erit ad panem {5} in memoriale ignitum Jehovae, in die sabbati 
unoquoque ordinabit eum coram Jehovah jugiter, a cum filiis Israelis foedere aeternitatis; et erit Aharoni et illis ejus, et comedent eum in loco sancto, quia sanctitas sanctitatum [ille] illi, de ignitis 
Jehovae, statuto aeternitatis, Lev. xxiv 5-9; </p>
<p>singula {6} et singularissima repraesentabant sanctum amoris et charitatis et `similago' idem ac farina similaginis, nempe caeleste et ejus spirituale, 
ac `placenta' utrumque conjunctum; [8] inde constat {7} qualis sanctitas Verbi est illis qui in caelestibus ideis sunt; immo qualis sanctitas ipsi huic ritui repraesentativo inerat; inde est quod 
dicatur `sanctitas sanctitatum'; ac vicissim, qualis nulla sanctitas illis qui putant nihil caeleste illis inesse, ac in externis solum manent, ut qui hic {8} `farinam' percipiunt (t)ut mere farinam, 
`similaginem' ut similaginem, et `placentam' ut placentam, ac quod dicta ea fuissent absque quod singula aliquid Divini involverent; ii similiter faciunt ac qui putant {9} panem et vinum Sacrae Cenae 
non esse nisi quendam ritum, in quo non sanctum intus, cum tamen tale sanctum est ut mentes humanae per illam conjungantur mentibus caelestibus, cum cogitant ex affectione interna quod illa significent 
amorem Domini et reciprocum hominis, et ex interiore sic in sanctitate sunt: [9] simile involvebat quod filii Israelis cum venirent in terram, `de primitiis massarum darent placentam, sublationem Jehovae,' 
Num. xv 20; quod talia significentur, constare etiam potest apud Prophetas, e quibus pro tempore solum licet adducere quod apud Ezechielem, 	Ornata es auro et argento, et vestis tua byssus et 
sericum, et acupictum; similaginem, mel, et oleum comedisti, et pulchra facta es in valde valde, et prosperata es ad regnum, xvi 13, (m)ubi agitur de Hierosolyma, per quam significatur Ecclesia, quae 
tali ornatu fuit in suo primo tempore, nempe Ecclesia Antiqua, quae describitur per `vestes,' et plures ornatus; tum ejus affectiones veri et boni per `similaginem, mel et oleum'; unicuique constare 
potest quod omnia illa significent in sensu interno prorsus alia quam in sensu litterae; ita etiam haec quod Abrahamus dixerit ad Sarah, `festina tria sata farinae similaginis, pinse, et fac placentas'; 
quod `tria' significent sancta prius n. 720, 901 ostensum est.(n) 	@1 etiam.$ 	@2 cum angelis.$ 	@3 ut et.$ 	@4 [A V 1, 17, 19-21.]$ 	@5 panes I.$ 	@6 haec.$ 	@7 constare potest.$ 	@8 A is
