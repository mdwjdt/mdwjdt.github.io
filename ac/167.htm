<h3 align="center" class="ired">属天的奥秘 第167节</h3>
<h4 align="center"></h4><p><strong>167.</strong>人若了解每节经文隐藏着多少奥秘，他一定会感到吃惊。因为它所藏的奥秘之多，不可称述，极少在文字中透露出来。让我简单地说明一下。圣经的文字，在精灵界以优美的次序表现出来。因为精灵界是一个现象界，凡在其中生动呈现的现象，它所包含的所有信息都为第二层天的天使所觉知，第二层天天使所觉知的，又充分完整地以不可说的念头为第三层天的天使所觉知。照主所喜悦的，这可有无限的多样性。主的圣言即具有这样的性质。</p>

<p><strong>[NCE]167.</strong> If people realized how much was hidden in each verse, they would be dumbfounded. So much is hidden that it could never be told. This fact is scarcely visible in the letter.<br />To give some idea in a few words: In the world of spirits (since it is a representative world) the literal words, just as they are, are represented in a living way, arranged in beautiful display. Any live representation in that world is then perceived in all its finer detail by the angelic spirits in the second heaven. What the angelic spirits see is then perceived by the angels in the third heaven in great richness.{*1} These angels see the represented text filled with angelic ideas for which there are no words, and by the Lord's good pleasure, they see it in all its boundless variety. Such is the nature of the Lord's Word.<br /><br /><strong>Footnotes:</strong><br />{*1} Swedenborg says a little more about the three heavens in <a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_167/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_459" target=_top>459</a>, <a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_167/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_684" target=_top>684</a>, <a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_167/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_1642" target=_top>1642</a>. Early in Secrets of Heaven he refers to them as the heaven of good spirits, the heaven of angelic spirits, and the heaven of angels (as late as <a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_167/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_2026" target=_top>2026</a> he is referring to a heaven of angelic spirits as a separate thing from the heaven of angels), but later he tends simply to number them first, second, and third, and to describe the inhabitants of all of them, or at least of the second and third heavens, as angels. He devotes a chapter of his Heaven and Hell (<a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_167/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_29" target=_top>29-40</a>) to discussing this subject. The apostle Paul also speaks of a third heaven, in <a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_167/bible_king-james-version_2-corinthians_12_2" target=_top>2 Corinthians 12:2</a>.

If anyone could know how many arcana each particular verse contains, he would be amazed, for the number of arcana contained is past telling, and this is very little shown in the letter. To state the 
matter shortly: the words of the letter, exactly as they are, are vividly represented in the world of spirits, in a beautiful order. For the world of spirits is a world of representatives, and whatever 
is vividly represented there is perceived, in respect to the minute things contained in the representatives, by the angelic spirits who are in the second heaven; and the things thus perceived by the 
angelic spirits are perceived abundantly and fully in inexpressible angelic ideas by the angels who are in the third heaven, and this in boundless variety in accordance with the Lord's good pleasure. 
Such is the Word of the Lord. </p>

<p align="center"><b>Elliott(1983-1999) 167</b></p><p><b>167.</b>
But if anyone knew how many arcana each particular verse contains, he would be astounded. Each one contains so many arcana that they cannot possibly be numbered off. Yet this is barely evident at all 
from the letter. In short, the words of the letter, just as they are, are represented vividly in the world of spirits in wonderful array. For the world of spirits is a representative world, and whatever 
is represented vividly is perceived by angelic spirits in the second heaven even as to the minor details within those representatives. And the things perceived by angelic spirits in this way angels 
in the third heaven perceive abundantly and fully in inexpressible angelic ideas. In accordance with the Lord's Good Pleasure, they perceive them in complete and boundless variety. Such is the Word 
of the Lord.  </p>

</p><b>167.</b>
Sed si quis nosset quantum arcanorum continetur in unoquovis versiculo, obstupesceret; tantum arcanorum continetur ut nusquam edici possit; hoc minime elucet ex littera: ut breviter tradatur; sicut 
sunt verba litterae, repraesentantur ad vivum in mundo spirituum ordine pulchro, nam mundus spirituum est repraesentativus: et quicquid repraesentatur ad vivum, hoc percipitur in altero caelo a spiritibus 
angelicis quoad minutiora quae in repraesentatis: quae a spiritibus angelicis, haec in tertio caelo ab angelis copiose et plene ideis angelicis, inexpressibilibus, et quidem secundum Beneplacitum 
Domini, omni varietate, quae indefinita. Tale est Verbum Domini. </p>
