<h3 align="center" class="ired">属天的奥秘 第5929节</h3>
<h4 align="center"></h4><p><strong>5929.</strong>“他又亲吻众弟兄”表通过恩典联结。这从“亲吻”的含义清楚可知，“亲吻”是指通过情感结合（参看<a href="3573.htm">3573</a>，<a href="3574.htm">3574</a>，<a href="4353.htm">4353</a>节），在此是指通过恩典联结，因为雅各的儿子们所代表的属世层中的教会真理离内在良善，即约瑟更远。更远的真理虽通过居间层与内在良善联结，但有很长时间它们会保持诸如与内在良善不一致的特征。这就是为何“亲吻众弟兄”表示通过恩典联结。<br />之所以说“通过恩典”，而不是说“通过怜悯”，是因为更远且不完全一致的真理并不具备使得人们祈求怜悯的那种谦卑。事实上，他们甚至不能发自内心提及怜悯这个词，只提恩典一词。这是因为依附于这些真理的不一致的特征是由爱自己产生的，只爱自己的人绝无可能发自内心让自己谦卑下来。相反，他自高自大，因为他在一切事上只关心他自己，很少关心自己以外的任何事。</p>

<p align="center"><b>Potts(1905-1910) 5929</b></p><p><b>5929.</b>
And he kissed all his brethren. That this signifies adjunction from grace, is evident from the signification of "to kiss," as being conjunction from affection (see n. 3573, 3574, 4353), here adjunction 
from grace, because the truths of the church in the natural, which are represented by the sons of Jacob, are more remote from internal good, which is Joseph; and things more remote are indeed conjoined 
through the intermediate with internal good, but yet long retain such things as do not correspond with internal good; and therefore by "kissing his brethren" is signified adjunction from grace. It 
is said from grace, not from mercy, because things more remote and not fully correspondent are not in such humiliation that they can implore mercy; from the heart they cannot even mention mercy, but 
instead thereof grace; and this because the non-correspondent things which adhere are from the love of self, and he who loves himself cannot possibly humble himself from the heart; for he sets himself 
up, because he regards himself in everything, and makes small account of what is outside of himself. </p>

<p align="center"><b>Elliott(1983-1999) 5929</b></p><p><b>5929.</b>
'And he kissed all his brothers' means a linking together through grace. This is clear from the meaning of 'kissing' as a joining together through affection, dealt with in <a href="3573.htm">3573</a>, <a href="3574.htm">3574</a>, <a href="4753.htm">4753</a>, in this case 
a linking together through grace because the truths of the Church within the natural, represented by 'the sons of Jacob', are more remote from internal good, which is 'Joseph'. And although truths 
that are more remote are, it is true, joined through the intermediary to internal good, yet for a long time they retain features such as are not in agreement with internal good. This is why 'kissing 
his brothers' means a linking together through grace. </p>
<p></p>
<p><b>[2]</b>
 The expression 'through grace' is used, and not 'through mercy', because truths that are more remote and not in full agreement are not equipped 
with the kind of humility that enables people to plead for mercy. Indeed they are unable in their hearts even to use the word mercy, only the word grace. The reason for this is that the discordant 
features that cling to those truths arise from self-love, and one who loves only himself cannot at heart possibly humble himself. Rather, he exalts himself, for in every single thing he regards only 
himself and has little concern for anything outside himself. </p>

`Et osculatus omnes fratres suos': quod significet adjunctionem ex gratia, constat ex significatione `osculari' quod sit conjunctio ex affectione, de qua n. 3573, 3574, {1} 4353, hic adjunctio ex gratia, 
quia vera Ecclesiae in naturali quae repraesentantur per `filios Jacobi', a bono interno quod `Joseph', remotiora sunt, et quae remotiora sunt, quidem conjunguntur per medium cum bono interno, sed 
usque diu retinent talia quae cum bono interno {2}non correspondent; idcirco per `osculari fratres' significatur adjunctio ex gratia. [2] Ex gratia dicitur, non ex misericordia, quia quae remotiora 
sunt et non plene correspondentia, non in tali humiliatione sunt ut implorare queant misericordiam, immo ne quidem ex corde nominare misericordiam, sed loco ejus gratiam; et hoc quia non correspondentia 
quae adhaerent, sunt ex amore sui, et qui se amat, nusquam se humiliare potest ex corde, erigit enim se, {3}nam spectat se in singulis, (c)et parvi facit illa quae extra se. @1 i 3800$ @2 before
