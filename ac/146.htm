<h3 align="center" class="ired">属天的奥秘 第146节</h3>
<h4 align="center"></h4><p><strong>146.</strong>综合前面的解释，经文的象征义就连贯起来了。十八节说，“那人独居不好，我要为他建一个看似属于他的帮手”，然后提到“牲畜”和“飞鸟”，这些在前面已经提过，之后又重复说，那人没有遇见“一个看似属于他的帮手”。<br />总的意思是，他虽然了解自己在良善之情和真理之知上的本质，却依然渴望自我。当人渴望自我，就会轻看主的恩赐，无论这些恩赐是如何清楚地向他显明出来。</p>

<p><strong>[NCE]146.</strong> From all these explanations you can see how the symbolism interconnects. Verse <a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_146/bible_king-james-version_genesis_2_18" target=_top>18</a>. said, "It is not good for the human to be alone. Let me make him an aid that seems to be his." Next come the animals and birds, which also appeared earlier, and then immediately the same words recur, "For the human no aid was found that seemed to be his." That is, when humans received the ability to recognize their own nature — the nature of their good emotions and true concepts — they still sought independence. After all, when people are such that they want to rule themselves, they begin to despise all that the Lord has to offer them, no matter how clearly those things are presented and illustrated for them. </p>
<p align="center"><b>Potts(1905-1910) 146</b></p><p><b>146.</b>
From what has been stated, the connection of what is signified may be seen. In verse 18 it is said, "It is not good that the man should be alone, I will make him a help as with him" and presently "beasts" 
and "birds" are spoken of, which nevertheless had been treated of before, and immediately it is repeated that "for the man there was not found a help as with him" which denotes that although he 
was permitted to know his quality as to the affections of good, and knowledges of truth, still he inclined to his Own; for those who are such as to desire what is their own, begin to despise the things 
of the Lord, however plainly they may be represented and shown to them. </p>

<p align="center"><b>Elliott(1983-1999) 146</b></p><p><b>146.</b>
These considerations make plain the connection between the things that are meant. Verse 18 said that 'it is not good that the man should be alone, I will make for him a help suitable for him', and directly 
after that beasts and birds are mentioned even though they have been dealt with already. Immediately after this the statement is repeated that 'for man there was not found a help suitable for him', 
meaning that when he had been made aware of what he was in character as regards affections for good and cognitions of truth he still had his heart set on the proprium. In fact, people such as desire 
the proprium begin to despise those things that are the Lord's, no matter how well they are represented and shown to them.  </p>

<p align="center"><b>Latin(1748-1756) 146</b>
</p><b>146.</b>
Ex his conspici potest nexus rerum quae significantur: versu {x}18 dictum quod 'non bonum ut sit homo solus is, faciam ei auxilium tanquam apud illum'; et mox agitur de bestiis et avibus, de quibus 
tamen prius, et sequitur immediate idem, quod 'homini non invenit auxilium tanquam apud illum'; quod nempe cum ei cognoscere datum qualis esset quoad affectiones boni et cognitiones veri, quod usque affectaret 
proprium: qui enim tales sunt ut cupiant proprium, incipiunt contemnere illa quae sunt Domini, utcumque illa ei repraesentantur et demonstrantur. </p>
