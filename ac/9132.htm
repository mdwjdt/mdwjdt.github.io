<h3 align="center" class="ired">属天的奥秘 第9132节</h3>
<h4 align="center"></h4><p><strong>9132.</strong>“就要被卖，顶他所偷来的”表疏远。这从“被卖”和“顶所偷来的”的含义清楚可知：“被卖”是指疏远（参看<a href="4752.htm">4752</a>，<a href="4758.htm">4758</a>，<a href="5886.htm">5886</a>节），在此是指对已经被夺走，并且荡然无存的良善或真理的疏远（<a href="9131.htm">9131</a>节）；“顶所偷来的”是指用代替被夺走之物的其它某种良善或真理作出修正和恢复，这由“赔偿”来表示（<a href="9130.htm">9130</a>节）。因为所偷来的东西被卖，是为了赔偿所偷来的东西。这节经文的意思是：一个人若能看见与他同在的良善或真理正在被邪恶所产生的虚假夺走，就犯下了对它们施暴的罪，因为他完全清楚自己在做什么。事实上，当一个人清楚知道他在做什么时，他的行为便源于他的意愿，同时也源于他的理解力，从而源于他的整个人，因为人之为人，凭的是心智的这两种官能。源于这二者的行为源于邪恶所生的虚假：源于虚假，是因为它源于理解力；源于邪恶，是因为它源于意愿。这就是使得此人有罪的原因。凡来自人的理解力，同时来自他意愿的东西都会变成他自己（参看<a href="9009.htm">9009</a>，<a href="9069.htm">9069</a>，<a href="9071.htm">9071</a>节）；一个人若看见自己意愿里面的邪恶，却不用自己的理解力来约束它，就有罪了（参看<a href="9075.htm">9075</a>节）。</p>

<p align="center"><b>Potts(1905-1910) 9132</b></p><p><b>9132.</b>
He shall be sold for his theft. That this signifies alienation, is evident from the signification of "to be sold," as being alienation (see n. 4752, 4758, 5886), here of the good and truth taken away, 
of which nothing remains (n. 9131); and from the signification of "for the theft," as being amendment and restoration by other good or truth in place of that taken away, which is signified by "repaying" 
(n. 9130); for the thief was sold that the theft might be repaid. With what is contained in this verse the case is this. He who sees that the good or truth with him is being taken away by falsity 
derived from evil, is guilty of the violence done to them, for it is done with his knowledge. For that which is done with the man's knowledge, proceeds from the will, and at the same time from the understanding, 
thus from the whole man, because man is man from these two, and what is done from these two is done from the falsity which is from evil - from falsity, because from the understanding; and 
from evil, because from the will. It is from this that the man is guilty. That which comes from a man's understanding, and at the same time from his will, is made his own (see n. 9009, 9069, 9071); and 
that a man becomes guilty if when he sees the evil of his will he does not repress it by means of his understanding, see n. 9075. </p>

<p align="center"><b>Elliott(1983-1999) 9132</b></p><p><b>9132.</b>
'He shall be sold for his theft' means alienation. This is clear from the meaning of 'being sold' as alienation, dealt with in <a href="4752.htm">4752</a>, <a href="4758.htm">4758</a>, <a href="5886.htm">5886</a>, at this point the alienation of the good or truth that 
has been taken away, and of which nothing remains, <a href="9131.htm">9131</a>; and from the meaning of 'for his theft' as making amends and undertaking restoration with some other good or truth in place of that which has 
been taken away, meant by 'making repayment', <a href="9130.htm">9130</a>. For the thief was sold in order that repayment might be made for the theft.  </p>
<p>What this verse implies is that when a person can see that good or truth 
with him is being taken away by falsity arising from evil he is guilty of the violence done to them, since he knows full well what he is doing. For when a person knows full well what he is doing 
his deeds spring from his will and at the same time from his understanding, and so from his entire person since a person is a person by virtue of both those powers of mind. And a deed springing from both 
springs from falsity that arises out of evil - from falsity because it springs from the understanding, and from evil because it springs from the will. This is what makes the person guilty.  </p>
<p>A person 
makes that his own which comes from his understanding and at the same time from his will, see <a href="9009.htm">9009</a>, <a href="9069.htm">9069</a>, <a href="9071.htm">9071</a>.  A person becomes guilty if he does not use his power of understanding to restrain 
evil in his will when he sees it, <a href="9075.htm">9075</a>.  </p>

</p><b>9132.</b>
`Vendetur pro furto suo': quod significet abalienationem, constat ex significatione `vendi' quod sit abalienatio, de qua n. 4752, 4758, 5886, hic boni et veri ablati, de quo nihil superest, (o)n. (x)9131, 
et ex significatione `pro furto' quod sit emendatio et restitutio per aliud bonum aut verum loco ablati, quae per `rependere' significatur, n. (x)9130; vendebatur enim fur ut rependeretur furtum. 
 Cum illis quae in hoc versu, ita se habet: qui videt quod bonum aut verum quod apud se est {1}, per falsum ex malo auferatur {2}, is reus est violentiae illis illatae, nam id fit conscio illo; quod 
(d)enim fit ex conscio, id ex voluntate et simul ex intellectu exit, ita ex toto homine, nam homo est homo ex utroque; et quod fit ex utroque, id fit ex falso quod ex malo, ex falso quia ex intellectu, 
et ex malo quia ex voluntate; inde homini reatus; quod id homini approprietur quod ex intellectu ejus et simul ex voluntate ejus venit, videatur n. 9009, 9069, 9071, et quod reus fiat homo si non 
per intellectuale reprimit malum voluntarii cum videt illud, n. 9075. @1 quae apud se sunt$ @2 auferantur$ </p>
