<h3 align="center" class="ired">属天的奥秘 第6312节</h3>
<h4 align="center"></h4><p><strong>6312.</strong>由于地狱靠这种劣质的感官之光看见，所以人若不从这光中被提升上来，必然灭亡；他通过信之良善被提升上来。也有些地狱居于更诡诈的气场，那些心肠歹毒，千方百计剥夺他人财物，并谋划各种诡计，好掌控他们的人就住在那里。但我发现，这个气场流入外在感官气场；而外在感官气场来自人的无意识能力所在的背部。这就是为何感官气场如此强而有力。</p>

<p align="center"><b>Potts(1905-1910) 6312</b></p><p><b>6312.</b>
As the hells are in this sensuous light, therefore unless a man is elevated out of it, he must needs perish. He is elevated by means of the good of faith. There are also hells which are in a more subtle 
sphere, where are they who have been inwardly malignant, and have devised many arts for depriving others of their goods, and have contrived many treacherous plans in order to obtain dominion. But 
it was observed that this sphere flows into the external sensuous sphere, and this at the back where are the involuntary things of man. Hence the sensuous sphere is so strong. </p>

<p align="center"><b>Elliott(1983-1999) 6312</b></p><p><b>6312.</b>
Because hell sees by this inferior light, a person inevitably perishes if he is not raised up above it; and he is raised up by means of the good of faith. There are also hells which inhabit a sphere 
involving greater craftiness; their inhabitants are those who have been malevolent inwardly and have worked out many artful ways of depriving other people of their goods, and have devised many kinds of 
tricks so that they could have control over them. But I have noticed that this sphere flows into the external sensory sphere; it comes from those parts in a person's back where his involuntary powers 
are located. This is why a sensory sphere is so powerful. </p>

</p><b>6312.</b>
Quia in sensuali hoc lumine inferna sunt, {1}ideo nisi homo ab illo elevatur, non potest non perire; elevatur per bonum fidei.  Sunt etiam inferna quae in subtiliore sphaera sunt, in {2}illis sunt qui 
maligni fuerunt intus, et plures artes excogitaverunt deprivandi alios suis bonis, ac plures dolos emachinati {3}sunt ut imperarent; sed observatum est quod haec sphaera influat in sphaeram sensualem 
externam, et quidem a parte tergali ubi involuntaria hominis; inde sensualis sphaera tam valida est. @1 quare$ @2 quibus$ @3 imperandi aliis$ </p>
