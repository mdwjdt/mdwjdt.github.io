<h3 align="center" class="ired">属天的奥秘 第7854节</h3>
<h4 align="center"></h4><p><strong>7854.</strong>“和苦菜”表通过试探中的不愉快的经历。这从“苦菜”或苦味的含义清楚可知，“苦菜”或苦味是指令人不快的东西，在此是指试探中的经历。因为“逾越节的羔羊”所代表的纯真之良善若不通过试探，就无法被任何人吸收。“无酵饼”表示这种良善；并且由于这种良善通过试探被吸收，所以经上要求饼要与苦菜同吃。此外，对他们来说，这饼和吗哪一样，是苦炼的饼（申命记<a href="http://39-27.cn/申8.15.htm">8:15</a>，<a href="http://39-27.cn/申8.16.htm">16</a>；<a href="http://39-27.cn/申16.3.htm">16:3</a>），因为它没有酵母，也就是说，没有任何由邪恶所生的虚假；因为没有人能承受纯粹的真理或纯粹的良善。“苦”表示令人不快的东西，这明显可见于以赛亚书：<br />祸哉！那些称恶为善、称善为恶；以苦为甜、以甜为苦的人！（以赛亚书<a href="http://39-27.cn/赛5.20.htm">5:20</a>）<br />同一先知书：<br />他们不得又喝酒又唱歌；喝烈酒的，必以之为苦。（以赛亚书<a href="http://39-27.cn/赛24.9.htm">24:9</a>）<br />“苦”表示试探中的不愉快的经历，这从以下出埃及记中的话明显看出来：<br />最后他们到了玛拉，因苦不能喝水，因为它们发苦。百姓就向摩西发怨言，摩西呼求耶和华，耶和华指示他一块木头，他把木头扔进水里，水就变甜了。耶和华在那里为他们定了律例、典章，在那里试验他。（出埃及记<a href="http://39-27.cn/出15.23.htm">15:23</a>-<a href="http://39-27.cn/出15.25.htm">25</a>）<br />启示录：<br />就有烧着的大星好像火把从天上落下来。这星名叫苦艾，因水变苦，就因水死了许多人。（启示录<a href="http://39-27.cn/启8.10.htm">8:10</a>-<a href="http://39-27.cn/启8.11.htm">11</a>）<br />在这些经文中，“苦水”表示试探中的不愉快的经历。因水而死的的人表示那些在试探中屈服的人。</p>

Upon things bitter. That this signifies by means of the undelightful things of temptations, is evident from the signification of "bitter things" or "bitternesses" as being things undelightful, here those 
which belong to temptations. For the good of innocence, which is represented by the paschal lamb, cannot be appropriated to anyone except through temptations. By "unleavened bread" such good is signified, 
and because this is appropriated through temptations, the bread was ordered to be eaten upon bitter things; and moreover, that bread was to them bread of affliction, like the manna (Deut. 8:15, 
16; 16:3), because it was devoid of leaven, that is, of any falsity from evil, for man cannot endure pure truth and pure good. That things undelightful are signified by "bitter things," is plain in 
Isaiah: </p>
<p>      Woe to them that call evil good, and good evil; that put bitter for sweet, and sweet for bitter! (Isa. 5:20).      They shall not drink wine with a song; strong drink shall be bitter 
to them that drink it (Isa. 24:9). That the undelightful things of temptations are signified by "bitter things" is evident from these words in Exodus: </p>
<p>     At last they came unto Marah, but they could 
not drink of the waters, on account of their bitterness, because they were bitter. And the people murmured against Moses, who, when he cried unto Jehovah, Jehovah showed him wood which he cast into 
the waters, and the waters were made sweet. There He set for him a statute and a judgment, because there He tried him (Exod. 15:23-25). And also in John: </p>
<p>     There fell from heaven a great star, 
burning as a torch. The name of the star is called Wormwood, and many men died of the waters, because they were made bitter (Rev. 8:10-11). In these passages "bitter waters" denote the undelightful things 
of temptations; the "men who died of the waters" denote those who succumbed in temptations. </p>

'On bitter herbs' means through the unpleasant experiences of temptation. This is clear from the meaning of 'bitter herbs', or bitterness, as what is undelightful, in this case the experiences of temptation. 
For the good of innocence, represented by 'the Passover lamb', cannot be assimilated by anyone except through temptations - 'Unleavened bread' means this kind of good; and since it is assimilated 
through temptations people were required to eat it 'on bitter herbs'. What was more, that bread was for them, like the manna, 'the bread of affliction', <a href="http://bible.gospelcom.net/cgi-bin/bible?passage=Deut%208:15,%2016;%2016:3&amp;version=ESV&amp;interface=print&amp;showfn=yes&amp;showxref">Deut 8:15, 16; 16:3</a>, because it was without 
yeast, that is, any falsity arising from evil; for no one can bear pure truth or pure good. The use of 'bitter' to mean what is unpleasant is evident in Isaiah, </p>
<blockquote>
Woe to those who speak of evil as 
good, and of good as evil, who put bitter for sweet, and sweet for bitter! <a href="http://bible.gospelcom.net/cgi-bin/bible?passage=Isa%205:20&amp;version=ESV&amp;interface=print&amp;showfn=yes&amp;showxref">Isa 5:20</a>. 
</blockquote>
<p>And in the same prophet, </p>
<blockquote>
They will not drink wine with singing, strong drink will be bitter to those drinking 
it. <a href="http://bible.gospelcom.net/cgi-bin/bible?passage=Isa%2024:9&amp;version=ESV&amp;interface=print&amp;showfn=yes&amp;showxref">Isa 24:9</a>. 
</blockquote>
<p>The use of 'bitter' to mean the unpleasant experiences of temptation is evident from the following words: In Exodus, </p>
<blockquote>
At length they came to Marah,<A name="fntext1"></a><A href="#fn1"><sup>a</sup></a> but they could not drink the 
waters for bitterness; for they were bitter. The people therefore grumbled against Moses; and when he cried to Jehovah, Jehovah showed him [some] wood, which he threw into the waters, and the waters 
were made sweet. There He established for him a statute and a judgement, that He tempted him there. <a href="http://bible.gospelcom.net/cgi-bin/bible?passage=Exod%2015:23-25&amp;version=ESV&amp;interface=print&amp;showfn=yes&amp;showxref">Exod 15:23-25</a>. 
</blockquote>
<p>And also in John, </p>
<blockquote>
A great star fell from heaven, burning like a torch. The name 
of the star is called Wormwood; and many people died from the waters, because they were made bitter. <a href="http://bible.gospelcom.net/cgi-bin/bible?passage=Rev%208:10,%2011&amp;version=ESV&amp;interface=print&amp;showfn=yes&amp;showxref">Rev 8:10, 11</a>. 
</blockquote>
<p>'Bitter waters' here stands for the unpleasant experiences of temptation. People 
died from the waters' stands for those who gave way in temptations.

`Super amaroribus': quod significet per tentationum injucunda, constat ex significatione `amarorum' seu `amaritudinum' quod sint injucunda, hic quae tentationum; bonum enim innocentiae, quod per `agnum 
paschalem' repraesentatur, non alicui appropriari potest nisi {1}per tentationes; per `azymum panem' {2} tale bonum significatur, quod quia appropriatur per tentationes, statutum est ut `comederent 
illum super amaroribus'; et praeterea panis ille erat illis panis afflictionis, sicut manna, Deut. viii 15, 16, xvi 3, {3} quia erat absque fermento, hoc est, absque aliquo falso ex malo, nam homo purum 
verum et purum bonum non sustinet.  Quod injucunda significentur per `amara,' patet apud Esaiam, Vae dicentibus de malo bonum, et de bono malum, ponentibus amarum in dulce, et dulce in amarum! v 
(x)20: </p>
<p>et apud eundem, Cum cantu non bibent vinum, amara erit sicera bibentibus illam, xxiv 9. Quod injucunda tentationum significentur per `amara,' patet ex his: in Exodo, Tandem venerunt ad Marah, 
sed non potuerunt bibere aquas prae amaritudine, quia amarae illae; murmuravit itaque populus contra Moschen, qui cum clamaret ad Jehovam, monstravit illi Jehovah lignum, quod projecit in aquas, et 
dulces factae sunt aquae; ibi posuit illi statutum et judicium, quod ibi tentaverit illum, (x)xv 23-25: </p>
<p>et quoque apud Johannem, Cecidit de caelo stella magna ardens sicut lampas, nomen stellae dicitur 
absinthium, multique homines mortui sunt ex aquis, quia amarae factae sunt, Apoc. viii 10, 11; </p>
<p>`aquae amarae' hic pro injucundis tentationum; `homines mortui ex aquis' pro illis qui in tentationibus 
succubuerunt. 	@1 subeat$ 	@2 i etiam$ 	@3 i ex causa$ </p>
