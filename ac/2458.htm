<h3 align="center" class="ired">属天的奥秘 第2458节</h3>
<h4 align="center"></h4><p><strong>2458．创世记19:30.</strong> 罗得因为怕住在琐珥，就同他两个女儿，从琐珥上去住在山里；他和他两个女儿住在一个洞里。<br />“罗得从琐珥上去”表当他们不再具有对真理的情感后。“住在山里”表那时他们将自己转到一种良善那里。“就同他两个女儿”表源于那良善的情感也是这样。“因为怕住在琐珥”表因为他们不能再出于对真理的情感关注良善。“住在一个洞里”表虚假的良善。“和他两个女儿”表源于这<br />良善的情感，就是对这种良善和这种虚假的情感。</p>

Verse 30. And Lot went up out of Zoar, and dwelt in the mountain, and his two daughters with him; for he feared to dwell in Zoar; and he dwelt in a cave, he and his two daughters. "Lot went up out of 
Zoar," signifies when they were no longer in the affection of truth; "and dwelt in the mountain," signifies that they then betook themselves to a kind of good; " and his two daughters with him," signifies 
that so did the affections thence derived; "for he feared to dwell in Zoar," signifies because they could no longer look to good from the affection of truth; "and he dwelt in a cave," signifies 
the good of falsity; "and his two daughters," signifies the affections thence derived, which are those of such good and such falsity. </p>

Verse 30 And Lot went up out of Zoar and dwelt in the mountain, and his two daughters with him, for he was afraid to dwell in Zoar. And he dwelt in a cave - he, and his two daughters. </p>
<p>'Lot went up 
out of Zoar' means when the affection for truth existed with them no longer. 'And dwelt in the mountain' means that in that case they transferred themselves to a kind of good. 'And his two daughters 
with him' means as did affections deriving from that good. 'For he was afraid to dwell in Zoar' means because they were unable any more to look to good from the affection for truth. 'And he dwelt in a 
cave - he' means good enveloped in falsity. 'And his two daughters' means affections deriving from that good - affections for that kind of good and for that kind of falsity. </p>

Vers. 30.  Et ascendit Lot e Zoar, et habitavit in monte, et duae filiae ejus cum eo, quia timuit habitare in Zoar: et habitabat in spelunca is, et duae filiae ejus. `Ascendit Lot e Zoar' significat 
cum non amplius in affectione veri essent: `et habitavit in monte' significat quod tunc ad quoddam bonum se conferrent: `et duae filiae ejus cum eo' significant quod affectiones inde similiter: `quia 
timuit habitare in Zoar' significat quia ex affectione veri non amplius spectare bonum possent: `et habitabat in spelunca is' significat bonum falsi: `et duae filiae ejus' significat affectiones inde, 
quae sunt talis boni et talis falsi. </p>
