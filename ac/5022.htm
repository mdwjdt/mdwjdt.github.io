<h3 align="center" class="ired">属天的奥秘 第5022节</h3>
<h4 align="center"></h4><p><strong>5022.</strong>“妇人把约瑟的衣裳放在自己那里”表它保留了最外层的真理。这从“放在她那里”和“衣裳”的含义清楚可知：“放在她那里”是指保留；“衣裳”是指最外层的真理，如前所述（<a href="5006.htm">5006</a>，<a href="5008.htm">5008</a>节），因这真理被夺走了，所以属灵人不再有任何用来保护自己免受那些纯属世之人伤害的事物了（<a href="5008.htm">5008</a>e，<a href="5009.htm">5009</a>节）；在这次事件中，他受到了伤害。因为在这种情况下，凡属灵人所说的话，纯属世人都说他们没有觉察到，并且这话不是真的。一提及任何内在或属灵之物，他们要么嘲笑它，要么称其为奥秘；结果，他们之间的一切结合都被切断了；当这种结合被切断时，属灵人就会在纯属世人当中经历艰难。这一点由以下事实来代表：妻子用这件衣裳来向她的丈夫证明她所做的指控后，约瑟就被下在监里。</p>

<p align="center"><b>Potts(1905-1910) 5022</b></p><p><b>5022.</b>
And she laid up his garment by her. That this signifies that it retained ultimate truth, is evident from the signification of "laying up by her," as being to retain; and from the signification of a "garment," 
as being ultimate truth (of which above, n. 5006, 5008), which truth being taken away, the spiritual man has no longer anything with which to defend himself against those who are merely natural 
(n. 5008e, 5009), and in this event injury is done to him; for whatever the spiritual man then speaks, merely natural men say that they do not perceive, and also that it is not so. And if what is 
internal or spiritual is but mentioned, they either ridicule it or call it mystical; wherefore all conjunction between them is then broken, and when this is broken, the spiritual man suffers hard things 
among the merely natural, which is represented by Joseph's being cast into prison, after the wife had testified by the garment in the presence of her husband. </p>

<p align="center"><b>Elliott(1983-1999) 5022</b></p><p><b>5022.</b>
'And she kept his garment with her' means that it retained outermost truth. This is clear from the meaning of 'keeping with oneself' as retaining, and from the meaning of 'a garment' as outermost truth, 
dealt with above, in <a href="5006.htm">5006</a>, <a href="5008.htm">5008</a>; for once that truth is removed the spiritual man no longer has anything with which he may protect himself against people who are merely natural, <a href="5008.htm">5008</a> (end), <a href="5009.htm">5009</a>, 
and so he suffers harm. For any utterance made in this case by the spiritual man is declared by those who are merely natural to be something they do not perceive and also something that is not true. At 
the mere mention of anything internal or spiritual they either ridicule it or else call it something arcane, as a result of which any link they may have with the spiritual man is severed. And once that 
link has been severed the spiritual man undergoes trying experiences at the hands of those who are merely natural. This is also represented by the fact that after the wife used the garment to prove 
to her husband the accusation she was making, Joseph was thrown into the prison-house.  </p>

`Et reposuit vestem ejus apud se': quod significet quod retinuerit ultimum verum, constat ex significatione `reponere apud se' quod sit retinere; et a significatione `vestis' quod sit ultimum verum, 
de qua supra n. 5006, 5008, quo vero abstracto spiritualis homo non amplius quid habet quo se defendat contra mere naturales, n. (o)5008 fin., 5009, et tunc injuria ei fit; quicquid enim tunc loquitur 
spiritualis homo, dicunt mere naturales quod non percipiant et quoque quod non ita sit; et si modo nominatur internum vel spirituale, vel subsannant vel mysticum vocant; </p>
<p>quapropter tunc inter 
illos omnis conjunctio rupta est; qua rupta spiritualis homo dura patitur {1} apud mere naturales, quod etiam repraesentatur per id quod Josephus {2} postquam uxor testificata per vestem coram marito, 
in domum carceris conjectus sit. @1 spirituales dura patiuntur$ @2 Josephum quod$ </p>
