<h3 align="center" class="ired">属天的奥秘 第1837节</h3>
<h4 align="center"></h4><p><strong>1837.</strong>“日落的时候”表即将终结之前的那段时期和状态。这从“日”的含义清楚可知。就内义而言，“日”表主，并由此表爱与仁的属天之物，因而表爱与仁本身（如前所述，<a href="30.htm">30</a>-<a href="38.htm">38</a>，<a href="1053.htm">1053</a>节）。由此明显可知，“日落”表教会的末了，也就是所谓的终结，这时，教会不再有任何仁爱。主的教会还好比一天当中的各个时辰：它的初期好比日出，或黎明和早晨；它的末了好比日落，或傍晚和那时所笼罩的阴影，因为这二者之间有相似性。教会又好比一年四季：它的初期好比春天，这时万物盛开；而临近终结的时期则好比秋天，这时，万物开始枯萎。它甚至好比金属：它的初期被称作精金；它的末了被称作铁和泥，如但以理书所言（2:31-33）。由此明显可知“日落的时候”是什么意思，也就是说，它表示即将终结之前的时期和状态，因为太阳还没有落下。下文则论述了日落后教会的状态，因为那时天黑压压，还有从那些肉块中经过的冒烟的炉和烧着的火把。</p>

<p><strong>[NCE]1837.</strong> The symbolism of the sun was about to set as the period preceding the end, and conditions then, can be seen from the symbolism of the sun. On an inner level the sun symbolizes the Lord and therefore the heavenly qualities of love and charity, so it symbolizes love and charity itself, as discussed before at <a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_1837/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_30" target=_top>30-38</a>, <a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_1837/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_1053" target=_top>1053</a>. This shows that sunset is the church's final era, which is called the consummation, or end, when charity dies out.<br />The Lord's church is compared to times of day, because of resemblances between the two. Its early period is compared to sunrise, or dawn, and to morning. Its final period is compared to sunset, or evening, and to the shadows then. The church is also compared to the yearly seasons. Its early days are compared to spring, when everything blooms. As it nears its end it is compared to fall, when things start to fade. The church is even compared to metals. Its early days are called golden, its last days, iron and clay, as in <a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_1837/bible_king-james-version_daniel_2_31" target=_top>Daniel 2:31</a>, <a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_1837/bible_king-james-version_daniel_2_32" target=_top>32</a>, <a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_1837/bible_king-james-version_daniel_2_33" target=_top>33</a>. This clarifies what the sun was about to set symbolizes; it symbolizes the period preceding the end and conditions then, since it had not yet set. Later sections deal with conditions in the church after sunset, when darkness fell and the smoke of a furnace and a torch of fire passed between the pieces [<a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_1837/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_1858" target=_top>1858-1862</a>]. </p>

The sun was going down. That this signifies the time and the state before the consummation, is evident from the signification of "the sun." In the internal sense "the sun" signifies the Lord, and thence 
it signifies the celestial things which are of love and charity, consequently love itself and charity (spoken of above, n. 30-38, and n. 1053). From this it is evident that the "going down of the 
sun" denotes the last time of the church, which is called the consummation, when there is no longer any charity. The Lord's church is also compared to the times of the day; its first period to the rising 
of the sun, or to the dawn and the morning; its last to the setting of the sun, or to the evening and the shades then prevailing, for the two things are similarly circumstanced. The church is also 
compared to the times of the year; its first period to the spring, when all things are in bloom; that which is before the last to the autumn, when they begin to become inactive. It is even compared to 
the metals; its first period is called golden; its last, iron and clay; as in Daniel (2:31-33). From all this it is evident what is signified by "the going down of the sun," namely, that it signifies 
the time and the state before the consummation, seeing that the sun had not yet set. In what follows, the state of the church when the sun has set is treated of, in that there was then thick darkness 
and the smoke of a furnace, and that a torch of fire passed between the pieces. </p>

<p align="center"><b>Elliott(1983-1999) 1837</b></p><p><b>1837.</b>
That 'as the sun was going down' means the period of time and the state just before the close is clear from the meaning of 'the sun'. In the internal sense 'the sun' means the Lord, and because of this 
means the celestial things of love and charity, consequently love and charity themselves, dealt with already in <a href="30.htm">30</a>-<a href="38.htm">38</a>, and <a href="1053.htm">1053</a>. From this it is evident that 'the going down of the sun' is the last 
period of time in the Church, which is called the close, when charity does not exist any longer. The Lord's Church is also compared to the times of day, its earliest time being compared to sunrise, or 
dawn and morning, and its final period to sundown, or evening and the shadows that fall then; for there is indeed a similarity between the two. In like manner the Church is compared to the seasons of 
the year, its earliest time being compared to spring when everything is flowering, while the time next to the last is compared to autumn when everything starts to die off. Indeed, the Church is also 
compared to metals, its first time being called golden, its last that of iron and clay, as in <a href="http://bible.gospelcom.net/cgi-bin/bible?passage=Daniel%202:31-33&amp;version=ESV&amp;interface=print&amp;showfn=yes&amp;showxref">Daniel 2:31-33</a>. These considerations show what is meant by 'as the sun was going down', namely that the period 
of time and the state just before the close are meant, for the sun had not yet gone down. In what follows the subject is the state of the Church when the sun had gone down, at which point thick 
darkness descended, and a smoking furnace and a flaming torch passed between the pieces. </p>

</p><b>1837.</b>
'Fuit sol ad occidendum': quod significet tempus et statum ante consummationem, constat a significatione 'solis'; sol in sensu interno significat Dominum, et inde caelestia quae sunt amoris et charitatis, 
proinde ipsam amorem et charitatem, de qua prius n. 30-38, et n. 1053; inde patet quod 'occasus solis' sit ultimam tempus Ecclesiae, quod vocatur consummatio, cum amplius nulla charitas.  Ecclesia 
Domini comparatur quoque temporibus diei, prima ejus aetas ortui solis seu aurorae et mane, ultima occasui solis seu vesperae et umbris quae tunc, nam se similiter habent; pariter comparatur temporibus 
anni, prima ejus aetas veri cum omnia florent, quae ante ultimam autumno, cum incipiunt torpescere; immo etiam comparatur metallis, prima ejus aetas appellatur aurea, ultima ferrea et argillacea, 
ut apud Dan. ii 31-33.  Ex his patet quid significatur per quod 'sol esset ad occidendum'; et quod significet tempus et statum ante consummationem, quia nondum sol occidit; in sequentibus agitur de 
statu Ecclesiae cum sol occidit, quod tunc caligo facta, et fumus furni et fax ignis transiret inter segmenta. </p>
