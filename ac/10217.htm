<h3 align="center" class="ired">属天的奥秘 第10217节</h3>
<h4 align="center"></h4><p><strong>10217</strong>.“按他们被数的”表按它们被安排并布置的次序。这从“数”的含义清楚可知，当论及教会的全部事物，就是信和爱的真理和良善时，“数”是指按次序对它们的安排并布置，所以“被数的”表示已经按次序被安排并布置的事物。“数”具有这种含义是因为，数意味着审判，主所审判的东西也被祂按次序安排并布置。此外，在此用来表达数算概念的词在原文表示审查、数算、注意，以及察访、命令、控制，从而按次序安排并布置。这个词具有这些含义，是因为就灵义而言，这些活动当中的每一个都包含下一个，灵义就是这些话的内义，内义经常包含在语言，尤其东方语言的话语中。<br />就灵义，就是以信之真理和良善为主题的这层意义而言，“数”表示按次序安排并布置，这一点也从可圣言中提到动词“数或数点”，或名词“数或数目”的经文明显看出来，如下列经文：<br />列族的国喧哗的嘈声聚集！万军之耶和华正在数点（按次序安排）打仗的军队。（以赛亚书<a href="http://39-27.cn/赛13.4.htm">13:4</a>）<br />以赛亚书：<br />你们向高处举目观看；谁创造这些呢？是那按数目领出其万象的；祂按着名称呼它们。因大有权柄，满有能力，连一个人都不缺。（以赛亚书<a href="http://39-27.cn/赛40.26.htm">40:26</a>）<br />诗篇：<br />数点星宿数目的耶和华给它们都起了名字。（诗篇<a href="http://39-27.cn/诗147.4.htm">147:4</a>）<br />在这些经文中，“数点”表示按次序安排并布置，因为它们论及耶和华，也就是主，主不会数点任何军队、星宿，而是按次序安排并布置“军队”和“星宿”所表示的那些事物，就是信和爱的真理和良善。因为所论述的主题不是自然界的战争，而是灵界的战争，也就是源于良善的真理与邪恶所产生的虚假的争战。“战争”在灵义上是指这类争战（参看<a href="1664.htm">1664</a>，<a href="2686.htm">2686</a>，<a href="8273.htm">8273</a>，<a href="8295.htm">8295</a>节）；“军队”是指属于教会和天堂的真理和良善（<a href="7988.htm">7988</a>，<a href="8019.htm">8019</a>节）；“星宿”是指关于真理和良善的认知或知识（<a href="2495.htm">2495</a>，<a href="2849.htm">2849</a>，<a href="4697.htm">4697</a>节）。<br />一旦知道“数”和“以色列人”表示什么，就能看出为何大卫不可数点百姓，为何他数点之后，先知迦得被派到他那里宣布惩罚（撒母耳记下<a href="http://39-27.cn/撒下24.1.htm">24:1</a>-<a href="http://39-27.cn/撒下24.15.htm">15</a>）；又为何此处（出埃及记<a href="http://39-27.cn/出30.12.htm">30:12</a>）说“各人要为自己的灵魂作赎价，免得被数的时候在他们中间有灾祸”。因为“以色列人”表示教会的真理和良善，“数”表示按次序安排并布置。由于唯独主按次序安排并布置教会和天堂中与每个人同在的信和爱之真理和良善，所以当人来数点时，如大卫通过约押所行的那样，它就表示这些事物是由人而不是由主按次序来安排并布置的；这不是按次序安排或布置，而是摧毁。如果数点以色列人没有包含这类事物在里面，那么数点他们根本不会有什么罪或罪责。<br />“以色列人”表示属灵的真理和良善，也就是教会和天堂的真理和良善（参看<a href="5414.htm">5414</a>，<a href="5801.htm">5801</a>，<a href="5803.htm">5803</a>，<a href="5812.htm">5812</a>，<a href="5817.htm">5817</a>，<a href="5819.htm">5819</a>，<a href="5826.htm">5826</a>，<a href="5833.htm">5833</a>，<a href="5879.htm">5879</a>，<a href="5951.htm">5951</a>，<a href="7957.htm">7957</a>，<a href="8234.htm">8234</a>，<a href="8805.htm">8805</a>节）；以色列被划分为的各支派差不多也是这个意思（<a href="3858.htm">3858</a>，<a href="3926.htm">3926</a>，<a href="4060.htm">4060</a>，<a href="6335.htm">6335</a>，<a href="6397.htm">6397</a>节）。由于“以色列人”和“各支派”表示这类事物，并且这些事物是数不胜数的，所以圣言论到它们 说：<br />他们的数目必如海沙，不可量，不可数。（何西阿书<a href="http://39-27.cn/何1.10.htm">1:10</a>）<br />民数记：<br />谁能数点雅各的尘土和以色列的数目呢？（民数记<a href="http://39-27.cn/民23.10.htm">23:10</a>）<br />耶和华对亚伯拉罕说：<br />我要使你的种如同地上的尘沙，人若能数算地上的尘沙，才能数算你的种。（创世记<a href="http://39-27.cn/创13.16.htm">13:16</a>；<a href="http://39-27.cn/创16.10.htm">16:10</a>）<br />别处：<br />你若能数得过来，就向天观看，数算众星。你的种将要如此。（创世记<a href="http://39-27.cn/创15.5.htm">15:5</a>）<br />“以色列人”和“亚伯拉罕的种”不是指他的后裔，而是指属灵的真理和良善，它们数不胜数，而且大部分是无法描述的。这一点从以下事实可以看出来：他们的人数并不比其它任何民族的多，如摩西所见证的：<br />耶和华倾心于你们，拣选你们，并非因你们的人数多于众民，其实你们的人数比众民都少。（申命记<a href="http://39-27.cn/申7.7.htm">7:7</a>）<br />此外，在耶利米书中，“数点”表示按次序安排并布置：<br />在耶路撒冷和犹大的城邑，必再有羊群从数点的人手下经过。（耶利米书<a href="http://39-27.cn/耶33.13.htm">33:13</a>）;<br />“羊群”也表示教会的良善和真理（<a href="6048.htm">6048</a>，<a href="8937.htm">8937</a>，<a href="9135.htm">9135</a>节）；而“从数点的人手下”表示照着主布置的次序。诗篇：<br />谁晓得你怒气的威力？求你教我们数算我们的日子，好叫我们得着智慧的心。（诗篇<a href="http://39-27.cn/诗90.12.htm">90:12</a>）<br />“数算日子”表示按次序安排并布置生命的状态；日子按次序被安排并布置后，因而当它们结束时，经上就说它们被“数算”，如在下列经文中：<br />正在我中年之日，必进入阴间的门；至于我余剩的年岁，我已经数算。（以赛亚书<a href="http://39-27.cn/赛38.10.htm">38:10</a>）<br />但以理书：<br />在尼布甲尼撒王面前显出的文字是：数算，称量，分裂。（但以理书<a href="http://39-27.cn/但5.25.htm">5:25</a>）<br />当“数算”表示按次序安排并布置时，被“数算的”表示结束之物，或得出结果的东西，如在完成计算后在数字下面画一条直线时。<br />“数算（或数、数点）”表示按次序安排并布置，是因为“数字”表示某种事物或某种状态的具体品质，这种品质由附加于它的数字来界定。因此，“数算（或数、数点）”某种东西表示带给它具体的品质，属灵事物上的具体品质通过它们被主按次序安排并布置带来。这就是启示录中的“数目”所表示的：<br />他又叫众人都在右手上，或是在额上，受一个印记。除了那受印记，有了兽名，或有兽名数目的，都不得作买卖。在这里有智慧。凡有聪明的，可以算计兽的数目，因为这是人的数目。他的数目是六百六十六。（启示录<a href="http://39-27.cn/启13.16.htm">13:16</a>-<a href="http://39-27.cn/启13.18.htm">18</a>）<br />本章论述的主题是从海中上来的兽和从地中上来的兽；“从海中上来的兽”表示通过源于世界的记忆知识而被歪曲的教会真理；“从地中上来的兽”表示通过用来支持爱自己爱世界的邪恶的圣言字义而被歪曲的教会真理。因为“地”表示良善和真理方面的教会（参看<a href="9325.htm">9325</a>节提到的地方）；“海”表示一般的记忆知识（<a href="28.htm">28</a>，<a href="2120.htm">2120</a>，<a href="2850.htm">2850</a>节）。“在右手上，或是在额上，受一个印记”表示接受并喜爱这些虚假；“有了兽名，或有兽名数目”表示接受一切事物，无论它们是什么样子。因为“额”表示爱（<a href="9936.htm">9936</a>节），“名”表示正在被论述之物的一切品质或全部性质（<a href="3006.htm">3006</a>，<a href="3421.htm">3421</a>，<a href="6674.htm">6674</a>，<a href="8274.htm">8274</a>，<a href="9310.htm">9310</a>节）。<br />“算计兽的数目”表示检查并知道这些被歪曲的教会真理；“人的数目”表示教会的现实和状态；“六百六十六”表示就其整体上一切被歪曲的真理和由邪恶所产生的虚假而言，它的具体品质，还有它对圣物的亵渎，以及它的结束。知道这些事并检查它们是一个拥有智慧和理解力之人的一个属性，这就是为何经上说“在这里有智慧。凡有聪明的，可以算计兽的数目”。事实上，数字“六”和数字“十二”具有相同的含义，因为它是十二的一半（<a href="3960.htm">3960</a>e，<a href="7973.htm">7973</a>，<a href="8148.htm">8148</a>节）; “十二”表示教会整体上所拥有的一切真理和良善（<a href="2129.htm">2129</a>e，<a href="2130.htm">2130</a>e，<a href="3272.htm">3272</a>，<a href="3858.htm">3858</a>，<a href="3913.htm">3913</a>，<a href="7973.htm">7973</a>节），因此也在反面意义上表示整体上的一切虚假和邪恶。数字“六”的三倍也意味着结束，当真理被完全亵渎时，结束就到来了。<br />从这一切很明显地看出，圣言中的数字都与不同的事物和状态有关，每个数字都表示一种与数值一致的一种具体品质，如在启示录中的这些话中：<br />天使量了圣耶路撒冷的城墙，按着人的尺寸，就是天使的尺寸，共有一百四十四肘。（启示录<a href="http://39-27.cn/启21.17.htm">21:17</a>）;<br />在这段经文中，数值也表示整体上源于良善的一切真理，因为“一百四十四”和“十二”有相同的含义（<a href="7973.htm">7973</a>节），它是十二与十二的乘积。因此，经上在此还说它的尺寸是“按着人的尺寸”，正如前面经上说，这个数目“是人的数目”。但由于此处所表示的是源于良善的真理，所以经上补充说，这个尺寸也是“天使的尺寸”；事实上，在圣言中，“一位天使（或使者）”表示源于良善的真理，因为他是来自主的神性真理的一个接受者（参看<a href="8192.htm">8192</a>节）。</p>

As to those who are numbered of them. That this signifies a setting in order and disposing, is evident from the signification of "numbering," when said of all things of the church, which are the truths 
and goods of faith and love, as being the setting in order and the disposing of them, consequently "those who were numbered" signify what has been set in order and disposed. "Numbering" has this signification 
because numbering involves survey, and that which is surveyed by the Lord is also set in order and disposed. Moreover, the word by which numbering is here expressed, in the original tongue 
means to survey, to estimate, to observe, and also to visit, to command, to preside, thus to set in order and dispose. That these significations belong to this word is because in the spiritual sense 
the one thing involves the other, and the spiritual sense is the interior sense of the words, which sense is often contained in the words of languages, especially of the oriental languages.  [2] That 
in the spiritual sense, in which sense the truths and goods of faith and love are treated of, "to number" denotes to set in order and dispose, is evident also from the passages in the Word where "numbering" 
is spoken of, and also "number," as in the following: </p>
<p>     The voice of a tumult of the kingdoms of the nations gathered together; Jehovah Zebaoth numbers (setteth in order) the army of war (Isa. 
13:4).      Lift up your eyes on high, and see who hath created these; He that hath brought forth by number their army; He calleth them all by name; of the multitude of the powerful and of the mighty 
in strength, not a man is lacking (Isa. 40:26).      Jehovah who numbers the army of the stars; He calleth all by names (Ps. 147:4). That by "numbering" in these passages is signified to set in 
order and dispose, is plain, for it is said of Jehovah, that is, the Lord, who does not number any army, or stars, but sets in order and disposes those things which are signified by an "army" and by 
"stars," which are the truths and goods of faith and love; for the subject treated of is not wars in the natural world, but wars in the spiritual world, which are wars or combats of truths from good 
against falsities from evil. (That "wars" in the spiritual sense denote such combats, see n. 1664, 2686, 8273, 8295; that an "army" denotes the truths and goods of the church and of heaven, n. 7988, 8019; 
and that "stars" denote the knowledges of truth and good, n. 2495, 2849, 4697.)  [3] When it is known what is signified by "numbering," and by " the sons of Israel," it can be seen why it was not 
allowable for David to number the people, and why after he numbered them, Gad the prophet was sent to him, who declared the penalty (2 Sam. 24:1-15); and why it is here said that "everyone should give 
an expiation of his soul, that there be no plague in them in numbering them." For by "the sons of Israel" are signified the truths and goods of the church, and by "numbering" is signified to set in 
order and dispose; and because it is of the Lord alone to set in order and dispose the truths and goods of faith and of love with everyone in the church and in heaven, therefore when this is done by 
a man, as it was done by David through Joab, it then signifies the setting in order and disposing of such things by man, and not by the Lord, which is not to set in order and dispose, but to destroy. 
If the numbering of the sons of Israel had not involved such things, there would not have been any sin or guilt in numbering them. [4] (That by "the sons of Israel" are signified spiritual truths and 
goods, which are the truths and goods of the church and of heaven, see n. 5414, 5801, 5803, 5812, 5817, 5819, 5826, 5833, 5879, 5951, 7957, 8234, 8805; in like manner by the tribes into which the sons 
of Israel were divided, n. 3858, 3926, 4060, 6335, 6397.) As by "the sons of Israel" and by the "tribes" such things are signified, and these are innumerable, therefore in the Word it is said of them 
that: </p>
<p>     Their number should be as the sand of the sea, which shall not be measured, nor numbered (Hosea 1:10).      Who will number the dust of Jacob, and the number of Israel? (Num. 23:10).  
    Jehovah said to Abraham, I will make thy seed as the dust of the earth; so that if one can number the dust of the earth, it shall be that thy seed will be numbered (Gen. 13:16; 16:10).      Look 
up toward heaven, and number the stars, if thou be able to number them. So shall thy seed be (Gen. 15:5). That by "the sons of Israel," and by "the seed of Abraham," was not meant their posterity; but 
spiritual truths and goods, which are innumerable, and also for the most part unutterable, can be seen from the fact that there was not a greater multitude of them than of other nations, which also 
Moses testifies: </p>
<p>     Not because of your multitude above all peoples hath Jehovah desired you, that He should choose you, for indeed ye are fewer than all peoples (Deut. 7:7). [5] Moreover, by "numbering" 
is signified to set in order and dispose, in Jeremiah: </p>
<p>     In the cities of Jerusalem and of Judah shall the flocks yet pass over according to the hands of him that numbers them (Jer. 33:13); </p>
<p>"flocks" 
also denote the goods and truths of the church (n. 6048, 8937, 9135); "according to the hands of him that numbers" denotes according to the disposing of the Lord. In David: </p>
<p>     Who knoweth 
the vehemence of Thine anger? For numbering our days, make known what is right, that we may put on a heart of wisdom (Ps. 90:12); </p>
<p>"to number days" denotes to set in order and dispose the states of 
life; and days are said to be "numbered" when they are set in order and disposed, thus when they are finished, as in these passages: </p>
<p>     By the letting out of my days I shall go away unto the gates 
of hell; I have been numbered as to the residue of my years (Isa. 38:10); </p>
<p>     A writing appeared before King Belshazzar: Numbered, Weighed, and Divided (Dan. 5:25); </p>
<p>for when "to number" signifies 
to set in order and dispose, then what is "numbered" signifies what is finished, as when a line is drawn under numbers on completing the calculation. [6] That by "numbering" is signified to set in order 
and dispose, is because by "number" is signified the quality of a thing and of a state, and the quality is determined by the adjoined number; hence "to number" denotes to qualify, and in spiritual 
things qualification is effected by a setting in order and a disposing by the Lord. This is signified by "number" in John: </p>
<p>     He causeth that he give to all a mark upon their right hand or upon their 
foreheads, and that no one can buy or sell save he that hath the mark or the name of the beast, or the number of his name. Here is wisdom. Let him that hath intelligence count the number of the beast; 
for it is the number of a man; namely, the number six hundred and sixty-six (Rev. 13:16-18). [7] The subject treated of in this chapter is the beast out of the sea and the beast out of the earth; 
by the "beast out of the sea" is meant the truth of the church falsified by means of memory-knowledges which are from the world; and by the "beast out of the earth" is meant the truth of the church 
falsified by means of the literal sense of the Word applied to favor the evils of the loves of self and of the world; for the "earth" denotes the church as to good and truth (see the places cited in n. 
9325; and the "sea" denotes memory-knowledge in general, n. 28, 2850, 2120). "To have his mark upon the hand and upon the forehead" denotes to acknowledge all things no matter what they may be; for 
the "forehead" signifies love (n. 9936); and a "name" signifies all the quality of that which is being treated of (n. 3006, 3421, 6674, 8274, 1930). [8] "To count the number of the beast" denotes to 
explore and know these falsified truths of the church; "the number of a man" signifies the subject and the state of the church; "six hundred and sixty-six" signifies its quality as to all truths falsified 
from evil, and also the profanation of what is holy, and likewise the end. To know these things, and to explore them, is the part of a wise and intelligent man, and therefore it is said, "this is 
wisdom, let him that hath intelligence count its number;" for the number "six" signifies the same as the number "twelve," because it is the half of it (n. 3960, 7973, 8148); and "twelve" signifies all 
the truths and goods of the church in the complex (n. 2129, 2130, 3272, 3858, 3913, 7973), hence also in the opposite sense it signifies all falsities and evils in the complex. The trebling of the number 
six also involves the end, and the end is when truth is completely profaned. [9] From all this it is very evident that numbers in the Word involve things and states, and signify quality according 
to the numbers fixed upon, as also in the following words in John: </p>
<p>     The angel measured the wall of the holy Jerusalem a hundred and forty-four cubits, which is the measure of a man, that is, of 
an angel (Rev. 21:17); </p>
<p>by the number fixed upon in this passage are also signified all truths and goods in the complex, for "a hundred and forty-four" signifies the same as "twelve" (n. 7973), for 
it arises from twelve multiplied into itself; and therefore it is here said that its "measure is the measure of a man," as above that this number is "the number of a man;" but as truths from good are 
here signified, it is added that this measure is also "the measure of an angel," for "an angel" in the Word signifies truths from good, because he is a recipient of Divine truth from the Lord (see n. 8192). </p>

<p align="center"><b>Elliott(1983-1999) 10217</b></p><p><b>10217.</b>
'As they have been numbered' means as they have been arranged and set in order. This is clear from the meaning of 'numbering' - when it refers to all things of the Church, which are truths and forms 
of the good of faith and love - as an arrangement and setting of them in order, so that 'those who have been numbered' means the things which have been arranged and set in order. 'Numbering' has this 
meaning because numbering implies reviewing, and that which the Lord reviews is also arranged and set in order by Him. Furthermore the word used here to express the idea of numbering means in the original 
language reviewing, counting up, taking note of, and also visiting, giving orders, and taking control of, thus arranging and setting in order. That word has these meanings because in the spiritual 
sense each of these activities implies the next, and the spiritual sense consists in that inner meaning which the words of languages, especially eastern ones, frequently possess.  </p>
<p></p>
<p><b>[2]</b>
 The fact that 
in the spiritual sense, in which truths and forms of the good of faith and love are the subject, 'numbering' means arranging and setting in order is also clear from places in the Word in which the 
verb 'numbering' or else the noun 'number' is used, as in Isaiah,  </p>
<blockquote>
The noise of a tumult of the kingdoms of the nations gathered together! Jehovah Zebaoth is numbering (arranging in order) an army 
of war. <a href="http://bible.gospelcom.net/cgi-bin/bible?passage=Isa%2013:4&amp;version=ESV&amp;interface=print&amp;showfn=yes&amp;showxref">Isa 13:4</a>.  
</blockquote>
<p>In the same prophet,  </p>
<blockquote>
Lift up your eyes on high and see; who created these? He who brought out their host by number; He calls them all by name. From the multitude of the powerful 
and of the mighty not a man is lacking in strength. <a href="http://bible.gospelcom.net/cgi-bin/bible?passage=Isa%2040:26&amp;version=ESV&amp;interface=print&amp;showfn=yes&amp;showxref">Isa 40:26</a>.  
</blockquote>
<p>In David,  </p>
<blockquote>
Jehovah who counts the number<A name="fntext1"></a><A href="#fn1"><sup>a</sup></a> of the stars gives names to them all. <a href="http://bible.gospelcom.net/cgi-bin/bible?passage=Ps%20147:4&amp;version=ESV&amp;interface=print&amp;showfn=yes&amp;showxref">Ps 147:4</a>.  
</blockquote>
<p>In these places it is self-evident 
that 'numbering' means arranging and setting in order, for they refer to Jehovah, that is, the Lord, who does not number any army or count the stars, but arranges and sets such things in order as 
are meant by 'an army' and 'the stars', namely truths and forms of the good of faith and love. For the subject is not wars in the natural world but wars in the spiritual world, which are the wars or 
conflicts of truths springing from good against falsities arising from evil.  </p>
<p>'Wars' in the spiritual sense are those kinds of conflicts, see <a href="1664.htm">1664</a>, <a href="2686.htm">2686</a>, <a href="8273.htm">8273</a>, <a href="8295.htm">8295</a>.  'An army' is the truths and 
forms of good belonging to the Church and heaven, <a href="7988.htm">7988</a>, <a href="8019.htm">8019</a>.  'The stars' are cognitions or knowledge of truth and good, <a href="2495.htm">2495</a>, <a href="2849.htm">2849</a>, <a href="4697.htm">4697</a>.  </p>

 Once it is known what 'numbering' and 'the children 
of Israel' mean it may be seen why it was that David was not allowed to number the people, and why after he had numbered them the prophet Gad was sent to him to intimate a punishment, <a href="http://bible.gospelcom.net/cgi-bin/bible?passage=2%20Sam%2024:1-15&amp;version=ESV&amp;interface=print&amp;showfn=yes&amp;showxref">2 Sam 24:1-15</a>, 
and why here [in Exod.30:12] it says that each one should make expiation for his soul, that there may be no plague among them when they are numbered. By 'the children of Israel' the Church's truths and 
forms of good are meant, and by 'numbering' arranging and setting in order is meant. The arranging and setting in order of the truths and forms of the good of faith and love that are present with each 
person in the Church and in heaven belongs to the Lord alone. Consequently when such numbering is done by man, as was done by David through Joab, an arranging and setting in order of those things 
by man, and not by the Lord, is meant; and this is not an arranging or setting in order but a destruction. If the numbering of the children of Israel had not held such things within it, no sin or guilt 
at all would have been attached to their being numbered.  </p>
<p></p>
<p><b>[4]</b>
 By 'the children of Israel' spiritual truths and forms of good, which are the Church's and heaven's truths and forms of good, are meant, 
see <a href="5414.htm">5414</a>, <a href="5801.htm">5801</a>, <a href="5803.htm">5803</a>, <a href="5812.htm">5812</a>, <a href="5817.htm">5817</a>, <a href="5819.htm">5819</a>, <a href="5826.htm">5826</a>, <a href="5833.htm">5833</a>, <a href="5879.htm">5879</a>, <a href="5951.htm">5951</a>, <a href="7957.htm">7957</a>, <a href="8234.htm">8234</a>, <a href="8805.htm">8805</a>.  Much the same is meant by 'the tribes' into which the children of Israel were divided, <a href="3858.htm">3858</a>, <a href="3926.htm">3926</a>, <a href="4060.htm">4060</a>, <a href="6335.htm">6335</a>, <a href="6397.htm">6397</a>. 
 </p>
<p>Since such things are meant by 'the children of Israel' and 'the tribes' and those things are countless, the Word states regarding them,  </p>
<blockquote>
Their number will be as the sand of the sea, which 
will not be measured nor numbered. <a href="http://bible.gospelcom.net/cgi-bin/bible?passage=Hosea%201:10&amp;version=ESV&amp;interface=print&amp;showfn=yes&amp;showxref">Hosea 1:10</a>.  
</blockquote>
Who will number the dust of Jacob and the number of Israel? <a href="http://bible.gospelcom.net/cgi-bin/bible?passage=Num%2023:10&amp;version=ESV&amp;interface=print&amp;showfn=yes&amp;showxref">Num 23:10</a>.  </p>
<p>Jehovah said to Abraham,  </p>
<blockquote>
I will make your seed as the dust of the earth, 
so that if anyone can number the dust of the earth, so also will it be that your seed may be numbered. <a href="http://bible.gospelcom.net/cgi-bin/bible?passage=Gen%2013:16;%2016:10&amp;version=ESV&amp;interface=print&amp;showfn=yes&amp;showxref">Gen 13:16; 16:10</a>.  
</blockquote>
<p>And elsewhere,  </p>
<blockquote>
Look towards heaven and number the stars, if you are 
able to number them. So will your seed be. <a href="http://bible.gospelcom.net/cgi-bin/bible?passage=Gen%2015:5&amp;version=ESV&amp;interface=print&amp;showfn=yes&amp;showxref">Gen 15:5</a>.  
</blockquote>
<p>The expressions 'the children of Israel' and 'the seed of Abraham' were not used to mean his descendants but spiritual truths and forms of good, 
which are countless and also for the most part beyond description. This becomes clear from the consideration that they were no greater in number than any other nation, as also Moses bore witness, 
 </p>
<blockquote>
Jehovah has desired you, that He might choose you, not because you are more in number than all peoples; indeed you are fewer than all peoples. <a href="http://bible.gospelcom.net/cgi-bin/bible?passage=Deut%207:7&amp;version=ESV&amp;interface=print&amp;showfn=yes&amp;showxref">Deut 7:7</a>.  
</blockquote>
<p></p>
<p><b>[5]</b>
 'Numbering' again means arranging 
and setting in order in Jeremiah,  </p>
<blockquote>
In the cities of Jerusalem and Judah flocks will again pass under the hands of him who numbers them. <a href="http://bible.gospelcom.net/cgi-bin/bible?passage=Jer%2033:13&amp;version=ESV&amp;interface=print&amp;showfn=yes&amp;showxref">Jer 33:13</a>.  
</blockquote>
<p>By 'flocks' too the Church's forms of good and 
its truths are meant, <a href="6048.htm">6048</a>, <a href="8937.htm">8937</a>, <a href="9135.htm">9135</a>, while 'under the hands of him who numbers them' means according to the order set by the Lord. In David,  </p>
<blockquote>
Who knows the strength of Your anger? Teach us<A name="fntext2"></a><A href="#fn2"><sup>b</sup></a> to 
number our days, that we may gain<A name="fntext3"></a><A href="#fn3"><sup>c</sup></a> a heart of wisdom. <a href="http://bible.gospelcom.net/cgi-bin/bible?passage=Ps%2090:11,12&amp;version=ESV&amp;interface=print&amp;showfn=yes&amp;showxref">Ps 90:11,12</a>.  
</blockquote>
<p>'Numbering days' stands for arranging and setting states of life in order; and days are said to be numbered after they have 
been arranged and set in order, thus when they are finished, as in Isaiah,  </p>
<blockquote>
Through the cutting off of my days<A name="fntext4"></a><A href="#fn4"><sup>d</sup></a> I shall go away to the gates of hell; I am numbered [as to]<A name="fntext5"></a><A href="#fn5"><sup>e</sup></a> the residue of my 
years. <a href="http://bible.gospelcom.net/cgi-bin/bible?passage=Isa%2038:10&amp;version=ESV&amp;interface=print&amp;showfn=yes&amp;showxref">Isa 38:10</a>.  
</blockquote>
<p>And in Daniel,  </p>
<blockquote>
The writing appeared before Belshazzar the king, Numbered, weighed, and divided. <a href="http://bible.gospelcom.net/cgi-bin/bible?passage=Dan%205:25&amp;version=ESV&amp;interface=print&amp;showfn=yes&amp;showxref">Dan 5:25</a>.  
</blockquote>
<p>When 'numbering' means arranging and setting in order, 'numbered' 
means what is brought to a conclusion, as when a line is drawn under a list of figures at the end of a calculation.  </p>
<p></p>
<p><b>[6]</b>
 'Numbering' means arranging and setting in order because 'number' means 
the specific quality of some reality or some state, and that quality is defined by the number attached to it. Consequently numbering something means bringing specific quality to it, and specific quality 
is brought to spiritual realities through their being arranged and set in order by the Lord. This is what 'the number' means in John,  </p>
<blockquote>
He causes all to receive<A name="fntext6"></a><A href="#fn6"><sup>f</sup></a> a mark on their right hand 
or on their foreheads, and no one to be able to buy or sell except him who has the mark, or the name of the beast, or the number of its name. Here<A name="fntext7"></a><A href="#fn7"><sup>g</sup></a> is wisdom. Let him who has intelligence reckon 
the number of the beast, for it is the number of a man (homo), that is, its number is six hundred and sixty-six. <a href="http://bible.gospelcom.net/cgi-bin/bible?passage=Rev%2013:16-18&amp;version=ESV&amp;interface=print&amp;showfn=yes&amp;showxref">Rev 13:16-18</a>.  
</blockquote>
<p></p>
<p><b>[7]</b>
 This chapter deals with the beast from the sea and the beast from 
the land. 'The beast from the sea' means the Church's truth falsified by factual knowledge derived from the world, and 'the beast from the land' means the Church's truth falsified by the use of the 
literal sense of the Word to support the evils of self-love and love of the world. For 'the land' means the Church in respect of its goodness and truth, see the places referred to in <a href="9325.htm">9325</a>; and 'the sea' 
means factual knowledge in general, <a href="28.htm">28</a>, <a href="2120.htm">2120</a>, <a href="2850.htm">2850</a>. 'Having its mark on the hand and on the forehead' means accepting and loving those falsities; 'having its name' or 'the number of its name' means 
accepting all things, irrespective of what they are like. For 'the forehead' means the love, <a href="9936.htm">9936</a>, and 'name' the whole nature of the one who is the subject, <a href="3006.htm">3006</a>, <a href="3421.htm">3421</a>, <a href="6674.htm">6674</a>, <a href="8274.htm">8274</a>, <a href="9310.htm">9310</a>. </p>
<p><b>[8]</b>
 'Reckoning 
the number of the beast' means examining and becoming acquainted with those falsified truths of the Church. 'The number of a man' means the reality that is the Church and the state of that Church; 
'six hundred and sixty-six' means its specific quality so far as all its falsified truths and falsities arising from evil in their entirety are concerned, also its profanation of what is holy, and its 
end as well. Being acquainted with them and examining them is an attribute of one who possesses wisdom and understanding, and that is why it says, 'Here<A name="fntext7"></a><A href="#fn7"><sup>g</sup></a> is wisdom. Let him who has intelligence 
reckon its number'. For the number 'six' has the same meaning as the number 'twelve', since it is a half of it, <a href="3960.htm">3960</a>(end), <a href="7973.htm">7973</a>, <a href="8148.htm">8148</a>; and 'twelve' means all the truths and forms of good the Church 
possesses in their entirety, <a href="2129.htm">2129</a>(end), <a href="2130.htm">2130</a>(end), <a href="3272.htm">3272</a>, <a href="3858.htm">3858</a>, <a href="3913.htm">3913</a>, <a href="7973.htm">7973</a>, and therefore also in the contrary sense all falsities and evils in their entirety. The tripling of the digit 'six' also implies 
the end, and the end comes when truth has been made altogether profane.  </p>
<p></p>
<p><b>[9]</b>
 From all this it is plainly evident that numbers in the Word have to do with different realities and states, each serving 
to mean a specific quality that  accords with its numerical value, as also in these words John,  </p>
<blockquote>
The angel measured the wall of the holy Jerusalem, a hundred and forty-four cubits, which is 
the measure of a man (homo), that is, of an angel. <a href="http://bible.gospelcom.net/cgi-bin/bible?passage=Rev%2021:17&amp;version=ESV&amp;interface=print&amp;showfn=yes&amp;showxref">Rev 21:17</a>.  
</blockquote>
<p>The numerical value here serves to mean all truths springing from good in their entirety; for 'a hundred and forty-four' has the same 
meaning as 'twelve', <a href="7973.htm">7973</a>, being the product of twelve multiplied by itself. Therefore also it says in this verse that the measure of it is 'the measure of a man', just as in the verses explained above 
it says that the number given there is 'the number of a man'. But since truths springing from good are meant in this verse it states in addition that that measure is the measure 'of an angel'; for 
in the Word 'an angel' means truths springing from good, an angel being a recipient of Divine Truth from the Lord, <a href="8192.htm">8192</a>.

`Quoad numeratos illorum':  quod significet quoad ordinationem et dispositionem, constat ex significatione `numerare cum de omnibus Ecclesiae, quae sunt vera et bona fidei et amoris, quod sit ordinatio 
et dispositio eorum, inde numerati, sunt quae ordinata et disposita sunt; quod `numerare' id significet, est quia numerare involvit lustrationem, et quod a Domino lustratur, hoc etiam ordinatur et 
disponitur; etiam vox qua exprimitur hic numerare, in lingua originali significat lustrare, censere, animadvertere, et quoque visitare, mandare, praeesse, ita ordinare et disponere; quod hae significationes 
isti voci sint, est quia unum involvit alterum in sensu spirituali, et sensus spiritualis est vocum sensus interior, qui pluries {1}inest vocibus linguarum, praecipue orientalium. 	[2] Quod `numerare' 
in sensu spirituali, in quo agitur de veris et bonis fidei et amoris, sit ordinare et disponere, constat etiam ex locis in Verbo, ubi `numerare' dicitur, et quoque ubi `numerus', ut apud Esaiam, 	Vox 
tumultus regnorum gentium congregatarum, Jehovah Zebaoth numerans (ordinans) exercitum belli, xiii 4: </p>
<p>apud eundem, 	Tollite in altum oculos vestros, et videte quis creavit haec, qui eduxit 
in numerum exercitum eorum, omnes nomine vocat; de multitudine potentium et fortium robore vir non {2}deest, xl 26: </p>
<p>apud Davidem, 	Jehovah Qui numerat {3}numerum stellarum, omnes nominibus vocat, 
Ps. (x)cxlvii 4; </p>
<p>quod per `numerare' {4}in his locis significetur ordinare et disponere, patet, nam agitur de Jehovah, hoc est, Domino, Qui non numerat aliquem exercitum nec stellas, sed ordinat et disponit 
illa quae per {5}exercitum et per stellas significantur, quae sunt vera et bona fidei et amoris, non enim agitur {6} de bellis in mundo naturali sed de bellis in {7}mundo spirituali, quae sunt 
bella {8}seu pugnae verorum ex bono contra falsa ex malo; {9}quod `bella' in spirituali sensu sint tales pugnae, videatur n. 1664, 2686, 8273, 8295, quod `exercitus' {10}sit vera et bona Ecclesiae et 
caeli, {11} n. 7988, 8019, et quod `stellae' sint cognitiones veri et boni, n. 2495, 2849, 4697. 	[3] Cum notum est quid significatur per `numerare' et quid per `filios Israelis,' constare potest quare 
non Davidi {12}licuit numerare populum, et quare, {13}postquam numeravit, Gad propheta ad illum missus {14}denuntiavit (x)poenam, 2 Sam. xxiv 1-15, et quare hic dicitur quod quisque daret expiationem 
animae suae, ne sit in illis plaga in numerando illos; per `filios' enim `Israelis' significantur vera et bona Ecclesiae, et per numerare' significatur ordinare et disponere; et quia solius Domini 
est ordinare et disponere vera et bona fidei et amoris apud unumquemvis in (x)Ecclesia et in caelo, ideo cum id ab homine fit, ut factum a Davide per Joabum, tunc significabat ordinationem et dispositionem 
talium ab homine et non a Domino, quod non est ordinare et disponere, sed destruere; si numeratio filiorum Israelis (t)non talia (x)involvisset, non aliquid peccati aut reatus fuisset in numerando 
illos. Quod per `filios Israelis' significentur vera et bona spiritualia, quae sunt vera et bona Ecclesiae et caeli, videatur n. 5414, 5801, 5803, 5812, 5817, 5819, 5826, 5833, 5879, (x)5951, 7957, 
8234, 8805, similiter per `tribus,' in [4] quas filii Israelis distincti fuerunt, n. 3858, 3926, 4060, 6335, 6397; quia per `filios Israelis' {15}et per `tribus' talia significantur, et illa sunt innumerabilia, 
ideo in Verbo dicitur de {16}illis quod Numerus eorum esset sicut arena maris, quae non mensurabitur nec numerabitur, Hos. l 10: </p>
<p>	Quis numerabit pulverem Jacobi et numerum Israelis, Num. 
xxiii 10: </p>
<p>{17} Jehovah ad Abrahamum, 	Ponam semen tuum ut pulverem terrae, ut si possit numerare pulverem terrae, etiam futurum ut semen tuum numeretur, Gen. xiii (x)16, xvi 10: </p>
<p>et alibi, {18} 	Suspice 
versus caelum, et numera stellas, num potes numerare has, sic erit semen tuum, Gen. xv 5; </p>
<p>quod per `filios Israelis' et `semen Abrahami' {19} non intellecta fuerit posteritas ejus sed vera et 
bona spiritualia, quae innumerabilia {20}, et quoque quoad plurimam partem ineffabilia, constare potest ex eo quod non major multitudo {21}illorum fuerit quam aliarum gentium, quod etiam testatur Moscheh, 	Non 
propter multitudinem vestram prae omnibus populis desideravit Jehovah vos ut eligeret vos, siquidem vos estis pauciores omnibus populis, Deut. vii 7: </p>
<p>etiam per	`numerare' significatur ordinare 
et disponere, apud Jeremiam, [5] 	In urbibus Hierosolymae (x)et Jehudae adhuc transibunt greges juxta manus numerantis, xxxiii 13; </p>
<p>`greges' sunt quoque bona et vera Ecclesiae, n. 6048, 8937, 9135, 
`juxta manus numerantis' est juxta dispositionem Domini: apud Davidem, 	Quis scit vehementiam irae Tuae? ad numerandum dies nostros, rectum notifica, ut induamus cor sapientiae, Ps. (x)xc 11, 12; </p>
<p>`numerare 
dies' pro {22}ordinare et disponere status vitae; {23}et dies dicuntur numerati cum ordinati et dispositi, ita cum finiti, ut apud Esaiam, 	Per {24}excisionem dierum meorum abiturus sum 
ad portas inferni; numeratus sum, residuum annorum meorum, xxxviii 10: </p>
<p>et apud Danielem, 	Scriptura apparuit coram rege Belschazare, numeratus, appensus, et divisus, v 25; </p>
<p>cum enim `numerare' significat 
ordinare et disponere, tunc `numeratum' significat absolutum, sicut cum linea numeris subducta est, finito calculo. 	[6] Quod per `numerare' significetur ordinare et disponere, est quia per `numerum' 
significatur quale rei et status, et quale determinatur per numerum {25}adjunctum, (m)inde numerare est qualificare rem, et qualificatio rei in spiritualibus fit per ordinationem et dispositionem 
a {26}Domino;(n) hoc significatur per `numerum' apud Johannem, 	Facit ut omnibus daret characterem super manum dextram aut super frontes; et ut nemo (x)posset emere aut vendere nisi qui haberet characterem, 
aut nomen bestiae, aut numerum nominis ejus; haec sapientia est; qui habet intelligentiam, computato numerum bestiae, numerus enim hominis est, nempe numerus ejus est sescenta sexaginta sex, 
Apoc. xiii 16-18; </p>
<p>[7] agitur in hoc capite de bestia ex mari, et de bestia ex (x)terra; per `bestiam ex mari' intelligitur verum Ecclesiae falsificatum per scientifica quae e mundo, et per `bestiam 
ex terra' intelligitur verum Ecclesiae falsificatum per sensum {27}litteralem Verbi applicatum ad favendum malis amorum sui et mundi, nam `terra' est Ecclesia quoad {28}bonum et verum, citata n. 9325, 
et `mare' est scientificum in communi, n. 28, (x)2120, 2850; `habere characterem ejus super manum et super frontem' est agnoscere et amare falsa illa; `habere nomen ejus' aut `numerum nominis ejus' 
est agnoscere omnia qualiacumque sunt, `frons' enim significat amorem, n. 9936, et `nomen' significat omne quale {29}ejus de quo agitur, 8 n. 3006, 3421, 6674, 8274, 9310; `computare numerum bestiae' 
est explorare et scire vera illa Ecclesiae falsificata; `numerus hominis' significat rem et statum illius Ecclesiae, {30} `sescenta sexaginta sex' significant quale ejus quoad omnia vera falsificata {31}et 
falsa ex malo in complexu, et quoque profanationem sancti, {32}ut et finem; {33}illa scire et explorare est sapientis et intelligentis, quapropter dicitur, Haec sapientia est; qui habet intelligentiam, 
computato numerum ejus; numerus enim sex significat idem cum numero duodecim, quia est dimidium ejus, n. 3960 fin., 7973, 8148, et duodecim significant omnia vera et bona Ecclesiae in complexu, 
n. 2129 fin., 2130 fin., 3272, 3858, 3913, 7973, inde quoque in opposito sensu omnia falsa et mala in complexu; triplicatio numeri {34}senarii involvit etiam finem, et finis est quando 9 verum prorsus 
(t)est profanatum; ex his manifeste patet quod numeri in Verbo involvant res et status, et significent quale secundum {35}numeros determinatos, ut quoque in {36}his apud Johannem, 	Angelus mensus 
est murum sanctae Hierosolymae centum quadraginta quattuor cubitorum, quae est mensura hominis, hoc est angeli, Apoc. xxi 17; </p>
<p>etiam per numerum {37}ibi determinatum significantur omnia vera {38}ex bono 
in complexu, nam centum quadraginta quattuor idem significant cum duodecim, n. 7973, {39}exsurgit enim ex duodecim in se multiplicatis; {40}quapropter etiam hic dicitur quod mensura {41}ejus sit mensura 
hominis, {42}quemadmodum supra quod numerus ille sit numerus hominis; sed quia hic vera ex bono significantur, additur quod illa mensura etiam sit mensura angeli, `angelus' enim in Verbo significat
