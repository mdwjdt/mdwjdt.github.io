<h4 align="center"></h4><p><strong>3102.</strong>“骆驼喝完了以后”表由一般记忆知识中的启示所产生的承认。这从以下事实，以及“骆驼”和“喝”的含义清楚可知：“以后”和“完了”这两个词表随后的状态，含有前面行为的结束和随后行为的开始（参看<a href="3093.htm">3093</a>节），故在此表示承认，如刚才所示；“骆驼”是指一般记忆知识（参看<a href="3048.htm">3048</a>，<a href="3071.htm">3071</a>节）；“喝”在此和“打水”（参看<a href="3058.htm">3058</a>，<a href="3097.htm">3097</a>节），以及“给喝”（参看<a href="3071.htm">3071</a>节）意思一样，也就是说，是指被启示。由此明显可知，“骆驼喝完了以后”表由一般记忆知识中的启示所产生的承认。<br />真实的情况乃是这样：凡从属世人（也就是记忆知识，或认知和教义，因为这些属于属世人）中被提升出来进入理性人，并在理性人中被接受的真理，必须先被承认它是哪一类，它是否与理性人中的良善一致。它若一致，就被接受；若不一致，就被弃绝。组成一群的表面真理虽然很多，但只有那些承认那里的良善，并与这良善彼此相爱的真理才被联结起来。然而，为叫它们像这样被承认，属世人里面必须有启示，以便属世人中的每一个事物凭此启示同时被看到，从而有选择的余地。在属世人里面，像这样的启示出自良善，仍藉由真理而来（参看<a href="3094.htm">3094</a>节）。该启示就是“利百加给骆驼打水，让它们喝，或给它们喝”所表示的。</p>

And it came to pass when the camels had done drinking. That this signifies acknowledgment from enlightenment in general memory-knowledges, is evident from the fact that the two expressions, "it came 
to pass," and "had done," signify what is successive, and involve the end of the act that precedes and the beginning of the act that follows (see above, n. 3093); here therefore they signify acknowledgment, 
as shown just above. The same is evident also from the signification of "camels," as being general memory-knowledges (see n. 3048, 3071); and from the signification of "drinking," as being here 
the same as "drawing waters" (see n. 3097), and also the same as "giving to drink" (see n. 3058, 3071), namely, being enlightened. Hence it is evident that by these words, "and it came to pass when the 
camels had done drinking," is signified the acknowledgment of truth Divine from enlightenment in general memory-knowledges.  [2] The case is really this: Every truth that is elevated out of the natural 
man, that is, out of memory-knowledges (or out of knowledges and doctrinal things, for these are of the natural man) into the rational, and there received, must first be acknowledged for what it 
is, and whether it is in agreement with the good that is in the rational or not; if it is in agreement, it is received; and if not, it is rejected. There are many apparent truths in a single company; 
but only those are conjoined which acknowledge the good there, and thus which mutually love each other. In order, however, that they may be acknowledged to be such, there must be enlightenment in the 
natural man, by which all things there both in general and in particular may be seen at one view, and that thus there may be choice. This enlightenment in the natural man is from good, but still is by 
means of truth (see n. 3094). It is this enlightenment that is signified by Rebekah's drawing for the camels, and making them drink, or giving them to drink. </p>

'And so it was, when the camels finished drinking' means acknowledgement resulting from enlightenment in general facts. This is clear from the fact that the two expressions 'it was' and 'they finished' 
mean a subsequent stage and imply the end of the activity which precedes, and the beginning of the activity which follows, dealt with above in <a href="3093.htm">3093</a>, and so mean acknowledgement, as shown above; from 
the meaning of 'the camels' as general facts, dealt with in <a href="3048.htm">3048</a>, <a href="3071.htm">3071</a>; and from the meaning of 'drinking' here as the same as that meant by 'drawing water', as above in <a href="3058.htm">3058</a>, <a href="3097.htm">3097</a>, and also by 'being 
given a drink', as above in <a href="3071.htm">3071</a>, that is to say, being enlightened. From this it is evident that the words 'and so it was, when the camels finished drinking' means acknowledgement- that is to say, 
of Divine truth - resulting from the enlightenment in general facts. </p>
<p></p>
<p><b>[2]</b>
 The real situation is as follows: Every truth that is raised up from the natural man - that is, out of facts, or cognitions 
and matters of doctrine since these belong in the natural man - into the rational man, and is received there, must first be acknowledged as to what sort it is, whether it accords with the good that is 
there or not. If it does accord it is received, but if it does not it is rejected. The apparent truths in an attendant group of them are many, but only those are joined which acknowledge the good that 
is there, and so which love good and are loved by good. But in order that they may be acknowledged as such there has to be the enlightenment in the natural man by means of which every single thing 
in the natural man can be seen simultaneously, and so a choice be made. Enlightenment such as this in the natural man comes from good, yet does so by way of truth, see <a href="3094.htm">3094</a>. This enlightenment is what 
is meant by Rebekah's drawing for the camels, causing them to drink, or giving them a drink. </p>

`Et fuit, quando absolverant cameli bibere': quod significet agnitionem ex illustratione in scientificis communibus, constat ex eo quod binae hae expressiones `fuit,' et `absolverunt' significent successivum, 
et involvant finem actus qui praecedit, et principium actus qui sequitur, de {1}quo supra n. 3093, ita hic agnitionem, ut mox supra ostensum; ex significatione `camelorum' quod sint scientifica 
communia, de qua n. 3048, 3071; et ex significatione `bibere' quod hic sit idem ac haurire aquas, ut supra n. 3058, 3097, et quoque `potare,' ut supra n. 3071, nempe illustrari; inde patet quod per 
illa verba, `et fuit quando absolverunt cameli bibere' significetur agnitio, nempe veri Divini ex illustratione in scientificis communibus.  Ipsa res ita se habet: [2] omne verum quod elevatur e naturali 
homine, hoc est, e scientificis, {2}seu cognitionibus et doctrinalibus, nam haec sunt naturalis hominis, in rationalem, et ibi recipitur, primum agnoscetur quodnam sit, num concordet cum bono ibi 
vel non; si concordat, recipitur, {3}et si non concordat, rejicitur; vera apparentia sunt in uno comitatu plura, sed solum illa conjunguntur quae bonum ibi agnoscunt, ita quae se mutuo amant; ut {4}autem 
agnoscantur quod talia sint, erit illustratio in naturali homine, per quam ibi omnia et singula uno intuitu spectari queant, ac sic possit esse electio; illustratio illa in naturali homine est 
a bono, sed usque per verum, videatur n. 3094; haec illustratio est quae significatur per quod `Rebecca hauserit camelis,' `potaverit illos,' aut `dederit iis bibere.' @1 qua$ @2 nempe$ @3 at$ @4 vero$ </p>
