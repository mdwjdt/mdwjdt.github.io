<h3 align="center" class="ired">属天的奥秘 第4529节</h3>
<h4 align="center"></h4><p><strong>4529.</strong>有一个人曾因精通植物学而在学术界享有盛名，死后进入来世，听说在来世也会看到花草树木。听到这话，他感到十分震惊；因为植物学是他一生的乐趣，所以他充满一种渴望，想看看他所听到的是不是真的。于是，他就被带到天堂花园，在那里看到极其美丽的树木种植园和极其漂亮的花园，并且延伸得很远。当时他已进入内心的渴望，故蒙允许在那田野漫步，不仅可以仔细观看那里正在生长的植物，还可以摘下来，拿到眼前，检查它是不是真的是它所看上去的样子。<br />他从那里对我说，像这样的事，他从来就不相信；世人要是听说这种事，必视它们为荒唐。他接着说，那里可见的鲜花，远远比他在世上任何时候所看到的都要丰富得多，几乎无法以任何世俗的鉴赏力来欣赏；每一朵都闪耀着难以想象的光辉，因为它是天堂之光的产物。他还没有意识到，这种闪耀具有一个属灵的起源，也就是说，它们之所以闪耀，是因为它们每一个里面都有某种属于真理和良善的聪明和智慧。他还说，地上的人永远不会相信这一点，因为很少有人相信任何天堂或地狱的存在；那些相信的人只知道天上有喜乐，其中很少有人相信那里竟有诸如眼所未见、耳所未闻、脑子里从未想象出来的那类事物。这种不信是存在的，尽管他们从圣言知道，先知们看见了许多令人惊奇的场景，如约翰就看见了许多，正如启示录所描述的；然而，这些场景只不过是天上不断出现的代表，当约翰的内视被打开时，就被他看到了。<br />但这些事物相对来说并不重要。那些拥有真正的聪明和智慧，也就是这些事物的源头之人，就处于这样一种幸福的状态：所提到的这些事物对他们来说并不怎么重要。还有些灵人在天堂花园里曾说，这些超越了各种幸福；于是，他们被带到一个更向右的天堂，该天堂闪耀着更大的光辉；后来，他们被带到能体验存在于这类事物中的聪明和智慧的幸福所在的天堂。他们在那里对我说，他们之前所看到的，与现在所体验的相比，简直一文不值。最后，他们又被带到一个天堂，在那里，他们几乎无法承受内在情感的幸福，因为这种幸福穿透了他们的骨髓；当他们的骨髓可以说化成幸福时，他们开始陷入一种神圣的昏厥。</p>

A certain person who had been much talked of and celebrated in the learned world for his skill in the science of botany, after death heard in the other life, to his great surprise, that there also flowers 
and trees are presented to view; and as botany had been the delight of his life he was fired with a desire to see whether such was the case, and was therefore carried up into the paradisal regions, 
where he saw most beautiful plantations of trees and most charming flower gardens of immense extent. And as he then came into the ardor of his delight from affection, he was allowed to wander over 
the field, and not only to see the plants in detail, but also to gather them and bring them close to his eye, and to examine whether the case was really so.  [2] Speaking with me from thence he said 
that he could never have believed it, and that if such things had been heard of In the world, they would have been regarded as marvels. He said further that he saw an immense abundance of flowers there 
which are never seen in the world, and of which it would be almost impossible there to form any idea; and that they all glow with an inconceivable brightness, because they are from the light of heaven. 
That the glow was from a spiritual origin, he was not yet able to perceive, that is, that they glowed because there was in each one of them something of the intelligence and wisdom which are of truth 
and good. He went on to say that men on earth would never believe this, because few believe there is any heaven and hell, and they who believe only know that in heaven there is joy, and few among 
them believe that there are such things as eye has not seen, and ear has not heard, and the mind has never conceived; and this although they know from the Word that amazing things were seen by the prophets, 
such as many things seen by John, as recorded in the Revelation, and yet these were nothing else than the representatives which are continually coming forth in heaven, and which appeared to John 
when his internal sight was opened. [3] But these things are comparatively of little moment. They who are in the very intelligence and wisdom which are the source of these things, are in such a state 
of happiness that the things which have been related are to them of slight importance. Some spirits also who when in the paradisal regions said that these surpass every degree of happiness, were therefore 
carried up into a heaven more to the right, which sparkled with a still greater resplendence, and finally they were carried up into the heaven where there is also a perception of the blessedness 
of the intelligence and wisdom that exist in such things. And when they were there, they told me that what they had seen before was comparatively worthless. At last they were carried up into a heaven 
where on account of the bliss of interior affection, they could scarcely subsist, for the bliss penetrated to the very marrows, and these being as it were dissolved away with bliss, they began to 
fall into a holy swoon. </p>

<p align="center"><b>Elliott(1983-1999) 4529</b></p><p><b>4529.</b>
A certain person who had been famous and renowned in the learned world because of his expert knowledge in botany heard in the next life, after he had died, that flowers and trees were to be seen in that 
life also. At this he was astounded, and because botany had been the delight of his life he was burning with the desire to see whether what he had heard was true. He was as a consequence taken to 
the paradise gardens where he saw very beautiful plantations of trees and very lovely flower-beds extending very far. Because he had now entered into his heart's desire he was allowed to wander through 
those grounds and not only to see each thing growing there but also to pluck it, hold it up to his eye and examine whether it was really what it appeared to be. </p>
<p></p>
<p><b>[2]</b>
 He spoke to me from there and 
said that he had never believed anything such as this, and that if people in the world were to hear of such things they would regard them as absurdities. He went on to say that the flowers visible there 
were far more abundant than those he had seen at any time in the world and were scarcely able to be appreciated by any worldly kind of discernment, and that each one sparkled with unimaginable brightness 
because it was a product of the light of heaven. He was not as yet able to perceive that that sparkling had a spiritual origin, namely that in every one there existed some measure of intelligence 
and wisdom - the attributes of truth and good - as the source of their sparkling. He said in addition that people on earth would never believe this because few believe in the existence of any heaven 
or hell; and those who do believe may know merely that there is joy in heaven, few among these believing that things exist there such as the eye has never seen, the ear has never heard, and the mind 
has never been able to contemplate. Such unbelief exists in spite of their knowing from the Word that amazing scenes were seen by the Prophets, like the many seen by John, as described in the Book of 
Revelation, which however were nothing other than representatives which occur continuously in heaven and which were seen by him once his internal sight had been opened. </p>
<p></p>
<p><b>[3]</b>
 But these things are comparatively 
unimportant. People who possess true intelligence and wisdom, in which those representatives originate, dwell in a state of happiness which is such that the things which have been mentioned 
belong among those that are not so important. There have also been others who have said when in the paradise gardens that these surpass every degree of happiness. They were therefore taken into a heaven 
further over to the right whose radiancy was brighter still, and at length to that heaven where they experienced the blessedness of intelligence and wisdom which those representatives hold within 
them. While they were there they spoke to me, saying that the things which they had seen previously were as nothing compared with what they experienced now. At last they were taken to that heaven where 
they were scarcely able to bear the bliss of interior affection, for that bliss pierced them through to the marrow; and when their marrow so to speak was dissolved into bliss they began to sink into 
a holy swoon. </p>

Quidam qui in orbe erudito inclutus et famigeratus propter peritiam in scientia botanica, postquam obiit, in altera vita audivit quod ibi quoque sistantur videndi {1} flores et arbores; ad id obstupuit; 
et quia id jucundum ejus vitae fuerat, accensus est desiderio videndi num ita sit; quare sublatus in paradisiaca vidit arboreta pulcherrima et floreta amoenissima in immensum extensa; et quia 
tunc in sui jucundi ex affectione ardorem venit, licuit illi pervagari campum, et non solum singillatim videre illa, sed etiam excerpere et ad oculum {2} admovere et perscrutari num ita se res haberet; 
[2] ille mecum inde locutus, etiam dixit quod hoc nusquam crediderit, et quod si talia in mundo audivissent, inter paradoxa referrent; et porro referebat quod ibi conspiciantur vegetabiles flores 
immensa copia qui nusquam visi in mundo, et vix aliqua perceptione ibi comprehensibiles, et quod singula ex splendore incomprehensibili rutilent, quia sunt ex luce caeli; quod rutilatio ex spirituali 
origine esset, nondum potuit percipere {3}, nempe quod in singulis aliquid intelligentiae et sapientiae quae veri et boni, ex quibus illis rutilum: dicebat amplius quod homines telluris nullatenus 
hoc credituri, ex causa quia pauci sunt qui credunt quod aliquod {4} caelum et infernum sit, et qui credunt, sciant modo quod in caelo gaudium, et pauci inter illos, quod ibi sint talia quae 
oculus nusquam viderat, auris nusquam audiverat, et mens nusquam cogitare potuerat {5}; et hoc tametsi ex Verbo sciunt quod stupenda visa sint prophetis, sicut plura Johanni, de quibus in Apocalypsi; 
quae tamen non aliud fuerunt quam repraesentativa quae continue existunt in caelo, et quae apparuerunt cum visus internus ei apertus fuit. [3] Sed haec sunt respective levia; qui in ipsa intelligentia 
et sapientia sunt ex quibus illa, in tali felicitatis statu sunt ut illa quae memorata {6}, sint (o)illis inter leviora: quidam etiam qui dixerunt cum in paradisiacis essent, quod excedant 
{7} omnem felicitatis gradum, ideo {8} magis versus dextram sublati in caelum quod adhuc splendidius coruscabat, et tandem ad illud ubi quoque perceptum intelligentiae et sapientiae beatum quod 
in talibus, et tunc cum ibi essent, etiam mecum locuti dicebant {9} quod illa quae prius viderant respective nauci sint; et tandem ad id caelum ubi prae interioris affectionis fausto vix {10} possent 
subsistere, nam faustum penetravit ad medullaria, quibus prae fausto quasi resolutis in sanctum deliquium labi incipiebant.      @1 conspiciendi A, vivendi I$      @2 oculos$      @3 capere$  
    @4 aliquid I$      @5 potuerit$      @6 i sunt$      @7 i illa$      @8 inde$      @9 dixerunt$      @10 non$ </p>
