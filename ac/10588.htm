<h4 align="center"></h4><p><strong>10588</strong>.听了他们所说的话，我不禁怀疑他们的呼吸方式是否与我们星球上的人相似。我被告知，的确相似；但当它以声音的形式出现时，它没有像我们用气管和喉那样分成单独但又相互关联的部分，而且他们的嘴唇不仅因观念流入嘴唇纤维，还因一种内在的肺呼吸而活动。</p>

From hearing their discourse, a doubt occurred concerning their respiration, whether it was similar to that of the men of our earth; and it was said that it is indeed similar, but that it is not articulated 
on the way as it is going forth into sound, as is done with us in the trachea and the larynx; and also that their lips are moved not only by the influx of ideas into their fibers, but also by 
an inward breathing of the lungs. </p>

<p align="center"><b>Elliott(1983-1999) 10588</b></p><p><b>10588.</b>
As a result of hearing what they had to say I was struck by doubt as to whether their manner of breathing was similar to that of people on our planet. I was told that it was indeed similar, but that 
when it comes out in the form of sound it is not divided up on the way into individual yet interconnected parts as it is with us in the trachea and larynx, and also that the movement of their lips is 
attributable not only to the flow of ideas into the fibres composing the lips but also to the internal breathing of the lungs.  </p>

</p><b>10588.</b>
Ex audito illorum sermone incidebat dubitatio de respiratione illorum num illa similis esset respirationi hominum nostrae telluris, et dictum quod quidem similis, sed quod non articuletur in via cum 
abit in sonum, quod fit apud nos in trachea et larynge; tum quod labia eorum moveantur non modo per influxum idearum in fibras eorum, sed etiam per afflatum intrinsecum pulmonicum. </p>
