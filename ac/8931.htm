<h3 align="center" class="ired">属天的奥秘 第8931节</h3>
<h4 align="center"></h4><p><strong>8931.</strong>“你们已经看见我从天上和你们说话了”表通过经由天堂来自神的流注而来的圣言的一切事物。这从“从天上说话”的含义清楚可知，当耶和华从天上向以色列人所代表的教会成员（<a href="8930.htm">8930</a>节）说话时，“从天上说话”是指神之真理，或经由天堂从神而来的圣言。因为耶和华所说的话就是神之真理，因而是存在于教会中的圣言；祂所说的话经由天堂而来。<br />要知道，天堂不在某个固定不变的地方，因而不像普遍所认为的那样在高处。相反，天堂在神性所在的地方，因而与每一个拥有仁与信的人同在，并在他里面；事实上，仁与信就是天堂，因为它们来自神性，并且天使也住在那里。天堂在神性所在的地方，也就是在主所在的地方，这一点之以下事实明显看出来：主从中说话的西乃山在此被称为“天堂”；这也是为何“西乃山”表示天堂，神性真理便从天堂划过（<a href="8805.htm">8805</a>节）。<br />之所以表示圣言的一切，是因为这时耶和华或主开始揭示要为教义和生活而服务于人类的圣言，首先通过摩西，后来通过众先知揭示。因此，为叫人们能知道圣言经由天堂从神性而来，主自己乐意降临，用一种活生生的声音宣布十诫，这样做是为了说明，在律法，也就是圣言中在它们之后到来的其它一切都是以同样的方式通过经由天堂来自神性的流注而来的。</p>

Ye have seen that I have spoken with you from heaven. That this signifies all things of the Word by means of influx from the Divine through heaven, is evident from the signification of "speaking from 
heaven," when by Jehovah to those who are of the church, who are represented by the sons of Israel (n. 8930), as being truth Divine, or the Word from the Divine through heaven; for that which Jehovah 
speaks is truth Divine, thus the Word which is in the church; and that which He speaks passes through heaven. [2] Be it known that heaven is not in any certain and determinate place, thus not, according 
to the common opinion, on high; but heaven is where the Divine is, thus with everyone and in everyone who is in charity and faith; for charity and faith are heaven, because they are from the Divine, 
and there also the angels dwell. That heaven is where the Divine is, that is, where the Lord is, is evident from the fact that Mount Sinai, from which the Lord spoke, is here called "heaven;" and 
this is also the reason why by "Mount Sinai" is signified heaven, from which is Divine truth (n. 8805). [3] That all things of the Word are signified, is because Jehovah or the Lord then began to reveal 
the Word which should serve the human race for doctrine and life, first by Moses, and afterward by the prophets. In order therefore that they might know that the Word was from the Divine through heaven, 
the Lord Himself willed to come down, and with a living voice proclaim the ten commandments, and thus show that all that follows of the law, that is, of the Word, was in like manner by means of 
influx from the Divine through heaven. </p>

<p align="center"><b>Elliott(1983-1999) 8931</b></p><p><b>8931.</b>
'You have seen that I have spoken to you from heaven' means all things in the Word coming through influx from God by way of heaven. This is clear from the meaning of 'speaking from heaven', when done 
by Jehovah addressing members of the Church, who are represented by 'the children of Israel', <a href="8930.htm">8930</a>, as God's truth, or the Word coming from God by way of heaven. For what is spoken by Jehovah is God's 
truth, thus the Word existing within the Church; and what He speaks comes by way of heaven. </p>
<p></p>
<p><b>[2]</b>
 It should be recognized that heaven does not exist in some fixed and exact location; that is, it is 
not up on high, as it is commonly thought to be. Rather heaven exists wherever the Divine is present. This being so, it exists with and within everyone possessing charity and faith, since charity and 
faith are what constitute heaven, because they are what come from the Divine. There also angels live. The truth that heaven is where the Divine, that is, the Lord, is present is evident from the fact 
that Mount Sinai, from which the Lord spoke, is called 'heaven' here. This also is the reason why 'Mount Sinai' means heaven, from which Divine Truth Rows, <a href="8805.htm">8805</a>. </p>
<p></p>
<p><b>[3]</b>
 The reason why all things in the 
Word are meant is that Jehovah or the Lord now begins to reveal the Word that is to serve the human race in what they teach and the way they live, first through Moses and later on through the Prophets. 
In order therefore that people might know that the Word came from the Divine by way of heaven, the Lord Himself was willing to come down and declare the Ten Commandments vocally, and in doing this 
to show that everything else which comes after them in the law, that is, in the Word, came in the same way through influx from the Divine by way of heaven. </p>

`Vos vidistis quod e caelo locutus sim cum vobis': quod significet omnia Verbi per influxum a Divino per caelum, constat ex significatione `e caelo loqui' cum a Jehovah ad illos qui ab Ecclesia, qui 
repraesentantur per `filios Israelis,' (o)n. 8930, quod sit verum Divinum, seu Verbum a Divino per caelum, nam quod loquitur Jehovah est verum Divinum, ita Verbum quod in Ecclesia, et quod loquitur hoc 
transit per caelum. 	[2] Sciendum {1} quod caelum non sit in certo ac determinato aliquo loco, ita non secundum opinionem vulgarem in alto, sed caelum est ubi Divinum, ita {2} apud unumquemvis et 
in unoquovis qui in charitate et fide est, nam charitas et fides sunt caelum; quia sunt a Divino, ibi etiam habitant angeli {3}; quod caelum sit ubi Divinum, hoc est, Dominus, patet ex eo quod mons Sinai, 
e quo Dominus locutus est, hic dicatur caelum; quae etiam causa est quod per `montem Sinai' significetur {4} caelum, unde Divinum Verum, n. 8805. 	[3] Quod omnia Verbi significentur, est quia Jehovah, 
seu {5} Dominus, nunc (x)coepit revelare Verbum quod generi humano pro doctrina et vita inserviret, primum per Moschen et postea per prophetas; ut itaque scirent quod Verbum a Divino per caelum 
esset, voluit Dominus Ipse descendere ac viva voce promulgare decem praecepta, et sic ostendere quod sequentia legis, hoc est, Verbi, similiter per influxum a Divino per caelum essent. @1 i est$ @2
