<h3 align="center" class="ired">属天的奥秘 第2184节</h3>
<h4 align="center"></h4><p><strong>2184.</strong>“奶油”是指理性的属天部分，“奶”是指源于此的属灵部分，“牛犊”是指相应的属世部分。这从“奶油”、“奶”和“牛犊”的含义清楚可知。关于奶油，在圣言中，它因其脂油而表示属天之物。因为“脂油”就表示属天之物，如第一卷所示（<a href="353.htm">353</a>节）；而“油”就是脂油，故是属天之物本身（<a href="886.htm">886</a>节）。“奶油”也是属天之物，这从以赛亚书明显看出来：<br />看哪，必有童女生子，给他起名叫以马内利，到祂晓得弃恶择善的时候，祂必吃奶油与蜂蜜。（以赛亚书<a href="http://39-27.cn/赛7.14.htm">7:14</a>-<a href="http://39-27.cn/赛7.15.htm">15</a>）<br />这论及主，祂就是以马内利；谁都能看出，“奶油”并非指奶油，“蜂蜜”亦非指蜂蜜；“奶油”表示祂的属天层，而“蜂蜜”则表源于属天层的事物。<br />同一章：<br />因为出的奶多，他就得吃奶油；在境内所剩的人都要吃奶油与蜂蜜。（以赛亚书<a href="http://39-27.cn/赛7.22.htm">7:22</a>）<br />这论及主的国度，和世上那些在主国度中的人。“奶”在此表属灵良善，“奶油”表属天良善，而“蜂蜜”则表源于此的幸福。<br />摩西五经：<br />耶和华独自引导他，并无外邦神与他同在。耶和华使他乘驾地的高处，得吃田间的土产；又使他从磐石中咂蜜，从坚石中吸油；也吃牛的奶油、羊的奶、巴珊所出的公绵羊和羊羔的脂油，并山羊的脂油，与麦子的脂油，也喝未与酒掺杂的葡萄汁的脂油。（申命记<a href="http://39-27.cn/申32.12.htm">32:12</a>-<a href="http://39-27.cn/申32.14.htm">14</a>）<br />没有人能理解这些事物表示什么，除非他知道每一个的内义。这看似一堆诸如世上的聪明人所用的雄辩术之类的表述，然而，每一表述都表示属天之物及其属灵之物，以及源于这些的幸福快乐，所有这些都处在井然有序的系列中。“牛的奶油”是指属天-属世之物，“羊的奶”是指理性的属天-属灵之物。<br />然而，至于“奶”，如前所述，它表示源于属天之物的属灵之物，即属天-属灵之物（关于何为属天-属灵之物，可参看第一卷<a href="1577.htm">1577</a>，<a href="1824.htm">1824</a>节等）。“奶”表源于属天之物的属灵之物，其原因在于，“水”表属灵之物 （<a href="680.htm">680</a>，<a href="739.htm">739</a>节）；而“奶”因含有脂肪，故表示属天-属灵之物，或植根于良善的真理，或植根于爱或仁的信，或存在于意愿中的良善的理解力部分，亦或里面有善情（即对良善的情感）的对真理的情感，又或源于对邻之仁的情感的对认知和知识的情感，就是诸如存在于那些爱邻并通过他们因爱邻而所热爱的信之认知和记忆知识确认这爱之人的那种情感。所有这些事物都和属天-属灵之物一样，并按照所论述的主题来使用。<br />所表示的是属天-属灵之物，这也可从圣言明显看出来，如以赛亚书：<br />你们一切干渴的都当就近水来，没有银钱的也可以来买了吃，不用花钱，不付代价，也来买酒和奶。你们为何花钱买那不足为食物的？（以赛亚书<a href="http://39-27.cn/赛55.1.htm">55:1</a>，<a href="http://39-27.cn/赛55.2.htm">2</a>）<br />此处“酒”表信的属灵元素，“奶”表爱的属灵元素。摩西五经：<br />他在葡萄酒中洗了衣服，在葡萄汁中洗了袍褂。他的眼睛比酒红润，他的牙齿比奶洁白。（创世记<a href="http://39-27.cn/创49.11.htm">49:11</a>，<a href="http://39-27.cn/创49.12.htm">12</a>）<br />这是雅各（那时是以色列）关于犹大的预言，“犹大”在此用来描述主。“比奶洁白的牙齿”表示属于其属世之物的属天-属灵之物。<br />约珥书：<br />到那日，大山要滴新酒，小山要流奶子，犹大溪河都有水流。（约珥书<a href="http://39-27.cn/珥3.18.htm">3:18</a>）<br />此处论及主的国度，“奶”表属天-属灵之物。在圣言中，迦南地也代表和表示主的国度，被称为“流奶与蜜之地” （如民数记<a href="http://39-27.cn/民13.27.htm">13:27</a>；<a href="http://39-27.cn/民14.8.htm">14:8</a>；申命记<a href="http://39-27.cn/申26.9.htm">26:9</a>，<a href="http://39-27.cn/申26.15.htm">15</a>；<a href="http://39-27.cn/申27.3.htm">27:3</a>；耶利米书<a href="http://39-27.cn/耶11.5.htm">11:5</a>；<a href="http://39-27.cn/耶32.22.htm">32:22</a>；以西结书<a href="http://39-27.cn/结20.6.htm">20:6</a>，<a href="http://39-27.cn/结20.15.htm">15</a>），在这些经文中，“奶”表示丰盈的属天-属灵之物，并非表示别的东西，“蜂蜜”则表示源于这些的丰沛幸福；“地”是指那国度的属天之物本身，这些事物就出自该国度。<br />关于“牛犊”表属天-属世之物，这在刚才已说明（<a href="2180.htm">2180</a>节）。属天-属世之物和属世良善，即属世之物里面的良善一样。人的属世之物和他的理性一样，也有自己的良善和真理，如前所述（<a href="2173.htm">2173</a>节）。属世之物的良善就是从仁爱，或属于仁爱的友谊当中所感觉到的快乐；完全属于肉体的愉悦或满足就源于这种快乐。属世之物的真理就是支撑那快乐的记忆知识。由此明显可知何为属天-属世之物。</p>

That "butter" is the celestial of the rational; that "milk" is the derivative spiritual; and that a "son of an ox" is the corresponding natural, is evident from the signification of "butter," of "milk," 
and of a "son of an ox." As regards butter, it signifies in the Word what is celestial, and this from its fatness. (That fat denotes what is celestial was shown in volume 1, n. 353; and that "oil," 
because fat, is the celestial itself, n. 886.) That "butter" also is the celestial, is evident in Isaiah: </p>
<p>     Behold, a virgin beareth a son, and shall call His name Immanuel, Butter and honey shall 
He eat, that He may know to refuse what is evil, and choose what is good (Isa. 7:14-15), where the Lord (who is "Immanuel") is treated of; and anyone can see that butter is not signified by "butter," 
nor honey by "honey;" but that by "butter" is signified His celestial, and by "honey" that which is from the celestial. [2] In the same: </p>
<p>     And it shall come to pass, for the multitude of the 
making of milk He shall eat butter; for butter and honey shall everyone eat that is left in the midst of the land (Isa. 7:22), where the Lord's kingdom is treated of, and those on earth who are in the 
Lord's kingdom. "Milk" here denotes spiritual good, "butter" celestial good, and "honey" the derivative happiness. [3] In Moses: </p>
<p>     Jehovah alone leadeth him, and there is no strange god with him. 
He maketh him to ride upon the high places of the earth, and to eat the produce of the fields, and He maketh him to suck honey out of the rock, and oil out of the flint of the rock; butter of the herd, 
and milk of the flock, with the fat of lambs, and of rams the sons of Bashan, and of he-goats, with the fat of the kidneys of wheat; and of the blood of the grape shalt thou drink unmixed wine [merum] 
(Deut. 32:12-14). No one can understand what these things denote unless he knows the internal sense of each one. It appears like a heap of expressions such as are used by the eloquent among the 
wise ones of the world, and yet every expression signifies the celestial and its spiritual, and also the derivative blessedness and happiness, and all these in a well-ordered series. "Butter of the herd" 
is the celestial natural, "milk of the flock" is the celestial-spiritual of the rational. [4] But as regards milk, as before said, this signifies the spiritual from the celestial, that is, the celestial-spiritual. 
(What the celestial-spiritual is may be seen in volume 1, n. 1577, 1824, and occasionally elsewhere.) That "milk" is the spiritual which is from the celestial, comes from the fact 
that "water" signifies what is spiritual (n. 680, 739); but "milk," as there is fat in it, signifies the celestial-spiritual, or what is the same, the truth of good; or what is the same, the faith of 
love or of charity; or what is also the same, the intellectual of the good of the will; and again the same, the affection of truth in which there is inwardly the affection of good; and yet again the same, 
the affection of knowledges [cognitiones et scientiae] from the affection of charity toward the neighbor, such as exists with those who love the neighbor, and confirm themselves in this love from 
the knowledges of faith, and also from memory-knowledges, which they love on this account. All these things are the same as the celestial-spiritual, and are predicated according to the subject treated 
of. [5] That this is signified, is evident also from the Word, as in Isaiah: </p>
<p>     Everyone that thirsteth, come ye to the waters, and he that hath no silver, come ye, buy, and eat; yea come, buy wine 
and milk without silver, and without price. Wherefore do ye weigh silver for that which is not bread? (Isa. 55:1-2), where "wine" denotes the spiritual which is of faith, and "milk" the spiritual 
which is of love. In Moses: </p>
<p>     He hath washed his garment in wine, and his clothing in the blood of grapes; his eyes are redder than wine, and his teeth are whiter than milk (Gen. 49:11-12), which 
is the prophecy of Jacob, then Israel, concerning Judah; and by Judah the Lord is here described, and by his "teeth being whiter than milk," is signified the celestial-spiritual that pertained to His 
natural. [6] In Joel: </p>
<p>     It shall be in that day that the mountains shall drop new wine, and the hills shall flow with milk; and all the brooks of Judah shall flow with waters (Joel 3:18), speaking 
of the Lord's kingdom; "milk" denotes the celestial-spiritual. In the Word the land of Canaan also (by which the Lord's kingdom is represented and signified) is called a "land flowing with milk and 
honey" (as in Num. 13:27; 14:8; Deut. 26:9, 15; 27:3; Jer. 11:5; 32:22; Ezek. 20:6, 15), and in these passages nothing else is meant by "milk" than an abundance of celestial-spiritual things, and by 
"honey" an abundance of the derivative happinesses; the "land" is the celestial itself of the kingdom, from which those things come. [7] As regards the "son of an ox," it was shown just above that 
thereby is signified the celestial natural (n. 2180), the celestial natural being the same as natural good, or good in the natural. The natural of man, like his rational, has its good and its truth; for 
there is everywhere the marriage of good and truth (as said above, n. 2173). The good of the natural is the delight which is perceived from charity, or from the friendship which is of charity; from 
which delight there comes forth a pleasure which is properly of the body. The truth of the natural is the memory-knowledge [scientificum] which favors that delight. Hence it is evident what the celestial 
natural is. </p>

<p align="center"><b>Elliott(1983-1999) 2184</b></p><p><b>2184.</b>
That 'butter' is the celestial part of the rational, 'milk' the spiritual deriving from this, and 'the young bull' the corresponding natural part, is clear from the meaning of 'butter', and of 'milk', 
and also of 'a young bull'. As regards 'butter', this in the Word means that which is celestial, and this because of the fat present in butter; for 'fat' means that which is celestial, as shown in Volume 
One, in <a href="353.htm">353</a>, and 'oil', being fat, means the celestial itself, in <a href="886.htm">886</a>. That 'butter' has the same meaning becomes clear in Isaiah, </p>
<blockquote>
Behold, a virgin is bearing a son, and will call His name Immanuel. 
Butter and honey will he eat that he may know to refuse the evil and choose the good. <a href="http://bible.gospelcom.net/cgi-bin/bible?passage=Isa%207:%2014,%2015&amp;version=ESV&amp;interface=print&amp;showfn=yes&amp;showxref">Isa 7: 14, 15</a>. 
</blockquote>
<p>This refers to the Lord, who is Immanuel; and anyone may see that butter is not meant by 
'butter', nor honey by 'honey'. But by 'butter' is meant His celestial, and by 'honey' that which is derived from that celestial. </p>
<p></p>
<p><b>[2]</b>
 In the same chapter, </p>
<blockquote>
And it will be, because of the abundance 
of milk which they give, that he will eat butter, for butter and honey will everyone eat that is left in the midst of the land. <a href="http://bible.gospelcom.net/cgi-bin/bible?passage=Isa%207:%2022&amp;version=ESV&amp;interface=print&amp;showfn=yes&amp;showxref">Isa 7: 22</a>. 
</blockquote>
<p>This refers to the Lord's kingdom, and to those on earth 
who are members of the Lord's kingdom. 'Milk' here stands for spiritual good, 'butter' for celestial good, and 'honey' for the happiness derived from this. </p>
<p></p>
<p><b>[3]</b>
 In Moses, </p>
<blockquote>
Jehovah alone leads 
him, and there is no foreign god with him. He causes him to ride on the heights of the land, and He feeds [him] with the produce of the fields, and He causes him to suck honey out of the rock and oil 
out of the flinty rock - butter from the herd, and milk from the flock, with the fat of lambs and of rams, the breed<A name="fntext1"></a><A href="#fn1"><sup>a</sup></a> of Bashan, and of goats, with the kidney-fat of wheat; and of the blood of the grape 
you will drink unmixed wine. <a href="http://bible.gospelcom.net/cgi-bin/bible?passage=Deut%2032:%2012-14&amp;version=ESV&amp;interface=print&amp;showfn=yes&amp;showxref">Deut 32: 12-14</a>. 
</blockquote>
<p>No one is able to understand what all these things mean unless he knows the internal sense of each one. It seems like a pile of expressions such as 
belong to the oratory employed by the wise men of the world. But yet each expression means that which is celestial and that which is spiritual going with it, and also the blessing and happiness which 
flow from these, and all of them in a co-ordinated sequence. 'Butter from the herd' is the celestial-natural, 'milk from the flock' the celestial-spiritual of the rational. </p>
<p></p>
<p><b>[4]</b>
 As regards 'milk' however, 
this means, as has been stated, that which is spiritual derived from that which is celestial, that is, the celestial-spiritual. What the celestial-spiritual is, see Volume One, in <a href="1577.htm">1577</a>, <a href="1824.htm">1824</a>, and 
in various other places. The reason 'milk' means that which is spiritual derived from that which is celestial is that 'water' means that which is spiritual, <a href="680.htm">680</a>, <a href="739.htm">739</a>, while milk, because of the fat 
in it, means the celestial-spiritual; or (what amounts to the same) truth rooted in good; or (also amounting to the same) faith grounded in love or charity; or (yet the same) the understanding part of 
the good present in the will; or (likewise amounting to the same) the affection for truth that has the affection for good within it; or (still yet the same) the affection for cognitions and facts that 
springs from the affection that belongs to charity towards the neighbour, such as exists with those who love the neighbour and confirm themselves in this love from the cognitions of faith and also 
from factual knowledge, which they love because they love the neighbour. All these are the same as the celestial-spiritual, and may be used in reference to any particular matter under discussion. </p>
<p></p>
<p><b>[5]</b>
That the celestial-spiritual is meant is also evident from the Word, as in Isaiah, </p>
<blockquote>
Everyone who thirsts, come to the waters, and he who has no money, come, buy, and eat! Come, buy wine and milk 
without money and without price. Why do you spend money on that which is not bread? <a href="http://bible.gospelcom.net/cgi-bin/bible?passage=Isa%2055:%201,%202&amp;version=ESV&amp;interface=print&amp;showfn=yes&amp;showxref">Isa 55: 1, 2</a>. 
</blockquote>
<p>Here 'wine' stands for the spiritual element of faith, 'milk' for the spiritual element of love. In 
Moses, </p>
<blockquote>
He washes his garment in wine and his vesture in the blood of grapes. His eyes are redder than wine, and his teeth are whiter than milk. <a href="http://bible.gospelcom.net/cgi-bin/bible?passage=Gen%2049:%2011,%2012&amp;version=ESV&amp;interface=print&amp;showfn=yes&amp;showxref">Gen 49: 11, 12</a>. 
</blockquote>
<p>This is the prophecy of Jacob, 
who by now was Israel, regarding Judah - 'Judah' being used here to describe the Lord. By 'teeth whiter than milk' is meant the celestial-spiritual which belonged to His Natural. </p>
<p></p>
<p><b>[6]</b>
 In Joel, </p>
<blockquote>
It 
will be, on that day, that the mountains will drip new wine, and the hills will run with milk, and all the streams of Judah will run with water. <a href="http://bible.gospelcom.net/cgi-bin/bible?passage=Joel%203:-18&amp;version=ESV&amp;interface=print&amp;showfn=yes&amp;showxref">Joel 3:-18</a>. 
</blockquote>
<p>Here, where the subject is the Lord's kingdom, 
'milk' stands for the celestial-spiritual. Also in the Word the land of Canaan, which represents and means the Lord's kingdom, is called 'a land flowing with milk and honey', as in <a href="http://bible.gospelcom.net/cgi-bin/bible?passage=Num%2013:%2027;%2014:%208&amp;version=ESV&amp;interface=print&amp;showfn=yes&amp;showxref">Num 13: 27; 14: 8</a>; <a href="http://bible.gospelcom.net/cgi-bin/bible?passage=Deut%2026:%209,%2015;%2027:%203&amp;version=ESV&amp;interface=print&amp;showfn=yes&amp;showxref">Deut 26: 9, 15; 27: 3</a>; <a href="http://bible.gospelcom.net/cgi-bin/bible?passage=Jer%2011:%205;%2032:%2022&amp;version=ESV&amp;interface=print&amp;showfn=yes&amp;showxref">Jer 11: 5; 32: 22</a>; <a href="http://bible.gospelcom.net/cgi-bin/bible?passage=Ezek%2020:%206,%2015&amp;version=ESV&amp;interface=print&amp;showfn=yes&amp;showxref">Ezek 20: 6, 15</a>. In these places nothing else is meant by 'milk' than the abundance of celestial-spiritual things, and by 'honey' the abundant happiness 
derived from these. 'Land' is the celestial part itself of the kingdom from which they come. </p>
<p></p>
<p><b>[7]</b>
 As regards 'a young bull' meaning the celestial-natural, this has been shown just above in <a href="2180.htm">2180</a>. 
The celestial-natural is the same as natural good, that is, good within the natural. Man's natural, like his rational, has its own good and its own truth, for then a marriage of good and truth exists 
everywhere, as stated above in <a href="2173.htm">2173</a>. The good that belongs to the natural is the delight which is perceived from charity, that is, from the friendship that is the product of charity; and from that 
delight springs the joy or satisfaction which belongs properly to the body. The truth of the natural consists in that factual knowledge which gives support to that delight. All this shows what the celestial- 
natural is.

Quod `butyrum' sit caeleste rationalis, quod `lac' sit spirituale inde, et quod `filius bovis' sit naturale correspondens, constat a significatione `butyri,' et a significatione `lactis,' tum a significatione 
`filii bovis'; quod `butyrum' attinet, illud in Verbo significat caeleste, et hoc ex pinguedine; quod `pingue' sit caeleste, in Parte Prima n.' 353 ostensum est; et quod `oleum,' quia pingue, 
sit ipsum caeleste, n. 886; quod etiam `butyrum,' constare potest apud Esaiam, 	Ecce virgo pariens filium, et vocabit nomen ejus Immanuel, butyrum et mel comedet, ad sciendum ipsum reprobare malum 
et eligere bonum, vii 14, 15; </p>
<p>ubi agitur de Domino, Qui est Immanuel; et quod per `butyrum' non significetur butyrum, nec mel per `mel,' quisque videre potest; sed per `butyrum' significatur caeleste 
Ipsius, et per `mel' illud quod ex caelesti: [2] apud eundem, 	Et erit prae multitudine faciendi lac, comedet butyrum, nam butyrum et mel comedet omnis residuus in medio terrae, vii 22; </p>
<p>ubi de regno 
Domini, et de illis qui in terris (o)qui in regno Domini sunt; `lac' ibi pro bono spirituali, `butyrum' pro bono caelesti, et `mel' pro felici inde: [3] apud Mosen, 	Jehovah solus ducit eum, et non 
cum illo deus alienus, equitare facit illum super excelsis terrae, et cibat proventibus agrorum, et sugere facit eum mel e petra, et oleum e silice rupis: butyrum armenti, et lac gregis, cum adipe agnorum, 
et arietum filiorum Bashanis, et hircorum, cum adipe renum tritici, et sanguinem uvae bibes merum, Deut. xxxii 12-14; </p>
<p>quid haec sunt, nemo intelligere potest nisi sciat sensum internum cujusvis; 
apparet sicut congeries expressionum, quales sunt eloquiorum apud sapientes mundi, sed usque unumquodvis significat caeleste et ejus spirituale, tum inde beatum et felix, et haec in concinna serie; 
`butyrum armenti' est caeleste naturale, `lac gregis' est caeleste spirituale rationalis.  [4] Quod autem `lac' attinet, ut dictum, hoc significat spirituale ex caelesti, seu caeleste spirituale; quid 
caeleste spirituale, videatur in Parte Prima n. 1577, 1824, et alibi passim; quod `lac' sit spirituale quod ex caelesti, inde est quia `aqua' significat spirituale, n. 680, 739; lac autem quia in illo 
pingue, caeleste spirituale {1}, seu quod idem, boni verum, aut quod idem, amoris seu charitatis fidem, aut {2} quod `etiam' idem, boni voluntatis intellectuale, (m)adhuc idem, affectionem veri in 
qua intus affectio boni, et adhuc (o)quod idem, affectionem cognitionum ac scientiarum ex affectione charitatis erga proximum, qualis est apud eos qui amant proximum et se confirmant in eo ex cognitionibus 
fidei, tum {3} ex scientificis, et haec inde amant(n); haec omnia eadem sunt ac caeleste spirituale, et praedicantur secundum rem de qua agitur: [5] quod illud significetur, patet etiam ex Verbo, 
ut apud Esaiam, 	Omnis sitiens, ite ad aquas, et cui non argentum, ite, emite, et comedite; et ite, emite absque argento, et sine pretio vinum et lac; cur appenditis argentum pro non pane? lv 1, 2; </p>
<p>ubi 
`vinum' pro spirituali quod est fidei, `lac' pro spirituali quod est amoris: apud Mosen, 	Lavit in vino vestimentum suum, et in sanguine uvarum operimentum suum: ruber oculis prae vino, et albus 
dentibus {4} prae lacte, Gen. xlix [11], 12; </p>
<p>ubi prophetia Jacobi, tunc Israelis, de Jehuda, et per `Jehudam' ibi describitur Dominus; et per `album dentibus {5} prae lacte' significatur caeleste 
spirituale quod Ipsius Naturali: [6] apud Joelem, 	Erit in die illo stillabunt montes mustum, et colles ibunt lacte; et omnes rivi Jehudae ibunt quis, iv 18; </p>
<p>ubi de regno Domini, et `lac' ibi pro caelesti 
spirituali.  In Verbo etiam terra Canaan, per quam repraesentatur et significatur regnum Domini, dicitur `terra lacte et melle fluens,' ut Num. xiii 27; xiv 8; Deut. xxvi 9, 15; xxvii 3; Jer. xi 
5; xxxii 22; Ezech. xx 6, 15; et ibi per `lac' nihil aliud intelligitur quam abundantia caelestium spiritualium, et per `mel' abundantia felicitatum inde; `terra' est ipsum caeleste regni, ex quo illa. 
 [7] Quod `filium bovis' concernit {6}, quod per (c)illum significetur caeleste naturale, mox supra n. 2180 ostensum; (m)caeleste naturale est idem ac bonum naturale, seu bonum in naturali; naturale 
hominis, sicut ejus rationale, habet suum bonum et suum verum, nam ubivis est conjugium boni et veri, ut supra n. 2173 dictum; bonum naturalis est jucundum quod percipitur ex charitate seu ex amicitia
