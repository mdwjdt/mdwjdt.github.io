<h3 align="center" class="ired">属天的奥秘 第8773节</h3>
<h4 align="center"></h4><p><strong>8773.</strong>“摩西去召了百姓的长老来”表选择那些在理解真理方面排在首位的人。这从“召到自己这里”和“百姓的长老”的含义清楚可知：“召到自己这里”是指选择；“百姓的长老”是指那些在理解真理方面排在首位的人，在从人抽象出来的意义上是指首要真理（参看<a href="6524.htm">6524</a>，<a href="6525.htm">6525</a>，<a href="6890.htm">6890</a>，<a href="8578.htm">8578</a>，<a href="8585.htm">8585</a>节）。此中情形是这样：那些处于本章所论述的良善，也就是尚未接受赋予它形式的真理的良善之人首先被通过首要真理，也就是总体真理而重新形成，这些首要真理包含其余的真理，并且是它们的源头。首要真理是这些：神是一，或说存在一位神；主出生为一个人，以便能拯救人类；天堂和地狱是存在的；过着良善生活的人上天堂，而过着邪恶生活的人则下地狱；爱主爱邻是其余诫命所依赖的诫命，这爱唯独通过信存在。这些和其它类似真理就是首要真理，主首先把这些真理灌输到与正在重生之人同在的良善中。当这些真理被灌输到良善中，变成良善之真理时，其余的真理就被灌输进来。它们在这些总体或首要真理里面和之下被依次排列，并与天堂所取的形式保持一致。它们就这样逐渐使天堂的生命存在于这个人里面，使他可以说成为一个微型天堂；也就是说，它们能使构成他理解力和意愿的一切都和天使的良善与真理联系在一起，从而使这一切与天使本人同在。</p>

And Moses came and called the elders of the people. That this signifies the choosing of those who were primarily in the intelligence of truth, is evident from the signification of "calling unto himself," 
as being a choosing; and from the signification of "the elders of the people," as being those who are primarily in the intelligence of truth, and in a sense abstracted from person, primary truths 
(see n. 6524, 6525, 6890, 8578, 8585). The case herein is this. They who are in good not yet formed by means of truths, which good is treated of in this chapter, are first formed by the Lord by means 
of primary truths, that is, by means of general truths, in which and from which are the rest. Primary truths are, that there is one God, that the Lord was born a man that He might save the human race, 
that there is a heaven and that there is a hell, that those come into heaven who have lived well and those into hell who have lived ill; also that love to God and love toward the neighbor are the commandments 
on which the rest hang, and that this love is impossible except through faith. These and the like are primary truths, and these are first insinuated by the Lord in the good with the man who 
is being regenerated. When these truths have been insinuated, and have become truths of good, then the rest are insinuated, and in these general or primary truths, and under them, they are set in order 
according to the heavenly form, and thus by degrees cause the life of heaven to be in that man, and cause him to be as it were a heaven in a small image; that is, cause all things which are of his 
understanding and of his will to be in consociation with the goods and truths of the angels, thus to be with the angels. </p>

'And Moses came and called the elders of the people' means the choice of those who ranked first in the understanding of truth. This is clear from the meaning of 'calling to oneself' as choosing; and 
from the meaning of 'the elders of the people' as those who rank first in the understanding of truth, or - in the sense completely separate from actual persons - leading truths, dealt with in <a href="6524.htm">6524</a>, <a href="6525.htm">6525</a>, <a href="6890.htm">6890</a>, <a href="8578.htm">8578</a>, <a href="8585.htm">8585</a> The implications of all this are as follows: People governed by the kind of good that is the subject in the present chapter - that is, good that has not as yet received truths to 
give it form - are reformed by the Lord first by means of leading truths, that is, by general truths, which contain and are the source of all other truths. Leading truths are these: God is one; the Lord 
was born a human being in order that the human race might be saved; heaven exists, and hell; those who have led a good life enter heaven, and those who have led a bad one enter hell; love to the Lord 
and love towards the neighbour are the commandments on which all others hang; and only through faith can this love exist. These and others like them are the leading truths which the Lord first instills 
into the good present with a person who is being regenerated When these truths have been instilled into the good and become the truths of good, all other truths are instilled. They are arranged into 
order within and beneath those general or leading truths, and are in keeping with the form that heaven takes. Thus by degrees they enable the life of heaven to exist in that person, who is then so 
to speak a miniature heaven; that is, they enable all that composes his understanding and that constitutes his will to be linked to the forms of good and the truths residing with angels, and so to the 
angels themselves. </p>

`Et venit Moscheh, et vocavit seniores populi': quod significet electionem illorum qui primario in intelligentia veri, constat ex significatione `vocare ad se' quod sit electio, et ex significatione 
`seniorum populi' quod sint qui primario in intelligentia veri sunt, et in sensu a persona abstracto, primaria vera, de qua n. (x)6524, 6525, 6890, (x)8578, 8585.  Cum his ita se habet: qui in bono sunt 
nondum formato per vera, de quo bono in hoc capite agitur, illi a Domino primum formantur per primaria vera, hoc est, per vera communia, in quibus et a quibus reliqua; primaria vera sunt, quod Deus 
unus sit, quod Dominus natus sit homo ut salvaret genus humanum, quod caelum sit et quod infernum, quod in caelum veniant qui bene vixerant et in infernum qui male, tum quod amor in Deum et amor erga 
proximum (t)sint praecepta a quibus pendent reliqua, et quod amor ille dari nequeat nisi per fidem; haec et similia sunt primaria vera quae a Domino primum insinuantur bono apud hominem qui regeneratur; 
haec vera, cum insinuata sunt et facta boni, tunc (x)reliqua insinuantur, (c)et in communibus illis seu primariis, ac sub illis ordinantur secundum formam caelestem, et sic per gradus faciunt ut 
in homine illo sit vita caeli, et {1}is quasi caelum in parva imagine, hoc est, ut omnia quae sunt intellectus et quae sunt voluntatis apud illum in consociatione sint cum bonis et veris apud angelos, 
ita cum angelis. 	@1 quasi sit$ </p>
