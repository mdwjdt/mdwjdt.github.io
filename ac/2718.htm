<h3 align="center" class="ired">属天的奥秘 第2718节</h3>
<h4 align="center"></h4><p><strong>2718.</strong>“出于埃及地的妻子”表对属灵教会成员所拥有的记忆知识的情感。这从“妻子”和“埃及”的含义清楚可知：“妻子”是指情感或良善（参看<a href="915.htm">915</a>，<a href="2517.htm">2517</a>节）；“埃及”是指记忆知识（参看<a href="1164.htm">1164</a>，<a href="1165.htm">1165</a>，<a href="1186.htm">1186</a>，<a href="1462.htm">1462</a>节）。本节描述了属灵教会成员的良善的性质，即其生命的本质。也就是说，他所具有的良善相对模糊，但这种模糊被主的神圣人性照亮。通过这种光照，对真理的情感在其心智的理性部分产生，对记忆知识的情感则在属世部分产生。对良善的情感无法象在属天之人里面那样在属灵之人里面产生，取而代之的是对真理的情感。其原因在于，属灵之人所具有的良善被植入在其心智的理解力部分，与属天之人的良善相比，相对模糊，如前所示（<a href="2715.htm">2715</a>节）。除了对真理的情感外，没有其它情感通过这良善在其理性部分产生并获得，对记忆知识的情感则在其属世部分产生并获得。此处的真理并非表示其它真理，而表示这人信以为真的真理，即便它本身并非真理。记忆知识也并非表示学者所拥有的那类记忆知识，而表示一个人通过经验、听闻、日常生活、教义、圣言所能吸收的一切事实性知识。属灵教会成员就具有对这类真理和知识的情感。<br />为叫人们了解何谓对真理的情感，何谓对良善的情感，下面对它们作以简要说明。那些具有对真理的情感之人思考、探究并讨论一件事是否是真的，或这事是否如此。当确信这事是真的，或就是如此时，他们又思考、探究并讨论这事到底是何情形。他们就这样在门槛处裹足不前，无法得以进入智慧，除非他们不再有任何怀疑。然而，那些具有对良善的情感之人则通过主导他们的良善本身知道并发觉事情就是如此。因此，他们不会停留在门槛处，而是进到屋子里面，因为他们已进入智慧。<br />举个例子：通过对良善的情感或良善思考和行事是一种属天的天赋。对此，那些具有真理的情感之人会推敲是不是这样，这种天赋有没有存在的可能，它到底是怎么回事。只要充满对它的质疑，他们就无法承认这一事实。但那些具有对良善的情感之人既不讨论，也不质疑，而是肯定这事是真的，并因此承认它。因为那些具有对良善的情感之人，即属天之人从那些具有对真理的情感之人，即属灵之人停顿的地方开始起行。所以，后者的最远点就是前者的起点。正因如此，那些属天之人得以知道、认识并发觉对良善的情感不计其数，事实上，和天上的社群一样多；它们全都被主联结成天堂的形式，以至于可以说组成一个人。他们还得以通过直觉区分每种情感所属的种类。<br />或举这个例子：一切快乐、幸福和愉悦唯独属于爱，并且爱的性质决定了快乐、幸福和愉悦的性质。属灵之人的心思会专注在以下问题上：这是不是真的，快乐、幸福和愉悦有没有可能来自其它源头，比如来自人际交往、交谈、冥想、学问，或财产、地位、名声和它们所带来的荣耀。只要提出这样的疑问，他就不会确认这一事实：这些东西没有任何效果，只有诸如存在于他们里面的爱之情感才能产生这种果效。然而，属天之人不会纠缠在这些初步质疑中，而是肯定事情就是如此。所以，他着眼于目的本身和功用，也就是说，他被无数爱之情感所主导，其中每一种情感里面都有无法形容的事物，包括快乐、幸福和愉悦的无穷变化。<br />再举一例：当因邻人所具有的良善而爱邻人。那些具有对真理的情感之人会思考、探究并讨论这是不是真的，即事情是否如此。他们会询问何为邻人，何为良善；也不往前走，因此自己关闭了那智慧之门。然而，那些具有对良善的情感之人则肯定事情就是如此，因而不会关闭智慧之门，而是进到里面，通过良善知道、认识并发觉，谁比别人更是邻人，他在何等程度上成为邻人，以及所有人都是不同程度的邻人。因此，他们能觉察到无法形容的事物，这些事物远远超出那些只有对真理的情感之人的认知。<br />另举一例：凡因邻人所具有的良善而爱邻人者，皆爱主。那些具有对真理的情感之人会仔细探究这事是否如此；若被告知，凡因邻人所具有的良善而爱邻人者皆爱良善（因为一切良善皆来自主，主就存在于良善中），并且凡爱良善者也爱那良善从祂而出、祂在这良善中的主，那么他们也会探究这事是否如此。他们还会问何为热爱良善，以及何为良善，主是不是在良善中比在真理中多一点。只要纠缠在这类问题上，他们甚至无法远远地瞥见智慧的一隅。但那些具有对良善的情感之人则通过直理解力道事情就是如此，并立刻窥见智慧的全貌，甚至一直通到主那里。<br />综上所述，我们可以看出为何与那些具有对良善的情感之人，即属天之人相比，那些具有对真理的情感之人，即属灵之人存在模糊。尽管如此，属灵之人仍能从模糊进入光明，只要他们愿意采取肯定的态度，即肯定：一切良善皆属于对主之爱和对邻之仁；爱与仁构成属灵的结合；这些就是一切幸福快乐的源头；因此，天堂的生命就在于从主而来的爱之良善，而不在于脱离它的信之真理。</p>

<p align="center"><b>Potts(1905-1910) 2718</b></p><p><b>2718.</b>
A wife out of the land of Egypt. That this signifies the affection of memory-knowledges belonging to the man of the spiritual church is evident from the signification of a "wife," as being affection 
or good (see n. 915, 2517); and from the signification of "Egypt" as being memory-knowledge (see n. 1164, 1165, 1186, 1462). In this verse the man of the spiritual church is described in regard to his 
quality as to good, that is, as to the essence of his life, namely, that the good that is with him is obscure, but is illuminated by the Lord's Divine Human; from which illumination there comes forth 
in his rational the affection of truth, and in his natural the affection of memory-knowledges. The reason why the affection of good cannot come forth with the spiritual man such as it is with the celestial, 
but in place of it the affection of truth, is that the good which is in him is implanted in his intellectual part and is comparatively obscure (as was shown, n. 2715), from which no other affection 
can be produced and derived in his rational than the affection of truth, and thereby in his natural the affection of memory-knowledges. By truth here no other truth is meant than such as he believes 
to be true, though it be not true in itself; and by memory-knowledges are not meant such as the learned have, but everything of knowledge with which one can be imbued from experience and by hearing, 
from civic life, from doctrine, and from the Word. The man of the spiritual church is in the affection of such things. [2] That it may be known what it is to be in the affection of truth, and what 
to be in the affection of good, we will briefly state that they who are in the affection of truth, think, search out, and discuss whether a thing be true, or whether it be so; and when they are confirmed 
that it is true, or that it is so, they think, search out, and discuss what it is, and thus stick fast at the first threshold; nor can they be admitted into wisdom until they are free from doubt. 
But they who are in the affection of good, from the good itself in which they are, know and perceive that the thing is so; and thus are not at the first threshold, but are in the inner chamber, being 
admitted into wisdom. [3] Take as an example that it is celestial to think and act from the affection of good, or from good: They who are in the affection of truth discuss whether this be so, whether 
it be possible, and what it is; and so long as they are occupied with doubts about it they cannot be admitted; but they who are in the affection of good do not discuss, nor busy themselves with doubts, 
but affirm that it is so, and are therefore admitted; for they who are in the affection of good, that is, who are celestial, begin where they who are in the affection of truth, that is, who are spiritual, 
stop; so that the furthest boundary of the latter is the first of the former. For this reason it is given to them to know, to recognize, and to perceive that there are innumerable affections 
of good (as many, in fact, as there are societies in heaven); and that they are all conjoined by the Lord into a heavenly form, so as to constitute as it were one man; and it is also given them to distinguish 
by perception the kind and variety of each affection. [4] Or take this example: That all delight, blessedness, and happiness, are solely of love; and that such as the love is, such is the delight, 
the blessedness, and the happiness. The spiritual man keeps his natural mind fixed on the question whether it be so, and whether the happiness be not from some other source, as from social interaction, 
conversation, meditation, and learning, or from possessions and the honor, reputation, and glory of them; not confirming himself in the fact that these effect nothing, but only the affection 
of love such as there is in them. But the celestial man does not stick in these preliminaries, but affirms that it is so, and is therefore in the end itself and the use, that is, in the very affections 
of the love, which are innumerable, and in every one of which there are ineffable things-and this with variation of delight, blessedness, and happiness, to eternity. [5] Take also as an example that 
the neighbor is to be loved for the good that is in him: They who are in the affection of truth, think, search out, and discuss whether this be true, or whether it be so; what the neighbor is, and 
what good is; nor do they go any further, and therefore they close to themselves the gate to wisdom; but they who are in the affection of good affirm that it is so, and therefore do not close that gate 
to themselves, but enter in, and know, and recognize, and perceive, from good, who is more the neighbor than another, also in what degree he is the neighbor, and that all are neighbors in different 
degrees; and thus they perceive ineffable things beyond those who are only in the affection of truth. [6] Take further this example: That he who loves his neighbor for the good that is in him, loves 
the Lord. They who are in the affection of truth examine carefully whether it be so; and if they are told that he who loves his neighbor for the good that is in him, loves the good, and that-as all good 
is from the Lord and the Lord is in the good-when anyone loves good he also loves Him from whom it is and in which He is, they examine whether it be so; also what good is, and whether the Lord is in 
good more than in truth; and so long as they stick in such things they cannot see wisdom even at a distance. But they who are in the affection of good know from perception that it is so; and they immediately 
see the field of wisdom, leading even to the Lord. [7] From all this we can see why they who are in the affection of truth (that is, the spiritual) have obscurity in comparison with those who 
are in the affection of good (that is, the celestial). Nevertheless the spiritual can come from obscurity into light, provided they are willing to be in the affirmative that all good is of love to 
the Lord and of charity toward the neighbor; and that love and charity are spiritual conjunction; and that all blessedness and happiness are from these; and thus that heavenly life is in the good of love 
from the Lord, but not in the truth of faith separate from it. </p>

<p align="center"><b>Elliott(1983-1999) 2718</b></p><p><b>2718.</b>
'A wife from the land of Egypt' means the affection for knowledge, which the member of the spiritual Church possesses. This is clear from the meaning of 'a wife' as affection or good, dealt with in <a href="915.htm">915</a>, <a href="2517.htm">2517</a>, and from the meaning of 'Egypt' as knowledge, dealt with in <a href="1164.htm">1164</a>, <a href="1165.htm">1165</a>, <a href="1186.htm">1186</a>, <a href="1462.htm">1462</a>. In this verse the member of the spiritual Church is described so far as the nature of his good, that is, the 
essence of his life, is concerned - that the good residing with him is obscure, but that it is brightened with light from the Lord's Divine Human. From that brightening of it the affection for truth 
arises in the rational part of his mind, and the affection for knowledge in the natural part. The reason the affection for good such as resides within the celestial man cannot arise in the spiritual 
man, but instead the affection for truth, is that the good residing with him is implanted in the understanding part of his mind, and is obscure compared with the celestial man's good, as shown in <a href="2715.htm">2715</a>. 
From this good no other type of affection can be generated and derived within his rational than the affection for truth, and through this affection for truth the affection for knowledge within the 
natural. No other truth is meant in this case than that which the person believes to be the truth, even though it may not in itself be the truth. Nor is knowledge used to mean such knowledge as the learned 
possess but all factual knowledge with which a person can be taught from what he experiences or hears in everyday life, from doctrine, and from the Word. It is the affection for such truth and knowledge 
that exists within the member of the spiritual Church. </p>
<p></p>
<p><b>[2]</b>
 So that it may be known what is meant by the affection for truth existing with someone and what by the affection for good, let a 
brief statement be made regarding them. Those with the affection for truth think about, question, and discuss whether a thing is true, whether it is so. And when they are convinced it is true, or is so, 
they think about, question, and discuss what it is. Thus they remain rooted on the doorstep and cannot be admitted into wisdom until they no longer have any doubts. Those however with whom the affection 
for good exists know and perceive that the thing is so from the good itself governing them. Thus they do not remain on the doorstep but are in a room inside, having been admitted into wisdom. </p>
<p></p>
<p><b>[3]</b>
Take as an example the consideration that it is a celestial gift to think and to act from an affection for good, or from good. Those with whom the affection for truth exists discuss whether this 
is so, whether such a gift can exist, and what it may be. And so long as they are turning over doubts about it they are unable to be admitted. But those with the affection for good do not discuss or turn 
doubts over but assert that the thing is true and are for that reason admitted. For those with whom the affection for good exists, that is, those who are celestial, start off where those with the 
affection for truth, that is, those who are spiritual, come to a halt, so that the furthest point reached by the latter is the starting point for the former. That being so, those who are celestial are 
given to know, recognize, and perceive that affections for good are countless - as numerous as the communities in heaven - and that they are all joined together by the Lord into a heavenly form so as 
to constitute one human being so to speak. They are also given to define by perception the genus and species to which each affection belongs. </p>
<p></p>
<p><b>[4]</b>
 Or take this example: All delight, blessedness, and 
happiness belong wholly to love, but the nature of the love determines that of the delight, blessedness, and happiness. The spiritual man fixes his mind on the question whether this is true and whether 
delight, blessedness, and happiness may not spring from some other source, such as from mixing with others, talking to others, meditation, or learning, and also whether they reside in possessions, 
position, reputation, and the glory resulting from these. As long as he is asking such questions he does not confirm himself in the truth that none of these accomplishes anything, only the affection 
born of love which is present within them and making them what they are. The celestial man however does not remain rooted in such preliminary questionings but immediately asserts that the thing is true. 
Consequently he is interested in the end in view and the realization of this, that is, he is governed by the very affections born of love which are countless, and in each one of which there are things 
beyond description, involving variations of delight, blessedness, and happiness that have no end. </p>
<p></p>
<p><b>[5]</b>
 Take as a further example the consideration that the neighbour is to be loved for the good 
that resides with him. Those with whom the affection for truth exists think, question, and discuss whether this is true, that is, whether it is so. They ask what the neighbour is, what good is; but they 
go no further than this, and therefore they shut the door to wisdom against themselves. Those however with the affection for good assert that the thing is so and do not consequently shut the door against 
themselves but enter in and so come to know, recognize, and perceive from good who is pre-eminently the neighbour, also in what degree he is the neighbour, and that everyone in differing ways is 
the neighbour. Thus they perceive things beyond description, over and above what is known to those with the affection solely for truth. </p>
<p></p>
<p><b>[6]</b>
 Take as yet another example the truth that a person who 
loves the neighbour for the good within him loves the Lord. Those with the affection for truth question whether this is so. And if they are told that anyone who loves the neighbour for the good within 
him loves the good, and that - since all good comes from the Lord and the Lord is present in good - when anyone loves good he also loves the Lord from whom that good comes and in which He is present, 
they then question whether that too is so. They also ask what loving good is, as well as what good is, and whether the Lord is present more so in good than in truth. As long as they remain rooted in 
such questionings they cannot get even a distant view of wisdom. But those with the affection for good know from perception that the thing is so and immediately behold the whole field of wisdom leading 
right on to the Lord. </p>
<p></p>
<p><b>[7]</b>
 From these examples it may become clear why in comparison with those who have the affection for good, that is, with those who are celestial, obscurity exists with those 
who have the affection for truth, that is, with those who are spiritual Nevertheless the latter are able to pass from obscurity into light, provided that they are willing to adopt the affirmative attitude 
that all good belongs to love to the Lord and charity towards the neighbour; also that love and charity constitute spiritual conjunction, and that these are the source of all blessedness and happiness, 
thus that heavenly life consists in the good belonging to love received from the Lord, but not in the truth of faith separated from it. </p>

`Uxorem e terra Aegypti': quod significet affectionem scientiarum quae spiritualis Ecclesiae homini, constat ex significatione `uxoris' quod sit affectio seu bonum, de qua D. 915, 2517, et ex significatione 
`Aegypti' quod sit scientia, de qua n. 1164, 1165, 1186, 1462.  In hoc versu describitur spiritualis Ecclesiae homo qualis est quoad bonum, hoc est, quoad essentiam vitae suae, quod nempe bonum 
apud illum' sit obscurum, sed quod illuminatum a Divino Humano Domini, ex qua illuminatione existit in ejus rationali affectio veri, et in ejus naturali affectio scientiarum: quod apud spiritualem 
hominem affectio boni qualis est apud caelestem, existere nequeat, sed loco ejus affectio veri, causa est quia bonum apud illum implantatum est in parte ejus intellectuali, et quod obscurum sit respective, 
ut n. 2715 ostensum est {1}, inde produci et derivari in rationale ejus non alia affectio potest quam affectio veri, et per hanc in naturale affectio scientiarum: per verum non aliud verum intelligitur 
quam tale quod credit esse verum, tametsi non esset verum in se; et per scientias non intelliguntur scientiae quales sunt eruditis, sed omne scientificum quo ab experientia et per auditionem imbui 
possit ex vita civili, ex doctrina, et ex Verbo; in talium affectione est spiritualis Ecclesiae homo.  [2] Ut sciatur quid sit in affectione veri esse, et quid in affectione boni, paucis dicendum; 
qui in affectione veri sunt, cogitant, disquirunt, et disserunt, num hoc verum `sit', num ita sit, et cum confirmantur quod verum sit, seu quod ita sit, cogitant, disquirunt, et disserunt, quid sit; 
ita haerent in primo limine, nec admitti possunt in sapientiam antequam absque dubio sunt; qui autem in affectione boni sunt, ex ipso bono in quo sunt, norunt et percipiunt quod ita sit, ita non in primo 
limine sunt, sed in conclavi, admissi in sapientiam: [3] sit pro exemplo quod caeleste sit cogitare et agere ex affectione boni aut ex bono; qui in affectione veri sunt, disserunt num ita sit, num 
dabile sit, et quid sit, et quamdiu dubia versant de eo, non possunt intromitti; qui autem in affectione boni sunt, ii non disserunt, nec dubia versant, sed aiunt quod ita sit, quare intromittuntur, 
incohant enim ibi qui in affectione boni sunt, hoc est, caelestes, ubi subsistunt illi qui in affectione veri (o)sunt, hoc est, spirituales, sic ut ultimus horum terminus sit primus illorum; ideo scire, 
nosse, et percipere illis datur quod affectiones boni sint innumerabiles, quot nempe societates sunt in caelo, et quod omnes a Domino in formam caelestem conjunctae sint, ut unum quasi hominem constituant; 
tum etiam cujusvis affectionis genus et speciem perceptione dignoscere datur.  [4] {2} Vel sit hoc exemplum ita; quod omne jucundum, beatum et felix, unice sit amoris, sed qualis amor, tale 
jucundum, beatum et felix: spiritualis homo detinet animum in eo num ita sit, et annon aliunde, ut ex conversatione, sermone, meditatione, eruditione, etiam annon in possessione, honore, fama, gloria 
inde, non se confirmans in eo quod illa nihil faciant, sed affectio amoris quae et qualis in illis; caelestis autem homo non in praeliminaribus illis haeret, sed ait quod ita sit, quare in ipso fine est, 
et usu, hoc est, in ipsis affectionibus quae sunt amoris, quae innumerabiles sunt, et in quarum unaquaevis ineffabilia, et hoc cum variatione jucundi, beati, et felicis, in aeternum.  [5]	Sit etiam 
pro exemplo quod proximus amandus ex bono quod apud illum; qui in affectione veri sunt, cogitant, disquirunt, et disserunt, num hoc verum sit seu num ita sit, quid proximus, quid bonum, nec ulterius 
vadunt, quare praecludunt sibi januam ad sapientiam; qui autem in affectione boni sunt, aiunt quod ita sit, quare non praecludunt sibi januam, sed intrant, ac sciunt, norunt, et percipiunt ex bono, quis 
proximus prae alio, etiam in quo gradu sit, et quod omnes in dissimili, ita ineffabilia prae illis qui in sola affectione veri.  [6] Porro sit pro exemplo quod qui proximum ex bono amat, Dominum amet; 
qui in affectione veri sunt, disquirunt num ita sit, et si iis dicitur, qui proximum amat ex bono, is bonum amat, et quia omne bonum a Domino, et in bono est Dominus, quando quis bonum, etiam Ipsum 
ex quo illud et in quo Ipse, amat; etiam disquirunt num ita sit, [tum quid sit amare bonum,] etiam quid bonum, num Dominus in bono sit magis quam in vero; quamdiu in talibus haerent, ne quidem e longinquo 
videre possunt sapientiam; at qui in affectione boni sunt, ii ex perceptione norunt quod ita sit, et statim {3} vident sapientiae campum, ducentem usque ad Dominum. [7] Inde constare potest unde 
obscurum illis qui in affectione veri sunt, hoc est, spiritualibus, respective ad illos qui in affectione boni, hoc est, ad caelestes: sed usque illi ab obscuro in lucem venire possunt, si modo in 
affirmativo velint esse quod omne bonum sit amoris in Dominum et charitatis erga proximum, et quod amor et charitas sit conjunctio spiritualis, et inde omne beatum et felix; ita quod in bono amoris a 
Domino sit vita caelestis, non autem in vero fidei inde separato. 	@1 bonum apud illum est obscurum respective, et quia implantatum est in parte ejus intellectuali, ut ostensum n. 2715.$ 	@2 In A this
