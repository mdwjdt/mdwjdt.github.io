<h3 align="center" class="ired">属天的奥秘 第2118节</h3>
<h4 align="center"></h4><p><strong>2118.</strong>最后的审判是指一个教会的末世，以及每个人生命的最终状态。关于教会的末世：对大洪水前上古教会的最后审判发生在他们的后代灭亡之时，他们的毁灭被描述为大洪水；对大洪水后古教会的最后审判发生在该教会所有人几乎都成了偶像崇拜者，并被分散之时；对随后雅各后代中的代表性教会的最后审判，则发生在十个支派被掳去、分散在列国中，并且后来，主降世后，犹太人被逐出迦南地，分散到世界各地之时；对当代教会，也就是所谓基督教会的最后审判，就是约翰启示录中“新天和新地”所表示的。</p>

By the Last Judgment is meant the last time of a church, and also the last state of each person's life. As regards the last time of the church, it was the Last Judgment of the Most Ancient Church, which 
was before the flood, when their posterity perished; whose destruction is described by the flood The Last Judgment of the Ancient Church, which was after the flood, was when almost all who were of 
that church became idolaters, and were dispersed. The Last Judgment of the Representative Church, which succeeded among the posterity of Jacob, was when the ten tribes were carried away into captivity, 
and were dispersed among the nations; and when later, after the Lord's coming, the Jews were driven out of the land of Canaan, and were scattered throughout the world. The Last Judgment of the present 
church, which is called the Christian Church, is what is meant by John in Revelation by the "New Heaven and the New Earth." </p>

The expression 'Last Judgement' is used to mean the final period of a Church, and also to mean the final phase of each person's life. As regards the final period of a Church, the Last Judgement of the 
Most Ancient Church, which had existed before the Flood, occurred when their descendants perished, whose destruction is described by the Flood. The Last Judgement of the Ancient Church, which existed 
after the Flood, took place when almost all who belonged to that Church had become idolaters and had been scattered. The Last Judgement of the representative Church, which followed next, among the descendants 
of Jacob, came about when the ten tribes were led away into captivity and dispersed among the gentile nations; and later on when the Jews after the Lord's Coming were expelled from the land 
of Canaan and were scattered throughout the whole world. The Last Judgement of the Church existing at present, which is called the Christian Church, is what 'the new heaven and the new earth' is used 
to mean in John in the Book of Revelation. </p>

Per `Ultimum Judicium' intelligitur ultimum tempus Ecclesiae, tum ultimum vitae cujusvis: quod `ultimum tempus Ecclesiae' attinet, fuit ultimum judicium Ecclesiae Antiquissimae quae fuerat ante diluvium, 
quando posteritas eorum periit, cujus interitus describitur per diluvium. Ultimum judicium Ecclesiae Antiquae quae post diluvium, fuit cum paene omnes qui fuerunt ab illa Ecclesia, facti sunt idololatrae, 
ac dispersi.  Ultimum judicium Ecclesiae repraesentativae quae apud Jacobi posteros successit, fuit cum decem tribus in captivitatem abductae (o)et inter gentes dissipatae sunt, et dein Judaei 
post Adventum Domini, expulsi terra Canaane (o)et in universum orbem dispersi.  Ultimum judicium hujus Ecclesiae quae Ecclesia Christiana vocatur, est quod apud Johannem in Apocalypsi, per `novum 
caelum et novam terram intelligitur. </p>
