<h3 align="center" class="ired">属天的奥秘 第1752节</h3>
<h4 align="center"></h4><p><strong>1752.</strong>“只有少年人所吃的”表善灵。这从上下文清楚可知。从上文（13节）来看，所提及的亚乃、以实各和幔利是指与亚伯兰结盟的，他们表示就主的外在人而言，祂的理性人在其良善与真理方面的状态，因而表示主在争战时与祂同在的天使，这从那里所给出的解读明显可知。这从下文同样清楚看出来。那些伴随亚伯兰的人在此被称为“少年人”或“孩子”，他们无非是指善灵。但紧接着所提及的“人”是指天使。当主与地狱争战时，天使与主同在。这一点从圣言和以下事实清楚可知：当主处于试探的争战时，天使必定在场，主通过自己的权柄赋予他们力量和看似与祂一起争战的能力，因为天使所具有的一切能力皆源于主。<br />天使与恶者争战，这从前面各处有关与人同在的天使的论述清楚可知。如他们如何保护世人，抵挡地狱灵借以攻击他的邪恶（参看<a href="50.htm">50</a>，<a href="227.htm">227</a>，<a href="228.htm">228</a>，<a href="697.htm">697</a>，<a href="968.htm">968</a>节）。然而，他们所具有的一切能力皆源于主。事实上，善灵也是天使，只是相对低级。因为他们在第一层天，而天使灵在第二层天，严格意义上的所谓天使则在第三层天（参看<a href="459.htm">459</a>，<a href="684.htm">684</a>节）。来世的管理形式是这样：善灵从属于天使灵，天使灵从属于真正的天使，他们由此构成一个天使社群。善灵和天使灵就是此处那些被称为“少年人”的人，而真正的天使则被称为“人”。</p>

<p><strong>[NCE]1752.</strong> The symbolism of excepting only what the young men have eaten as good spirits can be seen from what comes before and after. As for what comes before, Mamre, Eshcol, and Aner are mentioned above at verse <a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_1752/bible_king-james-version_genesis_14_13" target=_top>13</a> as sworn allies of Abram's. They symbolized the state of the Lord's rational self, or at least its outward part, and what its goodness and truth were like [<a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_1752/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_1705" target=_top>1705</a>]. Consequently they symbolized the angels who were with the Lord when he was fighting, as is evident from the explanation there.<br />The same thing can be seen from what follows, as will soon become clear.<br />Here the ones who went with Abram are called young men; what they actually mean are good spirits; fully adult men, discussed just below, mean angels.<br />The Word reveals that angels were present with the Lord when he fought the hells.{*1} The same thing can be deduced from the fact that angels simply had to be present during his struggles, to whom the Lord (by his own power) gave strength and the apparent ability to fight alongside him. Angels receive all their power from the Lord.<br />[2] The fact that angels fight evil spirits can be seen from many earlier remarks about the angels present with us, guarding us and turning aside the harm that hellish spirits attempt, as discussed above at <a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_1752/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_50" target=_top>50</a>, <a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_1752/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_227" target=_top>227</a>, <a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_1752/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_228" target=_top>228</a>, <a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_1752/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_697" target=_top>697</a>, <a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_1752/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_968" target=_top>968</a>. All their power is from the Lord, though.<br />It is true that good spirits are angels too, but they are a lower kind, because they inhabit the first heaven. Angelic spirits inhabit the second, and those who are properly called angels inhabit the third, as mentioned in <a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_1752/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_459" target=_top>459</a>, <a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_1752/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_684" target=_top>684</a>. The form of government in the other world is such that good spirits are subordinate to angelic spirits, and angelic spirits are subordinate to actual angels. As a result, they form a single angelic community.<br />Good spirits and angelic spirits are the ones called young men here, but actual angels are the ones called men.<br /><br /><strong>Footnotes:</strong><br />{*1} Swedenborg here may have in mind the help from angels that Jesus received after he was tempted by the Devil (<a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_1752/bible_king-james-version_matthew_4_11" target=_top>Matthew 4:11</a>) and during his agony in the Garden of Gethsemane (<a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_1752/bible_king-james-version_luke_22_43" target=_top>Luke 22:43</a>).

Save only that which the lads have eaten. That this signifies the good spirits, is evident from what precedes, and from what follows. It is evident from what precedes, for Mamre, Eshcol, and Aner are 
mentioned above (verse 13) as being allies of the covenant of Abram, by whom was signified the state of the Lord's rational man as to His external man, in respect to the quality of its goods and truths; 
and thus it is evident that by them were signified the angels who were with the Lord when He was combating, as is plain from the explication there given. The same is evident from what follows, as 
will presently appear. Those who went with Abram are here called "the lads" or "children," by whom no others are meant than good spirits; but by "the men," who are spoken of immediately afterwards, are 
meant angels. That there were angels with the Lord when He fought against the hells, is evident from the Word; as also from the consideration that when He was in the combats of temptations, it could 
not be otherwise than that angels should be present, to whom the Lord from His own power gave strength, and as it were power, to fight together with Him, for all the power that the angels have is from 
the Lord.  [2] That angels fight against the evil, may be seen from what has occasionally been said before concerning the angels with man-that they protect man, and avert the evils which are threatened 
by infernal spirits (see above, n. 50, 227, 228, 697, 968) but all their power is from the Lord. The good spirits also are angels, but lower ones, for they are in the first heaven; the angelic spirits 
are in the second; and the angels, properly so called, are in the third (see n. 459, 684). Such is the form of government in the other life that the good spirits are subordinate to the angelic spirits, 
and the angelic spirits to the real angels; so that they constitute one angelic society. The good spirits and the angelic spirits are those who are here called "the lads;" but the real angels, 
"the men."  </p>

That 'except for what the young men have eaten' means good spirits is clear from what comes before and what comes after. In what has gone before, at verse 13 above, Mamre, Eshkol, and Aner are referred 
to as being Abram's allies. By these, as is evident from the explanation given at that verse, the state of the Lord's Rational Man in relation to the External Man as regards the nature of its goods 
and truths was meant; and so the angels who were present with the Lord when He was engaged in conflict were meant. The same is clear from what follows immediately below. Here those who accompanied Abram 
are called 'young men', by whom none other than good spirits are meant, whereas by 'the men', referred to immediately after, angels are meant. The fact that angels were present with the Lord when 
He fought against the hells is clear from the Word, and also from the fact that when He was engaged in the conflicts brought about by temptations the angels were bound to be present, to whom the Lord 
from His own power gave the strength and seemingly the power to fight in company with Him; for all the power which angels have derives from the Lord.  </p>
<p></p>
<p><b>[2]</b>
 That angels fight against those who are evil 
becomes clear from what has been stated in various places already about the angels that reside with man - how they protect man and ward off the evils with which spirits from hell assault him, dealt 
with already in <a href="50.htm">50</a>, <a href="227.htm">227</a>, <a href="228.htm">228</a>, <a href="697.htm">697</a>, <a href="968.htm">968</a>. Yet all the power they have derives from the Lord. Good spirits are indeed angels as well but lower ones, for they are in the first heaven, while angelic spirits 
are in the second, and angels properly so called are in the third, dealt with in <a href="459.htm">459</a>, <a href="684.htm">684</a>. Such is the form of government in the next life that good spirits are subordinate to angelic spirits, and 
angelic spirits to angels themselves, so that they all constitute one angelic community. Good spirits and angelic spirits are those called 'young men' here, while angels themselves are called 'men'. </p>

'Praeter tantum quod comederunt pueri': quod significet bonos spiritus, constat ab illis quae praecedunt et ab illis quae consequuntur; ab illis quae praecedunt: supra ad vers. 13 memorantur Mamre, 
Eshkol et Aner, quod fuerint socii foederis Abrami, quibus significatus status Rationalis Hominis quoad Externum Domini, ejus bona et vera qualia essent, et sic quod per illos significati sint angeli 
qui fuerunt cum Domino cum pugnavit, ut ab explicatione ibi patet: idem constat ex illis quae consequuntur, ut mox patescet: hic qui iverunt cum Abramo, dicuntur 'pueri,' per quos non alii intelliguntur 
quam spiritus boni, at per 'viros,' de quibus mox, angeli: quod fuerint cum ex eo quod cum in pugnis tentationum esset, non potuerit aliter quam quod angeli adessent, quibus Dominus ex propria potentia 
dedit vim et quasi potentiam simul pugnandi, nam omnis potentia angelis est a Domino.  Quod angeli pugnent contra malos, constare potest ab illis quae prius passim dicta sunt de angelis apud hominem, 
quod tutentur hominem et avertant mala quae infernales spiritus intentant, de quibus prius n. 50, 227, 228, 697, 968; sed omnis potentia illorum est a Domino: boni spiritus sunt quidem etiam angeli 
sed inferiores, nam sunt in primo caelo, spiritus autem angelici in secundo, at angeli proprie dicti in tertio, de quibus n. 459, 684; talis est forma regiminis in altera vita quod spiritus boni sint 
subordinati spiritibus angelicis, et spiritus angelici ipsis angelis, sic ut unam societatem angelicam constituant: spiritus bona et spiritus angelici sunt qui hic dicuntur 'pueri,' at ipsi angeli 'viri.' </p>
