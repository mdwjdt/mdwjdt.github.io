<h4 align="center"></h4><p><strong>6108.</strong>创世记47:13-26.饥荒非常严重，全地都没有食物，甚至埃及地和迦南地都因饥荒衰弱无力。约瑟收聚了埃及地和迦南地所有的银子，就是他们用来买谷子的，约瑟就把那银子带到法老的宫里。埃及地和迦南地的银子都花尽了，埃及众人都来到约瑟那里，说，我们的银子都用尽了，给我们食物吧，我们为什么死在你旁边呢？约瑟说，若是银子用尽了，可以给出你们的牲畜，我就为你们的牲畜给你们食物。于是他们把牲畜赶到约瑟那里，约瑟就拿食物给他们，换了他们的马、羊群的牲畜、牛群的牲畜和驴。那一年因换他们一切的牲畜，就给他们提供食物。那一年过后，第二年他们又来到约瑟那里，对他说，我们不瞒我主，银子都花尽了，牲畜也都归了我主，我们在我主面前，除了我们的身体和土地之外，一无所剩。我们为什么要连我们带我们的土地都死在你眼前呢？用食物买我们和我们的土地，我们和我们的土地作法老的奴仆，就可以存活。给我们种子吧，使我们得以存活，不至死亡，土地也不至荒凉。于是，约瑟为法老买了埃及所有的土地，埃及人因被饥荒所迫，各都卖了自己的田地，那地就都归了法老。至于百姓，约瑟把他们都迁到城里，从埃及边界的这边直到它那边。惟有祭司的土地，约瑟没有买，因为祭司有从法老所得的常俸。他们吃法老所给他们的常俸，所以他们不卖自己的土地。约瑟对百姓说，看哪，我今日为法老买了你们和你们的土地。看，这里有种子给你们，你们可以耕种土地。到收割的时候，你们要把五分之一纳给法老，四分可以归你们作田地里的种子，也作你们和你们家人的食物，作你们小孩子的食物。他们说，你把我们救活了，但愿我们在我主眼前蒙恩，我们就作法老的仆人。于是，约瑟为埃及土地定下常例直到今日：法老必得五分之一，惟独祭司的土地，唯独他们的，不归法老。<br />“全地都没有食物”表那良善不再显现。“饥荒非常严重”表荒凉。“甚至埃及地和迦南地都因饥荒衰弱无力”表在（记忆知识所在的）属世层和教会中也是如此。“约瑟收聚了所有的银子”表含有真理在里面并适合的一切记忆知识。“埃及地和迦南地”表那存在于属世层和教会中的。“就是他们用来买谷子的”表他们要以此来得以维持。“约瑟就把那银子带到法老的宫里”表记忆知识都被带入与属世层里面的总体之物的联系之中。“埃及地和迦南地的银子都花尽了”表由于荒凉，在属世层和教会中不再能够看到含有真理在里面并适合的记忆知识。“埃及众人都来到约瑟那里”表转向内在。“说，给我们食物吧”表祈求维持属灵生命。“我们的银子都用尽了，我们为什么死在你旁边呢”表否则，属灵的死亡就会因真理的缺乏而出现。“约瑟说”表回答所来自的内在。“可以给出你们的牲畜，我就为你们的牲畜给你们食物”表他们将提供真理之良善，并得以维持。“若是银子用尽了”表若他们不再看见真理。“于是他们把牲畜赶到约瑟那里”表他们所提供的真理之良善。“约瑟就拿食物给他们”表属灵生命的维持。“换了他们的马”表从理解力所提供的记忆知识。“羊群的牲畜、牛群的牲畜”表内层真理之良善和外层真理之良善。“和驴”表服务类的事物。“因换他们一切的牲畜，就给他们提供食物”表通过来自内在的良善之流注而维持。“那一年”表这种状态的时期。“那一年过后”表该状态的时期之后的荒凉。“第二年他们又来到约瑟那里”表下一个状态的开始。“对他说，我们不瞒我主”表对内在十分清楚的觉知。“银子都花尽了”表由于荒凉而不再看见真理。“牲畜也都归了我主”表真理之良善同样如此。“我们在我主面前，除了我们的身体和土地之外，一无所剩”表良善与真理的容器变得完全荒凉了。“我们为什么要连我们带我们的土地都死在你眼前呢”表它们若不荒凉，就不会再有内在之下的任何属灵生命。“用食物买我们和我们的土地”表要将这二者都变成自己的，好叫他们能靠良善来维持。“我们和我们的土地作法老的奴仆，就可以存活”表完全顺服。“给我们种子吧”表仁之良善和信之真理以这种方式的一种流注。“使我们得以存活，不至死亡”表从它们或此源头所获得的属灵生命，以及不再对诅咒恐惧。“土地也不至荒凉”表心智必用教会的记忆知识来培养。“于是，约瑟为法老买了埃及所有的土地”表内在将记忆知识所在的整个属世心智完全变成它自己的，并将其置于它的全面掌控之下。“埃及人各都卖了自己的田地”表对服务教会的一切事物的放弃和交出。“因被饥荒所迫”表因为荒凉到了绝望的地步。“那地就都归了法老”表一切事物都服从属世层，而属世层在内在掌控之下。“至于百姓，约瑟把他们都迁到城里”表含有真理在里面的记忆知识都被带入与教义事物的联系之中，或说都被归入教义的不同领域。“从埃及边界的这边直到它那边”表遍及记忆知识所在的整个属世层。“惟有祭司的土地，约瑟没有买”表内在从属世层那里为自己获得了接受良善的一切能力，因为这些能力都来自它自己。“因为祭司有从法老所得的常俸”表因此，它是由属世层按秩序安排的，这在内在的掌控之下。“他们吃法老所给他们的常俸”表除了按秩序安排的外，他们没有将任何良善变成他们自己的。“所以他们不卖自己的土地”表因此，他们不需要放弃或交出这些事物。“约瑟对百姓说”表内在进入含有真理在里面的记忆知识的流注。“看哪，我今日为法老买了你们和你们的土地”表它为自己获得这些事物，并使它们服从内在掌控之下的属世层中的总体之物之物。“看，这里有种子给你们，你们可以耕种土地”表要被植入的仁之良善和信之真理。“到收割的时候”表由此而来的果实。“你们要把五分之一纳给法老”表余留要被归入内在掌控之下的属世层中的总体之物。“四分可以归你们”表那些尚未变成余留的事物。“作田地里的种子”表作心智的滋养。“也作你们和你们家人的食物”表以便真理之良善由此能存在于每一个事物中。“作你们小孩子的食物”表在那些属于纯真的事物中。“他们说，你把我们救活了”表非以其它方式，也非来自其它源头的属灵生命。“但愿我们在我主眼前蒙恩”表他们以这种方式变得服从并谦卑的意愿。“我们就作法老的仆人”表他们要放弃自己的东西，顺服内在掌控之下的属世层。“于是，约瑟定下常例”表基于同意的结论。“直到今日”表永远。“为埃及土地，法老必得五分之一”表余留，和前面一样。“惟独祭司的土地，唯独他们的，不归法老”表接受良善的一切能力皆直接来自内在。</p>

Verses 13-26. And there was no bread in all the land, because the famine was very grievous, and the land of Egypt and the land of Canaan labored by reason of the famine. And Joseph gathered together 
all the silver that was found in the land of Egypt, and in the land of Canaan, for the produce which they bought; and Joseph brought the silver into Pharaoh's house. And when the silver was all spent 
in the land of Egypt, and in the land of Canaan, all Egypt came unto Joseph, saying, Give us bread; for why should we die beside thee because the silver faileth? And Joseph said, Give your cattle; and 
I will give you for your cattle, if silver fail. And they brought their cattle unto Joseph; and Joseph gave them bread [in exchange] for the horses, and for the cattle of the flock, and for the cattle 
of the herd, and for the asses; and he provided them with bread [in exchange] for all their cattle in this year. And when this year was ended, they came unto him in the second year, and said to him, 
We will not hide from my lord how that the silver is spent; and the cattle of the beast is to my lord; there is naught left before my lord, besides our body, and our ground: wherefore should we die before 
thine eyes, both we and our ground? buy us and our ground for bread, and we shall live, and our ground, servants to Pharaoh; and give seed, that we may live, and not die, and the ground be not laid 
waste. And Joseph bought all the ground of Egypt for Pharaoh; for the Egyptians sold everyone his field, because the famine grew strong upon them; and the land was Pharaoh's. And as for the people, 
he removed it to the cities from one end of the border of Egypt even to the other end thereof. Only the ground of the priests bought he not; because a portion was appointed for the priests by Pharaoh, 
and they ate their appointed portion which Pharaoh had given them; wherefore they sold not their ground. And Joseph said unto the people, Behold I have bought you this day and your ground for Pharaoh; 
lo here is seed for you, and ye shall sow the ground. And it shall be in the ingatherings that ye shall give a fifth to Pharaoh, and four parts shall be for you, for seed of the field, and for your 
food, and for them in your houses, and for food for your babes. And they said, Thou hast made us live; let us find grace in the eyes of my lord, and we will be Pharaoh's servants. And Joseph made it 
a statute even unto this day, concerning the ground of Egypt, that Pharaoh should have the fifth; only the ground of the priests, only theirs, was not Pharaoh's. "And there was no bread in all the land," 
signifies that good no longer appeared; "because  the famine was very grievous," signifies desolation; "and the land of Egypt and the land of Canaan labored by reason of the famine," signifies 
that this was in the natural and within the church; "and Joseph gathered together all the silver," signifies all true and adaptable memory-knowledge; "that was found in the land of Egypt, and in the land 
of Canaan," signifies that was in the natural and in the church; "for the produce which they bought," signifies that thereby they were sustained; "and Joseph brought the silver into Pharaoh's house," 
signifies that it was all brought into relation to what is general in the natural; "and when the silver was all spent in the land of Egypt, and in the land of Canaan," signifies that on account of 
the desolation, true and adaptable memory-knowledge was no longer to be seen in the natural and within the church; "all Egypt came unto Joseph," signifies application to the internal; "saying, Give us 
bread," signifies an entreaty concerning the sustenance of the spiritual life; "for why should we die beside thee because silver faileth?" signifies that otherwise by reason of the lack of truth there 
would be spiritual death; "and Joseph said," signifies the internal from which is the answer; "Give your cattle, and I will give you [in exchange] for your cattle," signifies that they should bring 
forward the goods of truth, and they would be sustained; "if silver fail," signifies if truth is no longer visible to them; "and they brought their cattle unto Joseph," signifies the goods of truth,

"and for the cattle of the flock, and for the cattle of the herd," signifies interior and exterior goods of truth; "and for the asses," signifies things of service; "and he provided them with bread [in 
exchange] for all their cattle," signifies sustenance through the influx of good from the internal; "in this year," signifies the period of this state; "and when this year was ended," signifies desolation 
after the period of this state; "they came unto him in the second year," signifies the beginning of the following state; "and said to him, We will not hide from my lord," signifies a perception

like manner; "there is nought left before my lord, besides our body and our ground," signifies that the receptacles of good and truth were completely desolated; "wherefore should we die before thine 
eyes, both we and our ground?" signifies that if they should be desolated there would no longer be spiritual life under the internal; "buy us and our ground for bread," signifies the appropriation of 
both receptacles, that they may be sustained with good; "and we shall live, and our ground, servants to Pharaoh," signifies total submission; "and give seed," signifies in this way an influx of the good 
of charity and of the truth of faith; "that we may live and not die," signifies spiritual life from this source, and no longer any fear of damnation; "and the ground be not laid waste," signifies 
that the mind must be cultivated with the memory-knowledges of the church; "and Joseph bought all the ground of Egypt for Pharaoh," signifies that the internal appropriated to itself the whole natural 
mind where memory-knowledges are, and placed it under general auspices; "for the Egyptians sold every one his field," signifies the renunciation and subjection of all things which are of service to the 
church; "because the famine grew strong upon them," signifies because there was desolation even to despair; "and the land was Pharaoh's," signifies that all things were subjected to the natural that 
was under the auspices of the internal; "and as for the people he removed it to the cities," signifies that truths of memory-knowledge were referred to doctrinal things; "from one end of the border

into the truths of memory-knowledge; "Behold I have bought you this day and your ground for Pharaoh," signifies that it procured these for itself, and made them subject to the general in the natural 
that was under the auspices of the internal; "lo here is seed for you, and ye shall sow the ground," signifies the good of charity and the truth of faith that were to be implanted; "and it shall 
be in the ingatherings," signifies the fruits thence derived; "that ye shall give a fifth to Pharaoh," signifies remains, that these are for the general in the natural that is under the auspices of the 
internal; "and four parts shall be for you," signifies those things which were not yet remains; "for seed of the field," signifies for the nourishment of the mind; "and for your food, and for them 
in your houses," signifies that thereby the good of truth may be in each and all things; "and for food for your babes," signifies in those things which are of innocence; "and they said, Thou hast made 
us live," signifies spiritual life in no other manner and from no other source; "let us find grace in the eyes of my lord," signifies the will that in this way they be made subject, and humiliation;

from consent; "even unto this day," signifies eternally; "concerning the ground of Egypt, that Pharaoh should have the fifth," signifies remains, as before; "only the ground of the priests, only 
theirs, was not Pharaoh's," signifies capacities to receive good, that these are immediately from the internal. </p>

Verses 13-26 And there was no bread in all the land, for the famine was extremely serious; and the land of Egypt and the land of Canaan languished from the presence of the famine. And Joseph gathered 
up all the silver found in the land of Egypt and in the land of Canaan, for the corn which they were buying; and Joseph caused the silver to come to Pharaoh's house. And when the silver was used up in 
the land of Egypt and in the land of Canaan, all Egypt came to Joseph, saying, Give us bread; and why should we die near by you because the silver is lacking? And Joseph said, Give your livestock, and 
I will give you [bread] in exchange for your livestock, if the silver is lacking. And they caused their livestock to come to Joseph, and Joseph gave them bread in exchange for horses, and for livestock 
of the flock, and for livestock of the herd, and for asses; and he provided them with bread in exchange for all their livestock that year. And that year ended, and they came to him in the second 
year, and said to him, We will not hide from [my] lord, that since the silver has been used up and the livestock of the beasts has passed to [my] lord, nothing is left before [my] lord apart from our 
bodies and our ground. Why should we die before your eyes, both we and our ground? Buy us and our ground for bread, and we will live, and our ground, as Pharaoh's slaves; and give us seed so that we may 
live and not die, and the ground may not become a waste. And Joseph bought all the ground of Egypt for Pharaoh, for the Egyptians sold, each one his field, because the famine overwhelmed them; and 
the land was Pharaoh's. And the people, he transferred them to the cities from one end of the border of Egypt to the other end of it. Only the ground of the priests he did not buy, for the priests had 
a fixed portion from Pharaoh and ate their fixed portion which Pharaoh had given them; therefore they did not sell their ground. And Joseph said to the people, Behold, I have bought you today, and your 
ground, for Pharaoh; look, here is seed for you, and you may sow the ground. And so it will be at ingatherings,<A name="fntext1"></a><A href="#fn1"><sup>a</sup></a> that you shall give a fifth to Pharaoh, and four portions shall be yours, for seed of 
the field, and for your food, and for those in your households, and for food for your young children. And they said, You have bestowed life on us; let us find favour in the eyes of [my] lord, and we 
will be Pharaoh's slaves. And Joseph made it a statute even to this day regarding the ground of Egypt, that a fifth went to Pharaoh. Only the ground of the priests, theirs alone, did not belong to Pharaoh. 
 </p>
<p>'And there was no bread in all the land' means that good was not apparent any longer. 'For the famine was extremely serious' means desolation. 'And the land of Egypt and the land of Canaan 
languished from the presence of the famine' means that this was so in the natural [where factual knowledge resides], and within the Church. 'And Joseph gathered up all the silver' means all factual knowledge 
that held truth in it and was appropriate. 'Found in the land of Egypt and in the land of Canaan' means that was present in the natural and in the Church. 'For the corn which they were buying' 
means that they were to be sustained by this. 'And Joseph caused the silver to come to Pharaoh's house' means that factual knowledge was brought into association with the general whole within the natural. 
'And when the silver was used up in the land of Egypt and in the land of Canaan' means that factual knowledge that held truth in it and was appropriate could be seen no longer in the natural or 
within the Church on account of the desolation. 'And all Egypt came to Joseph' means a turning to the internal. 'Saying, Give us bread' means a plea for the sustainment of spiritual life. 'And why should 
we die near by you because the silver is lacking?' means that otherwise spiritual death takes place because of the lack of truth. 'And Joseph said' means the internal from which the response came. 
'Give your livestock, and I will give you [bread] in exchange for your livestock' means that they were to offer forms of the good of truth and would be sustained. 'If the silver is lacking' means if 
truth could no longer be seen by them. 'And they caused their livestock to come to Joseph' means that forms of the good of truth were offered. 'And Joseph gave them bread' means the sustainment of spiritual 
life. 'In exchange for horses' means factual knowledge supplied from the understanding. 'And for livestock of the flock and for livestock of the herd' means forms of the good of truth, interior 
and exterior ones. 'And for asses' means things of a subservient nature. 'And he provided them with bread in exchange for all their livestock' means the sustainment by means of an influx of good from 
the internal. 'That year' means the period covered by that state. 'And that year ended' means the desolation that followed the period covered by this state. 'And they came to him in the second year' 
means the beginning of the next state. 'And said to him, We will not hide from [my] lord' means a perception that it is well known to the internal. 'Since the silver has been used up' means that truth 
can be seen no longer because of the desolation. 'And the livestock of the beasts has passed to [my] lord' means similarly the good of truth. 'Nothing is left before [my] lord apart from our bodies and 
our ground' means that the receptacles of goodness and truth have been made completely desolate. 'Why should we die before your eyes, both we and our ground?' means that if they have been made desolate 
there is no longer any spiritual life beneath the internal. 'Buy us and our ground for bread' means it should make both its own so that they may be sustained with good. 'And we will live, and our 
ground, as Pharaoh's slaves' means total submission. 'And give us seed' means an influx, as a result of this, of the good of charity and the truth of faith. 'So that we may live and not die' means spiritual 
life from them, and the fear no longer of damnation. 'And the ground may not become a waste' means that the mind must be cultivated with the facts known to the Church. 'And Joseph bought all the 
ground of Egypt for Pharaoh' means that the internal made the entire natural mind where factual knowledge resides its own and placed it under its overall control. 'And the Egyptians sold, each one 
his field' means a renunciation and surrender of everything of service to the Church. 'Because the famine overwhelmed them' means because the desolation reached the point of despair. 'And the land was 
Pharaoh's' means that all things were made subject to the natural, which was under the control of the internal. 'And the people, he transferred them to the cities' means that facts holding truths within 
them were assigned to different areas of doctrine. 'From one end of the border of Egypt to the other end of it' means a spread throughout the whole natural where factual knowledge resides. 'Only the 
ground of the priests he did not buy' means that the internal obtained for itself from the natural every capacity to receive good, because every such capacity came from itself. 'For the priests had 
a fixed portion from Pharaoh' means that this had (therefore] been decreed by the natural, which was under the control of the internal. 'And ate their fixed portion which Pharaoh had given them' means 
that they did not make any forms of good their own beyond what had been decreed. 'Therefore they did not sell their ground' means that for this reason they had no need to renounce those things or surrender 
them. 'And Joseph said to the people' means an influx of the internal into the facts that have truths within them. 'Behold, I have bought you today, and your ground, for Pharaoh' means that it 
had obtained those things for itself and had made them subject to the general whole in the natural, which was under the control of the internal. 'Look, here is seed for you, and you may sow the ground' 
means the good of charity and the truth of faith that are to be implanted. 'And so it will be at ingatherings' means the fruits from this. 'That you shall give a fifth to Pharaoh' means that remnants 
are to be assigned to the general whole, which is under the control of the internal. 'And four portions shall be yours' means those things which have not yet become remnants. 'For seed of the field' 
means for mental nourishment. 'And for your food, and for those in your households' means so that the good of truth may therefore be present within every single part. 'And for food for your young children' 
means in those things that are forms of innocence. 'And they said, You have bestowed life on us' means spiritual life, in no other way and from no other source. 'Let us find favour in the eyes 
of [my] lord' means a willingness to be made subject in this way, and self-abasement. 'And we will be Pharaoh's slaves' means that they should renounce what is properly their own and become submissive 
to the natural, which is under the control of the internal. 'And Joseph made it a statute' means a conclusion based on consent. 'Even to this day' means lasting for ever. 'Regarding the ground of Egypt, 
that a fifth went to Pharaoh' means remnants, as previously. 'Only the ground of the priests, theirs alone, did not belong to Pharaoh' means every capacity to receive good came directly from the 
internal.

Vers. 13-26.  Et panis nullus in omni terra, quia gravis fames valde, et laborabat terra Aegypti et terra Canaan a coram fame.  Et collegit Joseph omne argentum inventum in terra Aegypti et in terra 
Canaan, in annona, quam illi ementes; et venire fecit Joseph argentum domum Pharaonis.  Et consumptum argentum e terra Aegypti et e terra Canaan, et venerunt omnis Aegyptus ad Josephum, dicendo, Da nobis 
panem; et cur moriemur juxta te, quia deficit argentum?  Et dixit Joseph, Date pecora vestra, et dabo vobis iii pecoribus vestris, si deficit argentum?  Et venire fecerunt pecora sua ad Josephum, 
et dedit illis Joseph panem pro equis, et pro pecore gregis, et pro pecore armenti, et pro asinis, et providit illos pane pro omni pecore eorum, in anno hoc.  Et finitus annus hic, et venerunt ad illum 
in anno altero, et dixerunt ei, Non celabimus a domino, siquidem consumptum argentum, et pecus bestiae, ad dominum, non relictum coram domino praeter quam corpus nostrum et humus nostra.  Quare moriemur 
ad oculos tuos, etiam nos, etiam humus nostra? eme nos, et humum nostram pro pane, et vivemus nos et humus nostra servi Pharaoni, et da semen, et vivamus et non (x)moriamur, et humus non vastata 
sit.  Et emit Joseph omnem humum Aegypti Pharaoni, quia vendiderunt Aegyptii quisque agrum suum, quoniam invaluit super illos fames; et fuit terra Pharaoni.  Et populum transtulit illum ad urbes a fine 
termini Aegypti {1} ad finem illius.  Solum (t)humum sacerdotum non emit, quia pars statuta sacerdotibus a Pharaone, et comederunt partem statutam suam, quam dederat illis Pharaoh, propterea non vendiderunt 
humum suam.  Et dixit Joseph ad populum, Ecce emi vos hodie (x)et humum vestram Pharaoni, en vobis semen, et seratis humum.  Et erit, in proventibus et dabitis quintam Pharaoni, et quatuor partes 
erit vobis ad semen agri, et ad cibum vestrum, et illis in domibus vestris, et ad cibum infantibus vestris.  Et dixerunt, Vivificasti nos, inveniamus gratiam in oculis domini, et erimus servi Pharaoni.
