<h3 align="center" class="ired">属天的奥秘 第3030节</h3>
<h4 align="center"></h4><p><strong>3030.</strong>“倘若那女人不肯跟我到此地来”表属世人怀疑那情感是否可以分离。 这从“女人”和“跟”或“跟我到此地”的含义清楚可知。“女人”是指真理，在此是指来自属世人的真理，这真理要与神圣理性良善结合；由于一切结合都藉着情感实现，如前所述（<a href="3024.htm">3024</a>节），故“女人”表示对这真理的情感。“跟”或“跟我到此地”是指与属世人分离，并与理性人结合，因为“地”在此和前面（<a href="3026.htm">3026</a>节）一样，表示属于理性的爱之良善。从经上说“倘若她不肯”可以看出有怀疑。<br />由上述内容可以看出，这些话和接下来直到8节及之后的那些话包含什么。为更好地理解这些事，我们可以说得更详细一点。真正的理性通过良善存在，通过真理显现。良善经由内在途径流入，而真理则经由外在途径流入。良善以这种方式在理性中与真理结合，并使得理性成为理性。若非良善在那里与真理结合，就没有任何理性可言，尽管看似有，因为人有推理能力（<a href="1944.htm">1944</a>节）。这就是理性在人身上得以形成的正常方式。<br />由于主和其他人一样出生，并且愿意和其他人一样接受教导，所以祂也愿意以同样的方式使祂的理性变成神性，也就是说，通过经由内在途径从其神性而来的流注使其理性变成良善方面的神性，通过经由外在途径而来的流注使其理性变成真理方面的神性。因此，良善方面的理性就这样形成，以至于处在预备接受真理的状态。这种形成由本章开头那几句话来表示，即“亚伯拉罕老了，到了日子；耶和华在一切事上都赐福给他”，也就是主的人性要变成神性，一切事物要被主重新排列，归入神序之时（参看<a href="3016.htm">3016</a>，<a href="3017.htm">3017</a>节）。接下来的考虑是，真理要与这理性的良善结合，并且如前所述，这种结合以正常方式实现，也就是藉着从属世人中被召唤出来的记忆知识和认知实现。<br />经由内在途径形成的理性的良善本身就是土地本身，而真理则是播种在这地里的种子。真正的理性从不以其它方式出生。为叫这理性能以同样的方式在主里面形成，并凭祂自己的能力变成神性，主来到世间，愿意像其他人那样出生。否则，祂根本不用出生就能披上一个人身，正如古时祂向人们显现时经常所行的那样。<br />这些就是本章所包含的事，也就是说，真理如何从属世人中被召唤出来，要与这理性的良善结合；由于那里的良善是神性，故那里的真理也要变成神性。对于世人，尤其对于不知道理性是不同于属世层的某种事物，因而不知道理性是藉着认知逐步形成的人来说，这些事极其模糊，以至于他理解不了。但对于那些对理性人和属世人有所了解，并拥有某种启示的人来说，它们都是些很容易理解的事。天使能如同在大白天那样看到它们。<br />为获得有关它们的某种概念，请参阅以下已经阐述和说明的要点，即：真理方面的理性是通过进入记忆知识和认知的流注形成的（<a href="1495.htm">1495</a>，<a href="1563.htm">1563</a>，<a href="1900.htm">1900</a>，<a href="1964.htm">1964</a>节）；它并非从知识和认知，而是从对它们的情感而生（<a href="1895.htm">1895</a>，<a href="1900.htm">1900</a>节）；知识和认知只是良善的器皿（<a href="1469.htm">1469</a>，<a href="1496.htm">1496</a>节）；空洞的知识必被摧毁（<a href="1489.htm">1489</a>，<a href="1492.htm">1492</a>，<a href="1499.htm">1499</a>，<a href="1500.htm">1500</a>节）；在理性中，对良善的情感如同对真理的情感里面的灵魂（<a href="2072.htm">2072</a>节）；何为对理性真理的情感，何为对纯记忆真理的情感（<a href="2503.htm">2503</a>节）；外在人凭认知与内在人结合，也就是说，当认知被植入在爱与仁的属天之物里面时，理性人便与属世人结合（<a href="1450.htm">1450</a>，<a href="1451.htm">1451</a>，<a href="1453.htm">1453</a>，<a href="1616.htm">1616</a>节）。</p>

<p align="center"><b>Potts(1905-1910) 3030</b></p><p><b>3030.</b>
Peradventure the woman will not be willing to follow me unto this land. That this signifies a doubt of the natural man concerning that affection, as to whether it was separable, is evident from the signification 
of "woman," as being truth, here from the natural, which was to be conjoined with the Divine good of the rational. And as all conjunction is effected by means of affection (as was said above, 
n. 3024), so by "woman" is signified the affection of that truth: and also from the signification of "going after" or "following me unto this land," as being to be separated from the natural and 
conjoined with the rational; for "land" here as above (n. 3026) is the good of love that is of the rational. That there is doubt is seen from its being said, "Peradventure she be not willing."  [2] From 
what has been said above, it is evident what is involved in these words, and in what follows to verse 8, and further; and in order that these things may be better understood, we may say a few words 
more. The genuine rational is from good, but comes forth [existit] from truth. Good flows in by an internal way; but truth by an external way. Good thus conjoins itself with truth in the rational, and 
they cause the rational to be. Unless the good therein is conjoined with truth, there is no rational; although there appears to be, because the man can reason (n. 1944). This is the common way in which 
the rational is formed with man. [3] As the Lord was born like another man, and as it was His will to be instructed like another man, so did He will to make His rational Divine in a similar way, 
namely, as to good by influx from His Divine by the internal way, and as to truth by influx through the external way. When therefore the rational as to good had been so far formed as to be in a state 
for receiving truth (which is meant by the words in the beginning of this chapter, "Abraham being old was come into days, and Jehovah blessed Abraham in all things," by which is signified when the state 
was at hand that the Lord's Human should be made Divine, and when all things should be disposed into Divine order, as may be seen above, n. 3016, 3017), there next follows that truth is to be conjoined 
with the good of the rational, and this, as before said, by the common way, that is, by means of memory-knowledges and knowledges from the natural man. [4] The good itself of the rational, which 
is formed by the internal way, is the very ground; but truth is the seed which is to be sown in this ground. The genuine rational is never born in any other way. In order that it might come forth with 
the Lord in the same way, and be made Divine by His own power, the Lord came into the world, and it was His will to be born as are other men. Otherwise He might have assumed a human without birth, 
as was frequently done in ancient times when He appeared to men. [5] These are the things contained in this chapter, namely, how truth, called forth from the natural man, was to be conjoined with the 
good of the rational; and as the good there was Divine, how the truth there should also be made Divine. To man these things (especially to one who does not know that the rational is something distinct 
from the natural, and who therefore does not know that the rational is formed successively, and this by knowledges) are very obscure, so that they are not understood; but still they are among things 
easily understood by those who have any knowledge concerning the rational and the natural man, and who are in enlightenment. The angels see them all as in clear day. [6] Some idea of them may be obtained 
from what has been said and shown above, namely: That the rational as to truth is formed by influx into memory-knowledges and knowledges (n. 1495, 1563, 1900, 1964): That it is not born from these 
two kinds of knowledges, but from the affection of them (n. 1895, 1900): That these two kinds of knowledges are only vessels for good (n. 1469, 1496): That empty memory-knowledges must be destroyed 
(n. 1489, 1492, 1499, 1500): That in the rational, the affection of good is as a soul in the affection of truth (n. 2072): What is the affection of rational truth, and of the truth of mere memory (n. 
2503): That by knowledges the external man is conjoined with the internal, that is, the rational man with the natural, when knowledges are being implanted in things celestial, which are those of love 
and charity (n. 1450, 1451, 1453, 1616). </p>

<p align="center"><b>Elliott(1983-1999) 3030</b></p><p><b>3030.</b>
'Perhaps the woman is not willing to go after me to this land' means doubt in the natural man as to whether that affection was separable. This is clear from the meaning of 'the woman' as truth, here 
truth from the natural, that was to be joined to the Divine good of the Rational, though as all joining together is effected by means of affection, as stated above in <a href="3024.htm">3024</a>, 'the women' accordingly means 
the affection for that truth; and from the meaning of 'going after me', or following, 'to this land' as being separated from the natural and joined to the Rational, for 'land' here, as above in <a href="3026.htm">3026</a>, 
means the good of love which belongs to the Rational. The fact that doubt is meant may be seen from the remark 'perhaps she is not willing to'. From what has been stated above one may see what is embodied 
in these words and those that follow to verse 8, and beyond that. Yet to make them even more intelligible let a little more be stated here. </p>
<p></p>
<p><b>[2]</b>
 The genuine rational derives its being from good 
but its manifestation from truth. Good flows in by an internal route, but truth by an external route. In this manner good joins itself in the rational to truth and causes it to be the rational. Unless 
good is joined there to truth it is not the rational, even though it may seem to be because of the person's ability to reason, <a href="1944.htm">1944</a>. This is the normal way in which the rational is formed with man. </p>
<p></p>
<p><b>[3]</b>
Now because the Lord was born like any other, and was willing to be taught like any other, He was also willing in a like manner to make His Rational Divine, that is to say, to make it Divine 
as regards good through influx from His Divine by the internal route, and as regards truth through influx by the external route. The Rational was therefore so formed as regards good that it was in a 
state ready to receive truth. (That forming is meant by the opening words of this chapter, 'Abraham, being old, was advanced in years, and Jehovah blessed Abraham in all things', namely, when the state 
was reached for the Lord's Human to become Divine, and all things had been re-arranged by the Lord into Divine order, see <a href="3016.htm">3016</a>, <a href="3017.htm">3017</a>.) And there now follows the consideration that truth was to be joined 
to the good of the Rational. And this, as has been stated, was effected in the normal way, that is, by means of facts and cognitions summoned from the natural man. </p>
<p></p>
<p><b>[4]</b>
 The good itself of the rational 
which is formed by the internal route is the ground itself, while truth is the seed that is to be sown in the ground. The genuine rational is born in no other way. So that the Rational might be 
formed in the same way in the Lord and be made Divine by His own power, the Lord came into the world and was willing to be born like any other. Otherwise he could have assumed a human presence without 
being born at all as He had done on many occasions in ancient times when He had appeared to men. These are the considerations contained in this chapter, namely the following: The way in which truth 
was summoned from the natural man to be joined to the good of the rational; and - since the good there was Divine - the truth there was to become Divine too. To man, especially to one who does not know 
that the rational is anything distinct and separate from the natural and who therefore does not know that the rational is formed by consecutive stages, by means of cognitions, all of this is so utterly 
obscure as to be unintelligible to him. But to those who do know something about the rational and the natural man, and have some enlightenment, such considerations are among those that are quite 
easy to grasp. And angels see them plainly as if in broad daylight. To gain some idea of them, see the following points that have been stated and shown already: </p>
<p> As to truth the rational is formed through 
influx into knowledge and cognitions, <a href="1495.htm">1495</a>, <a href="1563.htm">1563</a>, <a href="1900.htm">1900</a>, <a href="1964.htm">1964</a>. </p>
<p>It is not born from knowledge and cognitions but from the affection for these, <a href="1895.htm">1895</a>, <a href="1900.htm">1900</a>. </p>
<p>Knowledge and cognitions are merely 
vessels for good, <a href="1469.htm">1469</a>, <a href="1496.htm">1496</a>.  </p>
<p>Empty facts have to be destroyed, <a href="1489.htm">1489</a>, <a href="1492.htm">1492</a>, <a href="1499.htm">1499</a>,<a href="1500.htm">1500</a>. </p>
<p>In the rational the affection for good is present as the soul within the affection for truth, <a href="2072.htm">2072</a>. </p>
<p>What 
the affection for rational truth and for factual truth are, <a href="2503.htm">2503</a>. </p>
<p>By means of cognitions the external man is joined to the internal man, that is, the rational man to the natural man, when cognitions 
are implanted in the celestial things of love and charity, <a href="1450.htm">1450</a>, <a href="1451.htm">1451</a>, <a href="1453.htm">1453</a>, <a href="1616.htm">1616</a>. </p>

sit cum vero, non est rationale, tametsi appareat ex eo quod ratiocinari possit homo quod sit, n. 1944; haec est via communia, perquam {3}rationale apud hominem formatur: [3] Dominus quia natus sicut 
alius homo, et voluit instrui sicut alius homo, ita quoque similiter voluit facere Rationale Suum Divinum, nempe quoad bonum per influxum ex Suo Divino per viam internam, et quoad verum per influxum 
per viam externam; cum itaque Rationale quoad bonum formatum est, usque adeo ut in statu esset recipiendi verum, quod intellectum per verba in principio hujus capitis, `Abraham senex venit in dies, et 
Jehovah benedixit Abrahamo in omnibus,' quibus quod significatum, cum adesset status quod Humanum Domini fieret Divinum, et in Divinum ordinem omnia disposita essent, videatur n. 3016, 3017, [4] nunc 
sequitur quod bono Rationalis verum conjungendum sit, et hoc, ut dictum, per viam communem, hoc est, per scientifica et cognitiones e naturali homine: ipsum bonum rationalis, quod formatur per viam
