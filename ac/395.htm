<h4 align="center"></h4><p><strong>395.</strong>“凡杀该隐的必遭报七倍”表严禁侵犯这样被分离的信。这一点通过“该隐”与“七”的含义明显可知：“该隐”表从仁分离之信；“七”表神圣事物。数字“七”被尊为圣，这是众所周知的，因为六日创造，第七日成为属天之人，他里面有平安，宁静和安息日。因此这个数字经常出现在犹太教会的宗教仪式中，处处被认为神圣，并且时间周期，无论长短，也被分为七，被称为“周”，例如弥赛亚降临之前的漫长的时间间隔（但以理书<a href="http://39-27.cn/但9.24.htm">9:24</a>-<a href="http://39-27.cn/但9.25.htm">25</a>）；拉班和雅各也称七年为一“周”（创世记<a href="http://39-27.cn/创29.27.htm">29:27</a>-<a href="http://39-27.cn/创29.28.htm">28</a>）。由于同样的原因，凡数字“七” 出现的地方，都代表神圣或不可侵犯。因此，我们在诗篇读到：“一天七次赞美你。”（诗篇<a href="http://39-27.cn/诗119.164.htm">119:164</a>）<br />以赛亚书：“月光必像日光，日光必加七倍，像七日的光一样。”（以赛亚书<a href="http://39-27.cn/赛30.26.htm">30:26</a>）“日”表爱，“月”表出于爱的信，它必如同爱。由于人在到达第七日，也就是成为属天之人之前，其重生的时期被分成了六日，所以人荒废到无一丝属天成分存留的时期也被分成六日。犹太人数次被掳，以及最后一次，或被掳到巴比伦，历时七年或七十年就体现了这一点。经上还几次提到，地要在安息日安息。尼布甲尼撒同样体现了这一点，如：“使他的心改变，不再是人的，给他一个兽心，使他经过七期。”（但以理书<a href="http://39-27.cn/但4.16.htm">4:16</a>，<a href="http://39-27.cn/但4.25.htm">25</a>，<a href="http://39-27.cn/但4.32.htm">32</a>）<br />约翰论及末后时期的荒废：“我又看见天上有异象，大而且奇，就是七位天使掌管末了的七灾。”（启示录<a href="http://39-27.cn/启15.1.htm">15:1</a>，<a href="http://39-27.cn/启15.6.htm">6</a>-<a href="http://39-27.cn/启15.8.htm">8</a>）<br />还有：“外邦人要践踏圣城四十二个月，或六个七期。”（启示录<a href="http://39-27.cn/启11.2.htm">11:2</a>）<br />再有：“我看见里外都写着字的书卷，用七印封严了。”（启示录<a href="http://39-27.cn/启5.1.htm">5:1</a>）<br />出于同样的原因，惩罚的严厉与加重也以数字“七”来表示。如：“你们因这些事若还不听从我，我就要为你们的罪加七倍惩罚你们。”（利未记<a href="http://39-27.cn/利26.18.htm">26:18</a>，<a href="http://39-27.cn/利26.21.htm">21</a>，<a href="http://39-27.cn/利26.24.htm">24</a>，<a href="http://39-27.cn/利26.28.htm">28</a>）“七倍归还在他们身上。”（诗篇<a href="http://39-27.cn/诗79.12.htm">79:12</a>）<br />由于严禁侵犯这样被分离的信（因为它还有用，如前所述），所以就说“凡杀该隐的必遭报七倍”。</p>

<p><strong>[NCE]395.</strong> Anyone who kills Cain will suffer sevenfold vengeance means there was a sacred ban on violating the faith detached in this way. This is established by the symbolism of Cain as a detached faith and of seven as a sacred ban.<br />The number seven was held sacred, as is known,{*1} because of the six days of creation and because of the seventh day — which is the heavenly kind of person — on which there is peace, repose, a Sabbath. This is why the rituals of the Jewish religion so often involve the number seven, and each time it is seen to stand for something sacred.{*2} For this reason, different stretches of time, long and short, were divided in seven and called weeks. One instance is the long periods before the coming of the Messiah in <a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_395/bible_king-james-version_daniel_9_24-25" target=_top>Daniel 9:24-25</a>. Laban and Jacob call a period of seven years a week in <a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_395/bible_king-james-version_genesis_29_27-28" target=_top>Genesis 29:27-28</a>. So wherever the number seven occurs, it is considered as standing for something sacred, or else for a sacred ban, as in David:<br />Seven times in a day do I praise you. (<a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_395/bible_king-james-version_psalms_119_164" target=_top>Psalms 119:164</a>)<br />In Isaiah:<br />The light of the moon will be like the light of the sun, and the light of the sun will be seven times as strong, like the light of seven days. (<a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_395/bible_king-james-version_isaiah_30_26" target=_top>Isaiah 30:26</a>)<br />Here the sun is love and the moon is faith from love, which will be like love.<br />[2] Just as the stages of a person's regeneration are divided into six, which precede the seventh, or the stage of being heavenly, so too are the stages of devastation, which continues until nothing heavenly remains. This was represented by the Jews' many captivities, including the last, in Babylon — a captivity of seven "ages" or seventy years;{*3} and several times it is said that the land was to rest during its Sabbaths.{*4} Devastation was also represented by Nebuchadnezzar in Daniel:<br />His heart will change from [that of] a human, and the heart of an animal will be given to him, until seven seasons change upon him. (<a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_395/bible_king-james-version_daniel_4_16" target=_top>Daniel 4:16</a>, <a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_395/bible_king-james-version_daniel_4_25" target=_top>25</a>, <a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_395/bible_king-james-version_daniel_4_32" target=_top>32</a>)<br />Concerning the devastation of the final days as described by John:<br />I saw another sign in the sky, great and awesome: seven angels having the seven final plagues. (<a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_395/bible_king-james-version_revelation_15_1" target=_top>Revelation 15:1</a>, <a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_395/bible_king-james-version_revelation_15_6-7" target=_top>6-7</a>)<br /><a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_395/bible_king-james-version_revelation_11_2" target=_top>Revelation 11:2</a> says that the holy city will be trampled for forty-two months, which is six times seven. In the same author:<br />I saw a book written inside and on the back,{*5} sealed with seven seals. (<a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_395/bible_king-james-version_revelation_5_1" target=_top>Revelation 5:1</a>)<br />Accordingly, different severities and levels of punishment were expressed in sevens, as in Moses:<br />If after all this you do not obey me, I will castigate you seven times harder for your sins. (<a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_395/bible_king-james-version_leviticus_26_18" target=_top>Leviticus 26:18</a>, <a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_395/bible_king-james-version_leviticus_26_21" target=_top>21</a>, <a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_395/bible_king-james-version_leviticus_26_24" target=_top>24</a>, <a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_395/bible_king-james-version_leviticus_26_28" target=_top>28</a>)<br />In David:<br />Return seven times as much into our neighbors' lap. (<a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_395/bible_king-james-version_psalms_79_12" target=_top>Psalms 79:12</a>)<br />Since a sanction was placed on the violation of faith, then, because faith could be of service (as has already been said [<a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_395/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_372" target=_top>372</a>]), the present verse states that the person who kills Cain will suffer sevenfold vengeance.<br /><br /><strong>Footnotes:</strong><br />{*1} The universality of the sacred character of the number seven is sometimes explained by the fact that it is a "virgin" number (the only one between one and ten that is neither the product nor the divisor of any of the others), that it referred to the seven classical planets (the Moon, Mercury, Venus, the Sun, Mars, Jupiter, and Saturn), or that it reflects the seven notes of the octave. Swedenborg here gives the most common reason cited in the Judeo-Christian tradition. See, for example, Philo On the Creation (Philo 1993) 30-43; and for more explanation by Swedenborg, <a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_395/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_433" target=_top>433</a> below. As Swedenborg goes on to note, however, the number has negative connotations as well, indicating a period of "devastation." What unites these two concepts is perhaps the idea that the number seven represents a complete cycle. [RS]<br />{*2} On the sacred significance of the number seven in general, see note 1 in <a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_395/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_395" target=_top>395</a>; on its sacred significance in Scripture in particular, see, for example, the passages quoted in <a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_395/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_716" target=_top>716</a>, including <a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_395/bible_king-james-version_leviticus_8_10-11" target=_top>Leviticus 8:10-11</a>; <a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_395/bible_king-james-version_leviticus_16_14" target=_top>16:14</a>, <a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_395/bible_king-james-version_leviticus_16_19" target=_top>19</a>; <a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_395/bible_king-james-version_isaiah_30_26" target=_top>Isaiah 30:26</a>; <a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_395/bible_king-james-version_revelation_1_12-13" target=_top>Revelation 1:12-13</a>; <a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_395/bible_king-james-version_revelation_4_5" target=_top>4:5</a>; the passages quoted in <a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_395/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_2252#subsection-2-3" target=_top>2252:3</a>: <a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_395/bible_king-james-version_leviticus_23_15" target=_top>Leviticus 23:15</a>; <a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_395/bible_king-james-version_leviticus_25_8" target=_top>25:8</a>, <a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_395/bible_king-james-version_leviticus_25_10" target=_top>10</a>; and the passages quoted in <a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_395/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_2830#subsection-2-3" target=_top>2830:3</a>, including <a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_395/bible_king-james-version_numbers_28_11-12" target=_top>Numbers 28:11-12</a>, <a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_395/bible_king-james-version_numbers_28_18-20" target=_top>18-20</a>, <a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_395/bible_king-james-version_numbers_28_26-28" target=_top>26-28</a>.

The six years before the fallow are thus, in the exhaustion of the soil, representative of the devastation in which all heavenly properties of the individual are used up. The Sabbath is not, strictly speaking, one of the stages of spiritual devastation, but rather the symbol of the end of such devastation, that is, of regeneration.

That the words "whosoever slayeth Cain, vengeance shall be taken on him sevenfold" signify that to do violence to faith even when thus separated would be sacrilege, is evident from the signification 
of "Cain" which is faith separated from charity, and from the signification of "seven" which is what is sacred. The number "seven" was esteemed holy, as is well known, by reason of the six days of creation, 
and of the seventh, which is the celestial man, in whom is peace, rest, and the sabbath. Hence this number occurs so frequently in the rites of the Jewish Church, and is everywhere held sacred, 
and hence also both greater and less periods of time were distinguished into sevens, and were called "weeks" such as the great intervals of time to the coming of the Messiah (Dan. 9:24-25); and the time 
of seven years called a "week" by Laban and Jacob (Gen. 29:27-28). For the same reason, wherever it occurs, the number seven is accounted holy or inviolable. Thus we read in David:     Seven times 
a day do I praise Thee (Ps. 119:164). In Isaiah: </p>
<p>     The light of the moon shall be as the light of the sun, and the light of the sun shall be sevenfold, as the light of seven days (Isa. 30:26), where 
the "sun" denotes love, and the "moon" faith from love, which should be as love. As the periods of man's regeneration are distinguished into six, before the seventh arrives, that is, the celestial 
man, so also are the periods of his vastation, up to the time when nothing celestial remains. This was represented by the several captivities of the Jews, and by the last or Babylonish captivity, which 
lasted seven decades, or seventy years. It is also said several times that the earth should rest on its sabbaths. The same is represented by Nebuchadnezzar, in Daniel: </p>
<p>     His heart shall be changed 
from man, and a beast's heart shall be given unto him, and seven times shall pass over him (Dan. 4:16, 23, 32). And in John, concerning the vastation of the last times: </p>
<p>     I saw another sign 
in heaven, great and marvelous, seven angels, having the seven last plagues (Rev. 15:1, 6-8); </p>
<p>and that: </p>
<p>     The Gentiles should tread the holy city under foot forty and two months, or six times seven 
(Rev. 11:2). And again: </p>
<p>     I saw a book written within and on the back, sealed with seven seals (Rev. 5:1). For the same reason the severities and augmentations of punishment were expressed by 
the number seven; as in Moses: </p>
<p>     If ye will not yet for all this obey Me, then I will chastise you sevenfold for your sins (Lev. 26:18, 21, 24, 28). And in David: </p>
<p>     Render unto our neighbors 
sevenfold into their bosom (Ps. 79:12). Now as it was a sacrilege to do violence to faith-since as has been said it was to be of service-it is said that "whosoever should slay Cain, vengeance should 
be taken on him sevenfold." </p>

<p align="center"><b>Elliott(1983-1999) 395</b></p><p><b>395.</b>
'Anyone killing Cain, vengeance will be taken on him sevenfold' means that to violate faith thus separated was utterly forbidden. This is clear from the meaning of 'Cain' as separated faith, and from 
the meaning of 'seven' as utterly inviolable. As is well known, the number seven was considered holy on account of the six days of creation and of the seventh, which is the celestial man in whom peace, 
rest, and the Sabbath exist. This is the reason why the number seven occurs so many times in the religious ceremonies of the Jewish Church, in every instance standing for that which is holy. It is 
also the reason why periods of time, long as well as short, were divided into seven, and were called weeks, as in the case of the long time intervals leading up to the time when the Messiah was to come, 
<a href="http://bible.gospelcom.net/cgi-bin/bible?passage=Dan%209:24,%2025&amp;version=ESV&amp;interface=print&amp;showfn=yes&amp;showxref">Dan 9:24, 25</a>. A period of seven years is also called a week by Laban and Jacob, <a href="http://bible.gospelcom.net/cgi-bin/bible?passage=Gen%2029:27,%2028&amp;version=ESV&amp;interface=print&amp;showfn=yes&amp;showxref">Gen 29:27, 28</a>. Consequently wherever the number seven occurs it stands either for something holy or else for something 
utterly inviolable, as in David,  </p>
<blockquote>
Seven times in the day I praise You. <a href="http://bible.gospelcom.net/cgi-bin/bible?passage=Ps%20119:164&amp;version=ESV&amp;interface=print&amp;showfn=yes&amp;showxref">Ps 119:164</a>.   
</blockquote>
In Isaiah,  </p>
<blockquote>
The light of the moon will be as the light of the sun, and the light of the sun will be sevenfold, 
as the light of seven days. <a href="http://bible.gospelcom.net/cgi-bin/bible?passage=Isa%2030:26&amp;version=ESV&amp;interface=print&amp;showfn=yes&amp;showxref">Isa 30:26</a>.  
</blockquote>
<p>Here 'the sun' is love, and 'the moon' faith deriving from love, a faith which is to be as love.  </p>
<p></p>
<p><b>[2]</b>
 Just as the periods of man's regeneration 
divide into six before he reaches the seventh, which is the celestial man, so also do the periods of vastation even until nothing celestial is left. This was represented by the many captivities of the 
Jews, and by the last of them, the Babylonian, which was a captivity of seven decades, that is, seventy years. And it was several times stated that the land had to rest during its Sabbaths. It was also 
represented by Nebuchadnezzar, of whom it is said in Daniel, </p>
<blockquote>
His heart will be changed from man, and the heart of a beast given him until seven times will pass over him. <a href="http://bible.gospelcom.net/cgi-bin/bible?passage=Dan%204:16,%2025,%2032&amp;version=ESV&amp;interface=print&amp;showfn=yes&amp;showxref">Dan 4:16, 25, 32</a>.  
</blockquote>
<p>In 
reference to the vastation of the last times it is recorded in John,  </p>
<blockquote>
I saw another sign in heaven, great and wonderful - seven angels holding the seven <a href="http://bible.gospelcom.net/cgi-bin/bible?passage=Rev%2015:1,%206,%207&amp;version=ESV&amp;interface=print&amp;showfn=yes&amp;showxref">Rev 15:1, 6, 7</a>.   
</blockquote>
They will trample over 
the holy city for forty-two months (that is, six times seven). <a href="http://bible.gospelcom.net/cgi-bin/bible?passage=Rev%2011:2&amp;version=ESV&amp;interface=print&amp;showfn=yes&amp;showxref">Rev 11:2</a>.   In the same book,  </p>
<blockquote>
I saw a book [written] within and on the back, sealed with seven seals. <a href="http://bible.gospelcom.net/cgi-bin/bible?passage=Rev%205:1&amp;version=ESV&amp;interface=print&amp;showfn=yes&amp;showxref">Rev 5:1</a>. 
</blockquote>
<p>Severe and increased 
penalties were for the same reason expressed by the number seven, as in Moses,  </p>
<blockquote>
If you will not obey Me in this matter, I will chastise you seven times worse for your sins. <a href="http://bible.gospelcom.net/cgi-bin/bible?passage=Lev%2026:18,%2021,%2024,%2028&amp;version=ESV&amp;interface=print&amp;showfn=yes&amp;showxref">Lev 26:18, 21, 24, 28</a>.   
</blockquote>
In David,  </p>
<blockquote>
Return to our neighbours sevenfold into their bosom. <a href="http://bible.gospelcom.net/cgi-bin/bible?passage=Ps%2079:12&amp;version=ESV&amp;interface=print&amp;showfn=yes&amp;showxref">Ps 79:12</a>.  
</blockquote>
<p>So then, it is because it was utterly forbidden to violate faith - since it had a use to serve, as has been 
stated - that the statement is made about 'vengeance being taken sevenfold on him who killed Cain'.  </p>

Quod 'omnis occidens Cainum, septempliciter vindicabitur' significent quod violare fidem ita separatam sacrosanctum{1} esset, constat ex significatione 'Caini' quod sit fides separata, et ex significatione 
'septem' quod sit sacrosanctum. Septenarius numerus sanctus habitus est, ut notum, propter sex dies creationis, et septimum, qui est homo caelestis, in quo pax, quies, sabbatum; inde toties in

vastatione ultimorum temporum, apud Johannem, 	Vidi aliud signum in caelo, magnum et admirabile, angelos septem habentes plagas septem ultimas, Apoc. {x}xv 1, 6, 7; </p>
<p>quod 'urbem sanctam calcabunt mensibus 
quadraginta duobus, seu sexies septem, Apoc. xi 2; apud eundem, 	Vidi librum [scriptum] intus et a tergo, obsignatam sigillis septem, Apoc. v 1. Inde gravitates et incrementa poenae per septenarium 
exprimebantur, ut apud Mosen, 	Si ad hoc non oboediveritis Mihi, addam castigare vos septuplo propter peccata vestra, Lev. xxvi 18, 22, 24, 28: </p>
<p>apud Davidem, 	Redde vicinis nostris septuplum 
in sinum eorum,  Ps. 	lxxix 12.  Ideo nunc quia sacrosanctum erat violare fidem, quoniam inserviret, ut dictum, dicitur quod 'septempliciter vindicabitur, qui occideret Cainum.' @	1 Sacrosanctus has 
the same sense as Polynesiam 'taboo.'$ </p>
