<h3 align="center" class="ired">属天的奥秘 第9582节</h3>
<h4 align="center"></h4><p><strong>9582.</strong>在我完全清醒的状态下，主通过天使将我的灵带到某个宇宙星球，陪同的还有来自我们地球的一些灵人。我们朝右方前行，持续了两个小时。随着我们接近太阳系的边缘，先是出现一片闪亮但密集的云层，然后火红的烟雾从一道巨缝中升起。这是一道巨大的鸿沟，在那一侧将我们太阳系与星空中的一些其它世界隔开；这股火红的烟雾看上去在相当远的距离处。我被带领从这个中间区域穿过，当时那道鸿沟或裂缝下面出现许多人，他们都是灵人（灵人都以人的形式显现，实际上就是人<a href="322.htm">322</a>，<a href="1881.htm">1881</a>节）。我还听见他们在那里互相交谈；但不允许知道他们来自哪里，是何性质。不过，他们当中的一个告诉我说，他们是守卫，防止灵人未经允许就越过我们的世界进入宇宙中的另一个世界。</p>

In company with some spirits from this earth, and while in a state of wakefulness, I was conducted as to my spirit to a certain earth in the universe, by means of angels from the Lord. The progression 
took place toward the right, and continued for two hours. Near the end of our solar system, there first appeared a shining but dense cloud, and after it a fiery smoke rising up from a great chasm. A 
vast abyss separated our solar world on that side from certain worlds of the starry heaven. The fiery smoke appeared for a considerable distance. I was being carried across this middle region, when underneath 
in that chasm or abyss there appeared very many men, who were spirits (for all spirits appear in the human form, and are actually men, n. 322, 1881). I also heard them speaking to each other 
there, but was not given to know whence they came and what was their nature; however, one of them told me that they were guards to prevent spirits from this world from passing into any other world in 
the universe without the needful facilities. </p>

In a state when I was wide awake I was conveyed by the Lord as to my spirit by means of angels to some planet in the universe, accompanied by certain spirits from our own globe. The journey took us off 
to the right and lasted two hours. As we neared the edge of our solar system, there appeared first a whitish but thick cloud, and then fiery smoke rising up from a large chasm. It was a huge gulf separating 
our solar system or world on that side from certain other worlds out in space; and that fiery smoke could be seen from rather a long way off. I was being carried across the middle when there 
appeared underneath in that chasm or gulf very many people, who were spirits (for spirits appear all in human form and in actual fact are people, <a href="322.htm">322</a>, <a href="1881.htm">1881</a>). I also heard them talking to one another 
there. But where they were from and what they were like I was not allowed to know. One of them however told me that they were guards preventing spirits from crossing over from our world into some other 
in the universe, unless access had been granted.  </p>

</p><b>9582.</b>
In statu vigili ducebar quoad spiritum per angelos a Domino ad quandam tellurem in universo, comitantibus spiritibus quibusdam ex hoc orbe; progressio fiebat dextrorsum et perstabat duabus horis. Circa 
finem mundi nostri solis apparuit primum nubes candicans sed densa, et post illam fumus igneus ascendens ex magno hiatu; erat ingens vorago separans ab illa parte mundum nostrum solarem a mundis quibusdam 
caeli siderei; igneus ille fumus ad satis multam distantiam apparuit. Trans illum medium ferebat, et tunc apparuere subter in hiatu illo seu in voragine perplures homines, qui erant spiritus 
(spiritus enim apparent omnes in humana forma et actualiter sunt homines, n. 322, 1881;) audivi etiam illos ibi inter se loquentes; sed unde essent et quales, non scire dabatur; unus tamen ex illis mihi 
dicebat quod essent custodiae ne (x)spiritus transeant ab hoc mundo in quendam alterum qui in universo, absque data copia. </p>
