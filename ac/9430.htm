<h3 align="center" class="ired">属天的奥秘 第9430节</h3>
<h4 align="center"></h4><p><strong>9430.</strong>“云彩遮盖山”表圣言的最低层，因此相比之下，它是模糊的。这从“云彩”的含义清楚可知，“云彩”是指圣言的最低层，或圣言的字义（参看创世记18序言，<a href="4060.htm">4060</a>，<a href="4391.htm">4391</a>，<a href="5922.htm">5922</a>，<a href="6343.htm">6343</a>e，<a href="6752.htm">6752</a>，<a href="8106.htm">8106</a>，<a href="8443.htm">8443</a>，<a href="8781.htm">8781</a>节）。这层意义之所以被称为“云彩”，是因为相对于内义，它处于模糊之中；事实上，内义住在天堂之光中。外在意义或字义处于模糊之中，就像云彩，是因为它面向在世上的人；而内在意义或内义则面向进入天堂的人。不过，要知道，当一个人在世上时，他若在信仰和生活上处于教会的纯正教义，就会同时处于圣言的内义。因为那时，圣言的内义通过这些教义不仅铭刻在他的理解力上，还铭刻在他的意愿上；通过信仰铭刻在他的理解力上，通过生活铭刻在他的意愿上。当这种人进入天堂时，他只照圣言的内在意义来理解圣言，不再知道圣言的任何外在意义；那时，这外在意义在他看来，就像一片云，吸收或吞没它所接受的光线。<br />如前所述，现在此人照圣言的内在意义，而不是照其外在意义来理解圣言。这是因为主用与世人同在的神之真理，也就是圣言来教导所有在天上的人。原因在于，世人生活在秩序的最低层，内层的一切事物都终止于最低层。最低层可以说是内层事物的支撑，内层事物矗立在它上面并停靠于其上。文字上的圣言是在秩序最低层上的神性真理；就像属世和感官层在与神性真理同在的教会成员里面是秩序的最低层一样。内层事物终止并停靠于这最低层，如同终止并停靠于圣言的最低层。这一切就像一座房子和它的地基。房子本身是天堂，天堂的神性真理就是诸如内在意义上的圣言；而地基则是世界，世界的神性真理就是诸如外在意义上的圣言。正如房子立在它的地基上，天堂也立在教会上；因此，天上的神性真理立在地上的神性真理上。因为通过圣言，有一个持续的联系从主经由天堂一直降到世人那里。这就是为何主总是规定地上必有一个教会，好叫神性真理能在那里存在于它的最低层。这是迄今为止谁也不知道的一个奥秘，前面（<a href="9357.htm">9357</a>，<a href="9360.htm">9360</a>节）所引用的内容暗示了这个奥秘。因此，要让所有人都谨防以任何方式伤害圣言；因为伤害它就是伤害神性本身。</p>

And the cloud covered it. That this signifies the ultimate of the Word which is thus relatively obscure, is evident from the signification of "the cloud," as being the ultimate of the Word, or its literal 
sense (see the preface to Genesis 18, and n. 4060, 4391, 5922, 6343, 6752, 8106, 8443, 8781). This sense is called a "cloud," because it is in obscurity relatively to the internal sense; for this 
is in the light of heaven. That it is in obscurity and like a cloud is because it is for man while he is in the world, whereas the internal sense is for man when he comes into heaven. But be it known 
that while a man is in the world, he is in the internal sense of the Word when he is in the genuine doctrine of the church as to faith and as to life; for through this doctrine the internal sense of 
the Word is then inscribed on both his understanding and his will; on his understanding through faith; and on his will through life. When such a man comes into heaven he apprehends the Word no otherwise 
than according to its internal sense; and knows nothing of its external sense, this then appearing to him like a cloud that absorbs the rays of its light.  [2] It is said that the man then apprehends 
the Word according to its internal sense, and not according to its external sense. That it is so is because all who are in heaven are instructed by the Lord from the truth Divine that is with man, 
thus from the Word. The reason is that man is in the ultimate of order, and that all interior things terminate in the ultimate, the ultimate being as it were a support for the interior things, on which 
they subsist and rest. The Word in the letter is Divine truth in the ultimate of order; in like manner the man of the church with whom is Divine truth, in respect to his natural and sensuous mind. 
In the one, as in the other, the interior things terminate and rest, like a house on its foundation. The house itself is heaven, and there Divine truth is such as is the Word in the internal sense; and 
the foundation is the world, and there Divine truth is such as is the Word in the external sense. As a house rests on its foundation, so also heaven rests on the church; and consequently the Divine 
truth in heaven upon the Divine truth in the earth; for there is a continuous connection from the Lord through heaven down to man by means of the Word. This is the reason why it is always provided by 
the Lord that there shall be a church on the earth, in which Divine truth may be in its ultimate. This is a secret as yet known to none, and which is meant by what was cited above (n. 9357, 9360). Let 
all therefore beware of injuring the Word in any way; for they who injure it, injure the Divine Itself. </p>

'And the cloud covered it' means the lowest level of the Word, which is obscure, comparatively so. This is clear from the meaning of 'the cloud' as the lowest level of the Word or its literal sense, 
dealt with in the Preface to Genesis <a href="18.htm">18</a>, and in <a href="4060.htm">4060</a>, <a href="4391.htm">4391</a>, <a href="5922.htm">5922</a>, <a href="6343.htm">6343</a> (end), <a href="6752.htm">6752</a>, <a href="8106.htm">8106</a>, <a href="8443.htm">8443</a>, <a href="8781.htm">8781</a>. The reason why that sense is called 'the cloud' is that it lies in obscurity, compared with the inward 
sense; for the inward sense dwells in the light of heaven. The outward lies in obscurity and resembles a cloud because it is intended for a person while in the world, whereas the inward sense is 
intended for a person when he enters heaven. But it should be recognized that while a person is in the world he is at the same time guided by the inward sense of the Word if in faith and life he is guided 
by teachings of the Church which are authentic. For through those teachings the inward sense of the Word is inscribed at that time on both his understanding and his will, on his understanding through 
the faith he has and on his will through the life he leads. When such a person enters heaven he understands the Word solely according to its inward sense and ceases to know anything of its outward 
sense. This now seems to him to be like a cloud that swallows up rays of light it receives.  </p>
<p></p>
<p><b>[2]</b>
 The person now understands the Word, as has been said, according to its inward and not according to 
its outward sense. This is so because the Lord uses God's truth present with people in the world, which is the Word, to teach all who are in heaven, the reason for this being that those people live 
on the lowest level of order, and everything on interior levels ends in the lowest. The lowest is so to speak the support for the interior levels, which stand and rest on it. The Word in the letter is 
Divine Truth on the lowest level of order, in the same way as the natural and sensory level is the lowest level of order in members of the Church with whom Divine Truth is present. On this lowest level 
in them, as on that of the Word, interior levels terminate and rest. All this is like a house and its foundations. The actual house is heaven, and it is also Divine Truth there such as the Word is 
in its inward sense, while the foundations are the world and also Divine Truth there such as the Word is in its outward sense. Just as the house rests on its foundations, so too heaven rests on the Church, 
and consequently Divine Truth in heaven on Divine Truth on earth. For through the Word a continuous link exists from the Lord by way of heaven right down to people in the world. This is the reason 
why the Lord always provides for the existence of a Church on earth, where Divine Truth may exist on its lowest level. This is an arcanum unknown to anyone up to now, an arcanum implied in the matters 
introduced at <a href="9357.htm">9357</a> and <a href="9360.htm">9360</a>. Let everyone take care therefore not to damage the Word in any way; for those who damage it damage what is indeed Divine.  </p>

`Et obtexit eum nubes': quod significet ultimum Verbi, quod obscurum ita respective, constat ex significatione `nubis' quod sit ultimum Verbi seu ejus sensus litterae, de qua Praefatio ad Gen. xviii 
et n. 4060, 4391, 5922, 6343 fin., 6752, 8106, 8443, 8781; quod is sensus {1}vocetur `nubes,' est quia ille est in obscuro respective ad sensum internum, hic enim est in luce caeli; quod in obscuro sit 
et instar nubis, est quia est pro homine cum est in mundo, at sensus internus pro homine cum venit in caelum; sed sciendum quod homo cum in mundo est, simul in sensu interno Verbi sit, cum in genuina 
doctrina Ecclesiae quoad fidem et quoad vitam, nam per eam doctrinam tunc inscribitur sensus internus Verbi tam ejus intellectui quam voluntati, ejus intellectui per fidem, et ejus voluntati per vitam 
talis homo cum venit in caelum, prorsus non aliter capit Verbum quam secundum sensum ejus internum, et {2} nihil scit de sensu ejus externo; apparet hic ei tunc sicut nubes quae absorbet radios lucis 
suae 2 Dicitur quod homo tunc {3}capiat Verbum secundum sensum ejus internum, et non secundum sensum ejus externum; {4}quod ita sit, est quia omnes qui in caelo sunt instruuntur a Domino ex vero 
Divino quod apud hominem, ita ex Verbo; {5} causa est quia homo est in ultimo ordinis, et in ultimum desinunt omnia interiora; ultimum {6}est quasi suffulcimentum interioribus in quo haec subsistunt et 
quiescunt; Verbum in littera {7} est Divinum Verum in ultimo ordinis, similiter homo Ecclesiae apud quem est Divinum Verum, quoad suum naturale et sensuale; in hoc sicut in illo interiora terminantur 
et quiescunt; se habent illa sicut domus et ejus fundamentum; ipsa domus est caelum, et ibi Divinum Verum quale est Verbum in sensu interno, et {8} fundamentum est mundus et ibi Divinum Verum quale 
est Verbum in sensu externo; sicut domus super fundamento suo {9}quiescit, ita quoque caelum super Ecclesia, proinde Divinum Verum in caelo super Divino Vero in terra; nexus enim continuus est a Domino 
per caelum usque ad hominem per Verbum; ea causa est quod semper provideatur a Domino ut in terra sit Ecclesia, ubi Divinum Verum sit in suo ultimo {10}.  Hoc arcanum est quod {11}nemo adhuc scit, et 
quod intelligitur per illa quae n. 9357 et 9360 allata sunt.  Caveant itaque sibi omnes ne Verbum ullo modo laedant, nam qui id laedunt ipsum Divinum laedunt. @1 dicatur$ @2 i prorsus$ @3 After internum$ @4
