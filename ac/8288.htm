<h3 align="center" class="ired">属天的奥秘 第8288节</h3>
<h4 align="center"></h4><p><strong>8288.</strong>“深渊凝结于海心”表属自我之爱的欲望的邪恶所生纯粹的虚假无法浮到表面。这从“凝结”、“深渊”和“海心”的含义清楚可知：当论及地狱里的那些人时，“凝结”是指无法浮到表面；“深渊”是指恶欲所带来的虚假，也指地狱（参看<a href="8278.htm">8278</a>，<a href="8279.htm">8279</a>节）；“海心”是指自我之爱的邪恶和由这邪恶所生的虚假。“心”在正面意义上表示属天良善，也就是对主之爱的良善（<a href="3635.htm">3635</a>，<a href="3883.htm">3883</a>-<a href="3895.htm">3895</a>，<a href="7542.htm">7542</a>节），在反面意义上表示自我之爱的邪恶。因为这邪恶是对主之爱的良善的对立面，尘世之爱的邪恶是属灵良善，就是对邻之爱的良善的对立面。由此明显可知，“深渊凝结于海心”表示属于自我之爱的欲望的邪恶所生的纯粹虚假不可能浮到表面。之所以说它们不可能浮到表面，是历为“深渊”和“海心”表示恶欲所带来的虚假，或邪恶所生的虚假所在的地狱。结果，他们在那里被其邪恶所生的虚假包围，故再也无法爬上去，因为主的神性拦阻了那里的虚假。</p>

The abysses were congealed in the heart of the sea. That this signifies that mere falsities from the evil of the cupidities of the love of self could not possibly emerge, is evident from the signification 
of "being congealed," when said of those who are in the hells, as not being able to emerge; from the signification of "the abysses," as being falsities from cupidities and as being the hells (see 
n. 8278, 8279); and from the signification of "the heart of the sea," as being the evil of the love of self and the derivative falsities. For in the genuine sense "the heart" signifies celestial good, 
which is of love to the Lord (n. 3635, 3883-3895, 7542), consequently in the opposite sense it signifies the evil of the love of self, for this evil is opposite to the good of love to the Lord, and 
the evil of the love of the world is opposite to spiritual good, which is of love toward the neighbor. From this it is plain that by "the abysses were congealed in the heart of the sea," is signified 
that mere falsities from the evil of the cupidities of the love of self could not possibly emerge. It is said that they could not emerge, because by "abysses," and by "the heart of the sea," are signified 
the hells where are falsities from cupidities, or where are falsities from evil; consequently, as they are there surrounded by their falsities from evil, they cannot any longer climb up, because 
the Divine of the Lord withstands the falsities there. </p>

<p align="center"><b>Elliott(1983-1999) 8288</b></p><p><b>8288.</b>
'The depths were congealed in the heart of the sea' means that utter falsities arising from evil belonging to the desires of self-love could not rise to the surface. This is clear from the meaning of 
'being congealed', when those in the hells are the subject, as being unable to rise to the surface; from the meaning of 'the depths' as falsities resulting from evil desires, and as the hells, dealt 
with above in <a href="8278.htm">8278</a>, <a href="8279.htm">8279</a>; and from the meaning of 'the heart of the sea' as the evil of self-love and the falsities arising from that evil. 'The heart' in the genuine sense means celestial good, which 
is the good of love to the Lord, spoken of in <a href="3635.htm">3635</a>, <a href="3883.htm">3883</a>-<a href="3896.htm">3896</a>, <a href="7542.htm">7542</a>, and in the contrary sense the evil of self-love. For this evil is the opposite of the good of love to the Lord, while the evil of 
the love of the world is the opposite of spiritual good, which is the good of love towards the neighbour. From all this it is evident that 'the depths were congealed in the heart of the sea' means that 
utter falsities arising from evil belonging to the desires of self-love could not rise to the surface. They are spoken of as being unable to rise to the surface because 'the depths' and 'the heart of 
the sea' mean the hells where falsities resulting from evil desires are, or where falsities arising from evil are. Consequently, since they are hemmed in by their own falsities arising from evil, they 
can no longer work their way out, because the Lord's Divine presence stands in the way of the falsities there. </p>

`Congelatae abyssi in corde maris': quod significet quod merae falsitates ex malo cupiditatum amoris sui nequicquam possent {1}emergere, constat ex significatione `congelatae esse,' cum de illis qui 
in infernis, quod (x)sit non posse emergere {2}; ex significatione `abyssorum' quod sint falsitates ex cupiditatibus, et quod sint inferna, de qua supra n. 8278, 8279; et ex significatione `cordis maris' 
quod sit malum amoris sui et inde falsa; `cor' enim in genuino sensu significat bonum caeleste, quod est amoris in Dominum, de quo n. 3635, 3883-3896, 7542, inde in opposito sensu malum amoris sui, 
nam hoc malum oppositum est bono amoris in Dominum, et malum amoris mundi oppositum est bono spirituali, quod est amoris erga proximum; exinde patet quod per `congelatae abyssi in corde maris' significentur 
(x)merae falsitates ex malo cupiditatum amoris sui, quod nequicquam possent emergere.  Quod non possint emergere, dicitur quia per `abyssos' et per `cor maris' significantur inferna ubi falsitates 
ex cupiditatibus, {3}sive ubi falsa ex malo; inde, quia ibi a suis falsis a malo circumstipati sunt, non amplius possunt eniti, quia falsis ibi obstat Divinum Domini. 	@1 immergere I$ 	@2 i, 
nam quae congelatae sunt in maribus ibi permanent nec emergunt$ 	@3 unde non emergere amplius possunt, nam detinentur illi qui ibi a suis falsis a malo circumstipati$ </p>
