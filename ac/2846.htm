<h3 align="center" class="ired">属天的奥秘 第2846节</h3>
<h4 align="center"></h4><p><strong>2846.</strong>“论福，我必赐福给你”表凭对真理的情感结硕果。这从“赐福”的含义清楚可知，“赐福”是指富有属天和属灵的良善（参看<a href="981.htm">981</a>，<a href="1096.htm">1096</a>，<a href="1420.htm">1420</a>，<a href="1422.htm">1422</a>节）；在此是指富有信之良善，或也可说，富有对真理的情感，因为所论述的是属灵之人。在本节，耶和华对亚伯拉罕说：“论福，我必赐福给你”，亚伯拉罕代表主的神性人，如本章前面所述。主自己不可能被赐福，因为祂是赐福本身；但当按照祂爱的渴望，得救的人数有很多时，经上就说祂被赐福；因此，就内义而言，此处所表示的正是这些人，这也可从接下来的事明显看出来。此处之所以用“结出硕果”这个词，是因为这论及情感；而如下文中“繁多”这个词则论及源于这情感的真理。</p>

That in blessing I will bless thee. That this signifies fructification from the affection of truth, is evident from the signification of "being blessed," as meaning to be enriched with celestial and 
spiritual good (see n. 981, 1096, 1420, 1422); here, to be made fruitful from the good of faith, or what is the same, from the affection of truth, because the spiritual are treated of. It is here said 
by Jehovah to Abraham, "in blessing I will bless thee," and by Abraham is represented the Lord as to His Divine Human, as before in this chapter; and yet the Lord Himself could not be blessed, because 
He is blessing itself; but He is said to be blessed, when in accordance with His love those abound who are saved; and therefore in the internal sense these are here signified, as is also evident from 
what immediately follows. Fructification is here spoken of, because this is predicated of affection; but multiplication, as next follows, is predicated of the truths which are therefrom. </p>

<p align="center"><b>Elliott(1983-1999) 2846</b></p><p><b>2846.</b>
'I will certainly bless you' means fruitfulness by virtue of the affection for truth. This is clear from the meaning of 'being blessed' as being enriched with celestial and spiritual good, dealt with 
in <a href="981.htm">981</a>, <a href="1096.htm">1096</a>, <a href="1420.htm">1420</a>, <a href="1422.htm">1422</a> - here, being enriched with good that is the product of faith, or what amounts to the same, with the affection for truth, for those who are spiritual are the subject. In this 
verse where Jehovah says to Abraham, 'I will certainly bless you', Abraham represents the Lord as regards the Divine Human, as he has done already in this chapter. The Lord Himself was not able to be 
blessed as He is Blessing itself; but the verb 'to be blessed' is used when, as His love desires, the number of those who are being saved is abounding, and therefore in the internal sense it is these 
that are meant here, as is clear also from the things that follow next. The expression 'fruitfulness' is employed here because it is said in reference to affection, whereas the expression 'multiplying', 
as in what follows, has reference to truths derived from that affection. </p>

<p align="center"><b>Latin(1748-1756) 2846</b>
</p><b>2846.</b>
Quod `benedicendo benedicam tibi' significet fructificationem ex affectione veri, constat a significatione `benedici' quod sit locupletari bono caelesti et spirituali, de qua n. 981, 1096, 1420, 1422, 
hic fructificari ex bono fidei, seu quod idem, ex affectione veri, quia de spiritualibus agitur.  Hic a Jehovah ad Abrahamum dicitur `benedicendo benedicam tibi,' et per `Abrahamum' repraesentatur 
Dominus quoad Divinum Humanum, ut in hoc capite prius; Ipse Dominus non potuit benedici quia est ipsa Benedictio; sed benedici dicitur cum secundum Ipsius amorem abundant illi qui salvantur, quare in 
sensu interno illi hic significantur, ut quoque constat ab iis quae immediate sequuntur: `fructificatio' hic dicitur, quia haec praedicatur de affectione, `multiplicatio' autem, ut sequitur, de veris 
quae inde. </p>
