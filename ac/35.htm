<h4 align="center"></h4><p><strong>35.</strong>人有两大本能，一为意志，一为觉性。当意志主导觉性，两者就合为一个心智，表现一个生命。彼时，人的所志所行也是他的所思所念。反之，若觉性与意志冲突，行为与信仰抵触，心智就一分为二，一部分求生天堂，一部分倾向地狱。由于意志驱动一切，若非主的慈悲，他整个人必一头栽入地狱。</p>

Cooper(2008,2013)</b></p>
<p><strong>[NCE]35.</strong> Humans have two basic faculties: will and intellect. When the will regulates the intellect, the two together make one mind and as a result one life; under those circumstances, what we will and do is also what we think and intend. When the intellect is at odds with the will, though, as when we act in a way that contradicts what we claim to believe, our single mind is torn in two. One part wants to rise up to heaven while the other leans toward hell. And since the will drives everything, we would rush into hell heart and soul if the Lord did not take pity on us. </p>
<p align="center"><b>Potts(1905-1910) 35</b></p><p><b>35.</b>
Man has two faculties: will and understanding. When the understanding is governed by the will they together constitute one mind, and thus one life, for then what the man wills and does he also thinks 
and intends. But when the understanding is at variance with the will (as with those who say they have faith, and yet live in contradiction to faith), then the one mind is divided into two, one of which 
desires to exalt itself into heaven, while the other tends toward hell; and since the will is the doer in every act, the whole man would plunge headlong into hell if it were not that the Lord has mercy on him. </p>

<p align="center"><b>Elliott(1983-1999) 35</b></p><p><b>35.</b>
Man has two inherent powers of will and understanding. When the understanding is governed by the will they then constitute one mind and so one life; for what a person in that case wills and does he also 
thinks and intends. But when the understanding is at variance with the will, as it is with people who claim to have faith and yet live otherwise, then a mind previously one is split in two. One half 
seeks to transport itself into heaven, while the other inclines towards hell. And because the will is what accomplishes everything, the whole man would rush straight into hell unless the Lord took 
pity on him.  </p>

<p align="center"><b>Latin(1748-1756) 35</b>
</p><b>35.</b>
Homini binae facultates sunt, voluntas et intellectus; cum intellectus regitur a voluntate, tunc simul unam mentem sic unam vitam constituunt, nam tunc quod homo vult et agit, etiam cogitat et intendit; 
cum autem intellectus dissidet a voluntate, sicut apud eos qui fidem se habere dicunt sed aliter vivunt, tunc una mens in binas distrahitur; una vult se auferre in caelum, altera tendit ad infernum; 
et quia voluntas omne agit, totus quantus ad infernum rueret nisi Dominus ejus misereretur. </p>
