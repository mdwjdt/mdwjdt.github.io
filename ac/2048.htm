<h3 align="center" class="ired">属天的奥秘 第2048节</h3>
<h4 align="center"></h4><p><strong>2048.</strong>“家里生的”表那些属天之人，“用银子买来的”表那些属灵之人，因而表那些教会内的人。这从“家里生的”的含义清楚可知，“家里生的”是指那些在家里的人。在圣言中，“家”表属天之物，因为这是至内在的。所以，广义来说，“神的家”表主的国度，狭义来说，表教会，具体来说，表内有主国度或教会的这个人自己。当人被称作“家”时，它表示人里面信的属天一面；当他被称作“殿”时，它表示人里面的信之真理。因此，“家里生的”在此表属天之人。而“用银子买来的”表属灵之人，这一点从“银子”的含义清楚可知。“银子”是指真理，因而是指信的属灵一面（参看第一卷<a href="1551.htm">1551</a>节）。<br />那些由对主之爱所主导的人被称为属天的，大洪水前的上古教会就被这种爱所主导，故它是属天教会。那些由对邻之爱、因而由信之真理所主导的人被称为属灵的，这是大洪水后古教会的特征。属天的和属灵的之间的区别在第一卷多次予以论述。谁都能看出，此处，也就是那些家里生的，用银子买的，还有外人都要受割礼的要求，以及他们被重复提及（如接下来的13，23，27节）的事实蕴含天堂的奥秘。然而，这些奥秘只能通过内义才能显明，也就是说，那些家里生的和用银子买的表示属天之人和属灵之人，因而表示那些教会内的人。而“不属于你种的外人”则表示那些教会外的人。</p>

That "he that is born in the house" signifies those who are celestial, and that "he that is bought with silver" signifies those who are spiritual, and that they thus signify those who are within the 
church, is evident from the signification of one "born in the house," as being those who are within the house. A "house," in the Word, signifies what is celestial, because this is the inmost; whence by 
the "house of God" in a universal sense is signified the Lord's kingdom; in a sense less universal, His church; and in a particular sense, the man himself in whom there is the Lord's kingdom or church. 
When man is called a "house," the celestial of faith in him is signified; and when he is called a "temple," the truth of faith in him is signified; thus here by one "born in the house" those who are 
celestial are signified. But that "he that is bought with silver" signifies those who are spiritual, is evident from the signification of "silver," as being truth, thus the spiritual of faith (see 
Part First, n. 1551).  [2] Those are called celestial who are in love to the Lord; and as the Most Ancient Church, which was before the flood, was in this love, it was a celestial church. Those are called 
spiritual who are in love toward the neighbor and thereby in the truth of faith, as was the Ancient Church, which was after the flood. The distinction between the celestial and the spiritual has 
been treated of many times in Part First. Everyone can see that there are heavenly arcana in what is here said, namely, that those born in the house were to be circumcised, and those bought with silver, 
and also the sons that were strangers; and also from their being repeatedly mentioned (as in verses 13, 23, and 27, which follow); which arcana do not appear except from the internal sense, which 
shows that by those born in the house and those bought with silver are signified the celestial and the spiritual, thus those who are within the church; and that by "a son that is a stranger who is not 
of thy seed" are signified those who are outside the church. </p>

<p align="center"><b>Elliott(1983-1999) 2048</b></p><p><b>2048.</b>
That 'he who is born in the houses means celestial people, and 'he who is the purchase of silver' spiritual people, and so those who are inside the Church, is clear from the meaning of 'him born in the 
house' as those inside the house. In the Word 'a house' means that which is celestial because this is inmost. Consequently 'the house of God' means in the universal sense the Lord's kingdom, in a less 
universal sense the Church, and in a particular sense the individual himself in whom the Lord's kingdom or Church exists. When a person is called 'a house' it means the celestial side of faith with 
him, but when he is called 'a temple' it means the truth of faith with him. So 'he who is born in the house' here means celestial people. That 'the purchase of silver' or one bought with silver means 
spiritual people however is clear from the meaning of 'silver' as truth, and so the spiritual side of faith, dealt with in Volume One, in <a href="1551.htm">1551</a>. </p>
<p></p>
<p><b>[2]</b>
 The expression celestial is used of those who are 
governed by love to the Lord, and because the Most Ancient Church which existed before the Flood was governed by that love it was a celestial Church. The expression spiritual is used of those who are 
governed by love towards the neighbour and so by the truth of faith. This was the character of the Ancient Church that existed after the Flood. The difference between celestial people and spiritual 
has been dealt with many times in Volume One. Anyone may see that there are heavenly arcana here, that is to say, in the requirement to circumcise those born in the house and those bought with silver, 
also sons who were foreigners, and in the fact that those persons are mentioned repeatedly, for example, in verses 13, 23, 27, that follow. These arcana are not apparent however except from the internal 
sense, that is to say, that those born in the house and those bought with silver mean celestial people and spiritual, and so those inside the Church - while 'the son who is a foreigner and not of 
your seed' means those outside the Church. </p>

Quod `natus domus' significet caelestes et quod `emptio `argenti' significet spirituales, ita qui intra Ecclesiam, constat a significatione `nati domus' quod sint illi qui intra domum, `domus' in Verbo 
significat caeleste, quia hoc intimum, unde per `domum Dei' significatur in universali sensu regnum Domini, in minus universali, Ecclesia, in particulari, ipse homo in quo est regnum seu Ecclesia 
Domini; quando homo dicitur `domus,' significatur caeleste fidei apud eum, quando `templum,' significatur verum fidei apud eum; ita hic per `natum domus' significantur {1} caelestes.  Quod autem `emptio 
argenti' seu `emptus argento' significet spirituales, constat ex significatione `argenti' quod sit verum, ita spirituale fidei, de qua in Parte Prima n. 1551: [2] caelestes dicuntur qui sunt in amore 
in Dominum, et quia Antiquissima Ecclesia quae ante diluvium, in illo amore fuit, erat Ecclesia caelestis: spirituales dicuntur qui in amore {2} erga proximum, et sic in vero fidei: talis fuit Antiqua 
Ecclesia quae post diluvium; de distinctione inter caelestes et spirituales pluries actum est in Parte Prima.  Quisque videre potest quod hic arcana caelestia sint, nempe quod circumcidendi essent 
nati domus et empti argento, tum quoque filii alienigenae, et quod illi {3} nominentur, et hoc aliquoties, ut in vers. seq. 13, 23, 27, quae arcana non patent nisi ex sensu interno, nempe quod per `natos 
domus' et `emptos argento' significentur caelestes et spirituales, ita qui intra Ecclesiam, et per `filium alienigenam qui non e semine,' illi qui extra Ecclesiam. 	@1 intelliguntur.$ 	@2 charitate.$ 	@3 hi.$ </p>
