<h3 align="center" class="ired">属天的奥秘 第418节</h3>
<h4 align="center"></h4><p><strong>418.</strong>上一节讨论了爱的属天事物，这一节要讨论信的属灵事物，它们用“竖琴和风琴”来表述。诸如竖琴之类的弦乐器表信的属灵事物，这一点从很多观点清楚可知。在代表性教会的敬拜中，类似的乐器以及唱歌无非代表这些事物。正是由于这个缘故，才会有如此多的歌者和乐师，具有这种代表性的原因是，一切天堂喜乐都会产生内心的欢乐，表达这欢乐的方式是唱歌，其次是配合和提升歌声的弦乐器。内心的每种情感都能引发歌声以及伴随这歌声的东西。内心的情感是属天的，但由此发出的歌声是属灵的。<br />唱歌及其类似方式表属灵之物，这一点已通过天堂的唱诗班向我显明，唱诗班有两类：属天和属灵。从属天的唱诗班很容易区分出属灵的唱诗班，因为他们充满活力的歌声好比弦乐器的声音，对此，蒙主怜悯，容后再述。上古之人将属天之物归于心，将属灵之物归于肺，并随之归于凡与肺相关的事物，如歌声之类的，因此还包括这些乐器的音或声。它们有这样的联系，不仅因为心与肺代表一种婚姻，好比爱与信的婚姻，还因为属天天使属于心的区域，而属灵天使则属于肺的区域。上述经文就表示这类事物，这一点也可从以下事实得知，即这是主的圣言，如果仅仅包含犹八是弹奏竖琴和风琴者之父这样的信息，那么这句经文毫无生命可言，并且知道这一点也没什么用处。</p>

<p><strong>[NCE]418.</strong> The last verse dealt with heavenly things, which belong to love. The current verse deals with spiritual things, which have to do with faith. These are expressed by the harp and organ.<br />The symbolism of stringed instruments — harps and the like — as the spiritual qualities of faith is evident from many things.<br />It is exactly what the same kind of instruments represented in the worship of the representative church, and what vocal music represented as well, which is why there were so many singers and musicians.{*1} The underlying reason is that all heavenly joy makes the heart cheerful, and the cheer was attested to in song that had string instruments added to echo and enhance it. All the heart's emotions carry with them the tendency to spill out in song and so in the accompaniment to a song. The feeling in the heart is heavenly in nature; the song it inspires is spiritual.<br />[2] The symbolism of songs and other kinds of music as something spiritual is clear to me from angel choirs, of which there are two kinds: heavenly and spiritual. The singing of the spiritual choirs has a sound reminiscent of [beating] wings that can be compared to the sound of stringed instruments, which makes it easy to distinguish them from heavenly choirs. (They will be described later, with the Lord's divine mercy.){*2} The earliest people, moreover, assigned anything of a heavenly nature to the heart's province and anything spiritual to the lungs' province. In this way they associated spirituality with any use of the lungs, such as for vocal music and so on; as a result they associated it with the "voices" or sounds of wind instruments. The reason was not only that the heart and lungs represent a kind of marriage, as love and faith do, but also that heavenly angels belong to the province of the heart and spiritual angels belong to that of the lungs.<br />The presence of these meanings in the current verse can also be seen from the consideration that the Word is the Lord's, but would be devoid of life if it were merely telling that Jubal was the father of those who play the harp and the organ. Nor would it be useful to anyone to know this.<br /><br /><strong>Footnotes:</strong><br />{*1} King David appointed 288 official musicians (<a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_418/bible_king-james-version_1-chronicles_25_7" target=_top>1 Chronicles 25:7</a>); see also <a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_418/bible_king-james-version_1-chronicles_9_33" target=_top>1 Chronicles 9:33</a>; <a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_418/bible_king-james-version_1-chronicles_15_16-22" target=_top>15:16-22</a>; <a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_418/bible_king-james-version_1-chronicles_25_1-31" target=_top>25:1-31</a>; <a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_418/bible_king-james-version_2-chronicles_5_12-13" target=_top>2 Chronicles 5:12-13</a>.

The former verse treated of celestial things which are of love, but this verse treats of spiritual things which are of faith, and these are expressed by the "harp and organ." That by stringed instruments, 
such as harps and the like, are signified the spiritual things of faith, is evident from many considerations. Similar instruments, and also the singing, in the worship of the representative church, 
represented nothing else, and it was on this account that there were so many singers and musicians, the cause of this representation being that all heavenly joy produces gladness of heart, which was 
expressed by singing, and in the next place by stringed instruments that emulated and exalted the singing. Every affection of the heart is attended with this: that it produces singing, and consequently 
what is connected with singing. The affection of the heart is celestial, but the consequent singing is spiritual. That singing and that which resembles it denote what is spiritual, has been evident 
to me from the angelic choirs, which are of two kinds, celestial and spiritual. The spiritual choirs are easily distinguished from the celestial by their vibrant singing tone [sono canoro alato], comparable 
to the sound of stringed instruments, of which, by the Divine mercy of the Lord, we shall speak hereafter. The most ancient people referred what was celestial to the province of the heart, and 
what was spiritual to that of the lungs, and consequently to whatever pertains to the lungs, as do the singing voice and things like it, and therefore the voices or sounds of such instruments. The 
ground of this was not merely that the heart and lungs represent a kind of marriage, like that of love and faith, but also because the celestial angels belong to the province of the heart, and the spiritual 
angels to that of the lungs. That such things are meant in the passage before us, may also be known from the fact that this is the Word of the Lord, and that it would be destitute of life if nothing 
more were implied than that Jubal was the father of such as play upon the harp and the organ; nor is it of any use to anyone to know this. </p>

The previous verse deals with celestial things, which are the attributes of love, the present verse with spiritual things, which are the attributes of faith. These spiritual things are portrayed as 'the 
harp and organ'. That stringed instruments, such as harps and others like them, meant the spiritual things of faith is clear from many points of view. In the worship of the representative Church instruments 
like these, and the singing likewise, had no other representation. This was why there were so many singers and musicians, the main reason for such representation being that all heavenly joy 
produces gladness of heart, which was expressed by means of singing, and subsequently by means of stringed instruments that strove to match the singing and uplifted it. Every affection of the heart also 
has this capacity to produce singing and therefore the things which go with singing. Affection of the heart is something celestial, singing issuing from it something spiritual.  </p>

<p><b>[2]</b>
 That singing 
and the like means that which is spiritual has also become clear to me from angelic choirs, of which there are two kinds, celestial and spiritual. From the vibrant quality of their singing, to which 
the sound of stringed instruments may be likened, spiritual choirs are readily distinguished from celestial choirs. This will in the Lord's Divine mercy be described later on. What is more, the most 
ancient people related that which was celestial to the province of the heart, and that which was spiritual to the province of the lungs. In so doing they related that which was spiritual to whatever involved 
the lungs, such as singing voices and other similar things, and so to the voices or sounds of such instruments. The reason for their so relating them was not only that the heart and lungs represent 
a kind of marriage, like that of love and faith, but also that celestial angels belong to the province of the heart whereas spiritual angels belong to that of the lungs. It can also be recognized 
that such considerations are meant here from the fact that this is the Word of the Lord, which would contain no life at all if its message were merely that Jubal was the father of those who play on 
harp and organ. Nor would any use be served in anyone's knowing it.  </p>

</p><b>418.</b>
In priore versu agitur de caelestibus quae sunt amoris; in hoc de spiritualibus quae sunt fidei; haec per 'citharam et organum' exprimuntur.  Quod per instrumenta chordacea, ut per citharas et similia, 
significata sint spiritualia fidei, multis constat. Instrumenta similia in cultu Ecclesiae repraesentativae nec aliud repraesentabant, similiter etiam cantus; inde tot cantores et musici, et quidem 
ex causa quod omne caeleste gaudium producit cordis laetitiam, quae testificata per cantum, et dein per instrumenta chordarum quae aemulabantur et exaltabant cantum; omnis affectio cordis hoc quoque 
secum habet quod producat cantum, proinde quae cantus sunt; affectio cordis est caeleste, cantus inde est spirituale. [2] Quod cantus et simile significet spirituale, etiam constare mihi potest a choris 
angelicis, qui duplicis generis sunt, caelestes et spirituales; spirituales chori ex eorum sono canoro alato, cui chordaceorum instrumentorum sonus assimilari potest, probe distincti sunt a caelestibus, 
de quibus, ex Divina Domini Misericordia, in sequentibus.  Antiquissimi etiam, quod caeleste erat, referebant ad cordis provinciam et quod spirituale, ad pulmonum; ita spirituale ad quaecumque 
pulmonum sunt, ut voces cantus et quae similia, sic ad voces seu sonos talium instrumentorum; ex causa non solum quia cor et pulmones quoddam conjugium repraesentant sicut amor et fides, sed etiam quia 
caelestes angeli ad provinciam cordis, spirituales vero angeli ad pulmonum pertinent. Quod talia hic intelligantur, etiam potest sciri ex eo quod Verbum Domini sit, in quo nulla vita foret si modo narraretur 
quod Jubal esset pater pulsantium citharam et organum; nec alicui usui hoc scire. </p>
