<h3 align="center" class="ired">属天的奥秘 第3336节</h3>
<h4 align="center"></h4><p><strong>3336.</strong>“以扫轻看长子的名分”表与此同时，生活的良善根本不重视优先权。这从“轻看”和“长子的名分”的含义，以及“以扫”的代表清楚可知：“轻看”是指根本不重视；“以扫”是指生活的良善（<a href="3300.htm">3300</a>，<a href="3322.htm">3322</a>节）；“长子的名分”是指优先权（<a href="3325.htm">3325</a>节）。这是指在此期间，或短期内（<a href="3324.htm">3324</a>，<a href="3325.htm">3325</a>，<a href="3330.htm">3330</a>节）。由此明显可知，“以扫轻看长子的名分”表示在此期间，生活的良善根本不重视优先权。要理解本章所讲有关以扫和雅各的这些事的内义，思维必须完全从历史事件、因而从以扫和雅各这些人物那里移开，取而代之的是，必须专注于它们所代表的事物，也就是说，专注于属世人的良善及其真理；或也可说，专注于正通过真理与良善重生的属灵之人。因为就圣言的内义而言，名字无非表示真实事物。当所思想的是属世人的良善及其真理，而非以扫和雅各时，那么人通过真理与良善重生的方式就显而易见了，也就是说，一开始，他所具有的真理看似占据在先和更高的位置，而事实上，良善本身才是在先和更高的。<br />为清楚表明哪一个在先和更高，是真理还是良善，我们在此进一步作以简要说明。不难看出，没有什么东西能进入人的记忆并留在那里，除非有吸引它的某种情感或爱。没有情感，或也可说，没有爱，就没有任何洞察。所进入的事物与这情感或爱联结，并且一旦联结，就保留下来。这从以下事实明显看出来：当类似情感或爱返回时，事物本身也会重现，并连同以前凭类似情感或爱所进入的其它事物一起呈为可见；这一过程反复进行。人的思维由此而来，他的言谈则由思维而来。同样，当事物本身返回时，无论这种返回是通过感官对象，还是思维对象，或另一人的言谈实现的，该事物进入时所带有的情感就会再现。这是经验的教导，只要停下来反思一下，谁都能确认这一点。<br />真理的教义事物以同样的方式进入记忆，最初引入它们的事物就是属于各种爱的情感，如前所述（<a href="3330.htm">3330</a>节）。尽管那时属于仁之善的真正情感没有被认出来，但它仍就在场。它越能在场，就越被主联结于真理的教义事物，它们也越能保持联结。因此，当此人能重生的时刻到来时，主就激发良善的情感，并通过这情感唤起被祂联结于该情感的事物。在圣言中，这些事物被称为“余留”。那时，凭着这情感，即良善的情感，主逐渐移除其它爱的情感，从而也移除与它们联结的事物。对良善的情感，或也可说，生活的良善就是以这种方式开始拥有统治权。其实它以前就拥有这统治权，只是无法显现给此人。因为人越处于对自我和尘世之爱，属于真爱的良善就越不明显。由此可见，所讲有关以扫和雅各的这些历史细节在内义上表示什么。 </p>

And Esau despised the birthright. That this signifies that in the meantime the good of life made no account of the priority, is evident from the signification of "despising," as being to make no account 
of; from the representation of Esau, as being the good of life (n. 3300, 3322); and from the signification of "birthright," as being priority (n. 3325). That it is in the meantime, or for a time, 
may be seen above (n. 3324, 3325, 3330). Hence it is manifest that by "Esau despising the birthright" is signified that in the meantime the good of life made no account of the priority. In order that 
what is related in this chapter concerning Esau and Jacob may be apprehended in regard to its signification in the internal sense, the thought must be removed entirely from the historicals, thus from 
the persons of Esau and Jacob; and instead of them must be substituted the things they represent, namely, the good of the natural and its truth; or what is the same, the spiritual man who is being regenerated 
by means of truth and good; for in the internal sense of the Word names signify nothing else than actual things. When the good of the natural and its truths are thought of instead of Esau and 
Jacob, it is then evident how the case is with man's regeneration by means of truth and good, namely, that in the beginning truth apparently has the priority with him, and also the superiority, although 
in itself good is prior and superior.  [2] In order that it may be still more clearly evident how the case is with this priority and superiority, something further shall be said. It is easy to see 
that nothing can possibly enter into man's memory and remain there, unless there is a certain affection or love which introduces it. If there is no affection, or what is the same, no love, there will 
be no observation. It is this affection, or love, with which the thing that enters connects itself, and being connected remains; as is evident from the fact that when a similar affection or love returns, 
the thing itself recurs, and is presented to view along with other things that had before entered by virtue of a similar affection or love; and this in a series. From this comes man's thought; and 
from this thought his speech. In like manner also when the thing itself returns, if this is effected by objects of the senses, or by objects of the thought, or by the discourse of another, the affection 
also with which the thing had entered is reproduced. This is the teaching of experience, and on reflection everyone may be confirmed in it. [3] The doctrinal things of truth enter in like manner 
into the memory; and the things that at first introduce them are affections of various loves, as before said (n. 3330). Genuine affection, which is of the good of charity, is not then observed; but 
still it is present; and so far as it can be present, it is adjoined by the Lord to the doctrinal things of truth; and so far also they remain adjoined. When therefore the time comes that the man can 
be regenerated, the Lord inspires the affection of good, and through this excites the things which have been adjoined by Him to this affection, which things are called in the Word "remains;" and then 
by means of this affection (that is, of the affection of good), by successive steps the Lord removes the affections of other loves, consequently also the things that have been connected with them. And 
thus the affection of good, or what is the same, the good of life, begins to have the dominion. It indeed had the dominion before, but this could not appear to the man; for insofar as a man is in the 
love of self and of the world, the good which is of genuine love does not appear. From this it may now be seen what is signified in the internal sense by the things historically related concerning Esau 
and Jacob. </p>

'And Esau despised the birthright' means that the good of life did not in the meantime attach any importance at all to priority of place. This is clear from the meaning of 'despising' as attaching no 
importance at all, from the representation of 'Esau' as the good of life, dealt with in <a href="3300.htm">3300</a>, <a href="3322.htm">3322</a>, and from the meaning of 'the birthright' as that which has priority of place, dealt with in <a href="3325.htm">3325</a>. That 
in the meantime or in the short term is meant, see <a href="3324.htm">3324</a>, <a href="3325.htm">3325</a>, <a href="3330.htm">3330</a>. From this it is evident that 'Esau despised the birthright' means that the good of life did not in the meantime attach any importance 
at all to priority of place. To grasp what is meant in the internal sense by these things that have been stated in this chapter regarding Esau and Jacob one's thought has to be removed completely 
from historical events, and so from the persons Esau and Jacob, and to be focused instead on the things which they represent, that is to say, on the good of the natural and its truth, or what amounts 
to the same, on the spiritual man, who is regenerated by means of truth and good. For in the internal sense of the Word names mean nothing other than real things When the good of the natural and its 
truth are held in mind instead of Esau and Jacob, the manner in which a person is regenerated by means of truth and good is then evident, that is to say, how at first truth residing with him apparently 
occupies the prior and also higher position, when in fact good in itself is the prior and higher. </p>
<p></p>
<p><b>[2]</b>
 To make it quite clear which one is prior to and higher than the other - truth or good - let 
a further brief comment be made. It is probably well known that nothing is ever able to enter the human memory and remain there unless there is some affection or love to attract it. If there were no 
affection, or what amounts to the same, no love, there would not be any discernment It is to this affection or love to which the thing entering in links itself, and once linked to that affection it remains. 
This becomes clear from the consideration that when a like affection or love returns that thing reappears as well, presenting itself together with many others which, from a like affection or love, 
have entered in previously. This goes on repeatedly. This is the origin of a person's thought, and from his thought, of his speech. It is similar also when a thing returns, whether it is the objects 
of the senses, or the objects of thought, or the speech of another that causes it to return, then the affection also with which the thing had entered in is reproduced. This is something which experience 
teaches, and anyone may confirm it for himself if he stops to reflect </p>
<p></p>
<p><b>[3]</b>
 Matters of doctrine concerning truth as well enter the memory in a similar way and in the earliest stages it is the affections 
belonging to varying loves that bring them in, as stated above in <a href="3330.htm">3330</a>. Genuine affection which belongs to the good of charity, though not recognized at that time, is nevertheless present. And 
to the extent it is able to be present it is allied to matters of doctrine concerning truth from the Lord and also remains allied When the time comes therefore when a person is able to be regenerated 
the Lord inspires the affection for good, and through that affection arouses the things that have been allied to that affection from Himself. In the Word these things are called remnants In that case 
by means of that affection for good the affections belonging to other loves are gradually removed, and so also are the things which have been linked to them. In this way the affection for good, or 
what amounts to the same, the good of life, starts to have dominion. It also had dominion before this but that could not be seen by the person himself, for to the extent someone is ruled by self-love 
and love of the world the good that belongs to genuine love is not apparent. From this one may now see what is meant in the internal sense by the historical details that have been told regarding Esau 
and Jacob. </p>

`Et contempsit Esau primogenituram': quod significet quod bonum vitae nihili fecerit interea prioritatem, constat a significatione `contemnere' quod sit nihili facere; a repraesentatione `Esavi' quod 
sit bonum vitae, de qua n. 3300, 3322; et a significatione `primogeniturae' quod sit prioritas, de qua n. 3325; quod sit interea seu quoad tempus, videatur n. 3324, 3325, 3330; inde patet quod per `contempsit 
Esau primogenituram' significetur quod bonum vitae nihili fecerit prioritatem interea.  Ut haec quae in hoc capite de Esavo et Jacobo dicta sunt, capiantur quid in sensu interno significant, 
removenda est prorsus cogitatio ab historicis, ita a personis Esavi et Jacobi, et loco {1}illorum substituenda illa quae repraesentant, nempe bonum naturalis et verum ejus, seu quod idem, homo spiritualis, 
qui per verum et bonum regeneratur; nomina enim in sensu interno Verbi nihil aliud significant quam res; cum bonum naturalis et verum ejus, loco Esavi et Jacobi, capiuntur, tunc patet quomodo 
se habet cum regeneratione hominis per verum et bonum, quod nempe principio verum apud illum prioritatem et quoque superioritatem habeat apparenter, tametsi bonum in se prius et superius est. [2] Ut evidentius 
pateat quomodo cum prioritate et superioritate illa se habet, paucis adhuc dicendum: notum esse potest quod nihil usquam intrare possit in memoriam hominis (c)et ibi remanere nisi sit affectio 
quaedam seu amor qui inducit; si nulla affectio, seu quod idem, si nullus amor, non foret aliqua apperceptio; affectio illa seu amor ille est cum quo res quae intrat, se copulat, et copulata remanet; 
ut constare potest ex eo quod quando similis affectio seu amor redit, res illa recurrat et sistatur praesens cum pluribus quae ex simili affectione seu amore prius intrarunt, et hoc in serie; inde 
cogitatio et ex cogitatione loquela hominis; (m)similiter etiam cum res redit, si hoc fiat ex objectis sensuum, vel ex objectis cogitationis, vel ex loquela alius, etiam affectio cum qua res intraverat, 
reproducitur; hoc experientia docet, et quilibet in hoc confirmari potest, si reflectit:(n) [3] doctrinalia veri intrant quoque similiter in memoriam, et quae primis temporibus inferunt illa, sunt 
affectiones variorum amorum, ut supra n. 3330 dictum; affectio genuina quae est boni charitatis, non tunc appercipitur, sed usque adest, et quantum illa potest adesse, adjungitur doctrinalibus veri a 
Domino, et tantum quoque remanent adjuncta: cum itaque tempus venit ut regenerari possit homo, tunc Dominus inspirat affectionem bona, et per illam excitat res quae affectioni illi ab Ipso adjunctae sunt, 
quae res vocantur in Verbo reliquiae, et tunc per illam, nempe affectionem boni, removet affectiones aliorum amorum successive, proinde etiam res quae cum illis copulatae fuerunt; ac ita dominari 
incipit affectio boni, seu quod idem, bonum vitae; dominium quoque prius habuit, sed hoc non homini potuit apparere, nam quantum homo in amore sui et mundi est, tantum non apparet bonum quod est genuini 
amoris: inde nunc constare potest quid per illa in sensu interno quae de Esavo et Jacobo historice relata sunt, significantur. </p>
