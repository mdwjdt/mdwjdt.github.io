<h4 align="center"></h4><p><strong>9122.</strong>那些在世上没有获得良心的人在来世不可能获得良心。因此，他们不可能得救，因为他们没有任何层面使得天堂，也就是主经由天堂能够流入并可以运作于其上，从而把他们吸引到自己这里，或说，没有一块建在他们里面的田地使得天使，也就是主经由天堂能进入并作用于其上，以便祂可以把他们吸引自己这里来。因为良心是天堂流注的层面和容器，或说是天堂得以进入的活动领域和容器。因此，在来世，像这样的人便与那些爱自己爱世界胜过一切的人联系在一起，或说进入他们的社群；这些人都在地狱。</p>

Those who have not received Conscience in the world cannot receive Conscience in the other life. Thus they cannot be saved, because they have no plane into which heaven (that is, the Lord through heaven) 
can flow, and whereby it may operate, and so draw them to itself; for Conscience is the plane and receptacle of the influx of heaven. Wherefore in the other life such persons are associated with 
those who love themselves and the world above all things; and these are in hell. </p>
<p>     EXODUS 22 </p>
<p>     1. (2)* If a thief be caught while digging through, and be smitten, and he die, bloods shall 
not be shed for him.      2. (3) If the sun have risen upon him, bloods shall be shed for him; repaying he shall repay; if he have nothing, he shall be sold for his theft.      3. (4) If finding the 
theft be found in his hand, from an ox even to an ass, even to one of the small cattle, living; he shall repay double.      4. (5) When a man shall desolate a field or a vineyard, and shall let his 
beast go in, and it shall desolate in the field of another; of the best of his own field, and of the best of his own vineyard, he shall repay.      5. (6) When a fire shall go forth, and shall catch 
hold of thorns, and a stack is consumed, or the standing crop, or a field; he that kindleth the fire repaying shall repay.      6. (7) When a man shall give to his companion silver or vessels to take 
care of, and it be stolen out of the man's house; if the thief be caught, he shall repay double.      7. (8) If the thief be not caught, the lord of the house shall be brought unto God, to see whether 
he hath put his hand to his companion's work.      8. (9) Upon every word of transgression, upon ox, upon ass, upon one of the small cattle, upon garment, upon every lost thing, whereof he shall say, 
This is it; even unto God shall come the word of them both; he whom God shall condemn shall repay double to his companion.      9. (10) When a man shall give to his companion an ass, or an ox, or 
one of the small cattle, or any beast, to take care of; and it die, or be broken, or be led away captive, no one seeing it; </p>
<p>     10. (11) The oath of Jehovah shall be between them both, to see whether 
he hath put his hand to his companion's work, or whether its lord hath taken it; and he shall not repay.      11. (12) And if stealing it shall be stolen from him, he shall repay to its lord.    
  12. (13) If tearing it shall be torn, he shall bring a witness for it; he shall not repay that which was torn.      13. (14) And when a man shall borrow from his companion, and it be broken, or die, 
the lord thereof not being with it, repaying he shall repay.      14. (15) If the lord thereof be with it, he shall not repay; if he is a hireling he shall come in his hire.      15. (16) And when 
a man shall persuade a virgin who is not betrothed, and shall lie with her, endowing he shall endow her to himself for a woman.      16. (17) If refusing her father shall refuse to give her to him, 
he shall pay silver according to the dowry of virgins.      17. (18) Thou shalt not suffer a sorceress to live.      18. (19) Everyone that lieth with a beast, dying he shall die.      19. (20) He 
that sacrificeth to gods, save to Jehovah alone, shall be accursed.      20. (21) And a sojourner thou shalt not afflict, and shall not oppress; for ye were sojourners in the land of Egypt.      21. 
(22) Any widow and orphan ye shall not afflict.      22. (23) If afflicting thou shalt afflict him, so that crying he shall cry unto Me, hearing I will hear his cry: </p>
<p>     23. (24) And Mine anger shall 
wax hot, and I will kill you with the sword; and your wives shall become widows, and your sons orphans.      24. (25) If thou shalt lend silver to My people, the needy with thee, thou shalt not be 
to him as a usurer; ye shall not put usury upon him.      25. (26) If taking a pledge thou shalt take in pledge thy companion's garment, even at the going in of the sun thou shalt restore it to him.  
    26. (27) For it is his only covering, it is his garment for his skin, wherein he may sleep; and it shall be, when he shall cry unto Me, that I will hear; for I am merciful.      27. (28) Thou 
shalt not curse God, and a prince in thy people thou shalt not execrate.      28. (29) The firstfruits of thy grain, and the firstfruits of thy wine, thou shalt not delay. The firstborn of thy sons 
thou shalt give to Me.      29. (30) So shalt thou do with thine ox, and with thy flock; seven days it shall be with its mother; on the eighth day thou shalt give it to Me.      30. (31) And ye shall 
be men of holiness to Me; and flesh that is torn in the field ye shall not eat; ye shall cast it to the dog. * The verses are numbered as in the Hebrew Bible; the figures in parentheses refer to the 
verses as numbered in the English Authorized Version. </p>

Those who have not acquired conscience in the world cannot acquire conscience in the next life. So they cannot be saved, since there is no field established in them for heaven to come into and act on, 
that is, for the Lord to do so through heaven, so that He may draw them to Himself. For conscience is the field of activity and receptacle for heaven to come into. Consequently in the next life people 
such as these pass into communities of those who love self and the world above all things, that is, who are in hell.  </p>

Qui conscientiam non receperunt in mundo, illi (t)conscientiam non recipere possunt in altera vita; ita non possunt salvari, quia illis non est planum in quod influat et per quod operetur caelum, hoc 
est, per caelum Dominus, et illos adducat ad se; nam conscientia est planum et receptaculum influxus caeli; quapropter tales in altera vita consociantur illis qui se et mundum super omnia amant, qui 
sunt in inferno. CAPUT XXII {1} @1 In AV the division of chapters is made at xxi 37$ 1.  Si in perfossione deprehensus fuerit fur, et percussus, et moriatur, non illi sanguines. 2.  Si exortus fuerit 
sol super eo, sanguines illi, rependendo rependet; si nihil illi, et vendetur pro furto suo. 3.  Si inveniendo inventum fuerit in manu illius furtum, a bove usque ad asinum, usque ad pecudem, viventes, 
duplum rependet. 4.  Quando desolaverit {1} vir agrum vel vineam, et immiserit jumentum suum, et desolaverit {1} in agro alterius, ex optimo agri sui et ex optimo vineae suae rependet. @1 (incendere, 
depascere) written above desolaverit$ 5.  Quando exiverit ignis, et apprehenderit spinas, et consumatur acervus, aut seges stans, aut ager rependendo rependet incendens incensum. 6.  Quando 
dederit vir socio suo argentum vel vasa ad custodiendum, et furto ablatum fuerit e domo viri, si deprehensus fur, rependet duplum. 7.  Si non deprehensus fur, adducetur dominus domus ad DEUM {1}, annon 
miserit manum (x)suam in opus socii sui. @1 In A deos is written above DEUM$ 8.  Super omni verbo praevaricationis, super bove, super asino, super pecude, super veste, super omni perdito, quod 
dixerit quod hoc illud, usque ad DEUM veniet verbum amborum illorum, quem condemnaverint DEUS, rependet duplum socio suo. 9.  Quando dederit vir socio suo asinum, vel bovem, vel pecudem, et omnem bestiam 
ad custodiendum, et moriatur aut frangatur, aut captivum abducatur, nemine vidente, 10.  Juramentum JEHOVAE erit inter ambos illos, annon miserit manum suam in opus socii sui, et sumpserit dominus 
ejus, et non rependet. 11.  Et si furando furto ablatum fuerit ab illo, rependet domino ejus. 12.  Si discerpendo discerptum fuerit, adducet illi testem, discerptum non rependet. 13.  Et quando

ei sicut faenerator; non ponetis super illum usuram. 25.  Si oppignerando oppigneraveris vestem socii tui, usque ad intrare solis restitues illam ei. 26.  Quia illa tegumentum ejus solum, illud vestis
