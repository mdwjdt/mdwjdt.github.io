<h3 align="center" class="ired">属天的奥秘 第7357节</h3>
<h4 align="center"></h4><p><strong>7357.</strong>“青蛙又要上你和你百姓并你众臣仆的身上”表由虚假所生的推理将在每一个部分中。这从前面所述（<a href="7355.htm">7355</a>节）清楚可知。“法老和他的百姓并众臣仆”表示在埃及地的每一个人，因而表示在每一个部分中的虚假。“法老和埃及人”表示虚假，这在前面已频繁说明。要知道，那些在地狱里，已经被剥夺他们在世上所知道的真理之人只能谈论虚假；因此，当他们出现在灵人界时，他们当中的任何一个人说话时，他所说的话立刻被人知道是虚假。在来世，正直人从平常的经历知道这一点。他们只谈论虚假，这一事实从主在约翰福音中的话也明显看出来：<br />你们是出于你们的父魔鬼，你们父的私欲，你们偏要行。他从起初是杀人的，不守真理，因真理不在他里面；他说谎，是出于他自己说的，因他本来是说谎的，也是谎言之父。（约翰福音<a href="http://39-27.cn/约8.44.htm">8:44</a>）<br />因为各人都各人的爱之情感说话，没有人能违背这情感说话，除非伪装、假冒为善、诡计、欺骗促使他如此行，如恶人在谈论真理时的情形。但他们如此谈论的真理仍是与他们同在的虚假。而另一方面，那些出于良善处于真理的人不能不谈论真理。</p>

And on thee, and of thy people and on all thy servants shall the frogs come up. That this signifies that reasonings from falsities shall be in all things both in general and in particular is evident 
from what was said above (n. 7355); all and each of those who were in the land of Egypt are signified by "Pharaoh, his people, and his servants," thus falsities in general and in particular. That by "Pharaoh 
and the Egyptians" are signified falsities has been often shown above. Be it known that they who are in hell, and who have been deprived of the truths which they had known in the world, cannot 
do otherwise than speak falsities; and therefore when any such infernal speaks, as when they appear in the world of spirits, it is at once known that what he speaks is false. This is known to the upright 
in the other life from common experience. That they speak nothing but what is false, is clear also from the words of the Lord in John: </p>
<p>     Ye are of your father the devil, and the desires of your 
father ye will to do. He was a murderer from the beginning, and stood not in the truth, because the truth is not in him. When he speaketh a lie, he speaketh from his own; because he is the speaker 
of a lie, and the father of it (John 8:44); </p>
<p>for everyone speaks according to the affection of his love, and no one can speak contrary to it, except from dissimulation, hypocrisy, fraud, and deceit, as 
is the case with the evil when they speak truths. But these truths which they so speak, are nevertheless falsities with them. But on the other hand, they who are in truth from good cannot but speak truths. </p>

<p align="center"><b>Elliott(1983-1999) 7357</b></p><p><b>7357.</b>
'And onto you, and onto your people, and onto all your servants the frogs will rise up' means that the reasonings arising from falsities will be in every single part. This is clear from what has been 
stated above in <a href="7355.htm">7355</a>. Every single person who is in the land of Egypt is meant by 'Pharaoh, his people, and his servants', thus falsities in every single part (it has often been shown above that falsities 
are meant by 'Pharaoh and the Egyptians'). It should be recognized that those in hell, from whom the truths which they knew in the world have been taken away, cannot do anything other than speak 
falsities. This accounts for what happens when they appear in the world of spirits - when anyone of their sort speaks, what he says is known instantly to be false. The upright in the next life know it 
from ordinary experience. The fact that such people speak nothing but falsity is also plain from the Lord's words in John,  </p>
<blockquote>
You are from your father the devil, and the desires of your father you 
will to do. He was a murderer from the beginning, and has not stood in the truth because the truth is not in him. When he speaks a lie he speaks from the things that are his own, for he is the teller 
of a lie and the father of it. <a href="http://bible.gospelcom.net/cgi-bin/bible?passage=John%208:44&amp;version=ESV&amp;interface=print&amp;showfn=yes&amp;showxref">John 8:44</a>. 
</blockquote>
<p>For everyone speaks in keeping with the impulses of his love; no one can speak contrary to them unless pretence, hypocrisy, fraudulence, or deceitfulness prompt 
him to do so, as is usually the case with the evil when they speak truths. But these truths which they speak are nevertheless falsities with them. On the other hand those who are guided by truth 
because they are motivated by good cannot do other than speak truths. </p>

`Et in te, et in populum tuum, et in omnes servos tuos, ascendent ranae': quod significet quod ratiocinia ex falsis erunt in omnibus et singulis, constat ex illis quae supra n. 7355 dicta sunt; {1}omnes 
et singuli qui in terra Aegypti significantur per `Pharaonem, populum ejus, et servos ejus,' ita falsa in omnibus et singulis; quod per `Pharaonem et Aegyptios' falsa significentur, saepius supra 
ostensum est.  Sciendum quod qui in inferno sunt, quibus vera quae {2}in mundo sciverunt adempta sunt, non possint aliter quam falsa loqui; inde est cum aliquis talis loquitur, quod fit cum apparent 
in mundo spirituum, quod ilico sciatur quod falsum sit; hoc probi in altera vita ex communi experientia norunt; quod non nisi quam falsum loquantur, liquet etiam a Domini verbis apud Johannem, Vos ex 
patre diabolo estis, et desideria patris vestri vultis facere; ille homicida erat ab initio, et in veritate non stetit, quia veritas non est in illo; quando loquitur mendacium, ex propriis loquitur, 
quia mendacium loquens est, et pater ejus, viii 44; </p>
<p>quisque enim secundum affectionem amoris sui loquitur, et contra illam nemo loqui potest nisi ex simulatione, hypocrisi, fraude, et dolo, ut solent 
mali cum vera loquuntur; sed haec vera quae ita loquuntur usque {3}apud illos sunt falsa; vicissim (d)autem qui in vero sunt ex bono, illi non possunt aliter quam vera loqui. 	@1 omnia enim et singula 
quae in Aegypto$ 	@2 After sciverunt$ 	@3 illis$ </p>
