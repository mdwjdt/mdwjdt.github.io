<h3 align="center" class="ired">属天的奥秘 第8513节</h3>
<h4 align="center"></h4><p><strong>8513.</strong>“你们不肯守我的诫命和律法要到几时呢”表因为他们不照神性秩序行事。这从刚才的解释（<a href="8512.htm">8512</a>节）清楚可知。为让人们知道什么叫照神性秩序行事，什么叫不照神性秩序行事，必须进一步予以说明。照神性秩序所行的一切从内在一路向主敞开，因而含有天堂在里面；但不照神性秩序所行的一切从内在关闭，因而没有天堂在里面。<br />因此，对主来说，神性秩序就是通过人的内层流入他的外层，因而通过人的意愿流入他的行为。当一个人处于良善时，也就是说，当为了良善而非自己行良善的一种情感主导他时，这一切就会实实在在地发生。当一个人为了自己而非良善行良善时，他的内层就关闭，主无法藉着天堂引导他；相反，他被自我引导。爱决定了他被谁引导，因为每个人都被自己的爱引导。爱自己胜过邻舍的人被自我引导；而爱良善的人被良善引导，因而被作为良善源头的主引导。<br />由此可见照秩序生活和不照秩序生活之间有何区别。圣言和取自圣言的教义教导了人当如何生活才能使得生活符合秩序。不越过外在事物去观看的人永远无法理解这些观念；因为他不知道何为内在，几乎不知道内在的存在，更不用说这内在能被打开，并且当它被打开时，天堂就在它里面。尤其世上的知识分子，对它一无所知，其中那些认同内在存在的人却对它没有任何概念，或只有一种愚蠢的概念。这解释了为何他们几乎没有真正的信仰，而且还利用他们的知识来确认这一观点：一切事物都是由于自然的力量。</p>

How long do ye refuse to keep My commandments and My laws? That this signifies on account of their not acting according to Divine order, is evident from what has just been unfolded (n. 8512). That it 
may be known what it is to act according to Divine order, and what not to act according to it, something further shall be said. Everything that is done according to Divine order is inwardly open even 
to the Lord, and thus has heaven in it; but everything that is not done according to Divine order is inwardly closed, and thus has not heaven in it.  [2] Therefore Divine order is for the Lord to flow 
in through the interiors of man into his exteriors, thus through the will of man into his action. This takes place when the man is in good, that is, when he is in the affection of doing good for the 
sake of good, and not for the sake of himself. When a man does good for the sake of himself, and not for the sake of good, his interiors are closed, and he cannot be led of the Lord by means of heaven, 
but he is led by himself. The love determines by whom he is led, for everyone is led by his love. He who loves himself more than his neighbor, leads himself; but he who loves good is led by good, 
consequently by the Lord from whom is good.  [3] From all this it can be seen what the difference is between living according to order, and not living according to it. How a man must live for it to be 
according to order, the Word teaches, and the doctrine of faith from the Word. He who does not look beyond external things cannot possibly apprehend this; for he knows not what that which is internal 
is, scarcely that there is anything internal, and still less that this internal can be opened, and that when it is opened, heaven is therein. The intelligent of the world are especially in this ignorance, 
and those of them who hold that there is something internal, nevertheless have no idea, or a fatuous idea, about it. Hence it is that they believe but little, and moreover apply their knowledges 
to confirm that all things are of nature. </p>

<p align="center"><b>Elliott(1983-1999) 8513</b></p><p><b>8513.</b>
'How long do you refuse to keep My commandments and My laws?' means because their actions were not in keeping with Divine order. This is clear from the explanation immediately above in <a href="8512.htm">8512</a>. So that 
people may know what an action in keeping with Divine order is and what one not in keeping with it is, something further must be said. Everything done in keeping with Divine order is inwardly open all 
the way to the Lord, and so holds heaven within it; but everything not done in keeping with Divine order is inwardly closed, and so does not hold heaven within it. </p>
<p></p>
<p><b>[2]</b>
 Divine order therefore is for 
the Lord to flow through the inner levels of a person into the outer ones, thus through the person's will into his actions. This actually happens when a person is governed by good, that is, when an 
affection to do good for its own sake and not for any selfish reason governs him. When anyone does good for a selfish reason and not for its own sake his inner levels are closed, and he cannot be led 
by the Lord by means of heaven, only by self. The love determines whom he is led by, for everyone is led by his love. One who loves himself more than his neighbour is led by self; but one who loves good 
is led by good and consequently by the Lord, who is the Source of good. </p>
<p></p>
<p><b>[3]</b>
 From all this one may see what the difference is between living a life in keeping with order and not living a life in 
keeping with it. How to live so that one's life is in keeping with order is taught by the Word and by religious teachings drawn from the Word. The person who does not look beyond externals can never grasp 
such ideas. He does not know what the internal is; he scarcely knows of the existence of the internal, let alone that it can be opened up, and that when it has been opened it has heaven within it. 
The intelligentsia of the world especially are ignorant of it, and those of them who do subscribe to the existence of an internal nevertheless have no idea of what it is or only a foolish one. This 
explains why they have little real belief and also why they use their knowledge to confirm the notion that all things are due to natural forces. </p>

`Quousque renuitis custodire praecepta Mea, et leges Meas?' quod significet quod non {1}secundum ordinem Divinum agerent, constat ex illis quae nunc supra n. 8512 explicata sunt.  Ut sciatur quid sit 
secundum ordinem Divinum agere, et non secundum {2}illum agere, adhuc dicetur: omne quod fit secundum ordinem Divinum, hoc intus apertum est usque ad Dominum, et sic in se habet caelum, at omne quod 
non fit secundum ordinem Divinum, hoc intus est 2 clausum, et sic non in se habet caelum; ordo {3}itaque Divinus est ut Dominus influat per {4}interiora hominis {5}in exteriora ejus, ita per voluntatem 
hominis in ejus agere; hoc fit cum homo in bono est, hoc est, cum in affectione faciendi bonum propter bonum et non propter se; cum homo propter se id facit et non propter bonum, tunc clausa sunt interiora, 
et non duci potest per caelum a Domino, sed ducitur a se; amor determinat a quo ducitur, nam {6}amor suus unumquemvis ducit; qui amat se prae proximo, is se (x)ducit, qui autem amat bonum, bonum 
eum ducit, consequenter Dominus a Quo bonum; ex his videri potest quae differentia est vivere secundum ordinem, et 3 non vivere secundum {7}illum; quomodo vivendum ut sit secundum ordinem, docet 
Verbum, et doctrinale fidei ex Verbo; qui non ultra spectat quam ad externa, talia nusquam potest capere, ille non scit {8}quid internum, vix quod internum sit, et minus quod internum possit aperiri, 
et quod cum apertum est, in illo (t)sit caelum; intelligentes mundi imprimis in hac inscitia sunt, et qui illorum statuunt internum, de illo usque vel nullam vel fatuam habent ideam; inde est quod illi 
{9}parum credant, et {10}quoque quod scientias suas applicent ad confirmandum quod omnia naturae sint. 	@1 d propter ordinem i secundum ordinem  cp n 8511$ 	@2 illa$ 	@3 enim$ 	@4 intima$ 	@5 ad$ 	@6
