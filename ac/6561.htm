<h3 align="center" class="ired">属天的奥秘 第6561节</h3>
<h4 align="center"></h4><p><strong>6561.</strong>“你父亲未死以先吩咐说”表这是按着教会的诫命。这从以色列的代表，以及“吩咐”和“未死以先”的含义清楚可知：以色列，即此处的“父亲”，是指教会（参看<a href="4286.htm">4286</a>，<a href="6426.htm">6426</a>节）；“吩咐”是指流注（<a href="6560.htm">6560</a>节），在此是指诫命，因为它出自教会，因而出自神性；“未死以先”是指当教会仍旧存在之时。按着教会的诫命，人当宽恕自己的弟兄或邻舍，这一点从主在马太福音中的话明显看出来：<br />彼得对耶稣说，主阿，我弟兄常得罪我，我当饶恕他几次呢？到七次？耶稣对他说，我对你说，不是到七次，乃是到七十个七次。（马太福音<a href="http://39-27.cn/太18.21.htm">18:21</a>，<a href="http://39-27.cn/太18.22.htm">22</a>）<br />不过，犹太民族有这样一个根深蒂固的观念：他们永远不可原谅以任何方式伤害他们的任何人，而是把他视为仇敌。他们认为，他们可以仇恨他，随心所欲地对待他，并杀害他。他们之所以有这样的想法，是因为这个民族唯独处于没有内在之物的外在之物；因此，他们不受内在教会的任何诫命的约束。这就是约瑟的哥哥们如此害怕约瑟怀恨他们，害怕以恶报复他们的原因。</p>

Thy father did command before he died, saying. That this signifies that it is by command of the church, is evident from the representation of Israel, here the "father," as being the church (see n. 4286, 
6426); from the signification of "commanding," as being influx (n. 6560), and in this case command, because it comes from the church, thus from the Divine; and from the signification of "before he 
died," as being while the church still existed. That it is by command of the church that everyone ought to forgive his brother or neighbor, is evident from the Lord's words in Matthew: </p>
<p>     Peter said 
unto Jesus, Lord, how often shall my brother sin against me, and I forgive him? until seven times? Jesus saith to him, I say not until seven times, but until seventy times seven (Matt. 18:21, 22). But 
it was ingrained in the Jewish nation that they should never forgive, but should hold as an enemy everyone who had in any way injured them, and they then thought it allowable to hate him, and to 
treat him as they chose, even to kill him. The reason was that this nation was in externals alone without what is internal, thus was in no command of the internal church. This was the reason why the brethren 
of Joseph were so much afraid that Joseph would hate them, and would requite evil to them. </p>

<p align="center"><b>Elliott(1983-1999) 6561</b></p><p><b>6561.</b>
'Your father commanded before he died, saying' means that it is by the command of the Church. This is clear from the representation of Israel, to whom 'father' refers here, as the Church, dealt with 
in <a href="4286.htm">4286</a>, <a href="6426.htm">6426</a>; from the meaning of 'commanding' as influx, dealt with immediately above in <a href="6560.htm">6560</a>, here a command which, being that of the Church, accordingly comes from the Divine; and from the meaning 
of 'before he died' as when the Church was still in existence. The fact that it is by the command of the Church that one should forgive one's brother or the neighbour is clear from the Lord's words in 
Matthew, </p>
<blockquote>
Peter said to Jesus, Lord, how many times shall my brother sin against me and I ought to forgive him? Up to seven times? Jesus said to him, I do not say this, up to seven times, but up to 
seventy times seven. <a href="http://bible.gospelcom.net/cgi-bin/bible?passage=Matt%2018:21,%2022&amp;version=ESV&amp;interface=print&amp;showfn=yes&amp;showxref">Matt 18:21, 22</a>. 
</blockquote>
<p>But the idea was ingrained in the Jewish nation that they should never forgive anyone at all who had harmed them in any way but retain him as their enemy. They 
thought they were allowed to hate him, treat him in whatever way they liked, and kill him. The reason they thought this was that external things alone and nothing internal concerned that nation; thus 
they were not subject to any command of the internal Church. This was why Joseph's brothers were so afraid that Joseph would hate them and repay them with evil. </p>

`Pater (x)tuus praecepit ante mori eum, dicendo': quod significet quod ab Ecclesiae praecepto, constat ex repraesentatione `Israelis' qui hic `pater', quod sit Ecclesia, de qua n. 4286, 6426; et ex 
significatione `praecipere' quod sit influxus, de qua mox supra n. 6560, hic praeceptum quia Ecclesiae, ita a Divino; et ex significatione `ante mori eum' quod sit cum adhuc Ecclesia esset. (m)Quod sit 
ab Ecclesiae pracepto quod remittendum fratri {1}suo seu proximo, constat a Domini verbis apud Matthaeum, Petrus dixit ad Jesum, Domine, quoties peccabit in me frater meus, et remittere debeo illi? 
usque ad septies? dixit illi Jesus, Non dico hoc usque ad septies, sed usque ad septuagies septies, xviii 21, 22; </p>
<p>sed apud gentem Judaicam (t)insitum erat quod {2}nusquam remitterent, sed pro hoste 
haberent {3}quemcumque qui illos aliquo modo laeserat, et tunc putabant sibi licere {4}odio illum habere, et tractare ad libitum, atque occidere; causa erat quia {5}gens illa erat in solis externis absque
