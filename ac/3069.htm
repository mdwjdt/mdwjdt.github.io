<h3 align="center" class="ired">属天的奥秘 第3069节</h3>
<h4 align="center"></h4><p><strong>3069.</strong>“给我水喝”表由此而来的真理上的教导。这从“喝”的含义清楚可知，“喝”是指接受教导。“喝”在圣言各处都有所提及；凡论述信之良善与真理的地方，“喝”都表示在良善与真理上得到教导，并接受它们。如以赛亚书：<br />新酒悲哀，葡萄树衰残；心中快乐的俱都叹息；人必不得饮酒唱歌；喝浓酒的，必以为苦。（以赛亚书<a href="http://39-27.cn/赛24.7.htm">24:7</a>，<a href="http://39-27.cn/赛24.9.htm">9</a>）<br />“不得饮酒唱歌”表不是通过对真理的情感接受教导，没有由此感到快乐。“喝浓酒的，必以为苦”表厌恶。同一先知书：<br />又像口渴的人在作梦，看哪，他在喝水；但醒了后，看哪，他仍觉发昏，心里想喝。（以赛亚书<a href="http://39-27.cn/赛29.8.htm">29:8</a>）<br />“口渴的人”表渴望接受教导的人；“喝”表接受教导，不过是在毫无价值的事上。<br />耶利米哀歌：<br />我们出银钱才得水喝；我们的柴是付代价而得。（耶利米哀歌<a href="http://39-27.cn/哀5.4.htm">5:4</a>）<br />“出银钱才得水喝”表接受教导不是无条件的，以及将真理归于人的自我。真理是免费的恩赐，因而并非来自人的自我，而是来自主，如以赛亚书中这些话所教导的：<br />你们一切干渴的都当就近水来，没有银钱的，你们也来买。（以赛亚书<a href="http://39-27.cn/赛55.1.htm">55:1</a>）<br />约翰福音：<br />耶稣说，人若渴了，可以到我这里来喝！信我的人，从他腹中要流出活水的江河来。（约翰福音<a href="http://39-27.cn/约7.37.htm">7:37</a>-<a href="http://39-27.cn/约7.38.htm">38</a>）<br />此处“喝”表示被教导并接受。路加福音：<br />他们要说，我们在你面前吃过、喝过，你也在我们的街上教训过人。但主说，我不晓得你们是哪里来的；你们这一切作恶的人，离开我去吧！（路加福音<a href="http://39-27.cn/路13.26.htm">13:26</a>-<a href="http://39-27.cn/路13.27.htm">27</a>）<br />此处“在主面前吃过、喝过”表教导并传讲信之良善与真理，并且是通过取自圣言的认知这样做的，这就是“你在我们的街上教训过人”这句话的意思。但由于他们这样做是出于自私的理由，即为了个人的名利，不是出于对良善与真理的任何情感，因而虽拥有对真理的认知，却过着邪恶的生活，故经上说：“我不晓得你们是哪里来的；你们这一切作恶的人，离开我去吧！”<br />在同一福音书，耶稣在与门徒交谈时，说：<br />你们在我国里，坐在我的席上吃喝。（路加福音<a href="http://39-27.cn/路22.30.htm">22:30</a>）<br />谁都明显看出，他们不是真的在主的国里吃喝，那里也没有什么筵席。因此，“在主国里坐在祂的席上吃喝”表示其它事，也就是说，表示享有对良善与真理的直觉。主在马太福音中所说的话也是如此：<br />我告诉你们，从今以后我不再喝这葡萄汁，直到我在我父的国里同你们喝新的那日子。（马太福音<a href="http://39-27.cn/太26.29.htm">26:29</a>）<br />“喝”表在真理上给予活生生的教导，并赋予对良善与真理的直觉。主说：<br />不要为生命忧虑吃什么，喝什么；为身体忧虑穿什么。（马太福音<a href="http://39-27.cn/太6.25.htm">6:25</a>，<a href="http://39-27.cn/太6.31.htm">31</a>；路加福音<a href="http://39-27.cn/路12.29.htm">12:29</a>）<br />这些话反映了属灵之物，也就是说，就良善与真理而言，信的一切事物都由主赋予。约翰福音：<br />耶稣对撒马利亚的妇人说，凡喝这水的，还要再渴；人若喝我所赐他的水，就永远不渴；我所赐他的水要在他里头成为水泉，直涌到永生。（约翰福音<a href="http://39-27.cn/约4.7.htm">4:7</a>-<a href="http://39-27.cn/约4.14.htm">14</a>）<br />“喝”明显表示在良善与真理上得到教导，并接受它们。</p>

<p align="center"><b>Potts(1905-1910) 3069</b></p><p><b>3069.</b>
That I may drink. That this signifies instruction in truth therefrom, is evident from the signification of "drinking," as being to be instructed. In the Word throughout mention is made of "drinking;" 
and where the good and truth of faith are treated of, there "drinking" signifies being instructed in them and receiving them. As in Isaiah: </p>
<p>     The new wine shall mourn, the vine languisheth, all the 
glad of heart shall sigh; they shall not drink wine with a song, strong drink shall be bitter to them that drink it (Isa. 24:7, 9); </p>
<p>"not drinking wine with a song," denotes not being instructed from 
the affection of truth and not being delighted thereby; that "strong drink shall be bitter to them that drink it," denotes aversion. In the same: </p>
<p>     It shall be as when a thirsty one dreameth, and 
behold he drinketh; but he awaketh, and behold he is weary, and his soul hath appetite (Isa. 29:8); </p>
<p>a "thirsty one" denotes one who desires to be instructed; "drinking," being instructed, but in things 
that are vain. [2] In Jeremiah: </p>
<p>     We have drunk our water for silver; our wood cometh for a price (Lam. 5:4); </p>
<p>"drinking waters for silver" denotes being instructed not without cost, and also 
attributing truth to one's self. That it is given free of cost, and thus that it is not from one's self, but from the Lord, is thus taught in Isaiah: </p>
<p>     Ho everyone that thirsteth, come ye to the 
waters, and he that hath no silver; come ye, buy (Isa. 55:1). Also in John: </p>
<p>     Jesus said, If anyone thirst, let him come unto Me and drink; whosoever believeth in Me, out of his belly shall flow 
rivers of living water (John 7:37-38); </p>
<p>where by "drinking" is signified being instructed, and receiving. In Luke: </p>
<p>     They shall say, We did eat and drink in Thy presence, and Thou didst teach in 
our streets; but the Lord says, I know you not whence ye are; depart from Me, all ye workers of iniquity (Luke 13:26-27); </p>
<p>where "eating and drinking in the Lord's presence," denotes instructing and 
preaching the good and truth of faith from knowledges that are from the Word, which is meant by the words, "Thou didst teach in our streets." But as they did this from themselves, for the sake of their 
own honor and gain, and thus from no affection of good and truth, and were thus in knowledges of truth but in a life of evil, it is said, "I know you not whence ye are; depart from Me all ye workers 
of iniquity." [3] In the same: </p>
<p>     Jesus, speaking to the disciples, said, That ye may eat and drink at My table in My kingdom (Luke 22:30). That they do not eat and drink in the kingdom of the Lord, 
and that there is no table there, is plain to everyone; so that by "eating and drinking at the Lord's table in His kingdom," something else is signified, namely, enjoying the perception of good and 
truth. So too with what the Lord says in Matthew: </p>
<p>     I say unto you, that I will not drink henceforth of this product of the vine, until that day when I shall drink it with you in My Father's kingdom 
(Matt. 26:29); </p>
<p>where "drinking" signifies instructing to the life concerning truths, and giving perception of good and truth. These words of the Lord: </p>
<p>     Be not anxious for your life [anima], 
what ye shall eat, or what ye shall drink, nor yet for your body, what ye shall put on (Matt. 6:25, 31; Luke 12:29); </p>
<p>are significative of spiritual things, namely, that the all of faith as to good 
and truth is given by the Lord. In John: </p>
<p>     Jesus said to the woman of Samaria, Everyone that drinketh of this water shall thirst again; but whosoever drinketh of the water that I shall give him shall 
never thirst; but the water that I shall give him shall become in him a fountain of water springing up unto eternal life (John 4:7-14); </p>
<p>where "drinking" manifestly denotes being instructed in good 
and truth, and receiving them. </p>

<p align="center"><b>Elliott(1983-1999) 3069</b></p><p><b>3069.</b>
'And I will drink' means instruction from them in truth. This is clear from the meaning of 'drinking' as receiving instruction. References to 'drinking' occur in various places in the Word, and whenever 
the subject is the goods and truths of faith, instruction in these and reception of them is meant, as in Isaiah, </p>
<blockquote>
The new wine will mourn, the vine will languish, all the merry-hearted will sigh; 
they will not drink wine with singing, strong drink will be bitter to those drinking it. <a href="http://bible.gospelcom.net/cgi-bin/bible?passage=Isa%2024:7,%209&amp;version=ESV&amp;interface=print&amp;showfn=yes&amp;showxref">Isa 24:7, 9</a>. 
</blockquote>
<p>'Not drinking wine with singing' stands for not receiving instruction from the affection for 
truth and not receiving any consequent delight. 'Strong drink being bitter to those drinking it' stands for repugnance. In the same prophet, </p>
<blockquote>
It will be as when a thirsting man dreams, and behold, 
he is drinking; and he awakes, and behold, he is faint, and the soul is craving. <a href="http://bible.gospelcom.net/cgi-bin/bible?passage=Isa%2029:8&amp;version=ESV&amp;interface=print&amp;showfn=yes&amp;showxref">Isa 29:8</a>. 
</blockquote>
<p>'Thirsting' stands for desiring instruction, 'drinking' for receiving it, but in things that are valueless. </p>
<p></p>
<p><b>[2]</b>
In Jeremiah, </p>
<blockquote>
Our waters we drink for silver, our timbers come for a price. <a href="http://bible.gospelcom.net/cgi-bin/bible?passage=Lam%205:4&amp;version=ESV&amp;interface=print&amp;showfn=yes&amp;showxref">Lam 5:4</a>. 
</blockquote>
<p>'Drinking waters for silver' stands for receiving instruction but not for nothing, and also attributing 
truth to oneself. Truth is a free gift and so does not come from oneself but from the Lord, as these words in Isaiah declare, </p>
<blockquote>
Everyone who thirsts, come to the waters, and he who has no money, 
come, buy! <a href="http://bible.gospelcom.net/cgi-bin/bible?passage=Isa%2055:1&amp;version=ESV&amp;interface=print&amp;showfn=yes&amp;showxref">Isa 55:1</a>. 
</blockquote>
<p>And in John, </p>
<blockquote>
Jesus said, If anyone thirsts let him come to Me and drink. Whoever believes in Me, out of his belly will flow rivers of living water. <a href="http://bible.gospelcom.net/cgi-bin/bible?passage=John%207:37,%2038&amp;version=ESV&amp;interface=print&amp;showfn=yes&amp;showxref">John 7:37, 38</a>. 
</blockquote>
<p>Here 
'drinking' means being given instruction and accepting it. In Luke, </p>
<blockquote>
They will say, We ate in Your presence and we drank, and You taught in our streets. But the Lord will say, I do not know where you 
come from; depart from Me, all you workers of iniquity! <a href="http://bible.gospelcom.net/cgi-bin/bible?passage=Luke%2013:26,%2027&amp;version=ESV&amp;interface=print&amp;showfn=yes&amp;showxref">Luke 13:26, 27</a>. 
</blockquote>
<p>Here 'eating and drinking in the Lord's presence' stands for giving instruction in, and proclaiming, the good and truth of 
faith, doing so from cognitions drawn from the Word, which is meant by 'You taught in our streets'. But because they did it for selfish reasons - for the sake of personal honour and gain, thus not out 
of any affection for good and truth, and so possessed cognitions of truth and yet led evil lives - it is said, 'I do not know where you come from; depart from Me, all you workers of iniquity!' </p>
<p></p>
<p><b>[3]</b>
In the same gospel, where Jesus was talking to the disciples, </p>
<blockquote>
That you may eat and drink at My table in My kingdom. <a href="http://bible.gospelcom.net/cgi-bin/bible?passage=Luke%2022:30&amp;version=ESV&amp;interface=print&amp;showfn=yes&amp;showxref">Luke 22:30</a>. 
</blockquote>
<p>It is evident to anyone that in the Lord's kingdom they do not eat 
and drink, and that no table is there, thus that something different is meant by 'eating and drinking at the Lord's table in His kingdom', that is to say, enjoying a perception of good and truth. So 
also with what the Lord says in Matthew, </p>
<blockquote>
I tell you that I shall not drink from now on of this fruit of the vine until that day when I drink it [new] with you in My Father's kingdom. <a href="http://bible.gospelcom.net/cgi-bin/bible?passage=Matt%2026:28,%2029&amp;version=ESV&amp;interface=print&amp;showfn=yes&amp;showxref">Matt 26:28, 29</a>. 
</blockquote>
<p>'Drinking' stands for giving living instruction in truths and imparting a perception of good and truth. That which the Lord said - </p>
<blockquote>
 Do not be anxious for your soul, what you are going to eat 
or what you are going to drink, nor for your body, what you are going to put on. <a href="http://bible.gospelcom.net/cgi-bin/bible?passage=Matt%206:25,%2031&amp;version=ESV&amp;interface=print&amp;showfn=yes&amp;showxref">Matt 6:25, 31</a>; <a href="http://bible.gospelcom.net/cgi-bin/bible?passage=Luke%2012:29%20-&amp;version=ESV&amp;interface=print&amp;showfn=yes&amp;showxref">Luke 12:29 -</a> 
</blockquote>
is indicative of spiritual things, that so far as all things of faith are concerned, goodness 
and truth are imparted by the Lord. In John, </p>
<blockquote>
Jesus said to the Samaritan woman, Everyone who drinks of this water will thirst again, but he who drinks from the water that I shall give him will 
never thirst. But the water that I shall give him will become in him a spring of water leaping up into eternal life. <a href="http://bible.gospelcom.net/cgi-bin/bible?passage=John%204:7-14&amp;version=ESV&amp;interface=print&amp;showfn=yes&amp;showxref">John 4:7-14</a>. 
</blockquote>
'Drinking' clearly stands for being given instruction in goods and truths, 
and the acceptance of them. </p>

</p><b>3069.</b>
`Et bibam': quod significet instructionem veri inde, constat ea significatione `bibere' quod sit instrui: in Verbo passim legitur `bibere,' et ubi de bonis et veris fidei agitur, ibi significat instrui 
in illis, et recipere illa; ut apud Esaiam,           Lugebit mustum, languescit vitis, gement omnes      laetantes corde,...in cantu non bibent vinum, amara erit      sicera bibentibus illam, 
xxiv 7, 9; </p>
<p>`in cantu non bibere vinum' pro non ex affectione veri instrui, et delectari unde; `amara sicera bibentibus illam' pro aversatione: apud eundem,           Erit...sicut somniat sitiens, et 
ecce bibens, et      expergiscitur, et ecce lassus, et anima appetens, xxix 8; </p>
<p>`sitiens' pro cupiens instrui, `bibens' pro instrui, sed in vanis: [2] apud Jeremiam,           Aquas nostras pro argento 
bibimus, ligna nostra pro       pretio veniunt, Thren. v 4; </p>
<p>`aquas bibere pro argento' pro non gratis instrui, tum sibi tribuere verum; quod gratis detur, {1}sic quod non a se, sed a Domino, ita 
apud Esaiam,           Omnis sitiens ite ad aquas, et cui non argentum, ite,       emite, lv I: </p>
<p>et apud Johannem,           Jesus dixit, Si quis sitiverit, venito ad Me, et      bibito; quisquis 
credit in Me, flumina e ventre ejus fluent      aquae viventis, vii 37, 38; </p>
<p>ubi per `bibere' significatur instrui, et recipere: apud Lucam,           Dicent, Edimus coram Te, et bibimus, et in plateis 
      nostris docuisti; sed (x)dicet Dominus, Non novi vos unde      sitis, discedite a Me omnes operarii iniquitatis, xiii 26, 27; </p>
<p>ubi `edere et bibere coram Domino' pro instruere et praedicare 
bonum et verum fidei, ex cognitionibus quae e Verbo, quod significatur per `in plateis nostris docuisti'; at quia ex se, sui honoris et lucri causa, ita ex nulla affectione boni et veri, ita quod 
in cognitionibus veri, sed in vita mali, dicitur `non novi vos unde sitis, discedite omnes operarii iniquitatis': [3] apud eundem,           Jesus ad discipulos;...ut comedatis et bibatis super     
  mensa Mea in regno Meo, xxii 30; </p>
<p>quod in regno Domini non comedant et bibant, nec ibi mensa, cuique patet, ita quod aliud per `edere et bibere super mensa Domini in regno Ipsius' significetur, nempe 
frui perceptione boni et veri: ita quoque, quae Dominus dicit apud Matthaeum,           Dico vobis, quod non bibiturus sim a nunc ex hoc      genimine vitis, usque ad diem illum, quando id bibero 
vobiscum      {2}in regno Patris Mei, xxvi 28, 29; </p>
<p>`bibere' pro ad vivum' instruere de veris, et dare perceptionem boni et veri.  Quod Dominus dixit,           Ne solliciti sitis animae vestrae, quid 
esuri sitis,       aut bibituri, nec corpori vestro quid induituri, Matth. vi 25,      31; Luc. xii 29, est significativum spiritualium, quod omne fidei quoad bonum et verum detur a Domino: apud 
Johannem,           Jesus ad mulierem Samaritidem; Omnis qui bibit ex aqua      hac, sitiet iterum; qui vero biberit ex aqua, quam Ego dabo      ei, non sitiet in aeternum, sed aqua, quam dabo ei, 
fiet in eo      fons aquae salientis in vitam aeternam, iv 7-14; </p>
