Verses 25-28. And Joseph commanded, and they filled their vessels with corn, and to restore their silver, everyone's into his sack, and to give them provision for the way; and he did thus to them. And 
they lifted their produce upon their asses, and went thence. And one opened his sack to give his ass provender in the inn, and he saw his silver; and behold it was in the mouth of his bag. And he said 
unto his brethren, My silver is restored, and lo it is even in my bag; and their heart went forth, and they trembled a man to his brother, saying, What is this that God hath done to us? "And Joseph 
commanded," signifies influx from the celestial of the spiritual; "and they filled their vessels with corn," signifies that the memory-knowledges were endowed with good from truth; "and to restore their 
silver," signifies without any ability of theirs; "everyone's into his sack," signifies wherever there was a receptacle in the natural; "and to give them provision for the way," signifies and that 
it would support the truths they had; "and he did thus to them," signifies the effect; "and they lifted their produce upon their asses," signifies that truths were gathered into memory-knowledges; "and 
they went thence," signifies the consequent life; "and one opened his sack," signifies observation; "to give his ass provender in the inn," signifies when there was reflection upon the memory-knowledges 
in the exterior natural; "he saw his silver," signifies perception that it was without any ability of their own; "and behold it was in the mouth of his bag," signifies that they were bestowed and 
stored up in the threshold of the exterior natural; "and he said unto his brethren," signifies general perception; "my silver is restored," signifies that there was no aid from them; "and lo it is even 
in my bag," signifies that it was in the exterior natural; "and their heart went forth," signifies fear; "and they trembled a man to his brother," signifies general terror; "saying, What is this that 
God hath done to us?" signifies on account of so much providence. </p>

Verses 25-28 And Joseph gave the command to fill<A name="fntext1"></a><A href="#fn1"><sup>a</sup></a> their vessels with grain, and to restore their silver, each man's in his sack, and to give them provision for the way; and thus he did for them. And 
they loaded their corn onto their asses, and went from there. And one opened his sack to give fodder to his ass, in a lodging-place, and he saw his silver, and behold, it was in the mouth of his pouch. 
And he said to his brothers, My silver has been restored, and also behold, it is in my pouch. And their heart went out of them, and they trembled [turning] a man to his brother, saying, What is this 
that God has done to us? </p>
<p>'And Joseph gave the command' means an influx from the celestial of the spiritual. 'To fill their vessels with grain' means that factual knowledge was endowed with good produced 
from truth. 'And to restore their silver' means without the expending of any power of their own. 'Each man's in his own sack' means wherever a receptacle exists in the natural. 'And to give them 
provision for the way' means and that support should be supplied to the truths they had. 'And thus he did [for them]' means a putting into effect. 'And they loaded their corn onto their asses' means 
the truths gathered into factual knowledge. 'And went from there' means subsequent life. 'And one opened his sack' means a perusal. 'To give fodder to his ass, in a lodging-place' means when they stopped 
to reflect on the facts present in the exterior natural. 'And he saw his silver' means a discernment that no power of their own had been expended. 'And it was in the mouth of his pouch' means that 
this was returned as a gift and was put back in the opening of the exterior natural. 'And he said to his brothers' means a perception shared by all. 'My silver has been restored' means that nothing 
of their own resources was taken from them. 'And also behold, it is in my pouch' means its presence in the exterior natural. 'And their heart went out of them' means fear. 'And they trembled [turning] 
a man to his brother' means the dread shared by them all. 'Saying, What is this that God has done to us?' means owing to so great an act of providence.

Vers. 25-28.  Et praecepit Joseph, et impleverunt vasa illorum frumento, et ad reducendum argentum illorum, cujuslibet in saccum illius, (x)et ad dandum illis viaticum ad viam; et fecit illis ita. Et 
sustulerunt annonam suam super asinos suos, et iverunt inde. Et aperuit unus saccum suum, ad dandum pabulum asino suo, in diversorio, et vidit argentum suum, et ecce illud in ore manticae illius. Et 
dixit ad fratres suos, Reductum argentum meum, et etiam ecce in mantica mea, et exivit cor illorum, et intremuerunt vir ad fratrem suum, dicendo, Quid hoc fecit Deus nobis? `Et praecepit Joseph' significat 
influxum a caelesti spiritualis: `et impleverunt vasa illorum frumento' significat scientifica quod bono a vero sint donata: `et ad reducendum argentum illorum' significat absque illorum ulla potentia: 
`cujuslibet in saccum {1}suum' significat ubicumque receptaculum in naturali: `et ad dandum illis viaticum {2}in viam' significat et quod sustentaret vera quae illis: `et fecit {3} ita' significat 
effectum: `et sustulerunt annonam (x)suam super asinos suos' significat vera collata in scientifica: `et iverunt inde' significat inde vitam:  `et aperuit unus saccum suum' significat observationem: 
`ad dandum pabulum asino suo, in diversorio' significat cum reflecteret super scientifica in naturali exteriore: `et vidit argentum suum' significat apperceptionem quod absque ulla potentia propria: 
`et {4}illud' in ore manticae {5}suae' significat quod donata, et reposita in limine naturalis exterioris: `et dixit ad fratres suos' significat perceptionem communem: `Reductum argentum meum' significat 
quod nihil opis ab illis: `et etiam ecce in mantica mea' significat quod in naturali exteriore: `et exivit cor illorum' significat timorem: `et intremuerunt vir ad fratrem {6}' significat terrorem 
communem: `dicendo, Quid hoc fecit Deus nobis?' significat ob tantum providentiae.  @1 Thus A I here and 5489.$ @2 Thus A I here and 5490; cp above$ @3 A I 0 illis here and 5491; cp above$ @4
