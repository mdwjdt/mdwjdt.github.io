<h3 align="center" class="ired">属天的奥秘 第3889节</h3>
<h4 align="center"></h4><p><strong>3889.</strong>为叫我不仅能了解属天之物，也就是爱的事物与心脏运动，并属灵之物，也就是源于爱的信之事物与肺脏运动存在一种对应关系，还能了解这种对应关系的性质，我被允许花大量时间与天使在一起，他们向我活生生地展示了这一切。他们通过一种奇妙的、无法描述的流入漩涡运动形成了一个心脏的形像和一个肺脏的形像，包括心肺里面所有错综复杂的内部和外部结构。然后，他们又追踪了天堂的自发流动，因为天堂竭力通过来自主的爱之流注展示这样一种形式。他们以这种方式展示了心脏的每一个部位，之后又展示了心与肺的联合，还以良善与真理的婚姻来代表这种联合。由此明显可知，心对应于良善的属天元素，而肺对应于真理的属灵元素；这二者若以物质形态联结起来，就是心脏与肺脏。我还被告知，这同样适用于全身，也就是身体的所有肢体、器官和脏腑。因为哪里这二者不一起行动，而是各自单独行动，哪里就没有以任何方式属于意愿的生命行动，也没有以任何方式始于认知的生命感觉。</p>

In order that I might know not only that there is a correspondence of the celestial things which are of love with the motions of the heart, and of the spiritual things which are of faith from love with 
the motions of the lungs, but also how the case is with this correspondence, it was given me for a considerable space of time to be among the angels, who showed it me to the life. By a wonderful and 
indescribable flowing into gyres they formed a semblance of a heart and another semblance of lungs, together with all the interior and exterior contextures that are in them. They then followed the flow 
of heaven in a free way; for heaven is in the endeavor toward such a form, from the influx of love from the Lord. Thus they presented the several parts that are in the heart; and afterwards the union 
between the heart and the lungs, which they also represented by the marriage of good and truth. From this it was evident that the heart corresponds to the celestial which is of good, and the lungs 
to the spiritual which is of truth; and that the conjunction of these two in a material form is precisely as is that of the heart and the lungs. I was also told that the case is similar in the body throughout 
(that is, in its several members, organs, and viscera) in regard to the things therein which are of the heart, and those which are of the lungs; for where both do not act, and each distinctly 
take its turn, there cannot be any motion of life from any principle of the will, nor any feeling of life from any principle of the understanding. </p>

To enable me to know not only that there is a correspondence of celestial things, which are those of love, with the motions of the heart, and of spiritual things, which are those of faith derived from 
love, with the motions of the lungs, but also the nature of this correspondence, I was allowed to spend a significant amount of time with angels who were to demonstrate this to me visually. By means 
of wonderful circular movements, impossible to describe, they formed a resemblance of the heart and a resemblance of the lungs, including all the intricate interior and exterior parts which the heart 
and lungs possess. They traced the spontaneous flow of heaven, for heaven strives to exhibit that form from the influx into itself of love from the Lord. In this manner each individual part of the heart 
was exhibited, and after that the union of the heart and the lungs, which union they also represented by means of the marriage of good and truth. From this also it was evident that the heart corresponds 
to the celestial element of good and the lungs to the spiritual element of truth, and that the material form in which the two exist joined together is the heart and lungs. I was also told that 
the same applies throughout the whole body, that is, to things of the heart and those of the lungs within all the individual members, organs, and viscera of the body. For where the two are not acting 
together but each one by turns separately, no motion of life belonging in any way in the will can exist there nor any feeling of life beginning in any way in the understanding there. </p>

Ut scirem non modo quod correspondentia sit caelestium quae sunt amoris cum motibus cordis, et spiritualium {1} quae sunt fidei ex amore cum motibus pulmonum, sed etiam quomodo se haberet, dabatur 
per insigne temporis spatium interesse angelis, qui hoc ad vivum ostenderent; formabant illi per mirabilem et nullis vocibus expressibilem fluxionem in gyros, instar cordis et instar pulmonum, cum 
omnibus contexturis {2} interioribus et exterioribus quae in illis; et tunc sequebantur fluxum caeli spontaneo modo, nam caelum connititur in talem formam ex influxu amoris a Domino; ita sistebant 
singula quae in corde, et dein unionem inter cor et pulmones, quam etiam repraesentabant per conjugium boni et veri; ex eo etiam patuit quod cor correspondeat caelesti quod est boni, et pulmones 
spirituali quod est veri; et quod utriusque conjunctio in forma materiali se habeat sicut cordis et pulmonum: et dictum quod similiter se habeat in universo corpore, nempe in singulis ejus membris, 
organis et visceribus, cum illis quae ibi sunt cordis, et quae ibi sunt pulmonum; ubi enim non ambo agunt {3}, et unumquodvis {4} distincte suas vices, ibi non potest esse aliquis motus vitae a principio 
aliquo voluntario, nec aliquis sensus vitae a principio aliquo intellectuali. @1 i correspondentia$ @2 illis$ @3 i illa$ @4 unumquodlibet$ </p>
