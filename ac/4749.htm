<h3 align="center" class="ired">属天的奥秘 第4749节</h3>
<h4 align="center"></h4><p><strong>4749.</strong>“要带下埃及去”表基于记忆知识的教导。这从“埃及”的含义清楚可知，“埃及”是指记忆知识（<a href="1164.htm">1164</a>，<a href="1165.htm">1165</a>，<a href="1462.htm">1462</a>节）；由于“香料、乳香、没药”表示那些处于诸如外邦人所处的简单良善之人所拥有记忆知识，所以把它们“带下埃及去”表示接受教导。关于这些事物，情况是这样：“埃及”所表示的记忆知识是指有助于属灵生活并对应于属灵真理的知识；因为在以前的时代，古教会也在埃及。但后来这个教会在那里沦落成巫术，故“埃及”表示败坏属灵事物的记忆知识。正因如此，在圣言中，“埃及”无论在正面意义上还是在反面意义上，都表示记忆知识（<a href="1164.htm">1164</a>，<a href="1165.htm">1165</a>，<a href="1462.htm">1462</a>节）；此处取正面意义。以实玛利人用骆驼驮着的“香料、乳香、没药”所表示的内层真理所基于的记忆知识，并不是教会所拥有的那类记忆知识，而是可见于外邦人当中的那类记忆知识。从可见于外邦人当中的记忆知识所获得的真理若不通过纯正教会所拥有的记忆知识，因而通过在这些记忆知识上的教导，就无法以任何其它方式得以纠正、变得正确。这些就是此处所表示的事。</p>

Going to carry them down to Egypt. That this signifies instruction in memory-knowledges is evident from the signification of "Egypt" as being memory-knowledges (n. 1164, 1165, 1462); and as by "spices, 
balsam, and stacte" are signified interior truths from the memory-knowledges of those who are in simple good, such as the Gentiles are in, therefore by "going to carry them down thither," is signified 
to be instructed. In regard to these things the case is this: the memory-knowledges which are signified by "Egypt" are those which conduce to spiritual life, and which correspond to spiritual truths; 
for formerly the Ancient Church was in Egypt also; but after it had been there turned into magic, the memory-knowledges which pervert spiritual things were signified by "Egypt." Thence it is that 
memory-knowledges in a good, and also in the opposite, sense, are signified in the Word by "Egypt" (n. 1164, 1165, 1462); and here in a good sense. The memory-knowledges from which are the interior truths 
signified by the Ishmaelites' carrying on camels spices, balsam, and stacte, are not such as are of the church, but such as are with the Gentiles. The truths from these memory-knowledges cannot be 
corrected and made sound by any other means than by the memory-knowledges of the genuine church, thus by instruction in these. This is what is here signified. </p>

<p align="center"><b>Elliott(1983-1999) 4749</b></p><p><b>4749.</b>
'Taking them down to Egypt' means teaching based on factual knowledge. This is clear from the meaning of 'Egypt' as facts, dealt with in <a href="1164.htm">1164</a>, <a href="1165.htm">1165</a>, <a href="1462.htm">1462</a>; and because 'spices, resin, and stacte' means 
interior truths based on the facts possessed by those in whom simple good is present, like that present in gentiles, therefore 'taking them down to that place' means receipt of teaching. The position 
is this: The facts meant by 'Egypt' are facts which contribute to spiritual life and correspond to spiritual truths, for in former times the Ancient Church had existed there also. But once the Church 
there had been turned into magic, facts which pervert spiritual things were meant after that by 'Egypt'. This explains why facts are meant in the Word, both in the good sense and in the contrary sense, 
by 'Egypt', see <a href="1164.htm">1164</a>, <a href="1165.htm">1165</a>, <a href="1462.htm">1462</a>; in this case in the good sense. </p>
<p></p>
<p><b>[2]</b>
 The factual knowledge on which the interior truths meant by the spices, resin, and stacte which the Ishmaelites were carrying 
on their camels are based are not the kind of facts which the Church possesses but the kind found among gentiles. The truths obtained from these facts found among gentiles cannot receive correction 
and be made sound except by means of the facts which the genuine Church possesses, and so by instruction in those facts. These are the matters meant at this point. </p>

</p><b>4749.</b>
`Euntes ad deferendum ad Aegyptum': quod significet instructionem in scientificis, constat a significatione `Aegypti' quod sint scientifica, de qua n. 1164, 1165, 1462, et quia per `aromata, resinam 
et stacten' significantur vera interiora ex illorum scientificis qui in bono simplici sunt in quali gentes, idcirco per `ire ad deferendum illuc' significatur {1} instrui.  Haec ita se habent: scientifica 
quae significantur per `Aegyptum,' sunt scientifica quae conducunt vitae spirituali et quae correspondent veris spiritualibus; olim enim {2} Ecclesia Antiqua etiam ibi fuerat, sed postquam 
illa ibi versa est in magiam, dein scientifica quae pervertunt spiritualia per `Aegyptum' significata sunt; inde est quod scientifica in bono sensu et in opposito in Verbo significentur per `Aegyptum,' 
videantur n. 1164, 1165, 1462, hic in bono sensu; [2] scientifica ex quibus vera interiora quae significantur per `quod Jishmaelitae super camelis ferrent aromata, resinam et stacten', sunt 
talia quae non sunt Ecclesiae qualia apud gentes; haec vera ex his scientificis non aliter emendantur et sanantur quam per scientifica genuinae Ecclesiae, ita per instructionem in his; haec sunt quae 
hic significantur.      @1 est$      @2 nam$ </p>
