<h4 align="center"></h4><p><strong>8233.</strong>出埃及记14:29-31.以色列人却走在海中间的干地上，水在他们的左右给他们作了墙垣。当日，耶和华这样拯救以色列脱离埃及人的手，以色列看见埃及人死在海岸上。以色列看见耶和华向埃及人所施展的大手，百姓就敬畏耶和华，又信服耶和华和祂的仆人摩西。<br />“以色列人却走在海中间的干地上”表那些处于真理之良善和良善之真理的人安全通过这地狱，没有受到侵扰。“水在他们的左右给他们作了墙垣”表他们被阻离四面八方的虚假。“当日，耶和华这样拯救以色列脱离埃及人的手”表在这种状态下，主保护那些属于属灵教会的人免受因邪恶所生的虚假而造成的一切暴力。“以色列看见埃及人死在海岸上”表看见受到诅咒者被分散到四处。“以色列看见耶和华向埃及人所施展的大手”表承认主的全能。“百姓就敬畏耶和华”表崇拜。“又信服”表信仰和信靠。“耶和华和祂的仆人摩西”表神性良善和从祂发出的神性真理方面的主，以及服事。</p>

Verses 29-31. And the sons of Israel went on the dry into the midst of the sea; and the waters were a wall to them on their right hand, and on their left. And Jehovah saved Israel on this day out of 
the hand of the Egyptians; and Israel saw the Egyptians dead upon the seashore. And Israel saw the great hand which Jehovah wrought on the Egyptians, and the people feared Jehovah; and they believed in 
Jehovah, and in His servant Moses. "And the sons of Israel went on the dry into the midst of the sea," signifies that they who were in the good of truth and the truth of good passed safely through that 
hell without infestation; "and the waters were a wall unto them on their right hand, and on their left," signifies that they were withheld from falsities on every side; "and Jehovah saved Israel on 
this day out of the hand of the Egyptians," signifies that in this state the Lord protected those who were of the spiritual church from all violence by reason of falsities from evil; "and Israel saw 
the Egyptians dead upon the seashore," signifies the view of the damned scattered here and there; "and Israel saw the great hand which Jehovah wrought on the Egyptians," signifies the acknowledgment 
of the Lord's omnipotence; "and the people feared Jehovah," signifies adoration; "and they believed," signifies faith and trust; "in Jehovah, and in His servant Moses," signifies the Lord as to Divine 
good, and as to Divine truth proceeding from Him and ministering. </p>

Verses 29-31 And the children of Israel went on dry ground into the middle of the sea; and the waters were a wall for them on their right and on their left. And Jehovah saved Israel on that day from 
the hand of the Egyptians; and Israel saw the Egyptians dead on the seashore.

in Jehovah and in Moses His servant. </p>
<p>'And the children of Israel went on dry ground into the middle of the sea' means that those governed by the good of truth and guided by the truth of good passed 
through that hell in safety without suffering molestation. 'And the waters were a wall for them on their right and on their left' means that they were held back from falsities on every side. 'And 
Jehovah saved Israel on that day from the hand of the Egyptians' means that in this state the Lord protected those belonging to the spiritual Church from any violence on the part of falsities arising 
from evil. 'And Israel saw the Egyptians dead on the seashore' means the sight of the damned dispersed this way and that. 'And Israel saw the great hand which Jehovah displayed among the Egyptians' 
means acknowledgement of the Lord's almighty power. 'And the people feared Jehovah' means adoration. 'And they believed' means faith and trust. 'In Jehovah and in Moses His servant' means the Lord in 
respect of Divine Goodness, and in respect of Divine Truth going forth from Him and ministering.

Vers. 29-31.  Et filii Israelis iverunt in arido in medium maris, et aquae illis murus a dextra illorum et a sinistra illorum.  Et salvavit Jehovah in die hoc Israelem e manu Aegyptiorum; et vidit Israel 
Aegyptios mortuos super litore maris.  Et vidit Israel manum magnam quam fecit Jehovah in Aegyptiis; et timuerunt populus Jehovam, et crediderunt in Jehovam, et in Moschen servum Ipsius.  `Et filii 
Israelis iverunt in arido in medium maris' significat quod qui in bono veri et (x)vero boni tuto absque infestatione transirent id infernum: `et aquae illis murus a dextra illorum et a sinistra illorum' 
significat quod a falsis detenti fuerint undequaque: `et salvavit Jehovah in die hoc Israelem e manu Aegyptiorum' significat quod Dominus in hoc statu tutatus sit illos qui ab Ecclesia spirituali 
ab omni violentia ex falsis (c)a malo: `et vidit Israel Aegyptios mortuos in litore maris' significat aspectum damnatorum hinc inde {1} dispersorum: `et vidit Israel manum magnam quam fecit Jehovah 
in Aegyptiis' significat agnitionem omnipotentiae Domini: `et timuerunt populus Jehovam' significat adorationem: `et crediderunt' significat fidem et fiduciam: `in Jehovam, et in Moschen servum Ipsius' 
significat Dominum quoad Divinum Bonum, et quoad Divinum Verum ab Ipso procedens et ministrans. 	@1 i ibi$ </p>
