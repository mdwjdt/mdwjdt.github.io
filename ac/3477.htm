<h3 align="center" class="ired">属天的奥秘 第3477节</h3>
<h4 align="center"></h4><p><strong>3477.</strong>前面说过，代表在天上不断出现，事实上，这类代表含有智慧的最深奥秘。从圣言的字义显现给人的代表相对来说极其稀少，少到如同小池溏里的水之于大洋里的水。在天上，代表的性质可以从我数次所讲述的亲身经历，以及下面的经历看出来：如我所亲眼看到的，圣言中所提到的宽路和窄路展现在一些灵人面前，宽路通向地狱，窄路通向天堂。宽路两边栽有树木和鲜花，以及其它诸如表面上看似美丽宜人的事物，但那里却隐藏着看不见的各种大小毒蛇。而窄路似乎没怎么装点树木和鲜花，反而显得悲伤、沉闷。然而，这条路上的婴孩天使打扮得最漂亮，置身于极其可爱的乐园和花园中，都是这些灵人未曾见过的。这时，他们被问及想走哪条路。他们说，走宽路。立时他们的眼就开了，他们在宽路上看到毒蛇，在窄路上看到天使。然后，他们又被问及想走哪条路，这一次他们不知所措，沉默不语了。只要他们的视觉被打开，他们就声称想走窄路；但只要他们的视觉被关闭，他们就想走宽路。</p>

It has been said that there are continual representatives in the heavens, and indeed such as involve the deepest arcana of wisdom. Those which are manifest to man from the literal sense of the Word are 
relatively as few as are the waters of a small pool as compared with those of the ocean. The nature of representatives in the heavens may be seen from what has been occasionally related above from 
things seen, and likewise from the following. There were represented before certain spirits, as I myself saw, a broad way and a narrow way such as are described in the Word; a broad way which led to hell, 
and a narrow way which led to heaven. The broad way was planted with trees, flowers, and the like that in outward form appeared beautiful and delightful, but unseen snakes and serpents of various 
kinds were hidden there. The narrow way did not seem to be so much adorned with trees and flowers, but appeared sad and dark; and yet there were in it angel infants most beautifully adorned, in delightful 
paradises and flower-gardens, which the spirits did not see. They were then asked which way they wished to go. They said, The broad way; when suddenly their eyes were opened, and in the broad way 
they saw the serpents, but in the narrow way the angels. They were then again asked which way they wished to go, whereupon they remained silent; and so far as their sight was opened, they said that 
they wished to go the narrow way; and so far as their sight was closed, that they wished to go the broad way. </p>

It has been stated that in heaven representatives are of constant occurrence, such representatives in fact as embody wisdom's deepest arcana. Those that are evident to man from the literal sense of the 
Word are comparatively few, as few as the waters of a tiny pond when compared to the waters of the ocean. What the representatives in heaven are like may become clear from what I have related several 
times already from things I have seen, and also from the following: To certain spirits, as I saw, there were represented the broad road and the narrow road mentioned in the Word - the broad road which 
would lead them to hell, and the narrow to heaven. The broad road was planted with trees and flowers, and other such things as in outward appearance looked beautiful and delightful. But various types 
of snakes and serpents which they did not see had been concealed there. The narrow road was not adorned in the same way with trees and flower-beds for the eye to see but looked sad and dreary. Yet 
there were along that road young angel-children adorned most attractively among very lovely tree-gardens and flower-gardens, which those spirits however did not see. They were at that point asked which 
road they wished to take. They said, The broad one. But all of a sudden their eyes were opened and they saw the serpents along the broad road, but the angels along the narrow one. They were then again 
asked which road they wished to take. This time they were at a loss and remained silent. As long as their sight was opened they said that they wished to take the narrow road; but as long as it was 
closed they said that they wished to take the broad one. </p>

</p><b>3477.</b>
Dictum est quod continua sint repraesentativa in caelis, et quidem talia quae involvunt arcanissima sapientiae; quae patent coram homine ex sensu litterali Verbi, sunt tam pauca respective sicut aquae 
oceani ad aquas parvuli lacus; qualia sunt repraesentativa in caelis, constare potest ab illis quae aliquoties prius ex visis relata sunt, et quoque ab his: repraesentata fuit coram aliquibus, quod 
vidi, lata via et stricta via, de qua in Verbo, lata quae duceret ad infernum, et stricta quae ad caelum; lata erat consita arboribus et floribus, et ejuscemodi quae externa forma apparebant pulchra 
et jucunda, sed absconditi (t)erant ibi varii generis angues et serpentes quos non videbant; stricta via non erat ita decorata arboribus et floretis ad visum, sed apparuit tristis et obscura, sed in illa 
erant angeli infantes pulcherrime decorati in paradisis et floretis amoenissimis, quae tamen non videbant; interrogabantur tunc quam viam ire vellent; dicebant latam, sed subito aperiebantur illis 
oculi, et in lata videbant serpentes, in stricta autem angelos; et tunc iterum interrogabantur quam viam ire vellent, tunc haerebant taciti; et quantum aperiebatur illis visus, dicebant se ire velle 
{1}strictam, et quantum claudebatur visus, se ire velle latam. @1 arctam$  </p>
