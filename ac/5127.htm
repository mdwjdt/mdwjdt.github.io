<h3 align="center" class="ired">属天的奥秘 第5127节</h3>
<h4 align="center"></h4><p><strong>5127.</strong>“像先前一样”表符合次序的法则。这从“像先前一样”的含义清楚可知，“像先前一样”是指次序的法则。按照次序的法则，外层事物要受内层事物支配，或也可说，低层事物要受高层事物支配，如仆人那样服侍它们。因为外层事物或低层事物无非是仆人，而内层事物或高层事物相对来说是它们的主人。“像先前一样”之所以具有这种含义，是因为正如酒政作为一个仆人以前服侍法老如他的主人符合服从的法则，“酒政”所代表的感官能力服侍“法老”所代表的内层属世层也符合次序的法则。<br />按照次序的法则，低层事物或外层事物要服侍高层事物或内层事物，这一事实完全不为感官人所知。因为纯感官人不知何为内层，因而也不知何为相对于内层的外层。他知道自己的思维和言语，意愿和行为，并由此以为思维和意愿是内层，言语和行为是外层。但他不知道这一事实：唯独基于感官的思维和唯独基于属世欲望的行为属于外在人，因此他的思维和意愿是唯独是其外层人的活动。当思想虚假，意愿邪恶时，他尤其不知道这一事实。由于在这种人里面，与内层事物的交流被关闭了，所以他不知道何为内层思维和内层意愿。他若被告知，内层思维就是基于真理思考，内层意愿就是基于良善行事，根本就不明白；若被告知内层人与外层人明显不同，彼此分离，并且如此不同以致内层人可以说从更高的位置来看待外层人中发生的一切，内层人拥有管教外层人的能力和权柄，也有能力不去意愿或思考外层人出于虚假观念所看见、出于恶欲所渴望的一切。<br />只要他的外在人掌权并统治，他就看不见这些事。但当他从这种状态出来时，如当他因不幸或疾病而陷入痛苦或悲伤时，就能明白并领悟这些事，因为那时外在人不再掌权了。事实上，人的理解能力或权柄一直被保存，但对那些沉浸于虚假与邪恶的人来说极其模糊；不过，随着虚假与邪恶处于休眠状态，它往往变得越发清晰。主的神性不断流入人，光照他，给他带来光明；但当虚假与邪恶，也就是违背真理与良善的事物存在时，神性之光要么被弃绝，要么被窒息，要么被扭曲。只有如同透过缝隙所接受的那点光亮使得他能利用通过感官所接受的观念思考和谈论，以及在铭刻于属世或身体记忆上的言语形式的帮助下思考和谈论属灵事物。</p>

After the former manner. That this signifies in accordance with the law of order is evident from the signification of the "former manner," as being the law of order; for it is a law of order that exterior 
things should be subject to interior things, or what is the same, lower things to higher ones, and should serve them as servants; for exterior or lower things are nothing but servants, while interior 
or higher things are relatively lords. That such is the signification of the words "after the former manner" is because the butler as a servant had previously served Pharaoh as his lord, in accordance 
with the law of subordination; thus the sensuous represented by the butler had served the interior natural represented by Pharaoh, in accordance with the law of order.  
 </p>
<p>[2] That it is the law 
of order that lower or exterior things should serve higher or interior things, is wholly unknown to the sensuous man; for one who is merely sensuous does not know what interior is, thus neither what is 
relatively exterior. He knows that he thinks and speaks, and that he wills and acts; and from this he supposes that to think and to will are interior, and that to speak and to act are exterior; but 
he does not know that to think from the senses only, and to act from the appetites, is of the external man, thus that his thinking and willing are solely of the exterior natural, and that this is still 
more the case when he thinks falsities and wills evils; and because in such persons the communication with interior things is closed, he therefore does not know what interior thought and will are. If 
he is told that interior thought is to think from truth, and that interior will is to act from good, he does not at all apprehend it; still less that the interior man is distinct from the exterior, 
and so distinct that the interior man can see as from a higher position what is going on in the exterior man, and that the interior man has the capacity and ability of chastening the exterior, and of 
not willing and thinking what the exterior man sees from phantasy, and desires from cupidity.  
 </p>
<p>[3] These things he does not see so long as his external man has dominion and rules; but when he is out 
of this state, as when he is in some depression arising from misfortunes or illness, he can see and apprehend these things, because then the dominion of the external man ceases. For the faculty or ability 
of understanding is always preserved to man by the Lord, but is very obscure with those who are in falsities and evils, and is always clearer in proportion as falsities and evils are lulled to sleep. 
The Lord's Divine flows in continually with man and enlightens him, but where there are falsities and evils (that is, where there are things contrary to truths and goods), the Divine light is either 
reflected or suffocated or perverted, and only so much of it is received, as it were through chinks, as to give him the faculty of thinking and speaking from sensuous things, and also of thinking 
and speaking of spiritual things from forms of speech impressed on the natural or bodily memory. </p>

<p align="center"><b>Elliott(1983-1999) 5127</b></p><p><b>5127.</b>
'According to the former manner' means in keeping with the law of order. This is clear from the meaning of 'the former manner' as the law of order. The law of order demands that exterior things should 
be subject to interior ones, or what amounts to the same, lower things should be subject to higher ones, serving them like domestic servants. Indeed exterior or lower things are nothing else than such 
servants, whereas interior or higher things in relation to them are their lords. The reason 'after the former manner' has this meaning is that as the cupbearer, being a servant, had previously served 
Pharaoh as his lord, in keeping with the law of subordination, so too was it in keeping with the law of order that the sensory power represented by 'the cupbearer' should serve the interior natural 
represented by 'Pharaoh'. </p>
<p></p>
<p><b>[2]</b>
 The fact that the law of order requires lower or exterior things to serve higher or interior ones is totally unknown to a person governed by his senses. For anyone who 
relies solely on his senses has no knowledge of what is interior, nor thus of what is exterior in relation to this. He knows about his thought and speech, and about his will and action, and from this 
presumes that thought and will are interior, speech and action exterior. But he is not aware of the fact that thought based solely on sensory experience, and action based solely on natural impulses, 
belong to the external man, so that his thought and will are activities of his exterior man alone. He is particularly unaware of this when his thoughts are false thoughts and his desires evil desires. 
And since in the case of anyone like him communication with his interiors is closed he therefore has no idea of what interior thought is or what interior will is. If he is told that interior thought 
is based on truth and that interior will is based on doing what is good, he does not begin to understand it. He understands still less if he is told that the interior man is distinct and separate from 
the exterior - so distinct that the interior man can, from a higher position so to speak, see what is going on in the exterior man - and that the interior man has the ability and power to discipline 
the exterior, and the ability not to will or think what the exterior man sees as a result of his having false notions and longs for as a result of his having evil desires. </p>
<p></p>
<p><b>[3]</b>
 As long as his external 
man is in control and reigning he sees none of this. But when not in this state, when for example he suffers any pain or grief owing to misfortune or sickness, he can see and grasp it because the 
external man ceases at that time to be in control. For a person's ability or power to understand is always preserved by the Lord, but it is largely obscured in the case of those steeped in falsities and 
evils, and is always more apparent as falsities and evils become dormant. The Lord's Divine is constantly coming to a person and bringing him light, but when falsities and evils are present, that is, 
things contrary to truths and forms of good, the light of the Divine is then either cast aside, smothered, or perverted. Just enough is received, through chinks so to speak, to allow him to think and 
to speak by the use of ideas received through the senses, and also to think and to speak about spiritual matters with the help of expressions registered in the natural or bodily memory. </p>

</p><b>5127.</b>
`Secundum morem priorem':  quod significet ex lege ordinis, constat ex significatione `moris prioris' quod sit lex ordinis; lex ordinis enim est ut exteriora subjecta sint interioribus, seu quod idem, 
inferiora superioribus, ac sicut famuli inserviant; sint enim exteriora seu inferiora nihil nisi quam famulitia, interiora autem seu superiora respective sunt dominia; quod [per] `secundum morem priorem' 
illa significatur, inde est quia pincerna ut servus prius inserviverat Pharaoni ut suo domino, ex lege subordinationis, ita sensuale quod per `pincernam' repraesentatur, interiori naturali quod 
per `Pharaonem', ex lege ordinis.  [2] Quod lex ordinis sit quo inferiora seu exteriora inservire debeant superioribus seu interioribus, homo sensualis prorsus nescit; qui enim mere sensualis 
est, non sit quid interius, ita nec quid respective exterius; novit quod cogitet et loquatur, et quod velit et faciat, inde autumat quod cogitare et velle sit interius, et quod loqui et facere 
sit exterius; sed non scit quo cogitare solum ex sensualibus, et facere ex {1}appetitu, sit externi homini, et sic quod cogitare et velle ejus sit solum exterioris naturalis, et magi adhuc cum cogitat 
falsa et vult mala; et quia apud illos communicatio clausa est cum interioribus, inde non scit quid interior cogitatio et interior voluntas; si ei dicitur quod interior cogitatio sit cogitare 
e vero, et interior voluntas sit {2}facere ex bono, hoc prorsus non capit, minus quod interior homo distinctus sit ab exteriore, ac ita distinctus ut interior homo quasi e loco superiore videre possit 
quid peragitur in exteriore homine, utque interior homo in facultate et potentia si castigandi exteriorem, et non volendi et cogitandi quod exterior homo ex phantasia videt, et ex cupiditate appetit; 
[3] haec quamdiu externus ejus homo in dominio est et regnat, non videt, ast extra illum statum, sicut dum in aliquo dolore est ex infortuniis aut morbis videre potest et capere, nam tunc dominium 
externi hominis cessat; facultas enim seu potentia intelligendi homini semper conservatur Domino, sed obscurissima est illis qui in falsis et malis sunt, et semper clarior prout falsa et mala 
sopiuntur; </p>
<p>influit {3} Divinum Domini continue apud hominem et illustrat, sed ubi falsa (c)et mala sunt, hoc est, ubi contraria veris et bonis, ibi Divina lux vel reflectitur vel suffocatur vel pervertitur, 
et solum tantum ejus quasi per rimas recipitur quo sit in facultate cogitandi et loquendi ex sensualibus, etiam {4}de spiritualibus ex formulis impressis memoriae naturali seu corporeae. @1
