<h3 align="center" class="ired">属天的奥秘 第457节</h3>
<h4 align="center"></h4><p><strong>457.</strong>几乎所有从尘世进入灵界者都以为，天堂和地狱对每个人来说都千篇一律。然而，二者的多样性和种种变化无穷无尽，没有哪个人的天堂和地狱与别人的一样，就象没有哪个人、精灵或天使与另一个相同一样。我仅仅思想两者完全相同或等同，精灵界的精灵和天堂天使就惊骇不已，他们说，每一个统一整体都是由众多部分和谐组成，整体依赖于这种和谐。实际上，绝对单一的整体不可能存在，只存在各组成部分和谐构成的整体。因此，诸天堂的每个社群构成一体，并且所有社群一起组成一体，即总体上的天堂，所有这一切唯独从主经由爱而来。有位天使仅数算精灵，即第一层天堂成员的喜乐最笼统的属，就列出四百七十八类，由此可以推断，每一属里面细化的属和种必定数不胜数。第一层天堂就有如此多的喜乐，那么天使灵天堂中快乐的属该是怎样的无穷无尽，天使天堂中的更是如此。</p>

<p><strong>[NCE]457.</strong> Almost all who come into the next life from the world think that hell is the same for everyone and heaven is the same for everyone, when in reality there are unlimited differences and variations in either case. Hell is never exactly the same for one person as for another, nor is heaven — just as there is never one person, spirit, or angel who is exactly the same as another.<br />When I merely entertained the thought that there could be two people precisely the same or identical, it aroused horror among those in the world of spirits and among the angels of heaven. "All unity is formed out of harmony among many," they said. "The way that the many harmonize determines what kind of unity they have. No monolithic unity lasts, only the unity created by harmony. So every community in the heavens forms a single unit, as do all the communities — or the whole of heaven — taken together. The Lord alone makes this happen, and he does so through love."<br />One angel calculated only the most general kinds of joy experienced by spirits (in other words, inhabitants of the first heaven) to be around 478. This indicated how countless the less general kinds must be, and how innumerable the specific kinds that make up each general kind. And considering how many kinds there are in that heaven, you can see how unlimited must be the kinds of happiness in the heaven of angelic spirits and how many more yet in the heaven of angels.{*1} <br /><strong>Footnotes:</strong><br />{*1} There is more detail on the three heavens in <a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_457/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_459" target=_top>459</a> just below; see also <a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_457/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_684" target=_top>684</a>, <a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_457/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_1642" target=_top>1642</a>, and the extended treatment of the subject in Swedenborg's <a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_457/swedenborg_heaven-and-hell-dole_29" target=_top>Heaven and Hell 29-40</a>.

Almost all who pass from this world into the other life suppose that hell is the same for everyone, and that heaven is the same for everyone. And yet in both there are endless, diversities and varieties, 
and neither the heaven nor the hell of one person is ever exactly like that of another; just as no man, spirit, or angel is ever exactly like another. When I merely thought of there being two exactly 
alike or equal, horror was excited in the inhabitants of the world of spirits and of the angelic heaven, and they said that everyone is formed by the harmony of many components, and that such as 
is the harmony, such is the one, and that it is impossible for anything to subsist that is absolutely a one, but only a one that results from a harmony of component parts. Thus every society in the heavens 
forms a one, and so do all the societies together, that is, the universal heaven, and this from the Lord alone, through love. A certain angel enumerated the most universal only of the genera of 
the joys of spirits, that is, of the first heaven, to about four hundred and seventy-eight, from which we may infer how innumerable must be the less universal genera and the species in each genus. And 
as there are so many in that heaven, how, illimitable must be the genera of happinesses in the heaven of angelic spirits, and still more so in the heaven of angels. </p>

Nearly everyone who enters the next life from the world imagines that hell is the same for everybody, and that heaven is too, when in fact there are limitless differences and variations in both. Hell 
is never exactly the same for one person as it is for another, and neither is heaven, just as one man, spirit, or angel is never given to be exactly like another. At my merest thought of two being exactly 
alike or equal, people in the world of spirits and those in the angelic heaven were horrified. They said that every unified whole is formed from the harmony of many constituent parts, and that that 
whole depended on this harmony. Indeed a simple whole cannot possibly exist, only a harmonized whole. Every community in heaven forms a whole in this way, and all the communities, that is, heaven 
in its entirety, form a whole. And all this derives from the Lord alone by means of love. A certain angel was counting up merely the most general classes of joy found among spirits, that is, among members 
of the first heaven. They came to about four hundred and seventy-eight. This demonstrated how countless the less general classes must be and how innumerable the divisions within each class. And with 
so many in the first heaven alone, how limitless must be the classes of happiness in the heaven of angelic spirits, and still more in the heaven of angels!  </p>

Fere omnes qui e mundo in alteram vitam veniunt, putant quod infernum sit simile unicuivis, et quod caelum sit simile unicuivis, cum tamen utrobivis indefinitae diversitates et varietates sint, et nusquam 
uni prorsus simile infernum, nec usquam uni prorsus simile caelum, ac alteri, sicut nusquam datur unus homo, spiritus ac angelus prorsus similis alteri: cum solum cogitarem quod bini essent prorsus 
similes aut aequales, horruerunt illi qui in mundo spirituum et qui in caelo angelico, dicentes quod omne unum formetur ex harmonia plurium, et quod tale unum sit qualis harmonia, et quod nusquam 
subsistere possit unum absolute sed unum harmonicum; ita omnis societas in caelis unum format, et omnes societates simul, seu universum caelum, unum, et hoc a solo Domino per amorem. Angelus quidam recensebat 
modo genera universalissima gaudiorum spirituum, seu primi caeli, circiter ad octo {1} et septuaginta et quadringenta: inde concludi potuit, quot innumera genera minus universalia, et quot innumerabiles 
species, quae sunt cujusvis generis; et cum tot ibi, quot indefinita genera felicitatum in caelo spirituum angelicorum, et adhuc magis in caelo angelorum. @	1 478 1.$ </p>
