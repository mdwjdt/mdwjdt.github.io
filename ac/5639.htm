<h3 align="center" class="ired">属天的奥秘 第5639节</h3>
<h4 align="center"></h4><p><strong>5639.</strong>“约瑟见便雅悯和他们同来”表属灵层的属天层对属灵的居间层与真理同在的觉知。这从“见”的含义，以及雅各的十个儿子和“便雅悯”的代表清楚可知：“见”是指理解和察觉（参看<a href="2150.htm">2150</a>，<a href="2807.htm">2807</a>，<a href="3764.htm">3764</a>，<a href="4567.htm">4567</a>，<a href="4723.htm">4723</a>，<a href="5400.htm">5400</a>节）；雅各的十个儿子，即“和他们同来”的“他们”，也就是约瑟看见便雅悯与之同在的他们所指的，是指属世层里面的真理（<a href="5403.htm">5403</a>，<a href="5419.htm">5419</a>，<a href="5427.htm">5427</a>，<a href="5458.htm">5458</a>，<a href="5512.htm">5512</a>节）；“便雅悯”是指居间层（参看<a href="5411.htm">5411</a>，<a href="5413.htm">5413</a>，<a href="5443.htm">5443</a>节）。在此之所以用“属灵的居间层”这个词，是因为雅各的十个儿子所代表的真理现在要与源于神性的真理，就是“约瑟”联结，但这种联结若不通过一个属灵的居间层，就无法实现；因此，这居间层一被察觉，约瑟就吩咐管家的人说：“将这些人领到屋里。要宰杀牲畜，预备筵席，因为晌午这些人同我吃饭”，以此表示他们要被引入并与他联结，因为他们与居间层同在。<br />有必要以三言两语进一步阐述一下与属世层相比，何为属灵层，因为在基督教界，绝大多数人对何为属灵层如此无知，以致当他们听到这个词时，茫然不知所措，对自己说，没有人知道何为属灵层。就其本质而已，存在于人身上的属灵层就是他为了良善与真理，而非自我的缘故而对良善与真理的真实情感，以及为了公义与公平，而非自我的缘故而对公义与公平的情感。当人在自己里面感觉到从它们所流出的快乐和愉悦，尤其感觉到幸福和祝福时，这些感觉就构成他里面的属灵层，这属灵层不是从自然界，乃是从灵界或天堂，也就是从主经由天堂来到他这里的。这就是属灵层，当它在人里面掌权时，就会感染他所思、所愿、所行的一切，可以说给它们着色，使他的思维和意愿行为享有属灵之物，直到最后，如当他离开自然界进入灵界之时，这些也变成他里面的属灵品质。简言之，属灵层就在于仁与信所激发的情感，也就是对良善与真理的情感，在于快乐与愉悦，尤其在于从它们所流出的祝福与幸福，这些都是人里面的内在感觉，并使他成为一个真正的基督徒。<br />在基督教界，绝大多数人不知道何为属灵层，这是因为他们将信，而非仁当成教会的本质。因此，由于关心信仰的少数人很少思考仁，或不知道何为仁，因而由于他们不知道仁爱的情感特征，或对这种情感特征没有觉知，所以凡未处于仁爱情感的人绝无可能知道何为属灵层。如今的情形尤其如此，几乎没有人拥有任何仁爱，因为现在是教会的末期。但要知道，就一般意义而言，“属灵层”是指对良善与真理这二者的情感，这就是为何天堂被称为灵界，圣言的内义被称为灵义。具体来说，属对良善的情感的，被称为属天层；属对真理的情感的，被称为属灵层。</p>

And Joseph saw Benjamin with them. That this signifies the perception by the celestial of the spiritual of a spiritual intermediate with truths, is evident from the signification of "seeing," as being 
to understand and perceive (see n. 2150, 2807, 3764, 4567, 4723, 5400); and from the representation of Jacob's ten sons (who are meant by "with them," that is, with whom Joseph saw Benjamin), as being 
truths in the natural (n. 5403, 5419, 5427, 5458, 5512); and from the representation of Benjamin, as being the intermediate (see n. 5411, 5413, 5443). That this is here called a spiritual intermediate 
is because the truths represented by Jacob's ten sons were now to be conjoined with the truth from the Divine which is "Joseph," and this conjunction is not effected without an intermediate which 
is spiritual; and therefore when this intermediate was perceived, it immediately follows that "Joseph said to him that was over his house, Bring the men to the house, and slaying slay, and make ready; 
for the men shall eat with me at noon," by which is signified that they would be introduced and conjoined because with the intermediate.  [2] What the spiritual is relatively to the natural must be 
further told in a few words, because most of those who are in the Christian world are so ignorant of what the spiritual is that when they hear the term they hesitate, and say to themselves that no one 
knows what it is. In its essence with man the spiritual is the very affection of good and truth for the sake of good and truth, and not for the sake of self, and also the affection of what is just and 
fair for the sake of what is just and fair, and not for the sake of self. When a man feels in himself delight and pleasantness, and still more if he feels happiness and blessedness, from these affections, 
this is the spiritual in him, which comes not from the natural, but from the spiritual world or from heaven, that is, through heaven from the Lord. This then is the spiritual, which when it reigns 
in a man, affects and as it were tinges all that he thinks, wills, and does, and causes the thoughts and the acts of his will to partake of the spiritual, until at last these also become spiritual 
in him, as when he passes out of the natural into the spiritual world. In a word, the affection of charity and faith, that is, of good and truth, and the delight and pleasantness, and still more the 
happiness and blessedness thence derived, which are felt inwardly in man and make him a man truly Christian, are the spiritual. [3] That most men in the Christian world are ignorant of what the spiritual 
is, is because they make faith and not charity the essential of the church. Consequently as those few who are concerned about faith think little if at all about charity or know what it is, therefore 
as there is no knowledge, there is no perception of the affection which is of charity; and he who is not in the affection of charity cannot possibly know what the spiritual is. Especially is this 
true at the present day, when scarcely anyone has any charity, because it is the last time of the church. But be it known that in a general sense the "spiritual" means the affection both of good and of 
truth, and therefore heaven is called the spiritual world, and the internal sense of the Word the spiritual sense; but specifically that which is of the affection of good is called the celestial, and 
that which is of the affection of truth is called the spiritual. </p>

'And Joseph saw Benjamin with them' means the discernment by the celestial of the spiritual that the spiritual intermediary was present with the truths. This is clear from the meaning of 'seeing' as 
understanding and discerning, dealt with in <a href="2150.htm">2150</a>, <a href="2807.htm">2807</a>, <a href="3764.htm">3764</a>, <a href="4567.htm">4567</a>, <a href="4723.htm">4723</a>, <a href="5400.htm">5400</a>; from the representation of the ten sons of Jacob - to whom 'with them', that is, the ones whom Joseph saw Benjamin with, 
refers - as the truths within the natural, dealt with in <a href="5403.htm">5403</a>, <a href="5419.htm">5419</a>, <a href="5427.htm">5427</a>, <a href="5458.htm">5458</a>, <a href="5512.htm">5512</a>; and from the representation of 'Benjamin' as the intermediary, dealt with in <a href="5411.htm">5411</a>, <a href="5413.htm">5413</a>, <a href="5443.htm">5443</a>. The reason the expression 
'spiritual intermediary' is used here is that the truths which are represented by 'the ten sons of Jacob' had now to be joined to truth from the Divine, which was 'Joseph'; but that joining together 
does not take place except through an intermediary that is a spiritual one. Therefore immediately after that intermediary had been recognized, Joseph told the man over his house, 'Bring the men 
to the house, and slaughter and prepare [an animal]; for the men will eat with me at midday', meaning that they would be brought in and joined to him because they were accompanied by the intermediary. </p>

A further brief statement needs to be made about what the spiritual compared with the natural is since the majority living in the Christian world do not know what the spiritual is. They are 
so ignorant of what it is that when they hear the term they are at a loss, saying to themselves, What the spiritual is, no one knows. Essentially the spiritual existing with a person is his actual affection 
for what is good and true, loved for its own sake and not for any selfish reason, as well as an affection for what is right and fair, likewise loved for its own sake and not for any selfish reason. 
When a person has inward feelings of delight and pleasure, and more so if feelings of blessedness and bliss flow from them, they constitute the spiritual present with him, which does not come to 
him from the natural world but from the spiritual world or heaven, that is, from the Lord by way of heaven. This then is the spiritual which, when it reigns in a person, influences and so to speak gives 
colour to everything he thinks, wills, or does, and which causes his thoughts and acts of will to partake of what is spiritual, till at length these too become spiritual qualities present with him 
when he passes from the natural world into the spiritual world. In short, the spiritual consists in an affection stirred by charity and faith, that is, an affection for what is good and true, and in the 
delight and pleasure, and even more so in the blessedness and bliss that flow from them, which are feelings residing with a person inwardly and making him someone truly Christian. </p>

<p><b>[3]</b>
 The majority 
in the Christian world are ignorant of what the spiritual is for the reason that they make faith, not charity, the essential virtue in the Church. Consequently, since the few who do bother about faith 
give little if any thought at all to charity or know what charity is, and since therefore they have no knowledge or any perception of the affection characteristic of charity, an affection that is 
not present in them, they cannot possibly know what the spiritual is. This is especially so at the present day when scarcely any charity exists with anyone, for now is the final period of the Church. 
But it should be recognized that in a general sense the spiritual means an affection both for what is good and for what is true, which is why heaven is called the spiritual world and the internal sense 
of the Word is called the spiritual sense. But more specifically what is essentially an affection for good is called the celestial, while that which is essentially an affection for truth is called the 
spiritual. </p>

`Et vidit Joseph cum illis Benjaminem':  quod significet apperceptionem medii spiritualis apud vera, a caelesti spiritualis, constat ex significatione `videre' quod sit intelligere et appercipere, 
de qua n. 2150, 2807, 3764, 4567, 4723, 5400; ex repraesentatione `decem filiorum Jacobi' qui sunt `cum illis', seu cum quibus Joseph vidit Benjaminem, {1}quod sint vera in naturali, de qua n. 5403, 5419, 
5427,5458,5512; et ex repraesentatione `Benjaminis' quod sit medium, de qua n. 5411, 5413, 5443; quod hic medium spirituale dicatur, est quia vera quae per `decem filios Jacobi' repraesentantur, 
nunc conjungenda erant cum vero a Divino quod 'Josephus', et conjunctio illa non fit nisi per medium quod spirituale; quare cum id medium apperceptum, tunc (x)statim sequitur `quod Josephus diceret ad 
virum super domo sua, Adduc viros domum, et mactando macta, et praepara, quia mecum comedent viri in meridie', per quae significatur quod introducerentur et conjungerentur quia cum medio. [2]Quid spirituale 
respective ad naturale, paucis adhuc dicendum, quia plerique qui in orbe Christiano ignorant quid spirituale, usque adeo ut cum audiunt vocem illam, haereant, et dicant secum quod spirituale quid 
sit, nemo sciat; spirituale in sua essentia apud hominem est ipsa affectio boni et veri propter bonum et verum et non propter se, tum affectio justi et aequi propter justum et aequum et non propter 
se; cum homo sentit in se jucundum et amoenum, et magis si faustum et beatum ex illis, hoc apud illum est spirituale quod non venit ex naturali sed ex spirituali mundo seu e caelo, hoc est, per caelum 
a Domino; hoc nunc est spirituale quod, cum apud hominem regnat, afficit et quasi tingit omne quod cogitat, quod vult et quod agit, et facit ut cogitata et ex voluntate acta participent ex spirituali, 
usque tandem ut cum e mundo naturali in mundum spiritualem transit, illa etiam apud (c)eum spiritualia fiant.  Verbo, affectio charitatis et fidei, hoc est, boni et veri, ac jucundum et amoenum, et 
magis faustum et beatum inde, quae interius apud hominem sentiuntur et illum faciunt hominem vere Christianum, est spirituale. [3]Quod plerique in orbe Christiano ignorent quid spirituale, est quia 
fidem faciunt essentialem Ecclesiae et non charitatem; inde quia pauci illi qui de fide solliciti sunt, parum si quicquam cogitant de charitate, et norunt quid charitas, inde quia non cognitio, nec est 
perceptio affectionis quae charitatis, et qui non in affectione charitatis est, nequaquam potest scire quid spirituale; imprimis hodie cum vix ulla charitas alicui est, quia est ultimum tempus Ecclesiae. 
 (m)Sed sciendum quod spirituale in communi sensu {2}significet affectionem tam boni quam veri, inde caelum vocatur mundus spiritualis, et sensus (t)internus Verbi sensus spiritualis, at in specie 
id quod est affectionis boni {3}vocatur caeleste, et id quod est affectionis veri, {4} spirituale.(n) @1 A had this clause after Jacobi, but d it; after Benjaminem A adds de qua n 2150..5400, an
