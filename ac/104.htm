<h3 align="center" class="ired">属天的奥秘 第104节</h3>
<h4 align="center"></h4><p><strong>104.</strong>今日之人不知何为觉。它是一种内在的意识，独出于主，能了知真理与良善。上古教会甚了解之。天使之觉十分完善，凭此觉，他们能了知真理与良善，分辨什么是出于主，什么是出于自己，也能透过一个人的气质，透过他的一个念头，洞察他的品性。属灵之人缺乏觉，但有良知，死人连良知也没有。很多人不知何为良知，更不知何为觉。</p>

<p><strong>[NCE]104.</strong> People today have no idea what perception is. It is an inner feeling for whether a thing is true and good — a feeling that can come only from the Lord — which was very familiar to the people of the earliest church. The sensation is so clear for angels that it gives them awareness and recognition of truth and goodness, of what comes from the Lord and what from themselves. In addition, it enables them to detect the character of anyone they meet simply from that person's manner of approach or from a single one of his or her ideas.<br />Spiritual people have no perception, although they have conscience. People who are lifeless do not even have conscience, and many do not know what conscience is, much less perception. </p>
<p align="center"><b>Potts(1905-1910) 104</b></p><p><b>104.</b>
At this day it is unknown what Perception is. It is a certain internal sensation from the Lord alone, as to whether a thing is true and good; and it was very well known to the Most Ancient church. This 
perception is so perfect with the angels, that by it they are aware and have knowledge of what is true and good; of what is from the Lord, and what from themselves; and also of the quality of anyone 
who comes to them, merely from his approach, and from a single one of his ideas. The spiritual man has no perception, but has conscience. A dead man has not even conscience; and very many do not know 
what conscience is, and still less what perception is. </p>

<p align="center"><b>Elliott(1983-1999) 104</b></p><p><b>104.</b>
Today people do not know what perception is. It is a certain inward feeling, wholly from the Lord, as to whether a thing is true and good. Such perception was fully known to the Most Ancient Church, 
and with the angels it exists so excellently that they know and recognize what is true and good, what comes from the Lord and what comes from self, and also the character of anyone who approaches them 
merely from the manner of his approach and merely from a single one of his ideas. The spiritual man has no perception, but he does have conscience. The dead man does not even have conscience. Nor do 
most people know what conscience is, much less what perception is.

</p><b>104.</b>
Sed quid perceptio, hodie ignoratur; est quaedam sensatio interna, quae unice a Domino, num verum ac bonum; Antiquissimae Ecclesiae notissima fuit; angelis tam manifesta ut sciant et norint inde quid 
verum et bonum, quid a Domino, et quid a semet, ut et qualis qui advenit ex solo ejus adventu, et ex una solum ejus idea: spirituali homini nulla est perceptio, sed est conscientia: mortuo homini ne 
quidem conscientia; plerique nec sciunt quid conscientia, minus quid perceptio.
