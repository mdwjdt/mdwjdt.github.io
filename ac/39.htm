<h3 align="center" class="ired">属天的奥秘 第39节</h3>
<h4 align="center"></h4><p><strong>39.</strong>创世记1:20 神说：“水要多多滋生能行动的活物；要有雀鸟飞在地面以上，天空之中。”<br />当两个大光被点亮并被安置于内在以后，外在从它们获得光明，人开始活了。此前，人不能说是活的，因为他以为他所行的良善和所说的真理都是出于自己。凭着自己，人是死的，内里只有邪恶和愚痴，所言所行皆不具生气。凭着自己，人不可能行真善。<br />根据信仰的教导，人不难看出，除非藉着主的大能，人不可能怀善意，持善念，行善举，如主所说：“那撒善种的是人子。”（马太福音<a href="http://39-27.cn/太13.37.htm">13:37</a>）善只可能出于善的唯一源头，如主所说：“除了独一之神，再没有良善的。”（路加福音<a href="http://39-27.cn/路18.19.htm">18:19</a>）<br />但是，当主使我们重生之初，他允许我们持有这些错误的观念。彼时，我们不可能持其它观念，也不可能相信并觉察一切良善与真理都是出于主。在此观念下，人所说的真理和所行的良善被比作“青草”，再而被比作“结种子的草本”，再而被比作“结果子的树木”，皆不具生气。<br />到了当前，当人被爱与信唤醒，开始相信他所行的良善和所说的真理都是出于主，就被比作“水中能行动的活物”和“空中的飞鸟”，再后被比作“牲畜”，皆具有生气，被称为“活物”。</p>

<p><strong>[NCE]39.</strong> <a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_39/bible_king-james-version_genesis_1_20" target=_top>Genesis 1:20</a>. And God said, "Let the waters cause the creeping animal — a living soul — to creep out. And let the bird flit over the land, over the face of the expanse of the heavens."<br />After the great lights are kindled and placed in the inner self, and the outer self is receiving light from them, the time arrives when we first start to live. Earlier, we can hardly be said to have been alive, thinking as we did that the good we perform and the truth we speak originate in ourselves. On our own we are dead and have nothing but evil and falsity inside, with the result that nothing we produce from ourselves has life. So true is this that by our own power we cannot do anything good — at least not anything inherently good.<br />From the doctrine taught by faith, anyone can see that we cannot so much as think a good thought or will a good result or consequently do a good deed except through the Lord's power. After all, in Matthew the Lord says:<br />The one who sows good seed is the Son of Humankind.{*1} (<a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_39/bible_king-james-version_matthew_13_37" target=_top>Matthew 13:37</a>)<br />Good cannot come from anywhere but this same unique source, as he also says:<br />Nobody is good except the one God. (<a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_39/bible_king-james-version_luke_18_19" target=_top>Luke 18:19</a>)<br />[2] Still, when the Lord brings us back to life, or regenerates us, he at first allows us to harbor these mistaken ideas. At that stage we cannot view the situation in any other way. Neither can we be led in any other way to believe and then perceive that everything good and true comes from the Lord alone.<br />As long as our thinking ran along these lines, the truth and goodness we possessed were equated with a tender plant or grass, next with a plant bearing seed, then with a fruit tree, none of which has a living soul. Now, when love and faith have brought us to life and we believe that the Lord brings about all the good we do and the truth we speak, we are compared initially to creeping animals of the water and birds flitting over the land and later to beasts. All these are animate and are called living souls.<br /><br /><strong>Footnotes:</strong><br />{*1} The Latin phrase here translated "the Son of Humankind" is Filius Hominis, traditionally rendered "the Son of Man." Elsewhere in this edition it has sometimes been rendered "the Human-born One." The force of the phrase is literally "someone descended from the human race," "someone who was born human," and therefore "someone human" (see <a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_39/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_49#subsection-2-3" target=_top>49:3</a>). It is difficult to estimate the original range of meaning of the term, however. In the Old Testament, the phrase almost always applies to a human being (as opposed to the Divine), and seems to encourage humility by emphasizing the person's mere humanness. In the New Testament it in most cases arguably denotes Jesus Christ, as Swedenborg clearly takes it to mean in the passage at hand; but scholars differ widely on whether it carries 1. the same humble force there as it does in the Old Testament, 2. a virtually opposite exalted and apocalyptic meaning, 3. some combination of the two, or 4. something else altogether.

Verse 20. And God said, Let the waters cause to creep forth the creeping thing, the living soul; and let fowl fly above the earth upon the faces of the expanse of the heavens. After the great luminaries 
have been kindled and placed in the internal man, and the external receives light from them, then the man first begins to live. Heretofore he can scarcely be said to have lived, inasmuch as the good 
which he did he supposed that he did of himself, and the truth which he spoke that he spoke of himself; and since man of himself is dead, and there is in him nothing but what is evil and false, therefore 
whatsoever he produces from himself is not alive, insomuch that he cannot, from himself, do good that in itself is good. That man cannot even think what is good, nor will what is good, consequently 
cannot do what is good, except from the Lord, must be plain to everyone from the doctrine of faith, for the Lord says in Matthew: </p>
<p>     He that soweth the good seed is the Son of man (Matt. 13:37). Nor 
can any good come except from the real Fountain of good, which is One only, as He says in another place: </p>
<p>     None is good save One, God (Luke 18:19). [2] Nevertheless when the Lord is resuscitating 
man, that is, regenerating him, to life, He permits him at first to suppose that he does what is good and speaks what is true from himself, for at that time he is incapable of conceiving otherwise, 
nor can he in any other way be led to believe, and afterwards to perceive, that all good and truth are from the Lord alone. While man is thinking in such a way his truths and goods are compared 
to the "tender grass" and also to the "herb yielding seed" and lastly to the "tree bearing fruit" all of which are inanimate; but now that he is vivified by love and faith, and believes that the Lord 
works all the good that he does and all the truth that he speaks, he is compared first to the "creeping things of the water" and to the "fowls which fly above the earth" and also to "beasts" which are 
all animate things, and are called "living souls." </p>

Verse 20 And God said, Let the waters bring forth creeping things, living creatures; and let birds fly above the earth, upon the face<A name="fntext1"></a><A href="#fn1"><sup>a</sup></a> of the expanse of the heavens. </p>
<p>After the great lights have been 
kindled and lodged in the internal man, from which the external man receives its light, a person starts to live for the first time. Till then he can hardly be said to have lived, for he had imagined 
that the good he had done he had done from himself, and the truth he had uttered he had spoken from himself. And since man functioning from himself is dead - there being nothing in him that is not evil 
and false - therefore whatever he brings forth from himself is not living. So true is this that of himself he is incapable of doing any good deed that is in itself good. The fact that man cannot begin 
to think about good or to will it, and so cannot do good, unless the Lord is the source, Is clear to everyone from the doctrine of faith, for the Lord says in Matthew,  </p>
<blockquote>
He who sows the good seed 
is the Son of Man. <a href="http://bible.gospelcom.net/cgi-bin/bible?passage=Matt%2013:37&amp;version=ESV&amp;interface=print&amp;showfn=yes&amp;showxref">Matt 13:37</a>.  
</blockquote>
<p>Nor can good come from anywhere else than the one fount itself of all good, as yet again He says,  </p>
<blockquote>
Nobody is good but one, God. <a href="http://bible.gospelcom.net/cgi-bin/bible?passage=Luke%2018:19&amp;version=ESV&amp;interface=print&amp;showfn=yes&amp;showxref">Luke 18:19</a>.

<p><b>[2]</b>
 Nevertheless 
when the Lord is revitalizing a person, or regenerating him, He does allow him, to begin with, to imagine that good and truth originate in himself, for at that point a person cannot grasp anything else, 
or be led to believe and finally perceive, that all good and truth come from the Lord alone. As long as he held the former opinion his truths and goods were comparable to 'a tender plant', then 'a 
plant bearing seed', and after that 'a fruit tree', which are inanimate But once he has been brought to life by love and faith and believes that the Lord is at work in every good deed he does and in 
every truth he utters, he is compared first to creeping things from the water and to birds which fly above the earth, and then to beasts, all of which are animate and are called 'living creatures'.

Vers. 20.  Et dixit Deus, Prorepere faciant aquae reptile, animam viventem; et avis volitet super terra, super faciebus expansi caelorum. Postquam magna luminaria accensa sunt et posita in homine interno, 
et inde lucem accipit externus, tunc incipit primum vivere; prius vix vixisse dici potest, nam bonum quod fecit, ex semet fecisse, et verum quod locutus, ex {x}semet dixisse, putavit; et quia homo 
est mortuus ex se, et in eo nihil nisi malum et falsum, quare quicquid producit ex se, non est vivum, usque adeo ut ne quidem facere bonum quod in se est bonum, ex semet possit: quod homo ne quidem 
cogitare bonum nec velle bonum, proinde non agere bonum, possit nisi ex Domino, ex doctrina fidei cuivis constat, nam dicit Dominus apud Matthaeum, 	Qui seminat bonum semen, est Filius Hominis, xiii 
37: </p>
<p>nec potest bonum nisi ex ipsomet fonte venire qui est unicus, sicut etiam dicit, 	Nemo bonus est nisi unus Deus, Luc. xviii 19. Sed usque cum Dominus resuscitat in vitam, seu regenerat, hominem, 
permittit primum ut sic autumet, nam homo tunc non aliter capere potest, nec aliter duci ad credendum, et dein ad percipiendum, quod a Domino Solo omne bonum et verum: dum ita autumavit, ejus vera 
et bona comparata sunt 'herbae tenerae,' tum 'herbae seminificanti semen,' dein 'arbori fructus,' quae sunt inanimata; nunc autem cum vivificatus ab amore et fide, et credit quod Dominus operatur omne 
bonum quod agit et verum quod dicit, tunc comparatur primum 'reptilibus aquae, et avibus, quae volitant super terra'; tum 'bestiis,' quae omnia sunt animata, et vocantur 'animae viventes.' </p>
