<h3 align="center" class="ired">属天的奥秘 第1705节</h3>
<h4 align="center"></h4><p><strong>1705.</strong>“幔利是以实各和亚乃的兄弟，这些就是与亚伯兰立约的人”表涉及外在人的理性人在其良善与真理的性质方面的状态。这从这些人的含义清楚可知，他们的含义将在提及他们名字的24节予以解释。简言之，幔利、以实各和亚乃代表和表示主在童年早期争战时同祂在一起的天使，他们就相当于那时主所具有的良善与真理。他们以这些良善与真理命名。天堂天使绝没有个人的名字，名字是根据良善与真理而赋予他们的。如圣言中提到的米迦勒和其他天使并非叫这类名字的天使，他们因自己所担任的职责而拥有这些名字，无论这职责是什么。此处幔利、以实各和亚乃的情形也一样，只是具有代表性。</p>

<p><strong>[NCE]1705.</strong> [Mamre was] brother of Eshcol and brother of Aner, and these were men bound by a pact with Abram symbolizes the state of his rational self (or of its outward part) and the nature of its goodness and truth. This can be seen from the symbolism of these men, which will be discussed below at verse <a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_1705/bible_king-james-version_genesis_14_24" target=_top>24</a> where they come up again [<a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_1705/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_1753" target=_top>1753-1754</a>].<br />To put it briefly, Mamre, Eshcol, and Aner represent and symbolize the angels present with the Lord during the battles of his early youth, who were suited to the goodness and truth he then possessed. They are named for the individual varieties of goodness and truth in him. Angels in heaven never have any names; it is on the basis of their goodness and truth that names are applied to them. Michael and other angels named in the Word, for instance, never go by those names; the names are based on the function they perform, whatever it is.{*1} The same is true of Mamre, Eshcol, and Aner here, but in a representative way.<br /><br /><strong>Footnotes:</strong><br />{*1} Swedenborg says a little more about names below in <a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_1705/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_1754" target=_top>1754</a>, <a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_1705/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_1876" target=_top>1876</a>.

All there are named for what they are like."

The brother of Eshcol, and the brother of Aner, and these were men of the covenant of Abram. That by these is signified the state of the rational man in respect to the external man, as regards the quality 
of its goods and truths, may be seen from their signification as explained below at verse 24, where also they are named. In brief, by Mamre, Eshcol, and Aner, are represented and signified the angels 
who were with the Lord when He fought in His earliest childhood, and who were adapted to the goods and truths then with the Lord. They are named from these goods and truths. In no case does an angel 
in heaven have any name; it is goods and truths from which names are predicated of them; for instance, "Michael" and the other angels named in the Word are not angels with such names; but they bear 
these names from the office they fill, whatever it may be. It is the same here with Mamre, Eshcol, and Aner; but representatively.  </p>

<p align="center"><b>Elliott(1983-1999) 1705</b></p><p><b>1705.</b>
'The brother of Eshkol and the brother of Aner, and these men were Abram's allies' means the state of the Rational Man in relation to the External Man as regards the nature of its goods and truths. This 
becomes clear from the meaning of these same men, discussed below at verse 24, where also they are mentioned by name. To put it briefly, Mamre, Eshkol, and Aner represent and mean the angels residing 
with the Lord when in earliest childhood He engaged in conflict, who were sufficiently equal to the goods and truths present with the Lord at that time. It is from goods and truths that angels receive 
their names. No angel in heaven has any personal name, but it is goods and truths from which names are bestowed on them, as with Michael and other angels mentioned in the Word. These are not angels 
possessing such personal names but angels so named because of the function they perform, whatever this may be. It is similar here with Mamre, Eshkol, and Aner, though these names are used representatively. </p>

'Fratris Eshkoli et fratris Aneri, et hi viri foederis Abrami quod significent statum Rationalis Hominis quoad Externum, ejus bona et vera qualia essent, constare potest a significatione illorum de 
quibus infra ad vers. 24 ubi quoque nominantur: ut paucis dicatur, per 'Mamre, Eshkol et Anerum' repraesentantur et significantur angeli qui apud Dominum, cum in prima pueritia pugnavit, qui adaequati 
fuerunt bonis et veris tunc apud Dominum; ex bonis et veris nominantur; nusquam aliquis angelus in caelo aliquod nomen habet, sed sunt bona et vera, ex quibus praedicantur nomina, sicut Michael et alii 
angeli in Verbo, nusquam tales sunt, sed ita nominantur ex officio qualicumque sunt: hic 'Mamre, Eshkol et Aner' similiter sed repraesentative. </p>
