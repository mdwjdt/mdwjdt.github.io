<h4 align="center"></h4><p><strong>2591.</strong>然而，和基督徒一样，外邦人也有智有愚。我被允许与这两种人交谈，有时几个时辰甚至几天，好让我得知他们的情况。不过，如今，这样的智者几乎没有了。但在古代，这种人非常多，尤其在古教会，古教会能传播到众多国家靠得就是它的智慧。我得以与其中一些智者交谈，好叫我了解他们的特性。从下文清楚看出，他们的智慧远远胜过当今的智慧。</p>

Among the Gentiles however, just as among Christians, there are both the wise and the simple. In order that I might be instructed as to the quality of these, it has been granted me to speak with both 
wise and simple, sometimes for hours and days. But of the wise there are scarcely any at this day, whereas in ancient times there were very many, especially in the Ancient Church, from which wisdom emanated 
to many nations. In order that I might know of what quality these were, I have been allowed to hold familiar converse with some of them; so that the nature of their wisdom, and its superiority 
to that of the present day may be seen from what follows. </p>

Among the gentiles however, as among Christians, there are both the wise and the simple. To inform me of the character of such I have been allowed to talk to both, sometimes for hours and days. But the 
wise number scarcely any at the present day, whereas in ancient times they were very many, especially in the Ancient Church from which wisdom spread to many nations. So that I might know what they 
were like I have been allowed to hold intimate conversations with some of them - the superiority of their wisdom to that of today consequently being made clear in what follows. </p>

Sed sunt inter gentiles sicut inter Christianos, sapientes et simplices; ut instruerer quales sunt, cum illis et his datum est loqui, quandoque per horas et dies; sed qui sapientes, hodie vix aliqui 
sunt, sed perplures antiquis temporibus, imprimis in Antiqua Ecclesia, a qua sapientia emanavit ad (t)plures gentes; ut scirem quales fuerunt, cum quibusdam in familiari sermone esse datum: qualis itaque 
eorum sapientia prae hodierna fuit, ex his quae sequuntur constare potest. </p>
