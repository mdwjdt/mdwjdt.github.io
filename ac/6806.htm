<h3 align="center" class="ired">属天的奥秘 第6806节</h3>
<h4 align="center"></h4><p><strong>6806.</strong>“神也认识（他们）”表祂赐予（它）仁。这从“认识”的含义清楚可知，“认识（或知道、晓得）”当论及神，也就是主时，是指赐予仁。因为正是仁将主与人联结起来，并使主与他同住，从而知道他。诚然，主知道宇宙中的所有人；但除了那些处于爱与仁之良善的人外，祂不会像一个父亲认识自己的儿子那样认识任何人。<br />这解释了为何主论到那些处于良善的人，就称之为祂的“羊”：<br />我是好牧人，我认识那属我的，那属我的也认识我。我的羊听我的声音，我也认识他们，他们也跟着我。（约翰福音<a href="http://39-27.cn/约10.14.htm">10:14</a>，<a href="http://39-27.cn/约10.27.htm">27</a>）<br />但论到那些陷入邪恶的人，主在这些经文中说，祂“不认识他们”：<br />当那日，必有许多人对我说，主啊，主啊，我们不是奉你的名说预言，奉你的名赶鬼，奉你的名行许多异能吗？我必向他们声明，我从来不认识你们，你们这些作恶的人，离开我去吧！（马太福音<a href="http://39-27.cn/太7.22.htm">7:22</a>-<a href="http://39-27.cn/太7.23.htm">23</a>）<br /><br />其余的童女，随后也来了，说，主啊，主啊，给我们开门。祂却回答说，我实在告诉你们，我不认识你们。（马太福音<a href="http://39-27.cn/太25.11.htm">25:11</a>-<a href="http://39-27.cn/太25.12.htm">12</a>）<br />及至家主起来关了门，你们开始站在外面叩门，说，主啊，主啊，给我们开门！祂必回答你们说，我不晓得你们是哪里来的！那时，你们将开始说，我们在你面前吃过、喝过，你也在我们的街上教训过人。祂要说，我告诉你们，我不晓得你们是哪里来的。你们这一切作恶的人，离开我去吧！（路加福音<a href="http://39-27.cn/路13.25.htm">13:25</a>-<a href="http://39-27.cn/路13.27.htm">27</a>）<br />由此明显可知，“认识（或晓得、知道）”当论及主时，是指处于仁之良善，也就是赐予那良善，因为一切仁之良善皆来自主；“不认识（或不晓得、不知道）是指陷入邪恶。“认识（或晓得、知道）”含有结合的意思；可以说主有多认识一个人，取决于他与主结合到什么程度。主也知道那些没有结合的人，甚至知道这种人当中每一个的一切最小细节（约翰福音<a href="http://39-27.cn/约2.24.htm">2:24</a>，<a href="http://39-27.cn/约2.25.htm">25</a>）；但这些人因陷入邪恶，故会经历不同的同在，这种同在更像是不同在；这并不意味着主不同在，但陷入邪恶的世人和灵人就是那不同在的人，这种不同在就是主不认识他们所描述的。天使和灵人当中也有类似现象；生命状态相似的，彼此看似离得近，他们因此互相认识。相反，生命状态不相似的，彼此则看似离得远，他们也因此互相不认识。总之，在来世，状态的相似性使人们显得同在，并且认识；而状态的非相似性则使他们显得不同在，并且不认识。</p>

And God took knowledge. That this signifies that He endowed with charity, is evident from the signification of "knowing," when predicated of God, that is, of the Lord, as being to endow with charity; 
for it is charity which conjoins the Lord with man, and causes the Lord to be present with him, consequently to know him. The Lord indeed knows all in the universe, but not as a father his sons except 
those who are in the good of love and charity. [2] Therefore the Lord says of those who are in good, whom He calls His "sheep": </p>
<p>     I am the good shepherd, and I know Mine own, and I am known of 
Mine. My sheep hear My voice, and I know them, and they follow Me (John 10:14, 27).      But of those who are in evil, the Lord says that He "does not know them," in these passages: </p>
<p>     Many will say 
to Me in that day, Lord, Lord, have we not prophesied through Thy name, and through Thy name have cast out demons, and in Thy name done many mighty deeds? But then will I confess to them, I know you 
not: depart from Me, ye workers of iniquity (Matt. 7:22-23).      At last came also the other virgins saying. Lord, Lord, open to us. But He answering said, Verily I say unto you, I know you not (Matt. 
25:11-12).      When once the master of the house hath risen up, and hath shut to the door, then will ye begin to stand without, and to knock at the door, saying, Lord, Lord, open to us; but He 
shall answer and say to you, I know you not whence ye are; then shall ye begin to say, We have eaten and drunk in Thy presence, and Thou hast taught in our streets; but He shall say, I say to you, I know 
you not whence ye are; depart from Me, all ye workers of iniquity (Luke 13:25-27). Hence it is plain that "to be known," when said of the Lord, is to be in the good of charity, that is, to be endowed 
with that good, because all the good of charity comes from the Lord; and that "not to be known" is to be in evil. [3] "To know" involves conjunction, and man is said to be "known" by the Lord insofar 
as he is conjoined with Him. The Lord also knows those who are not conjoined, nay, the very smallest particulars in every such man (John 2:24, 25); but these men, being in evil, are in a different 
kind of presence, which is as it were absence; although the Lord is not absent, but the man and the spirit who is in evil is he who is absent; and then it is said that the Lord "does not know" them. 
An image of this condition appears among angels and spirits; they who are alike as to states of life appear near each other, and thus mutually know each other; but they who are unlike as to states of 
life, appear to each other to be far away, nor do they know each other in the same way. In a word, in the other life likeness of state causes people to appear present, and to be known; and unlikeness 
of state causes them to appear absent, and not to be known. </p>

'And God knew them' means that He endowed it with charity. This is clear from the meaning of 'knowing' - when used in reference to God, that is, to the Lord - as endowing with charity. For charity is 
what joins the Lord and man together and what causes the Lord to be present with him and consequently know him. The Lord, it is true, knows all people everywhere; but He knows none in the way a father 
does his children except those who are governed by the good of love and charity. </p>
<p></p>
<p><b>[2]</b>
 This explains why the Lord says of those who are governed by good, whom He calls His own sheep, </p>
<blockquote>
I am the good 
Shepherd; and I know those who are My own, and am known by those who are My own. My sheep hear My voice, and I know them, and they follow Me. <a href="http://bible.gospelcom.net/cgi-bin/bible?passage=John%2010:14,%2027&amp;version=ESV&amp;interface=print&amp;showfn=yes&amp;showxref">John 10:14, 27</a>. 
</blockquote>
<p>But the Lord says of those who are governed 
by evil that He does not know them in Matthew, </p>
<blockquote>
Many will say to Me on that day, Lord, Lord, did we not prophesy by Your name, and by Your name cast out demons, and do many mighty works in Your 
name? But then I will declare to them, ! do not know you; depart from Me, you workers of iniquity. <a href="http://bible.gospelcom.net/cgi-bin/bible?passage=Matt%207:22,%2023&amp;version=ESV&amp;interface=print&amp;showfn=yes&amp;showxref">Matt 7:22, 23</a>. 
</blockquote>
<p>In the same gospel, </p>
<blockquote>
At length the remaining virgins came also, saying, Lord, 
Lord, open to us. But He replying said, Truly, I say to you, I do not know you. <a href="http://bible.gospelcom.net/cgi-bin/bible?passage=Matt%2025:11,%2012&amp;version=ESV&amp;interface=print&amp;showfn=yes&amp;showxref">Matt 25:11, 12</a>.  
</blockquote>
<p>In Luke, </p>
<blockquote>
Once the Householder has risen up and shut the door, then you will begin to stand outside 
and to knock at the door, saying, Lord, Lord, open to us. But He replying will say to you, ! do not know where you come from. Then you will begin to say, We ate in Your presence and we drank; and 
You taught in our streets. But He will say, I tell you, I do not know where you come from; depart from Me, all you workers of iniquity! <a href="http://bible.gospelcom.net/cgi-bin/bible?passage=Luke%2013:25-27&amp;version=ESV&amp;interface=print&amp;showfn=yes&amp;showxref">Luke 13:25-27</a>. 
</blockquote>

<p><b>[3]</b>
 From this it is evident that the expression 
'being known', when used by the Lord, means being governed by the good of charity, that is, being endowed with that good; for the good of charity comes entirely from the Lord. And the expression 'not 
being known' means being governed by evil. 'Knowing' implies being joined together; and how far a person is said to be known by the Lord depends on how far he has become joined to Him. The Lord does 
also know those who have not become joined, indeed He knows the tiniest details of every individual person, <a href="http://bible.gospelcom.net/cgi-bin/bible?passage=John%202:24,%2025&amp;version=ESV&amp;interface=print&amp;showfn=yes&amp;showxref">John 2:24, 25</a>; but because those people are governed by evil they experience a different kind 
of presence, which is more like absence. This does not mean that the Lord is absent; rather, the person or the spirit governed by evil is the one who is absent, and that absence is what the Lord's 
not knowing them describes. Something comparable to this occurs among angels and spirits whose states of life are like one another's; they appear to be near one another and so they know one another. 
But those whose states of life are not alike appear to be distant from one another and for that reason do not know one another either. In short similarity of state causes people in the next life to be 
visibly present and to be known, while dissimilarity of state causes them to be absent to the sight and not to be known. </p>

`Et cognovit {1}illos': quod significet quod charitate, nempe donavit, constat ex significatione `cognoscere' cum praedicatur de Deo, hoc est, de Domino, quod sit donare charitate; charitas enim est 
quae conjungit Dominum cum homine, et facit ut Dominus praesens sit apud illum, consequenter ut cognoscat illum; Dominus quidem omnes in universo cognoscit, sed non sicut pater filios quam illos qui 
2 in bono amoris et charitatis sunt; idcirco Dominus dicit de illis qui in bono sunt, (x)quos oves Suas vocat, Ego sum Pastor bonus, et cognosco Meos, et cognoscor a Meis: oves Meae vocem Meam audiunt, 
et Ego cognosco eas, et sequuntur Me, Joh. x 14, 27. At de illis qui in malo sunt, dicit Dominus quod illos non cognoscat; apud Matthaeum, Multi dicent Mihi in illa die, Domine, Domine, nonne per 
nomen Tuum prophetavimus, et per nomen Tuum daemonia ejecimus, et in nomine Tuo virtutes multas fecimus? sed tunc confitebor illis, Non cognosco vos; discedite a Me, operarii iniquitatis, vii 22, 23: </p>
<p>apud 
eundem, Tandem venerunt etiam reliquae virgines, dicentes, Domine, Domine, aperi nobis; Ille vero respondens dixit, Amen dico vobis, Non cognosco vos, xxv 11, 12: </p>
<p>apud Lucam, Ex quo surrexit 
paterfamilias, et occlusit januam, tunc incipietis foris stare, et pulsare januam, dicentes, Domine, Domine, aperi nobis; sed respondens dicet vobis, Non novi vos unde sitis: tunc incipietis dicere, 
Edimus coram Te, et bibimus, et in plateis nostris docuisti; sed dicet, Dico vobis, Non novi vos unde sitis; discedite a Me omnes, operarii iniquitatis, xiii 25-27; </p>
<p>inde patet quod {2}`cognosci' cum 
dicitur {3}a Domino, {4} sit in bono charitatis esse, hoc est, {4} sit donari illo bono, quia omne bonum charitatis venit a Domino; et quod `non {5}cognosci' sit in malo esse; `cognoscere' {6} involvit 
conjunctionem, et tantum cognosci dicitur 3 homo a Domino, quantum Ipsi conjunctus est; qui non conjuncti sunt, hos Dominus etiam cognoscit, immo singularissima apud unumquemvis, Joh. ii 24, 25, sed 
hi quia in malo sunt, in alia praesentia sunt quae quasi est absentia, tametsi Dominus non abest, sed homo (x)et spiritus qui in malo est qui abest, hoc dicitur quod Dominus non cognoscat illos; imago 
hujus rei apparet apud angelos et spiritus qui similes sunt quoad status vitae; illi apparent prope sibi esse et sic mutuo cognoscunt se; at qui dissimiles quoad status vitae sunt, illi apparent sibi 
e longinquo esse, nec ita cognoscunt (d)se; verbo, in altera vita, status similitudo facit quod praesentes {7}appareant et cognoscantur, et status dissimilitudo facit ut absentes {8}appareant, et non 
cognoscantur. 	@1 See 6797 footnote 1.$ 	@2 cognoscere$ 	@3 de$ 	@4 i quod AI$ 	@5 d cognoscere i cognosci$ 	@6 i enim$ 	@7 sint A apparent I$ 	@8 sint$ </p>
