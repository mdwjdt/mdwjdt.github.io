<h3 align="center" class="ired">属天的奥秘 第3379节</h3>
<h4 align="center"></h4><p><strong>3379.</strong>“又要将这些地都赐给你的种”表由此衍生的教会。这从“种”和“地”的含义清楚可知：“种”是指真理，因而是指那些拥有真理，并因此被称为“天国之子”的人（<a href="3373.htm">3373</a>节）；“地”是指被神性启示后而成为真理表象的理性事物（<a href="3368.htm">3368</a>节），因而是指那些具有被神性启示的理性事物之人，或也可说，那些居于天堂之光的人。由于只有那些处于主在天上的国度，就是天堂中的人，以及那些处于主在地上的国度，就是教会中的人居于天堂之光，故显然，“这些地”表教会。教会之所以为教会，并不是因为它们名为教会，也不是因为它们奉主之名，而是因为它们具有信之良善与真理。构成教会的，是信之良善与真理本身。事实上，它们就是教会，因为主在信之良善与真理中，主在哪里，哪里就是教会。</p>

<p align="center"><b>Potts(1905-1910) 3379</b></p><p><b>3379.</b>
And I will give unto thy seed all these lands. That this signifies the churches thence derived, is evident from the signification of "seed," as being truths, thus those who are in truths, who are on 
this account called the "sons of the kingdom" (n. 3373); and from the signification of "lands," as being the rational things which when enlightened by the Divine are appearances of truth (n. 3368); thus 
those who are in rational things that are enlightened by the Divine; or what is the same those who are in heavenly light; and as those only are in such light who are in the Lord's kingdom in the heavens 
(that is, in heaven) and who are in His kingdom on earth (that is, in the churches), it is evident that by these "lands" are signified the churches; for churches are not churches because they are 
so called, and because they profess the Lord's name; but because they are in the good and truth of faith. The good and truth of faith is that which constitutes the church, yea, which is the church, 
for in the good and truth of faith is the Lord, and where the Lord is, there is the church. </p>

<p align="center"><b>Elliott(1983-1999) 3379</b></p><p><b>3379.</b>
'And I will give to your seed all these lands' means derivative Churches. This is clear from the meaning of 'seed' as truths, and so those who possess truths and are consequently called 'the sons of 
the kingdom', dealt with above in <a href="3373.htm">3373</a>, and from the meaning of 'lands' as rational concepts which, when enlightened from the Divine, are appearances of truth, also dealt with above, in <a href="3368.htm">3368</a>, and so those 
with rational concepts enlightened from the Divine, or what amounts to the same, those who dwell in heavenly light. Since none but those who are in the Lord's kingdom in the heavens, that is, in 
heaven, and those who are in the Lord's kingdom on earth, that is, in Churches, dwell in that heavenly light, it is evident that 'these lands' means Churches. For Churches are not Churches on account 
of their being called such and of their confessing the Lord's name, but on account of the good and truth of faith that exist in them. Good and truth of faith themselves are what make a Church, indeed 
they are the Church, for present within the good and truth of faith there is the Lord, and where the Lord is, there is the Church also. </p>

<p align="center"><b>Latin(1748-1756) 3379</b>
</p><b>3379.</b>
`Et dabo semini tuo omnes terras has': quod significent inde Ecclesias, constat ex significatione `seminis' quod sint vera, ita illi qui in veris sunt, et inde vocantur `filii regni,' de qua supra n. 
3373; et ex significatione `terrarum' quod sint rationalia quae a Divino illustrata sunt apparentiae veri, de qua etiam supra n. 3368, ita illi qui in rationalibus a Divino illustratis sunt, seu quod 
idem, in luce caelesti, in qua luce quia solum sunt illi qui in regno Domini sunt in caelis, {1}hoc est, in caelo, et qui in regno Domini sunt in terris, {1}hoc est, in Ecclesiis, patet quod per `terras 
has' significentur Ecclesiae; Ecclesiae enim sunt non ex eo quod ita dicantur, et quod profiteantur Nomen Domini, sed quod sint in bono et vero fidei; ipsum bonum et verum fidei est quod facit Ecclesiam, 
immo quod est Ecclesia, nam in bono et vero fidei est Dominus, et ubi Dominus ibi Ecclesia. @1 seu$  </p>
