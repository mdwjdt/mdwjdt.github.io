Verses 2, 3. And he saw, and behold a well in the field, and behold there three droves of the flock lying by it; for out of that well they watered the droves, and a great stone was upon the well's mouth. 
And all the droves were gathered together thither; and they rolled the stone from the well's mouth, and watered the flock, and they put the stone in its place again upon the well's mouth. "And he 
saw" signifies perception; "and behold a well" signifies the Word; "in the field," signifies for the churches; "and behold there three droves of the flock lying by it," signifies the holy things of churches 
and of doctrinal things; "for out of that well they watered the droves," signifies that the memory-knowledge is thence derived; "and a great stone was upon the well's mouth" signifies that it 
was closed; "and all the droves were gathered together thither," signifies that all churches and their doctrinal things were thence derived; "and they rolled the stone from the well's mouth," signifies 
that they opened it; "and watered the flock," signifies that thence came doctrine; "and they put the stone in its place again upon the well's mouth," signifies that meanwhile it was closed. </p>

Verses 2, 3 And he saw, and behold, a well in the field, and behold, three droves of a flock there, lying nearby it; for out of that well they watered the droves; and there was a large stone over the 
mouth of the well. And all the droves would be gathered there; and they would roll the stone from over the mouth of the well and water the flock; and they would put the stone back in its place over the 
mouth of the well. </p>
<p>'He saw' means perception. 'Behold, a well' means the Word. 'In the field' means provided for the Churches. 'And behold, three droves of a flock there, lying nearby it' means 
the holy things that constitute the Churches and their matters of doctrine. 'For out of that well they watered the droves' means knowledge obtained from there. 'And there was a large stone over the mouth 
of the well' means that it was closed up. 'And all the droves would be gathered there' means that all the Churches and their doctrinal teaching come from there. 'And they would roll the stone from 
over the mouth of the well' means that they opened it up. 'And water the flock' means that the doctrine was drawn from it. 'And they would put the stone back in its place over the mouth of the well' 
means that it was closed up for the time being. </p>

Vers. 2, 3.  Et vidit, et ecce puteus in agro, et ecce ibi tres catervae gregis cubantes juxta illum, quia e puteo illo potarunt catervas; et lapis magnus super ore putei. Et colligebantur illuc 
omnes catervae, et devolvebant lapidem a super ore putei, et potabant gregem; et reducebant lapidem super os putei ad locum ejus. `Vidit' significat perceptionem: `ecce puteus' significat Verbum: `in 
agro' significat pro Ecclesiis: `et ecce ibi tres catervae gregis cubantes juxta illum' significat sancta Ecclesiarum et doctrinalium: `quia e puteo illo potarunt catervas' significat quod inde 
scientia: `et lapis magnus super ore putei' significat quod occlusum esset: `et {1}colligebantur illuc omnes catervae' significat quod omnes Ecclesiae et earum doctrinalia inde: `et devolvebant lapidem 
a super ore putei' significat quod recluderent: `et potabant gregem' significat quod inde doctrina: </p>
<p>`et reducebant lapidem super os putei ad locum ejus' significat quod interea esset occlusum. @1
