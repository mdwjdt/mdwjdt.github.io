<h3 align="center" class="ired">属天的奥秘 第6266节</h3>
<h4 align="center"></h4><p><strong>6266.</strong>“自己就脸伏于地下拜”表他们的谦卑。这从“脸伏于地下拜”的含义清楚可知，“脸伏于地下拜”是指内在的谦卑（参看<a href="5682.htm">5682</a>节）。因为这种下拜是一种对应于心智谦卑的身体行为。这解释了为何从心里敬拜神的人会以这种方式下拜。经上之所以说约瑟“自己下拜”，是因为约瑟代替他们而如此行；然而这时，他不是在以色列面前下拜，而是在主面前下拜，祝福经由以色列从主而来。<br />约瑟之所以代替他们如此行，是因为在属灵的事上，情况就是这样。属世层里面意愿的良善和理解力的真理凭它们自己没有能力在主面前谦卑自己；它们只能通过流注从内在拥有这种能力。事实上，若没有通过内在进入属世层的流注，那里根本没有意愿和理解力的任何东西，甚至根本没有生命的任何东西；因为内在是居间层或途径，生命通过这居间层或途径从主来到那里。</p>

<p align="center"><b>Potts(1905-1910) 6266</b></p><p><b>6266.</b>
And he bowed himself with his face to the earth. That this signifies their humiliation, is evident from the signification of "bowing himself with his face to the earth," as being interior humiliation 
(see n. 5682); for such bowing is a bodily act that corresponds to humiliation of mind; hence they who adore God from the heart, thus bow themselves. It is said "he bowed himself," because Joseph was 
in their stead, not then before Israel, but before the Lord, from whom was the blessing by Israel. That this was done by Joseph in their stead, is because such is the case in things spiritual; the good 
of the will and the truth of the intellectual in the natural cannot from themselves humble themselves before the Lord, but only from the internal by means of influx; for without influx through the 
internal into the natural, there is nothing of will and understanding therein, and not even anything of life; for the internal is the intermediate through which is life from the Lord therein. </p>

<p align="center"><b>Elliott(1983-1999) 6266</b></p><p><b>6266.</b>
'And bowed down, his face to the earth' means an expression of humility by them. This is clear from the meaning of 'bowing down, face to the earth' as an expression of interior humility, dealt with in <a href="5682.htm">5682</a>. For that kind of bowing down is an action performed by the body corresponding to humility of mind; and it explains why people who worship God in their hearts bow down in that manner. It is said 
that Joseph 'bowed down' because he was acting in place of them; yet he did not bow down before Israel but before the Lord, from whom the blessing came through Israel. </p>
<p></p>
<p><b>[2]</b>
 Joseph did it in place 
of them because of the situation in spiritual things. Good belonging to the will and truth belonging to the understanding within the natural possess no ability on their own to humble themselves before 
the Lord; they can possess it only if it flows in from the internal. In fact without an inflow through the internal into the natural, nothing at all of the powers of will and understanding are present 
there, nor indeed any life since the internal is the means through which life from the Lord comes to be there. </p>

</p><b>6266.</b>
`Et incurvavit se ad faciem (x)suam terram': quod significet humiliationem illorum, constat a significatione `incurvare se ad faciem terram' quod sit humiliatio interior, de qua n. 5682; incurvatio 
enim talis est actus corporis correspondens humiliationi mentis, inde illi qui in adoratione Dei ex corde sunt, ita incurvant se. `Incurvavit se' dicitur quia erat Josephus pro illis, non tunc coram Israele, 
sed coram Domino a Quo benedictio per Israelem.  [2] Quod hoc a Josepho factum sit pro illis, est quia ita se habet in spiritualibus; bonum voluntarii et verum intellectualis in naturali non se 
ex se humiliare possunt coram Domino sed ex interno per influxum; quippe absque influxu per internum in naturale, nihil ibi voluntatis et intellectus est, et ne quidem aliquid vitae, nam internum est 
medium per quod vita a Domino ibi. </p>
