<h3 align="center" class="ired">属天的奥秘 第10699节</h3>
<h4 align="center"></h4><p><strong>10699</strong>.“他就把耶和华在西乃山告诉他的一切话都吩咐他们”表关于从天上所揭示、将要被代表的首要真理的一个命令。这从“吩咐”和“耶和华在西乃山告诉他的”的含义清楚可知：当耶和华“吩咐”摩西时，“吩咐”是指一个命令（这个命令与将要被代表的首要真理有关，这一点可从以下事实明显看出来：所吩咐并包含在12-28节经文中的事是将要被代表的首要真理，以便这百姓能被接纳，参看<a href="10637.htm">10637</a>节）；“耶和华在西乃山告诉他的”是指从天上被揭示的事物。因为耶和华所告诉的话表示被揭示之物，“西乃山”表示天堂，神性真理来自天堂（<a href="9420.htm">9420</a>节）。</p>

And he commanded them all things that Jehovah had spoken with him in Mount Sinai. That this signifies a command concerning the primary truths which were to be represented, as revealed from heaven, is 
evident from the signification of "commanding," when by Jehovah unto Moses, as being a command; that it denotes a command concerning the primary truths which were to be represented, is evident from the 
fact that the things which were commanded, and which are contained in verses twelve to twenty-seven, were primary truths, which were to be represented so that they might be received (see above, n. 
10637); and from the signification of "which Jehovah had spoken with him from Mount Sinai," as being which were revealed from heaven; for by "Jehovah spoke" is signified what was revealed; and by "Mount 
Sinai" is signified heaven, from which is Divine truth (n. 9420). </p>

'And he commanded them all the things that Jehovah had told him on Mount Sinai' means a decree relating to the primary truths revealed from heaven that were to be represented. This is clear from the 
meaning of 'commanding', when Moses had been told things by Jehovah, as a decree (the fact that the decree was one that had to do with the primary truths that were to be represented is clear from the 
consideration that the things which were commanded, and which are contained in verses 12-28, were the main truths which were to be represented in order that the people might be accepted, see above in <a href="10637.htm">10637</a>); and from the meaning of 'which Jehovah had told him from Mount Sinai' as things which were revealed from heaven. For what has been told by Jehovah means that which has been revealed, and 'Mount 
Sinai' means heaven, from which Divine Truth comes, <a href="9420.htm">9420</a>.  </p>

`Et praecepit illis omnia quae locutus Jehovah cum illo in monte Sinai':  quod significet mandatum de primariis veris quae repraesentanda revelata e caelo, constat ex significatione `praecipere' cum 
a Jehovah ad Moschen, quod sit mandatum; quod sit mandatum de primariis veris quae repraesentanda, constat ex eo quod illa quae mandata sunt, et continentur versibus 12-28, fuerint primaria vera, quae 
repraesentanda ut reciperentur, videatur supra n. 10637; et ex significatione `quae locutus Jehovah cum illo e monte Sinai' quod sint quae revelata e caelo, nam per `locutus Jehovah' significatur {1}quod 
revelatum, et per `montem Sinai' caelum, e quo Divinum Verum, n. 9420. @1 quae revelata$ </p>
