<h3 align="center" class="ired">属天的奥秘 第7554节</h3>
<h4 align="center"></h4><p><strong>7554.</strong>“自从埃及创立之日以来，直到现在，没有这样的”表属世心智中的这种毁灭不会发生在其他任何人身上。这从“冰雹雨”和“埃及地”的含义清楚可知：这句话所论及的“冰雹雨”是指真理通过虚假而毁灭，如刚才所述（<a href="7553.htm">7553</a>节）；“埃及地”是指属世心智（参看<a href="5276.htm">5276</a>，<a href="5278.htm">5278</a>，<a href="5280.htm">5280</a>，<a href="5288.htm">5288</a>，<a href="5301.htm">5301</a>节）。“自从埃及创立之日以来，直到现在”表示属世心智中的这种毁灭不会发生在其他任何人身上，因为“日”表示状态，“创立”表示这种状态的性质，“埃及”表示总体上的属世心智。这种毁灭之所以不会像发生在那些在来世侵扰正直人的人身上那样发生在其他任何人身上，是因为那些如此侵扰的人在世时属于教会（<a href="7317.htm">7317</a>，<a href="7502.htm">7502</a>节）。他们就是那些将诸如属于从圣言和其教会的教义所获得的信的那类事物充满属于属世心智的记忆，然而却过着与这些事物相背的生活之人。因此，当他们经历荒凉时，属于信的这些事物就被拔掉，同时附着于这些事物的大量其它东西就留下深深且污秽的坑洞和沟壑。此外，这种人的恶欲，以及他们的虚假不可避免地在某种程度上与这些信之事物联系在一起。由于真理和虚假无法共存，故显而易见，它们若无法被分离出去，就必须被扔到一边，在里面留下散发恶臭的空余区域，因为一切恶臭皆由混杂着良善的邪恶和混杂着真理的虚假产生。这些事不会发生在那些在教会之外的人身上，因为他们对来自圣言的信之真理一无所知。这就是“属世心智中的这种毁灭不会发生在其他任何人身上”这句话的意思。</p>

Such as hath not been in Egypt since the day it was founded even until now. That this signifies that with others there is no such destruction in the natural mind, is evident from the signification of 
the "rain of hail," of which this is said, as being the destruction of truth through falsities (of which just above, n. 7553); and from the signification of the "land of Egypt," as being the natural 
mind (see n. 5276, 5278, 5280, 5288, 5301). That "since the day it was founded even until now" denotes that with others there is no such destruction, is because "day" signifies state, and "foundation" 
its quality, and "Egypt" the natural mind in general. That there is no such destruction with others as there is with those who infest the upright in the other life, is because those who infest had in 
the world been of the church (n. 7317, 7502); being those who had filled the memory that belongs to the natural mind with such things as belong to faith from the Word and from the doctrine of their church, 
and yet had lived contrary to them; and therefore when they are vastated, the things that belong to faith are plucked out, and at the same time very many things that adhere to these, giving rise 
to deep and filthy cavities and furrows. Moreover, the evils of cupidities cannot but be in some measure adjoined, and likewise falsities; and because truths and falsities cannot be together, it is 
evident that if they cannot be separated, they must be cast out to the borders, whence come empty spaces within that have an offensive smell, for all bad smell comes from evils mingled with goods, and 
from falsities mingled with truths. These things do not take place with those who are outside the church, for they have known nothing about the truths of faith from the Word. This is what is signified 
by there being no such destruction with others in the natural mind. </p>

'Of which there has not been the like in Egypt from the day it was founded even until now' means that no such destruction happens to any others in their natural mind. This is clear from the meaning of 
rain in the form of hail, to which these words refer, as the destruction of truth by means of falsities, dealt with immediately above in <a href="7553.htm">7553</a>; from the meaning of 'the land of Egypt' as the natural 
mind, dealt with in <a href="5276.htm">5276</a>, <a href="5278.htm">5278</a>, <a href="5280.htm">5280</a>, <a href="5288.htm">5288</a>, <a href="5301.htm">5301</a>,'from the day it was founded even until now meaning that no such destruction happens to any others, because 'day means state, 'foundation' the nature of 
that state, and 'Egypt' the natural mind in general. The reason why no such destruction happens to any others as happens to those who molest the upright in the next life is that those who so molest 
belonged to the Church when they were in the world, <a href="7317.htm">7317</a>, <a href="7502.htm">7502</a>. They are those who have filled their memory, which is part of their natural mind, with the kinds of things that are matters of faith acquired 
from the Word and from the teachings of their Church, and yet have led a life contrary to those things. Consequently when they undergo vastation, those matters of faith are wrenched out, and very 
much else attached to them, leaving deep, foul pits and craters. Such people's evil desires, as well as their falsities, have inevitably become in some measure linked to those matters of faith. And 
since these cannot exist together with those falsities and evils it is evident that if they cannot be separated they are cast away to the sides, leaving empty spaces within, which emit a foul stench, 
for every foul stench arises out of evils mixed with forms of good, and of falsities mixed with truths. These things do not happen to those outside the Church, for they have no knowledge at all of truths 
of faith acquired from the Word. This is what is meant by the statement that no such destruction happens to any others in their natural mind.

`Quae non sicut illa in Aegypto a die fundata illa et usque ad nunc': quod significet quod talis destructio non apud alios in mente naturali, constat ex significatione `pluviae grandinis,' de qua haec 
dicuntur, quod sit destructio veri per falsa, de qua mox supra n. 7553; ex significatione `terrae Aegypti' quod sit mens naturali, de qua n. 5276, 5278, 5280, 5288, 5301; quod `{1}a die fundata illa 
et usque ad nunc' sit quod apud alios non talis, est quia `dies' significat statum, ac `fundatio' quale ejus, et `Aegyptus' mentem naturalem in genere.  Quod talis destructio non apud alios sit, qualis 
apud illos qui probos infestant in altera vita, est quia illi qui infestant in mundo ab Ecclesia fuerunt, n. 7317, 7502; illi {2}qui memoriam {3}, quae est mentis naturalis, impleverunt talibus quae 
sunt fidei ex Verbo, et ex doctrina Ecclesiae suae, et tamen vixerunt contra illa, quare cum vastantur illi, {4} tunc ea quae sunt fidei eruuntur, et simul perplura illis adhaerentia, inde lacunae 
et scrobes profundae et foedae; mala cupiditatum non possunt (x)quin etiam aliquo modo adjuncta sint, et quoque falsa; illa et haec quia non simul possunt esse, patet, si non separari possunt, quod ad 
terminos ejiciantur, unde vacuitates intus quae graviter olent, omnis enim graveolentia est ex malis mixtis cum bonis, et ex falsis mixtis cum veris; {5}haec non fiunt apud illos qui extra Ecclesiam 
{6}sunt, nam nihil de veris fidei ex Verbo sciverunt.  Hoc significatur per quod talis destructio non apud alio in mente naturali sit. 	@1 in$ 	@2 quia$ 	@3 i suam$ 	@4 A has a long marginal note 
with no indication of where to insert it; it resembles the contents of this paragraph from tunc ea quae sunt fidei to mixtis cum veris, and reads as follows: </p>

perplura illis adhaerentia, inde lacunae et scrobes profundae et foedae, mala enim cupiditatum non possunt quin illis adjuncta sint, et quoque falsa illa et haec quia non simul possunt esse, patet quod 
non separari queant ad terminos ejiciantur, inde lacunae vacuitates intus quae foede olent; graveolentia non aliunde est quam ex bonis mixtis cum malis et veris cum falsis quae sunt fidei ex memoria,
