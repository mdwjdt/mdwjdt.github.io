<h3 align="center" class="ired">属天的奥秘 第4366节</h3>
<h4 align="center"></h4><p><strong>4366.</strong>“以扫说，兄弟啊，我的已经够了，你的仍归你吧”表默示接受，以便祂能以这种方式注入对从真理发展而来的良善的情感。这从拒绝接受所给予的事物清楚可知，因为这种拒绝暗示了愿意收下它，但以扫仍旧接受了。人拒绝，同时又接受所给予的事物，有时目的是为了使情感能被注入。这种情感也通过这种拒绝而增长，因而从思想良善发展到意愿良善。主在属灵生活上引领人所凭借的事物，和人在日常生活中用来引导别人的事物差不多。在日常生活中，拒绝接受通常是为了给予者能出于情感行事；因而不仅仅出于思维，还出于意愿行事。因为如果所给予的未被接纳，所怀的目的就落空了。因此，这个目的会敦促给予者更热切地思想它，从而发自内心意愿它<br />这种事在属灵生活中不如在日常生活中明显，原因在于：良善与真理正在里面结合的人，也就是正在重生的人很少；而且，正在重生的少数人没有反思这种事；也不能反思，事实上，他们并不知道何为属灵良善，因为他们不知道何为仁爱，何为真正意义上的邻舍。他们因不知道这些事，也就无法对属于信仰的真理拥有任何内在概念。此外，他们将属灵生活与日常生活分开了，并且分得那么远，以致他们不敢通过日常生活来推断有关属灵生活的任何观点。他们完全不知道以下事实：这二者是相对应的，并且属灵生活就体现在日常生活中；有些人甚至不允许进行这样的对比。而这个问题的实际情况却是，不通过属于日常生活的事物就无法获得属灵生活的概念。因此，一旦日常生活被夺走，属灵生活就会陷入虚无，直到最终人们不再相信它的存在。这一点从以下事实明显看出来：人们不再相信灵人与天使如世人那样彼此交往，或相互交谈，也像世人那样彼此推理高尚和得体之事，推理公义和公平，良善和真理，只是方式更加完美；他们更不相信灵人和天使能看见、听见、互相探索、联结成各个社群并共同生活，以及许多其它类似的事。</p>

And Esau said, I have much, my brother, be to thee what is to thee. That this signifies tacit acceptance, in order that he might thus instill the affection of the good from truth, may be seen from this 
refusal, in that it involves assent; for he nevertheless accepted. In anyone's refusing and at the same time accepting, the end sometimes is that affection may be instilled; and moreover this is thereby 
increased, and thus passes from thinking well into willing well. In spiritual life man is led by the Lord by things nearly like those by which a man leads others in civil life, in which it is usual 
to refuse to accept, to the end that the giver may act from affection; thus not from thinking only, but also from willing. For if the favor should not be accepted, the end in view would be lost; and 
therefore the end urges the giver to think of it still more intently, and thus to will it from the heart.  [2] The reason why this kind of thing does not appear in spiritual life as in civil life, 
is that there are few in whom good is being conjoined with truths, that is, who are being regenerated; and moreover the few who are being regenerated do not reflect upon such things; nor can they do 
so, for they do not know what spiritual good is, because they do not know what charity is and what in the genuine sense the neighbor is. And as they do not know these things, neither can they have an 
interior idea of the truth that belongs to faith. And moreover they separate spiritual life from civil life so widely, that they would not dare to draw any idea of the one from the other. That the two 
correspond, and that spiritual life is represented in civil life, they know not at all, and some do not even allow any comparison; when yet the case really is that no idea can be had of spiritual life 
except from the things that are in civil life; and therefore if the latter is set aside, the former falls to the ground, until at last it is no longer believed in-as may be plainly evident from the 
fact that it is no longer believed that spirits and angels associate and converse together as men do, and reason in like manner as men do about what is honorable and becoming, just and fair, and good 
and true, and this much more perfectly; still less that they see, hear, and explore one another, join together in societies, dwell together, and many other like things. </p>

'And Esau said, I have much, my brother; let what is yours be yours' means a tacit acceptance, in order that in this way He might instill the affection for good that develops out of truth. This becomes 
clear from this refusal to accept what was offered, in that it really implies a willingness to take it; for Esau went on to accept it. One sometimes refuses an offer when in fact accepting it, to the 
end that affection may be instilled. That affection is also increased by such a refusal and so advances from the thought of what is good to the desire for it. Man is led by the Lord in the spiritual 
life by means of things that are virtually the same as those by which one leads others in everyday life. In everyday life it is quite normal to refuse an offer so that the one who makes it may do so 
with affection, thus not simply because he has thought of making it but also because he desires to do so. Should the offer not be accepted the ultimate intention would perish, and therefore that intention 
incites the one making the offer to think more intently about it and so to make it his heart's desire. </p>

<p><b>[2]</b>
 The reason why this procedure is not apparent in the spiritual life as it is in everyday 
life is that the people with whom good is being joined to truths, that is, who are being regenerated, are few; and what is more, the few who are being regenerated neither reflect on nor are able 
to reflect on such matters as they do not know what spiritual good is because they do not know what charity is and what the neighbour is in the genuine sense. And because they do not know these things 
they cannot have any interior conception about truth which is the truth of faith. In addition to this they set the spiritual life and everyday life so far apart from each other that they do not dare 
to infer from everyday life any notion about the spiritual life. They are totally unaware of the fact that these correspond to each other and that the spiritual life is represented within everyday life; 
indeed some do not even allow any comparison to be made. But the fact of the matter is that no notion of the spiritual life can be had except from the things which belong to everyday life. Once everyday 
life is taken away therefore spiritual life falls to nothing, until at length belief in the existence of it remains no longer. This is made perfectly clear by the fact that people no longer have 
any belief in the idea that spirits and angels mix with one another as men mix, or that they converse with one another, reason with one another just as men reason, though in a far more perfect way, about 
what is honourable and decent, about what is just and fair, and about what is good and true Even less belief exists in the idea that spirits and angels can see, hear, and find out about one another, 
combine into communities and live together, besides many other things. </p>

`Et dixit Esau, Est mihi multum, frater mi, sit tibi quod tibi': quod significet tacitam acceptationem ut sic affectionem boni ex vero insinuaret, constare potest ex renuentia hic quod involvat assensionem, 
nam usque acceptavit; finis renuentiae cum aliquis acceptat, est quandoque ut insinuetur affectio, augetur etiam inde, et sic transit a cogitare bene in velle bene; homo a Domino ducitur 
paene per similia in vita spirituali, per quae homo alios (o)ducit in vita civili; in hac familiare est renuere ob finem ut ex affectione, ita non ex cogitare solum sed etiam ex velle, faciat; si 
enim non acceptaret, finis quem intendit, periret, quare finis urget usque ut intensius cogitet illud, et sic ex corde velit; [2] quod tale non appareat in vita spirituali, sicut in vita civili est 
quia pauci sunt apud quos bonum conjungitur eum veris, hoc est, qui regenerantur, et quoque illi pauci qui regenerantur, non reflectunt super talia, nec reflectere possunt {1}, non enim sciunt quid 
bonum spirituale, quia non quid charitas et quid proximus in genuino sensu; et quia illa {2} non sciunt, nec {3} ideam interiorem dew vero quod fidei, habere possunt; et praeterea spiritualem vitam 
separant a civili in tantum ut ab hac de illa nullam ideam haurire ausint; quod correspondeant et quod illa in hac repraesentetur, prorsus ignorant, immo aliqui ne quidem comparationem admittunt 
{4}; cum tamen res ita se habet quod nulla idea de spirituali vita haberi possit nisi (c)ab illis quae sunt in civili, quapropter hac remota, cadit illa, usque tandem ut non amplius credatur; quod 
constare potest manifeste ex eo quod non magis credatur {5} quod spiritus et angeli inter se conversentur sicut homines, quodque colloquantur, et de honesto et decoro, deque justo et aequo, ac de 
bono et vero, similiter ratiocinentur sicut homines et multo perfectius, minus quod se mutuo videant, audiant, explorent, conjungant in societates, cohabitent, et perplura alia.      @1 pauci qui 
regenerantur, reflectunt super talia, imo qui reflectere possunt$      @2 hoc$      @3 non$      @4 admittant I$      @5 credatur amplius$      @6 ita$ </p>
