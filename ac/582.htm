<h3 align="center" class="ired">属天的奥秘 第582节</h3>
<h4 align="center"></h4><p><strong>582.</strong>“后来神的众子和人的众女交合生子”表示当他们将信的教义事项浸没于自己的恶欲、形成虚假的信念时，就会出现这种情况。这一点从对第2节经文的阐述和说明清楚可知，也就是说，“神的众子”表信的教义事项，而“众女”表恶欲。这种结合所诞生的，必是他们对信的神圣事物的无视和亵渎。因为人的欲望源于我欲和物欲，它们与一切神圣真实之物全然对立。此外，恶欲在人内盛行，所以当人所承认的神圣与真实浸没于这类欲望时，他就完了，因为这些恶欲无法被根除和驱散。他们坚持自己的每一个观念，在来生（即灵界），彼此传达的正是种种观念。因此，一旦出现神圣与真实的观念，不洁与虚假就会附着于它，这不洁与虚假立刻就被觉察出来。因此，不得不将这类人隔离开来，并投入地狱。</p>

<p><strong>[NCE]582.</strong> After the sons of God went in to the daughters of humankind, who bore children to them, means that at the point when they merged the teachings about faith with their corrupt desires they became Nephilim. This meaning can be seen from what was stated and demonstrated just above at verse <a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_582/bible_king-james-version_genesis_6_2" target=_top>2</a> [<a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_582/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_569" target=_top>569-571</a>]: the sons of God symbolize the teachings of faith, and daughters symbolize desire. The child born from this combination is nothing but the practice of viewing the holy attributes of faith as worthless and profaning them.<br />Our cravings, which spring from self-love and materialism, are diametrically opposed to everything holy and true. They have the upper hand in us, so that when we acknowledge something as holy and true and then submerge it in our desires, our doom is sealed, since those desires cannot be uprooted and dissolved. They cling to every idea we have, and ideas are the means of communication people have with each other in the next life. Consequently, as soon as the suggestion of something holy and true comes up, immediately and directly the profanation and falsity attached to it is perceived. Such people, then, simply must be separated and forced down into hell. </p>

After that the sons of God came in unto the daughters of men, and they bare to them. That this signifies that they became Nephilim when they had immersed the doctrinals of faith in their cupidities, 
is evident from what was said and shown above in verse 2, namely, that the "sons of God" signify the doctrinal things of faith, and that "daughters" signify cupidities. The birth thereby produced must 
needs make light of and profane the holy things of faith, for the cupidities of man, being those of the love of self and of the world, are altogether contrary to what is holy and true. Now in man cupidities 
prevail, so that when what is holy and true, and is acknowledged to be such, is immersed in cupidities, it is all over with the man, for the cupidities cannot be rooted out and separated; they 
cling to every idea, and in the other life it is ideas that are communicated from one to another, so that as soon as any idea of what is holy and true is brought forth, what is profane and false is joined 
to it, which is instantly perceived. Therefore such persons have to be separated and thrust down into hell. </p>

<p align="center"><b>Elliott(1983-1999) 582</b></p><p><b>582.</b>
'After the sons of God went in to the daughters of man, who bore children to them' means at that time when they immersed doctrinal matters concerning faith in their own evil desires and became Nephilim. 
This is clear from what has been stated and shown just above at verse 2, that is to say, 'the sons of God' means doctrinal matters concerning faith, while 'daughters' means evil desires. Nothing else 
is born of this union than their treating the holy things of faith as worthless and their profaning them. For a person's desires which stem from self-love and love of the world stand utterly opposed 
to all that is holy and true. Moreover evil desires prevail with man, and therefore when the holy and true which have been acknowledged by him are immersed in such desires he is done for, since these 
cannot be rooted out and dispersed. They cling to every one of his ideas, and in the next life it is ideas that are communicated from one person to another. Consequently as soon as any idea of what 
is holy and true is brought out, so too is the unholiness and falsity attached to it, which is perceived instantly. Consequently such people have to be separated and forced down into hell.  </p>

</p><b>582.</b>
Quod 'postquam intrarunt filii Dei ad filias hominis, et genuerunt eis' significet quod tunc cum immerserint doctrinalia fidei suis cupiditatibus, facti Nephilim, constat ex illis quae mox prius ad 
vers. 2 dicta et ostensa sunt, quod nempe 'filii Dei' significent doctrinalia fidei, et 'filiae' cupiditates; partus inde non alius est quam quod nihili faciant et profanent sancta fidei; nam cupiditates 
hominis, quae sunt amorum sui et mundi, prorsus contrariae sunt omni sancto et vero, et apud hominem cupiditates praevalent; quare cum sanctum et verum, quod agnitum, cupiditatibus immergitur, actum 
est cum homine, nam exstirpari et resolvi non possunt; in unaquavis idea cohaerent, et ideae sunt quae communicantur mutuo in altera vita; quare ut primum aliqua idea sancti ac veri producitur, profanum 
et falsum adjunctum est, quod ilico et momento percipitur; quare tales non possunt non separari et detrudi in infernum. </p>
