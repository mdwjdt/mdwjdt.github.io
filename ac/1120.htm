<h3 align="center" class="ired">属天的奥秘 第1120节</h3>
<h4 align="center"></h4><p>1120．我还得以看到随着时间推移，上古教会成员出自肚脐和胸腔的内呼吸在他们的后代中所经历的变化。它越来越朝后背和腹部退去，因而向外向下后退，直到最后，在洪水前的最后一代中，内呼吸几乎没有存留。当出自胸腔的内呼吸最终荡然无存时，他们遭受到自我的窒息。然而，那时，有些人开始出现外呼吸，以及伴随它的发声，或有声语言。因此，对洪水前的人而言，呼吸与其爱和信的状态一致；当爱和信最终不复存在，只有虚假的信念时，内呼吸就停止了，与天使的直接交流和直觉也随之停止了。</p>

<p><strong>[NCE]1120.</strong> I was also shown that the inner breathing of the people in the earliest church, which had flowed from the navel toward the deeper areas of the chest, had altered as time passed — that is, had altered in their descendants. It had withdrawn more toward the back and the belly, or more toward the surface and downward, until finally in the last generation of that church (the generation right before the Flood), hardly any internal breathing remained. In the end, when the breathing inside the chest disappeared, they spontaneously suffocated.<br />In some people, though, external breathing then took hold, as did articulated sounds, or verbal speech.<br />As I was shown, these are the ways people living before the Flood breathed, depending on the state of their love and faith. In the end, when there was no longer love or faith but only a convinced belief in falsity, internal breathing stopped, as did direct communication with angels and perceptive knowledge. </p>

It has also been shown that the internal respiration of the men of the Most Ancient Church, which was from the navel toward the interior region of the breast, in the course of time, or in their posterity, 
was changed, and receded more toward the back region, and toward the abdomen, thus more outward and downward; and that at length, in the last posterity of that church, which existed immediately 
before the flood, scarcely anything of internal respiration remained; and when at last there remained none of this in the breast, they were suffocated of their own accord; but that in some, external respiration 
then began, and with it articulate sound, or the language of spoken words. Thus with the men before the flood the respiration was in accordance with the state of their love and faith; and at 
last, when there was no love and no faith, but a persuasion of falsity, internal respiration ceased; and with this, the immediate communication with angels, and perception. </p>

I have also been shown that the internal breathing of members of the Most Ancient Church which had come from between the navel and the inner region of the breast was changed in the course of time, that 
is, among their descendants. It retreated more towards the region of the back and towards the abdomen, and so retreated outwards and downwards till at length, among the final descendants of that Church 
who came immediately before the Flood, scarcely any internal breathing was left. And when at length none at all came from the breast they underwent self-caused suffocation. Among certain people of 
that time however external breathing came into existence and with it articulated sound, or vocal speech. Thus the ways in which people breathed prior to the Flood were determined by their state of love 
and faith; and when at length neither love nor faith existed but a persuasion of falsity, internal breathing came to an end. And when that came to an end so did perception and direct communication 
with angels. </p>

Ostensum quoque quod interna respiratio hominum Antiquissimae Ecclesiae quae fuerat ab umbilico versus pectoris interiorem regionem, temporis successu seu in posteris, mutata fuerit, et recesserit magis 
versus regionem tergalem et versus abdomen, ita magis extrorsum et deorsum, et quod tandem in posteritate ultima illius Ecclesiae quae fuit proxime ante diluvium, vix aliquid respirationis internae 
remanserit; et cum tandem nulla facta pectoris, quod a semet suffocati fuerint:  sed quod in aliquibus tunc respiratio externa inceperit, et cum respiratione illa sonus articulatus seu loquela vocum: 
 ita respirationes apud homines ante diluvium se habuerunt secundum statum eorum amoris et fidei; et tandem cum nullus amor et nulla fides, sed persuasio falsi, quod respiratio interna cessaverit et, 
cum illa, communicatio immediata cum angelis et perceptio. </p>
