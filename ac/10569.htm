<h3 align="center" class="ired">属天的奥秘 第10569节</h3>
<h4 align="center"></h4><p><strong>10569</strong>.“要在什么事上得以知道我和你的百姓在你眼中蒙恩呢？岂不是因你与我们同去”表如果神性在他们当中显现，优先于其他人的接纳。这从“得以知道”、“在耶和华眼中蒙恩”和“与我们同去”的含义清楚可知：“得以知道”当论及他们当中的神性时，是指被揭示；“在耶和华眼中蒙恩”是指被接纳（参看<a href="10563.htm">10563</a>节），在此是指优先于其他人被接纳，因为接下来的话说明，如果被接纳，“我和你的百姓将比地面上的所有人民都要尊贵”；“与我们同去”当论及耶和华时，是指进行引领的神性，在此是指领进迦南地的神性（<a href="10567.htm">10567</a>节）。由此明显可知“要在什么事上得以知道我和你的百姓在你眼中蒙恩呢？岂不是因你与我们同去”表示如果神性在他们当中显现，优先于其他人的接纳。<br />当经上说“在耶和华的眼中”时，意思是主的神性在与地上的世人和天上的天使同住的信和爱的真理和良善里面的存在。主之所以存在于信和爱的真理和良善里面，是因为这些来源于主自己；当主存在于与世人或天使同住的这些事物里面时，祂就存在于与他们同住的祂自己的东西里面，而不是存在于他们自己的东西，或他们的自我里面，因为这是邪恶。也正因如此，在圣言中，“眼睛”当论及接受主的神性事物的世人时，表示信，以及一种乐于接受的理解力；因为理解力是内在的眼睛；信是被看见并感知到的真理。在圣言中，当论及世人时，“眼睛”表示信，以及理解力（参看<a href="2701.htm">2701</a>，<a href="4403.htm">4403</a>-<a href="4421.htm">4421</a>，<a href="4523.htm">4523</a>-<a href="4534.htm">4534</a>，<a href="9051.htm">9051</a>节）。<br />还必须说明这种视觉的起源。存在一种真实的光，它能光照理解力，完全不同于能使肉眼看见的光，并与这光分离。光照理解力的光来自天堂，而能使肉眼看见的光存在于世上。天堂之光是从在天堂显为太阳的主那里流出的，本质上是从主的神性良善发出的神性真理。由此明显可知，为何“眼睛”当论及耶和华时，表示主的神性存在；当论及接受主的神性真理或祂的光的世人时，表示信和一种被光照的理解力。<br />世人并不知道存在一种真实的光，它能光照人类心智并形成理解力，尽管人们将视觉和光归因于理解力，尽管在圣言中，主多次被称为光，以此表示祂通过信和信之光被看见。光照人类心智的，就是这种真实的光，从显为太阳的主那里发出的神性真理就是这光，并在它被接受的地方赋予对真理的聪明理解（参看<a href="9548.htm">9548</a>，<a href="9684.htm">9684</a>节提到的地方，以及<a href="9570.htm">9570</a>，<a href="9571.htm">9571</a>e，<a href="9594.htm">9594</a>节的说明）。<br />由此可见在圣言中，“耶和华的眼目”表示什么，如以赛亚书：<br />耶和华啊，求你侧耳而听！耶和华啊，求你睁眼而看！（以赛亚书<a href="http://39-27.cn/赛37.17.htm">37:17</a>）<br />耶利米书：<br />我必注目好待他们，领他们返回自己的地，建立他们。（耶利米书<a href="http://39-27.cn/耶24.6.htm">24:6</a>）<br />诗篇：<br />看哪，耶和华的眼目在敬畏祂的人身上。（诗篇<a href="http://39-27.cn/诗33.18.htm">33:18</a>）<br /><br />耶和华在祂的圣殿里，耶和华的宝座在天上，祂的眼睑察验世人。（诗篇<a href="http://39-27.cn/诗11.4.htm">11:4</a>）<br />以及别处。</p>

<p align="center"><b>Potts(1905-1910) 10569</b></p><p><b>10569.</b>
And wherein shall it even become known that I have found grace in Thine eyes, I and Thy people? is it not in Thy going with us? That this signifies reception above others if the Divine be manifested 
among them, is evident from the signification of "becoming known," when said of the Divine among them, as being to be revealed; from the signification of "finding grace in the eyes of Jehovah," as being 
to be received (see above, n. 10563), here, above others, because there follows, "and we shall be rendered preeminent, I and Thy people, above all the people that are upon the faces of the ground;" 
and from the signification of "going with us," when said of Jehovah, as being the Divine leading, here into the land of Canaan (n. 10567). From this it is evident that by "wherein shall it ever become 
known that I have found grace in Thine eyes, I and Thy people? is it not in Thy going with us?" is signified reception above others if the Divine be manifested among them.  [2] It is said "in the eyes 
of Jehovah," and thereby is signified the Divine presence of the Lord in the truths and goods of faith and of love with men on earth and with angels in the heavens. The reason why the presence of 
the Lord is in the truths and goods of faith and of love, is that these are from the Lord Himself; and when the Lord is present in these with men and with angels, He is then present in His own with them, 
and not in what is their own, for this is evil. From this also it is that by "eyes" in the Word, when said of men who receive the Divine things of the Lord, is signified faith and also a recipient 
understanding; for the understanding is the internal eye; and faith is truth which is seen and perceived. (That the "eyes," when said in the Word of men, signify faith and also understanding, see n. 
2701, 4403-4421, 4523-4534, 9051.) [3] It shall also be told whence comes this sight. There is a real light which illumines the understanding, and which is quite distinct from the light which illumines 
the sight of the body. The light which illumines the understanding is from heaven; but that which illumines the sight of the body is in the world. The light of heaven is from the Lord as a sun there, 
and is in its essence the Divine truth that proceeds from the Lord's Divine good. From this it is evident whence it is that by the "eyes," when said of Jehovah, is signified the Divine presence of 
the Lord; and by the "eyes," when said of men who receive the Divine truth of the Lord, or His light, is signified faith and an enlightened understanding. [4] That it is a real light which illumines 
minds, and effects understanding with men, is not known in the world, although men attribute sight and light to the understanding, and although in the Word the Lord is often called "the Light," by which 
is meant that He is seen by faith and the light thereof. (That it is a real light which illumines minds, and that the Divine truth which proceeds from the Lord as a sun is this light, and that where 
it is received it gives the understanding of truth, may be seen in the places cited in n. 9548, 9684; also in n. 9570, 9571, 9594.) [5] From all this it can be seen what is signified in the Word by 
"the eyes of Jehovah," as in these passages: </p>
<p>     Incline Thine ear, O Jehovah, and hear; open Thine eyes, O Jehovah, and see (Isa. 37:17).      I will set Mine eye upon them for good, and I will bring 
them back upon their own land, and I will build them (Jer. 24:6).      Behold the eye of Jehovah is upon them that fear Him (Ps. 33:18).      Jehovah is in the temple of His holiness, the throne 
of Jehovah is in heaven; His eyes behold, His eyelids try, the sons of man (Ps. 11:4); and elsewhere. </p>

<p align="center"><b>Elliott(1983-1999) 10569</b></p><p><b>10569.</b>
'And how will it ever be made known that I have found grace in Your eyes, I and Your people? Will it not be in Your going with us?' means acceptance in preference to others if the Divine shows Himself 
among them. This is clear from the meaning of 'being made known', when it has reference to the Divine among them, as being revealed; from the meaning of 'finding grace in Jehovah's eyes' as being accepted, 
dealt with above in <a href="10563.htm">10563</a>, in this instance being accepted in preference to others since the words that follow state that if accepted 'I and Your people will be made more distinguished than all 
the people who are on the face of the ground'; and from the meaning of 'going with us', when it has reference to Jehovah, as the Divine acting as leader, at this point into the land of Canaan, dealt 
with above in <a href="10567.htm">10567</a>. From all this it is evident that 'how will it ever be made known that I have found grace in Your eyes, I and Your people? Will it not be in Your going with us?' means acceptance 
in preference to others if the Divine shows Himself among them.  </p>
<p></p>
<p><b>[2]</b>
 When the words 'in Jehovah's eyes' are used the meaning is the Lord's Divine presence within the truths and forms of the good of 
faith and love residing with people on earth and with angels in heaven. The reason why the Lord is present within truths and forms of the good of faith and love is that these originate in the Lord Himself, 
and when the Lord is present within these things as they reside with people on earth or with angels, He is present in what is His residing with them and not in what is their own or their proprium, 
since this is evil. So it is also that in the Word, in places where people who are receptive of the things which are Divine and the Lord's are the subject, faith and also a receptive understanding 
is meant by 'the eyes'; for the understanding is the eye within, and faith is the truth that is seen and perceived by it. Regarding 'the eyes', that when people are the subject in the Word, faith and 
also the understanding are meant by them, see <a href="2701.htm">2701</a>, <a href="4403.htm">4403</a>-<a href="4421.htm">4421</a>, <a href="4523.htm">4523</a>-<a href="4534.htm">4534</a>, <a href="9051.htm">9051</a>.  </p>
<p></p>
<p><b>[3]</b>
 The origin of this sight must also be stated. A real light exists that enlightens the understanding, altogether 
distinct and separate from the light which enables the eyes of the body to see. The light which enlightens the understanding comes from heaven, whereas that which enables the eyes of the body to see 
exists in the world. The light of heaven flows from the Lord as the Sun there and is essentially Divine Truth emanating from the Lord's Divine Good. From this it is evident why it is that by 'the eyes', 
when they are attributed to Jehovah, the Lord's Divine presence is meant, and that by 'the eyes', when they are attributed to people receptive of the Lord's Divine Truth or His light, faith and an 
enlightened understanding are meant.  </p>
<p></p>
<p><b>[4]</b>
 The existence of the real light that enlightens human minds and forms the understanding is not known in the world, even though people attribute vision and 
light to the understanding, and even though very many times in the Word the Lord is called the Light, which is taken to mean that He is seen by means of faith and the light of faith. The fact that the 
real light is what enlightens human minds, and that Divine Truth emanating from the Lord as the Sun is that Light, imparting an intelligent understanding of truth where it is received, see in the places 
referred to in <a href="9548.htm">9548</a>, <a href="9684.htm">9684</a>, and also what is said in <a href="9570.htm">9570</a>, <a href="9571.htm">9571</a>(end), <a href="9594.htm">9594</a>.  </p>
<p></p>
<p><b>[5]</b>
 From all this it becomes clear what is meant in the Word by 'Jehovah's eyes', as in Isaiah,  </p>
<blockquote>
Incline Your ear, 
O Jehovah, and hear; and open Your eyes, O Jehovah, and see. <a href="http://bible.gospelcom.net/cgi-bin/bible?passage=Isa%2037:17&amp;version=ESV&amp;interface=print&amp;showfn=yes&amp;showxref">Isa 37:17</a>.  
</blockquote>
<p>In Jeremiah,  </p>
<blockquote>
I will set My eye on them for good, and I will bring them back onto their land and build them. <a href="http://bible.gospelcom.net/cgi-bin/bible?passage=Jer%2024:6&amp;version=ESV&amp;interface=print&amp;showfn=yes&amp;showxref">Jer 24:6</a>. 
</blockquote>
<p>In David,  </p>
<blockquote>
Behold, the eye of Jehovah is on those who fear Him. <a href="http://bible.gospelcom.net/cgi-bin/bible?passage=Ps%2033:18&amp;version=ESV&amp;interface=print&amp;showfn=yes&amp;showxref">Ps 33:18</a>.  
</blockquote>
<p>And in the same author,  </p>
<blockquote>
Jehovah is in His holy temple, Jehovah's throne is in heaven; His eyes see, and His eyelids 
test the sons of man. <a href="http://bible.gospelcom.net/cgi-bin/bible?passage=Ps%2011:4&amp;version=ESV&amp;interface=print&amp;showfn=yes&amp;showxref">Ps 11:4</a>.  
</blockquote>

`Et in quo notum fiet usquam quod invenerim gratiam in oculis Tuis, ego et populus Tuus, nonne in eundo Te cum nobis?'  quod significet receptionem prae aliis si Divinum manifestetur apud illos, constat 
ex significatione `notum fieri' cum de Divino apud illos, quod sit revelari; ex significatione `gratiam invenire in oculis Jehovae' quod sit {1}receptus esse, de qua supra n. 10563, hic {2} prae 
aliis, (m)quoniam sequitur, `sic praestantiores reddemur ego et populus Tuus prae omni populo qui super faciebus humi';(n) et ex significatione `ire cum nobis' cum de Jehovah, quod sit Divinum ducens 
hic in terram Canaanem, de qua supra n. 10567; inde patet quod per `in quo notum fiet usquam quod invenerim gratiam in oculis Tuis, ego et populus Tuus, nonne in eundo Te cum nobis?' significetur receptio 
prae aliis si Divinum manifestetur apud illos. 	[2] Dicitur `in oculis Jehovae,' et per id significatur praesentia Divina Domini in veris et bonis fidei et amoris apud homines in terris (c)et apud 
angelos in caelis; quod praesentia Domini sit in veris et bonis fidei et amoris, est quia {3}haec ab Ipso Domino sunt, et cum Dominus apud homines et apud angelos praesens est in illis, tunc praesens 
est in Suo apud illos (c)et non in proprio illorum, hoc enim (t)est malum'; inde quoque est quod per `oculos' in Verbo, ubi de hominibus qui recipiunt Divina Domini, significetur fides et quoque intellectus 
recipiens, nam intellectus {4}est oculus internus, ac fides est verum quod videtur et percipitur; quod oculi {5}cum de hominibus, in Verbo significent fidem, et quoque intellectum, videatur 
n. 2701, 4403-4421, 4523-4534, 9051. 	[3] Unde ille visus, etiam dicetur:  est realis lux quae illuminat intellectum, prorsus (x)distincta a luce quae illuminat {6}visum corporis; lux illa quae illuminat 
{7}intellectum est e caelo, quae autem {6}visum corporis est in mundo; lux caeli est a Domino ut Sole ibi, et est in sua essentia Divinum Verum procedens a Divino Bono Domini; inde patet unde est 
quod per `oculos' cum de Jehovah, significetur praesentia Divina Domini, (c)et quod per `oculos' cum de {8} hominibus qui recipiunt Divinum Verum Domini, seu lucem {9}Ipsius, significetur fides et intellectus 
illustratus. 	[4] Quod realis lux sit quae illuminat mentes et facit intellectum apud homines, non notum est in mundo, tametsi ab hominibus intellectui tribuitur visus et lux et tametsi Dominus 
in Verbo pluries' dicitur Lux, (c)ac intelligitur quod videatur per fidem et ejus lucem.  Quod {10} realis lux sit quae illuminat mentes, et quod {11} Divinum Verum procedens a Domino ut Sole sit 
illa Lux, {12}et quod det intellectum veri ubi recipitur, in locis citatis n. 9548, 9684, tum n. 9570, 9571 fin., (x)9594. 	[5] Ex his constare potest quid per `oculos Jehovae' in Verbo significatur,
