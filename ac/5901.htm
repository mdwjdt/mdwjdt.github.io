<h3 align="center" class="ired">属天的奥秘 第5901节</h3>
<h4 align="center"></h4><p><strong>5901.</strong>“乃是神”表是神性如此行。这是显而易见的，无需解释。此中情形如何，在论述约瑟被卖到埃及的地方已经解释了；在埃及，约瑟先是在波提乏家服事。这个解释表明，由于约瑟在至高意义上代表主，在较低意义上代表那些正在被主重生的人，所以首先要获得的是记忆知识。因为记忆知识是源头，真理必须从它们当中被推导出来，然后终止于其中。此后便朝着更内在的事物，或说具有更内在性质的观念发展。这些就是约瑟所代表的事；这就是为什么说是神性差他到这个国家来。</p>

But God. That this signifies that the Divine had done this, is evident without explication. How the case herein is, has been unfolded wherein it is said of Joseph that he was sold into Egypt and there 
first ministered in the house of Potiphar; namely, that as in the supreme sense he represented the Lord and in a lower sense those who are being regenerated by the Lord, memory-knowledges are the first 
things which are to be learned; for they are the things from which truths are to be concluded, and in which truths are then to be terminated. Afterward progress is made toward more interior things. 
All this is what Joseph represented, and this being so, it was the Divine which sent him there. </p>

'but God' means that the Divine had done so. This is clear without explanation. What is involved in all this has been explained at the point where Joseph's being sold into Egypt is dealt with, in which 
country he first served in Potiphar's house. That explanation shows that because in a supreme sense Joseph represented the Lord and in a lower sense those who are being regenerated by the Lord, factual 
knowledge is what has to be acquired first. For that knowledge is the source from which truths have to be deduced and within which those truths have then to be encapsulated. After that, progress 
can be made to ideas of a more internal nature. These are the things that Joseph' represented, which was why it was the Divine who sent him to that country. </p>

`Sed Deus': quod significet quod Divinum hoc egerit, constat absque explicatione. Quomodo cum his se habet, explicatum est ubi de Josepho quod venditus in Aegyptum, et (t)ibi primum ministraverit in 
domo Potiphari: quod nempe quia in supremo sensu repraesentabat Dominum, et in sensu inferiore illos qui a Domino regenerantur, scientifica sint prima quae discenda; sunt enim illa ex quibus vera concludenda 
sunt et in quibus dein vera terminanda; postmodum versus interiora magis fit progressus; haec sunt quae `Josephus' repraesentabat; et quia ita, Divinum fuit quod {1}misit illum illuc. @1 illum 
in Aegyptum misit$ </p>
