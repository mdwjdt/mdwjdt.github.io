<h3 align="center" class="ired">属天的奥秘 第6867节</h3>
<h4 align="center"></h4><p><strong>6867.</strong>“我是谁，竟能到法老那里”表他尚未处于这样一种状态：他觉得自己能面对并除去侵扰的虚假。这从“我是谁”和“到法老那里”的含义清楚可知：“我是谁”是指他尚未达到这种状态；“到法老那里”是指面对侵扰的虚假，因为“法老”表示侵扰的虚假（参看<a href="6651.htm">6651</a>，<a href="6679.htm">6679</a>，<a href="6683.htm">6683</a>节）。它也表示除去它们，因为从主的人身发出的神圣（如前所述，<a href="6864.htm">6864</a>节）除去虚假和邪恶；事实上，这些虚假和邪恶根本无法承受祂的同在。由于摩西的这些话是在谦卑的状态下说的，所以才说他觉得自己做不到。</p>

Who am I that I should go unto Pharaoh? That this signifies not being yet in such a state as to seem to himself to be able to go and remove the infesting falsities, is evident from the signification 
of "Who am I?" as being that he was not yet in such a state; and from the signification of "going to Pharaoh," as being to go to the infesting falsities, for by "Pharaoh" is signified falsity which infests 
(see n. 6651, 6679, 6683). That it also denotes to remove, is because the holy proceeding from the Lord's Human (of which above, n. 6864) removes falsities and evils, because these are quite unable 
to endure its presence. As these things were said from humiliation, it is said that he did not yet seem to himself able to do this. </p>

<p align="center"><b>Elliott(1983-1999) 6867</b></p><p><b>6867.</b>
'Who am I that I should go to Pharaoh?' means that he had not yet arrived at the kind of state in which it seemed to him that he was able to face molesting falsities and remove them from himself. This 
is clear from the meaning of 'who am I?' as not yet having arrived at the kind of state; and from the meaning of 'going to Pharaoh' as facing molesting falsities, for 'Pharaoh' means falsity that molests, <a href="6651.htm">6651</a>, <a href="6679.htm">6679</a>, <a href="6687.htm">6687</a>. The removing of them is also meant because the Holy influence going forth from the Lord's Human, dealt with above in <a href="6864.htm">6864</a>, removes falsities and evils; for falsities and evils 
cannot at all withstand His presence. Since it was a state of humility in which Moses' words were spoken, it is said that it seemed to him that he was not able to do it. </p>

<p align="center"><b>Latin(1748-1756) 6867</b>
</p><b>6867.</b>
`Quis ego quod eam ad Pharaonem?': quod significet quod nondum in tali statu ut falsa infestantia adire et removere sibi posse videretur, constat ex significatione `quis ego' quod sit quod nondum in 
tali statu; ex significatione `ire ad Pharaonem' quod sit adire falsa infestantia, per `Pharaonem' enim significatur falsum quod infestat, n. 6651, 6679, 6683; quod etiam sit removere, est quia Sanctum 
procedens ab Humano Domini, de qua supra n. 6864, removet falsa et mala, nam haec praesentiam {1}Illius prorsus non sustinent.  Quia ex humiliatione haec dicta sunt, dicitur quod id sibi non posse 
videretur. 	@1 Sancti procedentis a Domino$ </p>
