<h3 align="center" class="ired">属天的奥秘 第141节</h3>
<h4 align="center"></h4><p><strong>141.</strong>关于人的自我，对于属世属肉体之人、属灵之人、属天之人而言，有很多可说的。对于属世属肉体之人，自我是他的全部，在此之外，他一无所知。故如前面所说，他以为自我若失去了，他也将一并丧失。对于属灵之人，自我也看似他的全部，尽管他知道主是万有的生命之源，是主赋予智慧聪明及思想行动的能力。可是这种知识只是口头上的，不是心里的。属天之人却真正明了主是万有的生命之源，是主赋予智慧聪明及思想行动的能力，因为他能觉知这一事实。他不渴望自我，但是主赐予他们自我，同时使他们能尽知良善与真理，享受一切快乐。天使的自我即是如此，同时享受着最大的平安和宁静，因为充满他们自我的是主的神性。主引导他们的自我，或说，主通过这种自我引导他们。这种自我是天堂，属肉体之人的自我却是地狱。关于自我，更多可见下文。</p>

<p><strong>[NCE]141.</strong> An endless number of things can be said about self-rule{*1} in the individual, specifically about its nature in a body-oriented or worldly person, in a spiritual person, and in a heavenly person.<br />In carnal, materialistic people, their sense of autonomy is the all-in-all. They know nothing else. If it died, they would think they had died, as noted earlier [<a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_141/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_123" target=_top>123</a>].<br />Autonomy looks the same in spiritual people. Although they know and admit that the Lord is the life in all things, that he is the giver of wisdom and understanding and so of thought and action, they do not really believe it.<br />Heavenly people, however, acknowledge that the Lord is the life of all and the giver of thought and action because they perceive that it is so, and they have no desire at all for autonomy. Yet even though they do not seek autonomy, the Lord gives it to them. This autonomy or selfhood is directly bound up with their ability to perceive what is good and true and with their happiness.<br />Such is the autonomy or selfhood present in angels, and its presence brings them the highest peace and tranquillity. Their selfhood is composed of qualities that belong to the Lord, who governs their self-governance, or rather governs them through their self-governance. This selfhood is the epitome of heavenliness; the selfhood of a body-centered person, on the other hand, is hellish. More about autonomy or selfhood will follow, however.<br /> <br /><strong>Footnotes:</strong><br />{*1} In this passage the words "self-rule," "self-governance," "autonomy," "sense of autonomy," "autonomy or selfhood," and "selfhood" are used to translate the Latin proprium, literally meaning that which is proper to oneself. The term has an equivocal meaning in Swedenborg, as this passage suggests. Sometimes it simply means "self" in a neutral sense; sometimes it is equated with the evils arising from desire and selfishness (see, for example, Swedenborg's 1763 work <a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_141/swedenborg_doctrine-of-the-lord-rogers_17" target=_top>The Lord 17</a>); and at other times, as at the end of this passage, it is said to be a source of heavenly peace and happiness. In essence Swedenborg holds that, as all good comes from the Lord, all evil comes from self-will. Consequently, regeneration radically changes one's sense of self. The idea goes back to Christ himself: "Those who find their soul shall lose it, and those who lose their soul for my sake shall find it" (<a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_141/bible_king-james-version_matthew_10_39" target=_top>Matthew 10:39</a>). Similarly in <a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_141/bible_king-james-version_galatians_2_20" target=_top>Galatians 2:20</a>: "I am crucified with Christ. Nevertheless I do live; yet not I, but Christ lives in me." [RS] </p>

Innumerable things might be said about man's Own in describing its nature with the corporeal and worldly man, with the spiritual man, and with the celestial man. With the corporeal and worldly man, his 
Own is his all, he knows of nothing else than his Own, and imagines, as before said, that if he were to lose this Own he would perish. With the spiritual man also his Own has a similar appearance, 
for although he knows that the Lord is the life of all, and gives wisdom and understanding, and consequently the power to think and to act, yet this knowledge is rather the profession of his lips than 
the belief of his heart. But the celestial man discerns that the Lord is the life of all and gives the power to think and to act, for he perceives that it is really so. He never desires his Own, nevertheless 
an Own is given him by the Lord, which is conjoined with all perception of what is good and true, and with all happiness. The angels are in such an Own, and are at the same time in the highest 
peace and tranquility, for in their Own are those things which are the Lord's, who governs their Own, or them by means of their Own. This Own is the veriest celestial itself, whereas that of the corporeal 
man is infernal. But concerning this Own more hereafter. </p>

Countless things can be said about the proprium - about what the proprium is like in the case of the bodily-minded and worldly man, what it is like in the case of the spiritual man, and what in the case 
of the celestial man. With the bodily-minded and worldly man the proprium is his all. He is unaware of anything else but the proprium. And, as has been stated, if he were to lose his proprium he would 
think that he was dying. With the spiritual man the proprium takes on a similar appearance, for although he knows that the Lord is the life of all, and that He confers wisdom and intelligence, and 
consequently the ability to think and to act, it is more a matter of something he says and not so much something he believes. The celestial man however acknowledges that the Lord is the life of all, 
who confers the ability to think and act, because he perceives that this is so. Nor does he ever desire the proprium. Nevertheless even though he does not desire it the Lord grants him a proprium which 
is joined to him with a complete perception of what is good and true, and with complete happiness. Angels possess a proprium such as this, and at the same time utmost peace and tranquillity, for their 
proprium has within it things that are the Lord's, who is governing their proprium, that is, governing them by means of their proprium. This proprium is utterly heavenly, whereas the proprium of the 
bodily-minded man is hellish. But more about the proprium further on.  </p>

</p><b>141.</b>
De proprio innumerabilia sunt quae dici possunt; nempe quomodo se habet proprium apud hominem corporeum et mundanum, quomodo apud hominem spiritualem, et quomodo apud caelestem. Proprium apud hominem 
corporeum et mundanum est omne ejus; non scit aliud quam proprium; si proprium perderet, ut dictum, putaret se perire. Apud hominem spiritualem etiam proprium apparet simile, nam is, tametsi novit quod 
Dominus sit vita omnium et det sapientiam et intelligentiam, proinde det cogitare et agere, usque hoc dicit, sed non ita credit. Homo autem caelestis agnoscit quod Dominus sit vita omnium, det cogitare 
et agere, nam percipit quod ita sit, nec usquam cupit proprium; et tametsi non cupit proprium, usque datur ei a Domino proprium, quod conjunctum est cum omni perceptione boni et veri, et cum omni 
felicitate; angeli in tali proprio sunt, et tunc in summa pace et tranquillitate; nam in proprio illorum sunt illa quae sunt Domini, Qui regit illorum proprium, seu illos per proprium illorum: hoc proprium 
est ipsissimum caeleste; at proprium hominis corporei est infernale: sed de proprio plura in sequentibus.
