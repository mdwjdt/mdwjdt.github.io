<h3 align="center" class="ired">属天的奥秘 第7861节</h3>
<h4 align="center"></h4><p><strong>7861.</strong>“若留到早晨，要用火烧了”表达到目的的状态通过试探而来。这从“留到早晨”和“用火烧了”清楚可知：“留到早晨”是指达到最终状态的状态，最终状态就是升入天堂的状态，因为“早晨”表示升入天堂和那里的启示（参看<a href="7860.htm">7860</a>节），因此，早晨之前的时间表示达到这种状态的状态，在这种状态下，他们可以享受剩下的，或吃了，但以后不可以；“用火烧了”是指经历试探。“用火烧了”之所以表示试探，是因为火用来进行洁净，还因为当人进入试探时，他会面对他的恶欲，这就是“火”。</p>

<p align="center"><b>Potts(1905-1910) 7861</b></p><p><b>7861.</b>
And that which is left of it until the morning ye shall burn with fire. That this signifies a state intermediate to the end through temptations, is evident from the signification of "that which is left 
until the morning," as being a state intermediate to the last, which is the state of elevation into heaven, for by "morning" is signified elevation into heaven and enlightenment there (see just above, 
n. 7860), and therefore by the time before morning is signified an intermediate state, in which it was allowed to enjoy that which was left, or to eat it, but not afterward; and from the signification 
of "burning with fire" as being to undergo temptations. That temptations are signified by "burning with fire" is because purifications are effected by fire; also because when man is in temptations, 
he is let down into his cupidities, which are fires. </p>

<p align="center"><b>Elliott(1983-1999) 7861</b></p><p><b>7861.</b>
'And what does remain of it until the morning you shall burn with fire' means the state leading up to the end arrived at through temptations. This is clear from the meaning of 'what remains till morning' 
as the state leading up to the last, the last being when they are raised to heaven (for 'the morning' means being raised to heaven and enlightenment there, see immediately above in <a href="7860.htm">7860</a>, and therefore 
the time before morning means the state leading up to this, during but not after which they were allowed to enjoy or eat what was left); and from the meaning of 'burning with fire' as undergoing 
temptations. Temptations are meant by 'burning with fire' because fire can be used to purify, and also because when a person enters temptations he is confronted with his evil desires, which are 'fires'. </p>

<p align="center"><b>Latin(1748-1756) 7861</b>
</p><b>7861.</b>
`Et residuum de illo usque ad mane igne comburetis': quod significet statum medium ad finem per tentationes, constat ex significatione `residui {1} ad mane quod sit status medius ad ultimum, qui est 
elevationis in caelum, per `mane' enim significatur elevatio in caelum, et illustratio ibi, videatur mox supra n. 7860, ideo per `tempus ante mane' significatur status medius; in hoc statu (t)frui licuit 
residuo seu comedere illud, non autem postea; et ex significatione `igne comburere' quod sit subire tentationes; quod tentationes per `igne comburere' significentur, est quia {2}purificationes fiunt 
per ignem; tum quia cum homo in tentationes, in cupiditates suas immissus est, quae sunt ignes. 	@1 i hic$ 	@2 per ignem sordes non modo purificantur, sed etiam delentur, sicut homo a malis et falsis 
quae sunt sordes spirituales, per tentationes; inde est quod in Verbo tentationes etiam per ignem describantur$ </p>
