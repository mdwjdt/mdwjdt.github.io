Verse 12. And a son of eight days shall be circumcised unto you, every male in your generations, he that is born in the house, and he that is bought with silver from every son that is a stranger who 
is not of thy seed. "A son of eight days," signifies any beginning of purification whatever; "shall be circumcised unto you," signifies the purification; "every male," signifies those who are in the truth 
of faith "in your generations," signifies the things which are of faith; "he that is born in the house," signifies those who are celestial; "he that is bought with silver," signifies those who are 
spiritual, who are within the church; "from every son that is a stranger who is not of thy seed," signifies those who are outside the church. </p>

<p align="center"><b>Elliott(1983-1999) 2043</b></p><p><b>2043.</b>
Verse 12 And a son eight days old shall be circumcised among you, every male throughout your generations, he who is born in the house, and he who is the purchase of silver, from every son who is a foreigner 
and not of your seed. </p>
<p>'A son eight days old' means any beginning whatever to purification. 'Shall be circumcised among you' means purification. 'Every male' means those who possess the truth 
of faith. 'Throughout your generations' means the things that comprise faith. 'He who is born in the house' means celestial people, 'he who is the purchase of silver' spiritual people who are inside 
the Church. 'From every son who is a foreigner and not of your seed' means those outside the Church. </p>

Vers. 12.  Et filius octo dierum, circumcidetur vobis, omnis masculus, in generationes vestras, natus domus, et emptio argenti, ab omni filio alienigena, qui non e semine tuo ille. `Filius octo dierum' 
significat principium purificationis quodcumque: `circumcidetur vobis' significat purificationem: `omnis masculus' significat eos qui in vero fidei: `in generationes vestras' significat illa quae 
sunt fidei: `natus domus' significat caelestes: `emptio argenti' significat spirituales qui sunt intra Ecclesiam: `ab omni filio alienigena, qui non e semine tuo ille' significat illos qui extra Ecclesiam. </p>
