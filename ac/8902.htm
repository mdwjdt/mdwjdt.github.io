<h3 align="center" class="ired">属天的奥秘 第8902节</h3>
<h4 align="center"></h4><p><strong>8902.</strong>不可杀人表不可夺走任何人的属灵生命，以及不可毁灭信与仁，不可仇恨邻舍。这从“杀人”的含义清楚可知，“杀人”是指剥夺属灵生命。“杀人”之所以在内义上具有这种含义，是因为内义论述与人同在的属灵生命或天堂生命；与人同在的属灵生命，或天堂生命是信与仁的生命；故“不可杀人”还表示不可毁灭任何人里面的信与仁。“不可杀人”之所以在内义上也表示不可仇恨邻舍，是因为仇恨邻舍的人总想着要杀他，而且若不是因为害怕惩罚、丧失生命或名声等等，就会实际行出来。因为仇恨源于邪恶，与仁爱相反，并且一心只想杀害被恨的人：在世上想杀害他的身体，在来世则想杀害他的灵魂。这一切就是主在马太福音中所说这些话的意思：<br />你们听见有吩咐古人的话，说，不可杀人；凡杀人的，难免受审判。只是我告诉你们：凡无缘无故向弟兄动怒的，难免受审判。凡骂弟兄是拉加（饭桶）的，难免公会的审断；凡骂弟兄是魔利（白痴）的，难免地狱的火。（马太福音<a href="http://39-27.cn/太5.21.htm">5:21</a>，<a href="http://39-27.cn/太5.22.htm">22</a>）<br />“无缘无故向弟兄动怒”表示对邻舍的仇恨，说他“拉加（饭桶）”，叫他“魔利（白痴）”描述了更大程度的仇恨，这种愤怒是对仁爱的远离，来源于邪恶，因而是仇恨（参看<a href="357.htm">357</a>，<a href="4164.htm">4164</a>，<a href="5034.htm">5034</a>，<a href="5798.htm">5798</a>，<a href="5887.htm">5887</a>，<a href="5888.htm">5888</a>节）。<br />“杀人”在内义上表示夺走任何人的属灵生命，因而是指毁灭信与仁，这一点从圣言中提到“杀人”或“杀”的经文明显看出来，如以赛亚书：<br />看哪！耶和华残忍的日子临到，满了忿恨、烈怒、怒气，使这地荒凉，从其中除灭罪人。那时，天上的众星群宿都不发光，日头一出，就变黑暗；月亮也不放光。我必因邪恶刑罚世界，因罪孽刑罚恶人。我必使人比精金还少，使人子比俄斐的金更稀罕！凡被发现的，必被刺死；凡被召聚的，必倒在剑下。他们的婴孩，必在他们眼前摔碎；他们的房屋，必被抢夺；他们的妻子，必被玷污。他们的弓必击碎少年人，他们的眼也不顾惜儿子。（以赛亚书<a href="http://39-27.cn/赛13.9.htm">13:9</a>-<a href="http://39-27.cn/赛13.12.htm">12</a>，<a href="http://39-27.cn/赛13.15.htm">15</a>，<a href="http://39-27.cn/赛13.16.htm">16</a>，<a href="http://39-27.cn/赛13.18.htm">18</a>）<br />这段经文所论述的主题是教会的末期，这时信与仁不复存在；这段时期就是“耶和华残忍的日子，满了忿恨、烈怒、怒气”。谁都能看出，此处所指的是其它事，而不是字面上的这些话所描述的事；然而，若不凭这些话在灵义上所具有的含义，就无从知道表示什么。就灵义而言，“地”是指教会（<a href="566.htm">566</a>，<a href="662.htm">662</a>，<a href="1067.htm">1067</a>，<a href="1262.htm">1262</a>，<a href="1413.htm">1413</a>，<a href="1607.htm">1607</a>，<a href="1733.htm">1733</a>，<a href="1850.htm">1850</a>，<a href="2117.htm">2117</a>，<a href="2118.htm">2118</a>e，<a href="2928.htm">2928</a>，<a href="3355.htm">3355</a>，<a href="4447.htm">4447</a>，<a href="4535.htm">4535</a>，<a href="5577.htm">5577</a>，<a href="8011.htm">8011</a>，<a href="8732.htm">8732</a>节）；因此，“使这地荒凉，从其中除灭罪人”表示那时教会成员缺乏信与仁。<br />“众星群宿”是指关于真理和良善的知识或认知（参看<a href="2120.htm">2120</a>，<a href="2495.htm">2495</a>，<a href="2849.htm">2849</a>，<a href="4697.htm">4697</a>节）。当这些知识或认知不再被经由仁之信所流入的天堂之光光照时，经上就是它们“不放光”。“日头”是指对主之爱，“月亮”是指对主之信（参看<a href="2120.htm">2120</a>，<a href="2441.htm">2441</a>，<a href="2494.htm">2494</a>，<a href="3636.htm">3636</a>，<a href="3643.htm">3643</a>，<a href="4060.htm">4060</a>，<a href="4321.htm">4321</a>e，<a href="4696.htm">4696</a>，<a href="5097.htm">5097</a>，<a href="5377.htm">5377</a>，<a href="7078.htm">7078</a>，<a href="7083.htm">7083</a>，<a href="7171.htm">7171</a>，<a href="7173.htm">7173</a>，<a href="8644.htm">8644</a>，<a href="8812.htm">8812</a>节）；因此，“日头一出，就变黑暗”表示这对主之爱无法与人共存；“月亮不放光”表示仁与信也是如此，因此那人再也不能重生。<br />“使人比精金还少，使人子比俄斐的金更稀罕”表示将再也看不到良善，也看不到真理；因为“人”表示教会的良善（<a href="4287.htm">4287</a>，<a href="8547.htm">8547</a>节），“人子”表示源于良善的真理，在至高意义上表示从主发出的神性真理（<a href="1729.htm">1729</a>，<a href="1733.htm">1733</a>，<a href="2813.htm">2813</a>，<a href="3704.htm">3704</a>节）。“凡被发现的，必被刺死”表示所有人都将因虚假的邪恶而灭亡；“凡被召聚的，必倒在剑下”表示他们将因虚假而灭亡。“被刺死”表示因虚假的邪恶而灭亡（参看<a href="4503.htm">4503</a>节）；“必倒在剑下”表示因虚假而灭亡（<a href="2799.htm">2799</a>，<a href="4499.htm">4499</a>，<a href="7102.htm">7102</a>，<a href="8294.htm">8294</a>节）。<br />“婴孩被摔碎”表示他们将彻底毁灭纯真，因为“婴孩”是指纯真（<a href="430.htm">430</a>，<a href="2126.htm">2126</a>，<a href="3183.htm">3183</a>，<a href="3494.htm">3494</a>，<a href="5608.htm">5608</a>节）。“妻子被玷污”表示真理之良善将被虚假的邪恶败坏，因为“妻子”是指真理之良善（<a href="2517.htm">2517</a>，<a href="4510.htm">4510</a>，<a href="4823.htm">4823</a>，<a href="7022.htm">7022</a>节），“被玷污”是指被败坏（参看<a href="2466.htm">2466</a>，<a href="4865.htm">4865</a>节）。“他们的弓箭必击碎少年人”表示良善之真理将通过邪恶所生的虚假的教义而灭亡；因为“弓”是指真理的教义，在反面意义上是指虚假的教义（<a href="2686.htm">2686</a>，<a href="6422.htm">6422</a>，<a href="8800.htm">8800</a>节）；“少年人”是指被证实的真理（<a href="7668.htm">7668</a>节）。“他们的眼也不顾惜儿子”表示那些理解真理的人将毁灭它们，因为“儿子”是指真理（<a href="489.htm">489</a>，<a href="491.htm">491</a>，<a href="533.htm">533</a>，<a href="1147.htm">1147</a>，<a href="2803.htm">2803</a>，<a href="2813.htm">2813</a>，<a href="3373.htm">3373</a>，<a href="4257.htm">4257</a>，<a href="5542.htm">5542</a>节）；“眼”是指看见真理的理解力（<a href="2701.htm">2701</a>，<a href="4403.htm">4403</a>-<a href="4421.htm">4421</a>，<a href="4523.htm">4523</a>-<a href="4534.htm">4534</a>节）。由此清楚可知当如何理解上面这段预言，即：当教会走到尽头时，一切信与仁，也就是一切真理与良善，都将毁灭。还清楚可知，“被刺死”和“被摔碎”，简言之，就是“被杀”，是指信与仁的毁灭。<br />耶利米书：<br />求你将他们拉出来，好像将宰的羊，给他们定下杀戮的日子。这地悲哀， 一切田野的草本枯干要到几时呢？因其上居民的恶行，牲畜和飞鸟都灭绝了。（耶利米书<a href="http://39-27.cn/耶12.3.htm">12:3</a>，<a href="http://39-27.cn/耶12.4.htm">4</a>）<br />“杀戮的日子”在此表示教会荒废的时候，也就是教会的末期，这时信不复存在，因为没有了仁；“这地悲哀”表示教会；“一切田野的青草枯干”表示教会的一切真理都要枯干；“牲畜和飞鸟都灭绝了”表良善和真理要灭绝。“地”是指教会，如刚才所述；“田野的草本”是指教会的真理（参看<a href="7571.htm">7571</a>节）；“田野”是指教会（<a href="2971.htm">2971</a>，<a href="3310.htm">3310</a>，<a href="3766.htm">3766</a>节）；“牲畜”是指良善和对良善的情感（<a href="45.htm">45</a>，<a href="46.htm">46</a>，<a href="142.htm">142</a>，<a href="143.htm">143</a>，<a href="246.htm">246</a>，<a href="714.htm">714</a>，<a href="715.htm">715</a>，<a href="719.htm">719</a>，<a href="1823.htm">1823</a>，<a href="2179.htm">2179</a>，<a href="2180.htm">2180</a>，<a href="3218.htm">3218</a>，<a href="3519.htm">3519</a>，<a href="5198.htm">5198</a>节）；“飞鸟”是指真理和对真理的情感（<a href="5149.htm">5149</a>，<a href="7441.htm">7441</a>节）。由此可见这些话的内义是什么，还可以看出教会和天堂的某种属灵和神圣之物存在于一切细节中；没有内义，人无论如何都不会明白“杀戮的日子”、“这地悲哀”、“一切田野的青草枯干”、“牲畜和飞鸟都灭绝了”分别表示什么。<br />撒迦利亚书：<br />耶和华我的神如此说，要牧养这将宰的羊。那些买了牠们的宰杀牠们，也不算为有罪。（撒迦利亚书<a href="http://39-27.cn/亚11.4.htm">11:4</a>，<a href="http://39-27.cn/亚11.5.htm">5</a>）<br />“将宰的羊”是指那些处于简单良善的人，他们里面的信之真理灭亡不是由于他们自己的错，而是由于教导者的错。<br />以赛亚书：<br />将来雅各要扎根，以色列要发芽开花，地面必满了出产。主击打他，岂像那击打之人的击打？他被杀戮，岂像被那杀戮他之人的杀戮？（以赛亚书<a href="http://39-27.cn/赛27.6.htm">27:6</a>，<a href="http://39-27.cn/赛27.7.htm">7</a>）<br /><br />看哪，耶和华从祂的居所出来，要刑罚那地的罪孽。地也必露出它的血，不再掩盖被杀的人。（以赛亚书<a href="http://39-27.cn/赛26.21.htm">26:21</a>）<br />此处在内义上论述的主题也是教会的末期，这时一个新教会将随着旧教会的灭亡而兴起。“雅各”表示那些处于教会外在的人；“以色列”表示那些处于教会内在的人；“地面”表示总体上的教会；“地”表示旧教会；“被杀的人”表示那些因没有仁而没有信在里面的人。<br /><br />你从你的坟墓被抛出，好像可憎的枝子，以被杀的人为衣，就是被剑刺透的。你不得与君王在坟墓同葬，因为你败坏你的地，杀戮你的民。（以赛亚书<a href="http://39-27.cn/赛14.19.htm">14:19</a>，<a href="http://39-27.cn/赛14.20.htm">20</a>）<br />“被杀的人”表示那些被剥夺属灵生命的人；“杀戮你的民”表示毁灭信之真理和良善。此处论述的是巴别，巴别表示对良善的亵渎（<a href="1182.htm">1182</a>，<a href="1283.htm">1283</a>，<a href="1295.htm">1295</a>，<a href="1306.htm">1306</a>-<a href="1308.htm">1308</a>，<a href="1321.htm">1321</a>，<a href="1322.htm">1322</a>，<a href="1326.htm">1326</a>节），以及它的荒废（<a href="1327.htm">1327</a>e节）。<br />耶利米书：<br /><br />Run to and fro through the streets of Jerusalem and see now，and take note，and search in its broad places，if you can find a man，if there is anyone executing judgement and seeking truth. Jer. 4:31；5:1.<br />我听见锡安女子的声音。她叹着气，伸开手说，我有祸了！我的灵魂因杀人者而疲倦。你们当在耶路撒冷的街上跑来跑去，留心看看，在宽阔之地寻找，能找到一人不；若真有一人行公平、求真理。（耶利米书<a href="http://39-27.cn/耶4.31.htm">4:31</a>；<a href="http://39-27.cn/耶5.1.htm">5:1</a>）<br />“锡安的女子”表示属天教会；“杀人者”表示那些毁灭良善和真理的人；“行公平的人”表示那些处于植根于良善的真理之人。<br />以西结书：<br />你们为几把大麦，为几块饼，在我民中亵渎我，杀死不该死的灵魂，救活不该活的灵魂。（以西结书<a href="http://39-27.cn/结13.19.htm">13:19</a>）<br />此处“杀灵魂”明显表示夺走属灵生命。由于“杀”也具有这种含义，所以以巴路山所宣布的咒诅就包括“暗中杀同伴的，受贿赂害死无辜之人的”（申命记<a href="http://39-27.cn/申27.24.htm">27:24</a>，<a href="http://39-27.cn/申27.25.htm">25</a>）。<br />马太福音：<br />时代完结的时候，人必将你们送交苦难中，杀害你们。你们必为我的名为各民族所憎恨。（马太福音<a href="http://39-27.cn/太24.9.htm">24:9</a>）<br />约翰福音：<br />耶稣对祂的门徒说，时刻就要到了，凡杀你们的，还以为是向神献上神圣敬拜；他们要作这些事，是因未曾认识父，也未曾认识我。（约翰福音<a href="http://39-27.cn/约16.2.htm">16:2</a>，<a href="http://39-27.cn/约16.3.htm">3</a>）<br />在这些经文中，“杀”也表示剥夺属灵生命，也就是信与仁；因为“门徒”表示信与仁之真理与良善的一切（<a href="3488.htm">3488</a>，<a href="3858.htm">3858</a>e，<a href="6397.htm">6397</a>节）。此处不是指主与之说话的门徒，这一点从以下事实明显看出来：所论述的主题是时代的完结，就是主要驾着天上的云降临的时候。门徒向主所问的时代的完结是指教会的末期，门徒活不到这个时候（参看<a href="3488.htm">3488</a>节）。<br />在马可福音也一样：<br />弟兄要把弟兄，父亲要把孩子，送到死地；孩子要起来反对父母，杀害他们。（马可福音<a href="http://39-27.cn/可13.12.htm">13:12</a>）<br />这也论及末期，“杀害”在此也表示剥夺信与仁的真理与良善，因而剥夺属灵生命。<br />路加福音：<br />我要差遣先知和使徒到他们那里去，其中有的他们要杀害，要逼迫；就是从亚伯的血起，直到先知撒迦利亚的血为止。这都要向这一代追讨。（路加福音<a href="http://39-27.cn/路11.49.htm">11:49</a>，<a href="http://39-27.cn/路11.51.htm">51</a>）<br />“先知和使徒”在灵义上表示教会的真理和良善；“杀害”表示灭绝它们；“亚伯的血”表示对仁的灭绝。“先知”表示源于圣言的教义真理（参看<a href="2534.htm">2534</a>，<a href="7269.htm">7269</a>节）；“亚伯的血”表示对仁的灭绝（<a href="374.htm">374</a>节）。<br />同样在启示录：<br />先知和圣徒，并地上一切被杀之人的血，都在巴比伦发现了。（启示录<a href="http://39-27.cn/启18.24.htm">18:24</a>）<br />此处“先知和圣徒的血”表示对信与仁的良善与真理的灭绝，“被杀之人”表示那些丧失属灵生命的人。“血”是指向仁所施的暴行，以及总体上的一切邪恶（<a href="374.htm">374</a>，<a href="1005.htm">1005</a>节）；尤指对真理的亵渎（<a href="4735.htm">4735</a>，<a href="6978.htm">6978</a>，<a href="7317.htm">7317</a>，<a href="7326.htm">7326</a>节）。<br />由于“被杀”或“被刺透或刺死”之人表示对良善与真理的灭绝，还由于建在犹太教会中的一切都是主国度中的属灵和属天事物、在至高意义上是主里面的神性事物或神性属性的代表，所以当发现倒在田野被刺死的人时，以下赦免的程序被吩咐给百姓，即：<br />他们要量一下从倒在田野的被刺死的人到城邑的距离，离得最近的那城的长老要从牛群中取一只未曾耕地、未曾负轭的母牛犊，把她牵到水流湍急的河谷。祭司利未的子孙要在那里打折母牛犊的颈项，那城的众长老，要在那母牛犊以上洗手，说，他们的手未曾流这血，他们的眼也未曾看见它；这样，流血的罪必得赦免。（申命记<a href="http://39-27.cn/申21.1.htm">21:1</a>-<a href="http://39-27.cn/申21.8.htm">8</a>）<br />若非从内义知道“倒在田野被刺死的人”、“最近的城”、“牛犊”、“水流湍急的河谷”、“洗水”和这个程序中所提到其它事表示什么，谁会知道为何这种程序因倒在田野的被刺死之人的缘故而设立？“在田野的被刺死之人”表示已经遭到灭绝的真理和良善（<a href="4503.htm">4503</a>节）；“田野”是指教会（<a href="2971.htm">2971</a>，<a href="3310.htm">3310</a>，<a href="3766.htm">3766</a>节）；“城”表示真理的教义（<a href="402.htm">402</a>，<a href="2449.htm">2449</a>，<a href="2943.htm">2943</a>，<a href="3216.htm">3216</a>，<a href="4492.htm">4492</a>，<a href="4493.htm">4493</a>节）；“那城的众长老”表示与良善一致的真理（<a href="6524.htm">6524</a>，<a href="6525.htm">6525</a>，<a href="8578.htm">8578</a>，<a href="8585.htm">8585</a>节）；“未曾负轭的母牛犊”表示还没有被证实或确认的真理，至于“母牛犊”表示什么，可参看前文（<a href="1824.htm">1824</a>，<a href="1825.htm">1825</a>节）；“在水流湍急的河谷，在那母牛犊以上洗手”表示从那不知道何为真理之人由于过度的热情所行的邪恶中洁净，<br />从上述经文，如从其它经文一样可以看出圣言的每一部分都包含了什么样的奥秘，这奥秘又是何等之大。诚然，若以为字义就是圣言的全部，因而以为圣言内在并未隐藏更神圣或更属天堂的任何事物，它们看上去不像奥秘。然而，字义是为了世人，也就是为了属世人；内义则是为了天上的人，也就是为了属灵人。由此可见“不可杀人”这一诫命里面都包含了些什么，即：不仅不可杀人的身体，而且也不可杀人的灵魂，因而不仅不可剥夺他在世上的生命，尤其不可剥夺他在天上的生命。如果这条诫命没有同时包含这后一种禁令在里面，那么耶和华自己，也就是主，就不会在西乃山上以如此大的神迹，用活生生的声音来宣布它。因为即便没有直接的启示，所有人民和民族都知道，并且他们的法律也都规定不可杀人，就像他们也知道不可奸淫、偷盗和作假见证一样。应该不会有人认为以色列民族就如此愚蠢，以至于唯独他们就不知道全世界所有民族都知道的事。但被启示的圣言因来自神自己，故还隐藏更深、更普世的真理在自己里面，即隐藏了与天堂有关的那类事；也就是说，它不仅包含了涉及肉体生命的真理，还包含了涉及灵魂生命或永生的真理。这使得圣言不同于其它一切着作，与它们相去甚远，并且远远比它们优越得多。</p>

Thou shalt not kill. That this signifies not to take away spiritual life from anyone, also not to extinguish faith and charity, as also not to hold the neighbor in hatred, is evident from the signification 
of "killing," as being to deprive of spiritual life. That "killing" means this in the internal sense, is because in this sense spiritual life, or the life of heaven with man, is treated of; and 
spiritual life, or the life of heaven with man, is the life of faith and of charity; therefore by "not to kill" is signified also not to extinguish faith and charity in anyone. The reason why "not to 
kill" is also in the internal sense not to hold the neighbor in hatred, is that he who holds in hatred continually wishes to kill, and also would kill in act unless prevented by the fear of the penalty, 
of the loss of life, of reputation, and the like. For hatred is of evil, is contrary to charity, and breathes nothing but the murder of him whom it hates: in the world the murder of his body; in the 
other life the murder of his soul. This is meant by the words of the Lord in Matthew: </p>
<p>     Ye have heard that it was said to them of old time, Thou shalt not kill; and whosoever shall kill shall be 
in danger of the judgment; but I say unto you, that whosoever is angry with his brother rashly shall be in danger of the judgment; and whosoever shall say to his brother, Raca, shall be in danger of 
the council; and whosoever shall say, Thou fool, shall be in danger of the Gehenna of fire (Matt. 5:21, 22). Hatred against the neighbor is meant by being "angry with the brother rashly," and the degrees 
of its increase are described by saying to him "Raca," and by calling him "a fool" (that anger is a turning away from charity, and is from evil, thus that it is hatred, see n. 357, 4164, 5034, 5798, 
5887, 5888). [2] That in the internal sense "to kill" denotes to take away spiritual life from anyone, consequently to extinguish faith and charity, is evident from almost all the passages in the 
Word where a "killing," or "to kill," is mentioned, as in Isaiah: </p>
<p>     Behold the day of Jehovah cometh, cruel, and of indignation, and of wrath, and of anger; to make the land a waste, and He shall 
destroy the sinners thereof out of it. Then the stars of the heavens and the constellations thereof shall not shine with their light, the sun shall be darkened in his rising, and the moon shall not 
cause her light to shine. I will visit the wickedness upon the world, and their iniquity upon the wicked. I will make a man more rare than pure gold, and the son of man than the gold of Ophir. Everyone 
that is found shall be thrust through, and everyone that is gathered shall fall by the sword. Their infants shall be dashed in pieces before their eyes; their houses shall be spoiled, and their wives 
ravished. Their bows shall dash the young men in pieces, their eye shall not spare sons (Isa. 13:9-12, 15, 16, 18). The subject treated of in this passage is the last time of the church, when there 
is no longer any faith and charity, which time is "the day of Jehovah cruel, full of indignation, of wrath, and of anger." Everyone can see that something else is here meant than that which the words 
nakedly declare; but what is meant cannot be known except from the significations of the words in their spiritual sense. In this sense "the land" denotes the church (n. 566, 662, 1067, 1262, 1413, 1607, 
1733, 1850, 2117, 2118, 2928, 3355, 4447, 4535, 5577, 8011, 8732); therefore "to make the land a waste, and to destroy the sinners out of it" signifies that the man of the church is then without faith 
and charity. [3] "Stars" and "constellations" denote the knowledges of truth and good (see n. 2120, 2495, 2849, 4697), and these are said "not to shine with their light," when they are no longer 
illuminated by the light of heaven which flows in through the faith of charity. That "the sun" denotes love to the Lord, and "the moon" faith in Him, see n. 2120, 2441, 2494, 3636, 3643, 4060, 4321, 
4696, 5097, 5377, 7078, 7083, 7171, 7173, 8644, 8812; therefore "the sun being darkened in his rising," signifies that love to the Lord cannot arise with man; and "the moon not causing her light to shine," 
signifies that neither can charity and faith arise, thus that man cannot any longer be regenerated. [4] "To make a man more rare than pure gold, and the son of man than the gold of Ophir," signifies 
that good is no longer seen, nor truth; for by "man" is signified the good of the church (n. 4287, 8547), and by "the son of man" truth from good, in the supreme sense the Divine truth proceeding 
from the Lord (n. 1729, 1733, 2813, 3704). That "everyone found shall be thrust through" signifies that all will perish by reason of the evil of falsity; and that "everyone that is gathered shall fall 
by the sword" signifies that they will perish by reason of falsity (that "to be thrust through" denotes to perish by reason of the evil of falsity, see n. 4503; also that "to fall by the sword" denotes 
to perish by reason of falsity, n. 2799, 4499, 7102, 8294). [5] The "infants being dashed in pieces" signifies that they will utterly extinguish innocence, for "infants" denote innocence (n. 430, 
2126, 3183, 3494, 5608). The "wives being ravished" signifies that the goods of truth will be perverted by the evils of falsity, for "wives" denote the goods of truth (n. 2517, 4510, 4823, 7022), and 
"to be ravished" denotes to be perverted (see n. 2466, 4865). That "their bows shall dash the young men in pieces" signifies that the truths of good will perish through the doctrines of falsity from 
evil; for a "bow" denotes the doctrine of truth, and in the opposite sense the doctrine of falsity (n. 2686, 6422, 8800); "young men" denote truths confirmed (n. 7668). "And their eye shall not spare 
sons" signifies that he who understands truths will nevertheless extinguish them, for "sons" denote truths (n. 489, 491, 533, 1147, 2803, 2813, 3373, 4257, 5542); and "the eye" denotes the understanding 
of truth (n. 2701, 4403-4421, 4523-4534). From all this it is now clear what is meant by the above prophetic words, namely, that when the church arrives at its end, all truth and all good will perish. 
It is also evident from what has been said, that "to be thrust through," "to be dashed in pieces," in a word "to be killed," denotes the extinction of faith and charity. [6] In Jeremiah: </p>
<p>     Drag 
them away like a sheep for the slaughter, and destine them for the day of killing. How long shall the land mourn, and the herb of every field wither? For the wickedness of them that dwell therein, 
the beasts shall be consumed and the bird (Jer. 12:3, 4). "The day of killing" here denotes the time of the vastated church, which is its last time, when there is no longer faith because there is no 
charity; "the land shall mourn" denotes the church; "the herb of every field shall wither" denotes that every truth of the church will do so; "the beasts and the bird shall be consumed" denotes that 
goods and truths will be so. (That "the land" denotes the church, see just above; that "the herb of the field" denotes the truth of the church, see n. 7571; that "the field" denotes the church, n. 2971, 
3310, 3766; that "beasts" denote goods and the affections of good, n. 45, 46, 142, 143, 246, 714, 715, 719, 1823, 2179, 2180, 3218, 3519, 5198; that "birds" denote truths and the affections of truth, 
n. 5149, 7441.) From all this it can be seen what is the internal sense of these words, and also that what is spiritual and holy of the church and of heaven is in all the particulars; and that without 
the internal sense it would not in any wise be understood what is meant by "the day of killing," by that "the earth shall mourn," that "every herb of the field shall wither," and that "the beasts 
and the bird shall then be consumed." [7] In Zechariah: </p>
<p>     Thus said Jehovah thy God, Feed the sheep of the killing, whose possessors kill them, and do not own themselves guilty (Zech. 11:4, 5); </p>
<p>where 
"the sheep of the killing" denote those who are in simple good, in whom the truths of faith are extinguished, not by their own fault, but by the fault of those who teach. [8] In Isaiah: </p>
<p>     In 
those that are to come shall Jacob take root; Israel shall blossom and flower; so that the faces of the world shall be filled with produce. Hath he smitten him according to the stroke of him that smote? 
is he killed according to the slaughter of his killed? (Isa. 27:6, 7).      Behold, Jehovah cometh forth out of His place to visit the iniquity of the land; then shall the land uncover its bloods, 
and shall not hide its killed (Isa. 26:21). Here also in the internal sense the subject treated of is the last time of the church, when a new church shall be resuscitated, the old perishing. "Jacob" 
denotes those who are in the external of the church; "Israel" those who are in the internal; "the faces of the world" denote the church in general; "the land" denotes the old church; "the killed" those 
in whom there is no faith because no charity. [9] In the same: </p>
<p>     Thou art cast forth out of thy sepulcher like an abominable shoot, a vestment of the killed, thrust through with the sword. Thou 
shalt not be united with them in the grave, because thou hast destroyed thy land, thou hast killed thy people (Isa. 14:19, 20). "The killed" denote those who have been deprived of spiritual life; 
"thou hast killed thy people" denotes the destruction of the truths and goods of faith. Babel is here treated of, by which is signified the profanation of good (n. 1182, 1283, 1295, 1306-1308, 1321, 
1322, 1326), and also its vastation (n. 1327). [10] In Jeremiah: </p>
<p>     I have heard the voice of the daughter of Zion, she sigheth, she spreadeth out her hands, saying, Woe is me now, for my soul is 
wearied because of killers. Run ye to and fro through the streets of Jerusalem, and see I pray, and know, and seek in the avenues thereof, if ye can find a man, if there be any that doeth judgment, that 
seeketh truth (Jer. 4:31; 5:1). "The daughter of Zion" denotes the celestial church; "killers," those who destroy goods and truths; "a man who doeth judgment," denotes those who are in truths from 
good. [11] In Ezekiel: </p>
<p>     Ye have profaned Me among My people for handfuls of barley and for pieces of bread, to kill the souls that should not die, and to keep the souls alive that should not live 
(Ezek. 13:19). "To kill souls" here plainly denotes to take away spiritual life. As "killing" had also this signification, therefore it was one of the curses upon Mount Ebal, "to slay one's companion 
in secret, and to take a gift to kill the soul innocent of blood" (Deut. 27:24, 25). [12] Again: </p>
<p>     In the consummation of the age they shall deliver you into tribulation, and shall kill you; 
and ye shall be hated of all the nations for My name's sake (Matt. 24:9).      Jesus said to His disciples, The hour cometh, that whosoever killeth you shall think that he offereth holy worship to God; 
and these things will they do, because they know not the Father, nor Me (John 16:2, 3). In these passages also by "killing" is signified to deprive of spiritual life, that is, of faith and charity; 
for by "the disciples" are signified all things of the truth and good of faith and charity (n. 3488, 3858, 6397). That the disciples to whom the Lord spoke are not here meant, is evident from the fact 
that the subject treated of is the consummation of the age, when the Lord is to come in the clouds of heaven, concerning which the disciples had asked, and by which is meant the last time of the church, 
when the disciples would not be alive (see n. 3488). [13] In like manner in Mark: </p>
<p>     Brother shall deliver up brother to death, and the father his children; children shall rise up against parents, 
and shall kill them (Mark 13:12). Here also the last times are treated of, and by "killing" here also is signified to deprive of the truths and goods which are of faith and charity, thus of spiritual 
life. [14] In Luke: </p>
<p>     I will send unto them prophets and apostles; but some of them they shall kill and persecute; from the blood of Abel unto the blood of Zachariah the prophet it shall 
be required of this generation (Luke 11:49, 51). "Prophets and apostles" denote in the spiritual sense the truths and goods of the church; "to kill" denotes to extinguish them; "the blood of Abel" denotes 
the extinction of charity. (That "prophets" denote the truths of doctrine from the Word, see n. 2534, 7269; and that "the blood of Abel" denotes the extinction of charity, n. 374.) [15] In like 
manner in John: </p>
<p>     The blood of saints, and of prophets, and of the killed, was found in Babylon (Rev. 18:24); </p>
<p>where also "the blood of saints and of prophets" denotes the extinction of the good 
and truth of faith and charity, and "the killed" denote those who have perished as to spiritual life. (That "blood" denotes violence done to charity, as well as all evil in general, n. 374, 1005; as also, 
specifically, the profanation of truth, n. 4735, 6978, 7317, 7326.) [16] As by one "killed," or "thrust through," is signified the extinction of good and truth, and as all things which were instituted 
in the Jewish Church were representative of the spiritual and celestial things in the Lord's kingdom, and in the supreme sense, of the Divine things in the Lord, therefore when one was found lying 
in the field thrust through, the following procedure of expiation for the people was commanded, namely: </p>
<p>     They were to measure toward the cities from him that was lying in the field thrust through, 
and the elders of the nearest city were to take a she-calf of an ox, by which no labor had yet been done, and upon which there had not yet been a yoke, and were to bring her down to a rapid stream, 
and the priests, the sons of Levi, were to behead her there, and then the elders of the city were to wash their hands over the calf, and were to say that their hands had not shed that blood, neither 
had their eyes seen it, and that thus the blood would be expiated (Deut. 21:1-8). Who would ever know why such a procedure was instituted on account of one lying in the field thrust through, unless 
it were known from the internal sense what is signified by "one in a field thrust through," by "the nearest city," by "a calf," by "a rapid stream," by "the washing of hands," and by the other things 
there mentioned? By "one in the field thrust through" is signified truth and good extinguished (n. 4503); by "field," the church (n. 2971, 3310, 3766); by "city," the doctrine of truth (n. 402, 2449, 
2943, 3216, 4492, 4493); by "the elders of the city," truths agreeing with good (n. 6524, 6525, 8578, 8585); by "a calf upon which there had not yet been a yoke," truth not as yet confirmed (what "a 
calf" signifies, see n. 1824, 1825); by "washing the hands over the calf at a rapid stream" is signified purification from that evil, because done from the immoderate zeal of one ignorant of what truth 
is. [17] From the above, as from the other passages, it can be seen what and how great arcana are contained in the particulars of the Word, which will not appear even as arcana if it is believed that 
the sense of the letter is the whole of the Word; and thus it will not be believed that anything more holy and heavenly lies inwardly hidden therein; when yet the sense of the letter is for man in 
the world, that is, for the natural man; while the internal sense is for man in heaven, that is, for the spiritual man. Hence it is plain what is involved in the commandment "not to kill," namely, that 
not only is man not to be killed as to the body, but also that he is not to be killed as to the soul; thus that he is not only not to be deprived of life in the world, but especially that he is not 
to be deprived of life in heaven. If this commandment had not involved within it at the same time this meaning, it would not have been pronounced by Jehovah Himself, that is, the Lord, in a living voice 
upon Mount Sinai with so great a miracle; for all peoples and nations know without immediate revelation, and moreover their laws decree, that man is not to be killed, as also that adultery, theft, 
and false witness are not to be committed. Neither is it to be believed that the Israelitish nation was so stupid as alone to be ignorant of what all other nations on the globe know. But the revealed 
Word, being from the Divine Itself, over and above this stores up in its bosom higher and more universal things, namely, such things as are of heaven, thus which not only concern the life of the body, 
but which also concern the life of the soul, or eternal life. Herein the Word differs from, is separated from, and is preeminent over, all other writing. </p>

<p align="center"><b>Elliott(1983-1999) 8902</b></p><p><b>8902.</b>
'You shall not kill' means not taking the spiritual life away from anyone, also not destroying faith and charity, and not hating the neighbour. This is clear from the meaning of 'killing' as depriving 
of spiritual life. The reason why 'killing' has this meaning in the internal sense is that the internal sense deals with the spiritual life or life of heaven with a person; and since the spiritual life 
or life of heaven with a person is the life of faith and charity, 'not killing' also means not destroying the faith and charity present with anyone. The reason why 'not killing' also means in the 
internal sense not hating the neighbour is that someone who hates his neighbour is wanting all the time to kill him and would actually do so if there were no fear of punishment, of loss of life or reputation, 
or other such fears to hold him back For hatred springs from evil, is opposed to charity, and is intent on nothing other than the murder of the one who is hated - in the world the murder of his 
body, in the next life the murder of his soul. This is meant by the Lord's words in Matthew, </p>
<blockquote>
You have heard that it was said to those of old, You shall not kill; and whoever kills will be liable 
to judgement. But I say to you that whoever is angry with his brother without cause will be liable to judgement Whoever indeed says to his brother, Raca! will be liable to the Sanhedrin. And whoever 
says, You fool! will be liable to the Gehenna of fire. <a href="http://bible.gospelcom.net/cgi-bin/bible?passage=Matt%205:21,%2022&amp;version=ESV&amp;interface=print&amp;showfn=yes&amp;showxref">Matt 5:21, 22</a>

<p>Hatred towards the neighbour is meant by 'being angry without cause with his brother', and degrees of greater hatred are described 
by saying to him, Raca! and calling him, You fool' Regarding 'anger', that it is a turning away from charity and springs from evil, thus that it is hatred, see <a href="357.htm">357</a>, <a href="4164.htm">4164</a>, <a href="5034.htm">5034</a>, <a href="5798.htm">5798</a>, <a href="5887.htm">5887</a>, <a href="5888.htm">5888</a>. </p>

The fact that 'killing' in the internal sense means taking the spiritual life away from anyone, consequently destroying faith and charity, is clear from almost all the places in the Word that 
mention 'killing', such as in Isaiah, </p>
<blockquote>
Behold, the day of Jehovah comes, cruel, and [full] of indignation and wrath and anger, to make the earth a waste, so that<A name="fntext1"></a><A href="#fn1"><sup>a</sup></a> He may destroy its sinners from it. 
At that time the stars of heaven and their constellations will not shine with their light. The sun will be darkened in its rising, and the moon will not cause its light to shine. I will visit the world 
for its malice, and the wicked for their iniquity I will make man (homo) more rare than pure gold, and the son of man than the gold of Ophir. Everyone that is found will be slain, and everyone that

<p>This refers to the final period of the Church, when faith and charity do not exist any longer; that period is meant by 'the day of Jehovah, cruel, 
full of indignation, wrath, and anger'. Anyone may see that something other is meant here than that which the words describe literally; yet what is meant cannot be known except from the meanings which 
the words carry in the spiritual sense. In the spiritual sense 'the earth' or 'the land' is the Church, see <a href="566.htm">566</a>, <a href="662.htm">662</a>, <a href="1067.htm">1067</a>, <a href="1262.htm">1262</a>, <a href="1413.htm">1413</a>, <a href="1607.htm">1607</a>, <a href="1733.htm">1733</a>, <a href="1850.htm">1850</a>, <a href="2117.htm">2117</a>, <a href="2118.htm">2118</a>(end), <a href="2928.htm">2928</a>, <a href="3355.htm">3355</a>, <a href="4447.htm">4447</a>, <a href="4535.htm">4535</a>, <a href="5577.htm">5577</a>, <a href="8011.htm">8011</a>, <a href="8732.htm">8732</a>, so that 'making the earth a waste, and destroying sinners from it' means the members of the Church at that fume, devoid of faith and charity. </p>

words, namely that when the Church reaches its end all faith and all charity, that is, all truth and all good, are going to be destroyed. It is also evident that 'being thrust through' and 'being dashed 
to pieces', in short 'being killed', is the annihilation of faith and charity. </p>

From all this one may see what the internal sense 
of those words is. One may also see that some spiritual and holy feature of the Church and of heaven is present in every detail, and that without the internal sense no one would have any understanding 
at all of what 'the day of killing' means, what 'the land will mourn' means, or 'the plant of every field will wither', or 'the beasts and the birds will at that time be devoured'. </p>

 In Isaiah, </p>
<blockquote>
Those who are to come Jacob will cause to take root Israel will 
blossom and flower, so that the face of the earth (orbis) may be filled with produce Has he struck him as with the stroke of one who strikes? Has he been killed as at the slaughter of his killed ones?

26:21. </p>
<p>This too refers in the internal sense to the final period of the Church, when a new Church will be raised up as the old is passing out of existence 'Jacob' stands for those in the external part 
of the Church, 'Israel' for those in the internal part. 'The face of the earth' (orbis) stands for the Church in general, 'the earth' (terra) for the old Church, 'the killed ones' for those with whom 
there is no faith because there is no charity. </p>

<p><b>[9]</b>
 In the same prophet, </p>
<blockquote>
You are cast out from your sepulchre like an abominable branch, [like] a garment of the killed, [like] those slain with

<p>'The killed' stands for those who have been deprived of 
spiritual life, 'you have killed your people' stands for the destruction of the truths and forms of the good of faith. This is said in reference to Babel, by which the profanation of good is meant,

 In Jeremiah, </p>
<blockquote>
I have heard the voice of the daughter of Zion; she sighs, she spreads out her hands, 
[saying,] Woe is me now, for my soul has been wearied by killers! Run to and fro through the streets of Jerusalem and see now, and take note, and search in its broad places, if you can find a man, if 
there is anyone executing judgement and seeking truth. <a href="http://bible.gospelcom.net/cgi-bin/bible?passage=Jer%204:31;%205:1&amp;version=ESV&amp;interface=print&amp;showfn=yes&amp;showxref">Jer 4:31; 5:1</a>. 
</blockquote>
<p>'The daughter of Zion' stands for the celestial Church, 'killers' for those who destroy forms of good and truths, 'a man' and 
'anyone executing judgement' for those guided by truths rooted in good. </p>
<p></p>
<p><b>[11]</b>
 In Ezekiel, </p>

You have desecrated Me among My people for handfuls of barley and for crusts of bread, to dill souls that

</blockquote>
<p>Here 'killing souls' plainly stands for taking spiritual life away Because 'killing' had this meaning also, the actions 
that were cursed on Mount Ebal included killing a companion secretly and taking a bribe to kill an innocent person,<A name="fntext5"></a><A href="#fn5"><sup>e</sup></a> <a href="http://bible.gospelcom.net/cgi-bin/bible?passage=Deut%2027:24,%2025&amp;version=ESV&amp;interface=print&amp;showfn=yes&amp;showxref">Deut 27:24, 25</a>. </p>

 In Matthew, </p>

At the close of the age they will deliver 
you up to affliction, and will kill you, and you will be hated by all nations for My name's sake. <a href="http://bible.gospelcom.net/cgi-bin/bible?passage=Matt%2024:9&amp;version=ESV&amp;interface=print&amp;showfn=yes&amp;showxref">Matt 24:9</a>.

<p>And in John, </p>
<blockquote>
Jesus said to the disciples, The hour will come that everyone who kills 
you will think that he offers holy worship to God And these things they will do because they do not know the Father nor Me. <a href="http://bible.gospelcom.net/cgi-bin/bible?passage=John%2016:2,%203&amp;version=ESV&amp;interface=print&amp;showfn=yes&amp;showxref">John 16:2, 3</a>. 
</blockquote>
<p>In these places also 'killing' means depriving of spiritual 
life, that is, of faith and charity; for all aspects of the truth and good of faith and charity are meant by 'the disciples', <a href="3488.htm">3488</a>, <a href="3858.htm">3858</a> (end), <a href="6397.htm">6397</a>. The fact that it is not the disciples to whom 
the Lord was speaking who are meant there is evident from the consideration that in those places the subject is the close of the age, when the Lord is going to come in the clouds of heaven. And the 
close of the age which the disciples asked Him about means the final period of the Church, at which time the disciples would not be alive, see <a href="3488.htm">3488</a>. </p>

<p>This too refers to the last times, and again 'killing' means depriving of the

<p>'Prophets and apostles' stands in the spiritual sense for the Church's truths and forms

</blockquote>
<p>Here also 'the 
blood of saints and prophets' stands for the annihilation of the good and truth of faith and charity, 'the killed' for those who have lost their spiritual life - 'blood' being violence done to charity, 
as well as all evil in general, <a href="374.htm">374</a>,<a href="1005.htm">1005</a>, and the profanation of truth in particular, <a href="4735.htm">4735</a>, <a href="6978.htm">6978</a>, <a href="7317.htm">7317</a>, <a href="7326.htm">7326</a>. </p>

<p><b>[16]</b>
 Since the annihilation of goodness and truth is meant by one who has been 'killed' 
or 'slain', and since all that had been established in the Jewish Church was representative of spiritual and celestial realities in the Lord's kingdom, and in the highest sense of Divine attributes 
in the Lord, the following procedure to expiate the people was commanded if someone was found slain, lying in the field, </p>
<blockquote>
They were to measure the distances to the cities from the one slain, lying 
in the field. Then the elders of the nearest city were to take a heifer by means of which  no work had been done, and on which  the yoke had not yet been laid, and to bring it down to a fast-flowing 
river. The priests, the sons of Levi, were to break its neck there, and then the elders of the city were to wash their hands over the heifer and to say that their hands had not shed that blood, nor had 
their eves seen it, and that in this way the blood would be expiated. <a href="http://bible.gospelcom.net/cgi-bin/bible?passage=Deut%2021:1-8&amp;version=ESV&amp;interface=print&amp;showfn=yes&amp;showxref">Deut 21:1-8</a>. 
</blockquote>
<p>Could anyone ever know why such a procedure was established on account of someone who had been slain and was lying 
in the field, unless it were known from the internal sense what is meant by 'one slain, in the field', by 'the nearest city', by 'a heifer', by 'a fast-flowing river', by 'washing the hands', and 
by everything else in the procedure? 'One slain, in the field' means truth and good that have been annihilated, <a href="4503.htm">4503</a>, 'the field' being the Church, <a href="2971.htm">2971</a>, <a href="3310.htm">3310</a>, <a href="3766.htm">3766</a> 'The city' means teachings composed

 From these as from all other places one may see what the arcana are, and how great they are, which every 
part of the Word contains. They will not, it is true, be seen as arcana by a person if he believes that the literal sense is all there is to the Word, and so believes that nothing holier or more heavenly 
lies inwardly in it. However, the literal sense is for a person in the world, that is, for the natural man, whereas the internal sense is for one in heaven, that is, for the spiritual man. From this 
one may see what the commandment about not killing holds within it, namely not only that a person's body must not be killed but that his soul must not be killed either, thus not only that he must not 
be deprived of life in the world but in particular that he must not be deprived of life in heaven. If that commandment had not at the same time held the latter prohibition within it, ]Jehovah Himself, 
that is, the Lord, would not have declared it on Mount Sinai in so miraculous a way by an actual voice. For all peoples and nations without direct revelation know, and also their laws decree that 
a person must not be killed, even as they know that adultery, theft, and false witness are forbidden. Nor should anyone think that the Israelite nation were so stupid that they alone did not know what 
all throughout the world knew. But because the Word that has been revealed comes from God Himself, it in addition conceals deeper and more universal truths within itself, namely the kind that have to 
do with heaven; that is, it holds not only truths which concern the life of the body but also those that concern the life of the soul or eternal life This makes the Word different, far removed from and 
superior to anything else that has been written.

`Non occides': quod significet non vitam spiritualem alicui adimere, tum non fidem et charitatem exstinguere, ut et proximum non odio habere, constat ex significatione `occidere' quod sit privare vita

erat {22} super monte Ebal, occidere socium in occulto et accipere munus ad occidendum animam sanguinis innocentis, Deut. xxvii (x)24, 25: [12] apud Matthaeum, 	In consummatione saeculi tradent 
vos in tribulationem, et occident vos, et eritis odio habiti ab omnibus gentibus propter nomen Meum, xxiv 9: </p>
<p>et apud Johannem, 	Jesus ad discipulos, Veniet hora ut omnis qui occiderit vos putet cultum 
sacrum offerre Deo; et haec facient quia non cognoscent Patrem, nec Me, xvi 2, 3; </p>
<p>hic quoque per `occidere' significatur privare vita spirituali, hoc est, fide et charitate, nam per `discipulos' 
significantur omnia veri et boni fidei et charitatis, n. 3488, 3858 fin., 6397; quod non discipuli, ad quos Dominus locutus est, hic intelligantur, patet ex eo quod ibi agatur de consummatione saeculi, 
(o)quando Dominus venturus est in nubibus caeli, de qua discipuli quaesiverunt, per quam intelligitur ultimum tempus Ecclesiae, quo tempore discipuli non victuri erant {23}, videatur n. 3488: [13] similiter 
apud Marcum, 	Tradet frater fratrem in mortem, et, pater liberos; consurgent liberi contra parentes, et occident illos, xiii 12; </p>
<p>ibi etiam de ultimis temporibus (o)agitur, ubi (o)quoque per 
`occidere' {24} significatur privare veris et bonis quae fidei et charitatis, (o)ita vita spirituali: [14] apud Lucam, 	Mittam ad eos prophetas et apostolos, sed ex illis occident et persequentur: a 
sanguine Abelis ad sanguinem Sachariae prophetae requiretur a generatione hac, xi 49, 51; </p>
<p>`prophetae et apostoli' in sensu spirituali pro veris et bonis Ecclesiae, `occidere' pro exstinguere illa, `sanguis 
Abelis' pro exstinctione charitatis; `prophetae' quod sint vera doctrinae {25} ex Verbo, (d)videatur n. 2534, 7269, `sanguis Abelis' quod sit exstinctio charitatis, n. 374: [15] similiter apud 
Johannem, 		Sanguis sanctorum et prophetarum, ac occisorum, inventus est in Babylone, Apoc. xviii (x)24; </p>
<p>ibi etiam `sanguis sanctorum et prophetarum' pro exstinctione boni et veri fidei et charitatis, 
`occisi' pro illis qui quoad vitam spiritualem perierunt; quod `sanguis' sit violentia illata charitati, ut et omne malum in genere, n. 374, (x)1005, tum {26} profanatio veri in specie, n. 4735, (x)6978, 
7317, 7326. 	[16] Quia per `occisum' seu `confossum' significatur exstinctio (x) boni et veri, et in Ecclesia Judaica omnia quae instituta sunt erant repraesentativa spiritualium et caelestium 
quae in regno Domini, ac in supremo sensu Divinorum in Domino, quapropter {27} quando confossus in agro jacens inventus fuit {28}, talis processus expiandi populum mandatus est; quod nempe 	Metirentur 
versus urbes a confosso jacente in agro, et quod seniores urbis proximae sumerent vitulam bovis, per quam labor nullus factus est et super qua nondum jugum (o)fuerat, ac deducerent ad fluvium rapidum, 
et decollarent (t)illam ibi sacerdotes, filii Levi, ac tunc seniores urbis lavarent manus super vitula, et dicerent {29} quod manus eorum non effuderint sanguinem illum, nec oculi (c)illorum viderint, 
et quod sic expiaretur sanguis, Deut. xxi 1-8; </p>
<p>quis unquam sciret cur talis processus institutus est {30} propter confossum jacentem in agro, {31} nisi ex sensu interno sciretur quid significatur 
per `confossum in agro,' per `urbem proximam,' per `vitulam,' per `fluvium rapidum,' per `lavationem manuum,' et per reliqua ibi; per `confossum in agro' significatur verum et bonum {32} exstinctum, 
n. 4503, per `agrum' {33} Ecclesia, n. 2971, 3310, 3766, per `urbem' doctrina (o)veri, n. 402, (x)2449, 2943, 3216, 4492, 4493, per `seniores urbis' vera concordantia {34} bono, n. (x)6524, 6525, 8578, 
8585, per `vitulam super qua nondum jugum' verum {35} nondum confirmatum, quid (x)`vitula,' n. 1824, 1825, per `lavationem manuum super vitula ad flumen rapidum' {36} purificatio a malo illo quia 
factum ex zelo immoderato qui ignorantis quid verum. 	[17] Ex his sicut ex reliquis constare potest quae et quanta arcana in singulis Verbi continentur, quae ne quidem ut arcana apparitura sunt, si credatur 
quod sensus litterae sit omne Verbi, ac ita quod non sanctius et caelestius intus inibi lateat; cum tamen sensus litterae est pro homine in mundo, hoc est, pro homine naturali, at sensus internus 
pro homine in caelo, hoc est, pro homine spirituali; inde patet quid praeceptum de non occidere involvit, quod nempe non solum {37} homo non occidendus quoad corpus sed etiam non occidendus quoad 
animam, ita non solum non privandus vita in mundo sed imprimis quod non privandus vita in caelo; si praeceptum illud non hoc simul involvisset, non ab Ipso Jehovah, hoc est, Domino, viva voce dictatum 
fuisset super monte Sinai cum tanto miraculo, omnes enim populi et gentes absque immediata revelatione sciunt, et quoque leges eorum sanciunt, quod homo non (x)occidendus, sicut etiam quod non adulterandum, 
non furandum, non testandum false; (m)nec credendum quod gens Israelitica tam stupida fuerit {38} ut quae omnes in universo terrarum orbe sciverunt, illa sole nesciverit;(n) sed Verbum revelatum, 
quia ab ipso Divino, insuper in sinu suo altiora et universaliora recondit, nempe talia quae caeli sunt, ita quae non solum vitam corporis sed etiam quae vitam animae seu vitam aeternam concernunt; 
in hoc differt, distat, et eminet Verbum super omni alio scripto. @1 similia externa$ @2 i hic$ @3 A has a space for these paragraph numbers but they are not written out.$ @4 cum non amplius fides,
