<h3 align="center" class="ired">属天的奥秘 第6370节</h3>
<h4 align="center"></h4><p><strong>6370.</strong>“谁敢惹他”表他在地狱里的所有人当中是安全的。这从“谁敢惹他”的含义清楚可知，“谁敢惹他”是指安全。它之所以表示在地狱里的所有人当中，是因为他在各种邪恶当中是安全的，甚至在地狱中间也是安全的。对主和对邻之爱就具有这种安全性，因为处于这爱的人与主联结得最为紧密；他们住在主里面，因为他们住在从主发出的神性里面；因此，没有任何邪恶能触及他们。要知道，无数地狱照着邪恶和衍生的虚假的属，以及构成这些属的种类和构成这些种类的细节而彼此有别，互相分离。而且，每个地狱都有秩序；这秩序由主既直接，又间接通过属天天使来维持。有时天使也被派往那里，使那些失去秩序的事物恢复秩序；天使在那里是十分安全的。这就是处于属天之物的人在地狱里的所有人当中是安全的这句话的意思。</p>

Who shall rouse him up? That this signifies that he is safe among all in the hells, is evident from the signification of "who shall rouse him up," as being to be safe. That it denotes among all in the 
hells is because he is safe among all evils, even in the midst of the hells; for love to the Lord and toward the neighbor has this effect, because they who are in this love are most closely conjoined 
with the Lord, and are in the Lord, because they are in the Divine which proceeds from Him; hence nothing of evil can reach them. Be it known that there are innumerable hells, distinct according to 
the genera of evils and the derivative falsities, and according to the species of these, and the details of the species; and that in each hell there is order; and that this order is preserved by the Lord, 
both immediately, and mediately through the celestial angels; at times also angels are sent thither to bring into order what is disorderly there; and when they are there, they are in safety. This 
is what is meant by the safety among all in the hells of him who is in what is celestial. </p>

<p align="center"><b>Elliott(1983-1999) 6370</b></p><p><b>6370.</b>
'Who will rouse him?' means that he is safe when among all those in the hells. This is clear from the meaning of 'who will rouse?' as being safe. The reason why among all those in the hells is meant 
is that he is safe when among all kinds of evil, even when in the midst of the hells. Love to the Lord and love towards the neighbour hold such safety, for the reason that people governed by that love 
are those who are joined most closely to the Lord; and they abide in the Lord because they abide in what is Divine going forth from Him. That is why no evil can touch them. It should be recognized that 
the countless hells are distinct and separate from one another, in keeping with the genera of all the evils and derivative falsities that exist, and with the species making up those genera, and with 
the individual members making up those species. Also, in each hell order exists, and that order is preserved both directly by the Lord and indirectly through celestial angels. Sometimes angels are also 
sent into the hells to restore to order things which have got out of order; and while they are there they are quite safe. This is what is meant when it is said that one with whom what is celestial 
exists is safe when among all those in the hells. </p>

</p><b>6370.</b>
`Quis suscitabit eum ?':  quod significet quod tutus sit inter omnes in infernis, constat ex significatione `quis suscitabit' quod sit tutus esse; quod sit inter omnes in infernis, est quia tutus est 
inter omnia mala, etiam in {1}mediis infernis; amor enim in Dominum et amor erga proximum hoc secum {2}habent, ex causa {3}quia illi qui in eo amore sunt, conjunctissimi Domino sunt, ac in Domino quia 
in Divino quod procedit ab Ipso; inde nihil mali ad eos potest attingere.  Sciendum est quod innumerabilia inferna sint distincta secundum {4}omnium malorum et inde falsorum genera, et secundum eorum 
species, et specierum singula; et quod in {5}unoquoque inferno sit ordo; et quod ille ordo conservetur a Domino tam immediate quam {6} mediate per angelos caelestes; quandoque etiam illuc mittuntur 
angeli ut inordinata ibi in ordinem redigant; et cum ibi sunt, in tuto sunt; hoc intelligitur per quod qui in caelesti est, tutus sit inter omnes in infernis. @1 medio inferno; caeleste enim amoris,
