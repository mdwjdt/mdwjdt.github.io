<h4 align="center"></h4><p><strong>1571.</strong>“亚伯兰的牧人和罗得的牧人起了纷争”表内在人与外在人不一致。这从“牧人”的含义清楚可知，“牧人”是指那些施行教导的人，因而是指属敬拜的事物，这一点是人所共知的，故无需通过圣言证实这一点。这些话与前一节（13:5）被称为“帐棚”的事物有关，那里指出，这些事物表敬拜。紧接着第6节中的话则与第5节中被称为“牛群、羊群”的事物有关，那里也指出，这些事物是指所有物或获得物。由于这里论述的是敬拜，即内在人的敬拜和外在人的敬拜，并且这二者不再和谐一致，故经上在此说牧人之间“起了纷争”；因为亚伯兰代表内在人，罗得代表外在人。在敬拜中，内在人与外在人之间这种不一致的整个性质和品质能被识别出来，甚至在敬拜的每个细节中被识别出来。因为在敬拜中，当内在人想要视神之国为目的，外在人想要视这个世界为目的时，分歧就会由此产生。这种分歧就体现在敬拜中，事实上十分明显，以至于在天堂，哪怕最小的分歧都能被注意到。这就是“亚伯兰的牧人和罗得的牧人起了纷争”所表之义。还有一个附加原因，即“那时，迦南人与比利洗人住在那地”。</p><br />

<p><strong>[NCE]1571.</strong> There was controversy between the herders of Abram's livestock and the herders of Lot's livestock means that his inner self and his outer did not agree. This can be seen from the symbolism of livestock herders as people who teach and consequently as elements of worship, as anyone can recognize.{*1} As a result, there is no need to take time proving it from the Word.<br />This clause looks back to the things called "tents" above in verse <a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_1571/bible_king-james-version_genesis_13_5" target=_top>5</a>, which symbolize worship, as pointed out there [搂<a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_1571/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_1566" target=_top>1566</a>]. The words of the last verse, verse <a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_1571/bible_king-james-version_genesis_13_6" target=_top>6</a>, allude to the things called "flock and herd" in verse <a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_1571/bible_king-james-version_genesis_13_5" target=_top>5</a>, which are possessions, or "gain," as also pointed out there [搂<a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_1571/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_1565" target=_top>1565</a>].<br />Because the subject here is worship, specifically the worship of the Lord's inner self and that of his outer self, and because these did not harmonize yet, the present verse says that there was controversy between the herders. Abram represents his inner self and Lot his outer self.<br />Worship especially, and in fact each individual aspect of worship, reveals the existence and nature of any variance between our inner and outer selves. When our inner self wants to focus on the purposes of God's kingdom in its worship, and our outer self wants to focus on the world's purposes, dissension arises and reveals itself in our worship. In fact even the smallest disagreement is noticed in heaven.<br />These are the concepts symbolized by the friction between the herders of Abram's livestock and the herders of Lot's livestock.<br />The reason is also added: that the Canaanite and the Perizzite were present in the land.<br /><br /><strong>Footnotes:</strong><br />{*1} "People who teach" are apparently here understood to be people who teach doctrine, or elements of worship; thus the ready shift in symbolism from the teacher to the subject taught. The connection between these concepts is clearer in the Latin: the Latin word for "herder" is pastor, a term applied in Swedenborg's day to a rector, or head of a religious school or college (see <a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_1571/swedenborg_true-christian-religion-chadwick_106" target=_top>True Christianity 106</a>).

There was strife between the herdmen of Abram's cattle and the herdmen of Lot's cattle. That this signifies that the internal man and the external did not agree, is evident from the signification of 
the "herdmen [or shepherds-pastores] of cattle," as being those who teach, and thus things that are of worship, as may be known to everyone; it is therefore unnecessary to confirm this from the Word. 
These things relate to what were called "tents" in the preceding verse 5; and it was there pointed out that these signify worship. What is said in verse 6, that immediately precedes these words, relates 
to what were called "flock and herd" in verse 5; and in the consideration of that verse it was also pointed out that these denote possessions or acquisitions. As worship is here treated of, namely, 
that of the internal man and of the external, and as these did not yet agree, it is here said that "there was strife between the herdmen;" for Abram represents the internal man, and Lot the external. 
In worship the nature and quality of the disagreement between the internal man and the external are especially discernible, and this even in every single thing of worship; for when in worship the internal 
man desires to regard the ends that belong to the kingdom of God, and the external man desires to regard the ends that belong to the world, there thus arises a disagreement which manifests itself 
in the worship, and that so plainly that the smallest bit of such disagreement is noticed in heaven. This is what is signified by the "strife between the herdmen of Abram's cattle and the herdmen of 
Lot's cattle." The cause is also subjoined, namely, that "the Canaanite and the Perizzite were then dwelling in the land." </p>

That 'there was strife between Abram's herdsmen and Lot's herdsmen' means that the internal man and the external did not agree is clear from the meaning of 'herdsmen'<A name="fntext1"></a><A href="#fn1"><sup>a</sup></a> as those who teach, and so things 
that are connected with worship, as everyone may well know, and therefore there is no need to pause and confirm these matters from the Word. These words have regard to the things called 'tents' in 
verse 5 above, which, as pointed out there, mean worship. The words used in the following verse 6 have regard to things called 'flocks and cattle' in verse 5, which are possessions or acquisitions, as 
was also pointed out there. Because worship is the subject here, namely that of the Internal Man and of the external Man, it is said here, since the two were no longer in agreement, that 'there was strife 
between the herdsman'; for 'Abram' represents the internal man and 'Lot' the external man. It is above all in worship that one can recognize the whole nature of any disagreement that exists between 
the internal man and the external man; indeed it can be recognized in every detail of worship. When the internal man wishes to make the kingdom of God his ends in view and the external wishes to make 
the world his, there is consequently a divergence which shows itself in worship, and indeed so plainly that even the slightest divergence is noticed in heaven. These are the considerations meant by 
'strife between Abram's herdsmen and Lot's herdsman'. And the reason is added, namely that 'the Canaanite and the Perizzite were then in the land'.

Quod 'fuit lis inter pastores pecoris Abrami, et inter pastores pecoris Loti' significet quod internus homo et externus non concordarent, constat a significatione 'pastorum pecoris' quod sint qui docent, 
ita quae cultus sunt, sicut cuivis notum esse potest; quare illis confirmandis e Verbo non immorandum: haec spectant illa quae in vers. praec. 5 dicta sunt 'tentoria,' quae quod significent cultum, 
ibi indicatum est; quae dicuntur in vers. mox praec. 6, spectant illa quae vers. 5 dicta sunt 'grex et armentum,' quae quod sint possessiones seu acquisitiones, etiam ibi indicatum est: hic quoniam 
agitur de cultu nempe Interni hominis et Externi, qui quia nondum concordarunt, hic dicitur quod 'lis fuit inter pastores,' 'Abram' enim repraesentat internum hominem et 'Lotus' externum: in cultu imprimis 
noscitur quae et qualis discrepantia est inter hominem internum et externum, immo in singulis cultus, in quo cum internus homo vult spectare fines regni Dei et externus vult spectare fines mundi, 
inde discrepantia quae in cultu se manifestat, et quidem in tantum ut discrepantiae minimum animadvertatur in caelo. Haec sunt quae significantur per 'litem inter pastores pecoris Abrami, et pastores 
pecoris Loti': causa quoque adjungitur, nempe quod 'Canaanita et Perizzita esset in terra.' </p>
