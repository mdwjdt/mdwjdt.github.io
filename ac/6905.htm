<h3 align="center" class="ired">属天的奥秘 第6905节</h3>
<h4 align="center"></h4><p><strong>6905.</strong>“为要祭祀耶和华我们的神”表因此对主的敬拜。这从“祭祀”的含义清楚可知，“祭祀”是指总体上的敬拜（参看<a href="923.htm">923</a>节）；因为在希伯来教会，以及后来在雅各的后代当中，一切敬拜都涉及祭祀，这一点可从以下事实看出来：他们天天献祭，每逢节期多次献祭；当人们被允许行使祭司职分，或经历洁净时，他们也会献祭；还有赎罪祭，赎愆祭，以及还愿祭，甘心祭。这一切证明，“祭祀”表示总体上的敬拜。“祭祀耶和华神”就表示对主的敬拜，这一点从以下事实很明显地看出来：祭祀只代表主和来自祂的神性属天和属灵事物（参看<a href="1823.htm">1823</a>，<a href="2180.htm">2180</a>，<a href="2805.htm">2805</a>，<a href="2807.htm">2807</a>，<a href="2830.htm">2830</a>，<a href="3519.htm">3519</a>节），并不代表其它任何东西；还有，在圣言中，“耶和华神”只表示主，并不表示其他人（参看<a href="6903.htm">6903</a>节）；“耶和华”表示祂的神性存在，“神”表示来自那神性存在的神性彰显；因此，“耶和华”表示祂的神性之爱的神性良善，“神”表示从祂的神性良善发出的神性真理。</p>

That we may sacrifice to Jehovah our God. That this signifies thus the worship of the Lord, is evident from the signification of "sacrificing," as being worship in general (see n. 923); for in the Hebrew 
church, and afterward with the posterity of Jacob, all worship had reference to sacrifices, as can be seen from the fact that they were offered daily, and many at every festival; also at inaugurations, 
at purifications, for sins, for guilt, besides in consequence of vows, and of free-will. Hence it is that by "sacrifices" is signified worship in general. That it is the worship of the Lord which 
is signified by "sacrificing to Jehovah God," is very evident from the fact that sacrifices represented none other than the Lord, and the Divine celestial and spiritual things which are from Him (see 
n. 1823, 2180, 2805, 2807, 2830, 3519); and also from the fact that by "Jehovah God" in the Word none other than the Lord is meant (see n. 6903); by "Jehovah" His Divine Being, and by "God" the Divine 
Coming-forth thence derived; thus by "Jehovah" the Divine good of His Divine love, and by "God" the Divine truth proceeding from His Divine good. </p>

'And let us sacrifice to Jehovah our God' means thus the worship of the Lord. This is clear from the meaning of 'sacrificing' as worship in general, dealt with in <a href="923.htm">923</a>, for in the Hebrew Church and subsequently 
among the descendants of Jacob all worship was linked to sacrifices. This may be recognized from the fact that sacrifices were offered daily, and many at every feast. They were also offered 
when people were to be admitted into priestly functions or were to undergo purification; and there were sin-offerings and guilt-offerings, as well as those made as a consequence of vows, and those that 
were free-will offerings. All this goes to prove that worship in general is meant by 'sacrifices'. As regards its being the worship of the Lord that is meant by 'sacrificing to Jehovah God', this is 
plainly evident from the consideration that the sacrifices did not represent anything other than the Lord and the Divine celestial and spiritual realities that derive from Him, <a href="1827.htm">1827</a>, <a href="2180.htm">2180</a>, <a href="2805.htm">2805</a>, <a href="2807.htm">2807</a>, <a href="2830.htm">2830</a>, <a href="3519.htm">3519</a>, and also from the consideration that in the Word none other than the Lord is meant by 'Jehovah God', see above in <a href="6903.htm">6903</a>. 'Jehovah' is used to mean His Divine Being, and 'God' to mean His 
Divine Coming-into-Being from that Divine Being, so that 'Jehovah' is used to mean the Divine Good of His Divine Love, and 'God' to mean the Divine Truth emanating from His Divine Good. </p>

`Et sacrificemus Jehovae Deo nostro': quod significet ita cultum Domini, constat ex significatione `sacrificare' quod sit cultus in communi, de qua n. 923, nam in Ecclesia Hebraea et postea apud posteros 
Jacobi omnis cultus se referebat ad sacrificia; quod constare potest ex eo quod quotidie facta sint, et quibusvis festis plura; tum cum inaugurarentur, cum purificarentur, pro peccatis, pro reatibus, 
praeter ex votis, et ex libero; inde est quod per `sacrificia' significetur cultus in genere; quod sit cultus Domini qui significatur per `sacrificare Jehovae Deo,' patet manifeste ex eo quod sacrificia 
non alium quam Dominum, (c)ac Divina caelestia et spiritualia quae ab Ipso, repraesentaverint, n. 1823, 2180, 2805, 2807, 2830, 3519; tum ex eo quod per `Jehovam Deum' in Verbo non alius quam 
Dominus intelligatur, videatur supra n. 6903; per Jehovam' Divinum Esse Ipsius, et per `Deum' inde Divinum Existere; ita per `Jehovam' Divinum Bonum Divini Amoris Ipsius et per `Deum' Divinum Verum procedens 
a Divino Ipsius Bono. </p>
