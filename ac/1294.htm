And they said, a man to his companion, "Come, let us make bricks and bake them until baked." And they had brick in place of stone, and tar they had in place of mortar.<br />And a man said to his companion means that it began. Come, let us make bricks, symbolizes the falsities that they would invent for themselves. And bake them until baked symbolizes evil rising out of self-love. And they had brick in place of stone means that they had falsity instead of truth. And tar they had in place of mortar means that they had the evil they craved, instead of goodness. </p>

Verse 3. And they said a man to his fellow, Come, let us make bricks, and let us burn them to a burning. And they had brick for stone, and bitumen had they for mortar. "And they said a man to his fellow," 
signifies that it was begun; "Come, let us make bricks," signifies falsities which they fashioned for themselves; "and let us burn them to a burning," signifies evils from the love of self. "And 
they had brick for stone," signifies that they had falsity instead of truth; "and bitumen had they for mortar," signifies that they had the evil of cupidity instead of good. </p>

Verse 3 And they said, one man to the next, Come, let us make bricks, and let us burn them thoroughly. And they had brick for stone, and they had bitumen for clay. </p>
<p>'And one man said to the next' means 
that this was started 'Come, let us make bricks' means the falsities which they fashioned for themselves. 'And let us burn them thoroughly' means the evils that stem from self-love. 'And they had 
brick for stone' means that they had falsity in place of truth. 'And they had bitumen for clay' means that they had evil springing from evil desire in place of good. </p>

</p><b>1294.</b>
Vers. 3.  Et dixerunt vir ad socium, Age, laterificemus lateres, et aduramus in adustum; et fuit iis later pro lapide, et bitumen fuit iis pro luto. 'Et dixit vir ad socium' significat quod coeptum: 
'age laterificemus lateres' significat falsa quae sibi fingerent: 'et aduramus in adustum' significat mala ex amore sui: 'et fiat iis later pro lapide' significat quod falsum iis esset pro vero: 'et 
bitumen fuit iis pro luto' significat quod malum cupiditatis pro bono. </p>
