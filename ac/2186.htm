<h3 align="center" class="ired">属天的奥秘 第2186节</h3>
<h4 align="center"></h4><p><strong>2186.</strong>“自己在树下站在他们面前”表随之而来的直觉。这从“树”的含义可推知，“树”是指直觉（参看<a href="103.htm">103</a>，<a href="2163.htm">2163</a>节）。前面经上说（18:4），来到亚伯拉罕面前的那三个人要在树下歇息歇息，这表示在主预备好自己后，神性要靠近主那时所在状态的直觉。而此处经上说，亚伯拉罕站在树下，这表示主预备好自己后便靠近神性直觉，这是一种相互行为。谁都能看出，提及那三个人，以及亚伯拉罕站在树下不是没有原因的，因此，这一细节因这些描述里面所隐藏的奥秘而被提及。</p>

<p align="center"><b>Potts(1905-1910) 2186</b></p><p><b>2186.</b>
And he stood before them under the tree. That this signifies the derivative perception, follows from the signification of a "tree," as being perception (see n. 103, 2163). It has been already stated 
(verse 4), that the three men who came to Abraham lay down under a tree, by which was signified that the Divine approached the perception of that state in which the Lord then was. But it is here said 
that Abraham stood under the tree, by which is signified that the Lord approached Divine perception, after He had prepared Himself; and this is the reciprocality. Everyone can see that it is not without 
a cause, that mention is made of the three men and of Abraham standing under a tree, consequently that it was said for the sake of the arcana which lie hidden in these things. </p>

<p align="center"><b>Elliott(1983-1999) 2186</b></p><p><b>2186.</b>
'And he stood before them under the tree' means consequent perception. This follows from the meaning of 'a tree' as perception, dealt with in <a href="103.htm">103</a>, <a href="2163.htm">2163</a>. Above in verse 4 it was stated that the three 
men who came to Abraham were to recline under the tree, which meant that the Divine was to draw near to the perception of that state which was the Lord's at that time. Here however it is said that Abraham 
stood under the tree, which means that the Lord drew near to the Divine perception after He had prepared Himself, which is a reciprocal action. Anyone may see that it is not without a reason that 
reference is made to the three men and to Abraham standing under the tree, and that therefore this detail was included because of the arcana that lie hidden within these descriptions. </p>

`Et ille stans ante illos sub arbore': quod significet perceptionem inde, sequitur ex significatione `arboris' quod sit perceptio, de qua n. 103, 2163; supra vers. 4 dictum quod `tres viri qui venerunt 
ad Abrahamum, incumberent sub arbore,' quibus significatum quod Divinum accederet ad perceptionem illius statu" in quo tunc fuit Dominus; hic autem dicitur quod `Abraham steterit sub arbore,' quo 
significatur quod Dominus accesserit ad perceptionem Divinam, postquam Se praeparaverit, quod reciprocum est; quisque videre potest quod non absque causa sit, quod dictum de tribus viris et de Abrahamo, 
quod `steterint sub arbore,' proinde quod dictum propter arcana illa quae in illis latent. </p>
