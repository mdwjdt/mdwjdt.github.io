<h3 align="center" class="ired">属天的奥秘 第7046节</h3>
<h4 align="center"></h4><p><strong>7046.</strong>“使它接触他的脚”表那时属世层的真实性质被展示出来。这从“接触”和“脚”的含义清楚可知：“接触”是指展示，因为一个事物通过接触被展示；“脚”是指属世层（参看<a href="2162.htm">2162</a>，<a href="3147.htm">3147</a>，<a href="3761.htm">3761</a>，<a href="3986.htm">3986</a>，<a href="4280.htm">4280</a>，<a href="4938.htm">4938</a>-<a href="4952.htm">4952</a>节）。展示属世层的实际性质就是展示这个民族的内在品质，他们的表面行为的外壳被除去后，内在品质就显现出来。世人的内层无法显现，直到他的外壳被除去。对恶人来说，他们的表面行为完全不同于他们的内在意愿和思维。因为人能假装高尚、公义，还能装出基督徒的良善或仁爱；这样做是为了叫人们相信他内心就是这个样。他因惧怕丧失利益、名声和地位，惧怕受到法律惩罚和丧失生命而被迫如此行。但当这些惧怕被除去，他的内在自我主宰他的行为时，他就会像个疯子一样掠夺别人的财物，渴望杀人、流人的血，连同胞也不放过，如内战中所发生的情形。人的内心就是这个样子，这一事实从来世的恶人看得更清楚，因为那时，外在从他们身上除去，内在暴露出来（参看<a href="7039.htm">7039</a>节），然后人们就会发现，许多在世上看似天使的人就是魔鬼。<br />内在与外在之间的这种巨大反差表明人的状态完全败坏了。因为对一个诚实、公义和良善的人来说，这样的反差并不存在；他怎么想就怎么说，怎么说就怎么想。但对那些不诚实、不公义、不良善的人来说，情况就截然不同了；对他们来说，内在与外在之间就有一种反差。犹太民族就具有这种性质，如主在马太福音中以这些话所描述的：<br />你们这假冒为善的文士和法利赛人有祸了。因为你们洗净杯盘的外面，里面却盛满了勒索和放荡。你这瞎眼的法利赛人，先洗净杯盘的里面，好叫外面也干净了。你们这假冒为善的文士和法利赛人有祸了。因为你们好像粉饰的坟墓，外面好看，里面却装满了死人的骨头，和一切的污秽。你们也是如此，在人前，外面显出公义来，里面却装满了假善和不法的事。（马太福音<a href="http://39-27.cn/太23.25.htm">23:25</a>-<a href="http://39-27.cn/太23.28.htm">28</a>）</p>

And made it touch his feet. That this signifies that the quality of the natural was then shown, is evident from the signification of "making it touch," as being to show, for a thing is shown by the touch; 
and from the signification of the "feet," as being the natural (see n. 2162, 3147, 3761, 3986, 4280, 4938-4952). By the quality of the natural being shown, is meant the quality of that nation interiorly, 
which appears when the exterior is removed. The interior with man in the world cannot appear until the exterior has been removed; because with the evil the exterior acts quite differently from 
what the interior wills and thinks; for the man feigns what is honorable, what is just, and also Christian good or charity; and this in order that it may be believed that he is such inwardly. He is 
compelled so to act by fears of the loss of gain, of reputation, and of honor, and fears of the penalties of the law and of the loss of life. But when these fears have been removed, and he acts from 
his interior, then like a madman he plunders another's property, and breathes the destruction and death even of his fellow-citizens, as is the case in civil wars. That the interiors are such is still 
more manifest from the evil in the other life, for the externals are then taken away from them, and the internals are laid bare (see n. 7039), and then it is discovered that many who in the world have 
appeared as angels, are devils.  [2] This great disagreement between the interiors and exteriors is an indication that the state of man has been utterly perverted; for such a disagreement has no existence 
with a man who is in what is sincere, just, and good; he speaks as he thinks, and thinks as he speaks. But it is far otherwise with those who are not in what is sincere, not in what is just, and 
not in what is good; with these the interiors disagree with the exteriors. That the Jewish nation was of this character is described by the Lord in Matthew in these words: </p>
<p>     Woe unto you, scribes 
and Pharisees, hypocrites! For ye make clean the outside of the cup and of the platter, but within they are full of robbery and intemperance. Thou blind Pharisee, cleanse first the inside of the cup 
and of the platter, that the outside may be clean also. Woe unto you, scribes and Pharisees, hypocrites! For ye make yourselves like unto whited sepulchers, which outwardly indeed appear beautiful, but 
inwardly are full of dead men's bones, and of all uncleanness. Even so ye also outwardly appear righteous unto men, but inwardly ye are full of hypocrisy and iniquity (Matt. 23:25-28). </p>

'And caused it to touch his feet' means a demonstration of the actual nature of the natural then. This is clear from the meaning of 'causing to touch' as demonstrating, for a thing can be demonstrated 
by means of the sense of touch; and from the meaning of 'feet' as the natural, dealt with in <a href="2162.htm">2162</a>, <a href="3147.htm">3147</a>, <a href="3761.htm">3761</a>, <a href="3986.htm">3986</a>, <a href="4280.htm">4280</a>, <a href="4938.htm">4938</a>-<a href="4951.htm">4951</a>. A demonstration of the actual nature of the natural means a demonstration 
of the inner character of that nation, which can be seen when the shell of their outward behaviour is removed. What is within a person in the world cannot be seen until his shell is removed. 
In the case of the evil their outward actions are altogether different from their inner will and thought. For a person can give an impression of being honourable; he can give an impression of being righteous, 
and also of being governed by Christian good, which is charity - so effectively that people think he is like that inwardly. He is also driven to do this by fear that he may suffer the loss of 
gain, reputation, and position, be subject to punishments under the law, or suffer loss of life. But when such fears have been removed and his inner self governs his actions, then like a madman he plunders 
another person's goods, and lusts for murder and blood, even of fellow citizens, as happens in civil wars. The fact that a person can be like this inwardly may be seen still more plainly in the 
wicked in the next life, since externals are removed from them and internals laid bare, regarding which see <a href="7039.htm">7039</a>. That removal reveals that very many who seemed to be like angels in the world are devils. </p>

<p><b>[2]</b>
This great discrepancy between what exists inwardly and what exists outwardly is a sign that a person is entirely perverted. With him who has honesty, righteousness, and goodness within him 
no such discrepancy exists; he speaks as he thinks, and thinks as he speaks. It is altogether different with those who have no honesty, righteousness, or goodness within them. With them there is a 
discrepancy between interiors and exteriors. That is what the Jewish nation was like, as described by the Lord in these words in Matthew, </p>
<blockquote>
Woe to you, scribes and Pharisees, hypocrites! For you cleanse 
the exterior of the cup and the plate but the interiors are full of pillage and lack of restraint. Blind Pharisee! cleanse first the interior of the cup and the plate, in order that the exterior may 
be made clean also. Woe to you, scribes and Pharisees, hypocrites! For you make yourselves like white-washed sepulchres, which outwardly do indeed appear beautiful, but within are full of dead people's 
bones and of all uncleanness. So too do you outwardly appear righteous to men (homo) but inwardly you are full of hypocrisy and iniquity. <a href="http://bible.gospelcom.net/cgi-bin/bible?passage=Matt%2013:25-28&amp;version=ESV&amp;interface=print&amp;showfn=yes&amp;showxref">Matt 13:25-28</a>.

`Et tangere fecit pedes ejus':  quod significet quod ostensum quale tunc naturale, constat ex significatione `tangere facere' quod sit ostendere, nam per tactum ostenditur; et ex significatione `pedum' 
quod sit naturale, de qua n. 2162, 3147, 3761, 3986, 4280, 4938-4952.  Per quod ostensum quale sit naturale, intelligitur qualis gens illa interius esset, quod apparet quando exterius removetur; interius 
apud hominem in mundo non potest apparere priusquam remotum est exterius; exterius enim apud malos prorsus aliter agit quam interius vult et cogitat, {1}fingit enim homo honestum, fingit justum, 
et quoque bonum Christianum seu charitatem, et hoc ut credatur quod interius talis sit, ad sic faciendum etiam adigunt timores' jacturae lucri, famae et honoris, poenarum legis, (c)et vitae; {2}at 
cum timores illi remoti sunt, {3}et is agit ex interiore suo, {4}tunc sicut vesanus alterius bona depraedatur, {5}ac necem et sanguinem {6}, etiam concivium, spirat, ut fit in bellis intestinis; quod 
interiora talia sint, patet adhuc manifestius a malis in altera vita, ab illis enim {7}externa auferuntur, et {8}interna nudantur, de qua re videatur n. 7039, et tunc {9}detegitur quod plures qui ut angeli 
apparuerunt in mundo sint diaboli. 	2 Quod interiora tantum dissideant ab exterioribus, indicium est quod status hominis prorsus perversus sit; apud illum qui in sincero est, in justo, et in bono 
{10}, talis dissidentia non datur; is loquitur sicut cogitat, et cogitat sicut loquitur; aliter prorsus apud illos qui non in sincero sunt, non in justo, et non in bono; apud illos dissident interiora 
ab exterioribus;' quod {11}gens Judaica talis fuerit, describitur his verbis {12}a Domino apud Matthaeum, Vae vobis, scribae et Pharisaei, hypocritae! quia purgatis exterius poculi et patinae, interiora 
vero plena sunt rapina et intemperantia.  Pharisaee caece! purga prius interius poculi et patinae, ut fiat etiam exterius mundum.  Vae vobis, scribae et Pharisaei, hypocritae! quia similes vos 
facitis sepulcris dealbatis, quae foris quidem apparent pulchra, intus vero plena sunt ossibus mortuorum, et omni immunditie; sic etiam vos foris apparetis hominibus justi, intus vero pleni estis hypocrisi 
et iniquitate, xxiii 25-28. 	1 et hoc ob timoribus 	2 sed 	3 agitur tunc 	4 et 	5 et non nisi quam neces 	6 i cupit 	7 exteriora 	8 et nudantur interiora, ut fit in altera vita 	9 patet 	10 
i est 	11 talis apud gentem Judaicam 	12 Before describitur </p>
