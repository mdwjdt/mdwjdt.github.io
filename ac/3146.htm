<h3 align="center" class="ired">属天的奥秘 第3146节</h3>
<h4 align="center"></h4><p><strong>3146.</strong>“给了骆驼粮草和饲料”表在真理和良善上的教导。这从“粮草”和“饲料”的含义清楚可知：“粮草”是指属世人中的真理；“饲料”是指属世人中的良善（参看<a href="3114.htm">3114</a>节）。由于“粮草”和“饲料”表示这些事物，故可知“给了粮草和饲料”是指在真理和良善上给予教导。自由的目的是这样：因着拥有对真理的情感，并在这情感的推动下，人有可能以这种方式接受教导，以便真理深深植入在他里面，即植入在属灵人和灵魂里面，在那里与良善联结。这一点从前面有关自由的论述（<a href="2870.htm">2870</a>-<a href="2893.htm">2893</a>节）可以看出来。<br />这就是信，或真理，就是信之真理扎根的方式。信之真理若不在理性中与良善联结，就永远接受不到任何生命，也结不出任何果实。因为凡被称为信之果实的，都是爱与仁之善通过信之真理所结的果实。除非属灵之热，就是爱之良善，通过属灵之光作工，否则，人就像冻硬的土地，如同冬天那样，万物不生长，更不会结出果实。因为正如光没有热产不出任何东西，同样，没有爱的信也产不出任何东西。</p>

<p align="center"><b>Potts(1905-1910) 3146</b></p><p><b>3146.</b>
And he gave straw and provender for the camels. That this signifies instruction in truths and goods, is evident from the signification of "straw," as being the truths of the natural man, and from the 
signification of "provender" as being the goods therein (concerning which see above, n. 3114). Because these things are signified by "straw and provender," it follows that to "give straw and provender" 
is to instruct in truths and goods. That freedom is for the sake of these things, namely, that man may be instructed in the affection and from the affection of truth, and thus that truths may be insinuated 
even to the spiritual man, or even to the soul, and may there be conjoined with good, may be seen from what was shown above concerning freedom (n. 2870-2893). Such is the inrooting of faith, 
or of the truth which is of faith, that unless it is coupled with good in the rational, the truth of faith never receives any life, nor does any fruit come from it; for all that which is called the fruit 
of faith, is the fruit of the good of love and charity through the truth of faith. Unless spiritual heat, which is the good of love, operated by spiritual light, which is the truth of faith, the man 
would be as ground hard frozen as in winter time, when nothing grows, still less bears fruit. For as light without heat produces nothing, so faith produces nothing without love. </p>

<p align="center"><b>Elliott(1983-1999) 3146</b></p><p><b>3146.</b>
'And gave straw and fodder to the camels' means instruction in truths and goods. This is clear from the meaning of 'straw' as the truths present in the natural man, and from the meaning of 'fodder' as 
the goods there, dealt with above in <a href="3114.htm">3114</a>. Since these things are meant by 'straw and fodder' it therefore follows that 'giving straw and fodder' is giving instruction in truths and goods. The purpose 
of that freedom is this: Possessing the affection for truth and being stirred by that affection, a person may become instructed in such a way that truths are implanted deep within him - within the 
spiritual man or the soul - where they are joined to good, as may be seen from what has been shown regarding freedom in <a href="2870.htm">2870</a>-<a href="2893.htm">2893</a>. </p>
<p></p>
<p><b>[2]</b>
 This is the way in which faith - that is, truth which is the truth 
of faith made to take root; and unless it is coupled to good in the rational the truth of faith never receives any life, nor does any fruit develop from it. For everything called the fruit of faith 
is the fruit of that good which is the good of love and charity coming by way of truth which is the truth of faith. Unless spiritual warmth, which is the good of love, is actively present in spiritual 
light, which is the truth of faith, man would be like ground frozen stiff, as in wintertime, when nothing grows, let alone bears any fruit. For just as light devoid of warmth is totally unproductive, 
so is faith devoid of love. </p>

<p align="center"><b>Latin(1748-1756) 3146</b>
</p><b>3146.</b>
`Et dedit stramen et pabulum camelis': quod significet instructionem in veris et bonis, constat ex significatione `straminis' quod sint vera naturalis hominis, et ex significatione `pabuli' quod sint 
bona ibi, de quibus supra n. 3114; quia illa per stramen et pabulum significantur, inde sequitur quod `dare stramen et pabulum' sit instruere in veris et bonis. Quod liberum sit propterea, ut in affectione 
et ex affectione veri instruatur homo, et sic alte usque ad spiritualem hominem, seu usque ad animam insinuentur vera, ac ibi conjungantur bono, videri potest ex illis quae de libero n. 2870-2893 
ostensa sunt; [2] talis est radicatio fidei, seu veri quod est fidei, quod nisi copuletur cum bono in rationali, nusquam verum fidei accipit aliquam vitam, nec fit aliquis fructus inde; nam omne quod 
vocatur fructus fidei, est fructus boni quod est amoris et charitatis per verum quod est fidei; nisi calor spiritualis qui est bonum amoris, (x)operetur per lucem spiritualem, quae est verum fidei, 
homo foret sicut humus gelu constricta, ut tempore hiemis, quo nihil crescit, minus fructificatur; sicut enim lux absque calore nihil producit, ita fides nihil absque amore. </p>
