<h3 align="center" class="ired">属天的奥秘 第1387节</h3>
<h4 align="center"></h4><p><strong>1387.</strong>我曾数次向那些在来世的人谈论直觉，他们在世时自认能洞悉和明了一切。我告诉他们，天使能直觉自己通过主思维、言谈、意愿和行动；但他们仍想象不出直觉是什么，因为他们认为，若一切皆以这种方式从主流入，那他们就会失去一切生命；在这种情况下，他们不会通过自己，或其自我思考什么（而他们的生命就在于此），因而成了别人在思考，而不是他们自己，以致他们纯粹是没有生命的器官。但他们被告知，有直觉的生命和无直觉的生命之别犹如黑暗和光明之别；人们只有在接受这直觉后，才首次开始感觉活着，因为这时，他们通过主活着，然而也会有一个自我，这个自我连同一切幸福快乐都被赋予他们。他们还通过大量经验被展示何为真正的直觉，当时他们承认直觉的存在；但过了一会儿，他们又不承认了，并质疑和否认它的存在。这清楚表明理解何为直觉对人来说何等困难。</p>

<p><strong>[NCE]1387.</strong> Several times I have talked about perception with people in the next life who while they were living in the world had imagined they could investigate and understand any subject. "Angels," I said, "perceive that they think and speak and that they will and act from the Lord."<br />The people I was talking to, though, could not comprehend what perception was. They thought that if everything were the result of outside influence like this, it would rob them completely of life, because it would mean never thinking for themselves, never thinking independently — which for them was life. It would mean that someone else was thinking for them and not they themselves. So they would be mere instruments, devoid of life.<br />"The difference in quality of life between having perception and not having it," I pointed out, "is like night and day. You first start to live your own life when you receive this perception, because you then live from the Lord. You then enjoy a sense of individuality as well, which comes to you replete with every happiness and joy."<br />From plentiful experience, I also illustrated for them how perception works, and they then acknowledged that it was possible. After a while, though, they again forgot, doubted, and denied. This showed me how hard it is for people to grasp what perception is. </p>

I have several times conversed about perception with those in the other life who, while they lived in the world, had regarded themselves as able to penetrate and understand all things; telling them that 
angels perceive that they think and speak, and will and act from the Lord. But still they could not conceive what perception is, but supposed that if all things were to inflow in this way, they would 
be bereaved of all life; because in that case they would think nothing from themselves, or from what is their own; and in this they had made life to consist; and that in that case it would be another 
who was thinking, and not themselves; so that they would be mere organs devoid of life. But they were told that between having perception, and not having it, the difference of life is like that between 
light and darkness; and that men first begin to feel alive when they receive such perception; for then they live from the Lord, and also have what is their own, which is given together with all 
happiness and delight. It was also shown them by varied experience how the case is with perception, and at the time they acknowledged the possibility of it; but after a while they again did not know, 
doubted, and denied. From this it has been made evident how difficult it is for man to comprehend what perception is. </p>

I have spoken on several occasions about perception to those in the next life who, while they lived in the world, imagined that they had the ability to see into and understand all things. I told them 
that angels perceive that they think and speak, will and act, from the Lord; but they were still unable to envisage what perception was, for they imagined that if all things flowed in from Him in that 
way they would be bereft of all life. They would be bereft of it because they would not think anything from themselves or from their proprium - in which activity they made life consist - and so it would 
be another who did the thinking and not they themselves, so that they would be organs without any life in them. They were told however that so far as life is concerned the difference between having 
perception and not having it is like the difference between darkness and light, and that people first begin to feel alive when they are receiving such perception, for in that case they live from the 
Lord yet also have a proprium, which is imparted to them together with every happiness and delight. They were also shown from much experience what perception really was, during which time they acknowledged 
the existence of it. But after a while they again had no knowledge of it, and doubted and denied its existence. This made clear how difficult it is for man to grasp what perception is. </p>

<p align="center"><b>Latin(1748-1756) 1387</b>
</p><b>1387.</b>
Locutus sum aliquoties de perceptione cum illis in altera vita qui dum vixerunt in mundo, putaverunt se omnia potuisse penetrare et intelligere, quod angeli percipiant, quod cogitent et loquantur, velint 
et agant a Domino; sed usque non potuerunt concipere quid perceptio, putantes, si influerent omnia ita, quod sic orbarentur omni vita; quia nihil ex semet aut proprio sic cogitarent, in quo posuerunt 
vitam, et quod sic alius esset qui cogitaret, et illi non, ita quod forent organa nullius vitae; sed illis dictum quod talis vitae differentia sit inter habere perceptionem et non habere qualis est 
inter tenebras et lucem; et quod tunc primum sibi vivant cum talem perceptionem accipiunt, nam vivunt tunc a Domino, habentes quoque proprium, quod illis datur cum omni felici et jucundo: illis quoque 
ostensum est pluri experientia quomodo se habeat cum perceptione, et tunc agnoverunt quod dabilis, sed post aliquam temporis moram iterum nesciverunt, dubitarunt, et negaverunt; exinde constare potuit 
quam aegre homo capere possit quid perceptio. </p>
