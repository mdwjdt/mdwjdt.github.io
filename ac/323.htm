<p><strong>[NCE]323.</strong> Below, at the end of the chapter, are some examples of people who thought otherwise in the life of the body [<a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_323/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_443" target=_top>443-448</a>]. </p>

At the end of the chapter, several examples will be given of those who during their abode in this world had thought otherwise. </p>
<p>     CHAPTER 4      1. And the man knew Eve his wife, and she conceived, 
and bare Cain, and said, I have gotten a man [vir], Jehovah.      2. And she added to bear his brother Abel; and Abel was a shepherd of the flock, and Cain was a tiller of the ground.      3. And 
at the end of days it came to pass that Cain brought of the fruit of the ground an offering to Jehovah.      4. And Abel, he also brought of the firstlings of his flock, and of the fat thereof. And 
Jehovah looked to Abel, and to his offering: </p>
<p>     5. And unto Cain and unto his offering He looked not, and Cain's anger was kindled exceedingly, and his faces fell.      6. And Jehovah said unto 
Cain, Why art thou wroth? and why are thy faces fallen?      7. If thou doest well, art thou not exalted? and if thou doest not well, sin lieth at the door; and to thee is his desire, and thou rulest 
over him.      8. And Cain talked to Abel his brother; and it came to pass when they were in the field, that Cain rose up against Abel his brother, and slew him.      9. And Jehovah said to Cain, Where 
is Abel thy brother? And he said, I know not, am I my brother's keeper?      10. And He said, What hast thou done? the voice of thy brother's bloods crieth to Me from the ground.      11. And now 
art thou cursed from the ground, which hath opened its mouth to receive thy brother's bloods from thy hand.      12. When thou tillest the ground, it shall not henceforth yield unto thee its strength; 
a fugitive and a wanderer shalt thou be in the earth.      13. And Cain said unto Jehovah, Mine iniquity is greater than can be taken away.      14. Behold, Thou hast cast me out this day from 
the faces of the ground; and from Thy faces shall I be hid, and I shall be a fugitive and a wanderer in the earth; and it shall come to pass that everyone that findeth me shall slay me.      15. And 
Jehovah said unto him, Therefore whosoever slayeth Cain, vengeance shall be taken on him sevenfold. And Jehovah set a mark upon Cain, lest any finding him should smite him.      16. And Cain went out 
from the faces of Jehovah, and dwelt in the land of Nod, toward the east of Eden.      17. And Cain knew his wife, and she conceived and bare Enoch; and he was building a city, and called the name of 
the city after the name of his son, Enoch.      18. And unto Enoch was born Irad; and Irad begat Mehujael; and Mehujael begat Methusael; and Methusael begat Lamech.      19. And Lamech took unto him 
two wives; the name of the one was Adah, and the name of the other Zillah.      20. And Adah bare Jabal; he was the father of the dweller in tents, and of cattle.      21. And his brother's name 
was Jubal; he was the father of everyone that playeth upon the harp and organ.      22. And Zillah, she also bare Tubal-Cain, an instructor of every artificer in brass and iron; and the sister of Tubal-Cain 
was Naamah.      23. And Lamech said unto his wives, Adah and Zillah, Hear my voice, ye wives of Lamech, and with your ears perceive my speech, for I have slain a man to my wounding, and a little 
one to my hurt.      24. If Cain shall be avenged sevenfold, truly Lamech seventy and sevenfold.      25. And the man knew his wife again, and she bare a son, and called his name Seth; for God 
hath appointed me another seed instead of Abel; for Cain slew him.      26. And to Seth, to him also there was born a son; and he called his name Enosh: then began they to call upon the name of Jehovah. </p>

Sequuntur ad finem capitis quaedam exempla de iis qui aliter in vita corporis cogitarunt. </p>
<p>CAPUT IV 	1.  ET homo cognovit Havam uxorem suam, et concepit e peperit Cain; et dixit, Acquisivi virum, 
Jehovam. 	2.  Et addidit parere fratrem ejus, Habel; et fuit Habel pastor gregis, et Cain fuit colens humum. 	3.  Et factum a fine dierum, et attulit Cain de fructu humi munus JEHOVAE. 	4.  Et Habel 
attulit etiam ille de primogenitis gregis sui, et de pinguedine eorum: et aspexit JEHOVAH ad Habel et ad munus illius.      5.  Et ad Cain et ad munus ejus non aspexit; et accensa est ira Caino valde, 
et ceciderunt facies ejus. 	6.  Et dixit JEHOVAH ad Cain, Quare accensa est ira tibi? et quare ceciderunt facies tuae? 	7.  Annon si benefacis, elevatio? et si non benefacis, ad januam peccatum 
cubans; et ad te desiderium ejus, et tu dominaris ei. 	8.  Et dixit Cain ad Habel, fratrem suum: et erat, cum essent in agro, et surrexit Cain contra Habel fratrem suum, et occidit illum. 	9.  Et dixit 
JEHOVAH ad Cain, Ubi Habel frater tuus? et dixit Non scio, an custos fratris mei ego? 	10.  Et dixit, Quid fecisti? Vox sanguinum fratris tui clamantium ad Me ex humo. 	11.  Et nunc, maledictus 
tu de humo, quae aperuit os suum, accipiens sanguines fratris tui e manu tua. 	12.  Cum coles humum, non addet dare vim suam tibi, vagus et profugus eris in terra. 	13.  Et dixit Cain ad JEHOVAM, Major 
iniquitas mea, quam ut auferatur. 	14.  Ecce ejecisti me hodie desuper faciebus humi; et a faciebus Tuis abscondar, et ero vagus et profugus in terra; et erit omnis inveniens me, occidat me. 	15. 
 Et dixit ei JEHOVAH, Quapropter omnis occidens Cain septempliciter vindicabitur; et posuit JEHOVAH Caino signum, ut non percuteret eum quisquam inveniens eum. 	16.  Et exivit Cain a faciebus JEHOVAE; 
et habitavit in terra Nod versus orientem Edenis. 	17.  Et cognovit Cain uxorem suam, et concepit, et peperit Hanoch; et fuit aedificans urbem, et vocavit nomen urbis secundum nomen filii sui Hanoch. 	18. 
 Et natus Hanocho, Iradum; et Irad genuit Mehujael; et Mehujael genuit Methushael; et Methushael genuit Lamech. 	19.  Et accepit sibi Lamech duas uxores; nomen unius Adah, et nomen alterius 
Zillah. 	20.  Et peperit Adah Jabal, is erat pater habitantis tentorium, et pecoris. 	21.  Et nomen fratris ejus Jubal, is erat pater omnis pulsantis citharam et organum. 	22.  Et Zillah etiam ea 
peperit Tubal-cain, erudiens omnem artificem aeris et ferri. Et soror Tubal-cain Naamah. 	23.  Et dixit Lamech uxoribus suis Adah et Zillah, Audite vocem meam uxores Lamechi, et auribus percipite dictum 
meum, quod virum occidi in vulnus meum, et parvulum in livorem meum. 	24.  Quod septempliciter vindicabitur Cain, et Lamech septuagies et septies. 	25.  Et cognovit homo adhuc uxorem suam, et 
peperit filium, et vocavit nomen ejus Sheth; quia reposuit mihi Deus semen aliud loco Habelis, quod occiderit illum Cain. 	26.  Et Shetho etiam illi natus est filius, et vocavit nomen ejus Enosh: tunc 
coeptum est invocare nomen JEHOVAE. </p>
