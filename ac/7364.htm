<h3 align="center" class="ired">属天的奥秘 第7364节</h3>
<h4 align="center"></h4><p><strong>7364.</strong>在他们的社群，那些开始思考错误的东西，并由此意愿错误东西的人就会从他们的社群被逐出，独自离开。因此，他们在所有社群之外过着极其悲惨的生活，就住在岩石当中或其它地方，因为他们的社群不再照料他们。一些社群尝试各种方式迫使这种人幡然悔悟；当这一切证明是徒劳无功时，他们就切断了与这些人的联系。他们以这种方式未雨绸缪，防止统治欲和物欲潜入；也就是说，防止有人出于统治欲掌控他们所在的社群，之后掌控其它社群；还防止有人出于物欲掠夺他人的财物。在火星，人人都满足于自己的财物，人人都满足于自己因公义和爱邻所受到的尊敬。如果那些思想并意愿邪恶的人没有被赶出去，如果他们没有果断而坚决地抵制存在于任何人身上的爱自己爱世界的萌芽，那么心灵的这种快乐和平安就会被摧毁。因为这些爱就是造成社群变为帝国和王国的原因，在这些帝国和王国中，很少有人不想去发号施令，行使控制，并占有他人的一切财产。因为很少有人出于公义、公平而行公义、公平；更很少有人了出于仁而行良善，出于信而行真理。相反，做这些事都是出于害怕法律，受到诅咒或伤害，害怕丧失生命、利益和地位，丧失这些东西所带来的名声。</p>

<p align="center"><b>Potts(1905-1910) 7364</b></p><p><b>7364.</b>
Those in their societies who begin to think wrongly, and thence to will wrongly, are separated, and left to themselves alone, whence they lead a most wretched life out of all society, in rocks or other 
places, for they are no longer cared for by the rest. Certain societies endeavor to drive such persons to repentance by various methods; but when this fails, they separate themselves from them. In 
this way they take care lest the lust of dominion and of gain should creep in, that is, lest any from the lust of dominion should subject to themselves the society in which they are, and then others; 
and lest any from the lust of gain should despoil others of their goods. Everyone on that earth lives content with his goods, and everyone content with his honor in being called just and a lover of his 
neighbor. This delight and tranquillity of mind would perish, unless those who think and will evilly were cast out, and unless they prudently and severely met the first beginnings of the love of self 
and the love of the world with those into whom they enter; for it was these loves which out of societies made empires and kingdoms, within which there are few who do not desire to domineer, and to possess 
all the property of others; there being few who do what is just and equitable from justice and equity, and still fewer who do what is good from charity, and what is true from faith, and not rather 
from fear of the law, of injury, of life, or of the loss of gain, honor, and reputation on account of these. </p>

<p align="center"><b>Elliott(1983-1999) 7364</b></p><p><b>7364.</b>
Those in their communities who begin to think what is wrong, and then go on to will it, are banished from their community and left alone on their own. As a consequence they lead a very wretched existence 
outside society, living among rocks or whatever; for their communities are no longer interested in them. Some such communities do try in various ways to compel those people to come to their senses; 
but when this proves to be all to no avail they sever their connection with them. In doing this they are taking precautions to prevent the desire to exercise control and the desire for gain from creeping 
in, that is, to prevent any who are moved by a desire to exercise control from setting themselves up over the community they are in, and after that over many other communities, and to prevent any 
moved by a desire for gain from seizing others' possessions from them. Everyone there lives satisfied with what he has, and everyone lives satisfied with the respect in which he is held for being righteous 
and showing love towards the neighbour. This delightful and peaceful state of mind would be destroyed if those who think what is bad and will it were not cast out, and if judicious and firm steps 
were not taken to counteract in their earliest beginnings self-love and love of the world with whomever they exist. For these loves are what have been responsible for the conversion of communities 
into empires and kingdoms, within which there are few people who do not wish to exercise control and possess everything belonging to others. Few are they who do what is just and fair from a desire for 
what is just and fair, fewer still those who do what is good from charity, and what is true from faith. Those things are done instead from fear of the law, damnation, loss of life, loss of gain and 
position, and loss of reputation on account of these last. </p>

</p><b>7364.</b>
Qui in societatibus illorum incipiunt sinistre cogitate, (c)et inde sinistre velle, {1}dissociantur, relinquunt illos sibi solis, unde degunt extra societatem, admodum misere, in petris aut alibi, nam 
illos non amplius curant; quaedam societates tales ad resipiscentiam variis modis tentant cogere, sed cum hoc incassum fit, ab illis se dissociant.  Ita praecavent ne cupiditas dominii et cupiditas 
lucri irrepant, hoc est, ne aliqui ex cupiditate dominii sibi subjiciant societatem in qua sunt; et dein plures alias; et ne aliqui ex cupiditate lucri sua bona aliis eripiant; quisque ibi suis bonis 
contentus vivit, et quisque suo honore quod audiat justus et proximi amans; hoc jucundum et tranquillum {2}animi periturum foret, nisi illi qui male cogitant et male volunt ejicerentur, et nisi prudenter 
et severe obviam irent in ipsis initiis amori sui et amori mundi, apud quos illi sunt; hi enim amores sunt qui fecerunt ut ex societatibus imperia et regna facta sint, {3}intra quae pauci sunt qui 
non dominari volunt ac possidere omnia aliorum, nam pauci sunt qui justum et aequum ex justo et aequo faciunt, minus qui bonum ex charitate et verum ex fide, sed ex timore legis, damni, vitae, jacturae 
lucri, honoris, et famae propter illa. 	@1 ab illis se dissociant, et tunc hi relinquuntur sibi solis degentum$ 	@2 Before jucundum$ 	@3 in quibis$ </p>
