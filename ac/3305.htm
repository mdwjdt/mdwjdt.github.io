<h3 align="center" class="ired">属天的奥秘 第3305节</h3>
<h4 align="center"></h4><p><strong>3305.</strong>“他就给他起名叫雅各”表属世真理的教义。这从“起名”或“名叫”的含义清楚可知，“起名”或“名叫”是指本质，如刚才所述（参看<a href="3302.htm">3302</a>节）。“雅各”所代表所本质是属世真理的教义，这从以扫的代表和圣言中提及他的许多经文可以看出来，以扫是指构成属世真理生活的良善（<a href="3300.htm">3300</a>节）。有两个要素构成属世人，如同有两个要素构成理性人，甚至构成整个人一样。其中一个属于生活，另一个属于教义。属于生活的要素属于意愿，而属于教义的要素属于理解力。前者被称为良善，后者被称为真理。这良善由以扫来代表，这真理由雅各来代表；或也可说，构成属世真理生活的良善由以扫来代表，属世真理的教义由雅各来代表。无论你说构成属世真理生活的良善和属世真理的教义，还是那些具有这类教义和生活的人，意思都一样，因为生活的良善和真理的教义无法脱离它们的主体而存在。它们若没有主体，就只是一种抽象概念，然而，它们关注它们存在于其中的这个人。所以雅各在此表示那些拥有属世真理教义的人。<br />那些局限于字义的人以为圣言中的雅各是指源于雅各的百姓中的每个人，因此，他们将指着雅各所说的一切事，无论历史部分还是预言部分中的，都归到这些人身上。但首要的是，圣言是神性，其中的一切事物，无论总体还是细节，不仅仅关注一个特定民族或人民，也关注整个人类，即现在、过去和未来的每一个人；此外还关注更普遍的，就是主在天上的国度；在至高意义上则关注主自己。圣言正是由于这个原因而为神性。圣言若只关注一个民族，那就只是人类的，其中除了那个民族所具有的神圣敬拜外，再没有丝毫神性之物了。谁都能看出，这类敬拜并不存在于被称为“雅各”的百姓当中。由此明显可知，圣言中的“雅各”并非指雅各，“以色列”也不是指以色列，因为预言部分中几乎每一处提及雅各时，也会提及以色列。若不通过其中深藏并包含天堂奥秘的那层意义，没有人能知道雅各具体是什么意思，以色列具体又是什么意思。<br />因此，就内义而言，“雅各”表属世真理的教义，或也可说，表那些拥有这种教义的人，无论他们属于哪个民族。就至高意义而言，“雅各”表示主。这从以下经文明显看出来，路加福音：<br />天使对她说，马利亚，不要怕！你要怀孕生子，可以给祂起名叫耶稣。祂要为大，称为至高者的儿子，主神要把祂祖大卫的御座给祂。祂必掌王权管理雅各家，直到永远；祂的国也没有穷尽。（路加福音<a href="http://39-27.cn/路1.30.htm">1:30</a>-<a href="http://39-27.cn/路1.33.htm">33</a>）<br />谁都能看出，此处“雅各家”不是指犹太民族或人民，因为主的国不仅包括那人民，还包括全世界信祂并因信而拥有仁的所有人。由此清楚可知，天使在此所提“雅各”之名不是指雅各的子民，因而在其它地方也不是指这些人。经常出现在旧约圣言中的“雅各的种”、“雅各的子孙”、“雅各的产业”、“雅各的王”和“雅各的神”等词也不是字面上的意思。<br />“以色列”的情形也一样，如马太福音：<br />有主的使者向约瑟梦中显现，说，起来！带着小孩子同他母亲逃往埃及；这是要应验主借先知所说的话，说，我从埃及召出我的儿子来。（马太福音<a href="http://39-27.cn/太2.13.htm">2:13</a>，<a href="http://39-27.cn/太2.15.htm">15</a>）<br />在先知书，经上说：<br />以色列为孩提时我爱他，就从埃及召出我的儿子来。（何西阿书<a href="http://39-27.cn/何11.1.htm">11:1</a>）<br />此处很明显，“以色列”是指主。然而，从字义只能知道以下事实：“孩提时的以色列”表示来到埃及、后来从那里被召唤出来的雅各最早的后代。这在提及“雅各”和“以色列”之名的其它经文也一样，尽管从字义上看，这一点并不明显，如以赛亚书：<br />我的仆人雅各、我所拣选的以色列啊，现在你当听！那制作了你、那从你母腹就形成了你、又要帮助你的耶和华如此说，我的仆人雅各、我所拣选的耶书仑哪，不要害怕！因为我要将水浇灌口渴的人，将河浇灌干旱之地；我要将我的灵浇灌你的种，将我的福浇灌你的后裔。这个要说，我是属耶和华的；那个要以雅各的名自称；又一个要亲手写归耶和华，并以以色列之名为姓。（以赛亚书<a href="http://39-27.cn/赛44.1.htm">44:1</a>-<a href="http://39-27.cn/赛44.3.htm">3</a>，<a href="http://39-27.cn/赛44.5.htm">5</a>）<br />此处“雅各”和“以色列”明显表示主，“种”和“雅各的后裔”表示那些信祂的人。<br />在摩西五经中关于以色列人的预言：<br />约瑟要坐在他弓的力量里，他的手臂健壮敏捷，这是因着雅各之大能者的手，以色列的牧者、石头是从那里而出的。（创世记<a href="http://39-27.cn/创49.24.htm">49:24</a>）<br />此处“雅各之大能者”和“以色列的石头”也明显表示主。以赛亚书：<br />我必不将我的荣耀归给别人；雅各啊，我呼召的以色列，当听我言：我是耶和华，我是首先的，也是末后的。（以赛亚书<a href="http://39-27.cn/赛48.11.htm">48:11</a>-<a href="http://39-27.cn/赛48.12.htm">12</a>）<br />此处“雅各”和“以色列”同样表示主。以西结书：<br />我必取约瑟的杖，就是在以法莲手中的，和他同伴以色列支派的杖，，将它们与犹大的杖连在一起，使它们在我手中成为一根。我要将以色列人从他们所到的列族收取，又从四围聚集他们，领他们回到本地。我要使他们在那地，在以色列山上成为一族，有一王作他们众人的王。他们不再为二族，决不再分为二国。我的仆人大卫必作他们的王，他们众人只有一个牧者。他们必住在我赐给我仆人雅各的地上，就是你们列祖所住之地。他们和他们的子孙，并子孙的子孙，都永远住在那里。我的仆人大卫必作他们的王，直到永远。并且我要与他们立平安的约，这必做与他们所立永远的约。我也要安置他们，使他们的人数增多，又在他们中间设立我的圣所，直到永远。我的帐幕也要与他们同在。我要作他们的神，他们要作我的子民。我的圣所在以色列人中间直到永远，列族就必知道我是叫以色列成为圣的耶和华。（以西结书<a href="http://39-27.cn/结37.19.htm">37:19</a>，<a href="http://39-27.cn/结37.21.htm">21</a>-<a href="http://39-27.cn/结37.22.htm">22</a>，<a href="http://39-27.cn/结37.24.htm">24</a>-<a href="http://39-27.cn/结37.28.htm">28</a>）<br />此处同样显而易见，“约瑟”、“以法莲”、“犹大”、“以色列”、“雅各”和“大卫”不是指这些人，从至高意义上说，是指在主里面、存在于主国度及其教会中的神性属灵事物。谁都能知道，如前所述，大卫不会永远作他们的王和首领，“大卫”表示主（参看<a href="1888.htm">1888</a>节）。谁也可以知道，以色列不会从他们所分散之地被聚集起来，不会被成圣，圣所也不会永远设在他们当中，如前所述；而是这一切要与那些就代表意义而言由“以色列”来表示的人同在，如众所周知的，这些人都是那些有信的人。<br />弥迦书：<br />雅各啊，我必要聚集你们所有的人，必要招聚以色列剩下的人，安置在一处，如波斯拉的羊，又如草场上的羊群。（弥迦书<a href="http://39-27.cn/弥2.12.htm">2:12</a>）<br />此处意思一样。以赛亚书：<br />雅各要使那些要来的人扎根，以色列要发芽开花，他们必以果实遍满地面。（以赛亚书<a href="http://39-27.cn/赛27.6.htm">27:6</a>）<br />此处意思也一样。同一先知书：<br />救赎亚伯拉罕的耶和华论雅各家如此说：雅各必不再羞愧，面容也不到苍白；因为他看见他的众子，就是我手的工作在他当中，他们必尊我的名为圣，必尊雅各的圣者为圣，必敬畏以色列的神。灵中昏谬的必懂得明达。（以赛亚书<a href="http://39-27.cn/赛29.22.htm">29:22</a>-<a href="http://39-27.cn/赛29.24.htm">24</a>）<br />同一先知书：<br />耶和华对祂所膏的古列如此说：我搀扶他的右手，使列族降伏在他面前。我也要放松列王的腰带，使门户在他面前敞开，城门不得关闭。我必在你前面行，修平崎岖之地。我必打碎铜门，砍断铁闩。我要将暗中的宝物和隐密处的财宝赐给你，使你知道提名召你的，就是我耶和华，以色列的神。因我仆人雅各、我所拣选以色列的缘故，我就提名召你；你虽不认识我，我也加给你名号。（以赛亚书<a href="http://39-27.cn/赛45.1.htm">45:1</a>-<a href="http://39-27.cn/赛45.4.htm">4</a>）<br />这也明显论及主。弥迦书：<br />末后的日子，耶和华殿的山必坚立，为众山之首；必有许多民族前往说，来吧！我们登耶和华的山，奔雅各神的殿。主必将祂的道教训我们，我们也要行他的路。因为训诲必出于锡安，耶和华的言语必出于耶路撒冷。（弥迦书<a href="http://39-27.cn/弥4.1.htm">4:1</a>-<a href="http://39-27.cn/弥4.2.htm">2</a>）<br />诗篇：<br />耶和华爱锡安的城门，胜于爱雅各一切的住处。神的城啊，有荣耀的事乃指着你说的。（诗篇<a href="http://39-27.cn/诗87.2.htm">87:2</a>-<a href="http://39-27.cn/诗87.3.htm">3</a>）<br />耶利米书：<br />你们却要事奉耶和华你们的神，和我为你们所要兴起的王大卫。我的仆人雅各啊，不要惧怕；以色列啊，不要惊惶；因我要从远方拯救你。（耶利米书<a href="http://39-27.cn/耶30.9.htm">30:9</a>，<a href="http://39-27.cn/耶30.10.htm">10</a>）<br />以赛亚书：<br />众海岛啊，听我吧！远方的众民哪，留心而听！自我出胎，耶和华就呼召我；自出母腹，祂就提我的名。祂对我说，你是我的仆人以色列，我必因你得荣耀。（以赛亚书<a href="http://39-27.cn/赛49.1.htm">49:1</a>，<a href="http://39-27.cn/赛49.3.htm">3</a>）<br /><br />那么，你就以耶和华为乐，我要使你乘驾地的高处，又以雅各的产业养育你。（以赛亚书<a href="http://39-27.cn/赛58.14.htm">58:14</a>）<br /><br />我必将雅各的种领出来，从犹大中领出承受我众山的。我的选民必承受；我的仆人要在那里居住。（以赛亚书<a href="http://39-27.cn/赛65.9.htm">65:9</a>）<br />在所有这些经文中，就至高意义而言，“雅各”和“以色列”表示主；就代表意义而言，表示主的属灵国度，以及教会，该教会凭真理的教义和良善的生活而成为教会。“雅各”表示那些处于该教会的外在之人，“以色列”则表示那些处于其内在之人。从这些和许多其它经文明显可知，“雅各”没有一处是指雅各，“以色列”也没有一处是指以色列。同样，“以撒”和“亚伯拉罕”被提及时也不是指以撒和亚伯拉罕，如马太福音：<br />从东从西，将有许多人来，在天国里与亚伯拉罕、以撒、雅各一同坐席（马太福音<a href="http://39-27.cn/太8.11.htm">8:11</a>）<br />路加福音：<br />你们要看见亚伯拉罕、以撒、雅各，和众先知都在神的国里。（路加福音<a href="http://39-27.cn/路13.28.htm">13:28</a>）<br /><br />拉撒路被天使带去放在亚伯拉罕的怀里。（路加福音<a href="http://39-27.cn/路16.20.htm">16:20</a>，<a href="http://39-27.cn/路16.22.htm">22</a>）<br />因为在天堂，天使根本不知道亚伯拉罕、以撒和雅各。当世人读到这些话时，天使只理解为主的神性和神性人。“与亚伯拉罕、以撒、雅各一同坐席”，他们理解为与主同在；“在亚伯拉罕的怀里”，他们理解为安息在主里面。但经上之所以这样说，是因为那时，人类如此远离内在事物，以致除了圣言中的一切事物都要取字义外，他们不知道，也不想知道别的。主照字面与他们说话，是为了他们能接受信，同时也为了内义能包含在祂所说的话中，人通过这内义与祂自己联结。由此可见在旧约圣言中，“雅各的神”和“以色列的圣者”表示什么，即表示主自己。“雅各的神”是指主（参看撒母耳记下<a href="http://39-27.cn/撒下23.1.htm">23:1</a>；以赛亚书<a href="http://39-27.cn/赛2.3.htm">2:3</a>；<a href="http://39-27.cn/赛41.21.htm">41:21</a>；弥迦书<a href="http://39-27.cn/弥4.2.htm">4:2</a>；诗篇<a

And he called his name Jacob. That this signifies the doctrine of truth of the natural, is evident from the signification of "calling a name," or of "calling by name," as being quality (concerning which 
see just above, n. 3302). The quality that is represented by Jacob is the doctrine of truth of the natural, as may be seen from the representation of Esau, as being the good of life of the truth of 
the natural (n. 3300), and from many places in the Word, where he is named. There are two things which constitute the natural, as there are two that constitute the rational, nay, that constitute the 
whole man, one of which is of life, and the other of doctrine. That which is of life belongs to the will, while that which is of doctrine belongs to the understanding. The former is called good, and 
the latter truth. This good is that which is represented by Esau, and the truth by Jacob; or what is the same, the good of life of the truth of the natural is that which is represented by Esau, and the 
doctrine of truth of the natural is that which is represented by Jacob. Whether you say the good of life of the truth of the natural and the doctrine of truth of the natural, or those who are in these 
things, it is the same; for the good of life and the doctrine of truth cannot exist apart from their subject. If they have no subject they are a kind of abstract affair which nevertheless has regard 
to the man in whom this may be. Wherefore by "Jacob" are here signified those who are in the doctrine of truth of the natural.  [2] They who abide in the mere sense of the letter believe that by "Jacob" 
in the Word is meant all that people which was descended from Jacob, and for this reason they apply to that people all things that have been said historically and prophetically concerning Jacob. 
But the Word is Divine chiefly in this respect, that all things in it both in general and in particular do not regard one nation or one people, but the universal human race; namely, that which is, which 
has been, and which will be; and also that which is still more universal, namely, the Lord's kingdom in the heavens; and in the supreme sense, the Lord Himself. It is for this reason that the Word 
is Divine. If it had regard merely to one nation, then it would be human, and there would be nothing more of the Divine in it than there was of the holy of worship with that nation; and everyone may 
know that there was none of this with the people called "Jacob;" from which it is evident that by "Jacob" in the Word is not meant Jacob, and also that by "Israel" is not meant Israel; for almost everywhere 
in the prophecies, when Jacob is named, Israel is named also, and no one can know what is specifically meant by the one, and what by the other, except from the sense which lies more deeply concealed 
and contains within it the arcana of heaven. [3] That by "Jacob" therefore in the internal sense is signified the doctrine of truth of the natural; or what is the same, those who are in this doctrine, 
of whatever nation they may be; and that in the supreme sense the Lord is meant is evident from the following passages. In Luke: </p>
<p>     The angel said unto her, Fear not, Mary, for thou shalt conceive 
in thy womb, and shalt bring forth a Son, and shalt call His name Jesus. He shall be great, and shall be called the Son of the Most High; and the Lord God shall give unto Him the throne of His 
father David; and He shall reign over the house of Jacob forever; and of His kingdom there shall be no end (Luke 1:30-33). That here by the "house of Jacob" is not meant the Jewish nation or people 
can be seen by all, for the Lord's kingdom was not over that people, but over all in the universe who have faith in Him, and who from faith are in charity. Hence it is evident that by "Jacob" as here 
named by the angel is not meant the people of Jacob; and consequently neither in other places, by the "seed of Jacob," the "sons of Jacob," the "land of Jacob," the "inheritance of Jacob," the "king of 
Jacob," and the "God of Jacob," which expressions so often occur in the Word of the Old Testament, are these intended. [4] The case is the same in respect to "Israel" as in Matthew: </p>
<p>     The angel 
of the Lord appeareth to Joseph in a dream, saying, Arise and take the young child and his mother, and flee into Egypt; that it might be fulfilled which was spoken by the Lord through the prophet, saying, 
Out of Egypt have I called My Son (Matt. 2:13, 15); </p>
<p>and in the prophet it is said: </p>
<p>     When Israel was a child, then I loved him, and called My son out of Egypt (Hos. 11:1). That in this passage 
"Israel" is the Lord is very evident; and yet from the sense of the letter it cannot be known but that the "child Israel" means the earliest descendants of Jacob, who came into Egypt and were afterwards 
called out thence. It is the same in other passages where "Jacob" and "Israel" are named, although this does not appear from the sense of the letter, as in Isaiah: </p>
<p>     Hear O Jacob my servant; 
and Israel, whom I have chosen; thus saith Jehovah who made thee, and formed thee from the womb, who will help thee; Fear not O Jacob my servant, and thou Jeshurun whom I have chosen; for I will pour 
water upon him that is thirsty, and streams upon the dry ground; I will pour My spirit upon thy seed, and My blessing upon thine offspring; this one shall say, I am Jehovah's; and this shall call himself 
by the name of Jacob; and that one shall write with his hand unto Jehovah, and surname himself by the name of Israel (Isa. 44:1-3, 5); </p>
<p>where "Jacob" and "Israel" evidently denote the Lord; and 
the "seed," and "offspring of Jacob," those who are in faith in Him. [5] In the prophecy concerning the sons of Israel in Moses: </p>
<p>     Joseph shall sit in the strength of his bow, and the arms of his 
hands shall be made strong by the hands of the Mighty One of Jacob; from thence is the shepherd, the stone of Israel (Gen. 49:24); </p>
<p>where also the "Mighty One of Jacob" and the "stone of Israel" clearly 
denote the Lord. In Isaiah: </p>
<p>     My glory will I not give to another; attend unto Me, O Jacob, and Israel My called, I am He; I am the first, I also am the last (Isa. 48:11-12); </p>
<p>here also "Jacob" 
and "Israel" signify the Lord. In Ezekiel: </p>
<p>     I will take the stick of Joseph, which is in the hand of Ephraim, and the tribes of Israel his companions, and I will add them upon him with the stick 
of Judah, and make them one stick, and they shall be one in My hand. I will take the sons of Israel from among the nations, whither they be gone, and will gather them from every side, and bring them 
upon their own land; and I will make them one nation in the land, upon the mountains of Israel; and one king shall be king to them all, and they shall be no more two nations, neither shall they be divided 
into two kingdoms anymore at all. My servant David shall be king over them, and they all shall have one shepherd. And they shall dwell on the land that I have given unto Jacob My servant, wherein 
your fathers dwelt; and they shall dwell therein, they and their sons, and their sons, forever; and David My servant shall be prince to them forever: I will make a covenant of peace with them, it shall 
be an everlasting covenant with them; and I will place them, and multiply them, and will set My sanctuary in the midst of them forevermore. My tabernacle also shall be with them; and I will be their 
God, and they shall be My people. And the nations shall know that I Jehovah do sanctify Israel, when My sanctuary is in the midst of them for evermore (Ezek. 37:19, 21-22, 24-28); </p>
<p>here again it is 
clearly manifest that by "Joseph," "Ephraim," "Judah," "Israel," "Jacob," and "David," are not meant these persons, but in the supreme sense Divine spiritual things which are in the Lord, and which 
are the Lord's in His kingdom and church. That David was not to be, as is said, their king and prince forever, everyone may know; but that by "David" is meant the Lord may be seen above (n. 1888). It 
may also be known that Israel will not be gathered together from wherever they have been dispersed, and will not be sanctified, and the sanctuary placed in the midst of them forever, as is said; but this 
is to be with those who in the representative sense are signified by "Israel;" and who, as is known, are all the faithful. [6] In Micah: </p>
<p>     Assembling I will assemble O Jacob, all of thee; gathering 
I will gather the remnant of Israel; I will put them together as the sheep of Bozrah (Micah 2:12); </p>
<p>where the meaning is similar. In Isaiah: </p>
<p>     Jacob shall cause to take root those who come; 
Israel shall blossom and bud; and they shall fill the face of the world with produce (Isa. 27:6); </p>
<p>where also the meaning is similar. In the same: </p>
<p>     Thus saith Jehovah who redeemed Abraham, to the 
house of Jacob; Jacob shall not now be ashamed, neither shall his face now wax pale; for when he seeth his children, the work of My hands, in the midst of him, they shall sanctify My name; yea, they 
shall sanctify the Holy One of Jacob, and shall stand in awe of the God of Israel. They also that err in spirit shall know intelligence (Isa. 29:22-24). In the same: </p>
<p>     Thus saith Jehovah to His 
anointed, to Cyrus, whose right hand I have holden, to subdue nations before him, and I will loose the loins of kings; to open the doors before him, and the gates shall not be shut; I will go before thee, 
and make the crooked places straight; I will break in pieces the doors of brass, and cut in sunder the bars of iron; I will give thee the treasures of darkness, and hidden riches of secret places, 
that thou mayest know that I am Jehovah, who am called by thy name, the God of Israel, for Jacob My servant's sake, and Israel Mine elect. I have called thee by thy name, I have surnamed thee when thou 
didst not know Me (Isa. 45:1-4); </p>
<p>where also the Lord is plainly treated of. In Micah: </p>
<p>     In the last days it shall come to pass that the mountain of the house of Jehovah shall be established as 
the head of the mountains; and many nations shall go, and say, Come ye, and let us go up to the mountain of Jehovah, and to the house of the God of Jacob; and He will teach us of His ways, and we will 
walk in His paths; for out of Zion shall go forth the doctrine, and the Word of Jehovah from Jerusalem (Micah 4:1-2). In David: </p>
<p>     Jehovah loveth the gates of Zion more than all the dwellings of 
Jacob; glorious things shall be preached in thee, O city of God (Ps. 87:2-3). In Jeremiah: </p>
<p>     They shall serve Jehovah their God, and David their king, whom I will raise up unto them. And thou, 
fear thou not, O Jacob My servant, saith Jehovah; neither be dismayed, O Israel; for lo I will save thee from afar (Jer. 30:9, 10). In Isaiah: </p>
<p>     Listen O isles unto me; and hearken ye peoples from 
far; Jehovah hath called me from the womb; from the bowels of my mother hath He made mention of my name; and He said unto me, Thou art My servant Israel, in whom I will be made glorious (Isa. 49:1, 
3). Again: </p>
<p>     Then shalt thou delight thyself in Jehovah, and I will make thee to ride upon the high places of the earth, and I will feed thee with the heritage of Jacob (Isa. 58:14). Again: </p>
<p>   
  I will bring forth a seed out of Jacob, and out of Judah an inheritor of My mountains, that Mine elect may possess it, and My servants shall dwell there (Isa. 65:9). [7] In the supreme sense of all 
these passages by "Jacob" and "Israel" is meant the Lord; and in the representative sense the Lord's spiritual kingdom, and the church which is a church from the doctrine of truth and the life of good. 
By "Jacob" are meant those who are in the externals of this church; and by "Israel" those who are in its internals. From these and many other passages it is evident that by "Jacob" is nowhere meant 
Jacob, neither by "Israel," Israel; and in the same way, by "Isaac" is not meant Isaac, nor by "Abraham," Abraham, where they are named; as in Matthew: </p>
<p>     Many shall come from the east and the west, 
and shall recline with Abraham, and Isaac, and Jacob, in the kingdom of the heavens (Matt. 8:11). In Luke: </p>
<p>     Ye shall see Abraham, and Isaac, and Jacob, and all the prophets in the kingdom of 
God (Luke 13:28). and again: </p>
<p>     Lazarus was carried by the angels into Abraham's bosom (Luke 16:20, 22). For in heaven they know nothing of Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob; and when these words are read 
by man, the angels perceive nought but the Lord as to the Divine and the Divine Human; and by "reclining with Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob," they perceive nought but being with the Lord; and by being "in 
Abraham's bosom," nought but being in the Lord. But it was thus said because at that time man was so far removed from internal things that he did not know and was not willing to know otherwise than 
that all things in the Word are according to the letter; and when the Lord spoke with men according to the letter, it was that they might receive faith, and also that there might even then be an internal 
sense within, by which there could be the conjunction of man with Himself. This being the case, it may appear what is signified in the Word of the Old Testament by the "God of Jacob," and by the 
"Holy One of Israel," namely, the Lord Himself. (That the "God of Jacob" is the Lord, see 2 Sam. 23:1; Isa. 2:3; 41:21; Micah 4:2; Ps. 20:1; 46:7; 75:9; 76:6; 81:1, 4; 84:8; 94:7; 114:7; 132:2; 146:5. 
That the "Holy One of Israel" is the Lord, see Isa. 1:4; 5:19, 24; 10:20; 12:6; 17:7; 29:19; 30:11, 12, 15; 31:1; 37:23; 41:14, 16, 20; 43:3, 14; 45:11; 47:4; 48:17; 49:7; 54:5; 55:5; 60:14; Jer. 50:29; 
Ezek. 39:7; Ps. 71:22; 78:41; 89:18.) </p>

<p align="center"><b>Elliott(1983-1999) 3305</b></p><p><b>3305.</b>
'And he called his name Jacob' means the doctrine of natural truth. This is clear from the meaning of 'calling the name' or calling by name as the essential nature, dealt with just above in <a href="3302.htm">3302</a>. The 
essential nature represented by 'Jacob' is the doctrine of natural truth, as becomes clear from the representation of Esau as good constituting the life of natural truth, <a href="3300.htm">3300</a>, and from very many places 
in the Word where he is mentioned. There are two elements which constitute the natural, as there are two which constitute the rational, and indeed which constitute the whole person - the first being 
that of life, the second that of doctrine. The element of life belongs to the will, that of doctrine to the understanding. The former is called good, but the latter truth. It is that good which is 
represented by Esau, but this truth by Jacob; or what amounts to the same, it is good constituting the life of natural truth that is represented by Esau, and the doctrine of natural truth that is represented 
by Jacob. Whether you speak of the good constituting the life of natural truth and of the doctrine of natural truth, or of those in whom such doctrine and life are present, it amounts to the same, 
for the good constituting the life and the doctrine of truth cannot exist apart from their subject. Without their subject they are mere abstractions, yet they nevertheless have regard to the person 
in whom they exist. Consequently Jacob here means people who possess the doctrine of natural truth. </p>
<p></p>
<p><b>[2]</b>
 Those who confine themselves to the sense of the letter suppose that in the Word Jacob is 
used to mean every one of those people descended from Jacob, and for that reason they apply to those people everything that has been stated about Jacob either as history or as prophecy. But the Word is 
Divine in that first and foremost every single thing within it has regard not just to one particular nation or people but to the whole human race, namely to everyone present, past, and future. More 
than that, it has reference to the Lord's kingdom in heaven; and in the highest sense to the Lord Himself. This is what makes it a Divine Word. If it were concerned with merely one particular nation it 
would be human only and would have nothing more of the Divine within it than the existence among that nation of holy worship. The fact that such worship did not exist among the people called 'Jacob' 
may be known to anyone. For this reason also it is evident that 'Jacob' is not used in the Word to mean Jacob, nor 'Israel' to mean Israel - for almost everywhere in prophetical parts, when Jacob is 
referred to, Israel is mentioned too. And no one can know what is meant specifically by the first or what by the second except from that sense which lies more deeply and conceals the arcana of heaven 
within itself. </p>
<p></p>
<p><b>[3]</b>
 In the internal sense therefore 'Jacob' means the doctrine of natural truth, or what amounts to the same, people who possess that doctrine, no matter what nation they belong to; 
and in the highest sense 'Jacob' is used to mean the Lord, as becomes clear from the following places: In Luke, </p>
<blockquote>
The angel said to Mary, You will conceive in your womb and bear a Son, and you shall 
call His name Jesus. He will be great, and will be called the Son of the Most High; and the Lord God will give to Him the throne of His father David, so that He will reign over the house of Jacob for 
ever, and of His kingdom there will be no end. <a href="http://bible.gospelcom.net/cgi-bin/bible?passage=Luke%201:31-33&amp;version=ESV&amp;interface=print&amp;showfn=yes&amp;showxref">Luke 1:31-33</a>. 
</blockquote>
<p>Everyone recognizes that here 'the house of Jacob' was not used to mean the Jewish nation or people, for the Lord's kingdom included not 
merely that people but all throughout the world who have faith in Him, and from faith have charity. From this it is clear that when the angel used the name Jacob he did not mean the people of Jacob. 
Nor consequently are those people meant anywhere else. Nor are the references to the seed of Jacob, the sons of Jacob, the land of Jacob, the inheritance of Jacob, the king of Jacob, and the God of Jacob, 
which occur so many times in the Old Testament Word, meant literally. </p>
<p></p>
<p><b>[4]</b>
 It is similar with the name Israel, as in Matthew, </p>
<blockquote>
The angel of the Lord appeared to Joseph in a dream, saying, Rise, 
take the Boy and His mother, and flee into Egypt, and be there until I tell you. He rose and took the Boy and His mother by night, and departed into Egypt, so that what had been said by the prophet 
might be fulfilled, when he said, Out of Egypt have I called My Son. <a href="http://bible.gospelcom.net/cgi-bin/bible?passage=Matt%202:13-15&amp;version=ESV&amp;interface=print&amp;showfn=yes&amp;showxref">Matt 2:13-15</a>. 
</blockquote>
<p>In the prophet this promise is stated as follows, </p>
<blockquote>
When Israel was a boy I loved him, and out of Egypt I called 
my son. <a href="http://bible.gospelcom.net/cgi-bin/bible?passage=Hosea%2011:1&amp;version=ESV&amp;interface=print&amp;showfn=yes&amp;showxref">Hosea 11:1</a>. 
</blockquote>
<p>Here it is quite evident that 'Israel' is the Lord. From the sense of the letter however nothing more may be known beyond the fact that 'the boy Israel' means the immediate descendants 
of Jacob who came into Egypt and at a later time were summoned from there. It is similar in other places where the names Jacob and Israel occur, although it is not apparent from the sense of 
the letter, as in Isaiah, </p>
<blockquote>
Hear, O Jacob my servant, and Israel whom I have chosen, Thus said Jehovah who made you and formed you from the womb, who helps you, Fear not, O my servant Jacob, and Jeshurun 
whom I have chosen, for I will pour out waters upon thirsty land, and rivers upon the dry. I will pour out My spirit upon your seed, and My blessing upon your sons. This one will say, I am Jehovah's, 
and another will call himself by the name of Jacob, and he will write with his hand, Jehovah's, and surname himself by the name of Israel. <a href="http://bible.gospelcom.net/cgi-bin/bible?passage=Isa%2044:1-3,%205&amp;version=ESV&amp;interface=print&amp;showfn=yes&amp;showxref">Isa 44:1-3, 5</a>. 
</blockquote>
<p>Here 'Jacob' and 'Israel' plainly stand 
for the Lord, and 'the seed' and 'the sons of Jacob' for those having faith in Him. </p>
<p></p>
<p><b>[5]</b>
 In the prophecy concerning Israel's sons, in Moses, </p>
<blockquote>
Joseph will sit in the strength of his bow, and the 
arms of his hands will be made strong by the hands of the mighty Jacob; from there is the Shepherd, the Stone of Israel. <a href="http://bible.gospelcom.net/cgi-bin/bible?passage=Gen%2049:24&amp;version=ESV&amp;interface=print&amp;showfn=yes&amp;showxref">Gen 49:24</a>. 
</blockquote>
<p>Here also 'the mighty Jacob' and 'the Stone of Israel' plainly 
stand for the Lord. In Isaiah, </p>
<blockquote>
My glory will I not give to another. Hearken to Me, O Jacob, and O Israel whom I called: I am the same; I am the first; I am also the last. <a href="http://bible.gospelcom.net/cgi-bin/bible?passage=Isa%2048:11,%2012&amp;version=ESV&amp;interface=print&amp;showfn=yes&amp;showxref">Isa 48:11, 12</a>. 
</blockquote>
<p>Here again 
'Jacob' and 'Israel' are the Lord. In Ezekiel, </p>
<p>I will take the stick of Joseph which is in the hand of Ephraim and of the tribes of Israel his companions, and I will add them to it, to the stick 
of Judah, and make them into one stick, that they may be one in My hand. I will take the children of Israel from among the nations where they have gone, and will gather them from all around and bring 
them on to their own land. And I will make them into one nation in the land, on the mountains of Israel; and one king will be king to them all, and they will no longer be two nations, nor will they 
ever be divided into two kingdoms again. My servant David will be king over them, and they will all have one shepherd. At that time they will dwell in the land which I gave to Jacob my servant, in which 
your fathers dwelt. They will dwell in it, they, and their sons, and their sons' sons even for ever. David My servant will be their prince for ever. I will make with them a covenant of peace; it will 
be an eternal covenant with them. I will bless<A name="fntext1"></a><A href="#fn1"><sup>a</sup></a> them, and multiply them, and I will set My sanctuary in their midst for evermore. Thus will My dwelling-place be with them, and I will be their God. 
and they will be My people, so that the nations may know that I Jehovah sanctify Israel, to be My sanctuary in their midst for evermore. <a href="http://bible.gospelcom.net/cgi-bin/bible?passage=Ezek%2037:19,%2021,%2022,%2024-28&amp;version=ESV&amp;interface=print&amp;showfn=yes&amp;showxref">Ezek 37:19, 21, 22, 24-28</a>. </p>
<p>Here again it is quite clear that 
'Joseph', 'Ephraim', 'Judah', 'Israel', 'Jacob', and 'David' are not used to mean those persons, but in the highest sense Divine spiritual things within the Lord and which exist in the Lord's kingdom 
and in His Church. Anyone may know that David will not be, as is said, their king and prince for ever, but that 'David' is used to mean the Lord, <a href="1888.htm">1888</a>. Anyone may also know that Israel will not be 
gathered together from where they have been scattered, or that they will be sanctified, or, as is said, that the sanctuary will be set in their midst, but that, as is well known, 'Israel' in the representative 
sense means all those who have faith. </p>

 In Micah, </p>
<blockquote>
I will surely gather Jacob, all of you, I will surely assemble the remnant of Israel; I will put them together, like the sheep of Bozrah.

err in spirit will know understanding. <a href="http://bible.gospelcom.net/cgi-bin/bible?passage=Isa%2029:22-24&amp;version=ESV&amp;interface=print&amp;showfn=yes&amp;showxref">Isa 29:22-24</a>.

of iron, I will give you the treasures of concealed places, and the secret wealth of hoarded objects, that you may know that it is I, Jehovah, who called you by your name, the God of Israel. For the

<p>This also clearly refers to the Lord. In Micah, </p>
<blockquote>
In 
the latter days the mountain of the house of Jehovah will be established at the head of the mountains. Many nations will come and say, Come and let us go up to the mountain of Jehovah, and to the house 
of the God of Jacob, that He may teach us about His ways, and we will go in His paths.

<p><b>[7]</b>
 In all 
these places 'Jacob' and 'Israel' are used in the highest sense to mean the Lord, and in the representative sense the Lord's spiritual kingdom, and the Church which is the Church by virtue of the doctrine 
of truth and the life of good - 'Jacob' meaning those who are in the external aspects of that Church, and 'Israel' those who are in the internal. These and very many other places show that nowhere 
is 'Jacob' used to mean Jacob, or 'Israel' to mean Israel, any more than when the names 'Isaac' and 'Abraham' are used Isaac or Abraham is meant, as in Matthew, </p>
<blockquote>
Many will come from the east and 
from the west and will recline with Abraham, and Isaac, and Jacob in the kingdom of heaven. <a href="http://bible.gospelcom.net/cgi-bin/bible?passage=Matt%208:11&amp;version=ESV&amp;interface=print&amp;showfn=yes&amp;showxref">Matt 8:11</a>.

</blockquote>
<p>For in heaven angels have no knowledge at all of Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob. Angels 
there perceive nothing else from those words when read by man than the Lord as regards the Divine and the Divine Human. When man reads about reclining with Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob they perceive nothing 
else than being with the Lord; and when about being in Abraham's bosom nothing else than resting in the Lord. Such wording has been used however because mankind at that time was so far removed from 
things of an internal nature that it neither knew nor wished to know anything other than this, that everything in the Word was to be taken literally. And when the Lord spoke to them in that literal 
manner He did so in order that they might receive faith, and also at the same time in order that the internal sense might be contained within what He said, by means of which mankind was joined to Himself. 
This being so one may see what is meant in the Old Testament Word by 'the God of Jacob' and by 'the Holy One of Israel', namely the Lord Himself. For places where 'the God of Jacob' means the Lord,

naturale constituunt, sicut sunt duo quae rationale, immo quae totum hominem, {1}unum quod est vitae, alterum quod est doctrinae; quod vitae, est voluntatis, quod doctrinae, est intellectus; illud vocatur 
bonum, hoc autem verum; bonum illud est quod repraesentatur per Esavum, verum autem per Jacobum, seu quod idem, bonum vitae veri naturalis est quod repraesentatur per Esavum, et doctrina veri naturalis 
quae per Jacobum: sive dicas bonum vitae veri naturalis, et doctrinam veri naturalis, sive illos qui in iis sunt, idem est, bonum vitae enim, et doctrina veri, non dari potest absque suo subjecto; 
si absque illo, est abstractum quid, quod usque spectat hominem in quo sit; quare per Jacobum hic significantur illi qui in doctrina veri naturalis sunt. [2] Qui in sensu litterae solo manent, per 
Jacobum in Verbo intelligi credunt omnem illum populum qui ex Jacobo, et propterea illi populo tribuunt omnia illa quae de Jacobo et historice et prophetice dicta sunt; sed Verbum est Divinum in eo 
principaliter quod omnia et singula quae ibi non spectent unam gentem seu unum populum, sed universum genus humanum, {2}nempe quod est, quod fuit, et quod erit; et adhuc universalius, {3}nempe regnum 
Domini in caelis; et in (t)supremo sensu Ipsum Dominum; quia ita est, est Verbum Divinum; {4}si modo unam gentem, tunc foret humanum, et nihil plus Divinum ibi, quam quod apud gentem illam esset sanctum 
cultus; quod tale non fuerit apud populum qui Jacob vocatur, cuivis notum esse potest: inde etiam patet quod per `Jacobum' in Verbo non Jacob intelligatur, tum quod per `Israelem' non Israel, {5}quod 
in propheticis paene ubivis, ubi Jacob, etiam Israel nominetur, et nemo scire potest, quid in specie per unum et quid per alterum intelligitur nisi ex sensu qui altius latet, et in se arcana caeli 
recondit. [3] Quod itaque per Jacobum significetur in sensu {6}interno doctrina veri naturalis, seu quod idem, illi qui in ea doctrina sunt, ex quacumque gente sint, et quod in sensu supremo {7}intelligatur 
Dominus, constare potest ab his locis; apud Lucam,           Angelus dixit ad Mariam, Concipies in utero, et paries      Filium, et vocabis nomen Ejus Jesum; Hic erit magnus, et      Filius 
Altissimi vocabitur; et dabit Illi Dominus Deus thronum      Davidis patris Sui, ita ut regnet super domum Jacobi in      saecula, et regni Ipsius non sit finis, i 31-33; </p>
<p>quod hic per `domum Jacobi' 
non gens seu populus Judaicus intellectus sit, quisque videt, regnum enim Domini non fuit super illum populum, sed super omnes in universo qui in fide in Ipsum sunt, et ex fide in charitate; inde constat 
quod per `Jacobum' ab angelo nominatum, non sit populus Jacobi intellectus, consequenter nec alibi; per semen Jacobi, per natos Jacobi, per terram Jacobi, per hereditatem Jacobi, per regem Jacobi, 
per Deum Jacobi, quae toties in Verbo Veteris Testamenti leguntur, non illa sint: [4] similiter se habet cum Israele, ut apud Matthaeum,           Angelus Domini apparuit in somnio Josepho, dicens,  
    Experrectus sume Puerum, et matrem Ipsius, et fuge in      Aegyptum, et esto ibi usque dum dicero; ille experrectus      sumpsit Puerum et matrem Ipsius noctu, et concessit in      Aegyptum; 
ut impleretur quod dictum a propheta, dicente, Ex      Aegypto vocavi filium Meum, ii 13-15; </p>
<p>apud Prophetam ita dicitur,           Cum puer Israel, tunc dilexi illum, et ex Aegypto vocavi      
filium Meum, Hosh. xi 1; </p>
<p>quod hic `Israel' sit Dominus, manifeste patet; (m)et tamen ex sensu litterae non aliud sciri potest quam quod puer Israel sint primi posteri Jacobi, qui in Aegyptum venerunt, 
et dein evocati {8}sunt.(n) Similiter se habet alibi ubi Jacob et Israel nominantur, tametsi hoc non apparet {9}ex sensu litterae; ut apud Esaiam,           Audi Jacob serve mi, et Israel quem elegi, 
sic dixit      Jehovah factor tuus et formator tuus ab utero, juvat te, Ne      time, serve mi Jacob, et Jeshurun quem elegi, quia effundam      aquas super sitientem, et rivos super aridam; effundam  
    spiritum Meum super semen tuum, et benedictionem Meam super      natos tuos; hic dicet, Jehovae ego; et hic vocabit se nomine      Jacobi, et ille scribet manu sua Jehovae, et nomine Israelis  
    cognominabit se, xliv 1-3, 5; </p>
<p>ubi manifeste `Jacob et Israel' pro Domino, ac `semen et nati Jacobi{10}' pro illis qui in fide in Ipsum sunt: [5] in prophetico de filiis Israelis apud Mosen,  
         Josephus sedebit in firmo arcus sui, et corroborabuntur      brachia manuum ejus a manibus fortis Jacobi, inde pastor lapis      Israelis, Gen. xlix 24; </p>
<p>ibi `fortis Jacobus et lapis Israelis' 
etiam manifeste pro Domino: apud Esaiam,           Gloriam Meam alii non dabo, attende Mihi Jacob, et Israel      vocate a Me, Ego idem, Ego primus, etiam Ego novissimus,      xlviii 11, 12; </p>
<p>etiam 
`Jacob et Israel' ibi est Dominus: apud Ezechielem,           Accipiam lignum Josephi, quod in manu Ephraimi et tribuum      Israelis sociorum ejus, et addam eos super illo cum ligno     
 Jehudae, et faciam eos in lignum unum, ut sint unum in manu      Mea:  Ego accipiam filios Israelis ab inter gentes, quo      abiverunt, et congregabo eos e circuitu, et adducam eos super      terram 
suam, et faciam eos in gentem unam in terra, in      montibus Israelis, et rex unus erit omnibus illis in regem, et      non erunt amplius duae gentes, et non dividentur amplius in      dua regna 
iterum...  Servus Meus David rex super eos, et      pastor unus erit omnibus illis;...tunc habitabunt super terra,      quam dedi servo Meo Jacobo, in qua habitarunt patres vestri; </p>
<p>     habitabunt 
super ea, illi et filii illorum, et filii filiorum      illorum, usque in aeternitatem; David servus Meus princeps      illis in aeternum: pangam illis foedus pacis, foedus      aeternitatis erit 
cum illis; dabo illos, et multiplicabo      illos, et ponam sanctuarium Meum in medio eorum in aeternum: </p>
<p>     sic erit habitaculum Meum apud illos, et ero illis in Deum, et      illi erunt Mihi in 
populum, ut cognoscant gentes, quod Ego      Jehovah sanctificem Israelem, in esse sanctuarium Meum in      medio eorum in aeternum, xxxvii 19, 21, 22, 24-28; </p>
<p>hic iterum manifeste patet quod per 
`Josephum,' per `Ephraimum,' per `Jehudam,' per `Israelem,' per `Jacobum,' perque `Davidem' non intelligantur illi, sed quod in supremo sensu Divine spiritualia quae in Domino, et quae Domini in regno 
et in Ecclesia Ipsius; quod David non erit rex illis et princeps in aeternum, ut dicitur, quisque scire potest, sed quod per Davidem intelligatur Dominus, n. 1888; etiam sciri potest quod Israel non 
{11}congregabitur quo dispersus est, et quod illi non sanctificabuntur, et sanctuarium in medio eorum ponetur in aeternum, ut dicitur, sed quod illi qui per `Israelem' in sensu repraesentativo significantur, 
qui quod sint omnes fideles, notum est: [6] (m)apud Micham,           Colligendo colligam Jacobum omnem te, congregando      congregabo reliquias Israelis, una ponam eum sicut oves      Bozrae, 
ii 12,(n) similiter: apud Esaiam,           Venturos radicabit Jacob, efflorescet et florebit Israel,      et implebuntur facies orbis proventu, xxvii 6; </p>
<p>etiam similiter: apud eundem,       
    Sic dixit Jehovah ad domum Jacobi, Qui redemit Abrahamum,      Non jam pudefiet Jacobus, et non jam facies ejus pallescent,      quia in videndo illo natos suos, opus manuum Mearum, in medio   
   ejus sanctificabunt nomen Meum, et sanctificabunt Sanctum      Jacobi, et Deum Israelis timebunt, et scient errantes spiritu      intelligentiam, xxix 22-24: </p>
<p>apud eundem,           Dixit Jehovah 
uncto suo {12}Koresho, cujus apprehendi      dextram, ad subjiciendum coram ipso gentes, et lumbos regum      solvam, ad aperiendum coram ipso januas, et portae non      claudantur: Ego ante te ibo, 
et tortuosa rectificabo, januas      aeris confringam, et vectes ferri concidam, dabo tibi      thesauros latebrarum, et occultas opes absconditorum, ut      cognoscas quod Ego Jehovah, Qui vocatus 
nomine tuo Deus      Israelis, propter servum Meum Jacobum, et Israelem electum      Meum; vocavi te nomine tuo, cognominavi te cum non nosceres      Me, (x)xlv 1-4; </p>
<p>ubi etiam manifeste de Domino: 
apud Micham,           In extremitate dierum, erit mons domus Jehovae      constitutus in caput montium,...ibunt gentes multae, et      dicent, Ite et ascendamus ad montem Jehovae, et ad domum 
Dei      Jacobi, ut doceat nos de viis Suis, et ibimus in semitis      Ipsius, nam e Zione exibit doctrina, et verbum Jehovae e      Hierosolyma, iv 1, 2: </p>
<p>apud Davidem,           Amat Jehovah portas 
Zionis prae omnibus habitaculis      Jacobi, gloriosa praedicanda in te civitas Dei, Ps. lxxxvii 1-3: </p>
<p>apud Jeremiam,           Servient Jehovae Deo suo, et Davidi regi suo, quem      excitabo 
eis; et tu ne timeas serve Mi Jacob, et ne terrearis      Israel, quia ecce Ego servans te e longinquo, xxx 9, 10: </p>
<p>apud Esaiam,           Attendite insulae ad me, et auscultate populi e      longinquo, 
Jehovah ab utero vocavit me, e visceribus matris      meae meminit nominis mei, et dixit mihi, Servus meus tu      Israel, in quo gloriosus reddar, xlix 1, 3: </p>
<p>apud eundem,           Tunc deliciaberis 
super Jehovah, et eveham te in excelsa      terrae, et cibabo te hereditate Jacobi, lviii 14: </p>
<p>apud eundem,           Producam ex Jacobo semen, et ex Jehuda heredem montium      Meorum, 
ut possideant eum electi Mei, et servi Mei habitent      ibi, lxv 9. [7] In omnibus illis locis per `Jacobum et Israelem' in sensu supremo intelligitur Dominus, et in sensu repraesentativo regnum Domini 
spirituale, et Ecclesia quae ex doctrina veri et vita boni Ecclesia est, per `Jacobum' illi qui in externis illius Ecclesiae sunt, et per `Israelem' qui in internis. Ex his et perpluribus aliis 
locis constare potest quod per `Jacobum' nullibi intellectus sit Jacob, nec per `Israelem' Israel, sicut nec per `{13}Jishakum' Jishak, et per `Abrahamum' Abraham, ubi nominantur, ut apud Matthaeum,  
         Multi ab oriente et occidente venient, et accumbent cum      Abrahamo, et Jishako, et Jacobo, in regno caelorum, viii 11: </p>
<p>apud Lucam,           Videbitis Abrahamum, Jishakum et Jacobum, et 
omnes      prophetas in regno Dei, xiii 28: </p>
<p>et apud eundem,           Lazarus sublatus ab angelis in sinum Abrahami, xvi 22; </p>
<p>ignorant enim Abrahamum, Jishakum et Jacobum in caelo, {14}et qui ibi, 
non aliud per illa verba cum ab homine leguntur, percipiunt quam Dominum quoad Divinum et Divinum Humanum, et cum Abrahamo, Jishako et Jacobo accumbere, quam esse cum Domino, et in Abrahami sinu esse, 
quam esse in Domino; sed dictum est ita, quia homo tunc temporis tam remotus erat ab internis ut non sciret aliud, nec scire vellet aliud, quam quod {15}omnia in Verbo se haberent secundum litteram, 
et cum secundum litteram cum illis locutus est Dominus, quod fidem reciperent, et quoque quod tunc internus sensus inesset, per quem conjunctio hominis cum Se. Quia ita est, constare potest quid in 
Verbo Veteris Testamenti significatur per `Deum Jacobi,' et per `Sanctum Israelis,' quod nempe Ipse Dominus; quod `Deus Jacobi' sit Dominus, videatur 2 Sam. xxiii 1; Esai. ii 3; xli 21; Mich. iv 2; Ps. 
xx 1; xlvi 7; lxxv 9; lxxvi 6; lxxxi 1, 4; lxxxiv 8; xciv 7; cxiv 7; cxxxii 2; cxlvi (x)5. Quod Sanctus Israelis sit Dominus, Esai. i 4; v 19, 24; x 20; xii 6; xvii 7; xxix 19; xxx 11, 12, 15; xxxi 
1; xxxvii 23; xli 14, 16, 20; xliii 3, 14; xlv 11; xlvii 4; xlviii 17; xlix 7; liv 5; lv 5; lx 9, 14; Jer. l 29; Ezech. xxxix 7; Ps. lxxi 22; (x)lxxviii 41; lxxxix 18. @1 i nempe$  @2 quod in terris,
