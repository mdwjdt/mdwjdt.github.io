<h3 align="center" class="ired">属天的奥秘 第5344节</h3>
<h4 align="center"></h4><p><strong>5344.</strong>“就是城周围的，都存放在城中间”表它将最先存在于外层属世层中的事物储存在内层属世层的内层。这从“周围”和“中间”的含义清楚可知：“周围”是指外面的事物，因而是指外层属世层中的事物；“中间”是指里面的事物（参看<a href="1074.htm">1074</a>，<a href="2940.htm">2940</a>，<a href="2973.htm">2973</a>节），因而是指内层属世层中的事物。“在城中间”之所以表示在内层属世层的内层，是因为“城”表示内层（<a href="5297.htm">5297</a>，<a href="5342.htm">5342</a>节）。内层属世层的内层部分就是它里面那些被称为属灵的部分，它里面的属灵部分就是那些属于天堂之光，因而能光照那里属于尘世之光、严格来说被称为属世的部分的部分。与良善联结的真理正是被储存在了这内层属世层的属灵部分中。<br />那里的属灵部分就是那对应于第二层天堂的天使社群的，人通过他的余剩与该天堂进行交流。这就是当人正在重生时打开、当人不让自己重生时关闭的那层天堂；因为余剩（即被储存在内层的真理与良善）无非是与属于那层天堂的社群的对应。</p>

<p align="center"><b>Potts(1905-1910) 5344</b></p><p><b>5344.</b>
That which was round about it he put in the midst thereof. That this signifies that the things previously in the exterior natural it stored up in the interiors of the interior natural, is evident from 
the signification of "round about," as being the things outside, thus which were in the exterior natural; and from the signification of the "midst," as being the things within (see n. 1074, 2940, 2973), 
thus which were in the interior natural. That "in the midst thereof," or of the city, denotes in the interiors of the interior natural, is because the interiors are signified by a "city" (n. 5297, 
5342). The interior things of the interior natural are those in it called spiritual, and the spiritual things therein are those which are from the light of heaven, from which light are illumined the 
things therein which are from the light of the world, and which are properly called natural; in the spiritual things therein are stored up truths adjoined to good. The spiritual things therein are those 
which correspond to the angelic societies in the second heaven, with which heaven man communicates by means of remains. This is the heaven that is opened when man is being regenerated, and is closed 
when he does not suffer himself to be regenerated; for remains-or truths and goods stored up in the interiors-are nothing else than correspondences with the societies of that heaven. </p>

<p align="center"><b>Elliott(1983-1999) 5344</b></p><p><b>5344.</b>
'Which was round about it he laid up in the midst of it' means that what existed first in the exterior natural was stored away by it in the interior parts of the interior natural. This is clear from 
the meaning of 'round about' as things on the outside and so in the exterior natural; and from the meaning of 'the midst' as things on the inside, dealt with in <a href="1074.htm">1074</a>, <a href="2940.htm">2940</a>, <a href="2973.htm">2973</a>, and so in the interior 
natural. The reason 'in the midst of it (the city)' means in the interior parts of the interior natural is that 'a city' means the interior parts, <a href="5297.htm">5297</a>, <a href="5342.htm">5342</a>. The interior parts of the interior natural 
are those parts in it which are called spiritual ones, and the spiritual parts in it are those parts which belong to the light of heaven and are therefore able to shed light on the parts there which 
belong to the light of the world, which strictly speaking are called natural ones. It is in the spiritual parts of the interior natural that the truths linked to good have been stored away. </p>
<p></p>
<p><b>[2]</b>
Those spiritual parts there are what correspond to the angelic communities in the second heaven, and a person is in communication with this heaven through his remnants. This heaven is the one that is 
opened when a person is being regenerated, and it is the one that is shut when a person does not allow himself to be regenerated. For remnants - that is, truths and forms of good stored away in interior 
parts - are nothing else than correspondences with the communities belonging to that heaven. </p>

</p><b>5344.</b>
`Quae circumcirca illam, dedit in medio illius': quod significet quae prius in exteriore naturali recondit in interioribus interioris naturalis, constat ex significatione `circumcirca' quod sint quae 
extra, ita quae in exteriore naturali; et ex significatione `medii' quod sint quae intra, de qua n. 1074, 2940, 2973, ita quae in interiore naturali; quod `in medio illius' seu urbis sit in interioribus 
{1}interioris naturalis, est quia per `urbem' significantur interiora, n. 5297, 5342. Interiora interioris naturalis sunt illa ibi quae spiritualia vocantur, et spiritualia ibi sunt quae a luce caeli 
sunt, ex qua illuminantur illa ibi quae a luce mundi sunt, quae proprie naturalia dicuntur; in spiritualibus ibi recondita sunt vera bono adjuncta; [2] spiritualia ibi sunt quae correspondent societatibus 
angelicis quae in secundo caelo, cum hoc caelo communicat homo per reliquias; hoc caelum est quod aperitur cum homo regeneratur, et hoc caelum est quod clauditur cum homo non patitur se regenerari; 
reliquiae enim seu vera et bona in interioribus recondita non sunt aliud quam correspondentiae cum societatibus illius caeli. @1 naturalibus interioribus$ </p>
