<h3 align="center" class="ired">属天的奥秘 第1126节</h3>
<h4 align="center"></h4><p><strong>1126.</strong>我面前出现一个狭小房间，门开了，一个高个子映入眼帘，身穿亮白的衣服。我纳闷他是谁。他们说，这个穿白衣的人表那些叫做挪亚的人，或古教会，即洪水后的教会最早期的成员。他们还说，这些人之所以展现出这种形象，是因为他们人数稀少。</p>

<p><strong>[NCE]1126.</strong> I saw a narrow room, and through an open door there came into view a tall man dressed in white — a very intense white. I wondered who he was. They said that a man in white symbolized those who were referred to as Noah, or in other words, those who were the very first people in the ancient church — the church that followed the Flood. Those people were represented this way, they said, because their numbers were small. </p>

There appeared to me a narrow room; and the door being opened a tall man came into view, clothed in white, the whiteness being intense. I wondered who he was, and was told that a man clothed in white 
signified those who were called "Noah," who were the first of all of the Ancient Church, which was the church after the flood; and that they were thus represented because they were few. </p>

A narrow room appeared to me, and when the door had been opened a tall man came into view, clothed in white, a brilliant white. I wondered who he might be. They said that the man clothed in white meant 
those called Noah, or earliest members of the Ancient Church, the Church following the Flood. They said that those people were represented in this way because they were few in number. </p>

Visum mihi fuit conclave angustum, et aperta janua in conspectum venit vir longus, indutus albo, albedo erat intensa; miratus quinam esset; dicebant quod vir albo indutus significaret eos qui appellati 
sunt 'Noahus' seu qui omnium primi fuerunt ab Ecclesia Antiqua, quae est Ecclesia post diluvium, et quod ita repraesentarentur quia pauci fuerunt. </p>
