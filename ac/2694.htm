<h3 align="center" class="ired">属天的奥秘 第2694节</h3>
<h4 align="center"></h4><p><strong>2694.</strong>“不要害怕，因为孩子在那里所发的声音，神已经听见了”表相助的希望。这从“不要害怕”和“听见孩子的声音”的含义清楚可知：“不要害怕”是指不要绝望，因为一旦害怕被除去，希望就会到来；“听见孩子的声音”是指帮助，如前所述（<a href="2691.htm">2691</a>节），那里有同样的话。前几节论述的主题是那些正被改造、变得属灵之人所经历的荒凉状态，现在论述的主题则是他们的恢复，此处论述的是他们的安慰和相助的希望。<br />那些正被改造的人会被带入不知道任何真理，即荒凉，甚至悲伤绝望的状态。就在这时，他们才第一次收到主的安慰和帮助。这一事实如今不为人知，因为很少有人被改造。那些能被改造的人就被带入这种状态，即便不是在今世，也会在来世被带入。这种状态在来世是众所周知的，被称为消磨或荒凉，这在第一卷有所说明（参看<a href="1109.htm">1109</a>节）。那些经历这种消磨或荒凉的人甚至被带入绝望的状态，并且当处于这种状态时，他们会收到主的安慰和帮助，最终从这种状态中被带出来，然后进入天堂。在那里，他们在众天使当中可以说重新被教导信之良善与真理。他们经历这种消磨或荒凉的原因主要是为了使他们通过自己的东西所深信不疑的事能够瓦解（参看<a href="2682.htm">2682</a>节）；也为了让他们接受对良善与真理的直觉，若那些源于他们自己的东西的谬念不能仿佛被软化，他们就无法接受这种直觉。这种变化就是由焦虑悲伤，甚至绝望的状态产生的。若不经历丧失良善、幸福和快乐的状态，没有人，哪怕感觉最敏锐的人能觉察到何为良善，甚至何为幸福快乐。人正是通过这种经历获得一种直觉的气场，并且他获得这种气场的程度和他经历相反状态的程度一样。直觉的气场和它所延伸的范围取决于这两种相反状态的对照。这些就是消磨或荒凉的原因。<br />下面举例说明这个问题。对那些将一切归给自己的智谋，很少或根本不归给圣治的人来说，哪怕举出成千上万个证据来证明圣治是普遍的，而普遍是因为它存在于最小事物中；甚至头上掉下来的一根头发丝（即凡存在的任何事物，无论多么小）都是被预见并相应提供的，他们对自己智谋的想法仍旧不会改变，除了他们因这类证据而感到信服的那一瞬间之外。事实上，若通过活生生的经历向他们证明这个问题，那么，就在他们亲眼见证这些经历，或参与其中的那一刻，他们有可能承认事实的确如此，但过后不久，他们又回到以前的观点中。这种经历对人的思维有某种短暂效应，但对其情感不起作用。若情感不崩溃，思维仍保持在以前的状态中，因为思维通过情感拥有自己的信念和生命。但是，当焦虑悲伤由于他们自己的无助而临到他们，甚至这些感觉到了绝望的地步时，他们的信念就会崩塌，他们的状态也会被改变。这时，他们被引入这样的信念中：即他们凭自己的力量什么也做不了，一切力量、智谋、聪明和智慧皆来自主。那些以为信仰来自他们自己，良善也来自他们自己的人也一样。<br />再举一例说明这个问题。若人们坚信，一旦称义，他们就再有任何邪恶，凡邪恶皆被完全抹掉、毁灭，因此他们是纯净的，那么，成千上万个证据就会用来向他们清楚证明：没有任何事物被抹掉或毁灭，主将那些在世时过着良善生活的人从恶中拦阻，并保守在善中，这种人被主从恶中拦阻并保守在善中是有可能的。除了这些证据外，他们还能通过经历确信，他们凭自己无非是恶，事实上，是最污秽的大量邪恶。但尽管有所有这些证据和经历，他们仍不从自己的观点和信念中退出。不过，当他们被带入一种特定状态，好叫他们发觉自己里面的地狱，并且觉察得如此清晰以致他们对自己得救的可能性感到绝望时，这种坚定信念才第一次崩塌，连同它一起崩塌的，还有他们的骄傲、与自己相比对其他所有人的蔑视，以及认为唯有他们才能得救的那种自大。他们能被带入对信仰的真正承认中，不仅承认一切善皆来自主，还承认万事万物皆因主的怜悯而存在，最终被带入在主面前发自内心的谦卑中。若不承认自我的这种真正品质，这是不可能的事。由此明显可知，那些正被改造或变得属灵之人为何被带入前几节所论述的那种消磨或荒凉的状态中；并且他们处于这种状态，甚至感到绝望时，才第一次收到主的安慰和帮助。</p>

<p align="center"><b>Potts(1905-1910) 2694</b></p><p><b>2694.</b>
Fear not, for God hath heard the voice of the child where he is. That this signifies the hope of help, is evident from the signification of "fear not," as being not to despair; for when fear is taken 
away, hope is present; and from the signification of "hearing the voice of the child," as being help (see above, n. 2691, where the words are similar). In the verses which precede, the state of desolation 
in which those are who are being reformed and are becoming spiritual, is treated of; now the subject is their being restored, and here their comfort and hope of help. [2] That they who are being 
reformed are reduced into ignorance of truth, or desolation, even to grief and despair, and that they then for the first time have comfort and help from the Lord, is unknown at this day, for the reason 
that few are reformed. They who are such that they can be reformed are brought into this state, if not in the life of the body, nevertheless in the other life, where this state is well known, and 
is called vastation or desolation, concerning which there has been some mention in volume 1 (where also see n. 1109). They who are in such vastation or desolation are reduced even to despair; and when 
they are in this state they then receive comfort and help from the Lord, and are at length taken away into heaven, where they are instructed among the angels as it were anew in the goods and truths of 
faith. The reason of this vastation and desolation is chiefly that the persuasive which they have conceived from what is their own may be broken (see n. 2682); and that they may also receive the perception 
of good and truth, which they cannot receive until the persuasive which is from their own has been as it were softened.  This is effected by the state of anxiety and grief even to despair. What 
is good, nay, what is blessed and happy, no one can perceive with an exquisite sense unless he has been in a state of what is not good, not blessed, and not happy. From this he acquires a sphere of 
perception, and this in the degree in which he has been in the opposite state. The sphere of perception and the extension of its limits arise from the realizing of contrasts. These are causes of vastation 
or desolation, besides many others. [3] But take examples for illustration. If to those who ascribe all things to their own prudence and little or nothing to Divine Providence, it be proved by 
thousands of reasons that the Divine Providence is universal, and this because it is in the most minute particulars; and that not even a hair falls from the head (that is, nothing happens however small) 
which is not foreseen and provided accordingly, nevertheless their state of thought about their own prudence is not changed by it, except at the very moment when they find themselves convinced by the 
reasons. Nay, if the same thing were attested to them by living experiences; just at the moment when they see the experiences, or are in them, they may confess that it is so; but after the lapse of 
a few moments they return to their former state of opinion. Such things have some momentary effect upon the thought, but not upon the affection; and unless the affection is broken, the thought remains 
in its own state; for the thought has its belief and its life from the affection. But when anxiety and grief are induced upon them by the fact of their own helplessness, and this even to despair, their 
persuasive is broken, and their state is changed; and then they can be led into the belief that they can do nothing of themselves, but that all power, prudence, intelligence, and wisdom are from the 
Lord. The case is similar with those who believe that faith is from themselves, and that good is from themselves. [4] Take another example for illustration: If to those who have conceived the persuasion 
that when justified there is no longer any evil in them, but it is completely wiped away and blotted out, and thus they are pure-if to these it be made clear by thousands of reasons that nothing 
is wiped away or blotted out, but that they are kept back from evil and held in good by the Lord (that is to say those who are of such a character that from the life of good in which they had been in 
the world this is possible to them); and if moreover they be convinced by experience that of themselves they are nothing but evil, and indeed are most impure heaps of evils-after all they will not recede 
from the belief of their opinion. But when they are reduced to such a state that they perceive hell in themselves, and this to such a degree as to despair of ever being able to be saved, then for 
the first time that persuasive is broken, and with it their pride, and their contempt of others in comparison with themselves, and also the arrogance that they are the only ones who are saved; and they 
can be led into the true confession of faith, not only that all good is from the Lord, but also that all things are of His mercy; and at length into humiliation of heart before the Lord, which is 
not possible without the acknowledgment of the true character of self. Hence now it is manifest why they who are being reformed, or are becoming spiritual, are reduced into the state of vastation or desolation 
treated of in the verses which precede; and that when they are in that state even to despair, they then for the first time receive comfort and help from the Lord. </p>

<p align="center"><b>Elliott(1983-1999) 2694</b></p><p><b>2694.</b>
'Do not be afraid, for God has heard the boy's voice where he is' means the hope of help. This is clear from the meaning of 'do not be afraid' as not despairing, for once fear is removed hope is at hand; 
and from the meaning of 'hearing the boy's voice' as help, dealt with above in <a href="2691.htm">2691</a>, where similar words occur. The subject in previous verses has been the state of desolation which those people 
experience who are being reformed and becoming spiritual. But now the subject is the restoration of them, and here their comfort and hope of help. </p>
<p></p>
<p><b>[2]</b>
 The fact that those who are being reformed are 
brought into a state of not knowing any truth, that is, into a state of desolation, insomuch that they experience grief and despair, and that at this point for the first time they receive comfort and 
help from the Lord, is something that is not known at the present day for the reason that few are being reformed. Those who are such that they are able to be reformed are brought into this state, if 
not during this life then in the next, where that state is very well known and is called vastation or desolation, regarding which something has been said in Volume One, where also see <a href="1109.htm">1109</a>. Those who 
experience such vastation or desolation are brought to the point of despair, and when in that state they receive comfort and help from the Lord, and at length are taken away out of that state into heaven, 
where in the presence of angels they are taught so to speak anew the goods and truths of faith. The primary reason why they undergo vastation or desolation is so that the things of which they are 
firmly persuaded, originating in what is properly their own, may crumble, see <a href="2682.htm">2682</a>, and also that they may receive the perception of good and truth, which perception they are not able to receive until 
those false persuasions originating in what is their own are so to speak softened. And it is the state of distress and grief even to the point of despair that effects this change. What good is, and 
indeed what blessedness and happiness are, nobody with even the sharpest mind is able to perceive unless he has experienced the state of being deprived of good, blessedness, and happiness. It is from 
this experience that he acquires a sphere of perception; and he acquires it to the same degree that he has experienced the contrary state, for the sphere of perception and how far it extends are determined 
by his experience of the two contrary states. These, in addition to many others, are the reasons for vastation or desolation. Let the following examples illustrate the matter. </p>
<p></p>
<p><b>[3]</b>
 Take those 
people who attribute everything to their own prudence, and little or nothing to Divine Providence. Even if thousands of reasons are produced to prove that Divine Providence is universal, but universal 
because it exists in every least thing, and that not even a hair falls from the head - that is, nothing however small exists that has not been foreseen and that has not been provided accordingly - their 
state of thought regarding their own prudence would remain unaltered, except for the brief moment when they feel convinced by such arguments. Indeed if the same matter were proved to them by actual 
experiences, they would while witnessing or taking part in such experiences acknowledge the truth of it, but after a short while they would revert to their previous outlook. Such experiences have a 
fleeting effect on people's thought but not on their affection, and unless the affection is broken down the thought remains in its same state as before; for the thought receives its conviction and its 
life from the affection. But when the feelings of distress and grief enter into them because they have no power at all that is their own to do anything, and those feelings reach the point of despair, 
their firm persuasion is broken down and their state altered. In this case they can be brought to a conviction that they have no power that is their own to do anything, and that all power, prudence, 
intelligence and wisdom originate in the Lord. The same is true of people who believe that their faith is self-derived and their good self-derived. </p>
<p></p>
<p><b>[4]</b>
 Let a further example illustrate the matter. 
Take those who have become firmly persuaded that once they have been made righteous no evil resides with them any longer, but has been completely wiped away and destroyed, and thus that they are pure. 
Thousands of arguments could be used to make it clear to them that nothing is wiped away or destroyed, but that those people are withheld from evil and maintained in good by the Lord who from the life 
of good which they have led in the world are such that they can be withheld from evil and maintained in good by Him. In addition to these arguments they could be convinced from experiences that they 
are of themselves nothing but evil, indeed that they are nothing but utterly filthy masses of evil. But in spite of all those arguments and experiences they would still not depart from their opinion 
and belief. But when they are brought into a particular state in order that they may perceive hell within themselves, and perceiving this so clearly as to despair of the possibility of their own salvation, 
that firm persuasion is for the first time broken down and with it their pride and their contempt for all others in comparison with themselves, and also their arrogant assumption that they are the 
only ones who are saved. They can now be brought into a true confession of faith, not merely to the confession that all good comes from the Lord but also that all things exist because of His mercy; 
and at length they can be brought into humility of heart before the Lord, the existence of which is impossible without acknowledgement of what they are in themselves. From this it is now evident why 
those who are being reformed or becoming spiritual are brought into the state of vastation or desolation dealt with in the verses previous to this, and how, when experiencing this state even to the point 
of despair, they for the first time receive comfort and help from the Lord. </p>

{1}  `Ne timeas, quia audivit Deus vocem pueri, in quo ille ibi': quod significet spem auxilii, constat a significatione `ne timeas' quod sit non desperare, sublato enim timore spes adest; et a significatione 
`audire vocem pueri' quod sit auxilium, de qua supra n. 2691, ubi similia verba.  Actum est in versibus qui praecedunt, de statu desolationis, in quo illi qui reformantur ac fiunt spirituales; 
nunc agitur de restitutione eorum, hic de solatio et spe auxilii.  [2] Quod in ignorantiam veri seu desolationem, usque ad dolorem et desperationem, redigantur illi qui reformantur, et quod tunc primum 
iis solatium et auxilium a Domino, hodie ignotum est, ex causa quia pauci reformantur; qui tales sunt ut reformari queant, si non in vita corporis, usque in altera, in statum hunc perducuntur, ubi 
ille notissimus est et vocatur `vastatio seu desolatio,' de qua aliquid in Parte Prima, ubi etiam videatur n. 1109; qui in tali vastatione seu desolatione sunt, rediguntur usque ad desperationem, et 
cum in hoc statu sunt, tunc accipiunt solatium et auxilium a Domino, et tandem auferuntur inde in caelum, ubi inter angelos instruuntur quasi e novo in bonis et veris fidei: causa vastationis et {2} 
desolationis hujus est praecipue ut frangatur persuasivum quod ex proprio captarunt, videatur n. 2682; tum etiam ut perceptionem boni et veri accipiant, quam accipere nequeunt antequam persuasivum quod 
ex proprio, quasi emollitum sit; status anxietatis et doloris usque ad desperationem facit hoc; quid bonum, immo quid beatum et felix, nemo sensu exquisito percipere potest nisi in statu non boni, non 
beati, et non felicis fuerit; ex hoc capit perceptionis sphaeram; et hoc in eo gradu in quo fuit in statu opposito, ex relativis actualiter formatis fit sphaera perceptionis et extensio limitum ejus; 
hae causae vastationis seu desolationis sunt, praeter plures alias: (o)sed sint illustrationi exempla.  [3] Qui suae prudentiae omnia tribuunt, et parum vel nihil Providentiae Divinae, illi si vel 
mille et mille rationibus evincerentur quod Providentia Divina sit universalis, sed universalis inde quia est in singularissimis, (m)et quod ne quidem capillus de capite decidat, hoc est, non tam minimum 
detur quod non praevisum et secundum id provisum,(n) usque tamen status eorum cogitationis de propria prudentia non inde mutatur, nisi solum illo momento cum convictos se rationibus appercipiunt; 
immo si idem testatum iis fieret per vivas experientias, tunc cum experientias vident aut in illis sunt, fatentur quod ita sit, sed praeterlapsis aliquibus momentis redeunt ad eundem statum opinionis; 
talia aliquem momentaneum effectum habent in cogitationem, non autem in affectionem, et nisi affectio frangitur, manet cogitatio in suo statu, nam cogitatio suam fidem {3} et suam vitam habet ab affectione; 
at cum inducitur (c)iis anxietas et dolor ex eo quod nihil usquam (c)ex se possint, et hoc usque ad desperationem, tunc frangitur persuasivum, et mutatur status; et tunc in illam fidem induci 
possunt quod nihil possint ex se, sed quod omnis potentia, prudentia, intelligentia et sapientia sit a Domino: similiter se habet cum illis qui credunt quod fides ab ipsis, quodque {4} bonum ab ipsis. 
 [4] Sit adhuc illustrationi exemplum: qui hoc persuasivum captarunt quod cum justificati, non amplius aliquod malum apud eos sit, sed quod plane abstersum (c)et deletum sit, et sic quod puri sint; illi 
si vel per millia rationum illustrarentur, quod nihil abstergatur seu deleatur, sed quod {5} a malo detineantur et in bono teneatur a Domino nihil qui tales sunt a vita boni in qua fuerunt in mundo, 
ut possint, et adhuc si convincerentur per experientias, quod sint a se nihil nisi malum, immo quod impurissimae congeries malorum, usque non recedunt a fide opinionis suae; at vero cum reducuntur, 
ad {6} illum statum ut percipiant in se infernum, et hoc eo usque ut desperent quod usquam salvari possint, tunc primum frangitur persuasivum illud, et cum illo fastus, et contemptus aliorum prae se, 
tum arrogantia quod soli sint qui salvantur, ac induci possunt in veram confessionem fidei, non modo quod omne bonum sit a Domino, sed etiam quod omnia sint misericordiae Ipsius; et tandem in humiliationem 
cordis coram Domino, quae absque agnitione sui non dabilis est.  Exinde nunc patet cur illi qui reformantur aut spirituales fiunt, rediguntur in statum vastationis seu desolationis, de quo in versibus 
qui praecedunt; et quod cum in statu illo usque ad desperationem sunt, tunc primum iis solatium et auxilium a Domino. 	@1 A has two versions, the earlier is unfinished but not deleted (see Appendix
