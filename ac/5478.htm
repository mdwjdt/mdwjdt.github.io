<h3 align="center" class="ired">属天的奥秘 第5478节</h3>
<h4 align="center"></h4><p><strong>5478.</strong>“因为在他们之间有传译官”表这时属灵事物以完全不同的方式被理解。这从“在他们之间有传译官”的含义清楚可知，“在他们之间有传译官”是指属灵事物以不同的方式被理解。因为传译官（即翻译或译员）将一个人的语言翻译成另一人的语言，从而将这个人的意思阐述出来，使另一个人明白。这解释了为何“在他们之间有传译官”表示这时属灵事物被那些拥有尚未通过良善与内在人联结的教会真理之人以完全不同的方式来理解。那些处于良善的人，也就是在他们中间这些真理已经与良善联结的人对于教会真理的理解，完全不同于那些未处于良善之人的；这一事实的确就像一个悖论，但尽管如此，它仍是真理。事实上，那些处于良善的人以属灵的方式理解真理，因为这些人处于属灵之光；而那些未处于良善的人却以属世的方式理解真理，因为这些人处于属世之光。因此，那些处于良善的人不断将真理联结到他们早已拥有的真理上；而那些未处于良善的人则将众多幻觉，以及虚假联结到他们所拥有的真理上。原因在于，那些处于良善之人当中的真理会延伸至天堂；而那些未处于良善之人当中的真理则不会延伸至天堂。因此，那些处于良善之人当中的真理被填充、丰满；而那些未处于良善之人当中的真理则几近空虚。只要活在世人，人是看不见这种丰满和这种空虚的；但天使看得见。人若知道有多少天堂存在于与良善联结的真理里面，对于信仰就会有完全不同的概念。</p>

For there was an interpreter between them. That this signifies that then spiritual things are apprehended quite differently, is evident from the signification of there being "an interpreter between them," 
as being that the spiritual things are apprehended differently; for an interpreter translates the language of one into the language of another, and thus sets forth the meaning of the one to the 
apprehension of the other. Hence it is that by there being "an interpreter between them" is signified that then spiritual things are apprehended quite differently by those who are in the truths of the 
church not yet conjoined by means of good with the internal man. That the truths of the church are apprehended by those who are in good (that is those with whom these truths are conjoined with good) 
quite differently from what they are by those who are not in good, seems indeed like a paradox, but still it is the truth. For truths are spiritually apprehended by those who are in good, because these 
persons are in spiritual light; but they are apprehended naturally by those who are not in good, because these are in natural light. Hence truths on the part of those who are in good have truths continually 
conjoined with them; but on the part of those who are not in good they have conjoined with them very many fallacies, and also falsities. The reason of this is that truths with those who are in 
good extend themselves into heaven; while truths with those who are not in good do not extend themselves into heaven. Hence truths with those who are in good are full, but with those who are not in 
good they are nearly empty. This fullness and this emptiness are not apparent to man so long as he lives in the world, but they appear to the angels. Did man but know how much of heaven there is in truths 
conjoined with good, he would feel very differently about faith. </p>

'Because the interpreter was between them' means that at this time spiritual things are understood in a completely different manner. This is clear from the meaning of 'the interpreter was between them' 
as the fact that spiritual things are understood in a different manner. For an interpreter translates the language of one person into the language of another, and so enables the perceptions in the 
one person's mind to be understood by another person. This explains why 'the interpreter was between them' means that at that time spiritual things are understood in a completely different manner, that 
is, by those in possession of truths known to the Church which have not yet been joined through good to the internal man. The fact that the truths known to the Church are understood by those governed 
by good - that is among those with whom such truths have been joined to good - in a manner completely different from that in which those who are not governed by good understand them does indeed seem 
to be a paradox; but for all that, it is the truth. For truths are understood in a spiritual manner by those who are governed by good because such people dwell in spiritual light, whereas truths are 
understood in a natural manner by those who are not governed by good because they dwell in natural light. Consequently those who are governed by good are constantly linking truths to the truths they already 
have, whereas those who are not governed by good link very many illusions as well as falsities to the truths they have. The reason for this is that the truths present with people governed by good 
reach into heaven, whereas the truths present with those who are not governed by good do not reach into heaven. Consequently the truths present with those governed by good are filled out, whereas the 
ones present with those who are not governed by good are virtually empty. That fullness or emptiness is not seen by man as long as he lives in the world; but the angels see it. If man knew how much 
of heaven existed within truths that have been joined to good he would have a completely different conception of faith. </p>

</p><b>5478.</b>
`Quia interpres inter illos': quod significet quod tunc spiritualia prorsus aliter capiantur, constat ex significatione `interpretis inter illos' quod sit quod spiritualia aliter capiantur, interpres 
enim linguam unius transfert in linguam alterius, ita alterius sensa exponit ad captum alterius; inde est quod per `interpretem inter illos' significetur quod tunc spiritualia prorsus aliter capiantur, 
nempe ab illis qui sunt in Ecclesiae veris nondum per bonum conjunctis interno homini. Quod vera Ecclesiae prorsus aliter capiantur ab illis qui in bono sunt, hoc est, apud quos vera illa conjuncta 
sunt bono, quam ab illis qui non in bono sunt, hoc apparet quidem sicut paradoxon sed usque est verum; vera enim ab illis qui in bono sunt, spiritualiter capiuntur quia in spirituali luce sunt; at vera 
ab illis qui non in bono sunt, naturaliter capiuntur quia in naturali luce sunt; inde vera ab illis qui in bono sunt, sibi conjuncta habent vera continue, sed ab illis qui non in bono sunt, sibi conjuncta 
habent perplura fallacia et quoque falsa; causa est quia vera apud illos qui in bono sunt, se extendunt in caelum, at vera apud illos qui non in bono sunt, se non extendunt in caelum; sunt inde 
vera apud illos qui in bono sunt, plena, at apud illos qui non in bono sunt, paene vacua; plenitudo illa et vacuitas illa non apparent coram homine quamdiu in mundo vivit, at coram angelis; si homo 
sciret quantum caeleste (t)esset in veris conjunctis bono, prorsus aliter de fide sentiret.  </p>
