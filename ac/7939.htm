<h3 align="center" class="ired">属天的奥秘 第7939节</h3>
<h4 align="center"></h4><p><strong>7939.</strong>“祂就越过以色列人的房屋”表诅咒远离他们被主所保守在的良善。这从“耶和华越过”和“房屋”的含义，以及“以色列”的代表清楚可知：“耶和华越过”是指诅咒将远离那里（参看<a href="7878.htm">7878</a>，<a href="7928.htm">7928</a>节）；“房屋”是指良善（<a href="3652.htm">3652</a>，<a href="3720.htm">3720</a>，<a href="4982.htm">4982</a>，<a href="7833.htm">7833</a>-<a href="7835.htm">7835</a>节）；“以色列”是指那些属于属灵教会的人，如前面频繁所述。之所以说他们被主保守在良善中，是因为当他们经过诅咒的地方或地狱时，这发生在他们被释放之时，他们被主保守在良善中。他们为了这个目的而做好预备，关于血、逾越节的羔羊及吃羔羊（它们是本章3-11，15-20，22，43-48经文的主题）的这些条例就描述了他们预备的这个过程。当他们被释放时，就会经过诅咒的地方或地狱，这一点可见于下文。</p>

In that He passed over the houses of the sons of Israel. That this signifies that damnation fled away from the goods in which they were held by the Lord, is evident from the signification of "Jehovah 
shall pass over," as being that damnation shall flee thence (see n. 7878, 7928); from the signification of "houses," as being goods (n. 3652, 3720, 4982, 7833-7835); and from the representation of Israel, 
as being those who are of the spiritual church (of which frequently above). It is said that they were held in goods by the Lord, because when they passed through the places of damnation or the hells, 
which was done when they were liberated, they were then held in good by the Lord. To this end they were prepared, the process of which preparation is described by the statutes concerning the blood, 
and the paschal lamb, and the eating thereof (in verses 3-11, 15-20, 22, 43-48 of this chapter). That when they were liberated they passed through places of damnation, or the hells, will be seen in 
what follows. </p>

'because He passed by the houses of Israel' means that damnation would stay away from the forms of good in which they were maintained by the Lord. This is clear from the meaning of 'Jehovah will pass 
by' as the fact that damnation will stay away from there, as above in <a href="7878.htm">7878</a>, <a href="7928.htm">7928</a>; from the meaning of 'the houses' as forms of good, dealt with in <a href="3652.htm">3652</a>, <a href="3720.htm">3720</a>, <a href="4982.htm">4982</a>, <a href="7833.htm">7833</a>-<a href="7835.htm">7835</a>; and from the representation 
of 'Israel' as those who belong to the spiritual Church, dealt with often. The reason for saying that they were maintained in forms of good by the Lord is that when they passed through places of 
damnation or the hells, which happened when they were delivered, they were maintained in good by the Lord. To this end they were made ready, and the process by which they were made ready is described 
by the statutes regarding the blood, the Passover lamb, and the eating of it, which are the subject in verses 3-11, 15-20, 22, 43-48 of this chapter. The fact that when they were delivered they passed 
through places of damnation or the hells will be seen below. </p>

</p><b>7939.</b>
`Quod praeteriverit praeter domos Israelis': quod significet quod damnatio aufugeret a bonis in quibus detenti sunt a Domino, constat (c)a significatione `(x)praeteribit Jehovah' quod sit quod fugiet 
inde damnatio, ut supra n. 7878, 7928; ex significatione `domuum {1}' quod sint bona, de qua n. 3652, 3720, 4982, 7833-7835; et ex repraesentatione `Israelis' quod sint qui ab Ecclesia spirituali, de 
qua saepius.  Quod dicatur quod in bonis detenti sint a Domino, est quia cum transibant per loca damnationis seu inferna, quod factum cum liberati, tunc detenti fuerunt in bono a Domino; ob hunc finem 
(x)praeparati sunt, praeparationis illius processus describitur per statuta de sanguine, deque agno paschali, {2}et ejus esu, de quibus in vers. hujus capitis, 3-11, 15-20, 22, 43-48; quod cum liberati, 
loca damnationis seu inferna transirent, videbitur in sequentibus. 	@1 i Israelis$ 	@2 ejusque esu, et pluribus, de quibus hactenus, videatur n. 7878$ </p>
