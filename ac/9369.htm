They who are in Persuasive Faith are meant by those of whom we read in these passages: </p>
<p>     Many will say to Me in that day, Lord, Lord, have we not prophesied by Thy name, and by Thy name have cast 
out demons, and in Thy name done many mighty deeds? But then will I confess unto them, I know you not, ye workers of iniquity (Matt. 7:22, 23).      Then shall ye begin to say, We have eaten and drunk 
in Thy presence, and Thou hast taught in our streets. But He shall say, I tell you, I know you not whence ye are; depart from me, all ye workers of iniquity (Luke 13:26, 27). They are also meant in 
Matthew by the five foolish virgins, who had no oil in their lamps: </p>
<p>     Afterward came the other virgins, saying, Lord, Lord, open to us. But He answering said, Verily, I say unto you, I know you 
not (Matt. 25:11, 12); </p>
<p>"oil in the lamps" denotes good in the faith (n. 886, 4638). </p>
<p>     EXODUS 24 </p>
<p>     1. And He said unto Moses, Come up unto Jehovah, thou and Aaron, Nadab and Abihu, and seventy 
of the elders of Israel; and bow yourselves afar off.      2. And Moses, he alone, shall come near unto Jehovah; and they shall not come near; and the people shall not come up with him.      3. 
And Moses came and reported to the people all the words of Jehovah, and all the judgments; and all the people answered with one voice, and said, All the words that Jehovah hath spoken we will do.   
   4. And Moses wrote all the words of Jehovah, and rose up early in the morning, and built an altar under the mountain, and twelve pillars for the twelve tribes of Israel.      5. And he sent youths 
of the sons of Israel, and they offered burnt-offerings, and sacrificed peace sacrifices of bullocks to Jehovah.      6. And Moses took half of the blood, and put it into basins; and half of the blood 
he sprinkled on the altar.      7. And he took the book of the covenant, and read it in the ears of the people; and they said, All things that Jehovah hath spoken we will do and hear.      8. And 
Moses took the blood, and sprinkled on the people, and said, Behold the blood of the covenant that Jehovah hath made with you upon all these words.      9. And there went up Moses and Aaron, Nadab and 
Abihu, and seventy of the elders of Israel.      10. And they saw the God of Israel; and there was under His feet as a work of sapphire stone, and as the substance of heaven in respect to cleanness.  
    11. And unto the sons of Israel who were set apart He sent not His hand: and they saw God, and did eat and drink.      12. And Jehovah said unto Moses, Come up to Me into the mountain, and be 
thou there; and I will give thee the tables of stone, and the law, and the commandment, which I will write to teach them.      13. And Moses rose up, and Joshua his minister; and Moses went up unto 
the mountain of God.      14. And he said unto the elders, Sit ye here for us, until we return unto you; and behold Aaron and Hur are with you; whosoever hath words, let him come near unto them.   
   15. And Moses went up unto the mountain, and the cloud covered the mountain.      16. And the glory of Jehovah tarried upon Mount Sinai, and the cloud covered it six days; and on the seventh day He 
called unto Moses out of the midst of the cloud.      17. And the aspect of the glory of Jehovah was like devouring fire on the top of the mountain in the eyes of the sons of Israel.      18. And 
Moses entered into the midst of the cloud, and went up unto the mountain; and Moses was in the mountain forty days and forty nights. </p>

Those whose faith is no more than persuasion are meant by the following people, in Matthew,  </p>
<blockquote>
Many will say to Me on that day, Lord, Lord, did we not prophesy through Your name, and through Your name 
cast out demons, and do many mighty works in Your name? But then I will confess to them, I do not know you, you workers of iniquity. <a href="http://bible.gospelcom.net/cgi-bin/bible?passage=Matt%207:22,%2023&amp;version=ESV&amp;interface=print&amp;showfn=yes&amp;showxref">Matt 7:22, 23</a>.  
</blockquote>
<p>Also in Luke,  </p>
<blockquote>
Then you will begin to say, 
We ate in Your presence and we drank; and You taught in our streets. But He will say, I say to you, I do not know where you come from; depart from Me, all you workers of iniquity. <a href="http://bible.gospelcom.net/cgi-bin/bible?passage=Luke%2013:26,%2027&amp;version=ESV&amp;interface=print&amp;showfn=yes&amp;showxref">Luke 13:26, 27</a>.  
</blockquote>
<p>The 
same people are also meant by 'the five foolish virgins who had no oil in their lamps', in Matthew,  </p>
<blockquote>
Finally those virgins came, saying, Lord, Lord, open to us. But He replying will say, Truly 
I say to you, I do not know you. <a href="http://bible.gospelcom.net/cgi-bin/bible?passage=Matt%2025:11,%2012&amp;version=ESV&amp;interface=print&amp;showfn=yes&amp;showxref">Matt 25:11, 12</a>.

Illi qui in fide persuasiva sunt intelliguntur per hos apud Matthaeum, 	Multi dicent Mihi in die illo, Domine, Domine, nonne per nomen Tuum prophetavimus, et per nomen Tuum daemonia ejecimus, et in 
nomine Tuo multas virtutes fecimus? sed tunc confitebor illis, Non novi vos, operarii iniquitatis, vii 22, 23: </p>
<p>tum apud Lucam, 	Tunc incipietis dicere, Edimus coram Te, et bibimus, et in plateis nostris 
docuisti; sed dicet, Dico vobis, Non novi vos unde sitis; discedite a Me, omnes operarii iniquitatis, xiii 26, 27: </p>
<p>intelliguntur etiam per `quinque virgines stultas quae non habebant oleum in lampadibus,' 
apud Matthaeum, 	Tandem venerunt illae virgines, dicentes, Domine, Domine, aperi nobis; Ille vero respondens dicet, Amen, dico vobis, Non novi vos, xxv 11, 12; </p>

bonum in fide, n. 886, 4638. CAPUT XXIV 	1.  Et ad Moschen dixit, Ascende ad JEHOVAM, tu et Aharon, Nadab et Abihu, et septuaginta de senioribus Israelis, et incurvetis vos e longinquo. 	2.  Et appropinquabit 
Moscheh solus ille ad JEHOVAM, et illi non appropinquabunt, et populus non ascendent cum illo. 	3.  Et venit Moscheh et renuntiavit populo omnia verba JEHOVAE et omnia judicia; et respondit 
omnis populus voce una, et dixerunt, Omnia verba quae locutus est JEHOVAH faciemus. 	4.  Et scripsit Moscheh omnia verba JEHOVAE, et surrexit mane in matutino, et aedificavit altare sub monte, et 
duodecim statuas pro duodecim tribubus Israelis. 	5.  Et misit pueros filiorum Israelis, et obtulerunt holocausta, et sacrificaverunt sacrificia pacifica JEHOVAE juvencos. 	6.  Et accepit Moscheh dimidium 
sanguinis, et posuit in crateribus, et dimidium sanguinis sparsit super altare. 	7.  Et accepit librum foederis, et legit in auribus populi, et dixerunt, Omnia quae locutus JEHOVAH faciemus et 
audiemus. 	8.  Et accepit Moscheh sanguinem et sparsit super populum, et dixit, Ecce sanguis foederis quod pepigit JEHOVAH cum vobis super omnia verba haec. 	9.  Et ascendit Moscheh et Aharon, Nadab 
et Abihu, et septuaginta ex senioribus Israelis. 	10.  Et viderunt DEUM Israelis, et sub pedibus Ipsius sicut opus lapidis sapphiri, et sicut substantia caeli quoad munditiem. 	11.  Et ad sepositos 
filios Israelis non misit manum suam; et viderunt DEUM, et (x)comederunt et biberunt. 	12.  Et dixit JEHOVAH ad Moschen, Ascende ad Me in montem, et esto ibi; et dabo tibi tabulas lapidis, et legem, 
et praeceptum, quae scribam ad docendum illos. 	13.  Et surrexit Moscheh et Jehoschua minister ejus, et ascendit Moscheh ad montem DEI. 	14.  Et ad seniores dixit, Sedete (x)nobis in hoc, donec revertamur 
ad vos; et ecce Aharon et Chur vobiscum; quisquis habens verba, accedat ad illos. 	15.  Et ascendit Moscheh ad montem, et obtexit nubes montem. 	16.  Et commorabatur gloria JEHOVAE super monte 
Sinai, et obtexit eum {1} nubes sex dies; et vocavit ad Moschen in die septimo e medio nubis. 	@1 Es. iv 5 written in m relates to nubes	cp n. 9433$ 	17.  Et aspectus gloriae JEHOVAE sicut ignis 
comedens in capite montis oculis filiorum Israelis. 	18.  Et intravit Moscheh in medium nubis, et ascendit ad montem; et fuit Moscheh in monte quadraginta dies et quadraginta noctes. </p>
