<h3 align="center" class="ired">属天的奥秘 第2077节</h3>
<h4 align="center"></h4><p><strong>2077.</strong>“亚伯拉罕对神说”表从爱而来的主的直觉。这从“对神说”的含义清楚可知，前面多次说明，“对神说”表示直觉。“亚伯拉罕”在此表示处于这种状态和这个年龄的主，这在前面已说明（<a href="1989.htm">1989</a>节）。主出于爱说这句话，这是显而易见的。因为源于爱的情感从经上的这句话中流露出来，即“但愿以实玛利活在你面前”。主的情感或爱就是神性，也就是说，它针对全人类，祂渴望通过其人性本质与神性本质的融合将全人类与祂自己完全联结起来，并永远救赎他们。关于这爱，可参看第一卷（<a href="1735.htm">1735</a>节）；关于主出于这爱不断与地狱争战，参看1690，1789，1812节；关于在其人性与神性的融合中，祂唯独关注神性与人类的结合，可参看2034节。<br />主爱的性质超越所有人的认知，在那些不知道何为天使所在的天堂之爱的人看来，也是最难以置信的。为从地狱中抢救灵魂，众天使根本不在乎献上自己的生命；甚至如有可能，他们宁愿代替那灵魂去忍受地狱的痛苦。因此，他们至内在的喜乐就是将从死中复活的人送入天堂。不过，他们坦承，这爱没有一丁点来自他们自己，它的方方面面唯独来自主。事实上，若有人有别的想法，他们会感到很愤慨。</p>

Abraham said unto God. That this signifies the Lord's perception from love, is evident from the signification of "saying unto God," as being to perceive, which has often been explained before. That "Abraham" 
here signifies the Lord in such a state and at such an age, has been stated above (n. 1989). That the Lord said this from love, is evident, for the affection of love shines forth from the very 
words when it is said, "Would that Ishmael might live before Thee!" The Lord's affection or love was Divine, being toward the universal human race, which He willed to completely adjoin to Himself, and 
to save to eternity, by means of the union of His Human Essence with His Divine Essence (concerning which love, see Part First, n. 1735; and that from this love the Lord continually fought against 
the hells, n. 1690, 1789, 1812; also that in the union of His Human with His Divine, He regarded nothing but the conjunction of the Divine with the human race, n. 2034).  [2] Love such as the Lord had 
transcends all human understanding, and is in the highest degree incredible to those who do not know what the heavenly love is in which the angels are. To save a soul from hell, the angels would regard 
death as nothing, nay, if it were possible they would undergo hell for that soul. Hence it is the inmost of their joy to translate into heaven one who is rising from the dead. But they confess that 
this love is not one whit from themselves, but that all things of it both in general and in particular are from the Lord alone; nay, they manifest irritation if anyone thinks otherwise. </p>

That 'Abraham said to God' means the Lord's perception from love is clear from the meaning of 'saying to God' as perceiving, dealt with quite often already. That 'Abraham' here means the Lord when passing 
through that state and that age has been stated above in <a href="1989.htm">1989</a>. The Lord, it is evident, uttered this out of love, for the actual words used, 'O that Ishmael might live before You!' are an expression 
of an affection originating in love. The Lord's affection or love was Divine; that is to say, it was directed towards the whole human race which He desired, through the union of His Human Essence 
with the Divine Essence, to join completely to Himself and save eternally. Concerning that love see Volume One, in <a href="1735.htm">1735</a>; concerning the fact that the Lord out of this love contended constantly with the 
hells, <a href="1690.htm">1690</a>, <a href="1789.htm">1789</a>, <a href="1812.htm">1812</a>; and concerning the fact that in the union of His Human with the Divine His sole regard was nothing other than the conjunction of the Divine with the human race, <a href="2034.htm">2034</a> above. </p>
<p></p>
<p><b>[2]</b>
The nature of the Lord's love surpasses all human understanding and is unbelievable in the extreme to people who do not know what heavenly love is in which angels abide. To save a soul from hell 
the angels think nothing of giving their own lives; indeed if it were possible they would suffer hell themselves in place of that soul. Consequently their inmost joy is to transport into heaven someone 
rising from the dead. They confess however that that love does not originate one little bit in themselves but that every single aspect of it does so in the Lord alone. Indeed they are incensed if 
anyone thinks anything different. </p>

`Dixit Abraham ad Deum': quod significat perceptionem Domini ex amore, constat a significatione `dicere ad Deum' quod sit percipere, de qua saepius prius: quod `Abraham' significet hic Dominum in tali 
statu et in tali aetate, supra n. 1989 dictum est. Quod Dominus hoc {1} ex amore dixerit, patet, nam ex ipsis verbis elucet affectio amoris cum dicitur `utinam Jishmael vivat coram Te.'  Affectio seu 
amor Domini fuit Divinus, nempe erga universum genus humanum, quod per unionem Humanae Suae Essentiae cum Divina Sibi prorsus adjungere et salvare in aeternum voluit; de quo amore videatur in Parte 
Prima n. 1735; et quod Dominus ex amore hoc continue pugnaverit contra inferna, n. 1690, 1789, 1812; et quod in unione Humani Sui cum Divino, nihil nisi conjunctionem Divini cum humano genere spectaverit, 
supra n. 2034.  [2] Amor qualis Domino, transcendit omnem intellectum humanum, et incredibilis est maxime illis qui non sciunt quid amor caelestis in quo sunt angeli; angeli illi pro salvanda anima 
ex inferno, nihili pendunt mortem, immo, si potuissent, pro illa infernum subirent; inde intimum eorum gaudii est aliquem ex mortuis resurgentem in caelum transferre; sed fatentur quod amor ille ne 
hilum sit (c)ex ipsis, sed omnia et singula ejus a solo Domino; immo succensent si quis aliud cogitat. 	@1 haec.$ </p>
