<h4 align="center"></h4><p><strong>1172.</strong>“底但”表对存在于仪式中的低级属天事物的认知。这从以下圣言经文明显可知，以西结书：<br />底但人与你交易，许多海岛作你手下的商人；以象牙角和乌木作送给你的贡物。（以西结书<a href="http://39-27.cn/结27.15.htm">27:15</a>）<br />“象牙角和乌木”表构成敬拜形式或仪式的外在良善。同一先知书：<br />底但人用马车的斗篷与你交易。亚拉伯人和基达的一切首领都作你的客商。（以西结书<a href="http://39-27.cn/结27.20.htm">27:20</a>，<a href="http://39-27.cn/结27.21.htm">21</a>）<br />此处“马车的斗篷”同样表外在良善，或仪式的良善。耶利米书：<br />他们的智慧变得腐朽不堪。底但的居民哪，要转身逃跑，住在深密处。（耶利米书<a href="http://39-27.cn/耶49.7.htm">49:7</a>，<a href="http://39-27.cn/耶49.8.htm">8</a>）<br />此处，“底但”的准确意义表没有发自内心对主的内在敬拜或爱慕的仪式，论到这仪式，经上说他们“要转身逃跑，住在深密处”。从上述经文明显可知：“古实的儿子”表对属灵事物的认知；“拉玛的儿子”表对属天事物的认知。</p>

<p><strong>[NCE]1172.</strong> Dedan symbolizes knowledge of the lower-level heavenly attributes that are present in ritual, as the following passages from the Word show. In Ezekiel:<br />The children of Dedan were your dealers; many islands were your traders at hand. Horns of ivory and items of ebony they have brought as your tribute. (<a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_1172/bible_king-james-version_ezekiel_27_15" target=_top>Ezekiel 27:15</a>)<br />In an inner sense, horns of ivory and items of ebony are anything that is outwardly good about worship, or about ritual. In the same author:<br />Dedan was your dealer in clothes for the chariot that allow free movement. Arabia and all the chiefs of Kedar ... (<a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_1172/bible_king-james-version_ezekiel_27_20-21" target=_top>Ezekiel 27:20-21</a>)<br />Clothes for the chariot that allow free movement are likewise something outwardly good, or what is good about ritual. In Jeremiah:<br />Their wisdom has become rank; run away! Dedan's inhabitants turned their backs; they took themselves down into the depths to live. (<a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_1172/bible_king-james-version_jeremiah_49_7-8" target=_top>Jeremiah 49:7-8</a>)<br />Dedan stands for ritual that holds within it no inward worship of the Lord, that is, no heartfelt veneration of him — this being the proper meaning of Dedan. The passage describes people whose ritual is like this as turning their backs and taking themselves down into the depths to live.<br />These passages now demonstrate that the children of Cush symbolize a knowledge of spiritual qualities, and the children of Raamah, a knowledge of heavenly qualities. </p>
<p align="center"><b>Potts(1905-1910) 1172</b></p><p><b>1172.</b>
That by "Dedan" are signified the knowledges of the lower celestial things that are in rituals, is evident from the following passages in the Word. In Ezekiel: </p>
<p>     The sons of Dedan were thy traders; 
many isles were the mart of thy hand; they brought thee for a present horns of ivory, and ebony (Ezek. 27:15). "Horns of ivory, and ebony" are in the internal sense exterior goods, which are of worship, 
or of rituals. In the same: </p>
<p>     Dedan was thy trader in garments of freedom for the chariot; Arabia and all the princes of Kedar (Ezek. 27:20-21). Here in like manner "garments of freedom for 
the chariot" are exterior goods, or goods of rituals. In Jeremiah: </p>
<p>     Their wisdom is become stinking; flee ye, they have turned themselves away, they have let themselves down to dwell in the deep, 
O inhabitants of Dedan (Jer. 49:7-8). Here "Dedan" in the proper sense denotes rituals in which there is no internal worship or adoration of the Lord from the heart, of which it is said that they 
"turn themselves away and let themselves down to dwell in the deep." From these passages it is now evident that knowledges of spiritual things are signified by "the sons of Cush;" and knowledges of celestial 
things by "the sons of Raamah." </p>

<p align="center"><b>Elliott(1983-1999) 1172</b></p><p><b>1172.</b>
'Dedan' means cognitions of lower celestial things that exist in ritual forms. This is clear from the following places in the Word: In Ezekiel, </p>
<blockquote>
The sons of Dedan were your traders, many islands were 
the merchandise of your hand; horns of ivory, and ebony they brought as your present. <a href="http://bible.gospelcom.net/cgi-bin/bible?passage=Ezek%2027:15&amp;version=ESV&amp;interface=print&amp;showfn=yes&amp;showxref">Ezek 27:15</a> 
</blockquote>
<p>'Horns of ivory, and ebony' in the internal sense means the exterior goods that constitute forms 
of worship or ritual. In the same prophet, </p>
<blockquote>
Dedan, she was your trader in chariot-cloaks,<A name="fntext1"></a><A href="#fn1"><sup>a</sup></a> Arabia and all the princes of Kedar <a href="http://bible.gospelcom.net/cgi-bin/bible?passage=Ezek%2027:20,%2021&amp;version=ESV&amp;interface=print&amp;showfn=yes&amp;showxref">Ezek 27:20, 21</a>. 
</blockquote>
<p>Here 'chariot-cloaks'<A name="fntext1"></a><A href="#fn1"><sup>a</sup></a> in like manner means exterior 
goods, or those that constitute forms of ritual. In Jeremiah, </p>
<blockquote>
Their wisdom has become rotten. Flee! they have turned themselves away, they have taken themselves down to dwell in the deep, O inhabitants 
of Dedan. <a href="http://bible.gospelcom.net/cgi-bin/bible?passage=Jer%2049:7,%208&amp;version=ESV&amp;interface=print&amp;showfn=yes&amp;showxref">Jer 49:7, 8</a>. 
</blockquote>
<p>Here 'sedan' in the proper sense stands for forms of ritual which have no internal worship, that is, no worship of the Lord from the heart within them, and which are 
spoken of as 'turning themselves back, and taking themselves down to dwell in the deep'. From the quotations above it is now clear that 'the sons of Cush' means cognitions of spiritual things, and 'the 
sons of Raamah' cognitions of celestial.

Quod per 'Dedanem' significentur cognitiones caelestium inferiorum quae sunt in ritualibus, constat a sequentibus in Verbo locis; apud Ezechielem,  Filii Dedanis negotiatores tui, insulae multae {1}mercatura 
manus tuae, cornua eboris, et ebena adduxerunt honorarium tuum, xxvii 15;  'cornua eboris et ebena' sunt in sensu interno bona exteriora quae sunt cultus seu ritualium:  apud eundem,  Dedan 
negotiatrix tua in vestibus libertatis pro curru; Arabia et omnes principes Kedar, xxvii 20, 21;  ubi 'vestes libertatis' pro curru similiter sunt bona exteriora seu ritualium:  apud Jeremiam,  Putida 
facta est sapientia eorum; fugite, averterunt se, in profundum demiserunt se ad habitandum, habitatores Dedanis, xlix [7,] 8; </p>
<p>hic 'Dedan' in proprio sensu pro ritualibus in quibus non cultus internus 
seu adoratio Domini ex corde, de quibus praedicatur quod avertant se, et in profundum se demittant ad habitandum.  Ex his nunc constat quod per 'filios Cush' significentur cognitiones spiritualium, 
et per 'filios Raamae' cognitiones caelestium. @1 mercatores I, but see Heb. and A.E. 1146.$ </p>
