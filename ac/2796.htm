<h4 align="center"></h4><p><strong>2796.</strong>至于主所具有的各种状态，也就是此处所论述的主题，它们必不为人所知，因为人从不停下来反省一下自己状态的变化。然而，无论就理解力或思维而言，还是就意愿或情感而言，这些状态一直在进行。人之所以不停下来反省它们，是因为他以为自己里面的一切事物都遵循属世的秩序，指引它们的更高事物是不存在的。而事实上，一切事物都藉着与他同在的灵人并天使被调控。他的一切状态及其变化由此产生，从而被主引向唯独祂所预见的目的，直到永远。这是千真万确的，对此，我通过多年经历最清楚不过了。我得知并发现与我同在的是哪类灵人与天使，他们正在制造哪种状态。我可以着重声明：一切状态，哪怕最细微的细节，都出自这一源头，并由此被主引导。我还得知并发现每种状态如何包含许多其它状态，它们并未显现，而是作为一个总的状态一起显现。这些状态被排列进入井然有序地存在于自己序列里的状态中。对人来说，所有这一切是由主实现的；而对主自己来说，当祂活在世上时，它们都是由祂自己成就的。因为祂是神性，其生命的存在就是耶和华。<br />天使知道人在理解力之事和意愿之事上所具有的状态变化，它们所遵循的秩序、所经历的序列，以及主如何尽可能地将它们折向良善。天使的智慧具有这样的性质：他们能觉察所有这些事，直至最后的细节。所以，天使清清楚楚地觉察到在内义上所揭示的有关主所具有的状态变化这些事，因为他们居于从主流出的天堂之光中。人若简单地过着良善的生活，也能在某种程度上理解它们。但对那些沉浸于邪恶的人，以及那些处于智慧的谵妄状态的人来说，它们显得很模糊，甚至等同于无。因为这些人通过许多带来黑暗的事而模糊并熄灭了他们的属世和理性之光，无论他们自以为拥有何等大的光明。</p>

As regards the putting on of the various states by the Lord which is here treated of, they cannot but be unknown to man, because he never reflects on his changes of state; which are nevertheless going 
on continually, both as to what is of the understanding or the thoughts, and as to what is of the will or the affections. The reason of his not reflecting upon them is that he believes that all things 
in him follow in natural order, and that there is nothing higher which directs; whereas the case is that all things are disposed by means of the spirits and angels with him; and all his states and 
changes of states are therefrom, and are thus to eternity directed by the Lord to ends which the Lord alone foresees. That the reality is so, has become most fully known to me now by the experience of 
many years. It has also been given to know and observe what spirits and angels were with me, and what states they induced; and this I can solemnly assert-that all states, even to the least particulars, 
come from this source and are thereby directed by the Lord. It has also been given to know and observe that in every state there are a great many others, which do not appear, and which together appear 
as one general state; and that these states are disposed in relation to the states which follow in order in their series. With a man these things are done by the Lord; but with the Lord Himself, when 
He lived in the world, they were done by Himself; because He was Divine, and the very being of His life was Jehovah.  [2] The changes of state with man as to what is of the understanding and as to 
what is of the will, and the order in which they follow on, as also the series through which they pass, and thus how they are bent by the Lord as far as possible to good, it belongs to the angels to 
know. The wisdom of the angels is such that they perceive all these things most minutely. Hence it is that these things which are revealed in the internal sense concerning the changes of state with the 
Lord, are clearly and distinctly perceivable by the angels, because they are in the light of heaven from the Lord; and they are also in some degree intelligible to a man who lives in simple good; but 
they are merely obscure and as nothing to those who are in evil, and also to those who are in the deliriums of wisdom; for these have obscured and extinguished their natural and rational light by many 
things which have induced darkness, however much they may believe that they are preeminently in light. </p>

As regards the Lord's assumption of the various states which are the subject here, these are inevitably unknown to man since he never stops to reflect on his changes of state. Yet these are taking place 
all the time both as regards matters of the understanding, or thoughts, and as regards those of the will, or affections. The reason he does not stop to reflect on them is his belief that all things 
in him follow in natural order, and that nothing higher exists which directs them. But in actual fact every single thing is regulated by means of the spirits and angels residing with him, and all states 
and changes of state are brought about from this and so are being directed by the Lord for ever towards ends which the Lord alone foresees. The truth of this has been made fully known to me through 
experience that has now lasted for many years. I have also been given to know and to notice which spirits and angels were with me, and which states they were bringing about. This I can positively declare, 
that they are the source of all states, even to the least detail, and that they are directed by the Lord in the manner described. I have also been given to know and to notice how each state includes 
many other states which do not show themselves, and which, all of them together, are seen as one general state, and that those states have been arranged into states which follow in order within 
their own sequence. With man all this is effected by the Lord, but with the Lord Himself when He lived in the world, He effected it by Himself since He was Divine, and the very Being (Esse) of His life 
was Jehovah. </p>

<p><b>[2]</b>
 Knowledge regarding the changes of state in matters of the understanding and in those of the will with man, regarding the order in which they follow, and also regarding the sequence 
through which they pass, and regarding the way in which they are bent by the Lord as far as possible towards what is good, exists with angels. For the wisdom of angels is such that they perceive 
such matters to the last detail. Consequently these matters which have been revealed in the internal sense concerning changes of state with the Lord are perceptible clearly and distinctly to angels because 
they dwell in the light of heaven flowing from the Lord. They are also intelligible to some extent to man if he leads a life of simple good. But they are obscure and as nothing to those steeped 
in evil and also to those whose wisdom consists of demented ideas, for these ideas darken and extinguish their natural and rational light by means of many things which bring darkness, however much those 
people themselves imagine they have greater light than any others. </p>

{1} Quod induitiones variorum statuum a Domino attinet, de quibus hic agitur, non possunt non ignotae esse homini, quia nusquam super mutationes statuum reflectit, cum tamen hae continuae sunt, tam quoad 
intellectualia seu cogitationes, quam quoad voluntaria seu affectiones; quod super has {2} non reflectat, causa est quia credit omnia et singula apud se naturali ordine consequi, et nihil esse superius 
quod dirigit; cum tamen ita se habeat, quod omnia et singula disponantur per spiritus et angelos apud eum, quod omnes status et statuum mutationes inde sint, et sic dirigantur a Domino ad fines 
in aeternum, quos solus Dominus praevidet; quod ita se res habeat, mihi per plurium nunc annorum experientiam notissimum factum est; tum {3} scire et observare datum quinam spiritus et angeli apud me 
essent, et quosnam status inducerent; et hoc asseverare possum quod omnes status usque ad minima eorum inde veniant, et quod a Domino ita dirigantur; tum scire et observare datum, quod in unoquovis statu 
sint perplures alii, qui non {4} apparent, et qui cum simul sunt, apparent ut communis unus, et quod illi status dispositi sint ad status qui ordine in sua serie sequuntur: haec apud hominem fiunt 
a Domino; at apud Ipsum Dominum, cum vixit mundo, fiebant ab Ipso, quia Divinus erat et ipsum Esse vitae Ipsius fuit Jehovah.  Mutationes status quoad intellectualia et voluntaria apud hominem, et quo 
ordine consequuntur, tum per quas series labuntur, et sic quomodo flectuntur a Domino ad bonum quantum possibile, scire, angelicum est; angelorum sapientia {5} talis est ut {6} minutissima talia percipiant, 
inde est quod haec quae de mutationibus status apud Dominum in sensu interno revelata sunt, angelis quia in luce caeli a Domino, clare et distincte perceptibilia sint, etiam aliquantum intelligibilia 
homini qui in simplici bono vivit; sed solum obscura et velut nulla illis qui in {7} malo, tum qui in sapientiae deliriis sunt, hi enim naturale {8} et rationale suum lumen per plura quae tenebras 
induxerunt, obscurarunt et exstinxerunt, utcumque hi credunt se in luce esse prae aliis.      @1 This paragraph was written on the back of the Preface to this chapter, it had no number and is 
crossed through.  The number 2796 was given to what is here 2797, and 2797 to first three lines of 2798, 2798 to remainder.  Between 2795 and 2796 in A there are directions to insert the section on
