<h3 align="center" class="ired">属天的奥秘 第3219节</h3>
<h4 align="center"></h4><p><strong>3219.</strong>就在天使们讨论思维、观念和流注的同时，有飞鸟出现在灵人界，这些鸟的形体是照着他们讨论的主题形成的。正因如此，在圣言中，“飞鸟”表示理性概念，或构成思维的事物（参看<a href="40.htm">40</a>，<a href="745.htm">745</a>，<a href="776.htm">776</a>，<a href="991.htm">991</a>节）。有一次，几只鸟儿出现在我眼前，我发现一只又黑又丑，两只则又高贵又美丽。当我看到它们时，看哪！一些灵人猛地降到我身上，使我的神经和骨骼都震颤起来。当时，我以为和前几次一样，是恶灵在袭击我，试图毁灭我。当震颤停止，降到我身上的灵人不再移动时，我与他们交谈，询问这是怎么回事。<br />他们说，他们从一个天使社群那里掉了下来，那里正在讨论思维和流注。他们认为构成思维的事物是从外流入的，也就是说，如表象那样通过外在感官流入的。而他们所在的天使社群却认为它是从内流入的。他们自己因处于虚假而从那里掉下来。没有人把他们丢下去，因为天使不会将任何人从他们自己那里丢下去。正是由于在他们里面居于主导地位的虚假致使他们从那里掉下来，他们声称这才是原因。<br />我由此得知天上关于思维和流注的讨论由飞鸟来代表。那些处于虚假之人的讨论由又黑又丑的鸟来代表，而那些处于真理之人的讨论则由又高贵又美丽的鸟来代表。与此同时，我被告知，构成思维的一切观念从内流入，而非从外流入，哪怕这些观念看似从外流入。我还被告知，在后之物流入在先之物，或粗俗之物流入纯净之物，因而肉体流入灵魂，是违背次序的。 </p>

When the angels are conversing about knowledges, and ideas, and influx, there then appear in the world of spirits as it were birds, formed in accordance with the subject of their discourse. Hence it 
is that in the Word "birds" signify rational things, or those which are of thought (see n. 40, 745, 776, 991). There were once presented to my view birds, one dark and unsightly, but two noble and beautiful; 
and when I saw them, there then fell upon me some spirits with such violence as to strike a tremor into my nerves and bones. I imagined that then, as several times before, evil spirits were assaulting 
me, with intent to destroy me; but this was not the case; for when the tremor ceased, together with the emotion of the spirits who fell upon me, I spoke with them, asking what was the matter. [2] 
They said that they had fallen down from a certain angelic society in which there was discourse concerning thoughts and influx; and that they had held the opinion that things relating to thought 
flow in from without, that is, through the external senses, according to the appearance; whereas the heavenly society in which they were, held the opinion that they inflow from within; and as they (the 
speakers) were in falsity, they fell down-not that they were cast down, for the angels cast no one down from them, but being in falsity they fell down of themselves; and they said that this was the 
cause. [3] By this it was given to know that discourse in heaven concerning thoughts and influx is represented by birds; and that of those who are in falsity by dark and unsightly birds; but that of 
those who are in the truth, by birds noble and beautiful. I was at the same time instructed that all things of thought inflow from within, and not from without, although it appears so; and I was told 
that it is contrary to order for the posterior to flow into the prior, or the grosser into the purer; thus for the body to inflow into the soul. </p>

When angels are engaged in discussion about thoughts and ideas, and about influx, birds are seen at the same time in the world of spirits - the forms which the birds take being determined by the subject 
under discussion. This explains why birds in the Word mean rational concepts or things comprising thought, <a href="40.htm">40</a>, <a href="745.htm">745</a>, <a href="776.htm">776</a>, <a href="991.htm">991</a>. On one occasion birds came into view, and I saw that one was dark and 
ugly, two fine and beautiful. When I saw them, behold! certain spirits were there who then descended on me so violently as to send a tremor into my sinews and bones. I supposed that then, as had happened 
several times before, evil spirits were assailing me in an attempt to destroy me; but that was not so. When the tremor ceased and the spirits who had descended on me stopped moving, I spoke to them 
asking what it was all about. They said that they had fallen from a certain angelic community in which discussion was taking place about thoughts and influx, and that they had been of the opinion that 
the things which comprise thought flow in from without, that is to say, by way of the external senses, as is the appearance. But the angelic community in which they were present were of the opinion 
that it flowed from within. And because they themselves had been governed by falsity they had fallen from there. No one had cast them down, for angels do not cast anyone down from among themselves. It 
was owing to the falsity reigning in them that they had fallen from there. This had been the reason why it had happened. From this I was given to know that discussion in heaven about thoughts and influx 
is represented by birds - the discussion of those in whom falsity reigns by dark and ugly birds, but that of those who are governed by truth by fine and beautiful birds. I was at the same time told 
that all the ideas comprising thought enter into it from within, not from without, even though those ideas seem to do so. I was also told that it is contrary to order for what is posterior to flow 
into what is prior, or what is grosser into what is purer, and so for body to flow into soul. </p>

Cum angeli in sermone sunt de {1}cogitationibus, et de ideis, ac de influxu, tunc in mundo spirituum apparent sicut aves formatae secundum sermonis illorum subjectum; inde est quod aves in Verbo significent 
rationalia, seu illa quae sunt cogitationis, n. 40, 745, 776, 991. Quondam mihi in conspectum veniebant aves, una obscura et deformis, binae autem nobiles (c)et pulchrae, et cum viderem illas, 
ecce tunc incidebant in me aliqui spiritus tali vehementia ut tremorem incuterent nervis et ossibus; opinatus sum quod nunc sicut aliquoties prius, mali spiritus in me invaderent conatu perdendi, sed 
non tale erat; cessante tremore, (c)et spirituum qui incidebant, emotione, locutus cum illis, quaerens quid esset, dicebant quod delapsi {2}sint e quadam societate angelica, in qua sermo fuit de cogitationibus 
et influxu, et quod illi fuissent in opinione quod illa quae sunt cogitationis influant ab extra, scilicet per sensus externos, secundum apparentiam; sed societas caelestis in qua erant, quod 
influant ab intra; et quia in falso essent, quod {3}inde delapsi sint, (t)non quod dejecti, nam angeli nullum a se dejiciunt, sed quia in falsitate, deciderunt inde a se; et quod haec causa fuisset. 
Inde scire datum quod sermo in caelo de cogitationibus et influxu repraesentetur per aves, et illorum qui in falso sunt, per aves obscuras et deformes, qui autem in vero, per aves nobiles et pulchras; 
ac simul instructus quod omnia cogitationis influant ab intra, non autem ab extra tametsi ita apparet; ac dictum quod contra ordinem sit ut posterius influat in prius, aut crassius in purius, ita 
ut corpus in animam. @1 cognitionibus I, cogitationibus ac meditationibus, ut A$  @2 essent$  @3 idcirco$  </p>
