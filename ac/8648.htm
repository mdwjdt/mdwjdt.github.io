<h3 align="center" class="ired">属天的奥秘 第8648节</h3>
<h4 align="center"></h4><p><strong>8648.</strong>“就是摩西从前打发走的”表就属于属灵教会之人的状态而言，至今仍存在的分离。这从“打发走”的含义清楚可知，“打发走”是指分离。之所以是就属于属灵教会之人的状态而言，是因为在那些属于属灵教会之人的第一个状态下，良善不显现，只有真理显现。这一切的性质从前面关于那些属于属灵教会之人的两个状态的说明可以看出来；也就是说，在第一个状态下，他们通过真理，而非良善行事；但在第二个状态下，则通过良善行事。在第一个状态下，就是他们通过真理而非良善行事的时候，良善似乎是缺席的，就像一个被打发走的妻子；但在第二个状态下，就是他们通过良善行事的时候，良善是在场的，就像一个与其丈夫联结的妻子。这些就是“摩西从前打发走的”所表示的事。<br />要进一步知道，这是就那些属于属灵教会的人而言的；因为从主发出的真理总是与其良善联结。但在重生之前的第一个状态下，良善不被接受，只有真理被接受，尽管这二者都经由天堂从主流入。然而，在重生之后的第二个状态下，与真理联结的良善被接受。人所造成的事被认为是主所行的事，因为表面上看，祂似乎是造成这事的那一位。其它许多例子也是这种情况，例如经上论到主，说祂做坏事，惩罚，投入地狱。这些事之所以论及主，是因为表面上看，祂似乎就是那带来这一切的；而事实上，一个人所遭遇到的一切祸事，都是由这个人造成的。在圣言中，像这样的事还有很多；然而，凡出于对真理的情感，为了过一种良善的生活而查究圣经的人都会查清这些事，因为他被主启示。</p>

After he had sent her away. That this signifies separation hitherto relatively to the state of those who are of the spiritual church, is evident from the signification of "sending away," as being separation. 
That it is relatively to the state of those who are of the spiritual church, is because in the first state of those who are in the spiritual church good does not appear, but only truth. How this 
is, can be seen from what has been already shown concerning the two states of those who are of the spiritual church; namely, that in the first state they act from truth and not from good, but in the 
second they act from good. In the first state, when they act from truth and not from good, good is as it were absent, and is like a wife that has been sent away; but in the second state, when they 
act from good, then good is present, and is like a wife that is conjoined with her man. This is what is meant in the internal sense by "after he had sent her away." [2] Be it further known, that this 
is relatively to those who are of the spiritual church, for the truth which proceeds from the Lord is always conjoined with its good; but in the first state, which is before regeneration, good is not 
received, but only truth, although both flow in through heaven from the Lord. In the second state however, which is after regeneration, good is received conjoined with truth. That which takes place with 
man is predicated as taking place with the Lord, for the reason that it so appears. This is the case in very many other instances, as for example, that the Lord does evil, punishes, casts into hell. 
These things are predicated of the Lord because it appears so, when yet all evil which befalls man is done by the man. There are very many such things in the Word, which however are plain to him who 
searches the Scriptures from the affection of truth, and for the sake of the good of life, because he is enlightened by the Lord. </p>

'After he had sent her away' means a separation existing up to now in respect of the state of those belonging to the spiritual Church. This is clear from the meaning of 'sending away' as a separation. 
The reason why this is in respect of the state of those belonging to the spiritual Church is that in the first state of those who belong to the spiritual Church good is not apparent, only truth. The 
nature of all this may be seen from what has been shown previously about the two states of those belonging to the spiritual Church, that is to say, where it has been shown that in the first state actions 
spring from truth, not from good, but that in the second they do spring from good. In the first state, when actions spring from truth, not from good, good is seemingly absent; it is like a wife who 
has been sent away. But in the second state, when actions spring from good, good is present, and is like a wife joined to her husband (vir). These are the things that are meant in the internal sense 
by 'sending her away'. </p>
<p></p>
<p><b>[2]</b>
 It should in addition be recognized that this is in respect of those who belong to the spiritual Church; for truth coming from the Lord is always joined to its own good. 
But in the first state, which exists before regeneration, good is not received, only truth, even though both flow in from the Lord by way of heaven. But in the second state, which exists after regeneration, 
good joined to truth is received. What is brought about by man is said to be something done by the Lord, for the reason that He appears to be the one bringing it about. The situation is the same 
with very many other things said of the Lord, such as when He is said to do ill, punish, and cast into hell; these things are said to be done by the Lord, because He appears to be the one who brings 
them about, when in fact everything bad that happens to a person is of human origin. Things like these said of the Lord in the Word are very many, but they are made clear to one who searches the Scriptures 
with an affection for truth and for the sake of leading a good life; for he is enlightened by the Lord. </p>

`Post dimissiones ejus': quod significet separationem hactenus respective ad statum illorum qui ab Ecclesia spirituali, constat a significatione `dimissionum' quod {1}sint separatio; quod sit respective 
ad statum illorum qui ab Ecclesia spirituali, est quia in primo statu illorum qui ab Ecclesia spirituali bonum non apparet, sed modo verum.  Quomodo cum hoc se habet, constare potest ab illis quae 
prius, de bino statu illorum qui ab Ecclesia spirituali, ostensa sunt, quod nempe in primo statu ex vero agatur, non ex bono, at in altero ex bono; in primo statu, cum ex vero non ex bono agitur, est 
bonum quasi absens, et est sicut uxor dimissa, at in altero statu, cum ex bono agitur, tunc est bonum praesens, et sicut uxor conjuncta suo viro; haec sunt quae in sensu interno intelliguntur per post 
dimissiones ejus.' 	2 Sciendum est porro quod hoc respective sit ad illos qui ab Ecclesia spirituali, {2}nam verum quod a Domino procedit est semper conjunctum suo bono, at in primo statu, qui est 
ante regenerationem, non recipitur bonum sed verum, tametsi per caelum a Domino influit utrumque, in altero autem statu, qui est post regenerationem, recipitur bonum vero conjunctum; quod (x)fit apud 
hominem, hoc praedicatur fieri apud Dominum, ex eo quod ita appareat; ita se habet in perpluribus aliis, sicut pro exemplo, quod Dominus malum faciat, puniat, conjiciat in infernum; haec praedicantur 
de Domino, quia ita apparet, cum tamen omne malum, quod fit homini sit ab homine; talia in Verbo {3}permulta sunt, quae tamen scrutanti {4}scripturas ex affectione veri, (d)et propter bonum vitae, patent, 
quia (d)is illustratur a Domino. 	@1 sint altered to sit$ 	@2 nam Verum Divinum semper est conjunctum suo bono, at in primo statu non recipitur bonum sed verum, in altero autem statu recipitur 
bonum; quod fit apud hominem hoc praedicatur fieri a Divino quoniam ita apparet, sicut pro exemplo quod Divinum homini malum faciat, hoc quia ita apparet praedicatur de Divino, cum tamen est in homine
