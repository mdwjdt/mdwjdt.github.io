<h3 align="center" class="ired">属天的奥秘 第4691节</h3>
<h4 align="center"></h4><p><strong>4691.</strong>“难道你真要作我们的王吗？难道你真要管辖我们吗”表理解的事物和意愿的事物真的要服从它吗？这从“作王”和“管辖”的含义清楚可知：“作王”是指理解事物的服从；“管辖”是指意愿事物的服从。“作他们的王”和“管辖他们”表示它们要服从，这是显而易见的；但此处之所以用这两个词，是因为一个论及理解的事物，另一个论及意愿的事物。这在圣言，尤其预言部分是很常见的，因为一件具体的事以两种方式来表述。凡不知道此中奥秘的人，都必以为这只是一个用来强调的重复。但事实并非如此。因为圣言的每一个细节里面都有一个天上的婚姻，即真理与良善，并良善与真理的婚姻；正如人里面理解力与意愿的婚姻。这双重表述当中一种涉及真理，另一种涉及良善；因此，一种涉及理解力，因为真理属于这理解力；另一种涉及意愿，因为良善属于这意愿。此外，圣言中所用的表述由无论何种情况下都表示类似这些的事物的词语构成。这是隐藏在使用双重表述来描述一件具体事背后的奥秘（参看<a href="683.htm">683</a>，<a href="793.htm">793</a>，<a href="801.htm">801</a>，<a href="2173.htm">2173</a>，<a href="2516.htm">2516</a>，<a href="2712.htm">2712</a>，<a href="4138.htm">4138</a>e节）。此处“作他们的王”和“管辖他们”也是这种情况：“作王”涉及属于理解力的真理，“管辖”涉及属于意愿的良善。“国”也论及真理（<a href="1672.htm">1672</a>，<a href="2547.htm">2547</a>节），“管辖”（经上或译为权柄）论及良善，如在但以理书中论述主的神性人身之处的情形：<br />得了权柄、荣耀、国度，使各民、各族、各语言的人都拜祂。祂的权柄是永远的，不能废去，祂的国必不败坏。（但以理书<a href="http://39-27.cn/但7.14.htm">7:14</a>）<br />诗篇：<br />你的国是永远的国，你执掌的权柄存到万代。（诗篇<a href="http://39-27.cn/诗145.13.htm">145:13</a>）</p>

Shalt thou indeed reign over us? Or shalt thou indeed have dominion over us? That this signifies were they to be subject as to the things of the understanding and of the will, is evident from the signification 
of "reigning," as being to be subject as to the things of the understanding; and from the signification of "having dominion," as being to be subject as to the things of the will. That "to reign 
over them and to have dominion over them" denotes that they were to be made subject is evident, but the reason why the two expressions are here used is that one refers to the things of the understanding, 
and the other to the things of the will. It is common in the Word, especially the prophetic, for one thing to be expressed in two ways; and he who does not know the mystery in this, cannot but 
think it a mere repetition for the sake of emphasis. But this is not so, for in every particular of the Word there is the heavenly marriage, namely, the marriage of truth with good and of good with 
truth; just as there is a marriage of the understanding and the will in man. One expression has reference to truth, the other to good; thus one has reference to the intellect, for to this belongs truth, 
and the other to the will, for to this belongs good. Moreover, the expressions in the Word consist of terms that constantly have such a signification. This is the secret which lies concealed in two 
expressions being used for one thing (see n. 683, 793, 801, 2173, 2516, 2712, 4138). So also here in regard to "reigning over them" and "having dominion over them" - "reigning" refers to truth which 
is of the understanding, and "having dominion" to good which is of the will. "Kingdom" is also predicated of truth (n. 1672, 2547), and "dominion" of good, as in Daniel, in which passage also the subject 
is the Lord's Divine Human: </p>
<p>     There was given Him dominion and glory and a kingdom, that all people, nations, and languages should worship Him; His dominion is an everlasting dominion, which shall 
not pass away, and His kingdom that which shall not perish (Dan. 7:14); </p>
<p>and in David: </p>
<p>     Thy kingdom is a kingdom of all eternities, and Thy dominion is into all generation and generation (Ps. 145:13). </p>

<p align="center"><b>Elliott(1983-1999) 4691</b></p><p><b>4691.</b>
'Are you indeed going to reign over us? Or are you indeed going to have dominion over us?' means, Were the concepts in their understandings and the desires in their wills to be made subject to it? This 
is clear from the meaning of 'reigning' as the subjection of concepts in the understanding, and from the meaning of 'having dominion' as the subjection of desires in the will. This meaning of 'reigning 
over them' and 'having dominion over them' - being made subject to - is self-evident; but the reason both expressions are used here is that one has regard to concepts in the understanding, the other 
to desires in the will. It is common in the Word, especially in the prophetical part, for one particular matter to be described by a dual expression. Anyone unaware of the arcanum lying behind this 
inevitably supposes that it is no more than a repetition made for the sake of emphasis. But that is not the case. Within every single part of the Word the heavenly marriage is present, namely the marriage 
of truth to good and of good to truth, just as there is a marriage of understanding and will in the human being. One part of a dual expression has reference to truth, the other to good, so that 
one has to do with the understanding since that is where truth belongs, the other with the will since this is where good belongs. Expressions used in the Word consist of words which in every case mean 
things like these. This is the arcanum lying behind the use of a dual expression to describe one particular matter, see <a href="683.htm">683</a>, <a href="793.htm">793</a>, <a href="801.htm">801</a>, <a href="2173.htm">2173</a>, <a href="2516.htm">2516</a>, <a href="2712.htm">2712</a>, <a href="4138.htm">4138</a> (end). So that is the case here also with 
'reigning over them' and 'having dominion over them'. 'Reigning' has regard to truth which belongs in the understanding, while 'dominion' has regard to good which belongs in the will; also, 'a kingdom' 
is used in reference to truth, <a href="1672.htm">1672</a>, <a href="2547.htm">2547</a>, and 'dominion' to good, as is also the case in Daniel where again the Lord's Divine Human is the subject, </p>
<blockquote>
To Him was given dominion and glory and kingdom, 
so that all peoples, nations and languages might worship Him. His dominion is an eternal dominion which will not pass away, and His kingdom one that will not perish. <a href="http://bible.gospelcom.net/cgi-bin/bible?passage=Dan%207:14&amp;version=ESV&amp;interface=print&amp;showfn=yes&amp;showxref">Dan 7:14</a>. 
</blockquote>
<p>And in David, </p>
<blockquote>
Your 
kingdom is a kingdom to all eternity, and Your dominion to every generation after generation. <a href="http://bible.gospelcom.net/cgi-bin/bible?passage=Ps%20145:13&amp;version=ESV&amp;interface=print&amp;showfn=yes&amp;showxref">Ps 145:13</a>.

</p><b>4691.</b>
`An regnando regnabis super nos? si dominando dominaberis in nos?': quod significet num quoad intellectualia et voluntaria subjecti essent, constat ex significatione `regnare' quod sit subjectum 
esse quoad intellectualia, et a significatione `dominari' quod sit subjectum esse quoad voluntaria; quod `regnare super eos' et `dominari in eos' sit subjectum fieri, patet; sed quod utrumque hic dicatur, 
est quia unum spectat intellectualia et alterum voluntaria; commune est in Verbo, imprimis prophetico, unam rem per bina exprimere; qui non novit arcanum quod in illo est, non aliter opinari 
{1} potest quam quod solum sit repetitio propter emphasin; </p>
<p>sed non ita est; in singulis Verbi est conjugium caeleste, nempe conjugium veri cum bono, et boni cum vero, sicut est conjugium intellectus 
et voluntatis in homine, una expressio se refert ad verum, altera ad bonum, ita una ad intellectuale nam hujus est verum, et altera ad voluntarium nam hujus est bonum, etiam expressiones in Verbo 
ex illis vocibus constant quae constanter significant talia; hoc arcanum est quod latet in eo quod una res per bina exprimatur, videatur n. 683, 793, 801, 2173, 2516, 2712, 4138 f; ita etiam hic 
`regnare super eos,' et `dominari in `eos'; </p>
<p>`regnare' etiam {2} spectat verum quod intellectus, `dominium' autem {3} bonum quod voluntatis, etiam `regnum' praedicatur de vero, n. 1672, 2547, et `dominium' 
de bono; ut quoque apud Danielem ubi etiam agitur de Divino Humano Domini,           Huic datum est dominium, et gloria, et regnum, ut omnes      populi, gentes, et linguae Ipsum colerent: 
 dominium Ipsius      dominium aeternum quod non transibit, et regnum Ipsius quod      non peribit, vii 14: </p>
<p>et apud Davidem,           Regnum tuum regnum omnium aeternitatum, et dominium      tuum 
in omnem generationem et generationem, Ps. cxlv 13.      @1 putare$      @2 enim$      @3 i spectat$ </p>
