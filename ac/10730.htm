<h3 align="center" class="ired">属天的奥秘 第10730节</h3>
<h4 align="center"></h4><p><strong>10730</strong>.“第七日你们要守为圣，要归耶和华为休息的安息日”表一个人重生的第二个状态，这时他与主结合；在至高意义上表主之人身与神性本身的合一。这从“安息日”的代表清楚可知。“安息日”是指一个人重生的第二个状态，这时他处于良善，因此被主引导（参看<a href="8510.htm">8510</a>，<a href="8890.htm">8890</a>，<a href="8893.htm">8893</a>，<a href="9274.htm">9274</a>节）；在至高意义上是指人身与神性本身在主里面的合一（<a href="8495.htm">8495</a>，<a href="10367.htm">10367</a>，<a href="10374.htm">10374</a>节）。当主在世界上时，祂首先将祂的人身变成神性真理；但当离开这个世界时，祂通过与自己里面的神性本身的合一而将祂的人身变成神性良善。就至高意义而言，这一点由“安息日”来代表，故它被称为“要归耶和华为休息的安息日”。主以同样的方式向一个正在被祂重生的人做这些事。祂首先用真理充满他，之后通过真理将他与良善结合，从而与祂自己结合。这就是“安息日”在相对意义上所代表的；因为一个人的重生就是主荣耀的一个形像；也就是说，主怎样荣耀祂的人身，就怎样使一个人重生。<br />严格来说，“安息日”表示休息与平安，因为当主将祂的人身与神性本身合一时，祂就拥有了平安。这时争战就止息了，天堂和地狱里的一切事物都被恢复秩序；因此，不仅祂自己拥有平安，连天上的天使和地上的世人也有平安和拯救。<br />由于此处所论述的这两个过程是教会的其它一切事物所依赖的包罗万象的共性真理，所以此处只阐述了守安息日为圣，安息日表示这两个过程。因为最包罗万象的共性真理就是，主将祂的人身与神性本身合一，人由此拥有平安和拯救。这也是一个包罗万象的共性真理：人必须与主结合，好叫他能拥有平安和拯救，这种结合通过重生实现。这也是为何以色列民族当中的安息日是与耶和华立约，也就是与主结合的主要代表和主要标志（参看<a href="10357.htm">10357</a>，<a href="10372.htm">10372</a>节）；“约”表示结合。</p>

And on the seventh day there shall be to you holiness, a Sabbath of Sabbath to Jehovah. That this signifies the second state of the regeneration of man, when he has conjunction with the Lord; and that 
in the supreme sense it signifies the union of the Lord's Human with the Divine Itself; is evident from the representation of the Sabbath, as being the second state of the regeneration of man, when 
he is in good, and thus is led by the Lord (see n. 8510, 8890, 8893, 9274); and as being in the supreme sense the union of the Human with the Divine Itself in the Lord (n. 8495, 10367, 10374). For when 
the Lord was in the world, He first made His Human Divine truth; but when He went out from the world, He made His Human Divine good through a union with the Divine Itself that was in Him. In the supreme 
sense this is represented by the Sabbath, and therefore it is called "a Sabbath of Sabbath to Jehovah." The Lord does the like with the man whom He is regenerating. He first imbues him with truths, 
and afterward by means of the truths He conjoins him with good, thus with Himself. This is represented by the Sabbath in the relative sense; for the regeneration of man is an image of the glorification 
of the Lord; that is, as the Lord glorified His Human, so He regenerates man.  [2] By the "Sabbath" in its proper sense is signified rest and peace, because when the Lord united His Human to the 
Divine Itself He had peace, for the combats then ceased, and all things in the heavens and in the hells had been reduced into order. And accordingly there was peace not for Him only; but also for the 
angels in the heavens, and for men on earth, there were peace and salvation.  [3] As these two truths here treated of are the very universals on which all other things of the church depend, therefore 
the hallowing of the Sabbath, by which these two are signified, is the only thing here set forth. For the universal truth of all is that the Lord united His Human to the Divine Itself, and that from 
this man has peace and salvation. And it is also a universal truth that man must be conjoined with the Lord, in order that he may have peace and salvation, and this is effected by means of regeneration. 
For this reason also, among the Israelitish nation the Sabbath was the chief representative and the chief sign of a covenant with Jehovah, that is, of conjunction with the Lord (see n. 10357, 10372); 
a "covenant" denotes conjunction. </p>

'And the seventh day shall be a holy day for you, a sabbath of rest to Jehovah' means the second state in the regeneration of a person, when that person is joined to the Lord, and in the highest sense 
means the union of the Lord's Human with the Divine itself. This is clear from the representation of 'the sabbath' as the second state in the regeneration of a person, when a person is governed by good 
and for that reason is led by the Lord, dealt with in <a href="8510.htm">8510</a>, <a href="8890.htm">8890</a>, <a href="8893.htm">8893</a>, <a href="9274.htm">9274</a>, and in the highest sense as the union of the Human with the Divine itself within the Lord, dealt with in <a href="8495.htm">8495</a>, <a href="10356.htm">10356</a>, <a href="10367.htm">10367</a>, <a href="10374.htm">10374</a>. When the Lord was in the world He first made His Human Divine Truth, but when He left the world He made His Human Divine Good through union with the Divine itself which was within Him. This 
is represented by 'the sabbath' in the highest sense, hence the use of the words 'a sabbath of rest to Jehovah'. The Lord does things in a similar way for a person whom He is regenerating. First He 
endows the person with truths, after which He uses the truths to join him to good, thus to Himself. This is what 'the sabbath' represents in the relative sense; for the regeneration of a person is an 
image of the glorification of the Lord, that is, as the Lord glorified His Human, so He regenerates a person.  </p>

 Strictly speaking, 'the sabbath' means rest and peace, because when the Lord united 
His Human to the Divine itself He had peace. For now conflicts had come to an end and all things in the heavens and in the hells had been restored to order, so that not only did He Himself have peace 
but also angels in heaven and people on earth dwelt in peace and safety.  </p>

 Since these two processes are the all-embracing realities on which everything else in the Church is dependent, only 
the sanctifying of the sabbath, which serves to mean those two realities, is declared here<A name="fntext1"></a><A href="#fn1"><sup>a</sup></a>. For the most all-embracing reality is that the Lord has united His Human to the Divine itself, as a result 
of which a person can dwell in peace and safety. And it is also an all-embracing reality that a person should be joined to the Lord, which is effected through regeneration bringing him that peace and 
safety. This also was why the sabbath among the Israelite nation was the chief representative and was the chief sign of the covenant with Jehovah, that is, of being joined to the Lord, see <a href="10357.htm">10357</a>, <a href="10372.htm">10372</a>, 
a covenant being a joining together.

`Et in die septimo erit vobis sanctitas, sabbatum sabbati Jehovae': quod significet alterum statum regenerationis hominis cum ei conjunctio cum Domino, et quod in supremo sensu significet unionem Humani 
Domini cum ipso Divino, constat ex repraesentatione `sabbati' quod sit alter status regenerationis hominis cum homo in bono est, et sic a Domino ducitur, de qua n. 8510, 8890, 8893, 9274, et quod 
in supremo sensu sit unio Humani cum ipso Divino in Domino, de qua n. 8495, 10,356, 10,367, 10,374; cum enim Dominus in mundo fuit, primum fecit Humanum Suum Divinum Verum, {1}at cum exivit e mundo fecit 
Humanum Suum (x)Divinum Bonum per unionem cum ipso Divino quod fuit in Ipso; hoc repraesentatur per sabbatum in supremo sensu, quapropter dicitur `sabbatum sabbati Jehovae'; simile facit Dominus 
cum homine quem regenerat, primum imbuit illum veris et postea per vera conjungit illum bono {2}, ita Sibi; hoc repraesentatur per sabbatum in sensu (x)respectivo, nam {3}regeneratio hominis est imago 
glorificationis Domini, hoc est, sicut Dominus glorificavit Humanum Suum, ita regenerat hominem. 	[2] Per sabbatum in proprio sensu significatur quies ac pax, quia 2 cum Dominus univit Humanum Suum 
ipsi Divino, Ipsi fuit pax, cessaverunt enim tunc pugnae, {4}ac omnia in caelis et in infernis in ordinem redacta sunt; {5}et sic non modo Ipsi pax sed etiam pax et salus {6}angelis in caelis et hominibus 
in terris. 	[3] {7}Quoniam illa duo sunt ipsa universalia, ex quibus reliqua Ecclesiae pendent, ideo sanctificatio sabbati solum proponitur, per quod illa duo significantur; universale enim omnium 
est quod Dominus univerit Humanum Suum ipsi Divino, et quod inde pax et salus homini; et quoque universale est quod homo conjungendus sit Domino, quod fit per regenerationem, ut ei sit pax et salus; 
ideo quoque {8}sabbatum apud gentem Israeliticam fuit principale repraesentativum, ac principale signum foederis cum Jehovah, hoc est, {9} conjunctionis cum Domino, videatur n. 10,357, 10,372; foedus
