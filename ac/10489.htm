<h3 align="center" class="ired">属天的奥秘 第10489节</h3>
<h4 align="center"></h4><p><strong>10489</strong>.“在营中往来，从这门到那门”表凡有东西从内在之物敞开进入外在之物的地方。这从“往来”、“门”和“营”的含义清楚可知：“往来”是指从这一头到那一头考虑和环顾；“门”是指一个开口，如前所述（<a href="10483.htm">10483</a>节），因此，“从这门到那门”表示凡有东西敞开的地方；“营”是指地狱，如前所述（<a href="10483.htm">10483</a>节），因而也指外在之物，因为与内在之物分离的外在之物构成一个人里面的地狱。由此明显可知，“在营中往来，从这门到那门”表示他们必须考虑并环顾，看看凡有东西从内在之物敞开进入外在之物的地方。有必要在下一段阐明这一切的含义。与内在之物分离的外在之物之所以构成一个人里面的地狱，是因为天堂居于他里面的内在之物，如前所示（<a href="10472.htm">10472</a>节）；因此，外在之物当与天堂分离时，就构成地狱，这一切从以下事实看得更清楚：那些兴趣仅在于与内在之物分离的外在事物之人被地狱的爱，即自我之爱和尘世之爱主宰。此外，其外在与内在分离的人实际上就在地狱，尽管他活在世上时没有意识到这一点。</p>

Pass ye through and return from gate to gate in the camp. That this signifies wheresoever there is anything open from what is internal into what is external, is evident from the signification of "passing 
through and returning," as being to survey and look around from one end to the other; from the signification of "gate," as being an opening (of which above, n. 10483); thus "from gate to gate" denotes 
wheresoever there is anything open; and from the signification of "the camp," as being hell (of which also above, n. 10483), thus also what is external; for what is external separate from what is 
internal is hell with man. From this it is evident that by "pass ye through and return from gate to gate in the camp" is signified that they must survey and look around to see wheresoever there is anything 
open from what is internal into what is external. How the case herein is shall be told in the following article. That what is external separate from what is internal in man is hell, is because 
what is internal in him is heaven (as shown above, n. 10472); consequently what is external, when separated from heaven, is hell, as can be seen further from the fact that with those who are in external 
things separate from internal there reign infernal loves, which are the loves of self and of the world. Moreover, the man whose external is separated from what is internal is actually in hell, although 
he is unaware of this while he lives in the world. </p>

'Go to and fro from gate to gate in the camp' means wherever anything lies open from what is internal into what is external. This is clear from the meaning of 'going to and fro' as considering and looking 
around from one end to the other; from the meaning of 'gate' as an opening, dealt with above in <a href="10483.htm">10483</a>, so that 'from gate to gate' means wherever anything lies open; and from the meaning of 'the 
camp' as hell, also dealt with above in <a href="10483.htm">10483</a>, thus also what is external, for what is external separated from what is internal constitutes hell in a person. From these meanings it is evident that 'going 
to and fro from gate to gate in the camp' means considering and looking around wherever that which lies open from what is internal into what is external exists. The implications of this will be stated 
in the next paragraph. The reason why what is external separated from what is internal constitutes hell in a person is that heaven resides in what is internal in him, as shown above in <a href="10472.htm">10472</a>; consequently 
what is external when separated from that heaven constitutes hell. All this is made clearer still by the consideration that those who are interested only in external things separated from internal 
ones are ruled by hellish kinds of love, namely self-love and love of the world. Also the person whose external has been separated from his internal is in actual fact in hell, though he is not 
aware of it while he lives in the world.  </p>

`Transite et redite a porta ad portam in castris': quod significet ubicumque {1} aliquid apertum ab interno in externum, constat ex significatione `transire et redire' quod sit lustrare et circumspicere 
ab uno fine ad alterum; ex significatione `portae' quod sit apertura, de qua supra n. 10,483, ita `a porta ad portam' est ubicumque aliquid apertum; et ex significatione `castrorum' quod sint infernum, 
de qua etiam supra n. 10,483, ita quoque externum, nam externum separatum ab interno {2} est infernum apud hominem {3}; inde patet quod per `transite et redite a porta ad portam in castris' significetur 
quod lustrandum et circumspiciendum sit ubicumque est apertum ab interno in externum; quomodo cum his se habet, in articulo sequente dicetur. Quod externum separatum ab interno apud hominem 
sit infernum, est quia internum apud illum est caelum, ut supra n. 10,472 ostensum est; inde externum cum separatum est {4} a caelo, est infernum; quod ulterius constare potest ex eo quod apud illos qui 
in externis separatis ab internis {5} sunt, regnent amores infernales, qui sunt amores sui et mundi {6}, etiam homo cui externum separatum est ab interno, actualiter est in inferno, tametsi ille hoc 
nescit cum vivit in mundo. @1 i ubi$ @2 After est$ @3 apud hominem est infernum apud illum$ @4 separatur$ @5 interno$ @6 i , et quod vertant se a coelo et a Domino, ita ad infernum, videatur n.
