<h3 align="center" class="ired">属天的奥秘 第9293节</h3>
<h4 align="center"></h4><p><strong>9293.</strong> “不可空手朝见我的面”表出于怜悯对良善的接受，以及感恩。这从“耶和华的面”和“空手朝见”的含义清楚可知：“耶和华的面”是指良善，怜悯和平安（参看<a href="222.htm">222</a>，<a href="223.htm">223</a>，<a href="5585.htm">5585</a>，<a href="7599.htm">7599</a>节）；“空手朝见”或不带礼物而来是指作见证，因为良善已经被接受，以及感恩。因为献给耶和华的礼物表示一个人发自内心献给主，并蒙主悦纳的那类事物。礼物就像一个人的一切行为，这些行为本身无非是些动作举止，当脱离意愿来看待时，只不过是经过各种调节的关节运动，与机器运动没什么不同，因此是没有生命的。但与意愿一道来看待的行为就不是这类运动，而是展现在眼前的意愿的形式；因为行为无非是诸如构成意愿的那类事物的见证者。它们也从意愿获得其灵魂或生命。因此，论及运动的话也可以论及行为，即：除了意愿之外，行为中没有任何东西是有生命的，正如除了努力之外，运动中没有任何东西是有生命的一样。人类也知道情况就是这样，因为一个聪明人不关注一个人的行为，而是只关注他的意愿，就是行为的源头、手段和原因。事实上，一个智慧人几乎不注意行为，只在行为中看见其意愿的质和量。同样的道理也适用于礼物，因为主在礼物中所看到的，是意愿。正因如此，献给耶和华，也就是主的“礼物”表示诸如存在于意愿或心里的那类事物；人的意愿就是那在圣言中被称为“心”的。由此也明显可知，当如何理解马太福音（<a href="http://39-27.cn/太16.27.htm">16:27</a>）中的这一教导：在来世，各人要照各人的行为受审判；即：他会照着那些在他心里，并由此在他生活中的事物受审判。<br />“献给耶和华的礼物”表示这类事物，这一点从圣言明显看出来，如以下经文：<br />祭物和礼物，你不喜悦；燔祭和赎罪祭非你所要。我的神啊，我乐意照你的旨意行。（诗篇<a href="http://39-27.cn/诗40.6.htm">40:6</a>，<a href="http://39-27.cn/诗40.8.htm">8</a>）<br />申命记：<br />耶和华你们的神，祂是万神之神，万主之主，不徇情面，也不受礼物。（申命记<a href="http://39-27.cn/申10.17.htm">10:17</a>）<br />马太福音：<br />你在祭坛上献礼物的时候，若想起弟兄向你怀怨，就把礼物留在坛前，先去同弟兄和好，然后来献礼物。（马太福音<a href="http://39-27.cn/太5.23.htm">5:23</a>，<a href="http://39-27.cn/太5.24.htm">24</a>）<br />由此明显可知，献给主的礼物是对诸如发自内心献上的那类事物，也就是信与仁的事物的见证；“与弟兄和好”表示对邻之仁。<br /><br />有几个博士从东方来，他们拿黄金、乳香、没药为礼物献给新生的主。（马太福音<a href="http://39-27.cn/太2.1.htm">2:1</a>，<a href="http://39-27.cn/太2.11.htm">11</a>）<br />“黄金、乳香、没药”表示献给主的爱与信的一切事物；“黄金”是指爱之良善的形式；“乳香”是指信之良善的形式；“没药”是指外在事物中这二者的形式。东方智者之所以献上这些东西，是因为在一些东方人当中，自古以来就保留着古人的知识和智慧，这些知识和智慧就在于理解并看见在世界和大地上的那些事物里面的天上神性事物。事实上，古人十分清楚，一切事物都有对应关系，都具有代表性，因而有一个灵义，这从外邦人中最古老的书籍和历史遗迹也明显看出来。所以他们知道，黄金、乳香和没药表示当献给神的良善。他们还从其预言书，就是古教会的书（<a href="2686.htm">2686</a>节）知道，主要降世，那时有一颗星会向他们显现；同样是东方之子的巴兰也曾预言过这颗星（民数记<a href="http://39-27.cn/民24.17.htm">24:17</a>；<w1>3762<w2>3762<w3>节）；因为“星”表示关于内在良善和真理的认知或知识，这些认知或知识来自主（<a href="2495.htm">2495</a>，<a href="2849.htm">2849</a>，<a href="4697.htm">4697</a>节）。<br />大卫诗篇：<br />他施和海岛的列王都必带来礼物；示巴和西巴的列王都呈献贡品。众王都要叩拜祂；万族都要事奉祂。（诗篇<a href="http://39-27.cn/诗72.10.htm">72:10</a>，<a href="http://39-27.cn/诗72.11.htm">11</a>）<br />这些话论及主；“带来礼物”和“呈献贡品”表示爱和信的良善；因为“他施”表示关于爱和信的教义事物（<a href="1156.htm">1156</a>节）；“示巴和西巴”表示关于良善和真理的认知或知识（<a href="1171.htm">1171</a>，<a href="3240.htm">3240</a>节）；“众王”表示教会的真理（<a href="1672.htm">1672</a>，<a href="2015.htm">2015</a>，<a href="2069.htm">2069</a>，<a href="3009.htm">3009</a>，<a href="4581.htm">4581</a>，<a href="4966.htm">4966</a>，<a href="5044.htm">5044</a>，<a href="5068.htm">5068</a>，<a href="6148.htm">6148</a>节）；“万族”表示教会的良善（<a href="1159.htm">1159</a>，<a href="1258.htm">1258</a>-<a href="1260.htm">1260</a>，<a href="1416.htm">1416</a>，<a href="1849.htm">1849</a>，<a href="4574.htm">4574</a>，<a href="6005.htm">6005</a>，<a href="8771.htm">8771</a>节）。由此明显可知“众王都要叩拜祂；万族都要事奉祂”表示什么。<br />以赛亚书：<br />他们必将我的荣耀传扬在列族中。那时他们必将你们众弟兄从列族中作为礼物带给耶和华，或骑马，或坐战车，坐篷车，骑骡子，骑独峰驼，到我的圣山耶路撒冷，好像以色列人用洁净的器皿盛礼物奉到耶和华的殿中。（以赛亚书<a href="http://39-27.cn/赛66.19.htm">66:19</a>，<a href="http://39-27.cn/赛66.20.htm">20</a>）<br />人若不了解圣言的内义，就会以为这些话论及犹太人；因此，这些人要以这种方式被外邦民族带到耶路撒冷。但爱和信之良善才是这些预言所描述和“礼物”所表示的。带他们所用的“马”、“战车”、“篷车”、“骡子”和“独峰驼”表示理性概念，教义事物，以及关于真理和良善的记忆知识，这从它们的含义明显看出来，如从“马”的含义看出来（<a href="2760.htm">2760</a>-<a href="2762.htm">2762</a>，<a href="3217.htm">3217</a>，<a href="5321.htm">5321</a>，<a href="6125.htm">6125</a>，<a href="6401.htm">6401</a>，<a href="6534.htm">6534</a>，<a href="8029.htm">8029</a>，<a href="8146.htm">8146</a>，<a href="8248.htm">8248</a>节），从“战车”的含义看出来（<a href="5321.htm">5321</a>，<a href="5945.htm">5945</a>，<a href="8146.htm">8146</a>，<a href="8148.htm">8148</a>，<a href="8215.htm">8215</a>节），从“骡子”的含义看出来（<a href="2781.htm">2781</a>节）。<br />玛拉基书：<br />祂必坐下如炼净银子的，必洁净利未人，炼净他们像金银一样，他们就凭公义带礼物献给耶和华。那时，犹大和耶路撒冷的礼物，必蒙耶和华看为甜蜜，仿佛古时之日、往昔之年。（玛拉基书<a href="http://39-27.cn/玛3.3.htm">3:3</a>，<a href="http://39-27.cn/玛3.4.htm">4</a>）<br />由于“献给耶和华的礼物”表示爱和信的良善，故经上说“他们就凭公义带礼物献给耶和华”、“那时礼物必蒙耶和华看为甜蜜”；“洁净利未人，炼净他们像金银一样”表示将良善和真理从邪恶和虚假中洁净；“利未人”是指那些拥有信和仁，因而属于属灵教会的人（<a href="3875.htm">3875</a>，<a href="4497.htm">4497</a>，<a href="4502.htm">4502</a>，<a href="4503.htm">4503</a>节），“犹大”是指属天之爱的良善，因而是指那些处于这良善的人（<a href="3654.htm">3654</a>，<a href="3881.htm">3881</a>节）。</p>

And My faces shall not be seen empty. That this signifies the reception of good by virtue of mercy, and thanksgiving, is evident from the signification of "the faces of Jehovah," as being good, mercy, 
peace (see n. 222, 223, 5585, 7599); and from the signification of "not being seen empty," or without a gift, as being a testification on account of the reception of good, and, thanksgiving; for the 
gifts that were offered to Jehovah signified such things as are offered by man from the heart unto the Lord, and are accepted by the Lord. Gifts are like all man's deeds, which in themselves are nothing 
but gestures, and regarded apart from the will are merely movements that are fashioned in various ways, and as it were jointed, not unlike the motions of a machine, and thus devoid of life. But man's 
deeds regarded along with his will are not such motions, but are forms of the will shown before the eyes; for deeds are nothing else than testifications of such things as belong to the will; and they 
also have their soul or life from the will. And therefore the same can be said of deeds as of motions, namely, that there is nothing living in deeds except will, just as there is nothing living in 
motions except endeavor. That this is so, is also known to man; for he who is intelligent does not attend to a man's deeds, but only to the will from which, by which, and on account of which, the deeds 
come forth. Nay, he who is wise scarcely sees the deeds, but only the nature and amount of the will in them. The case is the same with gifts, in that it is the will in these which the Lord looks at; 
consequently by the gifts offered to Jehovah - that is, to the Lord - are signified such things as are of the will, or of the heart. Man's will is what is called in the Word his "heart." From all this 
it is also evident how it is to be understood that everyone will receive judgment in the other life according to his deeds or works (Matt. 16:27); namely, that it will be according to those things 
which are of the heart, and from this of the life. [2] That such things are signified by the gifts offered to Jehovah, is plain from the Word, as in the following passages: </p>
<p>     Sacrifice and gift Thou 
hast not desired, burnt-offering and sacrifice for sin Thou hast not required. I have longed to do Thy will, O my God (Ps. 40:6, 8).      Jehovah your God, He is God of gods, and Lord of lords, who 
accepteth not faces, and taketh not a gift (Deut. 10:17).      If thou offer thy gift upon the altar, and with this doth remember that thy brother hath something against thee, leave there thy gift 
before the altar, and go away; first be reconciled to thy brother, and then come and offer thy gift (Matt. 5:23, 24).  From this it is evident that gifts offered to the Lord were testifications of such 
things as are offered by the heart, which are those of faith and of charity; being "reconciled to a brother" denotes charity toward the neighbor. [3] Again: </p>
<p>     There came wise men from the East, 
and they offered to the newborn Lord gifts, gold, frankincense, and myrrh (Matt. 2:1, 11); </p>
<p>by "gold, frankincense, and myrrh" are signified all things of the good of love and of faith in the Lord; 
by "gold" those of the good of love; by "frankincense" those of the good of faith; and by "myrrh" those of both in things external. The reason why the wise men from the East offered these things, was 
that among some in the East there remained from ancient times the knowledge and wisdom of the men of old, which consisted in understanding and seeing heavenly and Divine things in those which are in 
the world and upon the earth. For it was known to the ancients that all things correspond and are representative, and consequently have a signification; as is also evident from the most ancient books 
and monuments of the Gentiles. Consequently they knew that gold, frankincense, and myrrh signify the goods which are to be offered to God. They also knew from their prophetic writings, which were of the 
Ancient Church (n. 2686), that the Lord was to come into the world, and that a star would then appear to them, of which star moreover Balaam, who also was one of the sons of the East, prophesied (Num. 
24:17; n. 3762); for a "star" signifies the knowledges of internal good and truth, which are from the Lord (n. 2495, 2849, 4697). [4] In David: </p>
<p>     The kings of Tarshish and of the Isles shall 
bring a gift; the kings of Sheba and Seba shall bring a present; and all kings shall bow themselves; and all nations shall serve Him (Ps. 72:10, 11); </p>
<p>these things were said of the Lord; by "bringing 
a gift," and "bringing a present," is signified the good of love and of faith; for "Tarshish" signifies the doctrinal things of love and of faith (n. 1156); "Sheba and Seba" signify the knowledges of 
good and truth (n. 1171, 3240); "kings," the truths of the church (n. 1672, 2015, 2069, 3009, 4581, 4966, 5044, 5068, 6148); and "nations," the goods of the church (n. 1159, 1258-1260, 1416, 1849, 4574, 
6005, 8771). From this it is evident what is meant by "all kings bowing themselves, and all nations serving Him."  [5] In Isaiah: </p>
<p>     They shall declare My glory among the nations; then shall they 
bring all your brethren out of all nations for a gift to Jehovah, upon horses, upon chariots, and upon litters, and upon mules, and upon dromedaries, to the mountain of My holiness Jerusalem; as the 
sons of Israel bring a gift in a clean vessel into the house of Jehovah (Isa. 66:19, 20); </p>
<p>he who is unacquainted with the internal sense of the Word may believe that these things were said of the Jews, 
and that these would therefore be brought to Jerusalem by the nations; but it is the goods of love and of faith in the Lord that are thus prophetically described; and the things meant by "a gift, 
horses, chariots, litters, mules, and dromedaries," upon which they were to be brought, are the intellectual, doctrinal, and memory things of truth and good, as is evident from their signification (of 
horses, n. 2760-2762, 3217, 5321, 6125, 6401, 6534, 8029, 8146, 8248; of chariots, n. 5321, 5945, 8146, 8148, 8215; and of mules, n. 2781). [6] In Malachi: </p>
<p>     He shall sit as a refiner and purifier 
of silver, and He shall purify the sons of Levi, and purge them as gold and silver, that they may bring to Jehovah a gift in righteousness. Then shall the gift of Judah and of Jerusalem be sweet to 
Jehovah, as in the days of old, and as in former years (Mal. 3:3, 4); </p>
<p>as by "a gift offered to Jehovah" is signified the good of love and of faith, therefore it is said that "they may bring to Jehovah 
a gift in righteousness," and that "then it will be sweet to Jehovah" "purifying the sons of Levi, and purging them as gold and silver" signifies the purification of good and truth from evils and 
falsities; "the sons of Levi" denote those who are in faith and charity, thus who are of the spiritual church (n. 3875, 4497, 4502, 4503); "Judah" denotes the good of celestial love, thus those who are 
in this good (n. 3654, 3881). </p>

<p align="center"><b>Elliott(1983-1999) 9293</b></p><p><b>9293.</b>
'And My face shall not be seen empty-handed' means the reception of good out of mercy, and thanksgiving. This is clear from the meaning of 'Jehovah's face' as good, mercy, and peace, dealt with in <a href="222.htm">222</a>, <a href="223.htm">223</a>, <a href="5585.htm">5585</a>, <a href="7599.htm">7599</a>; and from the meaning of 'not being seen empty-handed', or not coming without a gift, as bearing witness because good has been received, and thanksgiving. For gifts which were offered 
to Jehovah meant the kinds of things that are offered to the Lord by a person from the heart and are accepted by the Lord. The situation with those gifts is as it is with all a person's deeds. A person's 
deeds are merely acts performed by the body, and when regarded in isolation from his will are no more than variously regulated, so to speak articulated movements, not unlike the movements of a 
machine, and so are lifeless. But deeds regarded together with the will are not like those movements. Rather they are outward expressions of the will displayed before the eyes, for deeds are nothing other 
than witness-bearers to such things as compose the will. They also derive their soul or life from the will. Therefore something similar may be said of deeds as of movements, namely that nothing in 
deeds has life apart from the will, just as nothing in movements has life apart from endeavour. Mankind also knows this to be so, for someone endowed with intelligence pays no attention to a person's 
deeds, only to his will, the source, the means, and the reason for the deeds. Indeed someone endowed with wisdom scarcely notices the deeds but rather sees in the deeds what his will is like and how 
great it is. The same applies to gifts, in that in them the Lord looks on the will. So it is that by 'gifts' offered to Jehovah, that is, to the Lord, such things as are present in the will or the heart 
are meant, 'the heart' being what the Word calls a person's will. From all this it is also evident how to understand the teaching in <a href="http://bible.gospelcom.net/cgi-bin/bible?passage=Matt%2016:27&amp;version=ESV&amp;interface=print&amp;showfn=yes&amp;showxref">Matt 16:27</a> that everyone will receive judgement in the next life 
according to his deeds or works, namely that he will receive it according to what is in his heart and consequently his life.  </p>
<p></p>
<p><b>[2]</b>
 It is evident from the Word that such things are meant by 'gifts 
offered to Jehovah', as in David,  </p>
<blockquote>
Sacrifice and gift You have not desired; burnt offering and sin-sacrifice You have not sought. I have delighted to do Your will, O My God. <a href="http://bible.gospelcom.net/cgi-bin/bible?passage=Ps%2040:6,%208&amp;version=ESV&amp;interface=print&amp;showfn=yes&amp;showxref">Ps 40:6, 8</a>.  
</blockquote>
<p>In Moses, 
 </p>
<blockquote>
Jehovah your God, He is God of gods, and Lord of lords, who shows no partiality<A name="fntext1"></a><A href="#fn1"><sup>a</sup></a> and does not accept a gift.<A name="fntext2"></a><A href="#fn2"><sup>b</sup></a> <a href="http://bible.gospelcom.net/cgi-bin/bible?passage=Deut%2010:17&amp;version=ESV&amp;interface=print&amp;showfn=yes&amp;showxref">Deut 10:17</a>.  
</blockquote>
<p>And in Matthew,  </p>
<blockquote>
If you offer your gift on the altar, and there 
remember that your brother has something against you, you shall leave the gift there before the altar, and go away. First be reconciled to your brother, and then come and offer your gift. <a href="http://bible.gospelcom.net/cgi-bin/bible?passage=Matt%205:23&amp;version=ESV&amp;interface=print&amp;showfn=yes&amp;showxref">Matt 5:23</a>, 
<a href="24.htm">24</a>.  
</blockquote>
<p>From this it is evident that gifts offered to the Lord served to bear witness to things offered from the heart, which are those of faith and charity. 'Being reconciled to a brother' means 
charity towards the neighbour.  </p>
<p></p>
<p><b>[3]</b>
 In the same gospel,  </p>
<blockquote>
Wise men from the east came, and they offered gifts to the new-born Lord - gold, frankincense, and myrrh. <a href="http://bible.gospelcom.net/cgi-bin/bible?passage=Matt%202:1,%2011&amp;version=ESV&amp;interface=print&amp;showfn=yes&amp;showxref">Matt 2:1, 11</a>.  
</blockquote>
<p>'Gold, frankincense, 
and myrrh' means all forms of the good of love and faith offered to the Lord, 'gold' being forms of the good of love, 'frankincense' forms of the good of faith, and 'myrrh' forms of both in external 
things. The reason why 'wise men from the east' offered them was that among some in the east there remained from ancient times the knowledge and wisdom of the people of old, which consisted in 
their understanding and seeing heavenly and Divine realities within things in the world and on earth. For it was well known to the ancients that all things had a correspondence and were representative, 
and therefore had a spiritual meaning, as is also evident from the gentiles' oldest books and their monuments. This was how they knew that gold, frankincense, and myrrh meant the forms of good that 
should be offered to God. They knew also from their prophecies, which were those of the Ancient Church and which have been spoken of in <a href="2686.htm">2686</a>, that the Lord would come into the world, at which time a 
star would appear to them, about which also Balaam, who likewise was one of 'the sons of the east', prophesied, <a href="http://bible.gospelcom.net/cgi-bin/bible?passage=Num%2024:17%20-&amp;version=ESV&amp;interface=print&amp;showfn=yes&amp;showxref">Num 24:17 -</a> see <a href="3762.htm">3762</a>. 'A star' furthermore means cognitions or knowledge of internal goodness 
and truth, which come from the Lord, <a href="2495.htm">2495</a>, <a href="2849.htm">2849</a>, <a href="4697.htm">4697</a>.  </p>
<p></p>
<p><b>[4]</b>
 In David,  </p>
<blockquote>
The kings of Tarshish and of the islands will bring a gift, the kings of Sheba and Seba will bring a present; and all 
kings will bow down [to Him], and all nations will serve Him. <a href="http://bible.gospelcom.net/cgi-bin/bible?passage=Ps%2072:10,%2011&amp;version=ESV&amp;interface=print&amp;showfn=yes&amp;showxref">Ps 72:10, 11</a>.  
</blockquote>
<p>These things were said in reference to the Lord. 'Bringing a gift' and 'bringing a present' mean the good of love and 
faith. For 'Tarshish' means doctrinal teachings about love and faith, <a href="1156.htm">1156</a>; 'Sheba and Seba' cognitions or knowledge of goodness and truth, <a href="1171.htm">1171</a>, <a href="3240.htm">3240</a>; 'kings' the Church's truths, <a href="1672.htm">1672</a>, <a href="2015.htm">2015</a>, <a href="2069.htm">2069</a>,

<p>A person unacquainted with the internal sense of the Word may think that these things were said of the Jews who were to be brought in such a manner to Jerusalem by gentile nations. 
But forms of the good of love to and faith in the Lord are what those prophetic words describe and what 'a gift' is used to mean. 'Horses', 'chariots', 'covered wagons', 'mules', and 'fast runners' 
on or in which they were to be brought mean intellectual concepts, doctrinal teachings, and factual knowledge of truth and good, as is evident from the meaning of these carriers - for example, from 
that of 'horses', <a href="2760.htm">2760</a>-<a href="2762.htm">2762</a>, <a href="3217.htm">3217</a>, <a href="5321.htm">5321</a>, <a href="6125.htm">6125</a>, <a href="6401.htm">6401</a>, <a href="6534.htm">6534</a>, <a href="8029.htm">8029</a>, <a href="8146.htm">8146</a>, <a href="8148.htm">8148</a>; from the meaning of 'chariots', <a href="5321.htm">5321</a>, <a href="5945.htm">5945</a>, <a href="8146.htm">8146</a>, <a href="8148.htm">8148</a>, <a href="8215.htm">8215</a>; and from the meaning of 'mules', <a href="2781.htm">2781</a>.  </p>

He 
will sit as a refiner and purifier of silver, and He will purify the sons of Levi and purge them like gold, and like silver, in order that they may bring to Jehovah a gift in righteousness. Then 
the gift of Judah and Jerusalem will be acceptable to Jehovah, as in the days of old, and as in former years. <a href="http://bible.gospelcom.net/cgi-bin/bible?passage=Mal%203:3,%204&amp;version=ESV&amp;interface=print&amp;showfn=yes&amp;showxref">Mal 3:3, 4</a>.  
</blockquote>
<p>Since 'a gift offered to Jehovah' means the good of love and faith, it speaks 
here of their 'bringing to Jehovah a gift in righteousness' and of a gift 'acceptable to Jehovah'. 'Purifying the sons of Levi and purging them like gold and silver' means purifying goodness and 
truth from evils and falsities, 'the sons of Levi' being those who have faith and charity, thus who belong to the spiritual Church, <a href="3875.htm">3875</a>, <a href="4497.htm">4497</a>, <a href="4502.htm">4502</a>, <a href="4503.htm">4503</a>, and 'Judah' being the good of celestial love, 
thus those with whom that good exists, <a href="3654.htm">3654</a>, <a href="3881.htm">3881</a>.

`Et non videbuntur facies Meae vacue': quod significet receptionem boni ex misericordia et gratiarum actionem, constat ex significatione `facierum Jehovae' quod sint bonum, misericordia, pax, de qua 
n. 222, 223, 5585, 7599, et ex significatione `non videri {1} vacue' seu non absque munere, quod sit testificatio ob receptionem boni et gratiarum actio, nam munera quae offerebantur Jehovae significabant 
talia quae ab homine ex corde offeruntur Domino et acceptantur a Domino; (s)se habet cum muneribus sicut cum quibusvis factis hominis; facta hominis sunt modo gestus, et abstracte a voluntate spectata 
sunt solum motus varie formati et quasi articulati, non absimiles motibus machinae, ita, {2} inanimati; sed (o)facta una cum voluntate spectata non sunt tales motus sed sunt formae voluntatis coram 
oculis ostensae, nam facta non aliud sunt quam testificationes talium quae voluntatis sunt; et etiam {3} ex voluntate animam seu vitam suam habent; quapropter {4} de factis simile quod {5} de motibus 
dici potest, nempe quod nihil in factis vivat praeter voluntatem, sicut nihil in motibus praeter conatum; quod ita sit, etiam novit {6} homo, nam qui intelligens est, non ad facta hominis attendit 
sed solum ad voluntatem, ex qua, per quam, et propter quam, facta existunt; immo qui sapiens est vix facta videt sed in factis quale et quantum (x)voluntatis; similiter se habet cum muneribus, quod 
in illis voluntas spectetur a Domino; inde est quod per `munera Jehovae,' hoc est, Domino oblata, significentur talia quae sunt voluntatis seu cordis; voluntas hominis est quae (x)vocatur `cor' in Verbo 
{7}; ex his (o)quoque (m)patet quomodo intelligendum quod quisque secundum facta sua aut opera sua accepturus sit judicium in altera vita, Matth. xvi 27, quod nempe secundum illa quae cordis et inde 
vitae.(n)(s) 	[2] Quod talia per `munera (o)Jehovae oblata' significentur, patet {8} ex Verbo, ut apud Davidem, 	Sacrificium et munus non voluisti; holocaustum et sacrificium peccati non petiisti; 
facere voluntatem Tuam, Deus mi, desideravi, Ps xl 7, 9 [A.V. 6, 8]: </p>
<p>apud Moschen, 	Jehovah Deus vester, Ipse Deus deorum et Dominus dominorum, Qui non acceptat facies, et non accipit munus, Deut. 
x 17: </p>
<p>et apud Matthaeum, 	Si obtuleris munus tuum super altari, et apud hoc recordatus fueris quod frater tuus habeat aliquid contra te, relinques ibi munus coram altari, et abi, prius reconciliare 
fratri tuo, et tunc veniens offer munus tuum, v (x)23, 24; </p>
<p>inde patet quod `munera Domino oblata {9}' fuerint testificationes talium quae {10} corde offeruntur, {11} quae sunt fidei et charitatis {12}; 
`reconciliari fratri' est charitas erga proximum: [3] {13} apud eundem, 	Venerunt sapientes ex orientalibus, et Domino nato obtulerunt munera, aurum, tus, et myrrham, ii [1,] 11; </p>
<p>per `aurum, tus, 
et myrrham' significantur omnia quae boni amoris et fidei sunt in Dominum, `aurum' quae boni amoris, `tus' quae boni fidei {14}, et `myrrha' quae utriusque in externis; quod sapientes ex orientalibus 
{15} obtulerint illa, erat quia in orientalibus {16} apud quosdam {17} ex antiquis temporibus permansit scientia et sapientia veterum, quae fuit in illis quae in mundo et super tellure intelligere {18} 
et videre caelestia et Divina; nam notum antiquis fuit quod omnia corresponderent et repraesentarent, (c)ac inde significarent, ut patet etiam a gentilium antiquissimis libris et monumentis; inde erat 
{19} quod (o)sciverunt aurum, tus, et myrrham significavisse {20} bona quae offerenda Deo; sciverunt etiam ex propheticis suis, quae (x)fuerunt Antiquae Ecclesiae {21}, de quibus {22} n. 2686, quod 
Dominus in mundum venturus esset, et quod tunc apparitura illis stella, de qua etiam Bileamus, qui quoque ex filiis orientis erat, prophetavit, Num. xxiv 17, videatur n. 3762; (m)`stella' etiam significat 
cognitiones boni et veri {23} interni, quae a Domino, n. 2495, 2849, 4697:(n) [4] apud Davidem, 	Reges Tharschisch et insularum munus adducent, reges Schebae et Sebae donum afferent, et incurvabunt 
se omnes reges, et omnes gentes servient Ei, Ps lxxii 10, 11; </p>
<p>haec de Domino dicta sunt; per `munus adducere' et `(x)donum' afferre' significatur bonum amoris et fidei; nam `Tharschisch' significat 
doctrinalia amoris et fidei {24}, n. 1156, `Scheba et Seba' {25} cognitiones boni et veri, n. 1171, 3240, `reges' {26} vera Ecclesiae, n. 1672, 2015, 2069, 3009, 4581, 4966, 5044, 5068, 6148, et 
{27} `gentes' bona Ecclesiae, n. 1159, 1258-1260, 1416, 1849, 4574, 6005, 8771; inde patet quid intelligitur per quod `incurvabunt se omnes reges, et omnes gentes servient': [5] apud Esaiam, 	Annuntiabunt 
gloriam Meam in gentibus, tunc adducent omnes fratres vestros ex omnibus gentibus munus Jehovae super equis, et super curru, et super raedis cameratis, et super mulis, et super (x)veredariis, ad 
montem sanctitatis Meae Hierosolymam, quemadmodum adducunt filii Israelis munus in vase mundo domum Jehovae, lxvi 19, 20; </p>
<p>qui sensum internum Verbi non scit credere potest quod haec de Judaeis dicta 
sint et quod illi sic ad Hierosolymam a gentibus adducerentur; sed sunt bona amoris et fidei in Dominum quae ita prophetice describuntur et quae per `munus' intelliguntur; `equi,' `currus,' `raedae 
cameratae,' `muli,' et `veredarii,' super quibus adducendi, sunt (o)intellectualia, doctrinalia, et scientifica veri et boni, ut patet (c)a significatione illorum, ut `equorum,' n. 2760-2762, 3217, 5321, 
6125, 6401, 6534, 8029, 8146, 8148, (o)et ex significatione `curruum,' n. 5321, 5945, 8146, 8148, 8215, et ex significatione `mulorum,' n. 2781: [6] {28} apud Malachiam, 	Sedebit conflans et purgans 
argentum, et purificabit filios Levi, et defaecabit illos sicut aurum et sicut argentum, ut sint adferentes Jehovae munus in justitia; tunc suave erit Jehovae munus Jehudae et Hierosolymae juxta dies 
saeculi, et juxta annos priores, iii 3, 4; </p>
<p>quia per `munus oblatum Jehovae' significatur bonum amoris et fidei {29}, ideo dicitur quod sint `adferentes Jehovae (x)munus in justitia' et quod tunc 
`suave erit Jehovae munus'; `purificare filios Levi et defaecare illos sicut aurum et argentum significat purificationem boni et veri a malis et falsis; filii Levi {30} sunt qui in fide et charitate, 
ita qui ab Ecclesia spirituali, n. 3875, 4497, 4502, 4503, `Judah' est bonum amoris caelestis, ita qui in illo, n. 3654, 3881.                         @1 videre IT$ @2 i in se$ @3 inde quoque facta$ @4
