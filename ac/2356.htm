<h3 align="center" class="ired">属天的奥秘 第2356节</h3>
<h4 align="center"></h4><p><strong>2356.</strong>“罗得出来，到门口”表罗得谨慎行事。这从“门”和“出来到门口”的内义清楚可知。在圣言中，凡引入或允许进入真理、良善，或主的，就叫“门”。因此，“门”还表示真理本身，良善本身，以及主自己。因为真理通向良善，而良善通向主。这类事物由会幕和圣殿的门和幔子（参看<a href="2145.htm">2145</a>，<a href="2152.htm">2152</a>，<a href="2576.htm">2576</a>节）来代表。<br />这就是“门”含义，这从主在约翰福音中所说的话明显看出来：<br />人进羊圈，不从门进去，倒从别处爬进去，那人就是贼，就是强盗。从门进去的，才是羊的牧人；看门的就给他开门。我就是羊的门；凡从我进来的，必然得救。（约翰福音<a href="http://39-27.cn/约10.1.htm">10:1</a>-<a href="http://39-27.cn/约10.3.htm">3</a>，<a href="http://39-27.cn/约10.7.htm">7</a>，<a href="http://39-27.cn/约10.9.htm">9</a>）<br />此处“门”表真理与良善，因而表主，主是真理本身与良善本身。由此明显可知，被允许从门进入天堂表示什么，因而开门的钥匙表示什么。<br />然而，此处“门”表适用那些围住房子之人秉性的某种良善。因为此处“门口”（janua）不同于“门”（ostium），“门口”（janua）在房子外边，这从罗得出来，把身后的门关上的事实明显看出来。从下文明显可知，所说的这种良善就是生命的赐福，他凭这良善劝说那些处于虚假与邪恶的人。因为这些人不让自己被真正的良善本身所劝服，而是拒绝它。综上所述，明显可知“出来到门口”在此表示他谨慎行事。</p>

<p align="center"><b>Potts(1905-1910) 2356</b></p><p><b>2356.</b>
And Lot went out unto them to the door. That this signifies that he applied himself prudently, is evident from the interior sense of the expression "door," and of "going out to the door." In the Word 
a "door" signifies that which introduces or gives admission either to truth, to good, or to the Lord. Hence it is that a "door" signifies truth itself, good itself, and also the Lord Himself; for truth 
leads to good, and good to the Lord. Such things were represented by the door and veils of the Tent, and also of the Temple (see n. 2145, 2152, 2576). [2] That this is the signification of a "door," 
is evident from the Lord's words in John: </p>
<p>     He that entereth not by the door into the sheepfold, but climbeth up some other way, the same is a thief and a robber; but he that entereth in by the 
door is the shepherd of the sheep; to him the porter openeth. I am the door of the sheep; by Me if anyone enter in, he shall be saved (John 10:1-3, 7, 9). Here the "door" denotes truth and good, and 
therefore the Lord, who is truth itself and good itself. From this it is evident what is signified by being admitted into heaven through the door, and consequently what is signified by the keys with 
which the door is opened. [3] But in the present case by the "door" is signified some good adapted to the character of those who beset the house; for the "door" [janua] is here distinguished from the 
"door" [ostium], and was at the front of the house (as is evident from the fact that Lot went out and closed the door behind him) and from what immediately follows it is evident that the good in question 
was a blessedness of life by which he would persuade those who were in falsity and evil; for such do not suffer themselves to be persuaded by the veriest good itself, but reject it. From all which 
it is evident that by "going out to the door" is here signified that he applied himself prudently. </p>

<p align="center"><b>Elliott(1983-1999) 2356</b></p><p><b>2356.</b>
That 'Lot went out to them to the door (janua)' means that he acted cautiously is clear from the interior sense of 'the door' and of 'going out to the door'. 'A door' in the Word means that which introduces 
or leads the way either towards truth, or towards good, or towards the Lord. Consequently 'a door' in addition means truth itself, also good itself, as well as the Lord Himself, for truth leads 
to good, and good leads to the Lord. Such things were represented by the door and the veils of the Tent of Meeting, and also of the Temple, see <a href="2145.htm">2145</a>, <a href="2152.htm">2152</a>, <a href="2576.htm">2576</a>. </p>
<p></p>
<p><b>[2]</b>
 That this is the meaning of 'a 
door' is evident from the Lord's words in John, </p>
<blockquote>
He who does not enter by the door into the sheepfold but climbs in by another way, that man is a thief and a robber. But he who enters by the door 
is the shepherd of the sheep. To him the doorkeeper opens. I am the door of the sheep; if anyone enters through Me he will be saved. <a href="http://bible.gospelcom.net/cgi-bin/bible?passage=John%2010:-1-3,%207,%209&amp;version=ESV&amp;interface=print&amp;showfn=yes&amp;showxref">John 10:-1-3, 7, 9</a>. 
</blockquote>
<p>Here 'door' stands for truth and good, and so 
for the Lord who is truth itself and good itself. This shows what is meant by being let in through the door into heaven, and therefore what is meant by 'the keys' which unlock it. </p>
<p></p>
<p><b>[3]</b>
 Here however 
'a door' means a particular type of good that was suited to the disposition of those who besieged the house, for a distinction is made here between 'a door' (janua) and 'a door' (ostium). The former 
was on the outside of the house, as is evident from the fact that Lot went out and closed the door (ostium) behind him. This type of good was blessedness of life, as is clear from what follows shortly 
where he persuaded those who were immersed in falsity and evil. For such people do not allow themselves to be persuaded by actual good itself; indeed they reject it. From these considerations it is 
evident that here 'going out to the door' means that he acted cautiously. </p>

</p><b>2356.</b>
{1} Quod `exivit ad eos Lot ad januam' significet quod prudenter se applicaret, constat ab interiore sensu `januae,' et `exire ad januam'; `janua' in Verbo significat id quod introducit seu intromittit 
vel ad verum, vel ad bonum, vel ad Dominum; inde est quod etiam `janua' significet ipsum verum, tum ipsum bonum, ut et Ipsum Dominum, nam verum ducit ad bonum, et bonum ad Dominum; talia repraesentabant 
`janua et vela tentorii,' tum quoque templi, videatur n. 2145, 2152, 2576; [2] quod illa significatio sit januae, patet a Domini verbis apud Johannem, 	Qui non est ingrediens per januam in caulam 
ovium, sed ascendit aliunde, is est fur et latro; qui vero ingrediens est per januam, pastor est ovium; huic janitor aperit.  Ego sum janua ovium, ... per Me si quis introiverit, salvabitur, x 1-3, 
7, 9; </p>
<p>ibi `janua' pro vero et bono, ita pro Domino, Qui est ipsum verum et bonum.  Inde patet quid significatur per `intromitti per januam' in caelum, proinde quid per `claves' quibus aperitur. [3] 
Hic autem per `januam' significatur aliquod bonum, genio eorum qui obsiderunt domum, adaequatum, nam `janua' distinguitur hic ab `ostio,' et erat ante domum, quod patet ex ea quod Lot exiverit et quod 
ostium clauserit post se; et quod bonum illud esset beatum vitae, constat ab illis quae mox sequuntur, quo persuaderet illis qui in falso et malo erant; nam tales non persuaderi se patiuntur per ipsissimum 
bonum, id enim rejiciunt; ex quibus patet quod per `exire ad januam' hic significetur, quod prudenter se applicaret. 	@1 A has two versions of 2356-9, the former of which is deleted (see Appendix 
volume).$ </p>
