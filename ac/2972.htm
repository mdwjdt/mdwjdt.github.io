<h3 align="center" class="ired">属天的奥秘 第2972节</h3>
<h4 align="center"></h4><p><strong>2972.</strong>“并田间一切树木”表教会的内在认知。这从“树”和“田”的含义清楚可知。当论述属天教会时，“树”表直觉（参看<a href="103.htm">103</a>，<a href="2163.htm">2163</a>节）；当论述属灵教会时，“树”表认知（参看<a href="2722.htm">2722</a>节），在此则表内在认知，因为经上说“田间一切树木”，接着又说“四围边界”，“四围边界”表外在认知。“田”是指教会，如前所述。经上提及田间和四围边界的树是为了内义，否则，这在神性的圣言中不值一提。</p>

<p align="center"><b>Potts(1905-1910) 2972</b></p><p><b>2972.</b>
And every tree that was in the field. That this signifies interior knowledges of the church, is evident from the signification of a "tree," as being perceptions when the celestial church is treated of 
(see n. 103, 2163), but knowledges when the spiritual church is treated of (see n. 2722); here interior knowledges, because it is said "every tree that was in the field," and there then follows "that 
was in all the border thereof round about," by which is signified exterior knowledges; also from the signification of "field," as being the church (of which above). Mention is made of the tree that 
was in the field and in the borders thereof round about, on account of that internal sense; otherwise it would not be worthy of mention in a Word that is Divine. </p>

<p align="center"><b>Elliott(1983-1999) 2972</b></p><p><b>2972.</b>
'And every tree which was in the field' means the interior cognitions of the Church. This is clear from the meaning of 'a tree' as perceptions when the celestial Church is the subject, dealt with in <a href="103.htm">103</a> <a href="2163.htm">2163</a>, but cognitions when the spiritual Church is the subject, dealt with in <a href="2722.htm">2722</a> - interior cognitions here because the words 'every tree which was in the field' are used, followed by 'which was 
in all its borders round about', by which exterior cognitions are meant; and from the meaning of 'the field' as the Church, dealt with already. Mention is made of the tree in the field and in its borders 
round about for the sake of that internal sense; otherwise it would not have been worth any mention in the Word, which is Divine. </p>

</p><b>2972.</b>
`Et omnis arbor quae in agro': quod significet cognitiones Ecclesiae interiores, constat a significatione `arboris' quod sint perceptiones cum agitur de Ecclesia caelesti, de qua n. 103, 2163, at cognitiones 
cum agitur de Ecclesia spirituali, de qua n. 2722; hic cognitiones interiores quia dicitur `omnis arbor quae in agro,' et sequitur `quae in omni termino ejus circumcirca' per quae significantur 
cognitiones exteriores; et a significatione `agri' quod sit Ecclesia, de qua prius.  De arbore quae in agro et in terminis ejus circumcirca memoratur propter sensum illum internum, alioquin non memoratu 
digna in Verbo quod Divinum. </p>
