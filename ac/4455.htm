<h3 align="center" class="ired">属天的奥秘 第4455节</h3>
<h4 align="center"></h4><p><strong>4455.</strong>“但愿我在你们眼前蒙恩，你们向我要什么，我都会给”表若他们这一方和他想得一样。这从“在某人眼前蒙恩”的含义清楚可知，“在某人眼前蒙恩”是一个暗含倾向之意的短语（参看<a href="3980.htm">3980</a>节），在此是指给予他们向他所要的任何东西的一种强烈倾向。这些话表示若他们这一方和他想得一样，这一点从内义上的思维顺序明显看出来，因为就内义而言，“给他们所要的”表示在真理与良善方面与他们合为一体。</p>

<p align="center"><b>Potts(1905-1910) 4455</b></p><p><b>4455.</b>
Let me find grace in your eyes, and what ye say unto me I will give. That this signifies if they had a like mind on their side to what he had on his, is evident from the signification of "finding grace 
in one's eyes," as being a phrase that implies inclination (see n. 3980), here an inclination to this-that he would give whatever they said unto him. That by these words is signified that on his side 
there would be a mind to it if there were a like mind on theirs, is evident from the series in the internal sense, for in this sense "to give what they say" denotes to make a one with them in respect 
to truth and good. </p>

<p align="center"><b>Elliott(1983-1999) 4455</b></p><p><b>4455.</b>
'Let me find grace in your eyes, and I will give that which you tell me' means that if they on their part were similar in mind to him on his part. This is clear from the meaning of 'finding grace in 
someone's eyes' as a phrase implying a strong inclination, dealt with in <a href="3980.htm">3980</a>, here a strong inclination to give whatever they told him. The meaning of the words used here - if they on their part were 
similar in mind to him on his part - is evident from the sequence of thought in the internal sense, for 'giving that which they told him' in that sense means making one with them in truth and good. </p>

<p align="center"><b>Latin(1748-1756) 4455</b>
</p><b>4455.</b>
`Inveniam gratiam in oculis vestris, et quod dicitis ad me, dabo': quod significet si illis mens similis a sua parte, quod esset a sua, constat (c)a significatione `invenire gratiam in oculis alicujus' 
quod sit formula involvens propensionem, de qua n. 3980, hic propensionem ad id quod daret quicquid dicerent ad illum, per quae verba quod significetur, quod a sua parte esset mens, si similis 
a parte illorum, patet a serie in sensu interno, nam `dare quod illi dicunt' in illo sensu est unum facere cum illis quoad verum et bonum. </p>
