<h3 align="center" class="ired">属天的奥秘 第4635节</h3>
<h4 align="center"></h4><p><h4 align="center">第36章</h4><br />最后的审判（续）<br />4635.本章之前的各章头几节解释了主在马太福音24章对于教会末期的预言，马太福音的25章继续论述这个预言，因此，我现按照它们的次序解释这些问题的内义。字义上的内容如下：<br />那时，天国好比十个童女拿着灯出去迎接新郎。其中有五个是聪明的，五个是愚拙的。愚拙的拿着灯，却没有带油；聪明的拿着灯，又盛了油在器皿里。新郎迟延的时候，她们都打盹睡着了。半夜里有嚷叫的声音说，看哪，新郎来了！你们出来迎接他。那些童女就都起来修整她们的灯。愚拙的对聪明的说，请把你们的油分一点给我们，因为我们的灯要灭了。聪明的回答说，恐怕不够你我用的，不如你们自己到卖油的那里去买吧！她们去买的时候，新郎到了，那预备好了的，同他进去赴婚筵，门就关了。其余的童女随后也来了，说，主啊，主啊，给我们开门！他却回答说，我实在告诉你们，我不认识你们。所以，你们要警醒，因为人子来的那日子、那时辰，你们不知道。（马太福音<a href="http://39-27.cn/太25.1.htm">25:1</a>-<a href="http://39-27.cn/太25.13.htm">13</a>）</p>

Genesis 36 </p>
<p>THE LAST JUDGMENT </p>
<p>As in prefatory remarks to preceding chapters of Genesis there have been unfolded the Lord's predictions in Matthew 24 concerning the last time of the church, and as 
the same predictions are continued in Matthew 25, I may unfold these also in respect to the internal sense. These predictions as given in their order in the letter are as follows: </p>
<p>     Then shall the 
kingdom of the heavens be likened unto ten virgins, who took their lamps, and went forth to meet the bridegroom. And five of them were prudent, but five were foolish. They that were foolish, when they 
took their lamps, took no oil with them; but the prudent took oil in their vessels with their lamps. And while the bridegroom tarried, they all slumbered and slept. But at midnight a cry was made, 
Behold the bridegroom cometh, go ye out to meet him. Then all those virgins arose, and trimmed their lamps. But the foolish said unto the prudent, Give us of your oil, for our lamps are gone out. But 
the prudent answered, saying, Perchance there will not be enough for us and you; but go ye rather to them that sell, and buy for yourselves. And while they went away to buy, the bridegroom came; and 
they that were ready went in with him to the wedding, and the door was shut. Afterward came also the other virgins, saying, Lord, lord, open to us. But he answered and said, Verily I say unto you, I know 
you not. Watch therefore, for ye know not the day nor the hour wherein the Son of man cometh (Matt. 25:1-13). </p>

<p align="center"><b>Elliott(1983-1999) 4635</b></p><p><b>4635.</b>
The preliminary sections of the chapters of Genesis immediately before this one contain explanations of what the Lord foretold in Matthew <a href="24.htm">24</a> about the final period of the Church. This being what those 
sections contain, and because Chapter <a href="25.htm">25</a> of that gospel goes on to deal with the same matters, let an explanation now be given of the internal sense of those matters in the order in which they come, 
which in the letter is as follows, </p>
<blockquote>
Then the kingdom of heaven will be like ten virgins who took their lamps and went out to meet the Bridegroom Five of them however were wise, but five were foolish. 
Taking their lamps the foolish did not take oil with them, whereas the wise took oil in their vessels with their lamps. While the Bridegroom was tarrying they were all drowsy and went to sleep. At 
midnight there was a shout, Behold, the Bridegroom is coming; go out to meet Him. Then all those virgins were roused and they trimmed their lamps But the foolish said to the wise, Give us some of your 
oil, for our lamps are going out. But the wise replied, saying, Perhaps there will not be enough for us and for you; go rather to those who sell and buy for yourselves. While they were going to buy however, 
the Bridegroom came, and those who were ready went in with Him to the wedding feast; and the door was shut Afterwards the remaining virgins came also, saying, Lord, Lord, open to us. But He replying 
said, Truly, I say to you, I do not know you. Watch therefore, for you do not know the day, nor the hour, in which the Son of Man will be coming. <a href="http://bible.gospelcom.net/cgi-bin/bible?passage=Matt%2025:1-13&amp;version=ESV&amp;interface=print&amp;showfn=yes&amp;showxref">Matt 25:1-13</a>.

GENESEOS                      CAPUT TRIGESIMUM SEXTUM </p>
<p>Quia in praemissis ante capita Geneseos hactenus explicata sunt quae Dominus apud Matthaeum cap. xxiv praedixerat de ultimo tempore 
Ecclesiae, et quia apud eundem Evangelistam eadem continuantur {1}capite xxv, licet etiam illa suo ordine quoad sensum internum explicare quae in littera haec sunt: </p>
<p>     Tunc simile fiet 
regnum caelorum decem virginibus, quae      accipientes lampades suas exiverunt in occursum Sponsi: </p>
<p>     quinque autem erant ex illis prudentes, quinque vero stultae; </p>
<p>     quae stultae accipientes 
lampades suas non acceperunt secum      oleum; verum prudentes acceperunt oleum in vasis suis cum      lampadibus suis.  Tardante autem Sponso, dormitarunt omnes, et      obdormierunt: media autem 
nocte clamor factus est, Ecce      Sponsus venit, exite in occursum Ipsius: tunc excitatae sunt      omnes virgines istae, et adornarunt lampades suas: verum      stultae prudentibus dixerunt, 
Date nobis de oleo vestro, quia      lampades nostrae exstinguuntur; responderunt autem prudentes,      dicentes, Ne forte non sufficiat nobis et vobis; abite vero      potius ad vendentes et emite 
vobis ipsis; abeuntibus autem      illis ad emendum, venit Sponsus, et paratae ingressae sunt cum      Ipso ad nuptias, et clausa est {2}janua.  Postea vero veniunt      etiam reliquae virgines, dicentes, 
Domine, Domine, aperi      nobis; Ipse vero respondens dixit, Amen dico vobis, non novi      vos.  Vigilate itaque, quia non scitis diem, neque horam, in      qua Filius hominis venturus est,
