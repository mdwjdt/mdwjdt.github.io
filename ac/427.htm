<h3 align="center" class="ired">属天的奥秘 第427节</h3>
<h4 align="center"></h4><p><strong>427.</strong>第4:23节.拉麦对他两个妻子说：“亚大、洗拉，听我的声音；拉麦的妻子细听我的话语。我杀男人却伤自己，我害小孩却损自己。”<br />“拉麦”仍表荒废。“对他的妻子亚大和洗拉说，细听我的话语”表忏悔，有教会的地方才有忏悔，他的妻子就代表教会，如前所述。“我杀男人却伤自己”表他灭绝信，因为“男人”表信；“害小孩却损自己”表他灭绝仁。“伤”与“害”（或“损”）表不健全的状态；“伤”表信被荒凉，“害”表仁被荒废。</p>

<p><strong>[NCE]427.</strong> <a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_427/bible_king-james-version_genesis_4_23" target=_top>Genesis 4:23</a>. And Lamech said to his wives, Adah and Zillah, "Listen to my voice, wives of Lamech, and with your ears perceive what I say, because I killed a man for my wound and a little child for my bruise."<br />Lamech as before [<a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_427/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_405" target=_top>405</a>, <a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_427/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_406" target=_top>406</a>] symbolizes devastation. He said to his wives, Adah and Zillah, that they should perceive with their ears what he said, is an admission of guilt, which is made only where the church exists, the church being symbolized by his wives, as mentioned [<a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_427/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_409" target=_top>409</a>]. He killed a man for his wound means that he destroyed faith, a man symbolizing faith, as before [<a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_427/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_340" target=_top>340</a>, <a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_427/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_367" target=_top>367:1</a>]. Killing a little child for his bruise is destroying charity. The wound and the bruise mean that nothing was sound any longer, the wound meaning that faith had been abandoned and the bruise meaning that charity had been wiped out. </p>

Verse 23. And Lamech said unto his wives, Adah and Zillah, Hear my voice, ye wives of Lamech, and with your ears perceive my speech; for I have slain a man to my wounding, and a little one to my hurt. 
By "Lamech" is signified vastation, as before; that he "said unto his wives Adah and Zillah, With your ears perceive my speech" signifies confession, which can only be made where there is a church, 
which, as has been said, is signified by his "wives." "I have slain a man to my wounding" signifies that he had extinguished faith, for by a "man" is signified faith; "a little one to my hurt" signifies 
that he had extinguished charity. By a "wound" and a "hurt" (or "bruise") is signified that there was no more soundness; by a "wound" that faith was desolated; by a "hurt" that charity was devastated. </p>

<p align="center"><b>Elliott(1983-1999) 427</b></p><p><b>427.</b>
Verse 23 And Lamech told his wives Adah and Zillah, Hear my voice, O wives of Lamech, and with your ears perceive my speech that I have killed a man (vir) to my wounding, and a little one to my bruising. 
'Lamech', as previously, means vastation. 'He told his wives Adah and Zillah to perceive with their ears his speech' means confession such as is not otherwise made except where a Church exists, which, 
as has been stated, is meant by his wives.' He killed a man to his own wounding means that he annihilated faith, a man' meaning faith, as previously. 'A little one to his bruising' means that he 
annihilated charity. 'Wound' and 'bruise' mean a condition that was no longer sound, 'wound' meaning that faith had been desolated, and 'bruise' that charity had been laid waste.  </p>

</p><b>427.</b>
Vers. 23.  Et dixit Lamech uxoribus suis Adah et Zillah, Audite vocem meam uxores Lamechi, et auribus percipite dictum meum, quod virum occidi in vulnus meum, et parvulum in livorem meum.  Per 'Lamechum' 
significatur, ut prius, vastatio: 'quod dixerit uxoribus suis Adah et Zillah, ut perciperent auribus suis dictum ejus' est confessio, quae non aliter fit quam ubi Ecclesia, quae quod significetur 
per uxores ejus, dictum: 'quod virum occiderit in vulnus suum' significat quod exstinxerit fidem; per 'visum' significatur fides, ut prius: 'quod parvulum in livorem suum' est quod charitatem: per 'vulnus 
et livorem' significatur quod non integrum magis; per 'vulnus' quod desolata fides, per 'livorem' quod devastata charitas.            </p>
