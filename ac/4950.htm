<h3 align="center" class="ired">属天的奥秘 第4950节</h3>
<h4 align="center"></h4><p><strong>4950.</strong>在左脚下方稍微偏左的地方，诸如那种将一切都归于自然界，然而却又声称他们信至高无上的存在，就是那自然万物的创造者。但为了查看他们是不是真的信一位至高无上的存在，或创造万物的神明，于是便作出调查。我从他们传给我的思维发觉，他们所信的可以说就像某种根本没有任何生命的死物。由此清楚可知，他们并不承认一位宇宙的创造者，而是承认自然界。他们还说，他们对活神没有任何概念。</p>

Under the left foot, a little to the left, are such as have attributed all things to nature, but yet have made a confession of an Ens of the universe from which come all the things of nature. Exploration 
was made as to whether they had believed in any Ens of the universe, or Supreme Deity, that had created all things; but it was perceived from their thought communicated to me, that what they had 
believed in was like something inanimate, in which there was nothing of life; and from this it was evident that they had not acknowledged a Creator of the universe, but nature. They also said that they 
could have no idea of a living Deity. </p>

Slightly to the left beneath the left foot there are the kind of people who have attributed everything to nature, even though they proclaimed their belief in a supreme being who is the author of everything 
in the natural creation. But investigations were carried out to see whether they in fact believed in a supreme being or deity who had created all things. I perceived from their thought which was 
communicated to me that what they believed in was so to speak something inanimate possessing no life at all. From this it became clear that they did not acknowledge the creator of the universe but nature. 
They also said that they could not form any idea of a living deity. </p>

Sub pede sinistro paulo {1} sinistrorsum, sunt tales qui naturae omnia tribuerunt, at usque confessi ens universi ex quo omnia quae naturae sunt; sed explorabatur num crediderint aliquod ens universi 
seu summum numen quod creaverat omnia, sed perceptum ex cogitatione {2} (c)eorum mecum communicata, quod esset sicut inanimatum quoddam quod crederent in quo nihil vitae; ex quo constare potuit 
quod non agnoverint creatorem universi sed naturam; </p>
<p>dicebant etiam quod numinis vivi ideam non possent habere. @1 paulum$ @2 idea$ </p>
