<h3 align="center" class="ired">属天的奥秘 第9498节</h3>
<h4 align="center"></h4><p><strong>9498.</strong>“要把杠穿在环内”表神性气场的能力。这从“杠”和“环”的含义清楚可知：“杠”是指能力，如刚才所述（<a href="9496.htm">9496</a>节）；“环”是指与神性良善结合的神性真理，它在周围各个方向上，如前所述（<a href="9493.htm">9493</a>节），因而是指包围并容纳作为一个整体的天堂，具体的一切天堂社群和个体天使本身的神性气场，如前所示（<a href="9490.htm">9490</a>，<a href="9492.htm">9492</a>节）。因为从主的神性良善发出的神性真理不可想象为言语和其进入耳朵的流注，而要想象为从太阳发出的一个气场，该气场随着它离太阳越来越远而在热度和亮度上逐渐减弱，最终变得如此缓和，以致它适应了天使接受它的能力。天使天堂就在这个气场里面，但由于太阳的热度和亮度而远离这太阳。这个气场还延伸到天堂之外，直到地狱；然而，地狱里的人却不以正确的方式接受它，而是把它变为对立面。由此可见，包含并容纳天堂的神性气场是什么意思，即：是以这种方式从主的神性良善发出的神性真理，因而是与神性良善结合的神性真理，这真理在天堂周围和那些在天堂里的人周围的各个方向上。从显为天堂太阳的主发出的热是祂的神性之爱的神性良善，适合天上的天使接受它的能力；从显为太阳的主发出的光是祂的神性良善的神性真理。然而，这二者一起被称为“从主发出的神性真理”。</p>

And thou shalt put the staves into the rings. That this signifies the power of the Divine sphere, is evident from the signification of "staves," as being power (of which just above, n. 9496); and from 
the signification of "the rings," as being Divine truth conjoined with Divine good, which is everywhere round about (of which also above, n. 9493), thus the Divine sphere which encompasses and encloses 
heaven in general, and the heavenly societies and the individual angels themselves in particular, according to what has been before shown (n. 9490, 9492). For the Divine truth that proceeds from the 
Divine good of the Lord is not to be conceived of as speech and the influx thereof into the ear; but as a sphere from the sun, which by degrees, as it is removed from the sun, decreases in ardor and 
brightness, and at last becomes so tempered as to be accommodated to the reception of the angels. Within this sphere, but far from the sun on account of its ardor and brightness, is the angelic heaven. 
This sphere also extends outside heaven down into hell, but those who are there do not receive it in a suitable manner, but turn it into the opposite. From this it can be seen what is meant by the 
Divine sphere which encloses and holds together heaven, namely, that it is Divine truth conjoined with Divine good, which is everywhere around heaven, and around those who are in heaven. The heat that 
proceeds from the Lord as the sun in heaven is the Divine good of His Divine love accommodated to the reception of the angels who are in heaven; and the light that proceeds from the Lord as the sun 
is the Divine truth of His Divine good. Nevertheless both together are called "the Divine truth that proceeds from the Lord." </p>

'And you shall put the poles into the rings' means the power of the Divine sphere. This is clear from the meaning of 'the poles' as power, dealt with just above in <a href="9496.htm">9496</a>; and from the meaning of 'the 
rings' as Divine Truth joined to Divine Good, which lie in every direction round about, also dealt with above, in <a href="9493.htm">9493</a>, thus the Divine sphere which surrounds and embraces heaven as a whole, and every 
heavenly community and actual angel specifically, in accord with what has been shown already in <a href="9490.htm">9490</a>, <a href="9492.htm">9492</a>. For Divine Truth emanating from the Lord's Divine Good should not be envisaged as speech and 
its passage into an ear but rather as a sphere emanating from the sun, which gradually diminishes in heat and brightness as it gets further away from the sun, and eventually becomes so moderated that 
it is accommodated to angels' ability to receive it. Within this sphere, but far away from the sun on account of its heat and brightness, lies the angelic heaven. That sphere also extends outside heaven, 
right on into hell; those there however do not receive it in the right way but turn it into the opposite. From this it becomes clear what should be understood by the Divine sphere which embraces 
and contains heaven, namely Divine Truth emanating in that manner from the Lord's Divine Good, consequently Divine Truth joined to Divine Good, which lies in every direction round about heaven and round 
about those who are in heaven. The heat emanating from the Lord as the Sun there is the Divine Good of His Divine Love, accommodated to the ability of the angels in heaven to receive it; and the light 
emanating from the Lord as the Sun is the Divine Truth of His Divine Good. Both that heat and light however are called the Divine Truth emanating from the Lord.  </p>

</p><b>9498.</b>
`Et induces vectes in annulos': quod significet potentiam sphaerae Divinae, constat ex significatione `vectium' quod sint potentia: de qua mox supra n. 9496, et ex significatione `annulorum' quod sint 
Divinum Verum conjunctum Divino Bono, quae undequavis circum de qua etiam supra n. 9493, ita sphaera Divina, quae circumdat et includit caelum in communi, ac societates caelestes, ipsosque angelos 
in particulari, secundum illa quae prius n. 9490, {1}(x)9492, ostensa sunt; Divinum enim Verum procedens ex Divino Bono Domini non concipiendum est sicut loquela et ejus influxus in aurem, sed quemadmodum 
sphaera ex sole, quae per gradus sicut (c)ex sole elongatur, decrescit ardore et splendore, et tandem ita temperata fit, ut angelorum receptioni {2}accommodetur; intra hanc sphaeram, sed longe a 
sole ob ardorem et splendorem, est caelum angelicum; {3}illa sphaera quoque extra caelum se extendit, usque in infernum, at illi qui ibi non adaequate recipiunt illam, sed vertunt in contrarium; inde 
constare potest quid intelligitur per sphaeram Divinam quae includit {4}et continet caelum, quod nempe sit Divinum Verum ita procedens a Divino Bono Domini, consequenter Divinum Verum conjunctum Divino 
Bono, {5}quod undequavis circum caelum, et circum illos qui in caelo; calor procedens a Domino ut Sole ibi est Divinum Bonum Divini Amoris Ipsius, accommodatum receptioni angelorum qui in caelo, et 
lux procedens a Domino ut Sole est Divinum Verum Divini Boni Ipsius; utrumque tamen vocatur Divinum Verum procedens a Domino. @1 i et$ @2 accommodata sit$ @3 A is indistinct but appears to read: extra 
coelum si quoque illa extendit verum ibi adaequate non recipit, sed ab illis qui ibi vertitur in contrarium, ibi est infernum$ @4 , continet, et terminat$ @5 quae$ </p>
