<h3 align="center" class="ired">属天的奥秘 第3939节</h3>
<h4 align="center"></h4><p><strong>3939.</strong>“于是给他起名叫亚设”表它的根本性质。这从“起名”的含义清楚可知，“起名”是指根本性质，如前所述。根本性质本身就是“亚设”所代表的。在原文，“亚设”表“祝福”（blessedness）；但这个名字包含他母亲利亚所说“我有福啊，众女子都要称我是有福的”这句话所表示的一切事物在里面。也就是说，这个名字还表示属于情感并与永生的幸福相对应的快乐。这就是将外在人与内在人结合起来的第四个一般方法。事实上，当人在自己里面察觉到这种相对应的快乐时，他的外在人正开始与他的内在人结合。将它们结合起来的，正是对真理与良善的情感的快乐，因为没有情感的快乐，根本不会实现任何结合，人的生命就居于这些快乐里面。所有结合都是通过情感实现的（参看<a href="3024.htm">3024</a>，<a href="3066.htm">3066</a>，<a href="3336.htm">3336</a>，<a href="3849.htm">3849</a>，<a href="3909.htm">3909</a>节）。“众女子都要称她是有福的”表众教会；因为就圣言的内义而言，“女子”（或女儿，daughters）表示众教会（参看<a href="2362.htm">2362</a>节）。利亚之所以在此发出有福的感叹，是因为使女的生产表示作为服务于结合的方法的一般真理，旨在使教会在人里面形成。因为当人发觉这种快乐或情感时，他正在开始变成教会。正因如此，利亚才会在此对使女所生的第四个或最后一个儿子发出感叹。<br />在圣言中，“亚设”常被提及；但他和其他儿子一样，也表示这时所论述事物的根本性质，也就是说，正处在此处所论述状态下的那些人的根本性质。而且，这根本性质因所提及儿子的顺序而各不相同。当顺序从“流便”或信开始时，是一种性质，当顺序从“犹大”或属天之爱开始时，是另一种性质，当顺序从约瑟或属灵之爱开始时，则又是一种性质。因为为首者的本质和性质衍生并进入接下来的事物。这就是为何他们的属灵含义在提及他们的地方各不相同。在此处，也就是论述他们出生的地方，他们表示教会总体上的方方面面，因而表示构成教会的信与爱的一切。他们之所以具有这样的含义，是因为此前所论述的主题是人的重生，也就是人在变成教会之前的状态，就至高意义而言，所论述的主题是主，以及祂如何使祂的人身变成神性，因而是藉着雅各在伯特利所看见的直达耶和华的梯子的上升。</p>

And she called his name Asher. That this signifies its quality, is evident from the signification of "calling a name," as being quality-as above. The quality itself is that which Asher represents. "Asher" 
in the original language means "blessedness;" but the name involves all that is signified by the words of his mother Leah-"in my blessedness; for the daughters will call me blessed," namely, the 
delight of the affections which corresponds to the happiness of eternal life. This is the fourth general principle that conjoins the external man with the internal; for when a man perceives this corresponding 
delight within himself, his external man is then beginning to be conjoined with his internal man. It is the delights of the affections of truth and good that conjoin them; for without the delights 
of the affections nothing is conjoined, because the man's life is in them. (That all conjunction is through the affections, see n. 3024, 3066, 3336, 3849, 3909.) By the "daughters who call her 
blessed" are signified churches. (That in the internal sense of the Word "daughters" signify churches see n. 2362.) This was said by Leah because by the births from the handmaids are signified the general 
truths which are the means that are of service for conjunction, to the intent that the church may come forth in the man. For when a man perceives this delight or affection, he is beginning to become 
a church; and this being the case this is said of the fourth or last son of the handmaids.  [2] "Asher" is often named in the Word, but by him, as well as by the other sons, is signified the quality 
then treated of, that is, the quality of those in that state which is the subject there treated of; and the quality is also according to the order in which the sons are named, being of one kind when 
the order begins with "Reuben" or faith, of another when it begins with "Judah" or celestial love, and of another when with "Joseph" or spiritual love; for the essence and quality of that which is 
first is derived and passes on into the things which follow. This is the ground of their varying significations in the places where they are named. Here, where their birth is treated of, the general principles 
of the church are signified by them; and consequently all things of faith and love that make the church; and this for the reason that in what goes before, the regeneration of man is treated 
of, or man's states before he becomes a church; and in the supreme sense the Lord - how He made His Human Divine; and thus the ascent of the ladder which was seen by Jacob in Bethel, even to Jehovah. </p>

'And she called his name Asher' means the essential nature. This is clear from the meaning of 'calling the name' as the essential nature, as above. The essential nature itself is what 'Asher' represents. 
In the original language Asher means blessedness, but the name includes within it everything meant by the words of Leah his mother - 'in my blessedness! for the daughters will call me blessed'. That 
is to say, the name also means the delight that belongs to the affections and corresponds to the happiness of eternal life. This is the fourth general means which joins the external man to the internal 
man. Indeed when anyone perceives within himself that corresponding delight his external man is beginning to be joined to the internal. It is the delights belonging to the affections for truth and 
good which cause the internal man and the external to be joined together, for without such delights no joining together at all is achieved since it is within those delights that the person's life dwells. 
For affections are the means by which every joining together is effected, see <a href="3024.htm">3024</a>, <a href="3066.htm">3066</a>, <a href="3336.htm">3336</a>, <a href="3849.htm">3849</a>, <a href="3909.htm">3909</a>. By 'the daughters who will call her blessed' Churches are meant; for 'daughters' in the 
internal sense of the Word are Churches, see <a href="2362.htm">2362</a>. This exclamation about blessedness was made at this point by Leah because the births by the servant-girls mean general truths which are the means 
that serve to effect any joining together so that the Church may come into being in a person. For when a person perceives this delight or affection he is starting to become the Church. That being so, 
Leah's exclamation about the fourth or last son by the servant-girls occurs here. </p>

 Asher is mentioned in various places in the Word, but in those places - as with all the other sons also - the essential 
nature of the thing that is being referred to is meant by him, that is, the essential nature of people passing through the state under discussion at that point is meant. Also, what the essential 
nature is varies according to the order in which the sons are named. One thing is meant when Reuben or faith heads the list, another when Judah or celestial love does so, and yet another when Joseph 
or spiritual love. For the essence and nature of whichever one heads the list leads off and passes over into those that follow. This is why their spiritual meanings vary from place to place where they 
are mentioned. At this point where the birth of them is the subject they mean the general aspects of the Church and therefore all things of faith and love which constitute the Church. They have this 
meaning because the subject previous to this was the regeneration of man, that is, a person's states before he becomes the Church, and in the highest sense it was the Lord and how He made His Human 
Divine. So the subject is the ascent by means of the stairway even up to Jehovah which was seen in Bethel by Jacob. </p>

`Et vocavit nomen ejus Asher': quod significet quale, constat ex significatione `vocare nomen' quod sit quale, ut supra; </p>
<p>ipsum quale est quod `Asher' repraesentat; Asher in lingua originali significat 
beatitudinem, sed involvit omnia illa quae significantur per verba matris ejus Leae, `in beatitudine mea quia beatificabunt me filiae,' nempe jucundum affectionum correspondens felicitati vitae 
aeternae; est hoc quartum {1}commune quod externum hominem eum interno conjungit; cum enim homo percipit in se jucundum illud correspondens, tunc incipit externus ejus homo conjungi interno; sunt 
{2}jucunda quae sunt affectionum veri et boni, quae conjungunt, nam absque jucundis affectionum nihil conjungitur, est enim in illis vita hominis; quod per affectiones omnis conjunctio, videatur 
n. (x)3024, 3066, 3336, 3849, 3909; per `filias quae beatificabunt' significantur Ecclesiae; quod `filiae' {3}in sensu interno verbi sint Ecclesiae, videatur n. 2362.  Hoc nunc dictum est a Lea, quia 
per `partus ancillarum' significantur vera communia quae sunt media inservientia conjunctioni, ut existat apud hominem Ecclesia; cum enim homo id jucundum seu illam affectionem percipit, tunc incipit 
ille Ecclesia fieri, et quia ita, dicitur hoc de quarto seu ultimo illo ex ancillis.  [2] In Verbo passim nominatur Asher, sed ibi significatur per illum, ut quoque per reliquos, quale de quo 
ibi agitur, hoc est, quales sunt in illo statu, de quo res ibi est; et quoque se habet quale eorum secundum ordinem in quo nominantur, sicut aliter cum a Reubene seu fide principium ducitur, aliter 
cum a Jehuda seu amore caelesti, et aliter cum a Josepho seu ab amore spirituali; nam essentia et qualitas principii derivatur et transit in sequentes; inde significationes eorum variae in locis 
ubi nominantur: hic ubi de nativitate eorum agitur, per {4}illos significantur communia Ecclesiae, proinde omnia fidei et amoris quae faciunt Ecclesiam; et hoc ex causa quia in illis quae praecedunt, 
agitur de regeneratione hominis, seu de statibus hominis antequam fit Ecclesia, et in supremo sensu de {5}Domino, quomodo Humanum Suum Divinum fecit; ita de ascensu per scalam quae in Bethel visa 
est Jacobo, usque ad Jehovam. @1 i medium$ @2 i enim$ </p>
<p>@3 These words after Ecclesiae$ @4 duodecim$ @5 Humano Domini, quomodo illud$ </p>
