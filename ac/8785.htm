Verses 10-13. And Jehovah said unto Moses, Go unto the people, and sanctify them today and tomorrow, and let them wash their garments. And let them be ready against the third day; because in the third 
day Jehovah will come down unto the eyes of all the people upon Mount Sinai. And thou shalt set bounds to the people round about, saying, Take heed to yourselves, that ye go not up into the mountain, 
or touch the extremity of it; everyone that toucheth the mountain, dying he shall die. No hand shall touch it, because stoning he shall be stoned, or shooting he shall be shot; if a beast, if a man, 
he shall not live: when the jobel is drawn out, they shall come up into the mountain. "And Jehovah said unto Moses," signifies a revelation about the preparation; "Go unto the people," signifies conjunction; 
"and sanctify them today and tomorrow," signifies the veiling over of the interiors that they may appear in the holy of faith now and afterward; "and let them wash their garments," signifies 
the purification of their truths; "and let them be ready against the third day," signifies thus full preparation; "because in the third day," signifies because in the end when they are prepared to receive; 
"Jehovah will come down unto the eyes of all the people," signifies the coming of the Lord, and enlightenment then; "upon Mount Sinai," signifies in the good in which truth is to be implanted; "and 
thou shalt set bounds to the people round about," signifies extension into heaven no further than to the spiritual spheres of good; "saying, Take heed to yourselves, that ye go not up into the mountain," 
signifies no extension whatever to the celestial societies which are in the love of good; "or touch the extremity of it," signifies not even to the intermediate things; "everyone that toucheth 
the mountain, dying he shall die," signifies that whosoever of the spiritual church inserts himself as far as the celestial societies will perish; "no hand shall touch it," signifies that they who insert 
themselves through any self-confidence; "because stoning he shall be stoned," signifies that thus the truths of faith which they have will perish; "or shooting he shall be shot," signifies that spiritual 
good also will perish; "if a beast, if a man, he shall not live," signifies that good and truth will lose their spiritual life; "when the jobel is drawn out," signifies with those who have a 
general perception of celestial good; "they shall come up into the mountain," signifies extension as far as the celestial societies. </p>

Verses 10-13 And Jehovah said to Moses, Go to the people, and sanctify them today and tomorrow; and let them wash their garments. And they will be ready by the third day; for on the third day Jehovah 
will come down before the eyes of all the people onto Mount Sinai. And you are to set bounds for the people round about, saying, Take care not to go up into the mountain or to touch the border of it, 
everyone touching the mountain will surely die. Let no hand touch it, for he will surely be stoned or will be killed by being shot with arrows; whether it is a beast or a man, it shall not live. When 
there is a long sounding with the jobel<A name="fntext1"></a><A href="#fn1"><sup>a</sup></a> they shall go up into the mountain. </p>
<p>'And Jehovah said to Moses' means revelation regarding preparation. 'Go to the people' means a joining together. 'And sanctify 
them today and tomorrow' means covering over their interiors in order that those people may appear now and subsequently in the holiness of faith. 'And let them wash their garments' means the purification 
of truths. 'And they will be ready by the third day' means thus full and complete preparation. 'For on the third day' means because at the end, when they have been prepared to receive ... 
'Jehovah will come down before the eyes of all the people' means, the coming of the Lord will occur, and enlightenment at that time. 'Onto Mount Sinai' means into the good in which truth is to be implanted. 
'And you are to set bounds for the people round about' means not extending into heaven beyond the spiritual spheres of good. 'Saying, Take care not to go up into the mountain' means that there 
must be no extension whatever to celestial communities which have the love of good. 'Or to touch the border of it' means that there must be no extension even to intermediate parts. 'Everyone touching 
the mountain will surely die' means that anyone belonging to the spiritual Church who forces his way through to celestial communities will be destroyed. 'Let no hand touch it' means those who have enough 
arrogant self-confidence to force their way through 'For he will surely be stoned' means that as a result the truths of faith which they possess will be destroyed. 'Or will be killed by being shot 
with arrows' means that spiritual good too [will be destroyed] 'Whether it is a beast or a man, it shall not live' means that goodness and truth will lose their spiritual life. 'When there is a long 
sounding with the jobel' means those who have a general perception of celestial good. 'They shall go up into the mountain' means extension all the way to those who are celestial.

Vers. 10-13.  Et dixit Jehovah ad Moschen, Abi ad populum, et sanctifica illos hodie et cras, et lavent vestes suas.  Et erunt parati ad diem tertium, quia in die tertio descendet Jehovah ad oculos 
omnis populi super montem Sinai.  Et terminos ponas populo circumcirca, dicendo, Cavete vobis ascendere in montem et tangere extremitatem ejus; omnis tangens montem moriendo morietur.  Non tangat illum 
manus, quia lapidando lapidabitur, aut jaculando jaculis conficietur; si bestia si vir non vivet; in trahendo jobel illi ascendent in montem.  `Et dixit Jehovah ad Moschen' significat revelationem de 
praeparatione: `Abi ad populum' significat conjunctionem: `et sanctifica illos hodie et cras' significat obvelationem interiorum ut in fidei sancto appareant nunc et postea: `et lavent vestes suas' 
significat purificationem verorum: `et erunt parati ad diem tertium' significat praeparationem sic plenariam: `quia in die tertio' significat quoniam in fine cum praeparati ad recipiendum: `descendet 
Jehovah ad oculos omnis populi' significat adventum Domini et tunc illustrationem: `super montem Sinai' significat in bonum cui verum implantandum: `et terminos ponas populo circumcirca' (x)significat 
extensionem in caelum non ultra quam ad sphaeras spirituales boni: `dicendo, Cavete vobis ascendere in montem' significat quod omnino non ad societates caelestes quae in amore boni: `et tangere extremitatem 
ejus' (x)significat quod ne quidem ad intermedia: `omnis tangens montem moriendo morietur' significat quod qui ab Ecclesia spirituali usque ad societates caelestes se infundit pereat: `non tanget 
illum manus' significat quod qui per aliquam confidentiam sui [se] (x)infundunt: `quia lapidando lapidabitur' significat quod sic vera fidei quae eis, pereant: `et jaculando jaculis conficietur' significat 
quod etiam spirituale bonum [pereat]: `si bestia si vir non vivet' significat quod bonum et verum vitam spiritualem amittat: `in trahendo jobel' significat quibus perceptio communis boni caelestis: 
`illi ascendent in montem' significat extensionem usque ad caelestes. </p>
