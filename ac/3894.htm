<h3 align="center" class="ired">属天的奥秘 第3894节</h3>
<h4 align="center"></h4><p><strong>3894.</strong>由于天使和灵人的呼吸完全取决于他们的爱和源于这爱的信之状态，如前所述（<a href="3892.htm">3892</a>节），故没有哪两个社群的呼吸是一样的。处于自我之爱和尘世之爱的，并由此处于虚假的恶者无法与善者相伴。一旦靠近善者，他们就觉得自己好像无法呼吸，可以说被窒息了。结果，他们像半死不活的人，或石头那样沉入地狱，在那里重获呼吸能力，这种呼吸是他们和那些早就在那个地方的人所共有的。由此可见，凡沉浸于邪恶与虚假者，都无法待在大人或天堂。因为当他们靠近时，其呼吸就开始停止，其洞察和思维也停止，其一切行恶言假的努力同样停止。其伴随这种努力的全部行为和生命运动都会消失。因此，他们什么也做不了，只能从那里一头栽下去。 <br />3894a.由于这是实情，还由于善良的人一进入来世，首先被带回到他们在世时所拥有的生命中（参看<a href="2119.htm">2119</a>节） ，因此也被带回到那生命的爱欲和乐趣中，故他们无法移到天使当中，与他们共呼吸，因为他们还没有为此做好预备。因此，他们在经历这种预备时，首先通过与天使和谐一致的呼吸被引入天使的生命，与此同时进入内在感知和天堂的自由中。这一切在一个由许多人组成的社群或唱诗班进行，在那里，没有哪两个成员的呼吸、感知和自由行动的方式是一模一样的。实现这一切的方式也直观地向我展示了。</p>

It was said above (n. 3892), that the respirations of angels and spirits are altogether according to their states of love and of the derivative faith. Hence one society does not respire in the same manner 
as another; and the evil, who are in the love of self and of the world, and thereby in what is false, cannot abide in company with the good; but when they come near them they seem to themselves 
unable to breathe, and as it were to be suffocated; in consequence whereof they fall down like persons half dead, or like stones, even into hell, where they again receive their respiration, which they 
have in common with those who are there. From this we can see that they who are in evil and falsity cannot be in the Grand Man, or in heaven; for when on their approaching it their respiration begins 
to cease, all their observation and thought also cease, and likewise all their endeavor to do what is evil and to persuade what is false; and together with the endeavor there perish all their action 
and vital motion, so that they can do no otherwise than cast themselves down headlong thence. </p>
<p>3894a. Because this is so, and because the well-disposed on their entrance into the other life are first 
remitted into the life which they had in the world (see n. 2119), thus also into the loves and pleasures of that life, therefore they cannot as yet, before they are prepared, be in fellowship with angels, 
even as to respiration. For this reason, when they are being prepared, they are first inaugurated into angelic life by concordant respirations, and then they come at the same time into interior 
perceptions and into heavenly freedom. This is effected in a society of many, or in choirs, in which the one respires in the same way as the others and also perceives in the same way, and in the same 
way acts from freedom. How this is effected has also been shown me to the life. </p>

<p align="center"><b>Elliott(1983-1999) 3894</b></p><p><b>3894.</b>
Since the breathing of angels and spirits is determined entirely by their states of love and of faith deriving from it, as stated above in <a href="3892.htm">3892</a>, one community does not therefore breathe in the same way 
as another. Nor can the evil who are governed by self-love and love of the world and as a consequence by falsity share the company of the good. When they come near the good it seems to them as though 
they are unable to breathe and are so to speak being suffocated. As a consequence they sink down like somebody half-dead, and so like stones, into hell where they regain their ability to breathe along 
with those who are already in that place. From this it may be seen that those immersed in evil and falsity cannot be in the Grand Man or heaven, for when their breathing starts to falter as they are 
approaching heaven all their discernment and thought too starts to falter, as well as all their effort to perform what is evil and press what is false. And with that effort their whole action and impetus 
perishes. Consequently they are unable to do anything else but cast themselves down headlong from that place. </p>
<p><a href="3894.htm">3894</a>[a] Because this is the case, and because the upright on entering the next life 
are first of all taken back to the life which had been theirs in the world, <a href="2119.htm">2119</a>, and so are also taken back to the desires and pleasures of that life, they cannot move among angels and breathe with 
them, for the reason that they have not yet undergone preparation for this. So when they undergo such preparation they are first of all introduced into angelic life by means of their taking breaths 
in unison with angels, and as they do so they enter at the same time into interior perceptions and into heavenly freedom. This takes place in a community consisting of many, that is, in choirs, in which 
one member breathes in the same way as another, and also perceives in the same way, and in the same way acts in freedom. And the way in which this is effected I have been shown visually. </p>

{1}  Quia ut supra n. 3892 dictum, respirationes angelorum et spirituum se habent prorsus secundum statas eorum amoris et inde fidei, inde est quod una societas non respiret similiter ac altera; </p>
<p>tum 
quod mali qui in amore sui et mundi et inde in falso sunt, non possint interesse bonorum consortio, sed cum ad illos accedunt, videantur sibi non posse respirare, sed quasi suffocari, et quod inde 
ut semimortui ac sicut lapides decidant usque in infernum, ubi rursus suam respirationem recipiunt, quam communem habent cum illis qui ibi; inde constare potest quod illi qui in malo et falso sunt, non 
possint esse in Maximo Homine seu in caelo, cum enim respiratio illorum ad approximationem illuc {2} cessare incipit, tunc quoque omnis illorum apperceptio et cogitatio, et quoque omnis illorum conatus 
faciendi malum et persuadendi falsum, et cum conatu {3} perit illis omnis actio et motus vitalis, quare non possunt aliter quam se praecipites inde dejicere. @1 A has 3893, I 3894, both 
have 3894 for next number.$ @2 ibi$ @3 ad malum faciendum et ad falsum persuadendum, imo$ </p>
<p>3894a.  Quia ita est, et probi dum in alteram vitam veniunt, primum remittuntur in vitam quam in mundo 
habuerunt, n. 2119, ita quoque in amores et voluptates illius vitae; ideo nondum antequam praeparati sunt, in consortio angelorum possunt esse, etiam quoad respirationem; quapropter cum praeparantur, 
primum inaugurantur in vitam angelicam per concordes respirationes, et simul tunc veniunt in perceptiones interiores et in liberum caeleste: hoc fit in societate (x)plurium, seu in choris, in quibus 
unus respirat similiter ac alter, tum similiter percipit, et similiter ex libero agit; quod quomodo fit, etiam ad vivum mihi ostensum est. </p>
