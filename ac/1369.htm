<h3 align="center" class="ired">属天的奥秘 第1369节</h3>
<h4 align="center"></h4><p><strong>1369.</strong>创世记11:29. 亚伯兰、拿鹤各娶了妻；亚伯兰的妻子名叫撒莱；拿鹤的妻子名叫密迦，是哈兰的女儿，哈兰是密迦的父亲和亦迦的父亲。<br />“亚伯兰、拿鹤各娶了妻；亚伯兰的妻子名叫撒莱；拿鹤的妻子名叫密迦，是哈兰的女儿，哈兰是密迦的父亲和亦迦的父亲”表偶像崇拜中邪恶与虚假的苟合，它们就具有此处所表明的这种关系。丈夫表邪恶，妻子表虚假。</p>

<p><strong>[NCE]1369.</strong> <a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_1369/bible_king-james-version_genesis_11_29" target=_top>Genesis 11:29</a>. And Abram and Nahor took themselves wives; the name of Abram's wife was Sarai, and the name of Nahor's wife was Milcah daughter of Haran (the father of Milcah and the father of Iscah).<br />Abram and Nahor took themselves wives and the name of Abram's wife was Sarai, and the name of Nahor's wife was Milcah daughter of Haran (the father of Milcah and the father of Iscah) symbolizes evil and falsity wedded in idolatrous worship — a union that resembles these marriages. The husbands symbolize different kinds of evil and the wives symbolize different kinds of falsity. </p>

Verse 29. And Abram and Nahor took them wives; and the name of Abram's wife was Sarai; and the name of Nahor's wife, Milcah, the daughter of Haran, the father of Milcah, and the father of Iscah. "And 
Abram and Nahor took them wives; and the name of Abram's wife was Sarai; and the name of Nahor's wife, Milcah, the daughter of Haran, the father of Milcah, and the father of Iscah," signifies marriages 
of evil with falsity in idolatrous worship; which stand in the relationship here indicated. By the husbands are signified evils; by the wives, falsities. </p>

Verse 29 And Abram and Nahor took to themselves wives; the name of Abram's wife was Sarai, and the name of Nahor's wife was Milkah, the daughter of Haran, Milkah's father and Iskah's father. </p>
<p>'Abram 
and Nahor took to themselves wives, and the name of Abram's wife was Sarai, and the name of Nahor's wife was Milkah, the daughter of Haran, Milkah's father and Iskah's father' means marriages of evil 
and falsity in idolatrous worship, the relationships being as stated here. The husbands mean evils, and the wives falsities. </p>

<p align="center"><b>Latin(1748-1756) 1369</b>
</p><b>1369.</b>
Vers. 29. Et accepit Abram et Nahor sibi uxores; nomen uxoris Abrami Sarai, et nomen uxoris Nahoris Milkah, filia Haranis patris Milkae, et patris Jiskae. 'Quod acceperit Abram et Nahor: sibi uxores, 
et nomen uxoris Abrami Sarai; et nomen uxoris Nahori' Milkah, filia Haranis patris Milkae, et patris Jiskae' significant conjugia mali cum falso in cultu idololatrico, quae ita se habent; per 'maritos' 
significantur mala, per 'uxores' falsa. </p>
