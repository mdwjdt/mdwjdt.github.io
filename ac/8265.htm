<h3 align="center" class="ired">属天的奥秘 第8265节</h3>
<h4 align="center"></h4><p><strong>8265.</strong>“将马和骑马的投在海中”表仅仅因为祂的同在，邪恶所生的虚假就受到诅咒，并被投入地狱。这从“马”、“骑马的”或“马兵”和“投在海中”的含义清楚可知：“马”是指属于一种败坏理解力的虚假，因为“马”表示理解力（参看<a href="2761.htm">2761</a>，<a href="2762.htm">2762</a>，<a href="3217.htm">3217</a>，<a href="5321.htm">5321</a>节），在反面意义上表示一种败坏的理解力，这根本不是理解力，所以“马”在反面意义上表示虚假，而“法老的马”表示虚假的记忆知识（<a href="6125.htm">6125</a>，<a href="8146.htm">8146</a>，<a href="8148.htm">8148</a>节）；“骑马的”或“马兵”是指基于虚假记忆知识的推理（<a href="8146.htm">8146</a>，<a href="8148.htm">8148</a>节）；“投在海中”是指诅咒并投入地狱。“海”，此处即红海，是指那些属于教会，陷入分离之信，并过着一种邪恶生活的人所在的地狱（参看<a href="8099.htm">8099</a>，<a href="8137.htm">8137</a>，<a href="8148.htm">8148</a>节）；这就是为何它们被称为邪恶所生的虚假。这些虚假仅仅因为主的同在，就受到诅咒，并被投入地狱，这一事实在前一章已经说明。恶人根本无法承受或忍受神的同在，因为神的同在会使他们痛苦，折磨他们，可以说扼杀他们的生命；他们的举止行为就像那些垂死挣扎的人。原因在于，神的东西拥有全能在里面；这全能会摧毁并除灭与它对立之物，即虚假和邪恶。这就是为何在神面前，那些沉浸于虚假和邪恶之人的生命会变得困苦、沉重，并照着神同在的程度而感觉地狱在自己里面。不过，为叫那些沉浸于虚假和邪恶的人不至于被完全压碎并遭受折磨，他们就被自己的虚假和邪恶遮蔽，如同被雾霭笼罩。这些虚假和邪恶具有这样的性质，它们会减弱、转移，或窒息神性之物的流注，正如尘世的云雾通常对阳光所行的那样。<br />启示录中的这些话就表示这些事：<br />他们要向山和磐石说，倒在我们身上吧！把我们藏起来，躲避坐宝座者的面目和羔羊的忿怒。因为祂忿怒的大日到了，谁能站得住呢？（启示录<a href="http://39-27.cn/启6.16.htm">6:16</a>，<a href="http://39-27.cn/启6.17.htm">17</a>）<br />“山和磐石”（他们向它们说倒在我们身上吧，把我们藏起来）表示邪恶和虚假；“羔羊的忿怒”表示折磨，因为表象是，神性将由于忿怒造成折磨，而事实是，虚假和邪恶本身要对此负责。包含在相关经文（以赛亚书<a href="http://39-27.cn/赛2.10.htm">2:10</a>；何西阿书<a href="http://39-27.cn/何10.8.htm">10:8</a>；路加福音<a href="http://39-27.cn/路23.30.htm">23:30</a>）中的话也具有类似含义。诅咒仅仅因为主的同在就会发生，这一事实也由这歌中接下来的话来表示：<br />你发出烈怒，吞灭他们如同碎秸。因你鼻中的风，水便堆积起来，洪水直立如垒；深渊凝结于海心。你用风一吹，海就把他们淹没；他们寻求深处。你伸出右手，地便吞灭他们。（出埃及记7，8，10，12）<br />具有类似含义的话也出现在圣言的其它许多经文中。</p>

<p align="center"><b>Potts(1905-1910) 8265</b></p><p><b>8265.</b>
The horse and his rider hath He cast into the sea. That this signifies that by His mere presence the falsities from evil were damned and cast into hell, is evident from the signification of a "horse," 
as being falsities from a perverted understanding (that a "horse" denotes the understanding, see n. 2761, 2762, 3217, 5321; and in the opposite sense a perverted understanding, and as this is no understanding, 
in this sense by a "horse" is signified falsity, and by "the horse of Pharaoh," false memory-knowledge, n. 6125, 8146, 8148); from the signification of a "rider" or "horseman," as being the 
consequent reasonings (n. 8146, 8148); and from the signification of "casting into the sea," as being to damn and cast into hell. That "the sea," here the sea Suph, denotes the hell where are the falsities 
from evil of those who being of the church have been in faith separate and in a life of evil, see n. 8099, 8137, 8148; hence it is that they are called falsities "from evil." That these falsities 
were damned and cast into hell by the mere presence of the Lord, was shown in the preceding chapter. For the evil can by no means endure and support the Divine presence, because by the Divine presence 
they are tortured, tormented, and as it were deprived of life, and comport themselves like those who are in the death agony. The reason is that in the Divine there is omnipotence, which destroys 
and extinguishes that which is opposed, thus what is false and evil; consequently the life of those who are in falsity and evil is distressed by the Divine presence, and hence feels hell in itself according 
to the degree of the presence. But lest they who are in falsities and evils should be tortured until they are utterly destroyed, they are veiled over by their falsities and evils as by thick mists, 
which are of such a nature as to mitigate the influx of the Divine, or to repel or to stifle it, as earthly mists or clouds do the rays of the sun. [2] These things are meant by the words in John: </p>
<p> 
    They shall say to the mountains and to the rocks, Fall upon us, and hide us from the face of Him that sitteth on the throne, and from the anger of the Lamb; because the great day of His anger 
is come; who therefore shall be able to stand? (6:16, 17);  by "the mountains and rocks to which they shall say, Fall upon us and hide us" are signified evils and falsities; by "the anger of the Lamb" 
is signified torment, for it appears as if the Divine tormented from anger, when yet it is the falsities and evils themselves. In like manner in Isa. 2:10; and in Hosea 10:8; and in Luke 23:30. That 
damnation is from the mere presence of the Lord, is also signified by what follows in this Song: </p>
<p>     Thou sendest forth Thy wrath, it devoureth them as stubble; and with the wind of Thy nostrils the 
waters were heaped up, the floods stood together like a heap; Thou didst blow with Thy wind, the sea covered them; they sought the deep; Thou stretchedst out Thy right hand, the earth swallowed them 
(verses 7, 8, 10, 12).  In like manner in many other passages in the Word. </p>

<p align="center"><b>Elliott(1983-1999) 8265</b></p><p><b>8265.</b>
'The horse and its rider He has thrown into the sea' means in that as a result simply of His presence falsities arising from evil have been damned and cast into hell. This is clear from the meaning of 
'the horse' as falsities belonging to a perverted understanding, for 'horse' means the power of understanding, see <a href="2761.htm">2761</a>, <a href="2762.htm">2762</a>, <a href="3217.htm">3217</a>, <a href="5321.htm">5321</a>, and in the contrary sense a perverted understanding, which 
is no understanding at all, and therefore falsity is meant in that contrary sense by 'horse' and false factual knowledge by 'Pharaoh's horse', <a href="6125.htm">6125</a>, <a href="8146.htm">8146</a>, <a href="8148.htm">8148</a>; from the meaning of 'rider' (or 'horseman') 
as reasonings based on that false knowledge, dealt with in <a href="8146.htm">8146</a>, <a href="8148.htm">8148</a>; and from the meaning of 'throwing into the sea' as damning and casting into hell. 'The sea', the Sea Suph at this point, is 
the hell where the falsities arising from evil are, the falsities of those belonging to the Church who have upheld separated faith and led a life of evil, see <a href="8099.htm">8099</a>, <a href="8137.htm">8137</a>, <a href="8148.htm">8148</a>, which is why they are called 
falsities arising from evil. The fact that those falsities were damned and cast into hell as a result simply of the Lord's presence was shown in the previous chapter. The evil cannot at all bear 
or put up with God's presence. His presence causes them pain, torments them, and so to speak snuffs the life out of them; they behave like those in the throes of death. The reason for this is that what 
is God's has the totality of power within it; it destroys and wipes out that which is opposed to it, namely falsity and evil. This is why at God's presence the life of those steeped in falsity and 
evil becomes burdensome and contains, in the measure that He is present, the feeling of hell within it. But in order that those steeped in falsities and evils may not be completely crushed and suffer 
torment they are shielded by their own falsities and evils, which act like mists. These are by nature such that they diminish, or divert, or smother the flow of what is Divine in the same way that earthly 
mists or clouds normally do to sunrays. </p>
<p></p>
<p><b>[2]</b>
 These things are meant by the following words in John, </p>
<blockquote>
They will say to the mountains and rocks, Rush down on us and hide us from the face of Him 
who is seated on the throne and from the anger of the Lamb. For the great day of His anger has come; who therefore will be able to stand firm? <a href="http://bible.gospelcom.net/cgi-bin/bible?passage=Rev%206:16,%2017&amp;version=ESV&amp;interface=print&amp;showfn=yes&amp;showxref">Rev 6:16, 17</a>. 
</blockquote>
<p>Evils and falsities are meant by 'the 
mountains and rocks' which they will address, saying that they should rush down on them and hide them. 'The anger of the Lamb' means torment, the appearance being that the Divine would cause the torment 
because of His anger, but the reality being that the falsities and evils themselves are responsible for it. The words contained in <a href="http://bible.gospelcom.net/cgi-bin/bible?passage=Isaiah%202:10&amp;version=ESV&amp;interface=print&amp;showfn=yes&amp;showxref">Isaiah 2:10</a>, <a href="http://bible.gospelcom.net/cgi-bin/bible?passage=Hosea%2010:8&amp;version=ESV&amp;interface=print&amp;showfn=yes&amp;showxref">Hosea 10:8</a>, and <a href="http://bible.gospelcom.net/cgi-bin/bible?passage=Luke%2023:30&amp;version=ESV&amp;interface=print&amp;showfn=yes&amp;showxref">Luke 23:30</a> have a similar meaning. The 
fact that damnation takes place as a result simply of the Lord's presence is also meant by these words that follow in the song, </p>
<p>You send out Your wrath, it eats them up like stubble. And with the 
wind of Your nostrils the waters were heaped up, the floods stood as a heap. You blew with Your wind, the sea covered them over; they sought a deep place. You stretched out Your right hand, the earth 
swallowed them. Verses 7, 8, 10, 12. </p>
<p>Words with a similar meaning occur in very many other places in the Word. </p>

`Equum et equitem projecit in mare': quod significet [in eo] quod ex sola praesentia Ipsius falsa ex malo damnata sint et conjecta in infernum, constat ex significatione `equi' quod sint falsa ex intellectuali 
perverso; quod `equus' sit intellectuale, videatur n. 2761, 2762, 3217, 5321, et in opposito sensu intellectuale perversum, quod quia est nullum intellectuale, significatur in hoc sensu falsum 
per `equum,' et per `equum Pharaonis' scientificum falsum, n. 6125, 8146, 8148; ex significatione `equitis' quod sint ratiocinia inde, de qua n. 8146, 8148; et ex significatione `projicere in mare'

inde est quod dicantur falsa ex malo; quod illa damnata {2}sint et conjecta in infernum ex sola praesentia Domini, in capite praecedente {3} ostensum est; mali enim nullatenus sufferre et sustinere

<p>per `montes et petras' quibus dicent ut `ruerent super illos et absconderent illos' significantur mala
