<h3 align="center" class="ired">属天的奥秘 第5983节</h3>
<h4 align="center"></h4><p><strong>5983.</strong>世人通过两个灵人和两位天使与地狱并天堂交流，这一点从以下事实可以看出来：在来世，一个社群若不通过它所派出的灵人，就无法与另一个社群，或任何人交流。这些特使灵被称为“使臣”，因为各社群通过作为使臣的他们说话。派使臣到其它社群那里，以这种方式获得沟通，是来世的共同特征之一。我通过以下事实十分清楚这一点：使臣们被派到我这里，已有上千次了；没有他们，他们的社群就无从得知关于我的任何事，也无法将关于他们自己的任何事传达给我。由此可见，与世人同在的灵人并魔鬼无非是使臣，世人通过他们与地狱交流；而属天和属灵的天使也是使臣，世人通过他们与天堂交流。</p>

<p align="center"><b>Potts(1905-1910) 5983</b></p><p><b>5983.</b>
That man has communication with hell and with heaven through the two spirits and the two angels, may be seen from the fact that in the other life one society cannot have communication with another, or 
with anyone, except through spirits who are sent forth by the societies. These emissary spirits are called Subjects, for through them as subjects the societies speak. To send forth subjects to other 
societies, and in this way to get communication, is one of the familiar things of the other life, and is very well known to me from the fact that subjects have been sent to me a thousand times, and that 
without them the societies could not know anything appertaining to me, and could communicate to me nothing appertaining to themselves. This shows that the spirits and genii with man are nothing but 
subjects through whom he has communication with hell, and that the celestial and spiritual angels are subjects through whom he has communication with the heavens. </p>

<p align="center"><b>Elliott(1983-1999) 5983</b></p><p><b>5983.</b>
A person's communication with hell and with heaven through two spirits and two angels may be recognized from the consideration that in the next life no one community can have any communication with another 
community or any person except through spirits who are sent out from it. These emissary spirits are called 'subordinates', for communities speak through them as their subordinates. Sending out 
subordinates to other communities with whom they thereby come in contact is one of the common features of the next life. I have been made very aware of it through the fact that such subordinates have 
been sent to me a thousand times over, and that without them their communities could not have known anything at all about me or have communicated anything to me about themselves. From this it may be seen 
that the spirits and genii present with people are nothing else than subordinates through whom they come in contact with hell, while the celestial and spiritual angels are subordinates through whom 
they come in contact with heaven. </p>

</p><b>5983.</b>
Quod per binos spiritus et per binos angelos homini communicatio sit cum inferno et cum caelo, constare potest ex eo quod (t)in altera vita una societas cum alia, aut cum aliquo, non possit communicationem 
habere nisi per spiritus qui ab illis emittuntur; emissarii hi spiritus vocantur `subjecta', nam per illos ut per subjecta loquuntur.  Emittere subjecta ad alias societates et sic communicationem 
{1}sibi comparare, inter familiaria in altera vita est; et mihi notissimum per id quod millies ad me missi fuerint, et quod absque illis nihil scire potuerint quid apud me, ac nihil mecum communicare 
quod apud se. Inde sciri potest quod spiritus et genii {2} apud hominem {3}nihil aliud sint quam subjecta per quae cum inferno communicatio; et quod angeli caelestes et spirituales {4} sint subjecta 
per quae cum caelis communicatio.   @1 habere$ @2 i ab inferno$ @3 non$ @4 i etiam$ </p>
