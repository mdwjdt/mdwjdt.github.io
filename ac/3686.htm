<h3 align="center" class="ired">属天的奥秘 第3686节</h3>
<h4 align="center"></h4><p><strong>3686.</strong>“以扫就看出迦南的女子在他父亲以撒眼中为恶”表主预见并规定，此前与属世良善结合的真理情感不会有助于结合。这从“看出”、“迦南的女子”和“在他父亲以撒眼中为恶”的含义，以及“以扫”的代表清楚可知：“看出”是指预见并规定（参看<a href="2837.htm">2837</a>，<a href="2839.htm">2839</a>节）；“以扫”是指主的属世层的神性良善，如前所述；“迦南的女子”，就是此处赫人的女子，是指对来自非纯正源头的真理的情感（<a href="3470.htm">3470</a>，<a href="3620.htm">3620</a>，<a href="3621.htm">3621</a>，<a href="3622.htm">3622</a>节）；“在他父亲以撒眼中为恶”是指无助于结合，也就是无助于通过“以扫”所代表的属世层良善与“以撒”所代表的理性层良善结合。由此明显可知，这些话表示主预见并规定，对那真理的情感因来自非纯正的源头，故不会有助于结合。此中情形从26章和27章的解读可以看出来，26章（34，35节）论述的主题是以扫娶为妻子的赫人的女子；27章（46节）论述的主题则是雅各被嘱咐不要娶迦南（即赫人）的女子。之所以“迦南的女子”在此表示对来自非纯正源头的真理的情感，而前面“迦南的女子”表示对虚假与邪恶的情感（<a href="3662.htm">3662</a>，<a href="3683.htm">3683</a>节），是因为迦南地的赫人属于外邦人当中的教会，不像那地的其它民族，如 迦南人、亚摩利人、比利洗人那样如此处于虚假与邪恶。这也是为何赫人代表主在外邦人当中的属灵教会（<a href="2913.htm">2913</a>，<a href="2986.htm">2986</a>节）。<br />大洪水前属天的上古教会就位于迦南地（参看<a href="567.htm">567</a>节）；大洪水后的古教会也在那地，此外还在许多其它国家（<a href="1238.htm">1238</a>，<a href="2385.htm">2385</a>节）。那地的所有民族，以及那里所有的地区与河流由此逐渐变成代表。因为属天的上古之人藉着他们所看到的一切物体感知诸如属于主国度的那类事物（<a href="920.htm">920</a>，<a href="1409.htm">1409</a>，<a href="2896.htm">2896</a>，<a href="2897.htm">2897</a>，<a href="2995.htm">2995</a>节），因而也藉着那地的地区与河流去感知。<br />他们的时代过后，这些代表幸存于古教会，包括那里地方的代表。此外，古教会的圣言（<a href="2897.htm">2897</a>-<a href="2899.htm">2899</a>节）也包含地名，这些地名由于同样的原因也是代表；他们的时代之后的圣言，也就是所谓的摩西和先知，也包含它们。这就是为何亚伯拉罕被吩咐到那里去，并向他应许，他的后裔必得着那地。作出这样的应许不是因为他们比其它民族更好，相反，他们是最坏的（<a href="1167.htm">1167</a>，<a href="3373.htm">3373</a>节）。作出这样的应许是为了代表性教会可以通过他们得以建立，在代表性教会中，注意力不要投向那些人或地方本身，而要投向所代表的真实事物（<a href="3670.htm">3670</a>节）；因此，这也是为了上古教会和古教会所用的名字能保存下来。</p>

And Esau saw that the daughters of Canaan were evil in the eyes of Isaac his father. That this signifies the Lord's foresight and providence, that the affections of that truth with which natural good 
had been heretofore conjoined would not conduce to conjunction, is evident from the signification here of "seeing," as being foresight and providence (see n. 2837, 2839); and from the representation 
of Esau, as being the Lord in respect to the Divine good of the natural (concerning which see above); from the signification of the "daughters of Canaan," here the daughters of Heth, as being the affections 
of truth from a ground not genuine (n. 3470, 3620, 3621, 3622); and from the signification of "being evil in the eyes of Isaac his father," as being not to conduce to conjunction, namely, through 
the good of the natural, which is "Esau," with the good of the rational, which is "Isaac." From all this it is evident that by these words is signified the Lord's foresight and providence, that the 
affections of that truth, because not from a genuine ground, would not conduce to conjunction. How the case herein is, may be seen from the explication at chapter 26, verses 34, 35, where the daughters 
of Heth are treated of whom Esau had taken to himself for women; and at chapter 27, verse 46, where it is said of Jacob that he should not take to himself a woman of the daughters of Canaan [Heth]. 
That by the "daughters of Canaan" are here signified the affections of truth from a ground not genuine, and above by the "daughters of Canaan," the affections of falsity and evil (n. 3662, 3683), is 
because the Hittites were of the Church of the Gentiles in the land of Canaan, and were not so much in falsity and evil as were the other nations there-the Canaanites, Amorites, and Perizzites. Hence 
also by the Hittites there was represented the Lord's spiritual church among the Gentiles (n. 2913, 2986).  [2] That the Most Ancient Church, which was celestial and existed before the flood, was in 
the land of Canaan, may be seen above (n. 567); and that the Ancient Church, which was after the flood, was also in that land, and moreover in a number of other kingdoms, see above (n. 1238, 2385). From 
this it came to pass that all the nations in that land, and likewise all the regions and all the rivers thereof, became representative; for the most ancient people, who were celestial men, by means 
of all the objects which they saw, perceived such things as are of the Lord's kingdom (n. 920, 1409, 2896, 2897, 2995); thus also by means of the regions and rivers of that land. After their times these 
representatives remained in the Ancient Church, thus also the representatives of the places in that land. The Word in the Ancient Church (n. 2897-2899), also had thence the names of places representative, 
as had also the Word after their time which is called "Moses and the Prophets;" and because this was so, Abraham was commanded to go thither, and a promise was made him that his posterity should 
possess that land; and this not because of their being better than other nations, for they were among the worst of all (n. 1167, 3373), but in order that by them a representative church might be instituted, 
in which no attention should be paid to person or to place, but to the things that were represented (n. 3670); and that thereby also the names used in the Most Ancient and the Ancient Church 
might be retained. </p>

'And Esau saw that the daughters of Canaan were evil in the eyes of Isaac his father' means the Lord's foresight and provision that the affections for that truth - the affections to which natural good 
had been joined until then - would not be suitable for such conjunction. This is clear from the meaning of 'seeing' here as foresight and provision, dealt with in <a href="2837.htm">2837</a>, <a href="2839.htm">2839</a>; from the representation 
of 'Esau' as the Lord as regards the Divine Good of the Natural, dealt with already; from the meaning of 'the daughters of Canaan', in this case the daughters of Heth, as affections for truth from a 
non-genuine source, dealt with in <a href="3470.htm">3470</a>, <a href="3620.htm">3620</a>-<a href="3622.htm">3622</a>; and from the meaning of '[evil] in the eyes of Isaac his father' as not being suitable for such conjunction, that is to say, through the good of the 
natural, represented by 'Esau', with the good of the rational, represented by 'Isaac'. From this it is evident that all these words mean the Lord's foresight and provision that the affections for that 
truth, being from a non-genuine source, would not be suitable for conjunction. The truth of all this may be seen from the explanation given <a href="http://bible.gospelcom.net/cgi-bin/bible?passage=at%2026:34,35&amp;version=ESV&amp;interface=print&amp;showfn=yes&amp;showxref">at 26:34,35</a>, where the subject is the daughters of Heth whom 
Esau had taken as wives, and <a href="http://bible.gospelcom.net/cgi-bin/bible?passage=at%2027:46&amp;version=ESV&amp;interface=print&amp;showfn=yes&amp;showxref">at 27:46</a>, where the subject is the plea to Jacob not to marry one of the daughters of Canaan. The reason why 'the daughters of Canaan' here means affections for truth from 
a non-genuine source, whereas above 'the daughters of Canaan' meant affections for falsity and evil, <a href="3662.htm">3662</a>, <a href="3683.htm">3683</a>, is that the Hittites in the land of Canaan belonged to the Church as it existed among 
gentiles. They were not so much under the influence of falsity and evil as other nations there, such as the Canaanites, Amorites, and Perizzites. This also was why the Hittites represented the Lord's 
spiritual Church among the gentiles, <a href="2913.htm">2913</a>, <a href="2986.htm">2986</a>. </p>
<p></p>
<p><b>[2]</b>
 The Most Ancient Church which was celestial and existed before the Flood was situated in the land of Canaan, see <a href="567.htm">567</a>. The Ancient Church which 
existed after the Flood was also situated there, as well as in many other countries, <a href="1238.htm">1238</a>, <a href="2385.htm">2385</a>. This was how it came about that all the gentile nations there, and also all the territories there, and 
all the rivers there, served as representatives. For the most ancient people, who were celestial, perceived through all the objects they beheld the kind of things that belong to the Lord's kingdom, <a href="920.htm">920</a>, <a href="1409.htm">1409</a>, <a href="2896.htm">2896</a>, <a href="2897.htm">2897</a>, <a href="2995.htm">2995</a>, and so beheld the same through the territories and the rivers there. </p>
<p></p>
<p><b>[3]</b>
 After their times those representatives survived in the Ancient Church, including the representatives 
related to the places there. Furthermore the Word that existed in the Ancient Church, dealt with in <a href="2897.htm">2897</a>-<a href="2899.htm">2899</a>, contained place-names which were for the same reason representative; and the Word existing 
after their times, which is called Moses and the Prophets, also contains them. This was why Abraham was commanded to go there, and the promise was made to him that his descendants would possess 
that land. That promise was not made because they were any better than all the other nations, for they were the worst of them all, <a href="1167.htm">1167</a>, <a href="3373.htm">3373</a>. But it was made so that through them the representative 
Church might be established, in which no attention was paid to representative persons and places themselves but to the actual things which these represented, <a href="3670.htm">3670</a>, and thus also so that the names existing 
in the Most Ancient and the Ancient Churches might be preserved. </p>

`Et vidit Esau, quod malae filiae Canaan in oculis Jischaki patris sui':  quod significet praevidentiam et providentiam Domini quod affectiones veri illius cum quibus bonum naturale hactenus conjunctum 
esset, non conducerent ad conjunctionem, {1}constat a significatione `videre' hic quod sit praevidentia et providentia, de qua n. 2837, 2839; ex repraesentatione `Esavi' quod sit Dominus quoad Divinum 
Bonum Naturalis, de qua prius; ex significatione `filiarum Canaanis,' hic filiarum Heth, quod sint affectiones veri ex non genuino, de qua n. 3470, 3620-3622; et ex significatione `[malae] in oculis 
Jischaki patris sui' quod sit non conducere ad conjunctionem, nempe per naturalis bonum quod {2}Esau, cum rationalis bono quod {3}`Jischak'; inde patet quod per illa verba significetur praevidentia 
et providentia Domini quod affectiones veri illius, quia non ex genuino, non conducerent ad conjunctionem:  haec quomodo se habent, constare potest ab explicatione ad cap. xxvi vers. 34, 35, ubi agitur 
de filiabus Heth quas Esau sibi acceperat mulieres; et ad cap. xxvii vers. 46, ubi agitur de Jacobo quod `non ex filiabus Canaan sumeret sibi mulierem':  quod per `filias Canaan' hic significentur 
affectiones veri ex non genuino, et supra per `filias Canaan' affectiones falsi et mali, n. 3662, 3683, inde est quia Hittaei fuerunt in terra Canaane ab Ecclesia gentium, non ita in falso et malo 
sicut gentes aliae ibi, ut Canaanaei, Emoraei et Perizzaei; inde etiam per Hittaeos repraesentata est Ecclesia spiritualis Domini apud gentes, n. 2913, 2986. [2] Quod Antiquissima Ecclesia quae caelestis 
et ante diluvium, fuerit in terra Canaane, videatur n. 567; et quod Ecclesia Antiqua, quae post diluvium, {4}etiam ibi, praeter in pluribus aliis regnis, n. 1238, 2385; inde ortum, quod omnes gentes 
ibi, et quoque omnes terrae ibi, et omnes fluvii ibi, induerint repraesentativa; nam antiquissimi qui caelestes homines fuerunt, per omnia objecta quae videbant, perceperunt talia quae sunt regni Domini, 
n. 920, 1409, 2896, 2897, 2995, ita quoque per terras et fluvios ibi; [3] illa repraesentativa post illorum tempora permanserunt in Ecclesia Antiqua, ita quoque repraesentativa locorum ibi; Verbum 
in Antiqua Ecclesia, de quo n. 2897-2899, etiam nomina locorum repraesentativa inde habuit, sicut etiam Verbum post illorum tempus, quod Moses et Prophetae vocatur; et quia ita erat, Abraham jussus 
est ut illuc iret, et ei promissio facta, {5}ut posteri ejus possiderent illam terram, et hoc non ideo quia reliquis gentibus meliores {6}erant, erant enim inter omnium pessimos, n. 1167, 3373, sed
