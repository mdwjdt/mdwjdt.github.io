<h3 align="center" class="ired">属天的奥秘 第1274节</h3>
<h4 align="center"></h4><p><strong>1274.</strong>来世存在的奇妙现象如下：<br />①就位置而言，灵人和天使的社群看上去截然不同，彼此分开，即便来世的地方和距离无非是各种各样的状态。<br />②位置和距离是相对人体而言的，所以在右方的人总是出现在右方，无论身体转向哪个方向。在左方或任何其它方向的人也是这样。<br />③没有哪些灵人和天使会遥远到无法被看到，然而进入视野的不会多过主所允许的。<br />④主若允许，其他人所思想的灵人（如他们在肉身生活时以某种方式所认识的人）会瞬间出现。他们会接近到彼此听见、触摸的程度，或多多少少有点距离，尽管他们可能相距数千英里，甚至在不同的星球之间。原因在于，在来世，空间距离毫无影响。<br />⑤天使没有任何时间概念，灵人界也一样，但在天堂更彻底。那么主的情况又会是什么样呢？所有人，无论总体还是个体，必然与祂密切同在，呈现在祂的视野和圣治之下。<br />这些事听上去难以置信，然而却是千真万确的。</p>

<p><strong>[NCE]1274.</strong> Among the marvels of the next life are the following:<br />1. Communities of spirits and angels seem to occupy different positions, even though locations and distances in the other world are simply differences in state.<br />2. Location and distance relate to the human body in such a way that people on our right appear to the right no matter which way we turn our body. The same holds true for those on our left and in other directions too.<br />3. No spirit or angel is too far away to be seen, and yet no more of them come into sight than the Lord allows.<br />4. The spirits we are thinking about — people we knew in some way during bodily life, for instance — show up instantly, when the Lord allows it. They are so close that they stand at our ear, in arm's reach, or at a little distance. Although they may have been several thousand miles away, or even up among the stars, it is no obstacle, because the distance of a place does not matter at all in the other life.<br />5. Angels have no concept of time.<br />These wonders occur in the world of spirits, and they occur in a still more perfect way in heaven. Imagine, then, how the Lord sees it! After all, not a single one of us can help being directly present to him, right under his gaze and providence.<br />These things seem unbelievable and yet are true. </p>

Among the marvelous things in the other life are, - First, the fact that societies of spirits and angels appear distinct from one another as to situation, although places and distances in that life are 
nothing else than varieties of state. Second, that the situations and distances are determined by their relation to the human body, so that those who are on the right appear on the right whichever 
way the body is turned; and the case is the same with those who are on the left and in all other directions. Third, that no spirits or angels are at so great a distance away that they cannot be seen; 
and yet no more come into view than so many as the Lord permits. Fourth, that spirits of whom others are thinking-for example, such as had been in some manner known to them in the life of the body-when 
the Lord permits it, are present in a moment, and so closely that they are at the ear, in touch, or else at some distance, greater or less, no matter should they be thousands of miles away, or even 
among the stars. The reason is that distance of place has no effect in the other life. Fifth, that with the angels there is no idea of time. These things are so in the world of spirits, and are still 
more completely so in heaven. How much more then must this be the case before the Lord, to whom all both generally and individually cannot but be most present, and under His view and providence. These 
things seem incredible, but yet they are true. </p>

The marvels existing in the next life include the following: </p>
<p> <a href="1.htm">1</a> Communities of spirits and of angels, as regards position, appear distinct and separate from one another, even though places and distances 
in the next life are nothing other than varieties of state. </p>
<p><a href="2.htm">2</a> Position and distances are relative to the human body, so that people on the right thus seem to be stationed on the right whichever 
way the body turns. The same applies to those on the left, or in any other direction. </p>
<p><a href="3.htm">3</a> No spirits and angels are so far away that they cannot be seen; yet no more come into view than the Lord allows 
to do so. </p>
<p><a href="4.htm">4</a> When the Lord allows it, spirits whom others are thinking about - for example, people who had been known to them in some way during their lifetime - are present in an instant. They 
come close enough to be heard or touched, or stand a little way off, notwithstanding the fact that they may have been several thousands of miles away, even up among the stars. The reason is that spatial 
distance is meaningless in the next life. </p>
<p><a href="5.htm">5</a> With angels no idea of time exists; it is the same in the world of spirits, but more completely so in heaven. What then must the situation be with the 
Lord, to whom every single human being is inescapably most fully present and beneath His view and Providence? </p>
<p>These things seem unbelievable but are nevertheless true. </p>

</p><b>1274.</b>
Inter mirabilia in altera vita sunt: PRIMUM, quod spirituum et angelorum societates appareant inter se distinctae quoad situs, tametsi loca et distantiae in altera vita nihil aliud sint quam status 
varietates; ALTERUM est quod situs et distantiae se habeant respective ad corpus humanum, ita ut qui ad dextram, appareant ad dextram, quocumque circumvertitur corpus, similiter qui ad sinistram, tum 
qui ad alias plagas; TERTIUM est quod omnes spiritus et angeli non ad majorem distantiam absint quam ut conspici queant; sed usque tamen non plures in conspectum veniunt quam quot Dominus concedit; QUARTUM, 
quod spiritus de quibus alii cogitant, ut qui iis aliquo modo noti fuerunt in vita corporis, quando Dominus id concedit, momento adsint; ac ita proxime ut sint ad aurem, ad contactum, vel ad aliquam 
distantiam, non obstante quod fuissent abinde aliquot millia milliarium, immo si fuissent circa astra; causa est quia distantia loci in altera vita nihil facit; QUINTUM est quod apud angelos nulla 
idea temporis sit; haec in mundo spirituum, adhuc perfectius in caelo; quid non coram Domino, Cui omnes et singuli non possunt non praesentissimi esse et sub Ipsius conspectu et Providentia. Haec apparent 
incredibilia, sed usque sunt vera. </p>
