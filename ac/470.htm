<h3 align="center" class="ired">属天的奥秘 第470节</h3>
<h4 align="center"></h4><p><strong>470.</strong>“族谱”记录了属上古教会之人。这一点从下面的经文显而易见，因为从这里直到11章的希伯，所提及的名字无一表示人，皆表实在的事物。上古时期，人类分为家、族、国。丈夫和妻子及其孩子，连同他们的家仆组成一个家庭。数个这样或大或小的家庭组成一个家族，他们毗邻而居，但不住在一起。而数个或大或小的家族又组成一个国家。</p>

<p><strong>[NCE]470.</strong> What follows establishes clearly enough that the book of births is the enumeration of those who were part of the earliest church. From here up to chapter <a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_470/bible_king-james-version_genesis_11_1-32" target=_top>11</a>, or to Eber, names never refer to individuals but to some development.<br />In the earliest era, the human race was divided up into households, clans, and nations. A household comprised a husband and wife and their children along with others of the same clan who served them. A clan comprised several households (the number could be small or large) living not far from each other but not in exactly the same place either. A nation comprised a small or large number of clans. </p>
<p align="center"><b>Potts(1905-1910) 470</b></p><p><b>470.</b>
That the "book of the births" is an enumeration of those who were of the Most Ancient Church, is very evident from what follows, for from this to the eleventh chapter, that is, to the time of Eber, names 
never signify persons, but actual things. In the most ancient time mankind were distinguished into houses, families, and nations; a house consisting of the husband and wife with their children, together 
with some of their family who served; a family, of a greater or lesser number of houses, that lived not far apart and yet not together; and a nation, of a larger or smaller number of families. </p>

<p align="center"><b>Elliott(1983-1999) 470</b></p><p><b>470.</b>
'The book of the generations' is a record of those who belonged to the Most Ancient Church. This is quite clear from what follows, for from here down to Eber in Chapter <a href="11.htm">11</a> the names used nowhere mean 
actual persons but real things. In most ancient times the human race was divided into houses, families, and nations. A house consisted of husband and wife together with their children, and also other 
members of their family who were the servants. A family consisted of a number of such houses, many or few, who dwell in close proximity to one another, but not together. A nation consisted of a number 
of families, many or few.  </p>

</p><b>470.</b>
Quod 'liber nativitatum' sit recensio eorum qui fuerunt ab Ecclesia Antiquissima, a sequentibus satis constat; nam nomina nusquam hic usque ad cap. xi seu ad Eberum, significant personas sed res.  Antiquissimo 
tempore distinctum fuit humanum genus in domos, familias, et gentes; 'domum' constituit maritus et uxor cum liberis eorum, tum etiam aliqui ex familia eorum qui serviebant: 'familiam' constituerunt 
domus pauciores aut plures quarum una non procul ab altera habitavit, sed usque non una: 'gentem' constituerunt familiae pauciores aut plures. </p>
