<h3 align="center" class="ired">属天的奥秘 第5621节</h3>
<h4 align="center"></h4><p><strong>5621.</strong>“蜡，没药”表内层属世层的良善之真理。这从“蜡”和“没药”的含义清楚可知：“蜡”，即此处的香蜡，是指良善之真理，如下文所述；“没药”也是指源于良善的真理（参看<a href="4748.htm">4748</a>节）。之所以表示内层属世层的良善之真理，是因为这些香料比乳香和蜂蜜更纯粹，因此其次被提及。事实上，在圣言中，这类物质是照着次序被列举的。但此处所说的“蜡”不是指普通的蜡，而是指香蜡，如苏合香。原文中所用的词就表示这种蜡，这个词也表示香料。由此可见为何这种香蜡表示良善之真理；因为所有香料闻起来都很香甜，故在内义上表示源于良善的真理。<br />这一点从以下事实可以看出来：在天上，源于良善的真理和世上的香物一样感觉令人愉快。而且当天使的感知转化为气味时（主若乐意，这种事经常发生），它们闻起来就像香料和鲜花发出的芳香。这就是为何乳香和香由芳香物质复合而成，发挥神圣的功用；这也是为何芳香物质会与膏油调和在一起。人若不知道这些做法背后的原因就在于天上的人所感知到的事物，就会以为这些做法被吩咐，纯粹是为了使外在敬拜蒙悦纳；但在这种情况下，它们里面丝毫没有天堂之物，或神圣之物，因而这类宗教习俗没有任何神性事物在里面。关于这些事，可参看前面的说明：乳香和香，以及用于膏油的芳香物质是属灵和属天事物的代表（<a href="4748.htm">4748</a>节）；信与爱的气场会转化为怡人的气味，因而是怡人的香甜气息；而且香味表示源于爱之良善的信之真理（<a href="1514.htm">1514</a>，<a href="1517.htm">1517</a>-<a href="1519.htm">1519</a>，<a href="4628.htm">4628</a>节）。</p>

Wax and stacte. That this signifies the truths of good of the interior natural, is evident from the signification of "wax," here aromatic wax, as being the truth of good (of which in what follows); and 
from the signification of "stacte," as also being truth from good (see n. 4748). Their being of the interior natural is because these spices are purer than resin and honey, and are therefore mentioned 
in the second place; for such particulars are enumerated in the Word in accordance with the order. By "wax" here is not meant common, but aromatic wax, such as storax. This wax is signified by the 
term used in the original language, and spice also by the same. Hence it is plain why this aromatic wax signifies the truth of good; for all spices, being sweet-scented, in the internal sense signify 
the truths which are from good. This may be seen from the fact that truths from good are perceived in heaven pleasantly, like sweet-scented things in the world; and therefore when the perceptions of 
the angels are turned into odors, as of the Lord's good pleasure often happens, they are then smelt as fragrances from spices and from flowers. This is the reason why frankincense and incense were compounded 
of materials of grateful odor, and were employed for a holy use; and also why aromatics were mixed with the anointing oil. One who does not know that such things derive their cause from things 
perceived in heaven, may be of the opinion that they were commanded merely to render outward worship grateful; but in that case there would be in them nothing of heaven, or nothing holy, and consequently 
such matters of worship would not have anything Divine in them. (See what has already been shown on this subject; that frankincense and incense, and also the fragrant substances used in the anointing 
oil, were representative of spiritual and celestial things, n. 4748; and that the spheres of faith and love are turned into grateful odors, and therefore grateful and sweet-scented and also spicy 
odors signify truths of faith which are from the good of love, n. 1514, 1517-1519, 4628.) </p>

'Wax and stacte' means the truths of interior natural good. This is clear from the meaning of 'wax', in this case aromatic wax, as the truth of good, dealt with below; and from the meaning of 'stacte' 
too as truth derived from good, dealt with in <a href="4748.htm">4748</a>. The truths of interior natural good are meant because these spices are purer substances than resin or honey, and for that reason the mention of them 
comes second. For in the Word order determines the way in which such substances are listed. 'Wax' is not used here to mean ordinary wax but an aromatic kind, such as storax. This kind of wax is what 
the word in the original language is used to describe; and the same word is used for spice. From this one may see why this aromatic wax means the truth of good; for all spices, because they are sweet 
smelling, mean in the internal sense truths that are derived from good. </p>
<p></p>
<p><b>[2]</b>
 This may be recognized from the consideration that in heaven truths derived from good are perceived with the same pleasure 
as sweet scents in the world. Also, when angels' perceptions are converted into odours, which in the Lord's good pleasure happens frequently, they are therefore detected as fragrances coming from 
spices and from flowers. This is why frankincense and incense were prepared from odiferous substances and put to a sacred use, and also why aromatic substances were mixed with oil for anointing. Anyone 
who does not know that the cause behind those practices lay among the perceptions enjoyed by those in heaven may suppose that they were practices enjoined solely to make external worship pleasant and 
that they held nothing of heaven and nothing holy at all within them, consequently that such religious practices held nothing Divine within them. See what has been shown already on these matters: </p>
<p> Frankincense 
and incense, as well as the fragrant substances in oil for anointing, were representative of spiritual and celestial things, <a href="4748.htm">4748</a>. </p>
<p>Spheres of faith and love are converted into pleasant 
odours; and therefore pleasant and sweet-smelling odours, also aromatic ones, mean the truths of faith which are derived from the good of love, <a href="1514.htm">1514</a>, <a href="1517.htm">1517</a>-<a href="1519.htm">1519</a>, <a href="4618.htm">4618</a>. </p>

`Ceram et stacten':  quod significet vera boni naturalis interioris, constat ex significatione `cerae' hic cerae aromaticae, quod sit verum boni, de qua sequitur; et ex significatione `stactes' quod 
quoque sit verum ex bono, de qua n. 4748; quod sint naturalis interioris, est quia aromata illa puriora sunt quam resina et mel, et ideo secundo loco nominantur, talia enim in Verbo recensentur secundum 
ordinem. Per `ceram' ibi non intelligitur cera vulgaris sed cera aromatica, quae sicut storax; haec cera per vocem qua exprimitur in lingua originali, significatur, etiam per eandem aroma; inde patet 
cur cera illa aromatica significat verum boni; omnia enim aromata quia suaveolentia, in sensu interno significant vera quae ex bono; {1}hoc constare potest ex eo quod vera quae ex bono in caelo percipiantur 
ita amoene, sicut suaveolentia in mundo; quapropter etiam cum perceptiones angelorum vertuntur in odores, quod saepe fit ex beneplacito Domini, tunc sicut fragrantiae ex aromatibus et ex floribus 
sentiuntur; inde est quod tura et suffimenta ex grate odoratis confecta fuerint et in usum sanctum adhibita, et inde quoque est quod aromatica immixta fuerint oleo unctionis; qui nescit quod talia 
trahant causam ex perceptivis in caelo, {2}opinari potest quod solum mandata fuerint ut gratum redderent cultum externum, sed tunc nihil de caelo, seu nihil sancti inesset, consequenter {3}talia cultus 
in se non Divinum haberent.  Videantur quae prius de his ostensa sunt, nempe quod tura et suffimenta, tum fragrantia in oleo unctionis, fuerint repraesentativa spiritualium et caelestium, n. 4748; 
quod sphaerae fidei et amoris vertantur in odores gratos, et quod inde odores grati et suaveolentes, tum aromatici, significent vera fidei quae ex bono amoris, n. 1514, 1517-1519,4628. </p>
