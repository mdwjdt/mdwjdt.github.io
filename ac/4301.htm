<h3 align="center" class="ired">属天的奥秘 第4301节</h3>
<h4 align="center"></h4><p><strong>4301.</strong>“雅各经过毗努伊勒”表良善里面的真理的状态。这从“毗努伊勒”的含义清楚可知，“毗努伊勒”是指良善里面的真理的状态。因为雅致在进入迦南地时，首先过的是雅博渡口，而雅博渡口表示对真理的情感的第一次注入（参看<a href="4270.htm">4270</a>，<a href="4271.htm">4271</a>节）。而现在他所要经过的是毗努伊勒，故“毗努伊勒”表示已经注入良善的真理的状态。所论述的主题也是这种良善与那种良善的结合；不过，良善若没有真理在里面，就不是良善；因为良善从真理获得其特定性质和形式，以致人里面的良善若没有真理在里面，就不能被称为良善。而真理则从良善获得其本质，因而获得其生命。由于事实的确如此，并且所论述的主题是这种良善与那种良善的结合，故所论述的主题也是良善里面的真理的状态。<br />至于良善里面的真理的状态，诚然，这种状态能被描述出来，但除了那些拥有属天觉察的人外，没有人能理解它。没有这种觉察的人甚至对真理与良善的结合没有任何概念；因为对他们来说，真理陷入模糊。事实上，他们将从教义所学来的称为真理，将照这真理所行的称为良善；而那些拥有觉察的人则拥有居于天堂之光的理解或思想视觉，并以与良善结合的真理为乐，犹如肉眼或肉体视觉以花园中盛开的鲜花和春天的草地为乐。那些拥有内在觉察的人以这些真理为乐，如同以它们所散发的怡人芳香为乐。这就是天使的状态，因此这类天使能觉察出伴随着真理注入良善并与它们结合的一切不同和变化，进而觉察出无穷事物，远远胜过世人；因为世人甚至不知道竟然还有什么注入和结合，并且人就是以这种方式而变得属灵。<br />为了传达对这个问题的某种概念，有必要就此作以简要说明。有两样事物构成内在人，即理解或认知和意愿。真理属于理解或认知，良善属于意愿；因为人将自己所知道并理解为正确的称为真理；将自己出于意愿所行的、因而将自己所意愿的称为良善。这两种官能必须构成一体。这一点可通过对比肉眼的视觉和以视觉所体验到的愉悦、快乐来说明。当肉眼看见物体时，它就会照着它们的形态、色彩，以及这些所带给物体的优美（无论总体还是部分）而体验到一种愉悦和快乐；简言之，它以这些里面的次序或模式为乐。这种愉悦和快乐并不属于眼睛，而是属于心智及其情感。人越对它们拥有某种情感，就越会注视它们，并将其留在记忆中。而眼睛虽然看见、却没有情感的事物则会忽略过去，不会植入记忆，因而不会变成记忆的一部分。<br />由此明显可知，外在视觉的物体会照着情感的愉悦和快乐而被植入；并且它们就处于这种愉悦和快乐；因为当有类似愉悦或快乐重现时，这类物体也重现；同样，当类似物体重现时，这种愉悦和快乐也会重现，并且照着状态而具有多样性。理解或认知，也就是内视也一样；它的物体是属灵的，被称为真理；这些物体的田地就是记忆；这种视觉的愉悦和快乐就是良善；因而良善就是那真理被播种并植入其中的。由此可对何为真理注入良善和它们一个在另一个里面的结合获得某种概念；以及对此处所论述的良善是什么获得某种概念，对于这种良善，天使能觉察出无数事物，而人几乎什么也觉察不出来。</p>

As he passed over Penuel. That this signifies the state of truth in good, is evident from the signification of "Penuel," as being the state of truth in good. For Jabbok was the stream first passed over 
by Jacob when he entered into the land of Canaan, and by this is signified the first instilling of the affections of truth, see n. 4270, 4271. It is the Penuel that he now passes over, and therefore 
by it is signified a state of truth that is insinuated into good. The conjunction of good is also treated of, and good is not good unless there is truth in it; for good has its quality and also its 
form from truth, insomuch that good cannot be called good in any man unless there is truth in it; but truth receives its essence, and consequently its life, from good; and this being the case, and the 
subject treated of being the conjunction of goods, the state of truth in good is also treated of.  [2] As regards the state of truth in good, this can indeed be described, but yet it cannot be apprehended, 
except by those who have celestial perception. Others cannot even have an idea of the conjunction of truth with good, because with them truth is in obscurity; for they call that truth which they 
have learned from doctrinal things, and that good which is done according to this truth; whereas they who have perception are in celestial light as to their understanding (that is, as to their intellectual 
sight), and they are affected with truths which are conjoined with good, as the eye or bodily sight is affected with flowers in gardens and meadows in the time of spring; and they who are in 
interior perception are affected with these truths as with a fragrance that is exhaled from them. Such is the angelic state, and therefore such angels perceive all the differences and all the varieties 
of the instilling and conjunction of truth in good, and thus endless things more than man; for man does not even know that there is any instilling and conjunction, and that a man becomes spiritual thereby. 
 [3] A few words shall be added in order to convey some notion of this matter. There are two things which constitute the internal man-the understanding and the will. To the understanding pertain 
truths, and to the will goods; for what a man knows and understands to be so, he calls truth; and what he does from will, thus what he wills, he calls good. These two faculties should constitute a 
one. This may be illustrated by comparison with the sight of the eye, and with the pleasantness and delight that are experienced by means of this sight. When the eye sees objects, it experiences a pleasantness 
and delight from them in accordance with their forms, colors, and their consequent beauties both in general and in their parts; in a word, in accordance with the order or dispositions into 
series. This pleasantness and delight are not of the eye, but of the animus and its affection; and insofar as the man is affected with them, so far he sees them and retains them in memory, while the things 
that the eye sees from no affection, are passed over and are not implanted in the memory, thus are not conjoined with it.  [4] From this it is evident that the objects of the external sight are 
implanted in accordance with the pleasantness and delight of the affections; and that they are in this pleasantness and delight; for when a similar pleasantness or delight recurs, such objects also recur; 
and in like manner when similar objects recur, such pleasantness and delight also recur, with variety according to the states. It is the same with the understanding, which is the internal sight 
- its objects are spiritual, and are called truths; the field of these objects is the memory; the pleasantness and delight of this sight is good; and thus good is that in which truths are inseminated 
and implanted. From this it may in some measure appear what the instilling of truth into good is, and what the conjunction of truth in good; also, what the good is which is here treated of, and in regard 
to which angels perceive things so innumerable, while man perceives scarcely anything. </p>

<p align="center"><b>Elliott(1983-1999) 4301</b></p><p><b>4301.</b>
'As he passed over Penuel' means a state of truth within good. This is clear from the meaning of 'Penuel' as a state of truth within good. It was the Jabbok that Jacob passed over first when he entered 
the land of Canaan, by which the first instillation of the affections for truth is meant, see <a href="4270.htm">4270</a>, <a href="4271.htm">4271</a>, whereas it is Penuel which he passes over now. Hence 'Penuel' means a state of truth that has 
been instilled into good. The subject is also the joining of the one kind of good to the other; but good is not good unless it has truth within it, for good derives its specific nature as well as its 
form from truth' so much so that good cannot with anyone be called good unless truth is present within it. But truth acquires its essence and consequently its life from good. This being so and the 
joining of the one kind of good to the other being the subject, the state of truth within good is dealt with too. </p>
<p></p>
<p><b>[2]</b>
 As for the state of truth within good, this can indeed be described but no one 
can grasp what it is except those who have celestial perception. People who do not have this perception cannot even have any concept of the joining of truth to good, since for them truth lies in obscurity. 
Indeed they call the truth that which they have learned from matters of doctrine, and they call good that which is done in accordance with that truth. But those who do have perception have an understanding 
or mental sight that dwells in heavenly light, and they take delight in truths which are joined to good, just as the eye or physical sight takes delight in flowers growing in gardens and meadows 
in springtime. And people who have interior perception take delight so to speak in the lovely scent coming from them. Such is the angelic state, and therefore those angels perceive all the differences 
and all the variations that go with the instillation of truth into good and the joining together of them one within the other. So they perceive immeasurably more than man does, for man does not 
even know of any such instillation and joining together and that it is in this way that man becomes spiritual. </p>
<p></p>
<p><b>[3]</b>
 But so that people may have some concept of this matter a brief statement must be 
made about it. There are two things which constitute the internal man - understanding and will. To the understanding truths belong and to the will goods, for that which a person knows and understands 
to be true he calls the truth, and that which he does from the will, and so that which he wills, he calls good. These two abilities must constitute a single unit. This may be illustrated by comparison 
with the sight of the eye and with the pleasure and delight which is experienced through the use of this sight. When the eye beholds objects it takes pleasure and delight in their form and colour and 
the resulting beauty which these bring to the objects as a whole and to the individual parts; in short it takes delight in the order or patterns in these. That pleasure and delight does not belong 
to the eye but to the mind (animus) and its affection. And insofar as a person has any affection for them he beholds them and retains them in his memory. But things which the eye beholds without any affection 
for them slip away and are not sown in the memory and so made part of it. </p>
<p></p>
<p><b>[4]</b>
 From this it is evident that the objects of external sight are implanted insofar as there exists the pleasure 
and delight that go with affections for them, and that those objects are present in that pleasure and delight. For whenever much the same pleasure or delight occurs such objects return with them; and 
likewise whenever much the same objects are seen again such pleasure and delight returns with them, though with variations that depend on the states involved. A similar situation exists with the understanding, 
which is internal sight. The objects of that sight am spiritual and are called truths, for the field in which those objects are active is the memory, and the pleasure and delight associated 
with that sight is good. So it is good in which truths are sown and implanted. From this one may gain some idea of what the instillation of truth into good is and the joining together of them one within 
the other, also some idea of what that good is which is the subject here, a kind of good about which angels perceive countless things, whereas man perceives scarcely anything. </p>

`sicut transivit Penuel':  quod significet statum veri in bono, constat ex significatione `Penuel' quod sit status veri in bono; Jabbok enim erat quem Jacob primum transivit cum ingressus est in 
terram Canaanem, per quem quod significetur insinuatio prima affectionum veri, videatur {1} n. 4270, (o)4271; Penuel est quem nunc transit; inde est quod per illum significetur status veri insinuati 
in bono; agitur etiam de conjunctione boni, et bonum non est bonum nisi in illo sit verum, nam bonum suum quale et quoque suam formam habet a vero, usque adeo ut bonum non appellari queat bonum apud 
ullum hominem nisi ei insit verum, sed verum suam essentiam et consequenter suam vitam accipit a bono; et quia ita est et de conjunctione bonorum agitur, etiam de statu veri in bono agitur.  [2] 
Quod statum veri in bono attinet, ille quidem describi potest, sed usque non capi quam ab illis qui perceptionem caelestem habent; [qui hanc non habent] ne quidem ideam conjunctionis veri cum bono 
habere possunt, est enim verum illis in obscuro; id enim verum dicunt quod a doctrinalibus didicerunt, et id bonum quod fit secundum id verum; at qui perceptionem habent, ii in luce caelesti sunt 
quoad intellectum seu quoad visum intellectualem, et afficiuntur veris quae conjunguntur bono, sicut oculus seu visus corporeus afficitur floribus in hortis et pratis tempore veris; et qui in interiore 
perceptione sunt, afficiuntur illis etiam sicut fragrantia ex illis exhalata; talis est status angelicus, quapropter percipiunt illi angeli omnia discrimina et omnes varietates insinuationis 
et conjunctionis veri in bono, ita indefinita prae homine, nam homo ne quidem scit quod aliqua insinuatio et conjunctio sit et quod inde homo fiat spiritualis; </p>
<p>[3] ut vero aliqua notio hujus rei habeatur, 
paucis dicendum: bina sunt quae internum hominem constituunt, nempe intellectus et voluntas; ad intellectum pertinent vera et ad voluntatem bona, nam quod scit et intelligit homo quod ita sit, 
hoc dicit verum, et {2} quod agit ex velle, ita quod vult, hoc dicit bonum; hae binae facultates unum constituent {3}: illustrari hoc potest per comparationem cum visu oculi, et cum amoeno et jucundo 
{4} quod per visum hunc appercipitur; oculus cum videt objecta, appercipit amoenum et jucundum inde secundum formas, colores, et inde pulchritudines in communi et in partibus, verbo secundum 
ordinem aut dispositiones in series; illud amoenum et jucundum non est oculi, sed est animi et ejus affectionis; et quantum homo afficitur illis, tantum illa videt, et tantum illa memoria retinet; 
quae autem {5} oculus ex nulla affectione videt, praeterlabuntur, nec inseruntur memoriae, ita nec ei conjunguntur; [4] inde patet quod objecta visus externi implantentur secundum amoenum et jucundum affectionum, 
et quod in amoeno et jucundo illo sint; nam cum simile amoenum seu jucundum recurrit, etiam talia objecta recurrent {6}, pariter cum similia objecta, etiam tale amoenum et jucundum, 
cum varietate secundum status: consimiliter se habet cum intellectu, qui est visus internus, ejus objecta sunt spiritualia, et vera dicuntur, campus illorum objectorum est memoria, amoenum et jucundum 
illius visus est bonum; ita bonum est cui inseminantur et implantantur vera; inde aliquatenus constare potest quid insinuatio veri in bonum sit, et conjunctio veri in bono; tum quid bonum, {7} de 
quo hic agitur; de quo tam innumerabilia percipiunt angeli, cum homo vix aliquid.      @1 i supra$      @2 at$      @3 constituunt$      @4 visum oculi et per amoenum et jucundum$      @5
