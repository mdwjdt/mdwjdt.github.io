<h3 align="center" class="ired">属天的奥秘 第4468节</h3>
<h4 align="center"></h4><p><strong>4468.</strong>“成为一样的人民”表在教义上（联结起来）。这从“人民”的含义清楚可知，“人民”是指教会的真理，因而是指教义（参看<a href="1259.htm">1259</a>，<a href="1260.htm">1260</a>，<a href="3295.htm">3295</a>，<a href="3581.htm">3581</a>节）。“成为一样的人民”表示通过教义联结起来。有两样事物将教会成员联结起来，即生活和教义。当生活将他们联结在一起时，教义不会将他们分开；但若唯独教义将他们联结起来，如当今教会里面的情形，他们就会彼此分离，形成和教义一样多的教会；尽管教义是为生活而存在的，生活是教义所产生的结果。若唯独教义将他们联结起来，教会成员就会彼此分离；这种分离从以下事实明显看出来：认同这一种教义的人会定认同那一种教义之人的罪，有时甚至判他们下地狱。但若生活将教会成员联结起来，那么教义就不会把他们分开。这一点从以下事实明显看出来：过着良善生活的人不会定持不同观点之人的罪，而把这个问题归结到他的信仰和良知上。这就是他对教会之外的人所持的态度；因为他会在心里说，无知不会定他们当中任何人的罪，只要他们像小孩子那样过着纯真和相爱的生活，因为小孩子死后也处于无知当中。</p>

And we will be for one people. That this signifies conjunction in respect to doctrine also, is evident from the signification of "people," as being the truth of the church, consequently doctrine (see 
n. 1259, 1260, 3295, 3581). Thus "to be for one people," denotes conjunction by doctrine. There are two things which conjoin together the men of the church, namely, life and doctrine. When the life conjoins 
them, the doctrine does not separate them; but if the doctrine alone conjoins them, as is the case at this day within the church, they then separate from one another and make as many churches 
as there are doctrines; although the doctrine is for the sake of the life, and the life is from the doctrine. That the men of the church separate from one another if the doctrine alone conjoins them, 
is evident from the fact that a man who is of one doctrine will condemn him who is of another doctrine, sometimes to hell. But that the doctrine does not separate the men of the church if the life conjoins 
them, is evident from the fact that a man who is in goodness of life does not condemn another who is of a different opinion, but leaves the matter to his faith and conscience, and this even as regards 
those who are outside the church; for he says in his heart that ignorance cannot condemn any who live in innocence and mutual love, as do little children, who also are in ignorance when they die. </p>

'And we will be one people' means being joined together in doctrine. This is clear from the meaning of 'people' as the truth of the Church, and therefore doctrine, <a href="1259.htm">1259</a>, <a href="1260.htm">1260</a>, <a href="3295.htm">3295</a>, <a href="3581.htm">3581</a>. 'Being one 
people' accordingly means being joined together through doctrine. There are two things which join members of the Church together - life and doctrine. When life joins them together doctrine does not separate 
them, but if doctrine alone joins them together, as happens within the Church at the present day, they separate themselves from one another and form as many Churches as there are varieties of doctrine, 
even though doctrine exists for the sake of life, and life ensues from doctrine. Their separation from one another if doctrine alone joins them together is evident from the fact that a person 
who subscribes to one doctrine condemns him who subscribes to another, sometimes to hell. But doctrine does not separate people if life joins them together. This is evident from the fact that a person 
who leads a good life does not condemn another because he has a feeling about something different from his own but leaves it be as a matter of the other's faith and conscience. And this is an attitude 
which he adopts even towards those outside the Church, for he says in his heart that ignorance cannot condemn any of them, provided that they lead lives of innocence and mutual love, as young children 
do, who also, if they die, are in ignorance. </p>

`Et erimus in populum unum': quod significet quoad doctrinam etiam conjunctionem,' constat ex significatione `populi' quod sit verum Ecclesiae, proinde doctrina, de qua n. 1259, 1260, 3295, 3581; 
ita `esse in populum unum' est conjunctio per doctrinam.  (s)Sunt duo quae conjungunt homines Ecclesiae, nempe vita et doctrina; quando {1} vita conjungit, doctrina non separat, sed si solum doctrina 
conjungit, sicut hodie fit intra Ecclesiam {2}, tunc se mutuo separant, et tot faciunt Ecclesias quot sunt doctrinae; cum tamen doctrina sit propter vitam et vita ex doctrina; quod se separent 
{3}, si solum doctrina conjungit, patet ex eo quod qui ab una doctrina est, damnet alterum, quandoque ad infernum; at quod doctrina non separet si vita conjungit {4}, patet ex eo quod qui in bonitate 
vitae est, non damnet alterum qui aliter sentit, sed illius fidei et conscientiae id (x)relinquat, et hoc usque ad illos qui extra Ecclesiam sunt; dicit enim corde quod ignorantia neminem damnare 
possit, si vivant in innocentia et mutuo amore, sicut infantes, qui quoque in ignorantia sunt cum {5} obeunt.(s)      @1 cum$      @2 in Ecclesia$      @3 after following conjungit$      @4 after 
at$      @5 A has full stop after sunt. Cum obeunt is a later addition.$ </p>
