<h3 align="center" class="ired">属天的奥秘 第6265节</h3>
<h4 align="center"></h4><p><strong>6265.</strong>“约瑟把他们从以色列两腿中领出来”表意愿的良善和理解力的真理从属灵良善那一方的爱之情感那里被领出来。这从“约瑟”、玛拿西和以法莲的代表，以及“腿”的含义清楚可知：“约瑟”是指内在属天层（参看<a href="5869.htm">5869</a>，<a href="5877.htm">5877</a>节）；“约瑟领出来”的玛拿西和以法莲是指意愿的良善和理解力的真理（<a href="5354.htm">5354</a>，<a href="6222.htm">6222</a>节）；“两腿”是指爱之情感（<a href="3021.htm">3021</a>，<a href="4277.htm">4277</a>，<a href="4280.htm">4280</a>，<a href="4575.htm">4575</a>，<a href="5050.htm">5050</a>-<a href="5062.htm">5062</a>节）。之所以说“属灵良善那一方”，是因为他们是从代表属灵良善的以色列（参看<a href="6253.htm">6253</a>节）那里被领出来的。此处这些话的意思是，内在属天层将意愿的良善和理解力的真理从属灵良善，也就是从它的爱之情感那里带走；它们之所以具有这种含义，是因为代表属灵良善的“以色列”使这良善与真理靠近他自己；此外，他们被约瑟带到他那里，约瑟代表内在属天层；因此，他们被带走，后来又被约瑟带到他那里，如下文所描述的。<br />对这一切的解释是，爱的流注以这种方式通过属灵良善从内在属天层进入这良善与真理。这一切都符合正常次序；因此，当他们要接受祝福时，必须严格遵守这外在仪式；因为那时，他们被呈现在主，就是此处“祝福”所表示的预言的源头面前（参看<a href="6254.htm">6254</a>节）。这解释了为何约瑟将他的儿子从他父亲两腿中领出来，以及为何后来他自己又把他们带到他这里。</p>

And Joseph brought them away from his thighs. That this signifies the good of the will and the truth of the intellectual from the affection of love on the part of spiritual good, is evident from the 
representation of Joseph, as being the internal celestial (see n. 5869, 5877); from the representation of Manasseh and Ephraim, whom Joseph brought away, as being the good of the will and the truth of 
the intellectual (n. 5354, 6222); and from the signification of "thighs," as being the affection of love (n. 3021, 4277, 4280, 4575, 5050-5062). That it was "on the part of spiritual good" is because 
they were brought away from Israel, who is spiritual good (see n. 6253). By these things is signified that the internal celestial removed the good of the will and the truth of the intellectual from spiritual 
good, that is, from the affection of love thereof, because Israel, by whom is represented spiritual good, had caused this good and truth to approach to himself; besides their being brought to 
him by Joseph, by whom is represented the internal celestial; for which reason they were brought away, and were afterward brought again by Joseph, as follows. The reason is, that there is in this way 
an influx of love from the internal celestial through spiritual good into them. For this is according to order, and hence this external ritual had to be rigidly observed when they were to be blessed; 
for they were then being presented before the Lord, from whom is the prediction here signified by the "blessing" (see n. 6254). Hence then it is that Joseph brought his sons from the thighs of his father, 
and himself afterward brought them thither. </p>

'And Joseph brought them away from his thighs' means that the good belonging to the will and the truth belonging to the understanding were brought away from an affection originating in love on the part 
of spiritual good. This is clear from the representation of 'Joseph' as the internal celestial, dealt with in <a href="5869.htm">5869</a>, <a href="5877.htm">5877</a>; from the representation of Manasseh and Ephraim, the ones here whom 'Joseph 
brought away', as the good belonging to the will and the truth belonging to the understanding, dealt with in <a href="5354.htm">5354</a>, <a href="6222.htm">6222</a>; from the meaning of 'the thighs' as an affection originating in love, dealt with 
in <a href="3021.htm">3021</a>, <a href="4277.htm">4277</a>, <a href="4280.htm">4280</a>, <a href="4575.htm">4575</a>, <a href="5050.htm">5050</a>-<a href="5062.htm">5062</a>; and on the part of spiritual good is meant because they were brought away from Israel, who represents spiritual good, <a href="6253.htm">6253</a>. The words used here mean that the internal 
celestial took good belonging to the will and truth belonging to the understanding away from spiritual good, that is, away from the affection arising from its love; they have this meaning because 
'Israel', who represents spiritual good, had made that goodness and truth draw near him. Besides this they had to be brought to him by Joseph, who represents the internal celestial; for that reason 
they were brought away and after that, as described in what follows, were brought to him again by Joseph. </p>

 The explanation for all this is that the inflow of love came to that goodness and truth 
from the internal celestial by way of spiritual good - in keeping with true order. That external procedure had therefore to be strictly adhered to when they were going to be blessed; for they were 
being presented to the Lord, the Source of the foretelling meant here by the blessing, <a href="6254.htm">6254</a>. This now explains why Joseph brought his sons away from his father's thighs, and why he himself after that 
brought them to him again. </p>

`Et abduxit Joseph illos ex femoribus {1}': quod significet bonum voluntarii et verum intellectualis ab affectione amoris a parte boni spiritualis, constat ex repraesentatione `Josephi' quod sit caeleste 
internum, de qua n. 5869, 5877; ex repraesentatione `Menashis et Ephraimi' qui hic sunt illi equos Joseph abduxit', quod sint bonum voluntarii et verum intellectualis, de qua n. 5354, 6222; ex significatione 
`femorum' quod sit affectio amoris, de qua n. 3021, 4277, 4280, 4575, 5050-5062; quod a parte boni spiritualis, est ab `Israele' qui est bonum spirituale, n. 6253. Per haec significatur 
quod caeleste internum removerit bonum voluntarii et verum intellectualis a bono spirituali, hoc est, ab affectione amoris illius, quia `Israel' per quem repraesentatur bonum spirituale, accedere fecit 
bonum et verum illud ad se, praeter quod adducerentur ad illum `a Josepho' per quem repraesentatur caeleste internum, quapropter abducebantur, et dein a Josepho adducebantur, ut sequitur; [2] causa 
est (m)quia sic influxus amoris est a caelesti interno per bonum spirituale in illa (n); (s)hoc enim est secundum ordinem; et inde erat hoc rituale externum, {2} cum benedicerentur, stricte observandum; 
sistebantur enim tunc coram Domino, a Quo praedictio quae hic significatur per benedictionem, n. 6254. (s)Inde nunc est quod `Joseph {3}duxerit filios suos a femoribus patris sui, et ipse dein (t)adduxerit
