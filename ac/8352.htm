<h3 align="center" class="ired">属天的奥秘 第8352节</h3>
<h4 align="center"></h4><p><strong>8352.</strong>“说，我们喝什么呢”表他们无法忍受真理，因为这些真理由于缺乏对良善的情感而令他们不快。这从“喝”的含义清楚可知，“喝”是指在真理上接受教导并领受它们 ，也指对它们拥有一种情感，因而将它们变成自己的（参看<a href="3069.htm">3069</a>，<a href="3168.htm">3168</a>，<a href="3772.htm">3772</a>，<a href="4017.htm">4017</a>，<a href="4018.htm">4018</a>节）；但此处是指无法忍受它们，因为它们由于缺乏对良善的情感而令人不快；根据前面的解释（<a href="8349.htm">8349</a>节），“水是苦的”就表示它们缺乏对良善的情感。这试探在于以下事实：他们抱怨、悲伤，因为以前他们觉得令人愉快，并由此构成他们属灵生命或天堂生命的真理现在对他们来说，似乎不愉快了，并且如此令人不愉快，以致他们几乎无法忍受它们。<br />纯属世人无法相信这种事会造成任何悲伤。因为他会想：“真理是否令人愉快跟我有什么关系？如果它们令人不快，把它们扔掉好了”。但属灵人却有完全不同的感想。学习真理并在诸如属于他的灵魂，因而属于他的属灵生命的那类事物上受启示是他生活的乐趣。因此，当这些真理是缺乏的时，他的属灵生命对他来说就成了一种考验和负担；这会产生悲伤和焦虑。原因在于，对良善的情感不断从主经由内在人流入，唤起外在人中相一致的事物，这些事物之前曾引发属于对真理的一种情感的快乐；当这些事物被爱自己爱世界的邪恶攻击，而这个人以前也曾以这些邪恶为快乐时，快乐或情感的冲突就会产生，焦虑就源于此，这反过来又导致悲伤和报怨。<br />有必要对试探通过真理的缺乏产生时的情形作一个简短的陈述。属灵生命的营养是良善和真理，正如属世生命的营养是饮食。缺乏良善，如同缺乏食物；缺乏真理，如同缺乏喝的。由此导致的悲伤就像饥渴所造成的悲伤。这种对比源自对应关系，因为食物对应于良善，喝的对应于真理。正是由于这种对应关系的存在，所以如果一个人在吃晚餐或午餐的同时，还享有与其他人谈论他所喜爱的那类事物的快乐，那么食物和喝的对身体的滋养，要比他独自坐在餐桌前，没有陪伴时更好、更适宜。在第二种情况下，人接受食物的容器会变窄；但在第一种情况下，这些容器会打开。这些事是通过属灵食物与属世食物的对应关系实现的。之所以说“与其他人谈论他所喜爱的那类事物的快乐”，是因为所有这些快乐都与良善和真理有关；因为与这二者无关的事物在世上不存在。人所爱的与他所具有的良善有关；而教导他良善，并由此与这良善结合的，则与真理有关。</p>

Saying, What shall we drink? That this signifies that they could not endure truths because they were undelightful by reason of no affection of them, is evident from the signification of "drinking," as 
being to be instructed in truths and to receive them, and also to be affected with them, and consequently to appropriate them to oneself (see n. 3069, 3168, 3772, 4017, 4018); here, not to endure them, 
for the reason that they were undelightful on account of there being no affection of good, which is signified by "the waters being bitter," according to what has been unfolded above (n. 8349). This 
temptation consists in the fact that they complain and grieve because the truths which had previously been delightful to them, and which thus had made their spiritual life or life of heaven, now seem 
undelightful to them, insomuch that they can scarcely endure them. [2] The merely natural man would not believe that such a thing could cause any grief, for he thinks, "What is it to me whether truths 
are delightful or not? If they are undelightful let them be rejected." But the spiritual man has very different sentiments. It is the delight of his life to be instructed in truths, and to be enlightened 
in such things as belong to his soul, thus to his spiritual life; and therefore when these fail, his spiritual life labors and suffers, and grief and anxiety ensue. The reason is that the affection 
of good is continually flowing in through the internal man from the Lord, and calling forth the accordant things in the external man which had previously caused the delight of the affection of truth; 
and when these things are assaulted by the evils of the love of self and of the world, which the man had also previously perceived as delightful, there arises a conflict of delights or of affections, 
from which springs anxiety, and from this grief and complaint. [3] It shall be briefly told how the case is with the temptation that arises through a failing of truth. The nourishment of the spiritual 
life is good and truth, as the nourishment of the natural life is food and drink. If good fails, it is as if food fails; and if truth fails, it is as if drink fails. The consequent grief is circumstanced 
like the grief from hunger and thirst. This comparison is from correspondence, for food corresponds to good, and drink to truth; and as there is a correspondence, food and drink also nourish 
the body better and more suitably when a man at dinner or at breakfast is at the same time in the delight of conversation with others about such things as he loves, than when he sits at table alone 
without company. When a man is in this state, the vessels in him that receive the food are constricted; but when he is in the first mentioned state, they are open. Such things are effected by the correspondence 
of spiritual food and natural food. It is said "the delight of conversation with others about such things as he loves," because everything of this kind has relation to good and truth; for 
there is nothing in the world which has not relation to both. What a man loves, has relation to the good with him; and what instructs him about good, and thus conjoins itself with it, has relation to 
the truth. </p>

<p align="center"><b>Elliott(1983-1999) 8352</b></p><p><b>8352.</b>
'Saying, What shall we drink?' means that they cannot tolerate truths because, as a result of their lack of affection [for good], they find them unpleasant. This is clear from the meaning of 'drinking' 
as being taught truths and receiving them, and also as having an affection for them and consequently making them one's own, dealt with in <a href="3069.htm">3069</a>, <a href="3168.htm">3168</a>, <a href="3772.htm">3772</a>, <a href="4017.htm">4017</a>, <a href="4018.htm">4018</a>, but here as not being able to 
tolerate them because - as a result of the lack of affection for good, meant by 'the waters were bitter', according to the explanation above in <a href="8349.htm">8349</a> - they are found to be unpleasant. This temptation 
consists in their complaining and their grief, because the truths which previously they have found pleasant, and which have thus constituted their spiritual life or the life of heaven for them, now seem 
unpleasant to them, so unpleasant that they can scarcely tolerate them. </p>
<p></p>
<p><b>[2]</b>
 A merely natural person cannot believe that anything such as this could be a cause of grief. For he thinks, 'What difference 
does it make to me whether truths are pleasant or unpleasant? If they are unpleasant, let them be cast aside.' But a spiritual person has an entirely different feeling. Learning truths and being 
enlightened in the kinds of matters that belong to his soul and so to spiritual life is the delight of his life. Therefore when those truths are lacking, his spiritual life becomes a trial and burden 
to him; and this gives rise to grief and anguish. The reason is that the affection for good flows in unceasingly from the Lord by way of the internal man, arousing accordant things in the external 
man which have previously been the cause of delight belonging to an affection for truth; and when these things are under attack from the evils of self-love and love of the world, in which too the person 
has previously taken delight, a conflict of delights or affections results, which gives rise to anguish, and this in turn to grief and complaint. </p>
<p></p>
<p><b>[3]</b>
 A brief statement needs to be made about the 
situation when temptation arises through lack of truth. Nourishment for spiritual life consists in goodness and truth, just as nourishment for natural life consists in food and drink. If good is lacking 
it is as if food is lacking; and when truth is lacking it is as if drink is lacking. The grief this causes is like the grief caused by hunger and thirst. This comparison arises from correspondence, 
for food corresponds to goodness, and drink to truth. This correspondence is also the reason why food and drink nourish the body better and more suitably if, during a dinner or a luncheon, the person 
has at the same time as he eats the pleasure of discussing with others the kinds of things he loves than if he sits at table alone without company. In the second situation the person's vessels for receiving 
food are narrowed, but in the first the same vessels are opened. These things are brought about by the correspondence of spiritual food and natural food. The reason for saying the pleasure of 
discussing with others the kinds of things he loves is that all that pleasure is related to goodness and truth; for there does not exist anything in the world that is unrelated to them both. What the 
person loves is related to the good present with him, and that which informs about good and so links itself to that good, is related to truth. </p>

`Dicendo, Quid bibemus?': quod significet quod non sustineant vera, quia injucunda ex nulla illorum affectione, constat ex significatione `bibere' quod sit instrui in veris ac illa recipere, tum quoque 
illis affici, et inde sibi illa appropriare, de qua n. 3069, 3168, 3772, 4017, 4018, hic illa non sustinere ex causa quia injucunda propter nullam affectionem boni, quae significantur per quod `aquae 
amarae essent,' secundum illa quae supra n. 8349 explicata sunt.  Tentatio haec in eo consistit quod querantur et indoleant quod vera quae prius illis jucunda fuerunt, et quae sic fecerunt vitam spiritualem 
seu vitam caeli illorum, nunc illis appareant injucunda usque adeo ut vix possint illa sustinere. 	2 Mere naturalis homo crederet quod tale nihil doloris posset causari, cogitat enim, Quid 
mihi cum veris, sive jucunda sive injucunda sint? si injucunda, rejiciantur; at spiritualis homo prorsus aliter sentit; jucundum vitae (c)illius est instrui in veris et illustrari in talibus quae animae 
ejus sunt, ita quae vitae spiritualis, quare cum (c)illa deficiunt, laborat et patitur vita {1}illa, inde dolor et anxietas; causa est quod affectio boni jugiter influat per internum hominem a Domino, 
et excitet in externo convenientia quae prius causata sunt jucundum affectionis veri, quae cum impugnantur a malis amoris sui et mundi, quae prius etiam ut jucunda {2}perceperat, inde conflictio 
jucunditatum seu affectionum, ex qua anxietas, et ex hoc indolentia et querimonia. 	3 (s)Paucis dicetur quomodo {3}cum tentatione quae existit per deficientiam veri se habet: nutricio vitae spiritualis 
est bonum et verum, sicut nutricio vitae naturalis est cibus et potus; si deficit bonum est sicut deficit cibus, et si deficit verum est sicut deficit potus; indolentia inde se habet sicut indolentia 
ex fame et siti; comparatio haec est ex correspondentia, cibus enim correspondet bono, et potus vero {4}, et quia correspondentia est, etiam cibus et potus nutriunt corpus melius et convenientius, 
{5}cum homo ad cenam aut prandium simul {6}est in jucundo loquelae cum aliis de talibus quae {7}amat, quam cum solus absque consortio ad mensam sedet; cum homo in hoc statu est, tunc apud illum vasa recipientia 
cibi constricta sunt, at cum in illo statu est, tunc eadem aperta sunt; talia facit correspondentia cibi spiritualis et cibi naturalis; dicitur jucundum loquelae cum aliis de talibus quae {8}amat, 
quia omne id se refert ad bonum et verum, non enim datur aliquid in mundo quod non ad utrumque hoc se refert; ad bonum apud hominem se refert id quod amat, et ad verum quod instruit de bono, et 
sic cum illo se conjungit.(s) 	@1 ejus$ 	@2 apperceperat$ 	@3 tentatio$ 	@4 i in spirituali mundo$ 	@5 dum$ 	@6 After loquelae$ 	@7 amant$ 	@8 amant altered to amat$ </p>
