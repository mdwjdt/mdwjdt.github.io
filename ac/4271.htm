<h4 align="center"></h4><p><strong>4271.</strong>“他带着他们，打发他们过河，又打发他所有的都过去”表进一步注入。这从刚才所述清楚可知，因为他不仅让妻子、使女和儿子过去，还让牛群和羊群，因而他所有的都过去，进入他与以扫相会所在迦南地。由于就内义而言，所论述的主题属世层里面真理与良善的结合，故“过河”无非表示第一次注入；此处同样的事又重述了一遍，还补充说他打发他所有的都过去，以表示进一步的注入。</p>

<p align="center"><b>Potts(1905-1910) 4271</b></p><p><b>4271.</b>
And he took them, and caused them to pass the river, and caused to pass what he had. That this signifies further instilling is evident from what has been said just above; for he caused to pass not only 
the women, the handmaids, and the sons, but also the herd and flock, thus all that he had, into the land of Canaan, in which he met Esau. And as the subject treated of in the internal sense is the 
conjunction of truth with good in the natural, by passing over the river nothing else is signified than the first instilling; and here where the same things are still said, and it is also added that he 
caused to pass all that he had, there is signified further instilling. </p>

<p align="center"><b>Elliott(1983-1999) 4271</b></p><p><b>4271.</b>
'And he took them and made them pass over the river, and made all that he had pass over' means a further instillation. This is clear from what has been stated immediately above, for he made not only 
wives, servant-girls, and sons pass over but also herds and flocks, and so everything he had, into the land of Canaan in which he met Esau. And since the subject in the internal sense is the joining together 
of truth and good within the natural, 'passing over the river' means nothing else than the first instillation, and here where the same words are repeated, with the addition of the phrase about 
his making all that he had pass over, a further instillation is meant. </p>

<p align="center"><b>Latin(1748-1756) 4271</b>
</p><b>4271.</b>
`Et accepit illos, et transire fecit illos fluvium, et transire fecit quae sibi': quod significet ulteriorem insinuationem, constat ex illis quae mox supra dicta sunt, transire enim fecit non solum 
feminas, ancillas et natos sed etiam armentum et gregem, ita omnia quae erant sibi, in terram Canaanem in qua occurrebat Esavo; et quia agitur in sensu interno de conjunctione veri cum bono in naturali, 
per `transire fluvium illum' non aliud significatur quam insinuatio prima, et hic ubi adhuc eadem dicuntur, et quoque additur quod `transire fecerit omnia quae sibi,' significatur insinuatio 
ulterior. </p>
