<h3 align="center" class="ired">属天的奥秘 第10216节</h3>
<h4 align="center"></h4><p><strong>10216</strong>.“你要计算以色列人的总数”表教会的全部事物。这从“总数”的含义和“以色列人”的代表清楚可知：“总数”是指全部；“以色列人”是指教会（参看<a href="9340.htm">9340</a>节提到的地方）。“以色列人的总数”之所以表示教会的全部事物，是因为圣言的内义就是它在天堂所具有的那种意义。名字不会到达那里的天使，如以色列、摩西、亚伦等名字，以及其它许多名字；因为这些名字属于物质事物，而物质事物只是为了人在肉体感官层面的生活而存在的。所感知到的不是这些名字，而是属于天堂和教会的属灵层面的事物。因为天上的天使是属灵的，凡引起他们注意的事物，他们都是照着这些事物的内在性质，因而在属灵层面上来理解。在那里，他们之所以将以色列人理解为教会，是因为在至内层天堂，就是主的同在比下面的天堂更直接的地方，圣言中的名字当用于好的意义时，被理解为主，如这些名字：亚伯拉罕，以撒，雅各，摩西，亚伦，大卫，约瑟，犹大或以色列。那里的天使因将这些名字理解为主，所以也照着圣言的思路而将这些名字感知为属于天堂和教会，并源于主的神性事物。感知是从主，就是圣言流入的；因为主是一切聪明和智慧的源头，没有祂，什么都没有。</p>

When thou shalt take up the sum of the sons of Israel. That this signifies all things of the church, is evident from the signification of "the sum," as being all; and from the representation of "the 
sons of Israel," as being the church (see the places cited in n. 9340). That all things of the church are signified by "the sum of the sons of Israel," is because the internal sense of the Word is such 
as is its sense in the heavens, for thither names do not pass, as the names of Israel, Moses, Aaron, and many others; for these names are amid material things, which are solely for the man of the bodily 
senses; but in their place are perceived spiritual things that belong to heaven and the church. The angels of heaven are spiritual, and apprehend whatever occurs according to its essence, that is, 
spiritually. That in heaven instead of the sons of Israel they understand the church, is because in the inmost heaven, where the Lord is more present than in the heavens beneath, by the names in the 
Word, in a good sense, is understood the Lord Himself; as by Abraham, Isaac, Jacob, Moses, Aaron, David, Joseph, Judah, and Israel. And as by these names is there understood the Lord, therefore the Divine 
things of heaven and of the church, which are from the Lord, are perceived by the same names in accordance with the connection of the things in the Word. Perception flows in from the Lord, who is 
the Word; for everything of intelligence and wisdom is from the Lord, and without Him there is none at all. </p>

'When you take the sum of the children of Israel' means all things of the Church. This is clear from the meaning of 'the sum' as all; and from the representation of 'the children of Israel' as the Church, 
dealt with in the places referred to in <a href="9340.htm">9340</a>. The reason why all things of the Church are meant by 'the sum of the children of Israel' is that the internal sense of the Word is the kind of meaning 
it has in the heavens. Names do not come through to those there, such as the names Israel, Moses, Aaron, and many others; for those names belong to things that are material, which exist solely for 
the benefit of human life on the level of the physical senses. Instead of those names things on a spiritual level that belong to heaven and the Church are perceived. For angels in heaven are spiritual, 
and the things that come to their attention they see according to the inner nature of those things, thus on a spiritual level. There in place of the children of Israel they understand the Church. They 
do so because in the inmost heaven, where the Lord's presence is more immediate than in the heavens below, the Lord Himself is understood by names in the Word, when they are used in a good sense, names 
such as Abraham, Isaac, Jacob, Moses, Aaron, David, Joseph, Judah, or Israel. And since the angels there understand the Lord by these names, they also perceive - in accord with the train of thought 
in the Word - the Divine things which belong to heaven and the Church, and are derived from the Lord. The perception flows in from the Lord, who is the Word; for the Lord is the source of all intelligence 
and wisdom, and none at all exists without Him.  </p>

`Cum sustuleris summam filiorum Israelis': quod significet omnia Ecclesiae, constat ex significatione `summae' quod {1}sit omne, et ex repraesentatione `filiorum Israelis' quod sint Ecclesia, de qua 
citata n. 9340. Quod sint omnia Ecclesiae quae per `summam filiorum Israelis' (x)significantur, est quia sensus internus {2}Verbi est qualis sensus ejus in caelis; illuc non transeunt nomina, ut nomina 
Israel, Moscheh, Aharon, et plura, ea enim sunt inter res materiales, quae solum pro corporeo sensuali homine sunt, at loco illorum {3}percipiuntur res spiritualiter quae sunt caeli et Ecclesiae; nam 
angeli caeli sunt spirituales, et quae obveniunt, ea secundum essentiam suam, hoc est, spiritualiter (x)capiunt. Quod ibi pro filiis Israelis {4}intelligant Ecclesiam, est quia in intimo caelo, ubi 
Dominus praesentior est quam in caelis infra, per nomina in Verbo, in sensu bono, intelligitur Ipse Dominus, ut per Abrahamum, Isacum, Jacobum, Moschen, Aharonem, Davidem, Josephum, Jehudam, Israelem; 
et quia per illa intelligitur Dominus ibi, inde Divina quae caeli et Ecclesiae, quae a Domino, secundum rerum series in Verbo, per eadem percipiuntur; perceptio a Domino, Qui est Verbum, influit, nam 
a Domino est omne intelligentiae et sapientiae, et absque Ipso nihil. @1 sint omnia$ @2 est qualis est sensus Verbi$ @3 capiuntur$ @4 percipiant$ </p>
