<h3 align="center" class="ired">属天的奥秘 第10612节</h3>
<h4 align="center"></h4><p><strong>10612</strong>.“照耶和华所吩咐他的”表这种事是由于他们的坚持才做的。这从“耶和华吩咐”的含义清楚可知，当论及圣言由于以色列民族而取、由摩西所凿出的两块石版来表示的那种外在形式时，“耶和华吩咐”是指这种事是由于他们的坚持才做的。在圣言中，凡论述以色列民族和建立在他们当中的代表性敬拜的地方，经上都会说“耶和华吩咐”。但祂吩咐并不意味着祂乐意，仅仅是说祂允许这种事由于他们的坚持而成就；因为他们坚持要把他们领进迦南地，耶和华要与他们同住，所以教会要建立在他们当中（关于他们的这种坚持，可参看<a href="10430.htm">10430</a>，<a href="10535.htm">10535</a>节）。举个例子，他们要在祭坛上献燔祭、祭牲、素祭和奠祭，关于它们的律法被制定，而且经上还说这是耶和华吩咐给他们的；而事实上，这些事不是被吩咐或命令的，仅仅是被允许的，这从前面（<a href="2180.htm">2180</a>节）所引用的圣言经文可以看出来。这同样适用于他们被允许娶多个妻子，并以任何理由出具休书；而事实上，这不是耶和华所吩咐的，尽管经上如此说；这仅仅是由于他们心硬而被允许的（马太福音<a href="http://39-27.cn/太19.7.htm">19:7</a>，<a href="http://39-27.cn/太19.8.htm">8</a>）。在耶和华所吩咐的其它许多事上同样如此</p>

As Jehovah commanded him. That this signifies that it was so done because they insisted, is evident from the signification of "Jehovah commanded," when said of the external of the Word such as it was 
on account of the Israelitish nation, which is signified by the two tables of stones hewn by Moses, as being that it was so done because they insisted. In the Word throughout, where the Israelitish nation 
and the representative worship instituted among them are treated of, it is said that "Jehovah commanded," and by this is not signified what is well-pleasing, but permission that it should be so 
done because they insisted; for they insisted on being brought into the land of Canaan, and that Jehovah should be with them, consequently that a church should be instituted among them (that they so insisted, 
see n. 10430, 10535). Take for example that they were to offer upon the altars burnt-offerings, sacrifices, meat-offerings, and drink-offerings, concerning which many laws were delivered; and 
of which it is also said that Jehovah commanded them; when yet these things were not commanded or ordered, but were permitted, as can be seen from the passages adduced from the Word in n. 2180. In like 
manner that they were allowed to marry a number of wives, and to give a bill of divorce for any cause whatever; when yet Jehovah did not command this, although it is so said; but only permitted it 
on account of the hardness of their hearts (Matt. 19:7, 8); and so with many other things. </p>

'As Jehovah had commanded him' means that such a thing should be done because of their insistence. This is clear from the meaning of 'Jehovah had commanded' - when the subject is the kind of outward 
form the Word takes on account of the Israelite nation, meant by 'the two tablets of stone' hewn by Moses - as that such a thing should be done because of their insistence. Various places in the Word 
which refer to the Israelite nation and the representative worship established among them state that Jehovah commanded this or that. But His good pleasure is not meant by His commanding it, only His permission 
that such a thing should be done because of their insistence; for they were insistent that they should be led into the land of Canaan and that Jehovah should reside with them, consequently that 
the Church should be established among them. Regarding that insistence, see <a href="10430.htm">10430</a>, <a href="10535.htm">10535</a>. Take for instance their presentation on altars of burnt offerings, sacrifices, minchahs, and drink offerings, 
regarding which very many laws were laid down and which also Jehovah is said to have commanded; these were not in fact commanded or decreed, only permitted, as may be recognized from the places quoted 
from the Word in <a href="2180.htm">2180</a>. The like applies to their being allowed to have a number of wives and to give a certificate of divorce for any reason whatever; Jehovah did not in fact command this, although 
it says that He did, but only permitted it on account of their hardness of heart, <a href="http://bible.gospelcom.net/cgi-bin/bible?passage=Matt%2019:7,8&amp;version=ESV&amp;interface=print&amp;showfn=yes&amp;showxref">Matt 19:7,8</a>. The same is so with very many other things that Jehovah is said to have commanded.  </p>

`Quemadmodum praecepit Jehovah illi':  quod significet quod ita fieret (x)quia institerunt, constat ex significatione `praecepit Jehovah' cum de externo Verbi tali propter gentem Israeliticam, quod 
significatur per `duas tabulas lapidum dolatas a Mosche' quod sit quod ita fieret quia institerunt; in Verbo passim dicitur, ubi de gente Israelitica et de cultu repraesentativo apud illam instituto, 
quod Jehovah {1}praeceperit, ac per id non significatur beneplacitum, {2} sed permissio quod ita fieret quia institerunt; institerunt enim quod illi introducerentur in terram Canaanem et quod {3}Jehovah 
apud illos esset, consequenter quod apud illos Ecclesia institueretur; quod institerint, videatur n. 10430, 10535.  {4}Sit pro exemplo quod super altaribus offerent holocausta, sacrificia, minhas, 
et libamina, de quibus plures leges latae sunt, de quibus etiam dicitur quod Jehovah praeceperit, cum tamen illa non praecepta seu mandata sunt sed permissa, ut constare potest ex locis e Verbo allatis 
n. 2180; similiter quod plures uxores liceret ducere, ac libellum repudii dare ob quamcumque causam, cum tamen Jehovah id non praeceperit, tametsi ita dicitur, sed modo permiserit ob duritiem cordis 
eorum, Matth. xix 7, 8; ita in pluribus aliis. @1 praecepit, sed$ @2 i nec consensus,$ @3 After illos$ @4 sicut pro exemplo quod liceat plures uxores ducere, et libellum repudii dare ob quamcunque

et libamina, de quibus plures leges latae sunt, de quibus etiam dicitur quod Jehovah praecepit, cum tamen illa non praecepta seu mandata sunt, sed permissa, ut constare potest ex locis e Verbo allatis 
n. 2180 ita in pluribus aliis; inde constare potest, unde est quod per praecepit Jehovah, hic significetur quod ita fieret, quia institerunt; quod institerint, videatur n. 10430, 10535$ </p>
