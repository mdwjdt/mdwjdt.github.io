<h3 align="center" class="ired">属天的奥秘 第1038节</h3>
<h4 align="center"></h4><p><strong>1038.</strong>“这是立约的记号”表主以仁爱临在的标志。这从“立约”和“立约的记号”的含义清楚可知。前面已说明（创世记<a href="http://39-27.cn/创6.18.htm">6:18</a>，<a href="http://39-27.cn/创9.9.htm">9:9</a>），“立约”表主以仁爱临在。“立约”表主以爱和仁临在，这一点从立约的性质明显可知。立约的目的是结合，也就是说，是为了让人们生活在相互的友谊或爱中。这也是为何婚姻被称为圣约的原因。主与人的结合只存在于爱和仁中，因为主是爱本身和怜悯。祂愿意拯救每个人，以祂的大能将其吸引到天堂，即祂自己身边。谁都能由此知道并推论出，若不通过祂自己所是之物，即通过变得象祂那样，或与祂成为一体，换句话说，通过回以祂爱和爱邻如己，没人能与主结合。结合唯独以这种方式实现；这就是立约的精髓。结合由此产生后，自然会有主的临在。主的确与每个人同在，至于远近，则全取决于人距离爱的远近。<br />由于“立约”就是主藉着爱与人结合，或也可说，主以爱和仁与人同在，故在圣言中，立约本身被称为“平安的约”。因为“平安”表主的国，主的国在于相爱，平安唯独在于相爱，如以赛书所言：<br />大山可以挪开，小山可以迁移，但我的慈爱必不离开你，我平安的约也不迁移，这是耶和华，就是怜恤你的那一位说的。（以赛亚书<a href="http://39-27.cn/赛54.10.htm">54:10</a>）<br />此处怜悯，也就是爱的属性，被称为“平安的约”。以西结书：<br />我要为他们兴起一个牧人，祂要牧养他们，就是我的仆人大卫。祂必牧养他们，作他们的牧人。我必与他们立平安的约。（以西结书<a href="http://39-27.cn/结34.23.htm">34:23</a>，<a href="http://39-27.cn/结34.25.htm">25</a>）<br />此处，“大卫”明显用来表主，祂与重生之人的同在用“祂必牧养他们”来描述。<br />同一先知书：<br />我的仆人大卫必作他们的王，他们必都归一个牧人。并且我要与他们立平安的约；它必作为与他们的永约。我要赐福给他们，使他们增多，又在他们中间设立我的圣所，直到永远；我要作他们的神，他们要作我的子民。（以西结书<a href="http://39-27.cn/结37.24.htm">37:24</a>，<a href="http://39-27.cn/结37.26.htm">26</a>-<a href="http://39-27.cn/结37.27.htm">27</a>）<br />此处主同样用大卫来表示。爱用“在他们中间的圣所”来表示，主在爱中的临在和结合用被称为“平安的约”和“永约”的承诺，即“我要作他们的神，他们要作我的子民”来表示。<br />玛拉基书：<br />你们就知道我传这诫命给你们，使我与利未所立的约可以常存。这是万军之耶和华说的。我曾与他立生命和平安的约，我将这两样赐给他，使他存敬畏的心，他就敬畏我。（玛拉基书<a href="http://39-27.cn/玛2.4.htm">2:4</a>-<a href="http://39-27.cn/玛2.5.htm">5</a>）<br />在至高义上，“利未”表主，由此表拥有爱和仁之人，所以与利未所立“生命和平安的约”表在爱和仁中。<br />在摩西五经中，论到非尼哈：<br />看哪，我将我平安的约赐给他，这约要给他和他以后他的种，作为永远当祭司职任的约。（民数记<a href="http://39-27.cn/民25.12.htm">25:12</a>-<a href="http://39-27.cn/民25.13.htm">13</a>）<br />此处“非尼哈”并非用来表非尼哈，而是表他所代表的祭司职任，而祭司象征爱和属于爱之物，如教会的所有祭司职任。众所周知，非尼哈不会永远留在祭司职任上。<br />耶和华你的神是神自己，是信实的神，向爱他、守祂诫命的人守约施慈爱，直到千代。（申命记<a href="http://39-27.cn/申7.9.htm">7:9</a>，<a href="http://39-27.cn/申7.12.htm">12</a>）<br />“守约”在此明显表主在爱中与人同在，因为经上说“向爱他、守祂诫命的人守约施慈爱”。<br />由于“立约”就是主藉着爱与人结合，故可知，立约是通过属于爱的所有事物实现的，这些事物就是信之真理，被称为诫命。一切诫命，甚至律法和先知，都基于一条律法：即爱主高于一切和爱人如己，这从主的话明显可知（马太福音<a href="http://39-27.cn/太22.34.htm">22:34</a>-<a href="http://39-27.cn/太22.40.htm">40</a>；马可福音<a href="http://39-27.cn/可12.28.htm">12:28</a>-<a href="http://39-27.cn/可12.34.htm">34</a>）。这也是为何写有十诫的石版被称为“约版”的原因。立约或结合既通过爱的律法或诫命实现，故也通过主引入犹太教会并称为“法度”的社会法实现，还通过主所命定、称为“律例”的教会仪式实现。所有这些事物都被称为立约的律法，因为它们涉及爱和仁。如有关约西亚国王的论述：<br />王站在柱旁，在耶和华面前立约，要尽心尽性地顺从耶和华，遵守祂的诫命、法度、律例，成就这书上所记的约言。（列王记下<a href="http://39-27.cn/王下23.3.htm">23:3</a>）<br />从这些论述清楚可知何为立约，立约是内在的，因为主与人的结合是藉着内在事物，而非藉着脱离内在事物的外在事物实现的。外在事物只不过是这些内在事物的形像和代表，如同人的行为是其思维和意愿的形像和代表，又如同仁爱的行为是发自于内、存于心思意念中的仁爱的形像和代表。所以，犹太教会的一切仪式是主，因而是爱和仁，以及源于这些的一切事物的形像和代表。因此，立约或结合正是藉着人的内在事物实现的。外在事物不过是立约的标志，事实上，它们也被如此称呼。内在事物是实现立约或结合的手段，这是显而易见的，如耶利米书：<br />看哪，耶和华说，日子将到，我要与以色列家和犹大家另立新约，不像我与他们的祖宗所立的约，因为他们背了我的约。但那些日子以后，我与以色列家所立的约乃是这样：我要将我的律法放在他们中间，写在他们心上。（耶利米书<a href="http://39-27.cn/耶31.31.htm">31:31</a>-<a href="http://39-27.cn/耶31.33.htm">33</a>）<br />这论及一个新教会。这段经文清楚阐明圣约是藉着内在事物立下的，事实上是立在良知中，即律法被铭刻在良知上，而良知的全部律法都是爱的律法，如前所述。<br />外在事物并不构成圣约，除非它们与内在事物结合，并因着结合而一举一动皆行如一体；它们仅仅是圣约的“记号”，藉着它们如同藉着代表形像，使得主可以被记在心中。这从以下事实明显可知：安息日和割礼被称为圣约的“记号”。安息日被如此称呼，清楚可见于摩西五经：<br />以色列人世世代代都要守安息日，奉为永久的约。这是我和以色列人永远的记号。（出埃及记<a href="http://39-27.cn/出31.16.htm">31:16</a>-<a href="http://39-27.cn/出31.17.htm">17</a>）<br />割礼被称为“圣约的记号”，同样可见于摩西五经：<br />你们所有的男子都要受割礼，这就是我与你，并你以后你的种所立的约，是你们所当遵守的。你们都要割去包皮的肉，这就是我与你们立约的记号了。（创世记<a href="http://39-27.cn/创17.10.htm">17:10</a>-<a href="http://39-27.cn/创17.11.htm">11</a>）<br />由于同样的原因，血也被称为“立约的血”（出埃及记<a href="http://39-27.cn/出24.7.htm">24:7</a>-<a href="http://39-27.cn/出24.8.htm">8</a>）。<br />外在宗教仪式之所以被称为圣约的记号，主要是为了让人们可以通过它们将内在事物，就是它们所指之物记在心里。犹太教堂的所有宗教仪式没别的了。由于这个原因，它们也被称为记号，有助于人们忆起内在事物。例如，将主要戒律系在手上，戴在前额的做法，如摩西五经所说：<br />你要尽心、尽性、尽力爱耶和华你的神。你要这些话系在手上为记号，它们必如你两眼之间的额前饰。（申命记<a href="http://39-27.cn/申6.5.htm">6:5</a>，<a href="http://39-27.cn/申6.8.htm">8</a>；<a href="http://39-27.cn/申11.13.htm">11:13</a>，<a href="http://39-27.cn/申11.18.htm">18</a>）<br />“手”在此表意愿，因为它表力量，而力量出于意愿；“两眼之间的额前饰”表觉知；因而“记号”表忆起主要戒律，或总的律法，以便它不断存在于意愿和思维中，也就是说，主和爱的临在存在于整个意愿和整个思维中。这就是主的临在，以及相爱通过主而在天使身上的临在。蒙主慈悲，我将在后面进一步描述这种持续的临在。同样，本节经文所说“这是立约的记号，是我在我与你们之间所立的，并与同你们一起的一切活的灵魂直到万代之间所立的。我把我的彩虹放在云彩中，这就可作我与地立约的记号了”，并非表其它记号，而是指主以仁爱临在的标志，因而是指人对主的忆起。不过，至于云彩中的彩虹如何成为记号和忆起，蒙主慈悲，这将在下文予以讨论。</p>

<p><strong>[NCE]1038.</strong> The meaning of this is the sign of the pact as an indication of the presence of the Lord in neighborly love is established by the symbolism of a pact and of a sign of a pact. The symbolism of a pact as the presence of the Lord in neighborly love was illustrated above at <a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_1038/bible_king-james-version_genesis_6_18" target=_top>Genesis 6:18</a> and earlier in the present chapter, at verse <a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_1038/bible_king-james-version_genesis_9_9" target=_top>9</a> [<a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_1038/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_665" target=_top>665-666</a>, <a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_1038/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_1023" target=_top>1023</a>].<br />The fact that a pact is the presence of the Lord in love and charity is evident from the nature of a pact. Every covenant exists to tie people together; that is, the goal is for people to live in mutual friendship, or in a state of love. This is why marriage too is called a compact or covenant.<br />The Lord cannot unite with us except in love and charity, because the Lord is love itself and mercy; he wants to save us all and draw us to heaven — that is, to himself — with a powerful force. So we can all see and conclude that no one could ever be united to the Lord except through that which is the Lord, or in other words, without doing as he does, or making common cause with him. To do this is to love the Lord in return and to love our neighbor as ourselves. This is the only means of union. This is the most essential element of a compact. When union does grow out of it, then the Lord, of course, is present.<br />It is true that the Lord is actually present with every individual, but he is closer to or farther from us to the exact extent that we approach love or distance ourselves from it.<br />[2] Since a pact is the Lord's close connection with us through love or, to put it another way, is the presence of the Lord with us in love and charity, the Word calls the pact itself a pact of peace. This is because peace symbolizes the Lord's kingdom, and the Lord's kingdom consists of mutual love, which is the only thing that affords peace. In Isaiah, for instance:<br />"The mountains will withdraw and the hills recede, but my mercy will not withdraw from you, and my pact of peace will not recede," Jehovah has said, who shows you compassion. (<a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_1038/bible_king-james-version_isaiah_54_10" target=_top>Isaiah 54:10</a>)<br />Mercy, which is a matter of love, is being called a pact of peace. In Ezekiel:<br />I will raise up over them a single shepherd (and he will pasture them): my servant David. He will pasture them, and he will serve them as shepherd, and I will cut a pact of peace with them. (<a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_1038/bible_king-james-version_ezekiel_34_23" target=_top>Ezekiel 34:23</a>, <a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_1038/bible_king-james-version_ezekiel_34_25" target=_top>25</a>)<br />David obviously means the Lord, whose presence with a regenerate person is depicted in the words he will pasture them.<br />[3] In the same author:<br />My servant David will be monarch over them, and there will be a single shepherd for them all. And I will strike a pact of peace with them; it will be an eternal pact with them. And I will place them and make them multiply and put my sanctuary in their midst forever. And I will become their God, and they will become my people. (<a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_1038/bible_king-james-version_ezekiel_37_24" target=_top>Ezekiel 37:24</a>, <a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_1038/bible_king-james-version_ezekiel_37_26-27" target=_top>26-27</a>)<br />Again David means the Lord. The sanctuary in their midst means love. The statement that he would become their God and that they would become his people means the Lord's presence and unity with us in love, that presence and unity being called a pact of peace and an eternal pact. In Malachi:<br />"You will know that I have sent you this commandment: that my compact should be with Levi," Jehovah Sabaoth{*1} has said. "My compact with him was one of life and peace; and I gave them to him along with fear, and he will fear me." (<a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_1038/bible_king-james-version_malachi_2_4-5" target=_top>Malachi 2:4-5</a>)<br />In the highest sense, Levi is the Lord, and as a result he is any person who has love and charity. So the compact of life and peace with Levi involves love and charity.<br />[4] In Moses, where he is speaking of Phinehas:<br />Here, now, I am giving him my pact of peace, and for him and for his seed after him it will be a pact of eternal priesthood. (<a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_1038/bible_king-james-version_numbers_25_12-13" target=_top>Numbers 25:12-13</a>)<br />Phinehas does not mean Phinehas but the priesthood that he represented, which symbolizes love in all its aspects, just as the whole priesthood of that religion did. Everyone realizes that Phinehas's priesthood was not eternal. In the same author:<br />Jehovah your God, he is God, a faithful God, keeping his pact and his mercy with those who love him and keep his commandments, to the thousandth generation. (<a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_1038/bible_king-james-version_deuteronomy_7_9" target=_top>Deuteronomy 7:9</a>, <a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_1038/bible_king-james-version_deuteronomy_7_12" target=_top>12</a>)<br />The pact is quite explicitly the presence of the Lord with us in love, since the passage says it is with those who love him and keep his commandments.<br />[5] Since a pact is the Lord's close connection with us through love, it follows that it is also a connection through all the by-products of love, which consist of religious truth and are called commandments. All the commandments — and in fact the law and the prophets — are based on one solitary law, that we should love the Lord above all and our neighbor as ourselves. The Lord's words in <a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_1038/bible_king-james-version_matthew_22_35-40" target=_top>Matthew 22:35-40</a> and <a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_1038/bible_king-james-version_mark_12_28-34" target=_top>Mark 12:28-34</a> make this clear. So the tablets on which the Ten Commandments were written are called the tablets of the covenant [<a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_1038/bible_king-james-version_deuteronomy_9_9" target=_top>Deuteronomy 9:9</a>, <a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_1038/bible_king-james-version_deuteronomy_9_11" target=_top>11</a>, <a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_1038/bible_king-james-version_deuteronomy_9_15" target=_top>15</a>; <a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_1038/bible_king-james-version_hebrews_9_4" target=_top>Hebrews 9:4</a>].<br />Since a pact or a close bond is achieved through the laws of love, or the commandments, such a bond was also achieved through societal laws that the Lord laid down for the Jewish religion, which are called testimonies. It was achieved through the Lord's requirements for religious ritual — called statutes — as well. All these rules are described as part of the pact, because they look to love and kindness as their goal. As we read of King Josiah:<br />The king stood by the pillar and struck a pact before Jehovah, to walk after Jehovah and to keep his commandments and his testimonies and his statutes, with all his heart and with all his soul, to secure the words of the pact. (<a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_1038/bible_king-james-version_2-kings_23_3" target=_top>2 Kings 23:3</a>)<br />[6] These considerations now indicate what a pact is and show that it is an inward thing, since internal ties — never external ties separately from internal ones — are what bind us to the Lord. External practices are only tokens or representations of what lies inside. Our actions, for example, are tokens representing our thoughts and intentions, while the charitable deeds we do are tokens representing the love we cherish for our neighbor in heart and mind. In the same way, all the rituals of the Jewish religion foreshadowed and represented the Lord, and as a result they provided an image and representation of love and charity and all the effects of both. So it is our inner attributes that make the pact and the union possible; outward attributes are merely signs of the pact, and this is also what they are called.<br />The fact that inner attributes make the pact and the union possible is plain to see. In Jeremiah, for example:<br />"Look! The days are coming," says Jehovah, "when I will strike a new pact with the house of Israel and with the house of Judah unlike the pact that I struck with their ancestors, because they nullified my pact. But this is the pact that I will strike with the house of Israel after these days: I will put my law in the midst of them, and upon their heart I will write it." (<a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_1038/bible_king-james-version_jeremiah_31_31-32" target=_top>Jeremiah 31:31-32</a>, <a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_1038/bible_king-james-version_jeremiah_31_33" target=_top>33</a>)<br />This is about a new church. It says openly that the actual covenant itself depends on inner qualities and in fact on those present in a conscience that has written on it the law, which has entirely to do with love, as noted.<br />[7] External observances, again, are not the pact, unless deeper impulses are attached to them and consequently work together with them toward one and the same end, by being united to them. Externals are signs of the pact, rather, their purpose being to bring the Lord to mind as tokens representing him. Evidence for these things is the fact that the Sabbath and circumcision are called signs of the pact. The Sabbath is so designated in Moses:<br />The children of Israel shall keep the Sabbath, to make the Sabbath an eternal pact throughout their generations. This sign will exist forever between me and the children of Israel. (<a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_1038/bible_king-james-version_exodus_31_16-17" target=_top>Exodus 31:16-17</a>)<br />Circumcision receives the designation in the same author:<br />This is my pact, which you will keep, between me and you and your seed after you: that every male be circumcised to you. And you will circumcise the flesh of your foreskin, and it will serve as a sign of the pact between me and you. (<a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_1038/bible_king-james-version_genesis_17_10-11" target=_top>Genesis 17:10-11</a>)<br />Blood, for the same reason, is also called the blood of the covenant in <a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_1038/bible_king-james-version_exodus_24_7-8" target=_top>Exodus 24:7-8</a>.<br />[8] The main reason external rituals are called signs of the pact is that they serve to bring to mind inner attributes — that is, the entities they symbolize. None of the rituals of the Jewish religion had any other purpose. As a result, the aids they had to remind them of deeper realities were also called signs. An example is their practice of binding the first great commandment on their hand and in a box on their brow,{*2} as described in Moses:<br />You shall love Jehovah your God with all your heart and with all your soul and with all your powers. And you shall bind these words as a sign on your hand, and they shall be as brow pieces between your eyes. (<a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_1038/bible_king-james-version_deuteronomy_6_5" target=_top>Deuteronomy 6:5</a>, <a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_1038/bible_king-james-version_deuteronomy_6_8" target=_top>8</a>; <a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_1038/bible_king-james-version_deuteronomy_11_13" target=_top>11:13</a>, <a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_1038/bible_king-james-version_deuteronomy_11_18" target=_top>18</a>)<br />The hand symbolizes the will because it symbolizes strength, since strength belongs to the will. The brow pieces between the eyes symbolize the intellect. So the sign symbolizes remembering the first great commandment (which is the law in condensed form) in order to keep it constantly in the will and constantly in the thought. In other words, the goal is the presence of the Lord and of love in all our willing and all our thinking. This is how the Lord, and mutual love received from him, are present with angels. With the Lord's divine mercy, the nature of this continual presence will be discussed later [<a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_1038/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_1276" target=_top>1276-1277</a>, <a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_1038/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_6849" target=_top>6849</a>, <a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_1038/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_7926#subsection-2-2" target=_top>7926:2</a>, <a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_1038/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_9682" target=_top>9682</a>].<br />Likewise here, where it says, "This is the sign of the pact that I make between me and you: My bow I have put in the cloud, and it will serve as a sign of the pact between me and the earth." No other sign is meant here than one indicating the presence of the Lord in neighborly love, and consequently it symbolizes recollection on our part.<br />How this sign — the bow in the cloud — served as an indication and reminder, though, will be told below [<a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_1038/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_1042" target=_top>1042</a>], with the Lord's divine mercy.<br /><br /><strong>Footnotes:</strong><br />{*1} On the name Jehovah Sabaoth ("Jehovah of the Legions"), see note 1 in <a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_1038/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_119" target=_top>119</a>.

This is the sign of the covenant. That this signifies an indication of the presence of the Lord in charity, is evident from the signification of a "covenant" and of a "sign of a covenant." That a "covenant" 
signifies the presence of the Lord in charity, has been shown before (Gen. 6:18, and above in the present chapter, verse 9). That a "covenant" is the presence of the Lord in love and charity, 
is evident from the nature of a covenant. Every covenant is for the sake of conjunction, that is, for the sake of living in mutual friendship, or love. Marriage also is for this reason called a covenant. 
There is no conjunction of the Lord with man except in love and charity; for the Lord is love and mercy itself. He wills to save everyone and to draw him with mighty power to heaven, that is, to Himself. 
From this everyone may know and conclude that no one can ever be conjoined with the Lord except through that which He Himself is, that is, except by becoming like or making one with Him-in other 
words, by loving the Lord in return and loving the neighbor as himself. By this alone is the conjunction effected. This is the veriest essence of a covenant. When there is conjunction from this, it 
then follows manifestly that the Lord is present. There is indeed the very presence of the Lord with every man, but it is nearer or more remote exactly according to the approach to love or the distance 
from love.  [2] Because the "covenant" is the conjunction of the Lord with man by love, or what is the same, the presence of the Lord with man in love and charity, it is called in the Word the "covenant 
of peace;" for "peace" signifies the kingdom of the Lord, and the kingdom of the Lord consists in mutual love, in which alone is peace. As in Isaiah: </p>
<p>     For the mountains shall depart, and the 
hills be removed; but My mercy shall not depart from thee, neither shall My covenant of peace be removed, saith Jehovah that hath mercy on thee (Isa. 54:10), where mercy, which is of love, is called 
a "covenant of peace." In Ezekiel: </p>
<p>     I will raise up one shepherd over them, and he shall feed them, even My servant David; he shall feed them, and he shall be their shepherd; and I will make with 
them a covenant of peace (Ezek. 34:23, 25), where by "David" is plainly meant the Lord; and His presence with the regenerate man is described by His feeding" them.  [3] Again: </p>
<p>     My servant 
David shall be king over them; and there shall be to them all one shepherd, and I will make a covenant of peace with them; it shall be an everlasting covenant with them; and I will set them, and will 
cause them to multiply, and will put My sanctuary in the midst of them forevermore; and I will be their God, and they shall be My people (Ezek. 37:24, 26-27), where in like manner the Lord is meant by 
"David;" love, by "His sanctuary in the midst of them;" the presence and conjunction of the Lord in love, by "His being their God and by their being His people" which is called a "covenant of peace" 
and an "everlasting covenant." In Malachi: </p>
<p>     Ye shall know that I have sent this commandment unto you, that My covenant might be with Levi, saith Jehovah of armies; My covenant was with him of lives 
and peace; and I gave them to him in fear, and he shall fear Me (Mal. 2:4-5). "Levi" in the supreme sense is the Lord, and hence the man who has love and charity, and therefore the covenant of lives 
and peace with Levi is in love and charity.  [4] In Moses, speaking of Phinehas: </p>
<p>     Behold, I give unto him My covenant of peace; and it shall be unto him, and to his seed after him, the covenant 
of an eternal priesthood (Num. 25:12-13), where by "Phinehas" is not meant Phinehas, but the priesthood which was represented by him, which signifies love and what is of love, as does all the priesthood 
of that church. Everyone knows that Phinehas did not have an eternal priesthood. Again: </p>
<p>     Jehovah thy God, He is God; the faithful God, who keepeth covenant and mercy with them that love Him 
and keep His commandments, to the thousandth generation (Deut. 7:9, 12),  where it is plain that the presence of the Lord with man in love is the "covenant" for it is said that He keepeth it with 
them that love Him and keep His commandments.  [5] Since a "covenant" is the conjunction of the Lord with man by love, it follows that it is also by all things that pertain to love, which are the truths 
of faith, and are called precepts; for all precepts, indeed the Law and the Prophets, are founded on the one Law, to love the Lord above all things and the neighbor as oneself, as is evident from 
the words of the Lord (Matt. 22:34-40; Mark 12:28-34). And therefore the tables on which were written the ten commandments, are called the "Tables of the Covenant." Since a covenant, or conjunction, is 
effected through the laws or precepts of love, it was effected also through the laws of society given by the Lord in the Jewish Church, which are called "testimonies;" and also through the rites of 
the church enjoined by the Lord, called "statutes." All these things are said to be of the "covenant" because they regard love and charity, as we read of Josiah the king: </p>
<p>     The king stood upon the 
pillar, and made a covenant before Jehovah, to walk after Jehovah, and to keep His commandments, and His testimonies, and His statutes, with all the heart and with all the soul, to establish the words 
of this covenant (2 Kings 23:3). [6] From these things it is now evident what a "covenant" is, and that the covenant is internal; for the conjunction of the Lord with man takes place by what is internal, 
and never by what is external separate from what is internal. External things are only types and representatives of internal, as the action of a man is a type representative of his thought and 
will; and as the work of charity is a type representative of the charity which is within, in the heart and mind. So all the rites of the Jewish Church were types representative of the Lord, consequently 
of love and charity, and of all things therefrom. Wherefore it is through the internals of man that a covenant and conjunction is made, and externals are only signs of the covenant, as indeed they 
are called. That a covenant and conjunction is made through internals is plainly evident, as in Jeremiah: </p>
<p>     Behold, the days come, saith Jehovah, that I will make a new covenant with the house of 
Israel, and with the house of Judah; not according to the covenant that I made with their fathers, forasmuch as they made vain My covenant but this is the covenant that I will make with the house of Israel 
after these days, saith Jehovah; I will put My law in their inward parts and write it on their heart (Jer. 31:31-33), where a new church is treated of. It is clearly stated that the veriest covenant 
is through the internals, and indeed in conscience on which the Law is inscribed, all of which is of love, as has been said.  [7] That external things are not the "covenant" unless internal things 
are adjoined to them, and thus by union act as one and the same cause; but are only "signs" of the covenant by means of which as by representative types the Lord might be kept in remembrance, is evident 
from the fact that the Sabbath and circumcision are called "signs" of the covenant. That the Sabbath is so called, we read in Moses: </p>
<p>     The sons of Israel shall keep the Sabbath, to observe 
the Sabbath throughout their generations, for a perpetual covenant; it is a sign between Me and the sons of Israel eternally (Exod. 31:16-17). And that circumcision also is so called, in the same: </p>
<p> 
    This is My covenant, which ye shall keep, between Me and you and thy seed after thee; that every male be circumcised unto you; and ye shall circumcise the flesh of your foreskin; and it shall be for 
a sign of a covenant between Me and you (Gen. 17:10-11). Hence also blood is called the "blood of the covenant" (Exod. 24:7-8).  [8] External rites are called "signs of a covenant" for the reason 
chiefly that interior things may be kept in mind by them, that is, the things signified by them. All the rites of the Jewish Church were nothing else. And for this reason they were also called "signs" 
that the people might be reminded by them of interior things-as for instance, the binding of the chief commandment on the hand and on the forehead, as in Moses: </p>
<p>     Thou shalt love Jehovah thy God 
with all thy heart, and with all thy soul, and with all thy might; and these words thou shalt bind for a sign upon thy hand, and they shall be for frontlets between thine eyes (Deut. 6:5, 8; 11:13, 18). Here 
"hand" signifies the will because it signifies power, for power is of the will; "frontlets between the eyes" signify the understanding; thus the "sign" signifies remembrance of the chief commandment, 
or of the Law in sum, that it may be continually in the will and in the thought, that is, that the presence of the Lord and of love may be in all the will and in all the thought. Such is the 
presence of the Lord and of mutual love from Him with the angels, which continual presence will be further described, by the Divine mercy of the Lord, hereafter. In like manner, in the present verse 
its being said: "This is the sign of the covenant which I make between Me and you: I have set My bow in the cloud, and it shall be for a sign of a covenant between Me and the earth" signifies no other 
sign than an indication of the presence of the Lord in charity, thus the remembrance of Him in man. But how there is thence, or from the bow in the cloud, a sign and remembrance, will be told, of the 
Lord's Divine mercy, in what follows. </p>

<p align="center"><b>Elliott(1983-1999) 1038</b></p><p><b>1038.</b>
That 'this is the sign of the covenant' means a token of the Lord's presence in charity is clear from the meaning of 'a covenant' and of 'the sign of a covenant'. That the covenant means the Lord's presence 
in charity has been shown already at Chapter 6:18, and above at verse 9 of the present chapter; and that a covenant is the Lord's presence in love and charity is clear from the very nature of 
a covenant. The purpose of any covenant is conjunction, that is to say, its purpose is that people may live together in friendship or in love. This also is why marriage is called a covenant. The Lord's 
conjunction with man does not exist except in love and charity, for the Lord is love itself and mercy. He wills to save everyone and by His mighty power to draw them towards heaven, that is, towards 
Himself. From this anyone may know and conclude that it is impossible for anybody to be joined to the Lord except by means of that which He Himself is, that is, except by acting like Him, or becoming 
one with Him - that is to say, by loving the Lord in return, and loving the neighbour as oneself. In this way alone is conjunction brought about; this constitutes the very essence of a covenant. When 
conjunction results from this, it quite plainly follows that the Lord is present. The Lord is indeed present with each individual, but that presence is closer or more remote, all depending on how near 
the person is to love or distant from it. </p>
<p></p>
<p><b>[2]</b>
 Since 'the covenant' is the conjunction of the Lord with man by means of love, or what amounts to the same, the Lord's presence with man in love and 
charity, the covenant itself is called in the Word 'a covenant of peace', for 'peace' means the Lord's kingdom, and the Lord's kingdom consists in mutual love, in which alone peace resides, as is said 
in Isaiah,  </p>
<p>The mountains will depart and the hills be removed, but My mercy will not depart from you, and the covenant of My peace will not be removed, said Jehovah, the One who takes pity on you. 
Isa. 54:10.  Here mercy, which is an attribute of love, is called 'a covenant of peace'. In Ezekiel, </p>
<p>I will raise up over them one shepherd, and He will pasture them - My servant David. He will 
pasture them and He will be a shepherd to them. And I will make with them a covenant of peace. Ezek. 34:23, <a href="25.htm">25</a>. </p>
<p>Here 'David' is plainly used to mean the Lord, and His presence with a regenerate person 
is described by the words 'He will pasture them'.  </p>
<p></p>
<p><b>[3]</b>
 In the same prophet, </p>
<p>My servant David will be king over them, and they will all have one shepherd. And I will make with them a covenant 
of peace; it will be an eternal covenant with them. And I will bless<A name="fntext1"></a><A href="#fn1"><sup>a</sup></a> them and cause them to multiply, and I will set My sanctuary in their midst for evermore. And I will be their God and they will be 
My people. Ezek. 37:14, <a href="16.htm">16</a>, <a href="17.htm">17</a>. </p>
<p>Here similarly the Lord is meant by David. Love is meant by the 'sanctuary in their midst', the Lord's presence and conjunction in love by the promise that 'He will 
be their God, and they will be His people', which is called 'a covenant of peace' and 'an eternal covenant'. In Malachi, </p>
<p>You will know that I have sent this command to you, that it may be My covenant 
with Levi, said Jehovah Zebaoth. My covenant was with him, [a covenant] of life<A name="fntext2"></a><A href="#fn2"><sup>b</sup></a> and peace, and I have given them to him in fear, and he will fear Me. Mal. 2:4, <a href="5.htm">5</a>.  </p>
<p>In the highest sense 'Levi' 
means the Lord, and from this the person who has love and charity; and this being so 'a covenant of life' and peace with Levi' means in love and charity. </p>
<p></p>
<p><b>[4]</b>
 In Moses, in reference to Phinehas, </p>
<p>Behold, 
I am giving to him My covenant of peace, and it will be to him and his seed after him a covenant of eternal priesthood. Num. 25:12, <a href="13.htm">13</a>.  </p>
<p>Here 'Phinehas' is not used to mean Phinehas but the 
priesthood which he represented and which means love and what belongs to love, as does the entire priesthood of that Church. Everyone knows that the priesthood did not remain with Phinehas for ever. 
In the same author,  </p>
<p>Jehovah your God is God Himself, a faithful God who keeps a covenant and mercy with those who love Him, and who keep His commandments, to the thousandth generation. Deut. 7:9, <a href="12.htm">12</a>. </p>
<p>Here the Lord's presence with man in love is clearly meant by 'the covenant', for it is said to be 'with those who love Him and keep His commandments'. </p>
<p></p>
<p><b>[5]</b>
 because the covenant is the conjunction 
of the Lord with man by means of love, it follows that it is also achieved by means of all the things allied to love, which are the truths of faith and are called commandments. For all the commandments, 
indeed the Law and the Prophets, are based on that single law that men ought to love the Lord above all things and the neighbour as themselves. This is clear from the Lord's words in Matt. 
22:35-40; Mark 12:28-34. This is also why the tablets on which the Ten Commandments were written are called 'the tablets of the covenant'. Since a covenant or conjunction is achieved by means of the laws 
or commandments of love it was also achieved by means of the social laws introduced by the Lord into the Jewish Church, which are called 'testimonies', as well as by the religious observances commanded 
by the Lord, which are called 'statutes'. All of these are called [laws] of the covenant because they have regard to love and charity. As is said of King Josiah, </p>
<p>The king stood upon the pillar, 
and made a covenant before Jehovah, to walk after Jehovah, and to keep His commandments, and His testimonies, and His statutes, with all his heart, and all his soul, to establish the words of the covenant. 
<a href="1.htm">1</a> Kings 23:7. </p>
<p></p>
<p><b>[6]</b>
 From these references it is now clear what a covenant is, and that the covenant is internal, for the conjunction of the Lord with man is achieved by means of internal things, 
and never by means of external things separated from internal. External things are merely images and representatives of those that are internal, as the action of a person is an image representative 
of his thought and will, and as a charitable act is an image representative of charity present within, in intention and mind. Thus all the religious observances of the Jewish Church were images representative 
of the Lord, and so of love and charity, and of all things deriving from these. It is by means of the internal things of a person therefore that the covenant or conjunction is achieved. External 
things are no more than signs of the covenant, which also is what they are called. That internal things are the means by which the covenant or conjunction is achieved is quite clear, as in Jeremiah, </p>
<p>Behold, 
the days are coming, says Jehovah, when I will make with the house of Israel and with the house of Judah a new covenant, not like the covenant which I made with their fathers, for they 
rendered My covenant invalid. But this is the covenant which I will make with the house of Israel after those days: I will put My law in the midst of them and will write it on their hearts. Jer. 31:31-33. </p>
<p>This 
refers to a new Church. It is plainly stated that the covenant itself is achieved by means of internal things, and indeed within conscience on which the Law is written, the whole of which 
Law, as stated, is that of love. </p>
<p></p>
<p><b>[7]</b>
 That external things do not constitute the covenant unless internal things are joined to them and so through that union act as one and the same cause, but are 
merely 'signs of the covenant' by means of which, as by representative images, the Lord might be called to mind, is clear from the fact that the sabbath and circumcision are called 'signs' of the covenant. 
That the sabbath is so called is clear in Moses, </p>
<p>The children of Israel shall keep the sabbath, observing the sabbath throughout their generations, an eternal covenant. Between Me and the children 
of Israel this is a sign eternally. Exod. 31:16, <a href="17.htm">17</a>. </p>
<p>And that circumcision is called 'a sign of the covenant' is clear in the same author, </p>
<p>This is My covenant which you shall keep between 
Me and you and your seed after you. Every male among you is to be circumcised. And you shall circumcise the flesh of your foreskin, and it will be a sign of the covenant between Me and you. Gen. 17:10, 
<a href="11.htm">11</a>. </p>
<p>For the same reason also blood is called 'the blood of the covenant', Exod. 24:7, <a href="8.htm">8</a>. </p>
<p></p>
<p><b>[8]</b>
 The chief reason why external religious ceremonies were called signs of the covenant was so that 
from them people might call interior things to mind, that is, the things meant by them. All the religious observances of the Jewish Church were nothing else. For this reason they were also called signs 
that would serve to remind the people of interior things - for example, the practice of binding the chief commandment on the hand and of wearing frontlets, as stated in Moses, </p>
<p>You shall love Jehovah 
your God with all your heart, and with all your soul, and with all your strength. And you shall bind these words as n sign upon your hand, and they shall be as frontlets between your eyes. Deut. 6:5, 
<a href="8.htm">8</a>; 11:13, <a href="18.htm">18</a>. </p>
<p>Because it means power 'the hand' here means the will, for power is an attribute of the will; while 'frontlets between the eyes' means the understanding. Thus 'a sign' means calling 
to mind the chief commandment, or epitome of the Law, that it may be constantly in the will and constantly in the thought, that is, that the Lord and love may be present within the whole will and the 
whole thought. Such is the presence of the Lord and from Him of mutual love existing with angels. That constant presence and the nature of it will in the Lord's Divine mercy be discussed later on. 
And in like manner here the statement, 'This is the sign of the covenant which I give between Me and you; I have given My bow in the cloud, and it will be for a sign of the covenant', means no other sign 
than a token of the Lord's presence in charity, and so man's remembrance of Him. But in what way the bow in the cloud provides that token and so remembrance will in the Lord's Divine mercy be discussed 
later on.

'Hoc signum foederis': quod significet indicium praesentiae Domini in charitate, constat a significatione 'foederis et signi foederis'; quod foedus significet praesentiam Domini in charitate, ostensum 
est prius cap. vi 18, et supra in hoc capite ad vers. 9.  Quod foedus sit praesentia Domini in amore et charitate, constat a natura foederis; omne foedus est conjunctionis causa, ut nempe mutuo vivant 
in amicitia aut in amore; conjugium inde quoque appellatur foedus: conjunctio Domini cum homine non datur nisi in amore et charitate, nam Dominus est Ipse amor, et misericordia; unumquemvis salvare 
vult, et vi forti ad caelum, hoc est, ad se attrahere; inde quisque scire et concludere potest quod nusquam aliquis conjungi possit cum Domino nisi per illud quod Ipse est, hoc est, nisi simile faciat, 
aut unum faciat cum Ipso, hoc est, ut (x)redamet Dominum, et amet proximum sicut se; per haec solum fit conjunctio; haec est ipsissima essentia foederis; quando conjunctio inde, tunc sequitur manifeste 
quod Dominus praesens sit: ipsa praesentia Domini est quidem apud omnem hominem sed est propior et remotior, prorsus secundum gradus ad amorem et distantiam ab amore.  [2] Quia foedus est conjunctio 
Domini cum homine per amorem, seu quod idem est, est praesentia Domini apud hominem in amore et charitate, ipsum foedus appellatur in Verbo 'foedus pacis,' nam 'pax' significat regnum Domini, et 
regnum Domini consistit in amore mutuo, in quo solo est pax; ut apud Esaiam, 	Montes recedent et colles dimovebuntur, et misericordia Mea a tecum non recedet, et foedus pacis Meae non dimovebitur, dixit 
Miserator tuus Jehovah, liv 10; </p>
<p>ubi misericordia, quae est amoris, dicitur 'foedus pacis': apud Ezechielem, 	Suscitabo super illos pastorem unum, et pascet illos, servum Meum Davidem; Hic pascet 
eos, et Hic erit illis in pastorem,... et excidam illis foedus pacis, xxxiv 23, 25; </p>
<p>ubi per 'Davidem' manifeste intelligitur Dominus; Ipsius praesentia apud hominem regeneratum describitur per 'quod 
pascet eos': [3] apud eundem, 	Servus Meus David, rex super illos, et pastor unus erit omnibus illis;... et pangam illis foedus pacis, foedus aeternitatis erit cum illis; et dabo illos, et multiplicari 
	faciam illos, et ponam sanctuarium Meum in medio illorum in aeternum;... et ero illis in Deum, et illi erunt Mihi in populum, xxxvii 24, 26, 27; </p>
<p>ubi similiter Dominus per 'Davidem' intelligitur; 
amor per 'sanctuarium in medio illorum,' praesentia et conjunctio Domini in amore per quod 'erit illis in Deum,' et illi erunt Ipsi in populum,' quae appellatur 'foedus pacis, et foedus aeternitatis': 
apud Malachiam, 	Cognoscetis quod miserim ad vos praeceptum hoc, ut sit foedus Meum cum Levi, dixit Jehovah Zebaoth, foedus Meum fuit cum illo, vitarum et pacis, et dedi illa illi timore, et timebit 
Me, ii 4, 5; </p>
<p>'Levi' in supremo sensu est Dominus, et inde homo cui amor et charitas, quare 'foedus vitarum et pacis cum Levi' est in amore et charitate: apud Mosen ubi de Pinhaso, [4]	Ecce Ego dans 
illi foedus Meum pacis, et erit illi et semini illius post illum foedus sacerdotii aeterni, Num. xxv 12, 13; </p>
<p>ubi per 'Pinhasum' non intelligitur Pinhasus sed sacerdotium quod per eum repraesentabatur, 
quod significat amorem et quae amoris sunt, sicut omne sacerdotium istius Ecclesiae; quisque novit quod Pinhaso non fuit sacerdotium aeternum: apud eundem, 	Jehovah Deus tuus, Ipse Deus, Deus fidelis, 
custodiens foedus et misericordiam amantibus Ipsum, et custodientibus praecepta Ipsius, millesimae generationi, Deut. vii 9, 12; </p>
<p>ubi manifeste, quod praesentia Domini apud hominem in amore sit 
'foedus,' nam dicitur quod sit 'amantibus Ipsum, et custodientibus praecepta.' [5] Quia foedus est conjunctio Domini cum homine per amorem, sequitur quod quoque sit per omnia quae sunt amoris, quae sunt 
vera fidei et appellantur praecepta; omnia enim praecepta, immo Lex et Prophetae, fundantur in unica lege ut ament Dominum supra omnia et proximum sicut semet, ut constat a Domini verbis, Matth. xxii 
34-39, Marc. xii 28-35, quare etiam tabulae super quibus decem praecepta scripta sunt, appellantur 'tabulae foederis': quia foedus aut conjunctio est per amoris leges seu praecepta, etiam fuit per 
leges societatis in Ecclesia Judaica latas a Domino quae vocantur 'testimonia'; tum quoque per ritus Ecclesiae a Domino mandatos qui vocantur 'statuta'; omnia haec vocantur foederis quia spectant amorem 
et charitatem: sicut legitur de Joshia rege, 	Stetit rex super columna {1}, et pepigit foedus coram Jehovah, ad eundum post Jehovam, et ad custodiendum praecepta Ipsius, et testimonia Ipsius, et statuta 
Ipsius ex toto corde, et ex tota anima, ad stabiliendum verba foederis, 2 Reg. xxiii 3. [6]	Ex his nunc constat quid est foedus, et quod foedus sit internum, nam conjunctio Domini cum homine fit 
per interna, nusquam per externa separata ab internis; externa sunt modo typi et repraesentativa internorum, sicut actio hominis est typus repraesentativus ejus cogitationis et voluntatis, et sicut 
opus charitatis est typus repraesentativus charitatis quae intus in animo et mente; ita omnes ritus Ecclesiae Judaicae erant typi repraesentativi Domini, proinde amoris et charitatis et omnium quae inde; 
quare per interna hominis fit foedus et conjunctio; externa sunt modo signa foederis, sicut etiam appellantur; quod per interna fiat foedus aut conjunctio, constat manifeste; ut apud Jeremiam, 	Ecce 
dies venientes, dictum Jehovae, et pangam cum domo Israelis, et cum domo Jehudae, foedus novum, non sicut foedus quod pepigi cum patribus eorum,.... quia ii irritum reddiderunt foedus Meum;... sed 
hoc foedus quod pangam cum domo Israelis post dies hos,... dabo legem Meam in medio 	eorum, et super cor eorum scribam illam, xxxi 31-33; </p>
<p>ubi de nova Ecclesia; clare dicitur quod ipsissimum foedus 
sit per interna, et quidem in conscientia cui inscribitur lex, quae omnis est amoris, ut dictum.  [7] Quod externa non sint foedus nisi iis interna adjuncta sint, et sic unam eandemque causam per unionem 
agant, sed quod sint 'signa foederis,' ut per illa sicut per typos repraesentativos recordarentur Domini, constat ex eo quod sabbatum et circumcisio vocentur 'signa foederis'; quod sabbatum, apud 
Mosen, 	Custodient filii Israelis sabbatum, ad faciendum sabbatum, in generationes suas, foedus aeternum; inter Me et inter filios Israelis signum hoc in aeternum, Exod. xxxi 16, 17; </p>
<p>et quod circumcisio, 
apud eundem, 	Hoc foedus Meum, quod custodietis inter Me et inter vos, et inter semen tuum post te; circumcidi vobis omnem masculum: et circumcidetis carnem praeputii vestri, et erit in signum 
foederis inter Me et inter vos, Gen. xvii 10, 11. Sanguis inde quoque appellatur 'sanguis foederis', Exod. xxiv 7, 8.  [8] Externi ritus cumprimis inde dicti sunt signa foederis ut ex illis recordarentur 
interiorum, hoc est, illarum rerum quas significabant; omnes ritus Ecclesiae Judaicae non aliud erant; quare etiam illa appellabantur signa, quae suppeditarent illis recordationem interiorum, sicut 
quod primarium praeceptum alligarent super manu et ad frontalia, ut apud Mosen, 	Amabis Jehovam Deum tuum, ex toto corde tuo, et ex tota anima tua, et ex omnibus viribus tuis:... et alligabis haec 
verba in signum super manu tua, et erunt in frontalia inter oculos tuos, Deut. vi 5, 8; xi 13, 18; </p>
<p>ubi 'manus' significat voluntatem quia potentiam, nam potentia est voluntatis, 'frontalia inter oculos' 
(x)significant intellectum, ita signum recordationem primarii praecepti, seu legis in summa, ut continue sit in voluntate et continue in cogitatione, hoc est, ut sit praesentia Domini et amoris in 
omni voluntate et in omni cogitatione; talis est praesentia Domini et ab Ipso amoris mutui apud angelos, de qua continua praesentia, qualis sit, ex Divina Domini Misericordia, in sequentibus dicetur. 
Similiter hic, quod dicatur 'hoc signum foederis, quod ego do inter Me et inter vos, arcum Meum dedi in nube, et erit in signum foederis inter Me et inter terram' significat signum non aliud quam indicium 
praesentiae Domini in charitate, ita recordationem apud hominem: sed quomodo inde, seu ex arcu in nube, indicium et recordatio, in sequentibus, ex Divina Domini Misericordia, dicetur. 	@1 Heb.
