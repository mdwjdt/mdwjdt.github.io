<h3 align="center" class="ired">属天的奥秘 第10694节</h3>
<h4 align="center"></h4><p><strong>10694</strong>.“就怕挨近他”表他们无法忍受像这样的一个教会、敬拜和圣言的外在形式。这从“怕挨近”的含义和“摩西”的代表清楚可知：“怕挨近”是指不能忍受，因为那些不能承认内层事物的人害怕靠近它们；“摩西”是指含有内在之物的圣言、教会和敬拜所取的外在形式（<a href="10563.htm">10563</a>，<a href="10571.htm">10571</a>，<a href="10607.htm">10607</a>，<a href="10614.htm">10614</a>节）。此处的情形是这样：那些兴趣只在于没有内在事物的教会、敬拜和圣言的外在事物的人无法忍受内层事物。原因在于，那些兴趣在于没有内在之物的外在事物的人陷入了对自我的爱和对世界的爱，由此在一种被称为属世之光的劣质之光中观看。但那些兴趣在于教会、敬拜和圣言的外在事物，同时也在于它们的内在事物的人则处于对邻之爱和对主之爱，由此在天堂之光中观看。由于这两种爱是对立的，所以这两种光也是对立的，一个无法忍受另一个。事实上，当天堂之爱，也就是对主之爱和对邻之爱流入世俗之爱，也就是对自我的爱和对世界的爱时，它会引起像死亡那样的巨痛；当天堂的光流入世界的光时，它会造成幽暗，由此造成愚蠢。正因如此，没有内在之物的外在形式无法忍受含有内在之物在里面的任何外在形式。由于以色列民族就是这样，所以他们无法忍受听见主，听见对祂的爱和信，它们都是圣言、教会和敬拜的内层事物。这些就是以色列人因摩西面皮发光而害怕挨近他所表示的事。至于“摩西的面皮”表示什么，可参看前文（<a href="10691.htm">10691</a>节）。</p>

And they feared to come near unto him. That this signifies that they could not endure the external of the church, of worship, and of the Word when it was of this nature, is evident from the signification 
of "fearing to come near," as being not to endure, for those who cannot endure interior things are afraid to come near; and from the representation of Moses, as being that external of the Word, of 
the church, and of worship in which is the internal (n. 10563, 10571, 10607, 10614). The case herein is this. Those who are only in the externals of the church, of worship, and of the Word without the 
internal cannot endure interior things. The reason is that those who are in external things without what is internal are in the love of self and of the world; and from this are in a light which is 
called natural light. But those who are in the externals and at the same time in the internals of the church, of worship, and of the Word are in love toward the neighbor and in love to the Lord, and from 
this are in the light of heaven. As these loves are opposites, and consequently the lights also, therefore the one cannot endure the other; for when heavenly love (which is love to the Lord and love 
toward the neighbor) inflows into earthly loves (which are the loves of self and of the world), it induces agonies like those of death; and when heavenly light inflows into the light of the world, 
it induces thick darkness and a consequent stupor. From this it is that what is external without what is internal cannot endure the external while the internal is in it. As the Jewish nation was of this 
character, they could not endure to hear of the Lord, of love to Him, and of faith in Him, which are the interior things of the Word, of the church, and of worship. These then are the things which 
are signified by the sons of Israel fearing to come near unto Moses, because the skin of his faces shone. (What is signified by "the skin of Moses' faces" may be seen in n. 10691.) </p>

'And they were afraid to approach him' means that they could not bear an outward form of the Church, worship, and the Word such as this. This is clear from the meaning of 'being afraid to approach' as 
not being able to bear something, for those who cannot bear interior things are afraid to approach them; and from the representation of 'Moses' as the outward form that the Word, the Church, and worship 
take, containing what is inward, dealt with in <a href="10563.htm">10563</a>, <a href="10571.htm">10571</a>, <a href="10607.htm">10607</a>, <a href="10614.htm">10614</a>. The situation in all this is that those whose interest lies solely in things of the Church, worship, and the Word on an 
outward level devoid of what is inward cannot bear interior things. The reason for this is that those whose interest lies in outward things devoid of what is inward are ruled by selfish and worldly love, 
and consequently see by an inferior light, called natural illumination. But those whose interest lies in things of the Church, worship, and the Word on an inward level as well as those on an outward 
one are governed by love towards the neighbour and love to the Lord, and consequently see by the light of heaven. And since the two kinds of love are opposites, and consequently the two kinds of light 
are as well, one cannot bear the other. For when heavenly love, that is, love to the Lord and love towards the neighbour, flows into earthly loves, which are self-love and love of the world, it induces 
feelings of agony like the throes of death; and when heavenly light flows into worldly light, it induces thick darkness and consequently stupidity. So it is that an outward form devoid of inward 
content cannot bear any outward form when it does have an inner content. Since the Jewish nation was like this they could not bear to hear about the Lord, or about love and faith in Him, which are the 
interior things of the Word, the Church, and worship. These then are the things which are meant when it says that the children of Israel were afraid to approach Moses because the skin of his face gleamed. 
What it is that 'the skin of Moses' face' means, see above in <a href="10691.htm">10691</a>.  </p>

`Et timebant ab accedere ad illum':  quod significet quod non sustinerent externum Ecclesiae, cultus, et Verbi, cum tale, constat ex significatione `timere ab accedere' quod sit non sustinere, nam qui 
non sustinent interiora, illi timent accedere; et ex repraesentatione `Moschis' quod sit externum Verbi, Ecclesiae, et cultus, in quo internum, de qua n. 10563, 10571, 10607, 10614.  Cum hoc ita se 
habet:  qui modo in externis Ecclesiae, cultus, et Verbi sunt absque interno, non sustinent interiora; causa est quia qui in externis sunt absque {1}interno, in amore sui {2}et mundi sunt, et inde in 
lumine, quod lumen naturale vocatur; qui autem in externis sunt et simul in internis Ecclesiae, cultus, et Verbi sunt, in amore erga proximum et in amore in Dominum sunt, ac inde in luce caeli; {3}amores 
illi quia sunt oppositi, et inde quoque luces, ideo non sustinet unum alterum, nam amor caelestis, qui est amor in Dominum et amor erga proximum, cum influunt in amores terrestres, qui sunt amores 
sui et mundi, inducunt angores sicut mortis, et cum lux caelestis influit in lucem mundi, inducit caliginem et inde stuporem; inde est quod externum absque interno non sustineat externum {4}dum in eo 
est internum.  Quia {5}gens Judaica talis fuit, ideo non sustinuit audire de Domino, de amore et fide in Ipsum, quae sunt interiora Verbi, Ecclesiae, et cultus.  Haec nunc sunt quae significantur per 
quod filii Israelis timerent ab accedere ad Moschen, quia coruscavit cutis facierum ejus; {6}quid `cutis facierum Moschis,' videatur supra n. 10691. @1 internis$ @2 sunt ac in amore mundi$ @3 amores
