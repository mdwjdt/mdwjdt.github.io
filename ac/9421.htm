<h3 align="center" class="ired">属天的奥秘 第9421节</h3>
<h4 align="center"></h4><p><strong>9421.</strong>“摩西对长老说”表那些唯独局限于外在意义的人。这从“长老”的含义清楚可知，“长老”是指那些唯独局限于外在意义的人。以色列百姓中的长老在此之所以代表那些局限于外在意义的人，是因为他们是百姓的头领，因而代表整个百姓。而这百姓就局限于没有内在意义的外在意义，这一点在前面已经频繁说明。因为当摩西上山时，他代表圣言的外在圣洁，也就是它的内在圣洁和属于外在意义的代表之间的媒介或媒介（参看<a href="9414.htm">9414</a>，<a href="9419.htm">9419</a>节）。由此可推知，坐在山下，从而与摩西分离的“长老”代表唯独外在意义；因为摩西对他们说：“你们坐在这里等我们，直到我们再回到你们这里”。</p>

And he said unto the elders. That this signifies those who are in the external sense alone, is evident from the signification of "the elders," as being those who are in the external sense alone. That 
the elders of the Israelitish people here represent these, is because they were the heads of the people, and, so represented the whole people. That these were in the external sense of the Word without 
the internal, has been often shown above. For when Moses went up to the mountain, he represented the holy external of the Word, which is intermediate, or a medium, between its holy internal and the 
representative which is of the external sense (see n. 9414, 9419). Hence it follows that the elders who were seated beneath the mountain, and thus separated from Moses, represented the external sense 
alone; for Moses said unto them, "Sit ye here for us, until we return unto you." </p>

'And he said to the elders' means those restricted to the outward sense alone. This is clear from the meaning of 'the elders' as those restricted to the outward sense alone. The reason why 'the elders' 
of the Israelite people represent here those restricted to that sense is that the elders were the heads of the people and as such represented the whole people, who were restricted to the outward sense 
of the Word, without the inward, as has already been shown rather often. For when Moses went up into the mountain he represented the outward holiness of the Word, which is the intermediary or that 
which is positioned between its inward holiness and the representative which belongs to the outward sense, <a href="9414.htm">9414</a>, <a href="9419.htm">9419</a>. From this it follows that 'the elders' who were to sit beneath the mountain, and 
so were separated from Moses, represented the outward sense alone; for Moses told them, 'Sit for us in this [place], until we return to you'.  </p>

`Et ad seniores dixit': quod significet illos qui in solo sensu externo, constat ex significatione `seniorum' quod sint qui: in solo sensu externo; quod `seniores' populi Israelitici illos hic repraesentent, 
est quia capita populi erant, et sic repraesentabant omnem populum, qui quod in sensu Verbi externo absque interno esset, saepius prius ostensum est; Moscheh enim cum ascendebat ad montem, repraesentabat 
sanctum Verbi externum, quod est intermedium seu {1}medium inter sanctum ejus internum et inter repraesentativum quod est sensus externi, n. 9414, 9419; inde sequitur quod `seniores' qui 
sederent infra montem, ita separati a Moscheh repraesentarent solum sensum externum, dixit enim illis Moscheh `Sedete nobis in hoc, donec revertamur ad vos.' @1 medians$ </p>
