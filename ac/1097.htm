<h4 align="center"></h4><p><strong>1097.</strong>“迦南要作他的奴隶”表诸如使敬拜纯由外在构成之类的人就在那些为教会成员履行最低劣服务的人之列。这一点尤其从犹太教会中的代表清楚看出来。在犹太教会，犹大和以色列代表内在教会，其中，犹大代表属天教会，以色列代表属灵教会；而雅各则代表外在教会。然而，那些使敬拜纯由外在构成之人则由外邦人来代表，也就是他们所称呼的外族人。后者要作“他们的奴隶”，在教会履行最低劣的服务，如以赛亚书：<br />外人必起来牧放你们的羊群，外族人必作你们耕种田地的、修理葡萄园的；你们倒要称为耶和华的祭司，人必称你们为我们神的仆役。你们必吃用列国的财物，因得他们的荣耀而夸耀。（以赛亚书<a href="http://39-27.cn/赛61.5.htm">61:5</a>-<a href="http://39-27.cn/赛61.6.htm">6</a>）<br />此处属天之人被称为“耶和华的祭司”，属灵之人被称为“神的仆役”，而那些使敬拜纯由外在构成之人则被称为要在田地和葡萄园里服务的“外族人”。<br />同一先知书：<br />外族人必建筑你的城墙，他们的王必服事你。（以赛亚书<a href="http://39-27.cn/赛60.10.htm">60:10</a>）<br />此处同样提到他们的服务。约书亚记论到基遍人说：<br />你们是被咒诅的，你们中间的人必断不了作奴仆，为我神的殿作劈柴挑水的人。当日，约书亚使他们为会众和耶和华的坛作劈柴挑水的人。（约书亚记<a href="http://39-27.cn/书9.23.htm">9:23</a>，<a href="http://39-27.cn/书9.27.htm">27</a>）<br />根据与他们所立的约，从别处也能看出基遍人代表谁，尽管他们在那些在教会要作奴仆的人之列。关于外族人，律法规定，他们若接受和睦，开了城门，就当效劳服侍（申命记<a href="http://39-27.cn/申20.11.htm">20:11</a>；列王记上<a href="http://39-27.cn/王上9.21.htm">9:21</a>-<a href="http://39-27.cn/王上9.22.htm">22</a>）。圣言中所写的有关犹太教会的每一个细节都代表主的国。主的国具有这样的性质，即无论是谁，或无论是哪种人，都必须发挥某种作用。在祂的国中，主只关注功用。甚至地狱里的人也必须发挥某种作用，不过，他们所发挥的作用是最低劣的。在来生，那些只拥有脱离内在的外在敬拜之人就在那些发挥低劣作用的人之列。<br />此外，犹太教会中的代表具有这样的性质，要关注的对象不是去代表的这个人，而是他所代表之物。例如，犹太人绝不是属天之人，而是代表属天之人；再如，以色列绝不是一个属灵之人，而是代表一个属灵之人，雅各和其他人也一样。列王和祭司的情形也一样，他们代表主的王权和神圣。这一点从无生命之物也能行使代表作用的事实看得更清楚，如亚伦的衣服，祭坛本身，摆放食物的桌子，灯，饼和酒，此外还有公牛，小公牛，山羊，绵羊，小山羊，羔羊，鸽子和斑鸠。由于犹大和以色列的子孙仅代表主的教会的内在和外在敬拜，然而比起其他人，他们更使一切敬拜纯由外在构成，所以根据此处“迦南”的含义，他们比其他人更适合叫做“迦南”。</p>

<p><strong>[NCE]1097.</strong> Canaan will be slave to him means that the type of individual who identifies worship exclusively with the outward show of it is among those who are able to serve people of the church in lowly ways. This can best be seen from the things that people in the Jewish church represented.{*1} In the Jewish church, Judah and Israel represented the inner church. Judah represented a heavenly church; Israel, a spiritual one; Jacob, the outer church. But people who identified worship exclusively with the outward show of it were represented by non-Jews, whom they called foreigners. These were their slaves, who performed menial tasks in that church. In Isaiah, for example:<br />Strangers will stand and pasture your flock, and the children of a foreigner will be your farmers and your vinedressers. And you will be called Jehovah's priests, attendants of our God; it will be said to you, "The wealth of the gentile nations you will eat, and their glory you will glory in." (<a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_1097/bible_king-james-version_isaiah_61_5-6" target=_top>Isaiah 61:5-6</a>)<br />Heavenly kinds of people are called Jehovah's priests; spiritual ones, God's attendants. Those who see worship as consisting only in outward appearances are called children of a foreigner, destined to serve in the fields and vineyards.<br />[2] In the same author:<br />The children of a foreigner will rebuild the walls, and their monarchs will tend to you. (<a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_1097/bible_king-james-version_isaiah_60_10" target=_top>Isaiah 60:10</a>)<br />This verse too mentions their labor as slaves. In Joshua, concerning the Gibeonites:<br />"A curse on you! And the slave will not be cut off from you,{*2} or those chopping wood and drawing water for the House of my God." Joshua on that day made them choppers of wood and drawers of water for the assembly — particularly for Jehovah's altar. (<a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_1097/bible_king-james-version_joshua_9_23" target=_top>Joshua 9:23</a>, <a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_1097/bible_king-james-version_joshua_9_27" target=_top>27</a>)<br />A pact was made with the Gibeonites, though. What kind of people they therefore represented may be seen elsewhere [<a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_1097/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_3058" target=_top>3058</a>, <a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_1097/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_4431" target=_top>4431</a>, <a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_1097/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_6860" target=_top>6860</a>], but they were among those who would act as servants in the church.<br />A law was laid down for foreigners, stating that if they accepted peace and opened their gates they would serve as tribute in the form of slave labor (<a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_1097/bible_king-james-version_deuteronomy_20_11" target=_top>Deuteronomy 20:11</a>; <a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_1097/bible_king-james-version_1-kings_9_21-22" target=_top>1 Kings 9:21-22</a>).<br />Each and every thing written about the Jewish church in the Word represented the Lord's kingdom — a kingdom that by its very nature requires everyone, of whatever identity or character, to do something useful. Nothing but usefulness is regarded by the Lord in his kingdom. Even people in hell have to be useful, but the uses they fill are very lowly. Some of the people doing menial work in the other world are individuals whose worship had been completely external, disconnected as it was from any inner content.<br />[3] Furthermore, representative meanings in the Jewish church were such that they imply nothing about the person filling a role but only about the phenomenon that the person represented. Jews, for instance, were anything but heavenly people, and yet that is the kind of people they represented.{*3} By the same token, Israel was anything but a spiritual person, and yet that is what he represented; and the same for Jacob and all the others — including the monarchs and priests, who nonetheless represented the Lord's royal power and holiness. The point is illustrated even more clearly by the fact that inanimate objects also filled a representative role. These included Aaron's vestments, the altar itself, the tables holding the loaves, the lamps, and the bread and wine, not to mention adult cattle, young cattle, he-goats, sheep, she-goats, lambs, pigeons, and turtledoves.{*4} The children of Judah and Israel merely represented the internal and external worship that takes place in the Lord's church, while more than any other people they considered worship to consist only in outward acts. Consequently they more than any others are the ones who can be called Canaan, in view of his symbolism here.<br /><br /><strong>Footnotes:</strong><br />{*1} On the Jewish, or representative church, see note 3 in <a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_1097/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_994" target=_top>994</a>.

And Canaan shall be his servant. That this signifies that such as make worship consist solely in externals are among those who may perform vile services to the men of the church, is evident especially 
from the representatives in the Jewish Church. In the Jewish Church the internal church was represented by Judah and Israel; by Judah the celestial church, by Israel the spiritual church, and by Jacob 
the external church. But those who made worship consist solely in externals were represented by the Gentiles, whom they called strangers, and who were their servants, and performed menial services 
in the church. As in Isaiah: </p>
<p>     Strangers shall stand and feed your flock, and the sons of the stranger shall be your plowmen and your vinedressers; but ye shall be called the priests of Jehovah; the 
ministers of our God shall ye be called; ye shall eat the wealth of the Gentiles, and in their glory shall ye boast yourselves (Isa. 61:5-6). Here celestial men are called the "priests of Jehovah" 
spiritual men the "ministers of our God;" those who make worship consist solely in externals are called the "sons of the stranger" who should serve in their fields and vineyards.  [2] Again: </p>
<p>     The 
sons of the stranger shall build up thy walls, and their kings shall minister unto thee (Isa. 60:10), where in like manner their services are mentioned. In Joshua concerning the Gibeonites: </p>
<p>     
Now therefore ye are cursed, and there shall not be cut off from you a servant, both hewers of wood and drawers of water for the house of my God; and Joshua made them that day hewers of wood and drawers 
of water for the congregation, especially for the altar of Jehovah (Josh. 9:23, 27).It may be seen elsewhere who were represented by the Gibeonites, because of the covenant made with them, in spite 
of which however they were among those who served in the church. Concerning strangers, a law was delivered, that if they would receive peace and open their gates, they should be tributary and serve (Deut. 
20:11; 1 Kings 9:21-22). Everything written in the Word concerning the Jewish Church was representative of the kingdom of the Lord. The kingdom of the Lord is such that everyone in it, whosoever 
and whatsoever he may be, must perform some use. Nothing but use is regarded by the Lord in His kingdom. Even the infernals must perform some use, but the uses which they perform are most vile. Among 
those who in the other life perform vile uses are those who have had merely external worship, separated from internal. [3] Moreover the representatives in the Jewish Church were of such a nature that 
there was no thought about the person that represented, but only about the thing represented thereby; as for instance in the case of the Jews, who were by no means celestial men, and yet represented 
them; and Israel again was by no means a spiritual man, yet represented him; and so it was with Jacob and the rest. The same was the case with the kings and priests, by whom was represented the royalty 
and holiness of the Lord. This is very evident from the use of inanimate things for representation, as Aaron's garments, the altar itself, the tables for bread, the lamps, the bread and wine, besides 
oxen, bullocks, goats, sheep, kids, lambs, pigeons, and turtledoves. And because the sons of Judah and Israel only represented the internal and external worship of the Lord's church, and yet more than 
others made all worship consist in externals, they above all others may be called "Canaan" according to his signification here. </p>

<p align="center"><b>Elliott(1983-1999) 1097</b></p><p><b>1097.</b>
'Canaan will be a slave to him' means that such people as make worship consist solely in external things are among those who are able to perform inferior services to members of the Church. This becomes 
clear especially from the representatives in the Jewish Church. In the Jewish Church the internal Church was represented by Judah and Israel - the celestial Church by Judah, the spiritual by Israel 
- and the external Church by Jacob. People however who made worship consist solely in external things were represented by 'the gentiles' whom they called foreigners. The latter were to be 'their slaves' 
and were to perform inferior services in the Church, as in Isaiah,  </p>
<blockquote>
Aliens will stand and pasture your flock, and sons of the foreigner will be your field-workers and your vine-dressers; and you 
will be called the priests of Jehovah, you will be spoken of as the ministers of our God. You will eat the wealth of the gentiles, and in their glory will you glory. <a href="http://bible.gospelcom.net/cgi-bin/bible?passage=Isa%2061:5,%206&amp;version=ESV&amp;interface=print&amp;showfn=yes&amp;showxref">Isa 61:5, 6</a>. 
</blockquote>
<p>Here celestial 
people are called 'the priests of Jehovah', spiritual people 'the ministers of God', while those who made worship consist solely in external things are called 'sons of the foreigner' who were to serve 
in their fields and vineyards. </p>
<p></p>
<p><b>[2]</b>
 In the same prophet, </p>
<blockquote>
The sons of the foreigner will build up your walls, and their kings will minister to you. <a href="http://bible.gospelcom.net/cgi-bin/bible?passage=Isa%2060:10&amp;version=ESV&amp;interface=print&amp;showfn=yes&amp;showxref">Isa 60:10</a>. 
</blockquote>
<p>Here similar reference is made to 
the service they were to render. In reference to the Gibeonites the following is said in Joshua,  </p>
<blockquote>
You are cursed, and some of you will always be slaves,<A name="fntext1"></a><A href="#fn1"><sup>a</sup></a> both hewers of wood and drawers of water 
for the house of my God. Joshua made them on that day hewers of wood and drawers of water for the congregation, especially for the altar of Jehovah. <a href="http://bible.gospelcom.net/cgi-bin/bible?passage=Josh%209:23,%2027&amp;version=ESV&amp;interface=print&amp;showfn=yes&amp;showxref">Josh 9:23, 27</a>. 
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
It may be seen elsewhere whom the 
Gibeonites represented because of the covenant made with them, even though they belonged among those who were to be servants in the Church. Regarding foreigners, the law was laid down that if they would 
accept peace and open their gates they would become tributary and serve,<A name="fntext2"></a><A href="#fn2"><sup>b</sup></a> <a href="http://bible.gospelcom.net/cgi-bin/bible?passage=Deut%2020:11;%201&amp;version=ESV&amp;interface=print&amp;showfn=yes&amp;showxref">Deut 20:11; 1</a> 
</blockquote>
Kings 9:21, <a href="22.htm">22</a>. Every single detail written down in the Word concerning the Jewish Church was representative 
of the Lord's kingdom. The Lord's kingdom is such that everyone, no matter who or what kind of person, must perform a use. In His kingdom the Lord looks to nothing else than use. Even those in hell 
have to perform a use, though the uses they do perform are the lowest of all. Among those performing inferior uses are people in the next life whose worship has been wholly external, separated from 
internal.  </p>
<p></p>
<p><b>[3]</b>
 Furthermore representatives in the Jewish Church were such that no attention was paid to the person who represented, but to that which was represented by him. The Jews, for example, 
who were anything but celestial people, nevertheless represented these, while Israel, anything but a spiritual man, nevertheless represented that man; and it was similar with Jacob and the rest. The same 
applied to kings and priests; they nevertheless represented the Kingship and Holiness of the Lord. This matter becomes clearer still from the fact that even inanimate objects were representative, 
such as Aaron's garments, the altar itself, the tables with the leaves on them, the lamps, bread and wine; as well as oxen, calves, goats, sheep, kids, lambs, doves, and pigeons. And because the sons 
of Judah and Israel did no more than represent the internal and the external worship of the Lord's Church, and yet more than anybody else made all worship consist merely in external things, it is therefore 
they, more than all others, who may be called 'Canaan' according to his meaning here.

Quod 'erit Canaan servus illi' significet quod tales qui in externis solum cultum ponunt, sint inter eos qui vilia servitia praestare possint hominibus Ecclesiae, constare imprimis potest a repraesentativis 
in Ecclesia Judaica: in Ecclesia Judaica repraesentabatur interna Ecclesia per Jehudam et Israelem, per 'Jehudam' Ecclesia caelestis, per 'Israelem' Ecclesia spiritualis, per 'Jacobum' Ecclesia 
externa; qui autem in externis solum ponebant cultum, repraesentabantur per 'gentes,' quas vocabant alienigenas, qui 'servi eorum' essent, et vilia servitia in Ecclesia praestarent, ut apud Esaiam, 
 	Stabunt alieni et pascent gregem vestrum, et filii alienigenae agricolae vestri, et vinitores vestri; et vos sacerdotes Jehovae vocabimini, ministri Dei nostri dicetur vobis; opes gentium comedetis, 
et in gloria eorum gloriabimini, lxi 5 [6,];              ubi caelestes homines appellantur 'sacerdotes Jehovae,' spirituales 'ministri Dei'; qui in externis solum ponunt cultum 'filii alienigenae,' 
qui servirent in agris et in vineis: [2] apud eundem, 	Aedificabunt filii alienigenae muros, et reges eorum 	ministrabunt tibi, lx 10;                                          ubi similiter servitia 
eorum memorantur: de Gibeonitis apud Josuam, 	Maledicti vos, et non exscindetur ex vobis servus, et caedentes ligna, et haurientes aquas domui Dei mei.... Dedit eos Josua in die hoc caesores lignorum, 
et haustores aquarum congregationi, imprimis altari Jehovae, ix 23, 27; </p>
<p>quos autem 'Gibeonitae' repraesentabant quia cum iis foedus factum, alibi {1} videatur; usque inter eos qui servirent in 
Ecclesia.  De alienigenis lex lata, 'si reciperent pacem et aperirent portas, quod essent in tributum servientis,' Deut. xx 11, I Reg. ix 21, 22.  Omnia et singula quae in Verbo scripta sunt de Ecclesia 
Judaica, repraesentativa fuerunt regni Domini; regnum Domini est tale ut omnis quicumque et qualiscumque sit, usum praestare debeat; nihil est nisi usus qui a Domino spectatur in Ipsius regno; etiam 
infernales debent usum praestare, sed usus quos praestant, sunt vilissimi; inter eos qui viles usus praestant, sunt ii in altera vita quibus solum externus cultus separatus ab interno fuit.  [3] Ceterum 
repraesentativa in Ecclesia Judaica fuerunt talia ut nihil reflecteretur super personam quae repraesentabat, sed 'super rem quae repraesentabatur; sicut Judaei, qui nihil minus fuerunt quam caelestes 
homines et usque repraesentabant illos; ita Israel nihil minus quam spiritualis homo, usque repraesentabat illum, similiter Jacob, et ceteri; tum reges et sacerdotes, sed usque per eos repraesentabatur 
Regium et Sanctum Domini; quod manifestius constare potest ex eo quod res mortuae quoque repraesentarent, sicut vestes Aharonis, ipsum altare, mensae ubi panes, et lucernae, panis et vinum, praeter 
boves, juvencos, hircos, oves, capras, agnos, columbas, turtures: et quia filii Jehudae et Israelis solum repraesentabant cultum internum et externum Ecclesiae Domini, et usque prae ceteris modo 
in externis ponebant omnem cultum, ideo prae ceteris sunt ii qui 'Canaan,' secundum significationem ejus hic, possunt dici. 	@1 See n. 3058 and 4431.$ </p>
