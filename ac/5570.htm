<h3 align="center" class="ired">属天的奥秘 第5570节</h3>
<h4 align="center"></h4><p><strong>5570.</strong>有许多灵人，尤其女性，以为拥有一个漂亮的外表才是最要紧的，不去思想比外表更深刻的东西。她们几乎不怎么思想永生。对女性来说，在女子成年期，也就是通常在结婚前到来的强烈欲望消退之时以先，这是可以原谅的。但是，她们若长大成人，能更好地理解事情后仍一味专注于这些事，就会获得一种死后依然存在的性格。在来世，这种女人看上去拥有长长地、披在脸上的头发；在她们的想象中，这头发使她们显得优雅，她们还在梳头。因为“梳头”表示使属世事物看上去富有吸引力（<a href="5247.htm">5247</a>节）。其他灵人由此知道这些女人的性质；因为灵人能她们的头发，如头发的颜色、长度、梳理，知道就这些女人在世时的属世生命而言，她们是什么样。</p>

<p align="center"><b>Potts(1905-1910) 5570</b></p><p><b>5570.</b>
There are many, especially women, who have vested everything in adornment, nor have they thought higher, and scarcely anything about eternal life. This is pardoned to women until the age of womanhood, 
when the ardor which is wont to precede marriage ceases; but if they persist in such things in adult age, when they can know better, they then contract a nature which remains after death. Such appear 
in the other life with long hair spread over the face, which they also comb, vesting elegance therein; for "to comb the hair" signifies to accommodate natural things so that they appear becoming (see 
n. 5247). From this their quality is known by others; for spirits can tell from the color, length, and arrangement of the hair what the persons had been as to natural life in the world. </p>

<p align="center"><b>Elliott(1983-1999) 5570</b></p><p><b>5570.</b>
Many spirits exist, especially female ones, who have imagined that having an attractive appearance was all that mattered and who have thought about nothing deeper than this. They have given scarcely 
any thought to eternal life. This is excusable in females up to the time of young womanhood, when the burning desire which usually comes before marriage has died down. But if, when they become more mature 
adults and are able to understand something better, they continue in those ways, they acquire a character that remains with them after death. Such women are seen in the next life, possessing long 
hair which falls over their faces and which, in their imagination that such makes them elegant, they are also combing. (For 'combing one's hair' means making natural things look attractive, <a href="5247.htm">5247</a>.) From 
this other spirits recognize what those women are like; for spirits can know from their hair - from its colour, length, arrangement - what those women have been like so far as their natural life in 
the world is concerned. </p>

</p><b>5570.</b>
Sunt plures, cumprimis feminae, quae in decoris posuerunt omne nec cogitaverunt altius, et vix aliquid de vita aeterna; hoc feminis ignoscitur usque ad aetatem juvenilem cum desiit ardor qui praecedere 
solet conjugium; sed si in aetate adultiore in illis perseverant cum aliter possunt intelligere, tunc trahunt naturam quae manet post mortem; tales in altera vita apparent longis et expansis super 
faciem comis, quas quoque pectunt, elegantiam in illis ponentes; nam `pectere comas' significat accommodare naturalia ut decora appareant, n. 5247; inde cognoscuntur ab aliis quales sunt; spiritus enim 
scire possunt ex coma, ejus colore, longitudine, diffusione, quales fuerant quoad vitam naturalem in mundo. </p>
