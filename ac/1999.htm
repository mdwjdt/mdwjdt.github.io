<h3 align="center" class="ired">属天的奥秘 第1999节</h3>
<h4 align="center"></h4><p><strong>1999.</strong>“亚伯兰脸伏于地”表崇拜。这是显而易见的，无需解释。“脸伏于地”是上古教会、因而古人的一种崇拜仪式。因为“脸”表内在，“脸伏于地”代表内在的谦卑状态，并由此在犹太人的代表性教会中成为一个惯例。真正的崇拜，或内心的谦卑必在主面前脸伏于地，因为这是它自然流露的行为。事实上，内心的谦卑等于承认自己无非是污秽，同时承认主对这类污秽的无限怜悯。当心里牢记这两个承认时，心智本身就会卑微地向下朝向地狱，并使身体俯伏。它也不会提升自己，直到被主提升。这是所有真谦卑的情形，这种谦卑还伴随着对被主的怜悯提升的一种直觉。这就是上古教会成员的谦卑。然而，若崇拜并非出于内心的谦卑，情况则迥然不同（参看<a href="1153.htm">1153</a>节）。<br />从福音书的圣言可知，主崇拜耶和华祂的父，向祂祷告。祂仿佛对着其他人而非祂自己这样做，尽管耶和华就在祂里面。但那时，主所处的状态是其谦卑的状态。该状态的性质在第一卷有所阐述，也就是说，那时，祂处于来自母亲的软弱人性中。不过，祂越脱去这人性，披上神性，祂的状态就越不同，这种状态被称为祂的荣耀状态。在前一种状态（谦卑状态），祂将耶和华当作不同于祂自己的某个其他人来崇拜，尽管耶和华就在祂里面。因为如前所述，祂的内在就是耶和华。而在后一种状态，也就是荣耀状态，祂与耶和华说话，就是与祂自己说话，因为祂就是耶和华自己。 <br />然而，这些问题的真相无法理解，除非人知道何为内在，以及内在如何进入外在进行运作；而且还知道内在与外在如何彼此截然不同，然而又结合在一起。这个问题可通过类似的事，也就是通过人的内在，以及它流入外在进行运作的方式来说明。人有一个内在，一个内层或理性，和一个外在，对此，参看前文（<a href="1889.htm">1889</a>，<a href="1940.htm">1940</a>节）。使得人成为人、有别于动物的，就是人的内在。正是凭借这内在，人死后才能活着，并活到永远。也正是凭借这内在，主才能将他提升到天使之列。这内在就是最初形式，人通过这最初形式变成并成为人，主凭借这内在与人结合。最接近主的天堂本身就是由这些人的内在组成的，不过，由于这内在甚至高于至内在的天使天堂，故这些内在属于主自己。 整个人类以这种方式直接呈现于主的双目之下。因为天堂不存在诸如出现在尘世那样的距离，天堂之上更不存在任何距离（参看记事，<a href="1275.htm">1275</a>，<a href="1277.htm">1277</a>节）。<br />人的这些内在本身没有任何生命，只是接受主生命的形式。因此，人越处于邪恶，无论实际的还是遗传的，可以说就越与这属于主并与主同在的内在分离，从而越与主分离；因为尽管这内在已经与人联结，并且与他不可分割，但他越远离主，可以说就越使自己与它分离（参看<a href="1594.htm">1594</a>节）。不过，这种分离不是指与它完全隔绝，因为这样此人死后就没法继续活着了；这种分离是指下面的那些能力，也就是他的理性人和外在人的那些能力那一方的一种分歧和不一致。哪里有分歧和不一致，哪里就有与主的分离；只要没有分歧和不一致，这人就通过内在与主结合。人越拥有爱和仁，越会产生结合，因为爱和仁产生结合。这是人的情况。<br />主的内在是耶和华自己，因为祂从耶和华成孕。耶和华无法被分割，或像儿子从人父成孕那样变成相对的另一个。因为与人性不同，神性无法被分割，只能始终是那同一个。主将人性本质与这内在融合起来。而且，主的内在因是耶和华，故与人的内在不同；主的内在并非接受生命的形式，而是生命本身。祂的人性本质通过这融合也变成生命本身。所以，主常常说，祂就是生命。如约翰福音：<br />因为父怎样在自己有生命，就赐给儿子也照样在自己有生命。（约翰福音<a href="http://39-27.cn/约5.26.htm">5:26</a>）<br />此外还有其它经文（约翰福音<a href="http://39-27.cn/约1.4.htm">1:4</a>；<a href="http://39-27.cn/约5.21.htm">5:21</a>；<a href="http://39-27.cn/约6.33.htm">6:33</a>，<a href="http://39-27.cn/约6.35.htm">35</a>，<a href="http://39-27.cn/约6.48.htm">48</a>；<a href="http://39-27.cn/约11.25.htm">11:25</a>）。因此，主越处于祂通过遗传从母亲那里得来的人性，就越显得不同于耶和华，并将祂当作某个其他人而非祂自己来崇拜。而祂越脱去这人性，就越与耶和华没有分别，而是与祂为一。如前所述，前一种状态是主的谦卑状态，而后一种状态则是祂的荣耀状态。</p>

<p align="center"><b>Potts(1905-1910) 1999</b></p><p><b>1999.</b>
Abram fell upon his faces.* That this signifies adoration, is evident without explication. To fall upon the face was a rite of adoration in the Most Ancient Church, and thence in that of the Ancients, 
for the reason that the face signified the interiors, and the state of their humiliation was represented by falling upon the face; hence in the Jewish representative church it became a customary ceremonial. 
True adoration, or humiliation of heart, carries with it prostration to the earth upon the face before the Lord, as a gesture naturally flowing from it. For in humiliation of heart there is the 
acknowledgment of self as being nothing but filthiness, and at the same time the acknowledgment of the Lord's infinite mercy toward that which is such; and when the mind is kept in these two acknowledgments, 
the very mind droops in lowliness toward hell, and prostrates the body; nor does it uplift itself until it is uplifted by the Lord. This takes place in all true humiliation, with a perception 
of being uplifted by the Lord's mercy. Such was the humiliation of the men of the Most Ancient Church; but very different is the case with that adoration which comes not from humiliation of the heart. 
(See n. 1153.)  [2] That the Lord adored and prayed to Jehovah His Father, is known from the Word of the Gospels; and also that He did so as if to one different from Himself, although Jehovah was 
in Him. But the state in which the Lord was at these times was His state of humiliation, the nature of which has been stated in Part First, namely, that He was then in the infirm human that was from 
the mother; but insofar as He put this off, and put on the Divine, He was in another state, which is called His state of glorification. In the former state He adored Jehovah as one different from Himself, 
although in Himself; for, as has been said, His internal was Jehovah; but in the latter, that is, in His state of glorification, He spoke with Jehovah as with Himself, for He was Jehovah Himself. 
 [3] But how the case is with these matters cannot be apprehended unless it is known what the internal is, and how the internal acts into the external; and further, in what manner the internal and the 
external are distinct from each other, and yet are conjoined. This, however, may be illustrated by something that is similar, namely, by the internal in man, and by its influx and operation into the 
external. That man has an internal, an interior or rational, and an external, may be seen above (n. 1889, 1940). Man's internal is that from which he is man, and by which he is distinguished from brute 
animals. By means of this internal he lives after death, and to eternity a man, and by means of it he can be uplifted by the Lord among the angels. This internal is the very first form from which 
a man becomes and is man, and by means of it the Lord is united to man. The very heaven that is nearest the Lord is composed of these human internals; but this is above even the inmost angelic heaven, 
and therefore these internals belong to the Lord Himself. By this means the whole human race is most present under the Lord's eyes, for there is no distance in heaven, such as appears in the sublunary 
world, and still less is there any distance above heaven. (See what is said from experience, n. 1275, 1277.)  [4] These internals of men have no life in themselves, but are forms recipient of the Lord's 
life. Insofar therefore as a man is in evil, whether actual or hereditary, so far has he been as it were separated from this internal which is the Lord's and with the Lord, and thereby so far has 
he been separated from the Lord; for although this internal has been adjoined to man, and is inseparable from him, nevertheless insofar as he recedes from the Lord, so far he as it were separates himself 
from it. (See n. 1594.) But the separation is not an absolute sundering from it, for then the man could no longer live after death; but it is a dissent and disagreement on the part of those faculties 
of his which are below, that is, of his rational and of his external man. Insofar as there is dissent and disagreement, there is disjunction from the Lord; but insofar as there is not dissent and 
disagreement, the man is conjoined with the Lord through the internal, which takes place insofar as the man is in love and charity, for love and charity conjoin. Such is the case with man.  [5] But 
the Lord's internal was Jehovah Himself, because He was conceived from Jehovah, who cannot be divided and become another's, as is the case with a son who is conceived from a human father; for the Divine 
is not divisible, like the human, but is and remains one and the same. To this internal the Lord united the Human Essence; and because the Lord's internal was Jehovah, it was not a form recipient 
of life, like the internal of man, but was life itself. His Human Essence also in like manner was made life by the unition, on which account the Lord so often said that He is Life, as in John: </p>
<p>     As 
the Father hath life in Himself, so hath He given to the Son to have life in Himself (John 5:26); </p>
<p>besides other passages in the same gospel (John 1:4; 5:21; 6:33, 35, 48; 11:25). Insofar therefore 
as the Lord was in the human which He received by inheritance from the mother, so far did He appear distinct from Jehovah and adore Jehovah as one different from Himself. But insofar as the Lord put off 
this human, He was not distinct from Jehovah, but was one with Him. The former state, as before said, was the Lord's state of humiliation; but the latter was His state of glorification. * "Faces" 
is in the plural in both the Hebrew and the Latin because man has really as many faces as affections and it is the same with the Lord, and with a country, and the sea and sky. All these have many faces. 
Even in English we speak of a person having two faces, or being double-faced, and of "making faces" [Reviser.] </p>

<p align="center"><b>Elliott(1983-1999) 1999</b></p><p><b>1999.</b>
That 'Abram fell on his face'<A name="fntext1"></a><A href="#fn1"><sup>a</sup></a> means adoration is clear without explanation. Falling on one's face' was the reverent way in which the Most Ancient Church, and as a consequence the ancients, expressed 
adoration. The reason they expressed it in this way was that 'the face' meant the inward parts, and 'falling on one's face'<A name="fntext1"></a><A href="#fn1"><sup>a</sup></a> represented a state of humiliation of those inward parts; and from this it 
became in the Jewish representative Church an act of reverence. True adoration or humility of heart entails prostration before the Lord face-downwards on the ground as the natural action resulting from 
it. Indeed humiliation of heart entails the acknowledgement of oneself as being nothing but uncleanness, and at the same time the acknowledgement of the Lord's infinite mercy towards such. When these 
acknowledgements are fixed in the mind, the mind itself casts itself down towards hell and prostrates the body. Nor does it raise itself until raised up by the Lord, as happens in all true humiliation, 
accompanied by a perception that such raising up is of the Lord's mercy. Such was the humiliation of members of the Most Ancient Church. It is different however with adoration which does not flow 
from humiliation of heart, see <a href="1153.htm">1153</a>. </p>
<p></p>
<p><b>[2]</b>
 It is well known from the Word, in the Gospels, that the Lord adored and prayed to Jehovah, His Father, and that He did so as though to Someone other than 
Himself, even though Jehovah was within Him. But the state that the Lord experienced at such times was the state of His humiliation, the nature of which has been discussed in Volume One, namely this, 
that at such times as these He was in the infirm human derived from the mother. But to the extent He cast this off and took on the Divine His state was different, which state is called the state of His 
glorification. In the first state He adored Jehovah as Someone other than Himself, even though He was within Him, for, as has been stated, His Internal was Jehovah. In the latter state however, that 
is to say, the state of glorification, He spoke to Jehovah as to Himself, since He was Jehovah Himself. </p>
<p></p>
<p><b>[3]</b>
 The truth of all this however cannot be grasped unless one knows what the internal is and 
how the internal operates into the external, and furthermore how the internal and external are distinct and separate and yet joined together. The matter may be illustrated however by means of something 
similar, namely by means of the internal with man and of its influx and operation into the external with him. For the fact that man has an internal, an interior or rational, and an external, see what 
has appeared already in <a href="1889.htm">1889</a>, <a href="1940.htm">1940</a>. Man's internal is that which makes him human and distinguishes him from animals. It is by means of this internal that man lives on after death and for ever, and 
by means of it the Lord can raise him up among angels. It is the prior or primary form from which anyone becomes and is a human being, and it is by means of this internal that the Lord is united to man. 
The heaven itself that is nearest to the Lord consists of these human internals, but being above even the inmost angelic heaven these internals therefore belong to the Lord Himself. In this way the 
entire human race is directly present beneath the eyes of the Lord. Distance, a visible feature of this sublunary world, does not exist in heaven, still less above heaven - see what has been mentioned 
from experience in <a href="1275.htm">1275</a>, <a href="1277.htm">1277</a>. </p>
<p></p>
<p><b>[4]</b>
 These inward aspects of men possess no life in themselves but are recipient forms of the Lord's life. To the extent then that anyone is under the influence of 
evil, both that of his own doing and that which is hereditary, he has been so to speak separated from this internal which is the Lord's and resides with the Lord, and so has been separated from the Lord. 
For although that human internal is joined to the person and cannot be separated from him, yet to the extent he moves away from the Lord he does in a way separate himself from it, see <a href="1594.htm">1594</a>. But such 
separation is not a complete severance from that human internal - for if it were, man would no longer be able to live after death; but it is a lack of harmony and agreement with it on the part of his 
capacities which are beneath it, that is, of his rational and external man. Insofar as disharmony and disagreement are present there is no conjunction, but insofar as they are absent man is joined 
to the Lord by means of the internal, which is achieved in the measure that he is moved by love and charity, for love and charity effect conjunction. Such is the situation with man. </p>
<p></p>
<p><b>[5]</b>
 But the Lord's 
Internal was Jehovah Himself, since He was conceived from Jehovah, who cannot be divided or become the relative of another, like a son who has been conceived from a human father. For unlike the human, 
the Divine is not capable of being divided but is and remains one and the same. To this Internal the Lord united the Human Essence. Moreover because the Lord's Internal was Jehovah it was not, like 
man's internal, a recipient form of life, but life itself. Through that union His Human Essence as well became life itself. Hence the Lord's frequent declaration that He is Life, as in John, </p>
<blockquote>
As 
the Father has Life in Himself, so He has granted the Son to have Life in Himself. <a href="http://bible.gospelcom.net/cgi-bin/bible?passage=John%205:26&amp;version=ESV&amp;interface=print&amp;showfn=yes&amp;showxref">John 5:26</a>. 
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
And elsewhere besides this in the same <a href="http://bible.gospelcom.net/cgi-bin/bible?passage=gospel%201:4;%205:21;%206:33,%2035,%2048;%2011:25&amp;version=ESV&amp;interface=print&amp;showfn=yes&amp;showxref">gospel 1:4; 5:21; 6:33, 35, 48; 11:25</a>. 
</blockquote>
'The Son' is used to mean 
the Lord's Human Essence. To the extent therefore that the Lord was in the human which He received by heredity from the mother, He appeared to be distinct and separate from Jehovah, and worshipped Jehovah 
as Someone other than Himself. But to the extent He cast off this human, the Lord was not distinct and separate from Jehovah but one with Him. The first state, as has been mentioned, was the state 
of the Lord's humiliation, but the second the state of His glorification.

`Cecidit Abram super facies suas': quod significet adorationem, constat absque explicatione.  Cadere super facies, fuit ritus adorandi Antiquissimae Ecclesiae, et inde antiquorum, ex causa quia `facies' 
significabat interiora, quorum humiliationis status repraesentabatur per `cadere super facies'; inde in Ecclesia repraesentativa Judaica sollemne factum; adoratio vera seu humiliatio cordis prostrationem 
ad terram super facies coram Domino, ut gestum naturaliter inde profluentem, secum habet; in humiliatione enim cordi: est agnitio sui, quod nihil nisi spurcum sit, et simul agnitio infinitae 
misericordiae Domini erga tale; in quibus agnitionibus cum tenetur mens, ipsa mens versus infernum se demittit et prosternit corpus, nec se elevat priusquam a Domino elevatur; quod fit in omni ver humiliatione 
cum perceptione elevationis ex misericordia Domini; tali fuit humiliatio hominum Antiquissimae Ecclesiae; sed aliter se habet cum adoratione quae non ex humiliatione cordis, videatur n. 1153. 
 [2] Quod Dominus (x)adoraverit et (x)oraverit Jehovam Patrem Suum, ex Verbo apud Evangelistas notum est, et hoc sicut Alium a Se, tametsi Jehovah in Ipso; sed status in quo tunc Dominus fuerat, status 
humiliationis Ipsius fuit, qui qualis fuit, in Parte Prima dictum est, nempe quod tunc in infirmo humano, quod a matre fuit {1}; at quantum hoc exuit et Divinum induit, tantum in alio statu fuit qui 
status dicitur status glorificationis Ipsius; in priore statu adoravit Jehovam sicut Alium a Se, tametsi in Se, nam, ut dictum, Internum Ipsius fuit Jehovah; sed in hoc, nempe statu glorificationis, 
locutus est cum Jehovah ut cum Se, nam fuit Ipse Jehovah.  [3] At quomodo haec se habent, non capi potest nisi sciatur quid internum, et quomodo internum agit in externum; et porro quomodo internum 
et externum inter se distincta sunt, et usque conjuncta; sed tamen hoc illustrari potest per simile, nempe per internum apud hominem et ejus influxum et operationem in externum apud cum; quod homo internum 
habeat, quod interius seu rationale, et quod externum, videatur prius n. 1889, 1940; internum hominis est ex quo homo est homo et per quod distinguitur a brutis animalibus; per hoc internum vivit 
homo post mortem et in aeternum, et per illud a Domino inter angelos potest elevari; est ipsa prima forma ex qua homo fit et est homo; per internum hoc Dominus unitur homini; ipsum caelum Domino proximum 
est ab internis his humanis, sed usque supra caelum intimum angelicum, quare illa sunt Ipsius Domini; (m)ita omne humanum genus est praesentissimum sub oculis Domini; distantia quae apparet in sublunari 
orbe, nulla est in caelo, minus supra caelum, videantur quae ab experientia n. 1275, 1277(n): [4] interna illa hominum non habent vitam in se, sed sunt formae recipientes vitae Domini; quantum 
nunc homo est in malo, tam actuali quam hereditario, tantum quasi separatus est ab hoc interno quod est Domini et apud Dominum, ita tantum a Domino; nam illud tametsi adjunctum est homini, et ab eo 
inseparabile, usque tamen homo quantum recedit a Domino, (o)tantum se quasi separat ab illo, videatur n. 1594; sed separatio non est evulsio ab illo, tunc enim homo non amplius potuisset vivere post mortem, 
sed est dissensus et dissidium illarum ejus facultatum quae infra sunt, hoc est, rationalis et externi ejus hominis ab illo; (x)quantum est dissensus et dissidium, tantum disjungitur, at quantum 
non est dissensus et dissidium, tantum conjungitur homo per internum Domino, quod fit quantum est in amore et charitate, nam amor et charitas conjungit; [5] ita se habet apud hominem.  Sed Domini Internum 
fuit Ipse Jehovah, quoniam conceptus a Jehovah, Qui non dividi et fieri alterius potest, sicut filius {2} qui conceptus a patre homine; Divinum {3} enim sicut humanum, non dividuum est, sed unum 
et idem est et manet; cum hoc Interno Dominus univit Essentiam Humanam; et quia Domini Internum fuit Jehovah, non fuit forma recipiens vitae, sicut internum hominis, sed fuit ipsa vita: Ipsius quoque 
Humana Essentia per unitionem similiter facta est vita, quare toties Dominus dixit quod sit Vita, ut apud Johannem, 	Quemadmodum Pater habet Vitam in Se Ipso, ita dedit Filio habere Vitam in Se Ipso, 
v 26; </p>
<p>praeter alibi apud eundem i 4; v 21, vi 33, 35, 48; xi 25; `per `Filium' intelligitur Humana Domini Essentia'; quantum itaque Dominus in humano fuit quod hereditario accepit a matre, tantum 
apparuit distinctus a Jehovah, et adoravit Jehovam sicut Alium a Se; at quantum exuit hoc humanum, tantum fuit Dominus non distinctus a Jehovah sed unus cum Ipso; ille status fuit, sicut dictum, status 
humiliationis Domini, hic vero status glorificationis Ipsius. 	@1 in quod natus fuit.$ 	@2 filii.$ 	@3 So A but with Humanum. Both A and I seem ambiguous, but the context and careful examination 
of A suggest that the meaning is Divinum enim non est dividuum, sicut est humanum.$ </p>
