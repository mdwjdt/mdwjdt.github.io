<h3 align="center" class="ired">属天的奥秘 第9928节</h3>
<h4 align="center"></h4><p><strong>9928.</strong>“使他不至于死亡”表好叫代表，以及通过它而与天堂的联结不会丧失。这从“死亡”的含义清楚可知，当论及亚伦和他的职分时，“死亡”是指代表，因而与天堂的联结的消亡。因为亚伦代表主，他的职分代表拯救的整个工作，就人而言，代表敬拜。这敬拜是代表，与天堂的联结通过代表性的敬拜而实现，这在前面有大量说明（可参看<a href="9320.htm">9320</a>e节所提到的地方；前面还说明，在以色列和犹太民族当中的教会代表是什么，<a href="9280.htm">9280</a>，<a href="9457.htm">9457</a>，<a href="9481.htm">9481</a>，<a href="9576.htm">9576</a>，<a href="9577.htm">9577</a>节；那时主与天堂通过代表与人类联结<a href="9481.htm">9481</a>节）。也正因如此，当亚伦供圣职时，他就穿上代表天事物的衣服；若不穿，就会死亡。尤其如果他进去供圣职，而百姓没有意识到这一点，他就会死亡；因为教会的代表与百姓同在，而主，就是一切敬拜的源头和对象的代表则与亚伦同在。</p>

That he die not. That this signifies that the representative does not perish, and therewith the conjunction with the heavens, is evident from the signification of "dying," when said of Aaron and his 
office, as being the ceasing of the representatives, and consequently of conjunction with the heavens; for by Aaron was represented the Lord, and by his office the whole work of salvation, and on the 
part of man, worship. That this worship was representative, and that by means of representative worship there was conjunction with the heavens, has been abundantly shown. (See the places cited in n. 9320; 
also what was the representative of a church with the Israelitish and Jewish nation, n. 9280, 9457, 9481, 9576, 9577; and that the conjunction of the Lord and of heaven with man at that time was 
by means of representatives, n. 9481.) From this also it was that when Aaron was performing holy things he was clothed with garments that represented heavenly things; and that if he had done otherwise 
he would have died; especially if he had gone in to perform holy things without the knowledge of the people; for with the people there was the representative of a church, and with Aaron the representative 
of the Lord, from whom and toward whom is everything of worship. </p>

'That he may not die' means so that what is representative, and the joining to heaven through it, may not be lost. This is clear from the meaning of 'dying', when the subject is Aaron and his office, 
as the demise of things that are representative and consequently of the joining to heaven. For Aaron represented the Lord, while his office represented the whole work of salvation, and - on man's part 
- worship. This worship, as has been shown extensively before, was representative, and through representative worship a joining to heaven was effected, see the places referred to in <a href="9320.htm">9320</a> (end). It has 
also been shown what a representative of the Church among the Israelite and Jewish nation was, in <a href="9280.htm">9280</a>, as well as <a href="9457.htm">9457</a>, <a href="9481.htm">9481</a>, <a href="9576.htm">9576</a>, <a href="9577.htm">9577</a>, and that the Lord and heaven were joined to mankind at that 
time through things that were representative, <a href="9481.htm">9481</a>. So it was also that Aaron wore garments that represented heavenly realities whenever he performed sacred duties, and that if he did otherwise he would 
die. Especially would he die if he went to perform sacred duties and the people were not aware of it; for with the people that which was representative of the Church existed, and with Aaron that 
which was representative of the Lord, the Source and the Object of all worship.  </p>

`Ne moriatur': quod significet ne repraesentativum pereat, et sic conjunctio cum caelis, constat ex significatione `mori' cum de Aharone et ejus officio, quod sit cessatio repraesentativorum, et inde 
conjunctionis cum caelis; per Aharonem enim repraesentabatur Dominus, et per officium ejus {1}omne opus salvationis, et a parte hominis, cultus; qui cultus quod fuerit repraesentativus, et quod per 
cultum repraesentativum conjunctio cum caelis, multis (d)prius ostensum est, videantur loca citata n. 9320 fin., tum quid repraesentativum {2}Ecclesiae apud gentem Israeliticam et Judaicam {3}, n. 9280, 
ut et n. 9457, 9481, 9576, 9577, et quod conjunctio Domini (c)ac caeli cum homine tunc per repraesentativa fuerit, n. 9481; inde quoque fuit quod Aharon indutus esset vestibus, quae {4}repraesentabant 
caelestia, cum obiret sancta, et quod si aliter fecisset, moreretur; imprimis si ad sancta obeunda iret nesciente populo, nam apud populum erat Ecclesiae repraesentativum, et apud Aharonem repraesentativum 
Domini, a Quo et ad Quem omne cultus. @1 omnis cultus$ @2 in Ecclesia$ @3 i instituta$ @4 repraesentarent$ </p>
