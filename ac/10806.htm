<p>     1. And from 
the blue, and the crimson, and the scarlet double-dyed they made the garments of ministry, for ministering in what is holy; and they made the garments of holiness for Aaron; as Jehovah commanded Moses.  
    2. And he made the ephod of gold, of blue, and of crimson, and of scarlet double-dyed, and of fine twined linen. </p>
<p>     3. And they spread out thin plates of gold, and he cut off threads to 
work them in the midst of the blue, and in the midst of the crimson, and in the midst of the scarlet double-dyed, and in the midst of the fine linen, with the work of a thinker.      4. Shoulderpieces 
made they for it, joined together; upon the two extremities of it was it joined together.      5. And the girdle of its ephod that was upon it, it was out of it, according to the work thereof; of 
gold, of blue, and of crimson, and of scarlet double-dyed, and fine twined linen; as Jehovah commanded Moses.      6. And they wrought the onyx stones, encompassed with settings of gold, graven with 
the engravings of a signet, upon the names of the sons of Israel.      7. And he put them upon the shoulderpieces of the ephod, to be stones of remembrance for the sons of Israel; as Jehovah commanded 
Moses.      8. And he made the breastplate with the work of a thinker according to the work of the ephod; of gold, of blue, and of crimson, and of scarlet double-dyed, and of fine twined linen.   
   9. It was foursquare; doubled made they the breastplate; a span the length thereof, and a span the breadth thereof, doubled.      10. And they filled into it four rows of stones: a row, a ruby, a 
topaz, and a carbuncle, the first row.      11. And the second row, a chrysoprase, a sapphire, and a diamond.      12. And the third row, a cyanus, an agate and an amethyst.      13. And the fourth 
row, a tarshish, an onyx, and a jasper; they were encompassed with settings of gold in their fillings.      14. And the stones were upon the names of the sons of Israel, twelve, upon their names, the 
engravings of a signet, everyone upon his name, for the twelve tribes.      15. And they made upon the breastplate chains of the border, with cord-work, of pure gold.      16. And they made two settings 
of gold, and two rings of gold; and they put the two rings upon the two extremities of the breastplate.      17. And they put the two cords of gold upon the two rings upon the extremities of the 
breastplate.      18. And the two extremities of the two cords they put on the two settings, and they put them on the shoulderpieces of the ephod, over against the faces thereof.      19. And they 
made two rings of gold, and put them upon the two extremities of the breastplate, upon the edge thereof, which was toward the side of the ephod inward.      20. And they made two rings of gold, and 
put them upon the two shoulderpieces of the ephod underneath, over against its faces, opposite the joining, above the girdle of the ephod.      21. And they bound the breastplate by the rings thereof 
unto the rings of the ephod with a thread of blue, that it might be upon the girdle of the ephod, and that the breastplate withdrew not from upon the ephod; as Jehovah commanded Moses.      22. And 
he made the robe of the ephod with the work of the weaver, all of blue.      23. And the mouth of the robe in the midst thereof, as the mouth of a coat of mail, with an edge for its mouth round about, 
that it should not be rent.      24. And they made upon the skirts of the robe pomegranates of blue, and of crimson, and of scarlet double-dyed, interwoven.      25. And they made bells of pure gold, 
and they put the bells in the midst of the pomegranates upon the skirts of the robe round about, in the midst of the pomegranates; </p>
<p>     26. A bell and a pomegranate, a bell and a pomegranate, upon 
the skirts of the robe round about, to minister; as Jehovah commanded Moses.      27. And they made the tunics of fine linen with the work of the weaver for Aaron, and for his sons.      28. And 
the miter of fine linen, and the ornament of the tiaras of fine linen, and the linen breeches of fine twined linen; </p>
<p>     29. And the belt of fine twined linen, and of blue, and of crimson, and of scarlet 
double-dyed, with the work of an embroiderer; as Jehovah commanded Moses.      30. And they made the plate of the crown of holiness of pure gold, and they wrote upon it the writing, with the engravings 
of a signet, HOLINESS TO JEHOVAH.      31. And they put upon it a thread of blue, to put it upon the miter above; as Jehovah commanded Moses.      32. And all the work of the Habitation of the 
Tent of meeting was finished, and the sons of Israel did according to all that Jehovah commanded Moses, so did they.      33. And they brought the Habitation unto Moses, the Tent, and all its vessels, 
its hooks, its planks, its bars, and its pillars, and its bases; </p>
<p>     34. And the covering of skins of red rams, and the covering of badgers' skins, and the veil of the covering; </p>
<p>     35. The ark 
of the Testimony, and the staves thereof, and the propitiatory; </p>
<p>     36. The table, all the vessels thereof, and the bread of faces; </p>
<p>     37. The pure lampstand, the lamps thereof, the lamps of the 
setting in order, and all the vessels thereof, and the oil for the luminary; </p>
<p>     38. And the altar of gold, and the oil of anointing, and the incense of sweet spices, and the covering for the door 
of the tent; </p>
<p>     39. The altar of brass, and the grating of brass which is for it, its staves, and all its vessels; the laver and its base; </p>
<p>     40. The hangings of the court, its pillars, and its 
bases, and the covering for the gate of the court, the cords thereof, and the pegs thereof, and all the vessels of the service of the Habitation, for the Tent of meeting: </p>
<p>     41. The garments of ministry 
for ministering in what is holy, the garments of holiness for Aaron the priest, and the garments of his sons, to minister in the priest's office.      42. According to all that Jehovah commanded 
Moses, so did the sons of Israel all the service.      43. And Moses saw all the work, and behold they had done it as Jehovah commanded, so had they done; and Moses blessed them. </p>
