<h3 align="center" class="ired">属天的奥秘 第1632节</h3>
<h4 align="center"></h4><p><strong>1632.</strong>我曾与天使谈论过代表物，大意是，世上的植物界中没有一物不以某种方式代表主的国度。他们说，植物界中凡美丽优雅之物都经由天堂来源于主；当主的属天和属灵之物流入自然界时，这类事物就有了实际存在，这就是植物的灵魂或生命的源头。由于这是世所未闻之事，故他们称其为天堂的奥秘。</p><br />

<p><strong>[NCE]1632.</strong> With angels I have discussed representations and the fact that nothing in the plant kingdom on earth fails to represent the Lord's kingdom in some way. They have said that every pretty and attractive specimen of the plant kingdom comes from the Lord by way of heaven; and since the Lord's heavenly and spiritual forces act on the physical world, they actually take on a visible form. That is where the soul or life of plants comes from, and it is the reason that they represent something. As this is unknown in the world, it is called a heavenly secret. </p>

I have spoken with angels concerning representatives, to the effect that there is nothing in the vegetable kingdom on the earth that does not in some way represent the Lord's kingdom. They said that 
all the beautiful and graceful things in the vegetable kingdom derive their origin from the Lord through heaven; and that when the celestial and spiritual things of the Lord inflow into nature, such things 
have actual existence; and that this is the source of the vegetative soul or life. Hence come representatives. And as this is not known in the world, it was called a heavenly secret. </p>

I have spoken to angels about representatives, suggesting that the vegetable kingdom on earth included nothing that was not in some way representative of the Lord's kingdom. They replied that everything 
beautiful and glorious in the vegetable kingdom has its origin in the Lord by way of heaven; and that when celestial and spiritual influences from the Lord enter nature, such things are really created, 
and that this is the origin of the vegetative soul or life. Consequently they are representative. Since this is not known in the world they called it a heavenly arcanum. </p>

</p><b>1632.</b>
Locutus sum cum angelis de repraesentativis, quod nempe in regno vegetabili in tellure, nihil sit quod non aliquo modo repraesentet regnum Domini; dixerunt quod omnia pulchra et decora quae in regno 
vegetabili sunt, originem ducant per caelum a Domino; et cum caelestia et spiritualia Domini influunt in naturam, quod actualiter talia sistantur, quodque inde anima seu vita vegetativa; inde repraesentativa; 
hoc quia nescitur in mundo, dictum est arcanum caeleste. </p>
