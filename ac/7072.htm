<h3 align="center" class="ired">属天的奥秘 第7072节</h3>
<h4 align="center"></h4><p><strong>7072.</strong>后来，我给他们展示各种飞鸟，有大的也有小的，都是我们地球上所存在的那种；因为在来世，这类事物能栩栩如生地呈现出来，灵人和天使的言语本身充满代表。当看到所呈现的这些鸟时，他们一开始想改变它们，但后来却以它们为乐，默然接受，不想再改变它们。原因在于，飞鸟表示事物的知识，此时对这个事实的觉知正流入他们。因此，他们不再改变它们，从而使它们远离自己记忆中的观念。此后，我被允许在他们面前展现一个最怡人的花园，花园里处处是灯柱和灯。这次他们什么也没做，而是忍住了，因为灯柱和灯表示从良善闪耀出的真理。由此明显可知，他们的注意力能集中在物质事物上，只要这些事物在灵义上所具有的含义同时被引入。因为属于灵义的事物从物质事物抽象出来，但以它们来代表。</p>

Afterward I represented to them birds of different sizes, large and small, such as exist on our earth; for in the other life such may be represented as it were to the life, the very speech of spirits 
and angels being full of representations. When they saw those represented birds, they at first desired to change them, but afterward were delighted with them, and acquiesced. The reason was that birds 
signify the knowledges of things, of which fact the perception then flowed in; and therefore they abstained from changing them, and so turning them from the ideas of their memory. Afterward I was allowed 
to represent before them a most pleasing garden full of lights and oil-lamps. This arrested their attention, because lights together with oil-lamps signify truths which shine from good. From this 
it was evident that their attention could be fixed on material things, provided there was at the same time instilled the signification of them in the spiritual sense; for the things of the spiritual 
sense are abstracted from material things, but are represented in them. </p>

After this I represented to them birds of the air, large and small, such as exist on our planet; for these kinds of things can be represented in the next life in a lifelike manner, the actual speech 
of spirits and angels being full of representations. When they saw the birds that were represented, they wished initially to turn them into something different; but they grew pleased with them and ceased 
wishing to do so. The reason for this was that birds of the air mean the knowledge of things, and at this time a perception of that fact was flowing into them. Therefore they refrained from turning 
them into something different and so from turning away the ideas in their memory. After that I was allowed to represent before them a very lovely garden full of lamp-posts and lights. This time they 
did nothing and held back, for the reason that lamp-posts with lights mean truths which shine from good. From this it was evident that they could go on looking at material things provided that at the 
same time the meaning which those things have in the spiritual sense was introduced. For the ideas that belong to the spiritual sense are devoid of material associations. </p>

</p><b>7072.</b>
Postea repraesentabam illis volucres majores et minores, quales in nostra tellure sunt, (x) nam in altera vita repraesentari possunt talia quasi ad vivum, ipsa loquela spirituum et angelorum repraesentationibus 
plena est; cum volucres illas repraesentatas viderent, primum volebant illas mutare, sed dein delectabantur illis, et quiescebant; causa erat quia volucres significant cognitiones rerum, 
cujus rei perceptio quoque tunc influebat; ideo abstinebant ab illis transmutandis, et sic ab ideis memoriae suae avertendis.  {1}Postea repraesentare licebat coram illis amoenissimum hortum plenum lampadibus 
et lucernis; tunc morabantur et detinebantur, ex causa quia lampades cum lucernis significant veritates quae lucent a bono; inde patuit quod {2}teneri potuerint in spectandis materialibus, modo 
simul insinuatur significatio illorum in sensu spirituali; quae enim sensus spiritualis sunt a materialibus abstracta sunt sed repraesentantur in materialibus. 	@1 Postmodum$ 	@2 detineri$ </p>
