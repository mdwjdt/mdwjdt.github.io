<h3 align="center" class="ired">属天的奥秘 第717节</h3>
<h4 align="center"></h4><p><strong>717.</strong>从这些分析还可清楚看出，这里所阐述的主题是人的意愿之物，或他里面的良善和神圣之物，也就是意愿的属性。本节经文说凡洁净的牲畜，他要每样带七对，下节经文同样说每样飞鸟带七对。而前一章19-20节的经文却说，他要带七对，每样一对，即它们成双成对，因为那里阐述的是觉知之物，觉知之物本身并不神圣，而是因着构成意愿的爱而成圣。</p>

<p><strong>[NCE]717.</strong> A further conclusion from all this is that the current passage deals with the things in a person's will, or with a person's good, holy traits, which have to do with the will. The present verse, after all, says that of clean animals Noah was to take seven each, and the next says the same of birds. Verses <a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_717/bible_king-james-version_genesis_7_19-20" target=_top>19-20</a>. of the last chapter, however, said not that he was to take seven each but two each, or pairs, because the subject there was intellectual matters. Things of the intellect are not holy in themselves, although love, which belongs to the will, makes them holy. </p>
<p align="center"><b>Potts(1905-1910) 717</b></p><p><b>717.</b>
It is also evident from all this that the subject here treated of is the things of man's will, or the good and holy things in him which are predicated of the will. For it is said that he should "take 
of the clean beast by sevens;" and the same is said in the following verse concerning the "fowl." But in the preceding chapter (verses 19, 20), it is not said that he should "take by sevens" but by "twos" 
or pairs; because there things of the understanding are treated of, which are not holy in themselves, but are holy from love, which is of the will. </p>

<p align="center"><b>Elliott(1983-1999) 717</b></p><p><b>717.</b>
From these considerations it is also clear that the subject is things belonging to man's will, or the good and holy things in him which are attributes of the will. In this verse it is said that he was 
to take sevens of each clean beast, and in the next verse of each bird similarly. But in verses 19, 20, of the previous chapter it is not said that he was to take sevens but two of each, that is, pairs 
of them, because there the subject was things belonging to the understanding, which in themselves are not holy but are made so by the love which constitutes the will. </p>

<p align="center"><b>Latin(1748-1756) 717</b>
</p><b>717.</b>
Ex his quoque constat quod de voluntariis hominis, seu de ejus bonis et sanctis quae praedicantur de voluntate, agatur; hic enim dicitur quod 'acciperet de bestia munda septena,' et in vers. seq. similiter 
de ave; at in cap. praeced. vers. 19, 20, non dicitur quod acciperet septena, sed 'bina' seu paria, quia ibi de intellectualibus, quae non sancta in se, sed ab amore qui voluntatis, sancta sunt, agitur. </p>
