<h3 align="center" class="ired">属天的奥秘 第9783节</h3>
<h4 align="center"></h4><p><strong>9783.</strong>“使灯常常点着”表来自那里的信，以及通过信来自主的对真理的聪明理解和对良善的智慧洞察。这从“灯”的含义清楚可知，“灯”是指信，以及由此而来的对真理的聪明理解和对良善的智慧洞察（参看<a href="9548.htm">9548</a>节）。“灯”表示信的原因是，从主发出的神性真理就是天堂里的光。这光当被那里的天使，或世人接受时，就像一盏灯；因为它光照心智的各个部分，赋予聪明和智慧。被如此接受的光就是信。不过，要记住：信不是一盏灯，也就是说，不会光照心智，除非它来自仁，因而除非它是仁。信和仁的情况，与真理和良善的一样。正如真理是良善的外在形式，或表现在一个外在形成中以至于在光中显现的良善，信也是仁的外在形式，或表现在一个外在形式中的仁。此外，真理属于信，良善属于仁。因为真理当被相信时，就变成信；良善当被热爱时，就变成仁。被爱的良善和真理本身就是邻舍，对邻舍的爱就是仁。</p>

To cause the lamp to go up continually. That this signifies the consequent faith, and through faith the intelligence of truth and wisdom of good from the Lord, is evident from the signification of a 
"lamp," as being faith and the consequent intelligence of truth and wisdom of good (see n. 9548). That a "lamp" denotes faith, is because the Divine truth that proceeds from the Lord is light in the heavens; 
this light, when received by the angels who are there, or by man, is like a lamp, for it illuminates all things of the mind, and imparts intelligence and wisdom. This light when received is faith. 
But be it known that faith is not a lamp, that is, does not illuminate the mind, unless it is from charity; thus unless it is charity. The case with faith and charity is the same as with truth and 
good; truth is the form of good, that is, it is good so formed as to appear in light. So faith is the form of charity, or charity formed. Moreover, truth pertains to faith, and good to charity; for 
that which is true is believed, and becomes of faith; and that which is good is loved, and becomes of charity. The truth and good itself which are loved are the neighbor, and the love of these is charity. </p>

<p align="center"><b>Elliott(1983-1999) 9783</b></p><p><b>9783.</b>
'To cause a lamp to go up continually' means faith from there, and through that faith an intelligent understanding of truth and a wise discernment of good from the Lord. This is clear from the meaning 
of 'a lamp' as faith, and from this an intelligent understanding of truth and a wise discernment of good, dealt with in <a href="9548.htm">9548</a>. 'A lamp' means faith because Divine Truth emanating from the Lord composes 
the light in heaven. This light when received by the angels there, or by a person in the world, resembles a lamp; for it casts light into all parts of the mind and imparts intelligence and wisdom. 
This light so received is faith. But it should be remembered that faith is not a lamp or that which casts light into the mind unless it is fed by charity, and so unless it is charity. The situation with 
faith and charity is the same as it is with truth and good. Just as truth is the outward form of good, or good embodied in an outward form, enabling it to be seen in light, so faith is the outward 
form of charity, or charity embodied in an outward form. Faith furthermore is that to which truth belongs, and charity is that to which good belongs. For truth, when believed, passes into faith; and good, 
when loved, passes into charity. The good and truth themselves that are loved are the neighbour, and the love of the neighbour is charity.  </p>

</p><b>9783.</b>
`Ad ascendere faciendum lucernam jugiter': quod significet inde fidem, et per illam a Domino intelligentiam veri et sapientiam boni, constat ex significatione `lucernae' quod sit fides ac inde intelligentia 
veri et sapientia boni, de qua n. 9548; quod `lucerna' sit fides, est quia Divinum Verum procedens a Domino est lux in caelis; ea lux recepta ab angelis ibi, aut ab homine, est instar lucernae, 
illuminat enim omnia mentis et dat intelligentiam et sapientiam; lux recepta est fides.  Sed sciendum quod fides non sit lucerna, seu {1} illuminet mentem, nisi illa sit ex charitate, ita nisi illa 
sit charitas; se habet cum fide et charitate sicut cum vero et bono; verum est forma boni seu bonum formatum ut appareat in luce {2}, ita fides est forma charitatis seu formata charitas; ad fidem etiam 
pertinet verum, et ad charitatem bonum; quod enim verum est, id creditur et (x)fit fidei, et quod bonum est, hoc amatur et fit charitatis; ipsum verum et bonum (m)quod amatur est proximus, et amor 
ejus est charitas.(n) @1 i non$ @2 formatum bonum$ </p>
