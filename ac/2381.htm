<h4 align="center"></h4><p><strong>2381.</strong>创世记19:11. 他们又击打房门口的男人，使他们不论老少，都瞎了眼；这些人找门找得很烦躁。<br />“房门口的男人”表借以对仁之善诉诸暴力的理性事物和衍生的教义。“他们又击打，使他们都瞎了眼”表他们充满虚假。“不论老少”表无论细节还是总体。“这些人找门找得很烦躁”表以致他们看不见通向良善的任何真理。</p>

<p align="center"><b>Potts(1905-1910) 2381</b></p><p><b>2381.</b>
Verse 11. And the men who were at the door of the house they smote with blindness, from small even to great; and they labored to find the door. "The men who were at the door of the house," signifies 
things rational and the derivative doctrinals, by which violence is offered to the good of charity; "they smote with blindness," signifies that they were filled with falsities; "from small even to great," 
signifies in particular and in general; "and they labored to find the door," signifies so that they could not see any truth that would lead to good. </p>

<p align="center"><b>Elliott(1983-1999) 2381</b></p><p><b>2381.</b>
Verse 11 And the men who were at the door of the house they struck with blindness, both small and great; and these strove to find the door (janua). </p>
<p>'The men who were at the door of the house' means 
rational concepts and matters of doctrine deriving from these by means of which violence is offered to good stemming from charity. 'They struck with blindness' means they were completely filled with 
falsities. 'Both small and great' means in particular and in general. 'And these strove to find the door' means to the point at which they were unable to see any truth that would lead to good. </p>

Vers.  11.  Et viros, qui januae domus, percusserunt caecitatibus, a parvo usque ad magnum, et laboraverunt ad inveniendum januam. `Viros, qui januae domus' significat rationalis et inde doctrinalia 
per quae vis infertur bono charitatis: `percusserunt caecitatibus' significat quod opplerentur falsitatibus: `a parvo usque ad magnum' significat in particulari et communi: `et laboraverunt ad inveniendum 
januam' significat usque ut non videre possent aliquid verum quod duceret ad bonum. </p>
