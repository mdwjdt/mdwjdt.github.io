<h3 align="center" class="ired">属天的奥秘 第3304节</h3>
<h4 align="center"></h4><p><strong>3304.</strong>“他的手抓住以扫的脚跟”表属世人的良善的最低层，真理以某种能力附着于它。这从“手”、“抓住”和“脚跟”的含义，以及以扫的代表清楚可知：“手”是指能力（参看<a href="878.htm">878</a>节），因为它论及真理（<a href="3091.htm">3091</a>节）；“抓住”是指附着；“脚跟”是指属世人的最低层（参看<a href="259.htm">259</a>节）；“以扫”是指属世人的良善（参看<a href="3302.htm">3302</a>节）。从这些含义明显可知，“他的手抓住以扫的脚跟”表属世人的良善的最低层，真理以某种能力附着于它。<br />至于真理以某种能力附着于属世人最低层的良善，情况是这样：属世层，或属世人在重生时，通过理性人，或经由理性人通过属灵人，在此之前经由属灵人通过属天人，在此之前经由属天人通过神性孕育良善与真理。流注就这样依次进行，从神性开始，通过连续层级逐渐下降，直到终止于属世人的最低层部分，也就是世俗和肉体部分。当最低层的属世人因来自母亲的遗传物而沾染污秽时，真理无法与良善联结，只能以某种能力附着于它。在这些污秽被清除之前，真理也不会与良善联结。这就是为何在人里面孕育的是良善而非真理的原因；因此，婴儿缺乏真理的知识，并且真理不得不通过学习获得，然后与良善联结（参看<a href="1831.htm">1831</a>，<a href="1832.htm">1832</a>节）。这也解释了为何经上说他们在“她腹中相争”，也就是他们争斗（<a href="3289.htm">3289</a>节）。由此可知，自初次孕育时，真理就取代良善，如经上论到取代以扫的雅各：<br />他不是名叫雅各吗？因为他取代了我两次。（创世记<a href="http://39-27.cn/创27.36.htm">27:36</a>）<br />何西阿书：<br />必照雅各所行的惩罚他，按他所做的报应他。他在腹中取代他哥哥。（何西阿书<a href="http://39-27.cn/何12.2.htm">12:2</a>-<a href="http://39-27.cn/何12.3.htm">3</a>）<br />那些专注于历史细节，无法摆脱的人只知道这些和前面的经文只是简单预言了发生在以扫和雅各之间的事，并且这种信念也被下文证实了。但主的圣言具有这样的性质：历史细节遵循自己的顺序，而属于内义的属灵细节也遵循自己的顺序，以致外在人看到历史细节，而内在人看到属灵细节。这二者，即外在人与内在人之间以这种方式存在一种对应关系；这一切通过圣言实现，因为圣言用来联结天与地，如多次所说明的。因此，当有人以神圣的状态阅读圣言时，其在地上的外在人与其在天上的内在人就产生一个联结。</p>

And his hand laid hold on Esau's heel. That this signifies the lowest of the good of the natural to which it adhered with some power, is evident from the signification of "hand," as being power (see 
n. 878; and that it is predicated of truth, n. 3091); from the signification of "laying hold of," as being to adhere; from the signification of "heel," as being the lowest of the natural (see n. 259); 
and from the representation of Esau, as being the good of the natural (see n. 3302). Hence it is evident that "his hand laid hold on Esau's heel" signifies the lowest of the good of the natural to which 
truth adhered with some power.  [2] As regards truth adhering with some power to the lowest good of the natural, the case is this: The natural, or the natural man, when being regenerated, has its 
conception as to good and truth from the rational, or through the rational from the spiritual; through this from the celestial; and through this from the Divine. Thus does the influx follow in succession, 
and beginning from the Divine descends until it terminates in the lowest of the natural, that is, in the worldly and corporeal. When the lowest natural is affected with faults by what is hereditary 
from the mother, truth cannot be united to good, but can only adhere to it with some power; nor is truth united to good until these faults have been driven away. This is the reason why although good 
is indeed born with man, truth is not; and therefore infants are devoid of any knowledge of truth; and truth has to be learned, and afterwards conjoined with good (see n. 1831, 1832). Hence also it 
is said that they "struggled together in the midst of her," that is, they fought (n. 3289). From this it follows that from the first conception truth supplants good, as is said of Jacob in regard to 
Esau: </p>
<p>     Is not he named Jacob? For he hath supplanted me these two times (Gen. 27:36). And in Hosea: </p>
<p>     To visit upon Jacob his ways, according to his doings will he recompense him; in the womb 
he supplanted his brother (Hos. 12:2-3). [3] They who keep the mind solely in the historicals, and who are not able to withdraw it from them, do not know but that these and former passages simply foretell 
the events which came to pass between Esau and Jacob, and this conviction is confirmed also by what follows. But the Word of the Lord is of such a nature that the historicals are in their own 
series, while the spiritual things of the internal sense are in theirs; so that the former may be viewed by the external man, and the latter by the internal man, and that in this way there may be a correspondence 
between the two, namely, between the external man and the internal; and this by means of the Word, for the Word is the union of earth and heaven, as has been frequently shown. Thus in everyone 
who is in a holy state while reading the Word, there is a union of his external man which is on the earth, with his internal man which is in heaven. </p>

<p align="center"><b>Elliott(1983-1999) 3304</b></p><p><b>3304.</b>
'And his hand was grasping Esau's heel' means the lowest level of natural good, to which [truth] clung with some power. This is clear from the meaning of 'the hand' as power, dealt with in <a href="878.htm">878</a>, and as 
having reference to truth, <a href="3091.htm">3091</a>; from the meaning of 'grasping' as clinging to; from the meaning of 'the heel' as the lowest part of the natural, dealt with in <a href="259.htm">259</a>; and from the representation of 'Esau' 
as the good of the natural, dealt with in <a href="3302.htm">3302</a>. From these meanings it is evident that 'his hand was grasping Esau's heel' means the lowest level of natural good, which truth clung to with some power. </p>
<p></p>
<p><b>[2]</b>
The implications of truth clinging with some power to the lowest good of the natural are that when the natural, or the natural man, is being regenerated, the conception of good and truth 
there is from the rational man, that is, from the spiritual man by way of the rational man, prior to this from the celestial man by way of the spiritual man, and prior to this from the Divine by way of 
the celestial man. Thus it is an influx which starts with the Divine and, passing through consecutive degrees, terminates in the lowest part of the natural, that is, in the worldly and bodily part. 
When the lowest natural has been contaminated by what is inherited from the mother, truth is unable to be united to good. It can do no more than cling to it with some power. Nor is truth united to good 
until the contamination has been eliminated. This is the reason why good but not truth is bred within a human being, and why small children therefore are devoid of all knowledge of truth and why truth 
has to be acquired through learning and after that joined to good, see <a href="1831.htm">1831</a>, <a href="1832.htm">1832</a>. This also explains why it is said that they struggled together within her, that is, they conflicted, <a href="3289.htm">3289</a>. Consequently 
when first conceived truth supplants good, as is said regarding Jacob, that he supplanted Esau, </p>
<blockquote>
Does he not call his name Jacob, and he has supplanted me these two times. <a href="http://bible.gospelcom.net/cgi-bin/bible?passage=Gen%2027:36&amp;version=ESV&amp;interface=print&amp;showfn=yes&amp;showxref">Gen 27:36</a>. 
</blockquote>
<p>And in 
Hosea, </p>
<blockquote>
He will make a visitation on Jacob over his ways and requite him according to his deeds; in the womb he supplanted his brother. <a href="http://bible.gospelcom.net/cgi-bin/bible?passage=Hosea%2012:2,%203&amp;version=ESV&amp;interface=print&amp;showfn=yes&amp;showxref">Hosea 12:2, 3</a>. 
</blockquote>

 Those whose attention is fixed solely 
on the historical details and who cannot take it off these know no more than this, that the details contained here, and also those that have gone before [regarding the circumstances of the twins' birth], 
foretell what took place between Esau and Jacob, as is also corroborated by what follows. But the Lord's Word is such that the historical details follow their own sequence, while the spiritual details, 
which belong to the internal sense, follow theirs, so that the historical details are seen by the external man, but the spiritual details by the internal man. This being so a correspondence exists 
between the two, that is to say, between the external man and the internal man; and this is effected by means of the Word, for the Word serves to unite heaven and earth, as shown many times. Thus when 
anyone in a holy frame of mind reads the Word, a union is effected of his external man which is on earth with his internal man which is in heaven. </p>

`Et manus ejus prehendens in calcaneum Esavi': quod significet infimum boni naturalis cui adhaerebat aliqua potentia, constat ex significatione `manus' quod sit potentia, de qua n. 878, et quod praedicetur 
de vero, n. 3091; ex significatione `prehendere' quod sit adhaerere; ex significatione `calcanei' quod sit infimum naturalis, de qua n. 259; et a repraesentatione `Esavi' quod sit bonum naturalis, 
de qua n. 3302; inde patet quod `manus ejus prehendens in calcaneum Esavi' significet infimum boni naturalis cui verum adhaerebat aliqua potentia. [2] Cum hoc, quod verum adhaeserit infimo bono naturalis 
aliqua potentia, ita se habet: naturale seu naturalis homo cum regeneratur, conceptionem suam quoad bonum et verum habet a rationali seu per rationalem a spirituali, per hunc a caelesti, et per 
hunc a Divino; ita succedit influxus qui a Divino incohans ac ita succedens terminatur in naturalis infimo, hoc est, in mundano et corporeo; cum naturale infimum vitio affectum est per hereditarium 
a matre, tunc non potest bono uniri verum, sed modo ei adhaerere aliqua potentia, nec prius bono unitur verum quam cum vitium illud abactum est; quae causa est quod quidem bonum connascatur homini: non 
autem verum, ideo infantes absque omni cognitione veri sunt {1}et quod addiscendum (t)verum sit , et {2}dein conjungendum bono videatur n. 1831, 1832; {3}quapropter etiam dicitur quod colliserint se 
{4}in medio ejus, hoc est, pugnaverint, n. 3289; inde est quod a prima conceptione verum supplantet bonum, {5}sicut dicitur de Jacobo quod Esavum,           Num quod vocat nomen illius Jacob et supplantavit 
me his      duabus vicibus, Gen. xxvii 36: </p>
<p>et apud Hosheam,           Ad visitandum super Jacobum vias ejus, secundum opera      ejus retribuet ei, in utero supplantavit fratrem suum, xii 
3,      4 [A.V. 2, 3]. [3] Qui in historicis solum mentem tenent nec eam amovere inde possunt, non aliud sciunt quam quod haec, et quae praecedunt, praenuntient illa quae evenerunt inter Esavum et 
Jacobum, de quibus a sequentibus etiam confirmantur; sed tale est Verbum Domini quod historica in sua serie sint, et {6}spiritualia, quae sunt sensus interni, in sua, ut illa spectentur ab externo homine, 
{7}haec autem ab interno, et sic sit inter utrumque, nempe externum hominem et internum, correspondentia; et hoc per Verbum, Verbum enim {8}est unio terrae et caeli, ut pluries ostensum; ita in 
unoquovis qui in sancto est cum legit Verbum, est unio externi ejus hominis qui est in terra, cum interno ejus qui est in caelo. @1 sed$  @2 sic$  @3 ideo$  @4 after pugnaverint$  @5 et a supplantatione
