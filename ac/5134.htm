<h3 align="center" class="ired">属天的奥秘 第5134节</h3>
<h4 align="center"></h4><p><strong>5134.</strong>“救我出这牢房”表从邪恶当中解救出来。这从“救出”和“房”的含义清楚可知：“救出”是指解救；“房”是指良善（参看<a href="710.htm">710</a>，<a href="1708.htm">1708</a>，<a href="2048.htm">2048</a>，<a href="2233.htm">2233</a>，<a href="3128.htm">3128</a>，<a href="3652.htm">3652</a>，<a href="3720.htm">3720</a>，<a href="4982.htm">4982</a>节），因而在反面意义上是指邪恶。由此明显可知，“救我出这牢房”表示从邪恶当中解救出来，这个意思也遵循前面的思路，即：当信仰在外层属世层里面被接受（这就是此处的主题，参看<a href="5130.htm">5130</a>节）时，对应关系就得以实现（<a href="5131.htm">5131</a>节）；当仁爱被接受（<a href="5132.htm">5132</a>节），与内层属世层的交流由此得以实现（<a href="5133.htm">5133</a>节），外层属世层此时就从使得“约瑟”所代表的属天层（<a href="5086.htm">5086</a>，<a href="5087.htm">5087</a>，<a href="5106.htm">5106</a>节）变得疏远的邪恶当中被解救出来；这种疏远由接下来的话，即他“被拐”来表示。此外，当属世层正通过仁与信重生时，它就从邪恶当中被解救出来；因为当它重生时，邪恶就被分开，从它们以前所在的中心被逐出，被赶到源于良善的真理之光触及不到的周边。对人来说，邪恶以这种方式被分开，然而仍旧存在，因为它们无法被完全摧毁。但对主来说，祂已在自己里面将属世层变得神性，故邪恶与虚假被完全逐出并摧毁。因为神性与邪恶并虚假毫无共同之处，也不可能像人那样被它们包围；事实上，神性是良善与真理的本质存在，这存在无限远离邪恶与虚假。</p>

<p align="center"><b>Potts(1905-1910) 5134</b></p><p><b>5134.</b>
And bring me out of this house. That this signifies deliverance from evils, is evident from the signification of "bringing out," as being deliverance; and from the signification of a "house," as being 
good (see n. 710, 1708, 2048, 2233, 3128, 3652, 3720, 4982); and therefore in the opposite sense, evil. Hence it is plain that deliverance from evils is signified by the words, "bring me out of this 
house," and this also follows in its order from the things which precede. When faith is received in the exterior natural (which is here treated of, see n. 5130), correspondence is effected (n. 5131), 
and charity is received (n. 5132), and thus communication is effected with the interior natural (n. 5133), which is then delivered from the evils whereby the celestial represented by Joseph (n. 5086, 
5087, 5106) was alienated; which alienation is signified by his being "carried off by theft," as presently follows. Moreover, when the natural is being regenerated by means of charity and faith, it is 
delivered from evils; for evils are then separated, and are cast out from the center where they were before, to the circumferences, whither the light of truth from good does not reach. In this way are 
evils separated in man, and yet are retained, for they cannot be entirely destroyed. But with the Lord, who made the natural in Himself Divine, evils and falsities were utterly cast out and destroyed; 
for the Divine can have nothing in common with evils and falsities, nor be terminated in them, as is the case with man; for the Divine is the very being of good and of truth, which is infinitely removed 
from what is evil and false. </p>

'And bring me out of this house' means a release from evils. This is clear from the meaning of 'bringing out' as a release, and from the meaning of 'house' as good, dealt with in <a href="710.htm">710</a>, <a href="1708.htm">1708</a>, <a href="2048.htm">2048</a>, <a href="2233.htm">2233</a>, <a href="3128.htm">3128</a>, <a href="3652.htm">3652</a>, <a href="3720.htm">3720</a>, <a href="4982.htm">4982</a>, and therefore, in the contrary sense, as evil. From this it is evident that 'bring me out of this house' means a release from evils, a meaning that also follows the preceding 
train of thought, which is this: When faith is received within the exterior natural, which is the subject here, <a href="5130.htm">5130</a>, a correspondence is effected, <a href="5131.htm">5131</a>, and when charity is received, <a href="5132.htm">5132</a>, and a communication 
is thereby effected with the interior natural, <a href="5133.htm">5133</a>, the exterior natural is at that point released from the evils which had caused the celestial represented by 'Joseph', <a href="5086.htm">5086</a>, <a href="5087.htm">5087</a>, <a href="5106.htm">5106</a>, 
to become alienated - that alienation being meant by the words which follow next, stating that he was taken away by theft. Furthermore, when the natural is regenerated by means of charity and faith it 
is released from evils; for when it is regenerated the evils are set apart and cast away from the centre, where they were previously, to the fringes, which the light of truth from good does not reach. 
In man's case evils are set apart in this manner; yet they still remain, for they cannot be completely destroyed. But with the Lord, who made the natural within Himself Divine, evils and falsities 
were cast out and completely destroyed. For the Divine cannot have anything at all in common with evils and falsities, or be encompassed by them, as is the case with man; for the Divine is the Essential 
Being (Esse) of good and truth, and that Being exists an infinite distance away from everything evil and false.  </p>

</p><b>5134.</b>
`Et educas me e domo hac': quod significet liberationem a malis, constat ex significatione `educere' quod sit liberatio; et a significatione `domus' quod sit bonum, de qua n. 710, 1708, 2048, 2233, 
3128, 3652, 3720, 4982, quare in opposito sensu est malum; </p>
<p>inde patet quod per `educas me e domo hac' significetur liberatio a malis; sequitur etiam hoc in suo ordine ab illis quae praecedunt; </p>
<p>quando 
in naturali exteriore, de quo hic agitur, recipitur fides, n. 5130, fit correspondentia, n. 5131, et recipitur charitas, n. 5132, et sic communicatio fit cum interiore naturali, n. 5133, tunc liberatur 
illud a malis, per quae caeleste quod per `Josephum' repraesentatur, n. 5086, 5087, 5106, abalienatum est, quae abalienatio significatur per quod `furto auferendo ablatus sit', ut mox sequitur; 
et quoque cum regeneratur naturale per charitatem et fidem, tunc liberatur id' a malis, mala enim tunc {1} separantur et conjiciuntur e centro ubi prius fuerunt, ad peripherias quo lux veri 
a bono non pertingit; apud hominem separantur ita mala sed usque retinentur, nam prorsus deleri nequeunt; at apud Dominum Qui naturale in Se Divinum fecit, mala et falsa prorsus ejecta et deleta sunt, 
Divinum enim nihil commune potest habere cum malis (o)et falsis, nec terminari in illis, sicut fit apud hominem, nam Divinum est ipsum Esse boni et veri, quod infinite distat abalienatum a malo 
et falso. @1 i ibi$ </p>
