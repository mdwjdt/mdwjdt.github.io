<h3 align="center" class="ired">属天的奥秘 第6210节</h3>
<h4 align="center"></h4><p><strong>6210.</strong>我有时会深入思考世俗事物和大多数人所关切的那些事，即财产、财富的获得、娱乐等等。在这些时候，我注意到，我正在陷入感官之物；并且我的思维沉浸于这类世俗事物到何等程度，我就远离天使的陪伴到何等程度。这也向我证明，那些沉迷于这类关切的人与那些在来世的人没有任何真正的接触。因为当这类思维占据整个心智时，它们就会向下压迫心智的低层部分，就像重物把它拖拽下来一样。当这些世俗事物被视为目的时，它们就会把此人从天堂那里移走；他若不通过爱与信之良善，就无法被提升至天堂。这一点通过下面的经历向我更加显明了：我曾被带到天堂的居所，当时处于属灵的观念；然后，我突然开始思考世俗事物；于是，所有这些属灵观念就都消散，化为乌有。</p>

It has sometimes happened that I was earnestly thinking about worldly things, and about such things as give great concern to most persons, namely, about possessions, the acquirement of riches, about 
pleasures, and the like. At these times I noticed that I was sinking down into what is sensuous and that in proportion as my thought was immersed in such things, I was removed from the company of the 
angels. By this it was also made plain to me that they who are deeply immersed in such cares cannot have interaction with those who are in the other life. For when such thoughts possess the whole of the 
mind, they carry the lower mind downward, and are like weights which drag it down; and when they are regarded as the end, they remove the man from heaven, to which he cannot be elevated except by means 
of the good of love and of faith. This was made still more manifest to me from the fact that once when I was led through the abodes of heaven, and was at the time in a spiritual idea, it happened 
that I suddenly began to sink into thought about worldly things, and then all that spiritual idea was dissipated and became as naught. </p>

On some occasions I have happened to be deep in thought about worldly matters and the kinds of things that concern most people - possessions, the acquisition of riches, pleasures, and the like. At these 
times I noticed that I was slipping back into sensory-mindedness, and that to the extent that my thought was immersed in those worldly interests I was more removed from companionship with the angels. 
This also proved to me that people who are deeply engrossed in such concerns cannot have any real contact with them in the next life. For when such thoughts occupy the whole mind they bear its lower 
part downwards, like weights pulling it down. When such worldly interests are a person's final concern they remove him from heaven, to which he cannot be raised except by means of the good of love 
and faith. This has been made additionally clear to me by the following experience. I was once taken through the dwelling-places of heaven, at which time my ideas were spiritual ones. Then I suddenly 
slipped into thinking about worldly matters, and all those spiritual ideas were scattered and became as nothing. </p>

</p><b>6210.</b>
Aliquibus vicibus factum quod impense cogitarem de mundanis  et de talibus quae curae sunt plerisque, nempe de possessionibus, de acquisitione divitiarum, de voluptatibus, et similibus; tunc animadverti 
quod in sensuale relaberer, et quod in tantum quantum illis immergeretur cogitatio, removerer a consortio cum angelis; inde mihi quoque patuit quod qui in talibus curis profunde sunt, nequeant commercium 
habere cum illis in altera vita; cogitationes enim tales, cum occupant totam mentem, deorsum ferunt animum et sunt sicut pondera quae detrahunt; et cum pro fine habentur, removent a caelo, ad 
quod elevari homo nequit nisi per bonum amoris et fidei.  Hoc adhuc mihi constare potuit ex eo; quondam cum ductus sum per mansiones caeli, et tunc in spirituali idea essem, et accidit quod subito lapsus 
essem in cogitationem de mundanis, et tunc omnis illa idea spiritualis dissipabatur et facta sicut nulla.   </p>
