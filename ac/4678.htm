<h4 align="center"></h4><p><strong>4678.</strong>创世记37:4-11.约瑟的哥哥们看见父亲爱约瑟过于爱他的众弟兄，就恨约瑟，不与他说和睦的话。约瑟作了一梦，告诉他哥哥们，他们就越发恨他。约瑟对他们说，请听我所作的这个梦；看哪，我们在田中间捆禾稼，我的捆起来站着，看哪，你们的捆来围着向我的捆下拜。他的哥哥们对他说，难道你真要作我们的王吗？难道你真要管辖我们吗？他们就因为他的梦和他的话，越发恨他。他又作了一梦，也告诉他的哥哥们说，看哪，我又作了一梦，看哪，太阳、月亮和十一颗星向我下拜。约瑟将这梦告诉他父亲和他哥哥们，他父亲就责备他，对他说，你作的这是什么梦！难道我和你母亲、你弟兄果然要来俯伏在地，向你下拜吗？他哥哥们都嫉妒他，他父亲却把这话存在心里。<br />“约瑟的哥哥们看见”表那些属于信的事物，在最近似意义上表雅各的后代。“父亲爱约瑟过于爱他的众弟兄”表它（即主的神性属灵层或神性真理）与神性属世层联结，在近似意义上表与“父亲”所表示的古教会联结。“就恨约瑟，不与他说和睦的话”表蔑视和憎恶。“约瑟作了一梦”表关于神性人身或祂自己的宣告。“告诉他哥哥们”表当着那些持分离之信之人的面，或对着持守与仁分离之信的信徒。“他们就越发恨他”表更大的蔑视和憎恶。“约瑟对他们说，请听我所作的这个梦”表宣告的内容。“看哪，我们在田中间捆禾稼”表他们根据教义教导人。“我的捆起来站着”表关于主的神性人身的教义。“看哪，你们的捆来围着”表那些处于信仰的人。“向我的捆下拜”表敬拜。“他的哥哥们对他说”表持守（与仁）分离之信的信徒。“难道你真要作我们的王吗？难道你真要管辖我们吗”表理解的事物和意愿的事物真的要服从它吗？“他们就因为他的梦和他的话，越发恨他”表由于真理或圣言的宣告而引发的还要更大的蔑视和憎恶。“他又作了一梦”表进一步的宣告。“也告诉他的哥哥们说”表当着那些持守与仁分离之信的信徒的面。“看哪，我又作了一梦”表内容。“看哪，太阳、月亮”表属世良善和属世真理。“和十一颗星”表对良善与真理的认知。“向我下拜”表敬拜。“约瑟将这梦告诉他父亲和他哥哥们”表被赋予知道它。“他父亲就责备他，对他说，你作的这是什么梦”表愤慨，“父亲”在此是指来源于古代宗教的犹太教。“难道我和你母亲、你弟兄果然要来俯伏在地，向你下拜吗”表示这个教会是否要敬拜，或这个教会会来敬拜吗？“他哥哥们都嫉妒他”表他们的憎恶。“他父亲却把这话存在心里”表这真理仍存留在他们的宗教表象中。</p>

Verses 4-11. And his brethren saw that their father loved him more than all his brethren; and they hated him, and could not speak for peace unto him. And Joseph dreamed a dream, and he told it to his 
brethren, and they added yet to hate him. And he said unto them, Hear I pray this dream which I have dreamed; and behold we were binding sheaves in the midst of the field, and lo my sheaf arose, and 
also stood upright; and behold your sheaves came round about, and bowed down themselves to my sheaf. And his brethren said to him, Shalt thou indeed reign over us? Or shalt thou indeed have dominion over 
us? And they added yet to hate him for his dreams, and for his words. And he dreamed yet another dream, and told it to his brethren, and said, Behold I have dreamed yet a dream, and behold the sun 
and the moon and eleven stars bowed down themselves to me. And he told it to his father, and to his brethren; and his father rebuked him, and said to him, What is this dream that thou hast dreamed? Shall 
I and thy mother and thy brethren indeed come to bow down ourselves to thee to the earth? And his brethren envied him, but his father kept the word. "And his brethren saw," signifies those things 
which are of faith, and in the proximate sense the posterity of Jacob; "that their father loved him more than all his brethren," signifies that it was conjoined with the Divine natural, and in the proximate 
sense with the ancient church, which is the "father;" "and they hated him, and could not speak for peace unto him," signifies contempt and aversion; "and Joseph dreamed a dream," signifies preaching 
concerning the Divine human; "and he told it to his brethren," signifies in the presence of those who are of faith separate; "and they added yet to hate him," signifies still greater contempt and 
aversion; "and he said unto them, Hear I pray this dream which I have dreamed," signifies the contents of the preaching; "and behold we were binding sheaves in the midst of the field," signifies that 
they were teaching from doctrine; "and lo my sheaf arose, and also stood upright," signifies what is doctrinal concerning the Lord's Divine Human; "and behold your sheaves came round about," signifies 
those who were in faith; "and bowed down themselves to my sheaf," signifies adoration; "and his brethren said to him," signifies those who are of faith separate; "shalt thou indeed reign over us? 
Or shalt thou indeed have dominion over us?" signifies were they to be subject as to the things of the understanding and of the will; "and they added yet to hate him for his dreams and for his words," 
signifies still greater contempt and aversion because of the preaching of the Word; "and he dreamed yet another dream," signifies again a preaching; "and told it to his brethren, and said," signifies 
in the presence of those who are of faith separate; "behold I have dreamed yet a dream," signifies the contents; "and behold the sun and the moon," signifies natural good and natural truth; "and eleven 
stars," signifies the knowledges of good and of truth; "bowed down themselves to me," signifies adoration; "and he told it to his father and to his brethren," signifies that it was given to know it; 
"and his father rebuked him, and said unto him, What is this dream that thou hast dreamed?" signifies indignation; "father" here is the Jewish religion derived from the ancient; "shall I and thy mother 
and thy brethren indeed come to bow down ourselves to thee to the earth?" signifies whether the church will adore; "and his brethren envied him," signifies their aversion; "and his father kept the 
word," signifies that the truth remained in their religiosity. </p>

Verses 4-11 And his brothers saw that their father loved him more than all his brothers, and they hated him, and could not speak peaceably to him. And Joseph dreamed a dream, and he told it to his brothers; 
and they hated him all the more.<A name="fntext1"></a><A href="#fn1"><sup>a</sup></a> And he said to them, Hear now this dream which I have dreamed. Behold, we were binding sheaves in the middle of the field, and behold, my sheaf arose and also 
stood up, and behold, your sheaves gathered round it and bowed down to my sheaf. And his brothers said to him, Are you indeed going to reign over us? Or are you indeed going to have dominion over us? 
And they hated him all the more<A name="fntext1"></a><A href="#fn1"><sup>a</sup></a> for his dreams and for his words. And he dreamed yet another dream, and he recounted it to his brothers, and said, Behold, I have dreamed a dream again, and behold, the 
sun and the moon, and the eleven stars were bowing down to me. And he recounted it to his father and to his brothers; and his father rebuked him and said to him, What is this dream that you have dreamed? 
Shall we indeed come - I and your mother, and your brothers - to bow down to you to the earth? And his brothers envied him; and his father kept the matter<A name="fntext2"></a><A href="#fn2"><sup>b</sup></a> [in mind]. </p>
<p>'His brothers saw' means 
things that are matters of faith - in the proximate sense, the descendants of Jacob. 'That their father loved him more than all his brothers' means that [the Lord's Divine Spiritual or Divine Truth] 
was joined to the Divine Natural - in the proximate sense, to the Ancient Church meant by 'father'. 'And they hated him, and could not speak peaceably to him' means contempt and aversion. 'And Joseph 
dreamed a dream' means a declaration concerning Himself. 'And he told it to his brothers' means to the adherents to faith separated from charity. 'And they hated him all the more' means still greater 
contempt and aversion. 'And he said to them, Hear now this dream which I have dreamed' means the contents of the declaration. 'Behold, we were binding sheaves in the middle of the field' means that 
they were teaching from doctrine. 'And behold, my sheaf arose and also stood up' means teaching concerning the Lord's Divine Human. 'And behold, your sheaves gathered round it' means those who were governed 
by faith. 'And bowed down to my sheaf' means worship. 'And his brothers said to him' means the adherents to faith separated from charity. 'Are you indeed going to reign over us? Or are you indeed 
going to have dominion over us?' means, Were the concepts in their understandings and the desires in their wills to be made subject to it? 'And they hated him all the more for his dreams and for his 
words' means still greater contempt and aversion on account of that declaration of truth. 'And he dreamed yet another dream' means a further declaration. 'And he recounted it to his brothers, and said' 
means to the adherents to faith separated from charity. 'Behold, I have dreamed a dream again' means the contents. 'And behold, the sun and the moon' means natural good and natural truth. 'And the 
eleven stars' means cognitions of good and truth. 'Were bowing down to me' means worship. 'And he recounted it to his father and to his brothers' means being given to know it. 'And his father rebuked 
him and said to him, What is this dream that you have dreamed?' means indignation, 'father' at this point being the Jewish religion, an offspring of ancient religion. 'Shall we indeed come - I and your 
mother, and your brothers - to bow down to you to the earth?' means, Will the Church come to worship? 'And his brothers envied him' means their aversion. 'And his father kept the matter [in mind]' 
means that truth remained within their semblance of religion.

Vers. 4-11.  Et viderunt fratres ejus, quod eum amavit pater illorum prae omnibus fratribus ejus, et oderunt eum, et non potuerunt loqui ei ad pacem.  Et somniant Joseph somnium, et indicavit fratribus 
suis, et addiderunt adhuc odisse eum.  Et dixit ad illos, Audite quaeso somnium hoc quod somniavi.  Et ecce nos manipulantes manipulos in medio agri, et ecce surrexit manipulus meus, et etiam 
constitit et ecce circumdederunt manipuli vestri, et incurvaverunt se manipulo meo.  Et dixerunt ei fratres ejus, An regnando regnabis super nos? si dominando dominaberis in nos?  et addiderunt adhuc 
odisse eum super somnia ejus, et super verba ejus.  Et somniavit adhuc somnium alterum, et narravit illud fratribus sui, et dixit, Ecce somniavi somnium adhuc, et ecce sol et luna, et undecim 
stellae incurvantes se mihi.  Et narravit ad patrem suum, et ad fratres suos; et increpavit eum pater ejus, et dixit ei, Quid somnium hoc quod somniasti? an veniendo veniemus ego et mater tua, et fratres 
tui, ad incurvandum nos tibi terram?  Et inviderunt ei fratres ejus; et pater ejus custodivit verbum.  `Viderunt fratres ejus' significat illa quae sunt fidei; in sensu proximo, posteros Jacobi: 
`quod eum amavit pater illorum prae omnibus fratribus ejus' significat quod conjunctus cum Divino Naturali; in sensu proximo, cum Antiqua Ecclesia quae est `pater': `et oderunt eum, et non potuerant 
loqui ei ad pacem significat contemptum et aversionem {1}: `et somniavit Joseph somnium' significat praedicationem de Ipso: `et indicavit fratribus suis' significat coram illis qui a fide separata: 
`et addiderunt adhuc odisse eum' significat contemptum et aversionem adhuc majorem: `et dixit ad illos, Audite quaeso somnium hoc quod somniavi' significat praedicationis contenta: `et ecce 
nos manipulantes manipulos in medio agri' significat docentes e doctrina: `et ecce surrexit manipulus meus et etiam constitit' significat doctrinale de Domini Divino Humano: `et ecce circumdederunt 
manipuli vestri' significat illos qui in fide essent: `et incurvaverunt se manipulo meo' significat adorationem: </p>
<p>`et dixerunt ei fratres ejus' significat illos qui a fide separata: </p>
<p>`an regnando regnabis 
super nos ? si dominando dominaberis in nos?' significat num quoad intellectualia et voluntaria subjecti essent?: </p>
<p>`et addiderunt adhuc odisse eum super somnia ejus et super verba ejus' significat 
contemptum et aversionem {2} adhuc majorem propter praedicationem veri {3}: `et somniavit adhuc somnium alterum' significat iterum praedicationem: `et narravit illud fratribus suis, et dixit' 
significat coram illis qui a fide separata: `Ecce somniavi somnium adhuc' significat contenta: `et ecce sol et luna' significat bonum naturale et verum naturale: `et undecim stellae' significat cognitiones 
boni et veri: `incurvantes se mihi' significat adorationem: `et narravit ad patrem suum, et ad fratres suos' significat quod datum scire id: `et increpavit eum pater ejus, et dixit ei, Quid 
somnium hoc quod somniasti? significat indignationem; `pater' hic est religio Judaica ex Antiqua: `an veniendo veniemus ego et mater tua, et fratres tui, ad incurvandum nos tibi terram?' significat 
num adoratura Ecclesia?: `et inviderunt ei fratres ejus' significat aversionem illorum: `et pater ejus custodivit verbum' significat quod maneret veritas in religioso eorum.      @1 A here alters
