<h4 align="center"></h4><p><strong>5.</strong>若非出于主，人不可能了解这些。所以，我有必要预先声明，因主的慈悲，我被允许与精灵及天使来往，听他们谈论，与他们交流，迄今已有多年，从未间断。就这样，我在灵界（in the other life）耳闻目睹了许多奇妙的事物，都是此前人未曾知道或想到的，包括精灵的各种类型，人死后的状态，无信之人在地狱的悲惨境遇，忠信之人在天堂的幸福感受，特别是整个天堂所认同的信仰教义。因主的慈悲，下面我会就这些话题作详细的阐述。</p>

<p><strong>[NCE]5.</strong> But without the Lord's aid not a soul can possibly see that this is the case. As a result, it is proper to reveal in these preliminaries that the Lord in his divine mercy has granted me the opportunity for several years now, without break or interruption, to keep company with spirits and angels, to hear them talking, and to speak with them in turn.{*1} Consequently I have been able to see and hear the most amazing things in the other life, which have never before come into people's awareness or thought.<br />In that world I have been taught about the different kinds of spirits, the situation of souls after death, hell (or the regrettable state of the faithless), and heaven (or the blissful state of the faithful). In particular I have learned what is taught in the faith acknowledged by the whole of heaven. All of these topics will, with the Lord's divine mercy, be explored further in what follows. </p>
<p align="center"><b>Potts(1905-1910) 5</b></p><p><b>5.</b>
That this is really the case no one can possibly know except from the Lord. It may therefore be stated in advance that of the Lord's Divine mercy it has been granted me now for some years to be constantly 
and uninterruptedly in company with spirits and angels, hearing them speak and in turn speaking with them. In this way it has been given me to hear and see wonderful things in the other life which 
have never before come to the knowledge of any man, nor into his idea. I have been instructed in regard to the different kinds of spirits; the state of souls after death; hell, or the lamentable state 
of the unfaithful; heaven, or the blessed state of the faithful; and especially in regard to the doctrine of faith which is acknowledged in the universal heaven; on which subjects, of the Lord's Divine 
mercy, more will be said in the following pages. </p>
<p>     CHAPTER 1* </p>
<p>     1. In the beginning God created the heavens and the earth.      2. And the earth was a void and emptiness, and thick 
darkness was upon the faces of the deep. And the Spirit of God moved upon the faces of the waters.      3. And God said, Let there be light, and there was light.      4. And God saw the light, that 
it was good; and God distinguished between the light and the darkness.      5. And God called the light day, and the darkness He called night. And the evening and the morning were the first day.    
  6. And God said, Let there be an expanse in the midst of the waters, and let it distinguish between the waters in the waters.      7. And God made the expanse, and made a distinction between the waters 
which were under the expanse, and the waters which were above the expanse; and it was so.      8. And God called the expanse heaven. And the evening and the morning were the second day.      9. 
And God said, Let the waters under the heaven be gathered together in one place, and let the dry [land] appear; and it was so.      10. And God called the dry [land] earth, and the gathering together 
of the waters called He seas; and God saw that it was good.      11. And God said, Let the earth bring forth the tender herb, the herb yielding seed, and the fruit tree bearing fruit after its kind, 
whose seed is in itself, upon the earth; and it was so.      12. And the earth brought forth the tender herb, the herb yielding seed after its kind, and the tree bearing fruit, whose seed was in itself, 
after its kind; and God saw that it was good.      13. And the evening and the morning were the third day.      14. And God said, Let there be luminaries in the expanse of the heavens, to distinguish 
between the day and the night; and let them be for signs, and for seasons, and for days, and for years.      15. And let them be for luminaries in the expanse of the heavens, to give light upon 
the earth; and it was so.      16. And God made two great luminaries, the greater luminary to rule by day, and the lesser luminary to rule by night; and the stars.      17. And God set them in the 
expanse of the heavens, to give light upon the earth; </p>
<p>     18. And to rule in the day, and in the night, and to distinguish between the light and the darkness; and God saw that it was good.      19. 
And the evening and the morning were the fourth day.      20. And God said, Let the waters cause to creep forth the creeping thing, the living soul; and let fowl fly above the earth upon the faces 
of the expanse of the heavens.      21. And God created great whales, and every living soul that creepeth, which the waters caused to creep forth after their kinds, and every winged fowl after its kind; 
and God saw that it was good.      22. And God blessed them, saying, Be fruitful and multiply, and fill the waters in the seas, and the fowl shall be multiplied in the earth.      23. And the evening 
and the morning were the fifth day.      24. And God said, Let the earth bring forth the living soul after its kind; the beast, and the thing moving itself, and the wild animal of the earth, after 
its kind; and it was so.      25. And God made the wild animal of the earth after its kind, and the beast after its kind, and everything that creepeth on the ground after its kind; and God saw that 
it was good.       26. And God said, Let us make man in our image, after our likeness; and let them have dominion over the fish of the sea, and over the fowl of the heavens, and over the beast, and 
over all the earth, and over every creeping thing that creepeth upon the earth.      27. And God created man in His own image, in the image of God created He him; male and female created He them.  
    28. And God blessed them, and God said unto them, Be fruitful, and multiply, and replenish the earth, and subdue it; and have dominion over the fish of the sea, and over the fowl of the heavens, 
and over every living thing that creepeth upon the earth.      29. And God said, Behold, I give you every herb bearing seed which is upon the faces of all the earth, and every tree in which is fruit; 
the tree yielding seed, to you it shall be for food.      30. And to every wild animal of the earth, and to every fowl of the heavens, and to everything that creepeth upon the earth wherein is a living 
soul, every green herb for food; and it was so. 31. And God saw everything that He had made, and behold it was very good. And the evening and the morning were the sixth day. *  The Author, writing 
in Latin, has given his own translation, in that language, of the Hebrew and Greek texts of the Word, in which, for the sake of the spiritual sense, he has rendered the originals almost as literally 
as possible, and it has been deemed necessary to follow him in the translation of the present work into English, but with the endeavor to avoid any needless departure from the language of the English 
Bible. [Reviser.] </p>

But unless he has it from the Lord no human being can possibly know that this is the situation. By way of introductory remarks therefore it can be disclosed that in the Lord's Divine mercy I have been 
allowed constantly and without interruption for several years now to share the experiences of spirits and angels, to listen to them speaking and to speak to them myself. I have been allowed therefore 
to hear and see astounding things in the next life which have never come to any man's knowledge, nor even entered his imagination In that world I have learned about different kinds of spirits, about 
the state of souls after death, about hell (the miserable state of people who do not have faith), about heaven (the very happy state of those who do have faith), and above all else about the doctrine 
of the faith that is acknowledged in the whole of heaven. In the Lord's Divine mercy more will be told about these matters in what follows.    <h3>GENESIS 1</h3>

Sed quod ita se res habeat, nemo mortalium usquam scire potest nisi ex Domino; quare in antecessum licet manifestare quod ex Divina Domini Misericordia concessum sit nunc per aliquot annos jugiter et

<p>                         CAPUT PRIMUM 	1. In principio creavit 
Deus{1} caelum et terram. 	@1 In both A and I we find Jehovah and Deus in capitals in the complete chapters from The Word, but in ordinary type in the succeeding explanatory portions of the work.$ 	2. 
Et terra erat vacuitas et inanitas, et caligo super faciebus abyssi; et Spiritus DEI se motitans super facies aquarum. 	3. Et dixit DEUS, Sit lux, et facta est lux. 	4. Et vidit DEUS lucem, quod 
bona; et distinxit Deus inter lucem et inter tenebras. 	5. Et vocavit DEUS lucem, diem; et tenebras vocavit noctem Et fuit vespera, et fuit mane, dies primus. 	6. Et dixit DEUS, Sit expansum in medio 
aquarum, et sit distinguens inter aquas aquis. 	7. Et fecit DEUS expansum illud, et distinxit inter aquas, qua- sub expanso, et inter aquas, quae supra expansum; et factum ita. 	8. Et vocavit DEUS 
expansum, caelum. Et fuit vespera, et tui mane, dies secundus. 	9. Et dixit DEUS, Congregentur aquae sub caelo ad locum unum et appareat arida; et factum ita. 	10. Et vocavit DEUS aridam, terram, 
et congregationem aquarum vocavit maria: et vidit DEUS quod bonum. 	11. Et dixit DEUS, Progerminare faciat terra herbam teneram, herbam seminificantem semen, arborem fructus facientem fructum secundum 
speciem suam, in quo semen ejus, super terra; et factum ita. 	12. Et produxit terra herbam teneram, herbam seminificantem semen, secundum speciem suam, et arborem facientem fructum, in quo semen ejus, 
secundum speciem suam; et vidit DEUS quod bonum 	13. Et fuit vespera, et fuit mane, dies tertius. 	14. Et dixit DEUS, Sit luminaria in expanso caelorum, ad distinguendum inter diem, et inter noctem; 
et erunt in signa, et in stata tempora, et in dies, et annos. 	15. Et erunt in luminaria in expanso caelorum, ad lucem dandum super terra; et factum ita. 	16.  Et fecit DEUS duo luminaria magna, 
luminare magnum ac dominandum die, et luminare minus ad dominandum nocte, et stellas 	17. Et posuit illa DEUS in expanso caelorum, ad lucem dandum super terra; </p>
<p>	18.  Et ad dominandum in die, et in 
nocte, et ad distinguendum inter lucem, et inter tenebras; et vidit DEUS quod bonum. 	19.  Et fuit vespera, et fiat mane, dies quartus. 	20.  Et dixit DEUS, Prorepere faciant aquae reptile, animam 
viventem; et avis volitet super terra, super faciebus expansi caelorum. 	21.  Et creavit DEUS cetos magnos; et omnem animam viventem reptantem, quam prorepere fecerunt aquae, secundum species suas; 
et omnem avem alae secundum speciem suam; et vidit Deus quod bonum. 	22.  Et benedixit iis DEUS, dicendo, Fructificate et multiplicate vos, et implete aquas in maribus; et avis multiplicabitur in terra. 	23. 
 Et fuit vespera, et fuit mane, dies quintus. 	24.  Et dixit DEUS, Producat terra animam viventem secundum speciem suam; bestiam et se movens, et feram istius terrae secundum speciem suam; 
et factum ita. 	25.  Et fecit DEUS feram terrae secundum speciem suam; et bestiam secundum speciem suam, et omne reptans humi secundum speciem suam; et vidit DEUS quod bonum. 	26.  Et dixit DEUS, Faciamus 
hominem in imaginem Nostram, secundum similitudinem Nostram; et dominabuntur in pisces maris, et in avem caelorum, et in bestiam, et in omnem terram, et in omne reptans, quod reptat super terra. 	27. 
 Et creavit DEUS hominem in imaginem Ipsius, in imaginem DeI creavit illum; masculum et feminam creavit illos. 	28.  Et benedixit illis Deus, et dixit illis DEUS, Fructificate et multiplicate 
vos, et implete terram, et subjugate eam; et dominamini in pisces maris, et in avem caelorum, et in omne vivum reptans super terra. 	29.  Et dixit DEUS, Ecce, do vobis omnem herbam seminificantem semen, 
quae super faciebus totius terrae, et omnem arborem, in qua fructus; arbor producens semen vobis erit in cibum. 	30.  Et omni ferae terrae, et omni avi caelorum, et omni reptanti super terra, in 
quo anima vivens, omne viride herbae in escam; et factum ita. 	31.  Et vidit DEUS omne quod fecit, et ecce bonum valde. Et fuit vespera, et fuit mane, dies sextus.
