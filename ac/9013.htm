<h3 align="center" class="ired">属天的奥秘 第9013节</h3>
<h4 align="center"></h4><p><strong>9013.</strong>“用诡计杀了他”表随之而来的剥夺邻舍永生的恶意。这从“杀”和“诡计”的含义清楚可知：“杀”是指从邻舍那里夺走信和仁，从而剥夺他的属灵生命，也就是永生（参看<a href="6767.htm">6767</a>，<a href="8902.htm">8902</a>节）；“诡计”是指出于意愿事先考虑或预谋，或出于故意的恶意。邪恶是要么出于敌意，要么出于仇恨，要么出于报复，要么是利用诡计，要么没用诡计而行出的。但用诡计所行的邪恶是最坏的，因为诡计就像用地狱毒液来感染并毁灭的一种毒药；事实上，它传遍整个心智，甚至直达它至内在的隐秘处。原因在于，充满诡计的人一心思想邪恶，并用它来喂养自己的理解力，使他的理解力以之为乐，从而毁灭其中属于人的一切，也就是构成属于信与仁之良善的生命的一切。<br />那些在世上利用诡计在世俗和尘世的事物上陷害邻舍的人，在来世就会利用诡计在属灵和属天的事物上陷害邻舍。他们因暗中如此行，故被逐入背后的地狱，照着诡计的恶毒和危害性而来到一个深处，以这种方式与那些在前面的人分开；前面的人被称为“灵人”，而后面的人则被称为“魔鬼”（<a href="5035.htm">5035</a>，<a href="5977.htm">5977</a>，<a href="8593.htm">8593</a>，<a href="8622.htm">8622</a>，<a href="8625.htm">8625</a>节）。魔鬼不允许像灵人那样靠近世人，因为他们通过违背爱与仁之良善而如此秘密地流入意愿的情感，以致它绝无可能被察觉出来；他们以这种方式摧毁信之真理。在他们自己的地狱，他们将自己置于其同伴的视线之外；因为那些在世上暗中行事的人在来世能把自己置于视线之外。当他们制造这种表象时，他们彼此看起来就像人；而当天使检查他们时，他们看似蛇。因为他们具有蛇的性质，凡从他们所出的东西就像毒药或毒气，事实上是属灵的毒药或毒气。<br />因此，在圣言中，“毒药或毒气”表示诡计，而“毒蛇”，如“角蝰或虺蛇”（asp）、“宽蛇或鸡蛇”（adders或cockatrices）、“蝰蛇或腹蛇或毒蛇”（viper），表示充满诡计的人；如以下经文：<br />你们是心中作恶。他们的毒气好像蛇的毒气，他们好像耳聋的虺蛇。<br />诗篇：<br />他们心中图谋恶事。他们使舌头尖利如蛇，嘴唇下有虺蛇的毒气。（诗篇<a href="http://39-27.cn/诗140.2.htm">140:2</a>，<a href="http://39-27.cn/诗140.3.htm">3</a>）<br />以赛亚书：<br />他们抱虺蛇蛋，结蜘蛛网。人吃它们的蛋必死。（以赛亚书<a href="http://39-27.cn/赛59.5.htm">59:5</a>）<br />约伯记：<br />他必吸饮虺蛇的毒气，蝮蛇的舌头也必杀他。（约伯记<a href="http://39-27.cn/伯20.16.htm">20:16</a>）<br />申命记：<br />他们的酒是龙的毒气，是虺蛇残忍的苦胆。（申命记<a href="http://39-27.cn/申32.33.htm">32:33</a>）<br />马太福音：<br />你们这假冒为善的文士和法利赛人有祸了！你们这些蛇类，毒蛇的子孙阿，怎能逃脱地狱的刑罚呢？（马太福音<a href="http://39-27.cn/太23.29.htm">23:29</a>，<a href="http://39-27.cn/太23.33.htm">33</a>）<br />当口头上虔诚，心里不虔诚时，或当口头上有仁爱，心里有仇恨时，或当纯真表现在脸和姿势上，残忍却在灵魂和胸中时，因而当人们利用纯真、仁爱和虔诚去骗人时，诡计就被称为假冒为善。“蛇”和“毒蛇”在内义上所指的，就是这些人，因为如前所述，当天使在天堂之光中检查这些人时，他们看似蛇和毒蛇。他们就是那些将邪恶隐藏在真理之下，也就是为了行恶而用诡计扭曲真理的人；因为这种人可以说把毒药藏在牙齿之下，并用它来杀人。<br />但那些被主引导相信真理，并过着一种良善生活的人不可能被他们的毒药伤害，因为他们生活在从主所接受的光中，在这光里，充满诡计的人看似蛇，他们的诡计则像毒药。主对门徒所说的话就表示主对他们的保护：<br />看哪，我已经给你们权柄可以践踏蛇和蝎子。（路加福音<a href="http://39-27.cn/路10.19.htm">10:19</a>）<br />马可福音：<br />信的人必有神迹随着他们；他们要拿蛇，若喝了什么致命之物，也必伤害他们。（马可福音<a href="http://39-27.cn/可16.17.htm">16:17</a>，<a href="http://39-27.cn/可16.18.htm">18</a>）<br />以赛亚书：<br />吃奶的必玩耍在毒蛇的洞口。（以赛亚书<a href="http://39-27.cn/赛11.8.htm">11:8</a>）<br />因属灵的诡计，也就是因伪善而内心已然败坏的人就是马太福音中那些说话干犯圣灵，不得赦免的人所指的人：<br />所以我告诉你们：人一切的罪和亵渎都可得赦免；惟独亵渎圣灵，总不得赦免。凡说话干犯人子的，他还可得赦免；惟独说话干犯圣灵的，今世、来世总不得赦免。你们或以为树好，果子也好；树坏，果子也坏。毒蛇的后代！你们既是恶人，怎能说出好话来呢？（马太福音<a href="http://39-27.cn/太12.31.htm">12:31</a>-<a href="http://39-27.cn/太12.34.htm">34</a>）.<br />“说话干犯圣灵”表示在属于主，祂的国度和教会，以及圣言的事上说得好，却思想邪恶，行得好，却意愿邪恶。因为这时，虚假就隐藏在他们所说的真理里面；而在他们所行良善里面的邪恶就是隐藏的毒药；这就是为何他们被称为“毒蛇的后代”。<br />在来世，恶人被允许说邪恶，以及虚假，但不允许说良善和真理，因为来世的所有人都被驱使从心里的说话，不允许有一个分裂的心智。那些不这样做的人便与其他人分离，藏在地狱里，他们永远无法从这地狱里出来。“说话干犯圣灵的”就表示这样的人，这一点从前面主所说的话清楚看出来，即：“你们或以为树好，果子也好；树坏，果子也坏，你们既是恶人，怎能说出好话来呢？”“圣灵”表示从主发出的神性真理，因而表示神圣的神性本身，它由此从内层被毁谤和亵渎。<br />这种亵渎之所以不得赦免，是因为涉及神性的神性事物的伪善或诡计败坏人的内层，摧毁他里面的属灵生命的一切，如前所述，最终毁得如此彻底，以致他里面到处都不健全。事实上，罪的赦免就在于把邪恶与良善分离，并将邪恶抛到两边（<a href="8393.htm">8393</a>节）。对一个其中一切良善都已被毁的人来说，这是不可能做到的。所以经上说他“今世、来世总不得赦免”。“没有穿礼服，被捆起手脚丢在外边黑暗里的人”（马太福音<a href="http://39-27.cn/太22.11.htm">22:11</a>-<a href="http://39-27.cn/太22.13.htm">13</a>，参看<w1>2132<w2>2132<w3>节）所指的人也具有这种秉性。<br />在圣言中，“诡计或诡诈”是指伪善，这一点从以下经文明显看出来：<br />你们各人当谨防同伴，不可信靠任何弟兄；因为弟兄都尽行欺骗。他们各人欺哄同伴，不说真话；他们教舌头说谎。你的住处在诡诈中间，他们因行诡诈不肯认识我。（耶利米书<a href="http://39-27.cn/耶9.4.htm">9:4</a>-<a href="http://39-27.cn/耶9.6.htm">6</a>）<br />诗篇：<br />说谎言的，你必灭绝；好流人血弄诡诈的，都为耶和华所憎恶。（诗篇<a href="http://39-27.cn/诗5.6.htm">5:6</a>）<br /><br />凡灵里没有诡诈、耶和华不算为有罪的，这人是有福的！（诗篇<a href="http://39-27.cn/诗32.2.htm">32:2</a>）<br /><br />求你救我的灵魂脱离说谎的嘴唇和诡诈的舌头。（诗篇<a href="http://39-27.cn/诗120.2.htm">120:2</a>）<br />类似例子出现在诗篇（<a href="http://39-27.cn/诗52.4.htm">52:4</a>；<a href="http://39-27.cn/诗109.2.htm">109:2</a>）。</p>

To kill him with deceit. That this signifies the consequent malice of depriving the neighbor of eternal life, is evident from the signification of "to kill," as being to take away faith and charity from 
the neighbor, and thus to deprive him of spiritual life, which is eternal life (see n. 6767, 8902); and from the signification of "deceit," as being malice from the will with forethought or premeditation, 
thus from set purpose. Evils are done either from enmity, or from hatred, or from revenge, and either with deceit or without it. But evils done with deceit are the worst, because deceit is like 
a poison which infects and destroys with infernal venom, for it goes through the whole mind even to its interiors. The reason is that he who is in deceit meditates evil, and feeds his understanding 
with it, and takes delight in it, and thus destroys everything therein that belongs to man, that is, which belongs to life from the good of faith and of charity. [2] They who in the world have ensnared 
the neighbor with deceit in respect to worldly and earthly things, in the other life ensnare the neighbor with deceit in respect to spiritual and heavenly things; and because they do this in secret, 
they are dispatched to the hells behind the back, deep down according to the malignity and hurtfulness of the deceit, and in this way are separated from those who are in front; the latter being called 
"spirits," but the former, "genii" (n. 5035, 5977, 8593, 8622, 8625). Genii are not admitted to men as spirits are, because they flow into the affections of the will, by acting against the good of 
love and charity so secretly that it cannot possibly be perceived; and in this way they destroy the truth of faith. In their own hell they render themselves invisible before their companions; for they 
who have acted secretly in the world can render themselves invisible in the other life; but when they appear, they appear among themselves like men; whereas when they are looked at by the angels they 
appear like serpents, for they have the nature of serpents, and that which goes forth from them is like poison, and indeed is spiritual poison. [3] Wherefore in the Word "poison" signifies deceit, 
and poisonous serpents, such as "asps," "cockatrices," and "vipers," signify the deceitful; as in the following passages: </p>
<p>     In heart ye work perversities, their poison is like the poison of a serpent; 
like that of the deaf asp (Ps. 58:2, 4).      They cogitate evils in the heart, they sharpen their tongue like a serpent; the poison of the asp is under their lips (Ps. 140:2, 3).      They lay 
eggs of the asp, and weave the spider's webs, he that eateth of their eggs dieth (Isa. 59:5).      He shall suck the poison of asps; the viper's tongue shall slay him (Job 20:16).      Their wine is 
the poison of dragons, and the cruel gall of asps (Deut. 32:33).      Woe unto you, scribes and Pharisees, hypocrites! Ye serpents, ye offspring of vipers, how shall ye escape the judgment of Gehenna 
(Matt. 22:29, 33). [4] Deceit is called "hypocrisy" when there is piety in the mouth, and impiety in the heart; or when there is charity in the mouth, but hatred in the heart; or when there is innocence 
in the face and gesture, but cruelty in the soul and breast; consequently when they deceive by a show of innocence, charity, and piety. Such are "serpents" and "vipers" in the internal sense, because, 
as before said, when such are looked at by the angels in the light of heaven, they appear like serpents and like vipers, who hide evils under truths; that is, who deceitfully bend truths to the 
doing of evils; for such hide poison as it were under the teeth, and thus kill. [5] But they who are in the faith of truth and in the life of good from the Lord, cannot be injured by the poisons of 
such, for they are in light from the Lord, in which the deceitful appear like serpents, and their deceits like poisons. That these are kept in safety by the Lord is meant by His words to the disciples: </p>
<p> 
    Behold I give unto you power to tread upon serpents and scorpions (Luke 10:19).      These signs shall follow them that believe; they shall take up serpents; and if they drink any deadly thing, 
it shall not harm them (Mark 16:17, 18).      The suckling shall play on the hole of the viper (Isa. 11:8). [6] Those who have been interiorly infected with spiritual deceit, that is, with hypocrisy, 
are they who are meant by those who speak against the Holy Spirit, for whom there is no forgiveness, in Matthew: </p>
<p>     I say unto you, All sin and blasphemy shall be forgiven unto men; but the blasphemy 
of the spirit shall not be forgiven unto men. Nay, if anyone shall say a word against the Son of man, it shall be forgiven him; but whosoever shall speak against the Holy Spirit, it shall not 
be forgiven him, neither in this age, nor in that which is to come. Either make the tree good, and its fruit good; or make the tree bad and its fruit bad. O offspring of vipers, how can ye, being evil, 
speak what is good (Matt. 12:31-34). By "saying a word against the Holy Spirit" is meant to speak well and think evil, and to do well and will evil, respecting those things which are of the Lord, 
of His kingdom, and of His church, also which are of the Word; for thus falsity lies inwardly hidden in the truths which they speak; and evil, which is hidden poison, in the goods which they do; consequently 
they are called "an offspring of vipers." [7] In the other life an evil person is allowed to speak evil and also falsity; but not good and truth, because there all are compelled to speak from 
the heart, and are not allowed to be of a divided mind. They who do otherwise are separated from the rest, and are hidden in hells from which they cannot possibly go forth. That such are they who are 
meant by "those who say a word against the Holy Spirit" is evident from the above words of the Lord, "Either make the tree good and its fruit good, or make the tree bad, and its fruit bad; how can ye, 
being evil, speak what is good?" The "Holy Spirit" denotes the Divine truth proceeding from the Lord, thus the Holy Divine Itself, which is thereby interiorly blasphemed and profaned. [8] That it will 
not be forgiven them is because hypocrisy or deceit in connection with Holy Divine things infects the interiors of man, and destroys everything of spiritual life in him, as was said above, insomuch 
that at last there is nothing sound in any part of him. For the forgiveness of sins is the separation of evil from good, and the rejection of evil to the sides (n. 8393), which cannot be done with him 
in whom all good has been destroyed. Therefore it is said "It shall not be forgiven him, neither in this age nor in that which is to come." Of this character also are those who are meant by "him that 
had not on a wedding garment," who was bound hand and foot and cast out into outer darkness (Matt. 22:11-13, see n. 2132). [9] That "deceit" in the Word denotes hypocrisy is evident from the following 
passages: </p>
<p>     Beware ye every man of his companion, and put ye not your trust upon any brother; for every brother supplanteth. They mock, a man with his companion, and speak not the truth; they 
have taught their tongue to speak a lie. Thy dwelling is in the midst of deceit; through deceit they have refused to know Me, said Jehovah (Jer. 9:4-6).      Thou shalt destroy them that speak a lie; 
Jehovah abhorreth the man of bloods and deceit (Ps. 5:6).      Blessed is the man unto whom Jehovah imputeth not iniquity, provided in his spirit there is no deceit (Ps. 32:2).      Deliver my soul 
from the lip of a lie, from a tongue of deceit (Ps. 120:2).      In like manner Ps. 52:4; 109:2. </p>

<p align="center"><b>Elliott(1983-1999) 9013</b></p><p><b>9013.</b>
'To kill him with guile' means consequent malice intent on depriving the neighbour of eternal life. This is clear from the meaning of 'killing' as taking faith and charity away from one's neighbour and 
so depriving him of spiritual life, which is eternal life, dealt with in <a href="6767.htm">6767</a>, <a href="8902.htm">8902</a>; and from the meaning of 'guile' as malice owing to prior thought or premeditation by the will, that is, owing to 
set purpose. Evil deeds are performed as a result either of enmity, or of hatred, or of vengeance; and they are performed with guile or without guile. But those performed with guile are the worst because 
guile is like a poison which is infectious and destroys with hellish consumption; for it spreads through the entire mind, right through to its inmost recesses. The reason why is that a person full 
of guile has his mind on evil. He feeds and delights his understanding with it, and in so doing he destroys everything which is human, that is, which composes life belonging to the good of faith and 
of charity. </p>
<p></p>
<p><b>[2]</b>
 Those who use guile while in the world to ensnare their neighbour in regard to worldly and earthly affairs use guile in the next life to ensnare their neighbour in regard to spiritual 
and celestial matters. And because they do it in a secret way they are banished to the hells behind the back, to a depth in keeping with the malevolence and harmfulness of their guile, and so are 
separated from those who are in front. These in front are called spirits, but those behind the back are called genii, <a href="5035.htm">5035</a>, <a href="5977.htm">5977</a>, <a href="8593.htm">8593</a>, <a href="8622.htm">8622</a>, <a href="8625.htm">8625</a>. Genii are not allowed near men as spirits are. For they 
enter affections belonging to the will, by acting in opposition to the good of love and charity, in so surreptitious a manner that it cannot possibly be detected; and in that way they destroy the 
truth of faith. In their own hells they place themselves out of sight to their companions; for those who have acted in concealment in the world can place themselves out of sight in the next life. When 
they make their appearance they look to one another like human beings; but when angels examine them they look like serpents. For they have the nature of serpents, and what goes out of them is like poison, 
indeed is spiritual poison. </p>
<p><b>[3]</b>
 For this reason 'poison' in the Word means guile, and 'poisonous serpents', such as asps, adders, or vipers, means people full of guile, as in David, </p>
<blockquote>
In heart 
you work perversities Their poison is like the poison of a serpent, like that of the deaf asp. <a href="http://bible.gospelcom.net/cgi-bin/bible?passage=Ps%2058:2,%204&amp;version=ESV&amp;interface=print&amp;showfn=yes&amp;showxref">Ps 58:2, 4</a>.

<p>In the same author, </p>
<blockquote>
They think evil things in their heart. They make their tongue sharp, 
like a serpent; the poison of an asp is under their lips. <a href="http://bible.gospelcom.net/cgi-bin/bible?passage=Ps%20140:2,%203&amp;version=ESV&amp;interface=print&amp;showfn=yes&amp;showxref">Ps 140:2, 3</a>.

<p>In Isaiah, </p>
<blockquote>
They lay eggs of the asp, and weave spider's webs; he who eats from their eggs dies, and when anyone presses 
it out a viper is hatched. <a href="http://bible.gospelcom.net/cgi-bin/bible?passage=Isa%2059:5&amp;version=ESV&amp;interface=print&amp;showfn=yes&amp;showxref">Isa 59:5</a>. 
</blockquote>
<p>In Job, </p>
<blockquote>
He will suck the poison of asps, the tongue of a viper will kill him. <a href="http://bible.gospelcom.net/cgi-bin/bible?passage=Job%2020:16&amp;version=ESV&amp;interface=print&amp;showfn=yes&amp;showxref">Job 20:16</a>.

<p>In Moses, </p>
<blockquote>

gall of asps. <a href="http://bible.gospelcom.net/cgi-bin/bible?passage=Deut%2032:33&amp;version=ESV&amp;interface=print&amp;showfn=yes&amp;showxref">Deut 32:33</a>. 
</blockquote>
<p>In Matthew, </p>
<blockquote>
Woe to you, scribes and Pharisees, hypocrites! How, O serpents, brood of vipers, will you escape the judgement of Gehenna? <a href="http://bible.gospelcom.net/cgi-bin/bible?passage=Matt%2023:29,%2033&amp;version=ESV&amp;interface=print&amp;showfn=yes&amp;showxref">Matt 23:29, 33</a>. 
</blockquote>
<p></p>
<p><b>[4]</b>
 Guile is 
called hypocrisy when people speak in godly ways but are ungodly at heart, or when they have charity on their lips but hatred in their heart, or when they express innocence on their face and in their 
gestures but have cruelty in their soul and breast; consequently they are those who use innocence, charity, or godliness to deceive. It is they who are meant in the internal sense by 'serpents' and 
'vipers', because when such people, as stated above, are examined in the light of heaven by angels they look like serpents and also vipers. They are those who conceal evils under truths, that is, who 
with guile twist truths in order to perform evil deeds; for they hide poison under their teeth, so to speak, and kill by means of it. </p>
<p></p>
<p><b>[5]</b>
 But those who are led by the Lord, believing what is true and 
leading a good life, cannot suffer injury from their poisons, since they live in light received from the Lord, and in that light those full of guile are seen as serpents and their guile as poison. 
Their preservation by the Lord is meant by the Lord's words to His disciples, </p>
<blockquote>
Behold, I give you the power to trample on serpents and scorpions. <a href="http://bible.gospelcom.net/cgi-bin/bible?passage=Luke%2010:19&amp;version=ESV&amp;interface=print&amp;showfn=yes&amp;showxref">Luke 10:19</a>. 
</blockquote>
<p>In Mark, </p>
<blockquote>
These signs will follow believers: 
They will take up serpents; and if they drink anything deadly it will not hurt them. <a href="http://bible.gospelcom.net/cgi-bin/bible?passage=Mark%2016:17,%2018&amp;version=ESV&amp;interface=print&amp;showfn=yes&amp;showxref">Mark 16:17, 18</a>. 
</blockquote>
<p>And in Isaiah, </p>
<blockquote>
A suckling will play over the viper's hole. <a href="http://bible.gospelcom.net/cgi-bin/bible?passage=Isa%2011:8&amp;version=ESV&amp;interface=print&amp;showfn=yes&amp;showxref">Isa 11:8</a>. 
</blockquote>
<p></p>
<p><b>[6]</b>
 People 
inwardly corrupted with spiritual guile, that is, with hypocrisy, are the ones who are meant by those speaking against the Holy Spirit, for whom there is no forgiveness, in Matthew, </p>
<blockquote>
I say to you, 
Every sin and blasphemy will be forgiven people, but the blasphemy of the Spirit will not be forgiven people. Indeed if anyone speaks a word against the Son of Man, it will be forgiven him; but he who 
speaks against the Holy Spirit, it will not be forgiven him, either in this age or in the one to come. Either make the tree good and its fruit good, or make the tree bad and its fruit bad. O brood of 
vipers, how can you speak good when you are evil? <a href="http://bible.gospelcom.net/cgi-bin/bible?passage=Matt%2012:31-34&amp;version=ESV&amp;interface=print&amp;showfn=yes&amp;showxref">Matt 12:31-34</a>. 
</blockquote>
<p>'Speaking a word against the Holy Spirit' means speaking well of things that belong to the Lord, to His kingdom and Church, and also 
to the Word, but thinking ill of them; and doing well in respect of them while desiring what is ill. For falsity then lies hidden within the truths they speak, and evil in the good deeds they perform, 
which is the hidden poison. This is why they are called 'a brood of vipers'. </p>
<p></p>
<p><b>[7]</b>
 In the next life an evil person is allowed to speak what is evil and also false, but not what is good and true, 
because all there are impelled to speak from the heart and not to have a divided mind. Those who do other than that are separated from the rest and hidden away in hells from which they can never come 
out. The fact that people such as these are meant by those speaking a word against the Holy Spirit is clear from the Lord's words there, 'Either make the tree good and its fruit good, or make the tree 
bad and its fruit bad. How can you speak good when you are evil?' The Holy Spirit is Divine Truth emanating from the Lord, thus that which is holy and Divine, which is thereby blasphemed and profaned 
on an inward level. </p>
<p></p>
<p><b>[8]</b>
 The reason why such blasphemy is not forgiven them is that hypocrisy or guile involving things that are holy and Divine corrupts a person inwardly and destroys everything of 
spiritual life with him, as stated above, at length so completely that there is no soundness anywhere in him. For the forgiveness of sins consists in evil being separated from good and cast away to 
the sides, <a href="8393.htm">8393</a>. But this cannot be done for someone with whom all good has been destroyed; and this is why it says, 'It will not be forgiven him, either in this age or in the one to come'. These are 
also the kind of people who are meant by the one who was not wearing a wedding garment, who was bound hand and foot and cast into outer darkness, <a href="http://bible.gospelcom.net/cgi-bin/bible?passage=Matt%2022:11-13&amp;version=ESV&amp;interface=print&amp;showfn=yes&amp;showxref">Matt 22:11-13</a>; see <a href="2132.htm">2132</a>. </p>
<p></p>
<p><b>[9]</b>
 The fact that 'guile' 
in the Word is hypocrisy is clear from the following places: In Jeremiah, </p>
<blockquote>
Take heed, a man of his companion, and put no trust in any brother, for every brother supplants wholly. They deceive, a man 
with his companion, and do not speak the truth; they have taught their tongue to speak a lie. Your habitation is in the midst of guile; on account of guile they have refused to know Me, said Jehovah.

`Ad occidendum illum dolo': quod significet inde malitiam (et aestum) ad deprivandum proximum vita aeterna, constat ex    significatione `occidere' quod sit fidem et charitatem proximo adimere et sic 
eum privare vita spirituali, quae est vita aeterna, de qua n. 6767, 8902, et ex significatione `doli' quod sit malitia ex voluntate {1}praevia cogitatione seu praemeditato, ita ex proposito.  Mala fiunt 
vel ex inimicitia, vel ex odio, vel ex vindicta, et illa vel per dolum vel absque dolo; sed mala per dolum sunt pessima quia dolus est sicut venenum quod tabe infernali inficit ac destruit, vadit 
enim per totam mentem, {2}usque ad interiora ejus; causa est quia qui in dolo est meditatur malum, et per id nutrit intellectum suum, et jucundat illum, (c)et sic destruit omne ibi quod est hominis, 
hoc est, quod est vitae ex bono fidei et charitatis. 	[2] Qui proximum dolo illaquearunt in mundo quoad mundana et terrestria, illi in altera vita dolo illaqueant {3}proximum quoad spiritualia et caelestia; 
et quia hoc faciunt in `occulto', relegantur in inferna post tergum, profunde secundum doli malignum (c)et nocivum; separantur sic ab illis qui a facie sunt; hi vocantur spiritus, {5}illi autem 
genii, n. 5035, 5977, 8593, 8622, 8625; genii, non admittuntur ad homines sicut {6}spiritus, quia illi influunt in affectiones quae sunt voluntatis, agendo contra bonum quod amoris et charitatis, tam 
clandestine ut nequaquam percipi possit, et per eam viam destruunt verum quod fidei; illi in infernis suis se invisibiles coram sociis reddunt; qui enim in abscondito egerunt in mundo, illi se invisibiles 
   in altera vita reddere possunt, at cum apparent, inter se apparent sicut homines; sed inspecti ab angelis apparent sicut serpentes, nam illis natura serpentum est, et quod exit ab illis, est 
sicut venenum, et quoque est venenum spirituale; [3] quapropter `venenum' in Verbo significat dolum, et `serpentes venenati,' sicut aspides, reguli, viperae, significant dolosos, ut apud Davidem, In 
corde perversitates operamini: venenum illorum sicut venenum serpentis, sicut aspidis surdae, Ps. lviii 3, 5 (A.V. 2, 4): </p>
<p>apud eundem, Cogitant mala in corde, exacuunt linguam suam sicut serpens;  
venenum aspidis sub labiis illorum, Ps. cxl 3, 4 (A.V. 2, 3): </p>
<p>apud Esaiam, Ova aspidis ponunt, et telas araneae texunt; qui comedit de ovis illorum moritur, et quando quis exprimit, excluditur vipera, 
lix 5: </p>
<p>apud Hiobum, Venenum aspidum suget, occidet eum lingua viperae, xx 16: </p>
<p>apud Moschen, Venenum draconum vinum illorum, et fel aspidum crudele, Deut. xxxii 33: </p>
<p>apud Matthaeum, Vae vobis, 
Scribae et Pharisaei, hypocritae! quomodo, o serpentes, progenies viperarum, effugietis judicium Gehennae?  xxiii 29, 33; </p>
<p>[4] dolus dicitur hypocrisis cum pietatem ore gerunt ac impietatem corde, vel 
cum charitatem ore at odium corde, vel cum innocentiam facie et gestu sed crudelitatem anima et pectore, proinde qui per innocentiam, charitatem, et pietatem fallunt; illi sunt `serpentes' et `viperae' 
in sensu interno, quia, ut supra dictum, tales in luce caeli {7}ab angelis inspecti apparent sicut serpentes, ac ut viperae, qui sub veris recondunt mala, hoc est, qui dolose vera inflectunt ad faciendum 
mala, nam illi quasi sub dentibus abscondunt venenum, et sic occidunt. 	[5] At qui a Domino in fide veri et vita boni sunt, a venenis illorum non possunt laedi, nam in luce sunt a (x)Domino in 
qua {8}dolosi apparent sicut serpentes, ac doli illorum ut venena; quod illi in tuto sint a Domino, intelligitur per Domini verba ad discipulos, Ecce do vobis potestatem calcandi super serpentes et 
scorpios, (Luc.) x 19: </p>
<p>apud Marcum, Signa credentes haec sequentur: serpentes tollent; etiamsi letale quid biberint, non illis nocebit, xvi (17,) 18: </p>
<p>et apud Esaiam, Ludet sugens super foramine viperae, 
xi 8. 	[6] Qui interius infecti sunt `dolo spirituali, hoc est, hypocrisi', illi sunt qui intelliguntur per loquentes contra Spiritum Sanctum, quibus {10}nulla remissio: apud Matthaeum, Dico 
vobis, Omne peccatum et blasphemia remittetur hominibus, (m)spiritus autem blasphemia non remittetur hominibus;(n) immo si quis dixerit verbum contra Filium hominis, remittetur illi; qui vero dixerit 
contra (x)Spiritum Sanctum, non remittetur illi, neque in hoc saeculo, neque in futuro.  Aut facite arborem bonam et fructum ejus bonum, aut facite arborem pravam et fructum ejus pravum; o progenies viperarum, 
quomodo potestis bonum loqui, cum mali sitis? xii 31-33 (,34); </p>
<p>(s)per `dicere verbum contra Spiritum Sanctum' est de illis quae Domini, {11}Ipsius regni et Ecclesiae sunt, tum quae Verbi, loqui 
bene at cogitare male, (c)ac facere bene (c)et velle male, nam sic latet intus in veris quae loquuntur falsum, et in bonis quae faciunt malum, quod est venenum absconditum; inde vocantur `progenies 
viperarum.' 	[7] In altera vita licet malo malum et quoque falsum loqui, non autem bonum et verum, quoniam omnes adiguntur ibi loqui ex corde, {12} ac non dividere mentem; qui aliter faciunt separantur 
a reliquis et reconduntur in infernis e quibus exire nusquam possunt; quod tales sint qui per dicentes verbum contra Spiritum Sanctum intelligantur, constat (c)a Domini verbis ibi, `Aut facite arborem 
bonam et fructum bonum, aut facite arborem pravam et fructum pravum: quomodo potestis bonum loqui cum mali sitis?' Spiritus Sanctus est Divinum Verum procedens a Domino, ita ipsum sanctum Divinum, 
quod sic interius blasphematur et profanatur.(s) 	[8] Quod `illis non remittetur' est quia hypocrisis seu dolus {13}circa sancta Divina inficit interiora hominis et destruit omne vitae spiritualis 
apud eum, ut supra dictum est, tandem usque adeo ut non alicubi integrum sit; remissio enim peccatorum est separatio mali a bono ac rejectio mali ad latera, n. 8393, quod non fieri potest apud quem 
omne bonum est destructum; ideo dicitur, `Non remittetur illi neque in hoc saeculo neque in futuro.' (m)Sunt quoque tales qui intelliguntur per `non indutum veste nuptiali, qui ligatus pedes et manus, 
et ejectus in tenebras exteriores,' Matth. xxii 11-13, {14}videatur n. 2132.(n) 	[9] Quod `dolus' in Verbo sit hypocrisis, constat ab his locis: apud Jeremiam, Vir a socio suo cavete, et super ullo 
fratre ne confidite; omnis namque frater supplantando supplantat, vir cum socio suo illudunt, et veritatem non loquuntur; docuerunt linguam suam loqui mendacium, habitare tuum in medio doli; ob dolum 
renuerunt cognoscere Me, dictum Jehovae, ix (3,) 4, 5 (A.V. 4-6): </p>
<p>apud Davidem, Perdes loquentes mendacium, virum sanguinum et doli abominatur Jehovah, (Ps.) v 7 (A.V. 6): </p>
<p>apud eundem, Beatus homo 
cui non imputat Jehovah iniquitatem, modo non in spiritu ejus dolus, Ps. xxxii 2: </p>
<p>et apud eundem, Libera animam meam a labio mendacii, a lingua doli, Ps. cxx 2; </p>
<p>pariter Ps. lii 4; Ps. cix 2. @1
