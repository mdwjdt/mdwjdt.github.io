<h3 align="center" class="ired">属天的奥秘 第7663节</h3>
<h4 align="center"></h4><p><strong>7663.</strong>“且把羊群牛群一同带去”表那些处于内层良善的人和那些处于外层良善的人。这从“羊群”和“牛群”的含义清楚可知：“羊群”是指内层良善；“牛群”是指外层良善（参看<a href="5913.htm">5913</a>，<a href="6048.htm">6048</a>节）。本节这些话，即“他们要和他们的孩子、他们的老人、儿子女儿，以及羊群牛群同去”在内义上表示属于教会的一切，即属于外在教会和内在教会的一切。“孩子、儿子和牛群”表示外在教会的事物；“老人、女儿和羊群”表示内在教会的事物；因为“老人”是指智慧；“女儿”是指对良善的情感；“羊群”是指良善本身或纯正的良善。这些是属于内在教会的东西；而“孩子”是指简单；“儿子”是指对真理的情感；“牛群”是指外在良善，这些是属于外在教会的东西。</p>

With our flock and with our herd will we go. That this signifies those who are in interior good and those who are in exterior good, is evident from the signification of "flock," as being interior good; 
and of "herd," as being exterior good (see n. 5913, 6048). By the words in this verse, that "they would go with their boys and their old men, and with their sons and with their daughters, and with 
their flock and with their herd," is meant in the internal sense everything that belongs to the church, both the external and the internal church. The things of the external church are meant by "boys, 
sons, and herd;" and the things of the internal church by "old men," "daughters," and "flock;" for "old men" denote wisdom; "daughters," the affections of good; and "flock," good itself, which are of 
the internal church; whereas "boys" denote simplicities; "sons," the affections of truth; and "herd," external good, which are of the external church. </p>

<p align="center"><b>Elliott(1983-1999) 7663</b></p><p><b>7663.</b>
'With our flocks and with our herds we shall go' means those governed by good, interior and exterior. This is clear from the meaning of 'flocks' as interior good, and of 'herds' as exterior good, dealt 
with in <a href="5913.htm">5913</a>, <a href="6048.htm">6048</a>. The words in this verse, saying that they would go with their children and old people, sons and daughters, and flocks and herds, are used to mean in the internal sense everything 
that belongs to the Church, both the external Church and the internal. What belongs to the external Church is meant by 'children', 'sons', and 'herds', and what belongs to the internal Church by 'old 
people', 'daughters', and 'flocks'; for 'old people' are aspects of wisdom, 'daughters' affections for good, and 'flocks' genuine good. These are what belong to the internal Church; but 'children' are 
aspects of simplicity, 'sons' affections for truth, and 'herds external good, these being what belongs to the external Church. </p>

</p><b>7663.</b>
`Cum grege nostro et cum armento nostro ibimus': quod significet qui in bono interiore et exteriore, constat ex significatione `gregis' quod sit bonum interius, et `armenti' quod sit bonum exterius, 
de qua n. 5913, 6048.  Per verba in hoc versu, quod `irent cum pueris et senibus, cum filiis et filiabus, ac cum grege et armento' intelligitur in sensu interno omne quod est Ecclesiae, tam externae 
quam internae; quae Ecclesiae externae sunt intelliguntur per `pueros, {1} filios, et {1} armentum,' et quae internae per `senes, filias, et gregem'; nam `senes' sunt sapientiae, `filiae' affectiones 
boni, et `grex' ipsum bonum; haec sunt Ecclesiae internae; at `pueri' sunt simplicitates, `filii' affectiones veri, et `armentum' bonum externum; haec sunt Ecclesiae externae. 	@1 i per$ </p>
