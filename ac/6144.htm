<h3 align="center" class="ired">属天的奥秘 第6144节</h3>
<h4 align="center"></h4><p><strong>6144.</strong>“因被饥荒所迫”表因为荒凉到了绝望的地步。这从“饥荒”的含义清楚可知，“饥荒”是指就教会的事物而言的荒凉（<a href="5415.htm">5415</a>，<a href="5576.htm">5576</a>节）；当经上说“因被饥荒所迫”时，它表示绝望（<a href="5279.htm">5279</a>节），因为荒凉的最后阶段就是绝望。绝望是荒凉和试探的最后阶段（参看<a href="5279.htm">5279</a>，<a href="5280.htm">5280</a>节），原因有很多，在此仅列举这些：绝望以一种有效和可感知的方式使那些感到绝望的人承认，没有一丝真理和良善来自他们自己，承认他们自己的东西使得他们受到诅咒；但他们被主从诅咒中解救出来；救恩通过真理与良善流入。绝望还能使他们感受到主所赐予的生活幸福；因为当人们从这种绝望的状态中走出来时，他们就像那些被判为死刑，但从监狱里被释放出来的人。此外，通过荒凉和试探，人们能获得对违反天堂生活的状态的洞察，并通过这些状态被赋予对天堂生活的幸福和快乐的感知和洞察。因为对幸福和快乐的感知和洞察若不通过与对立面相对照，是不可能的。因此，为了作出全面的对照，荒凉和试探会被延至极限，也就是绝望的地步。</p>

Because the famine grew strong upon them. That this signifies because there was desolation even to despair, is evident from the signification of "famine," as being desolation in respect to those things 
which are of the church (n. 5415, 5576); and when the famine is said "to grow strong," it denotes despair (n. 5279), for the last of desolation is despair. There are many reasons why despair is the 
last of desolation and of temptation (see n. 5279, 5280), of which only these following may be adduced. Despair causes those who feel it to acknowledge in an effectual and feeling manner that there is 
nothing of truth and good from themselves, and that from themselves they are condemned; but that they are delivered from condemnation by the Lord; and that salvation flows in by means of truth and good. 
Despair also causes them to feel the happiness of life which is from the Lord; for when they come out of that state, they are like those who have been condemned to death, and are set free from prison. 
Moreover by means of desolations and temptations, states contrary to heavenly life are felt, the result of which is the implantation of a sense and perception of the satisfaction and happiness of 
heavenly life; for a sense and perception of what is satisfying and happy is impossible without comparison with the opposites. To the end therefore that full comparisons may be made, desolations and 
temptations are brought to their utmost, that is, to despair. </p>

'Because the famine overwhelmed them' means because the desolation reached the point of despair. This is clear from the meaning of 'the famine' as desolation so far as things of the Church are concerned, 
dealt with in <a href="5415.htm">5415</a>, <a href="5576.htm">5576</a>. When it is said to 'overwhelm' them, it is despair, as in <a href="5279.htm">5279</a>, for the final stage of desolation is despair. Despair is the final stage of desolation and temptation, <a href="5279.htm">5279</a>, <a href="5280.htm">5280</a>, for a number of reasons, of which let only the following be advanced here: Through despair people are led in an effective and perceptible way to acknowledge that nothing true or good comes from 
themselves, and to acknowledge that what is their own has caused them to be damned but that with the Lord's aid they are delivered from damnation, with salvation entering in through what is true and 
good. Despair also exists to the end that life's bliss which the Lord imparts may be felt; for when people come out of that state of despair they are like those who have been condemned to death but 
then freed from prison. Periods of desolation and temptation also serve as the means by which people gain an insight into states contrary to heavenly life and from them are given a perception and insight 
into the bliss and happiness of heavenly life. For a perception and insight into bliss and happiness come in no other way than from a contrast with their opposites. Therefore so that they can have 
the one fully demonstrated as against the other, periods of desolation and temptation are protracted to the utmost, that is, to the point of despair. </p>

`{1}Quoniam' influit super illos fames':  quod significet quia desolatio usque ad desperationem, constat ex significatione `famis' quod sit desolatio (x)quoad illa quae sunt Ecclesiae, de qua n. 5415, 
5576; quae cum dicitur `invalescere', est desperatio, ut n. 5279, nam ultimum desolationis est desperatio.  Quod desperatio sit ultimum desolationis et tentationis, n. 5279,5280, est ob plures causas, 
quarum has solum afferre licet: per desperationem effective et sensibiliter agnoscitur quod nihil veri et boni ab ipsis, et quod ex se damnati sint sed quod a Domino liberentur a damnatione, et influat 
salus per verum et bonum; desperatio etiam est ob causam ut faustum vitae quod a Domino, sentiatur; nam cum ex statu illo veniunt, sunt sicut illi qui e carcere damnati mortis liberantur; etiam 
per desolationes et tentationes percipiuntur status contrarii vitae caelesti, inde sensus et perceptio fausti et felicis vitae caelestis inditur; aliunde  enim sensus et perceptio fausti et felicis quam 
ex relatione ad contraria, non venit; ut itaque plenae rationes habeantur, desolationes et tentationes ad summum, hoc est, ad desperationem perducuntur.   @1 I has quia here only$ </p>
