<h3 align="center" class="ired">属天的奥秘 第2826节</h3>
<h4 align="center"></h4><p><strong>2826.</strong>“现在我知道你是敬畏神的了”表来自神性之爱的荣耀。这从“知道”和“敬畏神”或对神的敬畏的含义清楚可知：当论及主的神性时，“知道”无非是指被联结，或也可说，得到荣耀，因为人性正藉着试探被联结到神性上（<a href="1737.htm">1737</a>，<a href="1813.htm">1813</a>节）；“敬畏神”或对神的敬畏在此是指神性之爱。由于这论及主在真理方面的神圣理性，故经上在此说“敬畏神”，而非敬畏“耶和华”。因为当论述真理时，经上会提及“神”；而当论述良善时，则会提及“耶和华”（<a href="2586.htm">2586</a>，<a href="2769.htm">2769</a>，<a href="2822.htm">2822</a>节）。主正是藉着神性之爱将人性本质联结到神性本质上，将神性本质联结到人性本质上，或也可说，荣耀祂自己（参看<a href="1812.htm">1812</a>，<a href="1813.htm">1813</a>，<a href="2253.htm">2253</a>节）。至于在圣言中，何谓“敬畏神”，这从根据内义所理解的许多经文可以看出来。在圣言中，对神的敬畏表示敬拜。事实上，这敬拜要么出于敬畏，要么出于信之善，要么出于爱之善。当论述未重生的人时，所指的是出于惧怕的敬拜；当论述重生的属灵之人时，所指的是出于信之善的敬拜；当论述重生的属天之人时，所指的是出于爱之善的敬拜。<br />I.“对神的敬畏”一般表示敬拜，这明显可见于列王纪：<br />以色列人去敬畏别神，随从列族的条规。迁入撒马利亚的各族起初不敬畏耶和华，所以耶和华叫狮子进入他们中间；于是有一个从撒马利亚掳去的祭司回来，住在伯特利，指教他们怎样敬畏耶和华。耶和华曾与以色列人立约，嘱咐他们说：不可敬畏别神，不可跪拜事奉他们，也不可向他们献祭。但你们当敬畏耶和华，向祂跪拜、献祭。（列王记下<a href="http://39-27.cn/王下17.7.htm">17:7</a>-<a href="http://39-27.cn/王下17.8.htm">8</a>，<a href="http://39-27.cn/王下17.24.htm">24</a>-<a href="http://39-27.cn/王下17.25.htm">25</a>，<a href="http://39-27.cn/王下17.28.htm">28</a>，<a href="http://39-27.cn/王下17.32.htm">32</a>-<a href="http://39-27.cn/王下17.33.htm">33</a>，<a href="http://39-27.cn/王下17.35.htm">35</a>-<a href="http://39-27.cn/王下17.37.htm">37</a>，<a href="http://39-27.cn/王下17.41.htm">41</a>）<br />此处“敬畏”明显表敬拜。以赛亚书：<br />因为这百姓以口亲近我，用嘴唇尊敬我，心却远离我；他们敬畏我，不过是领受人的吩咐。（以赛亚书<a href="http://39-27.cn/赛29.13.htm">29:13</a>）<br />此处他们“敬畏”一般表敬拜，因为经上说，这敬畏不过是人的吩咐。路加福音：<br />某城里有一个法官，不敬畏神，也不尊重人。（路加福音<a href="http://39-27.cn/路18.2.htm">18:2</a>）<br />“不敬畏神”表不敬拜祂。<br />II.当论述未重生的人时，对神的敬畏表出于惧怕的敬拜。这从以下经文明显看出来，摩西书：<br />当律法在西乃山上被颁布时，百姓对摩西说，对摩西说，求你和我们说话，我们必听，不要神和我们说话，恐怕我们死亡。摩西对百姓说，神降临是要试验你们，叫你们时常敬畏祂，不致犯罪。（出埃及记<a href="http://39-27.cn/出20.19.htm">20:19</a>-<a href="http://39-27.cn/出20.20.htm">20</a>）<br /><br />现在，这大火将要烧灭我们，我们何必冒死呢？若再听见耶和华我们　神的声音，就必死亡。求你近前去，听耶和华我们神所要说的一切话，将我们神对你说的话都传给我们，我们就听从遵行。你们对我说的话，耶和华都听见了。耶和华对摩西说，惟愿他们存这样的心敬畏我，常遵守我的一切诫命。（申命记<a href="http://39-27.cn/申5.25.htm">5:25</a>，<a href="http://39-27.cn/申5.27.htm">27</a>-<a href="http://39-27.cn/申5.29.htm">29</a>）<br />此处“叫你们时常敬畏祂，不致犯罪，存这样的心敬畏我，常遵守我的一切诫命”表出于惧怕的敬拜是针对他们而言的，因为这就是他们的秉性。事实上，凡其敬拜是外在的，根本不是内在的之人都通过惧怕被驱使尊重、服从法律。他们若不过良善的生活，知道何为内在并相信它，就不会进入任何内在敬拜，也就是神圣的敬畏。<br />倘若你不肯遵行写在这书上所写律法的一切话，不敬畏这荣耀而可畏惧的名，耶和华你的神，耶和华就必使你受奇灾，就是你种所受的灾，至大至长的灾，至重至久的病，也必使你所惧怕埃及各样疾病都临到你，贴在你身上。（申命记<a href="http://39-27.cn/申28.58.htm">28:58</a>-<a href="http://39-27.cn/申28.60.htm">60</a>）<br />此处“敬畏耶和华神这荣耀而可畏惧的名”也是指出于惧怕的敬拜；为使这种惧怕能存在于具有这种秉性的人当中，一切邪恶，甚至诅咒都被归给了耶和华（<a href="592.htm">592</a>，<a href="2335.htm">2335</a>，<a href="2395.htm">2395</a>，<a href="2447.htm">2447</a>节）。耶利米书：<br />你自己的恶必惩治你；你的背叛必责备你。由此可知可见，你离弃耶和华你的神，不存敬畏我的心，乃为恶事，为苦事。（耶利米书<a href="http://39-27.cn/耶2.19.htm">2:19</a>）<br />路加福音：<br />我对你们说：那杀身体以后不能再做什么的，不要怕他们。我要指示你们当怕的是谁，当怕那杀了以后又有权柄丢在地狱里的。我实在告诉你们：正要怕祂。（路加福音<a href="http://39-27.cn/路12.4.htm">12:4</a>-<a href="http://39-27.cn/路12.5.htm">5</a>；马太福音<a href="http://39-27.cn/太10.28.htm">10:28</a>）<br />此处“敬畏神”就暗含出于某种惧怕的敬拜，因为惧怕驱使他们服从，如前所述。<br />III.当论述重生的属灵之人时，“敬畏神”或“耶和华”表出于信之善的敬拜。这从以下经文明显看出来，摩西书：<br />王要将祭司利未人面前的这律法书，为自己抄录一份副本，那份副本要常在他身边，他要尽他一生的日子诵读，好学习敬畏耶和华他的神，谨守遵行这律法书上的一切话和这些律例。（申命记<a href="http://39-27.cn/申17.18.htm">17:18</a>-<a href="http://39-27.cn/申17.19.htm">19</a>）<br />就内义而言，“王”表信之真理；因为王权代表主的属灵国度（<a href="1672.htm">1672</a>，<a href="1728.htm">1728</a>，<a href="2015.htm">2015</a>，<a href="2069.htm">2069</a>节）。因此，“敬畏耶和华他的神”就是出于信之真理敬拜祂。由于信之真理与仁之良善不可分割，故经上以“谨守遵行这律法书上的话和律例”来描述。撒母耳记：<br />看哪！耶和华已经为你们立王了。你们若敬畏耶和华，事奉祂，听祂的声音，你们和治理你们的王，也都顺从耶和华你们的神就好了。（撒母耳记上<a href="http://39-27.cn/撒上12.13.htm">12:13</a>-<a href="http://39-27.cn/撒上12.14.htm">14</a>）<br />此处就内义而言，“敬畏耶和华”也和前面一样，表出于信之良善与真理的敬拜，因为所论述的是王或王权。<br />约书亚记：<br />现在你们要敬畏耶和华，诚心实意地事奉祂，将你们列祖所事奉的神除掉。（约书亚记<a href="http://39-27.cn/书24.14.htm">24:14</a>）<br />此处“敬畏耶和华”也表属灵之人所具有的出于良善与真理的敬拜，因为“诚心”论及信之良善（<a href="612.htm">612</a>节），“诚意”论及信之真理。耶利米书:<br />他们要作我的子民，我要作他们的神。我要使他们同心同道，好叫他们永远敬畏我，使他们和他们后世的子孙得福乐。又要与他们立永远的约，必施恩给他们，并不离开他们，且使他们有敬畏我的心，不离开我。（耶利米书<a href="http://39-27.cn/耶32.38.htm">32:38</a>-<a href="http://39-27.cn/耶32.40.htm">40</a>）<br />“敬畏神”在此是指出于信之良善与真理的敬拜，这从整个思路和经上用“子民”、“神”这些词的事实明显看出来：“子民”用来指那些具有信之真理的人（参看<a href="1259.htm">1259</a>，<a href="1260.htm">1260</a>节），当论述真理时，经上就用“神”这个名（<a href="2586.htm">2586</a>，<a href="2769.htm">2769</a>节，<a href="2807.htm">2807</a>节末尾）。以赛亚书：<br />刚强的民必荣耀你，强悍民族的城必敬畏你。（以赛亚书<a href="http://39-27.cn/赛25.3.htm">25:3</a>）<br />此处“敬畏神”也表出于属灵真理的敬拜，因为经上用了“民”和“城”这些词，“城”表教义的真理（参看<a href="402.htm">402</a>，<a href="2268.htm">2268</a>，<a href="2450.htm">2450</a>，<a href="2451.htm">2451</a>节）。<br />诗篇：<br />敬畏耶和华的是什么人呢？耶和华必指示他当选择的道路。（诗篇<a href="http://39-27.cn/诗25.12.htm">25:12</a>）<br />此处“敬畏耶和华的人”表敬拜祂的人。这论及属灵之人，这一点从以下事实明显看出来：经上说“耶和华必指示他的道路”，“道路”表真理（参看<a href="627.htm">627</a>，<a href="2333.htm">2333</a>节）。<br />凡敬畏耶和华、遵行祂道的人，便为有福。（诗篇<a href="http://39-27.cn/诗128.1.htm">128:1</a>）<br />此处的意思也一样。<br />敬畏耶和华的人要赞美祂！雅各的一切种都要荣耀祂！以色列的一切种都要敬畏祂！（诗篇<a href="http://39-27.cn/诗22.23.htm">22:23</a>）<br />此处“敬畏祂”表出于信之真理的敬拜，因为“以色列的种”是指教会的属灵一面，也就是信之良善与真理（<a href="1025.htm">1025</a>，<a href="1447.htm">1447</a>，<a href="1610.htm">1610</a>节）。摩西书：<br />以色列啊，现在耶和华你神向你所要的是什么呢？只要你敬畏耶和华你的神，遵行祂的道，爱祂，尽心尽性事奉耶和华你的神，遵守耶和华的诫命、律例。（申命记<a href="http://39-27.cn/申10.12.htm">10:12</a>-<a href="http://39-27.cn/申10.13.htm">13</a>）<br />此处描述了对于以色列所表示的属灵之人来说，什么叫“敬畏神”，即“遵行耶和华的道，爱祂，事奉祂，遵守祂的诫命、律例”。启示录：<br />我又看见一位天使飞在空中，有永远的福音，他大声说：应当敬畏神，将荣耀归给祂，因祂施行审判的时候已经到了！ （启示录<a href="http://39-27.cn/启14.6.htm">14:6</a>-<a href="http://39-27.cn/启14.7.htm">7</a>）<br />此处“敬畏神”表出于信之良善与真理的神圣敬拜。路加福音：<br />耶稣就对瘫子说，起来，拿你的褥子回家去吧！众人都惊奇，也荣耀神，并且满心惧怕。（路加福音<a href="http://39-27.cn/路5.24.htm">5:24</a>-<a href="http://39-27.cn/路5.26.htm">26</a>）<br />此处“惧怕”表诸如那些正藉着信之真理被引入爱之良善的人所具有的神圣敬畏。<br />IV.当论述重生的属天之人时，敬畏神或耶和华表出于爱之善的敬拜。玛拉基书：<br />我曾与利未立生命和平安的约，我将这两样赐给他，使他敬畏我，他就敬畏我，惧怕我的名。真实的律法在他口中，他嘴里没有不义的话。他以平安和正直与我同行。（玛拉基书<a href="http://39-27.cn/玛2.5.htm">2:5</a>-<a href="http://39-27.cn/玛2.6.htm">6</a>）<br />这论述的是主，就内义而言，祂就是“利未”。“利未”表祭司职位，也表爱。“敬畏”在此表神性之爱的良善，“真实的律法”表伴随它的真理，“平安和正直”表这二者。<br />以赛亚书：<br />从耶西的树墩子必生出一根枝条来，从他的根必发生一条嫩枝子；耶和华的灵必住在祂身上，就是智慧和明达之灵，谋略和能力之灵，知识和敬畏耶和华的灵，祂必以敬畏耶和华为乐。（以赛亚书<a href="http://39-27.cn/赛11.1.htm">11:1</a>-<a href="http://39-27.cn/赛11.3.htm">3</a>）<br />此处也是论述主。“知识和敬畏耶和华的灵”表真理的神性之爱，“祂必以敬畏耶和华为乐”表良善的神性之爱。<br />诗篇：<br />耶和华的训词正直，能快活人的心；耶和华的诫命清洁，能明亮人的眼目；耶和华的敬畏洁净，立定到永远；耶和华的审判真实，全然公义。（诗篇<a href="http://39-27.cn/诗19.8.htm">19:8</a>-<a href="http://39-27.cn/诗19.9.htm">9</a>）<br />此处“耶和华的敬畏洁净”表爱；“耶和华的审判真实”表信。“公义”论及爱之善，“审判”（或公平judgment）论及信之真理（参看<a href="2235.htm">2235</a>节），当真理变成良善，或信变成仁时，这些就被说成是“全然公义”。<br />诗篇：<br />看哪，耶和华的眼目看顾敬畏祂的人和仰望祂慈爱的人。（诗篇<a href="http://39-27.cn/诗33.18.htm">33:18</a>）<br /><br />耶和华不喜悦马的力大，不喜爱人的腿快。耶和华喜爱敬畏祂和盼望祂慈爱的人。（诗篇<a href="http://39-27.cn/诗147.10.htm">147:10</a>-<a href="http://39-27.cn/诗147.11.htm">11</a>）<br />“马的力大”表人自己思考真理的力量，因为“马”表理解力（参看<a href="2760.htm">2760</a>-<a href="2762.htm">2762</a>节）；“人的腿长”表人自己行善的力量；“敬畏耶和华的人”表那些出于对真理的热爱敬拜祂的人；“仰望祂慈爱的人”表那些出于对良善的热爱敬拜祂的人。在先知书中，当论及良善时，也会论及真理；当论及真理时，也会论及良善，因为圣言中的一切事物都有良善与真理的天上婚姻（参看<a href="683.htm">683</a>，<a href="793.htm">793</a>，<a href="801.htm">801</a>，<a href="2516.htm">2516</a>，<a href="2712.htm">2712</a>，<a href="2713.htm">2713</a>节）。<br />诗篇：<br />耶和华赐福给以色列的家，赐福给亚伦的家，凡敬畏耶和华的，无论大小，祂必赐福给他们。（诗篇<a href="http://39-27.cn/诗115.12.htm">115:12</a>-<a href="http://39-27.cn/诗115.13.htm">13</a>）<br />此处“凡敬畏耶和华的”表那些出于信之善和爱之善敬拜的人，“以色列的家”表示信之善，“亚伦的家”表爱之善。由于圣言中的一切事物都有天上的婚姻，如前所述，故这二者都被提及。<br />以赛亚书：<br />你经历的时光必有安稳可靠，有丰盛的救恩并智慧和知识，你以敬畏耶和华为至宝。（以赛亚书<a href="http://39-27.cn/赛33.6.htm">33:6</a>）<br />此处“智慧和知识”表与其真理结合的信之善；“敬畏耶和华”表爱之善。同一先知书：<br />你们中间谁是敬畏耶和华、听从祂仆人声音的？（以赛亚书<a href="http://39-27.cn/赛50.10.htm">50:10</a>）<br />“敬畏耶和华的”表出于爱敬拜的；“听从祂仆人声音的”表出于信敬拜的。若一个伴随另一个，这时天上的婚姻就存在了。<br />从所引用的上述圣言经文明显可知，对神的敬畏表敬拜，这敬拜要么出于惧怕，要么出于信之善，要么出于爱之善。不过，敬拜中惧怕的成分越多，信的成分就越少，爱的成分则更少；另一方面，敬拜中信的成分越，尤其爱的成分越多，惧怕的成分就越少。事实上，一切敬拜里面都有一种惧怕。不过，这种惧怕具有另一种形式和性质，其实是神圣的敬畏。神圣的敬畏与其说是对地狱和诅咒的惧怕，倒不如说是对作出或思想违背主和邻人，因而违背爱之善与信之真之事的惧怕。这是一种憎恶，这种憎恶一方面形成了爱之神圣与信之神圣的边界。由于如前所述，它不是对地狱和诅咒的惧怕，故那些居于信之善的人会有惧怕，而那些居于爱之善，也就是居于主里面的人则没大有。<br />V.因此，“敬畏”也表不信，或没有信和爱。如以赛亚书：<br />雅各啊，那创造你的，以色列啊，那形成你的，如此说，不要怕！因为我救赎了你，我曾提你的名召你，你是我的。（以赛亚书<a href="http://39-27.cn/赛43.1.htm">43:1</a>，<a href="http://39-27.cn/赛43.5.htm">5</a>；<a href="http://39-27.cn/赛44.8.htm">44:8</a>）<br />路加福音：<br />就是祂对我们祖宗亚伯拉罕所起的誓，祂恩赐我们，叫我们既从仇敌手中被救出来，就可以在祂面前，坦然无惧地用圣洁、公义事奉祂。（路加福音<a href="http://39-27.cn/路1.73.htm">1:73</a>-<a href="http://39-27.cn/路1.74.htm">74</a>）<br />同一福音书：<br />你们这小群，不要怕，因为你们的父乐意把国赐给你们。（路加福音<a href="http://39-27.cn/路12.32.htm">12:32</a>）<br />马可福音：<br />耶稣对管会堂的说，不要怕，只要信！（马可福音<a href="http://39-27.cn/可5.36.htm">5:36</a>；路加福音<a href="http://39-27.cn/路8.49.htm">8:49</a>-<a href="http://39-27.cn/路8.50.htm">50</a>）<br />同一福音书：<br />耶稣说，为什么这么胆怯，你们怎么没有信心呢？（马可福音<a href="http://39-27.cn/可4.40.htm">4:40</a>）<br />路加福音：<br />就是你们的头发，也都被数过了。所以，不要怕，你们比许多麻雀还贵重！（路加福音<a href="http://39-27.cn/路12.7.htm">12:7</a>）<br />在上述经文中，“怕”就是不信，或没有信和爱。</p>

<p align="center"><b>Potts(1905-1910) 2826</b></p><p><b>2826.</b>
For now I know that thou fearest God. That this signifies glorification from the Divine love, is evident from the signification of "knowing," when predicated of the Lord's Divine, as being nothing else 
than to be united, or what is the same, to be glorified; for it was being united to the Human Divine by means of temptations (n. 1737, 1813); and from the signification of "fearing God," or of the 
"fear of God," as being here the Divine love. And because this is predicated of the Lord's Divine rational as to truth, it is here said to fear "God," and not "Jehovah;" for when truth is treated of, 
it is said "God;" but when good, "Jehovah" (n. 2586,, 2769, 2822). That the Divine love is that by which the Lord united His Human Essence to His Divine Essence, and the Divine Essence to the Human, or 
what is the same, glorified Himself, may be seen above (n. 1812, 1813, 2253). What "fearing God" signifies in the Word, may be seen from a great many passages when understood as to the internal sense. 
The "fear of God" there signifies worship, and indeed worship either from fear, or from the good of faith, or from the good of love; worship from fear when the non-regenerate, worship from the good 
of faith when the spiritual regenerate, and worship from the good of love when the celestial regenerate are treated of.  [2] I. That the "fear of God" in general signifies worship, is manifest in the 
book of Kings: </p>
<p>     The sons of Israel feared other gods, and walked in the statutes of the nations. The nations sent into Samaria feared not Jehovah in the beginning, therefore Jehovah sent lions 
among them; and one of the priests whom they had carried away from Samaria came and dwelt in Bethel, and taught them how they should fear Jehovah. Jehovah made a covenant with the sons of Israel and commanded 
them, Ye shall not fear other gods, nor bow yourselves to them, nor serve them, nor sacrifice to them; but ye shall fear Jehovah, and bow yourselves down unto Him, and sacrifice to Him (2 Kings 
17:7-8, 24-25, 28, 32-33, 35-37, 41); </p>
<p>here "fearing" manifestly denotes worshiping. In Isaiah: </p>
<p>     Because this people have drawn nigh unto Me with their mouth, and have honored Me with their lips, 
and their heart hath removed itself far from Me, and their fear of Me is a commandment of men which hath been taught (Isa. 29:13); </p>
<p>where their "fear of Me" denotes worship in general; for it is said 
that the fear was a commandment of men. In Luke: </p>
<p>     There was in a city a judge who feared not God and regarded not man (Luke 18:2); </p>
<p>"fearing not God" means not worshiping Him.  [3] II. That 
the "fear of God" signifies worship from fear when the nonregenerate are treated of, is manifest from the following passages in Moses: </p>
<p>     When the Law was promulgated upon Mount Sinai, the people said 
unto Moses, Speak thou with us, and we will hear; but let not God speak with us, lest we die. And Moses said unto the people, God is come to prove you, and that His fear may be before you, that ye 
sin not (Exod. 20:19-20). And again: </p>
<p>     Now why shall we die? for this great fire will consume us; if we hear the voice of Jehovah our God anymore, then we shall die. Go thou near, and hear all that 
Jehovah our God shall say; and speak thou unto us all that Jehovah our God shall say unto thee; and we will hear it, and do it. And Jehovah said unto Moses, Who will give them to have such a heart 
as this, to fear Me, and keep all My commandments always (Deut. 5:25, 27-29); </p>
<p>here the "fear of God before you that ye sin not, and a heart to fear Me, and keep all My commandments," signifies worship 
from fear, in respect to them, because such was their quality; for they who are in external worship, and not in internal, are driven to the observance of the law and to obedience by fear; but still 
they do not come into internal worship or into holy fear [timor sanctus] unless they are in the good of life, and know what is internal, and believe it. In the same: </p>
<p>     If thou wilt not observe to 
do all the words of this law that are written in this book, to fear this glorious and fearful name, Jehovah thy God, Jehovah will make thy plagues wonderful, and the plagues of thy seed, plagues great 
and sure, and sore diseases and sure, and He will bring upon thee again all the sickness of Egypt, which thou wast afraid of, and they shall cleave unto thee (Deut. 28:58-60); </p>
<p>here also to "fear the 
glorious and fearful name of Jehovah God" is to worship from fear; and that this might exist among those of such a character, all evils even to cursings were attributed to Jehovah (n. 592, 2335, 2395, 
2447). In Jeremiah: </p>
<p>     Thine own wickedness shall correct thee, and thy backslidings shall reprove thee; know therefore and see that it is an evil thing and a bitter that thou hast forsaken Jehovah 
thy God, and that My fear is not in thee (Jer. 2:19). In Luke: </p>
<p>     I say unto you, Be not afraid of them that kill the body, but after that have no more that they can do; but I will warn you whom 
ye shall fear; fear Him who after He hath killed, hath power to cast into hell; yea, I say unto you, fear Him (Luke 12:4-5; Matt. 10:28); </p>
<p>here also "fearing God" involves worshiping from some fear, 
because fear drove them to obedience, as before said.  [4] III. That to "fear God" or "Jehovah" signifies worship from the good of faith, where the spiritual regenerate are treated of, is manifest 
from the following passages. In Moses: </p>
<p>     The king shall write for himself a copy of this law in a book before the priests the Levites, and it shall be with him, and he shall read therein all the days 
of his life, that he may learn to fear Jehovah his God, to keep all the words of this law, and these statutes, to do them (Deut. 17:18-19). In the internal sense "king" denotes the truth of faith; 
for royalty represented the Lord's spiritual kingdom (n. 1672, 1728, 2015, 2069). Hence to "fear Jehovah his God," is to worship Him from the truth of faith; and because this is inseparable from the 
good of charity, it is described by "keeping the words of the law and the statutes to do them." In Samuel: </p>
<p>     Behold Jehovah hath set a king over you. If ye will fear Jehovah and serve Him, and hearken 
unto His voice, then shall both ye and the king that reigneth over you be followers of Jehovah your God (1 Sam. 12:13-14); </p>
<p>here also in the internal sense "fearing Jehovah" denotes worshiping from 
the good and truth of faith, as before, because a king or royalty is treated of.  [5] In Joshua: </p>
<p>     Now fear Jehovah, and serve Him in integrity and in truth, and put away the gods which your 
fathers served (Josh. 24:14); </p>
<p>where also to "fear Jehovah" denotes worshiping from good and truth, which is of the spiritual man; for "integrity" is predicated of the good of faith (n. 612), and "truth" 
of the truth of faith. In Jeremiah: </p>
<p>     They shall be My people, and I will be their God; and I will give them one heart, and one way, that they may fear Me forever, for the good of them and of 
their children after them; and I will make an everlasting covenant with them, that I will not turn away from them, to do them good; and I will put My fear in their heart, that they shall not depart from 
Me (Jer. 32:38-40); </p>
<p>that "fearing God" here is worshiping from the good and truth of faith, is evident from the series, and from the use of the words "people" and "God." (That those are called "people" 
who are in truth, may be seen above, n. 1259, 1260; and that "God" is named where truth is treated of, n. 2586, 2769, 2807 at the end.) In Isaiah: </p>
<p>     The strong people shall honor Thee, the city 
of the mighty nations shall fear Thee (Isa. 25:3); </p>
<p>where "fearing God" also denotes worshiping from spiritual truth, for it is predicated of "people" and "city." (That a "city" is doctrinal truth 
may be seen above, n. 402, 2268, 2450, 2451.)  [6] In David: </p>
<p>     What man is he that feareth Jehovah? Him shall He teach the way that He shall choose (Ps. 25:12); </p>
<p>where the "man that feareth Jehovah" 
denotes him who worships Him; and that this is said of the spiritual man is manifest from its being said, "him shall He teach the way." (That a "way" is truth, may be seen above, n. 627, 2333.) And 
again with similar meaning: </p>
<p>     Blessed is every one that feareth Jehovah, that walketh in His ways (Ps. 128:1). In the same: </p>
<p>     They that fear Jehovah shall glorify Him; all the seed of Jacob 
shall glorify Him, and all the seed of Israel shall stand in awe of Him (Ps. 22:23); </p>
<p>here to "stand in awe of him" means to worship from the truth of faith; for the "seed of Israel" is the spiritual 
of the church, or the good and truth of faith (n. 1025, 1447, 1610). In Moses: </p>
<p>     Now Israel, what doth Jehovah thy God require of thee, but to fear Jehovah thy God, to walk in all His ways, and 
to love Him, and to serve Jehovah thy God, with all thy heart, and with all thy soul, to keep the commandments of Jehovah, and His statutes (Deut. 10:12-13). Here is described what it is to "fear God," 
with the spiritual man, that is, "Israel;" namely, that it is to walk in the ways of Jehovah, to love Him, to serve Him, and to keep His precepts and His statutes. In John: </p>
<p>     I saw an angel flying 
in the midst of heaven, having the everlasting Gospel, saying with a great voice, Fear God, and give glory to Him, for the hour of His judgment is come (Rev. 14:6-7); </p>
<p>here to "fear God" denotes holy 
worship from the good and truth of faith. In Luke: </p>
<p>     Jesus said to him that was palsied, Arise, take up thy couch, and go unto thy house; and amazement took hold upon them all; and they glorified 
God, and they were filled with fear (Luke 5:24-26); </p>
<p>where "fear" denotes holy fear, such as is that of those who are being initiated into the good of love by the truth of faith.  [7] IV. That to 
"fear God" or "Jehovah" signifies worship from the good of love, when the celestial regenerate are treated of. In Malachi: </p>
<p>     My covenant was with Levi, of lives and peace; and I gave them to him 
that he might fear, and he feared Me, and for My name was he broken. The law of truth was in his mouth, and unrighteousness was not in his lips; he walked with Me in peace and uprightness (Mal. 2:5-6); </p>
<p>where 
the Lord is treated of, who here in the internal sense is "Levi;" "Levi" signifies the priesthood, and signifies love; "fear" here denotes the good of Divine love; the "law of truth," truth; 
and "peace and uprightness," both.  [8] In Isaiah: </p>
<p>     There shall come forth a shoot out of the stock of Jesse, and a branch shall grow out of his roots; and the spirit of Jehovah shall rest upon 
Him, the spirit of wisdom and understanding, the spirit of counsel and might, the spirit of knowledge and of the fear of Jehovah, and of His scent in the fear of Jehovah (Isa. 11:1-3); </p>
<p>where also the 
Lord is treated of. The "spirit of knowledge and of the fear of Jehovah" denotes the Divine love of truth; and His "scent in the fear of Jehovah," the Divine love of good.  [9] In David: </p>
<p>     The precepts 
of Jehovah are right, rejoicing the heart; the commandment of Jehovah is pure, enlightening the eyes; the fear of Jehovah is clean, standing forever; the judgments of Jehovah are truth, made righteous 
together (Ps. 19:8-9); </p>
<p>where "the fear of Jehovah is clean" denotes love; and "the judgments of Jehovah are truth" denotes faith. (That "righteousness" is predicated of the good of love, and 
"judgment" of the truth of faith, may be seen above, n. 2235) and these are said to be "made righteous together," when truth becomes good, or when faith becomes charity.  [10] In the same: </p>
<p>     Behold 
the eye of Jehovah is upon them that fear Him, upon them that wait for His mercy (Ps. 33:18). And again: </p>
<p>     Jehovah delighteth not in the strength of the horse, He taketh not pleasure in the legs 
of a man. Jehovah taketh pleasure in them that fear Him, in those that wait for His mercy (Ps. 147:10-11); </p>
<p>the "strength of the horse" denotes one's own power of thinking truth (that a "horse" denotes 
the intellectual faculty, may be seen above, 2760-2762); the "legs of a man" denote one's own power of doing good; "they that fear Jehovah" denote those who worship Him from the love of truth; and 
"they that wait for His mercy," those who worship from the love of good. Where good is spoken of in the Prophets, so also is truth; and where truth is spoken of, so also is good, on account of the 
heavenly marriage of good and truth in everything (see n. 683, 793, 801, 2516, 2712, 2713).  [11] In the same: </p>
<p>     Jehovah will bless the house of Israel, He will bless the house of Aaron, He will 
bless them that fear Jehovah, both small and great (Ps. 115:12-13); </p>
<p>here "they that fear Jehovah" denote those who worship from the good of faith, which is the "house of Israel," and from the good of 
love, which is the "house of Aaron;" they are both named on account of the heavenly marriage, as said above, in everything in the Word.  [12] In Isaiah: </p>
<p>     The truth of thy times shall be strength 
of salvations, wisdom, and knowledge; the fear of Jehovah itself a treasure (Isa. 33:6); </p>
<p>where "wisdom and knowledge" denote the good of faith conjoined with its truth; and the "fear of Jehovah," the 
good of love. In the same: </p>
<p>     Who is among you that feareth Jehovah, hearkening to the voice of His servant (Isa. 50:10)? "he that feareth Jehovah" denotes him that worships from love; "he that 
hearkeneth to the voice of His servant," him that worships from faith. When the one is of the other, then there is the heavenly marriage.  [13] From the passages which have been adduced from the Word 
it is evident that the "fear of God" is worship, either from fear, or from the good of faith, or from the good of love. But the more there is of fear in the worship, the less there is of faith, and 
the less still of love; and on the other hand, the more of faith there is in the worship, and especially the more there is of love, the less there is of fear. There is indeed a fear within all worship, 
but under another appearance and another condition, and this is holy fear. But holy fear is not so much the fear of hell and of damnation, as it is of doing or thinking anything against the Lord and 
against the neighbor, and thus anything against the good of love and the truth of faith. It is an aversion, which is the boundary of the holy of love and the holy of faith on the one side; and as it 
is not a fear of hell and damnation, as before said, those have it who are in the good of faith; but those have less of it who are in the good of love, that is, who are in the Lord.  [14] V. Therefore 
to "fear" signifies also to distrust, or not to have faith and love, as in Isaiah: </p>
<p>     Thus saith thy Creator, O Jacob, and thy Former, O Israel, Fear not, for I have redeemed thee I have called thee 
by thy name, thou art Mine (Isa. 43:1, 5; 44:8). In Luke: </p>
<p>     The oath which He sware to our father Abraham, that He would grant unto us, that we being delivered out of the hand of our enemies, 
might serve Him without fear, in holiness and righteousness before Him (Luke 1:73-74). In the same: </p>
<p>     Fear not, little flock, for it is your Father's good pleasure to give you the kingdom (Luke 
12:32). In Mark: </p>
<p>     Jesus said unto the ruler of the synagogue, Fear not, only believe (Mark 5:36; Luke 8:49-50). In the same: </p>
<p>     Jesus said, Why are ye so fearful? How is it that ye have no faith? 
(Mark 4:40). In Luke: </p>
<p>     The hairs of your head are all numbered; fear not therefore, ye are of more value than many sparrows (Luke 12:7). In these passages to "fear" is to distrust, or not 
to have faith and love. </p>

'For now I know that you fear God' means glorification from Divine love. 'This is clear from the meaning of 'knowing', in reference to the Lord's Divine, as nothing other than being united, or what amounts 
to the same, being glorified, for the Human was being united to the Divine by means of temptations, <a href="1737.htm">1737</a>, <a href="1813.htm">1813</a>; and from the meaning of 'fearing God', or the fear of God, as in this case Divine 
love. As this has reference to the Lord's Divine Rational as regards truth, the expression 'fearing God' is used here, not 'fearing Jehovah', for when truth is the subject the name God occurs, but when 
good is, the name Jehovah occurs, <a href="2586.htm">2586</a>, <a href="2769.htm">2769</a>, <a href="2822.htm">2822</a>. For it was by means of Divine love that the Lord united the Human Essence to the Divine Essence, and the Divine Essence to the Human Essence, or 
what amounts to the same, glorified Himself, see <a href="1812.htm">1812</a>, <a href="1813.htm">1813</a>, <a href="2253.htm">2253</a>. What is meant in the Word by 'fearing God' becomes clear from very many places there when these are understood as to the internal sense. 
In the Word the fear of God means worship, and indeed worship based either on fear, or on good that flows from faith, or on good that flows from love. Worship based on fear is meant when those who 
are not regenerate are the subject, worship based on good flowing from faith when regenerate spiritual people are the subject, and worship based on good flowing from love when regenerate celestial people 
are the subject. </p>
<p></p>
<p><b>[2]</b>
 I The fear of God in general means worship. This is evident in the Book of Kings, </p>
<p>The children of Israel feared other gods and walked in the statutes of the nations. The 
nations brought into Samaria did not at the beginning fear Jehovah; therefore Jehovah sent lions among them. Then came one of the priests whom they had made captives in Samaria, and he dwelt in Bethel 
and was teaching them how to fear Jehovah. Jehovah had made a covenant with the children of Israel and had commanded them, You shall not fear other gods, nor bow yourselves down to them, and you shall 
not serve them, nor sacrifice to them, but you shall fear Jehovah, and bow yourselves down to Him, and sacrifice to Him. <a href="2.htm">2</a> Kings 17: <a href="7.htm">7</a>, <a href="8.htm">8</a>, <a href="24.htm">24</a>, <a href="25.htm">25</a>, <a href="28.htm">28</a>, <a href="32.htm">32</a>, <a href="33.htm">33</a>, <a href="35.htm">35</a>-<a href="37.htm">37</a>, <a href="41.htm">41</a>.  </p>
<p>Here 'fearing' clearly 
stands for worshipping. In Isaiah, </p>
<p>Because this people have drawn near with their mouth, and honoured Me with their lips, but their heart has been far from Me, and their fear of Me has been a commandment 
of men that has been taught to them.... Isa. 29: <a href="13.htm">13</a>. </p>
<p>Here 'their fear of Me' stands for worship in general, for it is said that that fear was 'a commandment of men'. In Luke, </p>
<p>There was in 
a certain city a judge who did not fear God and did not regard man. Luke 18: <a href="2.htm">2</a>. </p>
<p>'Who did not fear God' stands for not worshipping Him. </p>
<p></p>
<p><b>[3]</b>
 II The fear of God means worship based on fear when those 
who are not regenerate are the subject </p>
<p>This is evident from the following places: In Moses, when the Law was delivered on Mount Sinai to the people, </p>
<p>The people said to Moses, You yourself speak 
to us and we will listen; and do not let God speak to us lest perhaps we die. And Moses said to the people, For God has come to tempt you, and to the end that His fear may be before your faces, so 
that you do not sin. Exod. 20: <a href="19.htm">19</a>, <a href="20.htm">20</a>. </p>
<p>And elsewhere in the same author, </p>
<p>Now why should we die? For this great fire will devour us; if we hear the voice of Jehovah our God any more we shall die. 
You go near and hear all that Jehovah our God will say, and then you tell us all that Jehovah our God will say to you, and we will listen and act. And Jehovah said to Moses, Who will grant it that 
they have this heart within them to fear Me and to keep all My commandments all their days? Deut. 5: <a href="25.htm">25</a>, <a href="27.htm">27</a>, <a href="29.htm">29</a>. </p>
<p>Here 'the fear of God before your faces, so that you do not sin' and 'a heart to fear 
Me and to keep all My commandments' means worship based on fear attributable to them because they are by nature what they are. Indeed people whose worship is external, and not at all internal, are led 
through fear to respect the law and to obey it; but they do not enter into any internal worship, which is holy fear, unless the good of life is present in them, and they know what is internal, and 
believe it. In the same author, </p>
<p>If you do not take care to do all the words of this Law that are written in this Book, to fear this glorious and fearful name, Jehovah your God, Jehovah will make your 
plagues exceptional,<A name="fntext1"></a><A href="#fn1"><sup>a</sup></a> and the plagues of your seed, plagues great and persistent, and diseases bad and persistent. And He will bring back on you all the sicknesses of Egypt which you fear, and they 
will cling to you. Deut. 28: <a href="58.htm">58</a>-<a href="60.htm">60</a>. </p>
<p>Here also 'fearing the glorious and terrible name of Jehovah God' means worship based on fear; and in order that this fear might exist among such persons all evils, 
even cursings, were attributed to Jehovah, <a href="592.htm">592</a>, <a href="2335.htm">2335</a>, <a href="2395.htm">2395</a>, <a href="2447.htm">2447</a>. In Jeremiah, </p>
<p>Your wickedness will chasten you, and your backslidings will reprove you. Know and see that it is evil and bitter 
for you to forsake Jehovah your God, and for My fear not to be in you. Jer. 2: <a href="19.htm">19</a>. </p>
<p>In Luke, </p>
<p>I tell you, Do not fear those who kill the body, but after that have no more that they can do. But I 
will show you whom you ought to fear; fear Him who, after He has killed, has power to cast into Gehenna; yes, I tell you, fear Him. Luke 12: <a href="4.htm">4</a>, <a href="5.htm">5</a>; Matt. 10: <a href="28.htm">28</a>. </p>
<p>Here also 'fearing God' implies worship 
based on some kind of fear, for fear drove those people to obey, as has been stated. </p>
<p></p>
<p><b>[4]</b>
 III Fearing God or Jehovah means worship based on good that flows from faith, when regenerate spiritual 
people are the subject. </p>
<p>This is evident from the following places: In Moses, </p>
<p>The king will write for himself a copy of this Law in a Book before the Levite priests. And it will be with him, and 
he will read from it every day of his life, so that he may learn to fear Jehovah his God, keeping all the words of this Law and these statutes to do them. Deut. 17: <a href="18.htm">18</a>, <a href="19.htm">19</a>. </p>
<p>'The king' in the internal 
sense stands for the truth of faith since the office of a king represented the Lord's spiritual kingdom, <a href="1672.htm">1672</a>, <a href="1728.htm">1728</a>, <a href="2015.htm">2015</a>, <a href="2069.htm">2069</a>. Consequently 'fearing Jehovah his God' means worship of Him based on 
the truth of faith, which, being inseparable from the good of charity, is described as 'keeping the words of the Law and these statutes to do them'. In Samuel, </p>
<p>Behold, Jehovah has set a king over 
you. If you will fear Jehovah and serve Him, and hearken to His voice, both you, and the king who reigns over you, will be following Jehovah your God. <a href="1.htm">1</a> Sam. 12: <a href="13.htm">13</a>, <a href="14.htm">14</a>. </p>
<p>Here too 'fearing Jehovah' 
stands in the internal sense for worship based on the good and truth of faith, as previously, since a king or the kingly office is the subject. </p>
<p></p>
<p><b>[5]</b>
 In Joshua, </p>
<p>Now fear Jehovah, and serve Him in 
sincerity and truth, and put away the gods which your fathers served. Josh. 24: <a href="14.htm">14</a>. </p>
<p>Here also 'fearing Jehovah' stands for worship based on good and truth which exist with the spiritual man, for 'sincerity' 
is used in reference to the good of faith, <a href="612.htm">612</a>, 'truth' to the truth of faith. In Jeremiah, </p>
<p>They will be My people and I will be their God; and I will give them one heart and one way, to 
fear Me all their days, for their own good and that of their sons after them. And I will make with them an everlasting covenant, that I will not turn back from doing good to them, and I will put My fear 
into their heart of not departing from Me. Jer. 32: <a href="38.htm">38</a>-<a href="40.htm">40</a>. </p>
<p>Here 'fearing God' means worship based on the good and truth of faith. This becomes clear from the train of thought and from the fact that 
the words 'people' and 'God' are used - 'people' being used in reference to those with whom the truth of faith exists, see <a href="1259.htm">1259</a>, <a href="1260.htm">1260</a>, and 'God' being used when truth is the subject, <a href="2586.htm">2586</a>, <a href="2769.htm">2769</a>, <a href="2807.htm">2807</a> 
(end). In Isaiah, </p>
<p>A powerful people will honour You, the city of strong nations will fear You. Isa. 25: <a href="3.htm">3</a>. </p>
<p>Here also 'fearing God' stands for worship based on spiritual truth, since the expressions 
'people' and 'city' are used - 'the city' meaning doctrinal teaching that is true, see <a href="402.htm">402</a>, <a href="2268.htm">2268</a>, <a href="2449.htm">2449</a>, <a href="2451.htm">2451</a>. </p>
<p></p>
<p><b>[6]</b>
 In David, </p>
<p>Who is the man that fears Jehovah? He will teach him the way that 
he should choose. Ps. 25: <a href="12.htm">12</a>. </p>
<p>Here 'the man that fears Jehovah' stands for one who worships Him. This refers to the spiritual man, as is evident from the fact that it is said 'He will teach him 
the way' - 'way' meaning truth, see <a href="627.htm">627</a>, <a href="2333.htm">2333</a>. In the same author, </p>
<p>Blessed is everyone who fears Jehovah and walks in His ways! Ps. 128: <a href="1.htm">1</a>. </p>
<p>Here the meaning is similar. In the same author, </p>
<p>Those 
who fear Jehovah will glorify Him, all the seed of Jacob will glorify Him; and they will stand in awe of Him, all the seed of Israel. Ps. 22: <a href="23.htm">23</a>. </p>
<p>Here 'standing in awe of Him' stands for worship 
based on the truth of faith, for 'the seed of Israel' is the spiritual side of the Church, that is, the good and truth of faith, <a href="1025.htm">1025</a>, <a href="1447.htm">1447</a>, <a href="1610.htm">1610</a>. In Moses, </p>
<p>Now Israel, what does Jehovah your God 
require of you but to fear Jehovah your God, to walk in all His ways, and to love Him, and to serve Jehovah your God with all your heart, and with all your soul, to keep Jehovah's commandments and His 
statutes? Deut. 10: <a href="12.htm">12</a>, <a href="13.htm">13</a>. </p>
<p>Here a description occurs of what 'fearing God' entails in the case of the spiritual man, meant by 'Israel', namely 'walking in the ways of Jehovah, loving Him, serving 
Him, and keeping His commandments and statutes'. In John, </p>
<p>I saw an angel flying in mid-heaven, having an eternal gospel, and saying in a loud voice, Fear God and give glory to Him, for the hour 
of His judgement has come. Rev. 14: <a href="6.htm">6</a>, <a href="7.htm">7</a>. </p>
<p>Here 'fearing God' stands for holy worship based on the good and truth of faith. In Luke, </p>
<p>Jesus said to the paralysed man, Rise, take up your bed and go 
away to your home. As a consequence amazement seized them all, and they glorified God, and were filled with fear. Luke 5: <a href="24.htm">24</a>-<a href="26.htm">26</a>. </p>
<p>Here 'fear' stands for holy fear as it exists in people who by means 
of the truth of faith are being introduced into the good of love. </p>
<p></p>
<p><b>[7]</b>
 IV Fearing God or Jehovah means worship based on good that flows from love, when regenerate celestial people are the subject. </p>
<p>In 
Malachi, </p>
<p>My covenant with Levi was [a covenant] of life and peace, and I gave them to him with fear; and he feared Me, and for My name he was crushed. The law of truth was in his mouth, and 
perversity was not [found] on his lips. He walked with Me in peace and uprightness. Mal. 2: <a href="5.htm">5</a>, <a href="6.htm">6</a>. </p>
<p>This refers to the Lord, meant here by 'Levi' in the internal sense. 'Levi' means the priesthood, and 
he means love. 'Fear' in this instance stands for the good that flows from Divine Love, 'the law of truth' for the truth that accompanies it, 'peace and uprightness' for both. </p>
<p></p>
<p><b>[8]</b>
 In Isaiah, </p>
<p>There 
will come forth a shoot from the stump of Jesse, and a branch will grow out of his roots. And the Spirit of Jehovah will rest upon Him, the Spirit of wisdom and intelligence, the Spirit of counsel 
and might, the Spirit of knowledge and the fear of Jehovah. And His delight<A name="fntext2"></a><A href="#fn2"><sup>b</sup></a> will be in the fear of Jehovah. Isa. 11: <a href="1.htm">1</a>-<a href="3.htm">3</a>. </p>
<p>This too refers to the Lord. 'The Spirit of knowledge and the fear of 
Jehovah' stands for the Divine love of truth, 'His delight will be in the fear of Jehovah' for the Divine love of good. </p>
<p></p>
<p><b>[9]</b>
 In David, </p>
<p>The commandments of Jehovah are right, rejoicing the heart; 
the commandment of Jehovah is pure, enlightening the eyes; the fear of Jehovah is clean, standing for ever; the judgements of Jehovah are truth, righteous altogether. Ps. 19: <a href="8.htm">8</a>, <a href="9.htm">9</a>. </p>
<p>Here 'the fear of 
Jehovah is clean' stands for love, 'the judgements of Jehovah are truth' for faith. 'Righteousness' is used in reference to good that is the good of love, 'judgements' to truth that is the truth of 
faith, see <a href="2235.htm">2235</a>; and these are called 'righteous altogether' when truth consists in good, or faith in charity. </p>
<p></p>
<p><b>[10]</b>
 In the same author, </p>
<p>Behold, the eye of Jehovah is on those who fear Him, on those 
who await His mercy. Ps. 33: <a href="18.htm">18</a>. </p>
<p>And elsewhere in the same author, </p>
<p>Jehovah takes no delight in the might of the horse, nor pleasure in the legs of man Jehovah's pleasure is in those who fear 
Him and in those who await His mercy. Ps. 147: <a href="10.htm">10</a>, <a href="11.htm">11</a>. </p>
<p>'The might of the horse' stands for a person's own power to think what is true; for 'a horses means the understanding, see <a href="2760.htm">2760</a>-<a href="2762.htm">2762</a>. 'The legs 
of man' stands for a person's own power to do good. 'Those who fear Jehovah' stands for people whose worship of Him is based on a love of truth, and 'those who await His mercy' stands for those whose 
worship is based on a love of good. In the Prophets when good is spoken of so also is truth, and when truth is spoken of so also is good, on account of the heavenly marriage of good and truth that 
exists in every individual part [of the Word], see <a href="683.htm">683</a>, <a href="793.htm">793</a>, <a href="801.htm">801</a>, <a href="2516.htm">2516</a>, <a href="2712.htm">2712</a>, <a href="2731.htm">2731</a>. </p>
<p></p>
<p><b>[11]</b>
 In the same author, </p>
<p>Jehovah will bless the house of Israel, He will bless the house of Aaron, He will bless 
those who fear Jehovah, both small and great. Ps. 115: <a href="12.htm">12</a>, <a href="13.htm">13</a>. </p>
<p>Here 'those who fear Jehovah' stands for people whose worship is based on the good that flows from faith, meant by 'the house of Israel', 
and on the good that flows from love, meant by 'the house of Aaron' - both of them on account of the heavenly marriage which exists, as has been stated, in every individual part of the Word. </p>
<p></p>
<p><b>[12]</b>
In Isaiah, </p>
<p>The stability<A name="fntext3"></a><A href="#fn3"><sup>c</sup></a> of your times will be strength to save, wisdom and knowledge; and the fear of Jehovah itself the treasure. Isa. 33: <a href="6.htm">6</a>. </p>
<p>Here 'wisdom and knowledge' stands for the 
good of faith joined to the truth of faith, 'the fear of Jehovah' for the good of love. In the same prophet, </p>
<p>Who among you fears Jehovah? [Who] listens to the voice of His servant? Isa. 50: <a href="10.htm">10</a>. </p>
<p>'Who 
fears Jehovah' stands for one whose worship is based on love, 'who listens to the voice of His servant' for one whose worship is based on faith. When one goes with the other the heavenly marriage 
is in that case present. </p>
<p></p>
<p><b>[13]</b>
 From these places that have been quoted from the Word it is clear that 'the fear of God' means worship based either on fear, or on the good that flows from faith, or 
on the good that flows from love. But the more there is of fear present in worship the less there is of faith, and still less of love. Conversely, the more there is of faith present in worship, and 
even more so of love, the less there is of fear. Present within all worship there is fear, but this fear takes on a different form and nature; for it is holy fear. But holy fear is not so much a fear 
of hell and of damnation, as a fear lest anything whatever be done or thought that is contrary to the Lord and contrary to the neighbour, thus anything whatever that is contrary to the good of love and 
to the truth of faith. It is an abhorrence which on the one side forms the boundary of the holiness of faith and of the holiness of love. And since, as has been stated, it is not a fear of hell and 
damnation, it exists with those who abide in the good of faith, less so with those who abide in the good of love, that is, who abide in the Lord. Therefore, </p>
<p></p>
<p><b>[14]</b>
 V Fearing also means distrusting, or 
having no faith and love. </p>
<p> As in Isaiah, </p>
<p>Thus said your Creator, O Jacob, and He who formed you, O Israel, Do not fear, for I have redeemed you, and have called you by your name; you are Mine. 
Isa. 43: <a href="1.htm">1</a>, <a href="5.htm">5</a>; 44: <a href="8.htm">8</a> </p>
<p>In Luke, </p>
<p>The oath which He swore to Abraham our father, to grant us, that without fear we, being delivered from the hand of our enemies, might serve Him, in holiness and righteousness 
before Him. Luke 1: <a href="73.htm">73</a>-<a href="75.htm">75</a>. </p>
<p>In the same gospel, </p>
<p>Do not fear, little flock, for it is your Father's good pleasure to give you the kingdom. Luke 12: <a href="32.htm">32</a>. </p>
<p>In Mark, </p>
<p>Jesus said to the 
ruler of the synagogue, Do not fear, only believe. Mark 5: <a href="36.htm">36</a>; Luke 8: <a href="49.htm">49</a>, <a href="50.htm">50</a>. </p>
<p>In the same gospel, </p>
<p>Jesus said, Why are you so afraid? How is it that you have no faith? Mark 4: <a href="40.htm">40</a>. </p>
<p>In Luke, </p>
<p>The 
hairs of your head are numbered. Do not fear, therefore; you are of more value than many sparrows. Luke 12: <a href="7.htm">7</a>. </p>
<p>In all these places 'fearing' means distrusting or having no faith and love.

`Quia nunc novi quod timeas Deum tu': quod significet glorificationem ex Amore Divino, constat a significatione `nosse' cum praedicatur de Divino Domini, quod non aliud sit quam uniri, seu quod idem, 
glorificari; uniebatur enim {1}Humanum Divino per tentationes, n. 1737, 1813; et a significatione `timere Deum,' seu timoris Dei, quod hic sit Amor Divinus; qui quia praedicatur de Rationali Divino 
Domini quoad verum, dicitur hic `timere Deum,' non timere Jehovam, cum enim agitur de vero dicitur Deus, cum de bono Jehovah, n. 2586, 2769, 2822; quod Amor Divinus sit per quem Dominus univit Essentiam 
Humanam Divinae et Divinam Humanae, seu quod idem, Se glorificavit, videatur n. 1812, 1813, 2253.  Quid `timere Deum' significet in Verbo, constare potest a locis ibi plurimis quoad sensum internum 
intellectis; {2}timor Dei ibi significat cultum, et quidem cultum vel ex timore, vel ex bono fidei, vel ex bono amoris; cultum ex timore cum agitur de non regeneratis, cultum ex bono fidei cum de regeneratis 
spiritualibus, et cultum ex bono amoris cum de regeneratis caelestibus.  [2] Quod {3}I.  Timor Dei in genere significet cultum, patet in Libro Regum,           Filii Israelis...timuerunt deos 
alios, et ambulaverunt      in statutis gentium:...gentes missae in Samariam...principio      non timuerunt Jehovam, quare misit Jehovah in eos leones;...      et venit e sacerdotibus, quos captivos 
fecerunt in Samaria, et      habitabat in Bethel, et fuit docens eos, quomodo timerent      Jehovam.... Pepigerat Jehovah foedus cum filiis Israelis, et      praeceperat eis, Non timebitis deos 
alienos, nec incurvabitis      vos eis, et non servietis eis, nec sacrificabitis eis, sed      Jehovam timebitis,...et Ipsi incurvabitis vos, et Ipsi      sacrificabitis, 2 Reg. xvii 7, 8, 24, 25, 
28, 32, 33, 35-37,      41; </p>
<p>ubi `timere' manifeste pro colere: apud Esaiam,           Propterea quod appropinquavit populus iste ore suo, et      labiis suis honoraverunt Me, et cor eorum elongavit 
se a Me,      et fuit timor eorum pro Me mandatum hominum edoctum, xxix 13; </p>
<p>ubi `timor eorum pro Me' pro cultu in genere, nam dicitur quod timor ille fuerit mandatum hominum: apud Lucam,        
   Judex quidam erat in urbe aliqua, Deum non timens, et       hominem non reverens, xviii 2; </p>
<p>`Deum non timens' pro non colens.  [3] II. Quod timor Dei significet cultum ex timore cum agitur de non 
regeneratis, patet ab his locis: apud Mosen,            Cum promulgaretur Lex super monte Sinai, dixit populus      ad Mosen, Loquere tu nobiscum, et audiemus, et ne loquatur      nobiscum Deus, ne 
forte moriamur, et dixit Moses ad      populum,... Quia propter tentare vos venit Deus, et propter ut      sit timor Ipsius super facies vestras, ne peccetis, Exod. xx      {4} 19, 20: </p>
<p>et alibi,  
         Nunc quare moriemur, quia comedit nos ignis magnus hic      si addentes nos audire vocem Jehovae Dei nostri amplius, et      moriemur;... appropinqua tu, et audi omne quod dicet Jehovah  
    Deus noster, et tu loquere ad nos, omne quod dicet Jehovah      Deus noster ad te, et audiemus, et faciemus. Et Jehovah dixit      ad Mose: Quis dabit, et erit cor eorum hoc illis ad timendum  
    Me, et ad  custodiendum omnia praecepta Mea, omnibus diebus      {5}, Deut. v 22, 24, 26 [A.V. 25, 27, 29]; </p>
<p>ibi `timor Dei super facies vestras ne peccetis,' et `cor ad timendum Me, et ad custodiendum 
omnia praecepta Mea' significat cultum ex timore respective ad illos quia tales; qui enim in cultu externo sunt, nullo interno, per timorem ad observantiam legis et' obsequium feruntur, sed usque 
non veniunt in cultum internum seu in timore sanctum, nisi in bono vitae sint, et sciant quid internum, et credant: apud eundem,           Si non serves ad faciendum omnia verba Legis hujus     
  scripta in Libro hoc, ad timendum nomen honorabile et      terribile hoc Jehovam Deum tuum, mirabiles reddet Jehovah      plagas tuas, et plagas seminis tui, plagas magnas et certas,      et morbos 
malos et certos, et reducet in te omnem languorem      Aegypti, a quibus times tibi, et haerebunt in te, Deut. xxviii      58-60; </p>
<p>hic quoque `timere nomen honorabile et terribile Jehovam Deum' est 
colere ex timore, quod ut esset apud tales, omnia mala usque ad maledictiones {6}tribuebantur Jehovae, n. 592, 2335, 2395, 2447: apud Jeremiam,           Castigabit te malitia tua, et aversiones tuae  
    corripient et scito et vide, quod malum et amarum relinquere      te Jehovam Deum tuum, et non pavorem Mei esse in te, ii 19: </p>
<p>apud Lucam,           Dico vobis, Ne timete vobis ab iis qui 
occidunt corpus,      postea autem non habent amplius quid facere; monstrabo autem      vobis, quem timere debeatis, timete Ipsum, qui postquam      occidit potestatem habet injiciendi in gehennam, 
immo dico      vobis, Hunc timete, xii 4, 5; Matth. x 28; </p>
<p>hic quoque `timere Deum' involvit cultum ex aliquo timore, quia timor adigebat eos ad {7}obsequium, ut dictum.  [4] III.  Quod timere Deum 
seu Jehovam significet cultum ex bono fidei, ubi agitur de regeneratis spiritualibus, patet ex his locis, apud Mosen           Rex scribet sibi exemplar Legis hujus super Libro coram      sacerdotibus 
Levitis, et erit cum illo, et leget in illo      omnibus diebus vitae suae, propterea ut discat timere Jehovam      Deum suum, ad servandum omnia verba Legis hujus, et statuta      haec ad faciendum 
illa, Deut. xvii [18], 19;  `rex' in sensu interno pro vero fidei, regium enim repraesentabat regnum Domini spirituale, n. 1672, 1728, 2015, 2069, inde `timere Jehovam Deum suam' est colere Ipsum 
ex vero fidei, quod quia inseparabile est a bono charitatis, describitur per `servare verba legis et statuta ad faciendum illa': apud Samuelem,            Ecce dedit Jehovah super vos regem, si timueritis 
      Jehovam, et serviveritis Ipsi, et auscultaveritis voci      Ipsius,... eritis etiam vos, et etiam rex qui regnat super      vos, post Jehovam Deum vestrum, I Sam. xii [13], 14; </p>
<p>hic quoque 
in sensu interno `timere Jehovam' pro colere ex bono et vero fidei, ut prius, quia agitur de rege seu regio: [5] apud Joshuam,            Nunc timete Jehovam, et servite Ipsi in integritate et  
    {8}veritate, et removete deos, quibus serviverunt patres      vestri, xxiv 14; </p>
<p>ubi etiam `timere Jehovam' pro colere ex bono et vero, quod est hominis spiritualis, `integritas' enim praedicatur 
de bono fidei, n. 612, `veritas' de vero fidei: apud Jeremiam,            Erunt Mihi in populum, et Ego ero eis in Deum, et dabo      eis cor unum, et viam unam, ad timendum Me omnibus diebus, ad  
    bonum eis et filiis eorum post illos, et pangam eis foedus      saeculi, quod non revertar a post illos, ad benefaciendum eis,      et timorem Meum dabo in cor eorum, pro non recedere a Me,  
    xxxii [38], 39, 40; </p>
<p>quod hic `timere Deum' sit colere ex bono et vero fidei, constare potest a serie, et ex eo quod dicatur `populus' ac `Deus;' quod `populus' praedicetur de illis qui in vero fidei 
sunt, videatur n. 1259, 1260, quod `Deus' dicatur ubi agitur de vero, n. 2586, 2769, 2807 f.: apud Esaiam,            Honorabunt Te populus robustus, urbs gentium validarum      timebunt Te, xxv 
3;  ubi etiam `timere Deum' pro colere ex vero spirituali; praedicatur enim de `populo' et de `urbe'; quod `urbs' sit doctrinale verum, videatur n. 402, 2268, 2449, 2451: [6] apud Davidem,         
  Quis hic vir timens Jehovae, docebit illum viam quam       eligat, Ps. xxv 12; </p>
<p>ubi `vir timens Jehovae' pro colente Ipsum; quod de spirituali homine patet inde quod dicatur, `docebit illum viam'; 
quod `via' sit verum videatur n. 627, 2333: apud eundem,           Beatus omnis timens Jehovae, ambulans in viis Ipsius       Ps. cxxviii. I; </p>
<p>similiter: apud eundem,           Timentes Jehovam glorificabunt 
Ipsum, omne semen Jacob      glorificabunt Ipsum, et metuent ab Ipso omne semen Israelis      Ps. xxii 24 [A.V. 23]; </p>
<p>ubi `metuere ab Ipso' pro colere ex vero fidei, `semen enim Israelis 
est spirituale Ecclesiae, seu {9}bonum et verum fidei, n. 1025, 1447, 1610: apud Mosen,           Nunc Israel, quid Jehovah Deus tuus petens a te, quin       ad timendum Jehovam Deum tuum, ad ambulandum 
in omnibus viis      Ipsius, et ad amandum Ipsum, et ad serviendum Jehovae Deo tuo,      in toto corde tuo, et in tota anima tua, ad servandum      praecepta Jehovae, et statuta Ipsius?  Deut. 
x 12, 13; </p>
<p>ibi describitur quid est `timere Deum' apud spiritualem hominem qui est `Israel,' nempe quod sit `ambulare in viis Jehovae, amare Ipsum, servire Ipsi, et servare praecepta et statuta': apud 
Johannem,           Vidi angelum volantem in medio caeli, habentem      evangelium aeternum,...dicentem voce magna, Timete Deum, et      date Ipsi gloriam, quia venit hora judicii Ipsius, Apoc. xiv  
    6, 7; </p>
<p>ibi `timere Deum' pro cultu sancto ex bono et vero fidei: apud Lucam,           Jesus dixit paralytico, Surge et tollens lectum tuum       abi in domum tuam,...unde stupor invasit omnes, 
et      glorificabant Deum, et impleti sunt timore, v 24-26; </p>
<p>ubi `timor' pro timore sancto, qualis illorum qui per verum fide initiantur in bonum amoris.  [7] IV. Quod timere Deum seu Jehovam significet 
cultum ex bono amoris, cum agitur de regeneratis caelestibus apud Malachiam,           Foedus Meum fuit cum Levi vitarum et pacis, et dedi e       illi timore, et timuit Me, et pro nomine 
Meo {10}contritus est      ille, lex veritatis fuit in ore illius, et perversitas non in      labiis ejus in pace et rectitudine ambulavit Mecum, ii 5, 6; </p>
<p>ubi de Domino, Qui hic est `Levi' in sensu 
interno; `Levi' significat sacerdotium, et significat amorem; `timor' ibi pro bono Divini amoris, `lex veritatis' pro vero illius, `pax et rectitudo' pro utroque: [8] apud Esaiam,           Egredietur 
virga e stirpe Jishaii, et surculus e      radicibus ejus crescet, et requiescet super Ipso spiritus      Jehovae, spiritus sapientiae et intelligentiae, spiritus      consilii et fortitudinis, 
spiritus scientiae et timoris      Jehovae, et {11}odorari Ipsius in timore Jehovae, xi 1-3; </p>
<p>ubi etiam de Domino; `spiritus scientiae et timoris Jehovae' pro Divino amore veri, `odorari Ipsius in timore 
Jehovae' pro Divino amore boni: [9] apud Davidem,           Praecepta Jehovae recta, laetificantia cor, praeceptum      Jehovae purum illuminans oculos, timor Jehovae mundus stans in      perpetuum, 
judicia Jehovae veritas, justificata una, Ps. xix      9, 10 [A.V. 8, 9]; </p>
<p>ubi `timor Jehovae mundus' pro amore, `judicia Jehovae veritas' pro fide; quod `justitia' praedicetur de bono quod est 
amoris, `judicia' de vero quod est fidei, videatur n. 2235, quae `justificata una' dicuntur, cura verum sit bonum, seu cum fides sit charitas: [10] apud eundem,            Ecce oculus Jehovae ad timentes 
Ipsum, ad exspectantes      misericordiam Ipsius, Ps. xxxiii 18: </p>
<p>et alibi,           Jehovah non in fortitudine equi delectatur, non in      cruribus viri placet; placitum Jehovae in timentibus 
Ipsum, et      exspectantibus misericordiam Ipsius, Ps. cxlvii 10, 11; </p>
<p>`fortitudo equi' pro {12}propria potentia verum cogitandi; quod `equus' sit intellectuale, videatur n. 2760-2762; `crura viri' 
pro {13}propria potentia bonum faciendi, `timentes Jehovam' pro colentibus Ipsum ex amore veri, et `exspectantes misericordiam Ipsius' pro colentibus ex amore boni; ubi apud Prophetas de bono, etiam 
de vero, et ubi de vero, etiam de bono, dicitur, ob conjugium caeleste boni et veri in singulis, videatur n. 683, 793, 801, 2516, 2712, 2731: [11] apud eundem,            Jehovah benedicet domui 
Israelis, benedicet domui       Aharonis, benedicet timentibus Jehovam parvis cum magnis, Ps.      cxv 12, 13; </p>
<p>hic `timentes Jehovam' pro colentibus ex bono fidei, quod est `domus Israelis,' et ex 
bono amoris, quod est `domus Aharonis,' utrumque ob conjugium caeleste in singulis Verbi, ut dictum: [12] apud Esaiam,            Erit veritas temporum tuorum robur salutum, sapientia      et scientia, 
et timor Jehovae ipse thesaurus, xxxiii 6; </p>
<p>ubi `sapientia et scientia' pro bono fidei conjuncto cum ejus vero,`timor Jehovae' pro bono amoris: apud eundem,           Quis in vobis timens Jehovae, 
auscultans voci servi      Ipsius, l 10; </p>
<p>`timens Jehovae' pro colente ex amore, `auscultans voci servi Ipsius: pro colente ex fide; cum unum est alterius, tunc est conjugium caeleste.  [13] Ex his 
quae allata sunt ex Verbo, constare potest quod `timor Dei' sit cultus vel ex timore, vel ex bono fidei, vel ex bono amoris; {14}ast quanto plus timoris est in cultu, tanto minus est fidei, et tanto 
adhuc minus amoris {15}; et vicissim, quanto plus fidei est in cultu, et adhuc magis quanto plus amoris, tanto minus timoris est; inest quidem omni cultui timor, sed sub alia specie et alio habitu, est 
timor sanctus: sed timor sanctus non ita est timor pro inferno {16}et pro damnatione sed ne quicquam faciant aut cogitent contra Dominum et contra proximum, ita ne quicquam contra bonum amoris et verum 
fidei est aversatio, quae est limes sancti fidei et sancti amoris ab una parte {17}et quia non timor pro inferno et damnatione, ut dictum, est illi qui in bono fidei, minus qui in bono amoris sunt, 
hoc est, qui in Domino, ideo [14] V. Timere etiam significat diffidere, aut fidem {16}et amorem non habere, ut apud Esaiam,           Sic dixit Creator tuus, Jacob, et Formator tuus,      Israel, 
Ne timeto, quia redemi te, vocavi nomine tuo, Mihi tu,      xliii 1, 5; xliv 8: </p>
<p>apud Lucam,           Juramentum, quod juravit Abrahamo patri nostro, daturum      nobis, ut {18}sine timore e manu 
hostium nostrorum erepti,      serviamus Ipsi in sanctitate et justitia coram Ipso, i 73, 74      [75]: </p>
<p>apud eundem,           Ne time tibi, parve grex, quia placuit Patri vestro       vobis dare 
regnum, xii 32: </p>
<p>apud Marcum,           Jesus dixit archisynagogo, Ne timeto, modo crede, v 36; </p>
<p>     Luc. viii 49, 50: </p>
<p>{19}apud eundem,           Jesus dixit, Quid timidi estis adeo?  quomodo non

<p>apud Lucam,           Pili capitis vestri numerati sunt, ideo ne timete,       multis passeribus praestantiores estis, xii 7: </p>
