<h3 align="center" class="ired">属天的奥秘 第2296节</h3>
<h4 align="center"></h4><p><strong>2296.</strong>我还被指示这一切是如何通过适合来世小孩子天性的快乐迷人之物被灌入的。我曾被允许看见孩子们穿着最漂亮的衣服，胸间和稚嫩的手臂上戴着因最迷人的天堂色彩而绚丽夺目的花环。某次我还被允许看见小孩子们与他们的少女家庭教师在一座天堂花园中。园中的树木不像月桂树和由此形成的凉亭那么多，这个花园也非常美丽，里面铺有通向更深处的小路。我还看到穿戴上述服装的小孩子们本人，当他们进入花园时，入口上面的鲜花拱门发出至为快乐的光芒。由此可见孩子们拥有怎样的快乐，又是如何藉着快乐迷人之物而被引入纯真与仁爱的福分之中的。而纯真与仁爱不断被主注入到这些快乐迷人之物中。</p>

The manner in which all things are insinuated into the little ones of the other life by means of delightful and pleasant things suited to their genius, has also been shown me; for I have been permitted 
to see the little children most beautifully clothed, having their bosoms and tender arms encircled with garlands of flowers that were resplendent with the most pleasing and heavenly colors. Once also 
I was permitted to see the little children with their maiden educatresses in a paradisal garden, that consisted not so much of trees, as of laurel espaliers and of bowers thus formed; beautifully laid 
out with paths that led toward the more interior parts; and I also saw the little children themselves, clothed as above described; and when they entered the garden the flower arch above the entrance 
shone most joyously. From this we can see the nature of their deliciousnesses, and also that by means of pleasant and delightful things they are introduced into the goods of innocence and charity, 
which are continually being insinuated by the Lord into those delightful and pleasant things. </p>

The way in which everything is instilled into them by means of delightful and pleasant things suited to their disposition has also been shown to me, for I have been allowed to see the young children 
clothed most gorgeously. Around the breast they had a garland of flowers that were a blaze of most lovely and heavenly colours, and garlands in addition around their tender little arms. On one occasion 
I was also allowed to see young children together with virgins who were their governesses in a paradise garden. The garden consisted not so much of trees as of what looked like laurel pergolas, and 
so of covered parts, and was also very beautifully laid out with paths leading to the more interior parts. I also saw the young children themselves clothed in the same way as those described already, 
and when they entered the garden the festoon of flowers above the entrance shone in a most cheerful way. All this makes clear the nature of the things that delight them, as also does the fact that by 
means of things that give them pleasure and delight they are led to the goods that belong to the innocence and charity that are being instilled by the Lord unceasingly into those things in which they 
delight and take pleasure. </p>

</p><b>2296.</b>
Quomodo omnia illis insinuantur per jucunda et amoena quae genio eorum conveniunt, mihi etiam ostensum est; datum enim videre infantes decoratissime amictos, circum pectus sertis florum ex amoenissimis 
et caelestibus coloribus splendescentium, et praeterea circum tenera eorum brachia: quondam etiam videre datum infantes cum virginibus eorum educatricibus in horto paradisiaco, non ita ex arboribus 
sed ex transtris quasi laureis, et sic porticibus, ornatissimo cum viis adituum versus interiora; et ipsos infantes similiter tunc amictos, et cum intrabant, floretum supra introitum laetissime exsplendescebat; 
inde quales illis deliciae, constare potest, tum {1} quod per amoena et jucunda' introducantur in bona innocentiae et charitatis, quae jucundis illis et amoenis jugiter a Domino insinuantur. 	@1 
et quomodo per jucunda et amoena.$ </p>
