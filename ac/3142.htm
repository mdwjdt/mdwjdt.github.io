<h3 align="center" class="ired">属天的奥秘 第3142节</h3>
<h4 align="center"></h4><p><strong>3142.</strong>“我已经打扫了房间”表一切事物都已预备好并充满良善。这从“打扫”和“房间”的含义清楚可知：“打扫”是指预备并充满，如下文所述；“房间”（house或译家）是指良善，如前所述（<a href="2233.htm">2233</a>，<a href="2234.htm">2234</a>，<a href="2559.htm">2559</a>节）。人自己凭主导他的良善而被称为一个房间或一个家（<a href="3128.htm">3128</a>节）。“打扫”表示预备并充满，其原因在于：除了打扫房间，也就是拒绝恶欲和由此产生的谬念外，对人并没有其它任何要求。他若这样行，便充满各种良善，因为良善不断从主流入。它流入这“房间”，即流入从诸如阻碍流注，也就是弹回，或败坏、或窒息所流入的良善之类的事物中洁净的人里面。因此，古人常常说打扫或预备房间，还说清除并预备道路。“打扫房间”表示将人的自我从恶中洁净，从而为良善的进入预备人的自我；“清除道路”表示预备人的自我，以便真理能被接受。“房间”表良善（<a href="3128.htm">3128</a>节），“道路”表真理（<a href="627.htm">627</a>，<a href="2333.htm">2333</a>节）。<br />如以赛亚书：<br />在旷野有人声喊着说，预备（清扫）耶和华的路，在沙漠为我们的神修直大道。（以赛亚书<a href="http://39-27.cn/赛40.3.htm">40:3</a>）<br />同一先知书：<br />填高！填高！清除（预备）道路，将绊脚石从我百姓的路中除掉！（以赛亚书<a href="http://39-27.cn/赛57.14.htm">57:14</a>）<br /><br />你们要经过，要从城门经过，清除（预备）百姓的路；填高，填高大道，捡去石头。（以赛亚书<a href="http://39-27.cn/赛62.10.htm">62:10</a>）<br />玛拉基书：<br />看哪，我要差遣我的使者在我前面清除（预备）道路；你们所寻求的主，必忽然进入祂的殿。（玛拉基书<a href="http://39-27.cn/玛3.1.htm">3:1</a>）<br />在这些经文中，“清除道路”表使自己做好准备，预备接受真理。其中所论述的主题是主的到来，因为他们要预备自己接受信之真理，并由此接受仁之良善，再由这良善接受永生。<br />诗篇：<br />你从埃及挪出一棵葡萄树，赶出外族人，把这树栽上。你在它面前清除杂物，它就深深扎根，蔓延满地。（诗篇<a href="http://39-27.cn/诗80.8.htm">80:8</a>-<a href="http://39-27.cn/诗80.9.htm">9</a>）<br />就至高意义而言，此处论述的是主。“从埃及挪出的一棵葡萄树”是指基于记忆知识的真理；“赶出外族人”是指从恶中洁净；“在它面前清除杂物”是指做好准备，以便良善可以充满它。在反面意义上，“打扫房间”也论及丧失一切良善与真理，从而充满邪恶与虚假的人。如路加福音：<br />污灵找不到安歇之处，便说，我要回到我所出来的屋里去；到了，就看见里面打扫干净，修饰好了；便去另带了七个比自己更恶的灵来，都进去住在那里。（路加福音<a href="http://39-27.cn/路11.24.htm">11:24</a>-<a href="http://39-27.cn/路11.26.htm">26</a>；马太福音<a href="http://39-27.cn/太12.43.htm">12:43</a>-<a href="http://39-27.cn/太12.45.htm">45</a>）</p>

For I have swept the house. That this signifies that all things were prepared, and full of goods, is evident from the signification of "sweeping," as being to prepare and to be filled (of which we shall 
speak presently); and from the signification of a "house" as being good (concerning which above, n. 2233, 2234, 2559; and that man himself, from the good which is in him, is called a house, n. 3128). 
The reason "to sweep" signifies to prepare and to be filled, is that nothing else is required of man than to sweep the house; that is, to reject the cupidities of evil and the derivative persuasions 
of falsity; for he is then filled with goods, because good is continually flowing in from the Lord-but into "the house," that is, into the man who is purified from such things as impede the influx, 
that is, which reflect, or pervert, or suffocate the inflowing good. Hence it was common with the ancients to speak of sweeping or cleaning the house, and of sweeping and preparing the way; and by sweeping 
the house was meant to purify one's self from evils, and thereby to prepare one's self for goods to enter; but by sweeping the way was meant to prepare one's self so that truths might be received 
(for by a "house" was signified good, n. 3128; and by a "way," truth, n. 627, 2333). [2] As in Isaiah: </p>
<p>     The voice of one crying in the wilderness, Sweep [prepare] ye the way of Jehovah; make straight 
in the desert a highway for our God (Isa. 40:3). In the same: </p>
<p>     Cast up, cast up, sweep [prepare] the way, take away the stumbling-block out of the way of My people (Isa. 57:14). Again: </p>
<p> 
    Go through, go through the gates, sweep [prepare] the way of the people; cast up, cast up the highway, gather out the stones (Isa. 62:10). In Malachi: </p>
<p>     Behold I send Mine angel, and He shall 
sweep [prepare] the way before Me; and the Lord, whom ye seek, shall suddenly come to his temple (Mal. 3:1). In these passages, to "sweep the way" signifies to make themselves ready and prepare to 
receive truth. The subject treated of therein is the advent of the Lord, for which they were to prepare themselves for receiving the truth of faith, and thereby the good of charity, and by this eternal 
salvation. [3] In David: </p>
<p>     Thou hast brought a vine out of Egypt, Thou didst drive out the nations and plantedst it; Thou didst sweep before it, and didst cause its root to be rooted, and it filled 
the land (Ps. 80:8-9); </p>
<p>where in the supreme sense the Lord is treated of; the "vine out of Egypt" is truth from memory-knowledges; "driving out the nations" is purifying from evils; "sweeping before 
it," is making ready so that goods may fill. In the opposite sense "to sweep the house" is said also of the man who deprives himself of all goods and truths, and thus is filled with evils and falsities; 
as in Luke: </p>
<p>     The unclean spirit, finding no rest, says, I will return into my house whence I came out; and when he is come he findeth it swept and garnished; then goeth he and taketh to 
him seven other spirits worse than himself, and they enter in and dwell there (Luke 11:24-26; Matt. 12:43-45). </p>

<p align="center"><b>Elliott(1983-1999) 3142</b></p><p><b>3142.</b>
'And I have swept the house' means all things had been prepared and filled with goods. This is clear from the meaning of 'sweeping' as preparing and being filled, dealt with immediately below, and from 
the meaning of 'a house' as good, dealt with in <a href="2233.htm">2233</a>, <a href="2234.htm">2234</a>, <a href="2559.htm">2559</a>. And a person himself, from the good which governs him, is called a house, <a href="3128.htm">3128</a>. The reason why 'sweeping' means preparing and being 
filled is that nothing else is asked of anyone except to 'sweep his house', that is, to reject evil desires and resulting false persuasions. If he does this he is filled with all forms of good, for good 
from the Lord is constantly flowing in. It flows into 'the house', that is, into the person who has been cleansed of such things as hinder influx, that is, which turn away, or pervert, or stifle inflowing 
good. Hence the proverbial expression used by the ancients about sweeping or cleansing the house, and also about sweeping and preparing the way. 'Sweeping the house' was used to mean cleansing 
oneself of evils and thereby preparing oneself for goods to enter, while 'sweeping the way' was used to mean preparing oneself for the reception of truths; for 'a house' meant good, <a href="3128.htm">3128</a>, and 'the way' 
truth, <a href="627.htm">627</a>, <a href="2333.htm">2333</a>. </p>
<p></p>
<p><b>[2]</b>
 As in Isaiah, </p>
<blockquote>
The voice of one crying in the wilderness, Sweep (prepare) the way of Jehovah; make straight in the lonely place a highway for our God. <a href="http://bible.gospelcom.net/cgi-bin/bible?passage=Isa%2040:3&amp;version=ESV&amp;interface=print&amp;showfn=yes&amp;showxref">Isa 40:3</a>. 
</blockquote>
<p>In the 
same prophet, </p>
<blockquote>
Level out, level out, sweep (prepare) the way; remove the stumbling block from My people's way. <a href="http://bible.gospelcom.net/cgi-bin/bible?passage=Isa%2057:14&amp;version=ESV&amp;interface=print&amp;showfn=yes&amp;showxref">Isa 57:14</a>. 
</blockquote>
<p>In the same prophet, </p>
<blockquote>
Go through, go through into the gates; sweep 
(prepare) the way of the people. Level out, level out the way; gather out the stones. <a href="http://bible.gospelcom.net/cgi-bin/bible?passage=Isa%2062:10&amp;version=ESV&amp;interface=print&amp;showfn=yes&amp;showxref">Isa 62:10</a>. 
</blockquote>
<p>In Malachi, </p>
<blockquote>
Behold, I am sending My angel, and he will sweep (prepare) the way before Me; and suddenly 
there will come to His temple the Lord whom you are seeking. <a href="http://bible.gospelcom.net/cgi-bin/bible?passage=Mal%203:1&amp;version=ESV&amp;interface=print&amp;showfn=yes&amp;showxref">Mal 3:1</a>. 
</blockquote>
<p>In these places 'sweeping the way' stands for getting oneself ready and preparing to receive truth. They refer to the Lord's 
coming, for which people were to prepare themselves so as to receive the truth of faith, and through that the good of charity, and through this in turn eternal salvation. </p>
<p></p>
<p><b>[3]</b>
 In David, </p>
<blockquote>
You 
caused a vine to journey out of Egypt. You cast out the nations, and You planted it, You swept before it and caused its root to be rooted, and it filled the land. <a href="http://bible.gospelcom.net/cgi-bin/bible?passage=Ps%2080:8,%209&amp;version=ESV&amp;interface=print&amp;showfn=yes&amp;showxref">Ps 80:8, 9</a>. 
</blockquote>
<p>This refers in the highest 
sense to the Lord. 'A vine out of Egypt' is truth based on facts, 'casting out the nations' cleansing from evils, 'sweeping before it' preparing for goods to fill it. 'Sweeping the house' also 
means in the contrary sense the person who dispossesses himself of all goods and truths and so is filled with evils and falsities, as in Luke, </p>
<blockquote>
If the unclean spirit finds no rest he says, I will return 
to my house out of which I came. And if when he comes he finds it swept and decorated, he goes away and brings seven other spirits more evil than himself, and they enter in and dwell there. <a href="http://bible.gospelcom.net/cgi-bin/bible?passage=Luke%2011:24-26&amp;version=ESV&amp;interface=print&amp;showfn=yes&amp;showxref">Luke 11:24-26</a>; <a href="http://bible.gospelcom.net/cgi-bin/bible?passage=Matt%2012:43-45&amp;version=ESV&amp;interface=print&amp;showfn=yes&amp;showxref">Matt 12:43-45</a>.

</p><b>3142.</b>
`Et ego veri domum': quod significet omnia parata et plena bonis esse, constat (c)a significatione `verrere' quod sit parare et impleri, de qua mox; et ex significatione `domus' quod sit bonum, de qua 
n. 2233, 2234, 2559, et quod ipse homo, ex bono quod in illo, dicatur `domus', n. 3128: quod `verrere' sit parare et impleri, inde est quia nihil aliud ab homine requiritur quam ut `vertat domum,' 
hoc est, rejiciat cupiditates mali et persuasiones falsi inde, tunc impletur ille bonis, nam bonum a Domino continue influit, sed in domum, seu in hominem purgatum a talibus quae influxum impediunt, hoc 
est, `quae' bonum influum reflectunt, vel pervertunt, vel suffocat; inde formula antiquis fuit, {1}verrere seu purgare domum, tum vertere et parare viam; et per `verrere domum' intellectum est se purgare 
a malis, et sic se praeparare ut bona intrent; at per `verrere viam' intellectum est se parare ut vera recipiantur; nam per `domum' significatum fuit bonum, n. 3128, et per `viam' verum, n. 627, 
2333; [2] ut apud Esaiam,           Vox clamantis in deserto, Verrite (parate) viam Jehovae,      et rectam facite in solitudine semitam Deo nostro, xl 3: </p>
<p>apud eundem,           Sternite, sternite, 
verrite (parate) viam, removete      offendiculum a via populi Mei, lvii 14: </p>
<p>apud eundem,           Transite, transite in portas, verrite (parate) viam      populi; sternite, sternite viam, elapidate 
e lapide, lxii 10: </p>
<p>apud Malachiam,           Ecce Ego mittens angelum Meum, et verret (parabit) viam      coram Me, et subito veniet ad templum Dominus, quem vos      quaerentes, iii 1; </p>
<p>illis 
in locis `verrere viam' pro parare se et praeparare ad recipiendum verum; agitur ibi de adventu Domini, ad quem se praepararent ad recipiendum verum fidei, et per illud bonum charitatis, et per hoc 
salutem aeternam: [3] apud Davidem,           Vitem ex Aegypto proficisci fecisti, expulisti gentes, et      plantasti illam, verristi coram illa, et radicari fecisti      radicem ejus, et implevit 
terram, Ps. lxxx 9, 10 [A.V. 8, 9]; </p>
<p>ibi in sensu supremo de Domino; `vitis ex Aegypto' est verum ex scientificis, `expellere gentes' est purgare a malis, `vertere coram illa' est parare ut bona impleant. 
{2} `Verrere domum' etiam in opposito sensu significat hominem, qui deprivat se ab omnibus bonis et veris, et sic impletur malis et falsis, ut apud Lucam,            Immundus spiritus requiem 
si non invenit, dicit, Revertar      in domum meam, unde egressus sum, quam si veniens invenit      scopis purgatam et ornatam, tunc abit, et assumit septem alios      spiritus se pejores, et ingressi 
habitant ibi, xi 24-26; </p>
<p>     Matth. xii 43-45. @1 Heb.     (panah and Lat. verrere are not necessarily connected with brooms or brushes.  The former, and probably the latter, has the meaning 
`to turn,' hence `to turn out (rubbish, etc.)' and so `to put in order,' or `to prepare.'$  @2 i radicare radicem et implere terram est fructificatio in infinitum$  </p>
