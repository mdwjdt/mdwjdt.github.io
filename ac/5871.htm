<h3 align="center" class="ired">属天的奥秘 第5871节</h3>
<h4 align="center"></h4><p><strong>5871.</strong>“叫各人都离开我出去”表不一致和相矛盾的记忆知识要从中心被逐出。这从“离开他的各人”的含义清楚可知，“离开他的各人”是指记忆知识，因为这些人是埃及人，“埃及人”表示记忆知识（参看<a href="1164.htm">1164</a>，<a href="1165.htm">1165</a>，<a href="1186.htm">1186</a>，<a href="1462.htm">1462</a>，<a href="5700.htm">5700</a>，<a href="5702.htm">5702</a>节）。由于这些知识被逐出，故可知它们是不一致和相矛盾的。此中情形是这样：当外在人或属世人中的真理与内在人中的良善联结时，也就是说，当信之真理与仁之良善联结时，一切不一致，尤其相矛盾的记忆知识就会从中心被逐到边缘，因而从中心的光明被逐到边缘的阴暗。当这种情形发生时，这些知识部分被忽视了，部分则被视为毫无价值。不过，一致与和谐的记忆知识则通过一种提取，可以说通过一种升华保留下来；事物的内在意义便从这些知识获得，人在肉体中时若不通过某种愉悦的感觉，如黎明时所体验的那种愉悦，就觉察不到内在意义。这就是信之真理与仁之良善实现联结的方式。</p>

<p align="center"><b>Potts(1905-1910) 5871</b></p><p><b>5871.</b>
Cause every man to go out from with me. That this signifies that memory-knowledges, not in agreement and adverse, should be cast out from the midst, is evident from the signification of "every man from 
with him," as being memory-knowledges, for the men were Egyptians, by whom are signified memory-knowledges (see n. 1164, 1165, 1186, 1462, 5700, 5702). That these were not in agreement and were adverse, 
follows, because they were cast out. The case herein is this. When a conjunction is being effected of the truths which are in the external or natural man with the good which is in the internal, 
that is, when the truths of faith are being conjoined with the good of charity, then all those memory-knowledges which are not in agreement, and especially those which are adverse, are rejected from the 
midst to the sides, thus from the light which is in the midst to the shade which is at the sides; and then they are partly not seen and partly regarded as of no account. But from the memory-knowledges 
which are in agreement and harmonious, which remain, there is effected a kind of extraction, and so to speak a sort of sublimation, whence arises an interior sense of things, a sense which is not 
perceived by man while he is in the body except by somewhat of gladness, as the mind is gladdened by the morning of the day. Thus is effected the conjunction of the truth which is of faith with the good 
which is of charity. </p>

<p align="center"><b>Elliott(1983-1999) 5871</b></p><p><b>5871.</b>
'Make every man go out from me' means that incompatible and contradictory factual knowledge was to be cast away from the centre. This is clear from the meaning of 'every man from him' as factual knowledge, 
for the men were Egyptians, and by 'Egyptians' is meant factual knowledge, see <a href="1164.htm">1164</a>, <a href="1165.htm">1165</a>, <a href="1186.htm">1186</a>, <a href="1462.htm">1462</a>, <a href="5700.htm">5700</a>, <a href="5702.htm">5702</a>; and since it was cast aside it follows that it was incompatible and contradictory. 
For the situation is this: When the truths present in the external or natural man become joined to the good present in the internal man - that is, when the truths of faith are joined to the good 
of charity - all factual knowledge which is incompatible, and especially that which is contradictory, is cast away from the centre to the sides, thus from the light in the centre to the shadowy parts 
at the sides. When this happens that knowledge is in part disregarded and in part treated as valueless. But from the remaining factual knowledge which is compatible and harmonious, a kind of extraction 
- or if one can use the expression, a kind of distillation - takes place, from which the inner meaning of things is obtained, a meaning that no one perceives while in the body except through some joyful 
feeling, like that experienced at daybreak. Such is the way in which the joining of the truth of faith to the good of charity is effected. </p>

</p><b>5871.</b>
`Exire facite omnem virum ab apud me': quod significet {1}scientifica non congrua et adversantia e medio ejicerentur, constat a significatione `omnis viri ab apud illum' quod sint scientifica, erant 
enim Aegyptii, per quos quod scientifica significentur, videatur n. 1164, 1165, 1186, 1462, 5700, 5702; quod non congrua et adversantia, sequitur, quia ejecta sunt. Cum hoc ita se habet: quando conjunctio 
fit verorum quae in externo seu naturali homine, cum bono quod in interno, hoc est, cum vera fidei conjunguntur cum bono charitatis, tunc omnia illa scientifica quae non congruunt, et magis quae 
adversantur, e medio ad latera rejiciuntur, ita a luce quae in medio ad umbras quae ad latera; et tunc partim non spectantur, partim pro nihilo habentur; ex scientificis autem {2}quae congrua et concordantia 
quae manent, fit quasi extractio, et si ita dicere liceat, quasi sublimatio, unde rerum sensus interior, qui ab homine dum in corpore non percipitur, nisi per aliquod {3} laetum, sicut animus 
a mane diei; ita fit conjunctio veri quod fidei, cum bono quod charitatis. @1 see p. 337, ftnote 2$ @2 congruis et concordantis$ @3 i contentum aut$ </p>
