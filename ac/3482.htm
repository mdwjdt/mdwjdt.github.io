<h3 align="center" class="ired">属天的奥秘 第3482节</h3>
<h4 align="center"></h4><p><strong>3482.</strong>尽管圣言所使用的语言在人类看来似乎很简单，在某些经文中甚至比较粗糙，但它的确是天使的语言本身，不过是最低级形式的那类。因为当属灵的天使语言落入人类的词句时，它只能落入此类语言中。其中每一个事物都是代表，每一句话都具有一个含义。由于古人与灵人并天使直接交流，所以他们没有其它语言。他们的语言充满代表，每句话都具有属灵之义。而且，古人的书籍就是以这种方式写成的，因为以这种方式交谈和写作就是其智慧的目标。由此也明显可知，后来的人距离天堂何等遥远。如今，人们甚至不知道除了显现在字面上的事物外，圣言还有什么，就连其中属灵之义都不知道。凡超出字义的话都被冠以秘密，并仅仅以这个理由而被拒绝。这也解释了为何与天堂的交流如今被中断了，以致几乎没有人相信天堂的存在。说来奇怪，比起简单人，相信它的博学之士要少得多。</p>

Although the language used in the Word to man appears simple, and in some passages unpolished, it is the angelic language itself, but in its lowest form; for when the angelic speech, which is spiritual, 
falls into human words, it cannot fall into any other speech than such as this; every single thing therein being representative, and every single word being significative. As the ancients had interaction 
with spirits and angels, they had no other speech than this, which was full of representatives, and in every expression of which there was a spiritual sense. The books of the ancients were also 
written in this way; for it was the study of their wisdom so to speak and so to write. From this also it is evident how far man afterwards removed himself from heaven. At this day he does not even know 
that there is in the Word anything else than that which appears in the letter; not even that there is a spiritual sense within; and whatever is said beyond the literal sense is called mystical, and 
is rejected merely on this account. Hence also it is that communication with heaven is at this day intercepted, insomuch that few believe there is any heaven, and wonderful to say, among the learned 
and erudite much fewer than among the simple. </p>

Although the language used in the Word appears to mankind to be simple, and in some places crude, it is angelic language itself, though in its lowest form. For when angelic language, which is spiritual, 
falls into human expressions it cannot fall into any other type of language than this. Individual things are representative, and individual expressions carry a meaning. Since they were in direct communication 
with spirits and angels the ancients possessed no other kind of language. Their language was full of representatives, and a spiritual sense was present in each expression. Also, the books 
of the ancients were written in the same fashion, for talking and writing in that fashion was the aim of their wisdom. How far mankind has since then retreated from heaven becomes clear from this as 
well. At present it does not even know that the Word includes anything apart from that which is seen in the letter, not even that there is a spiritual sense in it. Whatever is said to lie beyond the literal 
sense is termed mystical, which solely on these grounds is rejected. This also explains why at the present day communication with heaven has been interrupted, so much so that few believe in the 
existence of any heaven at all. Indeed, amazing to say, far fewer of the learned and scholarly than of the simple believe in it. </p>

Loquela quae in Verbo, tametsi coram homine simplex, et aliquibus in locis rudis, apparet, est {1}ipsa loquela angelica, sed ultima; loquela enim angelica, quae spiritualis est, dum cadit in voces humanas, 
non in aliam loquelam cadere potest quam in talem, singulae enim res ibi repraesentant, et singulae voces significant; antiquis quia commercium habebant cum spiritibus et angelis, non alia loquela 
fuit; erat plena repraesentativis {2}, et inerat sensus spiritualis singulis; libri antiquorum etiam ita conscripti sunt, nam ita loqui et ita scribere erat {3}sapientiae eorum studium; quantum postea 
homo se removerit a caelo, etiam inde constare potest; nunc ne quidem novit quod in Verbo sit aliud quam quod apparet in littera, ne quidem quod sensus spiritualis inibi sit; quicquid ultra sensum 
litteralem dicitur, vocatur mysticum, quod solum ideo rejicitur; inde quoque est quod intercepta sit communicatio hodie cum caelo, in tantum ut a paucis credatur quod aliquod caelum sit, et quod mirum, 
a doctis et eruditis multo pauciores quam a simplicibus {4}. @1 i ut apud prophetas$  @2 i et significativis$  @3 sapere$  @4 i probis$  </p>
