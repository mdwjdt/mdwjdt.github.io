<h4 align="center"></h4><p><strong>539.</strong>某灵在世时以通奸为乐，根据他的请求，他被允许迈进天堂的第一道门槛。一到那里，他就开始遭受痛苦，并直觉出自己腐尸般的恶臭，直到再也无法忍受它。他仿佛觉得再往前一步就会灭亡，因此他被投入地的深处，怒不可遏地说，他在天堂的第一道门槛处感觉如此痛苦，仅仅因为他到的那个地方与通奸格格不入。该灵就是其中一个不幸者。</p>

<p><strong>[NCE]539.</strong> A certain spirit who in bodily life had considered adultery perfectly harmless was also allowed to cross heaven's first threshold, since that was what he wanted. On arriving there, he began to suffer and to smell his own corpselike stench. These sensations grew until he could no longer stand them. If he had gone any farther, it seemed to him, he would have been destroyed.<br />Consequently he was banished from there to the underground realm. He felt angry that crossing heaven's first threshold meant undergoing such tortures, since he was entering an environment opposed to adultery. He is one of the unfortunate ones. </p>

A certain spirit who during his life in the body had made light of adulteries, was in accordance with his desire admitted to the first threshold of heaven. As soon as he came there he began to suffer 
and to be sensible of his own cadaverous stench, until he could endure it no longer. It seemed to him that if he went any farther he should perish, and he was therefore cast down to the lower earth, 
enraged that he should feel such torment at the first threshold of heaven, merely because he had arrived in a sphere that was contrary to adulteries. He is among the unhappy. </p>

<p align="center"><b>Elliott(1983-1999) 539</b></p><p><b>539.</b>
There was a certain spirit who during his lifetime had thought nothing of committing adultery. Even he, because he desired it, gained admission to the threshold of heaven. On reaching it he began to 
suffer and to be aware of his own corpse-like stench until he could put up with it no longer. It seemed to him that if he went any further he would perish. Consequently he was cast down from there into 
the lower earth, furious that when on only the threshold of heaven he should experience such excruciating pains because he had entered a sphere that was the contrary of adultery. He is among those who 
are unhappy.  </p>

</p><b>539.</b>
Quidam qui in vita corporis adulteria pro nihilo reputavit, etiam, quia cupivit, admissus ad primum caeli limen; quo cum venit, incepit angi et sentire sui fetorem cadaverosum, usque dum non amplius 
sustineret; si ulterius venisset, visum ei quasi periret: quare inde dejectus in terram inferiorem, {1} iratus quod cum ad primum limen caeli, in tales cruciatus veniret, quia in sphaeram contrariam 
adulteriis; inter infelices est. @	1 inferiorum I.$ </p>
