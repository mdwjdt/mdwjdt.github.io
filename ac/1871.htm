<h3 align="center" class="ired">属天的奥秘 第1871节</h3>
<h4 align="center"></h4><p>1871．很难描述主的圣言如何显现在天使面前，不过，曾见过博物馆中的光柱之人可能会有某种概念。在这些光柱中，美丽的形像可通过事物的粗略投射呈现出来。尽管投射到周围的东西看似没有形状、序列和次序，只是胡乱投射，但当聚焦于圆柱体时，它们仍在那里制造出可爱的图像。主的圣言也是如此，尤其旧约的预言。从字面上看，几乎每个事物都显得毫无秩序，但当人，尤其小男孩或小女孩阅读它时，它就会随着它的上升而逐渐变得越来越美丽、快乐，直到最后以人的形像呈现在主面前。天堂以其整体存在于这形像中，并通过它来表现，但不是照着它的样子，而是照着主想要它成为的样子，即照着主自己的样式来表现。</p>

<p><strong>[NCE]1871.</strong> I cannot describe how the Lord's Word appears before angels, but it can be grasped to some extent by people who have seen optical cylinders in museums. These cylinders reflect beautiful images from distorted drawings projected in a circle around them. Although the surrounding drawing appears to have no shape, organization, or pattern but to be simply a confused projection, it presents a lovely picture when focused onto the cylinder.{*1} That is how the Lord's Word is, especially the prophetic part of the Old Testament. Hardly anything can be seen in the literal meaning besides a disorganized jumble; but when it is read by a person on earth (particularly a little boy or girl), it gradually rises up, turning more beautiful and more pleasing as it goes. In the end it presents itself to the Lord as a human figure representing the whole of heaven — not as heaven actually is but as the Lord wishes it to be; in other words, as his likeness.<br /><br /><strong>Footnotes:</strong><br />{*1} Although one scholar (Potts 1888-1902, under "cylinder") understands this device to be a kaleidoscope, Swedenborg seems here to be referring to a device called an anamorphoscope, which produces an optical illusion called an anamorphosis. The cylinder is polished (as indicated in similar descriptions in <a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_1871/swedenborg_new-jerusalem-and-heavenly-doctrine-whitehead_260" target=_top>New Jerusalem 260</a>; <a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_1871/swedenborg_white-horse-ryder_11#subsection-2-4" target=_top>White Horse 11:4</a>; Spiritual Experiences [Swedenborg 1998-2002] <a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_1871/swedenborg_spiritual-experiences-odhner_2164" target=_top>2164</a>) and acts as a curved mirror; it is set next to a distorted drawing that is composed in such a way that the reflection of the drawing on the surface of the cylinder appears properly proportioned. For examples of anamorphoses from Swedenborg's time and before, see Leeman and others 1976. (A reflecting cylinder may be seen in plate 53 there.) Further examples, though not of the same historical interest, can be found in McLoughlin Bros. 1979. [SS, LHC] </p>

How the Word of the Lord appears before the angels cannot be described, but some idea can be formed by those who have seen in museums the optical cylinders in which beautiful images are represented from 
things roughly projected. Although the things which are round about in the projection appear to have no form, series, or order, and to be merely confused projections, still when they are concentrated 
toward the cylinder, they there present a lovely image. So it is with the Word of the Lord, especially with the prophetic Word of the Old Testament. In the literal sense there is scarcely anything 
that does not appear destitute of order, but when it is being read by a man, and especially by a little boy or girl, it becomes more beautiful and delightful by degrees as it ascends, and at last it 
is presented before the Lord as the image of a human being, in which and by which heaven is represented in its whole complex, not as it is, but as the Lord wills it to be, namely, a likeness of Himself. </p>

The appearance that the Word of the Lord takes on as it is seen by the angels defies description; yet some idea of it may be had by those who have seen in places where curiosities are housed those optical 
cylinders in which beautiful images are produced from projected components that seemingly lie around without order.<A name="fntext1"></a><A href="#fn1"><sup>a</sup></a> But although these components which lie around one another appear to have no 
form, sequence, or order, and appear to be wholly shapeless projections, yet when they are all directed towards the cylinder they produce a lovely image there. So it is with the Word of the Lord, especially 
in the prophetical part of the Old Testament. Almost everything in the literal sense there seems to be without order, but when it is read by man, and especially by a very young boy or girl, it 
becomes by degrees more lovely and delightful as it ascends, and at length presents itself before the Lord as the image of a human being in which and by means of which heaven is represented in its entirety, 
not as it is in fact but as the Lord would like it to be, that is, a likeness of Himself.

Verbum Domini quomodo apparet coram angelis, non describi potest, sed aliqua idea capi ab illis qui in cimeliis {1} viderunt cylindros opticos, in quibus repraesentantur imagines pulchrae ab illis quae 
circum circa ruditer projecta sunt; ibi tametsi illa quae circum circa sunt, apparent nullius formae, seriei et ordinis, sed modo projectiones confusae, usque dum illa concentrantur versus cylindrum, 
repraesentant ibi imaginem venustam; ita se habet cum Verbo Domini, cumprimis prophetico Veteris Testamenti; in sensu littera: vix nisi inordinatum quoddam apparet, sed cum legitur ab homine, imprimis 
ab infante puerulo seu puella, fit per gradus ut ascendit, formosius et jucundius; et tandem sistitur coram Domino sicut imago hominis, in qua et per quam repraesentatur caelum in suo complexu, non 
quale est, sed quale vult Dominus ut sit, nempe ut sit similitudo Ipsius. 	@1 cimelium from Gk. [ ] (keimelion) = 'a depository, treasure house (? museum).' The following description seems to be that 
of a kaleidoscope.$ </p>
