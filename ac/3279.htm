<h3 align="center" class="ired">属天的奥秘 第3279节</h3>
<h4 align="center"></h4><p><strong>3279.</strong>“这些是亚伯拉罕的儿子以撒的后代”表主的神圣理性，神圣属世层就源于这神圣理性层。这从“后代”的含义清楚可知，“后代”是指衍生物（<a href="1145.htm">1145</a>，<a href="1255.htm">1255</a>，<a href="1330.htm">1330</a>节），也就是说，当论述信时，就是信的衍生物，当论述教会时，就是教会的衍生物，正如前面以实玛利的“后代”表示属灵教会的衍生物 （<a href="3263.htm">3263</a>节）。但“后代”在此论及主，故所表示的是神圣的后代，也就是说，神圣理性由神性本身所生，神圣理性由亚伯拉罕所生的以撒来表示；而神圣属世层则由神圣理性所生，神圣属世层由以撒所生的以扫和雅各来表示。因为以扫和雅各代表主的神圣属世层，以扫代表神圣属世层的良善，雅各代表神圣属世层的真理，如接下来所论述的。这些就是此处“后代”所表示的事。</p>

<p align="center"><b>Potts(1905-1910) 3279</b></p><p><b>3279.</b>
And these are the births of Isaac, the son of Abraham. That this signifies the Lord's Divine rational, from which is the Divine natural, is evident from the signification of "births" as being derivations 
(n. 1145, 1255, 1330), namely, derivations of faith when faith is treated of, and derivations of the church when the church is treated of, just as above the derivations of the spiritual church were 
signified by the "births" of Ishmael (n. 3263). But here, since the "births" are predicated of the Lord, it is Divine births that are meant, namely, that from the Divine Itself is born the Divine rational, 
which is signified by Isaac being begotten by Abraham; and that from the Divine rational is the Divine natural, which is signified by Esau and Jacob being from Isaac; for by Esau and Jacob the 
Lord's Divine natural is represented-by Esau as to good, and by Jacob as to truth-as will be shown in what now follows. This is what is here signified by the "births." </p>

<p align="center"><b>Elliott(1983-1999) 3279</b></p><p><b>3279.</b>
'These are the generations of Isaac, Abraham's son' means the Lord's Divine Rational, from which the Divine Natural sprang. This is clear from the meaning of 'generations' as derivatives, dealt with 
in <a href="1145.htm">1145</a>, <a href="1255.htm">1255</a>, <a href="1330.htm">1330</a>, that is to say, derivatives of faith when faith is the subject, and derivatives of the Church when the Church is the subject, as above where derivatives of the spiritual Church are 
meant by the generations of Ishmael, <a href="3263.htm">3263</a>. Here however since 'generations' has reference to the Lord, Divine generations are meant. That is to say, the Divine Rational came into being from the Divine 
itself, which is meant by Isaac who was begotten by Abraham; and the Divine Natural came into being from the Divine Rational, which is meant by Esau and Jacob who were begotten by Isaac. For Esau and 
Jacob represent the Lord's Divine Natural, Esau as regards good, and Jacob as regards truth, both being dealt with in what follows next. These are the things meant here by 'generations'. </p>

`Hae nativitates Jishaki filii Abrahami': quod significet Divinum Rationale Domini ex quo Divinum Naturale, constat ex significatione `nativitatum' quod sint derivationes, de qua n. 1145, 1255, 1330, 
nempe {1}derivationes fidei ubi de fide agitur, et {2}derivationes Ecclesiae ubi de Ecclesia, ut supra, {3}derivationes Ecclesiae spiritualis per nativitates Jishmaelis, n. 3263; hic autem quia `nativitates' 
praedicantur de Domino, sunt Divinae nativitates quae intelliguntur, nempe quod ex Ipso Divino natum sit Divinum Rationale, quod significatur per quod ex Abrahamo Jishakus, et quod ex Divino 
Rationali Divinum Naturale, significatur per quod ex Jishako Esau et Jacob, nam per `Esavum et Jacobum' repraesentatur Domini Divinum Naturale, per `Esavum' illud quoad bonum, et per `Jacobum' illud 
quoad verum, de quibus in nunc sequentibus agitur; haec sunt quae per `nativitates' hic significantur. @1 after agitur$  @2 after Ecclesia$  @3 nativitates Jischmaelis, derivationes Ecclesiae spiritualis 
per Jischmaelem repraesentatae.$  </p>
