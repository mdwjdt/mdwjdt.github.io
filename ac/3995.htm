<h3 align="center" class="ired">属天的奥秘 第3995节</h3>
<h4 align="center"></h4><p><strong>3995.</strong>“从母山羊中挑出有斑的、有点的”表此后，有虚假和邪恶混杂在里面的一切真理之良善都将是“雅各”的。这从“点”、“斑”和“山羊”的含义清楚可知：“点”是指虚假；“斑”是指邪恶，如前所示（<a href="3993.htm">3993</a>节）；“母山羊”是指真理的良善，或信之仁（<a href="3519.htm">3519</a>节）。这一切都将是“雅各”的，这一事实也由接下来的这句话，即“这些就算我的工价”来表示。<br />现简要讨论何谓真理的良善，或信之仁。当人正在重生时，表面上看，似乎信之真理占据优先地位，仁之良善是次要的；不过，一旦他重生了，那么很明显，仁之良善占据优先地位，信之真理则是次要的。前者是表象，后者是真相（参看<a href="3539.htm">3539</a>，<a href="3548.htm">3548</a>，<a href="3556.htm">3556</a>，<a href="3563.htm">3563</a>，<a href="3570.htm">3570</a>，<a href="3576.htm">3576</a>，<a href="3603.htm">3603</a>，<a href="3616.htm">3616</a>，<a href="3701.htm">3701</a>节）。因为当人正在重生时，他通过自己所学到的真理行善，因为他通过真理学习何为良善。然而，行善的其实是在里面的良善，因为良善正从主通过内在途径，也就是通过灵魂的途径流入；而真理则通过外在途径，或通过感官，就是属于身体的感官途径流入。通过外在途径进入的真理被在里面并与之结合的良善所接纳，这种活动甚至一直持续到此人已经重生。然后就发生反转，真理通过良善进行。由此明显可知何为真理的良善，何为良善的真理。这也解释了为何如今这么多人声称仁之良善是信之果实；因为在重生之初，表面看上去的确是这样。这些人便从表象得出这个结论，别的什么都不知道，因为正在重生的人很少，并且除了已重生，也就是处于对良善的情感，或处于仁爱的人外，没有人能知道这一点。他能通过对良善的情感或仁爱清楚看出并觉察到这一点；然而，那些未重生的人甚至不知道何为对良善的情感，或仁爱；反而推理它，如同推理某种对他们来说很陌生或与他们无关的事物。因此，他们称仁为信之果实，而事实上，信是仁的产物。然而，对简单人来说，知道谁在先，谁在后并不那么重要，只要他们过着仁爱的生活即可；因为仁是信的生命。<br />此处“羊群中的羊”（member of the flock）不仅是指羔羊，还指绵羊、小山羊、母山羊、公绵羊和公山羊，尽管经上只提及羔羊和母山羊。经上唯独提及这些，是因为“羔羊”表示纯真，“母山羊”表示信之仁，这些是此处在内义上所论述的主题。这也是为何在原文，“点”是用一个也表示“羔羊”的词来表述（如以赛亚书<a href="http://39-27.cn/赛40.10.htm">40:10</a>，<a href="http://39-27.cn/赛40.11.htm">11</a>）；而“斑”是用一个也表示“牧人”的词来表述（如列王记下<a href="http://39-27.cn/王下3.4.htm">3:4</a>；阿摩司书<a href="http://39-27.cn/摩1.1.htm">1:1</a>）。</p>

And the spotted and speckled among the goats.* That this signifies that then all the good of truth in which falsity and evil are mingled shall be His, is evident from the signification of "spotted," 
as being falsity; and from the signification of "speckled," as being evil; as shown above (n. 3993); and from the signification of "she-goats," as being the good of truth, or the charity of faith (n. 
3519). That all this will be His, is also signified by what follows, "and it shall be my reward."  [2] A few words as to what the good of truth is, or the charity of faith. When a man is being regenerated 
the truth which is of faith apparently comes first, and the good which is of charity apparently follows; but when the man has been regenerated, then the good which is of charity manifestly takes 
the precedence, and the truth which is of faith manifestly follows. (That the former is the appearance, and the latter the real truth, may be seen above, n. 3539, 3548, 3556, 3563, 3570, 3576, 3603, 
3616, 3701.) For when a man is being regenerated, he does what is good from the truth he has learned, because from truth he learns what is good; nevertheless it is the good within that effects this. For 
good flows in from the Lord by an internal way, that is, by the way of the soul; but truth flows in by an external way, or by the way of the senses, which is that of the body. The truth that enters 
by the latter way is adopted by the good that is within, and is conjoined with it, and this even until the man has been regenerated. A revolution then takes place, and truth is done from good. From this 
it is evident what the good of truth is, and what the truth of good. This is the reason why so many now say that the goods of charity are the fruits of faith; for so it appears in the beginning of 
regeneration, and from the appearance they draw this conclusion. Nor do they know otherwise, because there are few who are being regenerated, and no one can know this except the man who has been regenerated, 
that is, who is in the affection of good, or in charity. From the affection of good, or from charity, this can be clearly seen, and also perceived; but they who have not been regenerated do not 
even know what the affection of good, or charity, is; but reason about it as about something that is foreign to them, or outside of them; for which reason they call charity the fruit of faith, when 
yet faith is from charity. However, it is not very important for the simple to know which is prior and which posterior, provided they live in charity; for charity is the life of faith. [3] By "cattle" 
here are meant not only lambs, but also sheep, kids, she-goats, rams, and he-goats, although only lambs and she-goats are mentioned; and this because by "lambs" is signified innocence; and by "she-goats," 
the charity of faith; for these are the things here treated of in the internal sense. For this reason "spotted" is expressed in the original language by a word that also means "lambs" (as in Isa. 
40:10, 11); and "speckled" by a word that also means a "herdman" (as in 2 Kings 3:4; Amos 1:1). * Strictly, she-goats; but the common word for the flock of goats. [Rotch ed.] </p>

<p align="center"><b>Elliott(1983-1999) 3995</b></p><p><b>3995.</b>
'And the spotted and speckled among the she-goats' means that after this all the good of truth that has falsity and evil mingled within it will be 'Jacob's'. This is clear from the meaning of 'spotted' 
as falsity, and from the meaning of 'speckled' as evil, dealt with just above in <a href="3993.htm">3993</a>, and from the meaning of 'she- goats' as the good of truth, or the charity of faith, dealt with in <a href="3519.htm">3519</a>. The fact 
that all of this will be 'Jacob's' is also meant by the statement which follows, 'And that will be my wages'. </p>
<p></p>
<p><b>[2]</b>
 What is meant by the good of truth, or the charity of faith, will be discussed briefly. 
While a person is being regenerated it seems as though the truth of faith takes precedence and as though the good of charity is secondary; but once he has been regenerated it is quite plain that 
the good of charity takes precedence, and that the truth of faith is secondary. For what is seen before regeneration is the appearance but what is seen after it is the reality of the situation, see <a href="3539.htm">3539</a>, <a href="3548.htm">3548</a>, <a href="3556.htm">3556</a>, <a href="3563.htm">3563</a>, <a href="3570.htm">3570</a>, <a href="3576.htm">3576</a>, <a href="3603.htm">3603</a>, <a href="3616.htm">3616</a>, <a href="3701.htm">3701</a>. For while a person is being regenerated he does what is good from the truth he has learned, it being from truth that he learns what good is. Yet 
it is the good present inwardly that performs what is good because good is flowing in from the Lord by an internal route, that is, by way of the soul, while truth flows in by an external route, that is, 
by way of the senses, which is that of the body. Truth which enters by the external route is adopted by the good present inwardly and is joined to it, an activity which continues until that person 
has been regenerated. Then a reversal takes place and truth is done from good. This shows what is meant by the good of truth and by the truth of good. It also explains why so many at the present day speak 
of the good deeds of charity as the fruits of faith, for these are what those deeds are seen to be when regeneration first begins. These people base such a conclusion on the appearance and know nothing 
else, for those who are being regenerated are few and none can have a knowledge of this matter except one who has been regenerated, that is, who has an affection for good, which is charity. It 
is from an affection for good, or charity, that it can be seen clearly, and also perceived, by him. People however who are not regenerate do not even know what the affection for good is, that is, what 
charity is, but reason about it as something foreign or extraneous to themselves. As a consequence they call charity the fruit of faith, when in fact faith is a product of charity. However, it does not 
matter very much whether simple people know which is prior and which is posterior, provided they are leading charitable lives, for charity is the life of faith. </p>

 By the expression 'member of 
the flock' here is meant not only lambs but also sheep, kids, she-goats, rams, and he-goats, though only lambs and she- goats are actually mentioned. These alone are mentioned because 'lambs' means innocence, 
and 'she-goats' the charity of faith, these being the subject at this point in the internal sense. This too is why in the original language 'spotted' is expressed by a word which also means lambs, 
as in <a href="http://bible.gospelcom.net/cgi-bin/bible?passage=Isaiah%2040:10,11&amp;version=ESV&amp;interface=print&amp;showfn=yes&amp;showxref">Isaiah 40:10,11</a>, while 'speckled' is expressed by a word which also means a sheep breeder, as in <a href="2.htm">2</a> Kings 3:4; Amos 1:1. </p>

`Et maculosum et punctatum in capris': quod significet quod dein suum erit omne bonum veri in quo mixtum falsum et malum, constat ex significatione `maculosi' quod sit falsum, et a significatione 
`punctati' quod sit malum, de quibus mox supra n. 3993; et a significatione `caprarum' quod sit bonum veri, seu charitas fidei, de qua n. 3519; quod omne id suum erit, significatur etiam per id quod 
sequitur `Et erit merces mea.'  [2] Quid bonum veri, seu charitas fidei, paucis dicendum: cum regeneratur homo, tunc apparenter praecedit verum quod fidei, et apparenter sequitur bonum quod charitatis; 
at cum `homo regeneratus est', tunc manifeste praecedit bonum quod charitatis, et manifeste sequitur verum quod fidei; sed quod prius sit apparentia, hoc autem essentialiter ita, videatur n. 
3539, 3548, 3556, 3563, 3570, 3576, 3603, 3616, 3701; cum enim homo regeneratur, facit ille bonum ex vero quod didicit, nam ex vero discit quid bonum, sed usque est intus bonum quod hoc operatur; 
influit enim bonum a Domino per viam internam seu per viam animae, et influit verum per viam externam, seu per viam sensualem quae corporis; verum quod per hanc viam intrat, adoptatur a bono quod 
intus, et ei conjungitur, et hoc eousque dum homo regeneratus est; tunc versura fit, et a bono agitur verum; inde patet quid bonum veri, et quid boni verum; inde est quod tam multi hodie dicant quod 
{1}bona charitatis sint fructus fidei, apparet enim ita in principio regenerationis; ex apparentia id concludunt, nec sciunt aliter, quia pauci sunt qui regenerantur, et nemo id scire potest quam 
qui regeneratus est, hoc est, qui in affectione boni est seu in charitate; ex affectione boni seu charitate hoc videri potest clare, et quoque percipi; qui autem non regenerati sunt, ne quidem sciunt 
quid affectio boni seu quid charitas, sed ratiocinantur de illa sicut de re aliena, seu de re extra illos; quapropter charitatem vocant fructum fidei, cum tamen fides est ex charitate; sed usque 
non tanti interest ut simplices sciant quid prius et quid posterius, modo in charitate vivant, nam charitas est vita fidei.  [3] Per pecus hic significantur tam agni, quam oves, haedi, caprae, arietes, 
hirci, sed nominantur solum agni et caprae, et hoc est causa quia per `agnos' significatur innocentia, et per `capras' charitas fidei, de his enim in sensu interno hic agitur; inde quoque est 
quod maculosum in lingua originali exprimatur per {2}vocem quae quoque significat agnos, ut apud Esaiam xl 10 [11]; et punctatum per {3}vocem, quae quoque significat pecuarium, ut 2 Reg. iii 4; Amos i
