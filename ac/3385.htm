<h3 align="center" class="ired">属天的奥秘 第3385节</h3>
<h4 align="center"></h4><p><strong>3385.</strong>“那地方的人问到他的妻子”表人们询问关于神圣真理的问题。这从“问”、“那地方的人”和“妻子”的含义清楚可知：“问”是指询问；“那地方（就是基拉耳）的人”是指那些拥有信之教义事物的人，“基拉耳”表信的事物（参看<a href="1209.htm">1209</a>，<a href="2504.htm">2504</a>节），因此“那地方的人”是指具有这种状态的人；“妻子”，就是此处的利百加，是指主的神圣理性的神圣真理（<a href="3012.htm">3012</a>，<a href="3013.htm">3013</a>，<a href="3077.htm">3077</a>节）。前几节论述的主题是真理的表象，它们是从主进入人理性事物的神性流注的产物。此处论述的主题是对这些表象的接受；其实首先接受这些表象的，是那些拥有信之教义事物的人，就是“那地方（即基拉耳）的人”所表示的人，他们属于第一类被称为属灵的人。事实上，由于属灵之人不像属天之人那样拥有直觉，并且与属天之人相比处于模糊的状态（<a href="1043.htm">1043</a>，<a href="2088.htm">2088</a>，<a href="2669.htm">2669</a>，<a href="2708.htm">2708</a>，<a href="2715.htm">2715</a>，<a href="2718.htm">2718</a>，<a href="2831.htm">2831</a>，<a href="3235.htm">3235</a>，<a href="3241.htm">3241</a>，<a href="3246.htm">3246</a>节），故他们总是询问事情是否如此，以及它是不是神圣真理。由于他们没有直觉来查看事情是否如此，于是他们被赋予某种事物，就是真理的表象；这种事物在他们的理性思维，也就是领悟的范畴内，这样他们就能接受。每个人都被允许照自己的理解而相信真理。要不然，他们就因不承认而不接受。这就是此处所论述的主题。</p>

And the men of the place asked him concerning his woman. That this signifies the investigations of men concerning Divine truth, is evident from the signification of "asking," as being to investigate; 
and from the signification of the "men of the place," namely, Gerar, as being those who are in the doctrinal things of faith (that "Gerar" signifies the things of faith may be seen above, n. 1209, 2504; 
thus the "men of the place" are men of such a state); and from the signification of "woman," who here is Rebekah, as being the Divine truth of the Lord's Divine rational (n. 3012, 3013, 3077). In 
what precedes, the appearances of truth have been treated of, in that they come forth by means of Divine influx from the Lord into man's rational things; and the subject here treated of is the reception 
of these appearances; first by those who are in the doctrinal things of faith, and who are meant by the "men of the place," or of Gerar, and are of the first class of those who are called the spiritual; 
for as the spiritual have not perception, like the celestial, and are comparatively in obscurity (n. 1043, 2088, 2669, 2708, 2715, 2718, 2831, 3235, 3241, 3246), they investigate whether a thing 
be so, and also whether it is Divine truth; and as they have no perception as to whether it is so, there is given them what appears like truth, and this according to their rational, that is, according 
to their apprehension, for in this way it is received. Each person is permitted to believe truths as he apprehends them; otherwise there would be no reception, because no acknowledgment. This is the 
subject now treated of. </p>

'And the men of the place asked about his wife' means questions that people ask about Divine Truth. This is clear from the meaning of 'asking about' as the asking of questions; from the meaning of 'the 
men of the place (that is to say, of Gerar)' as people who possess matters of doctrine concerning faith - 'Gerar' meaning matters of faith, see <a href="1209.htm">1209</a>, <a href="2504.htm">2504</a>, and so 'the men of the place' people whose 
state is such; and from the meaning of 'wife', who is Rebekah here, as the Divine Truth of the Lord's Divine Rational, dealt with in <a href="3012.htm">3012</a>, <a href="3013.htm">3013</a>, <a href="3077.htm">3077</a>. The subject in previous verses has been the consideration 
that appearances of truth are the product of Divine influx from the Lord into a person's rational concepts. Now the subject is the reception of those appearances, and indeed first by people 
who possess matters of doctrine concerning faith, and who are meant by 'the men of the place (which is Gerar)' who belong to the first class of those called spiritual. In fact because these do not have 
perception, as those who are celestial do, and in comparison with whom they are in obscurity, <a href="1043.htm">1043</a>, <a href="2088.htm">2088</a>, <a href="2669.htm">2669</a>, <a href="2708.htm">2708</a>, <a href="2715.htm">2715</a>, <a href="2718.htm">2718</a>, <a href="2831.htm">2831</a>, <a href="3235.htm">3235</a>, <a href="3241.htm">3241</a>, <a href="3246.htm">3246</a>, they always question whether a thing is so, 
and also whether it is Divine Truth. And because they do not have perception by which they see whether it is so, they are given something which is an appearance of the truth, such as falls within the 
range of their rational thought, that is, within their mental grasp and so can be received by them. Everyone is allowed to believe truths in the measure that he understands them. If this were not so 
there would be no reception of them because there would be no acknowledgement. These are the matters which are the subject now. </p>

`Et interrogaverunt viri loci ad mulierem ejus': quod significet disquisitiones hominum de Divino Vero, constat ex significatione `interrogare' quod sit disquirere; a significatione `virorum loci' nempe 
Geraris quod sint illi qui in doctrinalibus fidei; quod `Gerar' sint illa quae fidei, videatur n. 1209, 2504, ita `viri loci' sunt homines talis status; et ex significatione `mulieris,' hic Rebeccae, 
quod sit Divinum Verum Divini Rationalis Domini, de qua n. 3012, 3013, 3077. In illis quae praecedunt, actum est de apparentiis veri quod existant per influxum Divinum a Domino in rationalia hominis; 
hic nunc agitur de receptione illarum, et quidem primo ab illis qui in doctrinalibus fidei sunt, et {1}intelliguntur per `viros loci' seu Geraris ac sunt ex prima classe illorum qui spirituales vocantur; 
hi enim quia non perceptionem habent, sicut caelestes, et in obscuro sunt respective, n. 1043, 2088, 2669, 2708 pr., 2715, 2718, 2831, 3235, 3241, 3246 disquirunt num ita sit, {2}tum num Divinum 
Verum sit; et quia non perceptionem habent {3}num sit, datur illis tale quod apparet sicut verum, et hoc secundum, rationale eorum, hoc est, secundum captum sic enim recipitur; cuique permittitur 
credere veris sicut illa capit si non id, non foret receptio, quia non aliqua agnitio: de his nunc agitur. @1 significantur$  @2 seu$  @3 ac ideo non capiunt an Divinum sit$  </p>
