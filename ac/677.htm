<h4 align="center"></h4><p>677．至于将要重生之人的食物，情况乃是这样：在一个人能被重生之前，他必须具备可充当工具的所有事物，情感的良善和快乐充当意愿的工具，来自主圣言的真理和通过其它源头确证的事物充当觉知的工具。在一个人尚未具备这类事物之前，他无法得以重生。这些就是他的食物。这解释了为何人在未成年之前不会重生的原因。不过，每个人都有自己特有的、可以说为他量身制作的食物，主在重生人之前会将这食物提供给他。</p>

<p><strong>[NCE]677.</strong> To describe the food of people who are to be reborn: Before we can be reborn, we have to be equipped with everything instrumental to rebirth. Good, joyful feelings serve the needs of our will, while truth from the Lord's Word, along with support and confirmation from other sources, serves our intellectual needs. Till we receive this preparation, we cannot be regenerated. Those supplies are our food. That is why we cannot be regenerated before we reach adulthood. But we each have foods particularly appropriate to us that seem to be all our own, and the Lord provides us with them prior to our rebirth. </p>
<p align="center"><b>Potts(1905-1910) 677</b></p><p><b>677.</b>
As regards the food of the man who is to be regenerated, the case is this: Before a man can be regenerated he needs to be furnished with all things that may serve as means-with the goods and delights 
of the affections as means for the will; and with truths from the Word of the Lord, and also with confirmatory things from other sources, as means for the understanding. Until a man is furnished with 
such things he cannot be regenerated; these being for food. This is the reason why man is not regenerated until he comes to adult age. But each man has his peculiar and as it were his own food, which 
is provided for him by the Lord before he is regenerated. </p>

<p align="center"><b>Elliott(1983-1999) 677</b></p><p><b>677.</b>
As regards the food of someone who is to be regenerated, the situation is this: Before anyone can be regenerated he must be supplied with all those things that can serve as means - the goods and delights 
which constitute affections as means for the will, and truths from the Lord's Word, together also with matters of a confirmatory nature from other sources, as means for the understanding. Until a 
person has been supplied with these he cannot be regenerated. These are what constitute his food. This explains why a person is not regenerated until he has entered adult years. Everybody however has 
some particular food so to speak proper to himself, which the Lord provides for him before regeneration takes place. </p>

<p align="center"><b>Latin(1748-1756) 677</b>
</p><b>677.</b>
Quod cibum hominis regenerandi concernit, ita se res habet: antequam regenerari potest homo, instructus debet esse omnibus illis quae pro mediis inservire possunt, bonis et jucundis affectionum pro 
voluntariis, veris ex Verbo Domini, et confirmantibus quoque aliunde pro intellectualibus; antequam homo talibus instructus est, non regenerari potest; sunt illa cibi; quae causa est quod homo, non nisi 
quam cum ad adultam aetatem venit, regeneretur: sed unicuique homini peculiares, et quasi proprii, cibi sunt, qui a Domino providentur ei antequam regeneratur. </p>
