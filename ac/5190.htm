<p>Genesis 41 </p>
<p>	1. And it came to pass 
from the end of two years of days and Pharaoh dreamed, and behold he stood by the river. 	2. And behold out of the river there came up seven kine, beautiful in look and fat in flesh; and they fed in 
the sedge. 	3. And behold seven other kine came up after them out of the river, evil in look and thin in flesh; and stood by the kine upon the bank of the river. 	4. And the kine evil in look and thin 
in flesh did eat up the seven kine beautiful in look and fat. And Pharaoh awoke. 	5. And he slept and dreamed a second time, and behold seven ears of corn came up upon one stalk, fat and good. 	6. 
And behold seven ears thin and parched with the east wind sprung up after them. 	7. And the thin ears swallowed up the seven fat and full ears. And Pharaoh awoke, and behold it was a dream. 	8. And 
it came to pass in the morning that his spirit was troubled; and he sent and called all the magicians of Egypt, and all the wise men thereof; and Pharaoh told them his dream; and no one interpreted 
these things to Pharaoh. 	9. And spoke the prince of the butlers unto Pharaoh, saying, I do remember my sins this day. 	10. Pharaoh was wroth upon his servants, and put me in custody in the house of 
the prince of the guards, me and the prince of the bakers: </p>
<p>	11. And we dreamed a dream in one night, I and he; we dreamed each one according to the interpretation of his dream. 	12. And there was with 
us there a Hebrew boy, servant to the prince of the guards; and we told him, and he interpreted to us our dreams; to each according to his dream he did interpret. 	13. And it came to pass, as he 
interpreted to us, so it was; me he brought back upon my station, and him he hanged. 	14. And Pharaoh sent and called Joseph, and they brought him hastily out of the pit; and he shaved, and changed his 
garments, and came unto Pharaoh. 	15. And Pharaoh said unto Joseph, I have dreamed a dream, and no one interpreteth it; and I have heard upon thee, saying, thou hearest a dream to interpret it. 	16. 
And Joseph answered Pharaoh, saying, Not unto me; God shall answer peace to Pharaoh. 	17. And Pharaoh spoke unto Joseph, In my dream behold I stood beside the bank of the river: </p>
<p>	18. And behold 
out of the river there came up seven kine, fat in flesh and beautiful in form, and they fed in the sedge: </p>
<p>	19. And behold seven other kine came up after them, thin and evil in form exceedingly, and lean 
in flesh, such as I have never seen in all the land of Egypt for badness: </p>
<p>	20. And the lean and evil kine did eat up the first seven fat kine; </p>
<p>	21. And they came to their inwards and it was not 
known that they had come to their inwards; and their look was bad as in the beginning. And I awoke. 	22. And I saw in my dream, and behold seven ears came up upon one stalk, full and good; </p>
<p>	23. And 
behold seven ears, withered, thin, and parched with the east wind, sprung up after them; </p>
<p>	24. And the thin ears swallowed up the seven good ears; and I told it unto the magicians; and no one telleth 
it to me. 	25. And Joseph said unto Pharaoh, The dream of Pharaoh is one; what God is about to do He hath shown to Pharaoh. 	26. The seven good kine are seven years, and the seven good ears are seven 
years: the dream is one. 	27. And the seven thin and evil kine that came up after them are seven years, and the seven empty ears parched with the east wind shall be seven years of famine. 	28. This 
is the word that I spoke unto Pharaoh; what God doeth He hath caused Pharaoh to see. 	29. Behold there come seven years of great abundance of produce in all the land of Egypt; </p>
<p>	30. And there shall 
arise after them seven years of famine; and all the abundance of produce shall be forgotten in the land of Egypt; and the famine shall consume the land; </p>
<p>	31. And the abundance of produce shall not be 
known in the land by reason of that famine after it, for it shall be very grievous. 	32. And for that the dream was doubled unto Pharaoh twice, it is because the word is established by God, and God 
is hastening to do it. 	33. And now let Pharaoh see a man intelligent and wise, and set him over the land of Egypt. 	34. Let Pharaoh do this, and let him appoint governors over the land, and take the 
fifth of the land of Egypt in the seven years of abundance of produce. 	35. And let them gather all the food of those good years that come, and heap up corn under the hand of Pharaoh for food in the 
cities, and let them guard it. 	36. And the food shall be for a store to the land against the seven years of famine that shall be in the land of Egypt; and the land shall not be cut off in the famine. 	37. 
And the word was good in the eyes of Pharaoh, and in the eyes of all his servants. 	38. And Pharaoh said unto his servants, Shall we find such a one as this, a man in whom is the spirit of 
God? 	39. And Pharaoh said unto Joseph, Forasmuch as God has caused thee to know all this, there is no one so intelligent and wise as thou. 	40. Thou shalt be over my house, and upon thy mouth shall 
all my people kiss; only in the throne will I be greater than thou. 	41. And Pharaoh said unto Joseph, See, I have set thee over all the land of Egypt. 	42. And Pharaoh took off his ring from upon 
his hand, and put it upon Joseph's hand, and clothed him in garments of fine linen, and put a necklace of gold upon his neck; </p>
<p>	43. And he made him ride in the second chariot that he had; and they cried 
before him, Abrech; and he set him over all the land of Egypt. 	44. And Pharaoh said unto Joseph, I am Pharaoh, and without thee shall no man lift up his hand or his foot in all the land of Egypt. 	45. 
And Pharaoh called Joseph's name Zaphenath-paneah; and he gave him Asenath the daughter of Potiphera priest of On for a woman; and Joseph went out over the land of Egypt. 	46. And Joseph was 
a son of thirty years when he stood before Pharaoh king of Egypt. And Joseph went out from before Pharaoh, and passed over into all the land of Egypt. 	47. And the earth made gatherings in the seven 
years of abundance of produce. 	48. And he gathered together all the food of the seven years that were in the land of Egypt, and put the food in the cities; the food of the field of the city, that which 
was round about it, put he in the midst thereof. 	49. And Joseph heaped up corn as the sand of the sea, exceeding much, until he ceased to number, because it was without number. 	50. And to Joseph 
were born two sons before the year of famine came, whom Asenath the daughter of Potiphera priest of On bare to him. 	51. And Joseph called the name of the firstborn Manasseh; For God hath made me 
forget all my toil, and all my father's house. 	52. And the name of the second called he Ephraim; For God hath made me fruitful in the land of my affliction. 	53. And the seven years of abundance of 
produce that was in the land of Egypt, were ended. 	54. And the seven years of famine began to come, as Joseph had said; and there was famine in all the lands; and in all the land of Egypt there was 
bread. 	55. And all the land of Egypt was famished, and the people cried unto Pharaoh for bread; and Pharaoh said to all Egypt, Go unto Joseph; what he saith to you, do. 	56. And the famine was over 
all the faces of the land; and Joseph opened all the storehouses, and sold to Egypt; and the famine was strengthened in the land of Egypt. 	57. And all the earth came into Egypt to buy, to Joseph; 
because the famine was strengthened in all the earth. </p>

<p><LI value='1'> And it happened at the end of two years of days,<A name="fntext2"></a><A href="#fn2"><sup>b</sup></a> that Pharaoh was dreaming, and behold, he was standing 
next to the river.  <LI value='2'> And behold, out of the river seven cows were coming up, beautiful in appearance and fat-fleshed; and they fed in the sedge. <LI value='3'> And behold, seven other cows were coming up 
after them out of the river, bad in appearance and thin-fleshed, and stood by the [other] cows on the bank of the river. <LI value='4'> And the cows bad in appearance and thin-fleshed devoured the seven cows beautiful 
in appearance and fat. And Pharaoh awoke. <LI value='5'> And he fell asleep and dreamed a second time, and behold, seven heads of grain were coming up on one stalk, fat and good. <LI value='6'> And behold, seven heads, 
thin and scorched by an east wind, were sprouting after them. <LI value='7'> And the thin heads swallowed up the seven fat and full heads. And Pharaoh awoke, and behold, it was a dream. <LI value='8'> And it happened early 
in the morning, that his spirit was troubled, and he sent and called all the magi of Egypt, and all its wise men; and Pharaoh told them his dream, and there was no one to interpret them for Pharaoh. <LI value='9'> 
And the chief of the cupbearers spoke to Pharaoh, saying, I remember my sins today. <LI value='10'> Pharaoh was incensed with his servants, and put me into custody in the house of the chief of the attendants, me 
and the chief of the bakers. <LI value='11'> And we dreamed a dream in one night, I and he; we dreamed each according to the interpretation of his own dream. <LI value='12'> And a Hebrew boy was there with us, a servant to 
the chief of the attendants; and we told him, and he interpreted our dreams for us, to each according to his dream he gave the interpretation. <LI value='13'> And it happened, that as he interpreted to us, so it 
came about. He restored me to my position, and he hanged him. <LI value='14'> And Pharaoh sent and called Joseph, and they hurried him out of the pit; and he clipped [his hair and beard], and changed his clothes, 
and came to Pharaoh. <LI value='15'> And Pharaoh said to Joseph, I have dreamed a dream, and there is no one who can interpret it; and I have heard about you - it is said that when you hear a dream you can interpret 
it. <LI value='16'> And Joseph answered Pharaoh, saying, It is not mine; God will give an answer of peace, O Pharaoh. <LI value='17'> And Pharaoh spoke to Joseph, In my dream, behold, I was standing on the bank of the 
river. <LI value='18'> And behold, out of the river seven cows were coming up, fat-fleshed and beautiful in form; and they fed in the sedge. <LI value='19'> And behold, seven other cows were coming up after them, weak and extremely 
bad in form and lean-fleshed; I have not seen any like them in all the land of Egypt for badness. <LI value='20'> And the lean and bad cows devoured the first seven fat cows. <LI value='21'> And they devoured them completely<A name="fntext3"></a><A href="#fn3"><sup>c</sup></a> 
and no one would have known that they had devoured them completely;<A name="fntext4"></a><A href="#fn4"><sup>d</sup></a> and their appearance was malign, as it had been in the beginning. And I awoke. <LI value='22'> And I saw in my dream, and behold, 
seven heads of grain were coming up on one stalk, full and good. <LI value='23'> And behold, seven heads, dried up, thin, and scorched by an east wind, were sprouting after them. <LI value='24'> And the thin heads swallowed 
up the seven good heads. And I told it to the magi, and there was no one to point out the meaning to me. <LI value='25'> And Joseph said to Pharaoh, Pharaoh's dream, it is one; what God is doing He has pointed 
out to Pharaoh. <LI value='26'> The seven good cows are seven years, and the seven good heads of grain are seven years; the dream, it is one. <LI value='27'> And the seven thin and bad cows coming up after them are seven years; 
and the seven empty heads of grain, scorched by an east wind, will be seven years of famine. <LI value='28'> This is the word which I have spoken to Pharaoh; what God is doing He has caused Pharaoh to see. <LI value='29'> 
Behold, seven years are coming, [in which there will be] a great abundance of corn in all the land of Egypt. <LI value='30'> And seven years of famine will arise after them, and all the abundance of corn in the 
land of Egypt will be thrust into oblivion, and the famine will consume the land. <LI value='31'> And the abundance of corn in the land will not be known because of the famine from then on, for it will be extremely 
severe. <LI value='32'> And as for the dream being presented<A name="fntext5"></a><A href="#fn5"><sup>e</sup></a> to Pharaoh twice, this is because the thing is established by God, and God is hastening to do it. <LI value='33'> And now let Pharaoh see<A name="fntext6"></a><A href="#fn6"><sup>f</sup></a> a man with 
intelligence and wisdom, and set him over the land of Egypt. <LI value='34'> Let Pharaoh do this, and let him place governors in charge over the land, and let him take up the fifth part of the land of Egypt in the 
seven years of abundance of corn. <LI value='35'> And let them gather all the food of these good years that are coming, and let them store up grain under the hand of Pharaoh - food in the cities; and let them 
guard it. <LI value='36'> And let the food be for a reserve for the land, for the seven years of famine which there will be in the land of Egypt, and the land will not be cut off in the famine. <LI value='37'> And the thing 
was good in Pharaoh's eyes and in the eyes of all his servants. <LI value='38'> And Pharaoh said to his servants, Shall we find a man like this, in whom is the spirit of God? <LI value='39'> And Pharaoh said to Joseph, After 
God has caused you to know all this, no one has wisdom and intelligence like you. <LI value='40'> You shall be over my house, and all my people shall kiss on your mouth; only in the throne will I be great, more 
than you. <LI value='41'> And Pharaoh said to Joseph, See, I have set you over all the land of Egypt. <LI value='42'> And Pharaoh took off his ring from upon his hand and put it onto Joseph's hand, and clothed him in robes of 
fine linen, and placed a chain of gold onto his neck. <LI value='43'> And he made him ride in the second chariot that he had; and they cried out before him, Abrek! and he set him over all the land of Egypt.  <LI value='44'> 
And Pharaoh said to Joseph, I am Pharaoh, and without you no man shall lift up his hand or his foot in all the land of Egypt. <LI value='45'> And Pharaoh called Joseph's name Zaphenath Paneah, and gave him Asenath, 
the daughter of Potiphera the priest of On, for a wife; and Joseph went out over the land of Egypt. <LI value='46'> And Joseph was a son of thirty years when he stood before Pharaoh king of Egypt; and Joseph 
came out from before Pharaoh, and went through all the land of Egypt. <LI value='47'> And in the seven years of abundance of corn the land yielded bunches. <LI value='48'> And he gathered all the food of the seven years which 
were in the land of Egypt, and laid up<A name="fntext7"></a><A href="#fn7"><sup>g</sup></a> the food in the cities; the food of the field of a city which was round about it he laid up<A name="fntext7"></a><A href="#fn7"><sup>g</sup></a> in the midst of it. <LI value='49'> And Joseph stored up grain like 
the sand of the sea, very much, until he left off numbering, because it was beyond number. <LI value='50'> And to Joseph were born two sons before the year of famine came, whom Asenath, the daughter of Potiphera 
the priest of On, bore to him. <LI value='51'> And Joseph called the name of the firstborn Manasseh - for God has made me forget all my labour and all my father's house. <LI value='52'> And the name of the second he called 
Ephraim - for God has made me fruitful in the land of my affliction. <LI value='53'> And the seven years of abundance of corn ended, which was in the land of Egypt. <LI value='54'> And the seven years of famine began to come, 
even as Joseph had said; and the famine was in all lands, and in all the land of Egypt there was bread. <LI value='55'> And all the land of Egypt suffered famine, and the people cried out to Pharaoh for bread. 
And Pharaoh said to all Egypt, Go to Joseph; do what he tells you. <LI value='56'> And the famine was over all the face of the earth; and Joseph opened all the places in which [there was grain] and sold to Egypt. 
And the famine was becoming great in the land of Egypt. 57 And all the earth came to Egypt to buy [grain], to Joseph; for the famine became great in all the earth.
