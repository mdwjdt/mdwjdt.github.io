<h3 align="center" class="ired">属天的奥秘 第2135节</h3>
<h4 align="center"></h4><p><h4 align="center">序言</h4><br />2135.前一章末尾论述了最后的审判，并说明了它的含义，也就是说，最后审判并非指这个世界的毁灭，而是指教会的末世。当这一切即将来临时，主说，祂要“驾着天上的云降临，有能力，有大荣耀”（马太福音<a href="http://39-27.cn/太24.30.htm">24:30</a>；马可福音<a href="http://39-27.cn/可13.26.htm">13:26</a>；路加福音<a href="http://39-27.cn/路21.27.htm">21:27</a>）。至今没人知道“天上的云”是什么意思。不过，它的含义已向我揭示，即它无非是指圣言的字义；“能力和荣耀”则指圣言的内义，因为圣言内义本身有荣耀，凡在内义中的事物都涉及主和祂的国度（参看第一卷，<a href="1769.htm">1769</a>-<a href="1772.htm">1772</a>节）。当主在荣耀中显现给彼得、雅各、约翰时，遮盖他们的云彩也具有相同的含义。对此，路加福音上说：<br />有声音从云彩里出来，说，这是我的爱子，你们要听祂。声音住了，只见耶稣独在。（路加福音<a href="http://39-27.cn/路9.35.htm">9:35</a>，<a href="http://39-27.cn/路9.36.htm">36</a>）<br />在那里与主说话的“摩西和以利亚”代表旧约，也就是所谓的“摩西和众先知”。“摩西”代表他的书和其它历史书，“先知以利亚”代表所有先知书。但福音书中所提及的“彼得、雅各和约翰”均代表信、仁和仁之善。唯独他们在场则表示其他人不像那些具有信及其仁，以及仁之善的人那样能看到主的荣耀，主的荣耀就在祂的圣言中。其他人有能力看到，却看不到，因为他们不信。这就是上述两句经文的内义。在先知书的各个地方，“云”均表圣言的文字，“荣耀”表圣言的生命。前面已多次阐述并逐句解释说明何为圣言的内义及其性质。在主的时代，最不相信圣言中有关主的内容的，就是那些精通律法的人。如今，这类专家固然知道，但恐怕他们最不相信除了字面上的荣耀外，圣言还有何荣耀可言。尽管事实上，文字是包含荣耀的云。<br />第18章<br />通过本章我们会以特别的方式明白圣言内义的性质，以及世人在阅读圣言时天使理解它的方式。我们通过字面上的历史意义所了解到的，无非是耶和华化为三个人显现给亚伯拉罕；撒拉、亚伯拉罕和他的仆人为他们预备食物，也就是细面饼、公牛犊，以及奶油和牛奶。尽管这些事是描述真实事件的真实历史，但天使仍不以这种历史方式理解它们，而是觉知它们所代表和表示的事物。也就是说，他们照着概览所给出的解读，以完全不同于字义的方式抽象地觉知这些事物。因此，天使所觉知到的是在主的神性本质与人性本质，并人性本质与神性本质的完美融合之前，其人性中的直觉状态和那时与神性的交流，而非本章所讲述的历史事件。这种状态也是主说这些话时所论及的：<br />从来没有人看见神，只有在父怀里的独生子将祂表明出来。（约翰福音<a href="http://39-27.cn/约1.18.htm">1:18</a>）<br />而且，本章所提及的各种食物，天使无非理解为属天和属灵的良善，本章对这些良善的细节给出了解释。后来关于撒拉明年这时候所生儿子的内容，天使无非理解为主人性的理性会变成神性。本章末尾亚伯拉罕就推翻所多玛、蛾摩拉而与耶和华的对话，他们无非理解为主为人类祈求。那里所提及的数字五十、四十五、四十、三十、二十、十，他们理解为主为那些具有要与良善联结的真理，以及通过试探和争战，或其它状态拥有良善之人祈求。他们对圣言中其它事物的理解同样如此，这从所给出的逐句解读更能清楚看出来，那里说明，类似事物就体现在圣言的每句话中，无论历史部分还是预言部分。<br />圣言处处都有这样的内义，这些细节唯独论述主、祂在天上的国度和地上的教会，尤其论述每个人，因而论述爱之善和信之真。谁都能通过福音书从旧约中所引用的经文清楚看出这一点，如马太福音：<br />主对我主说，你坐在我的右边，等我把你仇敌放在你的脚下。（马太福音<a href="http://39-27.cn/太22.44.htm">22:44</a>；诗篇<a href="http://39-27.cn/诗110.1.htm">110:1</a>）<br />这些话论及主，这一点从它们的字义看不出来，不像在诗篇中那样。然而，所表示的是主，而非其他人，在马太福音中，主自己在此也教导了这一点。<br /><br />犹大地的伯利恒啊，你在犹大领袖中并不是最小的，因为将来有一位领袖要从你那里出来，牧养我以色列民。（马太福音<a href="http://39-27.cn/太2.6.htm">2:6</a>；弥迦书<a href="http://39-27.cn/弥5.2.htm">5:2</a>）<br />那些像犹太人那样局限于字义的人的确由此知道主将在那里出生，但由于他们正等候一位领袖和君王来领他们回迦南地，所以他们从字面上解释此处这些话。也就是说，他们将“犹大地”理解为迦南地，将“我以色列民”理解为以色列（各支派），尽管他们不知道现在的以色列在哪里；将“领袖”仍理解为他们的弥赛亚；而事实上，“犹大”和“以色列”用来表示其它事物，而非犹大和以色列；也就是说，“犹大”表那些属天之人，“以色列”表示那些属灵之人，无论在天上还是地上；“领袖”则表示主。<br /><br />在拉玛听见号啕大哭的声音，是拉结哭她儿女，不肯受安慰，因为他们都不在了。（马太福音<a href="http://39-27.cn/太2.18.htm">2:18</a>；耶利米书<a href="http://39-27.cn/耶31.15.htm">31:15</a>）<br />那些局限于字义的人不可能由此获知这些话的内义。然而，这内义的存在从福音书本身就能明显看出来。同一福音书：<br />我从埃及召出我的儿子来。（马太福音<a href="http://39-27.cn/太2.15.htm">2:15</a>；何西阿书<a href="http://39-27.cn/何11.1.htm">11:1</a>）<br />在何西阿书，经上说：<br />以色列为孩提时我爱他，就从埃及召出我的儿子来。他们越发招呼他们，他们越发走开。我曾教导以法莲行走。（何西阿书<a href="http://39-27.cn/何11.1.htm">11:1</a>-<a href="http://39-27.cn/何11.3.htm">3</a>）<br />人若不知道内义的存在，就只能知道此处是指进入埃及时的雅各，以及出埃及时他的后代，“以法莲”则是指以法莲这个支派，因而是指诸如出现在圣言历史部分中的那些事物。尽管如此，从福音书的圣言清楚可知，他们表示主。但人们不可能得知各个细节的含义，除非它们通过内义被揭示出来。</p>

PREFACE TO THE 18th CHAPTER.      At the end of the preceding chapter, the subject of the Last Judgment was treated of, and it was shown what is signified thereby, namely, not the destruction of the 
world, but the last time of the church. When this is at hand, the Lord says that He "will come in the clouds of the heavens, with power and glory" (Matt. 24:30; Mark 13:26; Luke 21:27).  Hitherto no 
one has known what is meant by the "clouds of the heavens." But it has been disclosed to me that nothing else is meant than the literal sense of the Word; and by "power and glory" the internal sense 
of the Word, for in the internal sense of the Word there is glory, since whatever is there is concerning the Lord and His kingdom (see in volume 1, n. 1769-1772).  [2] Similar is the signification of 
the "cloud" which encompassed Peter, James, and John, when the Lord appeared to them in glory; of which it is said in Luke: </p>
<p>     A voice came out of the cloud, saying, This is My beloved Son, hear ye 
Him; but when the voice had passed, Jesus was found alone (Luke 9:35-36), where by "Moses and Elias," who spoke with the Lord, was represented the Word of the Old Testament, which is also called "Moses 
and the Prophets" (by "Moses," his books together with the other historical books, and by "Elias" the prophet, all the books of the Prophets); but by "Peter, James, and John," as in all other places 
where they are named in the books of the Evangelists, were represented faith, charity, and the good of charity. That they only were present signifies that no others can see the glory of the Lord, 
which is in His Word than those who are in faith, in its charity, and in the good of charity. Others are indeed able to see, but still do not see, because they do not believe. This is the internal sense 
in regard to the foregoing two passages; and in various places in the Prophets also, a "cloud" signifies the Word in its letter, and "glory" the Word in its life.  [3] The nature and quality of the 
internal sense of the Word has already been frequently stated, and has been shown in the explication word by word. It was those skilled in the Law in the Lord's time who least of all believed that there 
was anything written in the Word concerning the Lord. At the present day, those skilled in the Law know indeed, but it may be that they will believe least of all that there is any other glory in 
the Word than that which appears in the letter; when yet this is the cloud in which is the glory. </p>
<p>CHAPTER 18. From this chapter we may see, in an especial manner, what is the nature of the internal 
sense of the Word, and how the angels perceive it when it is being read by man. From the historical sense of the letter we can understand nothing else than that Jehovah appeared to Abraham under the 
form of three men; and that Sarah, Abraham, and his lad prepared food for them, namely, cakes made of the meal of fine flour, a "son of an ox," and also butter and milk; which things, though they are 
true historicals describing what really took place, are still not so perceived by the angels; but the things which they represent and signify are what are perceived, altogether abstractedly from the 
letter, in accordance with the explication given in the CONTENTS. Thus, instead of the things historically related in this chapter, the angels perceive the state of the Lord's perception in the Human, 
and the communication with the Divine at that time, before the perfect union of His Divine Essence with the Human Essence, and of the Human Essence with the Divine Essence, which state is also that concerning 
which the Lord thus speaks: </p>
<p>     No one hath seen God at any time; the Only-begotten Son, who is in the bosom of the Father, He hath set Him forth (John 1:18). [2] And by the various kinds 
of food here mentioned, the angels perceive nothing but celestial and spiritual goods, concerning which see the explication. Moreover by what is afterwards said concerning the son that Sarah should bear 
at the set time of another year, they perceive nothing else than that the Lord's human rational should be made Divine. Lastly, by the things which Abraham spoke with Jehovah concerning the overthrow 
of Sodom and Gomorrah, the angels perceive nothing else than the Lord's intercession for the human race; and by five, forty-five, forty, thirty, twenty, and ten, they perceive His intercession for 
those with whom truths should be adjoined to goods, and who should have goods by means of temptations and combats, or by means of other states. So it is with all other things in the Word, as may be more 
clearly seen from the explication word by word, where it is shown that in each word similar things are involved in the Word, both Historic and Prophetic.  [3] That there is such an internal sense 
everywhere in the Word, which treats solely of the Lord, of His kingdom in the heavens, of His church on earth and in particular with every man, thus treating of the goods of love and truths of faith, 
may also be seen by every one from the passages cited by the Evangelists from the Old Testament. As in Matthew: </p>
<p>     The Lord said unto my Lord, Sit thou on My right hand, until I made thine enemies 
thy footstool (Matt. 22:44; compare Ps. 110:1). That these words treat of the Lord, cannot be apparent in the literal sense of the passage cited, as found in David; but yet that no other than the Lord 
is meant, He Himself here teaches in Matthew.  [4] Again: </p>
<p>     Thou Bethlehem, the land of Judah, art in no wise least among the leaders of Judah; for out of thee shall come forth a Leader, who shall 
feed My people Israel (Matt. 2:6; compare Micah 5:2). They who abide in the literal sense, as do the Jews, know indeed from this passage that the Lord should be born there; but as they are expecting 
a leader and a king who will bring them back into the land of Canaan, they therefore explain the words found here according to the letter; that is, by the "land of Judah" they understand the land 
of Canaan; by "Israel" they understand Israel, although they know not where Israel now is; and by a "Leader" they still understand their Messiah; when yet other things are meant by "Judah" and "Israel;" 
namely, by "Judah" those who are celestial, by "Israel," those who are spiritual, in heaven and on earth; and by the "Leader" the Lord.  [5] Again in the same: </p>
<p>     A voice was heard in Ramah, lamentation, 
a cry, and great wailing; Rachel weeping for her children, and she would not be comforted, because they are not (Matt. 2:18; compare Jer. 31:15). They who abide in the literal sense of these 
words cannot possibly gather from it what is the internal sense; and yet that there is an internal sense is evident in the Evangelist. Again: Out of Egypt have I called My Son (Matt. 2:15; compare 
Hos. 11:1). In Hosea it is said: </p>
<p>     When Israel was a child, then I loved him, and called My son out of Egypt. They called them, so they went from their faces, and I made Ephraim to go (Hos. 11:1-3). 
They who know not that there is an internal sense, cannot know otherwise than that Jacob is here meant when he entered into Egypt, and his posterity when they went out from it, and that by Ephraim 
is meant the tribe of Ephraim, thus the same things that are in the historicals of the Word nevertheless it is evident from the Word of the Evangelist that they signify the Lord. But what the several 
particulars signify could not possibly be known unless it were disclosed by means of the internal sense.            GENESIS 18 </p>
<p>     1. And Jehovah appeared unto him in the oak-groves of Mamre, and 
he was sitting at the door of the tent, as the day was growing hot.      2. And he lifted up his eyes and saw, and behold three men standing over him; and he saw, and ran to meet them from the door 
of the tent, and bowed himself toward the earth.      3. And he said, My Lord, if I pray I have found grace in thine eyes, pass not I pray from over thy servant.      4. Let I pray a little water 
be taken, and wash ye your feet, and lie down under the tree.      5. And I will take a piece of bread, and support ye your heart; afterwards ye may pass on; for therefore have ye passed over unto your 
servant. And they said, So do as thou hast spoken.      6. And Abraham hastened toward the tent unto Sarah, and said, Make ready quickly three measures of meal of fine flour, knead, and make cakes.  
    7. And Abraham ran unto the herd and took a son of an ox, tender and good, and gave it to the lad, and he hasted to make it.      8. And he took butter and milk, and the son of an ox that he 
had made, and set before them; and he stood before them under the tree, and they did eat.      9. And they said unto him, Where is Sarah thy wife? And he said, Behold in the tent.      10. And he said, 
Returning I will return unto thee about this time of life, and behold Sarah thy wife shall have a son. And Sarah heard at the door of the tent, and it was behind him.      11. And Abraham and Sarah 
were old, entering into days; it had ceased to be with Sarah in the way as of women.      12. And Sarah laughed within herself, saying, After I am grown old shall I have pleasure? and my lord old?  
    13. And Jehovah said unto Abraham, Wherefore did Sarah laugh, saying, Shall I indeed truly bear, and I am become old?      14. Shall anything be wonderful for Jehovah? At the set time I will return 
unto thee, about this time of life, and Sarah shall have a son.      15. And Sarah denied, saying, I laughed not; for she was afraid. And He said, Nay, for thou didst laugh.      16. And the men 
rose up thence, and looked toward the faces of Sodom; and Abraham went with them, to send them away.      17. And Jehovah said, Shall I hide from Abraham that which I do?      18. And Abraham shall 
surely be for a nation great and numerous, and all the nations of the earth shall be blessed in him.      19. For I know him, because he will command his sons, and his house after him, and they will 
keep the way of Jehovah, to do righteousness and judgment; that Jehovah may bring upon Abraham that which He hath spoken concerning him.      20. And Jehovah said, Because the cry of Sodom and Gomorrah 
has become great, and because their sin has become very grievous.      21. I will go down I pray, and I will see whether they have made a consummation according to the cry thereof which is come 
unto Me, and if not I will know.      22. And the men looked forth thence, and went toward Sodom; and Abraham as yet he was standing before Jehovah.      23. And Abraham drew near, and said, Wilt Thou 
also destroy the righteous with the wicked?      24. Peradventure there be fifty righteous in the midst of the city; wilt Thou also destroy and not spare the place for the sake of the fifty righteous 
that are in the midst of it?      25. Be it far from Thee to do according to this thing, to cause the righteous to die with the wicked, so that the righteous be as the wicked; be it far from Thee; 
shall not the Judge of all the earth do judgment?      26. And Jehovah said, If I find in Sodom fifty righteous in the midst of the city, I will spare all the place for their sake.      27. And Abraham 
answered and said, Behold I pray I have taken upon me to speak unto my Lord, and I am dust and ashes.      28. Peradventure there shall lack five of the fifty righteous; wilt Thou destroy all 
the city for five? and He said, I will not destroy it, if I find there forty and five.      29. And he added yet to speak unto Him, and said, Peradventure forty shall be found there; and He said, I will 
not do it for forty's sake.      30. And he said, Oh let not my Lord be angry, and I will speak: peradventure thirty shall be found there; and He said, I will not do it if I find thirty there.  
    31. And he said, Behold I pray I have taken upon me to speak unto my Lord: peradventure twenty shall be found there; and He said, I will not destroy it for twenty's sake.      32. And he said, Oh 
let not my Lord be angry, and I will speak but this once: peradventure ten shall be found there; and He said, I will not destroy it for ten's sake.      33. And Jehovah went when He had completed His 
speaking unto Abraham; and Abraham returned unto his place. </p>

PREFACE </p>
<p>[Each chapter belonging to Volume Two of the Latin (Chapters <a href="16.htm">16</a>-<a href="21.htm">21</a>) was published separately, and therefore this Preface belongs to Chapter <a href="18.htm">18</a> only.] </p>
<blockquote>
At the end of the previous chapter 
the subject dealt with was the Last Judgement, and there it was shown what is meant by it - not the destruction of the world, but the final period of the Church. When this is imminent, says the Lord, 
He will come in the clouds of heaven with power and glory, <a href="http://bible.gospelcom.net/cgi-bin/bible?passage=Matt%2024:%2030&amp;version=ESV&amp;interface=print&amp;showfn=yes&amp;showxref">Matt 24: 30</a>; <a href="http://bible.gospelcom.net/cgi-bin/bible?passage=Mark%2013:%2026&amp;version=ESV&amp;interface=print&amp;showfn=yes&amp;showxref">Mark 13: 26</a>; <a href="http://bible.gospelcom.net/cgi-bin/bible?passage=Luke%2021:-27&amp;version=ESV&amp;interface=print&amp;showfn=yes&amp;showxref">Luke 21:-27</a>. 
</blockquote>
Nobody until now has known what was meant by 'the clouds of heaven'. But it has been disclosed to me 
that nothing else is meant than the literal sense of the Word, and that by 'power and glory' is meant the internal sense of the Word; for the internal sense of the Word holds glory within itself, since 
everything within that sense has regard to the Lord and His kingdom; see Volume One, in <a href="1769.htm">1769</a>-<a href="1772.htm">1772</a>. Something similar is meant by 'the cloud' which surrounded Peter, James, and John when the Lord appeared 
to them in glory, concerning which the following is said in Luke, </p>
<blockquote>
A voice came out of the cloud, saying, This is My beloved Son; listen to Him! When however the voice had gone Jesus was found 
alone. <a href="http://bible.gospelcom.net/cgi-bin/bible?passage=Luke%209:-35,%2036&amp;version=ESV&amp;interface=print&amp;showfn=yes&amp;showxref">Luke 9:-35, 36</a>. 
</blockquote>
<p>Moses and Elijah there who conversed with the Lord represented the Old Testament Word, which is also called Moses and the Prophets - 'Moses' representing the books by him, together 
with the historical books, 'Elijah the prophet' representing all the Prophets. Peter, James, and John however represented, as they do wherever else they are mentioned in the Gospels, faith, charity, 
and good flowing from charity. Their presence alone on that occasion meant that no others are able to see the glory of the Lord which is present in His Word than those with whom faith, its partner 
charity, and good flowing from charity are present. All others do indeed have the ability to see; nevertheless they do not see because they do not believe. Such is the internal sense of these two 
passages. In various places in the Prophets as well, 'cloud' means the Word as to its letter, and 'glory' the Word as to its life. What the internal sense of the Word is, and the nature of it, has been 
stated in many places, and has been shown in the word-by-word explanation that has been given. Those expert in the Law in the Lord's time had least belief of all in the idea that anything in the Word 
had been written regarding the Lord. Today such experts do, it is true, recognize this, but they perhaps will have least belief of all in the idea that any glory is present in the Word other than that 
visible in the letter - though the letter is in fact the cloud which has the glory within it. </p>
<p>From this chapter especially do the nature of the internal sense of the Word and the manner in which 
angels perceive the Word when it is read by man become clear. From the historical sense that belongs to the letter nothing else is understood than that Jehovah appeared to Abraham in the guise of three 
men, and that Sarah, Abraham, and his servant prepared food for them, namely cakes of fine flour, a young bull, and also butter and milk. Although these are historically true descriptions of things 
which actually took place, they are nevertheless not perceived by angels in any such historical manner. Instead the angels perceive abstractedly, quite apart from the letter, the things which are represented 
and are meant spiritually by such descriptions; that is to say, they perceive them according to the explanation set out in the Contents. In place of the historical details stated in this chapter 
they perceive the state of the Lord's perception within the Human, and also the communication at that time with the Divine, before the perfect union existed of His Divine Essence with His Human Essence 
and of His Human Essence with His Divine Essence, which state is also what the Lord is referring to when He says, </p>
<blockquote>
Nobody has even seen God; the only begotten Son who is in the bosom of the Father, 
He has made Him known. <a href="http://bible.gospelcom.net/cgi-bin/bible?passage=John%201:-18&amp;version=ESV&amp;interface=print&amp;showfn=yes&amp;showxref">John 1:-18</a>. 
</blockquote>
<p></p>
<p><b>[2]</b>
 Also, by the different kinds of food mentioned in this chapter angels perceive nothing else than celestial and spiritual goods, details of which goods are 
given in the explanation of the chapter. And by what is said further on in it about a son whom Sarah would bear at the appointed time in the following year, angels perceive nothing else than this, 
that the Lord's human rational would be made Divine. By what is stated at the end of the chapter about Abraham speaking to Jehovah concerning the overthrow of Sodom and Gomorrah they perceive nothing 
else than the Lord's interceding on behalf of the human race. By the numbers fifty, forty-five, forty; thirty, twenty, and ten mentioned there they perceive His interceding on behalf of those with whom 
truths were to be allied to goods, and to whom goods were to come through temptations and conflicts, or through other states. And their perception is the same with everything else in the Word, as may 
become clearer still from the word-by-word explanation that is given, where it is shown that similar things are embodied within each individual expression in the Word, both in the historical part and 
in the prophetical part.  </p>
<p></p>
<p><b>[3]</b>
 That such an internal sense is present everywhere in the Word, which deals solely with the Lord, with His kingdom in heaven, with His Church on earth, and in particular 
with every individual, and so deals with the goods of love and the truths of faith, may also become clear to anyone from Old Testament texts quoted in the Gospels, as in Matthew, </p>
<blockquote>
The Lord said 
to My Lord, Sit at My right hand, till I make Your enemies Your footstool. <a href="http://bible.gospelcom.net/cgi-bin/bible?passage=Matt%2022:%2044&amp;version=ESV&amp;interface=print&amp;showfn=yes&amp;showxref">Matt 22: 44</a>; <a href="http://bible.gospelcom.net/cgi-bin/bible?passage=Ps%20110:1&amp;version=ESV&amp;interface=print&amp;showfn=yes&amp;showxref">Ps 110:1</a>. 
</blockquote>
<p>That these words refer to the Lord cannot be seen from the literal sense of them as they stand in 
David; yet that no one other than the Lord is meant, He himself teaches at this point in Matthew. </p>
<p></p>
<p><b>[4]</b>
 In the same gospel, </p>
<blockquote>
You, Bethlehem, land of Judah, are by no means least among the leaders 
of Judah, for from you will come a leader who will shepherd my people Israel. <a href="http://bible.gospelcom.net/cgi-bin/bible?passage=Matt%202:%206&amp;version=ESV&amp;interface=print&amp;showfn=yes&amp;showxref">Matt 2: 6</a>; <a href="http://bible.gospelcom.net/cgi-bin/bible?passage=Micah%205:-2&amp;version=ESV&amp;interface=print&amp;showfn=yes&amp;showxref">Micah 5:-2</a>. 
</blockquote>
<p>Those who confine themselves to the literal sense, as Jews do, do indeed know from this that the 
Lord was to be born there; but because they are waiting for a leader and king who will lead them back into the land of Canaan they therefore explain the words here literally. That is to say, they take 
'the land of Judah' to mean the land of Canaan and '[My people] Israel' to mean [the tribes of] Israel, even though they do not know where the latter are now; and 'a leader' they still take to mean 
their Messiah. But in fact 'Judah' and 'Israel' are used to mean things other than Judah and Israel; that is to say, 'Judah' means those who are celestial and 'Israel' those who are spiritual, in heaven 
and on earth. And 'a leader' is used to mean the Lord. </p>
<p></p>
<p><b>[5]</b>
 In the same gospel, </p>
<blockquote>
A voice was heard in Ramah, lamentation, crying out, and much wailing; Rachel weeping for her children, and she 
refused to be consoled because they are not. <a href="http://bible.gospelcom.net/cgi-bin/bible?passage=Matt%202:%2018&amp;version=ESV&amp;interface=print&amp;showfn=yes&amp;showxref">Matt 2: 18</a>; <a href="http://bible.gospelcom.net/cgi-bin/bible?passage=Jer%2031:%2015&amp;version=ESV&amp;interface=print&amp;showfn=yes&amp;showxref">Jer 31: 15</a>. 
</blockquote>
<p>Those who confine themselves to the literal sense cannot possibly gain from it that sense which is the internal meaning of these 
words. Yet the existence of this internal sense is evident from the gospel itself. In the same gospel, </p>
<blockquote>
Out of Egypt have I called My son. <a href="http://bible.gospelcom.net/cgi-bin/bible?passage=Matt%202:%2015&amp;version=ESV&amp;interface=print&amp;showfn=yes&amp;showxref">Matt 2: 15</a>; <a href="http://bible.gospelcom.net/cgi-bin/bible?passage=Hosea%2011:-1&amp;version=ESV&amp;interface=print&amp;showfn=yes&amp;showxref">Hosea 11:-1</a>. 
</blockquote>
<p>In Hosea the wording is, </p>
<blockquote>
When 
Israel was a boy I loved him, and out of Egypt I called My son. [As] they called them, so they went away from their presence. And I taught Ephraim to walk. <a href="http://bible.gospelcom.net/cgi-bin/bible?passage=Hosea%2011:-1-3&amp;version=ESV&amp;interface=print&amp;showfn=yes&amp;showxref">Hosea 11:-1-3</a>. 
</blockquote>
<p>Those who have no knowledge 
of the existence of the internal sense cannot know otherwise than that here Jacob is meant when he entered Egypt, and his descendants when they left, and that 'Ephraim' is used to mean the tribe 
of Ephraim - thus the same things as occur in historical sections of the Word. Nevertheless it is clear from the Word of the Evangelists that they mean the Lord, though what each detail means could 
not possibly be known unless it were disclosed by means of the internal sense. </p>

CAPUT DECIMUM OCTAVUM </p>
<p>Ex hoc capite imprimis constare potest qualis est sensus internus Verbi ac quomodo percipiunt illud angeli cum legitur ab homine: ex sensu litterae historico 
non aliud intelligitur quam quod Abrahamo apparuerit Jehovah sub forma trium virorum; et quod Sarah, Abrahamus, et puer ejus, paraverint cibum pro illis, nempe ex farina similaginis placentas, filium 
bovis, tum butyrum et lac: quae tametsi historica vera sunt quod ita factum, usque non percipiuntur ita ab angelis, sed prorsus abstracte a littera {1} quae repraesentant et significant, secundum 
illa quae in Contentis {2} sunt {3}; nempe pro illis quae ibi historice dicta, status perceptionis Domini in Humano et communicatio tunc cum Divino, ante unionem perfectam Divinae Ipsius Essentiae tum 
Humana et Humanae cum Divina; qui status etiam est de quo Dominus haec dicit, 	Deum nemo vidit unquam, Unigenitus Filius, Qui in sinu Patris est, Ille exposuit, Joh. i 18; </p>
<p>et per cibos ibi memoratos 
nihil nisi caelestia et spiritualia bona; de quibus in explicatione: et porro dein quod dicitur de filio quem pareret Sarah ad tempus statum alterius anni, nihil aliud percipiunt quam quod rationale 
humanum Domini fieret Divinum: demum per illa quae locutus Abraham cum Jehovah {4} de eversione Sodomae et Amorae, nihil aliud quam intercessionem Domini pro humano genere; ac ibi per `quinquaginta, 
quadraginta quinque, quadraginta, triginta, viginti et decem' intercessionem pro illis apud quos vera essent adjuncta bonis, et quibus bona per tentationes et pugnas, aut per alios status: {5} ita se 
habet cum ceteris in Verbo; ut melius constare potest ab explicatione singularum vocum, ubi ostensum quod singulis vocibus similia involvantur in {6} Verbo tam historico quam prophetico.  Quod talis sensus 
internus ubivis in Verbo sit, in quo agitur modo de Domino, de Ipsius regno in caelis, de Ipsius Ecclesia in terris, et in particulari apud unumquemvis, ita de bonis amoris et veris fidei, constare 
etiam unicuique potest ex illis quae ex Veteri Testamento apud Evangelistas citantur, ut apud Matthaeum, 	Dixit Dominus Domino Meo, Sede a dextris Meis, donec ponam inimicos Tuos scabellum pedum 
Tuorum, xxii 42 [A.V.44]; Ps. cx 1; </p>
<p>quae quod agant de Domino, nec a litterali sensu apud Davidem in loco citato apparere potest, sed usque quod non alius intelligatur quam Dominus, Ipse ibi docet: apud 
eundem, 	Tu Bethlehem, terra Jehudae, nequaquam minima es in ducibus Jehudae, ex te enim exibit dux, qui pascet populum Meum Israelem, ii 6; Mich. v 1; </p>
<p>qui in sensu litterali manent, ut Judaei, 
quidem inde sciunt quod ibi nasceretur Dominus, sed quia ducem et regem exspectant, qui in terram Canaanem reducet eos, ideo secundum litteram ibi verba explicant, nempe per `terram Jehudae' terram Canaanem, 
per `Israelem' etiam Israelem, tametsi ignorant ubi est, et per `ducem' adhuc Messiam suum; cum tamen alia per Jehudam et Israelem intelliguntur, nempe per `Jehudam' caelestes, per `Israelem' 
spirituales, in caelo et in terra, et per `ducem' Dominus: apud eundem, 	Vox in Ramah {7} audita est, lamentatio, clamor, et ejulatus multus, Rachel deplorans liberos suos, et non volebat consolationem 
admittere, quia non sunt, ii 18; Jer. xxxi 15; </p>
<p>qui in sensu litterali manent, nusquam inde capiunt illum sensum qui internus eorundem verborum est; qui tamen quod sit, patet apud Evangelistam: apud 
eundem, 	Ex Aegypto vocavi filium Meum, ii 15; Hos. xi 1; </p>
<p>apud hunc prophetam ita dicitur, 	Cum puer Israel, et amavi illum, et ex Aegypto vocavi filium meum: vocarunt illos, sic iverunt a faciebus 
eorum {8};... et Ego feci ire Ephraimum, ibid. 1-3; </p>
<p>qui ignorant dari sensum internum, non aliter possunt scire quam quod hic intelligatur Jacobus, cum ingressus Aegyptum, et ejus posteri, cum inde 
egressi, et quod per `Ephraimum' tribus Ephraimi, ita eadem illa quae in historicis Verbi; sed usque clarum est ex Verbo Evangelistae quod significent Dominum: at quid significat unumquodvis, nisi retegeretur 
per sensum internum, nusquam sciri posset. 	@1 i nempe$ 	@2 i.e. n. 2136-41.$ 	@3 i quae videantur.$ 	@4 Jehova.$ 	@5 i quod haec in sensu interno contineantur, nusquam ex litera apparere 
potest, sed usque quod illa sint, verum est.$ 	@6 i ubivis.$ 	@7 A has Rama as Gk.$ 	@8 Heb. is obscure. In 8869 this is rendered vocaverunt seipsos, sic iverunt propter se ipsos; in 10406 vocaverunt 
seipsos et iverunt e faciebus suis.$ </p>
<p>                          CAPUT XVIII </p>
<p>	1.  Et apparuit illi JEHOVAH, in quercetis Mamre, et ille sedens ad januam tentorii, incalescente die. 	2.  Et 
sustulit oculos suos, et vidit, et ecce tres viri stantes super illum; et vidit, et cucurrit obviam illis, a janua tentorii, et incurvavit se versus terram. 	3.  Et dixit, Domine mi, si quaeso inveni 
gratiam in oculis tuis, ne quaeso transeas desuper servo tuo. 	4. Accipiatur quaeso parum aquae, et lavate pedes vestros, et incumbite sub arbore. 	5.  Et accipiam frustum panis, et fulcite cor vestrum, 
postea transeatis, nam quamobrem transiistis ad servum vestrum; et dixerunt, Ita facias quemadmodum locutus es. 	6.  Et festinavit Abraham versus tentorium ad Sarah, et dixit, Festina tria sata 
farinae similaginis, pinse, et fac placentas. 	7.  Et ad armentum cucurrit Abraham, et accepit filium bovis tenerum et bonum, et dedit ad puerum, et festinavit ad faciendum illum. 	8.  Et accepit 
butyrum et lac, et filium bovis, quem fecit, et dedit coram illis; et ille stans ante illos sub arbore, et comederunt. 	9.  Et dixerunt ad illum, Ubi Sarah uxor tua? et dixit, Ecce in tentorio. 	10. 
 Et dixit, Revertendo revertar ad te juxta tempus hoc vitae et ecce filius Sarae uxori tuae; et Sarah audiens ad januam tentorii et ea post illum. 	11.  Et Abraham et Sarah senes, intrantes in dies, 
desiit esse Sarae via sicut mulierum. 	12.  Et risit Sarah intra se, dicendo, Postquam consenui, num erit mihi voluptas, et dominus meus senex? 	13.  Et dixit JEHOVAH ad Abraham, Cur hoc risit Sarah, 
dicendo, Num etiam vere pariam, et ego consenui? 	14.  Nam mirabile erit pro JEHOVAH quicquam? Ad tempus statum revertar ad te, juxta tempus hoc vitae, et Sarae filius. 	15.  Et negavit Sarah, dicendo, 
Non risi; quia timuit, et dixit, Non, quod risisti. 	16.  Et surrexerunt inde viri, et prospexerunt ad facies Sodomae, et Abraham vadens cum illis, ad dimittendum illos. 	17.  Et JEHOVAH dixit, 
Num celans Ego ab Abrahamo, quod Ego faciens? 	18.  Et Abraham essendo erit in gentem magnam et numerosam; et benedicentur in illo omnes gentes terrae. 	19.  Quia novi illum, propterea quod praecipiet 
filiis suis, et domui suae post se, et custodient viam JEHOVAE ad faciendum justitiam et judicium; propterea ut adducat JEHOVAH super Abrahamum illud quod locutus est super illum. 	20.  Et dixit 
JEHOVAH, Clamor Sodomae et Amorae, quod magnus factus sit, et peccatum eorum quod grave factam valde. 	21.  Descendam quaeso, et videbo, num secundum clamorem ejus, qui venit ad Me, fecerint consummationem; 
et si non, cognoscam. 	22.  Et prospexerunt inde viri, et iverunt versus Sodomam; et Abraham adhuc ille stans coram JEHOVAH. 	23.  Et accessit Abraham, et dixit, Num etiam delebis justum cum 
impio? 	24.  Forte sint quinquaginta justi in medio urbis; num etiam delebis, et non parces loco propter quinquaginta justos, qui in medio ejus? 	25.  Absit Tibi a faciendo secundum rem hanc, ad 
mori faciendum justum cum impio, et sit sic justus sicut impius; absit Tibi, num Judex totius terrae non faciet judicium? 	26.  Et dixit JEHOVAH, Si invenero in Sodoma quinquaginta justos in medio urbis, 
et parcam toti loco propter eos. 	27.  Et respondit Abraham, et dixit, Ecce quaeso suscepi ad loquendum ad Dominum meum, et ego pulvis et cinis. 	28.  Forte defuerint quinquaginta justis quinque, 
num disperdes in quinque totam urbem? Et dixit, Non perdam, si invenero ibi quadraginta quinque. 	29.  Et addidit adhuc loqui ad Ipsum, et dixit, Forte inventi fuerint ibi quadraginta; et dixit, Non 
faciam propter quadraginta. 	30.  Et dixit, Ne quaeso succenseatur Domino meo, et loquar; forte inventi fuerint ibi triginta; et dixit, Non faciam, si invenero ibi triginta. 	31.  Et dixit, Ecce 
quaeso suscepi ad loquendum ad Dominum meum, forte inventi fuerint ibi viginti; et dixit, Non perdam propter viginti. 	32.  Et dixit, Ne quaeso succenseatur Domino meo, et loquar tantum hac vice; forte 
inventi fuerint ibi decem; et dixit, Non perdam propter decem. 	33.  Et ivit JEHOVAH, quando absolvit loqui ad Abrahamum; et Abraham reversus ad locum suum. </p>
