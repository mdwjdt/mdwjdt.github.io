<h3 align="center" class="ired">属天的奥秘 第1054节</h3>
<h4 align="center"></h4><p><strong>1054.</strong>“我看见它”表他是能重生的那类。这一点从以下事实清楚可知，即当论及主时，“看”人表知道他的秉性。主自永恒就了解所有人，故没必要去看人的秉性。人若是能重生的那类，经上就会说主“看见”他，如同还说主向他“仰脸”。但人若无法重生，经上就不会说主看见他，或向他仰脸，而会说主向他“转眼或掩面”，尽管转离的不是主，而是人。所以，第14节论述的主题是整个人类，其中很多人无法重生，故经上没有说“我”看见云彩中的彩虹，而是说彩虹“必现在”云彩中。对主而言，“看见”和“记念”的情形是一样的，从内义上说，“记念”表怜悯（对此，参看<a href="840.htm">840</a>，<a href="1049.htm">1049</a>节，以及<a href="626.htm">626</a>节）。</p>

<p><strong>[NCE]1054.</strong> I will see it means it is a stage in which they can be reborn, as indicated by the fact that seeing someone, when the Lord is said to do so, is being aware of what the person is like. The Lord, after all, has known everyone from eternity past and has no need to "see" what we are like. When we are such that we can regenerate, the Lord is said to see a person, and to lift his face on a person as well.<br />When we are not able to regenerate, however, the Lord is not said to see or to lift his face but to avert his eyes or face — although it is not the Lord who turns away but we ourselves who do. This is why verse <a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_1054/bible_king-james-version_genesis_9_14" target=_top>14</a> above, which treats of the whole human race (including many who cannot regenerate), does not say "when I see the bow in the cloud" but "when the bow is seen in the cloud."<br />This matter of the Lord's seeing is similar to his remembering, which in a deeper sense means having mercy, as stated in <a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_1054/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_840" target=_top>840</a>, <a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_1054/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_1049" target=_top>1049</a>. See the earlier explanation [of divine sight] in <a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_1054/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_626" target=_top>626</a>. </p>

And I will see it. That this signifies that he is such that he can be regenerated, is evident from the fact that to "see" anyone, when predicated of the Lord, means to know his quality. For the Lord 
knows all from eternity, and has no need to see what anyone is. When anyone is such that he can be regenerated, then it is said of the Lord that He "sees" him, as also that He "lifts up His countenance" 
upon him. But when he cannot be regenerated, it is not said that the Lord sees him, or lifts up His countenance upon him, but that He "turns away His eyes" or "His face" from him, although it is not 
the Lord who turns them away, but the man. Hence in the fourteenth verse, where the whole human race was treated of, in which there are many who cannot be regenerated, it is not said, when "I" see the 
bow in the cloud, but when the bow "shall be seen" in the cloud. As regards the Lord, the case is the same with "seeing" as it is with "remembering" which in the internal sense signifies to have mercy. 
(Concerning this see above, n. 840, 1049; and also n. 626.) </p>

<p align="center"><b>Elliott(1983-1999) 1054</b></p><p><b>1054.</b>
'I see it' means that he is such as can be regenerated. This is clear from the fact that in reference to the Lord the expression 'seeing someone' means knowing his character. For the Lord knows all people 
from eternity and has no need to see the character of anyone. When someone is such as can be regenerated, the Lord is spoken of as 'seeing him', as He is also said 'to lift up His face on him'. 
When however he is unable to be regenerated, the Lord is not spoken of as seeing him or of lifting up His face on him, but is spoken of as 'turning His eyes or face away from him', though it is not the 
Lord who turns these away but man. Consequently in previous verses where the subject has been the whole human race among whom very many are not able to be regenerated, the wording is not 'when I see 
the bow in the cloud', but when the bow is seen in the cloud', verse 14. The same applies to the Lord's seeing as to His remembering, which means in the internal sense having mercy, as dealt with above 
in <a href="840.htm">840</a>, <a href="1049.htm">1049</a>. See what has appeared already in <a href="626.htm">626</a>. </p>

<p align="center"><b>Latin(1748-1756) 1054</b>
</p><b>1054.</b>
Quod 'video eum' significet quod talis sit ut regenerari possit, constat ex eo quod 'videre aliquem,' cum praedicatur de Domino, sit nosse qualis est; Dominus enim omnes ab aeterno novit, nec opus habet 
videre qualis est; cum talis ut regenerari possit, tunc praedicatur de Domino quod 'videat aliquem,' sicut etiam quod 'faciem attollat super aliquem': cum autem non regenerari potest, tunc non praedicatur 
quod Dominus videat, sicut quod nec attollat faciem, sed praedicatur quod 'avertat oculos seu faciem,' tametsi Dominus non est Qui avertit sed homo: inde est, ubi prius actum est de Universo 
genere humano, in quo plures sunt qui non regenerari possunt, quod non dictum sit, 'cum video arcum in nube' sed 'cum videtur arcus in nube,' vers. 14; videre se similiter habet ac recordari apud Dominum, 
quod significat in sensu interno misereri, de quo supra n. 840, 1049; videantur quae prius n. 626. </p>
