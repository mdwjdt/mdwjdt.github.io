<h3 align="center" class="ired">属天的奥秘 第1967节</h3>
<h4 align="center"></h4><p><strong>1967.</strong>有些人反复宣扬自己所看到的异象，声称他们曾看到过很多事物。诚然，他们的确看到了，然而却是在幻觉中看到的。关于它们，我已得到指教，也被显明它们是如何发生的。有些灵人能通过幻觉使得如构成异象那样的表象看似真实的物体。例如，若某种事物在阴影中，或月光下，甚至在白天被看到，若这个物体在暗处，这些灵人就会将观看者的心思不断锁定在某个具体事物的想法中，无论这个事物是活物、怪物、森林，抑或是其它某个具体物。心思总是全神贯注于这个想法，幻觉就会增长，甚至长到这个人深信不疑，视这些形像为绝对真实的物体的地步，而事实上，它们无非是幻觉。这种事会临到那些沉溺于幻想、意志不坚强，从而易轻信的人身上。这些人都是幻想家。</p>

Much has been said about the visions of certain persons who have declared that they have seen many things, and who did see them, but in phantasy. I have been instructed about them, and it was likewise 
shown how they take place. There are spirits who by means of phantasies induce appearances that seem to be real. For example, if anything is seen in shadow, or in moonlight, or even in daylight, if 
the object be in a dark place, these spirits keep the mind of the beholder fixedly and continually in the thought of someone thing, be it an animal, a monster, a forest, or any other thing; and so long 
as the mind is held in this thought, the phantasy is increased, and it grows to such a degree that the person is persuaded, and sees just as if the things themselves were there, whereas they are nothing 
but illusions. Such things befall those who indulge much in fancies, and are subject to infirmity of mind, and have thereby become credulous. These are visionaries. </p>

Declared repeatedly are visions seen by certain people who have said that they have seen many things, which they have indeed seen, yet only in delusion. I have been informed about them and also shown 
how they originate. There are spirits who by means of delusions can cause shapes like those that constitute visions to appear to be real objects. For example, when something is seen in shadow, or in 
moonlight, or even in daylight provided that the object is where it is unlit, those spirits rivet the mind of the beholder constantly to the idea of some specific thing- whether a living creature, a monster, 
a forest, or some other thing. All the time the mind is riveted to that idea the delusion is increased, and grows to such an extent that that person is quite convinced and sees the shapes as being 
absolutely real objects, when in fact they are nothing other than illusions. Such things happen to those who are much inclined to delusions, who are not strong-minded, and who are therefore prone 
to believe anything. These are visionaries. </p>

</p><b>1967.</b>
Venditantur visiones quorundam qui dixerunt se vidisse plura, etiam viderunt sed in phantasia; instructus sum de iis, et ostensum quoque, quomodo existunt; sunt spiritus qui inducunt tales {1} species 
per phantasias, ut appareant sicut forent, ut dum in umbra aliquid vident, aut in lumine lunari, aut etiam in die si objectum in obscuro, tunc spiritus tenent animum ejus in cogitatione alicujus rei 
fixe et continenter, sive animalis, sive monstri, sive silvae sive alius cujuspiam rei, in qua quamdiu tenetur, phantasia augetur et crescit usque adeo ut persuadeatur, et videat prorsus sicut ipsa 
forent; cum tamen nihil aliud sunt quam illusiones: cadunt in eos qui phantasiis multum indulgent et in infirmitate animi sunt, et inde facti creduli; sunt hi visionarii. 	@1 apud homines.$ </p>
