<h3 align="center" class="ired">属天的奥秘 第3538节</h3>
<h4 align="center"></h4><p><strong>3538.</strong>“家里她所存”表它们经由神圣理性的神圣真理从神圣良善而来。这从利百加的代表和“家”的含义清楚可知：此处“她”所指的利百加是指神圣理性的神圣真理，如前所述；“家”在此是指神圣良善，因为它论及主。“家”表良善（参看<a href="710.htm">710</a>，<a href="2233.htm">2233</a>，<a href="2234.htm">2234</a>，<a href="2559.htm">2559</a>，<a href="3128.htm">3128</a>节）。<br />“家里她所存”这句话之所以表示这些事，是因为“家”既表示理性层的良善，也表示理性层的真理，或也可说，既表示理性心智的意愿部分，就是良善的居所，也表示理性心智的理解力部分，也就是真理的居所。当理性层通过意愿部分或良善，经由理解力部分或真理发挥功能时，在这种情况下，理性心智就被称为“一个家”。天堂本身也由此被称为“神的家”或“神的殿”，因为天堂无非在于良善与真理，良善通过与其联结或结合的真理发挥功能。这也体现在构成一个家的丈夫与妻子之间的婚姻上，原因在于，婚姻之爱就源于良善与真理的神圣婚姻（<a href="2728.htm">2728</a>，<a href="2729.htm">2729</a>，<a href="3132.htm">3132</a>节），并且丈夫与妻子凭良善而拥有一个意愿。然而也有不同，这种不同就像良善与它自己的真理的关系。因此，“丈夫”也表示良善，“妻子”表真理。因为当家只有一个时，在这种情况下，良善就是家里的全部，而真理因与良善结婚，故也是良善。经上之所以说“家里她所存”，而不是“他”或“他们”，是因为现在的主题是真理与良善联结的状态，也就是它们完全结合或融合之前的状态。接下来就描述这种状态。</p>

That were with her in the house. That this signifies that were from the Divine good through the Divine truth of the Divine rational, is evident from the representation of Rebekah, who is here meant by 
"her," as being the Divine truth of the Divine rational (concerning which above); and from the signification of "house," as being here the Divine good, because it is predicated of the Lord (that "house" 
is good may be seen above, n. 710, 2233, 2234, 2559, 3128). That these things are signified by the words "that were with her in the house," is because by "house" is signified the rational both as 
to good and as to truth; or what is the same, both as to the will part, which is of good, and as to the intellectual part, which is of truth. When the rational acts from the will part or good, through 
the intellectual part or truth, then the rational mind is called "one house." From this also heaven itself is called the "house of God," because therein is nothing else than good and truth, and the 
good acts through truth united or conjoined with itself. This is also represented in marriages between a husband and wife who constitute one house, by reason that conjugial love comes forth from the Divine 
marriage of good and truth (n. 2728, 2729, 3132); and both the husband and the wife have a will from good, but with a difference such as is that of good in respect to its own truth; and therefore 
good is signified by the husband, and truth by the wife; for when there is one house, then good is the all therein, and truth, being of good, is also good. The reason why it is said, "with her in the 
house," not "with him" or "with them," is that the subject now is the state of the conjunction of truth and good, that is, the state before they were fully united or conjoined, which state is now to 
be described. </p>

'Which were with her in the house' means which come from Divine Good by way of the Divine Truth of the Divine Rational. This is clear from the representation of Rebekah, to whom the pronoun 'her' refers 
here, as the Divine Truth of the Divine Rational, dealt with already, and from the meaning of 'the house' as Divine Good in this instance because it has reference to the Lord. As regards 'house' meaning 
good, see <a href="710.htm">710</a>, <a href="2233.htm">2233</a>, <a href="2234.htm">2234</a>, <a href="2559.htm">2559</a>, <a href="3128.htm">3128</a>. The reason why these considerations are meant by the words 'which were with her in the house' is that 'the house' means the rational both as regards good 
and as regards truth, or what amounts to the same, as regards both the will part of the mind, the dwelling-place of good, and the understanding part, the dwelling-place of truth When the rational functions 
from the will or from good, by way of the understanding or of truth, the rational mind in that case is called 'one house'. This also is why heaven itself is called 'the house of God', for heaven 
consists of nothing else than good and truth, with good functioning through truth united or joined to itself. This is also represented in marriages in which husband and wife constitute one house, the 
reason being that conjugial love originates in the Divine marriage of good and truth, <a href="2728.htm">2728</a>, <a href="2729.htm">2729</a>, <a href="3132.htm">3132</a>, and forms the will of the two of them by virtue of good. There is a difference however, which is 
like the relationship of good to its own truth. Consequently 'husband' also means good and 'wife' truth. For when the house is one, good is in that case the all in it, and truth, being wedded to good, 
is good as well. The reason why the phrase 'with her in the house' is used, and not with him or with them, is that the subject is the state of conjunction of truth and good, that is, the state prior 
to their being fully united or joined together. This state is dealt with next. </p>

`Quae cum illa in domo': quod significet quae ex Divino Bono per Divinum Verum Divini Rationalis, constat ex repraesentatione Rebeccae, quae hic est `illa,' quod sit Divinum Verum Divini Rationalis: 
de qua prius; et ex significatione `domus' quod hic sit Divinum Bonum, quia praedicatur de Domino; quod `domus' sit bonum, videatur n. 710, 2233, {1}2234, 2559, 3128; quod illa significentur per ea verba 
`quae cum illa in domo,' est quia per `domum' significatur rationale tam quoad bonum quam quoad verum, seu quod idem, tam quoad voluntarium, hoc enim est boni, quam quoad intellectuale, quia hoc 
est veri; quando rationale ex voluntario seu bono agit per intellectuale seu verum, tunc mens rationalis vocatur `una domus'; inde etiam ipsum caelum vocatur `domus Dei,' quia ibi non nisi quam bonum 
et verum est, ac bonum agit per sibi unitum aut conjunctum verum; hoc quoque repraesentatur in conjugialis inter maritum et {2}uxorem, qui unam domum constituunt, ex causa quia amor {3}conjugialis existit 
a conjugio Divino boni et veri, n. 2728, 2729, 3132, et est voluntas utrique ex bono, sed cum differentia sicut bonum se habet ad {4}suum verum, {5}quare etiam per `maritum' significatur bonum, et 
per {2}uxorem verum; cum enim una domus est, tunc bonum est omne ibi, ac verum quia est boni, etiam est bonum. Quod dicatur `cum illa in domo,' non cum illo seu cum illis, est quia de statu conjunctionis 
veri et boni, seu de statu antequam plene unita aut conjuncta sunt, agitur; de quo statu nunc sequitur. @1 2234 has no. ref. to domus$  @2 i ejus$  @3 i genuinus$  @4 ejus$  @5 inde est quod$  </p>
