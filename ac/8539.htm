<h3 align="center" class="ired">属天的奥秘 第8539节</h3>
<h4 align="center"></h4><p><strong>8539.</strong>“他们吃吗哪，直到进了迦南地的边界”表他们继续将来自真理的良善变成他们自己的，直到他们到达天堂的区域。这从“吗哪”、“吃”和“迦南地”的含义清楚可知：“吗哪”是指真理之良善；“吃”是指变成人自己的（参看<a href="8537.htm">8537</a>节）；“迦南地”是指天堂（参看<a href="8538.htm">8538</a>节），因此，“迦南地的边界”是指天堂的入口，或天堂开始的区域。从这些含义明显可知，“他们吃吗哪，直到进了迦南地的边界”表示他们正将真理之良善变成他们自己的，直到他们到达天堂的区域。<br />这一切的性质可从前面关于通过真理获得良善的阐述明显可知，即：在重生之前，一切良善都是通过真理获得的；但重生之后，人被主通过良善引导；前一种状态由第七天之前的“六天”来表示，后一种状态由“第七天”或“安息日”来表示。由此也明显可知，前一种状态由以色列人在旷野漂流四十年来代表，后一种状态由他们被领进迦南地来代表。事实上，情况是这样：只要人出于真理，而非良善行事，他就在天堂之外；当他出于良善行事时，便进入天堂，因为那时，他被主照着天堂的秩序驱使；在他做好准备，也就是当他通过真理被带向良善时的情形发生之前，他不会获得这种秩序，因而也不会进入秩序所在并且就是秩序的天堂。关于两这种状态，可参看前面的说明（<a href="7923.htm">7923</a>，<a href="8505.htm">8505</a>，<a href="8506.htm">8506</a>，<a href="8510.htm">8510</a>，<a href="8512.htm">8512</a>，<a href="8516.htm">8516</a>节）。</p>

They did eat the manna until they came unto the border of the land of Canaan. That this signifies that there was appropriation of good from truth by them until they came to the region of heaven, is evident 
from the signification of "the manna," as being the good of truth; from the signification of "eating," as being appropriation (see above, n. 8537); and from the signification of "the land of Canaan," 
as being heaven (see above, n. 8538); thus "the border of the land of Canaan" denotes the entrance to heaven, or the region where heaven begins. From all this it is evident that by their "eating 
the manna until they came to the border of the land of Canaan" is signified that the good of truth was appropriated by them even up to the region of heaven.  [2] How the case herein is, is evident 
from what was said before concerning the acquisition of good by means of truth, namely, that before regeneration all good is procured by means of truth, but that after regeneration man is led of the Lord 
by means of good; and that the former state is signified by "the six days" which precede the seventh, and that the latter state is signified by "the seventh day" or "the Sabbath." From this it is 
also plain that the former state was represented by the journeyings of the sons of Israel in the wilderness forty years, and that the latter state was represented by their introduction into the land of 
Canaan. The case herein is that man is outside of heaven so long as he acts from truth and not from good; and he comes into heaven when he acts from good, for he is then actuated by the Lord according 
to the order of heaven, into which he does not come, consequently not into heaven, where order is, until he has been prepared, which is effected for good through truth. (On these two states, see what 
has been shown above, n. 7923, 8505, 8506, 8510, 8512, 8516.) </p>

'They ate the man[na] until they came to the border of the land of Canaan' means that they went on making good from truth their own, until they reached the region of heaven. This is clear from the meaning 
of 'the man[na]' as the good of truth; from the meaning of 'eating' as making one's own, as just above in <a href="8537.htm">8537</a>; and from the meaning of 'the land of Canaan' as heaven, as above in <a href="8538.htm">8538</a>, so that 
'the border of the land of Canaan' is the entrance to heaven, or the region where heaven begins. From all these meanings it is evident that 'they ate the man[na] until they came to the border of the land 
of Canaan' means that they were making the good of truth their own until they reached the region of heaven. </p>

<p><b>[2]</b>
 The nature of all this is evident from what has been stated already about the acquisition 
of good through truth. It has been stated that before regeneration all good is obtained by means of truth, but that after regeneration a person is led by the Lord by means of good; also that 
the former state is meant by the six days which come before the seventh, and that the latter state is meant by the seventh day or the sabbath. From this it is also evident that the former state was represented 
by the travels of the children of Israel in the wilderness for forty years, and that the latter state was represented by their being led into the land of Canaan. For the situation is this: A 
person is outside heaven all the time that his actions spring from truth and not from good. But then he enters heaven when they do spring from good; for they now spring from the Lord and are in keeping 
with the order of heaven. He does not attain this order, nor does he therefore enter heaven where order exists and which is order until he has been prepared, which happens when he is brought to good 
by means of truth. Regarding these two states, see what has been shown above in <a href="7923.htm">7923</a>, <a href="8505.htm">8505</a>, <a href="8506.htm">8506</a>, <a href="8510.htm">8510</a>, <a href="8512.htm">8512</a>, <a href="8516.htm">8516</a>. </p>

</p><b>8539.</b>
`Man comederunt usque ad venire illos ad terminum terrae Canaanis': quod significet quod appropriatio boni ex vero illis fuisset usque dum ad regionem caeli venirent, constat ex significatione `man' 
quod sit bonum veri; {1} ex significatione `comedere' quod sit appropriatio, ut mox supra n. 8537; ex significatione `terrae Canaanis' quod sit caelum, ut supra n. 8538; ita `terminus terrae Canaanis' 
est introitus ad caelum, seu regio ubi caelum incipit; ex his patet quod per `man comederunt usque ad venire illos ad terminum terrae Canaanis' significetur quod appropriaretur illis bonum veri usque 
ad regionem caeli. 	2 Quomodo cum his se habet, patet ex illis quae prius dicta sunt de acquisitione boni per verum, quod nempe ante regenerationem omne bonum comparetur per verum, at post regenerationem 
quod ducatur homo a Domino per bonum; quodque prior status significetur per sex dies qui praecedunt septimum, et quod posterior status significetur per diem septimum seu sabbatum; inde quoque patet 
quod prior status repraesentatus sit per {2}profectiones filiorum Israelis in deserto quadraginta annis, et quod posterior status {3}repraesentatus sit per introductionem illorum in terram Canaanem; 
nam cum his ita se habet: homo extra caelum est quamdiu ex vero agit et non ex bono, et {4}tunc in caelum venit cum ex bono, agitur enim (d)tunc a Domino secundum ordinem caeli, in quem non venit, 
proinde non in caelum, ubi est ordo, et quod est ordo, priusquam praeparatus est, quod (x)fit ad bonum per verum; de utroque hoc statu videantur quae supra n. 7923, 8505, 8506, 8510, 8512, 8516, ostensa 
sunt. 	@1 i et$ 	@2 vitam$ 	@3 repraesentetur$ 	@4 quod tunc in coelum veniat$ </p>
