<h3 align="center" class="ired">属天的奥秘 第10299节</h3>
<h4 align="center"></h4><p><strong>10299</strong>.“照着香膏配制师的手工，就是一种香膏”表由于在每一个部分里面的主之神性的流注和运作。这从“膏”或“香膏”和“香膏配制师或制膏者的手工”的含义清楚可知：“膏”或“香膏”是指在敬拜的每一个部分里面的真理（参看<a href="10264.htm">10264</a>节）；“香膏配制师或制膏者的手工”是指神性本身的流注和运作（<a href="10265.htm">10265</a>节）。<br />还必须简要说明当如何理解这一点，即：流注和运作必须存在于敬拜的每一个部分里面。那些对天堂的奥秘一无所知的人以为，敬拜始于此人自己，因为它是从他里面的思维和感觉或情感发出的。但始于此人的敬拜不是真正的敬拜，因此始于此人的感恩、崇拜和祷告不是蒙主垂听并接受的感恩、崇拜和祷告。它们必须始于与此人同在的主自己。教会知道这是真的，因为它教导，没有任何良善是从人发出的，相反，一切良善皆来自天堂，也就是始于那里的神；还教导，祂是敬拜里面的一切良善的源头，没有良善的敬拜不是敬拜。因此，教会无论从事什么圣事，都会祷告神同在，并引导思维和言语。此处的情形是这样：当一个人进行真正的敬拜时，主会流入与此人同在的良善和真理，把它们提升到自己这里，并提升与它们同在的这个人，是照着它们掌管他的方式和程度而如此行的。这种提升不会显明给这个人，除非他拥有对真理和良善的真正情感，知道、承认并相信一切良善都从上头来，是从主开始的。<br />甚至连那些通晓世事的人也能明白这一事实，因为他们根据自己所获得的学识知道，没有他们所说的属世流注，或物质流注这回事，只有属灵的流注；也就是说，任何东西都无法从自然界流入天堂，只能从天堂流入自然界。由此可见当如何理解主之神性的流注和运作必须存在于敬拜的每一个部分里面。我也被允许通过大量经历获知，事实的确如此；因为我被允许感受到实际的流注，对存在于我里面的真理的召唤，把它们联结到祷告的对象上，以及所伴随的对良善的情感和实际的提升。<br />尽管如此，一个人绝不可以垂手等候流注到来，因为这就像一个无生命的雕像。一个人必须貌似凭自己思考、意愿和行动，然而又必须将其一切真理的思维和朝向良善的努力都归于主。当这种情况发生时，主就将接受祂和来自祂的流注的能力植入这个人里面。<br />因为人被造没有别的目的，只是为了成为神性的一个容器；接受神性 的能力不是以其它方式在他里面形成的。一旦这种能力在他里面形成，他就没有其它愿望，只希望情况就是这样，因为他喜爱来自主的流注，厌恶独自的任何运作。这是因为来自主的流注是良善的流注，而独自的运作是邪恶的运作。天上的所有天使都处于这种状态，这就是为何在圣言中，“天使（经上或译为使者）”表示源于主的真理和良善；因为天使是它们的接受者（<a href="1925.htm">1925</a>，<a href="3039.htm">3039</a>，<a href="4085.htm">4085</a>，<a href="4295.htm">4295</a>，<a href="8192.htm">8192</a>节）。</p>

An ointment the work of a perfumer. That this signifies from the influx and operation of the Divine of the Lord into each and all things, is evident from the signification of "ointment," or "aromatic," 
as being truths in each and all things of worship (see n. 10264); and from the signification of "the work of an ointment maker" or "perfumer," as being the influx and operation of the Divine Itself 
(n. 10265).  [2] How it is to be understood that there must be influx and operation into each and all things of worship shall also be briefly told. It is believed by those who are not acquainted with 
the arcana of heaven that worship is from man, because it proceeds from the thought and affection which are in him; but the worship which is from man is not worship, consequently the confessions, adorations, 
and prayers which are from man, are not confessions, adorations, and prayers which are heard and received by the Lord; but they must be from the Lord Himself with man. That this is so is known 
to the church, for it teaches that nothing that is good proceeds from man, but that all good is from heaven, that is, from the Divine there. From this also is all the good in worship; and worship without 
good is not worship; consequently in holy worship the church prays that God may be present and lead the thoughts of the discourse. The case herein is this. When a man is in genuine worship, then 
the Lord flows into the goods and truths which are with him, and raises them to Himself, and with them the man, insofar and in such a manner as he is in them. This elevation does not appear to the man 
unless he is in the genuine affection of truth and good, and in the knowledge, acknowledgment, and faith that everything good comes from above, from the Lord. [3] That it is so may be comprehended 
even by those who are wise from the world, for they know from their learning that natural influx, which is called by them physical influx, is not possible, but only spiritual influx; that is, that nothing 
can flow in from the natural world into heaven, but only from heaven into the world. From all this it can be seen how it is to be understood that the influx and operation of the Divine of the Lord 
are into each and all things of worship. That it is so has frequently been given me to experience; for it has been given me to perceive the very influx, the calling forth of the truths which were with 
me, their application to the objects of prayer, the affection of good that was adjoined, and the elevation itself. [4] Nevertheless a man must not let down his hands and await influx, for this would 
be to act like an effigy devoid of life; in spite of all he must think, will, and act as of himself, and yet must ascribe to the Lord everything of thought of truth and of endeavor of good; by so 
doing there is implanted in him by the Lord the capability of receiving Him and the influx from Him.  [5] For man was created no otherwise than to be a receptacle of the Divine; and the capability of 
receiving the Divine is formed in no other way. When this capability has been formed, he afterward has no other will than that it should be so; for he loves the influx from the Lord, and is averse to 
any working from himself; because the influx from the Lord is the influx of good, whereas any working from himself is the working of evil. In such a state are all the angels in heaven; therefore by "angels" 
in the Word are signified truths and goods which are from the Lord, because the angels are receptions of these (n. 1925, 3039, 4085, 4295, 8192). </p>

<p align="center"><b>Elliott(1983-1999) 10299</b></p><p><b>10299.</b>
'An ointment, the work of an ointment-maker' means as a result of the influx and operation of what is Divine and the Lord's within every single part. This is clear from the meaning of 'ointment', or 
perfume, as the kinds of truth within every single part of the worship, dealt with in <a href="10264.htm">10264</a>; and from the meaning of 'the work of an ointment-maker (or perfumer)' as the influx and operation of Divinity 
itself, dealt with in <a href="10265.htm">10265</a>.  </p>
<p></p>
<p><b>[2]</b>
 How to understand this, that the influx and operation must exist within every single part of the worship, must also be stated briefly. Those who have no knowledge 
of the arcana of heaven suppose that worship begins in the person himself since it flows from the thought and feelings within him. But worship that begins in the person is not true worship; consequently 
offerings of thanksgiving, adoration, and prayer which begin in the person are not the offerings of thanksgiving, adoration, and prayer that are heard and accepted by the Lord. They must begin in 
the Lord present with the person. The Church knows that this is so, for it teaches that no good thing emanates from man, but that everything good comes from heaven, that is, begins in God there; also 
that He is the source of all that is good within worship, and that worship devoid of what is good is not worship. The Church therefore, when engaged in anything holy, prays that God may be present, 
giving guidance to thought and speech. What happens in all this is that when a person is engaged in true worship the Lord flows into the forms of good and the truths present with the person, raises them 
towards Himself, and raises the person with them, in the measure and degree that they govern him. This raising is not apparent to the person if he does not have any real affection for truth and good, 
and does not know, acknowledge, and believe that everything good comes from above, beginning in the Lord.  </p>
<p></p>
<p><b>[3]</b>
 Even those who are knowledgeable about worldly things can grasp the truth of this, 
for they know from the learning they have received that there is no such thing as natural influx, or physical influx as they term it, only spiritual influx; that is, nothing can flow from the natural 
world into heaven, only from heaven into the natural world. All this goes to show how to understand the explanation that the influx and operation of what is Divine and the Lord's must exist in every single 
part of the worship. I have also been allowed to learn by much experience that it is so; for I have been allowed to feel the actual influx, the calling forth of the truths present within me, the 
linking of them to the objects of prayer, the accompanying affection for good, and the actual raising up.  </p>
<p></p>
<p><b>[4]</b>
 But though all this is so, a person ought not to let hands hang down and wait for influx 
to come, for that would be behaving like a lifeless statue. A person should think, will, and act as if doing so all by himself, yet should attribute to the Lord all his thought of what is true and 
endeavour towards what is good. When this happens the Lord implants within the person the ability to receive Him and influx from Him.  </p>
<p></p>
<p><b>[5]</b>
 For the human being was created with no other end in view 
than to be a receptacle of the Divine; and the ability to receive the Divine is formed within him in no other way. Once it has been formed in him he has no other wish than that the situation should be 
such, for he loves the influx from the Lord and loathes operating all by himself. This is because influx from the Lord is the influx of good, whereas operating all by oneself is the operation of evil. 
All the angels in heaven feel the same way, which is why in the Word truths and forms of good derived from the Lord are meant by angels; for they are recipients of them, see <a href="1925.htm">1925</a>, <a href="3039.htm">3039</a>, <a href="4085.htm">4085</a>, <a href="4295.htm">4295</a>, <a href="8192.htm">8192</a>.  </p>

`Unguentum, opus unguentarii':  quod significet ex influxu et operatione Divini Domini in omnia et singula, constat ex significatione `unguenti' seu aromatici, quod sint vera in omnibus et singulis 
cultus, de qua n. 10,264, et ex significatione `operis unguentarii' seu aromatarii, quod sit influxus et operatio ipsius Divini, de qua n. 10,265. 	[2] Quomodo intelligendum quod influxus et operatio 
{1} erit in omnia et singula cultus, etiam paucis dicetur: creditur ab illis qui non sciunt arcana caeli quod cultus sit ab homine, quia procedit ex cogitatione et ex affectione, quae sunt apud illum; 
sed cultus qui ab homine, non est cultus, consequenter confessiones, adorationes, et preces quae sunt ab homine, non sunt confessiones, adorationes, et preces quae audiuntur et recipiuntur a Domino, 
sed erunt ab Ipso Domino apud hominem; quod ita sit, {2} Ecclesia novit, docet enim quod ab homine non aliquid bonum procedat, sed quod omne bonum sit e caelo, hoc est, a Divino ibi; inde quoque omne 
bonum in cultu, et cultus absque bono non est cultus; Ecclesia inde orat, cum in sancto est, ut Deus praesens sit, et ducat cogitata et sermonem; cum his ita se habet: cum homo est in cultu genuino, 
tunc influit Dominus in bona et vera quae apud hominem, et elevat illa ad se, et cum illis hominem, quantum et qualiter in illis est; haec elevatio non apparet homini si non in genuina affectione veri 
(c)et boni sit, ac in cognitione, {3} agnitione, et fide, quod omne bonum veniat desuper a Domino. 	[3] Quod ita sit, etiam illi qui e mundo sapiunt capere possunt, illi enim ex sua eruditione sciunt 
quod non detur influxus naturalis, qui illis vocatur influxus physicus, sed influxus spiritualis, hoc est, quod e naturali mundo in caelum nihil influere possit, sed vice versa. Ex his {4} constare 
potest quomodo intelligendum quod influxus et operatio Divini Domini sit in omnia et singula cultus. Quod ita sit, etiam saepe experiri datum est, nam datum est percipere ipsum influxum, evocationem verorum 
quae apud me, applicationem {5} ad objecta orationis, affectionem {6}boni adjunctam, et ipsam elevationem. 	[4] Sed tametsi ita est, usque homo non remittere manus debet et exspectare influxum, 
nam hoc foret agere simulacrum absque vita; debet usque cogitare, velle, et agere sicut a se, et tamen omne cogitationis veri et conatus boni addicare (x)Domino; {7}per id illi implantatur facultas 
a Domino recipiendi Ipsum, et influxum ab Ipso. 	[5] Homo enim non aliter creatus est quam ut sit receptaculum Divini, ac facultas recipiendi Divinum non aliter formatur; formata facultate dein nec aliter 
vult quam ut ita sit, amat enim influxum a Domino (c)ac aversatur operationem a semet, quoniam influxus a Domino est influxus boni, at {8}operatio a semet est {8}operatio mali. In tali statu sunt 
omnes angeli in caelo, quapropter per illos in Verbo significantur vera et bona quae a Domino, quoniam sunt receptiones eorum, videatur n. 1925, 3039, 4085, 4295, 8192. @1 i Divini Domini$ @2 i etiam$ @3
