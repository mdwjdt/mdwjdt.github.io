<h3 align="center" class="ired">属天的奥秘 第8754节</h3>
<h4 align="center"></h4><p><strong>8754.</strong>此处有必要用几句话来说一说要植入真理的良善，这良善在此由“西乃的旷野”来表示。正在重生之人首先被主通过真理引导，后来通过良善被引导（参看<a href="7923.htm">7923</a>，<a href="8643.htm">8643</a>，<a href="8648.htm">8648</a>，<a href="8658.htm">8658</a>，<a href="8685.htm">8685</a>，<a href="8690.htm">8690</a>，<a href="8701.htm">8701</a>节）。正在重生的人通过真理被引导，是为了叫他能到达良善，也就是能知道良善，然后意愿它，最后行出它。但正当他通过真理被引向良善时，首先到达还没有植入信之真理的良善；因为在他处于良善之前，真理无法被植入。在此之前，他虽知道它们，因为它们存在他的记忆里；然而，这时它们不在良善之内，而是在良善之外。后来当此人接受新生命时，他处于良善的时候，第一次接受这生命，信之真理才被植入，在内在人里面可以说进入与良善的一个婚姻。还没有植入信之真理，但却被如此安排，以致它能接受它们的这种良善，在此由“西乃的旷野”来表示。所表示的是基督良善，不是其它种类的良善（对此，参看<a href="8635.htm">8635</a>-<a href="8638.htm">8638</a>节）。</p>

A few words shall here be said about the good in which truths are to be implanted, which good is here signified by "the wilderness of Sinai." (That the man who is being regenerated is first led by the 
Lord by means of truth, and afterward by means of good, see n. 7923, 8643, 8648, 8658, 8685, 8690, 8701.) He who is being regenerated is led by means of truth to the intent that he may come to good, 
that is, may know it, and then will it, and finally do it. But when he is being led to good by means of truth, he first comes to the good in which the truths of faith have not yet been implanted; for 
truths cannot be implanted until he is in good. Before this they are indeed known, because they are in the memory, but at this time they are not in good, but are outside of good. Afterward when the man 
receives new life, which he first receives when he is in good, the truths of faith are implanted, and as it were enter upon a marriage with good in the internal man. This good, in which the truths 
of faith have not yet been implanted, but which is still so disposed that they can be received, is here meant by "the wilderness of Sinai." No other good is meant than Christian good (on which see n. 
8635-8638). </p>

<p align="center"><b>Elliott(1983-1999) 8754</b></p><p><b>8754.</b>
A brief statement will be made here about good in which truths are to be implanted, meant here by 'the wilderness of Sinai'. A person who is being regenerated is led by the Lord at first by means of 
truth, and later on by means of good, see <a href="7923.htm">7923</a>, <a href="8643.htm">8643</a>, <a href="8648.htm">8648</a>, <a href="8658.htm">8658</a>, <a href="8685.htm">8685</a>, <a href="8690.htm">8690</a>, <a href="8701.htm">8701</a>. The person who is being regenerated is led by means of truth to the end that he may come to good, that is, come to know 
it, then intend it, and finally do it. But when he is being led to good by means of truth he comes first to good which has not as yet had the truths of faith implanted within it; for truths cannot 
be implanted until he is governed by good. He already knows them, it is true, because they are present in his memory; yet they do not at this time reside within good but lie outside good. Later on when 
the person receives a new life, which he first receives when he is governed by good, the truths of faith are implanted, and within the internal man they enter into a marriage so to speak with good. 
This good in which the truths of faith have not as yet been implanted but which is nevertheless so arranged that it can receive them is meant here by 'the wilderness of Sinai'. No other kind of good 
than Christian good is meant, regarding which see <a href="8635.htm">8635</a>-<a href="8638.htm">8638</a>. </p>

Paucis hic dicetur de bono in quo vera implantanda sunt, quod hic significatur per `desertum Sinai'; quod homo qui regeneratur primum ducatur per verum a Domino, et postea per bonum, videatur n. (x)7923, 
8643, 8648, 8658, 8685, 8690, 8701; per verum ducitur homo qui regeneratur, ob causam ut possit venire ad bonum, hoc est, scire illud, ac dein velle illud, et demum agere illud; sed cum per verum 
ducitur ad bonum, primum venit ad bonum cui nondum {1}vera fidei implantata sunt, nam vera non prius implantari possunt quam cum in bono est; prius quidem sciuntur quia in memoria sunt, sed tunc non 
in bono sunt sed extra bonum; postea cum homo novam vitam {2}accipit, quam tunc primum accipit cum in bono est, tunc {3} implantantur vera fidei, ac in interno homine ineunt cum bono quasi conjugium; 
hoc bonum cui nondum implantata sunt vera fidei, sed usque dispositum ut recipi possint, intelligitur hic per `desertum Sinai.'  {4}Non aliud bonum intelligitur quam bonum Christianum, de quo videatur
