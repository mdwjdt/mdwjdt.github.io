<h3 align="center" class="ired">属天的奥秘 第10060节</h3>
<h4 align="center"></h4><p><strong>10060</strong>.“取点血抹”表天堂里从主的神性良善发出的神性真理。这从“血”的含义清楚可知。当论及祭牲和燔祭时，“血”是指神性真理（参看<a href="10026.htm">10026</a>，<a href="10033.htm">10033</a>节），在此是指在天堂里所转移并接受的从主之神性人身的神性良善发出的神性真理；因为这是接下来所论述的主题。前面（参看<a href="10057.htm">10057</a>节）说明，一个正在重生的人要经历两种状态：第一种是在信之真理正被植入并与仁之良善联结的时候，第二种是在此人处于良善并出于良善行动的时候。在第二种状态下，与他同在的真理从良善发出，因为良善是他看待、谈论并行出真理的角度，或说他出于良善看待、谈论并行出真理。良善存在于每个细节中，正如灵魂在一个人里面，或如同心在身体里面，智慧人从那些处于良善之人的言行中也能察觉到这一点。从对人重生的这个概念能对主之人身的荣耀获得某种概念，因为主照着祂荣耀其人身的的方式而使人重生（<a href="3138.htm">3138</a>，<a href="3212.htm">3212</a>，<a href="3296.htm">3296</a>，<a href="3490.htm">3490</a>，<a href="4402.htm">4402</a>，<a href="5688.htm">5688</a>节）。事实上，其人身荣耀的第一个状态是神性真理的植入，以及它与神性良善的合一。因此，当主在世时，祂将其人身作成神性真理；祂还将它与祂里面的神性良善合一，并由此把它作成神性良善（参看<a href="9199.htm">9199</a>e，<a href="9315.htm">9315</a>e节所提到的地方）。祂荣耀的第二个状态是神性真理从神性良善发出的状态；这真理就是在天堂里的祂的神性。本章10-18节经文关于小公牛的祭牲和第一只公绵羊的燔祭所阐述的事就描述了主之人身的荣耀的第一个状态。但接下来关于被称为“充满手”的第二只公绵羊的阐述则描述了第二个状态。由此明显可知，“血”在此表示在天堂里被转移并接受的从主的神性良善发出的神性真理。</p>

And shalt take of its blood. That this signifies the Divine truth that proceeds from the Lord's Divine good in the heavens, is evident from the signification of "blood," when said of the sacrifice and 
burnt-offering, as being Divine truth (see above, n. 10026, 10033); here the Divine truth that proceeds from the Divine good of the Lord's Divine Human communicated and received in the heavens, for 
this is the subject treated of in what now follows. It was said above (see n. 10057), that there are two states in the man who is being regenerated, the first when truth is being implanted, and this is 
being conjoined with good, the second when the man is in good, and acts from good. When he is in this latter state, then the truths with him proceed from good, for he regards them, speaks them, and 
acts them from good. Then good is in every detail, just as the soul is in man, or as the heart is in the body, which is also perceived by a wise person from the words and acts of those who are in good. 
From this idea of the regeneration of man something can be thought about the glorification of the Lord's Human, for the Lord regenerates man after the manner in which He glorified His Human (n. 3138, 
3212, 3296, 3490, 4402, 5688). For the first state of the glorification of His Human was the implantation of Divine truth, and its unition with Divine good; consequently when the Lord was in the world 
He made His Human Divine truth, and also by unition with the Divine good which was in Him, He made it Divine good (see the places cited in n. 9199, 9315). The second state of His glorification is that 
from the Divine good proceeds the Divine truth, which is His Divine in the heavens. The first state of the glorification of the Lord's Human is described in the internal sense by what is said of the 
sacrifice from the bullock, and the burnt-offering from the first ram, from the tenth to the eighteenth verse of this chapter; but the second state is described by what now follows about the second 
ram, which is called "the ram of fillings." From this it is evident that by "blood" is here signified the Divine truth that proceeds from the Lord's Divine good communicated and received in the heavens. </p>

'And take some of its blood' means Divine Truth emanating from the Lord's Divine Good in the heavens. This is clear from the meaning of 'blood', in reference to a sacrifice or burnt offering, as Divine 
Truth, dealt with above in <a href="10026.htm">10026</a>, <a href="10033.htm">10033</a>, at this point Divine Truth emanating from the Divine Good of the Lord's Divine Human, transmitted and received in the heavens; for this is the subject in what 
immediately follows. It was stated above in <a href="10057.htm">10057</a> that a person who is being regenerated experiences two states, the first being a time when truth is implanted and joined to good, the second when the 
person is governed by good and good is the source of his actions. In this second state the truths present with him emanate from good, for good is the standpoint from which he sees them, speaks of them, 
and acts them out. Good is present in everything at this time, as the soul is within a person, or as the heart is within the body, which one who is wise also discerns in the words and actions of 
those who are governed by good. From this idea of a person's regeneration it is possible to have some conception of the glorification of the Lord's Human; for the way in which the Lord regenerates a person 
is akin to the way in which He glorified His Human, <a href="3138.htm">3138</a>, <a href="3212.htm">3212</a>, <a href="3296.htm">3296</a>, <a href="3490.htm">3490</a>, <a href="4402.htm">4402</a>, <a href="5688.htm">5688</a>. For the first state of glorification of His Human involved the implanting of Divine Truth and uniting of this 
Truth to the Divine Good. While He was in the world therefore the Lord made His Human Divine Truth; He also united it to the Divine Good that was within Him and in so doing made it Divine Good, see 
the places referred to in <a href="9199.htm">9199</a>(end), <a href="9315.htm">9315</a>(end). The second state of His glorification is one in which the Divine Truth emanates from Divine Good; that Truth is His Divinity as this is present in the 
heavens. The first state of the glorification of the Lord's Human is described in the internal sense by the things stated regarding the sacrifice of the young bull and the burnt offering of the first 
ram, dealt with in verses 10-18 of the present chapter. But the second state is described by those that immediately follow regarding the second ram, which is called 'the ram of fillings [of the hand]'. 
From all this it is evident that 'blood' here means Divine Truth emanating from the Lord's Divine Good, transmitted and received in the heavens.  </p>

`Et accipies de sanguine ejus': quod significet Divinum Verum procedens ex Divino Bono Domini in caelis, constat ex significatione `sanguinis' cum de sacrificio et holocausto, quod sit Divinum Verum, 
de qua supra n. 10,026, 10,033, hic Divinum Verum procedens ex Divino Bono Divini Humani Domini, communicatum et receptum in caelis, nam de hoc in nunc sequentibus agitur.  Dictum est supra n. 10,057 
quod bini status sint homini qui regeneratur, primus cum implantatur verum, et hoc conjungitur bono, alter cum (o)homo in bono est, et ex bono agit; cum in hoc statu est, tunc vera apud illum procedunt 
ex bono, nam ex bono spectat illa, {1} loquitur illa, ac agit illa; in singulis tunc est bonum sicut anima in homine, aut sicut cor in corpore, quod etiam a sapiente {2} percipitur ex loquelis et 
ex actibus eorum qui in bono sunt; ex hac idea regenerationis hominis aliquantum cogitari potest de glorificatione Humani Domini, nam Dominus ad instar sicut glorificavit Humanum Suum, etiam regenerat 
hominem, n. (x)3138, 3212, 3296, 3490, 4402, (x)5688; primus enim status glorificationis Humani Ipsius fuit implantatio Divini Veri, ac unitio ejus cum Divino Bono; inde Dominus cum in mundo fuit, Humanum 
Suum fecit Divinum Verum, et quoque per unitionem cum Divino Bono, quod in Ipso, fecit illud Divinum Bonum, videantur citata n. 9199 fin., 9315 fin.; secundus status glorificationis Ipsius est quod 
ex Divino Bono procedat Divinum Verum, quod est Divinum Ipsius in caelis.  Primus status glorificationis Humani Domini describitur in sensu interno per illa quae de sacrificio {3} ex juvenco, et de 
holocausto {4} ex ariete primo, (o)dicta sunt, de quibus in hoc capite vers. 10-18; secundus autem status describitur per illa quae de ariete secundo, (o)qui vocatur aries impletionum, nunc sequuntur. 
 Inde patet quod per `sanguinem' hic significetur Divinum Verum procedens ex Divino Bono Domini, communicatum et receptum in caelis. @1 i et$ @2 After percipitur$ @3 i per repraesentativa sacrificii$ @4 
Holocausti$ </p>
