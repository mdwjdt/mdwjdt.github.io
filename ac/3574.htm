<h3 align="center" class="ired">属天的奥秘 第3574节</h3>
<h4 align="center"></h4><p><strong>3574.</strong>“他就近前亲吻父亲”表在场和联结。这从“近前”和“亲吻”的含义清楚可知：“近前”是指在场；“亲吻”是指出于情感所产生的联结或结合（<a href="3573.htm">3573</a>节）。“亲吻”具有这种含义也可从以下圣言经文明显看出来，如诗篇：<br />当存畏惧事奉耶和华。当亲吻儿子，免得祂发怒，你们就在路上灭亡，因为祂的怒气快要发作。凡投靠他的，都是有福的。（诗篇<a href="http://39-27.cn/诗2.11.htm">2:11</a>-<a href="http://39-27.cn/诗2.12.htm">12</a>）<br />这论述的是主，祂神性人就是“儿子”。“当亲吻儿子”是指要通过爱之信与祂结合。<br />慈爱和诚实彼此相遇；公义和平安彼此相亲。（诗篇<a href="http://39-27.cn/诗85.10.htm">85:10</a>）<br />“公义和平安彼此相亲”表它们结合在一起。何西阿书：<br />以法莲曾说令人战兢的话，因巴力犯罪；现今他们犯罪越来越多，用银子为自己铸像，就是照自己的聪明造偶像，全都是匠人的工作；他们论到这些说，献祭的人可以亲吻牛犊。（何西阿书<a href="http://39-27.cn/何13.1.htm">13:1</a>-<a href="http://39-27.cn/何13.2.htm">2</a>）<br />“以法莲”表聪明，在此表人自己的聪明，也就是那些自以为有智慧并且渴望变得智慧，但不靠着主之人。“用银子铸像”表伪造的良善。“全都是匠人的工作”表自我聪明。经上说那些已然如此的人“亲吻牛犊”，也就是信奉巫术并与其联结。列王纪：<br />耶和华对以利亚说，我在以色列人中留下七千人，都是未曾向巴力屈膝的，未曾与巴力亲嘴的。（列王记上<a href="http://39-27.cn/王上19.18.htm">19:18</a>）<br />“亲嘴”表出于人自己对“巴力”的情感而与他联结，因而表敬拜他。</p>

And he came near, and kissed him. That this signifies presence and unition, is evident from the signification of "coming near," as being presence; and from the signification of "kissing," as being unition 
or conjunction from affection (n. 3573). That "kissing" has this signification is evident also from the following passages in the Word. In David: </p>
<p>     Serve Jehovah with fear. Kiss the Son, lest 
He be angry, and ye perish in the way, for His anger will soon be kindled. Blessed are all they that put their trust in Him (Ps. 2:11-12); </p>
<p>where the Lord is treated of, whose Divine Human is the " 
Son;" to "kiss Him" is to be conjoined with Him through the faith of love. Again: </p>
<p>     Mercy and truth are met together; righteousness and peace have kissed each other (Ps. 85:10); </p>
<p>"righteousness and 
peace have kissed each other" denotes their conjunction together. In Hosea: </p>
<p>     Ephraim spoke horror, and became guilty in Baal; and now they sin more and more and have made them a molten image of 
their silver, even idols in their own intelligence, all of them the work of the craftsmen; they say to them, Let the sacrificers of men kiss the calves (Hos. 13:1-2); </p>
<p>"Ephraim" denotes intelligence, 
here, man's own intelligence, that is, those who believe themselves to be wise, and who desire to be wise, not from the Lord; the "molten image of their silver" denotes good falsified; "all of them the 
work of the craftsmen" denotes self-intelligence. They who are such are said to "kiss the calves," that is, to embrace magic and to adjoin themselves thereto. In the first book of Kings: </p>
<p>     Jehovah 
said to Elijah, I have caused to be left seven thousand in Israel, all the knees that have not bowed unto Baal, and every mouth that hath not kissed him (1 Kings 19:18); </p>
<p>where "to kiss" denotes to 
join one's self from affection, thus to worship. </p>

<p align="center"><b>Elliott(1983-1999) 3574</b></p><p><b>3574.</b>
'And he came near and kissed him' means presence and union. This is clear from the meaning of 'coming near' as presence, and from the meaning of 'kissing' as uniting or joining together resulting from 
affection, <a href="3573.htm">3573</a>. That 'kissing' has this meaning is evident from other places in the Word, as in David, </p>
<blockquote>
Serve Jehovah with fear, and kiss the Son lest He be angry and you perish in the way; for His 
wrath will shortly blaze up. Blessed are all who trust in Him. <a href="http://bible.gospelcom.net/cgi-bin/bible?passage=Ps%202:11,%2012&amp;version=ESV&amp;interface=print&amp;showfn=yes&amp;showxref">Ps 2:11, 12</a>. 
</blockquote>
<p>This refers to the Lord, whose Divine Human is 'the Son'. 'Kissing Him' is being joined to Him by means of faith grounded 
in love. In the same author, </p>
<blockquote>
Let mercy and truth meet, let righteousness and peace kiss each other. <a href="http://bible.gospelcom.net/cgi-bin/bible?passage=Ps%2085:10&amp;version=ESV&amp;interface=print&amp;showfn=yes&amp;showxref">Ps 85:10</a>. 
</blockquote>
<p>'Let righteousness and peace kiss each other' stands for let them join themselves 
to each other. In Hosea, </p>
<blockquote>
Ephraim has uttered what is horrible and has become guilty through Baal. And now they sin more and more; they are making for themselves a molten image from their silver, 
even an idol by their own intelligence, the complete work of craftsman to these saying, Those offering human sacrifice kiss the calves. <a href="http://bible.gospelcom.net/cgi-bin/bible?passage=Hosea%2013:1,%202&amp;version=ESV&amp;interface=print&amp;showfn=yes&amp;showxref">Hosea 13:1, 2</a>. 
</blockquote>
<p></p>
<p><b>[2]</b>
 'Ephraim' stands for intelligence, in this 
case one's own intelligence. That is, 'Ephraim' stands for those who believe and wish to believe that it is not the Lord who is the source of their wisdom. 'A molten image made from their silver' stands 
for good made false. 'The complete work of craftsmen' stands for intelligence that is one's own. Those who are such are said to 'kiss the calves', that is, to embrace magic and ally themselves to 
it. In the first Book of Kings, </p>
<p>Jehovah said to Elijah, I have caused seven thousand to be left over in Israel, all the knees that have not bowed to Baal, and every mouth that has not kissed him. <a href="1.htm">1</a> Kings 19:18. </p>
<p>'Kissing' stands for becoming joined to 'Baal' because of one's affection for him - and so stands for worshipping him. </p>

`Et accessit et osculatus est illum': quod significet praesentiam et unitionem, constat a significatione `accedere' quod sit praesentia, et ex significatione `osculari' quod sit unitio seu conjunctio 
ex affectione {1}, n. (x)3573; quod `osculari' id significet, patet etiam ab (x)aliis locis in Verbo, ut apud Davidem,           Servite Jehovae in timore,...et osculamini Filium, ne      irascatur, 
et pereatis in via, quia exardebit brevi ira      Ipsius, beati omnes confidentes in Ipso, Ps. ii [11,] 12; </p>
<p>ubi de Domino, Cujus Divinum Humanum est `Filius,' `osculari Ipsum' est conjungi Ipsi per 
amoris fidem: apud eundem,           Misericordia et veritas occurrant, justitia et pax      osculentur, Ps. lxxxv 11 [A.V. 10]; </p>
<p>`justitia et pax osculentur' pro conjungant se: apud Hosheam,   
        Locutus est Ephraim horrorem,...et reus factus est in      baale; ...et nunc addunt peccare, faciunt sibi fusile ex      argento suo, in intelligentia sua idola, opus artificum totum,      
illis ipsis dicentes, sacrificantes hominem, vitulos      osculantur, xiii 1, 2; </p>
<p>[2] `Ephraim' pro intelligentia, hic propria, hoc est, {2}pro illis qui' non a Domino sapere se credunt et volunt; `fusile 
ex argento suo' pro bono falsificato'; `opus artificum totum' pro intelligentia propria; qui tales sunt, dicuntur (t)osculari vitulos, hoc est, magiam amplecti et ei se adjungere: in Libro Primo 
Regum,           Jehovah dixit ad Eliam, Superesse feci in Israele septem      millia, omnia genua quae non incurvaverunt se baali, et omne      os quod non osculatum est illum, xix 18; </p>
<p>`osculari' 
pro {3}ex affectione se conjungere, ita colere. @1 i de qua mox supra$  @2 qui ex se$  @3 colere et ex affectione se conjungere$  </p>
