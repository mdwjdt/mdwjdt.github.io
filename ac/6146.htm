<h3 align="center" class="ired">属天的奥秘 第6146节</h3>
<h4 align="center"></h4><p><strong>6146.</strong>“至于百姓，约瑟把他们都迁到城里”表含有真理在里面的记忆知识都被带入与教义事物的联系之中，或说都被归入教义的不同领域。这从“百姓”和“城”的含义清楚可知：“百姓”（即人民）是指真理（参看<a href="1259.htm">1259</a>，<a href="1260.htm">1260</a>，<a href="3295.htm">3295</a>，<a href="3581.htm">3581</a>节），在此是指含有真理在里面的记忆知识，因为他们论及的是埃及的百姓或人民；“城”是指教义事物或领域（<a href="402.htm">402</a>，<a href="2449.htm">2449</a>，<a href="3216.htm">3216</a>，<a href="4492.htm">4492</a>，<a href="4493.htm">4493</a>节）。因此，“把百姓都迁到城里”是指将含有真理在里面的记忆知识都被带入与教义事物的联系之中，或说都被归入教义的不同领域。这一点从前文可推知，即从这段描述可推知：真理被带入与属世层里面的总体之物的联系之中（<a href="6115.htm">6115</a>节）。因为教义事物是总的整体，真理被带入与它的联系之中。教会的教义被分成了它的各个类别，每个类别都形成教会的一个总的整体。由此也可以看出，约瑟将百姓迁到城里，是为了代表真理与总的整体，因而与教义的不同领域，或说教义事物的联系。</p>

<p align="center"><b>Potts(1905-1910) 6146</b></p><p><b>6146.</b>
And as for the people, he removed it to the cities. That this signifies that the truths of memory-knowledge were brought into relation to doctrinal things, is evident from the signification of the "people," 
as being truths (see n. 1259, 1260, 3295, 3581), here truths of memory-knowledge because they are predicated of the people of Egypt; and from the signification of "cities," as being doctrinal 
things (n. 402, 2449, 3216, 4492, 4493). Therefore "to remove the people to the cities," is to bring the truths of memory-knowledge into relation to doctrinal things. This follows from what goes before, 
namely, from this, that truths were brought into relation to what is general in the natural (n. 6115); for doctrinal things are the generals to which truths are brought into relation; because the doctrine 
of the church is divided into its heads, and each head is a general of the church. For this reason also the people was removed to the cities by Joseph, that thereby might be represented the relation 
of truths to generals, thus to doctrinal things. </p>

<p align="center"><b>Elliott(1983-1999) 6146</b></p><p><b>6146.</b>
'And the people, he transferred them to the cities' means that facts holding truths within them were assigned to different areas of doctrine. This is clear from the meaning of 'the people' as truths, 
dealt with in <a href="1259.htm">1259</a>, <a href="1160.htm">1160</a>, <a href="3295.htm">3295</a>, <a href="3581.htm">3581</a>, at this point facts holding truths within them since the people of Egypt are referred to; and from the meaning of 'the cities' as areas of doctrine, dealt with in <a href="402.htm">402</a>, <a href="2449.htm">2449</a>, <a href="3216.htm">3216</a>, <a href="4492.htm">4492</a>, <a href="4497.htm">4497</a>. Consequently 'transferring the people to the cities' means assigning facts that hold truths within them to different areas of doctrine. This follows from what has gone before 
- from the description that truths were assigned to a general whole within the natural, <a href="6715.htm">6715</a>. For matters of doctrine are general wholes to which truths are assigned. The teaching of the Church 
divides up under its own headings, and each heading forms a general whole in the Church. From this one may also see that the transfer of the people by Joseph to the cities was carried out so that the 
relating of truths to general wholes, and so to different areas of doctrine, might be represented. </p>

</p><b>6146.</b>
`Et populum transtulit illum ad urbes':  quod significet quod vera scientifica (x)referrentur ad doctrinalia, constat a significatione  `populi' quod sint vera, de qua n. 1259, 1260, 3295, 3581, hic 
vera scientifica quia praedicantur de populo Aegypti; et ex significatione `urbium' quod sint doctrinalia, de qua n. 402, (x)2449,3216,4492,4493; inde nunc `populum transferre ad urbes' est vera scientifica 
referre ad doctrinalia; haec sequuntur ab illis quae praecedunt, nempe ab illis, quod vera relata sint ad commune in naturali, n. 6115; doctrinalia enim sunt communia ad quae referuntur vera; 
doctrina enim Ecclesiae partita est in sua capita, et quodlibet caput est commune Ecclesiae; inde etiam `populus translatus est ad urbes a Josepho' ut per id repraesentaretur relatio verorum ad communia, 
ita ad doctrinalia.   </p>
