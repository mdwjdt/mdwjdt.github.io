<h3 align="center" class="ired">属天的奥秘 第2744节</h3>
<h4 align="center"></h4><p><strong>2744.</strong>我被指示来自婚姻之爱的快乐如何向两边，即天堂与地狱发展。朝向天堂的快乐逐渐发展，进入不断增长的幸福快乐中，甚至到了无法数算或描述的程度，并且越向内发展，就越多得数不清，越无法形容，直到至内在天堂，就是纯真天堂的属天幸福本身。所有这一切都需要最大的自由，因为一切自由皆来自爱；因此，最大的自由来自婚姻之爱，并且是天上的自由本身。那时，我被指示婚姻之爱的快乐如何向地狱发展。它们一点点地远离天堂，这也需要表面的自由，直到最后几乎没有任何人性之物存留其中。我看到了它们最终致命的、地狱般的结局，却无法描述出来。当时，有一个灵人与我同在，也看到了这些事。他匆忙向一些具有这种秉性的塞壬走去，声称他会向她们展示其快乐的性质。起初，他具有快乐的观念，但随着他一点点往前走，他的观念就像这快乐一样向着地狱发展，最终落了个如此恐怖的下场。塞壬就是具有这种信念的女人，即行淫通奸是很光彩的，她们还因为乐意这样并过着表面得体的生活而受到别人的尊敬。有关她们的论述，可参看前文（<a href="831.htm">831</a>，<a href="959.htm">959</a>，<a href="1515.htm">1515</a>，<a href="1983.htm">1983</a>，<a href="2483.htm">2483</a>节）。</p>

It was shown me how the delights from conjugial love advance, on the one side to heaven, and on the other to hell. The advancement of the delights toward heaven was into blessedness and happiness continually 
more and more, even to what was beyond number or description; and the more interior, the more innumerable and ineffable, even to the very celestial happiness of the inmost heaven, or of the heaven 
of innocence; and this with the greatest freedom, for all freedom is from love; and thus the greatest freedom is from conjugial love, and is heavenly freedom itself. It was then shown how the delights 
of conjugial love descend toward hell-that they remove themselves little by little away from heaven, and this likewise with apparent freedom, till at last scarcely anything human remains in them. 
The deadly and infernal end to which they come has been seen, but cannot be described. A certain spirit who was then with me, and likewise saw these things, ran hastily forward to some sirens, of this 
character, declaring that he would show them the quality of their delight, and at first having the idea of delight; but as by little and little he came more in front, his idea was continued on, like 
the progress of the delight, to hell; and at length it ended in such horror. Sirens are women who have been in the persuasion that it is honorable to commit whoredom and adultery, and have also been 
valued by others for being so disposed, and for being in the elegancies of life. Most of them come into the other life from Christendom. They are treated of above (n. 831, 959, 1515, 1983, 2483). </p>

I have been shown the way in which the delights from conjugial love advance on one side towards heaven and on the other towards hell. The advancement of delights towards heaven was an advancement into 
forms of blessedness and happiness constantly increasing, until they were beyond number or description. And the more interiorly they advanced the more countless and indescribable they became, even to 
the celestial forms themselves of blessedness and happiness of the inmost heaven, which is the heaven of innocence. And all this entails perfect freedom, for all freedom is attributable to love, so 
that perfect freedom is attributable to conjugial love, which is heavenly love itself. I was then shown the way in which the delights of conjugial love advance towards hell; that they move away from heaven 
little by little, which too entails apparent freedom, until scarcely anything human at all remains in them. The final deadly and hellish condition into which they ended was seen by me but I cannot 
describe it. A certain spirit who was with me at the time and who also saw those things hurried forwards to some sirens who were of this character, crying out that he would show them the nature of 
their delight. At first he had the idea of delight, but as little by little he went forwards his idea was made to continue, like the advancement of the delight, towards hell, and at length to end in such 
horror. Sirens are women who labour under the delusion that it is perfectly correct to commit whoredom and adultery, and who are also esteemed by others for being such as they are and for leading 
outwardly respectable lives. The majority of them come into the next life from Christendom. See what is said about them in <a href="831.htm">831</a>, <a href="959.htm">959</a>, <a href="1515.htm">1515</a>, <a href="1983.htm">1983</a>, <a href="2483.htm">2483</a>. </p>

</p><b>2744.</b>
Ostensum mihi quomodo progrediuntur jucunda ab amore conjugiali, hinc ad caelum, illinc ad infernum; progressio jucundorum versus caelum erat in beatitudines et felicitates continue plures, usque ad 
innumerabiles et ineffabiles, et quo interius in innumerabiliores et ineffabiliores, usque ad ipsas caelestes caeli intimi seu innocentiae; et hoc per liberrimum, omne enim liberum est ex amore, ita liberrimum 
ex amore conjugiali qui est ipse caelestis. Ostensum dein quomodo progrediuntur jucunda amoris conjugialis versus infernum, quod se paullatim removeant a caelo, et hoc quoque ex apparente libero, 
usque dum iis vix aliquid humani remanet; mortiferum et infernale in quod desinunt, quod visum, non describi potest. Quidam spiritus qui tunc apud me, et illa quoque vidit, festinabat antrorsum 
ad sirenes quae tales, clamans quod ostenderet iis quale eorum jucundum, tenens primum ideam jucundi, sed cum paullatim magis antrorsum venit, continuabatur idea, sicut jucundi progressio, ad infernum, 
et tandem desiit in talem horrorem.  Sirenes sunt quae in persuasione quod honestum sit scortari et adulterari, etiam aestimatae ab aliis quod tales, et quod in decoris vitae; earum plurima pars in 
alteram vitam e Christianismo veniunt; de illis videatur n. 831, 959, 1515, 1893, (x)2483. </p>
