<h3 align="center" class="ired">属天的奥秘 第2457节</h3>
<h4 align="center"></h4><p><strong>2457.</strong>没有必要详细解释这些事，因为它们大部分在前一章，以及再之前的章节予以解释了。此处补充并穿插这些章节，是为了让人们清楚知道，善人与恶人分开，善人得救，恶人被定罪，这一切唯独通过主的神性本质与其人性本质的合一而实现。否则，此处罗得所代表的所有这些人连同剩下的人必早已灭亡。这就是以下这些话所表示的：“当神毁灭平原诸城的时候，神记念亚伯拉罕，正在倾覆罗得所住那城的时候，就打发罗得从倾覆当中出来”。就内义而言，它们表示通过主的神性本质与其人性本质的合一，处于良善的所有人都得救了，此处罗得所代表的那些处于具有良善的真理之人也得救了。而那些处于源自邪恶的虚假之人则灭亡了，即便那些得救的人也处于虚假与邪恶。这些章节以这种方式将出现在本章的事与前一章所发生的事联结起来；也就是说，亚伯拉罕（即处于这种状态的主）为那些由“五十”、“四十五”、“四十”、“三十”、“二十”和“十”所表示的所多玛和蛾摩拉人代求。如前一章所解释的，它们依次表示处于良善的所有人，以及那些处于具有某种良善之物的真理之人。</p>

It is not necessary to explain these things in detail, because for the most part they have been explained in the preceding chapter, and also previously to that. They have been here added and inserted 
to the end that it might be evident that the good were separated from the evil, the former being saved while the latter were condemned, solely through the unition of the Lord's Divine Essence with His 
Human Essence; for if this had not taken place all those who are here represented by Lot would have perished together with the rest; which is meant by these words: "And it came to pass when God destroyed 
the cities of the plain, that God remembered Abraham, and sent Lot out of the midst of the overthrow, when He overthrew the cities in which Lot dwelt;" which in the internal sense denote that through 
the unition of the Lord's Divine Essence with His Human Essence, all who were in good were saved, and also those who were in truth in which there is good, here represented by Lot, while those who 
were in falsities from evils perished, although they who were saved were also in falsities and evils. In this way therefore are the things said in this chapter conjoined with those said in the preceding 
one; namely, that Abraham (that is, the Lord in that state) interceded for those people of Sodom and Gomorrah who are signified by the "fifty," the "forty-five," the "forty," the "thirty," the "twenty," 
and the "ten;" concerning whom it was there explained that these are all in their order who are in good, and also those who are in truth in which there is anything of good. </p>

There is no need to provide a detailed explanation of these verses since this has been provided for the most part in the previous chapter, and before that. These verses have been added and inserted here 
so as to make it quite clear that the separation of the good from the evil, and the salvation of the good but condemnation of the evil, was achieved solely through the Lord's Divine Essence united 
to His Human Essence. Otherwise all those people represented here by Lot would also have perished along with the rest. This is what the following words are used to mean, 'When God was destroying the 
cities of the plain, God remembered Abraham, and sent Lot away out of the midst of the overthrowing when He was overthrowing the cities in which Lot dwelt'. In the internal sense this means that all those 
governed by good were saved through the Lord's Divine Essence united to His Human Essence, as also were those governed by truth that had good within it, who are represented here by 'Lot', while those 
governed by falsities derived from evils perished, even though those who were saved were also governed by such falsities and evils. In this way these verses link together the things that occur in 
this chapter with those in the previous chapter; that is to say, 'Abraham', that is, the Lord during that state, made intercession on behalf of the people of Sodom and Gomorrah who are meant by 'the 
fifty', 'the forty-five', 'the forty', 'the thirty', 'the twenty', and 'the ten', who, as was explained in the previous chapter, mean all in their order who are governed by good, as well as those governed 
by truth in which there is some measure of good. </p>

Singula haec explicare non opus est, quia quoad maximam partem in capite praecedente, et prius, explicata sunt: haec addita et interjecta sunt ob finem ut constaret quod separati sint boni a malis, 
ac illi salvati, hi autem damnati, unice per unitionem Essentiae Divinae Domini cum Humana Ipsius; alioquin omnes illi qui per `Lotum' hic repraesentantur, etiam una periissent; quod intelligitur per 
haec verba, `Fuit in perdendo Deus urbes planitiei, et recordatus est Deus Abrahami, et emisit Lotum e medio eversionis, in evertendo urbes, in quibus habitavit Lot,' quod est in sensu interno quod salvati 
sint per unitionem Essentiae Divinae Domini cum Humana Ipsius omnes qui in bono, ut et qui in vero in quo bonum, hic repraesentati per `Lotum,' cum perirent illi qui in falsis a malis, tametsi illi 
qui salvati sunt, etiam in falsis et malis essent.  Ita nunc conjuncta sunt haec quae in hoc capite, cum illis quae in praecedente, nempe quod `Abrahamus,' hoc est, Dominus in illo statu, intercesserit 
pro illis Sodomae et Amorae, qui significantur per `quinquaginta,' per `quadraginta quinque,' per `quadraginta,' per `triginta,' per `viginti' et per `decem,' qui quod sint omnes illi in suo ordine 
qui in bono sunt, tum qui in vero in quo aliquid boni, ibi explicatum est. </p>
