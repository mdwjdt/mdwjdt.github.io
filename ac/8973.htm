Verses 2-6. When thou shalt buy a Hebrew servant, six years he shall serve; and in the seventh year he shall go out free for nothing. If in his body he shall come in, in his body he shall go out; if 
he is master of a woman, then his woman shall go out with him. If his master shall give him a woman, and she shall bear him sons or daughters, the woman and her children shall be his master's, and he 
shall go out in his body. And if saying the servant shall say, I love my master, my woman, and my children; I will not go out free; then his master shall bring him unto God, and shall bring him unto the 
door, or unto the door-post; and his master shall bore through his ear with his awl; and he shall serve him forever. "When thou shalt buy a Hebrew servant," signifies those within the church who are 
in the truths of doctrine and not in good according to them; "six years he shall serve," signifies a state of labor and of some combat and of the consequent confirmation of truth; "and in the seventh 
year he shall go out free for nothing," signifies a state of truth confirmed without exertion on his part; "if in his body he shall come in," signifies truth without delight; "in his body he shall 
go out," signifies a state of truth without delight also after combat; "if he is master of a woman," signifies truth with delight adjoined; "then his woman shall go out with him," signifies a state of 
truth with delight conjoined also after combat; "if his master shall give him a woman," signifies good from the spiritual adjoined to truth while in combat; "and she bear him sons or daughters," signifies 
the truths and goods thence derived; "the woman and her children shall be his master's," signifies that good adjoined to truth by the spiritual, together with the goods and truths thence derived, 
shall not be appropriated to truth; "and he shall go out in his body," signifies the state after combat, which is merely one of confirmed and implanted truth; "and if saying the servant shall say," 
signifies thought then from the implanted truth; "I love my master, my woman, and my children," signifies the delight of the remembrance of spiritual goods; "I will not go out free," signifies the delight 
of obedience; "then his master shall bring him unto God," signifies a state into which he then enters according to Divine order; "and shall bring him to the door, or unto the door-post," signifies 
a state of communication of truth confirmed and implanted with spiritual good; "and his master shall bore through his ear with his awl," signifies a representative of obedience; "and he shall serve 
him forever," signifies to eternity. </p>

Verses 2-6 When you buy a Hebrew slave, he shall serve for six years; and in the seventh he shall go out free, for nothing. If he comes in his body, he shall go out in his body;<A name="fntext1"></a><A href="#fn1"><sup>a</sup></a> if he is master of a 
woman,<A name="fntext2"></a><A href="#fn2"><sup>b</sup></a> his woman shall go out with him. If his master has given him a woman and she has borne him sons or daughters, the woman and her children shall be her master's, and he shall go out in his body<A name="fntext3"></a><A href="#fn3"><sup>c</sup></a>. 
And if the slave says plainly, I love my master, my woman, and my children, I will not go out free; his master shall bring him to God, and shall bring him to the door or to the doorpost. And his 
master shall pierce his ear with an awl; and he shall serve him forever. </p>
<p>'When you buy a Hebrew slave' means those within the Church who are imbued with the truths of religious teachings and not with 
the good that accords with those truths. 'He shall serve for six years' means a state of labour and some conflict, and of consequent strengthening of truth 'And in the seventh he shall go out free, 
for nothing' means a state of strengthened truth without its works. 'If he comes in his body' means truth without delight. 'He shall go out in his body' means a state of truth without delight, also 
after conflict. 'If he is master of a woman' means truth together with delight linked to it. 'His woman shall go out with him' means a state of truth together with delight joined to it, also after conflict. 
'If his master has given him a woman' means good attached by the spiritual to truth during conflict. 'And she has borne him sons or daughters' means truths and forms of good which are derived from 
that good. 'The woman and her children shall be her master's' means that the good attached by the spiritual to truth, and the forms of good and the truths derived from that good, must not be assigned 
to truth as its own. 'And he shall go out in his body' means a state after conflict, which is solely one of strengthened and implanted truth. 'And if the slave says plainly' means thought then springing 
from the implanted truth. 'I love my master, my woman, and my children' means the delight in remembering forms of spiritual good. 'I will not go out free' means the delight of obedience. 'His master 
shall bring him to God' means the state he then enters in keeping with Divine order. 'And shall bring him to the door or to the doorpost' means a state in which strengthened and implanted truth 
communicates with spiritual good. 'And his master shall pierce his ear with an awl' means a representative sign of obedience. 'And he shall serve him forever' means into eternity.

{1}  Vers. 2-6.  Cum emeris servum Hebraeum, sex annis serviet, et in septimo exibit ad liberum gratis.  Si in corpore suo venerit, in corpore suo exibit; si (x)dominus mulieris ille, et exibit mulier 
illius cum illo.  Si (x)dominus ejus dederit ei mulierem, et pepererit ei filios aut filias, mulier et nati hujus erit domino ejus, et ille exibit in corpore suo.  Et si dicendo dixerit servus, Diligo 
dominum meum, mulierem meam, et liberos meos, non exibo liber. Et adducet illum dominus ejus ad Deum, et adducet illum ad januam vel ad postem, et perforabit dominus ejus aurem ejus subula, et serviet 
illi in perpetuum.  `Cum emeris servum Hebraeum' significat illos intra Ecclesiam qui in veris doctrinae et non in bono secundum illa: `sex annis serviet' significat statum laboris et alicujus pugnae, 
et inde {2}confirmationis veri: `et in septimo exibit ad liberum gratis' significat statum confirmati veri absque ejus opera: `si in corpore suo venerit' significat verum absque jucundo: `in corpore 
suo exibit' significat statum veri absque jucundo etiam post pugnam: `si dominus mulieris ille' significat verum cum adjuncto jucundo: `et exibit mulier illius cum illo' significat statum veri cum 
jucundo conjuncto etiam post pugnam: `si dominus ejus dederit ei mulierem' significat a spirituali adjunctum bonum vero cum in pugna: `et pepererit ei filios aut filias' significat inde vera et bona derivata: 
mulier et nati hujus erit domino ejus' significat quod bonum vero a spirituali adjunctum cum bonis et veris inde derivatis non vero erit appropriatum: `et ille exibit in corpore suo' significat 
statum post pugnam, qui est solum confirmati et implantati veri: `et si dicendo dixerit servus' significat cogitationem tunc ex vero implantato: `Diligo dominum meum, mulierem meam, et liberos meos' 
significat jucundum recordationis bonorum spiritualium: non exibo liber' significat jucundum oboedientiae: `et adducet illum dominus ejus ad Deum' significat statum in quem tunc intrat secundum ordinem 
Divinum: `et adducet illum ad januam vel ad postem' significat statum communicationis veri confirmati et implantati cum bono spirituali: `et perforabit (x)dominus' ejus aurem ejus subula' significat 
repraesentativum oboedientiae: `et serviet illi in perpetuum significat in aeternum. @1 See p. 312, note 6. P1 here reads: 3. Si in corpore suo venerit, significat naturalem hominem in simplici vero 
absque bono ante statum initiationis: in corpore suo exibit significat libertatem in eo statu: si dominus mulieris ille, significat cum bono: et exibit mulier illius cum illo, significat libertatem 
in tali statu.  [Ecclesiae externae homo is written in m.] 4. Si dominus ejus dederit ei mulierem, significat spirituale bonum vero adjunctum: et pepererit ei filios aut filias, significat et si inde 
vera et bona: mulier et nati hujus erit domino ejus, significat bonum inde spirituale, et quoque vera et bona ex conjugio illo derivata: et ille exibit in corpore, significat verum in statu libertatis 
inde ... 5. Et si dicendo dixerit servus, sign ... agitur de illis qui in Ecclesia spirituali qui faciunt verum fidei essentiale salutis, et non bonum charitatis, seu bonum voluntatis, quod est bonum 
vitae: hi sunt servi Hebraei emti a dominis ibi; domini sunt qui in affectione ver et boni sunt, qui vere spirituales homines dicendi. 	P2 reads: 2. Cum emeris servum Hebraeum, significat illa quae 
in homine naturali, quae inservitura sunt illis qui in spirituali: sex annis serviet, significat status laboris et tentationis, et inde applicationis: et in septimo exibit ad liberum gratis, significat 
statum conjunctionis, qui est cum ex bono ducitur. 3. Si in corpore suo venerit, significat scientifica vera quae in naturali homine ante statum initiationis: in corpore suo exibit, significat quod 
post conjunctionem mansurum sit in naturali: si dominus mulieris ille, significat jucundum boni adjunctum: et exibit mulier illius cum illo, significat quod etiam id permansurum in naturali. 4. Si dominus 
ejus dederit ei mulierem, significat si spiritualis homo adjunxerit vero scientifico jucundum boni: et pepererit ei filios aut filias, significat si ex conjugio illo derivata sint vera et bona: mulier 
et nati hujus erit domino ejus, significat quod illa quae a spirituali homine provenerint, illius erunt: et ille exibit in corpore, significat quod reliqua erunt hominis naturalis. 5. Et si dicendo 
dixerit servus, significat apperceptionem naturalis: diligo dominum meum, significat jucundum serviendi spirituali: mulierem meam, et liberos meos, significat jucundum conjunctionis cum conjunctis 
sibi, et inde derivatis in naturali: non exibo liber, significat quod non velit spiritualis fieri. 6. Et adducet illum dominus ejus ad deum, significat quod spirituale id manifestabit coram divino: et 
adducet illum ad januam, seu ad postem, significat ad locum conjunctionis spiritualis et naturalis quoad verum vel quoad bonum: et perforabit dominus ejus aurem ejus subula, significat repraesentativum 
servitatis: et serviet illi in perpetuum, significat in aeternum.$ @2 confirmationes IT$ </p>
