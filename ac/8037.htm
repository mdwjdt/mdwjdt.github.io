<h4 align="center"></h4><p><strong>8037.</strong>那些以爱自己爱世界为目的的人根本不可能拥有任何仁或信在里面。陷入这些爱的人甚至不知道何为仁，何为信，根本不明白，向邻舍意愿良善却不带有任何回报的想法就拥有天堂在自己里面，这种情感所带来的幸福和天使所享受的一样大，这种幸福是难以形容的。因为这些人认为，如果他们被剥夺了从担任要职和拥有财富的荣耀所获得的喜乐，一切喜乐都不复存在。然而这时，无限超越其它一切喜乐的天上喜乐才刚刚开始。</p>

They who have the love of self or the love of the world as the end in view, cannot possibly be in charity and faith. They who are in these loves do not even know what charity is, and what faith is, and 
do not at all comprehend that to will good to the neighbor without any reward is heaven in man, and that in this affection there is happiness as great as is that of the angels, which is unutterable; 
for they believe that if they are deprived of the joy arising from the glory of honors and of wealth all joy ceases to be possible; when yet heavenly joy, which infinitely transcends every other joy, 
then first begins.            EXODUS 13 </p>
<p>     1. And Jehovah spake unto Moses, saying,       2. Sanctify to Me all the firstborn, that which openeth every womb among the sons of Israel, in man 
and in beast; it is Mine.      3. And Moses said unto the people, Remember thou this day, in which ye went out from Egypt, out of the house of servants; because in strength of hand Jehovah led you forth 
from hence; and what is leavened shall not be eaten.      4. This day ye go forth, in the month Abib.      5. And it shall be when Jehovah shall have brought thee unto the land of the Canaanite, 
and the Hittite, and the Amorite, and the Hivite, and the Jebusite, which He sware to thy fathers to give thee, a land flowing with milk and honey, that thou shalt serve this service in this month.  
    6. Seven days thou shalt eat unleavened things, and in the seventh day is a feast to Jehovah.      7. Unleavened things shall be eaten seven days; and that which is leavened shall not be seen with 
thee, leaven shall not be seen with thee in all thy border.      8. And thou shalt tell thy son in that day, saying, It is because of that which Jehovah did for me, in my going forth out of Egypt.  
    9. And it shall be for a sign unto thee upon thine hand, and for a memorial between thine eyes, that the law of Jehovah may be in thy mouth; because with a strong hand hath Jehovah led thee forth 
out of Egypt.      10. And thou shalt keep this statute at the set time from year to year.      11. And it shall be when Jehovah shall have brought thee in to the land of the Canaanite, as He sware 
to thee and to thy fathers, and shall have given it thee: </p>
<p>     12. That thou shalt cause to pass over to Jehovah all that openeth the womb; and all that openeth of the offspring of a beast, which 
shall be to thee males, shall be for Jehovah.      13. And all that openeth of an ass thou shalt redeem with one of the flock; and if thou wilt not redeem it, then thou shalt break its neck; and every 
firstborn of man among thy sons shalt thou redeem.      14. And it shall be when thy son shall ask thee tomorrow, saying, What is this? that thou shalt say unto him, In strength of hand Jehovah led 
us forth from Egypt, from the house of servants.      15. And it was that Pharaoh hardened himself against letting us go, and Jehovah slew all the firstborn in the land of Egypt, from the firstborn 
of man and even to the firstborn of beast; therefore I sacrifice to Jehovah all that openeth the womb, being males; and all the firstborn of my sons I redeem.      16. And it shall be for a sign upon 
thine hand, and for frontlets between thine eyes; because in strength of hand Jehovah led us forth out of Egypt.      17. And it was in Pharaoh's letting the people go, that God led them not by the 
way of the land of the Philistines, because that was near; for God said, Perchance the people will repent when they see war, and will return to Egypt.      18. And God led the people about, by the way 
of the wilderness, the sea Suph; and the sons of Israel went up armed out of the land of Egypt.      19. And Moses took the bones of Joseph with him; for swearing he had caused the sons of Israel to 
swear, saying, Visiting God will visit you; and ye shall bring up my bones with you from hence.      20. And they journeyed from Succoth, and encamped in Etham, at the end of the wilderness.      
21. And Jehovah went before them by day in a pillar of cloud, to lead them in the way; and by night in a pillar of fire, to give them light; to go by day and by night.      22. The pillar of cloud by 
day, and the pillar of fire by night, departed not from before the people. </p>

Those who have self-love and love of the world as their end in view cannot have any charity or faith at all within them. People ruled by those loves do not even know what charity is or what faith is; 
they do not begin to understand that when a person desires his neighbour's good without thought of reward he has heaven within himself, or that this affection brings happiness as great as that enjoyed 
by the angels, which is indescribable. For those people think that if they are deprived of the joy received from the glory of holding important positions and possessing wealth, no joy at all exists 
any longer. But that is just when heavenly joy begins; and this joy is infinitely superior. </p>

Qui amorem sui aut amorem mundi pro fine habent nequaquam possunt in charitate et fide esse; qui in illis amoribus sunt ne quidem sciunt quid charitas et quid fides, et prorsus non comprehendunt quod 
velle bonum proximo absque remuneratione sit caelum in homine, et quod illi affectioni insit tanta felicitas quanta est angelorum, quae ineffabilis; nam credunt, si privantur gaudio ex gloria honorum 
ac opum, quod nihil gaudii amplius detur, cum tamen tunc primum incohat gaudium caeleste, quod infinite transcendit. 	{1} 	@1 A i the following notes, the substance of which relates to transactions 
at the beginning of succeeding chapters: </p>
<p>	Proxime quod faciat bonum propter bonum, et justum propter justum, 	quod quisque in charitate sit, qui officio suo rite fungitur, 	quod hoc cuivis notum

 Sanctifica Mihi omne primogenitum, aperturam omnis uteri, in filiis Israelis, in homine et in bestia; Mihi illud. 	3.  Et dixit Moscheh ad populum, Memento diei hujus quo exivistis ex Aegypto, e domo 
servorum, quia in robore manus eduxit JEHOVAH vos exhinc; et non comedetur fermentatum. 	4.  Hodie vos exitis, in mense Abib. 	5.  Et erit, cum introduxerit te JEHOVAH ad terram Cananaei, et Chittaei, 
et Emorraei, et Chivaei, et Jebusaei, quam juravit patribus tuis ad dandum tibi, terram fluentem lacte et melle, et servies servitium hoc in mense hoc. 	6.  Septem diebus comedes azyma, et in die 
septimo festum JEHOVAE. 	7.  Azyma comedetur septem diebus, et non videbitur tibi fermentatum, et non videbitur tibi fermentum in omni termino tuo. 	8.  Et indicabis filio tuo in die isto, dicendo, 
Propter hoc fecit JEHOVAH mihi in exire me ex Aegypto. 	9.  Et erit tibi in signum super manu tua, et in memoriale inter oculos tuos, propterea ut sit lex JEHOVAE in ore tuo, quia manu robusta eduxit 
te JEHOVAH ex Aegypto. 	10.  Et custodies statutum hoc ad statum tempus, ab anno n annum. 	11.  Et erit cum introduxerit te JEHOVAH ad terram Cananaei, quemadmodum juravit tibi et patribus tuis, 
et dederit illam tibi. 	12.  Et transire facies omnem aperturam uteri JEHOVAE, et omnem aperturam fetus bestiae, qui erit tibi masculi, JEHOVAE. 	13.  Et omnem aperturam asini redimes in pecude, et 
si non redimis, et decollabis illud; et omnem primogenitum hominis in filiis tuis redimes. 	14.  Et erit quod interroget te filius tuus cras, dicendo, Quid hoc? et dicas ad illum, In robore manus eduxit 
nos JEHOVAH ex Aegypto, e domo servorum. 	15.  Et erat quod induraverit Pharao ad dimittendum nos, et interfecit JEHOVAH omne primogenitum in terra Aegypti, a (x)primogenito hominis et usque ad primogenitum 
bestiae, propterea ego sacrifico JEHOVAE omnem aperturam uteri, masculos, et omnem primogenitum filiorum meorum redimo. 	16.  Et erit in signum super manu tua, et ad frontalia inter oculos 
tuos, quia in robore manus eduxit nos JEHOVAH ex Aegypto. 	17.  Et fuit in dimittere Pharao populum, et non duxit illos DEUS via terrae Philistaeorum, quia propinqua illa, quia dixit DEUS, Forte paenitebit 
populum in videre illos bellum, et revertentur Aegyptum. 	18.  Et circumduxit DEUS populum via deserti, mare Suph; et accincti ascenderunt filii Israelis e terra Aegypti. 	19.  Et accepit Moscheh 
ossa Josephi secum, quia adjurando adjuravit filios Israelis, dicendo, Visitando visitabit DEUS vos, et ascendere facietis ossa mea exhinc vobiscum. 	20.  Et profecti e Succoth, et castrametati 
in Etham, in fine deserti. 	21.  Et JEHOVAH ibat ante illos interdiu in columna nubis, ad ducendum illos via, et noctu in columna ignis ad illuminandum illos, ad eundum diu et noctu. 	22.  Non recedebat 
columna nubis interdiu, et columna ignis noctu, ante populum. </p>
