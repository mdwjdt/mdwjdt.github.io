<h3 align="center" class="ired">属天的奥秘 第1763节</h3>
<h4 align="center"></h4><p><strong>1763.</strong>我还听过很多灵人一起说话的同步言语形式。它象波浪一样咆哮，从各个方向流入大脑。此外，有些灵人的言语形式就是四重奏，好象人们脱口而出的噪音和声音。这些灵人与其他灵人隔离。他们会在头部引发仿佛气泵抽吸造成的疼痛。我听见有些灵人说话时嗓音洪亮，然而似乎是内在的，在他们自己里面。不过，它们仍作为言语传到我的听觉。<br />有些灵人说话时就象是从肚子里啐出话来。这些灵人就是诸如不愿注意事物的意义，而是被迫通过别人说话的那类灵人。我听见有些灵人说话时带有粗鲁或破裂声。他们会来到我左肘下，也会到我的左耳。我也听见有些灵人说话声音不大，甚至听不见，好象患了重感冒。他们属于那些为伤害他人而偷偷潜入他人的快乐，窃取他们秘密的人。<br />有些灵人身体矮小，尽管为数不多，但说起话来就象一大群人，听上去如雷鸣一般。我曾听见他们在头顶上，还以为那里有很多人。但其中一个人从那里来到我左胳膊下面，以那种雷鸣般的声音说话，他还挪到别处这样说话。蒙主怜悯，我会在别处告知这类灵人来自何处。不过，这几种言语十分罕见。值得注意的是，对于内在听觉器官被打开的人和灵人而言，无论以哪种方式所说的话，在他们听来大声响亮，如同世人的声音和言语。但那些内在听觉器官未打开的人则根本听不见。</p>

<p><strong>[NCE]1763.</strong> I also heard a large group of spirits speaking all together. Their speech rose and fell like a wave, flowing into various destinations in my brain.<br />Again, I listened to certain spirits using speech that had a fourfold ending, duplicating the pitch and sound of threshers.{*1} These spirits are separate from others, since they cause the kind of headache that suction through a syringe would cause.<br />I heard some who seemed to be talking to themselves but in an audible voice, so that their words reached my ears.<br />[2] Still others talked by belching the words up out of their stomach. They are the kind who have no interest in the meaning of a thing but are enlisted by others to speak.{*2} I have heard spirits who spoke hoarsely, their voices cracking. They attach themselves to my left side under my elbow and also to my left ear.{*3} Then there were those who had lost their voice, like a person with a cold. Some of them are the type that draw out others' secrets in order to hurt them by injecting [something contradictory] into their pleasure.<br />[3] There are small spirits who are few in number but still talk as if they were a huge crowd. They seem to thunder. I heard them above my head and assumed they were a large throng, but then one individual approached me on my left side below my arm and spoke in similarly thunderous tones. He did the same thing again from further away. Where they come from will be told elsewhere, the Lord in his divine mercy willing.{*4} These types of speech are relatively unusual, however.<br />For one whose inner ear is open, and for spirits, these sounds and types of speech are as loud and clear as those of a person on earth, surprising to say. For one whose inner ear is not open, they are inaudible.<br /><br /><strong>Footnotes:</strong><br />{*1} The exact reference to "the pitch and sound of threshers" cannot be recovered, but this account of threshing practices in medieval England seems relevant: "Small quantities [of wheat] might be threshed by one or two men, but a team of threshers might contain as many as eight or ten. The action was a swinging stroke that made the ‘sweple,' or loose end of the flail, swing around behind the head and brought the head of the staff down to the floor at the end of the stroke... . To prevent broken heads, the sweples had to be swept round in perfect time, and in perfect rhythm, rather as in bell-ringing. The leader ‘called the changes,' and sometimes kept time with a chant" (Hartley 1979, 185-186). The sound of these spirits might therefore resemble that of a four-member team of threshers.

I have also heard a simultaneous speech of many spirits speaking together, that undulated like a roll, and flowed into the brain in varying directions. Also a speech of certain spirits that terminated 
in a quadruple movement, as if to the tone and sound of men threshing. These spirits are separated from others. They induce a pain in the head, as if from the suction of an air-pump. Some have been 
heard who spoke with a sonorous voice, but as if within, in themselves but still it came to the hearing as speech.  [2] Others who spake by a belching forth of the words as from the belly; these are 
such as wish to give no attention to the sense of a thing, but are forced to speak by others. I have heard some who spoke with a rough or cracked sound; these apply themselves to the left side, under 
the elbow; also to the left external ear. Some I heard who could not speak aloud, but as if they had a cold; these belong to the class of those who by insinuations into the delights of others worm out 
their secrets for the purpose of doing harm.  [3] There are spirits of low stature, who, although few, speak like a great multitude, with a sound like thunder; they were heard above the head, and I 
thought that there was a multitude; but one of them came to me at the left side beneath the arm, and spoke in the same way with a thundering voice; he also moved away, and did the same. Whence such spirits 
come, will of the Lord's Divine mercy be told elsewhere. But these kinds of speech are comparatively rare. It is a remarkable fact that what is said in these various ways is heard as loudly and 
sonorously by one whose interior organs of hearing are opened, and also by spirits, as are sounds and the speech of men on earth; but they are not heard at all by one in whom these organs are not opened. </p>

I have also heard a form of speech that involved many spirits speaking simultaneously. Roaring like waves, it passed into the brain in varying directions. Besides this there is a form of speech existing 
with certain spirits which has a fourfold rhythm, like the noise and sound of people threshing. These spirits are segregated from others. They induce pain in the head like that caused by the suction 
of a pump. I have heard some who spoke with a booming voice, yet as though inwardly, inside themselves; but it nevertheless reached my hearing as speech. </p>
<p></p>
<p><b>[2]</b>
 Others whom I heard spoke by belching 
forth words as if from their belly. These are such as are unwilling to pay any attention to the sense of a thing, but are compelled to speak through others. I have heard some who spoke with a rough 
sound split in two, so to speak. They came up to my left side beneath the elbow, and also up to my left ear. I have also heard some who could not speak loudly enough to be heard, but were like those who 
have a heavy cold. They belong to those spirits who, by worming their way into the delights of others, extract their secrets from them for the purpose of doing harm. </p>
<p></p>
<p><b>[3]</b>
 There are spirits, small 
in stature, who though few in number nevertheless speak like a huge crowd, sounding like thunder. I once heard them overhead and thought there was a large crowd of them, but one of them at that point 
came to my left side below the arm and spoke in like manner with a voice that thundered. He also moved away and did the same thing. Where such spirits come from will in the Lord's Divine mercy be described 
elsewhere. But these kinds of speech are quite rare. It is remarkable how these many forms of speech are heard as loudly and clearly by one whose interior organs of hearing have been opened, and 
also by spirits, as the sounds and speech of men on earth are heard. But by one whose interior organs have not been opened they are not heard at all. </p>

</p><b>1763.</b>
Audita quoque spirituum plurium loquela simultanea, undulans instar voluminis, influens in cerebrum varia determinatione.  Tum loquela quorundam spirituum quae terminatur quadruplicato, quasi ad tonum 
sonum triturantium; hi spiritus ab aliis separati sunt; capiti inducunt dolore tanquam attractionis syringicae.  Auditi qui locuti voce sonora, sed quasi intus in se, sed usque ut loquela ad auditum 
perveniret.  [2] Alii qui locuti per egurgitationem vocum sicut a ventre; sunt tales qui nihil attendere volunt ad sensum rei, sed ad loquendum ab aliis adiguntur.  Audivi qui locuti sono rauco sicut 
bifido; applicant se sinistro lateri sub ulna, etiam sinistrae auriculae.  Tum quoque qui sonore loqui non poterant, sed sicut illi qui in rheumatismo sunt; ex illis sunt qui eliciunt aliorum arcana 
fine nocendi, per insinuationes in jucunda eorum. [3] Sunt spiritus parvi qui tametsi pauci, usque loquuntur sicut ingens multitudo, quasi tonantes; auditi supra caput, et putabam esse multitudinem, 
sed tunc unus ad me venit ad sinistrum latus infra brachium, et similiter cum voce tonante locutus; discessit quoque et similiter faciebat; unde tales, ex Divina Domini Misericordia, alibi.  Sed hae species 
loquelae sunt rariores.  Haec, quod mirum, tam alte et sonore audiuntur cui auditus organa interiora aperta sunt, tum spiritibus, sicut audiuntur soni et loquelae hominis in tellure: at cui non 
aperta sunt, ne hilum. </p>
