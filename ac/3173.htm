Verses 55-58. And her brother and her mother said, Let the damsel remain with us days, at least ten; afterwards thou shalt go. And he said unto them, Do not delay me, and Jehovah hath prospered my way; 
send me away, and I will go to my lord. And they said, Let us call the damsel, and inquire at her mouth. And they called Rebekah, and said unto her, Wilt thou go with this man? And she said, I will 
go. "Her brother and her mother said," signifies a doubting of the natural man; "Let the damsel remain with us," signifies detention by them; "days, at least ten; afterwards thou shalt go," signifies 
the state for departure, appearing to them full; "and he said unto them, Do not delay me," signifies the will of the affection of good; "and Jehovah hath prospered my way," signifies that all things 
were now provided; "send me away, and I will go to my lord," signifies as to the state of initiation; "and they said, Let us call the damsel and inquire at her mouth," signifies the consent solely of 
the affection of truth; "and they called Rebekah, and said unto her, Wilt thou go with this man? And she said, I will go," signifies its full consent. </p>

Vers. 55-58.  Et dixit frater ejus et mater ejus, Maneat puella cum nobis dies aut decem, post ibis. Et dixit ad illos, Ne moremini me, et Jehovah prosperavit viam meam, {1}mitte me, et {2}vadam, domino 
meo. Et dixerunt, Vocemus puellam, et interrogemus os illius. Et vocarunt Rebeccam, et dixerunt ad illam, An eas cum viro hoc? et dixit, Ibo. `Dixit frater ejus et mater ejus' significat dubitationem 
naturalis hominis: `maneat puella cum nobis' significat detentionem ab illis: `dies aut decem, post ibis' significat statum discessionis illis apparentem plenum: `et dixit ad illos, Ne moremini me' 
significat affectionis boni voluntatem: `et Jehovah prosperavit viam meam' significat quod omnia nunc provisa: `{1}mitte me, et vadam domino meo' significat quoad initiationis statum: `et dixerunt, 
Vocemus puellam, et interrogemus os illius' significat consensum solum affectionis veri: `et vocarunt Rebeccam, et dixerunt ad illam, An eas cum viro hoc? et dixit, Ibo' significat ejus plenum consensum. @1
