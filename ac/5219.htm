<h3 align="center" class="ired">属天的奥秘 第5219节</h3>
<h4 align="center"></h4><p><strong>5219.</strong>“看哪，是个梦”表在这种模糊中。这从“梦”的含义清楚可知，“梦”是指一种模糊状态（<a href="1838.htm">1838</a>，<a href="2514.htm">2514</a>，<a href="2528.htm">2528</a>，<a href="5210.htm">5210</a>节）。之所以用“模糊”这个词，是因为真理已被驱逐；事实上，哪里没有真理，哪时就有模糊。天堂之光唯独流入真理，因为天堂之光是从主所接受的神性真理，是居于天使和灵人，以及世人当中的真理之源头；或说居于天使和灵人，以及世人当中的真理是附属的光。它们是附属的光；但它们通过存在于这些真理里面的良善而从神性真理那里获得自己的光。因为真理若非植根于良善，也就是说，若非拥有良善在自己里面，就无法从神性获得任何光。它们通过良善获得光，因为良善就像火或火焰，真理就像这火所发出的光芒。在来世，没有良善的真理虽然发光，但所发的光就像冬光；当天堂之光来临时，这光就转化为黑暗。<br />由此明显可知，“模糊”在此是什么意思，即当好的记忆知识被没有用处的记忆知识驱逐时的一种属世状态。像这样的模糊能接受总体的启示（<a href="5208.htm">5208</a>，<a href="5218.htm">5218</a>节），但由虚假所造成的模糊绝不能接受任何启示；因为虚假具有大量遮挡天堂之光的黑暗，由此造成无法被光照的模糊，除非这些虚假被移除。</p>

<p align="center"><b>Potts(1905-1910) 5219</b></p><p><b>5219.</b>
And behold it was a dream. That this signifies in that obscurity, is evident from the signification of a "dream," as being an obscure state (n. 1838, 2514, 2528, 5210). It is called "obscure," because 
truths had been banished; for where truths are not there is obscurity, because the light of heaven flows only into truths; for the light of heaven is Divine truth from the Lord. Hence the truths with 
angels and spirits, and also with men, are subsidiary lights; but they have their light from the Divine truth by means of the good in the truths; for unless truths are from good, that is unless they 
have good in them, they cannot receive any light from the Divine. They receive it by means of good, for good is like fire or flame, and truths are like the rays of light from it. In the other life truths 
without good do indeed shine, but they shine with a wintry light, that in the light of heaven is thick darkness. From this it is evident that what is here meant by "obscure," is the state of the 
natural when the good memory-knowledges had been banished by those of no use. An obscurity like this can be enlightened in a general manner (n. 5208, 5218), but by no means can that obscurity which comes 
from falsities; for falsities are so many darknesses that shut out the light of heaven, and thus cause an obscurity that cannot be enlightened until the falsities have been removed. </p>

<p align="center"><b>Elliott(1983-1999) 5219</b></p><p><b>5219.</b>
'And behold, it was a dream' means in that obscurity. This is clear from the meaning of 'a dream' as a state that was obscure, dealt with in <a href="1838.htm">1838</a>, <a href="2514.htm">2514</a>, <a href="2528.htm">2528</a>, <a href="5210.htm">5210</a>. The word obscure is used because truths 
have been banished; indeed where there are no truths obscurity exists. The light of heaven flows solely into truths, that light being Divine Truth received from the Lord, the source of truths residing 
with angels and spirits, and with men too. They are subsidiary lights; but they derive their light from Divine Truth through the good present within those truths. For unless truths are rooted in 
good, that is, unless truths have good present within them, they cannot acquire any light from the Divine. They acquire it through good, for good is like a fire or flame, and truths are like lights 
radiating from it. In the next life there are also some truths that shine which are devoid of good; but the light shining from them is a wintry light which turns into thick darkness on the arrival of 
the light of heaven. </p>
<p></p>
<p><b>[2]</b>
 From all this one may now see what is meant here by obscurity, namely a natural state when facts that are good are banished by those that are useless. Such obscurity is one 
that can receive a general enlightenment, <a href="5208.htm">5208</a>, <a href="5218.htm">5218</a>. But obscurity caused by falsities can by no means receive any enlightenment, for falsities are so many masses of darkness which blot out the light 
of heaven and in so doing bring obscurity which cannot be lightened until those falsities have been removed. </p>

<p align="center"><b>Latin(1748-1756) 5219</b>
</p><b>5219.</b>
`Et ecce somnium': quod significet in obscuro illo, constat ex significatione `somnii' quod sit status obscurus, de qua n. 1838, 2514, 2528, 5210. Obscurum dicitur quia vera exterminata sunt, ubi enim 
non vera, ibi est obscurum, lux enim caeli solum in vera influit, nam lux caeli est Divinum Verum a Domino, inde vera apud angelos et apud spiritus, et quoque apud homines; sunt luces succenturiatae, 
sed lucem suam a Divino Vero habent per bonum in veris; nisi enim vera sint ex bono, hoc est, nisi vera bonum in se habeant, non recipere possunt aliquam lucem a Divino; per bonum recipiunt, bonum 
enim est sicut ignis seu flamma, et vera sunt sicut luces inde. Etiam vera absque bono in altera vita lucent, sed lucent luce hiemali, quae lux fit caligo ad lucem caeli; [2] ex his constare potest quid 
per obscurum hic intelligitur, quod nempe status naturalis cum scientifica bona    per scientifica nullius usus exterminata sunt; tale obscurum est quod communiter illustrari potest, n. 5208, 5218; 
at obscurum ex falsis nullatenus potest, falsa enim sunt totidem tenebrositates quae lucem caeli exstinguunt, et faciunt inde obscurum quod illustrari nequit priusquam falsa remota sunt. </p>
