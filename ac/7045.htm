<h3 align="center" class="ired">属天的奥秘 第7045节</h3>
<h4 align="center"></h4><p><strong>7045.</strong>“割下她儿子的阳皮”表除去各种污秽的爱，由此使内在露出来。这从“割下”、“阳皮”和“儿子”清楚可知：“割下”是指除去；“阳皮”是指肉体和世俗的爱，这爱玷污属灵和属天的爱（参看<a href="3412.htm">3412</a>，<a href="4462.htm">4462</a>节）；“儿子”是指代表性教会所拥有的真理。“儿子”表示真理（参看<a href="489.htm">489</a>，<a href="491.htm">491</a>，<a href="533.htm">533</a>，<a href="1147.htm">1147</a>，<a href="2623.htm">2623</a>，<a href="3373.htm">3373</a>节）；此处之所以表示教会所拥有的真理，是因为“西坡拉”代表该教会，并称他为自己的“儿子”。西坡拉还用他来说明这个民族的实际性质，因而说明其敬拜的实际性质。“阳皮”之所以表示污秽的爱，其原因如下：腰和生殖器官对应于婚姻之爱（<a href="5050.htm">5050</a>-<a href="5062.htm">5062</a>节）；它们因对应于婚姻之爱，故对应于一切属天和属灵之爱（<a href="686.htm">686</a>，<a href="4277.htm">4277</a>，<a href="4280.htm">4280</a>，<a href="5054.htm">5054</a>节）；因此，阳皮对应于最外在的爱，也就是所谓的肉体和世俗的爱。这些爱若缺乏内在的爱，也就是所谓的属灵和属天的爱，就是污秽的，这个民族便是这种情形，它就处于没有一个内在的外在。我们说“没有一个内在”，以此表示没有对真理的承认，没有对良善的情感，因而没有信与仁；因为这些是内在人的品质，仁爱的活动，也就是外在的良善，便从它们发出。主称这种缺乏信与仁，却充满邪恶与虚假的内在为“空闲”（马太福音<a href="http://39-27.cn/太12.43.htm">12:43</a>-<a href="http://39-27.cn/太12.45.htm">45</a>）；因此才说“一个没有一个内在的外在”。由于“阳皮”表示最外在的爱，所以当这些爱被除去时（这一点由西坡拉割下阳皮来表示），这些爱的实际性质就会显现，内在因此露出来。</p>

<p align="center"><b>Potts(1905-1910) 7045</b></p><p><b>7045.</b>
And cut off the foreskin of her son. That this signifies the removal of filthy loves, and thereby the laying bare of the internal, is evident from the signification of "cutting off," as being to remove; 
from the signification of "the foreskin," as being earthly and bodily love, which defiles spiritual and celestial love (see n. 3412, 4462); and from the signification of "son," as being the truth 
of the representative church. That a "son" denotes truth may be seen above (n. 489, 491, 533, 1147, 2623, 3373); and that it denotes the truth of that church, is because Zipporah represents that church, 
and calls him her "son," and by him shows the quality of that nation, and hence the quality of its worship. That by the "foreskin" are signified filthy loves, is because the loins with the genitals 
correspond to conjugial love (n. 5050-5062); and because they correspond to conjugial love, they correspond to all celestial and spiritual love (n. 686, 4277, 4280, 5054); and therefore the foreskin 
corresponds to the most external loves, which are called bodily and earthly. If these loves are devoid of internal loves, which are called spiritual and celestial, they are filthy, as was the case with 
that nation, which was in externals without an internal. It is said "without an internal," and by this is meant no acknowledgment of truth, and no affection of good, thus no faith, and no charity, for 
these are of the internal man, and from them proceed the activities of charity, which are external goods. This internal, which is devoid of faith and charity, and yet is full of evils and falsities, 
is called by the Lord "empty" (Matt. 12:43-45); hence it is said, "an external without an internal." Now as by the "foreskin" are signified loves the most external, therefore when they are removed, 
as is signified by Zipporah's cutting off the foreskin, the quality of these loves appears, thus the laying bare of the internal. </p>

<p align="center"><b>Elliott(1983-1999) 7045</b></p><p><b>7045.</b>
'And cut off the foreskin of her son' means the removal of filthy kinds of love, as a result of which the internal is laid bare. This is clear from the meaning of 'cutting off' as removing; from the 
meaning of 'the foreskin' as earthly and bodily love which defiles spiritual and celestial love, dealt with in <a href="3412.htm">3412</a>, <a href="4462.htm">4462</a>; and from the meaning of 'son' as the truth which the representative Church possesses. 
For the meaning of 'son' as truth, see <a href="489.htm">489</a>, <a href="491.htm">491</a>, <a href="533.htm">533</a>, <a href="1147.htm">1147</a>, <a href="2623.htm">2623</a>, <a href="3773.htm">3773</a>; and the reason why the truth which that Church possesses is meant here is that 'Zipporah' represents that Church and calls 
him 'her son'. She also uses him to show the actual nature of that nation and consequently the actual nature of its worship. 'The foreskin' means filthy kinds of love for the following reason: The 
loins and genital organs correspond to conjugial love, <a href="5050.htm">5050</a>-<a href="5062.htm">5062</a>; and since they correspond to conjugial love they also correspond to every kind of celestial and spiritual love, <a href="686.htm">686</a>, <a href="4277.htm">4277</a>, <a href="4280.htm">4280</a>, <a href="5054.htm">5054</a>. 
The foreskin therefore corresponds to the kinds of love that are very much external, which are called bodily and earthly loves. If these loves are devoid of the internal kinds of love that are called 
spiritual and celestial loves, they are filthy, as they were with that nation which had externals without an internal. The words 'without an internal' are used, and by this is meant no acknowledgement 
of truth and no affection for good, thus no faith and no charity; for these are qualities that belong to the internal man and from them spring ways of exercising charity, which are external forms of 
good. The Lord speaks of that internal, when it is devoid of faith and charity and yet full of evils and falsities, as that which is 'empty', in <a href="http://bible.gospelcom.net/cgi-bin/bible?passage=Matt%2012:43-45&amp;version=ESV&amp;interface=print&amp;showfn=yes&amp;showxref">Matt 12:43-45</a>. This is what 'external without an internal' 
serves to describe. So then 'the foreskin' means the kinds of love that are very much external; therefore when those kinds of love have been removed, meant by Zipporah's cutting off the foreskin, 
the actual nature of them is seen, and the internal is accordingly laid bare.  </p>

`Et abscidit praeputium filii sui': quod significet remotionem amorum spurcorum et per id nudationem interni, constat ex significatione `abscindere' quod sit removere; ex significatione `praeputii' 
quod sit amor terrestris et corporeus qui conspurcat amorem spiritualem et caelestem, de qua n. 3412, 4462; et ex significatione `filii' quod sit verum Ecclesiae repraesentativae; quod `filius' sit verum, 
videatur n. 489, 491, 533, (x)1147, 2623, 3373; et quod sit illius Ecclesiae {1}, est quia Zippora {2}repraesentat Ecclesiam illam, et vocat illum filium suum, et per illum ostendit quale gentis 
illius, et inde quale cultus ejus. Quod per `praeputium' significentur amores spurci, est quia lumbi cum genitalibus correspondent amori conjugiali, n. 5050-5062; et quia correspondent amori conjugiali, 
{3} correspondent omni amori caelesti et spirituali, n. 686, 4277, 4280, 5054; ideo praeputium correspondet amoribus maxime {4}externis, qui vocantur amores corporei et terrestres; hi amores, si absque 
amoribus internis sunt qui vocantur amores spirituales et caelestes, sunt spurci, ut apud gentem illam quae in externis absque interno fuit.  Absque interno dicitur, et per id intelligitur nulla 
agnitio veri et nulla affectio boni, ita nulla fides et nulla charitas, haec enim sunt interni hominis, {5}et inde procedunt charitatis exercitia, quae sunt bona externa; (m)internum hoc, {6}quod absque 
fide et charitate {7}, et tamen plenum malis et falsis, vocatur a Domino vacuum, Matth. xii 43-45; {8}inde dicitur externum absque interno;(n) nunc quia per `praeputium' significantur amores maxime 
externi, idcirco cum illi remoti sunt, quod significatur per quod `Zippora absciderit praeputium,' apparet quale amorum illorum, ita nudatio interni. 	@1 i verum$ 	@2 per quam Ecclesia illa repraesentatur$ 	@3
