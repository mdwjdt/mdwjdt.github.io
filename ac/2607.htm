<h3 align="center" class="ired">属天的奥秘 第2607节</h3>
<h4 align="center"></h4><p><strong>2607.</strong>关于历史，除了创世记头几章的历史是虚构的外，其它的全都是真实的，如第一卷所示。它们虽是真实的，却仍具有内义，并且就内义而言，和预言一样，唯独论述主。它们固然论述天堂与教会，以及天堂与教会所属一切，但由于这些是主的，所以历史描述即便论及天堂与教会，最终也指向主，并由此而成为圣言。那里所记载的所有历史事件都是代表物，并且描述它们的每句话都具有灵义。历史事件都是代表物，这一点从至此有关亚伯拉罕的解读，以及蒙主怜悯，从下文所给出的有关以撒，雅各，他的十二个儿子，埃及，百姓在旷野飘荡、进入迦南地等的解读清楚看出来。例如，名字表示真实事物，如“埃及”表记忆知识，“亚述”表心智的理性部分，“以法莲”表心智的觉性部分，“推罗”表认知，“锡安”表属天的教会，“耶路撒冷”表属灵的教会等等。一些特定词语的含义同样说明这一点，如“国王”表真理，“祭司”表良善，其它所有词也具有各自的内义，如“国”、“城”、“家（house）”、“民族”、“人民（或百姓，people）”、“园子”、“葡萄园”、“橄榄园”、“金”、“银”、“铜”、“铁”、“鸟”、“兽”、“饼”、“酒”、“油”、“早晨”、“白昼”、“光”等。这类词在整个历史书和预言书中始终都有，尽管它们是由不同的作者，或在不同时期写下的。若圣言不是从天而降的，这是永远不可能的。由此可知，圣言具有内义，这一点从以下事实也可以看出来：即神性圣言绝不可能仅仅论述世人，如亚伯拉罕、以撒、雅各、他们的后代（这些后代更糟糕），或其国王、妻子、儿女，或妓女、掠夺之类的事。所有这些事就本身而言，并不值得在圣言中被提及，除非它们代表和表示诸如在主国度里的那类事物。这些事物才是值得记录在圣言中的。</p>

As regards the historicals they are all historically true, except those in the first chapters of Genesis, which are made up history, as shown in volume 1. Yet although they are historically true, they 
nevertheless have an internal sense; and in that sense, like the propheticals, treat solely of the Lord. They do indeed treat of heaven and the church, and of what belongs to heaven and the church, 
but as these are of the Lord, through these the historicals look to the Lord, and therefore are the Word. The historic events are all representative, and every word by which they are described is significative. 
That the historic events are representative is evident from what has been unfolded thus far concerning Abraham, and will be further evident from what of the Lord's Divine mercy is to be explained 
concerning Isaac, Jacob, and his twelve sons; concerning Egypt, the sojourning of the people in the wilderness, their entrance into the land of Canaan, etc. [2] That every word by which these 
historicals are described is significative, is also evident from what has been shown for instance in regard to the names as signifying actual things; thus "Egypt" signifies memory-knowledge, "Asshur" 
the rational, "Ephraim" the intellectual, "Tyre" knowledges, "Zion" the celestial church, "Jerusalem" the spiritual church, and so on. The same has been shown in regard to the words; as that "king" signifies 
truth, "priest" good, and that all other words have their respective internal significance; such as "kingdom," "city," "house," "nation," "people," "garden," "vineyard," "oliveyard," "gold," "silver," 
"brass," "iron," "birds," "beasts," "bread," "wine," "oil," "morning," "day," "light;" and this uniformly in both the historical and the prophetical books, although they were written by various 
individuals, and at different times-a uniformity that would not be possible unless the Word had come down from heaven. From this it may be known that there is an internal sense in the Word; as well 
as from the fact that the Divine Word cannot treat of mere men, such as Abraham, Isaac, Jacob, and their posterity (which was the worst of nations); of their kings, their wives, sons, and daughters; 
of harlots, plunderings, and such things, which, considered in themselves, are not worthy to be even mentioned in the Word, unless by them are represented and signified such things as are in the Lord's 
kingdom: it is these things that are worthy of the Word. </p>

As regards the historical narratives, with the exception of those in the initial chapters of Genesis, which are made-up history, and have been dealt with in Volume One, they are all historically true. 
But although historically true they nevertheless possess an internal sense; and in that sense the one subject, as with the prophetical sections, is the Lord. They do, it is true, have reference as well 
to heaven and the Church, and to what belongs to heaven and the Church; but as these are the Lord's, historical descriptions, even when they have reference to heaven and the Church, ultimately have 
regard to the Lord, and on that account are the Word. All the historical events recorded there are representative, and each word used to describe them carries a spiritual meaning. The fact that the 
historical events are representative is clear from what has been explained up to this point regarding Abraham, and will be clear from the explanations that must be given, in the Lord's Divine mercy, regarding 
Isaac, Jacob, his twelve sons, Egypt, the people's wandering in the wilderness, their entry into the land of Canaan, and everything else. </p>
<p></p>
<p><b>[2]</b>
 That individual words used to describe them carry 
a spiritual meaning is also evident from what has been shown, for example, about names meaning real things, such as that Egypt means knowledge, Asshur the rational part of the mind, Ephraim the intellectual 
part, Tyre cognitions, Zion the celestial Church, Jerusalem the spiritual Church, and so on with everything else. The same has been shown to be so with particular expressions, such as that 
'a king' means truth, 'a priest' good, and that all other words - such as kingdom, city, house, nation, people, garden, vineyard, olive-grove, gold, silver, bronze, iron, birds, beasts, bread, wine, oil, 
morning, day, light - each have their specific internal meaning. This is consistently so in the historical books as well as the prophetical, even though they were written by various authors and in 
different periods. This consistency would never have been possible if the Word had not come down out of heaven. From all this one may know that there is an internal sense in the Word, as well as from 
the fact that the Divine Word cannot possibly be about mere human beings such as Abraham, Isaac, Jacob, and their descendants who formed the worst of the nations; or about their kings, wives, sons, daughters, 
prostitutes, plunderings, and like matters, all of which regarded in themselves are not worthy of mention in the Word unless by means of them such things as exist in the Lord's kingdom are represented 
and meant. It is these that are worthy of the Word. </p>

Quod historica attinet, sunt omnia historice vera quae ibi; praeter quae in primis capitibus Geneseos quae historica facta sunt, de quibus in Parte Prima: et tametsi historice vera sunt, usque sensum 
internum habent, et in eo sensu, sicut prophetica, agunt unice de Domino; agunt etiam de caelo et Ecclesia, et quae caeli et Ecclesiae sunt, sed illa sunt Domini, quare per illa spectant Dominum; inde 
sunt Verbum; historica ibi omnia sunt repraesentativa, et singula verba quibus describuntur, sunt significativa; quod historica sint repraesentativa, constat ab illis quae hactenus de Abrahamo {1} 
explicata sunt, et constabit (c)ab illis quae de Isaco, de Jacobo, ejus duodecim filiis, de Aegypto, de peregrinatione populi in deserto, de ingressu ejus in terram Canaanem, et de reliquis, ex Divina 
Domini Misericordia, explicanda sunt: [2] quod singula verba quibus describuntur, sint significativa, patet etiam ab illis quae ostensa sunt, ut quod nomina significent res, sicut Aegyptus scientiam, 
Asshur rationale, Ephraim intellectuale, Tyrus cognitiones, Zion Ecclesiam caelestem, Hierosolyma spiritualem, et sic reliqua; similiter voces, sicut quod rex significet verum, sacerdos bonum, et quod 
in suo interno significatur sint reliquae, sicut regnum, urbs, domus, gens, populus, hortus, vinea, olivetum, aurum, argentum, aes, ferrum, aves, bestiae, panis, vinum, oleum, mane, dies, lux, et hoc 
constanter, tam in libris historicis quam {2} propheticis, tametsi a variis scripti sunt et diversis temporibus; quod nusquam tam constans foret nisi Verbum e caelo descenderit.  Exinde sciri potest 
quod sensus internus sit in Verbo, praeter etiam ex eo quod Divinum Verbum nusquam agere possit de meris hominibus, ut de Abrahamo, Isaco, Jacobo, posteritate eorum, quae pessima gentium fuit, de regibus 
eorum, uxoribus, filiis, filiabus, meretricibus, rapinis, et parilibus, quae in se spectata ne quidem digna sunt ut nominentur in Verbo nisi per illa repraesentata et significata sint talia quae 
in regno Domini; haec sunt Verbo digna. 	@1 Abramo.$ 	@2 i in.$ </p>
