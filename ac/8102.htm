<h3 align="center" class="ired">属天的奥秘 第8102节</h3>
<h4 align="center"></h4><p><strong>8102.</strong>无需进一步解释这些话，因为它们在前面（创世记<a href="http://39-27.cn/创50.24.htm">50:24</a>，<a href="http://39-27.cn/创50.25.htm">25</a>）已经解释过了，那里有类似的话（参看<a href="6590.htm">6590</a>，<a href="6952.htm">6952</a>节）。<br />8102a.出埃及记13:20-22.他们从疏割起行，在旷野边的以倘安营。日间，耶和华在云柱中走在他们前面，领他们的路；夜间，在火柱中给他们光明，使他们日夜都可以行走。日间云柱，夜间火柱，总不离开百姓的面前。<br />“他们从疏割起行，在以倘安营”表他们被释放后的第二个状态。“旷野边的”表试探的第一个状态。“耶和华走在他们前面”表主始终同在。“日间，在云柱中”表当有一种启示状态时，它就被真理的模糊缓和。“领他们的路”表神性指引。“夜间，在火柱中给他们光明”表当有一种模糊状态时，它就被来自良善的启示缓和。“使他们日夜都可以行走”表由此处于这两种状态下的生活。“日间云柱，夜间火柱，总不离开百姓的面前”表主的同在是永恒的。</p>

It is needless to unfold these words further, because they have been already unfolded at Gen. 50:24, 25, where like words occur (see n. 6590, 6952). </p>
<p>8102a. Verses 20-22. And they journeyed from Succoth, 
and encamped in Etham, at the end of the wilderness. And Jehovah went before them by day in a pillar of cloud, to lead them in the way; and by night in a pillar of fire, to give them light; to 
go by day and by night. The pillar of cloud by day, and the pillar of fire by night, departed not from before the people. "And they journeyed from Succoth, and encamped in Etham," signifies the second 
state after they were liberated; "at the end of the wilderness," signifies the first state of temptations; "and Jehovah went before them," signifies the continuous presence of the Lord; "by day in a 
pillar of cloud," signifies that when there was a state of enlightenment, it was tempered by obscurity of truth; "to lead them in the way," signifies the Divine auspices; "and by night in a pillar of 
fire, to give them light," signifies that when there was a state of obscurity it was tempered by enlightenment from good; "to go by day and by night," signifies thus life in both states; "the pillar of 
cloud by day, and the pillar of fire by night, departed not from before the people," signifies that the presence of the Lord was perpetual. </p>

Further explanation of these matters can be dispensed with since they have been explained before, at <a href="http://bible.gospelcom.net/cgi-bin/bible?passage=Gen%2050:24,25&amp;version=ESV&amp;interface=print&amp;showfn=yes&amp;showxref">Gen 50:24,25</a>, where similar words occur, see <a href="6590.htm">6590</a>, <a href="6592.htm">6592</a>. </p>
<p><a href="8102.htm">8102</a>a Verses 20-22 And they travelled 
from Succoth and encamped in Etham, on the edge of the wilderness. And Jehovah went before them during the daytime in a pillar of cloud to lead them [along] the way, and by night in a pillar of fire 
to give them light, so as to go by day and by night. The pillar of cloud during the daytime and the pillar of fire by night did not depart from before the people. </p>
<p>'And they travelled from Succoth and 
encamped in Etham' means the second state after they were delivered. 'On the edge of the wilderness' means the first state of temptations. 'And Jehovah went before them' means the Lord's constant presence. 
'During the daytime in a pillar of cloud' means that when there was a state of enlightenment, this was moderated by a dimming of truth. 'To lead them [along] the way' means Divine guidance. 'And 
by night in a pillar of fire to give them light' means that when there was a state of dimness, this was moderated by enlightenment from good. 'So as to go by day and by night' means thus life in both 
states. 'The pillar of cloud during the daytime and the pillar of fire by night, did not depart from before the people' means the Lord's presence, that it was unceasing. </p>

Haec supersedentur ulterius explicare, quia prius ad Gen. l 24, 25, explicata sunt, ubi similia verba, videatur n. 6590, 6592. </p>
<p>8102[a].  Vers. 20-22.  Et profecti e Succoth, et castrametati in Etham, 
in fine deserti.  Et Jehovah ibat ante illos interdiu in columna nubis, ad ducendum illos via, et noctu in columna ignis ad illuminandum illos, ad eundum diu et noctu.  Non recedebat columna nubis 
interdiu, et columna ignis noctu, ante populum.  `Et profecti e Succoth, et castrametati in Etham' significat statum secundum postquam liberati: `in fine deserti' significat statum primum tentationum: 
`et Jehovah ibat ante illos' significat continuam praesentiam Domini: `interdiu in columna nubis' significat cum status illustrationis quod temperatus per obscurum veri: `ad ducendum illos via' significat 
auspicium Divinum: `et noctu in columna ignis ad illuminandum illos' significat cum status obscuritatis quod temperatus per illustrationem a bono: `ad eundum diu et noctu' significat sic vitam 
in utroque statu: `non recedebat columna nubis interdiu, et columna ignis noctu, ante populum' significat praesentiam Domini, quod perpetua. </p>
