<h3 align="center" class="ired">属天的奥秘 第6759节</h3>
<h4 align="center"></h4><p><strong>6759.</strong>“就是他的一个弟兄”表他要与之结合的真理。这从“弟兄”的含义清楚可知，“弟兄”是指教会的真理（参看<a href="6756.htm">6756</a>节）。由于他自己处于这些真理，并且“弟兄”表示他要与之结合的教会真理，所以此处由于内义上的思路而表示结合</p>

One of his brethren. That this signifies with which he was conjoined, is evident from the signification of "brethren," as being the truths of the church (see n. 6756); and as he himself was in these, 
and it was the truths which are signified by his "brethren" with whom he was conjoined, therefore here, by reason of the connection of things in the internal sense, there is meant conjunction. </p>

<p align="center"><b>Elliott(1983-1999) 6759</b></p><p><b>6759.</b>
'One of his brothers' means the truths to which he was to be joined. This is clear from the meaning of 'brothers' as the Church's truths, dealt with above in <a href="6756.htm">6756</a> Since he was himself guided by these 
truths, and the Church's truths, meant by 'brothers', were what he was to be joined to, that joining together is meant here because of the train of thought in the internal sense. </p>

</p><b>6759.</b>
`E fratribus suis': quod significet quibus conjunctus esset, constat ex significatione `fratrum' quod sint vera Ecclesiae, de qua supra n. 6756; in quibus quia ipse erat, et vera Ecclesiae quae per 
`fratres' significantur erant, cum quibus conjunctus esset, hic ob nexum rerum in sensu interno intelligitur conjunctio. </p>
