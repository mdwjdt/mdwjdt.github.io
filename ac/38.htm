<h3 align="center" class="ired">属天的奥秘 第38节</h3>
<h4 align="center"></h4><p><strong>38.</strong>创世记1:18 管理昼夜，分别明暗。神看着是好的。<br />“昼”表善，“夜”表恶，故在俗语中，善行被称为“光明之举”，恶行被称为“暗昧之举”。“明”表真理，“暗”表虚假，正如主说：“光来到世间，世人因自己的行为是恶的，不爱光倒爱黑暗……但行真理的必来就光。”（约翰福音<a href="http://39-27.cn/约3.19.htm">3:19</a>-<a href="http://39-27.cn/约3.21.htm">21</a>）<br />创世记1:19 有晚上，有早晨，是第四日。</p>

Verse 15. And to rule in the day, and in the night, and to distinguish between the light and the darkness; and God saw that it was good. By the "day" is meant good, by the "night" evil; and therefore 
goods are called works of the day, but evils works of the night; by the "light" is meant truth, and by the "darkness" falsity, as the Lord says: </p>
<p>     Men loved darkness rather than light. He that doeth 
truth cometh to the light (John 3:19, 21). Verse 19. And the evening and the morning were the fourth day. </p>

<p align="center"><b>Elliott(1983-1999) 38</b></p><p><b>38.</b>
Verse 18 And to have dominion over the day and the night, and to make a distinction between the light and the darkness; and God saw that it was good. </p>
<p>'The day' is used to mean good, and 'the night' 
evil. Consequently goods are called 'the works of the day', whereas evils are called 'the works of the night'. 'The light' is used to mean truth, and 'the darkness' falsity, just as the Lord says,  </p>
<blockquote>
Men 
preferred darkness rather than light; he who does the truth comes to the light. <a href="http://bible.gospelcom.net/cgi-bin/bible?passage=John%203:19-21&amp;version=ESV&amp;interface=print&amp;showfn=yes&amp;showxref">John 3:19-21</a>.

Vers. 18.  Et ad dominandum in die, et in nocte, et ad distinguendum inter lucem, et inter tenebras; et vidit Deus quod bonum. Per 'diem' intelligitur bonum, per 'noctem' malum; quare bona appellantur 
opera diei, mala autem opera noctis: per 'lucem' intelligitur verum, et per 'tenebras' falsum, sicut Dominus loquitur, Dilexerunt homines magis tenebras quam lucem; qua facit veritatem, venit ad lucem, 
Joh. iii 19-21. Vers. 19.  Et fuit vespera, et fuit mane, dies quartus. </p>
