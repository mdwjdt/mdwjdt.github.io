<h3 align="center" class="ired">属天的奥秘 第6864节</h3>
<h4 align="center"></h4><p><strong>6864.</strong>“现在你去，我要差你到法老那里”表从主的人身发出的神圣，发出的神圣将驱散侵扰的虚假。这从“摩西”和“法老”的代表，以及“差”的含义清楚可知：那要去、被差的“摩西”是指神之律法方面 （参看<a href="6723.htm">6723</a>，<a href="6752.htm">6752</a>，<a href="6771.htm">6771</a>，<a href="6827.htm">6827</a>节），因而人身方面的主，因为当主在世时，祂首先将祂的人身变成神性真理（神性真理与神的律法是一样的），之后完全荣耀了祂的人身，并将它变成神性良善（神性真理和神性良善之间的区别如同太阳发出的光和太阳里面的火之间的区别）；“差”是指发出（<a href="2397.htm">2397</a>，<a href="4710.htm">4710</a>，<a href="6831.htm">6831</a>节），在此是指神圣真理，“神圣”这个词论及真理（参看<a href="6788.htm">6788</a>节）；“法老”是指虚假（<a href="6651.htm">6651</a>，<a href="6679.htm">6679</a>，<a href="6683.htm">6683</a>，<a href="6692.htm">6692</a>节）。之所以补充说，侵扰的虚假将被驱散，也就是说，将被从主发出的神圣驱散，是因为下文论述的主题是以色列人，也就是那些属于主的属灵教会之人，以及他们从虚假中所获得的解释；他们若不通过从主发出的神圣，根本不可能获得解救。因为从主发出的神圣不仅驱散侵扰的虚假，还把一切事物，既包括众天堂里的事物，与包括众地狱里的事物，都排列成神性秩序，并使各天堂照着良善和衍生的真理而彼此完全不同，互相分离，也使各地狱照着邪恶和衍生的虚假而彼此完全不同，互相分离，同样使邪恶与良善对立，虚假与真理对立，以便一种属灵的平衡能得以存在，一切事物都处于一种自由的状态。</p>

And now go, and I will send thee unto Pharaoh. That this signifies the holy proceeding from the Lord's Human, by which infesting falsities would be dispersed, is evident from the representation of Moses, 
who was to go, and who was sent, as being the Lord as to the law Divine (see n. 6723, 6752, 6771, 6827), thus as to the Human; for when the Lord was in the world, He first made His Human Divine truth, 
which is the same as the law Divine; and afterward He completely glorified His Human, and made it Divine good (between Divine truth and Divine good there is a difference such as there is between 
the light from the sun and the fire in the sun); and from the signification of "to be sent" as being to proceed (n. 2397, 4710, 6831), here holy truth (that holy is predicated of truth see n. 6788); 
and from the representation of Pharaoh, as being falsity (n. 6651, 6679, 6683, 6692). It is added that infesting falsities would be dispersed, namely, by the holy proceeding from the Lord's Human, because 
in what follows the subject treated of is the liberation of the sons of Israel, that is, of those who were of the Lord's spiritual church, from falsities; from which they can in no wise be liberated 
except by the holy which proceeds from the Lord. For the holy proceeding from the Lord not only disperses infesting falsities, but also reduces all things into Divine order, both those which are in 
the heavens, and those which are in the hells; and causes the heavens to be most distinct according to goods and the derivative truths, and the hells also to be most distinct according to evils and 
the derivative falsities; and likewise causes evils to be opposite to goods, and falsities to truths, in order that a spiritual equilibrium may exist, and everything be in a free state. </p>

'And now, go, I will send you to Pharaoh' means the Holy influence going forth from the Lord's Human, by which molesting falsities would be dispelled. This is clear from the representation of 'Moses', 
who was to go and who was being sent, as the Lord in respect of the law of God, dealt with in <a href="6713.htm">6713</a>, <a href="6752.htm">6752</a>, <a href="6771.htm">6771</a>, <a href="6827.htm">6827</a>, and so in respect of the Human (for when the Lord was in the world He first made 
His Human Divine Truth, which is the same as the law of God, then after that He completely glorified His Human and made it Divine Good, the difference between Divine Truth and Divine Good being like 
that between the light radiated from the sun and the fire within the sun); from the meaning of 'being sent' as going forth, dealt with in <a href="2797.htm">2797</a>, <a href="4710.htm">4710</a>, <a href="6831.htm">6831</a>, in this instance holy truth (regarding the use 
of the word 'holy' in reference to truth, see <a href="6788.htm">6788</a>); and from the representation of 'Pharaoh' as falsity, dealt with in <a href="6651.htm">6651</a>, <a href="6679.htm">6679</a>, <a href="6683.htm">6683</a>, <a href="6692.htm">6692</a>. The reason for the addition of the statement that the 
molesting falsities would be dispelled - dispelled, that is, by the Holy influence going forth from the Lord's Human - is that what follows deals with the children of Israel, meaning those belonging 
to the Lord's spiritual Church, and their deliverance from falsities, from which they cannot be delivered at all except by the Holy influence that goes forth from the Lord. For that Holy influence going 
forth from the Lord not only dispels molesting falsities but also arranges all things into Divine order, both those in the heavens and those in the hells. The effect of that influence is such that 
it makes the heavens completely distinct and separate from one another, as determined by their forms of good and consequent truths, and also makes the hells completely distinct and separate, as determined 
by their evils and consequent falsities. It also places these kinds of evil opposite those kinds of good, and falsities opposite truths, in order that equilibrium may be established spiritual level 
and nothing excluded from a state of freedom. </p>

Et nunc ito, [et] mittam te ad Pharaonem': quod significet Sanctum procedens ab Humano Domini, quo falsa infestantia dissiparentur, constat ex repraesentatione `Moschis' qui iret et qui mittebatur, 
quod sit Dominus quoad legem Divinam, de qua n. 6723, 6752, 6771, 6827, ita quoad Humanum; nam cum Dominus in mundo fuit, Humanum Suum primum fecit Divinum Verum, quod idem est cum lege Divina; postmodum 
{1} Humanum Suum prorsus glorificavit et fecit Divinum Bonum; inter Divinum Verum et Divinum Bonum differentia est qualis inter lucem a sole et {2}ignem in sole; ex significatione `mitti' quod sit 
procedere, de qua n. 2397, 4710, 6831, hic sanctum verum; quod sanctum praedicetur de vero, videatur n. 6788; et a repraesentatione `Pharaonis' quod sit falsum, de qua n. 6651, 6679, 6683, 6692; additur 
quod falsa infestantia dissiparentur, nempe a Sancto procedente ab Humano Domini, quia in sequentibus agitur de liberatione filiorum Israelis, hoc est, illorum qui ab Ecclesia spirituali Domini sunt, 
a falsis, a quibus liberari nequaquam possunt quam a Sancto quod procedit a Domino; Sanctum enim procedens a Domino non modo dissipat falsa infestantia sed etiam redigit omnia in Divinum ordinem, 
tam illa quae in caelis sunt quam illa quae in infernis, et (x)facit ut caeli distinctissimi sint secundum bona et inde vera, et quoque quod inferna distinctissima sint secundum mala et inde falsa; et 
quod mala in opposito sint contra bona, ac falsa contra vera, ut aequilibrium spirituale existat, et nihil non in statu libero sit. 	@1 i autem$ 	@2 flammam$ </p>
