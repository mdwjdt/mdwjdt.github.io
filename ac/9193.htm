<h3 align="center" class="ired">属天的奥秘 第9193节</h3>
<h4 align="center"></h4><p><strong>9193.</strong>“那人必要灭绝”表被逐出。这从“灭绝”的含义清楚可知，“灭绝”当论及那些处于邪恶所生虚假的敬拜之人时，是指被逐出，也就是从教会被逐出。将这些虚假从教会逐出，从而把它们根除，由“灭绝”来表示，这一点明显可见于摩西五经：<br />有些匪类从你们中间出来，催促本城的居民，说，我们去侍奉你们素来所不认识的别神。若果然是真，准有这可憎恶的事行在你们中间，你必要用剑刃击杀那城里的居民，把城里所有的，连牲畜都用剑刃灭绝。你从那城里所夺的一切都要一起带到街道中间，用火将城和其内所夺一切，整个城都在耶和华你神面前焚烧，那城就永为荒堆，不可再建造。那当灭绝的物连一点都不可粘你的手。（申命记<a href="http://39-27.cn/申13.12.htm">13:12</a>-<a href="http://39-27.cn/申13.17.htm">17</a>）<br />“灭绝的物”就表示邪恶所生的虚假，这一点从这些经文在内义上的细节明显看出来。“要被灭绝的城”是指教义，在此是指虚假教义（参看<a href="2712.htm">2712</a>，<a href="2943.htm">2943</a>，<a href="3216.htm">3216</a>节）；“要击杀人和牲畜所用的剑刃”是指与邪恶所生的虚假争战并摧毁它的真理（<a href="2799.htm">2799</a>，<a href="4499.htm">4499</a>，<a href="7102.htm">7102</a>，<a href="8294.htm">8294</a>节）；“所夺之物要被一起带到中间的街道”是指教义的真理，在反面意义上是指教义的虚假（<a href="2336.htm">2336</a>节）；“要将所夺之物与城一起焚烧的火”是指自我之爱的邪恶（<a href="1297.htm">1297</a>，<a href="2446.htm">2446</a>，<a href="5071.htm">5071</a>，<a href="5215.htm">5215</a>，<a href="6314.htm">6314</a>，<a href="6832.htm">6832</a>，<a href="7324.htm">7324</a>节）。由此明显可知，这种“灭绝”表示从教会逐出并根除。因此，经上还吩咐说，迦南地的列族要被“灭绝”（申命记<a href="http://39-27.cn/申7.2.htm">7:2</a>，<a href="http://39-27.cn/申7.24.htm">24</a>-<a href="http://39-27.cn/申7.26.htm">26</a>）。因为这些民族以前曾在那地建立教会，这也为何他们有祭坛，还献祭（<a href="3686.htm">3686</a>，<a href="4447.htm">4447</a>，<a href="4454.htm">4454</a>，<a href="4516.htm">4516</a>，<a href="4517.htm">4517</a>，<a href="5136.htm">5136</a>，<a href="6306.htm">6306</a>，<a href="6516.htm">6516</a>，<a href="8054.htm">8054</a>节）。但当他们将代表性敬拜，就是古教会的敬拜，转变为偶像崇拜，并由此歪曲真理、玷污良善（<a href="8317.htm">8317</a>节）时，经上命令不仅人，而且连城和城里所有的都要灭绝。<br />发出这命令的原因是，那里的一切都代表邪恶所生的虚假。城本身代表实际的虚假教义；牲畜代表邪恶的情感；金银代表他们的邪恶和虚假；其它一切事物也一样。古教会敬拜的主要特征就是以一个人的形式敬拜神，也就是敬拜主。但当他们从良善转向邪恶时，就开始敬拜用来代表祂的实际物体，如日月星辰，以及亚舍拉（groves），柱子和各种偶像形式的神。因此，他们敬拜脱离内在之物的外在之物，如当内在人被关闭时的情形。关闭内在人的，是邪恶的生活；因为主通过良善流入，并打开内在人；因此，关闭这内在人的，是邪恶。一旦内在人被关闭，真理就转变为虚假；它们保留下来，也只是服务于自我之爱和尘世之爱的邪恶。内在敬拜主要在于承认主是独一神，承认一切良善和真理皆来自祂，或说祂是一切良善和真理的源头。在教会中，那些不承认祂的人不可能处于良善，因而也不可能处于真理；承认祂的人是那些拥有真理，同时过着良善生活的人，而不是那些过着邪恶生活的人（<a href="8878.htm">8878</a>节）。承认并敬拜主就是照祂的诫命生活，也就是过一种信与仁的生活（参看<a href="8252.htm">8252</a>-<a href="8257.htm">8257</a>节）。信之生活在于出于顺服遵行诫命，仁之生活在于出于爱遵行诫命。</p>

Shall be accursed. That this signifies a casting out, is evident from the signification of "being accursed," when said of those who are in the worship of falsities from evil, as being to be cast out, 
that is, from the church. That to be cast out from the church, and thus the rooting out of such falsities, is signified by "being accursed" is plain in Moses: </p>
<p>     If men of Belial shall go out from 
the midst of thee, and shall urge the inhabitants of their city, saying, Let us go and serve other gods, which ye have not known; if it be truth, and the thing certain, that such abomination is wrought 
in the midst of thee; smiting thou shalt smite the inhabitants of that city with the edge of the sword, making it accursed, and everyone that is therein, and also the beast thereof, with the edge of 
the sword. All the spoil of it thou shalt carry together into the midst of the street, and shalt burn the city with fire, and all the spoil thereof, to Jehovah thy God; that it may be a heap for eternity; 
neither shall it be built any more; so that there may not cleave to thine hand anything of the accursed thing (Deut. 13:13-17). [2] That it is the falsity from evil which is signified by "the 
accursed thing," is plain from each detail in the above passage in the internal sense; for "the cities which were to be accursed" denote doctrines, here false doctrines (see n. 2712, 2943, 3216); "the 
edge of the sword, with which the men and beasts were to be smitten," denotes truth fighting and destroying the falsity which is from evil (n. 2799, 4499, 7102, 8294); "the street into the midst of 
which the spoil was to be carried together" denotes the truth of doctrine, and in the opposite sense, the falsity of doctrine (n. 2336); "the fire with which the spoil was to be burned together with the 
city," denotes the evil of the love of self (n. 1297, 2446, 5071, 5215, 6314, 6832, 7324). From this it is evident that this "accursing" denotes a casting out from the church, and a rooting out. Wherefore 
also it was commanded that the nations in the land of Canaan should be "accursed" (Deut. 7:2, 24-26); for these nations had formerly constituted the church in that land, and therefore they had 
altars, and likewise offered sacrifices (n. 3686, 4447, 4454, 4516, 4517, 5136, 6306, 6516, 8054); but when they turned the representative worship, which belonged to the Ancient Church, into idolatrous 
worship, and thus falsified truths and adulterated goods (n. 8317), it was ordered that not only the men, but also the cities and what was in the cities, should be "accursed."  [3] The reason was 
that all things therein represented falsities from evil; the cities themselves, doctrines of falsity; the beasts, evil affections; the gold and silver, their evils and falsities; and all other things 
in like manner. The main feature of the worship of the Ancient Church was the worship of God under a human form, thus of the Lord. But when they turned aside from good to evil, they began to worship the 
representatives themselves, such as the sun, the moon, the stars, also groves, statues, and God under various idol forms, thus external things apart from anything internal, as is the case when the 
internal man has been closed. The internal man is closed by a life of evil; for the Lord flows in by good, and opens the internal man; and consequently it is closed by evil. And when the internal man 
has been closed, truths are turned into falsities; and where they remain as truths, they merely serve the evils which are of the love of self and the love of the world. The main thing of internal worship 
is to acknowledge the Lord as the one and only God, and that everything good and true is from Him. Those in the church who do not acknowledge Him cannot be in good, thus neither can they be in truth. 
Those acknowledge Him who are in faith, and at the same time in the good of life; but not those who are in evil of life (n. 8878). That to acknowledge and worship the Lord is to live according to 
His commandments, that is, to live a life of faith and charity, see n. 8252-8257. A life of faith consists in doing the commandments from obedience and a life of charity in doing the commandments from love. </p>

<p align="center"><b>Elliott(1983-1999) 9193</b></p><p><b>9193.</b>
'Shall be utterly destroyed' means being cast out. This is clear from the meaning of 'being utterly destroyed', when it refers to people whose worship is that of falsities arising from evil, as being 
cast out, that is to say, cast out of the Church. The fact that casting such falsities out of the Church, and so rooting them out, is meant by their being 'utterly destroyed', is evident in Moses,  </p>
<blockquote>
If 
men of belial<A name="fntext1"></a><A href="#fn1"><sup>a</sup></a> have gone out of your midst, and have urged the inhabitants of their city, saying, Let us go and serve other gods, whom you have not known - if it is true and certain,<A name="fntext2"></a><A href="#fn2"><sup>b</sup></a> that [this] 
abomination has been committed in the midst of you - you shall surely strike the inhabitants of that city with the edge of the sword. You shall utterly destroy it and everyone who is in it, and also 
the beasts in it, with the edge of the sword. You shall bring together all the spoil from it into the middle of the street, and shall burn the city with fire, and all the spoil from it, the whole of 
it, to Jehovah your God, so that it may be a heap forever and not be built ever again. Do it so thoroughly that nothing of what is given to utter destruction sticks in your hand. <a href="http://bible.gospelcom.net/cgi-bin/bible?passage=Deut%2013:13-17&amp;version=ESV&amp;interface=print&amp;showfn=yes&amp;showxref">Deut 13:13-17</a>.  
</blockquote>

<p><b>[2]</b>
The fact that falsity arising from evil is what 'that which is given to utter destruction' means is evident from the details of these verses in the internal sense. 'Cities' which were to be utterly 
destroyed are religious teachings, in this instance false teachings, <a href="2712.htm">2712</a>, <a href="2943.htm">2943</a>, <a href="3216.htm">3216</a>. 'The edge of the sword' with which they were to strike man and beast is truth fighting against and destroying falsity 
that arises from evil, <a href="2799.htm">2799</a>, <a href="4499.htm">4499</a>, <a href="7102.htm">7102</a>, <a href="8294.htm">8294</a>. 'The street' into the middle of which the spoil was to be brought is truth presented by religious teachings and in the contrary sense falsity presented 
by them, <a href="2336.htm">2336</a>. 'Fire' with which the spoil was to be burned along with the city is the evil of self-love, <a href="1297.htm">1297</a>, <a href="2446.htm">2446</a>, <a href="5071.htm">5071</a>, <a href="5215.htm">5215</a>, <a href="6314.htm">6314</a>, <a href="6832.htm">6832</a>, <a href="7324.htm">7324</a>. From all this it is evident that 'utter destruction' 
means being cast out of the Church and being rooted out. Therefore also it was commanded that the nations in the land of Canaan should be utterly destroyed, <a href="http://bible.gospelcom.net/cgi-bin/bible?passage=Deut%207:2,%2024-26&amp;version=ESV&amp;interface=print&amp;showfn=yes&amp;showxref">Deut 7:2, 24-26</a>. For the nations had 
originally constituted the Church in that land, which also was why they had altars and in addition offered sacrifices, <a href="3686.htm">3686</a>, <a href="4447.htm">4447</a>, <a href="4516.htm">4516</a>, <a href="4517.htm">4517</a>, <a href="5136.htm">5136</a>, <a href="6306.htm">6306</a>, <a href="6516.htm">6516</a>, <a href="8054.htm">8054</a>. But when they turned representative 
worship - the worship of the Ancient Church - into idolatrous worship, and in so doing falsified truths and adulterated forms of good, <a href="8317.htm">8317</a>, the command came for them to be given to utter destruction, 
not only people but also cities and what was in them.  </p>
<p></p>
<p><b>[3]</b>
 The command came because everything there represented falsities arising from evil. The cities represented the actual teachings presenting 
falsity; the beasts represented evil affections; the gold and silver of those people represented evils and falsities; and so on with everything else. The worship of the Ancient Church had consisted 
first and foremost in worshipping God in human form, that is, in worshipping the Lord. But then they turned aside from good to evil and began to worship the actual objects that had served to represent 
Him, such as the sun, moon, and stars, also groves and pillars, and God in the form of various kinds of idols. Thus they worshipped external objects separated from anything of an internal nature; 
and this is brought about when the internal man has been closed. What closes the internal man is a life of evil; for good is that through which the Lord flows in and opens the internal man, and therefore 
evil is that which closes this. Once the internal man has been closed truths are turned into falsities; and when they remain they serve solely the evils of self-love and love of the world. Internal 
worship consists first and foremost in acknowledging the Lord, the one and only God, and in acknowledging that He is the source of everything good and true. People in the Church who do not acknowledge 
Him cannot be governed by good, nor thus by truth; and the ones to acknowledge Him are those who possess faith and at the same time lead a good life, but not those who lead a bad life, <a href="8878.htm">8878</a>. Acknowledging 
and worshipping the Lord consists in living according to His commandments, that is, leading the life of faith and of charity, see <a href="8252.htm">8252</a>-<a href="8257.htm">8257</a>. The life of faith lies in doing His commandments in 
a spirit of obedience, and the life of charity lies in doing them out of love.

`Devovebitur': quod significet ejectionem, constat ex significatione `devoveri' cum de illis qui in cultu falsorum ex malo sunt, quod sit ejici, nempe ab Ecclesia; quod ejectio ex Ecclesia, et sic exstirpatio
