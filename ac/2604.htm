<h3 align="center" class="ired">属天的奥秘 第2604节</h3>
<h4 align="center"></h4><p><strong>2604.</strong>通常，外邦人生前若敬拜神像（或雕像、偶像），以之为神明，当其进入来世时，将被带到扮演其所拜之神的某些灵人面前，好帮助他们摆脱错误的观念。与之相处数日以后，他们就会从这些灵人那里被带走。他们若崇拜某些特定的人，有时甚至被带到他们或扮演他们的人面前。比如，很多犹太人被带到亚伯拉罕、雅各、摩西或大卫面前，等其发现他们和其他人一样，也只是凡人，根本不能提供任何帮助时，他们感到十分窘迫，然后被带到与其生命一致的地方。<br />在来世的外邦人当中，非洲人特别受欢迎。因为比起其他任何人，他们更容易接受天堂的良善与真理。他们尤其愿意被称为“顺服的”，而非“虔信的”。他们说，基督徒拥有信的教义，所以可称为“虔信的”，而不是他们自己，不过他们必须接受该教义，或如非洲人所说，能接受该教义才行。</p>

It is usual for Gentiles who adore any god under an image or statue, or any carved thing, to be introduced, on coming into the other life, to certain ones who are in the place of their gods or idols, 
in order that they may put away their phantasies; and when they have been with these for some days, they are taken away from such persons. They who have adored men are also sometimes introduced to them, 
or to others in their stead; as many of the Jews are to Abraham, Jacob, Moses, and David; but when they perceive that these have the same kind of human nature as others have, and can afford them no 
help, they become ashamed, and are taken to their own places in accordance with their life. Among the Gentiles in the other life the Africans are the most beloved, because they receive the goods and 
truths of heaven more easily than others. They especially desire to be called the obedient, but not the faithful. They say that Christians can be called faithful, because they have the doctrine of faith; 
but not they, unless they receive it, or as they say, are able to receive it. </p>

It is common for gentiles who have adored any god in an image or statue, or any carved object, to be introduced on entering the next life to certain spirits who are substituted in place of their gods 
or idols, in order that those gentiles may get rid of their false notions. When they had been with these spirits for several days they were removed from them. Gentiles who have worshipped human beings 
are sometimes even introduced to them or to others substituted in place of them. Many Jews, for example, are introduced to Abraham, Jacob, Moses, or David, but when they realize that these possess only 
the same human qualities as any others and cannot help them at all they are put to shame and are brought, in accord with their own lives, to places of their own. Among the gentiles in the next life 
Africans are liked very much, for they receive the goods and truths of heaven more easily than any others. Above all they wish to be called the obedient, but not the faithful. They say that because 
Christians possess the doctrine of faith, Christians may be called the faithful, but not themselves unless they receive it, or as they say, are able to receive it. </p>

</p><b>2604.</b>
Commune est quod gentiles qui adorarunt aliquem deum sub imagine aut statua, vel aliquod sculptile, dum in alteram vitam veniunt, introducantur ad quosdam qui loco eorum deorum seu idolorum sunt, ex 
causa ut phantasias suas exuant, apud quos cum per aliquot dies fuerunt, inde auferuntur. Qui adorarunt homines, etiam quandoque ad eos vel ad alios qui loco eorum, introducuntur; sicut plures ex Judaeis, 
ad Abrahamum, Jacobum, Mosen, Davidem, sed cum appercipiunt quod tale humanum iis sicut aliis, ac nihil opis ferre possint, pudefiunt, et ad sua loca secundum vitam feruntur.  Inter gentes in altera 
vita diliguntur maxime Africani; hi enim facilius reliquis recipiunt bona et vera caeli: volunt imprimis dici oboedientes, non vero fideles; dicunt quod Christiani, quia fidei doctrinam habent, possint 
fideles nominari, ii vero non, nisi illam recipiant, aut, ut dicunt, recipere possint. </p>
