<h3 align="center" class="ired">属天的奥秘 第4419节</h3>
<h4 align="center"></h4><p><strong>4419.</strong>我身边有一个灵人，他在世时知识渊博，由此以为他比谁都聪明。这种信念使他粘染上这样的邪恶：无论到哪里，他都想掌控一切。他从某个社群被派到我这里，以充当他们的使臣，也就是为了交流（<a href="4403.htm">4403</a>节）；还为了他们能赶走他，因为他很招人烦，总是想凭自己的聪明指挥他们。当他和我在一起时，我蒙允许与他谈论源于自我的聪明。我说，在基督教界，这种聪明如此盛行，以致人们以为一切聪明都源于自我，无一出自神。尽管人们在凭教义信仰谈论时，声称一切良善与真理从天上而来，因而从神性而来，包括一切聪明，因为这聪明涉及理解何为真理与良善。但这个灵人对这些问题无动于衷，于是我说，他最好离开，因为他自己的聪明气场使我感觉很不舒服。但他确信自己比谁都聪明，所以不愿走开。<br />这时，天使指示他源于自我聪明的性质，和源于神性的聪明的性质，并且用各种不同的光来指示，因为在来世，这种事会通过光的变化以奇妙的方式呈为可见。源于自我的聪明通过一种劣质的光来演示，这光类似虚无缥缈的鬼火，周围以黑暗为边界，只从中心传出一点点光来。他又进一步被指示，当某个天使社群观看这光时，它会立刻熄灭，就像虚无缥缈的鬼火在阳光或日光一到来就熄灭一样。之后，他被指示源于神性的聪明的性质，并且也是用光来演示的。这光比正午的阳光还要光辉、明亮，并且传得又远又广，像阳光传到太空那样结束。他还被告知，聪明和智慧从四面八方进入这光的气场，使得真理和良善被几乎没有限制的内视所感知。不过，这一切取决于源自良善的真理的性质。</p>

There was a spirit present with me whose extensive knowledge during his earthly life had occasioned him to believe that he was wiser than anyone else, which had resulted in his contracting the evil that 
wherever he was he wanted to direct everything. He was sent to me by a certain society to serve them as a subject, that is, for communication (n. 4403); and also that they might get rid of him, because 
he was troublesome through his wanting to direct them from his own intelligence. While he was with me it was given me to speak to him about intelligence from self, which I said so greatly prevails 
in the Christian world that it is believed that all intelligence is from this source, and therefore none is from God; although when people are speaking from their doctrinal beliefs they say that everything 
true and good is from heaven, thus from the Divine, consequently all intelligence, for this is of truth and good. But as the spirit would not attend to these things, I said that he would do well 
to withdraw, because the sphere of his intelligence infested me; but being in the persuasion that he was preeminently intelligent, he would not do so. [2] He was then shown by angels what is the 
nature of intelligence from self, and what the nature of intelligence from the Divine, and this by means of lights, for in the other life such things are presented to view in a wonderful manner by means 
of variegations of light. Intelligence from self was shown by a light which appeared as a fatuous light, surrounded by a dark border, and extending but a little distance from its focus; and it was 
further shown that this light is at once extinguished when it is looked at by an angelic society, exactly as is a fatuous light in the light or daytime of the sun. He was then shown what is the quality 
of intelligence from the Divine, and this also by means of a light which was brighter and more full of light than the noonday light of the sun, and which also extended itself to every distance and terminated 
as does the light of the sun in the universe; and it was said that intelligence and wisdom enter from all sides into the sphere of this light, and cause truth and good to be perceived by an 
almost unlimited mental view; but this in accordance with the quality of the truth from good. </p>

There was a spirit present with me who, when he lived in the world, had been very knowledgeable and on that account had believed that he was wiser than everyone else. This belief had led him to become 
infected with the evil of wishing, wherever he was, to take control of everything. He had been sent to me from a certain community to serve as their subordinate, that is, for the purpose of communication, <a href="4403.htm">4403</a>, and also to get rid of him because he proved to be a nuisance on account of his wanting to rule them by the use of his own intelligence. When he was with me I was allowed to talk to him about 
self-derived intelligence. I said that in the Christian world that kind of intelligence prevails to such an extent that all intelligence is believed by people to be self-derived, so that there is 
none which comes from God. They believe this even though they declare, when they speak from the doctrinal teachings of faith, that everything good and true comes from heaven and so from the Divine, including 
all intelligence since this involves understanding what is true and good. But when that spirit refused to pay any attention to these matters I said that it would be better if he went away as 
the sphere of his own intelligence was making me very uncomfortable. But because he was convinced that he was more intelligent than anybody else, he was unwilling to go. </p>

<p><b>[2]</b>
 At that point he was shown 
by angels the nature of self-derived intelligence and the nature of intelligence derived from the Divine. Different kinds of light were used to do this, for matters like these are presented visually 
in the next life in wonderful ways by means of variegations of light. Self-derived intelligence was demonstrated by means of an inferior light which resembled a will-o'-the-wisp that had a band of 
darkness around it, and that spread only a little way from its centre. He was shown in addition that it was extinguished in an instant when some angelic community looked at it, just as a will-o'-the-wisp 
is extinguished on the arrival of the light of the sun or daylight. After this he was shown the nature of intelligence derived from the Divine, again by means of light. This time the light was brighter 
and more luminous than that of the sun at midday, spreading far and wide, and ending in the way sunlight does out in space. He was also told that intelligence and wisdom enter in from every side 
into the sphere of that light and cause truth and good to be perceived with an insight virtually unlimited. But this depends on the nature of the truth stemming from good. </p>

</p><b>4419.</b>
Erat spiritus apud me, qui cum {1} vixit in mundo, multa scivit, et inde credidit quod prae omnibus saperet; a quo id malum contraxerat quod ubicumque esset, omnia vellet regere; is missus ad me 
a quadam societate ut inserviret illis pro subjecto seu pro communicatione, n. 4403, et quoque ut abalienarent illum a se, quippe incommodus per id quod {2} illos ex sua intelligentia regere vellet: 
cum apud me fuit, loqui dabatur cum illo de intelligentia ex proprio, quod illa in orbe Christiano tantum valeat ut credatur quod omnis intelligentia sit inde, et sic nulla ex Deo, tametsi cum ex 
doctrinalibus fidei loquuntur, dicunt quod omne verum et bonum sit e caelo, ita a Divino, proinde omnis intelligentia, nam haec est veri et boni; sed cum ille spiritus ad haec attendere nolebat, dicebam 
quod benefaceret si recederet, quia sphaera ejus intelligentiae infestabat; at {3} quia in persuasione erat quod intelligens prae aliis esset, non volebat; [2] tunc ei ostendebatur ab angelis 
qualis est intelligentia (c)ex proprio et qualis intelligentia a Divino, et hoc per luces; talia enim in altera vita per lucis variegationes mirabiliter sistuntur videnda; </p>
<p>intelligentia ex proprio 
ostendebatur per lumen quod apparebat sicut lumen fatuum, circum quod limbus tenebrosus esset, et praeterea ad parum distantiae (t)se extendebat a foco; ostensum {4} porro quod ilico exstinguatur 
cum inspicitur ab angelica quadam societate, prorsus sicut lumen fatuum ad lucem aut {5} diem solis: </p>
<p>deinde ostensum qualis esset intelligentia a Divino, etiam per lucem, haec erat candida et luminosa 
plus quam meridiana solis, (o)et se extendens ad omnem distantiam, seque {6} terminans sicut lux solis in universo; et dictum quod intelligentia et sapientia intret ab undique in illius lucis 
sphaeram, et faciat ut percipiatur verum et bonum intuitione paene illimitata, sed hoc secundum quale veri ex bono.      @1 dum$      @2 ex causa quia$      @3 sed$      @4 i talis etiam apparet
