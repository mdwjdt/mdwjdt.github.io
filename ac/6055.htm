<h3 align="center" class="ired">属天的奥秘 第6055节</h3>
<h4 align="center"></h4><p><strong>6055.</strong>人若不解人的内层，就不可能知道流注，以及灵魂与身体的相互作用；因为这种相互作用和流注通过这些内层实现。要了解人的内层，就有必要知道既有一个内在人，也有一个外在人，内在人在灵界，外在人在自然界；因此，前者住在天堂的光里，后者住在世界的光里。还有必要知道，内在人与外在人如此不同且相互分离，以致前者因是在先的，更为内在，故离了后者也能持续存在；但后者或外在人因是在后的，更为外在，故离了前者无法持续存在。另外必须知道的是，内在人就是那严格意义上被称为聪明人或理性人的，因为聪明人或理性人住在天堂的光里，这光含有思考力和理解力在里面。而外在人则是那严格来说被称为接受记忆知识者的，因为他里面有记忆知识，这些知识大部分从那些属于被天堂之光光照，从而变得有生气的世界之光的事物那里获得自己的光。</p>

<p align="center"><b>Potts(1905-1910) 6055</b></p><p><b>6055.</b>
He who does not know the interiors of man, cannot know about influx and the interaction of the soul with the body; for the interaction and the influx are effected by means of these interiors. In order 
to know the interiors of man, it is necessary to know that there is an internal man and an external man, and that the internal man is in the spiritual world, and the external man in the natural world; 
thus that the former is in the light of heaven, and the latter in the light of the world. It is also necessary to know that the internal man is so distinct from the external man that the former, being 
prior and interior, can subsist without the latter; but that the latter or external man, being posterior and exterior, cannot subsist without the former. It must be known, further, that the internal 
man is what is properly called the intellectual or rational man, because this is in the light of heaven," in which light are reason and understanding; whereas the external man is what is properly to 
be called that of memory-knowledge, because in him there are memory-knowledges, which for the most part derive their light from those things which are of the light of the world, when this light is enlightened 
and thus vivified by the light of heaven. </p>

<p align="center"><b>Elliott(1983-1999) 6055</b></p><p><b>6055.</b>
Anyone who has no knowledge of the more internal aspects of the human being cannot know about the inflowing of the soul into the body or its interaction with it; for that interaction and inflowing takes 
place through those more internal aspects. To know about these more internal aspects of the human being one should know about the existence of the internal man and of the external man, and that the 
internal man exists in the spiritual world and the external in the natural world, so that the former dwells in the light of heaven, the latter in the light of the world. One also needs to know that 
the internal man is so distinct and separate from the external that, being prior and more internal, it can remain in being without the external, but that the external man, being posterior and more external, 
cannot remain in being without the internal. In addition one should know that the internal man is the one who is called intellectual or rational, using those terms in their proper sense, since 
that man dwells in the light of heaven, a light which holds reason and understanding within it. But the external man is one who must be called, strictly speaking, a knowledge-receiver since known facts 
reside in him, which knowledge derives its light for the most part from things belonging to the inferior light of the world that is brightened and so made living by means of the light of heaven. </p>

Qui non interiora hominis novit, {1} nec scire potest influxum et commercium animae cum corpore, commercium enim et influxus fit per interiora.  Ut interiora hominis sciantur, sciri debet quod internus 
homo sit et externus, et quod internus homo sit in mundo spirituali, et externus in mundo naturali; ita ille in luce caeli, hic in luce mundi; tum quoque sciri oportet quod internus homo tam distinctus 
sit ab externo ut ille quia prior et interior, subsistere possit absque hoc, at quod hic seu externus quia posterior et exterior, non subsistere possit absque illo. Porro sciendum quod internus 
homo sit qui intellectualis aut rationalis in proprio sensu vocatur, {2}quia in luce caeli {3}est, in qua ratio et intellectus; at externus homo est qui proprie scientificus dicendus {4}est, quia in illo 
sunt scientifica, quae quoad maximam partem trahunt suum lumen ab illis quae sunt luminis mundi illustrati et sic vivificati per lucem caeli. @1 i is$ @2 nam illi quia est$ @3 etiam est$ @4 nam illi$ </p>
