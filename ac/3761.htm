<h3 align="center" class="ired">属天的奥秘 第3761节</h3>
<h4 align="center"></h4><p><strong>3761.</strong>“雅各举起脚”表属世层的提升。这从“举起”和“脚”的含义清楚可知：“举起”是指提升；“脚”是指属世层，如下文所述。此处所指的提升就是本章所论述的主题，即从外在真理提升到内在良善。就至高意义而言，所论述的主题是主如何照次序通过从外在真理逐步上升到内在良善而将祂的属世层甚至提升到神性；就代表意义而言，所论述的主题是主在使人重生时，如何照同样的次序将人的属世层变成新的。成年后正经历重生的人照着本章和随后各章的内义所描述的次序发展，这一事实鲜为人知。因为很少有人深思这个问题，如今也很少有人能重生。当仁不复存在，随之信也不复存在之时，教会的末日就到了。正因如此，人们甚至不知道何为信，尽管所有人都声称人因信得救；他们因此更不知道何为仁。他们只知道信和仁这两个术语，却不知道它们的本质是什么，所以我们才说，很少有人能深思人被造为新的或重生所遵循的次序，也很少有人能重生。<br />由于此处论述的主题是属世层，而这属世层由雅各来代表，故经上说的是“雅各举起脚”，而不是说他起来，到了东方之子的地。这两种表述都表示提升，“起来”也具有这种含义（<a href="2401.htm">2401</a>，<a href="2785.htm">2785</a>，<a href="2912.htm">2912</a>，<a href="2927.htm">2927</a>，<a href="3171.htm">3171</a>节）。此处之所以说“雅各举起脚”，是因为这话论及属世层，“脚”表示属世层（<a href="2162.htm">2162</a>，<a href="3147.htm">3147</a>节）。“脚”表示属世层或属世之物是由于与大人的对应关系，大人就是目前各章末尾所论述的主题。在这个大人里面，属于脚部区域的，是那些居于属世之光和少许属灵之光中的人。这也是为何脚下的部位，如脚掌和脚跟，表示最低级的属世之物（参看<a href="259.htm">259</a>节）；以及在圣言中偶尔被提及的鞋表示肉体属世层，它是最最低级的部分（<a href="1748.htm">1748</a>节）。</p>

And Jacob lifted up his feet. That this signifies the elevation of the natural, is evident from the signification of "lifting up," as being elevation; and from the signification of the "feet," as being 
the natural, concerning which in what follows. The elevation here signified is that treated of in this chapter, which is from external truth to internal good. In the supreme sense it is shown how the 
Lord elevated His natural even to the Divine, according to order, by ascending from external truth through the degrees to internal good; and in the representative sense, how the Lord makes new the 
natural of man when He regenerates him, according to a similar order. That the man who is being regenerated in adult age advances according to the order described in the internal sense in this and the 
following chapters, is known to few, for the reason that few reflect upon it, and also that few at this day can be regenerated. For these are the last times of the church, when there is no longer any 
charity, consequently not any faith; and this being the case, it is not even known what faith is, although it is on the lips of all that man is saved by faith. Still less is it known what charity is; 
and as these two are known merely as terms, and are unknown in respect to their essence, it is on this account said that few can reflect upon the order according to which man is made new, or is regenerated, 
and also that few can be regenerated.  [2] Because the natural is here treated of, and this is represented by Jacob, it is not said that he "arose," and went to the land of the sons of the east, 
but that he "lifted up his feet." Both expressions signify elevation (that "arising" has this signification may be seen above, n. 2401, 2785, 2912, 2927, 3171). But the reason why it is here said, 
"he lifted up his feet," is that this is said with respect to the natural; for "feet" signify the natural (n. 2162, 3147). That "feet" signify the natural, or natural things, comes from the correspondence 
with the Grand Man which has been spoken of at the close of the preceding chapters, in which Grand Man they who belong to the province of the feet are those who are in natural light and but little 
in spiritual; consequently the parts under the feet, as the soles and the heels, signify the lowest natural things (see n. 259); and hence the shoe, which is also occasionally mentioned in the Word, 
signifies the corporeal natural which is the ultimate (n. 1748). </p>

<p align="center"><b>Elliott(1983-1999) 3761</b></p><p><b>3761.</b>
'Jacob lifted up his feet' means a raising up of the natural. This is clear from the meaning of 'lifting up' as a raising up, and from the meaning of 'the feet' as the natural, dealt with below. The 
raising up meant here is the subject of the chapter itself, namely a raising up from external truth towards internal good. In the highest sense the subject is how the Lord according to order raised His 
Natural even up to the Divine, rising up step by step from external truth towards internal good. In the representative sense it is how the Lord according to a similar order makes man's natural new when 
regenerating him. The fact that a person who is being regenerated in adult life progresses according to the order described in the internal sense of this chapter and of those that follow is known 
to few. This fact is known to few because few stop to reflect on the matter and also because few at the present day are able to be regenerated; for the last days of the Church have arrived when no charity 
exists any longer, nor consequently any faith. This being so, people do not even know what faith is, even though the assertion 'men is saved by faith' is on everyone's lips; and not knowing this 
they therefore have even less knowledge of what charity is. And since they know no more than the terms faith and charity and have no knowledge of what these are essentially, it has therefore been stated 
that few are able to reflect on the order in accordance with which a person is made new or regenerated, and also that few are able to be regenerated. </p>

<p><b>[2]</b>
 Because the subject here is the natural, 
and the latter is represented by 'Jacob', it is not said that he rose up and went to the land of the sons of the east but that 'he lifted up his feet'. Both these expressions mean a raising up. As regards 
'rising up' haying this meaning, see <a href="2401.htm">2401</a>, <a href="2785.htm">2785</a>, <a href="2912.htm">2912</a>, <a href="2927.htm">2927</a>, <a href="3171.htm">3171</a>; and as regards the expression 'lifting up the feet' which occurs here, this is used in reference to the natural - 'the feet' meaning 
the natural, see <a href="2162.htm">2162</a>, <a href="3147.htm">3147</a>. 'The feet' means the natural or natural things because of their correspondence with the Grand Man - currently the subject at the ends of chapters. In the Grand Man those 
belonging to the province of the feet are those who dwell in natural light and little spiritual light. This also is why the parts beneath the foot - the sole and the heel - mean the lowest natural 
things, see <a href="259.htm">259</a>, and why 'a shoe', which is also mentioned several times in the Word, means the bodily-natural, which is the lowest part of all, <a href="1748.htm">1748</a>. </p>

`Sustulit Jacob pedes suos': quod significat elevationem naturalis, constat a significatione `tollere' quod sit elevatio; et a significatione `pedum' quod sit naturale, de qua sequitur; </p>
<p>elevatio 
quae hic significatur, est de qua in hoc capite agitur, quae est a vero externo ad bonum internum; in sensu supremo, quomodo Dominus Naturale Suum elevavit usque ad Divinum, secundum ordinem, ascendendo 
a vero externo per gradus ad bonum internum; et in sensu repraesentativo, quomodo Dominus naturale hominis cum illum regenerat, secundum similem ordinem, novum facit: quod homo qui {1}in adulta 
aetate regeneratur, secundum ordinem in hoc capite et sequentibus in sensu interno descriptum progrediatur, paucis notum est; causa est, quia pauci super id reflectunt, etiam {2}quia pauci hodie 
possunt regenerari, sunt enim ultima tempora Ecclesiae quando non amplius aliqua charitas, proinde non fides; et quia ita, ne quidem sciunt quid fides, tametsi in omnium ore est quod per fidem salvetur 
homo, inde adhuc minus sciunt quid charitas, et cum haec solum quoad voces modo nota sunt, {3}et quoad essentiam ignota, inde est quod dictum quod pauci possint reflectere super ordinem secundum 
quem homo novus fit seu regeneratur, et quoque quod pauci regenerari possint. [2] Quia hic de naturali agitur et hoc repraesentatur per `Jacobum,' non dicitur quod surrexerit et iverit terram filiorum 
orientis, sed quod sustulerit pedes suos; </p>
<p>utrumque significat elevationem; quod `surgere' significet, videatur n. 2401, 2785, 2912, 2927, 3171; quod hic dicatur `tollere pedes,' est respective 
ad naturale, nam `pedes' significant naturale, videatur n. 2162, 3147; quod `pedes' significent naturale seu naturalia, est ex correspondentia cum Maximo Homine, de qua ad finem capitum nunc, in 
quo, nempe Maximo Homine, illi qui ad provinciam pedum pertinent, sunt qui in naturali luce sunt, et parum in spirituali; inde quoque est quod quae infra pedes sunt, ut `planta et calcaneum,' significent 
infima {4}naturalia, videatur n. 259; et inde `calceus,' qui etiam aliquoties nominatur in Verbo, naturale corporeum, quod ultimum est, n. 1748. @1 i dein$ @2 i ex causa$ @3 at$ @4 naturalis$ </p>
