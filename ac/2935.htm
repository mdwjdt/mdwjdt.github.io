<h3 align="center" class="ired">属天的奥秘 第2935节</h3>
<h4 align="center"></h4><p><strong>2935.</strong>“让他把他那麦比拉洞给我”表他们所具有的信之模糊。这从“洞”和“麦比拉”的含义清楚可知，“洞”是指模糊（参看<a href="2463.htm">2463</a>节）；“麦比拉”是指处于模糊状态的信仰。“洞”表模糊，是因为它是一个充满阴暗的地方；当提及“山洞”时（如创世记<a href="http://39-27.cn/创19.30.htm">19:30</a>，那里提到罗得住在山洞中），它表示良善的模糊；而当提及“田中的麦比拉洞”时，它表示真理的模糊。此处由于经上提到的是“麦比拉洞”，而麦比拉就是那尽头有洞的田地，故此处所表示的是真理的模糊，或也可说，信的模糊。由此也明显可知，“麦比拉”表处于模糊状态的信。<br />那些正经历重生，并变得属灵之人处于真理的最大模糊中。对他们来说，良善的确从主流入进来，但所流入的真理却没有那么多。因此，人所具有的平行和对应关系存在于主与良善之间，而非主与真理之间（参看<a href="1832.htm">1832</a>节）。其主要原因在于，此处所论述的这些人并不知道何为良善；即便知道，他们也不会发自内心相信。只要他们的良善处于模糊状态，他们的真理也会处于模糊状态，因为一切真理皆源于良善。或说得更清楚一些，他们只是隐隐约约知道主是良善本身，并且凡属对主之爱和对邻之仁的一切皆为良善，凡肯定并确认这一点的一切皆为真理。事实上，他们甚至心存质疑，并使得推理涌入进来，反对这些事。只要他们处在这种状态，来自主的真理之光就无法流入进来。他们甚至视主为另外一个人，而不是视祂为神；他们出于某种世俗之爱来思想对祂的爱。他们几乎不知道何为源于对邻之仁的真正情感，甚至不知道何为仁爱，何为邻人。然而，这些都是基本要素。由此明显可知，属灵之人所在的模糊何等之大，这种模糊在重生之前更大，这种状态就是此处所论述的主题。</p>

That he may give me the cave of Machpelah. That this signifies obscurity of faith, is evident from the signification of a "cave," as being what is obscure (see n. 2463); and from the signification of 
"Machpelah," as being faith that is in obscurity. A "cave" signifies obscurity because it is a dark place; when a "cave of a mountain" is spoken of, it then means obscurity of good; but when it is said 
the "cave of the field of Machpelah," it then means obscurity of truth. As it is here said, the "cave of Machpelah," and Machpelah was where there was a field at the end of which was the cave, obscurity 
of truth is here meant, or what is the same, obscurity of faith; and hence also it is plain that "Machpelah" means faith which is in obscurity. [2] Those who are being regenerated and being made 
spiritual are in the greatest obscurity as to truth. Good indeed flows in with them from the Lord, but not so much truth; wherefore between the Lord and the good with man there exist parallelism and 
correspondence, but not with the truth (see n. 1832). The primary cause of this is that those here treated of do not know what good is; and even if they should know, still they do not believe from the 
heart; and so long as good is in obscurity with them, so long is truth, for all truth is from good. But to make this more clear: They know only very obscurely that the Lord is good itself, and that 
all is good which is of love to Him and of charity toward the neighbor, and that all is truth which asserts this and confirms it; indeed they even cherish doubts, and admit reasonings against these things; 
and so long as they are in such a state, the light of truth from the Lord cannot flow in; they even think of the Lord as another man, and not as God; and they think of love to Him from some worldly 
love; what the genuine affection of charity toward the neighbor is they scarcely know, nor indeed what charity is and what the neighbor, when yet these are essentials. Hence it is evident how far 
the spiritual are in obscurity; and they are still more so before regeneration, which is the state here treated of. </p>

'Let him give me the cave of Machpelah [which is his]' means the obscurity of faith [that was theirs]. This is clear from the meaning of 'a cave' as obscurity, dealt with in <a href="2463.htm">2463</a>, and from the meaning 
of 'Machpelah' as faith which is enveloped in obscurity. The reason 'a cave' means obscurity is that it is a place filled with darkness. When reference is made to a mountain cave - as in <a href="http://bible.gospelcom.net/cgi-bin/bible?passage=Gen%2019:30&amp;version=ESV&amp;interface=print&amp;showfn=yes&amp;showxref">Gen 19:30</a>, 
where it is said that Lot lived in a mountain cave - obscurity as regards good is meant, but when reference is made to the cave in the field of Machpelah obscurity as regards truth is meant. Here, because 
the expression 'the cave of Machpelah' is used - Machpelah being the field at the end of which the cave was situated - an obscurity as regards truth, or what amounts to the same, as regards faith 
is meant. From this it is also evident that Machpelah is faith which is enveloped in obscurity. </p>

<p><b>[2]</b>
 Those who are being regenerated and becoming spiritual are very much in obscurity as regards truth. 
With them good from the Lord is indeed flowing in, but truth less so. Consequently a parallelism and correspondence exists with man between the Lord and good, but not between Him and truth, see <a href="1832.htm">1832</a>. 
The chief reason for this is that men do not know what good is, and if they did know they would still not believe it at heart. And as long as their good is enveloped in obscurity, so too is their 
truth, for it is from good that all truth springs. Or to be more explicit, the idea that the Lord is Good itself, and that everything which in itself is a manifestation of love to Him and of charity 
towards the neighbour is good, and that everything which declares and confirms this is truth, they do not know except in an extremely obscure way. Indeed they even entertain doubts, and allow reasonings 
to enter in against those considerations. And as long as their state is such, the light of truth from the Lord cannot flow in. Indeed they think of the Lord as they do of another human being and not 
of Him as God; and they model their idea of love to Him on some worldly kind of love. What genuine affection that stems from charity towards the neighbour is they scarcely know at all, or even what 
charity is and what the neighbour is. Yet these are essentials. From this one may recognize the great obscurity in which spiritual people are and which is all the greater before regeneration has taken 
place, which state is the subject here. </p>

`Det mihi speluncam Machpelae':  quod significet obscuram fidei, constat a significatione `speluncae' quod sit obscurum, de qua n. 2463; et a significatione `Machpelae' quod sit fides quae in obscuro. 
 Quod `spelunca' significet obscurum, inde est quia locus est tenebrosus; cum dicitur `spelunca montis,' ut Gen. xix 30, quod `Lot habitaret in spelunca montis,' tunc est obscurum boni, at cum dicitur 
spelunca agri Machpelae, tunc est obscurum veri; hic quia dicitur spelunca Machpelae, et Machpelah erat ubi ager in cujus fine spelunca, est obscurum veri, seu quod idem, obscurum fidei, inde quoque 
patet quod `Machpelah' sit fides quae in obscuro.  [2] Qui regenerantur, et fiunt spirituales, sunt quam maxime in obscuro quoad verum; bonum quidem a Domino apud illos influit, sed non ita verum, 
quare inter Dominum et bonum apud hominem datur parallelismus et correspondentia, non autem inter verum, videatur n. 1832; causa primaria est quia non sciunt quid bonum, et tametsi scirent, usque non 
ex corde credunt, et quamdiu bonum illis in obscuro est, tamdiu etiam est verum, nam ex bono omne verum; sed clarius, quod Dominus sit ipsum Bonum, et quod omne quod est amoris in Ipsum et charitatis 
erga proximum, sit bonum, et omne quod id asserit et confirmat sit verum, non sciunt nisi perquam obscure; immo etiam dubia fovent, et ratiocinia admittunt contra illa; et quamdiu in tali statu sunt, 
lux veri a Domino influere non potest; immo de Domino ut de homine alio, non ut de Deo cogitant, de amore in Ipsum ex amore quodam mundano; quid affectio genuina charitatis erga proximum vix sciunt, immo 
quid charitas, et quid proximus, cum tamen haec essentialia sunt; inde patet quantum in obscuro sunt spirituales, et adhuc magis ante regenerationem, de quo statu hic agitur. </p>
