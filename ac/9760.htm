<h3 align="center" class="ired">属天的奥秘 第9760节</h3>
<h4 align="center"></h4><p><strong>9760.</strong>“门这边的帷子要十五肘”表住在光中的真理的足够数量。这从“十五”、“帷子”和“翅膀”的含义清楚可知：“十五”是指足够的数量；“帷子”是指真理，如前所述（<a href="9743.htm">9743</a>节）；“翅膀”是指真理住在光中所在的地方。“翅膀”之所以具有这种含义，是因为“翅膀”描述了东边院子的宽度的一部分。事实上，院子的宽度是五十肘，这个宽度的中间是带有宽二十肘的帘子的门（27:16）。这两个部分，在门右边的一部分和在左边的一部分，被称为“翅膀”，每一部分的帷子有十五肘；因此，如前所述，整个宽度是五十肘。所以很明显，一个翅膀朝南，另一个朝北。因此，向南延伸的翅膀的“帷子”表示住在光中的真理，因为“南”是指真理住在光中所在的地方（<a href="9642.htm">9642</a>节）；下一节所提到的向北延伸的翅膀的“帷子”表示住在模糊中的真理，因为“北”是指真理住在模糊中所在的地方（<a href="3708.htm">3708</a>节）。</p>

<p align="center"><b>Potts(1905-1910) 9760</b></p><p><b>9760.</b>
And the hangings for the one wing shall be fifteen cubits. That this signifies truths in light, as many as are sufficient, is evident from the signification of "fifteen," as being as much as is sufficient; 
from the signification of "the hangings," as being truths (of which above, n. 9743); and from the signification of a "wing," as being where truth is in light. That the "wing" has this signification 
is because by the "wing" is signified one side of the breadth of the court toward the corner of the east; for its breadth was fifty cubits, and in the middle of the breadth was the gate, the covering 
of which was twenty cubits (verse 16). The two sides, one to the right of the gate, and the other to the left, are called the "wings," the hangings for each being fifteen cubits; therefore as before 
said the whole breadth was fifty cubits. It is plain therefore that one wing was toward the south, and the other toward the north. Consequently by "the hangings of the wing toward the south" are signified 
truths in light, for "the south" denotes where truth is in light (n. 9642); and by "the hangings of the wing toward the north" (of which in the following verse) are signified truths in obscurity, 
for "the north" denotes where truth is in obscurity (n. 3708). </p>

<p align="center"><b>Elliott(1983-1999) 9760</b></p><p><b>9760.</b>
'And hangings of fifteen cubits shall there be for [one] wing' means the sufficient quantity of truths dwelling in light. This is clear from the meaning of 'fifteen' as a sufficient amount; from the 
meaning of 'the hangings' as truths, dealt with above in <a href="9743.htm">9743</a>; and from the meaning of 'wing' as the place where truths dwell in light. The reason why [this] wing has this meaning is that 'wing' describes 
one part of the breadth of the court on the east side. For the breadth of the court was fifty cubits, in the middle of which was the gate with a screen twenty cubits wide, verse 16. The two parts, 
one to the right of the gate and the other to the left, are called wings, the hangings for each being fifteen cubits, so that the full breadth, as stated, was fifty cubits. It is evident therefore that 
one wing extended towards the south, but the other towards the north, so that by 'the hangings' of the wing extending towards the south truths dwelling in light are meant ('the south' being where 
truth dwells in light, <a href="9642.htm">9642</a>), and by 'the hangings' of the wing extending towards the north, which the next verse refers to, truths dwelling in obscurity are meant ('the north' being where truth dwells 
in obscurity, <a href="3708.htm">3708</a>).  </p>

`Et quindecim cubitorum tapetes alae': quod significet vera in luce quantum satis, constat ex significatione `quindecim' quod sint quantum satis, ex significatione `tapetum' quod sint vera, de qua supra 
n. 9743, et ex significatione `alae' quod sit ubi verum in luce; quod `alae' id sit, est quia per `alam' significatur una pars latitudinis atrii ad angulum orientis {1}; latitudo enim ejus erat quinquaginta 
cubitorum, in media latitudine erat porta, cujus tegumentum erat viginti cubitorum, vers. seq. 16, binae partes, una ad dextram portae et altera ad sinistram {2} vocantur alae tapetes pro 
qualibet quindecim {3} cubitorum; inde tota latitudo, ut dictum, erat {4} quinquaginta cubitorum; patet itaque {5} quod una ala esset versus meridiem, altera (d)autem versus septentrionem; inde per `tapetes 
alae versus meridiem' significantur vera in luce, meridies enim est (d)ubi verum est in luce {6}, n. 9642, et per `tapetes alae versus septentrionem,' de quibus {7} vers. seq., significantur vera 
in obscuro, septentrio (o)enim est ubi verum in obscuro {8}, n. 3708. @1 i versus ortum$ @2 i ejus$ @3 viginti IT$ @4 simul$ @5 inde patet$ @6 lux veri$ @7 i in$ @8 obscurum veri$ </p>
