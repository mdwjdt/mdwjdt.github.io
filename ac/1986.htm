<h3 align="center" class="ired">属天的奥秘 第1986节</h3>
<h4 align="center"></h4><p><strong>1986.</strong>耶和华向披戴人性的主显现（1节）。预言了神性与人性，并人性与神性（4，5）的融合（2，3节）。一切善与真皆来自祂（6节）。因此神性与人类的结合通过祂实现（7节）。天国必是祂的，祂将这国赐给那些信祂的人（8，9节）。但人必须先除去自己的爱和污秽的欲望，从而得以净化；这就是割礼所代表和表示的（10，11节）。因此，结合既在那些教会中人，也在那些教会外的人身上产生（12节）。<br />净化必先到来，否则，不会有任何结合，只有定罪；然而，结合只能在人的污秽中进行（13，14节）。预言人性本质与神性本质的融合，或真与善的结合（15-17节）。经上还提及与那些被信之真理所主导之人的结合；也就是说，由于它将存在于那些属于属天教会的人身上，所以它也会存在于那些属于属灵教会的人身上（18，19节）。后者也会被赋予信之良善（20节）。结论性陈述：这些事必须通过主里面人性本质与神性本质的融合实现（21节）。预言的目的（22节）。这事必如此成就，也的确如此成就了（23-27节）。</p>

Jehovah was manifested to the Lord in His Human (verse 1). Foretelling the union (verses 2, 3); namely, of the Divine with the Human, and of the Human with the Divine (verses 4, 5). And that all good 
and truth is from Him (verse 6). The conjunction of the Divine with the human race would thus be effected through Him (verse 7). And the heavenly kingdom would be His, which He would give to those who 
should have faith in Him (verses 8, 9). But man must first remove his loves and their foul cupidities, and so be purified; this is what was represented and is signified by circumcision (verses 10, 11). 
Thus conjunction would be effected, both with those who are within the church, and with those who are without it (verse 12).  [2] Purification must by all means precede; otherwise there is no conjunction, 
but condemnation; and yet after all the conjunction cannot take place except in man's impurity (verses 13, 14). The union of the Human Essence with the Divine Essence, or of truth with good, 
is foretold (verses 15-17). Also conjunction with those who are in the truths of faith, namely, as with those who are of the celestial church, so with those who are of the spiritual church (verses 18, 
19). And that the latter also would be imbued with the goods of faith (verse 20). In conclusion, these things will be effected through the union in the Lord of the Human Essence with the Divine Essence 
(verse 21). The end of the prediction (verse 22). It was so to be done, and it was so done (verses 23-27). </p>

Jehovah was manifested to the Lord in His Human, verse 1. The union is foretold, verses 2, 3, namely of the Divine with the Human, and of the Human with the Divine, verses 4, 5. From Him comes everything 
good and true, verse 6. So the conjunction of the Divine with the human race was to be effected through Him, verse 7. The heavenly kingdom was to be His, which He would give to those who have faith 
in Him, verses 8, 9. But man must first of all remove [his own] loves<A name="fntext1"></a><A href="#fn1"><sup>a</sup></a> and their foul desires, and so be purified. This is what was represented by and what is meant by circumcision, verses 10, 11. 
Thus conjunction would be effected, both with those inside the Church and with those outside it, verse 12. Purification must definitely come first, otherwise there is no conjunction, only condemnation; 
and yet conjunction cannot come about except in man's impurity, verses 13, 14. The union of the Human Essence with the Divine Essence, that is, of truth with good, is foretold, verses 15-17. Also the 
conjunction with those people who are governed by the truths of faith is referred to; that is to say, as it existed with those who belonged to the celestial Church, so it would exist with those who 
belonged to the spiritual Church, verses 18, 19. The latter as well were to be endowed with goods of faith, verse 20. A concluding statement that these things would be achieved through the union of the 
Human Essence with the Divine Essence in the Lord, verse 21. The end of what is foretold, verse 22. This was the way it would take place and did take place, verses 23-27.

Quod Jehovah manifestatus Domino in Humano Ipsius, vers. 1.  Praedicens unionem, vers. 2, 3, nempe Divini cum Humano, et Humani cum Divino, vers. 4, 5. Et quod ab Ipso omne bonum et verum, vers. 6. 
 (t)Quod ita conjunctio fieret Divini cum humano genere per ipsum, vers. 7.  Et quod regnum caeleste Ipsius foret, quod daturus illis qui fidem in Ipsum haberent, vers. 8, 9.  Sed quod homo prius removebit 
amores et eorum {1} foedas cupiditates, ac ita purificabitur, hoc est quod repraesentatum est {2} et significatur per circumcisionem, vers. 10, 11.  Ita conjunctio fieret, tam cum illis qui intra 
Ecclesiam quam cum illis qui extra, vers. 12.  Quod omnino purificatio praecedet, aliter nulla conjunctio sed damnatio; et quod conjunctio usque non existere possit nisi in impuro hominis, vers. 13, 
14. Praedicitur Humanae Essentiae unio cum Divina seu veri cum bono, vers. 15-17.  Tum conjunctio cum illis qui in veris fidei, nempe sicut cum illis qui ab Ecclesia caelesti, ita cum illis qui ab Ecclesia 
spirituali, vers. 18, 19.  Et quod hi quoque imbuerentur bonis fidei, vers. 20.  Conclusio, quod haec per unionem Essentiae Humanae cum Divina in Domino, vers. 21. Finis praedictionis, vers. 22. 
 Quod ita fieret et ita factum sit, vers. 23-27. 	@1 spurcos: et ejus.$ 	@2 repraesentatur.$ </p>
