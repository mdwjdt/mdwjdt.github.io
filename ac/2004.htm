<h3 align="center" class="ired">属天的奥秘 第2004节</h3>
<h4 align="center"></h4><p><strong>2004.</strong>“你要作多族之父”表人性本质与神性本质的融合。这一点通过解读个别句子的内义难以说明，除非以一种笼统的概念看待它们。内义的性质往往就是这样，这时，它可谓更普遍，因为更遥远。这种近似的含义通过对个别句子的解读呈现出来：即一切真理和一切良善皆出自主，因为如我们稍后所看到的，“父”在此表来自祂，即来自主；“多”表真理，“族”表由此衍生的良善。但由于后者，也就是说，真理与良善是主借以将人性本质与神性本质融合的工具，所以更普遍、更遥远的含义就通过这种解读产生了。这就是天使理解这些话的方式，与此同时，他们还察觉到一种相互融合，也就是主的神性本质与人性本质，并人性本质与神性的相互融合。因为如前所述，“我的约是同你立的”表神性本质与人性本质的融合，所以随后那句话就表示人性本质与神性本质的融合。<br />结合是相互产生的，这是一个至今尚未透露的奥秘，并且这个奥秘很难解释清楚。因为至今没人知道何为流注，不了解流注，就不可能对相互融合形成任何概念。不过，这个问题通过发生在人身上的流注可在某种程度上来说明，因为人也有一个相互结合。生命不断从主经由人的内在（刚才论述过，<a href="1999.htm">1999</a>节）流入人的理性，然后经由这理性流入人的外在，甚至流入他所拥有的知识和认知。这生命不仅使它们适合接受生命，还将它们整理得井然有序，从而使此人能思考，最终变得理性。这就是主与人的结合，没有该结合，人根本无法思考，更不用说变得理性了。谁都能由以下事实清楚看出这一点：即人的思维里面存在数不清的科学和分析艺术的奥秘，数量多到甚至永远不可能将它们解读个遍。这类奥秘决不会通过感官知觉，或外在人流入，而只通过内在人流入。然而，从人这方面来说，他凭知识和认知逐渐触及这从主所流入的生命，并由此反过来使自己去结合。<br />至于主的神性本质与人性本质，并人性本质与神性本质的融合，这融合无限超越人与主之间的结合。因为主的内在是耶和华自己，因而是生命本身；而人的内在并非主，因而也不是生命，只是生命的接受者。主与耶和华的关系是融合，而人与主的关系不是融合，而是结合。主凭自己的能力将祂自己与耶和华融合，并因此变成公义；而人使自己去结合决非凭自己的能力，而是凭主的能力。既如此，那么正是主将人与祂自己结合起来。在约翰福音中，主所指的就是这种相互结合，主将自己的归于父，将父的归于自己：<br />耶稣说，信我的，不是信我，乃是信那差我来的。人看见我，就是看见那差我来的。我到世上来，乃是光，叫凡信我的，不住在黑暗里。（约翰福音<a href="http://39-27.cn/约12.44.htm">12:44</a>-<a href="http://39-27.cn/约12.46.htm">46</a>）<br />这些话隐藏着极深的奥秘，事实上，这奥秘涉及良善与真理，并真理与良善的融合，或也可说，涉及神性本质与人性本质，并人性本质与神性本质的融合。因此，祂声称“信我的，不是信我，乃是信那差我来的”，稍后又声称“凡信我的”，这两句话之间又有一句涉及那融合的话，即祂说：“人看见我，就是看见那差我来的”。<br />同一福音书：<br />我对你们所说的话，不是凭着自己说的，乃是住在我里面的父做他自己的事。你们当信我，我在父里面，父在我里面。我实实在在地告诉你们：我所做的事，信我的人也要做。（约翰福音<a href="http://39-27.cn/约14.10.htm">14:10</a>-<a href="http://39-27.cn/约14.12.htm">12</a>）<br />这些话同样隐藏着奥秘，也就是说，这些奥秘涉及良善与真理，并真理与良善的融合，或也可说，涉及神性本质与人性本质，并人性本质与神性本质的融合。因此，祂声称“我对你们所说的话，不是凭着自己说的，乃是住在我里面的父做他自己的事”，稍后声称“我所做的事”，两句话之间同样又有一句涉及融合的话，即祂说：“我在父里面，父在我里面”。这就是很多人所谈论的神秘融合。<br />由此明显可知，主并非另外一个人，而是父，尽管祂谈起父时，如同谈起另外一个人。祂这样做的原因就是那将要实现并已实现的相互融合。因为祂多次公开声明祂与父为一，如下面引用的经文：<br />人看见我，就是看见那差我来的。（约翰福音<a href="http://39-27.cn/约12.45.htm">12:45</a>）<br />还有：<br />乃是住在我里面的父做他自己的事。你们当信我，我在父里面，父在我里面。（约翰福音<a href="http://39-27.cn/约14.10.htm">14:10</a>，<a href="http://39-27.cn/约14.11.htm">11</a>）<br />同一福音书：<br />你若是认识我，也就认识我的父。（约翰福音<a href="http://39-27.cn/约8.19.htm">8:19</a>）<br /><br />你们若认识我，也就认识我的父。从今以后，你们认识祂，并且已经看见祂。腓力对他说，将父显给我们看。耶稣对他说，腓力，我与你们同在这样长久，你还不认识我吗？人看见了我，就是看见了父，你怎么说将父显给我们看呢？我在父里面，父在我里面，你不信吗？（约翰福音<a href="http://39-27.cn/约14.7.htm">14:7</a>-<a href="http://39-27.cn/约14.10.htm">10</a>）<br /><br />我与父原为一。（约翰福音<a href="http://39-27.cn/约10.30.htm">10:30</a>）<br />这就是为何在天堂，他们不认识父，只认识主，因为父就在主里面，主与父为一；他们看见了祂，就看见了父，如祂自己所说的（参看<a href="15.htm">15</a>节）。</p>

<p align="center"><b>Potts(1905-1910) 2004</b></p><p><b>2004.</b>
And thou shalt be for a father of a multitude of nations. That this signifies the union of the Human Essence with the Divine Essence, cannot be seen so well from an unfolding of the several words in 
the internal sense, unless they are viewed in a kind of general idea, by which this sense is presented, for such is sometimes the nature of the internal sense, and when it is so, it may be called more 
universal, because more remote. From the explication of the several words there results this proximate sense: that all truth and all good come from the Lord, for, as we shall see presently, the expression 
"father" here signifies from Him, that is, from the Lord; "multitude" signifies truth; and "of nations" signifies the good thence derived. But because these-that is, truths and goods-are the means 
through which the Lord united the Human Essence to the Divine Essence, there arises from this that more universal and more remote sense. The angels perceive these words in this way, and have at the 
same time a perception of reciprocal union, namely, that of the Lord's Divine Essence with the Human Essence and of the Human Essence with the Divine Essence; for, as before said, "I, My covenant is 
with thee" signifies the union of the Divine Essence with the Human Essence; and consequently the words now under consideration signify the union of the Human Essence with the Divine Essence.  [2] That 
the union was effected reciprocally, is an arcanum which has not yet been disclosed, and it is such an arcanum as can scarcely be explained to the apprehension; for as yet no one knows what influx 
is, and without a knowledge of influx no idea can possibly be formed in regard to what is reciprocal union. Yet this may in some measure be illustrated from the influx in the case of man, for with man 
too there is a reciprocal conjunction. From the Lord, through man's internal (treated of just above, n. 1999), life continually flows into man's rational, and through this into his external, and in fact 
into his knowledges [scientifica et cognitiones], and this life not only adapts them to receive the life, but also disposes them into order, and so enables the man to think, and finally to be rational. 
Such is the conjunction of the Lord with man, without which man could not think at all, still less be rational, as everyone can see from the fact that there are in man's thoughts numberless arcana 
of science and analytical art-too numerous to render their exploration possible to all eternity-and which do by no means flow in through the senses or through the external man, but through the internal. 
Man however, on his part, by means of knowledges [scientifica et cognitiones], advances to meet this life which is from the Lord, and thereby reciprocally conjoins himself.  [3] But as regards 
the union of the Lord's Divine Essence with His Human Essence, and of His Human Essence with His Divine Essence, this infinitely transcends the reciprocal conjunction between man and the Lord, for the 
Lord's internal was Jehovah Himself and therefore was life itself; whereas man's internal is not the Lord, and therefore is not life but a recipient of life. Between the Lord and Jehovah there was union, 
but between man and the Lord there is not union, but conjunction. The Lord united Himself to Jehovah by His own power, and He therefore also became Righteousness; whereas man by no means conjoins 
himself by his own power, but by the power of the Lord; so that the Lord conjoins man with Himself. It is this reciprocal union that is meant by the Lord, where He attributes what is His own to the Father, 
and what is the Father's to Himself, as in John: </p>
<p>     Jesus said, He that believeth on Me, believeth not on Me, but on Him that sent Me: I am come a light into the world, that whosoever believeth 
in Me may not abide in the darkness (John 12:44-46), in which words lie hidden the deepest arcana-arcana concerning the union of good with truth, and of truth with good; or what is the same, concerning 
the union of the Divine Essence with the Human Essence, and of the Human Essence with the Divine Essence; and therefore the Lord says, "He that believeth on Me, believeth not on Me, but on Him that 
sent Me;" and then almost immediately adds, "He that believeth on Me;" with words between that refer to this union, namely, "he that seeth Me seeth Him that sent Me."  [4] Again in the same gospel: </p>
<p> 
    The words that I speak unto you I speak not from Myself; the Father that abideth in Me, He doeth the works. Believe Me that I am in the Father, and the Father in Me. Verily I say unto you, He 
that believeth in Me, the works that I do shall he do also (John 14:10-12). In these words are contained the same arcana, namely, those concerning the union of good with truth, and of truth with good; 
or what is the same, of the Lord's Divine Essence with His Human Essence, and of His Human Essence with His Divine Essence; and He therefore says, "The words that I speak unto you I speak not from 
Myself; the Father who is in Me doeth the works;" and then He almost immediately adds, "the works that I do;" and here, as before, there are intervening words concerning the union, which declare, "I am 
in the Father, and the Father in Me." This is the mystical union of which many speak.  [5] From all this it is evident that the Lord was not another than the Father, although He spoke of the Father 
as of another, and this on account of the reciprocal unition that was to be effected and that was effected; for He so many times openly says that He is one with the Father, as in the passages just cited: 
"He that seeth Me seeth Him that sent Me" (John 12:45) also, "The Father that abideth in Me; believe Me that I am in the Father, and the Father in Me" (John 14:10, 11); and in the same, "If ye had 
known Me, ye would have known My Father also" (John 8:19); and again, "If ye have known Me, ye have known My Father also; and from henceforth ye have known Him, and have seen Him; Philip saith unto 
Him, Lord, show us the Father; Jesus saith unto him, Am I so long time with you, and hast thou not known Me, Philip? He that hath seen Me hath seen the Father; how sayest thou then, Show us the Father? 
Believest thou not that I am in the Father and the Father in Me?" (John 14:7-10) and again, "I and the Father are one" (John 10:30). Hence it is that in heaven they know no other Father than the Lord, 
because the Father is in Him, and He is one with the Father; and when they see Him, they see the Father, as He Himself says (see n. 15). </p>

<p align="center"><b>Elliott(1983-1999) 2004</b></p><p><b>2004.</b>
'And you will be the father of a multitude of nations' means union of the Human Essence with the Divine Essence. This cannot be shown so easily from an explanation of individual expressions in the internal 
sense unless they are seen within a general overall picture by which this sense is presented. This is frequently the case with the internal sense, and when it is it may be called more universal 
because it is more remote. From an explanation of individual expressions this proximate sense is the result - that everything true and everything good comes from the Lord, for as will be discussed belong 
'father' means that which comes from Him, that is, from the Lord, 'multitude' means truth, and 'of nations' resulting good. But because the latter, that is to say, truths and goods, are the means 
by which the Lord united the Human Essence to the Divine Essence, that more universal and more remote sense emerges from such an explanation. This is the way in which angels perceive these words; and 
at one and the same time they perceive a reciprocal union, namely that of the Lord's Divine Essence with the Human Essence, and of the Human Essence with the Divine Essence. For as has been stated, 'As 
for Me, My covenant is with you' means union of the Divine Essence with the Human Essence, the words that follow consequently meaning that of the Human Essence with the Divine Essence. </p>
<p></p>
<p><b>[2]</b>
 It is 
an arcanum not yet disclosed that union was accomplished reciprocally, an arcanum that can hardly be explained intelligibly, for as yet the nature of influx has not been known to anyone, and without 
a knowledge of influx no idea can possibly be gained of what reciprocal union is. It is possible to shed light to some extent on the matter however from influx as it takes place with man, for with man 
too reciprocal conjunction exists. From the Lord by way of man's internal, which is dealt with just above in <a href="1999.htm">1999</a>, life is flowing in constantly into man's rational, and by way of the rational into the 
external and even into the facts and cognitions he has. These it not only adapts to receive life but also sets them in order and so enables man to think and ultimately to be rational. Such is the conjunction 
of the Lord with man, and without it man would never be able to think, let alone be rational. This may become clear to anyone from the fact that present within a person's thought there are 
countless arcana belonging to the science and art of analysis, so countless that even to all eternity it is not possible to explore them thoroughly. Such arcana do not flow in through the senses or the 
external man, but through the internal man. Man for his part however, through facts and cognitions, goes to meet this life flowing from the Lord, and in so doing joins himself reciprocally.  </p>
<p></p>
<p><b>[3]</b>
But as for the union of the Lord's Divine Essence with His Human Essence, and of the Human Essence with the Divine Essence, this was infinitely superior, for the Lord's Internal was Jehovah Himself, and 
so Life itself, whereas man's internal is not the Lord, and so not life but a recipient of life. The Lord's relationship with Jehovah was union, whereas that of man with the Lord is not union but conjunction. 
The Lord united Himself to Jehovah by His own power and on that account became righteousness as well, whereas man in no way joins himself to Him by his own power but by the Lord's. This being 
so, it is the Lord who joins man to Himself. Such reciprocal union is what the Lord means where He attributes what is His own to the Father, and what is the Father's to Himself, as in John, </p>
<blockquote>
Jesus 
said, He who believes in Me believes not in Me but in Him who sent Me. He who sees Me sees Him who sent Me I have come as light into the world in order that everyone who believes in Me may not remain 
in darkness. <a href="http://bible.gospelcom.net/cgi-bin/bible?passage=John%2012:44-46&amp;version=ESV&amp;interface=print&amp;showfn=yes&amp;showxref">John 12:44-46</a>. 
</blockquote>
<p>These words conceal very deep arcana - arcana in fact regarding the union of good with truth, and of truth with good, or what amounts to the same, regarding the union 
of the Divine Essence with the Human Essence, and of Human Essence with Divine Essence. Hence His declaration, 'He who believes in Me believes not in Me but in Him who sent Me', and shortly after, 'He 
who believes in Me', in between which two statements comes another concerning that union in which He says, 'He who sees Me sees Him who sent Me'. </p>
<p></p>
<p><b>[4]</b>
 In the same gospel, </p>
<blockquote>
The words that I speak 
to you I do not speak from Myself; the Father who dwells within Me He does the works Believe Me that I am in the Father and the Father in Me. Truly I say to you, He who believes in Me [will also do] 
the works that I do. <a href="http://bible.gospelcom.net/cgi-bin/bible?passage=John%2014:10-12&amp;version=ESV&amp;interface=print&amp;showfn=yes&amp;showxref">John 14:10-12</a>. 
</blockquote>
<p>These words hold the same arcana within them, that is to say, those relating to the union of good with truth, and of truth with good; or what amounts to the same, 
of the Lord's Divine Essence with the Human Essence, and of the Human Essence with the Divine Essence. Hence His declaration, 'The words that I speak to you I do not speak from Myself; the Father who 
is within Me, He does the works', and shortly afterwards, 'The works that I do', in between which two statements likewise comes another concerning the union, in which He says, 'I am in the Father and 
the Father in Me'. This is the mystical union that many people speak about. </p>
<p></p>
<p><b>[5]</b>
 From this it is clear that He was not someone other than the Father even though He spoke of the Father as though He 
were someone other. The reason for His doing so was the reciprocal union that was going to be accomplished and was accomplished, for He openly states so many times that He is one with the Father, as 
He does in the places just quoted - </p>
<blockquote>
 He who sees Me sees Him who sent Me. <a href="http://bible.gospelcom.net/cgi-bin/bible?passage=John%2012:45&amp;version=ESV&amp;interface=print&amp;showfn=yes&amp;showxref">John 12:45</a>. 
</blockquote>
<p>Also, </p>
<blockquote>
The Father who dwells within Me; believe Me that I am in the Father and the Father in Me. <a href="http://bible.gospelcom.net/cgi-bin/bible?passage=John%2014:10,%2011&amp;version=ESV&amp;interface=print&amp;showfn=yes&amp;showxref">John 14:10, 11</a>. 
</blockquote>
<p>And in the same gospel, </p>
<blockquote>
If you knew Me you would know my Father also. <a href="http://bible.gospelcom.net/cgi-bin/bible?passage=John%208:19&amp;version=ESV&amp;interface=print&amp;showfn=yes&amp;showxref">John 8:19</a>. 
</blockquote>
<p>In the same gospel, </p>
<blockquote>
If you know Me you know My Father also. And from now on you know Him and have seen 
Him. Philip said to Him, Show us the Father. Jesus said to him, Have I been with you so long and yet you do not know Me, Philip? He who has seen Me has seen the Father. So why do you say, Show us the 
Father? Do you not believe that I am in the Father and the Father is in Me? <a href="http://bible.gospelcom.net/cgi-bin/bible?passage=John%2014:7-10&amp;version=ESV&amp;interface=print&amp;showfn=yes&amp;showxref">John 14:7-10</a>. 
</blockquote>
<p>And in the same gospel, </p>
<blockquote>
I and the Father are one. <a href="http://bible.gospelcom.net/cgi-bin/bible?passage=John%2010:30&amp;version=ESV&amp;interface=print&amp;showfn=yes&amp;showxref">John 10:30</a>. 
</blockquote>
<p>This is why in heaven they know no other 
Father than the Lord since the Father is within Him, and He is one with the Father; and when they see Him they see the Father, as He Himself has said; see <a href="15.htm">15</a>. </p>

`Et eris in patrem multitudinis gentium': quod significet Humanae Essentiae unionem cum Divina, non ita constare potest (c)ab explicatione singularum vocum in sensu interno, nisi spectentur communi 
quadam idea, qua sistitur hic sensus; sensus internus aliquoties talis est: qui cum talis, dici potest universalior quia remotior; ab explicatione singularum vocum, hic proximus sensus resultat quod a 
Domino omne verum et omne bonum, nam, ut dicetur infra, `pater' significat ab Ipso, hoc est, a Domino, `multitudo' verum, et `gentium' inde bonum; at haec, nempe vera et bona, quia sunt per quae Dominus 
univit Humanam Essentiam Divinae, sensus ille universalior et remotior, inde exsurgit {1}; angeli ita percipiunt haec verba; et simul tunc reciprocam unionem, nempe Essentiae Divinae Domini cum Humana, 
et Humanae cum Divina; nam ut dictum `Ego foedus Meum cum te' significat Essentiae Divinae unionem cum Humana, haec inde, Essentiae Humanae cum Divina.  [2] Quod unitio reciproce facta sit, est 
arcanum quod nondum detectum est, et tale ut vix ad captum (t)exponi possit, nam nondum alicui notum est qualis est {2} influxus; et absque cognitione influxus, nusquam aliqua idea potest capi quid unitio 
reciproca; at illustrari aliquatenus potest ab influxu apud hominem, nam etiam apud hominem est conjunctio reciproca: a Domino per internum hominis, de quo mox supra n. 1999, continue influit vita 
in hominis rationale et per hoc in externum et quidem in ejus scientifica et cognitiones, et non solum adaptat illa ad recipiendum vitam sed etiam in ordinem disponit, et sic facit ut homo cogitare 
possit, et denique ut rationalis sit; haec conjunctio est Domini cum homine, sine qua nusquam homo posset cogitare, minus rationalis esse; quod unicuique constare potest ex eo quod in cogitatione hominis 
innumerabilia arcana scientiae et artis analyticae sint, et tam innumerabilia ut in aeternum nequeant explorari, (m)quae nusquam influunt per sensus seu per externum hominem, sed per internum; homo 
autem a sua parte obviam it huic vitae quae a Domino, per scientifica et cognitiones, et sic reciproce se conjungit.  [3] Sed quod unionem Divinae Essentiae Domini cum Humana Ipsius, et Humanae cum 
Divina, attinet, haec infinite ascendit; nam Internum Domini fuit Ipse Jehovah, ita Ipsa Vita; internum autem hominis non est Dominus, ita nec vita sed recipiens vitae: Domini cum Jehovah fuit unio, at 
hominis cum Domino non est unio sed conjunctio; Dominus ex propria potentia univit se Jehovae, quare etiam justitia factus, homo autem nusquam propria potentia sed Domini, sic ut Dominus Sibi conjungat 
hominem: reciproca illa unio est quae a Domino intelligitur, ubi Sua tribuit Patri, et quae Patris Sibi, ut apud Johannem, 	Jesus dixit, Qui credit in Me, non credit in Me, sed in Ipsum Qui misit 
Me; [qui videt Me videt Ipsum Qui misit Me;] Ego lux in mundum veni, ut omnis qui credit in Me, in tenebris non maneat, xii 44-46; </p>
<p>in quibus verbis arcanissima illa latent, et quidem de unione boni 
cum vero, et veri cum bono, seu quod idem {3}, de unione Essentiae Divinae cum, Humanae cum Divina; quare dicit,' qui credit in Me non credit in Me sed in Ipsum Qui misit me,' et mox, `qui credit in Me'; 
interveniente de unione illa, ita, `qui videt Me, videt Ipsum Qui misit Me.' [4] Apud eundem, 	Verba, quae Ego loquor vobis, a Me Ipso non loquor, Pater Qui in Me manet, Ille facit opera: credite 
Mihi, quod Ego in Patre et Pater in Me:... amen dico vobis, qui credit in Me, opera quae Ego facio, [ille etiam faciet,] xiv 1012; </p>
<p>in his verbis eadem arcana sunt, nempe de unione boni cum vero, et 
veri cum bono, seu quod idem, Divinae Essentiae Domini cum Humana et Humanae cum Divina; quare dicit, `verba quae Ego loquor vobis,: </p>
<p>Me IPso non loquor; Pater Qui in Me, facit opera'; et mox, `opera 
quae Ego facio,' interveniente de unione hic {4} similiter, ita, Ego in Patre, et Pater in Me {5}: haec est unio mystica de qua plures loquuntur.  [5] Exinde constat quod non alius fuerit a Patre, tametsi 
de Patre sicut de alio locutus, et hoc ob causam reciprocae unitionis quae fieret, et quae {6} facta; nam aperte toties dicit quod unus sit cum Patre, ut in locis citatis, 	Qui videt Me, videt Illum 
Qui misit Me, Joh. xii 45; </p>
<p>tum, 	Pater, Qui in Me manet,... credite Mihi, quod Ego in Patre et Pater in Me, Joh. xiv 10, 11; </p>
<p>et apud eundem, 	Si Me nossetis, (x)etiam Patrem Meum nossetis, viii 
19;  apud eundem, 	Si cognovistis Me, etiam Patrem Meum cognovistis,' et ab hinc cognovistis Illum, et vidistis Illum.  Dicit Illi {7} Philippus, Monstra nobis Patrem; dicit illi Jesus, Tantum tempus 
vobiscum sum, et non nosti Me, Philippe? qui vidit Me, vidit Patrem, quomodo ergo tu dicis, monstra nobis Patrem? nonne credis, quod Ego in Patre et Pater in Me sit? xiv 710; </p>
<p>et apud eundem, 	Ego 
et Pater unum sumus, x 30. Inde est quod in caelo non alium sciant Patrem quam Dominum, quia in Ipso Pater, et unus cum Patre, et cum Ipsum vident, Patrem vident, sicut Ipse dixit, (x)videatur n.
