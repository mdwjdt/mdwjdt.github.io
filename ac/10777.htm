<h3 align="center" class="ired">属天的奥秘 第10777节</h3>
<h4 align="center"></h4><p><strong>10777</strong>.坏人的图谋之所以得逞，是因为按照秩序，每个人都要做他出于理性和自由所做的事。因此，除非让一个人照着他的理性在自由中行动，因而除非借助理性自由进行的图谋得逞，否则这个人不可能处于一种适当的心智状态，以接受永生。因为当人们处于自由之中，并且其理性被光照时，这种生命才被逐渐灌输进来。良善无法被强加于任何人，因为任何东西若被强加于一个人，都不会固定下来；这东西不是他的。唯一能变成人自己的东西就是那些在自由中所做的事；因为在自由中所做的事是源于意愿的事，而意愿才是这个人真实的自己。因此，一个人若不被保持在做坏事的自由中，就不可能从主那里得到良善。</p>

<p align="center"><b>Potts(1905-1910) 10777</b></p><p><b>10777.</b>
The reason why the evil succeed in accordance with their skill, is that it is according to order that everyone should do what he does from reason and also from freedom; and therefore unless it were left 
to a man to act in freedom according to his reason, and thus also unless the consequent arts succeeded, the man could not possibly be disposed to receive eternal life, because this is instilled when 
the man is in freedom, and his reason is enlightened. For no one can be compelled to good, because nothing compulsory cleaves to the man, for it is not his. That becomes the man's own which is done 
from freedom, for that which is from the will is done from freedom, and the will is the man himself; and therefore unless a man is kept in the freedom to do evil also, good from the Lord cannot be provided 
for him. </p>

<p align="center"><b>Elliott(1983-1999) 10777</b></p><p><b>10777.</b>
The reason why the designs of bad people meet with success is that proper order requires all people to use their reason when they do what they do, and also to act in freedom. Therefore unless a person 
were left to act in accord with his reason and in freedom, and so unless the designs carried out with the aid of reason and in freedom met with success, no one would ever be in a proper state of mind 
to receive eternal life. For this life is instilled when people are in freedom and their reason is enlightened. Goodness cannot be forced on anyone, because nothing remains fixed if it has been forced 
on a person; it is not his. The only things that become a person's own are those done in freedom; for things done in freedom are those that spring from the will, and the will is the person's true self. 
Therefore unless a person is kept in freedom to do even what is bad he cannot be provided with good from the Lord.  </p>

</p><b>10777.</b>
Quod succedat malis secundum artes, est causa quia ex ordine est ut quisque ex ratione agat quod agit, et quoque ex libero, quapropter nisi relictum foret homini agere secundum ejus rationem ex libero, 
et sic quoque nisi artes quae inde sunt succederent, homo nullatenus posset disponi ad recipiendum vitam aeternam, haec enim insinuatur cum homo est in libero et ratio ejus illustratur; nemo namque 
cogi potest ad bonum, quia omne coactum non inhaeret, non enim est ipsius; id ipsius hominis fit quod ex libero fit, nam ex libero fit quod ex voluntate, et voluntas est ipse homo; {1} quapropter nisi 
{2}homo teneatur in libero etiam facere malum, non ei provideri potest bonum a Domino. @1 i hoc inhaeret, et fit hominis; relinquere homini facere ex libero vocatur permittere,$ @2 permittatur homini 
ex suo libero$ </p>
