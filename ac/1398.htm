<h3 align="center" class="ired">属天的奥秘 第1398节</h3>
<h4 align="center"></h4><p><strong>1398.</strong>我身边曾有很多不善的灵人。一位天使来了，我发现这些灵人无法忍受他的临在。他走得越近，他们就退得越远。这使我惊讶万分，但我得知，这些灵人无法呆在他所具有的气场中。由此并其它经验明显可知，一位天使能驱赶成千上万的恶灵，因为他们无法承受相爱的气场。然而，我发觉这位天使的气场已通过与其他天使联结而有所缓和。若未经调节，他们全都会落荒而逃。</p><br />

<p><strong>[NCE]1398.</strong> There were quite a few spirits around me who were not good. An angel came, and I saw that the spirits could not bear his presence, since the nearer he came, the farther away they went. I was surprised but was able to see that they could not linger in the aura that he carried with him. This too showed me, as other experiences have done, that one angel can drive away tens of thousands of evil spirits, since evil spirits cannot abide an atmosphere of mutual love.<br />Still, I could tell that his aura was being moderated by his associations with others. If it had not been, all the spirits would immediately have scattered.<br />This once again shows clearly what kind of perception exists in the other life, and it shows how people join together and separate in response to their perceptions. </p>

There were a number of spirits about me who were not good. An angel came, and I saw that the spirits could not endure his presence; for, as he came nearer, they fell back more and more. I wondered at 
this, but it was given me to know that the spirits could not stay in the sphere which he had with him. From this, and also from other experience, it has been made evident that one angel can put to flight 
myriads of evil spirits, for they cannot endure the sphere of mutual love. And yet it was perceived that the sphere of the angel had been tempered by means of others who were associated with him: 
if it had not been tempered, they would all have been dissipated. From all this it is evident what a perfect perception exists in the other life; and how those who are there are associated together, 
and also separated from fellowship, in accordance with the perceptions.  </p>

There were once many spirits around me who were far from good. An angel came, and I saw that the spirits could not endure his presence, for they backed further and further away as he drew nearer. This 
amazed me, but I was given to see that the spirits could not abide the sphere he brought with him. From this it was also clear, and from other experience as well, that one angel is able to drive away 
tens of thousands of evil spirits, for they cannot withstand the sphere of mutual love. Nevertheless I perceived that this angel's sphere had been tempered through links with other angels. If it had 
not been modified every one of those spirits would have been put to flight. This shows what kind of perception exists in the next life, and how spirits are joined together into communities or withheld 
from such associations, in accordance with perceptions. </p>

<p align="center"><b>Latin(1748-1756) 1398</b>
</p><b>1398.</b>
Erant plures spiritus circum me qui non boni; venit angelus, et vidi quod spiritus praesentiam ejus non sufferre possent, nam se elongabant magis et magis quo propius accessit, quod mirabar; sed datum 
scire quod spiritus non possent apud sphaeram quam secum habuit, morari; inde quoque constabat, sicut etiam ab alia experientia, quod unus angelus possit myriades spirituum malorum abigere, num non 
sustinent sphaeram amoris mutui: sed usque perceptum quod sphaera ejus esset temperata per consociationes aliorum; si non temperata, omnes dissipati fuissent.  Inde quoque patet qualis perceptio datur 
in altera vita, et quomodo consociantur et quomodo dissociantur secundum perceptiones. </p>
