<p><strong>[NCE]6.</strong> <a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_6/bible_king-james-version_genesis_1_1-31" target=_top>Genesis 1</a><br />1. In the beginning, God created heaven and earth.{*2} 2. And the earth was void and emptiness; and there was darkness on the face{*3} of the abyss. And the Spirit of God was constantly moving on the face of the water.<br />3. And God said, "Let there be light," and there was light.<br />4. And God saw the light, that it was good; and God made a distinction between light and darkness.<br />5. And God called the light day, and the darkness he called night. And there was evening and there was morning, the first day.<br />6. And God said, "Let there be an expanse in the middle of the waters, and let it exist to make a distinction among the waters, in the waters."<br />7. And God made the expanse, and he made a distinction between the waters that were under the expanse and the waters that were over the expanse; and so it was done.<br />8. And God called the expanse heaven. And there was evening and there was morning, the second day.<br />9. And God said, "Let the waters under heaven be gathered into one place, and let dry land appear," and so it was done.<br />10. And God called the dry land earth, and the gathering of waters he called seas. And God saw that it was good.<br />11. And God said, "Let the earth cause the sprouting on the earth of the tender plant, of the plant bearing its seed, of the fruit tree making the fruit that holds its seed, each in the way of its kind," and so it was done.<br />12. And the earth produced the tender plant, the plant bearing its seed in the way of its kind, and the tree making the fruit that held its seed in the way of its kind, and God saw that it was good.<br />13. And there was evening and there was morning, the third day.<br />14. And God said, "Let there be lights in the expanse of the heavens to make a distinction between day and night; and they will act as signals and will be used for seasons for both the days and the years.<br />15. And they will act as lights in the expanse of the heavens to shed light on the earth;" and so it was done.<br />16. And God made the two great lights: the greater light to rule by day and the smaller light to rule by night; and the stars.<br />17. And God placed them in the expanse of the heavens, to shed light on the earth,<br />18. and to rule during the day and during the night, and to make a distinction between light and darkness; and God saw that it was good.<br />19. And there was evening and there was morning, the fourth day.<br />20. And God said, "Let the waters cause the creeping animal — a living soul — to creep out. And let the bird flit over the land, over the face of the expanse of the heavens."<br />21. And God created the big sea creatures, and every living, creeping soul that the waters caused to creep out, in all their kinds, and every bird on the wing, of every kind. And God saw that it was good.<br />22. And God blessed them, saying, "Reproduce and multiply and fill the water in the seas, and the birds will multiply on the land."<br />23. And there was evening and there was morning, the fifth day.<br />24. And God said, "Let the earth produce each living soul according to its kind: the beast, and that which moves, and the wild animal of the earth, each according to its kind;" and so it was done.<br />25. And God made each wild animal of the earth according to its kind, and each beast according to its kind, and every animal creeping on the ground according to its kind; and God saw that it was good.<br />26. And God said, "Let us make a human in our image, after our likeness; and these{*4} will rule over the fish of the sea and over the bird in the heavens, and over the beast, and over all the earth, and over every creeping animal that creeps on the earth."<br />27. And God created the human in his image; in God's image he created them; male and female he created them.<br />28. And God blessed them, and God said to them, "Reproduce and multiply, and fill the earth and harness it, and rule over the fish of the sea and over the bird in the heavens and over every living animal creeping on the earth."<br />29. And God said, "Here, now, I am giving you every seed-bearing plant on the face of all the earth and every tree that has fruit; the tree that produces seed will serve you for food.<br />30. And every wild animal of the earth and every bird in the heavens and every animal creeping on the earth, in which there is a living soul — every green plant will serve them for nourishment." And so it was done.<br />31. And God saw all that he had done and, yes, it was very good. And there was evening and there was morning, the sixth day.<br />6. Summary<br />THE six days or time periods, meaning so many consecutive stages in a person's regeneration, are these, in outline: <br /><br /><strong>Footnotes:</strong><br />{*1} Swedenborg here, writing in late 1748 or early 1749, mentions that his consciousness of the spiritual world began "several years" ago and has continued in an unbroken fashion. (He uses the same phrase, "several years," in similar contexts elsewhere in the present volume, in <a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_6/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_59#subsection-2-2" target=_top>59:2</a>, <a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_6/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_67" target=_top>67</a>, <a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_6/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_70" target=_top>70</a>, <a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_6/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_150" target=_top>150</a>, <a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_6/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_227" target=_top>227</a>, and 322:1, although in the last two of these instances he adds the nuance that his dual consciousness throughout that time has been "almost" continual.) Nevertheless, fixing a particular date to the shift is difficult, because Swedenborg gives somewhat conflicting evidence. In discussing it, he never gives a range of dates; he invariably assigns it either a single date or a fixed number of months or years before the time of writing. Yet the stated or implied date generally recedes the older he gets; that is, in the late 1740s, he places it in 1745; in the 1750s through 1766, he places it in 1744; and after 1766 he places it in 1743. See Tafel's recapitulation (Tafel 1877, 1118-1127). This receding date may have been the effect of simple forgetfulness, or it may have been the result of an evolving understanding of the significance of various turning points and changes in consciousness he experienced between 1743, 1745. [JSR]<br />{*2} (in the text of <a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_6/bible_king-james-version_genesis_1_1" target=_top>Genesis 1:1</a>). Swedenborg's translations of the Hebrew and Greek Scriptures into Latin were deliberately literal, and an attempt has been made in this translation to reflect this literal quality. For his translations in the current work, Swedenborg relied heavily on the Latin version of Scripture produced by Sebastian Schmidt (1617-1696), both in the independent Latin version (1696), and in the bilingual (Hebrew and Latin) van der Hooght-Schmidt version of 1740 (on Swedenborg's use of the latter, see Cole 1977, 33). Though he admired the Schmidt version for its faithfulness, he did also make alterations based on his reading of the Hebrew and Greek. Readers who compare his versions with standard English translations may therefore notice variations from those texts. As a general rule they have not been noted in this edition. For further discussion of the translation of biblical passages in this edition, see the translator's preface, pages 8-11. [LHC, SS]<br />{*3} (in the text of <a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_6/bible_king-james-version_genesis_1_2" target=_top>Genesis 1:2</a>). The Hebrew word for "face" (פָּנִים [pānîm]) is plural, and Swedenborg very often renders it literally, with a Latin plural, as here (faciebus). He speaks explicitly of the importance of grammatical number with respect to several other words (see, for example, <a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_6/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_30#subsection-2-2" target=_top>30:2</a>, <a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_6/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_50#subsection-2-3" target=_top>50:3</a>, <a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_6/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_253" target=_top>253</a>, <a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_6/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_304" target=_top>304</a>, <a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_6/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_374#subsection-2-3" target=_top>374:3</a>), but not this one. It has been rendered in the singular to accord with English usage. [LHC]<br /><a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_6/bible_king-james-version_genesis_1_26" target=_top>Genesis 1:26</a>). On the meaning of the shift here from the singular, "a human," to the plural, "these," see <a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_6/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_478" target=_top>478</a>.
