<h4 align="center"></h4><p><strong>3631.</strong>有一次，还以活生生的方式向我显明构成脸部区域的社群，这些社群流入前额、两颊、下巴和肚子上的肌肉；并显明它们是哪些具体社群及其性质，流入的方式，以及彼此如何关联。为了将这一切生动展现出来，它们被允许藉着流注以各种方式呈现出一张脸的形状。以同样的方式我被指示流入唇、舌、眼、耳的是哪些社群及其性质。我还被允许与他们交谈，从而得到充分指教。由此也清楚向我表明，所有进入天堂的人都构成这个大人的器官或肢体，并且天堂永不关闭；相反，天堂里的人越多，努力就越强大，力就越强大，活动也越强大。此外，主的天堂是浩瀚的，并且如此浩瀚，以至于超出所有想象。与天堂相比，这个星球上的居民少得可怜，几乎如同与大海相比之下的小池塘。</p>

It was also once shown me to the life what societies they are, and of what quality, and how they flow in and act, which constitute the province of the face, and flow into the muscles of the forehead, 
of the cheeks, of the chin, and of the neck, and what communication there is between them. In order that this might be presented to the life, it was allowed them by means of influx and in various ways 
to present the appearance of a face. In like manner it was shown what societies, and of what quality, flow into the lips, into the tongue, into the eyes, and into the ears; and it was also given to 
speak with them, and thus to be fully instructed. In this way it was made evident that all who come into heaven are organs or members of the Grand Man; and also that heaven is never shut, but that the 
greater its numbers the stronger is the endeavor, the stronger the force, and the stronger the action; and further, that the heaven of the Lord is immeasurable, so immeasurable as to exceed all belief; 
the inhabitants of this earth being very few in comparison, and almost as a pool compared with the ocean. </p>

On one occasion also I was shown in a wholly living way the communities which constitute the province of the face and which flow into the muscles of the forehead, the cheeks, the chin, and the neck. 
I was shown which particular communities they were, what those communities were like, the manner in which they flowed in, and how they communicated with one another. To make it a living presentation they 
were allowed by flowing in - in varying ways - to produce the likeness of a face. In a similar way I have been shown which ones they are, and what those communities are like which flow into the lips, 
the tongue, the eyes, and the ears. And I have also been allowed to talk to them, and so become thoroughly informed. From this it has also become clear to me that all who enter heaven constitute the 
organs or limbs of the Grand Man, and also that heaven is never shut, but that the more people there are in heaven the stronger is the endeavour, the stronger the force, and the stronger the activity. 
In addition it has become clear that the Lord's heaven is vast, so vast as to surpass all belief. Compared with heaven the inhabitants on this planet are very few, little more than a pond in comparison 
with the ocean. </p>

</p><b>3631.</b>
Semel etiam prorsus ad vivum ostensum est quaenam et quales societates sunt, et quomodo influunt et agunt illae quae constituunt provinciam faciei, et in ejus frontis, genarum, menti et cervicis musculos 
influunt, et quomodo illae inter se communicant; utque sisteretur hoc ad vivum, effigiare illis licebat faciem variis modis per influxum; similiter quae et quales societates {1}influunt in labia, 
in linguam, in oculos, in aures; et datum quoque loqui cum illis, et sic plene instrui. Inde quoque constare potuit quod omnes qui in caelum veniunt, sint organa seu membra Maximi Hominis; et quoque 
quod caelum nusquam claudatur, sed quo (x)plures, eo fortior conatus, fortior vis, et fortior actio: tum quod caelum Domini sit immensum, et tam immensum ut omnem fidem superet; incolae hujus telluris 
sunt paucissimi respective, et paene sicut lacus respective ad oceanum. @1 i quae$ </p>
