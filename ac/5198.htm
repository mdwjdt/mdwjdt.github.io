<h3 align="center" class="ired">属天的奥秘 第5198节</h3>
<h4 align="center"></h4><p><strong>5198.</strong>“有七只母牛上来”表属世层的真理。这从“母牛”的含义清楚可知，“母牛”是指属世层的真理，如下文所述。之所以有“七只”，是因为“七”表示神圣之物（参看<a href="395.htm">395</a>，<a href="433.htm">433</a>，<a href="716.htm">716</a>节），因此，加上这个数字有助于让人想到主题的神圣性（参看<a href="881.htm">881</a>节）。此外，这里所论述的主题是神圣，因为它涉及属世层通过与属灵层的属天层结合而进一步再生。“母牛”或“小母牛”表示属世层的真理，这一点从以下事实可以看出来：“公牛”或“小公牛”表示属世层的良善（<a href="2180.htm">2180</a>，<a href="2566.htm">2566</a>，<a href="2781.htm">2781</a>，<a href="2830.htm">2830</a>节）。因为在圣言中，凡雄性表示良善的地方，雌性就表示真理；另一方面，凡雄性表示真理的地方，雌性就表示良善。正因如此，“母牛”表示属世层的真理，因为“公牛”表示属世层的良善。<br />凡圣言中提及的所有动物，无一例外地表示情感，邪恶而无用的动物表示邪恶的情感，温顺而有用的动物表示良善的情感（参看<a href="45.htm">45</a>，<a href="46.htm">46</a>，<a href="142.htm">142</a>，<a href="143.htm">143</a>，<a href="246.htm">246</a>，<a href="714.htm">714</a>，<a href="715.htm">715</a>，<a href="719.htm">719</a>，<a href="776.htm">776</a>，<a href="1823.htm">1823</a>，<a href="2179.htm">2179</a>，<a href="2180.htm">2180</a>，<a href="3218.htm">3218</a>，<a href="3519.htm">3519</a>节）。它们具有这种含义的原因在于出现在灵人界的代表，因为每当天堂里的人谈论情感时，灵人界就会出现对应于这类情感的动物。我经常蒙允许看到这一切幕，有时对这种现象的起源感到困惑；不过，我也被引导发觉，动物的生命无非是情感，因为它们出于缺乏理性的本能而遵循自己与生俱来的情感，在这些情感的引导下实现自己的特定功用。除了地上所见到的动物表现出的那种肉体形式外，再没有其它肉体形式适合这些缺乏理性的情感了。正因如此，当天上只讨论情感时，这些情感在灵人界所取的最终形式表面上看，与这类动物的肉体形式是一样的；因为这些情感无法披上任何其它形式，只能披上诸如与它们相对应的那类形式。我也见过奇怪的动物，它们在自然界的任何地方都没有出现过。它们是未知情感和混杂情感所取的形式。<br />这就是在圣言中“动物”表示情感的原因；至于表示哪种观念，这只能从内义看出来。“公牛”表示属世层的良善，这可见于前面所引用的经文；“母牛”表示属世层的真理，这从提及它们的经文（如以赛亚书<a href="http://39-27.cn/赛11.7.htm">11:7</a>；何西阿书<a href="http://39-27.cn/何4.16.htm">4:16</a>；阿摩司书<a href="http://39-27.cn/摩4.1.htm">4:1</a>），以及用来洁净以色列人的除污秽的水可以看出来，因为除污秽的水要在营外从烧成灰的红母牛那里提供，再掺上香柏木、牛膝草和朱红色线（民数记<a href="http://39-27.cn/民19.2.htm">19:2</a>-<a href="http://39-27.cn/民19.11.htm">11</a>）。当这个过程的含义藉着内义被揭开时，可以看出“红母牛”表示属世层里面的不洁真理，它通过“烧”并藉着诸如“香柏木”、“牛膝草”和“朱红色线”所表示的那类事物变得洁净。通过这个过程所提供的“水”代表洁净的方法。</p>

There came up seven kine. That this signifies were truths of the natural, is evident from the signification of "kine," as being truths of the natural (of which presently). That there were seven, is because 
"seven" signifies what is holy (see n. 395, 433, 716), and hence this number adds holiness to the subject (see n. 881). Moreover, the subject here treated of is holy, for it is the further rebirth 
of the natural by its conjunction with the celestial of the spiritual. That "kine" or "heifers" signify truths of the natural may be seen from the fact that "oxen" and "bullocks" signify goods of 
the natural (n. 2180, 2566, 2781, 2830); for wherever in the Word the male signifies good, the female signifies truth; and on the other hand where the male signifies truth, the female signifies good. 
Hence it is that a "cow" signifies the truth of the natural, for an "ox" signifies its good. [2] (That all beasts whatever mentioned in the Word signify affections-evil and useless beasts evil affections, 
but gentle and useful ones good affections-may be seen above, n. 45, 46, 142, 143, 246, 714, 715, 719, 776, 1823, 2179, 2180, 3218, 3519.) The cause of this signification is from representatives 
in the world of spirits; for when those in heaven are speaking about affections, in the world of spirits are represented beasts corresponding to that kind of affections. This has often been given me 
to see, and I have sometimes wondered why it was; but I perceived that the lives of beasts are nothing but affections, for they follow their affection from instinct without reason, and so are carried 
along each to its own use. To these affections without reason no other bodily forms are suitable than such as those in which beasts appear upon the earth. Hence it is that when there is discourse about 
affections only, ultimate forms of these affections appear that are similar to the bodily forms of such beasts; for these affections cannot be clothed with any other forms than those which correspond 
to them. I have also seen strange beasts which exist nowhere in the world, and which were the forms of unknown and of mixed affections.  [3] This then is the reason why in the Word by "beasts" are 
signified affections; but what affections are signified appears only from the internal sense. That by "oxen" is signified the good of the natural may be seen in the passages cited above, and that by "kine" 
are signified truths of the natural may be seen from the passages in which they are mentioned (as in Isaiah 11:7; Hosea 4:16; Amos 4:1); and also from the water of separation wherewith the sons 
of Israel were to be made clean, which was prepared from a red cow burned to ashes outside the camp, and with which cedar wood, hyssop, and double-dyed scarlet were mingled (Num. 19:2-11). When the meaning 
of this proceeding is disclosed by means of the internal sense, it is seen that by a "red cow" is signified truth of the natural that was unclean, and was made clean by the burning and also by means 
of such things as are signified by "cedar wood," "hyssop," and "double-dyed scarlet;" the "water" therefrom representing the means of purification. </p>

'Seven cows were coming up' means the truths belonging to the natural. This is clear from the meaning of 'cows' as the truths belonging to the natural, dealt with below. The reason there were seven is 
that 'seven' means that which is holy, <a href="395.htm">395</a>, <a href="433.htm">433</a>, <a href="716.htm">716</a>, and therefore this number contributes to any matter under consideration the idea of holiness, dealt with in <a href="881.htm">881</a>. The matter under consideration 
here is likewise of a holy nature since it concerns a further rebirth of the natural through the joining of this to the celestial of the spiritual. As regards 'cows' or 'young cows' meaning the truths 
belonging to the natural, this becomes clear from the fact that 'bulls' and 'young bulls' mean forms of good belonging to the natural, <a href="2180.htm">2180</a>, <a href="2566.htm">2566</a>, <a href="2781.htm">2781</a>, <a href="2830.htm">2830</a>. For in the Word, when a male means good, 
its female means truth, and conversely when the male means truth its female means good, so that 'a cow' means some truth belonging to the natural, because 'a bull' means some form of good belonging to 
it.  </p>

<p><b>[2]</b>
 All beasts without exception that are mentioned in the Word mean affections, evil and useless beasts meaning evil affections, gentle and useful ones meaning good affections, see <a href="45.htm">45</a>, <a href="46.htm">46</a>, <a href="142.htm">142</a>, <a href="143.htm">143</a>, <a href="246.htm">246</a>, <a href="714.htm">714</a>, <a href="715.htm">715</a>, <a href="719.htm">719</a>, <a href="776.htm">776</a>, <a href="1823.htm">1823</a>, <a href="2179.htm">2179</a>, <a href="2180.htm">2180</a>, <a href="3218.htm">3218</a>, <a href="3519.htm">3519</a>. The reason why they have such a meaning lies in the representations that occur in the world of spirits, for whenever a discussion about 
affections is taking place in heaven, beasts corresponding to affections of the kind under discussion are represented in the world of spirits, as I have also been allowed quite often to see. On several 
occasions I have wondered about the origin of that phenomenon, but have been led to perceive that the lives led by beasts are nothing else than affections; for they respond instinctively, devoid of 
reason, to their innate affections and are led by these to fulfill their specific functions. No other physical forms are suited to these affections devoid of reason than the kinds in which they are seen 
on earth. This explains why, when the discussion in heaven is about affections alone, the ultimate forms that those affections take in the world of spirits are the same in appearance as the physical 
forms of such beasts; for those affections cannot be clothed with any other forms than ones such as correspond to them. I have also seen beasts, the like of which do not appear anywhere at all in the 
natural world. They were the forms taken by affections that are not known and by affections that are mingled together. </p>

<p><b>[3]</b>
 Here then is the reason why in the Word affections are meant by 'beasts', 
though which particular affections are meant cannot be seen from anywhere else than the internal sense. 'Bulls' means the good belonging to the natural, as may be seen in the paragraphs listed above; 
and as for the meaning of 'cows' as the truths belonging to the natural, this becomes clear from other places where they are referred to, such as <a href="http://bible.gospelcom.net/cgi-bin/bible?passage=Isaiah%2011:7&amp;version=ESV&amp;interface=print&amp;showfn=yes&amp;showxref">Isaiah 11:7</a>; <a href="http://bible.gospelcom.net/cgi-bin/bible?passage=Hosea%204:16&amp;version=ESV&amp;interface=print&amp;showfn=yes&amp;showxref">Hosea 4:16</a>; <a href="http://bible.gospelcom.net/cgi-bin/bible?passage=Amos%204:1&amp;version=ESV&amp;interface=print&amp;showfn=yes&amp;showxref">Amos 4:1</a>, as well as from 
the reference in <a href="http://bible.gospelcom.net/cgi-bin/bible?passage=Num%2019:2-10&amp;version=ESV&amp;interface=print&amp;showfn=yes&amp;showxref">Num 19:2-10</a> to the water of separation by which they were to be made clean and which was prepared from the red cow burned to ashes outside the camp, with which cedar wood was mixed, 
hyssop, and twice-dyed scarlet. When the meaning of this procedure is disclosed with the help of the internal sense, it shows that 'the red cow', meaning unclean truth within the natural, is made clean 
by 'burning', and also by the kinds of things meant by 'cedar wood, hyssop, and twice-dyed scarlet'. The water prepared by that process represented the means of purification. </p>

`Ascendentes septem vaccae': quod significet vera naturalis, constat a significatione `vaccarum' quod sint vera naturalis, de qua sequitur; quod septem fuerint, est quia `septem' significant sanctum, 
n. 395, 433, 716, et {1}inde numerus ille adjicit sanctitatem rei, de qua agitur n. 881; res etiam de qua hic agitur, est sancta, agitur enim de ulteriore renascentia naturalis per conjunctionem ejus 
cum caelesti   spiritualis. Quod `vaccae' seu juvencae significent vera naturalis, constare potest ex eo quod `boves et juvenci' significent bona naturalis, n. 2180, 2566, 2781, 2830; in Verbo enim 
ubi masculus significat bonum, ibi femina verum, (c)ac vice versa ubi masculus significat verum, ibi femina bonum; inde est quod `vacca' significet verum naturalis, quia `bos' significat bonum ejus; [2] 
quod omnes bestiae quaecumque in Verbo nominantur, significent affectiones, bestiae malae et inutiles affectiones malas, at bestiae mites et utiles affectiones bonas,   videatur n. 45, 46, 142, 143, 
246, 714, 715, 719, 776, 1823, 2179, 2180, 3218, 3519; causa quod significent, est ex repraesentativis in mundo spirituum, cum enim sermo est in caelo de affectionibus, tunc repraesentantur in mundo 
spirituum bestiae quae correspondent illius generis affectionibus de quibus sermo est, quod etiam saepius mihi videre datum est; et aliquoties miratus sum unde id, at perceptum quod bestiarum vitae non 
aliud sint quam affectiones, sequuntur enim affectionem suam ex instinctu absque ratione et sic feruntur quaelibet ad suum usum; affectionibus illis absque ratione non aliae formae corporum competunt 
quam quales sunt in quibus apparent super terra; inde est, cum de solis affectionibus est sermo, quod formae earum ultimae similes formis corporum talium bestiarum appareant, nam aliis indui nequeunt 
affectiones illae quam quae correspondent; visae quoque mihi sunt bestiae peregrinae quae in mundo nullibi existunt; fuerunt ex affectionibus ignotis et ex affectionibus mixtis; [3] inde nunc est quod 
in Verbo per `bestias' significentur affectiones, sed quaenam affectiones non aliunde patet quam ex sensu interno; quod per `boves' significetur bonum naturalis, videatur in locis supra citatis, et 
quod per `vaccas' vera naturalis, constare potest ab illis locis ubi nominantur, {2}ut apud Esaiam xi 7, Hos. iv 16, Amos iv 1; tum quoque Ex aqua separationis qua mundarentur, quae parata fuit ex 
    vacca rufa combusta in cinerem extra castra, cui admiscebatur lignum cedri, hyssopus et dibaphum coccineum, Num. xix (x)2-10;  is processus cum recluditur per sensum internum, indicat quod per `vaccam 
rufam' significetur verum naturalis immundum quod mundum factum per combustionem, tum quoque per talia quae significantur per `lignum cedri, hyssopum et dibaphum coccineum'; aqua inde repraesentabat 
medium purificationis. @1 praeterea$ @2 sicut$ </p>
