<h3 align="center" class="ired">属天的奥秘 第3929节</h3>
<h4 align="center"></h4><p><strong>3929.</strong>创世记30:9-11.利亚见自己停了生育，就把使女悉帕给雅各为妾。利亚的使女悉帕给雅各生了一个儿子。利亚说，万军来了！于是给他起名叫迦得。<br />“利亚见自己停了生育”表其它外在真理没有得到承认。“就把使女悉帕”表一种肯定方法，外在人与内在人能通过这种方法结合。“给雅各为妾”表这种方法将二者结合起来。“利亚的使女悉帕给雅各生了一个儿子”表承认。“利亚说，万军来了”在至高意义上表全能和全知，在内在意义上表信之良善，在外在意义上表行为。“于是给他起名叫迦得”表它的根本性质。</p>

Verses 9-11. And Leah saw that she had stood still from bearing, and she took Zilpah her handmaid, and gave her to Jacob for a woman. And Zilpah Leah's handmaid bare Jacob a son. And Leah said, A troop 
cometh, and she called his name Gad. "And Leah saw that she had stood still from bearing," signifies that no other external truths had been acknowledged; "and she took Zilpah her handmaid," signifies 
an affirmative conjoining means; "and gave her to Jacob for a woman," signifies that this effected conjunction; "and Zilpah Leah's handmaid bare Jacob a son," signifies acknowledgment; "and Leah said, 
A troop cometh," signifies in the supreme sense omnipotence and omniscience, in the internal sense the good of faith, and in the external sense works; "and she called his name Gad," signifies its quality. </p>

Verses 9-11 And Leah saw that she had stopped bearing, and she took Zilpah her servant-girl, and gave her to Jacob as his wife. And Zilpah, Leah's servant-girl, bore Jacob a son. And Leah said, A troop 
comes! And she called his name Gad. </p>
<p>'Leah saw that she had stopped bearing' means that no other external truths had been acknowledged. 'And she took Zilpah her servant-girl' means an affirmative 
means through which [the external man and the internal] could be joined together. 'And gave her to Jacob as his wife' means that this means joined the two together. 'And Zilpah, Leah's servant-girl, 
bore Jacob a son' means acknowledgement. 'And Leah said, A troop comes!' in the highest sense means Omnipotence and Omniscience, in the internal sense the good of faith, and in the external sense works. 
'And she called his name Gad' means the essential nature of it. </p>

Vers. 9-11.  Et vidit Leah quod substitisset a pariendo, et accepit Zilpam ancillam suam, et dedit illam Jacobo ad mulierem.  Et peperit Zilpah ancilla Leae Jacobo filium.  Et dixit Leah, Venit turma; 
et vocavit nomen ejus Gad. `Vidit Leah quod substitisset a pariendo' significat quod non alia vera externa agnita fuerint: `et accepit Zilpam ancillam suam' significat medium affirmativum conjungens: 
`et dedit illam Jacobo ad mulierem' significat quod illud conjungeret: `et peperit Zilpah ancilla Leae Jacobo filium' significat agnitionem: `et dixit Leah, Venit turma' significat in supremo 
sensu Omnipotentiam et Omniscientiam, in interno bonum fidei, in externo opera: `et vocavit nomen ejus Gad' significat quale ejus. </p>
