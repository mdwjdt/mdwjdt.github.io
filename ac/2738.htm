<h3 align="center" class="ired">属天的奥秘 第2738节</h3>
<h4 align="center"></h4><p><strong>2738.</strong>诸如存在于天堂的相爱与婚姻之爱不是一回事。婚姻之爱在于渴望与对方的生命合而为一，而相爱在于渴望别人比自己更好，如同父母对孩子的爱，以及那些喜欢行善，但不是为了自己，而是因为在行善中找到快乐之人的爱。这类天使般的爱就源于婚姻之爱，并且就是从这爱而生的，如同孩子从父母而生。因此，父母对自己的孩子就具有这种天使般的爱。即使父母没有婚姻之爱，主也会将这爱保存在父母身上，以防止人类灭亡。</p>

<p align="center"><b>Potts(1905-1910) 2738</b></p><p><b>2738.</b>
Mutual love, such as there is in heaven, is not like conjugial love. Conjugial love consists in desiring to be in the other's life as a one; but mutual love consists in wishing better to another than 
to one's self, as is the case with the love of parents toward their children, and as is the love of those who are in the love of doing good, not for their own sake, but because this is a joy to them. 
Such angelic love is derived from conjugial love, and is born from it as a child from its parent; and for this reason it exists with parents toward their children. This love is preserved by the Lord 
with parents, even if they are not in conjugial love, in order that the human race may not perish. </p>

<p align="center"><b>Elliott(1983-1999) 2738</b></p><p><b>2738.</b>
Mutual love such as is present in heaven is not the same as conjugial love. Conjugial love there consists in the desire to be one in the life of the other, but mutual love consists in desiring what is 
good to another rather than to oneself, as with the love of parents towards children, and as with the love of those who are moved to do good not for their own benefit but because they find joy in doing 
it. Such angelic love is derived from conjugial love, and is born from it like a child from its parent. For this reason that love exists in parents towards their children. This love is preserved by 
the Lord in parents even when conjugial love is not present in them, to prevent the human race from perishing. </p>

<p align="center"><b>Latin(1748-1756) 2738</b>
</p><b>2738.</b>
Amor mutuus qualis est in caelo, non est sicut amor conjugialis; hic est quod velit esse in alterius vita ut unum, sed ille ut alteri melius velit quam sibi, qualis est parentum erga liberos, et qualis 
est illorum qui afficiuntur benefaciendo non propter se, sed propter quod hoc illis gaudio. Talis amor angelicus derivatur ab amore conjugiali, ac inde nascitur sicut infans a suo parente, quare etiam 
apud parentes erga liberos ille est; hic amor conservatur a Domino apud parentes, tametsi non in amore conjugiali sunt, ex causa ne genus humanum pereat. </p>
