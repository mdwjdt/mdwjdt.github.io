<h3 align="center" class="ired">属天的奥秘 第4248节</h3>
<h4 align="center"></h4><p><strong>4248.</strong>“并且还有四百人同他一齐来”表现在它的状态，即它要占据第一位。这从“四百”的含义清楚可知，严格来说，“四百”是指试探及其持续时间（参看<a href="2959.htm">2959</a>，<a href="2966.htm">2966</a>节）。这就是所指的状态，这一点从下面的细节明显看出来，即：“雅各就甚惧怕，而且愁烦”，因此将他的营分成两个（32:7-8）；又出于惧怕而祈求耶和华（32:9-12）；最终与一位天使摔跤，这摔跤就表示试探，这从本章后面关于这次摔跤的解释清楚看出来。当正经历重生之人的状态被颠倒时，也就是说，当良善占据第一位时，试探就会到来。在此之前，这人无法承受它们，因为他尚未拥有他用来防卫自己并寻求慰藉的认知。也因此缘故，在成年之前，没有人会经受试探。试探就是那将真理与良善结合起来的经历（参看<a href="2272.htm">2272</a>，<a href="3318.htm">3318</a>，<a href="3696.htm">3696</a>，<a href="3928.htm">3928</a>节）。由此明显可知，“同他一齐来的四百人”表示当良善要占据第一位时的状态。</p>

And four hundred men with him. That this signifies its state now, that it may take the prior place, is evident from the signification of "four hundred," as properly being temptations and their duration 
(see n. 2959, 2966). This is the state which is meant, as may be seen from what follows, namely, that "he feared exceedingly, and was distressed," and therefore "halved his camp into two" (verses 7-8); 
and also that out of fear he made ardent supplication to Jehovah (verses 9-12); and finally wrestled with an angel, by which wrestling is signified temptation, as will be evident from the explication 
of this wrestling in what follows in this chapter. When the state with the man who is being regenerated is being inverted, that is, when good takes the first place, then come temptations. Before 
this time the man cannot undergo them, because he is not yet in the knowledges wherewith to defend himself, and to which he may have recourse for comfort. For this reason also no one undergoes temptations 
until he has arrived at adult age. Temptations are what unite truths to good (see n. 2272, 3318, 3696, 3928). From this it is manifest that by the "four hundred men with him" is signified the state, 
that good may take the prior place. </p>

'And four hundred men with him' means its state now, set to take up the first position. This is clear from the meaning of 'four hundred' strictly speaking as temptations and the time these lasted, dealt 
with in <a href="2959.htm">2959</a>, <a href="2966.htm">2966</a>. This is the state that is meant, as becomes clear from the details that follow, namely that he was exceedingly afraid and was distressed and therefore divided his camp into two, 
verses 7, 8, and also that out of fear he prayed intensely to Jehovah, verses 9-12, and finally wrestled with an angel, by which wrestling is meant temptation, as will be clear from the explanation 
of that wrestling later on in this chapter. When the state of one who is being regenerated is turned around, that is, when good takes up the first position, temptations arrive. He is unable to undergo 
them prior to that because he does not as yet possess the cognitions with which he may defend himself and to which he may resort to receive comfort. For this reason also no one undergoes temptations 
until he reaches adult life, temptations being experiences which unite truths to good, <a href="2272.htm">2272</a>, <a href="3318.htm">3318</a>, <a href="3696.htm">3696</a>, <a href="3928.htm">3928</a>. From this it is evident that 'four hundred men with him' means a state when good is set to 
take up the first position. </p>

`Et quadringenti viri cum eo': quod significet statum ejus nunc ut priorem locum sumat, constat a significatione `quadringentorum' quod sint proprie tentationes et earum duratio, de qua n. 2959, 
2966; hic status est qui intelligitur; quod ille status sit, constare potest ab illis quae sequuntur, quod nempe `timuerit valde, et angustia fuerit ei,' quodque ideo `castra sua in duo diviserit,' 
vers. 7, 8; tum quod ex timore ardenter supplicaverit ad Jehovam, vers. 9-12; et denique quod luctatus sit cum angelo, per quam luctationem quod tentatio significetur, constabit ab explicatione luctationis 
illius in sequentibus hujus capitis.  Cum invertitur status apud hominem qui regeneratur, hoc est, cum bonum priorem locum sumit, tunc tentationes veniunt; prius homo illas non {1} subire 
potest, quia nondum est in cognitionibus per quas se defendat, et {2} ad quas recurrat ad solatium capiendum; quapropter etiam nullus tentationes subit priusquam ad adultam aetatem pervenit; tentationes 
sunt quae uniunt vera bono, n. 2272, 3318, 3696, 3928.  Inde patet quod per `quadringentos viros cum eo' significetur status ut bonum priorem locum sumat.      @1 non illas$      @2 seu$ </p>
