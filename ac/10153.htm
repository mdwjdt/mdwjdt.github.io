<h3 align="center" class="ired">属天的奥秘 第10153节</h3>
<h4 align="center"></h4><p><strong>10153</strong>.“我要住在以色列人中间”表在天堂和教会中，主的同在，以及祂经由良善而来的流注。这从“住”的含义和“以色列人”的代表清楚可知。“住”当论及主时，是指同在和流入；之所以是指祂通过神性良善而如此行，是因为“住”论及良善（参看<a href="2268.htm">2268</a>，<a href="2451.htm">2451</a>，<a href="2712.htm">2712</a>，<a href="3613.htm">3613</a>，<a href="8269.htm">8269</a>，<a href="8309.htm">8309</a>节），这就是为何经上还说“中间”，因为“中间”表示至内在之物，至内在之物就是良善（关于“中间”的这层含义，可参看<a href="2940.htm">2940</a>，<a href="5897.htm">5897</a>，<a href="6084.htm">6084</a>，<a href="6103.htm">6103</a>节）。“以色列人”是指教会（参看<a href="9340.htm">9340</a>节）。<br />“住在中间”当论及主时，之所以表示祂的同在和经由神性良善而来的流注，是因为主在人从祂所获得的良善中流入此人并与他同在。良善构成这个人自己，或说此人真正的自我，因为每个人的品性都取决于他的良善。良善要理解为爱，因为凡被爱之物都被称为良善。凡观察别人的人都知道，爱或良善构成这个人；因为当观察别人时，他通过别人的爱而把这个人引向凡他所愿意的任何地方，以至于这个别人在受他的爱支配时，就不再是自己的主人，凡与他的爱不一致的理由对他来说什么都不是，而与他的爱一致的理由则是一切。<br />事实就是这样，这一点在来世也是显而易见的。在来世，所有灵人都能凭他们的爱被认出来，当受这些爱支配时，他们无法做出违背它们的任何事，因为违背它们行事，就是违背他们自己行事。因此，他们是自己的爱的化身或形式，天堂里的人是天堂之爱和仁的化身或形式，美丽得无法形容；而地狱里的人则是他们自己的爱的化身或形式，这些爱是对自我和世界的爱，所以他们也是仇恨和报复的化身或形式，因而是怪物，可怕到无法形容。<br />因此，由于一个人的爱如何，整个人就如何，所以显而易见，主不可能与一个陷入恶爱的人同在，只能与一个处于善爱的人同在，因而在他的良善里面。人们以为主存在于被称为信之真理的真理中；但祂并不存在于没有良善的真理里面。相反，在良善存在的地方，主通过这良善而存在于真理里面；并且祂在真理通向良善的程度和它从良善发出的程度内而存在于真理里面。没有良善的真理不能说在一个人里面，它只是在他的记忆中，作为记忆知识住在那里，而这记忆知识在成为此人生活的一部分之前，不会进入这个人，并形成他的一部分。当这个人热爱记忆知识，并出于热爱而照之生活时，它就变成他生命的一部分。当这种情况发生时，主就与他同住，如祂自己在约翰福音中所教导的那样：<br />有了我的诫命又遵守的，那人是爱我的，我也要爱他，并且要向他显现自己，我父也必爱他，并且我们要到他那里去，在他那里作我们的住所。（约翰福音<a href="http://39-27.cn/约14.21.htm">14:21</a>，<a href="http://39-27.cn/约14.23.htm">23</a>）<br />“显现自己”表示用来自圣言的信之真理进行光照；“到他那里去”表示同在，“在他那里作住所”表示住在他的良善里面。</p>

And I will dwell in the midst of the sons of Israel. That this signifies the presence of the Lord, and His influx, through good in heaven and in the church, is evident from the signification of "dwelling," 
when said of the Lord, as being to be present and to flow in; that this is through the Divine good is because "to dwell" is predicated of good (see n. 2268, 2451, 2712, 3613, 8269, 8309), wherefore 
also it is said, "in the midst," because by "the midst" is signified the inmost, and the inmost is good (that this is signified by "the midst," see n. 2940, 5897, 6084, 6103). And from the representation 
of the sons of Israel, as being the church (see n. 9340). [2] That by "dwelling in the midst," when said of the Lord, is signified His presence and influx through Divine good, is because the 
Lord flows in and is present with a man in the man's good which he receives from the Lord; for good makes the man himself, because everyone is such as is his good. By good is meant love, for everything 
that is loved is called good. Everyone who spies out another knows that the love or good makes the man, for when he has spied him out he leads him by his love wherever he wishes, in so much that while 
he is kept in his love, he is no longer his own master, and then all reasons that are contrary to his love are of no avail, whereas those which agree with the love are of all avail.  [3] That this 
is the case is also very evident in the other life. There all spirits are known by their loves, and when they are kept in them, they cannot do anything contrary to them, for to act contrary to them 
is to act contrary to themselves. They are therefore the forms of their loves; they who are in the heavens are forms of charity and of heavenly love, of such beauty as cannot be described; but they who 
are in the hells are forms of their loves, which are those of self and of the world, consequently they are also forms of hatred and revenge, thus are such monsters as cannot be described. [4] As therefore 
the whole man is such as is his love, it is evident that the Lord cannot be present with a man who is in an evil love, but only with a man who is in a good love, thus in his good. It is believed 
that the Lord is present in the truth which is called the truth of faith, but He is not present in truth without good. But where good is, there the Lord is present in the truth through the good, and 
He is present in the truth insofar as it leads to good, and as it proceeds from good. Truth without good cannot be said to be within a man, it being merely in his memory as so much memory-knowledge, 
which does not enter the man and form him until it becomes of the life; and it becomes of the life when he loves it, and from love lives according to it. When this is the case, then the Lord dwells with 
him, as He Himself also teaches in John: </p>
<p>     He that hath My commandments, and doeth them, he it is that loveth Me, and I will love him, and will manifest Myself to him, and My Father will love 
him, and We will come unto him, and make Our abode with him (John 14:21, 23); </p>
<p>"to manifest Himself" denotes to enlighten in the truths of faith from the Word; "to come unto him" denotes to be present; 
and "to make abode with him" denotes to dwell in his good. </p>

'And I will dwell in the midst of the children of Israel' means the Lord's presence and His influx through good in heaven and in the Church. This is clear from the meaning of 'dwelling', when this is 
said of the Lord, as His being present and flowing in, His doing so through Divine Good being meant because 'dwelling' has reference to good, see <a href="2268.htm">2268</a>, <a href="2451.htm">2451</a>, <a href="2712.htm">2712</a>, <a href="3613.htm">3613</a>, <a href="8269.htm">8269</a>, <a href="8309.htm">8309</a>, which is why the 
words 'in the midst' are used, because 'the midst' means what is inmost, and that which is inmost is good (for this meaning of 'the midst', see <a href="2940.htm">2940</a>, <a href="2973.htm">2973</a>, <a href="5897.htm">5897</a>, <a href="6084.htm">6084</a>, <a href="6103.htm">6103</a>); and from the representation 
of 'the children of Israel' as the Church, dealt with in <a href="9340.htm">9340</a>.  </p>
<p></p>
<p><b>[2]</b>
 The reason why 'dwelling in the midst', when said of the Lord, means His presence and influx through Divine Good is that the Lord 
flows into and is present with a person in the good he receives from the Lord. Good composes the person's true self, for everyone's character is conditioned by his good. By good, love should be understood, 
since anything that is loved is called good. The fact that a person's love or good makes him what he is may be recognized by anyone at all who observes what another is like; for having observed 
him he can direct him by means of his love wherever he wishes him to go, so much so that when that other person is held under the sway of his own love he is no longer his own master, and reasons which 
disagree with his love count for nothing with him, while those which collude with his love count for everything.  </p>
<p></p>
<p><b>[3]</b>
 The truth of this is also plainly evident in the next life. All spirits there 
are recognized by their loves, and when they are held under the sway of those loves they cannot act in any way contrary to them; for if they act contrary to those loves they act contrary to themselves. 
They are therefore embodiments of their loves, those in the heavens being embodiments of heavenly love and charity, so beautiful that they are beyond description, whereas those in the hells are 
embodiments of their own loves, namely self-love and love of the world, and are consequently embodiments also of hatred and vengeance, thus are monsters so awful that they defy description.  </p>
<p></p>
<p><b>[4]</b>
 Since 
therefore a person's love makes him altogether what he is, it is evident that the Lord cannot be present in a person's love if it is evil, only in a person's love that is good, thus in his good. People 
think that the Lord is present in truth called the truth of faith; but He is not present in truth devoid of good. Where good exists however He is present in truth through that good; and He is present 
in truth to the extent that it leads to good and to the extent that it emanates from good. Truth devoid of good cannot be said to be within a person; it is merely in his memory, residing there as 
factual knowledge which does not enter the person and form part of him until it becomes part of his life. It becomes part of his life when he loves it, and in love lives in accord with it. When this 
happens the Lord dwells with him, as also the Lord teaches in John,  </p>
<blockquote>
He who has My commandments and does them, he it is who loves Me, and I will love him and will manifest Myself to him. And My Father 
will love him, and We will come to him and make Our home with him. <a href="http://bible.gospelcom.net/cgi-bin/bible?passage=John%2014:21,23&amp;version=ESV&amp;interface=print&amp;showfn=yes&amp;showxref">John 14:21,23</a>.  
</blockquote>
<p>'Manifesting Himself' means enlightening with the truths of faith from the Word; 'coming to him' means being 
present; and 'making Their home with him' means dwelling in his good.  </p>

`Et habitabo in medio filiorum Israelis': quod significet praesentiam Domini et influxum Ipsius per bonum in caelo et in Ecclesia, constat ex significatione `habitare' cum de Domino, quod sit praesens 
esse et influere; quod sit per Divinum Bonum, est quia `habitare' praedicatur de bono, videatur n. 2268, 2451, 2712, 3613, 8269, 8309; ideo quoque `in medio' dicitur quia per `medium' significatur 
intimum, `et intimum est bonum; quod id per `medium' significetur, videatur n. 2940, 2973, 5897, 6084, 6103; et ex repraesentatione `filiorum Israelis' quod sint Ecclesia, de qua n. 9340. 	[2] Quod per 
`habitare in medio' cum de Domino, significetur praesentia Ipsius et influxus per Divinum Bonum, est quia Dominus influit et praesens est apud hominem in ejus bono quod recipit a Domino; bonum enim 
facit ipsum hominem; nam quisque talis est, quale ejus bonum; per bonum intelligitur amor, nam omne quod amatur vocatur bonum; quod amor seu bonum ejus faciat hominem, scit unusquisque qui alterum explorat, 
nam cum (d)illum exploraverat, ducit illum per ejus amorem quocumque vult, usque adeo ut cum in amore suo tenetur, non amplius sui juris sit, et tunc rationes quae contra amorem sunt, ad nihil 
valent, at quae cum amore sunt, ad omnia valent. 	[3] Quod ita sit, (o)etiam patet manifeste in altera vita; ibi spiritus omnes noscuntur ex suis amoribus, et cum in illis tenentur, non possunt quicquam 
facere contra illos, nam facere contra illos est facere contra semet; sunt ideo {1} formae suorum amorum; qui in caelis sunt, sunt formae charitatis et amoris caelestis, tanta pulchritudine ut describi 
nequeant; qui autem in infernis sunt, sunt formae (o)suorum amorum, qui sunt sui et mundi, consequenter etiam formae odii et vindictae, ita {2} talia monstra ut nec describi possint. 	[4] Cum 
itaque totus homo est qualis ejus amor, patet quod Dominus non possit praesens esse in amore malo sed in amore bono apud hominem, ita in bono ejus; creditur quod Dominus in vero quod vocatur fidei praesens 
sit, sed non praesens est in vero absque bono, at {3} (x)ubi bonum est, ibi praesens est in vero per bonum, (c)et tantum in vero quantum ducit ad bonum, et quantum procedit a bono; verum absque 
bono non dici potest esse intus in homine, est solum {4} in memoria ejus ut scientificum quod non intrat hominem et facit illum priusquam fit vitae; et tunc fit vitae cum amat illud, et ex amore vivit 
secundum illud; cum hoc fit, tunc Dominus habitat apud illum; hoc {5} etiam Dominus docet apud Johannem,      	Qui habet praecepta Mea et facit illa, ille est qui amat Me, et Ego amabo illum, et manifestabo 
illi Me Ipsum; et Pater Meus amabit illum, et ad illum veniemus, et mansionem apud illum faciemus, xiv 21, 23; </p>
<p>`manifestare Se Ipsum' est illustrare in veris fidei ex Verbo, `venire ad illum' 
est praesens esse, et `mansionem facere apud illum' est habitare in ejus bono. @1 etiam$ @2 et passim$ @3 et$ @4 enim$ @5 quod$ </p>
