<h3 align="center" class="ired">属天的奥秘 第9275节</h3>
<h4 align="center"></h4><p><strong>9275.</strong>“使你百姓中的穷人有吃的”表通过仁之良善与那些拥有少量真理，然而仍渴望接受教导的人结合。这从“吃”、“穷人”和“百姓”的含义清楚可知：“吃”是指交流和结合（参看<a href="2187.htm">2187</a>，<a href="3596.htm">3596</a>，<a href="5643.htm">5643</a>，<a href="8001.htm">8001</a>节）；“穷人”是指那些由于缺乏知识而拥有少量真理，却仍渴望接受教导的人（参看<a href="9253.htm">9253</a>节）；“百姓”，此处即以色列的百姓，是指那些属教会的人（<a href="4286.htm">4286</a>，<a href="6426.htm">6426</a>，<a href="6637.htm">6637</a>，<a href="8805.htm">8805</a>节）。从这些含义明显可知，“使你百姓中的穷人有吃的”表示与那些拥有少量真理，然而仍渴望接受教导的人结合。之所以说“通过仁之良善结合”，是因为这良善将人们结合在一起，这是在下一节论述的主题。</p>

<p align="center"><b>Potts(1905-1910) 9275</b></p><p><b>9275.</b>
And the needy of thy people shall eat. That this signifies conjunction through the good of charity with those who are in few truths and yet long to be instructed, is evident from the signification of 
"eating," as being communication and conjunction (see n. 2187, 3596, 5643, 8001); from the signification of "the needy," as being those who by reason of ignorance are in few truths and yet long to be 
instructed (see n. 9253); and from the signification of "people," here the people of Israel, as being those who are of the church (n. 4286, 6426, 6637, 8805). From all this it is evident that by "the 
needy of thy people shall eat," is signified the conjunction of the church with those who are in few truths and yet long to be instructed. The reason why it is said "conjunction through the good of charity," 
is that this good conjoins, as will be shown in the following article. </p>

<p align="center"><b>Elliott(1983-1999) 9275</b></p><p><b>9275.</b>
'And the needy of your people will eat' means being joined through the good of charity to those who possess few truths and still have a desire to receive instruction. This is clear from the meaning of 
'eating' as communicating and being joined together, dealt with in <a href="2187.htm">2187</a>, <a href="3596.htm">3596</a>, <a href="5643.htm">5643</a>, <a href="8001.htm">8001</a>; from the meaning of 'the needy' as those who have few truths owing to lack of knowledge and still have a desire 
to receive instruction, dealt with in <a href="9253.htm">9253</a>; and from the meaning of 'people', at this point the people of Israel, as those who belong to the Church, dealt with in <a href="4286.htm">4286</a>, <a href="6426.htm">6426</a>, <a href="6637.htm">6637</a>, <a href="8805.htm">8805</a>. From these 
meanings it is evident that 'the needy of your people will eat' means joining the Church to those who possess few truths and still have a desire to receive instruction. The reason why the words 'being 
joined through the good of charity' are used is that such good joins people together, which is the subject dealt with in the very next paragraph.  </p>

</p><b>9275.</b>
Et comedent egeni populi tui': quod significet conjunctionem per bonum charitatis cum illis qui in paucis veris sunt et usque desiderant instrui, constat ex significatione `comedere' quod sit communicatio 
et conjunctio, de qua n. 2187, 3596, 5643, 8001, et ex significatione `egenorum' quod sint qui in paucis veris ex ignorantia, et usque desiderant instrui, de qua n. 9253, et ex significatione `populi,' 
hic populi Israelis, quod sint qui ab Ecclesia, de qua n. 4286, (x)6426, 6637, 8805; ex quibus patet quod per `comedent egeni populi tui' significetur conjunctio Ecclesiae cum illis qui in paucis 
veris sunt et usque desiderant instrui; quod dicatur conjunctio per bonum charitatis, est quia id bonum conjungit, de qua in articulo nunc sequente. </p>
