<h3 align="center" class="ired">属天的奥秘 第3753节</h3>
<h4 align="center"></h4><p><strong>3753.</strong>凡怀着敬畏思想主，相信神性在祂里面，祂通过神性说话的人都能知道并相信，上面那些话，和主所教导并所说的其它话一样，并不只是论及一个民族，而论及全人类；也不是论及人类的世俗状况，而是论及其属灵状况；而且主的话包含构成其国度的事物和构成教会的事物，因为这些事物是神性，是永恒的。凡相信这些话的人都能推断出，“当那些日子，怀孩子的和奶孩子的有祸了”这句话不是指那些怀孩子的和奶孩子的；“你们要祷告，使你们的逃走不在冬天，也不在安息日”这句话也不是指因世俗的敌人而逃离等等。</p>

Everyone who thinks about the Lord with reverence and who believes that the Divine was in Him, and that He spoke from the Divine, is able to know and believe that the above words, like the rest the Lord 
taught and spoke, were not spoken of one nation only, but of the universal human race; and not of its worldly, but of its spiritual state; and also that the Lord's words comprehended the things which 
are of His kingdom and of the church, for these are Divine and eternal. Whoever believes in this manner, concludes that these words: "Woe unto them that are with child, and to them that give suck 
in those days," do not signify those who are with child and give suck; and that the words: "Pray ye that your flight be not in the winter, neither on the Sabbath," do not signify any flight on account 
of worldly enemies; and so in regard to the rest. </p>

Anyone who thinks with reverence about the Lord and who believes that the Divine was within Him and that He spoke from the Divine may know and believe that, as with everything else the Lord taught and 
said, those utterances do not refer to one particular nation but to the entire human race. Anyone may also know and believe that they do not refer to the worldly but to the spiritual condition of the 
human race, as well as that the Lord's words embraced the things that constitute His kingdom and those that constitute the Church, for those things are Divine and are eternal. One who believes these 
things concludes that the words 'Woe to those who are with child or giving suck in those days' do not mean those who are with child or giving suck, and that the words 'Pray that your flight may not take 
place in winter or on a sabbath' do not mean any flight on account of a worldly foe, and so on. </p>

</p><b>3753.</b>
Quisque qui sancte de Domino cogitat, et qui credit quod Divinum in Ipso fuerit, et quod ex Divino locutus sit, scire potest et credere quod illa, sicut reliqua quae Dominus docuit et locutus est, 
non de una gente dicta sint, sed de universo genere humano; et non de ejus statu mundano, sed de ejus statu spirituali; et quoque quod Domini verba {1}comprehenderint illa quae sunt regni Ipsius et quae 
sunt Ecclesiae, haec enim Divina sunt et aeterna. Qui ita credit, ille concludit quod haec verba, `Vae in utero gerentibus aut lactantibus in diebus illis' non significent illos qui in utero gerunt 
et lactant; et quod haec, `Orate ne fiat fuga vestra hieme, neque in sabbato' non significent fugam aliquam pro hoste mundano, et sic porro. @1 quia omnia Divina comprehenderint illa quae 
sunt totius Ipsius Regni in terris et in caelis et quae aeterna$ </p>
