<h4 align="center"></h4><p><strong>355.</strong>创世记4:5 只是看不中该隐和他的供物；该隐被大大地激怒，脸沉了下来。<br />如前所述，“该隐”表从爱分离之信，或认同有分离的可能这一类的教义；“看不中他的供物”依旧表示他的敬拜不被接受；“该隐被大大地激怒，脸沉了下来”表内在发生变化；“怒”表仁已丧失；“脸”表内在，当内在发生变化时，就说它“沉了下来”。</p>

But Cain and his offering he ignored. And anger kindled strongly in Cain, and his face fell.<br />Cain, as I said [<a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_355/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_325" target=_top>325-327</a>, <a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_355/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_337#subsection-2-3" target=_top>337:3</a>, <a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_355/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_338" target=_top>338</a>, <a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_355/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_340" target=_top>340-341</a>], symbolizes faith detached from love, or at least the kind of doctrinal view that allows faith to be detached. His offering and the fact that Jehovah ignored it has the same symbolism as before [<a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_355/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_345" target=_top>345</a>]: that his worship was not acceptable. The anger kindled in Cain and the falling of his face symbolize a change on the deeper levels; the anger means that charity took its leave, and his face symbolizes the deeper levels, which, when they change, are said to fall. </p>

Verse 5. But to Cain and his offering He looked not; and Cain's anger was kindled exceedingly, and his faces fell. By "Cain" as has been stated, is signified faith separated from love, or such a doctrine 
as admits of the possibility of this separation; by his "offering not being looked to" is signified as before that his worship was unacceptable. By "Cain's anger being kindled exceedingly, and his 
faces falling" is signified that the interiors were changed. By "anger" is denoted that charity had departed; and by the "faces" the interiors, which are said to "fall" when they are changed. </p>

<p align="center"><b>Elliott(1983-1999) 355</b></p><p><b>355.</b>
Verse 5 And for Cain and his gift He had no respect; and Cain's anger was set ablaze and his face' fell.  </p>
<p>'Cain', as has been stated, means faith separated from love, or the kind of doctrine which 
allows faith to be separated. 'His gift for which He had no respect' means, as previously, that his worship was unacceptable. 'Cain's anger was set ablaze and his face<A name="fntext1"></a><A href="#fn1"><sup>a</sup></a> fell' means a change as to interiors; 
'anger' means the fact that charity had departed, and 'face' the interiors, which are said 'to fall' when they undergo change.

Vers. 5.  Et ad Cain et ad munus ejus non aspexit; et accensa est ira Caino valde, et ceciderunt facies ejus.  Per 'Cain' significatur, ut dictum, fides separata ab amore, seu doctrina talis quod fides 
separari possit: per 'munus ejus quod non aspexit' significatur, ut prius, quod cultus ejus non acceptus esset: per 'iram accensam Caino,' et per 'facies quod ceciderint,' significatur quod mutata 
interiora; per 'iram' quod recesserit, charitas; et per 'faciem' interiora, quae 'cadere' dicuntur, cum mutantur. </p>
