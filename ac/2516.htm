<h3 align="center" class="ired">属天的奥秘 第2516节</h3>
<h4 align="center"></h4><p><strong>2516.</strong>“看哪，你要死了，因为你取了那女人来”表若就那教义的内容请教理性，那么信的教义必变得无效。这从此处“你”所指的“亚比米勒”、“死”和此处被称为“那女人”的“妹子”的含义清楚可知：“亚比米勒”是指信之教义；“死”是指变得无效；“妹子”是指理性（参看<a href="2508.htm">2508</a>节）。因此，亚比米勒因取了那女人来而要死了，是指若请教理性，信之教义必变得无效。<br />之所以不存在来自理性的信之教义，是因为理性处于善与真的表象中，这些表象本身并非真理，如前所示（<a href="2053.htm">2053</a>，<a href="2196.htm">2196</a>，<a href="2203.htm">2203</a>，<a href="2209.htm">2209</a>节）。而且，理性基于幻觉，幻觉是记忆知识所确认的外在感官印象的产物，而记忆知识则将这种朦胧的状态引入这些真理的表象。理性多半是纯粹的人性，这从它的出身也能清楚看出来。这就为何信之教义不可能始于理性，更不会通过它被构筑，而必须源于主的神性本身和祂的神圣人性。这就是它的来源，事实上完全来源于此，以致主就是教义本身。也正因如此，在圣言中，主被称为道（即圣言）、真理、光、道路、门。另外（这是一个奥秘），一切教义皆源于神性良善与神性真理，拥有天堂的婚姻在里面。里面没有该婚姻的教义不是信的真正教义，因此圣言作为教义的源头，其每个细节都具有婚姻的形像在里面（参看<a href="683.htm">683</a>，<a href="793.htm">793</a>，<a href="801.htm">801</a>节）。<br />就圣言的字义或外在意义而言，信之教义的确看似从理性，甚至从属世层所得良多。这是因为圣言是为了人而存在的，并以这种方式适合于人。但它本身是属灵的，来自属天的源头，即来自与神性良善结合的神性真理。若就教义的内容请教理性，教义必变得无效。这一事实可通过下文的例子来说明。</p>

<p align="center"><b>Potts(1905-1910) 2516</b></p><p><b>2516.</b>
Behold, thou wilt die because of the woman. That this signifies that the doctrine of faith would become null and void if the rational were consulted as to its contents, is evident from the signification 
of "Abimelech," who is here addressed, as being the doctrine of faith; from the signification of "dying," as being to become null and void; and from the signification of a "sister," who is here called 
"the woman," as being the rational (see n. 2508). Hence now by "Abimelech dying because of the woman" is signified that the doctrine of faith would become null and void if the rational were consulted. [2] 
The reason why there is no doctrine of faith from the rational, is that the rational is in appearances of good and truth, which appearances are not in themselves truths (as before shown, n. 
2053, 2196, 2203, 2209). Moreover the rational has under it fallacies which are from external sensuous things confirmed by memory-knowledges, which induce obscurity in these appearances of truth. The 
rational for the most part is merely human, as also is evident from its birth; and this is why nothing doctrinal of faith can begin from it, and still less be constructed from it; but must be from the 
Lord's Divine Itself and Divine Human. This is its origin, and indeed so entirely that the Lord is doctrine itself; on which account also in the Word He is called the Word, the Truth, the Light, the 
Way, the Door; and (what is an arcanum) all doctrine is from the Divine good and the Divine truth, and has in itself the heavenly marriage. Doctrine that has not this in it is not the genuine doctrine 
of faith. Hence it is that in all the particulars of the Word (the source of doctrine) there is an image of a marriage (see n. 683, 793, 801). [3] In the literal or external sense of the Word the doctrine 
of faith does indeed appear as if it possessed much from the rational, and even from the natural; but this is because the Word is for man, and has been in this manner accommodated to him; but 
still in itself it is spiritual from a celestial origin, that is, from Divine truth conjoined with Divine good. That doctrine would become null and void if as to its contents the rational were consulted, 
will be illustrated by examples in what follows. </p>

<p align="center"><b>Elliott(1983-1999) 2516</b></p><p><b>2516.</b>
'Behold, you will die because of the woman' means that the doctrine of faith would be ruined if the rational were consulted as regards the contents of that doctrine. This is clear from the meaning of 
Abimelech, to whom 'you' refers here, as the doctrine of faith; from the meaning of 'dying' as being brought to ruin; and from the meaning of 'a sister', called 'the woman' here, as the rational, dealt 
with in <a href="2508.htm">2508</a>. Consequently the statement that Abimelech would die because of the woman means that the doctrine of faith would be brought to ruin if the rational were consulted. </p>
<p></p>
<p><b>[2]</b>
 The reason no 
doctrine of faith from the rational exists is that the rational is immersed in the appearances of good and truth, and such appearances are not truths in themselves, as shown already in <a href="2053.htm">2053</a>, <a href="2196.htm">2196</a>, <a href="2203.htm">2203</a>, <a href="2209.htm">2209</a>. What is more, the rational bases itself on illusions, which are the product of external sensory impressions confirmed by facts which introduce haziness into those appearances of truth. The rational 
for the most part is merely human, as also becomes clear from its birth. This then is why nothing of the doctrine of faith can even be started, let alone be built up from it. Such doctrine must 
stem from the Lord's Divine itself and His Divine Human. This is the origin of it, so much so indeed that the Lord is doctrine itself. It is for this reason also that in the Word He is called the Word, 
the truth, the light, the way, and the door. Furthermore - and this is an arcanum - all doctrine is derived from Divine Good and Divine Truth and possesses the heavenly marriage within it. Doctrine 
which does not possess this within it is not the genuine doctrine of faith. Consequently every detail of the Word, the source of doctrine, holds the image of a marriage within it, see <a href="683.htm">683</a>, <a href="793.htm">793</a>, <a href="801.htm">801</a>. </p>
<p></p>
<p><b>[3]</b>
It does indeed seem in the literal or external sense of the Word as though the doctrine of faith possessed much from the rational and indeed from the natural. But the reason for this is that the 
Word exists for the sake of man, for whom it has been adapted in this way. Nevertheless in itself the Word is spiritual from a celestial origin, that is, it is derived from Divine Truth joined to Divine 
Good. The fact that doctrine would be brought to ruin if the rational were consulted as regards the contents of that doctrine will be illustrated by examples in what follows. </p>

Quod `ecce tu morieris propter mulierem' significet quo doctrina fidei nulla foret si quoad illa quae ibi, consuleretur rationale, constat ex significatione `Abimelechi' qui hic est `tu,' quod sit doctrina 
fidei; ex significatione `mori' quod sit nullum fieri; et a significatione `sororis' quae hic vocatur `mulier,' quod sit rationale, de qua n. 2508; [2] exhinc nunc, `quod Abimelech moreretur propter 
mulierem' (x)significat quod doctrina fidei nulla fieret si consuleretur rationale. Quod nulla doctrina fidei ex rationali, causa est quia rationale est in apparentiis boni et veri, quae apparentiae 
non sunt vera in se {1}, ut ostensum prius n. 2053, 2196, 2203, (x)2209: praeterea rationale sub se habet fallacias, quae sunt ex sensualibus externis confirmatis per scientifica, quae umbram inducunt 
istis veri apparentiis; est {2} rationale quoad maximam partem mere humanum, ut quoque ex ejus nativitate constare potest; inde nunc est quod ex illo nullum doctrinale fidei auspicari, minus condi 
possit; sed erit ex Ipso Divino (c)et Divino Humano Domini, inde ejus origo, et quidem in tantum ut Dominus sit ipsa doctrina, quare etiam in Verbo nominatur Verbum, (t)veritas, lux, via, {3} janua; 
et quod arcanum, omne doctrinae est ex Divino Bono et Divino Vero, et habet in se conjugium caeleste; doctrinale quod id in se non habet, non est doctrinale genuinum fidei; inde est quod in singulis 
Verbi, unde doctrina, sit instar conjugii, videatur n. 683, 793, 801.  [3] Apparet quidem doctrina fidei in sensu litterali seu externo Verbi, quod ex rationali multa habeat, immo ex naturali, sed hoc 
est ex causa quia Verbum est pro homine, cui sic accommodatum est, sed usque in se est spirituale ex origine caelesti, hoc est, ex Divino Vero conjuncto Divino Bono.  Quod doctrina nulla fieret si 
quoad illa quae ibi, consuleretur rationale, ab exemplis illustrabitur in sequentibus. 	@1 i sed modo apparent sicut vera.$ 	@2 estque.$ 	@3 i et.$ </p>
