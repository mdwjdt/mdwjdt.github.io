<h4 align="center"></h4><p><strong>65.</strong>当我读圣经时，一些人被提到天堂之门，他们从那与我对话，说他们不理会其中的文字，只看到它们所象征的内义，照他们所说，当中的内义是如此美妙，如此有序，如此感染其心，实堪称为“荣耀”。</p>

<p><strong>[NCE]65.</strong> Several people found themselves carried up into heaven's outermost entry hall while I was reading the Word, and they spoke to me from there. They said that they had no inkling of a single word or letter there but saw only the things symbolized on the next deeper level of meaning. These things, according to their description, were so beautiful, followed in such a perfect sequence, and affected them so deeply that they called it glory. </p>
<p align="center"><b>Potts(1905-1910) 65</b></p><p><b>65.</b>
Certain ones were taken up to the first entrance court of heaven, when I was reading the Word, and from there conversed with me. They said they could not there understand one whit of any word or letter 
therein, but only what was signified in the nearest interior sense, which they declared to be so beautiful, in such order of sequence, and so affecting them, that they called it Glory. </p>

<p align="center"><b>Elliott(1983-1999) 65</b></p><p><b>65.</b>
When I was reading the Word certain persons were brought into the outer court of heaven, and from there they spoke to me. They kept on saying that they did not understand the smallest detail of any word 
or letter in it, only what those things meant in the sense that lies next within it. They declared that these things were so beautiful, so arranged and ordered, and for them so moving, that they called 
them the glory.

</p><b>65.</b>
Quidam in primum atrium caeli sublati, cum legerem Verbum, et inde mecum locuti, dicebant quod ne hilum vocis aut litterae ibi intelligerent, sed solum quae in sensu proxime interiore significarent, 
quae praedicabant tam pulchra et in tali ordine sequentia et eos afficientia ut appellarent 'gloriam.' </p>
