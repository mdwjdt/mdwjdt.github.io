<h4 align="center"></h4><p><strong>4805.</strong>还有些内在友谊的社群，它们不会夺走别人的外在快乐，并将其转到自己这里，但会夺走别人的内在快乐，也就是对属灵事物的情感所赋予他的极乐。这些灵人位于前面，就在低地正上方的右边；其中有些灵人的位置比其他的稍高一点。我与位置在下的灵人有过几次交谈；每当这种时候，来自那些位置在上的灵人的一种总体流注就会流入。他们活在肉身时具有这样的性质：他们发自内心喜爱那些在他们的共同友谊里面的人，并以兄弟般的情感拥抱彼此。他们认为只有他们自己是活着的，并且住在光中；相比之下，那些在他们社群之外的人不是活着的，也不住在光中。他们因具有这种性质，故还以为主的天堂仅由他们这少数人组成。<br />但我蒙允许告诉他们说，主的天堂无穷无尽，是由各人民和各语言的人组成的；凡处于爱与信之良善的人都在天堂。我还指示他们说，天堂里的人都与身体的一切区域有关，无论外层部分还是内层部分。但是，他们若将心思放在超越他们的生活，与他们的生活不相符的任何事物上，尤其诅咒在他们社群之外的其他人，就不能拥有天堂。因为在这种情况下，他们的社群就是具有内在友谊的社群；而这种内在友谊具有这样的性质，他们一靠近他人，就会夺走他人属灵情感的极乐，如前所述。他们认为这些人不是选民，也不是活着的；这种思维一旦被交流，就带来悲伤。然而，根据次序的法则，在来世，这种悲伤会归到他们自己身上。</p>

There are also societies of interior friendship which do not take away another's external delight and divert it to themselves, but take away his internal delight or blessedness, arising from the affection 
of spiritual things. These societies are in front to the right close above the lower earth, and some of them a little higher. I have several times conversed with those who were below; and then those 
who were above inflowed in general. In the life of the body their nature was such that they loved from the heart those who were within their common fellowship, and also embraced one another with 
brotherly affection. They had believed that they only were living and in the light, and that those who were outside of their society were comparatively not living and not in the light; and because they 
were of such a quality they also thought that the Lord's heaven consists solely of those few.  [2] But it was given to tell them that the Lord's heaven is immense, and that it consists of every people 
and tongue, and that all are there who have been in the good of love and of faith; and it was shown that there are those in heaven who relate to all the provinces of the body both as to its exteriors 
 and as to its interiors; but that if they aspired beyond the things which correspond to their life, especially if they condemned others who were outside of their society, they could not have heaven; 
and that in this case their society is a society of interior friendship, which as before said is of such a nature that when they approach others they deprive them of the blessedness of spiritual affection; 
for they regard them as not being the elect, and as not living; and when this thought is communicated, it induces sadness, which however according to the law of order in the other life returns 
to themselves. </p>

<p align="center"><b>Elliott(1983-1999) 4805</b></p><p><b>4805.</b>
There are also communities of interior friendship which remove from another and channel to themselves not his external delight but his internal delight, that is, the bliss which his affection for spiritual 
things gives him. The position of those spirits is out in front, on the right immediately above the lower earth, though some of them are positioned somewhat higher up than the rest. I have spoken 
on several occasions to those in the lower position, and whenever I did so a general influx from those above took place. During their lifetime they were the kind of people who had a heartfelt love 
for others in their common fellowship and with brotherly feelings embraced one another. They had believed that they alone were living and in the light, and that compared with themselves those outside 
their community were neither living nor in the light. Being of this frame of mind they also imagined that the Lord's heaven was made up of their own few. </p>
<p></p>
<p><b>[2]</b>
 But I was allowed to tell them that the Lord's heaven is boundless and that it 
consisted of those from every people and language, and that all are in heaven in 
whom the good of love and faith has existed. I also showed them that those in 
heaven correlate with all the provinces of the body, both its exterior and its 
interior parts. But if their minds were set on anything beyond and out of 
keeping with their life, in particular if they were to condemn others outside 
their community, they could not receive heaven. For in this case their community 
is a community of interior friendship which, as has been stated, is such that 
when they get near others they dispossess them of the bliss which their 
spiritual affection gives them. They see these people as the ones who are not 
the elect and as those who are not living; and this thought, when it is 
communicated, leads to sadness. But in keeping with the law of order in the next 
life this sadness comes back to themselves. </p>

Sunt etiam societates interioris amicitiae, quae non jucundum externum alterius auferunt et ad se derivant, sed jucundum internum seu beatum ejus ex affectione spiritualium; illi antrorsum sunt ad 
dextrum prope super terram inferiorem, et quidam eorum supra aliquantum; cum illis qui infra erant, aliquoties locutus sum, et tunc illi qui supra, influebant in communi; illi fuerunt tales in vita 
corporis quod amaverint ex corde illos qui intra communem eorum consociationem fuerunt, et quoque fraternitate se mutuo amplexi; crediderant se solos vivos et in luce, et {1} qui extra eorum societatem 
respective quasi non vivos et non in luce; </p>
<p>et quia tales, etiam putarunt quod caelum Domini solum esset ex paucis illis; sed dicere eis datum est quod caelum Domini sit immensum, et quod consistat 
ex omni populo et lingua et quod ibi sint omnes qui in bono amoris et fidei fuerunt, et ostensum {2} quod sint in caelo qui referunt omnes provincias corporis quoad ejus exteriora et interiora; 
at si illi ultra aspirarent quam ad illa quae correspondent illorum vitae, quod non possent habere caelum; cumprimis si damnarent alios qui extra eorum societatem; et quod tunc societas eorum 
sit societas interioris amicitiae, quae talis, ut dictum, ut alios deprivent beato affectionis spiritualis quando ad illos appropinquant, spectant enim illos sicut non electos, et sicut non vivos, 
quae cogitatio communicata inducit triste, quod tamen secundum legem ordinis in altera vita, ad illos redit.      @1 at$      @2 i illis$ </p>
