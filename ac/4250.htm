<h3 align="center" class="ired">属天的奥秘 第4250节</h3>
<h4 align="center"></h4><p><strong>4250.</strong>“便把那与他同在的人口和羊群、牛群、骆驼分作分做两营”表对属世层里面真理与良善的预备和安排，以便接受“以扫”所代表的良善。这从“人口”（people，即人民或百姓）、“羊群”、“牛群”、“骆驼”和“营”的含义清楚可知：人口”（people，即人民或百姓）是指真理，也指虚假（参看<a href="1259.htm">1259</a>，<a href="1260.htm">1260</a>，<a href="3581.htm">3581</a>节）；“羊群”是指内层良善，以及并非良善的内层事物；“牛群”是指外层良善，以及并非良善的外层事物（<a href="2566.htm">2566</a>，<a href="4244.htm">4244</a>节）；“骆驼”是指外层或一般真理，以及并非真实的事物（<a href="3048.htm">3048</a>，<a href="3071.htm">3071</a>，<a href="3143.htm">3143</a>，<a href="3145.htm">3145</a>节）；“营”是指次序，在正面意义上是指纯正的次序，在反面意义上指并非纯正的次序（参看<a href="4236.htm">4236</a>节）。显然，“分作”在此表示一分为二，并且在一分为二时调整自己以便接受。<br />这一切的含义从刚才所述可以看出来。也就是说，当良善流入时，如次序正在颠倒，良善正占据第一位时的情形，属世层就会接受光，人在属世层里面就能看到何为纯正的真理或良善，何为不纯正的东西。在这种情况下，纯正的和非纯正的彼此区别如此之大，以致有些事物得以保留，有些则被移除；因此，次序变得完全不同于以前的样子。这就是良善掌管真理时的情形，因为那时真理无非是事奉者和仆人，并越来越照着天上的次序，以及通过真理对良善的接受程度，还有良善的品质而被排列；因为良善从真理取得自己的品质。</p>

And he halved the people that was with him, and the flock, and the herd, and the camels, into two camps. That this signifies the preparation and disposal of the truths and goods in the natural to receive 
the good represented by Esau, is evident from the signification of "people," as being truths, and also falsities (see n. 1259, 1260, 3581); from the signification of "flock," as being interior goods, 
and also things not good; from the signification of "herd," as being exterior goods, and also things not good (n. 2566, 4244); from the signification of "camels," as being exterior or general truths, 
and also things not true (n. 3048, 3071, 3143, 3145); and from the signification of "camps," as being order in a good sense genuine order, and in the opposite sense order not genuine (see n. 4236). 
That by "to halve" is here meant to divide into two, and thus to dispose one's self to receive, is manifest. How these things are circumstanced is evident from what was said just above, namely, that 
when good flows in, as is the case when the order is being inverted and good is taking the prior place, the natural is then enlightened, and it is seen what is genuine truth and good therein, and what 
not genuine; and the one kind is also discerned from the other, and thus some are retained, while others are removed; and hence the order becomes altogether different from what it had been before. 
For when good rules it is attended with this effect, because truths are then nothing but ministers and servants, and are disposed more and more nearly in accordance with heavenly order, according to the 
reception of good by truths, and also according to the quality of the good; for good takes its quality from truths. </p>

'And he split up the people who were with him, and the flocks and herds and camels, into two camps' means the preparation and arrangement of truths and goods within the natural so as to receive the good 
represented by 'Esau'. This is clear from the meaning of 'the people' as truths, and also as falsities, dealt with in <a href="1259.htm">1259</a>, <a href="1260.htm">1260</a>, <a href="3581.htm">3581</a>; from the meaning of 'flocks' as interior goods, and also interior 
things that are not good; from the meaning of 'herds' as exterior goods, and also exterior things that are not good, dealt with in <a href="2566.htm">2566</a>, <a href="4244.htm">4244</a>; from the meaning of 'camels' as exterior or general 
truths, and so also as things that are not true, dealt with in <a href="3048.htm">3048</a>, <a href="3071.htm">3071</a>, <a href="3143.htm">3143</a>, <a href="3145.htm">3145</a>; and from the meaning of 'a camp' as order - in the good sense genuine order and in the contrary sense order that 
is not genuine, dealt with in <a href="4236.htm">4236</a>. The fact that 'splitting up into two' means dividing in two and in so doing arranging oneself to receive is self-evident. </p>
<p></p>
<p><b>[2]</b>
 The implications of all this may be 
seen from what has been stated just above. That is to say, when good flows in, as happens when order is turned around and good takes up the first position, the natural receives light, and within the 
natural a person can see what genuine truth or good is and what that which is not genuine is. In this case genuine and non-genuine are so distinguished one from the other, that some things are retained 
while others are removed, as a consequence of which an altogether different order emerges from that which had existed previously. That is what happens when good has dominion over truth, for truths 
are then nothing else than ministers and servants, and they are arranged in ever closer conformity to heavenly order, to the reception of good by truths, and also to the character of the good, for good 
gets its specific character from truths. </p>

`Et dimidiavit populum qui cum eo, et gregem, et armentum, et camelos in duo castra': quod significet praeparationem et dispositionem verorum et bonorum in naturali ad recipiendum bonum per `Esavum' 
repraesentatum, constat a significatione `populi' quod sint vera, tum falsa, de qua n. 1259, 1260, 3581; ex significatione `gregis' quod sint bona interiora, et quoque non bona; ex significatione 
`armenti' quod sint bona exteriora, et quoque non bona, de quibus n. 2566, (o)4244; ex significatione `camelorum' quod sint vera exteriora seu communia, ita quoque non vera, de qua n. 3048, 3071, 
3143, 3145; et ex significatione `castrorum' quod sit ordo, in bono sensu ordo genuinus, et in opposito ordo non genuinus, de qua n. 4236; `dimidiare' quod sit dividere in bina, et sic se disponere 
ad recipiendum, patet.  [2] Haec quomodo se habent, constare potest ab illis quae mox supra dicta sunt, nempe cum bonum influit, ut fit cum invertitur ordo et bonum priorem locum sumit, quod tunc 
illustretur naturale, et inibi videatur quid genuinum verum et bonum et quid non genuinum, quae quoque {1} tunc discernuntur ab invicem, ita quod quaedam retineantur, quaedam autem removeantur, inde 
prorsus alius ordo fit quam qui prius fuerat; bonum enim cum dominatur, hoc secum habet, nam vera {2} tunc non aliud sunt quam ministri (c)et servi, et disponuntur secundum ordinem caelestem propius 
et propius, secundum receptionem boni a veris et quoque secundum qualitatem boni {3}, nam bonum suum quale accepit a veris.      @1 et quae$      @2 vera enim$      @3 verorum$ </p>
