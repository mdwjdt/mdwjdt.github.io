<h3 align="center" class="ired">属天的奥秘 第1977节</h3>
<h4 align="center"></h4><p><strong>1977.</strong>为让我充分了解梦是如何流入的，我睡着了，然后梦见一艘船驶来，上面满载各种美味佳肴。这些东西都藏在船里，看不见。甲板上站着两个警卫，还有第三个人，他是船长。这船驶入一个拱形码头。于是，我醒了，然后思想这个梦。这时，我上面右前方的天使灵向我说话，声称他们就是这梦的源头。为让我确信他们是这梦的源头，我被带入半睡半醒的状态。他们便以同样的方式引入各种快乐愉悦的事物，如一种未知的小生物，它被转变为一个黑色物体，带有闪亮的光线，这光线以惊人的速度射入我的左眼。他们还呈现出具有各种装饰的人和小孩子的样子，除此之外还有其它具有难以形容的快乐之物。我还与这些天使灵谈及这些事物。这种事不止发生一次，而是发生过多次，并且每次他们都用生动的声音指教我。<br />这类梦境起源于天堂花园入口处的天使灵。他们还负责看顾某些睡着的人，防止他们在睡着时被恶灵骚扰。他们十分乐意执行这项任务，以致他们会彼此争相去那里。他们喜欢用他们在这个人的情感和性情里面所看到的愉悦快乐之物充满他。那些成为天使灵的人活在肉身时，乐意并喜欢用尽一切方法，甚至承受极大痛苦去使别人的生活愉快。若人的听力被打开得足够远，他就会从他们，如同从远处那样听到甜美的节奏声，仿佛是歌声。他们说，他们并不知道诸如此类的事物从哪来，如此优美、快乐的代表物一瞬间就降临到他们身上。不过，他们被告知，这些事物出自天堂。他们属于小脑区，因为如我所知道的，当大脑睡着时，小脑在睡觉时也是醒着的。上古教会成员通过这一源头拥有梦境，连同对它们所表之物的直觉。古代的代表物和有意义的符号绝大部分源于这些人，深藏的事物在它们下面显明出来（<a href="1122.htm">1122</a>节）。</p>

In order that I might fully know how dreams flow in, I was put to sleep, and I dreamed that a ship came laden with delicacies and savory food of every kind. The things in the ship were not seen, but 
were stowed away. Upon the ship stood two armed guards, besides a third who was its captain. The ship passed into a kind of arched dock. So I awoke and thought about the dream. The angelic spirits, who 
were above in front to the right, then addressed me, and told me that they had introduced this dream; and in order that I might know with certainty that it was from them, I was put into a state as of 
sleep and at the same time of wakefulness; and they introduced in the same way various things that were pleasant and delightful; for instance, an unknown little animal which was dispersed in a likeness 
of blackish and shining rays, that darted with marvelous quickness into my left eye. They also presented men and also little children adorned in various ways; and other things besides, with inexpressible 
pleasantness, about which I also spoke with them. This was done, not once, but many times, and each time I was instructed by them with the living voice.  [2] The angelic spirits who are at the 
entrance to the paradisal scenes, are they who insinuate such dreams; and to them is also intrusted the duty of watching over certain men when they sleep, lest they should then be infested by evil spirits. 
They perform this duty with the greatest delight, so that there is rivalry among them as to who shall be present, and they love to affect the man with the enjoyable and delightful things which 
they see in his affection and genius. They who have become angelic spirits are from those who in the life of the body had delighted and had loved in every way and with the utmost pains, to make the life 
of others delightful. When the hearing is opened sufficiently far, there is heard from them, as from a distance, a sweetly modulated sound, as it were of singing. They said that they do not know whence 
such things, and representatives so beautiful and pleasant, come to them in a moment; but it was said that it was from heaven. They belong to the province of the cerebellum; for, as I have been 
informed, the cerebellum is awake in time of sleep, when the cerebrum sleeps. From this source the men of the Most Ancient Church had their dreams, together with a perception of what they signified; from 
whom in great part came the representatives and significatives of the ancients, under which were set forth things that are deeply hidden. </p>

To make me fully aware of the way that dreams flow in I was put to sleep and dreamt of a boat approaching that was laden with delicacies and savories of every kind. These were stowed away in the boat, 
out of sight. On deck stood two armed guards, as well as a third man who was the captain. The boat was passing by into a kind of arched dock; and with this I woke up and thought about the dream. At 
that point the angelic spirits in front and above me over to the right addressed me. They declared that they were the source of this dream. So that I would know for sure that they were the source of it 
I was brought into a state where I was so to speak both asleep and awake at one and the same time. In a similar way they introduced different things that were pleasing and delightful, for example, an 
unknown tiny creature which was transformed into an object with blackish and shining rays which shot into my left eye at a fantastic speed. They also presented human beings, and also small children 
variously adorned, and other things besides whose delightfulness was indescribable. I spoke to those angelic spirits about these things also. This took place not just once but on a number of occasions, 
and each time they taught me by word of mouth. </p>

 Those in whom such dreams originate are angelic spirits at the entrance to the paradise gardens. They are commissioned also to keep watch over certain 
people who are asleep, to prevent them being molested during that time by evil spirits. They perform their task with very great delight, so much so that they vie with one another to be there, and 
they love to fill man with joys and delights such as they see within his affection and disposition. Those who have become angelic spirits are drawn from those who during their lifetime took delight 
in and loved in every way to make other people's lives delightful. When a person's hearing has been opened far enough he hears as from afar a sweet rhythmic sound like singing coming from these spirits. 
They declared that they did not know from where such things as these, and representatives so beautiful and delightful, came to them all in a moment; but they were told that they came from heaven. 
They belong to the province of the cerebellum, for the cerebellum, as I have learned, remains awake even during periods of sleep when the cerebrum is sleeping. This was the source of the dreams, together 
with the perception of what these meant, which members of the Most Ancient Church had. And from those people were derived most of the representatives and meaningful signs of the Ancients, beneath 
which things deeply hidden were manifested, <a href="1122.htm">1122</a>. </p>

Ut scirem prorsus quomodo somnia influxerint, in somnum missus, et somniavi quod navis veniret cum omnis generis deliciosis et sapidis ad esum, quae in navi non visa sed recondita erant; super navi 
stabant bini vigiles armati, praeter tertium qui erat praefectus navis; transibat navis in quoddam navale cameratum {1}; sic evigilatus, et cogitavi de somnio; tunc alloquebantur me spiritus angelici 
qui superne antrorsum ad dextrum, et dicebant quod introduxerint hoc somnium: utque scirem pro certo quod inde, in statum missus sicut in somni et simul vigiliae, et varia quae amoena et deliciosa, similiter 
inferebant, sicut animalculum ignotum, quod dissipatum instar radiorum nigrescentium et splendentium, qui mirabili pernicitate involabant in oculum sinistrum; sistebant etiam homines, tum infantes 
varie decoratos, praeter alia cum amoenitate inexpressibili; de quibus etiam cum illis locutus.  Hoc factum non semel sed aliquoties, et toties ab illis viva voce instructus: [2] sunt illi spiritus 
angelici qui in limine ad paradisiaca sunt, qui talia somnia insinuant; quibus etiam munus vigilandi super quosdam homines cum dormiunt, injunctum est, ne a malis spiritibus tunc infestentur; hoc munus 
obeunt cum summa delectatione adeo ut aemulentur quinam adsint, et ament afficere hominem jucundis et deliciosis quae vident in ejus affectione et genio; sunt illi qui facti spiritus angelici ab 
illis qui in vita corporis delectati sunt et amaverant aliorum vitam facere jucundam omni modo et studio; quando aperitur auditus eo usque, auditur inde sicut e longinquo sonorum dulce modulans quasi 
cantus: dicebant quod non sciant unde iis talia et tam pulchra et amoena repraesentativa momento obveniant, sed dictum quod e caelo: pertinent ad provinciam cerebelli, quia cerebellum, ut instructus sum, 
tempore somni vigilat cum cerebrum dormit. Inde Antiquissimae Ecclesiae homines sua somnia habuerunt, cum perceptione quid significarent, a quibus quoad multam partem repraesentativa et significativa 
Antiquorum, sub quibus res alte reconditae sistebantur, [n. 1122.] 	@1 Cp. SD 3380 where this dream is described in almost the same words, but there it reads navis transibat sic in cameram.  Navale 
cameratum probably means `an arched dock.'$ </p>
