<h3 align="center" class="ired">属天的奥秘 第876节</h3>
<h4 align="center"></h4><p><strong>876.</strong>“就回到方舟挪亚那里”表良善与真理在他身上显现，似乎是信之良善与真理。这一点从上下文清楚可知。就内义而言，“回到方舟”并非表释放。“放出鸽子，鸽子就再没有回到他那里”才表释放，这从下文明显看出来，下文经上说“他放出鸽子，鸽子就再没有回到他那里”（8:12）；他被吩咐出方舟（8:15-16）；他出来了（8:18）。“方舟”表该教会成员重生前的状态。他在方舟里，就是被囚禁，或坐监，被恶与假，即洪水四面围困。所以，“回到方舟挪亚那里”表鸽子所指的良善与真理又回到他那里。凡人以为他凭自己所行之善都会回到他那里，因为它意在自我。他行善要么是为了在这个世界面前，或在天使面前表现，要么为了配得天堂，或在天堂里成为最大的。这类动机就在人的自我中心里面，在其每一个念头中，尽管它们表面上看似信之良善与真理。信之良善与真理通过至内在而成为内在的良善与真理，也就是说，一切信之良善与真理都是从主那里经由人的至内在而流入的。但是，若它们从自我中心，或功德心那里流出，那么内在就是污秽的，而外在看似洁净。它们就象长着漂亮脸蛋的肮脏妓女，或象黑人，更确切地说，象裹着白衣的埃及木乃伊。</p>

<p><strong>[NCE]876.</strong> The symbolism of it returned to him, to the ark, as goodness and truth that seemed to be religious can be seen from statements above [<a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_876/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_874" target=_top>874</a>] and just below.<br />Liberation is symbolized on an inner level not by the dove's return to the ark but by its being sent from the ark and not returning, as indicated by what follows. Verse <a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_876/bible_king-james-version_genesis_8_12" target=_top>12</a>., for instance, says that Noah sent the dove out and it never returned to him again. Verses <a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_876/bible_king-james-version_genesis_8_15-16" target=_top>15-16</a>. say that he himself was ordered to leave the ark, and verse <a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_876/bible_king-james-version_genesis_8_18" target=_top>18</a>, that he did.<br />The ark symbolizes the circumstances of these people before rebirth. Under such circumstances they were captives or prisoners, beset on all sides by evil and falsity, or by the flood waters. So returning to Noah, to the ark, signals the relapse of goodness and truth (as meant by the dove) into that condition.<br />Anything good we intend to do when motivated by self-interest comes back to us, because it focuses on us; we want the world or the angels to see what we are doing, or we desire to earn a place in heaven, or we hope to be the greatest in heaven. Those are the urges inherent in self-interest and in every idea connected with it, however convincing the outer appearance of religious goodness and truth. The goodness and truth that faith embraces is good and true inside, from the very core; that is, the goodness and truth of faith comes entirely from the Lord by way of our deepest levels. When it comes instead from ourselves, or depends on our merits, it is dirty on the inside although apparently clean on the outside, just like a foul-smelling prostitute with a beautiful-looking face or like an Ethiopian person, or rather an Egyptian mummy, dressed in white clothing.{*1} <br /><strong>Footnotes:</strong><br />{*1} The contrast Swedenborg is apparently trying to make here is one of darker and lighter color as corresponding to moral evil and goodness. Swedenborg first selects an Ethiopian person as an image of blackness to be contrasted with white clothing; he then switches to what he apparently considered an even blacker image: an Egyptian mummy, which would add the further factors of grotesqueness and death. For other passages in which Swedenborg mentions the blackness of Ethiopians, see <a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_876/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_3540" target=_top>Secrets of Heaven 3540:1</a>; Revelation Explained [Swedenborg 1994-1997] <a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_876/swedenborg_apocalypse-explained-whitehead_780#subsection-2-5" target=_top>780:5</a>; for passages where he mentions the blackness of mummies, see <a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_876/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_817" target=_top>Secrets of Heaven 817</a>; <a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_876/swedenborg_apocalypse-revealed-rogers_153#subsection-2-12" target=_top>Revelation Unveiled 153:12</a>; <a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_876/swedenborg_true-christian-religion-chadwick_595" target=_top>True Christianity 595:1</a>. This is not to say that Swedenborg had a low opinion of black Africans, however; he elsewhere accords them higher praise than the other races of the earth including his own; see <a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_876/swedenborg_conjugial-love-rogers_114" target=_top>Marriage Love 114</a> in the context of <a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_876/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_103" target=_top>103-114</a>.

And she returned unto him to the ark. That this signifies good and truth appearing as though they were of faith, is evident from what has been said, and also from what follows. In the internal sense, 
to "return to the ark" does not signify liberation, for this is signified by being sent forth from the ark and not returning, as is evident from what follows, in the twelfth verse, that he sent forth 
the dove and she returned not again to him anymore; and further from the fifteenth and sixteenth verses, that Noah was commanded to go forth from the ark; and from the eighteenth, that he went forth. 
The "ark" signifies the state of the man of this church before regeneration, in which he was in captivity, or in prison, beset on all sides by evils and falsities, or by the waters of the flood. And 
so the dove's returning unto Noah to the ark, signifies that the good and truth meant by the dove returned again to the man. For whatever good a man supposes that he does from himself, returns to him, 
since it regards himself; as he does it either that it may appear before the world, or before the angels, or that he may merit heaven, or that he may be greatest in heaven. Such things are in man's Own 
and in everyone of its ideas, though in outward form there is an appearance as of the good and truth of faith. The good and truth of faith is inwardly good and true from the very inmosts; that is, 
all the good and truth of faith flows in from the Lord through man's inmosts. But when what a man does is from his Own, or from merit, then the interiors are filthy and the exteriors appear clean; just 
as with a filthy harlot who appears fair in the face; or like an Ethiopian, or rather an Egyptian mummy, wrapped in a white garment. </p>

<p align="center"><b>Elliott(1983-1999) 876</b></p><p><b>876.</b>
'It returned to him to the ark' means good and truth appearing to be the good and truth of faith [with him]. This is clear from what has been stated already and also from what follows. 'Returning to 
the ark' does not in the internal sense mean being set free. 'Being sent out of the ark and not returning' is what has that meaning, as is clear from what follows, where it is said that he sent out the 
dove and it came back to him no more, verse 12; that he was commanded to leave the ark, verses 15, 16; and that he went out, verse 18. While he was inside the ark, which means his state prior to regeneration, 
he was in captivity or prison, hemmed in on every side by evils and falsities, which are 'the flood-waters'. Consequently 'it returned to him to the ark' means that good and truth meant by 
the dove came back to him again. Any good at all which a person supposes that he does from himself comes back to him, for it has self in view. He does it either to be seen by the eyes of the world, or 
by those of the angels, or he does it to merit heaven, or to be the greatest in heaven. Such considerations occupy his proprium and every one of his ideas, though to outward appearance they look like 
the good and truth of faith. The good and truth of faith are inwardly good and true from what is inmost, that is, all good and truth of faith flow in from the Lord by way of what is inmost in man. But 
when they flow from the proprium or from merit-seeking the interiors are filthy while the exteriors appear clean. They are like a diseased prostitute with a beautiful face; or like a black-skinned person, 
or more appropriately an Egyptian mummy, dressed in white. </p>

Quod 'reversa ad illum ad arcam' significet bonum et verum apparens quasi fidei, ex illis quae dicta sunt, constat, tum ex quae sequuntur: 'reverti ad arcam' in sensu interno non significat liberationem, 
sed 'emitti ab arca et non redire,' ut constat ab illis quae sequuntur, ut vers. 12, quod 'emiserit columbam, et non addiderit redire ad illum amplius'; tum a vers. 15 et 16, quod 'jussus exire 
ab arca,' et a vers. 18, quod 'exiverit.' 'Arca' significat statum ejus ante regenerationem, in qua cum fuit, in captivitate aut in carcere fuit, obsessus undique a malis et falsis, seu ab 'aquis diluvii'; 
quare 'quod reversa ad illum ad arcam' significat quod bonum et verum per 'columbam' intellectum rursus ad illum rediret; quicquid boni homo ex semet facere putat, hoc ad illum redit, nam spectat 
ipsum; vel facit illud ut coram mundo appareat, vel ut coram angelis, vel ut mereatur caelum, vel ut maximus sit in caelo; talia proprio et unicuivis ejus ideae insunt, tametsi appareat in externa forma 
sicut bonum et verum fidei; bonum et verum fidei est intus bonum et verum ab intimis, hoc est, per intima hominis a Domino influit omne bonum et verum fidei; at cum a proprio seu ex merito, tunc 
interiora sunt spurca, et exteriora apparent munda prorsus sicut putida meretrix quae facie apparet venusta; aut sicut Aethiops vel potius Aegyptiorum mumia candida veste circum induta. </p>
