<h4 align="center"></h4><p><strong>3743.</strong>然而，没有对主之爱和对邻之爱，因而没有良善与真理的生命之人不能承认唯一的生命是流入的，更不能承认这生命出自主。所有这类人当被告知他们不是凭自己活着时，很是愤怒，甚至感到厌恶。自我之爱就是造成这一切的原因；说来奇怪，在来世，哪怕以活生生的经历向他们显明，他们不是凭自己活着，哪怕当时他们声称自己已确信这一真理，然而后来他们仍坚持原来的观点，以为若是通过别人，而不是通过自己活着，其生命的一切快乐就都消失了。殊不知，情况恰恰相反。<br />因此，恶人将恶归给自己，因为他们不相信恶源于地狱；善也无法被归给他们，因为他们相信善来自他们自己，而不是来自主。尽管如此，恶人，以及凡在地狱的，都是接受主之生命的形态，不过是诸如要么拒绝，要么窒息，要么败坏良善与真理的那类形态；因此，来自主之生命的良善与真理在他们身上就变成了邪恶与虚假。这就像阳光，它尽管是单一和白亮的，然而当照射或流入不同物体时，仍会发生种种变化，从而产生美丽和宜人的色彩，以及丑陋和讨厌的色彩。</p>

<p align="center"><b>Potts(1905-1910) 3743</b></p><p><b>3743.</b>
But they who are not in love to the Lord and toward their neighbor, consequently who are not in the life of good and truth, are not able to acknowledge that there is only one influent life, and still 
less that this life is from the Lord. But all such are indignant, nay, feel aversion, when it is said that they do not live from themselves. The love of self is the cause of this; and wonderful to say, 
although shown by living experience in the other life that they do not live from themselves, and although being at the time convinced they say that it is so, yet afterwards they persist in the same 
opinion, and imagine that if they lived from another, and not from themselves, all the delight of their life would perish; for they are not aware that the reverse is the truth. For this reason the wicked 
appropriate evil to themselves, because they do not believe that evils are from hell; and good cannot be appropriated to them, because they believe good to be from themselves, and not from the Lord. 
Nevertheless the wicked, and also those in hell, are forms recipient of life from the Lord, but such forms that they either reject, or suffocate, or pervert good and truth; and thus the goods and 
truths which are from the Lord's life become with them evils and falsities. The case herein is like that of the light of the sun, which although single and white, is yet varied as it passes through or 
flows into various forms, and thereby produces beautiful and pleasing colors, as well as those which are not beautiful and not pleasing. </p>

<p align="center"><b>Elliott(1983-1999) 3743</b></p><p><b>3743.</b>
People however in whom love to the Lord and love towards the neighbour are not present, nor consequently the life of good and truth, are incapable of acknowledging that but one life alone flows in, let 
alone that this life comes from the Lord. But all such persons are incensed, indeed they are repelled, when told that they do not live of themselves. Self-love is what causes this. And what is amazing, 
although those people are shown by actual experiences in the next life that they do not live of themselves and at those times say that they are convinced of the truth of it, they nevertheless subsequently 
cling to their same old opinion and imagine that if they did live from another and not from themselves every joy of their life would melt away - unaware that quite the contrary is the case. </p>
<p></p>
<p><b>[2]</b>
Consequently the evil make evil their own because they do not believe that evils originate in hell; and they are incapable of making good their own because they believe that good begins in themselves 
and not from the Lord. Even so, the evil, as also those in hell, are recipient forms of life from the Lord, but they are forms such as either reject, or stifle, or pervert what is good and true; 
and so with them goods and truths, which come with the Lord's life, are turned into evils and falsities. It is like the light of the sun. Although that light is one alone and white it is nevertheless 
made varied as it strikes different objects, that is, flows into them, producing colours that are beautiful and pleasant, and also those that are hideous and unpleasant. </p>

</p><b>3743.</b>
Qui autem non in amore in Dominum et in amore erga proximum sunt, consequenter non in vita boni ac veri, illi non agnoscere possunt quod unica vita sit quae influit, et minus quod illa vita sit a 
Domino; sed omnes illi indignantur immo aversantur cum dicitur quod non vivant a se; amor sui est qui id facit; et quod mirum, tametsi illis per vivas experientias in altera vita ostenditur quod non 
vivant a se, et tunc convicti {1}dicunt quod ita sit, usque tamen postea in eadem opinione perstant et putant quod si ab alio viverent, et non a se, omne jucundum vitae eorum periret, non scientes 
quod prorsus contrarium sit. [2] Inde est quod mali approprient sibi malum quia non credunt quod mala sint ab inferno, et quod non appropriari illis possit bonum quia credunt bonum esse a se, et 
non a Domino. At usque mali, et quoque infernales, sunt formae recipientes vitae a Domino, sed tales formae ut bonum et verum vel rejiciant, vel suffocent, vel pervertant; et sic apud illos bona et 
vera, quae sunt ex vita Domini, fiunt mala et falsa; se habet hoc sicut lux solis, quae tametsi unica et candida, usque sicut per formas percurrit, seu in illas influit, variatur, inde colores pulchri 
et jucundi, et quoque impulchri et injucundi. @1 after sit$ </p>
