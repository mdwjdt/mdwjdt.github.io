<h3 align="center" class="ired">属天的奥秘 第7835节</h3>
<h4 align="center"></h4><p><strong>7835.</strong>“就叫他和他家隔壁的邻舍共取一只”表与最近的真理之良善结合。这从“取”和“他家隔壁的邻舍”的含义清楚可知：“取”，也就是与他隔壁的邻舍共取一只羔羊，是指结合；“他家隔壁的邻舍”是指最近的真理之良善。“隔壁邻舍”表示最近的，这是显而易见的；“家”表示良善（参看<a href="7833.htm">7833</a>节）。之所以说“真理之良善”，是因为所论述的主题是那些属于属灵教会的人，他们中间的良善是真理之良善；因为真理之良善存在于意愿和行为中。事实上，当信之真理与仁之情感一起被接受时，它就被植入心智的内层；当真理再现时，与该真理联结的情感也会再现，并以良善的形式显现。正因如此，这个教会的良善是真理之良善，也就是所谓的属灵良善。</p>

<p align="center"><b>Potts(1905-1910) 7835</b></p><p><b>7835.</b>
Then shall he and his neighbor near unto his house take. That this signifies conjunction with the nearest good of truth, is evident from the signification of "taking," namely, with his near neighbor 
one lamb together, as being conjunction; and from the signification of "a neighbor near unto his house," as being the nearest good of truth. That "a near neighbor" denotes what is nearest, is manifest; 
and that "house" denotes good, see above (n. 7833). It is said "the good of truth," because those who are of the spiritual church are treated of, with whom is the good of truth; for the good of truth 
is truth in will and act. For when the truth of faith is received along with the affection of charity, it is implanted in the interiors of the mind; and when the truth is reproduced, the affection also 
to which the truth was adjoined is reproduced, and appears under the aspect of good. Hence it is that the good of this church is the good of truth, which is also called spiritual good. </p>

<p align="center"><b>Elliott(1983-1999) 7835</b></p><p><b>7835.</b>
'Then he and his neighbour immediately next to his house shall take one' means being joined to the nearest good of truth. This is clear from the meaning of 'taking' - that is, taking along with one's 
immediate neighbour, a single animal - as being joined together; and from the meaning of 'neighbour next to his house' as the nearest good of truth. The meaning of 'immediate neighbour' as the nearest 
is self-evident; and for the meaning of 'house' as good, see above in <a href="7833.htm">7833</a>. The term 'good of truth' is used because those belonging to the spiritual Church are the subject, and with them good is the 
good of truth, the good of truth being truth present in will and action. For when the truth of faith is received together with charitable affection it is implanted in the inward parts of the mind. And 
when that truth presents itself again, the affection to which that truth has been linked presents itself too, appearing in the form of good. So it is then that good in that Church is the good of truth, 
which is also called spiritual good. </p>

`Et accipiet ille et vicinus illius propinquus ad domum ejus': quod significet conjunctionem cum bono veri {1}proximo, constat ex significatione `accipere,' nempe cum vicino {2}propinquo unam pecudem 
simul, quod sit conjunctio; et ex significatione `vicini propinqui ad domum ejus' quod sit bonum veri proximum; quod `vicinus propinquus' sit proximus, patet; et quod `domus' sit bonum, videatur supra 
n. 7833; bonum veri dicitur quia agitur de illis qui ab Ecclesia spirituali, apud quos est bonum veri, {3}nam bonum veri est verum voluntate et actu; cum enim verum fidei recipitur cum affectione quae 
charitatis, tunc implantatur illud in interioribus mentis, et {4}cum reproducitur verum, etiam affectio cui verum adjunctum fuit reproducitur, et sub facie boni apparet; inde nunc est quod bonum illius 
Ecclesiae sit bonum veri, quod etiam vocatur bonum spirituale. 	@1 proximi$ 	@2 proximo$ 	@3 quod in se$ 	@4 facit ibi sicut voluntarium, quare cum reproducitur verum, etiam affectio quae est 
illius voluntarii$ </p>
