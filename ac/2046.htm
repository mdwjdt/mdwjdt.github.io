<h3 align="center" class="ired">属天的奥秘 第2046节</h3>
<h4 align="center"></h4><p><strong>2046.</strong>“一切男子”表那些拥有信之真理的人。这从“男子”的含义清楚可知，“男子”是指真理，如前所述（<a href="672.htm">672</a>，<a href="749.htm">749</a>节）。此处之所以提及表示信之真理的男子，是因为除了由真理所主导的人外，没人能从这些污秽的爱中得以洁净。他凭真理认识何为纯洁、何为不洁，以及何为神圣，何为亵渎。没有这类认知，就没有任何渠道或媒介以使从主不断流入的天堂之爱能进入其中并经由它运作，因为这天堂之爱只能在真理中被接受。因此，人藉由信的认知被改造和重生，不过，这一切在他具有这类认知之前是不会发生的。良知本身藉由信之真理形成，因为重生之人所具有的良知是对何为真理、何为正义的良知。关于这个问题，可参看前文（<a href="977.htm">977</a>，<a href="986.htm">986</a>节末尾，<a href="1033.htm">1033</a>，<a href="1076.htm">1076</a>，<a href="1077.htm">1077</a>节）。这也是为何石头刀，或“火石剑”（如它们被称谓的）用于割礼的原因。“火石剑”表示真理，对此，可参看前文（<a href="2039.htm">2039</a>节末尾）。</p>

Every male. That this signifies those who are in the truth of faith, is evident from the signification of a "male," as being truth (concerning which, see n. 672, 749). The "male:"," by which is signified 
the truth of faith, is named here because no one can be purified from those filthy loves except one who is in truth. From truth he knows [cognoscit] what is pure and what impure, and what is holy 
and what profane. Before he has learned this, there are no mediums into which and through which the heavenly love continually flowing in from the Lord can operate, as this cannot be received except in 
truths; and therefore man is reformed and regenerated by means of the knowledges of truth, and this not until he has been imbued with them. Conscience itself is formed by means of the truths of faith; 
for the conscience with which the regenerate man is gifted is a conscience of what is true and right (see n. 977, 986 at the end, 1033, 1076, 1077). This also is the reason why knives of stone, or 
"swords of rocks," as they are called, were employed in circumcising. (That these signify truths may be seen above, n. 2039, at the end.) </p>

<p align="center"><b>Elliott(1983-1999) 2046</b></p><p><b>2046.</b>
'Every male' means those who possess the truth of faith. This is clear from the meaning of 'a male' as truth, dealt with in <a href="672.htm">672</a>, <a href="749.htm">749</a>. The reason why the word 'male', meaning the truth of faith, is used 
is that nobody can be purified from those filthy loves except the person who is governed by truth. From truth he recognizes what is pure or impure, and what is holy or unholy. Until he possesses such 
knowledge there are no channels into which and through which heavenly love flowing in constantly from the Lord is able to operate, for it cannot be received except within truths. It is by means of 
cognitions of truth therefore that a person is reformed and regenerated, but this does not take place before he has been endowed with them. Conscience itself is formed by means of the truths of faith, 
for the conscience with which a regenerate person is endowed is a conscience for what is true and right. On this matter see <a href="977.htm">977</a>, <a href="986.htm">986</a> (end), <a href="1033.htm">1033</a>, <a href="1076.htm">1076</a>, <a href="1077.htm">1077</a>. This also is the reason why flint knives, 
or 'swords of flint', as they are called, were used for circumcision. 'Swords of flint' means truths, see above <a href="2039.htm">2039</a> (end). </p>

Quod `omnis masculus' significet illos qui in vero fidei sunt, constat a significatione `masculi' quod sit verum, de qua n. 672, 749; quod `masculus' dicatur per quem significatur verum fidei, causa 
est quia nemo purificari potest ab amoribus illis spurcis nisi qui in vero est; ex vero cognoscit quid est purum et impurum, et quid sanctum et profanum; antequam hoc novit non sunt media in quae et 
per quae operari potest amor caelestis qui continue (t)influit a Domino, qui non recipi potest nisi in veris; quare per cognitiones veri reformatur et regeneratur homo, et hoc non prius quam cum illis 
imbutus est; ipsa conscientia per vera fidei formatur, nam conscientia est veri et recti qua regeneratus donatur, de qua videatur, n. 977, 986 fin., 1033, 1076, 1077; haec causa etiam est quod cultri 
lapidei seu gladii petrarum, ut vocantur, ad circumcisionem adhiberentur, per quos quod significentur vera, videatur supra n. 2039 ad fin. </p>
