<h3 align="center" class="ired">属天的奥秘 第9333节</h3>
<h4 align="center"></h4><p><strong>9333.</strong>“我不在一年之内将他们从你面前撵出去”表它们的逃跑，或移走它们，就是移走迦南地的各个民族所表示的邪恶和虚假，不是仓促之间完成的。这从“撵出去”和“一年之内”的含义清楚可知：“撵出去”是指逃跑，因为在来世，那些陷入邪恶和虚假的人不是被赶出去的，而是自动逃跑的（也表示移走，可参看下文）；“一年之内”是指仓促之间，因为经上在下文说：“我要渐渐地将他们从你面前撵出去”，意思是照秩序逐渐移走。<br />当论及“邪恶和虚假”时，“撵出去”之所以表示移走，是因为邪恶和虚假不是从一个人那里被赶出去的，而是被移走的。凡不知道人摆脱邪恶和虚假，或他的罪得赦免是怎么回事的人，都以为当说罪被赦免时，它们就被抹除了。圣言的字义以这种方式说过几次，导致人们如此思想。结果，许多人的头脑被一种错误观念占据，即：他们获得赦免之后就是公义的、纯洁的。但是，这些人对罪得赦免的方式或说真正性质一无所知。他们不知道，没有人从罪中洁净；相反，当人们具有这种性质，即他们能被保持在良善和真理中时，他们被主从罪中阻止；当他们已经重生时，就能被保持在良善和真理中；因为那时他们获得了仁之良善和信之真理的生命。一个人从小所思所愿、所言所行的一切事，都被添加到他的生命中，并构成他的生命。这些事物无法被根除，只能被移走；当它们被移走时，此人就觉得自己似乎没有罪了，因为它们已经被移走了（<a href="8393.htm">8393</a>，<a href="8988.htm">8988</a>e，<a href="9014.htm">9014</a>节）。当圣言说，一个人从罪中洁净，以及成为公义时，它是照表象说的；根据表象，人凭自己思考并实行良善和真理；而事实上，他不是凭自己，而是靠主的帮助而如此行；如在以赛亚书：<br />你们的罪虽像朱红，必变白如雪；虽红如丹颜，必如羊毛。（以赛亚书<a href="http://39-27.cn/赛1.18.htm">1:18</a>）<br />类似的话在其它地方说过多次。我被恩准从来世的灵魂得以知道这一切都是千真万确的。所有人都将构成他们生命的一切，也就是他们所思所愿、所言所行的任何事，甚至他们从小直到在世生命的最后阶段所耳闻目睹的任何事从这个世界带到来世，就连最细微的细节也不会缺失（<a href="2474.htm">2474</a>节）。这时，那些在世上过着一种信与仁的生活之人就能远离邪恶，被保持在良善中，从而被提入天堂。然而，那些在世上没有过一种信与仁的生活，而是过着一种爱自己爱世界的生活之人就会沉入地狱，因为他们无法摆脱邪恶，被保持在良善中。由此明显可知为何当“撵出去”论及虚假和邪恶时，它表示移走。在这一节和下一节，这种移走就是内义上所论述的主题；它的奥秘会在那里被揭示。</p>

<p align="center"><b>Potts(1905-1910) 9333</b></p><p><b>9333.</b>
I will not drive him out from before thee in one year. That this signifies no hasty flight or removal of them, namely, of the falsities and evils which are signified by the nations in the land of Canaan, 
is evident from the signification of "driving out," as being flight, for in the other life those who are in evils and falsities are not driven out, but flee of themselves (that removal also is signified 
will be seen below); and from the signification of "in one year," as being what is hasty; for the words follow, "by little and little I will drive him out from before thee," by which is signified 
removal by degrees according to order.  [2] That when predicated of evils and falsities, "to drive out" denotes removal, is because falsities and evils are not driven out from a man, but are removed. 
He who does not know how the case is with man's liberation from evils and falsities, or with the forgiveness of his sins, may believe that sins are wiped away when they are said to be forgiven. This 
belief comes from the literal sense of the Word, where such an expression is sometimes used, giving rise in the minds of many to the error that after they have received absolution they are righteous 
and pure. But these people know nothing whatever about the way in which sins are forgiven; namely, that a man is not purified from them; but is withheld from them by the Lord when he is of such a character 
that he can be kept in good and truth; and that he can be kept in good and truth when he has been regenerated; for he has then acquired a life of the good of charity and the truth of faith. For 
whatever a man, from his earliest infancy, thinks, wills, speaks, and does, is added to his life and makes it. These things cannot be exterminated, but only removed, and when they are removed, the 
man appears as if he were devoid of sins, because they have been removed (n. 8393, 8988, 9014). In accordance with the appearance that man thinks and does what is good and true from himself, when yet 
it is not from himself but from the Lord, it has been said in the Word that he is "clean" from sins, and also "righteous;" as in Isaiah: </p>
<p>     Though your sins have been as scarlet, they shall be as white 
as snow; though they have been red like crimson, they shall be as wool (Isa. 1:18); </p>
<p>and in many other passages. [3] That such is the case has been granted me to know from the state of souls in 
the other life. Everyone brings with him there from the world all things of his life, that is, whatsoever he has thought, wished, spoken, and done; and even whatever he has seen and heard from his infancy 
down to the end of his life in the world, insomuch that there is not even the smallest thing lacking (n. 2474). Those who in the world have lived a life of faith and charity, can then be withheld 
from evils and kept in good, and thus be raised into heaven. But those who in the world have not led a life of faith and charity, but a life of the love of self and of the love of the world, sink down 
into hell, because they cannot be withheld from evils and kept in good. From all this it is evident why, when "driving out" is said in relation to falsities and evils, it denotes removal. In this verse 
and the next this removal is treated of in the internal sense, and its arcana are there disclosed. </p>

<p align="center"><b>Elliott(1983-1999) 9333</b></p><p><b>9333.</b>
'I will not drive them out from before you in one year' means no hurried flight or removal of them, that is to say, of the falsities and evils meant by the nations in the land of Canaan. This is clear 
from the meaning of 'driving out' as flight, for those in the next life who are steeped in evils and falsities are not driven out but flee of their own accord (the fact that removal is also meant will 
be seen below); and from the meaning of 'in one year' as that which is hurried, for the words follow, 'Little by little I will drive them out from before you', meaning a gradual removal in keeping 
with order.  </p>
<p></p>
<p><b>[2]</b>
 The reason why 'driving out', when it has reference to evils and falsities, means removal is that falsities and evils are not driven out of a person but removed. Anyone who does not 
know the true nature of human deliverance from evils and falsities, which is the forgiveness of sins, thinks that sins are wiped out when they are said to have been forgiven. The literal sense of the 
Word which speaks several times in that kind of way leads people to think so. As a result of this the minds of very many people have been taken over by the erroneous idea that they are righteous and 
pure after they have received absolution. But they have no knowledge whatever of the true nature of the forgiveness of sins. They do not know that no one is purified from sins; rather people are withheld 
from them by the Lord when they are such that they can be maintained in goodness and truth, and they can be maintained in goodness and truth when they have been regenerated, because then they have 
acquired the life of the good of charity and of the truth of faith. All that a person thinks, intends, says, and does from earliest childhood enters into the composition of his life. Those things cannot 
be banished, only removed; and when they are removed it seems as though the person is without sins, because they have been removed, see <a href="8393.htm">8393</a>, <a href="8988.htm">8988</a> (end), <a href="9014.htm">9014</a>. The Word speaks in keeping with the 
appearance that a person thinks and does what is good and true unaided, by himself (the reality being that he does so not by himself but with the Lord's aid) when it says that he is free from sins, and 
also is righteous, as for instance in Isaiah,  </p>
<blockquote>
Though your sins are like scarlet, they will be as white as snow. Though they are as red as crimson,<A name="fntext1"></a><A href="#fn1"><sup>a</sup></a> they will be as wool. <a href="http://bible.gospelcom.net/cgi-bin/bible?passage=Isa%201:18&amp;version=ESV&amp;interface=print&amp;showfn=yes&amp;showxref">Isa 1:18</a>.  
</blockquote>
<p></p>
<p><b>[3]</b>
 The 
like is said many times elsewhere. The state of souls in the next life enables anyone to know that all this is true. All people take with them from this world into the next all that composes their life, 
that is, whatever they have thought, intended, spoken, or done, also indeed whatever they have seen or heard from early childhood right through to the last phase of their life in the world; not even 
the smallest detail of any of this is lacking, <a href="2474.htm">2474</a>. Those who have led a life of faith and charity while in the world can be withheld from evils and maintained in good, and so can be raised to heaven. 
Those however who have not led a life of faith and charity while in the world but a life of self-love and love of the world sink down to hell because they cannot be withheld from evils or maintained 
in good. From all this it is evident why it is that 'driving out', when it refers to what happens to falsities and evils, means removal. In this verse and the next that removal is the subject in the 
internal sense; there the arcana of it are disclosed.

`Non expellam illum ab ante te in anno uno': quod significet non fugam seu remotionem illorum festinam, nempe falsorum et malorum, quae per gentes in terra Canaane significantur, constat ex significatione 
`expellere' quod sit fuga, qui enim in malis et falsis (o)sunt in altera vita, non expelluntur sed fugiunt a se; quod (o)etiam sit remotio, videbitur infra; et ex significatione `in anno uno' quod 
sit festinum, nam sequitur, `parum parum expellam illum ab ante te,' per quod significatur remotio per gradus secundum ordinem. 	[2] Quod `expellere' cum de malis et falsis {1} praedicatur, sit remotio, 
est quia falsa et mala ab homine non expelluntur sed removentur; qui non scit quomodo cum liberatione hominis a malis et falsis, seu cum remissione peccatorum se habet, credit {2} quod peccata 
abstergantur {3} quando dicuntur remissa; quod ita credatur, est ex sensu litterali Verbi, ubi aliquoties ita dicitur; unde perplurimorum animos insedit is error quod justi et puri sint postquam absolutionem 
receperunt; sed illi prorsus non sciunt quomodo cum remissione peccatorum se habet, quod nempe homo non purificetur ab illis sed detineatur ab illis a Domino quando talis est ut teneri possit 
in bono et vero, et quod tunc teneri possit in bono et vero quando regeneratus est, nam tunc vitam boni charitatis et veri fidei adeptus est; quicquid enim homo a prima infantia cogitat, vult, loquitur, 
et facit, addit se ejus vitae et facit illam; illa non possunt exterminari sed modo removeri, et cum removentur, tunc apparet homo sicut absque peccatis, quia remota sunt, videatur n. 8393, (a)8988 
fin., (x)9014; secundum apparentiam quod homo bonum et verum cogitet et agat ex se, cum tamen non (c)ex se sed (c)ex Domino, dictum est in Verbo quod mundus a peccatis (x)sit, et quoque {4} justus, 
{5} prout apud Esaiam, 	(o)Si fuerint peccata vestra sicut (x)coccinea, ut nix albescent; si rubra fuerint sicut purpura, ut lana erunt, i 18; </p>
<p>(o)et pluries alibi.(n) 	[3] Quod ita sit, scire datum 
est ex statu animarum in altera vita; quisque secum e mundo illuc fert omnia suae vitae, hoc est, quicquid cogitaverat, voluerat, locutus est, et fecerat, immo etiam quicquid viderat et audiverat ab 
infantia usque ad ultimum vitae suae in mundo, adeo ut ne quidem minutulum desit {6}, n. 2474; qui in mundo vitam fidei et charitatis vixerant, ii tunc detineri a malis possunt, et teneri in bono, et 
sic elevari in caelum; qui autem in mundo vitam non fidei et charitatis sed vitam amoris sui et mundi egerant, ii quia non detineri a malis et teneri in bono possunt, delabuntur in infernum.  Ex his patet 
unde est quod `expellere' cum de falsis et malis dicitur, sit remotio.  In hoc versu et in sequente agitur in sensu interno de remotione illa, et ibi arcana ejus deteguntur. @1 falsis et malis$ @2
