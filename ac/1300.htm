<h3 align="center" class="ired">属天的奥秘 第1300节</h3>
<h4 align="center"></h4><p><strong>1300.</strong>“灰泥”表良善，教会成员的心智由此形成。这也可从圣言清楚看出来，如以赛亚书：<br />耶和华啊，现在你仍是我们的父！我们是泥，你是窑匠，我们都是你手的工作。（以赛亚书<a href="http://39-27.cn/赛64.8.htm">64:8</a>，<a href="http://39-27.cn/赛64.9.htm">9</a>）<br />“泥”表正被形成的教会成员本身，因而表仁之善，人皆藉着仁之善被形成，即被改造和重生。耶利米书：<br />以色列家啊，泥在窑匠的手中怎样，你们在我的手中也怎样。（耶利米书<a href="http://39-27.cn/耶18.6.htm">18:6</a>）<br />此处“泥”也具有同样的含义。无论是说用泥建造还是说通过泥形成，意思都一样。</p>

<p><strong>[NCE]1300.</strong> The symbolism of mortar, or clay,{*1} as the goodness that forms the substance of the mind (in other words, that forms people in the church) is also evident in the Word. In Isaiah, for instance:<br />Now Jehovah, you are our Father; we are clay, and you are our potter, and we are all the work of your hand. (<a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_1300/bible_king-james-version_isaiah_64_8" target=_top>Isaiah 64:8</a>, <a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_1300/bible_king-james-version_isaiah_64_9" target=_top>9</a>)<br />Clay stands for the individual in the church who is actually being formed, and so for the charitable goodness that does all the work of shaping or forming us — that is, reforming and regenerating us. In Jeremiah:<br />Like clay in a potter's hand — that is how you are in my hand,{*2} house of Israel. (<a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_1300/bible_king-james-version_jeremiah_18_6" target=_top>Jeremiah 18:6</a>)<br />The meaning is similar. Whether the text speaks of building with clay or of forming from clay, it is the same thing.<br /><br /><strong>Footnotes:</strong><br />{*1} Mortar in the modern sense — a compound of sand, concrete, and sometimes lime — is not intended here. "Clay" in the Bible may refer to any viscous mud, not necessarily true clay. In the Middle East in biblical times, bricks were made of mud and straw and mortared together with tar (see note 3 in <a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_1300/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_1279" target=_top>1279</a>), with true clay, or with more mud. [SS]<br />{*2} The translation here assumes the reading vos in manu mea ("you are in my hand") for nos in manu tua ("we are in your hand"). This emendation matches the Hebrew (אַתֶּם‭ ‬בְּיָדִי ['attem bǝyāḏî]), as the third Latin edition (Swedenborg [1749-1756] 1949-1973) points out. [LHC] </p>
<p align="center"><b>Potts(1905-1910) 1300</b></p><p><b>1300.</b>
That "mortar" [or "clay"] signifies the good whereof the mind of the man of the church is formed, is also evident from the Word. Thus in Isaiah: </p>
<p>     Now, O Jehovah, Thou art our Father; we are the 
clay and Thou our potter, and we all are the work of Thy hand (Isa. 64:8); </p>
<p>"clay" denotes the man himself of the church who is being formed, and thus the good of charity, by means of which comes all 
the formation of man, that is, his reformation and regeneration. In Jeremiah: </p>
<p>     As the clay in the potter's hand, so are we in Thy hand, the house of Israel (Jer. 18:6); </p>
<p>the meaning being similar. 
It is all the same whether building by means of clay, or formation, is spoken of. </p>

<p align="center"><b>Elliott(1983-1999) 1300</b></p><p><b>1300.</b>
'slay' means the good from which the mind or the member of the Church is formed. This too is clear from the Word, as in Isaiah, </p>
<blockquote>
But now, O Jehovah, You are our Father, we are the clay, and You are 
our potter; and we are all the work of Your hands. <a href="http://bible.gospelcom.net/cgi-bin/bible?passage=Isa%2064:8,%209&amp;version=ESV&amp;interface=print&amp;showfn=yes&amp;showxref">Isa 64:8, 9</a>. 
</blockquote>
<p>'Clay' stands for the member himself of the Church who is being formed, and so stands for good stemming from charity by means of which 
the formation, that is, the reformation and regeneration, of every man is achieved In Jeremiah, </p>
<blockquote>
Like the clay in the hand of the potter so are you in My hand,<A name="fntext1"></a><A href="#fn1"><sup>a</sup></a> O house of Israel. <a href="http://bible.gospelcom.net/cgi-bin/bible?passage=Jer%2018:6&amp;version=ESV&amp;interface=print&amp;showfn=yes&amp;showxref">Jer 18:6</a>. 
</blockquote>
<p>Here 
too 'clay' has a similar meaning. Whether reference is made to building with clay or to forming from it, it amounts to the same.

<h4>Notes</h4><small>
<a name="fn1"></a><a href="#fntext1"><sup>a</sup></a> The Latin means so are we in Your hand, but the Hebrew means so 
are you in My hand, which Sw. has in another place where he quotes this verse. </p>

Quod 'lutum' significet bonum ex quo formatur mens seu homo Ecclesiae, constat quoque ex Verbo, ut apud Esaiam, 	Nunc Jehovah, Pater noster Tu, nos lutum, et Tu figulus noster, et opus manus Tuae omnes 
nos, lxiv 7, 8; </p>
<p>'lutum' pro ipso homine Ecclesiae qui formatur, ita pro bono charitatis per quod omnis hominis formatio, hoc est, reformatio et regeneratio: apud Jeremiam, 	Quemadmodum lutum in 
manu figuli, sic nos in manu Tua {1}, domus Israelis, xviii 6; </p>
<p>similiter: sive de aedificatione per lutum, sive de formatione, idem est. 	@1 In 6669 S. has vos in manu Mea which is as Heb.$ </p>
