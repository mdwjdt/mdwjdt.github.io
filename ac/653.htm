<h3 align="center" class="ired">属天的奥秘 第653节</h3>
<h4 align="center"></h4><p><strong>653.</strong>情况乃是这样：人在通过冲突和诱惑被改造期间，与其相联的恶灵是诸如激活他的知识和理性的那一类，而激活恶欲的恶灵则完全远离他。恶灵有两类，一类作用于人的推理，一类作用人的欲望。激活人的推理的恶灵会将他的一切虚假都提取出来，并试图使其相信它们就是真理。事实上，他们甚至会将真理转化为虚假。当处于诱惑时，人必须与这些虚假争战，尽管事实上是主藉着与他相联的天使在争战。一旦虚假通过这些冲突被分离出去，可以说被驱散后，这人就预备好接受信之真理了。只要虚假居于主导地位，人永远无法接受信之真理，因为虚假的原则挡住了路。当他被如此预备好接受信之真理时，属天的种子，也就是仁爱的种子才能第一次被植入在他里面。仁爱的种子绝不能被种植在虚假统治的土地上，而只能被种植在真理统治的土地上。这就是属灵人改造和重生的情形，被称为“挪亚”的该教会成员也是这样。正因如此，此处经文论及方舟的窗户和门，以及上中下三层，它们全都属于属灵人或觉知型的人。</p>

<p><strong>[NCE]653.</strong> Here is what happens during reformation, a process accomplished through conflict and trials. Evil spirits attach themselves to us, and they call up the facts we have heard — the ideas that seem rational to us — and nothing else. Their activity wards off any spirit who would arouse our desires.<br />There are, you see, two kinds of evil spirit: those who act on our rationalizations and those who act on our cravings. Those who stir up our rationalizations call forth all our misconceptions. They try to persuade us that falsity is truth, and more than that, they even turn our true ideas into false ones. These falsities we must combat when we are going through times of trial (although it is the Lord working through the angels connected to us who actually fights against them).<br />[2] After these battles have sifted out the falsities and apparently rid us of them, we are ready to accept the truth taught by faith. As long as falsity governs us, of course, we are completely unable to accept religious truth, because the false premises we have adopted stand in the way.<br />Once prepared in this way to accept religious truth, we can for the first time be sown with heavenly seed — the seed of charity. The seed of charity can never be sown in ground controlled by falsities, but only where truth rules.<br />That is how the reformation or rebirth of a spiritual person takes place. The same process took place among the people of the church described here, the church called Noah. That is why the current verse discusses the ark's window and door and its lowest, second-level, and third-level compartments or decks. All these things relate to our spiritual or intellectual self. </p>
<p align="center"><b>Potts(1905-1910) 653</b></p><p><b>653.</b>
The case is this: When a man is being reformed, which is effected by combats and temptations, such evil spirits are associated with him as excite nothing but his things of knowledge and reason [scientifica 
ejus et rationalia]; and spirits that excite cupidities are kept entirely away from him. For there are two kinds of evil spirits, those who act upon man's reasonings, and those who act upon his 
cupidities. The evil spirits who excite a man's reasonings bring forth all his falsities, and endeavor to persuade him that they are true, and even turn truths into falsities. A man must fight against 
these when he is in temptation; but it is really the Lord who fights, through the angels who are adjoined to the man. As soon as the falsities are separated, and as it were dispersed, by these combats, 
the man is prepared to receive the truths of faith. For so long as falsities prevail, a man never can receive the truths of faith, because the principles of falsity stand in the way. When he has thus 
been prepared to receive the truths of faith, then for the first time can celestial seeds be implanted in him, which are the seeds of charity. The seeds of charity can never be implanted in ground 
where falsities reign, but only where truths reign. Thus is it with the reformation or regeneration of the spiritual man, and so it was with the man of this church which is called "Noah." Hence it is 
that here the "window" and "door" of the ark are spoken of, and its "lowest, second, and third stories" which all pertain to the spiritual or intellectual man. </p>

<p align="center"><b>Elliott(1983-1999) 653</b></p><p><b>653.</b>
The situation is that while a person is being reformed, which takes place by means of conflicts and temptations, the evil spirits associated with him at that time are such as activate nothing else but 
his factual knowledge and his rational concepts. At that time any spirits who activate evil desires are kept entirely at bay. For there are two kinds of evil spirits, namely those who work upon man's 
reasonings and those who work upon his desires. The evil spirits who activate man's reasonings draw out all his falsities and try to persuade him that the falsities are truths. Indeed they even convert 
truths into falsities. In times of temptation a person ought to fight against them, though it is the Lord who in fact fights by means of the angels who are allied to that person. After falsities have 
been separated by means of conflicts and so to speak dispersed, the individual is then ready and able to receive truths of faith. For as long as falsities rule, a person cannot possibly receive the 
truths of faith because false assumptions are blocking the way. Once he has been made ready and able to receive the truths of faith, heavenly seeds, which are the seeds of charity, can now for the first 
time be implanted. Seeds of charity cannot possibly be implanted in ground where falsities reign, only where truths do so. This is how the reformation or regeneration of a spiritual man takes place, 
and so how it took place with the member of that Church called Noah. This is why the subject now is 'the window and the door of the ark', and the lowest, second, and third storeys, all of which belong 
to the spiritual or understanding-type man. </p>

</p><b>653.</b>
Se res ita habet: cum reformatur homo, quod fit per pugnas et tentationes, tunc tales spiritus mali ei associantur qui non nisi quam scientifica ejus et rationalia excitant, et ab illo tunc arcentur 
prorsus spiritus qui excitant cupiditates; nam bina genera spirituum malorum sunt, qui nempe in ratiocinia hominis agunt et qui in ejus cupiditates; spiritus mali qui ratiocinia hominis excitant, omnia 
falsa ejus depromunt et persuadere ei conantur quod falsa sint vera, immo etiam vera vertunt in falsa; cum quibus homo, dum in tentationibus est, pugnare debet; sed Dominus, per angelos qui homini 
adjuncti, pugnat: postquam per pugnas separata sunt, et quasi discussa falsa, tunc praeparatus est homo ut recipere possit vera fidei; quamdiu enim falsa regnant, nusquam potest homo recipere vera fidei, 
nam principia falsi obstant: cum ita praeparatus est ut recipere possit vera fidei, tunc primum inseminari possunt ei semina caelestia, quae sunt semina charitatis; semina charitatis nusquam possunt 
seminari in humo ubi falsa regnant, sed ubi vera: ita se habet reformatio seu regeneratio hominis spiritualis; ita quoque se habuit cum homine hujus Ecclesiae quae 'Noahus' vocatur. Inde est quod hic 
nunc agatur de 'fenestra et janua arcae,' deque 'mansionibus ejus infimis, secundanis et tertianis,' quae omnia ad spiritualem seu intellectualem hominem pertinent. </p>
