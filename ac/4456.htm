<h3 align="center" class="ired">属天的奥秘 第4456节</h3>
<h4 align="center"></h4><p><strong>4456.</strong>“任凭向我要多重的聘金和礼物，我必照你们向我所说的给你们”表他将接受存在于他们当中的事物，并把它们变成他自己的，也就是说，他要接受属于他们的教会外在事物，并将其连同属于他的内在事物一起变成他自己的，他们将以这种方式构成一个教会。这从“照你们向我所说的给（你们）”的含义清楚可知，“照你们向我所说的给（你们）”是指在真理与良善方面与他们合为一体，如刚才所述（<a href="4455.htm">4455</a>节）。他要他们向他增加的实际“聘金和礼物”表示同意成为一体，因为给予即将订婚的处女的聘金是双方同意的标志。他之所以要他们向他增加聘金和礼物，以至于超出律例所规定的五十锭银子，其中一个原因是：他在接受他们的宗教表象之前，就已经与她同寝，因此按照古人所知，并且在出埃及记（<a href="http://39-27.cn/出22.16.htm">22:16</a>，<a href="http://39-27.cn/出22.17.htm">17</a>）中所提到的律法，这是雅各要么同意，要么拒绝的事。但主要原因是对结合的渴望，也就是说，对“示剑”所表示的内层真理和“底拿”所表示的对外层真理的情感结合的渴望。聘金之所以是同意的标志，因而是第一个阶段的强化，是因为付银子，或给银子标志着某个事物是人自己的，因而这个处女是他的；收下银子则标志着得到回应，因而表示新娘是新郎的，新郎是新娘的。</p>

Multiply upon me exceedingly dowry and gifts and I will give as ye say unto me. That this signifies that he will accept the things that are with them, and will make them his own, that is, he would accept 
the external things of the church which belong to them and make them his own together with the internal things which belong to him, and thus they would constitute one church together, is evident 
from the signification of "giving as ye say," as being to make a one with them in respect to truth and good (see just above, n. 4455). The very dowry and gift that he said they should multiply upon him, 
signify agreement into one; for the dowry given to the virgin who was to be betrothed was a token of mutual consent. He tells them to multiply dowry and gift upon him exceedingly (thus beyond the statute, 
which was fifty pieces of silver) for the reason that he lay with her before he had accepted their religiosity, and therefore it was for Jacob to consent or refuse, according to the law known 
to the ancients and stated in Exodus 22:16; and especially because there was a desire for the conjunction of interior truth which is "Shechem," with the affection of exterior truth which is "Dinah." The 
reason why the dowry was a token of consent, and thus a confirmation of initiation, is that to pay or give silver was a sign that the thing was one's own, and thus that the virgin was his; and to accept 
it was the reciprocity, thus denoting that the bride was the bridegroom's, and the bridegroom the bride's. </p>

<p align="center"><b>Elliott(1983-1999) 4456</b></p><p><b>4456.</b>
'Increase the dowry and gift to any size, and I will give whatever you tell me' means that he will accept the things which exist with them and will make those things his own; that it is to say, he will 
accept the external things of the Church which are theirs and make those things his own together with the internal ones which are his own, and in this way they will constitute one Church. This is clear 
from the meaning of 'giving whatever you tell me' as making one with them in truth and good; dealt with immediately above in <a href="4455.htm">4455</a>. The actual 'dowry and gift' which he told them to increase to any 
size means a consenting to become one, for the dowry that was given to a virgin who was to be betrothed was a token of the consent given by both parties. One reason why he tells them to increase the 
dowry and gift to any size - and so to go above the statutory requirement, which was fifty pieces of silver - is that he lay with her before his adoption of their semblance of religion, and therefore 
it was a matter for Jacob either to consent or to refuse, in accordance with the law also known to the ancients which is set out in <a href="http://bible.gospelcom.net/cgi-bin/bible?passage=Exod%2022:16,%2017&amp;version=ESV&amp;interface=print&amp;showfn=yes&amp;showxref">Exod 22:16, 17</a>. But the chief reason why he tells them to do so was 
the desire for the joining together, that is to say, for the joining of interior truth meant by 'Shechem' to the affection for exterior truth meant by 'Dinah'. The reason why a dowry was a token of 
consent and so a strengthening of the first stage is that weighing or giving silver was a sign that a thing was one's own, and so that the virgin was his; and the acceptance of the silver was a sign of 
reciprocation. It was accordingly a sign that the bride was the bridegroom's, and the bridegroom the bride's. </p>

`Multiplicate super me valde dotem et donum, et dabo quemadmodum dicitis ad me': quod significet quod acceptabit illa quae apud illos, et faciet sua, nempe externa Ecclesiae quae illorum, cum internis 
quae sua, ac ita simul unam Ecclesiam constituent, constat ex significatione `dare quemadmodum dicitis' quod sit unum facere cum illis quoad verum et bonum, de qua mox supra n. 4455; ipsa `dos 
et donum {1}' quae dixit ut multiplicarent super illum, significat consensum in unum, nam dos quae dabatur virgini desponsandae, erat tessera quod utrinque consensus {2}; </p>
<p>dicit quod multiplicarent 
super illum valde dotem et donum, ac ita super statutum, quod erat quinquaginta argenti, ex causa quia cubuit cum illa (m)antequam acceptavit eorum religiosum, et quod esset a parte Jacobi consentire 
vel renuere, secundum legem antiquis etiam notam, de qua Exod. xxii 15, 16 [A.V. 16, 17]; </p>
<p>imprimis quia desiderata erat conjunctio, nempe interioris veri quod `Shechem,' cum affectione exterioris 
quae `Dinah.'  Quod dos fuerit tessera consensus {2} et sic confirmatio initiationis, est quia appendere seu dare argentum erat signum quod suum esset, ita quod virgo illius, et acceptare illud 
esset reciprocum, ita sponsa esset sponsi, et sponsus sponsae.      @1 domum I$      @2 confessus I$ </p>
