<h3 align="center" class="ired">属天的奥秘 第6751节</h3>
<h4 align="center"></h4><p><strong>6751.</strong>“就作了她的儿子”表这情感由此拥有最初真理，或说这时，最初真理依附于这情感。这从法老女儿的代表和“儿子”的含义清楚可知：“法老的女儿”，即此处的“她”，是指对记忆知识的一种情感（参看<a href="6750.htm">6750</a>节）；“儿子”是指真理（<a href="489.htm">489</a>，<a href="491.htm">491</a>，<a href="533.htm">533</a>，<a href="2623.htm">2623</a>，<a href="3373.htm">3373</a>节），在此是指最初真理，因为“作了她的儿子”是指拥有通过记忆知识所获得的最初真理。事实上，最初真理是从记忆知识生出的，因而就像儿子从母亲出生，母亲是对记忆知识的情感。记忆知识是构成理解力和信仰的真理的一个基础层面（参看<a href="6750.htm">6750</a>节）。当一个人正在重生时，信的事物在他里面的发展方式，几乎与他成长过程中，不属信的事物的发展方式差不多。在他成长的过程中，感官印象构成第一个层面；然后记忆知识构成另外一个层面；之后，判断力在这些层面的基础上生长，对一个人来说可能长得更充分，对另一个人来说可能长得不那么充分。人在重生期间，信仰的总体方面，或教会教义的雏形，构成第一个层面；教义和信仰的具体方面随后而来；之后连续到来的是越来越内在的事物。这些层面被天堂之光光照，理解力，以及觉知信之真理和仁之良善的能力便由此而来。</p>

<p align="center"><b>Potts(1905-1910) 6751</b></p><p><b>6751.</b>
And he was to her as a son. That this signifies that from this it had the first truths, is evident from the representation of Pharaoh's daughter, who is here meant by "her," as being the affection of 
memory-knowledges (see n. 6750); and from the signification of "son," as being truth (n. 489, 491, 533, 2623, 3373); here the first truth, for "to be to her as a son" denotes to be in the first truths 
by means of memory-knowledges; for the first truths are born from memory-knowledges, and thus are as sons from a mother, which is the affection of memory-knowledges. (That memory-knowledge is a plane 
for truths which are of understanding and of faith, see above, n. 6750.) When he is being regenerated, a man advances in the things of faith almost as he advances in the truths not of faith when he 
is growing to maturity; in this growth, sensuous things are the first plane; then memory-knowledges; and upon these planes judgment afterward grows, with one person more, with another less. During man's 
regeneration, the generals of faith, or the rudiments of the doctrine of the church, are the first plane; then the particulars of doctrine and of faith; afterward successively things more interior. 
These planes are what are enlightened by the light of heaven; hence comes the intellectual, and the power of perceiving faith and the good of charity. </p>

<p align="center"><b>Elliott(1983-1999) 6751</b></p><p><b>6751.</b>
'And he was a son to her' means that then first truths were attached to that affection. This is clear from the representation of Pharaoh's daughter, to whom 'to her' refers here, as an affection for 
factual knowledge, dealt with immediately above in <a href="6750.htm">6750</a>; and from the meaning of 'son' as truth, dealt with in <a href="489.htm">489</a>, <a href="491.htm">491</a>, <a href="533.htm">533</a>, <a href="2623.htm">2623</a>, <a href="3373.htm">3373</a>, here first truth since 'being a son to her' is possessing first 
truths acquired through factual knowledge. For first truths are born from factual knowledge and so are like sons born from their mother, who is the affection for factual knowledge. And factual knowledge 
is the groundwork for truths composing the understanding and faith, see above in <a href="6750.htm">6750</a>. When a person is being regenerated matters of faith develop in him in almost the same way as things that are 
not matters of faith develop while he is growing up. While he is growing up sensory impressions compose the first level to be laid down, then known facts another level; and after that, grounded on these 
levels, the power of judgement grows, more fully with one person, less fully with another. While a person is being regenerated the general aspects of faith or the basic elements of the Church's teachings 
compose the level that is laid down first, then come particular aspects of that teaching and faith, and after that in successive stages things that are more and more internal. These are levels 
which the light of heaven shines on; and from this comes the power of understanding, and the ability to perceive the truth of faith and the good of charity. </p>

`Et fuit ei in filium': quod significet quod inde ei vera prima, constat ex repraesentatione `filiae Pharaonis,' quae hic est `ei,' quod sit affectio scientificorum, de qua mox supra n. 6750; et ex 
significatione `filii' quod sit verum, de qua n. 489, 491, 533, 2623, 3373, hic verum primum, (m){1}nam `esse ei in filium' est esse in primis veris per scientifica, prima enim vera nascuntur ex scientificis, 
ac ita sunt sicut filii (c)a matre, quae est affectio scientificorum;(n) quod scientificum sit planum veris quae intellectus et fidei, videatur supra n. 6750.  Procedit homo in rebus fidei cum 
regeneratur, paene sicut procedit in {2}rebus non fidei cum adolescit; cum adolescit, tunc sensualia sunt primum planum, dein scientifica, et super his planis postea crescit judicium, apud unum plus, 
apud alterum minus; cum regeneratur homo, tunc communia fidei seu rudimenta doctrinae Ecclesiae sunt primum planum, dein sunt particularia doctrinae {3}et fidei, postea successive magis interiora; haec
