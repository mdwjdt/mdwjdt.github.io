<h3 align="center" class="ired">属天的奥秘 第2242节</h3>
<h4 align="center"></h4><p><strong>2242.</strong>“我现在要下去察看”表造访。这从“下去察看”的含义清楚可知，“下去察看”是指审判（如第一卷所解释的，<a href="1311.htm">1311</a>节），因而是指造访。在圣言中，总体上教会的末期和具体的个人的末期被称为造访。它发生在审判之前，所以造访无非是指探查性质，即探查总体上教会的性质或具体的个人的性质。这种探查在字义上被表述为耶和华“下去察看”。<br />由此清楚可知字义的性质，因为耶和华不会下去（即降临），下去（即降临）不能用来论及主，因为主一直居于至高处。耶和华也不会察看事情是否如此，因为祂自永恒就知道一切，无论总体还是细节。然而，经上之所以表述为耶和华下来察看，是因为在人看来，事情似乎是这样。人居于在下之物，无论下面出现任何事物，他都想不到或不知道在上之物是何情形，因而不知道它们是如何流入的，其思维只能延伸到离他最近的事物。因此，他只能觉察到诸如主下来察看之类的事，并且这种觉察更为有限，因为他以为没人知道他在想什么。此外，除了以为神真从高处下来外，他想不到别的。而事实上，神并非从至高处而来，而是从至内在而来。<br />谁都能由此清楚明白字义的性质，也就是说，它照表象形成，否则，没人读懂并承认圣言，因而也不会接受它。但天使不像世人那样受表象限制，因此圣言的字义适合世人，圣言的内义适合天使，以及那些蒙主怜悯活在世上就被允许如同天使之人。<br />造访（在圣经中经常译为降罚、惩罚、刑罚、追讨等）在圣言各处有所提及，在那里它要么表示教会或个人的荒废，要么表示眷顾，因而表示探查人或物的性质。在以赛亚书，它表示荒废：<br />到降罚的日子，有灾祸从远方临到。你们向谁逃奔求救呢？你们的荣耀存留何处呢？（以赛亚书<a href="http://39-27.cn/赛10.3.htm">10:3</a>）<br /><br />天上的众星群宿都不发光，日头一出，就变黑暗；月亮也不放光。我必因邪恶刑罚世界，因罪孽刑罚恶人。（以赛亚书<a href="http://39-27.cn/赛13.10.htm">13:10</a>，<a href="http://39-27.cn/赛13.11.htm">11</a>）<br />不发光的众星群宿、变黑暗的日头和不放光的月亮表示爱与仁将不复存在（参看<a href="2120.htm">2120</a>节）。由于这是荒废，故它是“降罚的日子”。<br />耶利米书：<br />他们必在仆倒的人中仆倒；到惩罚他们的时候，他们必致跌倒。（耶利米书<a href="http://39-27.cn/耶8.12.htm">8:12</a>）<br />这表示当他们被荒废的时候，或当仁与信不复存在的时候。以西结书：<br />惩罚这城的近前来，各人手里拿着毁灭的工具。（以西结书<a href="http://39-27.cn/结9.1.htm">9:1</a>）<br />这也论及荒废，所以“各人手里拿着毁灭的工具”。何西阿书：<br />降罚的日子临近，报应的日子来到。（何西阿书<a href="http://39-27.cn/何9.7.htm">9:7</a>）<br />此处的意思也一样。弥迦书：<br />你守望的日子，降罚已经来到，他们必扰乱不安。（弥迦书<a href="http://39-27.cn/弥7.4.htm">7:4</a>）<br />此处降罚也表示已荒废的仁爱。摩西五经：<br />只是到我追讨的日子，我必追讨他们的罪。（出埃及记<a href="http://39-27.cn/出32.34.htm">32:34</a>）<br />这论及在旷野中的百姓，当时他们已经为自己造了金牛犊。“造访”表示眷顾，这一点从很多经文明显看出来（如出埃及记<a href="http://39-27.cn/出3.16.htm">3:16</a>；<a href="http://39-27.cn/出4.31.htm">4:31</a>；耶利米书<a href="http://39-27.cn/耶27.22.htm">27:22</a>；<a href="http://39-27.cn/耶29.10.htm">29:10</a>；路加福音<a href="http://39-27.cn/路1.68.htm">1:68</a>，<a href="http://39-27.cn/路1.78.htm">78</a>；<a href="http://39-27.cn/路19.41.htm">19:41</a>-<a href="http://39-27.cn/路19.42.htm">42</a>）。</p>

<p align="center"><b>Potts(1905-1910) 2242</b></p><p><b>2242.</b>
I will go down, I pray, and I will see. That this signifies visitation, is evident from the signification of "going down to see," as being Judgment (explained in volume 1, n. 1311), consequently that 
it is visitation. The last time of the church in general, and that of everyone in particular, is called in the Word "visitation," which precedes Judgment; thus a "visitation" is simply an exploration 
as to quality, that is, as to the quality of the church in general, or of a man in particular; and this exploration is expressed in the sense of the letter by Jehovah "going down and seeing."  [2] This 
shows what is the nature of the sense of the letter, for Jehovah does not go down, since going down cannot be predicated of the Lord, because He is always in the highest; nor does Jehovah see whether 
a thing be so, for seeing whether it be so cannot be predicated of the Lord, because He knows all things from eternity both in general and in particular. Nevertheless it is so expressed because it 
appears to man as if it were so, for man is in things that are below, and when anything appears there, he does not think or even know how the case is with things that are above, thus neither how they 
flow in, for his thought goes no further than to what is nearest to him, and hence he cannot perceive otherwise than that there is some such thing as going down and seeing, and this the more because 
he imagines that no one knows what he is thinking; besides that he has no other idea than that there is a coming down from on high, and, when said of God, from the highest; whereas it is not from the 
highest, but from the inmost.  [3] This shows what is the nature of the sense of the letter, namely, that it is according to appearances and if it were not according to appearances, no one would understand 
and acknowledge the Word; thus no one would receive it. But the angels are not in appearances in the way that man is, and therefore while the Word as to the sense of the letter is for man, as to 
the internal sense it is for the angels, as also for those men to whom of the Lord's Divine mercy it is given, while living in the world, to be like the angels.  [4] "Visitation" is mentioned in various 
places in the Word, and by it is signified either vastation-whether of the church or of each man-or deliverance, and thus exploration as to quality. It denotes vastation in Isaiah: </p>
<p>     What will 
ye do in the day of visitation? it shall come from far. To whom will ye flee for help? and where will ye leave your glory? (Isa. 10:3). And again: </p>
<p>     The stars of the heavens and the constellations 
thereof shall not shine with their light, the sun shall be darkened in his going forth, and the moon shall not cause her light to shine, and I will visit evil upon the world, and upon the wicked 
their iniquity (Isa. 13:10, 11). That by the stars and constellations which shall not shine, and the sun which shall be darkened, and the moon which shall not make her light to shine, is signified that 
there will be no love and no charity, may be seen above (n. 2120); and as this is vastation, it is the "day of visitation."  [5] In Jeremiah: </p>
<p>     They shall fall among them that fall, and in the 
time of their visitation they shall stumble (Jer. 8:12); </p>
<p>meaning the time when they have been vastated, or when there is no charity and faith. In Ezekiel: </p>
<p>     The visitations of the city have come 
near, and every man with his instrument of destruction in his hand (Ezek. 9:1). Here also vastation is treated of; hence every man has an instrument of destruction. In Hosea: </p>
<p>     The days of visitation 
are come, the days of retribution are come (Hos. 9:7). In Micah: </p>
<p>     The day of thy watchmen, thy visitation, is come; now shall be their perplexity (Micah 7:4), also denoting vastated charity. 
In Moses: </p>
<p>     In the day of My visiting, and I will visit upon them their sin (Exod. 32:34), where the people in the wilderness are treated of, after they had made for themselves the golden calf. 
That deliverance is signified by "visitation" is plain from many passages (as Exod. 3:16; 4:31; Jer. 27:22; 29:10; Luke 1:68, 78; 19:41-42). </p>

<p align="center"><b>Elliott(1983-1999) 2242</b></p><p><b>2242.</b>
That 'I will go down now, and I will see' means visitation becomes clear from the meaning of 'going down to see' as judgement, dealt with in Volume One, in <a href="1311.htm">1311</a>, and consequently as visitation. The final 
period of the Church in general and of the individual in particular is called visitation in the Word. It occurs prior to judgement, so that visitation is nothing else than an investigation into what 
such are like, that is, into the nature of the Church in general or of the individual in particular. Such investigation is expressed in the sense of the letter as Jehovah coming down and seeing. </p>
<p></p>
<p><b>[2]</b>
From this the nature of the sense of the letter is made clear, for Jehovah does not go down; indeed one cannot speak of the Lord going down because He always dwells in highest things. Nor does Jehovah 
look and see whether a thing is so; for one cannot speak of the Lord looking to see whether a thing is so because every single thing is known to Him from eternity. Yet the sense of the letter speaks 
of Jehovah going down to see because to man that is what He does appear to do. For man dwells among lowest things and when anything presents itself there he does not think about, nor does he even 
know, what the situation is with higher things and so does not know about how these flow in. He has no knowledge of these things because his thought does not extend beyond what is immediately about 
him, and therefore he cannot perceive what the Lord does as anything other than some such going down to see; and that perception is even more limited when he imagines that no one knows what he himself 
is thinking. Besides this, he has no other idea than that an actual coming down from on high is meant, and when said of God, from the highest. But it is not in fact a coming down from the highest but 
from the inmost. </p>
<p></p>
<p><b>[3]</b>
 From this one may see what the sense of the letter is like, namely that it is shaped according to appearances, and that if it were not, nobody would understand and acknowledge 
the Word, nor thus accept it. But angels are not limited by appearances in the way that man is, and therefore since the Word as to the letter is for man, it is as to the internal sense for angels, and 
also for those men who in the Lord's Divine mercy have been allowed during their lifetime in the world to be as the angels.  </p>
<p></p>
<p><b>[4]</b>
 Visitation is mentioned in various places in the Word, where it either 
means the vastation of the Church or of the individual, or else deliverance, and thus the investigation into the nature of persons or things. It stands for vastation in Isaiah, </p>
<blockquote>
What will you do 
on the day of visitation? It will come from afar. To whom will you flee for help, and where will you leave your glory? <a href="http://bible.gospelcom.net/cgi-bin/bible?passage=Isa%2010:%203&amp;version=ESV&amp;interface=print&amp;showfn=yes&amp;showxref">Isa 10: 3</a>. 
</blockquote>
<p>In the same prophet, </p>
<blockquote>
The stars of the heavens and their constellations 
will not give their light. The sun will be darkened in its going out, and the moon will not shed its light. And I will visit the world for evil, and the wicked for their iniquity. <a href="http://bible.gospelcom.net/cgi-bin/bible?passage=Isa%2013:%2010,%2011&amp;version=ESV&amp;interface=print&amp;showfn=yes&amp;showxref">Isa 13: 10, 11</a>. 
</blockquote>
<p>'The stars and the constellations which will not give their light, and the sun which will be darkened, and the moon which will not shed its light' means that no love and no charity will exist, 
see <a href="2120.htm">2120</a>. And since this is vastation it is 'the day of visitation'. </p>
<p></p>
<p><b>[5]</b>
 In Jeremiah, </p>
<blockquote>
They will fall among those who fall, and in the time of their visitation they will stumble. <a href="http://bible.gospelcom.net/cgi-bin/bible?passage=Jer%208:%2012&amp;version=ESV&amp;interface=print&amp;showfn=yes&amp;showxref">Jer 8: 12</a>. 
</blockquote>
<p>This 
stands for the time when they have been vastated, that is, when no charity and faith exist. In Ezekiel, </p>
<blockquote>
The visitations of the city have drawn near, and each man has his weapon of destruction 
in his hand. <a href="http://bible.gospelcom.net/cgi-bin/bible?passage=Ezek%209:%201&amp;version=ESV&amp;interface=print&amp;showfn=yes&amp;showxref">Ezek 9: 1</a>. 
</blockquote>
<p>This too is a reference to vastation; consequently 'each man has a weapon of destruction'. In Hosea, </p>
<blockquote>
The days of visitation have come, the days of recompense have come. 
<a href="http://bible.gospelcom.net/cgi-bin/bible?passage=Hosea%209:%207&amp;version=ESV&amp;interface=print&amp;showfn=yes&amp;showxref">Hosea 9: 7</a>. 
</blockquote>
<p>Here the meaning is similar. In Micah, </p>
<blockquote>
The day of your watchmen, your visitation, has come; now will be their confusion. <a href="http://bible.gospelcom.net/cgi-bin/bible?passage=Micah%207:-4&amp;version=ESV&amp;interface=print&amp;showfn=yes&amp;showxref">Micah 7:-4</a>. 
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
Here also it stands for charity that has been 
laid waste. In Moses, On the day of My visiting, I will visit them with their sin. <a href="http://bible.gospelcom.net/cgi-bin/bible?passage=Exod%2032:%2034&amp;version=ESV&amp;interface=print&amp;showfn=yes&amp;showxref">Exod 32: 34</a>. 
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
This refers to the people in the wilderness after they had made themselves the golden calf. That visitation 
also means deliverance is evident from the following places, <a href="http://bible.gospelcom.net/cgi-bin/bible?passage=Exod%203:%2016;%204:%2031&amp;version=ESV&amp;interface=print&amp;showfn=yes&amp;showxref">Exod 3: 16; 4: 31</a>; <a href="http://bible.gospelcom.net/cgi-bin/bible?passage=Jer%2027:%2022;%2029:%2010&amp;version=ESV&amp;interface=print&amp;showfn=yes&amp;showxref">Jer 27: 22; 29: 10</a>; <a href="http://bible.gospelcom.net/cgi-bin/bible?passage=Luke%201:-68,%2078;%2019:%2041,%2042&amp;version=ESV&amp;interface=print&amp;showfn=yes&amp;showxref">Luke 1:-68, 78; 19: 41, 42</a>.

`Descendam quaeso, et videbo': quod significet visitationem, constare potest ex significatione `descendere ad videndum' quod sit judicium, de qua in Parte Prima n. 1311, proinde quod sit visitatio; 
ultimum tempus Ecclesiae in communi, et ultimum tempus cujusvis in particulari, in Verbo vocatur visitatio, ac praecedit judicium, estque sic visitatio non aliud quam exploratio qualis est, nempe qualis 
Ecclesia {1} in communi, vel homo in particulari, quae exploratio exprimitur in sensu litterae per quod `descendat Jehovah et videat'; [2] sensus litterae qualis sit, inde constare potest, non enim 
descendit Jehovah, nam de Domino non praedicari potest descendere quia semper in supremis est; nec videt Jehovah num ita sit, nam nec de Domino praedicari potest videre num ita sit quia omnia et singula 
ab aeterno novit; sed usque ita dicitur quia apud hominem apparet sicut ita fieret; homo enim est in inferioribus, et cum ibi aliquid existit, non cogitat, ne quidem scit, quomodo se superiora habent, 
ita nec quomodo influunt, non (t)enim ultra quam ad proxima cogitatio {2} ejus vadit, inde non potest aliter percipere quam quod sit aliquid tale quod simile est descendere et videre; et eo magis 
cum putat quod nemo sciat quod cogitat; praeter quod non aliam ideam habeat {3} quam quod sit ab alto, et cum a Deo quod sit ab altissimo, cum tamen non ab altissimo, sed ab intimo; [3] inde constare 
potest qualis sit qualis litterae, quod nempe sit secundum apparentias, qui si non foret secundum apparentias, Verbum nemo intelligeret et agnosceret, ita non {4} reciperet; sed angeli non ita in apparentiis 
sunt sicut homo, quare Verbum cum quoad litteram est pro homine, quoad sensum internum est pro angelis, tum etiam pro illis hominibus quibus, ex Divina Domini Misericordia, donatum est, cum {5} 
vivunt in mundo, esse sicut angeli.  [4] (s)Visitatio passim memoratur in Verbo, et per (c)eam significatur vel vastatio quae est Ecclesiae aut cujusvis, vel liberatio, ita exploratio qualis est; pro 
vastatione, apud Esaiam, 	Quid facietis die visitationis {6}?... E longinquo veniet, ad quem fugietis pro auxilio, et ubi relinquetis gloriam vestram? x 3: </p>
<p>apud eundem, 	Stellae caelorum et sidera 
eorum non lucebunt luce sua, obtenebrabitur sol in egressu suo, et luna non splendere faciet lucem suam, et visitabo super orbem malum,' et super impios iniquitatem eorum, xiii 10, 11; </p>
<p>	 quod per 
`stellas et sidera quae non lucebunt, et solem qui obscurabitur, et lunam quae non splendere faciet lucem suam' significetur quod nullus amor {7} et nulla charitas, videatur n. 2120, et quia id est vastatio, 
est `dies visitationis': [5] apud Jeremiam, 	Cadent inter cadentes, et tempore visitationis eorum 	impingent, viii 12; </p>
<p>pro tempore cum vastati sunt, seu cum nulla charitas et fides: apud Ezechielem, 	Appropinquarunt 
visitationes urbis, et vir instrumentum perditionis ejus in manu ejus, ix 1; </p>
<p>ibi etiam {8} de vastatione agitur, inde `instrumentum perditionis viro': apud Hosheam, 	Venerunt 
dies visitationis, venerunt dies retributionis, ix 7; </p>
<p>similiter: apud Micham,       Dies speculatorum tuorum, visitatio tua venit, nunc erit perplexitas eorum, vii 4; </p>
<p>etiam pro vastata charitate: 
apud Mosen,       In die visitandi Me {9}, et visitabo super eos peccatum eorum, Exod. xxxii 34; </p>

liberatio, patet {10} a sequentibus locis,' Exod. iii 16; iv 31; Jer. xxvii 22; xxix 10; Luc. i 68, 78; xix 41, 42.(s) 	@1 i vel.$ 	@2 i quae percipit.$ 	@3 possit habere.$ 	@4 nec.$ 	@5 dum.$ 	@6
