<h3 align="center" class="ired">属天的奥秘 第7441节</h3>
<h4 align="center"></h4><p><strong>7441.</strong>“看哪，我必打发讨厌的苍蝇到你和你臣仆并你百姓的身上，进你的各家”表恶毒的虚假就会存在于每一个方面。这从“法老和他的臣仆并他百姓”，以及“讨厌的苍蝇”的含义清楚可知：“法老和他的臣仆并他百姓”是指属世心智的每一个部分（参看<a href="7396.htm">7396</a>节），当经上补充说“进你的各家”时，也表示进入该心智的内层部分，如前所述（<a href="7407.htm">7407</a>节）；“讨厌的苍蝇”是指由前面的神迹所表示的邪恶产生的虚假，因而是指恶毒的虚假。至于此处“讨厌的苍蝇”表示哪些虚假，它们属于哪种类型，这从这些虚假所源于的邪恶清楚可知。这些邪恶就是存在于属世心智最外层，因而存在于感官层的邪恶（参看<a href="7419.htm">7419</a>节）。源于这些邪恶的虚假也属于这一类。<br />在以赛亚书，“埃及的苍蝇”所表示这些虚假。<br />当那日，耶和华要发嘶声，使埃及河尽头的苍蝇和亚述地的蜂子飞来；它们必都飞来，落在荒凉的河内、磐石的穴里。（以赛亚书<a href="http://39-27.cn/赛7.18.htm">7:18</a>-<a href="http://39-27.cn/赛7.19.htm">19</a>）<br />此处“埃及河尽头的苍蝇”是指在属世心智最外在的部分中，因而在最接近身体的感官层的虚假。这些虚假好比这种昆虫，因为在心智这个部分中的事物就像飞在空中的昆虫，使内层事物变得模糊，还对它们造成伤害。因为那里的事物大部分是凭空想象出来的，是产生推理的幻觉，这些推理就像空中的楼阁。这种“讨厌的苍蝇”只在诗篇再次出现过（诗篇<a href="http://39-27.cn/诗78.45.htm">78:45</a>；<a href="http://39-27.cn/诗105.31.htm">105:31</a>），那里也论及埃及。要知道，圣言中所提到的一切飞行生物都表示与理解力有关的事物，因而表示真理，在反面意义上表示虚假（<a href="40.htm">40</a>，<a href="745.htm">745</a>，<a href="776.htm">776</a>，<a href="778.htm">778</a>，<a href="866.htm">866</a>，<a href="988.htm">988</a>，<a href="3219.htm">3219</a>，<a href="5149.htm">5149</a>节）。但最低级的那类飞行生物，也就是昆虫，表示真理，在反面意义上表示虚假，它们越属于感官层，就越低级和模糊。事实上，这些事物若不从更内层的事物那里接受光明，就完全笼罩在模糊和幽暗之中；因为它们离身体最近，因而接近尘世事物；这些尘世事物形成天堂事物立于其上的根基，并沉浸在幽暗之中。</p>

Behold I send against thee, and against thy servants, and against thy people, and into thy houses, the noisome fly. That this signifies that they would have the falsity of malevolence in all things and 
in each, is evident from the signification of "Pharaoh, his servants, and his people," as being all things and each that belong to the natural mind (see n. 7396), and as "into thy houses" is added, 
there is also signified into the interiors of this mind (as above, n. 7407); and from the signification of "the noisome fly," as being the falsities of that evil which was signified by the portent which 
precedes, thus the falsities of malevolence. What falsities, therefore, and of what kind, are here signified by "the noisome fly," is clear from the evils from which these falsities come. That these 
evils were the evils that are in the outermost parts of the natural mind, thus that are in the sensuous, see above, n. 7419; and the falsities that are from these evils are of the same kind, and are 
the falsities which are signified also by the "flies of Egypt" in Isaiah: </p>
<p>     It shall come to pass in that day, that Jehovah shall hiss for the fly that is in the uttermost part of the rivers of 
Egypt, and for the bee that is in the land of Asshur; and they shall come, and shall rest all of them in the rivers of desolations and in the clefts of the rocks (Isa. 7:18-19); </p>
<p>here "the fly in the 
uttermost part of the rivers of Egypt" denotes the falsities that are in the outermost parts of the natural mind, thus that are in the sensuous nearest the body. These falsities are compared to such an 
insect, because the things in this part of the mind are like insects flying in the air, obscuring interior things and also inflicting injury on them; for they are mostly imaginary, and are fallacies, 
the reasonings from which are like castles in the air. The "noisome fly" of this kind is mentioned only in David (Ps. 78:45, and 105:31), where Egypt is also spoken of. Be it known that all the flying 
things mentioned in the Word signify things of the intellect, and consequently truths, and in the opposite sense falsities (n. 40, 745, 776, 778, 866, 988, 3219, 5149); but flying things of the lowest 
sort, which are insects, signify truths, and in the opposite sense falsities, which are more ignoble and obscure in proportion as they belong to the sensuous, for unless these things are enlightened 
by things more interior they are in total obscurity and darkness, being next the body, and consequently near to earthly things, where heavenly things terminate, and are immersed in thick darkness. </p>

<p align="center"><b>Elliott(1983-1999) 7441</b></p><p><b>7441.</b>
'behold, I send onto you, and onto your servants, and onto your people, and into your houses, noxious flying insects' means that malevolent falsity will be present in every single aspect. This is clear 
from the meaning of 'Pharaoh, his servants, and his people' as every single part of the natural mind, dealt with in <a href="7396.htm">7396</a>, and when 'into the houses' is added, an entry into the interior parts of that 
mind as well is meant, as above in <a href="7407.htm">7407</a>; and from the meaning of 'noxious flying insects' as falsities arising out of the evil that was meant by the previous wonder, thus malevolent falsities. Exactly 
which falsities therefore are meant here by 'noxious flying insects', and what type they belong to, is evident from the evils they spring from. And those evils were evils that exist on the outermost 
levels of the natural mind, thus on those of the senses, see above in <a href="7419.htm">7419</a>. The falsities which spring from them belong to the same sort.  </p>
<p></p>
<p><b>[2]</b>
 The same falsities are what are also meant by 'the 
flies of Egypt' in Isaiah, </p>
<blockquote>
It will happen on that day, that Jehovah will whistle for the fly that is in the furthest part of the rivers of Egypt, and for the bee that is in the land of Asshur. They 
will come and all of them will rest in rivers of desolations, and in the clefts of rocks. <a href="http://bible.gospelcom.net/cgi-bin/bible?passage=Isa%207:18,%2019&amp;version=ESV&amp;interface=print&amp;showfn=yes&amp;showxref">Isa 7:18, 19</a>. 
</blockquote>
<p>'The fly in the farthest part of the rivers of Egypt' is falsities which reside in the outermost 
parts of the natural mind, thus on the level of the senses nearest to the body. These falsities are compared to an insect like that sort of insect because on that level they are exactly like insects 
that fly in the air, obscure the things on more internal levels, and inflict harm on them. For the things which are there are for the most part figments of the imagination; they are illusions giving 
rise to reasonings that are like buildings founded on nothing but air. Mention of this kind of noxious flying insect occurs again only in David, in <a href="http://bible.gospelcom.net/cgi-bin/bible?passage=Ps%2078:45&amp;version=ESV&amp;interface=print&amp;showfn=yes&amp;showxref">Ps 78:45</a> and <a href="http://bible.gospelcom.net/cgi-bin/bible?passage=Ps%20105:31&amp;version=ESV&amp;interface=print&amp;showfn=yes&amp;showxref">Ps 105:31</a>, where also the reference 
is to Egypt. It should be recognized that flying creatures in the Word all mean things that are connected with the understanding, consequently truths or in the contrary sense falsities, <a href="40.htm">40</a>, <a href="745.htm">745</a>, <a href="776.htm">776</a>, <a href="778.htm">778</a>, <a href="866.htm">866</a>, <a href="988.htm">988</a>, <a href="3219.htm">3219</a>, <a href="5149.htm">5149</a>. But the lowest sort of flying creatures, which are insects, mean truths, or in the contrary sense falsities, which are quite low-grade and obscure, as those are which belong 
properly to the level of the senses. For unless they receive light from the more internal levels, gloom and darkness completely envelop them; for they are nearest to the body and therefore close to 
earthly things that form the base on which heavenly things rest, and are immersed in thick darkness. </p>

`Ecce Ego immitto in te, et in servos tuos, et in populum tuum, et in domos tuas, volatile noxium': quod significet quod illis falsum malevolentiae in omnibus et singulis, constat ex significatione 
`Pharaonis, servorum ejus, et populi ejus' quod sint omnia et singula quae mentis naturalis, de qua n. 7396, cum etiam adjicitur `in domos,' significatur quod etiam in interiora {1}illius mentis, ut supra 
n. 7407; et ex significatione `volatilis noxii' quod sint falsa illius mali, {2}quod per prodigium quod praecedit significatum est, ita falsa malevolentiae; quaenam itaque et cujus generis falsa 
hic per `volatile noxium' significantur, {3}liquet a malis a quibus sunt; quod mala illa fuerint mala quae in {4} externis {5}mentis naturalis, ita quae in sensuali, videatur supra n. 7419; falsa {6}quae 
inde ejusdem generis sunt; haec falsa 2 sunt quae quoque significantur per `muscas Aegypti' apud Esaiam, Fiet in die illo, sibilabit Jehovah muscae quae in extremitate fluviorum Aegypti, et api quae 
in terra Aschuris; quae venient, et quiescent omnes in fluviis desolationum, et in fissuris petrarum, vii 18, 19; </p>
<p>`musca in extremitate fluviorum Aegypti' sunt falsa quae in externis mentis naturalis, 
ita quae in sensuali corpori proximo; haec comparantur insecto tali quia illa quae ibi non {7}aliter se habent (x)quam sicut insecta {8}volantia in aere, et obscurantia interiora, et quoque damnum 
illis inferentia; sunt enim quae ibi quoad plurimam partem imaginaria, et sunt fallaciae ex quibus ratiocinia sunt sicut talia quae fundantur in aere.  {9}Volatile noxium hujus generis memoratur solum 
apud Davidem, Ps. lxxviii 45 et Ps. cv 31, ubi quoque de Aegypto. Sciendum quod `volatilia' in Verbo omnia significent intellectualia, (c)ac inde vera, (c)et in opposito sensu falsa, n. 40, 745, 776, 
778, 866, 988, 3219, 5149; sed volatilia infimae sortis, quae sunt insecta, significant vera, et in opposito sensu falsa, quae ignobiliora et obscuriora sunt, prout sunt illa quae propria sensualis 
sunt; nam illa nisi illustrentur ab interioribus, sunt prorsus in obscuro et tenebroso, sunt enim proxima corpori, et inde prope ad terrestria ubi caelestia terminantur, et immerguntur {10}caligini. 	@1
