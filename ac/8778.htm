<h3 align="center" class="ired">属天的奥秘 第8778节</h3>
<h4 align="center"></h4><p><strong>8778.</strong>“摩西就将百姓的话回禀耶和华”表对应和结合。这从“将话回禀耶和华”的含义清楚可知，“将话回禀耶和华”是指对应和随之的结合。因为所论述的主题是要与百姓所立的约，由于立约要经双方同意，所以某种类似立约的事在此发生。也就是说，耶和华提议，百姓回应，在此通过摩西回应，摩西代表与存在于天堂中的神性真理联结的从神来的真理（参看<a href="8760.htm">8760</a>节），这真理是居间的。但与人类立约只能通过接受来自神性的真理的流注，然后通过那时的对应实现；因为当高层事物流入低层事物时，它们不能以其它任何方式被接受。<br />至于何为对应和经由对应而来的接受，这从前面许多章节末尾关于存在于人里面的一切事物与存在于天堂里面的一切事物的对应关系的说明可以看出来。在那些章节还说明，属世事物与属灵事物，以及总体上低层事物与高层事物的一切结合都通过这种对应关系实现。因为这种对应关系是不存在的，除非低层事物从属并服从于高层事物；当低层事物服从时，高层事物就作用于低层事物，就像一个原因作用它的结果一样。由此可以看出当神性流入时，人这一方的回应是什么情况；也可以看出此处字义上通过立约的方式所描述的结合是怎么回事；即耶和华通过一个使者或中间人对百姓说话，这个使者或中间人把他们的答复回禀耶和华。因为人能以这种方式理解与神性结合的概念。</p>

And Moses reported the words of the people unto Jehovah. That this signifies correspondence and conjunction, is evident from the signification of "reporting the words unto Jehovah," as being correspondence 
and the consequent conjunction; for the subject treated of is the covenant which was to be made with the people, and because covenants are made by consent on both sides, therefore something resembling 
this is done here, namely, Jehovah proposes, and the people answer, here through Moses, by whom is represented truth from the Divine conjoined with truth Divine in heaven (see n. 8760), which 
is mediating. But the covenant is not made with man otherwise than through the reception of the influx of truth from the Divine, and then through correspondence; for when higher things flow in into lower, 
they are not received in any other way. [2] What correspondence is and reception thereby, can be seen from what has been shown at the end of many chapters concerning the correspondence of all things 
in man with those things which are in heaven, and also that all conjunction of natural things with spiritual, and in general of lower things with higher, is effected through this correspondence; 
for there is no correspondence unless lower things are made subject to higher ones through subordination; and when they have been made subject, the higher things act in the lower exactly as a cause acts 
in its effect. From all this it can be seen how the case is with the reciprocity of man when the Divine flows in; and in regard to the conjunction which is here described in the sense of the letter 
by the manner in which covenants are made; namely, that Jehovah speaks by a go-between to the people, and the go-between reports the answer unto Jehovah; for in this way conjunction with the Divine can 
be apprehended by man. </p>

'And Moses brought back the people's words to Jehovah' means correspondence and being joined together. This is clear from the meaning of 'bringing words back to Jehovah' as correspondence and consequently 
being joined together. For the subject is the covenant that is to be made with the people; and since covenants are made through agreement on both sides, something that resembles the making of a 
covenant takes place here. That is to say, Jehovah proposes and the people respond, at this point through Moses, who represents the truth from God when it has been joined to Divine Truth as it exists 
in heaven, <a href="8760.htm">8760</a>, which is intermediary. But the only way that the covenant is made with mankind is through being receptive of the influx of truth from the Divine, and through correspondence at that time; 
for when higher things flow into lower they are not received in any other way. </p>
<p></p>
<p><b>[2]</b>
 What correspondence and receptivity through correspondence are becomes clear from what has been shown at the ends 
of quite a number of chapters regarding the correspondence of all things present in the human being with the things that exist in heaven. It has also been shown in those places that all joining of 
natural things to spiritual ones, and in general of lower things to higher ones, is accomplished through correspondence. Such correspondence does not exist unless the lower things are placed in subordinate 
positions and made subject to the higher ones; and when the lower have been made subject, the higher ones act on them altogether as a cause does on its effect. From all this one may see what reciprocity 
on man's side is when the Divine flows in, and what the consequent joining together is, which is described in the sense of the letter here by the method used to make covenants, which is that 
Jehovah speaks to the people through a messenger, and the messenger brings their reply back to Jehovah. For this is how a person can grasp the concept of being joined to the Divine. </p>

`Et retulit Moscheh verba populi ad Jehovam': quod significet correspondentiam et conjunctionem, constat ex significatione `referre verba ad Jehovam quod sit correspondentia et inde conjunctio; agitur 
enim de foedere quod pangendum est cum populo; et quia foedera panguntur per consensum utrinque, ideo ad instar ejus fit hic, quod nempe Jehovah proponat et populus respondeat, hic per `Moschen,' per 
quem repraesentatur verum a Divino conjunctum {1}Divino Vero in caelo, n. 8760, quod medians est; sed {2} non pangitur foedus cum homine aliter quam per receptionem influxus veri a Divino, et tunc 
per correspondentiam, superiora enim cum influunt in inferiora, 2 non aliter (x)recipiuntur; quid correspondentia et receptio per illam, constare potest ex illis quae ad finem plurium capitum de correspondentia 
omnium quae {3}apud hominem cum illis quae in caelo ostensa sunt; et quoque ibi quod omnis conjunctio naturalium cum spiritualibus, et in genere inferiorum cum superioribus per illam fiat; 
correspondentia enim non datur nisi inferiora per subordinationem subjecta sunt superioribus, et cum subjecta sunt, {4}agunt superiora in inferioribus prorsus sicut causa in suo effectu; ex his constare 
potest quomodo se habet cum reciproco hominis cum influit Divinum, et de conjunctione {5}, quae hic in sensu litterae describitur per modum per quem panguntur foedera, quod nempe Jehovah loquatur per 
internuntium ad populum, et internuntius referat responsum ad Jehovam; nam ita conjunctio cum Divino capi potest ab homine. 	@1 Vero Divino IT$ 	@2 i in se$ 	@3 in homine$ 	@4 tunc conjunctio erit
