<h3 align="center" class="ired">属天的奥秘 第2805节</h3>
<h4 align="center"></h4><p><strong>2805.</strong>“但燔祭的羊羔在哪里呢”表那些要成圣的人类成员在哪呢？这从祭物，尤其燔祭的代表物清楚可知。燔祭和祭物是内在敬拜的代表物（参看<a href="922.htm">922</a>，<a href="923.htm">923</a>节）；它们由牛羊制成；当用羊来献祭时，就用羊羔、绵羊、母山羊、小绵羊、公羊或公山羊；当用牛献祭时，就用公牛、小牛或牛犊；所有这些都表示各种属天和属灵之物（参看<a href="922.htm">922</a>，<a href="1823.htm">1823</a>，<a href="2180.htm">2180</a>节）；人们用它们来献祭（<a href="2776.htm">2776</a>节）。由此可见，以撒的提问，就是“燔祭的羊羔在哪里呢”表示那些要成圣的人类成员在哪呢？这一点从下文，也就是他父亲亚伯拉罕的回答看得更清楚，即“神必自己看顾作燔祭的羊羔”（8节），这表示神性人会预备那些要成圣的人。这一点也可从以下事实明显看出来：后来亚伯拉罕见后面有一只燔祭的公羊，两角缠在灌木丛中（13节），这表示属于主的属灵教会的人类成员。这一点同样从14-17节经文中的细节明显看出来。</p>

Where is the lamb [pecus] for a burnt-offering? That this signifies, Where are they from the human race who are to be sanctified? is evident from the representation of sacrifices, especially of burnt-offerings. 
That burnt-offerings and sacrifices were representative of internal worship, may be seen above (n. 922, 923); that they were made from the flock and from the herd; that when made from the 
flock, they consisted of lambs, sheep, she-goats, kids, rams, he-goats, and when from the herd, of oxen, bullocks, or calves; and that these signified various kinds of celestial and spiritual things (n. 
922, 1823, 2180); also that by means of them sanctifications were to be effected (n. 2776). It may be seen from this, that by Isaac's inquiry, "Where is the lamb for a burnt-offering?" is signified, 
Where are they from the human race who are to be sanctified?-which is more plainly manifest from what follows, that is, from the answer of Abraham his father, "God will see for Himself the lamb for 
a burnt-offering" (verse 8); by which is signified that the Divine Human will provide those who are to be sanctified. This is also evident from the fact that a ram was afterwards seen behind them, held 
by the horns in a thicket, which was offered for a burnt-offering (verse 13), by which are signified those of the human race who are of the Lord's spiritual church. And the same is evident from what 
follows in verses 14 to 17. </p>

'Where is the animal for a burnt offering?' means, Where are those members of the human race who are to be sanctified? This is clear from the representation of sacrifices, in particular burnt offerings. 
Burnt offerings and sacrifices were representative of internal worship, see <a href="922.htm">922</a>, <a href="923.htm">923</a>; they were made from the flock and from the herd - when from the flock, lambs, sheep, she-goats, kids, rams, or 
he-goats were used, when from the herd, oxen, young bulls, or calves, all of which meant various kinds of celestial and spiritual things - see <a href="922.htm">922</a>, <a href="1823.htm">1823</a>, <a href="2180.htm">2180</a>; and by means of them people were sanctified, <a href="2776.htm">2776</a>. From all this it may become clear that Isaac's question, 'Where is the animal for the burnt offering?' means, Where are those members of the human race who are to be sanctified? The same is 
more plainly evident from what comes next, that is to say, from the reply made by Abraham his father, 'God will see for Himself to the animal for a burnt offering', verse 8, which means that the Divine 
Human will provide those who are to be sanctified; from the fact that later on he saw a ram behind him caught by its horns in a thicket, and offered that as the burnt offering, verse 13, which means 
members of the human race who belong to the Lord's spiritual Church; as well as from the details that follow after this in verses 14-17. </p>

`Ubi pecus ad holocaustum?' quod significet ubi illi genere humano qui sanctificentur, constat ex repraesentatione sacrificiorum, imprimis holocaustorum; quod holocausta et sacrificia fuerint repraesentativa 
cultus interni, videatur n. 922, 923; et quod facta ex grege et ex armento; dum ex grege, quod ex agnis, ovibus, capris, haedis, arietibus, hircis {1}, cum ex armento, quod ex bovibus juvencis 
aut vitulis, quae quod caelestium et spiritualium varia genera significaverint, videatur n. 922, 1823, 2180; et quod per illa sanctificarentur, n. 2776; inde constare potest, quod per interrogationem 
Jishaki `ubi pecus ad holocaustum' significetur ubi illi ex gen humano qui sanctificentur; quod manifestius {2} patet a sequentibus, nempe a responso Abrahami patris, `Deus videbit Sibi pecudem holocaustum,'
