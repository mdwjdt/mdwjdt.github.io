<h3 align="center" class="ired">属天的奥秘 第6340节</h3>
<h4 align="center"></h4><p><strong>6340.</strong>“要听你们父亲以色列的话”表属灵良善所作的关于它们的预言；在至高意义上表主的预见。这从“听”的含义和“以色列”的代表清楚可知：“听”，即“听”末后之日必遇的事，是指预言；“以色列”是指属灵良善（参看<a href="5801.htm">5801</a>，<a href="5803.htm">5803</a>，<a href="5806.htm">5806</a>，<a href="5812.htm">5812</a>，<a href="5817.htm">5817</a>，<a href="5819.htm">5819</a>，<a href="5826.htm">5826</a>，<a href="5833.htm">5833</a>节）。由于听“末后之日必遇的事”因在内义上表示预言，故在至高意义上表示主的预见，因为一切预言皆来自主的预见。当经上说“雅各的儿子们要听以色列”时，意思是说，那些属教会的人要听主，也就是在圣言中听祂，听祂在那里所教导关于信之真理和爱之良善的话，以及祂对那些拥有雅各的这个或那个儿子所表示的某个真理或某种良善之人的预言。例如，他们要听祂对那些处于此处由“流便”、“西缅”和“利未”所表示的与仁分离之信的人所教导和预言的话；或听祂对那些由“犹大”所表示的属天良善之人和那些处于由“约瑟”所表示的属灵良善之人，以及那些处于诸如由其他儿子所表示的那类事物之人所教导和预言的话。</p>

And hear unto Israel your father. That this signifies a prediction about them by spiritual good, in the supreme sense the Lord's foresight, is evident from the signification of "hearing," namely, what 
shall happen in the end of the days, as being prediction; and from the representation of Israel, as being spiritual good (see n. 5801, 5803, 5806, 5812, 5817, 5819, 5826, 5833); and because prediction 
is signified in the internal sense by "hearing what shall befall in the end of the days," the foresight of the Lord is signified in the supreme sense, for all prediction is from the Lord's foresight. 
Its being said that the "sons of Jacob should hear to Israel," signifies that they who are of the church should hear the Lord, that is, should hear Him in the Word, and what He there teaches with respect 
to the truths of faith and the goods of love, and what He predicts with respect to those who are in such truth and good as are signified by one or another son of Jacob; as what He teaches and predicts 
about those in faith separate from charity, here signified by "Reuben," "Simeon," and "Levi;" or about those in celestial good, signified by "Judah;" also about those in spiritual good, signified 
by "Joseph;" thus also about those who are in such things as are signified by the rest of the sons. </p>

<p align="center"><b>Elliott(1983-1999) 6340</b></p><p><b>6340.</b>
'And hear Israel your father' means a foretelling regarding them made by spiritual good, in the highest sense the Lord's foresight. This is clear from the meaning of 'hearing' - hearing what will happen 
at the end of days - as a foretelling; and from the representation of 'Israel' as spiritual good, as in <a href="5801.htm">5801</a>, <a href="5803.htm">5803</a>, <a href="5806.htm">5806</a>, <a href="5812.htm">5812</a>, <a href="5817.htm">5817</a>, <a href="5819.htm">5819</a>, <a href="5826.htm">5826</a>, <a href="5833.htm">5833</a>. And since a foretelling is meant in the internal 
sense by 'hearing what will happen at the end of days', the Lord's foresight is meant in the highest sense; for the Lord's foresight is the source of every foretelling that is made. When it says 
that the sons of Jacob should hear Israel, the meaning is that those who belong to the Church should hear the Lord, that is, hear Him in the Word. They should hear what He teaches there about the truths 
of faith and forms of the good of love, and what He foretells about those in possession of some truth or form of good meant by one or another son of Jacob. They should hear for example what He teaches 
and foretells about people with whom faith exists separated from charity, who are meant here by Reuben, Simeon, and Levi; about those with whom celestial good is present, who are meant by Judah; about 
those with whom spiritual good is present, who are meant by 'Joseph'; and so also about those with whom whatever is meant by the rest of Jacob's sons is present. </p>

`Et audite ad Israelem patrem vestrum':  quod significet praedictionem de illis a bono spirituali, in supremo sensu praevidentiam Domini, constat a significatione `audire', nempe quid continget in postremitate 
dierum, quod sit praedictionem; et a repraesentatione `Israelis' quod sit bonum spirituale, ut n. 5801, 5803, 5806, 5812, 5817, 5819, (x)5826, 5833; et quia praedictio per `audire quid continget 
in postremitate dierum' significatur in sensu interno, significatur praevidentia Domini in sensu supremo, nam a praevidentia Domini est omnis praedictio.  Quod dicatur quod `filii Jacobi audirent 
ad Israelem' significat quod illi qui ab Ecclesia sunt, audirent Dominum, hoc est, Ipsum in Verbo, quid ibi docet de veris fidei et de bonis amoris, et quid praedicit de illis qui in tali vero et bono 
sunt, quae significantur per unum aut alterum filium Jacobi, sicut quid docet et praedicit de illis qui in fide separata sunt a charitate, qui significantur hic per `Reubenem, Shimeonem et Levi'; 
{1}aut de illis qui in bono caelesti {2}sunt et significantur per `Jehudam'; tum quid de illis qui in bono spirituali, qui significantur per `Josephum'; ita quoque de illis qui in talibus quae significantur 
per reliquos. @1 et$ @2 qui$ </p>
