<h3 align="center" class="ired">属天的奥秘 第9987节</h3>
<h4 align="center"></h4><p><strong>9987.</strong>“这是你要对他们所做的事”表秩序的一个律法。这从“事或话”的含义清楚可知，“事或话”是指神性真理和由此而来的秩序的一个律法，如下文所述。就一般意义而言，“话”表示口中所说的话，或言语；由于言语是通过发出的声音来表达的心智的思维，所以“话”也表示正在思想的事。这解释了为何在原文，凡真实存在，的确为某物之物被称为“话”。但“话”在更宏大的意义上是指神性真理，因为凡真实存在，的确为某物之物都是神性真理。因此，诗篇上说：<br />诸天藉耶和华的话而造；其万象藉着祂口中的灵（或气）而成。（诗篇<a href="http://39-27.cn/诗33.6.htm">33:6</a>）<br />此处“耶和华的话”是指从主发出的神性真理；“耶和华口中的灵或气”是指祂的真理所带来的生命；藉祂的话而造的“诸天”，以及“其万象”是指天使，不过是在他们成为神性真理的接受者的程度之内。“诸天”之所以表示天使，是因为他们构成天堂。此外，由于天使是神性真理的接受者，所以“天使”在抽象意义上表示从主发出的神性真理（参看<a href="8192.htm">8192</a>节）；“天上的万象”在抽象意义上同样表示神性真理（参看<a href="3448.htm">3448</a>，<a href="7236.htm">7236</a>，<a href="7988.htm">7988</a>节）。<br />由此可见约翰福音中的“圣言”表示什么：<br />太初有圣言，圣言与神同在，神就是圣言。万物是藉着祂造的；凡被造的，没有一样不是藉着祂造的。圣言成了肉身，住在我们中间，我们也见过祂的荣光。（约翰福音<a href="http://39-27.cn/约1.1.htm">1:1</a>，<a href="http://39-27.cn/约1.3.htm">3</a>，<a href="http://39-27.cn/约1.14.htm">14</a>）<br />“圣言”在此表示主，这是显而易见的，因为经上说“圣言成了肉身”。主是圣言，因为当主在世时，祂就是神性真理本身；当主离开这个世界时，神性真理就从祂发出了（参看<a href="9199.htm">9199</a>e，<a href="9315.htm">9315</a>e节所提到的地方）。<br />就至高意义而言，“圣言”（即话）是指神性真理方面的主，或也可说，圣言就是从主发出的神性真理。这一点从众多经文明显看出来，如下列经文：<br />他们呼求耶和华，祂发出自己的话语医治他们。（诗篇<a href="http://39-27.cn/诗107.19.htm">107:19</a>，<a href="http://39-27.cn/诗107.20.htm">20</a>）<br />约翰福音：<br />你们并没有父的话存在你们里面，因为祂所差来的，你们不信，你们不肯到我这里来得生命。（约翰福音<a href="http://39-27.cn/约5.38.htm">5:38</a>，<a href="http://39-27.cn/约5.40.htm">40</a>）<br />同一福音书：<br />我已将你的圣言赐给他们。世界又恨他们，求你用真理使他们分别成圣，你的话就是真理。（约翰福音<a href="http://39-27.cn/约17.14.htm">17:14</a>，<a href="http://39-27.cn/约17.17.htm">17</a>）<br />启示录：<br />骑在白马上的穿着溅了血的衣服，祂的名称为神的圣言。在祂衣服和大腿上有名写着，万王之王，万主之主。（启示录<a href="http://39-27.cn/启19.13.htm">19:13</a>，<a href="http://39-27.cn/启19.16.htm">16</a>）<br />从这些和其它经文清楚看出，从主发出的神性真理就是“圣言或话”，在至高意义上则是神性真理方面的主；因为经上说“骑在白马上的名称为神的圣”，祂是“万王之王，万主之主”。由于“圣言”是指神性真理，故经上说祂“穿着溅了血的衣服”，因为“衣服”表示真理（<a href="9952.htm">9952</a>节），“血”表示源于良善的真理。详细解释可参看前文（<a href="2760.htm">2760</a>-<a href="2762.htm">2762</a>节）。<br />这解释了为何来自神的一切真理都被称为祂的话，如约珥书：<br />耶和华在祂军队前发出响声，祂的营地甚大；执行祂话的，不能数算。（约珥书<a href="http://39-27.cn/珥2.11.htm">2:11</a>）<br />耶和华发出的“响声”是指从神来的真理（<a href="9926.htm">9926</a>节）；“耶和华的营地”是指天堂（参看<a href="4236.htm">4236</a>，<a href="8193.htm">8193</a>，<a href="8196.htm">8196</a>节）；由此明显可知“执行祂话的，不能数算”表示那些遵行神之真理的人。马太福音：<br />凡听见天国的话不明白的，那恶者就来，把所撒在他心里的夺了去。撒在石头地上的，就是人听了话，当下欢喜领受，然而他没有根。撒在荆棘里的，就是人听了话，而今世的思虑，钱财的迷惑，把话挤住了；撒在好地上的，就是人听话明白了，又结出果实来。（马太福音<a href="http://39-27.cn/太13.19.htm">13:19</a>-<a href="http://39-27.cn/太13.23.htm">23</a>）<br />“话”在此是指神之真理，这是显而易见的，无需解释。经上之所以说“天国的话”，是因为它是天堂和教会的真理，因为“天国”是指天堂和教会。<br />由此可见，“话”表示来自主的神性真理；如约翰福音：<br />我对你们所说的话就是灵，就是生命。（约翰福音<a href="http://39-27.cn/约6.63.htm">6:63</a>）<br />因此，十诫也被称为“十句话”（出埃及记<a href="http://39-27.cn/出34.28.htm">34:28</a>）。“话”之所以是指秩序的一个律法，是因为从主发出的神性真理带来天堂里的秩序，以致它构成那里的秩序。因此，天堂秩序的律法由神性真理构成（<a href="1728.htm">1728</a>，<a href="1919.htm">1919</a>，<a href="2258.htm">2258</a>，<a href="2447.htm">2447</a>，<a href="4839.htm">4839</a>，<a href="5703.htm">5703</a>，<a href="7995.htm">7995</a>，<a href="8513.htm">8513</a>，<a href="8700.htm">8700</a>，<a href="8988.htm">8988</a>节）。本章的“话”所表示的秩序律法就是主荣耀祂人身，也就是把它变成神性的方式。这就是此处内义上所论述的主题；由此而来的相对意义上的主题则是人的重生，因为人的重生就是主之荣耀的一个形像（<a href="3138.htm">3138</a>，<a href="3212.htm">3212</a>，<a href="3245.htm">3245</a>，<a href="3246.htm">3246</a>，<a href="3296.htm">3296</a>，<a href="4402.htm">4402</a>，<a href="5688.htm">5688</a>节）。这尤其是秩序的律法，因为主的神性人身构成天堂里的秩序，凡正在重生的人都在被重塑，以适合这秩序。因此，那些处于这种秩序的人住在主里面。</p>

And this is the word that thou shalt do to them. That this signifies a law of order, is evident from the signification of a "word," as being Divine truth, and hence a law of order (of which below). In 
the general sense a "word" signifies an utterance of the mouth, or a speech; and as a speech is a thought of the mind uttered by means of words, therefore a "word" signifies the thing that is being 
thought; and from this, in the original tongue, everything that really exists, and is anything, is called a "word." But in an eminent sense the "Word" is Divine truth, for the reason that everything which 
really exists, and which is anything, is from Divine truth. Therefore it is said in David: </p>
<p>     By the word of Jehovah were the heavens made, and all the army of them by the breath of His mouth 
(Ps. 33:6); </p>
<p>where "the word of Jehovah" denotes the Divine truth that proceeds from the Lord; "the breath of the mouth of Jehovah" denotes the life thence derived; "the heavens made by it, and all the 
army of them," denote the angels insofar as they are receptions of Divine truth. That "the heavens" denote the angels is because these constitute heaven; and as the angels are receptions of Divine truth, 
therefore by "angels" in the abstract sense are signified Divine truths which are from the Lord (see n. 8192); and that in the same sense "the army of the heavens" denotes Divine truths (see n. 
3448, 7236, 7988). [2] From this it can be seen what is signified by "the Word" in John: </p>
<p>     In the beginning was the Word, and the Word was with God, and God was the Word. All things were made by 
Him, and without Him was not anything made that was made. And the Word was made flesh, and dwelt in us, and we saw His glory (John 1:1, 3, 14). That the Lord is here meant by "the Word" is plain, for 
it is said that "the Word was made flesh." The Lord is "the Word," because when He was in the world, the Lord was Divine truth itself; and when He departed out of the world, the Divine truth proceeded 
from Him (see the places cited in n. 9199, 9315). [3] That in the supreme sense "the Word" denotes the Lord as to Divine truth, or what is the same, that "the Word" denotes the Divine truth proceeding 
from the Lord, is evident from many passages, as in the following: </p>
<p>     They cried unto Jehovah, and He sent His Word, and healed them (Ps. 107:19, 20).      Ye have not the Word of the Father abiding 
in you, because whom He hath sent, Him ye believe not, and ye will not come to Me, that ye may have life (John 5:38, 40).      I have given them Thy word, therefore the world hateth them, sanctify 
them in Thy truth; Thy word is truth (John 17:14, 17).      He that sat on the white horse was clothed in a garment dipped in blood, and His name is called the Word of God. And He had upon His garment 
and upon His thigh a name written, King of kings, and Lord of lords (Rev. 19:13, 16). From these and other passages it is evident that the Divine truth proceeding from the Lord is "the Word," 
and in the supreme sense the Lord as to Divine truth, for it is said that "the name of Him who sat on the white horse is the Word of God," and that "He is King of kings and Lord of lords;" and as "the 
Word" denotes Divine truth, it is said that "He was clothed in a garment dipped in blood," for by "garment" is signified truth (n. 9952), and by "blood" truth from good. (See this more fully explained 
in n. 2760-2762.) [4] Hence all truth which is from the Divine is called the "word," as in Joel: </p>
<p>     Jehovah uttered His voice before His army; for His camp is very great, for countless is he that 
doeth His word (Joel 2:11); </p>
<p>where the "voice which Jehovah utters" denotes truth from the Divine (n. 9926); the "camp of Jehovah" denotes heaven (see n. 4236, 8193, 8196). From this it is evident that 
"countless is he that doeth His word" denotes one who does truth Divine. In Matthew: </p>
<p>     When anyone heareth the word of the kingdom, and heedeth it not, the evil one cometh and snatcheth away that 
which was sown in his heart. He that was sown upon stony places, is he that heareth the word and straightway with joy receiveth it; yet hath he not root. He that was sown among thorns, is he that 
heareth the word, but the care of the age and the deceitfulness of riches choke the word. He that was sown in good ground, is he that heareth the word and payeth attention, and from this bringeth forth 
fruit (Matt. 13:19-23). That "the word" here denotes truth Divine is evident without explication. It is said "the word of the kingdom," because it is the truth of heaven and the church, for "the kingdom" 
denotes heaven and the church. [5] From this it can be seen that "words" denote Divine truths which are from the Lord; as in John: </p>
<p>     The words that I speak unto you, are spirit and are life 
(John 6:63). Therefore also the commandments of the Decalogue are called the "ten words" (Exod. 34:28). That "the word" denotes a law of order, is because the Divine truth that proceeds from the Lord 
makes order in the heavens, insomuch that it is order there. Hence the laws of heavenly order are Divine truths (n 1728, 1919, 2258, 2447, 4839, 5703, 7995, 8513, 8700, 8988). The law of order which 
is signified by "word" in this chapter is the way in which the Lord glorified His Human, that is, made it Divine, for this is the subject here treated of in the internal sense; and from this in the 
relative sense the regeneration of man is treated of, for the regeneration of man is an image of the glorification of the Lord (n. 3138, 3212, 3245, 3246, 3296, 4402, 5688). That this is the law of order 
in especial, is because the Lord as to the Divine Human is Order in the heavens, and because everyone who is being regenerated is brought into this order; wherefore they who are in this order are 
in the Lord. </p>

<p align="center"><b>Elliott(1983-1999) 9987</b></p><p><b>9987.</b>
'And this is the word which you shall do to them' means a law of order. This is clear from the meaning of 'the word' as Divine Truth, and consequently a law of order, dealt with below. The ordinary 
meaning of 'word' is an expression spoken by the mouth, or utterance; and since utterance is thought taking place in the mind which is expressed by means of vocal sounds, 'word' also means a thing that 
is being thought about. This explains why in the original language whatever comes into actual being and is indeed something is called 'a word'. But a grander meaning of 'word' is Divine Truth, because 
the source of all that comes into being and is indeed something is Divine Truth. This accounts for the statement in David,  </p>
<blockquote>
By the Word of Jehovah were the heavens made, and all their host by the 
Spirit of His mouth. <a href="http://bible.gospelcom.net/cgi-bin/bible?passage=Ps%2033:6&amp;version=ESV&amp;interface=print&amp;showfn=yes&amp;showxref">Ps 33:6</a>.  
</blockquote>
<p>Here 'the Word of Jehovah' is Divine Truth emanating from the Lord; 'the Spirit of Jehovah's mouth' is the life brought by His Truth; and 'the heavens' made by His 
Word, also 'all their host', are angels, to the extent that they are recipients of Divine Truth. The reason why angels are meant by 'the heavens' is that they constitute heaven. Furthermore, since angels 
are recipients of Divine Truth, Divine Truths coming from the Lord are meant by them in the abstract sense, see <a href="8192.htm">8192</a>; and in that same sense 'the host of the heavens' means Divine Truths, <a href="3448.htm">3448</a>, <a href="7236.htm">7236</a>, <a href="7988.htm">7988</a>.  </p>
<p></p>
<p><b>[2]</b>
 From this it becomes clear what 'the Word' means in John,  </p>
<blockquote>
In the beginning was the Word, and the Word was with God, and the Word was God. All things were made through Him, and without 
Him nothing was made that was made. And the Word became flesh and dwelt among us; and we saw His glory. <a href="http://bible.gospelcom.net/cgi-bin/bible?passage=John%201:1,3,14&amp;version=ESV&amp;interface=print&amp;showfn=yes&amp;showxref">John 1:1,3,14</a>.  
</blockquote>
<p>Here it is self-evident that the Word is used to mean the Lord, for it 
says that the Word became flesh. The Lord is the Word because while He was in the world the Lord was Divine Truth itself; and since His departure from the world Divine Truth has emanated from Him, see 
the places referred to in <a href="9199.htm">9199</a>(end), <a href="9315.htm">9315</a>(end).  </p>
<p></p>
<p><b>[3]</b>
 In the highest sense the Word is the Lord in respect of Divine Truth, or what amounts to the same thing, the Word is Divine Truth emanating from 
the Lord. This is clear from very many places, for example in David,  </p>
<blockquote>
They cried out to Jehovah, and He sent His Word and healed them. <a href="http://bible.gospelcom.net/cgi-bin/bible?passage=Ps%20107:19,20&amp;version=ESV&amp;interface=print&amp;showfn=yes&amp;showxref">Ps 107:19,20</a>.  
</blockquote>
<p>In John,  </p>
<blockquote>
You do not have the Father's 
word abiding in you, because the One whom He has sent, Him you do not believe; nor are you willing to come to Me that you may have life. <a href="http://bible.gospelcom.net/cgi-bin/bible?passage=John%205:38,40&amp;version=ESV&amp;interface=print&amp;showfn=yes&amp;showxref">John 5:38,40</a>.  
</blockquote>
<p>In the same gospel,  </p>
<blockquote>
I have given them Your 
word; therefore the world hates them. Sanctify them in Your truth; Your word is truth. <a href="http://bible.gospelcom.net/cgi-bin/bible?passage=John%2017:14,17&amp;version=ESV&amp;interface=print&amp;showfn=yes&amp;showxref">John 17:14,17</a>.  
</blockquote>
<p>And in the Book of Revelation,  </p>
<blockquote>
The One seated on the white horse was clothed in a garment 
dyed with blood, and His name is called The Word of God. And on His garment and on His thigh He had a name written, King of kings and Lord of lords. <a href="http://bible.gospelcom.net/cgi-bin/bible?passage=Rev%2019:13,16&amp;version=ESV&amp;interface=print&amp;showfn=yes&amp;showxref">Rev 19:13,16</a>.  
</blockquote>
<p>From these and many other places 
it is clear that Divine Truth emanating from the Lord is meant by 'the Word', and in the highest sense the Lord in respect of Divine Truth; for it says that the name of the One seated on the white 
horse is The Word of God, and that He is King of kings and Lord of lords. And since the Word is Divine Truth it says that He was clothed in a garment dyed with blood, for 'garment' means truth, <a href="9952.htm">9952</a>, 
and 'blood' truth from good, <a href="9393.htm">9393</a>. For a fuller explanation of these things, see <a href="2760.htm">2760</a>-<a href="2762.htm">2762</a>.  </p>
<p></p>
<p><b>[4]</b>
 This now explains why every truth that comes from God is called His word, as in Joel,  </p>
<blockquote>
Jehovah 
uttered His voice before His army, His camp is exceedingly great; for those who execute His word are uncountable. <a href="http://bible.gospelcom.net/cgi-bin/bible?passage=Joel%202:11&amp;version=ESV&amp;interface=print&amp;showfn=yes&amp;showxref">Joel 2:11</a>.  
</blockquote>
<p>'The voice' which Jehovah utters is the truth from God, <a href="9926.htm">9926</a>, Jehovah's 
'camp' is heaven, <a href="4236.htm">4236</a>, <a href="8193.htm">8193</a>, <a href="8196.htm">8196</a>, from which it is evident that 'those who execute His word are uncountable' means those who do God's truth. In Matthew,  </p>
<blockquote>
[As for the one] who hears the word of the 
kingdom and does not give heed to it, the evil one comes and snatches away what has been sown in his heart. [The one] who has been sown on stony ground is he who hears the word and immediately receives 
it with joy; yet he has no root. [The one] who is sown among thorns is he who hears the word but the cares of this world<A name="fntext1"></a><A href="#fn1"><sup>a</sup></a> and the deceitfulness of riches choke the word. [The one] who is sown in 
good soil is he who hears the word and gives heed to it, and consequently bears fruit. <a href="http://bible.gospelcom.net/cgi-bin/bible?passage=Matt%2013:19-23&amp;version=ESV&amp;interface=print&amp;showfn=yes&amp;showxref">Matt 13:19-23</a>.  
</blockquote>
<p>It is evident without explanation that 'the word' here is God's truth. The expression 'the word 
of the kingdom' is used because it is the truth that is heaven and the Church's; for 'the kingdom' means heaven and the Church.  </p>
<p></p>
<p><b>[5]</b>
 From all this it becomes clear that 'words' means Divine Truths 
that come from the Lord, as in John,  </p>
<blockquote>
The words that I speak to you, they are spirit and they are life. <a href="http://bible.gospelcom.net/cgi-bin/bible?passage=John%206:63&amp;version=ESV&amp;interface=print&amp;showfn=yes&amp;showxref">John 6:63</a>.  
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
Therefore also the ten commandments are called Ten Words in <a href="http://bible.gospelcom.net/cgi-bin/bible?passage=Exod%2034:28&amp;version=ESV&amp;interface=print&amp;showfn=yes&amp;showxref">Exod 34:28</a>. 
</blockquote>
The 
reason why 'the word' is a law of order is that Divine Truth emanating from the Lord brings order to the heavens, to such an extent that it constitutes order there. Consequently the laws of heavenly 
order consist of Divine Truths, see <a href="1728.htm">1728</a>, <a href="1919.htm">1919</a>, <a href="2258.htm">2258</a>, <a href="2447.htm">2447</a>, <a href="4839.htm">4839</a>, <a href="5703.htm">5703</a>, <a href="7995.htm">7995</a>, <a href="8513.htm">8513</a>, <a href="8700.htm">8700</a>, <a href="8988.htm">8988</a>. The law of order meant by 'the word' in this chapter is the manner in which the Lord glorified His Human, 
that is, made it Divine. This is the subject here in the internal sense, the subject in the relative sense consequently being human regeneration, since human regeneration is an image of the glorification 
of the Lord, <a href="3138.htm">3138</a>, <a href="3212.htm">3212</a>, <a href="3245.htm">3245</a>, <a href="3246.htm">3246</a>, <a href="3296.htm">3296</a>, <a href="4402.htm">4402</a>, <a href="5688.htm">5688</a>. The reason why this in particular is a law of order is that the Lord's Divine Human constitutes order in the heavens and everyone who is being 
regenerated is being remade to conform to that order. Those therefore with whom that order exists abide in the Lord.

sit Dominus quoad Divinum Verum, seu quod idem, quod Verbum sit Divinum Verum procedens {5}a Domino, constat a pluribus locis, ut apud Davidem, 	Clamaverunt ad Jehovam, et misit Verbum Suum, et sanavit 
eos, Ps. cvii [19,] 20: </p>
<p>apud Johannem, 	Verbum Patris non habetis manens in vobis, (m)quia Quem misit Ille, Huic vos non creditis: nec vultis venire ad Me ut vitam habeatis,(n) v 38, 40: </p>
<p>apud eundem, 	Ego 
dedi illis verbum Tuum, ideo mundus odio habet eos; sanctifica eos in veritate Tua; verbum Tuum veritas est, xvii 14, 17: </p>
<p>et in Apocalypsi, 	Insidens equo albo, indutus erat vestimento tincto 
sanguine, et vocatur nomen Ipsius Verbum Dei; et habebat super vestimento Suo, et super femore Suo, nomen scriptum, Rex regum et Dominus dominorum, xix 13, 16; </p>
<p>ex his et ex {6} aliis locis constat 
quod Divinum Verum procedens a Domino sit Verbum, et in supremo sensu Dominus quoad Divinum Verum, nam dicitur quod nomen insidentis equo albo sit Verbum Dei, et quod Ille sit Rex regum, et Dominus 
dominorum; et quia Verbum est Divinum Verum, ideo dicitur quod indutus esset vestimento tincto sanguine, nam per `vestimentum' significatur verum, n. 9952, et per `sanguinem' verum ex bono, n. 9393, 
(n)videantur haec plenius explicata n.2760-2762. 	Inde est quod omne verum quod a Divino, dicatur Verbum, ut 4 apud Joelem, 	Jehovah edidit vocem Suam coram exercitu Suo, magna valde castra Ipsius, 
(x)quia innumerus qui facit verbum Ipsius, ii 11; </p>
<p>{7} 'vox quam edit Jehovah' est verum a Divino, n. 9926, `castra Jehovae' sunt caelum, n. 4236, 8193, 8196; inde patet quod `innumerus qui facit verbum' 
sit qui facit verum Divinum: apud Matthaeum, 	Qui audit verbum regni et non attendit, venit malus et rapit quod seminatum est in corde ejus: qui super petrosa seminatus, est qui verbum audit, et 
statim cum gaudio accipit illud, non autem habet radicem: qui inter spinas seminatus, est qui verbum audit, sed cura saeculi et fraus divitiarum suffocat verbum: qui in terram bonam seminatus, est qui 
verbum audit et attendit, et inde fructum fert, xiii 19-23; </p>
<p>quod `verbum' ibi sit verum Divinum, absque explicatione patet; `verbum regni' dicitur, quia est verum {8}caeli et Ecclesiae, nam regnum 
est caelum et Ecclesia. 	Inde constare potest quod verba sint Divina Vera quae a Domino, 5 ut apud Johannem, 	Verba quae Ego loquor vobis, spiritus sunt et vita sunt, vi 63; {9}ideo quoque praecepta 
decalogi vocantur decem verba, Exod. xxxiv 28.  Quod Verbum sit lex ordinis, est quia Divinum Verum procedens a Domino (x)facit ordinem in caelis, usque adeo ut id ibi sit ordo, inde leges ordinis caelestis 
sunt Divina Vera, videatur n. 1728, 1919, (x)2447, 2258, 4839, 5703, 7995, 8513, 8700, 8988. (m)Lex ordinis, quae significatur per `verbum' in hoc capite, est quomodo Dominus Humanum Suum glorificavit, 
hoc est, Divinum fecit, nam de illa re in sensu interno hic agitur, et inde in sensu respectivo de regeneratione hominis, nam regeneratio hominis est imago glorificationis Domini, {10} n. (x)3138, 
3212, 3245, 3246, 3296, 4402, 5688; quod id imprimis (t)sit lex ordinis, est quia Dominus quoad Divinum Humanum est ordo in caelis; et quia omnis qui regeneratur, ad illum ordinem redigitur; quapropter 
qui in illo ordine sunt, in Domino sunt.(n) @1 d seu i ita$ @2 i etiam$ @3 d dicitur verbum i vocatur Verbum$ @4 i manifeste$ @5 d a Domino i ab Ipso$ @6 i pluribus$ @7 i vox Jehovae
