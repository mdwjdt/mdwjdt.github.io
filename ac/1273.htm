<h3 align="center" class="ired">属天的奥秘 第1273节</h3>
<h4 align="center"></h4><p><h4 align="center">第11章  关于大人的位置；以及来世的地方和距离</h4><br />1273.刚离世的灵魂在即将离开属灵天使的陪伴去往灵人界，最后进入他们肉身生活时所在的社群时，会被天使带到很多宅邸或住所，也就是社群，这些社群既独立又与其它社群相联。他们在有些社群会被接纳，但有时则被带到其它社群。这一过程会一直持续下去，没有时间限制，直到他们抵达肉身生活时所在的社群，然后留在那里，这标志着他们新生活的开始。这个人若是冒名顶替者、伪君子或骗子，就是会伪装、能假扮天使气质的那类人，有时会被善灵接纳，但不久就被分离出去。然后他们四处游荡，没有天使陪伴，并乞求接纳，却遭到拒绝，有时还会受到惩罚，最后沦落地狱。那些经历消磨后被天使接纳的人也会经历社群的变化。当从一个社群转到另一个社群时，他们会被彬彬有礼地打发离开，这一过程会持续到他们来到与自己的仁爱、虔诚、正直或真诚礼貌的独特品质或天性相一致的天使社群为止。我也以同样的方式被引领经过这类“宅邸”，住在那里的人与我交谈，以便我能了解有关这个问题的情况。当时，我得以反思地方的变化，发现它们无非是状态的变化，我的身体仍呆在原来的地方。</p>

When the time comes for this, angels take them around to a number of residential areas, which are separate communities (though interconnected). In some places the newcomers are welcomed; in others they are sent on. This continues for some time until they reach the community they resided in while they lived in their bodies, and there they stay. From that moment, their lives start afresh.<br />When people are insincere, hypocritical, or dishonest, and can deceptively adopt an angelic-seeming personality, good spirits sometimes accept them, but before long they are banished. Then they wander around without angels to escort them, begging to be taken in but meeting with rejection and sometimes punishment. In the end they are relegated to the company of hellish spirits.<br />[2] People who are released from spiritual devastation{*1} to the companionship of angels also change communities, and when they pass from one to another, they are sent on their way politely and with kindness. The process repeats itself until they finally arrive in a community of angels that harmonizes with their disposition for charity, devoutness, honesty, or genuine courtesy.<br />I was also escorted in the same way through various neighborhoods, where the residents talked with me, so that I could learn what the experience was like. Meanwhile, I was given the opportunity to reflect on these changes of place and to realize that they were only apparent moves — that my state alone changed, while my body stayed put.<br /><br /><strong>Footnotes:</strong><br />{*1} Spiritual devastation is described in <a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_1273/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_1106" target=_top>1106-1113</a>.

CHAPTER 11 CONCERNING THE SITUATION OF THE GRAND MAN; AND ALSO CONCERNING PLACE AND DISTANCE IN THE OTHER LIFE Souls newly arrived from the world, when about to leave the company of the spiritual angels 
to go among spirits, and so at length to come into the society in which they had been while they lived in the body, are led about by angels to many mansions or abodes, that is, to societies which 
are distinct and yet conjoined with others; in some of which they are received, while in other cases they are led to still other societies, and this for an indefinite time, until they come to the society 
in which they had been while they lived in the body; and there they remain. From this moment they experience a new beginning of life. If the man is a dissembler, a hypocrite, or deceitful, who can 
assume a fictitious state, and a seemingly angelic disposition, he is sometimes received by good spirits; but after a short time he is dissociated, and then wanders about, without the angels, and begs 
to be received, but is rejected, and sometimes punished, and at last he is carried down among the infernals. Those who are taken up among angels after being vastated, also change their societies, 
and when they pass from one society to another they are dismissed with courtesy and charity, and this until they come into the angelic society which accords with the distinctive quality or genius of their 
charity, piety, probity, or sincere courtesy. I in like manner have been led through such "mansions," and those who dwelt there conversed with me, that I might know how the case was in regard to 
this matter. It was given me at the time to reflect on the changes of place, and to see that they were nothing else than changes of state, my body remaining in the same place. </p>

POSITION IN THE GRAND MAN, ALSO PLACE AND DISTANCE IN THE NEXT LIFE </p>
<p>When the time has come to allow souls recently arrived from the world to leave the company of spiritual angels in order to enter 
that of spirits and at length to enter the community which they were in during their lifetime, they are carried by angels around to many dwelling-places, which are separate communities yet joined to 
others. At each place they are taken in and then move on to other communities. This continues for some time until they reach the community which they were in during their lifetime; and there they stay. 
This marks a new beginning to their life. If someone is an impostor, a hypocrite, or deceitful - one who is able to assume a deceptive state and a seemingly angelic disposition - he is sometimes received 
by good spirits. But in a little while the association is broken, and then he wanders around unaccompanied by the angels, and begs to be received. He is however rejected, and sometimes punished, 
till at length he comes down to be among those in hell. Those who, after they have been vastated, are borne away to be among angels - they too pass from one community to another. And when they move on 
from one to another, those whom they are leaving allow them to go with civility and charity; and this continues until they reach the angelic community that accords with their own kind of charity, true 
piety, honesty, or genuine civility. So that I might know about all this I too have been conducted in a similar way through those dwelling-places, and those who are there have talked to me. I was at 
that time allowed to reflect on changes of place, that they were merely apparent, and that they were nothing else than changes of state, with the body remaining where it was. </p>

GENESEOS                       CAPUT UNDECIMUM 	  De Situ Maximi Hominis: tum de Loco et Distantia,  				   in altera vita </p>
<p>Animae recentes e mundo, cum dimittendae e consortio 
angelorum spiritualium ut veniant inter spiritus et tandem in societatem in qua fuerunt cum vixerunt in corpore, ab angelis circumferuntur ad plures mansiones, quae sunt separatae societates, usque conjunctae 
cum aliis, et passim recipiuntur, passim inde ad alias; et hoc per aliquod tempus, usque dum ad societatem veniunt in qua fuerunt cum vixerant in corpore, et ibi manent; inde novum exordium 
vitae eorum: si simulator, hypocrita, aut dolosus, qui induere statum fallacem et genium quasi angelicum potest, a bonis spiritibus quandoque recipitur, sed post paucum tempus dissociatur, et tunc absque 
angelis circumvagatur, petitque ut recipiatur, sed rejicitur, et quandoque punitur; et tandem defertur inter infernales.  Qui e vastatione auferantur inter angelos, etiam variant societates, et cum 
inde transeunt ad alias, cum civilitate et charitate dimittuntur, et hoc usque dum veniunt in societatem angelicam quae concordat cum eorum charitatis, pietatis, probitatis, aut sincerae civilitatis, 
genio. Perductus etiam fui similiter per mansiones, et mecum locuti, ex causa ut scirem quomodo se habet; reflectere tunc dabatur super mutationes loci, quod solum apparentes essent, et quod non essent 
nisi mutationes status, corpore manente in eodem loco. </p>
