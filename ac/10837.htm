<h3 align="center" class="ired">属天的奥秘 第10837节</h3>
<h4 align="center"></h4><p><strong>10837</strong>.关于这个星球上居民之间的订婚和结婚，他们声称，适婚年龄的女子会待在家里，不可以外出，直到结婚那一天。然后，她被带到一个夫妻配对的房子里，其他许多准备结婚的年轻女子也被带到这里。在那里，她们被安置在一个齐腰的隔板后面，只露出她们的胸和脸。然后，年轻男子便来到这里选择一个妻子；当一个年轻男子看中与他相配的一位，并且吸引他的心智时，他就会牵着她的手。如果这个女子跟着他，他就把她带到为他们准备好的一个房间，她就成了他的妻子。在那个星球，人们只是看看别人的脸，就能判断他们是否心意相投，因为每个人的脸都是其心灵的标志；他们脸上没有丝毫伪装和欺骗。为确保一切都以一种得体、适当的方式进行，没有任何淫乱的意味，一位老翁坐在处女后面，一位老妇则坐在他们旁边，他们保持警戒。这样的地方有很多，年轻女子被带到那里供年轻男子选择；而且还有选择的指定时间。他们若在一个地方没有找到一个合适的年轻女子，就到另一个地方；若这次没有找到，就下一次再来。与我交谈的那些人还说，一个丈夫只能有一个妻子，从来没有多个妻子，因为这违反神性秩序。（第12卷结束，全书完）</p><br />

As regards betrothals and marriages among the inhabitants on that earth, they related that a daughter of marriageable age is kept at home, and is not allowed to go out until the day when she is to be 
married; and that she is then conducted to a certain wedding house, whither also have been brought a number of other young women who are marriageable; and they are there placed behind a partition that 
is raised as high as the middle part of their bodies, so that they are seen undressed merely in respect to the breast and face; and then the young men come thither to choose one for a wife; and when 
a young man sees one who is like himself, and to whom his mind draws him, he takes her by the hand; and if she then follows he leads her into a house that has been made ready, and she becomes his wife. 
For in that earth people see from the faces of others whether they agree in their minds, because there the face of everyone is the index of the mind, being quite free from pretence and deception. That 
all things may be done in a becoming manner, and without lasciviousness, an old man sits behind the virgin girls, and at their side an old woman, and they keep watch. There are a number of such places 
to which the young women are led, and there are also stated times when the young men may make their choice. For if they do not see a girl who suits them in one place, they go away to another; and 
if not at that time, they return at a subsequent time. They said further that a husband has only one wife, and never more, because this is contrary to Divine order. </p>

As regards betrothals and marriages among the inhabitants on that planet, they declared that a daughter of marriageable age is kept at home and not allowed to go out till the day on which she is to be 
married. She is then taken to a house where couples are paired off, to which a number of other young women ready for marriage have been brought. There they are placed behind a partition that comes up 
to the middle of their body, so that only the upper part of it and their face are exposed. Then young men come there to choose a wife; and when a young man sees someone compatible with himself, to whom 
his mind feels attracted, he takes her by the hand. If she then follows him he leads her to a house prepared for them, and she becomes his wife. For on that planet when people look at others' faces 
they can tell whether they are of a like mind, since everyone's face there is an indicator of his mind; there is no pretence or falsity in their faces. To ensure that everything is done in a proper 
way, without any lewdness, an old man sits behind the virgins, and an old woman to the side, who keep watch. There are many places such as this to which young women are taken to be chosen by young men; 
and there are also appointed times for this. For if a young man does not find a young woman who suits him in one place he goes to another; and if he does not see one then, he comes back on a subsequent 
occasion. Those to whom I was speaking also said that a husband has only one wife and never a number of them, since this is contrary to Divine order.  </p>

</p><b>10837.</b>
Quod desponsationes et conjugia apud incolas in illa tellure attinet, narrabant quod filia circa aetatem ejus nubilem teneatur domi, nec liceat ei exire usque ad diem quo maritanda; et quod tunc perducatur 
ad domum quandum connubialem, quo etiam plures aliae adolescentulae, quae nubiles, deductae sunt, ac ibi ponantur post tabulatum usque ad mediam corporis eorum partem elevatum; apparentes sic 
nudae modo quoad partem pectoralem et faciem; et quod tunc juvenes illuc veniant, ut sibi eligant aliquam in uxorem; et cum juvenis videt quandam sibi conformem, ad quam animus ejus illum trahit, manu 
illam prehendit; si illa tunc sequitur, ducit illam in domum praeparatam, et fit ejus uxor; ex faciebus enim ibi vident num animis conveniant, nam facies cujusvis ibi est index animi, nihil simulat et 
mentitur. Ut omnia decenter fiant et absque lascivia, post puellas virgines sedet vir senex, et ad latus mulier vetula, et observant. Talia loca sunt plura ad quae adolescentulae ducuntur, et quoque 
stata tempora, ut juvenibus sit electio; si enim non in uno loco puellam sibi convenientem vident, abeunt in alium, et si non eo tempore, sequenti redeant.  Porro dicebant quod maritus modo unam uxorem 
habeat et nusquam plures, quia hoc contra ordinem Divinum. </p>
