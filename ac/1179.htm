<h3 align="center" class="ired">属天的奥秘 第1179节</h3>
<h4 align="center"></h4><p><strong>1179.</strong>“所以俗语说，像宁录在耶和华面前是个猎取的勇士”表由于这么多人被说服，所以这类言辞成为俗语。另外，它还表这类宗教信仰很容易迷惑人们的心智。这从所有上述内容以及字义本身清楚可知。而且古时，人们给真实的事物取名，故这名字是给这类敬拜取的，也就是说，它用来说明表这类敬拜的“宁录”“是个猎取的勇士”，就是迷惑人们心智的那一类。经上之所以说“在耶和华面前”，是因为具有这类敬拜的人称分离之信为耶和华，或“一个人，耶和华”，这从前面有关该隐的论述（<a href="340.htm">340</a>节）明显可知，该隐同样表脱离仁之信。不过，“该隐”和“含”的区别在于，“该隐”存在于拥有直觉的属天教会中，而“含”存在于没有直觉的属灵教会中。因此，前者远比后者恶毒得多。古时，这种人被称为“勇士”，如以赛亚书：<br />基达的一切荣耀必归于无有，弓箭手所余剩的，就是基达人的勇士，必然稀少。（以赛亚书<a href="http://39-27.cn/赛21.16.htm">21:16</a>-<a href="http://39-27.cn/赛21.17.htm">17</a>）<br />何西阿书：<br />你们耕种的是奸恶，收割的是罪孽，吃的是谎话的果子，因你倚靠自己的行为，仰赖勇士众多。（何西阿书<a href="http://39-27.cn/何10.13.htm">10:13</a>）<br />还有其它经文。他们出于信称自己为“人”和“勇士”，因为原文中有一个特定的词用来表达“勇士”的概念，同时表达“人”的概念，在圣言中，它用来指称信，事实上具有双重含义。</p>

<p><strong>[NCE]1179.</strong> For this reason there was a saying: "Like Nimrod, mighty in hunting before the face of Jehovah," means that since so many people were swayed, this became a stock phrase; a further meaning is that this kind of religion ensnares people's minds very easily. This can be seen from the preceding remarks and from the literal meaning itself. Furthermore, since people in ancient times gave personal names to things, they assigned this name to that type of worship. To be specific, they said that Nimrod (that type of worship) was mighty in hunting (good at ensnaring people's minds). They added before the face of Jehovah because people whose worship was like this called a detached faith by the name Jehovah, or "the man Jehovah," as indicated by the remarks of <a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_1179/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_340" target=_top>340</a> above concerning Cain.<br />Cain too symbolizes faith detached from charity.<br />[2] But the difference between Cain and Ham is that Cain was part of the heavenly church, which had perception, while Ham was part of the spiritual church, which had no perception. So the earlier group was more culpable than the later.<br />In ancient times, people of this character were called mighty ones, as in Isaiah:<br />All the glory of Kedar will be consumed, and what is left of the number of bows among the mighty sons of Kedar will decrease. (<a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_1179/bible_king-james-version_isaiah_21_16-17" target=_top>Isaiah 21:16-17</a>)<br />And in Hosea:<br />You have plowed godlessness; wickedness you have reaped. You have eaten the fruit of your lying because you trusted your own way [and] the large number of your mighty ones. (<a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_1179/bible_king-james-version_hosea_10_13" target=_top>Hosea 10:13</a>)<br />There are other places too. They called themselves men and mighty ones on account of faith, because in the original [Hebrew] language there is a term simultaneously expressing the idea of a mighty one and a man,{*1} and in the Word, this term has to do with faith. It is faith in both senses that the term applies to.{*2} <br /><strong>Footnotes:</strong><br />{*1} The term that means both "a mighty one" and "a man" is גֶּבֶר (geḇer). [LHC]<br />{*2} "Both senses" are the positive and negative ones — true faith and corrupted faith. [LHC] </p>
<p align="center"><b>Potts(1905-1910) 1179</b></p><p><b>1179.</b>
Wherefore it was said, As Nimrod mighty in hunting before Jehovah. That this signifies that, because so many were persuaded, such a form of speech became proverbial and that it further signifies that 
such a religion easily captivates the minds of men, may be seen from all that has been said, and from the very sense of the letter. Moreover, as in ancient times they gave names to actual things, they 
gave this name to this worship, saying that "Nimrod"-that is, this worship-"was mighty in hunting," that is, was one that captivates the minds of men. It is said "before Jehovah," because they who were 
in such worship called faith separated "Jehovah," or "the man Jehovah," as is evident from what has been said before (n. 340) concerning Cain, by whom in like manner there is signified faith separated 
from charity. But the difference between "Cain" and "Ham" is that the former was in the celestial church which had perception, and the latter in the spiritual church which had no perception; and 
therefore the former was more heinous than the latter. In ancient times such were called "mighty," as in Isaiah: </p>
<p>     All the glory of Kedar shall be consumed, and the residue of the number, the bows 
of the mighty men of the sons of Kedar shall be diminished (Isa. 21:16-17). And in Hosea: </p>
<p>     Ye have plowed wickedness, ye have reaped iniquity, ye have eaten the fruit of a lie, for thou didst trust 
in thy way, in the multitude of thy mighty men (Hos. 10:13); </p>
<p>and in other places. They called themselves "men" [viri], and "mighty," from faith; for there is a term in the original language which 
expresses the idea of might and at the same time of a man [vir], which term in the Word is predicated of faith, and that in both senses. </p>

<p align="center"><b>Elliott(1983-1999) 1179</b></p><p><b>1179.</b>
'Therefore it used to be said, Like Nimrod, mighty in hunting before Jehovah' means that since so many were being persuaded this became a proverbial expression. In addition to this it means that such 
a religion easily captivates people's minds. This becomes clear from what has been stated and also from the actual sense of the letter. Moreover because in early times names were given to real things 
this name was given to this form of worship, that is to say, it used to be said that 'Nimrod', meaning that form of worship, was 'mighty in hunting', that is, was one that captivated people's minds. 
The reason for the words 'before Jehovah' is that people with whom that form of worship existed called separated faith 'Jehovah' or 'a man Jehovah', as is clear from what has been stated already about 
Cain in <a href="340.htm">340</a>, who likewise means faith separated from charity. The difference between Cain and Ham however lies in the fact that the former existed in the celestial Church which had perception, while 
the latter existed in the spiritual Church which had none. As a consequence the former was far more monstrous than the latter. In early times such people were called 'mighty', as in Isaiah, </p>
<blockquote>
All the 
glory of Kedar will be brought to an end, and the remainder of the number of the bows of the mighty men of the sons of Kedar will be diminished. <a href="http://bible.gospelcom.net/cgi-bin/bible?passage=Isa%2021:16,%2017&amp;version=ESV&amp;interface=print&amp;showfn=yes&amp;showxref">Isa 21:16, 17</a>. 
</blockquote>
<p>And in Hosea, </p>
<blockquote>
You have ploughed 
wickedness, you have reaped iniquity, you have eaten the fruit of lying, because you have trusted in your way, in the multitude of your mighty men. <a href="http://bible.gospelcom.net/cgi-bin/bible?passage=Hosea%2010:13&amp;version=ESV&amp;interface=print&amp;showfn=yes&amp;showxref">Hosea 10:13</a>. 
</blockquote>
<p>And in other places. They called themselves 
'men' (vir) and 'mighty' from faith, for one particular word in the original language expresses the idea of being 'mighty' and at the same time that of a man (vir), and it is used in the Word 
in reference to faith, and indeed in both senses. </p>

</p><b>1179.</b>
'Propterea dicebatur, Sicut Nimrod potens venatione coram Jehovah':  quod significet, quia tam multi persuadebantur, quod talis formula sollemnis facta, et quod porro significet quod talis religio facile 
animos hominum captet, constare potest ab illis quae dicta sunt, tum ab ipso sensu litterae; et praeterea, quia antiquitus nomina indebant rebus, hoc nomen indiderunt huic cultui, nempe quod {1}Nimrodus, 
hoc est, cultus hic, 'potens venatione,' hoc est, esset captans animos; quod 'coram Jehovah' est quia ii qui in tali cultu fuerunt, fidem separatam vocarunt Jehovam, seu virum Jehovam, ut constat 
ab illis quae dicta prius n. 340 de Caino, per quem similiter fides separata a charitate significatur; at differentia inter Cainum et Hamum est quod illud fuisset in Ecclesia caelesti quae perceptionem 
habuit, at hoc in Ecclesia spirituali quae nullam perceptionem habuit; quare illud enormius fuit quam hoc:  tales vocati sunt antiquitus 'potentes,' ut apud Esaiam, (x)Consummetur omnis gloria 
Kedaris, et residuum, numeri, arcus potentium filiorum Kedaris imminuentur, xxi [16] 17:   et apud Hosheam, Arastis impietatem, iniquitatem messuistis, comedistis fructum mendacii, quia confisus est 
viae tuae, multitudini potentium tuorum, x 13; </p>
<p>et alibi.  Viros et potentes se vocarunt ex fide, est enim in lingua originali {2}vox per quam exprimitur 'potens' et simul 'vir,' quae vox in Verbo 
praedicatur de fide, et quidem in utroque sensu. @1 Heb, (nimrod)='valiant, strong.'$ @2 Heb. (geber)=man, a strong one.  Potens in this verse translates the adjective from this noun.$ </p>
