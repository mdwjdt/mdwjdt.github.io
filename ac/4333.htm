<h3 align="center" class="ired">属天的奥秘 第4333节</h3>
<h4 align="center"></h4><p><strong>4333.</strong>从下面的解释明显可知这些话在内义上表示什么，也就是说，它们描述了旧教会正当废弃，新教会正当建立之时的状态如何。前面多次说明，旧教会的废弃和新教会的建立就是“世代的末了”、“人子降临”和总体上最后的审判所表示的。前面还说明，最后的审判在这个星球上已经发生过几次了：第一次发生在主的属天教会，也就是上古教会因邪恶与虚假的泛滥而在大洪水之前的人当中灭亡之时，“大洪水”在内义上就表示邪恶与虚假的这种泛滥。<br />第二次审判发生属灵教会自我毁灭之时，属灵教会存在于大洪水之后，被称为古教会，传播到亚洲大部分地区。<br />第三次发生在雅各后代当中教会的代表毁灭之时，这种毁灭则发生在十个支派被掳，永远囚禁，并分散到外邦人当中之时，最后发生在耶路撒冷被毁，犹太人也被驱散之时。由于主降临之后这个世代的末了或终结已经到来，因此主在福音书中所说关于那世代末了或终结的许多话也适用于犹太民族，同样适用于如今的许多人。然而，上述这些话所论述的主题具体、主要是即将到来的世代末了或终结（也就是<a href="1762.htm">1762</a>年），也就是约翰在启示录中所论述的基督教会的结束。这将是这个星球上的第四次最后审判。包含在上述36-41节经文中这些话的确切含义，可从它们的内义明显可知，其内义如下。</p>

What is signified by these words in the internal sense will appear from the following explication-that there is described what the state will be when the old church is being rejected and the new is being 
set up. That the rejection of the old church and the setting up of the new is what is meant by the "consummation of the age," and by the "coming of the Son of man," and in general by the Last Judgment, 
has been already repeatedly shown; and also that a Last Judgment has several times taken place on this globe: first, when the Lord's celestial church, which was the Most Ancient, perished in the 
antediluvians by an inundation of evils and falsities, which in the internal sense is the "flood." [2] Second, when the spiritual church, which was after the flood, and is called the Ancient, being 
spread over much of the Asiatic world, ceased of itself. [3] Third, when the representative of a church among the posterity of Jacob was destroyed, which took place when the ten tribes were carried 
away into perpetual captivity and dispersed among the nations; and finally when Jerusalem was destroyed, and the Jews also were dispersed. Because there was then a consummation of the age after the Lord's 
coming, therefore also many things said by the Lord in the Evangelists concerning the consummation of that age are also applicable to the Jewish nation, and are likewise applied to them by many at 
this day. Nevertheless the subject treated of in the above words is specifically and especially the consummation of the age now at hand,* namely, the end of the Christian Church, which is also treated 
of by John in Revelation. This will be the fourth Last Judgment on this globe. What the words involve that are contained in verses 36 to 42 adduced above, will appear from their internal sense, which 
is as follows. * That is, in the year 1762. </p>

What those words mean in the internal sense will be clear from the following explanation, namely that they describe what the state will be at the time when the old Church is set aside and the new is 
established. It has been shown many times already that the setting aside of the old Church and the establishment of the new is that which is meant by the close of the age and the coming of the Son of 
Man and in general by the last judgement. It has also been shown that a like judgement has occurred several times on this planet, the first taking place when the Lord's celestial Church, which was the 
Most Ancient, perished among those living before the flood through the deluge of evils and falsities meant in the internal sense by the flood. </p>
<p></p>
<p><b>[2]</b>
 The second judgement occurred when the spiritual 
Church, which existed after the Flood and is called the Ancient, and which was spread through much of the Asiatic world, reached a point when it had destroyed itself. </p>
<p></p>
<p><b>[3]</b>
 The third occurred when the 
representative of the Church among the descendants of Jacob was destroyed, a destruction which took place when the ten tribes were carried off into everlasting captivity and were scattered among the 
gentiles, and finally when Jerusalem was destroyed and the Jews too were dispersed. Because the close of that age was reached after the Lord's Coming, many of the Lord's statements in the Gospels about 
the close of that age are therefore applicable to that nation also; many at the present day do apply statements to it. But though these can be understood in that way, they refer specifically and primarily 
to the close of the age which is now imminent; that is to say, they refer to the end of the Christian Church, which is the subject also in John, in the Book of Revelation. This will be the fourth 
last judgement on this planet. Exactly what is implied by the words contained in verses 36-41 quoted above will be clear from the internal sense of them, which is this. </p>

Quid per illa verba significetur in sensu interno, constabit ab explicatione sequente, quod nempe describatur qualis status tunc futurus, cum Ecclesia vetus rejicitur et nova instauratur: quod rejectio 
Ecclesiae veteris et instauratio novae sit quod intelligitur per consummationem saeculi et per adventum Filii hominis et in genere per ultimum judicium, pluries prius ostensum est; tum quod 
ultimum illud judicium aliquoties exstiterit in hoc orbe terrarum, nempe PRIMO, cum Ecclesia caelestis Domini, (o)quae Antiquissima, in antediluvianis periit per mundationem malorum et falsorum, quae 
in sensu interno est diluvium: [2] SECUNDO, cum Ecclesia spiritualis, quae post diluvium, et Antiqua dicitur, per multum orbis Asiatici diffusa, ex se desiit: [3] TERTIO, cum repraesentativum Ecclesiae 
apud Jacobi posteros destructum, quod factum cum decem tribus in perpetuam captivitatem abductae sunt ac inter gentes sparsae; et denique cum Hierosolyma destructa, et Judaei etiam dispersi; 
quia tunc consummatio saeculi post adventum Domini fuit, ideo etiam plura {1} quae apud Evangelistas de consummatione illius saeculi a Domino dicta sunt, etiam ad illam gentem applicabilia sunt, 
et quoque a pluribus hodie applicantur; sed usque in specie et imprimis ibi agitur de consummatione saeculi quae nunc instat, nempe de fine Ecclesiae Christianae, de qua etiam apud Johannem in Apocalypsi 
agitur; haec erit QUARTUM ultimum judicium in hoc orbe terrarum.  Quid involvunt verba quae continentur in versibus 36-42 supra allegatis, constabit a sensu eorum interno qui talis est.
