<h3 align="center" class="ired">属天的奥秘 第2299节</h3>
<h4 align="center"></h4><p><strong>2299.</strong>小孩子主要通过适合其各种天性的表现形像受教，没人能想象出这些形像何等美丽，同时里面充满智慧。通过这种方式，他们逐渐被灌以从良善汲取其灵魂的聪明。在此我仅举一个曾被允许亲眼目睹的表现形像，好由此推断其它形像的性质。它们表现了主从坟墓里复活，同时其人性与神性合而为一。画面以十分智慧地方式呈现，完全超出所有人的智慧，同时又不失孩子的纯真。它们还表现出坟墓的概念，同时除了以极其遥远，以致几乎察觉不到那就是主的方式外，没有表现出主的概念。因为坟墓的概念有丧葬的意味，它们便以此方式消除这种意味。之后，有大气状、然而又似乎充满水汽的某种东西被极其小心地引入坟墓，以表示洗礼中的属灵生命，这同样是以适当遥远的距离来表现。然后，我看到主被表现为降到被捆绑的人那里，并与被捆绑的人一起升入天堂，该画面以无伦比的睿智和敬虔的方式呈现出来。这些表现形式适合孩子的特征，表现了主在低地被捆绑的人当中，有小小的绳索垂下来，几不可见，柔软纤细，支撑着主上升。整个过程充满神圣的敬畏，以免牵涉其中没有属灵属天成分的事物。还有其它吸引孩子的表现形式，比如适合孩子心智的游戏。通过这些游戏，他们被引入对真理的认知和对良善的情感中。</p>

Especially are the little children instructed by means of representatives adapted to their various genius; and how beautiful these are, and at the same time how full of wisdom from within, no one can 
possibly believe. In this way there is by degrees insinuated into them an intelligence that draws its soul from good. I may here mention one representative only that I was permitted to see, from which 
the nature of the rest may be inferred. They represented the Lord rising out of the sepulcher, and at the same time the unition of His Human with the Divine; which was done in a manner so wise as to 
surpass all human wisdom, and at the same time in an innocent infantile manner. They presented also the idea of a sepulcher, but not at the same time the idea of the Lord, except so remotely that it 
was scarcely perceived that it was the Lord, except as it were from afar; for the reason that in the idea of a sepulcher there is something funereal, which they thus removed. They afterwards in the most 
discreet manner admitted into the sepulcher something of an atmospherical nature, yet appearing thinly aqueous, by which they signified, also with becoming remoteness, spiritual life in baptism. I 
afterwards saw represented by them the Lord's descent to the bound, and His ascent with the bound into heaven; and this with incomparable sagacity and piety. A child-like feature of the representation 
was that when they represented the Lord among the bound in the lower earth, they let down cords that were almost invisible, and that were very soft and tender, with which to lift the Lord in His ascent; 
with a constant holy fear lest anything in the representative should touch upon something in which there was not what is spiritual celestial. Besides other representatives wherein the little ones 
are, and by which, as well as by sports of infancy adapted to their various dispositions, they are brought into knowledges of truth and affections of good. </p>

Young children are taught in particular by means of representatives suited to their disposition; and how beautiful these representatives are and at the same time how filled with wisdom from within. nobody 
can possibly believe. In this way intelligence which derives its soul from good is gradually instilled into them. Let merely one representative which I have been allowed to witness be recounted 
here, from which the nature of all others may be inferred. They represented the Lord rising up out of the tomb, and at the same time His Human united to the Divine. This was done in a manner so wise as 
to surpass all human wisdom, and yet at the same time in a manner that was innocent and that of a young child. They also presented the idea of a tomb, but not at the same time an idea of the Lord, except 
in so remote a way that one scarcely perceived it to be the Lord, except so to speak a long way off. The reason for this was that the idea of a tomb implies death and burial, which they were removing 
by their manner of presentation. After that, with utmost carefulness, they introduced into the tomb something air-like, yet seeming to be lightly filled with moisture, by which they meant, also 
with an appropriate remoteness, spiritual life in baptism. After that I saw them represent the Lord's descent to those that are bound and His ascent with those that are bound into heaven, which they did 
with matchless carefulness and reverence. And the representation had a child-like feature in that when they represented the Lord among the bound on the lower earth, they let down scarcely visible, 
soft and very slender cords with which they effected the Lord's ascent. All along they acted with a holy fear lest anything at all in the representation should border on anything devoid of the spiritual-celestial 
within it. There are other representatives besides these, such as games that are appropriate to the minds of young children by which they are introduced into cognitions of truth and into 
affections for good. </p>

Instruuntur infantes imprimis per repraesentativa geniis eorum adaequata, quae quam pulchra et simul sapientia ab interiore plena sint, nusquam aliquis credere potest; ita illis insinuatur per gradus 
intelligentia quae suam animam trahit a bono: unum solum repraesentativum quod videre datum, licet hic referre, ex quo concludi potest ad reliqua; repraesentabant Dominum e sepulcro ascendentem, (c)et 
simul Humani; Ipsius unitionem cum Divino quod fiebat modo tam sapiente ut excederet omnem sapientiam humanam et simul (o)modo innocente infantili; sistebant etiam' ideam sepulcri, sed non simul ideam 
Domini nisi ita remote ut vix perciperetur quod Dominus nisi quasi e longinquo, ex causa quia ideae sepulcri inest aliquid funeris, quod si removebant; postea admittebant prudentissime in sepulcrum 
quoddam atmosphaericum apparens usque ut tenue aqueum, quo significabant, etiam per remotionem decentem, vitam spiritualem in baptismo:  postea vidi repraesentari ab iis Domini descensum ad vinctos 
et ascensum cum vinctis in caelum, et hoc incomparabili prudentia et pietate; et quod infantile erat, cur repraesentarent Dominum apud vinctos in inferiore terra, funiculos fere inconspicuos, molliusculos 
et tenerrimos demittebant quibus Dominum allevarent in ascensu, semper in sancto timore ne quicquam in repraesentativo attingeret aliquid in quo non spirituale caeleste: praeter alia repraesentativa, 
in quibus sunt, et per quae in {1} cognitiones veri et affectiones boni, sicut per ludos infantum animis conformes, perducuntur. 	@1 ad.$ </p>
