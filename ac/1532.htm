<h3 align="center" class="ired">属天的奥秘 第1532节</h3>
<h4 align="center"></h4><p><strong>1532.</strong>在天堂，奇妙的事物会通过主的光出现，数量多到不计其数。除了其它具有属灵意义的事物外，诸如先知书和约翰在启示录中所提及的那些事物都是主及其国度的恒常代表。人无法用肉眼看到它们，但是，一旦内视或灵眼被主打开，这类事物就能被看见。先知的内视被打开时所看到的异象并非别的东西。如约翰所看到的金灯台（启示录<a href="http://39-27.cn/启1.12.htm">1:12</a>，<a href="http://39-27.cn/启1.13.htm">13</a>），如精金的圣城，它的光辉如极贵的宝石（启示录<a href="http://39-27.cn/启21.2.htm">21:2</a>，<a href="http://39-27.cn/启21.10.htm">10</a>，<a href="http://39-27.cn/启21.11.htm">11</a>），除此以外，先知书中还提及很多事物。人由此不仅可以知道天使生活在最明亮的光中，还能知道那里有无数事物，远远超过任何人的想像。</p><br />

<p><strong>[NCE]1532.</strong> Amazing sights can be seen by the Lord's light in heaven 钬?so many of them that they could never be listed. These sights consist of one scene after another representing the Lord and his kingdom, resembling scenes described by the prophets and by John in the Book of Revelation. There are other symbolic objects as well. We cannot possibly see them with our physical eyes, but as soon as the Lord opens our inner eyes 钬?the eyes of our spirit 钬?similar sights can immediately present themselves to view. The visions of the prophets were nothing more than the opening of their inner eyes. This is what happened when John saw the golden lampstands (<a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_1532/bible_king-james-version_revelation_1_12-13" target=_top>Revelation 1:12-13</a>), the holy city as pure gold, and its light source like a very precious stone (<a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_1532/bible_king-james-version_revelation_21_2" target=_top>Revelation 21:2</a>, <a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_1532/bible_king-james-version_revelation_21_10" target=_top>10</a>, [<a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_1532/bible_king-james-version_revelation_21_11" target=_top>11</a>, <a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_1532/bible_king-james-version_revelation_21_18" target=_top>18</a>]), not to mention much in the prophets. These considerations teach not only that angels live in the highest light but also that heaven contains countless marvels that no one could ever believe. </p>

Wonderful things appear in heaven from the Lord's light, things so beyond number that they could never be told. They are continual representatives of the Lord and of His kingdom, such as are mentioned 
in the Prophets, and by John in Revelation; besides other significatives. With the bodily eyes no man can possibly see them, but the moment the interior sight or that of the spirit is opened by the 
Lord, such things become visible. The visions of the prophets were nothing else than openings of their interior sight; as when John saw the golden lampstands (Rev. 1:12-13); and the Holy City as pure 
gold, with its luminary like to a stone most precious (Rev. 21:2, 10-11); besides many things mentioned in the Prophets; from which it may be known, not only that the angels live in the brightest light, 
but also that there are countless things there which surpass belief. </p>

From the Lord's light in heaven wonderful things appear, too numerous ever to be listed. There is a constant stream of representatives of the Lord and of His kingdom like those mentioned in the Prophets 
and in the Revelation to John, besides other things that carry a spiritual meaning. Man never can behold those things with the eyes of the body, but the moment anyone's interior sight, which is the 
sight of his spirit, is opened by the Lord, such things can be rendered visible. The visions of the prophets were nothing else than occasions when the interior sight was opened, as when John saw the 
golden lampstands, <a href="http://bible.gospelcom.net/cgi-bin/bible?passage=Rev%201:12,%2013&amp;version=ESV&amp;interface=print&amp;showfn=yes&amp;showxref">Rev 1:12, 13</a>, and the holy city as pure gold, and its light like a very precious stone, <a href="http://bible.gospelcom.net/cgi-bin/bible?passage=Rev%2021:2,%2010,%2011&amp;version=ESV&amp;interface=print&amp;showfn=yes&amp;showxref">Rev 21:2, 10, 11</a>, and more besides in the Prophets, from which one may know not only that 
angels live in supreme light but also that more things exist there than anyone can possibly believe. </p>

Ex luce Domini in caelo apparent mirabilia, et tam innumera ut nusquam possint edici; sunt repraesentativa continua Domini et Ipsius regni qualia apud Prophetas et apud Johannem in Apocalypsi, praeter 
significativa alia; homo nusquam oculis corporis illa videre potest, sed ilico dum a Domino aperitur alicui visus interior qui est visus ejus spiritus, similia possunt sisti videnda; visiones prophetarum 
non aliae fuerunt quam aperitiones visus eorum interioris, sicut quod Johannes vidit candelabra aurea, Apoc. i 12, 13; et civitatem sanctam ut purum aurum, et luminare illius simile lapidi pretiosissimo, 
Apoc. xxi 2, 10 [11]; praeter multa apud Prophetas, ex quibus sciri potest quod angeli non solum in summa luce vivant, sed (x)etiam quod indefinita ibi sint quae nusquam aliquis credere possit. </p>
