<h3 align="center" class="ired">属天的奥秘 第1410节</h3>
<h4 align="center"></h4><p><strong>1410.</strong>“耶和华对亚伯兰说”表对万事万物的最初意识。其含义如下：这个历史事件具有代表性，这些话本身具有属灵之义。古教会的风格就是这样，即若某事是真实的，他们就会说“耶和华说（say）”或“耶和华讲（speak）”，表示事情就是这样，如上所示。然而，后来具有属 灵之义的事物被转化为代表，这时，耶和华，即主就直接向他们说话。当此时经上说，耶和华说，或耶和华对某人说时，它的含义和前面一样。因为主的话在真实的历史中所包含的，和在虚构的历史中所包含的一样。唯一区别在于，后者被虚构成真实历史的样子，而前者则不是这样虚构的。所以，“耶和华对亚伯兰说”无非表最初的意识；如当古教会中有人通过良知，或某种其它指示，或他们的圣言意识到某事的确如此时，就会用“耶和华说”这样的表述。</p><br />

<p><strong>[NCE]1410.</strong> Jehovah said to Abram symbolizes a first realization. The situation is this: The recorded fact is representative, but the actual words are symbolic. The ancient church's method of expression was such that when a thing was true, they would say, "Jehovah said," or "Jehovah spoke," meaning that it was so, as shown before [搂搂<a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_1410/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_630" target=_top>630</a>, <a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_1410/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_708" target=_top>708</a>, <a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_1410/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_926" target=_top>926</a>, <a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_1410/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_1020" target=_top>1020</a>, <a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_1410/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_1037" target=_top>1037</a>].<br />After symbolism turned into representation, Jehovah (or the Lord) really did speak with people, and then when it says that Jehovah said something or that Jehovah spoke with someone, it has the same meaning as it did earlier.{*1} The Lord's words in the historical parts entail much the same thing that his words in the fictional parts do. The only difference is that the authors of the latter make up what seems to be a true story, while the authors of the former do not make it up.<br />This clause, then 钬?"Jehovah said to Abram" 钬?symbolizes nothing else than a first realization. In the ancient church, for instance, when people realized that a thing was so, because either conscience or some other inner voice or their Scriptures told them it was, they too said, "Jehovah said."<br /><br /><strong>Footnotes:</strong><br />{*1} For the meaning of "Jehovah said," see 搂<a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_1410/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_1020" target=_top>1020</a> with note 3 there.

Jehovah said unto Abram. That this signifies the first mental advertence of all, depends upon the fact that this historical is representative, and the words themselves significative. Such was the style 
in the Ancient Church, that when anything was true, they said "Jehovah said," or, "Jehovah spoke," which signified that it was so; as has been shown above. But after significatives had been turned 
into representatives, then Jehovah or the Lord did actually speak with men; and when it is then said that Jehovah said, or, Jehovah spoke with anyone, it signifies the same as before; for the Lord's words 
in the true historicals involve the same as His words in the made-up ones. There is only this difference, that the latter are composed to be like true history, and the former are not so composed. 
Wherefore that "Jehovah said unto Abram," signifies nothing else than the first mental advertence; as when in the Ancient Church anyone was admonished by conscience, or by some other dictate, or by their 
Word, that a thing was so, it was then said in like manner that "Jehovah said." </p>

<p align="center"><b>Elliott(1983-1999) 1410</b></p><p><b>1410.</b>
The implications of 'Jehovah said to Abram' meaning a first awareness of all things are as follows: The historical incident is representative, but the actual words describing it carry a spiritual meaning. 
Such was the style in the Ancient Church that if something was true people would say 'Jehovah said' or 'Jehovah spoke', which, as shown already, meant that it was so Subsequently however when things 
carrying a spiritual meaning were converted into representatives, Jehovah - that is, the Lord - at that point spoke to them directly. And when it is then said that 'Jehovah said' or 'Jehovah spoke' 
to somebody, it has the same meaning as previously, for the Lord's words in the true historical narratives embody within them the same as the Lord's words in the made-up ones. The only difference is 
that the latter contain that which has been made up to be like true narrative whereas the former have not been made up. 'Jehovah said to Abram' therefore means nothing other than a first awareness, 
as when in the Ancient Church someone through conscience, or through some other dictate, or through their Word, was made aware that something was so, the expression 'Jehovah said' would be used. </p>

</p><b>1410.</b>
'Dixit Jehovah ad Abramum': quod significet omnium primam animadvertentiam, ita se habet: historicum ibi est repraesentativum, at ipsa verba sunt significativa; in Ecclesia Antiqua talia stilus fuit, 
cum aliquid verum esset, quod dicerent, 'Jehovah dixit' vel 'Jehovah locutus,' quod significabat ita esse, ut ostensum prius postquam vero significativa versa sunt in repraesentativa, tunc Jehovah seu 
Dominus actualiter cum iis loquutus, et cum dicitur tunc quod dixit Jehovah seu locutus Jehovah cum aliquo, significat idem ac prius; nam verba Domini in historicis veris simile involvunt ac verba Domini 
in historicis factis; solum est differentia quod in his factum sit sicut historicum verum, in illis non factum: quare hoc quod dixit Jehovah ad Abramum non aliud significat, quam primam animadvertentiam; 
sicut cum in Antiqua Ecclesia aliquis animadvertebantur per conscientiam vel per dictamen aliud vel per Verbum eorum quod ita esset, tunc similiter dictum quod 'Jehovah dixit.' </p>
