<h3 align="center" class="ired">属天的奥秘 第5427节</h3>
<h4 align="center"></h4><p><strong>5427.</strong>“约瑟认得他哥哥们”表属灵层的属天层凭它的光看见教会的这些真理。这从“认得”和“他的哥哥们”的含义，以及“约瑟”的代表清楚可知：“认得”是指发觉、看见，因而是指看得见的；“约瑟”是指属灵层的属天层，如前所述；“他的哥哥们”是指教会的总体真理，如前所述（<a href="5409.htm">5409</a>，<a href="5419.htm">5419</a>节）。由于“约瑟认得他哥哥们”表示属灵层的属天层凭它的光看见教会的这些真理，故可知，它们通过属灵层的属天层所在的光，因而通过属灵层的属天层所拥有的光被看到。凭这光，也就是源于神性的真理（<a href="5417.htm">5417</a>节），在下面，也就是属世层里面的每一个真理都能看得见。但反过来不行，除非有一个属间物，尤其双方之间存在一致性，也就是能使双方联结起来的一致性。这一点从以下事实可以看出来：在天堂，因而在天堂之光中的天使能看到天堂正下方的灵人界里所发生的一切，以及低地或地狱里所发生的一切；但反过来不行。<br />同样的情形是：高层天堂的天使能看见他们下面的天堂里所发生的一切；但反过来不行，除非有一个居间物。居间灵人也充当来回交流的途径。因此，当在下面并且没有居间物的人，尤其那些与在他们之上的人没有一致性的人去看天堂之光时，他们完全一无所见；那里的一切在他们看来完全处于黑暗。而事实上，那个地方的人住在明亮的光中。这一点可通过下面这个独特经历来说明：曾有一座大城出现在我面前，那里有成千上万种不同的物体，都令人愉悦而美丽。我之所以看见它们，是因为我被赋予了一个居间物；但与我同在的灵人却连一个事物也看不见，因为他们没有居间物。我被告知，那些与在他们之上的人没有一致性的人，即便住在那座城中，也看不见那里的任何东西。<br />这也是内层人或人的灵，也就是所谓灵魂的情形。内层人能看见存在并发生于外层人中的每一件事；但反过来不行，除非双方处于一致，并且有一个居间物存在。所以，对外层人来说，当它没有处于与内层人的一致性时，内层人看似不存在。它看似完全不存在，以至于当谈论内层人时，在外层人看来，这种谈论要么如此晦涩，以致它不愿朝那个方向去思考，要么什么也不是，不可相信。但是，当二者之间存在一致性时，外层人在居间物的帮助下，就能看见发生在内层人里面的事。因为这时，内层人所拥有的光进入了外层人或属世人所拥有的光；也就是说，天堂之光进入了属世之光并光照它；在这更明亮的光中，发生在内层人中的事变得可见。这就是外层人所拥有的聪明和智慧的来源。不过，如果没有居间物，尤其没有一致性，内层人能看见并发觉外层人中所发生的事，并在某种程度上引导它；但反过来不行。然而，如果有对立物，也就是说，如果外层人完全败坏或扼杀了经由内层人所流入之物，那么内层人就会丧失它从天堂所得来的光，向上与天堂的交流就对它关闭；而来自地狱的交流则向外层人打开。你可在下文看到有关这些问题的详情。</p>

<p align="center"><b>Potts(1905-1910) 5427</b></p><p><b>5427.</b>
And Joseph knew his brethren. That this signifies that these truths of the church appeared to the celestial of the spiritual from its light, is evident from the signification of "knowing," as being to 
perceive, to see, and thus to appear; from the representation of Joseph, as being the celestial of the spiritual (of which above); and from the signification of "his brethren," as being the general 
truths of the church (of which also above, n. 5409, 5419). And because by "Joseph's knowing his brethren" is signified that the general truths of the church appeared to the celestial of the spiritual, 
it follows that they appeared from the light in which the celestial of the spiritual was, thus from the celestial light of the spiritual. From this light, which is truth from the Divine (n. 5417), appear 
all and each of the truths that are below, or that are in the natural; but not the converse unless there is an intermediate, still less unless there is correspondence and through correspondence conjunction. 
This may be seen from the fact that the angels who are in the heavens, and thus in the light of heaven, can see everything that is taking place in the world of spirits, which world is next 
beneath the heavens, and also everything that is taking place in the lower earth, and even in hell; but not the converse.  [2] It is also the case that the angels of a higher heaven can see all that 
is going on below them in a lower heaven; but not the converse, unless there is an intermediate. There are also intermediate spirits through whom the communication is effected to and fro. When therefore 
they who are below and have no intermediate, and still more if they have no correspondence, look into the light of heaven, they see nothing at all, but everything there appears in darkness; when yet 
they who are there are in the clearest day. This may be illustrated by this single experience. There appeared to me a great city in which were thousands upon thousands of various objects, all pleasing 
and beautiful. I saw them because an intermediate was given me, but the spirits who were with me, being without an intermediate, could not see the least thing there; and it was said that they who 
are not in correspondence, even if they are in the city, do not perceive a single thing therein. [3] Such also is the case with the interior man, or man's spirit, which is also called the soul, and which 
can see everything that exists and takes place in the exterior man; but not the converse, unless there is a correspondence and an intermediate. Consequently, to the exterior man not in correspondence 
the interior appears as nothing, so much so that when anything is said about the interior man, it appears to the exterior either so obscure that he is unwilling even to look in that direction, or 
else it appears as naught and not to be credited. But when there is correspondence, then the exterior man sees through an intermediate what is going on in the interior; for the light which the interior 
man has flows through the intermediate into the light which the exterior has, that is, heavenly light flows into natural light, and illumines it; from which illumining appears that which takes place 
in the interior man. Hence come intelligence and wisdom to the exterior or natural man. But if there is no intermediate, and especially if there is no correspondence, the interior man sees and perceives 
what is going on in the exterior, and in a measure leads it; but not the converse. If however there is contrariety, that is to say, if the exterior man entirely perverts or extinguishes what flows 
in through the interior, the interior man is then deprived of his light which is from heaven, and communication heavenward is closed to him; but communication from hell is opened toward the exterior 
man. On this subject more will be seen in what now follows. </p>

<p align="center"><b>Elliott(1983-1999) 5427</b></p><p><b>5427.</b>
'And Joseph recognized his brothers' means that the truths of the Church were visible to the celestial of the spiritual in the light that this possessed. This is clear from the meaning of 'recognizing' 
as perceiving, seeing, and so being visible; from the representation of 'Joseph' as the celestial of the spiritual, dealt with already; and from the meaning of 'his brothers' as the general truths 
known to the Church, dealt with above in <a href="5409.htm">5409</a>, <a href="5419.htm">5419</a>. And Since 'Joseph recognized his brothers' means that those truths - the general truths known to the Church - were visible to the celestial of the 
spiritual, it follows that they were seen by the light in which the celestial of the spiritual dwells and so by the light which the celestial of the spiritual possesses. In this light, which is truth 
from the Divine, <a href="5417.htm">5417</a>, every single truth below - that is, within the natural - is visible. But the reverse is not possible if no intermediary is present, still less if no agreement between the two sides 
exists, no agreement enabling the two to be joined together. This becomes quite clear from the consideration that angels dwelling in the heavens, and so in the light of heaven, can see every single 
thing that happens in the world of spirits, which is immediately below the heavens, as well as every single thing that happens on the earth of the lower ones, and indeed that happens in the hells. But 
the reverse is not possible. </p>
<p></p>
<p><b>[2]</b>
 It is also the case that the angels of a higher heaven can see everything that is happening in the heaven beneath them, but the reverse is not so unless an intermediary 
exists. Intermediary spirits also serve as the means by which communication forward and back takes place. When therefore those who are in a lower position and have no intermediary, and more particularly 
those who are not in agreement with the ones above them, look at the light of heaven, they see absolutely nothing at all; everything there appears to them to dwell in total obscurity. But in 
fact those in the place where they look dwell in the brightest light. This may be illustrated by the following unique experience: A large city once appeared in front of me, where there were thousands 
of different, delightful and beautiful sights. I saw these because an intermediary had been provided; yet the spirits present with me could not see a single thing because they had no intermediary. I 
was told that even though they are present in that place those who are not in agreement with the ones above them discern nothing whatever of the things existing there. </p>
<p></p>
<p><b>[3]</b>
 The same is similarly true 
of a person's interior man or spirit, which is also called his soul. The interior man can see every single thing present and taking place in the exterior man; but the reverse is not possible unless 
the two are in agreement and an intermediary is present. To the exterior man therefore, when it is not in agreement with the interior man, the interior man does not appear to have any existence. It appears 
to be so completely non-existent that when anything is said about the interior man, it seems to the exterior man either to be so obscure that it is unwilling even to contemplate it or to be nothing 
it can believe in. But when agreement between the two does exist, the exterior man sees, with the help of the intermediary, what is going on in the interior man. For then the light which the interior 
man possesses enters into the light which the exterior or natural man possesses; that is, heavenly light passes into natural light and brightens it, and in this brighter light what is happening to 
the interior man is made visible. This is the origin of the intelligence and wisdom which the exterior man possesses. But if no intermediary is present, and especially if no agreement exists, the interior 
man sees and perceives what is going on in the exterior man and also to some extent guides it; the reverse however does not happen. More than that, if contrariety exists - that is to say, if the 
exterior man completely perverts or snuffs out what comes in by way of the interior man - the interior man is deprived of the light it receives from heaven, heaven is inaccessible to it, and a communication 
from hell with the exterior man is opened up. You may see more about these matters in what now follows below. </p>

`Et agnovit Joseph fratres suos': quod significet quod vera illa Ecclesiae, caelesti spiritualis ex luce ejus apparerent, constat ex significatione `agnoscere' quod sit percipere, videre, ita apparere; 
ex repraesentatione `Josephi' quod sit caeleste spiritualis, de qua prius; et ex significatione `fratrum ejus' quod sint vera communia Ecclesiae, de qua supra n. 5409, 5419; et quia per `agnovit Joseph 
fratres suos' illa significantur, nempe quod vera communia Ecclesiae caelesti spiritualis apparerent, sequitur quod ex luce in qua caeleste spiritualis, ita ex luce caelesti spiritualis; ex hac 
luce quae est verum a Divino, n. 5417, apparent omnia et singula vera quae infra sunt, seu quae in naturali, non autem vicissim si non medium, {1} minus si non correspondentia, et per correspondentiam 
conjunctio; quod manifeste constare potest ex eo quod angeli qui in caelis, {2}ita in luce caeli, videre possint omnia et singula quae fiunt in mundo spirituum, qui mundus proxime infra caelos est, tum 
omnia et singula quae in terra inferiorum,  immo quae in infernis, non autem vicissim; [2]etiam ita se res habet quod angeli superioris caeli videre queant omnia quae fiunt sub illis in caelo inferiore, 
non autem vicissim nisi sit medium; sunt etiam spiritus medii per quos communicatio fit cis et retro; quapropter qui infra sunt, quibus non medium, et magis quibus non correspondentia, cum spectant 
in lucem caeli, nihil prorsus vident, apparet omne quod ibi, prorsus in obscuro; cum tamen illi qui ibi, in clarissima die sunt; {3}hoc illustrari potest unica hac experientia: apparuit mihi magna 
civitas, ubi mille et mille varia quae delectabilia et pulchra; vidi illa quia datum erat medium, at spiritus qui apud me erant, quid absque medio, ne minimum ibi videre potuerunt; et dictum quod qui 
non in correspondentia sunt, tametsi ibi, usque tamen ne hilum quod ibi, appercipiant. [3]Se quoque (t)hoc habet sicut interior homo seu spiritus ejus, qui etiam anima vocatur, ille videre potest omnia 
et singula quae sunt et fiunt in exteriore homine, non autem vicissim nisi sit correspondentia et medium; inde est quod exteriori homini qui non in correspondentia, appareat interior sicut nihil, usque 
adeo ut {4}dum aliquid de interiore homine dicitur, exteriori appareat vel ita obscurum ut ne quidem (t)visum illuc vertere velit, vel sicut nullum, cui non fides; at cum correspondentia est, tunc 
etiam exterior homo videt {5}per medium, quid {6}agitur in interiore; lux enim quae est interiori homini per medium influit in lucem quae est exteriori, hoc est, lux caelestis in lucem naturalem, et 
hanc illuminat, ex qua illuminatione apparet id quod apud interiorem hominem existit; inde intelligentia et sapientia exteriori seu naturali homini; at si non medium est, et magis si non correspondentia, 
tunc interior homo videt et percipit quid agitur in exteriore, et quodammodo etiam ducit, sed non vicissim; si {7}autem contrarietas {8}est, quod nempe exterior homo prorsus pervertat aut exstinguat 
quod influit per interiorem, tunc privatur interior homo sua luce {9} quae e caelo, et clauditur ei versus caelum, at aperitur communicatio ad exteriorem hominem ab inferno; plura de his videas in
