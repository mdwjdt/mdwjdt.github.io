THE INTERNAL SENSE.      Verses 1-4. And God said unto Jacob, Arise, go up to Bethel, and abide there; and make there an altar unto God who appeared unto thee when thou fleddest from before Esau thy 
brother. And Jacob said unto his household, and to all that were with him, Put away the gods of the stranger which are in the midst of you, and purify yourselves, and change your garments; and let us 
arise, and go up to Bethel, and I will make there an altar unto God who answered me in the day of my distress, and was with me in the way which I walked. And they gave unto Jacob all the gods of the 
stranger which were in their hand, and the earrings which were in their ears; and Jacob hid them under the oak which was by Shechem. "And God said unto Jacob," signifies the perception of natural good, 
such as Jacob now was, from the Divine; "arise, go up to Bethel," signifies concerning the Divine natural; "and abide there," signifies life; "and make there an altar unto God who appeared unto thee," 
signifies what is holy there; "when thou fleddest from before Esau thy brother," signifies when truth was set before good; "and Jacob said unto his household, and to all that were with him," signifies 
disposition in natural good, such as there was then; "put away the gods of the stranger which are in the midst of you," signifies that falsities should be rejected; "and purify yourselves and change 
your garments," signifies holiness to be put on; "and let us arise and go up to Bethel," signifies the Divine natural; "and I will make there an altar to God," signifies the holy in which interior 
things are terminated; "who answered me in the day of my distress," signifies in the state of the setting of truth before good; "and was with me in the way which I walked," signifies His Divine providence; 
"and they gave unto Jacob all the gods of the stranger which were in their hand," signifies that it rejected all falsities as much as possible; "and the earrings which were in their ears," signifies 
things actual; "and Jacob hid them under the oak which was by Shechem," signifies eternal rejection; "the oak by Shechem" denotes the fallacious natural. </p>

THE INTERNAL SENSE </p>
<p>Verses 1-4 And God said to Jacob, Rise up, go up to Bethel and settle there, and make there an altar to the God who appeared to you when you fled from before Esau your brother. 
And Jacob said to his household, and to all who were with him, Remove the gods of the foreigner which am in the midst of you, and be purified, and change your garments. And let us rise up and go up to 
Bethel, and I will make there an altar to the God who answered me on the day of my distress, and was with me in the way that I went.<A name="fntext1"></a><A href="#fn1"><sup>a</sup></a> And they gave to Jacob all the gods of the foreigner which were in 
their hand, and the jewels which were in their ears; and Jacob hid them under the oak which was by Shechem. </p>
<p>'God said to Jacob' means the perception which the kind of natural good that 'Jacob' now 
represents received from the Divine. 'Rise up, go up to Bethel' means concerning the Divine Natural. 'And settle there' means life. 'And make there an altar to the God who appeared to you' means that 
which is holy there 'When you fled from before Esau your brother' means when truth was placed above good. 'And Jacob said to his household, and to all who were with him' means the arrangement within 
the kind of natural good that existed at that point. 'Remove the gods of the foreigner which are in the midst of you' means that falsities were to be cast aside. 'And be purified, and change your garments' 
means the holiness that was to be put on. 'And let us rise up and go up to Bethel' means the Divine Natural. 'And I will make there an altar to the God' means the holiness by which interior things 
are enveloped. 'Who answered me on the day of my distress' means within the state in which truth is placed above good. 'And was with me in the way that I went' means His Divine Providence. 'And they 
gave to Jacob all the gods of the foreigner which were in their hand' means that [natural good] did, as far as possible, cast aside all falsities. 'And the jewels which were in their ears' means realized 
in actions. 'And Jacob hid them under the oak which was by Shechem' means an eternal casting away, 'the oak of Shechem' meaning the deceptive natural.

SENSUS INTERNUS </p>
<p>Vers. 1-4.  Et dixit Deus ad Jacobum, Surge, ascende Bethelem, et commorare {1} ibi, et fac ibi altare Deo viso ad te in fugiendo te a coram Esau fratre tuo.  Et dixit Jacob ad 
domum suam, et ad omnes qui cum illo, Removete deos alienigenae, qui in medio vestri, et purificemini et mutate vestes vestras.  Et surgamus, et ascendamus Bethelem, et faciam ibi altare Deo respondenti 
mihi in die angustiae meae, et fuit mecum in via quam ambulavi.  Et dederunt ad Jacobum omnes deos alienigenae, qui in manu illorum, et inaures quae in auribus illorum; et abscondidit illa Jacob 
sub quercu quae juxta Shechem. `Dixit Deus ad Jacobum' significat perceptionem naturalis boni, quale nunc Jacobus, ea Divino: `Surge, ascende Bethelem' significat de Naturali Divino: `et commorare 
{1} ibi' significat vitam: `et fac ibi altare Deo viso ad te' significat ibi sanctum: `in fugiendo te a coram Esavo fratre tuo' significat cum verum praelatum bono: `et dixit Jacob ad domum suam, et 
ad omnes qui cum illo' significat dispositionem in bono naturali, quali tunc: `Removete deos alienigenae qui in medio vestri' significat quod rejicerentur falsa: `et purificemini et mutate vestes 
vestras' significat sanctitatem induendam: `et surgamus et ascendamus Bethelem' significat Naturale Divinum: `et faciam ibi altare Deo' significat sanctum in quo interiora terminantur: `respondenti 
mihi in die angustiae meae' significat in statu praeferentiae veri prae bono: `et fuit mecum in via quam ambulavi' significat Divinam Ipsius Providentiam: `et dederunt ad Jacobum omnes deos 
alienigenae, qui in manu illorum' significat quod rejiceret omnia falsa quantum possibile: `et inaures quae in auribus illorum' significat actualia: `et abscondidit illa Jacob sub quercu quae juxta 
Shechem' significat rejectionem aeternum: </p>
<p>`quercus juxta Shechem' est naturale fallax.      @1 mane$ </p>
