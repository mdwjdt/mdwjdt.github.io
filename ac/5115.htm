<h3 align="center" class="ired">属天的奥秘 第5115节</h3>
<h4 align="center"></h4><p><strong>5115.</strong>“好像发了芽”表使重生得以实现的流注。这从“发了芽”或长叶，然后开花的含义清楚可知，“发了芽”或长叶，然后开花是重生的第一步。之所以表示流注，是因为当人正在重生时，属灵的生命就流入他，极像一棵树开始发芽时，通过太阳的热接受自己的生命。在圣言的各个地方，人的出生都被比作植物界的成员，尤其被比作树。如此作比的原因在于，整个植物界，以及动物界皆代表诸如存在于人里面的那类事物，因而代表诸如存在于主国度里面的那类事物。因为人是最小形式的天堂，这从各章末尾关于人与大人，也就是天堂的对应关系的说明可以看出来。这也解释了为何古人把人称作小宇宙；若对天上的状态知道得更多，他们还会称他为小天堂。因为整个自然界就是代表主国度的一个舞台（参看<a href="2758.htm">2758</a>，<a href="3483.htm">3483</a>，<a href="4939.htm">4939</a>节）。<br />但正在新生，也就是正在被主重生的人尤其被称为天堂；因为那时，来自主的神性良善与真理，因而天堂被植入他。事实上，正在重生的人就像一棵树，从一粒种子开始；这就是为何在圣言中，“种子”表示从良善所获得的真理。他也像一棵树那样长出叶子，然后开花，最后结果；因为他产出属于聪明的那类事物，这在圣言中以“叶子”来表示；然后产出属于智慧的那类事物，这以“开花”来表示；最后产出属于生活的那类事物，也就是行为上的爱与仁之良善，这在圣言中以“结果”来表示。这就是存在于一棵结出果实的树和一个正在重生的人之间的代表性的相似性，这种相似性如此之大，以至于只要对属灵的良善与真理有所了解，人就能凭一棵树获知重生的性质。由此可见，酒政所梦见的“葡萄树”以代表性的方式充分描述了就受理解力支配的感官能力而言，人重生的整个过程。该过程首先以三根枝子来描述，然后以发了芽、接着以开了花，后来以一挂一挂成熟的葡萄，最后以酒政把它们挤到法老的杯里，并递给他来描述。<br />此外，经由天堂从主流入的梦从来都是照着代表出现的，也就是说，从来不是别的东西，只是基于代表的场景。因此，凡不知道自然界中这样或那样的事物代表什么的人，尤其完全没有意识到自然界中的一切事物皆为代表的人，都不可避免地以为这些代表纯粹是诸如人人在日常用语所用的那种对比。它们的确是对比；但它们是诸如相对应，因而当处于内层天堂的天使在谈论属于主国度的属灵或属天事物时，在灵人界实际呈现为可见物体的那种。关于梦，可参看前文（<a href="1122.htm">1122</a>，<a href="1975.htm">1975</a>，<a href="1977.htm">1977</a>，<a href="1979.htm">1979</a>-<a href="1981.htm">1981</a>节）。</p>

And it was as though it budded. That this signifies the influx by which the rebirth is effected, is evident from the signification of "budding," or producing leaves and afterward blossoms, as being the 
first of rebirth. The reason why influx is signified is that when man is being reborn, spiritual life flows into him, exactly as when a tree is budding its life flows in through the heat from the sun. 
He who is born a man is in the Word occasionally compared to the subjects of the vegetable kingdom, especially to trees; and this because the whole vegetable kingdom, as well as the animal kingdom, 
represents such things as are in man, and consequently such as are in the Lord's kingdom; for man is a heaven in the least form, as is evident from what has been shown at the end of the chapters concerning 
the correspondence of man with the Grand Man, or heaven. Hence also the ancients called man a microcosm; and they might also have called him a little heaven had they known more about the state 
of heaven. (That universal nature is a theater representative of the Lord's kingdom, may be seen above, n. 2758, 3483, 4939.) [2] But it is especially the man who is being born anew, that is, who is 
being regenerated by the Lord, who is called a heaven; for he is then implanted in the Divine good and truth which are from the Lord, and consequently in heaven. For the man who is being reborn begins 
like a tree from seed (and therefore the truth which is from good is signified by "seed" in the Word); and also like a tree he produces leaves, then blossoms, and finally fruit; for he produces such 
things as are of intelligence, which in the Word are signified by "leaves," then such things as are of wisdom, which are signified by "blossoms," and finally such things as are of life, that is, the 
goods of love and charity in act, which in the Word are signified by "fruits." Such is the representative likeness between the fruit-bearing tree and the man who is being regenerated, insomuch that if 
anything is known about spiritual good and truth, the nature of regeneration may be learned from a tree. From this it is evident that by the "vine" in this dream is representatively described the full 
process of the rebirth of man as to the sensuous subject to the intellectual part; first by the three shoots, then by the budding, next by the blossoms, afterward by the ripening of the clusters into 
grapes, and finally by their being pressed into Pharaoh's cup and given to him. [3] Moreover the dreams which flow in through heaven from the Lord, never appear otherwise than according to representatives. 
He therefore who does not know what this or that thing in nature represents, and especially he who is quite unaware that anything is representative, cannot but believe that these representatives 
are merely comparisons, such as everyone uses in common speech. They indeed are comparisons, but such as correspond, and are therefore actually presented to view in the world of spirits, when the 
angels in an interior heaven are conversing about the spiritual and celestial things of the Lord's kingdom. (In regard to dreams, see above, n. 1122, 1975, 1977, 1979-1981.) </p>

'And it was as though budding' means an influx that allows rebirth to be effected. This is clear from the meaning of 'budding' - that is, bringing forth leaves, and also blossom later on - as the first 
stage of rebirth. The reason an influx is meant is that when a person is being born again spiritual life flows into him, even as a tree, when it starts to bud, is receiving its life through heat from 
the sun. The birth of a human being is compared in various places in the Word to members of the vegetable kingdom, especially trees. The reason for this comparison is that the entire vegetable kingdom, 
like the animal kingdom also, represents the kind of things that exist with the human being, and consequently the kind of things that exist in the Lord's kingdom. For the human being is heaven in 
its least form, as may be seen from what has been shown at the ends of chapters regarding correspondence of the human being with the Grand Man, which is heaven. This also explains why the ancients referred 
to man as the microcosm; and if more had been known about the heavenly state they would have called him a miniature heaven too. For the whole natural system is a theatre representative of the Lord's 
kingdom, see <a href="2758.htm">2758</a>, <a href="3483.htm">3483</a>, <a href="4939.htm">4939</a>. </p>

 But in particular it is a person who is being born anew, that is, being regenerated by the Lord, who is called heaven; for during that time Divine good and 
truth from the Lord, and consequently heaven, are implanted in him. Indeed, like a tree, a person who is being born again begins from a seed, which is why in the Word 'seed' means truth obtained from 
good. Also, like a tree, he brings forth leaves, then blossom, and finally fruit; for he brings forth the kind of things that belong to intelligence, which again in the Word are meant by 'leaves', then 
the kind of things that belong to wisdom, which are meant by 'blossoms', and finally the kind of things that are matters of life, namely forms of the good of love and charity expressed in action, which 
in the Word are meant by 'fruits'. Such is the representative likeness that exists between a fruitful tree and a person who is being regenerated, a likeness so great that one may learn from a tree 
about regeneration, provided that something is known first of all about spiritual good and truth. From this one may see that 'the vine' in the cupbearer's dream serves to describe fully in a representative 
fashion the process by which a person is born again so far as the sensory power subject to the understanding part is concerned. That process is described first by the three shoots, then by the 
buds that were formed, after that by the blossom, followed by the ripening of the clusters into grapes, and finally by his pressing them into Pharaoh's cup and his giving this to him. </p>

 Furthermore 
the dreams which come from the Lord by way of heaven are never anything else than scenes based on representatives. Anyone therefore who does not know what this or that in the natural world represents, 
more so one who is totally unaware of anything at all being representative there, inevitably supposes that those representatives are merely comparisons such as anybody may use in ordinary conversation. 
They are indeed comparisons; but they are the kind which are also correspondences and which therefore present themselves as visible objects in the world of spirits while the angels positioned more 
internally in heaven are talking about spiritual or celestial things belonging to the Lord's kingdom. Regarding dreams, see <a href="1122.htm">1122</a>, <a href="1975.htm">1975</a>, <a href="1977.htm">1977</a>, <a href="1979.htm">1979</a>-<a href="1981.htm">1981</a>. </p>

`Et illa sicut germinans': quod significet influxum per quem renascentia, constat ex significatione `germinare', seu producere folia ut postea florem, quod sit primum renascentiae; quod sit influxus, 
est quia cum renascitur homo, influit vita spiritualis in illum, sicut cum arbor germinat, ejus vita per calorem a sole.  Homo qui nascitur, in Verbo passim comparatur subjectis regni vegetabilis, 
imprimis arboribus, et hoc quia totum regnum vegetabile sicut etiam regnum animale, repraesentat talia quae apud hominem, consequenter quae in regno Domini; homo enim est caelum in minima forma, 
ut constare potest ab illis quae ad finem capitum de correspondentia hominis cum Maximo Homine seu caelo, ostensa sunt; </p>
<p>inde quoque antiqui hominem appellaverunt microcosmum; vocavissent etiam exiguum 
caelum, si de statu caeli plura novissent; quod universa natura sit theatrum repraesentativum regni Domini, videatur n. 2758, 3483, 4939; sed imprimis est homo qui nascitur e novo, hoc est, qui 
regeneratur a Domino, qui vocatur caelum, tunc enim implantatur bono et vero Divino quod a Domino, consequenter caelo; homo enim qui renascitur, similiter ac arbor, a semine incipit, quapropter 
per `semen' in Verbo significatur verum quod a bono, tum similiter ac arbor producit folia, dein florem, et denique fructum; producit enim talia quae sunt intelligentiae, quae quoque in Verbo significantur 
per `folia', dein talia quae sunt sapientiae; haec sunt quae significantur per `flores'; et denique talia quae sunt vitae, nempe bona amoris et charitatis actu, quae in Verbo significantur 
per `fructus'; talis similitudo repraesentativa est inter arborem frugiferam et inter hominem qui regeneratur, adeo ut ex arbore disci queat quomodo se cum regeneratione habet, modo aliquid de bono 
et vero spirituali prius sciatur: inde constare potest quod in (t)hoc somnio per `vitem' repraesentative describatur plene processus renascentiae hominis quoad sensuale intellectuali subjectum per 
`tres propagines', tum per `germinationem' dein postea per `maturationem botrorum in uvas', denique expresserit illas in scyphum pharaonis, et dederit ei'.  [3] Somnia quae influunt per caelum a 
Domino, nusquam aliter apparent quam secundum repraesentativa; qui itaque non scit quid hoc aut illud in natura repraesentat, et minus qui quod aliquid repraesentet, is non aliter credere prorsus non 
scit quid hoc aut scit quod aliquid repraesentet, is non aliter credere potest quam quod solum comparationes sint, quales unicuique in communi loquela; sunt etiam comparationes sed tales quae correspondent 
et quae inde actualiter sistuntur in mundo spirituum, quando apud angelos qui in interiore caelo sunt, est loquela de spiritualibus et caelestibus regni Domini; de somniis videantur n. 1122,
