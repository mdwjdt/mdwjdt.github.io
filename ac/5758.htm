<h3 align="center" class="ired">属天的奥秘 第5758节</h3>
<h4 align="center"></h4><p><strong>5758.</strong>“我们怎能从你主人家里偷窃金银呢”表为何我们声称来自神性属天层的真理与良善属于自己呢。这从“偷窃”、“银”和“金”的含义清楚可知：“偷窃”在灵义上是指声称主的东西属于自己，如前所述（<a href="5749.htm">5749</a>节）；“银”是指真理（<a href="1551.htm">1551</a>，<a href="2954.htm">2954</a>，<a href="5658.htm">5658</a>节）；“金”是指良善（<a href="113.htm">113</a>，<a href="1551.htm">1551</a>，<a href="1552.htm">1552</a>，<a href="5658.htm">5658</a>节）。整个这一章论述了属灵的偷窃，属灵的偷窃就在于声称来自主的良善与真理属于自己。这是一个极其重大的事件，以致人死后无法被准许进入天堂，直到他从心里承认良善或真理丝毫不源于他自己，只源于主；凡源于他自己的，无非是邪恶。这一事实通过许多经历向死后之人证明了。天上的天使清楚发觉一切良善与真理皆来自主。另外，他们还发觉主就是那拦阻他们远离邪恶，将他们保守在良善，因而保守在真理中的那一位，祂以大能成就此事。<br />多年来，我也蒙允许明显察觉这一点；还发觉我被留在自我到何等程度，就被邪恶淹没到何等程度；但被主拦阻远离这邪恶到何等程度，就从邪恶被提升至良善到何等程度。因此，声称真理和良善属于自己与在天堂普遍掌权的心态是对立的，与承认一切救恩都是由于怜悯，也就是说，人凭自己便在地狱，而是主因其怜悯而将他从地狱拖出来是对立的。人也无法谦卑下来，进而领受主的怜悯（因为这怜悯只流入有谦卑的地方，也就是流入谦卑的心），除非他承认他凭自己只会制造邪恶，一切良善皆来自主，主是一切良善的源头。没有这种承认，人会将凡他所行的当作功德，最终当作公义归于自己；因为声称来自主的真理与良善属于自己就是自我公义，自我公义是许多邪恶的源头；因为如此思想的人在他为邻舍所行的一切事上都关注自我；当他如此行时，便爱自己超过其他所有人，因而蔑视他们；虽然他没有在言语上表达出来，这种蔑视却在他心里。</p>

And how should we steal out of thy lord's house silver or gold? That this signifies why then shall we claim to ourselves truth and good, which are from the Divine celestial, is evident from the signification 
of "stealing," as being in the spiritual sense to claim to oneself that which belongs to the Lord (of which above, n. 5749); from the signification of "silver," as being truth (n. 1551, 2954, 
5658); and from the signification of "gold," as being good (n. 113, 1551, 1552, 5658). In this whole chapter spiritual theft is treated of, which is the claiming to oneself of the good and truth that 
are from the Lord. This is a matter of so great moment that a man after death cannot be admitted into heaven until he acknowledges at heart that nothing of good or truth is from himself, but all from 
the Lord, and that whatever is from himself is nothing but evil. The fact that this is so, is shown to man after death by many experiences. The angels in heaven plainly perceive that all good and truth 
are from the Lord; and moreover that by the Lord they are withheld from evil and kept in good and so in truth, and this by a mighty force. [2] It has been given me plainly to perceive this now for 
many years, and also that insofar as I have been left to my own or to myself, I have been inundated with evils, and so far as I have been withheld therefrom by the Lord, I have been lifted up from evil 
into good. Therefore to claim truth and good to oneself is contrary to the universal that reigns in heaven, as well as contrary to the acknowledgment that all salvation is of mercy, that is, that man 
of himself is in hell, but is of mercy drawn out thence by the Lord. Man cannot be in humiliation, nor consequently can he receive the Lord's mercy (for this flows in only in humiliation or into a 
humble heart), unless he acknowledges that there is nothing but evil from himself, and that all good is from the Lord. Without this acknowledgment a man attributes to himself as merit, and at length as 
righteousness, whatever he does; for to claim to himself the truth and good which are from the Lord is to make himself righteous. This is the source of many evils; for he then regards self in everything 
that he does for the neighbor, and when he does this he loves himself above all others, whom he then despises, if not in word, yet in heart. </p>

'And how could we steal from your lord's house silver or gold? means, Why should we lay claim to truth or good that comes from the Divine celestial? This is clear from the meaning of 'stealing' in the 
spiritual sense as laying claim to what is the Lord's, dealt with above in <a href="5749.htm">5749</a>; from the meaning of 'silver' as truth, dealt with in <a href="1551.htm">1551</a>, <a href="2954.htm">2954</a>, <a href="5658.htm">5658</a>; and from the meaning of 'gold' as good, dealt 
with in <a href="113.htm">113</a>, <a href="1551.htm">1551</a>, <a href="1552.htm">1552</a>, <a href="5658.htm">5658</a>. The whole of this chapter has as its subject spiritual theft, which consists in laying claim to good and truth that come from the Lord. This is a matter of consequence so 
great that after death a person cannot be admitted into heaven until he acknowledges in his heart that nothing good or true originates in himself, only in the Lord, and that whatever does originate 
in himself is nothing but evil. The truth of this is proved to a person after death by means of many experiences. The angels in heaven perceive quite clearly that everything good and true comes from the 
Lord, in addition they perceive that the Lord is the one who withholds them from evil and maintains in them what is good and therefore what is true, which He does with great force. </p>

<p><b>[2]</b>
 I too have 
been allowed to perceive the same things quite plainly for many years now, and also to perceive that to the extent that I have been left to my proprium or on my own I have been swamped by evils, but 
to the extent that I have been withheld from this by the Lord I have been raised from evil to good. Laying claim therefore to truth or good as one's own is the opposite of the attitude of mind that 
reigns universally in heaven. It is also the opposite of the acknowledgement that all salvation is due to mercy, that is, that a person left to himself is in hell, but the Lord in His mercy pulls him 
out of there. Nor can a person have humility or consequently accept the Lord's mercy - for mercy can enter only where there is humility, that is, into a humble heart - unless he acknowledges that left 
to himself he produces nothing but evil and that the Lord is the source of all good. Moreover he otherwise thinks that the deeds he performs earn him merit and eventually righteousness; for to claim 
as one's own truth and good which come from the Lord is self-righteousness, from which many evils well up. Thinking in that way a person sees himself in every specific deed he performs for his neighbour; 
and when he does this he loves himself more than everyone else, whom he thus holds in contempt which, though he may not express it verbally, is nevertheless present in his heart. </p>

`Et quomodo furabimur ex domo domini tui argentum  vel aurum ?':  quod significet cur tunc vindicabimus nobis verum et bonum quod a caelesti Divino, constat a significatione `furari' quod in sensu spirituali 
sit vindicare sibi quod Domini est, de qua supra n. 5749; ex significatione `argenti' quod sit verum, de qua n. 1551, 2954, 5658; et ex significatione `auri' quod sit bonum, de qua n. 113, 1551, 
1552, 5658.  In toto hoc capite agitur de furto spirituali, quod est vindicare sibi bonum et verum quod a Domino; hoc tanti momenti est ut homo post mortem non admitti queat in caelum priusquam corde 
agnoscit quod nihil (t)boni et veri sit a se sed a Domino, et quod quicquid a se, non sit nisi malum; quod ita sit, ostenditur homini post mortem per plures experientias; quod omne `bonum et verum' 
sit a Domino, percipiunt angeli in caelo manifeste, et insuper quod a Domino detineantur a malo et teneantur in bono et inde vero, et hoc vi forti; [2] hoc etiam mihi datum est percipere evidenter 
nunc per plures annos, et quoque quantum relictus sum proprio seu mihi, quod tantum inundatus sim malis, {1}et quantum inde detentus a Domino, tantum a malo in bonum elevatus (x)sim; quapropter sibi vindicare 
verum et bonum est contra universale regnans in caelo, tum contra agnitionem quod ex misericordia omnis salus, hoc est, quod homo ex se in inferno sit, sed a Domino ex misericordia inde trahatur; 
(m){2}nec homo potest esse in humiliatione,  consequenter non recipere misericordiam Domini, nam haec in humiliatione seu in humile cor solum influit, nisi agnoscat quod a  se nihil nisi malum, et 
quod a Domino omne bonum; praeter quod {3}alioquin sibi pro merito tribuat quae facit, et denique pro justitia, nam vindicare sibi verum et bonum quod a Domino, est justificare seipsum ;(n) inde scaturigo 
plurium malorum, spectat tunc semet in singulis quae facit proximo, et cum hoc facit, amat se prae omnibus aliis quos sic contemnit, si non ore usque corde. @1 at$ @2 et quamdiu homo vindicat 
sibi bonum et verum tamdiu non$ @3 sic$ </p>
