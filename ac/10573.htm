<h4 align="center"></h4><p><strong>10573</strong>.出埃及记33:18-23.摩西说，求你使我看见你的荣耀。祂说，我要使我的一切美善都在你面前经过，并要在你面前宣告耶和华的名；我要恩待谁，就恩待谁；要怜悯谁，就怜悯谁。又说，你不能看见我的面，因为没有人看见我还可以存活。耶和华说，看哪，我这里有个地方，你要站在磐石上。我的荣耀经过的时候，我必将你放在磐石缝里，用我的手掌遮掩你，等我过去。然后我要将我的手掌收回，你就得见我的背，却不得见我的面。<br />“摩西说，求你使我看见你的荣耀”表在外在层面上对里面的神性真理的洞察。“祂说，我要使我的一切美善都在你面前经过”表使构成天堂和教会的一切神性都从与内在分离的外在（就是与摩西和他所领导的民族同在的外在）经过。“并要在你面前宣告耶和华的名”表那里的神性敬拜的神圣。“我要恩待谁，就恩待谁；要怜悯谁，就怜悯谁”表神性真理和良善将被揭示给那些乐于接受的人。“又说，你不能看见我的面”表教会、敬拜和圣言的内层神性事物不能向以色列民族透露。“因为没有人看见我还可以存活”表神性本身的本质只有通过天堂里的主才能被看到。“耶和华说，看哪，我这里有个地方，你要站在磐石上”表一种信仰神的状态。“我的荣耀经过的时候”表圣言、教会和敬拜的内层事物。“我必将你放在磐石缝里”表诸如与那些兴趣在于外在事物，不在于内在之物的人同在的那种信的模糊和虚假。“用我的手掌遮掩你，等我过去”表内在之物的关闭。“然后我要将我的手掌收回，你就得见我的背，却不得见我的面”表他们将看见圣言、教会和敬拜的外在事物，却看不见内在事物。</p>

Verses 18-23. And he said, Make me see I pray Thy glory. And He said, I will make all My good pass by over thy faces, and will call on the name of Jehovah before thee; and I will show grace to whom I 
show grace, and I will show mercy to whom I show mercy; and He said, Thou canst not see My faces, because a man doth not see Me and live. And Jehovah said, Behold a place with Me, and thou shalt stand 
upon the rock; and it shall be when My glory passeth by that I will put thee in a cleft of the rock, and will cover the palm of My hand over thee until I have passed by. And I will remove the palm of 
My hand, and thou shalt see My back parts; and My faces shall not be seen. "And he said, Make me see I pray Thy glory" signifies the noticing of internal Divine truth in the external; "and He said, 
I will make all My good pass by over thy faces" signifies all the Divine of heaven and of the church above the external separate from the internal; "and will call on the name of Jehovah before thee" signifies 
what is holy of Divine worship there; "and I will show grace to whom I show grace, and I will show mercy to whom I show mercy" signifies that Divine truth and good shall be revealed to those 
who receive; "and He said, thou canst not see My faces" signifies that the interior Divine things of the church, of worship, and of the Word cannot appear to the Israelitish nation; "because a man doth 
not see Me and live" signifies that the Divine Itself cannot be seen such as it is in Itself, but such as it is through the Lord in heaven; "and Jehovah said, Behold a place with Me, and thou shalt 
stand upon the rock" signifies a state of faith in God; "and it shall be when My glory passeth by" signifies the interior things of the Word, of the church, and of worship; "that I will put thee in a 
cleft of the rock" signifies the obscurity and falsity of faith such as are with those who are in external things without what is internal; "and will cover the palm of My hand over thee until I have passed 
by" signifies the closing of the internal; "and I will remove the palm of My hand, and thou shalt see My back parts, and My faces shall not be seen" signifies that they should see the external things 
of the Word, of the church, and of worship, but not the internal things. </p>

Verses 18-23  And he said, Cause me, I beg You, to see Your glory. And He said, I will cause all My goodness to pass by<A name="fntext1"></a><A href="#fn1"><sup>a</sup></a> your face, and I will proclaim the name of Jehovah before you; and I will be gracious 
to whom I am gracious, and I will show mercy to whom I show mercy. And He said, You cannot see My face, for no one will see Me and live<A name="fntext2"></a><A href="#fn2"><sup>b</sup></a>. And Jehovah said, Behold, there is a place by Me, and 
you shall stand on the rock. And so it will be, as My glory passes through, that I will put you in a cleft of the rock and cover My palm over you until I have passed through. And I will take My palm 
away, and you will see My back parts; and My face will not be seen. </p>
<p>'And he said, Cause me, I beg You, to see Your glory' means discernment on the external level of Divine Truth within. 'And He said, 
I will cause all My goodness to pass by your face' means causing everything Divine which composes heaven and the Church to pass by the external [separated from the internal as it existed with Moses 
and the nation he headed]. 'And I will proclaim the name of Jehovah before you' means the holiness of the Divine worship there. 'And I will be gracious to whom I am gracious, and I will show mercy to 
whom I show mercy' means that Divine Truth and Good will be revealed to those who are receptive. 'And He said, You cannot see My face' means that things which are interior and Divine in the Church, worship, 
and the Word cannot be revealed to the Israelite nation. 'For no one will see Me and live' means that the essential nature of the Divine Himself can be seen only through the Lord in heaven. 'And 
Jehovah said, Behold, there is a place by Me, and you shall stand on the rock' means a state of faith in God. 'And so it will be, as My glory passes through' means the interior things of the Word, 
the Church, and worship. 'That I will put you in a cleft of the rock' means obscurity and falsity of faith such as exists with those whose interest lies in external things and not in what is internal. 
'And cover My palm over you until I have passed through' means shutting off what is internal. 'And I will take My palm away, and you will see My back parts; and My face will not be seen' means that they 
would see the external things of the Word, the Church, and worship, but not the internal.

Vers. 18-23. Et dixit, Fac videre mihi quaeso gloriam Tuam. Et dixit, Ego pertransire faciam omne bonum Meum super facies tuas, et invocabo nomen Jehovae coram te, et gratiam faciam cui gratiam facio, 
et misericordiam faciam cui misericordiam facio. Et dixit, Non potes videre facies Meas, quia non videt Me homo et vivit. Et dixit Jehovah Ecce locus Mecum, et stabis super petra. Et erit, in pertransire 
gloria Meam, et ponam te in fissura petrae, et obtegam volam Meam super te usque dum pertransivero. Et removebo volam Meam, et videbis posteriora Mea, et facies Meae non videbuntur. `Et dixit, 
Fac videre mihi quaeso gloriam Tuam' significat apperceptionem Divini Veri interni in externo `et dixit, Ego pertransire faciam omne bonum Meum super facies tuas, significat omne Divinum caeli et Ecclesiae 
super externum [separatur ab interno, in quo Moscheh et gens cui praeerat]: `et invocabo nomen Jehovae coram te' significat sanctum cultus Divini ibi: `et gratiam faciam cui gratiam facio, et misericordiam 
faciam cui misericordiam facio' significat quod Divinum Verum et Bonum revelabitur illis qui recipiunt `et dixit, Non potes videre facies Meas' significat quod Divina interior Ecclesiae, cultus, 
et Verbi non apparere possint genti Israeliticae: `quia non videt Me homo et vivit significat quod ipsum Divinum non videri possit quale in Se est, sed quale per Dominum in caelo: `et dixit Jehovah 
Ecce locus Mecum, et stabis super petra' significat statum fidei in Deum `et erit in pertransire gloriam Meam' significat interiora Verbi, Ecclesiae et cultus: `et ponam te in fissura petrae' significat 
obscurum et falsum fidei, quale illis qui in externis absque interno sunt: `et obtegam volam Meam super te, usque dum pertransivero' significat occlusionem interni et removebo volam Meam, et videbis 
posteriora Mea, et facies Meae non videbuntur' significat quod externa Verbi, Ecclesiae, et cultus visuri, non autem interna. </p>
