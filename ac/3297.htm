<h4 align="center"></h4><p><strong>3297.</strong>创世记25:24-26.她的日子满了，要生产，看哪，腹中果然是双子。先出来的浑身发红，像毛衣，他们就给他起名叫以扫。随后他的兄弟也出来了，他的手抓住以扫的脚跟，他就给他起名叫雅各；利百加生下他们的时候，以撒年正六十岁。<br />“她的日子满了，要生产”表效果的第一个状态。“看哪，腹中果然是双子”表这二者同时成孕。“先出来的浑身发红，像毛衣”表构成属世真理生命的良善。“他们就给他起名叫以扫”表它的本质。“随后他的兄弟也出来了”表真理。“他的手抓住以扫的脚跟”表属世人的良善的最低层，真理以某种能力附着于它。“他就给他起名叫雅各”表属世真理的教义。“利百加生下他们的时候，以撒年正六十岁”表那时神圣理性的状态。</p>

Verses 24-26. And her days were fulfilled to bring forth, and behold twins were in her womb. And the first came forth red all over like a hairy garment, and they called his name Esau. And after that 
came forth his brother, and his hand laid hold on Esau's heel, and he called his name Jacob: and Isaac was a son of sixty years when she bare them. "And her days were fulfilled to bring forth," signifies 
the first state of the effect; "and behold twins were in her womb," signifies that both were conceived together; "and the first came forth red all over like a hairy garment," signifies the natural 
good of the life of truth; "and they called his name Esau," signifies its quality; "and after that came forth his brother," signifies truth; "and his hand laid hold on Esau's heel," signifies the lowest 
of the good of the natural, to which it adhered with some power; "and he called his name Jacob," signifies the doctrine of truth of the natural; "and Isaac was a son of sixty years when she bare them," 
signifies the state of the Divine rational at that time. </p>

Verses 24-26 And her days for bringing forth were completed, and behold, there were twins in her womb. And the first came out, ruddy all over, like a hairy garment; and they called his name Esau. And 
after that his brother came out, and his hand was grasping Esau's heel; and he called his name Jacob. And Isaac was a son of sixty years when she bore them. </p>
<p>'Her days for bringing forth were completed' 
means the first state of the effect. 'And behold, there were twins in her womb' means that the two were conceived simultaneously. 'And the first came out, ruddy all over, like a hairy garment' means 
good constituting the life of natural truth. 'And they called his name Esau' means its essential nature. 'And after that his brother came out' means truth. 'And his hand was grasping Esau's heel' 
means the lowest level of natural good, to which [truth] clung with some power. 'And he called his name Jacob' means the doctrine of natural truth. 'And Isaac was a son of sixty years when she bore them' 
means the state of Rational Truth at that time. </p>

Vers. 24-26. Et impleti sunt dies ejus ad pariendum, et ecce gemini in utero ejus. Et exivit primus rufus totus is, sicut tunica pilosa, et vocabant nomen ejus Esau. Et post ita, exivit frater ejus, 
et manus ejus prehendens in calcaneum Esavi, et vocabat nomen ejus Jacob. Et Jishak filius sexaginta annorum in pariendo illos. `Impleti sunt dies ejus ad pariendum' significat statum primum effectus: 
`et ecce gemini in utero ejus' significat quod utramque simul conceptum: `et exivit primus rufus totus is, sicut tunica pilosa' significat bonum vitae veri {1}naturalis: `et vocabant nomen ejus Esau' 
significat quale ejus: `et post ita, exivit frater ejus' significat verum: `et manus ejus prehendens in calcaneum Esavi' significat infimum boni naturalis, cui adhaerebat aliqua potentia: `et vocabat 
nomen ejus Jacob' significat doctrinam veri naturalis: `et Jishak filius sexaginta annorum in pariendo illos' significat Divini Rationalis statum tunc. @1 naturale AI, but see 3305 and 3317.$  </p>
