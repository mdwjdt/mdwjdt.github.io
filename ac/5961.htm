<h4 align="center"></h4><p><strong>5961.</strong>创世记45:24-28.于是约瑟打发他弟兄们走，他们就离开；他又对他们说，你们不要在路上相争。他们从埃及上去，来到迦南地他们的父亲雅各那里。告诉他说，约瑟还活着，并且作埃及全地掌权的人。雅各心里冰凉，因为不信他们。他们便将约瑟对他们说的一切话都告诉了他。他又看见约瑟打发来接他的车辆，他们父亲雅各的灵就苏醒了。以色列说，够了！我的儿子约瑟还活着。趁我未死以先，我要去见他。<br />“于是约瑟打发他弟兄们走，他们就离开”表隐藏。“他又对他们说，你们不要在路上相争”表赋予他们的觉知，即他们要和平共处。“他们从埃及上去”表从教会所拥有的记忆知识中退离。“来到迦南地他们的父亲雅各那里”表属世良善，而非属灵良善所住的地方。“告诉他说”表流注和洞察。“约瑟还活着”表内在还没有被弃绝。“并且作埃及全地掌权的人”表属世心智在它的权柄和掌控之下。“雅各心里冰凉，因为不信他们”表属世层的生命的缺乏和由此而来的理解力的缺乏。“他们便将约瑟对他们说的一切话都告诉了他”表从属灵层的属天层而来的流注。“他又看见约瑟打发来接他的车辆”表由此所获得的让人信服的教义事物。“他们父亲雅各的灵就苏醒了”表新生命或生命的新样。“以色列说”表现在的属灵良善。“够了！我的儿子约瑟还活着”表对内在没有灭亡的喜悦。“趁我未死以先，我要去见他”表渴望在新事物到来之前联结。</p>

Verses 24-28. And he sent his brethren away, and they departed; and he said unto them, Contend not in the way. And they went up out of Egypt, and came into the land of Canaan unto Jacob their father. 
And they told him, saying, Joseph is yet alive, and he is ruler in all the land of Egypt. And his heart failed, because he believed them not. And they spake unto him all the words of Joseph which he 
spake unto them; and he saw the carts which Joseph had sent to carry him, and the spirit of Jacob their father revived; and Israel said, It is much; Joseph my son is yet alive; I will go and see him before 
I die. "And he sent his brethren away, and they departed," signifies concealment; "and he said unto them, Contend not in the way," signifies a perception given that they should be in tranquillity; 
"and they went up out of Egypt," signifies a receding from the memory-knowledges of the church; "and came into the land of Canaan unto Jacob their father," signifies a dwelling where was natural good 
but not spiritual good; "and they told him, saying," signifies influx and notice; "Joseph is yet alive," signifies that the internal was not rejected; "and he is ruler in all the land of Egypt," signifies 
that the natural mind is under its authority; "and his heart failed, because he believed them not," signifies a lack of life of the natural and thence of understanding; "and they spake unto him 
all the words of Joseph which he spake unto them," signifies influx from the celestial of the spiritual; "and he saw the carts which Joseph had sent to carry him," signifies doctrinal things thence 
derived which might persuade; "and the spirit of Jacob their father revived," signifies new life; "and Israel said," signifies spiritual good now; "It is much: Joseph my son is yet alive," signifies joy 
that the internal had not perished; "I will go and see him before I die," signifies a longing for conjunction previous to what is new. </p>

Verses 24-28 And he sent his brothers away, and they went; and he said to them, Do not quarrel on the way. And they went up out of Egypt and came to the land of Canaan, to Jacob their father. And they 
told him, saying, Joseph is still alive, and he has dominion in all the land of Egypt. And his heart failed, for he did not believe them. And they spoke to him all Joseph's words which he had spoken 
to them; and he saw the carts which Joseph had sent to carry him, and the spirit of Jacob their father revived. And Israel said, Enough;<A name="fntext1"></a><A href="#fn1"><sup>a</sup></a> Joseph my son is still alive. I will go and see him before I 
die.  </p>
<p>'And he sent his brothers away, and they went' means a concealment from view. 'And he said to them, Do not quarrel on the way' means the perception imparted to them that they should be at peace. 
'And they went up out of Egypt' means a departure from the factual knowledge which the Church possesses. 'And came to the land of Canaan, to Jacob their father' means the dwelling-place where natural 
but not spiritual good resides. 'And they told him, saying' means influx and discernment. 'Joseph is still alive' means that the internal has not been cast away. 'And he has dominion in all the land 
of Egypt' means that the natural mind is under its power and control. 'And his heart failed, for he did not believe them' means a lack of natural life, and a consequent lack of understanding. 'And 
they spoke to him all Joseph's words which he had spoken to them' means an influx from the celestial of the spiritual. 'And he saw the carts which Joseph had sent to carry him' means matters of doctrine 
received from this which might prove convincing. 'And the spirit of Jacob their father revived' means newness of life. 'And Israel said' means spiritual good now. 'Enough; Joseph my son is still alive' 
means joy that the internal had not perished. 'I will go and see him before I die' means the desire to be joined before what is new comes in.

Vers. 24-28.  Et dimisit fratres suos, et iverunt, et dixit ad illos, Ne contendatis in via. Et ascenderunt ex Aegypto, et venerunt terram Canaan ad Jacobum patrem eorum. Et indicaverunt illi, dicendo, 
Adhuc Joseph vivit, et quod ille dominans in omni terra Aegypti; et defecit cor ejus, quia non credidit illis. Et locuti sunt ad illum omnia verba Josephi quae locutus ad illos; et vidit vehicula 
quae misit Joseph ad ferendum illum; et revixit spiritus Jacobi patris illorum. Et dixit Israel,  Multum, adhuc Joseph filius meus vivit, ibo et videbo illum antequam morior. `Et dimisit fratres suos 
et iverunt' significat occultationem: `et dixit ad illos, Ne contendatis in via' significat perceptionem datam ut in tranquillo sint: `et ascenderunt ex Aegypto' significat recessionem a scientificis 
Ecclesiae: `et venerunt terram Canaan ad Jacobum patrem {1}suum significat habitationem ubi bonum naturale non spirituale: `et  indicaverunt illi, dicendo' significat influxum et apperceptionem: `Adhuc 
Joseph vivit' significat quod internum non rejectum: `et quod ille dominans in omni terra Aegypti' significat quod mens naturalis sub ejus potestate sit: `et defecit cor ejus, quia non credidit illis 
significat deficientiam vitae naturalis, et inde intellectus: `et locuti sunt ad illum omnia verba Josephi quae locutus ad illos' significat influxum ex caelesti spiritualis: `et vidit vehicula quae 
misit Josephus ad ferendum, illum' significat doctrinalia inde quae persuaderent: `et revixit spiritus Jacobi patris illorum' significat vitam novam: `et dixit Israel' significat bonum spirituale nunc: 
`Multum, adhuc Joseph filius meus vivit' significat gaudium quod internum non perierit: `ibo et videbo illum antequam morior' significat desiderium conjunctionis, antequam novum.   @1 Thus A I here
