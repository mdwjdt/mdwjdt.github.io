Verses 14-24. And Jehovah said unto Moses, Pharaoh's heart is made heavy, he refuseth to let the people go. Go unto Pharaoh in the morning; behold he goeth out unto the waters; and stand thou to meet 
him near the bank of the river; and the rod which was turned into a serpent take in thy hand. And thou shalt say unto him, Jehovah the God of the Hebrews hath sent me unto thee, saying, Let My people 
go, that they may serve Me in the wilderness; and behold hitherto thou hast not heard. Thus said Jehovah, In this thou shalt know that I am Jehovah; behold I smite with the rod that is in my hand upon 
the waters which are in the river, and they shall be turned into blood. And the fish that is in the river shall die, and the river shall stink; and the Egyptians shall labor to drink waters from the 
river. And Jehovah said unto Moses, Say unto Aaron, Take thy rod and stretch out thy hand over the waters of Egypt, over their streams, over their rivers, and over their pools, and over every gathering 
of their waters, and they shall be blood; and there shall be blood in all the land of Egypt, both in the woods and in the stones. And Moses and Aaron did so, as Jehovah commanded; and he lifted up 
the rod, and smote the waters that were in the river, unto the eyes of Pharaoh, and unto the eyes of his servants; and all the waters that were in the river were turned into blood. And the fish that was 
in the river died; and the river stank, and the Egyptians could not drink water from the river; and there was blood in all the land of Egypt. And the magicians of Egypt did so with their enchantments; 
and Pharaoh's heart was made hard, and he heard them not, as Jehovah had spoken. And Pharaoh looked back, and came unto his house, and did not set his heart even to this. And all the Egyptians digged 
round about the river for waters to drink; for they could not drink of the waters of the river. "And Jehovah said unto Moses" signifies Divine instruction; "Pharaoh's heart is made heavy, he refuseth 
to let the people go," signifies that they obstinately determined not to release those whom they infest; "go unto Pharaoh in the morning," signifies elevation to things more confirmatory; "behold 
he goeth out unto the waters," signifies that then they who were infesting would be in falsities from fallacies; "and stand thou to meet him near the bank of the river," signifies influx according to 
the state; "and the rod that was turned into a serpent take in thy hand," signifies power like the former; "and thou shalt say unto him," signifies command; "Jehovah the God of the Hebrews hath sent me 
unto thee, saying," signifies from the Divine of the church to those who were infesting; "Let My people go," signifies that they should release; "that they may serve Me in the wilderness," signifies 
worship in what is obscure; "and behold hitherto thou hast not heard," signifies no obedience; "thus said Jehovah, In this thou shalt know that I am Jehovah," signifies that they may be in fear of the 
Divine; "behold, I smite with the rod that is in my hand upon the waters which are in the river," signifies power over the falsities which are from fallacies; "and they shall be turned into blood," 
signifies that they shall falsify truths; "and the fish that is in the river shall die," signifies that the memory-knowledge of truth shall be extinguished; "and the river shall stink," signifies aversion 
for it; "and the Egyptians shall labor to drink waters from the river," signifies that they would desire to know scarcely anything about it; "and Jehovah said unto Moses," signifies execution; "Say 
unto Aaron, Take thy rod and stretch out thy hand over the waters of Egypt," signifies power against the falsities of those who infest; "over their streams, over their rivers," signifies against the 
things of doctrine; "and over their pools," signifies against the memory-knowledges that were of service to them; "and over every gathering of their waters," signifies where there is any falsity; "and 
they shall be blood," signifies that they shall falsify truths; "and there shall be blood in all the land of Egypt," signifies total falsification; "both in woods and in stones," signifies of the good 
that is of charity and of the truth that is of faith; "and Moses and Aaron did so as Jehovah commanded," signifies the effect; "and he lifted up the rod, and smote the waters that were in the river," 
signifies strong power against the falsities; "unto the eyes of Pharaoh, and unto the eyes of his servants," signifies in the notice of all who were infesting; "and all the waters that were in the 
river were turned into blood," signifies the consequent falsification of all truth; "and the fish that was in the river died," signifies the memory-knowledge of truth also extinguished; "and the river 
stank," signifies aversion; "and the Egyptians could not drink water from the river," signifies that they desired to know scarcely anything about it; "and there was blood in all the land of Egypt," 
signifies total falsification; "and the magicians of Egypt did so with their enchantments," signifies that their falsifiers fashioned the like by abusing order; "and Pharaoh's heart was made hard," signifies 
obstinacy; "and he heard them not," signifies no reception and no obedience; "as Jehovah had spoken," signifies according to the prediction; "and Pharaoh looked back, and came unto his house," 
signifies thought and reflection from falsities; "and did not set his heart even to this," signifies resistance from the will, and the consequent obstinacy; "and all the Egyptians digged round about 
the river for waters to drink," signifies a thorough search for truth which they might apply to falsities; "for they could not drink of the waters of the river," signifies no application from mere falsities. </p>

Verses 14-24 And Jehovah said to Moses, Pharaoh's heart is inflexible; he refuses to send the people away. Go to Pharaoh [in the morning; behold, he goes out to the water]. And you are to stand so as 
to meet him beside the bank of the river; and the rod which was turned into a serpent, take in your hand. And you shall say to him, Jehovah, the God of the Hebrews, has sent me to you, saying, Send My 
people away, and let them serve Me in the wilderness; and behold, you have not heard up to now. Thus said Jehovah, In this you will know that I am Jehovah - behold, I strike with the rod which is in 
my hand upon the waters which are in the river, and they will be turned into blood. And the fish that are in the river will die, and the river will stink; and the Egyptians will find it difficult<A name="fntext1"></a><A href="#fn1"><sup>a</sup></a> to 
drink water from the river. And Jehovah said to Moses, Say to Aaron, Take your rod, and stretch out your hand over the waters of Egypt, over their rivers, over their streams, and over their pools, and 
over every gathering of their waters, and they will be blood; and there will be blood in all the land of Egypt, both in vessels of wood and in vessels of stone. And Moses and Aaron did so, as Jehovah 
had commanded; and he lifted up the rod and struck the waters which were in the river, before the eyes of Pharaoh and before the eyes of his servants. And all the waters which were in the river were 
converted into blood. And the fish which were in the river died, and the river stank, and the Egyptians were unable to drink water from the river; and there was blood in the entire land of Egypt. And 
the magicians of Egypt did the same with their enchantments; and Pharaoh's heart was unyielding, and he did not hear<A name="fntext2"></a><A href="#fn2"><sup>b</sup></a> them, as Jehovah had spoken. And Pharaoh looked back and went to his house, and 
he did not take even this to heart.<A name="fntext3"></a><A href="#fn3"><sup>c</sup></a> And all the Egyptians dug round about the river for water to drink; for they could not drink from the waters of the river.  </p>
<p>'And Jehovah said to Moses' means 
Divine instruction. 'Pharaoh's heart is inflexible; he refuses to send the people away' means that they were obstinately determined not to leave those whom they were molesting. 'Go to Pharaoh in the morning' 
means being raised to stronger proofs. 'Behold, he goes out to the water' means that at this time those who molested were steeped in falsities resulting from illusions. 'And you are to stand so 
as to meet him beside the bank of the river' means an influx in keeping with the state. 'And the rod which was turned into a serpent, take in your hand' means the same power as before. 'And you shall 
say to him' means a command. 'Jehovah, the God of the Hebrews, has sent me to you, saying' means coming from the Deity of the Church to those who were molesting. 'Send My people away' means that they 
are to leave them. 'And let them serve Me in the wilderness' means worship in obscurity. 'And behold, you have not heard up to now' means disobedience. 'And Jehovah said, In this you will know that 
I am Jehovah' means in order that they may have a fear of the Divine. 'Behold, I strike with the rod which is in my hand upon the waters which are in the river' means power over falsities which are the 
result of illusions. 'And they will be turned into blood' means that they will falsify truths. 'And the fish that are in the river will die' means that factual knowledge of truth will be destroyed. 
'And the river will stink' means an aversion to it. 'And the Egyptians will find it difficult to drink water from the river' means so that they would wish to know as little as possible about it. 'And 
Jehovah said to Moses' means putting it into effect. 'Say to Aaron, Take your rod, and stretch out your hand over the waters of Egypt' means power directed against the falsities residing with the molesters. 
'Over their rivers, over their streams' means against teachings [that consist of falsity]. 'And over their pools' means against the factual knowledge subservient to them. 'And over every gathering 
of their waters' means where any falsity exists. 'And they will be blood' means that they will falsify truths. 'And there will be blood in all the land of Egypt' means total falsification. 'Both in 
vessels of wood and in vessels of stone' means of the good of charity and of the truth of faith. 'And Moses and Aaron did so, as Jehovah had commanded' means putting it into effect. 'And he lifted up 
the rod and struck the waters which were in the river' means strong power directed against falsities. 'Before the eyes of Pharaoh and before the eyes of his servants' means to the discernment of all 
those who were molesting. 'And all the waters which were in the river were converted into blood' means consequent falsification of all truth. 'And the fish which were in the river died' means the destruction 
of factual knowledge of truth too. 'And the river stank' means aversion. 'And the Egyptians were unable to drink water from the river' means that they wished to know as little as possible about 
it. 'And there was blood in the entire land of Egypt' means total falsification. 'And the magicians of Egypt did the same with their enchantments' means that by a misuse of order the falsifiers among 
them produced something that looked the same. 'And Pharaoh's heart was unyielding' means obstinacy. 'And he did not hear them' means non-acceptance and disobedience. 'As Jehovah had spoken' means as 
accorded with what had been foretold. 'And Pharaoh looked back and went to his house' means thought and reflection based on falsities. 'And he did not take this to heart' means resistance arising in 
the will and consequent obstinacy. 'And all the Egyptians dug round about the river for water to drink' means searching out truth which they could apply to falsities. 'For they could not drink from the 
waters of the river' means non-application through the use of utter falsities.

Vers. 14-24.  Et dixit Jehovah ad Moschen, Ingravatum est cor Pharaonis, renuit mittere populum.  Vade ad Pharaonem [in matutino, ecce egreditur ad aquas], et consistes obviam illi juxta ripam fluminis, 
et baculum qui versus in serpentem accipe in manum tuam.  Et dices ad illum, Jehovah Deus Hebraeorum misit me ad te, dicendo, Mitte populum Meum, et serviant Mihi in deserto, et ecce non audivisti 
usque huc.  Ita dixit Jehovah, In hoc cognosces quod Ego Jehovah, ecce ego percutio baculo qui in manu mea, super aquas quae in fluvio, et vertentur in sanguinem.  Et piscis qui in fluvio morietur, 
et putebit fluvius, et laborabunt Aegyptii ad bibendum aquas e fluvio.  Et dixit Jehovah ad Moschen, Dic ad Aharonem, Accipe baculum tuum, et extende manum tuam super aquas Aegypti, super flumina illorum, 
super fluvios illorum, et super stagna illorum, et super omnem congregationem aquarum illorum, et erunt sanguis; et erit sanguis in omni terra Aegypti, et in lignis et in lapidibus.  Et fecerunt 
ita Moscheh et Aharon quemadmodum praecepit Jehovah, et sustulit baculum, et percussit aquas quae in fluvio, ad oculos Pharaonis, et ad oculos servorum illius; et conversae sunt omnes aquae quae in fluvio 
in sanguinem.  Et piscis qui in fluvio moriebatur, et putuit fluvius, et non potuerunt Aegyptii bibere aquam ex fluvio; et fuit sanguis in tota terra Aegypti.  Et fecerunt ita magi Aegypti incantationibus 
suis; et obfirmatum cor Pharaonis, et non audivit ad illos, quemadmodum locutus Jehovah.  Et respexit Pharao, et venit ad domum suam, et non posuit cor suum etiam ad hoc.  Et foderunt omnes 
Aegyptii circum fluvium aquas ad bibendum, quia non potuerunt bibere ex aquis fluvii.  `Et dixit Jehovah ad Moschen' significat instructionem Divinam: `Ingravatum est cor Pharaonis, renuit mittere populum'

significat quod relinquent: `et serviant Mihi in deserto' significat cultum in obscuro: `et ecce non audivisti usque huc' significat non oboedientiam: `et dixit Jehovah, In hoc cognosces quod Ego Jehovah' 
significat ut timorem habeant pro Divino: `ecce ego percutio baculo qui in manu mea super aquas quae in fluvio' significat potentiam super falsa quae ex fallaciis; `et vertentur in sanguinem'

significat potentiam in falsa quae apud infestantes: `super flumina illorum, super fluvios illorum' significat in doctrinalia {2}: `et super stagna (c)illorum significat in scientifica illis inservientia: 
`et super omnem congregationem aquarum' significat ubi aliquid falsum: `et erunt sanguis' significat quod falsificabunt vera: `et erit sanguis in omni terra Aegypti' significat falsificationem
