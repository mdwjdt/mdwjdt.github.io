<h3 align="center" class="ired">属天的奥秘 第10118节</h3>
<h4 align="center"></h4><p><strong>10118</strong>.“你要这样向亚伦和他儿子行”表这整个过程，主之荣耀和祂进入天堂并教会的流注的代表。这从“亚伦”和“他儿子”的代表，以及“这样行”的含义清楚可知：“亚伦”是指属天的神性良善方面的主（参看<a href="9809.htm">9809</a>节）；“他儿子”是指神性属灵良善方面的主（<a href="10068.htm">10068</a>节）；“这样行”，也就是膏抹他们和充满他们的手，由此给他们祝圣以承接祭司职分，是指为叫他们可以代表主荣耀祂的人身，以及从祂得了荣耀的人身进入天堂和教会的流注。因为“膏抹”是主之人身的荣耀的代表，“充满手”是其从得了荣耀的人身进入天堂和教会的流注的代表。膏抹代表在其神性人身里面的主之神性良善（参看<a href="9954.htm">9954</a>节）；因而是指荣耀，也就是神性人身与被称为“父”的神性本身的合一（<a href="10053.htm">10053</a>节）；充满手代表通过天堂和教会里的神性真理所行使的主之神性能力，以及那里对这真理的传给和接受（<a href="10019.htm">10019</a>节），因而代表它的流注。</p>

And thus shalt thou do to Aaron and to his sons. That this signifies this representative of the glorification of the Lord and of His influx into the heavens and into the church, is evident from the representation 
of Aaron, as being the Lord as to Divine good (see n. 9809); from the representation of his sons, as being the Lord as to Divine spiritual good (n. 10068); and from the signification of 
"doing thus," that is, anointing them and filling their hands, and thereby inaugurating into the priesthood, as being that they may represent the Lord in respect to the glorification of His Human, and 
the consequent influx into the heavens and into the church; for the anointing was representative of the glorification of His Human, and the filling of the hand was representative of His influx from this 
into the heavens and the church. (That anointing represented the Divine good of the Lord in His Divine Human, see n. 9954; consequently glorification, which is the unition of the Divine Human with 
the Divine Itself called "the Father," n. 10053; and that the filling of the hand represented the Divine power of the Lord through Divine truth in the heavens and the church, and its capability of communication 
and reception there, thus its influx, n. 10019.) </p>

'And thus you shall do to Aaron and his sons' means this whole process, representative of the glorification of the Lord and of His influx into the heavens and into the Church. This is clear from the 
representation of 'Aaron' as the Lord in respect of Divine Good that is celestial, dealt with in <a href="9809.htm">9809</a>, and from the representation of 'his sons' as the Lord in respect of Divine Good that is spiritual, 
dealt with in <a href="10068.htm">10068</a>; and from the meaning of 'thus doing' - that is, anointing them and filling their hands, and thereby consecrating them to the priestly office - as in order that they may represent 
the Lord's glorification of His Human, and the influx from His glorified Human into the heavens and into the Church. For 'anointing' was representative of the glorification of His Human, and 'filling 
the hand' was representative of His influx from the glorified Human into the heavens and into the Church.  </p>
<p>Anointing represented the Lord's Divine Good within His Divine Human, see <a href="9954.htm">9954</a>, consequently 
the glorification, that is, the uniting of the Divine Human to Divinity itself, called the Father, <a href="10053.htm">10053</a>.  Filling the hand represented the Lord's Divine power exercised through Divine Truth in 
the heavens and in the Church, and the transmission and reception of that Truth there, <a href="10019.htm">10019</a>, and so represented the influx of it.  </p>

`Et facies Aharoni et filiis ejus ita': quod significet hoc repraesentativum glorificationis Domini, ac influxus Ipsius in caelos et in Ecclesiam, constat ex repraesentatione `Aharonis' quod sit Dominus 
quoad Divinum Bonum caeleste, de qua n. 9809 {1}, et ex repraesentatione `filiorum ejus' quod sit Dominus quoad Divinum Bonum spirituale, de qua n. 10,068, et ex (x)significatione `facere ita,' hoc 
est, {2} ungere illos et implere manus eorum, et sic inaugurare in sacerdotium, quod sit ut repraesentent Dominum quoad glorificationem Humani Ipsius, et influxum inde {3} in caelos et in Ecclesiam; 
nam unctio erat repraesentativum glorificationis Humani Ipsius, ac impletio manus erat repraesentativum influxus Ipsius (o)inde in caelos et in Ecclesiam; quod unctio repraesentaverit Divinum Bonum 
Domini in Divino Humano Ipsius, videatur n. 9954, consequenter glorificationem, quae est unitio Divini Humani cum ipso Divino, quod Pater vocatur, n. 10,053; et quod impletio manus repraesentaverit potentiam 
Divinam Domini per {4} Divinum Verum in caelis et in Ecclesia, ac communicativum et receptivum ejus ibi, n. 10,019, ita influxum ejus {5}. @1 9806$ @2 seu$ @3 Ipsius glorificationem, et quoad
