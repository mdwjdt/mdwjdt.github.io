<h3 align="center" class="ired">属天的奥秘 第3855节</h3>
<h4 align="center"></h4><p><strong>3855.</strong>“利亚被恨”表对外在真理的情感并不怎么珍贵，因为它离神性更远。这从“恨”的含义和“利亚”的代表清楚可知：“恨”是指不珍贵；“利亚”是指对外在真理的情感，如前所述。与内在真理相比，外在真理距离神性更遥远。这一点从以下事实可以看出来，即：外在真理是内在真理的彰显，因为外在真理是由被看作一个简单整体的成千上万的内在真理所构成的形像和样式。由于这就是外在真理的性质，所以它们离神性更远；因为神性在至内层以上，或在至高处。主从至高处流入人的至内层，通过至内层流入他的内层，再通过内层流入他的外在，因而既间接又直接地流入。由于外在离神性更远，所以他们也由此相对无序，还不允许自己被带入到如内在那样的秩序中。<br />此中情形就像种子：种子的内部比外部更完善，并且内部如此完善以至于能使它们以自己的次序长成一整株植物或一整棵树，包括叶和果，其外在形式很容易因各种因素而受到损害，但种子的内在或至内在形式不那么容易受害，因为它们本质上更内在、更完善。这种情形与人的内在并外在部分是一样的。因此，当人正在重生时，理性层先于属世层重生（<a href="3493.htm">3493</a>节）。属世层的重生来得更晚且更艰难，因为许多无序的事物都在它里面，容易受到身体和尘世的伤害。正因如此，我们才说这些事物“并不怎么珍贵”。不过，它们越是与内在事物一致，并有助于生命和它们里面的内在事物的视见，以及人的重生，也就越珍贵。</p>

That Leah was hated. That this signifies that the affection of external truth was not so dear because it was further from the Divine, is evident from the signification of "hated," as being what is not 
dear; and from the representation of Leah, as being the affection of external truth (concerning which see above). That external truths are more remote from the Divine than internal truths, may be seen 
from the fact that external things come forth from internal ones; for external things are images and forms composed of myriads of internal things which appear as a one; and this being the nature of 
external things, they are further from the Divine; for the Divine is above the inmost, or in the highest. The Lord flows from the highest into the inmosts of man, and through these into his interiors, 
and through these again into his externals; thus He flows in mediately, and also immediately; and as the externals are further from the Divine, they are also on this account relatively without order, 
nor do they suffer themselves to be reduced to such order as do the internals. The case herein is the same as it is with seeds, which are more perfect within than without, being so perfect within as 
to enable them to produce a whole plant, or a whole tree, in its order, together with its leaves and fruits, the external forms of which may easily suffer injury from various causes, but not so much 
so the internal or inmost forms of the seeds, which are in a more interior and perfect nature. The case is the same with the internals and externals of man, and therefore when man is being regenerated, 
he is regenerated as to the rational before he is regenerated as to the natural (n. 3493); and the regeneration of the natural is both later and more difficult, because in it are many things which are 
not in order and are exposed to injuries from the body and the world; and this being the case, it is said that these things are "not so dear;" but insofar as they agree with internal things, and insofar 
as they conduce to the life and to the sight of the internal things that are within them, and also to man's regeneration, so far they too are dear. </p>

'That Leah was hated' means that the affection for external truth was not so dear because it was further away from the Divine. This is clear from the meaning of 'hated' as not dear, and from the representation 
of 'Leah' as the affection for external truth, dealt with already. The fact that external truths are more remote from the Divine than internal truths are may be seen from the consideration 
that external truths are manifestations of internal ones, for external truths are images and forms made of many thousands of internal truths which are seen as a simple whole. And because this is what 
external truths are like they are further away from the Divine; for the Divine is above what is inmost, that is, the Divine is in the highest. The Lord flows in from the highest into the inmost parts 
of man, and through these into his interior parts, and through these in turn into his external parts, and so is flowing mediately as well as immediately. And because external things are further away from 
the Divine they are also for that reason lacking order when compared with internal and do not allow themselves to be brought into order in the way that internal ones do. </p>
<p></p>
<p><b>[2]</b>
 It is like seeds, which 
are more perfect inwardly than they are outwardly, so perfect inwardly that from within they are able to bring forth a whole young plant or a whole tree in its own ordered way, together with leaves 
and fruit, whose outward forms can easily suffer all kinds of damage, more so than the internal and inmost forms of the seeds which are by their very nature more interior and perfect. It is similar 
with the internal and external parts of man. Consequently when a person is being regenerated, the rational is regenerated before the natural, <a href="3493.htm">3493</a>. The regeneration of the natural comes later and is 
more difficult because many things remain unordered there and are subject to damage from the body and the world. That being so, it is said that these are not so dear. But to the extent that they agree 
with internal things and contribute to the life and to a sight of the internal things within them, as well as to the regeneration of man, they too are dear. </p>

`Quod exosa Leah': quod significet quod affectio veri externi non ita cara, quia longius a Divino, constat a significatione `exosae' quod sit non cara; et ex repraesentatione `Leae' quod sit affectio 
veri externi, de qua prius; quod vera externa a Divino remotiora sint quam interna, constare potest ex eo quod externa existant ab internis, sunt enim externa imagines et formae ex myriadibus 
internorum compositae, quae ut unum apparent; </p>
<p>et quia externa talia sunt, longius a Divino sunt, {1}nam Divinum est supra intimum seu in supremo; influit {2}Dominus e supremo in intima hominis, et 
per haec in ejus interiora, et per haec iterum in externa, ita mediate, et praeterea etiam immediate: et quia externa sunt longius a Divino, ideo etiam inordinata sunt respective, nec ita in ordinem 
se redigi patiuntur sicut interna; </p>
<p>[2]se habet hoc sicut semina, quae intus perfectiora sunt quam extus, (c)ac intus tam perfecta ut inde producere possint totam plantam aut totam arborem suo ordine 
cum foliis et fructibus, quorum formae externae facile possunt laedi a quibuscumque injuriis, non autem ita internae seu intimae seminum, quae in natura {3}interiore et perfectiore sunt; similiter 
se habet cum {4}hominis internis et externis, quare etiam cum regeneratur homo, prius regeneratur quoad rationale quam quoad naturale, n. 3493, ac naturale et serius et aegrius, quia ibi plura 
inordinata sunt, ac injuriis a corpore et a mundo exposita; et quia ita, dicitur quod haec non ita cara sint; quantum autem concordant cum internis, et quantum conducunt ad vitam et ad visum internorum 
in se, ut et quantum ad regenerationem hominis, tantum etiam cara sunt. @1 quod$ @2 i enim$ @3 puriore$ @4 after externis$ </p>
