<h4 align="center"></h4><p><strong>330.</strong>“血的声音”表仁爱已不复存在（10节）；“从这地受诅咒”表异端邪说（11节）；“在地上游离飘荡”表虚假及随之的邪恶（12节）；由于他们背离主，所以身陷永死的危险（13-14节）；但因为仁随后要通过信被植入，所以“给该隐立一个记号”，象征严禁侵犯这信（15节）；“住在伊甸东边”表从原先的地方挪走（16节）。</p>

<p><strong>[NCE]330.</strong> Charity that has been extinguished is called the voice of blood (verse 10), corrupt theology is called a curse from the ground (verse 11), and falsity and evil from that theology are the wanderer and fugitive on the earth (verse 12). Since those people turned away from the Lord, they were in danger of eternal death (verses 13, 14), but faith was the means by which charity would be implanted from then on, so a sacred ban was placed on the violation of it. This is the mark put on Cain (verse 15). The removal of faith from the seat it used to occupy is Cain's residence to the east of Eden (verse 16). </p>
<p align="center"><b>Potts(1905-1910) 330</b></p><p><b>330.</b>
Charity extinguished is called the "voice of bloods" (verse 10); perverted doctrine, the "curse from the ground" (verse 11); the falsity and evil originating thence, the "fugitive and wanderer in the 
earth" (verse 12). And as they had averted themselves from the Lord, they were in danger of eternal death (verses 13, 14). But as it was through faith that charity would afterwards be implanted, faith 
was made inviolable, and this is signified by the "mark set upon Cain" (verse 15). And its removal from its former position is denoted by "Cain dwelling toward the east of Eden" (verse 16). </p>

Charity that had been annihilated is called 'the voice of blood'<A name="fntext1"></a><A href="#fn1"><sup>a</sup></a>, verse 10, erroneous doctrine 'cursed from the ground', verse 11, falsity and consequent evil 'a wanderer and fugitive in the earth', 
verse 12. And because they turned away from the Lord they were in danger of eternal death, verses 13, 14; but because it was faith by means of which charity would afterwards be implanted, it was utterly 
forbidden to violate it, which is 'putting a sign on Cain', verse 15; and to remove it from the position it held previously is the meaning of 'his dwelling towards the east of Eden', verse 16.

Exstincta charitas vocatur 'vox sanguinum,' vers. 10: perversa doctrina 'maledictio de humo,' vers. 11: falsum et malum inde est 'vagum et profugum in terra,' vers. 12: et quia averterunt se a Domino, 
quod periculum mortis aeternae, vers. 13, 14: sed quia: fides est per quam implantaretur postea charitas, sacrosanctum erat illam violare, quod est 'signum positum Caino,' vers. 15: et a sede ubi prius 
illam removere, est quod 'habitaret versus orientem Edenis,' vers. 16. </p>
