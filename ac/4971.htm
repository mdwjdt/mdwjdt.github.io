<h3 align="center" class="ired">属天的奥秘 第4971节</h3>
<h4 align="center"></h4><p><strong>4971.</strong>“耶和华与约瑟同在”表神性存在于属灵层的属天层里面。这从“约瑟”的代表清楚可知，“约瑟”是指来自理性层的属灵层的属天层，如前所述（<a href="4963.htm">4963</a>节）；由于所论述的主题是此处主在其人身里面的内在人，所以“耶和华与约瑟同在”表示神性存在于属灵层的属天层里面。神性之所以存在于祂的人身里面，是因为祂从耶和华成孕。神性并不存在于天使里面，仅与他们同在，因为他们只是从主接受神性的形式。</p>

And Jehovah was with Joseph. That this signifies that the Divine was in the celestial of the spiritual, is evident from the representation of Joseph, as being the celestial of the spiritual from the 
rational (of which above, n. 4963); and because the subject treated of is the Lord here as to the internal man in His Human - by "Jehovah was with him" is signified that the Divine was therein; for the 
Divine was in His Human, because He was conceived of Jehovah. In the case of the angels, the Divine is not in them, but is present with them, because they are only forms recipient of the Divine from 
the Lord. </p>

'And Jehovah was with Joseph' means that the Divine existed within the celestial of the spiritual. This is clear from the representation of 'Joseph' as the celestial of the spiritual from the rational, 
dealt with above in <a href="4963.htm">4963</a>; and because the Lord is the subject, at this point His Internal Man within His Human, 'Jehovah was with him' means that the Divine existed within it. The Divine existed within 
His Human because He had been conceived from Jehovah. The Divine does not exist within angels; it is merely present with them, because they are merely forms receiving the Divine coming forth from 
the Lord. </p>

`Et fuit Jehovah cum Josepho': quo significet quod caelesti spiritualis inesset Divinum, constat ex repraesentatione `Josephi' quod sit caeleste spiritualis e rationali, de qua supra n. 4963; et quia 
de Domino agitur, hic de Interno Nomine in Humano Ipsius, per `fuit Jehovah cum illo' significatur quod inesset Divinum; inerat enim Divinum `Humano Ipsius' quia a Jehovah conceptus fuit; apud angelos 
non inest Divinum, sed adest, quia sunt modo formae recipientes Divini a Domino. </p>
