<h3 align="center" class="ired">属天的奥秘 第4992节</h3>
<h4 align="center"></h4><p><strong>4992.</strong>“看哪！在家里，我主什么也不知道”表属世良善甚至不渴望将任何事物变成自己的。这从他的“主”和“在家里什么也不知道”的含义清楚可知：“主”是指属世良善（参看<a href="4973.htm">4973</a>节）；“在家里什么也不知道”是指不渴望将任何事物变成它自己的。这些话的含义若不凭内义上的思路，就无法看明白，因为现在论述的主题是第三个状态，在第三个状态下，属灵层的属天层存在于属世层中。在此状态下，属灵的属世良善和真理与非属灵的属世良善和真理分离。因此，“在家里什么也不知道”表示没有将任何事物变成它自己的那种渴望。不过，这些事是奥秘，若不通过例子，就无法看明白。<br />故以下面的例子来说明。唯独出于欲望与人的妻子结合，这是某种非属灵的属世之事；出于婚姻之爱与人的妻子结合，这是某种属灵的属世之事。此后（即当他成为她的丈夫时），他若唯独出于欲望与妻子结合，就会视自己为罪人，和性行为不道德的人没什么两样；因此，他不再渴望将这种欲望变成自己的。再举一例：向朋友行善只是因为他是朋友，却不管他的品质如何，这就是一种非属灵的属世行为；但由于居于朋友里面的良善而向他行善，尤其将良善作为要向其行善的朋友，这是一种属灵的属世行为。当人持这种态度时，他便意识到，他若向邪恶的朋友行善，就是一个罪人，因为在这种情况下，他就是在通过这个朋友向其他人行恶。当处于这种状态时，他就不会去将以前存在于他里面的非属灵的属世良善变成自己的。其它一切事也是如此。</p>

<p align="center"><b>Potts(1905-1910) 4992</b></p><p><b>4992.</b>
Behold, my lord knoweth not what is with me in the house. That this signifies that natural good did not desire even appropriation, is evident from the signification of his "lord," as being natural good 
(see n. 4973); and from the signification of "not knowing what is with me in the house," as being not to desire appropriation. That this is the meaning cannot be seen except from the series of things 
in the internal sense; for a third state is now treated of, in which the celestial of the spiritual was in the natural: in this state the good and truth natural which is spiritual, is separate from 
the good and truth natural which is not spiritual; and consequently by "not knowing what is in the house" is signified that there is no desire for appropriation. But these things, being arcana, cannot 
be made clear except by examples. Let the following example therefore serve for illustration. To be conjoined with one's wife from lust alone, this is natural not spiritual; but to be conjoined with 
one's wife from conjugial love, this is spiritual natural; and when the husband is afterward conjoined from lust alone, he believes that he transgresses, as one who does what is lascivious, and therefore 
he no longer desires that this should be appropriated to him. Let this also serve as an example. To benefit a friend, no matter what his quality, provided he is a friend is natural not spiritual; 
but to benefit a friend for the sake of the good that is in him, and still more to hold good itself as the friend which is to be benefited, this is spiritual natural; and when anyone is in this, he knows 
that he transgresses if he benefits a friend who is evil, for then through him he injures others. When he is in this state, he holds in aversion the appropriation of good natural not spiritual, in 
which good he was before. And so it is with everything else. </p>

<p align="center"><b>Elliott(1983-1999) 4992</b></p><p><b>4992.</b>
'Behold, my lord does not concern himself with anything in the house' means that natural good did not have even the desire to make anything its own. This is clear from the meaning of 'his lord' as natural 
good, dealt with in <a href="4973.htm">4973</a>, and from the meaning of 'not concerning himself with anything in the house' as having no desire to make anything its own. This meaning of these words cannot be seen except 
from the train of thought in the internal sense, for now the subject is a third state, in which the celestial of the spiritual was present in the natural. In this state natural good and truth which 
are spiritual are separated from natural good and truth which are not spiritual. Consequently 'not concerning himself with anything in the house' means that no desire existed to make anything its own. 
But being arcana, these matters cannot be seen clearly without the help of examples. </p>
<p></p>
<p><b>[2]</b>
 Let the following serve to shed light on the matter. If mere lust leads a man to be joined to his wife, this 
is something natural which is unspiritual; but if conjugial love leads him to be joined to her this is something natural which is spiritual. And if after that - when he is her husband - it is mere 
lust that joins him to her, he considers himself to be a sinner who is no different from someone behaving in a sexually immoral way; which being so he has no further wish to make such lust his own. Or 
let another example be given. To do good to a friend, regardless of his character and simply because he is one's friend, is a natural action that is unspiritual; but to do good to a friend on account 
of the good residing with him, all the more so when one regards good itself as the friend to whom one is to do good, is a natural action that is spiritual. When this attitude exists with a person, he 
realizes that he himself is a sinner if he does good to a friend who is evil; for in that case he does evil to others through that friend. When this is his state he turns away from making his own that 
unspiritual natural good which had existed with him previously. The same is so with everything else.  </p>

</p><b>4992.</b>
`Ecce dominus meus non scit cum me quid in domo': quod significet quod bonum naturale ne quidem appropriationem cuperet, constat ex significatione `domini ejus' quod sit bonum naturale, de qua n. 
4973; et ex significatione `non scire cum me quid in domo' quod sit non cupere appropriationem; quod ille sensus sit, non videri potest quam ex serie rerum in sensu interno; agitur enim nunc de tertio 
statu, in quo caeleste spiritualis fuit in naturali; </p>
<p>in illo statu separatur bonum et verum naturale quod spirituale est, a bono et vero naturali quod non spirituale est; consequenter per `non 
scire quid in domo' significatur quod nulla cupiditas appropriationis sit; sed haec quia arcana {1} sunt, non illustrari possunt quam per exempla; sit itaque illustrationi hoc: [2] conjungi cum uxore 
sua ex sola libidine, hoc naturale non spirituale est, at conjungi cum uxore sua ex amore conjugiali, hoc naturale spirituale est; cum maritus dein ex sola libidine conjungitur {2}, tunc praevaricari 
se credit sicut qui lascivum quid facit, quapropter non cupit amplius ut (c)id ei approprietur.  Sit etiam illustrationi hoc: benefacere amico qualiscumque sit, modo amicus sit, est naturale 
non spirituale, at benefacere amico propter bonum apud illum, et magis ipsum bonum habere pro amico cui benefaciat, hoc naturale spirituale est, et tunc cum in hoc est, novit se praevaricari si amico 
qui malus est, benefaciat, nam tunc per illum malefacit aliis; cum in hoc statu est, {3} aversatur appropriationem boni naturalis non spiritualis, in quo prius fuit; </p>
<p>similiter se habet in reliquis. @1
