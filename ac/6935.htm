<h3 align="center" class="ired">属天的奥秘 第6935节</h3>
<h4 align="center"></h4><p><strong>6935.</strong>所着眼的目的清楚表明每个人当以哪种方式成为自己的邻舍，并先照顾好自己。如果目的唯独是为了财富、享乐、担任要职等等而比其他人更富有，那么这个目的就是邪恶的。因此，凡出于这样的目的而以为自己就是自己的邻舍之人就是在永远伤害自己。但是，如果目的是为了给自己和家人提供生活必需品，从而有条件照着仁之教义的吩咐行善，那么他就是在永远照顾自己。目的本身构成此人，或说使得一个人成为他自己，因为目的就是他的爱；事实上，每个人都以他所爱的东西为目的。</p>

<p align="center"><b>Potts(1905-1910) 6935</b></p><p><b>6935.</b>
The end in view declares in what way each person must be neighbor to himself, and must first of all take care of himself. If the end is that he may become richer than others merely for the sake of riches, 
pleasure, eminence, and the like, the end is evil; and therefore he who from such an end believes he is neighbor to himself, injures himself to eternity. But if the end is that he may acquire wealth 
for the sake of the necessities of life, for himself and for his family, so as to be in a state to do what is good according to the commandments of the doctrine of charity, he takes care of himself 
for eternity. The end itself makes the man, for the end is his love, because everyone has as the end that which he loves. </p>

<p align="center"><b>Elliott(1983-1999) 6935</b></p><p><b>6935.</b>
The end in view makes plain the way in which everyone ought to be a neighbour to himself and look after himself first. If his end is to become richer than others solely for the sake of possessing riches, 
indulging in pleasures, holding important positions, and the like, it is bad. Therefore anyone who supposes, because he is ruled by that kind of end, that he is being a neighbour to himself is harming 
himself for evermore. But if his end is to acquire wealth in order to provide the necessities of life for himself and his dependents and so be in a condition to do good in the ways that teachings 
about charity command, he is looking after himself for evermore. His actual end in view makes a person what he is, since that end constitutes his love; for everyone has as his end in view that which 
he loves. </p>

<p align="center"><b>Latin(1748-1756) 6935</b>
</p><b>6935.</b>
Finis declarat quomodo quisque sibi proximus erit, ac sibi primum consulet; si finis sit ut ditescat prae aliis, solum divitiarum causa, vel voluptatis causa, vel eminentiae causa, et similium, est 
finis malus; quare qui ex tali fine credit se proximum esse sibi nocet sibi in aeternum; at si finis sit ut opes sibi comparet necessitatum vitae causa pro se et pro suis, ut in statu sit bonum faciendi 
secundum praecepta doctrinae charitatis, is sibi in aeternum consulit.  Ipse finis facit hominem, nam finis est amor illius; quisque enim pro fine habet quod amat. </p>
