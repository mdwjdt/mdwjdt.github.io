<h4 align="center"></h4><p><strong>665.</strong>“立约”表他会重生。这一点从以下事实明显看出来：主与人之间只有一种圣约，就是凭借爱与信的结合，因此，圣约表示结合。事实上，天堂的婚姻是最为神圣的圣约，天堂的婚姻或结合只存在于那些正在重生之人身上。从最广泛的意义上讲，圣约表示重生本身。当主重生人时，祂就会与人立约。所以，在古人中，圣约并不代表别的。字义给人的印象是，与亚伯拉罕、以撒、雅各布（Jacob），以及多次与他们的后代所立的圣约只牵涉到他们个人，而他们却是无法重生的那类人。因为他们的敬拜仅专注于外在事物，并以为敬拜的外在是神圣的，并没有内在事物与之相连。因此，与他们所立的约仅仅是重生的代表。他们的仪式、亚伯拉罕本人，以及代表爱与信的以撒和雅各布也一样。大祭司和祭司同样如此，无论他们秉性如何，即便是那些恶人也能代表属天和最神圣的祭司。在行代表时，不要关注这个人，而要关注他所代表的事物。因此，以色列和犹大的所有国王，哪怕最坏的那种，也能代表主的王权，甚至让约瑟治理埃及地的法老也可以。从这些及其它很多分析（对此，蒙主慈悲，容后再述）明显可知，如此频繁地与雅各布的众子所立的圣约，无非是具有代表性的宗教仪式。</p>

<p><strong>[NCE]665.</strong> The meaning of setting up a pact as the fact that they would be reborn can be seen clearly from this: No pact can mediate between the Lord and humanity except that of being united by love and faith. So a pact symbolizes union. This kind of union is the heavenly marriage, which is the truest compact. The heavenly marriage, or union, can exist only in those who are reborn, and accordingly a pact in the broadest sense symbolizes rebirth itself. The Lord enters into a compact with us when he regenerates us, and for this reason the ancients saw a pact as representing nothing but regeneration.<br />The literal meaning gives no clue that the covenant made with Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob and so often renewed with their descendants had to do with any others than those actual people. But they were people incapable of rebirth, since they equated worship with outward observances alone. They also saw holiness in external elements without considering any connection to internal values. So the pacts struck with them could do no more than represent regeneration.<br />None of their rituals did more than this. Neither did Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob themselves, who represented different aspects of love and faith. These men were like the priests and high priests, who were able to represent a heavenly and very holy priesthood no matter what their character was — even those who were criminal. When people serve to represent something, no thought is given to their personality, only to the quality represented. By the same token, all the monarchs of Israel and Judah — even the worst ones — represented the Lord's royal power. In fact the pharaoh who raised Joseph up over the land of Egypt also represented that power.<br />This consideration and many others (to be mentioned later, by the Lord's divine mercy) show that the numerous covenants with the children of Jacob were nothing more than rituals that held a representative meaning.{*1} <br /><strong>Footnotes:</strong><br />{*1} For passages that may be the fulfillment of Swedenborg's promise of further discussion of the "other considerations" indicating that covenants with the children of Jacob were representative, see <a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_665/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_1864" target=_top>1864</a> (which says that the covenants represent the Lord's union with Jehovah the Father) and <a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_665/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_2039" target=_top>2039-2042</a>, <a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_665/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_6804#subsection-2-11" target=_top>6804:11</a> (which say that circumcision, as an affirmation of a covenant, represents purification). See also <a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_665/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_2842" target=_top>2842</a>, where covenants sworn by God are described as accommodation to those who do not accept divine truth without such an external representation.

That to "set up a covenant" signifies that he would be regenerated, is very evident from the fact that there can be no covenant between the Lord and man other than conjunction by love and faith, and 
therefore a "covenant" signifies conjunction. For it is the heavenly marriage that is the veriest covenant; and the heavenly marriage, or conjunction, does not exist except with those who are being regenerated; 
so that in the widest sense regeneration itself is signified by a "covenant." The Lord enters into a covenant with man when He regenerates him; and therefore among the ancients a covenant represented 
nothing else. Nothing can be gathered from the sense of the letter but that the covenant with Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob, and so many times with their descendants, was concerned with them personally, 
whereas they were such that they could not be regenerated; for they made worship consist in external things, and supposed the externals of worship to be holy, without internal things being adjoined 
to them. And therefore the covenants made with them were only representatives of regeneration. It was the same with their rites, and with Abraham himself, and with Isaac, and Jacob, who represented 
the things of love and faith. Likewise the high priests and priests, whatever their character, even those that were wicked, could represent the heavenly and most holy priesthood. In representatives 
the person is not regarded, but the thing that is represented. Thus all the kings of Israel and of Judah, even the worst, represented the royalty of the Lord; and even Pharaoh too, who set Joseph 
over the land of Egypt. From these and many other considerations-concerning which, of the Lord's Divine mercy hereafter-it is evident that the covenants so often entered into with the sons of Jacob were 
only religious rites that were representative. </p>

That establishing a covenant' means that he would be regenerated becomes quite clear from the fact that the only kind of covenant that can exist between the Lord and man is conjunction by virtue of love 
and faith. And so a covenant means conjunction; indeed it is the heavenly marriage that is the supreme covenant of all. The heavenly marriage or conjunction does not show itself however except with 
people who are being regenerated. Regeneration itself therefore in the broadest sense is meant by a covenant. The Lord enters into a covenant with man when He regenerates him, and consequently among 
men of old a covenant had no other representation. From the sense of the letter no other impression is gained than that the covenant made with Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob, and so often with their descendants, 
concerned just those personages. But those people were by nature such as to be incapable of being regenerated, for they focused worship exclusively on things that were external, and imagined external 
things to be sacred without things that are internal allied to them. Consequently the covenants made with them were no more than representations of regeneration, as were all their religious ceremonies, 
and as were Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob themselves who represented the things of love and faith. In a similar way priests or high priests, whatever their character, including infamous ones, could 
represent the heavenly and most holy priesthood. In representations no attention is paid to the person who represents but to that which is represented by him. Thus all the kings of Israel and Judah, 
including the worst of them, represented the Lord's kingship, and so indeed did the Pharaoh who promoted Joseph over the land of Egypt. These and many other considerations which in the Lord's Divine 
mercy will be dealt with later on show that the covenants made so often with the sons of Jacob were nothing more than religious ceremonies which were representative. </p>

</p><b>665.</b>
Quod 'erigere foedus' significet quod regeneraretur, manifeste constare potest ex eo quod non aliud foedus intercedere possit inter Dominum et hominem quam conjunctio per amorem et fidem; ita 'foedus' 
significat conjunctionem; est enim conjugium caeleste quod est ipsissimum foedus; conjugium caeleste seu conjunctio non existit nisi apud illos qui regenerantur; ita ipsa regeneratio in latissimo sensu 
significatur per foedus; Dominus 'foedus cum homine init' cum eum regenerat; quare foedus cum antiquis nihil aliud repraesentavit: ex sensu litterae non aliud capitur quam quod foedus cum Abrahamo, 
Isaco et Jacobo, et toties cum posteris eorum pactum, spectet eos; sed ii tales fuerunt ut non regenerari potuerint, nam solum in externis cultum ponebant, et externa sancta putabant, absque quod interna 
adjuncta forent; quare foedera cum iis pacta non erant nisi quam repraesentationes regenerationis; sicut omnes ritus; et sicut ipse Abrahamus, Isacus et Jacobus, qui repraesentabant illa quae sunt 
amoris et fidei; similiter ac pontifices et sacerdotes, qualescumque essent, etiam qui scelesti, repraesentare potuerunt sacerdotium caeleste et sanctissimum; in repraesentationibus nihil reflectitur 
super personam, sed super rem quae repraesentatur; ita omnes reges Israelis et Jehudae, etiam pessimi, repraesentabant regium Domini; immo quoque Pharaoh, qui Josephum super terram Aegypti exaltavit. 
 Inde et ex pluribus aliis, de quibus, ex Divina Domini Misericordia, in sequentibus, constare potest quod foedera toties cum filiis Jacobi pacta nihil fuerint nisi ritualia quae repraesentabant. </p>
