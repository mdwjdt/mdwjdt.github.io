<h3 align="center" class="ired">属天的奥秘 第635节</h3>
<h4 align="center"></h4><p><strong>635.</strong>前节和本节经文表示，在大洪水之前的教会末期，对真理的觉知和对良善的意愿都消失了。大洪水前的人都充满可怖的信念和污秽的欲望，以至于那些良善和真理踪迹全无。但那些被称为“挪亚”之人尚有余留，然而这些余留无法产生属觉知和意愿之物，而只能产生理性真理和属世良善。因为余留的运行取决于人的秉性。这些人能通过余留得以重生。信念不会阻止或吞没主藉着余留的运行，但信念，或根深蒂固的虚假原则会妨碍所有这类运行。除非它们事先被根除，否则人不可能得以重生。蒙主慈悲，这些问题以后再予以论述。</p>

<p><strong>[NCE]635.</strong> The things said in this verse and the last symbolize the impending destruction of all comprehension of truth and all will to do good during the cataclysm of the pre-Flood church. Among the people who had absorbed appalling delusions and foul desires in the times before the Flood, such destruction was so complete that not even a faint impression of those faculties remained visible. But among the people referred to as "Noah," some traces did last. That remnant was not enough to reestablish in them any ability to understand or to will, only to present them with truth on the rational plane and good on the earthly plane. A person's character, you see, determines how fully the remnant can operate. These people had enough remaining traces of intellect and will to enable them to be reborn. Self-deception did not block or swallow up the Lord's operation through the remnant in them.<br />Delusions — false premises that have taken root — hinder the Lord's operation at every turn. Unless they are eradicated, their possessor can never be reborn. More on this later [<a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_635/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_660" target=_top>660-661</a>, <a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_635/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_792" target=_top>792-806</a>], with the Lord's divine mercy. </p>
<p align="center"><b>Potts(1905-1910) 635</b></p><p><b>635.</b>
What is said in the preceding verse and in this signifies that in the end of the days of the antediluvian church all understanding of truth and will of good had perished, so that among the antediluvians 
who were imbued with dreadful persuasions and filthy cupidities not even a vestige appeared. But with those who are called "Noah" there continued to be remains, which however could not bring forth 
anything of understanding and will, but only rational truth and natural good. For the operation of remains is according to the nature of the mad Through remains these people could be regenerated; and 
persuasions did not obstruct and absorb the Lord's operation through remains. Persuasions, or principles of falsity, when rooted in impede all operation; and unless these are first eradicated the man 
can never be regenerated, concerning which subject, of the Lord's Divine mercy hereafter. </p>

<p align="center"><b>Elliott(1983-1999) 635</b></p><p><b>635.</b>
All understanding of truth and will for good perished during the last days of the Church before the Flood. This is meant by what has been stated in the previous and present verses. The people before 
the Flood were so steeped in dreadful persuasions and filthy desires that not one trace of those goods and truths could be seen. But with those called Noah remnants were left, which however were unable 
to produce anything belonging to the understanding or the will, only rational truth and natural good. For a person's character determines what it is that remnants can effect. By means of remnants those 
people were capable of being regenerated. There were no persuasions to thwart or swallow up the Lord's activity by way of remnants. Persuasions, or deep-rooted false assumptions, impede all such activity, 
and unless they are rooted out beforehand a person cannot possibly be regenerated. These matters will in the Lord's Divine mercy be dealt with later on. </p>

</p><b>635.</b>
Quod in fine dierum Ecclesiae antediluvianae perierit omnis intellectus veri et voluntas boni, significatur per illa quae dicta sunt in versu priore, et in hoc; apud antediluvianos qui diris persuasionibus 
et foedis cupiditatibus imbuti erant, ita ut ne quidem aliquod vestigium appareret; sed apud hos qui 'Noahus' appellantur, permanserunt reliquiae, quae tamen non potuerunt sistere aliquod intellectus 
ac voluntatis, sed modo rationale verum et naturale bonum nam qualis homo, talis reliquiarum operatio; per reliquias potuerunt illi regenerari, nec persuasiones obstabant et absorbebant operatione 
Domini per reliquias: persuasiones seu principia falsi radicata impediunt omnem operationem, quae nisi prius exstirpentur, nusquam potest homo regenerari; de quibus, ex Divina Domini Misericordia, 
in sequentibus. </p>
