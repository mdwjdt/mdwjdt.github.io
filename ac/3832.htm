<h3 align="center" class="ired">属天的奥秘 第3832节</h3>
<h4 align="center"></h4><p><strong>3832.</strong>“摆设筵席”表引入。这从“筵席”的含义清楚可知，“筵席”是指归为己有和结合（参看<a href="3596.htm">3596</a>节）。它在此是指引见，因为引入先于结合，是结合的承诺和见证。古时，在那些处于有意义的符号和代表的人当中所摆的筵席无非表示引入相爱，相爱是仁爱的本质。婚筵还表示引入婚姻之爱；神圣的筵席表示引入属灵和属天之爱；这是因为“筵席”或吃喝表示归为己有并结合，如前所示（<a href="3596.htm">3596</a>节）。<br />由于这就是“筵席”的含义，故主所说的也是这个意思：<br />从东从西，将有许多人来，在天国里与亚伯拉罕、以撒、雅各一同坐席。（马太福音<a href="http://39-27.cn/太8.11.htm">8:11</a>）<br />在另一处，主对祂的门徒说：<br />叫你们在我国里，坐在我的席上吃喝。（路加福音<a href="http://39-27.cn/路22.30.htm">22:30</a>）<br />主在设立圣餐时，说：<br />我告诉你们：从今以后我不再喝这葡萄汁，直到我那日子。（马太福音<a href="http://39-27.cn/太26.29.htm">26:29</a>）<br />谁都能看出，“坐在主国里吃喝”不是指坐下又吃又喝，而是指存在于那个国度中的某种事物，是指将爱之良善和信之真理归为己有，因而是指那被称为属灵食物和属天食物的。上述经文还清楚表明，主所说的一切话里面都有内义，若不理解这层内义，人不可能知道“在主国里与亚伯拉罕、以撒、雅各一同坐席，并且在祂父的国里与他们喝葡萄汁”是什么意思。事实上，人也不可能知道圣餐中吃饼和喝酒是什么意思。</p>

<p align="center"><b>Potts(1905-1910) 3832</b></p><p><b>3832.</b>
And made a feast. That this signifies initiation, is evident from the signification of a "feast," as being appropriation and conjunction (see n. 3596); in the present case initiation, because initiation 
precedes conjunction, and likewise pledges and attests it. The feasts made in old times among those who were in significatives and representatives, signified nothing else than initiation into the 
mutual love which is of charity. The nuptial feasts also signified initiation into conjugial love; and the holy feasts, initiation into spiritual and celestial love; and this because feasting, or eating 
and drinking, signified appropriation and conjunction (as shown above, n. 3734). Because of this signification the Lord also said with the same meaning: </p>
<p>     Many shall come from the east and the 
west, and shall sit down with Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob, in the kingdom of the heavens (Matt. 8:11). And in another place, to His disciples: </p>
<p>     That ye may eat and drink at My table in My kingdom 
(Luke 22:30). And when He instituted the Holy Supper, He said: </p>
<p>     I say unto you, that I will not drink henceforth of this fruit of the vine, until that day when I shall drink it new with you in My 
Father's kingdom (Matt. 26:29). Everyone may see that by "sitting down, eating and drinking in the Lord's kingdom," is not signified sitting down, eating, and drinking; but something which exists in 
that kingdom, and is the appropriation of the good of love and the truth of faith; thus it signifies that which is called spiritual and celestial food. It is also manifest from the above words that 
there is an internal sense in all that the Lord spoke, and that without understanding this it cannot be known what it is to sit down with Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob, to eat and drink in the Lord's kingdom 
at His table, and to drink with them of the fruit of that vine in the kingdom of His Father; nay, neither can it be known what is meant by eating bread and drinking wine in the Holy Supper. </p>

'And made a feast' means the introduction. This is clear from the meaning of 'a feast' as making one's own and being joined to, dealt with in <a href="3596.htm">3596</a>. Here it is the introduction, for this precedes the 
joining together, and is a pledge and witness to it. The feasts which were held in early times by people among whom meaningful signs and representatives existed meant nothing else than the introduction 
into the mutual love which is the essence of charity. Wedding feasts meant the introduction into conjugial love, and sacred feasts the introduction into spiritual and celestial love, the reason being 
that 'feasting' or eating and drinking meant making one's own and becoming joined to, as shown in <a href="3596.htm">3596</a>. </p>
<p></p>
<p><b>[2]</b>
 This being the meaning of 'feasts' the Lord also spoke in the same vein, </p>
<blockquote>
Many will come 
from the east and from the west and will recline with Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob in the kingdom of heaven. <a href="http://bible.gospelcom.net/cgi-bin/bible?passage=Matt%208:11&amp;version=ESV&amp;interface=print&amp;showfn=yes&amp;showxref">Matt 8:11</a>. 
</blockquote>
<p>And elsewhere He said to the disciples, </p>
<blockquote>
That you may eat and drink at My 
table in My kingdom. <a href="http://bible.gospelcom.net/cgi-bin/bible?passage=Luke%2022:30&amp;version=ESV&amp;interface=print&amp;showfn=yes&amp;showxref">Luke 22:30</a>. 
</blockquote>
<p>And when He instituted the Holy Supper He said, </p>
<blockquote>
I tell you that I shall not drink from now on of this fruit of the vine until that day when I drink it new with 
you in My Father's kingdom. <a href="http://bible.gospelcom.net/cgi-bin/bible?passage=Matt%2026:29&amp;version=ESV&amp;interface=print&amp;showfn=yes&amp;showxref">Matt 26:29</a>. 
</blockquote>
<p>Anyone may see that 'reclining', 'eating', and 'drinking' in the Lord's kingdom do not mean reclining, eating, and drinking, but the kind of thing that exists 
in that kingdom; that is to say, these experiences are used to mean making the good of love and the truth of faith one's own, and so to mean that which is called spiritual food and celestial food. 
The quotations given above also show plainly that there is an internal sense within words spoken by the Lord, and that without an understanding of that sense one cannot know what is meant by reclining 
with Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob, by eating and drinking at the Lord's table in His kingdom, and by drinking of the fruit of the vine with them in the Father's kingdom. Nor indeed can one know what is 
meant by eating bread and drinking wine in the Holy Supper.  </p>

`Et fecit convivium':  quod significet initiationem, constat a significatione `convivii' quod sit appropriatio et conjunctio, de qua n. 3596, hic initiatio quia haec praecedit conjunctionem, ac spondet 
et testatur eam.  Convivia quae antiquitus fiebant apud illos qui in significativis et repraesentativis fuerunt, non aliud significabant quam  initiationem in amorem mutuum, qui charitatis; 
et convivia nuptialia initiationem in amorem conjugialem, et convivia sancta initiationem in amorem spiritualem et caelestem, et hoc ex causa quia per `convivari' seu `comedere et bibere' significabatur appropriatio 
et conjunctio, ut n. {2}3596 ostensum est; [2]quia haec significabantur, etiam Dominus in tali sensu dixit,      Quod multi ab oriente usque et occidente venient, et accumbent  
    cum Abrahamo, Isaco et Jacobo, in regno caelorum  Matth. viii      11: </p>
<p>et alibi ad discipulos,       Ut comedatis et bibatis super mensa Mea in regno Meo, Luc.      xxii 30: </p>
<p>et cum instituit 
Sanctam Cenam, dixit,      Dico vobis quod non bibiturus sim a nunc ex hoc genimine vitis      usque ad diem {3}illum, quando id bibero vobiscum novum in      regno Patris Mei, Matth. xxvi 29; </p>
<p>quisque 
videre potest quod per `accumbere, comedere, et bibere in regno Domini' non significetur accumbere, comedere, et bibere, sed quod tale quod ibi est, nempe {4}quod appropriatio boni amoris et veri 
fidei per illa intelligatur, ita quod illud quod cibus spiritualis et cibus caelestis vocatur; manifeste quoque ex illis verbis patet quod sensus internus illis quae Dominus locutus est, insit, 
et quod absque intellectu ejus non sciri possit {5}quid sit cum Abrahamo, Isaco et Jacobo accumbere, super mensa in regno Domini comedere et bibere, et ex genimine illius vitae cum illis bibere in 
regno Patris; immo nec sciri possit quid per comedere panem et bibere vinum in Sancta Cena {6}intelligatur. @1 i dicitur$ @2 The number here referred to seems to be the last cited, viz. 3596, as 
a comparison will show.  AI have 3134.  Possibly 3734 was intended.$ @3 illam as Sch.$ @4 bonum amoris et verum fidei, et quod eorum appropriatio$ @5 quid foret quod cum Abrahamo, Jischako et Jacobo 
accumberent, quod super mensa Domini in Regno Ipsius comederent et biberent, et quod Dominus ex illo genimine vitis cum illis biberet novum in Regno Patris sui; proinde nec sciri posset$ @6 intelligitur$ </p>
