<h3 align="center" class="ired">属天的奥秘 第3416节</h3>
<h4 align="center"></h4><p><strong>3416.</strong>“以撒就离开那里”表主舍弃内层真理。这从“离开那里”的含义和“以撒”的代表清楚可知：“离开那里”是指舍弃，在此是指舍弃内层真理，因为这些真理就是此处所论述的主题；“以撒”是指主的神圣理性。主舍弃内层真理，意味着祂没有向具有这种秉性的人透露它们。圣言处处含有内在真理，但诸如拥有认知的记忆知识，同时却不关注生活的人在阅读圣言时，却看不到这些真理。这一点从以下事实明显看出来：那些视信为救恩本质的人根本没有注意到主多次提到有关爱与仁的事（<a href="1017.htm">1017</a>，<a href="2371.htm">2371</a>节）。而那些注意到的人却称它们为信的果子，他们这些果子与仁爱区分开，甚至分离开来，根本就不知道这果子的性质。因此，显现给他们的是圣言中在后面的事物，而非在前面的事物，也就是外层事物，而非内层事物。看到在后或外层之物，却看不到在前或内层之物，等于根本没有看到任何神性之物。这就是“以撒就离开那里”所表示的“主舍弃内层真理”这一解释的含义。不是主舍弃他们，而是那些人因远离生活事务而远离主。 </p>

<p align="center"><b>Potts(1905-1910) 3416</b></p><p><b>3416.</b>
And Isaac departed thence. That this signifies that the Lord left interior truths, is evident from the signification of "departing thence," as being to leave; here, to leave interior truths, because 
these are here treated of; and from the representation of Isaac, as being the Lord as to the Divine rational. That the Lord leaves interior truths, signifies that He does not open them to persons of such 
a character; for there are everywhere in the Word internal truths; but such persons as are in the memory-knowledge of knowledges, and not at the same time in life, do not when reading the Word even 
see these truths; as is evident from the fact that they who make faith the essential of salvation do not attend to those things which the Lord so frequently spoke concerning love and charity (n. 1017, 
2371); and they who do attend, call such things the fruits of faith, which fruits they thus distinguish, nay, separate, from charity, of the nature of which they are ignorant. Thus the posterior things 
of the Word appear to them, but not the anterior things; that is, the exterior things, but not the interior; and to see what is posterior or exterior without seeing what is anterior or interior is 
to see nothing of the Divine. This is what is meant by the Lord's leaving interior truths, which is signified by Isaac's departing thence; not that the Lord leaves them, but that they remove themselves 
from the Lord, because from those things which are of life. </p>

'And Isaac went away from there' means that the Lord abandoned interior truths. This is clear from the meaning of 'going away from there' as abandoning, here abandoning interior truths since these are 
the subject; and from the representation of 'Isaac' as the Lord's Divine Rational. The Lord's abandonment of interior truths means that He does not expose these to such persons. Every part of the Word 
contains internal truths, but when such people read the Word as possess a knowledge of cognitions but are not at the same time concerned with life they do not even notice those truths, as becomes clear 
from the fact that those who make the essential thing of salvation to reside in faith pay no attention at all to those things which the Lord spoke of so many times regarding love and charity, <a href="1017.htm">1017</a>, <a href="2371.htm">2371</a>. And those who do pay any attention to them call them the fruits of faith, which they distinguish and indeed separate from charity, the nature of which is not known to them. Thus the things of 
the Word that are secondary are seen by them but not those that are primary, that is, its exterior features are seen but not the interior ones. And seeing the things that are secondary or exterior without 
those that are primary or interior amounts to seeing nothing Divine at all. These are the implications of the explanation that the Lord abandoned interior truths, meant by 'Isaac went away from 
there'. Not that the Lord abandons, but that those people remove themselves from the Lord by removing themselves from matters of life. </p>

`Et ivit abinde Jishak': quod significet quod Dominus vera interiora relinqueret, constat ex significatione `ire abinde' quod sit relinquere, hic vera interiora quia de illis agitur; et ex repraesentatione 
`Jishaki' quod sit Dominus quoad Divinum Rationale. Quod Dominus {2}relinquat vera interiora, significat quod illa non aperiat illis: sunt enim in Verbo ubivis vera interna, sed tales qui in scientia 
cognitionum sunt et non simul in vita, {3}cum Verbum legunt, vera illa ne quidem vident; ut {4}constare potest ex eo quod illi qui essentiale salutis ponunt in fide, ne quidem attendant ad illa 
quae Dominus toties locutus est de {5}amore et charitate, n. 1017, (x)2371; et qui attendunt, vocant illa fructus fidei quos a charitate, quam ignorant qualis sit, sic distinguunt, immo separant; ita 
posteriora Verbi illis apparent, non autem anteriora, hoc est, exteriora non interiora; et posteriora aut exteriora videre, absque anterioribus seu interioribus, est nihil Divini videre: haec sunt quae 
intelliguntur per quod Dominus vera interiora reliquerit, quod significatur per quod `ivit abinde Jishak'; non quod Dominus relinquat, sed quod illi se a Domino, quia ab illis quae sunt vitae, removent. @1
