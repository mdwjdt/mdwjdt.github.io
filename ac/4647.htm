Verses 15-19. These are the chiefs of the sons of Esau; the sons of Eliphaz the firstborn of Esau; chief Teman, chief Omar, chief Zepho, chief Kenaz, chief Korah, chief Gatam, chief Amalek. These are 
the chiefs of Eliphaz in the land of Edom; these are the sons of Adah. And these are the sons of Reuel Esau's son; chief Nahath, chief Zerah, chief Shammah, chief Mizzah; these are the chiefs of Reul 
in the land of Edom; these are the sons of Basemath Esau's wife. And these are the sons of Oholibamah Esau's wife; chief Jeush, chief Jalam, chief Korah: these are the chiefs of Oholibamah the daughter 
of Anah, Esau's wife. These are the sons of Esau, and these are their chiefs: he himself is Edom. "These are the chiefs of the sons of Esau," signifies the principal truths of good; "the sons of Eliphaz, 
the firstborn of Esau; chief Teman, chief Omar, chief Zepho, chief Kenaz, chief Korah, chief Gatam, chief Amalek," signifies the first classification, and their quality, and of what quality they 
are also in the Lord's kingdom; "these are the chiefs of Eliphaz in the land of Edom, these are the sons of Adah," signifies the principal truths of the first class; "and these are the sons of Reuel 
Esau's son; chief Nahath, chief Zerah, chief Shammah, chief Mizzah," signifies a second class, and their quality, as in heaven; "these are the chiefs of Reuel in the land of Edom," signifies a second 
classification; "these are the sons of Basemath Esau's wife," signifies from the marriage of good and truth; "and these are the sons of Oholibamah Esau's wife," signifies the principal truths of a third 
classification; "chief Jeush, chief Jalam, chief Horah," signifies their quality, and hence what is their quality in the Lord's kingdom; "these are the chiefs of Oholibamah the daughter of Anah, Esau's 
wife" signifies the principal truths arising from the conjunction of good and truth; these twelve chiefs are as the twelve tribes, according to their disposal by good; "these are the sons of Esau, 
and these are their chiefs," signifies that these are the principal of the truths of good; "he himself is Edom," signifies in the Lord's Divine Human. </p>
