It is said "love to God," and there is meant love to the Lord, because in Him is the Trinity, and He is the Lord of heaven, for He has "all power in heaven and on earth" (Matt. 28:18).            EXODUS 
5 </p>
<p>     1. And afterward Moses and Aaron came, and said unto Pharaoh, Thus said Jehovah the God of Israel, Let My people go, that they may hold a feast to Me in the wilderness.      2. And Pharaoh 
said, Who is Jehovah, whose voice I should hear, to let Israel go? I know not Jehovah, and also I will not let Israel go.      3. And they said, The God of the Hebrews hath met with us; let us 
go, we pray, a way of three days into the wilderness, and let us sacrifice to Jehovah our God; lest He fall upon us with pestilence, or with the sword.      4. And the king of Egypt said unto them, Wherefore 
do ye, Moses and Aaron, draw away the people from their works? Go ye unto your burdens.      5. And Pharaoh said, Behold the people of the land are now many, and ye have made them cease from 
their burdens.      6. And Pharaoh commanded in that day the taskmasters in the people, and their officers, saying,       7. Ye shall no more give the people straw to make bricks, as yesterday, and 
the day before yesterday; let them go and gather straw for themselves.      8. And the tale of the bricks which they made yesterday and the day before yesterday, ye shall lay upon them; ye shall not 
take away from it; for they are idle; therefore they cry, saying, Let us go and sacrifice to our God.      9. Let the service be made heavier upon the men, and let them do it; and let them not regard 
the words of a lie.      10. And the taskmasters of the people went out, and their officers, and they spoke to the people, saying, Thus said Pharaoh, I will by no means give you straw.      11. Go 
ye yourselves, get you straw where ye can find it; for nothing whatever shall be taken away from your service.      12. And the people scattered into all the land of Egypt to gather stubble for straw.  
    13. And the taskmasters were urgent, saying, Complete ye your works, the work of a day in its day, as when there was straw.      14. And the officers of the sons of Israel were beaten, whom 
Pharaoh's taskmasters had set over them, saying, Wherefore do ye not complete your task in making brick, as yesterday and the day before yesterday, also yesterday, also today?      15. And the officers 
of the sons of Israel came and cried unto Pharaoh, saying, Wherefore doest thou so to thy servants?      16. There is no straw given to thy servants, and they say to us, Make ye bricks; and behold 
thy servants are beaten; and thy people have sinned.      17. And he said, Ye are idle, ye are idle; therefore ye say, Let us go and sacrifice to Jehovah.      18. And now go ye, serve ye, and straw 
shall not be given you, and the tale of bricks shall ye give.      19. And the officers of the sons of Israel saw that they were in evil when it was said, Ye shall not take away from your bricks on 
a day in its day.      20. And they met Moses and Aaron standing to meet them as they went forth from Pharaoh.      21. And they said unto them, Jehovah look upon you, and judge, because ye have made 
our odor to stink in the eyes of Pharaoh, and in the eyes of his servants, to put a sword into their hand to slay us.      22. And Moses returned unto Jehovah, and said, Lord, wherefore hast Thou 
done evilly to this people? Why is this that Thou hast sent me?      23. For since I came unto Pharaoh to speak in Thy name, he hath done evilly to this people; and liberating Thou hast not liberated 
Thy people. </p>

Amor in Deum dicitur, et intelligitur amor in Dominum, {1}quia in Ipso est Trinitas, et Ille est Dominus caeli, nam Ipsi est omnis potestas in caelo et in terra, Matth. xxviii 18. {1}CAPUT V @1 i 
Exodi$ 	1.  Et postea venerunt Moscheh et Aharon, et dixerunt ad Pharaonem, Ita dixit JEHOVAH, DEUS Israelis, Dimitte populum Meum, et festum agant Mihi in deserto. 	2.  Et dixit Pharao, Quis JEHOVAH 
Cujus audiam vocem, ad dimittendum Israelem? non novi JEHOVAM, et etiam Israelem non dimittam. 	3.  Et dixerunt, DEUS Hebraeorum occurrit nobis; eamus quaeso viam trium dierum in desertum, et sacrificemus 
JEHOVAE DEO nostro, ne forte incidat in nos peste {1}et gladio. 	@1 vel$ 	4.  Et dixit ad illos rex Aegypti, Quare, Mosche et Aharon, abstrahitis populum ab operibus ejus? ite ad onera vestra. 	5. 
 Et dixit Pharao, Ecce multi nunc populus terrae, et cessare fecistis illos ab oneribus illorum. 	6.  Et praecepit Pharao die illo exactoribus in populo et moderatoribus ejus, dicendo, 	7. 
 Non addetis dare paleam populo ad laterificandum lateres, sicut heri nudius tertius, illi ibunt et colligant sibi paleam. 	8.  Et demensum laterum quod illi facientes heri nudius tertius, ponetis super 
illos, non detrahetis ab illo, quia remissi illi, propterea illi clamant, dicendo, Eamus, sacrificemus DEO nostro. 	9.  Aggravetur servitium super viros, et faciant illud, et ne respiciant ad verba 
mendacii. 	10.  Et exiverunt exactores populi, et moderatores ejus, et dixerunt ad populum, dicendo, Ita dixit Pharao, Nequaquam do vobis paleam. 	11.  Vos ite, sumite vobis paleam, ex quo inveneritis, 
quia nihil detrahetur e servitio vestro quicquam. 	12.  Et dispersit se populus in omnem terram Aegypti ad colligendum (x)stipulam ad paleam. 	13.  Et exactores urgentes, dicendo, Absolvite opera 
vestra, verbum diei in die ejus, quemadmodum in esse palea. 	14.  Et percussi sunt moderatores filiorum Israelis, quos posuerunt super illos exactores Pharaonis, dicendo, Quare non absolvitis statutum 
vestrum ad laterificandum sicut heri nudius tertius, etiam heri, etiam hodie? 	15.  Et venerunt moderatores filiorum Israelis, et clamaverunt ad Pharaonem, dicendo, Quare facis sic servis tuis? 	16. 
Palea nulla datur servis tuis, et lateres, dicunt nobis, Facite, et ecce servi tui percutiuntur; et peccavit populus tuus. 	17. Et dixit, Remissi vos, remissi, propterea vos dicitis, Eamus: sacrificemus 
JEHOVAE. 	18.  Et nunc ite, servite, et palea non dabitur vobis, et demensum laterum dabitis. 	19.  Et viderunt moderatores filiorum Israelis semet in malo, dicendo, Non detrahetis de lateribus 
vestris quicquam die in die ejus. 	20.  Et occurrerunt Moschi et Aharoni stantibus obviam illis in exire illos a Pharaone. 	21.  Et dixerunt ad illos, Videat JEHOVAH super vos, et judicet, quod 
putere fecistis odorem nostrum in oculis Pharaonis, et in oculis servorum illius, ad dandum gladium in manum illorum ad occidendum nos. 	22.  Et reversus Moscheh ad JEHOVAM, et dixit, DOMINE, quare 
malefecisti populo huic? quare hoc, misisti me? 	23.  Et ex quo veni ad Pharaonem ad loquendum in nomine Tuo, malefecit populo isti, et liberando non liberasti populum Tuum. </p>
