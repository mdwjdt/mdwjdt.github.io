<h3 align="center" class="ired">属天的奥秘 第3677节</h3>
<h4 align="center"></h4><p><strong>3677.</strong>“拉班是雅各以扫的母亲利百加的哥哥”表经由“雅各”所代表的真理良善和“以扫”所代表的良善真理的母亲而来的姻亲关系。这从“利百加”、“雅各”和“以扫”的代表清楚可知：“利百加”是指主的神圣理性的神性真理，如前面频繁所述；“雅各”是指真理的良善，或源于属世层里面的真理的良善；“以扫”是指良善的真理，或属世层里面的真理所源于的良善（参看<a href="3669.htm">3669</a>节）。由于属世人或外在人中的一切良善与真理都是从理性人或内在人孕育和生出的，也就是说，从如同父亲的理性层的良善和如同母亲的理性层的真理孕育和生出的（<a href="3314.htm">3314</a>，<a href="3573.htm">3573</a>，<a href="3616.htm">3616</a>节），所以上面这句话表示经由“雅各”所代表的真理良善和“以扫”所代表的良善真理的母亲而来的姻亲关系。这正是它们彼此关系的写照。<br />不过，要理性解释这些事是极为困难的。原因在于，就连关于这个问题最一般的事实如今都不为人知，如：何为属灵良善及其真理，良善及其真理有数不清的属，更有数不清的种，还有它们通过层级彼此结合，就像血亲关系和姻亲关系的结合一样。既然这些最一般的事都不为人知，那么对这些层级和关系的描述根本不会清楚，尤其是现在，因为当今学者都不愿知道这些事。他们喜欢停留在这些问题的表面，不去讨论它们的性质，而是争论它们是否存在。只要处于这种状态，他们根本就不想去知道关于这无数种良善与真理的任何事。</p>

The brother of Rebekah, the mother of Jacob and Esau. That this signifies the affinity from the mother with the good of truth which is "Jacob" and with the truth of good which is "Esau," is evident from 
the representation of Rebekah, as being the Lord's Divine rational as to Divine truth (of which frequently above); and from the representation of Jacob, as being the good of truth, or the good which 
is from truth in the natural; and from the representation of Esau, as being the truth of good, or the good from which is truth in the natural (see above, n. 3669). And because all the goods and truths 
that are in the natural or external man are conceived and born of the rational or internal man; that is, of the good of the rational as a father, and of the truth thereof as a mother (n. 3314, 3573, 
3616), therefore by the above words is signified the affinity from the mother with the good of truth which is "Jacob" and with the truth of good which is "Esau." [2] Moreover they are circumstanced 
in precisely the same way; but to explain these things to the apprehension is very difficult, because even the most general facts in regard to the subject are at this day unknown-as for instance, what 
spiritual good is and what its truth, and that there are innumerable genera of good and its truth, and still more innumerable species, also that they are conjoined with each other by degrees as it 
were of consanguinity and affinity. These most general things being unknown, a description of the degrees and affinities would fall into mere shade, and the more so because the learned of the day do not 
desire to know such things, for they love to stray in the mere shell; and to dispute, not concerning the quality of such things, but whether they exist or not; and so long as they are in this state 
they desire to know nothing whatever concerning these innumerable kinds of good and truth. </p>

'The brother of Rebekah, Jacob and Esau's mother' means the relationship through the mother of the good of truth, represented by 'Jacob', with the truth of good, represented by 'Esau'. This is clear 
from the representation of 'Rebekah' as the Lord's Divine Rational as regards Divine Truth, often dealt with already, from the representation of 'Jacob' as the good of truth, or good which springs from 
truth in the natural, and from the representation of 'Esau' as the truth of good, or good from which truth springs in the natural, dealt with above in <a href="3669.htm">3669</a>. And seeing that all goods and truths which 
exist in the natural or external man are conceived and born from the rational or internal man, that is to say, from the good of the rational as the father, and from the truth of the rational as the 
mother, <a href="3314.htm">3314</a>, <a href="3573.htm">3573</a>, <a href="3616.htm">3616</a>, those words therefore mean a relationship through the mother of the good of truth, represented by 'Jacob', with the truth of good, represented by 'Esau'. This is exactly how 
they are related to one another. </p>
<p></p>
<p><b>[2]</b>
 But to explain these things intelligibly is extremely difficult, the reason being that the most general features of this matter are not known at the present day, 
such as what spiritual good is and what the truth that goes with it is, and that there are countless genera of good and accompanying truth, and still more countless species, and also that there are 
degrees of them which are interconnected like those of blood relationships and relationships by marriage. While these very general features remain unknown a description of degrees and relationships would 
not be at all clear to anyone, especially at the present day when the learned have no wish to know those things. For these do not like to go beneath the surface of these matters and discuss the nature 
of them, only whether they exist or not. And as long as that is their state they have no wish at all to know anything about those countless kinds of good and truth. </p>

</p><b>3677.</b>
`Fratrem Rebeccae matris Jacobi et Esavi':  quod significet affinitatem ex matre cum bono veri quod `Jacob,' cum boni vero quod `Esau,' constat ex repraesentatione `Rebeccae' quod sit Divinum Rationale 
Domini quoad Divinum Verum, de qua saepius prius; ex repraesentatione `Jacobi' quod sit bonum veri seu bonum quod ex vero in naturali; et ex repraesentatione `Esavi' quod sit boni verum, seu bonum 
es quo verum in naturali, de quibus supra n. 3669; et quia omnia bona et vera quae sunt in naturali seu externo homine, concipiuntur et nascuntur a rationali seu interno homine, nempe a bono rationalis 
ut a patre, et a vero rationalis ut a matre n. 3314, 3573, 3616, ideo per illa verba significatur affinitas ex matre cum bono veri quod `Jacob,' cum boni vero quod `Esau'; se quoque prorsus similiter 
habent; [2] sed explicare illa ad captum, perquam difficile est, ex causa quia communissima hujus rei hodie ignota sunt, sicut quid bonum spirituale, et quid verum ejus, et quod innumerabilia genera 
boni et veri ejus sint, et adhuc innumerabiliores species, tum quod per gradus quasi consanguinitatis et affinitatis inter se conjuncta sint; haec quae communissima, cum ignota sunt, descriptio graduum 
et affinitatum in meras umbras caderet; et eo adhuc magis quia docti hodie nec scire illa volunt, amant enim solum in cortice errare, et disceptare non qualia sunt, sed num sint, et quamdiu in illo 
statu sunt, nihil prorsus scire volunt de innumerabilibus illis. </p>
