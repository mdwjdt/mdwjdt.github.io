<h3 align="center" class="ired">属天的奥秘 第5596节</h3>
<h4 align="center"></h4><p><strong>5596.</strong>“你们为什么这样害我，告诉那人你们还有个兄弟呢”表他们将良善之真理与属灵良善分离，以便将它与来自内在的属灵层联结。这从“害”和“告诉”的含义，以及“约瑟”和“便雅悯”的代表清楚可知：“害”是指分离，因为他们将便雅悯与以色列分离，以色列称之为“害”；“告诉”是指给予别人某种东西以便思考和反思（<a href="2862.htm">2862</a>，<a href="5508.htm">5508</a>节），因而是指交流（参看<a href="4856.htm">4856</a>节），因而也是指结合，因为当有东西进入别人的意愿时，结合就会通过交流实现，如当约瑟听说便雅悯仍活着，与他父亲同在时，就想让便雅悯来见他，然后单独与他在一起，与他结合，这从接下来的历史明显可知；“约瑟”是指神性属灵层，当被称为“那人”时，是指来自内在的属灵层（<a href="5584.htm">5584</a>节）；“便雅悯”，即此处他们的兄弟，他们曾告诉约瑟便雅悯的存在，是指良善之真理（<a href="5586.htm">5586</a>节）。由此明显可知，“你们为什么这样害我，告诉那人你们还有个兄弟呢”表示他们将良善之真理与属灵良善分离，以便将它与来自内在的属灵层联结。</p>

Wherefore dealt ye ill with me, to tell the man whether ye had yet a brother? That this signifies that they separated from them. the truth of good, to conjoin it with the spiritual from the internal, 
is evident from the signification of "dealing ill," as being to separate, for it is their separating Benjamin from him that he calls "dealing ill;" and from the signification of "telling," as being to 
give something for another to think and reflect upon (n. 2862, 5508), consequently to communicate (see n. 4856), thus also to conjoin; for when anything passes into the will of another, conjunction 
is effected by what is communicated, as when Joseph heard that Benjamin was still living and with his father, he wanted him to come to him, and then to be alone with him, conjoined with him, as is plain 
from the historicals that follow; and from the representation of Joseph, as being the Divine spiritual, and as being, when called "the man," the spiritual from the internal (n. 5584); and from the 
representation of Benjamin, who is here their brother of whom they told, as being the truth of good (n. 5586). From all this it is plain that by "Wherefore dealt ye ill with me to tell the man whether 
ye had yet a brother?" is signified that they separated from them the truth of good, to conjoin it with the spiritual from the internal. </p>

<p align="center"><b>Elliott(1983-1999) 5596</b></p><p><b>5596.</b>
'Why did you treat me so badly as to tell the man that you had still [another] brother?' means that they separated the truth of good from spiritual good, so as to join it to the spiritual from the internal. 
This is clear from the meaning of 'treating badly' as separating, for it is their separation of Benjamin from him that Israel calls 'treating badly'; and from the meaning of 'telling' or 'pointing 
out' as imparting knowledge about what another thinks and reflects on, <a href="2862.htm">2862</a>, <a href="5508.htm">5508</a>, consequently communicating, <a href="4856.htm">4856</a>, and therefore joining together too (for when what is imparted passes into another's 
will, that communication leads to a joining together, as when Joseph heard that Benjamin was still alive and present with his father, he wanted Benjamin to come to him, and then, when alone with 
him, wanted to be joined to him, as is evident from the historical details that come after this); from the representation of Joseph as the Divine Spiritual, who, when he is called 'the man', means the 
spiritual from the internal, dealt with in <a href="5584.htm">5584</a>; and from the representation of Benjamin - to whom their brother, whose existence they had told him about, refers here - as the truth of good, dealt with 
in <a href="5586.htm">5586</a>. From all this it is evident that 'why did you treat me so badly as to tell the man that you had still [another] brother?' means that they separated the truth of good from spiritual good, 
so as to join it to the spiritual from the internal. </p>

`Quare male fecistis mihi, ad indicandum viro an adhuc {1}frater ?': quod significet quod separarent a se verum boni ad conjungendum illud spirituali ab interno, constat ex significatione `malefacere' 
quod sit separare, nam quod separarent ab illo Benjaminem, est quod vocat `malefacere'; ex significatione `indicare' quod sit dare quod alter cogitet et super quod reflectat, n. 2862, 5508,  proinde 
communicare, n. (x)4856, inde est etiam conjungere, nam cum transit in voluntatem alterius, fit ex communicato conjunctio, sicut cum Josephus audivit quod Benjamin adhuc viveret et esset apud patrem 
suum, quod vellet ut ad se veniret, et dein quod solus apud se esset sibi conjunctus, ut patet ab historicis quae sequuntur; ex repraesentatione `Josephi' quod sit Divinum Spirituale, qui cum `vir' vocatur, 
quod sit spirituale ab interno, de qua n. 5584; et a repraesentatione `Benjaminis', qui hic est frater eorum de quo indicaverunt, quod sit {2}verum boni, de qua n. 5586; ex his patet quod per 
`quare malefecistis mihi ad indicandum viro an adhuc frater?' significetur quod separarent a se verum boni ad conjungendum illud spirituali ab interno. @1 see p. 217,ft. I $ @2 bonum veri A I, but see
