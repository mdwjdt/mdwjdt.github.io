<h4 align="center"></h4><p><strong>10467</strong>.出埃及记32:21-25.摩西对亚伦说，这百姓向你作了什么？你竟给他们带来这么大的罪。亚伦说，求我主不要使你的怒气发热；你知道这百姓，他们是专于作恶的。他们对我说，你为我们造神明，可以走在我们前头；因为这摩西，就是领我们从埃及地上来的那人，我们不知道他遭了什么事。我对他们说，凡有金子的，都可以摘下来，他们就给了我；我把它扔在火中，这牛犊便出来了。摩西见百姓放肆，因为亚伦使他们如此放肆，以致起来反对他们的人要消灭他们；<br />“摩西对亚伦说”表对于这种外在，来自内在的觉察。“这百姓向你作了什么？你竟给他们带来这么大的罪”表这个民族为何如此背离神性？“亚伦说”表所觉察到的东西。“求我主不要使你的怒气发热”表不让内在因此背离。“你知道这百姓，他们是专于作恶的”表这个民族的兴趣在于与神圣的内在之物分离的外在之物。“他们对我说”表劝告。“你为我们造神明，可以走在我们前头”表教义和敬拜的虚假，因而偶像崇拜的东西。“因为这摩西，就是领我们从埃及地上来的那人，我们不知道他遭了什么事”表完全不知道有什么其它神性真理存在于圣言中，它会把人从一个外在层面提升到一个内在层面，并构成教会。“我对他们说，凡有金子的，都可以摘下来”表从圣言的字义中抽取诸如支持属于外在的爱和由这些爱所产生的主要观念的快乐的那类事物。“他们就给了我”表聚成一体并付诸实施。“我把它扔在火中，这牛犊便出来了”表自我之爱和尘世之爱，这种敬拜就源于并符合这两种爱。“摩西见百姓放肆”表内在发觉这个民族背离内在之物，从而背离神性。“因为亚伦使他们如此放肆”表他们所爱的外在事物是这一切的原因。“以致起来反对他们的人要消灭他们”表他们没有任何能力来抵制来自地狱的邪恶和虚假。</p>

Verses 21-25. And Moses said unto Aaron, What did this people to thee, that thou hast brought so great a sin upon them? And Aaron said, Let not thine anger wax hot, my lord; thou knowest the people, 
that it is in evil; and they said unto me, Make us gods which shall go before us; for as for this Moses, the man that made us come up out of the land of Egypt, we know not what hath become of him. And 
I said to them, Whosoever hath any gold, tear ye it off; and they gave it me; and I cast it into the fire, and there came out this calf. And Moses saw that the people was lax, for Aaron had made them 
lax unto annihilation by those rising up against them. "And Moses said unto Aaron," signifies perception from the internal concerning such an external; "What did this people to thee, that thou hast brought 
so great a sin upon them?" signifies whence is it that this nation has so turned itself away from the Divine; "and Aaron said," signifies that it was perceived; "Let not thine anger wax hot, my 
lord," signifies let not the internal turn itself away on this account; "thou knowest the people, that it is in evil," signifies that that nation is in an external separate from a holy internal; "and 
they said unto me," signifies exhortation; "Make us gods which shall go before us," signifies falsities of doctrine and of worship, thus things idolatrous; "for as for this Moses, the man that made us 
come up out of the land of Egypt, we know not what hath become of him," signifies that it is altogether unknown what other Divine truth there is in the Word, which raises man from what is external to 
what is internal, and makes the church; "and I said to them, whosoever hath any gold, tear ye it off," signifies the drawing forth of such things from the sense of the letter as favor the delight of 
external loves and the principles thence derived; "and they gave it to me," signifies a bringing together into a one, and the effect; "and I cast it into the fire, and there came out this calf," signifies 
the loves of self and of the world, from which and according to which is such worship; "and Moses saw the people that it was lax," signifies that it was perceived by the internal that that nation 
had turned away from what is internal, thus from the Divine; "for Aaron had made them lax," signifies that this was from the external things which they loved; "unto annihilation by those rising up against 
them," signifies that they lacked all power to resist the evils and falsities which are from hell. </p>

Verses 21-25  And Moses said to Aaron, What did this people do to you that you have brought so great a sin upon them? And Aaron said, Do not let your anger grow hot, O my lord; you know the people, that 
they [are set] on evil. And they said to me, Make us gods to go before us; for this Moses, that man who caused us to come up out of the land of Egypt, we do not know what has become of him. And I 
said to them, Whoever has gold, pull it away; and they gave it to me, and I threw it into the fire, and this calf came out. And Moses saw that the people had become undisciplined; for Aaron had caused 
them to become so undisciplined that those rising up against them would annihilate them<A name="fntext1"></a><A href="#fn1"><sup>a</sup></a>. </p>
<p>'And Moses said to Aaron' means perception from the internal regarding that kind of external. 'What did this 
people do to you that you have brought so great a sin upon them?' means, Why is it that that nation has so turned itself away from the Divine? 'And Aaron said' means what was perceived. 'Do not let 
your anger grow hot, O my lord' means, Do not let the internal therefore turn itself away. 'You know the people, that they [are set] on evil' means that that nation's interest lies in what is external 
separated from what is holy and internal. 'And they said to me' means exhortation. 'Make us gods to go before us' means falsities contained in teachings and worship, thus things of an idolatrous nature. 
'For this Moses, that man who caused us to come up out of the land of Egypt, we do not know what has become of him' means a total unawareness of what other Divine Truth exists in the Word that raises 
a person from an external level to an internal level and makes the Church. 'And I said to them, Whoever has gold, pull it away' means drawing out of the literal sense [of the Word] such things as 
are favourable to the delight belonging to external kinds of love and to the major ideas resulting from these. 'And they gave it to me' means bringing together into one, and putting into effect. 'And 
I threw it into the fire, and this calf came out' means self-love and love of the world, from which that worship sprang and with which it accorded. 'And Moses saw that the people had become undisciplined' 
means that the internal perceived that this nation had turned away from what was internal and so from what was Divine. 'For Aaron had caused them to become so undisciplined' means that the external 
things which they loved were the cause of this. 'That those rising up against them would annihilate them' means being left without any power to withstand evils and falsities that come from hell.

Vers. 21-25. Et dixit Moscheh ad Aharonem, Quid fecit tibi populus hic quod adduxeris super illum peccatum tam magnum? Et dixit Aharon, Ne exardescat ira, domine mi; tu nosti populum quod in malo ille; 
et dixerunt mihi, Fac nobis deos qui eant ante nos, quia hic Moscheh ille vir qui ascendere fecit nos e terra Aegypti, non scimus quid sit ei; et dixi illis, Cui aurum, avellite; et dederunt mihi, 
et projeci illud in ignem, et exivit vitulus hic. Et vidit Moscheh populum quod dissolutus ille, quia dissolutum fecit illum Aharon ad annihilationem insurgentibus illorum. {1}Et dixit Moscheh ad Aharonem 
significat perceptionem ab interno de externo tali: `Quid fecit tibi populus hic quod adduxeris super illum peccatum tam magnum?' significat unde hoc quod gens illa ita se averterit a Divino: `et 
dixit Aharon' significat perceptum: `ne exardescat ira, domine mi' significat ne ideo avertat se internum: `tu nosti populum quod in malo ille' significat quod gens illa in externo sit separato a sancto 
interno: `et dixerunt mihi' significat exhortationem: `Fac nobis deos qui eant ante nos' significat falsa doctrinae et cultus, ita idololatrica: `quia hic Moscheh ille vir qui ascendere fecit nos 
e terra Aegypti, non scimus quid sit ei' significat quod prorsus ignotum sit, quid Divinum Verum in Verbo aliud quod elevat hominem ab externo in internum et facit Ecclesiam: `et dixi illis, Cui aurum, 
avellite,  significat extractionem talium ex sensu litterae [Verbi] quae favent jucundo amorum externorum, ac principiis inde: `et dederunt mihi' significat collationem in unum, et effectum: `et projeci 
illud in ignem, et exivit vitulus hic' significat amores sui et mundi, ex quibus et secundum {2}quos cultus ille: `et vidit Moscheh populum quod dissolutus ille' significat perceptum ab interno 
quod gens illa aversa esset ab interno, ita a Divino: `quia dissolutum fecit illum Aharon' significat quod hoc ab externis quae amabant: `ad annihilationem insurgentibus illorum' significat absque omni 
potentia resistendi malis et falsis quae ab inferno. @1 See p. ix preliminary note 2. 21.  Et dixit Moscheh ad Aharonem, significat perceptionem ex interno Verbi de externo tali: quid fecit tibi populus 
hic, quod adduxeris super illum peccatum tam malum, significat unde hoc quod ita se averterit a Divino.    22.  Et dixit Aharon, significat responsum: ne ardescat Ira Domini [domini intended mei, 
significat ne ideo se avertat internum: tu nosti populum quod in malo ille, significat quod gens illa in externo separato ab interno sit.    23.  Et dixerunt mihi, significat exhortationem: fac nobis 
deos qui eant ante nos, significat falsum doctrinae et cultus, ita idololatrica, n. 10,399: quia hic Moscheh ille vir, qui ascendere fecit nos e terra Aegypti, non scimus quid sit ei, significat 
quod prorsus ignotum quid Divinum Verum de Verbo aliud, quod ducit et elevat hominem. 24.  Et dixi illis, cui aurum avellite, significat extractionem ex sensu literae: et dederunt mihi, significat cupidinem 
et complacentiam: et projeci illud in ignem, significat ex amoribus illius gentis: et exivit vitulus, significat tale religiosum. 25.  Et vidit Moschen populum quod dissolutus ille, significat 
cognitionem quod gens illa prorsus in externo separato ab interno esset: quia dissolutum illum fecit Aharon, significat a capite ad calcem, ita totum: ad annihilationem insurgentibus illorum, significat 
sic absque omni potentia resistendi malis quae ab inferno.$ @2 quod IT$ </p>
