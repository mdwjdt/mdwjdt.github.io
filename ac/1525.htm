<h3 align="center" class="ired">属天的奥秘 第1525节</h3>
<h4 align="center"></h4><p><strong>1525.</strong>那些属脸部内在区域之人所在的光也向我显明。金色光芒因那些拥有对良善的情感之人而发生美丽变化，银色光芒则因那些拥有对真理的情感之人而发生美丽变化。有时他们也看到天空，但它不是我们的眼睛所看到的天空，而是呈现在他们面前的天空的一个代表物，上面还镶嵌着异常美丽的小星星。光之所以有这样的差别，是因为所有善灵都生活在第一层天堂，所有天使灵都生活在第二层天堂，所有天使则生活在第三层天堂，他们全都被普遍划分为属天的和属灵的。属天的是那些热爱良善的人，属灵的则是那些热爱真理的人。</p><br />

<p><strong>[NCE]1525.</strong> I was shown the glow that those who belong to a certain inner region of the face live in. It was a glow beautifully dappled with rays of golden flame for the benefit of those who respond to what is good, and with rays of silvery light for those who respond to what is true. Sometimes they are also able to see the sky, but not the sky that appears to our eyes. To their eyes the sky is represented as being resplendent with tiny stars.<br />The reason there is such a difference in the level of light is that all good spirits in the first heaven, all angelic spirits in the second heaven, and all angels in the third 钬?as a whole 钬?are divided into heavenly ones and spiritual ones. The heavenly ones are those who love what is good; the spiritual ones are those who love what is true. </p>

The kind of light in which those live who belong to a certain internal province of the face, was shown me. It was beautifully varied by rays of golden flame for those who are in affections of good, and 
by rays of silver light for those who are in affections of truth. Sometimes they see the sky-not that which appears before our eyes, but one that is represented before them--beautifully studded with 
little stars. The reason for the difference in the light is that all good spirits who are in the first heaven, and all angelic spirits who are in the second, and all angels who are in the third, are 
distinguished in general into the celestial and the spiritual; the celestial being those who are in the love of good, and the spiritual those who are in the love of truth. </p>

I was shown the light in which those live who belong to one of the internal provinces of the face. It was a brightness shot through with beautiful rays of golden flame for those whose affections are 
for good, and with rays of silvery light for those whose affections are for truth. Sometimes too they see a sky, though not the sky visible to our eyes. Before their eyes appears a representation of the 
sky, studded very beautifully with little stars. The reason for this difference in the light is that all good spirits who live in the first heaven, all angelic spirits who live in the second, and all 
angels who live in the third, are divided in general into celestial and spiritual. The celestial are those whose love is for good, the spiritual those whose love is for truth. </p>

</p><b>1525.</b>
Ostensum mihi lucidum, in quo vivunt qui ad internam quandam faciei provinciam pertinent; erat lucidum variatum pulchre radiis flammae aureae pro illis qui in affectionibus boni sunt, et lucidum variatum 
radiis lucis argenteae pro illis qui in affectionibus veri; quandoque etiam vident caelum, sed non hoc quod coram nostris oculis apparet, sed coram illis repraesentatum stellulis pulcherrime ornatum: 
quod differentia lucis sit, causa est quia omnes spiritus boni qui sunt primo caelo, et omnes spiritus angelici qui sunt in altero caelo, et omnes angeli qui in tertio, in genere distinguantur 
in caelestes et spirituales; caelestes sunt qui in amore boni, spirituales qui in amore veri. </p>
