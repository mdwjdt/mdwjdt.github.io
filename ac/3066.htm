<h3 align="center" class="ired">属天的奥秘 第3066节</h3>
<h4 align="center"></h4><p><strong>3066.</strong>“城内人的女子们正出来打水”表对真理的情感和通过这些情感所获得的教导。这从“女子”、“城内人”和“打水”的含义清楚可知。“女子”是指情感（参看<a href="489.htm">489</a>-<a href="491.htm">491</a>，<a href="2362.htm">2362</a>节）。“城内人”（men of the city）是指真理，因为在圣言中，城里的居民有时被称为“城内人”，有时被称为“城内居民”。他们若被称为“城内人”，就表示真理；若被称为“城内居民”，就表示良善。至于“人”（men）表示什么，可参看265，749，915，1007，2517节；“居民”表示什么，可参看2268，2451，2712；“城”表示什么，可参看402，2450，2943节。上面这些词的含义从“打水”的含义也明显可知，“打水”是指接受教导（参看<a href="3058.htm">3058</a>节）。由此明显可知，“城内人的女子们正出来打水”表对真理的情感和通过这些情感所获得的教导。<br />人是通过对真理的情感而非真理接受教导的。真理若缺乏情感，的确会像声音那样进入耳内，但不会进入记忆。使它们进入并留在记忆中的，是情感。情感的良善就像土壤，真理像种子一样就被播入其中。不过，土壤的品质，也就是情感的本质，决定了播种在那里的种子所产出之物的性质。目的或功用决定了土壤的品质，或情感的品质，因而也决定了播种在那里的种子所产出之物的品质。或若你愿意，也可以说爱本身决定它。因为在一切事物中，爱就是目的和功用。若非所爱之物，没有什么东西会被视为目的和功用。</p>

And the daughters of the men of the city come out to draw waters. That this signifies the affections of truth and instruction through them, is evident from the signification of "daughters," as being 
affections (see n. 489-491, 2362); and from the signification of "the men of the city," as being truths. (The inhabitants of a city are frequently called in the Word the "men of the city," and frequently 
the "inhabitants of the city;" when they are called the "men of the city," truths are signified, and when they are called the "inhabitants," goods are signified; what "men" signify, may be seen above, 
n. 265, 749, 915, 1007, 2517; and what "inhabitants," n. 2268, 2451, 2712; what a "city," n. 402, 2450, 2943.) The signification of the above words is evident also from the signification of "drawing 
water," as being to be instructed (see above, n. 3058). Hence it is evident that by the "daughters of the men of the city coming out to draw waters," are signified the affections of truth, and instruction 
through them. No one is ever instructed by means of truths, but by means of the affections of truth; for truths apart from affection do indeed come to the ear as sound, but do not enter into 
the memory; that which causes them to enter into the memory and to abide in it, is affection. For the good of affection is like soil, in which truths are sown as seeds; but such as the soil is (that is, 
such as the affection is), such is the produce of that which is sown. The end or use determines the quality of the soil, or of the affection, and thus the quality of the produce of what is sown; or, 
if you prefer to say so, the love itself determines it; for in all things the love is the end and the use, for nothing is regarded as the end and use except that which is loved. </p>

<p align="center"><b>Elliott(1983-1999) 3066</b></p><p><b>3066.</b>
'And the daughters of the men of the city are coming out to draw water' means affections for truth, and instruction acquired through those affections. This is clear from the meaning of 'daughters' as 
affections, dealt with in <a href="489.htm">489</a>-<a href="491.htm">491</a>, <a href="2362.htm">2362</a>; from the meaning of 'the men of the city' as truths, for in the Word the residents of a city are sometimes called 'the men of the city', sometimes 'the inhabitants 
of the city', truths being meant when they are called 'the men of the city', goods when they are called 'the inhabitants' - what 'men' means, see <a href="265.htm">265</a>, <a href="749.htm">749</a>, <a href="915.htm">915</a>, <a href="1007.htm">1007</a>, <a href="2517.htm">2517</a>, what 'inhabitants' means, <a href="2268.htm">2268</a>, <a href="2451.htm">2451</a>, <a href="2712.htm">2712</a>, and what 'a city' means, <a href="402.htm">402</a>, <a href="2449.htm">2449</a>, <a href="2943.htm">2943</a>; and from the meaning of 'drawing water' as receiving instruction, dealt with above in <a href="3058.htm">3058</a>. From all this it is evident that 'the daughters 
of the men of the city are coming out to draw water' means affections for truth, and instruction acquired through those affections. </p>

<p><b>[2]</b>
 No one is ever instructed through truths but through the 
affections for truth. For when truths are devoid of affection they do indeed flow as sounds into the ear but they do not pass into the memory. What causes them to pass into the memory and stay there 
is affection. For good that is the object of affection is like the soil into which truths are sown as seeds. But the quality of the soil, that is, the essential nature of the affection, determines the 
nature of that which is produced from the seed sown there. The end in view or the use dictates the essential nature of the ground - that is, of the affection - and so dictates the nature of that which 
is produced from the seed sown there. Or if you prefer, the love itself is what decides it, for love is to all things the end in view and the use. Nothing is considered to be an end in view and a use 
except that which is loved. </p>

`Et filiae virorum urbis exeuntes ad hauriendum aquas': quod significet affectiones veri, et per illas instructionem, constat a significatione `filiarum' quod sint affectiones, de qua n. 489-491, 2362; 
ex significatione `virorum urbis' quod sint vera; {1}incolae urbis in Verbo passim dicuntur `viri urbis,' passim `habitatores urbis'; cum `viri urbis,' significantur vera, cum `habitatores,' significantur 
bona; quid `viri,' videatur n. 265, 749, 915, 1007, 2517; quid `habitatores,' n. 2268, 2451, 2712; quid `urbs,' n. 402, (x)2449, 2943; et a significatione `haurire aquas' quod sit instrui, de 
qua supra n. 3058; inde patet quod per `filias virorum urbis exeuntes ad hauriendum aquas'    significentur affectiones veri, et per illas instructio; [2] per vera nusquam aliquis instruitur, sed per 
affectiones veri; vera enim absque affectione alluunt quidem ad aurem sicut sonus, sed non intrant in memoriam; quod facit ut {2}intrent in memoriam, et ei inhaereant, est affectio; est enim {3}bonum 
affectionis sicut humus, cui vera sicut semina inseminantur, sed qualis humus, hoc est, qualis affectio, talis est inseminati productio; finis aut usus dictat qualis humus, seu qualis affectio, ita qualis 
inseminati productio; aut si mavis, ipse amor dictat, nam amor est omnibus finis et usus; nihil enim pro fine habetur, et pro usu, nisi quod amatur. @1 in Verbo enim incolae urbis$  @2 memoriae
