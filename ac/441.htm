<h3 align="center" class="ired">属天的奥秘 第441节</h3>
<h4 align="center"></h4><p><strong>441.</strong>从前文有关上古教会（它在事奉与敬拜主方面远胜其它教会）的说明，以及亚伯将羊群中头生的献为供物的事实清楚可知，那时还没有开始求告耶和华的名；因此在这段经文中，“求告耶和华的名”无非表新教会的敬拜，而先前的教会已被那些所谓“该隐”和“拉麦”者灭亡了。</p>

<p><strong>[NCE]441.</strong> This was not actually when people first started calling on Jehovah's name, as is fairly clear from the information above concerning the earliest church, which more than other churches revered and worshiped the Lord.{*1} The fact that Abel brought an offering from the firstborn of his flock is further evidence. So calling on the name of Jehovah here means nothing else than the worship of the new church after the previous one had been destroyed by those called Cain and, later, Lamech.<br /><br /><strong>Footnotes:</strong><br />{*1} For passages above in the main text that mention the closeness between the Lord and the earliest church, see <a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_441/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_49" target=_top>49:1</a>, <a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_441/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_125" target=_top>125</a>, <a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_441/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_337" target=_top>337:1</a>, <a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_441/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_393" target=_top>393</a>, <a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_441/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_414#subsection-2-3" target=_top>414:3</a>, <a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_441/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_4" target=_top>4</a>.

<p align="center"><b>Potts(1905-1910) 441</b></p><p><b>441.</b>
That the invocation of the name of Jehovah did not commence at this time, is sufficiently evident from what has already been said above in regard to the Most Ancient Church, which more than any other 
adored and worshiped the Lord; and also from the fact that Abel brought an offering of the firstlings of the flock; so that in this passage by "calling upon the name of Jehovah" nothing else is signified 
than the worship of the new church, after the former church had been extinguished by those who are called "Cain" and "Lamech." </p>

<p align="center"><b>Elliott(1983-1999) 441</b></p><p><b>441.</b>
The fact that this was not the point at which people first started to call on the name of Jehovah is quite clear from what appears in preceding sections about the Most Ancient Church, which excelled 
all other Churches in its adoration and worship of the Lord, and also from Abel' s bringing a gift from the firstborn of the flock. At the present point therefore nothing else is meant by 'calling on 
the name of Jehovah' than the worship of a new Church, after the previous Church had been annihilated by those who are called Cain and later on Lamech.  </p>

<p align="center"><b>Latin(1748-1756) 441</b>
</p><b>441.</b>
Quod invocatio nominis Jehovae non nunc primum coepta sit, constare satis potest a praecedentibus de Antiquissima Ecclesia, quae prae aliis adoravit et coluit Dominum; tum quoque quod Habel attulerit 
munus ex primogenitis gregis; quare hic per 'invocare nomen Jehovae' nihil aliud significatur quam cultus novae Ecclesiae, postquam exstincta fuit per eos qui 'Cain' et demum 'Lamech' vocantur. </p>
