<h3 align="center" class="ired">属天的奥秘 第10042节</h3>
<h4 align="center"></h4><p><strong>10042</strong>.“你要牵一只公绵羊来“表内在人中的纯真之良善。这从“公绵羊”的含义清楚可知，“公绵羊”是指内在人中纯真和仁爱的良善，如下文所述。由于本章论述的是公绵羊和羔羊的祭牲和燔祭，故必须阐明献作祭牲和燔祭的动物或活物一般表示什么。这些动物或活物是公牛、小公牛、公山羊、公绵羊、母山羊、小公山羊、母羔羊和小母山羊。人若不知道这些动物或活物表示什么，就不可能知道由它们构成的祭牲和燔祭具体表示什么。要知道，地上的一切动物或活物都表示诸如存在于人里面的那类事物，这些事物一般都与他意愿的情感和理解力的思维有关，因而与良善和真理有关，或说在于存在于他意愿中的情感和存在于他理解力中的思维，因而在于良善和真理；因为良善属于意愿，真理属于理解力。这些事物因与良善和真理有关，或说在于良善和真理，故也与爱和信有关，或说在于爱和信，因为爱的一切被称为良善，信的一切被称为真理。<br />这些不同种类的动物或活物表示这类事物的原因在于来世的代表，因为属于许多属和无数种类的动物或活物会出现在来世。在那里，这类动物或活物具有栩栩如生的外表，对应于灵人和天使的情感和思维。事实的确如此，这一点从先知在圣言各个地方所提到的异象也明显看出来；因为先知所看到的一切都是诸如在天堂出现在天使眼前的那类事物。这解释了为何在圣言中，经上如此频繁地提及到牲畜或动物，它们各自都表示与人里面的那类事物有关的某种东西，如前所述。就其外在人或外在自我而言，人无非是动物；但就其内在人或内在自我而言，他不同于动物。他的内在人和外在人，或说内在自我和外在自我都能通过他的内在人或内在自我而被提升到天堂和神那里，由此接受信和爱。这就是为何动物或牲畜被用于祭牲和燔祭。人若对这一切一无所知，就不可能知道为何经上吩咐在这一场合下献上小公牛、公绵羊，或公羔羊；在那一场合下献上公牛、母山羊、母羔羊；而在另一个场合下献上公山羊、小公山羊、小母山羊。这些不同还能有什么其它原因呢？ 在圣言中，“牲畜或动物”表示与人同在的良善或邪恶，以及真理或虚假（参看<a href="142.htm">142</a>，<a href="143.htm">143</a>，<a href="246.htm">246</a>，<a href="714.htm">714</a>，<a href="715.htm">715</a>，<a href="776.htm">776</a>，<a href="1823.htm">1823</a>，<a href="2179.htm">2179</a>，<a href="2180.htm">2180</a>，<a href="2781.htm">2781</a>，<a href="3218.htm">3218</a>，<a href="3519.htm">3519</a>，<a href="5198.htm">5198</a>，<a href="7523.htm">7523</a>，<a href="7872.htm">7872</a>，<a href="9090.htm">9090</a>节）；正是由于这种含义，它们才被用来献祭（<a href="1823.htm">1823</a>，<a href="2180.htm">2180</a>，<a href="2805.htm">2805</a>，<a href="2807.htm">2807</a>，<a href="2830.htm">2830</a>节）。<br />然而，就这些动物或活物构成的祭牲和燔祭而言，要知道：（1）犹太和以色列民族当中的代表性敬拜主要在于祭牲和燔祭；（2）祭牲和燔祭一般表示一个人通过从主所接受的信之真理和爱之良善的重生，在至高意义上表示主之人身的荣耀；（3）敬拜的一切事物，即构成它的各种不同事物，因而各种各样的敬拜由祭牲和燔祭来代表，这就是为何经上规定要用各种不同的动物或活物。<br />不过，要详细论述这些要点：（1）犹太和以色列民族当中的代表性敬拜主要在于祭牲和燔祭。这一点从以下事实清楚看出来：用它们是为了一切罪和一切罪愆，也为一切祝圣和供职；此外，每天、每个安息日、新个月朔和每个节期都会用到它们；因此，祭坛是最神圣的事物。这个民族当中的敬拜的其它一切行为都取决于献祭的场合，这解释了为何在但以理书论述废除代表性敬拜的地方，经上说“祭祀与供献必止息”（但以理书<a href="http://39-27.cn/但9.27.htm">9:27</a>），“要除掉常献的祭”（但以理书<a href="http://39-27.cn/但8.10.htm">8:10</a>-<a href="http://39-27.cn/但8.13.htm">13</a>；<a href="http://39-27.cn/但11.31.htm">11:31</a>；<a href="http://39-27.cn/但12.11.htm">12:11</a>）。“常献的祭”具体表示每天献上的祭，总体上表示一切敬拜。不过，可参看前面关于这些事物的说明，即：祭祀总体上表示一切代表性的敬拜（<a href="923.htm">923</a>，<a href="2165.htm">2165</a>，<a href="6905.htm">6905</a>，<a href="8680.htm">8680</a>，<a href="8936.htm">8936</a>节）；祭坛是主和由此而来的敬拜的主要代表（<a href="2771.htm">2771</a>，<a href="2811.htm">2811</a>，<a href="8935.htm">8935</a>，<a href="8940.htm">8940</a>，<a href="9388.htm">9388</a>，<a href="9389.htm">9389</a>，<a href="9714.htm">9714</a>，<a href="9964.htm">9964</a>节）；希伯之前的古人对祭祀一无所知（<a href="2180.htm">2180</a>节）；祭祀是在希伯的时代设立的，并从那时起就存在于希伯来民族当中，因而存在于雅各的后代当中，以及他们为什么这样做（<a href="1128.htm">1128</a>，<a href="1343.htm">1343</a>，<a href="2180.htm">2180</a>，<a href="2818.htm">2818</a>节）；祭祀不是吩咐的，仅仅是允许（<a href="2180.htm">2180</a>节）。<br />（2）祭牲和燔祭一般表示一个人通过从主所接受的对主之信的真理和对主之爱的良善的重生。这一点从以下事实清楚看出来：敬拜的一切都与从邪恶和虚假中的洁净、真理和良善的植入，以及它们的结合有关，因而与重生有关，因为人通过这三者重生。这解释了为何祭牲和燔祭是为一切罪和一切罪愆而献上的；经上说，当献上它们时，就赎罪了，必蒙赦免（利未记<a href="http://39-27.cn/利4.20.htm">4:20</a>，<a href="http://39-27.cn/利4.26.htm">26</a>，<a href="http://39-27.cn/利4.31.htm">31</a>，<a href="http://39-27.cn/利4.35.htm">35</a>；<a href="http://39-27.cn/利5.6.htm">5:6</a>，<a href="http://39-27.cn/利5.10.htm">10</a>，<a href="http://39-27.cn/利5.13.htm">13</a>，<a href="http://39-27.cn/利5.16.htm">16</a>，<a href="http://39-27.cn/利5.18.htm">18</a>；<a href="http://39-27.cn/利6.7.htm">6:7</a>；<a href="http://39-27.cn/利7.7.htm">7:7</a>；<a href="http://39-27.cn/利10.17.htm">10:17</a>；<a href="http://39-27.cn/利14.18.htm">14:18</a>，<a href="http://39-27.cn/利14.19.htm">19</a>；<a href="http://39-27.cn/利15.30.htm">15:30</a>，<a href="http://39-27.cn/利15.31.htm">31</a>；<a href="http://39-27.cn/利16.6.htm">16:6</a>，<a href="http://39-27.cn/利16.24.htm">24</a>；<a href="http://39-27.cn/利17.11.htm">17:11</a>）。罪的赦免、赎罪、遮罪和救赎无非是从邪恶和虚假中的洁净，良善和真理的植入，以及它们的结合，也就是重生（<a href="9076.htm">9076</a>，<a href="9452.htm">9452</a>-<a href="9454.htm">9454</a>，<a href="9937.htm">9937</a>，<a href="9938.htm">9938</a>节）。每种祭牲和燔祭的特定仪式也描述了重生的整个过程，当内义将它的代表性元素逐渐展开时，对这个过程的一个清晰认识就会浮现（<a href="10022.htm">10022</a>节）。<br />就至高意义而言，祭牲和燔祭表示主之人身的荣耀。这是因为在以色列和犹太民族当中所设立的一切敬拜仪式都唯独关注主；因此，祭牲和燔祭尤其关注祂，因为它们一般代表敬拜的一切，如前所示。此外，人重生的唯一源头就是主（<a href="9506.htm">9506</a>，<a href="9715.htm">9715</a>，<a href="9486.htm">9486</a>，<a href="9487.htm">9487</a>，<a href="9809.htm">9809</a>，<a href="10019.htm">10019</a>节）。因此，当圣言论述人的重生时，在至高意义上论述的主题就是主之人身的荣耀；因为一个人的重生就是主荣耀的一个形像（<a href="3138.htm">3138</a>，<a href="3212.htm">3212</a>，<a href="3296.htm">3296</a>，<a href="3490.htm">3490</a>，<a href="4402.htm">4402</a>，<a href="5688.htm">5688</a>节）。荣耀祂的人身意味着将它变成神性，而使一个人重生则意味着使他成为天堂，好叫主的神性能住在他里面。<br />（3）敬拜的一切事物，即构成它的各种不同事物，因而各种各样的敬拜由祭牲和燔祭来代表，这就是为何经上规定要用各种不同的动物或活物。这一点从规定祭牲和燔祭所为的各种情况清楚看出来，即为：因错事而犯的罪，不是因错事所犯的罪；一切过犯和不洁，无论祭司那一方的，还是全会众，首领，抑或任何平凡人；洁净大麻疯；分娩后的洁净；为给祭坛、会幕和其中的一切祝圣；亚伦一年一次进至圣所时而洁净这些事物；亚伦和他儿子承接祭司职分；给拿细耳人祝圣；以及一般的三个节期，每个月朔，安息日，每天早晚；此外还有还愿祭和甘心祭。<br />由于祭牲和燔祭是为如此多不同的情况而规定的，它们代表构成敬拜的各种不同事物，所以经上还规定要用各种不同的动物或活物，即：小公牛、公牛、公山羊；公绵羊、母山羊、小公山羊；公羔羊，母羔羊，小母山羊。小公牛、公牛和公山羊所构成的祭牲和燔祭代表外在人或属世人的洁净和重生；公绵羊、母山羊和小公山羊所构成的祭牲和燔祭代表内在人或属灵人的洁净和重生；公羔羊、母羔羊和小母山羊所构成的祭牲和燔祭代表至内在的人，或属天人的洁净和重生。人里面有三个层级按次序彼此跟随，即属天层、属灵层和属世层（参看<a href="9992.htm">9992</a>，<a href="10005.htm">10005</a>，<a href="10117.htm">10117</a>节）；如果一个人要重生，内在事物和外在事物都必须重生（参看<a href="925.htm">925</a>e节所提到的地方）。<br />但至于本章所论述的由一只公绵羊所构成的祭牲和燔祭具体表示什么，这从圣言中描述公绵羊的祭牲和燔祭，或提到公绵羊的地方明显看出来。从这些地方明显看出，“公绵羊”表示内在人中纯真和仁爱的良善；它所构成的祭牲和燔祭表示内在人的洁净和重生，因而表示内在人中纯真和仁爱的良善的植入。“公绵羊”的这种含义从下列经文明显看出来。以赛亚书：<br />基达所有的羊群都必聚集到你这里，尼拜约的公绵羊要供你使用；它们必蒙悦纳上我的祭坛。（以赛亚书<a href="http://39-27.cn/赛60.7.htm">60:7</a>）<br />这论及主，以及祂的天堂和教会；“基达的羊群”是指内在人的一切良善；“尼拜约的公绵羊”是指内在人中纯真和仁爱的良善；“羊群”是指内在人的良善（参看<a href="8937.htm">8937</a>，<a href="9135.htm">9135</a>节）；“基达”是指良善所在的地方（<a href="3268.htm">3268</a>节）；“尼拜约”是指那里那些处于该良善的人（<a href="3268.htm">3268</a>，<a href="3686.htm">3686</a>，<a href="3688.htm">3688</a>节）。<br />以西结书：<br />亚拉伯人和基达的一切首领都作你手下的客商，用小牲畜、公绵羊、公山羊与你交易。（以西结书<a href="http://39-27.cn/结27.21.htm">27:21</a>）<br />这论及推罗，推罗表示有关于良善和真理的认知或知识存在的教会（<a href="1201.htm">1201</a>节）；“商人”是指那些拥有这些认知或知识，并把它们传下去的人（<a href="2967.htm">2967</a>，<a href="4453.htm">4453</a>节）；“小牲畜”是指爱之良善；“公绵羊”是指仁之良善；“公山羊”是指信之良善。在圣言中，经上提到“羊群”、“小牲畜”和“羊群成员”，它们在原文按名称而区分开来。“羊群”表示总体上的内在事物，“羊群成员”表示具体的内在事物；“小牲畜”表示具体的至内在事物。但“牛群”表示外在事物。耶利米书：<br />我必使他们像小牲畜，像公绵羊和公山羊，下到宰杀之地。（耶利米书<a href="http://39-27.cn/耶51.40.htm">51:40</a>）<br />“小牲畜”、“公绵羊”和“公山羊”的意思大致相同。<br />以西结书：<br />主耶和华如此说，看哪，我必在羊群与羊群成员中间，公羊与公山羊中间施行判断。（以西结书<a href="http://39-27.cn/结34.17.htm">34:17</a>）<br />“羊群与羊群成员中间”表示在那些处于良善和邪恶的内层事物的人之间；“公绵羊与公山羊中间”表示在那些处于仁并由此处于信的人与那些处于无仁的信之真理的人之间；“公羊”在此和绵羊所表相同，因为公羊是指公绵羊。“绵羊”表示那些处于仁并由此处于信的人（参看<a href="4169.htm">4169</a>，<a href="4809.htm">4809</a>节）；“公山羊”表示那些处于被称为信之真理的真理，但没有仁爱的人（<a href="4169.htm">4169</a>e，<a href="4769.htm">4769</a>节）。但以理书8章中的“公绵羊”和“公山羊”具有同样的含义，马太福音（<a href="http://39-27.cn/太25.32.htm">25:32-46</a>）中的“绵羊”和“山羊”也具有同样的含义。<br />摩西五经：<br />一个灵魂若因错事犯了罪，就要从羊群中牵一只没有残疾的公绵羊来给耶和华赎愆祭。（利未记<a href="http://39-27.cn/利5.15.htm">5:15</a>，<a href="http://39-27.cn/利5.18.htm">18</a>；<a href="http://39-27.cn/利6.6.htm">6:6</a>）<br />公绵羊的祭牲表示内在人的洁净，内在人中纯真之良善的植入；因为“因错事所犯的罪”是指由于含有纯真在里面的无知而犯的罪，无知的纯真属于内在人。<br />民数记：<br />每月朔（即每月初一），你们要献上两只小公牛，一只公绵羊，七只公羊羔，献给耶和华为燔祭；然后献上一只公山羊。逾越节期间的每一天，以及初熟之物的这一天，都要做这种事。（民数记<a href="http://39-27.cn/民28.11.htm">28:11</a>，<a href="http://39-27.cn/民28.15.htm">15</a>，<a href="http://39-27.cn/民28.19.htm">19</a>，<a href="http://39-27.cn/民28.22.htm">22</a>，<a href="http://39-27.cn/民28.27.htm">27</a>，<a href="http://39-27.cn/民28.30.htm">30</a>）<br />做这一切是为了可以代表整个人的洁净，无论外在，内在还是至内在。小公牛的祭牲和燔祭代表外在人的洁净；公绵羊的祭牲和燔祭代表内在人的洁净；羔羊的祭牲和燔祭代表至内在之人的洁净。由于所代表的是洁净，故所代表的也是纯真之良善的植入；因为“小公牛”是指外在人中的纯真之良善，“公绵羊”是指内在人中的这良善，“公羔羊”是指至内在之人中的这良善，如前所述。它们当中最后的动物或活物之所以是公山羊，是因为“公山羊”表示外在人中的信之真理，那里的信之真理是最末和最低的（<a href="9959.htm">9959</a>节）。由于与人同在的良善和真理按这个次序彼此跟随，所以当膏抹祭坛和会幕时，以色列首领的供物是一只小公牛，一只公绵羊，一只公羔羊作燔祭；一只公山羊作祭牲（民数记<a href="http://39-27.cn/民7.15.htm">7:15</a>-<a href="http://39-27.cn/民7.17.htm">17</a>，<a href="http://39-27.cn/民7.21.htm">21</a>-<a href="http://39-27.cn/民7.23.htm">23</a>，<a href="http://39-27.cn/民7.27.htm">27</a>-<a href="http://39-27.cn/民7.29.htm">29</a>，<a href="http://39-27.cn/民7.33.htm">33</a>ff）。由此可见，“公绵羊”表示内在人中纯真和仁爱的良善。</p>

And thou shalt take one ram. That this signifies the good of innocence in the internal man, is evident from the signification of a "ram," as being the good of innocence and of charity in the internal 
man (of which in what follows). As in this chapter the sacrifices and burnt-offerings of rams and of lambs are treated of, it must be told what was signified by the animals in general that were offered 
in the sacrifices and burnt-offerings. These animals were oxen, bullocks, he-goats, rams, she-goats, and he-kids; also he-lambs, she-lambs, and she-kids. One who does not know what these animals signify, 
cannot possibly know what is specifically signified by the sacrifices and burnt-offerings of them. Be it known that all animals on the earth signify such things as are in man, which in general 
bear relation to the affections of his will and the thoughts of his understanding, thus to goods and truths, for goods are of the will, and truths are of the understanding. And as they bear relation to 
goods and truths, they also bear relation to love and faith, for all things of love are called goods, and all things of faith are called truths. [2] That animals of different kinds have such a signification 
has its cause in the representatives in the other life; for in that life there appear animals of many genera and innumerable species. Such animals there are appearances to the very life, corresponding 
to the affections and thoughts that exist with the spirits and angels. That this is so can be seen also from the prophetic visions in the Word throughout; for all things seen by the prophets 
are such as appear before the angels in heaven. From this it is that beasts are so frequently mentioned in the Word, and by everyone of them is signified something that bears relation to such things 
as are in man (of which above). Neither is man anything but an animal in respect to his external man, but he is distinguished from animals by the internal man, whereby both the internal and the external 
man can be elevated toward heaven and to God, and thence receive faith and love. From this it is that beasts were employed in the sacrifices and burnt-offerings. He who does not know this, cannot 
possibly know why it was commanded at one time to offer bullocks, rams, and he-lambs; at another time oxen, she-goats, and she-lambs; and at another he-goats, he-kids, and she-kids; for otherwise what 
would be the purpose of such things? (That in the Word "beasts" signify goods and evils with man, and also truths and falsities, see n. 142, 143, 246, 714, 715, 776, 1823, 2179, 2180, 2781, 3218, 3519, 
5198, 7523, 7872, 9090; and that on this account they were employed in the sacrifices, n. 1823, 2180, 2805, 2807, 2830.) [3] But as regards the sacrifices and burnt-offerings from them, be it known: 
(1) that the representative worship with the Jewish and Israelitish nation consisted chiefly in sacrifices and burnt-offerings; (2) that the sacrifices and burnt-offerings in general signified the 
regeneration of man through the truths of faith and the goods of love from the Lord; and in the supreme sense the glorification of the Lord's Human; (3) that everything of worship, according to the various 
things of it, was represented by the sacrifices and burnt-offerings, thus with all variety; and that for this reason various kinds of animals were commanded. [4] But to take up these points in 
detail: (1) That the representative worship with the Jewish and Israelitish nation consisted chiefly in sacrifices and burnt-offerings, is evident from the fact that they were employed for every sin, 
and for every guilt; also for every consecration and inauguration; and besides on every day, on every Sabbath, every new moon, and every festival; and that for this reason the altar was the most holy 
of all things, and all the other things of worship with that nation depended upon these. Therefore where the abolition of representative worship is treated of in Daniel, it is said that "the sacrifice 
and oblation shall cease" (Dan. 9:27), and "the continual sacrifice shall be removed" (Dan. 8:10-13; 11:31; 12:11). By "the continual sacrifice" is specifically signified the sacrifice that was offered 
daily, and in general all worship. But see what has already been shown about these things, namely, that sacrifices in general signify all representative worship (n. 923, 2165, 6905, 8680, 8936); that 
the altar was the principal representative of the Lord and from this of worship (n. 2771, 2811, 8935, 8940, 9388, 9389, 9714, 9964); that the ancients before Eber knew nothing of sacrifices (n. 2180); 
that by Eber, thus with the Hebrew nation, and from this with the posterity of Jacob, sacrifices were instituted, and why (n. 1128, 1343, 2180, 2818); that sacrifices were not commanded, but permitted 
(n. 2180). [5] (2) That sacrifices and burnt-offerings in general signified the regeneration of man through the truths of faith and the goods of love to the Lord from the Lord, is evident from the 
fact that all things of worship relate to purification from evils and falsities, to the implanting of truth and good, and to their conjunction, thus to regeneration; for by means of these three things 
man is regenerated; consequently sacrifices and burnt-offerings were offered for every sin and for every guilt; and when they were offered, it is said that expiation was made and that pardon would 
be granted (Lev. 4:20, 26, 31, 35; 5:6, 10, 13, 16, 18; 6:7; 7:7; 10:17; 14:18, 19; 15:30, 31; 16:6, 24; 17:11). The pardon of sins, expiation, propitiation, and redemption, are also nothing else than 
purification from evils and falsities, the implantation of good and truth, and their conjunction, thus regeneration (n. 9076, 9452-9454, 9937, 9938). Every process of regeneration is also described 
by the special rituals of the several sacrifices and burnt-offerings, and it is opened when the representatives are unfolded by means of the internal sense (n. 10022).  [6] That in the supreme sense 
the sacrifices and burnt-offerings signify the glorification of the Lord's Human, is because all the rituals of worship instituted with the Israelitish and Jewish nation regarded the Lord alone; thus 
the sacrifices and burnt-offerings especially regarded Him, because by them in general was represented everything of worship, as has been shown above. Moreover, the regeneration of man is from no other 
source than the Lord (n. 9506, 9715, 9486, 9487, 9809, 10019); and therefore where the regeneration of man is treated of in the Word, in the supreme sense the glorification of the Lord's Human is treated 
of; for the regeneration of man is an image of the glorification of the Lord (n. 3138, 3212, 3296, 3490, 4402, 5688). To glorify the Human is to make it Divine, but to regenerate man is to make 
him heavenly, in order that the Divine of the Lord may dwell in him. [7] (3) That everything of worship, according to the various things of it, was represented by the sacrifices and burnt-offerings, 
thus with all variety, and that for this reason various kinds of animals were commanded, is evident from the various things for which sacrifices and burnt-offerings were made; namely, for sins by error, 
and for sins not by error; for every transgression and uncleanness, whether with the priest, or with the whole assembly, or with a prince, or with any soul; for cleansing from leprosy; for purification 
after child-bearing; for the consecration of the altar, of the Tent of meeting and of all things therein; for the cleansing of the same when Aaron once every year entered into the holy of holies; 
for the inauguration of Aaron and his sons into the priesthood; for the consecration of the Nazirites; and in general on the three feasts, on each of the new moons, on the Sabbaths, and daily in the 
morning and between the evenings; besides the votive and voluntary offerings.  [8] As there were sacrifices and burnt-offerings for such various purposes, and by them were represented the various things 
of worship, therefore also the various kinds of animals that were to be offered were commanded; namely, bullocks, oxen, and he-goats; rams, she-goats, and he-kids; he-lambs, she-lambs, and she-kids; 
and by the sacrifices and burnt-offerings from the bullock, ox, and he-goat were represented the purification and regeneration of the external or natural man; by those from the ram, she-goat, and he-kid 
were represented the purification of the internal or spiritual man; and by those from the he-lamb, she-lamb, and she-kid were represented the purification or regeneration of the inmost or celestial 
man. (That there are three things that are in succession with man: the celestial, the spiritual, and the natural, see n. 9992, 10005, 10117; and that in order to be regenerated a man must be regenerated 
as to things internal and also external, see the places cited in n. 9325 at the end.) [9] But what is specifically signified by the sacrifice and the burnt-offering from a ram, which are treated 
of in this chapter, is evident from the passages in the Word where sacrifices and burnt-offerings from a ram are described, and where a ram is mentioned; from which it is plain that by a "ram" is signified 
the good of innocence and of charity in the internal man; and by the sacrifice and burnt-offering from it, the purification and regeneration of the internal man; thus the implantation of the 
good of innocence and charity therein. That this is signified by a "ram," is evident from the following passages. In Isaiah: </p>
<p>     All the flocks of Arabia shall be gathered together to thee, the rams 
of Nebaioth shall minister to thee; they shall come up with acceptance on Mine altar (Isa. 60:7); </p>
<p>where the subject treated of is the Lord and His heaven and church; "the flocks of Arabia" denote all 
the goods of the internal man; "the rams of Nebaioth" denote the goods of innocence and of charity there. (That "flocks" denote the good of the internal man, see n. 8937, 9135; that "Arabia" denotes 
where good is, n. 3268; that "Nebaioth" denotes those who are there in this good, n. 3268, 3686, 3688.) [10] In Ezekiel: </p>
<p>     Arabia and all the princes of Kedar, the traders of thy hand in small cattle, 
and rams, and he-goats (Ezek. 27:21); </p>
<p>speaking of Tyre, by which is signified the church where are the knowledges of good and truth (n. 1201); "traders" denote those who have these knowledges 
and communicate them (n. 2967, 4453); "small cattle" denote the goods of love; "rams," the goods of charity; and "he-goats," the goods of faith. In the Word mention is made of "flocks," "small cattle" 
[pecora], and "cattle" [pecudes], which in the original tongue are distinguished by their names, and by "flocks" are signified in general internal things; by "cattle," the same specifically, and by "small 
cattle," inmost things specifically; but by "herds" are signified external things. In Jeremiah: </p>
<p>     I will bring them down like small cattle to the slaughter, like rams with he-goats (Jer. 51:40); </p>
<p>by 
"small cattle," "rams," and "he-goats" similar things are here signified. [11] In Ezekiel: </p>
<p>     Thus said the Lord Jehovih, Behold I judge between cattle and cattle, and between the rams and 
the he-goats (Ezek. 34:17); </p>
<p>     "between cattle and cattle" denotes between those who are in the interior things of good and of evil; "between the rams and the he-goats" denotes between those who 
are in charity and thence in faith, and those who are in the truths of faith without charity; "rams" here signify the like as sheep, for rams are the males of sheep (that "sheep" denote those who are 
in charity and from this in faith, see n. 4169, 4809; and that "he-goats" denote those who are in truths, which are called the truths of faith, without charity, n. 4169, 4769). Like things are signified 
by the "ram" and the "he-goat" in Daniel 8; and by the "sheep" and the "he-goats" in Matthew 25:32. [12] In Moses: </p>
<p>     If a soul hath sinned through error, he shall bring his guilt to Jehovah, a 
ram without blemish out of the flock (Lev. 5:15, 18; 6:6); </p>
<p>by the sacrifices from a ram is signified the purification of the internal man and the implantation of the good of innocence therein; for "sin 
through error" denotes sin from ignorance in which is innocence, and the innocence of ignorance is of the internal man. [13] In the same: </p>
<p>     In the new moons they were to offer two bullocks, one 
ram, and seven he-lambs; and afterward a he-goat; in like manner on every day of the passover; and on the day of the firstfruits (Num. 28:11, 15, 19, 22, 27); </p>
<p>this was in order that there might be 
represented the purification of the whole man, as well external as internal and inmost; by the sacrifice and burnt-offering from bullocks, the purification of the external man; from a ram, the purification 
of the internal man; and from the lambs, the purification of the inmost man. And as purification was represented, so also was the implanting of the good of innocence, for a "bullock" denotes the 
good of innocence in the external man; a "ram," in the internal, and a "he-lamb" in the inmost, as said above; that the last of them was a he-goat was because by a "he-goat" is signified the truth of 
faith in the external man, and the truth of faith there is the ultimate (n. 9959). As the goods and truths with man follow in this order, therefore also the presents of the princes of Israel, when the 
altar and the Tent of meeting were anointed, were a bullock, a ram, and a he-lamb for burnt-offerings; and a he-goat for a sacrifice (Num. 7:15-17, 21-23, 27-29, 33, and following verses). From all 
this it can now be seen that a "ram" signifies the good of innocence and of charity in the internal man. </p>

<p align="center"><b>Elliott(1983-1999) 10042</b></p><p><b>10042.</b>
'And you shall take one ram' means the good of innocence in the internal man. This is clear from the meaning of 'a ram' as the good of innocence and charity in the internal man, dealt with below. Since 
sacrifices and burnt offerings of rams and lambs are referred to in this chapter, the general meaning of the living creatures offered in sacrifices and burnt offerings must be stated. Those creatures 
were oxen, young bulls, and he-goats; rams, she-goats, and he-kids; and he-lambs, she-lambs, and she-kids of she-goats. Anyone who does not know what these creatures serve to mean cannot possibly know 
what is meant by a sacrifice or burnt offering of any of them in particular. It should be recognized that all living creatures on earth serve to mean things such as reside in the human being, which 
in general consist in affections present in his will and in thoughts present in his understanding, and so consist in forms of good and in truths; for forms of good belong to the will and truths to the 
understanding. And since those things consist in forms of good and in truths they also consist in love and faith; for all aspects of love are called forms of good, and all matters of faith are called 
truths.  </p>
<p></p>
<p><b>[2]</b>
 The reason why these different kinds of living creatures serve to mean such things lies in representatives in the next life, where creatures belonging to many genera and countless species 
appear. Such creatures there are wholly lifelike appearances corresponding to spirits' and angels' affections and thoughts. The truth of this is evident also from the visions of the prophets spoken 
of in places throughout the Word; for all the things that were seen by the prophets are such as appear in heaven before angels' eyes. This explains why mention in the Word is so often made of beasts 
or animals, each of which serves to mean something belonging to one of the categories of things residing in the human being. As to his outward self the human being is no more than an animal; but his 
inward self makes him different. By means of his inward self both this inward self and his outward self can be raised towards heaven and up to God, and can as a consequence receive faith and love. 
This is why animals were used in sacrifices and burnt offerings. The person who knows nothing of all this cannot possibly know the reason why it was commanded to offer young bulls, rams, or he-lambs on 
one occasion, oxen, she-goats, and she-lambs on another, and he-goats, he-kids, and she-kids of she-goats on yet another. What other reason could there be for these differences? For the meaning of animals 
or beasts in the Word as forms of good or evils present with a person, and also truths or falsities, see <a href="142.htm">142</a>, <a href="143.htm">143</a>, <a href="246.htm">246</a>, <a href="714.htm">714</a>, <a href="715.htm">715</a>, <a href="776.htm">776</a>, <a href="1823.htm">1823</a>, <a href="2179.htm">2179</a>, <a href="2180.htm">2180</a>, <a href="2781.htm">2781</a>, <a href="3218.htm">3218</a>, <a href="3519.htm">3519</a>, <a href="5198.htm">5198</a>, <a href="7523.htm">7523</a>, <a href="7872.htm">7872</a>, <a href="9090.htm">9090</a>;

 So far however as sacrifices and burnt offerings of those creatures are concerned it should be recognized 
that,  <a href="1.htm">1</a> Representative worship among the Jewish and Israelite nation consisted first and foremost in sacrifices and burnt offerings.  <a href="2.htm">2</a> Sacrifices and burnt offerings in general served to mean

<p><b>[4]</b>
 But to deal with these considerations in detail,  </p>
<p><a href="1.htm">1</a> Representative worship among the Jewish and Israelite nation consisted first and foremost in sacrifices 
and burnt offerings  This is clear from the fact that they were used for every sin and all guilt, and also for every consecration and admission to office, besides being used daily, on every sabbath, 
at each new moon, and at every feast; and for this reason the altar was the holiest object of all. Every other act of worship among that nation grew out of an occasion for sacrifice, which explains 
why it says in Daniel, when the abolition of representative worship is the subject, that the sacrifice and the offering will cease, <a href="http://bible.gospelcom.net/cgi-bin/bible?passage=Dan%209:27&amp;version=ESV&amp;interface=print&amp;showfn=yes&amp;showxref">Dan 9:27</a>, and the continual [sacrifice] will be removed, <a href="http://bible.gospelcom.net/cgi-bin/bible?passage=Dan%208:10-13;%2011:31;%2012:11&amp;version=ESV&amp;interface=print&amp;showfn=yes&amp;showxref">Dan 8:10-13; 11:31; 12:11</a>. In particular 'the continual' means the sacrifice that was offered daily, and in general all worship. But see what has been shown already on these matters,  </p>

<p><b>[5]</b>
 <a href="2.htm">2</a> Sacrifices and burnt offerings in general served to mean the regeneration of a person by 
means of the truths of faith in the Lord and forms of the good of love to Him, both received from the Lord  This is clear from the fact that all aspects of worship have regard to purification from evils 
and falsities, the implantation of truth and good, and the joining together of these, thus to regeneration since by means of those three a person is regenerated. This explains why sacrifices and 
burnt offerings were offered for every sin and all guilt; and it says, when they were offered, that it was expiated and would be pardoned, <a href="http://bible.gospelcom.net/cgi-bin/bible?passage=Lev%204:20,26,31,35;%205:6,10,13,18;%206:7;%207:7;%2010:17;%2014:18,19&amp;version=ESV&amp;interface=print&amp;showfn=yes&amp;showxref">Lev 4:20,26,31,35; 5:6,10,13,18; 6:7; 7:7; 10:17; 14:18,19</a>; 
15:30,<a href="31.htm">31</a>; 16:6,<a href="24.htm">24</a>; 17:11. The pardoning of sins, expiation, propitiation, and redemption are nothing other than purification from evils and falsities, the implantation of goodness and truth, and the joining 
together of these, which is regeneration, <a href="9076.htm">9076</a>, <a href="9452.htm">9452</a>-<a href="9454.htm">9454</a>, <a href="9937.htm">9937</a>, <a href="9938.htm">9938</a>. The whole process of regeneration is also described by the specific observances belonging to each sacrifice and burnt offering, 
and a clear view of that process emerges when the internal sense is used to unfold the representative elements of it, <a href="10022.htm">10022</a>.  </p>
<p></p>
<p><b>[6]</b>
 In the highest sense sacrifices and burnt offerings serve to 
mean the glorification of the Lord's Human  This is so because all the ritual observances belonging to worship that were established among the Israelite and Jewish nation had regard solely to the Lord; 
thus more than all else the sacrifices and burnt offerings - by which in general everything belonging to worship was represented, as shown above - had regard to Him. Furthermore the only source of 
human regeneration is the Lord, <a href="9486.htm">9486</a>, <a href="9487.htm">9487</a>, <a href="9506.htm">9506</a>, <a href="9715.htm">9715</a>, <a href="9809.htm">9809</a>, <a href="10019.htm">10019</a>. When therefore the Word deals with human regeneration the subject in the highest sense is the glorification of the Lord's Human; for 
the regeneration of a person is an image of the glorification of the Lord, <a href="3138.htm">3138</a>, <a href="3212.htm">3212</a>, <a href="3296.htm">3296</a>, <a href="3490.htm">3490</a>, <a href="4402.htm">4402</a>, <a href="5688.htm">5688</a>. Glorifying His Human implies making it Divine, whereas regenerating a person implies making 
him heavenly, in order that what is Divine and the Lord's may dwell in him.  </p>

 <a href="3.htm">3</a> Everything belonging to worship - all the different things constituting it, thus worship in all its variety - 
was represented by the sacrifices and burnt offerings; and this is why it was decreed that different kinds of living creatures should be used  This is clear from all the different situations for which

<p><b>[8]</b>
 Since sacrifices and burnt offerings were prescribed for

rams, she-goats, and he-kids; and he-lambs, she-lambs, and she-kids of she-goats. Sacrifices and burnt offerings of young bull, ox, and he-goat represented the purification and regeneration of the 
external or natural man; those of ram, she-goat, and he-kid represented the purification and regeneration of the internal or spiritual man; and those of he-lamb, she-lamb, and she-kid of the she-goats 
represented the purification and regeneration of the inmost or celestial man. For there are three degrees that follow in order in a person, namely celestial, spiritual, and natural, see <a href="9992.htm">9992</a>, <a href="10005.htm">10005</a>, 
<a href="10017.htm">10017</a>; and if a person is to be regenerated the things that are internal and those that are external must be regenerated, see the places referred to in <a href="9325.htm">9325</a>(end).  </p>
<p></p>
<p><b>[9]</b>
 But what is meant specifically 
by the sacrifice and burnt offering of a ram that are referred to in the present chapter is clear from places in the Word where sacrifices and burnt offerings of rams are described or where a ram is 
mentioned. From those places it is evident that 'a ram' means the good of innocence and charity in the internal man, and that a sacrifice and burnt offering of it mean purification and regeneration 
of the internal man, and so the implantation of the good of innocence and charity there. This meaning of 'a ram' is clear from the following places: In Isaiah,  </p>
<blockquote>
All the flocks of Arabia will be gathered 
to you, the rams of Nebaioth will minister to you; they will come up with acceptance on My altar. <a href="http://bible.gospelcom.net/cgi-bin/bible?passage=Isa%2060:7&amp;version=ESV&amp;interface=print&amp;showfn=yes&amp;showxref">Isa 60:7</a>.  
</blockquote>
<p>This refers to the Lord, and to heaven and His Church. 'The flocks of Arabia' are 
all the forms of good belonging to the internal man, 'the rams of Nebaioth' are the forms of the good of innocence and charity there, 'flocks' being forms of good that belong to the internal man, see 
<a href="8937.htm">8937</a>, <a href="9135.htm">9135</a>, 'Arabia' a place where good exists, <a href="3268.htm">3268</a>, and 'Nebaioth' those there who are governed by that good, <a href="3268.htm">3268</a>, <a href="3686.htm">3686</a>, <a href="3688.htm">3688</a>.  </p>
<p></p>

<p>This refers to Tyre, by which is meant the Church where cognitions or knowledge of good

good of faith. In the Word reference is made to 'flocks', 'small cattle'<A name="fntext3"></a><A href="#fn3"><sup>c</sup></a>, and 'members of the flock', for which the original language has distinct and separate terms. By 'flocks' internal things 
in general are meant, by 'members of the flock' the same things in particular, and by 'small cattle' inmost things in particular. But by 'herds' external things are meant. In Jeremiah,  </p>
<blockquote>
I will cause 
them to come down like small cattle to the slaughter, like rams with he-goats. <a href="http://bible.gospelcom.net/cgi-bin/bible?passage=Jer%2051:40&amp;version=ESV&amp;interface=print&amp;showfn=yes&amp;showxref">Jer 51:40</a>.

<p>'Small cattle', 'rams', and 'he-goats' here have much the same meaning.  </p>

<p>'Between members of the flock and members of 
the flock' stands for between those with whom interior things of good and of evil are present. 'Between rams and between he-goats' stands for between those with whom charity and consequently faith are 
present and those with whom truths of faith without charity are present. 'Rams' here have the same meaning as 'sheep', rams being male sheep. For the meaning of 'sheep' as those with whom charity and 
consequently faith are present, see <a href="4169.htm">4169</a>, <a href="4809.htm">4809</a>; and for that of 'he-goats' as those with whom truths that are called the truths of faith are present but without charity, <a href="4169.htm">4169</a>(end), <a href="4769.htm">4769</a>. The ram and

</blockquote>
<p>By sacrifices of rams is meant purification of the internal man and the implantation of the good of innocence there; for sin committed 
through error is sin owing to ignorance that has innocence within it, and the innocence of ignorance belongs to the internal man.  </p>

<p><b>[13]</b>
 In the same author,  </p>
<blockquote>
At new moons they were to offer 
two young bulls, one ram, and seven lambs, and afterwards a he-goat of the she-goats. The same thing was to be done every day during Passover, and also on the day of the firstfruits. <a href="http://bible.gospelcom.net/cgi-bin/bible?passage=Num%2028:11,15,19,22,27&amp;version=ESV&amp;interface=print&amp;showfn=yes&amp;showxref">Num 28:11,15,19,22,27</a>,[<a href="30.htm">30</a>.] 
 </p>
<p>All this was done in order that the purification of the whole person - the external, the internal, and the inmost - might be represented. The purification of the external man was represented 
by the sacrifice and burnt offering of the young bulls, of the internal by those of the ram, and of the inmost by those of the lambs. And since purification was represented, so too was the implantation 
of the good of innocence; for a young bull is the good of innocence in the external man, a ram that good in the internal man, and a lamb that good in the inmost man, as has been stated above. 
The reason why the last of the creatures was a he-goat was that 'a he-goat' means the truth of faith in the external man, and the truth of faith there is last and lowest, <a href="9959.htm">9959</a>.

Since the forms of good 
and the truths present with a person follow one another in this order, therefore also the gifts of the princes of Israel when the altar and the tent of meeting were anointed were a young bull, a ram, 
and a lamb for burnt offerings, and a he-goat of the she-goats for a sacrifice, <a href="http://bible.gospelcom.net/cgi-bin/bible?passage=Num%207:15-17,21-23,27-29,33&amp;version=ESV&amp;interface=print&amp;showfn=yes&amp;showxref">Num 7:15-17,21-23,27-29,33</a>ff.  From all this it may now be recognized that 'a ram' means the good of innocence and 
charity in the internal man.

`Et arietem unum accipies': quod significet bonum innocentiae in interno homine, constat ex significatione `arietis' quod sit bonum innocentiae et {1} charitatis in interno homine, de qua sequitur. 
Quoniam in hoc capite de sacrificiis et holocaustis ex {2} arietibus et agnis agitur, dicetur quid per animalia in genere' quae in sacrificia et holocausta offerebantur significatum fuit: illa animalia 
erant boves, juvenci, {3} hirci, arietes, caprae, et haedi atque agni, agnae, et capellae caprarum; qui non scit quid illa animalia significant, nusquam scire potest quid significant sacrificia et holocausta 
ex illis in specie; sciendum est quod omnia animalia quae in terris sunt significent talia quae sunt apud hominem, quae in genere se referunt ad affectiones quae sunt ejus voluntatis, et ad 
cogitationes quae sunt ejus intellectus, ita ad bona et ad vera, nam bona sunt voluntatis et vera sunt intellectus; et quia se referunt ad bona et vera, etiam se referunt ad amorem et ad fidem, nam omnia 
quae amoris sunt vocantur bona, et omnia quae fidei sunt vocantur vera. 	[2] Quod animalia diversi generis talia significent, ducit causam ex repraesentativis in altera vita; ibi apparent animalia 
plurium generum et innumerabilium specierum; talia ibi sunt apparentiae prorsus ad vivum correspondentes affectionibus et cogitationibus quae apud spiritus et angelos; quod ita sit, etiam constare potest 
ex visionibus propheticis passim in Verbo, omnia enim quae prophetis visa sunt, sunt talia quae coram angelis apparent in caelo; inde est quod bestiae in Verbo toties memorentur, et per singulas 
significetur aliquid quod se refert ad talia quae apud hominem, de quibus supra; homo nec aliud est quam animal quoad externum suum hominem sed distinguitur {4} per internum, {5} per quod hic et ille 
elevari possit versus caelum et ad Deum, et inde recipere fidem et amorem;(n) {5} inde est quod (o)bestiae in sacrificiis et holocaustis adhibitae fuerint; qui haec non scit (x)nequaquam scire potest 
cur mandatum fuerit, nunc offerre juvencos, arietes, agnos, nunc boves, capras, et agnas, nunc hircos, haedos, et capellas caprarum {6}; ad quid alioquin talia forent?  quod bestiae in Verbo (x)significent 
bona et mala apud hominem, ut et vera et falsa, videatur n 142, 143, 246, 714, 715, 776, 1823, 2179, 2180, 2781, 3218, 3519, 5198, 7523, 7872, 9090, et quod ideo in sacrificiis adhibitae fuerint, 
n. 1823, 2180, 2805, 2807, 2830. 	[3] {7} Quod autem sacrificia et holocausta ex illis concernit {8} sciendum est, 1.  Quod cultus repraesentativus apud gentem Judaicam et Israeliticam praecipue constiterit 
in sacrificiis et holocaustis, 2.  Quod sacrificia et holocausta in genere significaverint regenerationem hominis per vera fidei et bona amoris a Domino, et in supremo sensu glorificationem 
Humani Domini, 3.  Quod omne cultus per sacrificia et holocausta secundum ejus varia, ita cum omni varietate repraesentatum sit {9}; et quod ideo varia genera animalium mandata fuerint. 	[4] Sed ad 
singula, 	1. Quod cultus repraesentativus apud gentem Judaicam et Israeliticam praecipue constiterit in sacrificiis et holocaustis, constat ex eo quod adhibita fuerint pro omni peccato et pro omni reatu, 
tum pro omni consecratione et {10} inauguratione, et praeterea quovis die, quovis sabbato, quovis novilunio, et quovis festo; et quod ideo altare esset omnium sanctissimum; reliqua cultus apud illam 
gentem pendebant ab illis, idcirco {11} ubi agitur de abolitione cultus repraesentativi apud Danielem, dicitur quod cessabit sacrificium et oblatio, ix 27, et removebitur juge, viii 10-13, xi 31, 
xii 11; per `juge' significatur in specie sacrificium quod fiebat quotidie, et in genere omnis cultus; sed videantur quae de his prius ostensa sunt, quod nempe sacrificia in genere significent omnem cultum 
repraesentativum, n. 923, 2165, 6905, 8680, 8936, quod altare fuerit principale repraesentativum Domini et inde cultus, n. 2777, 2811, 8935, 8940, 9388, 9389, 9714, 9964, quod antiqui ante Eberum 
nihil noverint de sacrificiis, n. 2180, quod ab Ebero, ita apud gentem Hebraeam, et inde apud posteros Jacobi, sacrificia instituta fuerint, et cur, n. (x)1128, 1343, 2180, 2818, quod sacrificia non 
mandata (d)fuerint, sed permissa, n. 2180. 	[5] 2. Quod sacrificia et holocausta in genere significaverint regenerationem hominis per vera fidei et bona amoris (c)in Dominum a Domino, constat ex eo 
quod omnia cultus se referant ad purificationem a malis et falsis, ad implantationem veri et boni, et ad conjunctionem (c)eorum, ita ad regenerationem, nam per tria illa regeneratur homo; inde est quod 
sacrificia et holocausta pro omni peccato et pro omni reatu oblata fuerint; et cum oblata, dicitur quod expiatum et quod condonabitur, Lev. iv 20, 26, 31, 35, v 6, 10, 13, 16, 18, 26 [A.V. v 6, 10, 
13, 18, vi 7], vii 7, x 17, xiv 18, 19, xv 30, 31, xvi 6, 24, xvii 11; condonatio peccatorum, expiatio, propitiatio, et redemptio, nec aliud sunt quam purificatio a malis et falsis, implantatio boni et 
veri, ac conjunctio eorum, ita regeneratio, n. (x)9076, 9452-9454, 9937, 9938; omnis processus regenerationis etiam describitur per ritualia singula cujusvis sacrificii e holocausti, et panditur cum 
evolvuntur repraesentativa per sensum internum, n. 10,022. 	[6] Quod sacrificia et holocausta {12} in sensu supremo significent glorificationem Humani Domini, est quia omnia ritualia cultus instituta 
apuc gentem Israeliticam et Judaicam unice spectabant Dominum, in spectabant Ipsum principaliter sacrificia et holocausta, per quae in genere repraesentabatur omne cultus, (c)ut supra ostensum est; 
etiam regeneratio hominis non aliunde est quam a Domino, n. (a)9486, 9487, 9506: 9715, 9809, 10,019; quapropter ubi in Verbo agitur de regeneratione hominis, in sensu supremo ibi agitur de glorificatione 
Humani Domini: nam regeneratio hominis est imago glorificationis Domini, n. 3138: 3212, 3296, 3490, 4402, 5688; glorificare Humanum est id Divinum facere, regenerare autem (d)hominem est eum {13} 
caelestem facere, ut in illo Divinum Domini habitare possit. 	[7] 3. Quod omne cultus per sacrificia et holocausta secundum ejus varia, varietate, repraesentatum sit, et quod ideo varia genera animalium 
mandata fuerint, constat ex variis pro quibus sacrificia et holocausta, nempe {14} pro peccatis per errorem (o)et pro peccatis non per errorem: pro omni praevaricatione ac immunditie, sive apud sacerdotem, 
sive apud totam contionem, sive apud principem, sive apud (o)aliquam animam: pro mundatione ex lepra: pro purificatione post partum: pro consecratione altaris, tentorii conventus, et omnium 
inibi: pro mundatione eorundem cum Aharon semel quotannis ingrederetur in sanctum sanctorum: pro inauguratione Aharonis et filiorum ejus in sacerdotium: pro consecratione Naziraeorum: (c)et in genere 
in tribus festis, in singulis noviluniis, sabbatis, (o)et diebus mane et inter vesperas, praeter votiva et voluntaria. 	[8] Quia sacrificia et holocausta {15} pro tam variis erant, et per illa repraesentabantur 
varia cultus, ideo etiam varia genera animalium quae (x)offerrentur mandata erant, nempe juvenci, boves, et hirci, arietes, caprae, et haedi, agni, agnae, et capellae caprarum; et per sacrificia 
et holocausta ex juvenco, bove, et hirco, repraesentabatur purificatio (c)et regeneratio externi seu naturalis hominis, ex ariete, capra, et haedo, repraesentabatur purificatio et regeneratio interni 
seu spiritualis hominis, et ex agno, agna, et capella caprarum repraesentabatur purificatio et {16} regeneratIo intimi seu caelestis hominis; quod tria sint quae apud hominem succedunt, caeleste, 
spirituale, et naturale, videatur n. 9992, 10,005, 10,017,et quod homo regenerandus sit quoad interna {17} et quoad externa {18}, ut regeneratus sit, citata n. 9325 fin. 	[9] Quid autem in specie 
significatur {19} per sacrificium et holocaustum ex ariete, de quibus {20} in hoc capite agitur, constat ex locis in Verbo ubi sacrificia et holocausta ex ariete describuntur {21} et ubi aries nominatur; 
ex quibus patet quod per arietem significetur bonum innocentiae et charitatis in interno homine, et per sacrificium et holocaustum ex illo    purificatio et regeneratio interni hominis, ita {22} implantatio 
boni innocentiae et charitatis ibi; quod id per `arietem' significetur {23}, constat a sequentibus his locis: apud Esaiam,      	Omnes greges Arabiae congregabuntur tibi, arietes Nebajoth 
ministrabunt tibi, ascendent ad beneplacitum altare Meum, lx 7; </p>
<p>agitur ibi de Domino, et de caelo (c)ac Ecclesia Ipsius; `greges Arabiae' sunt omnia bona interni hominis, `arietes Nebajoth' sunt bona 
innocentiae et charitatis ibi; quod `greges' sint bona interni hominis, videatur n. 8937, 9135, quod `Arabia' sit ubi bonum, n. 3268, quod `Nebajoth' sint qui ibi in illo, n. 3268, 3686, 3688: [10] apud 
Ezechielem,      	Arabia et omnes principes Kedar, negotiatores manus tuae per pecora, et arietes, et hircos, xxvii 21; </p>
<p>ibi de Tyro, per quam significatur (o)Ecclesia ubi cognitiones boni et veri 
n. 1201; `negotiatores' sunt qui habent illas et communicant, n. 2967, 4453, `pecora' sunt bona amoris, `arietes' sunt bona charitatis, et `hirci' sunt bona fidei; (m)in Verbo dicuntur greges, pecora, 
et pecudes {24}, quae in lingua originali distinguuntur per sua nomina; et per `greges' significantur in genere interna, per `pecudes' eadem in specie {25}, et per `pecora' intima {26} in specie; per 
`armenta' autem externa:(n) apud Jeremiam,      	Descendere faciam eos sicut pecora ad mactandum, arietes cum hircis, li (x)40; </p>
<p>[11] per `pecora', `arietes,' et `hircos' hic similia significantur 
{27}: apud Ezechielem,      	Sic dixit Dominus Jehovih, Ecce Ego judicans inter pecudes et pecudes {28}, et inter arietes et inter hircos, xxxiv 17; </p>
<p>`inter pecudes et pecudes' pro inter illos qui in 
interioribus boni et mali {29}, `inter arietes et inter hircos' pro inter illos qui in charitate (o)et inde fide, et (o)inter illos qui in veris fidei {30} absque charitate {31}; (o)`arietes' hic simile 
significant quod `oves,' nam arietes sunt masculi ovium; quod `oves' sint qui in charitate et inde fide, videatur n. 4169, 4809,' et quod `hirci' sint qui in veris quae fidei dicuntur absque charitate 
{32}, n. 4169 fin., 4769; similia per arietem et hircum significantur apud Danielem viii; 1-fin {33}, et similia per oves et hircos apud Matthaeum xxv 32-fin.: [12] apud Moschen,      	Si anima 
peccaverit per errorem, adducet reatum suum Jehovae arietem integrum de grege, Lev. v 15, 18, 25 [A.V. v 15, 18, vi 6]; </p>
<p>per sacrificia {34} ex ariete significatur purificatio interni hominis et implantatio 
boni innocentiae ibi, nam peccatum per errorem est peccatum ex ignorantia in qua innocentia, ac innocentia ignorantiae est interni hominis: [13] apud eundem,      	Quod in noviluniis offerrent 
duos juvencos, unum arietem, et septem agnos; et postea hircum caprarum.' similiter diebus singulis Paschatis : et similiter die primitiarum, Num. xxviii 11, 15, 19, 22, 27; </p>
<p>hoc erat ut repraesentaretur 
purificatio totius hominis, tam externi, interni, ac intimi, per sacrificium et holocaustum ex juvencis purificatio externi hominis, ex ariete purificatio interni, et ex agnis purificatio intimi; 
et quia purificatio, etiam implantatio boni innocentiae repraesentabatur {35}, nam juvencus est bonum innocentiae in externo homine, aries in interno, et agnus in intimo, ut supra dictum (o)est; quod 
ultimum eorum esset hircus, erat quia per `hircum' significatur verum fidei in externo homine, et verum fidei ibi est ultimum, n. 9959. Quia bona et vera apud hominem in eo ordine sequuntur, ideo quoque 
munera principum Israelis, cum ungebatur altare et tentorium conventus, erant juvencus, aries, et agnus in holocausta, et hircus caprarum in sacrificium {36}, Num. vii 15-17, 21-23, 27-29, 33 seq.
