<h3 align="center" class="ired">属天的奥秘 第1745节</h3>
<h4 align="center"></h4><p><strong>1745.</strong>“我已经向耶和华起誓”表主的心境。这从“起誓”的含义清楚可知。众所周知，向耶和华起誓是与内心情感相对应的身体行为。就字义而言，那些内在或属心智的事物通过相应的外在事物来表达；但就内义而言，所表示的却是内在事物。所以，此处的“起誓”表心智或内心的情感。<br />只要主处于试探状态，祂与耶和华说话，就像和别人说话一样。但只要其人性本质联结于其神性本质，祂与耶和华说话，就像和自己说话一样。这从福音书、以及先知书和大卫诗篇中的许多经文非常清楚地看出来。其原因从有关来自母亲的遗传物的论述明显可知。只要这种遗传物存留，可以说祂就远离耶和华；但只要这种遗传物被根除，祂就与耶和华在一起，其实就是耶和华祂自己。<br />主与天使的结合有助于说明这一点：有时，天使说话并非通过自己，而是通过主。在这种时候，他只知道他是主，不知道别的。不过，这时，他的外在处于休眠状态。但当他的外在活跃时，情况就不同了。原因在于，天使的内在人被主占有，并且他自己的东西越不形成阻碍，这内在人越是主的，甚至就是主。然而，主与耶和华的结合是无限的，永恒的，以致祂的人性本质也是耶和华。</p>

<p><strong>[NCE]1745.</strong> I have lifted my hand to Jehovah symbolizes the mind the Lord had, as can be seen from the symbolism of lifting one's hands. Lifting one's hand to Jehovah is a physical gesture corresponding to a state of mind, as everyone knows. The literal meaning is expressing intermediate characteristics (that is, characteristics of the mind) through external images that correspond to them, but it is inner things that are meant in the inner sense. The lifting of Abram's hand, then, is a mindset or state of mind.<br />[2] As long as the Lord was being tested, he talked to Jehovah as a separate person, but so far as his human quality became one with his divine quality, he talked to Jehovah as identical with himself. Many passages in the Gospels and many passages in the prophets and David offer evidence for this.{*1} The reason for it stands out clearly from previous remarks about the Lord's heredity from his mother [<a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_1745/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_1414" target=_top>1414</a>, <a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_1745/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_1444" target=_top>1444:1-2</a>, <a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_1745/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_1573" target=_top>1573</a>]. To the extent that any of that heredity remained, he felt absent from Jehovah; but to the extent that it was rooted out, he was present with and was himself Jehovah.<br />[3] This can be illustrated by the bond between the Lord and the angels. Sometimes angels speak not for themselves but for the Lord. When they do, they have no idea they are not the Lord; but their superficial traits are being suppressed. It is different when their outward traits are active. Their inner self is the Lord's possession, and so far as anything of their own does not get in the way in such a situation, their inner self belongs to the Lord and in fact is the Lord.<br />The Lord, however, achieved full union or eternal oneness with Jehovah, so that his human nature itself is also Jehovah.<br /><br /><strong>Footnotes:</strong><br />{*1} Passages from the Gospels, the prophets, and Psalms that might be seen as prayers expressing Jesus' distress are <a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_1745/bible_king-james-version_matthew_26_39" target=_top>Matthew 26:39</a>, <a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_1745/bible_king-james-version_matthew_26_42" target=_top>42</a>; <a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_1745/bible_king-james-version_matthew_27_46" target=_top>27:46</a>; <a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_1745/bible_king-james-version_mark_14_36" target=_top>Mark 14:36</a>; <a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_1745/bible_king-james-version_mark_15_34" target=_top>15:34</a>; <a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_1745/bible_king-james-version_luke_22_42" target=_top>Luke 22:42</a>; <a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_1745/bible_king-james-version_luke_23_46" target=_top>23:46</a>; <a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_1745/bible_king-james-version_jeremiah_15_15-18" target=_top>Jeremiah 15:15-18</a>; <a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_1745/bible_king-james-version_lamentations_3_55-56" target=_top>Lamentations 3:55-56</a>; <a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_1745/bible_king-james-version_jonah_2_2-9" target=_top>Jonah 2:2-9</a>; <a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_1745/bible_king-james-version_habakkuk_1_2-4" target=_top>Habakkuk 1:2-4</a>; <a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_1745/bible_king-james-version_habakkuk_1-2_12-1" target=_top>1:12-2:1</a>; <a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_1745/bible_king-james-version_habakkuk_3_2" target=_top>3:2</a>; and in Psalms, chapters <a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_1745/bible_king-james-version_psalms_6_1-10" target=_top>6</a>; <a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_1745/bible_king-james-version_psalms_22_1-31" target=_top>22</a>; <a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_1745/bible_king-james-version_psalms_38_1-22" target=_top>38</a>; <a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_1745/bible_king-james-version_psalms_69_1-36" target=_top>69</a>; <a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_1745/bible_king-james-version_psalms_88_1-18" target=_top>88</a>.

I have lifted up my hand to Jehovah. That this signifies the state of mind in the Lord, is evident from the signification of "lifting up the hands." The lifting up of the hand to Jehovah is a gesture 
of the body corresponding to an affection of the mind, as is well known. In the sense of the letter, those things which are interior, or of the mind, are expressed by external things which correspond; 
but in the internal sense it is internal things that are meant; here therefore the lifting up of the hand means the mind, or an affection of the mind.  [2] So long as the Lord was in a state of temptations, 
He spoke with Jehovah as with another; but so far as His Human Essence was united to, He spoke with Jehovah as with Himself; which is evident from many passages in the Gospels, as also from 
many in the Prophets and in David. The cause is clearly evident from what has been said before concerning the inheritance from the mother. So far as this remained, He was as it were absent from Jehovah; 
but so far as this was extirpated, He was present, and was Jehovah Himself.  [3] This may be illustrated by the conjunction of the Lord with the angels. Sometimes an angel does not speak from himself, 
but from the Lord, and he then does not know but that he is the Lord; but then his externals are quiescent. It is otherwise when his externals are active. The reason is, that the internal man of 
the angels is the Lord's possession; and so far then as there are no obstructions on the part of what is their own, it is the Lord's, and even is the Lord. But in the Lord, a plenary conjunction or an 
eternal union with Jehovah was wrought, so that His very Human Essence also is Jehovah. </p>

<p align="center"><b>Elliott(1983-1999) 1745</b></p><p><b>1745.</b>
That 'I have lifted up my hand to Jehovah' means the Lord's frame of mind is clear from the meaning of 'lifting up the hand'. Lifting up the hand to Jehovah, as is well known, is an action of the body 
corresponding to an affection of the mind. In the sense of the letter things that are interior, or belonging to the mind, are expressed by means of external things that correspond, but in the internal 
sense it is the internal things that are meant. Here therefore 'lifting up the hand' is the mind or affection of the mind. </p>
<p></p>
<p><b>[2]</b>
 As long as the Lord was in a state of temptations He spoke to Jehovah 
as though to another; but insofar as His Human Essence had been united to His Divine Essence He spoke to Jehovah as to Himself. This is clear from many places in the Gospels, and also from many in 
the Prophets and in David. The reason is quite clear from what has been stated already about that which was inherited from the mother. Insofar as this remained He was so to speak absent from Jehovah; 
but insofar as it had been eradicated He was present with and was Jehovah Himself. </p>
<p></p>
<p><b>[3]</b>
 The Lord's conjunction with angels may serve to illustrate the point: sometimes an angel does not speak from himself 
but from the Lord, and at such times he does not know otherwise than that he is the Lord; but at those times his externals are Lying dormant. It is different when the externals are active. The 
reason for this is that the angers' infernal man is the possession of the Lord, and to the extent that things which are their own do not get in the way, it is the Lord's and indeed is the Lord. With the 
Lord however complete conjunction, or an eternal union with Jehovah, was effected, so that His Human Essence as well is Jehovah. </p>

'Elevavi manum meam ad Jehovam': quod significet mentem qualis erat apud Dominum, constat a significatione 'elevare manus'; elevatio manus ad Jehovam est gestus corporis correspondens mentis affectioni, 
ut notum est; in sensu litterae exprimuntur illa quae interiora seu mentis sunt per externa quae correspondent, sed in sensu interno sunt interna quae intelliguntur; hic ideo 'elevatio manus' est 
mens seu affectio mentis.  [2] Quamdiu Dominus fuit in statu tentationum, locutus est cum Jehovah sicut cum alio, sed quantum Essentia Ipsius Humana unita fuit Ipsius Divinae, tantum locutus est cum 
Jehovah ut cum Semet; quod constat a multis apud Evangelistas, tum quoque a multis apud Prophetas, et apud Davidem; causa manifeste constat ex illis quae prius dicta sunt de hereditario a matre: quantum 
ex hoc mansit, tantum fuit quasi absens a Jehovah; at quantam hoc exstirpatum, tantum fuit praesens et Ipse Jehovah.  [3] Illustrari hoc potest a conjunctione Domini cum angelis: angelus quandoque 
loquitur non a se sed a Domino, et tunc non aliter scit quam quod is Dominus sit, sed tunc quiescunt illius externa; aliter cum externa operantur; causa est quod internus illorum homo sit possessio Domini, 
et quantum tunc non propria impediunt, tantum est Domini, immo Dominus. Sed apud Dominum facta est conjunctio plenaria seu unio aeterna cum Jehovah, sic ut ipsa Humana Ipsius Essentia sit quoque Jehovah. </p>
