<h3 align="center" class="ired">属天的奥秘 第10596节</h3>
<h4 align="center"></h4><p><strong>10596</strong>.人死后的生命就是他的爱之生命和他的信之生命。因此，他活在世上时，他的爱如何，他的信如何，那么他的生命就永远如何。地狱的生命是那些爱自己爱世界高于一切之人的命运；天堂的生命是那些爱神高于一切，爱邻如己之人的命运。后者是那些拥有信的人，而前者是那些没有信的人。天堂的生命就是那被称为永生的；地狱的生命则是那被称为属灵死亡的。</p>

<p align="center"><b>Potts(1905-1910) 10596</b></p><p><b>10596.</b>
The life of man after death is the life of his love, and the life of his faith; consequently such as has been his love, and such as has been his faith, during his life in the world, such his life remains 
forever. The life of hell is for those who have loved themselves and the world above all things; and the life of heaven for those who have loved God above all things and the neighbor as themselves. 
These are they who have faith; but the former are they who have not faith. The life of heaven is what is called eternal life; and the life of hell is what is called spiritual death. </p>

<p align="center"><b>Elliott(1983-1999) 10596</b></p><p><b>10596.</b>
A person's life after death consists in the life of his love and the life of his faith. Therefore what his love has been like and what his faith has been like while he lived in the world determines what 
kind of life will be his for evermore. The life of hell is the lot of those who have loved themselves and the world above all things, and the life of heaven that of those who have loved God above 
all things and their neighbour as themselves. The latter are those who possess faith, but the former those who do not. The life of heaven is what is called eternal life, and the life of hell is what is 
called spiritual death.  </p>

<p align="center"><b>Latin(1748-1756) 10596</b>
</p><b>10596.</b>
Vita hominis post mortem est vita amoris et vita fidei ejus; inde qualis ei amor fuerat et qualis ei fides cum vixit in mundo, talis ei vita manet in aeternum; vita inferni est illis qui se et mundum 
super omnia amaverunt; et vita caeli est illis qui Deum super omnia amaverunt, ac proximum sicut seipsum; hi sunt qui fidem habent, illi autem qui fidem non habent; vita caeli est quae vocatur vita 
aeterna; et vita inferni est quae vocatur mors spiritualis. </p>
