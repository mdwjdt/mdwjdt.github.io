THE INTERNAL SENSE.      Verses 1-4. And afterward Moses and Aaron came, and said unto Pharaoh, Thus said Jehovah the God of Israel, Let My people go, that they may hold a feast to Me in the wilderness. 
And Pharaoh said, Who is Jehovah whose voice I should hear, to let Israel go? I know not Jehovah, and also I will not let Israel go. And they said, The God of the Hebrews hath met with us; let us 
go we pray, a way of three days into the wilderness, and let us sacrifice to Jehovah our God; lest He fall upon us with pestilence, or with the sword. And the king of Egypt said unto them, Wherefore 
do ye, Moses and Aaron, draw away the people from their works? Go ye unto your burdens. "And afterward Moses and Aaron came," signifies the Divine law and doctrine thence derived; "and said unto Pharaoh," 
signifies exhortation thence to those who are against the truths of the church; "Thus said Jehovah the God of Israel," signifies that it was from the Divine Human of the Lord; "Let My people go," 
signifies that they should desist from infesting them; "that they may hold a feast to Me in the wilderness," signifies that from a glad mind they may worship the Lord in the obscurity of faith in which 
they are; "and Pharaoh said," signifies contrary thought; "who is Jehovah, whose voice I should hear?" signifies concerning the Lord, to whose exhortation they should hearken; "to let Israel go," signifies 
that they should desist; "I know not Jehovah," signifies that they care not for the Lord; "and also I will not let Israel go," signifies that neither will they desist from infesting; "and they 
said, The God of the Hebrews hath met with us," signifies that the God Himself of the church has commanded; "let us go we pray a way of three days into the wilderness," signifies that they must be in 
a state quite removed from falsities, although in the obscurity of faith; "and let us sacrifice to Jehovah our God," signifies that they may worship the Lord; "lest He fall upon us with pestilence, 
or with the sword," signifies to avoid damnation of evil and falsity; "and the king of Egypt said unto them," signifies the answer from those who are in falsities; "wherefore do ye, Moses and Aaron, draw 
away the people from their works?" signifies that their Divine law and doctrine will not release them from sufferings; "go ye unto your burdens," signifies that they must live in combats. </p>

THE INTERNAL SENSE Verses 1-4 And afterwards Moses and Aaron came and said to Pharaoh, Thus said Jehovah, the God of Israel, Send My people away, and let them hold a feast to Me in the wilderness. And 
Pharaoh said, Who is Jehovah whose voice I am to hear, [telling me] to send Israel away? I do not know Jehovah, and moreover I will not send Israel away. And they said, The God of the Hebrews has met 
us; let us go, we beg you, a way of three days<A name="fntext1"></a><A href="#fn1"><sup>a</sup></a> into the wilderness, and sacrifice to Jehovah our God, lest perhaps He fall on us with pestilence or sword. And the king of Egypt said to them, Why, 
O Moses and Aaron, do you draw the people away from their work?<A name="fntext2"></a><A href="#fn2"><sup>b</sup></a> Go to your burdens!  </p>
<p>'And afterwards Moses and Aaron came' means the Divine Law and the teachings derived from it. 'And said to Pharaoh' 
means an admonition from them to those who are opposed to the Church's truths. 'Thus said Jehovah, the God of Israel' means that it comes from the Lord's Divine Human. 'Send My people away' means 
that they should leave off molesting them. 'And let them hold a feast to Me in the wilderness' means in order that they may worship the Lord with gladness of mind, in the obscurity of faith they live 
in. 'And Pharaoh said' means thinking that was of a contrary nature. 'Who is Jehovah whose voice I am to hear' means regarding the Lord whose admonition they should listen to. 'To send the people away?' 
means to leave off [molesting them].'I do not know Jehovah' means that they have no interest in the Lord. 'And moreover I will not send Israel away' means that neither are they going to leave off 
molesting. 'And they said, The God of the Hebrews has met us' means that the God of the Church has Himself issued the command. 'Let us go, we beg you, a way of three days in the wilderness' means that 
they must be in a state completely removed from falsities, even though they live in obscurity of faith. 'And sacrifice to Jehovah our God' means in order that they may worship the Lord. 'Lest perhaps 
He fall on us with pestilence and sword' means to avoid the damnation of evil and falsity. 'And the king of Egypt said to them' means the reply from those steeped in falsities. 'Why, O Moses and Aaron, 
do you draw the people away from their work?' means that their Divine Law and doctrinal teachings must not exempt them from hardship. 'Go to your burdens!' means that they must lead lives involving 
conflict.

<p>Vers. 1-4.  Et postea venerunt Moscheh et Aharon, et dixerunt ad Pharaonem, Ita dixit Jehovah, Deus Israelis, (x)Dimitte populum Meum, et festum agant Mihi in deserto.  Et dixit Pharao, 
Quis Jehovah Cujus audiam vocem, ad dimittendum Israelem? non novi Jehovam, et etiam Israelem non dimittam.  Et dixerunt, Deus Hebraeorum occurrit nobis; eamus quaeso viam trium dierum in desertum, 
et sacrificemus Jehovae Deo nostro, ne forte incidat in nos peste vel gladio.  Et dixit ad illos rex Aegypti, Quare, Mosche et Aharon, abstrahitis populum ab operibus ejus? ite ad onera vestra.

significat ut desistant: `non novi Jehovam' significat quod Dominum non curent: `et etiam Israelem non dimittam' significat quod nec desistent ab infestando: `et dixerunt, Deus Hebraeorum occurrit nobis' 
significat quod Ipse Deus Ecclesiae mandaverit: `eamus quaeso viam trium dierum in deserto' significat quod erunt in statu prorsus remoto a falsis, tametsi in obscuro fidei: `et sacrificemus Jehovae 
Deo nostro' significat ut colant Dominum: (m)`ne forte incidat in nos peste et gladio' significat ad evitandum damnationem mali et falsi:(n) `et dixit ad illos rex Aegypti' significat responsum ab
