<h3 align="center" class="ired">属天的奥秘 第7796节</h3>
<h4 align="center"></h4><p><strong>7796.</strong>“摩西、亚伦在法老面前行了这一切奇事”表这些荒凉的阶段和随之对他们陷入邪恶的确证通过从神发出的真理实现。这从“摩西、亚伦”的代表和在埃及或“在法老面前所行的奇事”的含义清楚可知：“摩西、亚伦”是指神之真理，“摩西”是指直接从神发出的真理，“亚伦”是指间接发出的真理（参看<a href="7010.htm">7010</a>，<a href="7089.htm">7089</a>，<a href="7382.htm">7382</a>节）；在埃及或“在法老面前所行的奇事”是指那些曾属于教会，却过着邪恶生活之人的众多荒凉阶段。“埃及的奇事”具有这种含义，这一点从每个奇事的含义可以看出来。它们也是这些人没有信，而是被邪恶主宰的确证（参看刚才<a href="7795.htm">7795</a>节）。经上说“摩西、亚伦行了这一切奇事”，而事实上，这些奇事不是他们，而是神行出的。但之所以如此说，是因为“摩西和亚伦”代表神之真理，奇事是由神通过从祂自己发出的真理来行的；因为神自己所行的一切事都是通过从祂自己发出的真理来行的。神自己就是一切事物的存在（或实体），而从祂发出的真理是一切事物的显现（或彰显）；良善本身，也就是神的存在（或实体）通过它的真理产生一切事物。荒凉的阶段通过从神发出的真理实现这句话要这样来理解，神性真理不是它们的原因，因为神不使任何人荒凉。相反，是恶人通过顽固反对神的真理，清除、弃绝或败坏它，并通过将不断流入的神之良善变成邪恶而使自己荒凉。此时，这邪恶就是那使他荒凉的；由此明显可知，它的原因在哪里，即：来自神的良善和真理的流注不是原因，因为没有它们的流注，就没有生命；原因是他们转变为邪恶和虚假，这就是陷入邪恶的人所行的事。</p>

And Moses and Aaron did all these wonders before Pharaoh. That this signifies that these vastations, and the consequent confirmations that they were in evil, were effected by means of truth from the 
Divine, is evident from the representation of Moses and Aaron, as being truth Divine, Moses the truth which proceeds immediately from the Divine, and Aaron the truth which proceeds mediately (see n. 7010, 
7089, 7382); and from the signification of the "wonders done in Egypt" or "before Pharaoh," as being so many vastations of those who had been of the church and had lived evilly. That the "wonders 
of Egypt" have this signification can be seen from the signification of the several wonders; that they are also confirmations that they are not in faith but in evil, see just above (n. 7795). It is said 
that "Moses and Aaron did these wonders," when yet they were not done by them, but by the Divine; but it is so said because by Moses and Aaron is represented truth Divine, and the wonders were wrought 
by the Divine by means of truth proceeding from Itself; for all things which are done by the Divine Itself are done by means of truth proceeding from Itself; the Divine Itself is the being [esse] 
of all things, whereas the truth proceeding from It is the derivative manifestation [existere] of all things; Good Itself, which is the Divine Esse, produces all things by means of its truth. It is said 
that vastations are effected by means of truth from the Divine, but it is to be understood that Divine truth is not the cause, for the Divine vastates no one; but the evil person vastates himself 
by rendering himself determined against truth Divine, extinguishing, rejecting, or perverting it; and by turning the good Divine which continually flows in, into evil. This evil then is that which vastates, 
and from this it is evident whence the cause is, namely, that the influx of good and of truth from the Divine is not the cause, for without the influx of these there is no life; but the cause is 
their conversion into evil and falsity, which is done by him who is in evil. </p>

'And Moses and Aaron performed all these wonders before Pharaoh' means that these stages of vastation, and the consequent corroborations that they are ruled by evil, were brought about by the truth emanating 
from God. This is clear from the representation of 'Moses and Aaron' as God's truth, 'Moses' truth that emanates directly from God, and 'Aaron' that which does so indirectly, dealt with in <a href="7010.htm">7010</a>, <a href="7089.htm">7089</a>, <a href="7382.htm">7382</a>; and from the meaning of the wonders' performed in Egypt or belonging to the Church who have led an evil life. The fact that those things are depicted by the wonders of Egypt may be recognized 
from the meaning of each wonder. And for the fact that they also depict corroborations that those people do not have faith but are ruled by evil, see immediately above in <a href="7795.htm">7795</a>. It says that 'Moses 
and Aaron performed these wonders', when in fact they were not Performed by them but by God. But what happened has been stated in that way because God's truth is represented by 'Moses and Aaron', 
and the wonders were performed by God through the truth emanating from Himself, since all that God Himself performs is performed through the truth emanating from Him. God Himself is the Being (Esse) 
of all things, but the truth emanating from Him is the Coming-into-Being (Existere) of all things, which rises out of His Being. Good itself, which is God's Being (Esse), brings forth all things by means 
of its Truth. It is said that the stages of vastation were brought about by the truth emanating from God; but it should be understood that Divine Truth is not the cause of them since God subjects 
no one to vastation. Rather, an evil person subjects himself to it through obstinate opposition to God's truth by eliminating, rejecting, or perverting it, and through turning God's goodness, which flows 
in unceasingly, into evil. This then is what subjects him to vastation; and from this it is evident where the cause of it lies, not in the inflow of goodness and truth from God - for unless they inflow 
life is non-existent - but in their conversion to evil and falsity, committed by the person who is ruled by evil. </p>

`Et Moscheh et Aharon fecerunt omnia prodigia illa coram Pharaone': quod significet quod vastationes illae, et inde confirmationes quod in malo sint, factae sint per verum procedens a Divino, constat 
ex repraesentatione `Moschis et Aharonis' quod sint verum Divinum, `Moscheh' verum quod immediate procedit a Divino, et `Aharon' quod mediate, de qua n. 7010, 7089, 7382; et ex significatione `prodigiorum 
quae facta in Aegypto seu coram Pharaone' quod sint totidem vastationes illorum qui ab Ecclesia et male vixerunt; quod prodigia Aegypti sint illa, constare potest a significatione cujusvis prodigii; 
{1}quod etiam sint confirmationes quod {2}non in fide sed in malo sint, videatur mox supra, n. 7795.  Dicitur quod `Moscheh et Aharon fecerint prodigia illa,' cum tamen non ab illis sed a Divino 
facta sunt; sed ita dictum est quia per `Moschen et Aharonem' repraesentatur verum Divinum, et {3}prodigia a Divino per verum ab Ipso procedens facta sunt; omnia enim quae fiunt ab Ipso Divino {4}fiunt 
per verum ab Ipso procedens; Ipsum Divinum est Esse omnium, at verum procedens ab Ipso est inde Existere omnium; Ipsum Bonum, quod est Esse Divinum, omnia producit per Verum suum.  {5}Dicitur quod 
vastationes factae sint per verum a Divino sed intelligendum quod Divinum Verum non sit causa, Divinum enim neminem vastat; sed malus ipse semet vastat, per id quod obstinet se contra verum Divinum, id 
exstinguendo, vel rejiciendo, vel pervertendo, et quod vertat bonum Divinum, quod continue influit, in malum, hoc tunc est quod vastat; inde patet unde causa quod non sit influxus boni et veri a Divino 
causa, nam absque influxu illorum nulla est vita, sed est conversio illorum in malum et falsum, quod fit ab illo qui in malo est. 	@1 et quod$ 	@2 illi$ 	@3 illa$ 	@4 hoc fit$ 	@5 Sed usque a 
Divino Bono seu Divino Esse fiunt omnia, nam verum Divinum est Bonum seu Esse Divinum in tali forma, ut omnia produci possint; inde est, cum dicitur quod verum Divinum producat, intelligendum quod bonum 
Divinum producat per verum procedens ab Ipso.  Vastationes malorum non fiunt per verum Divinum, ut a causa, nam Divinum neminem vastat, (m)sed fiunt ab ipsis malis, quod resistant vero Divino et illud 
apud se vel exstinguant, vel rejiciant, vel pervertant; effectus inde est quod vastantur, quod fit per verum Divinum quod influit, sed absque ulla ejus causa, nam absque vero Divino nulla vita$ </p>
