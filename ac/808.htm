<h3 align="center" class="ired">属天的奥秘 第808节</h3>
<h4 align="center"></h4><p><strong>808.</strong>“祂除灭了一切实体”表属于我欲（self-love）的欲望。这一点从下文清楚可知，那里通过代表物描述了它们。“实体”论及意愿之物，因为人的一切事物皆源自意愿，即通过意愿生成并持续存在。意愿正是人的实体，或人自己。大洪水前之人的欲望出于我欲。实际上，恶欲通常有两类，一类属我欲，另一类属物欲。人所渴望的，无非是他所爱的一切，因此，欲望属于他的爱。对大洪水前的人而言，我欲居于主导地位，所以欲望属于它。因为他们如此爱自己，以致将自己奉为神明，认为没有其它神能胜过他们自己。并且他们对此深信不疑。</p>

<p><strong>[NCE]808.</strong> The symbolism of all substance was obliterated as cravings, which are a product of self-love, is established by the next few phrases, which describe the cravings through the creatures that represent them. Substance has to do with matters of the will, because in human beings, everything rises out of the will, that is to say, everything emerges from the will and feeds off it. The will is a person's real substance, a person's real self.<br />The cravings or corrupt desires of the pre-Flood people grew out of self-love. There are two very broad categories of selfish desire; one has to do with self-love, the other with love of worldly gain. We can crave only what we love, so cravings are a matter of love. The pre-Flood people were dominated by self-love and therefore by the appetites connected with it. They loved themselves so intensely that they considered themselves gods, not acknowledging any god higher than themselves. This was their conviction. </p>

And he destroyed every substance. That this signifies cupidities which are of the love of self, is evident from what follows, where they are described by representatives. "Substance" is predicated of 
the things of the will, because from the will all things with man arise, that is, come into existence and subsist. The will is the very substance of man, or the man himself. The cupidities of the antediluvians 
were of the love of self. There are two most universal kinds of cupidities: one kind belongs to the love of self, the other to the love of the world. A man desires nothing else than what he 
loves, and therefore cupidities belong to his love. With these men the love of self reigned, and consequently its cupidities. For they so loved themselves that they believed themselves to be gods, not 
acknowledging any God above themselves; and of this they persuaded themselves. </p>

'He wiped out every being'<A name="fntext1"></a><A href="#fn1"><sup>a</sup></a> means the desires which belong to self-love. This is clear from what follows where they are described by means of representatives. 'Substance' has reference to things of the 
will, for it is from the will that all things with man originate, that is, come into being and remain in being. The will is man's very being, or the person himself. The desires of the people before 
the Flood were those belonging to self-love. Actually there are two very general kinds of evil desires, the first kind being those of self-love, the second those of love of the world. The object of man's 
desire being nothing other than what he loves, desires therefore belong to love. With the people before the Flood self-love reigned and consequently the desires belonging to it. In fact they so loved 
themselves that they imagined they were gods, and acknowledged no other god superior to themselves. And they persuaded themselves that this was so.

</p><b>808.</b>
'Delevit omnem substantiam': quod significet cupiditates quae amoris sui, constat a sequentibus, ubi describuntur per repraesentativa; 'substantia' praedicatur de voluntariis, quia a voluntate omnia 
exsurgunt, seu existunt et subsistunt, apud hominem; voluntas est ipsa substantia hominis, seu ipse homo. Cupiditates antediluvianorum fuerant amoris sui; sunt bina cupiditatum genera universalissima; 
unum est amoris sui, alterum est amoris mundi; homo nihil aliud cupit quam quod amat, quare cupiditates sunt amoris; apud hos regnabat amor sui, proinde ejus cupiditates; ita enim semet amarunt ut putavissent 
se deos esse, non agnoscentes aliquem deum supra se; de eo sibi persuaserunt. </p>
