<h3 align="center" class="ired">属天的奥秘 第9704节</h3>
<h4 align="center"></h4><p><strong>9704.</strong>当一个人聪明地思考、智慧地意愿时，他是出于内在人思考和意愿的；但当他不聪明地思考、不智慧地意愿时，就不是出于内在人思考和意愿的。因此，当一个人对主和属主的东西持有正确、良善的思维，对邻舍和属邻舍的东西也持有正确、良善的思维时，并且当他对这一切的意愿也是正确和良善的时，他的思维和意愿就来源于内在人。但当一个人对这些的思维是错误、邪恶的时，他的思维和意愿就不是来源于内在人。正确的思维是信仰真理的产物，正确的意愿是热爱良善的产物。但错误的思维则是信仰虚假的产物，错误的意愿是热爱邪恶的产物。</p>

<p align="center"><b>Potts(1905-1910) 9704</b></p><p><b>9704.</b>
When a man thinks intelligently and wills wisely, he thinks and wills from the Internal Man; but when he does not think intelligently and will wisely, he does not think and will from the Internal Man. 
Consequently, when a man thinks well about the Lord and about what belongs to the Lord, and when he thinks well about the neighbor and what belongs to the neighbor, and when he also wills well to these, 
he then thinks and wills from the Internal Man. But when a man thinks evilly in regard to these, and bears them ill will, he then does not think and will from the Internal Man. To think well is from 
the faith of truth, and to will well is from the love of good; but to think evilly is from the faith of what is false, and to will evilly is from the love of what is evil. </p>

<p align="center"><b>Elliott(1983-1999) 9704</b></p><p><b>9704.</b>
When intelligence permeates what a person thinks and wisdom what he wills, thought and will spring from the internal man; but when intelligence does not permeate what a person thinks nor wisdom what 
he wills, thought and will do not spring from the internal man. Consequently when a person's thought about the Lord and things that are the Lord's is right and good, and his thought about the neighbour 
and things that are the neighbour's is right and good, and when his will in regard to all this is right and good, his thought and will spring from the internal man. But when a person's thought about 
them is wrong and bad, and his will is wrong and bad, his thought and will do not spring from the internal man. Right thinking is a product of belief in what is true, and right willing a product of the 
love of what is good. But wrong thinking is a product of belief in what is false, and wrong willing a product of the love of what is evil.  </p>

<p align="center"><b>Latin(1748-1756) 9704</b>
</p><b>9704.</b>
Cum homo intelligenter cogitat et sapienter vult, tunc cogitat et vult ab interno, at cum homo non intelligenter cogitat et non sapienter vult, tunc non cogitat et vult ab interno. Consequenter cum 
homo bene de Domino, et de illis quae Domini sunt, et cum bene de proximo, ac de illis quae proximi sunt, cogitat, et illis bene vult, tunc cogitat et vult ab interno; at cum homo male de illis cogitat, 
et male illis vult, tunc non cogitat et vult ab interno.  Bene cogitare est ex fide veri; et bene velle est ex amore boni, at male cogitare est ex fide falsi, et male velle est ex amore mali. </p>
