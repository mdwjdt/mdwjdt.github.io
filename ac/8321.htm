<h3 align="center" class="ired">属天的奥秘 第8321节</h3>
<h4 align="center"></h4><p><strong>8321.</strong>“等候你的百姓过去”表因此无需冒着侵扰的危险，凡能接受良善之真理和真理之良善的人都会得救。这从“过去”的含义清楚可知，“过去”是指无需冒着侵扰的危险就会得救；因为当那些沉浸于邪恶所生的虚假，并进行侵扰的人被投入地狱离开时，再没有人通过注入虚假和邪恶来进行阻挠，并由此阻止接受来自主的良善和真理。这些就是此处“过去”所表示的事；因为只要恶人没有被投入地狱，几乎没有人能“过去”，也就是得救。那时，恶人在那些正进入来世的人当中不断激起邪恶和虚假，由此使他们远离良善和真理。因此，为叫那些处于良善和真理的人能从这些邪恶的侵扰者当中得到释放，主降临世间；在世时，祂通过不断让自己遭受祂在其中不断得胜的试探而征服所有这样的灵人，后来通过祂的出现把他们投入地狱。在地狱，他们因痴迷于自己的邪恶和虚假而永远受到束缚。<br />此处“百姓”表示那些能接受良善之真理和真理之良善的人；因为“百姓或人民”一般表示那些处于信之真理和良善的人（<a href="1259.htm">1259</a>，<a href="1260.htm">1260</a>，<a href="3295.htm">3295</a>，<a href="3581.htm">3581</a>，<a href="4619.htm">4619</a>节）；在此表示以色列人，也就是那些属于属灵教会的人，或也可说，那些处于良善之真理和真理之良善的人（<a href="7957.htm">7957</a>，<a href="8234.htm">8234</a>节）。之所以说“能接受良善之真理和真理之良善”，是因为除了那些过着仁爱生活的人外，没有人拥有这种能力；这种生活赋予他们这种能力。那些以为无仁之信能赋予这种品质的人大错特错了！因为无仁之信是刚硬、抗拒的，弃绝从主所流入的一切；而仁和信一起是顺从、柔软的，接受从主所流入的东西。正因如此，赋予这种能力的是仁，而非无仁之信。仁因赋予这种能力，故也是那带来救恩的；因为那些得救的人不是靠始于他们自己的仁，而是靠来自主的仁，因而靠接受仁的能力而得救的。</p>

Until Thy people shall pass over. That this signifies that thus without danger of infestation all shall be saved who are capable of receiving the truth of good and the good of truth, is evident from 
the signification of "passing over," as being to be saved without danger of infestation; for when they who are in falsities from evil, and have infested, are cast into hell, and are removed, then there 
are none who obstruct by injecting falsities and evils, and who thus prevent the reception of good and truth from the Lord. This is what is here signified by "passing over." For so long as the evil 
were not cast into hell, scarcely any could "pass over," that is, be saved; for the evil then continually excited evils and falsities with those who were coming into the other life, and thus withheld 
them from good and truth. In order therefore that those who were in good and truth might be liberated from such infesters, the Lord came into the world; and when He was in the world, then by means of 
continual temptations admitted into Himself, and by means of continual victories therein, He subjugated all such spirits, and afterward by His presence caused them to be cast into hell, where being taken 
possession of by their own evils and falsities, they might be kept bound to eternity. [2] By "people" are here meant those who are in the capacity of receiving the truth of good and the good of truth, 
for "people" in general signifies those who are in the truth and good of faith (n. 1259, 1260, 3295, 3581, 4619); here, it signifies Israel, that is, those who are of the spiritual church, or what 
is the same, who are in the truth of good and the good of truth (n. 7957, 8234). It is said "in the capacity of receiving the truth of good and the good of truth," because no others are in this capacity 
than those who have lived a life of charity. This life gives this capacity. Hugely do those err who believe that faith without charity can confer this quality; for faith without charity is hard 
and resistant, and rejects all the influx from the Lord; but charity with faith is yielding and gentle and receives the influx. From this it is that charity gives this capacity, but not faith without 
charity; and as charity gives this capacity, it is this also which saves; for they who are saved are not saved through charity from themselves, but through charity from the Lord, consequently through 
the capacity of receiving it. </p>

<p align="center"><b>Elliott(1983-1999) 8321</b></p><p><b>8321.</b>
'Till Your people pass over' means that therefore without risk of molestation all capable of receiving the truth of good and the good of truth will be saved. This is clear from the meaning of 'passing 
over' as being saved without risk of molestation, for when those steeped in falsities arising from evil who have engaged in molestation have been cast into hell and moved away there are no longer any 
left to stand in the way by introducing falsities and evils and in so doing to prevent the reception of good and truth from the Lord. These are the things meant here by 'passing over'; for as long as 
the evil had not been cast into hell scarcely anyone was able to pass over, that is, be saved. At that time the evil were constantly rousing evils and falsities among those entering the next life, and 
thereby drawing them away from goodness and truth. To the end therefore that people governed by goodness and truth might be delivered from those evil ones the Lord came into the world. While in the 
world He subdued all such as themselves by allowing Himself repeatedly to suffer temptations in which He was repeatedly victorious and after which by His presence He caused them to be cast into hell. 
There, obsessed with their evils and falsities, they were held in bonds for evermore. </p>

<p><b>[2]</b>
 At this point 'people' is used to mean those who are capable of receiving the truth of good and the good of 
truth; for generally 'people' means those who are guided and governed by the truth and good of faith, <a href="1259.htm">1259</a>, <a href="1260.htm">1260</a>, <a href="3295.htm">3295</a>, <a href="3581.htm">3581</a>, <a href="4619.htm">4619</a>. At this point it means Israel, that is, those who belong to the spiritual 
Church, or what amounts to the same thing, those who are guided by the truth of good and governed by the good of truth <a href="7957.htm">7957</a>, <a href="8234.htm">8234</a>. The words 'capable of receiving the truth of good and the good 
of truth' are used because none have that ability except those who have led a charitable life; this life affords them that ability. How very greatly mistaken they are who believe that faith without 
charity can impart this quality! For faith without charity is hard and resistant, and repels all that flows in from the Lord, whereas charity together with faith is yielding and soft, and is receptive 
of what flows in from Him. So it is that charity imparts that ability, but not faith without charity. And since charity imparts that ability it is also what brings salvation, for those who are saved 
are not saved by charity beginning in themselves but by charity coming from the Lord, consequently by the ability to receive it. </p>

`Usque dum transibit populus Tuus': quod significet quod sic absque discrimine infestationis salvabuntur omnes qui in facultate recipiendi verum boni et bonum veri, constat ex significatione `transire' 
quod sit absque discrimine infestationis salvari, nam cum {1}injecti inferno et remoti sunt illi qui in falsis a malo qui {2}infestaverunt, tunc non {3} sunt qui obstant injiciendo falsa (c)et mala, 
et sic {4}inhibent a receptione boni et veri (c)a Domino; haec sunt quae hic per `transire' significantur; nam quamdiu mali non conjecti fuerunt in infernum, vix aliqui potuerunt transire, hoc est, 
salvari, nam tunc mali continue excitabant mala et falsa apud illos qui in alteram vitam veniebant, et sic retrahebant a bono et vero; ut itaque illi qui in bono et vero a talibus liberarentur, Dominus 
in mundum venit, et cum in mundo fuit, tunc per continuas tentationes in Se admissas, et per continuas in illis victorias, subjugavit omnes tales, et dein per praesentiam Suam fecit ut conjicerentur 
in infernum ubi obsessi a suis malis et falsis in aeternum vincti {5}tenerentur. 	2 Per `populum' hic intelliguntur qui in facultate recipiendi verum boni et bonum veri sunt, nam populus {6}in genere 
significat illos qui in vero et bono fidei {7}, n. 1259, 1260, 3295, 3581, 4619, hic significat Israelem, hoc est, illos qui ab Ecclesia spirituali, seu quod idem, qui in vero boni et in bono veri, 
n. (x)7957, 8234.  In facultate recipiendi verum boni et bonum veri dicitur quia non alii in facultate illa sunt quam qui vitam charitatis vixerunt; haec vita dat facultatem illam; (x)quam maxime errant 
qui credunt quod fides absque {8}charitate hoc quale possit dare; nam fides absque charitate est dura et resistens, (c)et rejicit omnem influxum a Domino, sed charitas cum fide {9}est cedens et mollis, 
et recipit influxum; inde est quod charitas det illam facultatem, non autem fides absque charitate; et quia charitas dat illam facultatem, etiam illa est quae salvat, nam qui salvantur non salvantur 
per {10}charitatem a se sed per {10}charitatem a Domino, consequenter per facultatem recipiendi {11}illam. 	@1 remoti sunt ac immersi inferno$ 	@2 infestaverant$ 	@3 i amplius$ 	@4 inhibendo$ 	@5
