<h3 align="center" class="ired">属天的奥秘 第10374节</h3>
<h4 align="center"></h4><p><strong>10374</strong>.“第七日便安息，恢复呼吸”表当教会已经建立时，或当一个人已经重生时，一种良善的状态。这从“第七日”的含义清楚可知，“第七日”是指当教会处于良善时，因而当它已经建立时，或当一个教会成员处于良善时，因而当他已经重生时，构成教会的一种神圣状态。就至高意义而言，“第七日”和耶和华“安息，恢复呼吸”表示在被称为“父”的神性本身和被称为“子”的神性人身的主里面的合一；因此，它们表示当主就其神性人身而言，也变成神性之爱的神性良善，也就是耶和华的时候。这解释了为何在圣言中，“七”表示神圣之物（参看<a href="395.htm">395</a>，<a href="433.htm">433</a>，<a href="716.htm">716</a>，<a href="881.htm">881</a>，<a href="5265.htm">5265</a>，<a href="5268.htm">5268</a>节）。经上之所以说耶和华在这日便安息，恢复呼吸，是因为主的人身现在已经胜过了来自地狱的一切侵扰，现在天地也在祂的掌控之下（马太福音<a href="http://39-27.cn/太28.18.htm">28:18</a>）。现在天堂也安息，恢复呼吸，因为现在主已将天堂里的一切都恢复秩序，并征服地狱。在地上也是这样，因为一旦天堂处于秩序的状态，地狱被征服，世人就能得救。由此明显可知，“耶和华的安息”在于天上的天使和地上的世人的平安和救赎或安全。当他们处于良善，并由此住在主里面时，就会拥有这些。</p>

And on the seventh day He rested, and took breath. That this signifies a state of good when the church is being set up, or when man is being regenerated, is evident from the signification of "the seventh 
day," as being a holy state, which is that of the church when it is in good, thus when it is set up, that is, when the man of the church is in good, thus when he is regenerated. In the supreme sense 
by "the seventh day," and by the "rest" and "taking breath" of Jehovah, is signified the union in the Lord of the Divine Itself which is called "the Father" and of the Divine Human which is "the Son;" 
thus when the Lord even as to His Human has become the Divine good of the Divine love, or Jehovah. From this it is that "seven" in the Word denotes what is holy (see n. 395, 433, 716, 881, 5265, 
5268). The reason why Jehovah is said then to have rested and taken breath, is that the Lord as to His Human was then above all infestations from the hells, and at the same time heaven and earth were 
under His rule (Matt. 28:18). There was at the same time also rest and taking breath in heaven, because all things in heaven had then been reduced by the Lord into order, and the hells had been subjugated. 
It was similar on earth, because when heaven was in order and the hells had been subjugated, man could be saved. From this it is plain that the "rest of Jehovah" denotes peace and salvation for 
the angels in the heavens, and for men on earth when these are in good and thereby in the Lord. </p>

'And on the seventh day He rested and recovered His breath' means the state of good when the Church has been established, or when a person has been regenerated. This is clear from the meaning of 'the 
seventh day' as the holy state which constitutes the Church when it is governed by good, thus when it has been established, or when a member of the Church is governed by good, thus when he has been regenerated. 
In the highest sense 'the seventh day' and Jehovah's 'resting and recovering His breath' mean the union within the Lord of the Divine itself, called the Father, and the Divine Human, called 
the Son; and so they mean the time when the Lord, as to His Divine Human as well, had become the Divine Good of Divine Love, that is, Jehovah. This explains why 'seven' in the Word means that which 
is holy, see <a href="395.htm">395</a>, <a href="433.htm">433</a>, <a href="716.htm">716</a>, <a href="881.htm">881</a>, <a href="5265.htm">5265</a>, <a href="5268.htm">5268</a>. The reason why it says that on that day Jehovah rested and recovered His breath is that the Lord's Human was now above all molestations from hell, and heaven 
and earth were now subject to His control, <a href="http://bible.gospelcom.net/cgi-bin/bible?passage=Matt%2028:18&amp;version=ESV&amp;interface=print&amp;showfn=yes&amp;showxref">Matt 28:18</a>. Heaven too now had rest and recovered its breath, because the Lord had now restored all things in heaven to order and had subdued the hells. 
The like was so on earth, for once heaven existed in a state of order and the hells had been subdued people could be saved. From this it is evident that Jehovah's rest consists in peace and safety for 
angels in heaven and people on earth. These they have when they are governed by good, and through this abide in the Lord.  </p>

`Et in die septimo quievit et respiravit': quod significet statum boni cum Ecclesia instaurata est, aut cum homo regeneratus, constat ex significatione `diei septimi' quod sit status sanctus, qui est 
Ecclesia cum in bono est, ita cum est instaurata; seu cum homo Ecclesiae in bono est, ita cum regeneratus; in supremo sensu per `diem septimum' et per `quietem et respirationem Jehovae tunc' significatur 
unio ipsius Divini quod Pater vocatur ac Divini Humani quod Filius in Domino, ita cum Dominus etiam quoad Humanum Suum factus est Divinum Bonum Divini Amoris seu Jehovah; inde est quod septem in 
Verbo sint sanctum, videatur n. 395, 433, 716, 881, 5265, 5268; quod Jehovah dicatur tunc quievisse et respiravisse, est quia Dominus quoad Humanum Suum tunc supra omnes infestationes ab infernis erat, 
ac tunc sub Ipsius dominio caelum et terra, Matth. xxviii 18; quies et respiratio etiam caeli erat tunc, quia a Domino tunc omnia in caelo in ordinem redacta sunt, ac inferna subjugata; similiter in 
terris, quoniam cum caelum in ordine est, et inferna subjugata, homo salvari potuit; inde patet quod quies Jehovae sit pax et salus angelis in caelis et hominibus in terris; his cum in bono sunt, et 
per id in Domino. </p>
