The Internal Sense.      Verses 1-4. And there went a man from the house of Levi, and took a daughter of Levi. And the woman conceived, and bare a son; and she saw him, that he was good, and she hid 
him three months. And she could no longer hide him; and she took for him an ark of rush, and daubed it with bitumen and with pitch; and she put the child therein, and she laid him in the sedge at the 
bank of the river. And his sister stood afar off, to know what would be done to him. "And there went a man from the house of Levi," signifies the origin of truth from good; "and took a daughter of Levi," 
signifies conjunction with good; "and the woman conceived," signifies the first of the rising; "and bare a son," signifies the law Divine in its origin; "and she saw him, that he was good," signifies 
a noticing that it was through heaven; "and she hid him three months," signifies the fullness of time in which it did not appear; "and she could no longer hide him," signifies the time when it ought 
to appear; "and she took for him an ark of rush," signifies what is of low value round about, but nevertheless derived from truth; "and daubed it with bitumen and with pitch," signifies good mixed 
with evils and falsities; "and she put the child therein," signifies that inmostly therein was the law Divine in its origin; "and she laid him in the sedge at the bank of the river," signifies that at 
first it was among false memory-knowledges; "and his sister stood afar off, to know what would be done to him," signifies the truth of the church far away from it, and advertence. </p>

THE INTERNAL SENSE </p>
<p>Verses 1-4 And a man from the house of Levi went and married a daughter of Levi. And the woman conceived and bore a son; and she saw that he was good,<A name="fntext1"></a><A href="#fn1"><sup>a</sup></a> and hid him three months. 
And she could not hide him any longer; and she took for him a box made of rush, and coated it with bitumen and pitch, and put the child in it, and put [him] in the weed at the bank of the river. And 
his sister stood at a distance, to know what would happen to him. </p>
<p>'A man from the house of Levi went' means truth which has its origin in good. 'And married a daughter of Levi' means its being joined 
to good. 'And the woman conceived' means the very beginnings. 'And bore a son means the law of God at its earliest stages. 'She saw that he was good' means the discernment that it came by way of heaven. 
'And hid him three months' means a complete period of time in which it was not seen. 'And she could not hide him any longer' means the time when it had to be seen. 'And she took for him a box made 
of rush' means a container which, though crude, was nevertheless derived from truth. 'And coated it with bitumen and pitch' means good mingled with evils and falsities. 'And put the child in it' means 
that inmostly present in it was the law of God at its earliest stages. 'And put him in the weed at the bank of the river' means that at first it was among false factual knowledge. 'And his sister 
stood at a distance, to know what would happen to him' means the Church's truth far away from there, and observation.

<p>Vers. 1-4.  Et ivit vir e domo Levi, et duxit filiam Levi.  Et concepit mulier, et peperit filium, et vidit illum quod bonus ille, et abscondit illum tribus mensibus.  Et non potuit 
amplius abscondere illum, et accepit sibi capsam junci, et bituminavit illam bitumine et pice, et posuit in illa natum, et posuit in alga ad ripam fluminis.  Et stabat soror ejus e longinquo ad cognoscendum
