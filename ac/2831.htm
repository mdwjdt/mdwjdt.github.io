<h3 align="center" class="ired">属天的奥秘 第2831节</h3>
<h4 align="center"></h4><p><strong>2831.</strong>“在后面，缠在灌木丛中”表被属世的知识缠住了。这从“缠”和“灌木丛”或“密丛”的含义清楚可知：“缠”在此是指被缠住；“灌木丛”或“密丛”是指事实知识或记忆知识，如下文所解释的。属灵之人被关乎信之真理的属世知识缠住的原因如下：属灵之人不象属天之人那样拥有对良善与真理的直觉，取代直觉的是通过信之良善与真理所形成的良知，而这些信的良善与真理都是他们打小从父母和老师，后来又从他们生在其中的信之教义所吸收来的。那些对良善与真理没有直觉的人不得不通过知识或事实来确认，对于所学到的东西，以及信之良善与真理，人人都会为自己形成某种概念。因为若没有一个概念，就没有什么东西存留在记忆中，记忆便成了一个空虚的器皿。有助于确认的细节（它们源于其它认知，甚至源于事实知识）被添加其中，并充满对这个事物的概念。被许多细节所确认的概念本身不仅使自身固定在记忆中，还使得信被注入其中。<br />至于一般的直觉，由于很少有人知道何为直觉，故必须在此予以说明。既有对属天和属灵之物中良善与真理的直觉，也有对公众生活中公义与公平的直觉，还有对私人生活中体面的直觉。关于对属天和属灵之物中良善与真理的直觉：更为内在的天使通过主拥有这种直觉，上古教会成员，以及拥有对主之爱的属天之人也有这种直觉。这些人通过某种内在意识立刻知道事情是否良善，是否真实。这种内在意识是主注入到他们里面去的，因为他们通过爱与主结合。但属灵之人没有对属天和属灵之物中良善与真理的直觉，取代直觉的是行指示的良知。不过，如前所述，这良知是通过对他们从父母和老师，以及后来他们自己对教义和圣言的研究所吸收的良善与真理的认知形成的。他们将自己的信仰置于这些认知中，即使这些认知并不完全是良善与真理。正因如此，人们能通过各种教义拥有良知，甚至外邦人也能通过自己的宗教信仰形成某种像是良知的东西。<br />属灵之人没有对信之良善与真理的直觉，却声称并相信他们所学习并领悟到的东西是真的。这从以下事实很清楚地看出来：人人都声称自己的信条是真理，异端分子比其他人更甚；他们看不到真理本身，更不会承认它，哪怕有成千上万个事物都宣称它。让每个人检查一下自己，看看他能否通过任何其它源头发觉事情是否真实，当有最真实的事向他显现时，他是不是仍不承认它。例如，有人视信而非爱为得救的本质。哪怕把主所说有关爱与仁的所有话（参看<a href="2373.htm">2373</a>节）都读给他听，哪怕他从圣言知道一切律法和先知书皆系于对主之爱和对邻之仁，他仍坚持信的观念，并声称唯信得救。而那些拥有属天和属灵直觉的人则截然不同。<br />至于对公众生活中公义与公平的直觉，那些在世时很理性的人便拥有这种直觉，还拥有对私人生活中体面的直觉。这两种直觉将人与人区分开来，但这绝不意味着这种人拥有对信之良善与真理的直觉，因为这种直觉层次更高，或更为内在，是从主经由理性的至内层流进来的。<br />属灵之人没有对信之良善与真理的直觉的另外一个原因是：良善与真理并没有像在属天之人身上那样被植入在他们的意愿部分，而是被植入在了他们的理解力部分（参看<a href="863.htm">863</a>，<a href="875.htm">875</a>，<a href="927.htm">927</a>，<a href="1023.htm">1023</a>，<a href="1043.htm">1043</a>，<a href="1044.htm">1044</a>，<a href="2256.htm">2256</a>节）。因此，属灵之人无法抵达属天之人所在之光的第一个区域（<a href="2718.htm">2718</a>节）；相对于属天之人来说，他们处于模糊的状态（<a href="1043.htm">1043</a>，<a href="2708.htm">2708</a>开头，<a href="2715.htm">2715</a>节）。由此可以推知，属灵之人被关乎信之真理的属世知识缠住了。<br />就内义而言，“灌木丛”或“密丛”表属世的记忆知识，就是诸如固定在外部记忆中的那类事实知识。这也可从圣言中的其它经文看出来，以西结书：<br />看哪，亚述曾是黎巴嫩的香柏树，枝叶荣美，影密如林，极其高大，他的枝条就在缠连的树枝间。（以西结书<a href="http://39-27.cn/结31.3.htm">31:3</a>）<br />这论述的是埃及，也就是记忆知识（<a href="1164.htm">1164</a>，<a href="1165.htm">1165</a>，<a href="1186.htm">1186</a>，<a href="1462.htm">1462</a>节）；“亚述”表理性（<a href="119.htm">119</a>，<a href="1186.htm">1186</a>节）；在圣言中，这理性也是“香柏树”，以及“黎巴嫩”；“在缠连的树枝”表在记忆知识当中，因为人类理性就建立在其记忆知识之上。<br />同一先知书：<br />主耶和华如此说：因你高耸，他将他的枝子插在缠连的枝叶间，其心既以其高大而骄傲，外邦人，就是列族中强暴的，将他砍下丢弃。（以西结书<a href="http://39-27.cn/结31.10.htm">31:10</a>，<a href="http://39-27.cn/结31.12.htm">12</a>）<br />这论述的是埃及。“将枝子插在缠连的枝叶间”表固定在记忆知识里面，并通过它们关注属灵、属天和神性事物。同一先知书：<br />好使水旁的诸树不因高大而自尊，也不将枝条插在缠连的树枝间，并且那些得水滋润的也不得高大自立。因为他们在世人中和下坑的人都被交与死亡，到低地去了。（以西结书<a href="http://39-27.cn/结31.14.htm">31:14</a>）<br />此处论述的是那些想通过基于事实知识或记忆知识的推理进入信的童秘密之人；这些人彻底瞎了眼（参看<a href="215.htm">215</a>，<a href="232.htm">232</a>，<a href="233.htm">233</a>，<a href="1072.htm">1072</a>，<a href="1911.htm">1911</a>，<a href="2196.htm">2196</a>，<a href="2203.htm">2203</a>，<a href="2568.htm">2568</a>，<a href="2588.htm">2588</a>节）。基于记忆知识的推理就是“将枝条插在缠连的树枝间”的含义。同一先知书：<br />她种植坚固的枝干，可作掌权者的杖。这枝干高举在缠连的枝中。（以西结书<a href="http://39-27.cn/结19.11.htm">19:11</a>）<br />此处的意思也一样。<br />同一先知书：<br />以色列被杀的人，倒在他们祭坛四围的偶像中，就是各青翠树下、各缠连的橡树下。（以西结书<a href="http://39-27.cn/结6.13.htm">6:13</a>）<br />这论述的是那些信自己，从而信由记忆知识所孵化出来的事物之人为自己发明的敬拜；“缠连的橡树”表处在这种状态下的记忆知识。“橡树”表由记忆知识所产生的直觉（参看<a href="1442.htm">1442</a>，<a href="1443.htm">1443</a>，<a href="2144.htm">2144</a>节）。同样的特征还出现在以西结书的别处：<br />他们看见各高山、各缠连的树，就在那里献祭。（以西结书<a href="http://39-27.cn/结20.28.htm">20:28</a>）<br />“缠连的树”表不是由圣言，而是由人自己的事实知识或记忆知识所指示的事。敬拜在果园中举行，其意义取决于这些树的性质，这一事实可参看前文（<a href="2722.htm">2722</a>节）。<br />以赛亚书：<br />邪恶像火焚烧，烧灭荆棘和蒺藜，在森林的密丛中着起来。（以赛亚书<a href="http://39-27.cn/赛9.18.htm">9:18</a>）<br />“荆棘和蒺藜”表虚假和恶欲；“森林的密丛”表记忆知识。同一先知书：<br />万军之耶和华要用铁器砍下森林的密丛，黎巴嫩必因大能者倒下。（以赛亚书<a href="http://39-27.cn/赛10.34.htm">10:34</a>）<br />“森林的密丛”表记忆知识，“黎巴嫩”表理性概念。耶利米书：<br />应当向锡安竖立大旗，因我必使灾祸与大毁灭从北方来到。有狮子从密丛中上来，是毁坏列族的。他已在路上，出离本处，要使你的地荒凉，使你的城邑被毁，无人居住。（耶利米书<a href="http://39-27.cn/耶4.6.htm">4:6</a>-<a href="http://39-27.cn/耶4.7.htm">7</a>）<br />“从密丛中”表从记忆知识或事实知识中，从此处“上来”并进入神性奥秘之物使“地荒凉”，也就是使教会荒凉。<br />在圣言中，记忆知识之所以被称为“灌木丛”或“密丛”，是因为它们本质上就像“灌木丛”或“密丛”，尤其当我欲和物欲的欲望，以及虚假的原则对他们施加影响之时。属天和属灵之爱就是那将属于外部记忆的知识整理成序的；而我欲和物欲则是那打乱秩序，并给那里的一切事物带来混乱的。人没有意识到这些事，因为他将秩序置于败坏的秩序中，将良善置于邪恶中，将真理置于虚假中。因此，这些事就纠缠在一起，即“缠在灌木丛中”。他没有意识到这些事，还因为与理性概念所在的内部记忆的事物相比，这些知识所在的外部记忆的事物如同在“密丛或灌木丛中”，或如同在幽暗的森林中。人只要活在肉身，就不可能知道相比之下，它何等荫密、幽冥和黑暗。因为那时，他以为一切智慧和聪明都来自这一源头，也就是记忆知识。但等到了来世进入内部记忆之物，他就明白了。在适合世人的外部记忆中，再没有比聪明智慧之光更缺乏的了。至于那里相对来说黑暗、无序和缠连的一切事物，可参看前文（<a href="2469.htm">2469</a>-<a href="2494.htm">2494</a>节）。</p>

Behind, caught in a thicket. That this signifies entangled in natural knowledge, is evident from the signification of being "caught," as here being entangled; and from the signification of a "thicket" 
or "tangle" as being memory-knowledge-explained in what follows. That the spiritual are held entangled in natural knowledge in regard to the truths of faith, is as follows. The spiritual have not perception 
of good and truth, as the celestial have, but instead of it conscience formed from the goods and truths of faith which they have imbibed from infancy from their parents and masters, and afterwards 
from the doctrine of faith into which they were born. They who have no perception of good and truth have to be confirmed by knowledges. Everyone forms for himself some idea respecting the things 
he has learned, and also respecting the goods and truths of faith; for without an idea, nothing remains in the memory otherwise than as an empty thing. Confirmatory things are added thereto, and fill 
up the idea of the thing, from other knowledges, even from memory-knowledges. The confirmation of the idea itself by many things causes not only that it sticks in the memory, so that it can be called 
forth into the thought, but also that faith can be insinuated into it.  [2] As regards perception in general, since few know what perception is, this must be declared. There is perception of what is 
good and true in celestial and spiritual things; there is perception of what is just and equitable in civil life; and there is perception of what is honorable in moral life. As regards the perception 
of what is good and true in celestial and spiritual things, the interior angels have this perception from the Lord, the men of the Most Ancient Church had it, and the celestial, who are in love to the 
Lord, have it. These know at once, from a kind of internal observation, whether a thing is good and whether it is true; for this is insinuated by the Lord, because they are conjoined with Him by love. 
Spiritual men, however, have no such perception of good and truth in celestial and spiritual things, but instead of it have conscience which dictates; but as before said, this conscience is formed 
from the knowledges of good and truth which they have imbibed from their parents and masters, and afterwards from their own study in doctrine and in the Word; and in these, even though not entirely good 
and true, they put their faith. Hence it is that men can have conscience from any doctrine whatever; even the Gentiles have something not unlike conscience from their religion.  [3] That the spiritual 
have no perception of the good and truth of faith, but say and believe that to be true which they have learned and apprehended, is sufficiently evident from the fact that everyone says that his own 
dogma is true, heretics more than others; and that they are not able to see the truth itself, still less to acknowledge it, although thousands of things should declare it. Let everyone explore himself 
and see if he is able to perceive from any other source whether a thing is true; and if when a thing most true is made manifest to him he still does not acknowledge it. As for example, one 
who makes faith the essential of salvation, and not love: even if all should be read before him which the Lord spoke concerning love and charity (see n. 2373), and if he should know from the Word that 
all the Law and the Prophets hang upon love to the Lord and charity toward the neighbor, he will nevertheless remain in the idea of faith, and will say that this alone saves. It is otherwise with those 
who are in celestial and spiritual perception.  [4] As regards the perception of what is just and equitable in civil life, however, those in the world who are rational have this, and also the perception 
of what is honorable in moral life. These two perceptions distinguish one man from another, but by no means do such men for this reason have the perception of the good and truth of faith, because 
this perception is higher or more internal, and flows in from the Lord through the inmost of the rational.  [5] The reason also why the spiritual have no perception of the good and truth of faith, 
is that good and truth are not implanted in their will part, as with celestial men, but in their intellectual part (see n. 863, 875, 927, 1023, 1043, 1044, 2256). Hence it is that the spiritual cannot 
arrive at the first degree of the light in which the celestial are (n. 2718), but have what is obscure in comparison (n. 1043, 2708 at the beginning, 2715). That the spiritual are entangled in natural 
memory-knowledge in respect to the truths of faith, follows from this.  [6] That a "thicket" or "tangle" in the internal sense signifies natural memory-knowledge, that is, that knowledge which sticks 
fast in the exterior memory, may also be seen from other passages in the Word. In Ezekiel: </p>
<p>     Behold, Asshur was a cedar in Lebanon, with beautiful foliage, and a shady grove, and lofty in height, 
and his branch was among the tangled boughs (Ezek. 31:3); </p>
<p>where Egypt, which is memory-knowledge, is treated of (n. 1164, 1165, 1186, 1462); "Asshur" denotes the rational (n. 119, 1186); which is 
also the "cedar," and also "Lebanon," in the Word; "among the tangled boughs" means among memory-knowledges, for the human rational is founded on its memory-knowledges.  [7] In the same: </p>
<p>     Thus 
saith the Lord Jehovih, Because thou art exalted in stature, and he hath set his branch among the tangled boughs, and his heart is lifted up in its height, strangers, the violent of the nations, shall 
cut him down, and cast him out (Ezek. 31:10, 12); </p>
<p>     concerning Egypt; to "set the branch among the tangled boughs" denotes sticking fast in memory-knowledges, and regarding spiritual, celestial, 
and Divine things from them. In the same: </p>
<p>     To the end that none of all the trees by the waters exalt themselves in their stature, neither set their branch among the tangled boughs, nor that all 
that drink waters stand over them in their height, for they shall all be delivered unto death, to the lower earth in the midst of the sons of man, to them that go down to the pit (Ezek. 31:14); </p>
<p>here 
those are treated of who by reasonings from memory-knowledges desire to enter into the mysteries of faith (that they are made altogether blind, may be seen above, n. 215, 232, 233, 1072, 1911, 2196, 2203, 
2568, 2588). To reason from memory-knowledges is to "set the branch among the tangled boughs." In the same: </p>
<p>     She had plants of strength for the scepters of them that bare rule, and her height 
was exalted among the tangled boughs (Ezek. 19:11); </p>
<p>this has a similar meaning.  [8] In the same: </p>
<p>     The slain of Israel shall be among their idols, round about their altars, and under every green 
tree, and under every tangled oak (Ezek. 6:13); </p>
<p>this treats of the worship which those form to themselves who have faith in themselves, and thus in the things which they hatch out from their memory-knowledges; 
the "tangled oak" denotes the memory-knowledges in such a state. (That "oaks" are apperceptions from memory-knowledges may be seen above, n. 1442, 1443, 2144.) The like is found elsewhere 
in the same Prophet: </p>
<p>     They saw every high hill, and every tangled tree, and there they sacrificed their sacrifices (Ezek. 20:28); </p>
<p>a "tangled tree" denotes the things which are dictated not by 
the Word, but by one's own memory-knowledge. (That worship was performed in groves, and was significative according to the qualities of the trees, may be seen above, n. 2722.)  [9] In Isaiah: </p>
<p>     
Wickedness burneth as the fire; it devoureth the briars and thorns, and kindleth in the thickets of the forest (Isa. 9:18); </p>
<p>the "briars and thorns" denote falsity and cupidity; the "thickets of the forest," 
memory-knowledges. In the same: </p>
<p>     Jehovah Zebaoth shall cut down the thickets of the forest with iron, and Lebanon shall fall by a mighty one (Isa. 10:34); </p>
<p>the "thickets of the forest" denote 
memory-knowledges and "Lebanon," things rational. In Jeremiah: </p>
<p>     Set up a standard toward Zion, for I will bring evil from the north, and a great destruction; a lion is gone up from his thicket, 
and a destroyer of nations; he is on his way, he is gone forth from his place, to make thy land a waste; thy cities shall be destroyed, without inhabitant (Jer. 4:6-7); </p>
<p>"from his thicket" denotes 
from memory-knowledge; and that which ascends into Divine arcana from this makes the "land a waste," that is, lays waste the church.  [10] The reason why in the Word memory-knowledges are called "thickets," 
is that they are comparatively of such a character, especially when the cupidities of the love of self and of the world, and the principles of falsity, seek for them. Celestial and spiritual 
love is that which disposes into order the knowledges which are of the exterior memory; and the love of self and of the world is that which perverts the order, and disturbs all things in it. These things 
the man does not take notice of, because he places order in perverted order, good in evil, and truth in falsity. On this account these things are in entanglement; and also on this, that the things 
of the exterior memory, where these knowledges are, compared with those in the interior memory, where rational things are, are as in a thicket, or as in a dark forest. How shady, opaque, and dark it 
is there in comparison, a man cannot know so long as he is living in the body; for he then supposes that all wisdom and intelligence are from this source; but he will know in the other life, when he comes 
into the things of his interior memory. That in the exterior memory, which is proper to man while he is living in the world, nothing is less to be found than the light of intelligence and wisdom; 
but that all is relatively dark, disorderly, and entangled there, may be seen above (n. 2469-2494). </p>

<p align="center"><b>Elliott(1983-1999) 2831</b></p><p><b>2831.</b>
'Behind [him] caught in a thicket' means entangled in natural knowledge. This is clear from the meaning here of 'caught in' as being entangled in, and from the meaning of 'a thicket' or fan entanglement' 
as factual knowledge, to be dealt with in what follows. Those who are spiritual are caught and entangled in natural knowledge as regards truths of faith for the following reasons: Those who are spiritual 
do not possess the perception of good and truth as those who are celestial do. Instead of perception they have conscience, which is formed from the goods and truths of faith which from early 
childhood they have taken in from parents and teachers, and after that from the doctrine of the faith into which they were born. The only way that those who do not possess the perception of good and truth 
can receive confirmation is from facts. Everyone forms some concept for himself regarding the things he has learned, and also regarding the goods and truths of faith. Without that nothing remains 
in the memory except as an empty vessel. Details that serve to confirm - derived from other cognitions, and even from factual knowledge - are added to and fill in the concept. The concept itself confirmed 
by many details not only causes itself to be fixed in the memory, from which it may be called forth into thought, but also enables faith to be instilled into it. </p>
<p></p>
<p><b>[2]</b>
 As regards perception in 
general, since few know what perception is, this must be stated here. There is the perception of what is good and true in things that are celestial and spiritual; there is the perception of what is just 
and fair in public life; and there is the perception of what is honourable in private life. As regards the perception of what is good and true in celestial and spiritual things, this is the perception 
which the more interior angels possess from the Lord. It was also the perception which members of the Most Ancient Church possessed, and it is the perception which celestial people possess, who are 
moved by love to the Lord. These people know in an instant from a certain inner awareness whether a thing is good and whether it is true, for the Lord instills it into them because they are joined by 
love to Him. But spiritual people do not possess such perception of what is good and true in celestial and spiritual things. Instead of perception they have conscience which dictates. Conscience however, 
as has been stated, is formed from cognitions of good and truth which they have taken in from parents and teachers and later on from their own devotion to doctrine and the Word. And on these cognitions 
they pin their faith, even though these may not be goods and truths to any great extent. This being so, people can have a conscience that is derived from any variety of doctrine; even gentiles 
possess something not unlike conscience, derived from their own form of religion. </p>
<p></p>
<p><b>[3]</b>
 The fact that those who are spiritual have no perception of the good and truth of faith but say and believe to 
be true that which they have learned and grasped becomes quite clear from the consideration that everyone calls his own tenets the truth - heretics more than others - and from the consideration that 
they are unable to see, let alone acknowledge, the truth itself, even though thousands of things might declare it. Let everyone search within himself to see whether he is able to perceive from any other 
source whether a thing is true, and whether when that which is absolutely true is made plain to him he still does not acknowledge it. Take for example someone who makes faith and not love the essential 
of salvation. Even if all the things were read out to him which the Lord spoke regarding love and charity, see <a href="2373.htm">2373</a>, and even if he knew from the Word that all the Law and all the Prophets hung on 
love to the Lord and charity towards the neighbour, he would still persist in the idea of faith and would say that this alone was what saved. It is altogether different in the case of those who possess 
celestial and spiritual perception. </p>
<p></p>
<p><b>[4]</b>
 But as regards the perception of what is just and fair in public life, those in the world who are rational possess this, together with the perception of 
what is honourable in private life. So far as these two types of perception are concerned, one person differs from the next; but this in no sense implies that such persons possess the perception of the 
good and truth of faith, since this kind of perception is higher or more interior and flows in from the Lord by way of the inmost part of the rational. </p>
<p></p>
<p><b>[5]</b>
 A further reason why spiritual people do 
not possess a perception of the good and truth of faith is that good and truth are not implanted in the will part of their minds, as in the case of celestial people, but in the understanding part; see <a href="863.htm">863</a>, <a href="875.htm">875</a>, <a href="927.htm">927</a>, <a href="1023.htm">1023</a>, <a href="1043.htm">1043</a>, <a href="1044.htm">1044</a>, <a href="2256.htm">2256</a>. This is why spiritual people are not able to enter the first region of the light that celestial people dwell in, <a href="2718.htm">2718</a>, but in comparison with them are in obscurity, 
<a href="1043.htm">1043</a>, <a href="2708.htm">2708</a>, <a href="2715.htm">2715</a>. The fact that those who are spiritual are entangled in natural knowledge as regards truths of faith follows from this.  </p>
<p></p>
<p><b>[6]</b>
 As regards 'a thicket' or 'an entanglement' in the 
internal sense meaning natural knowledge, that is, factual knowledge such as becomes fixed in the exterior memory, this may also be seen from other places in the Word: in Ezekiel, </p>
<blockquote>
Behold, Asshur 
was a cedar in Lebanon, beautiful in its boughs, and a forest shade, and lofty in height, and its trunk among entangled boughs. <a href="http://bible.gospelcom.net/cgi-bin/bible?passage=Ezek%2031:%203&amp;version=ESV&amp;interface=print&amp;showfn=yes&amp;showxref">Ezek 31: 3</a>. 
</blockquote>
<p>This refers to 'Egypt', which is knowledge, <a href="1164.htm">1164</a>, <a href="1165.htm">1165</a>, 
<a href="1186.htm">1186</a>, <a href="1462.htm">1462</a>. 'Asshur' stands for the rational, <a href="119.htm">119</a>, <a href="1186.htm">1186</a>, which in the Word is also 'a cedar', and 'Lebanon' as well. 'Among entangled boughs' stands for among facts, for the human rational is based on 
the facts known to it which it commands. </p>
<p></p>
<p><b>[7]</b>
 In the same prophet, </p>
<blockquote>
Thus said the Lord Jehovih, Because you are exalted in height, and he has set his trunk up among entangled boughs, and his heart 
has become lifted up in his height, foreigners, the violent of the nations, will cut him down and cast him out. <a href="http://bible.gospelcom.net/cgi-bin/bible?passage=Ezek%2031:%2010,%2012&amp;version=ESV&amp;interface=print&amp;showfn=yes&amp;showxref">Ezek 31: 10, 12</a>. 
</blockquote>
<p>This refers to Egypt. 'Setting his trunk among entangled boughs' 
stands for sticking to facts and looking at spiritual, celestial, and Divine things, from them as the standpoint. In the same prophet, </p>
<blockquote>
This is in order that none of all the trees by the waters may 
exalt themselves in their height, and set their trunk up among entangled boughs, and that none of all that drink water may reach above them in their height, for they will all be given over to death, 
to the lower earth in the midst of the sons of men, to those going down to the pit. <a href="http://bible.gospelcom.net/cgi-bin/bible?passage=Ezek%2031:%2014&amp;version=ESV&amp;interface=print&amp;showfn=yes&amp;showxref">Ezek 31: 14</a>. 
</blockquote>
<p>This refers to those who wish by means of reasonings based on factual knowledge to penetrate the mysteries 
of faith; these become totally blind, see <a href="215.htm">215</a>, <a href="232.htm">232</a>, <a href="233.htm">233</a>, <a href="1072.htm">1072</a>, <a href="1911.htm">1911</a>, <a href="2196.htm">2196</a>, <a href="2203.htm">2203</a>, <a href="2568.htm">2568</a>, <a href="2588.htm">2588</a>. Reasoning based on facts is the meaning of 'setting their trunk up among entangled boughs'. In the 
same prophet, </p>
<blockquote>
It had strong shoots as sceptres for those who have dominion, and its height rose up above among entangled boughs. <a href="http://bible.gospelcom.net/cgi-bin/bible?passage=Ezek%2019:%2011&amp;version=ESV&amp;interface=print&amp;showfn=yes&amp;showxref">Ezek 19: 11</a>. 
</blockquote>
<p>Here the meaning is similar.  </p>
<p></p>
<p><b>[8]</b>
 In the same prophet, </p>
<blockquote>
The 
slain of Israel in the midst of their idols, around their altars, and under every green tree, and under every entangled oak. <a href="http://bible.gospelcom.net/cgi-bin/bible?passage=Ezek%206:%2013&amp;version=ESV&amp;interface=print&amp;showfn=yes&amp;showxref">Ezek 6: 13</a>. 
</blockquote>
<p>This refers to the kind of worship which people 
invent for themselves who have faith in themselves, and so in those things which they hatch out from their factual knowledge. 'An entangled oak' stands for facts as they exist in that particular state, 
'oaks' meaning perceptions arising out of facts, see <a href="1442.htm">1442</a>, <a href="1443.htm">1443</a>, <a href="2144.htm">2144</a>. The same feature occurs elsewhere in the same prophet, </p>
<blockquote>
They looked at every high hill and every entangled tree, and there 
they offered their sacrifices. <a href="http://bible.gospelcom.net/cgi-bin/bible?passage=Ezek%2020:%2028&amp;version=ESV&amp;interface=print&amp;showfn=yes&amp;showxref">Ezek 20: 28</a>. 
</blockquote>
<p>'Entangled tree' stands for things which are not dictated by the Word but by a person's own factual knowledge. The fact that worship used to take place 
in groves and depended for its meaning on the nature of the trees, see <a href="2722.htm">2722</a>. </p>
<p></p>
<p><b>[9]</b>
 In Isaiah, </p>
<blockquote>
For wickedness will burn like a fire, it will consume brier and thorn, and will kindle the entangled 
boughs of the wood. <a href="http://bible.gospelcom.net/cgi-bin/bible?passage=Isa%209:%2018&amp;version=ESV&amp;interface=print&amp;showfn=yes&amp;showxref">Isa 9: 18</a>. 
</blockquote>
<p>'Brier and thorn' stands for falsity and evil desire, 'the entangled boughs of the wood' for facts. In the same prophet, </p>
<blockquote>
Jehovah Zebaoth will hew down the entangled 
boughs of the wood with an axe, and Lebanon will fall by a majestic one. <a href="http://bible.gospelcom.net/cgi-bin/bible?passage=Isa%2010:%2034&amp;version=ESV&amp;interface=print&amp;showfn=yes&amp;showxref">Isa 10: 34</a>. 
</blockquote>
<p>'The entangled boughs of the wood' stands for facts, 'Lebanon' for rational concepts. In Jeremiah, </p>
<blockquote>
Raise 
a standard towards Zion, for I am bringing evil from the north, and a great destruction. A lion has risen up from his thicket, and a destroyer of nations has set out and come from his place to make your 
land a waste. Your cities will be destroyed, and left without inhabitants. <a href="http://bible.gospelcom.net/cgi-bin/bible?passage=Jer%204:%206,%207&amp;version=ESV&amp;interface=print&amp;showfn=yes&amp;showxref">Jer 4: 6, 7</a>. 
</blockquote>
<p>'From his thicket' stands for from factual knowledge, and that which 'rises up' from this and enters into 
Divine arcana 'makes the land a waste', that is, lays waste the Church. </p>
<p></p>
<p><b>[10]</b>
 The reason why in the Word facts are called 'thickets' is that facts are by nature like thickets, especially when the desires 
of self-love and love of the world, and false assumptions, exert an influence on them. Celestial and spiritual love is a love which arranges into order the facts that belong to the external memory, 
whereas self-love and love of the world disrupt that order and bring confusion to everything there. These are matters of which man is not aware because he takes that to be order which in fact is 
perverted order, that to be good which in fact is evil, and that to be truth which in fact is falsity; therefore those things are 'in a thicket'. He is also unaware of these matters because the things 
that belong to the external memory where facts reside are - in comparison with those that belong to the internal memory, where rational concepts reside - in a thicket, or in some gloomy woodland. How 
shadowy, gloomy, and darkened it is there in comparison, nobody can know as long as he lives in the body, for during that time he imagines that all wisdom and intelligence arise from facts; but he will 
know it in the next life when he has entered the things that belong to the internal memory. In the external memory which is proper to man during his life in the world nothing is more lacking than the 
light of wisdom and intelligence. But that everything there is by comparison dark, disordered, and entangled, see <a href="2469.htm">2469</a>-<a href="2494.htm">2494</a>. </p>

`Post detentus in perplexo': quod significet implicatos in scientifico naturali, constat a significatione `detineri' hic quod implicari; et ex significatione `perplexi' aut implexi, quod sit scienti 
cum, de qua sequitur.  Quod spirituales detineantur {1}implicati scientifico naturali quoad vera fidei, ita se habet: spirituales non habent perceptionem boni et veri sicut caelestes, sed loco ejus conscientia 
quae formata est a bonis et veris fidei quae ab infantia a parenti: et magistris, et dein a doctrina fidei in quam nati sunt, hauserunt; qui non perceptionem boni et veri habent, ii non possunt 
aliter quam confirmari a scientificis, quisque aliquam ideam sibi facit de illis quae didicit, etiam de bonis et veris fidei; absque idea non manet quicquam in memoria aliter quam ut res vacua; confirmantia 
accedunt et implent ideam rei, ex cognitionibus aliis, etiam a scientificis; ipsa idea confirmata a pluribus facit ut non modo haereat in memoria, et evocari inde possit in cogitationem, sed 
etiam ut fides ei insinuari possit. [2] Quod perceptionem in genere attinet, quia pauci norunt quid perceptio, dicendum; est perceptio boni et veri in caelestibus spiritualibus, est perceptio justi 
et aequi in vita civili, et est perceptio honesti in vita morali; quod perceptionem boni et veri in caelestibus et spiritualibus concernit, hanc habent angeli interiores a Domino et hanc habuerunt homines 
Ecclesiae Antiquissimae, et hanc habent caelestes qui in amore in Dominum sunt; sciunt ilico ex interna quadam animadvertentia num bonum sit et num verum, Dominus enim insinuat hoc quia Domino sunt 
amore conjuncti; at spirituales homines non habent talem perceptionem boni et veri in rebus caelestibus spiritualibus, sed loco ejus habent conscientiam quae dictat; conscientia formata est ex cognitionibus 
boni et veri quas hauserunt a parentibus et magistris, ut dictum, et dein ex proprio studio doctrina et in Verbo; illis fidem adjungunt tametsi non {2}forent bona et vera; inde est quod conscientiam 
habere possint homines ex quacumque doctrina, etiam conscientiae non {3}absimile gentiles ex suo religioso; [3] quod spirituales non habeant perceptionem boni et veri fidei, sed dicant et credant 
verum esse quod didicerunt et captarunt, constare satis potest ex eo quod unusquisque dicat suum dogma esse verum, magis haeretici quam alii, et quod ipsum verum non videre, minus agnoscere possint, 
tametsi millia dictarent; exploret quisque se, an percipere aliunde possit num verum, et annon cum verissimum ei manifestatur, usque non agnoscat; ut pro exemplo, qui fidem essentialem salutis facit, 
non amorem, tametsi coram {4}illo omnia illa legerentur quae Dominus de amore et charitate locutus, videantur n. 2371, et sciat ex Verbo quod omnis Lex et omnes Prophetae ab amore in Dominum et charitate 
erga proximum, pendeant, usque tamen manebit in idea fidei, et dicet illam solam salvare; aliter illi qui in perceptione caelesti et spirituali sunt. [4] Quod autem perceptionem justi et aequi 
in vita civili attinet, hanc habent illi in mundo {5} qui rationales sunt, et quoque perceptionem honesti in vita morali; quoad illam et hanc distinguit se unus homo ab altero; sed iidem {6}nusquam ideo 
habent perceptionem boni et veri fidei, quia haec perceptio est superior seu interior et influit per intimum rationalis a Domino. [5] Causa quoque cur spirituales non habent perceptionem boni et veri 
fidei; est quia bonum et verum non implantatum est in parte eorum voluntaria ut apud homines caelestes, sed in parte intellectuali, videatur n. 863, 875, 927, 1023, 1043, 1044, 2256; inde est quod 
spirituales non possint ad primum lucis in qua sunt caelestes, venire, n. 2718, sed quod illis obscurum sit respective, n. 1043, 2708 pr, 2715; quod spirituales implicati sint scientifico naturali quoad 
vera fidei, inde sequitur. [6] Quod `perplexum' seu `implexum' in sensu interno significet scientificum naturale, hoc est, illud scientificum quod in memoria exteriore haeret, constare etiam potest 
ab aliis locis in Verbo; apud Ezechielem,           Ecce Asshur cedrus in Libano, pulchra fronde, et nemus      umbrosum, et excelsa altitudine, et inter implexa fuit ramus      ejus, xxxi 3; </p>
<p>ubi 
de `Aegypto,' quae est scientia, n. 1164, 1165, 1186, 1462; `Asshur' pro rationali, n. 119, 1186, quod etiam est `cedrus,' tum `Libanus,' in Verbo; `inter implexa' pro inter scientifica, rationale enim 
humanum fundatur in scientificis ejus: [7] apud eundem,            Sic dixit Dominus Jehovih, Quoniam elatus es      altitudine, et dedit ramum suum ad inter implexa, et elatum      factum est 
cor ejus in elatione sua, exscindent eum alieni,      violenti gentium, et dejicient eum, xxxi 10, 12; </p>
<p>de Aegypto, `dare ramum inter implexa' pro haerere in scientificis, et inde spectare spiritualia, 
caelestia, et Divina: apud eundem,           Propterea ut non extollant se in altitudine sua omnes       arbores aquarum, et non dent ramum suum ad inter implexa, et      non stent super illis in 
altitudine sua omnes bibentes aquas,      quia omnes illi dabuntur morti, ad terram inferiorem in medio      filiorum hominis ad descendentes foveam, xxxi 14; </p>
<p>ubi de illis qui per ratiocinia ex scientificis, 
intrare volunt in mysteria fidei, qui quod prorsus occaecentur, videatur n. 215, 232, 233, 1072, 1911, 2196, 2203, 2568, 2588; ratiocinari ex scientificis, est `dare ramum ad inter implexa': 
apud eundem,           Fuerunt illi plantae roboris ad sceptra dominantium, et      extulit se altitudo ejus super inter implexa, xix 11; </p>
<p>similiter: [8] apud eundem,           Confossi Israelis 
in medio idolorum eorum, circum       altaria eorum,...et sub omni arbore viridi, et sub omni quercu      implexa, vi 13; </p>
<p>agitur de cultu quem sibi fingunt, fidem habentes sibi, ita illis quae ex 
scientificis suis excludunt; `quercus implexa' pro scientificis in tali statu; quod `quercus' sint apperceptiones ex scientificis, videatur n. 1442, 1443, 2144; similiter alibi apud eundem,         
  Viderunt omnem collem altum, et omnem arborem implexam,      et sacrificabant ibi sacrificia sua, xx 28; </p>
<p>{7}`arbor implexa' pro illis quae non dictat Verbum, sed scientificum proprium; quod cultus 
fieret in lucis, et significativus esset secundum arborum qualitates, videatur n. 2722: [9] apud Esaiam,           Ardet sicut ignis malitia, senticetum et vepretum       comedet, et incendet implexa 
silvae, ix 17 [A.V. 18]; </p>
<p>`senticetum et vepretum' pro falsitate et cupiditate, `implexa silvae' pro scientificis: apud eundem,           Jehovah Zebaoth excidet implexa silvae ferro, et      Libanus 
per magnificum cadet, x 34; </p>
<p>`implexa silvae' pro scientificis, `Libanus' pro rationalibus: apud Jeremiam,           Tollite signum versus Zionem,...quia malum Ego adducens      e septentrione, 
et confractionem magnam; ascendit leo ex      perplexo suo, et perditor gentium profectus exivit e loco suo,      ad ponendum terram tuam in vastitatem, urbes tuae destruentur,      ut nullus habitator, 
iv 6, 7; </p>
<p>ex perplexo' pro ex scientifico, ex quo quod `ascendit' in arcana Divina, `ponit terram in vastitatem,' hoc est, Ecclesiam vastat. [10] Quod scientifica in Verbo dicantur `perplexa,' 
est causa quia respective talia sunt, imprimis cum cupiditates amoris sui et mundi et principia falsi {8}adspirant; amor caelestis et spiritualis est qui scientifica quae sunt memoriae exterioris, disponit 
in ordinem, at amor sui et mundi pervertit ordinem, et perturbat omnia quae ibi; haec non animadvertit homo, quia in perverso ordine ponit ordinem, in malo bonum, et in falso verum, inde sunt illa 
in perplexo; etiam ex eo quod illa quae sunt memoriae exterioris ubi scientifica, ad illa quae in memoria interiore, ubi sunt rationalia, sint respective in perplexo, aut sicut in opaca silva; quam 
umbrosum, opacum et tenebricosum sit ibi respective, non scire potest homo, quamdiu in corpore vivit; putat enim tunc quod omnis sapientia et intelligentia sit inde, sed sciet in altera vita, quando 
in illa quae sunt memoriae interioris, venit, quod in memoria exteriore, quae propria est homini cum vivit in mundo, nihil minus sit quam lux sapientiae et intelligentiae, sed quod respective ibi tenebrosum,
