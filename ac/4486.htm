<h3 align="center" class="ired">属天的奥秘 第4486节</h3>
<h4 align="center"></h4><p><strong>4486.</strong>“就是我们中间所有的男丁都要受割礼，和他们受割礼一样”表只要他们通过这种方式唯独在外在方面被引入他们的代表和有意义的符号。这从“受割礼”的含义清楚可知，“受割礼”是指外在代表，就是他们属于教会，此处属于存在于雅各后代当中的宗教表象的一个标志（参看<a href="4462.htm">4462</a>节）。由于这些人接受他们唯独在于外在的宗教表象（<a href="4281.htm">4281</a>，<a href="4293.htm">4293</a>，<a href="4307.htm">4307</a>节），故经上说“和他们受割礼一样”。由此明显可知，上述这些话表示只要他们通过这种方式唯独在外在方面被引入犹太人的代表和有意义的符号。从下文可清楚看出这些话里面所包含的详细内容。</p>

<p align="center"><b>Potts(1905-1910) 4486</b></p><p><b>4486.</b>
In every male being circumcised to us even as they are circumcised. That this signifies provided they would be initiated thereby into their representatives and significatives in respect to externals 
alone, is evident from the signification of "to be circumcised," as being an external representative, a sign that they were of the church, here of the religiosity in which were the descendants of Jacob 
(see n. 4462). And because these men accepted their religiosity, which consisted in externals alone (n. 4281, 4293, 4307), it is therefore said, "even as they are circumcised." Hence it is evident that 
the words above quoted signify initiation by the means in question into the Jewish representatives and significatives in respect to externals alone. What these words further enfold within them will 
appear from what follows. </p>

'That every male be circumcised, as they are circumcised' means provided they were introduced by this means into their representatives and meaningful signs, solely into the external observances involved 
in these. This is clear from the meaning of 'being circumcised' as an external representative - as the sign that they were members of the Church, in this case of the semblance of religion which existed 
with those descended from Jacob, dealt with in <a href="4462.htm">4462</a>. And because they accepted their kind of religion which consisted solely in external observances, <a href="4281.htm">4281</a>, <a href="4293.htm">4293</a>, <a href="4307.htm">4307</a>, it is therefore said 'as they 
are circumcised'. From this it is evident 'that every male be circumcised, as they are circumcised' means provided they were introduced by this means into their representatives and meaningful signs, 
solely into the external observances involved in these. What more is embodied in those words will be clear from what follows below. </p>

</p><b>4486.</b>
`In circumcidi omnem masculum quemadmodum illi circumcisi': </p>
<p>quod significet si initiarentur per illa in repraesentativa et significativa illorum quoad sola externa, constat ex significatione `circumcidi' 
quod sit repraesentativum externum, signum quod essent ab Ecclesia, hic a religioso in quo fuerunt posteri ex Jacobo, de qua n. 4462; et quia acceptabant eorum religiosum, quod in solis externis 
constabat, n. 4281, 4293, 4307, ideo dicitur, `quemadmodum illi circumcisi {1}'; inde patet quod per `circumcidi omnem masculum quemadmodum illi circumcisi' significetur si initiarentur per 
illud in repraesentativa et significativa illorum quoad sola externa: quid haec praeterea involvunt, constabit ea sequentibus.      @1 i sunt$ </p>
