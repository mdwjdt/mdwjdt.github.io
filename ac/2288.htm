<h3 align="center" class="ired">属天的奥秘 第2288节</h3>
<h4 align="center"></h4><p><strong>2288.</strong>“亚伯拉罕也回到自己的地方去了”表主回到祂发觉这些事之前所在的状态。这从本章“亚伯拉罕”的代表和“地方”的含义清楚可知，“亚伯拉罕”是指处于人性状态的主；“地方”是指状态，如第一卷所示（<a href="1273.htm">1273</a>，<a href="1378.htm">1378</a>节）。因此，就内义而言，“回到自己的地方”在此表回到祂之前的状态。前面已阐述并说明，主在世时具有两种状态，即谦卑的状态和荣耀的状态。其谦卑的状态出现在祂处于人性之时，这人性是祂通过遗传从母亲那里得来的；而其荣耀的状态出现在祂处于神性之时，这神性是祂从耶和华祂的父那里所拥有的。当主离世，回到祂自永恒所在的神性本身 （约翰福音<a href="http://39-27.cn/约17.5.htm">17:5</a>）时，祂完全脱去前一种状态，即源于母亲的人性状态，并披上神性人，连同已变成神性的人性，充满整个天堂的神圣活动就通过这二者存在。因此，主通过这神性本身和神性人，并经由这二者所发出的神圣活动掌管整个宇宙。</p>

Abraham returned to his place. That this signifies that the Lord returned into the state in which He had been before He perceived these things, is evident from the representation of Abraham in this chapter, 
as being the Lord in the human state; and from the signification of a "place," as being a state (as shown above, volume 1, n. 1273, 1378); thus to "return to his place," in the internal sense, 
here signifies to return to the state in which He had been before. That while He lived in this world the Lord had two states, namely, a state of humiliation and a state of glorification, has been said 
and shown before. His state of humiliation was when He was in the human which He took by inheritance from the mother; His state of glorification was when He was in the Divine which He had from Jehovah 
His Father. The former state, namely, that of the human from the mother, the Lord altogether put off, and put on the Divine Human, when He passed out of the world, and returned to the Divine Itself, 
in which He was from eternity (John 17:5), together with the Human made Divine; from both of which comes the Holy which fills the universal heaven. Thus from the Divine Itself and the Divine Human, 
by means of the proceeding Holy, He directs the universe. </p>

That 'Abraham returned to his place' means that the Lord returned to the state which had been His before He perceived these matters is clear from the representation of 'Abraham' in this chapter as the 
Lord when the human state existed with Him, and from the meaning of 'place' as state, dealt with in Volume One, in <a href="1273.htm">1273</a>, <a href="1378.htm">1378</a>. Thus here 'returning to his place' in the internal sense means returning 
to the state which had been His previously. The fact that the Lord had two kinds of states when He lived in the world - the state of humiliation and the state of glorification - has been stated and 
shown already. His state of humiliation occurred when He was in the human, which He had derived by heredity from the mother, His state of glorification when He was in the Divine, which He possessed from 
Jehovah His Father. The former state, namely that of the human derived from the mother, the Lord cast off completely and He took on a Divine Human when He passed out of the world and returned to the 
Divine itself which had been His from eternity, <a href="http://bible.gospelcom.net/cgi-bin/bible?passage=John%2017:%205&amp;version=ESV&amp;interface=print&amp;showfn=yes&amp;showxref">John 17: 5</a>, together with the Human that had been made Divine, from both of which the Holy proceeding exists that fills the whole heaven. Thus from the 
Divine itself and the Divine Human through the Holy that proceeds from these He governs the universe. </p>

Quod `Abraham reversus ad locum suum' significet quod Dominus in statum in quo fuit antequam haec percepit, rediret, constat ex repraesentatione `Abrahami' in hoc capite quod sit Dominus in statu humano, 
et ex significatione `loci' quod sit status, de qua in Parte Prima n. 1273, 1378; ita hic `reverti ad locum suum' in sensu interno est redire ad statum in quo prius fuit.  Quod bini `status fuerint' 
Domino cum vixit in mundo, nempe status humiliationis et status glorificationis, prius dictum et ostensum est; status humiliationis Ipsius fuit cum in humano, quod traxit hereditario a {1} matre; 
status glorificationis cum in Divino, quod habuit a Jehovah Patre Ipsius; illum statum, nempe humanum `a matre, prorsus exuit Dominus, et induit Humanum Divinum cum transivit e mundo, et rediit ad Ipsum 
Divinum in quo fuit ab aeterno, Joh. xvii 5, una cum Humano Divino facto, ex quo utroque est Sanctum {2} quod universum caelum implet: ita ex Divino Ipso, Humano Divino {3} per Sanctum procedens regit 
universum. 	@1 ex.$ 	@2 i Procedens.$ 	@3 T i et, and translators have accepted this insertion, but neither A nor I has it, nor is it needed if Humano Divino be regarded as an impersonal instrumental 
ablative. A had at first ita ex Divino Ipso, Humano Divino et Procedente regit universum. The amended form is far more exclusive.$ </p>
