<h3 align="center" class="ired">属天的奥秘 第8762节</h3>
<h4 align="center"></h4><p><strong>8762.</strong>“你要这样对雅各家说，告诉以色列人”表对那些属于外在和内在属灵教会之人的拯救。这从“说”和“告诉”，以及“雅各家”和“以色列人”的含义清楚可知：“说”和“告诉”在此是指拯救，因为耶和华通过摩西所说和告诉他们的话都是关于拯救的；“雅各家”和“以色列人”是指外在和内在的教会（参看<a href="3305.htm">3305</a>，<a href="4286.htm">4286</a>节）。至于何谓外在教会、何谓内在教会，这在前面几个地方早已阐明，即：古教会的外在是代表内在的一切，而该教会的内在则是那外在所代表的。例如，那些认为神性敬拜在于代表主国度的属灵和属天事物的祭祀，宗教仪式和律例的人就处于外在；而那些认为神性敬拜同时还在于所代表的属天和属灵事物的人则处于内在。如今也是一样。有些人认为神性敬拜在于常去教会、听讲道、领受圣餐，并且以虔诚的方式做这些事，却没有进一步思想它们，只是认为应当经常做这些事，因为它们是被制定并要求的。这些人就属于外在教会，而有些人同时认为这些事是要参与的，但认为敬拜的本质要素是信之生活，也就是对邻之仁和对主之爱。这些人就属于内在教会。所以，那些仅出于信所生顺服的灵而向邻舍行善并敬拜主的人也属于外在教会；而那些出于爱向邻舍行善并敬拜主的人则属于内在教会。其它体现教会的这两个方面的一切例证也是如此。<br />然而，每个教会成员都必有这二者，即一个外在和一个内在。没有这二者，就没有与他同在的属灵生命，因为内在就像灵魂，外在就像灵魂的身体。但那些属于外在教会的人在教会的外在上是清晰的，在它的内在上却是模糊的；而那些属于内在教会的人则在内在上是清晰的，在外在上是模糊的。不过，那些处于外在，同时未处于内在的人并不属于教会。所有照其教会的教导而过一种良善生活的人都处于这二者；但那些进行敬拜，同时却没有照其教会的教导而过一种良善生活的人则处于没有内在的外在。很少有人知道这一切；之所以很少有人知道，是因为人们认为敬拜、因而一切拯救完全在于信，根本不在于仁。也正因如此，那些思想永恒救赎的人认为它在于虔诚的生活，根本不在于仁爱的生活（对此，参看<a href="8252.htm">8252</a>-<a href="8257.htm">8257</a>节）。</p>

Thus shalt thou say to the house of Jacob, and declare to the sons of Israel. That this signifies the salvation of those who are of the external and internal spiritual church, is evident from the signification 
of "saying," and "declaring," as here being salvation, for the things which are now said and declared by Jehovah through Moses involve salvation; and from the signification of "the house of 
Jacob," and "the sons of Israel," as being the external and internal church (see n. 3305, 4286). What is meant by the external church and the internal church has been already stated in several places, 
namely, that the external of the Ancient Church was all that which represented the internal, and that the internal of the church was that which was represented by the externals. As for example, they 
who made Divine worship consist in sacrifices, and in rites and statutes, which represented spiritual and heavenly things of the Lord's kingdom, were in externals; but they who made Divine worship consist 
at the same time in the celestial and spiritual things which were represented, were in internals. In like manner at this day, they who make Divine worship consist in frequenting temples, hearing 
preachings, attending the Holy Supper, and who do these things with devotion, without thinking any further about them than that they ought to be frequented because they are instituted and commanded, 
these are of the external church; whereas they who at the same time believe that such things are to be attended to, but that still the essential of worship is the life of faith, that is, charity toward 
the neighbor and love to the Lord, these are of the internal church. Consequently also they are of the external church who do what is good to the neighbor and worship the Lord merely from the obedience 
of faith; whereas they are of the internal church who do what is good to the neighbor and worship the Lord from love. So in all other cases. [2] Nevertheless with everyone who is of the church there 
must be both, namely, an external and an internal. If there are not both there is no spiritual life with him, for the internal is like a soul, and the external is like the body of the soul. But they 
who are of the external church are clearly in its externals and obscurely in its internals, whereas they who are of the internal church are clearly in internals and obscurely in externals. But those 
who are in externals and not at the same time in internals are not of the church. All those are in both who are in the good of life according to the teachings of their church; but those are in externals 
without internals who are in worship and not at the same time in the good of life according to the teachings of the church. There are few who know this, and the reason why few know it, is that they 
make all worship, and thereby all salvation, consist in faith, and not at all in charity. From this also it is that they who think about eternal salvation make it consist in a life of piety, and not 
at all in a life of charity (on which see n. 8252-8257). </p>

'Thus you shall say to the house of Jacob, and tell the children of Israel' means the salvation of those belonging to the spiritual Church, external and internal. This is clear from the meaning of 'saying' 
and 'telling' here as salvation, for what Jehovah now says and tells them through Moses is all about salvation; and from the meaning of 'the house of Jacob' and 'the children of Israel' as the 
external Church and the internal Church, dealt with in <a href="3305.htm">3305</a>, <a href="4286.htm">4286</a>. What the external Church and the internal Church are has been stated before in several places, where it was shown that the external aspect 
of the Ancient Church involved everything representing the internal, while the internal aspect of the Church was that which external things represented. People for example who considered Divine 
worship to consist in sacrifices, and in religious ceremonies and rules, which represented the spiritual and celestial realities of the Lord's kingdom, were concerned with external things, whereas those 
who considered Divine worship to consist at the same time in the celestial and spiritual realities that were represented were concerned with internal things. It is similar at the present day. Some 
people consider Divine worship to consist in going to church, listening to sermons, attending the Holy Supper, and doing these things in a devout manner, yet do not think of them except as duties to be 
done regularly because they have been instituted and commanded. Those people belong to the external Church. Others however likewise believe that such duties should be attended to, but that nevertheless 
the essential element of worship is the life of faith, which is charity towards the neighbour and love to the Lord. These people belong to the internal Church. Consequently those also belong to the 
external Church who do good to the neighbour and worship the Lord, but solely in a spirit of obedience born of faith, whereas those belong to the internal Church who do good to the neighbour and worship 
the Lord out of love. And so on with all else exemplifying those two aspects of the Church. </p>

 But with every member of the Church both aspects must be present, the external and the internal. 
Unless both are present spiritual life does not exist with him; for the internal is so to speak the soul, and the external so to speak the body housing the soul. Those however who belong to the external 
Church are plainly concerned with external things of the Church and only vaguely with internal ones, whereas those belonging to the internal Church are plainly concerned with internal things and vaguely 
with external ones. But those concerned only with external things and not at the same time with internal do not belong to the Church. A concern for both exists with all who lead a good life in 
accordance with the teachings of their Church. But a concern for external things alone without internal exists with those who engage in acts of worship yet do not at the same time lead a good life in 
accordance with the teachings of their Church. There are few who know this; and the reason why few know it is that people consider worship and therefore salvation to consist wholly in faith, and not at 
all in charity. So it is also that those who think about eternal salvation consider it to consist in the religious life and not at all in the life of charity, regarding which kinds of life see <a href="8252.htm">8252</a>-<a href="8257.htm">8257</a>. </p>

`Ita dices domui Jacobi et nuntiabis filiis Israelis': quod significet salvationem illorum qui ab Ecclesia spirituali externa et interna, constat ex significatione `dicere' et `nuntiare' quod hic (x)sit 
salvatio, nam quae nunc dicuntur et nuntiantur a Jehovah {1}per Moschen, salvationem involvunt; ex significatione `domus Jacobi' et `filiorum Israelis' quod sint Ecclesia externa et interna, de qua 
n. 3305, 4286.  Quid Ecclesia externa et Ecclesia interna, prius aliquibus in locis dictum est, quod nempe externum Ecclesiae Antiquae fuerit omne id quod {2}repraesentabat internum, (c)et quod internum 
Ecclesiae fuerit {3} quod per externa repraesentatum est; sicut pro exemplo: qui cultum Divinum posuerunt in sacrificiis, inque ritibus (c)et statutis, quae repraesentabant spiritualia et caelestia 
regni Domini, illi in externis erant, at qui cultum Divinum simul posuerunt in caelestibus et spiritualibus quae repraesentata sunt, illi in internis erant; similiter hodie, qui cultum Divinum ponunt 
in frequentare templa, auscultare praedicationes, obire Sanctam Cenam, {4}et illa cum devotione, nec {5}alterius de illis cogitare quam quod frequentanda sint quia instituta et mandata {6}, illi ab 
Ecclesia externa sunt; at qui simul credunt quod {7}talia obeunda sint, sed quod usque essentiale cultus (x)sit vita fidei, hoc est, charitas erga proximum et amor in Dominum, illi ab Ecclesia interna 
sunt; {8}proinde etiam ab Ecclesia externa sunt qui faciunt bonum proximo et colunt Dominum solum ex oboedientia fidei, at ab Ecclesia interna sunt qui faciunt bonum proximo et colunt Dominum ex amore; 
ita in reliquis. 	2 Ast apud unumquemvis qui ab Ecclesia est, utrumque erit, nempe externum et internum, {9} si non utrumque, non {10}est vita spiritualis apud illum, nam internum {11} est sicut 
anima, et externum {12} sicut animae corpus; sed qui ab externa Ecclesia sunt, illi sunt clare in externis ejus at obscure in internis, at qui ab Ecclesia interna sunt, illi sunt clare in internis et 
obscure in externis.  At qui in externis sunt et non {13}simul in internis, illi non ab Ecclesia sunt; in {14}ambobus sunt omnes illi qui in bono vitae sunt secundum Ecclesiae suae doctrinalia; at in 
{15}externis absque {16}internis sunt qui in cultu et non simul in bono vitae secundum doctrinalia Ecclesiae sunt.  Pauci sunt qui hoc sciunt; {17} quod pauci id sciant, est quia ponunt omne cultus et 
inde omne salutis in fide, et nihil in charitate; {18}inde etiam est quod qui cogitant de salute aeterna ponant illam in vita pietatis et nihil in vita charitatis, de quibus videatur n. 8252-8257. 	@1
