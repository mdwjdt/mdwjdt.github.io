<h3 align="center" class="ired">属天的奥秘 第4807节</h3>
<h4 align="center"></h4><p><strong>4807.</strong><h4 align="center">第38章</h4><br />最后的审判（续）<br />在前一章头几节（<a href="4661.htm">4661</a>-<a href="4664.htm">4664</a>节），我们开始解释主在马太福音（<a href="http://39-27.cn/太25.31.htm">25:31</a>-<a href="http://39-27.cn/太25.46.htm">46</a>）中所说关于审判的话，也就是对在那里被称为绵羊和山头的善人与恶人的审判。这些话的内义尚未得到解释；不过，现在我们会在本章和接下来几章的头几节予以解释。从这些解释将清楚看出，在这个比喻中，最后的审判不是指世界末日，那时死人第一次复活，并聚集在主面前受审判；而是指每个人离开尘世进入来世的这个点就是审判他的时间；这才是审判的意思。然而，这一事实从字义看不出来，只能从内义看出来。主之所以以这种方式说话，是因为祂用代表和有意义的符号说话，如在旧约和新约的其它地方一样。因为用代表和有意义的符号说话，就是用同时向尘世和天堂，也就是向世人和天使说话。这种话语因具有普遍性，故是神性，因而于圣言是合适的。所以，那些在尘世只对世俗事物感兴趣的人并不明白主在此所说关于最后审判的话，只是认为所有人将在同一个时间复活，甚至认为那时主将坐在荣耀的宝座上，向聚集起来的人说这些话。而那些对属天事物感兴趣的人则知道，每个人复活之时，就是他死亡之时，主在比喻中所说的话表明：每个人将照自己的生活受审判，因此每个人都自带对他的审判，因为他带着自己的生活。</p>

Genesis 38   THE LAST JUDGMENT </p>
<p>Before the preceding chapter (n. 4661-4664) a beginning was made of unfolding what the Lord says in Matthew (chap. 25 from verse 31 to the end) concerning the Judgment 
upon the good and the evil, who are there called sheep and goats. What the internal sense of these words is, has not yet been unfolded, but is now to be unfolded before this and some following chapters. 
And it will then be evident that by the Last Judgment is not there meant the last time of the world, and that the dead will then for the first time rise again and be gathered together before the 
Lord and judged; but that there is meant the last time of everyone who passes out of the world into the other life; for then is his Judgment, and this is the Judgment which is meant. Yet that this 
is so does not appear from the sense of the letter, but from the internal sense. The reason why the Lord so spoke, is that He spoke here, as everywhere else in the Word of the Old and the New Testament, 
by representatives and significatives; for to speak by representatives and significatives is to speak at the same time to the world and to heaven, or to men and to angels. Such speech is Divine, because 
universal, and hence is proper to the Word. Wherefore they who are in the world and care for worldly things only, do not apprehend anything else from what the Lord says here concerning the Last 
Judgment than that all are to rise again at one and the same time, and even that the Lord will then sit upon a throne of glory, and will speak to those gathered together according to these words. But 
they who care for heavenly things know that the time of everyone's resurrection is when he dies, and that the Lord's words here involve that everyone will be judged according to his life, thus that everyone 
carries his judgment with him, because he carries his life. </p>

<p>In the preliminary section of the previous chapter, in <a href="4661.htm">4661</a>-<a href="4664.htm">4664</a>, an explanation was begun of what, in <a href="http://bible.gospelcom.net/cgi-bin/bible?passage=Matthew%2025:31-end&amp;version=ESV&amp;interface=print&amp;showfn=yes&amp;showxref">Matthew 25:31-end</a>, the Lord said about judgement on the good and the evil, who are there called 
the sheep and the goats. What the internal sense of those words is has not yet been explained, but comes up for explanation now in the preliminary sections of this and a couple of chapters<A name="fntext1"></a><A href="#fn1"><sup>a</sup></a> following 
it. From these explanations it will be clear that by a last judgement in this parable He did not mean a last phase of the world, when - for the first time - the dead will rise again and will be 
gathered before the Lord and will be judged, but that He meant the last phase of a person passing over from the world to the next life, this point being his time of judgement. This is the judgement He 
meant. But none of this is seen from the sense of the letter, only from the internal sense. The reason the Lord spoke in the way He did is that He spoke using representatives and meaningful signs, as 
He has done everywhere else in the Old Testament Word and in the New. For to speak using representatives and meaningful signs is to speak simultaneously to the world and to heaven, that is, both to men 
and to angels. This kind of speech, being universal, is Divine and therefore proper to the Word. Consequently, those who are in the world and are interested only in worldly matters grasp nothing else 
from the words spoken by the Lord regarding a last judgement than the idea that everyone's resurrection will take place at one and the same point in time, when the Lord will sit on a throne of glory 
and address those gathered together there in the words used in the parable. But those who are interested in heavenly matters know that each person rises again at the point in time when he dies, and 
that the Lord's words in the parable carry the teaching that everyone will be judged according to what his life is, thus that everyone brings his judgement with him because he brings his life with him.

GENESEOS CAPUT TRIGESIMUM OCTAVUM </p>
<p>Ante caput praecedens, n. 4661-4664, inceptum est explicare quae Dominus apud Matthaeum xxv a 31 ad fin: locutus est de judicio super bonos et malos, qui ibi 
vocantur oves et hirci; </p>
<p>quis sensus internus illorum verborum est, nondum explicatum est, sed nunc ante hoc et aliquot {1} sequentia capita, explicandum venit; et inde constabit quod per ultimum judicium 
ibi non intellectum sit ultimum tempus mundi et quod tunc primum resurgent mortui et congregabuntur coram Domino et judicabuntur, sed quod intellectum sit ultimum tempus cujusvis qui e mundo 
in alteram vitam transit, tunc enim est judicium ejus; hoc judicium est quod intelligitur.  At quod ita sit, non apparet ex sensu litterae, sed ex sensu interno; quod Dominus ita locutus sit, est 
quia per repraesentativa et significativa locutus est, sicut ubivis alibi in Verbo Veteris et {2} Novi Testamenti; loqui enim per repraesentativa et significativa, est loqui simul coram mundo et coram 
caelo, seu coram hominibus et coram angelis; talis loquela est Divina quia universalis, et inde est propria Verbi; quapropter qui in mundo sunt et non nisi quam mundana curant, non aliud ex his quae 
Dominus de ultimo judicio locutus est, capiunt quam quod resurrectionis tempus simul erit omnibus, immo quod Dominus tunc sedebit super throno gloriae (c)et dicet ad congregatos secundum verba 
ibi {3}; at qui caelestia curant, illi sciunt quod tempus resurrectionis sit cuivis {4} cum moritur, et quod Domini verba ibi involvant quod unusquisque secundum vitam judicabitur, ita quod unusquisque 
judicium secum ferat, quia vitam.      @1 aliqua$      @2 tam Veteris quam$      @3 illa$      @4 unicuivis$ </p>
