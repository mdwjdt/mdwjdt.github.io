The man who has been regenerated is in heaven as to his internal man, and is an angel there with angels, among whom also he comes after death. He can then live the life of heaven, love the Lord, love 
the neighbor, understand truth, relish good, and perceive blessedness therefrom. These things are the happiness of eternal life.            EXODUS 19 </p>
<p>     1. In the third month of the going forth 
of the sons of Israel out of the land of Egypt, in this day they came into the wilderness of Sinai.      2. And they journeyed from Rephidim, and came into the wilderness of Sinai, and encamped in 
the wilderness; and there Israel encamped close to the mountain.      3. And Moses went up unto God, and Jehovah called unto him from the mountain, saying, Thus shalt thou say to the house of Jacob, 
and declare to the sons of Israel: </p>
<p>     4. Ye have seen what I did to the Egyptians, and I bare you on eagles' wings, and brought you unto Me.      5. And now, if hearing ye shall hear My voice, and 
keep My covenant, then ye shall be Mine own possession above all peoples; for all the earth is Mine: </p>
<p>     6. And ye shall be to Me a kingdom of priests, and a holy nation. These are the words which 
thou shalt speak unto the sons of Israel.      7. And Moses came and called the elders of the people, and set before them all these words which Jehovah commanded him.      8. And all the people answered 
together, and said, All that Jehovah hath spoken we will do. And Moses reported the words of the people unto Jehovah.      9. And Jehovah said unto Moses, Behold I come unto thee in the density 
of the cloud, that the people may hear when I speak with thee, and may also believe in thee to eternity; and Moses declared the words of the people unto Jehovah.      10. And Jehovah said unto Moses, 
Go unto the people, and sanctify them today and tomorrow, and let them wash their garments.      11. And let them be ready against the third day, because in the third day Jehovah will come down unto 
the eyes of all the people upon Mount Sinai.      12. And thou shalt set bounds to the people round about, saying, Take heed to yourselves, that ye go not up into the mountain, or touch the extremity 
of it; everyone that toucheth the mountain, dying he shall die: </p>
<p>     13. No hand shall touch it, because stoning he shall be stoned, or shooting he shall be shot; if a beast, if a man, he shall not 
live; when the jobel is drawn out, they shall come up into the mountain.      14. And Moses went down from the mountain unto the people, and sanctified the people, and they washed their garments.  
    15. And he said unto the people, Be ready for three days, come not near unto a woman.      16. And it was on the third day, when it was morning, that there were voices and lightnings, and a heavy 
cloud upon the mountain, and the voice of a trumpet exceeding strong, and all the people that were in the camp trembled.      17. And Moses made the people go forth out of the camp to meet God; and 
they took their stand in the lower parts of the mountain.      18. And Mount Sinai smoked, the whole of it, because Jehovah descended upon it in fire; and the smoke thereof ascended as the smoke of a 
furnace, and the whole mountain trembled mightily.      19. And when the voice of the trumpet was going, and waxing strong mightily, Moses spake, and God answered him in a voice.      20. And Jehovah 
came down upon Mount Sinai, unto the head of the mountain; and Jehovah called Moses unto the head of the mountain, and Moses went up.      21. And Jehovah said unto Moses, Go down, charge the people, 
lest perchance they break through unto Jehovah to see, and many of them fall.      22. And the priests also, who come near unto Jehovah, shall sanctify themselves, lest perchance Jehovah make a breach 
in them.      23. And Moses said unto Jehovah, The people cannot come up unto Mount Sinai; for Thou didst charge us, saying, Set bounds to the mountain, and sanctify it.      24. And Jehovah said 
unto him, Go, get thee down; and come up thou, and Aaron with thee; and let not the priests and the people break through to come up unto Jehovah, lest perchance He make a breach in them.      25. 
And Moses went down unto the people, and told them. </p>

Homo qui regeneratus est, quoad internum suum hominem in caelo est, ac ibi angelus cum angelis, inter quos etiam post mortem venit; is tunc potest vivere vitam caeli, amare Dominum, amare proximum,

ad DEUM; et vocavit ad illum JEHOVAH e monte, dicendo, Ita dices domui Jacobi, et nuntiabis filiis Israelis. 	4.  Vos vidistis quod feci Aegyptiis, et tuli vos super alis aquilarum, et adduxi vos 
ad Me. 	5.  Et nunc si audiendo audiveritis vocem Meam, et custodiveritis foedus Meum, et eritis Mihi peculium {1}prae omnibus populis; quia Mihi omnis terra. 	@1 d ab i prae  cp n. 8759 and n. 8768$ 	6. 
 Et vos eritis Mihi regnum sacerdotum, et gens sancta; haec verba quae loqueris ad filios Israelis. 	7.  Et venit Moscheh, et vocavit seniores populi, et posuit coram illis omnia verba illa 
quae praecepit (x)illi JEHOVAH. 	8.  Et responderunt omnis populus simul, et dixerunt, Omne quod locutus JEHOVAH faciemus; et retulit Moscheh verba populi ad JEHOVAM. 	9.  Et dixit JEHOVAH ad Moschen, 
Ecce Ego veniens ad te in densitate nubis, propterea ut audiat populus in loquendo Me tecum, et etiam in te credent {1}ad aeternum; et nuntiavit Moscheh verba populi ad JEHOVAM. 	@1 d in aeternum

tertio descendet JEHOVAH ad oculos omnis populi {1}super montem Sinai. 	@1 supra IT$ 	12.  Et terminos ponas populo circumcirca, dicendo, Cavete vobis ascendere in montem et tangere extremitatem ejus;

 Et fuit in die tertio in fieri mane, et fuit voces et fulgura, et nubes gravis super monte, et vox buccinae vehemens valde, et trepidabat omnis populus qui in castris. 	17.  Et exire fecit Moscheh 
populum obviam DEO e castris, et constiterunt in inferioribus montis. 	18.  Et mons Sinai fumabat totus ille, propter quod descendit super illum JEHOVAH in igne, et ascendit fumus ejus sicut fumus 
fornacis, et tremiscebat totus mons valde. 	19.  Et fuit vox buccinae vadens et fortificans se valde; Moscheh (x)loquebatur et DEUS respondebat illi in voce. 	20.  Et descendit JEHOVAH super montem 
Sinai ad caput montis, et vocavit JEHOVAH Moschen ad caput montis, et ascendit Moscheh. 	21.  Et dixit JEHOVAH ad Moschen, Descende, obtestare populum ne forte perrumpant ad JEHOVAM ad videndum, et 
cadat de eo multus. 	22.  Et etiam sacerdotes accedentes ad JEHOVAM sanctificabunt se, ne forte rupturam faciat in illis JEHOVAH. 	23.  Et dixit Moscheh ad JEHOVAH, Non potest populus ascendere ad montem 
Sinai, quia Tu contestatus es in nos, dicendo, Terminos pone monti, et sanctifica eum. 	24.  Et dixit ad illum JEHOVAH, Abi, descende, et ascendas tu et Aharon tecum, et sacerdotes et populus ne 
perrumpant ad ascendendum ad JEHOVAM, ne forte rupturam faciat in illis. 	25.  Et descendit Moscheh ad populum, et dixit ad illos. </p>
