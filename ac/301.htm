<h3 align="center" class="ired">属天的奥秘 第301节</h3>
<h4 align="center"></h4><p><strong>301.</strong>再说第二个奥秘——他们若被教导信的奥秘，必要永远灭亡，亦即“现在恐怕他伸手又取生命树吃，就永远活着”所表之义。这是因为，当人的生命次序颠倒了，意图凭自己而活，或凭自己获取智慧，就以理性推导他所听闻的信仰。当他以自己的感官和知识来推导信仰时，就不可避免地走向否认，终而亵渎之，污蔑之，将污秽与圣洁混淆。人若变得如此，等到了灵界，他将受尽罪责，无丝毫得救之望。因为当污秽与圣洁混淆了，一旦有圣洁之念升起，污秽之念也随同浮现，导致他不能进入任何群体，只能下到地狱。<br />在灵界，人所混杂的思想念头很容易被觉察，精灵界之灵尚能如此，何况天使灵。通过一个念头，他们能洞察一个人的秉性。要分离已混淆的污秽之念和圣洁之念，只有一个手段，就是假借地狱之苦。人若知道那是怎样的痛苦，必要小心翼翼，如防备地狱一样避免亵渎。</p>

<p><strong>[NCE]301.</strong> The other secret is that if they had learned the mysteries of faith, they would have been destroyed forever. Such is the meaning of the words now perhaps people will put out their hand and take from the tree of lives as well, and eat, and live forever. The situation is this:<br />People can reach a point where the structure of their life is turned upside down; they have no interest in receiving life or wisdom from any other source than themselves and their own powers. Under these circumstances, when they hear anything about faith, no matter what it is, they debate in their minds whether it is true or not. Because they make themselves — their sense impressions and the facts they have learned — their authority, they cannot help denying; and when they deny, they blaspheme and profane. They end up with no concern about whether they are intermingling profane and holy things.<br />If this is what we become, we are so utterly damned when we enter the other life that no hope of salvation remains; and this is because things that are mingled together through profanation cling to each other in their mixed condition. As soon as an image of something holy comes to our minds, the attached image of something profane appears, preventing us from keeping company with any but the damned. (People in the next life — even the spirits in the world of spirits, and more so the angelic spirits — keenly perceive what is present in, and linked with, the ideas that make up our thinking. Their perception is so keen that from a single thought they can tell what we are like.)<br />Profane things attached in this way to holy things cannot be wrenched apart from them without the tortures of hell — tortures so intense that if we knew about them, we would stay as far away from profanation as we would from hell itself. </p>

The other arcanum is that had they been instructed in the mysteries of faith they would have perished eternally, which is signified by the words, "now lest he put forth his hand, and take also of the 
tree of lives, and eat, and live to eternity." The case is this: When men have become inverted orders of life, and are unwilling to live, or to become wise, except from themselves and from their Own, 
they reason about everything they hear respecting faith, as to whether it is so, or not; and as they do this from themselves and from their own things of sense and of memory-knowledge, it must needs 
lead to denial, and consequently to blasphemy and profanation, so that at length they do not scruple to mix up profane things with holy. When a man becomes like this, he is so condemned in the other life 
that there remains for him no hope of salvation. For things mixed up by profanation remain so mixed up, so that whenever any idea of something holy presents itself, an idea of something profane that 
is conjoined with it is also there, the consequence of which is that the person cannot be in any society except one of the damned. Whatever is present in any idea of thought in consequence of being 
conjoined with it, is most exquisitely perceived in the other life, even by spirits in the world of spirits, and much more so by angelic spirits, so exquisitely indeed that from a single idea they know 
a person's character. The separation of profane and holy ideas when thus conjoined cannot be effected except by means of such infernal torment that if a man were aware of it he would as carefully avoid 
profanation as he would avoid hell itself. </p>

As regards the second arcanum, if they had been instructed in mysteries of faith they would have perished for ever, meant by the words 'Now by chance he will put out his hand and also take from the tree 
of life<A name="fntext1"></a><A href="#fn1"><sup>a</sup></a> and eat, and live forever', the position is this: Once people have become reversed orders of life and are unwilling to rely on anything but self and the proprium as the source of their life 
and wisdom, they are given to reasoning as to whether any matter of faith which they hear about is so or not so. And because self, sensory evidence, and facts are the basis of their reasoning, they 
inevitably adopt a negative attitude. And when their attitude is negative they also speak blasphemy and practise profanation, and at length do not care whether or not they mingle together unholy things 
with holy. When man becomes such he stands so condemned in the next life that there is no hope of salvation for him, for the things that have been mingled through acts of profanation remain that way 
permanently. The moment some idea of what is holy enters in, so does the idea joined to it of what is unholy, and this makes it impossible for that person to live in any but a community of people who 
are condemned. Anything at all that has been joined to, and is present as, an idea within a person's thought is in the next life perceived very precisely even by spirits in the world of spirits, but 
more so by angelic spirits. It is perceived so precisely that from merely one idea they know his whole character. Getting rid of unholy things such as are joined on to those that are holy is not possible 
without hellish torment, which is so intense that if man knew about it he would beware of profanation as of hell itself.

</p><b>301.</b>
Alterum arcanum est, si instructi fuissent mysteriis fidei, quod in aeternum periissent, quod significatur per haec verba, 'nunc forte mittet manum suam, et sumet etiam ab arbore vitarum, et edat, et 
vivat in aeternum'; ita se habet: cum homines inversi ordines vitae facti sunt, et non volunt nisi ex semet et proprio vivere et sapere, tunc {x}quicquid audiunt quod est fidei, ratiocinantur nam ita 
sit vel non; et quia ex semet, suis sensualibus et scientificis, non possunt aliter quam negare, et cum negant, etiam blasphemant et profanant; et tandem nec curant si profana sanctis commisceant: cum 
homo talis fit, tunc in altera vita ita damnatus est ut non aliqua spes salutis; quae enim per profanationes commixta sunt, adhaerent commixta; ut primum aliqua idea sancti venit, etiam idea profani 
conjuncta adest, quod facit ut in non alia societate esse possit quam in damnatorum: in altera vita exquisitissime percipitur, etiam a spiritibus in mundo spirituum, magis a spiritibus angelicis, quicquid 
alicui cogitationis ideae adest conjunctum, ita exquisite ut ex unica solum idea sciant qualis est. Ut profana talia adjuncta sanctis discutiantur, non fit nisi cum cruciatu infernali, et tanto 
ut si homo sciret, caveret sibi a profanatione ut ab ipso inferno. </p>
