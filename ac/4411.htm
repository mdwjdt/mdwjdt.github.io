<h3 align="center" class="ired">属天的奥秘 第4411节</h3>
<h4 align="center"></h4><p><strong>4411.</strong>眼睛的每一个部位在众天堂都有自己的对应物，如这三种体液：水样液，玻璃体液和晶状液就是如此；不仅体液是这样，而且膜，甚至一切部位都是这样。眼睛的更内在部位拥有更美丽、更快乐的对应物；然而，这些对应物在此天堂和彼天堂是不同的。当从主发出的光流入至内在或第三层天堂时，它在那里作为被称为仁爱的良善被接受；当这光或直接或间接流入中间或第二层天堂时，它作为根植于仁爱的真理被接受；但当这真理或直接或间接流入最低或第一层天堂时，它以属灵物质所形成的物体被接受，在那里看似天堂花园，在有些地方则看似含有宫殿的城市。这些对应物就这样一个接一个地连续呈现给天使的外在视觉。人也一样。在他的终端部位，也就是眼睛里面，所流入的真理通过眼睛的视觉以物质形式呈现自己，其物体就是可见世界中的物体。当爱与仁，因而信存在于人里面时，他的内层就具有上述对应物的性质，因为他对应于三层天堂，就像一个微型天堂。</p>

<p align="center"><b>Potts(1905-1910) 4411</b></p><p><b>4411.</b>
Each and all things that are in the eye have their correspondences in the heavens, such as the three humors, the aqueous, the vitreous, and the crystalline; and not the humors only, but also the coats, 
and indeed every part. The more interior things of the eye have correspondences more beautiful and more pleasant, but in a different manner in each heaven. When the light which proceeds from the Lord 
flows into the inmost or third heaven, it is there received as the good which is called charity; and when it flows into the middle or second heaven, both mediately and immediately, it is received as 
the truth which is from charity; but when this truth flows into the lowest or first heaven, mediately and immediately, it is received substantially, and appears there as a paradise, and in some places 
as a city in which are palaces. Thus do the correspondences succeed one another even to the external sight of the angels. It is similar with man, in his ultimate which is the eye this truth is presented 
materially by the sight, the objects of which are those of the visible world. The man who is in love and charity, and consequently in faith, has his interiors of this quality, for he corresponds 
to the three heavens, and is a little heaven in effigy. </p>

<p align="center"><b>Elliott(1983-1999) 4411</b></p><p><b>4411.</b>
Every single part of the eye has its own corresponding counterpart in the heavens. This is so, for example, with the three humours, the aqueous, the vitreous, and the crystalline; and not only with the 
humours but also with the tunics, indeed with every part. The more interior parts of the eye have more beautiful and delightful corresponding counterparts, which however are different in one heaven 
from in another. When the light which proceeds from the Lord flows into the inmost or third heaven it is received there as good which is called charity. When it flows into the middle or second heaven, 
directly or indirectly, it is received as truth which is rooted in charity. But when this truth flows into the ultimate or first heaven, indirectly or directly, it is received in objects formed from 
spiritual substance and is to be seen there as a paradise garden, or in other places as a city containing palaces. This is how those counterparts, rising one above the other, present themselves to angels' 
external sight. It is similar in man. In his ultimate part, which is his eye, that inflowing truth presents itself in a material form, by means of the sight of the eye, whose objects are those existing 
in the visible world. When love and charity, and consequently faith, exist in a person, his interiors are like the counterparts described above, for he corresponds to the three heavens and resembles 
a miniature heaven. </p>

</p><b>4411.</b>
Omnia et singula quae sunt in oculo, habent suas correspondentias in caelis, sicut tres humores {1}, aqueus, vitreus, et crystallinus; nec solum humores, sed etiam tunicae, immo unaquaevis pars; 
quae interiora oculi sunt, correspondentias pulchriores et amoeniores habent, sed differenter in unoquovis caelo.  (s)Lux illa quae a Domino procedit, cum influit in intimum seu tertium caelum, recipitur 
ibi ut bonum quod vocatur charitas; </p>
<p>et cum influit in medium seu secundum caelum, mediate et immediate, recipitur ut verum quod ex charitate; at cum verum hoc influit in ultimum seu primum caelum, 
mediate et immediate, recipitur substantialiter, et apparet ibi sicut paradisus, et alibi sicut civitas in qua palatia; ita succedunt correspondentiae usque ad visum angelorum externum: in homine 
similiter, in ejus ultimo quod est oculus, sistitur id materialiter, per visum, cujus objecta sunt quae sunt mundi aspectabilis: homo qui in amore et charitate et inde in fide est, habet interiora 
sua talia, nam correspondet tribus caelis, et est in effigie parvulum caelum.(s)      @1 i ibi$ </p>
