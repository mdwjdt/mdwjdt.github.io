<h3 align="center" class="ired">属天的奥秘 第4696节</h3>
<h4 align="center"></h4><p><strong>4696.</strong>“看哪，太阳、月亮”表属世良善和属世真理。这从“太阳”和“月亮”的含义清楚可知：“太阳”是指属天良善（<a href="1529.htm">1529</a>，<a href="1530.htm">1530</a>，<a href="2120.htm">2120</a>，<a href="2441.htm">2441</a>，<a href="2495.htm">2495</a>，<a href="3636.htm">3636</a>，<a href="3643.htm">3643</a>，<a href="4060.htm">4060</a>节）；“月亮”是指属灵良善，也就是真理（<a href="1529.htm">1529</a>，<a href="1530.htm">1530</a>，<a href="2495.htm">2495</a>节）。“太阳”在至高意义上表示主，因为祂向那些在天堂处于属天之爱的人显为一轮太阳；“月亮”在至高意义上也表示主，因为祂向那些在天堂处于属灵之爱的人显为一轮月亮。而且，祂是天堂一切光的源头。因此，从天堂太阳所得来的光是爱的属天形式，也就是良善；从天堂月亮所得来的光是爱的属灵形式，也就是真理。故此处“太阳”表示属世良善，“月亮”表示属世真理，因为它们论及雅各和利亚；这从第10节经文明显看出来，在那里，雅各说：“难道我和你母亲、你弟兄果然要来俯伏在地，向你下拜吗”，因为“雅各”代表属世良善，“利亚”代表属世真理，如前面各处所述。出于主的神性在至高意义上就是祂里面的神性；但在相对意义上则是从祂发出的神性。从祂所得的神性良善就是那被称为属天的，从祂所得的神性真理就是那被称为属灵的。当理性层接受这些时，所表示的就是理性层的良善与真理；但当属世层接受它们时，所表示的就是属世层的良善与真理。它们在此是指属世层的良善与真理，因为这些话论及雅各和利亚。</p>

And behold the sun and the moon. That this signifies natural good and natural truth, is evident from the signification of the "sun," as being celestial good (n. 1529, 1530, 2120, 2441, 2495, 3636, 3643, 
4060); and from the signification of the "moon," as being spiritual good, or truth (n. 1529, 1530, 2495). The "sun" in the supreme sense signifies the Lord, because He appears as a sun to those in 
heaven who are in celestial love; and the "moon" also in the supreme sense signifies the Lord, because He appears as a moon to those in heaven who are in spiritual love; all the light in heaven is thence. 
Therefore the light from the sun there is the celestial of love, or good, and the light from the moon there is the spiritual of love, or truth; in the present passage therefore the "sun" is natural 
good, and the "moon" natural truth, because they are predicated of Jacob and Leah, as is evident from verse 10, where Jacob says, "Shall I and thy mother and thy brethren indeed come to bow down ourselves 
to thee to the earth?" for by Jacob is represented natural good, and by Leah natural truth, as before occasionally shown. The Divine which comes from the Lord is in the supreme sense the Divine 
in Him; but in the relative sense is the Divine from Him. The Divine good from Him is what is called celestial, and the Divine truth from Him is what is called spiritual. When the rational receives 
these, the good and the truth of the rational are what are signified; but when the natural receives them, the good and truth of the natural are what are signified. Here they are the good and truth of 
the natural, because they are predicated of Jacob and Leah. </p>

<p align="center"><b>Elliott(1983-1999) 4696</b></p><p><b>4696.</b>
'And behold, the sun and the moon' means natural good and natural truth. This is clear from the meaning of 'the sun' as celestial good, dealt with in <a href="1529.htm">1529</a>, <a href="1530.htm">1530</a>, <a href="2120.htm">2120</a>, <a href="2441.htm">2441</a>, <a href="2495.htm">2495</a>, <a href="3636.htm">3636</a>, <a href="3643.htm">3643</a>, <a href="4060.htm">4060</a>; and 
from the meaning of 'the moon' as spiritual good, which is truth, dealt with in <a href="1529.htm">1529</a>, <a href="1530.htm">1530</a>, <a href="2495.htm">2495</a>. In the highest sense 'the sun' means the Lord because He is seen as the sun by those in heaven who 
are governed by celestial love, and in the highest sense 'the moon' too means the Lord because He is seen as the moon by those in heaven who are governed by spiritual love. Also He is the source of every 
ray of light in heaven. Consequently the light received from the sun there is the celestial form of love, which is good, and the light received from the moon there is the spiritual form of love, which 
is truth. Here therefore 'the sun' means natural good and 'the moon' natural truth, since these two sources of light are used to refer to Jacob and Leah (as is evident from verse 10, where Jacob 
says, 'Shall we indeed come - I and your mother, and your brothers - to bow down to you to the earth?') and 'Jacob' represents natural good and 'Leah' natural truth, as shown already in various places. 
The Divine which comes from the Lord is in the highest sense the Divine within Him, but in the relative sense is the Divine going forth from Him. The Divine good received from Him is that which is called 
celestial, and the Divine truth received from Him is that which is referred to as spiritual. When the rational receives these it is in this case the good and truth of the rational that are meant; 
but when the natural receives them it is the good and truth of the natural that are meant. Here the good and truth of the natural are meant because the words used refer to Jacob and Leah. </p>

`Et ecce sol et luna': quod significet bonum naturale et verum naturale, constat a significatione `solis' quod sit bonum caeleste {1}, de qua n. 1529, 1530, 2120, 2441, 2495, 3636, 3643, 4060: et 
ex significatione `lunae' quod sit bonum spirituale seu verum, de qua n. 1529, 1530, 2495; `sol' in supremo sensu significat {2} Dominum quia Ipse ut sol apparet illis in caelo qui in caelesti amore 
sunt, et `luna' in supremo sensu etiam significat Dominum quia Ipse ut luna apparet illis in caelo qui in spirituali amore sunt; etiam omne lucis in caelo {3} est inde; lux ideo a sole ibi est caeleste 
amoris seu bonum, et lux a luna ibi est spirituale amoris (o)seu verum; hic itaque `sol' est bonum naturale et `luna' est verum naturale, quia praedicantur de Jacobo et Lea, ut patet a vers. 
10 ubi Jacob dicit `An veniendo veniemus ego et mater tua, et fratres tui, ad incurvandum nos tibi terram?'  Per `Jacobum' enim repraesentatur bonum naturale et per `Leam' verum naturale, ut prius 
passim ostensum est.  Divinum quod a Domino venit, hoc in supremo sensu est Divinum in Ipso, in sensu autem respectivo est Divinum ab Ipso; Divinum bonum quod ab Ipso, est quod vocatur caeleste, 
et Divinum verum quod ab Ipso, est quod dicitur spirituale; cum rationale illa recipit, sunt bonum et verum rationalis quae significantur, cum autem naturale illa recipit, sunt bonum {4} et verum naturalis 
quae significantur; hic bonum et verum naturalis quia praedicantur de Jacobo et Lea.      @1 A d amoris, i caeleste$      @2 i Ipsum$      @3 caelis$      @4 i naturalis$ </p>
