<h3 align="center" class="ired">属天的奥秘 第4217节</h3>
<h4 align="center"></h4><p><strong>4217.</strong>“拉班就离开，回自己的地方去了”表藉着拉班的代表的结束。这从“回自己的地方”的含义清楚可知：“回自己的地方”是指回到以前的状态。“地方”是指状态（参看<a href="2625.htm">2625</a>，<a href="2837.htm">2837</a>，<a href="3356.htm">3356</a>，<a href="3387.htm">3387</a>，<a href="3404.htm">3404</a>节）。所以，这句话表示藉着拉班的代表的结束。所说明的这一切清楚表明，圣言的每一个部分都包含内在事物，内在事物具有这样的性质：它们适合与人同在的天使来理解。例如：当圣言提到“饼或饭或粮”时，天使想到的是属灵的饼或饭或粮，而不是物质的饼或饭或粮；因此他们将饼或饭或粮理解为主，如祂自己在约翰福音（<a href="http://39-27.cn/约6.33.htm">6:33</a>，<a href="http://39-27.cn/约6.35.htm">35</a>）所教导的那样，祂是生命的粮。他们因理解为主，故理解为源于祂的事物，因而理解为祂对全人类的爱；同时理解为人回以主的爱；因为这两种爱会在一个思维和情感的观念中交织在一起。<br />以神圣状态接受圣餐之饼的人之思维与此无异；事实上，那时他想到的是主及其仁慈，是构成对祂的爱和对邻之仁的事物，而不是饼，因为他正在思想悔改和修正生活。然而，人们思想这些事的方式却因不仅存在于其思维，还存在于其情感中的神圣程度而各异。由此明显可知，当圣言提到“饼或饭或粮”时，呈现给天使的不是饼或饭或粮的概念，而是爱和关乎爱的无数事物之概念。当酒在圣言中被提及，以及在圣餐中被领受时，情况也一样。在这种情况下，天使根本不会思想酒，而是思想对邻之仁。正因如此，还由于人以这种方式与天堂相联，并通过天堂与主相联，故饼和酒就成了象征，将过着神圣生活的人与天堂联结起来，并通过天堂与主联结起来。<br />这同样适用于圣言中的每一个细节，因此圣言是联结人与主的媒介或手段。如果这样的联结媒介或手段，天堂不可能流到人那里；因为没有一个媒介或手段，联结是不可能的；相反，天堂会远离人；如果天堂远离了，任何人就再也不能被引入良善，甚至被引入物质和世俗的良善了；而是一切约束，包括外在的约束，都将被废除。因为主通过内在约束，也就是良知的约束来掌管处于良善的人；唯独通过外在约束掌管陷入邪恶的人。如果这些约束都被废除了，凡唯独被外在约束掌管的人都就会变得疯狂，就像不惧怕法律、自己的生命，也不惧怕丧失地位和利益，因而名声（这些都是外在约束）的人那样发疯，人类将因此灭亡。这解释了为何圣言存在，以及圣言的真正性质。拥有圣言的主之教会就像心与肺，没有圣言的主之教会就像从心肺获得生命的其它内在器官（参看<a href="637.htm">637</a>，<a href="931.htm">931</a>，<a href="2054.htm">2054</a>，<a href="2853.htm">2853</a>节）。</p>

And Laban departed and returned to his place. That this signifies the end of the representation by Laban, is evident from the signification of "returning to his place," as being to return to the former 
state. (That "place" is state, see above, n. 2625, 2837, 3356, 3387, 3404.) Consequently by these words is signified the end of the representation by Laban. From all that has been shown it may be seen 
that all things in the Word both in general and particular contain interior things, and that the interior things are of such a nature as to be adapted to the perception of the angels who are with 
man. For example: when "bread" is mentioned in the Word, the angels become aware not of material but of spiritual bread; thus instead of bread they perceive the Lord, who is the Bread of life, as He Himself 
teaches in John 6:33, 35.  And because they perceive the Lord, they perceive what is from the Lord, thus His love toward the universal human race; and they then perceive at the same time man's 
reciprocal love to the Lord; for these two things cohere in one idea of thought and affection.  [2] Not unlike this are the thoughts of the man who is in a holy state when receiving the bread of the 
Holy Supper; for he then thinks not of bread, but of the Lord and His mercy, and of what is of love to Him and of charity toward the neighbor, because he thinks of repentance and amendment of life; but 
this with variety according to the holiness in which he is, not only as to his thought, but also as to his affection. From this it is manifest that "bread" as mentioned in the Word suggests to the 
angels no idea of bread, but the idea of love, together with innumerable things that are of love. It is the same with "wine," which when read of in the Word, and also when received in the Holy Supper, 
suggests to the angels no thought of wine, but of charity toward the neighbor. This being the case, and as in this way there is a connection of man with heaven, and through heaven with the Lord, the 
bread and wine have become symbols, and unite the man who is in holiness of life with heaven, and through heaven with the Lord. [3] The same is the case with everything in the Word, and therefore the 
Word is a medium uniting man with the Lord; and unless there were such a uniting medium, heaven could not inflow with man; for without a medium there would be no unition, but heaven would remove itself 
away from man; and if this were removed, no one could any longer be led to good, not even to corporeal and worldly good; but all bonds whatever, even those which are external, would be broken. For 
the Lord rules the man who is in good by means of internal bonds, which are of conscience; but one who is in evil by external bonds alone; and if these should be broken, every such man would become insane; 
even as is the man who is without fear of the law, without fear for his life, and without fear of the loss of honor and gain, and thus of reputation-for these are the external bonds-and so the human 
race would perish. From all this it may be seen why the Word exists, and what the character of the Word is. (That the church of the Lord where the Word is, is like the heart and the lungs, and that 
the church of the Lord where the Word is not, is like the rest of the viscera which live from the heart and the lungs, may be seen above, n. 637, 931, 2054, 2853.) </p>

'And Laban went and resumed to his place' means the end of the representation by means of Laban. This is clear from the meaning of 'returning to his place' as going back to a previous state - for 'place' 
means state, see <a href="2625.htm">2625</a>, <a href="2837.htm">2837</a>, <a href="3356.htm">3356</a>, <a href="3387.htm">3387</a>, <a href="3404.htm">3404</a> - and therefore the words used here mean the end of the representation by means of Laban. All that has been shown makes it clear that every single part 
of the Word has an interior content, which is of such a nature that it is suited to the perception of the angels present with man. For example, when the word 'bread' is used in the Word the angels 
do not call to mind material bread but spiritual bread, and so instead of bread perceive the Lord who, as He Himself teaches in <a href="http://bible.gospelcom.net/cgi-bin/bible?passage=John%206:33,%2035&amp;version=ESV&amp;interface=print&amp;showfn=yes&amp;showxref">John 6:33, 35</a>, is the Bread of life. And because they perceive the Lord 
they perceive the things which derive from Him, and therefore His love towards the whole human race. In so doing they perceive at the same time man's reciprocal love to the Lord, for these two kinds of 
love are knit together within one idea occupying their thought and affection. </p>

<p><b>[2]</b>
 Not unlike this are the thoughts of the person who has a holy mind, when he receives the bread in the Holy Supper; 
for at that time he does not think of the bread but of the Lord and His mercy, and of the things which constitute love to Him and charity towards the neighbour, because he is thinking about repentance 
and amendment of life. Yet the way people think about these things varies according to the degree of holiness present not only in their thought but also in their affection. From this it is evident 
that when 'bread' is mentioned in the Word no idea of bread presents itself to angels but the idea of love and of countless things connected with love. It is similar when wine is referred to in the Word 
and also received in the Holy Supper. In this case angels do not think at all of wine but of charity towards the neighbour. This being so, and since man in this way is linked to heaven and through 
heaven to the Lord, bread and wine have been made the symbols and unite a person who leads a holy life to heaven, and through heaven to the Lord. </p>
<p></p>
<p><b>[3]</b>
 The same applies to every detail within the Word, 
and therefore the Word is the means by which man is united to the Lord. If that uniting means did not exist heaven would not be able to flow in with man - for without a means no uniting together would 
be possible - but would remove itself from him. And if heaven were removed it would no longer be possible for anyone to be led to that which is good, not even to physical and worldly good. Instead 
all restraints, including external ones, would be abolished. For the Lord governs the person in whom good dwells by means of internal restraints, which are those of conscience, whereas the person in 
whom evil dwells is governed solely by external restraints. If these were abolished everybody governed solely by external restraints would become insane in the way a person is insane who has no fear of 
the law, no fear for his life, nor any fear of losing position and gain, and so of reputation - for these are the external bonds - and so the human race would perish. This explains why the Word exists, 
and the true nature of the Word. The Lord's Church where the Word exists is like the heart and the lungs, and the Lord's Church where it does not exist is like all the other internal organs which 
get their life from the heart and lungs - see <a href="637.htm">637</a>, <a href="931.htm">931</a>, <a href="2054.htm">2054</a>, <a href="2853.htm">2853</a>. </p>

`Et ivit et reversus Laban ad locum suum': quod significet finem repraesentationis per Labanem, constat a significatione `reverti ad locum suum' quod sit redire ad priorem statum; quod `locus' sit 
status, videatur n. 2625, 2837, 3356, 3387, 3404; inde est quod per illa verba significetur finis repraesentationis per Labanem.  Ex his quae ostensa sunt, constare potest quod omnia et singula in 
Verbo contineant interiora; et quod interiora talia sint, quae adaequata perceptioni angelorum qui apud hominem {1}; ut pro exemplo: cum in Verbo dicitur panis, angeli non sciunt quid panis (o)materialis, 
sed (o)quid panis spiritualis, ita pro pane percipiunt Dominum, (o)Qui quod Panis (x)vitae sit, Ipse docet apud Johannem vi 33, 35, et quia Dominum, percipiunt illa quae a Domino, proinde 
amorem Ipsius erga universum genus humanum, et tunc simul (o)percipiunt amorem reciprocum hominis in Dominum, (o)nam haec in una idea cogitationis et affectionis cohaerent; [2] non absimiliter cogitat 
{2} homo qui in sancto est, cum panem Sacrae Cenae accipit, nam cogitat tunc non de pane, sed de Domino (o)et de Ipsius misericordia, (o)et de illis quae amoris in Ipsum sunt, et charitatis erga 
proximum, quia de paenitentia et emendatione vitae, sed hoc cum varietate secundum sanctitatem in qua est non modo quoad cogitationem, sed etiam quoad affectionem; inde patet quod panis in Verbo 
non sistat ideam alicujus panis apud angelos sed sistat ideam amoris, cum innumerabilibus quae amoris sunt; </p>
<p>similiter vinum cum hoc in Verbo legitur, et quoque in Sacra Cena accipitur, tunc angeli 
nihil cogitant de vino sed de charitate erga proximum; et quia ita, et inde nexus hominis cum caelo et per caelum cum Domino, ideo panis et vinum symbola facta sunt, ac uniunt {3} hominem qui in sancto 
vitae est, cum caelo et per caelum cum Domino: [3] similiter se habet cum singulis quae in Verbo, quapropter Verbum est medium uniens hominis {4} cum Domino, quod nisi {5} medium uniens foret, 
non potuisset caelum influere apud hominem, nam absque medio nulla unitio, sed removeret se ab homine; </p>
<p>quod si removeretur, non `potuisset amplius' aliquis duci ad bonum, ne quidem ad bonum corporeum 
et mundanum, sed vincula omnia, etiam externa, forent rupta; (m)Dominus enim regit hominem qui in bono est, per vincula interna, quae sunt conscientiae, qui autem {6} in malo est, (o)solum per 
vincula externa quibus ruptis(n) unusquisque {7} insaniret, qualiter insanit qui {8} absque timore legis (o)est, absque timore vitae, et (o)absque timore jactura (t)honoris et lucri, (c)ac inde famae 
{9}, haec enim sunt vincula externa sic genus humanum periret: inde {10} constare potest, cur Verbum, e quale Verbum: quod Ecclesia Domini ubi est Verbum, sit instar cordis et instar pulmonum; et 
Ecclesia Domini ubi non est Verbum, sit instar (o)reliquorum viscerum, quae {11} a corde et pulmonibus vivunt, videatur n. 637, 931, 2054, 2853.      @1 et quod res ibi repraesentent illa, et verba 
significent illa; scio, quod pauci credant quod cum Verbo se ita habeat, et quod nec induci possint ad credendum, utcunque ad oculum et ad captum ostenderetur, cum tamen talia in sensu interno Verbi
