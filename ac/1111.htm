<h3 align="center" class="ired">属天的奥秘 第1111节</h3>
<h4 align="center"></h4><p><strong>1111.</strong>有些人在世时过着文明道德的良善生活，确信凭自己的作为配得上天堂，并认为只要承认唯独一位神是宇宙造物主就足够了，在来生，他们的谬念就会转化为这类幻觉：似乎自己正在割草，被叫做割草机。由于感觉寒冷，他们努力割草以取暖。有时候，他们到处请求所遇见的人给与他们一些温暖。的确，这些精灵能够答应他们的要求，但是，他们所得到的温暖毫无作用，因为那是外在的温暖，他们缺乏的是内在的温暖。于是，他们又回去割草，以劳动获取热能。我曾感受过他们的寒冷。他们总是希望被提升进入天堂，时常聚在一起商讨如何凭自己的能力进入那个地方。由于这些人履行有益的工作，所以他们就在那些被消磨的人之列；随着时间流逝，最终，他们被引领进入善的社群，并接受教导。</p>

<p><strong>[NCE]1111.</strong> Some people had lived a life of civic and moral good but had convinced themselves they would earn heaven by their deeds, believing it sufficient to acknowledge the one God as the creator of the universe. In the other life, their false assumptions turn into hallucinations in which they seem to themselves to be mowing grass, and they are called grass cutters. They are cold and do the mowing in an effort to warm up.{*1} Sometimes they wander around asking the people they meet, "Would you lend me some warmth?" Imparting warmth is something that spirits are indeed capable of, but the kind these people receive does nothing for them, because it is superficial, when what they crave is inner heat. So they go back to their mowing and warm themselves by their work. I felt their chill.<br />They are constantly hopeful of being taken up into heaven. Sometimes they seek advice on how to make it there under their own power.<br />Since they did do good deeds, they are among those who undergo devastation, and when their term is completed, they are finally accepted into good communities, where they receive instruction.<br /><br /><strong>Footnotes:</strong><br />{*1} Cutting of grasses, whether hay or grain harvest, takes place in the summer months, and before the machine age, mowing was done with a sickle or a scythe, making it strenuous and heated labor. (The Latin word for "cutters" here [serratores] literally means "sawyers," and may imply the use of a small, serrated sickle; for an illustration, see Hartley 1979, 175, or Sloane 1964, 101.) Swedenborg mentions grass cutters who suffer from chills in Spiritual Experiences (Swedenborg 1998-2002) <a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_1111/swedenborg_spiritual-experiences-odhner_3079" target=_top>3079-3080</a>.

Those who have lived a good civic and moral life, but have persuaded themselves that they merit heaven by their works, and have believed that it is sufficient to acknowledge an only God as the Creator 
of the universe, in the other life have their false principles turned into such phantasies that they seem to themselves to be cutting grass, and are called grass-cutters. They are cold, and try to warm 
themselves by this cutting. Sometimes they go round and inquire among those whom they meet whether they will give them some heat, which indeed spirits can do, but the heat which they receive has no 
effect upon them, because it is external and what they want is internal heat; and therefore they return to their cutting, and thus gain heat by their labor. Their cold I have felt. They are always hoping 
to be taken up into heaven, and sometimes consult together how they may introduce themselves by their own power. As these persons have performed good works, they are among those who are vastated; 
and at length, after some time has passed, they are introduced into good societies, and are instructed. </p>

People who have led a good life, public and private, but who have persuaded themselves that they merit heaven by works and who have believed that it is enough merely to acknowledge one God alone as the 
Creator of the universe, have their false assumptions converted in the next life into such delusions that they seem to themselves to be cutting grass, and are called grass-cutters. They are cold, and 
endeavour to warm themselves by that cutting activity. Sometimes they go around inquiring of those they meet whether they will provide them with some warmth. This the spirits are indeed able to do 
for them, but the warmth they receive has no effect on them because it is external and they are wanting internal warmth. Consequently they return to their cutting, and in this way obtain some warmth for 
themselves from their work. I have felt their cold. They are always hoping that they are going to be carried into heaven. Sometimes they consult about how they can get themselves into that place by 
their own power. Because these people have performed good works they are among those who are vastated; and at length with the passage of time they are admitted into good communities and receive instruction. </p>

</p><b>1111.</b>
Qui vitam civilem et moralem bonam vixerunt, sed sibi persuaserunt per opera mereri caelum, et crediderunt quod satis sit si agnoscant unicum Deum universi creatorem, eorum principia falsi vertuntur 
in altera vita in tales phantasias quod videantur sibi secare gramen, et vocantur 'graminis serratores'; sunt frigidi, et per serrationem istam se calefacere student; quandoque circumeunt et quaerunt 
apud eos quos inveniunt, num quid caloris iis dare velint:  quod etiam spiritus possunt facere, sed calor quem accipiunt, nihil apud eos efficit, quia externus est, volentes habere calorem internum, 
quare redeunt ad serrationes suas, et sic sibi calorem labore acquirunt; frigus eorum sensi:  sperant semper quod in caelum auferendi; quandoque consultant quomodo semet sua potentia queant illuc immittere. 
 Hi quia bona opera praestiterunt, inter eos sunt qui vastantur; et tandem peracto tempore intromittuntur in societates bonas et instruuntur. </p>
