<h3 align="center" class="ired">属天的奥秘 第7964节</h3>
<h4 align="center"></h4><p><strong>7964.</strong>“埃及催促百姓，打发他们快快离开那地”表由于厌恶和惧怕，他们催促他们离开。这从“催促百姓，打发他们快快离开”的含义清楚可知，“催促百姓，打发他们快快离开”是指催促他们离开。是厌恶和惧怕促使他们这样做，这是显而易见的；因为那些沉浸于由邪恶所生的纯粹虚假的人如此厌恶那些处于源于良善的真理之人，以致他们甚至无法忍受他们的同在。这就是为何那些陷入邪恶的人照其邪恶的性质和数量而将自己深深地扔进地狱，以便他们能远离良善。他们不仅出于厌恶，还出于惧怕而这样做，因为在良善面前，他们备受折磨。</p>

<p align="center"><b>Potts(1905-1910) 7964</b></p><p><b>7964.</b>
And Egypt was strong upon the people, hastening to send them out of the land. That this signifies that from aversion and fear they were urgent that they should depart, is evident from the signification 
of "to be strong upon the people, hastening to send them away," as being to be urgent that they should depart. That this was from aversion and fear, is evident; for they who are in mere falsity from 
evil are so averse to those who are in truth from good that they cannot endure even their presence. From this it is that they who are in evil cast themselves deep down into hell according to the nature 
and degree of their evil, in order that they may be far from good; and this not only from aversion, but also from fear, because in the presence of good they are tormented </p>

<p align="center"><b>Elliott(1983-1999) 7964</b></p><p><b>7964.</b>
'And Egypt pressed the people, in a hurry to send them away from the land' means that because of their loathing and fear of them they were urging them to depart. This is clear from the meaning of 'pressing 
the people, in a hurry to send them away' as urging them to depart. The fact that loathing and fear caused them to do so is self-evident, for those steeped in nothing but falsity arising from evil 
so loathe those guided by truth from good that they cannot stand even their presence. This is why those governed by evil cast themselves down into hell, to a depth determined by the nature and amount 
of that evil, to get far away from good. Not only loathing but also fear makes them do it, for in the presence of good they suffer torment. </p>

</p><b>7964.</b>
`Et invaluit Aegyptus super populum, festinando dimittere illos e terra': quod significet quod ex aversatione et timore urgerent ut discederent, constat ex significatione `invalescere super populum 
festinando dimittere illos' quod sit urgere ut discederent; quod ex aversatione et timore, patet, nam qui in mero falso ex malo sunt illos qui in vero {1}ex bono aversantur adeo ut ne quidem praesentiam 
illorum sustinere possint; inde est quod qui in malo sunt se dejiciant in infernum profunde secundum mali quale et quantum ut procul sint a bono, et hoc non solum ex aversatione sed etiam ex timore, 
nam in praesentia boni cruciantur. 	@1 et$ </p>
