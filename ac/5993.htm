<h4 align="center"></h4><p><strong>5993.</strong>由此可见，为与灵界接触，一个人必须有两个来自地狱的灵人，两位来自天堂的天使与他相联；没有他们，此人根本不会有任何生命。事实上，人绝无可能如缺乏理性的动物那样（如前所述<a href="5850.htm">5850</a>节）从普遍流注中获得自己的生命，因为他的整个生命都违反次序。人既处于这种状态，那么若只受普遍流注作用，必然只受地狱作用，不受天堂作用。他若不受天堂作用，就不会有任何内在生命，因而没有诸如人类所拥有的那种思维和意愿的生命，甚至没有诸如一个动物所拥有的那种生命。因为人生来不会运用理性，若不通过来自天堂的流注，就无法被引入理性。<br />综上所述，也可以清楚看出，一个人若不通过来自地狱的灵人与地狱交流，就无法存活，因为他通过遗传从父母所获得的整个生命，以及他从自己的东西中所添加的一切，都是由爱自己爱世界，而不是爱邻，更不是爱神构成的。人从他自己的东西所获得的整个生命都是由爱自己爱世界构成的，相应地是由与自己相比对他人的蔑视，以及对凡不偏向他之人的仇恨和报复构成，故而也由残忍构成；因为凡对他人心怀仇恨的人都想杀害他们，以毁灭他人为最大快乐。像这样的灵人不可能来自其它任何地方，只能来自地狱。除非这些灵人粘附于这些邪恶，除非一个人照他生命的快乐被他们引导，否则，他绝无可能被转向天堂。一开始，他的实际快乐本身被用来转移他；这些快乐也被用来将他置于自由的状态，从而最终赋予他选择的权力。</p>

From all this it is now evident that for a man to have communication with the spiritual world there must be joined to him two spirits from hell and two angels from heaven, and that without these he would 
have no life whatever. For a man cannot possibly live from general influx, as do animals void of reason (of which n. 5850), because his whole life is contrary to order; and being in this state, if 
a man were acted on by general influx only, he would necessarily be acted on by the hells only, and not from the heavens; and if he were not acted on from the heavens he would have no interior life, 
thus no life of thought and will such as is proper to man, and not even such as is proper to a brute animal, because a man is born without any use of reason, and can be initiated into it solely through 
influx from the heavens. [2] From all that has been advanced it is also evident that a man cannot live without communication with the hells through spirits from them, for the whole of his life which 
he derives from his parents by inheritance, and all that he himself adds from his own, is of the love of self and of the world, and not of the love of the neighbor, and still less of love to God. And 
as the whole of man's life from his own is of the love of self and of the world, it is therefore a life of contempt for others in comparison with self, and of hatred and revenge against all who do 
not favor self. Thus it is also a life of cruelty; for he who hates, desires to kill, and is therefore most highly delighted with the destruction of others. Unless spirits of a like nature were applied 
to these evils (and such spirits must be from hell), and unless the man were led by them in accordance with the delights of his life, he could not possibly be bent toward heaven. At first he is bent 
by means of his delights themselves; and by these is also set in freedom, thus at last in the faculty of exercising choice.            Genesis 46 </p>
<p>     1. And Israel journeyed, and all that he had, 
and came to Beersheba, and sacrificed sacrifices to the God of his father Isaac.      2. And God said to Israel in the visions of the night, and He said, Jacob, Jacob. And he said, Behold me.    
  3. And He said, I am God; the God of thy father; fear not to go down into Egypt, for I will there make of thee a great nation.      4. I will go down with thee into Egypt; and I will cause thee to 
go up, even in going up; and Joseph shall put his hand upon thine eyes.      5. And Jacob rose up from Beersheba; and the sons of Israel carried Jacob their father, and their babes, and their women, 
in the carts which Pharaoh had sent to carry him.      6. And they took their cattle, and their acquisition which they had acquired in the land of Canaan, and came into Egypt, Jacob, and all his seed 
with him: </p>
<p>     7. His sons, and his sons' sons with him, his daughters, and his sons' daughters, and all his seed, brought he with him into Egypt.      8. And these are the names of the sons of Israel, 
who came into Egypt, of Jacob and of his sons: Reuben, Jacob's firstborn. 9. And the sons of Reuben: Hanoch, and Pallu, and Hezron, and Carmi.      10. And the sons of Simeon: Jemuel, and Jamin, 
and Ohad, and Jachin, and Zohar, and Shaul the son of a Canaanitish woman.      11. And the sons of Levi: Gershon, and Kohath, and Merari.      12. And the sons of Judah: Er, and Onan, and Shelah, 
and Perez, and Zerah; but Er and Onan died in the land of Canaan. And the sons of Perez were Hezron and Hamul.      13. And the sons of Issachar: Tola, and Puvah, and Iob, and Shimron.      14. And 
the sons of Zebulun: Sered, and Elon, and Jahleel.      15. These are the sons of Leah, whom she bare unto Jacob in Paddan-aram, and his daughter Dinah; all the souls of his sons and of his daughters 
were thirty and three.      16. And the sons of Gad: Ziphion, and Haggi, Shuni, and Ezbon, Eri, and Arodi, and Areli.      17. And the sons of Asher: Imnah, and Ishvah, and Ishvi, and Beriah, and 
Serah their sister; and the sons of Beriah: Ber, and Malchiel.      18. These are the sons of Zilpah, whom Laban gave to Leah his daughter, and these she bare to Jacob: sixteen souls.      19. The sons 
of Rachel, Jacob's wife: Joseph and Benjamin.      20. And to Joseph were born in the land of Egypt, whom Asenath the daughter of Potiphera priest of On bare unto him, Manasseh and Ephraim.     
 21. And the sons of Benjamin: Bela, and Becher, and Ashbel, Gera, and Naaman, Ehi, and Rosh, Muppim, and Huppim, and Ard.      22. These are the sons of Rachel, who were born to Jacob: all the souls 
were fourteen.      23. And the sons of Dan: Hushim.      24. And the sons of Naphtali: Jahzeel, and Guni, and Jezer, and Shillem.      25. These are the sons of Bilhah, whom Laban gave unto Rachel 
his daughter, and these she bare to Jacob; all the souls were seven.      26. All the souls that came with Jacob into Egypt, that came out of his thigh, besides Jacob's sons' women, all the souls were 
sixty and six.      27. And the sons of Joseph, who were born to him in Egypt, were two souls. All the souls of the house of Jacob, that came into Egypt, were seventy.      28. And he sent Judah 
before him unto Joseph, to show before him unto Goshen; and they came into the land of Goshen.      29. And Joseph harnessed his chariot, and went up to meet Israel his father, to Goshen; and he was 
seen of him, and fell upon his necks, and wept upon his necks a long while.      30. And Israel said unto Joseph, Let me die, after that I have seen thy faces, that thou art yet alive.      31. And 
Joseph said unto his brethren, and unto his father's house, I will go up, and will tell Pharaoh, and will say unto him, My brethren, and my father's house, who were in the land of Canaan, are come unto 
me; </p>
<p>     32. And the men are shepherds of the flock, for they are men of cattle; and they have brought their flocks, and their herds, and all that they have.      33. And it may be that Pharaoh will 
call you, and will say, What are your works?      34. And ye shall say, Thy servants have been men of cattle from their youth even until now, both we, and our fathers; in order that ye may dwell 
in the land of Goshen; for every shepherd of the flock is an abomination of the Egyptians. </p>

From all that has now been said it may be seen that to be in touch with the spiritual world a person must have two spirits from hell and two angels from heaven linked to him, and that without them he 
would not have any life at all. For the human being cannot by any means receive his life from general influx, like living creatures devoid of reason, which are dealt with in <a href="5850.htm">5850</a>, because his entire 
life is contrary to order. That being his state, if he were moved by general influx alone he would be moved inevitably by hell, not by heaven. And if not moved by heaven he would not have any interior 
life, nor thus any thought or will at all such as a human being possesses, not even any such as an animal possesses. For the human being is born without any use of reason and cannot be led into it except 
through influx from heaven. </p>
<p></p>
<p><b>[2]</b>
 From what has been brought forward here it is also clear that a person cannot live without communication with the hells through spirits from there, for his entire 
life which he derives by heredity from his parents, and all that he adds of what is his own, consists of self-love and love of the world, not of love of the neighbour, still less of love of God. And 
because a person's entire life from what is properly his own consists of self-love and love of the world, it accordingly consists of contempt for others in comparison with self and of hatred felt for 
and revenge taken on all who do not show him favour. It therefore consists too of cruelty, for anyone harbouring hatred of others wishes to kill them, and is supremely delighted by the ruination of 
them. Unless spirits like this, who cannot come from anywhere but hell, were attached to those evils, and unless a person were led by those spirits in ways that accord with the delights of his life, he 
could not possibly be diverted towards heaven, for initially those actual delights of his are used to divert him. They are also used to place him in a state of freedom, thus finally to give him the 
power of choice. </p>

Ex his nunc constare potest quod, ut communicatio homini sit cum mundo spirituali, ei adjuncti erunt bini spiritus ab inferno et bini angeli e caelo, et quod absque illis prorsus nulla ei vita foret; 
homo enim nequaquam vivere potest ex influxu communi, sicut animalia rationis expertia, de quibus n. 5850, ex causa quia omnis vita ejus est contra ordinem; si is quia in illo statu, ageretur a solo

Joseph currum suum, et ascendit obviam Israeli patri suo Goshenem; et visus ad illum, et cecidit super colla ejus, et flevit super collis ejus diu. 30.  Et dixit Israel ad Josephum, Moriar hac vice, 
postquam vidi facies tuas, quod adhuc tu vivas. 31.  Et dixit Joseph ad fratres suos, et ad domum patris sui, Ascendam et indicabo Pharaoni, et dicam ad illum, Fratres mei et domus patris mei, qui 
in terra Canaan, venerunt ad me. 32.  Et viri pastores gregis, quia viri pecoris sunt; et greges suos et armenta sua, et omnia quae illis, venire fecerunt. 33.  Et sit quod vocet vos Pharaoh et dicat, 
Quid opera vestra?   34.  Et dicatis, Viri pecoris fuerunt servi tui a pueritiis suis, et usque ad nunc, etiam nos etiam patres nostri; propterea ut habitetis in terra Goshen; quia abominatio Aegyptiorum
