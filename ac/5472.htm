<h3 align="center" class="ired">属天的奥秘 第5472节</h3>
<h4 align="center"></h4><p><strong>5472.</strong>“流便回答他们说”表仍源于教义和理解力中的信的觉知。这从“回答”或“说”和“流便”的代表清楚可知：“回答”他的兄弟或对他们“说”是指觉知，因为“说”是指觉知（参看<a href="5468.htm">5468</a>节）；“流便”是指教义和理解力中的信，或藉以能获得生活良善的教义真理（参看<a href="3861.htm">3861</a>，<a href="3866.htm">3866</a>节）。由于此处论述的主题是良善，或良善里面的神性所作的被接受的恳求，所以提到了信和它教导有关接受良善的方式。因为当人背离良善时，如果他感觉有所焦虑不安，这不是由于向他说话的一种内在声音，而是由于他自童年早期所获得的信仰。这就是在这种时候向他说话，并造成这种焦虑不安的。这解释了为何代表这信的流便在此说话。教义和理解力中的信这种叫法将这信与“西缅”所代表的生活和意愿中的信区别开来。</p>

<p align="center"><b>Potts(1905-1910) 5472</b></p><p><b>5472.</b>
And Reuben answered them, saying. That this signifies perception still from faith in doctrine and in the understanding, is evident from the signification of "answering" or "saying" to his brethren, as 
being perception (that "saying" denotes perception may be seen above, n. 5468); and from the representation of Reuben, as being faith in doctrine and in the understanding, or the truth of doctrine through 
which the good of life can be attained (see n. 3861, 3866). As the subject here treated of is the entreaty of good, or of the Divine in good, to be received, mention is made of faith, and the way 
in which it teaches concerning the reception of good; for if when a man recedes from good he feels any anxiety, this is not from any innate dictate, but from the faith he has acquired from infancy, 
and which then dictates and causes this anxiety. This is the reason why Reuben, by whom this faith is represented, here speaks. It is called faith in doctrine and in the understanding, to distinguish 
it from faith in life and in the will, which faith is represented by Simeon. </p>

<p align="center"><b>Elliott(1983-1999) 5472</b></p><p><b>5472.</b>
'And Reuben answered them, saying' means that a perception nevertheless existed, springing from faith in doctrine and in the understanding. This is clear from the meaning of 'answering' or 'saying to 
his brothers' as perception, for 'saying' is perception, see above in <a href="5468.htm">5468</a>; and from the representation of 'Reuben' as faith in doctrine and in the understanding, which is the truth of doctrine by means 
of which one can arrive at the good of life, dealt with in <a href="3861.htm">3861</a>, <a href="3866.htm">3866</a>. Since the subject here is the entreaty made by good, or the Divine within good, to be accepted, reference is made to faith - 
to the kinds of things taught by this regarding the acceptance of good. For if a person departing from good feels at all disturbed, this is not due to an inner voice speaking to him but to the faith acquired 
by him since early childhood. This is what speaks to him at such times and gives rise to the disturbance felt by him. This explains why Reuben, who represents that faith, is the speaker here. 
The expression faith in doctrine and in the understanding is used to distinguish that faith from faith in life and in the will, which 'Simeon' represents. </p>

{1}`Et respondit Reuben illis, dicendo': quod significet usque perceptionem ex fide doctrina et intellectu, constat (c)ex significatione `respondere' seu `dicere ad fratres suos' quod sit perceptio; 
quod `dicere' sit perceptio, videatur supra n. 5468; et ex repraesentatione `Reubenis' quod sit fides doctrina et intellectu, seu verum doctrinae per quod ad bonum vitae perveniri possit, de qua n. 3861, 
3866. Hic quia agitur de sollicitatione boni, seu Divini in bono, ut recipiatur, memoratur de fide qualiter illa de receptione boni docet; homo enim quando recedit a bono, cum sentit aliquid anxii, 
non est ex aliquo dictamine innato sed est ex fide quam ab infantia hauserat, {2}haec dictat tunc et facit id anxium; haec causa est quod Reuben per quem fides illa repraesentatur, hic loquatur.  Dicitur 
fides doctrina et intellectu, ut distinguatur a fide vita et voluntate, quae fides (t)per Shimeonem repraesentatur. @1 See p. 169, ft 1$ @2 hoc I$ </p>
