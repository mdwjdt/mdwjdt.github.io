<h3 align="center" class="ired">属天的奥秘 第4241节</h3>
<h4 align="center"></h4><p><strong>4241.</strong>“就是以东的田野”表源于此，也就是源于良善的真理。这从“以东的田野”的含义清楚可知，“以东的田野”是指主的神性属世层的良善，该良善与真理的教义或真理相结合（参看<a href="3302.htm">3302</a>，<a href="3322.htm">3322</a>节）。源于此，也就是源于良善的真理与作为良善源头的真理迥然不同。作为良善源头的真理是指人在重生之前为自己所取得的真理，而源于良善的真理则是他在重生之后为自己所取得的真理。重生之后，真理就从良善发出，因为那时此人出于良善觉察并知道它们是真理。这种真理，就是从良善发出的真理，就是“以东的田野”所表示的；如上面从士师记所引用的经文：<br />耶和华啊，你从西珥出来，由以东田野行走。（士师记<a href="http://39-27.cn/士5.4.htm">5:4</a>）</p>

The field of Edom. That this signifies the derivative truth (that is, truth from good) is evident from the signification of the "field of Edom," as being the Lord's Divine natural as to good, with which 
are conjoined the doctrinal things of truth, or truths (see n. 3302, 3322). The "derivative truths," or those which are from good, are distinct from the truths from which is good. The truths from 
which is good are those with which man imbues himself before regeneration; but the truths which are from good are those with which he imbues himself after regeneration, for after regeneration truths proceed 
from good, because the man then perceives and knows from good that they are true. Such truth, thus the truth of good, is what is signified by the "field of Edom;" as also in the passage cited above 
from the book of Judges: "O Jehovah, when Thou wentest forth out of Seir, when thou marchedst out of the field of Edom" (Judg. 5:4).  </p>

<p align="center"><b>Elliott(1983-1999) 4241</b></p><p><b>4241.</b>
'The field of Edom' means truth derived from this, that is to say, from good. This is clear from the meaning of 'the field of Edom' as the Lord's Divine Natural as regards good to which truths, or matters 
of doctrine regarding truth, were joined, dealt with in <a href="3302.htm">3302</a>, <a href="3322.htm">3322</a>. Truths derived from this, that is, from good, are quite different from truths which are the source of good. Truths which are the 
source of good are those which a person takes to himself before regeneration, whereas truths which are derived from good are those which he takes to himself after regeneration. For after regeneration 
truths are the product of good </p>
<p>since good is now the source of his perception and knowledge that they are truths. Such truth - truth which is the product of good - is that which is meant by 'the 
field of Edom', as also in the place quoted above from the Book of Judges, </p>
<blockquote>
O Jehovah, when You went forth from Seir, when You set out from the field of Edom. <a href="http://bible.gospelcom.net/cgi-bin/bible?passage=Judg%205:4&amp;version=ESV&amp;interface=print&amp;showfn=yes&amp;showxref">Judg 5:4</a>. 
</blockquote>

</p><b>4241.</b>
`Agrum Edomi':  quod significet verum inde, nempe ex bono, constat (c)ex significatione `agri Edomi' quod sit Divinum Naturale Domini quoad bonum, cui conjuncta doctrinalia veri, seu vera, de qua 
n. 3302, 3322; vera inde seu quae ex bono, distincta sunt a veris ex quibus bonum; vera ex quibus bonum, sunt illa quae homo imbuit ante regenerationem, vera autem quae ex bono, sunt illa quae imbuit 
post regenerationem; post regenerationem enim ex bono procedunt vera, nam ex bono tunc percipit (c)et novit quod vera sint; (t)de verum, ita verum boni, est quod significatur per `agrum Edomi'; 
similiter etiam in loco supra allato ex Libro Judicum,      [3] Jehovah cum exivisti e {1} Seir, cum egressus es ex agro Edomi, v 4. </p>
