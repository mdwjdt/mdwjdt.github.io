<p>     Genesis 50 </p>
<p>     1. And Joseph fell upon the faces of his father, and wept upon him, and kissed him.      2. And Joseph 
commanded his servants the physicians to embalm his father; and the physicians embalmed Israel.      3. And forty days were fulfilled for him; for so are fulfilled the days of the embalmed; and 
the Egyptians wept for him seventy days.      4. And the days of weeping for him passed away, and Joseph spake unto the house of Pharaoh, saying, If I pray I have found grace in your eyes, speak I pray 
in the ears of Pharaoh, saying,      5. My father made me swear, saying, Lo, I die: in my sepulcher which I have digged for me in the land of Canaan, there shalt thou bury me. And now I pray let me 
go up, and bury my father, and I will return.      6. And Pharaoh said, Go up, and bury thy father, according as he made thee swear.      7. And Joseph went up to bury his father; and with him went 
up all the servants of Pharaoh, the elders of his house, and all the elders of the land of Egypt,      8. And all the house of Joseph, and his brethren, and his father's house: only their babes, and 
their flocks, and their herds, they left in the land of Goshen.      9. And there went up with him both chariots and horsemen; and the army was exceeding great.      10. And they came to the threshing-floor 
Atad, which is in the passage of the Jordan, and they wailed there a very great and grievous wailing; and he made a mourning for his father seven days.      11. And the inhabitant of the land, 
the Canaanite, saw the mourning in the threshing-floor Atad, and they said, This is a grievous mourning to the Egyptians; wherefore they called the name of it Abel-mizraim, which is in the passage 
of the Jordan.      12. And his sons did unto him as he had commanded them: </p>
<p>     13. And his sons carried him into the land of Canaan, and buried him in the cave of the field of Machpelah, which Abraham 
bought with the field for a possession of a sepulcher, from Ephron the Hittite, upon the faces of Mamre.      14. And Joseph returned into Egypt, he and his brethren, and all that went up with 
him to bury his father, after he had buried his father.      15. And Joseph's brethren saw that their father was dead, and they said, Peradventure Joseph will hate us, and returning will return unto 
us all the evil that we requited to him.      16. And they commanded Joseph, saying, Thy father did command before he died, saying,      17. Thus shall ye say unto Joseph, I pray forgive I pray the 
transgression of thy brethren, and their sin, because they requited evil to thee; and now forgive I pray the transgression of the servants of the God of thy father. And Joseph wept when they spake unto 
him.      18. And his brethren also went and fell down before him; and they said, Behold we are thy servants.      19. And Joseph said unto them, Fear ye not; for am I in God's stead?      20. And 
you thought evil against me, but God thought it for good, in order to do as it is this day, to keep alive a great people.      21. And now fear ye not: I will sustain you, and your babes. And he comforted 
them, and spake upon their heart.      22. And Joseph dwelt in Egypt, he and his father's house; and Joseph lived a hundred and ten years.      23. And Joseph saw Ephraim's sons of the third 
generation: the sons also of Machir the son of Manasseh were born upon Joseph's knees.      24. And Joseph said unto his brethren, I die; and visiting God will visit you, and will make you go up out 
of this land unto the land which He sware to Abraham, to Isaac, and to Jacob.      25. And Joseph took an oath of the sons of Israel, saying, Visiting God will visit you, and ye shall make my bones 
go up from hence.      26. And Joseph died, a son of a hundred and ten years; and they embalmed him, and he was put in an ark in Egypt. </p>

<p>GENESEOS CAPUT QUINQUAGESIMUM 1.  Et cecidit Joseph super facies patris sui, et fievit super illo, et osculatus illum. 2.  Et praecepit Joseph servis suis 
medicis ad condiendum patrem suum; et condierunt medici Israelem. 3.  Et impleti ei quadraginto dies, quia ita implentur dies conditorum; et fleverunt illum Aegyptii Septuaginta dies. 4.  Et transiverunt 
dies fletus ejus, et locutus Joseph ad domum Pharaonis, dicendo, si quaeso inveni gratiam in oculis vestris, loquimini quaeso in auribus Pharaonis, dicendo. 5.  Pater meus adjuravit me, dicendo, 
Ecce ego morior, in sepulcro meo, quod fodi mihi in terra Canaan, ibi sepelias me; et nunc asendam quaeso, et sepelium patrem meum, et revertar. 6.  Et dixit Pharaoh, Ascende et sepeli patrem tuum, 
quemadmodum adjuravit te. 7.  Et ascendit Joseph ad sepeliendum patrem suum, et ascenderunt cum eo omnes servi Pharaonis, seniores domus ejus et omnes seniores terrae Aegypti. 8.  Et tota domus 
Josephi, et fratres ejus, et domus patris sui; tantum infantes suos, et greges suos, et armenta sua, reliquerunt in terra Goshen. 9.  Et ascendit cum eo tetiam currus, etiam equites, et erat exercitus 
gravis valde. 10.  Et venerunt ad aream Atad, quae in transitu Jordanis, et planxerunt ibi planctum magnum et gravem valde, et fecit patri suo luctum septem dies. 11.  Et vidit habitator terrae Cananaeus 
luctum in area Atad, et dixerunt, Luctus gravis hic Aegyptiis, propterea vocavit nomen ejus Abel Mizraim qui in transitu Jordanis. 12.  Et fecerunt filii ejus ita, quemadmodum, praeceperat illis. 
 13.  Et tulerunt illum filii ejus terram Canaanem, et sepeliverunt illum in spelunca agri Machpelah, quam emerat Abraham cum agro ad possessionem sepulcri ex Ephrone Hittaeo, super facies Mamre. 
  14.  Et reversus Joseph Aegyptum, is et fratres ejus, et omnes ascendentes cum eo ad sepeliendum patrem ejus, postquam sepelire eum patrem suum. 15.  Et viderunt fratres Josephi quod mortuus pater 
illorum, et dixerunt, Fortassis odio habebit nos Joseph, et reducendo reducet nobis omne malum quod retribuimus illi. 16.  Et praeceperunt ad Josephum, dicendo, Pater tuus praecepit ante mori eum, 
dicendo. 17.  Ita dicatis ad Josephum, Quaeso remitte quaeso praevaricationem fratrum tuorum, et peccatum illorum, quia malum retribuerunt tibi; et nunc remitte quaeso praevaricationem servorum DEI 
patris tui; et flevit Joseph in loqui illos ad eum.  18.  Et iverunt etiam fratres ejus, et ceciderunt coram eo, et dixerunt, Ecce nos tibi ad servos. 19.  Et dixit ad illos Joseph, Ne timeatis, quia 
num pro DEO ego? 20.  Et vos cogitastis super me malum, DEUS cogitavit id ad bonum propter facere secundum diem hunc, ad vivificandum populum magnum. 21.  Et nunc ne timeatis, ego sustentabo vos, 
et infantes vestros; et consolatus illos, et locutus super cor illorum. 22.  Et habitavit Joseph in Aegypto, is et domus patris ejus; et vixit Joseph centum et decem annos. 23.  Et vidit Joseph Ephraimo 
filios tertianorum; etiam filii Machir, filii Menashis nati super genubus Josephi. 24.  Et dixit Joseph ad fratres suos, Ego morior, et DEUS visitando visitabit vos, et ascendere faciet vos e terra 
hac ad terram quam juravit Abrahamo, Jishako et Jacobo. 25.  Et adjuravit Joseph filios Israelis, dicendo, Visitando visitabit DEUS vos, et ascendere facietis ossa mea exhinc. 26.  Et moriebatur 
Joseph filius centum et decem annorum; et condierunt eum; et ponebatur in arca in Aegypto. </p>
