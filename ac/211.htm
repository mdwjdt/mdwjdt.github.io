And the eyes of both were opened and they realized that they were naked.<br />Their eyes were opened means that an inner voice caused them to realize and admit that they were naked, in other words, that they now lived in evil and no longer in the innocence they had had before. </p>
<p align="center"><b>Potts(1905-1910) 211</b></p><p><b>211.</b>
Verse 7. And the eyes of them both were opened, and they knew that they were naked. Their "eyes being opened" signifies their knowing and acknowledging, from an interior dictate, that they were "naked" 
that is, no longer in innocence, as before, but in evil. </p>

Verse 7 And the eyes of both of them were opened, and they knew that they were naked.  </p>
<p>'Their eyes were opened' means that from an inner dictate they knew and acknowledged that they were naked, that 
is, that they no longer dwelt in innocence, as previously, but were under the influence of evil.  </p>

<p align="center"><b>Latin(1748-1756) 211</b>
</p><b>211.</b>
Vers. 7.  Et aperti sunt oculi amborum, et cognoverunt quod nudi ii. 'Quod aperti sint oculi' significat quod ex dictamine interiore cognoverint et agnoverint quod 'nudi,' hoc est, quod non amplius 
in innocentia ut prius, sed in malo. </p>
