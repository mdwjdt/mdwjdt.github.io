<h3 align="center" class="ired">属天的奥秘 第5382节</h3>
<h4 align="center"></h4><p><strong>5382.</strong>我从经历常常发现，那些构成肾脏和输尿管区域的人随时准备着仔细检查或探究别人的秉性，即他们的所想所愿。他们渴望找出这些人有这种想法和愿望的理由，唤起别人对过犯的负疚感，主要是为了能惩戒他们；我曾与这类灵人谈论过这种渴望和意图。这类灵人当中有许多人在世时曾是法官，那时当他们发现他们以之为正当的罚款、纠正或惩罚的理由时，就会发自内心感到欢喜。这类灵人的工作感觉在人的后背，就是肾脏、输尿管和膀胱所在的地方。那些属于膀胱的人向下延伸到火坑，其中一些人坐在那里就像坐在法庭上。</p>

<p align="center"><b>Potts(1905-1910) 5382</b></p><p><b>5382.</b>
I have often observed that they who constitute the province of the kidneys and ureters are quick to explore or search out the quality of others-what they think and what they will-and that they are in 
the cupidity of finding occasions, and making out others to be guilty of some fault, chiefly in order to be able to chastise them, and I have talked with them about this cupidity and this intention. 
Many of this kind in the world had been judges, who rejoiced at heart when they found an occasion which they believed just, to fine, chastise, and punish. The operation of such is felt in the region at 
the back where are the kidneys, ureters, and bladder. They who belong to the bladder stretch out toward gehenna, where some of them sit as it were in judgment. </p>

<p align="center"><b>Elliott(1983-1999) 5382</b></p><p><b>5382.</b>
I have learned from experience on many occasions that those who constitute the province of the kidneys and ureters are ready to explore and examine closely other people's characters to discover what 
their thoughts are and what their wishes are. They desire to find out the reasons why those people think and wish the way they do and to arouse a sense of guilt over any faults these may have, their primary 
purpose being to administer correction; and I have talked to such spirits about this desire and purpose of theirs. Many of their kind were judges when they lived in the world, at which time they 
felt glad at heart when they found the reason which, they believed, justly warranted the imposition of a fine, correction, or punishment. The work of such spirits is also felt in the region of one's 
back, where the kidneys, ureters, and bladder are situated. Those who belong to the bladder extend down towards Gehenna, where also some of them sit like a court of law. </p>

</p><b>5382.</b>
Quod qui renum et ureterum provinciam constituunt, praesto sint ad explorandum seu scrutandum quales alii sunt, quid cogitant et quid volunt, et quod in cupiditate sint inveniendi causas et reos alicujus 
culpae faciendi, ob finem imprimis ut castigare queant, multoties expertus sum, ac de cupiditate illa et fine illo cum illis locutus; plures illius generis in mundo cum ibi vixerunt, fuerant judices, 
et tunc gavisi ex corde cum invenerint causam quam crediderant justam, mulctandi, castigandi, puniendique.  Operatio {1} talium appercipitur in regione ad tergum ubi renes, ureteres et vesica; qui 
ad vesicam pertinent, se extendunt versus gehennam, ubi etiam aliqui eorum sedent quasi judicium. </p>
