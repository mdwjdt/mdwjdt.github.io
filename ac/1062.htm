<h3 align="center" class="ired">属天的奥秘 第1062节</h3>
<h4 align="center"></h4><p><strong>1062.</strong>“闪”表内在教会，“含”表败坏的教会，“雅弗”表外在教会。这一点也可从下文清楚看出来，因为下文描述了他们的各自性质。和每个教会一样，古教会既包括内在人，内在败坏的人，也包括外在人。内在人就是那些把仁当成信的主要原则之人；内在败坏的人是那些把无仁之信当成信的主要原则之人；而外在人则是那些很少思想内在人，但仍能行出仁爱行为，虔诚遵守教会仪式之人。除了这三种人外，再没有要被称为属灵教会成员的其他人了。由于他们全都是教会成员，故经上说他们“出方舟”。在古教会，那些系内在人，也就是把仁当成信的主要原则之人被称为“闪”；那些内在败坏、把无仁之信当成主要原则之人被称“含”；而那些系外在，很少思想内在人，但仍行出仁爱行为，虔诚遵守教会仪式之人则被称为“雅弗”。下文将阐述他们的各自性质。</p>

<p><strong>[NCE]1062.</strong> The symbolism of Shem as the inner church, Ham as the church corrupted, and Japheth as the outer church can also be seen from what follows, since their natures will be described.<br />The situation that exists in every religion existed in the ancient church too: there were people who had depth, there were degraded people who had depth, and there were shallow people.<br />People with depth are those who consider charity the most important element of faith. People who have depth but are degraded are those who consider faith without charity the most important aspect of belief. Shallow people are those who do not often think about the inner self but still perform deeds of charity and reverently celebrate the church's rites.<br />Aside from these three types of people, there are none who can be called part of a spiritual church. And since they were all part of the church, they are said to have come out of the ark.<br />Those in the ancient church who had depth — who considered love for others the principal concern of faith, in other words — were called Shem. Those in the ancient church who had depth but were degraded — who considered faith's chief concern to be faith devoid of charity — were referred to as Ham. Those in the ancient church who were shallow and thought little about the inner self but still did the work of charity and reverently celebrated the church's rites were given the name of Japheth.{*1} What each kind was like is dealt with below [<a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_1062/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_1075" target=_top>1075-1103</a>].<br /><br /><strong>Footnotes:</strong><br />{*1} The Christianity of Swedenborg's day and even later viewed Genesis as historical fact and the genealogies of Noah's sons as containing important ethnographic information. Roughly, Shem was regarded as the ancestor of the Semitic peoples (hence their name); Japheth, of the Indo-Europeans; Ham, of the Africans. (See <a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_1062/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_1163" target=_top>1163</a> for instances in which Swedenborg assumes these national attributions as part of his own discourse.) Swedenborg's perspective here, that the sons of Noah and their descendants represent types of worship and indeed types of orientation toward spiritual realities, was thus an unusual and innovative one.

That "Shem" signifies the internal church, "Ham" the church corrupted, and "Japheth" the external church, is also evident from what follows, where their quality is described. As in every church, so in 
the Ancient there were men who were internal, men who were internal and corrupted, and men who were external. Those who are internal are those who make charity the principal* of their faith; those who 
are internal and corrupted make faith without charity the principal of their faith; and those who are external think little about the internal man, but still perform works of charity and sacredly observe 
the rites of the church. Besides these three kinds of men there are no others who are to be called men of the spiritual church; and because they were all men of the church, they are said to have 
"gone forth from the ark." Those in the Ancient Church who were internal men, that is, who made charity the principal of their faith, were called "Shem"; those who were internal and corrupted, who made 
faith without charity the principal, were called "Ham"; while those who were external and thought little about the internal man, but still performed works of charity and sacredly observed the rites 
of the church, were called "Japheth." The nature of each will be seen from the particulars in what follows. * As distinguished from the instrumental. [Reviser] </p>

That 'Shem' means the internal Church, 'Ham' the corrupted Church, 'Japheth' the external Church, is also clear from what follows, for the nature of each one is described. As with every other Church, 
the Ancient Church included people who were internal, people who were internal but corrupted, and people who were external. Internal people are those who make charity the chief thing of faith. Corrupted 
internal people are those who make faith devoid of charity the chief thing of faith. And external people are those who give little thought to the internal man but who nevertheless perform charitable 
works and reverently keep up the religious observances of the Church. Apart from these three kinds of people no others exist who are to be called members of the spiritual Church. And since they were 
all members of the Church they are referred to as those who 'went out of the ark'. Those in the Ancient Church who were internal people, that is, who made charity the chief thing of faith, were called 
Shem; those in it who were internal but corrupt - namely those who made faith devoid of charity the chief thing of faith - were in the Ancient Church called Ham; while those in that Church who were 
external and gave little thought to the internal man but who nevertheless performed charitable works and reverently kept up the religious observances of the Church were named Japheth. The nature of each 
one is dealt with in what follows. </p>

Quod 'Shem' significet Ecclesiam internam, 'Ham' Ecclesiam corruptam, 'Japheth' Ecclesiam externam, etiam a sequentibus constat, nam describuntur quales sunt. Sicut in omni Ecclesia, ita fuit in Antiqua, 
nempe quod fuerint qui interni homines, qui corrupti interni, et qui externi: qui interni, sunt qui principale fidei faciunt charitatem; qui corrupti interni, sunt qui principale fidei faciunt fidem 
absque charitate; et qui externi, sunt qui de interno homine parum cogitant, sed usque opera charitatis praestant et ritu Ecclesiae sancte observant: praeter haec tria genera hominum non dantur alii 
qui dicendi homines Ecclesiae spiritualis; et quia homines Ecclesiae fuerunt omnes, dicuntur 'egressi arca.' Qui interni homines fuerunt in Ecclesia Antiqua, hoc est, qui principale fidei fecerunt 
charitatem, dicti fuerunt 'Shem'; at qui corrupti interni fuerunt, qui nempe principale fidei fecerunt fidem absque charitate, in Ecclesia Antiqua, vocati sunt 'Ham'; at qui externi fuerunt et de interno 
homine parum cogitarunt, sed usque opera charitatis praestiterunt et ritus Ecclesiae sancte observarunt, in Ecclesia Antiqua, appellati sunt 'Japheth': de singulis quales fuerunt, agitur in sequentibus. </p>
