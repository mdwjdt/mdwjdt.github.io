<h3 align="center" class="ired">属天的奥秘 第4057节</h3>
<h4 align="center"></h4><p><strong>4057.</strong>前面解释了世代的终结或最后的审判是什么，就是教会的末期。仁与信在教会不复存在之时就被称作教会的末期。前面也早已说明，这样的终结或末期曾发生过数次。第一代教会的完结以大洪水来描述；第二代教会的完结以迦南地各民族的灭亡，以及先知书频繁提到的灭亡和剪除来描述。第三代教会的完结没有在圣言中被描述，只是被预言了，就是耶路撒冷的毁灭和犹太民族分散到全世界，教会存在于犹太民族当中。世代的第四个终结就是当前教会的完结，主在福音书和约翰所写启示录预言了*即将来临的这第四次完结。<br />*“即将来临”这句话是在1752年说的，当时距对教会的最后审判还有五年。</p>

What the consummation of the age, or Last Judgment is, has already been explained, namely, that it is the last period of the Church. Its last period is said to be when there is no longer in it any charity 
and faith; and it has also been shown that there have been several such consummations, or last periods. The consummation of the first church was described by the flood; and the consummation of the 
second church by the extirpation of the nations in the land of Canaan, and also by the extirpations and cuttings off frequently described in the Prophets. The consummation of the third church is not 
described in the Word, but is foretold-that is, the destruction of Jerusalem, and the dispersion of the Jewish nation, with which was the church, over the whole world. The fourth consummation is that 
of the present Christian church, which is foretold by the Lord in the Evangelists, and also by John in Revelation, and which is now at hand.* * This statement was published in the year 1752, five years 
before the Last Judgement on the Church in question. [REVISER.] </p>

What the Close of the Age or the Last Judgement is has been explained already, namely the final period of the Church. It is called the final period of it when no charity or faith exists there any longer. 
It has also been shown already that such closes or final periods have been reached on several occasions. The close of the first Church has been described by the Flood; the close of the second Church 
by the uprooting of the nations in the land of Canaan, and also by the many uprootings and exterminations referred to in the Prophets. The close of the third is not described in the Word, but is foretold; 
it was the destruction of Jerusalem and the scattering throughout the whole world of the Jewish nation, with whom the Church existed. The fourth close of an age is that of the present-day Christian 
Church, which is foretold by the Lord in the Gospels and also in John, in the Book of Revelation, and which is now at hand. </p>

Quid Consummatio Saeculi seu Ultimum Judicium, prius explicatum est, quod nempe sit ultimum tempus Ecclesiae; ultimum ejus tempus dicitur quando ibi nulla amplius charitas et fides; et quoque ostensum 
quod tales consummationes seu ultima tempora aliquoties exstiterint; primae Ecclesiae consummatio {1} descripta est per Diluvium; secundae Ecclesiae consummatio per exstirpationem gentium in 
terra Canaane, et quoque per exstirpationes et excisiones plures apud Prophetas; tertiae Ecclesiae consummatio non describitur in Verbo, sed praedicitur, quae fuit destructio Hierosolymae, et dissipatio 
gentis Judaicae apud quam Ecclesia fuit, in universum orbem; quarta consummatio est Ecclesiae hodiernae {2} Christianae quae a Domino apud {3} Evangelistas et quoque apud Johannem in Apocalypsi, 
praedicitur {4}, et quae nunc instat.      @1 i in Verbo$      @2 hodie$      @3 per$      @4 describitur$ </p>
