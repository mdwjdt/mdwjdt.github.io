<h3 align="center" class="ired">属天的奥秘 第6554节</h3>
<h4 align="center"></h4><p><strong>6554.</strong>“并一切同他上去埋葬他父亲的人”表有助于重生的一切。这从“埋葬”的含义清楚可知，“埋葬”是指重生和复活（参看<a href="2916.htm">2916</a>，<a href="2917.htm">2917</a>，<a href="4621.htm">4621</a>，<a href="6516.htm">6516</a>节），以出教会的复活和重建（参看<a href="5551.htm">5551</a>，<a href="6516.htm">6516</a>节）。“一切同他上去的人”表示有助于重生的一切，因为他们组成约瑟的全家，还有他父亲的家，以及法老家的众长老和埃及地的众长老。“约瑟的家”表示属灵层的属天事物（<a href="6526.htm">6526</a>节）；“他父亲的家”表示属于属灵良善的一切事物（<a href="6528.htm">6528</a>节）；“法老家的众长老”表示与良善一致的事物（<a href="6524.htm">6524</a>节）；“埃及地的众长老”表示与真理一致的事物（参看<a href="6525.htm">6525</a>节）。由此明显可知，“一切同他上去埋葬的人”表示有助于重生的一切。“埋葬”既表示重生，也表示复活，同样表示教会的复活和重建，这是因为所表示的这些行动包含相似之物；事实上，重生就是复活，因为当人在重生时，他正在从一个死人变成一个活人，因而复活。教会正在人里面复活并重建时也一样；因为这一切通过重生，因而通过从死里复活得生命而实现。</p>

And all that went up with him to bury his father. That this signifies all things that conduce to regeneration, is evident from the signification of "burying," as being regeneration and resurrection (see 
n. 2916, 2917, 4621, 6516); and as being the resuscitation and setting up again of the church (see n. 5551, 6516). All things which conduce thereto are signified by "all that went up with him," for 
they were the whole house of Joseph, also the house of his father, and likewise the elders of the house of Pharaoh, and the elders of the land of Egypt; and by the "house of Joseph" are signified the 
celestial things of the spiritual (n. 6526); by the "house of his father," all things of spiritual good (n. 6528); by the "elders of the house of Pharaoh," those which agree with good (n. 6524); and 
by the "elders of the land of Egypt," those which agree with truth (see n. 6525). Hence it is plain that by "all who went up with him to bury" are signified all things that conduce to regeneration. That 
"to bury" signifies both regeneration and resurrection, and likewise the resuscitation and setting up again of the church, is because these significations involve what is like; for regeneration is 
resurrection, because when man is being regenerated he is becoming alive from being dead, thus is rising again. And in like manner when the church is being resuscitated and set up again in a man; for 
this is effected by regeneration, thus by resurrection from death unto life. </p>

<p align="center"><b>Elliott(1983-1999) 6554</b></p><p><b>6554.</b>
'And all who went up with him to bury his father' means all that contributes to regeneration. This is clear from the meaning of 'burying' as regeneration and resurrection, dealt with in <a href="2916.htm">2916</a>, <a href="2917.htm">2917</a>, <a href="4621.htm">4621</a>, <a href="6516.htm">6516</a>, and as the restoration to life and establishment of the Church, <a href="5551.htm">5551</a>, <a href="6516.htm">6516</a>. All that contributes to it is meant by 'all who went up with him', for they consisted of the whole house of Joseph, 
also his father's house, as well as the elders of Pharaoh's house and the elders of the land of Egypt. 'Joseph's house' means things constituting the celestial of the spiritual, <a href="6526.htm">6526</a>; 'his father's 
house' all the things that belong to spiritual good, <a href="6528.htm">6528</a>; 'the elders of Pharaoh's house' those that accord with good, <a href="6524.htm">6524</a>; and 'the elders of the land of Egypt' those that accord with truth, <a href="6525.htm">6525</a>. 
From all this it is evident that 'all who went up with him to bury' means all that contributes to regeneration. The reason why 'burying' means regeneration as well as resurrection, and also the restoration 
to life and establishment of the Church, is that these operations which are meant are similar to one another in what they entail; for regeneration is resurrection, in that when a person is being 
regenerated he is being turned from one who is dead into one who is alive, thus is rising again. Similarly with the restoration to life and establishment of the Church with a person, for this is effected 
through regeneration, thus through resurrection from death to life. </p>

`Et omnes ascendentes cum eo ad sepeliendum patrem ejus': quod significet omnia quae ad regenerationem conducunt, constat ex significatione `sepeliri' quod sit regeneratio et resurrectio, de qua n. 
2916, 2917, 4621, 6516; et quod sit exsuscitatio et instauratio Ecclesiae, n. 5551, 6516; omnia quae conducunt ad illam, significantur per `omnes ascendentes cum eo', erant enim tota domus Josephi, tum 
domus patris ejus, ut et seniores domus Pharaonis ac seniores terrae Aegypti; {1}et per `domum Josephi' significantur caelestia spiritualis, n. 6526; per `domum patris ejus' omnia illa quae sunt boni 
spiritualis, n. 6528; per `seniores domus Pharaonis' quae concordarent cum bono, n. 6524; et per `seniores terrae Aegypti' quae concordarent cum vero, n. 6525; inde patet quod per `omnes ascendentes 
cum eo ad sepeliendum {2}', significentur omnia quae conducunt ad regenerationem.  Quod `{3}sepeliri' significet tum regenerationem, tum resurrectionem, et quoque exsuscitationem et instaurationem Ecclesiae, 
est quia significationes illae simile involvunt; regeneratio enim est resurrectio, nam cum homo regeneratur, fit ille a mortuo vivus, ita resurgit; similiter cum exsuscitatur et instauratur Ecclesia 
apud hominem, nam hoc fit per regenerationem, ita per resurrectionem a morte ad vitam. @1 per domum enim Josephi$ @2 i patrem ejus$ @3 sepelire I$ </p>
