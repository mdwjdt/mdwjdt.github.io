<h3 align="center" class="ired">属天的奥秘 第5934节</h3>
<h4 align="center"></h4><p><strong>5934.</strong>“说，约瑟的弟兄们来了”表对属世层中的教会真理出现的觉知。这从“来了”的含义和雅各儿子们的代表清楚可知：“来了”是指出现；雅各的儿子们，或约瑟的弟兄们是指属世层中的教会真理（参看<a href="5403.htm">5403</a>，<a href="5419.htm">5419</a>，<a href="5458.htm">5458</a>，<a href="5512.htm">5512</a>节）。属世层中有各种记忆知识：既有关于尘世、肉体和世俗事物的记忆知识，它们占据最低位置，因为这些是直接来自外在感官或身体的事物，或说它们由直接从外在或身体感官所获得的印象构成；也有关于国家、政府体制、法律法规的记忆知识，它们占据稍微内在一点的位置；还有关于道德生活的记忆知识，它们占据更内在的位置。但是，与属灵生活有关的记忆知识所占据的位置比所有前者都更内在。后者是教会的真理。它们若仅仅由于宗教教义而在人那里，不过是记忆知识而已；但当源于他里面的爱之良善时，它们便进入记忆知识之上的一个层面，因为那时它们居于属灵之光，从这光能看到它们之下以适当次序排列的记忆知识。人通过记忆知识的这类上升层级能获得聪明，因为记忆知识通过这些层级打开心智，以便来自灵界的光能够流入。由此可见属世层中的教会真理是什么意思。</p>

<p align="center"><b>Potts(1905-1910) 5934</b></p><p><b>5934.</b>
Saying, Joseph's brethren have come. That this signifies a perception that the truths of the church are present in the natural, is evident from the signification of "to have come," as being presence; 
and from the representation of the sons of Jacob, or of Joseph's brethren, as being the truths of the church in the natural (see n. 5403, 5419, 5458, 5512). In the natural there are memory-knowledges 
of various kinds: there are memory-knowledges about earthly, bodily, and worldly things, which are the lowest, for these are immediately from the things of the external senses, or of the body; there 
are memory-knowledges about the civil state, its government, statutes, and laws, which are a little more interior; there are memory-knowledges about the things of moral life, which are more interior still. 
But the memory-knowledges which belong to spiritual life are more interior than all the former. These latter are truths of the church, which insofar as they are only from doctrine with a man, are 
nothing but memory-knowledges; but when they are from the good of love, they then rise above memory-knowledges, for they are then in spiritual light, from which they look at memory-knowledges in their 
order beneath them. By means of such degrees of memory-knowledges a man mounts to intelligence, for by means of these degrees memory-knowledges open the mind so that light from the spiritual world 
can flow in. From all this it is now evident what is meant by the presence of truths in the natural. </p>

'Saying, Joseph's brothers have come' means [a perception] that the truths of the Church within the natural were present. This is clear from the meaning of 'having come as being present; and from the 
representation of the sons of Jacob or 'Joseph's brothers' as the truths of the Church within the natural, dealt with in <a href="5403.htm">5403</a>, <a href="5419.htm">5419</a>, <a href="5458.htm">5458</a>, <a href="5512.htm">5512</a>. Existing within the natural there is factual knowledge 
of various kinds. There is factual knowledge which has to do with earthly, bodily, and worldly matters; this occupies the lowest position since it consists of impressions received directly from the external 
or bodily senses. There is also factual knowledge which has to do with one's country, its system of government, and laws and statutes, which occupies a slightly more internal position There is 
factual knowledge which has to do with matters of right conduct, which occupies a position still more internal. And there is knowledge which has to do with spiritual life occupying positions interior 
to them all; this consists of the truths known to the Church. To the extent that these truths exist with a person solely as a result of religious teaching they are no more than factual knowledge; but 
once they stem from the good of love in him they go onto a level above factual knowledge, for they now dwell in spiritual light, from which they can look at factual knowledge arrayed in proper order 
beneath them. By means of such rising degrees of factual knowledge a person attains intelligence; for factual knowledge at each level opens the mind so that light from the spiritual world may flow in. 
From all this one may now see what is meant by the truths of the Church within the natural being present. </p>

`Dicendo, Venerunt fratres Josephi':  quod significet quod praesentia vera Ecclesiae in naturali, constat ex significatione `venisse' quod sit praesentia; et ex repraesentatione `filiorum Jacobi', seu 
`fratrum Josephi', quod sint vera Ecclesiae in naturali, de qua n. 5403, 5419, 5458, 5512. Sunt in naturali scientifica varii generis; sunt scientifica de terrestribus, corporeis et mundanis, quae 
sunt infima, {1}nam haec sunt immediate ex sensualibus externis seu corporis; sunt scientifica de statu civili, ejus regimine, statutis et legibus, quae sunt paulo interiora; sunt scientifica de illis 
quae sunt vitae moralis, quae sunt adhuc interiora; quae autem sunt vitae spiritualis, sunt illis omnibus interiora; haec sunt vera Ecclesiae, quae quatenus solum ex doctrina apud hominem sunt, {2}non 
aliud sunt quam scientifica, at cum ex bono {3}amoris, tunc vadunt supra scientifica, nam tunc in luce spirituali sunt e qua spectant scientifica in suo ordine infra se; homo per tales gradus scientificorum 
ascendit {4} ad intelligentiam, scientifica enim per illos gradus aperiunt mentem ut lux e mundo spirituali influere possit. Ex his nunc patet quid intelligitur per praesentiam verorum {5} in 
naturali. @1 A had sunt enim haec but i nam before sunt and d haec. Clearly enim should have been deleted instead of haec$ @2 nec$ @3 charitatis$ @4 i ab infantia$ @5 i Ecclesiae$ </p>
