<h3 align="center" class="ired">属天的奥秘 第10481节</h3>
<h4 align="center"></h4><p><strong>10481</strong>.“以致起来反对他们的人要消灭他们”表他们没有任何能力来抵制来自地狱的邪恶和虚假。这从“消灭”和“起来反对的人”或仇敌的含义清楚可知：“消灭”是指被剥夺抵制邪恶和虚假的一切能力，因为在灵界，被剥夺这种能力就根本没有任何能力；“起来反对的人”或仇敌是指邪恶和由此产生的虚假，这些就是灵义上起来的仇敌。因此，在圣言中，“仇敌或敌人”和“起来的人”也表示这些邪恶和虚假（<a href="2851.htm">2851</a>，<a href="8289.htm">8289</a>，<a href="9255.htm">9255</a>，<a href="9314.htm">9314</a>节），如诗篇：<br />耶和华啊，我的敌人何其加增！有许多人起来攻击我；论到我的灵魂说，他在神那里得不到救助。（诗篇<a href="http://39-27.cn/诗3.1.htm">3:1</a>，<a href="http://39-27.cn/诗3.2.htm">2</a>）<br /><br />求你显出你奇妙的怜悯来，你是那用右手拯救投靠你的，脱离起来攻击他们的人。（诗篇<a href="http://39-27.cn/诗17.7.htm">17:7</a>-<a href="http://39-27.cn/诗17.9.htm">9</a>）<br /><br />求你不要把我交给敌人，遂其所愿；因为妄作见证的和喷出凶暴的，起来攻击我；我若不信在生命之地得见美物。（诗篇<a href="http://39-27.cn/诗27.12.htm">27:12</a>，<a href="http://39-27.cn/诗27.13.htm">13</a>）<br /><br />神啊，求你出令使雅各得救！我们靠你要击打我们的敌人，靠你的名要践踏那起来攻击我们的人。（诗篇<a href="http://39-27.cn/诗44.4.htm">44:4</a>，<a href="http://39-27.cn/诗44.5.htm">5</a>）<br /><br />外人起来攻击我，强暴人寻索我的灵魂；他们不将神摆在他们面前。主是在那些扶持我灵魂者之中的。（诗篇<a href="http://39-27.cn/诗54.3.htm">54:3</a>，<a href="http://39-27.cn/诗54.4.htm">4</a>）<br /><br />我的神啊，求你救我脱离仇敌！把我安置在高处，得脱那些起来攻击我的人；求你救我脱离作孽的人。看哪！他们埋伏要害我的灵魂。（诗篇<a href="http://39-27.cn/诗59.1.htm">59:1</a>-<a href="http://39-27.cn/诗59.3.htm">3</a>）<br />在这些和其它许多经文中，“仇敌或敌人”和“起来的人”表示来自地狱的邪恶和虚假。它们之所以被称为“起来的人”，是因为邪恶和虚假起来攻击良善和真理，而不是反过来。<br />那些兴趣在于与内在之物分离的外在事物的人根本没有任何能力抵制来自地狱的邪恶和虚假，因为抵制它们的一切能力皆来自神性。因此，那些与内在之物分离，也与神性分离的人没有任何能力；结果，他们被邪恶和虚假载到地狱带他们所到之处，就像风中的绒毛或稻草；这一点在从世界进入来世的恶人身上是显而易见的。这一点也由以色列民族来代表，因为只要遵守吩咐给他们的这种敬拜，他们就会战胜敌人，但每当他们放弃这种敬拜，因而每当他们被邪恶主宰时，就被敌人击败，正如摩西五经中所说的：<br />你若厌弃我的律例，飘荡落叶的声音，要追赶你，你必逃跑，像逃避剑，无人追赶，却要跌倒。无人追赶，他们要彼此撞跌，像在剑之前。（利未记<a href="http://39-27.cn/利26.15.htm">26:15</a>，<a href="http://39-27.cn/利26.36.htm">36</a>，<a href="http://39-27.cn/利26.37.htm">37</a>）<br />别处：<br />一个必能追赶一千，两个追赶一万；因为他们的磐石卖了他们，耶和华把它们关闭。（申命记<a href="http://39-27.cn/申32.30.htm">32:30</a>）<br />由此明显可知“以致起来反对他们的人要消灭他们”是什么意思。</p>

Unto annihilation by those rising up against them. That this signifies that they lacked all power to resist the evils and falsities which are from hell, is evident from the signification of "annihilation," 
as being that they lacked all power to resist evils and falsities, for in the spiritual world this is to have no power; and from the signification of "those rising up against," or enemies, as being 
evils and the derivative falsities, for in the spiritual sense these are the enemies which rise up. Wherefore also these are signified in the Word by "enemies," and "those who rise up against," as 
in David: </p>
<p>     O Jehovah, how greatly are mine enemies multiplied! Many are those who rise up against me, saying of my soul, There is no salvation for him in God (Ps. 3:1, 2).      Make wonderful 
Thy mercy, O Savior of the confiding, from those who rise up against me, by Thy right hand. Keep me from the wicked, who compass me about against my soul (Ps. 17:7-9).      Deliver me not into the desire 
of mine enemies; for witnesses of a lie have risen up against me, and he that breathes out violence: unless I had believed to see good in the land of life (Ps. 27:12, 13).      O God, command salvation 
for Jacob. Through Thee will we strike our enemies; in Thy name will we trample on those who rise up against us (Ps. 44:4, 5).      Strangers have risen up against me, and the violent have sought 
my soul; they have not set God before them. The Lord is among those who uphold my soul (Ps. 54:3, 4).      Deliver me from mine enemies O my God; set me on high from those who rise up against me. 
Deliver me from the workers of iniquity. Lo, they lie in wait for my soul (Ps. 59:1-3).      In these and many other passages, by "enemies" and "those who rise up against" are signified evils and falsities 
which are from hell. They are called "those who rise up against," because evils and falsities rise up against goods and truths; but not the reverse. [2] That those who are in external things 
separate from what is internal have no power to resist the evils and falsities which are from hell, is because all power to resist these is from the Divine. Wherefore they who have been separated from 
what is internal, who also have been separated from what is Divine, have no power; consequently they are borne along by evils and falsities wherever hell carries them, like a flock and a straw by the 
wind; as is very evident from the evil who come from the world into the other life. This was also represented by that nation's conquering their enemies so long as they remained in the worship which 
was commanded them, and being conquered as often as they fell away from this worship, thus as often as they were in evil, according to these words in Moses: </p>
<p>     If ye shall reject My statutes, the sound 
of a driven leaf shall chase you, and ye shall flee as fleeing from a sword; and ye shall fall when none pursueth. They shall fall a man on his brother, as before a sword, when none pursueth (Lev. 
26:15, 36, 37).      One shall chase a thousand, and two ten thousand, because their Rock hath sold them, and Jehovah hath shut them up (Deut. 32:30). From all this it is evident what is signified 
by "to be for annihilation by those who rise up against them." </p>

'That those rising up against them would annihilate them' means being left without any power to withstand evils [and falsities] that come from hell. This is clear from the meaning of 'being annihilated' 
as being deprived of all power to withstand evils and falsities, for in the spiritual world being deprived of that power is having no power at all; and from the meaning of 'those rising up', or enemies, 
as evils and resulting falsities, these being the enemies that rise up in the spiritual sense. Therefore also such evils and falsities are meant in the Word by 'enemies' and 'those rising up', <a href="2851.htm">2851</a>, <a href="8289.htm">8289</a>, <a href="9255.htm">9255</a>, <a href="9314.htm">9314</a>, as in David,  </p>

</blockquote>
<p>In these and very many other places 'enemies' and 'those rising up' mean evils and falsities which come from hell. The expression 'those rising 
up' is used because evils and falsities rise up against forms of good and truths, but not vice versa.  </p>
<p></p>
<p><b>[2]</b>
 Those whose interest lies in external things separated from what is internal have no power 
at all to withstand evils and falsities which come from hell because all power to withstand them comes from the Divine. Those therefore who are separated from what is internal, being separated from 
the Divine as well, have no power; as a result they are borne along by evils and falsities, wherever hell takes them, like fluff or a straw in the wind, as is plainly evident from the evil who enter 
the next life from the world. This was also represented by the Israelite nation, in that they were victorious over their enemies as long as they kept to the kind of worship which they had been commanded, 
but were defeated by them every time they forsook that worship, thus whenever they were ruled by evil, according to the following in Moses,  </p>
<blockquote>
If you despise My statutes, the sound of a driven 
leaf will pursue you, and you will flee, like flight from the sword, and you will fall without [anyone] pursuing. They will stumble over one another<A name="fntext4"></a><A href="#fn4"><sup>d</sup></a>, as though before the sword, when no one is pursuing.

<p>And elsewhere,  </p>
<blockquote>
One will pursue a thousand, and two ten thousand; for their Rock sold them, and Jehovah shut them up. <a href="http://bible.gospelcom.net/cgi-bin/bible?passage=Deut%2032:30&amp;version=ESV&amp;interface=print&amp;showfn=yes&amp;showxref">Deut 32:30</a>.

<p>From all this it is evident what 
the meaning is of 'those rising up would annihilate them'.

`Ad annihilationem insurgentibus illorum': quod significet absque omni potentia resistendi malis [et falsis] quae ab inferno, constat ex significatione `annihilationis' quod sit absque omni potentia 
resistendi malis et falsis, hoc enim in spirituali mundo est nihil posse; et ex significatione `insurgentium' seu hostium, quod sint mala et inde falsa, nam haec sunt hostes qui insurgunt in sensu spirituali; 
quare etiam illa per `hostes' et `insurgentes' in Verbo significantur, n. 2851, 8289, 9255, 9314, ut apud Davidem, 	Jehovah, quantum multiplicati sunt hostes mei! multi insurgentes contra me, 
dicentes de anima mea, Non salus illi in Deo, Ps. iii [2,] 3 [A.V. 1, 2]: </p>
<p>apud eundem, 	Mirabilem fac misericordiam Tuam, Salvator confidentium ab insurgentibus contra me, per dextram Tuam: custodi 
me pro impiis qui vastant me, hostibus meis qui contra animam meam circumdant me, Ps. xvii 7-9: </p>
<p>apud eundem, 	Ne tradas me in desiderium hostium meorum, quia surrexerunt contra me testes mendacii, 
et qui efflat violentiam; ne crederem videre bonum in terra vitae, Ps. xxvii 12, 13: </p>
<p>apud eundem, 	Deus, praecipe salutes Jacobi; per Te hostes nostros feriemus,  in nomine Tuo conculcabimus insurgentes 
contra nos, Ps. xliv 5, 6 [A.V. 4, 5]: </p>
<p>apud eundem, 	Alieni surrexerunt contra me, et violenti quaesiverunt animam  meam; non posuerunt Deum ante se; Dominus inter sustentantes  animam meam, 
Ps. liv 5, 6 [A.V. 3, 4]: </p>
<p>apud eundem, 	Libera me ab hostibus meis, Deus mi, ab insurgentibus contra  me exalta me; libera me ab operatoribus iniquitatis; ecce insidiantur animae meae, Ps. lix 2-4 [A.V. 
1-3]; </p>
<p>in his et pluribus aliis locis per `hostes' et `insurgentes' significantur mala et falsa quae ab inferno; dicuntur `insurgentes' quia mala et falsa insurgunt contra bona et vera, non autem 
 vicissim. 	[2] Quod illis (x)qui in externis separatis ab interno nihil potentiae sit resistendi malis et falsis quae ab inferno, est quia omnis potentia resistendi illis est a Divino, quare illis 
qui separati sunt ab interno, qui etiam separati sunt a Divino, nulla potentia est; inde feruntur a malis et falsis, quocumque aufert illos infernum, sicut floccus {1}aut palea a vento, ut manifeste patet 
(c)a malis qui e mundo in alteram vitam veniunt; hoc quoque repraesentatum {2}est per illam gentem, quod hostes suos vicerint, quamdiu {3} manserunt in cultu qui (x)illis mandatus erat {4}, at {5} 
quod toties victi fuerint, cum a cultu illo recesserunt, ita quoties in malo fuerunt, secundum haec apud Moschen,      Si statuta Mea reprobaveritis, persequetur suos sonus folii impulsi, et fugietis
