<h3 align="center" class="ired">属天的奥秘 第7396节</h3>
<h4 align="center"></h4><p><strong>7396.</strong>“我要何时为你和你的臣仆并你的百姓祈求”表为那些沉浸于虚假并进行侵扰的人代求。这从“祈求”的含义和“法老”的代表清楚可知：“祈求”因是为了别人，故是指代求；“法老”是指那些沉浸于虚假并进行侵扰的人（<a href="7107.htm">7107</a>，<a href="7110.htm">7110</a>，<a href="7126.htm">7126</a>，<a href="7142.htm">7142</a>，<a href="7317.htm">7317</a>节）。由于法老代表这些人，所以“他的臣仆并他的百姓”表示他们当中的所有人和每一个人；因为“臣仆”是指那些属于较低等级和事奉者的人，而“百姓”是指个体人。各帝国和王国在天堂呈现为一个人，它们里面的社群则呈现为人体的各个部位；而君王或帝王可以说是头。它们以这种方式来呈现的原因可追溯到这一点：整个天堂代表一个人，其中的社群照着它们的功能而代表其身体的各个部位。由此可见，在天上，一个帝国、王国或社群，如果其公民通过仁与信彼此联结形成这样一个身体，那么它的代表将何等美丽、令人快乐。只要有可能，主就以这种方式将社群联结在一起；因为从主发出的神性真理本身会将这种秩序引入凡接受它的地方；这是存在于天堂的秩序状态的源头。它也存在于地上，只是构成它的社群分散在全世界，由那些处于对主之爱和对邻之仁的人构成。不过，这些分散的社群会被主聚拢起来，好叫它们也像天上的社群那样代表一个人。这些社群不仅在教会之内，也在教会之外；当全都合在一起时，它们被称为主的教会；该教会是由分散在全世界的善人聚集而成的，也被称为一个社群。这个社群或教会就是主在地上的国，这国与主在天上的国联结，由此与主自己联结。</p>

Till when shall I supplicate for thee, and for thy servants, and for thy people? That this signifies intercession for those who are in falsities and infest, is evident from the signification of "supplicating" 
because for another, as being intercession; and from the representation of Pharaoh, as being those who are in falsities and infest (n. 7107, 7110, 7126, 7142, 7317); and as when his servants 
and his people are also added, these are represented by Pharaoh, then all and each are meant, for "servants" denote those who are of a lower sort and minister, and "people" denote the individuals. Empires 
and kingdoms are represented in heaven as a man, and the societies therein as the members of that man; but the king as the head. This representation has its ground in the fact that the universal 
heaven represents one man, and the societies therein his members, and this according to their functions. This shows how beautiful and delightful would be the representation of an empire, kingdom, and 
society in heaven, if they in like manner were conjoined among themselves by charity and faith. Moreover, wherever possible the Lord joins societies together in this way, for the Divine truth itself 
which proceeds from the Lord introduces this order wherever it is received, and this is the source of this order in heaven. It exists also on earth, but the societies which constitute it are scattered 
through the whole world, and are those who are in love to Him and in charity toward the neighbor. But these scattered societies have been gathered together by the Lord in order that they also, like the 
societies in heaven, may represent one man.  These societies are not only within the church, but also outside of it, and taken together are called the Lord's Church scattered and gathered from the 
good in the universal world, which is also called a communion. This communion, that is, this church, is the Lord's kingdom on earth conjoined with the Lord's kingdom in the heavens, and thus is conjoined 
with the Lord Himself. </p>

'Till when shall I plead for you, and for your servants, and for your people' means intercession made for those steeped in falsities who engage in molestation. This is clear from the meaning of 'pleading', 
since it is done on behalf of another, as intercession; and from the representation of 'Pharaoh' as those who are steeped in falsities and engage in molestation, dealt with in <a href="7107.htm">7107</a>, <a href="7110.htm">7110</a>, <a href="7126.htm">7126</a>, <a href="7142.htm">7142</a>, <a href="7717.htm">7717</a>. Since these are represented by Pharaoh, 'his servants' and 'his people', when mentioned in addition, mean each and every one of them; for 'servants' are those who belong to a lower rank and 
minister, while 'people' are the individual ones. Empires and kingdoms are represented in heaven as a person, and the communities within them are represented as the parts of that person's body, the 
monarch being so to speak its head. The reason why they are represented in that way traces back to this: The whole of heaven represents one human being, and the communities there represent the parts 
of his body, in accordance with the functions they perform. From this one may see how beautiful and delightful the representation in heaven of an empire, kingdom, or community would be if its citizens 
were linked to one another by charity and faith to form a body like that. Whenever possible the Lord also links communities together into that kind of body; for Divine Truth itself, which emanates from 
the Lord, introduces that state of order wherever that order is accepted. This is the origin of the state of order that exists in heaven. It exists on earth took, but the communities constituting it 
are scattered all over the earth and are made up of those who are governed by love to Him and charity towards the neighbour. But those scattered communities have been drawn together by the Lord in order 
that they too, like communities in heaven, may represent one human being. These communities exist not only within the Church but also outside it; and when taken all together they are called the Lord's 
Church, drawn together from the good scattered throughout all the earth. That Church is also called a communion. This communion or Church is the Lord's kingdom on earth linked to the Lord's kingdom 
in heaven, and so to the Lord Himself. </p>

`Quousque supplicabo tibi, et servis tuis, et populo tuo': quod significet intercessionem pro illis (x)qui in falsis et infestant, constat ex significatione `supplicare,' quia est pro alio, quod sit 
intercessio; et ex repraesentatione `Pharaonis' quod sint qui in falsis et infestant, de qua n. 7107, 7110, 7126, 7142, 7317; et quia illi per `Pharaonem' repraesentantur, cum etiam adjiciuntur `servi 
ejus' et `populus ejus,' intelliguntur omnes et singuli, servi enim sunt qui inferioris sortis sunt et ministrant, populus sunt singuli; imperia et regna {1} repraesentantur in caelo sicut homo, et 
{2}societates quae inibi sunt repraesentantur sicut membra illius hominis; rex (d)autem sicut caput; repraesentativum hoc {3} inde ducit causam quia universum caelum repraesentat unum hominem, {4}ac societates 
ibi repraesentant membra ejus, et hoc secundum functiones; inde constare potest quam pulchra et jucunda repraesentatio imperii, regni, (c)et societatis, {5}esset in caelo, {6} si inter se per 
charitatem et fidem similiter conjuncti essent; Dominus etiam ubicumque hoc dari potest, ita societates conjungit, ipsum enim Divinum Verum, quod a Domino procedit, illum ordinem introducit ubicumque 
ille recipitur; inde est ille ordo in caelo; est quoque in terris, sed societates {7} quae (c)illum constituunt sunt sparsae per totum terrarum orbem, suntque illi qui in amore in Ipsum et in charitate 
(x)erga proximum sunt; sed sparsae illae societates a Domino collectae sunt ut quoque unum hominem, sicut societates in caelo, repraesentent; hae societates (x)non modo sunt intra Ecclesiam sed etiam 
extra illam, et simul sumptae vocantur Ecclesia Domini {8}sparsa et collecta a bonis in universo terrarum orbe, (t)quae quoque vocatur communio; haec communio seu haec Ecclesia est regnum Domini in 
terris conjunctum regno Domini in caelis, ac ita conjunctum Ipsi Domino. 	@1 i, tum quoque societates majores et minores$ 	@2 qui in imperiis et regnis$ 	@3 i in coelo$ 	@4 et quoque utraquavis
