<h4 align="center"></h4><p><strong>231.</strong>洪水前的上古教会、洪水后的古教会、犹太教会、主降临后在非犹太人中兴起的新教会，以及现代的教会，其恶都在于不信主和圣经，只信自己和感官。由此导致无信，无信便无邻舍之爱，结果全是错误和罪恶。</p>

<p><strong>[NCE]231.</strong> A single evil afflicted not only the earliest church, before the Flood, but also the ancient church, after the Flood, and the Jewish church, and then the new church or the church among non-Jews that came after the Lord's arrival into the world,{*1} just as it afflicts the modern church. It is the evil of not believing the Lord or the Word but trusting oneself and one's senses. The result is an absence of faith, and when faith is absent, so is love for others — a situation that leads to all falsity and evil.<br /><br /><strong>Footnotes:</strong><br />{*1} By "the church among non-Jews" (ecclesia gentium, in the Latin) Swedenborg seems to mean the early Christian church as expanded by Paul to include non-Jews (see, for example, <a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_231/bible_king-james-version_acts-of-the-apostles_9_15" target=_top>Acts 9:15</a>; <a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_231/bible_king-james-version_acts-of-the-apostles_13_47" target=_top>13:47</a>). Specifically, the Latin word here translated as "non-Jews" is gentium, literally, "nations;" the traditional translation is "Gentiles." Swedenborg uses this term differently in different contexts. In <a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_231/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_367" target=_top>367</a> below, the term clearly means "non-Jews" as opposed to Jews; in <a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_231/swedenborg_heaven-and-hell-dole_516" target=_top>Heaven and Hell 516</a>, it means certain unspecified non-Christians who are also not Muslims. In <a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_231/swedenborg_heaven-and-hell-dole_308" target=_top>Heaven and Hell 308</a>, he uses the term to refer to "people who are outside the church, where the Word is not found," and this seems to be the core meaning of the term as he employs it (see <a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_231/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_410" target=_top>410</a> below). In sum it would be safe to say that, although in the current passage the term refers to those within the church, in most instances when Swedenborg speaks of "Gentiles" he refers to those who are outside the church of a given dispensation.

<p align="center"><b>Potts(1905-1910) 231</b></p><p><b>231.</b>
The evil of the Most Ancient Church which existed before the flood, as well as that of the Ancient Church after the flood, and also that of the Jewish Church, and subsequently the evil of the new church, 
or church of the Gentiles, after the coming of the Lord, and also that of the church of the present day, was and is that they do not believe the Lord or the Word, but themselves and their own senses. 
Hence there is no faith, and where there is no faith there is no love of the neighbor, consequently all is false and evil. </p>

<p align="center"><b>Elliott(1983-1999) 231</b></p><p><b>231.</b>
Not believing the Lord or the Word but themselves and their own senses was the evil not only of the Most Ancient Church before the Flood, but also of the Ancient Church after it. It was also the evil 
of the Jewish Church, and later on of the new or gentile Church established after the Lord's Coming, as well as the evil of the Church of today. Consequently no faith exists, and when no faith exists 
neither does any love of the neighbour. Everything therefore is false and evil.  </p>

</p><b>231.</b>
Malum Ecclesiae Antiquissimae non solum quae ante diluvium, sed etiam malum Ecclesiae Antiquae quae post diluvium, tum malum Ecclesiae Judaicae, ut et dein malum Ecclesiae novae seu gentium post Adventum 
Domini, sicut etiam malum Ecclesiae hodiernae, est ut non credant Domino aut Verbo sed sibimet et sensibus suis; inde nulla fides; et cum nulla fides, nullus amor proximi, omne falsum et malum.
