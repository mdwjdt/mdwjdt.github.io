<h3 align="center" class="ired">属天的奥秘 第1250节</h3>
<h4 align="center"></h4><p><strong>1250.</strong>“东边的山”表仁爱，事实上表主的仁爱。这从圣言中“山”的含义清楚可知，“山”表对主之爱和对邻之仁，如前所述（<a href="795.htm">795</a>节）。“东边”表主，因而表爱与仁的属天事物，这一点可见于前文（参看<a href="101.htm">101</a>节），还可见于下列经文，以西结书：<br />于是基路伯展开翅膀。耶和华的荣耀从城中上升，停在城东的那座山上。（以西结书<a href="http://39-27.cn/结11.22.htm">11:22</a>，<a href="http://39-27.cn/结11.23.htm">23</a>）<br />此处“城东的那座山”无非表主爱与仁的属天之物，因为经上说“耶和华的荣耀停在那里”。同一先知书：<br />他带我到一座门，就是朝东的门。看哪，以色列神的荣光从东而来。（以西结书<a href="http://39-27.cn/结43.1.htm">43:1</a>-<a href="http://39-27.cn/结43.2.htm">2</a>）<br />此处“东”具有相同的含义。<br /><br />他又带我回到圣所朝东的外门，那门关闭了。耶和华对我说，这门必须关闭，不可敞开，谁也不可由其中进入，因为耶和华以色列的神已经由其中进入。（以西结书<a href="http://39-27.cn/结44.1.htm">44:1</a>-<a href="http://39-27.cn/结44.2.htm">2</a>）<br />此处“东”也表唯独属于对主之爱的属天之物。<br />王预备甘心献的燔祭和平安祭，就是向耶和华甘心献的，当有人为他开朝东的门，他就预备燔祭和平安祭，与安息日预备的一样。（以西结书<a href="http://39-27.cn/结46.12.htm">46:12</a>）<br />此处“东”同样表属于对主之爱的属天之物。<br />在<br />他带我回到殿门，见殿的门槛下有水往东流出，原来殿面朝东。（以西结书<a href="http://39-27.cn/结47.1.htm">47:1</a>，<a href="http://39-27.cn/结47.8.htm">8</a>）<br />这论及新耶路撒冷。“东”表主，因而表爱的属天之物，而“水”表属灵之物。在本节经文中，“东边的山”所表相同。而且，那些住在叙利亚的人被称为“东方人”。对此，蒙主怜悯，容后再述。</p>

<p><strong>[NCE]1250.</strong> The symbolism of the mountain of the east as charity, specifically the quality of charity received from the Lord, can be seen from the following symbolism in the Word: A mountain symbolizes love for the Lord and charity toward our neighbor (as shown above at <a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_1250/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_795" target=_top>795</a>). The east symbolizes the Lord and heavenly qualities received from him, which are qualities of love and charity (again, see above, <a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_1250/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_101" target=_top>101</a>). The symbolism can also be seen in the following passages. In Ezekiel:<br />The guardian beings lifted their wings. The glory of Jehovah went up from the middle of the city and stood on the mountain that was on the east of the city. (<a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_1250/bible_king-james-version_ezekiel_11_22-23" target=_top>Ezekiel 11:22-23</a>)<br />The sole meaning of the mountain that was on the east is the heavenly quality that belongs to love and charity — these being the Lord's, because it says that the glory of Jehovah stood there.<br />[2] In the same author:<br />He led me to the gate, a gate that looks out on the path to the east, and there! The glory of Israel's God came by way of the east. (<a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_1250/bible_king-james-version_ezekiel_43_1-2" target=_top>Ezekiel 43:1-2</a>)<br />The east has a similar meaning here. In the same author:<br />And he brought me back by way of the gate of the outer sanctuary looking to the east, and it was shut. And Jehovah said to me, "This gate shall be shut; it shall not be opened; and not a man shall go in through it. But Jehovah, God of Israel, will go in through it." (<a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_1250/bible_king-james-version_ezekiel_44_1-2" target=_top>Ezekiel 44:1-2</a>)<br />Again the east stands for a heavenly quality, which is the quality of love, which is the Lord's alone. In the same author:<br />When the chief makes a voluntary offering, a burnt offering, or peace offerings, it is a voluntary offering to Jehovah. And he shall open to [Jehovah] the gate looking toward the east and make his burnt offering and his peace offerings as he does on the Sabbath day. (<a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_1250/bible_king-james-version_ezekiel_46_12" target=_top>Ezekiel 46:12</a>)<br />Here too the east stands for a heavenly quality, which is the quality of love for the Lord.<br />[3] In the same author:<br />And he brought me back to the doorway of the House, and look! Water going out from under the doorsill of the House toward the east; because the House faces east. (<a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_1250/bible_king-james-version_ezekiel_47_1" target=_top>Ezekiel 47:1</a>, <a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_1250/bible_king-james-version_ezekiel_47_8" target=_top>8</a>)<br />This is about a new Jerusalem. The east stands for the Lord and so for the heavenly quality of love. The water means spiritual qualities.<br />The mountain of the east in the present verse has a similar meaning. In addition, people who lived in Syria were called the children of the east, and they will be discussed later [<a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_1250/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_3249" target=_top>3249</a>, <a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_1250/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_3762" target=_top>3762</a>], with the Lord's divine mercy. </p>

That "a mountain of the east" signifies charity, and in fact charity from the Lord, is evident from the signification of a "mountain" in the Word, as being love to the Lord and charity toward the neighbor, 
as has been shown before (n. 795). And that "the east" signifies the Lord, and things celestial from Him, which are of love and charity, may be seen above (n. 101), as well as from the following 
passages. In Ezekiel: </p>
<p>     The cherubim lifted up their wings, and the glory of Jehovah went up from the midst of the city, and stood upon the mountain which is on the east of the city (Ezek. 11:22-23). Here 
"the mountain which is on the east" signifies nothing else than what is celestial, which is of love and charity, and which is of the Lord, for it is said that "the glory of Jehovah stood" 
thereon. Again: </p>
<p>     He brought me to the gate, even the gate that looketh to the way of the east; and behold the glory of the God of Israel came from the way of the east (Ezek. 43:1-2), where "the 
east" has a like signification.  [2] Again: </p>
<p>     He brought me back by the way of the outer gate of the sanctuary which looketh toward the east, and it was shut. And Jehovah said unto me, This gate 
shall be shut, it shall not be opened, neither shall any man enter in by it, but Jehovah the God of Israel shall enter in by it (Ezek. 44:1-2). Here likewise "the east" denotes what is celestial, which 
is of love, which is of the Lord alone. And again: </p>
<p>When the prince shall make a freewill offering, a burnt-offering, and peace-offerings, a freewill offering unto Jehovah, one shall open for Him the 
gate that looketh toward the east, and he shall make his burnt-offering and his peace-offerings, as he shall do on the Sabbath day (Ezek. 46:12), in like manner denoting what is celestial, which is 
of love to the Lord.  [3] And in another place: </p>
<p>     He brought me back unto the door of the house, and behold waters issued out from under the threshold of the house eastward, for the face of the 
house was toward the east (Ezek. 47:1, 8), speaking of the New Jerusalem "the east" denotes the Lord, and thus the celestial, which is of love; "waters" are things spiritual. The same is signified in 
the passage before us by "a mountain of the east." Moreover they who dwelt in Syria were called "sons of the east," concerning which, of the Lord's Divine mercy hereafter. </p>

That 'the mountain of the east' means charity, indeed charity from the Lord, is clear from the meaning of 'a mountain' in the Word as love to the Lord and charity towards the neighbour, as shown already 
in <a href="795.htm">795</a>. And that 'the east' means the Lord, and consequently the celestial things of love and charity, see again what has appeared already in <a href="101.htm">101</a>, and also in the following places: In Ezekiel, </p>
<blockquote>
The 
cherubs lifted up their wings. The glory of Jehovah went up from over the midst of the city and stood upon the mountain, which is on the east of the city. <a href="http://bible.gospelcom.net/cgi-bin/bible?passage=Ezek%2011:22,%2023&amp;version=ESV&amp;interface=print&amp;showfn=yes&amp;showxref">Ezek 11:22, 23</a>. 
</blockquote>
<p>Here 'the mountain which 
is on the east' means nothing other than the celestial manifestation of the love and the charity that is the Lord's, for it is said that 'the glory of Jehovah stood there'. In the same prophet, </p>
<blockquote>
He 
brought me to the gate, to the gate facing the way of the east. And behold, the glory of the God of Israel came from the way of the east. <a href="http://bible.gospelcom.net/cgi-bin/bible?passage=Ezek%2043:1,%202&amp;version=ESV&amp;interface=print&amp;showfn=yes&amp;showxref">Ezek 43:1, 2</a>. 
</blockquote>
<p>Here 'the east' has a similar meaning.  </p>
<p></p>
<p><b>[2]</b>
In the same prophet, </p>
<blockquote>
And he brought me back by the way of the outer gate of the sanctuary, which faces the east, and it was shut. And Jehovah said to me, This gate shall be shut and not opened, 
and no man shall enter by it; but Jehovah, the God of Israel, will enter by it. <a href="http://bible.gospelcom.net/cgi-bin/bible?passage=Ezek%2044:1,%202&amp;version=ESV&amp;interface=print&amp;showfn=yes&amp;showxref">Ezek 44:1, 2</a>. 
</blockquote>
<p>Here similarly 'the east' stands for the celestial manifestation of the love that is the Lord's alone. 
In the same prophet, </p>
<blockquote>
When the prince makes a freewill offering, a burnt offering, and peace offerings, as a freewill offering to Jehovah, one shall open for him the gate facing towards the east, 
and he shall make his burnt offering and his peace offerings, as he shall do on the sabbath day <a href="http://bible.gospelcom.net/cgi-bin/bible?passage=Ezek%2046:12&amp;version=ESV&amp;interface=print&amp;showfn=yes&amp;showxref">Ezek 46:12</a>. 
</blockquote>
<p>Here similarly it stands for that which is celestial, which essentially is love to the 
Lord. </p>
<p></p>
<p><b>[3]</b>
 In the same prophet, </p>
<blockquote>
He brought me back to the door of the house, and behold, waters were issuing out from below the threshold of the house towards the east, for the house faced east. 
<a href="http://bible.gospelcom.net/cgi-bin/bible?passage=Ezek%2047:1,%208&amp;version=ESV&amp;interface=print&amp;showfn=yes&amp;showxref">Ezek 47:1, 8</a>. 
</blockquote>
<p>This refers to the new Jerusalem 'The east' stands for the Lord, and so for the celestial manifestation of love, while 'waters' means things that are spiritual. Here the same is meant 
by 'the mountain of the east'. Furthermore those who dwelt in Syria were called 'the sons of the east', who will in the Lord's Divine mercy be spoken of later on. </p>

Quod per 'montem orientis' significetur charitas, et quidem charitas a Domino, constat a significatione 'montis' in Verbo quod sit amor in Dominum et charitas erga proximum, quod ostensum prius n. 795; 
et quod 'oriens' significet Dominum, et inde caelestia, quae sunt amoris et charitatis, videatur etiam prius n. 101, tum ab his sequentibus locis; apud Ezechielem, Sustulerunt cherubi alas suas, 
...ascendit gloria Jehovae desuper medio civitatis, et stetit super monte, qui ab oriente civitatis, xi 22, 23; </p>
<p>ubi per 'montem qui ab oriente,' nihil aliud significatur quam caeleste quod est amoris 
et charitatis quae est Domini, nam dicitur quod 'gloria Jehovae ibi steterit':  apud eundem, Duxit me ad portam, portam quae spectat viam orientis, et ecce gloria Dei Israelis venit a via orientis, 
xliii 1, 2; </p>
<p>ubi per 'orientem' simile significatur:  [2]apud eundem, Et reduxit me via portae sanctuarii exterioris spectantis orientem, et illa clausa, et dixit ad me Jehovah, Porta haec clausa erit, 
non aperietur, et vir non intrabit per illam, sed Jehovah Deus Israelis intrabit per illam, xliv 1, 2; </p>
<p>similiter 'oriens' pro caelesti quod est amoris, qui est solius Domini:  apud eundem, Cum faciet 
princeps spontaneum, holocaustum, et pacifica, spontaneum Jehovae, et aperiet illi portam spectantem versus orientem, et faciet holocaustum suum et pacifica sua, sicut faciet in die sabbati, xlvi 
12; </p>
<p>similiter pro caelesti quod est amoris in Dominum:  [3]apud eundem, Reduxit me ad ostium domus, et ecce aquae exeuntes de sub limine domus versus orientem, quia facies domus oriens, xlvii 1, 8; </p>
<p>ibi 
de Nova Hierosolyma; 'oriens' pro Domino, ita pro caelesti quod est amoris; 'aquae' sunt spiritualia.  Simile significat hic 'mons orientis'; praeterea qui habitabant in Syria, dicti sunt 'filii 
orientis,' de quibus, ex Divina Domini Misericordia, in sequentibus. </p>
