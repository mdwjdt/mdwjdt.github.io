<h3 align="center" class="ired">属天的奥秘 第2747节</h3>
<h4 align="center"></h4><p><strong>2747.</strong>由于一切淫行皆违背婚姻之爱，故行淫者无法在天堂与天使同在。他们无法与天使同在的另一个原因是，有违背善与真的事物存在于他们里面，因此他们不在天上的婚姻中；还有一个原因是，他们对婚姻只有污秽的想法。一提到婚姻，或一想到婚姻，放荡、淫秽，甚至难以启齿的事就会立刻涌入他们的脑海。同样，当天使们谈论善与真时，这种人就会想到相反的事。因为死后，诸如他们在世时所拥有的一切情感及其衍生的思维都会留在他们身上。行淫者一心想着破坏社会，其中许多人很残忍（参看<a href="824.htm">824</a>节），因而发自内心反对仁爱和怜悯；他们也会对别人幸灾乐祸，渴望夺走每个人的东西，并且只要够胆就会这么做。其快乐就是破坏友谊、制造仇恨。至于他们的宗教信仰，他们声称，他们承认一位宇宙的创造者和天命（不过，只是普遍的天命），也承认因信得救；并且相信比起其他人，他们不会遇到更糟糕的事。但在来世，当其内在本性受到检查时，他们甚至不相信自己曾说过的事；他们不思想宇宙的创造者，反而思想自然界；不思想普遍天命，反而根本什么也不想；并且丝毫不思想信仰。这一切都是如此，因为行淫者完全违背善与真。谁都能判断出，这种人怎么可能进入天堂。</p>

As adulteries are contrary to conjugial love, adulterers cannot be in heaven with the angels; for the reason also that they are in what is contrary to good and truth, and thus are not in the heavenly 
marriage; and also because they have none but filthy ideas respecting marriage. When marriage is merely mentioned, or the idea of it occurs, instantly in their ideas are things lascivious, obscene, nay, 
unmentionable. It is the same when the angels are speaking about good and truth: such persons then think things that are opposite; for all affections and the derivative thoughts remain with a man 
after death, such as they had been in the world. Adulterers are in the desire of destroying society; many of them are cruel (n. 824), and thus in heart they are opposed to charity and mercy; laughing 
at the miseries of others; wishing to take away from everyone what is his; and doing this as far as they dare. Their delight is to destroy friendships, and to bring about enmities. Their religious profession 
is that they acknowledge a Creator of the universe and a Providence-but only a universal one-and salvation by faith, and believe that nothing worse can be done to them than to others. But when 
they are examined as to what they are at heart, which is done in the other life, they do not believe even what they have professed; but instead of the creator of the universe they think of nature; instead 
of a universal Providence, they think of none; and they think nothing of faith. All this is so, because adulteries are wholly contrary to good and truth. Judge then how such can be in heaven. </p>

Since all adultery is contrary to conjugial love, adulterers cannot be with angels in heaven. Another reason why they cannot be with them there is that things contrary to good and truth exist in them 
and so not the heavenly marriage; and a further reason is that they have none but filthy ideas regarding marriage. At the mere mention of marriage, or the occurrence of the idea, things that are licentious, 
obscene, and indeed unspeakable instantly enter their ideas. Similarly when the angels are talking about what is good and true, such people think things that are contrary. For all the affections 
and all the thoughts derived from these affections remain with a person after death such as they have been in the world. Adulterers have it in mind to destroy society, and many of them are cruel, see <a href="824.htm">824</a>; thus at heart they are opposed to charity and mercy, they laugh at others' misfortunes, and desire to take away from everyone what belongs to him, which they do insofar as they dare. It gives 
them pleasure to destroy friendships and to create enmities. As regards their religious convictions, they say that they acknowledge the creator of the universe; also a providence, though only a universal 
providence; salvation by faith; and that nothing worse can happen to them than to anyone else. But when examined as to what they really are at heart, which examination takes place in the next life, 
they do not believe even the things which they say they do. Instead of a creator of the universe they think of nature; instead of a universal providence they have no thought of any at all; and of faith 
they think nothing. All this is so because all adultery is utterly contrary to what is good and true. How such persons can possibly enter heaven, anyone is able to judge for himself. </p>

Quia adulteria sunt contraria amori conjugiali, adulteri non possunt esse cum angelis in caelo, tum quia in contrariis bono et vero sunt et sic non in conjugio caelesti, tum quia de conjugio non nisi 
quam spurcas ideas habent; cum modo nominatur conjugium, aut ejus idea obvenit, ilico in eorum ideis sunt lasciva, obscena, immo nefanda; (m)similiter cum de bono et vero angelis est sermo, tunc tales 
cogitant contra illa;(n) omnes enim affectiones et cogitationes inde {1}, (o)quales fuerunt in mundo, remanent homini (o)post mortem.  Adulteri sunt animo destruendi societates {2}, plures (o)eorum 
sunt crudeles, {3} n. 824, ita {4} corde contra charitatem {5} et misericordiam, ridentes ad aliorum miserias, cuique sua auferre volunt (o)et faciunt quantum audent; oblectamentum iis es destruere amicitias 
et struere inimicitias; religiosum eorum est, quod dicant agnoscere creatorem universi, et providentiam sed modo universalem, et ex fide salvationem, (c)ac quod iis non possit pejus fieri quam 
aliis; sed cum explorantur quales sunt corde, quod fit in altera vita, ne illa quidem credunt, verum pro creatore universi naturam, pro universali {6} providentia nullam, de fide nihil cogitant; haec 
omnia quia adulteria sunt prorsus contra bonum et verum; inde quomodo in caelum venire possint, quisque judicare potest. 	@1 i quae.$ 	@2 Qui adulteri sunt, etiam sunt animo destruendi societates,
