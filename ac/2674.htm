<h3 align="center" class="ired">属天的奥秘 第2674节</h3>
<h4 align="center"></h4><p><strong>2674.</strong>“拿饼和一皮袋水”表良善与真理。这从“饼”和“水”的含义清楚可知：“饼”是指属天之物或良善（参看<a href="276.htm">276</a>，<a href="680.htm">680</a>，<a href="2165.htm">2165</a>节）；“水”是指属灵之物或真理（参看<a href="28.htm">28</a>，<a href="680.htm">680</a>，<a href="739.htm">739</a>节）。经上之所以说“一皮袋水”，是因为他们一开始被赋予了极少量的真理，也就是说，和他们所能够接受的那样多，“搭在她肩上”这句话就表示这种接受能力（<a href="2676.htm">2676</a>节）。谁都能从以下事实看出，这些历史细节蕴含奥秘：即富有牛羊，也富有金银的亚伯拉罕只用一些饼和水就把给他生了一个儿子的使女和他所深爱的孩子以实玛利打发走了。他也能预见到，一旦这些饼和水用完了，他们就会死亡。事实上，若非天使来帮助他们，这种情形早就发生了。而且，关于饼和一皮袋水，以及它们被搭在她的肩上这些细节并非真的那么重要，以至于被提及。但这事的确发生了，并且被记载下来，因为这些细节体现并表示那些正变得属灵之人的最初状态，他们一开始被赋予了一些良善和一些真理，但只有极少量；后来，他们的水用尽了，就在这时，他们便得到主的帮助。</p>

<p align="center"><b>Potts(1905-1910) 2674</b></p><p><b>2674.</b>
And he took bread and a bottle of water. That this signifies good and truth, is evident from the signification of "bread," as being what is celestial, or good (see n. 276, 680, 2165); and from the signification 
of "water," as being what is spiritual, or truth (see n. 28, 680, 739). It is said a "bottle of water," because it is very little truth with which they are gifted in the beginning; as much 
that is to say as they are able to receive, which is signified by his "putting it on her shoulder" (n. 2676). Everyone can see that these historic statements involve arcana, from the fact that Abraham, 
who was rich in flock and herd, and also in gold and silver, sent away in this manner his handmaid by whom he had a son, and the boy Ishmael whom he much loved, giving them only bread [and water]. 
He could also foresee that when these were consumed they would die; and this would have come to pass if they had not received help from the angel. And besides, these things respecting the bread and the 
bottle of water, and their being put on her shoulder, are not of so much importance as to be narrated. But still it was so done, and was related because these things involve and signify the first state 
of those who are becoming spiritual-to whom in the beginning something of good and something of truth, and indeed but little, is imparted-and afterwards that the water fails them, and they then receive 
help from the Lord. </p>

<p align="center"><b>Elliott(1983-1999) 2674</b></p><p><b>2674.</b>
'And he took bread and a flask of water' means good and truth. This is clear from the meaning of 'bread' as that which is celestial, or good, dealt with in <a href="276.htm">276</a>, <a href="680.htm">680</a>, <a href="2165.htm">2165</a>, and from the meaning of 'water' 
as that which is spiritual, or truth, dealt with in <a href="28.htm">28</a>, <a href="680.htm">680</a>, <a href="739.htm">739</a>. The expression 'a flask of water' is used because it is a very small amount of truth that people are granted to begin with, that 
is to say, as much as they are able to receive at that time - that capacity to receive being meant by the words 'he put them on her shoulder', <a href="2676.htm">2676</a>. Anyone may see that these historical details embody 
arcana from the fact that Abraham, who was rich in flocks and herds, also in silver and gold, sent away his servant-girl who had borne his son, and the boy Ishmael whom he loved much, with no more than 
some bread and some water in a flask. He could also foresee that they would die once they had used these up, which would indeed have happened if the angel had not come to their aid. What is more, these 
details regarding the bread and the flask of water, and their being placed on her shoulder, are not really important enough to be mentioned. But this incident did in fact take place, and it has been 
recorded because these details embody and mean the first state of those who are becoming spiritual, to whom to begin with some good and some truth, and indeed only a small amount, are supplied; and 
after that their water comes to an end, at which point they receive help from the Lord. </p>

`Et accepit panem, et lagenam aquae': quod significet bonum et verum, constat a significatione `panis' quod sit caeleste seu bonum, de qua n. 276, 680, 2165, et a significatione `aquae' quod sit spirituale 
seu verum, de qua n. 28, 680, 739 dicitur `lagena aquae, quia est perparum veri quo in principio donantur, quantum nempe tunc possunt recipere, quod significatur per quod `posuit super humero 
ejus,' n. 2676.  Quisque videre potest quod historica haec involvant arcana, ex eo quod Abraham qui dives pecore et armento, tum auro et argento, ita ablegaverit ancillam suam ex qua filium habuit, et 
puerum Ismaelem quem multum dilexit, solum dando eis aliquid panis [et aliquid aquae in lagena]; praevidere etiam potuit quod illis consumptis morerentur, quod etiam factum nisi ab angelo tulerint opem; 
et praeterea haec de pane et lagena aquae, et quod illa posita super humero, nec tanti sunt ut memorentur; sed usque ita factum est, ac memoratum, quia involvunt et significant statum primum eorum 
qui spirituales fiunt, quibus in principio aliquid boni et aliquid veri, et quidem parum suppeditatur, et dein quod aqua illis deficiat, et auxilium tunc ferant a Domino. </p>
