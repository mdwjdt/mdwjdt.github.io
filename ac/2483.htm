<h3 align="center" class="ired">属天的奥秘 第2483节</h3>
<h4 align="center"></h4><p><strong>2483.</strong>有一个女人被带回到她在世上企图犯罪时所在的状态；这时，她的想法和她与另一个女人交谈的一切细节都显现出来，如同暴露在光天化日之下。还有一回，一个属塞壬那一伙的女人因坚持否认活在肉身时她就是这种人，故被带回到其肉体记忆的状态；这时，她在世时几乎没人知道的可耻通奸行为被揭露出来，并逐一被数算，几乎有数百次之多；包括她通奸的地方，通奸的对象，以及那时她的图谋。所有这些事以如同在白昼之光下再现的方式被揭露出来；她就这样被判有罪。当有人试图证明自己不是这种人时，这类事就会从记忆中被提取出来。事实上，它们，以及所涉及的一切细节，都会被召唤出来，如同再现。</p>

A certain woman was let into the state in which she had been in the world when she had plotted a misdeed; and then all the details of her thoughts, and of her conversation with another female, came out 
as into clear day. A certain female belonging to the crew of the Sirens, because she persisted in denying that she had been such in the life of the body, was let into the state of her corporeal memory; 
and then her adulteries and shameless deeds, which while she lived had been known to scarcely anyone, were laid open and were recounted in series, almost to hundreds: where she had been; with whom 
she had committed adultery; what she then plotted; and all these as much to the life as if in open day; thus was she convicted. Such things are brought forth when anyone desires to exculpate himself 
from having been such; and indeed to the life, with every circumstance. </p>

A certain woman was returned to the state that had been hers while in the world where she had attempted something criminal. At this point the details of her thoughts and her conversation with another 
woman came out as if in broad daylight. Because on another occasion a certain woman belonging to the horde of sirens persistently denied that she had been such during her lifetime she too was returned 
to the state in which the physical memory is active. At this point her adulterous and disgraceful deeds, which scarcely anyone had known about during her lifetime, were disclosed and recounted one after 
another, virtually hundreds of them - the place where she had been, those with whom she had committed adultery, and what disgraceful deeds she had attempted. All of these things were in this way 
disclosed as if recreated in the light of day, and in this way she was proved guilty. Such things are summoned up from the memory when anybody seeks to acquit himself of having been such. Indeed they 
are summoned as if recreated, with the particular incidents involved. </p>

{1}  Quaedam in statum missa, in quo fuit dum in mundo cum molita facinus, et tunc singula cogitationum et singula colloquii cum alia sicut in claram diem prodibant. Quaedam ex sirenum turba, quia sustinuit 
negare quod talis fuerat in vita corporis, in statum memoriae corporeae missa est, et tunc adulteria et flagitia ejus, quae vix alicui nota fuerunt dum vixit, aperiebantur, et recitabantur in 
serie, paene ad centena, ubinam fuerat, cum quibus adulterata quid tunc molita, et haec omnia ita ad vivum sicut in aperta die, ita convicta: talia producuntur cum quis se exculpare vult quod talis fuerit, 
et quidem ad vivum cum sanguinis circumstantiis. 	@1 A has 2484, 2485, missing 2483; I as here.$ </p>
