<h3 align="center" class="ired">属天的奥秘 第9807节</h3>
<h4 align="center"></h4><p><strong>9807.</strong>“就是他的儿子”表从神性良善发出的神性真理。这从“儿子”的含义清楚可知，“儿子”是指真理（参看<a href="489.htm">489</a>，<a href="491.htm">491</a>，<a href="533.htm">533</a>，<a href="1147.htm">1147</a>，<a href="2623.htm">2623</a>，<a href="2803.htm">2803</a>，<a href="2813.htm">2813</a>，<a href="3373.htm">3373</a>，<a href="3704.htm">3704</a>节），在此是指从主的神性良善发出的神性真理，因为他们是亚伦的儿子，而作为大祭司的亚伦则代表神性良善方面的主，如刚才所示。“儿子”之所以表示真理，是因为就圣言的内义而言，一切都是属灵的；就灵义而言，“儿子”是指那些从主新生，从而拥有源于良善的真理之人，因此就从人抽象出来的意义而言，是指源于良善的真理本身。故这些真理就是圣言中“神的儿子”、“王的众子”、“天国之子”所表示的。他们也是新生或重生之子。此外，与一个重生之人，或从主新生的人同在的真理和良善就像出身于同一个父亲、在一个又宽又长的世系中的众家庭。有些家庭类似儿子和女儿，有些家庭类似孙子和孙女，有些家庭类似女婿和儿媳，因此类似许多不同程度、因而分为许多种类的关系。被如此排列的真理和良善就是“儿子”、“女儿”、“孙子”、“孙女”、“女婿”和“儿媳”，总之，就是各种不同程度、因而各种不同种类的关系在灵义上所表示的。我通过活生生的经历被指示，属灵的世代就以这种次序相继出现。同时，我被告知，与一个重生之人同在的真理和良善就处于这样一种次序，因为天上的天使社群就以这种方式被排列，而与一个人同在的真理和良善则对应于这些社群。因此，其真理和良善拥有这种对应关系的人就是最小形式的天堂（<a href="9279.htm">9279</a>节）。<br />人若知道“儿子”表示真理，“女儿”表示良善，就能明白圣言中的许多奥秘，尤其预言部分的奥秘；否则，这些奥秘就会隐藏起来。例如，他能明白“人子”具体表示什么，主在圣言中经常自称“人子”；“人子”表示从祂的神性人身发出的神性真理，这一点从祂被如此称呼的经文明显看出来。我在此引用这些经文，好同时确认“儿子”表示真理；如约翰福音：<br />群众对耶稣说，你怎么说人子必须被举起来呢？这人子是谁呢？耶稣回答他们说，光在你们中间还有不多的时候，应当趁着有光行走，免得黑暗临到你们；你们应当趁着有光，信从这光，使你们成为光明之子。（约翰福音<a href="http://39-27.cn/约12.34.htm">12:34</a>-<a href="http://39-27.cn/约12.36.htm">36</a>）<br />从这些话明显可知，“人子”与“光明”所表相同；因为当群众问“这人子是谁”时，主回答说，祂就是他们当信从的光。这“光”表示神性真理（参看<a href="9548.htm">9548</a>，<a href="9684.htm">9684</a>节所提到的地方），因此，“人子”也表示神性真理。<br />路加福音：<br />人为人子恨恶你们，你们就有福了。（路加福音<a href="http://39-27.cn/路6.22.htm">6:22</a>）<br />“为人子”是指为从主发出的神性真理的缘故；神性真理就是对主的信和爱的一切；为此而被“恨恶”是“有福的”。同一福音书：<br />日子将到，那时你们渴望看见人子日子中的一天，却不得看见。那时人将要对你们说，看哪，在这里！或说，看哪，在那里！你们不要离去，也不要寻找！（路加福音<a href="http://39-27.cn/路17.22.htm">17:22</a>，<a href="http://39-27.cn/路17.23.htm">23</a>）<br />“渴望看见人子日子中的一天”表示渴望看见真正属神的真理状态之一。此处论述的主题是教会的结束，这时信不复存在，因为没有了仁；在这种时候，一切真正属神的真理都将消亡。由于“人子”表示神之真理，故经上说“那时人将要对你们说，看哪，在这里！或说，看哪，在那里！你们不要寻找”，这话是指着从主发出的神之真理说的，而不是指主自己说的。<br /><br />人子来的时候，在世上找得到信吗？（路加福音<a href="http://39-27.cn/路18.8.htm">18:8</a>）<br />也就是说，当神之真理从天上被揭示时，它不会被人相信。“人子”在此也指神之真理方面的主，或从主发出的神之真理，主的降临就是教会结束时神之真理的揭示。<br />马太福音：<br />闪电从东边发出，直照到西边。人子降临，也要这样。那时，兆头要显现，地上的众支派都要哀哭。他们要看见人子，有能力，有大荣耀，驾着天上的云降临。（马太福音<a href="http://39-27.cn/太24.27.htm">24:27</a>，<a href="http://39-27.cn/太24.30.htm">30</a>）<br />“人子的降临”表示时代完结，也就是教会结束时神之真理的揭示；“那时都要哀哭的地上众支派”是指整体上源于主、因而献给主的信与爱的一切真理与良善；“祂要驾的天上的云”是指圣言的字义；“有能力，有大荣耀”是指内义，圣言的至内层唯独论述主（对这些话进一步的解释，可参看<a href="4060.htm">4060</a>节）。<br />类似的话出现马太福音的别处：<br />我告诉你们，从今以后，你们要看见人子，坐在那权能者的右边，驾着天上的云降临。（马太福音<a href="http://39-27.cn/太26.64.htm">26:64</a>）<br />路加福音：<br />从今以后，人子要坐在神权能的右手边。（路加福音<a href="http://39-27.cn/路22.69.htm">22:69</a>）<br />“人子”表示从主发出的神性真理；“坐在权能的右手边”表示祂拥有全能，因为神性良善通过神性真理拥有全能；经上说“从今以后，你们要看见人子”表示当主在世征服地狱，使地狱和天堂里的一切恢复秩序，那些以信和爱接受祂的人由此能得到拯救时，神性真理将处于自己的全能之中（参看<a href="9715.htm">9715</a>节）。“坐在右手边”表示全能（参看<a href="3387.htm">3387</a>，<a href="4592.htm">4592</a>，<a href="4933.htm">4933</a>e，<a href="7518.htm">7518</a>，<a href="8281.htm">8281</a>，<a href="9133.htm">9133</a>节）；良善通过真理拥有一切能力（参看<a href="6344.htm">6344</a>，<a href="6423.htm">6423</a>，<a href="8304.htm">8304</a>，<a href="9327.htm">9327</a>，<a href="9410.htm">9410</a>，<a href="9639.htm">9639</a>，<a href="9643.htm">9643</a>节）；神性能力本身在于神性真理（<a href="6948.htm">6948</a>节）；“人子所驾的云”，也就是将要“降临”的神性真理是指文字上的圣言（参看创世记18章序言，<a href="4060.htm">4060</a>，<a href="4391.htm">4391</a>，<a href="5922.htm">5922</a>，<a href="6343.htm">6343</a>，<a href="6752.htm">6752</a>，<a href="8443.htm">8443</a>，<a href="8781.htm">8781</a>节）；“荣耀”是指神性真理本身，就是诸如存在于圣言的内义中的那种（参看创世记18章，<a href="4809.htm">4809</a>，<a href="5922.htm">5922</a>，<a href="8267.htm">8267</a>，<a href="9429.htm">9429</a>节）。<br />由此可见下面这些话表示什么：<br />我又观看，见有一片白云，云上坐着一位好像人子，头上戴着金冠冕。（启示录<a href="http://39-27.cn/启14.14.htm">14:14</a>）<br />但以理书：<br />我在夜间的异象中观看，见有一位像人子的，驾着天云而来。（但以理书<a href="http://39-27.cn/但7.13.htm">7:13</a>）<br />约翰福音：<br />父赐给祂行审判的权柄，因为祂是人子。（约翰福音<a href="http://39-27.cn/约5.27.htm">5:27</a>）<br />一切审判皆通过真理来行使，或说行审判的基础就是真理，这解释了为何经上说“赐给主行审判的权柄，因为祂是人子”；如前所述，“人子”是指神性真理；这真理是从“父”发出的，而“父”是指神性良善（<a href="2803.htm">2803</a>，<a href="3704.htm">3704</a>，<a href="7499.htm">7499</a>，<a href="8328.htm">8328</a>，<a href="8897.htm">8897</a>节）。“行审判”取决于神性真理，这一事实解释了为何经上说“人子来的时候，要坐在祂荣耀的宝座上” （马太福音<a href="http://39-27.cn/太19.28.htm">19:28</a>；<a href="http://39-27.cn/太25.31.htm">25:31</a>）；“人子要照各人的行为报应各人”（马太福音<a href="http://39-27.cn/太16.27.htm">16:27</a>）。<br />马太福音：<br />那撒好种的就是人子；田地就是世界；好种就是天国之子；稗子就是那恶者之子。（马太福音<a href="http://39-27.cn/太13.37.htm">13:37</a>，<a href="http://39-27.cn/太13.38.htm">38</a>）<br />“好种”是指神之真理，故经上说“那撒好种的就是人子”；“天国之子”是指天堂和教会里的神之真理，因为“（儿）子”是指真理（参看<a href="489.htm">489</a>，<a href="491.htm">491</a>，<a href="533.htm">533</a>，<a href="1147.htm">1147</a>，<a href="2623.htm">2623</a>节），在反面意义上是指虚假，也就是“那恶者之子”；“天国”是指天堂，也指教会。<br />约翰福音：<br />除了从天降下仍旧在天的人子，没有人升过天。（约翰福音<a href="http://39-27.cn/约3.13.htm">3:13</a>）<br />从这些话明显可知，“人子”表示存在于天堂中的神性真理；这真理是从那里降下来的，故会升上去，因为没有人能升入天堂，除非神性真理从天堂降到祂那里；流注是从神起始的，而不是反过来。由于主就是这真理，所以祂自称“在天的人子”。马太福音：<br />人子却没有枕头的地方。（马太福音<a href="http://39-27.cn/太8.20.htm">8:20</a>）<br />此处“人子”表示神性真理；“没有枕头的地方”表示那时任何地方，或任何人那里都没有神性真理的位置。<br />人子将要受害并被处死（马太福音<a href="http://39-27.cn/太17.12.htm">17:12</a>，<a href="http://39-27.cn/太17.23.htm">23</a>；<a href="http://39-27.cn/太20.18.htm">20:18</a>；<a href="http://39-27.cn/太26.2.htm">26:2</a>，<a href="http://39-27.cn/太26.24.htm">24</a>，<a href="http://39-27.cn/太26.45.htm">45</a>；马可福音<a href="http://39-27.cn/可8.31.htm">8:31</a>；<a href="http://39-27.cn/可9.12.htm">9:12</a>，<a href="http://39-27.cn/可9.31.htm">31</a>等），意味着这就是神性真理受到的对待，因此也是主所受到的对待，因为主是神性真理本身，祂自己在下列经文中所教导了这一点：<br />我就是道路、真理、生命。（约翰福音<a href="http://39-27.cn/约14.6.htm">14:6</a>）<br />耶利米书：<br />必无人住在那里，也无人的任何儿子在其中寄居。（耶利米书<a href="http://39-27.cn/耶49.18.htm">49:18</a>，<a href="http://39-27.cn/耶49.33.htm">33</a>）<br />耶利米书：<br />无人居住在城邑，无人的任何儿子经过它们。（耶利米书<a href="http://39-27.cn/耶51.43.htm">51:43</a>）<br />人若不不知道圣言的灵义，就会以为此处的“城”是指城市，“人”和“人的儿子”是指一个人和一个儿子；并且城市变得如此荒凉，以至于将无人住在那里；但就真理的教义而言，这些话描述的是教会的状态；因为“城”是指教会的教义事物（<a href="402.htm">402</a>，<a href="2449.htm">2449</a>，<a href="3216.htm">3216</a>，<a href="4492.htm">4492</a>，<a href="4493.htm">4493</a>节）；“人”是指与良善结合的教会的真理本身（<a href="3134.htm">3134</a>，<a href="7716.htm">7716</a>，<a href="9007.htm">9007</a>节）；“人的儿子”因此表示真理。<br />由于“人子”表示从主发出的神性真理，而神性真理也通过先知被揭示，所以先知也被称为“人的儿子”（如但以理书<a href="http://39-27.cn/但8.17.htm">8:17</a>；以西结书<a href="http://39-27.cn/结2.1.htm">2:1</a>，<a href="http://39-27.cn/结2.3.htm">3</a>，<a href="http://39-27.cn/结2.6.htm">6</a>，<a href="http://39-27.cn/结2.8.htm">8</a>；<a href="http://39-27.cn/结3.1.htm">3:1</a>，<a href="http://39-27.cn/结3.3.htm">3</a>，<a href="http://39-27.cn/结3.4.htm">4</a>，<a href="http://39-27.cn/结3.10.htm">10</a>，<a href="http://39-27.cn/结3.17.htm">17</a>，<a href="http://39-27.cn/结3.25.htm">25</a>；<a href="http://39-27.cn/结4.1.htm">4:1</a>，<a href="http://39-27.cn/结4.16.htm">16</a>；<a href="http://39-27.cn/结8.5.htm">8:5</a>，<a href="http://39-27.cn/结8.6.htm">6</a>，<a href="http://39-27.cn/结8.8.htm">8</a>，<a href="http://39-27.cn/结8.12.htm">12</a>，<a href="http://39-27.cn/结8.15.htm">15</a>；<a href="http://39-27.cn/结12.2.htm">12:2</a>，<a href="http://39-27.cn/结12.3.htm">3</a>，<a href="http://39-27.cn/结12.9.htm">9</a>，<a href="http://39-27.cn/结12.18.htm">18</a>，<a href="http://39-27.cn/结12.22.htm">22</a>，<a href="http://39-27.cn/结12.27.htm">27</a>；以及其它许多经文）。<br />在圣言中，大多数表述也有一个反面意义，“人的儿子”的含义也是如此，“人的儿子”在反面意义上是指与真理对立的虚假，如以赛亚书：<br />你是谁，竟怕那必死的人，怕那要得草的人的儿子？（以赛亚书<a href="http://39-27.cn/赛51.12.htm">51:12</a>）<br />“得草的人的儿子”是指产生虚假的记忆知识。诗篇：<br />你们不要倚靠首领，不要倚靠人的儿子，他没有救恩。（诗篇<a href="http://39-27.cn/诗146.3.htm">146:3</a>）<br />“首领”是指首要真理（<a href="2089.htm">2089</a>，<a href="5044.htm">5044</a>节），因而在反面意义上是指首要虚假；而“人的儿子”是指虚假本身。</p>

And his sons. That this signifies the Divine truth that proceeds from the Divine good, is evident from the signification of "sons," as being truths (see n. 489, 491, 533, 1147, 2623, 2803, 2813, 3373, 
3704), here the Divine truth that proceeds from the Lord's Divine good, because they were the sons of Aaron, and by Aaron as high-priest was represented the Lord as to Divine good (as has been shown 
just above). That "sons" denote truths, is because all things in the internal sense of the Word are spiritual; and in the spiritual sense "sons" denote those who are born anew from the Lord, thus who 
are in truths from good, consequently abstractedly from persons, the truths themselves which are from good. These therefore are what are meant in the Word by "the sons of God," "the sons of a king," 
and "the sons of the kingdom." They are also "the sons of the new birth," or regeneration. Moreover, the truths and goods with a regenerated man, or one born anew from the Lord, are exactly like families 
in a large and long series from one father. There are those which bear relation to sons and daughters, to grandsons and granddaughters, to sons-in-law and daughters-in-law, and thus to relationships 
of many degrees, and therefore of many kinds. Truths and goods thus arranged are what in the spiritual sense are "sons," "daughters," "grandsons," "granddaughters," "sons-in-law," "daughters-in-law," 
in a word, relations of various degrees, and consequently of various kinds. That spiritual generations are in such an order has been shown by living experience, and at the same time it was said that 
the truths and goods with a regenerate man are in such an order for the reason that the angelic societies in heaven are in the same, and the truths and goods with man correspond to these societies; 
wherefore also the man whose truths and goods are in such a correspondence is a heaven in the least form. [2] Anyone who knows that by "sons" are signified truths, and by "daughters" goods, can see many 
arcana in the Word, especially in the prophetic Word, that otherwise would be hidden; as also what is meant in particular by "the Son of man," which the Lord often calls Himself in the Word. That 
the Divine truth which proceeds from His Divine Human is meant, is evident from the passages in which He is so named, and which may be here cited for the purpose of confirming at the same time that a 
"son" denotes truth; as in John: </p>
<p>     The crowd said unto Jesus, How sayest Thou, the Son of man must be exalted? Who is this Son of man? Jesus answered them, Yet a little while is the light with you. 
Walk while ye have the light, lest darkness take you. While ye have the light, believe in the light, that ye may be sons of light (John 12:34-36). From these words it is evident that by "the Son of 
man" is signified the like as by "the light," for when they inquired, Who is this Son of man? the Lord answered that He was the light in which they should believe (that this "light" denotes the Divine 
truth, see the places cited in n. 9548, 9684); thus it also denotes the Son of man.  [3] In Luke: </p>
<p>     Blessed are ye when men shall hate you for the Son of man's sake (Luke 6:22); </p>
<p>where "for the 
Son of man's sake" denotes for the sake of the Divine truth which proceeds from the Lord; Divine truth is everything of faith in, and of love to, the Lord, and "being hated for the sake of this" is "blessedness." 
Again: </p>
<p>     The days will come when ye shall desire to see one of the days of the Son of man, but ye shall not see it. Then they shall say unto you, Lo here! or Lo there! go not away, nor 
make search (Luke 17:22, 23); </p>
<p>"to desire to see one of the days of the Son of man" denotes to see one of the states of Divine truth which is genuine. The subject here treated of is the end of the 
church, when there is no longer any faith, because no charity; at which time all genuine truth Divine will perish; and because truth Divine is signified by "the Son of man," therefore it is said, "then 
they shall say, Lo here! or Lo there! search not," which can be said of truth Divine from the Lord, but not of the Lord Himself. [4] Again: </p>
<p>     When the Son of man cometh, shall He find faith on the 
earth? (Luke 18:8); </p>
<p>that is, when truth Divine shall be revealed from heaven, it will not be believed. "The Son of man" here also denotes the Lord as to truth Divine, that is, the truth Divine which 
proceeds from the Lord. "The coming of the Lord" denotes the revelation of truth Divine at the end of the church. [5] In Matthew: </p>
<p>     As the lightning goeth forth from the east, and appeareth even 
unto the west, so shall be the coming of the Son of man. Then shall appear the sign, and then shall all the tribes of the earth wail, and they shall see the Son of man coming in the clouds of heaven 
with power and glory (Matt. 24:27, 30); </p>
<p>"the coming of the Son of man" denotes the revelation of truth Divine in the consummation of the age, that is, at the end of the church; "all the tribes of the 
earth which shall then wail," denote all the truths and goods of faith and of love from the Lord, and thus to the Lord, in the complex; "the clouds of heaven in which He will come," denote the literal 
sense of the Word; "power and glory" denote the internal sense, in the inmost of which the subject treated of is the Lord alone (see the further explication of these words in n. 4060). [6] In like 
manner elsewhere: </p>
<p>     I say unto you, Henceforth ye shall see the Son of man sitting at the right hand of power, and coming upon the clouds of heaven (Matt. 26:64).      From henceforth shall the 
Son of man be sitting at the right hand of the power of God (Luke 22:69). "The Son of man" denotes the Divine truth that proceeds from the Lord; "sitting at the right hand of power" denotes that He 
has omnipotence, for Divine good has omnipotence by means of Divine truth; its being said that "from henceforth they shall see it" signifies that Divine truth was in its omnipotence after the Lord in 
the world had conquered the hells, and had reduced all things therein and in the heavens into order, and that in this way those could be saved who would receive Him in faith and love (see n. 9715). (That 
"sitting at the right hand" denotes omnipotence, see n. 3387, 4592, 4933, 7518, 8281, 9133; that good has all power through truth, see n. 6344, 6423, 8304, 9327, 9410, 9639, 9643; that the Divine 
power itself is Divine truth, n. 6948; that "the clouds in which the Son of man," that is, Divine truth, "will come," denote the Word in the letter, see the preface to Genesis 18; and n. 4060, 4391, 5922, 
6343, 6752, 8443, 8781; and that "glory" denotes the Divine truth itself, such as it is in the internal sense of the Word, see the preface to Genesis 18; and n. 4809, 5922, 8267, 9429.) [7] From 
all this it can now be seen what is signified by these words: </p>
<p>     I saw and behold a white cloud; and on the cloud one sitting like, unto the Son of man, having on His head a golden crown (Rev. 14:14).  
    I saw in the night visions, and behold there came with the clouds of heaven one like unto the Son of man (Dan. 7:13).      The Father gave Him to execute judgment, because He is the Son of 
man (John 5:27). As all judgment is effected from truth, it is said that it was "given to the Lord to execute judgment, because He is the Son of man;" "the Son of man," as before said, denotes the Divine 
truth; the Father from whom it proceeds, denotes the Divine good (n. 2803, 3704, 7499, 8328, 8897). As it pertains to Divine truth to execute judgment, therefore it is said that "when He shall come, 
the Son of man shall sit upon the throne of His glory" (Matt. 19:28; 25:31); and that "the Son of man shall render to everyone according to his deeds" (Matt. 16:27). [8] Further: </p>
<p>     He that soweth 
the good seed is the Son of man; the field is the world; the seed are the sons of the kingdom; the tares are the sons of the evil one (Matt. 13:37, 38); </p>
<p>"the good seed" denotes truth Divine, therefore 
it is said that "the Son of man soweth it;" "the sons of the kingdom" denote truths Divine in heaven and in the church, for a "son" denotes truth (see n. 489, 491, 533, 1147, 2623), and in the 
opposite sense, falsity, which also is "the son of the evil one;" "the kingdom" denotes heaven, and likewise the church. [9] In John: </p>
<p>     No man hath ascended into heaven, but He that came down from 
heaven, the Son of man who is in the heavens (John 3:13); </p>
<p>from this it is evident that "the Son of man" denotes the Divine truth in the heavens; for this comes down, and therefore ascends, because 
no one can ascend into heaven unless Divine truth comes down into him from heaven, because the influx is Divine, and not the other way about. And because the Lord is this truth, therefore He calls Himself 
"the Son of man who is in the heavens." In Matthew: </p>
<p>     The Son of man hath not where to lay His head (Matt. 8:20); </p>
<p>here "the Son of man" denotes the Divine truth; "not having where to lay His 
head," means that Divine truth had no place anywhere, or with any man, at that time. [10] That "the Son of man was to suffer, and to be put to death" (Matt. 17:12, 23; 20:18; 26:2, 24, 45; Mark 8:31; 
9:12, 31; and elsewhere), involves that such was the treatment of Divine truth, and consequently of the Lord, who was the Divine truth itself, as also He Himself teaches in the following passages: </p>
<p> 
    I am the way, and the truth, and the life (John 14:6).      </p>
<p>In Jeremiah:</p>
<p>
No man shall dwell there, neither shall any son of man stay therein (Jer. 49:18, 33).      
 In the cities shall no man dwell, neither shall any son of man pass through them (Jer. 51:43). </p>
<p>Anyone not acquainted with the spiritual sense of the Word will believe that by "cities" are here meant cities, and that by "man" and "the son of 
man" are meant a man and a son; and that the cities would be so desolated that no one would dwell there; but it is the state of the church in respect to the doctrine of truth which is described by these 
words; for "cities" denote the doctrinal things of the church (n. 402, 2449, 3216, 4492, 4493); "a man," the truth itself of the church conjoined with good (n. 3134, 7716, 9007); therefore "the son 
of man" denotes truth. [11] As by "the Son of man" was signified the Divine truth that proceeds from the Lord, therefore also the prophets, through whom it was revealed, were called "sons of man," 
as in Daniel 8:17; in Ezekiel 2:1, 3, 6, 8; 3:1, 3, 4, 10, 17, 25; 4:1, 16; 8:5, 6, 8, 12, 15; 12:2, 3, 9, 18, 22, 27; and in many other passages. [12] As most expressions in the Word have also an opposite 
sense, it is the same with the signification of "the son of man," which in this sense denotes the falsity that is opposite to truth, as in Isaiah: </p>
<p>     Who art thou, that thou art afraid of man 
that dieth, and of the son of man who is given as grass? (Isa. 51:12); </p>
<p>where "the son of man given as grass" denotes the memory-knowledge through which falsity arises. In David: </p>
<p>     Put not your 
trust in princes, in the son of man, in whom there is no salvation (Ps. 146:3); </p>
<p>where "princes" denote primary truths (n. 2089, 5044), thus in the opposite sense, primary falsities; and "the son of man" 
denotes the falsity itself. </p>

<p align="center"><b>Elliott(1983-1999) 9807</b></p><p><b>9807.</b>
'And his sons' means Divine Truth emanating from Divine Good. This is clear from the meaning of 'sons' as truths, dealt with in <a href="489.htm">489</a>, <a href="491.htm">491</a>, <a href="533.htm">533</a>, <a href="1147.htm">1147</a>, <a href="2623.htm">2623</a>, <a href="2803.htm">2803</a>, <a href="2813.htm">2813</a>, <a href="3373.htm">3373</a>, <a href="3704.htm">3704</a>, at this point Divine 
Truth emanating from the Lord's Divine Good, since they were Aaron's sons and Aaron as the high priest represented the Lord in respect of Divine Good, as shown immediately above. Truths are meant by 
'sons' because everything in the internal sense of the Word is spiritual, and 'sons' in the spiritual sense are those who are born anew from the Lord, thus are in possession of truths springing from good, 
so that in the abstract sense - when the persons are not envisaged - 'sons' are the actual truths which spring from good. These truths therefore are what should be understood in the Word by 'the 
sons of God', 'the king's sons', and 'the sons of the kingdom'. They are also the sons of new birth or regeneration. Furthermore the truths and forms of good present with the person who has been regenerated 
or born anew from the Lord are exactly like families in wide and long lines of descent from the one same father. There are those which resemble sons and daughters, those which resemble grandsons 
and granddaughters, those which resemble sons-in-law and daughters-in-law, and so relationships belonging to many degrees, thus to many kinds. Truths and forms of good arranged like this are what sons, 
daughters, grandsons, granddaughters, sons-in-law, daughters-in-law, in short, relatives belonging to different degrees and therefore different kinds, denote in the spiritual sense. I have been shown 
by actual experience that spiritual generations follow one another in that kind of order. And at the same time I have been told that this being so the truths and forms of good with a person who has 
been regenerated follow in that kind of order, since the angelic communities in heaven are arranged in that way and the truths and forms of good present with a person correspond to those communities. 
Therefore also the person whose truths and forms of good possess that kind of correspondence is heaven in the smallest form it takes, <a href="9279.htm">9279</a>.  </p>
<p></p>
<p><b>[2]</b>
 Anyone who knows that truths are meant by 'sons' and 
forms of good by 'daughters' can see many arcana in the Word, especially the prophetical part, which would otherwise lie hidden from view. For example he can see what is meant specifically by the Son 
of Man, which the Lord often calls Himself in the Word, namely Divine Truth emanating from His Divine Human, as is clear from the places where that title appears. Let these be quoted, in order that 
at the same time it may be established that 'the Son' means truth, as in John,  </p>
<blockquote>
The crowd said to Jesus, Why do you say, The Son of Man must be lifted up? Who is this Son of Man? Jesus answered them, 
The light is with you for a brief while longer. Walk, as long as you have the light, lest the darkness overtakes you. As long as you have the light believe in the light, that you may be sons of the 
light. <a href="http://bible.gospelcom.net/cgi-bin/bible?passage=John%2012:34-36&amp;version=ESV&amp;interface=print&amp;showfn=yes&amp;showxref">John 12:34-36</a>.  
</blockquote>
<p>From these words it is evident that 'the Son of Man' has the same meaning as 'the light'; for when the crowd asked, 'Who is this Son of Man?' the Lord answered that He was 
'the light' in which they should believe. 'The light' means Divine Truth, see the places referred to in <a href="9548.htm">9548</a>, <a href="9684.htm">9684</a>, and so therefore does 'the Son of Man'.  </p>
<p></p>
<p><b>[3]</b>
 In Luke,  </p>
<blockquote>
Blessed are you when people 
will hate you on account of the Son of Man. <a href="http://bible.gospelcom.net/cgi-bin/bible?passage=Luke%206:22&amp;version=ESV&amp;interface=print&amp;showfn=yes&amp;showxref">Luke 6:22</a>.  
</blockquote>
<p>'On account of the Son of Man' is on account of Divine Truth, which emanates from the Lord. Divine Truth constitutes the all of faith in 
and love to the Lord; and 'being hated' on account of these is blessedness. In the same gospel,  </p>
<blockquote>
The days will come when you will desire to see one of the days of the Son of Man, but you will not 
see. Then they will say to you, Behold here! or Behold there! Do not go away or go in search. <a href="http://bible.gospelcom.net/cgi-bin/bible?passage=Luke%2017:22,%2023&amp;version=ESV&amp;interface=print&amp;showfn=yes&amp;showxref">Luke 17:22, 23</a>.  
</blockquote>
<p>'Desiring to see one of the days of the Son of Man' means desiring to see one of the states 
of truth that is authentically God's. The subject here is the end of the Church, when no faith exists any longer because there is no charity, at which time every truth that is genuinely God's is 
going to perish. And since God's truth is meant by 'the Son of Man' it says, 'Then they will say, Behold here! or Behold there! Do not go in search', which may be said of God's truth emanating from the 
Lord, but not of the Lord Himself.  </p>
<p></p>
<p><b>[4]</b>
 In the same gospel,  </p>
<blockquote>
When the Son of Man comes will He find faith on the earth? <a href="http://bible.gospelcom.net/cgi-bin/bible?passage=Luke%2018:8&amp;version=ESV&amp;interface=print&amp;showfn=yes&amp;showxref">Luke 18:8</a>.  
</blockquote>
<p>That is, when God's truth is revealed from heaven there 
will be no belief in it. Here also 'the Son of Man' is the Lord in respect of God's truth, or God's truth emanating from the Lord, the Lord's coming being the revelation of God's truth at the end of the 
Church.  </p>

 In Matthew,  </p>
<blockquote>
As the lightning comes from the east and is seen as far as the west, so will the coming of the Son of Man be. Then the sign will appear, and then all the tribes of the 
earth will mourn; and they will see the Son of Man coming in the clouds of heaven with power and glory. <a href="http://bible.gospelcom.net/cgi-bin/bible?passage=Matt%2024:27,%2030&amp;version=ESV&amp;interface=print&amp;showfn=yes&amp;showxref">Matt 24:27, 30</a>.  
</blockquote>
<p>'The coming of the Son of Man' stands for the revelation of God's truth 
at the close of the age, that is, at the end of the Church. 'All the tribes of the earth' who will mourn then are all the truths and forms of the good of faith and love in their entirety that are derived 
from the Lord and so are offered to the Lord. 'The clouds of heaven' in which He is going to come are the literal sense of the Word, 'power and glory' being the internal sense, the subject of which 
at its inmost level is the Lord alone. For further explanation of these matters, see <a href="4060.htm">4060</a>.  </p>

<p>'The Son of Man' stands for Divine Truth emanating from the Lord. 'Sitting at the right hand of power' stands for the reality that in Him there is almighty power; for Divine Good exercises 
its almighty power through Divine Truth. The declaration that 'hereafter they would see this' means that Divine Truth would be in its almighty power, when the Lord in the world had overcome the hells

</blockquote>
<p>The basis on which all judgement is executed is truth, and this explains why it says that [authority] to execute judgement has been given to the Lord because He is the Son of Man. 'The Son of Man',

<p>'The good seed' is God's truth,

<p>From these words it is evident that 'the Son of Man' means Divine Truth present in the heavens. This Truth comes down from there and then goes up, 
for no one can go up into heaven unless Divine Truth has come down into Him from heaven; the flow starts from God, not from the opposite direction. And since the Lord is that Truth He calls Himself 'the 
Son of Man who is in the heavens'. In Matthew,  </p>

nominatur; quae adducere licet, ut simul confirmetur, quod `Filius' sit verum, ut apud Johannem, 	Turba dixit ad Jesum, Quomodo Tu dicis, Oportet exaltari Filium hominis? quis est hic Filius hominis? 
respondit illis Jesus, Adhuc breve tempus lux vobiscum est, ambulate quousque lucem habetis, ne tenebrae vos apprehendant; quousque lucem habetis, credite in lucem, ut filii lucis sitis, xii 34-36; </p>
<p>ex 
his patet quod per `Filium hominis' simile quod per `lucem' significetur, nam cum quaerebant, Quis hic Filius hominis? respondit Dominus quod Ipse esset lux in quam crederent; quod lux sit Divinum 
Verum, videantur citata, n. 9548, 9684; ita quoque Filius (x)hominis: 3 apud Lucam, 	Beati quando odio habebunt vos homines propter Filium hominis, vi 22; </p>
<p>propter Filium hominis' est propter Divinum 
Verum, quod procedit a Domino; Divinum {13} Verum est omne fidei et amoris in Dominum propter illa `odio haberi' est beatitudo: apud eundem, 	Venient dies cum desiderabitis unum dierum Filii hominis 
videre, sed non videbitis; tunc (x)dicent vobis, Ecce hic aut ecce illic; ne abite nec investigate, xvii 22; </p>
<p>`desiderare unum dierum Filii hominis videre' {14}est unum statuum veri Divini quod genuinum; 
agitur ibi de fine Ecclesiae, quando nulla amplius fides quia nulla charitas, quo tempore periturum omne genuinum verum Divinum; et quia verum Divinum significatur per `Filium hominis,' ideo dicitur, 
`tunc dicent, Ecce hic aut ecce illic; ne investigate' quod de vero Divino a Domino, non autem de Ipso Domino 4 {15} dici potest: apud eundem, 	Filius hominis veniens num inveniet fidem super 
terra? xviii 8; </p>
<p>{14}hoc est, cum (t)verum Divinum e caelo revelabitur, quod non credetur `Filius hominis' etiam hic est Dominus quoad (t)verum Divinum seu (t)verum Divinum procedens a Domino; adventus 
Domini est 5 revelatio (t)veri Divini in fine Ecclesiae: apud Matthaeum, 	Sicut fulgur exit ab oriente, et apparet usque ad occidentem, ita erit adventus Filii hominis: tunc apparebit signum; et tunc 
plangent omnes tribus terrae, et videbunt Filium hominis venientem in nubibus caeli cum virtute et gloria, xxiv 27, 30; </p>
<p>`adventus Filii hominis' pro revelatione (t)veri Divini in consummatione saeculi, 
hoc est, in fine Ecclesiae, `omnes tribus terrae quae tunc plangent' sunt omnia vera et bona fidei et amoris a Domino sic in Dominum in complexu, `nubes caeli, in {16}quibus venturus' est sensus 
{17}litteralis Verbi, `virtus et gloria' est sensus internus, in quo sensu intime agitur de solo Domino; porro videantur illa explicata 6 n. 4060: similiter alibi apud eundem, Dico vobis, Ex nunc videbitis 
Filium hominis sedentem ex dextris potentiae, et venientem super nubibus caeli, xxvi 64: </p>
<p>et apud Lucam, 	Ex hoc nunc erit Filius hominis sedens a dextris virtutis Dei, (x)xxii 69; </p>
<p>`Filius hominis' 
pro Divino Vero procedente (c)a Domino, `sedere a dextris potentiae' pro quod {18}Ipsi omnipotentia, nam Divino Bono est omnipotentia per Divinum Verum; (m)quod dicatur quod `ex nunc id visuri 
essent' significat quod Divinum Verum in sua omnipotentia esset cum Dominus in mundo vicerat inferna, ac omnia ibi et in caelis in ordinem redegerat; et quod sic salvari possent qui Ipsum fide et amore 
{19}reciperent, videatur n. 9715;(n) quod `sedere a dextris' {20}sit omnipotentia, videatur n. 3387, 4592, 4933 fin., 7518, 8281, 9133, quod omnis potentia boni sit per verum, n. 6344, (x)6423, 8304, 
9327, 9410, 9639, 9643, quod ipsa potentia Divina sit Divinum Verum, n. 6948; `nubes in quibus venturus Filius hominis,' hoc est, Divinum Verum, quod {21}sint Verbum in littera, Praefatio ad Gen. xviii, 
n. 4060, 4391, 5922, 6343, 6752, 8443, 8781, et quod `gloria' sit ipsum Divinum Verum quale in sensu Verbi interno, Praefatio ad Gen. xviii, n. 4809, 5922, (x)8267, 9429. 	Ex his nunc constare 
potest quid significatur per haec in Apocalypsi, 7  	Vidi cum ecce nubes alba, et super nube sedens similis Filio hominis, habens super capite suo coronam auream, xiv 14: </p>
<p>et apud Danielem, 	Videns 
fui in visionibus noctis, et ecce cum nubibus caelorum sicut Filius hominis venit, vii 13: </p>
<p>apud Johannem, 	Pater dedit Ipsi etiam judicium faciendi, quia Filius hominis est, v 27; </p>
<p>{22}quoniam omne 
judicium fit ex vero, ideo dicitur quod datum {23}Domino judicium facere quia Filius hominis est; `Filius hominis' {24} est, ut dictum, Divinum Verum, `Pater' a Quo id procedit, est Divinum Bonum, n. 
2803, 3704, 7499, 8328, 8897; quia Divino Vero est `judicium facere,' ideo dicitur quod 	Cum venturus Filius hominis, sedebit super throno gloria Suae, Matth. xix 28, xxv 31: </p>
<p>et quod 	Filius hominis 
reddet unicuique secundum facta sua, {25}xvi 27: </p>
<p>8 apud Matthaeum, 	Qui seminat bonum semen est Filius hominis, ager est mundus semen sunt filii regni, zizania sunt filii mali, xiii 37, 38; </p>
<p>`bonum 
semen' est verum Divinum, ideo dicitur quod `Filius hominis' id seminet; `filii regni' sunt vera Divina in caelo et in Ecclesia, `filius' enim est verum, n. 489, 491, 533, 1147, 2623, ac in opposito 
sensu falsum, quod etiam est `filius mali'; {26} `regnum' est caelum, ut et 9 Ecclesia: apud Johannem, 	Nemo ascendit in caelum nisi qui e caelo descendit, Filii hominis qui in caelis est, iii 13; </p>
<p>quod 
`Filius hominis' sit Divinum Verum in caelis, inde patet; nam hoc descendit et sic ascendit, nemo enim ascendere potest in caelum nisi Divinum Verum in illum descenderit e caelo, nam influxus est 
Divinum non autem vicissim; quia Dominus id verum est, ideo (t)Se vocat `Filium hominis qui in caelis': apud Matthaeum, 	Filius hominis non habet ubi caput inclinet, viii 20; </p>
<p>`Filius hominis' pro Divino 
Vero, `non habere ubi caput inclinet' pro quod non locum ullibi, seu apud ullum hominem eo tempore. 	10 Quod Filius hominis passurus sit, et {27}occideretur, Matth. xvii 12, 22, (x)xx 18, xxvi 
2, 24, 45; Marc. viii 31, ix 12, 31; et alibi, involvit quod ita cum Divino Vero actum sit, proinde cum Domino, Qui ipsum Divinum {28}Verum erat, quod etiam Ipse dicit apud Johannem, 	Ego sum via, et 
veritas, et vita, xiv 6: </p>
<p>apud Jeremiam, 	Non habitabit ibi vir, nec commorabitur in ea Filius homini xlix 18, 33: </p>
<p>et apud eundem, 	In urbibus non habitabit vir ullus, neque {29}transibit per eas 
Filius hominis, li 43; </p>
<p>qui non scit Verbi sensum spiritualem, credet quod per `urbes' hic intelligantur urbes, et per `virum' perque `filium hominis' vir et {30} filius; et quod urbes sic desolarentur 
ut nullus ibi; sed est status Ecclesiae quoad doctrinam veri qui per illa describitur; `urbes' enim sunt doctrinalia Ecclesiae, videatur n. 432, (x)2449, 3216, 4492, 4493, `vir' est ipsum ejus verum 
conjunctum bono, n. 3134, 7716, 9007, ita `filius hominis' est verum {31}. 	Quia per `filium hominis' significabatur Divinum Verum procedens 11 a Domino, ideo {32}quoque prophetae, per quos id revelabatur, 
vocabantur filii hominis, prout Daniel viii 17 ibi; et Ezechiel ii 1, 3, 6, 8, iii 1,3,4, 10, 17, 25, iv i, 16, viii 5, 6, 8, 12, 15, xii 2, 3, 9, 18, 22, 27; et pluries alibi. 	Sicut pleraque 
in Verbo sensum etiam oppositum habent, ita 12 quoque significatio filii hominis, qui in eo sensu est falsum oppositum vero, ut apud Esaiam, 	Quid tu quod times {33} ab homine, moritur, et a filio 
hominis, gramen datur, li 12; </p>
<p>`gramen datum filio hominis' est scientificum per quod falsum: apud Davidem, 	Ne confidite in principibus, in filio hominis, cui non salus, Ps. cxlvi 3; </p>
<p>`principes' sunt 
primaria vera, n. 2089, 5044, ita in opposito sensu primaria falsa, et `filius hominis' est ipsum falsum. @1 verum$ @2 repraesentatur$ @3 prout$ @4 filios Regni, filios Dei, et filios Regis$ @5
