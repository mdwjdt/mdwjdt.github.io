<h3 align="center" class="ired">属天的奥秘 第10357节</h3>
<h4 align="center"></h4><p><strong>10357</strong>.“因为这是你我之间的证据”表这是那些属教会的人在天堂被认识所用的主要方法。这从“耶和华和以色列人之间的证据”的含义清楚可知，“耶和华和以色列人之间的证据”是表明并见证他们属于教会的东西，因而是他们在天堂被认识，以及与主结合所用的方法。因为那些属教会的人，也就是那些拥有教会在自己里面的人，必须承认主和祂里面的神性。他们必须承认主与天堂的结合，以及天堂与教会之人的结合，一般要承认良善与真理在那个人里面的结合，因为这种结合构成存在于他里面的教会。无论你说存在于一个人里面的教会，还是说存在于他里面的天堂，抑或说存在于他里面的神的国，或说存在于他里面的主，都是一回事；因为教会就是主在地上的天堂，神的国就是天堂，同时也是教会，主是它们存在的源头，事实上是它们存在的总和与实质。</p>

For it is a sign between Me and you. That this signifies that it is the chief thing whereby they who are of the church are known in heaven, is evident from the signification of "a sign between Jehovah 
and the sons of Israel," as being that which indicates and testifies that they are of the church, thus by which they are known in heaven, and also by which they are conjoined with the Lord. For they 
who are of the church, and in whom is the church, must acknowledge the Lord and the Divine in Him, and must acknowledge the conjunction of the Lord with heaven, and also the conjunction of heaven with 
the man of the church, and in general the conjunction of good and truth with him, because this conjunction makes the church with him. Whether you say "the church with man;" or whether you say "heaven 
with him;" or whether you say "the kingdom of God with him;" or whether you say "the Lord with him," it is the same. For the church is the heaven of the Lord on earth, and the kingdom of God is heaven 
and the church together, and the Lord is He from whom these are; nay, who is these. </p>

<p align="center"><b>Elliott(1983-1999) 10357</b></p><p><b>10357.</b>
'For it is a sign between Me and you' means that it is the chief means by which those who belong to the Church are recognized in heaven. This is clear from the meaning of 'a sign between Jehovah and 
the children of Israel' as that which shows and bears witness to the fact that they belong to the Church, and so is the means by which they are recognized in heaven, and also by which they are joined 
to the Lord. For those who belong to the Church, that is, who have the Church within them, must acknowledge the Lord and the Divinity within Him. They must acknowledge the joining together of the Lord 
with heaven, also that of heaven with a person of the Church, and in general the joining together of goodness and truth in that person since this joining together constitutes the Church present in him. 
Whether you say the Church present in a person, or heaven present in him, or the kingdom of God present in him, or the Lord present in him, it all amounts to the same thing; for the Church is the Lord's 
heaven on earth, the kingdom of God is heaven and at the same time the Church, and the Lord is the Source, indeed the Sum and Substance of their existence.  </p>

</p><b>10357.</b>
`Quia signum id inter Me et inter vos': quod significet quod id principale per quod noscantur in caelo illi qui ab Ecclesia, constat ex significatione `signi inter Jehovam et inter filios Israelis' 
quod sit id quod indicat et testatur quod sint ab Ecclesia, ita per quod {1}noscantur in caelo, et quoque per quod conjunguntur Domino; nam qui ab Ecclesia sunt, hoc est, in quibus Ecclesia, agnoscent 
Dominum ac Divinum in Illo, et agnoscent conjunctionem Domini cum caelo, et quoque conjunctionem caeli cum homine {2}Ecclesiae, et in genere conjunctionem boni et veri apud illum, quoniam {3}haec conjunctio 
facit Ecclesiam apud {4}illum. Sive dicas Ecclesiam apud hominem, sive dicas caelum apud illum, sive dicas regnum Dei apud illum, sive dicas Dominum apud illum, idem est, nam Ecclesia est caelum 
Domini in terris; et regnum Dei est caelum et Ecclesia simul, et Dominus est a Quo illa, immo Qui illa. @1 noscantur IT$ @2 in quo Ecclesia$ @3 illa$ @4 hominem$ </p>
