<h4 align="center"></h4><p><strong>907.</strong>创世记8:17．和你在一起凡有血肉的一切野兽，就是飞鸟、牲畜和一切爬在地上的爬行物，你也要带出来，叫它们分散到地上结果，在地上繁殖。<br />“和你在一起凡有血肉的一切野兽”表该教会成员里面活过来的一切。此处和前面一样，“飞鸟”表其觉知之物，“牲畜”表其意愿之物，这二者皆属内在人。“一切爬在地上的爬行物”表外在人中类似性质的相应事物。“你也要带出来”表它们自由的状态。“叫它们分散到地上”表内在人的行为进入外在人。“结果”表良善的增多，“繁殖”表真理的增多。“在地上”表在外在人中。 </p>

Take them out with you, and let them swarm throughout the earth and reproduce and multiply on the earth."<br />Every wild animal that is with you, of all flesh, symbolizes everything that was alive in the people of this church. The bird here as before symbolizes the ideas in their intellect. The beast symbolizes the urges of their will. Both of these belong to the inner self. Every creeping thing creeping on the earth symbolizes the corresponding attributes in the outer self. Take them out with you symbolizes the level of freedom they had. And let them swarm throughout the earth symbolizes the way the inner self acts on the outer. Let them reproduce symbolizes increases in goodness. Let them multiply symbolizes increases in truth. On the earth means in the outer self.<br /><br /><strong>Footnotes:</strong><br />{*1} The following phrases continue from verse <a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_907/bible_king-james-version_genesis_8_16" target=_top>16</a>, quoted at <a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_907/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_903" target=_top>903</a>.

Verse 17. Every wild animal that is with thee of all flesh, as to fowl, and as to beast, and as to every creeping thing that creepeth upon the earth, bring forth with thee, that they may spread themselves 
over the earth, and be fruitful, and multiply upon the earth. "Every wild animal that is with thee of all flesh" signifies all that was made living in the man of this church; "fowl" signifies here 
as before the things of his understanding; "beast" the things of his will, which are both of the internal man; "every creeping thing that creepeth upon the earth" signifies the like corresponding things 
in the external man; "bring forth with thee" signifies their state of freedom; "that they may spread themselves over the earth" signifies the operation of the internal man upon the external; "and 
be fruitful" signifies increasings of good; "and multiply" signifies increasings of truth; "upon the earth" signifies in the external man. </p>

Verse 17 Every wild animal of all flesh that is with you - birds, and beasts, and every creeping thing that creeps over the earth - bring out with you, and let them spread out into the earth and be fruitful, 
and multiply over the earth. </p>
<p>'Every wild animal of all flesh that is with you' means everything that has been made living within the member of this Church. Here, as previously, 'birds' means 
things of his understanding and 'beasts' those of his will, both of which belong to the internal man. 'Every creeping thing that creeps over the earth' means corresponding things of a like nature residing 
with the external man. 'Bring out with you' means their state of freedom. 'And let them spread out into the earth' means the action of the internal man into the external. 'Be fruitful' means increases 
in good, 'and multiply' increases in truth. 'Over the earth' means with the external man. </p>

Vers. 17.  Omnis fera quae tecum de omni carne quoad avem, et quoad bestiam, et quoad omne reptile repens super terra, educ tecum; et diffundant se in terram, et fructificent se, et multiplicentur super 
terra. 'Omnis fera quae tecum de omni carne' significat omne vivificatum apud hominem hujus Ecclesiae: 'avis' significat hic, ut prius, ejus intellectualia, 'bestia' ejus voluntaria, quae ambo sunt 
interni hominis: 'omne reptile repens super terra' significat similia correspondentia apud externum hominem: 'educ tecum' significat statum eorum libertatis: 'et diffundant se in terra' significat operationem 
interni hominis in externum: 'fructificent se' significat incrementa boni: 'et multiplicentur' incrementa veri: 'super terra' significat apud externum hominem. </p>
