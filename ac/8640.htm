From all this it can be seen what the quality of the life of a regenerate person is, that it is a life of faith; and also that it cannot be given to a man until he is in such a state as to be able to 
acknowledge the truths of faith, and insofar as he acknowledges them, to will them.            EXODUS 18 </p>
<p>     1. And Jethro, the priest of Midian, Moses' father-in-law, heard all that God had done 
for Moses, and for Israel His people, in that Jehovah had brought forth Israel out of Egypt.      2. And Jethro, Moses' father-in-law, took Zipporah, Moses' wife, after he had sent her away: </p>
<p>    
 3. And her two sons; of which the name of the one was Gershom; for he said, I have been a sojourner in a strange land: </p>
<p>     4. And the name of the other was Eliezer; Because the God of my father was 
my help, and liberated me from the sword of Pharaoh.      5. And Jethro Moses' father-in-law came, and his sons, and his wife, unto Moses, unto the wilderness where he was encamped at the mount of God.  
    6. And he said unto Moses, I thy father-in-law Jethro am come unto thee, and thy wife, with her two sons with her.      7. And Moses went out to meet his father-in-law, and bowed himself down, 
and kissed him; and they asked a man his companion as to peace; and they came into the tent.      8. And Moses told his father-in-law all that Jehovah had done to Pharaoh and to the Egyptians for 
Israel's sake, all the trouble that found them in the way, and Jehovah rescued them.      9. And Jethro rejoiced over all the good that Jehovah had done to Israel, who rescued them out of the hand of 
the Egyptians.      10. And Jethro said, Blessed be Jehovah, who hath rescued you out of the hand of the Egyptians, and out of the hand of Pharaoh; who rescued His people from under the hand of the 
Egyptians.      11. Now I know that Jehovah is great above all the gods; for the reason that they dealt proudly over them.      12. And Jethro Moses' father-in-law took a burnt-offering and sacrifices 
for God; and Aaron came, and all the elders of Israel, to eat bread with Moses' father-in-law before God.      13. And it was on the morrow, and Moses sat to judge the people, and the people stood 
over Moses from the morning until the evening.      14. And Moses' father-in-law saw all that he did to the people, and he said, What is this word that thou doest to the people? why sittest thou alone, 
and all the people standing over thee from the morning until the evening?      15. And Moses said to his father-in-law, Because the people cometh unto me to inquire of God: </p>
<p>     16. When they have 
a word, it cometh unto me; and I judge between a man and his companion, and I make known the judgments of God, and His laws.      17. And Moses' father-in-law said unto him, The word that thou doest 
is not good.      18. Wearing thou wilt wear away, both thou, and this people that is with thee; because the word is too heavy for thee; thou art not able to do it, thou alone.      19. Now hear 
my voice, I will counsel thee, and God shall be with thee: be thou for the people with God, and bring thou the words unto God: </p>
<p>     20. And do thou teach them the statutes and the laws, and make known 
to them the way wherein they must walk, and the work that they must do.      21. And do thou see out of all the people men of strenuousness, fearing God, men of truth, hating gain; and do thou set 
of them for princes of thousands, princes of hundreds, princes of fifties, and princes of tens: </p>
<p>     22. And let them judge the people in every time; and it shall be, every great word let them bring 
unto thee, and every small word let them judge; and devolve from upon thee, and let them bear with thee.      23. If thou do this word, and God have commanded thee, then thou shalt be able to stand, 
and also all this people shall come upon its place in peace.      24. And Moses hearkened to the voice of his father-in-law, and did all that he had said.      25. And Moses chose men of strenuousness 
out of all Israel, and gave them as heads over the people: princes of thousands, princes of hundreds, princes of fifties, and princes of tens.      26. And they shall judge the people in every time, 
the difficult word they shall bring unto Moses, and every small word they shall judge.      27. And Moses let his father-in-law go, and he went to himself unto his own land. </p>

All this goes to show what the life of a regenerate person is like, that it is a life of faith, and also that it cannot be imparted to a person until he has entered a state in which he can acknowledge 
the truths of faith, and to the extent that he acknowledges them can intend them. </p>

XVIII 	1.  Et audivit Jethro sacerdos Midianis socer Moschis omne quod fecit DEUS Moschi et Israeli populo Suo, quod eduxerit JEHOVAH Israelem ex Aegypto. 	2.  Et accepit Jethro socer Moschis Zipporam 
uxorem Moschis post dimissiones ejus. 	3.  Et duos filios ejus, quorum nomen unius Gerschom, quia dixit, Peregrinus fui in terra aliena. 	4.  Et nomen unius (x)Eliezer, Quia DEUS patris mei in 
auxilio meo, et liberavit me a gladio Pharaonis. 	5.  Et venit Jethro socer Moschis, et filii ejus, et uxor ejus, ad Moschen ad desertum, ubi ille castrametatus montem DEI. 	6.  Et dixit ad Moschen, 
Ego socer tuus Jethro venio ad te, et uxor tua, et duo filii ejus cum illa. 	7.  Et exivit Moscheh obviam socero suo, et incurvavit se, et osculatus illum; et interrogabant vir socium suum ad pacem; 
et venerunt in tentorium. 	8.  Et narravit Moscheh socero suo omne quod fecerat JEHOVAH Pharaoni et Aegyptiis propter causas Israelis; omnem molestiam quae invenit illos in via, et eripuit illos JEHOVAH. 	9. 
 Et gavisus est Jethro super omni bono quod fecit JEHOVAH Israeli, Qui eripuit illum e manu Aegyptiorum. 	10.  Et dixit Jethro, Benedictus JEHOVAH, Qui eripuit vos e manu Aegyptiorum et e 
manu Pharaonis, Qui eripuit populum Suum e sub manu Aegyptiorum. 	11.  Nunc novi quod magnus JEHOVAH prae omnibus diis, quia eapropter quod superbiverint super illos. 	12.  Et accepit Jethro socer 
Moschis holocaustum et sacrificia DEO; et venit Aharon et omnes seniores Israelis ad comedendum panem cum socero Moschis coram DEO. 	13.  Et fuit crastino, et sedit Moscheh ad judicandum populum, et 
stetit populus super Moschen a mane usque ad vesperam. 	14.  Et vidit socer Moschis omne quod ille faciens populo, et dixit, Quodnam verbum hoc quod tu facis populo? quare tu sedes solus tu, et omnis 
populus stans super te a mane usque ad vesperam? 	15.  Et dixit Moscheh socero suo, Quia venit ad me populus ad inquirendum DEUM. 	16.  Cum est illis verbum, venit ad me, et judico inter virum et inter 
socium ejus, et nota facio judicia DEI et leges Ipsius. 	17.  Et dixit socer Moschis ad illum, Non bonum verbum quod tu facis. 	18.  Marcescendo marcesces etiam tu etiam populus hic qui tecum, 
quia grave prae te verbum; non potes facere illud solus tu. 	19.  Nunc audi vocem meam, consulam tibi, et erit DEUS tecum; esto tu populo apud DEUM, et adducas tu verba ad DEUM. 	20.  Et doceas illos 
statuta et leges, et notam facias illis viam ibunt in qua, et opus quod facient. 	21.  {1} Et tu videas ex omni populo viros strenuitatis timentes DEUM, viros veritatis odientes lucrum; et ponas {2}ex 
illis principes millenorum, principes centenorum, principes quinquagenorum, et principes decadum. 	@1 i (visio prophetica) above this v.$ 	@2 Heb      (`alehem) = super illos which A had but altered 
to ex illis cp n. 8696, 8712$ 	22.  Et judicent populum in omni tempore, et erit, omne verbum magnum adducant ad te, et omne verbum parvum judicent illi; et devolve desuper te, et portent tecum. 	23. 
 Si verbum hoc facias, et praeceperit tibi DEUS, et potes consistere; et etiam omnis populus hic super locum suum veniet in pace. 	24.  Et auscultavit Moscheh voci soceri sui, et fecit omne quod 
dixit. 	25.  Et elegit Moscheh viros strenuitatis ab omni Israele, et dedit illos capita super populum, principes millenorum, principes centenorum, principes quinquagenorum, et principes decadum. 	26. 
 Et judicabunt populum in omni tempore, verbum difficile adducent ad Moschen, et omne verbum parvum judicabunt illi. 	27.  Et dimisit Moscheh socerum suum, et ivit sibi ad terram suam. </p>
