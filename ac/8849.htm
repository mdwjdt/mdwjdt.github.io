<h3 align="center" class="ired">属天的奥秘 第8849节</h3>
<h4 align="center"></h4><p><strong>8849.</strong>来自木星的另一个灵人来找我，说他正在寻求独一主，他渴望进入天堂；但他不能，因为他活在肉身时做了一件坏事。我问他是什么坏行为。他说，他从一个同伴那里偷了一件没什么价值的东西，他以为他的同伴会给他；这个行为使他良心不安。由此明显可知，他们在木星过的是哪种生活，无论向谁做了坏事，哪怕只是轻微的坏事，他们也会感到痛苦。因为这个灵人把他所想的从他的星球带来了。</p>

One of the spirits from that earth came to me, saying that he was seeking the One Only Lord, and that he longed to come into heaven; but that he could not, because in the life of the body he had done 
evil. He was asked what evil. He said that he had taken from a companion something which was of little value and which he supposed his companion was going to give him, and that this lay heavy on his 
conscience. From this it was evident what kind of a life they live on that earth, and that it torments them if they do evil to anyone, however slight; for he had brought that thought with him from his earth. </p>

Some other spirit from that planet came to me, saying that he was looking for the one and only Lord and desired to enter heaven, but could not because he had done a bad deed during his lifetime. I asked 
him what that bad deed had been. He said that he had stolen from a companion something that was of no great value, which he had supposed his companion was going to give him, and that this deed was 
weighing on his conscience. This showed me the kind of life people lead on that planet, and that they feel distressed if they do something bad to anyone, even if only slightly bad. For this spirit had 
brought what he thought with him from his planet. </p>

Quidam etiam ex spiritibus ab illa tellure ad me venit dicens quod quaereret unicum Dominum, et desideraret venire in caelum, sed quod non posset, quia in vita corporis malum egerat; (x)quaerebatur 
quid mali; dicebat quod abstulerit (c)ex socio aliquid quod pretii parvi erat, quod autumabat eum sibi daturum, et quod hoc (x)gravaret conscientiam; inde patuit qualem vitam in illa tellure {1}vivunt, 
(c)et quod (x)angat illos si malum, etiamsi leve, alicui faciunt; nam (c)illam cogitationem traxerat secum e tellure. @1 agunt$  </p>
