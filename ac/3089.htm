<h3 align="center" class="ired">属天的奥秘 第3089节</h3>
<h4 align="center"></h4><p><strong>3089.</strong>“请你让我抿一口你瓶子里的一点水”表看看来自这源头的真理能否与它联结。这从“抿”和“水”的含义清楚可知。“抿”是类似“喝”的行为，只是取的量少，因为这是一次调查；“喝”表察觉（参看<a href="3069.htm">3069</a>节），在内义上也表交流并结合，并论及属灵之物，如同“吃”论及属天之物（<a href="2187.htm">2187</a>，<a href="2343.htm">2343</a>节）。“水”是指真理（参看<a href="680.htm">680</a>，<a href="739.htm">739</a>，<a href="2702.htm">2702</a>节）。故此处“请你让我抿一口你瓶子里的一点水”这句话表示看看来自这源头的真理能否被联结起来。“瓶”是指有真理在里面并从中获得真理的接受者（<a href="3068.htm">3068</a>，<a href="3079.htm">3079</a>节）。看看的原因是，对真理的最初情感尚具有来自母亲的某种事物，这种事物要被分离出去（<a href="3040.htm">3040</a>，<a href="3078.htm">3078</a>节）。对即将重生的人来说，情况是这样：他对真理的最初情感极其不洁，因为该情感里面有实现他自己、尘世和天上荣耀的意图和目的的欲望，以及关注他自己，而不是公共利益、主的国度，更不用说主自己的类似事物。这样的情感不可避免地先出现；然而，主会逐渐纯净它，直到最后，虚假与邪恶可以说被移走并被逐到周边；不过，它们仍可充当工具。</p>

Let me I pray sip a little water from thy pitcher. That this signifies inquiry whether anything of truth from this source could be conjoined, is evident from the signification of "sipping," as being 
similar to that of "drinking;" but diminutively, because exploring is implied. (That "to drink", is to perceive may be seen above, n. 3069.) In the internal sense "to drink" also denotes to be communicated 
and to be conjoined, and is predicated of what is spiritual, as "to eat" is predicated of what is celestial (n. 2187, 2343). The same is further evident from the signification of "water," as being 
truth (see n. 680, 739, 2702). Here therefore the words "let me I pray sip a little water from thy pitcher," signify exploring whether anything of truth from this source could be conjoined. The "pitcher" 
is the recipient, in which and out of which is truth (n. 3068, 3079). That there was an exploration is because the first affection of truth was attended with something from the maternal, which 
was to be separated (n. 3040, 3078). With a man about to be regenerated the case is that his first affection of truth is very impure; for there is in it an affection of use and an end for the sake of 
himself, for the sake of the world, for the sake of glory in heaven, and the like, which ends regard himself, but not the community, the Lord's kingdom, and still less the Lord. Such an affection necessarily 
precedes; nevertheless it is successively purified by the Lord, till at last falsities and evils are removed and are cast as it were into the circumference; and yet they had been of service as means. </p>

'Let me sip now a little water from your pitcher' means to see whether it was possible for any truth from that source to be joined to it. This is clear from the meaning of 'sipping' as an activity similar 
to that meant by 'drinking', but taking in only a small amount because it was to be an investigation - for 'drinking' means perceiving, see <a href="3069.htm">3069</a>, and also in the internal sense being communicated 
and joined together, and has reference to what is spiritual just as 'eating' has reference to what is celestial, <a href="2187.htm">2187</a>, <a href="2343.htm">2343</a>; and from the meaning of 'water' as truth, dealt with in <a href="680.htm">680</a>, <a href="739.htm">739</a>, <a href="2702.htm">2702</a>. Here 
therefore 'let me sip now a little water from your pitcher' means an investigation to see whether it was possible for any truth from that source to be joined. 'A pitcher' is a recipient which has 
truth in it and from which truth is obtained, <a href="3068.htm">3068</a>, <a href="3079.htm">3079</a>. The reason for this investigation was that the initial affection for truth also carried with it something from the mother that was to be separated, <a href="3040.htm">3040</a>, <a href="3078.htm">3078</a>. With anyone who is to be regenerated his initial affection for truth is largely impure, for it holds within it the desire to satisfy a purpose and an end that have himself in view, the 
world, glory in heaven, and similar things which regard himself and not the common good, the Lord's kingdom, still less the Lord Himself. Such affection inevitably comes first. Nevertheless the Lord 
purifies it gradually so that at length falsities and evils are removed and banished so to speak to the circumference. But they have nevertheless served as means. </p>

`Sorbere fac me quaeso parum aquae e cado tuo': quod significet num inde aliquid veri conjungi posset, constat ex significatione `sorbere' quod simile sit ac bibere, sed in diminutivo quia explorandum; 
quod `bibere' sit percipere, videatur n. 3069; est quoque `bibere' in sensu interno communicari et conjungi, et praedicatur de spirituali, sicut `comedere' quod praedicatur de caelesti, n. 2187, 2343; 
et ex significatione `aquae' quod sit veram, de qua n. 680, 739, 2702; hic itaque per `sorbere fac me quaeso parum aquae e cado tuo' significatur explorativum num aliquid veri inde conjungi posset; 
cadus {1}est recipiens in quo et e quo verum, n. 3068, 3079.  Quod exploratio inde est quia prima affectio veri etiam aliquid secum habuit ex materno quod separandum, n. 3040, 3078.  Apud hominem regenerandum 
ita se habet, quod prima ejus affectio veri admodum impura sit, inest enim ei affectio usus et finis propter se, propter mundum, propter gloriam in caelo, et similia, quae spectant versus 
se, non autem versus commune, regnum Domini, minus versus Dominum: talis affectio non potest quin praecedat; usque tamen successive illa purificatur a Domino, tandem ut removeantur et conjiciantur falsa 
et mala quasi in peripheriam; {2}inserviverunt usque pro mediis. @1 i enim$ @2 inserviunt$ </p>
