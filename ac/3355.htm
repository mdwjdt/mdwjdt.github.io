<h3 align="center" class="ired">属天的奥秘 第3355节</h3>
<h4 align="center"></h4><p>【节】 3355.就内义而言，“地震”表教会状态的改变。这从“地”和“震（动）”的含义清楚可知：“地”是指教会（<a href="566.htm">566</a>，<a href="662.htm">662</a>，<a href="1066.htm">1066</a>，<a href="1068.htm">1068</a>，<a href="1262.htm">1262</a>，<a href="1733.htm">1733</a>，<a href="1850.htm">1850</a>，<a href="2117.htm">2117</a>，<a href="2118.htm">2118</a>，<a href="2928.htm">2928</a>节）；“震（动）”或移动是指状态的改变，在此是指构成教会的事物，也就是良善与真理的改变。这也可从圣言的其它地方明显看出来，如以赛亚书： <br />躲避恐惧声音的必坠入陷坑；从陷坑中上来的必被网罗缠住。因为高处的水闸都开了，地的根基也震动了。地全然破坏，尽都崩裂，大大地震动了。地要东倒西歪，好像醉酒的人；又摇来摇去，好像茅屋。它的罪过在其上沉重，它必然塌陷，不能复起。到那日，耶和华在高处必惩罚高处的众军，在地面上必惩罚地面上的列王。（以赛亚书<a href="http://39-27.cn/赛24.18.htm">24:18</a>-<a href="http://39-27.cn/赛24.21.htm">21</a>）<br />很明显，在这段经文中，“地”是指教会。因为所论述的主题是教会，当良善与真理不再为人所知时，经上就说它的“根基震动”，而教会本身也“尽都崩裂，大大震动，摇来摇去”。“地面上的列王”是指真理，在此是指将要面临惩罚的虚假。“王”表真理，在反面意义上表虚假（参看<a href="1672.htm">1672</a>，<a href="2015.htm">2015</a>节）；“地面”（ground）和“地”（earth）一样，表教会，不过也有区别（参看<a href="566.htm">566</a>，<a href="1068.htm">1068</a>节）。<br /><br />我必使人比精金还少，使人比俄斐的金更少！因此，在万军之耶和华的震怒中，当祂发烈怒的日子，我必使天震动，使地摇撼，离其本位。（以赛亚书<a href="http://39-27.cn/赛13.12.htm">13:12</a>-<a href="http://39-27.cn/赛13.13.htm">13</a>）<br />此处论述的主题也是审判之日，“地”明显表教会，当它经历状态的改变时，经上说它“离其本位”，“位（置）”或地方表状态（参看<a href="1273.htm">1273</a>-<a href="1275.htm">1275</a>，<a href="1377.htm">1377</a>，<a href="2625.htm">2625</a>，<a href="2837.htm">2837</a>节）。<br />这不是那使大地战抖，使列国震动，使世界如同旷野，使其城邑倾覆的人吗？（以赛亚书<a href="http://39-27.cn/赛14.16.htm">14:16</a>-<a href="http://39-27.cn/赛14.17.htm">17</a>）<br />这论及路西弗。“地”表教会，当人将它的一切归给自己时，经上说他“战抖”。“国”表示教会所接受的真理（参看<a href="1672.htm">1672</a>，<a href="2547.htm">2547</a>节）。<br />以西结书：<br />到那日，就是歌革上来攻击以色列陆地的时候，我的震怒在怒气中升起；我在妒恨和怒火之中说：到那日，以色列的地面上必有大地震。（以西结书<a href="http://39-27.cn/结38.18.htm">38:18</a>-<a href="http://39-27.cn/结38.20.htm">20</a>）<br />“歌革”表已经脱离内在、从而变成偶像崇拜的外在敬拜（<a href="1151.htm">1151</a>节）。“以色列陆地”（Israel's land'）和“以色列的地面”（ground of Israel）表属灵教会，“地震”表其状态的改变。约珥书：<br />地在祂面前震动，天颤抖，日月昏暗，星宿无光。（约珥书<a href="http://39-27.cn/珥2.10.htm">2:10</a>）<br />此处论述的主题也是最后审判之日。“地震动”表教会已改变的状态，“日和月”表爱之善和信之真（<a href="1529.htm">1529</a>，<a href="1530.htm">1530</a>，<a href="2441.htm">2441</a>，<a href="2495.htm">2495</a>节），当良善与真理不再得到承认时，经上就它们“昏暗”。“星宿”表对良善与真理的认知（<a href="2495.htm">2495</a>，<a href="2849.htm">2849</a>节）。诗篇：<br />因祂发怒，地就摇撼震动；山的根基也战抖摇撼。（诗篇<a href="http://39-27.cn/诗18.7.htm">18:7</a>）<br />“地就摇撼震动”表教会状态变得堕落。<br />启示录：<br />揭开第六印的时候，我观看，见大地震发生了，日头变黑像毛布，满月变得像血，天上的星辰坠落于地。（启示录<a href="http://39-27.cn/启6.12.htm">6:12</a>，<a href="http://39-27.cn/启6.13.htm">13</a>）<br />此处“地震，日，月和星辰”的含义和上面约珥书中的一样。<br />正在那时辰，发生了大地震，城就倒塌了十分之一，因地震被杀的人名有七千。（启示录<a href="http://39-27.cn/启11.13.htm">11:13</a>）<br />由所有这些经文明显可知，“地震”无非是指教会状态的改变；就内义而言，“地”是指教会，没有其它含义。由于“地”是指教会，故很明显，将要取代先前的天与地的新天与新地（以赛亚书<a href="http://39-27.cn/赛65.17.htm">65:17</a>；<a href="http://39-27.cn/赛66.22.htm">66:22</a>；启示录<a href="http://39-27.cn/启21.1.htm">21:1</a>）无非是指既内在又外在的新教会（<a href="1733.htm">1733</a>，<a href="1850.htm">1850</a>，<a href="2117.htm">2117</a>，<a href="2118.htm">2118</a>节）。</p>

That in the internal sense an "earthquake" signifies a change in the state of the church, is evident from the signification of "earth," as being the church (n. 566, 662, 1066, 1067, 1262, 1733, 1850, 
2117, 2118, 2928); and from the signification of "quaking," or movement, as being a change of state; here, as to the things of the church, namely, in respect to good and truth. The same is also evident 
from other passages in the Word, as in Isaiah: </p>
<p>     It shall come to pass that he who fleeth from the voice of the dread shall fall into the pit; and he that cometh up out of the midst of the pit 
shall be taken in the snare; for the cataracts from on high were opened, and the foundations of the earth were shaken; in breaking the earth is broken; in moving the earth is moved; reeling the earth 
reeleth like a drunken man, and sways to and fro like a hut; and the transgression thereof is heavy upon it; and it shall fall and not rise again. And it shall come to pass in that day that Jehovah shall 
visit upon the army of the height on high, and upon the kings of the ground upon the ground (Isa. 24:18-21). That in this passage the "earth" is the church, is plainly evident; for it is the church 
that is treated of, whose foundations are said to be "shaken," and itself to be "broken and moved, and to reel and sway to and fro," when good and truth are no longer known. The "kings of the ground" 
are truths; here, falsities, upon which there will be visitation. (That "kings" are truths, and in the opposite sense falsities, see above, n. 1672, 2015; and that "ground," like "earth," denotes the 
church, but with a difference, n. 566, 1068.) [2] Again: </p>
<p>     I will make a man more rare than fine gold, and a man than the gold of Ophir; therefore I will shake the heaven, and the earth shall 
be shaken out of her place; in the indignation of Jehovah of Armies, and in the day of the wrath of His anger (Isa. 13:12-13); </p>
<p>speaking of the day of judgment; and in this passage also "earth" clearly 
denotes the church, which is said to be "shaken out of its place," when it is changed as to state. (That "place" is state may be seen above, n. 1273-1275, 1377, 2625, 2837.) Again: </p>
<p>     Is this the 
man that shaketh the earth, that shaketh kingdoms, that maketh the world as a wilderness, and destroyeth the cities thereof? (Isa. 14:16-17); </p>
<p>speaking of Lucifer; the "earth" denotes the church, which 
he is said to "shake" when man attributes to himself all things of it. (That "kingdoms" are the truths of the church may be seen above, n. 1672, 2547.) [3] In Ezekiel: </p>
<p>     It shall come to pass 
in that day, when Gog cometh upon the land of Israel, that My wrath shall rise in Mine anger; in My zeal and in the fire of My indignation I will speak, Surely in that day there shall be a great earthquake 
upon the ground of Israel (Ezek. 38:18-20); </p>
<p>"Gog" denotes external worship separate from internal, and thus become idolatrous (n. 1151); the "earth" and the "ground of Israel" denote the spiritual 
church; the "earthquake," a change in its state. In Joel: </p>
<p>     The earth quaked before Him, the heavens trembled, the sun and the moon became black, and the stars withdrew their brightness (Joel 
2:10); </p>
<p>where also the subject is the day of the Last Judgment the "earth quaking" denotes a changed state of the church; the "sun and moon," the good of love and its truth (n. 1599, 1530, 2441, 2495), 
which are said to "become black," when goods and truths are no longer acknowledged; the "stars" denote the knowledges of good and truth (n. 2495, 2849). In David: </p>
<p>     The earth was shaken and quaked, 
and the foundations of the mountains trembled and were shaken, because He was wroth (Ps. 18:7); </p>
<p>the "earth shaken and quaking" denotes the state of the church become perverted. [4] In John: </p>
<p>   
  And I beheld when he opened the sixth seal, and lo there was a great earthquake, and the sun became black as sackcloth of hair, and the whole moon became as blood, and the stars of heaven fell unto 
the earth (Rev. 6:12-13); </p>
<p>where the "earthquake, sun, moon, and stars" have a like signification as above in Joel. Again: </p>
<p>     In that hour there was a great earthquake, and the tenth part of the city 
fell; and there were killed in the earthquake names of men seven thousand (Rev. 11:13). From all these passages it is evident that an "earthquake" is nothing else than a change in the state of the 
church; and that in the internal sense the "earth" is nothing else than the church; and as the "earth" is the church, it is evident that by the "new heaven and new earth," which were to succeed in place 
of the former (Isa. 65:17; 66:22; Rev. 21:1), there is signified nothing else than a new church internal and external (n. 1733, 1850, 2117, 2118). </p>

<p align="center"><b>Elliott(1983-1999) 3355</b></p><p><b>3355.</b>
In the internal sense 'an earthquake' is an alteration of the state of the Church. This is clear from the meaning of 'the earth' as the Church, dealt with in <a href="566.htm">566</a>, <a href="662.htm">662</a>, <a href="1066.htm">1066</a>, <a href="1068.htm">1068</a>, <a href="1262.htm">1262</a>, <a href="1733.htm">1733</a>, <a href="1850.htm">1850</a>, <a href="2117.htm">2117</a>, <a href="2118.htm">2118</a>, <a href="2928.htm">2928</a>, and from the meaning of 'a quake' as an alteration of state, here an alteration as regards the things that constitute the Church, namely good and truth. This is also evident from other 
places in the Word, as in Isaiah, </p>
<blockquote>
It will happen, that he who is fleeing from the sound of the terror will fall into the pit, and he who is climbing out of the middle of the pit will be caught in 
the snare, for the floodgates from on high have been opened and the foundations of the earth have been made to tremble, the earth has been utterly shattered. The earth has been made to quake thoroughly, 
the earth staggers like a drunken man, it sways to and fro like a hut, and heavy upon it is its transgression, and it will fall and not rise again. And it will be on that day, that Jehovah will visit 
the host of the height on high and the kings of the ground on the ground. <a href="http://bible.gospelcom.net/cgi-bin/bible?passage=Isa%2024:18-21&amp;version=ESV&amp;interface=print&amp;showfn=yes&amp;showxref">Isa 24:18-21</a>. 
</blockquote>
<p>Here it is guise evident that 'the earth' is the Church, for the subject is a Church whose 'foundations' 
are said to 'have been made to tremble', while the Church itself, having been 'shattered' and 'made to quake', 'staggers' and 'sways to and fro' when good and truth are not known any longer. 'The kings 
of the ground' are truths, in this case falsities, upon which visitation will take place. As regards 'kings' meaning truths and in the contrary sense falsities, see <a href="1672.htm">1672</a>, <a href="2015.htm">2015</a>, and as regards 'the 
ground' being similar in meaning to 'the earth', namely the Church, though there is a difference, see <a href="566.htm">566</a>, <a href="1068.htm">1068</a>. </p>
<p></p>
<p><b>[2]</b>
 In the same prophet, </p>
<blockquote>
I will make a man (homo) more rare than pure gold, and a 
man (homo) than the gold of Ophir. Therefore I will make heaven quake and the earth will quake out of its place, at the wrath of Jehovah Zebaoth and in the day of His fierce anger. <a href="http://bible.gospelcom.net/cgi-bin/bible?passage=Isa%2013:12,%2013&amp;version=ESV&amp;interface=print&amp;showfn=yes&amp;showxref">Isa 13:12, 13</a>. 
</blockquote>
<p>Here 
also, the subject being Judgement Day, 'the earth' plainly stands for the Church which is said to 'quake out of its place' when it undergoes a change of state - 'place' meaning state, see <a href="1273.htm">1273</a>-<a href="1275.htm">1275</a>, 
<a href="1377.htm">1377</a>, <a href="2625.htm">2625</a>, <a href="2837.htm">2837</a>. In the same prophet, </p>
<blockquote>
Is this the man who, making the earth quake, making the kingdoms quake, makes the world into a wilderness and destroys its cities? <a href="http://bible.gospelcom.net/cgi-bin/bible?passage=Isa%2014:16,%2017&amp;version=ESV&amp;interface=print&amp;showfn=yes&amp;showxref">Isa 14:16, 17</a>. 
</blockquote>
<p>This 
refers to Lucifer. 'The earth' stands for the Church, which is said 'to quake' when it lays claim to all things as its own. For 'kingdoms' means the truths accepted by the Church, see <a href="1672.htm">1672</a>, <a href="2547.htm">2547</a>. </p>
<p></p>
<p><b>[3]</b>
In Ezekiel, </p>
<blockquote>
It will be on that day, that Gog will come over the land of Israel. My wrath will come up in My anger and in My zeal. In the fire of My wrath I will say, Surely on that day there will 
be a great earthquake on Israel's ground. <a href="http://bible.gospelcom.net/cgi-bin/bible?passage=Ezek%2038:18-20&amp;version=ESV&amp;interface=print&amp;showfn=yes&amp;showxref">Ezek 38:18-20</a>. 
</blockquote>
<p>'Gog' stands for external worship that has been separated from internal and so made idolatrous, <a href="1151.htm">1151</a>. 'Israel's land' or 'ground' stands 
for the spiritual Church, 'an earthquake' for an alteration of its state. In Joel, </p>
<blockquote>
The earth quaked before Him, the heavens trembled. The sun and the moon were darkened, and the stars withdrew their 
shining. <a href="http://bible.gospelcom.net/cgi-bin/bible?passage=Joel%202:10&amp;version=ESV&amp;interface=print&amp;showfn=yes&amp;showxref">Joel 2:10</a>. 
</blockquote>
<p>This also refers to Judgement Day. 'The earth quaked' stands for an altered state of the Church, 'the sun and moon' for the good of love and the truth of faith, <a href="1529.htm">1529</a>, <a href="1530.htm">1530</a>, 
<a href="2441.htm">2441</a>, <a href="2495.htm">2495</a>, which are said to be 'darkened' when goods and truths are not acknowledged any longer. 'The stars' stands for cognitions of good and truth, <a href="2495.htm">2495</a>, <a href="2849.htm">2849</a>. In David, </p>
<blockquote>
The earth trembled and 
quaked, and the foundations of the mountains shook and trembled because He was angered. <a href="http://bible.gospelcom.net/cgi-bin/bible?passage=Ps%2018:6,%207&amp;version=ESV&amp;interface=print&amp;showfn=yes&amp;showxref">Ps 18:6, 7</a>. 
</blockquote>
<p>'The earth trembled and quaked' stands for the Church when its state has become perverted </p>
<p></p>
<p><b>[4]</b>
In John, </p>
<blockquote>
When he opened the sixth seal I looked again, and behold, a great earthquake took place, and the sun became black as sackcloth made of hair, and the full moon became like blood, and the stars 
in the sky fell to the earth. <a href="http://bible.gospelcom.net/cgi-bin/bible?passage=Rev%206:12,%2013&amp;version=ESV&amp;interface=print&amp;showfn=yes&amp;showxref">Rev 6:12, 13</a>. 
</blockquote>
<p>Here 'an earthquake', 'the sun', 'the moon', and 'the stars' have a similar meaning to that which they have above in Joel. In the same book, </p>
<blockquote>
At 
that hour a great earthquake took place, and a tenth part of the city fell, and there were killed in the earthquake seven thousand people.<A name="fntext1"></a><A href="#fn1"><sup>a</sup></a> <a href="http://bible.gospelcom.net/cgi-bin/bible?passage=Rev%2011:13&amp;version=ESV&amp;interface=print&amp;showfn=yes&amp;showxref">Rev 11:13</a>. 
</blockquote>
<p>From all these places it is evident that 'an 
earthquake' means nothing other than an alteration of the state of the Church, and that 'the earth' has no other meaning in the internal sense than the Church. And since 'the earth' is the Church it is 
clear that 'the new heaven and the new earth' which are to take the place of the previous heaven and earth, <a href="http://bible.gospelcom.net/cgi-bin/bible?passage=Isa%2065:17;%2066:22&amp;version=ESV&amp;interface=print&amp;showfn=yes&amp;showxref">Isa 65:17; 66:22</a>; <a href="http://bible.gospelcom.net/cgi-bin/bible?passage=Rev%2021:1&amp;version=ESV&amp;interface=print&amp;showfn=yes&amp;showxref">Rev 21:1</a>, means nothing other than a new Church, internal and external,

perverso facto statu Ecclesiae: [4] apud Johannem,           Porro vidi, cum aperuit sigillum sextum, cum ecce terrae      motus magnus factus est, et sol factus est niger sicut saccus      pilosus, 
et luna tota facta est sicut sanguis, et stellae      caeli ceciderunt in terram, Apoc. vi 12, 13; </p>
<p>ibi `terrae motus, sol, luna et stellae' simile significant ac supra apud Joelem: apud eundem,  
         In illa hora factus est terrae motus magnus, et decima      pars urbis cecidit, et occubuerunt in terrae motu nomina      hominum septem millia, Apoc. xi 13. Ex omnibus illis locis patet 
quod `terrae motus' non aliud sit quam mutatio status Ecclesiae, et quod `terra' non aliud in sensu interno sit quam Ecclesia; et quia `terra' est Ecclesia, constat quod per `novum caelum et novam terram' 
quae successum loco prioris, Esai. lxv 17, lxvi 22, Apoc. xxi 1, non aliud significetur quam nova Ecclesia interna et externa, n. 1733, 1850, 2117, 2118 f. @1 i Ecclesiae$  @2 i 2069$  @3 ejus I$  </p>
