<h3 align="center" class="ired">属天的奥秘 第7443节</h3>
<h4 align="center"></h4><p><strong>7443.</strong>“当那日，我必分别我百姓所立的歌珊地，使那里没有讨厌的苍蝇”表他们将不能利用恶毒的虚假去侵扰那些属于属灵教会的人，哪怕他们就在这些人附近。这从“分别”、“日”、“歌珊地”和“讨厌的苍蝇”的含义，以及以色列人的代表清楚可知：“分别”是指为防止交流而分离；“日”是指状态（参看<a href="23.htm">23</a>，<a href="487.htm">487</a>，<a href="488.htm">488</a>，<a href="493.htm">493</a>，<a href="893.htm">893</a>，<a href="2788.htm">2788</a>，<a href="3462.htm">3462</a>，<a href="3785.htm">3785</a>，<a href="4850.htm">4850</a>节），因此，“当那日分别”是指在这种状态下分离；“歌珊地”是指属世层的中间或至内在部分（<a href="5910.htm">5910</a>，<a href="6028.htm">6028</a>，<a href="6031.htm">6031</a>，<a href="6068.htm">6068</a>节），因以色列人住在歌珊地，故“歌珊地”也指教会（<a href="6649.htm">6649</a>节）；以色列人，即此处“耶和华的百姓”，是指那些属于属灵教会的人（参看<a href="7439.htm">7439</a>节）；“讨厌的苍蝇”是指恶毒的虚假（<a href="7441.htm">7441</a>节）。因此，“那里没有讨厌的苍蝇”表示他们将不能流入，因而不能利用这些虚假侵扰他人。他们之所以将不能利用这些虚假进行侵扰，是因为这些虚假是由存在于形成感官层的属世层最外在部分中的邪恶所产生的虚假，那些拥有良善与真理的人能被提升至该层之上，从而被提升至那里的虚假之上，正如刚才所述（<a href="7442.htm">7442</a>节）。当被提升至该层之上时，他们也就与那些沉浸于那里的虚假之人分离了。</p>

<p align="center"><b>Potts(1905-1910) 7443</b></p><p><b>7443.</b>
And I will sever in that day the land of Goshen, upon which My people stands, that no noisome fly be there. That this signifies that they shall not be able to infest by falsities of malevolence those 
who are in the spiritual church, although they are near them, is evident from the signification of "severing," as being to separate so that there is no communication; from the signification of "day," 
as being state (see n. 23, 487, 488, 493, 893, 2788, 3462, 3785, 4850), and therefore "to sever in that day" denotes to separate in that state; from the signification of "the land of Goshen," as being 
the midst or inmost in the natural (n. 5910, 6028, 6031, 6068), and as the sons of Israel were in Goshen, as being also the church (n. 6649); from the representation of the sons of Israel who are here 
the "people of Jehovah," as being those who are of the spiritual church (see above, n. 7439); and from the signification of the "noisome fly," as being the falsity of malevolence (n. 7441). Thus "no 
noisome fly being there," denotes that they could not flow in, consequently could not infest by means of these falsities. That they could not infest by means of these falsities, is because these falsities 
are falsities from the evils in the outermost parts of the natural mind, that is, in the sensuous, from which sensuous, thus from the falsities therein, they who are in good and truth can be elevated 
(according to what was said just above, n. 7442); and when they are being elevated, they are then also separated from those who are in falsities there. </p>

'And I will set apart on that day the land of Goshen, on which My people stand, so that the noxious flying insects are not there' means that they will not be able to use malevolent falsities to molest 
those who belong to the spiritual Church even though they are near them. This is clear from the meaning of 'setting apart' as separating to prevent communication; from the meaning of 'day' as state, 
dealt with in <a href="23.htm">23</a>, <a href="487.htm">487</a>, <a href="488.htm">488</a>, <a href="493.htm">493</a>, <a href="893.htm">893</a>, <a href="2788.htm">2788</a>, <a href="3462.htm">3462</a>, <a href="3785.htm">3785</a>, <a href="4850.htm">4850</a>, so that 'setting apart on that day' is separating during that state; from the meaning of 'the land of Goshen' as the middle or inmost part 
in the natural, dealt with in <a href="5910.htm">5910</a>, <a href="6028.htm">6028</a>, <a href="6031.htm">6031</a>, <a href="6068.htm">6068</a>, and also, since the children of Israel were in the land of Goshen, as the Church, <a href="6649.htm">6649</a>; from the representation of the children of Israel, to whom 
'Jehovah's people' refers here, as those who belong to the spiritual Church, dealt with above in <a href="7439.htm">7439</a>; and from the meaning of 'noxious flying insects' as malevolent falsity, dealt with above in <a href="7441.htm">7441</a>, 
so that 'the noxious flying insects are not there' means that they will not be able to flow in, and therefore not be able to use those falsities for molesting others. The reason why they would be 
unable to use those falsities to molest with is this: Those falsities are falsities arising from the evils present in the outermost parts of the natural mind which form the level of the senses, and those 
who have what is good and true within them can be raised above that level, and so above the falsities there, as accords with what has been stated immediately above in <a href="7442.htm">7442</a>. And when they are raised 
above it they are also separated from those who are steeped in the falsities there. </p>

`Et distinguam in die illo terram Goschen, super qua populus Meus stat, ut non esse ibi volatile noxium': quod significet quod non infestare poterunt per falsa malevolentiae [illos] qui ab Ecclesia 
spirituali, tametsi prope illos sunt, constat ex significatione `distinguere' quod sit separare ut non communicatio; ex significatione `diei' quod sit status, de qua n. 23, 487, 488, 493, 893, 2788, 3462, 
3785, 4850; inde `distinguere in die illo' est separare in illo statu; (m)ex significatione `terrae Goschen' quod sit medium seu intimum in naturali, de qua n. 5910, 6028, 6031, 6068, et quia filii 
Israelis erant in `Goschen' quod etiam sit Ecclesia, n. 6649;(n) ex repraesentatione `filiorum Israelis,' qui hic sunt `populus Jehovae,' quod sint qui ab Ecclesia spirituali, de qua supra n. 7439; 
et ex significatione `volatilis noxii' quod sit falsum malevolentiae, de qua supra n. 7441; ita `non esse ibi volatile noxium' est quod influere non poterunt, proinde non infestare per falsa illa.  Quod 
per illa falsa non infestare possent, est quia falsa illa sunt falsa ex malis in extremis mentis naturalis seu in sensuali, {1}a quo sensuali, ita a falsis ibi, illi qui in bono et vero sunt possunt 
{2} elevari, secundum illa quae mox supra n. 7442 dicta sunt; et cum {3}elevantur, tunc quoque ab illis qui in falsis ibi sunt separantur. 	@1 et$ 	@2 i ab illis$ 	@3 elevantur ab illis, ac tenentur 
in interioribus naturalis, tunc a sensuali et ab illis quae ibi, separati sunt, sunt enim tunc illa quae in sensuali sicut longe infra et non communicantia$ </p>
