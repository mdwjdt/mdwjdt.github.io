<h4 align="center"></h4><p><h4 align="center">（三）内义</h4><br /><strong>81.</strong>上一章论述人如何从死人成为属灵之人，本章则论述属天之人。时至今日，人对何为属天之人、何为属灵之人、何为死人几乎一无所知，故此，我被允许简述一下三者的性质和彼此之间的区别。<br />首先，死人除了认同肉体和世界，不认同两者之外的真理与良善；属灵之人认同属灵的和属天的真理与良善，不过，他的行为是以信为主导，非以爱为主导；属天之人相信且觉知属灵的和属天的真理与良善，只认同基于爱的信，且奉爱而行。<br />再者，死人只顾念肉体和世界，对永生和主的本质一无所知，即便有所知，也不愿相信。属灵之人顾念永生，因而也顾念主。属天之人顾念主，因而也顾念天堂和永生。<br />其三，死人遇见试探时几乎总是屈服，不遇试探时，则受着罪恶和愚痴的奴役。他所受的约束是外在的，诸如畏惧法律，害怕丧失性命、财富、利益、名声，等等；属灵之人也遇见试探，但常能得胜。他所受的约束是内在的，可称为“良知律”；属天之人不在试探中，当邪恶与虚假来袭时，他视若不见，堪称为“征服者”。他看似不受任何约束，随心自在。其实，他所受的约束，是对良善与真理的觉知。</p>

<p><strong>[NCE]81.</strong> Inner Meaning<br />THIS chapter deals with the heavenly person; the last dealt with the spiritual person, who previously had been lifeless. In modern times, though, people know nothing about the character of a heavenly person and very little about that of a spiritual person or of a lifeless one. Let me clarify the differences through a brief discussion of each type.<br />1. The only truth and goodness that lifeless people acknowledge are bodily and worldly kinds, and these they revere.<br />Spiritual people acknowledge spiritual and heavenly types of truth and goodness, but their acknowledgment stems from faith — as do their actions — and not as much from love.<br />Heavenly people believe and perceive truth and goodness of spiritual and heavenly kinds, but they acknowledge no other faith than one that springs from love; and love is also what moves them to action.<br />[2] 2. Those who are lifeless fixate purely on bodily and worldly life as their goals. They do not know what eternal life is or what the Lord is. If they have heard about these, they have no belief in them.<br />Those who are spiritual focus first on eternal life as their goal, and then on the Lord.<br />Those who are heavenly concentrate first on the Lord as their goal, and then on his kingdom and eternal life.<br />[3] 3. When the lifeless undergo conflict, they almost always give in. When they are free of conflict, evil and falsity master them, and they are slaves to it. Their restraints are external and include fear of the law and fear of losing their life, wealth, profits, and consequent reputation.<br />The spiritual are subject to conflict, but they always win. The restraints that curb them are internal ones termed the bonds of conscience.{*1} Heavenly people experience no conflict. If evil and falsity attack them, they spurn them, which is why they are called victors. They have no apparent restraints to curb them, being free, but they do have invisible restraints, which are the goodness and truth they perceive.<br /><br /><strong>Footnotes:</strong><br />{*1} The Latin word here translated "conscience" is conscientia, a word that encompasses the concepts of both conscience and consciousness (Chadwick and Rose 2008, under conscientia; see also <a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_81/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_608" target=_top>608</a>).

THE INTERNAL SENSE. This chapter treats of the celestial man, as the preceding one did of the spiritual, who was formed out of a dead man. But as it is unknown at this day what the celestial man is, 
and scarcely what the spiritual man is, or a dead man, it is permitted me briefly to state the nature of each, that the difference may be known. First, then, a dead man acknowledges nothing to be true 
and good but what belongs to the body and the world, and this he adores. A spiritual man acknowledges spiritual and celestial truth and good; but he does so from a principle of faith, which is likewise 
the ground of his actions, and not so much from love. A celestial man believes and perceives spiritual and celestial truth and good, acknowledging no other faith than that which is from love, from 
which also he acts.  [2] Secondly: The ends which influence a dead man regard only corporeal and worldly life, nor does he know what eternal life is, or what the Lord is; or should he know, he does 
not believe. The ends which influence a spiritual man regard eternal life, and thereby the Lord. The ends which influence a celestial man regard the Lord, and thereby His kingdom and eternal life.  [3] 
Thirdly: A dead man, when in combat almost always yields, and when not in combat, evils and falsities have dominion over him, and he is a slave. His bonds are external, such as the fear of the law, 
of the loss of life, of wealth, of gain, and of the reputation which he values for their sake. The spiritual man is in combat, but is always victorious; the bonds by which he is restrained are internal, 
and are called the bonds of conscience. The celestial man is not in combat, and when assaulted by evils and falsities, he despises them, and is therefore called a conqueror. He is apparently restrained 
by no bonds, but is free. His bonds, which are not apparent, are perceptions of good and truth. </p>

THE INTERNAL SENSE    The subject in this chapter is the celestial man; in the previous chapter it was the spiritual man who progressed to being spiritual from having been a dead man. But since people 
nowadays do not know what the celestial man is, and scarcely know what the spiritual man is or what the dead man is, let the nature of each one be presented briefly, in order that it may be known 
how they differ.  </p>
<p>First. The dead man acknowledges no other truth or good than that belonging to the body and the world. This he also worships. The spiritual man acknowledges spiritual and celestial 
truth and good. But he does so not so much from love as from faith, which is also the basis of his actions. The celestial man believes and perceives spiritual and celestial truth and good, and does 
not acknowledge any other faith than that which stems from love, which is also the basis of his actions.   Second. The dead man has solely the life of the body and of the world as his ends in view. 
He does not know what eternal life is, or what the Lord is. Or if he does know, he does not believe. The spiritual man has eternal life, and therefore the Lord, as his ends in view. The celestial man 
has the Lord and therefore His kingdom and eternal life as his ends in view.   Third. The dead man when involved in conflict nearly always gives in. And when there is no conflict evils and falsities 
reign supreme within him, making him their slave. His bonds are external ones, such as fear of the law, loss of life, wealth, profits, and reputation on account of these. The spiritual man is involved 
in conflict, but he always conquers. The bonds which restrain him are internal, and are called the bonds of conscience. The celestial man is not involved in conflict. If evils and falsities assail him, 
he treats them with contempt, and is therefore called a conqueror. No visible bonds restrict him, for he is a free man. His bonds, which are not visible, are perceptions of good and truth.

SENSUS INTERNUS </p>
<p>IN hoc capite agitur de caelesti homine, in praecedente actum est de spirituali, qui factus ex mortuo; sed quia hodie nescitur quid caelestis homo, vix quid spiritualis, nec quid 
mortuus, ut sciatur quae differentia, licet breviter tradere qualis unus et qualis alter. Primum: Mortuus homo non aliud verum et bonum agnoscit quam quod est corporis et mundi, hoc quoque adorat. Spiritualis 
homo agnoscit verum et bonum spirituale et caeleste, at ex fide, ex qua etiam agit, sed non ita ex amore. Caelestis homo verum et bonum spirituale et caeleste credit et percipit, nec agnoscit 
aliam fidem quam quae ex amore, ex quo etiam agit. Secundo: Fines mortui hominis spectant solum vitam corporis et mundi, nec novit quid vita aeterna et quid Dominus; sique scit, non credit. Fines spiritualis 
hominis spectant vitam aeternam et sic Dominum. Fines caelestis hominis spectant Dominum et sic regnum Ipsius et vitam aeternam. Tertio: Mortuus homo dum in pugna est, paene semper succumbit: 
cumque in nulla pugna, dominantur apud eum mala et falsa, et est servus. Vincula ejus sunt externa, ut timor legis, jacturae vitae, opum, lucri, famae propter ea. Spiritualis homo in pugna est; sed semper 
vincit. Vincula quibus agitur, sunt interna, et appellantur vincula conscientiae. Caelestis homo non in pugna est; sique mala et falsa impugnant, ea contemnit; quare etiam 'victor' appellatur. Nulla, 
quae apparent, vincula habet quibus agitur, sed est liber; illius vincula, quae non apparent, sunt perceptiones boni et veri. </p>
