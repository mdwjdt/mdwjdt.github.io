<h3 align="center" class="ired">属天的奥秘 第4440节</h3>
<h4 align="center"></h4><p><strong>4440.</strong>“那时他的儿子们正和群畜在田野”表他的后代，他们陷入自己的宗教表象。这从“他的儿子们”、“群畜”和“田野”的含义清楚可知：“他的儿子们”是指他的后代；“群畜”是指外在真理（参看<a href="1435.htm">1435</a>，<a href="4391.htm">4391</a>节）；“田野”是指教会（<a href="2971.htm">2971</a>，<a href="3766.htm">3766</a>节）。因此，“那时他的儿子们正和群畜在田野”表示他们处在自己的宗教表象中；事实上，诸如存在于雅各后代当中的这种教会必须被称为“宗教表象”（semblance of religion），因为它是没有内在的外在敬拜。</p>

And his sons were with his acquisition in the field. That this signifies his descendants-that they were in their own religiosity, is evident from the signification of his "sons," as being his descendants; 
from the signification of "acquisition," as being external truths (see n. 1435, 4391); and from the signification of a "field," as being the church (n. 2971, 3766). Hence by "his sons were with 
his acquisition in the field" is signified that they were in their own religiosity; for such a kind of church as existed among the descendants of Jacob should be called a "religiosity," because it was 
external worship without internal. </p>

<p align="center"><b>Elliott(1983-1999) 4440</b></p><p><b>4440.</b>
'And his sons were with his cattle in the field' means that his descendants dwelt in their own semblance of religion. This is clear from the meaning of 'his sons' as descendants; from the meaning of 
'castle' as external truths, dealt with in <a href="1435.htm">1435</a>,<A name="fntext1"></a><A href="#fn1"><sup>a</sup></a> <a href="4391.htm">4391</a>; and from the meaning of 'the field' as the Church, dealt with in <a href="2971.htm">2971</a>, <a href="3766.htm">3766</a>. Consequently 'his sons were with his cattle in the field' means that 
they dwelt in their own semblance of religion; for the kind of Church that existed with them must be called a semblance of religion since it involves external worship devoid of internal.

`Et filii ejus erant cum acquisitione ejus in agro': quod significet posteros quod in suo religioso essent, constat a significatione `filiorum ejus' quod sint posteri; ex significatione `acquisitionis' 
quod sint vera externa, de qua n. 1435, 4391; et ex significatione `agri' quod sit Ecclesia, de qua n. 2971, 3766; inde per quod `filii ejus essent cum acquisitione ejus in agro' significatur 
quod in suo religioso essent, nam religiosum dicendum est tale Ecclesiae, quale apud illos fuit {1}; erat enim cultus externus absque interno {2}.      @1 erat apud posteros Jacobi$      @2 i n.
