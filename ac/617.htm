<h4 align="center"></h4><p><strong>617.</strong>“挪亚生了三个儿子”表三种教义由此兴起，这一点从前文有关名字无非指教会，或说教义的内容明显可知。这里也是一样；但此处命名他们纯粹为了衔接上文。这衔接就是，主预见具有这种天赋的人能被赋予仁；然而，由此也诞生了三种教义，关于这三种教义，蒙主怜悯，等到探讨闪、含、雅弗时再予以描述。</p>

<p><strong>[NCE]617.</strong> The meaning of Noah fathered three sons as the fact that three kinds of theology would rise out of that church can be seen from all the earlier statements [<a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_617/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_337" target=_top>337</a>, <a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_617/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_339" target=_top>339</a>, <a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_617/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_402" target=_top>402</a>, <a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_617/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_468" target=_top>468</a>] that names stand purely as symbols for various churches or, to put it another way, various theologies. The same applies here. But the sole reason the names come up here is the context, or the connection with what preceded — that the Lord foresaw that people whose minds worked this way would be able to receive a gift for loving others, although they would still give birth to three different kinds of theology. These theologies will be discussed below where Shem, Ham, and Japheth are treated of, the Lord in his divine mercy willing.{*1} <br /><strong>Footnotes:</strong><br />{*1} On the approaches to religion symbolized by Shem, Ham, and Japheth, see, for example, <a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_617/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_975" target=_top>975</a>, <a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_617/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_1062" target=_top>1062</a>, <a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_617/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_1083" target=_top>1083</a>.

Noah begat three sons. That this signifies that three kinds of doctrine thence arose, is evident from all that has been shown before about names signifying nothing else than churches, or, what is the 
same, doctrines. So it is here; but here they are merely mentioned for the sake of the series or connection with the things that precede, which are, that it was foreseen by the Lord that the man of this 
genius could be endowed with charity; but yet that three kinds of doctrines would thence have birth, which doctrines, of the Lord's Divine mercy, shall be described hereafter, where Shem, Ham, and 
Japheth are treated of. </p>

That 'Noah beget three sons' means that three classes of doctrine arose out of this is clear from all that comes before it about names meaning nothing other than Churches, or what amounts to the same, 
systems of doctrine. The same applies here also. But here they are named purely for the sake of the sequence or connection with the details that precede. The connection is that the Lord foresaw that 
it would be possible for someone of this mental constitution to have charity conferred on him, but that nevertheless three classes of doctrine would be born of it. These doctrinal systems will in the 
Lord's Divine mercy be discussed later on where Shem, Ham, and Japheth are the subject. </p>

</p><b>617.</b>
Quod 'Noah genuerit tres filios' significet quod tria genera doctrinarum inde exsurgerent, constat ex omnibus illis quae praecedunt, quod nomina nihil aliud significent quam Ecclesias, seu quod idem 
est, doctrinas; ita quoque hic; sed hic modo nominantur ob seriem seu nexum cum iis quae praecedunt, qui est quod praevisum a Domino quod homo hujus genii potuisset donari charitate, sed usque quod inde 
doctrinarum tria genera nascerentur, de quibus doctrinis in sequentibus, ex Divina Domini Misericordia, dicetur, ubi de Shemo, Hamo, et Japheto. </p>
