<h3 align="center" class="ired">属天的奥秘 第6052节</h3>
<h4 align="center"></h4><p><strong>6052.</strong>“因为凡牧羊的，都是埃及人所厌恶的”表由此与反对教会的记忆知识的败坏记忆知识分离。这从“埃及所厌恶的”和“牧羊的”的含义清楚可知：“埃及所厌恶的”是指记忆知识的分离；因为凡所厌恶的事物都会被分离，它们之所以被厌恶，是因为它们违背并反对早已接受的观念和现在的爱（此处，它们反对“埃及人”所表示的败坏的记忆知识，因为经上说“凡牧羊的，都是埃及人所厌恶的”）；“牧羊的”是指引向良善的人，如前所述（<a href="6044.htm">6044</a>节）。支持良善的记忆知识就是那败坏的记忆知识所反对的。败坏的记忆知识是毁灭信之真理与仁之良善的知识，以及颠倒秩序的知识，如埃及的巫术。因为有许多符合秩序的东西被埃及的术士滥用了，如对应和代表，它们是在埃及人当中比在其他任何人民当中都要高度发达的记忆知识。甚至当恶人利用这些知识时，它们也是合乎秩序的；当他们利用这些知识来操控别人、伤害别人时，这些知识就因涉及巫术而被败坏了。至于此处所论述的记忆知识的分离，它是通过重新排列实现的；当伴随真理的良善来到“歌珊”所表示的中间或至内在部分时，反对它们的败坏记忆知识就被逐出。<br />到此为止，所论述的主题一直是真理与记忆知识的联结。关于这种联结，要进一步知道，内在人或属灵人与外在人或属世人的结合根本不可能实现，除非真理被引入记忆知识。因为记忆知识和属世情感的快乐构成外在人或属世人；因此，若不实现与记忆知识的联结，它根本无法实现。然而，为使人能够重生，他的内在人与外在人必须结合在一起。否则，从主经由内在人流入外在人或属世人的一切良善要么被败坏、窒息，要么被弃绝；在这种情况下，内在人也会被关闭。实现这种结合的方法就是本章所描述的，这种方法通过将真理引入记忆知识来实施。</p>

For every shepherd of the flock is an abomination of the Egyptians. That this signifies separation thus from perverted memory-knowledges, which are opposed to the memory-knowledges of the church, is 
evident from the signification of an "abomination of the Egyptians," as being the separation of memory-knowledges; for the things which are an abomination are separated, because the reason of their being 
abominated is that they are contrary to accepted principles and loves, thus because they are opposed; in the present case, opposed to the perverted memory-knowledges which are signified by the "Egyptians" 
when it is said that "every shepherd of the flock is an abomination to them;" and from the signification of a "shepherd of the flock," as being one who leads to good (of which above, n. 6044). 
The memory-knowledge which confirms good is that to which perverted memory-knowledge is opposed. Perverted memory-knowledges are those which destroy the truth of faith and the good of charity, and are 
also those which invert order, such as the magical things that existed in Egypt. For there are very many things that are in accordance with order which those magicians abused, such as correspondences 
and representatives, which were memory-knowledges more cultivated among them than among others. These follow from order even when the evil apply them, for in the application of them to the exercise 
of command over others, and to the doing of injury to others, they are perverted, because magical. In regard to their separation, which is here treated of, this is effected by means of the bringing into 
order that takes place when good with truths is in the midst or inmost, which is signified by "Goshen;" for then the perverted memory-knowledges which are opposed are cast out.      Up to this point 
the subject treated of has been the conjunction of truths with memory-knowledges, of which conjunction be it further known that the conjunction of the internal or spiritual man with the external or 
natural man cannot possibly be effected unless truths are insinuated into memory-knowledges. For memory-knowledges together with the delights of the natural affections constitute the external or natural 
man; and therefore unless conjunction is effected with memory-knowledges, it cannot be effected at all. And yet in order that a man may be regenerated, his internal and external must be conjoined 
together, for unless they are conjoined, all good flowing in from the Lord through the internal man into the external or natural man is either perverted, or suffocated, or rejected, and then the internal 
man is also closed. The method in which this conjunction is effected is what has been described in this chapter, which method is by means of the insertion of truths into memory-knowledges. </p>

'For every shepherd of the flock is an abomination to the Egyptians' means thereby a separation from perverted factual knowledge which is opposed to the Church's factual knowledge. This is clear from 
the meaning of 'an abomination to the Egyptians' as a separation of factual knowledge, for things that are an abomination are separated, and the reason why something is an abomination is that it is contrary 
and so opposed to ideas that have been adopted and to loves that are present (here it is opposed to perverted factual knowledge, meant by 'the Egyptians', since it says 'every shepherd of the 
flock is an abomination to them'); and from the meaning of 'a shepherd of the flock' as one who leads to good, dealt with in <a href="6044.htm">6044</a>. Factual knowledge that supports good is what perverted factual knowledge 
is opposed to. And perverted factual knowledge is what destroys the truth of faith and the good of charity, as well as being what turns order upside down, as magical practices in Egypt did. For there 
are many things in accord with order that were misused by the magicians of Egypt, such as correspondences and representatives, which existed as factual knowledge more highly developed among them than 
any other people. This knowledge conforms to order even when the evil make use of it; and when they make use of it to control other people and do harm to other people, that knowledge is perverted 
because it involves magic. As regards the separation of factual knowledge under consideration here, it is effected by a rearranging; when good accompanied by truths comes to be in the middle or inmost 
part meant by 'Goshen, perverted factual knowledge that is opposed to it is cast out. </p>
<p></p>
<p><b>[2]</b>
 Up to now the subject has been the joining of truths to factual knowledge. Regarding this joining together 
one should go on to recognize that a joining of the internal or spiritual man to the external or natural man cannot be effected at all unless truths are introduced into factual knowledge. For factual 
knowledge together with the delights that belong to natural affections constitutes the external or natural man, and therefore unless a joining to factual knowledge is effected, none at all is effected. 
But if a person is to become regenerated his internal and external must exist joined together. If they do not, then all good flowing in from the Lord by way of the internal man into the external or 
natural man is either perverted, smothered, or cast aside, in which case there is also a closing of the internal. The method by which that joining together is effected is what the present chapter has 
described, the execution of which method involves the introduction of truths into factual knowledge. </p>

`Quia abominatio Aegyptiorum omnis pastor gregis':  quod significet sic separationem a scientificis perversis quae opposita sunt scientificis Ecclesiae, constat a significatione `abominationis Aegyptiorum' 
quod sit separatio scientificorum; quae enim abominationi sunt, illa separata sunt, causa enim abominationis est quia contraria sunt principiis captis et amoribus, ita quia opposita, hic opposita 
scientificis {1}perversis, quae significantur per `Aegyptios', cum dicitur quod `abominatio illorum sit omnis pastor gregis'; et ex significatione `pastoris gregis' quod sit {2}qui ducit ad bonum, 
de qua supra n. 6044; scientificum quod {3}bonum' confirmat, est cui scientificum perversum est oppositum; scientifica perversa sunt quae destruunt verum fidei et bonum charitatis, et quoque sunt quae 
invertunt ordinem, sicut magica quae fuerunt in Aegypto; sunt enim secundum ordinem perplura quibus magi illi abusi sunt, prout sunt correspondentiae et repraesentativa, quae fuerunt scientifica apud 
illos plus quam apud alios exculta; haec sequuntur ex ordine etiam cum mali applicant, qui cum applicant illa ad imperandum aliis {3}et ad nocendum aliis, sunt perversa quia magica.  Quod separationem 
illorum de qua hic agitur, attinet, fit illa per ordinationem, {4}quando bonum cum veris est in medio seu intimo quod significatur per `Goshen', tunc scientifica perversa quae opposita, ejiciuntur. 
 [2]Hactenus de conjunctione verorum cum scientificis actum est, de qua conjunctione ulterius sciendum est quod conjunctio interni seu spiritualis hominis cum externo seu naturali nequaquam fieri queat 
nisi vera insinuentur scientificis; scientifica enim cum jucundis affectionum naturalium constituunt externum seu naturalem hominem, quapropter nisi conjunctio fiat {6}cum scientificis, nullatenus 
(t)fieri potest; et tamen ut {7}homo (x)regeneratus sit, internum ejus et externum conjuncta erunt, quae nisi conjuncta fuerint, omne bonum (t)influens a Domino per internum hominem in externum seu {8}naturalem, 
hoc vel pervertitur, vel suffocatur, vel {9}rejicitur; et tunc quoque internum clauditur; modus {10}quo conjunctio illa fit, est qui in hoc capite descriptus est, qui modus fit per insertionem 
verorum in scientifica. @1 Ecclesiae$ @2 quod$ @3 hoc$ @4 vel$ @5 cum$ @6 per scientifica$ @7 after sit$ @8 A alters to naturale hominis$ @9 reflectitur$ @10 quomodo$   (1)De Influxu,
