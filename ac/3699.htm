<h3 align="center" class="ired">属天的奥秘 第3699节</h3>
<h4 align="center"></h4><p><strong>3699.</strong>“见一个梯子立在地上”表最低级的真理及其衍生良善的联系。这从“梯子”和“地”的含义清楚可知：“梯子”是指联系，如下文所述；“地”是指最低级之物，因为紧接着经上说“梯子的头顶着天”，天是指最高点。所有这一切表明，地与天之间，或最低级之物与最高级之物之间所立的梯子表示联系。“立在地上的梯子”就表示最低级的真理及其衍生良善的联系，这一点从以下事实明显看出来：就内义而言，此处所论述的主题是雅各所代表的那个层级的真理及其衍生的良善。<br />在原文，“梯子”这个词来源于一个表示“路”或“大道”的词，“路”或“大道”用来论及真理（参看<a href="627.htm">627</a>，<a href="2333.htm">2333</a>节）。此外，当天使讨论真理时，他们的讨论以代表的形式在灵人界显现为“路”（参看<a href="189.htm">189</a>，<a href="3477.htm">3477</a>节）。由此明显可知，“梯子”是什么意思，它的一端立在地上，另一端直达天堂。也就是说，它表示在最低级之地的真理与在最高级之地的真理的联系，这种联系在下文有所论述。既有最低级的真理与良善，也有最高级的真理与良善，它们之间还有如同梯子那样的层级（参看<a href="3691.htm">3691</a>节）。</p>

And behold a ladder set on the earth. That this signifies the communication of the lowest truth and its derivative good, is evident from the signification of a "ladder," as being communication, concerning 
which we shall speak presently; and from the signification of the "earth," as being what is lowest, for it is said immediately afterwards that "its head reached unto heaven," which denotes that 
which is highest; all which shows that the "ladder set between earth and heaven," or between the lowest and the highest, signifies communication; that it is the communication of the lowest truth and its 
derivative good that is here signified by the "ladder set on the earth," is evident from the fact that the subject here is truth and its derivative good of that degree which in the internal sense is 
here represented by Jacob. In the original tongue the term "ladder" is derived from an expression which signifies a "path" or "way," and that "path" or "way" is predicated of truth, may be seen above 
(n. 627, 2333). Moreover, when angels are conversing about truth, this is exhibited representatively in the world of spirits by "ways" (n. 189, 3477); all of which shows what is signified by a "ladder, 
one extremity of which is set on the earth, while the other reaches to heaven," namely, the communication of truth which is in the lowest place with truth which is in the highest, which communication 
is treated of in what follows. (That there are lowest truths and goods, and also highest truths and goods, and steps between them as of a ladder, may be seen above, n. 3691.) </p>

<p align="center"><b>Elliott(1983-1999) 3699</b></p><p><b>3699.</b>
'And behold, a stairway set up on the earth' means a communication of lowest truth and of good derived from this truth. This is clear from the meaning of 'a stairway' as communication, dealt with below, 
and from the meaning of 'the earth' as what is lowest, for immediately after this it is stated that its top reached to heaven, which is the highest point. From this it is evident that a stairway between 
earth and heaven, or what is lowest and what is highest, is communication. For it is the communication of lowest truth and of good derived from this truth that is meant by 'a stairway set up on 
the earth', as is evident from the fact that that degree of truth and of good derived from it, which 'Jacob' represents here, is the subject at this point in the internal sense. </p>
<p></p>
<p><b>[2]</b>
 In the original 
language the word for a stairway is derived from a word meaning a pathway or highway, which is used in reference to truth, see <a href="627.htm">627</a>, <a href="2333.htm">2333</a>. Furthermore when angels are discussing truth their discussion 
manifests itself representatively in the world of spirits as pathways, see <a href="189.htm">189</a>, <a href="3477.htm">3477</a>. From this it is evident what 'a stairway' means, one end of which is set up on the earth while the other reaches 
up to heaven. That is to say, it means a communication of truth in the lowest place with truth in the highest place, a communication dealt with below. For there are lowest truths and goods and highest 
truths and goods, and degrees of them in between like a stairway, see <a href="3691.htm">3691</a>. </p>

`Et ecce scala statuta terrae': quod significet communicationem infimi veri et boni inde, constat ex significatione `scalae' quod sit communicatio, de qua sequitur; et ex significatione `terrae' quod 
sit infimum, nam mox dicitur quod `caput ejus pertingeret caelum,' quod est supremum; inde patet quod scala quae inter terram et caelum, seu inter infimum et supremum, sit communicatio; quod communicatio 
infimi veri et inde boni sit quae per `scalam statutam terrae' significatur, patet ex eo quod de illius gradus vero et inde bono quod per Jacobum hic repraesentatur, in sensu interno hic agatur. 
[2] In lingua originali vox scalae {1}derivatur a voce quae significat semitam seu {2}viam, quae quod praedicetur de vero, videatur n. 627, 2333; etiam cum apud angelos de vero est sermo, sistitur id 
repraesentative in mundo spirituum per vias, videatur n. 189, 3477; inde patet quid `scala' significat, cujus una extremitas est statuta terrae, et altera pertingit caelum, quod nempe communicatio veri 
quod infimo loco est, cum vero quod {3}supremo, de qua communicatione sequitur; quod sint vera et bona infima, et vera et bona suprema, et inter illa gradus sicut scalae, videatur n. 3691. @1 est 
ex derivatione vocis$ @2 Heb [    ] (sullam) = ladder; [    ] (mesillah) = highway, but in n. 627, 2333 `way' is expressed in the Heb by [   ] (derek)$ @3 i in$ </p>
