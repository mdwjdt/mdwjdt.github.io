<h4 align="center"></h4><p><strong>4930.</strong>“就给他起名叫谢拉”表它的性质。这从“起名”的含义清楚可知，“起名”是指性质（参看<a href="4927.htm">4927</a>节）。“谢拉”所表示的性质就是真相的性质，而真相则是至此在内义上一直所论述的主题；这个真相就是，实际上良善才是头生的，真理只是表面上看是头生的。这个性质本身包含无数细节，这些无数细节无法在尘世之光，只能在天堂之光中被看到，因而能被天使的眼睛看到。人若看见诸如显现在天使面前的一个事物的性质，必目瞪口呆，承认他永远不会相信，还会承认，与天使相比，他几乎什么也不知道。在原文，“谢拉”表示“升起”，用来论及太阳及其光的第一个表象。这解释了为何这个儿子被起名叫谢拉，因为对正经历重生的人来说，良善也是一样。良善首先升起，放出光芒，属世人里面的事物因这光而被光照，好叫它们能被看到，承认，最后相信。若非光从存在于人里面的良善流出，他永远不可能看见真理，乃至承认并相信它们，而是将它们要么视为那种为了平民百姓的缘故而不得不被称为真理的事物，要么视为虚假。</p>

<p align="center"><b>Potts(1905-1910) 4930</b></p><p><b>4930.</b>
And he called his name Zerah. That this signifies the quality, is evident from the signification of "calling a name," as being the quality (see n. 4927). The quality which is signified by "Zerah," is 
the quality of what has been hitherto the subject treated of in the internal sense, namely, that good is actually the firstborn and truth only apparently so. The quality itself contains innumerable things 
within it which cannot be seen in the light of the world, but only in the light of heaven, thus before the angels. If man should see the quality of a single thing as it appears before the angels, 
he would be amazed, and would confess that he would never have believed it, and that in comparison he had known scarcely anything. "Zerah," in the original language, signifies a "rising," and is applied 
to the sun and to the first appearance of its light. He was named Zerah from this because it is similar with good in the man who is being regenerated, for this first rises and gives light, from which 
light are enlightened the things in the natural man, so that they may be seen, and acknowledged, and finally believed. Unless there were light from good inwardly in man, he would never be able to 
see truths so as to acknowledge and believe them, but would look upon them either as things to be called true on account of the common people, or else as falsities. </p>

'And he called his name Zerah' means the essential nature of it. This is clear from the meaning of 'calling the name' as the essential nature, as above in <a href="4927.htm">4927</a>. The essential nature meant by 'Zerah' 
is the nature of the reality which has been the subject in the internal sense up to this point, this reality being that in actual fact good is the firstborn but that truth appears to be such. That nature 
contains countless details, countless details such as cannot be seen in the light of the world, only in the light of heaven, and so by the eyes of the angels. If man could see the essential nature 
of a single reality like those visible to the angels he would be dumbfounded and would confess he would never have believed it, adding that compared with the angels he knew scarcely anything. In the 
original language Zerah means 'the rise' and is used to refer to the sun and the first sign of its light. This explains why this son was named Zerah, for good behaves in a similar way in the case of one 
who is being regenerated. Good first rises and sheds light, and from this light things within the natural man are lightened, enabling them to be seen, acknowledged, and finally believed. If light did 
not flow from the good present within that person he would never be able to see truths so that he could acknowledge and believe them. Instead he would see them as no more than the kind of things that 
have to be called truths for the common people's sake, or else as falsities </p>

</p><b>4930.</b>
`Et vocavit nomen ejus Zerah': quod significet quale, constat a significatione `vocare nomen' quod sit quale, ut supra n. 4927; quale quod significatur per `Zerah', est quale illius rei de qua in 
sensu interno hactenus actum est, nempe quod bonum (t) actualiter primogenitum sit et verum apparenter; ipsum quale in se innumerabilia continet, quae innumerabilia non videri possunt in luce mundi, 
sed in luce caeli, ita coram angelis; si homo unius rei quale videret sicut apparet coram angelis, obstupesceret et confiteretur quod nusquam id credidisset, et quod respective is paene nihil sciret. 
 Zerah in lingua originali significat `ortum', et tribuitur soli et primae apparitioni ejus lucis; inde nominatus est Zerah quia bonum similiter se habet apud hominem qui regeneratur; id enim 
primum oritur et dat lucem, ex qua luce illustrantur illa quae {1} in naturali homine, ut videri, et agnosci, et denique {2} credi possint; nisi lux foret ex bono intus in homine, nusquam {3} ad agnitionem 
et fidem videre posset vera, sed modo vel sicut talia quae dicenda propter vulgus, vel sicut falsa. @1 i sunt$ @2 i ut$ @3 i usque$ </p>
