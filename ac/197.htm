<h3 align="center" class="ired">属天的奥秘 第197节</h3>
<h4 align="center"></h4><p><strong>197.</strong>对于属天的上古之人，“蛇”代表警醒，也代表保持警醒、免得遭受伤害的感官意识。这一象征从主对门徒的话可知，他说：“看哪，我差你们去，如同羊进入狼群。所以，你们要灵巧像蛇，驯良像鸽子。”（马太福音<a href="http://39-27.cn/太10.16.htm">10:16</a>）<br />类似地，也从旷野被举起的“铜蛇”可知。“铜蛇”象征主的感官意识，唯有他是属天之人，也唯有他看顾并供养万有。正因如此，凡仰望铜蛇的都得到了拯救。</p>

<p><strong>[NCE]197.</strong> When the earliest people (whose nature was heavenly) spoke of a snake, they meant watchfulness. They also meant the sensory level of the mind, which enabled them to watch out for any evil that might otherwise hurt them. This is illustrated by the Lord's words to the disciples:<br />Here, I'm sending you out as sheep in the midst of wolves. So be shrewd as snakes and simple as doves. (<a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_197/bible_king-james-version_matthew_10_16" target=_top>Matthew 10:16</a>)<br />Something similar was meant by the bronze snake lifted up in the wilderness [<a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_197/bible_king-james-version_numbers_21_9" target=_top>Numbers 21:9</a>]. It symbolized the sensory level in the Lord — the only heavenly person and the only being who watches over and provides for everything. That is why the people who looked on the bronze snake were saved. </p>
<p align="center"><b>Potts(1905-1910) 197</b></p><p><b>197.</b>
Among the most ancient people, who were celestial men, by the "serpent" was signified circumspection, and also the sensuous part through which they exercised circumspection so as to be secure from injury. 
This signification of a "serpent" is evident from the Lord's words to His disciples: </p>
<p>     Behold, I send you forth as sheep into the midst of wolves; be ye therefore prudent as serpents, and simple 
as doves (Matt. 10:16). And also from the "brazen serpent" that was set up in the wilderness, by which was signified the sensuous part in the Lord, who alone is the celestial man, and alone takes 
care of and provides for all; wherefore all who looked upon it were preserved. </p>

<p align="center"><b>Elliott(1983-1999) 197</b></p><p><b>197.</b>
With the most ancient people, who were celestial, a serpent meant being completely watchful, and so also meant their sensory perception by means of which they were to show vigilance to avoid being harmed 
by the evil. This is clear from the Lord's words to His disciples, </p>
<blockquote>
Behold, I send you out as sheep in the midst of wolves; so be shrewd as serpents and simple as doves. <a href="http://bible.gospelcom.net/cgi-bin/bible?passage=Matt%2010:16&amp;version=ESV&amp;interface=print&amp;showfn=yes&amp;showxref">Matt 10:16</a>.   
</blockquote>
And also 
'the bronze serpent' which was raised up in the wilderness and which meant the Lord's Sensory Perception. He alone is Celestial Man, and He alone is completely watchful and provides for everybody. 
Whoever beheld it therefore was delivered.  </p>

<p align="center"><b>Latin(1748-1756) 197</b>
</p><b>197.</b>
Per 'serpentem' apud antiquissimos qui fuerant caelestes homines, significabatur circumspectio; ita similiter sensuale per quod se circumspicerent ne a malis nocerentur; quod constat ex Domini verbis 
ad discipulos, 	Ecce Ego mitto vos sicut oves in medium luporum; estote ergo prudentes sicut serpentes, et simplices sicut columbae, Matth. x 16;. tum etiam per 'serpentem aeneum' qui erectus in deserto, 
per quem significatum Sensuale Domini, Qui solus Caelestis Homo, et solus circumspicit et providet omnibus; quare qui intuiti sunt Ipsum, servati sunt. </p>
