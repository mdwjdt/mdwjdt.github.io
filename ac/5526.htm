<h3 align="center" class="ired">属天的奥秘 第5526节</h3>
<h4 align="center"></h4><p><strong>5526.</strong>“这样，我就把你们的弟兄交给你们”表这样真理就会变成良善。这从西缅和雅各的十个儿子的代表清楚可知：西缅，即此处“交给他们的的弟兄”是指意愿中的信（参看<a href="5482.htm">5482</a>节）；雅各的十个儿子，即此处约瑟把西缅所“交给”的人，是指属世层中教会的真理（<a href="5403.htm">5403</a>，<a href="5419.htm">5419</a>，<a href="5427.htm">5427</a>，<a href="5428.htm">5428</a>，<a href="5512.htm">5512</a>节）。“这样，我就把你们的弟兄交给你们”之所以表示这样真理就会变成良善，是因为当“交给”意愿中的信时，真理就变成了良善。<br />事实上，一旦属于教义的信之真理进入意愿，它就变成了生活的真理和行为上的真理，这时就被称为良善，也变成属灵的良善；主会在人里面利用这良善来形成一个新意愿。意愿之所以使得真理成为良善，是因为就本身而言，意愿无非是爱；凡人所爱的，他都会意愿；凡他不爱的，他都不会意愿；还因为凡出于爱，或从爱流出的，都被人感觉为良善，因为他以此为快乐。由此可知，凡出于意愿或从意愿流出的，都是良善。</p>

<p align="center"><b>Potts(1905-1910) 5526</b></p><p><b>5526.</b>
I will give you your brother. That this signifies that thus truths would become goods, is evident from the representation of Simeon, who here is the "brother whom he would give them," as being faith 
in the will (see n. 5482); and from the representation of the ten sons of Jacob, who here are they to whom he would be "given," as being the truths of the church in the natural (n. 5403, 5419, 5427, 5428, 
5512). That by "I will give you your brother" is signified that thus truths will become goods, is because when there exists faith in the will, truths become goods; for as soon as the truth of faith 
which is of doctrine enters the will, it becomes the truth of life, and becomes truth in act, and is then called good, and also becomes spiritual good. From this good a new will is formed in man by 
the Lord. That the will causes truth to be good, is because regarded in itself the will is nothing else than the love, for whatever a man loves he wills, and whatever he does not love he does not will; 
and also because all that which is of the love or from the love is perceived by the man as good, for it delights him. Hence it is that everything that is of the will or from the will is good. </p>

<p align="center"><b>Elliott(1983-1999) 5526</b></p><p><b>5526.</b>
'I will give you your brother' means that truths will thereby be made forms of good. This becomes clear from the representation of Simeon, who is 'the brother' here whom he would give them, as faith 
in the will, dealt with in <a href="5482.htm">5482</a>; and from the representation of the ten sons of Jacob, who are the ones here to whom he would be given, as the truths known to the Church present within the natural, dealt 
with in <a href="5403.htm">5403</a>, <a href="5419.htm">5419</a>, <a href="5427.htm">5427</a>, <a href="5428.htm">5428</a>, <a href="5512.htm">5512</a>. The reason 'I will give you your brother' means that truths will thereby be made forms of good is that when faith in the will is 'given', truths are made forms 
of good. </p>
<p></p>
<p><b>[2]</b>
 For as soon as the truth of faith, which is a matter of doctrine, enters the will it is made the truth of life and truth put into practice, in which case it is called good and also becomes 
spiritual good; and the Lord uses this good to form a new will in the person. The will causes truth to exist as a form of good for the reason that essentially the will is nothing else than love 
(for whatever a person loves he wills, and whatever he does not love he does not will), and also for the reason that everything which is a product of love or flows from love is perceived by a person 
as a form of good since he takes delight in it. From this it follows that everything which is a product of the will or flows from the will is a form of good. </p>

</p><b>5526.</b>
`Fratrem vestrum dabo vobis': quod significet quod ita vera fient bona, constare potest ex repraesentatione `Shimeonis' qui hic est `frater quem illis daret', quod sit fides voluntate, de qua n. 5482; 
et ex repraesentatione `decem filiorum Jacobi', qui hic sunt `illi quibus daretur {1}' quod sint vera Ecclesiae in naturali, de qua n. 5403, 5419, 5427, 5428, 5512; quod per `fratrem vestrum dabo vobis' 
significetur quod ita vera fient bona, est quia cum datur fides voluntate, vera fiunt bona; [2] verum enim fidei quod est doctrinae, ut primum intrat voluntatem, fit verum vitae et fit actu verum, 
et tunc vocatur bonum et fit quoque bonum spirituale; ex hoc bono formatur a Domino apud hominem nova voluntas; quod voluntas faciat verum ut sit bonum, est causa quia voluntas in se spectata non aliud 
est quam amor; quicquid enim homo amat, hoc vult, et quicquid non amat, non vult; et quia omne quod est amoris seu ex amore, hoc percipitur ab homine ut bonum, jucundat enim illum; inde est quod 
omne quod est voluntatis seu ex voluntate, sit bonum. @1 i frater$ </p>
