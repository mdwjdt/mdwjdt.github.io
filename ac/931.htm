<h3 align="center" class="ired">属天的奥秘 第931节</h3>
<h4 align="center"></h4><p><strong>931.</strong>“尽地所有的日子”表整个时间。这一点从“日子”的含义清楚可知，“日子”表一段时间（参看<a href="23.htm">23</a>，<a href="487.htm">487</a>-<a href="488.htm">488</a>，<a href="493.htm">493</a>节）。所以，“地的日子”在此表大地（或地球）存留或可居住的整个时间。教会一不存在，大地（或地球）就无法再居住。因为教会若不再存在，人与天堂的交流也不再存在，一旦这种交流停止，一切居民都会灭亡。如前所述，教会就象人的心与肺，只要心、肺正常，人就能存活；同样，只要教会存活，大人，也就是整个天堂也就存活。故而此处经上说“尽地所有的日子，播种与收割、冷与热、夏与冬、昼与夜，就永不停息了”。由此清楚表明，大地（或地球）不会永远持续存在，而是也有终结的时候，因为经上说，“尽地所有的日子”，即只要大地（或地球）继续存在。<br />然而，人若以为大地（或地球）和圣言所预言的最后审判（那里描述了时代的末了，讨罚的日子和最后的审判）是一回事，就大错特错了。因为当教会荒废，即不再有信时，最后的审判就会临到它。当上古教会灭亡，如洪水前的最后一代人的情形时，最后的审判就临到了它。对犹太教会的最后审判则发生在主降世之时。当主在荣耀中降临时，还会有进一步的最后审判。这并不是说到那时，大地和这个世界要被毁灭，而是说教会要灭亡，然后通常会有一个新教会被主兴起。如，大洪水发生之时，古教会被兴起，主降世之时，外邦人中的原始教会被兴起。同样，主在荣耀中降临时，一个新教会必被兴起，这也是新天新地所表之义。<br />人若重生，变成教会成员，即教会，其情形也是如此。他被新造后，其内在人就被称为“一个新天”，其外在人则被称为“一个新地”。此外，人死之后还会面临一次最后的审判，到那时，照他在肉身时的所作所为，他的判决要么是死亡，要么是生命。时代的末了，末日，或最后的审判没有别的意思，这一点从主在路加福音中的话清楚看出来：<br />当那一夜，两个人在一个床上，要取去一个，留下一个。两个女人一同推磨，要取去一个，留下一个。两个人在田里，要取去一个，留下一个。（路加福音<a href="http://39-27.cn/路17.34.htm">17:34</a>-<a href="http://39-27.cn/路17.36.htm">36</a>）<br />此处，末世被称为“夜”，因为不再有信，即仁存在。然而，有的要被留下，这清楚表明，到那时，这个世界不会被摧毁。</p>

<p><strong>[NCE]931.</strong> The symbolism of throughout all the days of the earth to come as all time, is established by the symbolism of a day as the times; see <a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_931/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_23" target=_top>23</a>, <a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_931/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_487" target=_top>487</a>, <a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_931/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_488" target=_top>488</a>, <a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_931/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_493" target=_top>493</a>. So a day of the earth here is all time, as long as the earth lasts — that is to say, as long as an inhabitant remains on the planet. Inhabitants first come to an end when the church ceases to exist, because when the church is gone, humankind loses contact with heaven, and when that contact ends, every earth-dweller dies out.<br />The church is like a person's heart and lungs, as already mentioned.{*1} As long we have a heart that is sound, and lungs, too, we are alive. The same is true of the church in relation to the universal human, which is the whole of heaven.{*2} That is why the present verse says, "Throughout all the days of the earth, sowing and reaping and cold and heat and summer and winter and day and night will not end."<br />This also indicates that the planet will not last forever but will have its end as well, since it says, "throughout all the days of the earth," that is, as long as the earth exists.<br />[2] People believe, though, that the end of the earth is the same as the Last Judgment mentioned in the Word, where the culmination of the age, the day of divine visitation, and the Last Judgment are dealt with.{*3} They are wrong. A last judgment comes to every church when it goes through the process of devastation, which is the stage at which there is no longer any faith in it.<br />The earliest church had its last judgment when it perished, as it did among its final descendants, just before the Flood. The Jewish church had its last judgment when the Lord came into the world. A last judgment has yet to come, too, when the Lord comes into his glory. Not that the earth and the world will then be destroyed but that the church will.{*4} Afterward, however, the Lord always brings a new church back to life. So at the time of the Flood, he raised up the ancient church, and at the time of his Coming, he raised up the early [Christian] church among non-Jews. It will be the same when the Lord comes into his glory.<br />This is also what "the new heaven and the new earth" means [<a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_931/bible_king-james-version_isaiah_65_17" target=_top>Isaiah 65:17</a>; <a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_931/bible_king-james-version_isaiah_66_22" target=_top>66:22</a>; <a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_931/bible_king-james-version_revelation_21_1" target=_top>Revelation 21:1</a>].<br />[3] The case resembles that of every regenerate person, who becomes a part of the church — becomes a church, in fact — after being created anew. The inner self of such people is called a new heaven and their outer self a new earth.<br />In addition, every individual also has a last judgment at death, because at that time, depending on how we behaved in the body, we receive a verdict of either death or life.{*5} An indication that the end of the age, the cataclysm, and the Last Judgment have no other meaning and therefore do not imply the world's obliteration is clear from the Lord's words in Luke:<br />On that night there will be two in one bed; one will be taken, the other left. Two will be grinding together; one will be taken and the other left. Two will be in the field; one will be taken and the other left. (<a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_931/bible_king-james-version_luke_17_34" target=_top>Luke 17:34</a>, <a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_931/bible_king-james-version_luke_17_35" target=_top>35</a>, <a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_931/bible_king-james-version_luke_17_36" target=_top>36</a>)<br />The last stage is called the night here because there will be no faith, that is, no charity. It says that some people will be left, which clearly indicates that the world will not be annihilated at that time.<br /><br /><strong>Footnotes:</strong><br />{*1} Strictly speaking, Swedenborg has not yet mentioned the lungs in these comparisons, which occur in <a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_931/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_468#subsection-2-2" target=_top>468:2</a> and 637:1. His own index of Secrets of Heaven gives the present passage as the first relevant location in the work. However, he goes on to include the lungs with the heart in <a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_931/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_2054" target=_top>2054</a>, <a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_931/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_2853#subsection-2-3" target=_top>2853:3</a>, <a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_931/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_2913#subsection-2-3" target=_top>2913:3</a>, <a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_931/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_4217#subsection-2-3" target=_top>4217:3</a>, <a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_931/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_4423" target=_top>4423:1</a>.

[JSR]<br />{*4} This comment foreshadows a crucial aspect of Swedenborg's later thought: the idea that the Last Judgment of the dispensation of the Christian Church took place in the spiritual world in 1757. He went on to describe this event in his 1758 work Last Judgment, but here he speaks of it in apparent unawareness of the central place the event would someday have in his own theology. (This passage, published in 1749, contains one of his first allusions to this judgment. Another early reference, written on February 13, 1748, appears in his journal Spiritual Experiences [Swedenborg 1998-2002] <a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_931/swedenborg_spiritual-experiences-odhner_765" target=_top>765</a>; there he relates a vision of the number 57, guessing at its connection with the year 1657.) According to Swedenborg, the Last Judgment essentially consists of a purgation of the world of spirits, which, since the time of Christ, had accepted those who were externally but not internally good. These people had managed to construct a kind of counterfeit heaven in their realm, which began to obstruct the communion of heaven and earth. Their expulsion from the world of spirits does not result in an apocalypse of the conventional sort, but enables heaven to communicate with earth in a more direct manner than was previously possible. This in turn lays the groundwork for the creation of a new church.

During all the days of the earth. That this signifies all time, is evident from the signification of "day" as being a time (see n. 23, 487, 488, 493); wherefore "the days of the earth" here mean all 
time so long as there is earth [terra], or inhabitant upon the earth [tellure]. An inhabitant first ceases to be on the earth when there is no longer any church. For when there is no church, there is 
no longer any communication of man with heaven, and when this communication ceases, every inhabitant perishes. As we have seen before, it is with the church as with the heart and lungs in man: so long 
as the heart and lungs are sound, so long the man lives; and such also is the case with the Grand Man, which is the universal heaven, so long as the church lives; and therefore it is here said "during 
all the days of the earth, seed-time and harvest, and cold and heat, and summer and winter, and day and night shall not cease." From this it also may appear that the earth will not endure to eternity, 
but that it too will have its end; for it is said, "during all the days of the earth" that is, as long as the earth endures.  [2] But as to believing that the end of the earth will be the same thing 
as the last judgment, foretold in the Word-where the consummation of the age, the day of visitation, and the last judgment are described-this is a mistake; for there is a last judgment of every church 
when it has been vastated, or when there is no longer in it any faith. The last judgment of the Most Ancient Church was when it perished, as in its last posterity just before the flood. The last judgment 
of the Jewish Church was when the Lord came into the world. There will also be a last judgment when the Lord shall come in glory; not that the earth and the world are then to perish, but that 
the church perishes; and then a new church is always raised up by the Lord; as at the time of the flood was the Ancient Church, and at the time of the coming of the Lord the primitive church of the Gentiles. 
 [3] So also will there be a new church when the Lord shall come in glory, which is also meant by the new heaven and new earth, in like manner as with every regenerate man, who becomes a man 
of the church, or a church, and whose internal man, when he has been created anew, is called a new heaven, and his external man a new earth. Moreover there is also a last judgment for every man when he 
dies, for then, according to what he has done in the body, he is adjudged either to death or to life. That nothing else is meant, consequently not the destruction of the world, by the consummation of 
the age, the end of days, or the last judgment, is clearly evident from the words of the Lord in Luke: </p>
<p>     In that night there shall be two men in one bed; the one shall be taken and the other shall 
be left; there shall be two women grinding together, the one shall be taken, and the other shall be left (Luke 17:34-36), where the last time is called "night" because there is no faith, that is, 
no charity; and where by some being "left" it is clearly indicated that the world will not then perish. </p>

<p align="center"><b>Elliott(1983-1999) 931</b></p><p><b>931.</b>
That 'during all the days of the earth' means the whole of time is clear from the meaning of 'day' as a period of time, see <a href="23.htm">23</a>, <a href="487.htm">487</a>, <a href="488.htm">488</a>, <a href="493.htm">493</a>. Here therefore 'days of the earth' is the whole time the 
earth remains, or is inhabited. The earth ceases to be inhabited the moment the Church is no more. For when the Church is no more, no communication of man with heaven exists any longer, and when this 
communication comes to an end every inhabitant perishes. As stated already, the Church is like the heart and lungs in the individual. As long as the heart is sound, and also the lungs, the individual 
is alive; and the same applies to the Church and its relationship to the Grand Man, which is heaven in its entirety. This is the reason for the statement here 'during all the days of the earth, seedtime 
and harvest, and cold and heat, and summer and winter, and day and night will not cease'. From this it also becomes clear that the earth is not going to last for ever, but that it too will come to 
an end, for the reference is 'all the days of the earth', that is, as long as the earth remains. </p>
<p></p>
<p><b>[2]</b>
 People are however mistaken in their belief that the end of the earth will be one and the same 
event as the Last Judgement referred to in the Word, that is to say, where the close of the age, the day of visitation, and the Last Judgement, are described. For a last judgement befalls every Church 
when it has been vastated, that is, when no faith exists there any longer. A last judgement on the Most Ancient Church took Place when it perished, as it did among its final descendants who lived immediately 
prior to the Flood. A last judgement on the Jewish Church took place when the Lord came into the world. And a further last judgement will take place when the Lord comes in glory. This does not 
mean that at that time the earth and the world are going to be destroyed, but that the Church is destroyed and, as always happens, a new Church is raised up by the Lord at that time. At the time of 
the Flood the Ancient Church was raised up, at the time of the Lord's Coming the primitive Church among gentiles; and the same will happen when the Lord comes in glory. It is also what 'a new heaven and 
a new earth' are used to mean.  </p>
<p></p>
<p><b>[3]</b>
 It is similar with everyone who has been regenerated and becomes a member of the Church, that is, becomes the Church. When he has been created anew his internal 
man is called 'a new heaven' and his external 'a new earth'. In addition a last judgement awaits everybody when he dies, for at that point, according to how he has acted during his lifetime, his judgement 
points either to death or to life. The fact that the close of the age, the end of days, or the Last Judgement have no other meaning, and do not therefore mean the destruction of the world, is 
quite clear from the Lord's words in Luke,  </p>
<blockquote>
In that night there will be two in one bed, one will be taken and the other left. Two women will be grinding together, one will be taken and the other left. 
Two will be in the field, one will be taken and the other left. <a href="http://bible.gospelcom.net/cgi-bin/bible?passage=Luke%2017:34-36&amp;version=ESV&amp;interface=print&amp;showfn=yes&amp;showxref">Luke 17:34-36</a>. 
</blockquote>
<p>Here the last times are called 'night' because no faith, that is, no charity exists. The fact that some will be 'left' 
however is a clear indication that the world is not going to be destroyed at that time. </p>

Quod 'adhuc omnibus diebus terrae' significent omne tempus, constat ex significatione 'diei,' quod sit tempus, videatur n. 23, 487, 488, 493; quare hic 'dies terrae' est omne tempus quamdiu terra seu

omnis incola perit; Ecclesia se habet, ut prius dictum, sicut cor et pulmo in homine; quamdiu cor integrum est et pulmo, tamdiu vivit homo, ita quoque quamdiu Ecclesia respective ad Maximum Hominem, qui 
est universum caelum; quare hic dicitur 'omnibus diebus terrae sementis et messis, et frigus et aestus, et aestas et hiems, et dies et nox, non cessabunt'; inde constare quoque potest quod tellus in
