<h3 align="center" class="ired">属天的奥秘 第3833节</h3>
<h4 align="center"></h4><p><strong>3833.</strong>“到了晚上”表这种状态仍旧模糊的时候。这从“晚上”的含义清楚可知，“晚上”是指一种模糊的状态（参看<a href="3056.htm">3056</a>节）。此外，在拥有适当宗教仪式的古人当中，晚上举办筵席，也就是晚餐，无非表示先于结合的引入状态。相对于结合的状态，这种状态是模糊的。事实上，当人正被引入真理，并由此被引入良善时，他学到的一切都是模糊的。但是，一旦良善与他结合，并且他站在良善的立场上看待真理，那么他所学到的一切就会向清楚显明，并且越来越清晰。因为他现在不再怀疑某事是否存在，或它是不是真的，而是知道它的确存在并且千真万确。<br />一旦人到达这种状态，他便开始知道数不清的事物，因为他现在从他所相信并觉知到的良善与真理出发，如同从一个中心点出发到周围区域；他在何种程度上从这良善与真理出发，就在何种程度上看见周围的事物，且所看的范围越来越广，因为他不断推出并拓宽边界。此后，他又从位于这些边界空间里的每个对象开始，并通过如同新中心的这些对象推出新的周围区域，如此反复。良善所放射的真理之光以这种方式大大增强，变成一片光明，因为他现在沐浴在从主所发出的天堂之光中。但对那些倾向于怀疑并质询某事是否存在、真实的人来说，这些数不清、事实上无限的事物根本就看不见。在他们看来，一切事物，无论总体还是细节，完全是模糊的。他们几乎看不见作为一个整体真实存在的这些事物，仅把它们看作一个他们不确定其存在的整体。如今，人类智慧和聪明便沦落到这种境地。能巧妙推理某事是否存在现已成为智者的标志，而能推理它不存在则成了更有智慧者的标志。<br />以这个问题为例，即：被这种人称之为神秘意义的圣言内义是否存在。在相信内义存在之前，他们不可能知道存于内义的无数事物中的一个事物。这些事物如此之多，以至于以无限种类充满整个天堂。另举一例：人若推理圣治是否仅仅是普遍的，并没有延伸到具体细节，就不可能知道与天命（Providence）有关的无数奥秘。这些奥秘在数量上和每个人从开始到结束的一生，以及这个世界从创造到结束，甚至直到永远所发生的事一样多。再举一例：人若推理良善能否存在于人里面，因为人的意愿从根上堕落了，就绝无可能知道与重生有关的一切奥秘，甚至不知道一个新的意愿被主植入，并且不知道涉及这种植入的奥秘。这在其它一切事上也一样。由此可知，这种人处在何等的黑暗中，他们甚至看不见、更触及不到智慧的第一道门槛。</p>

<p align="center"><b>Potts(1905-1910) 3833</b></p><p><b>3833.</b>
And it came to pass in the evening. That this signifies the state as yet obscure, is evident from the signification of "evening," as being an obscure state (see n. 3056). Among the ancients, who were 
in congruent rituals, the feasts that were made in the evening, that is, the suppers, signified nothing else than the state of initiation which precedes conjunction, which state relatively to the state 
of conjunction is obscure. For during man's initiation into truth and thence into good, all that he learns is obscure to him; but when good is being conjoined with him, and he regards truth therefrom, 
it then becomes clear to him, and this successively more and more; for now he is no longer in doubt as to whether a thing exists, or whether it is so; but he knows that it exists, and that it is so. [2] 
When man is in this state, he then begins to know innumerable things, for he now proceeds from the good and truth which he believes and perceives as from a center to the circumferences; and in 
proportion as he proceeds, in the same proportion he sees the things which are round about, and successively more and more widely, for he is constantly pushing out and widening the boundaries. Thenceforth 
also he commences from every subject in the space within the boundaries; and from these as from new centers he throws out new circumferences, and so on. In this way the light of truth from good 
increases immeasurably, and becomes like a continuous lucidity, for the man is then in the light of heaven, which is from the Lord. But with those who are in doubt and in discussion as to whether a thing 
exists, and whether it is so, these innumerable, nay, illimitable things do not appear one whit; to them all things in both general and particular are utterly obscure, and are scarcely regarded as 
one really existing thing, but rather as one thing the existence of which is doubtful. In such a state is human wisdom and intelligence at this day, when he is deemed wise who can reason with ingenuity 
as to whether a thing exists; and he is deemed still wiser who can reason that it does not exist.  [3] For example take the proposition that there is an internal sense of the Word, which is called 
mystical: until this is believed, it is impossible for men to know the least of the innumerable things which are in the internal sense, and which are so many as to fill the whole heaven with an infinite 
variety. Another example is that the man who reasons concerning the Divine Providence, as to whether it is only universal, and not in the singulars, cannot possibly know the innumerable arcana of 
Providence, which are as many in number as are the contingencies of everyone's life from first to last, and from the creation of the world to its end; nay, even to eternity. Again: he who reasons as to 
whether it is possible for anyone to be in good, seeing that the will of man is radically depraved, can never know all the arcana relating to regeneration, nor even that a new will is implanted by the 
Lord, nor the arcana relating to this implantation; and so with everything else. From this it may be known in what obscurity such persons are, and that they do not even see, much less touch, the first 
threshold of wisdom. </p>

<p align="center"><b>Elliott(1983-1999) 3833</b></p><p><b>3833.</b>
'And so it was in the evening' means when the state was still obscure. This is clear from the meaning of 'the evening' as an obscure state, dealt with in <a href="3056.htm">3056</a>. Furthermore feasts held in the evening, 
that is, suppers, meant nothing else among the ancients who had appropriate religious observances than the introductory state which comes before an actual joining together, which is obscure compared 
with that state when the joining together has taken place. Indeed when a person is being introduced into truth and from this into good, everything he learns at that time is obscure. But once good is joined 
to him and he regards truth from the standpoint of good, everything he learns becomes clear to him, gradually and increasingly so. For he is now no longer in doubt about whether something exists 
or whether it is true but knows that it exists and is true. </p>
<p></p>
<p><b>[2]</b>
 Once a person has reached this state he starts to know countless things, for he now proceeds from the good and truth which he believes 
and perceives. He proceeds so to speak from the central point out to the peripheral regions; and in the measure that he proceeds from such good and truth, he sees in the same measure the things round 
about, and gradually more and more widely since he is constantly pushing out and extending the boundaries. Thereafter he also begins from each subject situated in the space within those boundaries, 
and from those subjects as new centres he pushes out new peripheral regions; and so on in the spaces within these. Consequently the light of truth radiating from good increases enormously and becomes 
one expanse of light, for he is now bathed in the light of heaven which shines from the Lord. But to people who are prone to doubt and who question whether something exists and is true, those countless, 
indeed limitless things are not visible at all. To them every single one is totally obscure. Those things are scarcely seen by them as a single whole which definitely exists, only as a single whole 
whose very existence they are uncertain of. Such is the condition into which human wisdom and intelligence has fallen at the present day. Being able to reason cleverly whether something exists is now 
the mark of a wise man, and being able to reason that it does not exist is the mark of one wiser still. </p>
<p></p>
<p><b>[3]</b>
 Take for example the question whether in the Word an internal sense exists which such people 
call the mystical sense. Until they believe in the existence of it they cannot know a single one of the countless things existing within that sense, so many that they fill the whole of heaven in 
unending variety. Take as another example one who reasons about whether Divine Providence is merely universal and does not extend to specific details. That person cannot know the countless arcana which 
have to do with Providence, as many in number as the occurrences in everyone's life from start to finish and in the world from its creation to its end, and even for ever. Take as yet another example 
one who reasons whether good can exist in anyone, seeing that the will of man is fundamentally depraved. He cannot possibly be aware of all the arcana that have to do with regeneration, nor even that 
a new will is implanted by the Lord and the arcana concerning this. And the same is so with everything else. From this one may recognize what obscurity surrounds such people and that they do not even 
see, let alone reach, the outskirts of wisdom. </p>

`Et fuit in vespera':  quod significet statum adhuc obscurum, constat a significatione `vesperae' quod sit status obscurus, de qua n. 3056; etiam convivia quae in vespera fiebant, seu cenae, nec 
aliud apud antiquos qui in ritualibus congruis fuerunt, significabant quam statum {1}initiationis qui praecedit {2}conjunctionem, qui status est obscurus respective ad statum conjunctionis; cum enim 
initiatur homo in verum et inde in bonum, est ei omne quod tunc discit, obscurum, at cum conjungitur ei bonum et inde spectat verum, tunc fit ei clarum, et hoc successive magis et magis, non enim 
tunc amplius in dubio est num sit aut num ita sit, sed novit quod sit et quod ita sit; cum homo in hoc statu est, tunc innumerabilia scire incipit, [2](x)procedit enim tunc a bono et vero quae credit 
et percipit, quasi a centro ad {3}peripherias, et quantum procedit, tantum illa quae circumcirca sunt, videt, et successive adhuc extensius, continue enim terminos educit et dilatat; et quoque 
dein a quavis re in spatio intra terminos incohat, et inde ut ex novis centris novas peripherias educit, et sic porro; inde lux veri a bono in immensum crescit, et fit {3}sicut continuum lucidum, nam 
in luce caeli tunc est quae a Domino; at qui in dubio sunt, et disquirunt num sit et num ita sit, illis innumerabilia illa, immo indefinita ne hilum apparent; sunt eis omnia et singula prorsus obscura, 
et {4}spectantur illa vix ut unum quod sit, sed ut unum quod non sciunt {5}num sit; in tali statu est sapientia et intelligentia humana hodie, posse ingeniose ratiocinari num sit, sapientis 
est, et ratiocinari quod non sit, {7}adhuc magis sapientis est:  [3]ut pro exemplo, num detur sensus internus Verbi quem vocant mysticum; antequam hoc creditur, ne hilum de innumerabilibus illis scire 
possunt quae in sensu interno sunt, quae tot sunt ut universum caelum cum infinita varietate impleant:  sit etiam pro exemplo, qui ratiocinatur de Providentia Divina, num sit modo universalis, 
et non in singularibus; ille nec scire potest innumerabilia illa arcana quae Providentiae sunt, quae tot sunt, quot contingentia usque a cujusvis primo vitae ad ultimum, aque mundi creatione ad ejus 
finem, immo quae in aeternum: </p>
<p>sit quoque pro exemplo, qui ratiocinatur num aliquis in bono possit esse quia voluntas hominis radicitus depravata est, is nusquam scire potest omnia illa arcana quae 
regenerationis sunt, et ne quidem quod nova voluntas implantetur a Domino, et hujus rei arcana; ita in omnibus reliquis; inde sciri potest in quali obscuro sunt illi qui tales sunt, et quod ne quidem 
primum limen sapientiae videant, minus id tangant. @1 obscurum$ @2 statum initiationis$ @3 i omnes$ @4 i etiam$ @5 spectant$ @6 an$ @7 A ip above this quodnam est$ </p>
