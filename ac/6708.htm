<h3 align="center" class="ired">属天的奥秘 第6708节</h3>
<h4 align="center"></h4><p><strong>6708.</strong>邻舍取决于良善的品质，这一点从主在路加福音（<a href="http://39-27.cn/路10.29.htm">10:29</a>-<a href="http://39-27.cn/路10.37.htm">37</a>）中的比喻明显看出来，即：落在强盗手中的人被打得半死，祭司从那边过去了，利未人也从那边过去了；惟有撒马利亚人为他包扎伤口，倒上油和酒，扶他骑上自己的牲口，带到店里去照应他；他因行仁之良善，故被称为“邻舍”。从这个比喻可以看出，那些处于良善的人是邻舍；而那些陷入邪恶的人虽然也是邻舍，却是在一个完全不同的方面为邻舍；因此，要以不同的方式利益他们。关于这个主题，蒙主的神性怜悯，我们将在以后予以讨论。</p>

<p align="center"><b>Potts(1905-1910) 6708</b></p><p><b>6708.</b>
That the neighbor is according to the quality of the good, is plain from the Lord's parable of the man who fell among thieves, whom, while half dead, the priest passed by, and also the Levite; but the 
Samaritan, when he had bound up his wounds and poured in oil and wine, set him on his own beast and brought him to an inn and took care of him; and he, because he exercised the good of charity, is called 
the "neighbor" (Luke 10:29-37). Hence it may be known that they are the neighbor who are in good; whereas they who are in evil are indeed the neighbor, but in quite a different respect; and for 
this reason they are to be benefited in a different way. But on this subject, of the Lord's Divine mercy more will be said hereafter. </p>

<p align="center"><b>Elliott(1983-1999) 6708</b></p><p><b>6708.</b>
The fact that the character of such good determines the identity of the neighbour is evident from the Lord's parable in <a href="http://bible.gospelcom.net/cgi-bin/bible?passage=Luke%2010:29-37&amp;version=ESV&amp;interface=print&amp;showfn=yes&amp;showxref">Luke 10:29-37</a> about the man who fell among robbers. Although the man was half-dead 
the priest passed by on the other side, and so did the Levite. But the Samaritan bandaged his wounds, pouring on oil and wine, and he carried him on his own animal, taking him to an inn, where he 
had him cared for. Since he exercised the good of charity he is called a neighbour. From this parable one may see that those governed by good are 'the neighbour'. Those governed by evil are, it is true, 
the neighbour too; but they are so in a completely different respect, and therefore benefits should be conferred on them in other ways. But these matters are, in the Lord's Divine mercy, to be discussed 
later on. </p>

Quod proximus sit secundum quale boni, patet a Domini parabola de illo qui Incidit in latrones, quem semimortuum sacerdos praeterivit et quoque Levita; sed, Samarita, postquam obligavit vulnera ejus 
et infudit oleum et vinum, sustulit super proprium jumentum, et duxit in deversorium, et curam ejus habuit; hic, quia bonum charitatis exercuit, proximus dicitur, Luc. x 29-37; </p>
<p>inde sciri potest quod 
`proximus' sint qui in bono; at qui in malo, quidem proximus {1}sunt, sed {2} prorsus alio respectu; et quia ita, aliter illis benefaciendum est; {3}at de his, ex Divina Domini Misericordia, in sequentibus 
dicendum. 	@1 sint$ 	@2 i in$ 	@3 sed$ </p>
