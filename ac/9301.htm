<h3 align="center" class="ired">属天的奥秘 第9301节</h3>
<h4 align="center"></h4><p><strong>9301.</strong>“不可用山羊羔母的奶煮山羊羔”表属于后一种状态的纯真之良善绝不能与属于前一种状态的纯真之真理相结合。这从“煮”、“山羊羔”和“奶”的含义清楚可知：“煮”是指结合（参看<a href="8496.htm">8496</a>节）；“山羊羔”是指纯真之良善（<a href="3519.htm">3519</a>，<a href="4871.htm">4871</a>节）；“奶”是指纯真之真理（<a href="2184.htm">2184</a>，<a href="3183.htm">3183</a>节），因此，“母奶”是指早期纯真的真理。由此明显可知，“不可用山羊羔母的奶煮山羊羔”表示属于后一种状态的纯真之良善绝不能与属于前一种状态的纯真之真理相结合。这是天堂的奥秘，这条律法就源自这个奥秘；因为赐给以色列人的一切律法，一切典章和律例都包含天堂的奥秘，它们也对应于这些奥秘。不过，必须简要说明当如何理解这个奥秘，即：属于后一种状态的纯真之良善绝不能与属于前一种状态的纯真之真理相结合。属于前一种状态的纯真是婴幼儿的纯真；属于后一种状态的纯真是处于对主之爱的良善的成年人和老年人的纯真。婴幼儿的纯真是外在的，居于彻底的无知之中；但老年人的纯真是内在的，居于智慧之中。关于这二者的区别，可参看前文（<a href="2305.htm">2305</a>，<a href="2306.htm">2306</a>，<a href="3183.htm">3183</a>，<a href="3994.htm">3994</a>，<a href="4797.htm">4797</a>节）。<br />居于智慧的纯真在于一个人知道、承认并相信，他凭自己根本不能理解任何事物，也不能意愿任何事物；因此，他不愿凭自己理解并意愿任何事物，只想靠主的能力而如此行；还在于，他认为凡他凭自己所理解的任何事都是虚假，并认为凡他凭自己所意愿的任何事都是邪恶。这种生命状态就是后一种状态的纯真的状态，所有在被称为“纯真天堂”的第三层天堂的天使都处于这种纯真状态。这就是为何他们充满智慧，因为他们所理解并意愿的一切皆来自主。但居于无知的纯真，就是诸如与婴幼儿同在的那种纯真，在于相信他们所知道并思考的一切，以及他们所意愿的一切都在他们自己里面，是他们的；因此，他们所说所行的一切皆来自他们自己。他们并不明白，这些都是幻觉。属于这种纯真的真理大部分建立在外在感官的幻觉之上；然而，随着一个人朝智慧发展，这些幻觉必须被驱散。从这简短的解释可以看出，属于后一种状态的纯真之良善绝不能与属于前一种状态的纯真之真理相结合。</p>

Thou shalt not boil a kid in its mother's milk. That this signifies that the good of innocence of the after state must not be conjoined with the truth of innocence of the former state, is evident from 
the signification of "to boil," as being to conjoin (see n. 8496); from the signification of "a kid," as being the good of innocence (n. 3519, 4871); and from the signification of "milk," as being the 
truth of innocence (n. 2184, 3183); thus the "mother's milk" denotes the truth of the first innocence. From all this it is evident that by "thou shalt not boil a kid in its mother's milk" is signified 
that the good of innocence of the after state must not be conjoined with the truth of innocence of the former state. This is the heavenly secret from which this law emanates; for all the laws and 
judgments and statutes that were given to the sons of Israel, contain secrets of heaven, to which they also correspond. But how this secret is to be understood, namely, that the good of innocence of the 
after state must not be conjoined with the truth of innocence of the former state, shall be briefly stated. The innocence of the former state is the innocence of infants and children; and the innocence 
of the after state is the innocence of adults and the aged who are in the good of love to the Lord. The innocence of infants and children is external, and dwells in dense ignorance; but the innocence 
of the aged is internal, and dwells in wisdom. (Concerning the difference between these two, see n. 2305, 2306, 3183, 3994, 4797.) [2] The innocence that dwells in wisdom consists in the man's knowing, 
acknowledging, and believing that he can understand nothing and will nothing from himself, and consequently in his not wishing to understand and will anything from himself, but only from the Lord; 
and also that whatever he supposes that he understands from himself is falsity; and whatever he supposes that he wills from himself is evil. This state of life is the state of innocence of the after 
state, in which are all who are in the third heaven, which is called "the heaven of innocence." Hence it is that such are in wisdom, because all they understand and will is from the Lord. But the 
innocence which dwells in ignorance, such as exists with infants and children, consists in believing that all they know and think, and also all they will is in themselves; and that all they speak and 
do from this thought and will is from themselves. That these are fallacies, they do not apprehend. The truths belonging to this innocence are for the most part founded upon the fallacies of the external 
senses; and these fallacies must be shaken off as the man advances toward wisdom. From these few words it can be seen that the good of innocence of the after state must not be conjoined with the truth 
of innocence of the former state. </p>

'You shall not cook a kid in its mother's milk' means that the good of innocence belonging to a later state must not be joined to the truth of innocence belonging to an earlier state. This is clear from 
the meaning of 'cooking' as joining together, dealt with in <a href="8496.htm">8496</a>; from the meaning of 'a kid' as the good of innocence, dealt with in <a href="3519.htm">3519</a>, <a href="4871.htm">4871</a>; and from the meaning of 'milk' as the truth of innocence, 
dealt with in <a href="2184.htm">2184</a>, <a href="3183.htm">3183</a>, so that 'mother's milk' is the truth of earlier innocence. From these meanings it is evident that 'you shall not cook a kid in its mother's milk' means that the good 
of innocence of a later state must not be joined to the truth of innocence of an earlier state. This is the heavenly arcanum from which that law springs; for all the laws and all the judgements and statutes 
which were given to the children of Israel contain heavenly arcana, to which they also correspond. But how this arcanum should be understood - that the good of innocence belonging to a later state 
must not be joined to the truth of innocence belonging to an earlier state - must be stated briefly. The innocence belonging to an earlier state is the innocence that exists with young children and 
older ones, but the innocence belonging to a later state is the innocence that exists with grown up and elderly people who are governed by the good of love to the Lord. The innocence that exists with 
young children and older ones is external and resides in thorough ignorance, whereas the innocence of elderly people is internal and resides in wisdom. Regarding the difference between the two, see <a href="2305.htm">2305</a>, <a href="2306.htm">2306</a>, <a href="3183.htm">3183</a>, <a href="3494.htm">3494</a>,<A name="fntext1"></a><A href="#fn1"><sup>a</sup></a> <a href="4797.htm">4797</a>.  </p>

 The innocence which resides in wisdom consists in a person's knowing, acknowledging, and believing that all by himself he cannot understand anything at all or will 
anything at all, and therefore in his refusal to try and understand or will anything all by himself, only in the power of the Lord; and also this, that whatever he thinks he understands all by himself 
is false, and whatever he thinks he wills all by himself is evil. This state of life is that of the innocence of a later state, which is that of all in the third heaven, called the heaven of innocence. 
This is why they are filled with wisdom, for what they understand and what they will comes from the Lord. But the innocence which resides in ignorance, such as that present with young children and 
older ones, consists in believing that everything they know and think, and also everything they will, is theirs within them, and that therefore everything they say and do comes from themselves. They 
have no idea that these are illusions. The truths that go with this innocence are based for the most part on the illusions of the outward senses, which however must be dispelled as a person advances 
towards wisdom. From this brief explanation it may be recognized that the good of innocence belonging to a later state must not be joined to the truth of innocence belonging to an earlier state.

Non coques haedum in lacte matris suae': quod significet quod bonum innocentiae posterioris status non conjungendum sit' cum vero innocentiae prioris status, constat ex significatione `coquere' quod 
sit conjungere, de qua n. 8496, ex significatione `haedi' quod sit bonum innocentiae, de qua n. 3519, 4871, et ex significatione `lactis' quod sit verum innocentiae, de qua n. 2184, 3183 {1}; inde `lac 
matris' est verum innocentiae primae; ex his {2} patet quod per `non coques haedum in lacte matris suae' significetur quod bonum innocentiae posterioris status `non conjungendum sit' cum vero innocentiae 
prioris status'; hoc arcanum caeleste est ex quo illa {3} lex fluit; omnes enim leges et omnia judicia et statuta quae filiis Israelis data sunt arcana caeli continent, quibus etiam correspondent. 
 Sed quomodo intelligendum sit hoc arcanum, quod nempe bonum innocentiae posterioris status non conjungendum sit vero innocentiae prioris status, paucis dicetur: innocentia prioris status est innocentia 
quae est infantum et puerorum, et innocentia posterioris status est (o)innocentia quae est adultorum et senum qui in bono amoris in Dominum sunt; innocentia infantum (o)et puerorum est {4} externa 
et habitat in densa ignorantia, at innocentia senum est interna et habitat in sapientia; de differentia utriusque videatur n. 2305, 2306, 3183, 3495, 4797. 	[2] Innocentia quae habitat in sapientia 
est scire, agnoscere, et credere quod nihil intelligere et nihil velle possit {5} a semet, et inde quod nihil velit intelligere et velle a semet sed solum a Domino; tum quicquid putat se intelligere 
a semet sit falsum, et quicquid putat (o)se velle a semet sit malum; hic status vitae est status innocentiae posterioris (d)status, in quo sunt omnes qui in tertio caelo, quod caelum innocentiae vocatur; 
inde est quod illi sint in sapientia, quia quod intelligunt et quod volunt est a Domino; sed (x)innocentia quae habitat in ignorantia, qualis apud infantes et pueros, est credere quod omnia quae 
sciunt et cogitant, et quoque quae volunt, sint in se, et quod omnia quae inde loquuntur et faciunt sint a se; quod haec fallaciae sint non capiunt; vera quae illius innocentiae sunt fundantur quoad 
maximam partem super fallaciis sensuum externorum, quae tamen discutiendae sunt sicut provehitur homo {6} ad sapientiam; ex his paucis constare potest quod bonum innocentiae posterioris status non conjungendum 
sit cum vero innocentiae prioris status. @1 After innocentiae primae but d$ @2 inde$ @3 Before bonum$ @haec$ @4 i innocentia$ @5 Before intelligere$ @6 d provehitur homo i provehuntur$ </p>
