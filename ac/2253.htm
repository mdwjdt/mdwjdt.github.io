<h3 align="center" class="ired">属天的奥秘 第2253节</h3>
<h4 align="center"></h4><p><strong>2253.</strong>“你还要毁灭那城吗？不为城当中这五十个义人饶恕那地方吗”表出于爱的代求，即他们不应灭亡。这从“五十”、“义人”，以及“当中”，即“那城”的含义（对此，参看<a href="2252.htm">2252</a>节）清楚可知。所有这些表述都意味着出于爱的代求，即他们不应灭亡（至于代求，参看<a href="2250.htm">2250</a>节）。代求是出于爱，这也是显而易见的。对主而言，祂在世时，所具有的生命仅仅是对全人类的爱之生命，祂热切地渴望永远拯救人类。这生命完全是属天的生命，祂藉此生命将祂自己与神性，并神性与祂自己融合。因为存在本身，或耶和华无非是怜悯，这怜悯是对全人类之爱的体现，这生命是绝不可能存在于任何人身上的纯然之爱的生命。人若不知道何为生命，以及生命的性质取决于爱的性质，就不会理解这一切。由此明显可知，人越爱他的邻舍，就越汲取主的生命。</p>

Wilt thou also destroy and not spare the place for the sake of the fifty righteous that are in the midst of it? That this signifies intercession from love-that they should not perish-is evident from 
the signification of "fifty," and of "righteous," as also of "the midst of it," that is, of the city (concerning which just above, n. 2252), all of which things involve intercession from love, and that 
they should not perish. (As regards the intercession, see above, n. 2250.) That it was from love is also manifest. With the Lord, when He was in the world, there was no other life than the life of love 
toward the universal human race, which He ardently desired to eternally save. This is the veriest celestial life, by which He united Himself to the Divine, and the Divine to Himself-for Esse itself, 
or Jehovah, is nothing else than Mercy, which is of love to the universal human race-and that life was one of pure love, which is never possible with any man. They who do not know what life is, and 
that the life is such as the love, do not comprehend this. This shows that insofar as anyone loves his neighbor, insofar he partakes of the Lord's life. </p>

<p align="center"><b>Elliott(1983-1999) 2253</b></p><p><b>2253.</b>
'Will You also destroy and not spare the place for the sake of the fifty righteous persons who are in the midst of it?' means intercession made from love that they should not perish. This is clear from 
the meaning of 'fifty', also of 'righteous', as well as of 'the midst of it', that is, of the city, dealt with above in <a href="2252.htm">2252</a>. All these expressions together imply intercession made from love, and that 
those persons should not perish. Regarding this intercession, see above in <a href="2250.htm">2250</a>. That it is made from love is also evident. With the Lord, when He was in the world, no other life was present than 
the life of love towards the whole human race, which He passionately desired to save eternally. That life is wholly celestial life, by which He united Himself to the Divine, and the Divine to Himself 
- for Being (Esse) itself, or Jehovah, is nothing else than mercy, which is the manifestation of love towards the whole human race - and that life was the life of pure love, which life cannot possibly 
exist with any human being. People who do not know what life is, and that the nature of the life is determined by that of the love, do not comprehend this. From this it is evident that in the measure 
anyone loves the neighbour he draws on the life that is the Lord's. </p>

</p><b>2253.</b>
`Num etiam delebis, et non parces loco propter quinquaginta justos, qui in medio ejus': quod significet intercessionem ex amore quod non perirent, constat ex significatione `quinquaginta,' tum `justi,' 
ut et `medii ejus seu urbis,' de qua mox supra n. 2252, quae omnia involvunt intercessionem ex amore, et quod illi non perirent; quod intercessionem attinet, videatur supra n. 2250; quod ex amore, 
etiam patet: apud Dominum cum fuit in mundo, non fuit alia vita quam vita amoris erga universum genus humanum, quod in aeternum salvare arderet; illa vita est ipsissima caelestis, per quam univit Se 
Divino et Divinum Sibi; ipsum enim Esse, seu Jehovah, non aliud est quam misericordia, quae est amoris erga universum genus humanum; et vita illa fuit puri amoris quae nusquam dabilis est apud aliquem 
hominem: qui nesciunt quid vita, et quod talis vita sit qualis amor, id non capiunt; inde patet quod quantum aliquis amat proximum, tantum a vita Domini habeat. </p>
