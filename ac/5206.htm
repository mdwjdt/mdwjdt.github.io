<h3 align="center" class="ired">属天的奥秘 第5206节</h3>
<h4 align="center"></h4><p><strong>5206.</strong>“这长相丑陋，肌肉干瘦的母牛吃尽”表不属于信，也不属于仁的虚假将要驱逐。这从“吃尽”、“长相丑陋的母牛”和“肌肉干瘦”的含义清楚可知：“吃尽”是指毁灭（参看<a href="5149.htm">5149</a>，<a href="5157.htm">5157</a>节），但在此是指驱逐，因为属世层里面的真理在从属灵层的属天层那里接受生命，并由此重生之前，可以说被虚假驱逐；“长相丑陋的母牛”是指不属于信之物，如刚才所述（<a href="5203.htm">5203</a>节）；“肌肉干瘦”是指不属于仁之物，如前所述（<a href="5204.htm">5204</a>节）。</p>

<p align="center"><b>Potts(1905-1910) 5206</b></p><p><b>5206.</b>
And the kine evil in look and thin in flesh did eat up. That this signifies that the falsities that were not of faith nor of charity banished, is evident from the signification of "eating up," as being 
to consume (see n. 5149, 5157), but here to banish, because until the truths in the natural have been made alive and consequently regenerate by the celestial of the spiritual, they are as it were banished 
by falsities; and from the signification of "kine evil in look," as being that were not of faith (of which just above, n. 5203); and from the signification of "thin in flesh," as being that were 
not of charity (of which also above, n. 5204). </p>

<p align="center"><b>Elliott(1983-1999) 5206</b></p><p><b>5206.</b>
'And the cows bad in appearance and thin-fleshed devoured.....' means that falsities which were not expressions of faith and were not embodiments of charity would banish..... This is clear from the meaning 
of 'devouring' as consuming, dealt with in <a href="5149.htm">5149</a>, <a href="5157.htm">5157</a>, here as banishing because truths present in the natural, before they have received life through the celestial of the spiritual and so have 
been regenerated, have been so to speak banished by falsities; from the meaning of 'cows bad in appearance' as things which are not expressions of faith, dealt with just above in <a href="5203.htm">5203</a>; and from the meaning 
of 'thin-fleshed' as things which are not embodiments of charity, also dealt with above, in <a href="5204.htm">5204</a>. </p>

</p><b>5206.</b>
`Et comederunt vaccae malae aspectu et graciles carne': quod significet quod falsa quae non fidei et non charitatis exterminarent, constat ex significatione `comedere' quod sit consumere, de qua n. 
5149, 5157, hic autem exterminare, quia vera quae in naturali, antequam vivificata sunt per caeleste spiritualis, proinde regenerata, quasi exterminata sunt per falsa; ex significatione `vaccarum malarum 
aspectu' quod sint quae non fidei, de qua mox supra n. 5203; et ex significatione `gracilium carne' quod sint quae non charitatis, de qua etiam supra n. 5204. </p>
