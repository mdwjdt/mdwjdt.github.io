<h3 align="center" class="ired">属天的奥秘 第3108节</h3>
<h4 align="center"></h4><p><strong>3108.</strong>这两节论述了真理引入良善。但是，若人的心智只被诸如尘世之光中所看到的那类事物光照，同时没有被诸如天堂之光（属于尘世之光的事物便被这光所光照）中所看到的那类事物光照，那么该引入的性质就不会轻易融入他的思维模式中。缺乏良善，因而缺乏信仰的人，脑子里除了由尘世之光中所看到的物体形成的观念外，就没有任何其它观念了。这些人不知道何为属灵之物，甚至不知道何为真正意义上的理性，只知道属世之物，他们将一切都归于这属世之物。这就是为何内义上所阐述的有关真理引入良善这些事对他们来说太过遥远，以至于根本没有任何意义的原因。然而，对那些处于天堂之光的人来说，它们被视为最宝贵的。<br />至于真理引入良善，情况是这样：真理在被引入并正确联结之前，的确居于人身上，但尚未变成他的，或他自己的。不过，真理一旦被引入他的良善，就变成他自己的了。这时，它便从人的外部记忆消失，转入内部记忆。或也可说，它在属世人或外在人中不复存在，然后转入理性人或内在人，在那里披上这个人自己，构成他的人性，也就是他作为人的品性。正与人的良善联结的一切真理都是这种情况；正与他视之为良善的邪恶联结的虚假也是这种情况。不同之处在于，真理打开理性，从而使人变得理性；而虚假关闭理性，使人变得没有理性，尽管那时在他所处的黑暗中，他自己觉得比谁都理性。</p>

These two verses treat of the initiation of truth into good; but what is the nature of this initiation does not easily fall into the idea of thought with anyone who has been enlightened only by such 
things as are of the light of the world, and not at the same time by such things as are of the light of heaven, from which light the things which are of the light of the world may themselves be enlightened. 
They who are not in good, and thence in faith, have no other ideas of thought than those which have been formed from objects of the light of the world. These do not know that there is anything 
spiritual, nor indeed what the rational is in the genuine sense, but only the natural to which they attribute all things; and this is the reason why these things which are said in the internal sense concerning 
the initiation of truth into good, are to them too remote to appear to amount to anything; when yet to those who are in the light of heaven these are among their precious things. As regards 
the initiation of truth into good the case is this: Before truth has been initiated and rightly conjoined, it is indeed with man, but it has not been made as it were of him, or as his own; but as soon 
as it is being initiated into his good, it is appropriated to him; and it then vanishes from his external memory, and passes into the internal memory; or what is the same, it vanishes from the natural 
or external man, and passes into the rational or internal man, and puts on the very man, and makes his human, that is, his quality as to the human. Such is the case with all truth that is being conjoined 
with a man's good; such also is the case with the falsity that is being conjoined with evil which he calls good; but the difference is that the former opens the rational, and so makes the man rational; 
whereas the latter closes the rational and makes the man irrational; although he seems to himself, in the darkness in which he then is, to be pre-eminently rational. </p>

These two verses deal with the introduction of truth into good. But the nature of this introduction does not fit easily into the pattern of thought of anyone whose mind is illumined solely by such things 
as are seen in the light of the world, and not at the same time by those seen in the light of heaven, by which those belonging to the light of the world are illumined. People who are devoid of good 
and consequently of faith have no other ideas in their minds than those formed from objects seen in the light of the world. They do not know what the spiritual is, nor even what the rational is in 
the genuine sense, but only the natural, to which they ascribe everything. Here also is the reason why those things stated in the internal sense about the introduction of truth into good appear to them 
too remote to mean anything at all. Yet to those who see in the light of heaven they are considered most precious. </p>

<p><b>[2]</b>
 With regard to the introduction of truth into good, before truth has been introduced 
and rightly joined it does indeed reside with man, yet it has not so to speak become his or his own. But as soon as it is introduced into its own good it does become his own. It goes out of his 
external memory and passes over into the internal memory. Or what amounts to the same, it ceases to exist in the natural or external man, and passes over into the rational or internal man, where it 
clothes itself with the person himself and constitutes his humanity, that is, his own human character. This is the situation with all truth that is being joined to its good, as also in a similar way 
with falsity that is being joined to evil which it calls good. The difference however is that truth opens the rational and so makes a person rational, whereas falsity closes the rational and makes him 
irrational, though he seems to himself while in the darkness enveloping him at this time to be more rational than others. </p>

Agitur in binis his versibus de initiatione veri in bonum, sed qualis haec initiatio sit, non facile cadit in ideam cogitationis apud aliquem qui modo illustratus est a talibus quae sunt lucis mundi, 
nisi simul a talibus quae sunt lucis caeli, ex qua illa quae sunt lucis mundi, illustrentur; qui non in bono sunt et inde in fide, non alias ideas cogitationis habent quam quae formatae sunt ab objectis 
lucis mundi; ii nec sciunt {1}quid spirituale est, ne quidem quid rationale in genuino sensu, sed modo naturale, cui {2}tribuunt omnia; quae etiam causa est quod haec quae in sensu interno de initiatione 
veri in bonum dicuntur, iis remotiora sint quam ut appareant quod sint aliquid; cum tamen illa sunt iis qui in luce caeli, inter pretiosa.  [2] Ita se habet cum initiatione veri in bonum quod 
antequam verum initiatum est ac rite conjunctum, sit quidem apud hominem, sed non factam sicut ejus, aut sicut proprium; ut primum autem initiatur ejus bono, tunc appropriatur ei; evanescit tunc e memoria 
ejus externa, et transit in internam, seu quod idem, evanescit in naturali seu externo homine, et transit in rationalem seu internum, et induit ipsum {3}ac facit humanum ejus, hoc est, quale ejus 
quoad humanum; ita se habet cum omni vero quod conjungitur bono ejus; similiter etiam se habet cum falso quod conjungitur malo quod vocat bonum; sed differentia est quod illud aperiat rationale et sic 
faciat hominem rationalem, hoc autem claudat rationale et faciat hominem irrationalem; tametsi videatur sibi in tenebris in quibus tunc est, quod supra alios rationalis sit. @1 quod I$ @2 i etiam$ @3 seu$ </p>
