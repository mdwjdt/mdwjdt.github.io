<h3 align="center" class="ired">属天的奥秘 第6467节</h3>
<h4 align="center"></h4><p><strong>6467.</strong>由此明显可知，人的生命本质上并不是他自己的，因此，没有人单凭自己思考和意愿；因为人的生命在于思考和意愿。生命只有一种，就是主的生命，这生命流入所有人，但以各种不同的方式的被接受。事实上，接受它的方式取决于一个人通过他在世的生活而烙印在他灵魂上的品质。正因如此，在恶人当中，良善与真理被转变为邪恶与虚假；但在善人当中，良善作为良善被接受，真理作为真理被接受。这好比从太阳流入物体的光。在这些物体里面，光以不同方式经历了各种各样的修改和变化，这取决于物体的组成部分所取的形式；光由此被转化为或阴郁或欢快的色彩；因此，这也取决于接受者的品质。人活在世上时，以同样的方式照着接受主生命的方式而将一种品质烙印在构成其内层的最纯粹的物质上。要知道，从主所获得的生命是对全人类的爱之生命。</p>

From this it is evident that no man has life from himself, and therefore neither can he think and will from himself, for the life of man consists in thinking and willing. For there is one only life, 
namely, that of the Lord, which flows into all, but is variously received, and this according to the quality which a man has induced on his soul by his life in the world. Hence with the evil, goods and 
truths are turned into evils and falsities; but with the good, goods are received as goods, and truths as truths. This may be compared to the light which flows into objects from the sun, which is diversely 
modified and variegated in the objects in accordance with the form of their parts, and hence is turned into colors either sorrowful or gladsome, thus in accordance with the quality. In like manner 
while a man lives in this world he induces on the purest substances that belong to his interior a quality, according to which the Lord's life is received. Be it known that the life from the Lord 
is the life of love toward the universal human race. </p>

<p align="center"><b>Elliott(1983-1999) 6467</b></p><p><b>6467.</b>
From this it is evident that no one's life is ever intrinsically his own, so that no one left to himself can have any thought or will; for a person's life consists in the exercise of thought and will. 
There is only one kind of life - the Lord's - a life that flows into all people, but is received in varying ways. Indeed the way it is received is determined by the character a person has stamped on 
his soul through the life he leads in the world. This being so, forms of good and truths are turned among the wicked into evils and falsities, but among good people forms of good are received as forms 
of good and truths as truths. This may be compared to light flowing from the sun into objects. In them it undergoes all kinds of modification and variation in differing ways, as determined by the forms 
their constituent parts take, and it is thereby converted either into dismal or into cheerful colours, thus as determined by the character of the recipients. In much the same way, while he lives in 
the world a person stamps on the purest substances composing his interiors a character that determines the way in which the Lord's life is received. It should be recognized that the life received from 
the Lord is the life of love towards the entire human race. </p>

</p><b>6467.</b>
Exinde patet quod nusquam aliquis homo vitam habeat a se, ita nec a se cogitare et velle possit, nam vita hominis consistit in cogitare et velle; unica enim est vita, nempe Domini, quae influit in omnes, 
sed varie recipitur, et quidem secundum quale quod homo induxit animae suae per vitam in mundo; inde apud malos bona et vera vertuntur in mala et falsa, at apud bonos recipiuntur bona ut bona et 
vera ut vera:  hoc comparari potest luci quae a sole influit in objecta, {1}illa in his modificatur et variegatur diversimode secundum formam partium, et inde vertitur in colores vel tristes vel laetos, 
ita secundum quale; similiter homo dum vivit in mundo, inducit substantiis purissimis quae sunt interiorum ejus, {2}qualitatem secundum quam vita Domini recipitur.  Sciendum quod vita (c)a Domino 
sit vita amoris erga universum genus humanum. @1 quae$ @2 secundum illarum formam recipitur vita Domini$ </p>
