From all this it is now evident whence the origin of neighbor is to be drawn by the man of the church; and that everyone is the neighbor in the degree in which he is near the Lord; and because the Lord 
is in the good of charity, that the neighbor is according to the quality of the good, thus according to the quality of the charity.            EXODUS 2 </p>
<p>     1. And there went a man from the house 
of Levi, and took a daughter of Levi.      2. And the woman conceived, and bare a son; and she saw him, that he was good, and she hid him three months.      3. And she could no longer hide him; 
and she took for him an ark of rush, and daubed it with bitumen and with pitch; and she put the child therein, and laid him in the sedge at the bank of the river.      4. And his sister stood afar off, 
to know what would be done to him.      5. And Pharaoh's daughter came down to wash at the river; and her girls were going at the side of the river; and she saw the ark in the midst of the sedge, 
and sent her handmaid, and took it.      6. And she opened it, and saw him, the child; and behold the boy wept. And she had compassion on him, and said, This is one of the Hebrews' children.      7. 
And his sister said to Pharaoh's daughter, Shall I go and call thee a woman, a nurse, from the Hebrew women, that she may suckle the child for thee?      8. And Pharaoh's daughter said to her, Go. And 
the girl went, and called the mother of the child.      9. And Pharaoh's daughter said to her, Take this child to thee, and suckle him for me, and I will give thee thy wages. And the woman took the 
child and suckled him.      10. And the child grew, and she brought him to Pharaoh's daughter, and he was to her as a son. And she called his name Moses, and said, Because I drew him out of the waters.  
    11. And it came to pass in those days, and Moses grew, and he went out unto his brethren, and saw their burdens; and he saw an Egyptian man smiting a Hebrew man, one of his brethren.      
12. And he looked forth hither and thither, and saw that there was no man, and he smote the Egyptian, and hid him in the sand.      13. And he went out the second day, and held two Hebrew men quarreling; 
and he said to the wicked one, Wherefore smitest thou thy companion?      14. And he said, Who set thee for a man, a prince, and a judge over us? Sayest thou to kill me, as thou killedst the Egyptian? 
And Moses feared, and said, Surely the word is known.      15. And Pharaoh heard this word, and he sought to kill Moses. And Moses fled from before Pharaoh, and dwelt in the land of Midian, and 
he dwelt by a well.      16. And the priest of Midian had seven daughters, and they came, and drew, and filled the troughs, to give drink to their father's flock.      17. And the shepherds came, 
and drove them away; and Moses arose, and helped them; and he gave drink to their flock.      18. And they came unto Reuel their father, and he said, Wherefore hasted ye to come today?      19. And 
they said, An Egyptian man delivered us out of the hand of the shepherds; and also drawing he drew for us, and gave drink to the flock.      20. And he said unto his daughters, And where is he? Why is 
this that ye have left the man? Call him, that he may eat bread.      21. And Moses was willing to dwell with the man; and he gave Moses Zipporah his daughter.      22. And she bare a son, and he 
called his name Gershom; for he said, I have been a sojourner in a strange land.      23. And it came to pass in these many days that the king of Egypt died; and the sons of Israel sighed by reason of 
the bondage, and they cried, and their cry came up unto God by reason of the bondage.      24. And God heard their groaning, and God remembered His covenant with Abraham, with Isaac, and with Jacob.  
    25. And God saw the sons of Israel, and God took knowledge. </p>

From all this one may now see what anyone belonging to the Church should make the origin of the neighbour reside in, and that the closer a person is to the Lord the more he is the neighbour. One may 
also see that because the Lord is present within the good of charity, a person is the neighbour according to the nature of the good and so of the charity in him. </p>

Ex his nunc constat unde origo proximi ab homine Ecclesiae ducenda; et quod quisque proximus sit in eo gradu quo propior est Domino; et quia Dominus est in bono charitatis, quod proximus sit secundum 
quale boni, ita secundum quale charitatis. {1} 	1 In A S i notes as follows with which cp n.6818-6824: </p>
<p>	   (In sequente transactione, si Domino ita placet), 		de proximo, quod sit homo in singulari 		de 
proximo, quod sit societas plurium magis 		de proximo, quod sit patria adhuc magis 		de proximo, quod sit genus humanum adhuc magis 		de proximo, quod sit Ecclesia adhuc magis 		de proximo, 
quod sit Regnum Domini adhuc magis 		de proximo, ita quod sit solus Dominus: </p>
<p>	   nam qui patriam amat, seu bonum publicum, in altera vita Regnum 	   Domini amant, nam ibi tunc eorum patria. CAPUT 
II 	1.  Et ivit vir e domo Levi, et duxit filiam Levi. 	2.  Et concepit mulier, et peperit filium, et vidit illum quod bonus ille, et abscondit illum tribus mensibus. 	3.  Et non potuit amplius 
abscondere illum, et accepit sibi capsam junci, et bituminavit illam bitumine et pice, et posuit in illi natum, et posuit in alga ad ripam fluminis. 	4.  Et stabat soror ejus e longinquo ad cognoscendum 
(x)quid fieret illi. 	5.  Et descendit filia Pharaonis ad lavandum ad flumen; et puellae ejus euntes ad latus fluminis, et vidit capsam in medio algae et misit ancillam suam, et accepit illam. 	6. 
 Et aperuit, et vidit illum natum, et ecce puer flens; et miserta super illum, et dixit, De natis Hebraeorum hic. 	7.  Et dixit soror ejus ad filiam Pharaonis, Num ibo et vocabo tibi mulierem nutricem 
ex Hebraeis, et lactet tibi natum? 	8.  Et dixit illi filia Pharaonis, Abi, et ivit puella, et vocavi matrem nati. 	9.  Et dixit ei filia Pharaonis, Adduc tibi natum hunc, et lacta illum mihi, 
et ego dabo mercedem tuam; et accepit mulier natum et lactavit illum. 	10.  Et crevit natus, et adduxit illum filiae Pharaonis, et fui ei in filium, et vocavit nomen illius Moscheh, et dixit, Quia ex 
aquis eduxi illum. 	11.  Et factum in diebus illis, et crevit Moscheh, et exivit a fratres suos, et vidit onera illorum, et vidit virum Aegyptium percutientem virum Hebraeum e fratribus suis. 	12. 
 Et prospexit huc et illuc, et vidit quod nullus vir, et percussit Aegyptium, et abscondidit illum in arena. 	13.  Et exivit die altero, et ecce duo viri Hebraei altercantes, et dixit improbo, Quare 
percutis socium tuum? 	14.  Et dixit, Quis posuit te ad virum principem et judicem super nos? Num ad occidendum me tu dicis, quemadmodum occidisti Aegyptium? et timuit Moscheh et dixit, Certe notum est 
verbum. 	15.  Et audivit Pharao verbum hoc, et quaesivit occidere Moschen; et fugit Moscheh a coram Pharaone, et habitavit in terra Midian, et habitavit juxta puteum. 	16.  Et sacerdoti Midianis 
septem filiae, et venerunt et hauserunt, et impleverunt canaliculos, ad potandum gregem patris sui. 	17.  Et venerunt pastores, et depulerunt illas; et surrexit Moscheh, et adjuvit illas, et potavit 
gregem earum. 	18.  Et venerunt ad Reuelem patrem suum; et dixit, Quapropter festinastis venire hodie? 	19.  Et dicebant, Vir Aegyptius liberavit nos e manu pastorum, et etiam hauriendo hausit nobis, 
et potavit gregem. 	20.  Et dixit ad filias suas, Et ubi ille? quare hoc reliquistis virum? vocate illum, et edat panem. 	21.  Et voluit Moscheh habitare cum viro, et dedit Zipporam filiam suam Moschi. 	22. 
 Et peperit filium, et vocavit nomen ejus Gerschom, quia dixit, Peregrinus sum in terra aliena. 	23.  Et factum in diebus multis his, et moriebatur rex Aegypti, et suspirabant filii Israelis 
e servitio, et clamabant; et ascendit clamor illorum ad DEUM e servitio. 	24.  Et audivit DEUS gemitum illorum, et recordatus est DEUS foederis Sui cum Abrahamo, cum Jischako, et cum Jacobo. 	25. 
 Et vidit DEUS filios Israelis, et cognovit DEUS. </p>
