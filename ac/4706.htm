<h3 align="center" class="ired">属天的奥秘 第4706节</h3>
<h4 align="center"></h4><p><strong>4706.</strong>“他们父亲的”表古教会的和初代（基督）教会的。这从“父亲”的含义清楚可知，此处的“父亲”或雅各是指古教会，如前所述（<a href="4680.htm">4680</a>e节）。关于同样是指初代基督教会，可参看前文（<a href="4690.htm">4690</a>e节）。初代教会是指一开始的基督教会。总的来说，圣言描述了四个不同的教会。存在于大洪水之前的教会名为人；该教会被称为上古教会。然后是存在于大洪水之后的教会；该教会被称为古教会。还有存在于雅各后代当中的教会；不过，该教会不是一个教会，而是一个教会的代表；这代表也被称为一个宗教表象。再就是主降临后所建的教会，被称为基督教会。这个教会刚开始的时候，被称作初代教会。</p>

Of their father. That this signifies of the Ancient and of the Primitive Church, is evident from the signification here of "father," or Jacob, as being the Ancient Church (of which above, n. 4680); that 
the Primitive Christian Church is likewise signified; may also be seen above (n. 4690). By the Primitive Church is meant the Christian Church in its beginning. In general four churches distinct from 
one another are treated of in the Word. There is the church which existed before the flood and was named Man; this is called the Most Ancient Church. Next is the one that existed after the flood, which 
is called the Ancient Church. Then followed that with the posterity of Jacob, which was not a church, but the representative of a church; which representative is also called a religiosity. And there 
is the one that was set up after the Lord's coming, which is called the Christian Church. It is this in its beginning that is called the Primitive Church. </p>

'Of their father' means of the Ancient Church and of the Primitive Church. This is clear from the meaning of 'father' here, who in this case is Jacob, as the Ancient Church, dealt with above in <a href="4680.htm">4680</a> 
(end). Regarding the Primitive Christian Church being meant too, see <a href="4690.htm">4690</a> (end), the term Primitive Church being used to mean the Christian Church when it first began. In general the Word describes four 
separate Churches. There is the Church existing before the Flood, named Man; this is called the Most Ancient Church. Then there is the Church existing after the Flood; this is referred to as the Ancient 
Church. Also there is the Church existing among the descendants of Jacob which was not a Church but a representative of the Church, which is also called a semblance of religion. And there is the 
Church which was established after the Lord's Coming and is called the Christian Church; this Church when it first began is referred to as the Primitive Church. </p>

`Patris illorum': quod sit Antiquae et Primitivae Ecclesiae, constat a significatione `patris' hic seu Jacobi quod sit Antiqua Ecclesia, de qua supra n. 4680 f; quod etiam sit Ecclesia Primitiva 
Christiana quae significatur, videatur n. 4690 f; per Ecclesiam Primitivam intelligitur Christiana in suo primordio: sunt in genere quatuor Ecclesiae inter se distinctae, de quibus agitur in Verbo; 
est illa quae fuerat ante diluvium, et `Homo' appellata {1}; haec est quae vocatur Antiquissima Ecclesia; </p>
<p>est dein quae fuerat post diluvium; haec est quae dicitur Antiqua Ecclesia; tum est illa quae 
apud Jacobi posteros, quae non fuit Ecclesia sed repraesentativum Ecclesiae; hoc etiam vocatur religiosum; et est quae post Adventum Domini instaurata est et vocatur Ecclesia Christiana, haec est 
quae {2} in suo primordio (o)dicitur Ecclesia Primitiva.      @1 vocata$      @2 sed$ </p>
