<h3 align="center" class="ired">属天的奥秘 第994节</h3>
<h4 align="center"></h4><p><strong>994.</strong>“一切活着的爬物”表包含活的良善的一切乐趣。这从前面所说“爬物”的含义明显可知。人皆可清楚看出，“爬物”在此表一切洁净的畜类和鸟类，因为经上说它们可作食物。从严格意义上说，“爬物”是那些最龌龊（如利未记<a href="http://39-27.cn/利11.27.htm">11:27</a>，<a href="http://39-27.cn/利11.29.htm">29</a>，<a href="http://39-27.cn/利11.30.htm">30</a>所提到的那些）和不洁之物。但从广义上说，如此处，它们是所给予作食物的活物。它们在此被称“爬物”，是因为它们表乐趣。在圣言中，人的情感用“洁净的畜类”来表示，如前所述。不过，由于人只会在自己的乐趣中感知这些情感，以致把它们看为乐趣，故它们在此被称为“爬物”。<br />乐趣有两种，即意愿的乐趣和觉知的乐趣。一般来说，有占有土地和财富的乐趣；有荣誉地位和为国家服务的乐趣；有婚姻之爱和舔犊之爱的乐趣；有友谊和交际的乐趣；有阅读、写作、求知、变得智慧的乐趣，等等。还有感官的乐趣，如听觉的乐趣，通常来自音乐和歌声的甜美；视觉的乐趣，通常来自各种事物多样化的美丽；嗅觉的乐趣，来自香甜的气味；味觉的乐趣，来自食物和饮品的美味和营养；以及来自众多愉悦感的触觉的乐趣。这些不同种类的乐趣由于是在肉体中被感受到的，故被称为肉体的乐趣。但是，乐趣若不通过某种内在情感产生并持续产生，就不会在肉体中产生；而内在情感若不源于功用和目的在其中的更内在的情感，也不会产生。<br />这些具有适当秩序的内在情感区域始于至内在之物，人活在肉身时觉察不到它们。绝大多数人几乎不知道它们的存在，更不知道它们是乐趣的源头。然而，若不通过那些具有秩序的内在事物，没有任何事物会在外在事物中产生。乐趣只不过是终极效果。除了那些进行反思的人外，内在事物不会显明给活在肉身的任何人。在来生，它们会首次显现，事实上，主会照着它们所在的秩序将其提升天堂。内在情感及其喜悦会在精灵界显现；较为内在的情感及其快乐会在天使灵天堂显现；更为内在的情感及其一切幸福则会在天使天堂显现。因为天堂有三层，一层比一层内在、完美和幸福（参看<a href="459.htm">459</a>，<a href="684.htm">684</a>节）。在来生，这就是这些内在事物相继展开并显现自己的次序。不过，活在肉身时，人的观念和思维总是出于肉体之物，故而这些事物仿佛沉睡了一般，因为它们被浸没在了肉体之物中。然而，凡进行反思之人都能明显看出，一切乐趣的性质都如同有序排列的内在情感的性质，它们通过这些情感获得其全部本质和品质。<br />由于有序排列的内在情感会在终极或最外在事物，即肉体中被感觉为乐趣，故它们被称为“爬物”。不过，它们仅仅是肉体之物，也就是内在事物的产物。仅通过视觉及其乐趣，谁都能清楚明白这一点。若内在视觉不存在，眼睛绝不能看。眼睛的视觉出自内在视觉，因此，肉体死亡后，人具有和活在肉身时一样的视觉天赋，事实上，比在肉身时看得还要清晰。不过，他看到的不是世俗和肉体之物，而是来生（即灵界）之物。那些活在肉身时看不见的盲人到了来生，同样享有视觉天赋，和那些视觉敏锐的人一模一样。这也是为何人在睡梦中能看得和清醒时一样清晰的原因。就我的内在视觉而言，我能看到来生之物，甚至比看尘世之物还要清楚。由此明显可知，外在视觉出自内在视觉，而内在视觉又出自更为内在的视觉，依次类推。这同样适用于所有其它感觉和各种乐趣。<br />在圣言其它地方，乐趣同样被称为“爬物”。这些地方同样对洁净的爬物和不洁净的爬物，即其快乐是活的或天堂般的乐趣和其快乐是死的或地狱般的乐趣作了明确区分。如何西阿书：<br />当那日，我必为他们与田野的野兽和空中的飞鸟，并土地上的爬物立约。（何西阿书<a href="http://39-27.cn/何2.18.htm">2:18</a>）<br />此处，“田野的野兽，空中的飞鸟和土地上的爬物”表诸如前面所提到的居于人里面的事物。这一点从所论述的主题是一个新教会明显可知。诗篇：<br />愿天和地、海洋和爬在其中的一切都赞美耶和华。（诗篇<a href="http://39-27.cn/诗69.34.htm">69:34</a>）<br />“海洋和爬在其中的一切”不可能赞美耶和华，而是它们所表示的人里面活着的事物通过里面的活物赞美耶和华。<br />赞美耶和华，野兽和一切牲畜、爬物和有翅膀的鸟儿。（诗篇<a href="http://39-27.cn/诗148.10.htm">148:10</a>）<br />这里的意思也一样。“爬物”无非表乐趣所源自的善情，这一点也可从这人民中的爬物不洁的事实明显看出来，如从以下经文所清楚看到的：<br />诗篇：<br />耶和华啊，遍地满了你的丰富；那里有海，又大又广，其中有无数的爬物；它们都倚靠你按时赐给它们食物。你给它们，它们便收集；你张手，它们饱得美食。（诗篇<a href="http://39-27.cn/诗104.24.htm">104:24</a>，<a href="http://39-27.cn/诗104.25.htm">25</a>，<a href="http://39-27.cn/诗104.27.htm">27</a>，<a href="http://39-27.cn/诗104.28.htm">28</a>）<br />此处“海”的内义表属灵之物，“爬物”表由此活着的一切事物。“按时赐给它们食物，它们饱得美食”描述的是享受。以西结书：<br />这河水所到之处，一切爬行的生物都必存活，并且因这水流到那里，使那里的水新鲜，因此里面有极多的鱼，这河水所到之处，百物都必存活。（以西结书<a href="http://39-27.cn/结47.9.htm">47:9</a>）<br />这指的是新耶路撒冷流出的水。这些水表出于属天源头的属灵之物。“爬行的生物”表对良善的情感和源于这些情感的乐趣，既有肉体的乐趣，也有感官的乐趣。后者（即肉体和感官的乐趣）通过“水”，就是出于属天源头的属灵之物存活，这是显而易见的。<br />污秽的乐趣起源于自我中心及其污秽的欲望，故也被称为“爬物”。这一点明显可见于以西结书：<br />我进去一看，看哪，在四面墙上画着各种形状的爬物和可憎的走兽，并以色列家一切的偶像。（以西结书<a href="http://39-27.cn/结8.10.htm">8:10</a>）<br />此处，“各种形状的爬物”表污秽的乐趣，这些乐趣内在是恶欲，而仇恨、报复、残忍和奸淫就存于恶欲中。这就是“爬物”，也就是起源于我欲和物欲，即自我中心的乐趣所固有的快乐的性质。它们就是人们的偶像，因为人们视它们为快乐，并热爱之，将其奉为神明，因而崇拜它们。在代表性教会中，这些爬物由于具有这种污秽的意义，因而同样是不洁净的，甚至不许摸它们，凡摸它们的，就是不洁的（如利未记<a href="http://39-27.cn/利5.2.htm">5:2</a>；<a href="http://39-27.cn/利11.31.htm">11:31</a>-<a href="http://39-27.cn/利11.33.htm">33</a>；<a href="http://39-27.cn/利22.5.htm">22:5</a>-<a href="http://39-27.cn/利22.6.htm">6</a>所看到的）。</p>

<p><strong>[NCE]994.</strong> Every creeping thing that is alive symbolizes any lower pleasure that contains some goodness, which is the living aspect. This can be seen from the symbolism of a creeping thing, discussed previously [<a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_994/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_44" target=_top>44</a>, <a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_994/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_594" target=_top>594</a>, <a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_994/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_674" target=_top>674</a>, <a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_994/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_746" target=_top>746</a>, <a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_994/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_800" target=_top>800</a>, <a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_994/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_807" target=_top>807</a>, <a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_994/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_909" target=_top>909-911</a>].<br />Anyone can see that the creeping things mean all clean animals and birds, because it says that they were supplied as food. Strictly speaking, creeping things are those that were the most contemptible of all (listed in <a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_994/bible_king-james-version_leviticus_11_23" target=_top>Leviticus 11:23</a>, <a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_994/bible_king-james-version_leviticus_11_29-30" target=_top>29-30</a>) and unclean. In a wider sense, though — the sense used here — they are animals supplied as food. They are being called creeping things because creeping things symbolize lower pleasures. In the Word, clean animals symbolize our more tender emotional responses, as noted [<a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_994/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_45" target=_top>45</a>, <a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_994/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_46" target=_top>46</a>, <a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_994/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_142" target=_top>142</a>, <a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_994/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_143" target=_top>143</a>, <a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_994/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_246" target=_top>246</a>, <a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_994/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_776" target=_top>776</a>, <a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_994/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_987" target=_top>987</a>]; but since we are not aware of those responses except as revealed in our lower pleasures (so much so that we actually refer to them as pleasures), they are called creeping things here.<br />[2] There are two kinds of lower pleasures: those that involve the will and those that involve the intellect. These are the general types of pleasure: pleasure in owning property and having other wealth; the pleasure of rank and high office in government; pleasure connected with love in marriage and with love for babies and children; pleasure in friendship and social contact; the pleasure of reading, writing, learning, and growing in wisdom. And there are many others.<br />There are also pleasures of the senses. For instance there is auditory pleasure, which in general is pleasure in the sweetness of song and music; visual pleasure, which in general is pleasure in many different kinds of beauty; olfactory pleasure, which is pleasure in sweet scents; gustatory pleasure, which is pleasure in the wonderful flavor and useful qualities of food and drink; and tactile pleasure, which is pleasure in a variety of agreeable sensations.<br />These general kinds of gratification are felt in the body and so are called bodily pleasures, but the body never experiences any kind of pleasure unless the pleasure springs from some deeper emotion that also sustains it. And no deeper emotion ever exists unless it comes from one still deeper that holds within it a use and purpose.<br />[3] These layers of emotion that go deeper and deeper, all the way to our inmost reaches, are not something we sense while we are living in the body. Most people hardly even realize that they exist, let alone that the lower pleasures stem from them. In reality, though, nothing can emerge on the surface if it does not come from progressively deeper sources. Sensual gratification is only an outward effect. As long as we live in the body we cannot see what lies within, unless we reflect on it.<br />Deeper elements first reveal themselves in the next life, and they do so sequentially as the Lord lifts us up toward heaven. Inner emotions, with their satisfactions, reveal themselves in the world of spirits. Emotions yet deeper, with their delights, appear in the heaven of angelic spirits. And emotions yet deeper again, with their blessings, reveal themselves in the heaven of angels. (There are, indeed, three heavens, each deeper, more perfect, and more blessed than the last, as may be seen in <a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_994/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_459" target=_top>459</a> and <a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_994/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_684" target=_top>684</a>.)<br />These things unfold in order this way and disclose themselves to our awareness in the other world. But while we live in the body, since our whole focus and concentration is on bodily concerns, deeper elements are essentially put to sleep, being overwhelmed by those concerns. Still, the thoughtful individual can see that our pleasures all reflect the layered depths of our emotional responses and derive their whole existence and character from them.<br />[4] The progressively deeper layers of emotion are called creeping things because we experience them as pleasures that lie on the surface, in our body. But this is only a physical manifestation, the effect of inner processes, as anyone can see merely from the power of sight and the pleasures that accompany it. Unless there is an inner power of sight, the eye cannot possibly see. The vision of the eye arises from inner vision,{*1} for which reason we can still see just as well after the body's death as when we were alive in the body, and much better. We simply do not see what is worldly and material but rather what belongs to the other life. People who had been blind in physical life see as clearly in the next life as those who had been veritable Lynceuses.{*2} For the same reason, when we are asleep we see as well in our dreams as when we are awake. By means of inner sight, I have been allowed to see the objects of the next life more clearly than I can see the objects of the world.<br />These considerations establish the fact that outer sight arises from inner sight, and this from sight still deeper, and so on. Likewise with each of the other senses, and with all the lower pleasures.<br />[5] Other places in the Word as well call the lower pleasures creeping things, and those places also differentiate between clean and unclean ones — that is, between pleasures enjoyed in a living or heavenly way and pleasures enjoyed in a dead or hellish way. In Hosea, for example:<br />I will strike a pact with them on that day — with the wild animal of the field, and with the bird in the heavens and the creeping thing of the ground. (<a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_994/bible_king-james-version_hosea_2_18" target=_top>Hosea 2:18</a>)<br />This passage demonstrates that the wild animal of the field, the bird in the heavens, and creeping things symbolize the kinds of things in us that I have already mentioned, since it is talking about a new church. In David:<br />Let the heavens and the earth, the seas and every creeping thing in them praise Jehovah. (<a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_994/bible_king-james-version_psalms_69_34" target=_top>Psalms 69:34</a>)<br />The seas and the creeping things in them cannot praise Jehovah, only the living, human attributes they symbolize. That is to say, he can be praised only from the living quality of those attributes. In the same author:<br />Praise Jehovah, you wild animal and each of you beasts, you creeping thing and bird on the wing. (<a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_994/bible_king-james-version_psalms_148_1-14" target=_top>Psalms 148</a>: [7,] 10)<br />The same is true here.<br />The fact that these passages use creeping things to mean positive emotions from which gratifications stem can also be seen from the consideration that creeping things were unclean to the people of that time. This will become evident from the following quotations.<br />[6] In the same author:<br />Jehovah, the earth is full of your possessions. This sea is large, and wide in its extent. In it is the creeping thing, and there is no counting them. They all look to you to give them their food in its season. You give to them; they gather. You open your hand; they receive abundant good. (<a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_994/bible_king-james-version_psalms_104_24-25" target=_top>Psalms 104:24-25</a>, <a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_994/bible_king-james-version_psalms_104_27-28" target=_top>27-28</a>)<br />In the inner meaning, the seas symbolize spiritual entities, while the creeping things symbolize everything that receives its life from them. Giving them food in its season and receiving abundant good depict the enjoyment [of pleasure]. In Ezekiel:<br />And it will happen that every living soul that crawls in any place where the rivers go will survive; and the fish will be very numerous, because that water goes there and is cured, and everything will live, wherever the river goes. (<a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_994/bible_king-james-version_ezekiel_47_9" target=_top>Ezekiel 47:9</a>)<br />This is about water flowing from a new Jerusalem. Water stands for spiritual traits from a heavenly origin. The living soul that crawls stands for positive desires and the gratifications they give rise to, both those that are personal and those that are sensory. The fact that these receive life from the water — from spiritual traits of heavenly origin — is obvious.<br />[7] Tainted pleasures, which trace their origin to self-absorption and so to the sordid cravings of self-absorption, are also called creeping things, as can be seen in Ezekiel:<br />And I went in and looked, and here, every shape of creeping thing and animal (an abhorrence) and all the idols of the house of Israel — a painting on the wall all around. (<a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_994/bible_king-james-version_ezekiel_8_10" target=_top>Ezekiel 8:10</a>)<br />The shape of a creeping thing symbolizes foul pleasures, within which lie corrupt desires, within which again lie hatred, vengeance, cruelty, and adultery. Such urges are creeping things, or the thrill of a lower pleasure springing from love for ourselves and for worldly advantages, which is to say, from self-absorption. These are the idols of the self-absorbed, because these are the things they consider agreeable, love, view as gods, and therefore venerate. Because these creeping things symbolized such vile attributes, the representative church{*3} deemed them so unclean that it was not permissible even to touch them, and anyone who did so much as touch them was unclean, as shown by <a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_994/bible_king-james-version_leviticus_5_2" target=_top>Leviticus 5:2</a>; <a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_994/bible_king-james-version_leviticus_11_31-32" target=_top>11:31-32</a>, <a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_994/bible_king-james-version_leviticus_11_33" target=_top>33</a>; <a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_994/bible_king-james-version_leviticus_22_5-6" target=_top>22:5-6</a>.<br /><br /><strong>Footnotes:</strong><br />{*1} For more on inner vision, see <a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_994/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_1954" target=_top>1954</a>.

Every creeping thing that liveth. That this signifies all pleasures in which there is good which is living, is evident from the signification of a "creeping thing" as shown before. That creeping things 
here mean all clean beasts and birds, is evident to everyone, for it is said that they are given for food. Creeping things in their proper sense are such as are vilest of all (as named in Lev. 11:23, 
29, 30), and were unclean. But in a broad sense, as here, animals are meant which are given for food; yet here they are called "creeping things" because they signify pleasures. Man's affections are 
signified in the Word by clean beasts, as already said; but since his affections are perceived only in his pleasures, so that he calls them pleasures, they are here called "creeping things."  [2] Pleasures 
are of two kinds, those of the will, and those of the understanding. In general there are the pleasures of possession of land and wealth, the pleasures of honor and office in the state, the pleasures 
of conjugial love and of love for infants and children, the pleasures of friendship and of converse with companions, the pleasures of reading, of writing, of knowing, of being wise; and many others. 
There are also the pleasures of the senses: as the pleasure of hearing, which is in general that from the sweetness of music and song; and that of seeing, which is in general that of various and 
manifold beauties; and of smelling, which is from the sweetness of odors; and of tasting, which is from the agreeableness and wholesomeness of foods and drinks; and of touch, from many pleasing sensations. 
These kinds of pleasures, being felt in the body, are called pleasures of the body. But no pleasure ever exists in the body unless it exists and subsists from an interior affection, and no interior 
affection exists except from one more interior, in which is the use and the end.  [3] These things which, in regular order, are interior, commencing from those which are inmost, are not perceived 
by man while he lives in the body, and most men hardly know that they exist, still less that they are the source of pleasures; when yet nothing can ever exist in externals except from things interior 
in order. Pleasures are only ultimate effects. The interior things do not lie open to view so long as men live in the body, except to those who reflect upon them. In the other life they for the first 
time come forth to view, and indeed in the order in which they are elevated by the Lord toward heaven. Interior affections with their delights manifest themselves in the world of spirits, the more 
interior with their delights in the heaven of angelic spirits, and the still more interior with their happiness in the heaven of angels; for there are three heavens, one more interior, more perfect, and 
more happy than another (see n. 459, 684). These interiors unfold and present themselves to perception in the other life; but so long as man lives in the body, since he is all the time in the idea 
and thought of corporeal things, these interior things are as it were asleep, being immersed in the corporeal things. But yet it may be evident to anyone who reflects, that all pleasures are such as are 
the affections that are more and more interior in order, and that they receive from these all their essence and quality.  [4] Since the affections that are more and more interior in order are felt 
in the extremes or outermost things, that is, in the body, as pleasures, they are called "creeping things" but they are only corporeal things affected by internal ones, as must be evident to everyone 
merely from sight and its pleasures. Except there be interior sight, no eye can ever see. The sight of the eye exists from interior sight, and for this reason after the death of the body man sees equally 
as well and even better than when he lived in the body-not indeed worldly and corporeal things, but those of the other life. Those who were blind in the life of the body, see in the other life as 
well as those who had keen vision. So too when man sleeps, he sees in his dreams as clearly as when awake. It has been given me to see by internal sight the things in the other life more clearly than 
I see the things in the world. From all this it is evident that external sight comes forth from interior sight, and this from sight still more interior, and so on. It is similar with every other sense 
and with every pleasure.  [5] Pleasures are likewise in other parts of the Word called "creeping things" with a distinction between the clean and the unclean, that is, between pleasures the delights 
of which are living, or heavenly, and pleasures the delights of which are dead or infernal. As in Hosea: </p>
<p>     In that day will I make a covenant for them with the wild animal of the field, and with 
the fowl of the heavens, and with the creeping thing of the ground (Hos. 2:18). That here the wild animal of the field, the fowl of the heavens, and the creeping thing, signify such things in man as 
have been said, is evident from the subject being a new church. In David: </p>
<p>     Let the heavens and the earth praise Jehovah, the seas, and everything that creepeth therein (Ps. 69:34). The seas and 
the things that creep therein cannot praise Jehovah, but the things in man that are signified by them and are living, thus from what is living within them. Again: </p>
<p>     Praise Jehovah ye wild animal 
and every beast, creeping thing and winged fowl (Ps. 148:10), with a similar meaning.  [6] That here by "creeping thing" nothing else is meant than good affections from which are pleasures, is evident 
also from creeping things being with this people unclean, as will be plain from what follows. Again: </p>
<p>     O Jehovah the earth is full of Thy riches; this sea, great and wide, wherein are things creeping 
without number; these wait all upon Thee, that Thou mayest give them their food in due season; Thou givest them, they gather; Thou openest Thy hand, they are satiated with good (Ps. 104:24-28). Here 
in the internal sense by "seas" are signified spiritual things, by "things creeping" all things that live therefrom; the enjoyment is signified by giving them food in due season, and by their being 
satiated with good. In Ezekiel: </p>
<p>     And it shall come to pass that every living soul that creepeth, in every place whither the rivers come, shall live; and there shall be a very great multitude 
of fish, because these waters are come thither, and they shall be healed, and everything shall live whithersoever the river cometh (Ezek. 47:9). Here are meant the waters of the New Jerusalem; these 
waters denote spiritual things from a celestial origin; "the living soul that creepeth" the affections of good, and the pleasures therefrom, both of the body and of the senses; that these live from the 
"waters" or from spiritual things from a celestial origin, is very evident.  [7] That filthy pleasures too, which have their origin in what is man's own, thus in the foul cupidities thereof, are also 
called "creeping things" is evident in Ezekiel: </p>
<p>     So I went in and saw; and behold every form of creeping thing and of beast, the abomination, and all the idols of the house of Israel, portrayed 
upon the wall round about (Ezek. 8:10). Here the "form of creeping thing" signifies unclean pleasures whose interiors are cupidities, and the interiors of these, hatreds, revenges, cruelties, and 
adulteries; such are the "creeping things" or delights of pleasures from the love of self and of the world, or from man's Own, which are their "idols" because they regard them as delightful, love them, 
have them for gods, and thus adore them. In the representative church, these creeping things, because they had such a vile signification, were likewise so unclean that it was not permitted even to touch 
them; and he who but touched them was unclean (as may be seen in Lev. 5:2; 11:31-33; 22:5-6). </p>

<p align="center"><b>Elliott(1983-1999) 994</b></p><p><b>994.</b>
That 'every creeping thing that is living' means all pleasures containing good, which is living, is clear from the meaning of 'creeping thing' dealt with already. The fact that 'creeping thing' here 
means all clean beasts and birds is clear to everyone, for it is said that they are 'given for food'. In their proper sense 'creeping things' comprise those which were the basest of all, mentioned by 
name in <a href="http://bible.gospelcom.net/cgi-bin/bible?passage=Lev%2011:27,%2029,%2030&amp;version=ESV&amp;interface=print&amp;showfn=yes&amp;showxref">Lev 11:27, 29, 30</a>, and were unclean. But in a broad sense, as here, they are the living creatures that have been given for food. They are called 'creeping things' here however because they mean 
pleasures. In the Word, human affections are meant by 'clean beasts', as has been s rated. But because no one perceives those affections except within his pleasures, so much so that he refers to them 
as pleasures, they are for this reason called 'creeping things' here.  </p>
<p></p>
<p><b>[2]</b>
 There are two kinds of pleasures - those of the will and those of the understanding In general there are the pleasures 
of possessing land and wealth; the pleasures of positions of honour and those of service to the state; the pleasures of conjugial love, and of love of infants and children; the pleasures of friendship 
and of social intercourse; the pleasures of reading, writing, having knowledge, being wise, and many others. Then there are the pleasures of the senses; such as that of hearing, which in general is the 
pleasure taken in the sweet sounds of music and song; that of seeing, which in general is the pleasure taken in various things of beauty, which are manifold; that of smell, which is that taken in pleasant 
odours; that of taste, which is that taken in all the delicious and nourishing qualities of food and drink; and that of touch, which arises from further joyous sensations. Because these different 
kinds of pleasures are experienced in the body, they are called pleasures of the body. But no pleasure ever arises in the body unless it arises from, and is sustained by, some interior affection. 
Nor does any interior affection ever do so unless this in turn stems from a still more interior affection in which use and the end in view reside.  </p>
<p></p>
<p><b>[3]</b>
 These areas of affection, which are interior 
and properly ordered, starting with the inmost, are not discerned by anyone during his lifetime. The majority scarcely know that they even exist, let alone that they are the source of pleasures. Yet nothing 
can possibly arise in things that are external except from those that are interior and in order. Pleasures are simply ultimate effects. Interior things are not evident during life in the body except 
to those who reflect. It is in the next life that they first manifest themselves, and indeed in the order in which the Lord raises them up towards heaven. Interior affections together with their 
joys manifest themselves in the world of spirits; still more interior ones together with their delights do so in the heaven of angelic spirits; and yet more interior ones together with all their happiness 
in the heaven of angels. For there are three heavens, one interior to and more perfect and happy than the next, see <a href="459.htm">459</a> and <a href="684.htm">684</a>. Such is the order in which these things unfold and enable themselves 
to be perceived in the next life. But so long as someone is living in the body, because his ideas and thought are constantly of bodily things, those that are interior are so to speak dormant because 
they are immersed in bodily things. All the same, to anyone who stops to reflect it becomes clear that the nature of all pleasures is such as are the affections ranged in order within them and that 
those pleasures derive their entire essence and character from those affections. </p>
<p></p>
<p><b>[4]</b>
 Since the affections ranged in order within are experienced in outermost things, that is, in the body, as pleasures, 
they are therefore called 'creeping things'. But these are simply bodily feelings that are the products of things within, as may become clear to anyone merely from sight and its pleasures. If interior 
sight does not exist, the eye cannot possibly see. The sight of the eye comes from a more interior sight, and therefore also man has the gift of sight just as much after his life in the body as 
during it; indeed he sees far better than when he lived in the body, though now he does not see worldly and bodily things but things that exist in the next life. People who have been blind during their 
lifetime have the gift of sight in the next life just as much as those who have been sharp-sighted. This also is why when someone is asleep he sees in his dreams just as clearly as when awake. With 
my internal sight I have been allowed to see the things that exist in the next life more clearly than I see those which exist in the world. From these considerations it is clear that external sight comes 
from a more interior sight, which in turn comes from sight still more interior, and so on. The same applies to each one of the other senses and to every kind of pleasure.  </p>
<p></p>
<p><b>[5]</b>
 In other parts of 
the Word pleasures are in a similar way called 'creeping things'. In those places too a distinction is made between creeping things that are clean and those that are not, that is, between pleasures 
whose joys are living or heavenly, and pleasures whose joys are dead or hellish, as in Hosea, </p>
<blockquote>
I will make for them a covenant on that day with the wild animals of the field, and with the birds of the 
air,<A name="fntext1"></a><A href="#fn1"><sup>a</sup></a> and with the creeping things of the ground. <a href="http://bible.gospelcom.net/cgi-bin/bible?passage=Hosea%202:18&amp;version=ESV&amp;interface=print&amp;showfn=yes&amp;showxref">Hosea 2:18</a>. 
</blockquote>
<p>Here 'wild animals of the field, birds of the air,<A name="fntext1"></a><A href="#fn1"><sup>a</sup></a> and creeping things' means the kind of things already mentioned that reside with 
man. This becomes clear for the reason that a new Church is the subject. In David, </p>
<blockquote>
Let heaven and earth praise Jehovah, the seas and everything creeping in them. <a href="http://bible.gospelcom.net/cgi-bin/bible?passage=Ps%2069:34&amp;version=ESV&amp;interface=print&amp;showfn=yes&amp;showxref">Ps 69:34</a>. 
</blockquote>
<p>'Seas and creeping things 
in them' cannot praise Jehovah but the things with man which they mean and which are alive, and so from what is living within them. In the same author,  </p>
<blockquote>
Praise Jehovah, wild animal and every 
beast, creeping thing and winged bird. <a href="http://bible.gospelcom.net/cgi-bin/bible?passage=Ps%20148:10&amp;version=ESV&amp;interface=print&amp;showfn=yes&amp;showxref">Ps 148:10</a>. 
</blockquote>
<p>Here the meaning is similar. That 'creeping things' is used here to mean nothing other than good affections in which pleasures originate is clear 
also from the fact that creeping things among them were unclean, as will be evident from the following: </p>
<p> </p>
<p><b>[6]</b>
 In the same author, </p>
<blockquote>
O Jehovah, the earth is full of Your possessions; this sea, great 
and wide, containing creeping things and innumerable; they all look to You to give them their food in due season. You givest to them - they gather it up; You openest Your hand - they are satisfied with 
good. <a href="http://bible.gospelcom.net/cgi-bin/bible?passage=Ps%20104:24,%2015,%2027,%2028&amp;version=ESV&amp;interface=print&amp;showfn=yes&amp;showxref">Ps 104:24, 15, 27, 28</a>. 
</blockquote>
<p>Here in the internal sense 'seas' means spiritual things, 'creeping things' all things that live from them. Fruitfulness is described by 'giving them food in due season 
and being satisfied with good'. In Ezekiel,  </p>
<blockquote>
It will be that every living creature<A name="fntext2"></a><A href="#fn2"><sup>b</sup></a> that creeps, in every place the [two] rivers come to, will live, and there will be very many fish, for these 
waters go there, and become fresh, and everything will live where the river goes. <a href="http://bible.gospelcom.net/cgi-bin/bible?passage=Ezek%2047:9&amp;version=ESV&amp;interface=print&amp;showfn=yes&amp;showxref">Ezek 47:9</a>. 
</blockquote>
<p>This refers to the waters flowing out of the New Jerusalem. 'Waters' stands for spiritual things from 
a celestial origin. 'Living creature that creeps' stands for affections for good and the pleasures deriving from these affections, both those of the body and those of the senses. The fact that the latter 
get their life from 'the waters' which are spiritual things from a celestial origin is quite clear.  </p>
<p></p>
<p><b>[7]</b>
 Filthy pleasures as well, which have their origin in the proprium and so in its foul desires, 
are also called 'creeping things'. This is clear in Ezekiel,  </p>
<blockquote>
And I went and saw, and behold, every form of creeping thing and of beast, an abomination; and all the idols of the house of Israel, 
portrayed on the wall round about. <a href="http://bible.gospelcom.net/cgi-bin/bible?passage=Ezek%208:10&amp;version=ESV&amp;interface=print&amp;showfn=yes&amp;showxref">Ezek 8:10</a>. 
</blockquote>
<p>Here 'the form of a creeping thing' means filthy pleasures in which evil desires exist interiorly, and hatred, revenge, cruelty, and adultery within 
these. Such is the nature of 'creeping things', that is, the delights inherent in pleasures which originate in self-love and love of the world, that is, in the proprium. They are people's idols because 
they consider them delightful, love them, hold them as gods, and in so doing worship them. Because those creeping things meant filthy things such as these, in the representative Church also they 
were so unclean that no one was even allowed to touch them. And anyone who did merely touch them was rendered unclean, as is clear from <a href="http://bible.gospelcom.net/cgi-bin/bible?passage=Lev%205:2;%2011:31-33;%2022:5,%206&amp;version=ESV&amp;interface=print&amp;showfn=yes&amp;showxref">Lev 5:2; 11:31-33; 22:5, 6</a>.

'Omne reptile quod est vivum': quod significet omnes voluptates in quibus bonum, quod est 'vivum,' constat a significatione 'reptilis,' de qua prius: quod reptilia hic significent omnes bestias et aves 
mundas, constat unicuivis, nam dicitur quod data sint in cibum; reptilia in proprio sensu sunt quae omnium vilissima fuerunt quae nominantur Lev. xi 23, 29, 30, et fuerunt immunda; at in lato sensu, 
ut hic, sunt animalia quae in cibum data sunt; sed hic vocantur 'reptilia' quia significant voluptates; affectiones hominis significantur in Verbo per 'bestias mundas,' ut dictum; sed quia non percipiuntur 
quam in ejus voluptatibus, adeo ut homo nominet eas voluptates, ideo 'reptilia' hic vocantur.  [2] Duplicis generis voluptates sunt, nempe  voluntariorum et intellectualium; in genere sunt voluptates 
possessionum terrae, et opum; voluptates honorum, et officiorum in republica; voluptates amoris conjugialis, et amoris erga infantes et liberos; voluptates amicitiae, et conversationis cum sociis; 
voluptates legendi, scribendi, sciendi, sapiendi, et plures aliae; sunt etiam voluptates sensuum; ut auditus, in genere voluptas suavitatis cantus et musicae; visus, in genere est voluptas pulchritudinum 
diversarum, quae multiplices sunt; olfactus, est suavitatum odoris; gustus, est dulcedinum, et utilitatum ex cibis et potulentis; tactus, sunt amoenitatum plurium: haec genera voluptatum quia 
sentiantur in corpore, vocantur corporis; sed nusquam aliqua voluptas in corpore existit nisi existat et subsistat ex quadam affectione interiore; et nusquam aliqua affectio interior, nisi ab affectione 
adhuc interiore in qua est usus et finis; [3] haec quae ordine interiora sunt usque ab intimis, homo dum in corpore vivit, non sentit, et plerique vix norunt quod sint, minus quod voluptates sint 
inde; cum tamen in externis nusquam aliquid existere potest nisi ab interioribus ordine; sunt voluptates modo effectus ultimi; interiora non patent quamdiu vivunt in corpore nisi eis qui reflectunt; 
in altera vita se primum manifestant, et quidem ordine quo versus caelum a Domino elevantur; affectiones interiores cum suis jucundis se manifestant in mundo spirituum; adhuc interiores cum suis amoenis 
in caelo spirituum angelicorum; et adhuc interiores cum suis felicibus in caelo angelorum; nam tres caeli sunt, unum interius, perfectius et felicius altero; videatur n. 459 et 684; haec ita se ordine 
evolvunt et se sistunt percipienda in altera vita; sed quamdiu homo in corpore vivit, qUia continue in idea et cogitatione corporeorum est, interiora illa quasi sopita sunt quia immersa corporeis; 
sed usque reflectenti constare potest quod voluptates omnes tales sint quales affectiones ordine interiores, et quod ab iis omnem suam essentiam et qualitatem accipiant.  [4] Quia affectiones ordine 
interiores sentiuntur in extremis, seu in corpore, ut voluptates, ideo vocantur 'reptilia'; sed sunt modo corporea, quae afficiuntur ab internis, sicut unicuivis constare potest solum ex visu et ejus 
voluptatibus; nisi interior visus sit, nusquam potest oculus videre; visus oculi existit a visu interiore, quare etiam homo post vitam corporis aeque videt, et melius multo quam cum vixit in corpore, 
verum non mundana et corporea, sed illa quae in altera vita; qui caeci fuerunt in vita corporis aeque ac qui lyncei fuerunt, in altera vita vident; quare etiam cum dormit homo, in somniis suis aeque videt 
sicut dum vigil; visu interno datum est mihi videre illa quae in altera vita, clarius quam video ea quae in mundo: ex quibus constat quod visus externus existat a visu interiore; et hic a visu adhuc 
interiore, et sic porro: similiter se habet cum omni alio sensu, et cum omni voluptate.  [5] Voluptates similiter alibi in Verbo vocantur reptilia, et ibi distinguitur quoque inter reptilia munda 
et immunda, hoc est, inter voluptates quarum jucunda sunt viva seu caelestia, et inter voluptates quarum jucunda sunt mortua seu infernalia; ut apud Hosheam, 	Pangam illis foedus in die illo, cum fera 
agri et cum avi caelorum, et reptili humi, ii 18; </p>
<p>ubi quod 'fera agri, avis caelorum et reptilia' significent talia quae dicta, apud hominem, constare potest quia de Ecclesia nova agitur: apud Davidem, 	Laudent 
Jehovam caeli et terra, maria et omne repens in iis, Ps. lxix 35 [A.V. 34]; </p>
<p>'maria et repentia in iis' non laudare possunt Jehovam sed quae per illa significantur apud hominem quae viva 
sunt, ita ex vivis quae in illis; apud eundem, 	Laudate Jehovam fera et omnis bestia, reptile et avis{1} alae, Ps. cxlviii 10; </p>
<p>similiter. Quod per 'reptilia' hic non alia intelligantur quam bonae 
affectiones a quibus voluptates, constat quoque inde quia reptilia apud eos erant immunda, ut a sequentibus patebit: [6] apud eundem, 	Jehovah plena est terra possessionibus tuis; hoc mare magnum, et 
latum spatiis; ibi reptile et non numerus;... omnia Te spectant{2}, ut des cibum eorum in tempore suo; das illis, colligunt; aperis manum Tuam, saturantur bono, Ps. civ 24, 25, 27, 28; </p>
<p>ubi in sensu 
interno per 'maria' significantur spiritualia; per 'reptilia,' omnia quae inde vivunt; fruitio describitur per 'dare iis cibum in tempore suo, et saturari bono:' apud Ezechielem, 	Et erit, omnis anima 
viva quae reptat, ad omne quo venit{3} fluvii, vivet, et erit piscis multus valde, quia 	veniunt eo aquae hae, et sanantur, et vivet omne quo venit fluvius, xlvii 9; </p>
<p>ubi de aquis ex nova Hierosolyma; 
'aquae' pro spiritualibus ex origine caelesti; 'anima viva quae reptat' pro affectionibus boni et voluptatibus inde, tam corporis quam sensualium; quae quod 'vivant ex aquis,' seu spiritualibus ab 
origine caelesti, manifeste constat.  [7] Quod etiam voluptates spurcae quae originem trahunt a proprio, ita a foedis ejus cupiditatibus, quoque 'reptilia' dicantur, constat apud Ezechielem, 	Et ingressus 
et vidi, et ecce omnis forma reptilis et bestiae, abominatio; et omnia idola domus Israelis, depictum{4} super pariete circum circa, viii 10; </p>
<p>ubi 'forma reptilis' significat spurcas voluptates 
quarum interiora sunt cupiditates, et harum, odia, vindictae, crudelitates et adulteria; talia sunt 'reptilia' seu jucunda voluptatum, ex amore sui et mundi seu proprio, quae sunt idola eorum quia ea 
jucunda putant, amant, pro diis habent et sic adorant: quae reptilia quia significabant talia foeda, in Ecclesia repraesentativa etiam ita immunda fuerunt ut ne quidem ea tangere liceret, et qui solum 
tetigit, erat immundus, ut constat, Lev. v 2; xi 31-33; xxii 5, 6. 	@1 See note to 776.$ 	@2 T. changes to expectant, but Heb. [ ] (sabar) = 'to view, look for,' though its Piel form here ='to hope.'$$ 	@3
