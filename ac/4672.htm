<h3 align="center" class="ired">属天的奥秘 第4672节</h3>
<h4 align="center"></h4><p><strong>4672.</strong>“他是个少年”表起初。这从“少年”的含义清楚可知，当论及教会时，“少年”是指起初，或教会的最初状态。事实上，教会就像一个婴孩、少年、成年人，以及最终的老人，因为它像一个人那样经历它的各个年龄阶段或生命阶段。教会总体上也像一个人，并被如此称呼。此外，在由于所在的阶段而被称为“少年”，并因本性而很快变得任性、远离的教会中，主起初既与那些教导人的人同在，也与那些学习的人同在。但过了一阵子，他们就与主断绝关系，这一点由约瑟被他的兄弟们推入坑中，然后被卖掉来代表。<br />始于信的每个教会都是这样子，但始于仁的教会截然不同。始于信的教会唯独受理解力掌控，理解力无非是人里面的遗传之物，也就是自我之爱和尘世之爱。这些爱劝诱理解力从圣言搜集材料支持它们的欲望，并对不支持的材料给予自己的解释。而始于仁的教会就不同了。这种教会受良善掌控，而主就在这良善里面。因为良善，也就是仁与爱的良善，是主与信之间的媒介；若没有这个媒介，属灵的交流是不可能的。没有一个居间物，祂绝无可能流入信。如果邪恶取代了良善，它就会赶走主，并要么弃绝、要么败坏主的一切事物、因而信的全部；因为信通过良善来自主。</p>

And he was a boy. That this signifies at first, is evident from the signification of a "boy," when predicated of a new church, as being what is at first, or its first state; for the church is as an infant, 
a boy, a man, and at last an old man, for it passes through its several ages like a man. The church also in general is like a man, and is so called. Moreover, in the church which from its age is 
called a "boy," and is such as quickly to turn away, the Lord is at first present, both with those who teach and with those who learn; but afterwards He is sent away by them, as is represented by Joseph's 
being cast by his brethren into a pit and sold. [2] Such is every church which begins from faith, but very different is the church which begins from charity. The church which begins from faith 
has nothing to direct it but the understanding, and the understanding nothing but what is hereditary in man, that is to say, the love of self and of the world. These persuade the understanding to search 
for things from the Word that will confirm them, and to explain away what is not confirmatory. It is otherwise with the church which begins from charity: good is its director, and in good the Lord; 
for between the Lord and faith there intervenes the good of charity and of love, and without this intervention there can be no spiritual communication, for there is no influx without an intermediate. 
If evil is in the place of good, it drives away the Lord, and either rejects or perverts all things that are of Him, thus all that are of faith, for faith is from Him through good. </p>

<p align="center"><b>Elliott(1983-1999) 4672</b></p><p><b>4672.</b>
'And he, still a boy' means at first. This is clear from the meaning of 'a boy' - when this expression is used to refer to a new Church - as at first, that is, as the first state of that Church. For 
the Church is like an infant, a boy, a man, and at length an old man, in that it passes as the individual does through its own phases of life. The Church also resembles the human being in general, and 
is actually called one. Furthermore, within the Church which is called 'a boy' because of the phase it is at, and which is by nature such that it soon becomes wayward, the Lord is present at first, both 
with those who teach and those who learn. But after a while they dissociate themselves from Him, as is also represented by the brothers throwing Joseph into the pit and selling him. </p>
<p></p>
<p><b>[2]</b>
 Every Church 
which begins with faith is like this, but a Church beginning with charity is different. A Church that begins with faith is controlled solely by the understanding, and the understanding by that which 
has been inherited, namely self-love and love of the world. These loves induce the understanding to gather texts from the Word which support their desires, and to give its own interpretation to those 
which do not support them. It is different in the case of a Church which begins with charity. This Church is controlled by good, the Lord being within that good. For good which is the good of charity 
and love is a mediator between the Lord and faith; and unless it is there as a mediator between them no spiritual communication is possible. Without that intermediary He cannot possibly flow into 
faith. If evil exists there instead of good it drives away the Lord and casts aside or else perverts everything that is the Lord's and so the whole of faith; for faith comes from Him through good. </p>

</p><b>4672.</b>
`Et is puer': quod significet primum, constat ex significatione `pueri' cum praedicatur de nova Ecclesia, quod sit primum seu primus ejus status; Ecclesia enim se habet sicut infans, sicut puer, 
sicut vir, et tandem sicut senex, nam percurrit illa suas aetates sicut homo; est quoque (o)Ecclesia sicut homo in communi, et quoque ita vocatur.  In Ecclesia etiam quae ex aetate `puer' dicitur et 
quae talis est ut cito deflectat, Dominus primum est praesens, et cum illis qui docent et qui discunt, sed postea ab illis abalienatur, quod etiam repraesentatur per Josephum quod a fratribus missus 
in foveam et venditus.  [2] Omnis Ecclesia talis est quae incohat a fide, aliter vero Ecclesia quae incohat a charitate; quae a fide, nullum alium regulatorem habet quam intellectum, et intellectus 
id quod est hereditarium hominis, nempe amorem sui et mundi; hi persuadent intellectui ut conquirat confirmantia ex Verbo, et quae non confirmant ut interpretetur; </p>
<p>aliter Ecclesia quae a charitate 
incohat; ea regulatorem habet bonum, et in bono Dominum; inter Dominum enim et fidem intercedit bonum quod est charitatis et amoris; absque hoc intercedente non datur communicatio spiritualis; 
influxus absque intermedio non fit; </p>
<p>malum si loco boni est, abigit Dominum ac rejicit aut pervertit omnia quae Domini sunt, ita omnia quae fidei, nam fides est ab Ipso per bonum. </p>
