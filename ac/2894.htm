<h3 align="center" class="ired">属天的奥秘 第2894节</h3>
<h4 align="center"></h4><p>【标】序言</h4><br />2894.我们在约翰福音中读到：<br />太初有道，道与神同在，神就是道。这道太初与神同在。万物都是藉着祂造的，凡被造的，没有一样不是藉着祂造的。生命在祂里头，这生命就是人的光。光照在黑暗里，黑暗却不领受光。道成了肉身，住在我们里面，我们也见过祂的荣光，正是父独生子的荣光，充充满满地有恩典，有真理。（约翰福音<a href="http://39-27.cn/约1.1.htm">1:1</a>-<a href="http://39-27.cn/约1.5.htm">5</a>，<a href="http://39-27.cn/约1.14.htm">14</a>）<br />很少有人知道此处的“道”（即圣言）的真正意义是什么。从几个细节明显可知，“道”（即圣言）就是主；但内义教导：主的神性人才是“道”（即圣言）所表示的，因为经上说“道成了肉身，住在我们里面，我们也见过祂的荣光”。“道”（即圣言）因表神性人，故表凡涉及祂、源于祂的一切真理，这些真理就存在于主在天上的国度和在地上的教会中。因此，经上说“生命在祂里头，这生命就是人的光，光照在黑暗里”。“圣言或道”因表真理，故表一切启示，因而表圣言本身或圣经。</p>

PREFACE TO THE 23rd CHAPTER We read in John: </p>
<p>     In the beginning was the Word, and the Word was with God, and God was the Word. The same was in the beginning with God. All things were made by Him, 
and without Him was not anything made that was made. In Him was life, and the life was the light of men. And the light appeareth in the darkness, but the darkness comprehended it not. And the Word was 
made flesh and dwelt within us; and we beheld His glory, the glory as of the only-begotten of the Father, full of grace and truth (1:1-5, 14). Few know what is here meant by the "Word." That it is 
the Lord, is evident from the several particulars; but the internal sense teaches that it is the Lord as to His Divine Human that is meant by the "Word," for it is said: "the Word was made flesh and dwelt 
within us, and we beheld His glory." And because the Divine Human is meant by the "Word," all that Truth also is meant which relates to Him, and is from Him, in His kingdom in the heavens, and in 
His church on the earth. Hence it is said that "in Him was life, and the life was the light of men, and the light appeareth in the darkness." And because Truth is meant by the "Word," all revelation 
is meant, and thus also the Word itself or Holy Scripture. </p>

One reads in John, </p>
<blockquote>
In the beginning was the Word, and the Word was with God, and the Word was God. He was in the beginning with God. All things were made by Him, and without Him was not anything made 
that was made. In Him was life, and the life was the light of men. The light however appears in the darkness, but the darkness has not overcome it. And the Word became flesh and dwelt among us, and 
we beheld His glory, glory as of the Only Begotten from the Father, full of grace and truth. <a href="http://bible.gospelcom.net/cgi-bin/bible?passage=John%201:1-5,%2014&amp;version=ESV&amp;interface=print&amp;showfn=yes&amp;showxref">John 1:1-5, 14</a>. 
</blockquote>
<p>Few know what 'the Word' is really used to mean here. From every particular detail it 
is clear that the Lord is meant, but the internal sense teaches that it is the Lord as regards the Divine Human who is meant by 'the Word', for it is said that 'the Word became flesh and dwelt among us, 
and we beheld His glory'. And since the Divine Human is meant, 'the Word' is used to mean every truth having reference to Him and deriving from Him which exists in His kingdom in heaven and in His 
Church on earth. This is why it is said that 'in Him was life, and the life was the light of men, and the light appears in the darkness'. And since truth is meant, 'the Word' is used to mean all revelation, 
and thus also the Word itself or Holy Scripture. </p>

GENESEOS                CAPUT VIGESIMUM TERTIUM </p>
<p>Apud Johannem legitur,           In principio erat Verbum, et Verbum erat apud Deum, et      Deus erat Verbum.  Hoc erat in principio 
apud Deum.  Omnia       per Ipsum facta sunt, et sine Ipso factum est nihil, quod      factum est.  In Ipso vita erat, et vita erat lux hominum. Lux      autem in tenebris apparet, sed tenebrae 
illam non      comprehenderunt...Et Verbum caro factum est, et habitavit in      nobis, et vidimus gloriam Ipsius, gloriam ut Unigeniti a      Patre, plenus gratia et veritate, i 1-5, 14. Pauci sciunt 
quid hic per Verbum intelligitur; quod Dominus, ex singulis constat:  at sensus internus docet quod Dominus quoad Divinum Humanum per Verbum intelligatur, nam dicitur quod `Verbum caro factum, et 
habitavit in nobis, et vidimus gloriam Ipsius':  et quia Divinum Humanum, per Verbum intelligitur omne verum quod de Ipso et ex Ipso, in regno Ipsius in caelis, et in Ecclesia Ipsius in terris, inde 
dicitur quod `in Ipso vita erat, et vita erat lux hominum, et lux in tenebris apparet':  et quia verum, per Verbum intelligitur omnis revelatio, ita quoque ipsum Verbum seu Sancta Scriptura. </p>
