<h3 align="center" class="ired">属天的奥秘 第7686节</h3>
<h4 align="center"></h4><p><strong>7686.</strong>“以前没有这样的蝗虫，以后也必没有这样的”表自教会开始以来，从没有这样的虚假，将来也不会有这样的。这从“蝗虫”的含义清楚可知。“蝗虫”是指最外面部分中的虚假（参看<a href="7643.htm">7643</a>节）；以前没有这样的虚假，将来也不会有（参看<a href="7649.htm">7649</a>节）。不过，这一点需要解释一下。就内义而言，所论述的主题尤其是那些在主降临之前在低地，并且在主降世，披上人身，并使之成为神性之前无法被提入天堂的人（<a href="6854.htm">6854</a>，<a href="6914.htm">6914</a>节）。在此期间，他们被那些曾经也属于教会，信奉信之真理，然而却过着邪恶生活的恶人侵扰。那些在主降临之前曾属于教会，并过着邪恶生活的人沉浸在前所未有，以后也必没有的虚假之中。原因在于，那些被称为“拿非利人”，以及“亚纳人”和“利乏音人”，属于上古教会最后一代后裔的人尚未被关进地狱，而是四处游荡，在所到之处灌输可怕而致命的说服，因而也将它们灌输给教会里的恶人。这就是这种虚假的源头。至于这些“拿非利人”及其可怕的说服，可参看前文（<a href="310.htm">310</a>，<a href="560.htm">560</a>，<a href="562.htm">562</a>，<a href="563.htm">563</a>，<a href="570.htm">570</a>，<a href="581.htm">581</a>，<a href="585.htm">585</a>，<a href="607.htm">607</a>e，<a href="660.htm">660</a>，<a href="805.htm">805</a>，<a href="808.htm">808</a>，<a href="1034.htm">1034</a>，<a href="1120.htm">1120</a>，<a href="1265.htm">1265</a>-<a href="1272.htm">1272</a>，<a href="1673.htm">1673</a>节）。当主在世时，他们被主丢进一个地狱，这个地狱在左前方一段距离处。若不这样做，极少有人能得救，因为他们所灌输的虚假具有一种可怕的说服力，是致命的；像这样的虚假以前从来不曾有过，也永远不可能再有。那些在主降临之前侵扰属灵教会成员的人就沉浸于这种虚假。这就是此处这些话所表示的。他们具体是指那些侵扰者；不过，一般是指凡属于教会，在来世侵扰正直人的人，如今就有他们当中的很多人。</p>

Before it there was no such locust as this, and after it there shall not be such. That this signifies that such falsity has not been from the first time of the church, and shall not be, is evident from 
the signification of the "locust," as being falsity in the extremes (see n. 7643); (that such falsity has not been, nor shall be, see also above, n. 7649). How the case herein is, shall be told. In 
the internal sense those are specifically treated of who before the Lord's coming were in the lower earth, and could not be uplifted into heaven before the Lord came into the world, and assumed the Human, 
and made it Divine (n. 6854, 6914). Meanwhile they were infested by the evil, who also had been of the church, and had confessed the truths of faith, but had lived a life of evil. They who before 
the Lord's coming had been of the church and had been evil as to life, were in such falsity as had not been before, and shall not be afterward. The reason was that they who were called "Nephilim," also 
"Anakim" and "Rephaim," and were of the last posterity of the Most Ancient Church, were not yet shut up in hell, but wandered about and infused dire and deadly persuasions wherever they could, thus 
also into the evil in the church. This was the source of such falsity. (With respect to these "Nephilim," and their direful persuasions, see n. 310, 560, 562, 563, 570, 581, 585, 607, 660, 805, 808, 
1034, 1120, 1265-1272, 1673.) When the Lord was in the world, these were cast by Him into their hell, which is on the left in front at some distance. Unless this had been done, very few could have been 
saved, for the falsity which they infused had a direful persuasive power, and was deadly, such as never had been, and such as never can again be. With this falsity those had been imbued who before 
the Lord's coming infested those who were of the spiritual church. This is what is meant in the internal sense by the above words. These are they who are specifically treated of; but in general all are 
meant who are of the church and who infest the upright in the other life, of whom there are very many at this day. </p>

'Before them there were no [such] locusts like them, and there will not be such after them' means that no such falsity has existed since the Church first began, and such will not exist again. This is 
clear from the meaning of 'locusts' as falsity in outermost parts, dealt with in <a href="7643.htm">7643</a>; and the fact that no such falsity has existed or will exist, see also above in <a href="7649.htm">7649</a>. But this needs to be explained. 
The subject in the internal sense is in particular those who before the Lord's Coming were on the lower earth and could not be raised to heaven before the Lord had come into the world, taken on the 
Human, and made it Divine, see <a href="6854.htm">6854</a>, <a href="6914.htm">6914</a>. Till then they were molested by evil ones who also belonged to the Church and subscribed to the truths of faith, yet led an evil life. Those who before the 
Lord's Coming belonged to the Church and led an evil life were steeped in falsity, the like of which had not existed before then, nor ever will afterwards. The reason for this was that those called 
the Nephilim, also the Anakim and Rephaim, who belonged to the final descendants of the Most Ancient Church, had not yet been shut up in hell but wandered about, instilling dreadful and deadly persuasions 
wherever they could. They accordingly instilled them into evil people within the Church; and that was how such falsity came to exist with them. Regarding those Nephilim and their dreadful persuasions, 
see <a href="310.htm">310</a>, <a href="560.htm">560</a>, <a href="562.htm">562</a>, <a href="563.htm">563</a>, <a href="570.htm">570</a>, <a href="581.htm">581</a>, <a href="586.htm">586</a>, <a href="607.htm">607</a> (end), <a href="660.htm">660</a>, <a href="805.htm">805</a>, <a href="808.htm">808</a>, <a href="1034.htm">1034</a>, <a href="1120.htm">1120</a>, <a href="1265.htm">1265</a>-<a href="1272.htm">1272</a>, <a href="1673.htm">1673</a>. When the Lord was in the world He cast them into a hell some distance away out in front on the left. 
Had He not done so very few people could have been saved, for the falsity which was instilled by them carried with it a dreadful power of persuasion, and was lethal; the like of it had never existed 
before and cannot exist ever again. Steeped in that kind of falsity were those who before the Lord's Coming molested members of the spiritual Church. This is what the words at this point are used to mean 
in the internal sense. In particular they refer to those who were molesters then, but in general they refer to all who belong to the Church and molest the upright in the next life, of whom there are 
very many at the present day. </p>

`Ante illam non fuit [ita] locusta sicut illa, et post illam non ita erit': quod significet quod tale falsum non fuerit a primo tempore Ecclesiae, et quod non tale erit, constat ex significatione `locustae' 
quod sit falsum in extremis, de qua n. 7643; {1}quod tale falsum non fuerit, nec erit', videatur etiam supra n. 7649.  Quomodo hoc se habet, {2} dicendum: in interno sensu agitur in specie de 
illis qui ante Adventum Domini in terra inferiore fuerunt, {3}et non potuerunt in caelum elevari priusquam Dominus in mundum venit et assumpsit Humanum ac illud Divinum fecit, videatur n. 6854, 6914; 
illi interea a malis qui etiam fuerunt ab Ecclesia, ac vera fidei confessi, sed vitam mali vixerunt, infestabantur; illi qui ante Adventum Domini ab Ecclesia fuerunt, et mali quoad vitam, in tali falso 
fuerunt, quale non fuerat {4}antea, nec erit postea; causa erat quia illi qui Nephilim, tum Enakim et Rephaim, dicti sunt, et fuerunt ab extrema posteritate Antiquissimae Ecclesiae, nondum {5}inclusi 
fuerunt inferno, sed pervagati circum, ac infuderunt, ubicumque {6}potuerunt, persuasiones diras et mortiferas; ita quoque malis in Ecclesia; inde illis tale falsum; de Nephilim illis, et diris (c)illorum 
persuasionibus, videatur n. 310, {7} 560, 562, 563, 570, 581, 586, 607 fin., 660, 805, 808, 1034, 1120, 1265-1272, 1673; hi a Domino {8}cum fuit in mundo, conjecti sunt in infernum quod est a 
sinistro antrorsum ad aliquam distantiam; hoc nisi factum fuisset, paucissimi potuissent salvari, nam falsum quod illi infuderunt erat {9}cum persuasivo diro, ac letale, quale nusquam fuerat, et quale 
nusquam {10}esse potest; hoc falso imbuti fuerunt illi qui ante Adventum Domini infestarunt illos qui ab Ecclesia spirituali; haec sunt quae in sensu interno per illa verba intelliguntur; de illis in 
specie {11} agitur, in genere autem de omnibus qui ab Ecclesia et infestant probos in altera vita, quorum {12}perplures hodie sunt. 	@1 quod ante illam non fuit sicut illa, et post illam non ita erit 
sit quod tale, nempe falsum non fuerit a primo tempore Ecclesiae, et quod tale non erit, patet$ 	@2 i quod tale falsum non prius fuerit, nec postea erit,$ 	@3 nec$ 	@4 ante I$ 	@5 adhuc inclusi
