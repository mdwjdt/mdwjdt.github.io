<h3 align="center" class="ired">属天的奥秘 第1548节</h3>
<h4 align="center"></h4><p><strong>1548.</strong>“都往南地去”表进入属天之光。这从“南地”的含义清楚可知，“南地”是指内在之光的状态（如前所述，<a href="1458.htm">1458</a>节）。属天之光出自两种状态。第一种是人自婴幼儿时就被引入的的状态，因为众所周知，小孩子都处于天真无邪和爱之良善的状态，也就是他们最初被主所引入的属天之物，这些属天之物被储存在儿童里面，以备他以后的生活，以及进入来生时所用；这些就是前面数次提及的所谓“最初余留”。另一种状态则是人通过认知被引入属灵和属天之物的状态，这些认知必须被植入在自婴幼儿时就被赋予的属天之物中。对主而言，它们被植入在祂最初的属天之物中，主由此拥有在此被称为“南地”的光。</p><br />

<p><strong>[NCE]1548.</strong> The fact that toward the south means into heavenly light is established by the symbolism of the south, or noonday light,{*1} as a condition in which inner things are clear (discussed above at 搂<a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_1548/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_1458" target=_top>1458</a>).<br />There are two states that shine with heavenly light. The first is the one we enter in infancy. Most people recognize that little children have innocence and that they act in good and loving ways. These are heavenly traits, which the Lord first introduces us into, and he stores them up in us for use when we are older, and for use when we come into the other world. They are what are called the first remnant, described in many earlier places.{*2} In the second state, we are introduced to spiritual and heavenly concepts by learning about them, and these concepts need to be grafted onto the heavenly gifts we have received since infancy.<br />In the Lord, those concepts were grafted onto his earliest heavenly gifts. From this he gained light, and the light is called "the south" here.<br /><br /><strong>Footnotes:</strong><br />{*1} As mentioned in note 1 in 搂<a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_1548/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_458" target=_top>458</a>, the Latin word for the south (meridies) used by Swedenborg here also means "noon" or "noonday light." [LHC]<br />{*2} Swedenborg uses the term "remnant" variously to indicate actual survivors of a church, the remaining goodness of a church, or, as here, the true ideas and good feelings that make an impression on our minds from the time we are born. Some of the other places where he discusses the remnant are 搂搂<a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_1548/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_530" target=_top>530</a>, <a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_1548/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_560" target=_top>560-563</a>, <a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_1548/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_576" target=_top>576</a>, <a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_1548/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_660" target=_top>660-661</a>, <a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_1548/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_1050" target=_top>1050</a>.

Toward the south. That this signifies into celestial light, is evident from the signification of "the south," as being a state of light as to the interiors (spoken of before, n. 1458). There are two 
states from which comes celestial light. The first is that into which man is introduced from infancy; for it is known that infants are in innocence and in the goods of love, which are the celestial things 
into which they are at first introduced by the Lord, and which are stored up in the child for use in later life, and for his use when he comes into the other life; these are what are called the first 
remains, spoken of in several places before. The other state is, that man is introduced into spiritual and celestial things by means of knowledges, which must be implanted in the celestial things 
given from infancy. With the Lord, these were implanted in His first celestial things, from which He had the light which is here called "the south." </p>

'Towards the south' means into celestial light This is clear from the meaning of 'the south' as a state of light as regards interiors, dealt with already in <a href="1458.htm">1458</a>. There are two states from which celestial 
light is received The first is a state into which a person is introduced from earliest childhood, for it is well known that small children are in states of innocence and of goods stemming from love, 
which are the celestial things into which they are first brought by the Lord, and which are stored away in a person for use later in life and for his use when he enters the next life. These are what 
are called 'the first remnants' referred to several times already. The second state is one in which the individual is introduced into spiritual and celestial things by means of cognitions which have 
to be implanted in the celestial things with which he has been gifted since earliest childhood. In the Lord's case they were implanted in these earliest celestial things which He now had. From these 
He received the light which is here called 'the south'. </p>

'Versus meridiem': quod significet in lucem caelestem, constat a significatione 'meridiei' quod sit status lucidus quoad interiora, de qua prius n. 1458. Sunt bini status, ex quibus lux caelestis; primus 
est in quem introducitur homo ab infantia; notam enim est quod infantes in innocentia et in bonis amoris sint quae sunt caelestia, in quae primum introducuntur a Domino, et quae reconduntur ei in 
usum sequentis ejus aetatis, inque usum ejus cum venit in alteram vitam; haec sunt quae appellantur 'primae reliquiae,' de quibus passim prius: alter status est quod in spiritualia et caelestia introducatur 
per cognitiones, quae implantari debent caelestibus ab infantia donatis: haec apud Dominum Ipsius caelestibus primis implantata sunt; inde Ipsi lux, quae hic appellatur 'meridies.' </p>
