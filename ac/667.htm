<h4 align="center"></h4><p><strong>667.</strong>“你同你的妻与儿子、儿媳，都要进入方舟”表他会得救。这一点从上下文清楚可知，大意是，他得救是因为他已重生。</p>

<p><strong>[NCE]667.</strong> The meaning of he was to enter the ark, as were his sons and his wife and his sons' wives as the fact that they would be saved can be seen from the things said above. It can also be seen from things said below [<a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_667/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_711" target=_top>711</a>] showing that they would be saved through being reborn. </p>
<p align="center"><b>Potts(1905-1910) 667</b></p><p><b>667.</b>
Thou shalt enter into the ark, thou and thy sons, and thy wife, and thy sons' wives with thee. That this signifies that he would be saved, is evident from what has been said before and from what follows: 
that he was saved because regenerated. </p>

<p align="center"><b>Elliott(1983-1999) 667</b></p><p><b>667.</b>
'He was to enter into the ark, he and his sons, and his wife, and his sons' wives' means that he would be saved. This is clear from what has been stated already, and from what follows, to the effect 
that he was saved because he had been regenerated.  </p>

<p align="center"><b>Latin(1748-1756) 667</b>
</p><b>667.</b>
Quod 'is intraret in arcam, et filii ejus, et uxor ejus, et uxores filiorum ejus' significent quod salvaretur, constat ab illis quae prius dicta sunt, et quae sequuntur, quod salvatus quia regeneratus. </p>
