<h3 align="center" class="ired">属天的奥秘 第5275节</h3>
<h4 align="center"></h4><p><strong>5275.</strong>“看哪，必来七年”表提供的状态。这从“年”和“来”的含义清楚可知：“年”是指状态（参看<a href="487.htm">487</a>，<a href="488.htm">488</a>，<a href="493.htm">493</a>，<a href="893.htm">893</a>节）；“来”是指提供。因为“来”和“发生”（coming to pass）当论及神性或神所作的事时，表示照着提供所发生的事，因而是一种提供的行为；因为神所作的事表示提供（参看<a href="5264.htm">5264</a>，<a href="5273.htm">5273</a>节）。下面几节论述的主题是七个丰年和七个荒年，其中“年”表示状态：“丰年”是指属世层里面真理增多时的状态，“荒年”是指属世层里面真理缺乏和剥夺时的状态。一般来说，埃及地的七个丰年和七个荒年在内义上描述的是人被改造和重重时的状态，在至高意义上则描述了主的人身得到荣耀时的状态。这类事件发生在埃及地是为了代表这些事物；它们之所以发生在那里，是因为“埃及地”和“法老”在内义上表示属世层，对主里面的属世层的荣耀就是此处论述的主题。<br />要知道，那时发生并记载在圣言里的事件在至高意义上代表主自己和对祂人身的荣耀；在代表意义上则代表主的国，因而代表总体层面的教会和个体层面的教会。它们相应地代表人的重生，因为人通过重生被作成个体层面的教会。那时所发生的事就代表这类事物，这主要是为了圣言的缘故；好叫它能得以写成，因而能包含诸如将以连续的系列代表神性、属天和属灵事物的那类事物，从而不仅能为教会成员服务，还能为天上的天使服务。天使从这些代表性的描述感知神性事物，由此充满神圣感；这些神圣感就被传给带着情感阅读圣言的那个人；他也由此获得一种神圣感。这就是为何这类事件发生在埃及地的原因。</p>

Behold there come seven years. That this signifies states of providence, is evident from the signification of "years," as being states (see n. 487, 488, 493, 893); and from the signification of "coming," 
as being of providence. For "coming" and "coming to pass," when predicated of the Divine or of that which God does, denotes that which happens in accordance with providence, and consequently is of 
providence. (That what God does is providence may be seen above, n. 5264, 5273.) The seven years of abundance of produce and the seven years of famine are treated of in the following verses, and there 
by "years" are signified states-by the "years of abundance of produce," states of the multiplication of truth in the natural, and by the "years of famine," states of the lack and privation of truth 
in the natural. In general by the seven years of abundance of produce and the seven years of famine in the land of Egypt are described in the internal sense the states of man's reformation and regeneration, 
and in the supreme sense the states of the glorification of the Lord's Human. It was in order that these things might be represented that such events took place in the land of Egypt; and they 
took place there because by the land of Egypt and by Pharaoh is meant in the internal sense the natural, the glorification of which in the Lord is here treated of.  [2] Be it known that the things which 
came to pass at that time, and which are described in the Word, were representative of the Lord Himself, of the glorifying of His Human, and in the representative sense of His kingdom, consequently 
of the church in general and of the church in the singular, and thus of the regeneration of man; for by regeneration a man is made the church in the singular. That what took place at that time was representative 
of such things, was chiefly for the sake of the Word, that it might be written, and thus might contain such things as would represent Divine, celestial, and spiritual things in continuous 
series, and thus might be of service not only to the man of the church, but also to the angels in heaven; for the angels perceive from it Divine things, and thereby are affected with holy feelings that 
are communicated to the man who reads the Word with affection, whence he also feels the holiness. This is the reason why such events took place in the land of Egypt. </p>

<p align="center"><b>Elliott(1983-1999) 5275</b></p><p><b>5275.</b>
'Behold, seven years are coming' means a state of providence. This is clear from the meaning of 'years' as states, dealt with in <a href="487.htm">487</a>, <a href="488.htm">488</a>, <a href="493.htm">493</a>, <a href="893.htm">893</a>; and from the meaning of 'coming' as an act of providence. 
For 'coming' and being done, when used in reference to the Divine, or to that which God does, means what happens providentially and is therefore an act of providence; for providence is meant by 
that done by God, see above in <a href="5264.htm">5264</a>, <a href="5273.htm">5273</a>. Regarding the seven years of abundance of corn and the seven years of famine that are the subject in what follows, where 'years' means states, 'the years of 
abundance of corn' are states when truth is multiplied in the natural, and 'the years of famine' are states when there is an absence and deprivation of truth in the natural. In general the seven years 
of abundance of corn and the seven years of famine in the land of Egypt describe in the internal sense the state when a person is reformed and regenerated, and in the highest sense the state when the 
Lord's Human was glorified. To represent these things was why such events took place in the land of Egypt. The reason that land was the one where they took place is that in the internal sense 'the 
land of Egypt' and 'Pharaoh' mean the natural, the glorification of which within the Lord is the subject here. </p>
<p></p>
<p><b>[2]</b>
 It should be recognized that the events which took place at that time and have been 
recorded in the Word were representative in the highest sense of the Lord Himself and of the glorification of His Human, and in the representative sense of His kingdom, and consequently of the Church 
at a corporate level and also of the Church at an individual level. They were accordingly representative of a person's regeneration, for regeneration is the means by which a person becomes a Church 
at the individual level. The representation of such things by the events happening at that time was primarily for the sake of the Word - so that this could be written and thus be a Word that would contain 
the kinds of matters that would represent Divine, celestial, and spiritual realities in a continuous line of thought, and so would be of service not only to the member of the Church but also to the 
angels in heaven. From those representative descriptions angels perceive Divine realities and are thereby filled with holy feelings which are communicated to the person who reads the Word with affection; 
for he too receives a feeling of holiness. This is the reason why such events took place in the land of Egypt. </p>

`Ecce septem anni veniunt': quod significet status providentiae, constat ex significatione `annorum' quod sint status, de qua n. 487, 488, 493, 893; et ex significatione `venire' quod sit providentiae, 
venire enim ac fieri, cum praedicatur de Divino seu de eo quod Deus facit, est id quod evenit ex providentia, {1}proinde est providentiae; quod id quod Deus facit, sit providentia, videatur supra 
n. 5264, 5273. De septem annis abundantiae annonae et septem annis famis agitur in sequentibus, et ibi per `annos' significantur status, per `annos abundantiae annonae' status multiplicationis veri in 
naturali, et per `annos famis' status defectus et privationis veri in naturali; in genere per `septem annos abundantiae annonae et septem annos famis in terra Aegypti' in sensu interno describuntur status 
reformationis et regenerationis hominis, et in sensu supremo status glorificationis Humani Domini; ut illa repraesentarentur, evenerunt talia in terra Aegypti; quod ibi, erat quia per `terram Aegypti' 
et per `Pharaonem' in sensu interno intelligitur naturale, de cujus glorificatione in Domino ibi agitur. [2] Sciendum quod illa quae eo tempore fiebant et in Verbo descripta sunt, repraesentativa 
fuerint {2}Ipsius Domini, Humani Ipsius glorificationis, et in sensu repraesentativo Ipsius regni, consequenter Ecclesiae in communi et Ecclesiae in singulari, ita regenerationis hominis, nam per regenerationem 
fit homo Ecclesia in singulari; quod repraesentativa talium essent quae eo tempore fiebant, erat imprimis propter Verbum ut hoc conscriberetur, et sic Verbum contineret talia quae repraesentarent 
Divina, caelestia et spiritualia in continua serie, et ita inserviret non solum homini Ecclesiae sed etiam angelis in caelo; angeli enim inde Divina percipiunt, et sic afficiuntur sanctis quae 
communicantur homini qui ex affectione legit Verbum, unde (e)ei quoque sanctum; haec causa est quod talia evenerint in terra Aegypti.  @1 hoc est,$ @2 i in supremo sensu$ </p>
