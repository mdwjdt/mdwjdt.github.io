<h4 align="center"></h4><p><strong>7766.</strong>“我再使一样灾殃临到法老和埃及”表荒凉的最后阶段，也就是诅咒。这从“再一样的灾殃”的含义清楚可知，“再一样的灾殃”是指荒凉的最后阶段。临到埃及的灾殃表示荒凉的相继状态，这一点从前面的解释明显看出来。最后阶段是诅咒，即对与仁分离之信的诅咒，这一点从下文可以看出来；因为在埃及杀死长子表示对这信的诅咒；“死亡”是指诅咒，“长子”是指信。当信的事物被用来支持虚假和邪恶时，就说信受到诅咒。当用来支持这些虚假和邪恶时，信的事物就投奔到它们那一边，变成认可它们的一种手段。这就是那些既在教义上，也在生活上将信与仁分离之人的情形。而事实上，这些人没有信，只有诸如对属于信的那类事物的记忆知识，他们把这种知识称为信。这就是被诅咒之信的意思。此外，信的事物与虚假并邪恶已在自己里面结合的人在经历荒凉的各个阶段之后，就会陷入诅咒。对他们的诅咒因他们所散发的腐烂、恶臭而变得可以感知，比那些不具有信之事物的人所散发出来的还要难闻。特殊和一般的情况是一样的；一般来说，如果一个恶灵靠近有仁爱存在的天堂社群，该社群的居民就会明显闻到他所散发的恶臭。他们在特殊情况下也是这样，也就是在诸如属于天堂的那类事物，就是信的事物，与诸如属于地狱的那类事物在一个人里面共存的情况下。由此明显可知，“再使一样灾殃临到法老和埃及”表示荒凉的最后阶段，也就是诅咒。因为“法老”代表那些已经成为侵扰者的人，在此代表那些正受到诅咒的人；“埃及”表示属世心智（<a href="5276.htm">5276</a>，<a href="5278.htm">5278</a>，<a href="5280.htm">5280</a>，<a href="5288.htm">5288</a>，<a href="5301.htm">5301</a>，<a href="6147.htm">6147</a>，<a href="6252.htm">6252</a>节）。</p>

Yet one plague more will I bring upon, Pharaoh, and upon Egypt. That this signifies the end of vastation, which is damnation, is evident from the signification of "yet one plague more," as being the 
last of vastation. That by the plagues brought upon Egypt were signified successive states of vastation, is evident from the explication of what goes before; that the last is damnation, namely, of faith 
separate from charity, will be seen from what follows; for by the firstborn given up to death in Egypt is signified the damnation of this faith; by "death," the damnation itself; and by "the firstborn," 
faith. Faith is said to be damned when the things of faith are applied to support falsities and evils; and when they support these, they pass over to their side, and become a means of confirming 
them. This is the case with those who both in doctrine and in life separate faith from charity; but with these there is no faith; there is only the memory-knowledge of such things as are of faith, which 
knowledge is by them called faith. This is meant by faith damned. Moreover, the subjects themselves in whom the things of faith have been adjoined to falsities and evils, after vastations are in damnation. 
The damnation is made sensible by the putrid and offensive stench which exhales from them, more than from those who have not been possessed of the things of faith. This is the case in particular 
as in general; in general, if any evil spirit approaches a heavenly society where there is charity, the stench from him is plainly perceived; in like manner in particular where there had been such 
things as are of heaven, that is, such as are of faith, and in the same subject also such things as are of hell. From all this it is now evident that by "yet one plague more which shall be brought upon 
Pharaoh and upon Egypt" is signified the last of vastation, which is damnation; for by Pharaoh are represented those who have infested, and who are here being damned; and by "Egypt" is signified the 
natural mind (n. 5276, 5278, 5280, 5288, 5301, 6147, 6252). </p>

'One more plague I will bring onto Pharaoh and onto Egypt' means the final stage of vastation, which is damnation. This is clear from the meaning of 'one more plague' as the last stage of vastation. 
It is evident from the explanation of what has gone before that the plagues brought onto Egypt meant consecutive states of vastation. The fact that the last stage is damnation - the damnation of faith 
separated from charity - will be evident from what is to follow; for the killing in Egypt of the firstborn means the damnation of that faith, 'death' being damnation and 'the firstborn' faith. Faith 
is said to be damned when matters of faith are used to support falsities and evils. When used in support of these, matters of faith go over to their side and become endorsements of them. This happens 
with those who separate faith from charity in both doctrine and life. But no faith in fact resides with them, only knowledge of such things as are matters of faith, though they call that knowledge faith. 
This is what one should understand by faith that is damned. Furthermore the people themselves in whom such matters of faith have been linked to falsities and evils end up in damnation after undergoing 
stages of vastation. Their damnation is made perceptible by the rotten and foul stink that emanates from them, worse than any emitted by those who have never subscribed to matters of faith. Their 
situation in particular is the same as that which arises in a general way. Generally, if an evil spirit approaches a heavenly community, where charity exists, its inhabitants smell plainly the foul stink 
emanating from him. They do so in particular situations in which such things as belong to heaven, that is, matters of faith, have co-existed in a person with such things as belong to hell. From all 
this it is now evident that 'one more plague which will be brought onto Pharaoh and onto Egypt' means the last stage of vastation, which is damnation. For 'Pharaoh' represents those who have been molesters, 
at this point those who are damned, and 'Egypt' means the natural mind, <a href="5276.htm">5276</a>, <a href="5278.htm">5278</a>, <a href="5280.htm">5280</a>, <a href="5288.htm">5288</a>, <a href="5301.htm">5301</a>, <a href="6147.htm">6147</a>, <a href="6252.htm">6252</a>. </p>

`Adhuc plagam unam adducam super Pharaonem, et super Aegyptum': quod significet finem vastationis, qui damnatio, constat ex significatione `adhuc plagae unius' quod sit ultimum vastationis.  Quod per 
`plagas super Aegyptum adductas' significati sint status successivi vastationis, a praecedentium explicatione patet; quod ultimum sit damnatio, nempe fidei separatae a charitate, patebit a sequentibus, 
nam per `primogenita {1} morti data in Aegypto' significatur damnatio illius fidei; per `mortem' ipsa damnatio, et per `primogenita' fides; {2} fides dicitur damnata quando illa quae fidei sunt applicantur 
ad patrocinandum falsis et malis; quando illis patrocinantur, transeunt ad partes illorum et fiunt confirmantia; hoc fit apud illos qui et doctrina et vita separant fidem a charitate; sed apud 
hos non est fides; est modo scientia talium quae fidei, quae ab illis vocatur fides; hoc intelligitur per fidem damnatam; insuper ipsa subjecta, in quibus talia quae fidei sunt adjuncta falsis et malis 
fuerunt, post vastationes in damnatione sunt; damnatio sentitur per putorem et fetorem qui ex illis exhalat, plus quam ab illis apud quos non talia quae fidei sunt fuerunt; se habet hoc in particulari 
sicut in communi; in communi, si malas spiritus accedit ad societatem caelestem ubi charitas, sentitur manifeste ab illo fetor; similiter in particulari, ubi talia fuerant quae caeli, hoc est, quae 
fidei, et in eodem subjecto etiam talia quae inferni.  Ex his nunc patet quod per `adhuc plagam unam, quae adducetur super Pharaonem et super Aegyptum' significetur ultimum vastationis, quod est damnatio; 
per `Pharaonem' enim repraesentantur illi qui infestarunt, hic qui damnantur; et per `Aegyptum' significatur mens naturalis, n. 5276, 5278, 5280, 5288, 5301, 6147, 6252. 	@1 i quae$ 	@2 The 
remainder of this   has been much altered from the form in A, which reads: (s)fides dicitur damnari, quando illa quae fidei sunt, applicantur ad patrocinandum falsis et malis, cum illis patrocinatur 
adjungunt se illis et transeunt ad partes falsi et mali, hoc fit quando fides separatur a charitate, sed tunc fides non amplius est fides, modo vocatur ita, hoc intelligitur per fidem damnatam; insuper 
ipsa subjecta in quibus talis fides separata a charitate et adjuncta falsis et malis fuerat, post vastationes damnantur, damnatio sentitur per putorem et faetorem, qui ex illis exhalat, nam ubi talia 
quae fidei fuerant, cum evacuantur seu vastantur ab illis putent et faetent plus quam ubi falsa et mala fuerant absque talibus quae fidei; se habet in particulari sicut in communi, in communi si malus 
spiritus accedit ad societatem caelestem ubi charitas, tunc putor ac faetor manifeste sentitur ab illo, similiter in particulari ubi talia fuerant quae caeli, hoc est, quae fidei, et in eodem subjecto 
etiam talia quae inferni,(s) quod percipitur ex sphaera inde exhalata, hoc ultimum vastationis, quod est damnati significatur per adhuc plagam unam quae adducetur super Pharaonem; per Pharaonem enim 
repraesentantur illi qui nunc damnantur, et per Aegyptum significatur mens naturalis, n. 5276, 5278, 5280, 5288, 5301, 6147, 6252.$ </p>
