<h3 align="center" class="ired">属天的奥秘 第1733节</h3>
<h4 align="center"></h4><p><strong>1733.</strong>“天地的主宰”表内在人，或耶和华与内层人和外层人的结合。这从“天地”的含义清楚可知。人里面的内层之物被称为“天”，外层之物被称为“地”。天表人里面的内层之物，其原因在于，就内层之物而言，人是天堂的一个形像，因而是一个微型天堂。主的内层人本来就是天堂，因为主是天堂的全部中的全部，因而是天堂本身。由此可知，外层人被称为地。也由于同样的原因，先知书和启示录中提及的“新天”和“新地”无非表示主的国度，和每一个是主的国度之人，也就是里面有主的国度之人。至于“天地”具有这些含义，可参看前文（关于“天”，参看<a href="82.htm">82</a>，<a href="911.htm">911</a>节；关于“地”，参看<a href="82.htm">82</a>，<a href="620.htm">620</a>，<a href="636.htm">636</a>，<a href="913.htm">913</a>节）。<br />“天地的主宰、至高的神”表主里面的内在人与内层人和外层人的结合。这从以下事实可以看出来：就内在人而言，主就是耶和华自己，因为内在人或耶和华指引并教导外在人，就象父亲教导儿子。因此，相对耶和华来说，外在人被称为神的儿子；但相对母亲来说，外在人被称为人子。在此被称为“至高神”的，就是主的内在人，也就是耶和华自己。在实现完全的结合或联结之前，它被称为“天地的主宰”，也就是内层人和外层人中一切事物的主宰。因为如前所述，这些事物就是此处“天地”所表示的。</p>

<p><strong>[NCE]1733.</strong> Possessor of the heavens and the earth symbolizes the bonding of his inner self (Jehovah) with his intermediate and outer selves, as the symbolism of heaven and earth shows. Anything comparatively deep inside us is called heaven, and anything on the surface is called the earth. The reason heaven symbolizes what lies relatively deep inside us is that our deeper levels are an image of heaven and therefore are a kind of miniature heaven. The Lord's intermediate self is quintessentially heaven because he is the all-in-all of heaven and therefore is heaven itself. The fact that our outer self is called the earth follows naturally. The new heavens and the new earth mentioned in the prophets and Revelation, then, actually mean the Lord's kingdom and everyone who typifies the Lord's kingdom, or who has the Lord's kingdom inside.{*1} To see that heaven and earth have these meanings, look at what is said about heaven in <a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_1733/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_82" target=_top>82</a>, <a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_1733/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_911" target=_top>911</a>, and about the earth in <a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_1733/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_82" target=_top>82</a>, <a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_1733/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_620" target=_top>620</a>, <a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_1733/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_636" target=_top>636</a>, <a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_1733/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_913" target=_top>913</a>.<br />[2] The symbolism here of God the Highest, possessor of the heavens and the earth, as the bonding of the inner self with the intermediate and outer selves in the Lord can be seen from this: In regard to his inner self, the Lord was Jehovah himself. Because his inner self or Jehovah guided and taught his outer self, as a parent does a child, his outer self is called Child of God [divine offspring] in relation to Jehovah, but Child of Humankind [human offspring] in relation to his mother. The Lord's inner being, Jehovah himself, is what is being called God the Highest. As full union (or oneness) has not yet occurred, it is also called possessor of the heavens and the earth — that is, possessor of everything in the intermediate and outer selves meant here by the heavens and the earth (as noted).<br /><br /><strong>Footnotes:</strong><br />{*1} New heavens and a new earth (or "new land") are mentioned in <a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_1733/bible_king-james-version_isaiah_65_17" target=_top>Isaiah 65:17</a>; <a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_1733/bible_king-james-version_isaiah_66_22" target=_top>66:22</a>; <a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_1733/bible_king-james-version_revelation_21_1" target=_top>Revelation 21:1</a>. Swedenborg is also referring to the new land of Israel described in <a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_1733/bible_king-james-version_ezekiel_40_1-49" target=_top>Ezekiel 40</a>-<a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_1733/bible_king-james-version_ezekiel_48_1-35" target=_top>48</a>, as his remarks in <a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_1733/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_3858#subsection-2-4" target=_top>3858:4</a> make plain.

Possessor of the heavens and the earth. This signifies the conjunction of the internal man or Jehovah with the interior and the exterior man, as appears from the signification of "heaven and earth." 
That which is interior in man is called "heaven;" and that which is exterior is called "earth." The reason why "heaven" signifies that which is interior in man, is that a man as to his interiors is an 
image of heaven, and so is a kind of little heaven. Primarily the Lord's interior man is heaven, because the Lord is the all in all of heaven, and thus is heaven itself. It follows from this that the 
exterior man is called the earth. For the same reason also, by the "new heavens" and the "new earth," spoken of in the Prophets and in Revelation, nothing else is meant than the Lord's kingdom, and everyone 
who is a kingdom of the Lord, or in whom the Lord's kingdom is. That "heaven and earth" signify these things may be seen, as to "heaven," n. 82, 911; and as to "earth," n. 82, 620, 636, 913.  [2] 
That here "God Most High, Possessor of the heavens and earth," signifies the conjunction in the Lord of the internal man with the interior and exterior man, may be seen from the fact that as to His 
internal man the Lord was Jehovah Himself; and because the internal man or Jehovah led and instructed the external, as a father his son, therefore relatively to Jehovah He is called, as to the external 
man, the "Son of God;" but relatively to the mother, He is called the "Son of Man." The Lord's internal man, which is Jehovah Himself, is what is here called "God Most High;" and before plenary conjunction 
or union was effected, it is called "Possessor of the heavens and earth," that is, Possessor of all things which are in the interior and the exterior man; for these, as before said, are here 
meant by "the heavens and the earth." </p>

'Possessor of heaven and earth' means the conjunction of the Internal Man, or Jehovah, with the Interior and the Exterior Man. This is clear from the meaning of 'heaven and earth'. That which is interior 
in man is called 'heaven', and that which is exterior 'earth'. The reason heaven means that which is interior in man is that man as regards interior things is an image of heaven, and so a miniature 
heaven. The Lord's Interior Man primarily is heaven, for the Lord is the All in all of heaven, and thus heaven itself. The exterior man's being called 'the earth' follows as a consequence of this. 
Here also is the reason why 'the new heaven and the new earth' described in the Prophets and in the Book of Revelation is used to mean nothing other than the Lord's kingdom and every person who is the 
Lord's kingdom, that is, who has the Lord's kingdom within him. As regards heaven and earth having these meanings, see <a href="82.htm">82</a>, <a href="911.htm">911</a>, for heaven, and <a href="82.htm">82</a>, <a href="620.htm">620</a>, <a href="636.htm">636</a>, <a href="913.htm">913</a>, for earth. </p>

<p><b>[2]</b>
 That 'God Most High, 
Possessor of heaven and earth' here means the conjunction of the Internal Man with the Interior and Exterior Man in the Lord becomes clear from the consideration that the Lord as regards the Internal 
Man was Jehovah Himself; and because the Internal Man or Jehovah guided and instructed the External Man - as the Father did the Son - the External Man considered in relation to Jehovah is therefore 
called the Son of God, but in relation to the mother the Son of Man. The Lord's Internal Man, which is Jehovah Himself, is that which is here called 'God Most High', and until complete conjunction or 
union had taken place it is called 'Possessor of heaven and earth', that is, Possessor of all that resided in the Interior and Exterior Man, which, as has been stated, is here meant by 'heaven and earth'. </p>

'Possessori caelorum et terrae': quod significet Interni Hominis seu Jehovae conjunctionem cum Interiore et Exteriore, constat ex significatione 'caeli et terrae'; 'caelum' appellatur illud quod interius 
est in homine, et 'terra' illud quod exterius; quod caelum significet illud quod interius est in homine, causa est quia homo quoad interiora est imago caeli, et sic exiguum quoddam caelum; Interior 
Domini Homo principaliter est caelum, quia Dominus est omne in omnibus caeli, ita ipsum caelum: quod exterior homo appelletur 'terra,' inde sequitur; quam etiam per 'novos caelos et novam terram,' 
de quibus apud Prophetas et in Apocalypsi, nihil aliud intelligitur quam regnum Domini, et unusquisque qui est regnum Domini seu in quo est regnum Domini; quod caelum et terra illa significent, videatur 
de caelo n. 82, 911, et de terra n. 82, 620, 636, 913.  [2] Quod hic 'Deus Altissimus possessor caelorum et terrae' significet Interni Hominis conjunctionem cum Interiore et Exteriore apud Dominum, 
constare potest ex eo quod Dominus quoad Internum Hominem fuerit Ipse Jehovah, et quia Internus Homo seu Jehovah duxit et instruxit Externum, ut Pater Filium; ideo dicitur quoad Externum Hominem respective 
ad Jehovam 'Filius Dei,' at respective ad matrem 'Filius hominis'; Internus Domini Homo, Qui Ipse Jehovah, est Qui hic dicitur 'Deus Altissimus,' et antequam conjunctio plenaria seu unio facta, 
dicitur 'Possessor caelorum et terrae,' hoc est, Possessor omnium quae apud Interiorem et Exteriorem Hominem, qui hic per 'caelos et terram' intelliguntur, ut dictum. </p>
