<h3 align="center" class="ired">属天的奥秘 第8143节</h3>
<h4 align="center"></h4><p><strong>8143.</strong>“法老和他的臣仆就向百姓变心”表一种状态的改变，即进入那些沉浸于邪恶所生的虚假之人里面的邪恶的一种改变。这从“变心”和“臣仆”的含义，以及“法老”和“以色列人”的代表清楚可知。“变心”是指进入邪恶的一种状态的改变；“变”表示经历一种改变，在此是指一种心智的改变，因而指一种状态的改变，这是显而易见的；“心”表示邪恶（参看<a href="8135.htm">8135</a>节）。“法老”是指那些沉浸于邪恶所生的虚假之人（<a href="8132.htm">8132</a>节）。“臣仆”是指那些等级较低、进行服事的人，由于所指的是这些人，故所指的是所有和每个沉浸于邪恶所生的虚假之人（<a href="7396.htm">7396</a>节）。“以色列人”是指那些属于属灵教会的人。由此明显可知，“法老和他的臣仆就向百姓变心”表示一种状态的改变，即进入反对那些属于属灵教会之人的所有沉浸于邪恶所生的虚假之人里面的邪恶的一种改变。</p>

<p align="center"><b>Potts(1905-1910) 8143</b></p><p><b>8143.</b>
And the heart of Pharaoh and of his servants was turned against the people. That this signifies a change of state into evil in the case of those who were in falsities from evil, is evident from the signification 
of "the heart being turned," as being a change of state into evil; (that "to be turned," denotes to be changed, here as to the mind, thus as to the state, is evident, and that "heart" denotes 
evil see above, n. 8135); from the representation of Pharaoh, as being those who are in falsities from evil (n. 8132); from the signification of "servants," as being those who are of lower condition, 
and who minister, consequently all and each who are in falsities from evil (n. 7396), and from the representation of the sons of Israel, as being those who are of the spiritual church. Hence it is 
evident that by "the heart of Pharaoh and of his servants being turned against the people," is signified a change of state into evil in the case of all those who are in falsities from evil, against 
those who are of the spiritual church. </p>

<p align="center"><b>Elliott(1983-1999) 8143</b></p><p><b>8143.</b>
'And the heart of Pharaoh and his servants was turned against the people' means a change of state, a change to evil within those steeped in falsities arising from evil. This is clear from the meaning 
of 'the turning of the heart' as a change of state, to evil (the fact that 'being turned' means undergoing a change - at this point a change of mind, and so a change of state - is self-evident; and for 
the meaning of 'heart' as evil, see above in <a href="8135.htm">8135</a>); from the representation of 'Pharaoh' as those steeped in falsities arising from evil, dealt with above in <a href="8132.htm">8132</a>; from the meaning of 'servants' as 
those who belong to a lower rank and minister, and since these are meant, each and every one steeped in falsities arising from evil is meant, <a href="7396.htm">7396</a>; and from the representation of 'the children of Israel' 
as those who belong to the spiritual Church. From all this it is evident that 'the heart of Pharaoh and his servants was turned against the people' means a change of state, a change to evil feelings 
within all those steeped in falsities arising from evil, directed against those belonging to the spiritual Church. </p>

`Et conversum est cor Pharaonis et servorum illius contra populum': quod significet mutationem status in malum penes illos qui in falsis a malo, constat (c)ex significatione `converti cor' quod sit 
mutatio status in malum; quod `converti' sit mutari, hic quoad animum, ita quoad statum, patet; et quod `cor' sit malum, videatur supra n. 8135; ex repraesentatione `Pharaonis' quod sint {1}qui in falsis 
ex malo, de qua supra n. 8132; ex significatione `servorum' quod sint qui inferioris sortis sunt (c)et ministrant, et quia illi, significantur {2} omnes et singuli qui in falsis (c)ex malo, n. 7396; 
et ex repraesentatione `filiorum Israelis' {3} quod sint qui ab Ecclesia spirituali; inde patet quod per `conversum est cor Pharaonis et servorum illius contra populum' significetur mutatio status
