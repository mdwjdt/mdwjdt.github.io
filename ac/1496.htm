<h3 align="center" class="ired">属天的奥秘 第1496节</h3>
<h4 align="center"></h4><p><strong>1496.</strong>“以致我把她取来要作我的妻子”表祂因此可能已向要与属天之物联结的真理施暴。这从刚才以及前面（12:13）所述清楚可知。至于与属天之物结合的真理，情况是这样：就本身而言，童年所学到的真理无非是适合接受属天之物的容器。真理凭自身没有任何生命可言，只能凭所流入的属天之物拥有生命。属天之物是爱和仁；一切真理由此而来，并且一切真理因由此而来，故无非是一种容器。而且，在来世，真理本身是显而易见的；在那里，被看到的不是真理，而是它们里面所蕴含的生命，即它们里面构成爱和仁的属天之物。真理正是通过这些事物而变得属天，被称为属天的真理。由此清楚可知何为智性真理，以及智性真理开辟了一条通往主所具有的属天之物的道路。记忆的真理是一回事，理性真理是另一回事，而智性真理则又是一回事；它们依次跟进。记忆的真理是知识的事，理性真理是由推理所确认的真理，而智性真理则与“是就是”的内在直觉相结合。主在童年时就具有这种真理，并且它在主里面开辟了一条通往属天之物的道路。</p><br />

<p><strong>[NCE]1496.</strong> I would have taken her for my woman means that in his ignorance he could have abused the truth that was to be wedded to a heavenly quality, as can be seen from the remarks just above and from earlier remarks at verse <a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_1496/bible_king-james-version_genesis_12_13" target=_top>13</a> [搂搂<a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_1496/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_1475" target=_top>1475-1476</a>].<br />In regard to the idea that truth would be wedded to something heavenly, the case is this: Viewed in itself, the truth that we learn when we are young is just a vessel designed for the infusion of a heavenly essence. Truth has no life on its own, only from the heavenly dimension that enters into it. The heavenly dimension is love and charity; this is the source of all truth. And since all truth comes from this source, truth is nothing but a kind of vessel.<br />Truth also plainly displays itself as a vessel in the other world. In that world, people never regard truth from the viewpoint of truth but from that of the life within it. In other words, they regard it from the viewpoint of heavenly traits, which are traits of love and charity within the truth. These traits cause truth to be heavenly and to be called heavenly truth.<br />This evidence now shows what intuitive truth is. It also demonstrates that for the Lord, intuitive truth opened the path to heavenly qualities.<br />Factual truth, rational truth, and intuitive truth are three separate things, which come one after the other. Factual truth is the product of secular knowledge. Rational truth is factual truth logically proved. Intuitive truth is truth united to an inner perception that the thing is so.{*1} The Lord received this kind of truth while he was still young, and in him it opened the path to heavenly qualities.<br /><br /><strong>Footnotes:</strong><br />{*1} On "intuitive truth," or intellectual truth, see note 1 in 搂<a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_1496/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_1402" target=_top>1402</a>.

I might have taken her to me for a woman. That this signifies that so the truth that was to be conjoined with what is celestial might have suffered violence, is evident from what has just been said; 
and also from what was said above at verse 13. As regards truth being conjoined with what is celestial, the case is this. Regarded in itself, the truth learned from childhood is nothing but a vessel adapted 
to the reception of what is celestial. Truth has no life from itself, but only from the celestial that flows in. The celestial is love and charity; all truth is thence, and because all truth is 
thence it is nothing but a kind of vessel; and so are truths themselves plainly presented in the other life; truths there are never regarded from truths, but from the life which is in them; that is, 
from the celestial things which are of love and charity in the truths; from these it is that truths become celestial, and are called celestial truths. We can now see what intellectual truth is, as also 
that with the Lord intellectual truth opened the way to celestial things. Truth in the memory [verum scientificum] is one thing; rational truth is another; and intellectual truth is another; they succeed 
one another. Truth in the memory is a matter of memory-knowledge; rational truth is this truth confirmed by reason; intellectual truth is conjoined with an internal perception that it is so. This 
intellectual truth existed with the Lord in His childhood, and with Him opened the way to celestial things. </p>

'I might have taken her to be my wife (mulier)' means that this being so He could have done violence to the truth that was to be joined to what is celestial. This becomes clear from what has just been 
stated as well as from what was stated above at verse 13. As to truth being joined to that which is celestial, the situation is that regarded in itself truth learned in childhood is nothing else than 
a vessel adapted for that which is celestial to be introduced into it. By itself truth has no life except from the celestial flowing in. The celestial consists in love and charity, and all truth exists 
from these; and because all truth exists from these it is nothing else than a kind of vessel. What is more, truths themselves are plainly manifested as such in the next life, for there it is not the 
truths themselves that are seen but the life they have within them, that is, the celestial things within them that consist of love and charity. It is from these that truths are made celestial and are 
called celestial truths. From this it may now become clear what intellectual truth is, and also that intellectual truth opened a way to celestial things residing with the Lord. Factual truth is one 
thing, rational truth another, and intellectual truth yet another. They follow on consecutively. Factual truth is a matter of knowledge; rational truth is factual truth confirmed by reason; while intellectual 
truth is joined to an internal perception that the thing is so. This kind of truth resided with the Lord in childhood, and with Him opened the way to celestial things. </p>

Quod 'accepissem illam mihi in mulierem' significet quod sic violari potuisset verum quod conjungeretur caelesti, constare potest ab illis quae nunc dicta sunt, tum ab illis quae supra ad vers. 13. 
Quod verum conjungeretur caelesti, ita se habet: verum in se spectatum, quod a pueritia discitur, non est nisi vas aptum cui caeleste insinuari possit; verum a se non habet aliquam vitam, sed a caelesti 
quod influit; caeleste est amor et charitas, omne verum est inde; et quia omne verum est inde, non est aliud quam quoddam vas; ipsa vera quoque ita perspicua sistuntur in altera vita; ibi nusquam spectantur 
vera a veris, sed a vita quae in illis, hoc est, a caelestibus quae sunt amoris et charitatis in veris; ex illis vera fiunt caelestia, et appellantur vera caelestia; ex his nunc constare potest 
quid verum intellectuale, tam quod verum intellectuale aperuerit viam ad caelestia apud Dominum.  Aliud est verum scientificum, aliud verum rationale, et aliud veram intellectuale; succedunt sibi; 
verum scientificum est scientiae; verum rationale est verum scientificum ratione confirmatum; verum intellectuale est conjunctum cum perceptione interna quod ita sit; hoc apud Dominum fuit in pueritia, 
et apud Ipsum aperuit viam ad caelestia. </p>
