<h4 align="center"></h4><p><strong>6397.</strong>“必判断他的民，作以色列支派之一”表它是以色列支派所代表的总体上的真理之一。这从“判断”、“民”和“以色列支派”的含义清楚可知：“判断”是指行使其功能的真理，如下文所述；“民”是指那些处于真理的人（<a href="1259.htm">1259</a>，<a href="1260.htm">1260</a>，<a href="2928.htm">2928</a>，<a href="3295.htm">3295</a>，<a href="3581.htm">3581</a>，<a href="4619.htm">4619</a>节），在此是指那些处于真理，尚未处于良善的人，因为他们是“但”，也就是“但”的人民（<a href="6396.htm">6396</a>节）；“以色列支派”是指总体上信的全部真理和良善（参看<a href="3858.htm">3858</a>，<a href="3926.htm">3926</a>，<a href="3939.htm">3939</a>，<a href="4060.htm">4060</a>，<a href="6335.htm">6335</a>节）。因此，“必判断他的民，作以色列支派之一”表示“但”所代表的这真理是“以色列支派”所代表的总体真理之一。“必判断他的民”之所以表示行使其适当功能的真理，是因为“以色列支派”代表总体上的全部真理，这一点从前面引用的经文可以看出来；施行审判的是真理，因此“判断他的民”表示行使其功能的真理。<br />在圣言中，我们读到：二十四位长老要坐在宝座上审判列族和列民；十二使徒同样要坐在宝座上审判以色列的十二个支派。不知道圣言内义的人可能以为这种事真的会发生。但当人从内义知道“二十四位长老”、“十二使徒”、“宝座”表示什么，即作为一个整体的全部真理，审判便照着这些真理实现，那么该如何理解这些描述就变得显而易见了。“审判他的民，作以色列支派之一”在此所表相同。并不是说他们，或他们当中的任何一位长老会进行审判；而是说他们所表示的真理会进行审判；因此，唯独主进行审判，因为一切真理皆从祂发出。论到要坐在宝座上进行审判的二十四位长老，经上在启示录如此记着说：<br />宝座的周围又有二十四个宝座；我看见二十四位长老坐在宝座上，身穿白衣，头上戴着金冠冕。（启示录<a href="http://39-27.cn/启4.4.htm">4:4</a>；<a href="http://39-27.cn/启11.16.htm">11:16</a>）<br /><br />我又看见几个宝座，他们坐在上面，并有审判的权柄赐给他们。（启示录<a href="http://39-27.cn/启20.4.htm">20:4</a>）<br />论到十二使徒，经上在马太福音如此记着说：<br />耶稣却对他们说，你们这跟从我的人，到重生的时候，人子坐在祂荣耀的宝座上，你们也要坐在十二个宝座上，审判以色列十二个支派。（马太福音<a href="http://39-27.cn/太19.28.htm">19:28</a>）<br />路加福音：<br />我将国赐给你们，正如我父赐给我一样，叫你们在我国里，坐在我的席上吃喝，并且坐在宝座上，审判以色列十二个支派。（路加福音<a href="http://39-27.cn/路22.29.htm">22:29</a>，<a href="http://39-27.cn/路22.30.htm">30</a>）<br />在这些经文中，所指的并不是二十四位长老，也不是十二使徒，而是总体上的全部真理与良善；这一点可从以下事实看出来：没有哪个人，甚至没有哪位天使能审判任何人；因为没有人能知道一个人的内在是什么样，或将来、直到永远是什么样，唯独主知道。至于“十二使徒”，他们和“十二支派”意思一样，即表示作为一个整体的全部真理和良善（参看<a href="2129.htm">2129</a>，<a href="2553.htm">2553</a>，<a href="3488.htm">3488</a>，<a href="3858.htm">3858</a>e节）。由此明显可知，“但审判他的民，作以色列支派之一”表示“但”所代表的真理是藉以实现审判的总体真理之一。</p>

Shall judge his people as one of the tribes of Israel. That this signifies that he is one of the truths in general which the tribes of Israel represent, is evident from the signification of "judging," 
as being truth in its office (of which below); from the signification of "people," as being those who are in truth (n. 1259, 1260, 2928, 3295, 3581, 4619), here those who are in truth and not yet in 
good, for these are "Dan" or the "people" of Dan (n. 6396); and from the representation of the "tribes of Israel," as being all the truths and goods of faith in general (see n. 3858, 3926, 3939, 4060, 
6335). Hence by "he shall judge his people as one of the tribes of Israel" is signified that this truth, represented by Dan, is also among the general truths which the tribes of Israel represent. That 
"judging his people" denotes truth in its office, is because by the tribes of Israel are represented all truths in general, as may be seen from the passages above cited, and truths are what judge; 
thus by "judging his people" is signified truth in its office. [2] We read in the Word that four and twenty elders are to sit upon thrones and judge nations and peoples; and that the twelve apostles 
are in like manner to sit upon thrones and judge the twelve tribes of Israel. He who does not know the internal sense of the Word may believe that so it will be. But how this is to be understood may be 
seen from the internal sense when it is known what is signified by the "four and twenty elders," and by the "twelve apostles," and by the "thrones," namely, all truths in their complex, according to 
what is judgment. The like is here meant by "judging the people as one of the tribes of Israel," not that they, or any elders of them, are to judge; but the truths themselves which are signified by them; 
consequently the Lord alone, for from Him all truth proceeds. Of the four and twenty elders, that they are to sit upon thrones and to judge, it is thus written in John: </p>
<p>     Around the throne were 
four and twenty thrones, and upon the thrones I saw four and twenty elders sitting, clothed in white garments, who had upon their heads crowns of gold (Rev. 4:4; 11:16). And again: </p>
<p>     I saw thrones, 
and they sat on them, and judgment was given to them (Rev. 20:4). Of the twelve apostles it is thus written in Matthew: </p>
<p>     Jesus said, Ye who have followed Me in the regeneration, when the Son 
of man shall sit upon the throne of His glory, ye also shall sit upon twelve thrones judging the twelve tribes of Israel (Matt. 19:28). And in Luke: </p>
<p>     I appoint unto you, as the Father has appointed 
unto Me a kingdom, that ye may eat and drink upon My table in My kingdom, and sit upon thrones judging the twelve tribes of Israel (Luke 17:29, 30). [3] That in these passages neither four and 
twenty elders nor twelve apostles are meant, but all truths and goods in general, is evident from the fact that no man, nor even an angel, can judge anyone; for no one but the Lord alone can know the 
interiors, what they are and what they will be, and this to eternity. (That by the "twelve apostles" the same is signified as by the "twelve tribes," namely, all truths and goods in the complex, may 
be seen above, n. 2129, 2553, 3488, 3858.) From all this it is now plain that by "Dan shall judge his people as one of the tribes of Israel" is signified that the truth which is represented by Dan is 
one among the general truths through which is judgment. </p>

<p align="center"><b>Elliott(1983-1999) 6397</b></p><p><b>6397.</b>
'Will judge his people, as one of the tribes of Israel' means that it is one of the truths in general which the tribes of Israel represent. This is clear from the meaning of 'judging' as truth exercising 
its proper function, dealt with below; from the meaning of 'people' as those governed by truth, dealt with in <a href="1259.htm">1259</a>, <a href="1260.htm">1260</a>, <a href="2928.htm">2928</a>, <a href="3295.htm">3295</a>, <a href="3581.htm">3581</a>, <a href="4619.htm">4619</a>, at this point those guided by truth but not as yet 
by good, since they are Dan, that is, the people of Dan, <a href="6396.htm">6396</a>; and from the representation of 'the tribes of Israel' as all truths and forms of good in general, dealt with in <a href="3858.htm">3858</a>, <a href="3926.htm">3926</a>, <a href="3939.htm">3939</a>, <a href="4060.htm">4060</a>, <a href="6335.htm">6335</a>. Consequently 'will judge his people, as one of the tribes of Israel' means that the truth which 'Dan' represents is one of the general truths that 'the tribes of Israel' represent. The reason why 
'judging his people' means truth exercising its proper function is that all truths in general are represented by 'the tribes of Israel', as may become clear from the paragraphs referred to above; and 
since truths are what act as judges, 'judging his people' means truth exercising its proper function. </p>
<p></p>
<p><b>[2]</b>
 In the Word one reads the description that the twenty-four elders will sit on thrones and 
judge nations and peoples, and that the twelve apostles will similarly sit on thrones and judge the twelve tribes of Israel. A person with no knowledge of the internal sense of the Word will think that 
precisely that is going to happen. But how those descriptions should be understood becomes clear when one knows from the internal sense what 'the twenty-four elders', 'the twelve apostles', and also 
'thrones' mean, namely all truths in their entirety, in accordance with which judgement is effected. The same goes for one's understanding here of 'judging his people as one of the tribes of Israel'. 
The meaning is not that these or any other elders among them will act as judges, but that the actual truths meant by them, therefore the Lord alone since every truth comes forth from Him, will do so. 
The reference to the twenty-four elders who will sit on thrones and act as judges occurs in John as follows, </p>
<blockquote>
Around the throne were twenty-four thrones, and on the thrones I saw twenty-four elders 
seated, clad in white garments, who had crowns of gold on their heads. <a href="http://bible.gospelcom.net/cgi-bin/bible?passage=Rev%204:4;%2011:16&amp;version=ESV&amp;interface=print&amp;showfn=yes&amp;showxref">Rev 4:4; 11:16</a>. 
</blockquote>
<p>In the same book, </p>
<blockquote>
I saw thrones, and they sat on them, and judgement was given to them. <a href="http://bible.gospelcom.net/cgi-bin/bible?passage=Rev%2020:4&amp;version=ESV&amp;interface=print&amp;showfn=yes&amp;showxref">Rev 20:4</a>. 
</blockquote>
<p>The 
reference to the twelve apostles occurs in Matthew, </p>
<blockquote>
Jesus said, You who have followed Me, in the regeneration, when the Son of Man sits on the throne of His glory, will also sit on twelve thrones, 
judging the twelve tribes of Israel. <a href="http://bible.gospelcom.net/cgi-bin/bible?passage=Matt%2019:28&amp;version=ESV&amp;interface=print&amp;showfn=yes&amp;showxref">Matt 19:28</a>. 
</blockquote>
<p>And in Luke, </p>
<blockquote>
I bestow on you, just as My father bestowed on Me, a kingdom, that you may eat and drink at My table in My kingdom, and sit on thrones, 
judging the twelve tribes of Israel. <a href="http://bible.gospelcom.net/cgi-bin/bible?passage=Luke%2021:29,%2030&amp;version=ESV&amp;interface=print&amp;showfn=yes&amp;showxref">Luke 21:29, 30</a>. 
</blockquote>
<p>Here neither the twenty-four elders nor the twelve apostles are what are really meant but all truths and forms of good in general, as may 
be recognized from the consideration that nobody, not even any angel, can judge anyone; for no one except the Lord alone can know what a person is or ever will be like interiorly. With regard to the 
twelve apostles, that they had a similar meaning to the twelve tribes, which was all truths and forms of good in their entirety, see <a href="2129.htm">2129</a>, <a href="2553.htm">2553</a>, <a href="3488.htm">3488</a>, <a href="3858.htm">3858</a> (end). From all this it is now evident that 
'Dan will judge his people, as one of the tribes of Israel' means that the truth represented by 'Dan' is one of the general truths by means of which judgement is effected. </p>

`Judicabit populum suum sicut una tribuum Israelis': quod significet quod unum sit ex veris in communi quae repraesentant tribus Israelis, constat ex significatione `judicare' quod sit verum in suo 
officio, de qua sequitur; ex significatione `populi' quod sint illi qui in vero sunt, de qua n. 1259, 1260, 2928, 3295, 3581, 4619; hic illi qui in vero sunt et nondum in bono, {1}nam sunt illi `Dan' 
seu `populus Danis', {2} n. 6396; ex repraesentatione `tribuum Israelis' quod sint omnia (t)vera et bona fidei in communi, de qua n. 3858, 3926, 3939, 4060, 6335, inde per `judicabit populum {3} sicut 
una tribuum Israelis' significatur quod verum hoc quod per `Danem' repraesentatur, sit {4}unum inter vera communia quae repraesentant tribus Israelis:  Quod `judicare populum suum' sit verum in suo officio, 
est quia per `tribus Israelis' repraesentantur omnia vera in communi, ut ex locis supra {5}citatis constare potest; et vera sunt quae judicant, ita per `judicare populum suum' significatur verum 
in suo officio.  [2] In Verbo legitur quod `viginti quatuor seniores sessuri sint super thronis, et judicaturi gentes et populos'; {6}et quod duodecim apostoli similiter sessuri sint super thronis, 
et judicaturi duodecim tribus Israelis'; qui non sensum internum Verbi novit, credet quod ita fiet, at quomodo id intelligendum, constare potest cum ex sensu interno scitur quid significant `viginti 
quatuor seniores', et quid `duodecim apostoli', {7}tum quid `throni', quod nempe omnia vera in suo complexu secundum quae judicium; {8}similiter intelligitur hic per `judicare populum sicut una tribuum 
Israelis', non quod illi aut aliqui seniores (c)illorum judicaturi sint, sed quod ipsa vera quae per (c)illos significantur proinde Dominus solus, nam ab Ipso omne verum procedit.  De viginti quatuor 
senioribus quod sessuri super thronis et judicaturi, ita apud Johannem, Circa thronum erant throni viginti et quatuor, et super thronis  vidi viginti et quatuor seniores sedentes, indutos vestimentis 
albis, qui habebant super capitibus suis coronas aureas, Apoc. iv 4, xi i 16; </p>
<p>et apud eundem, Vidi thronos, et consederunt super illis, et judicium datum  est illis, Apoc. xx 4: </p>
<p>de duodecim apostolis 
apud Matthaeum, Jesus dixit, Vos qui secuti estis Me in regeneratione, quando sedebit Filius hominis super throno gloriae Suae, sedebitis etiam vos super duodecim thronis judicantes duodecim tribus 
Israelis, xix 28: </p>
<p>et apud Lucam, Ego dispono vobis, sicut disposuit Pater Mihi regnum, ut  comedatis et bibatis super mensa Mea in regno Meo; et sedeatis super thronis judicantes duodecim tribus 
Israelis, xxii [29,] 30; </p>
<p>[3] quod (t)hic non viginti quatuor seniores nec duodecim apostoli {9}intelligantur, sed omnia vera et bona in communi, constare potest ex eo quod nullus homo, ne quidem aliquis 
angelus, possit aliquem judicare; interiora enim qualia sunt et qualia erunt, et hoc in aeternum, nemo scire potest quam solus Dominus; quod per `duodecim apostolos' similia ac per `duodecim tribus' 
significata sint, nempe omnia vera et bona in complexu, videatur n. 2129, 2553, 3488, 3858 fin.  Ex his nunc patet quod per `Dan judicabit populum suum sicut una tribuum Israelis' significetur quod 
verum quod repraesentatur per `Danem', sit unum inter vera {10}communia, per quae judicium. @1 sunt enim$ @2 i de qua mox supra$ @3 i suum$ @4 etiam I, but see end of number$ @5 alligatis$ @6
