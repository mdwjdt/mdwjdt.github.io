<h3 align="center" class="ired">属天的奥秘 第956节</h3>
<h4 align="center"></h4><p><strong>956.</strong>人若热衷于报复，觉得自己比谁都伟大，与自己相比，其他人一文不值，就会以下面的方式遭受分解的惩罚：他们的脸和身体被损毁，直到几乎不成人形。脸变得象宽圆饼，胳膊看似破布，由于胳膊被拉伸，所以其中一个人在高处旋转起来，并且一直朝天上旋转，而他的秉性也被公之于众，直到羞耻感刺透他，直刺及核心。在这种情况下，作为一个哀求者，他被迫照着指示给他的说法乞求宽恕。之后，他被带到一个烂淤泥塘，就在污秽的耶路撒冷附近，然后一头扎进去，在里面滚来滚去，直到变成淤泥的样子。这一切会重复数次，直到这种报复的欲望被除去。在这个烂泥塘里有一些属于膀胱区域的恶毒女人。</p>

<p><strong>[NCE]956.</strong> Some people are tenaciously vindictive and consider themselves more important than anyone else, judging all others worthless compared to themselves. Their punishment is to be humiliated, and this is what it is like: Their bodies and faces are disfigured, so that there is hardly anything human-looking left of them. Their faces end up looking like big rounds of flatbread; their arms, like rags. With these stretched out, they spin around, high in the air, always rising toward heaven, and someone shouts out a description of their character for all to hear. Eventually they are struck to the depths with shame. So they are driven to beg humbly for mercy, and the words are dictated to them. Afterward they are taken to a pool of muck near the foul Jerusalem{*1} and are rolled and dipped in it until they look as though they have turned into mud. They go through this process several times, until they lose all desire for vengeance and superiority.<br />In the pool of muck are malicious women from the area of the bladder.{*2} <br /><strong>Footnotes:</strong><br />{*1} The foul Jerusalem is described in <a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_956/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_940" target=_top>940</a>. [LHC]<br />{*2} The idea that these women inhabit the area of the bladder can be understood in light of Swedenborg's claim that heaven exists in the form of a human being, on which see note 2 in <a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_956/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_947" target=_top>947</a>. Compare also <a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_956/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_4223" target=_top>4223</a>, where Swedenborg says that spirits are said to belong to a region of the body because of their correspondence with the function of that particular organ. (On correspondence, see note 1 in <a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_956/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_276" target=_top>276</a>.) Spirits who form the bladder and other excretory organs like to probe and punish other spirits, while spirits to whom the actual waste matter corresponds are on their way to hell; see <a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_956/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_5380" target=_top>5380-5381</a>.

<p align="center"><b>Potts(1905-1910) 956</b></p><p><b>956.</b>
Those who are tenacious of revenge and who think themselves greater than all others, regarding them as of no account in comparison with themselves, suffer the punishment of laceration in the following 
manner: They are mangled in face and body until there is scarcely anything human left; the face becomes like a broad round cake, the arms look like rags, and these being stretched out, the man is whirled 
around on high and all the time toward heaven, while his character is proclaimed in the presence of all until shame penetrates him to the inmost. Thus, a suppliant, he is compelled to beg for pardon 
in terms that are dictated to him. Afterwards he is carried to a miry lake, which is near the filthy Jerusalem, and is plunged and rolled in it till he becomes a figure of mud; and this is done repeatedly, 
until such cupidity is taken away. In this miry lake there are malicious women belonging to the province of the bladder. </p>

<p align="center"><b>Elliott(1983-1999) 956</b></p><p><b>956.</b>
For those who are bent on revenge and who imagine they are superior to everybody else, rating all others as worthless in contrast to themselves, the punishment is that of being lacerated, as follows: 
They are disfigured in face and body until scarcely anything human remains to be seen. The face comes to be like a wide round cake. The arms look like rags; and with these stretched out, the one to whom 
they belong is whirled around on high, all the time upwards into the sky, while his character is declared in the presence of all, until shame seizes him to the core. In this condition, now a suppliant, 
he is compelled to plead for deliverance, and in terms dictated to him. After that he is taken away to the muddy stagnant pond near the filthy Jerusalem, in which he is rolled and plunged to become 
a picture of mud. And this is repeated several times until such desire for revenge is removed. In this muddy pond there are noxious women from the province of the bladder. </p>

</p><b>956.</b>
Qui vindictae tenaces sunt et qui omnibus aliis se majores putant, ceteros reputantes pro nihilo respective ad se, iis poena lacerationis est, quae talis; foedantur corpore et facie ut vix appareat 
aliquid humanum residuum; facies fit sicut placenta rotunda, lata; brachia apparent sicut panni, quibus extensis rotatur in alto jugiter versus caelum, et clamatur coram omnibus quod talis sit, usque 
ut pudor perstringat intima; ita supplex adigitur ad deprecandum et dictatur ei; postea fertur in stagnum luteum quod est prope Hierosolymam spurcam, et ibi volvitur et immergitur ut fiat instar caeni; 
et hoc fit aliquoties usque dum talis cupiditas auferatur. In stagno hoc luteo, sunt feminae malignae e provincia 'vesicae urinatoriae.' </p>
