<h3 align="center" class="ired">属天的奥秘 第7118节</h3>
<h4 align="center"></h4><p><strong>7118.</strong>“因为他们是懒惰的”表因为他们没有受到足够的攻击。这从“懒惰”的含义清楚可知，“懒惰”是指没有受到虚假足够的侵扰，因而没有受到足够的攻击。此中情形从来世那些被虚假侵扰的人也能得知。那些进行侵扰的人尽可能地阻止他们所侵扰的正直人思想主；一旦有明显与主有关的思维出现，他们就立刻除去它，他们知道如何巧妙地做到这一点。但对那些被侵扰的人来说，关于主的思维仍是包罗万象的，因而太过内在，以至于显露不出来，因为它通过天堂流入。因此，这些人一停止侵扰，他们就进入关于主的思维。因为从天堂流入并普遍占主导的东西会在一切自由状态下揭示自己。由此可见这些话的内义是什么，即：“因为他们是懒惰的，所以呼求说，容我们去祭祀我们的神”。</p>

For they are idle. That this signifies that they are not assaulted enough, is evident from the signification of "being idle," as being not to be sufficiently infested by falsities, thus not to be assaulted 
enough. How the case herein is can also be known from those who are being infested by falsities in the other life. They who infest, as far as possible hinder the upright whom they infest from thinking 
about the Lord; as soon as any thought of the Lord openly occurs, they at once take it away, which they know how to do in a skillful manner. But as with those who are being infested, thought about 
the Lord is nevertheless universal, thus too interior to be in plain view (for it flows in through heaven), therefore as soon as they cease to be infested, they come into thought about the Lord, 
for that which flows in from heaven and reigns universally, reveals itself in every free state. From all this it is evident what is the internal sense of the words "for they are idle, therefore they cry, 
saying Let us go and sacrifice to our God." </p>

<p align="center"><b>Elliott(1983-1999) 7118</b></p><p><b>7118.</b>
'For they are slack' means because they have not been sufficiently assaulted. This is clear from the meaning of 'their being slack' as their not being molested sufficiently by falsities, thus not assaulted 
sufficiently. The nature of this may also be recognized from those who are molested by falsities in the next life. So far as they can, those who molest prevent the upright whom they molest from 
thinking about the Lord. As soon as any thought at all which has to do plainly with the Lord presents itself they instantly remove it, which they know how to do cleverly. But thought about the Lord which 
is present with those who are molested is nevertheless all-embracing, since it flows in by way of heaven, and so is too internal to be exposed to view. And as soon as these people cease to be molested 
they therefore enter into thought about the Lord. For what flows in from heaven and reigns universally reveals itself wherever people are in freedom. From all this one may see what the internal 
sense of these words is - of the words, For they are slack; therefore they cry out, saying, Let us go, let us sacrifice to our God. </p>

</p><b>7118.</b>
`Quia remissi illi quod significet quia non satis oppugnati, constat ex significatione `esse remissos' quod (d)sit non satis infestatos esse a falsis, ita non satis oppugnatos.  (s)Quomodo hoc se habet, 
etiam ab illis qui infestantur a falsis in altera vita sciri potest: qui infestant, quantum possunt, inhibent, ne probi quos infestant cogitent de Domino; ut primum aliquid cogitationis aperte de 
Domino incidit, ilico auferunt, quod dextre facere sciunt; sed quia cogitatio de Domino apud illos qui infestantur usque universalis est, ita interior quam ut pateat, nam per caelum influit, {1}ideo, 
ut primum non infestantur in cogitationem de Domino veniunt; quod enim e caelo influit et universaliter regnat, hoc se revelat in omni libero; ex his patet quis horum verborum, nempe `quia remissi illi, 
propterea illi clamant, dicendo, Eamus, sacrificemus Deo nostro' sensus internus est.(s) 	@1 quare$ </p>
