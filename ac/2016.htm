<h3 align="center" class="ired">属天的奥秘 第2016节</h3>
<h4 align="center"></h4><p><strong>2016.</strong>主是一切良善的源头，并由此是一切真理的源头，这是一个永恒的真理。天使凭直觉看到它，并且如此清晰，以致他们发觉，凡源于主的都是善与真，凡源于他们自己的都是恶与假。他们也会在新到那里的灵魂和怀疑它的灵人面前坦承这一真理。他们甚至声称，正是主使他们退离由其自我所产生的恶与假，并将他们保守在善与真中。而且，对他们来说，这种从其恶与假的实际退离并主及善与真的实际流注是可察觉的（参看<a href="1614.htm">1614</a>节）。至于人以为他凭自己行善，凭自己思考真理，这是一个表象。因为人处于没有觉察的状态，对于流注则处在巨大的模糊中。因此，他通过表象，甚至幻觉推论出这一点。只要他只相信感官和由此而来的推理，无论事实是否如此，出于这种表象或幻觉，他决不会让自己退离。不过，尽管表象是这样，但人仍应貌似凭自己行善、思考真理，因为他无法以其它方式被改造和重生。至于原因，可参看前文（<a href="1937.htm">1937</a>，<a href="1947.htm">1947</a>节）。<br />本节论述的主题是主联结于神性本质的人性本质，以及一切善与真相应地从祂的神性本质经由祂的人性本质来到人这里。这是一个神圣奥秘，很少有人相信，因为他们不理解。事实上，他们以为神性良善能抵达人这里，无需主联结于神性的人性。但这是不可能的，这在前面已予以简要说明（<a href="1676.htm">1676</a>，<a href="1990.htm">1990</a>节），大意是：人因所沉迷的恶欲和使他盲目的虚假而远离了至高无上的神性，以致神性除了经由主在自己里面联结于神性的人性外，无法流入其心智的理性部分。联系是通过祂的人性得以实现的，因为至高无上的神性以这种方式才能来到人这里，如主在很多地方公开声明的。祂说，祂就是“道路”，“若不藉着祂，没人能到父那里去”。这就是此处所论述的，即祂，也就是说，联结于神性的人性就是一切良善和一切真理的源头。</p>

As regards the fact that all good and the derivative truth are from the Lord: this is a constant verity. The angels are in the perception of it to such a degree that they perceive that insofar as anything 
is from the Lord, it is good and true, and that insofar as it is from themselves, it is evil and false. They also confess this before novitiate souls, and before spirits who are in doubt of it, 
nay, they go so far as to say that it is by the Lord that they are withheld from the evil and falsity that come from what is their own, and are kept in good and truth. Moreover the very withholding and 
the very influx are perceptible to them (see n. 1614). But as to man's supposing that he does good from himself and thinks truth from himself, this is an appearance, because he is in a state of no perception, 
and in a state of the greatest obscurity in respect to influx; and therefore he infers this from the appearance, nay, from the fallacy, from which he by no means suffers himself to be withdrawn 
so long as he has belief in nothing but the senses, and so long as he reasons from them whether it be so. But although the case is as stated, man nevertheless ought to do good and to think truth 
as from himself; for in no other way can he be reformed and regenerated (the reason of which may be seen above, n. 1937, 1947).  [2] The verse now before us treats of the Lord's Human Essence that was 
to be united to the Divine Essence; and that all good and truth would thereby come to man from His Divine Essence through His Human Essence, is a Divine arcanum which few believe, because they do not 
apprehend it, for they suppose that the Divine good is able to reach to man without the Lord's Human united to the Divine; but that this cannot be done, has been already shown in a few words (n. 1676, 
1990), to this effect, that man has removed himself so far from the Supreme Divine, by the cupidities in which he has immersed himself and by the falsities with which he has blinded himself, that there 
could not possibly be any influx of the Divine into the rational part of his mind except through the Human which the Lord united in Himself to the Divine. Through His Human, communication has been 
effected; for thereby the Supreme Divine has been able to come to man. This the Lord says openly in many places, for He says that He is "the way," and that "no one cometh to the Father but by Him." 
This then is what is here affirmed: that from Him, namely, from the Human united to the Divine, is all good and all truth. </p>

To say that the Lord is the source of all good, and from this of all truth, is to express an unchanging truth. Angels see this truth with perception, so clearly that they perceive that insofar as anything 
is derived from the Lord it is good and true, and insofar as anything is derived from themselves it is evil and false. They also confess this truth before souls newly arrived there, and before spirits 
who are in doubt about it; indeed, they go so far as to declare that they are withheld by the Lord from evil and falsity which arise from their proprium and are kept by Him in good and truth. The 
actual withholding from their evil and falsity and the actual entrance of the Lord with good and truth is also perceptible to them; see <a href="1614.htm">1614</a>. But as to man's imagining that he does what is good from 
himself and thinks what is true from himself, this is an appearance due to his state being a state in which no perception is present and in which very great obscurity exists where influx is concerned. 
What he thinks therefore is based on that appearance, indeed on a delusion, from which he never allows himself to be removed so long as he believes nothing but the senses and reasons from these whether 
the thing is so. But although the appearance is such, man ought nevertheless to do what is good and to think what is true as from himself, for in no other way can he be reformed and regenerated. 
For the reason why, see <a href="1937.htm">1937</a>, <a href="1947.htm">1947</a>. </p>
<p></p>
<p><b>[2]</b>
 The subject in this verse is the Lord's Human Essence that was to be united to the Divine Essence, also that all good and truth would accordingly come to man 
from the Divine Essence by way of His Human Essence. This is a Divine arcanum which few believe because they cannot grasp it mentally. Indeed they imagine that Divine Good can reach out to man independently 
of the Lord's Human united to the Divine. But the reason it cannot do so has already been shown briefly in <a href="1676.htm">1676</a>, <a href="1990.htm">1990</a> - that through the evil desires in which he had immersed himself and through 
the falsities with which he had blinded himself man had moved himself so far away from the Supreme Divine that no influx of the Divine into the rational part of his mind was possible, except by way 
of the Human which the Lord united in Himself to the Divine. It was through His Human that communication was established, for in that way the Supreme Divine was able to come to man, as the Lord explicitly 
states in many places, that is to say, where He says that He is the way and that there is no other access to the Father except through Him. This then is what is being stated here - that He, that 
is to say, the Human united to the Divine, is the source of all good and of all truth. </p>

Quod ad rem attinet, quod {1} a Domino omne bonum et inde verum, est constans veritas; angeli in illius perceptione sunt, adeo ut percipiant quantum a Domino quod sit bonum et verum, et quantum a semet 
quod sit malum et falsum; etiam confitentur illud coram animabus novitiis, et coram spiritibus, qui dubitant, immo adhuc plus quod detineantur a malo et falso quod {2} ex proprio eorum, et (o)quod 
teneantur in bono et vero, a Domino; ipsa detentio et ipse influxus etiam illis perceptibilis est, videatur n. 1614: at quod homo putet se bonum ex se facere et verum ex se cogitare, est apparentia, 
quia in statu nullius perceptionis est et in obscurissimo quoad influxum, quare ex apparentia, immo (c)ex fallacia concludit, a qua nusquam removeri se patitur quamdiu non credit nisi sensibus et quamdiu 
inde ratiocinatur num ita sit.  Sed tametsi ita est, usque tamen debet homo facere bonum et cogitare veram ut a se, nam aliter non reformari et regenerari potest; causa cur ita, videatur n. 1937, 
1947.  [2] In hoc versu agitur de Humana Domini Essentia unienda Divinae, et quod omne bonum et verum sic a Divina Essentia per Ipsius Humanam ad hominem veniret, est arcanum Divinum quod pauci credunt 
quia non capiunt; putant enim Divinum Bonum posse ad hominem pertingere absque Humano Domini unito Divino, sed quod hoc fieri nequeat, paucis ostensum prius n. 1676, 1990; nempe, quod homo se tantum 
removerit a Divino Supremo per cupiditates quibus se immersit et per falsitates quibus se occaecavit, ut nusquam fuisset aliquis influxus Divini in rationale ejus mentis nisi per Humanum quod Dominus 
in Se uniret Divino; per Humanum Ipsius facta est communicatio; sic enim Supremum Divinum venire potuit ad hominem, quod Dominus aperte pluribus in locis dicit, nempe quod Ipse sit via; et quod ad Patrem 
non aditus sit quam per Ipsum; hoc {3} nunc est quod hic dicitur, quod ab Ipso, nempe Humano unito Divino, omne bonum et omne verum. 	@1 nempe.$ 	@2 i est.$ 	@3 inde.$ </p>
