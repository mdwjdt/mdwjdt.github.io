<h3 align="center" class="ired">属天的奥秘 第2153节</h3>
<h4 align="center"></h4><p><strong>2153.</strong>“俯伏在地”表出于随之而来的喜悦的谦卑表现。这从“俯伏在地”的意义清楚可知，“俯伏在地”是谦卑的表现。由于一切内在情感都有相应的外在举止或身体活动（这些举止是情感的结果，而情感则是产生它们的原因），故谦卑的行为就是下拜和俯伏在地。显然，俯伏在地是喜悦的结果，因为如前所述，祂意识到这种直觉来自神性。主处于人身时的谦卑状态早已在各处予以论述，蒙主怜悯，在本章还会进一步予以论述。</p>

And bowed himself toward the earth. That this signifies the effect of the humiliation from the consequent joy, is evident from the signification of "bowing himself," as being to humble. Just as all interior 
affections have gestures corresponding to them in outward or bodily motions, which gestures are the effects of the affections as their effecting causes, so the action of humbling oneself has humiliation 
and also prostration. That this prostration was from joy is evident, because He observed, as before said, the perception to be from the Divine. The state of the Lord's humiliation when He was 
in the Human, has already been treated of in various places, and of the Lord's Divine mercy shall be further treated of in this chapter. </p>

'And he bowed down towards the ground' means the expression of humility from the resulting joy. This is clear from the meaning of 'bowing down' as expressing humility. Insofar as all interior affections 
have corresponding gestures within external or bodily activity - gestures which are expressions of affections as their own efficient causes, the affection belonging to humility has the corresponding 
gesture of bowing down<A name="fntext1"></a><A href="#fn1"><sup>a</sup></a> and also that of prostration. This gesture was clearly a product of joy, for as has been stated, He recognized the perception to be from the Divine. 'The Lord's state of humiliation 
when He was in the Human has been referred to in various places already, and in the Lord's Divine mercy is to be referred to further in the present chapter.

word which means humiliation, but in his rough draft Sw. has a word which means a bowing down. </p>

</p><b>2153.</b>
`Et incurvavit se versus terram': quod significet effectum humiliationis ex gaudio inde, constat ex significatione `incurvare se' quod sit humiliare; sicut omnes affectiones interiores correspondenti 
sibi gestus habent in externis, seu in corporeis, qui gestus sunt effectus affectionum ut suarum causarum efficientium, ita affectio humiliationis habet humiliationem, ut et prostrationem; quod hoc 
{1} fuerit ex gaudio, constat, quia appercepit, ut dictum {2}, perceptionem ex Divino.  De statu humiliationis Domini cum fuit in Humano, passim prius actum est, et in sequentibus hujus capitis, ex Divina 
Domini Misericordi agendum. 	@1 hic.$ 	@2 i est.$ </p>
