<h3 align="center" class="ired">属天的奥秘 第1530节</h3>
<h4 align="center"></h4><p><strong>1530.</strong>这一事实通过圣言可证明给所有人，如当主显现给彼得、雅各和约翰时，因为那时祂脸面明亮如日头，衣裳洁白如光（马太福音<a href="http://39-27.cn/太17.2.htm">17:2</a>）。祂以这样的方式向他们显现，唯一的原因是，他们的内在视觉已被打开。先知书同样证实了这一点，如以赛亚书中论及主在天堂的王国时说：<br />月光必像日光，日光必加七倍，像七日的光一样。（以赛亚书<a href="http://39-27.cn/赛30.26.htm">30:26</a>）<br />启示录中论及被称为新耶路撒冷的主的国度时说：<br />那城内又不用日月光照，因有神的荣耀光照，又有羔羊为城的灯。（启示录<a href="http://39-27.cn/启21.23.htm">21:23</a>）<br /><br />不再有黑夜，他们也不用灯光、日光，因为主神要光照他们。（启示录<a href="http://39-27.cn/启22.5.htm">22:5</a>）<br />此外，当主显现给摩西、亚伦、拿答、亚比户，并七十个长老时，经上说“他们看见以色列的神，祂脚下仿佛有平铺的蓝宝石，明净如天”（出埃及记<a href="http://39-27.cn/出24.10.htm">24:10</a>）。由于主的属天、属灵之物在天使的外在视觉前显为太阳和月亮，故在圣言中，“太阳或日头”表属天之物，“月亮”则表属灵之物。</p><br />

<p><strong>[NCE]1530.</strong> Anyone could have seen the truth of this from the Word 钬?for instance, from the time when the Lord revealed himself to Peter, James, and John, since his face then shone like the sun and his clothes became like the light (<a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_1530/bible_king-james-version_matthew_17_2" target=_top>Matthew 17:2</a>). The only reason he appeared this way to them was that their inner eyes were open.<br />The prophets provide evidence for the same thing. In Isaiah, for example, where it deals with the Lord's kingdom in the heavens:<br />The light of the moon will be like the light of the sun, and the light of the sun will be seven times as strong, like the light of seven days. (<a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_1530/bible_king-james-version_isaiah_30_26" target=_top>Isaiah 30:26</a>)<br />And in a passage from John also dealing with the Lord's kingdom, which is called the New Jerusalem:<br />The city has no need for the sun or the moon to shine in it, since God's glory lights it and its lamp is the Lamb. (<a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_1530/bible_king-james-version_revelation_21_23" target=_top>Revelation 21:23</a>)<br />In another place as well:<br />Night will not exist there, and they will have no need for a lamp or sunlight, because the Lord God gives them light. (<a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_1530/bible_king-james-version_revelation_22_5" target=_top>Revelation 22:5</a>)<br />Additionally, when the Lord appeared to Moses, Aaron, Nadab, Abihu, and the seventy elders,<br />They saw the God of Israel, under whose feet was something like a work of sapphire stone, and it looked like the substance of the sky for cleanness. (<a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_1530/bible_king-james-version_exodus_24_10" target=_top>Exodus 24:10</a>)<br />Since the Lord's heavenly, spiritual quality appears to angels' outward sight as a sun or moon, the sun in the Word symbolizes something heavenly; the moon, something spiritual. </p>
<p align="center"><b>Potts(1905-1910) 1530</b></p><p><b>1530.</b>
That this is so the Word has shown to all; as when the Lord was made manifest to Peter, James, and John; for His face then shone as the sun, and His garments became as the light (Matt. 17:2). He so appeared 
to them simply because their interior sight was opened. The same is confirmed also in the Prophets; as in Isaiah, where the Lord's kingdom in the heavens is treated of: </p>
<p>     The light of the 
moon shall be as the light of the sun, and the light of the sun shall be sevenfold, as the light of seven days (Isa. 30:26). And in John, where also the Lord's kingdom, which is called the New Jerusalem, 
is spoken of: </p>
<p>     The city hath no need of the sun, neither of the moon, to shine in it; for the glory of God doth lighten it, and the Lamb is the lamp thereof (Rev. 21:23). And again: </p>
<p>     There 
shall be no night there, and they have no need of a lamp, neither light of the sun, for the Lord God giveth them light (Rev. 22:5). Besides that when the Lord appeared to Moses, Aaron, Nadab, Abihu, 
and the seventy elders,       they saw the God of Israel, under whose feet was as it were a work of sapphire stone, and as it were the substance of heaven in clearness (Exod. 24:10). As the Lord's 
celestial and spiritual appear before the external sight of the angels as a Sun and a Moon, therefore "the sun" in the Word signifies what is celestial, and "the moon" what is spiritual. </p>

<p align="center"><b>Elliott(1983-1999) 1530</b></p><p><b>1530.</b>
The truth of this could be proved to anyone from the Word, for example, when the Lord revealed Himself to Peter, James, and John, for His face at that time shone like the sun and His garments became 
white as the light, <a href="http://bible.gospelcom.net/cgi-bin/bible?passage=Matt%2017:2&amp;version=ESV&amp;interface=print&amp;showfn=yes&amp;showxref">Matt 17:2</a>. The sole reason why He appeared to them in this way was that their interior sight had been opened The same is also confirmed from the Prophets, as in Isaiah when reference 
is being made to the Lord's kingdom in heaven, </p>
<blockquote>
The light of the moon will be as the light of the sun, and the light of the sun will be sevenfold, as the light of seven days. <a href="http://bible.gospelcom.net/cgi-bin/bible?passage=Isa%2030:26&amp;version=ESV&amp;interface=print&amp;showfn=yes&amp;showxref">Isa 30:26</a>. 
</blockquote>
<p>And in 
John, where reference is being made to the Lord's kingdom which is called the New Jerusalem, </p>
<blockquote>
The city has no need of the sun or of the moon to shed light in it; for the glory of God gives it light, 
and its lamp is the Lamb. <a href="http://bible.gospelcom.net/cgi-bin/bible?passage=Rev%2021:23&amp;version=ESV&amp;interface=print&amp;showfn=yes&amp;showxref">Rev 21:23</a>. 
</blockquote>
<p>And elsewhere in the same book, </p>
<blockquote>
There will be no night there, nor do they need a lamp or light of the sun, for the Lord God gives them light. <a href="http://bible.gospelcom.net/cgi-bin/bible?passage=Rev%2022:5&amp;version=ESV&amp;interface=print&amp;showfn=yes&amp;showxref">Rev 22:5</a>. 
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
And 
in addition when the Lord appeared to Moses, Aaron, Nadab, Abihu, and the seventy elders, it is said that they saw the God of Israel under whose feet there was so to speak a paved work of sapphire 
stone, like the substance of the sky for clearness, <a href="http://bible.gospelcom.net/cgi-bin/bible?passage=Exod%2024:10&amp;version=ESV&amp;interface=print&amp;showfn=yes&amp;showxref">Exod 24:10</a>. 
</blockquote>
Because the Lord's celestial and spiritual appears before the external sight of the angels as the Sun and the Moon, 'the sun' in the Word 
therefore means what is celestial, and 'the moon' what is spiritual. </p>

Quod ita sit, constare etiam potuit unicuique ex Verbo, ut cum Dominus manifestatus est Petro, Jacobo et Johanni, nam tunc splenduit facies Ipsius sicut sol, et vestimenta Ipsius facta sicut lux, Matth. 
xvii 2; quod illis ita apparuerit, fuit modo quia visus eorum interior apertus est. Apud Prophetas idem quoque confirmatur, ut apud Esaiam, ubi de regno Domini in caelis agitur, Erit lux lunae sicut 
lux solis, et lux solis erit septupla, sicut lux septem dierum, xxx 26: </p>
<p>et apud Johannem, ubi etiam de regno Domini quod appellatur Nova Hierosolyma, Civitas non opus habet sole, neque luna, ut 
luceant in illa; gloria enim Dei illustrat (x)illam, et lucerna illius Agnus, Apoc. xxi 23: </p>
<p>et alibi, Nox non erit ibi, neque opus habent lucerna, et luce solis, quia Dominus Deus illustrat illos, 
Apoc xxii 5: </p>
<p>praeter cum Dominus apparuit Mosi, Aharoni, Nadab, Abihu, et septuaginta senioribus, Quod viderint Deum Israelis, sub Cujus pedibus erat quasi opus lapidis sapphiri, et quasi substantia 
caeli quoad munditiem, [Exod.] xxiv 10. Quia Domini caeleste et spirituale coram visu angelorum externo apparet ut Sol et Luna, inde est quod 'sol' in Verbo significet caeleste, et 'luna' spirituale. </p>
