<h3 align="center" class="ired">属天的奥秘 第10484节</h3>
<h4 align="center"></h4><p><strong>10484</strong>.“说，凡属耶和华的，都到我这里来”表那些关心源于内在之物的外在事物之人。这从“摩西”的代表清楚可知，“摩西”是指内在（参看<a href="10468.htm">10468</a>节）。由于人的内在居于天堂，他的外在居于世界，天堂经由内在进入一个人的外在，故显而易见，“凡属耶和华的”是指那些关心源于内在之物的外在事物的人。当说到天堂进入时，意思是说主进入，因为主的神性构成天堂。所指的是这些人，这一点也可从以下事实明显看出来：他们反对那些兴趣在于与内在之物分离的外在事物的人。这一点从以下考虑进一步明显看出来：聚集到摩西那里的利未人代表那些拥有源于良善的真理之人；那些拥有源于良善的真理之人关心源于内在之物的外在事物。</p>

And said, Who is for Jehovah? Come unto me. That this signifies those who are in external things from what is internal, is evident from the representation of Moses, as being the internal (see n. 10468). 
And whereas the internal of man is in heaven, and his external is in the world; and heaven enters with man through the internal into the external, it is evident that by "those who are for Jehovah" 
are meant those who are in external things from what is internal. When it is said that heaven enters, the meaning is that the Lord enters, because the Divine of the Lord makes heaven. That these are 
signified is evident also from the fact that these are here opposed to those who are in external things separate from what is internal; and also that by the sons of Levi who were gathered together unto 
Moses are represented those who are in truths from good; and those who are in truths from good are in external things from what is internal. </p>

'And said, Whoever is for Jehovah, [come] to me' means those whose concern for external things springs from what is internal. This is clear from the representation of 'Moses' as the internal, dealt with 
in <a href="10468.htm">10468</a>; and since a person's internal resides in heaven and his external in the world, and heaven comes into a person's external by way of the internal, it is evident that by 'those who are for 
Jehovah' those people whose concern for external things springs from what is internal should be understood. When it is said that heaven comes in, the Lord's doing so should be understood, because that 
which is Divine and the Lord's constitutes heaven. It is also evident that these people are meant from the consideration that they are opposed to those whose interest lies in external things separated 
from what is internal. It is further evident from the consideration that the sons of Levi who gathered themselves to Moses represent those who are in possession of truths springing from good; and with 
those in possession of truths springing from good the concern for external things springs from what is internal.  </p>

`Et dixit, Quis Jehovae, ad me': quod significet qui in externis sunt ab interno, constat ex repraesentatione `Moschis' quod sit internum, de qua n. 10,468; et quia internum hominis est in caelo, ac 
externum ejus in mundo, ac caelum intrat per internum in externum apud hominem, patet quod per illos qui Jehovae intelligantur qui in externis ex interno; cum dicitur quod caelum intret, intelligitur 
quod Dominus, quoniam Divinum Domini facit caelum {1}; quod illi {2} significentur, patet etiam ex eo quod opponantur illis qui in externis sunt separatis ab {3} interno; et quoque quod per filios Levi, 
qui ad Moschen congregati sunt, repraesententur illi qui in veris sunt ex bono; et qui in veris sunt ex bono, in externis ab interno sunt. @1 et quod qui in externis sunt ex interno, sint Jehovae, 
nam ut supra aliquoties ostensum est, internum hominis est in coelo, ac externum ejus est in mundo, ac coelum intrat per internum in externum apud hominem: cum dicitur quod coelum intret, intelligitur 
quod Dominus, quoniam Divinum Domini facit coelum; inde patet, quod per illos qui Jehovae, intelligantur qui in externis ex interno sunt$ @2 hi$ @3 absque$ </p>
