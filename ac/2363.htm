<h3 align="center" class="ired">属天的奥秘 第2363节</h3>
<h4 align="center"></h4><p><strong>2363.</strong>“容我领她们出来给你们”表由此而来，即由对善与真的情感而来的幸福。这从这些话在论及此处“女儿”所表示的情感时的含义清楚可知。至于这些话所包含的真实事物，也就是幸福快乐存在于对善与真的情感中这一真相，沉浸于邪恶及其快乐中的人完全不知道。在他们眼里，对善与真的情感中所存在的幸福要么表现为某种不存在的东西，要么表现为某种沉闷乏味的事物。而有些人则视它为某种痛苦、甚至致命之物。这就是地狱中的魔鬼和恶灵的情形。他们认为并相信，若我欲和物欲的快乐，以及随之由这些欲望所产生的邪恶快乐被拿走，他们便毫无生命可言。当向他们说明，真正的生活及其幸福快乐随后就会开始时，他们因丧失自己的快乐而感到悲伤。当把他们带到过着这种生活的人当中时，痛苦和折磨就紧紧抓住他们。另外，他们同时还开始从内心感到某种象死亡一样、可怕的地狱般的东西。因此，他们将天堂，也就是幸福快乐所在的地方，视为他们的地狱，并逃离，以便竭尽所能地从主面前移开并藏起来。<br />然而，一切幸福快乐就在于对从爱与仁所流出的良善和构成信的真理的情感中，只要后者，即这真理通向前者，即那良善。这一点从以下事实可以看出来：即天使的生活就在于这种幸福，它从至内在感染那些接受它的人。因为它从主经由至内在流入进来（参看<a href="540.htm">540</a>，<a href="541.htm">541</a>，<a href="545.htm">545</a>节）。这时，聪明智慧也会进入并充满内心最深处，以天堂之火点燃良善，以天堂之光点亮真理。这一过程伴随着对幸福快乐的感知，这种幸福快乐无法言传，只能称之为难以形容。凡进入这种状态的人会发觉那些臣服于我欲与物欲所产生的罪恶之人的生活何等空虚、死板和悲哀！ <br />为认请这种生活的性质，也就是我欲和物欲的生活，或也可说，傲慢、贪婪、嫉妒、仇恨、报复、无情和奸淫的生活，就让有天赋的人为自己勾画其中某个罪恶；若有能力，就让他根据自己通过经验、知识和理智所形成的观念在自己眼前将其描绘出来。那么，他描述或描绘得越逼真，这些罪恶就越可怕，并且形像狰狞，其中毫无人性可言。凡发觉其生活的快乐就在于这类罪恶的人死后都会变成诸如此类的形像，并且其内心的快乐越大，他们自己的形像就越可怕。<br />另一方面，再让这人为自己勾勒出爱与仁的图画，或以某种形式在他眼前表现出来。那么他会看到，他描述或描绘得越逼真，就越能看到那形像如天使一般，充满幸福，优美无比，其中弥漫着天堂和神性之物。谁能相信这两种形像能够共存？或者恶魔的形像能够脱去，并转化为仁爱的形像，并且这一过程凭着与生活相背的信而实现？因为死后，每个人的生活，或也可说，他的情感会保留下来。那时，情感的性质就决定了其一切思维的性质，因而决定了其信的性质，而这信会照着它在内心里的样子呈现出来。</p>

Let me I pray bring them out unto you. That this signifies blessedness therefrom, that is, from the affections of good and of truth, is evident from the sense of these words when they are predicated 
of the affections which are here meant by the "daughters." As regards the thing itself, namely, that there is blessedness and happiness solely in the affection of good and of truth, it is a matter profoundly 
unknown to all who are in evil and its delight. To them the blessedness in the affection of good and of truth appears either as something that is nonexistent, or as something that is sad; while 
to some it appears as what is painful, and even deadly. This is the case with the genii and the spirits of hell, who think and believe that if the delight of the love of self and of the world, consequently 
of the evils therein originating, were taken away from them, nothing of life could remain to them; and when they are shown that true life with its blessedness and happiness then begins, they feel 
a kind of sadness from the loss of their own delight; and when they are brought among those who are in such a life, pain and torture seize upon them; and besides this, they then begin to feel in themselves 
something that is cadaverous and direfully infernal; so that they call heaven (which is the abode of this blessedness and happiness) their hell, and flee away, in order so far as possible to 
remove and hide themselves from the Lord's face. [2] That nevertheless all blessedness and happiness consist in the affection of the good which is of love and charity, and also of the truth which is 
of faith insofar as the latter leads to the former, can be seen from the fact that heaven (that is, angelic life) consists in this blessedness, and that it affects from the inmosts those who receive 
it, because it flows in through the inmosts from the Lord (see n. 540, 541, 545). Then also do wisdom and intelligence enter into and fill the inmost recesses of the mind, and kindle the good with heavenly 
flame, and the truth with heavenly light; and this with a perception of blessedness and happiness of which no description can be given except that they are unutterable. They who are in this state 
perceive how dead, how sad, and how lamentable is the life of those who are in the evils of the love of self and of the world. [3] In order to obtain a clear idea of the nature of this life of the 
love of self and of the world (or what is the same, of a life of pride, avarice, envy, hatred, revenge, unmercifulness, adultery), let any person of talent make for himself an impersonation of some one 
of these evils; or if he can, let him paint it before his eyes in accordance with the ideas he is able to conceive of it from experience, knowledge, and reason; and he will then see, in proportion to 
the energy of his description or picture, how horrible these evils are, and that they are diabolical forms, in which there is nothing human. Forms such as these do all those become after death who perceive 
the delight of their life in such evils, and the greater is their delight in them, the more horrible are their own forms. [4] On the other hand, let the same person delineate for himself an impersonation 
of love and charity, or let him express it before his eyes under some form; and then in proportion to his power of description or portrayal he will see that the form is angelic, full of bliss 
and beauty, and pervaded within with what is heavenly and Divine. Can anyone believe that these two forms can abide together? or that the diabolical form can be put off and be transmuted into the 
form of charity? and this by a faith to which the life is contrary? For after death everyone's life remains; or what is the same, his affection; and in accordance with this is then all his thought, and 
consequently his faith, which thus manifests itself as it had been at heart. </p>

'Let me now bring them out to you' means blessedness from these, that is to say, from the affections for good and for truth. This is clear from the meaning of these words when they have reference to 
the affections meant here by 'daughters'. As regards what is actually involved in all this - that is to say, in the reality that blessedness and happiness lie solely within the affection for good and 
for truth - all are completely ignorant who are immersed in and take delight in evil. The blessedness lying within the affection for good and for truth is seen by them either as something that does not 
exist, or as something dreary. By some it is seen to be something painful, or even deadly. This is so with the genii and spirits in hell. They imagine and believe that if the joy belonging to self-love 
and love of the world were withdrawn from them, and consequently the joy belonging to evils resulting from those loves, no life would be left to them. But when they are shown that such a withdrawal 
is the starting-point to life itself, bringing blessedness and happiness within, they experience a certain sadness at the loss of their own joy. And when they are brought into the company of others 
whose lives are such, pain and torment take hold of them. In addition they also start to feel at the same time within themselves something death-like and dreadfully hellish. For this reason they refer 
to heaven, where that blessedness and happiness reside, as their hell, and insofar as they are able to remove and hide themselves from the Lord's face they go as far away as they can. </p>
<p></p>
<p><b>[2]</b>
 Nevertheless 
everything that is blessed and happy lies in the affection for the good which flows from love and charity, and in the affection for truth that constitutes faith, insofar as such truth leads on to 
that good. This becomes clear from the fact that heaven, that is, angelic life, lies in everything blessed and happy and also from the fact that its influence is felt from things that are inmost, since 
it flows in from the Lord by way of inmost things, see <a href="540.htm">540</a>, <a href="541.htm">541</a>, <a href="545.htm">545</a>. At the same time wisdom and intelligence enter in and fill the inner recesses of the mind itself, kindling good with heavenly flame 
and truth with heavenly light. And this is accompanied by a perception of blessing and happiness which can only be called indescribable. People who have entered this state perceive how empty, how 
dreary, and how deplorable the life is of those who are subject to evils resulting from self-love and love of the world. </p>
<p></p>
<p><b>[3]</b>
 So that anyone may recognize the nature of this life, that is to say, the 
life of self-love and love of the world, or what amounts to the same, the life that goes with arrogance, greed, envy, hatred, revenge, ruthlessness, and adultery, let him who has the ability to do 
so caricature for himself some of these evils. Or if he is able, let him paint a picture that accords with the ideas he can get of it from experience, knowledge, and reason. He will in that case see, 
insofar as his drawing or painting of it is accurate, how shocking those evils are and that they are devilish forms with nothing human in them. After death all who perceive joy in such evils become devilish 
forms such as these. And the greater their joy the more dreadful those forms are. </p>
<p></p>
<p><b>[4]</b>
 But on the other hand if he caricatures love and charity for himself or also finds an expression of it for 
himself in some outward form, he will see, insofar as his drawing or portrayal is accurate, that it is an angelic form full of blessed and beautiful things, which has what is heavenly and Divine within 
it. Can anyone believe that those two forms are able to exist side by side, or that the devilish form can be thrown off and transformed into one of charity, and that this can be achieved by means 
of faith to which the life is contrary? For after death everyone's life, or what amounts to the same, his affection, remains. At that time the nature of affection determines the nature of all his thought, 
and consequently his faith, which manifests itself as it had existed in his heart. </p>

`Educam quaeso eas ad vos': quod significet beatitudinem ex illis, nempe ex affectionibus boni et veri, constat a sensu eorum verborum, cum praedicantur de affectionibus, quae per `filias' hic intelliguntur. 
 Quod ipsam rem attinet, nempe quod beatitudo e felicitas solum sit in affectione boni et veri, alte ignorant omnes qui in malo et ejus jucundo sunt; beatitudo in affectione boni et veri illi: 
apparet vel sicut quoddam nullum, vel sicut quoddam triste, quibusdam ut quoddam dolorificum, immo ut mortiferum; genii et spiritus infernales tales sunt; putant hi et credunt, si illis auferretur 
jucundum amoris sui et mundi, consequenter malorum inde, quod nihil vitae ii: superesse possit; at cum iis ostenditur quod tunc ipsa vita cum beato et felici incipiat, triste quoddam ex jactura sui jucundi 
sentiunt {1} et cum adducuntur inter (c)eos qui in tali vita sunt, dolor et cruciatu eos occupat; praeter quod tunc quoque sentire incipiant in se cadaverosum quoddam ac dirum infernale, quare vocant 
caelum in quo illud beatum et felix, suum infernum, et quantum se a facie Domini removere et abscondere possint {2}, aufugiunt. [2] Quod tamen usque omne beatum et felix consistat in affectione 
boni quod est amoris et charitatis, (c)ac veri quod fidei, quantum hoc ducit ad illud, constare potest ex eo quod caelum, hoc est, vita angelica in eo consistat, tum quod ab intimis afficiat, quia per 
intima influit a Domino, videatur n. 540, 541, 545; tunc etiam sapientia et intelligentia intrat et opplet ipsius mentis adyta, et incendit bonum caelesti flamma, (c)et verum caelesti luce, et hoc cum 
perceptione beati et felicis, de qua non nisi quam ineffabile praedicari potest; qui in hoc statu sunt, ii percipiunt quam nulla et quam tristis et quam lamentabilis vita sit illorum qui in malis amoris 
sui et mundi sunt.  [3] Sed ut sciat homo qualis haec vita sit respective, nempe vita amoris sui et mundi seu, quod idem, vita fastus, avaritiae, invidiae, odii, vindictae, immisericordiae, adulterii, 
qui aliqua ingenii dote pollet, characterem alicujus illorum sibi faciat, aut si possit, coram se, secundum ideas quas ab experientia, scientia et ratione de illis capere possit, depingat, tunc 
videbit quantum instat describendo vel depingendo, quam horrenda sint, et quod sint formae diabolicae in quibus nihil humanum; ejuscemodi formae fiunt omnes illi post mortem qui jucundum vitae in talibus 
percipiunt, ac eo horribiliores quo plus jucundi: [4] vicissim autem si characterem sibi faciat amoris  et charitatis, aut quoque per formam sibi illum exprimat, videbit quantum instat describendo 
aut delineando, quod forma sit angelica, plena beatis et pulchris, in qua caeleste et Divinum.  An quisquam credere possit quod binae illae formae simul esse possint; et {3} quod exui diabolica illa 
forma, et transcribi in formam charitatis queat, et hoc per fidem, cui contraria est vita?  Post mortem enim manet unumquemvis vita seu, quod idem, affectio; secundum hanc est (o)tunc omnis cogitatio, 
proinde fides, quae se sic manifestat qualis corde fuerat. 	@1 i in se.$ 	@2 possunt.$ 	@3 aut.$ </p>
