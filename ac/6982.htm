<h3 align="center" class="ired">属天的奥秘 第6982节</h3>
<h4 align="center"></h4><p><strong>6982.</strong>“我不是一个能言的人”表他没有话。这从“不是一个能言的人”的含义清楚可知，“不是一个能言的人”是指他不是一个能说会道的人，因而没有话。有必要说一说这是怎么回事。此处至高意义上所论述的主题是主，因为“摩西”代表神之律法，因而神之真理方面的主。直接从神性发出的真理无法被任何人听见，甚至无法被任何天使听见；神性若要被听见，就必须变成人；并且当经历众天堂时，它就变成了人。当经过众天堂时，它呈现为人的形式，变成言语，这言语由灵人说出；当灵人处于这种状态时，他们就被称为“圣灵”。不过，之所以说圣灵从神性发出，是因为一个灵人的神圣，或那时这个灵人所说的神圣真理是从主发出的。由此可见，直接从神性发出的真理若不通过圣灵，就无法以所说的话或言语呈现给任何人。这就是代表神之真理方面的主的摩西说，他“不是一个能言的人”，以及他的兄弟亚伦与他联合的事实在至高意义上所表示的；亚伦代替他的口服事他，他则代替神服事亚伦。</p>

I am not a man of words. That this signifies that he has no speech, is evident from the signification of "not a man of words," as being not to have the faculty of speaking, thus to have no speech. How 
this is shall be told. Here in the supreme sense the subject treated of is the Lord, for Moses represents the Lord as to the law Divine, thus as to truth Divine. The truth which proceeds immediately 
from the Divine cannot be heard by anyone, not even by any angel; for in order to be heard the Divine must first become human; and it becomes human when it passes through the heavens; and when it has 
passed through the heavens it is presented in human form, and becomes speech, which speech is uttered by spirits, who when they are in this state, are called the "Holy Spirit," and this is said to proceed 
from the Divine, because the holy of the spirit, or the holy truth which the spirit then speaks, proceeds from the Lord. From this it can be seen that the truth which proceeds immediately from the 
Divine cannot be presented to anyone as discourse or speech, except through the Holy Spirit. This is meant in the supreme sense by the statement that Moses, who represents the Lord as to truth Divine, 
says that "he is not a man of words;" and by the fact that Aaron his brother was adjoined to him, who was to him "for a mouth," and he to Aaron "for God." </p>

'I am not a man of words' means that he is lacking in speech. This is clear from the meaning of 'a man of words' as the fact that he is not an able speaker, and so is lacking in speech. What all this 
entails must be stated. The subject here in the highest sense is the Lord, for 'Moses' represents the Lord in respect of the law of God, thus in respect of God's truth. Truth that goes forth directly 
from the Divine cannot be heard by anyone, not even by any angel; if what is Divine is to be heard it must first be made human, and it is made human when it passes through the heavens. When it has passed 
through the heavens it is presented in a human form and becomes speech, speech which is uttered by spirits who, while they are in that state, are called the Holy Spirit. But the Holy Spirit is said 
to come forth from the Divine because what is holy with a spirit, namely the holy truth uttered by him at that time, comes forth from the Lord. From all this one may recognize that truth coming forth 
directly from the Divine cannot be presented to anyone as spoken word or speech except by means of the Holy Spirit. This is what is meant in the highest sense when Moses, who represents the Lord in 
respect of God's truth, says that he is 'not a man of words', and by the fact that Aaron his brother was to be attached to him; Aaron was to serve him in place of his mouth, and he was to serve Aaron 
in God's place.  </p>

`Non vir verborum ego': quod significet quod illi non loquela, constat ex significatione `viri verborum' quod sit quod illi non facultas loquendi, ita quod non loquela.  Quomodo hoc se habet, dicendum: 
in supremo sensu agitur hic de Domino, nam `Moscheh' Dominum quoad legem Divinam, ita quoad verum Divinum, repraesentat; verum quod immediate procedit a Divino non audiri potest ulli, ne quidem alicui 
angelo; Divinum enim {1} ut audiatur, fiet primo humanum, et humanum fit cum transit per caelos, cumque transivit per caelos sistitur in humana forma et fit loquela, quae loquela enuntiatur per spiritus 
qui cum in illo statu sunt, vocantur {2}Spiritus Sanctus, et ille dicitur procedere a Divino, quia sanctum spiritus seu sanctum verum quod spiritus {3}ille tunc loquitur a Domino procedit; ex 
his constare potest quod verum quod procedit immediate a Divino non possit sisti alicui ut sermo aut loquela, nisi per Spiritum Sanctum; hoc intelligitur in sensu supremo per {4}quod Moscheh, qui {5}repraesentat 
Dominum quoad verum Divinum, {6} dicat se non esse virum verborum, et per id quod ei adjunctus {7}fuerit Aharon frater ejus, qui illi pro ore esset, et is Aharoni pro deo. 	@1 i est, quod$ 	@2
