<h3 align="center" class="ired">属天的奥秘 第2572节</h3>
<h4 align="center"></h4><p><strong>2572.</strong>“哪里在你眼里看为好，就住在哪里”表祂存在于（Being或Esse）具有良善的一切事物中，并且在近似意义上表祂存在于（Being或Esse）教义的良善中。这从“眼”和“住”的含义清楚可知：“眼”是指心智的理解力部分，也就是接受教义的器皿；“住”是指生活（<a href="1293.htm">1293</a>节），在此是指存在（Being或Esse），因为这句话论及主。存在于（Esse）具有良善的一切事物中就是存在于（Esse）对一切神性、属天、属灵、理性和属世之物中，其原因在于神性之爱；因为神性之爱里面有对所有这些事物的全知（<a href="2500.htm">2500</a>节）。<br />而且，既有教义的良善，也有教义真理。教义的良善是爱与仁，教义的真理是信。具有教义的良善，即爱与仁的人也具有教义的真理，即信。但具有良善，即爱与仁是一回事，具有教义的良善则是另一回事。具有对父母的爱和对其他小孩子的仁爱的小孩具有良善，但没有教义的良善，因而没有教义的真理，即没有信。具有教义的良善之人是指那些已通过信之真理重生的人。他们越具有良善，就越具有真理，也就是说，越具有爱与仁，就越具有信，因而越具有智慧聪明。<br />天使因具有对主之爱和相爱，故也具有一切真理，因而具有一切智慧聪明，不仅有关于属天和属灵之物的，还有关于理性和属世之物的。爱来自主，他们凭爱而处于事物的起源或源头中，即处于它们的目的和原因中。从起源，即从目的和原因观看，就是从天上观看下面的一切事物，甚至地上的那些事物。打个比方，人站在高山的了望塔上能看到下面四周数英里的事物；而在下面的那些人，尤其是山谷和森林里的人几乎看不到数步之远。那些具有教义的良善之人相比那些具有脱离其良善的教义真理之人也是如此。尽管后者以为他们能比前者看得更远。而事实上，他们根本看不到任何良善，也看不到任何真理，除了浮在很表面的那种外，甚至连这样的真理也被虚假玷污了。<br />然而，即便是天使的智慧与聪明也是有限的，与主的神性智慧相比，是最有限的，几乎等同于无。这一点从以下两个事实明显看出来：一是，无限和有限之间不存在比率关系，然而通过神性全知交流是可能的；二是，主是良善本身和爱本身，因而是良善的存在本身，是天使所具有的爱的存在本身，因而是他们的智慧聪明的存在本身。由此可见，主存在于具有良善的一切事物中，无论天上还是地上。人若以为主存在于脱离良善的真理中，就大错特错了。因为祂唯独存在于良善中，并由此存在于真理中；也就是说，存在于爱与仁中，并由此存在于信中。</p>

Dwell in that which is good in thine eyes. That this signifies that He was in everything where there was good (in the proximate sense, that He was in the good of doctrine) is evident from the signification 
of "eyes," as being the intellectual, which is of doctrine; and from the signification of "dwelling," as being to live (n. 1293); here Esse [being], because it is predicated of the Lord. Esse in 
everything where there is good, is Esse in the omniscience of all Divine, celestial, spiritual, rational, and natural things, and this from Divine love; for in the Divine Love there is omniscience of 
all these things (n. 2500). [2] Moreover there are both the good and the truth of doctrine. The good of doctrine is love and charity, the truth of doctrine is faith. They who are in the good of doctrine, 
that is, in love and charity, are in the truth of doctrine, that is, in faith. But it is one thing to be in good, or in love and charity, and another to be in the good of doctrine. Little children 
who are in love to their parents and in charity toward other little children are in good, but not in the good of doctrine, consequently not in the truth of doctrine, or faith. But they who have been 
regenerated by the truths of faith are in the good of doctrine. Insofar as these are in good, so far are they in truths; that is, insofar as they are in love and charity, so far are they in faith, 
consequently, so far in wisdom and intelligence. [3] The angels, being in love to the Lord and in mutual love, are also in all truth, and thus in all wisdom and intelligence; not only in regard to celestial 
and spiritual things, but also in regard to rational and natural things; for from love, because from the Lord, they are in the very principles or springs of things; that is, in their ends and 
causes. To see from principles, or from ends and causes, is to see from heaven all things that are below, even those which are on the earth. To use a comparison, this is like one who is on a high mountain, 
in a watchtower, who is able to look around for many miles upon the things below; while they who are below, especially if they are in a valley or in a forest, can scarcely see as many paces. Precisely 
so is it with those who are in the good of doctrine, in comparison with those who are in the truth of doctrine separated from its good; although the latter think that they see farther than the 
former. Nevertheless these see nothing of good, nor anything of truth except very slightly on the surface, and even this defiled by falsities. [4] Yet at the best the wisdom and intelligence of angels 
is finite, and in comparison with the Lord's Divine wisdom, most finite, and scarcely anything; as is evident from the fact that between the Infinite and the finite there is no ratio; but yet there 
is a communication from the Divine omnipotence; and also from the fact that the Lord is Good Itself and Love Itself, consequently the Esse itself of good, and the Esse itself of the love that exists with 
the angels, and thus the Esse itself of their wisdom and intelligence. From this we can see that the Lord is in everything in which there is good, both in heaven and on earth. They who think that 
the Lord is in truth separate from good are much mistaken. He is not in anything but good, and from that in truth; that is, in love and charity, and from that in faith. </p>

<p align="center"><b>Elliott(1983-1999) 2572</b></p><p><b>2572.</b>
'Dwell in that which is good in your eyes' means His Being, present in everything where good exists, and in the proximate sense His Being, present in the good of doctrine. This becomes clear from the 
meaning of 'the eyes' as the understanding part of the mind, which is the recipient of doctrine, and from the meaning of 'dwelling' as living, <a href="1293.htm">1293</a>, here as Being (Esse) because what is said has reference 
to the Lord. This Being (Esse), present in everything where good exists, is the essential being within a complete knowledge of all Divine, celestial, spiritual, rational, and natural things. And 
the reason for this lies with Divine Love, for Divine Love holds within itself a complete knowledge of all those things, <a href="2500.htm">2500</a>. </p>
<p></p>
<p><b>[2]</b>
 What is more, there is the good of doctrine and there is the truth 
of doctrine. The good of doctrine is love and charity, the truth of doctrine is faith. People with whom the good of doctrine resides, that is, love and charity, have with them the truth of doctrine, 
that is, faith. But it is one thing for good, that is, love and charity, to exist with a person, quite another for the good of doctrine to do so. Young children with whom love towards parents and charity 
towards other young children exist are moved by good but not by the good of doctrine, nor consequently by the truth of doctrine, or faith. The people with whom the good of doctrine exists are those 
who have been regenerated by means of the truths of faith. To the extent that good resides with them truths reside with them; that is, to the extent that love and charity reside with them so does faith, 
and therefore wisdom and intelligence. </p>
<p></p>
<p><b>[3]</b>
 Because love to the Lord and mutual love resides with angels, so also does all truth and thus all wisdom and intelligence, not only in celestial and 
spiritual things but also in rational and natural. For by virtue of love, it being from the Lord, they are in touch with the very beginnings or sources of things, that is, with ends in view and causes. 
Seeing from beginnings, that is, from ends and causes, is seeing from heaven all things that are below, even those on earth. This is like - to use a comparison - someone in a watch-tower set on a high 
mountain. He is able to look around for many miles on the objects that are below, while those who are below, especially those down in a valley or in a forest, can hardly see the same number of paces 
away. So it is with those governed by the good of doctrine in comparison with those governed by the truth of doctrine separated from good. Although the latter imagine that they can see further than 
the former, they do not in fact see any good at all, nor any truth except very slightly and superficially, and even that is defiled by falsities. </p>
<p></p>
<p><b>[4]</b>
 Even so, the wisdom and intelligence of angels 
is finite, and in comparison with the Lord's Divine Wisdom most finite, amounting to hardly anything. This may be recognized from the fact that the infinite and the finite cannot be measured one against 
the other, and yet communication from the Divine omnipotence is possible; also from the fact that the Lord is Good itself and Love itself, and is therefore the Essential Being (Esse) of good and the 
Essential Being (Esse) of love which resides with angels, and so the Essential Being (Esse) of their wisdom and intelligence. From this it may also be evident that the Lord is present in heaven and 
on earth in everything where good exists. People who imagine that the Lord is present in truth separated from good are very much mistaken, for He is present solely in good and from this in truth, that 
is, in love and charity, and from these in faith. </p>

Quod `in bono in oculis tuis habita' significet quod in omni esset ubi bonum, in proximo sensu quod in bono doctrinae, constare potest a significatione `oculorum' qui significant intellectuale quod 
est doctrinae, et ex significatione `habitare' quod est vivere, n. 1293, hic Esse quia praedicatur de Domino. (m)Esse in omni ubi bonum, est esse in omniscientia omnium Divinorum, caelestium, spiritualium, 
rationalium et naturalium, et hoc ex Divino Amore, Divino enim Amori inest omniscientia omnium illorum, n. 2500.(n)  [2] Praeterea doctrinae datur bonum et verum; doctrinae bonum est amor et charitas, 
doctrinae verum est fides; qui in doctrinae bono sunt, hoc est, in amore et charitate, sunt in doctrinae vero, hoc est, in fide: sed aliud est in bono esse, seu in amore et charitate, et aliud 
in doctrinae bono; infantes qui in amore erga parentes sunt et in charitate erga alios infantes, in bono sunt, non autem in doctrinae bono, proinde non in doctrinae vero seu [in] fide; at in doctrinae 
bono sunt illi qui per vera fidei regenerati sunt, hi quantum in bono, tantum in veris sunt, hoc est, quantum in amore et charitate, tantum in fide, proinde tantum in sapientia et intelligentia. [3] 
Angeli quia in amore in Dominum et in amore mutuo, etiam in omni vero sunt, ita in omni sapientia et intelligentia, non solum rerum caelestium et spiritualium, sed etiam rationalium et naturalium; ex 
amore enim quia a Domino, sunt in ipsis principiis seu fontibus rerum, hoc est, in finibus et causis; ex principiis seu finibus et causis videre, est e caelo omnia quae infra sunt, etiam quae in terra; 
se habet hoc comparative sicut qui in alta monte ac in turri speculatoria ibi, is circumspicere potest ad plura milliaria illa quae infra sunt, cum illi qui infra, et magis qui in valle aut in silva, 
vix possunt ad totidem passus; ita se quoque habet cum illis qui in doctrinae bono sunt, respective ad illos qui in doctrinae vero separato a bono, (m)tametsi hi putant se longius videre quam illi, 
sed usque nihil boni vident, nec quicquam veri nisi levissime in superficie, et hoc conspurcatum falsis(n): [4] verumtamen sapientia et intelligentia angelorum est finita, et respective ad Divinam Domini 
finitissima et vix quicquam; ut constare potest ex eo quod inter infinitum et finitum non detur ratio, at usque communicatio ex Divina omni potentia; et ex eo quod Dominus sit Ipsum Bonum, et Ipse 
Amor proinde ipsum Esse boni, et {1} ipsum Esse amoris qui apud angelos ita ipsum Esse sapientiae et intelligentiae eorum. Inde etiam {2} patet quod Dominus in caelo et in terra sit in omni {3} ubi bonum; 
nimium falluntur qui putant quod Dominus sit in vero separato a bono, non {4} est nisi quam in bono, et inde in vero, hoc est, in amore et charitate et inde in fide. 	@1 aut.$ 	@2 nunc.$ 	@3
