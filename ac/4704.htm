Verses 12-17. And his brethren went to feed the flock of their father in Shechem. And Israel said unto Joseph, Do not thy brethren feed the flock in Shechem? Come, and I will send thee unto them. And 
he said to him, Behold me! And he said to him, Go I pray see the peace of thy brethren, and the peace of the flock, and bring me word again. And he sent him out of the valley of Hebron, and he came to 
Shechem. And a man found him, and behold he was wandering in the field; and the man asked him, saying, What seekest thou? And he said, I seek my brethren, tell me I pray where they are feeding the flock. 
And the man said, They are departed hence, for I heard them say, Let us go to Dothan. And Joseph went after his brethren, and found them in Dothan. "And his brethren went to feed the flock," signifies 
those who teach from faith; "of their father," signifies of the Ancient and of the Primitive Church; "in Shechem," signifies the first rudiments; "and Israel said unto Joseph," signifies perception 
from the Divine spiritual; "Do not thy brethren feed the flock in Shechem?" signifies that they are teaching; "come, and I will send      thee unto them" signifies that it should teach Divine spiritual 
goods; "and he said to him, Behold me," signifies affirmation; "and he said to him, Go I pray see the peace of thy brethren," signifies every coming of the Lord, and perception how it was with 
those who taught; "and the peace of the flock," signifies how it was with those who were learning, or the church; "and bring me word again," signifies knowledge; "and he sent him out of the valley of 
Hebron," signifies from the natural and sensuous Divine; "and he came to Shechem," signifies the knowledge of general doctrinals; "and a man found him, and behold he was wandering in the field," signifies 
that they were fallen away from the general truth of the church; "and the man asked him, saying, What seekest thou?" signifies foresight; "and he said, I seek my brethren, tell me I pray where they 
are feeding the flock," signifies the knowledge of how the case was, and in what state they were; "and the man said, They are departed hence, for I heard them say, Let us go to Dothan," signifies that 
they betook themselves from generals to special things of doctrine; "and Joseph went after his brethren, and found them in Dothan," signifies that they were in the special things of false principles. </p>

Verses 12-17 And his brothers went to pasture the flock of their father, in Shechem. And Israel said to Joseph, Are not your brothers pasturing [the flock] in Shechem? Go, and I will send you to them. 
And he said to him, Behold, here I am. And he said to him, Go now, see the peace of your brothers and the peace of the flock,<A name="fntext1"></a><A href="#fn1"><sup>a</sup></a> and bring back word to me. And he sent him out of the Valley of Hebron 
and he came to Shechem. And a man found him, and behold, he was wandering in the field; and the man asked him, saying, What are you looking for? And he said, I am looking for my brothers; tell me now, 
where they are pasturing [the flock]. And the man said, They have travelled on from here, for I heard them saying, Let us go to Dothan. And Joseph went after his brothers, and found them in Dothan. </p>

that it would teach Divine spiritual forms of good. 'And he said, Behold, here I am' means assent. 'And he said to him, Go now, see the peace of your brothers' means every coming of the Lord, and a 
perception of what the situation was with those who taught. 'And the peace of the flock' means what the situation was with those who learned, that is, with the Church. 'And bring back word to me' means 
knowledge 'And he sent him out of the Valley of Hebron' means going forth from the Divine Natural and Sensory degrees. 'And he came to Shechem' means knowledge of the general aspects of doctrine. 'And 
a man found him, and behold, he was wandering in the field' means that they had fallen away from general truth known to the Church. 'And the man asked him, saying, What are you looking for?' means 
foresight. 'And he said, I am looking for my brothers; tell me now, where they are pasturing [the flock]' means knowledge of what the situation was and what their state was. 'And the man said, They have 
travelled on from here, for I heard them saying, Let us go to Dothan' means that they moved on from the general aspects to the specific details of doctrine. 'And Joseph went after his brothers, and 
found them in Dothan' means that they were steeped in the specific details belonging to false assumptions.
