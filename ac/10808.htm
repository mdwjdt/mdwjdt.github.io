<h3 align="center" class="ired">属天的奥秘 第10808节</h3>
<h4 align="center"></h4><p>星空中的第六颗星球-续<br /><strong>10808</strong>.当时与我交谈的灵人来自他们星球的北部。之后我被带到来自西部的灵人那里。他们也想查明我是谁，是什么样的人，立刻开始说，我里面除了邪恶外什么也没有；他们以为这样说就会阻止我接近。我发觉这是他们对所有新来者说的第一句话。但我被引导回答说，我充分意识到这一点，并且他们里面同样除了邪恶外什么也没有。由于每个人都生在恶中，因而凡来自世人、灵人和天使，也就是来自自己或自我之物无非是邪恶；因为凡与一个人同住的良善都来自主。他们由此意识到，我掌握真理；于是，他们允许我与他们交谈。然后，他们向我展示了他们对存在于人里面的邪恶和从主所获得的良善如何分开的概念。他们将一个放在另一个旁边，几乎接触，但仍是分开的。然而，它们似乎以一种无法描述的方式被联络在一起，好叫良善能引导邪恶并遏制它，不让它随心所欲地行动；良善就这样将邪恶折向良善所渴望的东西，而邪恶却没有意识这一点。他们以这种方式来表现良善对邪恶的掌控，同时表现邪恶被良善引向良善，因而引向主所在的自由状态；事实上，他们从对良善的观念获得对主的观念，因为良善来自主。</p>

CONTINUATION ABOUT THE SIXTH EARTH IN THE STARRY HEAVEN. These spirits, with whom I now conversed, were from the northern part of their earth. I was next conducted to others who were from the western 
part. These too, wishing to search out who I was, and of what quality, at once said that there was nothing but evil in me. They thought that in this way I should be deterred from approaching nearer. 
It was perceived that this is the first thing they say to all who come to them. But it was given me to reply that I well know that such is the case, and that in them likewise there is nothing but evil; 
for the reason that everyone is born into evil, and therefore whatever comes of man, spirit, and angel, coming as it does from what belongs to himself, that is, from what is his own, is nothing but 
evil; because all the good that is in anyone is from the Lord. From this they perceived that I was in the truth, and I was admitted to speak with them; and they then showed me their idea about evil in 
man, and about good from the Lord; in what manner they are kept separate from each other. They set one near the other, almost contiguous, but still separate, yet as it were bound in an unspeakable manner, 
so that the good led the evil, and bridled it; so that it was not allowed to act at its pleasure; and that in this way the good bent the evil to what it desired, without the evil being aware of 
it. In this manner they set forth the rule of good over evil, and at the same time the free state in which evil is led by good to good, thus to the Lord; for from their idea of good they had an idea 
of the Lord, because it is from Him. </p>

THE SIXTH PLANET OUT IN SPACE - continued  </p>
<p>The spirits whom I talked to then were from the northern part of their planet. After that I was taken to others who were from the western part. These, having 
a similar wish to find out who I was and what I was like, immediately began to say that I was thoroughly evil; they thought, if they said this, that I would be deterred from coming any nearer. I 
sensed that this was the first thing they said to all newcomers. But I was led to reply that I was fully aware of it, and that they likewise were thoroughly evil, since everyone is born into evil, and 
therefore whatever comes from man, spirit, or angel - that is, from the self or proprium - is nothing but evil; for any good that resides with a person comes from the Lord. From this they realized that 
I was in possession of the truth; so they allowed me to talk to them. They demonstrated to me then their conception of how the evil present in a person and good received from the Lord are kept apart. 
They set the two next to each other, almost touching but nevertheless separated. Yet they were seemingly bound together in an indescribable way, so that good could lead evil and check it, preventing 
it from acting however it liked, and so that good could thereby direct evil towards what good desired, though evil would not know it. This was how they presented the rule of good over evil and at the 
same time the free state in which evil is led by good towards good, thus towards the Lord; for from their picture of good they had a picture of the Lord since the good comes from Him.  </p>

Hi spiritus cum quibus nunc locutus sum erant a parte septentrionali suae telluris; dein perlatus sum ad alios qui erant a parte occidentali; hi quoque volentes explorare quinam essem et qualis, statim 
dicebant quod apud me nihil nisi quam malum {1}esset; cogitabant sic quod deterrerer a propius accedendo; {2}apperceptum quod {3}ita ad omnes qui adventant, primum dicant; sed respondere dabatur quod 
sciam bene quod ita sit, et {4} quod apud illos similiter nihil nisi quam malum sit, ex causa quia omnis nascitur in malum, et {5}ideo quicquid ab homine, spiritu, (c)ac angelo, ut a suo seu proprio 
venit, non est nisi quam malum, {6}quoniam omne bonum quod {7}apud unumquemvis, est a Domino; inde appercipiebant quod in veritate essem, et admittebar ad loquendum cum illis; et tunc ostendebant mihi 
suam ideam de malo apud hominem, et de bono a Domino, quomodo ab invicem separantur; ponebant unum juxta alterum, paene ut {8}contigua, sed usque {9}separata, at quasi vincta ineffabili modo ita ut 
bonum duceret malum, et frenaret illud, ut non liceret ei agere {10} ex lubitu, et quod bonum sic flecteret malum ad quod vellet, {11}praeterquam quod malum id {12}resciret; ita sistebant dominium boni 
super malum et simul {13}statum liberum in quo malum ducitur a bono ad bonum, ita ad {14} Dominum, nam de idea boni habebant ideam Domini, quia est ab Ipso. @1 sit, cogitant$ @2 perceptum$ @3 sic$ @4
