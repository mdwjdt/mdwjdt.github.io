<h3 align="center" class="ired">属天的奥秘 第1914节</h3>
<h4 align="center"></h4><p><strong>1914.</strong>“我因你受屈，我将我的婢女放在你怀中”表它不愿承受任何责备。这是显而易见的，无需解释。就内义而言，这些话包含以下真理：主发觉这第一理性竟至如此，以至于轻视智性真理，主为此斥责它。因为主通过智性真理思考，如前所述（<a href="1904.htm">1904</a>节）。由于智性真理超越理性，所以祂能直觉并发现该理性的性质，也就是说，它轻视智性真理。<br />主能通过内层人直觉并发现祂自己里面的新理性具有何种性质。这从以下事实可以看出来：内层能觉察发生在外层的一切事，或也可说，高层能看到发生在低层的事，但反过来不行。而且，那些有良知的人能做到这一点，并习惯于这样做。因为当违背构成良知的真理之事流入其思维，或意愿的意图时，他们不仅能觉察到它，还会指责它，甚至还会因为自己具有这样的秉性而悲痛。拥有直觉的人更能做到这一点，因为直觉在理性中更为内在。那么主又有什么做不到的呢？祂拥有神性的属天直觉，其思维源于对智性真理的情感，而智性真理远在理性之上。因此，主必感到义愤，因为祂知道恶或假根本不是源于祂自己。出于对真理的情感，祂竭尽全力，拼命使这理性纯洁。这表明主不轻视智性真理，然而却发觉祂里面的第一理性轻视它。<br />至于何为通过智性真理思考，这无法解释清楚，更不用说通过智性真理思考了。因为除了主以外，没有人曾通过这情感和这真理思考。凡由此思考之人都在天使天堂之上，因为第三层天的天使也不是通过智性真理思考，而是通过理性的内层思考。但是，只要主将其人性本质和神性本质融合起来，祂就会通过神性良善本身，即耶和华思考。<br />上古教会的早期先祖虽拥有直觉，却通过内在理性思考。古教会的先祖没有直觉，但有良知；他们通过外在理性，或属世理性思考。然而，凡没有良知之人根本不通过理性思考，因为他们没有理性，尽管他们看似理性。他们通过感官和肉体的属世层思考。没有良知的人无法通过理性思考，原因就象刚才说的，他们根本没有理性。理性人是指通过信的善与真思想之人，凡思想其反面的，决不是理性人。思想恶与假之人，其思维是疯狂的，因此，他们决没有理性。</p>

My wrong be upon thee; I gave my handmaid into thy bosom. That this signifies unwillingness to take blame upon itself, is evident without explication. In the internal sense there is involved in these 
words that the Lord perceived this first rational to be such as to lightly esteem intellectual truth, on which account He rebuked it. For the Lord thought from intellectual truth, as before said (n. 
1904); and because this truth is above the rational, it could perceive and see the quality of this rational, namely, that it held that truth in low esteem.  [2] That the Lord could perceive and see from 
the interior man what was the quality of the new rational in Himself, may be seen from the fact that the interior can perceive what takes place in the exterior, or what is the same, that the higher 
can see what is in the lower; but not the reverse. Moreover they who have conscience can do this and are accustomed to do it, for when anything contrary to the truth of conscience flows into the thought, 
or into the endeavor of the will, they not only perceive it, but also find fault with it; and it even grieves them to be of such a character. Still more can those do this who have perception, as 
perception is more interior in the rational. What then could not the Lord do, who had Divine celestial perception, and thought from the affection of intellectual truth, which is above the rational! Therefore 
He could not but be indignant, knowing that nothing of evil and falsity was from Himself, and that from the affection of truth He took the greatest pains that His rational should be pure. This 
shows that the Lord did not lightly esteem intellectual truth, but that He perceived the first rational in Himself to be thinking lightly of it.  [3] What it is to think from intellectual truth cannot 
be explained to the apprehension, and the less so because no one but the Lord ever thought from this affection and from this truth. He who thinks therefrom is above the angelic heaven, for even the 
angels of the third heaven do not think from intellectual truth, but from the interior of the rational. But so far as the Lord united His Human Essence to His Divine Essence, He thought from the Divine 
good itself, that is, from Jehovah.  [4] The fathers of the Most Ancient Church who had perception, thought from the interior rational. The fathers of the Ancient Church, who had not perception but 
conscience, thought from the exterior or natural rational. But all who are without conscience do not think at all from the rational, since they have not the rational, although they appear to have it; 
but they think from the sensuous and corporeal natural. The reason why they who have no conscience cannot think from the rational, is that they have no rational, as just said. The rational man is he 
who thinks the good and truth of faith, and by no means he who thinks contrary thereto. They who think evil and falsity are insane in their thought, and therefore the rational can by no means be predicated of them. </p>

That 'may the wrong done to me be on you! I gave my servant-girl into your bosom' means its unwillingness to take any blame is clear without explanation. In the internal sense these words embody within 
themselves the truth that the Lord perceived this first rational to be such as despised intellectual truth, and for that reason }{e reproached it. The Lord did indeed think from intellectual truth, 
as stated above in <a href="1904.htm">1904</a>; and because that truth was superior to the rational, He was able to perceive and see the nature of the rational, that is to say, that it held that truth in contempt. </p>
<p></p>
<p><b>[2]</b>
 The 
Lord's being able from the interior man to perceive and see the nature of the new rational within Himself becomes clear from the fact that what is interior is able to perceive that which occurs in 
the exterior, or what amounts to the same, what is higher is able to see that which occurs in that which is lower, but not the reverse Moreover, those who have conscience are able and are accustomed to 
do the same, for when anything contrary to the truth constituting conscience enters their thought or the intentions of their will, they not only recognize it for what it is but also pour blame upon 
it; indeed it grieves them that their own nature is such. This is all the more true of those who have perception, for perception is more interior within the rational. What then could the Lord not do who 
had Divine celestial perception and whose thought sprang from the affection for intellectual truth which is above the rational? Therefore He could not be anything else but righteously angry since He 
knew that no evil or falsity at all stemmed from Himself and that from the affection for truth He strove anxiously with all His might so that the rational might be pure. From this it becomes clear that 
the Lord did not despise intellectual truth, yet perceived that the first rational with Him did so. </p>
<p></p>
<p><b>[3]</b>
 What thinking from intellectual truth is cannot be explained intelligibly, all the less so 
because nobody except the Lord has ever thought from that affection and that kind of truth. Anyone who thinks from them is above the angelic heaven, for the angels of the third heaven do not think from 
intellectual truth but from the interior part of the rational. But to the extent that the Lord united the Human Essence to the Divine Essence, He thought from Divine Good itself, that is, from Jehovah. </p>
<p></p>
<p><b>[4]</b>
The early fathers of the Most Ancient Church, who had perception, thought from the interior rational. The fathers of the Ancient Church, who did not have perception but conscience, thought 
from the exterior or natural rational. But all who do not have conscience never think from the rational at all, since they have no rational however much they appear to do so. Instead they think from 
the sensory and the bodily experience of the natural. People who do not have conscience are unable to think from the rational for the reason, as has been stated, that they have no rational. The rational 
man is one in whom the good and truth of faith are the substance of his thought and never one who thinks in opposition to these. Those in whom evil and falsity are the substance of their thought are 
insane as to their thought and therefore the rational cannot be attributed to them. </p>

Quod `injuria mea super te, ego dedi ancillam meam in sinum tuum' significet quod illa non culpam in se accipere vellet, constat absque explicatione: haec in sensu interno involvunt quod Dominus perceperit 
hoc primum rationale tale esse ut vilipenderet verum intellectuale, quare illud redarguit; cogitavit enim Dominus ex vero intellectuali, ut dictum (o)supra n. 1904, quod quia supra rationale, 
percipere et videre potuit quale rationale esset, nempe quod vile haberet verum illud.  [2] Quod Dominus ab interiore percipere et videre potuerit quale esset novum rationale apud Se, constare potest 
inde quod interius percipere queat quid existit in exteriore, seu quod idem, quod superius possit videre quid in inferiore, sed non vicissim; etiam qui conscientiam habent, hoc possunt et solent facere, 
dum enim aliquid influit contra verum conscientiae in cogitationem aut {1} in conatum voluntatis, non solum id appercipiunt, sed etiam incusant, immo indolet illis quod tales; magis qui perceptionem, 
nam perceptio est interior in rationali; quid non Dominus, Qui habuit perceptionem caelestem Divinam, et ex affectione veri intellectualis quod supra rationale est, cogitationem; quare non potuit non 
quam indignari, sciens quod nihil mali et falsi ex Semet, et quod ex affectione veri summa opera sollicitus fuerit ut rationale esset purum: (m)inde constare potest quod Dominus non vilipenderet {2} 
verum intellectuale, sed quod perceperit quod primum rationale apud `illum, illud vilipenderet.(n)  [3] Quid sit cogitare ex vero intellectuali {3}, non explicari `potest ad captum,' et eo minus, quia 
nemo ex illa affectione et ex illo vero cogitavit quam Dominus; qui inde cogitat, is supra caelum angelicum, nam angeli tertii caeli non cogitant ex vero intellectuali, sed ex `interiore rationalis; 
(m)at quantum (t)Dominus univit Essentiam Humanam Divinae, cogitavit ex Ipso Divino Bono, hoc est, ex Jehovah(n): [4] Antiquissimae Ecclesiae patres, qui perceptionem habuerunt, cogitarunt ex interiore 
rationali; Ecclesiae Antiquae patres, qui non perceptionem sed conscientiam habuerunt, cogitarunt ex rationali exteriore seu naturali {5}; omnes autem qui absque conscientia sunt, nusquam cogitant 
ex rationali, nam non rationale habent tametsi apparet sicut haberent: sed cogitant ex naturali sensuali et corporeo {6}; quod illi qui non conscientiam, non ex rationali cogitare possint, causa est, 
ut dictum quia rationale non habent; rationalis homo est qui cogitat bonum ei verum fidei, nusquam qui contra illud; qui cogitant malum et falsum. insaniunt cogitatione, quare de illis nusquam rationale 
praedicari potest. 	@1 et.$ 	@2 vilipenderit.$ 	@3 A had quid sit cogitare ex intellectuali vero, d last two words and substitutes affectione veri intellectualis.  In copying S seems to have preferred
