<h4 align="center"></h4><p><strong>2476.</strong>至于人的外部记忆，情况是这样：尽管他保留了一切外部记忆，无论总体还是细节，但那时，他不可以使用外部记忆，只能使用内部记忆。其原因有很多，第一个原因如前所述，也就是说，在来世，人能通过内部记忆与全宇宙所有人交谈和互动。第二个原因是，内部记忆适合灵，并适合灵那时的状态。因为外在事物，也就是记忆知识、世俗之物和肉体之物适合人，并与他在这个世界和肉身时的状态相对应。而内在事物，也就是那些理性、属灵和属天之物，则适合他的灵，并与之相对应。</p>

<p align="center"><b>Potts(1905-1910) 2476</b></p><p><b>2476.</b>
But as regards man's exterior memory, the case is this: He has all things of it with him both in general and in particular; but he is not then allowed to use this memory, but only the interior memory. 
The reasons are many; the first being that which has been stated, namely, that from the interior memory one can speak and have interaction in the other life with all in the universe. The second is, 
that this memory is proper to the spirit and is adapted to the state in which it then is; for exterior things-that is, those of memory-knowledge, of the world, and of the body-are adapted to man and correspond 
to his state while he is in the world and the body; but interior things-that is, things rational, spiritual, and celestial-are adapted and correspond to his spirit. </p>

<p align="center"><b>Elliott(1983-1999) 2476</b></p><p><b>2476.</b>
So far as his exterior memory is concerned, though he retains every single part of it he is not allowed to use it, only the interior memory. The reasons for this are many. The first, which has been stated 
already, is that from his interior memory he is enabled in the next life to speak and mix universally with everyone. The second is that this memory belongs properly to the spirit and is suited to 
its state at that time. For exterior things, that is to say, facts, worldly things, and bodily things, are suited to man and correspond to his state while he is in the world and in the body. But interior 
things, that is to say, those that are rational, spiritual, and celestial, are suited to and correspond to his spirit. </p>

</p><b>2476.</b>
Sed ita se habet cum memoria ejus exteriore quod omnia et singula ejus secum habeat, sed illa ei tunc uti non licet, verum modo interiore; causae sunt plures: prima est, quae dicta, quod ex memoria 
interiore (o)in altera vita loqui et conversari possit cum omnibus in universo: secunda, quod haec memoria propria sit spiritus, et adaequata ejus statui in quo tunc est; nam exteriora, nempe scientifica, 
mundana et corporea adaequata sunt homini, et correspondent ejus statui, cum est in mundo et corpore; at vero interiora, nempe rationalia, spiritualia et caelestia, adaequata sunt et correspondeat 
spiritui. </p>
