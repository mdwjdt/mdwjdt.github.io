<h3 align="center" class="ired">属天的奥秘 第1110节</h3>
<h4 align="center"></h4><p><strong>1110.</strong>有些人认为公义和功劳全赖他们有良好的行为，因此将救恩的果效归于自己，而不是归于主及其公义和功劳，而且，这些人已在思维和生活中确认这种信念，在来生，其虚假信念转化为幻觉，他们觉得自己似乎在劈柴，这恰是他们的写照。我与他们进行交谈。当时他们忙于干活，对于问及是否感觉疲劳的问题，他们回答说，他们还没有完成足够的工作，能够值得上天堂。当他们正在劈柴的时候，似乎有点像主的东西显现在柴下，那木头就如同他们正在赚取的功劳一样。似乎在木块里的东西越像主，他们呆在那个状态里的时间就越持久。不过，当这个表象开始停止时，他们就渐渐地接近消磨的尾声。最终，他们也能够被允许进入善的社群，尽管他们仍然长时间在真与假之间摇摆。因为他们过着循规蹈矩的生活，因而主给与他们很大的照顾，时常派遣天使到他们那里去。这些人在犹太教会被描绘为“劈柴”（约书亚记<a href="http://39-27.cn/书9.23.htm">9:23</a>，<a href="http://39-27.cn/书9.27.htm">27</a>）。</p>

<p><strong>[NCE]1110.</strong> Some people had claimed that good deeds would make them virtuous and earn them credit, and in this way they assigned to themselves — not to the Lord and his virtue and merit — the ability to achieve salvation. They had hardened this idea in themselves by the way they thought and the way they lived. In the other life, their misguided assumptions turn into hallucinations, in which they seem to themselves to be cutting wood; this is exactly how it appears to them. I have talked with them; and if asked while at their work whether they are tired, they answer that they have not yet done enough work to earn heaven.<br />While they are cutting wood, it appears as though something of the Lord lies under the logs, so that the wood is the merit. The more of the Lord there is in the pieces of wood, the longer they remain woodcutters, but when it begins to vanish, the period of devastation is drawing to its close.<br />Finally they arrive at a point where they can be allowed into good communities, but for a long time they continue to go back and forth between a true idea and a false one. Because they have lived a devout life, they are objects of particular care to the Lord, and he repeatedly sends them angels.<br />These are the ones who were represented in the Jewish religion by the woodcutters in <a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_1110/bible_king-james-version_joshua_9_23" target=_top>Joshua 9:23</a>, <a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_1110/bible_king-james-version_joshua_9_27" target=_top>27</a>. </p>

Those who have assumed righteousness and merit on account of their good works, and so have attributed the efficacy of salvation to themselves, and not to the Lord and His righteousness and merit, and 
have confirmed themselves in this in thought and in life, in the other world have their principles of falsity turned into phantasies, so that they seem to themselves to be hewing wood: this is exactly 
as it appears to them. I have spoken with them. When they are engaged in their labor, and are asked whether they are not fatigued, they reply that they have not yet accomplished enough work to be able 
to merit heaven. When they are hewing the wood there appears to be something of the Lord under the wood, thus as if the wood were merit that they are getting. The more of the Lord there appears in 
the wood, the longer they remain in this condition; but when that appearance begins to cease, their vastation is drawing to an end. At length they become such that they too can be admitted into good societies, 
but still they long fluctuate between truth and falsity. Great care is taken of them by the Lord, because they have lived a dutiful life, and He from time to time sends angels to them. These 
are they who in the Jewish Church were represented by the hewers of wood (Josh. 9:23, 27). </p>

People who have assumed that righteousness and merit lay in their good works and so have attributed the power of achieving salvation to themselves, not to the Lord and to His  righteousness and merit, 
and who in thought and life have confirmed themselves in this idea, have their assumptions converted in the next life into delusions in which they seem to themselves to be cutting wood. This is exactly 
how it appears to them. I have spoken to them. When they are doing their work and are asked whether they are not tired out, they reply that they have not yet done enough work to be able to merit heaven. 
While they are cutting pieces of wood it seems as though something of the Lord is underneath the wood, so that the wood appears as merit. And the more something of the Lord seems to be in the pieces 
of wood the longer they remain in that condition. But when this delusion starts to fade they are getting nearer the end of vastation. At length they become such that they too are able to be admitted 
into good communities, though they still waver for a long time between truth and falsity. Because they have led a conscientious life the Lord takes great care of them, and is sending angels to them 
time and again. These are the people who in the Jewish Church were represented by 'hewers of wood', <a href="http://bible.gospelcom.net/cgi-bin/bible?passage=Josh%209:23,%2027&amp;version=ESV&amp;interface=print&amp;showfn=yes&amp;showxref">Josh 9:23, 27</a>. </p>

</p><b>1110.</b>
Qui in bonis operibus justitiam et meritum posuerunt ac ita sibi tribuerunt efficaciam salvationis, non Domino ac Ipsius justitiae et merito, seque in eo confirmarunt cogitatione et vita, eorum principia 
falsi vertuntur in altera vita in phantasias, quod videantur sibi scindere ligna, ita prorsus iis apparet; cum iis locutus sum: cum in labore suo sunt, et interrogantur annon defatigentur, respondent 
quod nondum tantum laboris egerint ut possint mereri caelum.  Apparet, cum ligna scindunt, quasi quid Domini sub lignis, sic ut lignum sit meritum; quo plus Domini in lignis, eo diutius tales manent; 
at cum hoc incipit disparari, tunc tendit ad finem vastationis:  tandem fiunt tales ut quoque admitti in societates bonas possint, sed usque fluctuant diu inter verum et falsum:  illorum, quia piam 
egerunt vitam, curam multam Dominus habet; et ad eos subinde mittit angelos.  Hi sunt qui in Ecclesia Judaica repraesentati sunt per 'sectores lignorum,' Jos. ix 23, 27. </p>
