<h4 align="center"></h4><p><strong>7747.</strong>后来，这些火星灵从上面流入我的脸。这种流注感觉就像一阵细条状的雨，这表明他们没有对真理和良善的情感；因为这种流注是以某种条纹状的东西来代表的。这时，他们公开与我交谈，说，他们星球的居民以同样的方式（即以别人理解的方式）彼此交谈。于是，我告诉他们，这样说话是不好的，因为这样做，他们就会阻塞内在事物，从内在事物退到外在事物，然后剥夺外在事物的生命；尤其因为这样说话是不诚实的。事实上，那些诚实的人不愿说，甚至不愿想任何事，除非他们想让其他人，就是所有人，甚至整个天堂都知道这事。而那些不愿让其他人知道他们说什么的人，其实是对别人评头论足，对别人的看法是不好的，对自己的看法是好的，并最终形成这样一种习惯，他们对教会、天堂，甚至主自己的思想和言论都不好。</p>

Afterward the spirits of Mars inflowed from above into my face. The influx felt like a light rain falling in streaks, which was a sign that they were not in the affection of truth and good, for this 
is represented by what is streaked. They then spoke plainly with me, saying that the inhabitants of their earth so speak with one another. They were then told that this is evil, because in this way they 
obstruct internal things, and recede from them to external ones, which they also deprive of their life; and especially because it is not sincere to speak so, for they who are sincere do not wish to 
speak or even think anything which others may not know, yea, all others, and even the whole heaven; whereas they who are not willing that others should know what they speak, pass judgment on others, 
think ill of them and well of themselves, and at last contract such a habit that they think and speak ill even of the church, of heaven, nay, of the Lord Himself. </p>

After this the Martian spirits flowed from above onto my face. The flow felt like thin streaks of rain, which was a sign that they did not have an affection for truth and good; for this is what something 
streaked represents. They now spoke to me plainly, saying that the inhabitants of their planet talk to one another in a similar manner [unintelligible to others]. I then told them that this was bad, 
because by acting in that way they block off inner thoughts and feelings and forsake them for outward ones, and then deprive those outward ones of their life too; and especially because there is no 
honesty in speaking in that kind of way. For those who are honest are unwilling to say or even think anything unless they are willing to let others know it, indeed all others, even the whole of heaven. 
But those who are not willing to allow others to know what they say pass judgement on others, they have a poor opinion of others and a good one of themselves, and at length, because they behave in 
that way habitually, they go so far as to think and speak ill even of the Church, heaven, and yes the Lord Himself. </p>

</p><b>7747.</b>
Postea influebant spiritus Martis a superiore in faciem meam; influxus sentiebatur instar tenuis pluviae striatae, quod signum erat quod non in affectione veri ac boni essent, id enim per striatum {1}repraesentatur; 
loquebantur tunc mecum manifeste, dicendo quod incolae telluris illorum similiter inter se loquantur.  Dicebatur tunc illis quod hoc malum sit, quia sic obstruunt interna et ab illis 
recedunt ad externa, quae quoque privant sua vita, et imprimis quia non sincerum est ita loqui; nam qui sinceri sunt nihil volunt loqui, ne quidem cogitare, nisi tale quod sciant alii, immo si forent 
omnes, etiam totum caelum; at qui non volunt ut alii sciant quid loquuntur, illi judicant de aliis, male sentiunt de illis, et bene de se, et tandem ex habitu trahuntur usque illuc ut male sentiant et 
loquantur etiam de Ecclesia, de caelo, immo de Ipso Domino. 	@1 significatur$
