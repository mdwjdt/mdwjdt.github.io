And the valley of Siddim was pit after pit of tar; and the king of Sodom and [the king] of Gomorrah fled and fell there, and the rest fled into the mountain.<br />The valley of Siddim was pit after pit of tar symbolizes dirty lies and dirty cravings. And the king of Sodom and [the king] of Gomorrah fled and fell there means that those evils and falsities were conquered. And the rest fled into the mountain means that not all of them were; a mountain is self-love and materialism. </p>
<p align="center"><b>Potts(1905-1910) 1687</b></p><p><b>1687.</b>
Verse 10. And the valley of Siddim was pits, pits [or, full of pits] of bitumen; and the king of Sodom and of Gomorrah fled, and fell there, and they that remained fled to the mountain. "The valley of 
Siddim was pits, pits, of bitumen," signifies the uncleanness of the falsities and cupidities; "and the king of Sodom and of Gomorrah fled, and fell there," signifies that those evils and falsities 
were overcome; "and they that remained fled to the mountain," signifies but not all of them; "the mountain" is the love of self and of the world. </p>

Verse 10 And the valley of Siddim was pits after pits of bitumen; and the king of Sodom and [the king] of Gomorrah fled, and they fell there; and the rest fled to the mountain. </p>
<p>'The valley of Siddim 
was pits after pits of bitumen' means the uncleanness of falsities and evil desires 'And the king of Sodom and {the king] of Gomorrah fled, and they fell there' means that those evils and falsities 
were overcome 'And the rest fled to the mountain' means that it did not happen to all of them, 'a mountain' meaning self-love and love of the world. </p>

</p><b>1687.</b>
Vers.  10.  Et vallis Siddim putei putei bituminis; et fugerunt rex Sodomae et Amorae, et ceciderunt ibi, et residui in montem fugerunt. 'Vallis Siddim putei putei bituminis' significat immundum falsitatum 
et cupiditatum: 'et fugerunt rex Sodomae et Amorae, et ceciderunt ibi' significat quod mala et falsa illa victa: 'et residui i montem fugerunt' significat quod non omnes; 'mons' est amor si et mundi. </p>
