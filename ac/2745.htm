<h3 align="center" class="ired">属天的奥秘 第2745节</h3>
<h4 align="center"></h4><p><strong>2745.</strong>有的女人不爱自己的丈夫，反而看不起他们，最终不拿他们当回事。她们的品性向我显为一只公鸡、一只野猫和一只深色老虎。据说，这种女人先是喋喋不休，然后开始责骂，最后披上老虎的性质。有的说，这种女人仍爱自己的孩子，但得到的回答是，这种爱不是人的，它同样流入恶者里面，甚至流入各种动物，并且如此强烈，以致它们也爱自己的后代胜过爱自己。有人补充说，这类人没有丝毫婚姻之爱。</p>

There are women who do not love their husbands, but hold them in contempt, and at length esteem them as of no account. Their quality was represented to me by a cock, a wild cat, and a tiger of a dark 
color. It was said that such begin by talking much, and then proceed to scolding, and at length put on the nature of the tiger. It was said by some that such still love their children; but it was answered 
that such love is not human, and that it flows equally into the evil, and even into animals of whatever kind, to such a degree that these also love their offspring more than themselves. It was added 
that with such persons there is nothing of conjugial love. </p>

There are women who do not love their husbands but despise them, and at length value them as good-for-nothings. The character of these women was represented to me by a cock, a wild cat, and a dark-coloured 
tiger. I was told that such women start off by talking a lot, go on to scolding, and at length assume the nature of the tiger. It was stated by some that such women nevertheless love their children, 
but the reply was made that this love is not human, and that it flows equally into the evil, and even into all types of living creatures, so much so that these also love their offspring more than 
themselves. It was added that nothing of conjugial love resides with such as these. </p>

Sunt quae non amant maritos, sed eos vilipendunt, et tandem pro nihilo aestimant; quales illae sunt, repraesentatum est per gallum, felem silvestrem, et tigridem obscuri coloris; dictum quod tales incipiant 
multum loqui, dein increpare, et tandem tigridis naturam induunt; dicebatur a quibusdam quod tales usque amant liberos, at responsum quod amor ille non sit humanus, et quod influat aeque in malos, 
etiam in animalia quaecumque, usque adeo ut quoque haec ament prolem prae se; adjiciebatur quod apud tales nihil amoris conjugialis sit. </p>
