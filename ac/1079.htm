<h3 align="center" class="ired">属天的奥秘 第1079节</h3>
<h4 align="center"></h4><p><strong>1079.</strong>“看见他父亲赤身”表他发现错误和堕落。这一点从“赤身”的含义清楚看出来，刚才和前面（<a href="213.htm">213</a>，<a href="214.htm">214</a>节）已说明，“赤身”是罪恶和堕落。此处用“含看见他父亲赤身”，即他发现错误和堕落来描述那些将信与仁分开的人。这种人只看到人里面的错误和堕落；而那些拥有仁之信的人则迥然不同，他们只会发现良善，即使看到恶与假，他们也会原谅之，并尽可能努力纠正他的这些恶与假，如此处所论及的闪和雅弗。<br />哪里没有仁爱，哪里就有我欲，因而有对一切不偏向自己之人的仇恨。结果，他们只看到邻人的邪恶。即使看到良善，他们要么将它贬得一无是处，要么对它进行恶意解读。而那些拥有仁爱之人则完全不同。这两种人凭着仁爱的有无而彼此有别。尤其进入来生后，对那些缺乏仁爱的人而言，仇恨的感觉从每一样事物中迸发出来；他们渴望检查每个人，甚至审判他。他们只想找出罪恶，总是惦记着谴责、惩罚和折磨。但那些拥有仁爱之人则几乎看不到别人的邪恶，反而会发现他的一切善与真，并对他的恶与假作善意的解释。所有天使都是这样，他们从将一切恶折向善的主那里获得这种性情。</p>

<p><strong>[NCE]1079.</strong> The fact that he saw his father's nakedness means that they observed errors and perversions is established by the symbolism of nakedness as that which is evil and perverted, discussed just above, as well as earlier, in <a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_1079/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_213" target=_top>213</a>, <a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_1079/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_214" target=_top>214</a>.<br />People who adopt faith separated from charity are depicted here by Ham and the notice he took of his father's nakedness, that is, of his father's errors and perversions. Those are the only things that people like this can see in another individual. But it is different for people who have the faith that comes of charity. They take notice of good qualities. Whatever evil or falsity they may see, they excuse it, and if they can, they work to correct it in the offender, as the present passage says Shem and Japheth did.<br />[2] Where neighborly love is absent, self-love is present, along with hatred for anyone who does not cater to oneself. That is why people who lack neighborly love see nothing in their neighbor besides that neighbor's evil. If they see anything good in the person, they either dismiss it or put a bad interpretation on it.<br />People governed by charity act in an entirely different way.<br />These differences form the distinction between the two types of people, particularly when they enter the other life. Those who lack all kindness radiate hatred from every pore. They want to examine and in fact judge everyone and crave nothing more than to find evil, constantly bent as they are on condemning, punishing, and torturing others.<br />Those who are guided by kindness, on the other hand, hardly even notice evil in another but pay attention instead to everything good and true in the person. When they do find anything bad or false, they put a good interpretation on it. This is a characteristic of all angels — one they acquire from the Lord, who bends everything bad toward good. </p>

Saw the nakedness of his father. That this signifies that he observed the errors and perversions, is evident from the signification of "nakedness" (concerning which see just above, and also before at 
n. 213, 214), as being what is evil and perverted. Here, those who are in faith separated from charity are described by "Ham" in his "seeing the nakedness of his father" that is, his errors and perversions; 
for they who are of this character see nothing else in a man; whereas-very differently-those who are in the faith of charity observe what is good, and if they see anything evil and false, they 
excuse it, and if they can, try to amend it in him, as is here said of Shem and Japheth. Where there is no charity, there is the love of self, and therefore hatred against all who do not favor self. 
Consequently such persons see in the neighbor only what is evil, and if they see anything good, they either perceive it as nothing, or put a bad interpretation upon it. It is just the other way with those 
who are in charity. By this difference these two kinds of men are distinguished from one another, especially when they come into the other life; for then with those who are in no charity, the feeling 
of hatred shines forth from every single thing; they desire to examine everyone, and even to judge him; nor do they desire anything more than to find out what is evil, constantly cherishing the disposition 
to condemn, punish, and torment. But they who are in charity scarcely see the evil of another, but observe all his goods and truths, and put a good interpretation on what is evil and false. 
Such are all the angels, which they have from the Lord, who bends all evil into good. </p>

<p align="center"><b>Elliott(1983-1999) 1079</b></p><p><b>1079.</b>
'He saw his father's nakedness' means that he noticed the errors and perversities. This becomes clear from the meaning of 'nakedness', dealt with just above and also previously in <a href="213.htm">213</a>, <a href="214.htm">214</a>, as evil and 
perversity. Here Ham's noticing his father's nakedness, that is, his errors and perversities, describes people with whom faith is separated from charity. Such people see nothing else but errors and 
perversities residing with a person. But those who have faith that inheres in charity are different. They notice the goods, and if they do see evils and falsities they excuse them, and if possible endeavour 
with that person to correct them, as is said here of Shem and Japheth.  </p>

<p><b>[2]</b>
 Where charity does not exist self-love is present and consequently hatred towards all who do not show favour to self. 
As a result they see in the neighbour nothing except his evil. Or if they do see anything good they either perceive it as nothing or else place a bad interpretation on it. It is altogether otherwise 
with those with whom charity is present. And from such presence or absence of charity these two kinds of people are distinguished from each other. Especially when they enter the next life, with those 
who have no charity, a feeling of hatred is manifest in every single thing; they wish to try everyone and indeed to pass judgement on them. Their one desire is to discover what is evil in them, all 
the time having it in mind to condemn, punish, and torment. But those who have charity hardly notice the evil in another person, but instead notice all the goods and truths that are his; and on his 
evils and falsities they place a good interpretation. Of such a nature are all angels, it being something they have from the Lord, who bends everything evil into good. </p>

</p><b>1079.</b>
Quod 'vidit nuditatem patris sui' significet quod observaverit errores et perversa, constare potest a significatione 'nuditatis,' de qua mox supra, tum prius n. 213, 214, quod sit malum et perversum. 
 Hic describuntur ii qui in fide separata a charitate sunt per 'Ham, quod nuditatem patris sui observaverit,' hoc est, quod errores et perversa ejus; qui tales sunt, nihil aliud apud hominem vident; 
at qui in fide charitatis aliter, ii observant bona, et si quae mala et falsa vident, ea excusant, et si possunt, apud eum emendare student, sicut hic dicitur de Shemo et Japheto.  [2] Ubi nulla charitas, 
ibi est amor sui, proinde odium contra omnes qui non sibi favent; inde est quod non videant apud proximum quam ejus malum et si quid bonum, id vel percipiunt sicut nullum, vel interpretantur in 
malum: prorsus aliter qui in charitate sunt: dignoscuntur bina haec hominum genera inde; imprimis quando in alteram vitam veniunt, apud eos qui in nulla charitate sunt, animus odii tunc ex singulis elucet, 
unumquemvis volunt examinare, immo judicare, nec quicquam plus cupiunt quam invenire malum, continue gerentes animo condemnare, punire et cruciare: at qui in charitate sunt, hi vix malum alterius 
vident, sed omnia ejus bona et vera observant, et quae mala et falsa sunt, in bonum interpretantur; tales sunt omnes angeli, quod habent a Domino, Qui omne malum in bonum flectit. </p>
