<h4 align="center"></h4><p><strong>831.</strong>有些女人只为满足自己的属世倾向而活着，只关心自己和这个世界，将整个生活及其快乐专注在表面的端庄得体上。因此，她们在上流社会受到尊崇。她们通过行为习惯获得这样的能力：即假装高尚进入别人的欲望和乐趣，但目的是控制他们。所以她们的生活是虚假和欺骗的生活。她们和其他人一样经常到教堂去，但只是为了表现自己的高尚和虔诚。此外，她们没有良知，并且只要不被发现，非常倾向于无耻行径和通奸。在来生，这类女人还是这样思想，不知道何为良知，并嘲笑那些提及良知的人。她们通过欺骗手段，就是假装高尚、虔诚、仁慈和纯真来侵占别人的情感，无论是何等样的情感。当外在约束被除去后，她们就冲进最可憎、最令人作呕的事物中。<br />在来生，这些女人会变成妖妇或女巫，其中有些被称为塞壬（古希腊神话中半人半鸟或半人半鱼的女海妖，以美妙歌声诱使航海者驶向礁石或进入危险水域）。她们还会获得世上所不知的戏法，象海绵一样吸收邪恶的伎俩，并极具天赋，能很快将其付诸实践。她们在灵界学到的戏法是世上闻所未闻的，其中包括：她们能仿佛在另一个地方说话，以至于她们的声音在那个地方听上去象是出自善灵；她们似乎还能与很多人同时在一起，并以此使其他人相信她们仿佛无处不在；她们能同时以数个人，并且同时在数个地方说话；她们会转变善灵所流入的一切，甚至天使灵所流入的一切，以种种方式立刻将其扭曲为适合她们自己的东西；她们能通过所采用和塑造的某个人的想法而模仿他；她们能通过进入别人的情感状态而将对她们自己的情感植入到这个人里面；她们能偷偷溜出视线而不被发觉；她们能在精灵们眼前呈现出头上的白色火焰，就是天使的标志，而且能当着很多人的面这样做；她们能以种种方式乔装无辜，甚至显示为所亲吻的婴儿；她们还能煽动所恨的人杀死她们（因为她们知道自己不会死），然后公开指控他们犯有谋杀罪。<br />她们曾从我的记忆中唤起我所思想和做过的恶事，手段高超无比。她们在我沉睡时与别人说话，好象这些话出自我本人，结果精灵们信以为真，而事实上都是些虚假和恶心的东西。除此之外，她们还有很多其它手段。其本性如此具有说服力，以至于毫无怀疑的余地。这就是为何她们的观念不象其他精灵的那样被交流的原因。她们的眼睛可以说就象蛇的眼睛，一眼就能注意到各个方向。这些女巫或塞壬会受到严惩，有的在火坑中，有的在蛇群中的宫廷里；有的被肢解和殴打，伴随着最大的痛苦和折磨。随着时间推移，她们与所有社群隔离，从头到脚变得像骷髅。本章末尾将继续阐述这一主题。</p>

<p><strong>[NCE]831.</strong> There are women who lived a life of indulgence, focusing their energies on themselves and the world and centering their whole lives and all the pleasure of life on external decorum. As a result polite society valued them more than others. From practice and habit they learned to behave in socially acceptable ways in order to tap into others' desires and sensual pleasures. This they did under a pretense of respectability but with the desire to control. Consequently their lives became a sham and a lie. They attended church just as others did, but for no reason except to appear honorable and devout. Furthermore, they lacked any conscience and were very much drawn to immoral and adulterous conduct, so far as it could be kept hidden.<br />Their thinking remains the same in the next life. What a conscience is they do not know, and they scoff at people who use the word. They get inside others' feelings, whatever those may be, simulating honesty, piety, mercy, and innocence, and using these as covers for deception. Whenever outward restraints are removed from them, they plunge into the most criminal obscenities.<br />[2] In the other life, these women become sorceresses or witches, some of whom are called sirens.{*1} There they eagerly take up arts unknown in the world. They are like sponges that soak up wicked and cunning methods, for which they have such a talent that they put them directly into practice. The stratagems unknown in this world that they learn there are these:<br />They can throw their voices, so that it seems as though the sound were coming from good spirits somewhere else.<br />They can seem to be with several people at once, convincing others that they are present almost everywhere.<br />They can speak as though they were many people talking simultaneously and in many places at once.<br />They can deflect what flows in from good spirits and even from angelic ones and immediately twist it to their own advantage in a variety of ways.<br />They can impersonate another by seizing on the person's patterns of thought and mimicking them.<br />They can induce affection for themselves in anyone by worming their way into the actual emotions the person is feeling.<br />They can suddenly drop out of sight and turn invisible.<br />They can create the appearance of a dazzling white flame — the sign of an angel — around their head, and this in front of a large number of spirits.<br />They have different ways of pretending innocence, even causing babies to appear and kissing them.<br />And they inspire the people they hate to kill them (since they know they cannot die) and then publicly accuse them of being murderers.<br />[3] In my case, using consummate skill they dredged up out of my memory everything bad that I had ever thought or done. While I was sleeping, they talked to others exactly as if I were speaking, managing to dupe those spirits; and what they said was false and lewd. They have many other devices as well.<br />Their nature is so persuasive that not a trace of hesitation can be detected in it. For this reason their thoughts are not shared generally, as other spirits' thoughts are. Their eyes are like snakes' eyes, as people say, looking everywhere and projecting mental images in all directions.<br />These witches or sirens are punished severely, some in Gehenna, some surrounded by snakes in a kind of assembly hall. The punishment of some consists in being torn apart and buffeted in various ways, with the greatest pain and anguish. After a while they are ostracized and turn into seeming skeletons from head to toe.<br />More on this subject follows at the end of the chapter [<a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_831/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_938" target=_top>938-946</a>]. </p>
<p align="center"><b>Potts(1905-1910) 831</b></p><p><b>831.</b>
There are women who have lived in the indulgence of their natural inclinations, caring only for themselves and the world, and making the whole of life and the delight of life to consist in outward decorum, 
in consequence of which they have been highly esteemed in polite society. They have thus, by practice and habit, acquired the talent of insinuating themselves into the desires and pleasures of 
others, under the pretense of what is honorable, but with the purpose of gaining control over them. Their life therefore became one of dissimulation and deceit. Like others they frequented churches, but 
for no other end than that they might appear virtuous and pious; and moreover they were without conscience, and very prone to shameful acts and adulteries, so far as these could be concealed. Such 
women think in the same way in the other life, knowing not what conscience is, and ridiculing those who speak of it. They enter into the affections of others, whatever these may be, by simulating virtue, 
piety, pity, and innocence, which are their means of deceiving; but whenever outward restraints are removed, they rush into things most wicked and obscene.  [2] These are the women who become enchantresses 
or sorceresses in the other life, some of whom are those called Sirens; and they there become expert in arts unknown in the world. They are like sponges that imbibe nefarious artifices; and 
are of such talent that they quickly put them in practice. The arts unknown in this world which they learn in the other are these. They can speak as though they were in another place, so that their voice 
is heard there as from good spirits. They can as it were be with many at the same time, thus persuading others that they are as if present everywhere. They can speak as several persons at the same 
time, and in several places at the same time. They can turn aside what flows in from good spirits, even what flows in from angelic spirits, and in diverse ways pervert it instantly in favor of themselves. 
They can put on the likeness of another, by the ideas of him which they conceive and fashion. They can inspire anyone with an affection for themselves, by insinuating themselves into the very state 
of another's affection. They can withdraw suddenly out of sight, and escape unseen. They can represent before the eyes of spirits a white flame about the head, which is an angelic sign, and this 
before many. They can in diverse ways feign innocence, even by representing infants whom they kiss. They also excite others, whom they hate, to kill them (for they know they cannot die), and then divulge 
it and accuse them of murder.  [3] They have called up out of my memory whatever of evil I have thought and done, and this most skillfully. While I was asleep they have talked with others, just as 
if from me, so that the spirits were persuaded of it, thus of things false and obscene. And many other arts they have. Their nature is so persuasive that no room is left therein for any doubt; therefore 
their ideas are not communicated like those of other spirits. And their eyes are like those ascribed to serpents, seeing and paying attention every way at once. These sorceresses or sirens are grievously 
punished, some in Gehenna, some in a kind of court among snakes; some by wrenchings and various collisions, attended with the greatest pain and torture. In course of time they are separated from 
all society and become like skeletons from head to foot. A continuation of the subject follows at the end of the chapter.      </p>
<p>CHAPTER 8.      1. And God remembered Noah, and every wild animal, 
and every beast that was with him in the ark; and God made a wind to pass over the earth, and the waters assuaged.      2. The fountains also of the deep, and the cataracts of heaven were stopped, 
and the rain from heaven was restrained.      3. And the waters receded from off the earth, going and returning; and after the end of a hundred and fifty days the waters failed.      4. And the ark 
rested in the seventh month, on the seventeenth day of the month, upon the mountains of Ararat.      5. And the waters were going and failing until the tenth month; in the tenth month, on the first day 
of the month, the tops of the mountains appeared. * * * * * * * *      6. And it came to pass at the end of forty days, that Noah opened the window of the ark which he had made: </p>
<p>     7. And he sent 
forth a raven, and it went forth, going and returning, until the waters were dried up from off the earth.      8. And he sent forth a dove from him, to see if the waters were abated from off the 
faces of the ground.      9. And the dove found no rest for the sole of her foot, and she returned unto him to the ark, for the waters were on the faces of the whole earth; and he put forth his hand 
and took her, and brought her in unto him into the ark.      10. And he stayed yet other seven days; and again he sent forth the dove out of the ark; </p>
<p>     11. And the dove came back to him at eventide; 
and lo in her mouth an olive leaf plucked off; so Noah knew that the waters were abated from off the earth.      12. And he stayed yet other seven days, and sent forth the dove, and she returned 
not again unto him anymore.      13. And it came to pass in the six hundred and first year, in the beginning, on the first of the month, that the waters were dried up from off the earth; and Noah removed 
the covering of the ark, and saw, and behold, the faces of the ground were dry. * * * * * * * *      14. In the second month, on the seven and twentieth day of the month, was the earth dry.   
   15. And God spake unto Noah, saying,       16. Go forth from the ark, thou and thy wife, and thy sons, and thy sons' wives with thee.      17. Every wild animal that is with thee of all flesh, as 
to fowl, and as to beast, and as to every creeping thing that creepeth upon the earth, bring forth with thee, that they may spread themselves in the earth, and be fruitful, and multiply upon the earth.  
    18. And Noah went forth, and his sons, and his wife, and his sons' wives with him.      19. Every wild animal, every creeping thing, and every fowl, everything that creepeth upon the earth, 
according to their families, went forth out of the ark. * * * * * * * *      20. And Noah builded an altar unto Jehovah; and took of every clean beast, and of every clean fowl, and offered burnt offerings 
on the altar.      21. And Jehovah smelled an odor of rest; and Jehovah said in His heart, I will not again curse the ground anymore on man's account; because the imagination of man's heart is 
evil from his youth; neither will I again smite anymore everything living, as I have done.      22. During all the days of the earth, seed time and harvest, and cold and heat, and summer and winter, 
and day and night, shall not cease. </p>

There are women who have lived to satisfy their own inclinations. They have studied solely themselves and the world, and have focused the whole of life and its enjoyment in being outwardly respectable. 
Consequently in social circles they have been esteemed above other women. By the way they have behaved and conducted themselves they have acquired the ability to worm their way, by being outwardly 
respectable, into other people's desires and pleasures. They have employed a pretence to being honourable, but their aim has been to gain control over others. As a result their lives have become those 
of sham and deceit. Like other people they have gone to Church, but with no other end in view than giving the appearance of being honourable and devout. Furthermore they have been devoid of conscience, 
strongly inclined to behaving disgracefully and committing adultery insofar as it was possible to do so without being found out. Such women go on thinking in the same way in the next life. They do 
not know what conscience is and they laugh at people who mention it. They encroach upon whatever affections other people may have through their pretence of honourableness, devoutness, mercy, and innocence, 
which with them are instruments for deception. And whenever external restraints are removed from them, they rush into the most abominable and disgusting practices. </p>
<p></p>
<p><b>[2]</b>
 These are women who in 
the next life become sorceresses or witches. Some of them are those called sirens. In that life they acquire tricks unknown in the world. They are like sponges that soak up unmentionable tricks, and are 
so clever that they quickly put them into practice. The tricks which they learn in that world and are unknown in this include their ability to speak as though they are somewhere else, so that their 
voice is heard as if coming from good spirits in that other place. They have the ability to appear to be with many people simultaneously, and in this way convince others that they can appear to be present 
everywhere. They have the ability to speak as if they were various persons simultaneously, and in various places simultaneously. They have the ability to turn aside what is flowing in from good 
spirits, even what is flowing in from angelic spirits, and to change that instantly and in different ways into what suits themselves. They have the ability to impersonate somebody else by means of his 
ideas which they adopt and give shape to. They can inspire an affection for themselves into somebody else by worming their way into the very slate of the other person's affections. They can steal away 
suddenly out of sight, without being noticed. They can exhibit before the eyes of spirits a bright flame around their head, which is an angelic sign, doing so in the presence of many. They can feign 
innocence in various ways, even by exhibiting infants whom they are caressing. They can also incite others whom they hate to kill them - for they know that they cannot die - and afterwards publicly accuse 
them of being murderers.  </p>
<p></p>
<p><b>[3]</b>
 They have called forth from my memory whatever evil I have thought or committed, doing so in a most expert fashion. When I was asleep they have spoken to others 
just as if the words came from myself, with the result that spirits were convinced of it, and indeed things that were false and disgusting. And there are many other practices in addition to these. The 
nature of these women is so persuasive that they leave one with no feeling of doubt. This is why their ideas are not communicated as those of other spirits are. And their eyes are, so to speak, like 
those of a snake, having a vision of and noting things in every direction at once. These witches or sirens are punished severely. Some are in Gehenna; some in a kind of court among snakes; some are punished 
by being ripped apart, and by various beatings, accompanied by very great pain and torment. In the process of time they are separated from one another and come to look like skeletons from head 
to toe. A continuation of this subject follows at the end of the chapter. </p>
