<h3 align="center" class="ired">属天的奥秘 第2243节</h3>
<h4 align="center"></h4><p><strong>2243.</strong>“他们是否真的像那达到我这里的嚷叫声一样完结；若是不然，我也必知道”表邪恶是否达到顶点。这从“嚷叫声”的含义清楚可知，“嚷叫声”是指虚假，如刚才所解释的（<a href="2240.htm">2240</a>节）。那里（末尾）说到，虚假有两种，即出于邪恶的虚假和制造邪恶的虚假。出于邪恶的虚假就是人屈服于邪恶时所思的一切，也就是支持邪恶的一切。如，人在行淫时对于行淫所思的一切，那时他认为行淫是可以的，是正当和得体的，是生活的快乐，它还有利于后代的出生等等。所有这些想法都是出于邪恶的虚假。<br />但是，当人根据其宗教信仰坚信某个信条，并因此相信它是善的或神圣的，而事实上它本身是邪恶的时，制造邪恶的虚假就会产生。如，人若根据其宗教信仰相信某个人能施行拯救，并因此敬拜并尊崇他，就是出于那虚假行恶。这同样适用于其它本为虚假的宗教信仰。由于虚假既来自邪恶，又制造邪恶，故此处使用“嚷叫声”这个词，它作为一般术语表示它所包含之物，即邪恶。这也可从经上说“它们是否真的像那达到我这里的嚷叫声一样完结”明显可知。在这里，“它的嚷叫声”用的是单数形式，“它们完结”用的是复数形式。<br />第一卷（<a href="1857.htm">1857</a>节）说明了何为“完结”（consummation或译为结局，终结，满了，终止，满盈等）。我们可通过诸教会来进一步理解何为一个完结。被称作“人”的上古教会是最为属天的，但随着时间推移，它从爱之善中衰退，以致最终无一丝属天之物存留。这时，它的完结就到来了，这完结以大洪水前之人的状态来描述。<br />大洪水后名为“挪亚”的古教会不那么属天，随着时间推移，它也远离仁之善，以致无一丝仁爱存留，因为它部分转化为巫术，部分转化为偶像崇拜，部分则转化为脱离仁爱的教义体系。这时，它的完结就到来了。<br />然后，名为希伯来教会的又一个教会随之兴起，其属天和属灵的程度更次之。该教会甚至将些许神圣敬拜置于外在仪式，并随着时间推移以种种方式被败坏，而这类外在敬拜则转化成偶像崇拜。这时，它的完结到来了。<br />接着，第四个教会在雅各的后代中被恢复，该教会没有任何属天和属灵之物，仅仅是它的一个代表。故它是一个代表属天和属灵之物的教会，因为他们不知道自己的仪式代表和表示什么。但它得以建立，是为了世人和天堂之间仍有某种诸如善与真的代表物之间，以及善与真本身之间所存在的那种联结。这个教会最终也沦落到虚假和邪恶中，以致一切仪式都变成了偶像崇拜。这时，它的完结也到来了。<br />因此，接连不断的教会就这样衰落，当到了它们当中最后一个教会时，人类与天堂之间的联结完全被切断，以致人类就要灭亡，因为提供这种联结和纽带的教会不存在了（参看<a href="468.htm">468</a>，<a href="637.htm">637</a>，<a href="931.htm">931</a>，<a href="2054.htm">2054</a>节）。此时，主降临世间，并凭祂自己里面神性本质与人性本质的融合而将天与地联结起来，同时又建立了一个被称为基督教会的新教会。该教会起初也处于信之善，其成员彼此如兄弟般生活在仁爱中，但随着时间流逝，它已经向各个方向偏离，如今竟到了其成员甚至不知道信的根本就是对主之爱和对邻之仁的地步。尽管他们凭教义声称主是人类的救主，他们死后会复活，有天堂和地狱的存在，然而却很少有人相信。由于该教会已然如此，故它的完结为期不远了。<br />所有这一切表明何为“完结”（consummation或译为结局，终结，满了，终止，满盈等），即它就是邪恶达到顶点之时。具体情况，即每个人的情形也一样。至于具体的每个人的完结是何情形，蒙主怜悯，我将在下文告知。完结（consummation或译为结局，终结，满了，终止，满盈等）在圣言各处都有所论述，在此之前的状态则被描述为随“造访”而来的“荒废”和“荒凉”。</p>

Whether they have made a consummation according to the cry of it which is come unto Me, and if not I will know. That this signifies whether evil has arrived at its height, is evident from the signification 
of a "cry," as being falsity (explained just above, n. 2240). As there said (near the end) there are two kinds of falsity, namely, the falsity which is from evil, and the falsity which produces 
evil. The falsity which is from evil is all that which a man thinks when he is in evil, namely, all that favors his evil; as for example, when he is in adultery, that which he then thinks about adultery: 
that it is allowable, that it is becoming, that it is the delight of life, that the procreation of offspring is thereby promoted, and so on; all these thoughts being falsities from evil. [2] But 
the falsity which produces evil takes place when from his religious belief a man conceives some principle, and consequently believes that it is good or holy, when yet in itself it is evil. For example, 
he who believes from his religion that there is some man who can save, and therefore worships and adores him, does evil from that falsity; and the same is true in regard to any other religious belief 
which in itself is false. As therefore falsity is from evil, and falsity produces evil, the expression "cry" is here used, signifying, as a kind of general expression, that which it involves, namely, 
evil; as is also evident from its being said, "whether they have made a consummation according to the cry of it which is come unto Me;" where "its cry" is put in the singular number, and "they have 
made a consummation," in the plural. [3] What a "consummation" is, was shown in volume 1 (n. 1857); and what a consummation is further, may be comprehended from the churches. The Most Ancient Church, 
which was called "Man," was the most celestial of all. This in process of time so far degenerated from the good of love, that at length nothing celestial remained, and then was its consummation, which 
is described by the state of those just before the flood.  [4] The Ancient Church (which was after the flood and was called "Noah," and was less celestial) also in course of time so departed from 
the good of charity, that nothing of charity remained, for it was turned partly into magic, partly into idolatry, and partly into a kind of dogmatic system separate from charity; and then was its consummation. [5] 
Another church succeeded, called the Hebrew Church, which was still less celestial and spiritual, placing somewhat of holy worship in external rites. This in course of time was distorted 
in various ways, and that external worship was turned into idolatry; and then was its consummation. [6] A fourth church was then restored among the posterity of Jacob, which had nothing celestial and 
spiritual, but only a representative of it; and therefore that church was a church representative of celestial and spiritual things, inasmuch as they did not know what their rites represented and signified; 
but it was instituted in order that there might still be some connection between man and heaven, such as there is between the representatives of good and truth, and good and truth themselves. 
This church at length so fell away into falsities and evils that every rite became idolatrous; and then was its consummation. Therefore, after the churches had thus successively declined-when in the 
last one the connection between the human race and heaven was altogether broken, insomuch that the human race would have perished because there was no church by which there could be a connection and 
a bond (see n. 468, 637, 931, 2054). [7] The Lord then came into the world, and by the unition of the Divine Essence with the Human Essence in Himself, conjoined heaven with earth, and at the same time 
He set up again a new church, called the Christian Church, which at first was in the good of faith, and its members lived in charity with one another as brethren. But in process of time this church 
has departed in diverse ways, and at the present day has become such that its members do not even know that the fundamental of faith is love to the Lord and charity toward the neighbor; and although 
they say from doctrine that the Lord is the Saviour of the human race, that they are to rise again after death, and that there is a heaven and a hell, yet few believe it. As this church has become such, 
its consummation is not far off. [8] All this shows what "consummation" is, namely, that it is when evil has come to its height. The case is similar in particular, that is, with every man; but how 
the case is with consummation as regards each person in particular, will of the Lord's Divine mercy be told in what follows. Consummation is treated of in the Word in various places, and the state which 
precedes is described by "vastation" and "desolation," which is followed by "visitation." </p>

<p align="center"><b>Elliott(1983-1999) 2243</b></p><p><b>2243.</b>
'Whether they have brought it to a close according to the cry of it which has come to Me; and if not, I will know' means whether evil has reached its peak. This is clear from the meaning of 'cry' as 
falsity, dealt with just above in <a href="2240.htm">2240</a>. There are two kinds of falsity, as was mentioned at the end of that paragraph, namely falsity which comes from evil, and falsity which produces evil. Falsity coming 
from evil consists in everything a person thinks while he is subject to evil, that is to say, everything which supports evil. For example, when a person is subject to adultery he thinks that adultery 
is permissible, that it is right and proper, that it is the delight of life, that the birth of offspring is promoted by it, and many other ideas such as these. These are all falsities coming from 
evil. </p>
<p></p>
<p><b>[2]</b>
 Falsity which produces evil however comes about when a person holds to some tenet of the religion he belongs to and as a consequence believes that it is good or holy, when in fact in itself 
it is evil. For example, a person who believes from his religion that some human being is able to save, and who therefore worships and venerates that human being, creates evil out of that falsity. 
The same applies to any other religious persuasion which in itself is false. Since falsity therefore both derives from evil and produces evil the word 'cry' occurs here and means, as a kind of general 
term, that which is implied by it, namely evil. This is also evident from the fact that the words 'whether they have brought it to a close according to the cry of it which has come to Me' include both 
'the cry of it' in the singular, and 'they have brought it to a close' in the plural. </p>
<p></p>
<p><b>[3]</b>
 What a close is has been shown in Volume One, in <a href="1857.htm">1857</a>. What more is implied by a close may be ascertained 
from the history of the Churches. The Most Ancient Church, which was called Man, was the most celestial of all, yet that Church in course of time so declined from the good that flows from love that 
at length nothing celestial was left. At this point it came to its close which is described by the state of those people prior to the Flood. </p>
<p></p>
<p><b>[4]</b>
 The Ancient Church, which came after the Flood, and 
was called Noah, and was less celestial, also in course of time so fell away from the good flowing from charity that no charity at all was left; for it was changed partly into magic, partly into idolatry, 
and partly into a system of doctrine separate from charity. At that point it reached its close. </p>
<p></p>
<p><b>[5]</b>
 Another Church then followed which was called the Hebrew Church and was less celestial and spiritual 
still, making a certain kind of holy worship consist in external religious observances. This Church as well was in course of time perverted in varying ways, and that sort of external worship 
was turned into idolatrous worship. At that point it reached its close. </p>
<p></p>
<p><b>[6]</b>
 A fourth Church was established after that among the descendants of Jacob, which did not possess anything celestial or spiritual, 
only that which was the representative of such. Consequently that Church was a Church representative of celestial and spiritual things, for what their religious observances actually represented 
and meant they did not know. But that Church was established in order that some link might nevertheless exist between man and heaven, like that which exists between the representatives of good and 
truth, and good and truth themselves. This Church so went off in the end into falsities and evils that every religious observance became idolatrous, at which point it reached its close. </p>
<p></p>
<p><b>[7]</b>
 Therefore 
once those consecutive Churches, each declining as indicated, had come and gone- and in the last of them the link between the human race and heaven had become severed so completely that the human race 
would have perished because no Church existed to provide such a link and a bond, see <a href="468.htm">468</a>, <a href="637.htm">637</a>, <a href="931.htm">931</a>, <a href="2054.htm">2054</a> - the Lord came into the world; and through the Divine Essence united to the Human Essence 
within Himself, He joined heaven and earth together. At the same time He established a new Church, called the Christian Church, in which, to begin with, good that is the fruit of faith was present, and 
people lived together in charity as brethren. But with the passage of time it departed in different directions, and today has become such that people do not even know that faith is grounded in love 
to the Lord and charity towards the neighbour. And although they assert from doctrine that the Lord is the Saviour of the human race, that they will rise again after death, and that there is a heaven 
and a hell, few nevertheless believe these things. Since this Church has become such, its close is not far away. </p>
<p></p>
<p><b>[8]</b>
 These considerations show what the close is, namely that it is the time when evil 
has reached its peak. The situation is similar in particular, that is, with each individual; but how the close or climax comes about in the case of the individual will in the Lord's Divine mercy be 
discussed later on. Various places in the Word refer to the close and describe the state which comes before it as vastation and desolation, which is followed by visitation. </p>

</p><b>2243.</b>
`Num secundum clamorem ejus, qui venit ad Me, fecerint consummationem; et si non, cognoscam': quod significet num malum ad summum pervenerit, constat ex significatione `clamoris' quod sit falsum, de 
qua mox supra n. 2240; sunt duo genera falsi, ut ibi ad finem dictum, nempe falsum quod {1} ex malo, et falsum quod producit malum; falsum quod est ex malo, est omne quod cogitat homo dum in malo est, 
nempe quod favet malo, ut pro exemplo cum in adulterio est, quod tunc cogitat de adulterio quod licitum, quod decorum, quod jucundum vitae, quod procreatio sobolis inde {2} promoveatur, et plura talia, 
illa sunt omnia falsa ex malo; [2] falsum autem quod producit malum, est cum (o)homo aliquod principium ex religioso suo capit, et inde credit quod sit bonum aut sanctum, cum tamen in se est malum 
{3}, ut pro exemplo, qui ex religioso suo credit quod aliquis homo possit salvare, et illum ideo colit et adorat, is ex falso illo facit malum; ita ex quovis alio religioso quod in se est falsum; quia 
falsum est ex malo, et falsum producit malum, ideo hic `clamor' dicitur, ac ut commune quoddam significat id quod involvit, nempe malum, (m)quod etiam patet ex eo quod dicatur `num secundum clamorem 
ejus, qui venit ad Me, fecerint consummationem,' ubi `qui clamor' in singulari dicitur, et `fecerint consummationem' in plurali.(n)  [3] Quid sit consummatio; in Parte Prima n. 1857 ostensum est; praeterea 
quid consummatio, comprehendi potest ab Ecclesiis; Antiquissima Ecclesia quae `homo' dicta, omnium caelestissima fuit; haec temporis tractu a bono amoris ita degeneravit ut tandem nihil caeleste 
remanserit, et tunc fuit ejus consummatio quae describitur per statum eorum ante diluvium. [4] Antiqua Ecclesia quae post diluvium, et `Noahus' vocata est, et fuit minus caelestis, illa quoque temporis 
tractu a bono charitatis ita defecit ut nihil charitatis remanserit, versa enim est partim in magiam, partim in idololatriam, partim in quoddam dogmaticum separatum a charitate, et tunc fuit ejus 
consummatio.  [5] Successit alia Ecclesia quae `Hebraea' vocata est, et adhuc minus caelestis et spiritualis fuit, in externis ritibus aliquem sanctum cultum ponens; haec temporis tractu {4} varie deformata 
fuit, et cultus ille externus versus est in idololatricum, et tunc fuit ejus consummatio.  [6] Quarta Ecclesia dein instaurata {5} fuit apud Jacobi posteros, quae nihil caeleste et spirituale habuit, 
sed modo repraesentativum ejus, quare illa Ecclesia erat Ecclesia repraesentativa caelestium et spiritualium, nam quid ritus repraesentabant et significabant, non sciebant; sed instituta fuit ut 
usque aliquis nexus esset inter hominem et caelum qualis est inter repraesentativa boni et veri, et inter ipsum bonum et verum; haec Ecclesia in falsa et mala ita demum abivit ut omnis ritus (t)factus 
si idololatricus', et tunc fuit ejus consummatio; [7] quare cum post Ecclesia: ita successive decrescentes, in ultima prorsus disruptus esset nexus inter humanum genus et caelum, usque adeo ut periisset 
humanum genus quia nulla Ecclesia per quam nexus et vinculum, videatur n. 468 637, 931, 2054; tunc venit Dominus in mundum, et per unitionem Essentiae Divinae cum Humana in Se conjunxit caelum cum 
terra et simul tunc novam Ecclesiam, quae dicta Ecclesia Christiana, instauravit, quae primitus in bono fidei fuit ac inter se ut fratres in charitate vixerunt, sed haec temporis successu diversimode 
abscessit, et hodie talis facta ut ne quidem sciant quod fundamentale fidei sit amor in Dominum et charitas erga proximum, et tametsi ex doctrina dicant Dominum esse Salvatorem generis humani, eos 
resurrecturos post mortem, caelum et infernum esse, usque tamen pauci credunt; quia talis facta est haec Ecclesia, non procul est ejus consummatio.  [8] Ex his constare potest quid consummatio, nempe 
quod sit cum malum ad summum pervenit: similiter se habet in particulari, nempe apud unumquemvis hominem; sed quomodo consummatio in particulari apud unumquemvis se {6} habeat, ex Divina Domini Misericordia, 
in sequentibus dicetur.  In Verbo passim agitur de consummatione, et describitur status qui praecedit, per vastationem et desolationem, quam sequitur visitatio. 	@1 i est.$ 	@2 ita.$ 	@3 i 
et profanum et ex illo falso facit malum.$ 	@4 etiam.$ 	@5 restaurata I.$ 	@6 A has se before consummatio and before habeat. I retains only the former, but se habeat seems preferable.$ </p>
