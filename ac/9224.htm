<h3 align="center" class="ired">属天的奥秘 第9224节</h3>
<h4 align="center"></h4><p><strong>9224.</strong>“你要将头生的儿子归给我”表通过它们所获得的信的一切事物，即它们也要归于主，不可归于自己。这从“头生的儿子”和“归给我”的含义清楚可知：“头生的儿子”是指教会所拥有的信的一切事物（参看<a href="2435.htm">2435</a>，<a href="6344.htm">6344</a>，<a href="7035.htm">7035</a>，<a href="7039.htm">7039</a>，<a href="7778.htm">7778</a>，<a href="8042.htm">8042</a>节）；“归给我”是指归于主，因为在圣言中，“耶和华”表示主。“头生的儿子”所表示的信的一切事物是指源于仁之良善的信念；因为信从该良善产生。无论从圣言，还是从教会的教义所获得的真理，它们绝无可能变成信之真理，除非有它们能被植入其中的良善存在。原因在于，首先接受真理的，是理解力，因为它看见真理，并将它们引入意愿；当这些真理在意愿中时，它们就在人里面，因为意愿才是这个人真正的自己。因此，人若以信就是在此人意愿这些真理并出于意愿实行它们之前，与他同在的信，就大错特错了。在此之前，信之真理本身并没有生命。属于意愿的一切都被称为“良善”，因为它们是被爱着的；当在意愿中时，真理就这样变成良善，或信就这样变成仁。自古以来有两个争论一直困扰着教会。第一个就是教会的长子是信还是仁；第二个就是与仁分离之信是否带来拯救。这两个争论之所以产生，是因为在一个人重生之前，他能感知要成为信之事物的真理，不能感知系仁之良善的良善。因为信之真理是通过外在途径进入的，也就是说通过听闻进入，并被存在记忆里，从那里出现在理解力中。但仁之良善是通过内在途径流入的，即出于天堂经由内在人，也就是从主经由天堂流入，故感知不到，直到被称为信之真理的真理开始为了良善的功用和生活的缘故而被爱；当它们属于意愿时，这一切就会发生。这就解释了为何信被视为教会的长子，又为何人们将长子的名分，即超过仁之良善的优先和优越权也归于信；而事实上，仁之良善才是优先和更高的，信之真理只是表面上如此（<a href="3325.htm">3325</a>，<a href="3494.htm">3494</a>，<a href="3539.htm">3539</a>，<a href="3548.htm">3548</a>，<a href="3556.htm">3556</a>，<a href="3563.htm">3563</a>，<a href="3570.htm">3570</a>，<a href="3576.htm">3576</a>，<a href="3603.htm">3603</a>，<a href="3701.htm">3701</a>，<a href="4925.htm">4925</a>，<a href="4926.htm">4926</a>，<a href="4928.htm">4928</a>，<a href="4930.htm">4930</a>，<a href="4977.htm">4977</a>，<a href="5351.htm">5351</a>，<a href="6256.htm">6256</a>，<a href="6269.htm">6269</a>，<a href="6272.htm">6272</a>，<a href="6273.htm">6273</a>节）。<br />属教会的人之所以在这些问题上陷入模糊和黑暗，是因为他们没有意识到，宇宙万物皆与真理和良善有关，并且无论要成为什么事物，都必须与这二者有关。他们也没有意识到，人里面有两种官能，被称为理解力和意愿，真理与理解力有关，良善与意愿有关；若与这二者无关，任何东西都不会变成人自己的。由于这些事物处在模糊和黑暗之中，而人的思维观念却建立在这类事物的基础之上，所以这个错误无法显明给属世人。然而，如果这一点说清楚了，教会成员就会从圣言如同在清晰的光中那样发现，关于仁之良善，主自己已经说了无数的话；这良善在教会中居于首位；信只存在于该良善里面，不在任何地方。仁之良善就是出于对良善的意愿而行良善。他们还会发现与仁分离之信所带来的错误，如：一个人能意愿邪恶并相信真理，因此，真理能与邪恶一致；信能使天堂的生命与一个拥有地狱生命在里面的人同在，所以这一种生命能转化为那一种生命；因此，那些在地狱里的人能被提到天堂，在天使当中过一种与他们以前的生活相反的生活。持有这些错误的人没有考虑到，有人若过一种与在世上早已获得的生活相反的生活，就会丧失生命。试图这样做的人就像那些垂死挣扎，在可怕的痛苦折磨中结束自己生命的人。像这些和其它许多错误就是由与仁分离之信的教义带来的。</p>

<p align="center"><b>Potts(1905-1910) 9224</b></p><p><b>9224.</b>
The firstborn of thy sons thou shalt give to Me. That this signifies that also all the things of faith which are procured through these are to be ascribed to the Lord, and not to self, is evident from 
the signification of "the firstborn of the sons," as being all things of the faith of the church (see n. 2435, 6344, 7035, 7039, 7778, 8042); and from the signification of "giving unto Me" as being 
to ascribe to the Lord, for by "Jehovah" in the Word is meant the Lord. All the things of faith, which are signified by "the firstborn of the sons," are those which are from the good of charity, for faith 
comes forth from this good, because whether truths are taken from the Word or from the doctrine of the church, they cannot possibly become truths of faith unless there is good in which they may be 
implanted. The reason is that it is the understanding which first receives truths, because it sees them and introduces them to the will; and when they are in the will, then they are in the man, for 
the will is the man himself. Wherefore he who supposes that faith is faith with man before he wills these truths, and from willing does them, is very much mistaken. Previous to this the very truths of 
faith have no life. Everything that belongs to the will is called "good," because it is loved. Thus truth becomes good, or faith becomes charity, in the will. [2] There are two controversies which have 
infested the church from the earliest times; the one is whether faith or charity is the firstborn of the church; the other, whether faith separate from charity is saving. These controversies have 
arisen because, before a man has been regenerated, he perceives the truths which must be of faith; but not the good which is of charity. For the truths of faith enter by an external way, namely, by the 
hearing, and are stored up in the memory, and from this appear in the understanding. But the good of charity flows in by an internal way, namely, through the internal man out of heaven, that is, through 
heaven from the Lord, and therefore does not become a matter of perception until the truths which are called the truths of faith begin to be loved for the sake of a good use, and for the sake of 
life; and this takes place when they become of the will. From this then it is that faith was said to be the firstborn of the church, and also had attributed to it the right of primogeniture, that is, 
the right of priority and superiority over the good of charity; when yet the good of charity is actually prior and superior, and the truth of faith only apparently so (n. 3325, 3494, 3539, 3548, 3556, 
3563, 3570, 3576, 3603, 3701, 4925, 4926, 4928, 4930, 4977, 5351, 6256, 6269, 6272, 6273).  [3] The reason why the man of the church has been in obscurity on these subjects, is that he did not perceive 
that all things in the universe bear relation to truth and to good, and that they must bear relation to both in order to be anything. Neither did he perceive that there are two faculties in man, called 
the understanding and the will, and that truth bears relation to the understanding, and good to the will; and that unless there is this relation to both, nothing is appropriated to the man. As these 
things have been in obscurity, and yet the ideas of man's thought are founded upon such things, the error could not be made plain to the natural man; although if it had once been made plain, the 
man of the church would have seen, as in clear light from the Word, that the Lord Himself has said countless things about the good of charity; and that this good is the chief thing of the church; and 
that faith is not anywhere except in this good. The good of charity is to do what is good from the will of what is good. He would also have seen the errors that have been brought in by the doctrine of 
faith separate from charity; as, that a man can will evil and believe truth, consequently that truth can agree with evil; also that faith can make the life of heaven with a man whose life is infernal, 
and consequently that the one life can be transferred into the other; thus that those who are in hell can be raised into heaven, and live among the angels a life contrary to their former life; not considering 
that to live a life contrary to that with which the man has imbued himself in the world, is to be deprived of life, and that those who attempt this are like men in the death agony, who end 
their life in dreadful suffering. Such errors, and very many others, are brought in by the doctrine of faith separate from charity. </p>

<p align="center"><b>Elliott(1983-1999) 9224</b></p><p><b>9224.</b>
'The firstborn of your sons you shall give to Me' means also all the matters of faith that [are acquired] through them - that they are to be ascribed to the Lord and not to self. This is clear from the 
meaning of 'the firstborn of sons' as all matters of faith the Church possesses, dealt with in <a href="2435.htm">2435</a>, <a href="6344.htm">6344</a>, <a href="7035.htm">7035</a>, <a href="7039.htm">7039</a>, <a href="7778.htm">7778</a>, <a href="8042.htm">8042</a>; and from the meaning of 'giving to Me' as ascribing to the Lord, 'Jehovah' 
being used in the Word to mean the Lord. All matters of faith, meant by 'the firstborn of sons', are beliefs which spring from the good of charity; for faith comes into being from this good. 
Whether truths are acquired from the Word or from the teachings of the Church, they cannot by any means become matters of faith without the presence of good in which they can be implanted. The reason 
for this is that the understanding part of the mind is that which receives truths first, for it sees them and introduces them into the will; and when those truths are in the will they are in the person, 
the will being the person's true self. Anyone therefore who supposes that faith is faith with a person before the person wills it, and does it because he wills it, is very much mistaken. Nor before 
this do the truths of faith themselves have life in them. All that which belongs to the will is called good, because it is loved; thus truth becomes good, or faith becomes charity, when it is in the 
will.  </p>

<p><b>[2]</b>
 There are two controversies which have bothered the Church since earliest times. The first is whether faith is the firstborn of the Church or whether charity is; and the second is whether 
faith separated from charity brings salvation. The reason why these two controversies arose was that before a person has been regenerated he discerns the truths that are to become matters of faith but 
not the good that is the good of charity. For the truths of faith enter by the external route, that is to say, through hearing; they deposit themselves in the memory, and from there they appear in 
the understanding. But the good of charity flows in by the internal route - through the internal man from heaven, that is, from the Lord by way of heaven. Therefore it does not come to be discerned until 
the truths called matters of faith start to be loved for the sake of performing good and useful service and leading a good life, which happens when they come to belong to the will. This now explains 
why faith was declared to be the firstborn of the Church, and also why people attributed to it the rights of the firstborn, that is, the rights of priority and superiority over the good of charity, 
when in actual fact the good of charity is prior and higher, and the truth of faith only apparently so, see <a href="3325.htm">3325</a>, <a href="3494.htm">3494</a>, <a href="3539.htm">3539</a>, <a href="3548.htm">3548</a>, <a href="3556.htm">3556</a>, <a href="3563.htm">3563</a>, <a href="3570.htm">3570</a>, <a href="3576.htm">3576</a>, <a href="3603.htm">3603</a>, <a href="3701.htm">3701</a>, <a href="4925.htm">4925</a>, <a href="4926.htm">4926</a>, <a href="4928.htm">4928</a>, <a href="4930.htm">4930</a>, <a href="4977.htm">4977</a>, <a href="5351.htm">5351</a>, <a href="6256.htm">6256</a>, <a href="6269.htm">6269</a>, <a href="6272.htm">6272</a>, <a href="6273.htm">6273</a>.  </p>

 The reason why those who belong to the Church have been in the dark in regard to these matters is that they have failed to perceive that all things in the universe 
have connection with truth and good, and to be anything must have connection with both. They have also failed to perceive that in the human being there are two mental powers, the understanding and the 
will, and that truth has connection with the understanding and good with the will, and that without the connection with both nothing is made a person's own. Because these considerations have lain in 
the dark, and yet the ideas composing a person's thought are based on such considerations, the error could not be made plain to the natural man. Yet if it had at some time been made plain, members of 
the Church would have seen from the Word as in broad daylight that the Lord Himself had countless things to say about the good of charity, that this good ranks first in the Church, and that faith does 
not exist anywhere else than within that good. The good of charity consists in doing good because one wills it. They would also have seen the errors that teachings upholding faith separated from charity 
bring in with them. One such error is the idea that a person is able to will evil and believe truth, consequently that truth is in agreement with evil. Another is the idea that faith can cause the 
life of heaven to exist with a person who has the life of hell in him, therefore that one life can be transformed into the other, so that those in hell can be raised to heaven and lead among angels 
a life contrary to their former life. People entertaining such errors do not take into consideration the fact that if anyone leads a life contrary to the life already acquired in the world he is deprived 
of his life. Anyone who tries to do so is like those who are in the throes of death and end their life in dreadful torment. Errors like these and very many others are what the teachings upholding 
faith separated from charity bring in with them.  </p>

`Primogenitum filiorum tuorum dabis Mihi':  quod significet quod etiam omnia fidei quae per illa, nempe addicanda sint Domino et non sibi, constat ex significatione `primogeniti filiorum quod sint omnia 
fidei Ecclesiae, de qua n. 2435, 6344, 7035, 7039, 7778, 8042, et ex significatione `dare Mihi' quod sit addicare Domino, nam per `Jehovam' in Verbo intelligitur Dominus.  Omnia fidei, quae per `primogenitum 
filiorum' significantur, sunt quae ex bono charitatis sunt, nam fides ex hoc bono existit; vera enim sive ex Verbo sive ex doctrina Ecclesiae sumantur, nullatenus possunt fieri fidei nisi 
bonum sit cui implantentur; causa est quia intellectuale est quod primum recipit vera quoniam videt illa ac introducit illa ad voluntatem, et cum in voluntate sunt, tunc in homine sunt, voluntas enim 
est ipse homo; quapropter qui putat quod fides sit fides apud hominem priusquam vult illa et ex velle facit illa, valde fallitur; ipsa vera fidei nec prius vitam habent; omne id quod voluntatis est vocatur 
bonum quia amatur; ita verum fit bonum, seu fides {1} charitas, in voluntate. 2 Binae lites sunt quae Ecclesiam {2}a primaevis temporibus infestaverant, una, {3}num fides sit primogenitum Ecclesiae 
vel num charitas, altera, num fides separata a charitate salvet; quod illae lites exstiterint, causa fuit quod vera quae fidei erunt appercipiantur ab homine, non autem bonum quod charitatis, antequam 
homo regeneratus est; vera fidei enim intrant per viam externam, nempe per auditum, et se reponunt in memoria et inde in intellectuali apparent; bonum charitatis autem influit per internam viam, 
nempe per internum hominem, e caelo, hoc est, per caelum a Domino, et ideo non ad apperceptionem venit priusquam vera quae fidei dicuntur incipiunt amari propter usum bonum et propter vitam, quod fit 
cum fiunt voluntatis; inde nunc est quod primogenitum Ecclesiae dixerint fidem esse, et quoque attribuerint ei jus primogeniturae, hoc est, jus prioritatis et superioritatis super bonum charitatis, 
cum tamen bonum charitatis actualiter prius et superius est, et verum {4} fidei modo apparenter, videatur n. 3325, 3494, 3539, 3548, 3556, 3563, 3570, 3576, 3603, 3701, 4925, 4926, 4928, 4930, 4977, 5351, 
6256, 6269, 6272, 6273. 3 Quod homo Ecclesiae in obscuro de his fuerit, est quia non perceperat quod omnia in universo se referant ad verum et ad bonum, et quod ad utrumque ut sit aliquid; {5}nec 
perceperat quod in homine binae facultates {6}sint, intellectus (x)et voluntas, et quod verum se referat ad intellectum, (c)et bonum ad voluntatem, et quod si non ad utrumque, non sit appropriatum homini; 
haec quia in obscuro {7}fuerunt, et tamen ideae cogitationis hominis super talibus fundantur, {8}ideo error coram naturali homine non manifestari potuit; cum tamen si semel manifestatus fuerit, 
(x)vidisset homo Ecclesiae ut in clara luce ex Verbo quod Ipse Dominus locutus est innumerabilia de bono charitatis, et quod id sit principale Ecclesiae, et quod fides non alibi quam in illo bono sit; 
bonum charitatis est facere bonum ex velle bonum.  Vidisset etiam errores quos inducit doctrina fidei separatae a charitate, sicut quod homo possit velle malum et credere verum, consequenter quod verum 
cum malo concordet; tum quoque quod fides possit facere vitam caeli apud hominem cui vita infernalis est, proinde quod una vita (t)possit transcribi in alteram, et sic quod qui in inferno sunt possint 
elevari in caelum et inter angelos vivere vitam priori vitae contrariam, non considerantes quod vivere vitam contrariam vitae quam (d)homo imbuerat in mundo, sit privari vita; et qui hoc tentant 
sint sicut qui in agone mortis sunt et per diros cruciatus finiunt suam vitam.  Tales errores et perplures alios inducit doctrina fidei separatae a charitate. @1 fit$ @2 ab antiquo tempore$ @3 quid
