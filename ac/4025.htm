<h3 align="center" class="ired">属天的奥秘 第4025节</h3>
<h4 align="center"></h4><p><strong>4025.</strong>“把自己的羊群单独放一处”表凭祂自己能力将良善与真理分离出来。这从“群”或“羊群”和“单独放”的含义清楚可知：“群”或“羊群”是指良善与真理；“单独放”是指把凭祂自己的能力所获得的事物分离出来。就至高意义而言，此处所论述的主题是主自己，即祂如何使自己的属世层变成神性，并且是凭祂自己的能力而如此行的，然而仍是通过次序所要求的这类方法而行。祂使之变成自己里面的神性的良善与真理在此由“他单独所放的群”来表示。</p>

<p align="center"><b>Potts(1905-1910) 4025</b></p><p><b>4025.</b>
And he put for himself droves for himself alone. That this signifies the separation of the goods and truths by His own power, is evident from the signification of "droves," or of the "flock," as being 
goods and truths; and from the signification of "putting for himself, for himself alone," as being to separate those things which have been procured by His own power. In the supreme sense here the subject 
treated of is the Lord, how He made His natural Divine, and this from His own power, but still by means according to order. The goods and truths that He made Divine in Himself are here the "droves, 
which he put for himself, for himself alone." </p>

<p align="center"><b>Elliott(1983-1999) 4025</b></p><p><b>4025.</b>
'And he put his own droves apart' means the separation of goods and truths by His own power. This is clear from the meaning of 'droves', or flock, as goods and truths; and from the meaning of 'putting 
his own apart' as separating the things which had been acquired by His own power. The highest sense here deals with how the Lord Himself made His Natural Divine, doing so by His own power, yet employing 
such means as order required. The goods and truths which He made Divine within Himself are meant here by the droves which, being His own, He put apart from others. </p>

<p align="center"><b>Latin(1748-1756) 4025</b>
</p><b>4025.</b>
`Et posuit sibi catervas soli sibi':  quod significet separationem bonorum et verorum ex propria potentia, constat significatione `catervarum' nempe gregis quod sint bona et vera; et e significatione 
`ponere sibi soli sibi' quod sit separare illa quae ex propria potentia comparata sunt: in sensu {1}supremo hic agitur de Domino quomodo Ipse Naturale Suum Divinum fecit, et hoc ex propria potentia, 
sed usque per media secundum ordinem; illa bona et vera quae Divina in Se fecit, sunt hic catervae, quae `Sibi soli Sibi.' @1 i enim$ </p>
