<h3 align="center" class="ired">属天的奥秘 第5396节</h3>
<h4 align="center"></h4><p><strong>5396.</strong>我另外讲述以下内容。有大量灵人围着我，听上去乱哄哄的。他们全都抱怨说，一切都要毁灭；这伙灵人当中根本没有一点团结性，这使得他们害怕毁灭。他们还以为自己面临彻底的毁灭，就像这种事发生时的情形。但我在他们中间却察觉到一种柔和的声音，如天使般甜蜜，里面没有任何无序的东西。天使唱诗班就在他们中间，而这伙缺乏次序的灵人却在外边。这天使般的声音溪流持续了很长一段时间；我被告知，它代表主如何从他们中间的平安核心调控混乱无序的外部元素；祂通过使每一个元素远离它特有的错误而将最边远的混乱元素带回次序。</p>

By way of Appendix I may relate what follows. There was a numerous crowd of spirits about me that was heard like something devoid of order flowing. They were complaining that everything was going to 
destruction; for in that crowd nothing appeared consociated, and this made them fear destruction. They also supposed that it would be total, as is the case when such things happen. But in the midst of 
them I perceived a soft sound, angelically sweet, having nothing in it that was out of order. Angelic choirs were there within, and the crowd of spirits devoid of order was without. This angelic strain 
continued a long time; and I was told that by it was represented how the Lord rules confused and disorderly things which are without from what is peaceful in the midst, by which the disorderly things 
in the circumference are brought back into order, each from the error of its own nature. 	 	Genesis 42 	1. And Jacob saw that there was produce in Egypt, and Jacob said to his sons, Why do ye look 
at one another? 	2. And he said, Behold I have heard that there is produce in Egypt; get you down thither, and buy for us from thence; and we shall live, and not die. 	3. And Joseph's ten brethren 
went down to buy corn from Egypt. 	4. And Benjamin, Joseph's brother, Jacob sent not with his brethren; for he said, Peradventure mischief may befall him. 	5. And the sons of Israel came to buy in 
the midst of those that came; for the famine was in the land of Canaan. 	6. And Joseph he was the governor over the land; he it was that sold to all the people of the land; and Joseph's brethren came, 
and bowed down themselves to him with their faces to the earth. 	7. And Joseph saw his brethren, and he knew them, but made himself strange unto them, and spoke hard things with them; and he said 
unto them, Whence came ye? And they said, From the land of Canaan to buy food. 	8. And Joseph knew his brethren; but they knew not him. 	9. And Joseph remembered the dreams that he dreamed of them, 
and said unto them, Ye are spies; to see the nakedness of the land ye are come. 	10. And they said unto him, Nay my lord, but to buy food are thy servants come. 	11. We are all one man's sons; we are 
upright; thy servants are no spies. 	12. And he said unto them, Nay, but to see the nakedness of the land ye are come. 	13. And they said, We thy servants are twelve brethren, the sons of one man 
in the land of Canaan; and behold the youngest is this day with our father, and one is not. 	14. And Joseph said unto them, This is it that I spoke unto you, saying, ye are spies. 	15. Hereby ye shall 
be proved; by the life of Pharaoh ye shall not go forth hence, except your youngest brother come hither. 	16. Send one of you, and let him get your brother, and ye shall be bound, and your words shall 
be proved, whether there be truth with you; or else by the life of Pharaoh surely ye are spies. 	17. And he shut them up in custody three days. 	18. And Joseph said unto them in the third day, 
This do, and live; I fear God. 	19. If ye be upright, let one of your brethren be bound in the house of your custody; and go ye, bring produce for the famine of your houses. 	20. And bring your youngest 
brother unto me; and your words shall be verified, and ye shall not die. And they did so. 	21. And they said a man to his brother, We are surely guilty concerning our brother, in that we saw the 
distress of his soul, when he besought us, and we would not hear; therefore is this distress come unto us. 	22. And Reuben answered them, saying, Spoke I not unto you, saying, Do not sin against the 
child; and ye would not hearken? Moreover, behold his blood is searched for. 	23. And they knew not that Joseph heard them; for there was an interpreter between them. 	24. And he turned about from 
upon them, and wept; and he returned to them, and spoke unto them, and took Simeon from them, and bound him before their eyes. 	25. And Joseph commanded, and they filled their vessels with corn, and 
to restore their silver everyone's into his sack, and to give them provision for the way; and he did thus to them.	 26. And they lifted their produce upon their asses, and went thence. 	27. And one 
opened his sack to give his ass provender in the inn, and he saw his silver; and behold it was in the mouth of his bag. 	28. And he said unto his brethren, My silver is restored, and lo it is even in 
my bag; and their heart went forth, and they trembled a man to his brother, saying, What is this that God hath done to us? 	29. And they came unto Jacob their father to the land of Canaan, and told 
him all that had befallen them, saying, 	30. The man, the lord of the land, spoke hard things with us, and took us for spies of the land. 	31. And we said unto him, We are upright; we are no spies. 	32. 
We are twelve brethren, sons of our father; one is not, and the youngest is this day with our father in the land of Canaan. 	33. And the man, the lord of the land, said unto us, Hereby shall I 
know that ye are upright; let one of your brethren remain with me, and take for the famine of your houses, and go. 	34. And bring your youngest brother unto me, then shall I know that ye are no spies, 
but that ye are upright; I will give you your brother, and ye shall go about trading in the land. 	35. And it came to pass as they emptied their sacks, and behold everyone's bundle of silver was in 
his sack; and they saw the bundles of their silver, they and their father, and they were afraid. 	36. And Jacob their father said unto them, Me have ye bereaved, Joseph is not, and Simeon is not, and 
ye will take Benjamin; all these things be come upon me. 	37. And Reuben spoke unto his father, saying, Slay my two sons if I bring him not to thee; give him upon my hand, and I will bring him unto 
thee again. 	38. And he said, My son shall not go down with you; for his brother is dead, and he only is left; and mischief will befall him in the way wherein ye shall go, and ye will make my gray hairs 
go down in sorrow to the grave. </p>
<p>5396a. The Contents. 	 In the latter part of the last chapter the subject treated of was the influx and conjunction of the celestial of the spiritual with the 
memory-knowledges in the natural; and now the subject treated of is the influx and conjunction of the celestial of the spiritual with the truths of faith therein which are of the church. </p>

By way of addition let the following be recounted. There was a large crowd of spirits around me, which sounded like a disorderly lot going by. They were all grumbling, declaring that everything was now 
being destroyed; for no unity at all was apparent among those who constituted that crowd of spirits, which made them fear destruction. They also imagined that they faced total destruction, such as 
takes place when the situation is as it was with them. But I detected in the midst of them a soft, sweet angelic sound, which was a wholly well-ordered one. Angelic choirs were present in the middle 
of them, while the actual crowd of spirits in all their disorder were on the outside. That angelic stream of sound lasted for a long time, and I was told that it served to represent the way in which the 
Lord regulates confused and disordered outward elements from a peaceful centre within them; He brings order into the disordered most outlying elements by withholding each one from the error peculiar 
to it. </p>

come to us. <LI value='22'> And Reuben answered them, saying, Did I not say to you, saying, Do not sin against the boy - and you did not listen? And also, his blood; behold, it is required. <LI value='23'> And they did not know 
that Joseph was hearing, because the interpreter was between them. <LI value='24'> And he turned away from them and wept; and he came back to them and spoke to them; and he took Simeon from them, and bound him 
before their eyes. <LI value='25'> And Joseph gave the command to fill<A name="fntext2"></a><A href="#fn2"><sup>b</sup></a> their vessels with grain, and to restore their silver, each man's in his sack, and to give them provision for the way; and thus he did for 
them. <LI value='26'> And they loaded their corn onto their asses, and went from there. <LI value='27'> And one opened his sack to give fodder to his ass, in a lodging-place, and he saw his silver, and behold, it was in the

saying, What is this that God has done to us? <LI value='29'> And they came to Jacob their father, to the land of Canaan; and they pointed out to him all that was happening to them, saying,  <LI value='30'> The man, the 
lord of the land, spoke hard words to us, and took us for men spying out the land. <LI value='31'> And we said to him, We are upright men; we are not spies. <LI value='32'> Twelve are we, brothers, the sons of our father; 
one is not, and the youngest is today with our father in the land of Canaan. <LI value='37'> And the man, the lord of the land, said to us, By this I shall know that you are upright men: Cause one brother among you 
to remain with me, and take [food for] the famine of your houses, and go. <LI value='34'> And bring your youngest brother to me, and I shall know that you are not spies, that you are upright men; I will give you 
your brother, and you will wander through the land, trading. <LI value='35'> And so it was, as they were emptying their sacks, that behold, each man's bundle of silver was in his sack; and they saw their bundles 
of silver, they and their father, and they were afraid. <LI value='36'> And Jacob their father said to them, You have bereaved me [of my children]; Joseph is not, and Simeon is not, and you take Benjamin. All 
these things will be upon me. <LI value='37'> And Reuben said to his father - he said, Make my two sons die if I do not bring him back to you; give him into my hand, and I will bring him back to you. <LI value='38'> And he said, 
My son shall not go down with you, for his brother is dead, and he, he alone, is left. And should harm happen to him on the road on which you go, you will cause my grey hair to go down in sorrow 
to the grave.

<p>1. Et vidit Jacob, quod esset annona in Aegypto, et dixit Jacob filiis suis, Quare aspicitis vos? 2. Et dixit, Ecce audivi quod sit 
annona in Aegypto; descendite illuc, et emite nobis inde, et vivamus, et non moriamur. 3. Et descenderunt fratres Josephi decem ad emendum frumentum ex Aegypto. 4. Et Benjaminem fratrem Josephi non 
misit Jacob cum fratribus  ejus, quia dixit, Forte obveniat illi damnum. 5. Et venerunt filii Israelis ad emendum in medio venientium, quia fuit fames in terra Canaan. 6. Et Joseph is dominator super 
terram, his vendens omni populo terrae: et venerunt fratres Josephi, et incurvaverunt se ei facies ad terram. 7. Et vidit Joseph fratres suos, et agnovit illos, et gessit se alienum ad illos, et 
locutus cum illis dura, et dixit ad illos, Unde venistis et dixerunt, E terra Canaan, ad emendum cibum. 8. Et agnovit Joseph fratres suos, et illi non agnoverunt eum. 9. Et recordatus Joseph somniorum 
quae somniavit illis, et dixit ad illos, Exploratores vos, ad videndum nuditatem terrae venistis.   10. Et dixerunt ad eum, Non domine mi, et servi tui veniunt ad emendum cibum. 11. Omnes nos filii 
viri unius nos, recti nos, non sunt servi tui exploratores. 12. Et dixit ad illos, Non, quod nuditatem terrae venistis ad  videndum. 13.  Et dixerunt, Duodecim servi tui fratres nos, filii viri unius 
 in terra Canaan, et ecce minimus cum patre nostro hodie, et unus non est. 14. Et dixit ad illos Joseph, Hoc quod locutus ad vos, dicendo, exploratores vos. 15.In hoc probabimini, vivat Pharaoh, 
si exibitis exhinc nisi in venire frater vester minimus huc. 16.  Mittite e vobis unum, et accipiat fratrem vestrum, et vos vinciemini, et probabuntur verba vestra, an veritas cum vobis, et si non, 
vivat Pharaoh, quod exploratores vos. 17. Et conclusit illos ad custodiam tribus diebus. 18. Et dixit ad illos Joseph in die tertio, Hoc facite, et vivetis, DEUM ego timeo. 19. Si recti vos, frater 
vester unus vinciatur in domo custodiae vestrae, et vos ite, adducite annonam famis domorum vestrarum. 20. Et fratrem vestrum minimum adducatis ad me, et verificabuntur verba vestra, et non moriamini; 
et fecerunt ita. 21. Et dixerunt vir ad fratrem suum, Profecto, rei sumus nos super fratrem nostrum, cujus vidimus angustiam animae in deprecando illo ad nos, et non audivimus, propterea venit ad 
nos angustia haec. 22. Et respondit Reuben illis, dicendo, Nonne dixi ad vos dicendo, ne peccetis in natum? et non auscultavistis; et etiam sanguis ejus ecce inquiritur. 23. Et illi non sciverunt, 
quod audiens Joseph, quia interpres inter illos. 24. Et conversus a super illis, et flevit, et rediit ad illos, et locutus ad illos, et accepit ex illis Shimeonem, et vincivit illum ad oculos illorum. 25. 
Et praecepit Joseph, et impleverunt vasa illorum frumento, et ad reducendum argentum illorum, cujuslibet in saccum illius, et ad dandum illis viaticum ad viam; et fecit illis ita. </p>
<p>26.  Et sustulerunt 
annonam suam super asinos suos, et iverunt   inde. 27. Et aperuit unus saccum suum, ad dandum pabulum asino suo in diversorio, et vidit argentum suum, et ecce illud in ore manticae illius. 28. 
 Et dixit ad fratres suos, Reductum argentum meum, et etiam ecce in mantica mea; et exivit cor illorum, et intremuerunt  vir ad fratrem suum, dicendo, Quid hoc fecit DEUS nobis? 29.  Et venerunt 
ad Jacobum patrem suum, terram Canaan, et indicabant ei omnia obvenientia illis, dicendo. 30.  Locutus vir dominus terrae cum nobis dura, et dedit nos sicut explorantes terram. 31.  Et diximus ad eum, 
Recti nos, non sumus exploratores. 32.  Duodecim nos fratres filii patris nostri, unus non est, et minimus hodie cum patre nostro in terra Canaan. 33.  Et dixit ad nos vir dominus terrae, In hoc 
sciam quod recti vos, fratrem vestrum unum manere facite mecum, et famem domorum vestrarum accipite, et ite. 34.  Et adducite fratrem vestrum minimum ad me, et sciam quod non exploratores vos, quod 
recti vos; fratrem vestrum dabo vobis, et terram negotiando pervagabimini. 35.  Et fuit, illi evacuantes saccos suos, et ecce cuivis colligatio argenti sui in sacco suo, et videbant colligationes argenti 
illorum, illi et pater illorum, et timuerunt. 36.  Et dixit ad illos Jacob pater illorum, Me orbavistis, Joseph non est; et Shimeon non est, et Benjaminem sumitis; super me erunt omnia haec. 37. 
 Et dixit Reuben ad patrem suum, dicendo, Duos filios meos mori facias, nisi adduxero illum ad te, da illum super manum meam, et ego reducam illum ad te. 38.  Et dixit, Non descendet filius meus vobiscum, 
quia frater illius mortuus, et ille solus is relictus, et obveniat illi damnum in via qua ibitis in illa, et descendere facietis canitiem meam in maerore sepulcrum. </p>
