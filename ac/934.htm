<h4 align="center"></h4><p><strong>934.</strong>“冷”表爱，即仁和信的缺乏，“热”或“火”表爱或仁和信的存在。这一点可从以下圣言经文清楚看出来：启示录中，在给老底嘉教会的信中说到：<br />我知道你的行为，你也不冷也不热；我巴不得你或冷或热。你既如温水，也不冷也不热，所以我必从我口中把你吐出去。（启示录<a href="http://39-27.cn/启3.15.htm">3:15</a>-<a href="http://39-27.cn/启3.16.htm">16</a>）<br />“冷”表没有仁爱，“热”表很多仁爱。以赛亚书：<br />耶和华对我这样说，我要安静，在我的居所观看；如同日光中的清热，又如收割时的炎热中露水的云雾。（以赛亚书<a href="http://39-27.cn/赛18.4.htm">18:4</a>）<br />此处的主题是即将建立的新教会。“日光中的清热”和“收割时的炎热”表爱和仁。<br />这是那有火在锡安、有炉在耶路撒冷的耶和华说的。（以赛亚书<a href="http://39-27.cn/赛31.9.htm">31:9</a>）<br />“火”表爱。论到以西结所看到的基路伯，经上说：<br />至于四活物的形像，就如烧着火炭的形状，又如火把的形状；火在四活物中间上去下来；这火有光辉，从火中发出闪电。（以西结书<a href="http://39-27.cn/结1.13.htm">1:13</a>）<br />在同一先知书中，论及主，经上又说：<br />在他们头以上的穹苍之上有宝座的形像，仿佛蓝宝石的形状；宝座的形像上方有仿佛人的样子的形像在上头；我从祂的腰及以上仿佛看见如烧着火炭的形状，其中周围有火的形状；我又从祂的腰及以下仿佛看见如火的形状，祂的光辉在它周围。（以西结书<a href="http://39-27.cn/结1.26.htm">1:26</a>-<a href="http://39-27.cn/结1.27.htm">27</a>；<a href="http://39-27.cn/结8.2.htm">8:2</a>）<br />此处“火”同样表爱。但以理书：<br />上头坐着亘古常在者；祂的宝座乃火焰，其轮乃烈火；从他面前有火，像河发出，侍奉他的有千千，在祂面前侍立的有万万。（但以理书<a href="http://39-27.cn/但7.9.htm">7:9</a>-<a href="http://39-27.cn/但7.10.htm">10</a>）<br />此处“火”表主的爱。撒迦利亚书：<br />耶和华说，我要作耶路撒冷四围的火城。（撒迦利亚书<a href="http://39-27.cn/亚2.5.htm">2:5</a>）<br />此处论及新耶路撒冷。诗篇：<br />耶和华以风为使者，以火焰为仆役。（诗篇<a href="http://39-27.cn/诗104.4.htm">104:4</a>）<br />“火焰”表属天-属灵之物。<br />由于“火”表爱，故火也成为主的一个代表。这一点从燔祭坛上的火明显看出来，这火永不熄灭（利未记<a href="http://39-27.cn/利6.12.htm">6:12</a>-<a href="http://39-27.cn/利6.13.htm">13</a>），代表了主的怜悯。鉴于此，亚伦在进入赎罪之地前，要用取自燔祭坛上的火焚香（利未记<a href="http://39-27.cn/利16.12.htm">16:12</a>-<a href="http://39-27.cn/利16.14.htm">14</a>）。出于同样的原因，为了表示敬拜被主悦纳，有火从天上降下来，烧尽了燔祭（如利未记<a href="http://39-27.cn/利9.24.htm">9:24</a>等）。在圣言中，“火”还表我欲及其欲望。天堂之爱无法与我欲相容，故亚伦的两个儿子就被火烧灭，因为他们用凡火焚香（利未记<a href="http://39-27.cn/利10.1.htm">10:1</a>-<a href="http://39-27.cn/利10.2.htm">2</a>）。“凡火”表一切我欲和物欲，以及它们的一切欲望。此外，天堂之爱在恶人看来，无异于熊熊燃烧的吞灭之火，因此在圣言中，吞灭之火被归于主。如，西奈上的火代表主的爱或怜悯，百姓感觉它就象烈火，于是他们求告摩西，不再叫他们听见耶和华神的声音，也不再看见那大火，免得他们死亡（申命记<a href="http://39-27.cn/申18.16.htm">18:16</a>）。主的爱或怜悯在那些被我欲和物欲所吞噬之人看来，就有这样的表象。</p>

<p><strong>[NCE]934.</strong> The symbolism of cold as no love (that is, no charity) or faith, and of heat or fire as love (or charity) and faith, is attested by the following passages in the Word. In John, when he addressed the church of Laodicea:<br />I know your deeds, that you are neither cold nor hot. If only you were cold or hot! But since you are lukewarm and neither cold nor hot, I am about to spit you out of my mouth. (<a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_934/bible_king-james-version_revelation_3_15-16" target=_top>Revelation 3:15-16</a>)<br />Being cold stands for having no charity, and being hot, for having a wealth of it. In Isaiah:<br />This is what Jehovah has said: "I will rest and watch in my established position, like a sheen of heat on the light, like a cloud of dew in the heat of harvest." (<a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_934/bible_king-james-version_isaiah_18_4" target=_top>Isaiah 18:4</a>)<br />This passage is about planting a new church. The heat on the light and the heat of harvest stand for love and charity. In the same author:<br />Jehovah's fire is on Zion and his furnace is in Jerusalem. (<a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_934/bible_king-james-version_isaiah_31_9" target=_top>Isaiah 31:9</a>)<br />Fire stands for love. In respect to the guardian beings that Ezekiel saw:<br />What the living creatures looked like: Their appearance was like burning embers of fire, like the appearance of lamps. The fire was moving along among the living creatures, and it had brilliance, and from the fire went out lightning. (<a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_934/bible_king-james-version_ezekiel_1_13" target=_top>Ezekiel 1:13</a>)<br />[2] And in the same author, describing the Lord:<br />Above the expanse that was over the head of the guardian beings was a seeming appearance of sapphire stone, like a throne. And on the likeness of a throne was what looked like the appearance of a person on it, high above. And I saw the seeming form of a fiery ember, like the form of fire, within him all around, from the appearance of his hips and up; and from the appearance of his hips and down I saw the seeming appearance of fire, which had a brilliance all around. (<a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_934/bible_king-james-version_ezekiel_1_26-27" target=_top>Ezekiel 1:26-27</a>; <a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_934/bible_king-james-version_ezekiel_8_2" target=_top>8:2</a>)<br />The fire stands for love. In Daniel:<br />The Ancient One sat; his throne was fiery flames, its wheels a burning fire. A river of fire was pouring forth and going out from before him. Thousands upon thousands were waiting on him, and myriads upon myriads were standing before him. (<a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_934/bible_king-james-version_daniel_7_9-10" target=_top>Daniel 7:9-10</a>)<br />The fire stands for the Lord's love. In Zechariah:<br />"I will be to them," says Jehovah, "a wall of fire all around." (<a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_934/bible_king-james-version_zechariah_2_5" target=_top>Zechariah 2:5</a>)<br />This is about a new Jerusalem. In David:<br />Jehovah makes the spirits{*1} his angels, the flaming fire his attendants. (<a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_934/bible_king-james-version_psalms_104_4" target=_top>Psalms 104:4</a>)<br />The flaming fire stands for something heavenly and at the same time spiritual.<br />[3] Since fire symbolized love, it also came to be used for representing the Lord, as is evident from the fire on the altar of burnt offering, which was never to be put out (<a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_934/bible_king-james-version_leviticus_6_9" target=_top>Leviticus 6:9</a>, <a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_934/bible_king-james-version_leviticus_6_12-13" target=_top>12-13</a>), representing the Lord's mercy. That is why Aaron had to burn incense with fire taken from the altar of burnt offering before he could go in to approach the appeasement cover (<a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_934/bible_king-james-version_leviticus_16_12-13" target=_top>Leviticus 16:12-13</a>, <a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_934/bible_king-james-version_leviticus_16_14" target=_top>14</a>). Furthermore, in order to symbolize the Lord's acceptance of the worship, fire was sent down from heaven and consumed the burnt offerings (<a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_934/bible_king-james-version_leviticus_9_24" target=_top>Leviticus 9:24</a>, for instance, and elsewhere).<br />In the Word, fire also symbolizes self-love and its craving, with which heavenly love cannot harmonize. That is why two of Aaron's sons were devoured by fire for using foreign fire in their sacrificial burning (<a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_934/bible_king-james-version_leviticus_10_1-2" target=_top>Leviticus 10:1-2</a>). Foreign fire is the totality of self-love and love of worldly gain, as well as all the cravings that accompany those loves.<br />Besides, ungodly individuals experience heavenly love in no other way than as a burning, consuming fire. For this reason, the Word describes the Lord as a consuming fire. The fire on Mount Sinai that represented the Lord's love or mercy, for instance, was perceived by the people as a devouring fire, which is why they told Moses not to make them listen to Jehovah God's voice or look at the huge fire or they would die (<a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_934/bible_king-james-version_deuteronomy_18_16" target=_top>Deuteronomy 18:16</a>). This is what the Lord's love or mercy looks like to people inflamed with self-love and materialism.<br /><br /><strong>Footnotes:</strong><br />{*1} The Latin word here translated "spirits" is spiritus, the word Swedenborg usually uses to refer to spirits living in the spiritual world.

That "cold" signifies no love, or no charity and faith, and that "heat" or "fire" signifies love, or charity and faith, is evident from the following passages in the Word. In John it is said to the church 
in Laodicea: </p>
<p>     I know thy works, that thou art neither cold nor hot; I would thou wert cold or hot; so because thou art lukewarm, and neither cold nor hot, I will spew thee out of My mouth (Rev. 
3:15-16); </p>
<p>where "cold" denotes no charity, and "hot" much charity. In Isaiah: </p>
<p>     Thus hath Jehovah said unto me, I will be still, and I will behold in My place; like the clear heat upon the light, 
like a cloud of dew in the heat of harvest (Isa. 18:4), where the subject is the new church to be planted; "heat upon the light" and "heat of harvest" denote love and charity. Again: </p>
<p>     Saith 
Jehovah, whose fire is in Zion, and His furnace in Jerusalem (Isa. 31:9), where "fire" denotes love. Of the cherubim seen by Ezekiel it is said: </p>
<p>     As for the likeness of the living creatures, their 
appearance was like burning coals of fire, like the appearance of torches; it went up and down among the living creatures; and the fire was bright, and out of the fire went forth lightning (Ezek. 
1:13). [2] And again it is said of the Lord, in the same chapter: </p>
<p>     And above the expanse that was over their heads was the likeness of a throne, as the appearance of a sapphire stone; and upon 
the likeness of a throne was a likeness as the appearance of a man above upon it; and I saw as the appearance of burning coal, as the appearance of fire within it round about, from the appearance of His 
loins and upward; and from the appearance of His loins and downward I saw as it were the appearance of fire, and there was brightness round about Him (Ezek. 1:26-27; 8:2). Here again "fire" denotes 
love. In Daniel: </p>
<p>     The Ancient of days did sit; His throne was flames of fire, and the wheels thereof burning fire; a fiery stream issued and came forth from before Him, a thousand thousands ministered 
unto Him, and ten thousand times ten thousand stood before Him (Dan. 7:9-10).Here "fire" denotes the Lord's love. In Zechariah: </p>
<p>     For I, saith Jehovah, will be unto her a wall of fire round 
about (Zech. 2:5), where the new Jerusalem is treated of. In David: </p>
<p>     Jehovah maketh His angels spirits, His ministers a flaming fire (Ps. 104:4), "a flaming fire" denoting the celestial spiritual. 
 [3] Because "fire" signified love, fire was also made a representative of the Lord, as is evident from the fire on the altar of burnt-offering which was never to be extinguished (Lev. 6:12-13), 
representing the mercy of the Lord. On this account, before Aaron went in to the mercy-seat, he was to burn incense with fire taken from the altar of burnt-offering (Lev. 16:12-14). And for the same 
reason, that it might be signified that worship was accepted by the Lord, fire was sent down from heaven and consumed the burnt-offering (as in Lev. 9:24, and elsewhere). By "fire" is also signified 
in the Word self-love and its cupidity, with which heavenly love cannot agree; and therefore the two sons of Aaron were consumed by fire, because they burned incense with strange fire (Lev. 10:1-2). "Strange 
fire" is all the love of self and of the world, and all the cupidity of these loves. Moreover, heavenly love appears to the wicked no otherwise than as a burning and consuming fire, and therefore 
in the Word a consuming fire is predicated of the Lord, as the fire on Mount Sinai, which represented the love, or mercy, of the Lord, and that was seen by the people as a consuming fire, and therefore 
they desired Moses not to let them hear the voice of Jehovah God, and see that great fire, lest they should die (Deut. 18:16). The love or mercy of the Lord has this appearance to those who are 
in the fire of the loves of self and of the world. </p>

<p align="center"><b>Elliott(1983-1999) 934</b></p><p><b>934.</b>
'Cold' means the absence of love, that is, of charity and faith, 'heat' or 'fire' the presence of love or of charity and faith. This becomes clear from the following places in the Word: In John, in the 
letter to the Church at Laodicea, </p>
<blockquote>
I know your works, that you are neither cold nor hot. Would that you were cold or hot! But because you are lukewarm, and neither cold nor hot I will spew you out 
of My mouth. <a href="http://bible.gospelcom.net/cgi-bin/bible?passage=Rev%207:15,%2016&amp;version=ESV&amp;interface=print&amp;showfn=yes&amp;showxref">Rev 7:15, 16</a>. 
</blockquote>
<p>Here 'cold' stands for no charity, 'hot' for much. In Isaiah, </p>
<blockquote>
Thus said Jehovah, I will be still and I will behold in My place; like clear heat on the light, like a 
cloud of dew in the heat of harvest. <a href="http://bible.gospelcom.net/cgi-bin/bible?passage=Isa%2018:4&amp;version=ESV&amp;interface=print&amp;showfn=yes&amp;showxref">Isa 18:4</a>. 
</blockquote>
<p>The subject here is a new Church that is to be founded. 'Heat on the light' and 'the heat of harvest' stand for love and charity. In the same prophet, 
 </p>
<blockquote>
Jehovah's fire is in Zion, and His furnace in Jerusalem. <a href="http://bible.gospelcom.net/cgi-bin/bible?passage=Isa%203:9&amp;version=ESV&amp;interface=print&amp;showfn=yes&amp;showxref">Isa 3:9</a>. 
</blockquote>
<p>'Fire' stands for love. Concerning the cherubim seen by Ezekiel, </p>
<blockquote>
As for the likeness of the living creatures, their appearance 
was like burning coals of fire, like the appearance of torches, moving between the living creatures. And the five was bright and out of the fire went forth lightning. <a href="http://bible.gospelcom.net/cgi-bin/bible?passage=Ezek%201:13&amp;version=ESV&amp;interface=print&amp;showfn=yes&amp;showxref">Ezek 1:13</a>. 
</blockquote>
<p></p>
<p><b>[2]</b>
 And concerning 
the Lord in the same prophet, </p>
<blockquote>
Above the firmament that was above the heads of the cherubim, in appearance like a sapphire stone, there was the likeness of a throne, and above the likeness of 
a throne, there was a likeness as the appearance of a man upon it above. And I saw as it were the shape of fiery coals, as the shape of fire, within it round about, from the appearance of His loins upwards. 
And from the appearance of His loins and downwards I saw as it were the appearance of fire, whose brightness was round about it. <a href="http://bible.gospelcom.net/cgi-bin/bible?passage=Ezek%201:26,%2027;%208:2&amp;version=ESV&amp;interface=print&amp;showfn=yes&amp;showxref">Ezek 1:26, 27; 8:2</a>. 
</blockquote>
<p>Here 'fire' stands for love. In Daniel, </p>
<blockquote>
The 
Ancient of Days was seated. His throne was flames of fire, its wheels were burning fire. A stream of fire issued and came forth from before Him, a thousand thousands served Him, and ten thousand 
times ten thousand stood before Him. <a href="http://bible.gospelcom.net/cgi-bin/bible?passage=Dan%207:9,%2010&amp;version=ESV&amp;interface=print&amp;showfn=yes&amp;showxref">Dan 7:9, 10</a>. 
</blockquote>
<p>'Fire' stands for the Lord's love. In Zechariah, </p>
<blockquote>
I will be to her, said Jehovah, a wall of fire round about. <a href="http://bible.gospelcom.net/cgi-bin/bible?passage=Zech%202:5&amp;version=ESV&amp;interface=print&amp;showfn=yes&amp;showxref">Zech 2:5</a>. 
</blockquote>
<p>This refers to the 
New Jerusalem. In David, </p>
<blockquote>
Jehovah makes winds His messengers, and flaming fire His ministers. <a href="http://bible.gospelcom.net/cgi-bin/bible?passage=Ps%20104:4&amp;version=ESV&amp;interface=print&amp;showfn=yes&amp;showxref">Ps 104:4</a>. 
</blockquote>
<p>'Flaming fire' stands for that which is celestial-spiritual. </p>
<p></p>
<p><b>[3]</b>
 Because 'fire' meant 
love, fire also became a representative of the Lord. This is clear from 'the five on the altar of burnt offering that was to be kept burning all the time', <a href="http://bible.gospelcom.net/cgi-bin/bible?passage=Lev%206:9,%2012,%2013&amp;version=ESV&amp;interface=print&amp;showfn=yes&amp;showxref">Lev 6:9, 12, 13</a>, representing the Lord's mercy. 
For this reason 'before Aaron entered the place of atonement he had to burn incense with fire taken from the altar of burnt offering', <a href="http://bible.gospelcom.net/cgi-bin/bible?passage=Lev%2016:12-14&amp;version=ESV&amp;interface=print&amp;showfn=yes&amp;showxref">Lev 16:12-14</a>. And also, to signify that worship was acceptable 
to the Lord, 'fire was sent down from heaven and consumed the burnt offering', as in <a href="http://bible.gospelcom.net/cgi-bin/bible?passage=Lev%209:24&amp;version=ESV&amp;interface=print&amp;showfn=yes&amp;showxref">Lev 9:24</a>, and elsewhere. In the Word 'fire' also means self-love and its attendant desire. With that love heavenly 
love can never agree; consequently it is also said that Aaron's two sons were devoured by fire because they employed strange fire, <a href="http://bible.gospelcom.net/cgi-bin/bible?passage=Lev%2010:1,%202&amp;version=ESV&amp;interface=print&amp;showfn=yes&amp;showxref">Lev 10:1, 2</a>. 'Strange fire' means all self-love and love of the 
world, and every desire accompanying those loves. In addition heavenly love seems to wicked people like nothing else than a burning and devouring fire; and this is why in the Word devouring fire is 
attributed to the Lord. The fire on Mount Sinai, for example, which represented the Lord's love or mercy, was perceived by the people as a consuming fire, as a consequence of which they told Moses not 
to make them hear the voice of Jehovah God, or see the great Fire lest they died, <a href="http://bible.gospelcom.net/cgi-bin/bible?passage=Deut%2018:16&amp;version=ESV&amp;interface=print&amp;showfn=yes&amp;showxref">Deut 18:16</a>. This is how the Lord's love or mercy appears to people engulfed in the fire of self-love and love of the world. </p>

ii 9, [A.V.5];                                                         ubi de nova Hierosolyma: apud Davidem,                             	Jehovah facit angelos suos spiritus, ministros suos ignem 
flammantem, Ps. civ 4;                                            'ignis flammans' pro caelesti spirituali.  [3] Quia 'ignis' significabat amorem, ignis quoque repraesentativum Domini factus, quod 
constat ex 'Igne super altari holocausti qui nusquam exstingueretur,' Lev. vi 2, 5, 6 [A.V. 9, 12, 13], repraesentans misericordiam Domini: ideo 'antequam Aharon intraret ad propitiatorium, suffire debebat 
igne sumpto ex altari holocausti,' Lev. xvi 12-14; ideo quoque, ut significaretur quod cultus esset acceptus Domino, 'ignis de caelo demittebatur et consumpsit holocausta,' ut Lev. ix 24, et alibi. 
Per 'ignem' quoque in Verbo significatur amor proprius et ejus cupiditas, cum quo amor caelestis concordare nequit, quare etiam 'bini filii Aharonis consumpti sunt igne, quod adolerent igne alieno,' 
Leo. x 1, 2; 'ignis alienus' est omnis amor sui et mundi et omnis amorum istorum cupiditas.  Praeterea etiam amor caelestis impiis non aliter apparet ac ignis ardens et consumens, ac ideo in Verbo 
praedicatur de Domino ignis consumens, sicut ignis super Monte Sinai, qui repraesentabat amorem seu misericordiam Domini, coram populo perceptus sicut ignis consumens;  	Quare dixerunt ad Mosen, ne 
faceret eos audire vocem 	Jehovae Dei, et videre Ignem magnum, ne morerentur, Deut. 	xviii 16. Amor seu misericordia Domini talis apparet iis qui in igne amorum sui et mundi sunt. 	@1 Heb. is [ ] (hashmal,) 
a word occurring only in Ezekiel. In his Sch. S notes non est pruna, sed intimum ignis, vide textum [ ] sic amor caelestis.$ </p>
