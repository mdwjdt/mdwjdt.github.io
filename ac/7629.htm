<h4 align="center"></h4><p><h4 align="center">内义</h4><br />7629.出埃及记10:1-6.耶和华对摩西说，你要到法老那里；我使他的心发沉，使他臣仆的心发沉，为要把我的神迹放在他中间。并要叫你在你儿子和你孙子的耳中讲述我在埃及所作的事，和我放在他们中间的神迹，好叫你们知道我是耶和华。摩西、亚伦就到法老那里，对他说，耶和华希伯来人的神这样说，你在我面前不肯自卑要到几时呢？容我的百姓去，好事奉我。你若不肯容我的百姓去，看哪，明天我要给你的境界带来蝗虫，遮满地面，人不能看到地，并且吞吃那逃脱的余剩物，就是冰雹所剩给你们的；要吞吃田间给你们生长的一切树木。你的房屋和你众臣仆的房屋，并一切埃及人的房屋，都要充满。你祖宗和你祖宗的祖宗自从在地上的那一天起，直到今日，没有见过这样的。摩西就转移目光，从法老面前出去。<br />“耶和华对摩西说”表一个命令。“你要到法老那里”表从神来的真理在侵扰者中间的出现。“我使他的心发沉，使他臣仆的心发沉”表他们仍旧固执，并且彼此都是一样的。“为要把我的神迹放在他中间”表好叫恶人知道他们陷入邪恶，叫善人对教会里那些过着邪恶生活之人的状态能有所启示。“并要叫你在你儿子和你孙子的耳中讲述我在埃及所作的事”表叫那些处于真理和良善的人能知道那些属于教会并侵扰正直人的人所遭遇的事。“和我放在他们中间的神迹”表叫他们对那些属于教会，却过着邪恶生活之人的状态能有所启示。“好叫你们知道我是耶和华”表由此让他们知道，主是独一神。“摩西、亚伦就到法老那里”表神之真理的出现。“对他说”表洞察。“耶和华希伯来人的神这样说”表来自主，就是教会之神的一个命令。“你在我面前不肯自卑要到几时呢”表不服从。“容我的百姓去，好事奉我”表他们要离开那些属于属灵教会的人，好叫他们敬拜主。“你若不肯容我的百姓去”表如果他们不离开他们。“看哪，明天我要给你的境界带来蝗虫”表虚假将占领他们最外面的部分。“遮满地面”表属世心智的最低层。“人不能看到地”表随之而来的整个属世心智的黑暗。“并且吞吃那逃脱的余剩物，就是冰雹所剩给你们的”表含有任何真理成分在里面的一切事物的消耗。“要吞吃田间给你们生长的一切树木”表因而他们从教会所获得的一切宗教知识的消耗。“你的房屋和你众臣仆的房屋，并一切埃及人的房屋，都要充满”表虚假将在属世心智的每一个部分，从其内层到最外层中掌权。“你祖宗和你祖宗的祖宗自从在地上的那一天起，直到今日，没有见过这样的”表自古时起，教会就没有像现在这样的虚假。“摩西就转移目光，从法老面前出去”表洞察力的缺乏，以及分离。</p>

THE INTERNAL SENSE.      Verses 1-6. And Jehovah said unto Moses, Come unto Pharaoh, because I have made heavy his heart, and the heart of his servants, that I may put these My signs in the midst of 
him; and that thou mayest tell in the ears of thy son, and of thy son's son, what things I have wrought in Egypt, and My signs which I have set in them, and that ye may know that I am Jehovah. And Moses 
and Aaron came unto Pharaoh, and said unto him, Thus saith Jehovah the God of the Hebrews, How long dost thou refuse to be humbled before Me? let My people go, that they may serve Me. For if thou 
refuse to let My people go, behold tomorrow I bring the locust into thy border; and it shall cover the surface of the land, that one shall not be able to see the land; and it shall devour the residue 
of that which is escaped that is left to you from the hail; and it shall devour every tree that sprouteth forth to you out of the field; and thy houses shall be filled, and the houses of all thy servants, 
and the houses of all the Egyptians, which thy fathers saw not, nor thy fathers' fathers, since the day that they were upon the ground even unto this day. And he looked back, and went out from before 
Pharaoh. "And Jehovah said unto Moses" signifies a command; "Come unto Pharaoh" signifies the presence of truth from the Divine with those who infest; "because I have made heavy his heart, and the 
heart of his servants," signifies that they all in general were determined; "that I may put these my signs in the midst of them," signifies that the evil may know that they are in evil, and that the 
good may be enlightened as to the state of those within the church who live evilly; "and that thou mayest tell in the ears of thy son, and of thy son's son, what things I have wrought in Egypt," signifies 
that they who are in truth and good may know what befalls those who are of the church and infest the upright; "and My signs which I have set in them," signifies that they may be enlightened with 
respect to the state of those who are of the church and live evilly; "and that ye may know that I am Jehovah," signifies that thus it may be known to them that the Lord is the only God; "and Moses and 
Aaron came unto Pharaoh," signifies the presence of truth Divine; "and said unto him," signifies discernment; "Thus saith Jehovah the God of the Hebrews," signifies a command from the Lord, who is the 
God of the church; "How long dost thou refuse to be humbled before Me?" signifies disobedience; "let My people go, that they may serve Me," signifies that they should leave those who are of the spiritual 
church, that they may worship the Lord; "for if thou refuse to let My people go," signifies if they would not leave them; "behold tomorrow I bring the locust into thy border," signifies that falsity 
will take possession of their extremes; "and it shall cover the surface of the land," signifies the ultimates of the natural mind thence derived; "that one shall not be able to see the land," signifies 
the consequent darkening of the whole natural mind; "and it shall devour the residue of that which is escaped that is left to you from the hail," signifies the consuming of all things that have 
anything from truths; "and it shall devour every tree that sprouteth forth to you out of the field," signifies thus the consuming of all the knowledges which they have from the church; "and thy houses 
shall be filled, and the houses of all thy servants, and the houses of all the Egyptians," signifies that falsity will reign in each and all things in the natural, from its interior to its outermost; 
"which thy fathers saw not, nor thy father's fathers, since the day that they were upon the ground even unto this day," signifies that from ancient time such falsity has not been in the church as there 
is there; "and he looked back, and went out from before Pharaoh," signifies privation of discernment, and separation.  </p>

THE INTERNAL SENSE </p>
<p>Verses 1-6 And Jehovah said to Moses, Go to Pharaoh; for I have made his heart stubborn, and the heart of his servants, in order that I may set these My signs in the midst of him; 
and in order that you may tell in the ears of your son and your son's son the deeds which I have performed in Egypt, and My signs which I have set among them, and that you may know that I am Jehovah. 
And Moses and Aaron went to Pharaoh, and said to him, Thus says Jehovah the God of the Hebrews, How long do you refuse to humble yourself<A name="fntext1"></a><A href="#fn1"><sup>a</sup></a> before Me? Send My people away, and let them serve Me. For 
if you refuse to send My people away, behold, tomorrow I am bringing locusts into your border. And they will cover the surface of the land, and one will not be able to see the land; and they will devour 
the residue of what escaped and was left to you from the hail, and will devour every tree growing up for you out of the field. And your houses will be filled, and the houses of all your servants, 
and the houses of all the Egyptians - which<A name="fntext2"></a><A href="#fn2"><sup>b</sup></a> your fathers and your fathers' fathers have not seen, from the day they have been on the ground even to this day. And he looked away and went out from Pharaoh. </p>
<p>'And 
Jehovah said to Moses' means a command. 'Go to Pharaoh' means the presence of the truth from God with the molesting ones. 'For I have made his heart stubborn, and the heart of his servants' 
means that they remained obstinate, all in common with one another. 'In order that I may set these My signs in the midst of him' means in order that the evil may recognize that they are ruled by evil, 
and the good may be enlightened regarding the state of those within the Church who lead an evil life. 'And in order that you may tell in the ears of your son and your son's son the deeds which I 
have performed in Egypt' means in order that those guided by truth and governed by good may know what happens to the ones belonging to the Church who molest the upright. 'And My signs which I have set 
among them' means in order that they may be enlightened regarding the state of those belonging to the Church who lead an evil life. 'And that you may know that I am Jehovah' means in order that it may 
thereby be made known to them that the Lord is the only God. 'And Moses and Aaron went to Pharaoh' means the presence of God's truth. 'And said to him' means discernment. 'Thus says Jehovah the God 
of the Hebrews' means a command from the Lord who is the God of the Church. 'How long do you refuse to humble yourself before Me?' means disobedience. 'Send My people away, and let them serve Me' means 
that they should leave those who belong to the spiritual Church, in order that these may worship the Lord. 'For if you refuse to send them away means should they fail to leave ... 'Behold, I am bringing 
locusts into your border' means that falsity will take possession of their outermost parts. 'And they will cover the surface of the land' means the lowest levels of the natural mind. 'And one will 
not be able to see the land' means a darkening of the whole natural mind as a result. 'And they will devour the residue of what escaped and was left to you from the hail' means the consumption of all 
things that have any element of truth in them. 'And will devour every tree growing up for you out of the field' means thus the consumption of all the religious knowledge that they get from the Church. 
'And your houses will be filled, and the houses of all your servants, and the houses of all the Egyptians' means that falsity will reign in every single thing in the natural from the inner part of 
it to the outermost. 'Which your fathers and your fathers' fathers have not seen, from the day they have been on the ground even to this day' means that since ancient times no such falsity had existed 
in the Church as existed there now. 'And he looked away and went out from Pharaoh' means deprivation of discernment, and separation.

SENSUS INTERNUS </p>
<p>Vers.  1-6.  Et dixit Jehovah ad Moschen, Veni ad Pharaonem; quia Ego aggravavi cor illius et cor servorum illius, propterea ut ponam signa Mea haec in medio illius.  Et propterea 
ut narres in auribus filii tui, et filii filii tui, quae operatus sum in Aegypto, et signa Mea quae posui in illis, et sciatis quod Ego Jehovah.  Et venit Moscheh et Aharon ad Pharaonem, et dixerunt 
ad illum, Ita dicit Jehovah Deus Hebraeorum, Quousque renuis humiliari coram Me? dimitte populum Meum, et serviant Mihi.  Quia si renuis tu dimittere populum Meum, ecce Ego adduco cras locustam in terminum 
tuum.  Et obteget superficiem terrae, et non poterit videre terram, et comedet residuum evasionis relictae vobis a grandine; et comedet omnem arborem germinantem vobis ex agro.  Et replebuntur domus 
tuae, et domus omnium servorum tuorum, et domus omnium Aegyptiorum; quam non viderunt patres tui, et patres patrum tuorum, a die fuerunt super humo usque ad diem hunc: et respexit et exivit a cum 
Pharaone.  `Et dixit Jehovah ad Moschen' significat mandatum: `Veni ad Pharaonem' significat praesentiam veri a Divino apud infestantes: `quia Ego aggravavi cor illius et cor servorum illius' significat 
quod obstinaverint se communiter omnes: `propterea ut ponam signa Mea haec in medio illius' significat ut cognoscant mali quod in malo sint, et boni illustrentur de statu illorum qui intra Ecclesiam 
male vivunt: `et propterea ut narres in auribus filii tui, et filii filii tui, quae operatus sum in Aegypto' significat ut sciant qui in vero et bono quid evenit illis qui ab Ecclesia sunt et infestant 
probos: `et signa Mea quae posui in illis' (x)significat ut illustrentur de statu illorum qui ab Ecclesia et male vivunt: `et sciatis quod Ego Jehovah' significat ut sic notum illis sit quod Dominus 
sit solus Deus: et venit Moscheh et Aharon ad Pharaonem' significat praesentiam veri Divini: `et dixerunt ad illum' significat apperceptionem: `Ita dicit Jehovah Deus Hebraeorum' significat mandatum 
a Domino Qui Deus Ecclesiae: `Quousque renuis humiliari coram Me?' significat non oboedientiam: `dimitte populum Meum {1}et serviant Mihi' significat ut relinquant illos qui ab Ecclesia spirituali, 
ut colant Dominum: `quia si renuis tu dimittere' significat si non relinquerent: `ecce Ego adduco locustam in terminum tuum' significat quod falsum occupabit extrema illorum: `et obteget superficiem 
terrae' significat ultima mentis naturalis {2}: et non poterit videre terram' significat obscurationem totius mentis naturalis inde: `et comedet residuum evasionis relictae vobis a grandine' significat 
consumptionem omnium quae aliquid a {3}vero habent: `et comedet omnem arborem germinantem vobis ex agro' significat sic consumptionem omnium cognitionum quae illis ab Ecclesia: `et replebuntur domus 
tuae, et domus omnium servorum tuorum, et domus omnium Aegyptiorum' significat quod regnabit falsum in omnibus et singulis in naturali ab interiore ejus ad extremum: `quam non viderunt patres tui, et 
patres patrum tuorum, a die fuerunt super humo usque ad diem hunc' significat quod tale falsum non fuerit ab antiquo tempore in Ecclesia, quale ibi: `et respexit et exivit a cum Pharaone' significat 
privationem apperceptionis et separationem. 	@1 ut I$ 	@2 i inde I$ 	@3 veris I$ </p>
