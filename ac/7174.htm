<h4 align="center"></h4><p><strong>7174.</strong>主显现之后，其中一些人被带到右前方；他们边走边说，他们看见一道光，远比以前所曾看见的更明亮、更纯净，并且人不可能再看见比这更大的光了；当时此处正是傍晚。说这话的人有很多。</p>

After the Lord had been seen, certain ones were brought toward the front to the right, and as they advanced they said that they saw a light much clearer and purer than they had ever seen before, and 
that no greater light was possible; and it was then eventide here. Those who said this were many. </p>

After the Lord had appeared some of them were taken to a position towards the front on the right, and as they went they said that the light was far clearer and purer than they had ever seen before, and 
that one could never see a greater light; and this was at evening time. Those who said this were many. </p>

</p><b>7174.</b>
Quidam postquam visus est Dominus, deducti sunt versus anteriora dextrorsum, et cum progrederentur, dicebant quod viderent lucem multo clariorem et puriorem quam usquam viderant, et quod major lux nusquam 
videri possit; et tunc erat hic tempus vesperae; qui id dicebant erant plures. </p>
