<h3 align="center" class="ired">属天的奥秘 第8787节</h3>
<h4 align="center"></h4><p><strong>8787.</strong>“你往百姓那里去”表结合。这从“摩西”和以色列人的代表清楚可知：“摩西”在此时是指天堂之下的从神来的真理（参看<a href="8760.htm">8760</a>节）；以色列人，即此处摩西要去往的“百姓”，是指那些属于属灵教会的人，如前面频繁所述。“往百姓那里去”当由耶和华来说时，之所以表示结合，是因为摩西所代表的从神来的真理是神性与那些属教会的人之间的中间人；因为要实现此处由耶和华和百姓之间的约所代表的结合，就必须有一个中间人。因此，“摩西”也代表在天堂之下与天堂中的神之真理相结合的从神来的真理（<a href="8760.htm">8760</a>节），如此结合是为了充当一个中间人。</p>

Go unto the people. That this signifies conjunction, is evident from the representation of Moses at this time, as being truth from the Divine which is beneath heaven (see above n. 8760); and from the 
representation of the sons of Israel, who are here "the people" to whom he was to go, as being those who are of the spiritual church (of which frequently above). That "to go unto the people," when said 
by Jehovah, denotes conjunction, is because truth from the Divine, which is represented by Moses, is that of the Divine which mediates with those who are of the church; for in order that conjunction 
may be effected, which is here represented by the covenant between Jehovah and the people, there must be mediation; therefore also by Moses is represented truth from the Divine beneath heaven conjoined 
with truth Divine in heaven (n. 8760), and this for the sake of mediation. </p>

'Go to the people' means a joining together. This is clear from the representation now of 'Moses' as the truth from God which was below heaven, dealt with above in <a href="8760.htm">8760</a>; and from the representation of 
the children of Israel, to whom 'the people' to whom he was to go refers here, as those belonging to the spiritual Church, dealt with often. The reason why 'go to the people', when said by Jehovah, 
means a joining together is that the truth from God, represented by 'Moses', is the intermediary between the Divine and those belonging to the Church; for in order that the joining together represented 
here by the covenant between Jehovah and the people may take place an intermediary must be present. Therefore also 'Moses' represents the truth from God below heaven joined to God's truth in heaven, <a href="8760.htm">8760</a>, so joined in order to serve as an intermediary. </p>

`Abi ad populum': quod significet conjunctionem, constat ex repraesentatione `Moschis' nunc, quod {1} sit verum a Divino quod infra caelum, de qua supra n. 8760, {2}et ex repraesentatione `filiorum 
Israelis,' qui hic `populus' ad quem abiret, quod sint qui ab Ecclesia spirituali, de qua saepius; quod `abire ad populum' cum dicitur a Jehovah, sit conjunctio, est quia verum a Divino, quod repraesentatur 
per `Moschen,' est medians Divini cum illis qui ab Ecclesia, nam ut conjunctio fiat, quae hic repraesentatur per `foedus inter Jehovam et populum,' erit mediatio; ideo quoque per `Moschen' repraesentatur 
verum a Divino infra caelum conjunctum cum vero Divino in caelo, n. 8760, hoc propter mediationem. 	@1 i hic$ 	@2 at I$ </p>
