<h3 align="center" class="ired">属天的奥秘 第6931节</h3>
<h4 align="center"></h4><p><strong>6931.</strong>从目前关于水星灵的阐述很清楚地看出，灵人会保留他们在来世的所见所闻，并且同样能接受教导，和在世为人时一样，因而能学习信的事物，以这种方式得以完善。灵人和天使越纯粹，就越容易并充分吸收他们所听到的东西，并且越发完美地将它们保留在记忆中。由于这一过程持续到永远，故显而易见，他们在智慧上不断成长。但水星灵在对事物的记忆知识上不断增长，然而却不由此在智慧上增长，因为他们热爱作为手段的知识，却不喜欢作为目的的功用，正如前面关于他们所记载的那样（<a href="6814.htm">6814</a>，<a href="6815.htm">6815</a>节）。</p>

From what has thus far been said about the spirits of the earth Mercury, it is very manifest that spirits retain what they see and hear in the other life, and can be instructed equally as when they were 
men, thus in the things that belong to faith, and in this way can be perfected. The purer spirits and angels are, the more readily and fully do they take in, and the more perfectly retain in the memory, 
what they hear. And as this goes on to eternity, it is evident that they are continually increasing in wisdom. But the spirits of Mercury are continually increasing in the memory-knowledge of things, 
yet not in wisdom from it, because they love knowledges, which are means, but not uses which are ends, as was related of them above (n. 6814, 6815). </p>

<p align="center"><b>Elliott(1983-1999) 6931</b></p><p><b>6931.</b>
From what has been stated so far regarding spirits belonging to the planet Mercury it is perfectly clear that spirits retain the things they see and hear in the next life and that they are able - no 
less than when they were men - to learn things and so to learn matters of faith and thereby be made more perfect. The purer spirits and angels are, the more immediately and completely they absorb the 
things they hear, and the more perfect is their retention of them in their memory. And since this goes on for evermore it is evident that they grow constantly in wisdom. But the spirits belonging to Mercury 
grow constantly in the knowledge of things, yet not from this in wisdom. This is because they love items of knowledge, which are the means, but not useful services, which are the ends, as what 
has been recorded about them in <a href="6814.htm">6814</a>, <a href="6815.htm">6815</a>, shows. </p>

Ex his quae hactenus de spiritibus telluris Mercurii dicta sunt, constat manifeste quod spiritus quae vident et audiunt in altera vita, retineant, et quod illi aeque ac cum fuerunt homines, instrui 
queant, {1}ita in illis quae fidei sunt, et sic perfici; quo (x)puriores spiritus ac angeli sunt, eo promptius et plenius hauriunt, et perfectius retinent memoria quae audiunt; et quia hoc in aeternum, 
{2} patet quod {3}crescant sapientia continue; Mercurii autem spiritus continue crescunt scientia rerum, sed inde non sapientia, quia cognitiones quae media sunt amant, non autem usus {4} qui fines; 
secundum ea quae de illis {5} n. 6814, 6815, memorata sunt. 	@1 imprimis$ 	@2 i inde$ 	@3 After continue$ 	@4 i inde$ 	@5 i prius$ </p>
