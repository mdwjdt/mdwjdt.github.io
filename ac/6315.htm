<h3 align="center" class="ired">属天的奥秘 第6315节</h3>
<h4 align="center"></h4><p><strong>6315.</strong>一个在尘世生活中通过信之良善从感官层面被提升上来的人，会交替处于感官层面的光和更内在层面的光。当他陷入世俗，与靠外在事物来滋养的人相伴，或他沉溺于纯粹的享乐之中时，便活在感官层面。在这种状态下，他会避开，而且反感谈论并思想神和属信仰的事。即便在那种状态下谈论并思想这些事，他也会认为它们一文不值，除非他当下被主提升至更内在的事物。当这个人没有被世俗事物占据，而是处于更内在层面的光时，他就会出于公义和公平进行思考；他若处于还要内在层面的光，就会出于属灵的真理与良善进行思考。过着良善生活的人会从一种光被提升至另一种光；一开始有邪恶的思维，他就立刻被提升至更内在的光；因为天使就在他身边。我已通过大量经历得以知道这一点，因为我经常意识到被提升，同时意识到我的情感和思维方面的状态变化。</p>

<p align="center"><b>Potts(1905-1910) 6315</b></p><p><b>6315.</b>
A man who in his earthly life has been elevated from sensuous things by means of the good of faith, is alternately in sensuous and in interior light; when he is in worldly cares, in company where external 
things flourish, and in pleasures, he is in sensuous life; in this state he shuns and is also averse to speaking and thinking about God, and about the things that belong to faith; and if he were 
then to speak and think on these subjects, he would make light of them, unless at the moment he were to be elevated by the Lord toward interior things. When the same man is not in worldly things, but 
in interior light, he thinks from what is just and fair; and if he is in a still more interior light, he thinks from spiritual truth and good. He who is in the good of life is elevated from one light 
into the other; and into the more interior light in an instant when he begins to think evilly; for angels are near him. This has been given to know by much experience, because I have frequently perceived 
the elevations, and at the same time the changes of state in respect to the affections, and in respect to the thoughts. </p>

<p align="center"><b>Elliott(1983-1999) 6315</b></p><p><b>6315.</b>
The person whose life has been raised up from the level of the senses by means of the good of faith is by turns in light on the sensory level and in light on a more internal one. When worldly cares occupy 
his attention, or he is among groups of people in which external interests flourish, or he indulges in mere pleasures, he is living on the sensory level. In this state he avoids and also objects 
to talking and thinking about God and matters of faith. If he did talk or think about them in that state he would consider them to be worthless unless he were instantly raised by the Lord from that level 
to more internal things. But when that person is not taken up with worldly things but sees in light on a more internal level, what is right and fair is the basis of his thought; and if he sees in 
light on a still more internal level, what is spiritually true and good is the basis of it. The person who leads a good life is raised from light on one level to that on another; he is raised to a more 
internal level the instant he begins to have evil thoughts, for angels are close by him. I have been allowed to know these things through experiences I have had, for I have frequently been aware of 
being raised up, and at the same time of changes of state in both my affections and my thoughts. </p>

</p><b>6315.</b>
Homo qui in vita sua elevatus est a sensualibus per bonum fidei, is alternatim est in lumine sensuali et in lumine interiore; cum in curis mundanis est, in consortiis ubi externa vigent, in voluptatibus, 
tunc in sensuali vita est; in (c)eo statu fugit et {1}quoque aversatur loqui et cogitare de Deo et de illis quae fidei sunt; et si de illis tunc loqueretur {2}et cogitaret, illa nihili faceret nisi 
momento elevaretur inde versus interiora a Domino; is homo cum non in mundanis est sed in interiore lumine cogitat ex justo et aequo; et si in lumine adhuc interiore, cogitat ex vero et bono spirituali. 
 Qui in bono vitae est, is ab uno lumine in alterum elevatur, et in lumen interius momento cum incipit male cogitare, nam angeli ei prope sunt.  Haec scire datum est per experientias, quia elevationes 
frequenter appercepi, et simul tunc mutationes status {3}quoad affectiones et quoad cogitationes. @1 quandoque$ @2 aut$ @3 cogitationis et affectionis$ </p>
