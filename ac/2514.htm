<h3 align="center" class="ired">属天的奥秘 第2514节</h3>
<h4 align="center"></h4><p><strong>2514.</strong>“夜间，在梦中”表模糊的直觉。这从“梦”和“夜间”的含义清楚可在。当论及直觉时，“梦”，尤其所提到的“夜间的梦”，表示相对于觉醒时的某种模糊之物。之所以说主最初的直觉是“模糊”的，是因为这直觉存在于祂要脱去的人身中，祂要驱散这人身的幽暗。尽管主的直觉来源于神性，却在这人身里面；而这人身的性质是，它不会马上接受光本身，而是随着那里的幽暗被驱散逐渐接受。6节经文提到神在梦中又来到亚比米勒那里，这表示祂将自己带入信之教义的某种不那么模糊的事物中，那里没有提到“夜”；而8节经文“亚比米勒清晨很早就起来”这句话则表示祂后来进入清晰的直觉中。</p>

In a dream by night. That this signifies that the perception was obscure, is evident from the signification of a "dream," and likewise of "night." A "dream," when perception is treated of, signifies 
something obscure in comparison with wakefulness; and still more when it is said "a dream by night." The Lord's first perception is called obscure, because it was in the human that He was to put off, 
and the shades of which He was to disperse. The Lord's perception, although from the Divine, was yet in the human, which is such that it does not immediately receive the light itself, but gradually as 
the shades which are there are dispersed. That He brought Himself into what was less obscure in regard to the doctrine of faith, is signified by "God coming again to Abimelech in a dream," as declared 
in verse 6, where there is no mention of "night;" and that He afterwards came into clear perception is signified in verse 8 by the words, "Abimelech rose early in the morning." </p>

'In a dream in the night' means a perception that was obscure. This becomes clear from the meaning of 'a dream' and at the same time of 'the night'. When perception is the subject, 'a dream' means something 
obscure in contrast to wakefulness, and still more when the expression 'a dream in the night' is used. The reason the Lord's initial perception is called obscure is that it existed within the 
human which He was to cast off and from which He was to dispel the shadows. Though it originated in the Divine the Lord's ability to perceive nevertheless existed within the human, the nature of which 
is such that it does not immediately receive light itself but gradually as the shadows there are dispelled. The bringing of Himself into something less obscure as regards the doctrine of faith is what 
is meant in verse 6 by a second reference - but without mention of 'the night'- to God's coming to Abimelech 'in the dream'. And His entry after this into clear perception is what is meant in verse 8 by 'in the morning Abimelech rose up early.' </p>

`In somnio noctu': quod significet obscuram, nempe perceptionem, constare potest a significatione `somnii,' et simul `noctis'; somnium cum agitur de perceptione, significat obscurum quid respective 
ad vigiliam, et magis cum dicitur `somnium noctu': quod obscura dicatur perceptio prima Domini, causa est quia in {1} humano quod exueret et cujus umbras discuteret; perceptivum Domini tametsi ex Divino, 
usque fuit in humano, quod tale est ut ipsam lucem non statim recipiat, sed successive sicut discutiuntur umbrae quae ibi; quod se redegerit in minus obscurum quoad doctrinam fidei, significatur per 
quod iterum `venerit Deus' ad Abimelechum in somnio, ubi non memoratur nox, vers. 6; et quod dein in claram perceptionem, significatur per quod `mane surrexit Abimelech in matutino,' vers. 8. 	@1 ex.$ </p>
