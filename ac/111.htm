<h3 align="center" class="ired">属天的奥秘 第111节</h3>
<h4 align="center"></h4><p><strong>111.</strong>要阐述其中的内义并不容易，因为今日之人对爱所生之信、智慧、智慧所生之聪明一无所知。外在之人只知记取知识，将之称为聪明智慧，并认为这就是信。他们甚至不知何为爱，不知何为意志，何为觉性，不知意志和觉性构成人的心智。其实，它们是各不相同的，整个天堂就是主照爱与信的无数细分而组织起来的。</p>

<p><strong>[NCE]111.</strong> Telling more about the inner meaning of these things, however, would be difficult, as people today know nothing about them. They have no concept, for instance, of a faith based on love, of wisdom, or of the intelligence that comes from these. Shallow people know hardly anything but secular facts, which they call understanding and wisdom, and also faith. They do not even know what love is, and many are unacquainted with the will and intellect and the fact that these two combine to form the mind. In reality, each of the above attributes has a distinct and in fact a unique identity; and the Lord attends to the finest possible distinctions in organizing all of heaven according to differences in love and faith, which are endless. </p>
<p align="center"><b>Potts(1905-1910) 111</b></p><p><b>111.</b>
It is however a very difficult matter to describe these things as they are in the internal sense, for at the present day no one knows what is meant by faith from love, and what by the wisdom and intelligence 
thence derived. For external men scarcely know of anything but memory-knowledge [scientia], which they call intelligence and wisdom, and faith. They do not even know what love is, and many do 
not know what the will and understanding are, and that they constitute one mind. And yet each of these things is distinct, yea, most distinct, and the universal heaven is ordinated by the Lord in the 
most distinct manner according to the differences of love and faith, which are innumerable. </p>

<p align="center"><b>Elliott(1983-1999) 111</b></p><p><b>111.</b>
It is extremely difficult however to present these matters as they stand in their interior sense because nowadays people do not know what faith deriving from love is, what wisdom is, and what intelligence 
from wisdom is. For external people are hardly aware of anything except knowledge which they call intelligence and wisdom, and even faith. They do not even know what love is. And many people do 
not know what will and understanding are, or that they comprise a single mind. Yet these are distinct and separate entities, totally distinct and separate. And the whole of heaven is ordered by the Lord 
quite distinctly and separately according to differences of love and faith, which are countless.

</p><b>111.</b>
Sed difficillime haec possunt dici quomodo se in sensu interiore habent, quia hodie ignota sunt, ut quid fides ex amore, quid sapientia et quid intelligentia inde; quia externi homines vix aliud norunt 
quam scientiam, quam et vocant intelligentiam et sapientiam, et fidem; ne quidem sciunt quid amor; et multi non quid voluntas intellectus, et quod unam mentem constituant; cum tamen singula distincta 
sunt, immo distinctissima, et universum caelum a Domino distinctissime ordinatum est secundum amoris et fidei differentias, quae innumerabiles.
