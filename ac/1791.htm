<h3 align="center" class="ired">属天的奥秘 第1791节</h3>
<h4 align="center"></h4><p><strong>1791.</strong>“亚伯兰说，主耶和华（Jehovih）啊”表主的直觉。这从以下事实清楚可知，即主具有至内在和最完美的直觉。如前所述，这种直觉是对天堂所发生一切事的一种知觉和意识。它还是唯独主所拥有的与耶和华的不断交流和内在交谈。这就是“亚伯兰对耶和华说”这句话的内义所表示的，因而是与耶和华对话时的亚伯兰所代表的。这在下文凡出现“亚伯兰对耶和华说”这句话的地方也同样适用。</p>

<p><strong>[NCE]1791.</strong> Abram said, "Lord Jehovih," symbolizes the Lord's perception, as can be seen from the fact that the Lord had the deepest, fullest perception of all. His perception, again, was a sensation and perceptive awareness of everything that was happening in heaven [<a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_1791/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_1786" target=_top>1786</a>]. It was also unbroken communication and internal conversation with Jehovah, which the Lord alone possessed. This communication is meant in an inner sense by "Abram said to Jehovah." In other words, it was represented by Abram when he talked with Jehovah. The meaning is the same wherever "Abram said to Jehovah" comes up below. </p>
<p align="center"><b>Potts(1905-1910) 1791</b></p><p><b>1791.</b>
Abram said, Lord Jehovih. That this signifies the Lord's perception, may be seen from the fact that the Lord had the most interior and perfect perception of all things. This perception, as before said, 
was a perceptive sensation and knowledge of all things that were taking place in heaven, and was a continual communication and internal conversation with Jehovah, which the Lord alone had. This is 
meant in the internal sense by the words "Abram said to Jehovah;" this was represented by Abram when he spoke with Jehovah; and the like is signified in what follows wherever the expression "Abram said 
to Jehovah" occurs. </p>

<p align="center"><b>Elliott(1983-1999) 1791</b></p><p><b>1791.</b>
'Abram said, O Lord Jehovih' means the Lord's perception. This becomes clear from the fact that the Lord had the inmost and most perfect perception of all. As stated already, this perception was a perceptive 
feeling and awareness of all that was happening in heaven; it was also a constant communication and internal conversing with Jehovah, which the Lord alone had. This perception is what is meant 
in the internal sense by the statement 'Abram said to Jehovah', and thus is what was represented by Abram when he addressed Jehovah. The same applies in what follows whenever the expression 'Abram said 
to Jehovah' occurs. </p>

<p align="center"><b>Latin(1748-1756) 1791</b>
</p><b>1791.</b>
'Dixit Abram, Domine Jehovih': quod significet Domini perceptionem, constare potest inde quod Dominus intimam et perfectissimam omnium perceptionem habuerit; perceptio erat, ut prius dictum, sensatio 
et cognitio perceptiva omnium quae fiebant in caelo: fuitque continua communicatio et interna collocutio cum Jehovah, quae sola Domino fuit; haec in sensu interno intelligitur per id quod 'dixerit Abram 
ad Jehovam,' ita repraesentata per Abramum quando locutus cum Jehovah; similiter in sequentibus, ubi occurrit quod Abram dixerit ad Jehovam. </p>
