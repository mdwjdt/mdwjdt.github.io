<h3 align="center" class="ired">属天的奥秘 第5422节</h3>
<h4 align="center"></h4><p><strong>5422.</strong>“却向他们装作生人”表因没有居间物而没有联结。这从“装作生人”的含义清楚可知，“装作生人”在此是指因没有一个居间物而没有联结。事实上，因没有居间物而与别人没有相互联结的人，似乎是一个陌生人；正如内在真理，或直接源于神性的真理在那些处于外在真理的人看来就像一个陌生人。这解释了为何约瑟在此向他的哥哥们装作生人。并不是说他真的与他们疏远了；确切地说，他爱他们，因为24节经文说到：约瑟转身离开他们，哭了一场。这种疏离感在他们那一方，因为他们没有与他联结；这由他如此表现自己来代表。例如，在圣言中，经上在有些地方会说，耶和华或主向百姓作外人，与他们作对，抛弃他们，诅咒他们，把他们送入地狱，惩罚，并且乐于做这些事。当这些事论及祂时，内义上的意思是，这些百姓向耶和华或主作外人，与祂作对，陷入将他们从祂面前赶走，诅咒他们，送他们下地狱，惩罚他们的邪恶；耶和华或主绝不是这类行为所来自的源头。圣言如此说是由于表象，因为在简单人看来，似乎是祂做了这些事。<br />内在真理的情形也一样。从没有通过居间物与内在真理联结的外在真理的角度来看，这些内在真理对它们来说似乎完全是陌生的，有时甚至与他们作对。而事实上，内在真理这一方并没有作对，作对的是外在真理那一方。因为当这些没有一个居间物将它们与内在真理联结起来时，它们必然通过与天堂之光分离的尘世之光来看待内在真理，因而看它们如同与其疏远的生人。关于这个问题，我们将在下文予以详述。</p>

But made himself strange unto them. That this signifies non-conjunction because without an intermediate, is evident from the signification of "making himself strange," as here being non-conjunction because 
without an intermediate; for one who is not in reciprocal conjunction, because without an intermediate, appears strange, just as internal truth, or truth immediately from the Divine, appears strange 
to those who are in external truths. For this reason it is that Joseph made himself strange to his brethren, not because he was estranged, for he loved them, so that he turned from them and wept 
(verse 24); but the strangeness on their part, because of non-conjunction, is represented by his so bearing himself. As for example, where it is said in the Word that Jehovah or the Lord "makes Himself 
strange" to the people, "opposes" them, "rejects" them, "condemns," "casts into hell," "punishes," and "delights" in such things, in the internal sense is meant that the people make themselves strange 
to Jehovah or the Lord, oppose Him, are in evils which reject them from His face, and which condemn them, cast them into hell, and punish them, and that such things never proceed from Jehovah or the 
Lord. But it is so stated in the Word on account of the appearance; for so it appears to the simple. The case is similar with internal truths when they are viewed by external truths without conjunction 
by what is intermediate; for then these truths appear altogether strange to external truths, and even sometimes opposite; when in fact the opposition is not in the internal, but in the external truths; 
for these without conjunction by what is intermediate cannot view the former except from the light of the world separate from the light of heaven, and consequently as strange to them. But in regard 
to this matter more will be said in what follows. </p>

<p align="center"><b>Elliott(1983-1999) 5422</b></p><p><b>5422.</b>
'And he acted as a stranger to them' means that in the absence of the intermediary no joining together took place. This is clear from the meaning of 'acting as a stranger' here as the fact that no joining 
together takes place because the intermediary is absent. For one who is not joined reciprocally to others because no intermediary is present seems to be a stranger, which is how internal truth, 
or truth coming directly from the Divine, is seen by people who are interested solely in external truths. This now explains why Joseph at this point acted as a stranger to his brothers. Not that he was 
really alienated from them; rather, he loved them, for verse 24 says that he turned away from them and wept. The alienation existed on their side, for the reason that they were not joined to him; and 
this was represented by his acting in the way he did. Let an exemplification of this be seen in those places in the Word which say that Jehovah or the Lord acts as a stranger towards people, sets Himself 
against them, casts them away, condemns them, sends them to hell, punishes them, and is delighted when such things are done. When these things are said of Him the meaning in the internal sense is 
that those people act as strangers towards Jehovah or the Lord, set themselves against Him, are subject to evils which cast these people away from His presence, condemn them, send them to hell, and 
punish them, and that Jehovah or the Lord is by no means at all the source from which such deeds spring. But the Word speaks as though He is since that is the appearance; for to the simple He does appear 
to do those very things. </p>

 Something similar is the case with internal truths. Looked at from the point of view of external truths that are not joined to them through an intermediary, those internal 
truths appear totally alien to them; indeed they are sometimes seen to be set in opposition to them. But there is no opposition on the part of the internal truths; rather it exists with the external 
ones. For when these have no intermediary to join them to internal truths they inevitably view the internal ones by the light of the world separated from the light of heaven, and consequently see 
them as strangers alienated from them. But more will be said about this further on. </p>

`Et gessit se alienum ad illos':  quod significet non conjunctionem quia absque medio, constat a significatione `gerere se alienum' quod hic sit non conjunctio quia absque medio; qui enim (t)non in 
conjunctione reciproca est quia absque medio, is apparet alienus, prout {1}verum internum seu verum immediate a Divino, illis qui in veris externis sunt {2}; inde nunc est quod Josephus se alienum gesserit 
ad fratres suos, non quod is alienus fuerit, amavit enim illos, nam conversus ab illis flevit, vers. 24, sed alienum a parte illorum ob non conjunctionem, repraesentatur per quod {3}ipse se ita 
gesserit; {4} sicut pro exemplo: ubi dicitur in Verbo quod Jehovah seu Dominus alienum se gerat populo, opponat se illis, rejiciat illos, damnet, mittat in infernum, puniat, delectetur ut talia fiant, 
intelligitur in sensu interno quod illi se alienos Jehovae seu Domino gerant, opponant se Ipsi, in malis sint quae rejiciunt illos a facie Ipsius, quae damnant illos, quae mittunt {5} in infernum, et 
quae puniunt, et quod ex Jehovah seu Domino nusquam talia procedant; sed ita dicitur in Verbo propter apparentiam, simplicibus enim sic apparet. [2]Similiter se habet cum veris internis, cum ea spectantur 
a veris externis absque      conjunctione per medium, tunc apparent illa vera ab his prorsus aliena, immo quandoque opposita, cum tamen oppositio non est in veris internis sed apud vera externa; 
haec enim absque conjunctione per medium non spectare possunt illa aliter quam a luce mundi separata a luce caeli, consequenter aliena a se; sed de hac re plura in sequentibus. @1 A alters these to 
plurals$  @2 i non conjunctio per medium intercedat$  @3 ita se gesserit$  @4 i at in sensu interno intelligitur alienum apud illos qui spectant a nulla conjunctione$  @5 i illos$ </p>
