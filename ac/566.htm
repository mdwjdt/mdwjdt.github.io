<h3 align="center" class="ired">属天的奥秘 第566节</h3>
<h4 align="center"></h4><p><strong>566.</strong>“土地”表教会所在的整个区域。这一点从“土地”的意思清楚可知，在圣言中，对土地（ground）、陆地（land）、大地或地（earth）作了精确区分。用到“土地”时，就表示教会或教会的某个方面。这也是表示地的人或亚当之名的由来。但是，当圣言中出现“陆地”或“地”时，通常指没有教会或教会某个方面的地方，如第一章唯独用了“陆地” （land）一词，因为教会或重生者尚未出现。直到第二章才用了“土地”这个词，因为这时教会已经形成。本节以及7章4，23节也是如此，此处经文说要除灭土地上各种活物，表示在教会所在的区域；但在创世记（<a href="http://39-27.cn/创7.3.htm">7:3</a>）论到即将被创造的教会，经上说“可以留种活在全地上”。其它地方的经文也是这样，如以赛亚书：<br />耶和华要怜恤雅各，必再拣选以色列，将他们安置在本地。外邦人必将他们带回本土．以色列家必在耶和华的地上得外邦人为仆婢。（以赛亚书<a href="http://39-27.cn/赛14.1.htm">14:1</a>-<a href="http://39-27.cn/赛14.2.htm">2</a>）<br />此处论及被造的教会；而同样是这一章，没有教会的地方，经上则称之为“地”（ earth）（以赛亚书<a href="http://39-27.cn/赛14.9.htm">14:9</a>，<a href="http://39-27.cn/赛14.12.htm">12</a>，<a href="http://39-27.cn/赛14.16.htm">16</a>，<a href="http://39-27.cn/赛14.20.htm">20</a>，<a href="http://39-27.cn/赛14.21.htm">21</a>，<a href="http://39-27.cn/赛14.25.htm">25</a>，<a href="http://39-27.cn/赛14.26.htm">26</a>）。<br />②<br />犹大土地必使埃及惊恐；当那日埃及陆地必有五城的人说迦南的方言。（以赛亚书<a href="http://39-27.cn/赛19.17.htm">19:17</a>-<a href="http://39-27.cn/赛19.18.htm">18</a>）<br />这里的“土地”（ ground）表教会，“陆地”（ land）表没有教会。以赛亚书：<br />地要东倒西歪、好像醉酒的人。耶和华在高处必惩罚高处的军队，在土地上必惩罚土地上的列王。（以赛亚书<a href="http://39-27.cn/赛24.20.htm">24:20</a>-<a href="http://39-27.cn/赛24.21.htm">21</a>）<br />耶利米书：<br />耕地的也蒙羞抱头，因为土地都干裂，无雨降在地上。田野的母鹿生下小鹿。（耶利米书<a href="http://39-27.cn/耶14.4.htm">14:4</a>-<a href="http://39-27.cn/耶14.5.htm">5</a>）<br />此处“地”包含“土地”的意思，“土地”包含“田野”的意思。<br />③耶利米书：<br />祂将以色列家的后代从北方陆地，和赶他们到的各陆地领出。他们必住在自己的土地上。（耶利米书<a href="http://39-27.cn/耶23.8.htm">23:8</a>）<br />此处“陆地”和“各陆地”表没有教会的地方，“土地”表有教会或真正敬拜的地方。耶利米书：<br />我必将剩在这陆地、并住在埃及陆地的耶路撒冷的余民都交出来，我必将他们交出来，成为陆地列国邪恶的恐惧。我必使刀剑、饥荒、瘟疫、临到他们，直到他们从我所赐给他们和他们列祖的土地上灭绝。（耶利米书<a href="http://39-27.cn/耶24.8.htm">24:8</a>-<a href="http://39-27.cn/耶24.10.htm">10</a>）<br />“土地”表教义和由此产生的敬拜。本书（25:5）也有类似的意思。<br />④以西结书：<br />我从分散的各陆地聚集你们。我领你们进入以色列的土地，就是我起誓应许赐给你们列祖的陆地，那时你们就知道我是耶和华。（以西结书<a href="http://39-27.cn/结20.41.htm">20:41</a>-<a href="http://39-27.cn/结20.42.htm">42</a>）<br />“土地”表内在的敬拜。当内在的敬拜不存在时，经上就称为“陆地”。玛拉基书：<br />我必为你们斥责吞噬者，不容它毁坏你们的土产。你们田间的葡萄树也不掉果子。万国必称你们为有福的，因你们必成为喜乐的陆地！（玛拉基书<a href="http://39-27.cn/玛3.11.htm">3:11</a>-<a href="http://39-27.cn/玛3.12.htm">12</a>）<br />这里的“陆地”是指载体，因而明显指人，当“土地”表教会或教义时，人就被称为“陆地”。<br />⑤摩西五经：<br />你们外邦人，当与主的百姓一同欢呼，因他要洁净他的土地，他的百姓。（申命记<a href="http://39-27.cn/申32.43.htm">32:43</a>）<br />显而易见，这是指外邦人的教会，它被称为“土地”。以赛亚书：<br />因为在这孩子晓得弃恶择善之先，你所憎恶的那二王的土地必致见弃。（以赛亚书<a href="http://39-27.cn/赛7.16.htm">7:16</a>）<br />这指的是主的降临。“土地必致见弃”表教会或真正的信之教义。以这种方式明显用到“土地”和“田野” 这些词，是因为它们是被播种的地方。如以赛亚书：<br />你将种子撒在土地，主必降雨在其上。牛和驴驹在土地上耕种。（以赛亚书<a href="http://39-27.cn/赛30.23.htm">30:23</a>-<a href="http://39-27.cn/赛30.24.htm">24</a>）<br />约珥书：<br />田荒凉，土地悲哀，因为五谷毁坏。（约珥书<a href="http://39-27.cn/珥1.10.htm">1:10</a>）<br />从上述经文清楚可知，在希伯来语中被称为亚当的人由于土地一词而表示教会。</p>

<p><strong>[NCE]566.</strong> The symbolism of the face of the ground as that whole area where the church existed can be seen from the symbolism of the ground, since the Word carefully distinguishes ground from the earth or the land. Wherever it appears, ground symbolizes the church, or some aspect of the church. This is the origin of the human's name — Adam, which means ground.{*1} Often when the earth or the land is mentioned in the Word, it means the absence of the church or of anything having to do with the church. The first chapter is an example. In it, only the earth or land is mentioned,{*2} since the church — the regenerate person — did not yet exist. The ground is first mentioned in the second chapter, because by then the church did exist. Something similar occurs here and in the next chapter:<br />All substance would be destroyed from the face of the ground. (<a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_566/bible_king-james-version_genesis_7_4" target=_top>Genesis 7:4</a>, <a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_566/bible_king-james-version_genesis_7_23" target=_top>23</a>)<br />This means in the territory where the church was. In the same chapter:<br />... to keep their seed alive on the face of the earth. (<a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_566/bible_king-james-version_genesis_7_3" target=_top>Genesis 7:3</a>)<br />This is about a church yet to be created. The same holds true everywhere in the Word, as in Isaiah:<br />Jehovah will have mercy on Jacob and will yet choose Israel and will put them on their ground; and the peoples will take them and lead them to their place, and the house of Israel will inherit them upon the ground of Jehovah. (<a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_566/bible_king-james-version_isaiah_14_1-2" target=_top>Isaiah 14:1-2</a>)<br />This is about a church that has been formed; but a place where there was no church is called the earth in verses <a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_566/bible_king-james-version_isaiah_14_9" target=_top>9</a>, <a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_566/bible_king-james-version_isaiah_14_12" target=_top>12</a>, <a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_566/bible_king-james-version_isaiah_14_16" target=_top>16</a>, <a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_566/bible_king-james-version_isaiah_14_20-21" target=_top>20-21</a>, <a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_566/bible_king-james-version_isaiah_14_25" target=_top>25</a>, and <a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_566/bible_king-james-version_isaiah_14_26" target=_top>26</a> of the same chapter.<br />[2] In the same author:<br />And the ground of Judah will make Egypt quake. On that day there will be five cities in the land of Egypt speaking the tongue of Canaan. (<a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_566/bible_king-james-version_isaiah_19_17-18" target=_top>Isaiah 19:17-18</a>)<br />The ground is where the church is and the land is where the church is not. In the same author:<br />The earth will wander, wander, like a drunkard. Jehovah will punish the army of the heights on high, and the monarchs of the ground down on the ground. (<a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_566/bible_king-james-version_isaiah_24_20-21" target=_top>Isaiah 24:20-21</a>)<br />The meaning is similar. In Jeremiah:<br />Because of the chastened ground, since there was no rain on the land, the farmers were put to shame, they covered their head; for even the doe in the field gave birth. (<a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_566/bible_king-james-version_jeremiah_14_4-5" target=_top>Jeremiah 14:4-5</a>)<br />The land means the area surrounding the ground, and the ground means the area surrounding the field.<br />[3] In the same author:<br />He brought the seed of the house of Israel out from the north land and from all the lands to which I drove them, and they will live on their ground. (<a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_566/bible_king-james-version_jeremiah_23_8" target=_top>Jeremiah 23:8</a>)<br />The land and lands are where there are no churches; the ground is where the church or true worship is. In the same author:<br />I will make the survivors of Jerusalem — those left in this land and those living in the land of Egypt — I will make them a disturbance, an evil to all the kingdoms of the earth. And I will send against them sword, famine, and contagion to the point of devouring them off the ground that I gave to them and their ancestors. (<a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_566/bible_king-james-version_jeremiah_24_8-9" target=_top>Jeremiah 24:8-9</a>, <a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_566/bible_king-james-version_jeremiah_24_10" target=_top>10</a>)<br />The ground stands for theology and for the worship it gives rise to. The same holds true for <a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_566/bible_king-james-version_jeremiah_25_5" target=_top>Jeremiah 25:5</a>.{*3} [4] In Ezekiel:<br />I will gather you from the lands to which you have been scattered, and you will acknowledge that I am Jehovah, when I have returned you onto Israel's ground, onto the land in which I lifted my hand to give it to your ancestors. (<a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_566/bible_king-james-version_ezekiel_20_41-42" target=_top>Ezekiel 20:41-42</a>)<br />The ground stands for inner worship; it is called land when there is no inner worship. In Malachi:<br />I will harangue against the devouring pest for you, and it will not spoil the fruit of the ground for you; and the grapevine in the field will not be bereft for you. And all nations will call you fortunate, because you will be a land of pleasure. (<a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_566/bible_king-james-version_malachi_3_11-12" target=_top>Malachi 3:11-12</a>)<br />The land stands for the whole surrounding area and so, quite obviously, for a person, who is called "a land." The ground surrounded by that land stands for the church, or theology.<br />[5] In Moses:<br />Sing, you nations, his people. He will expiate the guilt incurred by his ground, his people. (<a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_566/bible_king-james-version_deuteronomy_32_43" target=_top>Deuteronomy 32:43</a>)<br />Clearly this stands for the church among non-Jewish nations, which is called the "ground."{*4} In Isaiah:<br />Before the child knew to spurn evil and choose good, the ground that you despise in the presence of its two monarchs would be deserted. (<a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_566/bible_king-james-version_isaiah_7_16" target=_top>Isaiah 7:16</a>)<br />This speaks of the Lord's Coming, saying that the ground prepared for the church — the true doctrine concerning faith — would be deserted. It is clear that the words ground and field are used in connection with planting, as in Isaiah:<br />He will give rain for the seed with which you would sow the ground. Oxen and young donkeys are working the ground. (<a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_566/bible_king-james-version_isaiah_30_23-24" target=_top>Isaiah 30:23-24</a>)<br />And in Joel:<br />The field was devastated and the ground mourned, because the grain was devastated. (<a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_566/bible_king-james-version_joel_1_10" target=_top>Joel 1:10</a>)<br />From this it can now be seen that the human — called adam in Hebrew, from the word for ground — symbolizes the church.<br /><br /><strong>Footnotes:</strong><br />{*1} On the apparent derivation of the name Adam from the Hebrew word for "ground," see note 2 in <a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_566/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_313" target=_top>313</a>.

[RS]<br />{*2} On the translation of the single Latin word terra with the two English words "earth" and "land," see note 1 in <a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_566/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_31" target=_top>31</a>. Contrary to the observation Swedenborg makes here, the Latin word rendered by the word "ground" (humus) does in fact appear once in the first chapter, near the end of verse <a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_566/bible_king-james-version_genesis_1_25" target=_top>25</a>, as does the Hebrew word underlying it (אֲדָמָה ['ăḏāmā]). (On this Hebrew word, see also note 2 in <a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_566/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_313" target=_top>313</a>.) Swedenborg elsewhere reiterates the importance of the distinction between "earth" or "land" and "ground" (see <a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_566/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_90" target=_top>90</a>, <a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_566/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_268" target=_top>268</a>, <a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_566/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_620" target=_top>620</a>, <a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_566/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_662" target=_top>662</a>, <a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_566/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_872" target=_top>872</a>, <a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_566/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_895" target=_top>895</a>), but assigns a wide and varied range of meanings to each term, depending on context. At times the meanings even overlap. For example, "earth" is here said to mean "the absence of the church or of anything having to do with the church" and "ground" is said to mean "the church." In <a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_566/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_662" target=_top>662</a> "earth" is said to mean "a person in the church" and "ground" is said to mean "the church itself." In <a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_566/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_872" target=_top>872</a> "earth" is said to refer to people before "the seed of faith's truth and goodness can be sown in them" and "ground" is said to mean "people in the church." Nevertheless in each context the distinction between the two terms is emphasized as important. [LHC, SS]<br />{*3} <a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_566/bible_king-james-version_jeremiah_25_5" target=_top>Jeremiah 25:5</a> reads, "Turn, please, each of you from your evil and from the wickedness of your deeds, and live on the ground that Jehovah gave you and your ancestors from age to age."

That by the "faces of the ground" is signified all that region where the church was, is evident from the signification of "ground;" for in the Word there is an accurate distinction made between "ground" 
and "earth;" by "ground" is everywhere signified the church, or something belonging to the church; and from this comes the name of "man" or "Adam" which is "ground;" by "earth" in various places is 
meant where there is no church, or anything belonging to the church, as in the first chapter, where "earth" only is named, because as yet there was no church, or regenerate man. The "ground" is first 
spoken of in the second chapter, because then there was a church. In like manner it is said here, and in the following chapter (Gen. 7:4, 23), that "every substance should be destroyed from off the 
faces of the ground" signifying in the region where the church was; but in Gen. 7:3, speaking of a church about to be created, it is said, "to keep seed alive on the faces of the ground." "Ground" has 
the same signification everywhere in the Word; as in Isaiah: </p>
<p>     Jehovah will have mercy on Jacob, and will yet choose Israel, and will set them upon their own ground, and the peoples shall take them, 
and shall bring them to their place, and the house of Israel shall inherit them on the ground of Jehovah (Isa. 14:1-2), speaking of the church that has been made; whereas where there is no church 
it is in the same chapter called "earth" (Isa. 14:9, 12, 16, 20-21, 25-26). [2] Again: </p>
<p>     And the ground of Judah shall be a terror unto Egypt; in that day there shall be five cities in the land 
of Egypt speaking with the lip of Canaan (Isa. 19:17-18), where "ground" signifies the church, and "land" where there is no church. In the same: </p>
<p>     The earth shall reel to and fro like a drunkard; 
Jehovah shall visit upon the army of the height in the height, and upon the kings of the ground on the ground (Isa. 24:20-21). In Jeremiah: </p>
<p>     Because of the ground that is worn, because there was 
no rain on the earth, the husbandmen were ashamed, they covered their heads, yea, the hind also calved in the field (Jer. 14:4-5), where "earth" is that which contains the "ground" and "ground" that 
which contains the "field."  [3] In the same: </p>
<p>     He brought the seed of the house of Israel from the northern land, from all the lands whither I have driven them, and they shall dwell on their own 
ground (Jer. 23:8), where "land" and "lands" are where there are no churches; "ground" where there is a church or true worship. Again:     I will give the remains of Jerusalem, them that are left 
in this land, and them that dwell in the land of Egypt, and I will deliver them to commotion, for evil to all the kings of the earth, and I will send the sword, the famine, and pestilence among them, 
till they be consumed from off the ground which I gave to them and to their fathers (Jer. 24:8-10), where "ground" signifies doctrine and the worship thence derived; and in like manner in the same Prophet, 
chapter 25:5. [4] In Ezekiel: </p>
<p>     I will gather you out of the lands wherein ye have been scattered, and ye shall know that I am Jehovah when I shall bring you again into the ground of Israel, 
into the land for which I lifted up My hand to give it to your fathers (Ezek. 20:41-42), where "ground" signifies internal worship; it is called "land" when there is no internal worship. In Malachi: </p>
<p> 
    I will rebuke him that consumeth for your sakes, and he shall not corrupt for you the fruit of the ground, nor shall the vine be bereaved for you in the field and all nations shall call you blessed, 
because ye shall be a delightsome land (Mal. 3:11-12), where "land" denotes the containant, and therefore it plainly denotes man, who is called "land" when "ground" denotes the church, or doctrine. [5] 
In Moses: </p>
<p>     Sing, O ye nations, His people, He will make expiation for His ground, His people (Deut. 32:43), evidently signifying the Church of the Gentiles, which is called "ground." 
In Isaiah: </p>
<p>     Before the child shall know to refuse the evil and choose the good, the ground shall be forsaken, which thou abhorrest in presence of both her kings  speaking of the advent of the Lord; 
that the "ground will be forsaken" denotes the church, or the true doctrine of faith. That "ground" and "field" are so called from being sown with seed, is evident; as in Isaiah: </p>
<p>     Then shall 
he give rain of thy seed wherewith thou shalt sow the ground; the oxen also and the young asses that labor on the ground (Isa. 30:23-24). And in Joel: </p>
<p>     The field is laid waste, and the ground hath 
mourned, because the corn is laid waste (Joel 1:10). Hence then it is evident that "man" who in the Hebrew tongue is called "Adam" from "ground" signifies the church. </p>

'The face<A name="fntext1"></a><A href="#fn1"><sup>a</sup></a> of the ground' means the whole of that area where the Church was. This is clear from the meaning of 'the ground', for in the Word a careful distinction is made between ground (humus) and land 
or earth (terra). Whenever 'ground' is used it means the Church or some aspect of the Church. This too is the derivation of the name Man or Adam, which means ground. But when 'land' or earth' occurs 
in the Word it frequently means where the Church or some aspect of the Church does not exist, as in Chapter <a href="1.htm">1</a> where the word 'land' alone is used, because the Church or regenerate person did not as 
yet exist. Not until Chapter <a href="2.htm">2</a> is the word 'ground' used because the Church has by now come into being. The same applies in the present verse and in verses 4, 23, of the next chapter, where it is said 
that every being was to be wiped off the face<A name="fntext1"></a><A href="#fn1"><sup>a</sup></a> of the ground, meaning within that area where the Church was; and in verse 7 of the next chapter, where the subject is the Church that is to be created, 
'to keep their seed alive on the face<A name="fntext1"></a><A href="#fn1"><sup>a</sup></a> of the ground'.<A name="fntext2"></a><A href="#fn2"><sup>b</sup></a> The same applies elsewhere in the Word, as in Isaiah,  </p>
<blockquote>
Jehovah will have compassion on Jacob, and will still choose Israel, and will set them 
on their own ground. And the peoples will take them and bring them to their place, and the house of Israel will inherit them on Jehovah's ground. <a href="http://bible.gospelcom.net/cgi-bin/bible?passage=Isa%2014:1,%202&amp;version=ESV&amp;interface=print&amp;showfn=yes&amp;showxref">Isa 14:1, 2</a>.   
</blockquote>
This refers to the Church once it 
has come into being; but when in the same chapter the Church does not exist it is called the land, verses 9, 12, 16, 20, 21, 25, 26.  </p>
<p></p>
<p><b>[2]</b>
 In the same prophet,  </p>
<blockquote>
And the ground of Judah will be 
a terror to Egypt. On that day there will be five cities in the land of Egypt which speak the language<A name="fntext3"></a><A href="#fn3"><sup>c</sup></a> of Canaan. <a href="http://bible.gospelcom.net/cgi-bin/bible?passage=Isa%2019:17,%2018&amp;version=ESV&amp;interface=print&amp;showfn=yes&amp;showxref">Isa 19:17, 18</a>.  
</blockquote>
<p>Here 'the ground' means where the Church exists, and 'the land' 
where it does not. In the same prophet,  </p>
<blockquote>
The land will surely stagger like a drunken man. Jehovah will visit the host of the height on high, and the kings of the ground on the ground. <a href="http://bible.gospelcom.net/cgi-bin/bible?passage=Isa%2024:20,%2021&amp;version=ESV&amp;interface=print&amp;showfn=yes&amp;showxref">Isa 24:20, 21</a>.  
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
Here the meaning is similar. In Jeremiah,   Because of the ground which was cracked since there was no rain on the land, the farmers were put to shame, and covered their heads. Even the hind 
in the field has calved. <a href="http://bible.gospelcom.net/cgi-bin/bible?passage=Jer%2014:4,%205&amp;version=ESV&amp;interface=print&amp;showfn=yes&amp;showxref">Jer 14:4, 5</a>.   
</blockquote>
Here 'the land' stands for that which includes the ground, and 'the ground' for that which includes the field.  </p>
<p></p>
<p><b>[3]</b>
 In the same prophet,    He led the seed 
of the house of Israel out of the north land and out of all the lands to where I have driven them. And they will dwell on their own ground. <a href="http://bible.gospelcom.net/cgi-bin/bible?passage=Jer%2023:8&amp;version=ESV&amp;interface=print&amp;showfn=yes&amp;showxref">Jer 23:8</a>.  </p>
<p>Here 'land' and 'lands' mean where Churches 
do not exist, 'the ground' where the Church or true worship does exist. In the same prophet,  </p>
<blockquote>
I will render the remnants of Jerusalem, those who are left in this land, and those who are dwelling 
in the land of Egypt, and I will render them as a horror for evil to all the kingdoms of the land. And I will send sword, famine, and pestilence upon them, until they are consumed from the ground which 
I gave to them and their fathers. <a href="http://bible.gospelcom.net/cgi-bin/bible?passage=Jer%2024:8-10&amp;version=ESV&amp;interface=print&amp;showfn=yes&amp;showxref">Jer 24:8-10</a>.  
</blockquote>
<p>'The ground' stands for doctrine and worship arising out of it. And something similar is found in 25:5 of the same book.  </p>
<p></p>
<p><b>[4]</b>
 In Ezekiel, </p>
<p> 
I will gather you out of the lands into which you have been scattered. And you will acknowledge that I am Jehovah when I bring you back to the ground of Israel, into the land which I lifted up My hand 
to give to your fathers. Ezek. 20:41, <a href="42.htm">42</a>.  </p>
<p>'The ground' stands for internal worship. It is called 'the land' when internal worship does not exist. In Malachi,  </p>
<p>I will rebuke the devourer for you, 
and he will not ruin for you the fruit of the ground, nor will the vine in the field fail you. And all the nations will call you blessed, for you will be a land of that which is pleasing. Mal. 3:11, 
<a href="12.htm">12</a>.  </p>
<p>Here 'land' stands for that which includes, and so plainly stands for man who is actually called 'the land', when 'ground' stands for the Church or doctrine.  </p>
<p></p>
<p><b>[5]</b>
 In Moses,  </p>
<p>Sing, O Nations, 
His people. He will reconcile His ground, His people. Deut. 32:43.    This clearly stands for the Church of the gentiles, which is called 'the ground'. In Isaiah,  </p>
<p>Before the boy knows to 
refuse evil and to choose good, the ground will be deserted which you loathe in the presence of its two kings. Isa. 7:16.  </p>
<p>This refers to the Coming of the Lord. 'The ground will be deserted' stands 
for the Church or true doctrine of faith. The words 'ground 'and 'field' are clearly used in this way because they are places that are sown, as in Isaiah,  </p>
<p>He will give rain for your seed with which 
you may sow the ground. Oxen and young asses tilling the ground . . . Isa. 30:23, <a href="24.htm">24</a>.  </p>
<p>And in Joel,  </p>
<p>The field has been laid waste, and the ground has been mourning because the corn has been 
laid waste. Joel 1:10.  </p>
<p>From these quotations it is now clear that 'man', who in Hebrew is called Adam from the word for ground, means the Church.

Quod per 'facies humi' significetur omnis ille tractus ubi Ecclesia fuit, constat a significatione 'humi,' nam in Verbo accurate distinguitur humus a terra; per 'humum' ubivis significatur Ecclesia 
seu aliquid Ecclesiae; inde quoque nomen hominis seu Adam, quod est humus; per 'terram' intelligitur ibi {1} passim non Ecclesia, seu non aliquid Ecclesiae, sicut in capite primo modo nominatur 'terra' 
quia nondum Ecclesia seu regeneratus homo; in capite secundo primum nominatur 'humus' quia tunc Ecclesia; similiter hic et in cap. seq. quod perderetur 'omnis substantia desuper faciebus humi,' vers. 
4, 23; ubi significatur in tractu ubi Ecclesia; et ibidem, 'Ad vivificandum semen super faciebus terrae {2} vers. 3, ubi de Ecclesia creanda: similiter in Verbo ubivis, ut apud Esaiam, 	Miserebitur 
Jehovah Jacobi, et eliget adhuc Israelem, et ponet illos super humo illorum,... et accipient eos populi, et deducent eos ad locum suum, et hereditabunt eos domus Israel super humo Jehovae, xiv 1, 2; </p>
<p>ubi

<p>similiter: apud Jeremiam,      	Propter humum contritam, quia non 
fuit pluvia in terra, pudefacti sunt agricolae, operuerunt caput suum; nam etiam cerva in agro peperit, xiv 4, 5; </p>
<p>ibi 'terra' pro continente ubi humus, et 'humus' pro continente ubi ager: [3] apud

<p>'terra et terrae' ubi non Ecclesiae, 'humus' ubi Ecclesia 
aut cultus verus: apud eundem, 	Dabo... reliquias Hierosolymae, relictos in terra hac, et habitantes in terra Aegypti, et dabo illos in commotionem, in malum omnibus regnis terrae,... et mittam in 
eos gladium, famem et pestem, usque ad consumere eos desuper 	humo, quam dedi illis et patribus eorum, xxiv 8-10; </p>
<p>'humus' pro doctrina, et cultu inde: similiter apud eundem, cap. xxv 5: [4] apud Ezechielem, 	Congregabo 
vos e terris, in quas dispersi fuistis, et agnoscetis, quod Ego Jehovah, cum reduxero vos in humum Israelis, in terram, qua sustuli manum Meam ad dandum eam patribus vestris, xx 41, 
42; </p>
<p>'humus' pro cultu interno, 'terra' vocata dum non cultus internus: apud Malachiam, 	Increpabo vobis in consumentem, et non corrumpet vobis fructum humi, neque orba erit vobis vitis in agro,... 
et beatos vos dicent omnes gentes, quia eritis vos terra 	beneplaciti, iii 11, 12; </p>
<p>ubi 'terra' pro continente, ita manifeste pro homine, qui vocatur 'terra'; ubi 'humus' pro Ecclesia aut doctrina:

malum, et eligere bonum, deseretur humus, quam tu fastidis coram duobus regibus ejus, vii 16; </p>
<p>de Adventu Domini; quod 'deseretur humus' pro Ecclesia seu doctrina vera fidei. Quod 'humus et ager' dicatur 
a semente, constat: ut apud Esaiam, 	Dabit pluviam seminis tui, quo semines humum;... boves et pulli asinini laborantes humum, xxx 23, 24: </p>
<p>et apud Joelem, 	Vastatus ager, et luxit humus, quia
