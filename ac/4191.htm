<h3 align="center" class="ired">属天的奥秘 第4191节</h3>
<h4 align="center"></h4><p><strong>4191.</strong>“雅各又对自己的弟兄说”表那些处于行为良善的人。这从“雅各”的代表和“弟兄”的含义清楚可知：“雅各”是指主的神性属世层，如前所述；“弟兄”是指良善（参看<a href="3815.htm">3815</a>，<a href="4121.htm">4121</a>节），在此是指那些处于行为良善的人，也就是外邦人，如前所示（<a href="4189.htm">4189</a>节）。因为所有处于良善的人都与主的神性结合，并因着这种结合而被主称为“弟兄”；如马可福音：<br />耶稣就四面观看那周围坐着的人，说，看哪！我的母亲，我的弟兄。凡遵行神旨意的人，就是我的弟兄姐妹和母亲了。（马可福音<a href="http://39-27.cn/可3.31.htm">3:31</a>，<a href="http://39-27.cn/可3.34.htm">34</a>-<a href="http://39-27.cn/可3.35.htm">35</a>）<br />一切结合皆通过爱与仁实现，这是谁都能明白的；因为属灵的结合无非是爱与仁。显然，对主之爱就是与祂结合；对邻之仁也是与祂结合，这一点从主在马太福音中的话明显看出来：<br />这些事你们既做在我这弟兄中一个最小的身上，就是做在我身上了。（马太福音<a href="http://39-27.cn/太25.40.htm">25:40</a>）<br />此处论述的主题是仁爱的行为。</p>

And Jacob said unto his brethren. That this signifies those who are in the good of works, is evident from the representation of Jacob, as being the Lord's Divine natural (concerning which above); and 
from the signification of "brethren," as being goods (see n. 3815, 4121); here, those who are in the goods of works, and who are Gentiles, as has been shown above (n. 4189). For all who are in good are 
conjoined with the Divine of the Lord, and on account of this conjunction are called by the Lord "brethren;" as in Mark: </p>
<p>     Jesus looking round on them which sat about Him, saith, Behold My mother, 
and My brethren; for whosoever shall do the will of God, the same is My brother, and sister, and mother (Mark 3:31, 34-35). All conjunction is through love and charity, as everyone can see; for spiritual 
conjunction is nothing else than love and charity. That love to the Lord is conjunction with Him is manifest; and that charity toward the neighbor is the same, is evident from the words of the 
Lord in Matthew: </p>
<p>     Inasmuch as ye did it unto one of the least of these My brethren, ye did it unto Me (Matt. 25:40); </p>
<p>the subject treated of here being the works of charity. </p>

<p align="center"><b>Elliott(1983-1999) 4191</b></p><p><b>4191.</b>
'And Jacob said to his brothers' means people who perform works that are inherently good. This is clear from the representation of 'Jacob' as the Lord's Divine Natural, dealt with already, and from the 
meaning of 'brothers' as goods, dealt with in <a href="3815.htm">3815</a>, <a href="4121.htm">4121</a>, in this case people performing works that are inherently good, who, as shown above in <a href="4189.htm">4189</a>, are the gentiles. For all who are governed by good 
are joined to the Lord's Divine, and because they are joined to Him they are called 'brothers' by the Lord, as in Mark, </p>
<blockquote>
Jesus looking around on those who were sitting around Him said, Behold My 
mother and My brothers! For whoever does the will of God is My brother, and My sister, and My mother. <a href="http://bible.gospelcom.net/cgi-bin/bible?passage=Mark%203:31,%2034,%2035&amp;version=ESV&amp;interface=print&amp;showfn=yes&amp;showxref">Mark 3:31, 34, 35</a>. 
</blockquote>
<p>Every joining together is effected through love and charity, as anyone may 
recognize, for a joining together spiritually is nothing other than love and charity. Love to the Lord, it is evident, causes one to be joined to Him; and so does charity towards the neighbour, as is 
clear from the Lord's words in Matthew, </p>
<blockquote>
Insofar as you did it to one of the least of these My brothers you did it to Me. <a href="http://bible.gospelcom.net/cgi-bin/bible?passage=Matt%2025:40&amp;version=ESV&amp;interface=print&amp;showfn=yes&amp;showxref">Matt 25:40</a>. 
</blockquote>
<p>This refers to charitable works. </p>

</p><b>4191.</b>
`Et dixit Jacob fratribus suis': quod significet illos qui in bono operum, constat ex repraesentatione `Jacobi' quod sit Divinum Naturale Domini, de qua prius; et ex significatione `fratrum' quod 
sint bona, de qua n. 3815, 4121, hic illi qui in bonis operum, qui quod gentes sint, supra n. 4189 ostensum; omnes enim qui in bono sunt, eum Divino Domini conjuncti sunt, et propter conjunctionem 
a Domino vocantur `fratres,' ut apud Marcum,           Jesus circumspiciens circumcirca, qui circum Ipsum      sedebant, dixit, Ecce mater Mea, et fratres Mei; quisquis      namque fecerit voluntatem 
Dei, hic frater Meus, et soror      Mea, et mater Mea, iii (x)31, 34, 35; </p>
<p>omnis conjunctio est per amorem et charitatem, quod unicuivis constare potest, nam conjunctio spiritualis non aliud est 
quam amor et charitas; quod amor in Dominum sit conjunctio cum Ipso, patet; </p>
<p>et quod charitas erga proximum pariter, constat a Domini verbis apud Matthaeum,           In quantum fecistis uni ex his 
fratribus Meis minimis,      Mihi fecistis, xxv 40; </p>
<p>hic de operibus charitatis agitur. </p>
