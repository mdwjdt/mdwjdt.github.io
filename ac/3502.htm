<h3 align="center" class="ired">属天的奥秘 第3502节</h3>
<h4 align="center"></h4><p><strong>3502.</strong>“照我所爱的给我作成美味”表从这真理所得来的愉悦形式，因为它是从良善所获得的。这从“美味”的含义清楚可知，“美味”是指愉悦的形式；因为它们出自以扫，而以扫代表属世层的良善，故它们表示从良善所获得的愉悦形式。在原文，“美味”表示令味觉快乐和愉悦的形式；在内义上则表示良善所具有的快乐和真理所具有的愉悦形式。原因在于，和其它身体感觉一样，味觉对应于属天和属灵之物。关于这种对应关系，蒙主的神圣怜悯，容后再述。若不了解属世层如何变成新的，或如何从理性层，即经由理性层从主那里接受生命，就不可能明白其中是何情形。<br />若不藉着教义事物，或对良善与真理的认知，属世层不会变成新的，或从理性层接受相对应的生命，也就是重生。属天之人主要藉着对良善的认知重生，而属灵之人则主要藉着对真理的认知重生。教义事物或对良善与真理的认知若不通过适合属世人的一切快乐和愉悦，就无法被传给属世人，因而无法与它联结并成为它自己的，因为它们通过外在途径或感官途径逐步被灌输进去。凡不经由快乐或愉悦进入的事物都不会固定在那里，从而存留下来。这就是从良善所获得的真理和从真理所得来的愉悦形式所表示的事，也是下文所论述的主题。</p>

<p align="center"><b>Potts(1905-1910) 3502</b></p><p><b>3502.</b>
And make me dainties, such as I have loved. That this signifies pleasant things from thence, because from good, is evident from the signification of "dainties" as being things pleasant; and because they 
came from Esau, by whom is represented the good of the natural, therefore they signify things pleasant because from good. In the original language "dainties" signify things that are delightful and 
pleasing to the taste; and in the internal sense they signify that which is delightful of good, and that which is pleasing of truth, because like the other bodily senses, the taste corresponds to celestial 
and spiritual things; concerning which correspondence, of the Lord's Divine mercy hereafter. It cannot be seen how the case herein is unless it is known in what manner the natural is made new, 
or receives life from the rational, that is, from the Lord through the rational. [2] The natural does not become new, or receive life corresponding to the rational, that is, is not regenerated, except 
by means of doctrinal things, or the knowledges of good and truth-the celestial man by the knowledges of good first, but the spiritual man by the knowledges of truth first. Doctrinal things, or the 
knowledges of good and truth, cannot be communicated to the natural man, thus cannot be conjoined and appropriated, except by means of delights and pleasantnesses accommodated to it, for they are insinuated 
by an external or sensuous way; and whatever does not enter by some delight or pleasantness does not inhere, thus does not continue.  This is what is meant by the truth of good and the pleasantness 
thereof, and this is what is treated of in what follows. </p>

<p align="center"><b>Elliott(1983-1999) 3502</b></p><p><b>3502.</b>
'And make me savoury food such as I love' means the forms of pleasantness received from that truth, because it is acquired from good. This is clear from the meaning of 'savoury food' as forms of pleasantness; 
and because that food was received from Esau who represents the good of the natural, that which is acquired from good is therefore meant. In the original language 'savoury food' refers to the 
forms of delight and pleasantness of taste, and means in the internal sense the delights which go with good and the forms of pleasantness which go with truth, the reason being that taste, as with all 
the other physical senses, corresponds to celestial and spiritual things - which correspondence will in the Lord's Divine mercy be dealt with later on. The situation in these matters does not become 
clear unless one knows how the natural is made new or receives life from the rational, that is, from the Lord by way of the rational. </p>
<p></p>
<p><b>[2]</b>
 The natural is not renewed, it does not receive a corresponding 
life from the rational - that is, it is not regenerated - except by means of matters of doctrine or cognitions of good and truth, the celestial man being regenerated by means primarily of cognitions 
of good, the spiritual man by means primarily of cognitions of truth. Matters of doctrine or cognitions of good and truth cannot be conveyed to the natural man, nor thus be joined to it and made 
its own, except through all delight and pleasantness that are appropriate for it, for they are instilled by the external way or that of the senses. Anything that does not enter in by way of some delight 
or pleasantness does not attach itself there and so does not remain. These are the factors meant by truth acquired from good, and the forms of pleasantness received from this truth. And it is these 
that are the subject in what follows. </p>

`Et fac mihi cupedias quemadmodum amavi':  quod significet amoena inde quia ex bono, constat a significatione `cupediarum' quod sint amoena, quae quia ex Esavo per quem repraesentatur bonum naturalis, 
est quia ex bono; (m)cupediae in lingua originali sunt jucunda et amoena saporis, et significant in sensu interno jucunda quae sunt boni et amoena quae sunt veri, ex causa quia sapor, sicut reliqui 
sensus {1}corporis, correspondent caelestibus et spiritualibus, de qua correspondentia, ex Divina Domini Misericordia, in sequentibus agendum.(n) Haec quomodo se habent, nec constare potest nisi sciatur 
quomodo naturale novum fit seu vitam accipit a rationali, hoc est, per rationale a Domino; [2] naturale non novum fit, seu vitam accipit rationali correspondentem, hoc est, regeneratur, nisi per doctrinalia 
seu cognitiones boni et veri, homo caelestis per cognitiones boni primum, at homo spiritualis per cognitiones veri primum; doctrinalia seu cognitiones boni et veri non possunt naturali homini 
communicari, ita nec (t)conjungi et appropriari nisi per jucunda et amoena illi accommodata, nam per viam externam seu sensualem insinuantur; quicquid non {2}per jucundum quoddam aut amoenum intrat, 
id non inhaeret, ita nec permanet; haec sunt quae significantur per boni verum et amoena inde, et haec sunt de quibus in sequentibus agitur. @1 i externi$  @2 A had per jucundum quoddam, d jucundum
