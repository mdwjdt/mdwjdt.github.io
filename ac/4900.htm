<h3 align="center" class="ired">属天的奥秘 第4900节</h3>
<h4 align="center"></h4><p><strong>4900.</strong>创世记38:24-26.约过了三个月，有人告诉犹大说，你的儿媳他玛作了妓女，并且，看哪，她因行淫有了身孕。犹大说，拉出她来，把她烧了！他玛被拉出来，便打发人去她公公那里，说，这些东西是哪一个人的，我就是从哪一个人怀的孕；她说，请你认一认，这印和带子并杖都是谁的？犹大承认说，她比我更有义，因为我没有将她给我的儿子示拉。从此犹大不再与她亲近了。<br />“约过了三个月”表一个新状态。“有人告诉犹大”表交流。“说，你的儿媳他玛作了妓女”表此时的一种觉知，即：若说他们之间存在任何婚姻之物，这是一种虚假。“并且，看哪，她因行淫有了身孕”表或说，有任何事物能由此被生出来。“犹大说”表存在于犹太民族当中的宗教表象的判决。“拉出她来，把她烧了”表它应被灭绝。“他玛被拉出来”表即将被处决。“便打发人去她公公那里”表一种暗示。“说，这些东西是哪一个人的，我就是从哪一个人怀的孕”表这种特征就包含在他们的宗教表象中。“她说，请你认一认，这印和带子并杖都是谁的”表以便人能凭这些信物认出它。“犹大承认”表因为这些是他们的，所以他们作出肯定。“说，她比我更有义”表外在与内在的结合不存在，只有内在与外在的结合存在。“因为我没有将她给我的儿子示拉”表因为外在就具有这样的性质。“从此犹大不再与她亲近了”表没有进一步的结合。</p>

Verses 24-26. And it came to pass about three months after, and it was told Judah, saying, Tamar thy daughter-in-law hath played the harlot; and, moreover, behold she is with child to whoredoms. And 
Judah said, Bring her forth, and let her be burnt. She was brought forth, and she sent to her father-in-law, saying, By the man whose these are am I with child; and she said, Acknowledge I pray whose 
are these, the signet and the kerchief and the staff. And Judah acknowledged them, and said, She is more just than I; forasmuch as I gave her not to Shelah my son. And he added no further to know her. 
"And it came to pass about three months after," signifies a new state; "and it was told Judah," signifies communication; "saying, Tamar thy daughter-in-law hath played the harlot," signifies perception 
then that it is false that anything conjugial exists between them; "and, moreover, behold she is with child to whoredoms," signifies and that anything can be produced thence; "and Judah said," signifies 
sentence from the religiosity in which the Jewish nation was; "Bring her forth, and let her be burnt," signifies that it ought to be extirpated; "she was brought forth," signifies that it was nearly 
effected; "and she sent to her father-in-law" signifies instilling; "saying, By the man whose these are, am I with child" signifies that such a quality was in their religiosity; "and she said, Acknowledge 
I pray whose are these, the signet and the kerchief and the staff," signifies that it might be known from the pledges; "and Judah acknowledged them," signifies that being theirs they made affirmation; 
"and said, She is more just than I," signifies that there was no conjunction of the external with the internal, but of the internal with the external; "forasmuch as I gave her not to Shelah 
my son," signifies because the external was of such a quality; "and he added no further to know her," signifies that there was no further conjunction. </p>

Verses 24-26 And so it was about three months later, that it was pointed out to Judah, saying, Tamar your daughter-in-law has committed whoredom, and also, behold, she is pregnant owing to acts of whoredom. 
And Judah said, Bring her out, and let her be burnt. She was brought out; and she sent to her father-in-law, saying, By the man to whom these belong I am pregnant. And she said, Acknowledge now 
to whom these belong, the seal and the cord and the rod. And Judah acknowledged them and said, She is more righteous than I am, seeing that I have not given her to Shelah my son. And he did not know 
her ever again. </p>
<p>'So it was about three months later' means a new state. 'That it was pointed out to Judah' means communication. 'Saying, Tamar your daughter-in-law has committed whoredom' means a 
perception at this point that to say anything of marriage exists between them is a falsity 'And also, behold, she is pregnant owing to acts of whoredom' means, or to say anything can be brought forth 
from this. 'And Judah said' means the verdict of the semblance of religion existing among the Jewish nation. 'Bring her out, and let her be burnt' means that it should be exterminated. 'She was brought 
out' means near to being carried out. 'And she sent to her father-in-law' means an intimation. 'Saying, By the man to whom these belong I am pregnant' means that this characteristic was contained in 
their semblance of religion. 'And she said, Acknowledge now to whom these belong, the seal and the cord and the rod' means that one could recognize it from the pledges. 'And Judah acknowledged them' 
means that because these were theirs they affirmed that they were. 'And said, She is more righteous than I am' means that no joining of what was external to what was internal existed, only what was internal 
to what was external. 'Seeing that I have not given her to Shelah my son' means because what was external was of such a nature. 'And he did not know her ever again' means that there was no further 
joining together. </p>

Vers. 24-26. Et fuit circiter a tribus mensibus, et indicatum Jehudae, dicendo, Scortata Tamar nurus tua et etiam ecce gravida; et dixit Jehudah, Educite illam, et comburatur. Illa educta, et illa 
misit ad socerum suum, dicendo, Viro, cui haec, ego gravida; et dixit, Agnosce quaeso, cui sigillum et panniculus et baculus, haec.  Et agnovit Jehudah, et dixit, Justa prae me, quia propterea quod 
non dedi illam Shelae filio meo; et non addidit amplius cognoscere illam. `Fuit circiter a tribus mensibus' significat statum novum: `et indicatum Jehudae' significat communicationem: `dicendo, 
Scortata Tamar nurus tua' significat perceptionem tunc quod falsum sit quod aliquod conjugiale intercedat: `et etiam ecce gravida ad scortationes' significat et quod inde aliquid produci queat: `et 
dixit Jehudah' significat sententiam a religioso in quo gens Judaica: `Educite illam et comburatur' significat quod exstirpandum: `illa educta' significat prope effectum: 'et illa misit ad socerum 
suum' significat insinuationem: 'dicendo, Viro, cui haec, ego gravida' significat quod religioso illorum tale inesset: `et dixit, Agnosce quaeso, cui sigillum et panniculus et baculus, haec' significat 
quod id cognosceretur ex pignoribus: `et agnovit Jehudah' significat quia suum quod affirmaret: `et dixit, Justa prae me' significat quod conjunctio externi cum interno nulla, sed interni cum 
externo: </p>
<p>`quia propterea quod non dedi illam Shelae filio meo' significat quia externum tale: `et non addidit amplius cognoscere illam' significat quod nulla conjunctio magis. </p>
