<h3 align="center" class="ired">属天的奥秘 第3242节</h3>
<h4 align="center"></h4><p><strong>3242.</strong>“米甸的儿子是以法、以弗、哈诺、亚比大和以勒大”表来自第三类的衍生物。这从“米甸”的代表清楚可知，“米甸”是指那些处于信之真理的人，如下文所述。既然那些处于信之真理的人是“米甸”，那么可知，他的儿子是由此而来的衍生物。至于那些处于信之真理的人，情况是这样：没有人被准许进入主的国度，除非他处于信之良善，因为信之良善就是信之生活。信之生活会保留下来，而信之教义却不会，除非它与生活合为一体。然而，处于信之真理的人，即宣称信，并视之为本质，因为他们就是如此被教导的人，也就是心里是基督徒，仅仅口头上不是的人，就在主的属灵国度。当信是本质这样的观点被老师传授给人，并且这人小时候就吸收这种观点时，他很容易被说服。他也被迫相信，因为那些最有学问的人，甚至教会领袖都是这么说的，其中有些人害怕谈论生活的良善，因为当生活成为标准时，他们会受到遣责。此外，属于信的事物以可察觉的方式流入，而那些属于仁的事物则不然。<br />因此，那些处于信之真理，然而也处于生活的良善之人被称为米甸。而他们所照之生活的真理则被称为“米甸的儿子”。正如那些处于与其良善结合的信之真理的人被称为“米甸”那样，在反面意义上，米甸也表示因缺乏生活的良善而处于虚假的人。这从以下经文可以看出来，以赛亚书：<br />成群的骆驼并米甸和以法的独峰驼必遮满你。示巴的众人都必来到，要奉上黄金乳香，又要传说耶和华的赞美。（以赛亚书<a href="http://39-27.cn/赛60.6.htm">60:6</a>）<br />这论及主的属灵国度。“米甸和以法的独峰驼”表教义。“黄金”表关于良善的教义，“乳香”表关于真理的教义，“耶和华的赞美”表这二者。由此也明显可知“以法”表示什么。把约瑟从坑里拉上来，把他卖给以实玛利人，后来带到埃及又卖给波提乏的米甸商人（创世记<a href="http://39-27.cn/创37.28.htm">37:28</a>，<a href="http://39-27.cn/创37.36.htm">36</a>）表示那些处于简单良善的真理之人。蒙主怜悯，这一点等到后面解释那几节经文时就能看到。<br />“米甸”还表示那些因缺乏生活的良善而处于虚假的人。这一点从摩西五经中有关米甸的内容可以看出来：<br />摩押的长老和米甸的长老手里拿着卦金到了巴兰那里，将巴勒的话都告诉了他。（民数记<a href="http://39-27.cn/民22.4.htm">22:4</a>，<a href="http://39-27.cn/民22.7.htm">7</a>等）<br />就好的意义而言，“摩押”表那些处于属世良善，并很容易使自己被误导的人；但就相反的意义而言，“摩押”表那些玷污良善的人（<a href="2468.htm">2468</a>节）。就好的意义而言，“米甸”表那些处于简单良善的真理，如前所述，因而很容易被说服的人；但就相反的意义而言，如此处，“米甸”表那些歪曲真理的人。“手里拿着卦金”表歪曲；他们打发人到巴兰那里与以色列人作对表来自这些虚假的行为，而以色列人表良善和源于这些良善的信之真理。<br />以色列人与摩押女子所行的淫乱导致瘟疫发生，非尼哈用枪将妓院里的米甸女人和以色列人由腹中刺透（民数记<a href="http://39-27.cn/民25.6.htm">25:6</a>-<a href="http://39-27.cn/民25.8.htm">8</a>）具有相同的含义，因为淫行代表对真理的歪曲（<a href="2466.htm">2466</a>，<a href="2729.htm">2729</a>节）。由于就内义而言，淫行表示对真理的歪曲，故一万二千以色列人按照吩咐击杀米甸人，杀了他们的王、所有男丁和他们所掳的、与男人同床共寝过的女人，并分了所夺来的财物（民数记<a href="http://39-27.cn/民25.16.htm">25:16</a>，<a href="http://39-27.cn/民25.17.htm">17</a>；<a href="http://39-27.cn/民31.1.htm">31:1</a>到末尾）。之所以有“一万二千”，是因为“十二”表信的一切事物（<a href="577.htm">577</a>，<a href="2089.htm">2089</a>，<a href="2129.htm">2129</a>，<a href="2130.htm">2130</a>节），虚假通过这些事物而被摧毁。他们所杀的“王”是指虚假，因而是“一切男丁”；“与男人同床共寝过的女人”是指对虚假的情感；“财物”（如金、银、牲畜）是指被歪曲的真理。由此明显可知，那里所提到的每一个事物都代表通过真理惩罚和摧毁虚假。<br />士师记中论到米甸人的事也一样，也就是说，以色列人因行了耶和华眼中看为恶的事，就被交在米甸人手里七年；以色列人因为米甸人而在山中给自己挖洞，还挖穴，建造营寨；每逢撒种之后，米甸人、亚玛力人和东方人都上来毁坏土产，后来他们被基甸和像狗一样用舌头舔水的三百人拯救，而那些跪下喝水的人则被打发回家；此外还有其它细节（士师记6，7，8章）。此处所提到的每一个细节都代表对真理的歪曲，以及由此而来的惩罚，直到它们被诸如“像狗一样用舌头舔水”所表示的那类事物摧毁。至于就内义而言，每一个细节表示什么，这在此解释起来太过冗长。蒙主怜悯，所有这一切将在适当地方予以论述。哈巴谷书：<br />他观看，赶散万族；永久的山崩裂，长存的岭塌陷。我见古珊的帐棚遭难，米甸地的帘子战兢。（哈巴谷书<a href="http://39-27.cn/哈3.6.htm">3:6</a>-<a href="http://39-27.cn/哈3.7.htm">7</a>）<br />这论述的是主的到来。“古珊的帐棚”表出于邪恶的宗教信仰，“米甸地的帘子”表出于虚假的宗教信仰。</p>

And the sons of Midian: Ephah, and Epher, and Hanoch, and Abida, and Eldaah. That this signifies the derivations from the third class, can be seen from the representation of Midian, as being those who 
are in the truth of faith (concerning which below); and as those who are in the truth of faith are "Midian," it follows that his "sons" are the derivations therefrom. With those who are in the truth 
of faith the case is this: No one is admitted into the Lord's kingdom unless he is in the good of faith, for the good of faith is of the life, and the life of faith remains, but not the doctrine of faith, 
except insofar as it makes one with the life; nevertheless they who are in the truth of faith (that is, who profess faith and call it essential, because they have so learned) and yet are in the 
good of life (that is, who are Christians in heart and not in profession only), are in the Lord's spiritual kingdom. For anyone may easily be persuaded that faith is the essential when he has been so 
taught by his instructors and has imbibed this opinion in his childhood, and because they who are reputed most learned and the heads of the church say so, some of whom are afraid to speak of the good 
of life because their life condemns them; moreover the things that belong to faith flow in perceptibly, but not so those which belong to charity. [2] They therefore who are in the truth of faith and 
yet in the good of life, are they who are called Midian;" and the truths according to which they live are the "sons of Midian;" and as those who are in the truth of faith conjoined with its good are "Midian," 
so also in the opposite sense are those who are in falsity from not having the good of life, as can be seen from the following passages. In Isaiah: </p>
<p>     The abundance of camels shall cover thee, 
the dromedaries of Midian and Ephah, all they from Sheba shall come; they shall bring gold and frankincense, and they shall proclaim the praises of Jehovah (Isa. 60:6); </p>
<p>where the Lord's spiritual 
kingdom is treated of. The "dromedaries of Midian and Ephah" denote doctrinal things; doctrinal things of good are "gold;" those of truth are "frankincense;" both are the "praises of Jehovah;" hence 
also it is manifest what "Ephah" signifies. (That by the "Midianites" who drew Joseph out of the pit, and sold him to the Ishmaelites, and into Egypt to Potiphar, Genesis 37:28, 36, are signified those 
who are in the truth of simple good, will be seen, of the Lord's Divine mercy, in the explication of these verses hereafter.) [3] That by "Midian" are also signified those who are in falsity because 
they have not the goods of life, can be seen from what is said concerning Midian in Moses: </p>
<p>     The elders of Moab and the elders of Midian, with the rewards of divination in their hand, went to Balaam, 
and spake to him the words of Balak (Num. 22:4, 7, etc.). In a good sense "Moab" denotes those who are in natural good and suffer themselves to be easily led astray; but in the opposite sense, 
those who adulterate goods (n. 2468). In a good sense "Midian" denotes those who are in the truth of simple good, as before said, and who thus allow themselves to be easily persuaded; in the opposite 
sense, as here, those who falsify truths. The falsifications are signified by "the rewards of divination in their hand;" and the deeds from these falsities, by their sending to Balaam in hostility to 
the sons of Israel, who denote the goods and derivative truths of faith.  [4] The like was signified by the whoredoms of the sons of Israel with the women of the Midianites, resulting in a plague, which 
was stayed by Phinehas thrusting his spear through the Midianitish woman and the man of Israel in the brothel (Num. 25:6-8); for by whoredoms were represented the falsifications of truth (n. 2466, 
2729). And because falsifications of truth are what in the internal sense are signified by whoredoms, therefore by command twelve thousand of the sons of Israel smote the Midianites, slew their kings, 
and every male, and the women whom they had led captive that had known a man, and divided the spoil among themselves (Num. 25:16, 17; 31:1 to the end). The reason why there were twelve thousand, was 
that "twelve" signified all things of faith (n. 577, 2089, 2129, 2130), by which falsities are destroyed; the "kings" whom they killed are falsities, and so is "every male;" the "women that had known 
a man" are the affections of falsity; the "spoil" (as gold, silver, cattle) are the truths that were falsified; from all which it is evident that each and all of the things there mentioned are representative 
of the punishment and destruction of what is false by means of truths. [5] It is similar in regard to what is said of the Midianites in the book of Judges, namely, that the sons of Israel, because 
they did evil in the eyes of Jehovah, were given into the hand of Midian seven years; and that the sons of Israel, by reason of Midian, made for themselves caves in the mountains, and also dens, 
and fortified places; and when Israel had sown, that Midian and Amalek and the sons of the east came up and ravaged the produce of their land; and afterwards that they were delivered by Gideon with 
three hundred men who lapped water with the tongue like a dog, and that those were sent home who bowed upon the knees and drank, besides other particulars (chapters 6, 7, 8). Here also the things mentioned 
each and all are representative of the falsification of truth, and of punishment on this account, even to their being destroyed by such things as are signified by lapping water with the tongue like 
a dog; but what each particular signifies in the internal sense it would be too tedious to unfold here; yet of the Lord's Divine mercy it shall be told in, its place. In Habakkuk: </p>
<p>     He beheld, 
and dispersed the nations; and the eternal mountains* were scattered, the everlasting hills did bow. I saw the tents of Cushan under Aven, the curtains of the land of Midian did tremble (Hab. 3:6-7); </p>
<p>where 
the advent of the Lord is treated of. The "tents of Cushan" denote a religiosity from evil; the "curtains of the land of Midian," one from falsity. * Literally, "the mountains of time." </p>

<p align="center"><b>Elliott(1983-1999) 3242</b></p><p><b>3242.</b>
'And the sons of Midian, Ephah and Epher, and Enoch, and Abida, and Eldaah' means the derivatives from the third division. This becomes clear from the representation of 'Midian' as those governed by 
the truth of faith, to be dealt with below; and since those governed by the truth of faith are 'Midian', it follows that 'sons' are derivatives from it. With regard to those governed by the truth of faith 
the position is that no one is admitted into the Lord's kingdom except him with whom the good of faith is present since the good of faith is the life of faith. The life of faith remains, but not 
the doctrine of faith except insofar as it makes one with life. Nevertheless people governed by the truth of faith, that is, who profess faith and refer to it as the essential thing because they have 
been taught that it is, but who, in spite of that teaching have goodness of life, that is, who are Christians in their hearts and not just on their lips, are in the Lord's spiritual kingdom. For anyone 
can easily be made to believe that faith is the essential thing if such an idea is handed on to him by teachers and at an early age he becomes steeped in that way of thinking. He is also made to believe 
because those who are reputed to be very learned, even church-leaders, say the same, some of whom are afraid to talk about the good of life because when life is the criterion they stand condemned, 
and also - in addition - because matters of faith, when they display themselves, are perceptible, whereas matters of charity are less so. Those therefore who are governed by the truth of faith, and 
yet also by the good of life are called Midian. But the truths which govern their lives are 'the sons of Midian'. </p>
<p></p>
<p><b>[2]</b>
 Just as those in whom the truth of faith is joined to the good of that faith are 
meant by Midian so also in the contrary sense Midian means those under the influence of falsity because the good of life is lacking in them - as becomes clear from the following: In Isaiah, </p>
<blockquote>
A drove 
of camels will cover you, dromedaries of Midian and Ephah; all those from Sheba will come. They will bring gold and frankincense, and will proclaim the praises of Jehovah. <a href="http://bible.gospelcom.net/cgi-bin/bible?passage=Isa%2060:6&amp;version=ESV&amp;interface=print&amp;showfn=yes&amp;showxref">Isa 60:6</a>. 
</blockquote>
<p>This refers 
to the Lord's spiritual kingdom. 'Dromedaries of Midian and Ephah' stands for matters of doctrine. Matters of doctrine concerning good are meant by 'gold', those concerning truth by 'frankincense'; and 
both by 'the praises of Jehovah'. From this also it is evident what 'Ephah' means. 'The Midianites' who pulled Joseph out of the pit and sold him to Ishmaelites, and to Potiphar in Egypt, <a href="http://bible.gospelcom.net/cgi-bin/bible?passage=Gen%2037:28,%2036&amp;version=ESV&amp;interface=print&amp;showfn=yes&amp;showxref">Gen 37:28, 36</a>, means people governed by truth coupled to simple good, as will in the Lord's Divine mercy be seen later on when those verses are dealt with.  </p>
<p></p>
<p><b>[3]</b>
 As regards 'Midian' also meaning those under 
the influence of falsity because the good of life is lacking in them, this may be seen from what is said about Midian in Moses, </p>
<p>The elders of Moab and the elders of Midian with deceptions in their 
hand came to Balaam and spoke to him the words of Balak. <a href="http://bible.gospelcom.net/cgi-bin/bible?passage=Num%2022:4,%207&amp;version=ESV&amp;interface=print&amp;showfn=yes&amp;showxref">Num 22:4, 7</a>, and following verses. </p>
<p>In the good sense 'Moab' stands for people with whom natural good exists and who easily allow themselves 
to be misled, but in the contrary sense stands for those who adulterate goods, <a href="2468.htm">2468</a>. 'Midian' in the good sense, as has been stated, stands for those who are governed by truth coupled to simple good, 
and so who are easily led to believe things, but in the contrary sense, as here, stands for those who falsify truths. Falsifications are meant by 'deceptions in their hand', and deeds which are the 
product of falsities by their sending to Balaam to act against the children of Israel, who are the goods, and from these the truths, of faith.  </p>
<p></p>
<p><b>[4]</b>
 The acts of whoredom committed by the sons of Israel 
with Midianite women which brought about the plague that Phinehas checked by running through with his spear the Midianite woman and the Israelite man in the brothel, <a href="http://bible.gospelcom.net/cgi-bin/bible?passage=Num%2025:6-8&amp;version=ESV&amp;interface=print&amp;showfn=yes&amp;showxref">Num 25:6-8</a>, and following verses, 
has a similar meaning, for acts of whoredom represented falsifications of truth, <a href="2466.htm">2466</a>, <a href="2729.htm">2729</a>. And because falsifications of truth are what are meant in the internal sense by acts of whoredom, therefore 
by command twelve thousand of the children of Israel assailed them, killed their kings, all the males, and the women they had taken captive who had had carnal knowledge of a man, and divided the 
booty among themselves, <a href="http://bible.gospelcom.net/cgi-bin/bible?passage=Num%2025:16,%2017;%2031:1-end&amp;version=ESV&amp;interface=print&amp;showfn=yes&amp;showxref">Num 25:16, 17; 31:1-end</a>. The reason why 'twelve thousand' were involved was that 'twelve' means all things of faith, <a href="577.htm">577</a>, <a href="2089.htm">2089</a>, <a href="2129.htm">2129</a> (end), <a href="2130.htm">2130</a> (end), by means of which falsities 
are destroyed. 'The kings' they killed are falsities, as also are 'the males', 'the women who had had carnal knowledge of a man' are affections for falsity, and 'the booty' which consisted of gold, 
silver, and cattle, are truths that have been falsified. From this it is evident that every single thing mentioned there is representative of the punishment and destruction of falsity by means of 
truths. </p>
<p></p>
<p><b>[5]</b>
 The same is meant by the facts related about the Midianites in the Book of Judges, </p>
<p>Because the children of Israel did evil in the eyes of Jehovah they were given into the hand of Midian 
for seven years. </p>
<p>On account of Midian the children of Israel made dens for themselves in the mountains, also caves, and strongholds. And whenever Israel put in seed, Midian and Amalek and the sons 
of the east came up and destroyed the produce of their land. </p>
<p>After that they were liberated by Gideon by means of the three hundred who had lapped water with their tongue like a dog, whereas those 
who had sunk down on their knees to drink had been sent home. </p>
<p>Further references to them, in addition to these, are made in Chapters <a href="6.htm">6</a>-<a href="8.htm">8</a>. </p>
<p>Here too every single detail is representative of the 
falsification of truth, and on that account of punishment even to the point of their being destroyed by the kind of things meant by 'lapping water with their tongue like a dog'. But what each detail 
means in the internal sense would take too long to explain here. All this will in the Lord's Divine mercy be dealt with in its proper place. In Habakkuk, </p>
<blockquote>
He looked and scattered the nations, and the 
mountains of time were dissolved, and the hills of old sank down. Below Aven I saw the tents of Cushan, the curtains of the land of Midian trembled. <a href="http://bible.gospelcom.net/cgi-bin/bible?passage=Hab%203:6,%207&amp;version=ESV&amp;interface=print&amp;showfn=yes&amp;showxref">Hab 3:6, 7</a>. 
</blockquote>
<p>This refers to the Coming of the 
Lord. 'The tents of Cushan' stands for a religion raised up out of evil, 'the curtains of the land of Midian' for a religion raised up out of falsity. </p>

<p>ubi de regno spirituali Domini, `dromades Midianis et Ephae' pro doctrinalibus; doctrinalia boni sunt `aurum,' doctrinalia veri sunt `tus,' 
utraque sunt `laudes Jehovae'; inde etiam patet, {6}quid Ephah significat. Quod per `Midianitas' qui extraxerunt Josephum e fovea, ac vendiderunt Jishmaelitis, (c)et in Aegyptum Potiphari, Gen. xxxvii 
28, 36, significentur illi qui in vero simplicis boni, videbitur, ex Divina Domini Misericordia, in sequentibus ad versus illos. [3] Quod etiam per `Midianem' significentur illi qui in falso, quia 
{7}bonum vitae non illis, constare potest ex illis quae de Midiane apud Mosen dicuntur, quod nempe,           Seniores Moab et seniores Midianis, cum praestigiis in      manu, iverint ad Bileamum, et 
locuti sint ad illum verba      Balaki, Num. xxii 4, 7, seq. `Moabus' in bono sensu pro illis qui in bono naturali sunt et se facile seduci patiuntur, at in opposito pro illis qui adulterant bona, 
n. 2468; `Midian' bono sensu pro illis qui in vero simplicis boni, ut dictum, (c)et ita se facile persuaderi sinunt; in opposito, ut hic, pro illis qui falsificant vera; falsificationes significantur

quas plaga, quae sedata per quod Pinhasus transfoderit Midianitidem et virum Israelis in lupanari; Num. xxv 6-8, seq., simile significant, nam per `scortationes' repraesentabantur falsificationes 
veri, n. 2466, 2729; et quia falsificatione veri {9}sunt quae in sensu interno significantur per scortationes, ideo ex mandato,           Duodecim mille ex filiis Israelis percusserunt illos,
