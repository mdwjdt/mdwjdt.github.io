Verses 25, 26,* 27, 28, 29. And seven days were fulfilled after that Jehovah had smitten the river. And Jehovah said unto Moses, Come unto Pharaoh, and say unto him, Thus saith Jehovah, Let My people 
go, that they may serve Me. And if thou refuse to let them go, behold I will smite all thy border with frogs; and the river shall make frogs to creep forth, and they shall go up and come into thy house, 
and into thy bed-chamber, and upon thy bed, and into the house of thy servants and of thy people,* and into thine ovens, and into thy kneading-troughs; and on thee, and on thy people, and on all thy 
servants, shall the frogs come up. "And seven days were fulfilled after that Jehovah had smitten the river," signifies the end of that state after truths had been falsified; "and Jehovah said unto 
Moses" signifies new instruction "Come unto Pharaoh, and say unto him," signifies a command to those who infest; "Thus saith Jehovah, Let My people go, that they may serve Me," signifies that they should 
leave those who are of the church to worship their God in freedom; "and if thou refuse to let them go," signifies if they would not leave them; "behold I will smite all thy border with frogs," signifies 
reasonings from mere falsities; "and the river shall make frogs to creep forth," signifies that there will be reasonings from these falsities; and they shall go up and come into thy house, and 
into thy bedchamber," signifies that they shall fill the mind even to its interiors; "and upon thy bed," signifies to the inmosts; "and into the house of thy servants, and of thy people," signifies all 
things that are in the natural; "and into thine ovens, and into thy kneadingtroughs," signifies into the delights of cupidities; "and on thee, and on thy people, and on all thy servants, shall the frogs 
come up," signifies that reasonings from falsities shall be in all things both in general and in particular. * Numbered as in the Hebrew in the English text Chapter VIII. begins with this verse. ** 
Et in populum tuum, but et populi tui below. </p>

Vers. 25-29.  Et impleti septem dies postquam percutere Jehovah fluvium.  {1}Et dixit Jehovah ad Moschen, Veni ad Pharaonem, et dices ad illum, Ita dicit Jehovah, Mitte populum Meum, et serviant Mihi. 
 Et si renuis tu mittere, ecce Ego afficiam omnem terminum tuum ranis.  Et prorepere faciet fluvius ranas, et ascendent et venient in domum tuam, et in conclave cubilis tui, et super lectum tuum, et 
in domum servorum tuorum, et {2}in populum tuum, et in clibanos tuos, et in mactras tuas.  Et in te, et in populum tuum, et in omnes servos tuos, ascendent ranae.  `Et impleti septem dies postquam percutere 
Jehovah fluvium' significat finem status illius postquam vera falsificata: `et dixit Jehovah ad Moschen' significat novam instructionem: `Veni ad Pharaonem, et dices ad illum' significat mandatum 
ad infestantes: `Ita dicit Jehovah, Mitte populum Meum ut serviant Mihi' significat ut relinquant illos qui ab Ecclesia ut in libero Deum suum colant: `et si renuis tu mittere' significat si non 
relinquerent: `ecce Ego afficiam omnem terminum tuum ranis' significat ratiocinia ex meris falsis: `et prorepere faciet fluvius ranas' significat quod ratiocinia ex falsis illis: `et ascendent et venient 
in domum tuam, et in conclave cubilis tui' significat quod implebunt mentem usque ad interiora ejus: `et super lectum tuum' significat ad intima: `et in domum servorum tuorum, et {2}populi tui' significat 
omnia quae in naturali: `et in clibanos tuos, et in mactras tuas' significat in jucunda cupiditatum: `et in te, et in populum tuum, et in omnes servos tuos, ascendent ranae' significat quod ratiocinia 
ex falsis erunt in omnibus et singulis. 	@1 AV viii 1 begins here$ 	@2 See p. 304 footnote 2, which reads: S first wrote in populum tuum then altered to populi tui but did not d in I has in 
populi tui here.  cp n. 7345 lines 7 and 4e and n. 7355.$ </p>
