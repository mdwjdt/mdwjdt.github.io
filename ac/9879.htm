<h3 align="center" class="ired">属天的奥秘 第9879节</h3>
<h4 align="center"></h4><p><strong>9879.</strong>“要在胸牌上，在边上作小链子”表在最外在部分联结在一起的整个天堂。这从“胸牌”、“小链子”和“边”的含义清楚可知：“胸牌”是指从主的神性良善发出的神性真理（参看<a href="9823.htm">9823</a>节），因而也指天堂，如下文所述；“小链子”是指连贯，如前所述（<a href="9852.htm">9852</a>节），因而也指联结；“边”是指最外在部分，也如前所述（<a href="9853.htm">9853</a>节）。“胸牌”也表示天堂的原因是，十二块石头和十二支派的名字代表那里整体上的一切良善和真理；整体上的良善和真理构成天堂，并且构成得如此彻底，以至于无论你说天堂，还是说这些良善和真理，都是一回事。因为构成天堂的天使是来自主的良善和真理的接受者；他们因是这些的接受者，故也是它们的形式，这些形式是爱与仁的形式。信之真理造就美丽，不过，这美丽与源于良善的真理一致，也就是与良善闪耀出来所经由的真理一致。爱与仁的外在形式，就是诸如天上天使的形式，是人的形式，因为从主发出并被天使接受的良善和真理是主的样式和形像。</p>

And thou shalt make upon the breastplate chains of the border. That this signifies the conjunction of the whole heaven in the extremes, is evident from the signification of "the breastplate," as being 
the Divine truth that proceeds from the Lord's Divine good (see n. 9823), thus also heaven (of which in what follows); from the signification of "the chains," as being coherence (see above, n. 9852), 
thus also conjunction; and from the signification of "the border," as being what is outermost or extreme (as also above, n. 9853). That "the breastplate" also denotes heaven, is because all goods and 
truths in the complex were there represented by the twelve stones, and by the names of the twelve tribes; and goods and truths in the complex constitute heaven, insomuch that whether we say heaven, 
or these goods and truths, it is the same thing. For the angels who constitute heaven are receptions of good and truth from the Lord; and as they are receptions of these, they are also forms of them, 
which forms are those of love and charity. The truths of faith make beauty, but a beauty that is according to truths from good; that is, according to truths through which good shines. The forms of love 
and charity, such as are those of the angels in the heavens, are human forms, for the reason that the goods and truths which proceed from the Lord, and of which the angels are receptions, are likenesses 
and images of the Lord. </p>

'And you shall make on the breastplate small chains on the border' means all heaven joined together in the most external parts. This is clear from the meaning of 'the breastplate' as Divine Truth emanating 
from the Lord's Divine Good, dealt with in <a href="9823.htm">9823</a>, thus also heaven, dealt with below; from the meaning of 'small chains' as coherence, dealt with above in <a href="9852.htm">9852</a>, thus also a joining together; and 
from the meaning of 'the border' as the most external part, as also above in <a href="9853.htm">9853</a>. The reason why 'the breastplate' means heaven as well is that all the kinds of good and truth in their entirety were 
represented there by the twelve stones and by the names of the twelve tribes; and those kinds of good and truth in their entirety constitute heaven, so completely that whether you say heaven or those 
kinds of good and truth it amounts to the same thing. For the angels who constitute heaven are recipients of good and truth from the Lord, and being recipients of these they are also forms of them, or 
forms of love and charity. Truths of faith make for beauty, but a beauty in keeping with truths that spring from good, that is, in keeping with truths through which good shines forth. Outward forms 
of love and charity, which is what the forms of angels in the heavens are, are human forms; they are such because the kinds of good and the truths which emanate from the Lord, and the angels are recipients 
of, are effigies and images of the Lord.  </p>

`Et facies super pectorali catenulas termini': quod significet conjunctionem totius caeli in extremis, constat ex significatione `pectoralis' quod sit Divinum Verum {1}procedens ex Divino Bono Domini,de 
qua n. 9823, ita quoque caelum, de qua sequitur, ex significatione `catenularum' quod sint cohaerentia, de qua supra n. 9852, ita quoque conjunctio, et ex significatione `termini' quod sit extremum, 
ut quoque supra n. 9853.  Quod pectorale etiam sit caelum, est quia omnia bona et vera in complexu ibi repraesentata sunt per duodecim lapides, et per nomina duodecim tribuum, et bona et vera in complexu 
constituunt caelum, usque adeo ut sive dicas caelum sive illa, idem sit; angeli enim, qui caelum constituunt, sunt receptiones boni et veri a Domino, (m)et quia sunt receptiones illorum, etiam 
sunt formae illorum quae sunt formae amoris et charitatis; vera fidei faciunt pulchritudinem {2}, sed {3}pulchritudinem secundum vera ex bono, {4}hoc est, secundum vera per quae elucet bonum;(n) formae 
amoris et charitatis, quales sunt angelorum in caelis, sunt formae humanae; causa est quia bona et vera quae procedunt ex Domino, et quorum receptiones sunt angeli, sunt effigies et imagines Domini. @1
