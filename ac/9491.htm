<h3 align="center" class="ired">属天的奥秘 第9491节</h3>
<h4 align="center"></h4><p><strong>9491.</strong>“内外都要把它包上”表各处。这从“内外”的含义清楚可知，“内外”是指各处，也就是说，四围，因为经上说你要“把它包上”。事实上，用金包裹的内部材料是皂荚木，“皂荚木”表示从主的神性人身发出的良善本身（参看<a href="9472.htm">9472</a>，<a href="9486.htm">9486</a>节）。里外都有金子，而金也表示良善，不过是诸如出现在感官面前的那类，因而相对外在。“里外四围”各处当论及“约柜”所表示的天堂时，表示总体的天堂和具体的一切天堂社群；“外”表示总体的天堂，“内”表示天堂社群，因为它们在天堂里面。</p>

<p align="center"><b>Potts(1905-1910) 9491</b></p><p><b>9491.</b>
From within and from without shalt thou overlay it. That this signifies everywhere, is evident from the signification of "within and without," as being everywhere, namely, round about; because it is 
said, "thou shalt overlay it." For within there was shittim wood, which was overlaid with gold, and by "shittim wood" is signified the good itself that proceeds from the Divine Human of the Lord (see 
n. 9472, 9486); but from without and from within there was gold, by which is also signified good, but such good as appears before the senses, thus relatively external. By "everywhere round about, from 
within and from without," when said of heaven which is signified by "the ark," is meant heaven in general, and every heavenly society in particular; heaven in general is meant by "from without," and 
the heavenly societies by "from within," because they are within heaven. </p>

<p align="center"><b>Elliott(1983-1999) 9491</b></p><p><b>9491.</b>
'On the inside and on the outside you shall overlay it' means everywhere. This is clear from the meaning of 'on the inside and on the outside' as everywhere, that is to say, round about since it says 
'you shall overlay it'. For the inner material that was overlaid with gold was shittim wood, and 'shittim wood' means the good itself that proceeds from the Lord's Divine Human, <a href="9472.htm">9472</a>, <a href="9486.htm">9486</a>. But on the 
outside and on the inside there was gold, which too means good, but such as appears to the senses, and so in comparison is external. By everywhere round about, 'on the inside and on the outside' - when 
these words have reference to heaven, meant by 'the ark' - heaven in general and every heavenly community in particular are meant, heaven in general being meant by 'on the outside' and heavenly communities 
by 'on the inside' since they lie within heaven.  </p>

</p><b>9491.</b>
`Ab intra et ab extra obduces illam': quod significet ubivis, constat a significatione `ab intra et ab extra' quod sit ubivis, nempe circumcirca, nam dicitur `obduces illam'; intus enim erat lignum 
schittim, quod obducebatur auro, et per `lignum schittim' significatur ipsum bonum procedens a Divino Humano Domini, n. 9472, 9486; {1}ab extra autem et ab intra erat aurum, per quod etiam significatur 
bonum, sed tale quod coram sensu apparet; ita respective externum. Per ubivis circum circa ab intra et ab extra, cum de caelo, quod per arcam significatur, intelligitur caelum in communi, et {2}omnis 
societas caelestis in particulari; caelum in communi est ab extra, et societates {3}caelestes sunt ab intra, quia {4} sunt intra caelum. @1 extus autem circumcirca, tam ab intra quam extra$ @2 quoque 
societates coelestes$ @3 in particulari$ @4 i hae$ </p>
