<h3 align="center" class="ired">属天的奥秘 第495节</h3>
<h4 align="center"></h4><p><strong>495.</strong>除非知道何为直觉，否则就弄不清上古教会如何变得衰败，因为赋予教会的直觉如今已不复存在。上古教会的直觉在于：他们通过主直觉何为善与真，就象天使那样；与其说是对民间社会的善与真的直觉，不如说是对源自爱主信主的善与真的直觉。它不是人的信仰告白，而是被其生活所确证的告白，这告白清楚表明了直觉的性质，以及它是否存在。</p>

<p><strong>[NCE]495.</strong> No one can see in what way the earliest church waned without knowing what perception is, since that church was perceptive in a way that none today is. A church's perception consists in a gift from the Lord for perceiving good and truth as the angels do. The good and truth perceived are not so much those of public life as those having to do with love for the Lord and faith in him. What we profess to believe, as confirmed by the way we live, indicates what kind of perception we have, and whether we have any at all. </p>
<p align="center"><b>Potts(1905-1910) 495</b></p><p><b>495.</b>
How the Most Ancient Church decreased cannot appear unless it be known what perception is, for it was a perceptive church, such as at this day does not exist. The perception of a church consists in this, 
that its members perceive from the Lord what is good and true, like the angels; not so much what the good and truth of civic society is, but the good and truth of love to the Lord and of faith in 
Him. From a confession of faith that is confirmed by the life it can be seen what perception is, and whether it has any existence. </p>

How the Most Ancient Church declined does not become clear unless it is known what perception is, for it was a Church gifted with perceptivity, such as does not exist nowadays. The perception of that 
Church consists in their perceiving from the Lord what good and truth are, as angels do It is not so much a perception of the good and truth of civil society, but the good and truth deriving from love 
to the Lord and faith in Him. It is a person's profession of faith, a profession confirmed by his life, that makes clear the nature of perception and whether it exists at all.  </p>

</p><b>495.</b>
Quomodo Antiquissima Ecclesia decrevit, non constare potest nisi sciatur quid perceptio, nam Ecclesia perceptiva fuit qualis hodie nulla datur.  Perceptio Ecclesiae constat in eo ut percipiant a Domino 
quid bonum et verum, sicut angeli; non ita quid bonum et verum societatis civilis, sed quid bonum et verum amoris et fidei in Dominum; ex confessione fidei confirmata ex vita, constare potest qualis 
sit et num sit. </p>
