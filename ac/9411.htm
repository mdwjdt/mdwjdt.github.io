<h3 align="center" class="ired">属天的奥秘 第9411节</h3>
<h4 align="center"></h4><p><strong>9411.</strong>“他们观看神”表信。这从“观看神”的含义清楚可知，“观看神”是指被赋予聪明和信仰。“观看”在内义上表示以属灵的方式观看，以属灵的方式观看意味着出于信仰观看；这就是为何在圣言中，“看”表示拥有信（<a href="2325.htm">2325</a>，<a href="3863.htm">3863</a>，<a href="3869.htm">3869</a>，<a href="4403.htm">4403</a>-<a href="4421.htm">4421</a>，<a href="5400.htm">5400</a>，<a href="6805.htm">6805</a>，<a href="9128.htm">9128</a>节）。他们之所以观看以色列的神，也就是主，是因为从广泛意义上说，从西乃山上所颁布的律法表示整体上的圣言；圣言就是发自主的神性真理，这真理在至高意义上唯独论述主。正因如此，那些阅读圣言时获得启示或光照的人就看见主；他们看见主是由于他们所拥有的信和爱。他们只在圣言中，而不在其它任何着作中看见主。由此明显可知为何摩西、亚伦、拿答、亚比户，以及七十个长老看见主。看见主的是这些人，而不是分别出来的以色列人，这一点从前面第9、10节经文明显看出来；在那里，经上说“摩西，亚伦，拿答，亚比户，并以色列长老中的七十人都上去，他们看见以色列的神”；在本节，经上说“祂不伸手在分别出来的以色列人身上”。看见神的，之所以是前者，而不是后者，是因为“摩西和亚伦”代表内在和外在意义上的圣言（<a href="9374.htm">9374</a>节），“拿答和亚比户”代表源于这两层意义的教义（<a href="9375.htm">9375</a>节），“七十个老长”代表所有处于由从那里获得的真理所产生的良善之人（<a href="9376.htm">9376</a>，<a href="9404.htm">9404</a>节），而“被分别出出来的以色列人”则代表那些局限于脱离内在意义的圣言外在意义的人。</p>

And they saw God. That this signifies faith, is evident from the signification of "seeing God," as being to be endowed with intelligence and faith; for in the internal sense "to see" denotes to see spiritually; 
and to see spiritually is to see from faith; hence it is that in the Word "to see" signifies to have faith (n. 2325, 3863, 3869, 4403-4421, 5400, 6805, 9128). That they saw the God of Israel, 
that is, the Lord, is because the laws promulgated from Mount Sinai signify in a wide sense the Word in its whole complex; and the Word is Divine truth from the Lord, which in its supreme sense treats 
of the Lord alone. Wherefore they who are in enlightenment when reading the Word, see the Lord; and this takes place from faith and from love. This is effected in the Word alone, and not in any other 
writing whatever. From this it is plain why Moses, Aaron, Nadab, and Abihu, and the seventy elders, saw the Lord. That He was seen by them, and not by the sons of Israel who were set apart, is plain 
from verses 9 and 10 which precede; for it is there said that "Moses went up, and Aaron, Nadab, and Abihu, and seventy of the elders of Israel, and they saw the God of Israel;" and in this verse, 
"and unto the sons of Israel who were set apart He sent not His hand." The reason why the former saw God, and not the latter, was that Moses and Aaron represented the Word as to the internal and the external 
senses (n. 9374), and Nadab and Abihu represented doctrine from both (n. 9375), and the seventy elders represented all who are in good from the truths thence derived (n. 9376, 9404), but the sons 
of Israel who were set apart represented those who are in the external sense of the Word separate from the internal. </p>

'And they saw God' means faith. This is clear from the meaning of 'seeing God' as being endowed with intelligence and faith. 'Seeing' in the internal sense means seeing in a spiritual manner, and seeing 
in a spiritual manner implies seeing with the gift of faith; this is why 'seeing' in the Word means having faith, <a href="2325.htm">2325</a>, <a href="3863.htm">3863</a>, <a href="3869.htm">3869</a>, <a href="4403.htm">4403</a>-<a href="4421.htm">4421</a>, <a href="5400.htm">5400</a>, <a href="6805.htm">6805</a>, <a href="9128.htm">9128</a>. The reason why they saw the God of 
Israel, that is, the Lord, is that in a broad sense the laws declared from Mount Sinai mean the Word in its entirety, and the Word is Divine Truth from the Lord, which deals in its highest sense with 
the Lord alone. All this being so, those who receive enlightenment when they read the Word see the Lord; they do so because of the faith and the love they have. They see Him solely in the Word and in 
no other writing whatever. From this it is evident why Moses, Aaron, Nadab and Abihu, and the seventy elders saw Him. The fact that these saw Him and not the children of Israel who had been set apart 
is evident from the preceding verses 9 and <a href="10.htm">10</a>, which say, 'Moses and Aaron went up, Nadab and Abihu, and seventy of the elders of Israel. And they saw the God of Israel', and the present verse says, 'And 
on the children of Israel who had been set apart He did not lay a hand'. The reason why the former saw God and not the latter was that 'Moses and Aaron' represented the Word in respect of its inward 
and outward senses, <a href="9374.htm">9374</a>, 'Nadab and Abihu' teachings derived from both senses, <a href="9375.htm">9375</a>, and 'the seventy elders' all who are governed by good which results from truths received from there, <a href="9376.htm">9376</a>, <a href="9404.htm">9404</a>, 
whereas 'the children of Israel who had been set apart' represented those who are restricted to the outward sense of the Word, separated from the inward.  </p>

`Et viderunt Deum': quod significet fidem, constat ex significatione `videre Deum' quod sit donari intelligentia et fide; `videre' enim in sensu interno est spiritualiter videre, et spiritualiter videre 
est ex fide videre; inde est quod `videre' in Verbo significet fidem habere, n. 2325, 3863, 3869, 4403-4421, 5400, 6805, 9128. Quod viderint Deum Israelis, hoc est, Dominum, est quia leges {1}promulgatae 
e monte Sinai in lato sensu significant Verbum in toto complexu, et Verbum est Divinum Verum a Domino, quod in supremo sensu agit de solo Domino; quapropter illi qui in illustratione sunt cum 
legunt Verbum, vident Dominum, {2}quod fit ex fide et ex amore; hoc fit in solo Verbo et non in alio quocumque scripto; inde patet cur Moscheh, Aharon, Nadab et Abihu, et septuaginta seniores viderint 
Ipsum; quod hi viderint Ipsum et non sepositi filii Israelis, patet a vers. 9 et 10 praecedente, nam ibi dicitur quod `ascenderit Moscheh et Aharon, Nadab et Abihu, et septuaginta ex senioribus Israelis 
et viderunt Deum Israelis,' et in hoc versu, `Et ad sepositos filios Israelis non misit manum'; quod illi viderint Deum et non hi, erat causa quia `Moscheh et Aharon' repraesentabant Verbum quoad 
sensum internum et externum, n. 9374, et `Nadab et Abihu' doctrinam ex utroque, n. 9375, (c)et `septuaginta seniores' omnes qui {3}in bono ex veris inde, n. 9376, 9404; `sepositi' autem {4}`filii Israelis'
