Verses 4-6. And Moses cried unto Jehovah, saying, What shall I do to this people? a little more and they stone me. And Jehovah said unto Moses, Pass on before the people, and take with thee of the elders 
of Israel; and thy rod, wherewith thou smotest the river, take in thine hand, and go. Behold, I stand before thee there upon the rock in Horeb; and thou shalt smite the rock, and there shall come 
waters out of it, that the people may drink. And Moses did so before the eyes of the elders of Israel. "And Moses cried unto Jehovah, saying," signifies interior lamentation and intercession; "What shall 
I do to this people?" signifies for those who are in a complaining so grievous on account of the non-reception of truth; "a little more and they stone me," signifies that they are not far from doing 
violence to truth from the Divine; "and Jehovah said unto Moses," signifies aid; "Pass on before the people," signifies that He should lead and teach them; "and take with thee of the elders of Israel," 
signifies from primary truths; "and thy rod wherewith thou smotest the river," signifies the Divine power by which falsities had been dissipated; "take in thine hand, and go," signifies that equipped 
therewith he should perform the mandate; "Behold, I stand before thee there upon the rock in Horeb," signifies the Lord as to the truths of faith; "and thou shalt smite the rock," signifies that 
they should be urgent in entreating Him; "and there shall come waters out of it," signifies that the truths of faith are from Him; "that the people may drink," signifies which shall refresh them and 
give them spiritual life; "and Moses did so before the eyes of the elders of Israel," signifies the effect by means of primary truths. </p>

Verses 4-6 And Moses cried out to Jehovah, saying, What shall I do for this people? Yet a little and they stone me.<A name="fntext1"></a><A href="#fn1"><sup>a</sup></a> And Jehovah said to Moses, Pass on before the people, and take with you some of the 
elders of Israel; and your rod with which you struck the river, take in your hand, and go. Behold, I [will be] standing before you there on the rock in Horeb, and you are to strike the rock, and water 
will come out of it; and let the people drink. And Moses did so before the eyes of the elders of Israel. </p>
<p>'And Moses cried out to Jehovah, saying' means deep grief, and intercession 'What shall I 
do for this people?' means what should be done for those who make such bitter complaint because they are not in receipt of truth? 'Yet a little and they stone me' means that they are not far from doing 
violence to the truth from God. 'And Jehovah said to Moses' means aid. 'Pass on before the people' means that he is to lead and teach them. 'And take with you some of the elders of Israel' means with 
the help of leading truths. 'And your rod with which you struck the river' means the Divine power by means of which falsities were dispelled. 'Take in your hand, and go' means that furnished with that 
power, he is to carry out what has been commanded. 'Behold, I [will be] standing before you there on the rock in Horeb' means the Lord in respect of the truths of faith. 'And you are to strike the 
rock' means that they are to ask Him insistently. 'And water will come out of it' means that truths of faith will flow from Him. 'And let the people drink' means that those truths will refresh them and 
impart spiritual life. 'And Moses did so before the eyes of the elders of Israel' means the accomplishment by means of leading truths

Vers. 4-6.  Et clamavit Moscheh ad Jehovam, dicendo, Quid faciam populo huic? adhuc parum et lapidant me.  Et dixit Jehovah ad Moschen, Transi ante populum, et accipe cum te de senioribus Israelis, 
et baculum tuum, quo percussisti fluvium, accipe in manu tua, et vadas.  Ecce Ego stans ante te ibi super petra in Choreb, et percutias petram, et exibunt ex illa aquae, et (x)bibat populus; et fecit 
ita Moscheh ad oculos seniorum Israelis.  `Et clamavit Moscheh ad Jehovam, dicendo' significat lamentationem interiorem ac intercessionem: `Quid faciam populo huic?' significat pro illis qui in querimonia 
tam gravi ob non receptionem veri: `adhuc parum et lapidant me' significat quod non procul sit quin vero a Divino violentiam inferant: `et dixit Jehovah ad Moschen' significat opem: `Transi ante 
populum' significat ut ducat et doceat illos: `et accipe cum te de senioribus Israelis' significat ex primariis veris: `et baculum tuum, quo percussisti fluvium' significat potentiam Divinam, per quam 
dissipata sunt falsa: `accipe in manu tua, et vadas' significat quod illa instructus mandatum perficiat: `ecce Ego stans ante te ibi super petra in Choreb' significat Dominum quoad fidei vera: `et percutias 
petram' significat ut instent rogare ipsum: `et exibunt ex illa aquae' significat quod ab Ipso vera fidei: `et bibat populus' significat quae recreabunt illos, et vitam spiritualem dabunt: `et 
fecit ita Moscheh ad oculos seniorum Israelis' significat effectum per primaria vera. </p>
