<h3 align="center" class="ired">属天的奥秘 第4190节</h3>
<h4 align="center"></h4><p><strong>4190.</strong>“雅各就拿一块石头立作柱子”表类似真理和基于此的敬拜。这从“石头”和“柱子”的含义清楚可知：“石头”是指真理（参看<a href="643.htm">643</a>，<a href="1298.htm">1298</a>，<a href="3720.htm">3720</a>节）；“柱子”是指基于此，即基于真理的敬拜（<a href="3727.htm">3727</a>节）。由此明显可知，这句话表示类似真理和基于此的敬拜。之所以用“类似真理”这个词，就是诸如存在于外邦人当中的那种真理，是因为尽管外邦人不知道圣言，因而不认识主，但他们仍拥有诸如基督徒所拥有的那类外在真理，如：要以神圣的方式敬拜神，举行宗教节日，要孝敬父母，不可偷盗，不可奸淫，不可杀人，不可贪恋邻人的财物。因此，外邦人拥有包含在十诫里面，并且也是设在教会内的行为标准的那类真理。他们当中的智者不仅在外在形式上，而且还在内在形式上遵守这些律法。因为他们认为这种事不仅违背他们的宗教信仰，还违背公共利益，因而违背他们对别人的内在责任，因此这类行为违背仁爱，尽管他们并不怎么知道何为信仰。他们在自己的模糊中拥有一种良知，他们不愿违背这良知行事；事实上，其中一些人无法这样做。由此明显可知，主掌管他们的内层，尽管它们处于模糊的状态；并在如此行时赋予他们接受内层真理的能力，他们也的确在来世接受内层真理（参看前面关于外邦人的说明，<a href="2589.htm">2589</a>-<a href="2604.htm">2604</a>节）。<br />我有时得以与来世的基督徒谈论教会之外的外邦人的状态和命运，因为他们对信之真理与良善的接受，要比没有照主的诫命生活的基督徒容易得多；基督徒对他们的想法很残忍。也就是说，教会之外的所有人都是受诅咒的，这种思维方式建立在这一公认的准则之上：在主之外没有救恩。我曾告诉与我交谈的基督徒，这条准则是对的；不过，彼此过着仁爱生活，并出于某种良知行公义与公义的外邦人，在来世接受信仰、承认主，要比教会内那些没有过着仁爱生活的人更容易。此外，基督徒陷入虚假，以为天堂唯独是他们的，因为他们有圣言这本写在纸上，却没有写在他们心上的书；还因为他们认识主，然而却不相信祂在其人身方面也是神性；反而承认在他们称之为人性的其第二本质方面，祂仅仅是如同一个普通人。因此，当由着他们自己和他们自己的想法时，他们甚至不崇拜祂。因此，是他们在主之外，没有救恩。</p>

And Jacob took a stone, and set it up for a pillar. That this signifies such truth and the derivative worship, is evident from the signification of a "stone," as being truth (see n. 643, 1298, 3720); 
and from the signification of a "pillar," as being the derivative worship, that is, the worship which is from truth (n. 3727). From this it is manifest that such truth and the derivative worship are 
signified by these words. It is said "such truth," namely, such as exists with the Gentiles; for although the Gentiles know nothing about the Word, and accordingly nothing about the Lord, they nevertheless 
have external truths such as Christians have; as for instance that the Deity is to be worshiped in a holy manner, that festivals are to be observed, that parents are to be honored, that we must 
not steal, must not commit adultery, must not kill, and must not covet the neighbor's goods; and thus such truths as those of the Decalogue; which also are for rules of life within the church. The wise 
among them observe these laws not only in the external form, but also in the internal. For they think that such things are contrary not only to their religious system, but also to the general good, 
and thus to the internal duty which they owe to man, and that consequently they are contrary to charity, although they do not so well know what faith is. They have in their obscurity somewhat of conscience, 
contrary to which they are not willing to act, and in fact some of them cannot do so. From this it is evident that the Lord rules their interiors, although they are in obscurity; and thus that 
He imparts to them the faculty of receiving interior truths, which they do also receive in the other life. (See what has been shown above respecting the Gentiles, n. 2589-2604.)  [2] It has at times 
been given me to speak with Christians in the other life concerning the state and lot of the Gentiles outside of the church, in that they receive the truths and goods of faith more easily than do Christians 
who have not lived according to the precepts of the Lord; and that Christians think cruelly about them, in assuming that all who are out of the church are damned, and this from the received canon 
that without the Lord there is no salvation. This indeed, as I have said to them, is true; but the Gentiles who have lived in mutual charity, and have done from a kind of conscience what is just and 
equitable, receive faith and acknowledge the Lord more easily in the other life than those within the church who have not lived in such charity. Moreover Christians are in what is false, in believing 
that heaven is for them alone, because they have the book of the Word, written on paper but not in their hearts; and because they know the Lord, and yet do not believe that He is Divine as to His Human; 
but acknowledge Him only as a common man in respect to His other essence, which they call His human nature, and therefore when left to themselves and their own thoughts, they do not even adore Him. 
Thus it is they who are out of the Lord, for whom there is no salvation. </p>

'And Jacob took a stone and erected it as a pillar' means a like truth and worship based on this. This is clear from the meaning of 'a stone' as truth, dealt with in <a href="643.htm">643</a>, <a href="1298.htm">1298</a>, <a href="3720.htm">3720</a>, and from the meaning 
of 'a pillar' as worship based on it, that is, on truth, dealt with in <a href="3727.htm">3727</a>, from which paragraphs it is evident that these words mean a like truth and worship based on this. The expression 'a like 
truth' is used, that is, truth as it exists among gentiles, because although gentiles do not know anything about the Word or as a consequence about the Lord, they still have the same external truths 
as Christians, such as these: One should worship God with due reverence, keep religious festivals, and honour one's parents; one should not steal, commit adultery, or kill; also, one should not covet 
what belongs to another. Thus gentiles have the same kind of truths as are included in the Ten Commandments and are also the standards of behaviour set within the Church. The wise among them act in 
conformity not only with the external but also with the internal form which those same commandments take, for they think that the kinds of things which are forbidden are not only contrary to their religion 
but also contrary to the common good and so to the internal obligation which they owe to other people, and that as a consequence such actions are contrary to charity. And they think in this way 
even though they have little knowledge of what faith is. In their obscurity they possess a kind of conscience against which they are unwilling to act, indeed against which some are incapable of acting. 
From this it becomes clear that the Lord governs their interiors which are in obscurity, and in so doing imparts to them an ability to receive interior truths, which they also do receive in the next 
life - see what has been shown concerning gentiles in <a href="2589.htm">2589</a>-<a href="2604.htm">2604</a>. </p>
<p></p>
<p><b>[2]</b>
 I have been allowed to talk on several occasions to Christians in the next life about the state and fortune of gentiles outside 
the Church - that they accept the truths and goods of faith more easily than do Christians who have not lived according to the Lord's commandments, and that Christians think of gentiles in a heartless 
fashion. That is to say, they think that all outside the Church stand condemned, a way of thinking based on the established rule that outside the Lord there is no salvation. I have told the Christians 
to whom I have been speaking that this rule is true, but that gentiles who have led charitable lives with one another and who, moved by some kind of conscience, have done what is just and fair, receive 
faith and acknowledge the Lord more easily in the next life than those who are inside the Church and have not led charitable lives. I have gone on to say that Christians are subject to falsity when 
they believe that heaven is theirs alone because they have the Book of the Word, written down on paper but not in their hearts, and also when they know the Lord but do not believe that He is Divine 
as to His Human, indeed when they do not acknowledge Him, as to His second Essence which they term the human nature, as any more than an ordinary human being. Therefore, left to themselves and their 
own ideas they do not even adore Him. So it is they themselves who are outside the Lord, and for whom there is no salvation. </p>

`Et accepit Jacob lapidem, et erexit illum in statuam' quod significet verum tale et inde cultum, constat ex significatione `lapidis' quod sit verum, de qua n. 643, 1298, 3720; et ex significatione 
`statuae' quod sit cultus inde seu ex vero, de qua n. 3727; inde patet quod per illa verba significetur verum tale et inde cultus; verum tale dicitur quale nempe apud gentes; gentes enim tametsi 
non sciunt de Verbo, proinde de Domino, usque habent externa vera, qualia Christiani; sicut quod sancte colendum Numen, quod festa observanda: quod honorandi parentes, quod non furandum, quod non 
adulterandum, quod non occidendum, et quoque quod non concupiscenda alterius, ita qualia vera sunt decalogi {1}, quae etiam pro normis sunt intra Ecclesiam: qui inter illos sapiunt, eadem non modo 
observant in externa forma: sed etiam in interna, cogitant enim quod talia non solum sint contra (o)religiosum illorum, sed etiam contra bonum commune, ita {2} contra debitum internum quod homini, 
proinde {3} contra charitatem, tametsi non ita sciunt quid fides; in obscuro illis est quoddam conscientiae, contra quod facere non volunt, immo quidam non possunt; inde constare potest quod Dominus 
illorum interiora quae in obscuro sunt, regat, et sic quod facultatem illis impertiatur recipiendi vera interiora, quae etiam recipiunt in altera vita, videantur quae de gentibus n. 2589-2604 ostensa 
sunt.  [2] Aliquoties cum Christianis in altera vita loqui datum de statu et sorte gentium extra Ecclesiam, quod facilius illi {4} recipiant vera et bona fidei quam Christiani qui non secundum 
praecepta Domini vixerunt; </p>
<p>et quod Christiani crudeliter de illis cogitent, quod nempe omnes qui extra Ecclesiam sunt, damnati sint, et hoc ex recepto canone quod extra Dominum nulla salus; et quod 
hoc verum sit, sed quod gentes quae in charitate mutua vixerunt, ac justum et aequum ex quadam conscientia egerunt, facilius in altera vita recipiant fidem et agnoscant Dominum, quam qui intra Ecclesiam 
et non in tali charitate vixerunt; tum quod Christiani in falso sint, quod credant quod illis solis caelum quia Librum Verbi habent, scriptum in carta non autem in cordibus, et quod sciant 
Dominum, et Ipsum non Divinum credant quoad Humanum, immo nec agnoscant quam sicut communem hominem quoad alteram Ipsius Essentiam quam humanam naturam vocant; </p>
<p>ac ideo cum sibi et suis cogitationibus 
relicti sunt, ne quidem Ipsum adorant; et sic quod illi sint qui extra Dominum, quibus non salus.      @1 in decalogo$      @2 sed etiam$      @3 ita$      @4 ibi$ </p>
