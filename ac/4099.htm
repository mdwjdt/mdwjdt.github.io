<h3 align="center" class="ired">属天的奥秘 第4099节</h3>
<h4 align="center"></h4><p><strong>4099.</strong>“吞了我们的银钱”表若它们还不分离，它就要毁灭属于这些情感的真理。这从“吞”和“银”或“钱”的含义清楚可知：“吞”是指毁灭；“银”或“钱”是指真理（参看<a href="1551.htm">1551</a>，<a href="2954.htm">2954</a>节）。显然，“我们的银钱”表示属于这些情感的真理，因为如前面各处所示，“拉结”和“利亚”代表对真理的情感。没有人能知道这些话是什么意思，除非他了解有关良善与真理藉着居间良善植入的情况，也就是说，除非他知道作为居间良善的那些灵人社群是何性质。作为居间良善的灵人社群对尘世事物感兴趣，而用来引入对真理的情感的天使社群则对天堂事物，而非尘世事物感兴趣。<br />这两种社群与正在重生的人同在，并在他里面起作用。他在何等程度上通过天使被引入天堂事物，对尘世事物感兴趣的灵人就被移除到什么程度。若不移除它们，真理就会被驱散。因为当天堂事物掌管尘世事物时，尘世事物与天堂事物在人里面彼此和谐一致；但当尘世事物掌管天堂事物时，它们就不一致。当它们一致时，真理就在此人的属世层里面增多；当它们不一致时，它们的数量就会减少，甚至被毁，因为尘世事物会使天堂事物变暗，从而将它们置于怀疑中。当天堂事物掌权时，它们就会照亮尘世事物，将它们置于清晰的光明中，并消除疑虑。掌权的是那些被高于一切爱着的事物（也就是说，人爱之胜过一切的事物掌权）。由此可见“吞了我们的银钱”所表示的“若它们还不分离，它就要毁灭属于这些情感的真理”这句话是什么意思。</p>

And devouring hath also devoured our silver. That this signifies that it would consume the truth of those affections if they were not separated, is evident from the signification of "devouring," as being 
to consume; and from the signification of "silver," as being truth (see n. 1551, 2954). It is evident that "our silver" denotes the truth of those affections, for as often before shown, the affections 
of truth are represented by Rachel and Leah. What these things involve cannot be known, unless it is known how the case is with the goods and truths which are insinuated by means of a mediate good, 
or unless it is known of what nature are the societies of spirits which serve as mediate good. The societies of spirits which serve as mediate good are those which are in worldly things; but the societies 
of angels which serve for introducing the affections of truth are not in worldly but in heavenly things.  [2] These two kinds of societies are in action about a man who is being regenerated; 
and insofar as he is initiated by the angels into heavenly things, so far are the spirits who are in worldly things removed; and unless they are removed, truths are dissipated. For worldly things and 
heavenly things are in agreement in man when heavenly things rule over worldly ones; but they are in disagreement when worldly things rule over heavenly things. When they are in agreement, truths are 
multiplied in the man's natural; but when they are in disagreement truths are diminished, and even consumed, because worldly things darken heavenly things, and so consequently place them in doubt; but 
when heavenly things have rule, they throw light upon worldly things, and place them in clear light, and dispel doubts. Those things rule which are loved above all others. All this shows what is meant 
by the truth of affections being consumed if these were not separated; which is signified by "devouring he hath also devoured our silver." </p>

<p align="center"><b>Elliott(1983-1999) 4099</b></p><p><b>4099.</b>
'And also completely consumed our money' means it would destroy the truth belonging to those affections if they were not separated. This is clear from the meaning of 'consuming' as destroying, and from 
the meaning of 'money' or 'silver' as truth, dealt with in <a href="1551.htm">1551</a>, <a href="2954.htm">2954</a>. 'Our money' clearly means the truth belonging to those affections since 'Rachel' and 'Leah' represent affections for truth, as 
shown in various places already. No one can know what is implied in all this unless he knows about the implanting of goods and truths by means of intermediate good, that is, unless he knows the nature 
of those communities of spirits which serve as intermediate good. Communities of spirits which serve as intermediate good are interested in worldly things, whereas communities of angels which serve 
to introduce affections for truth are not interested in worldly things but in heavenly ones. </p>
<p></p>
<p><b>[2]</b>
 These two types of communities are present with and active in a person who is being regenerated. To 
the extent he is introduced into heavenly things through the angels, the spirits who are interested in worldly things are removed. And if they are not removed truths are dispersed, for worldly things 
and heavenly things accord with one another in a person when the heavenly have dominion over the worldly, but they do not accord when the worldly have dominion over the heavenly. When they accord, truths 
within man's natural are in that case multiplied, but when they do not accord, they decrease in number, indeed they are destroyed since worldly things darken heavenly ones, and so make them subject 
to doubt. But when heavenly things have dominion they shed light on worldly ones, set them in clear light and dispel doubts. Those things have dominion that are loved more than anything else. From this 
one may see what is meant by the statement about the destruction of the truth belonging to affections if they were not separated, meant by 'he has completely consumed our money'. </p>

`Et comedit etiam comedendo argentum nostrum': quod significet verum illarum affectionum quod consumeret si non separarentur, constat a significatione `comedere' quod sit consumere; et a significatione 
`argenti' quod sit verum, de qua n. 1551, 2954; argentum nostrum' quod sit verum illarum affectionum, patet, per `Rachelem' enim et `Leam' repraesentantur affectiones veri, ut prius passim ostensum. 
 Quid haec involvunt, nec sciri potest nisi sciatur quomodo se habet cum bonis et veris quae insinuantur per bonum medium, seu nisi sciatur quales sunt societates spirituum quae inserviunt 
pro bono medio; societates spirituum quae inserviunt pro bono medio, illae in mundanis sunt, at societates angelorum {1} quae inserviunt pro introducendis affectionibus veri, non in mundanis sed in 
caelestibus sunt; [2] hae binae societates agunt apud hominem qui regeneratur; quantum homo initiatur in caelestia per angelos, tantum removentur spiritus qui in mundanis sunt, et nisi removentur, 
dissipantur vera: mundana enim et caelestia concordant apud hominem quando caelestia dominantur super mundana; at discordant quando mundana dominantur super caelestia; quando concordant, tunc multiplicantur 
vera in naturali hominis; at quando discordant, tunc diminuuntur, immo consumuntur, quia mundana obfuscant caelestia, proinde ponunt illa in dubio; at caelestia cum dominium habent, illustrant 
mundana, prae altero amantur: ex his constare potest quid intelligitur per quod verum affectionum consumeret si non separarentur, quae significantur per `comedit comedendo argentum nostrum.
