<h4 align="center"></h4><p><strong>4106.</strong>“他所买的产业”表藉着这些从其它源头所获得的事物。这从“产业”和“买”的含义清楚可知：“产业”是指真理，如刚所才所述；“买”是指从其它源头所获得的事物。因为所买来的产业出自其它源头，然而它们是借助于拉班的羊群而获得的。</p>

<p align="center"><b>Potts(1905-1910) 4106</b></p><p><b>4106.</b>
The acquisition of his purchase. That this signifies the things procured by these from other sources, is evident from the signification of "acquisition," as being truths (concerning which above); and 
from the signification of "purchase," as being things procured from another source; for the acquisitions that were bought were from another source, but yet were from those that had been procured by means 
of the flock of Laban. </p>

<p align="center"><b>Elliott(1983-1999) 4106</b></p><p><b>4106.</b>
'The cattle he had purchased' means the things acquired by these from other sources. This is clear from the meaning of 'cattle' as truths, dealt with immediately above, and from the meaning of 'purchasing' 
as things acquired from other sources. For 'the cattle' which had been purchased came from another source, even though they had been gathered with the aid of Laban's flock. </p>

<p align="center"><b>Latin(1748-1756) 4106</b>
</p><b>4106.</b>
`Acquisitionem emptionis suae':  quod significet quae ab illis aliunde, constat ex significatione `acquisitionis' quod sint vera, de qua mox supra; et a significatione `emptionis' quod sint illa 
quae aliunde comparata; nam acquisitiones quae emptae sunt, erant aliunde, sed usque ex illis quae comparatae sunt per gregem {1} Labanis.      @1 greges$ </p>
