<h3 align="center" class="ired">属天的奥秘 第8455节</h3>
<h4 align="center"></h4><p><strong>8455.</strong>“营周围有一层露水”表依附于它自己的平安的真理。这从“露水”的含义清楚可知，“露水”是指平安的真理（<a href="3579.htm">3579</a>节）。“露水”之所以表示平安的真理，是因为它在早晨从天上降下，并像细雨一样落到草地上。它还含有一种甜味或愉悦感，比雨所含的更多，使得田野里的青草和庄稼欣欣向荣。“早晨”表示一种平安的状态（<a href="2780.htm">2780</a>节）。至于何为平安，可参看前文（<a href="2780.htm">2780</a>，<a href="3696.htm">3696</a>，<a href="4681.htm">4681</a>，<a href="5662.htm">5662</a>节），即：它就像地上的黎明，使人的心智充满快乐。平安的真理就像黎明之光。这个被称作平安真理的真理是存在于天堂并来自主的神性真理本身；它影响那里的所有人，无一例外，并使得天堂成为天堂。平安含有对主的信靠在自己里面，这种信靠就是相信祂主宰一切事物并供应一切事物，并且祂将人引向一个良善的目的。当一个人相信关于祂的这些事时，他就处于平安当中，因为这时，他什么都不怕，对要到来之事的忧虑也不会干扰他。人达到这种状态的程度取决于他对主的爱有多深。<br />一切邪恶，尤其对自我的信靠，都会夺走平安的状态。人们以为当某个坏人因诸事顺遂而平静欢乐时，他就在平安中。但这不是平安，它是属恶欲的平静和快乐，只是伪装成平安的状态。在来世，这种快乐因是属平安的快乐的对立面，故变成了不快乐；事实上，这种不快乐就隐藏在它里面。在来世，外层会一层一层地被卷走，甚至直到至内层。平安是一切快乐的核心，甚至是处于良善之人的不快乐的核心。因此，他脱去外在之物，平安的状态就越显现出来，他就越充满极乐、祝福和幸福，而极乐、祝福和幸福的源头就是主自己。<br />关于存在于天堂中的平安状态，可以说，它是无法用任何语言来描述的那种；并且只要他还在世上，它也无法通过源自世界的任何概念进入人的思维和觉知。那时它超越他的一切意识或感觉。心智的平静，诸事顺遂所带来的愉快相对来说什么也不是；因为这些只影响心智的外在部分。而平安影响所有人的至内在部分；它影响最初物质，以及人里面物质的开端，由此扩散并倾注到同这些物质和它们的开端。它将一种愉悦的感觉带入它们里面；给他的观念形成所在的部分，因而给他的生活目的带来极乐和幸福，从而将<br />他的心智变成一个天堂。</p>

<p align="center"><b>Potts(1905-1910) 8455</b></p><p><b>8455.</b>
There was a deposit of dew round about the camp. That this signifies the truth of peace adjoining itself, is evident from the signification of "dew," as being the truth of peace (n. 3579). "Dew" signifies 
the truth of peace because in the morning it comes down from heaven and appears upon the herbage like fine rain, and has also stored up in it something of sweetness or delight more than rain has, 
whereby the grass and the crops of the field are gladdened; and "morning" denotes a state of peace (n. 2780). What peace is see n. 2780, 3696, 4681, 5662, namely, that it is like dawn on the earth, 
which gladdens minds with universal delight; and the truth of peace is like the light of the dawn. This truth, which is called "the truth of peace," is the very Divine truth in heaven from the Lord, which 
universally affects all who are there, and makes heaven to be heaven; for peace has in it confidence in the Lord, that He directs all things, and provides all things, and that He leads to a good 
end. When a man is in this faith, he is in peace, for he then fears nothing, and no solicitude about things to come disquiets him. A man comes into this state in proportion as he comes into love to the 
Lord.  [2] All evil, especially self-confidence, takes away a state of peace. It is believed that an evil person is at peace when he is in gladness and tranquility because all things succeed with him. 
But this is not peace; it is the delight and tranquillity of cupidities, which counterfeit a state of peace. But in the other life this delight, being opposite to the delight of peace, is turned into 
what is undelightful, for this lies hidden within it. In the other life the exteriors are successively unfolded even to the inmosts, and peace is the inmost in all delight, even in what is undelightful 
with the man who is in good. So far therefore as he puts off what is external, so far a state of peace is revealed, and so far he is affected with satisfaction, blessedness, and happiness, the origin 
of which is from the Lord Himself.  [3] Concerning the state of peace which prevails in heaven it can be said that it is such as cannot be described by any words, neither, so long as he is in the 
world, can it come into the thought and perception of man, by means of any idea derived from the world. It is then above all sense. Tranquility of mind, content, and gladness from success, are relatively 
nothing; for these affect only his externals; whereas peace affects the inmost things of all-the first substances, and the beginnings of substances in the man, and therefrom distributes and pours 
itself forth into the substantiates and derivatives, and affects them with pleasantness; and affects the origins of ideas, consequently the man's ends of life, with satisfaction and happiness; and 
thus makes the mind of the man a heaven. </p>

'There was a deposit of dew around the camp' means the truth of peace attaching itself. This is clear from the meaning of 'dew' as the truth of peace, dealt with in <a href="3579.htm">3579</a>. The reason why 'dew' means the 
truth of peace is that it comes down in the morning from heaven or the sky and on grassland looks like a light shower of rain. But also it holds a certain sweetness or pleasantness, more so than a 
shower of rain does, and causes grass and crops in the field to rejoice. And 'morning' is a state of peace, <a href="2780.htm">2780</a>. For what peace is, see <a href="2780.htm">2780</a>, <a href="3696.htm">3696</a>, <a href="4681.htm">4681</a>, <a href="5662.htm">5662</a>, where it is said to be like the dawn on 
earth, which fills people's minds with overall delight. And the truth of peace is like the light of dawn. This truth which is being called the truth of peace is the Divine Truth itself present in heaven 
and coming from the Lord; it influences all there without exception, and causes heaven to be heaven. Peace holds within itself trust in the Lord, the trust that He governs all things and provides 
all things, and that He leads towards an end that is good. When a person believes these things about Him he is at peace, since he fears nothing and no anxiety about things to come disturbs him. How far 
a person attains this state depends on how far he attains love to the Lord. </p>
<p></p>
<p><b>[2]</b>
 Everything bad, especially trust in self, takes away the state of peace. People think that someone bad is at peace 
when he is calm and cheerful because everything is going right for him. But this is not peace, it is the calm and delight belonging to evil desires that merely simulates the state of peace. This delight, 
being the opposite of the delight belonging to peace, turns to undelight in the next life, for that is what lies hidden within it. In the next life outward things are rolled away one layer after another 
through to inmost things at the centre. Peace is at the centre of all delight, even of the undelight of a person governed by good. So far therefore as he casts off what is external the state of 
peace is revealed and he is filled with bliss, blessedness, and happiness, the source of which is the Lord Himself. </p>
<p></p>
<p><b>[3]</b>
 Regarding the state of peace that exists in heaven one may say it is such that 
no words can describe it; nor can any idea of a worldly origin enable it to enter a person's thought and perception, as long as he is in the world. It transcends all his awareness then. Calmness of 
mind, contentment, and cheerfulness because things are going right are nothing in comparison, for these affect only the outward parts of the mind. But peace affects the inmost parts of all; it affects 
the primary substances, and the beginnings of substances as they exist with a person, and from these it spreads and pours itself out into parts formed from those substances and beginnings of them. It 
brings a lovely feeling into them; it brings bliss and happiness to the parts where his ideas form, consequently to his ends in life, and so makes his mind into a heaven. </p>

`Fuit positio roris circum castra': quod significet verum pacis adjungens se, constat ex significatione `roris' quod sit verum pacis, de qua n. 3579; causa quod `ros' sit verum pacis, est quia mane 
descendit de caelo et apparet super (x)virecta sicut tenue imbris, et quoque prae imbre recondit aliquid dulcis {1}seu jucundi, unde gramen et seges agri laetantur, {2}et mane est status pacis, n. 2780; 
quid pax, videatur n. 2780, 3696, 4681, 5662, quod nempe se habeat sicut aurora in terra, quae animos universali jucundo laetificat; et verum pacis est sicut lux aurorae; hoc verum, quod vocatur verum 
pacis, est ipsum Divinum Verum in caelo a Domino, ac (t)afficit universaliter omnes qui ibi, et facit ut caelum sit caelum; pax enim {3}in se habet confidentiam in Dominum, quod Ipse regat omnia ac 
provideat omnia, et quod ad finem bonum ducat; cum homo in {4}fide horum est, tunc in pace est, nam tunc nihil timet, et nulla sollicitudo de futuris illum (x)inquietum reddit; in (x)hunc statum venit 
homo quantum in amorem 2 in Dominum; statum pacis aufert omne malum, imprimis confidentia sui; creditur quod {5} malus in pace sit, cum in laeto (c)et tranquillo {6}, ex eo quod omnia ei succedant; 
sed hoc non est pax, {7} est jucundum et tranquillum cupiditatum, quod mentitur {8}statum pacis, at {9}id jucundum, quia oppositum est jucundo pacis, vertitur in altera vita in {10} injucundum, tale 
enim latet intus in illo; {11} in altera vita exteriora successive evolvuntur usque ad intima, pax est intimum in omni jucundo, etiam in injucundo apud hominem qui in bono est; quantum itaque is exuit 
externum, tantum revelatur status pacis, et tantum afficitur fausto, beato, et felici, cujus origo est ab Ipso Domino. 	3 De statu pacis qui in caelo, dici potest quod sit talis ut {12}nullis 3 verbis 
describi queat, nec per ullam ideam ex mundo venire in cogitationem et perceptionem hominis, quamdiu est in mundo; est {13}super omnem sensum tunc; tranquillum animi, contentum, et laetum ex successibus, 
nihil {14} sunt respective, nam haec afficiunt modo externa, at pax afficit omnium intima, primas substantias, et substantiarum principia apud hominem, et inde se derivat et effundit in substantiata 
et principiata, ac ea afficit amoeno, (c)et idearum origines, proinde {15} fines vitae hominis fausto et felici; {16}et sic mentem hominis facit caelum. 	@1 ac jucundum$ 	@2 nam$ 	@3 secum$ 	@4
