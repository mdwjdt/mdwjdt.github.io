<h3 align="center" class="ired">属天的奥秘 第9790节</h3>
<h4 align="center"></h4><p><strong>9790.</strong>我也被允许看见出身社会低层的一些居民；他们的衣服就像欧洲农民的。我还看见一个男人和他的妻子在一起。女人有漂亮的身材，动作优美，男人也一样。不过，令我惊讶的是，男人走起路来很威严，步伐似乎很傲慢；而另一方面，那女人走起路却很谦恭。天使告诉我说，这是该星球的习俗；像这样的男人之所以被爱，是因为他们仍是善良的。他们继续告诉我说，他们不允许娶数个妻子，因为一夫多妻违反他们的法律。</p>

CONTINUATION ABOUT THE FIRST EARTH SEEN IN THE STARRY HEAVENS. It has also been granted me to see some of the in- habitants of a lower class. They were seen in a garment such as is worn by rustics in 
Europe. There was also seen a man with his wife. She appeared of handsome figure and becoming mien, as did likewise the man. But I was surprised at his grand style of walking, with steps as it were 
haughty, while on the other hand the woman walked with a lowly gait. The angels said that such is the custom on that earth, and that the men who are like this are loved, because they are nevertheless 
good. It was said further that they are not allowed to have more wives than one, because this is contrary to the laws. </p>

THE FIRST PLANET OUT IN SPACE WHICH I HAVE SEEN - continued  </p>
<p>I was also allowed to see several inhabitants who belonged to the lower ranks of society; their clothing was like that worn by peasants 
in Europe. I also saw a man and woman together. She had a beautifully upright figure and lovely movement of the body; and so did the man. But what astonished me was the fact that he walked majestically, 
with a seemingly proud step, whereas the woman in contrast to him walked with a humble step. Angels told me that this was the custom on that planet, and that men like the one I saw were loved because 
they were nevertheless good. They went on to tell me that the men were not permitted to have several wives, because polygamy was contrary to their laws.  </p>

Datum etiam est videre aliquot incolas qui ex viliore sorte erant; visi sunt in veste, in quali rustici in Europa; visus etiam est vir cum sua femina; haec apparebat pulchra statura et gestu decoro, 
vir similiter; sed quod miratus sum, ille ambulabat magnificus, gressu quasi fastuoso, sed mulier vicissim gressu humili; dicebatur ab angelis quod talis mos in illa tellure sit, et quod viri qui tales, 
amentur, quia usque boni sunt.  Dictum porro quod non liceat illis plures uxores habere, quoniam id contra leges. </p>
