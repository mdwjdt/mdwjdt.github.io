<h4 align="center"></h4><p><strong>822.</strong>有一种对邻人的仇恨以伤害和攻击每个人为乐。伤害越大，他们越高兴。很多来自社会最底层的人就是这样。和其秉性相似的人也有一些不属这一阶层的，他们由于所受的教养过着文明的生活，也由于害怕法律制裁，故表面上更体面一些。死后，这种人表现为上身赤裸，头发乱蓬蓬的。他们会猛扑过去，把手掌放在对方的肩膀上，以此互相惹恼，然后从他们头上跨过去，马上回来用拳头进行猛击。刚才提及的那些体面一点的人行为相似，只是他们会先互致问候，然后绕到邻人背后用拳头袭击。但是，他们面对面时又互相致敬，然后绕到对方背后用拳头打他。他们就这样保持表象。这些人出现在朝左的一段距离处，处在中间的一个高度。</p>

<p><strong>[NCE]822.</strong> There is a type of hatred toward others that prompts people to enjoy injuring and abusing everyone. The more damage they can inflict, the greater their pleasure. Many of them are from the lowest social strata. However, there are others not of that class who have the same visceral reactions but better superficial manners, having been brought up to live in polite society, and holding legal penalties in due regard.<br />After death they appear unclothed from the waist up, their hair unkempt. One will rush at another, grab the other's shoulders in a violent grip, tumble over the person's head, circle briefly, return, and slug away relentlessly.<br />Those whom I described as better behaved act similarly but first exchange courtesies, then go around behind the other's back to attack with their fists. When they see each other face to face, they greet each other and then circle behind again to strike their blows. In this way they preserve appearances.<br />These spirits are seen on the left at a middling height, some distance away. </p>

There is a kind of hatred against the neighbor, which finds its delight in injuring and harassing everyone; and the more mischief they can do the more delighted they are. There are very many such from 
the lowest of the common people. And there are those not of the common people who have a similar disposition, but outwardly are of better manners, from having been brought up in good society, and also 
from fear of legal penalties. After death, the upper part of the body of these spirits appears naked, and their hair disheveled. They annoy one another by rushing forward and placing the palms of their 
hands on each other's shoulders, and they then leap over their heads, and soon come back and make a severe attack with their fists. Those of whom it was said that they have better manners act in 
a similar way, but first exchange greetings, then go round behind their neighbor's back, and so attack with the fist; but when they see each other face to face they make a salutation, and again go round 
behind his back and strike him with the fist. In this way they keep up appearances. These appear at some distance toward the left side, at a middle height. </p>

There is a kind of hatred against the neighbour in which people take delight in hurting and attacking everybody. The more harm they can do to a person, the more pleasure it gives them. Very many belonging 
to the lowest class of society are such. There are also some not of that class who are like them in disposition (animus), but who are outwardly more respectable as a result of the civilized way 
of life in which they have been brought up, and on account of the fear of penalties set by the law. After death these people appear stripped to the waist, and with hair all unkempt. They go for one another 
by rushing forward and planting the palms of their hands on the other's shoulders and bounding over his head, only to come back after a quick about-turn and pummel him with their fists. Those referred 
to as being more respectable act in a similar way, but they first of all acknowledge each other before going round the back and so pummeling with their fist. But when they meet face to face they 
acknowledge each other and again go round the back and strike with the fist. In this way they keep up appearances. They are seen some distance away to the left at a middle height. </p>

</p><b>822.</b>
Est genus odii contra proximum, quod delectentur injurias facere et lacessere unumquemvis, et quo plus damni ei possint inferre, eo plus semet oblectant; sunt tales ex infima plebe permulti, sunt quoque 
qui non ex plebe qui illis similes animo, sed extus moratiores ex civili vita in quam educati et propter legis poenas; ii post mortem apparent quoad partem superiorem corporis nudi, circumsparsis 
comis; ruunt unus in alterum, volas tenentes in alterius scapulis, sic lacessunt, subsultant super caput alterius, redeunt post breves reversus et pugnis lacessunt graviter: qui moratiores fuerunt, de 
quibus dictum, faciunt similiter, sed salutant se prius, circumeunt ad tergum, et ita lacessunt pugno; sed cum vident eos facie, salutant, et iterum circumeunt ad tergum, et pugno percutiunt; ita apparentiam 
servant: apparent sinistrorsum in media altitudine, ad aliqualem distantiam. </p>
