<h3 align="center" class="ired">属天的奥秘 第3795节</h3>
<h4 align="center"></h4><p><strong>3795.</strong>“因为她是个牧羊女”（或她是一个放牧羊群的）表对包含在圣言中的内层真理的情感是那教导者。这从“牧人”或放牧羊群之人的含义和拉结的代表清楚可知：“牧人”或放牧羊群的人是指引领和教导的人（<a href="343.htm">343</a>节）；拉结，就是此处的“她”，是指对内层真理的情感，如刚才所述（<a href="3793.htm">3793</a>节）。之所以说内层真理出自圣言，是因为她领着羊群来自井旁；而“井”表示圣言（参看<a href="3765.htm">3765</a>节）。而且，正是对内层真理的情感在进行教导，因为教会凭这情感而成为教会，牧人或牧师凭这情感而成为牧师。在圣言中，“牧人”和放牧羊群的人之所以表示那些引领并教导的人，是因为“羊群”表示那些被引领和教导的人，因而表示教会，也表示教会所教导的教义（<a href="3767.htm">3767</a>，<a href="3768.htm">3768</a>，<a href="3783.htm">3783</a>节）。牧人或牧师和羊群具有这样的含义，这在基督教界是众所周知的，因为那些教导的人和那些学习的人就是如此被称呼的。故没有必要再通过圣言确认这些要点。</p>

For she was a shepherdess (or, "she was one who feeds.") That this signifies that the affection of interior truth teaches what is in the Word, is evident from the signification of a "shepherd," or one 
that feeds the flock, as being one who leads and teaches (n. 343); and from the representation of Rachel, who in the present case is "she," as being the affection of interior truth (concerning which 
just above, n. 3793). The reason this teaching is said to be from the Word is that she came to the well with the flock; and that the "well" signifies the Word may be seen above (n. 3765). Moreover it 
is the affection of interior truth which teaches; for from this affection the church is a church, and a shepherd or pastor is a pastor. The reason why in the Word a "shepherd," and "one that feeds" signifies 
those who lead and teach, is that a "flock" signifies those who are led and taught, consequently churches, and also doctrines of the church (n. 3767, 3768, 3783). That a "shepherd" and a "flock" 
have such a signification is well known in the Christian world, for so they who teach and they who learn are called, and therefore it is needless to confirm this from the Word. </p>

<p align="center"><b>Elliott(1983-1999) 3795</b></p><p><b>3795.</b>
'For she was a shepherdess' or one who feeds the flock means that the affection for interior truth contained in the Word is that which teaches. This is clear from the meaning of 'a shepherd' or one who 
feeds the flock<A name="fntext1"></a><A href="#fn1"><sup>a</sup></a> as one who leads and teaches, dealt with in <a href="343.htm">343</a>, and from the representation of Rachel, to whom 'she' refers here, as the affection for interior truth, dealt with just above in <a href="3793.htm">3793</a>. 
The reason why interior truth is said to come from the Word is that it was the well to which Rachel came with the flock - 'a well' meaning the Word, see <a href="3765.htm">3765</a>. What is more, it is the affection for 
interior truth that teaches, for it is by virtue of that affection that the Church is the Church and a shepherd or pastor is a pastor. The reason 'a shepherd' and one who feeds the flock means in the 
Word those who lead and teach is that 'the flock' means those who are led and taught, and therefore means Churches and also the doctrines which a Church teaches, <a href="3767.htm">3767</a>, <a href="3768.htm">3768</a>, <a href="3783.htm">3783</a>. The fact that shepherd 
or pastor and flock have these meanings is very well known in the Christian world, for these are the terms used for those who teach and those who learn. It is therefore superfluous to confirm these 
points from the Word.

<h4>Notes</h4><small>
<a name="fn1"></a><a href="#fntext1"><sup>a</sup></a> The Latin word pastor, translated shepherdess above, is used of anyone - male or female - who tends a flock or herd. But in the original Hebrew the word is taken to be feminine. </p>

`Quia pastor illa' seu pascens illa: quod significet quod affectio veri interioris quod in Verbo, doceat, constat ex significatione `pastoris seu pascentis' quod sit qui ducit et docet, de qua n. 
343; et ex repraesentatione `Rachelis,' quae hic est `illa,' quod sit affectio veri interioris, de qua mox supra, n. 3793; quod ex Verbo, est quia ad puteum cum grege ivit; `puteus' quod sit Verbum, 
videatur n. 3765; et praeterea affectio veri interioris est quae docet, ex illa (o)enim affectione Ecclesia est Ecclesia, et pastor est pastor.  Quod `pastor et pascens' in Verbo significet illos 
qui ducunt et docent, est quia `grex' significat illos qui ducuntur et docentur, proinde Ecclesias et quoque doctrinas quae sunt Ecclesiae, n. 3767, 3768, 3783; quod pastor et grex illa significent, 
in Christiano orbe notissimum est, ita enim vocantur illi qui docent et discunt {1}, quapropter illa ex Verbo confirmare supersedetur. @1 qui$ </p>
