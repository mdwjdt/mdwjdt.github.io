<h3 align="center" class="ired">属天的奥秘 第8734节</h3>
<h4 align="center"></h4><p><strong>8734.</strong>灵人的言语一般由照着丰满和情感而转化为话语的思维观念构成。由于对某个事物的整个观念以这种方式来呈现和传达，所以灵人在一分钟内所表达的，比一个人在世上一个小时内所表达的还要多；对某个事物的整体观念，就是存在于他们思维中的观念，被完全引入另一个人的思维。由此向我清楚显明，何为心智合一或属灵结合，也就是仁爱或相爱；也就是说，当一个人的心智以存在于它对另一个人的思维和意愿里的一切良善而呈现在对方的心智中，并由此激发他的情感时，这种合一就存在了；反之亦然。而另一方面也显明何为属灵分离，也就是敌意和仇恨，即：一个人的心智以毁灭另一个人的思维和意愿而呈现在对方的心智中，这导致弃绝。</p>

<p align="center"><b>Potts(1905-1910) 8734</b></p><p><b>8734.</b>
The speech of spirits in general is formed from ideas of thought that fall into words according to the fullness and the affection; and as the entire idea of the thing is thus presented and communicated, 
spirits can express more within a minute than a man in the world can within an hour; for the whole idea of the thing, such as it is in the thought, is fully transmitted into the thought of the other. 
From this it was made plain to me what the conjunction of minds or spiritual conjunction is (which is charity or mutual love), namely, that the mind of the one presents itself in the mind of the other 
with all the good of its own thought and will toward him, and in this way affects him; and on the other hand, what spiritual disjunction is (which is enmity and hatred), namely, that the mind of 
the one presents itself in the mind of the other with the thought and will of destroying him, which causes rejection. </p>

Spirits' speech generally is composed of ideas constituting thought which pass into words according to their fullness and the affection for them. And since the entire idea of something is in that way 
presented and conveyed, spirits can express more within a minute than a person in the world can within an hour; and every idea of something, as it exists in their thought, is introduced fully into another's 
thought. This has demonstrated to me what the unity of minds or spiritual togetherness is, known as charity or mutual love; that is to say, this unity exists when the mind of one person presents 
itself in the mind of another with all the good present in its thought and will towards that other, and thereby stirs his affection; and vice versa. And conversely it has demonstrated what spiritual 
division is, known as enmity and hatred, that it is the mind of one presenting itself in the mind of another with the thought and desire to destroy him, which leads to rejection. </p>

</p><b>8734.</b>
Loquela spirituum in genere formata est ex ideis quae sunt cogitationis, quae secundum plenitudinem et affectionem cadunt in voces; et quia integra idea rei sic sistitur et communicatur, spiritus plura 
possunt intra minutum exponere quam potest homo in mundo intra horam; nam omnis idea rei, qualis est in cogitatione, in alterius cogitationem plene immittitur.  Inde patuit mihi quid conjunctio animorum 
seu conjunctio spiritualis sit, quae est charitas seu amor mutuus, quod nempe unius mens se sistat in (t)alterius mente cum omni bono cogitationis et voluntatis suae erga illum, et sic afficiat; 
et vice versa, quid disjunctio spiritualis, quae est inimicitia et odium, quod nempe unius mens se sistat in mente alterius {1} cum cogitatione et voluntate destruendi illum, unde rejectio. 	@1 i sicur hostis$ </p>
