<h3 align="center" class="ired">属天的奥秘 第4738节</h3>
<h4 align="center"></h4><p><strong>4738.</strong>“流便要救他脱离他们的手，把他送回父亲那里”表它可为教会争取它。这从“救（他）脱离他们的手”和“送回父亲那里”的含义清楚可知：“救（他）脱离他们的手”是指解救，如前所述（<a href="4732.htm">4732</a>节）；“送回父亲那里”是指为教会争取它；因为雅各，就是此处的“父亲”，代表源于古教会的犹太教，如前所述（<a href="4700.htm">4700</a>，<a href="4701.htm">4701</a>节）。为这个教会所争取的，正是关于主的神性人身的神性真理，因为如前所述，“约瑟”尤表这个真理。<br />为进一步了解这个真理，要知道，古教会承认它，初代基督教会也承认它。但后来，教皇的权柄如此增长，以至于能控制所有人的灵魂，并且高举自己，就像以赛亚书上所说巴比伦王所行的那样：“你心里曾说，我要升到天上！我要高举我的宝座在天上（或神）众星以上；我要坐在聚会的山上，我要升到高云之上，我要与至高者同等”（以赛亚书<a href="http://39-27.cn/赛14.13.htm">14:13</a>-<a href="http://39-27.cn/赛14.14.htm">14</a>），到了这种时候，神性就从主的人身那里被夺走，也就是说，祂的神性与祂的人身就有了区分，并且彼此分离。<br />这种区分如何在某次公会上被裁定，也向我揭示了。我看见一些灵人出现在我左前方脚底那个层面，离我有一段距离。他们正在一起交谈，但我没有听见谈的是什么。我被告知，他们就是那些参与针对主的两种性质，即神性与人性作出裁决的公会之人当中的某些人。很快我就被恩准与他们交谈。他们说，那些影响力最大，地位和权力高于其他人的人都聚在一个黑屋子里，在那里达成以下协议：神性与人性都应归于主；他们作了这样的决定主要是因为，若不这样，教皇的统治就无法维持。因为如果他们承认主与父为一，如祂自己所说的，就没有人会被承认为主在地上的代表人。当时，教会正在分裂，如果他们不作出这种区分，这种分裂就会推翻并毁灭教皇的权柄。为了强化这种捏造，他们还从圣言搜集证据，并说服参加公会的其他人。<br />这些灵人补充说，利用这种手段，他们就能在天上和地上掌权。他们从圣言知道，天上地上的一切权柄都被赐给了主；如果主的人身也被承认为神性，这种权柄就无法被归给任何代理人了。因为他们知道，人不可将自己等同于神；这种权柄本质上存在于神性，而非人身里面，除非神性被赋予这人身，正如神性后来被赐给彼得那样。他们继续说，当时教会的分裂者是一些具有敏锐洞察力的人；他们这样做就能平息这些人，还能巩固教皇的权柄。由此明显可知，他们捏造这种区分纯粹是为了掌控；因此，他们不想知道天上地上的权柄被赐给主的人身，因为这将证明，祂的人身也是神性。同样明显可知，被主赋予天堂钥匙的“彼得”不是指彼得这个人，而是指植根于仁爱的信仰；这种信仰唯独从主而得，因此是唯独属于主的一种权柄（参看创世记22章）。</p>

That he might rescue him out of their hand, to bring him back to his father. That this signifies that it might claim it for the church, is evident from the signification of "rescuing out of their hand," 
as being to set free-as above (n. 4732) and from the signification of "bringing back to his father" as being to claim for the church; for by Jacob, who is here the "father," is represented the Jewish 
religion derived from the Ancient Church, as above (n. 4700, 4701). It was the Divine truth concerning the Lord's Divine Human that it would claim for the church, for by Joseph, as before said, this 
truth is specifically signified.  [2] As further regards this truth, be it known that the Ancient Church acknowledged it, and also the primitive Christian Church; but after the papal sway had grown 
even to domination over all human souls, and had exalted itself-as is said of the King of Babylon in Isaiah, "Thou saidst in thy heart, I will ascend into the heavens, I will exalt my throne above the 
stars of heaven, and I will sit in the mount of congregation, I will ascend above the heights of the cloud, I will become like the Most High" (Isa. 14:13-14)-then the Divine was taken away from the 
Lord's Human, that is, a distinction was then made between His Divine and His Human.  [3] How this was decreed in a certain council has also been revealed to me. There appeared to me certain spirits 
in front to the left on the plane of the sole of the foot, at some distance from me, who were talking together, but about what I did not hear. I was then told that they were some of those who composed 
the council in which the decree was made regarding the Lord's two natures, the Divine and the human. Presently it was granted me to converse with them. They said that those who had the greatest influence 
in the council, and who were superior to the rest in rank and authority, came together in a dark room and there concluded that both a Divine and a human nature should be attributed to the Lord; 
chiefly for the reason that otherwise the papal sway could not be maintained. For if they had acknowledged the Lord to be one with the Father, as He Himself says, no one could have been acknowledged as 
His vicar on earth; for schisms were arising at that time by which the papal power might have fallen and been dissipated unless they had made this distinction; and for the strengthening of this invention 
they sought out confirmations from the Word, and persuaded the rest.  [4] The spirits added that by this means they were able to rule in heaven and on earth, because they had it from the Word that 
to the Lord was given all power in heaven and on earth, which power could not have been attributed to any vicar if His Human also were acknowledged to be Divine; for they knew that no one was allowed 
to make himself equal to God, and that the Divine had this power of Itself, but not the Human, unless it had been given it, as it was afterwards to Peter. They continued, that the schismatics of that 
day were men of acute discernment, whom in this way they were able to quiet, and by this means the papal power was also confirmed. From all this it is evident that this distinction was invented merely 
for the sake of dominion; and that for this reason they were not willing to know that the power given to the Lord's Human in heaven and on earth shows that it also is Divine. That Peter, to whom 
the Lord gave the keys of heaven, does not mean Peter, but the faith of charity, which, because it is from the Lord alone, is the power of the Lord alone, can be seen in the preface to the twenty-second 
chapter of Genesis. </p>

<p align="center"><b>Elliott(1983-1999) 4738</b></p><p><b>4738.</b>
'So that he might therefore rescue him out of their hands, to return him to his father' means so that it might lay claim to it for the Church. This is clear from the meaning of 'rescuing out of their 
hands' as delivering, as above in <a href="4732.htm">4732</a>, and from the meaning of 'returning to his father' as laying claim to it for the Church; for Jacob, to whom 'father' refers here, represents the Jewish religion 
which sprang from the Ancient Church, as above in <a href="4700.htm">4700</a>, <a href="4701.htm">4701</a>. What was laid claim to for the Church was the Divine Truth concerning the Lord's Divine Human, for, as stated already, 'Joseph' means that 
truth specifically. </p>
<p></p>
<p><b>[2]</b>
 To know more regarding this truth, it should be recognized that the Ancient Church acknowledged it, as also did the Primitive Christian Church. But there came a time when 
the papacy so extended its authority that it had control over every human soul; it exalted itself in the way the king of Babel is said to have done, in Isaiah, </p>
<blockquote>
You said in your heart. I will go up 
into the heavens, above the stars of God<A name="fntext1"></a><A href="#fn1"><sup>a</sup></a> I will raise my throne, and I will sit on the mount of assembly, I will go up above the heights of the clouds, and I will make myself like the Most High. <a href="http://bible.gospelcom.net/cgi-bin/bible?passage=Isa%2014:13,%2014&amp;version=ESV&amp;interface=print&amp;showfn=yes&amp;showxref">Isa 14:13, 14</a>. 
</blockquote>
<p>Then - at that time - Divinity was taken away from the Lord's Human, that is, His Divine was made distinct and separate from His Human. </p>
<p></p>
<p><b>[3]</b>
 The way in which this distinction was decreed 
in a certain council<A name="fntext2"></a><A href="#fn2"><sup>b</sup></a> has also been revealed to me. I saw some people appear on the right in front of me, some distance away on a level with the sole of my foot. They were talking among themselves, 
but I did not hear what about. I was told that they were some of those who had come together in the council when the decree was made regarding the Lord's two Natures - His Divine one and His Human 
one. Shortly after that I was allowed to talk to them They said that those who had the greatest influence in the council and who held higher positions and had higher authority than the rest met together. 
They did so in a room that was dark, where they decided that both Divinity and Humanity should be attributed to the Lord, the main reason for their decision being that otherwise the papacy could not 
have remained in being. For if they had acknowledged that the Lord was one with the Father, as He Himself says, no one could then have been acknowledged as His vicar on earth. Schisms were developing 
at that time, which would have toppled and destroyed the power of the papacy, had they not made that distinction. To strengthen it they also assembled proof texts from the Word and swayed the rest 
of the council. </p>
<p></p>
<p><b>[4]</b>
 Those who spoke to me added that by doing this they were able to have control in heaven and on earth. They knew from the Word that all power in heaven and on earth had been given 
to the Lord, and this power could not have been granted to any vicar [of Christ] if the Human too were acknowledged to be Divine. For they knew that no one was allowed to make himself equal to God and 
that that power existed essentially in the Divine, not in the Human unless it was granted to it as it was also subsequently granted to Peter. They said that by doing what they did they were then able 
to keep the schismatics quiet who were most astute, and were also able to strengthen the power of the papacy. From this it is clear that they invented the distinction they made purely for the sake 
of having control, and that therefore they had no wish to know that the gift of power to the Lord's Human in heaven and on earth demonstrates that His Human too is Divine. It is also clear that 'Peter', 
to whom the Lord gave the keys of heaven, does not mean the man Peter but faith rooted in charity, which is received from the Lord alone and is therefore a power that belongs to the Lord alone - see 
Preface to Gen. <a href="22.htm">22</a>.

`Propterea ut eriperet eum e manu illorum, ad reducendum eum ad patrem ejus': quod significet ut vindicaret Ecclesiae, constat ex significatione `eripere e manu illorum' quod sit liberare, ut supra 
n. 4732; et a significatione `reducere ad patrem ejus {1}' quod sit vindicare Ecclesiae; per `Jacobum' enim qui hic est `pater,' repraesentatur religio judaica ex Antiqua Ecclesia, ut supra n. 4700, 
4701.  Quod vindicaret Ecclesiae, est Divinum Verum de Divino Humano Domini {2}, nam per `Josephum' id {3} verum in specie significatur, (o)ut prius dictum.  [2] Quod ulterius hoc verum attinet, 
sciendum quod Antiqua Ecclesia id agnoverit, et quoque Primitiva Ecclesia Christiana; sed postquam papale solium succrevit usque ad dominatum super omnes animas humanas, et evexit se sicut de rege 
Babelis dicitur apud Esaiam,           Tu dixisti in corde tuo, In caelos ascendam, super      stellas caeli exaltabo thronum meum, et sedebo in monte      conventus; ascendam super excelsa nubis, 
et similis fiam      Altissimo, xiv 13, 14; </p>
<p>tunc Divinum derogabatur Humano Domini, seu tunc distinguebatur inter Ipsius Divinum et Humanum; [3] quomodo hoc decretum sit in quodam concilio, etiam 
mihi revelatum est.  Apparuerunt mihi quidam antrorsum ad sinistrum ad manum plantae pedis ad aliquam a me distantiam, qui inter se loquebantur, sed non audivi de qua re; </p>
<p>dicebatur mihi quod essent 
aliqui ex illis qui una fuerunt in concilio quando decretum de bina Natura Domini, Divina et Humana; </p>
<p>mox etiam cum illis loqui dabatur; dicebant quod illi qui in concilio maximum influxum habuerunt 
et reliquis dignitate et auctoritate praevaluerunt, convenerint, et tunc in camera obscura, et concluserint quod Domino tribueretur et Divinum et Humanum, principaliter ex causa quod alioquin 
papale solium non subsisteret; </p>
<p>si enim agnovissent Dominum pro uno cum Patre, sicut Ipse dicit, non potuisset aliquis vicarius ejus agnosci in terra; schismata enim eo tempore existebant per quae potuisset 
papalis potestas labi ac dissipari, nisi ita distinxissent; et quod ad illud corroborandum conquisiverint confirmantia ex Verbo, et persuaserint reliquis; [4] addiderunt quod sic dominari 
potuerint in caelo et in terra, quia ex Verbo habuerunt quod Domino data esset omnis potestas in caelis et in terris, quae alicui vicario non tribu potuisset si Humanum etiam Divinum agnosceretur; 
sciebant enim quod nemo (t)se aequalem Deo liceret facere et quod Divinum illam potestatem ex se haberet, non autem Humanum nisi illa ei data fuisset sicut etiam postea Petro: dicebant quod schismatici 
tunc perspicaci ingenio essent, quos sedare ita potuerunt; et quod sic etiam papalis potestas confirmata sit.  Exinde constat quod solum dominationis causa hoc inventum sit; et quod propterea 
non scire voluerint quod potestas data Humano Domini in caelis et in terris, manifestet quod illud quoque Divinum esset; et quod `Petrus' cui a Domino dati claves caelorum, non sit Petrus qui intelligitur, 
sed fides charitatis, quae quia est a solo Domino, est potestas Solius Domini, videatur Praefatio ad Gen. xxii.      @1 suum$      @2 i ut supra dictum$      @3 hoc$ </p>
