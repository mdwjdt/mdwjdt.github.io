<h3 align="center" class="ired">属天的奥秘 第8330节</h3>
<h4 align="center"></h4><p><strong>8330.</strong>“主啊，就是你手所预备的圣所”表那些处于来自主的信之真理的人所在的天堂。这从“圣所”和“你手所预备”的含义清楚可知：“圣所”是指信之真理所在的天堂，如下文所述；“你手所预备”是指从主来的。经上论及“圣所”，之所以说“你手所预备的”，是因为“手”论及真理，表示能力。“手”论及真理（参看<a href="3091.htm">3091</a>，<a href="8281.htm">8281</a>节）；“手”也表示能力（<a href="878.htm">878</a>，<a href="3387.htm">3387</a>，<a href="4931.htm">4931</a>-<a href="4937.htm">4937</a>，<a href="5327.htm">5327</a>，<a href="5328.htm">5328</a>，<a href="6292.htm">6292</a>，<a href="6947.htm">6947</a>，<a href="7011.htm">7011</a>，<a href="7188.htm">7188</a>，<a href="7189.htm">7189</a>，<a href="7518.htm">7518</a>，<a href="7673.htm">7673</a>，<a href="8050.htm">8050</a>，<a href="8069.htm">8069</a>，<a href="8153.htm">8153</a>，<a href="8281.htm">8281</a>节）；“圣所”以同样的方式论及真理（<a href="8302.htm">8302</a>节）。但在此之前的话，即“为你居住的地方”和“耶和华啊，就是你所造来”则论及良善，因为它们涉及“产业的山”，“产业的山”表示仁之良善所在的天堂（<a href="8327.htm">8327</a>节）。圣言中有些话论及良善，有些话论及真理（参看<a href="8314.htm">8314</a>节）。<br />必须简要阐明何谓“产业的山”所表示的仁之良善所在的天堂，何谓“圣所”所表示的信之真理所在的天堂。仁之良善所在的天堂是主的属灵国度的内在成员所住的天堂，而信之真理所在的天堂是该国度的外在成员所住的天堂。内在成员是指那些处于仁本身和植根于仁的信之人，而外在成员是指那些处于信，尚未处于仁的人。后者出于顺从行善，而前者出于情感行善。这几个细节表明何谓仁之良善所在的天堂，何谓信之真理所在的天堂。<br />至于“圣所”，它在至高意义上表示来自主的信之真理，由此在代表意义上表示主的属灵国度，以及属灵教会，并由此表示作为一个教会的一个重生之人，进而在从这些抽象出来的意义上表示信之真理，因而表示信本身。至于“神圣”表示什么，可参看前文（<a href="8302.htm">8302</a>节）。<br />正因如此，使得天堂被称为“圣所”的，是来自主的信之真理，如在诗篇：<br />愿耶和华在你遭难的日子应答你。愿祂从圣所给你救助，从锡安扶持你。（诗篇<a href="http://39-27.cn/诗20.1.htm">20:1</a>，<a href="http://39-27.cn/诗20.2.htm">2</a>）<br />此处“圣所”表示信之真理所在的天堂；“锡安”表示爱之良善所在的天堂。<br /><br />神啊，他们在圣所已经看见你行走，我的神、我的王行走。神啊，你从圣所显为可畏，以色列的神。（诗篇<a href="http://39-27.cn/诗68.24.htm">68:24</a>，<a href="http://39-27.cn/诗68.35.htm">35</a>）<br />“圣所”表示信之真理所在的天堂。这就是为何经上用“神”，而非“耶和华”之名，还提到“王”；因为“神”用在论述真理的地方，“耶和华”用在论述良善的地方（<a href="2586.htm">2586</a>，<a href="2769.htm">2769</a>，<a href="2807.htm">2807</a>，<a href="2822.htm">2822</a>，<a href="3921.htm">3921</a>e，<a href="4402.htm">4402</a>，<a href="7010.htm">7010</a>，<a href="7268.htm">7268</a>节），“王”表示真理（<a href="1672.htm">1672</a>，<a href="1728.htm">1728</a>，<a href="2015.htm">2015</a>，<a href="2069.htm">2069</a>，<a href="3009.htm">3009</a>，<a href="4575.htm">4575</a>，<a href="4581.htm">4581</a>，<a href="4966.htm">4966</a>，<a href="5044.htm">5044</a>，<a href="5068.htm">5068</a>，<a href="6148.htm">6148</a>节）。<br /><br />人民要赞美耶，因为祂从至高的圣所垂看。耶和华从天向地观看，要垂听被囚之人的叹息，要释放将要死的人。（诗篇<a href="http://39-27.cn/诗102.18.htm">102:18</a>-<a href="http://39-27.cn/诗102.20.htm">20</a>）<br />此处“圣所”也表示信之真理方面的天堂。<br />你们要在神的圣所赞美神，在祂能力的穹苍下赞美祂！（诗篇<a href="http://39-27.cn/诗150.1.htm">150:1</a>）<br />“在圣所赞美”表示出于来自主的信之真理赞美，“在能力的穹苍下赞美”表示出于来自主的仁之良善（赞美）。</p>

<p align="center"><b>Potts(1905-1910) 8330</b></p><p><b>8330.</b>
The sanctuary, O Lord, which thy hands have prepared. That this signifies heaven where are they who are in the truth of faith from the Lord, is evident from the signification of "the sanctuary," as being 
heaven where is the truth of faith (of which below); and from the signification of "Thy hands have prepared," as being that which is from the Lord. It is said of the sanctuary that "Thy hands have 
prepared it," because the "hands" are predicated of truth, and signify power. (That the "hands" are predicated of truth, see n. 3091, 8281; and also that they denote power, n. 878, 3387, 4931-4937, 
5327, 5328, 6292, 6947, 7011, 7188, 7189, 7518, 7673, 8050, 8069, 8153, 8281; in like manner that "sanctuary" is predicated of truth, n. 8302.) But the words which precede, as "the place for Thee to dwell 
in," and "which Thou hast wrought O Jehovah," are predicated of good, because they relate to "the mountain of inheritance," by which is signified heaven wherein is the good of charity (n. 8327). 
(That there are words which in the Word are predicated of good, and words which are predicated of truth, see n. 8314.) [2] What is meant by the heaven in which is the good of charity, which is signified 
by "the mountain of inheritance," and what by the heaven in which is the truth of faith, which is "the sanctuary," shall be briefly told. The heaven in which is the good of charity is that in which 
are the interior ones who belong to the Lord's spiritual kingdom; and the heaven in which is the truth of faith is that in which are the exterior ones who belong to this kingdom. They who are interior 
are in charity itself and in the derivative faith; but they who are exterior are those who are in faith, but not yet in charity. These latter do good from obedience, but the former from affection. 
From all this it is evident what is meant by the heaven in which is the good of charity, and what by the heaven in which is the truth of faith. [3] As regards the "sanctuary," it denotes in the supreme 
sense the truth of faith which is from the Lord, and consequently in the representative sense it denotes the Lord's spiritual kingdom, also the spiritual church, and from this a regenerated man who 
is a church, and thus in a sense abstracted from these it denotes the truth of faith, thus faith itself. (What "holy" denotes see above, n. 8302.) [4] From this then it is that heaven is called "the 
sanctuary" from the truth of faith which is from the Lord, as in David: </p>
<p>     Jehovah answer thee in the day of trouble, send thee help from the sanctuary, and sustain thee out of Zion (Ps. 20:1, 2); 
  here "the sanctuary" denotes the heaven where is the truth of faith; "Zion" denotes the heaven where is the good of love.      They have seen Thy goings, O God, the goings of my God, of my King, 
in the sanctuary; to be feared is God, out of Thy sanctuaries the God of Israel (Ps. 68:24, 35); </p>
<p>"the sanctuary" denotes the heaven where is the truth of faith, consequently it is said "God," and not 
"Jehovah," and also "King;" because "God" is said where truth is treated of, and "Jehovah" where good is treated of (n. 2586, 2769, 2807, 2822, 3921, 4402, 7010, 7268), and because "King" denotes truth 
(n. 1672, 1728, 2015, 2069, 3009, 4575, 4581, 4966, 5044, 5068, 6148). [5] In the same: </p>
<p>     A people shall praise Jah, because He hath looked forth from the height of His sanctuary; from the heavens 
did Jehovah look upon the earth, to hear the groaning of the bound one, to open to the sons of death (Ps. 102:18-20); </p>
<p>here also "sanctuary" denotes heaven as to the truth of faith. In the same: </p>
<p> 
    Praise ye God in His sanctuary; praise ye Him in the expanse of His strength (Ps. 150:1); </p>
<p>"to praise in the sanctuary" denotes to do so from the truth of faith which is from the Lord; and "to praise 
in the expanse of His strength," denotes by virtue of the good of charity which is from the Lord. </p>

<p align="center"><b>Elliott(1983-1999) 8330</b></p><p><b>8330.</b>
'The sanctuary, O Lord, [which] Your hands have prepared' means the heaven where those guided by the truth of faith coming from the Lord are. This is clear from the meaning of 'the sanctuary' as the 
heaven where the truth of faith resides, dealt with below; and from the meaning of 'Your hands have prepared' as that which comes from the Lord. The reason why the words 'hands have prepared' are used 
in connection with 'the sanctuary' is that 'hands' have reference to truth and mean power. For 'hands' and their reference to truth, see <a href="3091.htm">3091</a>, <a href="8281.htm">8281</a>; for their meaning as power, <a href="878.htm">878</a>, <a href="3387.htm">3387</a>, <a href="4931.htm">4931</a>-<a href="4937.htm">4937</a>, <a href="5327.htm">5327</a>, <a href="5328.htm">5328</a>, <a href="6292.htm">6292</a>, <a href="6947.htm">6947</a>, <a href="7011.htm">7011</a>, <a href="7188.htm">7188</a>, <a href="7189.htm">7189</a>, <a href="7518.htm">7518</a>, <a href="7673.htm">7673</a>, <a href="8050.htm">8050</a>, <a href="8069.htm">8069</a>, <a href="8153.htm">8153</a>, <a href="8281.htm">8281</a>; and for 'the sanctuary', that this in a similar way has reference to truth, <a href="8302.htm">8302</a>. But the words which come immediately before 
- 'a place for You to dwell in' and 'You have made, O Jehovah' - have reference to good because they apply to 'mountain of inheritance', which means the heaven in which the good of charity resides, 
<a href="8327.htm">8327</a>. There are expressions which when used in the Word have reference to good, and there are expressions which have reference to truth, see <a href="8314.htm">8314</a>. </p>
<p></p>
<p><b>[2]</b>
 What is implied by the heaven in which the good 
of charity resides, meant by 'mountain of inheritance', and what is implied by the heaven in which the truth of faith resides, meant by 'the sanctuary', must be stated briefly. The heaven in which 
the good of charity resides is that which is inhabited by the more internal members of the Lord's spiritual kingdom, and the heaven in which the truth of faith resides is that which is inhabited by the 
more external members of that kingdom. The internal members are those in whom charity itself resides and faith rooted in charity, whereas the external members are those in whom faith resides but not 
as yet charity. The latter are moved to do good by a sense of obedience, but the former by affection. These few details show what one should understand by the heaven in which the good of charity resides 
and the heaven in which the truth of faith resides. </p>
<p></p>
<p><b>[3]</b>
 As regards 'the sanctuary', in the highest sense it means the truth of faith which comes from the Lord. From this it means in the representative 
sense the Lord's spiritual kingdom, also the spiritual Church, and therefore a regenerated person who is an embodiment of the Church, and so means in the sense abstracted from these the truth 
of faith, thus faith itself. For what 'sanctified' or 'troy means, see above in <a href="8302.htm">8302</a>. So it is then that the truth of faith which comes from the Lord is what causes heaven to be called 'the sanctuary', 
as in David, </p>

May Jehovah answer you in the day of trouble. May He send you help from the sanctuary, and sustain you out of Zion. <a href="http://bible.gospelcom.net/cgi-bin/bible?passage=Ps%2020:1,%202&amp;version=ESV&amp;interface=print&amp;showfn=yes&amp;showxref">Ps 20:1, 2</a>.

<p>Here 'the sanctuary' stands for the heaven where 
the truth of faith resides, 'Zion' for the heaven where the good of love resides. </p>

<p>'The sanctuary' stands for the heaven where the truth of faith resides. This is why the name 'God', not 'Jehovah',

<p>'Praising in the sanctuary' stands for doing so from the truth of faith which comes from the Lord, 'praising in
