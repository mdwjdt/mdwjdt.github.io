<h4 align="center"></h4><p><strong>94.</strong>创世记2:7 耶和华神用土里的尘埃造人，将生气吹在他鼻孔里，他就成了有灵的活人。<br />“用土里的尘埃造人”指造人的外在，此前他还称不上人，因为经上说：“还没有人耕土。”“将生气吹在他鼻孔里”指赋予他信与爱的活力。“他就成了有灵的活人”表示其外在也得到了活力。</p>

And Jehovah God formed a human, dirt from the ground, and he breathed into the human's nostrils the breath of lives; and the human was made into a living soul.<br />To form a human, dirt from the ground is to form our outer self, which was not previously human; verse <a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_94/bible_king-james-version_genesis_2_5" target=_top>5</a>, after all, says that there was no person to cultivate the ground. To breathe into the human's nostrils the breath of lives is to put life into our faith and love. The human was made into a living soul means that our outer self has also been brought to life. </p>

Verse 7. And Jehovah God formed man, dust from the ground, and breathed into his nostrils the breath [spiraculum] of lives, and man became a living soul. To "form man, dust from the ground" is to form 
his external man, which before was not man; for it is said (verse 5) that there was "no man to till the ground." To "breathe into his nostrils the breath of lives" is to give him the life of faith and 
love; and by "man became a living soul" is signified that his external man also was made alive. </p>

Vers. 7.  Et formavit Jehovah Deus hominem, pulverem ex humo; et inspiravit in nares ejus spiraculum vitarum; et factus homo in animam viventem. 'Formare hominem, pulverem ex humo' est externum ejus 
hominem, qui non prius homo fuit; nam dictum vers. 5 quod nullus homo ad colendum humum. 'Inspirare in nares ejus spiraculum vitarum' est dare ei vitam fidei et amoris: 'factus homo in animam viventem' 
est quod externus homo quoque factus vivens.
