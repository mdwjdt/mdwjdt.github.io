<h3 align="center" class="ired">属天的奥秘 第3425节</h3>
<h4 align="center"></h4><p><strong>3425.</strong>“基拉耳的牧人与以撒的牧人争竞”表那些教导的人看不到其中任何此类事物，因为内义中的事物与字义中的事物看似相反。这从“争竞”、“牧人”和“基拉耳”的含义清楚可知：当论述的主题是圣言的内义时，“争竞”是指拒绝认识任何此类事物，因为他们声称没有看见它；“牧人”是指那些教导的人（<a href="343.htm">343</a>节）；“基拉耳”是指信（<a href="1209.htm">1209</a>，<a href="2504.htm">2504</a>，<a href="3365.htm">3365</a>，<a href="3384.htm">3384</a>节）。因此，“基拉耳山谷的牧人”表示那些只承认圣言字义的人。他们看不到任何其它事物，也就是任何内义的原因在于，这二者，也就是内义中的事物与字义中的事物看似相反。然而，它们看似相反并不能证明它们就真地相反。事实上，它们彼此之间存在完美的对应关系。它们之所以看似相反，是因为只看见圣言字义的人本身处于对立的状态。<br />若人处于对立状态，也就是他的外在人或属世人与他的内在人或属灵人完全不一致，其情形也一样。这种人发现属内在人或属灵人的事物仿佛与他自己对立；而事实上，就外在人或属世人而言，是他自己处在对立状态。如果他没有处在这种状态，相反，他的外在人或属世人顺从内在人或属灵人，那么这二者就会完全对应。例如：处于对立状态的人以为，为了获得永生，他必须放弃财富，以及一切肉体和世俗的欢娱，从而放弃生活的快乐；因为他以为所有这些事都与属灵的生活对立。但是，它们本身与属灵的生活并不对立，而是对应，因为它们是达到目的的手段，也就是说，它们的存在是为了使内在人或属灵人能在实践仁爱的善行中找到喜乐，另外健健康康、心满意足地生活。唯独所关注的目的使内在人和外在人要么彼此对立，要么彼此对应。当此处所论及的财富、欢娱和快乐成为目的时，它们就对立。因为在这种情况下，属内在人的属灵和属天之物遭到鄙视和嘲笑，甚至被弃绝。但当这类事物没有成为目的，而是达到更高目的，也就是那些属于死后生活，因而属于天国和主自己的事物的手段时，它们就对应。这种情况下，在此人看来，肉体和世俗事物几乎难以与刚才所提到的这些事物相提并论；并且当思想它们时，他仅仅视它们为达到目的的手段。<br />由此明显可知，看似对立的事物本身并不对立；之所以看似对立，是因为这些人自己处在对立的状态。那些没有处在对立状态的人在言行、寻求财富、追求快乐方面，和那些处在对立状态的人很相似，以致就外在表现而言，他们几乎难分彼此。原因在于，唯独他们所关注的目的，或也可说他们的爱将他们区分开来，因为爱就是目的。尽管就外在形式，或肉体而言，他们是一样的；然而，就内在形式，或灵而言，他们完全不同。若人处于对应状态，也就是外在人与内在人相对应，那么他的灵就发光、优美，就像呈为可见形式的天堂之爱。但若人处于对立状态，也就是外在人与内在人相对立，他的灵既黑且丑，就像呈为可见形式的自我之爱和尘世之爱，也就是对别人的蔑视，以及仇恨，哪怕就外在表现而言，他看上去和别人一样。<br />圣言中的许多事物都是如此，也就是说，字义中的事物与内义中的事物看似对立。然而，它们决不对立，而是彼此完全对应。例如：在圣言中，经上多次提到耶和华或主生气、发怒、毁灭、投入地狱；而事实上，祂从不生气，更不会将任何人投入地狱。前一种观念属于字义，而后一种观念属于内义。后一种观念看似对立，但这是因为人处于对立的状态。同样，主向天堂天使显为一轮太阳，因而显为春天的温暖和拂晓的光明；但向魔鬼则显为某种漆黑的东西，因而显为冬天的严寒和半夜的黑暗。结果，祂以爱与仁显现在天使面前，以仇恨和敌意显现在魔鬼面前。因此，对于后者，按照字义，祂生气、发怒、毁灭、投入地狱；而对于前者，按照内义，祂从不生气、发怒，更不会毁灭、投入地狱。故当圣言所论述的主题是与神性相反的事物时，这类表象就不可避免地出现。即便如此，以这种方式作工的，仍是神性，只是恶人将这神性变成魔鬼的东西。因此，他们越靠近神性，就越将自己投入地狱的折磨中。<br />在主祷文中，主所说“不叫我们遇见试探”的话也是这种情况。从字面上看，这句话的意思是，祂引入试探；但内义是，祂从不将任何人引入试探，如众所周知的（参看<a href="1875.htm">1875</a>节）。属圣言字义的所有其它事物也一样。</p>

<p align="center"><b>Potts(1905-1910) 3425</b></p><p><b>3425.</b>
And the shepherds of Gerar strove with Isaac's shepherds. That this signifies that they who taught did not see any such thing therein because the senses appeared opposed, is evident from the signification 
of "disputing," when the internal sense of the Word is concerned, as being to deny it to be such by saying that they do not see it; and from the signification of "shepherds," as being those who 
teach (n. 343); and from the signification of "Gerar," as being faith (n. 1209, 2504, 3365, 3384); thus "the shepherds of the valley of Gerar" denote those who acknowledge only the literal sense of the 
Word. The reason why they see no such thing, that is, no interior sense, is that the two appear opposite, namely, what is in the internal sense, and what is in the literal sense. But their appearing 
to be opposite does not prove that they are so, for they wholly correspond; and the reason they appear opposite is that they who see the Word so are in what is opposite.  [2] It is the same in the case 
of a man who is in opposition within himself, that is, whose external or natural man is in entire disagreement with his internal or spiritual man. Such a man sees that which is of the internal or 
spiritual man as opposed to himself, when yet in respect to the external or natural man, he himself is in that which is opposed; and if he were not in this, so that his external or natural man yielded 
obedience to the internal or spiritual man, the two would wholly correspond. For example: the man who is in what is opposed believes that in order for him to receive eternal life riches are to be renounced, 
as well as all the pleasures of the body and of the world, thus the delights of life; such things being supposed to be opposed to spiritual life, whereas in themselves they are not so, but correspond, 
because they are means to an end, namely, that the internal or spiritual man may enjoy them so as to be able to perform the goods of charity, and also may live content in a healthful body. The 
ends alone are what cause the internal man and the external either to be opposed or to correspond; they are opposed when the riches, pleasures, and delights here spoken of become the ends, for in this 
case the spiritual and celestial things which are of the internal man are despised and derided, nay, are rejected; but they correspond when such things are not made ends, but means to higher ends, 
namely, to those things which belong to the life after death, thus to the heavenly kingdom and the Lord Himself. In this case bodily and worldly things appear to the man as scarcely anything in comparison; 
and when he thinks about them, he values them only as means to ends.  [3] From this it is evident that the things which appear opposed are not opposed in themselves; but they appear so because 
men are in what is opposed. They who are not in what is opposed, act, speak, and acquire riches, and also enjoy pleasures, similarly as do those who are in what is opposed, insomuch that in the outward 
appearance they can scarcely be distinguished from each other. The reason is that their ends alone are what distinguish them; or what is the same, their loves; for loves are ends. But although in the 
outward form, or as to the body, they appear alike, yet in the inward form, or as to the spirit, they are utterly unlike. The spirit of one who is in correspondence-that is, with whom the external man 
corresponds to the internal-is fair and beautiful, such as is heavenly love in form; but the spirit of one who is in what is opposed-that is, with whom the external man is opposed to the internal-however 
great may be the outward resemblance to the other, is black and ugly, such as is the love of self and of the world, that is, such as is contempt of others and hatred in form.  [4] The case is 
the same with a host of things in the Word; that is to say, the things in the literal sense appear opposed to those in the internal sense; when yet they are by no means opposed, but wholly correspond. 
For example: it is frequently said in the Word that Jehovah or the Lord is angry, is wroth, destroys, and casts into hell; when yet He is never angry, and still less does He cast anyone into hell. The 
former is of the sense of the letter, but the latter is of the internal sense; and these appear opposed, but this is because the man is in what is opposed. In the same way the Lord appears as a sun 
to the angels who are in heaven, and thence as vernal warmth, and as light at dawn; but to the infernals He appears as something quite opaque, and thence as wintry cold, and as midnight darkness. Consequently 
to the angels He appears in love and charity, but to the infernals in hatred and enmity; thus to the latter according to the sense of the letter-that He is angry, is wroth, destroys, and casts 
into hell; but to the former according to the internal sense-that He is never angry and wroth, and still less destroys and casts into hell; so that when things are being treated of in the Word that 
are contrary to the Divine, it is inevitable that they should be presented in accordance with the appearance. Moreover it is the Divine which the wicked change into what is diabolical that works in this 
way; and therefore insofar as they approach the Divine, so far they cast themselves into infernal torments.  [5] The case is the same with the Lord's words in the prayer: "Lead us not into temptation." 
The sense according to the letter is that He leads into temptation; but the internal sense is that He leads no one into temptation, as is well known (see n. 1875). The same is true of all other 
things that belong to the literal sense of the Word. </p>

<p align="center"><b>Elliott(1983-1999) 3425</b></p><p><b>3425.</b>
'The herdsmen of Gerar disputed with Isaac's herdsmen' means that those who taught did not see anything of the sort there, because things in the internal sense appear contrary to those in the literal. 
This is clear from the meaning, when the internal sense of the Word is the subject, of 'disputing' as refusing to recognize any such thing - by saying that they do not see it; from the meaning of 'herdsman' 
as people who teach, dealt with in <a href="343.htm">343</a>;<A name="fntext1"></a><A href="#fn1"><sup>a</sup></a> and from the meaning of 'Gerar' as faith, dealt with in <a href="1209.htm">1209</a>, <a href="2504.htm">2504</a>, <a href="3365.htm">3365</a>, <a href="3384.htm">3384</a>. Thus 'the herdsmen of the Valley of Gerar' means those who do not acknowledge 
any sense in the Word other than its literal sense. The reason they do not see anything else - namely any interior sense - is that things appear to be contraries; that is to say, things in the 
internal sense appear to be contrary to those in the literal sense. Yet though they appear to be contrary they are not in fact so but exist in perfect correspondence with one another. The reason why 
they appear to be contrary however is that people who see only the literal sense of the Word are themselves dwelling in a state of contrariety. Anyone whose state is this - that is, in whom the external 
or natural man is totally at variance with the internal or spiritual man - sees the things that belong to the internal or spiritual man as though they stood contrary to himself, when in fact he himself 
as to his external or natural man is in a state of contrariety. And if he were not in that state, but his external or natural man were subservient to the internal or spiritual man, they would exist 
in perfect correspondence with one another. </p>
<p></p>
<p><b>[2]</b>
 For example, a person in a state of contrariety believes that to obtain eternal life he must renounce riches, and all physical and worldly pleasures, 
and so the delights of life; for he believes that all these things are contrary to spiritual life. But in themselves they are not contrary to that life but correspond to it; for they are means to 
an end, that is to say, they exist so that the internal or spiritual man may be enabled to find joy in performing the good deeds of charity, and in addition to live contentedly in a healthy body It is 
ends in view which alone cause the internal man and the external man either to be contrary or to correspond to each other. They are contrary when the riches, pleasures, and delights spoken of become 
ends in view, for in that case spiritual and celestial things that belong to the internal man are despised and ridiculed, or even simply rejected, by a person. But they correspond when they do not become 
ends but means to higher ends, that is to say, to things that belong to life after death, and so to the heavenly kingdom and to the Lord Himself. In this case bodily and worldly things appear to him 
to be hardly anything compared with those just mentioned and when he does think about them he considers them to be merely means to ends in view. </p>
<p></p>
<p><b>[3]</b>
 From these considerations it is evident that 
things that appear to be contraries are not in themselves so, but that the reason why they appear to be such is that contrariety exists within the persons themselves. Those in whom it does not exist act 
in similar ways, utter similar things, seek wealth in similar ways, and pursue similar pleasures to those in whom contrariety does exist, so much so that to outward appearance scarcely any distinction 
can be made between them. The reason for this is that solely their ends in view distinguish the former from the latter, or what amounts to the same, that which they really love distinguishes one person 
from another, for what people love they have as their end in view. But although to outward appearance, that is, as to their bodies, people are similar, they are nevertheless completely different 
inwardly, that is, as to their spirits. The spirit of one in whom correspondence exists, that is, with whom the external man corresponds to the internal man, is shining and beautiful, like heavenly love 
when presented in visible form. But the spirit of one in whom contrariety exists, that is, with whom the external man is contrary to the internal man - even though he looks like the other in external 
appearance - is dark and ugly, like self-love and love of the world, that is, like contempt for others and like hatred, when presented in a visible form. </p>
<p></p>
<p><b>[4]</b>
 It is similar with very many things 
in the Word, that is to say, those in the literal sense appear as contraries to those in the internal sense. Yet they are in no way contraries but have a perfect correspondence with one another. For 
example, in the Word reference is made many times to Jehovah or the Lord being angry, being wroth, destroying, and casting into hell, when in fact He is never angry, let alone casts anyone into hell. 
The former ideas belong to the sense of the letter, but the latter to the internal sense. The latter appear to be contraries, but this is because man dwells in a state of contrariety. It is like the Lord's 
appearing as the Sun to angels in heaven, and therefore as spring-like warmth and as light like that of the dawn, but to those in hell like something altogether darkened and therefore as cold like 
that of winter and as thick darkness like that of night - as a consequence of which angels are governed by love and charity, but those in hell by hatred and enmity. Thus to those in hell He is, as 
the sense of the letter refers to Him, one who is angry and wrathful, who destroys and casts into hell, but to the angels He is, as the internal sense portrays Him, one who is never angry and wroth, still 
less one who destroys and casts into hell. </p>
<p></p>
<p><b>[5]</b>
 When the subject in the Word therefore is things that are contrary to the Divine such appearances inevitably present themselves. Even so, it is the 
Divine - which the wicked turn into that which is of the devil - that is then at work Furthermore to the extent they draw near the Divine those in hell subject themselves to torments. Something similar 
is true of the words of the Lord's Prayer, Do not lead us into temptation. According to the letter the meaning is that He leads into temptation, but the internal sense is that He does not lead anyone 
into it, as is well known, see <a href="1875.htm">1875</a>. Similarly with everything else which occurs in the literal sense of the Word.

Quod `rixati sunt pastores Geraris cum pastoribus Jishaki' significet quod docentes non viderent ibi tale, quia apparent opposita, constat a significatione `rixari,' cum agitur de Verbi sensu interno, 
quod sit negare quod sit tale, ita dicendo se non videre illud; ex significatione `pastorum' quod sint docentes, de qua n. 343; et ex significatione `Geraris' quod sit fides, de qua n. 1209, 2504, 
3365, 3384; ita `pastores vallis Geraris' sunt illi qui non nisi quam sensum litteralem Verbi agnoscunt: causa quod non videant tale, nempe aliquem sensum interiorem, est quia apparent opposita, {1}scilicet 
illa quae in sensu interno et quae in sensu litterali; sed quod opposita appareant, {2}ideo non opposita sunt, verum prorsus correspondent; at quod opposita appareant, est quia illi qui ita Verbum 
vident, in opposito sunt; se habet hoc sicut homo qui in opposito est in se, hoc est, cujus externus seu naturalis homo prorsus dissidet ab ejus interno seu spirituali, {3}is videt illa quae interni 
seu spiritualis hominis sunt, sibi quasi opposita, cum tamen ipse quoad externum seu naturalem hominem in opposito est, et si non is in opposito esset, sed externus seu naturalis ejus homo obsequia 
praestaret interno seu spirituali, prorsus corresponderent: ut pro exemplo, qui in opposito est, credit quod abdicandae sint divitiae, ac omnes voluptates corporis et mundi, ita jucunda vitae, [2] ut 
vitam aeternam accipiat, {4}illa enim opposita creduntur vitae spirituali; at in se non opposita sunt, sed correspondent; sunt enim media finis, ut nempe internus seu spiritualis homo illis frui queat 
ad bona charitatis exercenda, (c)et praeterea ut contentus in salubri corpore vivat; sunt fines qui unice faciunt quod internus homo et externus vel oppositi sint, vel correspondeant; oppositi sunt 
quando divitiae, voluptates et jucunda, de quibus dictum, fiunt fines, tunc enim spiritualia et caelestia, quae sunt interni hominis, contemnit {5}et subsannat, immo rejicit; at correspondent quando illa 
non fiunt fines sed media ad fines superiores, nempe ad illa quae sunt vitae post mortem, ita regni caelestis ac Ipsius Domini, tunc {6}corporea et mundana apparent illi vix aliquid respective, et 
cum de illis cogitat, modo ut media ad fines aestimat; inde patet quod illa quae apparent opposita, non in se opposita sint; [3] sed quod ita appareant, sit {7}quia illi in opposito sunt: qui non in 
opposito sunt, similiter agunt, similiter loquuntur, similiter ambiunt divitias, et quoque {8}similiter voluptates captant, sicut illi qui in opposito sunt, usque adeo ut externa facie vix dignosci queant; 
causa est quia soli fines sunt qui distinguunt, seu quod idem, amores, nam amores sunt fines; at tametsi similes apparent forma externa seu quoad corpus, usque tamen prorsus dissimiles sunt forma 
interna seu quoad spiritum; qui in correspondentia {9}est, hoc est, apud {10}quem interno homini correspondet externus, ejus spiritus est candidus {11}et pulcher, qualis est amor caelestis in forma; 
at qui in opposito {9}est, hoc est, apud {10}quem externus homo oppositus est interno, utcumque similitudo est cum altero quoad externum, ejus spiritus est niger (c)et deformis, {12}qualis est amor sui 
et mundi, hoc est, qualis contemptus aliorum et quale odium, in forma. [4] Similiter se habet cum perplurimis in Verbo, quod nempe quae in sensu litterali sunt, appareant opposita illis quae in sensu 
interno sunt, cum tamen nusquam opposita sint, sed prorsus correspondeant; ut pro exemplo, in Verbo pluries dicitur quod Jehovah seu Dominus irascatur, excandescat, vastet, conjiciat in infernum, cum 
tamen nusquam irascatur, minus conjiciat aliquem in infernum; illud est sensus litterae, hoc autem est sensus interni; haec apparent opposita, sed ex causa quia homo in opposito est; se habet hoc, 
sicut quod Dominus appareat ut Sol angelis qui in caelo, et inde ut calor quasi vernus, et ut lux quasi aurorae; at infernalibus sicut prorsus opacum quid, et inde ut frigus quasi hiemis, ac ut caligo 
quasi noctis; proinde angelis in amore et charitate, sed infernalibus in odio et hostilitate; ita his secundum sensum litterae, quod irascatur, excandescat, vastet, conjiciat in infernum, illis autem 
secundum sensum internum quod nusquam irascatur et excandescat, minus quod vastet et conjiciat in infernum; [5] cum itaque agitur in Verbo de illis quae contraria Divino sunt, illa non (t)possunt aliter 
quam secundum apparentiam ita sisti; etiam Divinum est quod quia mali vertunt in diabolicum, hoc sic operatur; quare etiam quantum ad Divinum {13}approximant, tantum in cruciatus infernales se conjiciunt. 
Similiter se habet cum verbis Domini in Oratione, `Ne inducas nos in tentationem;' sensus secundum litteram est quod inducat in tentationem: sensus autem internus est quod neminem inducat, ut 
notum est, videatur n. 1875; similiter se habet cum reliquis quae {14}sensus litteralis Verbi sunt. @1 nempe$  @2 non usque$  @3 ille quia in opposito est, videt illa quae interni seu spiritualis
