<h3 align="center" class="ired">属天的奥秘 第1941节</h3>
<h4 align="center"></h4><p><strong>1941.</strong>“多到不可胜数”表无限量地繁殖。这是显而易见的，无需解释。这些话表示以这种方式通过良善无限增多的真理。因为对主而言（在内义上，祂就是此处论述的主题），这些事无法用言语来表达，因为祂里面的所有事物都是神性和无限的。所以，为了能对真理通过良善的这种增多获得某种概念，我们必须说说有关人的情况。对于受良善，即受爱与仁支配的人来说，来自主的种子会繁殖增多，甚至多到不可胜数。这种繁殖增多在他活在肉身期间并没有那么多，但到了来世，则会达到令人难以置信的程度。因为只要他还活在肉身，这种子就在肉土里，在灌木丛林，就是记忆知识和肉体娱乐，以及挂心忧虑当中。不过，等到他进入来世后，一旦这些东西被抛弃，这种子就从这些事物中被释放出来，并开始生长，就象树的种子破土而出，长成幼苗，继而长成参天大树，然后繁殖增多，变成一片树林。因为一切知识、聪明和智慧，连同它们的快乐、幸福，就是如此繁殖增多，从而增长到永恒的。它们也是从最小的种子开始的，如主针对芥菜种所教导的（马太福音<a href="http://39-27.cn/太13.31.htm">13:31</a>）。这一点可从天使的知识、聪明和智慧很清楚地看出来，他们还是世人时，这些对他们来说是无以言表的。</p>

And it shall not be numbered for multitude. That this signifies multiplication beyond measure, is evident without explication. By these words is signified the truth that, from good, will thus grow multitudinously. 
In the case of the Lord-who in the internal sense is here treated of-these things cannot be fully expressed in words, because in Him all things are Divine and Infinite, and therefore in 
order that we may form some idea of how the case is with the multiplication of truth from good, we must speak concerning man. With a man who is in good, that is, in love and charity, the seed that comes 
from the Lord is made fruitful and multiplied to such an extent that it cannot be numbered for multitude; not so much while he is living in the body, but in the other life to an incredible degree; 
for so long as a man is living in the body the seed is in corporeal ground, and is there in the midst of jungles and thickets, which are memory-knowledges and pleasures, and also cares and anxieties; 
but when these are put off, which is done when he passes into the other life, the seed is freed from them and grows, just as the seed of a tree uprising from the ground grows into a sapling, then into 
a great tree, which is afterwards multiplied into a garden of trees. For all memory-knowledge [scientia], intelligence, and wisdom, together with their delights and happiness, are thus made fruitful 
and multiplied, and thereby increase to eternity, and this from the smallest seed, as the Lord teaches respecting the grain of mustard seed (Matt. 13:31). This may be seen very clearly from the knowledge, 
intelligence, and wisdom of the angels, which while they were men had been to them unutterable. </p>

'And it will not be numbered for multitude' means being multiplied immeasurably. This is clear without explanation. By these words is meant the truth which in this manner will increase immeasurably from 
good. Because with the Lord, who is the subject here in the internal sense, all things are Divine and Infinite, these matters as they apply to Him cannot be put into words. Consequently, so that some 
idea may be obtained of what the multiplication of truth from good entails, it must be spoken of as it applies to man. In his case, if governed by good, that is, by love and charity, seed from the 
Lord is made fruitful and is multiplied to such an extent that it cannot be numbered for multitude. That fruitfulness and multiplication is not very much during his life in the body, but in the next 
life it is unbelievably increased, for as long as he lives in the body it is seed Lying in ground of a bodily nature, among an entangled and dense mass of factual knowledge and bodily delights, and also 
cares and anxieties. But once these have been cast off, as happens when he passes over into the next life, the seed is set free from those things and starts to grow, just like the seed of a tree which, 
when it comes up out of the ground, grows into a small tree, then into a large tree, and is after that multiplied into a garden of trees. For all knowledge, intelligence, and wisdom, and the forms 
of delight and happiness that go with them, are in a similar way made fruitful and are multiplied, and are thereby for ever increasing. And they begin from the smallest of seeds, as the Lord teaches 
in <a href="http://bible.gospelcom.net/cgi-bin/bible?passage=Matt%2013:31&amp;version=ESV&amp;interface=print&amp;showfn=yes&amp;showxref">Matt 13:31</a>, by reference to the grain of mustard seed. This becomes quite clear from the knowledge, intelligence, and wisdom that angels possess, which during the time they were men had been to them 
beyond words. </p>

`Et non numerabitur prae multitudine': quod significet multiplicationem in immensum, constat absque explicatione; per haec significatur verum, quod sic multitudine crescet a bono: apud Dominum, de Quo 
hic in sensu interno agitur, quia Divina et Infinita omnia, illa non sunt expressibilia, quare ut idea possit aliqua capi quomodo se habet cum multiplicatione veri ex bono, de homine dicendum: apud 
hominem qui in bono est, hoc est, {1}in amore et charitate, semen a Domino ita fructificatur et multiplicatur ut prae multitudine numerari nequeat; dum vivit in corpore non ita, sed in altera vita incredibiliter; 
quamdiu enim homo in corpore vivit, est semen in humo corporea, et ibi inter implexa et densa quae sunt scientifica et voluptates, tum curae et sollicitudines; at his exutis, quod fit dum 
transit in alteram vitam, semen exsolvitur illis, et excrescit, sicut solet semen arboris cum surgit ex humo, crescere in virgultum, tum in magnam arborem, et dein multiplicari in arborum hortum; omnis 
enim scientia, intelligentia et sapientia, et illarum jucunda et felicia ita fructificantur et multiplicantur, et sic crescunt in aeternum, et hoc ex minimo semine, ut Dominus docet de grano sinapis, 
Matth. xiii 31, quod satis constare potest (c)a scientia, intelligentia, et sapientia angelorum, quae tunc, cum fuerunt homines, illis fuit ineffabilis. @1 i qui.$ </p>
