<p><strong>[NCE]1184.</strong> <a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_1184/bible_king-james-version_genesis_10_11-12" target=_top>Genesis 10:11-12</a>. From that same land, Asshur went out and built Nineveh, and the city Rehoboth, and Calah, and Resen, between Nineveh and Calah (this is the great city).<br />From that same land, Asshur went out, means that those who practiced this shallow kind of worship started to reason falsely about the deeper qualities of devotion; Asshur is skewed reasoning. And built Nineveh, and the city Rehoboth, and Calah, means that in this way they created doctrines for themselves about faith; Nineveh symbolizes the false elements of the doctrines; Rehoboth and Calah symbolize the same things from a different source. Resen, between Nineveh and Calah, means that they also created doctrines for themselves about how to live. Resen symbolizes the false elements of doctrine that resulted; Nineveh is falsity that rises out of faulty reasoning; Calah is falsity that stems from our cravings; and between Nineveh and Calah means falsity from both of these. This is the great city symbolizes doctrinal positions and the fact that they proliferated. </p>

Verses 11, 12. Out of that land went forth Asshur, and built Nineveh, and the city of Rehoboth, and Calah, and Resen, between Nineveh and Calah; this is that great city. "Out of that land went forth 
Asshur," signifies that they who were in such external worship began to reason about the internals of worship; "Asshur" denotes reasoning; "and built Nineveh, and the city of Rehoboth, and Calah," signifies 
that thereby they formed doctrinals of faith for themselves; by "Nineveh" are signified the falsities of these doctrinals; by "Rehoboth and Calah," the same from another origin; "Resen, between 
Nineveh and Calah," signifies that they also formed for themselves doctrinals of life. By "Resen" are signified falsities of doctrinals thence derived; "Nineveh" is falsity from reasonings; "Calah" is 
falsity from cupidities; "between Nineveh and Calah," is falsity from both; "this is that great city," signifies doctrinals, that these increased and prevailed. </p>

<p align="center"><b>Elliott(1983-1999) 1184</b></p><p><b>1184.</b>
Verses 11, 12 Out of that land went Asshur, and built Nineveh, and Rehoboth city, and Calah, and Resen between Nineveh and Calah; this is that great city. </p>
<p>'Out of that land went Asshur' means that 
those with whom such external worship existed started to engage in reasoning about the internal aspects of worship, 'Asshur' being reasoning. 'And he built Nineveh, and Rehoboth city, and Calah' means 
that in this way they formulated for themselves doctrinal teachings concerning faith - 'Nineveh' means falsities contained in those teachings, as do 'Rehoboth and Calah' though falsities from a different 
source. 'Resen between Nineveh and Calah' means that they also formulated for themselves doctrinal teachings concerning life -'Resen' means derivative falsities contained in doctrinal teachings. 
'Nineveh' is falsity that results from reasonings, 'Calah' falsity that results from evil desires; 'between Nineveh and Calah' is falsity resulting from both. 'This is that great city' means that those 
matters of doctrine prevailed more and more. </p>

Vers. 11, 12. E terra ista egressus est Asshur, et aedificavit Niniven, et Rehoboth urbem, et Calah.  Et Resen inter Niniven et inter Calah; haec urbs illa magna.  'E terra ista egressus est Asshur' 
significat qui in tali cultu externo fuerunt, coeperint ratiocinari de internis cultus; 'Asshur' est ratiocinatio:  'et aedificavit Niniven, et Rehoboth urbem, et Calah' significat quod sic doctrinalia 
fidei sibi formaverint; per 'Niniven' significantur doctrinalium falsa:  per 'Rehoboth et  Calah' quoque talia ex alia origine:  'Resen inter Niniven et Calah' significat quod quoque formaverint sibi 
doctrinalia vitae; per 'Resen' significantur doctrinalium falsa inde; 'Niniveh' est falsum ex Ratiociniis; 'Calah' est falsum a cupiditatibus; 'inter Niniven et Calah' est falsum ex utroque; 'haec 
urbs illa magna' significat doctrinalia quod illa increbruerint. </p>
