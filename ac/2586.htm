<h3 align="center" class="ired">属天的奥秘 第2586节</h3>
<h4 align="center"></h4><p><strong>2586.</strong>“耶和华关闭了亚比米勒家的一切子宫”表不孕，也就是说，教义的不孕。这从彻底“关闭子宫”和“亚比米勒家”的含义清楚可知：彻底“关闭子宫”就是防止怀孕本身；“亚比米勒家”是指属于信之教义的良善，由此明显可知所表示的是不孕。在本章，此前经上一直用“神”这个名，现在首次提到“耶和华”。这是因为，当论述的主题是真理时，经上就用“神”；当论述的主题是良善时，经上就用“耶和华”。教义全都从作为父亲的良善成孕，并经由作为母亲的真理出生，如前面数次说明的。此处论述的正是教义的孕育，并且由于教义从良善成孕，故经上用“耶和华”这个名。而上面论述的是它的出生，并且由于它经由真理出生，故经上便用“神”这个名，如前一节：“神就医好亚比米勒和他的妻子，以及他的女仆们，她们便能生育”。<br />在圣言中，凡涉及孕育的其它地方，也是这种情况，如以赛亚书：<br />耶和华从子宫中选召我；从子宫作成我的耶和华这样说；原来耶和华看我为尊贵，我的神也成为我的力量。（以赛亚书<a href="http://39-27.cn/赛49.1.htm">49:1</a>，<a href="http://39-27.cn/赛49.5.htm">5</a>）<br />“力量”是称谓真理的，故经上提及“神”。同一先知书：<br />造作你，又从你子宫造就你的耶和华如此说。（以赛亚书<a href="http://39-27.cn/赛44.2.htm">44:2</a>，<a href="http://39-27.cn/赛44.24.htm">24</a>等）<br />由于同样的原因，经上说“亚比米勒家”，“亚比米勒家”是指信之教义的良善，“家”表良善（参看<a href="2048.htm">2048</a>，<a href="2233.htm">2233</a>，<a href="2234.htm">2234</a>节），“亚比米勒”表信之教义（参看<a href="2509.htm">2509</a>，<a href="2510.htm">2510</a>节）。显然，“她们便能生育”和“因撒拉的缘故关闭了亚比米勒家的子宫”这些经文里面含有神性奥秘，并且这个奥秘若不通过内义，无法被揭开。</p>

<p align="center"><b>Potts(1905-1910) 2586</b></p><p><b>2586.</b>
For closing Jehovah had therefore closed every womb of the house of Abimelech. That this signifies barrenness, namely, of doctrine, is evident from the signification of "closing to close up the womb," 
as being to prevent conception itself; and from the signification of "the house of Abimelech," as being the good of the doctrine of faith, which shows that barrenness is signified. That up to this point 
in this chapter "God" is mentioned, but here for the first time "Jehovah," is because "God" is mentioned where the subject is truth, but "Jehovah" where the subject is good. All the conception of 
doctrine is from good as a father, but its birth is by means of truth as a mother, as occasionally stated before. Here the conception of doctrine is treated of, and as this is from good, "Jehovah" is 
mentioned; whereas above its birth is treated of, and as this takes place by means of truth, "God" is mentioned, as in the verse preceding: "God healed Abimelech, and his wife, and his maidservants, 
and they brought forth." [2] The case is the same elsewhere in the Word where conception is treated of, as in Isaiah: </p>
<p>     Jehovah hath called me from the womb. Thus saith Jehovah that formed me from 
the womb; then shall I be precious to Jehovah; and my God shall be my strength (Isa. 49:1, 5); </p>
<p>"strength" is predicated of truth, and therefore "God" is mentioned. In the same: </p>
<p>     Thus saith Jehovah 
thy Maker, and thy Former from the womb (Isa. 44:2, 24, and elsewhere). For the same reason it is said "the house of Abimelech," by which is signified the good of the doctrine of faith (that a "house" 
denotes good may be seen above, n. 2048, 2233, 2234; and that "Abimelech" denotes the doctrine of faith, n. 2509, 2510). That there is a Divine arcanum in the fact that they brought forth, and 
that the wombs of the house of Abimelech were shut on account of Sarah, is manifest; and this arcanum cannot possibly be disclosed except by the internal sense. </p>

<p align="center"><b>Elliott(1983-1999) 2586</b></p><p><b>2586.</b>
'For Jehovah had completely closed every womb of Abimelech's house' means sterility, that is to say, of doctrine. This is clear from the meaning of 'completely closing the womb' as preventing conception 
itself, and from the meaning of 'Abimelech's house' as the good that belongs to the doctrine of faith, from which it is evident that sterility is meant. The reason why in this chapter the name 'God' 
is used up to this point, and 'Jehovah' for the first time now, is that 'God' is used when truth is the subject but 'Jehovah' when good is the subject. Doctrine is conceived wholly from good as the 
father, but birth is given to it through truth as the mother, as stated several times already. Here it is the conception of it that is dealt with, and because it is conceived from good the name 'Jehovah' 
is used; but above it is the birth of it that is dealt with, and because it is given birth through truth the name 'God' is used, as in the previous verse, 'God healed Abimelech, his wife, and his 
women servants, and they gave birth'. </p>
<p></p>
<p><b>[2]</b>
 Similarly in other places in the Word where conception is referred to, as in Isaiah, </p>
<blockquote>
Jehovah has called me from the womb. Jehovah who formed me from the 
womb has said.... I will at that time be precious to Jehovah, and my God will be my strength. <a href="http://bible.gospelcom.net/cgi-bin/bible?passage=Isa%2049:%201,%205&amp;version=ESV&amp;interface=print&amp;showfn=yes&amp;showxref">Isa 49: 1, 5</a>. 
</blockquote>
<p>'Strength' has reference to truth and therefore 'God' is used. In the same prophet, </p>
<blockquote>
Thus 
said Jehovah, your Maker, and He who formed you from the womb. <a href="http://bible.gospelcom.net/cgi-bin/bible?passage=Isa%2044:%202,%2024&amp;version=ESV&amp;interface=print&amp;showfn=yes&amp;showxref">Isa 44: 2, 24</a>. 
</blockquote>
<p>And elsewhere. For the same reason also the phrase 'Abimelech's house' is used, which means the good that belongs 
to the doctrine of faith. As regards 'a house' meaning good, see <a href="2048.htm">2048</a>, <a href="2233.htm">2233</a>, and 'Abimelech' the doctrine of faith, <a href="2509.htm">2509</a>, <a href="2510.htm">2510</a>. The statements that 'they gave birth' and 'the wombs of Abimelech's house 
were closed on account of Sarah', it is evident, hold a Divine arcanum within them, but this arcanum cannot possibly be disclosed except by means of the internal sense. </p>

</p><b>2586.</b>
`Quia claudendo clausit Jehovah propterea omnem uterum domus Abimelechi':  quod significet sterilitatem, nempe doctrinae, constat a significatione `claudendo claudere uterum' quod sit inhibere ipsam 
conceptionem, (o)et a significatione domus Abimelechi' quod sit bonum doctrinae fidei; inde quod sterilitas significetur, patet.  Quod supra in hoc capite dictum sit `Deus,' hic autem primum `Jehovah,' 
est quia Deus dicitur ubi de vero, at Jehovah ubi de bono, agitur; omnis conceptio doctrinae est ex bono ut patre, at partus per verum ut a matre, ut aliquoties prius dictum est; hic agitur de conceptione 
quae quia ex bono, nominatur Jehovah, supra autem de partu qui quia per verum, dicitur Deus, ut in versu praecedente, [2] `Sanavit Deus Abimelechum, uxorem ejus, et ancillas ejus, et pepererunt'; 
similiter etiam alibi in Verbo ubi agitur de conceptione, ut apud Esaiam, 	Jehovah ab utero vocavit me:... dixit Jehovah formator meus ab utero;... tunc pretiosus ero Jehovae; et Deus meus erit robur 
meum, xlix 1, 5, (m)`robur' praedicatur de vero, quare dicitur `Deus'(n): apud eundem, 	Sic dixit Jehovah, factor tuus, et formator tuus ab utero, xliv 2, 24, et alibi; ideo quoque dicitur `domus 
Abimelechi,' per quam significatur bonum doctrinae fidei; quod `domus' sit bonum, videatur n. 2048, (x)2233; et quod `Abimelechus' doctrina fidei, n.  2509, 2510. Quod arcanum Divinum sit in eo quod 
`pepererunt'; et quod `clausi sint uteri domus Abimelechi, propter Saram' patet, quod arcanum nusquam nisi per sensum internum detegitur. </p>
