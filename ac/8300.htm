<h3 align="center" class="ired">属天的奥秘 第8300节</h3>
<h4 align="center"></h4><p><strong>8300.</strong>出埃及记15:11-13.耶和华啊，众神之中谁能像你？谁能像你神圣威严，可颂可畏，施行奇事？你伸出右手，地便吞灭他们。你凭你的慈爱引领你所赎回的这百姓；你凭你的力量引领他们到你的圣所。<br />“耶和华啊，众神之中谁能像你”表一切良善之真理皆从主的神性人身发出。“谁能像你神圣威严”表祂是一切神圣事物的源头。“可颂可畏”表荣耀和感恩唯独属于祂。“施行奇事”表祂是一切方法的源头，能力通过这些方法而来。“你伸出右手”表行使掌控一切事物的能力由此变得明显。“地便吞灭他们”表仅仅由于祂的同在，诅咒和地狱便临到他们。“你凭你的慈爱引领这百姓”表神性流入那些放弃邪恶，从而接受良善的人当中。“你所赎回的”表祂把他们从地狱中释放出来。“你凭你的力量引领他们到你的圣所”表主的神性能力把他们提上天堂。提升至那里的神性。</p>

Verses 11-13. Who is like Thee, O Jehovah, among the gods? Who is like Thee, magnificent in holiness, to be revered with praises, doing what is wonderful? Thou stretchedst out Thy right hand, and the 
earth swallowed them. In Thy mercy Thou hast led this people that Thou hast redeemed; Thou hast conducted them in Thy strength to the habitation of Thy holiness. "Who is like Thee, O Jehovah, among the 
gods," signifies that all the truth of good proceeds from the Divine Human; "who is like Thee, magnificent in holiness," signifies that from Him is all that is holy; "to be revered with praises," signifies 
that to Him alone belong glory and thanksgiving; "doing what is wonderful," signifies that from Him are all the means by which is power; "Thou stretchedst out Thy right hand," signifies that 
the rule of power over all things thence appeared; "the earth swallowed them," signifies that by virtue of mere presence they had damnation and hell; "in Thy mercy Thou hast led this people," signifies 
the Divine influx with those who had abstained from evils, and so had received good; "that Thou hast redeemed," signifies whom He liberated from hell; "Thou hast conducted them in Thy strength to the 
habitation of Thy holiness," signifies that the Divine power of the Lord raised them to heaven into the Divine there. </p>

Verses 11-13 Who is like You among the gods, O Jehovah? Who is like You, magnificent in holiness, to be venerated with praises, doing wonders? You stretched out Your right hand, the earth swallowed them. 
In Your mercy You have led this people [whom] you have redeemed; in Your strength You have brought them to the dwelling-place of Your holiness. </p>
<p>'Who is like You among the gods, O Jehovah?' means 
that every truth of good emanates from the Lord's Divine Human. 'Who is like You in holiness' means that He is the Source of everything holy. 'To be venerated with praises' means that to Him alone 
belong glory and thanksgiving. 'Doing wonders?' means that He is the Source of all the means through which comes power. 'You stretched out Your right hand' means that the exercising of power over all 
things became apparent from this. 'The earth swallowed them' means that as a result simply of His presence damnation and hell befell them. 'In Your mercy You have led this people' means the Divine flowing 
in among those who have been refraining from evils and consequently receiving good. 'You have redeemed' means those whom He has delivered from hell. 'In Your strength You have brought them to the 
dwelling-place of Your holiness' means that the Lord's Divine power has raised them to heaven, to the Divine there. </p>

Vers. 11-13.  Quis sicut Tu in diis, Jehovah? quis sicut Tu, magnificus in sanctitate, venerandus laudibus, faciens mirabile?  Extendisti dextram Tuam, {1} absorpsit illos terra.  Duxisti in misericordia 
Tua populum illum, redemisti; deduxisti in virtute Tua ad habitaculum sanctitatis Tuae.  `Quis sicut Tu in diis, Jehovah?' significat quod omne verum boni a Divino Humano Domini procedat: `quis 
sicut Tu in sanctitate' significat ab Ipso omne sanctum: `venerandus laudibus' significat {2}quod Ipsi soli gloria et gratiarum actio: `faciens mirabile?' significat quod ab Ipso omnia media per quae 
potentia: extendisti dextram Tuam' significat quod dominium potentiae super omnia inde (x)apparuerit: `absorpsit illos terra' significat quod ex sola praesentia illis damnatio ac infernum: `duxisti in 
misericordia Tua populum illum' significat Divinum influxum apud illos qui abstinuerant a malis et sic receperant bonum: `redemisti' significat quos liberavit ab inferno: `deduxisti in virtute Tua ad 
habitaculum sanctitatis Tuae' significat quod Divina Domini potentia elevaverit illos ad caelum in Divinum ibi. 	@1 i et I$ 	@2 quo$ </p>
