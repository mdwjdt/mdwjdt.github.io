<h3 align="center" class="ired">属天的奥秘 第4334节</h3>
<h4 align="center"></h4><p><strong>4334.</strong>“那日子、那时辰，没有人知道”表示就良善与真理而言，那时教会的状态，即它不会向任何人显现，无论是在地上还是在天上。因为“日子和时辰”在此不是指日子和时辰，或时间；而是指在良善与真理上的状态。在圣言中，时间表示状态（参看<a href="2625.htm">2625</a>，<a href="2788.htm">2788</a>，<a href="2837.htm">2837</a>，<a href="3254.htm">3254</a>，<a href="3356.htm">3356</a>节）；“日子”也是（<a href="23.htm">23</a>，<a href="487.htm">487</a>，<a href="488.htm">488</a>，<a href="493.htm">493</a>，<a href="893.htm">893</a>，<a href="2788.htm">2788</a>，<a href="3462.htm">3462</a>，<a href="3785.htm">3785</a>节）；因此，“时辰”描述的也是状态，不过是某个具体状态。之所以在此是指良善与真理上的状态，是因为所论述的主题是教会，因为良善与真 理构成教会。<br />“连天上的使者也不知道，惟独父知道”表示天堂不知道教会在具体的良善与真理方面的状态，唯独主知道，甚至也不知道教会的这个状态什么时候到来。“父”表示主自己（参看<a href="15.htm">15</a>，<a href="1729.htm">1729</a>，<a href="2004.htm">2004</a>，<a href="2005.htm">2005</a>，<a href="3690.htm">3690</a>节）；主里面的神性良善被称为“父”，源于神性良善的神性真理被称为“子”（<a href="2803.htm">2803</a>，<a href="3703.htm">3703</a>，<a href="3704.htm">3704</a>，<a href="3736.htm">3736</a>节）。因此，认为父是一位，子是另一位，将他们彼此分开的人并不理解圣经。<br />“当洪水以前的日子”表示那些属于教会的人所经历的荒废状态。这种状态好比第一代或上古教会所经历的荒废状态；其世代的完结或最后的审判在圣言中以“大洪水”来描述。因为“大洪水”表示邪恶与虚假的泛滥，以及由此导致的那世代的完结（参看<a href="310.htm">310</a>，<a href="660.htm">660</a>，<a href="662.htm">662</a>，<a href="705.htm">705</a>，<a href="739.htm">739</a>，<a href="790.htm">790</a>，<a href="805.htm">805</a>，<a href="1120.htm">1120</a>节）。“日子”表示状态（参看前文）<br />“人照常吃喝嫁娶”表示他们在将邪恶与虚假变成自己的并由此与这些结合方面的状态。“吃”表示将良善变成自己的，“喝”表示将真理变成自己的（参看<a href="3168.htm">3168</a>，<a href="3513.htm">3513</a>e，<a href="3596.htm">3596</a>节）；因此在反面意义上表示将邪恶与虚假变成自己的。“娶”表示与邪恶结合，“嫁”表示与虚假结合；这一点从关于婚姻和婚姻之爱的阐述和说明（<a href="686.htm">686</a>，<a href="2173.htm">2173</a>，<a href="2618.htm">2618</a>，<a href="2728.htm">2728</a>，<a href="2729.htm">2729</a>，<a href="2737.htm">2737</a>-<a href="2739.htm">2739</a>，<a href="2803.htm">2803</a>，<a href="3132.htm">3132</a>，<a href="3155.htm">3155</a>节）可以看出来，大意是：就内义而言，它们表示良善与真理的结合，此处在反面意义上则表示邪恶与虚假的结合。主所说的一切话都是神性，故在内义上具有与字义不同的性质。因此，圣餐中的吃和喝在灵义上并非表示吃和喝，而表示将主的神性之爱变成自己的（<a href="2165.htm">2165</a>，<a href="2177.htm">2177</a>，<a href="2187.htm">2187</a>，<a href="2343.htm">2343</a>，<a href="2359.htm">2359</a>，<a href="3464.htm">3464</a>，<a href="3478.htm">3478</a>，<a href="3735.htm">3735</a>，<a href="4211.htm">4211</a>，<a href="4217.htm">4217</a>节）。当婚姻的概念用于教会或主的国度时，所指的是爱之良善与信之真理的结合，所以在圣言中，主的国度凭这种结合而被称为天上的婚姻。<br />“直到挪亚进方舟的那日”表示前教会的结束和新教会的开始。因为“挪亚”表示大洪水后总体上取代上古教会的古教会（<a href="773.htm">773</a>节及别处）；“方舟”表示教会本身（<a href="639.htm">639</a>节）。这几节数次所提到的“日子”表示状态，如前所示。<br />“不知不觉洪水来了，把他们全都冲去”表示那时，教会中人不知道他们被邪恶与虚假淹没，因为由于他们所陷入的邪恶与虚假，他们不知道何为对主之爱的良善和对邻之仁的良善，以及何为信之真理。他们也不会知道这种真理源于这些良善的形式，只可能存在于过着充满这种爱和仁的生活之人当中。他们同样不知道以下事实：那拯救人或定人罪的是内在，而不是脱离内在的外在。<br />“人子降临也要这样”表示他们不会接受的神性真理。前面（马太福音<a href="http://39-27.cn/太24.27.htm">24:27</a>，<a href="http://39-27.cn/太24.30.htm">30</a>）已经说明，“人子降临”是指那时将要被揭示的神性真理（<a href="2803.htm">2803</a>，<a href="2813.htm">2813</a>，<a href="3704.htm">3704</a>，<a href="3004.htm">3004</a>-<a href="3006.htm">3006</a>，<a href="3008.htm">3008</a>，<a href="3009.htm">3009</a>节）。<br />“那时，两个人在田里，取去一个，撇下一个”表示教会中那些处于良善的人和那些陷入邪恶的人。那些处于良善的人将得救，那些陷入邪恶的人将被定罪。“田”表示教会的良善（参看<a href="2971.htm">2971</a>，<a href="3196.htm">3196</a>，<a href="3310.htm">3310</a>，<a href="3317.htm">3317</a>，<a href="3766.htm">3766</a>节）。<br />“两个女人在磨房里推磨，取去一个，撇下一个”表示教会中那些处于真理，也就是在良善引导下拥有对真理的情感之人，他们将得救；以及教会中那些处于真理，也就是在邪恶的引导下拥有对真理的情感之人，他们将被定罪。在圣言中，“推磨”和“磨坊”就具有这样的含义，这一点从接下来的内容明显看出来。由此明显可知，这些话描述了当教会被弃绝，一个新教会被采用时，良善与真理在教会中是何状态。</p>

<p align="center"><b>Potts(1905-1910) 4334</b></p><p><b>4334.</b>
But of that day and hour knoweth no one; </p>
<p>signifies the state of the church at that time as to goods and truths, that it would not appear to anyone, neither on earth nor in heaven. For by "day and hour" 
here is not meant day and hour, or time; but state as to good and truth. That times in the Word signify states, see n. 2625, 2788, 2837, 3254, 3356; as also do "days," n. 23, 487, 488, 493, 893, 2788, 
3462, 3785; and thence also hours, but specifically state. That it is here state as to good and truth, is because the subject treated of is the church, for good and truth make the church.      [2] 
Not the angels of the heavens, but My Father only; </p>
<p>signifies that heaven does not know the state of the church as to good and truth specifically, but the Lord alone, and also when that state of the 
church will come. That the Lord Himself is meant by the "Father," see n. 15, 1729, 2004, 2005, 3690; and that the Divine Good in the Lord is what is called the "Father," and the Divine Truth from the 
Divine Good "the Son," n. 2803, 3703, 3704, 3736; and therefore they who believe that the Father is one and the Son another, and who separate them from each other, do not understand the Scriptures.  
    [3] For as they were in the days before the flood; </p>
<p>     signifies the state of vastation of those who are of the church, which is compared to the state of vastation of the first or Most Ancient 
Church; the consummation of the age or Last Judgment of which is described in the Word by the "flood." That by the "flood" is signified an inundation of evils and falsities and the consequent consummation 
of that age, see n. 310, 660, 662, 705, 739, 790, 805, 1120. That "days" signify states, see above. [4] Eating and drinking, marrying and giving in marriage; </p>
<p>     signifies their state as to the 
appropriation of evil and falsity, and the consequent conjunction with these. That "to eat" denotes the appropriation of good, and "to drink" the appropriation of truth, see n. 3168, 3513e, 3596; thus 
in the opposite sense the appropriation of evil and falsity. That "to marry" denotes conjunction with evil, and "to give in marriage," conjunction with falsity, may be seen from what has been said 
and shown respecting marriage and conjugial love (n. 686, 2173, 2618, 2728, 2729, 2737-2739, 2803, 3132, 3155), namely, that in the internal sense this is the conjunction of good and truth, but here 
in the opposite sense the conjunction of evil and falsity. Whatever the Lord spoke, being Divine, is not the same in the internal sense as in the letter. Thus eating and drinking in the Holy Supper do 
not signify in the spiritual sense eating and drinking, but the appropriation of the good of the Lord's Divine love (n. 2165, 2177, 2187, 2343, 2359, 3464, 3478, 3735, 4211, 4217). And as when predicated 
of the church and the Lord's kingdom the conjugial is the conjunction of the good of love with the truth of faith, therefore from this conjunction the Lord's kingdom is called in the Word the heavenly 
marriage.      [5] Until the day that Noah entered into the ark; </p>
<p>signifies the end of the former church, and the beginning of the new. For by "Noah" is signified the Ancient Church in general 
which succeeded the Most Ancient after the flood (n. 773, and elsewhere); and by the "ark," the church itself (n. 639). "Day," which is mentioned several times in these verses, signifies state, as shown 
just above.      [6] And knew not until the flood came, and took them all away; </p>
<p>signifies that the men of the church will not then know that they are inundated by evils and falsities, because on 
account of the evils and falsities in which they are they will not know what the good of love to the Lord is, and the good of charity toward the neighbor, and also what the truth of faith, and that this 
is from that love and charity, and is not possible except with those who live in this love and in this charity. They will also be ignorant that the internal is what saves and condemns, but not the 
external separate from the internal.      [7] So shall the coming of the Son of man be; </p>
<p>signifies the Divine Truth, and that they will not receive it. It has been said before (Mat. 24:27, 30), that 
the "coming of the Son of man" is the Divine Truth which will then be revealed (also in n. 2803, 2813, 3004-3009, and 3704).      [8] Then shall two be in the field; one shall be taken, and one shall 
be left; </p>
<p>signifies those within the church who are in good, and those within the church who are in evil-that they who are in good will be saved, and that they who are in evil will be condemned. That 
a "field" denotes the church as to good, see n. 2971, 3196, 3310, 3317, 3766.      [9] Two women shall be grinding at the mill; one shall be taken, and one shall be left; </p>
<p>signifies those within the 
church who are in truth, that is, in the affection of it from good, that they will be saved; and those within the church who are in truth, that is, in the affection of it from evil, that they will be 
condemned. That in the Word "to grind," and a "mill" have this signification, will be evident from what now follows. From all this it is now evident that by these words is described what the state as 
to good and truth will be within the church when it is being rejected, and a new church is being adopted. </p>

<p align="center"><b>Elliott(1983-1999) 4334</b></p><p><b>4334.</b>
But of that day and hour no one knows means that the state of the Church at that time so far as forms of good and truth are concerned is not going to be visible to anyone either on earth or in heaven, 
for 'day' and 'hour' in this case are not used to mean day and hour, that is, a period of time, but a state so far as good and truth are concerned. Periods of time in the Word mean states, see <a href="2625.htm">2625</a>, <a href="2788.htm">2788</a>, <a href="2837.htm">2837</a>, <a href="3254.htm">3254</a>, <a href="3356.htm">3356</a>, and 'day' also has the same meaning, <a href="23.htm">23</a>, <a href="487.htm">487</a>, <a href="488.htm">488</a>, <a href="493.htm">493</a>, <a href="893.htm">893</a>, <a href="2788.htm">2788</a>, <a href="3462.htm">3462</a>, <a href="3785.htm">3785</a>. 'Hour.' too therefore is descriptive of state, but some specific aspect The reason why state so 
far as good and truth are concerned is meant is that the subject is the Church, for good and truth constitute the Church. </p>
<p></p>
<p><b>[2]</b>
 Not even the angels of heaven, but My Father only means that heaven does 
not know the specific nature of the state of the Church so far as good and truth are concerned; the Lord alone knows. Nor does it know when that state of the Church is going to be reached. The Lord 
Himself is meant by 'the Father', see <a href="15.htm">15</a>, <a href="1729.htm">1729</a>, <a href="2004.htm">2004</a>, <a href="2005.htm">2005</a>, <a href="3690.htm">3690</a>; also the Divine Good within the Lord is called 'the Father' and the Divine Truth originating in Divine Good is called 'the Son', see <a href="2803.htm">2803</a>, 
<a href="3703.htm">3703</a>, <a href="3704.htm">3704</a>, <a href="3736.htm">3736</a>. People therefore who believe that the Father is one and the Son another, and who keep the two apart, do not understand the Scriptures. </p>
<p></p>
<p><b>[3]</b>
 But as they were in the days before 
the Flood means the state of vastation undergone by those who belonged to the Church. This state is compared to the state of vastation which the first or Most Ancient Church underwent, the close of their 
age, that is, their last judgement, being described in the Word by means of the Flood. For 'the Flood' means a deluge of evils and falsities and the close of that age which followed as a result, 
see <a href="310.htm">310</a>, <a href="660.htm">660</a>, <a href="662.htm">662</a>, <a href="705.htm">705</a>, <a href="739.htm">739</a>, <a href="790.htm">790</a>, <a href="805.htm">805</a>, <a href="1120.htm">1120</a>; and 'days' means states, see above. </p>
<p></p>
<p><b>[4]</b>
 Eating and drinking, marrying and giving in marriage means their state insofar as they made evil and falsity their 
own, and by doing this became joined to these. For 'eating' means making good one's own, and 'drinking' making truth one's own, see <a href="3168.htm">3168</a>, <a href="3513.htm">3513</a> (end), <a href="3596.htm">3596</a>; and so in the contrary sense they mean making 
evil and falsity one's own. 'Marrying' means becoming joined to evil and 'giving in marriage' becoming joined to falsity, as may be seen from what has been stated and shown about marriage and conjugial 
love in <a href="686.htm">686</a>, <a href="2173.htm">2173</a>, <a href="2618.htm">2618</a>, <a href="2728.htm">2728</a>, <a href="2729.htm">2729</a>, <a href="2737.htm">2737</a>-<a href="2739.htm">2739</a>, <a href="2803.htm">2803</a>, <a href="3132.htm">3132</a>, <a href="3155.htm">3155</a>, to the effect that in the internal sense the joining together of good and truth is meant by them, though here in the contrary sense 
the joining together of evil and falsity is meant. Everything the Lord has said, since it is Divine, is of a different nature in the internal sense from what it is in the letter. So eating and drinking 
in the Holy Supper do not in the spiritual sense mean eating and drinking but making the good of the Lord's Divine love one's own, <a href="2165.htm">2165</a>, <a href="2177.htm">2177</a>, <a href="2187.htm">2187</a>, <a href="2343.htm">2343</a>, <a href="2359.htm">2359</a>, <a href="3464.htm">3464</a>, <a href="3478.htm">3478</a>, <a href="3735.htm">3735</a>, <a href="4211.htm">4211</a>, <a href="4217.htm">4217</a>. And 
as the joining of good which is the good of love to truth which is the truth of faith is meant when the idea of a marriage is used in reference to the Church or to the Lord's kingdom, so therefore is 
the Lord's kingdom in the Word called the heavenly marriage </p>
<p></p>
<p><b>[5]</b>
 Up to the day on which Noah entered the ark means the end of the former Church and the beginning of the new one, for 'Noah' means the 
Ancient Church in general which replaced the Most Ancient after the Flood, <a href="773.htm">773</a> and elsewhere, while 'the ark' means the Church itself, <a href="639.htm">639</a>. The word 'day' which is used several times in these verses 
means state, as shown just above. </p>
<p></p>
<p><b>[6]</b>
 And they were unaware of anything until the flood came and took them all away means that members of the Church at that time will not know that they have been 
swamped by evils and falsities because, on account of the evils and falsities in which they are immersed, they will have no knowledge of what the good of love to the Lord is and what the good of charity 
towards the neighbour is, nor also what the truth of faith is. Nor will they know that such truth originates in those forms of good and that it cannot exist except with people who lead lives filled 
with such love and charity, in addition to which they will have no knowledge of the fact that what is internal saves or condemns, not what is external separated from internal. </p>
<p></p>
<p><b>[7]</b>
 So also will be 
the coming of the Son of Man means Divine Truth which they will not entertain. The meaning of 'the coming of the Son of Man' as Divine Truth which will be revealed at that time has been discussed already 
at verses 27-30, and in <a href="2803.htm">2803</a>, <a href="2813.htm">2813</a>, <a href="3704.htm">3704</a>, as well as <a href="3004.htm">3004</a>-<a href="3006.htm">3006</a>, <a href="3008.htm">3008</a>, <a href="3009.htm">3009</a>. </p>
<p></p>
<p><b>[8]</b>
 At that time two will be in the field; one will be taken and one will be left behind means those within the Church 
who are governed by good and those within the Church who are governed by evil; the former will be saved and the latter condemned. For 'the field' means the Church as regards good, see <a href="2971.htm">2971</a>, <a href="3196.htm">3196</a>, <a href="3310.htm">3310</a>, 
<a href="3317.htm">3317</a>, <a href="3766.htm">3766</a>. </p>
<p></p>
<p><b>[9]</b>
 Two women grinding at the mill; one will be taken and one will be left behind means the future salvation of those within the Church who know the truth, that is, who are led by 
good to have an affection for it, and the future condemnation of those within the Church who know the truth, but who are led by evil to have an affection for it. These meanings which 'grinding' and 'mill' 
have in the Word will be clear from what appears immediately below. </p>
<p>From all this it is now evident that the words under consideration describe what the state of good and truth will be like within 
the Church when that Church is set aside and the new one is adopted. </p>

De die autem illa et hora nemo scit significat statum Ecclesiae tunc quoad bona et vera, quod non appariturus alicui nec in terra nec in caelo; per `diem' enim et `horam' hic non intelligitur dies

credunt quod alius sit Pater et alius Filius, et qui distinguunt illos, non intelligunt scripturas.  [3] Quemadmodum autem {1} erant in diebus ante diluvium significat statum vastationis eorum 
qui ab Ecclesia, qui comparatur cum statum vastationis primae (o)seu Antiquissimae Ecclesiae, cujus consummatio saeculi seu ultimum judicium describitur in Verbo per diluvium; quod per `diluvium'

de conjugio et {5} amore conjugiali n. 686, 2173, 2618, 2728, 2729, 2737-2739, 2803, 3132, 3155 dicta et ostensa sunt, quod nempe in sensu interno sit conjunctio boni et veri, hic autem in opposito 
sensu est conjunctio mali et falsi.  Quicquid Dominus locutus est, quia Divinum, non tale est in sensu interno quale in littera, sicut edere et bibere in Sancta Cena non significat (o)in sensu spirituali 
edere et bibere, sed appropriari bono Divini amoris Domini, n. 2165, 2177, 2187, 2343, 2359, 3464, 3478, 3735, 4211, 4217; et sicut conjugiale cum praedicatur de Ecclesia et de regno Domini, 
est conjunctio boni quod est amoris cum vero quod est fidei, ideo ex illa regnum Domini in Verbo vocatur conjugium caeleste.  [5] Usque quo die intravit Noe in arcam significat finem prioris Ecclesiae 
et initium novae; per `Noahum' enim significatur Antiqua Ecclesia in genere quae successit Antiquissimae post diluvium, n. 773 et alibi et per `arcam' ipsa Ecclesia, n. 639: `dies' qui aliquoties 
in his versibus nominatur, significat statum, ut mox supra ostensum.  [6] Et non cognoverunt donec veniret diluvium, et tolleret omnes significat quod homines Ecclesiae tunc non scient quod inundati sint 
malis et falsis, quia propter mala et falsa in quibus sunt, ignoraturi quid bonum amoris in Dominum et bonum charitatis erga proximum, tum quid verum fidei; et quod hoc sit inde, et non 
dabile quam apud (c)eos qui in amore illo et in charitate illa vivunt {6}; </p>
<p>etiam ignoraturi quod internum sit quod salvat et damnat, non autem externum separatum ab interno.  [7] Sic erit adventus 
Filii hominis significat Divinum Verum quod non acceptaturi; quod `adventus Filii hominis' sit Divinum Verum quod tunc revelabitur, prius ad versum 27 et 30 dictum est, et n. 2803, 2813, 3704, tum 
3004-3006, 3008, 3009.  [8] Tunc duo erunt in agro, unus assumetur, et unus derelinquetur significat illos qui intra Ecclesiam sunt in bono et qui intra Ecclesiam in malo, quod qui in bono, salvabuntur 
et qui in malo, damnabuntur; quod `ager' sit Ecclesia quoad bonum, videatur n. 2971, 3196, 3310, 3317, 3766. Duae molentes in mola, una assumetur, et una derelinquetur significat illos qui sunt 
intra Ecclesiam in vero, hoc est, in affectione ejus ex bono, quod salvabuntur, et qua intra Ecclesiam in vero, hoc est, in affectione ejus ex malo, quod damnabuntur; quod `molere et mola' in Verbo 
illa significent, constabit ex nunc sequentibus.  Ex his nunc patet quod per illa verba describatur qualis status futurus quoad bonum et verum intra Ecclesiam, quando illa rejicitur et nova adoptatur.
