<h3 align="center" class="ired">属天的奥秘 第565节</h3>
<h4 align="center"></h4><p><strong>565.</strong>“人”表那时的人类，尤指邪恶或堕落的种族。这一点从随后的经文清楚可知：<br />人既属乎血肉，我的灵就不永远责备他（3节）；人在地上的罪恶增多，终日所思想的尽都是恶（5节）；我要从土地上除灭我造的人（7节）。<br />以及下一章：<br />凡爬在地上有血肉的都死了；凡鼻孔有灵生命气息的人也都死了。（创世记<a href="http://39-27.cn/创7.21.htm">7:21</a>-<a href="http://39-27.cn/创7.22.htm">22</a>）<br />至于人，前文已说明，唯独主是人，每个属天之人或属天教会都凭着祂而被称为人。因此，所有其它教会被称为人，每个人也被称为人，无论信仰如何，从而将人与兽区分开。但除非凭借主的余留，否则人仍不是人，与兽无异。事实上，人之所以被称为人就在于余留；即便最邪恶的人也能凭主的余留获得人的称谓。若没有余留，人决不是人，完全就是野兽。</p>

<p><strong>[NCE]565.</strong> The symbolism of humankind as the human race of that time — an evil and corrupt race — is established by subsequent verses:<br />My spirit will not denounce humankind forever, because they are flesh. (<a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_565/bible_king-james-version_genesis_6_3" target=_top>Genesis 6:3</a>)<br />The evil of the people in the land multiplied; and everything that the thoughts of their heart fabricated was nothing but evil. (<a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_565/bible_king-james-version_genesis_6_5" target=_top>Genesis 6:5</a>)<br />I will obliterate the human whom I created. (<a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_565/bible_king-james-version_genesis_6_7" target=_top>Genesis 6:7</a>)<br />And from the next chapter:<br />All flesh creeping on the earth passed away, and every human, in whose nostrils was the breath of living spirit. (<a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_565/bible_king-james-version_genesis_7_21-22" target=_top>Genesis 7:21-22</a>)<br />In regard to humanity, it has already been said that the Lord alone is human [<a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_565/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_49" target=_top>49</a>, <a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_565/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_162" target=_top>162</a>] and that from him every heavenly person (or heavenly church) acquires the name of human [<a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_565/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_477" target=_top>477</a>]. Everyone who is not heavenly acquires the name of human from him too, as do people of all religions whatever. It is what distinguishes us from animals. Still, we are not human, are not different from the animals, except through having a remnant (as noted [<a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_565/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_530" target=_top>530</a>, <a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_565/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_560" target=_top>560</a>]), which is the Lord's. The remnant too enables us to be called human, and since the remnant enables this, and the remnant is the Lord's, again it is from the Lord that we acquire the name of human, no matter how bad we are. We would not be human but the lowest of the animals if we had no remnant. </p>

That by "man" is here signified the race of mankind existing at that time, and indeed a race which was evil or corrupt, appears from the following passages: "My spirit shall not reprove man forever, 
for that he is flesh" (verse 3). "The evil of man was multiplied on the earth, and the imagination of the thoughts of his heart was only evil" (verse 5). "I will destroy man whom I have created" (verse 
7); and in the following chapter (Gen. 7:21-22), "All flesh died that crept upon the earth, and every man, in whose nostrils was the breath of the spirit of lives." Of man it has already been said that 
the Lord alone is Man, and that from Him every celestial man, or celestial church, is called "man."  Hence all of other churches are called men; and so is everyone, no matter of what faith, to distinguish 
him from the brutes. But still a man is not a man, and distinct from the brutes, except by virtue of remains, which are of the Lord. From these also a man is called man, and inasmuch as he is 
so called by reason of remains, which belong to the Lord, it is from Him that he has the name of man be he ever so wicked, for a man is by no means man, but the vilest of brutes, unless he has remains. </p>

'Man' here means the human race at that period of time, in particular the race that was evil or corrupt. This becomes clear from the following verses,  </p>
<blockquote>
My spirit will not reprove man for ever, in 
that he is flesh, verse 3;  The evil of man had been increased on the earth; and all the imagination of the thoughts of his heart was altogether evil, verse 5;
</blockquote>
<p>I will wipe out man whom I have created, 
verse 7;    and in the next chapter, </p>
<blockquote>
All flesh creeping over the earth breathed its last; and every man, in whose nostrils was the breath of the spirit of life.<A name="fntext1"></a><A href="#fn1"><sup>a</sup></a> <a href="http://bible.gospelcom.net/cgi-bin/bible?passage=Gen%207:21,%2022&amp;version=ESV&amp;interface=print&amp;showfn=yes&amp;showxref">Gen 7:21, 22</a>.  
</blockquote>
<p>Concerning 
man it has been stated already that the Lord alone is Man, and that by virtue of Him every celestial man or celestial Church is called man, as is every other man or Church. And the same applies also to 
every individual, of whatever faith, to distinguish him from animals. But nobody is man or different from animals except, as has been stated, by virtue of remnants, which are the Lord's. Indeed remnants 
are what enable anyone to be called man; for it is on account of remnants which are the Lord's and so are obtained from Him that even the worst human being is called a man. For without remnants a 
person is in no sense a man but an utter beast.

Quod per 'hominem' significetur hic genus humanum tunc temporis, et quidem malum seu corruptum, constare potest a sequentibus: 'Non arguet spiritus Meus hominem in perpetuum, eo quod ille caro,' vers. 
3, 'quod multiplicatum malum hominis in terra, et omne figmentum cogitationum cordis ejus solummodo malum,' vers. 5, 'delebo hominem, quem creavi,' vers. 7, et cap. seq. vers. 21, 22, 'Exspiravit omnis 
caro repens super terra,... et omnis homo, in cujus naribus {x}flatus spiritus vitarum'. De homine prius dictum quod Dominus solus Homo, et quod ab Ipso omnis caelestis homo seu caelestis Ecclesia 
vocatur homo; inde reliqui; tum quoque omnis cujuscumque fidei ad distinguendum eum a brutis; sed homo non est homo et distinctus a brutis, nisi per reliquias, ut dictum, quae sunt Domini; inde quoque 
homo vocatur homo, et quia propter reliquias quae sunt Domini, ita quoque a Domino, etiamsi pessimus; nam homo nusquam est homo sed vilissimum brutorum si non ei reliquiae. </p>
