<h3 align="center" class="ired">属天的奥秘 第5264节</h3>
<h4 align="center"></h4><p><strong>5264.</strong>“神已将所要作的事指示法老了”表属世层被允许觉察所提供的事。这从“神所要作的事”和“指示”的含义，以及“法老”的代表清楚可知：“神所要作的事”是指所提供的事，如下文所述；“指示”是指交流并让人去觉察（参看<a href="3608.htm">3608</a>，<a href="4856.htm">4856</a>节）；“法老”是指属世层（<a href="5263.htm">5263</a>节）。由此明显可知，“神已将所要作的事指示法老了”表示属世层被允许觉察所提供的事。<br />“神所要作的事”之所以是所提供的事，是因为神，即主所作的一切事都是祂的提供。提供的每个行为都是神性，因它含有永恒和无限之物在里面。它含有永恒之物，是因为它的关注点不受任何起始或终结的限制；它含有无限之物，是因为它同时关注每个具体部分里面的整个整体，以及整个整体里面的每个具体部分。这一切被称为“提供”；由于主所作的每一件事都含有永恒和无限之物在里面，所以祂的行为不能用其它任何词，只能用“提供”来描述。主所作的每一件事都含有无限和永恒之物在里面，蒙主的神性怜悯，这一真理将在别处举例来说明。</p>

<p align="center"><b>Potts(1905-1910) 5264</b></p><p><b>5264.</b>
What God doeth He hath shown to Pharaoh. That this signifies what was provided, that it was given the natural to perceive, is evident from the signification of "what God doeth," as being what is provided 
(of which in what follows); from the signification of "showing," as being to communicate and give to perceive (see n. 3608, 4856); and from the representation of Pharaoh, as being the natural (n. 
5263). From this it is plain that by, "what God doeth He hath shown to Pharaoh," is signified what was provided, that it was given the natural to perceive. That "what God doeth" is what is provided, 
is because everything that God (that is, the Lord) does, is providence, which being from the Divine has within it what is eternal and infinite-what is eternal, because it does not look to any terminus 
from which, nor to any terminus to which, it proceeds; and what is infinite, because it simultaneously regards what is infinite in every singular, and every singular in what is universal. This is called 
"providence;" and because there is such a quality in each and all things the Lord does, therefore His doing cannot be expressed by any other word than "providence." That in each and all things the 
Lord does there is what is infinite and eternal, will of the Lord's Divine mercy be elsewhere illustrated by examples. </p>

<p align="center"><b>Elliott(1983-1999) 5264</b></p><p><b>5264.</b>
'What God is doing He has pointed out to Pharaoh' means that the natural was allowed to discern what was provided. This is clear from the meaning of 'what God is doing' as what was provided, dealt with 
below; from the meaning of 'pointing out' as communicating and allowing one to discern, dealt with in <a href="3608.htm">3608</a>, <a href="4856.htm">4856</a>; and from the representation of 'Pharaoh' as the natural, dealt with above in <a href="5263.htm">5263</a>. 
From this it is evident that 'what God is doing He has pointed out to Pharaoh' means that the natural was allowed to discern what was provided. </p>
<p></p>
<p><b>[2]</b>
 The reason why 'what God is doing' means what has 
been provided is that everything done by God, that is, by the Lord, constitutes His Providence. Every act of Providence is Divine, for it holds what is eternal and infinite within it. It holds what is 
eternal because its view is not limited by any beginning or end, and it holds what is infinite because its view comprehends simultaneously the entire whole within any specific part, and every specific 
part within the entire whole. All this is called 'Providence'; and because every single one of the Lord's acts holds what is eternal and infinite within it, no other expression than Providence exists 
to describe it. This truth that every single one of the Lord's acts holds what is infinite and eternal within it will in the Lord's Divine mercy be illustrated elsewhere with the help of examples. </p>

</p><b>5264.</b>
`Quod Deus faciens indicavit Pharaoni': quod significet quid provisum, quod appercipere datum naturali, constat ex significatione `quod Deus faciens' quod sit provisum, de qua sequitur; ex significatione 
`indicare' quod sit communicare et dare appercipere, de qua n. 3608, 4856; et ex repraesentatione `Pharaonis' quod sit naturale, de qua {1}supra n. 5263; inde patet quod per `quod Deus faciens indicavit 
Pharaoni' significetur quid provisum, quod appercipere datum naturali. [2] `Quod Deus faciens' quod sit provisum, {2}est quia omne quod Deus, hoc est, Dominus facit, est Providentia, quod enim 
Providentiae est, Divinum est, nam hoc in se Aeternum et Infinitum habet; aeternum quia non spectat aliquem terminum a quo, nec terminum ad quem; infinitum quia spectat simul in omni singulari universale, 
et in universali omne singulare; hoc vocatur Providentia; et quia in omnibus et singulis quae Dominus facit, tale inest, ideo Ipsius `facere' non per aliam vocem quam per vocem Providentiae, exprimi 
potest.  Quod in omnibus et singulis quae Dominus facit, insit infinitum et aeternum, per exempla alibi, ex Divina Domini Misericordia, illustrabitur.  @1 i mox$ @2 As A; I has hoc est, Dominus 
facit, est Providentia, quae qui est ex Divino, in se habeat, est quia omne, quod Deus, Aeternum et Infinitum.$ </p>
