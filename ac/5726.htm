<h3 align="center" class="ired">属天的奥秘 第5726节</h3>
<h4 align="center"></h4><p><strong>5726.</strong>由于死亡完全是由于罪，而非来自其它源头，而罪就在于违反神性次序的一切，所以邪恶会关闭最细小、完全看不见的血管；而紧接着也看不见的更大一点的血管是由这最细小的血管构成的。因为最细小、完全看不见的血管会延伸到人的内层。这就是最初和至内在的堵塞发展的地方，也是最初和至内在的损伤进入血液的地方。当这种损伤增长时，它会造成疾病，最终造成死亡。然而，如果人过着良善的生活，那么他的内层就会向天堂打开，并通过天堂向主打开；最细节、完全看不见的小血管也是如此（第一缕脉络的痕迹凭对应可称作小血管）。若是这样的话，人就不会有病，只是在他接近极为老迈的年纪时才会变得衰弱，直到他再次变成小孩子，不过现在是充满智慧的小孩子。当他的身体无法再服侍他的内在人或灵时，他就会在没有疾病的情况下从他的尘世身体进入天使所拥有的那种身体，因而直接从世界进入天堂。</p>

<p align="center"><b>Potts(1905-1910) 5726</b></p><p><b>5726.</b>
As death is from no other source than sin, and sin is all that which is contrary to Divine order, therefore evil closes the very smallest and most invisible vessels, of which are composed the next larger 
ones, also invisible; for the vessels which are smallest of all and wholly invisible are continued from man's interiors. Hence comes the first and inmost obstruction, and hence the first and inmost 
vitiation into the blood. When this vitiation increases, it causes disease, and finally death. If, however, man had lived a life of good, his interiors would be open into heaven, and through heaven 
to the Lord; and so too would the very least and most invisible little vessels (the traces of the first threads may be called little vessels, on account of the correspondence). In consequence man would 
be without disease, and would merely decline to extreme old age, even until he became again a little child, but a wise one; and when the body could no longer minister to his internal man or spirit, 
he would pass without disease out of his earthly body into a body such as the angels have, thus out of the world directly into heaven. </p>

<p align="center"><b>Elliott(1983-1999) 5726</b></p><p><b>5726.</b>
Since death is due entirely to sin, and sin consists in everything contrary to Divine order, evil therefore closes the tiniest and completely invisible blood vessels out of which the immediately larger, 
yet also invisible, vessels are constructed. For the tiniest and completely invisible vessels extend into a person's interiors. This is where the first and innermost obstruction develops and where 
the first and innermost impairment enters the blood. As this impairment grows it causes sickness, and at length death. But if it were the case that the person was leading a good life his interiors would 
lie open into heaven, and through heaven towards the Lord, and so too would his tiniest invisible vascula (the mere traces of first threads may by virtue of correspondence be called vascula). If this 
were so man would not know any sickness and would grow weak only as he approached extreme old age, until he became a young child again, but now a young child with wisdom. And when his body was no 
longer able to serve his internal man, which is his spirit, he would pass, without knowing any sickness, from his earthly body into a body such as angels possess, and so would pass from the world directly 
into heaven. </p>

</p><b>5726.</b>
Quia mors non aliunde est quam ex peccato, et peccatum est omne id quod est contra ordinem Divinum, inde est quod malum claudat omnium minima et prorsus invisibilia vasa, a quibus proxime majora etiam 
invisibilia, {1}contexta sunt; vasa enim omnium minima et prorsus invisibilia continuantur interioribus hominis; inde prima et intima obstructio, et inde primum et intimum vitium in sanguinem; hoc 
vitium cum accrescit, causatur morbum, et tandem mortem.  Si autem homo vixisset vitam boni, tunc interiora ejus aperta in caelum, et per caelum ad Dominum forent, ita quoque omnium minima et {2}invisibilia 
vascula (delineamenta primorum staminum licet vascula appellare, ob correspondentiam); inde homo absque morbo foret, et solum decresceret ad ultimum senium, usque dum fieret rursus infans, sed 
infans sapiens; et cum tunc corpus non amplius ministrare posset interno ejus homini, seu spiritui, transiret absque morbo e corpore suo terrestri in corpus quale habent angeli, ita e mundo immediate 
in caelum. @1 contenta I$ @2 i prorsus$ </p>
