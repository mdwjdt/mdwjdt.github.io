<h3 align="center" class="ired">属天的奥秘 第142节</h3>
<h4 align="center"></h4><p><strong>142.</strong>创世记2:19-20 耶和华神用土所造成的田间各样走兽和空中各样飞鸟都带到那人面前，看他叫什么。那人怎样叫各样的活物，那就是它的名字。那人便给一切牲畜和空中飞鸟、田间走兽都起了名，只是那人没有遇见一个看似属于他的帮手。<br />“牲畜”表属天的情感，“天上的飞鸟”表属灵的情感，换言之，“牲畜”与意志相关，“飞鸟”与觉性相关。“带到那人面前，看他叫什么”，表示使他明了它们的属性，“起了名”则表示已经明了。只是，主虽赐予他们本能，使他们能了解良善之情和真理之知，他们却依然渴望自我，此处以同样的语句来描述——他没有遇见“一个看似属于他的帮手”。</p>

<p><strong>[NCE]142.</strong> <a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_142/bible_king-james-version_genesis_2_19-20" target=_top>Genesis 2:19-20</a>. And out of the soil Jehovah God formed every animal of the field and every bird in the heavens and brought it to the human to see what he would call it. And whatever the human called the living soul, that was its name. And the human gave names to every beast and to the bird in the heavens and to every wild animal of the field; but for the human no aid was found that seemed to be his.<br />Animals symbolize emotions of a heavenly type; birds in the heavens symbolize emotions of a spiritual type. To put it another way, animals symbolize the contents of the will, birds the contents of the intellect. Bringing them to the human to see, so that he could call them by name, means granting humankind the ability to recognize the nature of those feelings; the fact that he gave them names means that people recognized the nature of the feelings. At the same time, even though they recognized the nature of the virtuous emotions and true concepts given them as gifts by the Lord, they still strove for autonomy, as expressed in the same words used before: he did not find an aid that seemed to be his. </p>

Verses 19, 20. And Jehovah God formed out of the ground every beast of the field, and every fowl of the heavens, and brought it to the man to see what he would call it; and whatsoever the man called 
every living soul, that was the name thereof. And the man gave names to every beast, and to the fowl of the heavens, and to every wild animal of the field; but for the man there was not found a help as 
with him. By "beasts" are signified celestial affections, and by "fowls of the heavens" spiritual affections; that is to say, by "beasts" are signified things of the will, and by "fowls" things of the 
understanding. To "bring them to the man to see what he would call them" is to enable him to know their quality, and his "giving them names" signifies that he knew it. But notwithstanding that he knew 
the quality of the affections of good and of the knowledges of truth that were given him by the Lord, still he inclined to his Own, which is expressed in the same terms as before-that "there was not 
found a help as with him." </p>

for good and the cognitions of truth which the Lord had granted him, he still set his heart on the proprium, which is expressed in the same way as before - 'there was not found a help suitable

Vers. 19, 20.  Et formavit Jehovah Deus ex humo omnem bestiam agri, et omnem avem caelorum, et adduxit ad hominem ad videndum quid vocaret id; et quicquid vocabat id homo, animam viventem, id nomen 
ejus. Et vocabat homo nomina omni bestiae, et avi caelorum, et omni ferae agri; et homini non invenit auxilium tanquam apud illum. Per 'bestias' significantur caelestes affectiones; per 'aves caelorum' 
spirituales; seu per 'bestias,' quae sunt voluntatis, per 'aves,' quae sunt intellectus: 'adducere ad hominem ad videndum ut vocaret nomine' est dare ei nosse quales sunt; 'quodque vocaverit nomina' 
est quod cognoverit quales essent: et tametsi noverit quales affectiones boni et cognitiones veri a Domino donatae, essent, usque affectabat proprium, quod exprimitur per idem ac prius, quod 'non invenerit 
auxilium tanquam apud illum.'
