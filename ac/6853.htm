<h3 align="center" class="ired">属天的奥秘 第6853节</h3>
<h4 align="center"></h4><p><strong>6853.</strong>“我原知道他们的痛苦”表对他们陷入虚假何等之深的预见。这从“知道”和“痛苦”的含义清楚可知：“知道”当论及主时，是指预见（“知道”之所以表示预见，是因为主自永恒就知道每一个事物）；“痛苦”是指陷入虚假。因为当处于良善的人陷入虚假时，他们就会感到痛苦和焦虑，备受折磨；因为他们热爱真理，厌恶虚假，时时刻刻都在思想得救，思想如果虚假战胜他们，他们将何等不幸。但那些未处于良善的人不关心是虚假在他们身上掌权，还是真理在他们身上掌权；他们根本不思想得救，或不幸，因为他们不信这些事。爱自己爱世界的快乐夺走了关于死后生命的一切信仰。这些人总是沉浸于虚假。在来世，沉浸于虚假看似海浪吞没一个人，并且随着虚假增多而越冲越高，赶到最后它们漫过他的头顶；这些浪头也照着虚假的性质而显得更稀或更密。对恶人来说，沉浸于虚假看似一种多多少少阴暗的雾或云，笼罩着他们，使他们与天堂之光的明净完全隔绝。</p>

For I have known their sorrows. That this signifies foresight in regard to how much they would be immersed in falsities, is evident from the signification of "knowing," when said of the Lord, as being 
foresight (that "to know" denotes foresight is because the Lord knows each and all things from eternity); and from the signification of "sorrows," as being immersion in falsities; for when they who 
are in good are immersed in falsities, they come into anguish and anxieties, and are tormented; for they love truths and abhor falsities, and constantly think about salvation, and about their unhappiness 
if falsities should rule with them. But they who are not in good, care not whether they are in falsities or in truths, for they do not think at all about salvation, or about unhappiness, because they 
do not believe in these things. The delights of the loves of self and of the world take away all belief about the life after death. These persons are perpetually immersed in falsities. Immersion in 
falsities appears in the other life like one who is immersed in waves, which according to the abundance of falsities rise higher and higher, until at last they rise over his head; the waves appearing 
thinner or denser according to the quality of the falsities. With the wicked the immersion appears as a mistiness and as a cloudiness more or less dusky, which compasses them about, and quite separates 
them from the serenity of the light of heaven. </p>

<p align="center"><b>Elliott(1983-1999) 6853</b></p><p><b>6853.</b>
'For I know their sorrows' means foresight of how deeply they would be plunged into falsities. This is clear from the meaning of 'knowing', when used in reference to the Lord, as foresight (the reason 
why 'knowing' is foresight is that the Lord has known from eternity about every single thing); and from the meaning of 'sorrows' as being plunged into falsities. For when people who are governed by 
good are plunged into falsities they experience feelings of anguish and anxiety. They suffer torment, for they love truths and loathe falsities, and are thinking all the time about salvation and about 
how unhappy they will be if those falsities get the better of them. But those who are not governed by good are completely unconcerned about whether falsities or truths reign in them; for they do not 
think at all about salvation and unhappiness since they do not believe there are any such things. The delights of self-love and love of the world take away any firm belief regarding life after death. 
These people are immersed all the time in falsities. Being plunged into falsities is presented in the next life as waves engulfing a person and rising ever higher as the falsities grow more profuse, until 
the waves rise over his head; and they appear tenuous or solid according to the nature of the falsities. The experience of being plunged into falsities which the wicked undergo looks like a mistiness 
or cloudiness, more or less murky, which surrounds them and cuts them off completely from the brightness of the light of heaven. </p>

`Quia novi dolores illius': quod significet praevidentiam, quantum falsis immersi fuerint, constat ex significatione `nosse' cum dicitur de Domino, quod sit praevidentia; quod `nosse' sit praevidentia, 
(x)est quia Dominus omnia et singula ab aeterno {1}novit; et ex significatione `dolorum' quod sit immersio in falsa; qui enim in bono sunt, cum immerguntur falsis, in {2}angores et anxietates veniunt: 
et cruciantur, amant enim vera et aversantur falsa, et cogitant {3} jugiter de salute et de infelicitate si apud illos falsa dominarentur; qui autem non in bono sunt nihil curant sive in falsis sive 
in veris sint, nihil enim cogitant de salute nec de infelicitate, non enim credunt illa; jucunda amorum sui et mundi auferunt fidem de vita post mortem; (m)hi perpetuo immersi sunt falsis.  Immersio 
in falsa apparet in alter vita sicut qui immersus undis, quae secundum falsorum copiam altius usque tandem supra caput {4}ascendunt, (x)undae apparent tenuiores aut spissiores secundum falsorum quale; 
immersio quae est improbis apparet ut nimbosum ac ut nebulosum magis minusve furvum quod circumcingit, et prorsus separat a sereno quod est lucis caeli {5}.(n) 	1 scit 	2 angorem 	3 i enim 	4 
A is confused; it appears to be elevantur; talis apparet immersio quae fit proborum, sed immersio quae fit improborum est nimbosum et furvum nebuloso 	5 i, in quo illi qui in veris ex bono </p>
