And the dove did not find a resting place for the sole of its foot, and it returned to him, to the ark, because there was water over the face of the whole earth; and he put his hand out and took it and brought it in to himself, into the ark.<br />The dove did not find a resting place for the sole of its foot means that none of faith's goodness or truth could root itself. It returned to him, to the ark, symbolizes goodness and truth that seemed to be religious in those people. Because there was water over the face of the earth means that falsity was still overflowing. He put his hand out symbolizes their personal power. And took it and brought it to himself, into the ark, means that they did good and thought about truth under their own direction. </p>

Verse 9. And the dove found no rest for the sole of her foot, and she returned unto him to the ark, for the waters were on the faces of the whole earth; and he put forth his hand and took her, and brought 
her in unto him into the ark. "And the dove found no rest for the sole of her foot" signifies that nothing of the good and truth of faith could yet take root; "and she returned unto him to the ark" 
signifies good and truth appearing with him as though they were of faith; "for the waters were on the faces of the whole earth" signifies that falsities were still overflowing; "and he put forth his 
hand" signifies his own power; "and took her and brought her in unto him into the ark" signifies that he did what was good and thought what was true from himself. </p>

Verse 9 And the dove found no rest for the sole of its foot, and it returned to him to the ark, for the waters were over the face' of the whole earth. And he put out his hand, and took hold of it, and 
brought it in to himself into the ark. </p>
<p>'The dove found no rest for the sole of its foot' means that no good and truth of faith at all had as yet been able to take root. 'It returned to him to the 
ark' means good and truth appearing to be the good and truth of faith with him. 'For the waters were over the face<A name="fntext1"></a><A href="#fn1"><sup>a</sup></a> of the earth' means that falsities were still there to overflowing. 'He put out his 
hand' means his own power. 'And he took hold of it, and brought it in to himself into the ark' means that self was the source of the good he did and of the truth he thought.

Vers. 9.  Et non invenit columba quietem volae pedis sui, et falsa est ad illum ad arcam, quia aquae super faciebus totius terrae, et emisit manum suam, et accepit illam, et induxit illam ad se in arcam. 
'Quod non invenerit columba quietem volae pedis sui' significat quod nihil boni et veri fidei adhuc potuisset radicem figere: 'quod reversa ad illum ad arcam' significat bonum et verum apparens 
quasi fidei apud eum: 'quia aquae super faciebus terrae' significat falsitates quod adhuc superfluerent: 'emisit manum suam' significat potentiam ejus propriam: 'et accepit illam et adduxit illam ad se 
in arcam' significat quod ex semet bonum faceret et verum cogitaret. </p>
