<h3 align="center" class="ired">属天的奥秘 第1949节</h3>
<h4 align="center"></h4><p><strong>1949.</strong>“他为人必像野驴”表理性真理，这是对它的描述。这从“野驴”的含义清楚可知，“野驴”表理性真理。圣言多次提及马、骑马的、骡和驴，但至今没人知道它们表示智慧、理性和知识。蒙主怜悯，我会在适当的地方充分证实，这些动物及其骑者具有这样的含义。野驴就属这一类，因为这就是生活在荒野的骡子或野外的驴子，它表示人类理性，不过并非作为整体的理性，只是理性真理。理性由善与真组成，即由属于仁的事物和属于信的事物组成。理性真理就是“野驴”所表示的。这就是以实玛利所代表的，也是本节所描述的。<br />谁能相信脱离理性良善的理性真理具有这样的性质？我本人若非通过活生生的经历得到指教，也不知道这一点。无论是说理性真理，还是说具有这种性质理性的这个人，意思都一样。人类理性若是诸如唯独在于真理，哪怕这真理是信之真理，同时不在于仁之善之类的，那么此人完全就是这种秉性。他善于找茬，不留余地，反对所有人，觉得每个人都有错误，并立即预备去指责、严惩和处罚，没有一点同情心，也不迁就别人并努力纠正别人的想法。因为他看待任何事物都是站在真理的角度，而丝毫不站在良善的角度。总之，他是一个刚硬的人。有一样事物能软化他的刚硬，那就是仁之善。因为良善是真理的灵魂，当良善临近并将自身植入在真理中时，真理会变得截然不同，以至于几乎认不出。“以撒”就代表主那源于良善，而非源于脱离良善之真理的理性人。正因如此，以实玛利被逐出，后来住在旷野，他母亲从埃及地给他娶了一个妻子（创世记<a href="http://39-27.cn/创21.9.htm">21:9</a>-<a href="http://39-27.cn/创21.21.htm">21</a>）。所有这些事件都是具有这种理性之人的代表。<br />野驴在圣言的预言部分有所提及，如以赛亚书：<br />因为宫殿必被撇下，多民的城必被离弃；山冈望楼永为洞穴，作野驴所喜乐的，为羊群的草场。（以赛亚书<a href="http://39-27.cn/赛32.14.htm">32:14</a>）<br />这论及智慧的荒废，当真理被荒废时，智慧就被称为“野驴的喜乐”；当良善被荒废时，智慧就被称为“羊群的草场”，所以这理性并不存在。耶利米书：<br />野驴站在山冈上，喘气好像鲸鱼，因为无草，眼目失明。（耶利米书<a href="http://39-27.cn/耶14.6.htm">14:6</a>）<br />这是指干旱，或善与真的缺乏。当人们紧紧抓住空洞的事物，而非真实的事物，也就是真理时，经上就说野驴“喘气”。“眼目失明”表示不明白何为真理。<br />何西阿书：<br />他们投奔亚述，如同独行的野驴。以法莲雇用妓女求爱情。（何西阿书<a href="http://39-27.cn/何8.9.htm">8:9</a>）<br />这说的是以色列或属灵教会。“以法莲”表示它的理解力部分；“投奔亚述”表示推理真理究竟是不是真理；“独行的野驴”表示丧失真理的理性。同一先知书：<br />他在弟兄中就象野驴，必有耶和华的东风从旷野上来。他的泉源必干，他的源头必竭。这风必掳掠他所积蓄的一切宝器。（何西阿书<a href="http://39-27.cn/何13.15.htm">13:15</a>）<br />这论及“以法莲”，“以法莲”表示属灵教会的理解力部分，他的理性“就象野驴”，此处论述了这理性的毁灭。诗篇：<br />耶和华神使水泉成为溪川，流在山间。使田野所有的走兽有水喝，野驴得解其渴。（诗篇<a href="http://39-27.cn/诗104.10.htm">104:10</a>，<a href="http://39-27.cn/诗104.11.htm">11</a>）<br />“水泉”表认知，“田野的走兽”表良善，“野驴”表理性真理。</p>

<p align="center"><b>Potts(1905-1910) 1949</b></p><p><b>1949.</b>
He shall be a wild-ass [onager] man. That this signifies rational truth, which is described, is evident from the signification of "a wild-ass," as being rational truth. In the Word there is frequent 
mention of horses, horsemen, mules, and asses; and as yet no one has known that these signify things of the intellect, of the reason, and of memory-knowledge. That these animals and their riders have 
such a signification will of the Lord's Divine mercy be fully confirmed in the proper places. Of the same class is the "onager," for this is the mule of the wilderness or wild-ass, and it signifies man's 
rational; not however the rational in its whole complex, but only rational truth. The rational consists of good and truth, that is, of things belonging to charity and of things belonging to faith, 
and it is rational truth that is signified by the "wild-ass." This then is what is represented by Ishmael, and is what is described in this verse.  [2] It seems incredible that rational truth when separated 
from good should be of such a character, neither should I have known this to be the case unless I had been instructed by living experience. Whether you say rational truth; or the man whose rational 
is of this kind, amounts to the same. The man whose rational is of such a character that he is solely in truth-even though it be the truth of faith-and who is not at the same time in the good of 
charity, is altogether of such a character. He is a morose man, will bear nothing, is against all, regards everybody as being in falsity, is ready to rebuke, to chastise, and to punish; has no pity, 
and does not apply or adapt himself to others and study to bend their minds; for he looks at everything from truth, and at nothing from good. Hence it is that Ishmael was driven out, and afterwards dwelt 
in the wilderness, and his mother took him a wife out of the land of Egypt (Gen. 21:9-21); all of which things are representative of one who is endowed with such a rational.  [3] Mention is made 
of "wild-asses" in the prophetical parts of the Word, as in Isaiah: </p>
<p>     The palace shall be forsaken, the multitude of the city shall be deserted; the high place and the watchtower shall be for dens, 
even forever a joy of wild-asses, a pasture of flocks (Isa. 32:14); </p>
<p>where the devastation of intellectual things is treated of, which, when laid waste as regards truths, are called "a joy of wild- 
asses;" and when as regards goods, "a pasture of flocks;" so that there is no rational. In Jeremiah: </p>
<p>     The wild-asses stood upon the hills, they snuffed up the wind like whales, their eyes perished 
because there was no herbage (Jer. 14:6); </p>
<p>where the subject treated of is drought, that is, the absence of what is good and true. It is said of the wild-asses that they "snuff up the wind," when empty 
things are seized on instead of real things, which are truths; "their eyes perished" means that there is no apprehension of what truth is.  [4] In Hosea: </p>
<p>     For they have gone up to Assyria, 
a wild-ass alone by himself; Ephraim hath sought loves with a harlot's hire (Hos. 8:9). Here "Israel," or the spiritual church, is treated of; "Ephraim" denotes its intellectual; "going up into Assyria," 
reasoning about truth, as to whether it is truth; the "solitary wild-ass," the rational thus destitute of truths. In the same: </p>
<p>     For he shall be among his brethren as a wild-ass; an east wind 
shall come, the wind of Jehovah coming up from the wilderness; and his spring shall become dry, and his fountain shall be dried up; he shall make a spoil of the treasure of all vessels of desire (Hos. 
13:15), speaking of Ephraim, by whom is signified the intellectual of the spiritual church, whose rational is "as a wild-ass;" and the destruction of which is here treated of. In David: </p>
<p>     Jehovah 
God shall send forth springs into rivers, they shall run among the mountains; they shall supply drink to every beast of the fields; the wild-asses shall quench their thirst (Ps. 104:10, 11). "Springs" 
denote knowledges; the "beasts of the fields," goods; the "wild-asses," the truths of reason. </p>

<p align="center"><b>Elliott(1983-1999) 1949</b></p><p><b>1949.</b>
That 'he will be a wild-ass man' means rational truth, which is described, is clear from the meaning of 'a wild ass' as rational truth. In the Word, horses, horsemen, mules, and asses are mentioned many 
times, but nobody up to now has known that they mean intellectual concepts, rational concepts, and factual knowledge. That these are meant will be abundantly confirmed, in the Lord's Divine mercy, 
in their separate places. Belonging to the same group is the wild-ass, for such is a mule living in the wilderness or an ass in the wild and means man's rational - not the rational in its entirety, but 
only rational truth. The rational is composed of good and of truth, that is, of things belonging to charity and of those belonging to faith. It is rational truth that is meant by a wild ass. This then 
is what Ishmael represents and is described in the present verse. </p>
<p></p>
<p><b>[2]</b>
 How can anyone believe that rational truth separated from rational good is of such a nature? I myself would not have known 
if I had not been taught from actual experience. Whether you refer to it as rational truth or as the person whose rational is of that nature, it amounts to the same thing. The person whose rational is 
such as consists in truth alone, even though this is the truth of faith, and does not at the same time consist in the goad of charity, is altogether such. He is quick to find fault, makes no allowances, 
is against all, regards everyone as being in error, is instantly prepared to rebuke, to chasten, and to punish, shows no pity, does not apply himself and makes no effort to redirect people's thinking; 
for he views everything from the standpoint of truth, and nothing from the standpoint of good. In short, he is a hard man. The one thing to soften his hardness is the good of charity, for good is 
the soul of truth, and when good draws near and implants itself in truth the latter becomes so different that it can hardly be recognized. 'Isaac' represents the Lord's Rational Man which sprang from 
good, not from truth separated from good. So it was that Ishmael was cast out and after that dwelt in the desert, and that his mother took a wife for him from the land of Egypt, <a href="http://bible.gospelcom.net/cgi-bin/bible?passage=Gen%2021:9-21&amp;version=ESV&amp;interface=print&amp;showfn=yes&amp;showxref">Gen 21:9-21</a>, all of 
which events are representative of a person who is endowed with a rational such as that. </p>
<p></p>
<p><b>[3]</b>
 Mention is made of wild asses in the prophetical parts of the Word, as in Isaiah, </p>
<p>The palace will be 
deserted, the multitude of the city forsaken; the hill and the watchtower will become dens, even for ever the joy of wild asses, a pasture of flocks. <a href="http://bible.gospelcom.net/cgi-bin/bible?passage=Isa%2032:14&amp;version=ESV&amp;interface=print&amp;showfn=yes&amp;showxref">Isa 32:14</a>. </p>
<p>This refers to the devastation of intellectual 
concepts - which when devastated of truths are called 'the joy of wild asses' and when devastated of goods 'a pasture of flocks' - so that the rational does not exist. In Jeremiah, </p>
<blockquote>
The 
wild asses stood on the hills, they panted for air like sea-monsters; their eyes failed because there was no herbage. <a href="http://bible.gospelcom.net/cgi-bin/bible?passage=Jer%2014:6&amp;version=ESV&amp;interface=print&amp;showfn=yes&amp;showxref">Jer 14:6</a>. 
</blockquote>
<p>This refers to a drought, or absence of good and truth. Reference is 
made to the wild asses 'panting for air' when people lay hold of inane ideas instead of realities which are truths. 'Their eyes failed' stands for failing to grasp what truth is. </p>
<p></p>
<p><b>[4]</b>
 In Hosea, </p>
<blockquote>
For 
they have gone up to Assyria, a wild ass alone by himself; Ephraim has sought lovers<A name="fntext1"></a><A href="#fn1"><sup>a</sup></a> with a prostitute's hire. <a href="http://bible.gospelcom.net/cgi-bin/bible?passage=Hosea%208:9&amp;version=ESV&amp;interface=print&amp;showfn=yes&amp;showxref">Hosea 8:9</a>. 
</blockquote>
<p>This refers to Israel or the spiritual Church. 'Ephraim' stands for the 
understanding part of it. 'Going up to Assyria' stands for reasoning about whether the truth is indeed the truth. 'A wild ass alone' stands for the rational thus destitute of truths. In the same prophet, </p>
<blockquote>
For 
he will be among his brothers like a wild ass, Jehovah's east wind will come rising up from the desert, and his spring will become dry, and his fountain dried up. It will strip his treasury 
of all precious vessels. <a href="http://bible.gospelcom.net/cgi-bin/bible?passage=Hosea%2013:15&amp;version=ESV&amp;interface=print&amp;showfn=yes&amp;showxref">Hosea 13:15</a>. 
</blockquote>
<p>This refers to 'Ephraim' by whom the understanding part of the spiritual Church is meant, and to the dissolution of the rational which is like 'a wild ass'. 
In David, </p>
<blockquote>
Jehovah God will send forth springs into the rivers; they will go among the mountains. They give drink to every wild beast of the fields; the wild asses quench their thirst. <a href="http://bible.gospelcom.net/cgi-bin/bible?passage=Ps%20104:10,%2011&amp;version=ESV&amp;interface=print&amp;showfn=yes&amp;showxref">Ps 104:10, 11</a>. 
</blockquote>
<p>'Springs' stands for cognitions, 'wild beasts of the fields' for goods, 'the wild asses' for the truths of reason.

`Is erit onager homo': quod significet verum rationale quod describitur, constat ex significatione `onagri' quod sit verum rationale: in Verbo pluries memorantur equi, equites, muli, asini, et nemini 
adhuc notum est quod significent intellectualia, rationalia et scientifica, qui quod illa significent, ex Divina Domini Misericordia, suis locis, multis confirmabitur; ejusdem generis est onager, est 
enim mulus deserti seu asinus silvestris, et significat rationale hominis, non rationale in suo complexu sed modo verum rationale: rationale consistit (c)a bono et vero, hoc est, ex illis quae sunt 
charitatis et ex illis quae sunt fidei; rationale verum est id quod per `onagrum' significatur; hoc nunc est quod per `Ismaelem' repraesentatur et {1}describitur in hoc versu.  [2] Nemo credere potest 
quod verum rationale separatum a bono rationali, tale sit, nec scivissem quod tale, nisi per vivam experientiam instructus; sive dicas verum rationale, sive hominem cujus rationale tale est, idem est: 
homo cujus rationale tale est ut solum in vero sit, etiamsi in vero fidei, non simul in bono charitatis, est prorsus talis; est vir morosus, nihil patiens, contra omnes, unumquemvis videns sicut in 
falso, ilico increpans, castigans, puniens, non miseretur, non se applicat et studet flectere animos, nam ex vero spectat omne, et nihil ex bono; verbo est durus homo: unice quod emollit duritiem ejus, 
est bonum quod est charitatis nam anima veri est bonum, quod cum accedit et insinuat se vero, fit aliud ut vix cognoscatur.  Per `Isacum' repraesentatur Rationalis Homo Domini, qui ex bono, non ex vero 
separato a bono.  Inde est quod Ismael expulsus, et dein habitavit in deserto, et mater ei uxorem accepit e terra Aegypti, Gen. xxi 9-21, quae omnia sunt repraesentativa {2}tali rationali praediti. 
 [3] Onagrorum mentio fit in propheticis Verbi, ut apud Esaiam, Palatium erit desertum, multitudo urbis derelicta, clivus et specula erit pro speluncis, usque in saeculum gaudium onagrorum, pascuum 
gregum, xxxii 14; </p>
<p>ubi de vastatione intellectualium quae cum vastata quoad vera, vocantur `gaudium onagrorum,' et quoad bona `pascuum gregum,' ita ut non rationale: apud Jeremiam, Onagri steterunt 
super collibus, sorbuerunt ventum sicut ceti, consumpti sunt oculi eorum, quia non herba, xiv 6; </p>
<p>ubi de siccitate seu non bono et vero: de onagris praedicatur quod `sorbeant ventum' cum inania captantur 
loco realium quae sunt vera; `consumpti oculi' pro quod verum quid sit, non capiatur: [4] apud Hosheam, 	Quia illi ascenderunt Assyriam, onager solitarius sibi, Ephraim mercede meretricia expetiverunt 
amores, viii 9; </p>
<p>ibi de Israele seu Ecclesia spirituali: `Ephraim' pro intellectuali ejus; `ascendere Assyriam' pro ratiocinari de vero num veram; `onager solitarius' pro rationali sic destituto 
veris: apud eundem, 	Quia ille inter fratres sicut onager erit, veniet orientalis ventus Jehovae a deserto ascendens, et exarescet scaturigo ejus, et exsiccabitur fons ejus; ille depraedabitur thesaurum 
omnium vasorum desiderii, xiii 15; </p>
<p>ubi de `Ephraim' per quem intellectuale Ecclesiae spiritualis significatur, cujus rationale sicut `onager,' de cujus dissipatione agitur: apud Davidem, Jehovah 
Deus emittet fontes in fluvios, inter montes ibunt, potum praebent omni ferae agrorum, frangunt onagri sitim suam, Psalm civ 10, 11; </p>
<p>`fontes' pro cognitionibus; `ferae agrorum {3}' pro bonis; `onagri' 
pro veris rationis. @1 i quod.$ @2 i hominis.$ @3 agri.$ </p>
