<h3 align="center" class="ired">属天的奥秘 第6376节</h3>
<h4 align="center"></h4><p><strong>6376.</strong>“把母驴的崽子拴在上好的葡萄树上”表对内在教会来说，（通过）来自理性层的真理。这从“葡萄树”和“母驴的崽子”的含义清楚可知：“葡萄树”是指属灵教会（参看<a href="1069.htm">1069</a>，<a href="5113.htm">5113</a>节），因此，“上好的葡萄树”是指内在教会，因为教会的内在部分比它的外在部分更美好；“母驴的崽子”是指理性真理（<a href="2781.htm">2781</a>节）。教会的外在部分与它的内在部分是不同且分离的，因为前者在属世人，因而在外在人里面；而后者在理性人，因而在内在人里面。外在教会成员处于真理，而内在教会成员处于良善。前者不像受信之真理感染那样受仁之良善感染；而后者则受仁之良善感染，并由此受信之真理感染。后者，即内在教会成员就是“上好的葡萄树”所表示的人；而前者，即外在教会成员则是“葡萄树”所表示的人。</p>

<p align="center"><b>Potts(1905-1910) 6376</b></p><p><b>6376.</b>
And his ass's colt unto the choice vine. That this signifies [through] truth from the rational for the internal church, is evident from the signification of a "vine," as being the spiritual church (see 
n. 1069, 5113), thus a "choice vine" is the internal church, for the internal of the church is more excellent than its external; and from the signification of an "ass's colt," as being rational truth 
(n. 2781). The external of the church is distinguished from its internal in that the former is in the natural, thus in the external man; but the latter is in the rational, thus in the internal man. 
They who are in the external of the church are in truth, but they who are in its internal, are in good; the former are not so much affected with the good of charity as with the truth of faith; but the 
latter are affected with the good of charity and thence with the truth of faith. The latter are they who are signified by the "choice vine," but the former by the "vine." </p>

<p align="center"><b>Elliott(1983-1999) 6376</b></p><p><b>6376.</b>
'And the foal of his she-ass to the outstanding vine' means truth from the rational for the internal Church. This is clear from the meaning of 'the vine' as the spiritual Church, dealt with in <a href="1069.htm">1069</a>, <a href="5113.htm">5113</a>, so that 'the outstanding vine' means the internal Church (for the internal part of the Church is more outstanding than the external part of it); and from the meaning of 'the foal of a she-ass' as 
rational truth, dealt with in <a href="2781.htm">2781</a>. The external part of the Church is distinct and separate from the internal, in that it is located in the natural, thus in the external man, whereas the internal part 
is located in the rational, thus in the internal man. Members of the external Church are governed by truth, those of the internal Church by good. The former are motivated not so much by the good of 
charity as they are by the truth of faith, whereas the latter are motivated by the good of charity and from this by the truth of faith. Members of the internal Church are the ones meant by 'the outstanding 
vine', but members of the external Church are the ones meant by 'the vine'. </p>

`Et ad vitem praestantem filium asinae suae':  quod significet verum e rationali pro Ecclesia interna, constat a significatione `vitis' quod sit Ecclesia spiritualis, de qua n. 1069, 5113, ita `vitis 
praestans' est Ecclesia interna, nam internum Ecclesiae est praestans prae externo ejus; et ex significatione `filii asinae' quod sit verum rationale, de qua n. 2781.  Externum Ecclesiae distinguitur 
ab interno ejus, quod illud sit in naturali, ita in externo homine, hoc autem in rationali, ita in interno homine; qui in externo Ecclesiae sunt, in vero sunt, at qui in interno, in bono sunt; illi 
non afficiuntur ita bono charitatis {1}sicut vero fidei, hi autem afficiuntur bono charitatis et inde vero fidei; hi sunt qui significantur per `vitem praestantem', illi autem qui per `vitem'. @1 sed modo$  </p>
