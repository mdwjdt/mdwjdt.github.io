<h3 align="center" class="ired">属天的奥秘 第1011节</h3>
<h4 align="center"></h4><p><strong>1011.</strong>“他的血也必会流”表他的定罪。这从前面所述清楚可知。从字义上看，凡流人血的，即凡是杀人犯必处以死刑，但从内义上看，凡仇恨邻舍的人就会判处死刑，即判入地狱，如主在马太福音所教导的：<br />凡骂弟兄为傻瓜（希腊文∶魔利）的，必须担受地狱（希腊文∶欣嫩子谷）的火。（马太福音<a href="http://39-27.cn/太5.22.htm">5:22</a>）<br />事实上，仁爱被毁灭后，人会由着自己及其自我中心。他不再被主藉着属良知的内在约束所支配，而是受属法律的外在约束所支配，他为了自己的财富和权力而强行约束自己。一旦放松约束，如在来生的情形，他就会冲进最残酷、最下流的行为中，因而冲进自己的罪责中。“凡流人血的，他的血也必会流”是一条报应法则，这对古人来说是众所周知的，他们据此判定恶毒的罪行，这可从圣言中的许多经文明显看出来。这条法则起源于普世法则，即“你们愿意人怎样待你们，你们也要怎样待人”（马太福音<a href="http://39-27.cn/太7.12.htm">7:12</a>），还起源于以下事实：在来生，包罗万象的秩序是这样：邪恶会自我惩罚，虚假也是，因此邪恶与虚假自带惩罚。由于秩序就是邪恶自我惩罚，换句话说，恶人会冲进报应其邪恶的惩罚中，所以古人由此推出其报应的法则。这也是此处“凡流人血的，他的血也必会流”所表之义，即他会给自己定罪。</p>

<p><strong>[NCE]1011.</strong> The fact that will have their own blood shed symbolizes their damnation is established by the things said.<br />From the literal meaning comes the idea that one who sheds blood, or a murderer, should be sentenced to death. In the inner meaning, though, we find that the verse condemns to death — that is, hell — those who hate their neighbor. In Matthew the Lord teaches the same thing:<br />Any who say, "Idiot!" to their brother or sister will be subject to fiery Gehenna. (<a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_1011/bible_king-james-version_matthew_5_22" target=_top>Matthew 5:22</a>)<br />This is because when charity has been eliminated, we are left to ourselves and our own devices. No longer does the Lord rule us through the inner restraints of conscience but through external restraints that the law lays on us and that we subject ourselves to in our drive for power and riches. When the latter chains are loosened, as does happen in the other life, we plunge into the cruelest and most obscene behavior and so into our own damnation.<br />"Those who shed blood will have their own blood shed" is a retaliatory law that was very familiar to ancient people. It was the standard they used in judging evildoing and crime, as is clear from many passages in the Word.{*1} This legal principle derives its origin from the universal law that we must do to our neighbor only what we would want others to do to us (<a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_1011/bible_king-james-version_matthew_7_12" target=_top>Matthew 7:12</a>). It also results from the pattern that everything in the next life follows, in which evil actually punishes itself, as does falsity, so that evil and falsity carry their own punishment. Since this is the pattern — that evil punishes itself or, what is the same, incurs a penalty mirroring itself — from it ancient people also drew their law of retaliation. The current verse symbolizes the same thing by saying, "Those who shed blood will have their own blood shed" — that is, they will plunge into damnation.<br /><br /><strong>Footnotes:</strong><br />{*1} In <a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_1011/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_8223" target=_top>8223:1</a> and 9049:3, Swedenborg lists the following as examples of the law of retaliation: <a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_1011/bible_king-james-version_exodus_21_23-25" target=_top>Exodus 21:23-25</a>; <a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_1011/bible_king-james-version_leviticus_24_17-21" target=_top>Leviticus 24:17-21</a>; <a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_1011/bible_king-james-version_deuteronomy_19_18-19" target=_top>Deuteronomy 19:18-19</a>; <a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_1011/bible_king-james-version_matthew_7_12" target=_top>Matthew 7:12</a> (mentioned in the next sentence of this section); <a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_1011/bible_king-james-version_luke_6_31" target=_top>Luke 6:31</a>.

His blood shall be shed. That this signifies his condemnation, is evident from what has been said. It is according to the sense of the letter that the shedder of blood, or the slayer, should be punished 
with death. But in the internal sense the meaning is that he who has hatred against the neighbor is thereby condemned to death, that is, to hell, as the Lord also teaches in Matthew: </p>
<p>     Whosoever 
shall say to his brother, Thou fool, shall be in danger of the hell of fire (Matt. 5:22). For when charity is extinguished, the man is left to himself and to his Own, and is ruled by the Lord no longer 
through internal bonds, which are of conscience, but through external bonds, which are of laws, such as he himself makes for the sake of his own wealth and power. And when these bonds are relaxed, 
as is the case in the other life, he rushes into the greatest cruelty and obscenity, thus into his own condemnation. That the blood shall be shed of him who sheddeth blood is a law of retaliation well 
known to the ancients, according to which they judged crimes and wrongs, as is evident from many passages in the Word. This law has its origin in the universal law that one should not do to another 
what he would not that another should do to him (Matt. 7:12); as also from this, that it is the order universal in the other life that evil punishes itself, and likewise falsity; thus that in evil and 
falsity is its own punishment. And because there is such order that evil punishes itself, or what is the same, that an evil man rushes into punishment answering to his evil, the ancients deduced from 
this their law of retaliation as is here also signified by the declaration that whoso sheddeth blood, his blood shall be shed, that is, he will rush into condemnation. </p>

<p align="center"><b>Elliott(1983-1999) 1011</b></p><p><b>1011.</b>
'His blood shall be shed' means his condemnation. This is clear from what has been stated. The sense of the letter implies that anyone who sheds blood, that is, who is a murderer, must be punished with 
death, but the internal sense implies that hatred of the neighbour condemns a person to death, that is, to hell, as the Lord also teaches in Matthew, </p>
<blockquote>
Whoever says to his brother, You fool! will 
be liable to the Gehenna of fire. <a href="http://bible.gospelcom.net/cgi-bin/bible?passage=Matt%205:22&amp;version=ESV&amp;interface=print&amp;showfn=yes&amp;showxref">Matt 5:22</a>. 
</blockquote>
<p>Indeed when charity has been destroyed a person is left to himself and his proprium. He is no longer governed by the Lord by means of internal bonds, which 
are those of conscience, but by external bonds which are those of the law and those which he imposes upon himself so that he may be powerful and wealthy. And once these bonds are loosed, as indeed 
happens in the next life, he rushes into the most merciless and disgusting practices, and so to his own condemnation. 'His blood shall be shed who sheds blood' is a law of retaliation very well known 
to the ancients, by which they judged evil-minded and criminal acts, as is clear from many places in the Word. This law has its origin in the universal law, Do to your neighbour only what you would 
like others to do to you, <a href="http://bible.gospelcom.net/cgi-bin/bible?passage=Matt%207:12&amp;version=ESV&amp;interface=print&amp;showfn=yes&amp;showxref">Matt 7:12</a>, and also in the fact that the order embracing everything in the next life is such that evil punishes itself, as does falsity also, so that evil and falsity carry 
their own punishment And because order is such that evil punishes itself, or what amounts to the same, an evil man rushes into a form of punishment answering to his evil, the ancients derived from it 
their law of retaliation. It also is what is meant by the pronouncement here that 'whoever sheds blood his blood shall be shed', that is, he will rush into condemnation. </p>

<p align="center"><b>Latin(1748-1756) 1011</b>
</p><b>1011.</b>
'Sanguis ejus effundetur': quod significet condemnationem ejus, constat ex iis quae dicta sunt: ex sensu litterae est, quod effusor sanguinis seu occisor morte puniendus; in sensu autem interno, qui 
odium habet contra proximum, quod eum condemnet ad mortem, hoc est, ad infernum; quod etiam Dominus docet apud Matthaeum, 	Quicumque dixerit fratri suo, Fatue, obnoxius erit gehennae ignis, v 22; </p>
<p>exstincta 
enim charitate homo sibi suoque proprio relinquitur, et non amplius per vincula interna quae sunt conscientiae, sed per vincula externa quae sunt legis et quae ipse sibi facit ut potens et dives 
sit, regitur a Domino; quibus vinculis relaxatis, ut fit quoque in altera vita, ruit in crudelissima et obscenissima, ita in condemnationem sui. Quod sanguis ejus effundetur qui effuderit sanguinem, 
est jus talionis antiquis notissimum, secundum quod judicarunt malitias et scelera; ut constat a pluribus locis Verbi; hoc jus trahit originem suam ex lege universali, 	Quod proximo non aliud faciendum, 
quam quod velit ut alii faciant sibi, Matth. vii 12, tum ex eo, quod ordo omnium in altera vita sit ut ipsum malum se puniat, similiter falsum, sic ut in ipso malo et falso sit poena ejus; et 
quia talis ordo est quod malum se puniat, seu quod idem, malus incurrat in poenam malo respondentem, ex illo duxerunt etiam antiqui talionis eorum jus; quod hic quoque significatur per id quod 'qui effudit 
sanguinem, ejus sanguis effundetur,' hoc est, quod in condemnationem irruet. </p>
