<h3 align="center" class="ired">属天的奥秘 第318节</h3>
<h4 align="center"></h4><p><strong>318.</strong>某个灵前来和我说话，一些迹象表明，他刚离世不久。起初他不知道自己在哪，全当自己仍在尘世。后来，当他发现自己到了灵界，已一无所有，房屋、钱财等都已丧失时，他忧心忡忡，无所适从。此时，他被告知，唯独主供养他并所有人。我留下他独自思考，如在尘世那样。他考虑着（在灵界，每个人的思维可能被清楚地觉察到），现在既已失去一切生存工具，他当做什么。在忧虑中，他被带到一些属天之灵当中。这些灵属于心脏部位，给他提供一切帮助，然后又留下他独自思考。因为仁爱之心，他思考着当如何回报这些大的恩情。由此显然，在肉身时，他过着仁爱的生活。因此，他立刻被带上了天堂。</p>

<p><strong>[NCE]318.</strong> A man came and spoke to me who, as certain signs indicated, had recently departed from life. At first he did not realize where he was, supposing himself to be in the world.<br />I then informed him that he was in the next life and that he no longer had any possessions — house, money, and so on — but was in another realm, where he lacked everything he had owned in the world. Filled with anxiety over this, he did not know what direction to go or where he would live; but I told him that the Lord alone looks out for him and for everyone. Afterward I left him alone to think as he had thought in the world. He started to wonder (everyone's thoughts can be perceived clearly in the other life) what he should do now, being destitute of everything that had allowed him to stay alive.<br />Still laboring under this anxiety, he was transferred to the company of spirits with a heavenly nature. They were in the vicinity of the heart{*1} and everything he wanted, whatever it was, they helped him with. This done, he was again left alone and, under the inspiration of charity, began to consider how he could repay such great kindness. All this showed that in the life of the body he had possessed the charity that belongs to faith. As a result he was lifted up into heaven instantly.<br /><br /><strong>Footnotes:</strong><br />{*1} The communities of the next life come together to form a single human being, each community serving the function of a different body part of that being, as described in <a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_318/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_550" target=_top>550</a>, <a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_318/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_686" target=_top>686-687</a>, <a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_318/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_1285#subsection-2-2" target=_top>1285:2</a>, and in the material following each of Swedenborg's separate discussions of chapters 27-42 in Genesis.

A certain spirit came and discoursed with me, who, as was evident from certain signs, had only lately died. At first he knew not where he was, supposing himself still to be in the world; but when he 
became conscious that he was in the other life, and that he no longer possessed anything, such as house, wealth, and the like, being in another kingdom, where he was deprived of all he had possessed in 
the world, he was seized with anxiety, and knew not where to betake himself, or whither to go for a place of abode. He was then informed that the Lord alone provides for him and for all; and was left 
to himself, that his thoughts might take their wonted direction, as in the world. He now considered (for in the other life the thoughts of all may be plainly perceived) what he must do, being deprived 
of all means of subsistence; and while in this state of anxiety he was brought into association with some celestial spirits who belonged to the province of the heart, and who showed him every attention 
that he could desire. This being done, he was again left to himself, and began to think, from charity, how he might repay kindness so great, from which it was evident that while he had lived in the 
body he had been in the charity of faith, and he was therefore at once taken up into heaven. </p>

A certain spirit once came and spoke to me. Certain signs made it clear that he had only recently departed the earthly life. Imagining that he was still in the world, he did not at first know where he 
was; but once he was given to know that he was in the next life and that he no longer had any material possessions, such as a home, wealth, and the like, but was in another realm in which he had been 
divested of all he possessed in the world, he was greatly distressed, not knowing which way he was to go or where he was going to live. He was told however that the Lord alone provided for him and for 
everyone. He was at that point left to himself to think in the same way as he had done in the world. He began to think about what he would do now that he had been deprived of all those things that 
had made life possible (everybody's thoughts in the next life are plainly perceived). But in his distress he was brought into the company of celestial spirits who were from the province of the heart and 
who rendered him whatever kindly service he desired. After this he was left to himself again, and by virtue of charity began to think about how he could repay so much kindness. All this proved that 
during his lifetime he had been governed by charity derived from faith. Consequently he was raised up straightaway into heaven. </p>

</p><b>318.</b>
Quidam ad me venit et mecum locutus; ex quibusdam signis constare potuit quod nuper e vita excesserit; primum nesciebat ubinam esset putans se esse in mundo: cumque ei datum scire quod in altera vita, 
et quod nunc non haberet quicquam, ut domum, opes, et similia, sed quod esset in alio regno, ubi privatus omnibus quae habuit in mundo, tunc anxietate affectus nesciebat quo se conferret, quoque habitaret; 
sed ei dicebatur quod solus Dominus ei et omnibus prospiciat; tunc relictus sibi, ut cogitaret sicut in mundo, et cogitabat (omnium enim cogitationes in altera vita percipi manifeste possunt) 
quid tunc faceret, quia absque omnibus iis ex quibus potuisset vivere: sed cum in anxietate illa esset, transferebatur inter spiritus caelestes qui erant ex cordis provincia; illi ei omnia officia praestabant 
quaecumque usque desiderabat; hoc facto iterum sibi relictus, cogitare ex charitate coepit quomodo tantam gratiam rependere posset, ex quibus constabat quod dum in vita corporis, in fidei charitate 
fuerit, quare statim in caelum sublatus est. </p>
