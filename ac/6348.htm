<h4 align="center"></h4><p><strong>6348.</strong>“因为你上了你父亲的床”表因为当与仁之良善分离时，它就有一种污秽的苟合。这从“上了父亲的床”的含义清楚可知，“上了父亲的床”是指有一种污秽的苟合，也就是说，与仁之良善分离的信就有这种苟合。因为此处流便所代表的教义或理解力中的信若没有被引入良善，并与其苟合，要么被驱散，要么化为乌有，不再是任何东西，要么被引入邪恶与虚假，并与其结合，所指的就是这种污秽的苟合，因为那时亵渎就产生了。这是真相，这一点可从以下事实看出来：除了在良善里面外，信在其它地方没有一个居所；它若在那里没有一个居所，就不可避免地要么化为乌有，不再是任何东西，要么与邪恶苟合。这一点从来世那些只持守信，根本不持守仁的人很明显地看出来。他们的信在来世消散了；但如果他们的信与邪恶苟合，那么等待他们的，就是亵渎者的命运。<br />在圣言中，“通奸”在内义上表示对良善的玷污，而“淫行”表示对真理的歪曲（参看<a href="2466.htm">2466</a>，<a href="3399.htm">3399</a>节）。但被称为淫乱禁令（参看利未记<a href="http://39-27.cn/利18.6.htm">18:6</a>-<a href="http://39-27.cn/利18.24.htm">24</a>）的污秽苟合表示各种亵渎。此处所指的也是亵渎，这是显而易见的，因为经上说：“你上了你父亲的床，那时便污秽了它；他上了我的榻”。至于这些话表示分离之信对良善的亵渎，可参看前文（<a href="4601.htm">4601</a>节），那里论述了流便的可耻恶行。<br />唯信或与仁分离之信具有这样的性质：如果这信与邪恶结合，如当一个人首先相信信之真理，尤其他一开始照之生活，后来又离弃它，并过着与它相背离的生活之时的情形），那么它就成了亵渎。因为信之真理与仁之良善先是通过教义和生活植根于此人的内层，后来又从那里被召唤出来，与邪恶结合。在来世，等待此人的命运是最坏的；因为在这种人身上，良善无法与邪恶分离；然而，在来世，它们是分离的；这种人也没有储存在其内层的任何良善的余留，因为他们在邪恶中完全灭亡了。他们的地狱在左前方相当远的距离处，在天使眼里，那里的人就像骷髅，几乎没有任何生命。因此，为防止亵渎良善与真理，那种不肯让自己重生（这是主所预见的）的人就会退离信与仁，被允许陷入邪恶，由此陷入虚假。因为在这种情况下，他无法亵渎任何事物。关于亵渎的阐述和说明，可参看前文（<a href="301.htm">301</a>-<a href="303.htm">303</a>，<a href="571.htm">571</a>，<a href="582.htm">582</a>，<a href="593.htm">593</a>，<a href="1001.htm">1001</a>，<a href="1008.htm">1008</a>，<a href="1010.htm">1010</a>，<a href="1059.htm">1059</a>，<a href="1327.htm">1327</a>，<a href="1328.htm">1328</a>，<a href="2051.htm">2051</a>，<a href="2426.htm">2426</a>，<a href="3398.htm">3398</a>，<a href="3399.htm">3399</a>，<a href="3402.htm">3402</a>，<a href="3489.htm">3489</a>，<a href="3898.htm">3898</a>，<a href="4289.htm">4289</a>，<a href="4601.htm">4601</a>节）。</p>

Because thou wentest up on thy father's bed. That this signifies, because when separated from the good of charity it has a foul conjunction, is evident from the signification of "going up on a father's 
bed," as being to have a foul conjunction, namely, that faith separated from the good of charity has this. For if faith in doctrine or in the understanding, here represented by Reuben, is not initiated 
into good and conjoined therewith, it is either dissipated and made null, or is initiated into and conjoined with what is evil and false, which is the foul conjunction that is signified, for it then 
becomes profane. That this is so may be seen from the fact that faith can have a dwelling-place nowhere else than in good, and if it has no dwelling-place there, it must either become null, or be 
conjoined with evil. This is very evident from those in the other life who have been in faith alone and in no charity, in that their faith is there dissipated; but if it has been conjoined with evil, 
their lot is with the profane. [2] In the Word, "adulteries" in the internal sense signify adulterations of good, and "whoredoms" signify falsifications of truth (see n. 2466, 3399); but the foul conjunctions 
called the forbidden degrees (see Lev. 18:6-24), signify various kinds of profanation. That here also profanation is signified, is plain, for it is said "thou wentest up on thy father's bed, 
then profanedst thou it; he went up on my couch." That this means the profanation of good by faith separated, may be seen above (n. 4601), where this wicked deed of Reuben is treated of. [3] With faith 
alone, or separated from charity, the case is this. If it is conjoined with evil (which takes place when anyone first believes the truth that is of faith, and especially when he first lives according 
to it, and afterward denies it and lives contrary to it), it then becomes profane; for thus the truth that is of faith and the good that is of charity are first inrooted in the interiors by means 
of doctrine and life, and afterward are called forth thence and conjoined with evil. In the other life the worst lot of all awaits the man with whom this takes place; for with such a man good cannot be 
separated from evil, and yet in the other life they are kept separate; neither has such a man any remains of good stored up in his interiors, because they have utterly perished in evil. The hell of 
such is to the left in front at a great distance, and those who are there appear to the angelic sight like skeletons, with scarcely any life. In order therefore to prevent the profanation of good and 
truth, a man who is such that he does not suffer himself to be regenerated (which is foreseen by the Lord) is withheld from faith and charity, and is permitted to be in evil and from this in falsity, 
for then he cannot profane. (See what has been said and shown before about profanation, n. 301-303, 571, 582, 593, 1001, 1008, 1010, 1059, 1327, 1328, 2051, 2426, 3398, 3399, 3402, 3489, 3898, 4289, 4601.) </p>

'because you went up to your father's bed' means because when separated from the good of charity faith is involved in a foul liaison. This is clear from the meaning of 'going up to his father's bed' 
as being involved in a foul liaison; that is to say, faith separated from charity is involved in it. For if faith in doctrine or the understanding, which 'Reuben' represents here, is not introduced to 
good and joined to it, it is either dissipated or ceases to be anything, or else it is introduced to evil and falsity and joined to them, which is the foul liaison that is meant. For then profanity comes 
about. The truth of this may be recognized from the fact that faith cannot have a dwelling-place anywhere else than within good; and if it does not have a dwelling-place there, then inevitably it 
ceases to be anything or is joined to evil. This is plainly evident from those people in the next life who have adhered to faith alone and not at all to charity. Their faith is dissipated in that life; 
or if it has been joined to evil, a lot among profaners awaits them. </p>

 In the internal sense of the Word instances of adultery mean adulterations of good, while instances of whoredom mean falsifications 
of truth, <a href="2466.htm">2466</a>, <a href="3399.htm">3399</a> But foul liaisons - which are called the forbidden degrees [of sexual relations], dealt with in <a href="http://bible.gospelcom.net/cgi-bin/bible?passage=Lev%2018:6-24%20-&amp;version=ESV&amp;interface=print&amp;showfn=yes&amp;showxref">Lev 18:6-24 -</a> mean various kinds of profanation. Profanation is obviously 
meant here also since the words used are, 'You went up to your father's bed; at that time you profaned [it] - he went up to my couch'. Regarding the meaning of these words as the profanation of good 
by separated faith, see <a href="4601.htm">4601</a>, where that unspeakable deed performed by Reuben is dealt with.  </p>

 The nature of faith alone or faith separated from charity is such that if it is joined to evil - 
as happens when a person first believes the truth of faith, and especially when initially he leads a life in accordance with it but after that renounces it and leads a life contrary to it- profanity takes 
place. For the truth of faith and the good of charity first become rooted through doctrine and life in the person's interiors, after which they are called forth from there and are joined to evil. 
The lot that awaits the person in whom this happens is the worst of all in the next life; for with someone like that, good is incapable of being separated from evil, though they are nevertheless separated 
in the next life. Nor does someone like that have any remnants of good stored away in him interiorly because they have perished altogether in evil. Their hell is located on the left out in front, 
a considerable distance away; and those who are there look to the angels like skeletons, possessing scarcely any life. Therefore to avoid the occurrence of the profanation of goodness and truth, the 
person who - the Lord foresees - is the kind that will not allow himself to be regenerated is held back from faith and charity and is allowed to immerse himself in evil and consequently in falsity. For 
in this condition he cannot profane anything.

`Quia ascendisti cubilia patris tui':  quod significet quia separata a bono quod charitatis, foedam conjunctionem habet, constat ex significatione `ascendere cubilia patris' quod sit foedam conjunctionem 
habere, nempe fides separata a bono quod charitatis; fides enim doctrina seu intellectu, quae hic per `Reubenem' repraesentatur, si non initiatur in bonum, et ei conjungitur, vel dissipatur et nulla 
fit, vel initiatur et conjungitur malo ac falso, quod est foeda conjunctio quae significatur; tunc enim fit prophanum; {1}quod ita sit, constare potest ex eo quod fides non alibi possit habitaculum 
habere quam in bono, et si non ibi habitaculum habet, necessum est ut vel nulla fiat vel ut conjungatur malo; hoc patet manifeste ex illis in altera vita qui in sola fide et in nulla charitate fuerunt, 
quod dissipetur ibi fides, at si conjuncta {2}est cum malo, quod sortem cum profanis accipiant.  [2]In Verbo per `adulteria' in sensu interno significantur adulterationes boni, et per `scortationes' 
falsificationes veri, n. 2466, 3399; at per foedas conjunctiones quae vocantur gradus prohibiti, de quibus Lev. xviii 6-24, significantur profanationum varia genera; quod hic quoque profanatio, patet, 
nam dicitur `ascendisti cubilia patris tui, tunc profanasti, stratum meum ascendit'; quod sit profanatio boni per fidem separatam, videatur n. 4601, ubi de nefando illo facto Reubenis agitur.  [3]Cum 
fide sola seu separata a charitate {3} ita se habet:  si conjungitur illa malo, quod fit cum primum creditur vero quod fidei, et magis cum primum vivitur secundum illud (c)ac deinceps negatur (c)et 
vivitur contra illud, tunc fit profanum, nam verum quod fidei et bonum quod charitatis, per doctrinam et vitam primum {4}irradicata sunt in interioribus, et postmodum {5}illa inde {6}evocantur et conjunguntur 
malo; homini apud quem hoc fit, sors omnium pessima est in altera vita, non enim (t)apud talem potest separari bonum a malo, quae tamen separantur in altera vita, nec talis habet aliquas reliquias 
boni in interioribus suis reconditas, quia in malo prorsus perierunt; infernum illorum est a parte anteriore sinistrorsum ad multam distantiam; et qui ibi sunt, apparent ad visum angelicum sicut 
sceleta, vix alicujus vitae.  Ne itaque profanatio boni et veri fiat, homo qui talis est ut non patiatur se regenerari, quod praevidetur a Domino, detinetur a fide et {7} charitate, et (t)ei permittitur 
ut in malo sit et inde in falso; tunc enim non profanare potest; {8} videantur quae prius de profanatione dicta et ostensa sunt, n. 301-303, 571, 582, 593, 1001, 1008, 1010, 1059, 1327, 1328, 2051,
