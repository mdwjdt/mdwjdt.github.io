<h3 align="center" class="ired">属天的奥秘 第4985节</h3>
<h4 align="center"></h4><p><strong>4985.</strong>“约瑟原来体态秀雅”表源于此的生活良善；“容貌俊美”表源于此的信之真理。这从“体态秀雅”和“容貌俊美”的含义清楚可知；因为“体态”是事物的本质，而“容貌”是源于它的外在显现。由于良善是真正的本质，真理是源于它的外在显现，所以“体态秀雅”表示生活的良善，“容貌俊美”表示信之真理。事实上，生活的良善是人的本质存在，因为它居于他的意愿，而信之真理是它的显现，因为它居于他的理解力；凡居于理解力的，都是来源于意愿的某种事物的一种显现。构成人生命的本质存在居于其意愿的意图，而其生命的显现居于其理解力的思维。人的理解力无非是其意愿的展开，并赋予意愿一种形式，好使意愿的真正性质能显现于外表。<br />由此可见“秀雅”，也就是内层人的美丽从何而来，即它经由信之真理来自意愿的良善。信之真理将美丽呈现于外在形式中，而意愿的良善则赋予这种美丽，并形成它，也就是说，是外在形式的产生者。正因如此，天堂天使具有无法描述的美丽，因为每位天使可以说都是形式上的爱与仁；因此，当他们显现出自己的美丽时，这美感染至内层。因为从主所接受的爱之良善通过信之真理从他们透现出来，进入他，激发他里面的这些感觉。由此明显可知，“体态秀雅”和“容貌俊美”在内义上表示什么（参看<a href="3821.htm">3821</a>节）。</p>

And Joseph was beautiful in form, signifies the good of life thence derived, and beautiful in look, signifies the truth of faith thence derived, as is evident from the signification of "beautiful in 
form" and "beautiful in look;" for "form" is the essence of a thing, and "look" is the manifestation thence derived; and because good is the very essence, and truth the manifestation thence derived; thence, 
by "beautiful in form" is signified the good of life, and by "beautiful in look" the truth of faith. For the good of life is the very being of man, because it is of his will; and the truth of faith 
is the coming forth thence derived, because it is of his understanding; for whatever is of the understanding comes forth from the will. The being of man's life is in his willing, and the coming forth 
of his life is in his understanding. The understanding of man is nothing else than the will unfolded, and so put in form that its quality may appear in its look. From this it is plain whence is the 
beauty (that is, of the interior man), namely, from the good of the will through the truth of faith. The very truth of faith presents beauty in the external form, but the good of the will imparts and 
forms it. From this it is that the angels of heaven are of ineffable beauty, being as it were loves and charities in form; and therefore when they appear in their beauty, they affect the inmosts. With 
them, the good of love from the Lord shines forth through the truth of faith, and as it penetrates it affects. Hence it is evident what is signified in the internal sense by "beautiful in form and 
beautiful in look" (see also n. 3821). </p>

<p align="center"><b>Elliott(1983-1999) 4985</b></p><p><b>4985.</b>
'And Joseph was beautiful in form' means the good of life springing from this, 'and beautiful in appearance' means the truth of faith springing from it. This is clear from the meaning of 'beautiful in 
form and beautiful in appearance', for 'the form' is the essence of a thing, whereas 'the appearance' is the outward manifestation derived from it. And since good is the actual essence and truth is 
the outward manifestation springing from it, 'beautiful in form' means the good of life and 'beautiful in appearance' the truth of faith. For the good of life is a person's essential being (esse) since 
it resides in his will, while the truth of faith is the manifestation of it since it inhabits his understanding. Indeed whatever inhabits the understanding is a manifestation of something that originates 
in the will. The essential being (esse) constituting a person's life resides in the intentions of his will, and the manifestation (existere) of his life resides in the thoughts of his understanding. 
A person's understanding is nothing else than an unfolding of his will, also the imparting of a form to it that enables its true nature to be seen in an outward appearance. </p>
<p></p>
<p><b>[2]</b>
 From this one may 
see where the beauty - the beauty of the interior man - comes from. That is, it comes from the good present in the will by way of the truth of faith. The truth of faith presents that beauty in an outward 
form, but the good in the will is the supplier of that beauty and the producer of the outward form. Here is the reason for the indescribable beauty of the angels of heaven, for each is so to speak 
love and charity embodied in a form. When therefore anyone sees them in their beauty his deepest feelings are stirred. For the good of love received from the Lord shines forth from them through the 
truth of faith, enters into him, and stirs those feelings within him. From this, as also in <a href="3821.htm">3821</a>, one may see what is meant in the internal sense by 'beautiful in form and beautiful in appearance. </p>

</p><b>4985.</b>
`Et erat Joseph pulcher forma': quod significet bonum vitae inde, `et pulcher aspectu quod significet verum fidei inde, constat ex significatione `pulchri forma et pulchri aspectu'; forma enim est 
rei essentia, aspectus autem est existentia inde; et quia bonum est ipsa essentia, et verum est existentia inde, per `pulchrum forma' significatur bonum vitae, et per `pulchrum aspectu' verum fidei; 
nam bonum vitae est ipsum esse hominis quia est voluntatis ejus, et verum fidei est existere inde quia est intellectus; </p>
<p>quicquid enim est intellectus, id existit a voluntate; esse vitae hominis 
est in ejus velle, et existere vitae ejus est in ejus intelligere; intellectus hominis non aliud est quam voluntas explicata, et formata ita ut appareat qualis est aspectu.  [2] Inde patet unde pulchritudo, 
nempe interioris hominis, quod sit ex bono voluntatis per verum fidei; ipsum verum fidei sistit pulchritudinem in externa forma, sed bonum voluntatis indit illam et format illam; </p>
<p>inde est 
quod angeli caeli sint pulchritudine ineffabili, sunt enim quasi amores et charitates in forma; quapropter eum apparent in sua pulchritudine, afficiunt intima; apud illos bonum amoris a Domino elucet 
per verum fidei, et penetrando afficit. Inde constare potest quid in sensu interno per `pulchrum forma et pulchrum aspectu' significatur, ut quoque n. 3821. </p>
