<h3 align="center" class="ired">属天的奥秘 第6366节</h3>
<h4 align="center"></h4><p><strong>6366.</strong>“你父亲的儿子们必向你下拜”表真理必自动顺服。这从“下拜”和“父亲的儿子们”的含义清楚可知：“下拜”是指顺服；“父亲的儿子们”是指源于属灵良善的真理，因为“以色列的儿子们”是指属灵真理（参看<a href="5414.htm">5414</a>，<a href="5879.htm">5879</a>，<a href="5951.htm">5951</a>节），“以色列”是指属灵良善（<a href="5801.htm">5801</a>，<a href="5803.htm">5803</a>，<a href="5806.htm">5806</a>，<a href="5812.htm">5812</a>，<a href="5817.htm">5817</a>，<a href="5819.htm">5819</a>，<a href="5826.htm">5826</a>，<a href="5833.htm">5833</a>节）。这些真理之所以自动顺服，是因为当“犹大”所代表的属天之爱流入“以色列的儿子们”所代表的属灵真理时，它会重新将它们排列得井然有序，由此使它们顺服于主。事实上，属天事物通过流入属灵事物而产生这种果效；也就是说，良善通过流入真理而具有这种能力。这也解释了为何主的属天国度是至内或第三层天堂，因而离主最近；而属灵国度是中间或第二层天堂，因而离主较远。正因它们以这种秩序被排列，所以主流入属灵国度，既间接通过属天国度流入，也直接流入。祂的流注具有这种性质：属灵国度通过属天国度被保持在秩序中，并以这种方式顺服于主。从属天国度而来的流注通过对邻之爱实现，因为这爱就是属天国度的外在，属灵国度的内在，并使得这二者联结在一起（参看<a href="5922.htm">5922</a>节）。</p>

Thy father's sons shall bow down to thee. That this signifies that truths will submit themselves of their own accord, is evident from the signification of "bowing down," as being to submit themselves; 
and from the signification of the "father's sons," as being the truths that are from spiritual good, for the "sons of Israel" denote spiritual truths (see n. 5414, 5879, 5951), and "Israel" is spiritual 
good (n. 5801, 5803, 5806, 5812, 5817, 5819, 5826, 5833). That these truths will submit themselves of their own accord, is because when celestial love, which is represented by Judah, flows into the 
spiritual truths which are represented by the sons of Israel, it disposes them into order, and thus submits them to the Lord; for the celestial has this efficacy through influx into spiritual things, 
that is, good through influx into truth. For this reason also the Lord's celestial kingdom is the inmost or third heaven, thus is nearest the Lord; and His spiritual kingdom is the middle or second 
heaven, thus is further away from the Lord. It is from this order that the Lord flows into the spiritual kingdom, both mediately through the celestial kingdom, and also immediately. The influx is of 
such a nature that the spiritual kingdom is kept in order by means of the celestial kingdom, and in this way is submitted to the Lord. The influx from the celestial kingdom is effected by means of love 
toward the neighbor, for this is the external of the celestial kingdom and the internal of the spiritual kingdom; hence the conjunction of both (see n. 5922). </p>

<p align="center"><b>Elliott(1983-1999) 6366</b></p><p><b>6366.</b>
'Your father's sons will bow down to you' means that truths will submit themselves of their own accord. This is clear from the meaning of 'bowing down' as submitting oneself, and from the meaning of 
'father's sons' as truths that spring from spiritual good; for 'the sons of Israel' are spiritual truths, <a href="5414.htm">5414</a>, <a href="5879.htm">5879</a>, <a href="5951.htm">5951</a>, and 'Israel' is spiritual good, <a href="5801.htm">5801</a>, <a href="5803.htm">5803</a>, <a href="5806.htm">5806</a>, <a href="5812.htm">5812</a>, <a href="5817.htm">5817</a>, <a href="5819.htm">5819</a>, <a href="5826.htm">5826</a>, <a href="5833.htm">5833</a>. 
The reason why those truths submit themselves of their own accord is that when celestial love, represented by 'Judah', flows into spiritual truths, represented by 'the sons of Israel', it rearranges 
them into order and submits them in that condition to the Lord. For by flowing into spiritual things what is celestial has the capacity to produce that effect; that is, good has that capacity by flowing 
into truth. This also explains why the Lord's celestial kingdom is the inmost or third heaven, thus is the one closest to the Lord, while His spiritual kingdom is the middle or second heaven, and 
so is further away from the Lord. It is because they are arranged in this order that the Lord flows indirectly into the spiritual kingdom by way of the celestial kingdom, as well as directly. The nature 
of His inflow is such that the spiritual kingdom is maintained in order by means of the celestial and in that condition made submissive to the Lord. The inflow takes place from the celestial kingdom 
through love towards the neighbour, since that love is the exterior of the celestial kingdom and the interior of the spiritual kingdom and causes the two to be joined together, see <a href="5922.htm">5922</a>. </p>

`Incurvabunt se tibi filii patris tui':  quod significet quod vera se submittent ex se, constat ex significatione `incurvare se' quod sit se submittere; et ex significatione `filiorum patris' quod sint 
vera quae ex bono spirituali, `filii' enim `Israelis' sunt vera spiritualia, n. 5414, 5879, 5951, et `Israel' est bonum spirituale, {1} n. 5801, 5803, 5806, 5812, 5817, 5819, 5826, 5833; quod vera 
illa submittent se ex se, est quia amor caelestis, qui repraesentatur per `Jehudam', cum influit in vera spiritualia quae repraesentantur per `filios Israelis', disponat illa in ordinem ac ita submittat 
Domino; caeleste enim hanc efficaciam habet per influxum in spiritualia, seu bonum per influxum in verum; quapropter etiam regnum caeleste Domini est caelum intimum seu tertium, ita Domino proximum, 
et regnum spirituale Ipsius, est caelum medium seu secundum, ita a Domino remotius; {2}ex ordine illo est quod Dominus per regnum caeleste influat in regnum spirituale {3} mediate, et praeterea quoque 
immediate; talis influxus est, ut spirituale regnum in ordine teneatur per caeleste, ac ita submittatur Domino:  influxus fit (c)e caelesti regno per {4}amorem erga proximum, hoc enim est externum 
regni caelestis, et est internum regni spiritualis, inde conjunctio utriusque, videatur n. 5922.   @1 i de qua$ @2 et regnum caeleste influit in regnum spirituale, hoc est,$ @3 i sic$ @4 charitatem$ </p>
