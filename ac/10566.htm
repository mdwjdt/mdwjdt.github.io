<h3 align="center" class="ired">属天的奥秘 第10566节</h3>
<h4 align="center"></h4><p><strong>10566</strong>.“求你想到这民族是你的人民”表他们是这个世界上唯一与掌管万有的神性同住的人。这从“耶和华的民族”的含义清楚可知。“耶和华的民族”是指神性本身所住的地方，在灵义上是指主的教会所住的地方，因为所有以信和爱承认主的人合起来就是耶和华的民族。但那时以色列人没有想到教会，只想着占领迦南地，以及超越他人的显赫。仅仅因为摩西被告知他们的神名叫他们以前闻所未闻的耶和华（出埃及记<a href="http://39-27.cn/出3.13.htm">3:13</a>，<a href="http://39-27.cn/出3.14.htm">14</a>），还因为他们见证了祂在埃及、红海和旷野所行的如此大的奇迹，所以他们才承认耶和华是他们的神。但即便如此，他们从心里不信祂，因为他们相信有许多神。这一点从金牛犊和此后的神明可以看出来：当摩西迟延（下山）时，他们将金牛犊奉为自己的神，事实上奉为耶和华（注：jehovah，此处耶和华的首字母是小写）；后来他们又常常转向别神，这从圣言的历史部分明显看出来。由此可见，他们敬拜耶和华，完全是因为神迹，而不是因为唯独祂是神；凡仅仅因为神迹而敬拜神的人都只敬拜神的名，而不敬拜神自己，并且每当不能实现自己的愿望时，就会背离这名。以色列民族敬拜耶和华，但只拜祂的名（参看<a href="3732.htm">3732</a>e，<a href="4299.htm">4299</a>，<a href="6877.htm">6877</a>节）；他们心里是偶像崇拜者（<a href="4208.htm">4208</a>，<a href="4281.htm">4281</a>，<a href="4820.htm">4820</a>，<a href="5998.htm">5998</a>，<a href="6877.htm">6877</a>，<a href="7401.htm">7401</a>，<a href="8301.htm">8301</a>，<a href="8882.htm">8882</a>节）；他们是最坏的民族（<a href="4314.htm">4314</a>，<a href="4316.htm">4316</a>，<a href="4317.htm">4317</a>，<a href="4444.htm">4444</a>，<a href="4503.htm">4503</a>，<a href="4750.htm">4750</a>，<a href="4751.htm">4751</a>，<a href="4815.htm">4815</a>，<a href="4820.htm">4820</a>，<a href="4832.htm">4832</a>，<a href="5057.htm">5057</a>，<a href="7248.htm">7248</a>，<a href="8819.htm">8819</a>，<a href="9320.htm">9320</a>，以及<a href="10396.htm">10396</a>节）。由此可见“这个民族是你的人民”表示什么，即：他们是唯一与耶和华同住的人，他们将由此而比其它所有民族都要优越。但是，尽管就近似意义而言，这些话表示这些事；然而，就内义而言，这些话表示神性，因而教会将与他们同住。</p>

And see that this nation is Thy people. That this signifies that they are the only ones in the world with whom is the Divine which is over all things, is evident from the signification of "the nation 
of Jehovah," as being where the Divine Itself dwells, and in the spiritual sense where the church of the Lord is, for all those who acknowledge the Lord in faith and love, taken together, are "the nation 
of Jehovah." But at that time the sons of Israel thought nothing of the church; but only of the possession of the land of Canaan, and of eminence over others. And as it was told Moses that the name 
of their God was Jehovah, which, however, they had not previously known (Exod. 3:13, 14); and because they saw such great miracles wrought by Him in Egypt, and at the Red Sea, and in the wilderness, 
they therefore acknowledged Jehovah for their God. Nevertheless in their hearts they did not believe in Him, for they believed that there were many gods, as can be sufficiently well seen from the golden 
calf which, while Moses tarried, they adored as their god, yea as jehovah;* and afterward from the gods to whom they so often turned aside, as is evident from the historical parts of the Word. From 
all this it can be seen that they worshiped Jehovah merely on account of the miracles, and not because He alone was God; and he who worships God merely on account of miracles, only worships the name 
of God, and not God, and falls away whenever he does not obtain his desires. (That the Israelitish nation worshiped Jehovah merely in respect to the name, see n. 3732, 4299, 6877; and that at heart 
they were idolaters, n. 4208, 4281, 4820, 5998, 6877, 7401, 8301, 8882; and that they were the worst nation, n. 4314, 4316, 4317, 4444, 4503, 4750, 4751, 4815, 4820, 4832, 5057, 7248, 8819, 9320, and 
further, n. 10396.) From all this it can now be seen what is signified by the words "this nation is Thy people," namely, that they were the only ones among whom was Jehovah, and that in this way they 
would become preeminent to all other nations. But although in the proximate sense, these things are signified by these words, nevertheless by the same words in the internal sense is signified that the 
Divine was with them, consequently the church. * The name "jehovah" is in this connection given by Swedenborg with a small initial letter, doubtless because as applied to the golden calf the name is 
profane and unworthy of veneration. The same remark applies to "divine" as here used, for contrary to his usual custom Swedenborg here writes this word with a small initial letter. See also n. 10566, 
10603. [REVISER.] </p>

'And consider that this nation is Your people' means that they alone in the world are the ones with whom the Divine, the ruler over all things, resides. This is clear from the meaning of 'Jehovah's nation' 
as where the Divine Himself resides, and in the spiritual sense where the Lord's Church resides; for all taken together who acknowledge the Lord in faith and love are Jehovah's nation. But the 
children of Israel at that time had no thoughts of the Church, only of possessing the land of Canaan and of their pre-eminence over others. It was only because Moses had been told that the name of their 
God, which they had not known previously, was Jehovah, <a href="http://bible.gospelcom.net/cgi-bin/bible?passage=Exod%203:13,14&amp;version=ESV&amp;interface=print&amp;showfn=yes&amp;showxref">Exod 3:13,14</a>, and because they witnessed such great miracles performed by Him in Egypt, at the Sea Suph, and in the wilderness, that they acknowledged 
Jehovah as their God. But even so in their heart there was no belief in Him; for they believed that there were a number of gods. This may be clearly recognized from the golden calf which, while 
Moses delayed [to come down from the mountain], they venerated as their god, indeed as Jehovah<A name="fntext1"></a><A href="#fn1"><sup>a</sup></a>, and from the gods which after this they so often turned away to, as is evident from the historical 
narratives of the Word. From this evidence it becomes clear that they worshipped Jehovah solely on account of His miracles and not because He alone was God; and anyone who worships God solely on account 
of His miracles worships merely God's name, not God Himself, and turns away from that name as often as he does not attain his desires.  </p>
<p>The Israelite nation worshipped Jehovah, but only His name, 
see <a href="3732.htm">3732</a>(end), <a href="4299.htm">4299</a>, <a href="6877.htm">6877</a>.  At heart they were idolaters, <a href="4208.htm">4208</a>, <a href="4281.htm">4281</a>, <a href="4820.htm">4820</a>, <a href="5998.htm">5998</a>, <a href="6877.htm">6877</a>, <a href="7401.htm">7401</a>, <a href="8301.htm">8301</a>, <a href="8882.htm">8882</a>.  They were the worst nation, <a href="4314.htm">4314</a>, <a href="4316.htm">4316</a>, <a href="4317.htm">4317</a>, <a href="4444.htm">4444</a>, <a href="4503.htm">4503</a>, <a href="4570.htm">4570</a>, <a href="4751.htm">4751</a>, <a href="4815.htm">4815</a>, <a href="4820.htm">4820</a>, <a href="4832.htm">4832</a>, <a href="5057.htm">5057</a>, <a href="7248.htm">7248</a>, <a href="8819.htm">8819</a>, <a href="9320.htm">9320</a>; and in addition, <a href="10396.htm">10396</a>.  </p>
<p>From all this it now becomes clear what 'that this nation is Your people' means, namely that they alone were the ones with whom Jehovah resided, and 
so that they would be made pre-eminent over all other nations. But although this is what those words mean in the proximate sense, nevertheless in the internal sense they mean that the Divine, consequently 
the Church, would reside with them.

`Et vide quod populus Tuus gens haec':  quod significet quod soli in mundo apud quos Divinum quod super omnia, constat ex significatione `gentis Jehovae' quod sit ubi ipsum Divinum habitat, et in sensu 
spirituali, ubi Ecclesia Domini, nam omnes qui agnoscunt Dominum fide et amore simul sumpti sunt gens Jehovae; at filii Israelis eo tempore nihil cogitarunt de Ecclesia, sed solum de possessione terrae 
Canaanis, ac de eminentia super alios; et quia dictum erat Moschi quod nomen Dei illorum esset Jehovah, quod tamen prius nesciverunt, {1} Exod. iii 13, 14, et quia viderunt tanta miracula ab Ipso 
in Aegypto, (d)ac ad mare Suph, et in deserto, ideo agnoverunt Jehovam pro suo Deo; sed usque corde suo non crediderunt in Ipsum, crediderunt enim quod plures dii essent, ut satis constare potest ex 
vitulo aureo quem, tardante Mosche, pro suo deo, immo pro jehova adoraverunt; et postea ex diis, ad quos toties desciverunt, ut patet ex historicis Verbi; ex quibus constare potest quod Jehovam coluerint 
solum propter miracula, et non propterea quod Ipse solus Deus esset; et qui colit Deum solum propter miracula, is modo colit nomen Dei, et non Deum, ac desciscit ab illo quoties non potitur cupitis. 
 Quod gens Israelitica Jehovam solum quoad nomen coluerit, videatur n. 3732 fin., 4299, 6877, et quod corde idololatrae fuerint, n. 4208, 4281, 4820, 5998, 6877, 7401, 8301, 8882, et quod gens pessima 
fuerit, n. 4314, 4316, 4317, 4444, 4503, 4570, 4751, 4815, 4820, 4832, 5057, 7248, 8819, 9320, ac praeterea, 10396; ex his nunc constare potest quid significatur per `quod populus Tuus gens haec,' 
quod nempe illi soli essent apud quos Jehovah, et quod sic eminentiores fierent omnibus aliis gentibus.  At tametsi haec in sensu proximo significantur per illa verba, usque per eadem in sensu interno 
significatur quod Divinum apud illos esset, consequenter Ecclesia. @1 i videatur$ </p>
