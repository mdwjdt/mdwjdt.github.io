<h3 align="center" class="ired">属天的奥秘 第6423节</h3>
<h4 align="center"></h4><p><strong>6423.</strong>“约瑟要坐在他弓的力量里”表他通过教义真理的争战而得到保护或得以安全。这从“坐”和“弓”的含义清楚可知：“坐”是指得到保护或得以安全，因为“坐在他弓的力量里”的人得到保护，得以安全；“弓”是指教义（参看<a href="2686.htm">2686</a>，<a href="2709.htm">2709</a>节）。教义的力量是真理，因为教义没有真理，就没有力量。关于真理，即它拥有能力和力量，可参看前文（<a href="878.htm">878</a>e，<a href="3091.htm">3091</a>，<a href="4931.htm">4931</a>，<a href="4934.htm">4934</a>，<a href="4937.htm">4937</a>，<a href="6344.htm">6344</a>节）。真理之所以拥有力量，是因为良善通过真理行动；事实上，良善具有这样的性质：一切邪恶或虚假丝毫不能接近它；因此，地狱团伙的任何成员也不能接近它；当良善或一位处于良善的天使接近时，他们会逃得远远的。然而，为能与来自地狱、与人同在的这个团伙争战，以各种方式保护他，也保护刚从世界到来的灵人，同样保护那些在低地的人，良善通过真理行动，因为它以这种方式接近他们。<br />至于真理蕴含多少能力，我已经从我蒙允许在来世所看到的事物清楚明了。有一个灵人处于属世真理，因为他活在世上时就关心什么是对的；他经历了众多地狱，由此与我交谈，并描述了它们。他身上的能力和力量如此之大，以至于地狱灵根本无法骚扰他；所以他安全地从一个地狱转到另一个地狱，这对那些未处于真理的人来说，是根本不可能的事。由此可见，“约瑟要坐在他弓的力量里”表示他通过教义真理而得到保护或得以安全。真理的争战提供了这种保护，这一事实从前文可推知，在那里，经上说“弓箭手向他射箭，仇恨他”。</p>

And he shall sit in the strength of his bow. That this signifies that he is safe by means of the fighting truth of doctrine, is evident from the signification of "sitting," as being to be safe, for he 
who sits in the strength of his bow is safe; and from the signification of a "bow," as being doctrine (see n. 2686, 2709). The strength of doctrine is truth, for doctrine in which there is no truth 
is of no avail (that to truth belong power and strength, see above, n. 878, 3091, 4931, 4934, 4937, 6344). The reason why truth is strong, is that good acts through truth; for good is of such a nature 
that nothing of evil or of falsity can approach it, thus none of the infernal crew, who flee far away when good approaches, or an angel who is in good. But in order that good may fight with that crew 
which is with man from hell, and protect him in every way, and also protect the spirits who arrive from the world, and likewise those who are in the lower earth, it acts through truth, for in this way 
it can approach them. [2] How much power there is in truth has been made evident to me by what it has been given me to see in the other life. A certain spirit who was in natural truth, because during 
his life in this world he had been a just man, passed through a number of hells, and spoke with me from thence, and described them; he was in power and strength so great that the infernal spirits could 
not at all infest him, so that he passed safely from one hell into another, which is quite impossible for those who are not in truth. From all this it is evident that by "sitting in the strength 
of a bow" is signified to be safe by means of the truth of doctrine: that it is by truth fighting, follows from what goes before, where it is said that "the archers shoot at him and hate him." </p>

'And he will sit in the strength of his bow' means that he is protected by the militancy of the truth of doctrine. This is clear from the meaning of 'sitting' as being protected, for one who 'sits in 
the strength of his bow' is protected; and from the meaning of 'bow' as doctrine, dealt with in <a href="2686.htm">2686</a>, <a href="2709.htm">2709</a>. The strength that doctrine possesses resides in truth, for doctrine without truth in it has 
no strength. Regarding truth, that it possesses power and strength, see <a href="878.htm">878</a> (end), <a href="3091.htm">3091</a>, <a href="4931.htm">4931</a>, <a href="4934.htm">4934</a>, <a href="4977.htm">4977</a>, <a href="6344.htm">6344</a>. The reason why truth has 'strength' is that good acts by means of truth; for the nature 
of good is such that nothing at all evil or false can draw near it. Nor thus can any member of the hellish crew do so; that crew flees far away when good draws near, or when an angel governed by good 
does so. However, in order to fight that crew from hell present with a person and to protect him in every way, and in order also to protect spirits recently arrived from the world, as well as those 
on the lower earth, good acts by means of truth; for in that way it can draw near. </p>

<p><b>[2]</b>
 How much power is contained in truth has been made clear to me from things I have been allowed to see in the next 
life. A certain person governed by natural truth, because he had been concerned for what was right when he had lived in the world, passed through many hells, from which he talked to me and described 
them. Such power and strength were present in him that hellish spirits were not at all able to molest him, so that he was protected as he passed from one hell to another, which is something people 
who are not guided by truth cannot possibly do. From all this one may see that 'he will sit in the strength of his bow' means that he is protected by the truth of doctrine. The fact that the militancy 
of truth provides such protection follows from what has gone before, where it says that the archers shoot at him and hate him. </p>

</p><b>6423.</b>
`Et sedebit in valido arcus sui':  quod significet quod tutus a vero pugnante doctrinae, constat a significatione `sedere' quod sit tutus esse, qui enim `sedet in valido arcus', is tutus est; ex significatione 
`arcus' quod sit doctrina, de qua n. (x)2686, 2709; validum doctrinae est verum, doctrina enim in quo non verum, nihil valet; quod vero sit potentia et valor, videatur n. 878 fin., 3091,4931,4934,{1}4937, 
6344; causa quod verum sit `validum', est quia bonum agit per verum; bonum enim est tale ut ad illud nihil mali et falsi accedere possit, ita nec aliquis ex turba infernali; haec ad multam 
distantiam aufugit cum approximat bonum, seu angelus qui in bono est; ut autem bonum pugnare possit cum turba illa quae ab inferno apud hominem, ac tutari {2}illum omni modo, tum etiam tutari spiritus 
qui recentes ex mundo veniunt, {3}ut et illos qui in (t)terra inferiore sunt, agit bonum per verum, sic enim approximare potest.  [2]Quanta potentia insit vero, constare mihi potuit ab illis quae 
in altera vita videre datum est; quidam qui in vero naturali fuit, quia cum vixit in mundo, fuerat in justo, is plura inferna pertransivit et inde mihi locutus est ac illa descripsit; is in tali potentia 
et valore erat ut spiritus infernales ne hilum possent illum infestare, sic ut tutus ab uno in alterum transiret; quod nequaquam possunt facere qui non in vero sunt.  Ex his patet quod per `sedebit 
in valido arcus' significetur quod tutus a vero doctrinae; quod sit a vero pugnante, sequitur ab illis quae praecedunt, quod `jaculentur et odio habeant (c)eum sagittarii'. @1 i 4935$ @2 hominem$ @3 ac$ </p>
