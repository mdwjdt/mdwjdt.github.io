<h3 align="center" class="ired">属天的奥秘 第7200节</h3>
<h4 align="center"></h4><p><strong>7200.</strong>“我就记起我的约”表为了结合而从他们当中释放出来。这从“记起约”和“约”的含义清楚可知：“记起约”，就是与亚伯拉罕、以撒、雅各所立关于赐给他们迦南地的约，是指从在埃及的奴役所表示的侵扰中解救或释放出来，并被提入天堂；“约”是指结合（参看<a href="7195.htm">7195</a>节）。我们说为了结合，他们要被解救出来，并被提入天堂；事实上，与主的结合通过信和爱实现，因为信之真理和爱之良善从主发出，从主发出之物属于主，以致祂就是这些事物。因此，那些接受它们的人与主结合，而与主结合的人必被提到祂那里，也就是被提入天堂。</p>

<p align="center"><b>Potts(1905-1910) 7200</b></p><p><b>7200.</b>
And I have remembered my covenant. That this signifies that there was release from them because of conjunction, is evident from the signification of "remembering the covenant," namely, with Abraham, 
Isaac, and Jacob, to give them the land of Canaan, as being liberation or release from the infestations signified by the servitudes in Egypt, and an uplifting to heaven; and from the signification of 
"covenant," as being conjunction (see n. 7195). It is said that because of the conjunction they were to be liberated and uplifted into heaven; for conjunction with the Lord is effected through faith and 
love, because the truths of faith and the goods of love proceed from the Lord, and the things which proceed from Him are His, insomuch that they are Himself; and therefore they who receive these things 
are conjoined with Him; and they who are conjoined with Him cannot but be uplifted to Him, that is, into heaven. </p>

<p align="center"><b>Elliott(1983-1999) 7200</b></p><p><b>7200.</b>
'And I have remembered My covenant' means a release from them for the sake of the joining together. This is clear from the meaning of 'remembering the covenant' - with Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob, to give 
them the land of Canaan - as delivering or releasing from molestations, which are meant by the imposition of hard service in Egypt, and being raised to heaven; and from the meaning of 'covenant' as 
a joining together, dealt with above in <a href="7195.htm">7195</a>. It is said for the sake of the joining together that they are to be delivered and raised into heaven, for people come to be joined to the Lord through faith 
and love since truths which are the components of faith and forms of good which are the attributes of love emanate from the Lord, and the things that emanate from the Lord are so much His that He 
is those things. Those therefore who receive them are joined to Him, and those who are joined to Him cannot but be raised up to Him, that is, into heaven. </p>

</p><b>7200.</b>
`Et recordatus sum foederis Mei': quod significet quod exemptio ab illis propter conjunctionem, constat ex significatione `recordari foederis,' nempe `cum Abrahamo, Jischako, et Jacobo, ad dandum illis 
tertam Canaanem,' quod sit liberatio seu exemptio ab infestationibus, quae significantur per servitutes in Aegypto, et elevatio ad caelum; et ex significatione `foederis' quod sit conjunctio, de qua 
supra n. (x)7195.  Propter conjunctionem dicitur quod liberandi et elevandi in caelum, conjunctio enim {1}cum Domino fit per fidem et amorem, nam vera quae fidei et bona quae amoris procedunt a Domino, 
et quae procedunt ab Ipso sunt Ipsius adeo ut sint Ipse; qui itaque recipiunt illa conjunguntur Ipsi, et qui conjunguntur Ipsi non possunt aliter quam elevari ad Ipsum, hoc est, {2}in caelum. 	@1
