<p><strong>[NCE]193.</strong> But they perceived that they were behaving wrongly, as symbolized by the fact that their eyes were opened and that they heard Jehovah's voice (verses 7, 8). This remaining trace of perception, together with the leaf of the fig tree that they used in making loincloths for themselves (verse 7), the shame they displayed in hiding in the middle of the tree of the garden (verses 8, 9), and their acknowledgment and confession (verses 10, 11, 12, 13), makes it clear that they retained an earthly kind of goodness. </p>

But they perceived that they were in evil; from which remnant of perception, signified by their "eyes being opened" and by their "hearing the voice of Jehovah" (verses 7, 8), and from the fig-leaves 
of which they made themselves girdles (verse 7), and from their shame or hiding in the midst of the tree of the garden (verses 8, 9), as well as from their acknowledgment and confession (verses 10-13), 
it is evident that natural goodness still remained in them. </p>

But they perceived that they were under the influence of evil. From the residue of perception left to them, which is meant by the statements about their eyes being opened and their hearing the voice 
of Jehovah, verses 7, 8, and from the fig leaves with which they made themselves girdles, verse 7; also from their sense of shame or hiding themselves in the middle of the tree of the garden, verses 8, 9, as well as from their acknowledgement and confession, verses 10-13 it is evident that natural goodness remained with them.

Sed perceperunt quod in malo essent; ex quo perceptionis residuo, quod significatur per quod 'aperti sint oculi' et quod 'audiverint vocem Jehovae,' vers. 7, 8; et ex folio ficus quo fecerunt sibi cingula, 
vers. 7; tum ex pudore seu occultatione in medio arboris horti, vers. 8, 9; ut et ex agnitione et confessione, vers. 10-13, patet quod apud eos bonitas naturalis manserit. </p>
