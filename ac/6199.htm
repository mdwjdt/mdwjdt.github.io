<h4 align="center"></h4><p><strong>6199.</strong>另一个灵人也以为他自己就是我，并且如此确定以至于当他用我的母语与我交谈时，以为他用的是自己的语言；因为他说，这是他的语言。不过，他被指示，属于灵人的语言是完全不同的，它是所有语言当中的通用语言。他被指示，观念从这种语言流入我的母语；因此，灵人不是从自己说话，而是在我里面说话；这证明他们不仅进入那些属于世人的事物，还以为这些事物是他们自己的。</p>

Another spirit also supposed himself to be me, insomuch that when he talked with me In my native language he believed that he was speaking from his own, saying that the language was his. But it was shown 
that the language that belongs to spirits is entirely different, and that it is the universal language of all, and that from it ideas flowed into my native language, and thus they speak, not from 
themselves, but in me; and that this is a proof that they not only come into those things which are man's, but also that they suppose them to be their own. </p>

Another spirit too imagined that he was myself. He was so sure of it that he believed, when he talked to me in my native tongue, that he was using his own; for he said that that language was his. But 
he was shown that the language proper to spirits is entirely different and that it is the universal language of all languages. He was shown that ideas flow from that language into my own native tongue, 
so that spirits do not speak independently but within me, and that this serves to show that they not only enter what is man s but also suppose it to be their own. </p>

Alius spiritus etiam putabat quod is esset ego, usque adeo ut crederet cum loqueretur mecum lingua mea vernacula, quod is loqueretur ex sua, dicens quod illa lingua esset sua; sed ostensum quod lingua 
spiritibus propria prorsus alia sit, et quod sit lingua universalis omnium, et ex illa influant ideae in meam vernaculam et sic loquantur non ex se sed in me, et quod hoc indicium sit quod non solum 
in illa quae sunt hominis veniant, sed etiam quod putent illa esse sua. </p>
