<h3 align="center" class="ired">属天的奥秘 第6710节</h3>
<h4 align="center"></h4><p><strong>6710.</strong>正是爱使得人成为邻舍，每个人都照其爱的品质而为邻舍；这一点从那些陷入自我之爱的人身上很明显地看出来。这种人将那些最爱他的人视为邻舍；也就是说，他照着他们属于他，因而在他口袋或他自己里面的程度而视他们为邻舍。他会拥有这些人，亲吻他们，给他们好处，称之为自己的弟兄；事实上，他由于自己的邪恶会说，比起其他人，这些人更是邻舍。至于其余的人，他只在他们爱他自己的情况下视他们为邻舍。因此，他们对他的爱的质和量决定他看待他们的方式。这种人使得邻舍起源于他自己，因为爱是决定性因素。</p>

That it is the love which makes a man to be the neighbor, and that each person is the neighbor according to the quality of his love, is very manifest from those who are in the love of self. These acknowledge 
as the neighbor those who love them the most; that is, insofar as they are theirs; thus are in themselves. These they embrace, these they kiss, these they benefit, and these they call brethren; 
nay, because they are evil, they say that these are the neighbor more than others. All the rest they hold to be the neighbor according as these love them, thus according to the quality and the amount 
of the love. Much derive the origin of the neighbor from themselves, for it is the love that is the determinant. </p>

<p align="center"><b>Elliott(1983-1999) 6710</b></p><p><b>6710.</b>
Evidence that love is what makes a person the neighbour and that the character of a person's love determines what kind of neighbour he is, may be seen quite plainly in anyone who is governed by self-love. 
He recognizes as his neighbour those who love him most, that is, he does so to the extent that they are his own, thus are in his pocket. These he embraces, kisses, confers benefits on, and calls 
his brothers; indeed on account of his wickedness he says that these more than others are the neighbour. The rest he regards as the neighbour only inasmuch as he loves himself. Thus the kind and amount 
of love they feel for him determines the way he regards them. Such a person makes the origin of the neighbour reside in himself because love is what determines it. </p>

</p><b>6710.</b>
Quod amor sit qui facit ut proximus sit, et quod quisque proximus sit secundum quale ejus, patet manifeste ab illis qui in amore sui sunt; illi pro proximo agnoscunt qui se maxime amant, hoc est, quantum 
sunt sui, ita in se; hos amplectuntur, hos osculantur, {1} his benefaciunt, et hos fratres vocant; immo etiam quia mali sunt, hos dicunt proximum esse prae aliis; reliquos, sicut se amant, pro proximo 
habent; ita secundum quale et quantum amoris; tales a se originem proximi ducunt ex causa quia amor determinat. 	@1 i et$ </p>
