<h3 align="center" class="ired">属天的奥秘 第5128节</h3>
<h4 align="center"></h4><p><strong>5128.</strong>“做他酒政时”表这是这种感官印象的正常位置。这从“酒政”的含义清楚可知，“酒政”是指感官能力，也就是它们受心智的理解力部分支配的份（参看<a href="5077.htm">5077</a>，<a href="5082.htm">5082</a>节）；“做…时”表示“正常位置”。感官印象必须受理性观念支配，服从它们，这在前文早已论述过；但由于此处在内义上论述的主题就是这种支配和服从，所以必须说一说它的性质。<br />其感官已服从的人被称为理性的，其感官未服从的人被称为感官的。至于一个人是理性的，还是感官的，别人几乎看不出来；只有他自己能知道，不过，前提是他要检查自己的内层，也就是自己的意愿和思维。别人不可能从一个人的言行知道他是感官的，还是理性的，因为在言语里面的思维的生命和在行为里面的意愿的生命无法被任何肉体感官所察觉。人只听见他发出的声音，看见他身体的动作，连同驱使它们的情感，却分辨不出这情感是伪装的还是真实的。然而，在来世，那些处于良善的人既清楚察觉在一个人的言语里面的东西，也清楚察觉在他行为里面的东西，以及其中的生命源于何处。但即使在世上，也有某些迹象能使人在某种程度上推断出是感官受理性支配，还是理性受感官支配，或也可说，一个人是理性的，还是纯感官的。这些迹象如下：如果发现一个人陷入虚假原则，不肯被光照，变得更加明智，反而完全弃绝真理，毫无理性地扞卫虚假，那么这就是一个迹象，表明他是一个感官人，而非一个理性人。他的理性层被关闭了，以致它不容天堂之光进入。<br />那些被虚假说服的人尤其感官化，因为虚假的说服完全关闭理性层。陷入虚假原则是一回事，被虚假说服是另一回事。被虚假说服的人确有某种光在他们的属世层里面闪耀，但这光就像冬天里的光。在来世，当这光在他们中间闪耀时，它如雪一样亮白；但是，一旦天堂之光照在它上面，它就变暗，成了暗淡的光，并且照着他们信服的程度而变得如夜间那样黑暗。这些人活在世上时，这一点在他们身上也很明显，因为在世时，由于他们所信服的虚假导致的迟钝和愚昧，他们根本就看不到真理的价值，还嘲笑它们。在简单人看来，这种人有时给人一种印象，好像他们是理性的；因为他们能凭这雪白的冬光，运用巧妙的推理来证实虚假，使它们看似真理。比起其他人，这种说服更多地存在于许多有学问的人身上；因为他们利用三段论和哲学推理，最后用大量事实知识在自己里面确认虚假。在古人当中，这种人被称为知识树上的蛇（参看<a href="195.htm">195</a>-<a href="197.htm">197</a>节）；但如今，他们可被称作没有理性的感官人。<br />一个人是纯感官的，还是理性的，其主要标志在于他所过的生活，不是表现在其言行中的那种生活，而是在言行里面的那种生活。因为言语的生命源于思维，行为的生命源于意愿，这二者的生命皆源于意图或目的。因此，其言行中的意图或目的的性质决定了它们包含在自己里面的生命的性质；因为没有它们里面的生命，言语纯粹是声音，行为纯粹是动作。这种生命也是当人们说“死后生命仍继续”时的意思。如果一个人是理性的，他的言语就从正确的思维流出，他的行为则从正确的意愿流出；也就是说，他的言语是信仰的产物，他的行为是仁爱的产物。相反，如果一个人不是理性的，诚然，他做起事、说起话好像是一个理性人；但根本没有生命来自他的理性。因为邪恶的生活完全关闭了通向理性层的道路，或与理性层的交流，并使这个人成为纯属世的，或感官的。<br />有两样事物不仅关闭交流的道路，甚至剥夺人变得理性的能力，即：欺骗和亵渎。欺骗就像一剂微妙的毒药，侵染内层；亵渎则将虚假与真理、邪恶与良善混在一起。这二者彻底毁灭理性层，或说理性层因这二者而完全灭亡。每个人里面都有自幼年时就被主存储起来的良善与真理，这在圣言中被称为“余剩或余留”（参看<a href="468.htm">468</a>，<a href="530.htm">530</a>，<a href="560.htm">560</a>，<a href="561.htm">561</a>，<a href="661.htm">661</a>，<a href="1050.htm">1050</a>，<a href="1738.htm">1738</a>，<a href="1906.htm">1906</a>，<a href="2284.htm">2284</a>节）；正是这些余剩或余留被欺骗毒害，被亵渎混合到虚假与邪恶中。至于何为亵渎，可参看前文（<a href="593.htm">593</a>，<a href="1008.htm">1008</a>，<a href="1010.htm">1010</a>，<a href="1059.htm">1059</a>，<a href="1327.htm">1327</a>，<a href="1328.htm">1328</a>，<a href="2051.htm">2051</a>，<a href="2426.htm">2426</a>，<a href="3398.htm">3398</a>，<a href="3402.htm">3402</a>，<a href="3489.htm">3489</a>，<a href="3898.htm">3898</a>，<a href="4289.htm">4289</a>，<a href="4601.htm">4601</a>节）。所有这些迹象在某种程度上表明谁是理性人，谁是感官人。<br />当感官受理性层支配时，服务于形成人的最初想象的感官能力便接受经由天堂从主而来的光；同时它们被归入次序，以接受这光并与理性层对应或一致。一旦它们处于这种状态，感官印象就不再是一个阻止真理被承认或看见的障碍，因为不与真理一致的感官印象立刻被移除，而一致的则被接受。在中心的感官印象可以说朝天堂被提升，在周边的可以说向下垂。在中心的从理性层接受光，当在来世显为可见时，它们看似闪闪发光的小星星，所发的光逐渐减弱，一直发散到周边。这就是当理性层掌权，感官受它支配时，属世或感官形像被带入的那种形式。这就是当人正在重生，由此处于看见并承认丰盛真理的状态时所发生的情形。但是，当理性层受感官支配时，相反的情形就会发生；因为在这种情况下，虚假在中心，而真理在周边。在中心的虚假居于某种光中；然而，这是一种昏昧、欺骗的低劣之光，就像是从炭火发出的那种。来自地狱的四面八方的光都流入此光。这种低劣的光就是那被称为黑暗的，因为一旦有天堂来的光流入它，它就变为黑暗。</p>

When thou wast his butler. That this signifies as is usual with sensuous things of this kind, is evident from the signification of a "butler," as being sensuous things, or that portion of them which 
is subject to the intellectual part (see n. 5077, 5082); its being "as is usual" with them is signified by "when thou wast." That sensuous things ought to be subject and subordinate to rational things 
has already been treated of in the preceding pages; and as this subjection and subordination is here treated of in the internal sense, it still remains to show how the case is in regard to it. 
 </p>
<p>[2] The 
man in whom sensuous things are in subjection is called rational, but the man in whom they are not in subjection is called sensuous; but whether a man is rational or sensuous can scarcely be discerned 
by others; but it can be discerned by himself if he explores his interiors, that is, his will and his thought. Whether a man is sensuous or rational cannot be known by others from his speech or from 
his actions; for the life of the thought which is in the speech, and the life of the will which is in the actions, do not appear to any bodily sense. Only the sound is heard and the gesture seen together 
with their affection, and it is not distinguished whether the affection is pretended or real; but in the other life this is distinctly perceived by those who are in good, both as to what is in 
the speech and what is in the actions; thus what is the quality of the life, and also from what source the life therein is derived. In this world also there are some signs from which it can in some measure 
be inferred whether sensuous things are subject to the rational, or the rational to sensuous things, or what is the same, whether a man is rational or merely sensuous. The signs are these. If it 
is observed that a man is in principles of falsity, and does not suffer himself to be enlightened, but entirely rejects truths, and without reason obstinately defends falsities, this is a sign that he 
is a sensuous man, and not a rational, the rational being closed in him, so that it does not admit the light of heaven.  
 </p>
<p>[3] Still more sensuous are those who are in the persuasion of falsity, because 
the persuasion of falsity totally closes the rational. It is one thing to be in principles of falsity, and another to be in the persuasion of falsity. They who are in the persuasion of falsity have 
some light in their natural, but it is a light like that of winter. In the other life this light appears with them white like snow; but as soon as the heavenly light falls into it, it is darkened, and 
becomes dark like night in accordance with the degree and quality of the persuasion. This is also evident with them while they live in the world, for they cannot then see anything whatever of truth; 
nay, in consequence of the obscure or benighted influence of their falsity, truths to them are as things of naught, and they also ridicule them. To the simple such persons sometimes appear as if they 
were rational; for by means of that snowy wintry light they can through reasonings so dexterously confirm falsities, that these appear like truths. In such persuasion are many of the learned, more than 
the rest of mankind; for they have confirmed falsities in themselves by syllogistic and philosophical reasonings, and finally by many acquired knowledges. Among the ancients such men were called serpents 
of the tree of knowledge (see n. 195-197); but at this day they may be called interior sensuous men who have no rational.  
 </p>
<p>[4] The principal sign whether a man is merely sensuous or is rational, 
is from his life; not such as appears in his speech and his works, but such as it is within these; for the life of the speech is from the thought, and the life of the works is from the will, and that 
of both is from the intention or end. Such therefore as is the intention or end within the speech and the works, such is the life; for speech without interior life is mere sound, and works without 
interior life are mere movements. This is the life which is meant when it is said that "the life remains after death." If a man is rational, he speaks from thinking well, and acts from willing well, 
that is, he speaks from faith and acts from charity; but if a man is not rational, he may then indeed begin to act, and also to speak, as a rational man; but still there is nothing of life from the rational 
in him; for a life of evil closes up every way or communication with the rational, and causes the man to be merely natural and sensuous. 
 </p>
<p>[5] There are two things which not only close up the way 
of communication, but even deprive a man of the capacity of ever becoming rational - deceit and profanation. Deceit is like a subtle poison which infects the interiors, and profanation mixes falsities 
with truths and evils with goods: through these two the rational wholly perishes. There are in every man gods and truths from the Lord stored up from infancy, which in the Word are called "remains" 
(see n. 468, 530, 560, 561, 661, 1050, 1738, 1906, 2284); these remains are infected by deceit, and are mixed up by profanation (what profanation is may be seen above, n. 593, 1008, 1010, 1059, 1327, 
1328, 2051, 2426, 3398, 3402, 3489, 3898, 4289, 4601). From these signs it may in some measure be known who is a rational, and who a sensuous man.  [6] When sensuous things are subject to the rational, 
then the sensuous things from which man's first imagination is formed, are enlightened by the light which comes through heaven from the Lord, and are also disposed into order so as to receive the 
light and correspond. When they are in this state, sensuous things no longer stand in the way of truths being acknowledged and seen, those which disagree being instantly removed, and those which agree 
being accepted. Those which agree are then as it were in the center, and those which disagree are in the circumference; those which are in the center are as it were lifted up toward heaven, and those 
which are in the circumference as it were hang downward. Those which are in the center receive light through the rational, and when they are presented to view in the other life they are seen as little 
stars which gleam and shed light round about even to the circumference, with a gradual diminution. Into such a form are natural and sensuous things disposed when the rational has dominion, and sensuous 
things are in subjection. This takes place while the man is being regenerated, and thereby he is in a state of seeing and acknowledging truths in their full extent. But when the rational is subject 
to sensuous things, the contrary comes to pass; for falsities are in the middle, or in the center, and truths are in the circumference. The things which are in the center are in a certain light, but 
it is a fatuous light, or such as arises from a coal fire, into which flows a light on all sides from hell. This is the light which is called darkness, for as soon as any light from heaven flows into 
it, it is turned into darkness. </p>

<p align="center"><b>Elliott(1983-1999) 5128</b></p><p><b>5128.</b>
'When you were his cupbearer' means as is the normal position for sensory impressions of this kind. This is clear from the meaning of 'cupbearer' as the powers of the senses, that is, those of them that 
are subject to the understanding part of the mind, dealt with in <a href="5077.htm">5077</a>, <a href="5082.htm">5082</a> - the normal position being meant by the expression 'when you were'. The need for sensory impressions to be subject and 
subordinate to rational ideas has been referred to already in what has gone before; but since the subjection and subordination of them is the subject here in the internal sense, something more must be 
said about the nature of this. </p>
<p></p>
<p><b>[2]</b>
 The person with whom the senses have been made subject is called a rational person, but a person with whom they have not is called one ruled by his senses. But whether 
a person is rational or whether he is one ruled by his senses is scarcely discernible by others; only the individual himself can know, if he examines himself inwardly, that is, if he examines what 
he wills and what he thinks. Others cannot know from a person's speech whether he is one ruled by his senses or whether he is a rational person, nor can they know it from his actions, because the 
life of his thought held within his speech and the life of his will held within his actions cannot be perceived by any of the physical senses. These hear merely the sound he utters, or they see the movement 
made by his body together with the affection that impels him to make it. One cannot tell whether this affection is artificial or genuine. In the next life however those who are governed by good 
perceive clearly both what is held within a person's speech and what is held within his actions, and so perceive the nature of the life within them and where that life has its origin. Yet even in the 
world several indications exist which enable one to deduce to some extent whether the senses are subject to the rational, or the rational to the senses; or what amounts to the same, whether a person 
is rational or ruled solely by his senses. Those indications are as follows: If one notices that a person who makes false assumptions is not ready to become more enlightened but casts truths altogether 
aside, dispenses with reason, and obstinately defends falsities, this is an indication that he is ruled by his senses and is not a rational person. His rational is closed, so that it does not let in 
the light of heaven. </p>
<p></p>
<p><b>[3]</b>
 Ruled even more by their senses are those who are quite convinced by what is false, for such a conviction closes the rational altogether. It is one thing to make false assumptions, 
another to be convinced by what is false. Those convinced by what is false do have some light shining within their natural, but this is like the light in winter. When it shines among them in 
the next life that light is as bright as snow; but as soon as the light of heaven falls on it, it becomes a dull light, the degree and nature of their conviction making it dark as night. The same is 
also evident in these people while they are living in the world, for during that time they are unable to see the faintest glimmer of truth. Indeed because of the dullness and benightedness due to the 
falsity of which they are convinced, they see no value at all in truths and laugh at them. To the simple those people sometimes give the impression that they are rational, for by means of that snowy-white 
wintry light they are able to employ clever reasonings to substantiate falsities and make them look like truths. This kind of conviction exists in many of the learned, more than in every other kind 
of person, for they have used syllogistic and philosophical reasonings, and finally much factual knowledge to become firmly convinced by falsities. Among the ancients such people were called serpents 
belonging to the tree of knowledge, <a href="195.htm">195</a>-<a href="197.htm">197</a>, but today they may be called those who are ruled inwardly by their senses and are devoid of true rationality. </p>
<p></p>
<p><b>[4]</b>
 The main indication that shows whether 
someone is ruled wholly by his senses or whether he is a rational person exists in the life he leads. By this one does not mean the kind of life that is evident in his words and deeds but the kind 
that is held inwardly in these. For the source of the life within his words is his thought, and the source of the life within his deeds is his will, both having their origin in his intentions or end 
in view. The nature therefore of the intentions or end in view present within his words and deeds determines the nature of the life they hold within them, for without the life within them words are mere 
sounds, while deeds are mere motions. This kind of life is also what is meant when one speaks of life continuing after death. If a person is rational his words flow from right thinking and his deeds 
from right willing; that is, his words are a product of faith and his deeds a product of charity. But if a person is not rational he can, it is true, make a pretence of acting as one who is rational, 
and likewise of speaking as one who is such; but no life at all is coming from his rational. For a life of evil closes entirely the path to or communication with the rational, which causes him to be 
a merely natural person or one ruled by his senses. </p>
<p></p>
<p><b>[5]</b>
 There are two things which not only close that path of communication but also rob a person of the ability ever to become rational - deceit and 
profanation. Deceit is like a subtle poison which affects the inward parts, while profanation is that which mixes up falsities with truths and evils with forms of good. The two completely destroy the 
rational. Present with everyone there are forms of good and truth which have been stored away by the Lord since earliest childhood. In the Word these forms of good and truth are called remnants, regarding 
which see <a href="468.htm">468</a>, <a href="530.htm">530</a>, <a href="560.htm">560</a>, <a href="561.htm">561</a>, <a href="661.htm">661</a>, <a href="1050.htm">1050</a>, <a href="1738.htm">1738</a>, <a href="1906.htm">1906</a>, <a href="2284.htm">2284</a>; and it is these remnants that deceit poisons and that profanation mixes up with falsities and evils. For what profanation is, see <a href="593.htm">593</a>, <a href="1008.htm">1008</a>, <a href="1010.htm">1010</a>, <a href="1059.htm">1059</a>, <a href="1327.htm">1327</a>, <a href="1328.htm">1328</a>, <a href="2051.htm">2051</a>, <a href="2426.htm">2426</a>, <a href="3398.htm">3398</a>, <a href="3402.htm">3402</a>, <a href="3489.htm">3489</a>, <a href="3898.htm">3898</a>, <a href="4289.htm">4289</a>, <a href="4601.htm">4601</a>. All these indications show to some extent who a rational person is and who one ruled by his senses is. </p>
<p></p>
<p><b>[6]</b>
 When the senses 
have become subject to the rational, the sensory powers that serve to form a person's first mental images receive light which comes through heaven from the Lord; they are at the same time brought 
into a state of order that enables them to receive that light and agree with the rational. Once they exist in this condition sensory impressions are no longer a barrier that prevents truths from being 
either acknowledged or seen, for those that are not in keeping with truths are instantly set aside, while those which are in keeping are accepted. Those that are in keeping are now so to speak at the 
centre and those that are not are on the fringes. Those at the centre are so to speak raised up towards heaven, while those on the fringes are hanging downwards. Those at the centre receive light from 
the rational, and when they are manifested visually in the next life they look like small glittering stars which radiate light, gradually decreasing, out to the fringes. This is the kind of form that 
natural or sensory images are being brought into when the rational has dominion and the senses exist subject to it. This is what happens to a person while he is being regenerated, bringing him as 
a consequence into a state in which truths can be seen and acknowledged by him in abundance. But when the rational is subject to the senses the opposite happens, for in this case falsities are in the 
middle or at the centre and truths are on the fringes. The falsities at the centre dwell in a certain kind of light, which however is an inferior and deceptive one, like that emitted by a coal fire. Into 
this there is flowing light on every side from hell. This inferior light is that which is called darkness, for as soon as any light from heaven flows into it, it is converted into darkness. </p>

`Quo fuisti pincerna illius':  quod significet sicut sensuali illius generis solent, constat ex significatione `pincernae' quod sin sensualia, seu illa sensualium quae subjecta sunt parti intellectuali 
de qua n. 5077, 5082; quod sint sicut solent, significatur per `quo fuisti.' Quod sensualia erunt et subordinata rationalibus, in praecedentibus nunc actum est; et quia de subjectione et subordinatione 
illa in sensu interno hic agitur, adhuc dicendum quomodo cum illa re se habet:  [2] homo apud quem subjecta sunt sensualia, vocatur rationalis, at apud quem non subjecta sunt, vocatur sensualis; 
sed num homo rationalis sit, vel num sensualis, aegre discerni potest ab aliis, sed ab ipso si explorat sua interiora, hoc est, suum velle et suum cogitare; num homo sensualis sit vel rationalis 
ab aliis non sciri potest ex loquela, nec ab actione, nam {1}vita cogitationis quae est in loquela et vita voluntatis quae est in actione, non apparent ad aliquem sensum corporis; auditur modo 
sonus et videtur gestus cum affectione, quae num sit simulata vel num vera, non dignoscitur; </p>
<p>sed in altera vita ab illis qui in bono sunt, distincte percipitur tam quid in loquela quam quid in 
actione, ita qualis vita, et quoque unde vita in illis; at in mundo usque aliquot indicia dantur, ex quibus aliquatenus concludi potest num sensualia subjecta sint rationali, vel num rationale sensualibus, 
seu quod idem, num homo rationalis sit, vel num solum sensualis; indicia haec sunt:  si animadvertitur quod homo in principiis falsi sit et non patitur se illustrari, sed prorsus rejicit vera 
et absque ratione contumaciter falsa defendit, indicium est quod sensualis homo sit, et non rationalis; occlusum est illi rationale ut non admittat lucem caeli.  [3] Adhuc magis sensuales sunt 
qui in persuasione falsi sunt, persuasio enim falsi prorsus occludit rationale; aliud est in principiis falsi esse, et aliud in persuasione falsi; qui in persuasione falsi sunt, habent in naturali 
suo aliquam lucem, sed talem qualis est lux hiemalis; haec lux apparet in altera vita apud illos nivea, sed ut primum lux caelestis in illam incidit, obscuratur, et secundum persuasionis gradum et 
{2} quale fit opaca instar noctis; hoc quoque patet ab illis cum vivunt in mundo, tunc enim prorsus nihil veri possunt videre, immo ex obscuro seu nocturno falsi eorum, vera illis sicut nihili sunt, 
et quoque ea irrident; tales coram simplicibus apparent quandoque sicut rationales, nam media luce illa nivea hiemali per ratiocinia dextre confirmare possunt falsa usque ut appareant sicut vera; 
in persuasione tali plus quam reliqui sunt plures ex eruditis, confirmarunt enim apud se falsa per syllogistica et {3} philosophica, et demum per plura scientifica; </p>
<p>tales apud antiquos dicti sunt 
serpentes arboris scientiae, n. 195- </p>
<p>197; sed hodie dici queunt interiores sensuales absque rationali.  [4] Indicium num homo solum sensualis sit, vel num rationalis, est imprimis ex vita ejus; per 
vitam non intelligitur qualis illa apparet in sermone et in operibus; sed qualis illa est in sermone et in operibus; vita enim sermonis est a cogitatione, et vita operum est a voluntate, utraque 
ab intentione seu fine; qualis itaque intentio seu finis est in sermone et in operibus, talis est vita, nam sermo absque interiore vita est modo sonus, et opera absque interiore vita est solum motus, 
illa vita est quae intelligitur cum dicitur quod vita maneat {4} post mortem; si homo rationalis est, ex bene cogitare loquitur et ex bene velle agit, hoc est, ex fide loquitur et ex charitate agit; 
at si homo non rationalis est, tunc quidem potest simulate agere sicut rationalis et similiter loqui, sed usque nihil vitae ex rationali inest; vita mali enim occludit omnem viam seu communicationem 
cum rationali, et facit ut mere naturalis et sensualis sit.  [5] Sunt duo quae non solum occludunt communicationis viam, sed etiam deprivant hominem facultate ut usquam rationalis fieri possit, 
est dolus et est profanatio; dolus est instar subtilis veneni quod infectat interiora; et profanatio est quae commiscet falsa veris et mala bonis; ex illis binis prorsus perit rationale; sunt {5} 
apud unumquemvis hominem bona et vera a Domino recondita ab infantia, quae bona et vera in Verbo `reliquiae' vocantur, de quibus videatur n. 468, 530, 560, 561, {6} 661, 1050, 1738, 1906, 2284, 
has {7} infectat dolus et commiscet profanatio; quid profanatio, videatur n. 593, 1008, 1010, 1059, 1327, 1328, 2051, 2426, 3398, 3402, 3489, 3898, 4289,4601. Ex his indiciis aliquatenus potest sciri 
quis rationalis homo est et quis sensualis,{8}.  [6] Cum sensualia subjecta sunt rationali, tunc sensualia, ex quibus imaginatio prima hominis, illustrantur a luce quae per caelum a Domino venit, 
et quoque tunc sensualia disponuntur in ordinem, ut recipiant lucem utque correspondeant; sensualia cum in illo statu sunt, non obstant amplius quin vera et agnoscantur et videantur, removentur ilico quae 
dissentiunt, et acceptantur quae consentiunt; quae consentiunt, tunc quasi in centris sunt, et quae dissentiunt in peripheriis; quae in centris, quasi attolluntur versus caelum, et quae
