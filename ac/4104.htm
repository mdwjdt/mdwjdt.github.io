<h3 align="center" class="ired">属天的奥秘 第4104节</h3>
<h4 align="center"></h4><p><strong>4104.</strong>“把他的儿子和女眷都扶上骆驼”表真理和对它们的情感之提升，以及它们在一般事物里面的有序排列。这从“儿子”、“女眷”和“骆驼”的含义清楚可知：“儿子”是指真理（参看<a href="489.htm">489</a>，<a href="491.htm">491</a>，<a href="533.htm">533</a>，<a href="1147.htm">1147</a>，<a href="2623.htm">2623</a>节）；“女眷”，就是此处的拉结和利亚，以及使女，是指对真理、对认知和对记忆知识的情感，如前所示；“骆驼”是指属世层中一般的记忆知识（参看<a href="3048.htm">3048</a>，<a href="3071.htm">3071</a>，<a href="3143.htm">3143</a>，<a href="3145.htm">3145</a>节）。<br />不知道有关代表和对应情况的人无法相信“把他的儿子和女眷都扶上骆驼”这句话具有这种含义。在他看来，它们似乎太过遥远，以至于不会吸纳并包含任何灵义在里面；因为他思想的是儿子，女眷和骆驼。但以属灵方式看到并感知所有这类事物的天使不会思想儿子，一提到儿子，他们想到的是真理；他们也不思想女眷，一提到女眷，他们想到的是对真理、对认知，以及对记忆知识的情感；他们同样不思想骆驼，而是思想属世层里面的一般事物。因为这就是一个事物与另一个事物之间的对应关系，这就是天使的思维方式。值得注意的是，这也是内在属灵人活在肉身时的思维方式，尽管外在人完全没有意识到这一点。由于同样的原因，已重生之人死后进入同样的思维方式，并能与天使一起思考和交谈，并且根本不用教；如果他原来没有这种内在思维，这是绝无可能的事。思维具有这样的特性是由于属世之物与属灵之物的对应关系。由此可见，圣言的字义虽是属世的，但仍包含属灵之物在自己及其每一个细节里面，即包含属于内在或属灵思维和由此衍生的言语，换句话说，就是诸如存在于天使的思维和言语中的那类事物。<br />至于真理和对它们的情感之提升，以及它们在一般事物里面的有序排列，情况是这样：当永生和主国度的事物被认为比肉身生命和尘世国度中的事物更重要时，真理和情感就被提升。当人承认前者是首先和最重要的，后者是次要和从属的时，他所知道的真理，以及他对这些真理的情感就被提升。因为此人在何等程度上被带入含有聪明智慧在里面的天堂之光，属于尘世之光的事物对他来说，就在何等程度上变成形像，可以说成为镜子，他在这镜中看到属于天堂之光的事物。当此人视肉身生命和尘世国度的事物比永生和主国度的事物还要重要时，情况刚好相反。如当他以为后者不存在，因为他没有看见它们，也没有人从那里来报告有关它们的事时；以及当他以为即便它们真的存在，他也不会比别人更糟糕时；并且当他确认这些想法，过着世俗的生活，完全鄙视仁与信时的情形。对这种人来说，真理和对它们的情感没有被提升，而是要么被窒息，要么被弃绝，要么被败坏。因为他居于属世之光，而天堂之光丝毫不流入属世之光。由此明显可知，真理和对它们的情感之提升是什么意思。<br />至于这些真理和情感在一般事物里面的有序排列，这是一个必然的结果。事实上，人越认为天堂事物比尘世事物重要，其属世层里面的事物就越照着天堂的状态按秩序被排列，以致它们在属世层中看上去如同天堂事物的形像和镜子，如前所述，因为它们是相对应的代表。正是目的实现这种有序排列，也就是说，主通过此人所关注的目的实现这种有序排列。因为有三样事物依次而来，即目的，原因和结果。目的产生原因，并通过原因产生结果。因此，目的如何，所产生的原因就如何，出于这些原因的结果就如何。对人来说，目的构成至内在的事物；原因构成中间或居间事物；结果构成终级事物，被称为末后或终级目的。结果还构成被称为一般性的事物。由此可见，在一般事物里面的排列是什么意思，即：当永生和主国度的事物被视为目的时，一切中间或居间的目的或原因，和一切终极目的或结果就照着这目的本身按秩序被排列。这一切都在属世层里面，因为结果在那里，或也可说，一般事物在那里。<br />凡有点判断力，并且对这个问题给予思考的成年人都能意识到，他活在两个国度，即属灵国度和属世国度。他还能意识到，属灵国度是内在，属世国度是外在；因而意识到他能认为这个国度比另一个重要，也就是说，能更关注这个国度而不是那一个；因而他视之为目的，或认为更重要的那一个向他掌权，或占据主导地位。因此，如果他以属灵国度，也就是构成属灵国度的事物为目的，并认为属灵国度比属世国度更重要，那么，他就会承认对主之爱和对邻之仁，以及随之确认这爱与信，被称为信之真理的一切观念是首先和最重要的；因为这些属于该国度。在这种情况下，其属世层里面的一切事物就会照着该国度的事物而被有序分布和排列，以便它们能服从和顺从。但当人以属世国度，也就是它所包含的事物为目的，并认为它们更重要时，他就会毁灭一切对主之爱和对邻之仁，以及一切信。事实上，他会发展到视这些事物一文不值的地步；反而使尘世之爱和自我之爱，及其所属一切成为最重要的。在这种情况下，其属世层里面的一切事物便照着这些目的而被排列，从而与天堂事物完全对立。他以这种方式将地狱带到自己里面。视为目的就是去爱，因为一切目的属于爱，凡他所爱的，他便视为目的。 </p>

And lifted his sons and his women upon the camels. That this signifies the elevation of truths and of the affections of them, and their orderly arrangement in generals, is evident from the signification 
of "sons," as being truths (see n. 489, 491, 533, 1147, 2623); from the signification of "women," here Rachel and Leah and also the handmaids, as being the affections of truth, of knowledges, and 
of memory-knowledges, as shown before; and from the signification of "camels," as being general memory-knowledges in the natural (see n. 3048, 3071, 3143, 3145).  [2] He who does not know how the case 
is with representations and correspondences, cannot believe that these words, "he lifted his sons and his women upon the camels," have such a signification; for they appear to him too remote from such 
matters to involve and contain within themselves any such spiritual meaning, for he thinks about sons, women, and camels. But the angels, who see and perceive all such things spiritually, do not think 
about sons, but when "sons" are mentioned they think of truths; nor do they think about women, but when "women" are mentioned they think of the affections of truth, of knowledges, and of memory-knowledges; 
nor do they think about camels, but instead they think of general things in the natural. For such is the correspondence of all these things; and such is angelic thought; and wonderful to say 
such is the thought of the internal spiritual man while living in the body, although the external man is entirely unaware of it. For the same reason, when a man who has been regenerated dies, he comes 
into the like thought, and can think and speak with angels, and this without instruction; which would be quite impossible unless he had had such interior thought. That the thought is of this character 
comes from the correspondence of natural and spiritual things; and from this it is evident that although the literal sense of the Word is natural, it nevertheless contains within itself and every particular 
of it spiritual things; that is, such as are of the interior or spiritual thought and the derivative speech; or in other words, such as exist in the thought and speech of the angels.  [3] As 
regards the elevation of truths and of the affections of them, and their orderly arrangement in generals, the case is this: The truths and the affections are elevated when the things of eternal life 
and of the Lord's kingdom are set before those which belong to life in the body and to the kingdom of the world. When a man acknowledges the former as the principal and primary, and the latter as the 
instrumental and secondary, then with him truths and the affections of them are elevated; for in the same proportion the man is carried away into the light of heaven, within which there are intelligence 
and wisdom; and in the same proportion the things which are of the light of the world become to him images and as it were mirrors in which he sees the things of the light of heaven. The contrary happens 
when the man sets the things of the life of the body and of the kingdom of the world before those of eternal life and the Lord's kingdom; as when he believes that the latter have no existence because 
he does not see, them, and because no one has come from there and made them known; and also when he believes that if they do exist, nothing worse will happen to him than to others; and when he 
confirms himself in these ideas, and lives the life of the world, and utterly despises charity and faith. With such a man, truths and the affections of them are not elevated, but are either suffocated, 
or rejected, or perverted; for he is in natural light, into which nothing of heavenly light inflows. From all this it is evident what is meant by the elevation of truths and of the affections of them. [4] 
As regards their orderly arrangement in generals, this is a necessary consequence; for insofar as a man sets heavenly things before worldly ones, so far are the things in his natural arranged 
in order according to the state of heaven, so that as before said they appear therein as images and mirrors of heavenly things, for they are corresponding representatives. It is the ends that effect the 
arrangement into order, that is, the Lord through the ends in the man. For there are three things that follow in order, namely, ends, causes, and effects. Ends produce causes, and through causes, effects. 
Such therefore as are the ends, such come forth the consequent causes, and such the consequent effects. Ends are the inmost things with man; causes are middle or mediates, and are called mediate 
ends; and effects are ultimates, and are called last or ultimate ends. Effects are also what are called generals. From all this it is evident in what consists orderly arrangement in generals, namely, 
that when the things of eternal life and of the Lord's kingdom are regarded as the end, all the middle ends or causes, and all the ultimate ends or effects, are arranged in order in accordance with 
the end itself; and this in the natural, because the effects are there; or what is the same, the generals are there.  [5] Every man of adult age who possesses any judgment, and will give the matter 
any consideration, is able to know that he is in two kingdoms, namely, in a spiritual kingdom and in a natural kingdom; and also that the spiritual kingdom is interior, and the natural kingdom exterior; 
and consequently that he can set one before the other, that is, he can regard one as the end in preference to the other; and thus that the one which he regards as his end, or prefers, rules with him. 
If therefore he regards the spiritual kingdom as his end, and prefers it (that is, the things that belong to this kingdom), he then acknowledges as the principal and primary, love to the Lord and charity 
toward the neighbor, and consequently all things that confirm this love and charity, and are said to be of faith; for these belong to that kingdom; and in this case all things in his natural are 
arranged and set in order in accordance therewith, in order that they may be subservient and obedient. But when a man has as his end and sets first the natural kingdom (that is, the things it contains), 
he then extinguishes all that is of love to the Lord and of charity toward the neighbor, and all that is of faith, insomuch that he makes them of no account whatever; but makes the love of the world 
and of self, and all that belongs thereto, to be everything. When this is the case, all things in his natural are arranged in order in accordance with these ends, thus in utter contrariety to the 
things of heaven; and in this way he makes hell in himself. To regard as an end is to love, for every end is of the love, because whatever is loved is regarded as the end. </p>

<p align="center"><b>Elliott(1983-1999) 4104</b></p><p><b>4104.</b>
'And set his sons and his womenfolk on camels' means a raising up of truths and of affections for these, and the arrangement of them within things that are general. This is clear from the meaning of 
'sons' as truths, dealt with in <a href="489.htm">489</a>, <a href="491.htm">491</a>,<a href="533.htm">533</a>, <a href="1147.htm">1147</a>, <a href="2623.htm">2623</a>; from the meaning of 'womenfolk', who in this case are Rachel and Leah, and also their servant-girls, as affections for truth, for cognitions, 
and for facts, dealt with already; and from the meaning of 'camels' as general facts within the natural, dealt with in <a href="3048.htm">3048</a>, <a href="3071.htm">3071</a>, <a href="3143.htm">3143</a>, <a href="3145.htm">3145</a>. </p>
<p></p>
<p><b>[2]</b>
 Anyone who does not have some knowledge of representations 
and correspondences is incapable of believing that the words 'he set his sons and his womenfolk on camels' mean such things. To him they seem too remote to incorporate and contain within them 
that which is spiritual; for he thinks about sons, womenfolk, and camels. But the angels, who see and perceive all such things in a spiritual manner, do not think of sons but of truths when 'sons' are 
mentioned; they do not think of womenfolk but of affections for truth, cognitions, and facts when 'womenfolk' are mentioned; nor do they think of camels but of things that are general within the natural 
when these are mentioned. For such is the correspondence between the one thing and the other, and such is the way in which angels think. And what is remarkable, it is also the way in which the internal 
spiritual man thinks while living in the body, though the external man is totally unaware of it. For the same reason when a person who has been regenerated dies he enters into a similar manner 
of thinking and is able to think with and talk to angels. And this he does without being taught to do so, something that would never have been possible if his interior thought had not been such. The fact 
that it is such is due to the correspondence of natural things with spiritual. From this it may been seen that although the literal sense of the Word is natural it nevertheless contains spiritual 
things within it, and in every single part, that is, it contains the kind of things that belong to thought and therefore to interior or spiritual language, such as angels employ. </p>
<p></p>
<p><b>[3]</b>
 With regard to 
the raising up of truths and of the affections for these, and the arrangement of them within things that are general, truths and affections are raised up when the things of eternal life and of the Lord's 
kingdom are thought to be more important than those of life in the body and of the kingdom of this world. When a person acknowledges the former to be first and foremost, and the latter to be secondary 
and subordinate, the truths he knows and his affections for them are raised up. For as is his acknowledgement so in the same measure is that person conveyed into the light of heaven, which light 
holds intelligence and wisdom within it, and so also in the same measure do things belonging to the light of this world become for him images and so to speak mirrors in which he sees the things belonging 
to the light of heaven. The contrary takes place when he thinks the things of the life of the body and of the kingdom of this world to be more important than those of eternal life and of the Lord's 
kingdom. He does this when he believes that the latter do not exist because he does not see them and because nobody has come from there and given an account of them - or if he does believe that they 
may exist, nothing worse will happen to him than to others - and in so believing confirms himself in these ideas, leads a worldly life, and despises charity and faith altogether. With such a person 
truths and the affections for them are not raised up but are either smothered, or rejected, or perverted. For he dwells in natural light into which no heavenly light at all flows in. This shows what is 
meant by a raising up of truths and of affections for them. </p>
<p></p>
<p><b>[4]</b>
 As for the arrangement of these truths and affections within things that are general, this is the inevitable consequence; for insofar 
as a person thinks heavenly things are more important than worldly ones, things within his natural are arranged into an order in keeping with the state of heaven. As a result they are seen in the natural, 
as has been stated, as images and mirrors of heavenly things, for they are representatives that correspond. It is the ends in view which effect the arranging, that is, the Lord effects it by means 
of the ends which the person has in view. For there are three things which follow in order ends, causes, and effects. Ends bring about causes, and by means of causes bring about effects. As is the 
nature of the ends therefore so is that of the emanating causes, and from these that of the effects. Ends constitute the inmost things with man; causes constitute the intermediate things and are called 
the intermediate ends; and effects constitute the ultimate things and are called the ultimate ends. Effects also constitute the things which are termed general. From this one may see what is meant 
by an arrangement within things that are general, namely this: When anyone has the things of eternal life and of the Lord's kingdom as his end in view, then all intermediate ends, which are causes, and 
all ultimate ends, which are effects, are arranged in accordance with the end itself. And this is situated within the natural because that is where effects reside, or what amounts to the same, where 
things that are general reside. </p>
<p></p>
<p><b>[5]</b>
 Every adult person possessing any judgement at all can recognize, if he gives the matter any consideration, that he is living in two kingdoms, the spiritual kingdom 
and the natural one. He can recognize that the spiritual kingdom is interior and the natural exterior, and consequently that he is able to think one more important than the other, that is, to have 
one rather than the other in view, and therefore that with him the one which he has as his end in view or makes more important is predominant. If therefore he has the spiritual kingdom, that is, the 
things which constitute that kingdom, as his end and thinks the spiritual kingdom more important than the natural one, then he acknowledges as being first and foremost love to the Lord and charity towards 
the neighbour, and consequently all ideas that reinforce love and charity, and are called the truths of faith; for these belong to that kingdom. When this is the situation in a person, everything 
within his natural is distributed and arranged in keeping with the things of that kingdom so as to be subservient and obedient. But when he has the natural kingdom, that is, the things that exist there, 
as his end in view, and makes that more important, he annihilates all love to the Lord and charity towards the neighbour, and all faith. Indeed he goes so far as to set no value at all on these 
things, but makes love of the world and self-love, and the things which go with these, all important. When this is the case everything within his natural is arranged in keeping with those ends, and so 
is entirely at odds with the things of heaven. In this way he brings about hell within himself. Having something as the end in view consists in loving it, for every end exists as the object of a person's 
love because that which he loves he has as his end in view. </p>

`Et sustulit filios suos, et feminas suas, super camelos': </p>
<p>quod significet elevationem veritatum et affectionum illarum et ordinationem in communibus, constat a significatione `filiorum' quod sint 
vera, de qua n. 489, 491, 533, 1147, 2623; a significatione `feminarum' hic Rachelis et Leae, tum `ancillarum {1}' quod sint affectiones veri, cognitionum, et scientiarum, de qua prius; et ex significatione 
`camelorum' quod sint scientifica communia in naturali, de qua n. 3048, 3071, 3143, 3145.  Qui non novit quomodo se habet cum repraesentationibus et correspondentiis, non credere potest 
quod illa verba, nempe `sustulit filios suos et feminas suas super camelos' significent talia, apparent `ei enim' remotiora quam ut id spirituale involvant et in se contineant, nam cogitat de filiis, 
de feminis et de camelis; at angeli, qui omnia talia spiritualiter vident et percipiunt, non cogitant de filiis sed cum filii nominantur, de veris, et non de feminis sed cum feminae nominantur, 
de affectionibus veri, cognitionum et scientiarum, et non de camelis sed tunc de communibus in naturali; </p>
<p>correspondent enim ita; talis est angelica cogitatio; et quod mirum, talis {2} est cogitatio 
interni spiritualis hominis cum in corpore vivit, tametsi externus id prorsus nescit; quapropter etiam homo qui regeneratus est, cum moritur, in similem cogitationem venit et cum angelis cogitare 
et loqui potest, et hoc absque instructione, quod nequaquam fieri potuisset nisi interior cogitatio ejus talis fuisset; quod talis sit, est ex correspondentia naturalium et spiritualium: inde constare 
potest quod tametsi sensus litteralis Verbi sit naturalis, usque in se et in singulis suis contineat spiritualia, hoc est, talia quae cogitationis et inde loquelae interioris (o)seu spiritualis 
sunt, `seu' qualis est angelorum. [3] Cum elevatione veritatum et affectionum illarum, et cum ordinatione illarum in communibus, ita se habet: elevantur veritates et affectiones cum praeferuntur illa quae 
sunt vitae aeternae et regni Domini, prae illis quae sunt vitae in corpore et regni mundi; cum homo pro principali et primario agnoscit illa, et pro instrumentali et secundario haec, tunc 
elevantur apud illum veritates et affectiones illarum; tantum enim in lucem caeli, in qua est intelligentia et sapientia, transfertur et tantum illa quae sunt lucis mundi, sunt ei imagines et quasi 
specula in quibus illa videt: contrarium evenit cum praefert illa quae sunt vitae corporis et regni mundi prae illis quae sunt vitae aeternae et regni Domini, ut cum credit quod haec non sint quia 
non ea videt et quia non aliquis inde venit et {3} nuntiavit; tum si credat {4}, si sint, quod non pejus illi eveniat quam aliis, et se confirmat in illis, et vivit vitam mundi, et charitatem et 
fidem prorsus contemnit; apud talem non elevantur veritates et affectiones illarum, sed vel suffocantur, vel rejiciuntur, vel pervertuntur; in luce enim naturali est, in quam non influit aliquid lucis 
caelestis; inde patet quid per elevationem veritatum et affectionum illarum intelligitur.  [4] Quod ordinationem illarum in communibus attinet, est illa consequens; nam quantum homo praefert caelestia 
{5} mundanis, tantum ad statum caeli ordinantur illa quae in naturali ejus, sic ut appareant ibi, ut dictum, sicut imagines et specula caelestium, nam sunt {6} repraesentativa correspondentia: 
sunt fines qui ordinant, hoc est, Dominus per fines apud hominem; sunt enim tria quae ordine sequuntur, nempe fines, causae, et effectus; fines producunt causas, et per causas effectus; quales 
itaque fines sunt, tales existunt causae, et tales inde effectus; fines sunt intima apud hominem, causae sunt media, (o)et vocantur fines medii, et effectus sunt ultima, (o)et vocantur fines ultimi, 
et effectus {7} sunt etiam illa quae dicuntur communia; inde patet quid ordinatio in communibus, quod nempe cum illa quae sunt vitae aeternae (c)et regni Domini pro Me habentur, {8} omnes fines medii 
seu causae, et omnes fines ultimi seu effectus, ordinentur secundum ipsum finem, et hoc in naturali quia ibi sunt effectus, seu quod idem, ibi sunt communia.  [5] Unusquisque homo qui in adulta 
aetate aliquo judicio pollet, scire potest si modo expendat, quod in binis regnis sit, nempe in regno spirituali et in regno naturali, tum quod regnum spirituale sit interius, et regnum naturale 
exterius, et consequenter quod praeferre possit unum alteri seu pro fine habere unum prae altero, et inde quod apud illum dominetur id quod pro fine habet aut praefert; si itaque pro fine habet et 
praefert regnum spirituale, hoc est, illa quae sunt illius regni, tunc pro principali et primario agnoscit amorem in Dominum et charitatem erga proximum, proinde omnia quae confirmant illa quae vocantur fidei, 
nam haec sunt regni illius, (o)et tunc disponuntur et ordinantur omnia in naturali ejus secundum illa, ut sint servientia {9} et oboedientia: at cum pro fine habet et praefert regnum naturale, 
hoc est, illa quae ibi sunt, tunc exstinguit illa quae amoris in Dominum et charitatis erga proximum et quae fidei sunt, usque adeo ut prorsus nihili faciat illa, at amorem mundi et sui et quae 
amorum illorum {10} sunt, facit omne; haec cum fiunt, ordinantur omnia in naturali ejus secundum fines illos, ita prorsus contra illa quae sunt caeli; inde in se facit infernum. Pro fine habere
