<h3 align="center" class="ired">属天的奥秘 第6461节</h3>
<h4 align="center"></h4><p><strong>6461.</strong>“那块田和田间的洞，原是向赫人买的”表对那些领受真理，并通过真理领受良善之人的赎回。这从“买”、“田”和“洞”的含义，以及“赫人”的代表清楚可知：“买”是指赎回（参看<a href="6458.htm">6458</a>节）；“田”是指教会（<a href="2971.htm">2971</a>，<a href="3766.htm">3766</a>节），因而是指教会成员，因为他就是一个教会；“洞”是指模糊之物或模糊（<a href="2935.htm">2935</a>，<a href="6453.htm">6453</a>节）；“赫人”是指来自古教会的属灵教会（<a href="2913.htm">2913</a>，<a href="2986.htm">2986</a>节）。“赫人”因表示来自古教会的属灵教会，故表示那些领受真理，并通过真理领受良善的人；因为一个属灵教会以这种方式产生。由此明显可知，“那块田和田间的洞，原是向赫人买的”表示对那些在教会中，但仍处于模糊之中，并领受真理，通过真理领受良善之人的赎回。</p>

<p align="center"><b>Potts(1905-1910) 6461</b></p><p><b>6461.</b>
The purchase of the field and of the cave that is therein was from the sons of Heth. That this signifies the redemption of those who receive truth, and through truth good, is evident from the signification 
of a "purchase," as being redemption (see n. 6458); from the signification of a "field," as being the church (n. 2971, 3766), thus the man of the church, for he is a church; from the signification 
of a "cave," as being what is obscure (n. 2935, 6453); and from the representation of the sons of Heth, as being the spiritual church which was from the Ancient Church (n. 2913, 2986); and because 
the "sons of Heth" denote the spiritual church from the Ancient Church, they denote those who receive truth and through truth good, for from this is the spiritual church. From all this it is evident 
that by the "purchase of the field and of the cave which is in it was from the sons of Heth," is signified the redemption of those who, being in the church and as yet in obscurity, receive truth and through 
truth good. </p>

<p align="center"><b>Elliott(1983-1999) 6461</b></p><p><b>6461.</b>
'The buying of the field and of the cave that was in it was from the sons of Heth' means the redemption of those who receive truth, and through truth receive good. This is clear from the meaning of 'buying' 
as redemption, dealt with above in <a href="6458.htm">6458</a>; from the meaning of 'the field' as the Church, dealt with in <a href="2971.htm">2971</a>, <a href="3766.htm">3766</a>, thus the member of the Church since he is the Church; from the meaning of 'the 
cave' as obscurity, dealt with in <a href="2935.htm">2935</a>, <a href="6453.htm">6453</a>; and from the representation of 'the sons of Heth' as a spiritual Church from the Ancient Church, dealt with in <a href="2913.htm">2913</a>, <a href="2986.htm">2986</a>. And because 'the sons of Heth' 
are a spiritual Church from the Ancient Church, they are those who receive truth, and through truth receive good; for a spiritual Church arises in this way. From all this it is evident that 'the buying 
of the field and of the cave that was in it was from the sons of Heth' means the redemption of those who are in the Church but are still in obscurity, and who receive truth and through truth receive good. </p>

`Emptio agri et speluncae quae in illo, ex filiis Hethi':  quod significet redemptionem illorum qui recipiunt verum, et per verum bonum, constat ex significatione `emptionis' quod sit redemptio, de 
qua supra n. 6458; ex significatione `agri' quod sit Ecclesia, de qua n. 2971, 3766, ita homo Ecclesiae, nam is est Ecclesia; ex significatione `speluncae' quod sit obscurum, de qua n. 2935, 6453; et 
ex repraesentatione `filiorum Hethi' quod sint Ecclesia spiritualis quae ab Antiqua, de qua n. 2913, 2986, (m)et quia filii Hethi sunt Ecclesia spiritualis ab Antiqua, sunt illi qui recipiunt verum et 
per verum bonum, nam inde Ecclesia spiritualis.(n)  Ex his patet quod per `emptionem agri et speluncae quae in illo ex filiis Hethi' significetur redemptio illorum qui in Ecclesia et adhuc in obscuro 
recipiunt verum  et per verum bonum. </p>
