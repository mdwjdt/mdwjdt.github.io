<h3 align="center" class="ired">属天的奥秘 第5714节</h3>
<h4 align="center"></h4><p><strong>5714.</strong>有一个灵人活在肉身期间是一个彻头彻尾的奸夫。他最大的乐趣就在于和很多女人通奸，并且奸淫之后立刻抛弃并憎恶她们；甚至到了老年他还继续这种勾当。此外，他沉溺在感官欲乐中，不愿善待任何人，或提供任何服务，除非为了他自己，尤其为了达到通奸的目的。这个灵人好几天都与我在一起，我看见他在我脚下。当他生命的气场传到我这里时，凡他所到的部位，他都在我的骨膜和神经处造成疼痛，例如在我的左脚趾。当他被允许离开他所在的那些部位时，便造成疼痛的感觉，尤其在臀部骨膜、横隔膜下面的胸部骨膜，以及牙齿内部造成疼痛。当他的气场运作时，它还造成剧烈的胃痛。</p>

One who in the life of the body had been a consummate adulterer, and had made his highest delight consist in committing adultery with many women, whom he immediately afterward discarded and held in aversion, 
persisted in such practices even to old age. Moreover he had also been devoted to pleasures, and did not desire to act well to anyone and do him a service, except for his own sake, especially 
for the sake of his adultery. He was with me for several days, being seen under the feet; and when the sphere of his life was communicated to me, to whatever part he came he inflicted a pain in the periosteums 
and nerves of that part, as for instance in the toes of the left foot; and when he was permitted to rise up he inflicted pain in the parts where he was, especially in the periosteums in the 
loins, and in the periosteums of the breast under the diaphragm, and also in the interior of the teeth. While his sphere was operating it caused also great oppression in the stomach. </p>

There was a spirit who during his lifetime had been very much an adulterer. His greatest delight had lain in committing adultery with many women, whom he instantly cast aside and detested after committing 
it; and he had continued in such ways even in old age. In addition he had been given to sensual pleasures and was unwilling to treat anyone well or render any service other than for his own sake, 
especially for his adultery. This spirit was with me for several days; I saw him beneath my feet. And since the sphere emanating from his life was communicated to me, he caused wherever he went a painful 
feeling in my periostea and nerves, that is, in those in the toes of my left foot. Then, when he was allowed to leave those parts where he was, he caused painful feelings in particular in the periostea 
of my hips, also in the periostea in my chest below my diaphragm, as well as in my teeth, right inside them. While his sphere was at work it also caused severe stomachache </p>

Quidam qui in vita corporis summus adulter fuerat, et summum jucundum posuerat in {1}adulterando cum pluribus feminis, quas ilico post rejecit et aversatus est is in talibus usque ad senium perseveravit; 
insuper etiam voluptatibus deditus fuit, et non alicui bene facere voluit et officium praestare nisi ex causa sui, imprimis sui adulterii; is fuit aliquibus diebus apud me, visus sub pedibus; et 
cum sphaera vitae ejus mecum communicabatur, ubicumque {2}venit, aliquem dolorem inflixit periosteis et nervis ibi, ut digitis plantae pedis sinistri, et cum emergere ei permissum fuit, partibus ubi 
erat, imprimis periosteis in lumbis, etiam periosteis pectoris sub diaphragmate, et quoque dentibus a parte interiore.  Cum sphaera ejus operabatur, induxit etiam ventriculo gravedinem magnam. @1 defraudandis$ @2
