<h3 align="center" class="ired">属天的奥秘 第9514节</h3>
<h4 align="center"></h4><p><strong>9514.</strong>“基路伯要向上张开翅膀”表由信之真理所实现的一种提升。这从“翅膀”和“向上张开翅膀”的含义清楚可知：“翅膀”是指信之真理，如下文所述；“向上张开翅膀”是指被提升，因为在向上张开翅膀中就存在着提升自己的努力，这种努力的实现就是实际的提升。由此明显可知“基路伯要向上张开翅膀”表示良善通过信之真理向着主的提升；因为“基路伯”表示通过良善接近主。必须简要说明良善通过信之真理的提升是怎么回事。天上的一切事物和世上的一切事物都与两样事物有关，即良善和真理。没有真理的良善不是良善，没有良善的真理不是真理；因为没有真理，良善没有任何具体品质；而没有良善，真理则没有存在。事实上，真理就是良善所取的实际外在形式，要赋予良善以具体品质，就必须有形式；而良善是本质存在，良善的显现就是真理。<br />良善和真理的关系完全就像意愿和理解力的关系，因为意愿致力于接受良善，而理解力则致力于接受真理。意愿从理解力那里接受自己的具体品质，理解力则从意愿那里接受其本质存在。因为意愿在理解力里面形成，由此给自己披上一个具体品质。良善和真理的关系还像身体和手臂、双脚的关系，或就飞鸟而言，身体和翅膀的关系。没有手臂和双脚，或没有翅膀的一个身体无法移动，而是靠它们的帮助才能移动。此外，在圣言中，身体对应于良善，而手臂和翅膀对应于真理，还对应于良善通过真理所拥有并行使的能力。从这些比较，也就是对应，可以看出良善通过信之真理的提升是怎么回事，信之真理一般被称为属灵真理。至于“翅膀”表示信之真理，可参看前面的说明（<a href="8764.htm">8764</a>节）。</p>

<p align="center"><b>Potts(1905-1910) 9514</b></p><p><b>9514.</b>
And the cherubs shall spread out their wings upward. That this signifies the elevation effected by the truth of faith, is evident from the signification of "wings," as being the truths of faith (of which 
in what follows); and from the signification of "spreading out the wings upward," as being to be elevated; for in the spreading out of the wings upward there is the endeavor to elevate one's self, 
the act of which is elevation. From this it is plain that by "the wings of the cherubs being spread out upward" is signified the elevation of good to the Lord by means of the truths of faith; for by 
"the cherubs" is signified approach to Him through good. It shall here be briefly stated how the case is with the elevation of good by means of the truths of faith. There are two things to which all 
things in heaven, and also all things in the world, bear relation, namely, good and truth. Good without truth is not good, and truth without good is not truth; for good without truth has no quality, and 
truth without good has no being; for truth is the very form of good, and there must be form in order that there may be quality; and good is that very being the manifestation [existere] of which is 
truth. [2] Good is to truth exactly as the will is to the understanding, for the will has been allotted to the reception of good, and the understanding to the reception of truth. The will receives its 
quality from the understanding, and the understanding its being from the will; for the will is formed in the understanding, and thus puts on quality. Good also is to truth as the body is to the arms 
and feet, and in the case of flying creatures, as the body is to the wings. A body without arms and feet, or without wings, cannot move itself, but with their aid it moves itself. Moreover, in the Word 
the body corresponds to good, and the arms and wings to truths, and also to the powers of good through truths. From these comparisons, which are also correspondences, it may be known how the case is 
with the elevation of good by means of the truths of faith, which in general are called "spiritual" things. (That "wings" denote the truths of faith has been shown in n. 8764.) </p>

<p align="center"><b>Elliott(1983-1999) 9514</b></p><p><b>9514.</b>
'And the cherubs shall be spreading out their wings upwards' means a raising accomplished by the truth of faith. This is clear from the meaning of 'wings' as the truths of faith, dealt with below; and 
from the meaning of 'spreading out the wings upwards' as being raised, for in the spreading out of the wings upwards the endeavour to raise oneself is present, the fulfillment of the endeavour being 
the actual raising up. From all this it is evident that 'the wings of the cherubs, outspread upwards' means a raising of good in the Lord's direction by means of the truths of faith; for access to Him 
through good is meant by 'the cherubs'. Something brief must be stated here to show what a raising of good by means of the truths of faith implies. There are two realities with which everything in heaven 
and also everything in the world have connection - good and truth. Good without truth is not good, and truth without good is not truth; for without truth good lacks any specific quality, and without 
good truth is devoid of anything to give it being. Indeed truth is the actual outward form taken by good, and the form must exist to give it specific quality; but the good is the essential being, 
the manifestation of which is the truth.  </p>
<p></p>
<p><b>[2]</b>
 The relationship of good to truth is altogether like that of the will to the understanding, in that the will is dedicated to the reception of good and 
the understanding to the reception of truth. The will receives specific quality from the understanding, and the understanding its essential being from the will. For the will is formed within the understanding 
and thereby clothes itself with a specific quality. The relationship of good to truth is also like that of the body to the arms and feet, or to the wings in the case of birds. A body without 
arms and feet or without wings cannot move itself; but with the use of them it does move. Furthermore in the Word the body corresponds to good, and its arms or wings to truths and also to the powers 
good possesses in and exercises through truths. From these comparisons which are also correspondences one may see what is implied by a raising of good by means of the truths of faith, which in general 
are called spiritual truths. As regards the meaning of 'wings' as the truths of faith, see what has been shown in <a href="8764.htm">8764</a>.  </p>

</p><b>9514.</b>
`Et erunt cherubi expandentes alas suas sursum': quod significet elevationem veri fidei, constat ex significatione `alarum' quod sint vera fidei, de qua sequitur, et ex significatione `expandere {1}alas 
sursum' quod sit elevari, nam expansioni alarum sursum inest conatus se elevandi, cujus actus est elevatio, {2}ex quibus patet quod per `alas cheruborum expansas sursum' {3}significetur elevatio 
boni ad Dominum per vera fidei, nam per `cherubos' significatur aditus ad Ipsum per bonum. Hic paucis dicetur quomodo se habet cum elevatione boni per vera fidei: sunt duo ad quae omnia in caelo, et quoque 
omnia in mundo, se referunt, nempe bonum et verum; bonum absque vero non est bonum, nec verum absque bono est verum, nam bonum absque vero non habet aliquod quale, et verum absque bono non habet 
aliquod esse; verum enim est ipsa forma boni, et forma erit ut sit 2 quale; et bonum est ipsum esse {4}cujus existere est verum; bonum ad verum se prorsus habet sicut voluntas ad intellectum, voluntas 
etiam dicata est receptioni boni et intellectus receptioni veri; voluntas quale suum accipit ab intellectu, et intellectus suum esse a voluntate; formatur enim voluntas in intellectu, et sic induit 
se quali; se quoque habet bonum ad verum sicut corpus ad bracchia et pedes, et in volucribus ac alas; corpus absque bracchiis et pedibus aut absque alis non se movere potest, sed per illa se movet; etiam 
corpus in Verbo correspondet bono et bracchia atque alae veris, {5}tum boni per vera potentiis. Ex his comparativis, quae etiam sunt correspondentiae, sciri potest quomodo se habet cum elevatione 
boni per vera fidei, {6}quae in genere vocantur spiritualia. Quod alae sint vera fidei, (t)videatur ostensum n. 8764. @1 illas$ @2 ex his constare potest$ @3 significatum est altered to significata 
sit$ @4 et verum est ejus existere$ @5 et$ @6 After vera fidei, in the next sentence$ </p>
