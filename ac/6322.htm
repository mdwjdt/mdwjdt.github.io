<h3 align="center" class="ired">属天的奥秘 第6322节</h3>
<h4 align="center"></h4><p><strong>6322.</strong>根据所有表象，外在感官，如视觉和听觉，流入思维，在那里激发观念。因为表面上看，物体，以及言语激活感官，先是激活外在感官，然后激活内在感官。但是，这种表象无论多么强烈，令人信服，仍是一个错误认识。事实上，外在之物是粗鄙的、物质的，故无法流入并激活内在之物，因为内在之物是纯净的、属灵的；这与事物的性质相反。正是内在感官，也就是灵的感官，通过外在感官感知事物，并使外在感官按照它的指示获得对物体的印象。因此，外在感觉器官，如视觉器官，也就是眼睛，能立刻适应所有感官物体。若没有它们从内部所接受的流注，这一切不可能发生在感觉器官中；因为所有纤维和小附件（它们在每个感觉器官周围为数众多）立刻适应物体的性质。事实上，器官本身也立即被赋予适应的状态。<br />我经常听见灵人们彼此讨论这种表象，并且每次天使都是这样答复的：流注决非从外在进入内在，而是始终从内在进入外在；这符合次序，违反次序不可能有流注。我曾两三次看见一些灵人被分离出去，与天使社群失去联系，就因为他们出于外在表象认为从外在进入内在的流注是存在的；因此，这流注是物质的，而非属灵的。他们之所以被分离出去，是因为根据这种观点，他们有可能得出一个结论：处于外在的地狱能流入处于内在的天堂；他们还有可能得出一个结论：生命的流注并非来自主；而事实上，生命的一切皆从主流入，因为主处于至内层；相对于主，其它一切都是外在的。</p>

It is according to all appearance that the external senses, as the sight and hearing, flow into the thought, and excite ideas there; for it appears that objects, and also speech, move the senses, first 
the external, and then the internal senses. But this appearance, however strong, is nevertheless a fallacy; for what is external, being gross and material, cannot flow into and move what is internal, 
which is pure and spiritual: this is contrary to nature. It is the internal sense, that is, the sense of the spirit itself, which sensates through the external sense, and disposes the external sensory 
to receive objects according to its dictates; and therefore the sensories (as for instance the sensory of sight, or the eye) instantly accommodate themselves to all objects in accordance with the 
nature of these; which would not take place in the sensories unless there were an influx from within. For all the fibers and appendages, which are very numerous about every sensory or organ of sense, 
are in an instant determined suitably to the quality of the object; nay, into the organ itself there is instantly imparted a conformable state. I have often heard among spirits a discourse about this 
appearance, and it was as often replied by angels that influx by no means takes place from externals into internals, but always from internals into externals; and that this is according to order, contrary 
to which there can be no influx. Two or three times I have seen spirits separated from an angelic society because they had believed from the appearance that there exists an influx from externals 
into internals; thus that influx is physical and not spiritual. The reason of their separation was that according to this notion it might have been concluded that the hells, which are in externals, can 
flow into the heavens, which are in internals; and it might also have been concluded that the influx of life is not from the Lord, when yet everything of life flows in from Him, because He is in the 
inmost, and relatively to Him all things are external. </p>

<p align="center"><b>Elliott(1983-1999) 6322</b></p><p><b>6322.</b>
To all outward appearance the external senses, such as sight and hearing, flow into thought and initiate mental images there. For the appearance is that external objects activate the senses, first the 
external senses, then the internal ones, and speech too. But no matter how convincing that appearance may be, it is nevertheless a misconception. For what is external, being gross and material, cannot 
flow in and activate what is internal, which is pure and spiritual; that would be contrary to the nature of things. It is the power of the inward senses, a power belonging to the spirit itself, that 
perceives things, and it does so by means of the power of the outward senses. It is also the power of the inward senses that disposes an outward sensory organ to receive impressions of objects at its 
bidding. So it is that outward sensory organs - such as that of sight, which is the eye - instantly adapt themselves to all the objects of the senses. Nothing of this could happen in sensory organs 
without the inflow they receive from within; for all the fibres and small appendages, which are very many around each sensory organ, are instantly attuned to the nature of the object. Indeed the organ 
itself is also immediately conditioned to conform. </p>

<p><b>[2]</b>
 Discussion regarding this appearance has often taken place among spirits, and on every occasion angels have responded by saying that influx does 
not take place from external things into internal ones at all, only from internal ones into external. This, they have said, is in accordance with order, contrary to which no influx can take place. 
Two or three times I have seen spirits who have been separated from association with angels because they have been led by outward appearances to believe that such influx from external things into internal 
ones does exist, thus that influx is physical, not spiritual. The reason why they had been separated was that they might have come to the conclusion that the hells which concern themselves with 
external things could flow into the heavens which concern themselves with internal ones. They might also have concluded that life did not flow in from the Lord, when in fact He is the source of all inflowing 
life, because He exists at the inmost point and in relation to Him everything else is external. </p>

Secundum omnem apparentiam est quod sensus externi, sicut visus et auditus, influant in cogitationem et excitent ibi ideas; nam apparet quod objecta moveant sensus, primum externos et dein internos, 
et quoque loquela; sed haec apparentia utcumque fortis est, usque tamen est fallacia; externum enim quod crassum et materiale est, non potest influere et movere internum quod est purum et spirituale; 
hoc contra naturam est.  Est sensus internus, seu sensus ipsius spiritus, qui per sensum externum sentit, et disponit sensorium externum ad recipiendum objecta secundum suos (x)nutus; quapropter etiam 
sensoria, sicut sensorium visus seu oculus, se accommodant momento ad omnia objecta secundum quale illorum; quod {1}in sensoriis non existeret, nisi influxus esset' ab interiore; omnes enim fibrae et 
appendiculae, quae perplures sunt circa unumquodvis sensorium seu organum sensus, in instanti ad quale objecti convenienter determinantur; immo etiam ipsi organo infunditur momento status conformis. 
 [2]Fuit saepe inter spiritus sermo de apparentia hac, et ab angelis toties responsum quod influxus nullatenus fiat ab externis in interna sed ab internis in externa; et quod hoc sit secundum ordinem 
contra quem influxus non fieri potest.  Vidi bis et ter spiritus e societate angelica separatos quia ex apparentia crediderunt quod influxus detur ab externis in interna, ita quod influxus physicus et 
non spiritualis; causa separationis {2}fuit quod sic concludi potuisset quod inferna quae in externis, influere possent in {3}caelos qui sunt in internis; et quoque concludi potuisset quod influxus 
vitae non esset a Domino, cum tamen ab Ipso omne vitae influit, quia Ipse est in intimo et respective ad Ipsum omnia sunt externa. @1 sensoria non faciunt ex se, sed ex influxu$ @2 erat$ @3 caelum quod$ </p>
