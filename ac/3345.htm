<h3 align="center" class="ired">属天的奥秘 第3345节</h3>
<h4 align="center"></h4><p><strong>3345.</strong>由此可见，存在一系列的交流形式。然而，这些交流形式具有这样的性质：一种形式源于它们系列范围内的另一种形式，并且这一种形式就存在于邻近它的另一种里面。世人交流的性质是众所周知的，和他的思维是一样的，因为交流的形式就源于思维，他的分析活动是诸如绝无可能被仔细探究的那一类。善灵，也就是第一层天的天使的交流和流出它的思维更内在，包含更为奇妙、无法探究的事物在里面。第二层天的天使的交流和流出它的思维还要内在，包含还要完美、无法形容的事物里面。而第三层天的天使的交流和流出它的思维是至内在的，包含完全无法形容的事物在里面。尽管所有这些交流形式具有这样的性质，即它们显得彼此不同，各式各样，然而它们仍构成一个整体。因为一种形成下一种，这一种就存在于下一种里面。此外，出现在外层中的事物是内层的代表。若思维不超越世俗和肉体之物，谁也不会相信这些事，因此会以为他所具有的内层之物是虚无，殊不知，它们才构成一切事物；而相比之下，外层之物，也就是他使之构成一切事物的世俗和肉体之物，几乎是虚空。</p>

From what has been said it is evident that there are kinds of speech successively more interior, but yet of such a nature that the one comes forth from the other in order, and also that the one is within 
the other in order. The nature of man's speech is known, and also his thought from which the speech flows, the analytics of which are of such a nature that they can never be explored. The speech 
of good spirits, that is, of the angels of the first heaven, together with the thought from which it flows, is more interior, and contains within it things still more wonderful and unexplorable. The speech 
of the angels of the second heaven together with the thought from which again this flows, is still more interior, containing within it things still more perfect and unutterable. But the speech of 
the angels of the third heaven together with the thought from which again this flows, is inmost, containing within it things absolutely unutterable. And although all these kinds of speech are of such 
a nature that they appear different from one another, nevertheless there is but one speech, because the one forms the other, and the one is within the other; moreover that which comes forth in the exterior 
is representative of the interior.  A man who does not think beyond worldly and bodily things cannot believe this, and therefore supposes that the interior things with him are nothing, although 
in fact they are everything; and the exterior things, that is, the worldly and corporeal things that he makes everything, are relatively scarcely anything. </p>

From this one can see that a range of interior forms of communication exists, yet these are such that one form springs from another in that range of them and one exists within another next to it. The 
nature of the communication used by man is well known, as also is his thought in which that form of communication originates and whose analytical workings are such as cannot possibly be examined closely. 
The communication, and the thought in which it originates, of the good spirits, or the angels of the first heaven, are more interior, containing things yet more wonderful and unexaminable. The communication, 
and again the thought in which it originates, of the angels of the second heaven are still more interior, containing yet more perfect and indescribable things, while the communication, and 
yet again the thought in which it originates, of the angels of the third heaven are inmost, containing things totally indescribable. And although all these forms of communication are such that they 
appear to be different and diverse, they nevertheless make a single whole since one gives form to the next and one is present within the next. But that which occurs in a more external form is representative 
of that which is interior to it. Anyone who does not think beyond worldly and bodily things cannot believe these things, and therefore he imagines that the interior things with him are nothing, 
when in fact the interior things with him constitute everything, while those that are exterior, that is, worldly and bodily, in which he makes everything to consist, are by contrast scarcely anything.  </p>

Exinde constare potest quod loquelae ordine interiores sint, sed usque tales {1}quod una existat ab alia ordine, et quod una insit alteri ordine; hominis loquela nota est qualis est, tum quoque cogitatio 
ex qua illa loquela, cujus analytica sunt talia ut nusquam explorari possint: spirituum bonorum seu angelorum primi caeli loquela et cogitatio ex qua illa, est interior, in qua adhuc mirabiliora 
et inexplorabiliora: angelorum secundi caeli loquela et cogitatio ex qua iterum illa, est adhuc interior, in qua adhuc perfectiora et ineffabiliora: angelorum autem tertii caeli loquela et cogitatio 
ex qua iterum {2}illa, est intima, in qua prorsus ineffabilia: et tametsi omnes loquelae tales sunt ut appareant sicut aliae (c)et diversae, usque tamen una est quia una format alteram, et una inest alteri; 
{3}sed quod existit in exteriore est repraesentativum interioris. Haec homo non credere potest qui non ultra mundana et corporea cogitat, ac ideo putat quod interiora apud illum nulla sint, cum 
tamen interiora apud illum {4}sunt omne, et exteriora, hoc est, mundana et corporea, in quibus ponit omne, {4}sunt respective vix aliquid. @1 ut$  @2 haec$  @3 i exterior est correspondens interiori$
