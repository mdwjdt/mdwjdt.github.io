<h3 align="center" class="ired">属天的奥秘 第7341节</h3>
<h4 align="center"></h4><p><strong>7341.</strong>“法老回头看，到家里去”表基于虚假的思考和反思。这从“回头看”和“法老的家”的含义清楚可知：“回头看”是指思考和反思，因为就灵义而言，“回头看”不是指用眼睛看某种东西，而是用头脑看某种东西，因而是指思考和反思；“法老的家”是指虚假。因为当法老代表虚假时，他的爱也代表虚假；因此，“到他家里去”表示（转向）虚假。由于这些话表示思考和反思，所以接下来经上说他“也不把这事放在心上”。因为凡基于虚假思考的人都不把给予警告的神性放在心上。</p>

<p align="center"><b>Potts(1905-1910) 7341</b></p><p><b>7341.</b>
And Pharaoh looked back, and came unto his house. That this signifies thought and reflection from falsities, is evident from the signification of "looking back," as being thought and reflection, for 
in the spiritual sense "to look back" is not to look with the eyes toward anything, but to look with the mind, thus to think and reflect; and from the signification of "Pharaoh's house," as being falsity. 
For when Pharaoh represents falsity, his house also represents the same; hence "to come unto his house" signifies falsities. And as by these words are signified thought and reflection from falsities, 
therefore it follows that he "did not set his heart to this;" for he who thinks from falsities does not set his heart to the Divine which gives warning. </p>

<p align="center"><b>Elliott(1983-1999) 7341</b></p><p><b>7341.</b>
'And Pharaoh looked back and went to his house' means thought and reflection based on falsities. This is clear from the meaning of 'looking back' as thought and reflection, for in the spiritual sense 
'looking back' is not looking at something with one's eyes but looking mentally, thus thinking and reflecting; and from the meaning of 'Pharaoh's house' as falsity. For when 'Pharaoh' represents falsity 
his 'house' has the same meaning; and therefore 'going to his house' means [turning to] falsities. And since these words mean thought and reflection based on falsities, the phrase about his not taking 
this to heart follows. For a person whose thought is based on falsities does not take it to heart when the Divine warns him. </p>

</p><b>7341.</b>
`Et respexit Pharao, et venit ad domum suam': quod significet cogitationem et reflexionem ex falsis, constat ex significatione `respicere' quod sit cogitatio et reflexio, nam `respicere' in sensu spirituali 
non est spectare oculis versus {1}aliquid, sed est spectare mente, ita cogitare et reflectere; et ex significatione `domus Pharaonis' quod sit falsum; cum enim `Pharao' repraesentat falsum, etiam 
idem domus ejus; inde `venire ad domum suam' significat {2} falsa; {3}et qui; per illa verba significatur cogitatio et reflexio ex falsis, ideo sequitur	 quod `non {4}posuerit cor {5} ad hoc, nam 
qui ex falsis cogitat non ponit cor ad Divinum quod admonet. 	@1 aliquod$ 	@2 i ad$ 	@3 et quare etiam$ 	@4 posuit$ 	@5 i suum$ </p>
