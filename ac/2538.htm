<h3 align="center" class="ired">属天的奥秘 第2538节</h3>
<h4 align="center"></h4><p><strong>2538.</strong>“你当知道，你必要死”表真理与良善的教义不会存在。这也从前面所述（<a href="2516.htm">2516</a>节）清楚可知，那里有类似的话。同样，“和你所有的人”表连同属于它，即教义的一切。“所有人”的内义表教义的一切事物的原因在于，圣言中所提及的人物均表示真实事物，因此“亚比米勒所有的人”表教义的一切事物。由此明显可知本节这些话的内义是什么，也就是说，他要交出未经理性玷污的教义的属灵真理，它以这种方式被指教并启示给祂，教义因此具有生命。但是，若他不交出未经理性玷污的属灵真理，那么真理与良善的教义会在方方面面变得无效。<br />教义的情形乃是这样：信仰越扎根于属于人之物，即扎根于感官印象、记忆知识和理性，教义就越无效。而感官印象、记忆知识和理性越被剔除，也就是说，教义越不因这些事物而被相信，教义就越存活，因为神性越能流入进来。人所具有的这些属性会妨碍流注和接受。不过，出于理性事物、记忆知识和感官印象去相信，也就是说，请教它们才去相信是一回事；通过理性事物、记忆知识和感官印象确认和强化所信的明显是另一回事。这二者之间的区别从下文明显看出来，因为本章在内义上会论述这些事。</p>

Know thou that dying thou shalt die. That this signifies that there will be no doctrine of truth and good, is also evident from what was said above (n. 2516); where also the words are similar. In like 
manner that "all that are thine" signifies all the things that are of it, namely, of the doctrine, together. That in the internal sense "all" signifies everything or all things, is because in the Word 
persons signify actual things; and thus "all that belonged to Abimelech" signifies everything or all things that are of doctrine. From all this then it is evident what is the internal sense of the 
words in this verse; namely, that He should render up the spiritual truth of doctrine without taint from the rational, and that thereby it would be taught and revealed to Him, and thus doctrine would 
have life; but that if He should not render up spiritual truth without taint from the rational, the doctrine of truth and good would become null and void in respect to each and all things of it. [2] 
In regard to doctrine the case is this: Insofar as there is what is human (that is, what is of sense, of memory-knowledge, and of the rational) as the ground of belief, so far the doctrine is null and 
void. But insofar as what is of sense, of memory-knowledge, and of the rational is removed, that is, insofar as doctrine is believed without these things, so far doctrine lives; for so far the Divine 
flows in. It is that which is proper to the human that hinders the influx and the reception. But it is one thing to believe from what is of the rational, of memory-knowledge, and of sense (that is, to 
consult such things in order to believe), and quite another thing to confirm and corroborate by means of things rational, of memory-knowledge, and of sense, that which is believed. What the difference 
is will be made plain in what follows; for these things also are treated of in this chapter in the internal sense. </p>

<p align="center"><b>Elliott(1983-1999) 2538</b></p><p><b>2538.</b>
'Know that you will certainly die' means that no doctrine of truth and good will exist. This too becomes clear from what has been stated above in <a href="2516.htm">2516</a>, where also similar words occur. Likewise 'everyone 
who is yours' means all that belonged to it together, namely to doctrine. The reason why in the internal sense 'everyone' means every thing or all things is that persons mentioned in the Word mean 
real things, and so 'everyone who is Abimelech's' means every thing or all things of doctrine. From all this it is now evident what the internal sense is of the words in this verse, namely that the spiritual 
truth of doctrine was by him to be brought back untouched by the rational, and that in this way it was to be taught and to be revealed to Him, and so the doctrine would have life. But if spiritual 
truth was not by him brought back untouched from the rational, the doctrine of truth and good would be worthless in every single respect of it. </p>
<p></p>
<p><b>[2]</b>
 The position with doctrine is that insofar 
as belief is rooted in what belongs to the human, that is, in sensory impressions, factual knowledge, and rational deductions, no doctrine exists; but insofar as sensory impressions, factual knowledge, 
and rational deductions are put aside, that is, insofar as belief is formed quite apart from these, doctrine comes into being because the Divine is able to flow in; whereas those properties possessed 
by the human prevent influx and reception. It is however one thing to rely for belief on rational deductions, factual knowledge, and sensory impressions, that is, to resort to them so as to arrive at 
belief, but quite another to confirm and strengthen belief by means of rational deductions, factual knowledge, and sensory impressions. The difference between the two approaches will be evident in what 
follows below, for these also are dealt with in the internal sense in this chapter. </p>

`Scito, quod moriendo moriaris': quod significet quod nulla doctrina veri et boni, etiam constare potest ab illis quae supra n. 2516 dicta sunt, ubi quoque similia verba: pariter quod `omnis qui tibi' 
significat omnia quae ejus, nempe doctrinae, una; quod `omnis' significet omne seu omnia in sensu interno, inde est quia `personae' in Verbo significant res, ita `omnis qui Abimelecho,' omne seu omnia 
quae doctrinae.  Ex his {1} nunc patet quis sensus internus est {2} verborum quae in hoc versu, nempe quod spirituale verum doctrina immune redderet a rationali, et quod ita doceretur, ac Ipsi revelabitur, 
et sic vita doctrinae; at si non spirituale verum immune redderet rationali, quod doctrina veri et boni nulla foret quoad omnia et singula ejus.  [2] Se habet ita cum doctrina: quantum humani, 
hoc est, quantum sensualis, scientifici et rationalis est, ex quibus creditur quod ita sit tantum est nulla doctrina; at quantum sensuale, scientificum et rationale removetur, hoc est, {3} absque illis 
creditur, tantum vivit doctrina, nam tantum influit Divinum; sunt humani propria quae impediunt influxum et receptionem: sed aliud est credere ex rationali, scientifico et sensuali, seu consulere 
illa ut credatur; et aliud est confirmare et corroborare illud quod creditur, per rationalia, scientifica et sensualia; quae differentia sit, patebit in sequentibus, de illis enim in sensu interno in 
hoc capite, etiam {4} agitur. 	@1 Inde.$ 	@2 est after versu.$ 	@3 seu.$ 	@4 i in specie.$ </p>
