<p><strong>[NCE]790.</strong> The symbolism of water here and below as falsity is established by the passages dealing with a flood of water that were cited from the Word in the prefatory section of this chapter and at verse <a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_790/bible_king-james-version_genesis_7_6" target=_top>6</a> [<a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_790/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_705" target=_top>705</a>, <a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_790/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_739" target=_top>739</a>]. The quotations in those two places show that floods of water symbolize times of desolation and trial, which carry the same consequences as false notions, since desolation and trial are nothing but deluges of the falsities stirred up by evil spirits. The symbolism of flood water as falsities comes from the general meaning of water in the Word as something spiritual, that is, as the things we truly understand, grasp rationally, and know about. Because water symbolizes these things, it also symbolizes their opposites, since every falsity, being a matter of thought, is a "fact," so to speak, and seems capable of being grasped rationally and understood.<br />The symbolism of water as things that are spiritual can be seen from many places in the Word.{*1} In support of its symbolism as falsity, though, I offer the following in addition to previous quotations.{*2} [2] In Isaiah:<br />This people spurned the waters of Shiloah, which go gently. Therefore (look, now!) the Lord is bringing up over them the waters of a river, strong and abundant; and it will come up over all their brooks and go on all their banks. (<a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_790/bible_king-james-version_isaiah_8_6-7" target=_top>Isaiah 8:6-7</a>)<br />The waters going gently stand for things that are spiritual, waters strong and abundant for things that are false. In the same author:<br />Doom to a land casting shadow with its wings,{*3} a land across the rivers of Cush, that sends ambassadors onto the sea and [puts them] in rattan vessels on the face of the water. Go, speedy envoys, to a nation marked out and trampled, whose land the rivers plunder. (<a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_790/bible_king-james-version_isaiah_18_1-2" target=_top>Isaiah 18:1-2</a>)<br />Here they stand for the falsities that belong to a "land casting shadow with its wings."<br />[3] In the same author:<br />When you cross through the water, I will be with you, and [when you cross] through the rivers, they will not drown you. (<a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_790/bible_king-james-version_isaiah_43_2" target=_top>Isaiah 43:2</a>)<br />The water and rivers stand for difficulties and for falsities. In Jeremiah:<br />Why should you go to Egypt to drink the waters of the Sihor? And why should you go to Assyria to drink the waters of the river? (<a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_790/bible_king-james-version_jeremiah_2_18" target=_top>Jeremiah 2:18</a>)<br />The waters stand for the falsities produced by crooked reasoning. In the same author:<br />Who is this who rises like a river, whose waters churn like rivers? Egypt rises like a river, and like rivers its waters churn, and it said, "I will go up; I will cover the land; I will destroy the city and those living in it." (<a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_790/bible_king-james-version_jeremiah_46_7-8" target=_top>Jeremiah 46:7-8</a>)<br />The waters stand for the falsities produced by crooked reasoning.<br />[4] In Ezekiel:<br />This is what the Lord Jehovih has said, "When I turn you into a devastated city, like cities that are not inhabited; when I bring up over you the abyss, and many waters cover you, and I make you go down with those going down into the pit ..." (<a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_790/bible_king-james-version_ezekiel_26_19-20" target=_top>Ezekiel 26:19-20</a>)<br />The waters stand for evil and the falsity it engenders. In Habakkuk:<br />You trod the sea with your horses, the mud of many waters. (<a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_790/bible_king-james-version_habakkuk_3_15" target=_top>Habakkuk 3:15</a>)<br />The waters stand for falsity. In John:<br />The dragon hurled water like a river from its mouth after the woman to cause her to be swallowed up by the stream. (<a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_790/bible_king-james-version_revelation_12_15-16" target=_top>Revelation 12:15-16</a>)<br />The water here stands for falsities and lies. In David:<br />Put out your hands from high up, rescue me and free me from the many waters, from the hand of a foreigner's children, whose mouth speaks a lie, and their right hand is the right hand of falsity. (<a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_790/bible_king-james-version_psalms_144_7-8" target=_top>Psalms 144:7-8</a>)<br />The many waters clearly stand for falsities. A foreigner's children also symbolize falsities.<br /><br /><strong>Footnotes:</strong><br />{*1} On the meaning of water as spiritual things, see the biblical passages quoted and explained in <a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_790/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_28" target=_top>28</a>, <a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_790/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_680#subsection-2-3" target=_top>680:3</a>.

[LHC]<br />{*3} The land seems to be pictured as a huge bird throwing a shadow with its wings or, alternatively, perhaps a cloud of locusts. Swedenborg, Schmidt 1696, and some other older Bible translators read the key Hebrew word as meaning "shadowing;" modern translators take it as referring to the sound of bird or insect wings. The Hebrew root in question is צָלַל (ṣālal), which represents several homographs, including one that means to be dark and one that means to tingle in the ears. [LHC] </p>

That the "waters" here and in the following verses signify falsities, is evident from the passages of the Word adduced at the beginning of this chapter, and at verse 6, where a "flood" or inundation 
of waters is treated of. It is there shown that inundations of waters signify desolations and temptations, which involve the same as falsities; for desolations and temptations are nothing else than inundations 
of falsities that are excited by evil spirits. That such "waters" signify falsities, is because in the Word "waters" in general signify what is spiritual, that is, what is of understanding, 
of reason, and of memory-knowledge [intellectuale, rationale, et scientificum]; and as they signify these they also signify their contraries, for every falsity is a something pertaining to memory-knowledge, 
and appears as a thing of reason and understanding, because it is of the thought.  [2] That "waters" signify spiritual things, is evident from many passages in the Word; and that they also signify 
falsities, let the following passages, in addition to those already cited, serve for confirmation. In Isaiah: </p>
<p>     This people hath refused the waters of Shiloah that go softly; therefore behold 
the Lord bringeth up upon them the waters of the river, strong and many, and he shall go over all his banks (Isa. 8:6-7). The "waters that go softly" here denote things spiritual, "waters strong and 
many" falsities. Again: </p>
<p>     Woe to the land shadowing with wings, which is beyond the rivers of Ethiopia; that sendeth ambassadors upon the sea, and in vessels of papyrus upon the waters. Go, ye swift 
messengers, to a nation meted out and trodden down, whose land the rivers have spoiled (Isa. 18:1-2),  denoting the falsities which are of the "land shadowing with wings." [3] Again: </p>
<p>     When thou 
passest through the waters I will be with thee, and through the rivers they shall not overflow thee (Isa. 43:2). The "waters" and "rivers" denote difficulties, and also falsities. In Jeremiah: </p>
<p> 
    What hast thou to do with the way of Egypt, to drink the waters of Shihor? And what hast thou to do with the way of Assyria, to drink the waters of the river? (Isa. 2:18), where "waters" denote falsities 
from reasonings. Again: </p>
<p>     Who is this that riseth up as a river? as the rivers his waters are in commotion. Egypt riseth up as a river, and as the rivers his waters toss themselves; and he 
said, I will rise up, I will cover the earth, I will destroy the city and the inhabitants thereof (Isa. 46:7-8), where again "waters" denote falsities from reasonings.  [4] In Ezekiel: </p>
<p>     Thus 
saith the Lord Jehovih, When I shall make thee a desolate city, like the cities that are not inhabited, when I shall bring up the deep upon thee, and the great waters shall cover thee, then will I bring 
thee down with them that descend into the pit (Ezek. 26:19-20). "Waters" here denote evils and the falsities therefrom. In Habakkuk:     Thou didst tread the sea with thine horses, the mire of many 
waters (Hab. 3:15), where "waters" denote falsities. In John: </p>
<p>     And the serpent cast forth after the woman, out of his mouth, water as a river, that he might cause her to be carried away by the 
stream (Rev. 12:15-16). Here "waters" denote falsities and lies. In David: </p>
<p>     Send Thine hand from above, rescue me and deliver me out of great waters, out of the hand of the sons of the stranger, 
whose mouth speaketh a lie, and their right hand is a right hand of falsehood (Ps. 144:7-8). "Great waters" here manifestly denote falsities; the "sons of the stranger" also signify falsities. </p>

'Waters' here and in what follows means falsities. This becomes clear from the places in the Word quoted in the preliminary section of this chapter
</OL>
<h4>Notes</h4><small>
<a name="fn1"></a><a href="#fntext1"><sup>a</sup></a> and from those at verse 6 of this chapter, where the 
flood or inundation of waters is the subject. In those places it was shown that 'inundations of waters' meant desolations and temptations, which entail the same thing as falsities, for desolations 
and temptations are nothing else than inundations of falsities that have been activated by evil spirits. The reason why such waters mean falsities is that generally 'waters' in the Word means that which 
is spiritual, that is, that which is intellectual, rational, and factual. And since waters mean these they also mean their opposites, for every falsity is a factual matter, and seemingly rational and 
intellectual since it is a matter belonging to thought. </p>
<p></p>
<p><b>[2]</b>
 That 'waters' means spiritual things is clear from very many places in the Word. But that 'waters' also means falsities, let the passages 
that follow, in addition to those quoted already, serve to confirm the point. In Isaiah,  </p>
<blockquote>
This people have refused the waters of Shiloah that go out gently. Therefore, behold the Lord is causing 
to rise up over them the waters of the river, mighty and many. And it will rise up over all its channels and go over all its banks. <a href="http://bible.gospelcom.net/cgi-bin/bible?passage=Isa%208:6,%207&amp;version=ESV&amp;interface=print&amp;showfn=yes&amp;showxref">Isa 8:6, 7</a>.  
</blockquote>
<p>Here 'waters that go out gently' stands for spiritual 
things, 'waters mighty and many' for falsities. In the same prophet,  </p>
<p>Woe to the land shadowing with wings, which is beyond the rivers of Gush, sending ambassadors to the sea, and in vessels of 
papyrus over the face' of the waters! Go, you swift ambassadors, to a nation marked out and trodden down, whose land the rivers have spoiled. <a href="http://bible.gospelcom.net/cgi-bin/bible?passage=Isa%2018:1,%202&amp;version=ESV&amp;interface=print&amp;showfn=yes&amp;showxref">Isa 18:1, 2</a>. </p>
<p>This stands for falsities, which belong 
to 'the land shadowing with wings'. </p>
<p></p>
<p><b>[3]</b>
 In the same prophet, </p>
<blockquote>
When you pass through the waters, I will be with you; and through the rivers, they will not overwhelm you. <a href="http://bible.gospelcom.net/cgi-bin/bible?passage=Isa%2043:2&amp;version=ESV&amp;interface=print&amp;showfn=yes&amp;showxref">Isa 43:2</a>.  
</blockquote>
<p>'Waters' and 
'rivers' stand for difficulties, and also for falsities. In Jeremiah, </p>
<blockquote>
 What have you to do with the way to Egypt, to drink the waters of Shihor? And what have you to do with the way to Asshur, to 
drink the waters of the River? <a href="http://bible.gospelcom.net/cgi-bin/bible?passage=Jer%202:18&amp;version=ESV&amp;interface=print&amp;showfn=yes&amp;showxref">Jer 2:18</a>.  
</blockquote>
<p>'Waters' stands for falsities arising out of reasonings. In the same prophet, </p>
<blockquote>
Who is this coming up like a river, like the rivers his waters are tossed 
about? Egypt comes up like the river, and like the rivers his waters are tossed about. And he said, I will go up, I will cover the earth, I will destroy the city and those who dwell in it. <a href="http://bible.gospelcom.net/cgi-bin/bible?passage=Jer%2046:7,%208&amp;version=ESV&amp;interface=print&amp;showfn=yes&amp;showxref">Jer 46:7, 8</a>. 
</blockquote>
<p>'Waters' stands for falsities arising out of reasonings. </p>
<p></p>
<p><b>[4]</b>
 In Ezekiel, </p>
<blockquote>
Thus said the Lord Jehovah, When I make you a city laid waste, like the cities that are not inhabited, when I shall 
cause the deep to come up over you, and many waters have covered you, I will cause you to go down with those who go down into the Pit. <a href="http://bible.gospelcom.net/cgi-bin/bible?passage=Ezek%2016:19,%2020&amp;version=ESV&amp;interface=print&amp;showfn=yes&amp;showxref">Ezek 16:19, 20</a>. 
</blockquote>
<p>'Waters' stands for evils and derivative 
falsities. In Habakkuk,  </p>
<blockquote>
 You did trample the sea with Your horses, the mud of many waters. <a href="http://bible.gospelcom.net/cgi-bin/bible?passage=Hab%203:15&amp;version=ESV&amp;interface=print&amp;showfn=yes&amp;showxref">Hab 3:15</a>. 
</blockquote>
<p>'Waters' stands for falsities. In John, </p>
<blockquote>
The dragon poured water like a stream out of his 
mouth after the woman, to swallow her up in the river. <a href="http://bible.gospelcom.net/cgi-bin/bible?passage=Rev%2011:15,%2016&amp;version=ESV&amp;interface=print&amp;showfn=yes&amp;showxref">Rev 11:15, 16</a>. 
</blockquote>
<p>Here 'waters' stands for falsities and lies. In David, </p>
<blockquote>
Send forth Your hands from on high, rescue me, and deliver me from 
the many waters, from the hands of sons of the foreigner, whose mouths speak lies, and whose right hands are right hands of falsity. <a href="http://bible.gospelcom.net/cgi-bin/bible?passage=Ps%20144:7,%208&amp;version=ESV&amp;interface=print&amp;showfn=yes&amp;showxref">Ps 144:7, 8</a>. 
</blockquote>
<p>Here 'many waters' clearly stands for falsities, and 
'sons of the foreigner also means falsities. </p>
