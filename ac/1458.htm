<h3 align="center" class="ired">属天的奥秘 第1458节</h3>
<h4 align="center"></h4><p><strong>1458.</strong>“往南地去”表进入良善和真理，因此就内在事物而言，表进入光的状态。这从“南地”的含义清楚可知。“南地”表光的状态起因于以下事实：来世既没有地区，也没有时间，只有地区和时间所表示的状态。理解力之物的相继状态就象一日四时和一年四季的状态，也象这四个地区的状态。一日的状态可分为暮、晚、晨、午；一年的状态可分为秋、冬、春、夏；四个地区的状态则是相对太阳的西、北、东、南而言的。理解力之物的相继状态就类似于这些。奇妙的是，在天堂，那些处于智慧聪明状态的人皆住在光明中，正合乎他们的状态；而那些处于至高智慧聪明状态的人则住在最大的光明中；不过，那里的智慧都出于爱和仁，聪明都出于对主的信。尘世之光几乎无法与来世之光相比，这是我通过大量经验确证的事实（对此，蒙主怜悯，容后再述）。因为在天堂，光与理解力事物之间存在对应关系，故在圣言的各处，“南地或南方”在内义上并非表其它事物。此处“南地”表通过认知所获得的聪明。认知就是属天、属灵的真理，这些真理就是天堂之光的众多辐射，并藉着这光使自身呈为可见，如前所述。由于主现在被赋予认知，以便祂在人性本质方面可以成为天堂之光本身，故此处经上说“后来，亚伯兰又继续踏上往南地去的旅程”。<br />“南地”表这些事物，这从圣言中的类似例子清楚可知，如以赛亚书：<br />我要对北方说，交出来！对南方说，不要拘留！将我的众子从远方带来，将我的众女从地极领回。（以赛亚书<a href="http://39-27.cn/赛43.6.htm">43:6</a>）<br />“北方”表那些无知的人，“南方”表那些具有认知的人，“众子”表真理，“女儿”表良善。<br />你若将你储存的食物拿出来供应饥饿的人，使困苦的灵魂得满足，你的光就必在黑暗中升起，你的幽暗必变如正午。（以赛亚书<a href="http://39-27.cn/赛58.10.htm">58:10</a>）<br />“将你储存的食物拿出来供应饥饿的人，使困苦的灵魂得满足”一般表仁爱的善行。“你的光就必在黑暗中升起”表真理使他们变得聪明的事实。“你的幽暗必变如正午”表良善使他们变得智慧的事实。“南方”表凭借其温暖的良善，凭借其光明的真理。<br />以西结书：<br />在神的异象中带我到以色列地，安置在至高的山上；在山上的南边有仿佛一座城的建筑物。（以西结书<a href="http://39-27.cn/结40.2.htm">40:2</a>）<br />这论及新耶路撒冷，或主的国，它因处在智慧聪明的光明中，故在“南边”。诗篇：<br />耶和华要使你的公义如光发出，使你的公平明如正午。（诗篇<a href="http://39-27.cn/诗37.6.htm">37:6</a>）<br /><br />你必不怕黑夜的惊骇，或是白日飞的箭；也不怕黑夜行的瘟疫，或是午间肆虐的灾难。（诗篇<a href="http://39-27.cn/诗91.5.htm">91:5</a>，<a href="http://39-27.cn/诗91.6.htm">6</a>）<br />“不怕午间肆虐的灾难”表不怕临到那些拥有认知却滥用它们的人身上的咒诅。以西结书：<br />人子啊，你要面向南方，向南滴下话语，预言攻击南方田野的森林。对南方的森林说，从南到北，人的脸面都被烧焦。（以西结书<a href="http://39-27.cn/结20.46.htm">20:46</a>，<a href="http://39-27.cn/结20.47.htm">47</a>）<br />“南方的森林”表那些拥有真理之光却将其熄灭的人，因而表教会里面那些具有此种性质的人。<br />但以理书：<br />四角之中，有一角长出一个小角，向南、向东、向荣美之地，渐渐成为强大。它渐渐强大，高及天象。（但以理书<a href="http://39-27.cn/但8.9.htm">8:9</a>，<a href="http://39-27.cn/但8.10.htm">10</a>）<br />这表示攻击良善和真理的人。耶利米书：<br />耶和华你们的神未使黑暗来到，你们的脚未在昏暗山上绊跌之先，当将荣耀归给他，免得你们盼望光明，祂使光明变为死荫，成为幽暗。南方的城尽都关闭，无人开放。（耶利米书<a href="http://39-27.cn/耶13.16.htm">13:16</a>，<a href="http://39-27.cn/耶13.19.htm">19</a>）<br />“南方的城”表示对真理和良善的认知。俄巴底亚书：<br />在西法拉中被掳的耶路撒冷人，必得南地的城邑。（俄巴底亚书<a href="http://39-27.cn/俄1.20.htm">1:20</a>）<br />此处，“南地的城邑”同样表真理和良善，因而表他们得为业的真理和良善本身。此处的主题是主的国度。<br />如前所述，“亚伯兰又继续踏上往南地去的旅程” 表主进入良善和真理，因此就内在事物而言，表进入光的状态。这一点要这样来理解：认知开辟了一条看见属天、属灵事物之路。藉着认知所开辟的这条路是为了内在人通向外在人。接受的容器就居于外在人中，这些容器和对良善与真理的认知一样多，属天之物正是流入这些认知中，如同流入它们的容器。</p><br />

<hr /><p> 1458. The fact that toward the south means into goodness and truth and so into a condition in which inner things would be clear can be seen from the symbolism of the south, or noonday light.{*1} The symbolism of the south as a stage of clarity comes from this: In the other life there are no compass directions, just as there are no times and seasons, but only the conditions symbolized by directions and time periods. The state of our ability to understand things resembles conditions at different times of day and seasons of the year and also in different quarters of the globe. A day goes through the stages of evening, night, morning, and midday; a year goes through those of fall, winter, spring, and summer; and conditions in the four quarters are those of the sun in the west, north, east, and south. Similar to these conditions are the states of our ability to understand. In heaven, amazing to say, the people on whom the light shines are those who enjoy a condition of wisdom and understanding, and it shines in perfect accord with that condition. Those who enjoy the highest state of wisdom and understanding have the greatest light. Wisdom there, however, is a matter of love and charity, while understanding there is a matter of faith in the Lord. The other world has a kind of light to which the light of the world can hardly be compared, as a wealth of experience has shown me. (I will have more to say about these experiences below [搂搂<a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_1458/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_1521" target=_top>1521-1534</a>, <a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_1458/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_1619" target=_top>1619-1625</a>], with the Lord's divine mercy.) And because such a correspondence exists in heaven between light and matters of understanding, here and elsewhere in the Word that is truly what the south means.{*2} The south here symbolizes understanding, which is acquired by means of religious knowledge. Religious concepts are heavenly and spiritual truths, which are just so many rays of light in heaven and which the light also makes visible, as noted. Because the Lord was now to soak up knowledge, so that he could become the actual light of heaven even in respect to his human nature, the present verse says that he traveled, going and traveling toward the south.<br />[2] The fact that the south symbolizes these things can be seen from similar passages in the Word, as in Isaiah:<br />I will say to the north, "Hand them over!" and to the south, "Do not hinder them! Bring my sons from far away and my daughters from the end of the earth." (<a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_1458/bible_king-james-version_isaiah_43_6" target=_top>Isaiah 43:6</a>)<br />The north stands for people who lack knowledge; the south, for people who possess it. Sons stand for truth and daughters for goodness. In the same author:<br />If you bring out your soul{*3} for someone starving and satiate an afflicted soul, in the shadows your light will rise, and your darkness will be like midday. (<a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_1458/bible_king-james-version_isaiah_58_10" target=_top>Isaiah 58:10</a>)<br />Bringing out your soul for someone starving and satiating an afflicted soul stands for good deeds inspired by neighborly love, in general. "In the shadows your light will rise" stands for the fact that [people who do such deeds] have an intelligent understanding of truth, while "your darkness will be like midday" stands for the fact that they have a wise appreciation of goodness; midday, or the south, symbolizes goodness on account of its warmth, and truth on account of its brightness.<br />[3] In Ezekiel:<br />In visions of God, he brought me to the land of Israel and put me on a mountain which was very tall and on which there was something like the structure of a city on the south. (<a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_1458/bible_king-james-version_ezekiel_40_2" target=_top>Ezekiel 40:2</a>)<br />This is about a new Jerusalem, or the Lord's kingdom, which is said to be on the south because it has the light of wisdom and understanding. In David:<br />Jehovah will present your virtue as a light and your integrity as the midday. (<a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_1458/bible_king-james-version_psalms_37_6" target=_top>Psalms 37:6</a>)<br />In the same author:<br />You will not be afraid of the horror at night, of the arrow [that] might fly by day; of contagion [that] will walk in the dark, of destruction [that] ravages at midday. (<a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_1458/bible_king-james-version_psalms_91_5-6" target=_top>Psalms 91:5-6</a>)<br />Not being afraid of the destruction that ravages everything at midday stands for not being afraid of the damnation that befalls people who have knowledge and pervert it. In Ezekiel:<br />Child of humankind, turn your face toward the south and loose a shower [of words] to the south and prophesy to the forest of the south field. And you are to say to the forest of the south, "All faces from south to north will be burned in [the flame]." (<a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_1458/bible_king-james-version_ezekiel_20_46-47" target=_top>Ezekiel 20:46-47</a>)<br />The forest of the south stands for people who have the light of truth but put it out; so it stands for people like this in the church.<br />[4] In Daniel:<br />From one of [the goat's horns] one small horn went out and grew quite a bit toward the south and toward the sunrise and toward the ornament [of Israel],{*4} and it grew right to the army of the heavens. (<a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_1458/bible_king-james-version_daniel_8_9-10" target=_top>Daniel 8:9-10</a>)<br />This stands for individuals who attack what is good and true. In Jeremiah:<br />Give glory to Jehovah your God before he brings darkness and before your feet stumble on the dusky mountains; and you will wait for light, and he will turn it into the shadow of death, he will turn it into blackness. The cities of the south will be closed, and there will be no one to open. (<a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_1458/bible_king-james-version_jeremiah_13_16" target=_top>Jeremiah 13:16</a>, <a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_1458/bible_king-james-version_jeremiah_13_19" target=_top>19</a>)<br />The cities of the south stand for knowledge of truth and goodness. In Obadiah:<br />The deportees of Jerusalem who are in Sepharad will inherit the cities of the south. (Obadiah verse <a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_1458/bible_king-james-version_obadiah_1_20" target=_top>20</a>)<br />The cities of the south again stand for truth and goodness and so for the truth and goodness they actually inherit. The topic here is the Lord's kingdom.<br />[5] As I said, "Abram traveled, going and traveling toward the south," symbolizes the Lord's advance into goodness and truth and so into a condition in which inner things were clear. The case with this is that knowledge is what opens up a line of sight to heavenly and spiritual entities. Knowledge opens a path leading from the inner self to the outer, which contains receiving vessels 钬?as many receiving vessels as concepts concerning goodness and truth. Heavenly things flow into these concepts as their proper vessels.<br /><br /><strong>Footnotes:</strong><br />{*1} The Latin word for the south (meridies) also means "midday" or "noon," or "noonday light." The terms are often interchangeable in Swedenborg's writing. [LHC]<br />{*2} Obviously it is people living in the northern hemisphere of the world 钬?people such as Swedenborg, his European audience, and the inhabitants of the Bible world 钬?who associate the south with a condition of abundant light. For Bible occurrences of "south" that Swedenborg explicitly connects with enlightenment, see the examples later in this section. [LHC]<br />{*3} The Hebrew word for "soul" here (谞侄驻侄砖讈 [ne峁昬拧]) often means "life" (see note 1 in 搂<a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_1458/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_1000" target=_top>1000</a>), and because it means life it can also mean the sustenance necessary to life, as it does in this instance. [LHC]<br />{*4} Some translators take the "ornament" here (爪职讘执执讬 [峁Ｇ浊竾卯]) to mean the land of Israel. Brown, Driver, and Briggs 1996, page 840 left column, Strong's 6643, suggests that it refers especially to Jerusalem and the Temple, and that is the meaning assumed in this rendering: that is, Jerusalem and the Temple are the ornament of Israel.

That "toward the south" signifies into goods and truths, and thus into a state of light as to the interiors, is evident from the signification of "the south." That "the south" signifies a state of light, 
comes from the fact that there are neither quarters nor times in the other life, but states which are signified by quarters and times. The states of intellectual things are as the states of the times 
of the day and of the year, and also as the states of the quarters. The states of the day are those of evening, night, morning, and noon; the states of the year are those of autumn, winter, spring, 
and summer; and the states of the quarters are those of the sun, in its relation to the west, the north, the east, and the south. Similar to these are the states of intellectual things. And, what is 
wonderful, in heaven those are in light who are in a state of wisdom and intelligence, exactly according to their state; those being in the greatest light who are in a state of the highest wisdom and 
intelligence; but the wisdom there is that of love and charity, and the intelligence is that of faith in the Lord. That in the other life there is light to which the light of the world can scarcely 
be compared, is to me a fact established by much experience (concerning which, of the Lord's Divine mercy hereafter), and because there is in heaven such a correspondence between light and intellectual 
things, therefore in the Word, in this and in other passages, nothing else is signified in the internal sense by "the south." "The south" here signifies the intelligence which is procured by means of 
knowledges. These knowledges are celestial and spiritual truths, which in heaven are so many radiations of light, and they are also presented visibly by means of the light, as before stated. As the 
Lord was now to be imbued with knowledges in order that as to the Human Essence also He might become the very Light of heaven, it is here said that "Abram journeyed, going and journeying toward the south." 
 [2] That this is the signification of "the south," may be seen from similar passages in the Word, as in Isaiah: </p>
<p>     I will say to the north, Give; and to the south, Keep not back; bring My sons 
from far, and My daughters from the end of the earth (Isa. 43:6); </p>
<p>"the north" denotes those who are in ignorance; "the south" those who are in knowledges; "sons" truths; and "daughters" goods. Again: </p>
<p> 
    If thou draw out thy soul to the hungry, and satisfy the afflicted soul, then shall thy light rise in the darkness, and thy thick darkness as the noonday [or, south-meridies] (Isa. 58:10); </p>
<p>to 
"draw out the soul to the hungry and to satisfy the afflicted soul," denotes the goods of charity in general; the "light rising in the darkness," means that they shall have the intelligence of truth; 
and "the thick darkness as the south," means that they shall have the wisdom of good; "the south," from its heat, signifies good, and from its light, truth.  [3] In Ezekiel: </p>
<p>     In the visions 
of God brought He me into the land of Israel, and set me upon a very high mountain, whereon was as it were the building of a city on the south (Ezek. 40:2); </p>
<p>concerning the New Jerusalem, or the Lord's 
kingdom, which, because it is in the light of wisdom and intelligence, is "on the south." In David: </p>
<p>     Jehovah shall bring forth thy righteousness as the light, and thy judgment as the noonday (Ps. 
37:6). Again: </p>
<p>     Thou shalt not be afraid for the terror of the night, for the arrow that flieth by day, for the pestilence that walketh in the thick darkness, for the destruction that wasteth 
at noonday [or, in the south] (Ps. 91:5-6); </p>
<p>"not to fear for the destruction that wasteth in the south," means not to be afraid because of the damnation which comes upon those who are in knowledges and 
pervert them. In Ezekiel: </p>
<p>     Son of man, set thy face toward the south, and drop [thy word] to the south, and prophesy to the forest of the field of the south, and say to the forest of the south, 
All faces from the south to the north shall be burned in her (Ezek. 20:46-47); </p>
<p>"the forest of the south," denotes those who are in the light of truths, and who extinguish it, and thus those of this 
character who are within the church.  [4] In Daniel: </p>
<p>     Out of one of them there went forth a little horn, and it grew exceedingly toward the south, and toward the east, and toward beauty [decus], 
and it grew even to the army of the heavens (Dan. 8:9-10); </p>
<p>meaning those who fight against goods and truths. In Jeremiah: </p>
<p>     Give glory to Jehovah your God, before He maketh it grow dark, and before 
your feet stumble upon the mountains of twilight; and ye look for light, and He turn it into the shadow of death, He shall make it thick darkness; the cities of the south shall be shut, and there 
is none to open (Jer. 13:16, 19); </p>
<p>"the cities of the south" denote the knowledges of truth and good. In Obadiah: </p>
<p>     The captivity of Jerusalem which is in Sepharad shall inherit the cities of the 
south (Obad. 20); </p>
<p>"the cities of the south" denote in like manner truths and goods; hence the very truths and goods of which they are the heirs; the Lord's kingdom is here treated of.  [5] That Abram's 
journeying, going and journeying toward the south, signifies, as before said, the Lord's progression into goods and truths, and thus into a state of light as to the interiors, is to be thus understood: 
knowledges are the things that open the way for seeing celestial and spiritual things; by means of knowledges the way is opened for the internal man to advance toward the external, in which latter 
are the receiving vessels, which are as many as are the knowledges of good and truth; into these knowledges, as into their vessels, do celestial things inflow. </p>

<p align="center"><b>Elliott(1983-1999) 1458</b></p><p><b>1458.</b>
'Towards the south' means into goods and truths, thus into a state that is bright as regards interior things. This is clear from the meaning of 'the south'. That 'the south' means a state that is bright 
arises from the fact that the four quarters, as with periods of time, do not actually exist in the next life, only the states meant by the four quarters and periods of time. The successive states 
of ideas in the understanding are like the states that belong to the times of the day and to the seasons of the year, and also to those of the four quarters. The successive states of a day are evening, 
night, morning, and midday; the states of the year are autumn, winter, spring, and summer; and the states of the four quarters are those of the sun in relation to west, north, east, and south. Similar 
to these are the successive states of ideas in the understanding. And what is remarkable, in heaven those whose state is one of wisdom and intelligence are in light. The intensity of that light is 
in exact proportion to their state, with those in the greatest light whose state is one of highest wisdom and intelligence; but the wisdom there is that which goes with love and charity, and the intelligence 
that which goes with faith in the Lord That there is light in the next life to which the light of the world scarcely stands comparison is to me evident from much experience, and this will in the 
Lord's Divine mercy be presented later on. And because there exists in heaven such a correspondence between light and things of the understanding, nothing else is meant in the internal sense here and 
elsewhere in the Word by 'the south'. Here 'the south' means intelligence acquired through cognitions. Cognitions are celestial and spiritual truths, which are just so many radiations of light in heaven 
and which present themselves visibly by means of the light, as has been stated. Because the Lord was now to be endowed with cognitions so that He might become the Light itself of heaven as regards 
His Human Essence as well, it is here said that 'he travelled, going on and travelling, towards the south'. </p>
<p></p>
<p><b>[2]</b>
 That 'the south' means those things becomes clear from similar examples in the Word, 
as in Isaiah, </p>
<blockquote>
I will say to the north, Give up; and to the south, Do not withhold Bring My sons from afar and My daughters from the end of the earth. <a href="http://bible.gospelcom.net/cgi-bin/bible?passage=Isa%2043:6&amp;version=ESV&amp;interface=print&amp;showfn=yes&amp;showxref">Isa 43:6</a>. 
</blockquote>
<p>'The north' stands for those without 
knowledge, 'the south' for those who possess cognitions, 'sons' stands for truths, and 'daughters' for goods. In the same prophet, If you bring food out of store for the hungry<A name="fntext1"></a><A href="#fn1"><sup>a</sup></a> and satisfy the 
afflicted soul, then your light will rise in the darkness, and your thick darkness will be as the noonday.<A name="fntext2"></a><A href="#fn2"><sup>b</sup></a> <a href="http://bible.gospelcom.net/cgi-bin/bible?passage=Isa%2058:10&amp;version=ESV&amp;interface=print&amp;showfn=yes&amp;showxref">Isa 58:10</a>. </p>
<p>'Bringing food out of store for the hungry and satisfying the afflicted soul' 
stands for good deeds of charity in general. 'Your light will rise in the darkness' stands for the fact that truth has made them intelligent, and 'your thick darkness will be as the noonday'<A name="fntext2"></a><A href="#fn2"><sup>b</sup></a> that 
good has made them wise. 'The south' means good by virtue of its warmth, and truth by virtue of its light. </p>
<p></p>
<p><b>[3]</b>
 In Ezekiel, </p>
<blockquote>
In the visions of God He brought me into the land of Israel and set me 
down on a very high mountain, on which there was so to speak the structure of a city on the south. <a href="http://bible.gospelcom.net/cgi-bin/bible?passage=Ezek%2040:2&amp;version=ESV&amp;interface=print&amp;showfn=yes&amp;showxref">Ezek 40:2</a>. 
</blockquote>
<p>This refers to the new Jerusalem or the Lord's kingdom, which because it is bathed in 
the light of wisdom and intelligence is 'on the south'. In David, </p>
<blockquote>
Jehovah will bring forth your righteousness as the light, and your judgement as the noonday.<A name="fntext2"></a><A href="#fn2"><sup>b</sup></a> <a href="http://bible.gospelcom.net/cgi-bin/bible?passage=Ps%2037:6&amp;version=ESV&amp;interface=print&amp;showfn=yes&amp;showxref">Ps 37:6</a>. 
</blockquote>
<p>In the same author, </p>
<blockquote>
You 
will not be afraid of the terror of the night, of the arrow that flies by day, of the pestilence that walks in thick darkness, of the destruction that lays waste at noonday.<A name="fntext2"></a><A href="#fn2"><sup>b</sup></a> <a href="http://bible.gospelcom.net/cgi-bin/bible?passage=Ps%2091:5,%206&amp;version=ESV&amp;interface=print&amp;showfn=yes&amp;showxref">Ps 91:5, 6</a> 
</blockquote>
<p>'Not 
being afraid of the destruction that lays waste at noonday'<A name="fntext2"></a><A href="#fn2"><sup>b</sup></a> stands for not fearing the condemnation which comes upon those who possess cognitions but pervert them. In Ezekiel, </p>
<blockquote>
Son of man, set your 
face<A name="fntext3"></a><A href="#fn3"><sup>c</sup></a> towards the south and drop [your words] to the south and prophesy towards the forest of the field in the south; and you shall say to the forest of the south, All faces in it from south to 
north will be scorched in it. <a href="http://bible.gospelcom.net/cgi-bin/bible?passage=Ezek%2020:46,%2047&amp;version=ESV&amp;interface=print&amp;showfn=yes&amp;showxref">Ezek 20:46, 47</a> 
</blockquote>
<p>'The forest of the south' stands for those who possess the light of truths but extinguish it, and so stands for those within the Church who are such as 
these. </p>
<p></p>
<p><b>[4]</b>
 In Daniel, </p>
<blockquote>
Out of one of them there came forth a little horn, and it grew much towards the south, and towards the east, and towards the glorious [land]. And it grew even towards the 
host of heaven. <a href="http://bible.gospelcom.net/cgi-bin/bible?passage=Dan%208:9,%2010&amp;version=ESV&amp;interface=print&amp;showfn=yes&amp;showxref">Dan 8:9, 10</a>. 
</blockquote>
<p>This stands for people who assail goods and truths. In Jeremiah, </p>
<blockquote>
Give glory to Jehovah your God before He causes darkness and before your feet stumble on the twilight 
mountains, and you look for light and He turns it into the shadow of death and places it in thick darkness. The cities of the south will be shut up, with none opening them. <a href="http://bible.gospelcom.net/cgi-bin/bible?passage=Jer%2013:16,%2019&amp;version=ESV&amp;interface=print&amp;showfn=yes&amp;showxref">Jer 13:16, 19</a>.

<p>'Cities 
of the south' stands for cognitions of truth and good. In Obadiah, </p>
<p>Those carried away from Jerusalem who are in Sepharad will inherit the cities of the south. Obad. verse 20. </p>
<p>Here similarly 'the 
cities of the south' stands for truths and goods, and so for the truths and goods themselves to which they are heirs. The subject here is the Lord's kingdom. </p>
<p></p>
<p><b>[5]</b>
 As regards 'Abram travelled, going 
on and travelling, towards the south' meaning, as has been stated, the Lord's advance into goods and truths, thus into a state that is bright as regards interiors, cognitions are what open up the 
path to seeing celestial and spiritual things. By means of cognitions a path is opened up from the internal man to the external man in which recipient vessels reside, as many as there are cognitions of 
good and truth. It is into the latter as their own particular vessels that celestial things flow.

Quod 'versus meridiem' significet in bona et vera, ita in statum lucidum quoad interiora, constat a significatione 'meridiei'; quod meridies significet statum lucidum, venit ex eo quod plagae sicut 
tempora in altera vita nullae sint, sed status qui per plagas et tempora significantur; status intellectualium se habent sicut status temporum diei et anni, tum quoque plagarum; status diei sunt vesperae, 
noctis, {1}matutae et meridiei; status anni sunt autumni, hiemis, veris, aestatis; et status plagarum sunt solis versus occidentem, septentrionem, orientem et meridiem; similes illis sunt status 
intellectualium; et quod mirum, in caelo illi in luce sunt qui in statu sapientiae et intelligentiae, prorsus secundum statum, inque summa luce qui in statu summae sapientiae et intelligentiae, sed sapientia 
ibi est amoris et charitatis, et intelligentia est fidei in Dominum; quod lux in altera vita sit, cui lux mundi vix comparari potest, ex multa experientia mihi constat, de qua, ex Divina Domini 
Misericordia, in sequentibus; et quia talis correspondentia est lucis et intellectualium in caelo, in sensu interno hic et alibi in Verbo per 'meridiem' non aliud significatur.  Meridies significat 
hic intelligentiam quae comparatur per cognitiones; cognitiones sunt veritates caelestes et spirituales, quae sunt totidem radiationes lucis in caelo, et sistuntur quoque visibiles per lucem, ut dictum; 
quia Dominus nunc imbueretur cognitionibus, ut quoad Humanam Essentiam quoque fieret Ipsa Lux caeli, hic dicitur quod 'profectus eundo et proficiscendo versus meridiem':  [2] quod 'meridies' significet 
illa, constare potest a similibus in Verbo, ut apud Esaiam, Dicam septentrioni, Da, et meridiei, Ne inhibe; adduc filios Meos e longinquo, et filias Meas ab extremitate terrae, xliii 6; </p>
<p>'septentrio' 
pro illis qui in ignorantia, 'meridies' pro illis qui in cognitionibus, 'filii' pro veris, et 'filiae' pro bonis:  apud eundem, Si {2}expromseris famelico animam tuam, et animam afflictam saturaveris, 
et exorietur in tenebris lux tua, et caligo tua sicut meridies, lviii 10; </p>
<p>'expromere famelico animam, et animam afflictam saturare' pro bonis charitatis in genere:  'exorietur in tenebris lux' 
pro quod illis intelligentia veri:  'et 'caligo sicut meridies' pro quod illis sapientia boni:  'meridies ex calore' significat bonum, 'ex luce' verum: [3] apud Ezechielem, In visionibus Dei adduxit 
me in terram Israelis, et posuit me super monte alto valde, et super quo quasi structura civitatis a meridie, xl 2; </p>
<p>de nova Hierosolyma seu regno Domini quod quia in luce sapientiae et intelligentiae, 
est 'a meridie':  apud Davidem, Jehovah educet sicut lucem justitiam tuam, et judicium tuum sicut meridiem, Ps. xxxvii 6: </p>
<p>apud eundem, Non timebis a pavore noctis, a sagitta volaverit per diem: 
a peste in caligine ambulabit, ab excidio vastat in meridie, Ps. xci [5,] 6; </p>
<p>'non timere ab excidio quod vastat in meridie' pro a damnatione quae oritur apud eos qui in cognitionibus sunt et illas pervertunt: 
apud Ezechielem, Fili hominis, pone facies tuas versus meridiem, et stilla ad meridiem, et propheta ad silvam agri meridiei, et dicas silvae meridiei,... Comburentur in ea omnes facies a meridie 
ad septentrionem, xxi 2, 3 [A.V. xx 46, 47]; </p>
<p>'silva meridiei' pro illis qui in luce veritatum sunt, et eam exstinguunt ita pro iis qui intra Ecclesiam tales:  [4] apud Danielem, Ex uno de illis 
exivit cornu unum exiguum, et crevit multum ad meridiem, et ad ortum, et ad decus, et crevit usque ad exercitum caelorum, viii 9, 10; </p>
<p>pro illis qui oppugnant bona et vera:  apud Jeremiam, Date Jehovae 
Deo vestro gloriam, antequam obtenebrescere facit, et antequam offendant pedes vestri super montes crepusculi et exspectabitis lucem, et ponet eam in umbram lethalem, ponet in caliginem;... urbes 
meridiei clausae erunt, et non aperiens, xiii 16, 19; </p>
<p>'urbes meridiei' pro cognitionibus veri et boni:  apud Obadiam, Deportati Hierosolymae, qui in Sepharad, hereditabunt urbes meridiei, vers. 20; </p>
<p>'urbes 
meridiei similiter pro veris et bonis, inde pro ipsis veris et bonis quorum heredes; agitur ibi de regno Domini.  [5] 'Quod Abram profectus eundo et proficiscendo versus meridiem' significet, 
ut dictum, Domini progressionem in bona et vera, ita in statum lucidum quoad interiora, ita se habet quod cognitiones sint quae aperiunt viam ad spectandum caelestia et spiritualia; per cognitiones 
aperitur via interno homini ad externum, in quo sunt vasa recipientia, quae tot sunt quot cognitiones boni et veri; in has ut in sua vasa influunt caelestia. @1 Matuta = 'Goddess of the morning,' another 
form of Aurora, but S. uses it for mane.$ @2 Heb.     (puq) = to cause to go out, to move.$ </p>
