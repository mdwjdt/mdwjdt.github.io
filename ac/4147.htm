<h3 align="center" class="ired">属天的奥秘 第4147节</h3>
<h4 align="center"></h4><p><strong>4147.</strong>创世记31:31，32.雅各回答拉班说，因为我怕呀；我说，恐怕你把你的女儿从我强夺去。至于你的神明，你在谁那里搜出来，谁就在我们弟兄面前不得存活；你在我这里搜到什么，就拿去。原来雅各不知道拉结偷了它们。<br />“雅各回答拉班说，因为我怕呀；我说，恐怕你把你的女儿从我强夺去”表若分离在那良善的自由中，或经那良善自由同意进行，状态的性质，因为就对真理的情感而言，这会造成伤害。“至于你的神明，你在谁那里搜出来，谁就在我们弟兄面前不得存活”表那真理不是“拉班的”，“拉班”的真理不可能居于“雅各的”良善中。“你在我这里搜到什么，就拿去”表属于那良善的一切事物都已被分离出去。“原来雅各不知道拉结偷了它们”表它们属于对内层真理的情感。</p>

Verses 31, 32. And Jacob answered and said to Laban, Because I was afraid, for I said, Perchance thou wilt take away thy daughters from me by force. With whomsoever thou findest thy gods, he shall not 
live before our brethren; search thou what is with me, and take it to thee. And Jacob knew not that Rachel had stolen them. "And Jacob answered and said to Laban, Because I was afraid, for I said, Perchance 
thou wilt take away thy daughters from me by force," signifies the state if the separation were made in the freedom of that good, in that it would be injured in respect to the affections of truth; 
"with whomsoever thou findest thy gods, he shall not live before our brethren," signifies that the truth was not his [Laban's], and that his truth could not subsist in his [Jacob's] good; "search 
thou what is with me, and take it to thee," signifies that all things of that good were separated; "and Jacob knew not that Rachel had stolen them," signifies that they were of the affection of interior truth. </p>

<p align="center"><b>Elliott(1983-1999) 4147</b></p><p><b>4147.</b>
Verses 31, 32 And Jacob answered and said to Laban, Because I was afraid; for I said, Perhaps you will take your daughters from me by force. Anyone with whom you find your gods shall not live in the 
presence of our brothers. Examine for yourself what is with me, and take them to yourself. And Jacob did not know that Rachel had stolen them. </p>
<p>'Jacob answered and said to Laban, Because I was afraid; 
for I said, Perhaps you will take your daughters from me by force' means the nature of the state if the separation had taken place with the free consent of that good, in that harm would have been done 
to it so far as affections for truth were concerned. 'Anyone with whom you find your gods shall not live in the presence of our brothers' means that that truth was not 'Laban's', and that what was 
'Laban's' truth could not reside in his - 'Jacob's' - good. 'Examine for yourself what is with me, and take them to yourself' means that everything belonging to that good had been separated. 'And Jacob 
did not know that Rachel had stolen them' means that they belonged to the affection for interior truth. </p>

Vers. 31, 32. Et respondit Jacob et dixit Labani, Quia timui, quia dixi, Forte rapies filias tuas a mecum.  Cum quo invenis deos tuos, non vivet coram fratribus nostris; lustra tibi quid mecum, et 
accipe tibi; et non scivit Jacob quod Rachel furata illos. `Respondit Jacob et dixit Labani, Quia timui, quia dixi, Forte rapies filias tuas a mecum' significat statum si ex libero boni illius separatio 
facta, quod quoad affectiones veri laederetur: `cum quo invenis deos tuos, non vivet coram fratribus nostris' significat quod verum non ejus esset, et {1} quod ejus verum non subsisteret in 
suo bono: `lustra tibi quid mecum, et accipe tibi significat quod illius {2} boni omnia separata: `et non scivit Jacob quod Rachel furata illos' significat quod affectionis veri interioris essent.
