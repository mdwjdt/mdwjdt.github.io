<h3 align="center" class="ired">属天的奥秘 第5317节</h3>
<h4 align="center"></h4><p><strong>5317.</strong>“法老就摘下手上的戒指”表对属世层先前所拥有权柄的一种确认。这从“法老”的代表，以及“戒指”和“手”的含义清楚可知：“法老”是指属世层，如前所述；“戒指”是指确认，如下文所述；“手”是指权柄或能力（参看<a href="878.htm">878</a>，<a href="3091.htm">3091</a>，<a href="3387.htm">3387</a>，<a href="4931.htm">4931</a>-<a href="4937.htm">4937</a>，<a href="5296.htm">5296</a>节）。由此明显可知，“法老就摘下手上的戒指”表示属世层放弃它之前所拥有的权柄；如下文所说的把它“戴在约瑟的手上”表示属世层将一切权柄都交给属灵层的属天层。“手上的戒指”表示对权柄的确认，这一事实从圣言的相应经文不容易看出来，因为除了路加福音外，别处都没有提到手上的戒指；在路加福音，耗尽一切所有的浪子的父亲对仆人说：<br />把那上好的袍子拿出来给他穿；把戒指戴在他手上，把鞋穿在他脚上。（路加福音<a href="http://39-27.cn/路15.22.htm">15:22</a>）<br />此处“戒指”也表示对家里诸如儿子所拥有的那种权柄的一种确认，如刚才所述。手上戒指的这一含义从自古时流传下来，一直传到我们这里的习俗明显看出来，如订婚和结婚，以及就职典礼时的习俗，那时就要把戒指戴在手上。这些戒指也表示对权柄的确认。此外，也是戴在手上的带印戒指或印章（耶利米书<a href="http://39-27.cn/耶22.24.htm">22:24</a>）也表示同意和确认（参看<a href="4874.htm">4874</a>节）。</p>

And Pharaoh took off his ring from upon his hand. That this signifies a confirming of the power the natural previously had, is evident from the representation of Pharaoh, as being the natural (of which 
above); and from the signification of a "ring," as being that which confirms (of which hereafter); and from the signification of the "hand," as being power (see n. 878, 3091, 3387, 4931-4937, 5296). 
From this it is plain that by his "taking off his ring from upon his hand" is signified that the natural gave up the power it had before; and that by his "putting it upon Joseph's hand," as below, is 
signified that the natural yielded all the power to the celestial of the spiritual. That a ring upon the hand denotes confirmation of power, cannot be so well established from parallel passages in the 
Word; because rings upon the hand are nowhere else mentioned, save only in Luke, where the father of the son who had wasted all his substance said to the servants: </p>
<p>	Bring forth the chief robe, and 
put it on him; and put a ring upon his hand, and shoes upon his feet (Luke 15:22); </p>
<p>where also a "ring" signifies confirmation of his power in the household as a son, just as above. Nevertheless this 
signification of a ring upon the hand is evident from the rites that have come down to us from ancient times, as from the rites of betrothals and unions, and also of inaugurations, in which rings are 
put upon the hand, and by them is signified confirmation of power. Moreover, that signets, which also were worn on the hand (Jer. 22:24), signify consent and confirmation, see n. 4874. </p>

'And Pharaoh took off his ring from upon his hand' means a confirmation regarding the power which belonged at first to the natural. This is clear from the representation of 'Pharaoh' as the natural, 
dealt with already; from the meaning of 'ring' as a confirmation, dealt with below; and from the meaning of 'hand' as power, dealt with in <a href="878.htm">878</a>, <a href="3091.htm">3091</a>, <a href="3387.htm">3387</a>, <a href="4931.htm">4931</a>-<a href="4937.htm">4937</a>, <a href="5296.htm">5296</a>. From this it is evident that 
'he took off the ring from upon his hand' means that the natural renounced the power which at first belonged to itself, and that 'he put it onto Joseph's hand', as stated next, means that it passed 
all that power over to the celestial of the spiritual. The fact that 'the ring upon the hand' means a confirmation regarding power is not easy to show from parallel places in the Word, because no references 
are made to rings worn on the hand, apart from the following in Luke, where the father of the son who had squandered everything said to his servants, </p>
<blockquote>
Bring out the best robe and put it on him, 
and put a ring upon his hand and shoes on his feet. <a href="http://bible.gospelcom.net/cgi-bin/bible?passage=Luke%2015:22&amp;version=ESV&amp;interface=print&amp;showfn=yes&amp;showxref">Luke 15:22</a>. 
</blockquote>
<p>Here also, as before, 'a ring' means a confirmation regarding power in the house, such as a son possesses. The same meaning is evident 
even from the customs which have come down to us from ancient times, such as the customs followed at betrothals and weddings, also at inaugurations, when rings are placed upon the hand. By these 
rings too a confirmation regarding power is meant. In addition to this, signets, which were likewise worn on the hand, <a href="http://bible.gospelcom.net/cgi-bin/bible?passage=Jer%2022:24&amp;version=ESV&amp;interface=print&amp;showfn=yes&amp;showxref">Jer 22:24</a>, mean consent and confirmation, see <a href="4874.htm">4874</a>. </p>

</p><b>5317.</b>
`Et removit Pharaoh annulum suum a super manu sua': quod significet confirmativum de potentia quae prius ei, constat ex repraesentatione `Pharaonis' quod sit naturale, de qua prius; ex significatione 
`annuli' quod sit confirmativum, de qua sequitur; et ex significatione `manus' quod sit potentia, de qua n. 878, 3091, 3387, 4931-4937, 5296; inde patet quod per `removit {1}annulum a super manu sua' 
significetur quod potentiam quae prius sibi, abdicaverit, et quod per `dedit illum super manum Josephi', ut sequitur, significetur quod potentiam cesserit omnem caelesti spiritualis. Quod `annulus' 
super manu sit confirmativum potentiae, non ita constare potest ex locis in Verbo parallelis, quia annuli qui super manu, {2}non alibi nominantur, praeter modo apud Lucam,  Ubi pater filii qui prodegerat 
omnia, {3}dixit ad servos, Efferte stolam primariam et induite illum; et date annulum super manum ejus, et calceos super pedes, (x)xv 22,  ubi etiam per `annulum' significatur confirmativum potentiae 
in domo, sicut filii, ut prius; at usque patet ex ritualibus quae ab antiquis temporibus apud nos sunt, ut ex ritualibus desponsationum et copulationum, ut et inaugurationum, in quibus annuli dantur 
super manum, per quos etiam confirmativum potentiae significatur; praeterea quod sigilla quae quoque erant super manu, Jer. xxii 24, significent consensum et confirmationem, videatur n. 4874.   @1
