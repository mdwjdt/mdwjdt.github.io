<h3 align="center" class="ired">属天的奥秘 第10265节</h3>
<h4 align="center"></h4><p><strong>10265</strong>.“照着香膏配制师的手工”表由于神性本身的流注和运作，这神性本身自成孕时就在主里面。这从“香膏配制师”或制膏者的含义清楚可知，“香膏配制师”或制膏者是指一个做这项工作的人，故当论及主时，它表示神性本身，“手工”表示祂的运作。凡在圣言中所说的话，都要理解为与它所指的东西有关；因此，当这话论及神时，要理解为神和祂的运作，以及流注和属性；无论字义是怎么表述的。在至内层天堂，天使将圣言中的一切都与主的神性人身联系在一起，因为他们的思维直接来自主，他们感知圣言的至内在意义，也就是属天意义。故他们对此处“照着香膏配制师的手工合成的香膏”没有其它感知，只理解为自成孕时就在主里面的神性本身，以及在祂人身的每一个部分里面的一种流注和运作；因为主的人身就是与他们同在神性本身。他们知道，被称为“父”的神性之爱的神性良善以一种相互的方式存在于被称为子的主之神性人身里面，正如主所说的：“父在祂里面，祂在父里面”（约翰福音<a href="http://39-27.cn/约14.10.htm">14:10</a>，<a href="http://39-27.cn/约14.11.htm">11</a>）；他们“为一”（约翰福音<a href="http://39-27.cn/约10.30.htm">10:30</a>）。不要奇怪“香膏配制师”或制膏者表示神性本身，因为在圣言的各个地方，耶和华都自称为“形成者”（Former）、“制造者”或匠人（Workman），甚至自称“窑匠”，如在以赛亚书：<br />耶和华啊，现在你仍是我们的父！我们是泥，你是窑匠，我们都是你手的工作。（以赛亚书<a href="http://39-27.cn/赛64.8.htm">64:8</a>）<br />以及在以赛亚书的别处和耶利米书（<a href="http://39-27.cn/耶18.2.htm">18:2-6</a>）。</p>

The work of a perfumer. That this signifies from the influx and operation of the Divine Itself which was in the Lord from conception, is evident from the signification of "a perfumer," or "a maker of 
ointment," as being the one who does this work; and therefore when it is said of the Lord, the Divine Itself is signified, and by "work," its operation. Whatever is said in the Word is to be understood 
relatively to that of which it is said; and therefore when it is said of the Divine, it is to be understood of the Divine and of its operation, influx, and attributes; no matter how it may be expressed 
in the sense of the letter. In the inmost heaven all things of the Word are applied to the Divine Human of the Lord, for the angels there think immediately from the Lord, and perceive the Word in 
its inmost sense, which is the celestial sense; and therefore here by "ointment of ointment, the work of a maker of ointment," they perceive nothing else than that which is of the Divine Itself which 
was in the Lord from conception, and its influx and operation into each and all things of His Human; for the Human of the Lord is the Divine Itself with them. They know that the Divine good of the Divine 
love, which is called the "Father," is reciprocally in the Divine Human of the Lord, which is the "Son," according to the Lord's words, that "the Father is in Him and He in the Father" (John 14:10, 
11); and that they "are one" (John 10:30). Wonder not that by a "maker of ointment" or of "perfumes" is signified the Divine Itself, seeing that in the Word throughout Jehovah calls Himself the "Former," 
and the "Maker," nay, even the "Potter," as in Isaiah: </p>
<p>     O Jehovah Thou art our Father; we are the clay, and Thou our Potter; and we all are the work of Thy hands (Isa. 64:8); </p>
<p>and also in 
other passages in the same prophet, and in Jeremiah 18:2-6. </p>

'The work of an ointment-maker' means as a result of the influx and operation of Divinity itself, who was within the Lord from conception. This is clear from the meaning of 'an ointment-maker (or perfumer)' 
as one who performs that work, and therefore when this expression is used in regard to the Lord, Divinity itself is meant by it, and His operation by 'the work'. Any expression at all that occurs 
in the Word should be understood in relation to whatever it refers to, and therefore whenever an expression refers to God, God and His operation, influx, and attributes should be understood, no matter 
what the literal sense declares. In the inmost heaven angels relate everything in the Word to the Lord's Divine Human, for their thoughts come directly from the Lord, and they perceive the Word on 
its inmost level of meaning, which is the celestial sense. Here therefore they have no other perception of 'a compounded ointment, the work of an ointment-maker' than that of Divinity itself, within 
the Lord from conception, and of an influx and operation within every single part of His Human. For with them the Lord's Human is Divinity itself. They know that the Divine Good of Divine Love, called 
the Father, exists within the Lord's Divine Human, called the Son, in a reciprocal manner, as accords with the Lord's words stating that The Father is within Him and He within the Father, <a href="http://bible.gospelcom.net/cgi-bin/bible?passage=John%2014:10,11&amp;version=ESV&amp;interface=print&amp;showfn=yes&amp;showxref">John 14:10,11</a>, 
and that They are one, <a href="http://bible.gospelcom.net/cgi-bin/bible?passage=John%2010:30&amp;version=ESV&amp;interface=print&amp;showfn=yes&amp;showxref">John 10:30</a>. Do not be surprised that 'an ointment-maker (or perfumer)' means Divinity itself, seeing that Jehovah in various places in the Word calls Himself 'One who forms', 
'a Workman', even indeed 'a Potter', as in Isaiah,  </p>
<blockquote>
O Jehovah, You are our Father, we are the clay and You are our Potter; and we are all the work of Your hands. <a href="http://bible.gospelcom.net/cgi-bin/bible?passage=Isa%2064:8&amp;version=ESV&amp;interface=print&amp;showfn=yes&amp;showxref">Isa 64:8</a>.

Also elsewhere in 
the same prophet, and in <a href="http://bible.gospelcom.net/cgi-bin/bible?passage=Jeremiah%2018:2-4,6&amp;version=ESV&amp;interface=print&amp;showfn=yes&amp;showxref">Jeremiah 18:2-4,6</a>.

`Opus unguentarii': quod significet ex influxu et operatione ipsius Divini quod in Domino ex conceptione, constat ex significatione `unguentarii' seu aromatarii, quod sit qui operatur illud, quapropter 
cum id de Domino dicitur, significatur ipsum Divinum, et per `opus' ejus operatio; quicquid in Verbo dicitur, respective ad illud de quo dicitur, intelligendum est, quapropter cum de Divino dicitur, 
de Divino ac de Ipsius operatione, influxu, et attributis intelligendum est, qualitercumque in sensu litterae sonat; in intimo caelo applicantur omnia Verbi ad Divinum Humanum Domini, nam angeli cogitant 
ibi immediate ex Domino, et Verbum percipiunt in sensu ejus intimo, qui est sensus caelestis; quapropter ibi per `unguentum unguenti opus unguentarii' non aliud percipiunt quam quod ipsius Divini, 
quod in Domino fuit (c)ex conceptione, ac influxum et operationem in omnia et singula Humani Ipsius; {1} Humanum enim Domini est ipsum Divinum apud illos; {2} sciunt quod Divinum Bonum Divini Amoris, 
quod Pater vocatur, sit in Divino Humano Domini, quod Filius, reciproce, secundum Domini verba, quod Pater in Ipso et Ipse in Patre, Joh. xiv 10, 11, et quod unum sint, Joh. x 30. Ne miremini quod 
per `unguentarium' seu aromatarium {3} significetur ipsum Divinum, cum Jehovah passim in Verbo Se appellet `Formatorem,' {4} `Opificem,' immo etiam `Figulum,' ut apud Esaiam, 	Jehovah, Pater noster 
Tu, nos lutum et Tu Figulus noster, et opus manuum Tuarum omnes nos, lxiv 7 [A. V. 8]; </p>
<p>et quoque alibi apud eundem, {5} et apud Jeremiam xviii 2-4, 6. @1 i ac inde$ @2 i quoniam ibi$ @3 i in sensu 
interno$ @4 i et$ @5 i ut cap. lxiv 7.$ </p>
