<h3 align="center" class="ired">属天的奥秘 第1073节</h3>
<h4 align="center"></h4><p><strong>1073.</strong>“在帐棚中间赤着身子”表由此而来的堕落。这一点从“赤身”或裸体的含义清楚可知。当信之真理不再居于人里面，尤其在他里面被滥用时，他就被称为“因喝醉而赤身露体”。信之真理本身好比遮盖仁之良善，或仁爱本身的衣服；因为仁爱是身体本身，因此真理是它的衣服；换句话说，仁爱是灵魂本身，信之真理则如同身体，也就是灵魂的衣服。而且，在圣言中，信之真理被称为“衣服”和“遮盖”，故23节的经文说“闪和雅弗拿件衣服，遮盖父亲的赤身”。相对属天之物而言，属灵之物如同包裹灵魂的身体，或如同包裹身体的衣服；事实上，在天堂，属灵之物就是用衣服来象征的。本节经既说“他赤着身子”，就意味着他丧失了信之真理，因为他渴望通过感官事物和由此而来的推理来探究它们。在圣言中，“因喝醉而露体”表类似概念，如耶利米哀歌：<br />住乌斯陆地的以东女人哪，只管欢喜快乐；这杯也必传到你那里；你必喝醉，以致露体。（耶利米哀歌<a href="http://39-27.cn/哀4.21.htm">4:21</a>）<br />哈巴谷书：<br />给人酒喝，又加上毒物，使邻舍喝醉，好看见他下体的有祸了（哈巴谷书<a href="http://39-27.cn/哈2.15.htm">2:15</a>）。</p>

<p><strong>[NCE]1073.</strong> The symbolism of he was uncovered in the middle of his tent as the resulting perversions can be seen from the symbolism of being uncovered, or naked. The person who is portrayed as uncovered and denuded by drunkenness on wine is one who has no religious truth, and even more so one in whom that truth is perverted.<br />The actual truth that composes faith is compared to clothes, in that it provides a covering for the good that comes of charity, or for charity itself. Charity is the body itself, and truth, as a result, is the clothing. Or, to say exactly the same thing, charity is the soul itself, while religious truth is like the body that clothes the soul. The Word calls religious truths clothes or a covering, which is why verse <a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_1073/bible_king-james-version_genesis_9_23" target=_top>23</a> below says that Shem and Japheth took a garment and covered their father's nakedness.<br />The relationship of spiritual entities to heavenly ones is like that of the body to the soul it clothes, or like that of garments to the body they clothe. In heaven, spiritual things are also represented by clothes. Since the present verse says that [Noah] lay uncovered, the meaning is that people deprived themselves of the truth that faith espouses through their desire to explore this truth through empirical data and therefore shallow logic.<br />Lying naked from being drunk on wine symbolizes the same things [elsewhere] in the Word, as in Jeremiah:<br />Rejoice and be glad, daughter of Edom, living in the land of Uz. The goblet will also pass over you. You will become drunk and go naked. (<a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_1073/bible_king-james-version_lamentations_4_21" target=_top>Lamentations 4:21</a>)<br />And in Habakkuk:<br />Doom to those who cause their companion to drink, ... and also intoxicating them in order to look on their naked parts. (<a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_1073/bible_king-james-version_habakkuk_2_15" target=_top>Habakkuk 2:15</a>) </p>

And he was uncovered in the midst of his tent. That this signifies things thereby perverted, is evident from the signification of "uncovered" that is, naked. For he is called "uncovered and naked from 
the drunkenness of wine" in whom there are no truths of faith, and still more so is he in whom they are perverted. The truths of faith themselves are compared to garments which cover the goods of charity, 
or charity itself; for charity is the body itself, and therefore truths are its garments; or what amounts to the same thing, charity is the soul itself and the truths of faith are as the body, 
which is the clothing of the soul. The truths of faith are also called in the Word "garments" and a "covering" and therefore it is said in the twenty-third verse that Shem and Japheth took a garment and 
covered the nakedness of their father. Spiritual things relatively to celestial are as a body that clothes the soul, or as garments that clothe the body; and in heaven they are represented by garments. 
In this verse, because it is said that he lay uncovered, it is signified that he stripped himself of the truths of faith by desiring to investigate them by means of the things of sense and by reasonings 
therefrom. The like is signified in the Word by lying naked from drunkenness with wine, as in Jeremiah: </p>
<p>     Rejoice and be glad, O daughter of Edom, that dwellest in the land of Uz; the cup 
shall pass through unto thee also; thou shalt be drunken, and shalt make thyself naked (Lam. 4:21). And in Habakkuk: </p>
<p>     Woe unto him that maketh his companion drink, and also maketh him drunken, in 
order to look upon their nakednesses (Hab. 2:15). </p>

<p align="center"><b>Elliott(1983-1999) 1073</b></p><p><b>1073.</b>
'He was uncovered in the middle of his tent' means resulting perversities. This is clear from the meaning of being 'uncovered' or naked. For someone is called uncovered and naked from drunkenness caused 
by wine when no truths of faith reside with him, and more so when perversities reside there. Truths of faith themselves are compared to garments that clothe charity or the goods that stem from charity, 
for charity is the body itself, and truths therefore the garments. Or what is equally the case, charity is the soul itself, while truths of faith are like the body that is the clothing for the soul. 
What is more, in the Word the truths of faith are called 'garments' and 'a covering'; hence the statement in verse 23 below that 'Shem and Japheth took a garment and covered their father's nakedness'. 
The relationship of spiritual things to celestial is like that of the body that clothes the soul, or like garments clothing the body, and indeed in heaven spiritual things are represented by garments. 
Here, because it is said that 'he lay uncovered', it means that he divested himself of the truths of faith through desiring to probe into them by means of sensory evidence and reasonings based 
on this. Similar concepts are meant in the Word by 'lying naked as a result of being drunk from wine', as in Jeremiah,  </p>
<blockquote>
Rejoice and be glad, O daughter of Edom, dweller in the land of Uz. Over you 
also the cup will pass, you will become drunk and strip yourself naked. <a href="http://bible.gospelcom.net/cgi-bin/bible?passage=Lam%204:11&amp;version=ESV&amp;interface=print&amp;showfn=yes&amp;showxref">Lam 4:11</a>.  
</blockquote>
<p>And in Habakkuk, </p>
<blockquote>
Woe to him who makes his neighbour drink, and by also making them drunk to look upon their nakedness. 
<a href="http://bible.gospelcom.net/cgi-bin/bible?passage=Hab%202:15&amp;version=ESV&amp;interface=print&amp;showfn=yes&amp;showxref">Hab 2:15</a>. 
</blockquote>

'Discoopertus fuit in medio tentorii sui': quod significet perversa inde, constat ex significatione 'discooperti' seu nudi; is enim discoopertus et nudus ab ebrietate ex vino vocatur, apud quem non 
vera fidei, et magis apud quem perversa; ipsa vera fidei comparantur vestibus quae tegunt bona charitatis seu charitatem, nam charitas est ipsum corpus, vera ideo sunt vestes; vel quod perinde est, charitas 
est ipsa anima, vera fidei sunt sicut corpus quod est amictus animae; etiam vera fidei in verbo appellantur 'vestes,' et 'integumentum'; quare in vers. seq. 23 dicitur 'quod Shem et Japheth acceperint 
vestem et texerint nuditatem patris sui'; spiritualia se habent respective ad caelestia sicut corpus quod amicit animam, aut sicut vestes quae corpus, in caelo quoque repraesentantur per vestes; 
hic, quia 'discoopertus jacuisse' dicitur, significatur quod se deprivaverit veris fidei per id quod investigare voluerit illa per sensualia, et inde ratiocinia.  Similia in Verbo significantur per 
'jacere nudatus ex ebrietate vini,' ut apud Jeremiam, 	Gaude et laetare filia Edomi, habitans in terra Uz, etiam super te transibit calix, inebriaberis et nudaberis, 	Thren. iv 21; </p>
<p>et apud Habakkuk, 	Vae 
facienti bibere socium suum,... et etiam inebriando, propterea ad aspiciendum super nuditates eorum, 	ii (x) 15. </p>
