<h4 align="center"></h4><p><strong>1077.</strong>被称为“含”和“迦南”的人，也就是将信与仁分开，因此使敬拜专注于外在事物的人不可能知道良知是什么、从何而来，故必须予以简要说明。良知通过信之真理形成，因为人所听到、承认和相信的事物构成他里面的良知。之后，违背这些事物行事对他来说，就是违背良知，这一点是显而易见的。因此，人所听到、承认并相信的若不是信之真理，他绝不可能有真正的良知。因为人通过信之真理（主在仁爱中的作工）重生，并因此经由信之真理接受良知。良知也就是新人自己。由此明显可知，信之真理是实现这一切所凭借的手段，也就是说，人藉着它们按照信的教导去生活，而信的基本教导是爱主高于一切，并爱邻如己。若他不照着这些真理生活，信岂不成了空洞之物，只是一个冠冕堂皇的词，或脱离天堂生活之物？一旦脱离天堂生活，它里面还会有救恩吗？<br />认为只要有信，无论人的生活如何，他都能得救，就是说他即便没有仁爱和良知也能得救。这等于说，即使他的一生都是在仇恨、报复、抢劫、通奸，总之，就是违背仁爱和良知的一切事物中度过，只要他有信，哪怕这信是在临终的那一刻才获得的，他仍能得救。让这种人认真反思一下，当被这种错误的假设支配时，那形成他们良知的信之真理究竟是什么，它岂不是假的东西？即便他们以为自己有点良知，这良知也无非是外在约束，如对法律、名利丧失，或由于这些而名声扫地的畏惧，这些畏惧构成了他们所谓的良知，这种良知会促使他们不去伤害邻舍，而是善待他。然而，由于这不是良知，因为它不是仁爱，所以一旦这些约束放松或解除，这种人就会冲进最邪恶、最淫秽的行为中。但那些虽然声称唯信得救，但仍过着仁爱生活的人则截然不同；因为他们的信中有来自主的仁爱。</p>

<p><strong>[NCE]1077.</strong> Since the people called Ham and Canaan here — that is, the people who detach faith from charity and therefore consider external acts alone to be worship — cannot see what conscience is or where it comes from, a few words must be said on the subject.<br />Conscience is formed through religious truth, because the things we hear, acknowledge, and believe are what create conscience in us. From then on, to violate those convictions is, for us, to violate conscience, as anyone can see clearly enough. That is why we can never acquire a true conscience unless the things we hear, acknowledge, and believe are the true tenets of faith. It is by means of religious truth — when the Lord stirs our sense of charity — that we are regenerated. So it is through religious truth that we receive conscience, and conscience is our actual new self.<br />This demonstrates that the true ideas embraced by faith are means to this end, namely, of living by the lessons that faith teaches, and the chief lesson is to love the Lord above all and to love our neighbor as ourselves. If we do not live by those lessons, what is faith but a meaningless curiosity and a hollow word, or something disconnected from heavenly life? Nothing detached from that life can ever provide salvation.<br />[2] To believe that we can be saved no matter how we live, as long as we possess faith, is to say that we are saved even if we lack any charity, and even if we lack all conscience. It is to claim that even if we spend our lives hating people, taking revenge, looting, committing adultery — in short, violating charity and conscience in every way — still, as long as we possess faith, even a faith adopted in the final hour of death, we can be saved.{*1} Ponder this, then: If you abide by a principle as false as that, just what kind of religious truth is it that forms your conscience? Is it not falsity? Any trace of conscience that you imagine you have consists only of superficial restraints — fear of the law and fear for your rank, your money, and the prestige these things bring you. Such inhibitions create in you what you call a conscience, preventing you from hurting your fellow creatures and prompting you to do good to them. But because this is not conscience, since it is not love for others, people like you plunge eagerly into the worst possible crimes and obscenities when those external restraints loosen or dissolve.<br />But your situation [after death] is radically different if you said that faith alone saves and yet lived a life of charity anyway, because in that case your faith contained charity, bestowed by the Lord.<br /><br /><strong>Footnotes:</strong><br />{*1} Swedenborg frequently decries the belief, which he ascribed particularly to the Lutheran church into which he was born, that having faith rather than doing good works is the main necessity of salvation; this was known as "the doctrine of faith alone," or solifidism. One weakness he saw in solifidism was the possibility that Christians would feel they had a license to sin because a deathbed repentance would ultimately save them. There was in fact a large popular literature dating from medieval times, now referred to as the ars moriendi, or "art of dying," that gave advice on the proper way to die; while it often encouraged faith throughout life, it not surprisingly also promoted repentance of sins on the deathbed (Karant-Nunn 1997, 138-189). It is this ars moriendi tradition against which Swedenborg seems to be reacting here. Compare similar comments about deathbed repentance at <a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_1077/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_4171#subsection-2-3" target=_top>Secrets of Heaven 4171:3</a>, <a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_1077/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_4925#subsection-2-2" target=_top>4925:2</a>; and see also Draft of "Supplements" (Swedenborg 1997) 218. Swedenborg's full treatment of repentance can be found in the chapter on the subject in <a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_1077/swedenborg_true-christian-religion-chadwick_509" target=_top>True Christianity 509-570</a>.

That they who are here called "Ham" and "Canaan" that is, those who separate faith from charity and hence make worship consist in externals alone, cannot know what and whence is conscience, needs to 
be briefly shown. Conscience is formed by means of the truths of faith, for that which a man has heard, acknowledged, and believed makes the conscience in him; and afterwards to act contrary to this is 
to him to act contrary to conscience, as may be sufficiently evident to everyone; so that unless it is the truths of faith that a man hears, acknowledges, and believes, he cannot possibly have a true 
conscience. For it is through the truths of faith (the Lord working in charity) that man is regenerated, and therefore it is through the truths of faith that he receives conscience, conscience being 
the new man himself. From this it is evident that the truths of faith are the means by which this may take place, that is, that the man may live according to what faith teaches, the principal of which 
is to love the Lord above all things, and the neighbor as himself. If he does not so live, what is his faith but an empty affair, and a mere high-sounding word, or a thing that is separated from heavenly 
life, and in which when thus separated there is no possible salvation?  [2] For to believe that no matter how a man lives, he may yet be saved provided he has faith, is to say that he may be saved 
if he has no charity, and no conscience (that is, if he passes his life in hatred, revenge, robbery, adultery, in a word, in all things contrary to charity and conscience) provided only that he has 
faith, even if it be but at the hour of death. Let such persons consider, when they are in such a false principle, what truth of faith there is that can form their conscience, and whether it be not 
what is false. If they suppose that they have anything of conscience, it must be only outward bonds-such as fear of the law, of loss of honor, of gain, or of reputation for the sake of these-that make, 
with them, what they call conscience, and which lead them not to injure the neighbor, but to do him good. But as this is not conscience, because not charity, therefore when these restraints are loosened 
or taken away, such persons rush into most wicked and obscene things. Very different is the case with those who, although they have declared that faith alone saves, have still lived a life of charity; 
for in their faith there has been charity from the Lord. </p>

The reason the people who are here called 'Ham' and 'Canaan', that is, who separate, faith from charity and who in so doing focus worship solely on external things, cannot know what conscience is and 
where it originates, must be discussed briefly. Conscience is formed by means of the truths of faith, for what a person has heard, acknowledged, and believed constitutes conscience with him. After that, 
acting contrary to those things is for him acting contrary to conscience, as may become quite clear to anyone. Consequently unless it is the truths of faith that he hears, acknowledges, and believes, 
he cannot possibly have a true conscience. For it is by means of the truths of faith, with the Lord working within charity, that a person is regenerated, and so by means of them receives conscience. 
Conscience is also the new person himself. From this it is clear that truths of faith are the means by which this is achieved, that is, by which a person lives according to the things faith teaches, 
its fundamental teaching being to love the Lord above all things and the neighbour as oneself. If he does not live according to those truths, what is faith but something hollow, and an audible sound, 
or something separated from heavenly life, in which, once separated, there is nothing saving? For to believe that a person can still be saved no matter how he lives, provided he has faith, is to say 
that he is saved even though he has no charity and even though h, has no conscience. It amounts to saying that, provided he has faith, even though he does not have it until the last hour of life, he 
can be saved, despite spending his time hating, getting revenge, plundering, and committing adultery, in short, doing everything contrary to charity and conscience. Let such people, when governed by an 
assumption as false as this, ponder what truth of faith exists that can form their conscience. Will it not be that which is false? If they imagine that they have any conscience at all, it amounts to 
no more than external restraints - fear of the law, of loss of position, wealth, and reputation on account of these, which fears constitute with them what they call conscience, a conscience which says 
that they should do no harm to the neighbour but behave well towards him. Since however this is not conscience, because it is not charity, such persons consequently rush into the most wicked and disgusting 
actions as soon as those restraints have been loosed or done away with. But the situation is altogether different with people who, though asserting that faith alone saves, have nevertheless led 
charitable lives; for their faith has had charity from the Lord within it. </p>

Quia illi qui 'Ham et Canaan' hic vocantur, hoc est, qui fidem separant a charitate, et inde in externis solum ponunt cultum, non scire possunt quid et unde conscientia, paucis dicendum.  Conscientia 
formatur per vera fidei, nam quod homo audivit, agnovit et credidit, hoc conscientiam apud eum facit; dein agere contra illa, ei est agere contra conscientiam, quod satis manifeste constare unicuivis 
potest; inde est, nisi vera fidei sint quae audiat, agnoscat et credat, quod nusquam ei possit esse conscientia vera; nam per vera fidei, operante Domino in charitate, regeneratur homo, ita per illa 
accipit conscientiam, estque conscientia ipse novus homo: inde constat quod vera fidei sint media ut fiat, hoc est, ut vivat homo secundum illa quae fides docet, cujus principale est amare Dominum supra 
omnia et proximum ut semet.  Si non vivat secundum illa, quid fides, nisi inane quid et vox sonans, aut separatum quid a vita caelesti, in quo separato nusquam aliqua salus? nam credere utcumque homo 
vivit, quod usque salvari possit, modo habeat fidem, est dicere, si vel nullam charitatem habeat et si vel nullam conscientiam, quod salvetur, hoc est, si vel in odiis, in vindictis, in rapinis, in 
adulteriis, verbo in omnibus contrariis charitati et conscientiae degat, modo fidem habeat, etiamsi foret in ultima mortis hora, quod salvari possit; expendant nunc, cum in principio tam falso sunt, 
quodnam verum fidei sit, quod formare eorum conscientiam possit; annon, quod falsum? si quid conscientiae se habere putant, sunt modo vincula externa, nempe timor legis, jacturae {1} honoris, lucri, 
famae ob illa, quae faciunt apud eos id quod vocant conscientiam, ne scilicet laedant proximum, utque ei bene faciant; sed quoniam non est conscientia, quia non charitas, ideo tales, vinculis illis remissis 
seu solutis, in scelestissima et obscenissima ruunt. Sed aliter prorsus se habet cum illis qui tametsi dixerunt quod sola fides salvet, et usque vixerunt vitam charitatis; nam in illorum fide charitas 
fuit a Domino. 	@1 I o jacturae, but quoting this [ ] in H.D. 139 S.i. jacturae.$ </p>
