<h3 align="center" class="ired">属天的奥秘 第2276节</h3>
<h4 align="center"></h4><p><strong>2276.</strong>“假若在那里找到三十个呢”表存在某些冲突。这从数字“三十”的含义清楚可知。“三十”表存在某些冲突，因而表少量冲突。其原因在于，这个数字是“五”与“六”相乘的结果，“五”表少许，而“六”表劳碌或争战（即冲突），如第一卷所示（<a href="649.htm">649</a>，<a href="720.htm">720</a>，<a href="737.htm">737</a>，<a href="900.htm">900</a>，<a href="1709.htm">1709</a>节）。<br />因此，人无论在圣言的哪个地方读到这个数字，它都表示相对少许之物。如撒迦利亚书：<br />我对他们说，你们若看为美，就给我工价。不然，就罢了！他们就称了三十锭银子，作为我的工价。耶和华对我说，要把众人给你所估定美好的价值丢给窑户。我便将这三十锭银子，在耶和华的殿中丢给窑户了。（撒迦利亚书<a href="http://39-27.cn/亚11.12.htm">11:12</a>，<a href="http://39-27.cn/亚11.13.htm">13</a>）<br />这表示他们将主的功德，以及来自祂的救赎和救恩估价如此之少。“窑户”表改造和重生。<br />因此，马太福音也提到同样的三十锭银子：<br />他们取了那三十锭银子，就是以色列人给他估定的价钱，给了那银子，去买窑户的田地，照主吩咐我的。（马太福音<a href="http://39-27.cn/太27.9.htm">27:9</a>，<a href="http://39-27.cn/太27.10.htm">10</a>）<br />从这些话很清楚地看出，“三十”在此表给他估定的少量价钱。被认为无甚价值的仆人，值三十舍客勒，这明显可见于摩西五经：<br />牛若触了奴仆或是婢女，必将银子三十舍客勒给他们的主人，牛要用石头打死。（出埃及记<a href="http://39-27.cn/出21.32.htm">21:32</a>）<br />奴仆被估价如此之少，这从同一章（21:20，21）明显看出来。“奴仆”在内义上表劳碌。<br />利未人之所以被呼召来供职—这在民数记（<a href="http://39-27.cn/民4.3.htm">4:3</a>，<a href="http://39-27.cn/民4.23.htm">23</a>，<a href="http://39-27.cn/民4.30.htm">30</a>，<a href="http://39-27.cn/民4.35.htm">35</a>，<a href="http://39-27.cn/民4.39.htm">39</a>，<a href="http://39-27.cn/民4.43.htm">43</a>）中被描述为“从三十岁直到五十岁，凡前来任职在会幕里办事的”，是因为“三十”表那些正在被发起的人，因而表那些尚能执行少许“任职”在属灵之义上所指之事的人。<br />所以，在圣言的其它地方，“三十”也有所提及。如他们要将小公牛并细面十分之三献上（民数记<a href="http://39-27.cn/民15.9.htm">15:9</a>），这是因为小公牛这个祭物代表属世良善，如前所示（<a href="2180.htm">2180</a>节）；属世良善与属灵良善相比只是少许，与属天良善相比则更少。属灵良善由公绵羊这个祭物来代表，而属天良善则由羔羊这个祭物来代表。一同献上的还有以十之几的不同比率所调和的素祭，这明显可见于同一章（15:4-6；以及民数记28:12-13，20-21，28-29；29:3-4，9-10，14-15）。十分之几的比率或比例若不包含天堂的奥秘，绝不会被如此规定。<br />在马可福音中，“三十”也表少许：<br />落到好土里的种子就发生长大，结出果实，有的结三十倍，有的六十倍，有的一百倍。（马可福音<a href="http://39-27.cn/可4.8.htm">4:8</a>）<br />此处“三十”表少量产出，因而表少许劳碌。这些数字若不包含它们所表示的事物，就不会被具体说明。</p>

<p align="center"><b>Potts(1905-1910) 2276</b></p><p><b>2276.</b>
Peradventure thirty shall be found. That this signifies somewhat of combat, is evident from the signification of the number thirty. That "thirty" signifies somewhat of combat, thus but a little of combat, 
comes from the fact that this number is compounded by the multiplication of five (by which is signified some little), and six (by which is signified labor or combat, as was shown in volume 1, n. 
649, 720, 737, 900, 1709). [2] Hence also this number, wherever read in the Word, signifies something that is relatively little; as in Zechariah: </p>
<p>     I said unto them, If it be good in your eyes, 
give me my hire; and if not, forbear; and they weighed my hire, thirty pieces of silver. And Jehovah said unto me, Cast it unto the potter, the goodly price* whereat I was valued by them; and I took the 
thirty silver pieces, and cast it to the potter in the house of Jehovah (Zech. 11:12-13); </p>
<p>denoting that they valued so little the Lord's merit, and redemption and salvation by Him. The "potter" denotes 
reformation and regeneration. [3] Hence the same thirty silver pieces are spoken of in Matthew: </p>
<p>     They took the thirty pieces of silver, the price of Him whom they had bought from the sons 
of Israel, and gave them for the potter's field, as the Lord commanded me (Matt. 27:9-10); </p>
<p>from which it is plainly evident that "thirty" here denotes the price of what is but little valued. The valuation 
of a servant who was held as being of little account, was thirty shekels; as is evident in Moses: </p>
<p>     If the ox gore a manservant, or a maidservant, he shall give unto their master thirty shekels 
of silver; and the ox shall be stoned (Exod. 21:32). Of how little account a servant was held, is evident in the same chapter (verses 20-21). In the internal sense a "servant" denotes labor. [4] 
That the Levites were taken for the work of the ministerial office-which is described by the expression "one coming to exercise warfare, and to do the work in the tent"-from a "son of thirty years to 
one of fifty" (Num. 4:3, 23, 30, 35, 39, 43), was because "thirty" signified those who were being initiated, and who therefore could as yet exercise but little warfare as understood in the spiritual 
sense. [5] So in other passages where "thirty" is named in the Word; as that they should offer "upon a son of an ox a meat-offering of three tenths" (Num. 15:9); which was because the sacrifice of an 
ox represented natural good (as shown above, n. 2180); and natural good is but little in comparison with spiritual good, which was represented by the sacrifice of a ram; and still less in comparison 
with celestial good, which was represented by the sacrifice of a lamb; in connection with which there was another rate of tenths for the meat-offering, as is evident in the same chapter (verses 4 to 6; 
also Num. 28:12-13, 20-21, 28-29; 29:3-4, 9-10, 14-15); which rates of tenths, or which proportions, would never have been commanded, unless they had involved heavenly arcana. In Mark also "thirty" 
denotes a little: </p>
<p>     The seed which fell into good ground yielded fruit growing up and increasing, and brought forth, one thirty, and another sixty, and another a hundred (Mark 4:8), where "thirty" 
denotes a small growth, and that which has labored but little. These numbers would not have been marked out for use, unless they had contained within them the things which they signify. * Literally, 
"the magnificence of the price." [Reviser.] </p>

<p align="center"><b>Elliott(1983-1999) 2276</b></p><p><b>2276.</b>
'Perhaps thirty will be found [there]' means some existence of conflict. This is clear from the meaning of the number 'thirty'. The reason 'thirty' means some existence of conflict, thus a small amount 
of conflict, is that this number is the product of 'five', meaning that which is small, times 'six', meaning toil or conflict, as shown in Volume One, in <a href="649.htm">649</a>, <a href="720.htm">720</a>, <a href="737.htm">737</a>, <a href="900.htm">900</a>, <a href="1709.htm">1709</a>. </p>
<p></p>
<p><b>[2]</b>
 Hence also 
that number, wherever one reads it in the Word, means something relatively small, as in Zechariah,  </p>
<blockquote>
I said to them, If it is good in your eyes, give me my wages; and if not, withhold them. And they 
weighed out my wages, thirty pieces of silver. And Jehovah said to me, Throw it to the potter, the magnificent price I was valued at among them. And I took the thirty pieces of silver and threw it into 
the house of Jehovah, to the potter. <a href="http://bible.gospelcom.net/cgi-bin/bible?passage=Zech%2011:%2012,%2013&amp;version=ESV&amp;interface=print&amp;showfn=yes&amp;showxref">Zech 11: 12, 13</a>. 
</blockquote>
<p>This stands for how small a value those people placed on the Lord's merit, and on redemption and salvation from Him. 'The poster' stands for 
reformation and regeneration. </p>
<p></p>
<p><b>[3]</b>
 This explains the reference to the same thirty pieces of silver in Matthew, </p>
<blockquote>
They took the thirty pieces of silver, the price set on him whom they had bought 
from the children of Israel, and gave them for the potter's field, as the Lord commanded me. <a href="http://bible.gospelcom.net/cgi-bin/bible?passage=Matt%2027:%209,%2010&amp;version=ESV&amp;interface=print&amp;showfn=yes&amp;showxref">Matt 27: 9, 10</a>. 
</blockquote>
<p>From these words it is quite clear that 'thirty' here stands for the small price set on 
him. A slave, who was not considered to be worth much, was valued at thirty shekels, as is clear in Moses, </p>
<blockquote>
If the ox gores a slave or a servant-girl, the owner shall give to his master thirty shekels 
of silver; and the ox shall be stoned. <a href="http://bible.gospelcom.net/cgi-bin/bible?passage=Exod%2021:%2032&amp;version=ESV&amp;interface=print&amp;showfn=yes&amp;showxref">Exod 21: 32</a>. 
</blockquote>
<p>How little a slave was considered to be worth is clear from verses 20, 21, of that same chapter. In the internal sense 'a slave' stands for 
toil. </p>
<p></p>
<p><b>[4]</b>
 The reason Levites were called upon for ministerial duty - which is described as one 'coming to perform military service and to do the work in the tent [of meeting] - from thirty up to fifty 
years of age', <a href="http://bible.gospelcom.net/cgi-bin/bible?passage=Num%204:%203,%2023,%2030,%2035,%2039,%2043&amp;version=ESV&amp;interface=print&amp;showfn=yes&amp;showxref">Num 4: 3, 23, 30, 35, 39, 43</a>, was that 'thirty' means those who were beginners, thus those who as yet could perform little of what was meant in the spiritual sense by 'military service'. </p>
<p></p>
<p><b>[5]</b>
There are other places in the Word besides these where 'thirty' is mentioned, such as in the requirement that with a young bull a minchah of three tenths [of fine flour] was to be offered 
by them, <a href="http://bible.gospelcom.net/cgi-bin/bible?passage=Num%2015:%209&amp;version=ESV&amp;interface=print&amp;showfn=yes&amp;showxref">Num 15: 9</a>. Such was required because the sacrifice of an ox represented natural good, as shown above in <a href="2180.htm">2180</a>, and natural good is small in comparison with spiritual good, which was represented 
by the sacrifice of a ram, and smaller still in comparison with celestial good, which was represented by the sacrifice of a lamb, with which sacrifices a different number of tenths to the minchah 
were required, as is clear in verses 4-6 of that chapter, and also in <a href="http://bible.gospelcom.net/cgi-bin/bible?passage=Num%2028:%2012,13,%2020,%2021,%2028,%2029;%2029:%203,%204,%209,%2010,%2014,%2015&amp;version=ESV&amp;interface=print&amp;showfn=yes&amp;showxref">Num 28: 12,13, 20, 21, 28, 29; 29: 3, 4, 9, 10, 14, 15</a>. These differing numbers of tenths, or proportions, would never have been 
commanded if they had not embodied heavenly arcana within them. </p>
<p></p>
<p><b>[6]</b>
 'Thirty' again stands for that which is small in Mark, </p>
<blockquote>
The seed which fell into good ground yielded fruit, growing up and increasing. 
One bore thirty-fold, and another sixty, and another a hundred. <a href="http://bible.gospelcom.net/cgi-bin/bible?passage=Mark%204:-8&amp;version=ESV&amp;interface=print&amp;showfn=yes&amp;showxref">Mark 4:-8</a>. 
</blockquote>
<p>'Thirty' stands for a small yield and for that which has laboured to only a small extent. Those numbers would not 
have been specified unless they had embodied the things meant by them. </p>

<p align="center"><b>Latin(1748-1756) 2276</b>
</p><b>2276.</b>
`Forte inventi fuerint triginta': quod significet aliquid pugnae, constat ex significatione numeri triginta: quod `triginta' significent aliquid pugnae, ita parum pugnae, est inde quia numerus ille 
per multiplicationem compositus est ex `quinque,' quibus significatur aliquid parum, et ex `sex,' quibus significatur labor seu pugna, ut in Parte Prima n. 649, 720, 737, 900, 1709 ostensum est: [2] inde 
etiam numerus ille, ubicumque in Verbo legitur, significat aliquid parum respective, sicut apud Zachariam, 	Dixi ad illos, Si bonum in oculis vestris, date mercedem [meam,] et si non, omittite; et 
appenderunt mercedem meam, triginta argenteos; et dixit Jehovah ad me, Projice illud ad figulum, magnificentiam pretii, qua aestimatus sum ab apud (c)eos; et sumpsi triginta argenteos, et projeci illud 
in domum Jehovae ad figulum, xi 12, 13; </p>
<p>pro quod tam parum aestimaverant meritum Domini, (c)ac redemptionem (c)et salvationem ab Ipso; `figulus' pro reformatione et regeneratione: [3] inde de iisdem 
triginta argenteis {1} apud Matthaeum, 	Sumpserunt triginta argenteos [pretium aestimati], quem emerant a filiis Israelis, et dederunt pro agro figuli, sicut praecepit mihi Dominus, xxvii [9,] 10; </p>
<p>ex 
quibus manifeste constat, quod `triginta' ibi pro pretio aestimati parvo: {2} aestimatio servi {3} qui pro vili habebatur, erat triginta siclorum, ut constat apud Mosen, 	Si servum ferierit bos, 
aut ancillam, argentum triginta siclorum dabit domino ejus, et bos lapidabitur, Exod. xxi 32; </p>
<p>quam vilis habebatur servus, constat ibi vers. 20, 21; `servus' in sensu interno pro labore. 	[4] Quod 
Levitae assumerentur ad obeundum ministerium, quod describitur per venientem ad exercendum militiam, et faciendum opus in tentorio, a filio triginta annorum ad quinquaginta, Num. iv 3, 23, 30, 35, 39, 
43, erat quia per `triginta' significabantur qui initiarentur, ita qui parum adhuc exercere militiam in spirituali sensu intellectum possent; [5] praeter alibi, ubi `triginta' in Verbo nominantur; 
	 	Sicut quod offerrent super filium bovis minham tres decimas, Num. xv 9, quod erat (x)quia sacrificium de bove repraesentabat bonum naturale, ut supra n. 2180 ostensum, et bonum naturale parum est 
respective ad bonum spirituale, quod repraesentabatur per sacrificium arietis, et adhuc minus respective ad bonum caeleste, quod repraesentabatur per sacrificium agni, circa quae alia ratio decimarum 
minhae fuit, ut constat ibi vers. 4-6; tum Num. xxviii 12, 13, 20, 21, 28, 29; xxix 3, 4, 9, 10, 14, 15; quae rationes decimarum seu proportiones nusquam mandatae fuissent nisi involvissent arcana caelestia. 
 {4}`Triginta' pro parvo etiam apud Marcum, 	Semen, quod cecidit in terram bonam, dedit fructum ascendentem, et crescentem, et tulit unum triginta, et alterum sexaginta, et alterum centum, iv 
8; </p>
