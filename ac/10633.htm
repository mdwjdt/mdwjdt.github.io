<h3 align="center" class="ired">属天的奥秘 第10633节</h3>
<h4 align="center"></h4><p><strong>10633</strong>.“我要在你众百姓面前行奇事”表一部圣言，为教会提供，神性在其中每一个部分里面。这从“摩西的百姓”和“奇事”的含义清楚可知：“摩西的百姓”是指教会所在的地方，因为教会要建立在他们当中；耶和华将要做的“奇事”是指存在于圣言的每一个部分中的神性事物。因为圣言对这方面是一个奇迹，即：它在一点一划上都是神性。那里的每一个词都对应于某种属灵事物，这属灵事物可以说就隐藏它里面，因为当世人阅读圣言时，它的属灵内涵就在天使面前变得显而易见。此处的情况是这样：存在于自然界中的一切事物，无一例外，都与存在于灵界中的事物有一种对应关系，这包括一切词语。此外，圣言是以这种方式写成的：它里面在句子中接连出现的词语体现了一系列属灵事物，这些属灵事物只向那些熟悉对应关系的人显现。神性之物便以这种方式隐藏在圣言中；圣言由此而变得属灵，甚至它也被称为属灵的。因此，这就是此处“奇事”所表示的，因为所论述的主题是要在这个人民当中写成的圣言。</p>

Before all thy people I will do wonderful things. That this signifies the Word, in that it is Divine in each and all things for the sake of the church, is evident from the signification of the "people 
of Moses," as being where the church is, because the church was to be instituted among them; and from the signification of the "wonderful things" that Jehovah was about to do, as being the Divine things 
in each and all things of the Word. For the Word is wonderful in this respect, that it is Divine as to every jot, for every word corresponds to some spiritual thing which may be said to be stored 
up within it, because the spiritual of the Word is made manifest with the angels, when the Word is read by man. The case herein is this. Each and all things in the natural world have a correspondence 
with those which are in the spiritual world, and this down to every word. And the Word has been so written that its words in their series involve series of spiritual things, which do not appear to a 
man unless he is acquainted with correspondences. In this way what is Divine lies hidden in the Word. From this the Word is spiritual, as also it is called. This therefore is what is here meant by a "wonderful 
thing," because the subject treated of is the Word which was to be written among that people. </p>

'Before all your people I will do marvels' means a Word, Divine in every single part, provided for the Church. This is clear from the meaning of Moses' 'people' as where the Church exists, for the Church 
was to be established among them; and from the meaning of 'marvels', which Jehovah is about to do, as Divine things present in every single part of the Word. For the Word is a marvel, in that it 
is Divine as to every jot or iota. Each word there corresponds to something spiritual which may be said to lie concealed within it, since its spiritual content is revealed to angels when the Word is read 
by someone in the world. For the situation is this: All things without exception that exist in the natural world have a correspondence with those which exist in the spiritual world; and this includes 
all words. Furthermore the Word has been written in such a way that the words in it, following one another in sentences, embody series of spiritual things, which are apparent to none except those 
who are acquainted with correspondences. This is where the Divine element lies in the Word; and this in turn is what makes the Word spiritual, even as it is called such. This then is what should be understood 
here by a marvel, for the Word which was to be written among that people is the subject.  </p>

`Coram omni populo tuo faciam mirabilia':  quod significet Verbum quod Divinum in omnibus et singulis pro Ecclesia, constat ex significatione `populi Moschis' quod sit ubi Ecclesia, quoniam apud illum 
institueretur Ecclesia, et ex significatione `mirabilium quae Jehovah facturus' quod sint Divina in omnibus et singulis Verbi; Verbum enim in eo est mirabile, quod Divinum sit quoad omnem iotam,  {1}nam 
unaquaevis vox correspondet rei alicui spirituali, quod dici potest reconditum in illa, quia spirituale ejus propalatur apud angelos cum Verbum legitur ab homine; cum hoc ita se habet:  (m){2} omnia 
et singula quae in naturali mundo sunt correspondentiam habent cum illis quae in spirituali mundo sunt, et hoc usque ad singulas voces; et Verbum ita conscriptum est ut voces ibi in sua serie involvant 
series rerum spiritualium, quae non apparent homini nisi qui correspondentias novit; in hoc latet Divinum in Verbo; exinde est Verum spirituale, sicut etiam vocatur;(n) hoc itaque est quod hic 
per mirabile intelligitur, quoniam agitur de Verbo, quod apud illum populum {3}conscribendum erat. @1 nam unaquaevis vox in se continet Divinum spirituale et coeleste, quod reconditum in illa est, et 
propalatur apud angelos$ @2 i nam$ @3 d conscribendum i concinnandum$ </p>
