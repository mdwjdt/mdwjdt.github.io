<h4 align="center"></h4><p><strong>10756</strong>.他们接着说，他们能察觉属赤身族类的人是否有构成真正婚姻的东西在里面；结果表明，他们是从关于婚姻的属灵观念中察觉到这一点的。这种观念被传给我，发现是这样：两个人里面的内层事物的相似性是由真理与良善、因而信与仁的结合而产生的；婚姻之爱从这种结合出来降至身体。因为属于心智的一切都以某种属世的形式表现在身体中。因此，当两个人在一个内在层面上彼此相爱，各自也出于这爱渴望如对方那样意愿和思考，从而在属于心智的内层事物的层面上与对方在一起并结合时，它就表现为婚姻之爱的形式。其心智的属灵情感由此在身体中变成属世情感，并给自己披上婚姻之爱的感觉。他们还说，一个男人和数个妻子之间不存在具有婚姻性质的任何东西。</p>

They said further that they have a perception whether those of their race who are naked have in them the conjugial principle; and it was shown that they perceive this from a spiritual idea about marriage, 
which being communicated to me was found to be that a likeness of the interiors was formed by the conjunction of truth and good, thus of faith and love, and that conjugial love comes forth from 
this conjunction coming down into the body. For all things of the lower mind [animus] are set forth in the body in some natural form, thus in the form of conjugial love when the interiors of two mutually 
love each other, and also from this love long to will and to think the one as the other, thus to be together and to be conjoined in respect to the interiors of the mind. From this the spiritual affection 
of their minds becomes natural in the body, and clothes itself with the feeling of conjugial love. They also said that there is nothing whatever of a conjugial nature between one man and a number 
of wives. </p>

They went on to say that they can perceive whether anything constituting real marriage exists among those of their nation who are naked; and it was demonstrated that they perceive it from a spiritual 
idea regarding marriage. That idea, which was conveyed to me, was one in which a likeness of the interior things [in two people] is produced by the joining together of truth and good, thus of faith and 
charity; and from that joining together as it descends into the body conjugial love springs. For everything belonging to the mind is manifested in some natural form in the body. Thus it is manifested 
in the form of conjugial love when two people love each other on an interior level and when each is also filled by that love with the desire to will and think as the other does, and so to be together 
with and joined to the other on the level of interior things belonging to the mind. Consequently spiritual affection belonging to their minds becomes natural affection in the body, clothing itself 
in the feelings that accompany conjugial love. They also said that nothing whatever of real marriage exists where one man has a number of wives.  </p>

Dicebant porro quod perceptionem habeant num conjugiale sit apud illos ex sua gente qui nudi sunt; et ostendebatur {1} quod id percipiant ex idea spirituali de conjugio, quae mecum communicata erat 
talis ut similitudo interiorum esset formata per conjunctionem veri et boni, ita fidei et amoris, et quod ex illa conjunctione descendente in corpus existat amor conjugialis; nam omnia quae animi sunt 
sistuntur in aliqua specie naturali in corpore, ita in specie amoris conjugialis, cum interiora duorum se mutuo amant, et quoque ex amore illo desiderant velle et cogitare unus sicut alter, ita quoad 
interiora quae mentis, simul esse et conjungi; inde affectio spiritualis, quae mentium, fit naturalis in corpore {2}ac induit se sensu amoris conjugialis.  Dicebant etiam quod prorsus non conjugiale 
detur inter unum virum et plures uxores. @1 i tunc$ @2 ubi$ </p>
