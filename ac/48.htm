<h3 align="center" class="ired">属天的奥秘 第48节</h3>
<h4 align="center"></h4><p><strong>48.</strong>由此可见，当人的言语表现出信（关乎觉性），对真理和良善更为坚定，他是到了第五个阶段。此时，人的言行举止开始有了生气，被称为“水中的鱼”、“空中的鸟”。当人本着信（关乎觉性）与爱（关乎意志），言说真理，奉行良善，则到了第六个阶段。至此，人的言行举止被称为“活物”或“牲畜”，因为他不仅持信而行，也奉爱而行，成了属灵之人，被称为“神的形像”，正是下一节所要论述的。</p>

<p><strong>[NCE]48.</strong> All this verifies the premise: In the fifth stage we speak with conviction (an attribute of the intellect) and in the process strengthen ourselves in truth and goodness. The things we then produce have life in them and are called the fish of the sea and the birds in the heavens. And in the sixth stage we act with conviction (an attribute of the intellect) and therefore with love (an attribute of the will) in speaking truth and doing good. What we then produce is called a living soul, an animal. Because this is the point at which we begin to act as much with love as with conviction, we become spiritual people, who are called [God's] image — the very next subject. </p>
<p align="center"><b>Potts(1905-1910) 48</b></p><p><b>48.</b>
Hence then it appears that man is in the fifth state of regeneration when he speaks from a principle of faith, which belongs to the understanding, and thereby confirms himself in the true and in the 
good. The things then brought forth by him are animate, and are called the "fishes of the sea" and the "fowl of the heavens." He is in the sixth state, when from faith, which is of the understanding, 
and from love thence derived, which is of the will, he speaks truths, and does goods; what he then brings forth being called the "living soul" and the "beast." And as he then begins to act from love, 
as well as from faith, he becomes a spiritual man, who is called an "image of God" which is the subject now treated of. </p>

<p align="center"><b>Elliott(1983-1999) 48</b></p><p><b>48.</b>
From these considerations it is now clear that the fifth state is one in which a person speaks from faith which is part of the understanding and in so doing confirms himself in truth and good; and that 
what he produces at that point are the animate things called 'the fish of the sea and the birds of the air.<A name="fntext1"></a><A href="#fn1"><sup>a</sup></a> It is also clear that the sixth state exists when he utters truths and performs good deeds 
from faith which is part of the understanding and so from love which is part of the will. What he produces at that point is called a living creature and a beast. And because at that point he begins 
to act both from faith and from love simultaneously, he becomes a spiritual man, who is called an image; and this is dealt with next.

</p><b>48.</b>
Ex his nunc constat quod quintus status sit, quod homo ex fide quae est intellectus, loquatur, seque inde confirmet in vero et bono, et quae tunc producit, sint animata, quae vocantur 'pisces maris 
et aves caelorum.' Et quod sextus status sit, cum ex fide quae est intellectus, et inde ex amore qui est voluntatis, vera loquatur et bono faciat; quae tunc producit, vocantur 'anima vivens et bestia.' 
Et quia tunc incipit simul ac ex fide, etiam ex amore agere, fit homo spiritualis qui vocatur 'imago,' de qua nunc.
