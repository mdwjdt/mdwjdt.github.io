<h4 align="center"></h4><p><strong>97.</strong>以“吹气”和“气息”来描述生命，也因为上古教会之人可通过呼吸的状态来觉察爱与信的状态。这呼吸的状态在后来的世代逐渐发生了变化。在此我无法对它进行描述，因为今时之人对它一无所知。但上古之人并灵界之人对它十分了解，这是他们将灵魂或生命比作“风”的原因。<br />主在谈论人的重生时，也将灵魂比作“风”：“风随着意思吹，你听见风的响声，却不晓得从那里来，往那里去。凡从圣灵生的，也是如此。”（约翰福音<a href="http://39-27.cn/约3.8.htm">3:8</a>）又如经上记着说：“诸天藉耶和华的命而造，万象藉他口中的气而成。”（诗篇<a href="http://39-27.cn/诗33.6.htm">33:6</a>）再如：“你收回它们的气，它们就死亡，归于尘土。你发出你的灵，它们便受造。你使地面更换为新。”（诗篇<a href="http://39-27.cn/诗104.29.htm">104:29</a>-<a href="http://39-27.cn/诗104.30.htm">30</a>）<br />对于“气”被用来指信与爱的活力，这从以下经文可知：“在人里面有灵，全能者的气使他有聪明。”（约伯记<a href="http://39-27.cn/伯32.8.htm">32:8</a>）又如：“神的灵造我，全能者的气使我得生。”（约伯记<a href="http://39-27.cn/伯33.4.htm">33:4</a>）</p>

<p><strong>[NCE]97.</strong> The nature of the earliest church provides yet another reason for the use of breathing and breath as depictions of a life force. The people of that church could perceive the quality of love and faith in others from the quality of their breathing — a quality that gradually changed over the generations. Nothing can be said about this kind of respiration any longer, since time has buried any knowledge of it.{*1} The earliest people knew all about it, and people in the next life do too, but no one left on the globe today does.<br />In consequence, people of the earliest church used wind as a metaphor for spirit or life. So does the Lord when he speaks of our regeneration in John:<br />The spirit [wind]{*2} blows where it wishes, and you hear its voice but do not know where it may be coming from or where it may be going; this is the way with everyone who is born from the spirit. (<a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_97/bible_king-james-version_john_3_8" target=_top>John 3:8</a>)<br />David has something similar:<br />By Jehovah's word were the heavens made, and by the spirit [wind] of his mouth, the whole army of them. (<a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_97/bible_king-james-version_psalms_33_6" target=_top>Psalms 33:6</a>)<br />And again:<br />You gather their spirit, they pass away and return to their dust; you send your spirit out, they continue to be created, and you renew the face of the ground. (<a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_97/bible_king-james-version_psalms_104_29-30" target=_top>Psalms 104:29-30</a>)<br />It can be seen in Job that breath stands for the vital quality of faith and love:<br />There is a spirit in humankind, and the breath of Shaddai{*3} makes them understand. (<a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_97/bible_king-james-version_job_32_8" target=_top>Job 32:8</a>)<br />Again:<br />The spirit of God made me, and the breath of Shaddai gave me life. (<a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_97/bible_king-james-version_job_33_4" target=_top>Job 33:4</a>)<br /><br /><strong>Footnotes:</strong><br />{*1} Swedenborg himself experienced changes in respiration that he associated with altered states of consciousness. He remarks that even as a child he had been accustomed to exercise what he called "inner respiration" while praying (Spiritual Experiences [Swedenborg 1998-2002] <a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_97/swedenborg_spiritual-experiences-odhner_3320" target=_top>3320</a>, <a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_97/swedenborg_spiritual-experiences-odhner_3464" target=_top>3464</a>). When as a mature man he wrote in a state of inspiration, he found his breath would almost stop (Spiritual Experiences [Swedenborg 1998-2002] <a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_97/swedenborg_spiritual-experiences-odhner_3320" target=_top>3320</a>). [RS]<br />{*2} The parenthetical interpolations of the word "wind" here and in the quotation from <a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_97/bible_king-james-version_psalms_33_6" target=_top>Psalms 33:6</a> below are Swedenborg's. [LHC]<br />{*3} Shaddai (שַׁדַּי [šaddai]) is a name for God, already archaic by the time the Hebrew Scriptures were written. The etymology and meaning are unknown, but it is often translated as "Almighty." Recent scholarship suggests that it comes from a Semitic root meaning "mountain;" thus Shaddai may mean "the mountain [god]" (Cross 1973, 52-55). Swedenborg discusses the name at length in <a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_97/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_1992" target=_top>1992</a>.

The reason why life is described by "breathing" and by "breath" is also that the men of the Most Ancient Church perceived states of love and of faith by states of respiration, which were successively 
changed in their posterity. Of this respiration nothing can as yet be said, because at this day such things are altogether unknown. The most ancient people were well acquainted with it, and so are those 
who are in the other life, but no longer anyone on this earth, and this was the reason why they likened spirit or life to "wind." The Lord also does this when speaking of the regeneration of man, 
in John:*      The wind bloweth where it listeth, and thou hearest the voice thereof, and knowest not whence it cometh, or whither it goeth so is everyone that is born of the spirit (John 3:8). So in 
David: </p>
<p>     By the word of Jehovah were the heavens made, and all the army of them by the breath of His mouth (Ps. 33:6). And again: </p>
<p>     Thou gatherest their breath, they expire, and return to their 
dust; Thou sendest forth Thy spirit, they are created, and Thou renewest the faces of the ground (Ps. 104:29-30).That the "breath" [spiraculum] is used for the life of faith and of love, appears 
from Job: </p>
<p>     He is the spirit in man, and the breath of Shaddai giveth them understanding (Job 32:8). Again in the same: </p>
<p>     The Spirit of God hath made me, and the breath of Shaddai hath given 
me life (Job 33:4). * In the original languages, "wind" "spirit" and "breath" are all expressed by the same word. [Reviser.] </p>

<p align="center"><b>Elliott(1983-1999) 97</b></p><p><b>97.</b>
A further reason why life is described as breathing and breath is that members of the Most Ancient Church perceived states of love and faith by means of states of breathing, which states changed step 
by step in their descendants. To say anything as yet about that type of breathing is not possible since it is completely hidden from men at the present day. The most ancient people were well acquainted 
with it, and so are people in the next life; but nobody on earth up to now has been acquainted with it. This is why people used to liken the spirit or life to the wind, including the Lord when talking 
about man's regeneration, in John,  </p>
<blockquote>
The spirit (or wind) blows where it wills, and you hear the sound of it, but you do not know whence it comes or whither it goes; so it is with everyone who has 
been begotten of the spirit. <a href="http://bible.gospelcom.net/cgi-bin/bible?passage=John%203:8&amp;version=ESV&amp;interface=print&amp;showfn=yes&amp;showxref">John 3:8</a>. 
</blockquote>
<p>Similarly in David,  </p>
<blockquote>
By the word of Jehovah were the heavens made, and all their host by the spirit (or wind) of His mouth. <a href="http://bible.gospelcom.net/cgi-bin/bible?passage=Ps%2033:6&amp;version=ESV&amp;interface=print&amp;showfn=yes&amp;showxref">Ps 33:6</a>.   
</blockquote>
And in the same 
author,   You gatherest up their spirit, they breathe their last and return to their dust. You send forth Your spirit, they are created, and You renewest the face<A name="fntext1"></a><A href="#fn1"><sup>a</sup></a> of the ground. <a href="http://bible.gospelcom.net/cgi-bin/bible?passage=Ps%20104:29,%2030&amp;version=ESV&amp;interface=print&amp;showfn=yes&amp;showxref">Ps 104:29, 30</a>.  </p>
<p>That 
'breath' stands for the life inherent in faith and love is clear in Job, </p>
<blockquote>
It is the spirit in a man, and the breath of Shaddai<A name="fntext2"></a><A href="#fn2"><sup>b</sup></a> makes them understand. <a href="http://bible.gospelcom.net/cgi-bin/bible?passage=Job%2032:8&amp;version=ESV&amp;interface=print&amp;showfn=yes&amp;showxref">Job 32:8</a>.

Quod vita per inspirationem et per spiraculum describatur, est quoque causa quod Antiquissimae Ecclesiae homines perceperint status amoris et fidei per status respirationis, qui status mutati sunt successive 
in posteris eorum; de qua respiratione nondum aliquid dici potest quia hodie prorsus abdita sunt; antiquissimi hoc bene norunt, et qui in altera vita norunt; sed in terrarum hoc orbe nullus 
adhuc: inde spiritum seu vitam assimilabant vento; etiam Dominus, cum de regeneratione hominis loquitur, apud Johannem, 	Spiritus, (seu ventus,) {1} ubi vult, spirat; et vocem ejus audis, atque non scis, 
unde veniat, aut quo abeat; sic est omnis, qui generatus a spiritu, iii 8: </p>
<p>apud Davidem similiter, 	Per Verbum Jehovae caeli facti sunt, et per spiritum, (seu ventum) {2} oris Ipsius, omnis exercitus 
illorum, Ps. xxxiii 6: </p>
<p>et apud eundem, 	Colligis spiritum eorum, exspirant et ad pulverem suum revertuntur; emittis spiritum Tuum, creantur, et renovas facies humi, Ps. civ 29, 30. Quod 'spiraculum' 
pro vita fidei et amoris accipiatur, constat apud Jobum, 	Spiritus ille in homine, et spiraculum Shaddai {3} intelligere facit eos, xxxii 8: </p>
<p>tum apud eundem, 	Spiritus Dei fecit me, et spiraculum 
Shaddai vivificavit me, xxxiii 4. @	1 Parentheses inserted as in n. 8286$ @	2 Parentheses inserted as in n. 8286.$ @	3 See n. 1992 for a full explanation of this term, which Sch. usually translates
