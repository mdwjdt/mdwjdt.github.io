<h4 align="center"></h4><p><strong>7250.</strong>由于具有这种性质，当进入来世时，他们会受到邪恶与虚假很大的侵扰。他们的地狱看似在这个星球周围，与我们地球上恶人的地狱没有任何联系，因为他们具有完全不同的性质和性情；因此，他们的邪恶与虚假也属于完全不同的类型。不过，那些能得救的人住在消磨的地方，在那里陷入彻底的深渊。因为这种性质的邪恶与虚假无法以其它任何方式被除去。当陷入绝望状态时，他们喊着说，他们是野兽，是残忍、可憎、充满仇恨的，因而受到诅咒。当处于这种状态时，他们当中一些人也会对着天堂叫嚷；不过，他们是值得原谅的，因为他们是在绝望中如此行的。主会进行缓和，免得他们超出某些限度而破口大骂。当这些人最后的苦难结束后，他们最终得救，因为现在他们的肉体情欲可以说死去了。</p>

Being of this character, when they come into the other life they are very much infested by falsities and evils. Their hells appear around that earth, and do not communicate with the hells of the evil 
of our earth, because they are of a wholly different genius and disposition; hence also their evils and falsities are of quite another kind. But they who are such that they can be saved are in places 
of vastation, and are there reduced to the extremity of despair; for evils and falsities of that kind cannot be removed in any other way. When they are in a state of despair, they cry out that they are 
beasts, brutes, abominations, hatreds, and thus that they are damned. Some of them when in such a state cry out also against heaven, but for this they are excused, because it is from despair. The Lord 
moderates it, lest they should break out into reproaches beyond certain fixed limits. When they have suffered to the utmost, as their bodily things are then as it were dead, they are at last saved. </p>

Since they are like this they too, when they enter the next life, are molested very greatly by falsities and evils. The hells which appear to them surrounding their planet have no contact with the hells 
of the wicked belonging to our planet, because they are entirely different in nature and disposition, as a consequence of which their evils and falsities also are of an altogether different kind. 
But those who are such that they are able to be saved are in places where vastation takes place, and there they are driven to the depths of despair. For evils and falsities of that nature cannot be removed 
in any other way. While in the state of despair they cry out, saying that they are beastly animals, brutish ones, abominable creatures, filled with hatred, and so are damned. Some of them passing 
through this kind of state also cry out against heaven; but they are forgiven because they do this in their despair. The Lord prevents them from going beyond certain limits when they launch into vituperation. 
When these people's last sufferings are over, they are finally saved, because now their bodily passions are so to speak dead. </p>

Quia tales sunt, etiam cum in alteram vitam veniunt, infestantur ibi quam maxime a falsis et malis; inferna quae illis apparent circa tellurem illam, nec communicant cum infernis malorum nostrae telluris, 
ex causa quia prorsus alio genio et alia indole sunt, inde quoque mala et falsa illorum sunt ex prorsus alio genere.  Qui (x)autem tales sunt ut salvari possint, sunt {1} in locis vastationis, 
ac ibi ad ultimum desperationis rediguntur; nam illius generis mala et falsa non aliter possunt removeri; {2} cum in statu desperationis sunt, clamant quod bestiae sint, quod bruta, quod abominationes, 
quod odia, et sic quod damnati; quidam eorum {3} cum in tali statu sunt, etiam contra caelum clamant; sed hoc illis ignoscitur quia ex desperatione; Dominus moderatur ne in (x)vituperia se effundant 
nisi ad certos limites; hi cum extrema passi sunt, quia corporea tunc apud illos quasi mortua sunt, demum salvantur. 	@1 i ibi$ 	@2 i et$ 	@3 i etiam$ </p>
