<h3 align="center" class="ired">属天的奥秘 第2665节</h3>
<h4 align="center"></h4><p><strong>2665.</strong>“凡撒拉对你说的话，你都该听从她的声音”表祂应照属灵真理行事。这从撒拉的代表物和“听从声音”的含义清楚可知：撒拉是指神性属灵之物，或神性真理（参看<a href="2622.htm">2622</a>节）；“听从声音”是指照着这真理行事（参看<a href="2542.htm">2542</a>节）。不过，至于何谓照着属灵真理行事，将这一点明明白白地解释出来，不如让那些通晓内义的人去直觉来得容易。因此，如果我们非要照着他们的直觉阐述它的意思，那么这种阐述几乎得不到认可。还有一个原因是，更多的奥秘首先要被公开，事实上，要在这个问题逐渐明朗，然后能进入构成人们信仰的观念之前被相信。一般来说，它所表示的意思可在某种程度上被描述出来，也就是说，主通过这神圣人性得出一个结论，并照着这个结论行事，因而靠的是祂自己的力量。因为祂正是凭借神性真理将人性融合到神性上，凭借良善将神性融合到人性上。关于这种相互融合，可参看2004节。</p>

All that Sarah saith unto thee, hearken unto her voice. That this signifies that He should act according to spiritual truth, is evident from the representation of Sarah, as being the Divine spiritual, 
or Divine truth (see n. 2622); and from the signification of "hearkening to the voice," as being to act according to it (see n. 2542). What it is to act according to spiritual truth cannot be unfolded 
to the apprehension in the fullness in which it can be perceived by those who are in the internal sense; and therefore if we were to state what it is according to their perception, it would scarcely 
be acknowledged; and there is the further reason that more arcana are first to be unfolded, nay, believed, before the matter when unfolded can enter into the ideas of men's belief. What it signifies 
in a general way can be told in some small degree, namely, that the Lord formed a conclusion from the Human Divine, and acted according to it, and thus from His own power: for Divine truth was that by 
means of which He united the Human to the Divine; and Divine good that by means of which He united the Divine to the Human; which unition was reciprocal (see n. 2004). </p>

<p align="center"><b>Elliott(1983-1999) 2665</b></p><p><b>2665.</b>
'Everything which Sarah says to you, hearken to her voice' means that He was to act in accordance with spiritual truth. This is clear from the representation of 'Sarah' as the Divine spiritual or Divine 
Truth, dealt with in <a href="2622.htm">2622</a>, and from the meaning of 'hearkening to the voice' as acting in accordance with that Truth, dealt with in <a href="2542.htm">2542</a>. But as to what is meant by acting in accordance with spiritual 
truth, an intelligible explanation of this to others is less easy than the perception of it by those who know the internal sense. Consequently any statement made according to the way in which the 
latter perceive what is meant could hardly be recognized. And there is the further reason that more arcana have first to be brought out into the open and indeed to be believed before the matter can be 
explained and then enter into the ideas that constitute his belief. What it means in a general way can be described to some extent, namely that the Lord arrived at a conclusion from the Divine Human, 
and acted according to it, and so from His own power. For it was by means of Divine Truth that He united the Human to the Divine, and by means of Divine Good that He united the Divine to the Human. 
Regarding this reciprocal union, see <a href="2004.htm">2004</a>. </p>

</p><b>2665.</b>
Quod `omne quod dicit ad te Sarah, audi voci ejus' significet quod secundum spirituale verum ageret, constat ex repraesentatione `Sarae' quod sit Divinum spirituale seu Divinum Verum, de qua n. 2622, 
et ex significatione `audire voci' quod sit secundum id agere, de qua n. 2542. Quid sit agere secundum spirituale verum, non ad captum ita explicari potest sicut potest percipi ab illis qui in sensu 
interno sunt, quare si secundum perceptionem horum diceretur quid sit, vix agnosceretur; ex causa etiam quia plura arcana prius evolvenda, immo credenda, antequam res explicata in ideas fidei intrare 
possit; quid in communi significet, aliquantisper dici potest, nempe quod sit quod Dominus ex Humano Divino concluderet, et secundum id ageret, ita ex propria potentia; Divinum (t)enim Verum fuit per 
quod univit Humanum Divino, ac Divinum Bonum per quod univit Divinum Humano; quod reciproca unitio fuerit, videatur n. 2004. </p>
