<h3 align="center" class="ired">属天的奥秘 第4482节</h3>
<h4 align="center"></h4><p><strong>4482.</strong>“看哪，这地在他们面前也宽阔”表延伸，也就是说，教义真理的延伸。这从“地”和“宽阔”的含义清楚可知：“地”是指教会（参看<a href="4480.htm">4480</a>节）；“宽阔”是指真理上，因而教义事物上的延伸。尺寸方面的描述在内义并非表示尺寸，而表示状态的品质；因为尺寸涉及空间，而来世并没有空间或时间，只有与其相对应的状态（参看<a href="2625.htm">2625</a>，<a href="2837.htm">2837</a>，<a href="3356.htm">3356</a>，<a href="3387.htm">3387</a>，<a href="3404.htm">3404</a>，<a href="4321.htm">4321</a>节）；因此，长、宽、高等空间尺寸表示诸如属于状态的那类事物。其中“长”表示圣洁，“高”表示良善，“宽”表示真理（<a href="650.htm">650</a>，<a href="1613.htm">1613</a>，<a href="3433.htm">3433</a>，<a href="3434.htm">3434</a>节）；故“这地宽阔”表示教会中教义真理的延伸。<br />凡没有意识到圣言中存在某种属灵事物，只知道显现在字义上的东西之人对这种说法必感到惊讶，即：“这地宽阔”表示教会中教义真理的延伸。然而，这种说法的真实性可从圣言中提及“宽”的经文看出来；如以赛亚书：<br />亚述必冲入犹大，涨溢泛滥，直到颈项，他展开翅膀，遍满你宽阔的地。（以赛亚书<a href="http://39-27.cn/赛8.8.htm">8:8</a>）<br />诗篇：<br />耶和华啊，你未曾把我交在仇敌手里；你使我的脚站在宽阔之处。（诗篇<a href="http://39-27.cn/诗31.8.htm">31:8</a>）<br /><br />我在急难中求告耶和华，祂就应允我，把我安置在宽阔之地。（诗篇<a href="http://39-27.cn/诗118.5.htm">118:5</a>）<br />哈巴谷书：<br />我必兴起迦勒底人，就是那残忍暴躁的民族，行走在那地的宽阔处。（哈巴谷书<a href="http://39-27.cn/哈1.6.htm">1:6</a>）<br />此处“宽阔”无非表示教会的真理。<br />“宽”之所以具有这种含义，是因为在灵界，或在天上，主是一切事物的核心，祂是那里的太阳。那些处于良善状态的人更为内在，他们朝向中间的准确位置取决于他们里面的良善的质和量，因此“高”论及良善。那些处于相同程度良善的人也处于相同程度的真理，因而可以说住在距核心相同距离处；因此，“宽”论及真理。所以当人阅读圣言时，与他同在的天使只会将“宽”理解为真理。在圣言的历史部分，如所论述的约柜、祭坛、神殿和城外的空地，涉及这些东西的长、宽、高的维度或尺寸就被理解为良善与真理的状态。以西结书（40至47章）所描述的新地、新耶路撒冷和新殿也一样，它们表示天堂和一个新教会，这从这几章所描述的每个细节可以看出来。启示录中论及新耶路撒冷的地方也是如此，这城是四方的，长宽一样大（启示录<a href="http://39-27.cn/启21.16.htm">21:16</a>）。<br />灵界的内在事物在圣言中被描述为高处的事物，外在事物则被描述为低处的事物（<a href="2148.htm">2148</a>节）；事实上，在这个世界，人无法以其它任何方式来理解内在事物和外在事物，因为他住在时空之中，属于时空的事物进入他的思想观念，并对其中大多数观念具有重要影响。由此也明显可知，涉及尺寸的词，就是高、长、宽等的空间具体尺寸，在灵义上就是决定对良善的情感和对真理的情感之状态的词。</p>

<p align="center"><b>Potts(1905-1910) 4482</b></p><p><b>4482.</b>
And behold the land is broad in spaces before them. That this signifies the extension, namely, of the truth of doctrine, is evident from the signification of "land" as being the church (see just above, 
n. 4480); and from the signification of "broad in spaces," as being extension in respect to truths, thus in respect to the things of doctrine. In the Word, description according to measures does not 
signify measures in the internal sense, but qualities of state; for measures imply spaces, and in the other life there are no spaces or times, but states corresponding thereto (see n. 2625, 2837, 3356, 
3387, 3404, 4321), and therefore the lengths, breadths, and heights of measured space signify such things as belong to state. That "length" signifies holiness, "height" good, and "breadth" truth, 
may be seen above (n. 650, 1613, 3433, 3434), and therefore by a "land broad in spaces" is signified the extension of the truth of doctrine in the church. [2] This signification of the expression "a 
land broad in spaces" must excite wonder in one who is not aware that there is something spiritual in the Word other than what appears in the literal sense, but that nevertheless such is the case may 
be seen from the passages in the Word where "breadth" is mentioned; as in Isaiah: </p>
<p>     Assyria shall go through Judah; he shall inundate and pass through; he shall reach even to the neck, and the extensions 
of his wings shall be the fullness of the breadth of the land (Isa. 8:8). In David: </p>
<p>     O Jehovah Thou hast not shut me up into the hand of the enemy, Thou hast made my feet to stand in breadth 
(Ps. 31:8). In the same: </p>
<p>     Out of straitness I called upon Jah; He answered me in breadth (Ps. 118:5). In Habakkuk: </p>
<p>     I raise up the Chaldeans, a bitter and swift nation that walks in the 
breadths of the land (Hab. 1:6); </p>
<p>where by "breadths" nothing else is signified than the truth of the church. [3] The reason why "breadth" has this signification is that in the spiritual world, or 
in heaven, the Lord is the center of all things, for He is the sun there. They who are in a state of good are interior in proportion to the quality and quantity of the good in which they are, and therefore 
"height" is predicated of good. They who are in a like degree of good are also in a like degree of truth, and therefore are as it were at a like distance, or, so to speak, in the same circumference, 
and hence "breadth" is predicated of truths; and therefore when a man is reading the Word this is what the angels who are with him understand by "breadth." In those historicals of the Word where 
the ark, the altar, the temple, and the spaces outside the cities are treated of, by the dimensions of these in respect to lengths, breadths, and heights, are perceived the states of good and truth. 
The case is similar where the new earth, the new Jerusalem, and the new temple are treated of in Ezekiel (40 to 47), by which are signified heaven and a new church, as may be seen from every particular. 
So also in John, where it is said of the new Jerusalem that it will be foursquare, and its length as great as its breadth (Rev. 21:16). [4] Things which in the spiritual world are interior are described 
in the Word by things that are higher, and things which are exterior by things that are lower (n. 2148); for while a man is in this world he cannot apprehend interior and exterior things in any 
other way, because he is in space and time, and the things of space and time have entered the ideas of his thought, and have tinctured most of these; from which it is evident that terms relating to measure, 
which are limitations of space, such as heights, lengths, and breadths, are in the spiritual sense those which determine the states of the affections of good and the affections of truth. </p>

<p align="center"><b>Elliott(1983-1999) 4482</b></p><p><b>4482.</b>
'Behold, the land is broad and spacious before them' means extension, that is to say, of truth which is the truth of doctrine. This is clear from the meaning of 'the land' as the Church, dealt with just 
above in <a href="4480.htm">4480</a>, and from the meaning of 'broad and spacious' as extension as regards truths, and so as regards those taught by doctrine. When in the Word the measurements of something are given, it 
is not those measurements that are meant in the internal sense but the essential characteristics of a state that is being described. For measurements involve spatial dimensions and in the next life there 
are no intervals of space, as there are no periods of time, but states which correspond to these, see <a href="2625.htm">2625</a>, <a href="2837.htm">2837</a>, <a href="3356.htm">3356</a>, <a href="3387.htm">3387</a>, <a href="3404.htm">3404</a>, <a href="4321.htm">4321</a>. That being so, lengths, breadths, and heights, which are 
spatial measurements, mean the aspects of a state - length meaning holiness, height good, and breadth truth, see <a href="650.htm">650</a>, <a href="1613.htm">1613</a>, <a href="3433.htm">3433</a>, <a href="3434.htm">3434</a>. This then is why 'the land is broad and spacious' means the extension 
of truth which is the truth of doctrine within the Church. </p>
<p></p>
<p><b>[2]</b>
 Anyone who does not know of the existence of anything spiritual in the Word other than that which stands out in the literal sense 
is bound to be amazed by the statement that 'the land is broad and specious' means the extension of truth which is the truth of doctrine within the Church. But the truth of this statement may be established 
from places where 'breadth' is mentioned in the Word, as in Isaiah, </p>
<blockquote>
Asshur will go through Judah, it will deluge it and pass through and will reach even to the neck; and the outstretchings 
of its wings will fill the breadth of the land. <a href="http://bible.gospelcom.net/cgi-bin/bible?passage=Isa%208:8&amp;version=ESV&amp;interface=print&amp;showfn=yes&amp;showxref">Isa 8:8</a>. 
</blockquote>
<p>In David, </p>
<blockquote>
O Jehovah, You have not shut me up into the hand of the enemy. You have made my feet stand in a broad place. <a href="http://bible.gospelcom.net/cgi-bin/bible?passage=Ps%2031:8&amp;version=ESV&amp;interface=print&amp;showfn=yes&amp;showxref">Ps 31:8</a>. 
</blockquote>
<p>In 
the same author, </p>
<blockquote>
Out of my distress I called on Jah; He answered me in a broad place. <a href="http://bible.gospelcom.net/cgi-bin/bible?passage=Ps%20118:5&amp;version=ESV&amp;interface=print&amp;showfn=yes&amp;showxref">Ps 118:5</a>. 
</blockquote>
<p>In Habakkuk, </p>
<p>I am rousing the Chaldeans, a bitter and hasty nation, marching' into the breadths 
of the earth. <a href="http://bible.gospelcom.net/cgi-bin/bible?passage=Hab%201:6&amp;version=ESV&amp;interface=print&amp;showfn=yes&amp;showxref">Hab 1:6</a>. </p>
<p>'Breadths' here means nothing other than the truth of the Church. </p>
<p></p>
<p><b>[3]</b>
 The reason why breadth has this meaning is that in the spiritual world, that is, in heaven, the Lord 
is the centre of all, for He is the Sun there. Those in a state of good are more interior, their exact position towards the middle being determined by the character and the amount of the good present 
in them. This is why 'height' is used in reference to good. Those who are in a similar degree of good are also in a similar degree of truth, and so dwell so to speak at the same distance from the centre, 
or one might say, dwell on the same contour; and this is why 'breadth' is used in reference to truths. Therefore when a person reads the Word the angels present with him do not understand by 'breadth' 
anything other than truths. When in the Historical sections, for example, the ark, the altar, the temple, and the spaces outside cities are referred to, states of good and truth are perceived 
by the dimensions indicating the lengths, breadths, and heights of these. The same is so with the new earth, new Jerusalem, and new Temple - described in Chapters <a href="40.htm">40</a>-<a href="47.htm">47</a> of Ezekiel - by which heaven and 
a new Church are meant, as may be seen from the detailed descriptions in those chapters. So also in John where it is said of the New Jerusalem that it will be foursquare, 'its length being as greet 
as its breadth', <a href="http://bible.gospelcom.net/cgi-bin/bible?passage=Rev%2021:16&amp;version=ESV&amp;interface=print&amp;showfn=yes&amp;showxref">Rev 21:16</a>. </p>
<p></p>
<p><b>[4]</b>
 Things which in the spiritual world are interior are described as those that are higher, while those that are exterior are described by those that are lower, <a href="2148.htm">2148</a>, 
for while in the world, no one can conceive of interior things and exterior ones in any other way, for the reason that he dwells within space and time, and things that belong to space and time have entered 
in among the ideas comprising his thought and have conditioned the majority of these. From this it is also evident that expressions which give the spatial measurements of things such as the height, 
length, and breadth of them, are in the spiritual sense expressions used to indicate the magnitude of affections for good and affections for truth.

`Et terra ecce lata spatiis coram illis': quod significet extensionem, nempe veri quod est doctrinae, constat a significatione `terrae' quod sit Ecclesia, de qua mox supra n. 4480; et ex significatione 
`lata spatiis' quod sit extensio quoad vera, ita quoad illa quae sunt doctrinae: in Verbo quae describuntur secundum mensuras, in sensu interno non significant mensuras sed qualia status; mensurae 
enim involvunt spatia, et in altera vita non sunt spatia sicut nec tempora, sed illis correspondent status, videatur n. 2625, 2837, 3356, 3387, 3404, 4321; et quia ita, longitudines, latitudines 
et altitudines, quae {1} sunt spatii mensurati, significant talia quae sunt status; quod longitudo significet {2} sanctum, altitudo bonum, et latitudo verum, videatur n. 650, 1613, 3433, 3434; 
inde est {3} quod per `terram latam spatiis' significetur extensio veri quod est doctrinae in Ecclesia.  [2] Qui non novit dari in Verbo (t)aliud spirituale quam quod exstat in sensu litterali, non 
potest aliter quam mirari quod dicatur per `terram latam spatiis' significari extensionem veri quod est doctrinae in Ecclesia; sed quod usque se ita habeat, constare potest a locis ubi latitudo in 
Verbo nominatur: ut apud Esaiam,           Asshur ibit per Jehudam, inundabit et transibit, usque      ad collum pertinget, et erunt extensiones alarum ejus      plenitudo latitudinis terrae, viii 
8: </p>
<p>apud Davidem,           Jehovah non conclusisti me in manum inimici, stare      fecisti in latitudine pedes meos, Ps. xxxi 9 [A. V. 8]: </p>
<p>apud eundem,           Ex angustia invocavi Jah, respondet 
mihi in latitudine,      Ps. (x)cxviii 5: </p>
<p>apud Habakkuk,           Ego exsuscitans Chaldaeos, gentem amaram et celerem,      ambulantem in latitudines terrae, i 6; </p>
<p>per `latitudines' ibi non 
aliud significatur quam verum Ecclesiae: </p>
<p>[3] causa quod latitudo id significet, est quia in mundo spirituali, seu in caelo, est Dominus centrum omnium, Ipse enim est Sol ibi; qui in statu boni sunt, 
interiores sunt secundum quale et quantum boni in quo sunt; inde praedicatur `altitudo' de bono; qui sunt {4} in simili gradu boni, etiam sunt {5} in simili gradu veri, et sic quasi in simili distantia 
aut, ut ita dicatur, in eadem peripheria, inde praedicatur `latitudo' de veris; quapropter non aliud per latitudinem intelligitur ab angelis qui apud hominem sunt cum Verbum legit; ut in historicis 
ejus, ubi {6} agitur de arca, de altari, de templo, de spatiis extra urbes, tunc per dimensiones ibi quoad longitudines, latitudines et altitudines, percipiuntur status boni et veri; similiter 
ubi de nova terra, Nova Hierosolyma, et de novo templo, apud Ezechielem xl-xlvii; per quae (o)quod significetur caelum et Nova Ecclesia, ex singulis ibi constare potest: ita etiam apud Johannem 
ubi de Nova Hierosolyma dicitur,           Quod erit quadrangularis, et (t)ejus longitudo tanta      quanta latitudo, Apoc. xxi 16. [4] Quae interiora sunt in mundo spirituali, describuntur per superiora 
et quae exteriora, per inferiora, n. 2148, homo {7} (t)enim non aliter capit interiora et exteriora cum est in mundo, quia est in spatio et in tempore, et quae spatii et temporis sunt, ejus 
cogitationis ideas intrarunt, et plerasque imbuerunt; inde etiam patet quod illa quae sunt mensurarum, quae {8} sunt limitationes spatii, sicut altitudines, longitudines et latitudines, sint in 
sensu spirituali illa quae determinant status affectionum boni et affectionum veri.      @1 quia$      @2 sit$      @3 patet$      @4 after boni$      @5 after veri$      @6 cum$      @7 after
