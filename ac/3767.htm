<h3 align="center" class="ired">属天的奥秘 第3767节</h3>
<h4 align="center"></h4><p><strong>3767.</strong>“看哪，有三群羊卧在井旁”表教会的神圣事物及其教义事物。这从“三”和“羊群”的含义清楚可知：“三”是指神圣之物（<a href="720.htm">720</a>，<a href="901.htm">901</a>节）；“羊群”是指那些构成教会的事物，因而是指教义事物。具体地说，“羊群”表示那些在教会中，学习并充满仁之善和信之真的人。在这种情况下，“牧人”就表示教导这些事物的人。一般来说，“羊群”表示所有那些处于良善，因而属于主在世界各地的教会之人。由于他们被引入良善与真理都是藉着教义事物，故“羊群”也表示教义事物。因为就内义而言，这个词既表示决定一个人品质的事物，也表示具有这种品质的此人自己。因为对主体（在这种情况下，主体就是人）的理解，是从知道是什么使人成为一个人开始的。<br />这就是为何我们反复说明名字既表示真实事物，也表示具有真实事物的人。如“推罗”和“西顿”既表示对良善与真理的认知，也表示具有这些认知的人。“埃及”表示记忆知识，“亚述”表示推理；然而，这两个名字同时也表示具有记忆知识或推理的人；其它一切名字也一样。但在天上的天使当中，言语是由没有任何人物概念的真实事物构成的，因而是由普遍观念构成的。这是因为他们以这种方式将数不清的事物包括在他们所说的话中；尤其是因为他们将一切良善与真理归于主，丝毫不归于自己。结果，构成其言语的观念唯独由主确定。由此可见，为何说“羊群”既表示教会，也表示教义事物。经上之所以说“羊群卧在井旁”，是因为教义事物出自圣言。“井”表示圣言，如刚才所述（<a href="3765.htm">3765</a>节）。</p>

And behold there three droves of the flock lying by it. That this signifies the holy things of churches and of doctrinal things, is evident from the signification of "three," as being that which is holy 
(n. 720, 901); and from the signification of "droves of the flock," as being those things which are of the church, thus doctrinal things; specifically, a "flock" signifies those who are within the 
church, and who learn and become imbued with the goods which are of charity, and the truths which are of faith; and in this case a "shepherd" signifies one who teaches these things; but in general a 
"flock" signifies all those who are in good, thus who belong to the Lord's church in the universal world; and inasmuch as all these are introduced into good and truth by means of doctrinal things, therefore 
by a "flock" are also signified doctrinal things. For in the internal sense the things which determine the quality of a man, and the man himself who is of such a quality, are meant by the same 
expression; for the subject, which is man, is understood from that by virtue of which he is man. [2] For this reason it has been repeatedly stated that names signify actual things, and also signify those 
to whom such things appertain-as that "Tyre" and "Zidon" signify the knowledges of good and truth, and also those who are in such knowledges; and that "Egypt" signifies memory-knowledge, and "Asshur" 
reasoning, yet there are also understood those who are in these; and so with every other name. But the speech in heaven among the angels is effected by means of actual things, without the idea of 
persons; thus by universals; and this for the reason that in this way they comprise countless things in their discourse; and especially is this the case because they attribute all good and truth to the 
Lord, and nothing to themselves; the result of which is that the ideas of their speech are not determined to any but the Lord alone. From all this we can now see whence it is that a "flock" is said 
to signify churches, and also doctrinal things. Droves of a flock are said to be "lying by the well," because the doctrinal things are from the Word. (That a "well" denotes the Word, has been stated just 
above, n. 3765.) </p>

<p align="center"><b>Elliott(1983-1999) 3767</b></p><p><b>3767.</b>
'And behold, three droves of a flock there, lying nearby it' means the holy things that constitute the Churches and their matters of doctrine. This is clear from the meaning of 'three' as that which 
is holy, dealt with in <a href="720.htm">720</a>, <a href="901.htm">901</a>, and from the meaning of 'droves of a flock' as the things that constitute a Church, and so as matters of doctrine. Specifically 'a flock' means people who are within the 
Church, and who are learning and being endued with forms of good which are the goods of charity and forms of truth which are the truths of faith. In this case 'a shepherd' means one who teaches those 
things. In general however 'a flock' means all people who are governed by good and so belong to the Lord's Church throughout the whole world. And since they are all led into what is good and true by 
means of matters of doctrine, therefore 'a flock' also means matters of doctrine. For the things which make a person such, and the person himself who is such, are both meant in the internal sense by 
the same expression. For one's understanding of the subject - which in this case is the human being - begins with knowing what makes anyone a human being. </p>
<p></p>
<p><b>[2]</b>
 This is why it is stated many times that 
names mean real things and also the people with whom these real things exist. For example, 'Tyre and Sidon' means cognitions concerning what is good and true and also the people who possess those 
cognitions. 'Egypt' means knowledge and 'Asshur' reasoning, but these names are used at the same time to mean people with whom that knowledge or reasoning is present. And the same is so with every other 
name. But speech among angels in heaven is composed of real things that do not involve any concept of persons, and so is composed of universal ideas. The reason for this is that in this way they include 
countless things in what they say, and in particular for the reason that they attribute everything good and true to the Lord and nothing to themselves. Consequently the ideas which compose their 
kind of speech know no limits except insofar as those ideas involve the Lord. From these considerations it is now evident why 'a flock' is said to mean the Churches and also their matters of doctrine. 
'Droves of a flock' are said to be 'lying nearby the well' because the Word is the source of matters of doctrine - 'a well' meaning the Word, as stated just above in <a href="3765.htm">3765</a>. </p>

`Et ecce ibi tres catervae gregis cubantes juxta illum': </p>
<p>quod significet sancta Ecclesiarum et doctrinalium, constat ex significatione `trium' quod sint sanctum, de qua n. 720, 901; ex significatione 
`catervarum gregis' quod sint illa quae sunt Ecclesiae, ita doctrinalia; in specie `grex' significat illos qui intra Ecclesiam sunt, ac discunt et imbuunt bona quae charitatis et vera quae fidei, 
et tunc pastor qui docet illa; in genere (t)autem `grex' significat omnes illos qui in bono sunt, ita qui ad Ecclesiam Domini in universo terrarum orbe pertinent; et quia omnes illi per doctrinalia 
introducuntur in bonum et verum, ideo etiam per `gregem' significantur doctrinalia; illa enim quae faciunt ut talis sit homo, ac ipse homo qui talis est, per eandem vocem in sensu interno intelligitur; 
[2] subjectum enim quod est homo, intelligitur ex eo ex quo est homo; inde est quod aliquoties dicatur quod nomina significent res, et quoque illos apud quos eae res sunt; sicut Tyrus et 
Zidon, quod significent cognitiones boni et veri, et quoque illos qui in cognitionibus illis sunt; et quod Aegyptus significet scientiam, et Asshur ratiocinationem, sed intelliguntur tunc ii qui in 
illis sunt, ita in reliquis; {1}at loquela in caelo apud angelos' per res absque idea personarum {2}fit, ita per universalia, et hoc ex causa quia sic comprehendunt innumerabilia, at imprimis ex causa 
quia omne bonum et verum tribuunt Domino, ac sibimet nihil, inde non determinatae sunt ideae loquelae illorum quam ad solum Dominum: ex his nunc patet unde est, quod `grex' dicatur significare 
Ecclesias, et quoque doctrinalia. `Catervae gregis' dicuntur `cubantes juxta {3}puteum' quia ex Verbo doctrinalia; quod `puteus' sit Verbum, mox supra n. 3765 dictam est. @1 at usque in caelo apud 
angelos talis loquela est, ut$ @2 fiat$ @3 i illum, nempe$ </p>
