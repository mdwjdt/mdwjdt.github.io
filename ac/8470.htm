<h3 align="center" class="ired">属天的奥秘 第8470节</h3>
<h4 align="center"></h4><p><strong>8470.</strong>“各人为凡在帐棚里的人取它”表与他们共享，由此一种共享的良善。这从“帐棚”的含义清楚可知，“帐棚”是指良善方面的一个社群。“帐棚”在此和“房屋”所表相同，因为他们旅居时，就住在帐棚里。各人为凡在帐棚里的人取这个命令表示与他们共享，因而也表示由此一种共享的良善。由于这些话涉及发生在天上社群当中的那些事，如刚才所述（<a href="8469.htm">8469</a>节），所以有必要进一步说一说这些社群是怎么回事，好叫人们能由此知道何谓在一个社群里与其他人共享，以及由此产生的一种共享良善，就是“各人为凡在帐棚里的人取”这个命令所表示的事。 <br />在天堂，一个社群的每个成员都与社群里的所有人共享他的良善，那里的所有人也与每个成员共享他们的良善。由此产生总体上所有人的良善，也就是一种共享的良善。该良善与其它社群的共享良善联结起来，由此产生一种更为共享的良善，最终产生一种最为共享的良善。这种共享在天堂继续下去，并使他们成为一个整体。他们就像人的各个器官、肢体和内脏，尽管各种各样，并不相同，然而却通过以同样的方式彼此联系而形成一个整体。唯独爱，也就是属灵的结合，才有可能把各种各样的良善联结起来。将一切事物，无论总体还是具体，形成并排列成秩序的总体能力就是从主发出的神性之爱的神性良善。</p>

<p align="center"><b>Potts(1905-1910) 8470</b></p><p><b>8470.</b>
Take ye everyone for him who is in his tent. That this signifies communication with them, and from this the general good, is evident from the signification of a "tent," as being a society as to good; 
"tent" here signifies the like as "house," for when they sojourned they were in tents. That every man should take for him who was there, signifies communication with them, thus also from this the general 
good. As these words involve those things which come forth in the societies in heaven (as was said just above, see n. 8469), it shall be told further how the case is with those societies, in order 
that it may thereby be known what is meant by communication with those in the society, and with the general good arising therefrom, which is signified by "everyone taking for him who was in his tent." 
Everyone in a society in heaven communicates his good to all who are in the society, and all therein communicate with each one, whence arises the good of all in general, that is, the general good. 
This good is communicated to the general good of other societies, whence arises a good still more general, and finally one most general. Such is the communication in heaven, and hence it is that they 
are a one, just as are the organs, members, and viscera in man, which, although various and dissimilar, nevertheless by such communications form a one. Such a communication of goods is possible only through 
love, which is spiritual conjunction. The universal thing that forms and brings into order all things in general and in particular is the Divine good of Divine love from the Lord. </p>

<p align="center"><b>Elliott(1983-1999) 8470</b></p><p><b>8470.</b>
'Take it, each for whoever is in his tent' means sharing with them, and therefore a common good. This is clear from the meaning of 'tent' as a community in respect of good. 'Tent' here is similar in 
meaning to house, for during their wanderings they lived in tents. The command that each should take for whoever was in his tent means sharing with them, and so also therefore a common good. Since all 
this has to do with the situation that comes about among communities in heaven, as stated immediately above in <a href="8469.htm">8469</a>, something further will be stated about it, in order that people may know what to understand 
by sharing with others in a community, and by a common good resulting from this - the things meant by the command that each should take for whoever was in his tent. </p>
<p></p>
<p><b>[2]</b>
 Each member of a community 
in heaven shares his good with all in the community, and all there share theirs with each member. From this arises the good held in common by all, called a common good. This good links up with 
the common good in other communities, and from this arises an even more common good, and finally a most common. This kind of sharing goes on in heaven; and it makes them all a single whole. They are 
exactly like a person's organs and members, which - though various and dissimilar - nevertheless present themselves as a single whole by communicating with one another in similar ways. Love alone, which 
is spiritual togetherness, makes possible the linking of those varieties of good. The overall power forming and arranging into order every single one is the Divine Good of Divine Love emanating from 
the Lord. </p>

`Quisque ei qui in tentorio suo, accipite': quod significet communicationem cum illis, et inde bonum commune, constat ex significatione `tentorii' quod sit societas quoad bonum; `tentorium' hic simile 
significat cum domo, cum enim peregrinabantur fuerunt in tentoriis.  {1} Quod quisque acciperet ei qui ibi, significat communicationem cum illis, ita quoque inde commune bonum.  Haec quia involvunt 
illa quae in societatibus in caelo existunt, ut mox supra n. 8469 (d)est dictum, adhuc dicetur quomodo cum illis se habet, ut inde sciatur quid intelligitur per communicationem cum illis in societate, 
et cum communi bono quod inde, quae significantur per quod `quisque ei qui in tentorio suo acciperet'; unusquisque in societate 2 in caelo communicat suum bonum cum omnibus qui in societate, et omnes 
ibi communicant cum unoquovis, inde existit bonum omnium in communi, hoc est, commune bonum; hoc bonum communicatur cum communi bono aliarum societatum, inde existit bonum adhuc communius, et tandem 
communissimum; talis communicatio est iri caelo, et inde est quod unum sint, prorsus sicut organa, membra, et viscera in homine, quae tametsi varia ac dissimilia sunt, usque tamen per {2}tales communicationes 
unum sistunt; talis communicatio bonorum datur unice per amorem, quae est conjunctio spiritualis; universale formans (c)ac ordinans omnia et singula est Divinum Bonum Divini Amoris a Domino. 	@1 
i ita$ 	@2 talem communicationem unum hominem constituunt$ </p>
