<h3 align="center" class="ired">属天的奥秘 第400节</h3>
<h4 align="center"></h4><p><strong>400.</strong>“该隐与妻子同房，他妻子就怀孕，生了以诺”，这句话表示这样的分裂或异端自己又产生另一个，这可从前节所述，也可从第一节中“那人和他妻子夏娃生了该隐”的解释明显可知。因此，接下来的事物也是类似的“怀孕”和“生出”，无论是属教会的，还是属异端的，人们藉此形成族谱，因为他们就是这样相互关联的。从一个已确立的异端会生出更多异端。</p>

<p><strong>[NCE]400.</strong> Cain knew his wife, and she conceived and delivered Enoch, means that this schism or heresy spontaneously produced another. This is the obvious conclusion from all that precedes. It also makes sense in light of verse <a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_400/bible_king-james-version_genesis_4_1" target=_top>1</a>, which says that the human and his wife, Eve, gave birth to Cain; later developments are similar conceptions and births, whether it is the church or heresies that reproduce themselves. For these offshoots the people [of the earliest church] established a genealogy,{*1} because they resemble family trees: from a single heresy, once seized upon, many others are born.<br /><br /><strong>Footnotes:</strong><br />{*1} Swedenborg has more to say about this kind of genealogy at <a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_400/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_339" target=_top>339</a>.

That "Cain knew his wife, and she conceived, and bare Enoch" signifies that this schism or heresy produced another from itself, is evident from what has been previously said, as well as from what is 
stated in the first verse, that the Man and Eve his wife produced Cain; so that the things which now follow are similar conceptions and births, whether of the church, or of heresies, whereof they formed 
a genealogy, for these are similarly related to each other. From one heresy that is conceived there are born a host of them. </p>

<p align="center"><b>Elliott(1983-1999) 400</b></p><p><b>400.</b>
That 'Cain knew his wife, and she conceived and bore Enoch' that this schism or heresy produced another from itself follows plainly from the verses preceding this, as well as from the statement in verse 1 about Man and Eve his wife begetting Cain. What follow now therefore are similar conceptions and births - of the Church as well as of heresies - which men established as a genealogy, for this was 
how they were interrelated. From one established heresy many more are born.  </p>

<p align="center"><b>Latin(1748-1756) 400</b>
</p><b>400.</b>
Quod 'Cain cognoverit uxorem suam, conceperit, et pepererit Hanochum' significet quod schisma hoc seu haeresis aliam ex se produxerit, sequitur manifeste ex praecedentibus, tum ex versu primo, quod 
'Homo et havah uxor ejus genuerint Cainum'; ita quae sequuntur, sunt conceptus et partus similes, tam Ecclesiae quam haeresium, quarum instituebant genealogiam, nam se similiter habent; ex una capta haeresi 
nascuntur plures. </p>
