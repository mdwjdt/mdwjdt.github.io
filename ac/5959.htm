<h3 align="center" class="ired">属天的奥秘 第5959节</h3>
<h4 align="center"></h4><p><strong>5959.</strong>“母驴十匹，驮着谷物、饼”表良善之真理和真理之良善，以及大量服务类的事物。这从“十”、“母驴”、“谷物”和“饼”的含义清楚可知：“十”是指大量，如前所述（<a href="5958.htm">5958</a>节）；“母驴”是指服务类的事物，如刚才所述（<a href="5958.htm">5958</a>节）；“谷物”是指真理之良善（<a href="5295.htm">5295</a>，<a href="5410.htm">5410</a>节），但在此是指良善之真理，因为它来自内在属天层，即“约瑟”；“饼”是指该真理的良善（<a href="276.htm">276</a>，<a href="680.htm">680</a>，<a href="2165.htm">2165</a>，<a href="2177.htm">2177</a>，<a href="3478.htm">3478</a>，<a href="3735.htm">3735</a>，<a href="4211.htm">4211</a>，<a href="4217.htm">4217</a>，<a href="4735.htm">4735</a>，<a href="4976.htm">4976</a>节）。至于“谷物”在此处表示良善之真理，但在别处却表示真理之良善，情况是这样：当流注来自内在属天层时的含义不同于当流注来自内在属灵层时的含义。从内在属天层流入之物无非是良善，诚然，它含有真理在里面，但这真理是良善。而从内在属灵层流入之物无非是真理，它一旦成为生活的事，就被称为真理之良善。正因如此，“谷物”有时表示真理之良善，有时表示良善之真理，在此表示良善之真理，因为它从内在属天层，即“约瑟”流出。母驴驮着谷物和饼，公驴驮着埃及的美物；这是因为“公驴”表示在与真理有关的情况下的服务类事物，“母驴”则表示在与良善有关的情况下的服务类事物。因此，公驴驮着诸如适合它们的那类事物，母驴则驮着诸如适合它们的那类事物。若不是这种情况，就没有必要提及它们是“公驴”和“母驴”，又说明前者驮的是什么，后者驮的又是什么。</p>

And ten she-asses carrying grain and bread. That this signifies the truth of good and the good of truth, also with many things of service, is evident from the signification of "ten," as being much (as 
above, n. 5958); from the signification of "she-asses," as being things of service (as also just above, 5958); from the signification of "grain," as being the good of truth (n. 5295, 5410), but here 
the truth of good, because from the internal celestial which is "Joseph;" and from the signification of "bread," as being the good of this truth (n. 276, 680, 2165, 2177, 3478, 3735, 4211, 4217, 4735, 
4976). In regard to "grain" signifying the truth of good, and in other places the good of truth, the case is this. The significations are different when the influx is from the internal celestial, from 
what they are when it is from the internal spiritual. That which flows in from the internal celestial is nothing but good, which indeed has truth within it, but this truth is good. But that which flows 
in from the internal spiritual is nothing but truth, which when it becomes of the life is called the "good of truth." Hence then it is that "grain" sometimes signifies the good of truth, and sometimes 
the truth of good, here the truth of good, because from the internal celestial which is "Joseph." That she-asses carried the grain and bread, and he-asses the good of Egypt, is because by "he-asses" 
are signified things of service insofar as they relate to truth, and by "she-asses" are signified things of service insofar as they relate to good. For this reason the he-asses carried such things 
as were suitable for them, and the she-asses such as were suitable for them. Unless this had been the case there would have been no need to mention that there were asses and she-asses, and what the 
one and the other carried. </p>

<p align="center"><b>Elliott(1983-1999) 5959</b></p><p><b>5959.</b>
'And ten she-asses carrying grain and bread' means the truth of good and the good of truth, also together with much of a subservient kind. This is clear from the meaning of 'ten' as much, as above in <a href="5958.htm">5958</a>; from the meaning of 'she-asses' as that which is of a subservient kind, as also immediately above in <a href="5958.htm">5958</a>; from the meaning of 'grain' as the good of truth, dealt with in <a href="5295.htm">5295</a>, <a href="5410.htm">5410</a>, in this case 
the truth of good since it comes from the internal celestial, which is 'Joseph'; and from the meaning of' bread' as the good of that truth, dealt with in <a href="276.htm">276</a>, <a href="680.htm">680</a>, <a href="1165.htm">1165</a>, <a href="2177.htm">2177</a>, <a href="3478.htm">3478</a>, <a href="3775.htm">3775</a>, <a href="4111.htm">4111</a>, <a href="4117.htm">4117</a>, 
<a href="4735.htm">4735</a>, <a href="4976.htm">4976</a>. As regards 'grain' - that here it means the truth of good but elsewhere the good of truth - the situation is this: The meaning is different when an influx from the internal celestial is 
the subject from when an influx from the internal spiritual is the subject. What flows in from the internal celestial is nothing other than good, which does, it is true, hold truth within it, though 
that truth is good. But what flows in from the internal spiritual is nothing other than truth, which is called the good of truth once it has been made a matter of life. In this lies the reason why at 
one point 'grain' means the good of truth, and at another the truth of good - here the truth of good because it flows from the internal celestial, which is 'Joseph'. The reason the female asses carried 
'grain and bread' but the male asses 'the good of Egypt' is that the males mean subservient factual knowledge insofar as this has reference to truth, while the females mean the same insofar as it has 
reference to good. Therefore the burdens carried by the male asses were of a kind appropriate to male asses, and the burdens carried by the female asses of a kind appropriate to female ones. Otherwise 
there would have been no need to mention that they were 'asses' and 'she-asses', or to say what the former carried and what the latter. </p>

`Et decem asinos portantes frumentum et panem': quod significet boni verum et veri bonum, etiam cum multis servitiis, constat ex significatione `decem' quod sint multum, ut supra n. 5958; ex significatione 
`asinorum' quod sint servitia, ut quoque mox supra n. 5958; ex significatione `frumenti' quod sit bonum veri, de qua n. 5295, 5410, hic autem boni verum quia a caelesti interno quod `Joseph'; 
et a significatione `panis' quod sit veri illius bonum, de qua n. 276, 680, 2165, 2177, 3478, 3735, 4211, 4217, 4735, 4976. Cum hoc quod `frumentum' significet boni verum, et alibi (t)veri bonum, ita 
se habet: cum significationibus aliter se habet cum agitur de influxu a caelesti interno, et aliter cum a spirituali interno; quod influit a caelesti interno, non est nisi quam bonum, quod (t)quidem in 
se verum habet, sed {1}hoc verum est bonum; quod autem influit a spirituali interno, non est nisi quam verum, quod cum factum (x)vitae, appellatur {2} bonum veri; inde nunc est quod `frumentum' significet 
nunc bonum veri, et nunc boni verum, hic boni verum quia (c)ex caelesti interno quod `Joseph'. Quod `asinae portaverint frumentum et panem' ac `asini bonum Aegypti' est quia per `asinos' significantur 
{3}servitia quatenus se referunt ad {4}verum, et per `asinas' significantur {3}servitia quatenus se referunt ad bonum; {5}ideo super asinis portabantur talia quae {6}illis conveniebant, et super
