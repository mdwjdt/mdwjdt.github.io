<h3 align="center" class="ired">属天的奥秘 第9481节</h3>
<h4 align="center"></h4><p><strong>9481.</strong>“你们要照我所指示你的居所的样式”表主所在天堂的一个代表。这从“居所的样式”的含义清楚可知，“居所的样式”是指天堂的一个代表；因为“样式”表示一个代表，“居所”表示天堂。“样式”表示一个代表的原因是，天上的神性事物也以可见的形状显现，这些可见事物就是代表。“居所”表示主所在的天堂（参看<a href="8269.htm">8269</a>，<a href="8309.htm">8309</a>节）。从先知书明显可知代表是何性质；如约翰所写的启示录，其中描述了灯台（启示录<a href="http://39-27.cn/启1.12.htm">1:12</a>）；周围有二十四个宝座的一个宝座，宝座面前的四活物（启示录<a href="http://39-27.cn/启4.2.htm">4:2</a>ff）；七印封上的书卷（启示录5章）；当印被揭开时出来的马（启示录6章）；穿着各种各样的衣服，拿着瓶或碗的天使（启示录9-10，15章）；一匹白马（启示录19章）；最后描述了新耶路撒冷，它的城墙、城门、根基，以及高、宽、长（启示录21-22章）。其他先知也描述了类似景象。<br />所有这些景象都是诸如在天堂不断出现在天使眼前、以可见的形状将属于爱之良善的神性属天事物和属于信之良善的神性属灵事物呈现出来的那类代表。这些事物总起来由帐幕和其中的物体来代表，如柜子本身，摆有陈设饼的桌子、香坛、灯台，以及其它一切物体。因此，当这些物体因是神性属天和属灵事物的外在形式而被进行神圣敬拜时的百姓看到时，这些物体所代表的那类事物便在天堂引起注意。如前所述，这些事物就是属于对主之爱的良善的神性属天事物，和属于对主之信的良善的神性属灵事物。该教会的一切代表在天堂就是这种效果。要知道，一个人总有灵人和天使与他同在；离了他们，人就不能存活。同样要知道，此人通过他们而与主相联，人类，以及天堂也以这种方式而持续存在。由此可见，代表，以及教会的仪式建立在以色列民族当中的目的是什么。还可以看出赐下圣言的目的是什么，在圣言中，字义上所提到的一切事物都对应于存在于天堂中的神性事物；因此，其中所提到的一切事物都是代表，一切话都具有灵义。人由此与天堂相联系，并通过天堂与主相联系。没有这种联系，人就没有任何生命，因为若不与生命的一切显现所来自的生命的实际本质存在相联系，没有人能拥有任何生命。<br />不过，对那些以为生命从本质上存在于一个人自己里面，并且一个人离了灵人或天使，因而离了经由天堂从神性而来的流注也能存活的人来说，这些事是无法理解的。而事实上，与神性没有联系的一切事物都会灭亡，不复存在。没有任何事物能离了先于它自身之物，因而离了神性，也就是首先的，自有永有者，即耶和华而存在；因此，它也不可能持续存在，因为持续存在就是不断产生。“居所”因表示主所在的天堂，故也表示爱和信之良善，因为这些构成天堂；并且由于一切良善皆来自主，天堂凭它对主的爱和信而被称为天堂，所以“居所”在至高意义上也表示主；这明显可见于相关经文（以赛亚书<a href="http://39-27.cn/赛63.15.htm">63:15</a>；耶利米书<a href="http://39-27.cn/耶25.30.htm">25:30</a>；以西结书<a href="http://39-27.cn/结37.26.htm">37:26</a>，<a href="http://39-27.cn/结37.27.htm">27</a>；诗篇<a href="http://39-27.cn/诗26.8.htm">26:8</a>；<a href="http://39-27.cn/诗43.3.htm">43:3</a>；<a href="http://39-27.cn/诗90.1.htm">90:1</a>；<a href="http://39-27.cn/诗91.9.htm">91:9</a>；出埃及记<a href="http://39-27.cn/出15.13.htm">15:13</a>；申命记<a href="http://39-27.cn/申12.5.htm">12:5</a>，以及其它经文）。由此明显可知，帐幕被称为“圣所”和“耶和华的居所”是由于这种代表。</p>

According to all that I show thee, the form of the Habitation. That this signifies a representative of heaven where the Lord is, is evident from the signification of "the form of the Habitation," as 
being a representative of heaven; for a "form" denotes a representative, and "the Habitation" denotes heaven. That a "form" denotes a representative, is because the Divine things in the heavens are also 
presented to view in a form. These visible things are representatives. (That "the Habitation" denotes heaven where the Lord is, see n. 8269, 8309.) The nature of the representatives that appear in 
heaven is evident from the prophets; as from John in Revelation; the lampstands (Rev. 1:12); a throne with four and twenty thrones around it, and four animals before the throne (Rev. 4:2, and following 
verses); a book sealed with seven seals (Rev. 5); horses going forth when the seals were opened (chap. 6); angels variously arrayed, with vials (Rev. 9-10, 15) a white horse (Rev. 19); and lastly the 
New Jerusalem, of which the walls, gates, foundation, and its height, breadth, and length are described (Rev. 21-22). There are similar things in other prophets.  [2] All these things are representatives 
such as continually appear before the angels in the heavens, and present in a visible form the Divine celestial things that belong to the good of love, and the Divine spiritual things that belong 
to the good of faith. The sum total of such things was represented by the tabernacle and the things that were in it; as by the ark itself; by the table on which were the breads; by the altar of incense; 
by the lampstand; and by all other things. As these things were forms of Divine celestial and spiritual things, therefore when they were seen by the people at the time they were in holy worship, 
there were then presented in heaven the things that were represented; which as before said were the Divine celestial things that belong to the good of love to the Lord, and the Divine spiritual things 
that belong to the good of faith in the Lord. Such an effect in heaven had all the representatives of that church. Be it known that there are always spirits and angels with man, and that he cannot live 
without them; in like manner that through them man has connection with the Lord, and that in this way the human race and also heaven subsist. From this it can be seen to what end the representatives 
and also the rituals of the church were instituted among the Israelitish nation; also to what end the Word was given, wherein all things of the literal sense correspond to Divine things which are in 
heaven; thus wherein all the things are representative, and all the words significative. From this, man has connection with heaven, and through heaven with the Lord. Without this connection man would 
have no life whatever, for without connection with the very Being of Life from whom comes all the manifestation of life, no one has any life.  [3] But these things are not apprehended by those who 
believe that life is in man himself; and that he lives independently of spirits or angels; thus without any influx through heaven from the Divine; when yet everything unconnected with the Divine perishes 
and becomes nothing; and nothing can possibly exist without what is prior to itself, thus without the Divine, which is the First, and the Very Being from Itself, that is, Jehovah; and consequently 
neither can it subsist, for to subsist is to perpetually come forth. As the "Habitation" signifies heaven where the Lord is, it also signifies the good of love and of faith, for these make heaven; and 
because all good is from the Lord, and heaven is called heaven from love and faith in the Lord, therefore also in the supreme sense the "Habitation" signifies the Lord; as is plain in Isa. 63:15; Jer. 
25:30; Ezek. 37:26, 27; Ps. 26:8; 43:3; 90:1; 91:9; Exod. 15:13; Deut. 12:5; and in other places. From this it is evident that the tabernacle was called "the sanctuary," and "the Habitation of Jehovah," 
because of this representation. </p>

'In accordance with all that I show you, the pattern of the dwelling-place' means a representative of heaven where the Lord is. This is clear from the meaning of 'the pattern of the dwelling-place' as 
a representative of heaven; for 'the pattern' means a representative, and 'the dwelling-place' means heaven. The reason why 'the pattern' means a representative is that Divine realities in heaven are 
also manifested in visible shapes, which are representatives. For the meaning of 'the dwelling-place' as heaven where the Lord is, see <a href="8269.htm">8269</a>, <a href="8309.htm">8309</a>. What the representatives that appear in heaven are 
like is clear in the prophets, for example in John's Book of Revelation, in which he describes lampstands, Chapter 1:12ff; a throne with twenty-four thrones around it, and four living creatures before 
the throne, Chapter 4:2ff; a book sealed with seven seals, Chapter <a href="5.htm">5</a>; horses going out when the seals were opened, Chapter <a href="6.htm">6</a>; angels who are clothed in various ways and have bowls, Chapters <a href="9.htm">9</a>,<a href="10.htm">10</a>,<a href="15.htm">15</a>,<a href="16.htm">16</a>; 
a white horse, Chapter <a href="19.htm">19</a>; and at length a new Jerusalem, its walls, gates, foundations, height, breadth, and length, Chapters <a href="21.htm">21</a>, <a href="22.htm">22</a>. Similar sights are also described by other prophets.  </p>
<p></p>
<p><b>[2]</b>
 All 
those sights are representatives such as appear unceasingly in heaven before angels' eyes, manifesting in visible shapes the Divine celestial realities that belong to the good of love and the Divine 
spiritual realities that belong to the good of faith. Such realities taken all together were represented by the tabernacle and its contents, that is, the ark itself, the table on which loaves were laid, 
the altar of incense, the lampstand, and everything else. Therefore when these objects, being outward forms of Divine celestial and spiritual realities, were beheld by the people while they were 
engaged in holy acts of worship, such realities as were represented by those objects were brought to notice in heaven. These, as stated above, were the Divine celestial realities that belong to the good 
of love to the Lord and the Divine spiritual realities that belong to the good of faith in the Lord. All the representatives of that Church had that kind of effect in heaven. It should be realized 
that a person always has spirits and angels present with him and that a person cannot live without them. It should likewise be realized that through them the person is linked to the Lord, and that in 
this way the human race, and heaven too, is kept in being. From this one can see what purpose was served by the representatives and also the ritual observances of the Church established among the Israelite 
nation. One can also see what purpose is served by the Word, in which all things mentioned in the sense of the letter correspond to Divine realities that exist in heaven, thus in which all the objects 
mentioned are representative and all the words used carry a spiritual meaning. This is what brings about the linking of a person to heaven, and through heaven to the Lord. Without that link the 
person would have no life whatever, for without being linked to the actual Essential Being (Esse) of life, from which the Coming-into-Being (Existere) of life emanates, no one has life.  </p>
<p></p>
<p><b>[3]</b>
 But these 
considerations are unintelligible to those who think that life exists essentially in a person himself and that a person lives without spirits or angels, thus without influx from the Divine by way 
of heaven. But in actual fact anything that is not linked to the Divine perishes and ceases to exist. Indeed nothing can ever come into being without that which is prior to itself, thus without the Divine, 
who is the First and is self-existent Being (Esse) or Jehovah; nor consequently can it remain in being, for remaining in being is constant coming-into-being. Because 'the dwelling-place' means 
heaven where the Lord is, it also means the good of love and faith, since these compose heaven; and because all good comes from the Lord, and heaven is called heaven by virtue of its love to and faith 
in the Lord, 'the dwelling-place' also means in the highest sense the Lord, as is evident in Isa. 63:15; Jer. 25:30; Ezek. 37:26, <a href="27.htm">27</a>; Ps. 26:8; 43:3; 90:1; 91:9; Exod. 15:13; Deut. 12:5, <a href="11.htm">11</a>; and other 
places. From this it is clear that the tabernacle was called Jehovah's sanctuary and dwelling-place for the reason that it represented the realities mentioned above.  </p>

`Secundum omne quod Ego monstro tibi, formam habitaculi': quod significet repraesentativum caeli ubi Dominus, constat ex significatione `formae habitaculi' quod sit repraesentativum caeli, forma enim 
est repraesentativum, et habitaculum est caelum; quod forma sit repraesentativum, est quia Divina in {1}caelis etiam sistuntur visibilia in forma; visibilia illa sunt repraesentativa; et quod habitaculum 
sit caelum ubi Dominus, videatur n. (x)8269, 8309. Qualia repraesentativa apparent in caelo, constat apud prophetas, {2} sicut apud Johannem in Apocalypsi, candelabra, i 12 seq., thronus cum viginti 
quattuor thronis circum illum, et quattuor animalia ante thronum, iv 2 seq., liber septem sigillis (x)obsignatus, v, equi exeuntes cum (x)aperirentur sigilla, vi, {3} angeli varie amicti cum phialis, 
ix, x, xv seq, equus albus, xix, et tandem Nova Hierosolyma, cujus muri, portae, fundamenta, altitudo, {4}latitudo, et longitudo describuntur, xxi, xxii; similia etiam apud alios prophetas. 	Omnia 
illa sunt repraesentativa, {5}qualia coram angelis continue 2 apparent in caelis, et sistunt in visibili forma Divina caelestia quae sunt boni amoris, et Divina spiritualia quae sunt boni fidei; talia 
in summa repraesentata {6}erant per tabernaculum, et per illa quae in tabernaculo, prout per ipsam arcam {7}, per mensam super qua panes, per {8}altare suffitus, per candelabrum, et per reliqua; quae 
quia formae erant Divinorum caelestium et spiritualium, ideo cum videbantur a populo, quando is in sancto cultu erat, tunc sistebantur in caelo talia quae repraesentabantur, quae, ut supra dictum, 
erant Divina caelestia quae sunt boni amoris in Dominum, et Divina spiritualia quae sunt boni fidei in Dominum; talem effectum in caelo habebant omnia repraesentativa illius Ecclesiae; sciendum est quod 
apud hominem semper spiritus et angeli sint, et quod homo absque illis non vivere possit; pariter quod per illos (t)sit nexus homini cum Domino, et quod sic subsistat humanum genus, et quoque caelum; 
inde constare potest ob quem finem repraesentativa, et quoque ritualia Ecclesiae apud gentem Israeliticam institutae, tum quoque ob quem finem Verbum, in quo omnia quae in sensu litterae, correspondent 
Divinis quae in caelo, ita in quo omnes res repraesentant, et omnes voces significant; inde {9} est nexus homini cum caelo, et per caelum cum Domino; absque quo nexu nulla prorsus ei vita foret, 
nam absque nexu cum Ipso Esse vitae, a Quo omne Existere vitae, nulli {10}est vita. 	Sed {11}haec non capiunt illi qui credunt quod vita {12}in ipso 3 homine sit, et quod homo {13} absque spiritibus 
et angelis vivat, ita absque influxu per caelum ex Divino; cum tamen omne inconnexum a Divino perit et nullum fit, et nihil usquam existere potest absque priore se, ita absque Divino, quod est {14}Primum, 
et {15}ipsum Esse (c)ex se seu Jehovah, proinde nec potest subsistere, nam subsistere est perpetuo existere. (s){16} Quia `habitaculum' significat caelum ubi Dominus, {17} etiam significat bonum 
amoris et fidei, {18}nam haec faciunt caelum {19}; et quia omne bonum est a Domino, et {20}caelum dicitur caelum (c)ex amore et {21}fide in Dominum,  {22}inde etiam habitaculum in supremo sensu significat 
Dominum, (d)ut {23}patet apud Esaiam lxiii 15; Jer. xxv 30; Ezech. xxxvii 26, 27; Ps. xxvi 8; Ps. xliii 3; Ps. xc 1; Ps. xci 9; Exod. xv 13; Deut. xii 5, (x)11; et alibi; inde constat quod tabernaculum
