<h3 align="center" class="ired">属天的奥秘 第5469节</h3>
<h4 align="center"></h4><p><strong>5469.</strong>“我们对我们兄弟实在有罪”表它们理应受到责备，因为它们不接受良善，从而疏远了内在。这从“有罪”的含义和“约瑟”的代表清楚可知：“有罪”是指应受责备，并且在归罪之下，因为良善与真理被抛弃了（参看<a href="3400.htm">3400</a>节）；“约瑟”，即他们的“兄弟”（他们对他有罪）是指他们抛弃或疏远的内在。因为约瑟和便雅悯代表教会的内在，而雅各其余十个儿子代表教会的外在；事实上，约瑟和便雅悯的母亲“拉结”是对内层真理的情感，而“利亚”是对外层真理的情感（参看<a href="3758.htm">3758</a>，<a href="3782.htm">3782</a>，<a href="3793.htm">3793</a>，<a href="3819.htm">3819</a>节）。<br />在本章，“约瑟”代表属灵层的属天层，或源于神性的真理，也就是内在；“便雅悯”代表属天层的属灵层，也就是从内在发出的居间层；雅各其余“十个儿子”代表外在教会的真理，因而代表属世层中的真理，如前面频繁所述。本章还论述了教会内在与教会外在的联结，无论总体还是细节；因为每个人要成为总体教会的一部分，必须成为一个个体教会。但就至高意义而言，所论述的主题是主，即祂如何在其人身里面将内在与外在联结起来，以便祂能使这人身变成神性。</p>

We are surely guilty concerning our brother. That this signifies that they are to blame because they have alienated the internal by non-reception of good, is evident from the signification of "being 
guilty," as being to be at fault and under the imputation of rejection of good and truth (see n. 3400); and from the representation of Joseph, who is the "brother concerning whom they were guilty," as 
being the internal they had rejected or alienated. For by Joseph and Benjamin is represented the internal of the church, but by the other ten sons of Jacob its external; for Rachel, who was the mother 
of Joseph and Benjamin, is the affection of interior truth, and Leah is the affection of exterior truth (see n. 3758, 3782, 3793, 3819). In this chapter, by Joseph is represented the celestial of the 
spiritual, or truth from the Divine, which is the internal; by Benjamin the spiritual of the celestial, which is the intermediate proceeding thence, and by the other ten sons of Jacob the truths of 
the external church, thus truths in the natural (as often said above). This chapter treats also of the conjunction of the internal of the church with its external in general and in particular; for every 
man must be a church in particular in order to be a part of the general church. But in the supreme sense the subject treated of is the Lord, how he united the internal with the external in His Human, 
that He might make it Divine. </p>

'Assuredly we are guilty concerning our brother' means that they were blameworthy because they had alienated the internal by their non-acceptance of good. This is clear from the meaning of 'being guilty' 
as being blameworthy and subject to the imputation [of sin] because good and truth have been cast aside, dealt with in <a href="3400.htm">3400</a>; and from the representation of Joseph, 'their brother' concerning whom 
they were guilty, as the internal which they had cast aside or alienated. For Joseph and Benjamin represent the internal aspect of the Church, while the remaining ten sons of Jacob represent its external 
aspect - 'Rachel', from whom Joseph and Benjamin were born, being the affection for interior truth, and 'Leah' the affection for exterior truth, <a href="3758.htm">3758</a>, <a href="3782.htm">3782</a>, <a href="3793.htm">3793</a>, <a href="3819.htm">3819</a>. </p>
<p></p>
<p><b>[2]</b>
 In this chapter 'Joseph' 
represents the celestial of the spiritual or truth from the Divine, which is the internal; 'Benjamin' represents the spiritual of the celestial, which is the intermediary going forth from the internal; 
and the remaining 'ten sons of Jacob' represent the truths known to the external Church and so truths that are present in the natural, as stated many times above. This chapter also deals with 
the joining of the internal aspect of the Church to its external aspect, corporately and in every specific part; for each person individually must be a Church if he is to form part of the Church as a 
corporate whole. But in the highest sense the chapter deals with the way in which the Lord united the Internal to the External within His Human so as to make this Divine. </p>

`Profecto rei sumus nos super fratrem nostrum': quod significet quod in culpa sint quia abalienaverunt internum per non receptionem boni, constat ex significatione `{1}reus esse' quod sit in culpa esse, 
et in imputatione propter rejectionem boni et veri, de qua n. 3400; et ex repraesentatione `Josephi' qui hic est frater super quem rei, quod sit internum quod rejecerunt seu abalienaverunt; per `Josephum' 
enim et `Benjaminem' repraesentatur internum Ecclesiae, at per `decem reliquos filios Jacobi' externum ejus; `Rachel' enim, ex qua Josephus et Benjamin, est affectio veri interioris, et `Leah' 
affectio veri exterioris, n. 3758, 3782, 3793, 3819; [2]in hoc capite per `Josephum' repraesentatur caeleste spiritualis seu verum a Divino quod est internum, per `Benjamin' spirituale caelestis quod 
est medium procedens inde, et per `decem filios Jacobi reliquos' repraesentantur vera Ecclesiae externae, ita in naturali, ut pluries supra dictum; agitur etiam de conjunctione interni Ecclesiae cum 
externo ejus in communi et {2} particulari, unusquisque enim homo erit Ecclesia in particulari ut sit pars Ecclesiae communis; in supremo autem sensu agitur de Domino quomodo Ipse univerat Internum 
cum Externo in Humano Suo ut id Divinum faceret. @1 rei$  @2 i in $ </p>
