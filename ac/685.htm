<h3 align="center" class="ired">属天的奥秘 第685节</h3>
<h4 align="center"></h4><p>685．在来生（灵界），有许多奇妙的组合，好比世上的关系，也就是说，他们视彼此为父母、子女、兄弟和血缘、姻亲关系。他们对彼此的爱，取决于这类关系的差异。这些差异无穷无尽，并且可传送的感知如此精妙，以至于无法描述。这些关系根本不牵涉他们在世时的情况，无论那时他们是父母、子女，抑或血缘和姻亲关系。他们根本不关心人曾经的社会地位如何，因此根本不关心他的荣誉地位或财富，诸如此类，而唯独关心相爱和信的各种体现，以及接受能力。这种接受能力是他们在世时从主那里获得的。</p>

<p><strong>[NCE]685.</strong> The ties that connect people in the next life are remarkable. They are like family ties on earth, in that some acknowledge others as parents, as children, as siblings, as blood relatives, and as more distant connections. Their love for one another reflects these different levels of relationship. The varieties come in unlimited number. The way they are communicated and perceived is so exquisite that it cannot be described.<br />People there pay no attention at all to who was whose parent, child, blood relative, or connection on earth. They do not care what a person's outer identity was like, whether the individual had importance or wealth, and so on. They look only at differences in mutual love and in faith, and at what kind of capacity for welcoming love and faith a person has received from the Lord while living in the world. </p>
<p align="center"><b>Potts(1905-1910) 685</b></p><p><b>685.</b>
There are wonderful consociations in the other life which may be compared to relationships on earth: that is to say, they recognize one another as parents, children, brothers, and relations by blood 
and by marriage, the love being according to such varieties of relationship. These varieties are endless, and the communicable perceptions are so exquisite that they cannot be described. The relationships 
have no reference at all to the circumstance that those who are there had been parents, children, or kindred by blood and marriage on earth; and they have no respect to person, no matter what anyone 
may have been. Thus they have no regard to dignities, nor to wealth, nor to any such matters, but solely to varieties of mutual love and of faith, the faculty for the reception of which they had received 
from the Lord while they had lived in the world. </p>

<p align="center"><b>Elliott(1983-1999) 685</b></p><p><b>685.</b>
Marvellous ties exist between people in the next life. They are comparable to family relationships on earth, that is to say, they accept one another as parents, children, brothers, blood relatives, and 
relatives by marriage, their love for one another according with such differences. These differences are limitless, and the perceptions communicable are so excellent as to defy description. No thought 
at all is given to what they once were on earth - parents, children, blood relatives, or relatives by marriage. Nor is any thought given at all to what a person's social position has been, no matter 
who - to his positions of honour, or his wealth, and so on - only to the varying embodiments of mutual love and faith; and the ability to receive these they acquired from the Lord while they were in 
the world. </p>

<p align="center"><b>Latin(1748-1756) 685</b>
</p><b>685.</b>
Consociationes mirabiles sunt in altera vita; se habent comparative sicut affinitates in terris, nempe quod agnoscantur sicut parentes, sicut liberi, sicut fratres, sicut consanguinei, sicut affines; 
secundum tales differentias est amor; differentiae sunt indefinitae, perceptiones communicativae ita exquisitae ut non describi possint; nullo prorsus respectu habito ad parentes, liberos, consanguineos 
et affines in terra, nec ad aliquam personam qualiscumque fuit, ita non ad dignitates, non ad divitias, et similia, sed solum ad amoris mutui et fidei differentias, quarum recipiendarum facultatem 
acceperunt a Domino cum vixerunt in mundo. </p>
