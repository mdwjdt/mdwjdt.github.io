<p><strong>[NCE]1360.</strong> These are the births of Terah symbolizes the origins of and various developments in the idolatry from which the representative church arose. The symbolism of births as origins and developments was demonstrated earlier in this chapter, at verse <a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_1360/bible_king-james-version_genesis_11_10" target=_top>10</a> [<a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_1360/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_1330" target=_top>1330</a>]. The object of discussion at this point is the third church that came after the Flood. This church arose when the second one (described from verse <a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_1360/bible_king-james-version_genesis_11_10" target=_top>10</a> up to here) turned idolatrous with Terah. It has been shown that Terah, Abram, Nahor, and Haran were idolaters, not to mention the nations that came from them, such as the Ishmaelites, Midianites, and others of Abram's descendants.{*1} In addition there were Nahor's descendants in Syria, and also the Moabites and Ammonites, who were offspring of Lot.<br /><br /><strong>Footnotes:</strong><br />{*1} On the Ishmaelites, see <a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_1360/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_1358" target=_top>1358</a> and note 1 in <a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_1360/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_1358" target=_top>1358</a> just above.

And these are the births of Terah. This signifies the origins and derivations of the idolatry from which came the representative church. It has been shown above (at verse 10 of this chapter) that "births" 
signify origins and derivations. Here now the Third Church after the flood is treated of, which succeeded when the second-treated of from verse 10 to this-became idolatrous in Terah. It has been 
shown that Terah, Abram, Nahor, and Haran were idolaters, as well as the nations derived from them, as the Ishmaelites and Midianites, and others who were descendants of Abram; besides others in Syria 
that were derived from Nahor; and also the Moabites and Ammonites, who were descendants of Lot. </p>

That 'these are the generations of Terah' means the origins and derivatives of idolatry, from which a representative Church emerged, [is clear from what has just been said.]<A name="fntext1"></a><A href="#fn1"><sup>a</sup></a> That 'generations' means 
origins and derivatives has been shown above at verse 10 of this chapter. The present verse deals with the third Church after the Flood which took the place of the second, when that second one, dealt 
with from verse 10 down to this point, came to be idolatrous in Terah. It has been shown already that Terah, Abram, Nahor, and Haran were idolaters, as well as that nations were descended from them, 
such as the Ishmaelites, the Midianites, and others who were descendants of Abram, not to mention others in Syria descended from Nahor, and also the Moabites and Ammonites who were the descendants of 
Lot.
