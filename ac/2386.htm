Verse 12. And the men said unto Lot, Hast thou yet anyone here? Son-in-law, and thy sons, and thy daughters, and whomsoever thou hast in the city, bring them out of the place. "And the men said unto 
Lot," signifies that the Lord admonishes those who are in the good of charity; "hast thou yet anyone here? Son-in-law, and thy sons, and thy daughters, and whomsoever thou hast in the city, bring them 
out of the place," signifies that all who are in the good of charity, and that all things belonging thereto, would be saved, and also those who are in the truth of faith, provided they would recede from 
evil; "sons-in-law," are the truths that are associated with the affections of good; here, that were to be associated; "sons," are truths; "daughters," affections of good and of truth; "whomsoever 
thou hast in the city," denotes whatever derives anything from truth; the "place," is the state of evil. </p>

<p align="center"><b>Elliott(1983-1999) 2386</b></p><p><b>2386.</b>
Verse 12 And the men said to Lot, Whom have you here still? Son-in-law, and your sons, and your daughters, and everyone you have in the city - bring [them] out of the place. </p>
<p>'The men said to Lot' 
means that the Lord warns those with whom the good of charity is present. 'Whom have you here still? Son-in-law, and your sons, and your daughters, and everyone you have in the city - bring [them] out 
of the place' means that all with whom the good of charity exists, and everything belonging to that good, were to be saved; also those governed by the truth of faith, provided they drew back from evil 
- 'sons-in-law' meaning truths coupled to affections for good [and truth], here truths that have yet to be coupled; 'sons' meaning truths; 'daughters' meaning affections for good and truth; 'everyone 
you have in the city' meaning whatever derives anything from truth; 'place' meaning a state of evil. </p>

Vers. 12.  Et dixerunt viri ad Lotum, Adhuc quis tibi hic? generum, et filios tuos, et filias tuas, et omnem qui tibi in urbe, educ e loco. `Dixerunt viri ad Lotum' significat quod Dominus advertat 
eos qui in bono charitatis sunt: `adhuc quis tibi hic? generum, et filios tuos, et filias tuas, et omnem qui tibi in urbe, educ e loco' significat quod omnes qui in bono charitatis, et omnia quae ejus, 
salvarentur, etiam qui in vero fidei, si a malo recederent; `generi' sunt vera associata affectionibus boni, hic associanda; `filii' sunt vera; `filiae' affectiones boni et veri; `omnis qui in urbe' 
est quicquid trahit aliquid de vero; `locus' est status mali. </p>
