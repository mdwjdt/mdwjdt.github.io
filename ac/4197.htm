<h3 align="center" class="ired">属天的奥秘 第4197节</h3>
<h4 align="center"></h4><p><strong>4197.</strong>“拉班说，今日这石堆作你我中间的证据。因此给它起名叫迦累得”表它将永远如此，因此它的性质又一次被描述。这从“堆”、“证据”、“今日”和“起名”的含义清楚可知：“堆”是指良善（参看<a href="4192.htm">4192</a>节）；“证据”是指通过真理对良善的确认，如下文述；“今日”是指永恒（<a href="2838.htm">2838</a>，<a href="3998.htm">3998</a>节）；“起名”是指基本性质（<a href="144.htm">144</a>，<a href="145.htm">145</a>，<a href="1754.htm">1754</a>，<a href="2009.htm">2009</a>，<a href="2724.htm">2724</a>，<a href="3421.htm">3421</a>节）。那良善的具体就包含在“迦累得”这个名字中；因为在古时，当某个事物取名时，这个名字就包含该事物的基本性质（<a href="340.htm">340</a>，<a href="1946.htm">1946</a>，<a href="2643.htm">2643</a>，<a href="3422.htm">3422</a>节）。由此可见“拉班说，今日这石堆作你我中间的证据。因此给它起名叫迦累得”表示什么，即表示此处“拉班”所表良善与主之属世层的神性良善结合、因而主与外邦人通过良善结合的证据；因为该良善就是“拉班”现在所代表的（<a href="4189.htm">4189</a>节）。属于该良善的真理就是为那结合作见证的；然而，只要他们活在世上，他们的良善就在边上，因为他们没有神性真理。尽管那些处于该良善，也就是过着彼此仁爱生活的人没有直接来自神性源头，也就是来自圣言的神性真理，但他们所拥有的良善并没有被关闭，而是能被打开的那种。而且在来世，当他们接受有关信之真理和主的教导时，它就被打开。基督徒则不然。对他们当中那些过着彼此仁爱的生活之人，尤其那些处于对主之爱的人来说，甚至在他们活在世上时，直接来自神性源头的良善就存在，因为他们拥有神性真理。因此，他们无需这类教导就可进入天堂，只要他们的真理不含必须先被驱散的虚假。但那些没有过着仁爱生活的基督徒则向自己关闭天堂，并且他们当中许多人关闭到它无法被打开的地步。因为他们知道真理，却否认它们，即便不在口头上，也在心里强硬反对它们。<br />拉班先以自己的语言将这堆称为“伊迦尔撒哈杜他”，之后以迦南的语言，这堆名为“迦累得”；而事实上，这二者意思差不多，这是为了聚在一起并由此结合的缘故。以迦南的语言说话，或说“迦南的方言”表示回应神性；因为“迦南”表示主的国度，在至高意义上表示主（<a href="1607.htm">1607</a>，<a href="3038.htm">3038</a>，<a href="3705.htm">3705</a>节）；这一点明显可见于以赛亚书：<br />当那日，埃及地必有五座城说迦南的方言，又指着万军之耶和华起誓。当那日，在埃及地中央必有为耶和华筑的一座坛；在埃及的边界上必有为耶和华立的一根柱。这都要在埃及地为万军之耶和华作记号和证据。（以赛亚书<a href="http://39-27.cn/赛19.18.htm">19:18</a>-<a href="http://39-27.cn/赛19.20.htm">20</a>）<br />“见证或证据”（witness）表示通过真理对良善，以及对源于良善的真理的确认；因此，“证词或法版”（testimony）表示真理植根于其中的良善，和良善所产生的真理，这一点从圣言的其它经文可以看出来。“证据”表示通过真理对良善，以及对源于良善的真理的确认，这一点从以下经文明显看出来。约书亚记：<br />约书亚对百姓说，你们选定耶和华，要事奉祂，你们自己作见证吧！他们说，我们就是见证。你们现在要除掉你们中间的外邦神，专心归向耶和华以色列的神。百姓对约书亚说，我们必事奉耶和华我们的神，听从祂的声音。当日，约书亚就与百姓立约，在示剑为他们立定律例典章。约书亚将这些话都写在神的律法书上，又将一块大石头立在耶和华圣所旁边的橡树下。约书亚对众民说，看哪！这石头可以向我们作见证，因为是听见了耶和华所吩咐我们的一切话，所以要向你们作见证，免得你们背弃耶和华你们的神。（约书亚记<a href="http://39-27.cn/书24.22.htm">24:22</a>-<a href="http://39-27.cn/书24.27.htm">27</a>）<br />“见证”在此明显表示确认，就是对约、因而对他们与耶和华结合的确认；因为“约”表示结合（<a href="665.htm">665</a>，<a href="666.htm">666</a>，<a href="1023.htm">1023</a>，<a href="1038.htm">1038</a>，<a href="1864.htm">1864</a>，<a href="1996.htm">1996</a>，<a href="2003.htm">2003</a>，<a href="2021.htm">2021</a>节）。由于若非通过良善，与耶和华或主结合是不可能的；而良善若不从真理获得其真正性质，就不可能产生结合，故可知，“见证”表示通过真理对良善的确认。此处所表良善是指与耶和华或主的结合，这种结合通过他们选定祂，要事奉祂而实现；作出确认的真理以“石头”来表示；因为“石头”表示真理（<a href="643.htm">643</a>，<a href="1298.htm">1298</a>，<a href="3720.htm">3720</a>节）。就至高意义而言，“石头”是指主自己，因为祂是一切真理的源头，祂因此被称作“以色列的磐石”（创世记<a href="http://39-27.cn/创49.24.htm">49:24</a>）；经上还说“看哪！这石头可以向我们作见证，因为是听见了耶和华所吩咐我们的一切话。”<br />启示录：<br />我要使我那两个见证人，穿着麻布，说预言一千二百六十天。这二人就是那两棵橄榄树，两个灯台，立在大地之神面前的。若有人想要害他们，就有火从他们口中出来，烧灭仇敌；这二人有权柄叫天闭塞。他们作完见证的时候，那从无底坑里上来的兽必与他们交战，并且战胜他们，把他们杀了。过了这三天半，有生命的灵气从神那里进入他们里面，他们就立足站了起来。（启示录<a href="http://39-27.cn/启11.3.htm">11:3</a>-<a href="http://39-27.cn/启11.7.htm">7</a>，<a href="http://39-27.cn/启11.11.htm">11</a>）<br />此处所提到的“两个见证人”是指良善与真理，也就是有真理在其中的良善和由良善所产生的真理，这二者在人心里得到确认；这一点从经上说这两个见证人是两棵橄榄树和两个灯台明显看出来。因为“一棵橄榄树”是指这种良善（参看<a href="886.htm">886</a>节）；“两棵橄榄树”表示属天良善和属灵良善。属天良善本质上是对主之爱，属灵良善本质上是对邻之仁。“灯台”是指属于这两种良善的真理，蒙主的神性怜悯，这一点等到论述灯台时就会清楚可知。正是这些良善与真理拥有关闭或打开天堂的权柄（参看22章序言）。“从无底坑（即地狱）里上来的兽必把他们杀了”表示教会内良善与真理的荒废；“有生命的灵气从神那里进入他们里面，他们就立足站了起来”表示一个新教会。<br />由于在古时，堆用作证据，所以后来的祭坛也用作证据，这一点明显可见于约书亚记：<br />流便人、迦得人说，你们看我们列祖所筑的耶和华坛的样式，这并不是为献燔祭，也不是为献别的祭，乃是为作你我中间的证据。流便人、迦得人给坛起名叫证坛，在我们中间证明耶和华是神。（约书亚记<a href="http://39-27.cn/书22.28.htm">22:28</a>，<a href="http://39-27.cn/书22.34.htm">34</a>）<br />“坛”表示爱之良善，在至高意义上表示主自己（<a href="921.htm">921</a>，<a href="2777.htm">2777</a>，<a href="2811.htm">2811</a>节）。“证明”（witness）表示通过真理对良善的确认。<br />由于“见证”（witness，或译证据、证明）表示通过真理对良善，以及对源于良善的真理的确认，故就至高意义而言，“见证”（witness，或译证据、证明）表示主，因为主就是那作出确认的神性真理，如以赛亚书：<br />我必与你们立永约，就是应许大卫那可靠的恩典；看哪，我已立祂作万民的见证，为万民的君王和司令。（以赛亚书<a href="http://39-27.cn/赛55.3.htm">55:3</a>，<a href="http://39-27.cn/赛55.4.htm">4</a>）<br />启示录：<br />并那诚实作见证的，从死里首先复活，为地上诸王元首的耶稣基督来的。（启示录<a href="http://39-27.cn/启1.5.htm">1:5</a>）<br /><br />这些事是那为诚信真实见证的，神工之初始的说的。（启示录<a href="http://39-27.cn/启3.14.htm">3:14</a>）<br />在代表性教会有这样的要求：真理必须建立在两三个证人，而不是一个证人的证词上（民数记<a href="http://39-27.cn/民35.30.htm">35:30</a>；申命记<a href="http://39-27.cn/申17.6.htm">17:6</a>，<a href="http://39-27.cn/申17.7.htm">7</a>；<a href="http://39-27.cn/申19.15.htm">19:15</a>；马太福音<a href="http://39-27.cn/太18.16.htm">18:16</a>）；这个要求源于以下神性律法：良善不是由一个真理，而是由许多真理来确认的。因为与其它无关的一个真理不能确认它，只有许多真理才能，因为从一个真理可以看到另一个真理。单独一个不能赋予良善任何形式，因而不会显明良善所拥有的任何基本品质，但以一个系列联系起来的许多个则能。因为正如一个音符不能产生任何旋律，更不用说完全的和谐了，一个真理同样不能成就任何事。这就是要求有两三个证人的律法来源之处，尽管从表面上看，它似乎来源于世俗的法律。然而，一个不会违背另一个，这一点也是十诫的情形，如前所述（<a href="2609.htm">2609</a>节）。<br />“证词或法版”（testimony）表示真理植根于其中的良善，和良善所产生的真理，这一点从刚才所述可推知，也可从以下事实清楚看出来：写在两块石版上的十诫是以一个词，即“证词”来称呼的，如摩西五经：<br />耶和华在西乃山和摩西说完了话，就把两块法版（two tables of the testimony）交给他，是神用指头写的石版。（出埃及记<a href="http://39-27.cn/出31.18.htm">31:18</a>）<br /><br />摩西下山，手里拿着两块法版，这版是两面写的。（出埃及记<a href="http://39-27.cn/出32.15.htm">32:15</a>）<br />由于两块法版被放在柜里，故这柜被称为“约柜”，如摩西五经：<br />耶和华对摩西说，你必将把我所要赐给你的法版放在柜里。（出埃及记<a href="http://39-27.cn/出25.16.htm">25:16</a>，<a href="http://39-27.cn/出25.21.htm">21</a>）<br />摩西又取了法版放在柜里。（出埃及记<a href="http://39-27.cn/出40.20.htm">40:20</a>）<br /><br />我要与你相会，又要从法柜二基路伯中间的施恩座上，和你说。（出埃及记<a href="http://39-27.cn/出25.22.htm">25:22</a>）<br />利未记：<br />使香的烟云遮掩法柜上的施恩座。（利未记<a href="http://39-27.cn/利16.13.htm">16:13</a>）.<br />民数记：<br />你要把这十二根杖存在会幕内法柜前。（民数记<a href="http://39-27.cn/民17.4.htm">17:4</a>）<br />这柜由此也被称作“法柜”（还可参看出埃及记<a href="http://39-27.cn/出25.22.htm">25:22</a>；<a href="http://39-27.cn/出31.7.htm">31:7</a>；启示录<a href="http://39-27.cn/启15.5.htm">15:5</a>）。<br />故十诫被称为“法版”（testimony），因为它们是立约的条件，因而主与人彼此结合的条件。这种彼此结合是不可能的，除非人遵守这些诫命，不仅外在形式上遵守，内在也要遵守。至于这些诫命的内在形式是什么，可参看前文（<a href="2609.htm">2609</a>节）；所以，这就是“法版”（testimony，或译证词）所表示的通过真理所确认的良善，和源于良善的真理。正因如此，这两块石版也被称作“约版”；柜被称作“约柜”。由此可见在圣言中，“法版”的真正意义是什么（如申命记<a href="http://39-27.cn/申4.45.htm">4:45</a>；<a href="http://39-27.cn/申6.17.htm">6:17</a>，<a href="http://39-27.cn/申6.20.htm">20</a>；以赛亚书<a href="http://39-27.cn/赛8.16.htm">8:16</a>；列王记下<a href="http://39-27.cn/王下17.15.htm">17:15</a>；诗篇<a

<p align="center"><b>Potts(1905-1910) 4197</b></p><p><b>4197.</b>
And Laban said, This heap is a witness between me and thee this day; therefore he called the name of it Galeed. That this signifies that it will be so to eternity, hence its quality again, is evident 
from the signification of a "heap," as being good (see n. 4192); and from the signification of a "witness," as being the confirmation of good by truth (concerning which below); from the signification 
of "this day," as being eternity (n. 2838, 3998); and from the signification of "calling a name," as being the quality (n. 144, 145, 1754, 2009, 2724, 3421). The quality itself is contained in the name 
"Galeed;" for in ancient times the names imposed contained the quality (n. 340, 1946, 2643, 3422). From this it is manifest what is signified by, "Laban said, This heap is a witness between me and 
thee this day; therefore he called the name of it Galeed," namely, a testification of the conjunction of the good here signified by "Laban" with the good Divine of the Lord's natural, consequently the 
conjunction of the Lord with the Gentiles by good; for this good is what is now represented by Laban (n. 4189). The truths of this good are what testify of the conjunction; and yet so long as they live 
in the world their good is aside, because they have not truths Divine. But they who live in this good (that is, in mutual charity), although they have no truths Divine direct from the Divine fountain 
(that is, from the Word), they nevertheless have not their good closed up, but such that it can be opened; and it also is opened in the other life, when they are there instructed in the truths of faith, 
and concerning the Lord.  It is otherwise with Christians, of whom those who are in mutual charity, and still more those who are in love to the Lord, are in direct good while living in the world, 
because they are in truths Divine; and therefore they enter into heaven without such instruction, provided there have not been in their truths falsities, which must first be dispelled. But those Christians 
who have not lived in charity have closed heaven against themselves, and very many of them to such a degree that it cannot be opened; for they know truths, and deny them, and also harden themselves 
against them, if not with the mouth, yet in the heart. [2] Laban's first calling the heap "Jegar-sahadutha" in his own idiom, and then "Galeed" in the idiom of Canaan, when both have nearly the 
same meaning, is for the sake of the application, and of the conjunction thereby. To speak in the idiom of Canaan, or "with the lip of Canaan," is to apply one's self to the Divine; for by "Canaan" is 
signified the Lord's kingdom, and in the supreme sense the Lord (n. 1607, 3038, 3705); as is manifest in Isaiah: </p>
<p>     In that day there shall be five cities in the land of Egypt that speak with the 
lips of Canaan, and that swear to Jehovah Zebaoth. In that day shall there be an altar to Jehovah in the midst of the land of Egypt, and a pillar at the border thereof to Jehovah. And it shall be for 
a sign and for a witness to Jehovah Zebaoth in the land of Egypt (Isa. 19:18-20). [3] That a "witness" denotes the confirmation of good by truth, and of truth by good, and that hence a "testimony" denotes 
the good from which is truth, and the truth which is from good, may be seen from the Word in other passages. That a "witness" denotes the confirmation of good by truth and of truth by good, is evident 
from the following passages. In Joshua: </p>
<p>     Joshua said unto the people, Ye are witnesses against yourselves, that ye have chosen Jehovah to serve Him. And they said, We are witnesses. Now therefore 
put away the strange gods which are in the midst of you, and incline your heart unto Jehovah the God of Israel. And the people said unto Joshua, Jehovah our God will we serve, and unto His voice 
will we be obedient. And Joshua made a covenant with the people that day, and set them a statute and a judgment in Shechem. And Joshua wrote these words in the book of the law of God; and he took a 
great stone, and set it up there under an oak that was in the sanctuary of Jehovah. And Joshua said unto all the people, Behold, this stone shall be for a witness to us, for it hath heard all the words 
of Jehovah which He spake unto us; and it shall be to you for a witness, lest ye deny your God (Josh. 24:22-27); </p>
<p>that a "witness" here is confirmation, is manifest, and indeed the confirmation of 
a covenant, and accordingly of conjunction; for a "covenant" signifies conjunction (n. 665, 666, 1023, 1038, 1864, 1996, 2003, 2021). And as conjunction with Jehovah or the Lord is not possible except 
by good; nor the good which conjoins except that which has its quality from truth; it follows that a "witness" denotes the confirmation of good by truth. The good here meant is conjunction with Jehovah 
or the Lord by their choosing Him to serve Him; the truth by which the confirmation was made being the "stone." (That a "stone" denotes truth may be seen above, n. 643, 1298, 3720.) In the supreme 
sense, the "stone" is the Lord Himself, because all truth is from Him, and therefore He is called the "Stone of Israel" (Gen. 49:24); and it is also said, "Behold, this stone shall be for a witness to 
us, for it hath heard all the words of Jehovah which He spake unto us." [4] In John: </p>
<p>     I will give unto my two witnesses, that they shall prophesy a thousand two hundred and sixty days, clothed 
in sackcloth. These are the two olive-trees and the two lampstands that stand before the God of the earth. And if any man desire to hurt them, fire proceedeth out of their mouth, and devoureth their enemies; 
these have power to shut heaven. And when they shall have finished their testimony, the beast that cometh up out of the abyss shall make war with them, and shall overcome them, and shall kill 
them. And after three days and a half, the breath of life from God entered into them, so that they stood upon their feet (Rev. 11:3-7, 11); </p>
<p>that the "two witnesses" here mentioned are good and truth 
(that is, the good in which is truth, and the truth which is from good), both confirmed in hearts, is manifest from its being said that the two witnesses are the two olive-trees and the two lampstands. 
(That an "olive-tree" is such good, may be seen above, n. 886.) The "two olive-trees" denote celestial good and spiritual good. Celestial good is that of love to the Lord, and spiritual good is that 
of charity toward the neighbor. The "lampstands" are the truths of these goods, as will appear when of the Lord's Divine mercy the subject of lampstands is treated of. That these goods and truths have 
power to shut heaven and to open heaven may be seen in the preface to the twenty-second chapter. That "the beast out of the abyss (that is, out of hell) will kill them," signifies the vastation of good 
and truth within the church; and that "the spirit of life from God entered into them, so that they stood upon their feet," signifies a new church. [5] That as in ancient times heaps were placed as 
witnesses, so afterwards were altars, is evident in Joshua: </p>
<p>     The Reubenites and the Gadites said, Behold the pattern of the altar of Jehovah which our fathers made, not for burnt-offering, and 
not for sacrifice; but it is a witness between us and you. And the sons of Reuben and the sons of Gad called the altar, A witness between us that Jehovah is God (Josh. 22:28, 34). (An "altar" is the 
good of love, and in the supreme sense the Lord Himself, n. 921, 2777, 2811.) In the internal sense a "witness" denotes the confirmation of good by truth. [6] As by a "witness" is signified the confirmation 
of good by truth and of truth by good, therefore in the supreme sense by a "witness" is signified the Lord, because He is the Divine truth that confirms; as in Isaiah: </p>
<p>     I will make an everlasting 
covenant with you, even the true mercies of David; behold I have given Him for a Witness to the peoples, a prince and commander to the peoples (Isa. 55:4). In John: </p>
<p>     And from Jesus Christ, 
who is the faithful Witness, the firstborn from the dead, and the prince of the kings of the earth (Rev. 1:5). In the same: </p>
<p>     These things saith the faithful and true Witness, the beginning of 
the creation of God (Rev. 3:14). [7] The command given in the representative church, that all truth shall stand on the word of two or three witnesses, and not on that of one (Num. 35:30; Deut. 17:6, 
7; 19:15; Matt. 18:16), is founded on the Divine law that one truth does not confirm good, but a number of truths; for one truth without connection with others is not confirmatory, but a number together, 
because from one may be seen another. One does not produce any form, and thus not any quality, but only a number that are connected in a series. For as one tone does not produce any melody, still 
less harmony, so neither does one truth. These are the things on which the law in question is founded, although in the outward form it appears to be founded in the civic state; the one however is not 
contrary to the other, as is also the case with the precepts of the Decalogue, concerning which see above (n. 2609). [8] That a "testimony" denotes the good from which is truth, and the truth which 
is from good, follows from what has been said; and also from the fact that the ten precepts of the Decalogue written upon the tables of stone are called in one word the "testimony," as in Moses: </p>
<p>   
  Jehovah gave unto Moses, when He had made an end of speaking with him upon Mount Sinai, the two tables of the testimony, tables of stone, written with the finger of God (Exod. 31:18). In the same: </p>
<p> 
    Moses went down from the mount, and the two tables of the testimony were in his hand, tables that were written on their two sides (Exod. 32:15). And as the tables were placed in the ark, the ark 
is called the "ark of the testimony," as in Moses: </p>
<p>     Jehovah said to Moses, Thou shalt put into the ark the testimony which I shall give thee (Exod. 25:16, 21).      Moses took and put the testimony 
into the ark (Exod. 40:20). In the same: </p>
<p>     I will meet with thee, and I will speak with thee from above the mercy-seat from between the two cherubim which are upon the ark of the testimony 
(Exod. 25:22). In the same: </p>
<p>     That the cloud of incense may cover the mercy-seat, that is upon the testimony (Lev. 16:13). In the same: </p>
<p>     The rods of the twelve tribes were left in the tent 
of meeting before the testimony (Num. 17:4). (That from this the ark was also called the "ark of the testimony," see, besides the passage cited, Exod. 25:22; 31:7; Rev. 15:5.) [9] The precepts of the 
Decalogue were therefore called the "testimony," because they were of the covenant, thus of the conjunction between the Lord and man; which conjunction cannot come into existence unless man keeps the 
precepts, not only in external form, but also in internal. What the internal form of these precepts is, may be seen above (n. 2609); and therefore it is good confirmed by truth, and truth derived from 
good, which is signified by the "testimony." Because this is so, the tables were also called the "tables of the covenant;" and the ark, the "ark of the covenant." From all this it is manifest what 
in the genuine sense is signified in the Word by the "testimony" (as in Deut. 4:45; 6:17, 20; Isa. 8:16; 2 Kings 17:15; Ps. 19:7; 25:10; 78:5; 93:5; 119:2, 22, 24, 59, 79, 88, 138, 167; 122:3-4; Rev.

'And Laban said, This heap is a witness between me and you today; therefore he called its name Galeed' means that it will be so for ever - hence the nature of it is described a second time. This is clear 
from the meaning of 'a heap' as good, dealt with above in <a href="4192.htm">4192</a>, and from the meaning of 'a witness' as the confirmation of good by means of truth, and of truth derived from good, dealt with below; 
and from the meaning of 'today' as for ever, dealt with in <a href="2838.htm">2838</a>, <a href="3998.htm">3998</a>; and from the meaning of 'calling the name' as the essential nature, dealt with in <a href="144.htm">144</a>, <a href="145.htm">145</a>, <a href="1754.htm">1754</a>, <a href="2009.htm">2009</a>, <a href="2724.htm">2724</a>, <a href="3421.htm">3421</a>. The particular 
nature of that good is contained in the name Galeed; for in ancient times when a name was given to anything the name contained the essential nature of that thing, <a href="340.htm">340</a>, <a href="1946.htm">1946</a>, <a href="2643.htm">2643</a>, <a href="3422.htm">3422</a>. From this 
one may see what is meant by 'Laban said, This heap is a witness between me and you today; therefore he called its name Galeed', namely this: A testimony that the good meant here by 'Laban' was joined 
to the Divine good of the Lord's Natural, and therefore that the Lord was joined to the gentiles through good, it being this good that 'Laban' represents now, <a href="4189.htm">4189</a>. The truths belonging to this good 
are what bear witness to that conjunction; but as long as gentiles are living in this world their good is 'out of line' because they do not possess Divine truths. Nevertheless although those who are governed 
by that good, that is, who lead charitable lives with one another, do not have Divine truths straight from the Divine source, that is, from the Word, the good they have is not closed up but such 
as can be opened. What is more, it is opened in the next life when they receive instruction there in the truths of faith, and about the Lord. With Christians it is different. With those of them who 
lead charitable lives with one another, more so with those who are governed by love to the Lord, good straight from the Divine source is present even while they live in this world because they are in 
possession of Divine truths. For this reason they enter heaven without undergoing such instruction, provided that their truths have not contained falsities which must first be dispelled. But Christians 
who have not led charitable lives close heaven against themselves, very many doing so to such an extent that it cannot be opened. For they know truths but deny them and also harden themselves against 
them, if not with the lips nevertheless in their hearts. </p>

<p><b>[2]</b>
 Why Laban first of all called the heap Jegar Sahadutha, its name in his own language, and after that Galeed, its name in the Canaanite 
language, when in fact the two have practically the same meaning, is for the sake of a bringing together and thereby a joining together. Speaking in the language or 'lip' of Canaan means responding 
to what is Divine, for 'Canaan' means the Lord's kingdom, and in the highest sense the Lord, <a href="1607.htm">1607</a>, <a href="3038.htm">3038</a>, <a href="3705.htm">3705</a>, as is evident in Isaiah, </p>

speak in the lip of Canaan and swear by Jehovah Zebaoth. On that day there will be an altar to Jehovah in the midst of the land of Egypt, and a pillar to Jehovah at its border; and it will be for 
a sign and a witness to Jehovah Zebaoth in the land of Egypt. <a href="http://bible.gospelcom.net/cgi-bin/bible?passage=Isa%2019:18-20&amp;version=ESV&amp;interface=print&amp;showfn=yes&amp;showxref">Isa 19:18-20</a>.

<p><b>[3]</b>
 The meaning of 'a witness' as the confirmation of good by means of truth, and of truth derived from good, and the consequent 
meaning of 'a testimony' as good in which truth is rooted, and truth which arises out of good, may be seen from other parts of the Word. 'A witness' is seen to mean the confirmation of good by 
means of truth, and of truth derived from good, from the following places: In Joshua, </p>
<blockquote>
Joshua said to the people, You are witnesses against yourselves that you have chosen Jehovah, to serve Him. And 
they said, We are witnesses. Then put away the foreigner's gods which are in the midst of you, and incline your heart to Jehovah the God of Israel. And the people said to Joshua, Jehovah our God we 
will serve, and His voice we will obey. And Joshua made a covenant with the people on that day, and set them a statute and a judgement in Shechem. And Joshua wrote these words in the book of the law 
of God; and he took a great stone and set it up there under the oak that was in the sanctuary of Jehovah. And Joshua said to all the people, Behold, this stone will be a witness to us, for it has heard 
all the words of Jehovah which He spoke to us; and it will be a witness to you, lest you deny your God. <a href="http://bible.gospelcom.net/cgi-bin/bible?passage=Josh%2024:22-27&amp;version=ESV&amp;interface=print&amp;showfn=yes&amp;showxref">Josh 24:22-27</a>. 
</blockquote>
<p>'A witness' in this passage clearly means a confirming - a confirming of the 
covenant and therefore of their being joined [to Jehovah]; for a covenant means a joining together, <a href="665.htm">665</a>, <a href="666.htm">666</a>, <a href="1023.htm">1023</a>, <a href="1038.htm">1038</a>, <a href="1864.htm">1864</a>, <a href="1996.htm">1996</a>, <a href="2003.htm">2003</a>, <a href="2021.htm">2021</a>. And since being joined to Jehovah or the Lord is not 
possible except through good, and since no good effecting that conjunction is possible apart from that which gains its true nature from truth, 'a witness' consequently means the confirmation of good 
by means of truth. The good meant in this passage consisted in being joined to Jehovah or the Lord, which came about through their choosing Him, to serve Him; and the truth by which it was confirmed was 
meant by 'the stone'; for 'a stone' means truth, see <a href="643.htm">643</a>, <a href="1298.htm">1298</a>, <a href="3720.htm">3720</a>. In the highest sense 'the stone' is the Lord Himself since He is the source of all truth, and for that reason is also called 'the 
Stone of Israel' in <a href="http://bible.gospelcom.net/cgi-bin/bible?passage=Gen%2049:24&amp;version=ESV&amp;interface=print&amp;showfn=yes&amp;showxref">Gen 49:24</a>, and in what is said here in Joshua, 'Behold, this stone will be a witness to us, for it has heard all the words of Jehovah which He spoke to us'.  </p>

 In John, </p>
<p>I 
will grant My two witnesses to prophesy <a href="1260.htm">1260</a> days, clothed in sackcloth. The are the two olive trees and the two lampstands which are standing before the God of the earth. And if anyone wishes to harm 
them, fire will come out of their mouth and devour their enemies. These have power to shut heaven. But when they have finished their testimony, the beast that ascends from the abyss will make war 
with them and conquer them and kill them. But after three and a half days the spirit of life from God entered them, so that they stood up on their feet. <a href="http://bible.gospelcom.net/cgi-bin/bible?passage=Rev%2011:3-7,%2011&amp;version=ESV&amp;interface=print&amp;showfn=yes&amp;showxref">Rev 11:3-7, 11</a>. </p>
<p>'The two witnesses' in this 
case are good and truth - that is, good in which truth is present and truth arising out of good - when both of these have been confirmed in people's hearts, as is evident from the statement that the 
two witnesses are the two olive trees and the two lampstands. For 'an olive tree' means that kind of good, see <a href="886.htm">886</a>, and 'the two olive trees' stands for celestial good and for spiritual good. Celestial 
good is essentially love to the Lord, spiritual good is essentially charity towards the neighbour. 'The lampstands' are the truths that belong to those two kinds of good, as will be clear when, in the 
Lord's Divine mercy, the lampstands are the subject. And it is these - forms of goodness and truth - which have the power to close heaven or to open it; see the Preface to Chapter <a href="22.htm">22</a>. 'The beast out 
of the abyss, which is hell, will kill them' means the vastation of good and truth within the Church, and 'the spirit of life from God entered them, so that they stood up on their feet' means a new 
Church. </p>
<p></p>
<p><b>[5]</b>
 Just as heaps in ancient times were set up to serve as witnesses, so later on were altars, as is clear in Joshua, </p>
<blockquote>
The Reubenites and the Gadites said, See the replica of the altar of 
Jehovah which our fathers made, not for burnt offering or for sacrifice, but to be a witness between us and you. And the children of Reuben and the children of Gad called it The Altar - a witness between 
us that Jehovah is God. <a href="http://bible.gospelcom.net/cgi-bin/bible?passage=Josh%2022:28,%2034&amp;version=ESV&amp;interface=print&amp;showfn=yes&amp;showxref">Josh 22:28, 34</a>. 
</blockquote>
<p>'An altar' means the good of love, and in the highest sense the Lord Himself, <a href="921.htm">921</a>, <a href="2777.htm">2777</a>, <a href="2811.htm">2811</a>. 'A witness' stands in the internal sense for the confirmation 
of good by means of truth. </p>
<p></p>
<p><b>[6]</b>
 Since 'a witness' means the confirmation of good by means of truth, and of truth derived from good, 'a witness' in the highest sense therefore means the Lord, for 
He Himself is the Divine Truth that confirms, as in Isaiah, </p>
<blockquote>
I will make with you an eternal covenant, even the true mercies of David. Lo, I have given him as a witness to the peoples, a prince and 
teacher to the peoples. <a href="http://bible.gospelcom.net/cgi-bin/bible?passage=Isa%2055:3,%204&amp;version=ESV&amp;interface=print&amp;showfn=yes&amp;showxref">Isa 55:3, 4</a>.

<p><b>[7]</b>
 The requirement in the representative Church that the truth must always be established 
on the testimony of two or three witnesses, not on that of one, <a href="http://bible.gospelcom.net/cgi-bin/bible?passage=Num%2035:30&amp;version=ESV&amp;interface=print&amp;showfn=yes&amp;showxref">Num 35:30</a>; <a href="http://bible.gospelcom.net/cgi-bin/bible?passage=Deut%2017:6,%207;%2019:15&amp;version=ESV&amp;interface=print&amp;showfn=yes&amp;showxref">Deut 17:6, 7; 19:15</a>; <a href="http://bible.gospelcom.net/cgi-bin/bible?passage=Matt%2018:16&amp;version=ESV&amp;interface=print&amp;showfn=yes&amp;showxref">Matt 18:16</a>, originates in the Divine Law that one truth does not make good firm but many truths do so. 
For one truth unconnected to others does not confirm it only a number together, because from one truth it is possible to see another. One by itself does not give any form to good, and so does not manifest 
any essential quality possessed by good; but many in a connected series do so For just as one musical note by itself does not constitute the melody, still less the full harmony, neither does one 
truth achieve anything. This is where the law requiring two or three witnesses originates, though to outward appearance it seems to have its origin in secular legislation. The one however is not contrary 
to the other, as is also the case with the Ten Commandments, dealt with in <a href="2609.htm">2609</a>. </p>
<p></p>
<p><b>[8]</b>
 As regards 'a testimony' meaning good in which truth is rooted, and truth which arises out of good, this follows 
from what has just been said. It is also clear from the fact that the Ten Commandments written on tablets of stone are referred to by the single expression 'the Testimony', as in Moses, </p>
<blockquote>
Jehovah 
gave Moses, when He had finished speaking to him on Mount Sinai, the two tablets of the Testimony, tablets of stone, written with the finger of God. <a href="http://bible.gospelcom.net/cgi-bin/bible?passage=Exod%2031:18&amp;version=ESV&amp;interface=print&amp;showfn=yes&amp;showxref">Exod 31:18</a>. 
</blockquote>
<p>In the same author, </p>
<blockquote>
Moses came 
down from the mountain, and the two tablets of the Testimony were in his hand; the tablets were written from the two sides of it. <a href="http://bible.gospelcom.net/cgi-bin/bible?passage=Exod%2032:15&amp;version=ESV&amp;interface=print&amp;showfn=yes&amp;showxref">Exod 32:15</a>. 
</blockquote>
<p>And because those tablets were placed inside the Ark, 
the Ark is called 'the Ark of the Testimony'; in Moses, </p>
<blockquote>
Jehovah said to Moses, You shall put into the Ark the Testimony which I shall give to you. <a href="http://bible.gospelcom.net/cgi-bin/bible?passage=Exod%2025:16,%2021&amp;version=ESV&amp;interface=print&amp;showfn=yes&amp;showxref">Exod 25:16, 21</a>.

 The Ten Commandments 
therefore were called the Testimony because they were the conditions of the covenant and so the conditions whereby God and man were joined to each other. But that joining to each other is not 
possible unless man keeps those commandments not only in their external form but also in their internal. What the internal form of those commandments is, see <a href="2609.htm">2609</a>; consequently it is good made firm 
by means of truth, and truth derived from good, that are meant by 'the Testimony'. And this being so, the tablets were also called 'the Tablets of the Covenant', and the Ark 'the Ark of the Covenant'. 
From this one may now see what is meant in the Word by 'the Testimony' in the genuine sense, for example in <a href="http://bible.gospelcom.net/cgi-bin/bible?passage=Deut%204:45;%206:17,20&amp;version=ESV&amp;interface=print&amp;showfn=yes&amp;showxref">Deut 4:45; 6:17,20</a>; <a href="http://bible.gospelcom.net/cgi-bin/bible?passage=Isa%208:16;%202&amp;version=ESV&amp;interface=print&amp;showfn=yes&amp;showxref">Isa 8:16; 2</a> Kings 17:15; Ps. 19:7; 25:10; 78:5,<a href="56.htm">56</a>; 93:5; 119:2, <a href="22.htm">22</a>, <a href="24.htm">24</a>, <a href="59.htm">59</a>, <a href="79.htm">79</a>, <a href="88.htm">88</a>, <a href="138.htm">138</a>, <a href="167.htm">167</a>; 122:4; Rev. 6:9; 12:17; 19:10. </p>

et Gadditae, Videte figuram altaris      Jehovae, quod fecerunt patres nostri, non pro holocausto, et      non pro sacrificio, sed testis illud inter nos et inter      vos:... et vocarunt filii Reubenis 
et filii Gadis, Altare,      quod testis illud inter nos, quod Jehovah Deus, xxii 28, 34; </p>
<p>`altare' est bonum amoris, et in supremo sensu Ipse Dominus, n. 921, 2777, 2811; `testis' pro confirmatione, 
in sensu interno, boni per verum.  [6] Quia per `testem' significatur confirmatio boni per verum ac veri a bono, ideo per `testem' in supremo sensu significatur Dominus, quia Ipse est Divinum 
Verum confirmans, ut apud Esaiam,           Pangam vobis foedus aeternitatis, misericordias Davidis      veras, en testem populis dedi illum, principem et      praecipientem populis, lv [3,] 
4: </p>
<p>{7} apud Johannem,           Et a Jesu Christo, Qui est testis fidelis, primogenitus      ex mortuis, et princeps regum terrae, Apoc. i 5: </p>
<p>apud eundem,           Haec dicit testis fidelis et verus, 
principium      creaturae Dei Apoc. iii 14. [7]  Quod mandatum (o)sit in Ecclesia repraesentativa, quod `omne verum stabit super ore duorum aut trium testium, non super unius,' Num xxxv 30; 
Deut. xvii 6, 7; xix 15; Matth. xviii 16, fundatur in Lege Divina, quod unum verum non confirmet bonum sed plura vera: </p>
<p>{8} unum enim verum absque nexu cum aliis non est confirmans sed cum plura sunt, 
nam ex uno potest videri alterum; unum non parit aliquam formam, ita non aliquid quale, sed plura in serie connexa; </p>
<p>sicut enim unus tonus non {9} parit aliquem concentum, minus harmoniam, ita nec 
unum verum; haec sunt super quibus fundatur illa lex, tametsi in externa forma apparet fundata in statu civili, sed unum non est contra alterum; [8] sicut praecepta decalogi, de quibus n. 2609.  
Quod `testimonium' sit bonum a quo verum, et verum quod ex bono, sequitur inde, et quoque constat ex eo quod decem praecepta decalogi super tabulis lapideis scripta dicantur una voce Testimonium, ut 
apud Mosen,           Jehovah dedit Mosi, cum absolvisset loqui cum eo in      monte Sinai, duas tabulas Testimonii, tabulas lapidis,      scriptas digito Dei, Exod. xxxi 18: </p>
<p>apud eundem,      
     Descendit Moses e monte, et duae tabulae Testimonii in      manu ejus, tabulae scriptae a duobus lateribus ejus, [Exod.]      xxxii 15: </p>
<p>et quia tabulae illae in arca positae sunt, arca dicitur 
Arca Testimonii, de quo apud Mosen,           Jehovah ad Mosen, Dabis in Arcam Testimonium, quod dabo      tibi, Exod. xxv 16, 21: </p>
<p>          Moses accepit et dedit Testimonium in Arcam, Exod. xl 
20: </p>
<p>apud eundem,           Conveniam tibi, et loquar tecum desuper Propitiatorio  ab inter duos cherubos, qui super Arca Testimonii, Exod. xxv   22: </p>
<p>apud eundem,           Tegit nubes suffimenti 
Propitiatorium, quod super      Testimonio, Lev. xvi 13: </p>
<p>apud eundem,           Baculi duodecim tribuum relicti (o)sunt in Tentorio      conventus, coram Testimonio, Num. xvii 19 [A.V. 4]; </p>
<p>quod inde 
arca quoque dicta sit Arca Testimonii, praeter in loco citato Exod. xxv 22, videatur etiam Exod. xxxi 7; Apoc. xv 5; [9] praecepta decalogi ideo Testimonium dicta sunt quia erant foederis, ita 
conjunctionis inter Dominum et (o)inter hominem, quae conjunctio non existere potest nisi homo illa praecepta custodiat non solum in externa forma sed etiam in interna; quid interna forma illorum praeceptorum, 
videatur n. 2609, quapropter est bonum confirmatum per verum, et verum derivatum a bono, quod per `Testimonium' significatur; quia ita est, etiam tabulae dictae sunt Tabulae foederis, 
et arca Arca foederis.  Inde nunc patet quid per `Testimonium' in genuino sensu significatur in Verbo, ut Deut. iv 45; vi 17, 20; Esai. viii 16; 2 Reg. xvii 15; Ps. xix 8 [A.V. 7]; </p>
<p>xxv 10; lxxviii 
5, 56; xciii 5; cxix (x)2, (x)22, 24, 59, 79, 88, 138, 167; cxxii 4; Apoc. vi 9; xii 17; xix 10.      @1 Naturali$      @2 cum bono, in quo sunt gentes$      @3 ita$      @4 A d patet$      @5 i
