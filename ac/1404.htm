<h3 align="center" class="ired">属天的奥秘 第1404节</h3>
<h4 align="center"></h4><p><strong>1404.</strong>在包含真实历史的这些章节中，每一个词、每一句话在内义上都表示完全不同于字义上的事物。不过，这些历史细节本身具有代表性。首先论述的“亚伯兰”总体上代表主，具体代表属天之人；之后论述的“以撒”同样总体上代表主，具体代表属灵之人；“雅各”也总体上代表主，具体代表属世之人。他们就这样代表属于主、主的国度和教会之物。</p><br />

<p><strong>[NCE]1404.</strong> In these genuinely historical parts, every single statement and word symbolizes something radically different in the inner meaning than in the literal meaning, but the historical elements themselves are representative.<br />Abram, the first to be chronicled, broadly represents the Lord and more narrowly represents the heavenly self. Isaac, who comes next, likewise represents the Lord generally but the spiritual self{*1} specifically. Jacob too represents the Lord generally, and specifically he represents the earthly self. So the three of them represent properties of the Lord, of his kingdom, and of the church.<br /><br /><strong>Footnotes:</strong><br />{*1} The term "spiritual self" here should be understood to refer to the hierarchy of heavenly, spiritual, and earthly that is central to the order of heaven and the human psyche in Swedenborg's theology. On the heavenly and the spiritual in Swedenborg's works, see note 1 in 搂<a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_1404/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_30" target=_top>30</a>.

In these things now before us, which are true historicals, all the statements and words both in general and in particular have in the internal sense an entirely different signification from that which 
they bear in the sense of the letter; but the historicals themselves are representative. Abram, who is first treated of, represents in general the Lord, and specifically the celestial man; Isaac, who 
is afterwards treated of, in like manner represents in general the Lord, and specifically the spiritual man; Jacob also in general represents the Lord, and specifically the natural man. Thus they represent 
the things which are of the Lord, of His kingdom, and of the church. </p>

<p align="center"><b>Elliott(1983-1999) 1404</b></p><p><b>1404.</b>
In these chapters which contain true historical narratives every single word and statement means in the internal sense something altogether different from what is meant in the sense of the letter. Nevertheless 
the historical details themselves are representative. 'Abram', who is dealt with first, in general represents the Lord, and specifically the celestial man. 'Isaac', who is dealt with after 
that, likewise in general represents the Lord, and specifically the spiritual man; and Jacob' too in general represents the Lord, and specifically the natural man. Thus they represent things which are 
the Lord's, things which belong to His kingdom, and those which belong to the Church. </p>

<p align="center"><b>Latin(1748-1756) 1404</b>
</p><b>1404.</b>
In his quae historica vera sunt, omnia et singula dicta et verba significant in sensu interno prorsus alia quam in sensu litterae, sed ipsa historica sunt repraesentativa: 'Abramus' de quo primum agitur, 
repraesentat in genere Dominum, in specie caelestem hominem; 'Isacus' de quo postea, similiter in genere Dominum, in specie spiritualem hominem; 'Jacobus' quoque in genere Dominum, in specie naturalem 
hominem; ita illa quae sunt Domini, quae sunt regni Ipsius, et quae sunt Ecclesiae. </p>
