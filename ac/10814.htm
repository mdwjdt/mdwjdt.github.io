<h3 align="center" class="ired">属天的奥秘 第10814节</h3>
<h4 align="center"></h4><p><strong>10814</strong>.这时，我被与同我在一起的天使谈论各种统治。统治分为两种，一种是对邻之爱的统治，一种是自我之爱的统治。对邻之爱的统治存在于那些按各家各户各宗族分开居住的人当中；而自我之爱的统治则存在于那些住在一个社群里的人当中。在那些按各家各户各宗族分开居住的人当中，拥有统治权的，是宗族之父，他下面的各个家族之父，以及这些家族下面的各个家庭之父；“宗族之父”描述的是各个家族，以及出自这些家族的各个家庭所源自的那个人。但所有这些领袖都出于爱行使统治权，就像父亲对待自己的孩子一样；父亲会教导孩子当如何生活，向他们行善事，并尽可能地将自己所有的给予他们。他从来没有想过要把他们变成自己的臣民或家仆；相反，他喜欢他们像儿子顺从自己的父亲那样顺从他。由于众所周知，这爱随着下降而增长，所以宗族之父出于比儿子的亲生父亲更内在的爱行事。这种统治也存在于天堂中，因为这是属于主的一种统治。祂的统治出自祂对全人类的神性之爱。<br />但是，当人疏远主时，自我之爱的统治，就是对邻之爱的统治的对立面，就开始了；因为人们在何等程度上不热爱并敬拜主，就在何等程度上热爱并敬拜他们自己，也在同等程度上热爱世界，而不是天堂。这时，为了他们自己的安全，由各家各户组成的宗族就有必要聚成一体，建立各种形式的政府。因为这爱增长到何等程度，各种邪恶，如对一切反对他们之人的敌意、嫉妒、仇恨、报复、欺骗和残暴，就增长到何等程度。此外，这爱具有这样的性质，缰绳越放松，它就越向前冲，直到最后，凡被这爱主宰的人都想统治全世界所有人，人人都想占有他人的一切财富。事实上，它也不在那里停止；人人还都想统治整个天堂，这一点从现代的巴比伦可以看出来。这就是自我之爱的统治，而对邻之爱的统治就像天堂不同于地狱那样不同于自我之爱的统治。<br />不过，尽管自我之爱的统治在按社群生活的人当中具有这种性质，但对邻之爱的统治仍存在于王国里面，在那些出于对神的信和爱而变得智慧的人当中；因为这些人热爱邻舍。这些人在天堂也是分各家各户各宗族居住的，尽管他们在社群里一起生活；但他们是照着属灵的关系，也就是爱之良善和信之真理的关系如此生活的。蒙主的神性怜悯，这些人将在别处被提及。<br />10814a.下一章末尾我们将描述星空中的这第六颗星球。</p>

It was then given me to speak with the angels who were with me about rule of various kinds, and to say that there are two kinds of rule; one of love toward the neighbor, and the other of the love of 
self; and that the rule of love toward the neighbor prevails among those who dwell separated into houses, families, and nations; but the rule of the love of self among those who dwell together in a society. 
Among those who live separated into houses, families, and nations, it is the father of the nation, and under him the fathers of families, and under these the fathers of each household, who rule. 
He is called the father of the nation from whom come the families, and from the families the households. But all these rule from love like that of a father toward his children, who teaches them how 
they ought to live, bestows benefits upon them, and as far as he is able gives them of his own. Nor does it ever enter into his mind to subject them under himself as subjects or as servants; but he loves 
that they should obey him as sons obey their father. And as this love grows as it descends (as is known), therefore the father of the nation acts from a more interior love than the immediate father 
of the sons himself. Such also is the rule in the heavens, because such rule is of the Lord; for His rule is from His Divine love toward the whole human race.  </p>
<p>[2] But the rule of the love of self, 
which is opposite to the rule of love toward the neighbor, began when man estranged himself from the Lord; because insofar as a man does not love and worship the Lord, so far he loves and worships 
himself; and so far also he loves the world more than heaven. It then became a matter of necessity-for the sake of their safety-for the nations with their families and households to betake themselves 
into a united body, and to begin governments under various forms. For insofar as this love increased, so far increased evils of every kind, such as enmities, envyings, hatreds, revenges, deceits, and 
fierce ragings against all who opposed them. Moreover, this love is of such a nature that insofar as the reins are given it, it rushes on until at last all such persons wish to rule over all in the whole 
world, and everyone wishes to possess all the goods of others; and even this is not enough; he also wishes to rule over the universal heaven; as can be seen from the modern Babylonia. This then is 
the rule of the love of self; from which the rule of love toward the neighbor differs as heaven does from hell.  [3] But although such is the nature of the rule of the love of self in societies, there 
is nevertheless a rule of love toward the neighbor even in kingdoms, with those who are wise from faith and love to God, for these love the neighbor. That these also dwell in the heavens, divided into 
nations, families, and households (although they are at the same time in societies, but according to spiritual relationships, which are those of the good of love and the truth of faith) of the Lord's 
Divine mercy elsewhere.      A continuation about this sixth earth in the starry heaven will be found at the end of the following chapter. </p>

At this point I was led to talk to the angels present with me about dominion. There are two kinds, one being that which belongs to love towards the neighbour, the other that which belongs to self-love. 
Dominion belonging to love towards the neighbour exists among those who dwell separated into households, families, and clans, whereas dominion belonging to self-love exists among those who dwell together 
in society. Among those who live separated into households, families, and clans, the one who is father of the clan has dominion, as do the heads of families under him, and as do the fathers of 
each household under these; 'father of the clan' describes one from whom families descend, and from those families households. But in the exercise of dominion all these leaders are moved by a love like 
that of a father towards his children, who teaches them how they must live, does what is good to them, and as far as he can gives them what is his. It never enters his mind to make them subordinate 
to himself as subjects or as domestic servants; rather, he loves them to obey him like sons obedient to their father. And since, as is well known, this love increases as it descends, the father of the 
clan is moved to action by a love more internal than that of the actual father from whom the sons directly spring. This kind of dominion also exists in the heavens because it is the kind of dominion 
that is the Lord's. His dominion arises out of Divine Love towards the whole human race.  </p>
<p></p>
<p><b>[2]</b>
 But dominion belonging to self-love, which is the opposite of dominion belonging to love towards the neighbour, 
came into being when people alienated themselves from the Lord; for to the extent that people do not love and worship the Lord they love and worship themselves, and also love the world rather 
than heaven. At this point it became necessary, for their own safety, for the clans consisting of families and households to come together in a single body and institute various forms of government. 
For to the extent that this love increased, so did evils of every sort, such as enmity, envy, hatred, vengeance, deceit, and brutality directed against all who opposed them. Furthermore the nature of 
that love is such that so far as it is given rein it rushes along, till at length everyone ruled by it wishes to have dominion over all others throughout the world, and everyone wishes to possess all 
the goods belonging to others. Nor indeed does it stop there; everyone wishes to have dominion as well over the whole of heaven, as may be recognized from the present-day Babylon. Such then is dominion 
belonging to self-love, dominion belonging to love towards the neighbour being as different from it as heaven is from hell.  </p>
<p></p>
<p><b>[3]</b>
 But although dominion belonging to self-love is such among people 
living in society, dominion belonging to love towards the neighbour nevertheless exists, even in kingdoms, among those who are wise on account of their belief in and love to God; for these love their 
neighbour. These too dwell in heaven divided into clans, families, and households, even though they live together in society; but they do so in accord with spiritual relationships, which are those of 
the good of love and the truth of faith. These in the Lord's Divine mercy will be spoken of elsewhere.  </p>

Tunc loqui dabatur cum {1} angelis qui apud me erant, de dominiis, quod duo (t)genera dominii sint, unum amoris erga proximum, et alterum amoris sui; et quod dominium amoris erga proximum sit inter 
illos qui separati in domos, familias, et gentes habitant; at dominium amoris sui inter illos qui in societate simul habitant; inter illos qui separati in domos, familias, et gentes vivunt, dominatur 
ille qui pater gentis est, et sub illo patresfamilias, et sub his patres cujusvis domus; pater gentis {2}dicitur,' ex quo familiae et ex familiis domus; sed omnes illi dominantur ex amore sicut patris 
{3} erga liberos, docet illos quomodo {4}vivent, benefacit illis, et quantum potest, ex suo illis dat; et nusquam in animum ejus venit subjicere illos sibi ut subditos aut sicut famulos, sed amat ut 
oboediant illi sicut filii patri suo; et quia hic amor crescit in descendendo, ut notum est, ideo pater gentis ex interiore amore agit quam ipse pater ex quo filii proxime sunt; tale etiam dominium est 
in caelis, quoniam tale dominium est Domini, est enim dominium Ipsius ex Divino Amore erga universum genus humanum. 	[2] At dominium amoris sui, quod oppositum est dominio amoris erga proximum, incepit 
cum homo se abalienavit a Domino, nam quantum homo (t)Dominum non amat et colit tantum se amat et colit, et tantum quoque amat mundum prae caelo; ex necessitate tunc, ut tuti essent, contulerunt 
se gentes cum familiis et domibus in unum; et iniverunt regimina sub variis formis; quantum enim ille amor crevit tantum creverunt omnis generis mala, sicut inimicitiae, invidiae, odia, vindictae, doli, 
saevitiae contra omnes qui se opponebant; et quoque ille amor talis est ut quantum ei laxantur frena, ruat, usque tandem ut unusquisque talis dominari velit super omnes alios in universo {5}terrarum 
orbe, et unusquisque velit possidere {6}omnia aliorum bona, immo nec hoc satis est sed etiam dominari vult super universum caelum, ut constare potest ex hodierna Babylonia; hoc nunc est dominium amoris 
sui, a quo tantum differt dominium amoris erga proximum quantum caelum ab inferno. 	[3] Sed quantumvis dominium amoris sui tale est in societatibus, usque tamen datur dominium amoris erga proximum, 
etiam in regnis {7}, apud illos qui sapientes sunt ex fide et amore in Deum, hi enim amant proximum; quod {8}hi etiam in caelis habitent distincti in gentes, familias, et domus, tametsi in societatibus 
simul {9}, sed secundum affinitates spirituales, quae sunt boni amoris et veri fidei, alibi, ex Divina Domini Misericordia, dicetur. 	Continuatio de sexta hac tellure in caelo astrifero ad finem 
capitis sequentis. @1 i spiritibus et$ @2 est$ @3 i est$ @4 vivant$ @5 tellure$ @6 omnium$ @7 i et republicis (rebuspublicis intended)$ @8 illi$ @9 i sicut in terra$ </p>
