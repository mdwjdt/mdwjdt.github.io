<h3 align="center" class="ired">属天的奥秘 第9905节</h3>
<h4 align="center"></h4><p><strong>9905.</strong>“又要将乌陵和土明放在决断的胸牌里”表来自主的神性真理在最后和最低事物中的光芒。这从“决断的胸牌”、“乌陵和土明”的含义清楚可知：“决断的胸牌”是指从主的神性良善闪耀出来的神性真理（参看<a href="9857.htm">9857</a>节）；“乌陵和土明”是指来自那里的光和光芒。“乌陵和土明”之所以表示光和光芒，是因为天堂之光通过胸牌上的这些石头放出各种不同的光芒，这些光芒取决于通过它们所给出的答复。这也解释了为何它们具有不同的颜色。从主的神性良善发出的神性真理在天使面前显为光；这神性真理是一切天堂之光的源头。源于它的颜色，就是天使当中的那光的修改，是他们中间的聪明和智慧的变化；因为一切智慧和聪明皆是这神性真理或光的产物。由此可见，这光所放射的各种颜色的光芒是媒介，作为答复而来的神性真理通过这媒介而呈现在天堂中。当向神求问某事时，乌陵和土明也有类似功能。不过，要知道，当在它们里面看见光芒时，宣布答复的同时也会发出一种听得见的声音。这种宣布通过天使来完成，主通过这种光芒向他们揭示这个答复；因为如前所述，作为答复而来的神性真理以这种方式呈现在天堂中。<br />天堂之光就是从主的神性良善发出的神性真理（参看<a href="1053.htm">1053</a>，<a href="1521.htm">1521</a>-<a href="1533.htm">1533</a>，<a href="1619.htm">1619</a>-<a href="1632.htm">1632</a>，<a href="2776.htm">2776</a>，<a href="3094.htm">3094</a>，<a href="3138.htm">3138</a>，<a href="3167.htm">3167</a>，<a href="3190.htm">3190</a>，<a href="3195.htm">3195</a>，<a href="3222.htm">3222</a>，<a href="3223.htm">3223</a>，<a href="3337.htm">3337</a>，<a href="3339.htm">3339</a>，<a href="3341.htm">3341</a>，<a href="3636.htm">3636</a>，<a href="3643.htm">3643</a>，<a href="3862.htm">3862</a>，<a href="3993.htm">3993</a>，<a href="4060.htm">4060</a>，<a href="4180.htm">4180</a>，<a href="4302.htm">4302</a>，<a href="4408.htm">4408</a>，<a href="4414.htm">4414</a>，<a href="4415.htm">4415</a>，<a href="4419.htm">4419</a>，<a href="4527.htm">4527</a>，<a href="4598.htm">4598</a>，<a href="5400.htm">5400</a>，<a href="6032.htm">6032</a>，<a href="6313.htm">6313</a>，<a href="6315.htm">6315</a>，<a href="6608.htm">6608</a>，<a href="6907.htm">6907</a>，<a href="7174.htm">7174</a>，<a href="8644.htm">8644</a>，<a href="8707.htm">8707</a>，<a href="8861.htm">8861</a>，<a href="9399.htm">9399</a>，<a href="9407.htm">9407</a>，<a href="9570.htm">9570</a>，<a href="9571.htm">9571</a>e节）；颜色出现在天堂中，它们是这光在天使当中的修改，因而是他们当中的聪明和智慧的变化（<a href="3993.htm">3993</a>，<a href="4530.htm">4530</a>，<a href="4677.htm">4677</a>，<a href="4742.htm">4742</a>，<a href="4922.htm">4922</a>，<a href="9466.htm">9466</a>，<a href="9467.htm">9467</a>，<a href="9865.htm">9865</a>节）。<br />事实的确如此，这一点从“乌陵和土明”的含义也明显看出来；因为“乌陵”表示一道闪亮的火；“土明”表示从它发出的光芒。闪亮的火是从主的神性之爱的神性良善发出的神性真理，光芒是在最后和最低层，因而在结果中的神性真理。然而，要知道，在希伯来语，“土明”表示“完整”；但在天使的语言中，它表示“光芒”。之所以说“在天使的语言中”，是因为当天使互相交谈时，他们想到的是在他们内心深处所感知到的某个事物的本质，因此他们根据其本质说话。他们的言语从这些洞察中流入唯独适合天使听见的声音中。适合神性真理光芒的声音就是土明，它的名字即源于此。当有人用希伯来语读土（thum）这个词时，天使对它有相似的理解，土（thum）表示完整或完整性。这解释了为何就圣言的内义而言，“完整”表示结果层面的神性真理，也就是照神性诫命所过的一种生活，这从圣言中的大量经文可以看出来（如约书亚记<a href="http://39-27.cn/书24.14.htm">24:14</a>；士师记<a href="http://39-27.cn/士9.16.htm">9:16</a>，<a href="http://39-27.cn/士9.19.htm">19</a>；诗篇<a href="http://39-27.cn/诗25.21.htm">25:21</a>；<a href="http://39-27.cn/诗37.37.htm">37:37</a>；<a href="http://39-27.cn/诗84.11.htm">84:11</a>；<a href="http://39-27.cn/诗101.2.htm">101:2</a>；<a href="http://39-27.cn/诗119.1.htm">119:1</a>）。<br />这也解释了为何乌陵和土明被称为“以色列人的审判”，以及“决断的胸牌”，同样被称为“乌陵的判断”；因为“审判或决断、判断”表示教义和生活上的神性真理（参看<a href="9857.htm">9857</a>节）。由此可见，通过乌陵和土明，也就是说，通过天堂之光的光芒，胸牌揭示了在属世气场中，因而在最后和最低层的神性真理。类似的光芒也出现在那些处于源于良善的真理之人的心智中。当他们出于内心的情感寻求真理，并像热爱良善那样热爱它时，这光芒就向他们宣布，可以说提供答复。这种光芒就是神性真理在那些被圣言光照之人的属世人中从天堂被揭示所用的手段；世人对此没有任何概念，因为他们不知道光照人的理解力的任何天堂之光。不过，我被允许察觉并实实在在地看到，这一切的确如此。<br />要进一步知道，这种光芒出现在最后和最低层，是因为来自神性的光的一切形式一直降至最远的边界；它们因降至那么远的地方，故也在那里并从那里发光。这解释了为何胸牌安在以弗得上，在以弗得的腰带之上；因为以弗得代表在最后和最低层的神性真理（<a href="9824.htm">9824</a>节）；而它的腰带代表一个共同的纽带，这个纽带的存在是为了将一切事物保持在关联之中（<a href="9828.htm">9828</a>，<a href="9837.htm">9837</a>节）。这就是为何经上说“要把胸牌系住，把它的环子与以弗得的环子系在一块儿，使它贴在以弗得的带子上，胸牌不可从以弗得上脱下来”（28:28）。以色列人的名字之所以也刻在这些石头上，是因为十二支派同样代表天堂里的神性良善和真理的一切方面或事物，因而代表天堂和那里的一切社群；不过，它们照着圣言提及它们的顺序而代表不同的事物（参看<a href="3858.htm">3858</a>，<a href="3862.htm">3862</a>，<a href="3926.htm">3926</a>，<a href="3939.htm">3939</a>，<a href="4060.htm">4060</a>，<a href="4603.htm">4603</a>，<a href="6335.htm">6335</a>，<a href="6337.htm">6337</a>，<a href="6397.htm">6397</a>，<a href="6640.htm">6640</a>，<a href="7836.htm">7836</a>，<a href="7891.htm">7891</a>，<a href="7973.htm">7973</a>，<a href="7996.htm">7996</a>，<a href="7997.htm">7997</a>节）。</p>

And thou shalt put unto the breastplate of judgment the Urim and Thummim. That this signifies the shining forth of Divine truth from the Lord in ultimates, is evident from the signification of "the breastplate 
of judgment," as being Divine truth shining forth from the Divine good of the Lord (see n. 9857); and from the signification of "the Urim and Thummim," as being light and the shining forth 
therefrom. That "the Urim and Thummim" denote light shining forth, is because through the stones in the breastplate the light of heaven shone forth with variety according to the answers that were being 
given through them. For this reason they were of different colors. For the Divine truth that proceeds from the Lord's Divine good appears before the angels as light, and from it is all the light of 
heaven. The colors derived from it, which are modifications of this light with the angels, are variegations of intelligence and wisdom with them; for all wisdom and intelligence are from this Divine truth 
or light. From this it can be seen that by the shining forth of various colors from this light, Divine truths, which are answers, are presented to view in the heavens. In like manner there was a 
shining forth through the Urim and Thummim, when inquiry was made of the Divine. But be it known that when the shining forth appeared, then at the same time an answer to the subject of inquiry was given 
in an audible voice. This was done through angels, to whom this answer was revealed by the Lord by means of such a shining forth; for, as before said, Divine truths which are answers appear in this 
manner in the heavens. [2] (That the light of heaven is the Divine truth that proceeds from the Lord's Divine good, see n. 1053, 1521-1533, 1619-1632, 2776, 3094, 3138, 3167, 3190, 3195, 3222, 3223, 
3337, 3339, 3341, 3636, 3643, 3862, 3993, 4060, 4180, 4302, 4408, 4414, 4415, 4419, 4527, 4598, 5400, 6032, 6313, 6315, 6608, 6907, 7174, 8644, 8707, 8861, 9399, 9407, 9570, 9571; and that colors appear 
in the heavens, and that they are modifications of this light with the angels, thus are variegations of intelligence and wisdom with them, n. 3993, 4530, 4677, 4742, 4922, 9466, 9467, 9865.)  [3] 
That this is the case, is also evident from the signification of "the Urim and Thummim;" for "Urim" means a shining fire; and "Thummim," the shining forth therefrom; the "shining fire" denotes the Divine 
truth from the Divine good of the Lord's Divine love, and the "shining forth" denotes this same truth in ultimates, thus in the effect. But be it known that in the Hebrew tongue "Thummim" means "integrity;" 
but in the angelic tongue a "shining forth." It is said "in the angelic tongue" because the angels converse with one another from the very essence of the subject perceived inwardly within 
themselves, thus according to its quality. From this the speech flows forth into a conformable sound that is audible to the angels only. The shining forth of the Divine truth is, in sound, "Thummim," 
whence comes its name. The like is perceived by the angels when thum is read in the Hebrew tongue, by which is signified what is entire, or integrity. It is from this that by "integrity,"* in the internal 
sense of the Word, is signified Divine truth in the effect, which is a life according to the Divine commandments (as can be seen from many passages in the Word; as Josh. 24:14; Judges 9:16, 19; Ps. 
25:21; 37:37; 84:11; 101:2; 119:1). [4] From this also it is that the Urim and Thummim are called "the judgment of the sons of Israel," also "the breastplate of judgment," and likewise "the judgment 
of Urim;" for "judgment" signifies Divine truth in doctrine and in life, as may be seen above (n. 9857). From all this it can now be seen that through the Urim and Thummim, that is to say, through 
the shining forth of the light of heaven, the breastplate revealed Divine truths in the natural sphere, thus in ultimates. There is also a similar shining forth inwardly with those who are in truths from 
good, which dictates, and as it were gives answers, when truth is sought from the affection of the heart, and when it is loved as good. That there is such a shining forth, whereby Divine truth is 
revealed from heaven in the natural man, with those who are enlightened from the Word, is not perceived in the world, for the reason that it is not known that any light from heaven enlightens man's understanding. 
But that such is the case has been given me to perceive, and also to see. Be it known further that this shining forth appears in ultimates, because all things that belong to light from the 
Divine descend even to the ultimate bounds; and because they descend to these, they also shine forth there, and from thence. This then is the reason why the breastplate was put upon the ephod, and above 
its girdle; for the ephod represented Divine truth in ultimates (n. 9824); and its girdle represented a general bond, that all things might be held in connection (n. 9828, 9837). Therefore it is 
said, "and they shall bind the breastplate by the rings thereof unto the rings of the ephod, that it may be upon the girdle of the ephod, and that the breastplate withdraw not from upon the ephod" (verse 
28 of this chapter). The reason why the names of the sons of Israel were also engraved on it, was that the twelve tribes likewise represented all things of Divine good and truth in the heavens, consequently 
heaven together with all the societies there; and that they represented various things according to the order in which they are mentioned in the Word (see n. 3858, 3862, 3926, 3939, 4060, 4603, 
6335, 6337, 6397, 6640, 7836, 7891, 7973, 7996, 7997). * Rendered "sincerity," "integrity," "perfection," and "uprightness," in the English Bible. [REVISER.] </p>

'And you shall put into the breastplate of judgement the Urim and Thummim' means the radiance of Divine Truth from the Lord in last and lowest things. This is clear from the meaning of 'the breastplate 
of judgement' as Divine Truth shining forth from the Lord's Divine Good, dealt with in <a href="9857.htm">9857</a>; and from the meaning of 'the Urim and Thummim' as the light and radiance from there. The reason why light 
and radiance are meant by 'the Urim and Thummim' is that through the stones in the breastplate varying radiations of the light of heaven were emitted, these being determined by the answers given through 
them. This also explains why they assumed different colours. For the Divine Truth emanating from the Lord's Divine Good manifests itself to the angels as light; it is the source of all the light 
of heaven. The colours from it, which are modifications of that light among the angels, are variations of intelligence and wisdom among them; for all wisdom and intelligence is a product of that Divine 
Truth or light. From this it may be recognized that radiations of that light in various colours are the medium through which Divine Truths coming as answers present themselves in the heavens. A similar 
function was served by the Urim and Thummim when God was asked something. But it should be remembered that whenever a radiance was seen in them the answer was declared at the same time by an audible 
voice. This declaration was made through angels, to whom what they declared had been revealed by the Lord through such a radiance; for as has been stated, this is how Divine Truths coming as answers 
present themselves in heaven.  </p>

<p></p>
<p><b>[3]</b>
 The meaning of the words 'Urim' 
and 'Thummim' also goes to show that all this is so; for 'Urim' means a shining fire, and 'Thummim' the radiance from it. A shining fire is the Divine Truth emanating from the Divine Good of the 
Lord's Divine Love, and the radiance is that Truth on last and lowest levels, thus in effects. It should be recognized however that 'Thummim' in the Hebrew language means wholeness; it is in the angelic 
language that it means radiance. The expression 'in the angelic language' is used because when angels talk to one another they are thinking of the very essence of some matter as perceived deep within 
themselves, thus they speak in terms of its essential nature. What they express flows from those insights into appropriate sounds audible to the angels alone. The appropriate sound for the radiance 
of Divine Truth is Thummim. This then is the source of the term. Angels have a similar understanding of the word thum, meaning that which is whole or wholeness, whenever someone reads it in the Hebrew 
language. This explains why in the internal sense of the Word 'that which is whole' is used to mean Divine Truth on the level of effects, which is a life led in keeping with Divine commandments, as 
is made clear in a large number of places in the Word, such as <a href="http://bible.gospelcom.net/cgi-bin/bible?passage=Joshua%2024:14&amp;version=ESV&amp;interface=print&amp;showfn=yes&amp;showxref">Joshua 24:14</a>; <a href="http://bible.gospelcom.net/cgi-bin/bible?passage=Judges%209:16,%2019&amp;version=ESV&amp;interface=print&amp;showfn=yes&amp;showxref">Judges 9:16, 19</a>; <a href="http://bible.gospelcom.net/cgi-bin/bible?passage=Psalms%2025:21;%2037:37;%2084:11;%20101:2;%20119:1&amp;version=ESV&amp;interface=print&amp;showfn=yes&amp;showxref">Psalms 25:21; 37:37; 84:11; 101:2; 119:1</a>. </p>
<p><b>[4]</b>
 This also explains why the Urim and Thummim are called the 
judgement of the children of Israel, as well as the breastplate of judgement, and also the judgement of the Urim; for 'judgement' means Divine Truth in doctrine and life, see above in <a href="9857.htm">9857</a>. From all this 
it may now become clear that by means of the Urim and Thummim, that is, by means of the radiance produced by the light of heaven, the breastplate revealed Divine Truths in the natural sphere, thus 
on last and lowest levels. A like radiance also presents itself in the minds of those who are guided by truths springing from good. This radiance declares to them, so to speak provides the answers, when 
with heartfelt desire they seek to know what is true and love it as that which is good. That this kind of radiance is the means by which Divine Truth from heaven is revealed in the natural man of 
those who are enlightened by the Word is something which the world has no idea of, because the world does not know of any light from heaven that shines in the human understanding. But I have been allowed 
to realize and actually see that all this is so.  </p>
<p></p>
<p><b>[5]</b>
 In addition it should be recognized that this radiance appears on last and lowest levels because all forms of light from the Divine reach right 
down to the furthest ends; and since they reach down that far they also shine in them and from them. This now explains why the breastplate was placed over the ephod and above the girdle of it; for 
the ephod represented Divine Truth on last and lowest levels, <a href="9824.htm">9824</a>, while its girdle represented a common bond that existed to hold all things in connection, <a href="9828.htm">9828</a>, <a href="9837.htm">9837</a>. This is why verse 28 of the 
present chapter says, And they shall tie the breastplate from its rings to the rings of the ephod, so that it is above the girdle of the ephod and the breastplate will not come away from upon the ephod. 
The reason why the names of the sons of Israel were in addition engraved [on the stones] was that the twelve tribes also represented all aspects of Divine Good and Truth in the heavens, consequently 
heaven and all the communities there, though that representation varied according to the order in which they are mentioned in the Word, see <a href="3858.htm">3858</a>, <a href="3862.htm">3862</a>, <a href="3926.htm">3926</a>, <a href="3939.htm">3939</a>, <a href="4060.htm">4060</a>, <a href="4603.htm">4603</a>, <a href="6335.htm">6335</a>, <a href="6337.htm">6337</a>, <a href="6397.htm">6397</a>, <a href="6640.htm">6640</a>,

nam ut dictum, Divina Vera quae responsa, in caelis ita apparent. 	[2] Quod lux caeli sit Divinum Verum procedens a Divino Bono Domini, videatur n. 1053, 1521-1533, 1619-1632, 2776, 3094, 3138, 3167, 
3190, 3195, 3222, (x)3223, 3337, 3339, 3341, 3636, 3643, 3862, 3993, 4060, 4180, 4302, 4408, 4414, 4415, 4419, 4527, 4598, 5400, 6032, 6313, 6315, 6608, 6907, 7174, 8644, 8707, 8861, 9399, 9407, 
9570, 9571 fin.  Et quod colores in caelis appareant, et quod illi sint modificationes illius lucis apud angelos, ita variegationes intelligentiae et sapientiae apud illos, n. 3993, 4530, 4677, 4742, 
4922, 9466, 9467, 9865. 	[3] Quod ita sit, etiam constat ex significatione `Urim et Thumim,' `Urim' enim significat ignem lucentem, et `Thumim' exsplendescentiam inde; ignis lucens est Divinum Verum 
ex Divino Bono Divini Amoris Domini,et exsplendescentia est id Verum in ultimis, ita in effectu; (x)at sciendum quod Thumim in lingua Hebraea sit integritas, sed in lingua angelica {2}exsplendescentia; 
dicitur in lingua angelica,quia angeli inter se loquuntur ex ipsa essentia rei percepta intus in se, ita secundum quale ejus, sermo inde effluit in sonorum conforme, audibile solum angelis; exsplendescentia 
Divini Veri est sonorum Thumim; inde nunc est ejus denominatio; simile percipitur ab angelis, quando thum in lingua Hebraea legitur, per quod significatur integrum seu integritas; inde est quod 
per integrum in Verbi sensu interno (x)significetur Divinum Verum in effectu, quod est vita secundum Divina praecepta, ut constare potest ex pluribus locis in Verbo, ut apud Joschuam xxiv 14; in Libro 
Judicum ix 16, 19; apud Davidem Ps. xxv 21; Ps xxxvii 37; Ps. lxxxiv 12 (A.V. 11); Ps. ci 2; Ps. cxix 1. 	[4] Inde quoque est quod Urim et Thumim dicantur judicium filiorum Israelis, tum pectorale 
judicii, ut et judicium Urim, nam `judicium' significat Divinum Verum doctrina et vita, videatur supra n. 9857.  (s)Ex his nunc constare potest quod pectorale per Urim et Thumim, hoc est, per lucis 
caeli exsplendescentiam revelaverit Divina Vera in sphaera naturali, ita in ultimis; similis exsplendescentia {3}etiam sistitur intus apud illos qui in veris ex bono sunt, quae dictat et quasi responsa 
dat, (x)cum ex affectione cordis (t)verum inquiritur, et id amatur sicut bonum; quod talis exsplendescentia sit per quam Divinum Verum e caelo revelatur in naturali homine apud illos qui illustrantur 
ex Verbo: non percipitur in mundo, ex causa quia ignoratur quod lux aliqua e caelo intellectuale hominis illustret; sed quod ita sit, datum est percipere et quoque videre. 	[5] Sciendum porro quod 
exsplendescentia illa appareat in ultimis quoniam omnia quae lucis a Divino sunt descendunt usque ad fine ultimos; et quia illuc descendunt, etiam ibi et inde elucent; inde nunc est quod pectorale super 
{4}ephodum et super ejus cingulum positum esset; nam ephodum repraesentabat Divinum Verum in ultimis, n. 9824, et cingulum ejus (m)repraesentabat commune vinculum ut omnia tenerentur in nexu, n. 9828, 
9837; ideo dicitur, Et alligabunt pectorale ex annulis suis ad annulos ephodi, ad esse super cingulo ephodi, nec recedet pectorale a super ephodo, vers. 28 hujus capitis.(n)  Quod nomina filiorum 
Israelis etiam insculpta fuissent, erat causa quia duodecim tribus quoque repraesentabant omnia Divini Boni et Veri in caelis, proinde caelum cum omnibus ibi societatibus, et quod varia secundum ordinem 
in quo nominantur in Verbo, videantur n. 3858, 3862, 3926, 3939, 4060, 4603, 6335, 6337, 6397, 6640, 7836, 7891, 7973, 7996, 7997.(s) @1 sint$ @2 i sit$ @3 in ultimis est$ @4 Ephodo et cingulo$ </p>
