A continuation follows at the end of this chapter.      GENESIS 15      1. After these words, the word of Jehovah came unto Abram in a vision, saying, Fear not, Abram; I am a shield to thee, thy exceeding 
great reward.      2. And Abram said, Lord Jehovih, what wilt Thou give me, and I am walking childless, and the steward of my house is this Eliezer the Damascene?      3. And Abram said, Lo 
to me Thou hast not given seed, and behold a son of my house is mine heir.      4. And behold the word of Jehovah came unto him, saying, This one shall not be thine heir; but he that shall go forth out 
of thy bowels shall be thine heir.      5. And He led him forth abroad, and said, Look now toward heaven, and number the stars, if thou be able to number them; and He said unto him, So shall thy seed 
be.      6. And he believed in Jehovah, and He imputed it to him for righteousness.      7. And He said unto him, I am Jehovah who led thee forth out of Ur of the Chaldees, to give thee this land, 
to inherit it.      8. And he said, Lord Jehovih, whereby shall I know that I shall inherit it?      9. And He said unto him, Take thee a heifer of three years, and a she-goat of three years, and 
a ram of three years, and a turtledove, and a young pigeon.      10. And he took unto him all these and divided them in the midst, and laid each part over against the other; and the birds he did not 
divide.      11. And the fowls came down upon the bodies, and Abram drove them away.      12. And it came to pass when the sun was going down that a deep sleep fell upon Abram; and behold a terror 
of great darkness falling upon him.      13. And He said unto Abram, Knowing thou shalt know that thy seed shall be a stranger in a land that is not theirs, and shall serve them; and they shall afflict 
them four hundred years.      14. And also that nation whom they shall serve will I judge; and after that shall they go out with great substance.      15. And thou shalt go to thy fathers in peace; 
thou shalt be buried in a good old age.      16. And in the fourth generation they shall return hither, for the iniquity of the Amorites is not yet consummated.      17. And it came to pass that 
the sun went down, and there was thick darkness; and behold a furnace of smoke, and a torch of fire that passed between those pieces.      18. In that day Jehovah made a covenant with Abram, saying, 
Unto thy seed will I give this land, from the river of Egypt unto the great river, the river Euphrates: </p>
<p>     19. The Kenite, and the Kenizzite, and the Kadmonite;       20. And the Hittite, and the 
Perizzite, and the Rephaim;       21. And the Amorite, and the Canaanite, and the Girgashite, and the Jebusite. </p>

<p>                          CAPUT XV 	1.  POST verba haec factum est verbum JEHOVAE ad Abram, in visione, dicendo, Ne timeas Abram, Ego clypeus tibi, merces 
tua multa valde. 	2.  Et dixit Abram, DOMINE JEHOVIH, quid dabis mihi, et ego ambulans improles {1}, et filius procurator domus meae, is Damascenus Eliezer? 	@1 I has improlis throughout chapter.$ 	3. 
 Et dixit Abram, En mihi non dedisti semen, et ecce illius domus meae hereditans me. 	4.  Et ecce verbum JEHOVAE ad illum, dicendo, Non hereditabit te hic, verum qui egredietur e visceribus 
tuis, ille hereditabit te. 	5.  Et educens illum foras, et dixit, Specta quaeso versus caelum, et numera stellas, si poteris numerare illas; et dixit illi, Ita erit semen tuum. 	6.  Et credidit in 
JEHOVAM, et imputavit illud ipsi in justitiam. 	7.  Et dixit ad illum, Ego JEHOVAH, Qui eduxi te ex Ur Chaldaeorum, ad dandum tibi terram hanc, ad hereditandum illam. 	8.  Et dixit, DOMINE JEHOVIH, 
ex quo cognoscam quod hereditabo illam. 	9.  Et dixit ad illum, Accipe tibi {1} vitulam triennem, et capram triennem, et arietem triennem, et turturem, et pullum. 	@1 Heb. = Mihi.$ 	10.  Et accepit 
sibi omnia illa, et partitus est illa in medium, et dedit quamvis partem suam obviam alteri; et volucrem non partitus. 	11.  Et descendit volatile super corpora, et abegit illa Abram. 	12.  Et fuit 
sol ad occidendum, et sopor cecidit super Abram, et ecce terror tenebrarum magnarum cadens super illum. 	13.  Et dixit Abramo, Cognoscendo cognosces, quod peregrinum erit semen tuum in terra, non illis; 
et servient iis {1}, et affligent illos quadringentis annis. 	@1 n. 1840 and 1845 have servient illis. Iis seems better as it has a reference different from that of the following illos in affligent 
illos.$ 	14.  Et etiam gentem, cui servient, judicabo Ego; et postquam ita, exibunt acquisitione magna. 	15.  Et tu venies ad patres tuos in pace, sepelieris in senio bono. 	16.  Et generatione 
quarta redibunt huc, quia non consummata iniquitas Emoraeorum usque huc. 	17.  Et fuit, sol occidit, et caligo facta, et ecce furnus fumi; et fax ignis, quae transivit inter segmenta illa. 	18.  In 
die illo pepigit JEHOVAH cum Abramo foedus, dicendo: Semini tuo dabo terram hanc, a fluvio Aegypti, usque fluvium magnum fluvium Phrath. 	19.  Kenitam, et Kenizzitam, et Kadmonitam. 	20.  Et Hittitam, 
et Perizzitam, et Rephaim. 	21.  Et Emoritam, et Canaanitam, et Girgashitam, et Jebusitam. </p>
