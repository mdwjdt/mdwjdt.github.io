<h3 align="center" class="ired">属天的奥秘 第4330节</h3>
<h4 align="center"></h4><p><strong>4330.</strong>由于三层天堂一起构成大人，并且如前所述，身体的一切肢体、内脏和器官都照它们所发挥的功能和功用而与它相对应；不仅外在的、显为可见的事物与它相对应，而且内在的、未显为可见的事物也与它相对应。因此，外在人的事物与它对应，内在人的事物也与它对应。与外在人的事物相对应的灵人并天使社群绝大部分来自这个星球；而与内在人的事物相对应的社群大部分来自别的地方。天上的这些社群行如一体，犹如外在人与内在人在重生之人里面行如一体。然而，如今很少有来自这个星球的人进入来世外在人与内在人行如一体的人当中，因为大多数人都是感官的，以致除了认为人的外在构成整个人，并且当这一切逝去时（如当他死亡时的情形），几乎剩不下具有生命的任何事物外，很少有人相信别的。他们更不相信有一个活在外在当中内在，并且当这外在逝去时，内在特别有生命。<br />我通过亲身经历被指示这些人如何反对内在人：来自这个星球、在世时就具有这种秉性的众多灵人出现了，与内在感官人有关的其他灵人来到他们眼前；这时，他们立刻开始骚扰这些灵人，就跟没有理性的人总是根据感官谬论和由这些谬论所产生的错觉，以及毫无根据的假设来谈论和推理，以此骚扰有理性的人差不多；因为除了能通过外在感官事物证明的东西外，他们什么也不信。此外，这些灵人还使内在人受到侮辱。<br />但与内在感官人有关的灵人根本不关心这类事物，不仅对前面灵人的疯狂感到惊讶，还对他们的愚蠢感到惊讶。说来奇怪，当外在感官灵人接近内在感官灵人，并且几乎进入其思维的气场时，外在感官灵人开始呼吸困难（因为灵人和天使也要呼吸，和世人一样，只是他们的呼吸相对内在，<a href="3884.htm">3884</a>，<a href="3885.htm">3885</a>等，<a href="3893.htm">3893</a>节），因而几乎窒息，以致他们退了回去。他们离内在感官灵人越远，他们当中就越变得平稳和安静，因为他们发现呼吸更顺畅了；他们靠得越近，他们当中就越变得不安和焦躁。<br />原因在于，当外在感官灵人陷入自己的谬论、错觉、毫无根据的假设，因而陷入虚假时，他们就感到平静；但当反过来，这类事物从他们那里被除去时，如当内在人以真理之光流入时的情形，他们就感到不安。因为在来世，思维和情感在他们自己周围制造气场，这些气场照着他们彼此同在和靠近的程度相互交流（<a href="1048.htm">1048</a>，<a href="1053.htm">1053</a>，<a href="1316.htm">1316</a>，<a href="1504.htm">1504</a>-<a href="1512.htm">1512</a>，<a href="1695.htm">1695</a>，<a href="2401.htm">2401</a>，<a href="2489.htm">2489</a>节）。这种冲突会持续数小时；以这种方式我被指示，如今这个星球的成员如何反对内在人，并且对他们来说，外在感官意识几乎构成他们里面的全部。</p>

As the three heavens together constitute the Grand Man, and (as before said) all the members, viscera, and organs of the body correspond to this man according to their functions and uses, there correspond 
to it not only those which are external and are apparent to the sight, but also those which are internal and not apparent to the sight; consequently those which are of the external man, and those 
which are of the internal man. The societies of spirits and angels to which the things of the external man correspond, are for the most part from this earth; but those to which the things of the internal 
man correspond are for the most part from elsewhere. These societies act as a one in the heavens just as with the regenerate man do the external and the internal man. And yet at the present day 
few from this earth come into the other life in whom the external man acts as one with the internal; for most are sensuous, insomuch that there are few who believe otherwise than that man's external is 
all there is of him; and that when this passes away (as when he dies) there is scarcely anything left that lives; much less do they believe that there is an internal which lives in the external, and 
that when the external passes away, the internal eminently lives.  [2] It has been shown by living experience how these are opposed to the internal man. There were present very many spirits from this 
earth, who when they had lived in the world had been of this character, and there came into their sight spirits who relate to the internal sensuous man, and they at once began to infest them, almost 
as irrational persons infest those who are rational, by constantly speaking and reasoning from the fallacies of the senses, and from the illusions thence arising, and from mere hypotheses, believing 
nothing but what could be confirmed by external sensuous things, and moreover treating the internal man with contumely.  [3] But those who had relation to the internal sensuous man cared nothing for 
such things, and wondered not only at the insanity of the former spirits, but also at their stupidity; and wonderful to say, when the external sensuous spirits drew near the internal sensuous ones, and 
came almost into the sphere of their thoughts, the external sensuous began to breathe with difficulty (for spirits and angels breathe equally as do men, but their breathing is relatively internal, n. 
3884-3895), and thus to be almost suffocated, so that they withdrew. And the further away they retired from the internal sensuous spirits, because they breathed more easily, the more tranquil and quiet 
it became with them; and again the nearer they approached, the more intranquil and unquiet. [4] The cause was that when the external sensuous are in their fallacies, phantasies, and hypotheses, and 
thence in falsities, they have tranquillity; but when on the contrary such things are taken away from them, which comes to pass when the internal man flows in with the light of truth, they then have 
intranquility. For in the other life there exist spheres of the thoughts and affections, and these are mutually communicated according to presence and approach (n. 1048, 1053, 1316, 1504-1512, 1695, 
2401, 2489). This conflict lasted for several hours; and it was thus shown how the men of this earth are at the present day opposed to the internal man, and that the external sensuous makes almost all 
with them. </p>

<p align="center"><b>Elliott(1983-1999) 4330</b></p><p><b>4330.</b>
Inasmuch as the three heavens together constitute the Grand Man and, as has been stated above, all the members, viscera, and organs of the body correspond to it according to the functions and uses they 
serve, not only things which are external and outwardly visible correspond to it but also those which are internal and not outwardly visible. Consequently things of the external man correspond to it, 
and so do those of the internal man. The communities of spirits and angels to which things of the external man correspond come to a considerable extent from this planet, whereas the communities to 
which things of the internal man correspond come for the most part from elsewhere. These communities in the heavens act as one in the way that the external man and the internal man do with someone who 
is regenerate. But at the present day few from this planet are entering the next life with whom the external man acts in unison with the internal, for the majority are sensory-minded, so much so that 
there are few who believe anything other than that man's external constitutes the whole person and that when this departs, as happens when the person dies, scarcely anything is left which has life. Still 
less do they believe that there is an internal which has life within the external, and that when the external departs the internal especially has life. </p>
<p></p>
<p><b>[2]</b>
 I was shown by an actual experience 
how these persons are opposed to the internal man. Very many spirits from this planet were present who had been like them when they lived in the world. Before their eyes there came other spirits who related 
to the internal sensory man, at which point they began instantly to annoy these other spirits, almost in the way irrational persons annoy rational ones by speaking and reasoning all the time from 
the misconceptions of the senses and from illusions resulting from such misconceptions and wholly groundless assumptions, and as they do so believing nothing except that which could be proved by external 
sensory evidence. And in addition to this those spirits subjected the internal man to insults. </p>
<p></p>
<p><b>[3]</b>
 But those who related to the internal sensory man were not troubled at all by such things, 
being amazed not only at the madness of those spirits from this planet but also at their stupidity. And wonder that it was, when the external, sensory-minded spirits drew near the internal sensory ones 
and came virtually into the sphere of their thoughts the external, sensory-minded spirits began to find it difficult to breathe (for spirits and angels breathe no less than men, though their breathing 
in contrast to men's is internal, <a href="3884.htm">3884</a>, <a href="3885.htm">3885</a> and following paragraphs, <a href="3893.htm">3893</a>) and so were almost choked, on account of which they drew back. And the further away they moved from the internal sensory-minded 
spirits the more tranquil and quiet it became among them because they found it easier to breathe, and again the nearer they came to them the more intranquil and unquiet it became. </p>
<p></p>
<p><b>[4]</b>
 The reason 
for this was that when with external sensory-minded spirits their own misconceptions, delusions and groundless assumptions, and consequently falsities, are pre-eminent they feel tranquil but when 
conversely such things are removed from them, as happens when the internal man flows in with the light of truth, they feel intranquil. For thoughts and affections create spheres around themselves in 
the next life and these are communicated mutually from one party to another insofar as they become present with and draw near one another, <a href="1048.htm">1048</a>, <a href="1053.htm">1053</a>, <a href="1316.htm">1316</a>, <a href="1504.htm">1504</a>-<a href="1512.htm">1512</a>, <a href="1695.htm">1695</a>, <a href="2401.htm">2401</a>, <a href="2489.htm">2489</a>. The conflict 
described lasted for several hours, and in that way I was shown how at the present day members of this planet are opposed to the internal man and that with them external sensory awareness constitutes 
almost the whole in them. </p>

Quia tres caeli simul constituunt Maximum Hominem, et ei correspondent omnia membra, viscera et organa corporis secundum functiones et usus eorum, ut supra dictum, non {1} solum ei correspondent 
illa quae externi sunt et ad visum exstant, sed etiam quae interna et non ad visum exstant, proinde quae sunt externi hominis et quae sunt interni: societates spirituum et angelorum quibus correspondent 
illa quae sunt externi hominis, quoad multam partem sunt ex hac tellure; quibus autem correspondent illa quae sunt interni hominis, ad plurimam partem sunt aliunde; societates illae in caelis 
unum agunt, quemadmodum apud hominem regeneratum externus et internus homo; sed usque pauci hodie ex hac tellure in alteram vitam veniunt apud quos externus homo unum agit cum interno, sunt enim plerique 
sensuales, usque adeo ut pauci sint qui aliud credunt quam quod externum hominis sit omne hominis, et cum id recedit, ut fit cum moritur homo, vix aliquid residuum sit quod vivit, minus quod 
internum sit quod vivit in externo, et cum hoc recedit, illud imprimis vivat; [2] ostensum est per vivam experientiam quomodo hi sunt contra internum hominem; erant spiritus perplures ex hac tellure, 
qui cum vixerunt in mundo, tales fuerunt; in illorum conspectum veniebant spiritus qui internum sensualem hominem referebant, et (t)tunc ilico coeperunt illi infestare hos, paene sicut irrationales 
illos qui rationale sunt, loquendo et ratiocinando continue ex fallaciis sensuum exque illusionibus inde et ex meris hypothesibus, nihil credentes quam quod confirmari posset per sensualia externa, 
ac insuper contumeliis afficiebant internum hominem; [3] sed illi qui internum sensualem hominem referebant, talia nihil curabant, mirati non modo illorum insaniam sed etiam stupiditatem; et 
quod mirabile, cum sensuales externi approximarent ad sensuales internos, et paene in sphaeram cogitationum illorum venirent, sensuales externi incipiebant difficile respirare (respirant enim spiritus 
et angeli aeque ac homines, sed respiratio illis est interna respective, n. 3884, 3885 seq., 3893), ita paene suffocari, quapropter recesserunt; et quo longinquius a sensualibus internis aberant, quia 
facilius respirabant, eo tranquillius et quietius inter illos factum (o)est, et iterum quo propius accesserunt, eo intranquillius et irrequietius; [4] causa fuit quia cum sensuales externi 
in suis fallaciis, phantasiis et hypotheticis sunt et inde in falsis, illis tranquillum est, at vicissim cum talia eis auferuntur, quod fit cum internus homo cum luce veri influit, tunc illis intranquillum; 
(m) sphaerae (o)enim cogitationum et dantur in altera vita, et {2} communicantur mutuo secundum praesentiam et accessionem, n. 1048, 1053, [1316, 1504]-1512, 1695, 2401, 2489:(n) is conflictus perstabat 
per aliquot horas; et sic ostensum quomodo homines hujus telluris hodie contra internum hominem sunt et quod sensuale externum faciat paene omne apud illos.      @1 i et$      @2 quae$ </p>
