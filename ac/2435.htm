<h3 align="center" class="ired">属天的奥秘 第2435节</h3>
<h4 align="center"></h4><p><strong>2345.</strong>“我不倾覆你所说的这城”表他不会就这样灭亡，也就是说，这个人具有内含良善的真理。这从“城”的含义清楚可知，“城”是指真理（参看<a href="402.htm">402</a>，<a href="2268.htm">2268</a>，<a href="2428.htm">2428</a>节）。人们从上古时代就开始争论哪一个是教会头生的，是仁还是信。原因在于，人得以重生并成为一个教会所凭借的，是信之真理。但是，凡优先选择信并使其成为头生者之人全都陷入异端和虚假，并且最终完全灭绝了仁。如我们所读到的该隐，他就表示这类信，最后杀死了他的兄弟亚伯，而亚伯表示仁；还有后来的流便，雅各的长子，同样表示信，他污秽了父亲的床（创世记<a href="http://39-27.cn/创35.22.htm">35:22</a>；<a href="http://39-27.cn/创49.4.htm">49:4</a>），由此颜面尽失，长子的名分便给了约瑟（创世记<a href="http://39-27.cn/创48.5.htm">48:5</a>；历代志上<a href="http://39-27.cn/代上5.1.htm">5:1</a>）。<br />这就是针对圣言所提及的长子名分而引发的一切争论，以及一切律法的来源。存在这种论战的原因过去不为人知，就象现在不为人知一样，即一个人所拥有的信的量取决于他里面仁的量；人在重生时，仁会呈现给信，或也可说，良善会呈现给真理，将自己注入到它里面，使自身在每个细节方面都 适应它，并在这样做的过程中使信成为信；因此，仁才是教会真正的头生者，尽管在人看来并非如此（参看<a href="352.htm">352</a>，<a href="367.htm">367</a>节）。由于这些事以后会频繁提及，故蒙主怜悯，我们等到相关章节时再详细论述这个主题。</p>

That I will not overthrow the city of which thou hast spoken. That this signifies that so he would not perish, namely, the man with whom there is truth within which there is good, is evident from the 
signification of a "city," as being truth (see n. 402, 2268, 2428). It has been disputed from the most ancient times which is the firstborn of the church, charity or faith; for the reason that man is 
regenerated and becomes a church by means of the truths of faith. But they who have set faith foremost and made it the firstborn, have all fallen into heresies and falsities, and at length have extinguished 
charity altogether; as we read of Cain, by whom such faith is signified, that at length he killed his brother Abel, by whom is signified charity; and afterwards of Reuben, the firstborn son of 
Jacob, by whom likewise faith is signified, that he polluted his father's couch (Gen. 35:22; 49:4), and therefore was held unworthy, and the primogeniture was given to Joseph (Gen. 48:5; 1 Chron. 5:1). [2] 
This was the source of all the contentions, and also all the laws, respecting primogeniture that are mentioned in the Word. The cause of there being such a controversy was that it was not known, 
as even at this day it is not known, that a man has only so much of faith as he has of charity; and that when a man is being regenerated, charity presents itself to faith, or what is the same, good 
presents itself to truth, and insinuates itself into it and adapts itself to it in every particular, causing faith to be faith; and thus that charity is the very firstborn of the church, although to 
man it appears otherwise (see also n. 352, 367). But as these things will frequently be treated of hereafter, of the Lord's Divine mercy we shall say more on the subject as the occasion arises. </p>

'That I will not overthrow the city of which you have spoken' means that this being so he would not perish, that is to say, the person with whom the truth which has good within it is present. This is 
clear from the meaning of 'a city' as truth, dealt with in <a href="402.htm">402</a>, <a href="2268.htm">2268</a>, <a href="2428.htm">2428</a>. From most ancient times men have argued about which is the firstborn of the Church, whether charity or faith. The reason is 
that man is regenerated and made a Church by means of the truths of faith. But people who have given preference to faith and made it the firstborn have all sunk into heresies and falsities, and at length 
have annihilated charity altogether. One reads of Cain, for example, by whom a faith such as this is meant, that he at length killed Abel his brother, who means charity. One reads after this of Reuben, 
Jacob's firstborn, by whom also faith is meant; but he defiled his father's couch, <a href="http://bible.gospelcom.net/cgi-bin/bible?passage=Gen%2035:%2022;%2049:%204&amp;version=ESV&amp;interface=print&amp;showfn=yes&amp;showxref">Gen 35: 22; 49: 4</a>, as a result of which he was disgraced and the birthright passed to Joseph, <a href="http://bible.gospelcom.net/cgi-bin/bible?passage=Gen%2048:%2015;%201&amp;version=ESV&amp;interface=print&amp;showfn=yes&amp;showxref">Gen 48: 15; 1</a> 
<a href="http://bible.gospelcom.net/cgi-bin/bible?passage=Chron%205:%201&amp;version=ESV&amp;interface=print&amp;showfn=yes&amp;showxref">Chron 5: 1</a>. </p>
<p></p>
<p><b>[2]</b>
 This was the origin in the Word of all the disputes, and also the laws concerning the birthright. The reason for this controversy was that people did not know, even as it is not known 
today, that the amount of faith a person has depends on the amount of charity there is in him, and while a person is being regenerated charity offers itself to faith, or what amounts to the same, 
good offers itself to truth, and implants and accommodates itself in every part of it, and also in so doing causes faith to be faith. This being so, charity is really the firstborn of the Church, though 
to man it seems to be otherwise; see also <a href="352.htm">352</a>, <a href="367.htm">367</a>. But because these matters are the subject in many places after this, more in the Lord's Divine mercy will be said when those places are reached. </p>

Quod `non evertam urbem de qua locutus [es] significet quod sic non periret, nempe homo apud quem verum in quo intus est bonum, constat a significatione `urbis' quod sit verum, de qua n. 402, 2268, 
2428.  Ab antiquissimis temporibus controversum est quid primogenitum Ecclesiae, an charitas vel an fides, ex causa quia per vera fidei regeneratur homo et fit Ecclesia; sed qui praetulerunt fidem, et 
eam primogenitum fecerunt, lapsi sunt omnes in haereses et falsitates, et tandem charitatem prorsus exstinxerunt; sicut legitur de `Caino' per quem talis fides significatur, quod tandem `occiderit fratrem 
Habelem' per quem significatur charitas; similiter post {1} de `Reubene,' filio primogenito Jacobi, per quem quoque significatur fides, sed `is polluit patris sui cubile,' Gen. xxxv 22, xlix 4, 
quare indignus factus, et primogenitura data [est] Josepho, Gen. (x)xlviii 5; 1 Chron. v 1.  [2] Inde lites omnes, tum leges, de primogenitum in Verbo.  Causa quod ita controversum fuerit, erat quia nesciebant, 
sicut (t)hodie etiam nescitur, quod tantum fidei sit homini quantum charitatis, et dum regeneratur homo quod charitas occurrat fidei, seu quod idem, bonum occurrat vero, et singulis ejus se 
insinuet et inaptet, ac faciat quod fides sit fides; et sic quod charitas sit ipsum primogenitum Ecclesiae, tametsi coram homine aliter apparet, videatur etiam n. 352, 367. Sed quia de his agitur multum 
in sequentibus, plura, ex Divina Domini Misericordia, ibi. 	@1 postea.$ </p>
