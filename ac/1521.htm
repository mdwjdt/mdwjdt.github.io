<h3 align="center" class="ired">属天的奥秘 第1521节</h3>
<h4 align="center"></h4><p><h4 align="center">第13章  关于天使所在之光</h4><br />1521.我通过大量经历清楚得知，除了味觉外，灵人和天使拥有各种感觉，而且这些感觉远比世人的敏锐和完美得多。天使们不仅看到彼此，一起交谈，体验由相爱带来的无上幸福；而且他们在自己的世界所看到的东西比世人所能想像的还要多。灵人界和天堂充满诸如先知们所见到的代表性现象，并且数量如此之多，以致若人的视觉被打开，仅仅观看几个小时，他必目瞪口呆。天堂之光远远胜过世上正午之光，令人难以置信。然而，他们没有尘世之光，因为他们在这光所照耀的范围之上或之内；他们的光来自主，主是他们的太阳。在天使看来，即便尘世的正午之光也是浓密的黑暗；当得以注视这光时，他们仿佛在注视纯粹的黑暗，如我通过亲身经历所得知的那样。由此清楚可知，天堂之光与尘世之光何等不同。</p><br />

Not only can angels see and interact with each other 钬?finding their greatest happiness in mutual love, as they do 钬?they also have more to see in their surroundings than you could ever believe. The world of spirits and the heavens are full of representative objects like the ones the prophets saw, and these objects are so awe-inspiring that anyone whose eyes were simply opened to gaze on them for a few hours could not help being dumbfounded.<br />The light in heaven is such that it outshines even the noonday light of our solar system by an unbelievable amount. The inhabitants of heaven do not receive any light from this world, however, because they are too high or too deep for the reach of that light. Truth is light from the Lord, who is their sun.<br />Even the noonday light of the world is like thick darkness to angels. When they have the opportunity to look at worldly light, it is as if they were looking at utter darkness; this I have learned from experience. This shows the difference between heaven's light and the world's light. </p>

CHAPTER 13. CONCERNING THE LIGHT IN WHICH THE ANGELS LIVE. That spirits and angels possess every sense, except taste, far more exquisitely and perfectly than man ever does, has been made manifest to 
me in many ways. They not only see one another and converse together-the angels with the greatest happiness from mutual love-but in that world there is more to see than men could believe to be possible; 
the world of spirits and the heavens are full of representatives such as were seen by the prophets, and of so wonderful a nature that if a person's sight were but opened so that for a few hours he 
might behold them, he would be astounded. The light in heaven is such as to incredibly surpass even the midday light of our solar world. They however have no light from this world, because they are 
above or within the sphere of this light; but their light is from the Lord, who to them is a Sun. Even the midday light of this world is dense darkness to the angels; and when they have an opportunity 
to see it, it is as if they were looking at mere darkness, as I have been given to know by experience. This shows what a difference there is between the light of heaven and the light of this world. </p>

<p>THE LIGHT IN WHICH ANGELS ARE LIVING </p>
<p>Many experiences have made it quite clear to me that spirits and angels possess all of the senses except taste, and that these are far keener and more perfect 
than man's ever are. Not only do angels see and form relationships with one another, experiencing as they do so supreme happiness resulting from mutual love; there are also more things which they 
see in their world than man can ever believe. The world of spirits and the heavens are full of representative phenomena like those seen by the prophets, and so many in number that if a person's sight 
were opened to behold them just for a few hours he would inevitably be dumbfounded. The light in heaven is such as to be unbelievably superior to the light in the physical world at midday. Yet no light 
from this world reaches those who are in heaven since they are above or within the sphere where that light shines; instead they have Light from the Lord, who is their Sun. To angels even the midday 
light of the world is like pitch darkness, and when they are allowed to peer at the light, it is as though they were peering into sheer darkness, as I have been given to know from experience. From this 
it becomes clear how different the light of heaven is from the light of the world. </p>

GENESEOS CAPUT DECIMUM TERTIUM De Luce in qua vivunt Angeli </p>
<p>Quod spiritibus et angelis omnis sensus praeter gustum, multo exquisitior et perfectior sit quam usquam homini, multis mihi manifestatum 
est; se non modo mutuo vident et inter se conversantur angeli in summa felicitate ex amore mutuo, sed etiam plura sunt quae ibi vident quam usquam homo possit credere; est mundus spirituum et sunt 
caeli pleni repraesentativis, qualia visa prophetis, tantis ut si modo aperiretur alicui visus, et per aliquot horas introspiceret, non potuisset non obstupescere. Talis est lux in caelo ut incredibiliter 
superet lucem ipsam meridianam mundi solaris; sed illis nulla est lux ex hoc mundo, quia supra aut intra sphaeram istius lucis sunt, verum est Lux a Domino, Qui illis est Sol. Lux mundi etiam meridiana 
est angelis sicut densa tenebrositas; cum datur illis spectare in lucem illam, est sicut spectarent meras tenebras, quod ab experientia datum scire; inde quae differentia inter lucem caeli et 
lucem mundi sit, constare potest. </p>
