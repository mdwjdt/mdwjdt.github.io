<h3 align="center" class="ired">属天的奥秘 第1878节</h3>
<h4 align="center"></h4><p><strong>1878.</strong>有些灵人在世时藐视圣言，而有些灵人则滥用圣言里的话，甚至拿来当笑料；有些灵人以为圣言无足轻重，但可用来约束普通老百姓；也有些灵人诋毁圣言；还有些灵人亵渎圣言。在来世，所有这些人的命运都是悲惨的，悲惨程度则取决于其藐视、取笑、诋毁和亵渎的性质和程度。因为如前所述，圣言在天堂如此神圣，以至于在那里的人看来，它本身可以说就是天堂。在天堂，所有人的思想都会共享，故这类灵人决不能与他们同在，只能被分离出去。</p>

<p><strong>[NCE]1878.</strong> There are also people who despised the Word during physical life. There are others who misused phrases of Scripture by turning them into mocking jokes. Some considered the Word useless except for its ability to serve as a restraint on the masses. Others blasphemed the Word, and yet others profaned it. The fate of all these people in the next world is wretched, each according to the nature and degree of her or his contempt, derision, blasphemy, or profanation. As noted, the inhabitants of the heavens hold the Word so sacred that it is like heaven to them.{*1} Therefore, because all thoughts are shared generally there, [the two kinds of people] cannot possibly coexist but are separated.<br /><br /><strong>Footnotes:</strong><br />{*1} In this reference to previous statements that angels find the Word so sacred that it is like heaven to them, Swedenborg may be pointing back to his descriptions of the beauty and wonder of the experience of the inner meaning of the Word in the spiritual world as described in <a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_1878/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_1768" target=_top>1768-1772</a>. The same themes are continued in the second installment (of which this section is a part), especially in <a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_1878/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_1869" target=_top>1869-1876</a>. See in particular <a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_1878/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_1771" target=_top>1771</a>, in which spirits in the other world are said to find the power of the Word so great that upon reading it "they seemed to themselves to be lifted up toward the more inward parts of heaven." Compare also <a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_1878/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_1772" target=_top>1772</a>, <a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_1878/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_1875" target=_top>1875</a>. For earlier references to the angels' view of the Word, see <a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_1878/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_64" target=_top>64-65</a>, <a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_1878/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_1025#subsection-2-2" target=_top>1025:2-3</a>, <a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_1878/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_1767" target=_top>1767</a>. However, the angels' reverence is implied rather than explicitly stated in these passages. For later references to this topic in Secrets of Heaven, containing more explicit reference to angels' love of the Word, see <a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_1878/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_2540#subsection-2-2" target=_top>2540:2</a>, <a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_1878/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_2551#subsection-2-2" target=_top>2551:2</a>.

There are also those who in the life of the body had despised the Word; and there are those who had abused the things that are in the Word to give point to a joke. There are those who had supposed that 
the Word was of no account, but that it might serve to keep the common people in some restraint. There are those who had blasphemed the Word; and there are those who had profaned it. The lot in the 
other life of all these persons is miserable, in accordance with the quality and degree of their contempt, derision, blasphemy, and profanation. For, as before said, the Word is so holy in the heavens 
that it is itself as it were heaven to those who are there; and as there exists there a communion of the thoughts of all, such spirits cannot possibly be with them, but are separated. </p>

<p align="center"><b>Elliott(1983-1999) 1878</b></p><p><b>1878.</b>
There are also spirits who during their lifetime regarded the Word with contempt, and there are those who have misused phrases that appear in the Word to make derisive remarks. There are some who imagined 
that the Word was of no importance but that it might serve to keep the common people under some control. There are others who have blasphemed the Word, and there are those who have profaned it. 
The fate of these people in the next life is wretched, depending in each case on the nature and degree of their contempt, derision, blasphemy, or profanation. For, as has been stated, the Word is so holy 
in the heavens that the Word is so to speak heaven to those who are there. Consequently, since a sharing of everyone's thoughts takes place there, the types of spirits that have been mentioned can 
in no way remain there but are set apart from them. </p>

<p align="center"><b>Latin(1748-1756) 1878</b>
</p><b>1878.</b>
Sunt quoque qui in vita corporis contempserunt Verbum; suntque qui illis quae in Verbo pro formulis irrisionis abusi sunt; sunt qui putarunt Verbum nihil esse, sed servire posse pro vulgo ut teneatur 
in quodam vinculo; sunt qui Verbum blasphemarunt; et sunt qui profanarunt: horum sors in alte: vita est miserabilis, cujusvis secundum qualitatem et gradum contemptus, irrisionis, blasphemationis et 
profanationis; nam, ut dictum, Verbum tam sanctum est in caelis, ut iis Verbum sit quasi caelum, quare quia omnium cogitationum datur communio, nusquam possunt simul esse, sed separantur. </p>
