<h4 align="center"></h4><p><strong>927.</strong>“我不再因人的缘故咒诅土地”表人再也不象属上古教会后代之人那样远离了。这一点从前面有关上古教会后代的阐述清楚可知。“咒诅”的内义表远离（参看<a href="223.htm">223</a>，<a href="245.htm">245</a>节）。<br />这里以及下文的情况乃是这样：人再也不象上古教会成员那样远离了，他再也不会如此毁灭自己了。这一点从前面有关上古教会灭绝的后代和被称为“挪亚”的新教会的论述明显可知。也就是说，上古教会成员是这样构成的：意愿和觉知在他里面形成一个心智，即对他来说，爱被植入在其心智的意愿部分，同时居于第二或觉知部分的信也被植入在此。所以，他们的后代继承了合为一体的一个意愿和一个觉知。因此，当我欲和由此产生的疯狂欲望开始占据其意愿部分，也就是之前对主之爱和对邻之仁所在之处时，不仅意愿部分或意愿本身全然败坏，而且觉知部分或觉知本身同时也全然败坏。当最后一代将虚假浸没于其欲望，因而变成“拿非利人（或伟人）”时，更是如此。所以，他们由此变成这类人，即他们无法被复原，因为心智的这两个部分，也就是整个心智已被破坏。<br />然而，主预见这一切，故祂也为人的修复做好了准备，修复的方式如下：人心智的第二部分，即觉知部分能被改造和重生，一个新的意愿，即良知，会被植入到他里面，主经由这个新意愿激发爱或仁之善和信之真。主的神圣慈悲就这样使人复原。这些就是本节“我不再因人的缘故咒诅土地，因为人心的妄想从小就是邪恶，我也再不照我所作的打击一切生物了”所表示的事。</p>

<p><strong>[NCE]927.</strong> I will never again curse the ground on the human being's account means that humanity would no longer turn its back in the way people among the earliest church's descendants had done. This can be seen from earlier statements about the posterity of the earliest church. For the inner-level symbolism of cursing as turning away, see above (<a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_927/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_223" target=_top>223</a>, <a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_927/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_245" target=_top>245</a>).<br />[2] The situation here and in what follows can also be seen from previous descriptions comparing the earliest church's later generations, which perished, with the new church called Noah. (That situation includes the fact that people no longer turned their backs, as members of the earliest church had done, and that they were no longer able to destroy themselves.) As noted in those places [<a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_927/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_310" target=_top>310:1</a>, <a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_927/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_398" target=_top>398</a>, <a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_927/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_640" target=_top>640</a>, <a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_927/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_875#subsection-2-4" target=_top>875:4</a>], the will and intellect of people in the earliest church constituted a single mind. For them, in other words, love was planted in the volitional side, and at the same time so was faith, which filled the second part of the mind, or the intellectual side. Their descendants consequently inherited a will and an intellect that formed a single unit. So when self-love and the mad desires that it spawns started to take over their volitional side, displacing love for the Lord and charity toward their neighbor, it totally corrupted not only the volitional side, or the will, but at the same time the intellectual part, or the intellect. The corruption intensified when the final generation merged falsity with their cravings and by this means became Nephilim.{*1} Having become Nephilim, they could not be salvaged, because their mind on both its sides — that is, their whole mind — was destroyed.<br />[3] But since the Lord foresaw this, he also provided that humankind should be rehabilitated. The means would be an ability to reform and regenerate the second or intellectual part of their mind and to receive in it the seed of a new will. The new will is conscience, through which the Lord puts into action the good urges of love or charity and the true ideas of faith.<br />In this way, by the Lord's divine mercy, humankind was restored.<br />These are the things symbolized in the current verse by I will never again curse the ground on the human being's account, because what human hearts fabricate is evil from their youth. And I will not strike every living thing again as I have done.<br /><br /><strong>Footnotes:</strong><br />{*1} For more on the "Nephilim," see <a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_927/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_581" target=_top>581-583</a> and note 1 in <a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_927/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_554" target=_top>554</a>.

I will not again curse the ground anymore on man's account. That this signifies that man would not anymore so turn away, as did the man of the posterity of the Most Ancient Church, is evident from what 
has been said before about this posterity. That "to curse" signifies in the internal sense to turn oneself away, may be seen above (n. 223, 245). How the case is with this and with what follows: that 
man would not anymore so turn away, as did the man of the Most Ancient Church, and that he would not again be able so to destroy himself, is evident from what has been already said about the posterity 
of the Most Ancient Church who perished, and about the new church which is called "Noah."  [2] It has been shown that the man of the Most Ancient Church was so constituted that the will and understanding 
with him formed one mind, or that with him love was implanted in his will part, and thus at the same time faith, which filled the other or intellectual part of his mind. From this their posterity 
inherited the condition that the will and the understanding made a one; and therefore when the love of self and the consequent insane cupidities began to take possession of their will part (where 
previously there had been love to the Lord and charity toward the neighbor), not only did their will part or will become utterly perverted, but so also together with it did their intellectual part or 
understanding, and this was still more the case when the last posterity immersed their falsities in their cupidities, and so became "Nephilim" for thereby they became of such a nature that they could 
not be restored, because both parts of the mind (that is, the whole mind) had been ruined. But as this had been foreseen by the Lord, He had also provided for man's upbuilding, in this way, that he might 
be reformed and regenerated in respect to the second or intellectual part of the mind, in which there might be implanted a new will which is conscience, and through which the Lord might work the 
good of love (that is, of charity), and the truth of faith. Thus of the Lord's Divine mercy has man been restored. These are the things that are signified in this verse by, "I will not again curse the 
ground anymore on man's account; because the imagination of man's heart is evil from his youth; neither will I smite anymore everything living, as I have done." </p>

<p align="center"><b>Elliott(1983-1999) 927</b></p><p><b>927.</b>
'I will curse the ground no more on account of man' means that never again would man thus turn himself away as the people who belonged to the descendants of the Most Ancient Church had done. This is 
clear from what has been stated already about the descendants of the Most Ancient Church. 'Cursing' in the internal sense means turning oneself away; see what has appeared already in <a href="223.htm">223</a>, <a href="245.htm">245</a>. </p>
<p></p>
<p><b>[2]</b>
The implications of these matters and of those that follow, namely that never again would man thus turn himself away as the member of the Most Ancient Church had done and that he would never again be 
able to destroy himself in that way, also becomes clear from what has been stated already about the descendants of the Most Ancient Church who died out and about the new Church called Noah. That is to 
say, the member of the Most Ancient Church was one in whom will and understanding formed one single mind, that is, with him love was implanted in the will part of his mind, and so at the same time faith, 
which occupied the second or understanding part. Their descendants therefore inherited a will and an understanding that made one. Consequently when self-love and resulting insane desires began to 
take possession of their will part where love to the Lord and charity towards the neighbour had been previously, not only did the will part, or the will itself, at that point become utterly corrupted, 
but so also at the same time did the understanding part, or the understanding itself, all the more so when the final descendants immersed falsities in their desires and in so doing became the Nephilim. 
They became the kind of people therefore for whom no restoration was possible since both parts of their mind, that is, their whole mind, had been ruined.  </p>
<p></p>
<p><b>[3]</b>
 Foreseeing this however, the Lord 
also made provision for mankind to be rehabilitated in the following particular manner: Man could be reformed and regenerated as regards the second part of his mind, the understanding part, and a new 
will, which is conscience, could be implanted in him, by means of which the Lord might stimulate the good that stems from love or charity, and the truth of faith. In this way did the Lord's Divine mercy 
restore man. These are the things meant in this verse by 'I will curse the ground no more on account of man, for the imagination of man's heart is evil from his childhood', and by 'I will no more strike 
every living thing, as I have done'. </p>

</p><b>927.</b>
'Non addam maledicere amplius humo, propter hominem': quod significet quod homo non amplius ita se avertet sicut homo e posteritate Ecclesiae Antiquissimae, constat ab illis quae prius de Antiquissimae 
Ecclesiae posteritate dicta sunt; quod 'maledicere' significet in sensu interno se avertere, videatur prius n. 223, 245. [2] Quomodo haec et sequentia se habent, quod nempe homo se amplius non ita 
avertet sicut homo Antiquissimae Ecclesiae et quod non amplius se perdere poterit, constare etiam potest ab illis quae de Antiquissimae Ecclesiae posteris qui perierunt et de nova Ecclesia quae Noahus 
vocatur, prius dicta sunt; nempe quod Antiquissima Ecclesiae homo talis fuerit quod voluntas et intellectus apud eum unam mentem constituerit, seu quod apud eum amor implantatus fuerit in parte ejus 
voluntaria et sic simul fides quae implebat alteram mentis ejus partem seu intellectualem; posteri eorum ex hereditario inde traxerunt quod voluntas eorum et intellectus unum facerent quare cum amor 
sui et inde vesanae cupiditates occupare coeperunt partem eorum voluntariam, ubi prius amor in Dominum et charitas (x)erga proximum, tunc non solum pars voluntaria seu voluntas prorsus perversa facta 
est, sed etiam simul pars intellectualis seu intellectus eoque magis cum ultima posteritas immersit cupiditatibus falsitate et inde Nephilim facti; inde tales facti ut non restitui possent, quia utraque 
pars mentis eorum seu tota mens destructa fuit.  [3] Sed quia Domino praevisum, etiam provisum est, quod homo exstrueretur, et quidem per id quod homo reformari posset et regenerari quoad alteram ejus 
mentis partem seu intellectualem, ac ei implantari nova voluntas, quae est conscientia, per quam Dominus bonum amori seu charitatis et verum fidei operaretur: ita homo, ex Divina Domini Misericordia, 
restitutus est.  Haec sunt quae significantur in hoc versu per quod 'non addam maledicere amplius humo, propter hominem quia figmentum cordis hominis meum a pueritia,' et quod 'non addam percutere 
omne vivum sicut feci.' </p>
