<h3 align="center" class="ired">属天的奥秘 第1786节</h3>
<h4 align="center"></h4><p><strong>1786.</strong>“异象”表至内在的启示，也就是伴有直觉的事物。这从异象的性质清楚可知，异象是照着人的状态发生的。内层关闭之人所看到的异象完全不同于内层打开之人所看到的。例如：当主在西奈山显现给会众时，这种显现就是一种异象。不过，百姓所看到的这异象不同于亚伦所看到的，而亚伦所看到的不同于摩西所看到的；众先知所看到的又不同于摩西所看到的。异象有很多种，对此，蒙主怜悯，容后再述。异象越完美，就越内在。对主而言，它们是最为完美的，因为那时祂对灵人界和天堂中一切事物有一种直觉，并直接与耶和华交流。这种交流就是耶和华显现给亚伯兰的异象所代表的，就内义而言，也是该异象所表示的。</p>

<p><strong>[NCE]1786.</strong> The fact that a vision is a profound revelation received through perception can be seen from visions, which vary with the visionary's state of mind. A vision is completely different for those whose deeper levels are shut off than for those whose deeper levels are open. When the Lord appeared to the whole congregation on Mount Sinai, for example, his appearance was a vision. The people saw it differently than Aaron, and Aaron differently than Moses. The prophets' visions, furthermore, were different from Moses'. There are many different kinds of visions, which will be discussed later [<a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_1786/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_1882" target=_top>1882-1885</a>, <a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_1786/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_1966" target=_top>1966-1975</a>], the Lord in his divine mercy willing.<br />The deeper a vision is, the fuller it is. The Lord's visionary ability was the most perfect of all, because he then had a perception of everything in the world of spirits and the heavens, and he also had direct communication with Jehovah. This communication is represented and on a deeper level is symbolized by Jehovah's appearing to Abram in a vision. </p>
<p align="center"><b>Potts(1905-1910) 1786</b></p><p><b>1786.</b>
That "a vision" denotes inmost revelation, which is that of perception, may be seen from the nature of visions, which take place in accordance with the man's state. To those whose interiors are closed, 
a vision is very different from what it is to those whose interiors are open. For example: when the Lord appeared to the whole congregation in Mount Sinai, the appearing was a vision that was different 
to the people from what it was to Aaron, and that was different to Aaron from what it was to Moses; and again, visions were different to the prophets from what they were to Moses. There are many 
kinds of visions, concerning which, of the Lord's Divine mercy hereafter. The more interior the visions, the more perfect they are. With the Lord they were the most perfect of all; because He then had 
perception of all things in the world of spirits and in the heavens, and also had immediate communication with Jehovah. This communication is represented, and in the internal sense is signified, by the 
vision in which Jehovah appeared to Abram. </p>

<p align="center"><b>Elliott(1983-1999) 1786</b></p><p><b>1786.</b>
That 'a vision' means inmost revelation, which is an accompaniment of perception, becomes clear from the nature of visions, in that these take shape each one in accordance with the state of the beholder. 
A vision appearing to those whose interiors are closed takes an entirely different shape from a vision to those whose interiors are open. For example, when the Lord appeared to the whole congregation 
on Mount Sinai, that appearing was a vision which was different for the people from what it was for Aaron, and was different for Aaron from what it was for Moses; and a vision for the prophets was 
different again from what it was for Moses. Many kinds of visions are possible, which will in the Lord's Divine mercy be spoken about later on. Visions are more perfect the more interior they are. With 
the Lord they were the most perfect of all, because at that time He had a perception of all things in the world of spirits and in the heavens, and had direct communication with Jehovah. This communication 
is represented, and in the internal sense is meant, by the vision in which Jehovah appeared to Abram. </p>

</p><b>1786.</b>
Quod 'visio' sit intima revelatio quae perceptionis, constare potest a visionibus, quae se habent secundum statum hominis; visio coram illis quibus interiora clausa sunt, prorsus aliter se habet ac 
visio coram illis quibus interiora aperta; ut pro exemplo, cum Dominus apparuit toti congregationi in Monte Sinai, apparitio illa fuit visi' quae alia fuit populo quam Aharoni, et alia Aharoni quam Mosi, 
porro alia visio fuit prophetis quam Mosi.  Visionum dantur plures species, de quibus, ex Divina Domini Misericordia, in sequentibus: visiones eo perfectiores sunt quo interiores; apud Dominum omnium 
perfectissima fuit, quia Ipsi tunc perceptio omnium quae in mundo spirituum et in caelis, et Ipsi cum Jehovah immediata communicatio; haec communicatio per visionem in qua apparuit Jehovah Abramo, 
repraesentatur, et in sensu interno significatur. </p>
