<h3 align="center" class="ired">属天的奥秘 第505节</h3>
<h4 align="center"></h4><p><strong>505.</strong>如前所述，以挪士是第三个教会，仍是上古教会之一。但不如“塞特”教会那么属天，因而直觉稍逊。反过来，被称为“塞特”的教会又不如被称为“亚当”的母教会那么属天和有直觉。构成上古教会的这三个教会，相对于后续教会而言，是果实的核或种子，而后续教会比较象它们的膜。</p>

<p><strong>[NCE]505.</strong> Enosh, as noted, is the third church, one of the primeval ones but less heavenly and as a result less perceptive than the church Seth, which in turn was not as heavenly and perceptive as the church that gave it birth, called "the human."<br />These three are the churches that constitute the earliest church. They are like the pit of a fruit or the germ of a seed in relation to the churches that followed. These later churches resemble the outer layers of a fruit or seed by comparison. </p>
<p align="center"><b>Potts(1905-1910) 505</b></p><p><b>505.</b>
"Enosh" as before observed, is a third church, yet one of the most ancient churches, but less celestial, and consequently less perceptive, than the church "Seth;" and this latter was not so celestial 
and perceptive as the parent church, called "Man." These three are what constitute the Most Ancient Church, which, relatively to the succeeding ones, was as the kernel of fruits, or seeds, whereas the 
succeeding churches are relatively as the membranaceous parts of these. </p>

<p align="center"><b>Elliott(1983-1999) 505</b></p><p><b>505.</b>
As has been stated, Enosh is a third Church, one of the Most Ancient Churches. But it was less celestial and so less perceptive than the Church of Seth, which in turn was not so celestial or perceptive 
as the parent Church called Man had been. These three constituting the Most Ancient Church were, in relation to those that followed, like the kernel of fruit or seeds, whereas the Churches that followed 
were relatively like their outer coverings.  </p>

<p align="center"><b>Latin(1748-1756) 505</b>
</p><b>505.</b>
Enosh est, ut dictum, tertia Ecclesia, una Antiquissimarum, sed minus caelestis, proinde minus perceptiva, quam Ecclesia 'Sheth,' et haec non ita caelestis ac perceptiva sicut Ecclesia parens 'Homo' 
dicta. Hae tres sunt quae constituunt Antiquissimam; quasi nucleum fructuum aut seminum respective ad sequentes, sequentes autem naturam membranaceam illorum respective referunt. </p>
