<h3 align="center" class="ired">属天的奥秘 第8593节</h3>
<h4 align="center"></h4><p><strong>8593.</strong>“并且亚玛力来”表内层邪恶所生的虚假。这从“亚玛力”的含义清楚可知，“亚玛力”是指由内层邪恶所产生的虚假，如下文所述。首先必须说明，究竟是谁沉浸于内层邪恶所生的虚假，他们是什么样的人。内层邪恶就是与人同在、藏在里面的邪恶。它藏在他的意愿，由此藏在他的思维中，而在他的外在，如在他的言行和脸上却没有显出一丝痕迹。陷入这种邪恶的人用各种方法和技巧试图把它藏起来，把它秘藏在高尚正义的外表，以及爱邻舍的外表之下。然而，他们在自己里面只想着如何造成伤害，并且尽可能地利用其他人造成伤害，小心翼翼地防止任何人看出他们才是唆使者。他们还将邪恶本身涂上色彩，好叫它看上去不像邪恶。他们生活的最大乐趣就是深思这些事，试图暗中行出来。这就是所谓的内层邪恶。那些陷入这种邪恶的人被称为“恶魔”，在来世与那些陷入外层邪恶，被称为“灵人”的人完全分离。前者，即恶魔在人后面，也就是人的背后有他们的地狱，在那里住在各种洞穴中；但恶灵在人前面，也就是在两边有他们的地狱。在大人里面，这些魔怪属于小脑区域，也属于发出控制无意识行为的纤维和神经的脊髓部位。<br />论到由这内层邪恶所生的虚假，可以进一步说：它不像由恶灵所拥有的邪恶产生的虚假，因为它本身就是邪恶。那些陷入这种邪恶的人不会攻击信之真理，但会攻击信之良善。他们通过败坏情感行事，由此扭曲良善的思维，并且以一种几乎难以想象的方式而如此行。由于他们具有这种性质，所以他们的地狱与恶灵的地狱彻底分离，并且分离得如此彻底，以致他们几乎没有任何接触；他们被分离是为了叫他们也能与属灵教会成员分离。因为如果他们真的从他们的地狱流入，属灵教会成员就全完了，因为他们会以一种极为隐秘的方式作用于他的良知，并且会扭曲它，这一切是通过膨胀他的败坏情感而做到的。这些地狱魔怪从不公开攻击一个人，当这个人能进行强烈抵抗时，也不公开攻击；但当看上去此人就要跌倒，以至于可能会屈服时，他们突然就在眼前，并推他一把，使他彻底跌倒。这一切也由以下事实来代表：亚玛力现在上来攻击以色列；以及后来当以色列人反对耶和华，害怕迦南地的列族时：<br />于是亚玛力和迦南人都从那山上下来，他们击杀以色列人，直到何珥玛。（民数记<a href="http://39-27.cn/民14.45.htm">14:45</a>）<br />由此可见亚玛力所代表的人是何性质，又为何耶和华对亚玛力的审判是：要永远和他们争战，对他们的记忆要从天堂下面抹去，正如在本章最后一节中经上所说的这些话：<br />因为恶人的手攻击耶的宝座，耶和华必世世代代和亚玛力争战。（出埃及记<a href="http://39-27.cn/出17.16.htm">17:16</a>）<br />申命记：<br />你要记念你们出埃及的时候，亚玛力在路上怎样待你。他在路上遇见你，趁你疲乏困倦，击杀你后边所有软弱的人，并不敬畏神。所以，耶和华你神使你得享安息。那时，你要将对亚玛力的记忆从天下涂抹了，不可忘记。（申命记<a href="http://39-27.cn/申25.17.htm">25:17</a>-<a href="http://39-27.cn/申25.19.htm">19</a>）<br />撒母耳记：<br />耶和华通过撒母耳对扫罗说，以色列人出埃及的时候，亚玛力向他所行的，就是亚玛力在路上怎样反对他，我已决定惩罚。现在你要去击打亚玛力，灭尽他所有的，不可怜惜他们，将男女、孩童、吃奶的，并牛、羊、骆驼和驴尽行杀死。扫罗却怜惜亚甲王，也爱惜上好的羊群、牛群、肥畜、公羊并一切肥美物。于是就谴责扫罗说，他因此将不再作以色列的王。（撒母耳记上<a href="http://39-27.cn/撒上15.1.htm">15:1</a>-<a href="http://39-27.cn/撒上15.3.htm">3</a>，<a href="http://39-27.cn/撒上15.9.htm">9</a>，<a href="http://39-27.cn/撒上15.23.htm">23</a>，<a href="http://39-27.cn/撒上15.26.htm">26</a>）<br />“对亚玛力的记忆涂抹了”，以及“他所有的都灭尽”表示恶魔与那些属于属灵教会的人不会有任何接触；因为他们与那些未处于真理，而是出于邪恶的情感支持虚假的人相接触。<br />谁看不出，没有一个深藏的原因，耶和华永远不会说要永远和亚玛力争战，要将对亚玛力的记忆从天下涂抹了，他所有的都灭尽，尽管这一切其实都未发生。说并做这些事的深藏原因就包含在扫罗对他所怜惜的亚玛力王亚甲所说的话里：<br />亚甲就欢欢喜喜地走到撒母耳面前；撒母耳说，你的剑怎样使妇人丧子，你母亲就怎样在妇人中也必丧子。于是，扫罗在耶和华面前将亚甲砍碎了。（撒母耳记上<a href="http://39-27.cn/撒上15.32.htm">15:32</a>，<a href="http://39-27.cn/撒上15.33.htm">33</a>）<br />“欢欢喜喜地走”表示这类灵人在别人面前的迷人外表；“你的剑怎样使妇人丧子”表示这些灵人的虚假向良善的情感施暴；“你母亲就怎样在妇人中也必丧子”表示源于意愿，而非理解力的邪恶情感将在他们当中占主导地位；“扫罗在耶和华面前将亚甲砍碎”表示他们与那些陷入源于理解力的邪恶所生的虚假之人分离，也就是说，恶魔与灵人分离，如前所述。“妇人”表示情感（参看<a href="568.htm">568</a>，<a href="6014.htm">6014</a>，<a href="8337.htm">8337</a>节），“剑”表示争战和荒废的虚假（<a href="2799.htm">2799</a>，<a href="4499.htm">4499</a>，<a href="7102.htm">7102</a>节）。</p>

<p align="center"><b>Potts(1905-1910) 8593</b></p><p><b>8593.</b>
And Amalek came. That this signifies falsity from interior evil, is evident from the signification of "Amalek," as being the falsity from interior evil (of which below). It is first to be told who and 
what they are who are in falsity from interior evil. Interior evil is that which lies inwardly concealed with man, hidden in his will, and thence in his thought, no trace of which appears in his externals, 
as in his actions, speech, and face. They who are in such evil study by every method and art to hide and hoard it under the semblance of what is honorable and just, and under the semblance of 
the love of the neighbor; yet still they devise nothing else within themselves than how they can inflict evil, and so far as they can they do inflict evil by means of others, taking care that it should 
not appear to be from them; they also color over the evil itself, that it may not seem like evil. The greatest delight of their life is to meditate such things, and to attempt them in concealment. This 
is called interior evil. They who are in this evil are called "evil genii," and in the other life are completely separated from those who are in exterior evil, and who are called "spirits." The evil 
genii have their hell behind man, that is, at his back, and are there in various caverns; but evil spirits have their hell before man, and also at the sides. In the Grand Man these genii belong to 
the province of the cerebellum, and also to that part of the spinal marrow which sends forth fibers and nerves to the involuntary parts. [2] As further concerning the falsity from this evil-it is not 
like the falsity from the evil of evil spirits, for in itself it is evil. They who are in this evil do not attack the truths of faith, but the goods of faith; for they act by means of depraved affections, 
whereby they pervert good thoughts, and this in a manner almost incomprehensible. Because they are of such a nature, their hells are completely separated from the hells of evil spirits, insomuch 
that they have scarcely any communication, and this for the reason that they may be separated from the men of the spiritual church; for if they were to flow in from their hells, it would be all over 
with the man of that church, because they would act in the most hidden manner into his conscience and would pervert it, and this by the breathing in of depraved affections. These infernal genii never 
attack a man openly, nor when he is capable of vigorous resistance; but when it appears that a man is falling so as to yield, they are then suddenly at hand, and push him on to a complete fall. This too 
is represented by the fact that Amalek now fell upon Israel; and also afterward, when the sons of Israel had set themselves in opposition to Jehovah, and were afraid of the nations in the land of Canaan: </p>
<p> 
    Then Amalek came down with the Canaanite from the mountain, and they smote the sons of Israel even unto Hormah (Num. 14:45). [3] From all this it can be seen what is the quality of those 
who are represented by Amalek, and why the judgment came upon Amalek from Jehovah that there should be perpetual war against them, and that the memory of them should be blotted out from under heaven, 
according to these words in the last verse of this chapter: </p>
<p>     Because the hand of the evil is against the throne of Jah, there shall be war to Jehovah against Amalek from generation to generation 
(Exod. 17:16). And in Deuteronomy: </p>
<p>     Remember what Amalek did to thee by the way, when thou camest forth out of Egypt; that he met thee in the way, and smote the hindmost in thee, all that were 
feeble, when thou wast faint and weary, and he feared not God; when Jehovah thy God shall have given thee rest, thou shalt blot out the memory of Amalek from under heaven; thou shalt not forget (Deut. 
25:17-19). Also in the first book of Samuel, where it is said by Jehovah through Samuel unto Saul: </p>
<p>     I have resolved to visit that which Amalek did to Israel, who laid wait for him in the way, when 
he was coming up out of Egypt; wherefore go and smite Amalek, and give to the curse all things which are his, and spare them not; but slay from man even to woman, from infant even to suckling, from 
ox even to small cattle, from camel even to ass. But Saul spared king Agag, and the best of the flock, and of the oxen, and the second sort, and the rams, and all that was excellent; </p>
<p>and so it was 
denounced against Saul that from him there should no more be a king over Israel (1 Sam. 15:1-3, 9, 23, 26). That "the memory of Amalek was to be blotted out," and that "all things with him were to be 
given to the curse," signified that evil genii should have no communication whatever with those who are of the spiritual church; for they communicate with those who are not in truths, but who favor falsities 
from evil affection. [4] Who cannot see that without a cause that lies deeply concealed Jehovah would never have said that "there should be perpetual war against Amalek," and that "the memory 
of them should be blotted out from under heaven," and that "all things with him should be given to the curse," and that nevertheless this was not done. The deeply hidden reason why these things were 
said and done, is involved in the words of Samuel to Agag the king of the Amalekites, whom Saul spared: </p>
<p>     Agag the king of Amalek came unto Samuel delicately; but Samuel said, As thy sword hath bereaved 
women, so shall thy mother be bereaved beyond women; and Samuel hewed him in pieces before Jehovah (1 Sam. 15:32, 33). "To go delicately" signifies the outward blandishments of such spirits in 
the presence of others; "thy sword hath bereaved women" signifies that the falsity of these spirits inflicts violence on good affections; "thy mother shall be bereaved beyond women" signifies that with 
them will prevail evil affection from the will, and not from the intellectual part; "and Samuel hewed him in pieces before Jehovah" signifies that they were separated from those who are in falsity 
from evil from the intellectual part; thus genii from spirits (as said above). (That "women" denote affections, see n. 568, 6014, 8337; and that "a sword" denotes falsity combating and vastating, n. 
2799, 4499, 7102.) </p>

<p align="center"><b>Elliott(1983-1999) 8593</b></p><p><b>8593.</b>
'And Amalek came' means falsity arising from interior evil. This is clear from the representation of 'Amalek' as falsity arising from interior evil, dealt with below. Who exactly are steeped in falsity 
arising from interior evil, and what they are like, must be stated first. Interior evil is that which resides with a person, hidden inwardly. It is concealed in his will and consequently in his thinking, 
not a trace of it being apparent outwardly, in his actions, speech, or face. People ruled by this kind of evil strive by every method and skill to hide it away, to conceal it under an outward show 
of being honourable and righteous, and an outward show of love of the neighbour. Nevertheless their only thought is how to inflict harm, and so far as possible to use others to inflict it, taking 
care to prevent anyone from seeing that they are the instigators. They also disguise actual evil so that it does not look like evil. The greatest delight of their life is to contemplate such things and 
secretly try to carry them out. This is called interior evil. Those ruled by this evil are called evil genii and in the next life they have been completely separated from those who are ruled by exterior 
evil and are called spirits. The former - the evil genii - have their hell behind a person, that is, behind his back, where they live in various caverns. But the evil spirits have their hell in front 
of a person, and also to the sides. The genii belong in the Grand Man to the province of the cerebellum, and also to that part of the spinal cord which sends out the fibres and nerves that control 
involuntary actions. </p>
<p></p>
<p><b>[2]</b>
 One may say further of the falsity arising from this interior evil that it is not like the falsity arising from evil that the evil spirits possess, because it is in itself 
evil. Those ruled by this evil do not attack the truths of faith but forms of the good of faith. They act through corrupt affections; through these they pervert good thoughts, doing so in a way almost 
inconceivable. Because they are like this their hells are completely separated from the hells of evil spirits, so completely that they have scarcely any contact with them; and they are separated in 
order that they may also be separated from members of the spiritual Church. For if they were to flow in from their hells, the member of that Church would be destroyed because they would act very secretly 
on his conscience and would pervert it, which they would do by inflating his corrupt affections. Those hellish genii never attack a person openly, or when he can offer strong resistance, but when 
it is seen that the person is slipping and may therefore give in. At this point they are suddenly at hand, and give him a shove so that he falls completely. This is also represented by Amalek's coming 
up to attack Israel now, as well as at a later time when the children of Israel set themselves against Jehovah and were afraid of the nations in the land of Canaan, </p>
<blockquote>
Then also Amalek came down with 
the Canaanite from the mountain, and struck down the children of Israel as far as Hormah. <a href="http://bible.gospelcom.net/cgi-bin/bible?passage=Num%2014:43,%2045&amp;version=ESV&amp;interface=print&amp;showfn=yes&amp;showxref">Num 14:43, 45</a>. 
</blockquote>
<p></p>
<p><b>[3]</b>
 From all this one may recognize what those people are like who are represented by Amalek, 
and the reason for the judgement pronounced over him by Jehovah that war will be waged against them forever and that the memory of them will be wiped out from under heaven, in accordance with the 
following words in the final verse of the present chapter, </p>
<p>Because the hand of the evil ones is against the throne of Jah, the war of Jehovah will be against Amalek from generation to generation. </p>
<p>And 
in Deuteronomy, </p>
<blockquote>
Remember what Amalek did to you on the way when you came out of Egypt, that he met you on the way, and cut off at your rear all the weak, when you were tired and weary; he did 
not fear God When Jehovah your God has given you rest, you shall wipe out the memory of Amalek from under heaven; you shall not forget. <a href="http://bible.gospelcom.net/cgi-bin/bible?passage=Deut%2025:17-19&amp;version=ESV&amp;interface=print&amp;showfn=yes&amp;showxref">Deut 25:17-19</a>. 
</blockquote>
<p>Also in the first book of Samuel, </p>
<blockquote>
Jehovah 
declared to Saul through Samuel, I have resolved to punish<A name="fntext1"></a><A href="#fn1"><sup>a</sup></a> what Amalek did to Israel, how he set [himself] against him on the way when he came up from Egypt. Therefore go and strike Amalek, and utterly 
destroy all that he has; do not spare him, but kill man and woman, infant and suckling, ox and sheep, camel and ass. But Saul spared Agag the king, and the best of the flock and the oxen, and of 
the fatlings,<A name="fntext2"></a><A href="#fn2"><sup>b</sup></a> and the rams, and all that was good. Therefore it was declared to Saul that because of this he would no longer be king over Israel. <a href="http://bible.gospelcom.net/cgi-bin/bible?passage=1%20Sam%2015:2,%203,%209,%2023&amp;version=ESV&amp;interface=print&amp;showfn=yes&amp;showxref">1 Sam 15:2, 3, 9, 23</a>. 
</blockquote>
<p>The declaration that the memory 
of Amalek should be wiped out and that everything there should be utterly destroyed meant that evil genii should have no contact whatever with those belonging to the spiritual Church; for they are 
in contact with those who are not governed by truths but from an evil affection uphold falsities. </p>
<p></p>
<p><b>[4]</b>
 Who can fail to see that except for some more deeply hidden reason Jehovah would never have 
said that war was to be waged forever against Amalek, that the memory of him was to be wiped out from under heaven, and that everything there was to be utterly destroyed, though all this was not in fact 
carried out? That more deeply hidden reason why these things were said and done is embodied in Samuel's words to Agag the king of the Amalekites, whom Saul had spared, </p>
<blockquote>
Agag the king of Amalek went 
to Samuel delicately.<A name="fntext3"></a><A href="#fn3"><sup>c</sup></a> But Samuel said, As your sword has bereaved women, so shall your mother become the most bereaved of women. And Samuel cut him in pieces before Jehovah. <a href="http://bible.gospelcom.net/cgi-bin/bible?passage=1%20Sam%2015:32,%2033&amp;version=ESV&amp;interface=print&amp;showfn=yes&amp;showxref">1 Sam 15:32, 33</a>. 
</blockquote>
<p>'Going 
delicately' means the outwardly charming ways that such people have in the presence of others. 'Your sword has bereaved women' means that their falsity does violence to good affections; 'your 
mother shall become the most bereaved of women' means that evil affection which originates in the will, not in the understanding, will hold sway among them; 'and Samuel cut him in pieces before Jehovah' 
means that they were separated from those ruled by falsity arising from evil that originated in the understanding, that is, genii were separated from spirits, as stated above. For the meaning of 'women' 
as affections, see <a href="568.htm">568</a> <a href="6014.htm">6014</a>, <a href="8337.htm">8337</a>; and for 'sword' as falsity engaged in conflict and laying waste, <a href="2799.htm">2799</a>, <a href="4499.htm">4499</a>, <a href="7102.htm">7102</a>.

`Et venit Amalek': quod significet falsum ex interiore malo, constat ex repraesentatione `Amaleki' quod sit falsum ex interiore malo, de qua sequitur.  Quinam et quales (t)illi sunt qui in falso ex 
interiore malo {1}, {2}primum dicetur: interius malum (x)est quod intus latet apud hominem, reconditum in ejus voluntate et inde in cogitatione, nec ejus vestigium apparet in externis, ut in actionibus, 
in loquela, inque facie; qui in tali malo sunt student omni modo et arte occultare illud (c)et recondere sub specie honesti et justi, et sub specie {3}amoris proximi'; et usque apud se non aliud cogitant 
quam ut possint malum inferre, et quantum possunt per alios inferunt, cavendo tunc ne appareat quod ab illis; ipsum etiam malum infucant, ut non videatur sicut malum; jucundissimum vitae illorum 
est talia meditari et in occulto moliri; hoc dicitur malum interius; qui in hoc malo sunt vocantur mali genii, et in altera vita prorsus separati sunt ab illis qui in malo exteriore, et vocantur spiritus; 
illi, nempe mali genii, infernum suum habent post hominem, hoc est, ad tergum ejus, ac ibi in variis cavernis, at mali spiritus infernum habent ante hominem, et quoque ad latera; genii illi in 
Maximo Homine pertinent ad provinciam cerebelli, et quoque ad illam partem medullae spinalis quae emittit fibras et nervos ad involuntaria. 	2 Quod ulterius falsum ex hoc malo attinet, non est sicut 
falsum ex malo malorum spirituum, {5}nam in se est malum; qui in hoc malo sunt non aggrediuntur vera fidei sed bona fidei; agunt enim per affectiones pravas, per quas pervertunt cogitationes bonas, et 
hoc modo paene incomprehensibili; hi quia tales sunt, inferna illorum prorsus separantur ab infernis spirituum malorum, adeo ut {6}vix communicationem habeant, {7}et hoc ob causam ut separentur ab hominibus 
Ecclesiae spiritualis, nam si ab infernis suis influerent, actum foret {8}de homine istius Ecclesiae, agerent enim occultissime in conscientiam et illam perverterent, et hoc per pravarum affectionum 
insufflationes; infernales illi genii nusquam aggrediuntur aperte hominem, nec cum est in vigore resistendi, sed cum apparet {9} quod homo in lapsu sit ut succumbat, tunc subito praesto sunt, et 
impellunt ut prorsus cadat; hoc quoque repraesentatur per quod Amalek nunc invaserit Israelem; et quoque postea, cum filii Israelis opposuerunt se Jehovae, et timuerunt pro gentibus in terra {10}Canaane, Descendit 
etiam tunc Amalek {11}cum Canaanita {12}e monte, et percusserunt filios Israelis usque ad (x)Chormam, Num. xiv 43, 45. 	3 Ex his constare potest quales sunt qui repraesentantur per `Amalekum,' 
et cur judicium super {13}illum a Jehovah, quod bellum erit contra illos perpetuo, et quod delebitur memoria illorum de sub caelo, secundum haec in ultimo versu hujus capitis, Quia manus {14}malorum 
contra thronum Jah, bellum Jehovae erit in Amalekum a generatione in generationem: </p>
<p>et in Deuteronomio, Memento quod fecit tibi Amalek in via cum exivisti ex Aegypto, quod occurrerit tibi 
in via, et decaudaverit in te omnes infirmos, cum tu fessus et lassus, nec timuit Deum; cum quietem dederit tibi Jehovah Deus tuus, delebis memoriam Amaleki de sub caelo; non oblivisceris, xxv 17-19: </p>
<p>{15}tum 
in Libro 1 Samuelis, Dictum est a Jehovah per {16}Schemuelem Schaulo, Visitare constitui quod fecit Amalek Israeli, qui posuit huic in via cum ascenderet ex Aegypto; quare abi et percute Amalekum, 
et devotioni da omnia quae illi, nec parcas illi, sed occidas a viro usque ad mulierem, ab infante usque ad lactentem, a bove usque ad pecudem, a camelo usque ad asinum.  Sed Schaul pepercit regi 
Agago, et opimis gregis et boum, et secundae {17}sortis, et arietibus, et omni egregio; {18}ideo denuntiatum est Schaulo, quod ex illo non amplius esset rex super Israelem, {19}xv 2, 3, 9, 23; </p>
<p>quod 
deleretur memoria Amaleki, (c)ac devotioni darentur omnia quae ibi, significabat quod prorsus non communicarent {20}genii mali cum illis qui ab Ecclesia spirituali, nam communicant cum illis qui non 
in veris sunt, sed falsis favent ex affectione mala. 	4 Quis non videre potest quod Jehovah, absque causa quae altius {21}latet, nusquam dixerit quod bellum esset {22}in Amalekum in perpetuum, et quod 
deleretur memoria illius de sub caelo, quodque {23}omnia quae ibi devotioni darentur; et quod usque tamen hoc non factum sit?  Causa illa quae altius latuit, cur illa dicta sunt et {24} facta, involvitur 
in verbis Schemuelis ad Agagum regem Amalekitarum, cui pepercit Schaul, Agagus rex Amaleki ivit ad Schemuelem in deliciis; sed dixit Schemuel, Quemadmodum orbavit mulieres gladius tuus, ita orba
