<h3 align="center" class="ired">属天的奥秘 第2701节</h3>
<h4 align="center"></h4><p><strong>2701.</strong>“神开了夏甲的眼”表聪明。之 从“开”、“神开了”和“眼”的含义清楚可知，“开了眼”是指赋予聪明（<a href="212.htm">212</a>节），和“看见”或“观看”一样（参看<a href="2150.htm">2150</a>，<a href="2325.htm">2325</a>节）。当神打开内视或理解力时，经上就说“神开了眼”；这种打开是通过进入人心智的理性，确切地说，进入其理性的属灵部分的流注实现的。这种流注所取的途径就是灵魂，即内在途径，而此人自己则对此全然不知。该流注就是他的启示状态，在此状态下，他所听闻或阅读的真理通过一种从内存在于其心智理解力部分中的直觉而向他确认。这个人本人则以为这种启示天生就在他里面，是从他自己的理解力发出的。但在这一点上，他大错特错了。因为这种启示就是一种流注，该流注从主经由天堂进入人所具有的昏昧、错误和似是而非之物，并通过其中的良善使他所相信的事物变得与真理相仿。不过，只有那些属灵之人才有在信的属灵事物上被启示的赐福。这就是“神开了眼”这句话的含义。<br />“眼”表理解力，这是因为肉体的视觉对应于其灵的视觉，而灵的视觉就是理解力。由于它具有这样的对应关系，故在圣言中，眼在几乎所有提及它的地方，甚至人们以为它表示其它东西的地方，都表示理解力。如主在马太福音中所说这些话的地方：<br />眼睛就是身上的灯。你的眼睛若康健，全身就都光明；你的眼睛若昏花，全身就都黑暗。你里头的光若黑暗了，那黑暗是何等大呢！（马太福音<a href="http://39-27.cn/太6.22.htm">6:22</a>-<a href="http://39-27.cn/太6.23.htm">23</a>；路加福音<a href="http://39-27.cn/路11.34.htm">11:34</a>）<br />此处“眼睛”是指理解力，其属灵成分就是信。这一点从此处的补充说明也能明显看出来，即：“你里头的光若黑暗了，那黑暗是何等大呢”。同样在该福音书：<br />若是你的右眼使你跌倒，剜出它来，从你身上扔掉。（马太福音<a href="http://39-27.cn/太5.29.htm">5:29</a>；<a href="http://39-27.cn/太18.9.htm">18:9</a>）<br />“左眼”是指心智的理解力部分，而“右眼”是指其情感。要剜出右眼表示若这情感叫人跌倒，它必须被制服。<br />同一福音书：<br />你们的眼睛是有福的，因为它们看得见；你们的耳朵也是有福的，因为它们听得见。（马太福音<a href="http://39-27.cn/太13.16.htm">13:16</a>）<br />路加福音：<br />耶稣对门徒说，看见你们所看见的，那眼睛就有福了。（路加福音<a href="http://39-27.cn/路10.23.htm">10:23</a>）<br />此处“看见的眼睛”表聪明和信仰，因为他们看见主，以及看见祂的神迹和作为并不能使他们被赐福，有福的是他们能以其理解力理解这些事，并有信，这才是“用眼看”所表示的；而他们的顺从则是“用耳听”所表示的。至于“用眼看”是指理解力，以及有信，可参看前文（<a href="897.htm">897</a>，<a href="2325.htm">2325</a>节）。因为理解力是视觉的属灵补足物（spiritual complement of sight），而信则是理解力的属灵补足物（spiritual complement of sight）。肉眼的视觉来自尘世之光，而信的视觉来自天堂之光。因此，日常对话中会说到“理解地看待”（seeing with the understanding）、“带着信心去看”（seeing by faith）。“用耳听”是指顺从（参看<a href="2542.htm">2542</a>节）。<br />马可福音：<br />耶稣对门徒说，你们还不省悟，还不明白吗？你们的心还是愚顽吗？你们有眼睛，看不见吗？有耳朵，听不见吗？（马可福音<a href="http://39-27.cn/可8.17.htm">8:17</a>-<a href="http://39-27.cn/可8.18.htm">18</a>）<br />此处很明显，“有眼睛却看不见”表示不愿去理解，也不相信。路加福音：<br />耶稣论及这城说，巴不得你知道关系你平安的事；无奈现在这事在你眼前是隐藏的。（路加福音<a href="http://39-27.cn/路19.41.htm">19:41</a>-<a href="http://39-27.cn/路19.42.htm">42</a>）<br />马可福音：<br />这是主所作的，在我们眼中看为希奇。（马可福音<a href="http://39-27.cn/可12.11.htm">12:11</a>）<br />此处“在你眼前是隐藏的”和“在眼中看为希奇”表对于理解力来说，就是如此。这是每个人从“眼睛”在日常用语中的含义所知道的。</p>

God opened her eyes. That this signifies intelligence, is evident from the signification of "opening" and of "God opening," and also of "eyes" as being to give intelligence (that "eyes" signify the understanding 
may be seen above, n. 212, in like manner as "sight" or "seeing," n. 2150, 2325). It is said that "God opens the eyes" when He opens the interior sight or understanding; which is effected 
by an influx into man's rational, or rather into the spiritual of his rational. This is done by the way of the soul, or the internal way, unknown to the man. This influx is his state of enlightenment, 
in which the truths which he hears or reads are confirmed to him by a kind of perception interiorly within his intellectual. This the man believes to be innate in him, and to proceed from his own intellectual 
faculty; but in this he is very much mistaken; for it is an influx through heaven from the Lord into what is obscure, fallacious, and seeming with the man, which by means of the good therein 
causes the things which he believes to be similar to truth. But they only who are spiritual are blessed with enlightenment in the spiritual things of faith. It is this which is signified by "God opening 
the eyes." [2] That the "eye" signifies the understanding is because the sight of the body corresponds to the sight of its spirit, which is the understanding; and because it corresponds, in the 
Word the understanding is signified by the "eye" in almost every place where it is mentioned, even where it is believed to be otherwise; as where the Lord says in Matthew: </p>
<p>     The light of the body 
is the eye; if therefore thine eye be single, thy whole body shall be full of light; but if thine eye be evil, thy whole body shall be full of darkness; if therefore the light that is in thee be darkness, 
how great is that darkness (Matt. 6:22-23; Luke 11:34). Here the "eye" is the understanding, the spiritual of which is faith, as also is evident from the explication: "if therefore the light that 
is in thee be darkness, how great is that darkness." So too in the same: </p>
<p>     If thy right eye causeth thee to stumble, pluck it out, and cast it from thee (Matt. 5:29; 18:9). The "left eye" is the 
intellectual, but the "right eye" is its affection: that the right eye is to be plucked out means that the affection is to be subdued if it causes stumbling. [3] In the same: </p>
<p>     Blessed are your 
eyes, for they see, and your ears, for they hear (Matt. 13:16); </p>
<p>and in Luke: </p>
<p>     Jesus said to the disciples, Blessed are the eyes which see the thing which ye see (Luke 10:23). Here by the "eyes 
which see," intelligence and faith are signified; for their seeing the Lord, and also His miracles and works, did not make them blessed; but comprehending them with the understanding and having faith, 
which is "seeing with the eyes;" and obeying, which is "hearing with the ears." That to "see with the eyes" is to understand, and also to have faith, may be seen above (n. 897, 2325) for the understanding 
is the spiritual of the sight, and faith is the spiritual of the understanding. The sight of the eye is from the light of the world, but the sight of faith is from the light of heaven. Hence it 
is common to speak of seeing with the understanding, and of seeing by faith. (That to "hear with the ear" is to obey, may be seen above, n. 2542.) [4] Also in Mark: </p>
<p>     Jesus said to the disciples, 
Do ye not yet perceive, neither understand? Have ye your heart yet hardened? Having eyes see ye not? And having ears hear ye not? (Mark 8:17-18); </p>
<p>where it is manifest that not to be willing to understand 
and not to believe, is to "have eyes and not see." In Luke: </p>
<p>     Jesus said of the city, If thou hadst known the things that belong unto thy peace; but now it is hid from thine eyes (Luke 19:41-42). And 
in Mark: </p>
<p>     This is the Lord's doing, and it is marvelous in our eyes (Mark 12:11); </p>
<p>where to be "hid from the eyes," and to be "marvelous in the eyes," means to be so to the understanding, 
as is known to everyone from the signification of the eye even in the common use of language. </p>

<p align="center"><b>Elliott(1983-1999) 2701</b></p><p><b>2701.</b>
'God opened her eyes' means intelligence. This is clear from the meaning of 'opening' - and that it is God who did so - and also from [the meaning] of 'the eyes', as conferring intelligence; for 'the 
eyes' means the understanding, see <a href="212.htm">212</a>, as also does 'sight' or 'seeing', <a href="2150.htm">2150</a>, <a href="2325.htm">2325</a>. The expression 'God opens the eyes' is used when He opens interior sight or the understanding, which opening is accomplished 
by means of an influx into the rational part of the person's mind, or rather into the spiritual part of his rational. The route taken by this influx is the soul, that is, the internal route, 
of which the person himself is not aware. This influx is his state of enlightenment in which the truths he hears or reads about are confirmed for him by a kind of perception existing within, in the 
understanding part of his mind. The person himself believes that this enlightenment is innate within himself and that it springs from his own power of understanding; but in this he is very much mistaken. 
This enlightenment consists in an influx from the Lord by way of heaven into that person's dim, mistaken, and specious sight of things, and by means of the good there causes the things which he believes 
to become imitations of truth. Only those who are spiritual however are blessed with enlightenment in spiritual matters of faith; and this is the meaning of the expression 'God opens the eyes'. </p>
<p></p>
<p><b>[2]</b>
The reason why 'the eye' means the understanding is that the sight belonging to the body corresponds to that belonging to its spirit, which is the understanding. And because it has this correspondence 
'the eye' in the Word, in almost every place where it is mentioned, means the understanding, even where people believe something other is meant, as where the Lord says in Matthew, </p>
<blockquote>
The lamp 
of the body is the eye. If the eye is sound, the whole body is full of light. If the eye has been evil the whole body has been made full of darkness. If therefore the light is darkness, how great is 
the darkness! <a href="http://bible.gospelcom.net/cgi-bin/bible?passage=Matt%206:%2022,%2023&amp;version=ESV&amp;interface=print&amp;showfn=yes&amp;showxref">Matt 6: 22, 23</a>; <a href="http://bible.gospelcom.net/cgi-bin/bible?passage=Luke%2011:-34&amp;version=ESV&amp;interface=print&amp;showfn=yes&amp;showxref">Luke 11:-34</a>. 
</blockquote>
<p>Here 'the eye' is the understanding, the spiritual constituent of which is faith, as also is shown by the explanation added here -'if therefore the light 
is darkness, how great is the darkness!' Similarly in the same gospel, </p>
<blockquote>
If your right eye causes you to stumble, pluck it out and throw it away from you. <a href="http://bible.gospelcom.net/cgi-bin/bible?passage=Matt%205:%2029;%2018:%209&amp;version=ESV&amp;interface=print&amp;showfn=yes&amp;showxref">Matt 5: 29; 18: 9</a>. 
</blockquote>
<p>'The left eye' is the 
understanding part of the mind, whereas 'the right eye' is its affection. The command to pluck out the right eye means that if it causes one to stumble one's affection must be disciplined. </p>
<p></p>
<p><b>[3]</b>
 In 
the same gospel, </p>
<blockquote>
Blessed are your eyes, for they see, and your ears, for they hear. <a href="http://bible.gospelcom.net/cgi-bin/bible?passage=Matt%2013:%2016&amp;version=ESV&amp;interface=print&amp;showfn=yes&amp;showxref">Matt 13: 16</a>. 
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
And in Luke, Jesus said to the disciples, Blessed are the eyes which see what you see. <a href="http://bible.gospelcom.net/cgi-bin/bible?passage=Luke%2010:-23&amp;version=ESV&amp;interface=print&amp;showfn=yes&amp;showxref">Luke 10:-23</a>. 
</blockquote>
<p>Here 'the eyes which see' means intelligence and faith, for it was not the mere fact that they saw the Lord and also His miracles and works that caused any one of the disciples to be blessed 
but the fact that they could grasp things with their understandings and had faith, meant by 'seeing with the eyes', and that they were obedient, meant by 'hearing with the ears'. As regards 'seeing with 
the eyes' meaning to see with the understanding and also to have faith, see <a href="897.htm">897</a>, <a href="2325.htm">2325</a>. For the understanding is the spiritual complement of sight, and faith the spiritual complement of the understanding. 
The sight of the eye is received from the light of the world, the sight of the understanding from the light of heaven flowing into things which belong to the light of the world; but the sight of 
faith is received from the light of heaven. This is the origin of such phrases as seeing with the understanding and seeing with faith. 'Hearing with the ear' means being obedient, see <a href="2542.htm">2542</a>. </p>
<p></p>
<p><b>[4]</b>
 In 
Mark, </p>
<blockquote>
Jesus said to the disciples, Do you not yet know nor understand? Do you still have your heart hardened? Having eyes do you not see, and having ears do you not hear? <a href="http://bible.gospelcom.net/cgi-bin/bible?passage=Mark%208:-17,%2018&amp;version=ESV&amp;interface=print&amp;showfn=yes&amp;showxref">Mark 8:-17, 18</a>. 
</blockquote>
<p>Here 
it is evident that 'having eyes but not seeing' means not wishing to understand and not believing. In Luke, </p>
<blockquote>
Jesus said of the city, Would that you knew the things that make for your peace! But such 
is hidden from your eyes. <a href="http://bible.gospelcom.net/cgi-bin/bible?passage=Luke%2019:-41,%2042&amp;version=ESV&amp;interface=print&amp;showfn=yes&amp;showxref">Luke 19:-41, 42</a>. 
</blockquote>
<p>And in Mark, </p>
<blockquote>
By the Lord has this been done, and it is marvellous in our eyes. <a href="http://bible.gospelcom.net/cgi-bin/bible?passage=Mark%2012:-11&amp;version=ESV&amp;interface=print&amp;showfn=yes&amp;showxref">Mark 12:-11</a>. 
</blockquote>
<p>Here 'hidden from the eyes' and 'marvellous in the eyes' 
mean to be so to the understanding, as is well known to everyone from the meaning of 'the eyes' even in everyday speech. </p>

`Aperuit Deus oculos ejus': quod significet intelligentiam, constat a significatione `aperire,' et quod Deus aperiret, tum ab `oculorum,' quod sint dare intelligentiam; quod `oculi' significent intellectum, 
videatur n. 212, similiter ac `visus seu videre,' n. 2150, 2325; dicitur quod `Deus aperiat oculos' cum interiorem visum seu intellectam, quod fit per influxum in rationale hominis, seu potius, 
in spirituale rationalis ejus, [et] hoc per viam animae seu internam, homini ignotam; hic influxus est status illustrationis ejus, in quo confirmatur ei vera quae audit vel quae legit, quadam perceptione 
interius in ejus intellectuali: hoc credit homo ei insitum esse, et a propria facultate intellectuali provenire, sed maximopere fallitur, est influxus per caelum a Domino in obscurum, fallax, et 
apparens hominis, et per bonum inibi facit illa quae credit, veri aemula; sed illustratione in spiritualibus fidei solum illi beantur qui spirituales sunt; est hoc quod significatur per quod `aperiat 
Deus oculos.'  [2] Quod `oculus' significet intellectum, est quia visus corporis correspondet visui spiritus ejus, qui est intellectus; et quia correspondet, per `oculum' in Verbo, fere ubicumque nominatur, 
significatur intellectus, etiam ubi aliter creditur; sicut ubi Dominus dicit apud Matthaeum, 	Lucerna corporis est oculus, si oculus simplex, totum corpus lucidum; si oculus malus, totum corpus 
obtenebratum; 	si ergo lumen sunt tenebrae, tenebrae quantae, vi 22, 23; Luc. xi 34; </p>
<p>ubi `oculus' est intellectus, cujus spirituale est fides, quod etiam constare potest ab explicatione ibi `si ergo 
lumen sunt tenebrae, tenebrae quantae': similiter apud eundem, 	Si oculus dexter scandalizaverit, erue eum, et abjice abs te, v 29; xviii 9; </p>
<p>[3] `oculus sinister' est intellectuale, `oculus autem 
dexter' est affectio ejus, quod `oculus dexter eruendus' est quod domanda affectio si scandalizat: apud eundem, 	Vestri beati sunt oculi quia vident, et aures vestrae quia audiunt, xiii 16: </p>
<p>et apud 
Lucam, 	Jesus dixit ad discipulos, Beati oculi qui vident quae videtis, x 23; </p>
<p>ibi per `oculos qui vident' significatur intelligentia et fides; nam quod viderint Dominum, tum Ipsius miracula et opera, 
non quemquam beatum reddidit, sed quod intellectu ceperint et fidem habuerint, quod est `videre oculis,' et quod oboediverint est quod est `auribus audire'; quod `videre oculis' sit intelligere, tum 
quoque fidem habere, videatur n. 897, 2325; intellectus enim {1} est spirituale visus, et fides est spirituale intellectus; visus oculi est a luce mundi, visus intellectus est a luce caeli influentis 
in illa quae sunt lucis mundi, visus autem fidei est a luce caeli; inde dicitur videre intellectu, et videre fide {2}; quod `aure audire' sit oboedire, videatur n. 2542: [4] apud Marcum, 	Jesus ad 
discipulos, Nondumne cognoscitis {3}, neque intelligitis? adhuc ne obduratum habetis cor vestrum? oculos habentes non videtis, et aures habentes non auditis? viii 17, 18; </p>
<p>ubi patet quod non (o)velle 
intelligere et non credere sit `oculos habere et non videre': apud Lucam, 	Jesus de urbe, Si nosses... quae ad pacem tuam, sed absconditum est ab oculis tuis, xix 41, 42: </p>
<p>et apud Marcum, 	A Domino 
hoc factum, et mirabile est in oculis nostris, xii 11; </p>
<p>ubi quod `absconditum ab oculis' et `mirabile in oculis' sit coram intellectu, cuivis ex significatione oculi, etiam in familiari sermone usu,
