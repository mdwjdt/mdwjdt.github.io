<h3 align="center" class="ired">属天的奥秘 第6388节</h3>
<h4 align="center"></h4><p><strong>6388.</strong>“以萨迦”表从行为或工作中所获得的回报。这从“以萨迦”的代表清楚可知，“以萨迦”是指作为“工价”或回报所赚取的相爱（<a href="3956.htm">3956</a>，<a href="3957.htm">3957</a>节），在此是指从行为或工作中所获得的回报，这一点从关于以萨迦的这段预言在内义上的每个细节明显看出来。此外，在原文，“以萨迦”表示“工价”或回报。“以萨迦”之所以在此表示从行为或工作中所获得的回报，而之前却表示相爱，是因为“以萨迦”在此表示那些处于某种表面相爱，也就是某种表面的对邻之仁的人。但他们想要因他们所做的善行而获得回报；因此，他们不仅玷污，还扭曲了真正的相爱，或仁爱；因为处于真正相爱的人在向邻舍行善时，便进入他们的快乐和赐福中；他们再没有更多渴求。这种快乐和赐福本身就是回报；在来世，它会变成天上的喜乐和幸福，从而变成他们的天堂本身。因为当天上那些处于这爱的人履行有用的服务或发挥功用，向他行善时，就会感受到如此充分的喜乐和幸福，以致他们觉得那时自己第一次身处天堂。这种感觉是主赐给他们的；祂照各人所履行的有用服务或所发挥的功用而将它赏赐给各人。<br />不过，他们一思想回报，哪怕思想他们早已获得的真正回报，也会使得这爱变得不洁，并败坏它。原因在于，那时他们想的是自己，而不是邻舍，也就是说，想的是如何使自己幸福，而不是如何使他人幸福，除非他们自己能从中受益。因此，他们将对邻之爱转变为对自己的爱；他们越是这样做，出于天堂的喜乐和幸福就越无法传给他们，因为他们将来自天堂的幸福流注集中到自己身上，而不是转给他人。他们就像不反射光线，而是吸收光线的物体。反射光线的物体会照亮、发光；而吸收光线的物体则不透明，根本不发光。因此，像这样的人会从天使社群那里被分离出去，和那些与天堂无份的人一样；他们就是此处被描述为“以萨迦”的人。</p>

Issachar. That this signifies reward from works, is evident from the representation of Issachar, as being the mutual love which is "hire," or reward (n. 3956, 3957), here reward from works, as is plain 
from the details in the internal sense in this prophecy about Issachar. Moreover in the original tongue "Issachar" means "hire." That "Issachar" here signifies reward from works, and previously mutual 
love, is because by "Issachar" are here meant those who are in a certain kind and appearance of mutual love, that is, of charity toward the neighbor, and who desire to be rewarded for the goods which 
they do. Thus they not only defile, but also pervert genuine mutual love, or charity; for they who are in genuine mutual love are in their delight and bliss when they are benefiting the neighbor, 
for they desire nothing more. This delight and bliss are what is meant by "hire" in the Word; for the delight and bliss is itself the reward; and in the other life this becomes the joy and happiness which 
are in heaven, thus it becomes heaven to them. For when they who are in this love perform uses, and do good to others, they are in such joy and happiness that then for the first time they seem to 
themselves to be in heaven; this is given them by the Lord, to everyone according to the uses he performs. But the happiness vanishes as soon as they think of reward, for being in the reward itself, 
thought about reward renders that love impure, and perverts it; the reason of which is that they are then thinking about themselves, and not about the neighbor, that is, about making themselves happy, 
and not others, except Insofar as it affects themselves. Thus they convert love toward the neighbor into love toward themselves, and so far as they do this, so far the joy and happiness from heaven cannot 
be communicated to them, for they concentrate upon themselves the influx of happiness from heaven, and do not transmit it to others; and they are like objects which do not transmit the rays of light, 
but absorb them. Objects which transmit the rays of light appear in light, and sparkle, but those which absorb them appear opaque, and sparkle not at all; and therefore they who are of this nature 
are separated from angelic society, like those who have nothing in common with heaven. These are they who are here described under the name of "Issachar." </p>

'Issachar' means recompense gained from works. This is clear from the representation of 'Issachar' as mutual love which is earned as a reward or recompense, dealt with in <a href="3956.htm">3956</a>, <a href="3957.htm">3957</a>. Here recompense 
gained from works is meant, as is evident in the internal sense from every detail mentioned in this prophetic utterance concerning Issachar, in addition to which Issachar in the original language means 
reward. The reason why 'Issachar' here means recompense gained from works, whereas previously he meant mutual love, is that here one has to understand by Issachar people with whom some kind and appearance 
of mutual love, that is, of charity towards the neighbour, is present. But they wish to receive recompense for the good deeds they do; thus genuine mutual love or charity is not merely tainted 
by them but actually perverted. For people with whom genuine mutual love resides enter into the delight and blessedness that is theirs when they. perform good deeds to their neighbour; there is nothing 
they desire more. That delight and blessedness is what is meant in the Word by 'reward', for delight or blessedness is the reward, and in the next life it becomes the joy and happiness that is experienced 
in heaven, and so becomes for those people heaven itself. For when those in heaven with whom that love resides perform useful services and good deeds for others, they feel so full of joy and happiness 
that they seem to themselves to be in heaven for the first time then. This feeling is granted them by the Lord; and He grants it to each one according to the nature of the service he performs. </p>

But that happiness departs the moment they think of recompense, for thought of recompense, even though they already have the true recompense, renders that love impure and corrupts it. The reason 
for this is that they are now thinking about themselves, not about their neighbour, that is, how they themselves can be made happy, not how others can be unless they themselves benefit from it. Thus 
they turn love towards the neighbour into love towards themselves; and to the extent that they do so they prevent joy and happiness from being communicated to them out of heaven, since they channel 
the flow of happiness from heaven into themselves and do not pass it on to others. They are like objects which do not reflect rays of light but absorb them. Objects that do reflect them are lit up and 
shining, whereas those that absorb them are dull and not at all shining. People who are like this are therefore separated from angelic society, like those who have nothing in common with heaven; and 
these are the ones who are described here by 'Issachar'. </p>

`Jisaschar': quod significet remunerationem ex operibus, constat ex repraesentatione `Jisascharis' quod sit amor mutuus qui merces seu remuneratio, de qua n. 3956, 3957; hic remuneratio ex operibus, 
ut patet a singulis in sensu interno, quae in hoc prophetico de Jisaschare dicuntur; Jisaschar etiam in lingua originali significat mercedem.  Quod `Jisaschar' significet hic remunerationem ex operibus, 
ac prius amorem mutuum, est quia per Jisascharem hic intelliguntur illi qui in quadam specie et apparentia amoris mutui, hoc est, charitatis erga proximum sunt, et propter bona quae {1}faciunt, remunerari 
volunt; ac ita amorem genuinum mutuum seu charitatem non modo inquinant sed etiam pervertunt; qui enim in genuino illo amore sunt, in suo jucundo et beato sunt cum benefaciunt proximo, nam nihil 
potius desiderant; id jucundum et id beatum est quod per `mercedem' in Verbo intelligitur, nam ipsum jucundum seu beatum est merces, {2}et id in altera vita fit gaudium et felicitas quae in caelo, 
ita fit illis caelum; nam qui ibi in amore illo sunt, cum usus praestant et bona aliis faciunt, in tali gaudio et felicitate sunt ut videantur sibi tunc primum esse in caelo; hoc {3}datur illis a Domino, 
cuique secundum usus; sed felicitas illa evanescit ut primum de remuneratione cogitant, nam cogitatio de remuneratione cum {4}tamen in ipsa remuneratione sunt, amorem illum impurum reddit et pervertit; 
causa est quia tunc de se cogitant et non de proximo, nempe ut {5}semet felices reddant non autem alios nisi quantum se; ita amorem erga proximum vertunt in amorem erga se, et quantum hoc faciunt 
tantum illis non communicari potest gaudium et felicitas ex caelo; concentrant enim influxum felicis e caelo in se nec illum transmittunt ad alios, suntque similes objectis quae radios lucis non remittunt 
sed absorbent, illa objecta apparent in luce, ac rutilant, haec autem in opaco sunt et prorsus non rutilant; {6}quapropter illi qui tales sunt, separantur e societate angelica {7}, sicut qui nihil 
commune cum caelo habent; {8}hi sunt qui hic describuntur per Jisascharem. @1 i ex amore illo$ @2 id quoque$ @3 dat illis Dominus$ @4 in ea ipsa$ @5 se$ @6 inde$ @7 i et delabuntur$ @8 qui 
itaque tales sunt$ </p>
