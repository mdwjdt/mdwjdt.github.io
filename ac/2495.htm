CHAPTER 20            That the Word contains within it an internal sense that is not apparent in the letter has already been stated and shown in many places, and the nature of this internal sense appears 
from all that has thus far been unfolded, beginning with the first chapter of Genesis. Nevertheless as the few who at this day believe in the Word do not know that there is such a sense, it may 
be well to confirm it further. [2] The Lord describes the Consummation of the Age, or the last period of the church, as follows: </p>
<p>     Immediately after the affliction of those days the sun shall be 
darkened, and the moon shall not give her light, and the stars shall fall from heaven, and the powers of the heavens shall be shaken (Matt. 24:29; Mark 13:24). That in this passage the "sun" does not 
mean the sun, nor the "moon" the moon, nor the "stars" the stars; but that the "sun" signifies love to the Lord and charity toward the neighbor; the "moon" the faith of love and charity; and the "stars" 
the knowledges of good and truth, was shown above (n. 31, 32, 1053, 1521, 1529-1531, 2120, 2441); so that by these words of the Lord there is signified that in the consummation of the age (or last 
period of the church) there will no longer be any love, or charity, nor therefore any faith. [3] That this is the meaning is evident from similar words of the Lord in the Prophets, as in Isaiah: </p>
<p> 
    Behold, the day of Jehovah cometh, to make the earth a solitude and He shall destroy the sinners thereof out of it; for the stars of the heavens and the constellations thereof shall not shine with 
their light; the sun shall be darkened in his going forth, and the moon shall not cause her light to shine (Isa. 13:9-10); </p>
<p>where also the last period of the church, or what is the same, the consummation 
of the age, is treated of. In Joel: </p>
<p>     A day of darkness and of thick darkness, a day of cloud and obscurity, before Him the earth quaked, the heavens trembled, the sun and the moon were darkened, 
and the stars withdrew their shining (Joel 2:2, 10); </p>
<p>with a similar meaning. Again in the same: </p>
<p>     The sun shall be turned into darkness, and the moon into blood, before the great and terrible 
day of Jehovah comes (Joel 2:31). And again in the same: </p>
<p>     The day of Jehovah is near, the sun and the moon have been darkened, and the stars have withdrawn their shining (Joel 3:14-15). In Ezekiel: </p>
<p> 
    When I shall extinguish thee, I will cover the heavens, and make the stars thereof dark; I will cover the sun with a cloud, and the moon shall not make her light to shine; all the luminaries 
of light in the heavens will I make dark, and will set darkness upon thy land (Ezek. 32:7-8). So too in John: </p>
<p>     I saw when he opened the sixth seal, and behold there was a great earthquake, and 
the sun became black as sackcloth of hair, and the moon became as blood, and the stars fell unto the earth (Rev. 6:12, 13).      The fourth angel sounded, so that the third part of the sun was smitten, 
and the third part of the moon, and the third part of the stars, and the third part of them was darkened (Rev. 8:12). [4] From these passages it is evident that the Lord's words in the Evangelists 
involve much the same as His words in the Prophets, namely, that in the last times there will be neither charity, nor faith; and that this is the internal sense; as also is still further evident in 
Isaiah: </p>
<p>     The moon shall blush, and the sun shall be ashamed, for Jehovah Zebaoth shall reign in Mount Zion, and in Jerusalem (Isa. 24:23); </p>
<p>that is to say, faith, which is the "moon," shall blush; 
and charity, which is the "sun," shall be ashamed, because they are such; for it cannot be said of the moon and the sun that they shall blush and be ashamed. And in Daniel: </p>
<p>     The goat's horn grew 
toward the south, and toward the east, and grew even to the army of the heavens, and some of the army and of the stars it cast down to the earth and trampled upon them (Dan. 8:9-10); </p>
<p>where it is 
plain to everyone that the "army of the heavens" does not signify an "army," nor the "stars" stars.            GENESIS 20 </p>
<p>     1. And Abraham journeyed thence toward the land of the south, and dwelt 
between Kadesh and Shur, and he sojourned in Gerar.      2. And Abraham said of Sarah his wife, She is my sister; and Abimelech king of Gerar sent and took Sarah.      3. And God came to Abimelech 
in a dream by night, and said to him, Behold thou wilt die because of the woman whom thou hast taken, for she is married to a husband.      4. And Abimelech had not come near her; and he said, Lord, 
wilt Thou slay also a righteous nation?      5. Said he not himself unto me, She is my sister? And she herself also said, He is my brother: in the uprightness of my heart and in the blamelessness 
of my hands have I done this.      6. And God said unto him in the dream, Yea, I know that in the uprightness of thy heart thou hast done this; and I also withheld thee from sinning against Me; therefore 
I did not suffer thee to touch her.      7. And now restore the man's wife, for he is a prophet; and he shall pray for thee, and thou shalt live; and if thou restore her not, know thou that dying 
thou shalt die, thou and all that are thine.      8. And Abimelech rose early in the morning, and called all his servants, and spoke all these words in their ears; and the men feared greatly.     
 9. And Abimelech called Abraham, and said unto him, What hast thou done unto us? And wherein have I sinned against thee that thou hast brought on me and on my kingdom a great sin? Thou hast done unto 
me deeds that ought not to be done.      10. And Abimelech said unto Abraham, What sawest thou that thou hast done this word?      11. And Abraham said, Because I said, Surely there is no fear of God 
in this place, and they will kill me on account of the word of my wife.      12. And moreover truly she is my sister, being the daughter of my father, but not the daughter of my mother, and she became 
my wife.      13. And it came to pass when God caused me to depart from my father's house that I said unto her, This is thy goodness which thou shalt do unto me; at every place whither we shall 
come, say of me, He is my brother.      14. And Abimelech took flock and herd, and menservants and maidservants, and gave unto Abraham; and restored to him Sarah his wife.      15. And Abimelech said, 
Behold my land is before thee; dwell in that which is good in thine eyes.      16. And unto Sarah he said, Behold I have given a thousand of silver to thy brother; behold it is unto thee a covering 
of the eyes to all that are with thee, and with all; and she was vindicated.      17. And Abraham prayed unto God, and God healed Abimelech, and his wife, and his maidservants; and they brought forth.  
    18. For closing Jehovah had therefore closed every womb of the house of Abimelech, because of the word of Sarah, Abraham's wife. </p>

It has been stated and shown in many places already that the Word has an internal sense within it that is not seen in the letter. Also the nature of that sense is evident from the explanation given so 
far from Genesis <a href="1.htm">1</a> onwards. Even so, because the few at the present day who do believe in the Word do not in spite of that belief know about the existence of such an internal sense, let further confirmation 
of it be given.  </p>
<p></p>
<p><b>[2]</b>
 The Lord describes the close of the age, that is, the final period of the Church, as follows, </p>
<blockquote>
Immediately after the affliction of those days the sun will be darkened, 
and the moon will not give its light, and the stars will fall from heaven, and the powers of the heavens will be shaken. <a href="http://bible.gospelcom.net/cgi-bin/bible?passage=Matt%2024:%2029&amp;version=ESV&amp;interface=print&amp;showfn=yes&amp;showxref">Matt 24: 29</a>; <a href="http://bible.gospelcom.net/cgi-bin/bible?passage=Mark%2013:-24,%2025&amp;version=ESV&amp;interface=print&amp;showfn=yes&amp;showxref">Mark 13:-24, 25</a>. 
</blockquote>
<p>That 'the sun' here does not mean the sun, 
nor 'the moon' the moon, nor 'the stars' the stars, but that 'the sun' means love to the Lord and charity towards the neighbour, 'the moon' faith received from love and charity, and 'the stars' cognitions 
of good and truth, has been shown in <a href="31.htm">31</a>, <a href="32.htm">32</a>, <a href="1053.htm">1053</a>,<a href="1521.htm">1521</a>, <a href="1529.htm">1529</a>-<a href="1531.htm">1531</a>, <a href="2120.htm">2120</a>, <a href="2441.htm">2441</a>. Thus these words spoken by the Lord mean that when the close of the age or final period has arrived there will no longer 
be any love or any charity, or consequently any faith. It is evident that this is their meaning from similar words of the Lord that occur in the Prophets, as in Isaiah, </p>
<blockquote>
Behold, the day of Jehovah 
comes, to make the earth a desolation, and He will destroy its sinners from it. For the stars of the heavens and their constellations will not shine with their light. The sun will be darkened in 
its rising, and the moon will not give its light. <a href="http://bible.gospelcom.net/cgi-bin/bible?passage=Isa%2013:%209,%2010&amp;version=ESV&amp;interface=print&amp;showfn=yes&amp;showxref">Isa 13: 9, 10</a>. 
</blockquote>
<p>This too refers to the final period of the Church, or what amounts to the same, the close of the age. </p>
<p></p>
<p><b>[3]</b>
 In Joel, </p>
<blockquote>
A day of darkness 
and thick darkness, a day of cloud and obscurity. The earth quaked before Him, the heavens trembled. The sun and the moon were darkened, and the stars withdrew their shining. <a href="http://bible.gospelcom.net/cgi-bin/bible?passage=Joel%202:-2,%2010&amp;version=ESV&amp;interface=print&amp;showfn=yes&amp;showxref">Joel 2:-2, 10</a>. 
</blockquote>
<p>Here 
the meaning is similar. Elsewhere in the same prophet, </p>
<blockquote>
The sun will be turned into darkness, and the moon into blood, before the great and terrible day of Jehovah comes. <a href="http://bible.gospelcom.net/cgi-bin/bible?passage=Joel%202:-31&amp;version=ESV&amp;interface=print&amp;showfn=yes&amp;showxref">Joel 2:-31</a>. 
</blockquote>
<p>In addition 
in the same prophet, </p>
<blockquote>
The day of Jehovah is near. The sun and the moon have been darkened, and the stars have withdrawn their shining. <a href="http://bible.gospelcom.net/cgi-bin/bible?passage=Joel%203:-14,%2015&amp;version=ESV&amp;interface=print&amp;showfn=yes&amp;showxref">Joel 3:-14, 15</a>. 
</blockquote>
<p>In Ezekiel, </p>
<blockquote>
When I have blotted you 
out, I will cover the heavens and darken their stars, I will cover the sun with a cloud, and the moon will not give its light. All the bright lights in the heavens I will make dark over you, and I will 
put darkness over your land. <a href="http://bible.gospelcom.net/cgi-bin/bible?passage=Ezek%2032:%207,%208&amp;version=ESV&amp;interface=print&amp;showfn=yes&amp;showxref">Ezek 32: 7, 8</a>. 
</blockquote>
<p>Likewise in John, </p>
<blockquote>
When he opened the sixth seal I looked, and behold, a great earthquake took place, and the sun became black as sackcloth made of 
hair, and the full moon became like blood, and the stars fell to the earth. <a href="http://bible.gospelcom.net/cgi-bin/bible?passage=Rev%206:%2012,%2013&amp;version=ESV&amp;interface=print&amp;showfn=yes&amp;showxref">Rev 6: 12, 13</a>. 
</blockquote>
<p>In the same book, </p>
<blockquote>
The fourth angel sounded, so that the third part of the sun was struck, and the third 
part of the moon, and the third part of the stars, and a third part of them was darkened. <a href="http://bible.gospelcom.net/cgi-bin/bible?passage=Rev%208:12&amp;version=ESV&amp;interface=print&amp;showfn=yes&amp;showxref">Rev 8:12</a>. 
</blockquote>
<p></p>
<p><b>[4]</b>
 These places show clearly that the Lord's words in the Gospels embody much the same as the 
Lord's words in the Prophets - namely that in the last times there will be no charity and no faith - and that this is the internal sense. All this is further evident in Isaiah, </p>
<blockquote>
The moon will blush, 
and the sun be ashamed, for Jehovah Zebaoth will reign on Mount Zion and in Jerusalem. <a href="http://bible.gospelcom.net/cgi-bin/bible?passage=Isa%2024:%2023&amp;version=ESV&amp;interface=print&amp;showfn=yes&amp;showxref">Isa 24: 23</a>. 
</blockquote>
<p>The meaning here is that faith, which is 'the moon', will blush, and charity, which is 'the sun', 
will be ashamed because their condition is such; for it cannot be said of the moon and the sun that they will blush and be ashamed. And in Daniel, </p>
<blockquote>
The horn of the he-goat grew towards the south, 
and towards the east, and grew even towards the host of heaven, and it cast down to the earth some of the host, and of the stars, and trampled on them. <a href="http://bible.gospelcom.net/cgi-bin/bible?passage=Dan%208:%209,%2010&amp;version=ESV&amp;interface=print&amp;showfn=yes&amp;showxref">Dan 8: 9, 10</a>. 
</blockquote>
<p>Here it is evident to anyone 
that 'the host of heaven' does not mean a host, nor 'the stars' the stars. </p>

{1}                  LIBRI GENESEOS 				    CAPUT VIGESIMUM QUOD in Verbo sensus internus sit, qui non apparet in littera, prius multis in locis dictum et ostensum est, et qualis es patet ex illis 
quae a primo capite Geneseos huc usque explicata sunt: verumtamen, quia pauci illi hodie qui credunt Verbo, usque non sciunt quod talis sensus sit, licet adhuc idem confirmare: [2] Dominus Consummationem 
saeculi, hoc est, ultimum tempus Ecclesiae, ita describit, 	Statim post afflictionem dierum istorum sol obscurabitur, et luna non dabit lumen suum, et stellae cadent de caelo, et virtutes caelorum 
commovebuntur, Matth. xxiv 29; Marc. xiii 24 [25]; </p>
<p>quod `sol' hic non significet solem, non `luna' lunam, nec `stellae' stellas, sed quod `sol' amorem in Dominum et charitatem erga proximum, `luna' 
amoris et charitatis fidem, et `stellae' cognitiones boni e veri, ostensum est, n. 31, 32, 1053, 1521, 1529-1531, 2120, 2441 ita per illa Domini verba significatur quod in consummatione saeculi, seu 
in ultimo tempore, nullus amplius amor et nulla charitas, proinde nulla fides, erit; quod ille sensus sit, patet a similibus Domini verbis apud Prophetas, ut apud Esaiam, 	Ecce dies Jehovae venit,... 
ad ponendum terram in solitudinem, et peccatores ejus perdet ex ea; nam stellae caelorum, et sidera eorum non lucebunt luce sua; obtenebrabitur sol in ortu suo, et luna non splendere faciet lucem, xiii 
2, 10; </p>
<p>ubi etiam de ultimo tempore Ecclesiae, seu quod idem, de consummatione saeculi, agitur: [3] apud Joelem, 	Dies tenebrarum et caliginis, dies nubis et obscuritatis,... coram Ipso commota est 
terra, contremuerunt caeli, sol et luna atrati sunt, et stellae collegerunt {2} splendorem suum, ii 2, 10, similiter: alibi apud eundem, 	Sol vertetur in tenebras, et luna in sanguinem, antequam venit 
dies Jehovae magnus et terribilis, iii 4: </p>
<p>(o)adhuc apud eundem, 	Propinquus dies Jehovae,... sol et luna atrati sunt; et stellae retraxerunt {2} splendorem {3}, iv 14, 15: </p>
<p>apud Ezechielem, 	Obtegam, 
cum exstinxero te, caelos, et atrabo stellas eorum, solem nube obtegam, et luna non lucere faciet lumen suum, omnia luminaria lucis in caelis atrabo (t)super te, et dabo tenebras super terra tua, 
xxxii 7, 8: </p>
<p>pariter apud Johannem, 	Vidi, cum aperuit sigillum sextum, cum ecce terrae motus magnus factus, et sol factus niger sicut saccus pilosus, et luna tota facta [est] sicut sanguis, et stellae 
ceciderunt in terram, Apoc. vi 12, 13; </p>
<p>apud eundem, 	Quartus angelus clanxit, ita ut percussa sit tertia pars solis, et tertia pars lunae, et tertia pars stellarum, et obtenebraretur tertia pars 
eorum, Apoc. viii 12; </p>
<p>[4] ex his locis constare potest quod Domini verba apud Evangelistas simile involvant ac Domini verba apud Prophetas, quod nempe ultimis temporibus nulla charitas, sed fides 
erit; et quod ille sit sensus internus; ut quoque patet adhuc apud Esaiam, 	Erubescet luna, et pudefiet sol, quia regnabit Jehovah Zebaoth in monte Zionis, et in Hierosolyma, xxiv 23; </p>
<p>hoc est, quod 
`erubescet' fides, quae est `luna,' et `pudefiet' charitas, quae est `sol,' quia talis; de luna et sole non dici potest quod erubescent et pudefient: et apud Danielem, 	Hircus cornu crevit versus meridiem, 
et versus ortum,... et crevit usque ad exercitum caelorum, et dejecit in terram de exercitu, et de stellis, et conculcavit eas, viii 9, 10, ubi quod `exercitus caelorum' non significet exercitum, 
nec `stellae' stellas, cuivis patet. 	@1 In A there are two drafts of n. 2495-2516. The differences between them are not great. Important ones will be noted in the following pages otherwise notes 
refer to second draft.$ 	@2 In Heb. collegerunt (Joel ii)and retraxerunt (Joel iv) are the same word, which Sch renders by contraxerunt; S alters to collegerunt in both cases, but in the latter, alters 
again to retraxerunt.$ 	@3 i suum.$ </p>
<p>					CAPUT XX 	1.  ET profectus est inde Abraham versus terram meridiei, et habitavit inter Kadesh et inter Shur, et peregrinatus est in Gerar. 	2.  Et dixit 
Abraham ad Sarah uxorem suam, Soror mea haec; et misit Abimelech rex Geraris, et accepit Saram. 	3.  Et venit DEUS ad Abimelech in somnio noctu, et dixit ei Ecce tu morieris propter mulierem, quam 
accepisti, et illa maritata marito. 	4.  Et Abimelech non appropinquaverat ad illam, et dixit, DOMINE, num gentem etiam justam occides? 	5.  Nonne ille dixit mihi, Soror mea haec? et ipsa etiam illa 
dixit, Frater meus ille. In rectitudine cordis mei, et in immunitate manuum mearum, feci hoc. 	6.  Et dixit ad eum DEUS in somnio, Etiam Ego novi, quod in rectitudine cordis tui feceris hoc, et prohibui 
etiam Ego te a peccando Mihi, propterea non dedi tibi ad attingendum ad illam. 	7.  Et nunc reduc uxorem viri, quia propheta ille, et orabit pro te, et vives; et si non tu reducas, scito, quod 
moriendo moriaris tu, et omnis qui tibi. 	8.  Et mane surrexit Abimelech in matutino, et vocavit omne servos suos, et locutus est omnia verba illa in auribus eorum, et timuerunt viri valde. 	9.  Et 
vocavit Abimelech Abrahamum, et dixit illi, Quid fecisti nobis, et quid peccavi tibi, quod adduxisti super me, et super regnum meum, peccatum grande? Facta, quae non fient, fecisti mecum. 	10.  Et 
dixit Abimelech ad Abrahamum, Quid vidisti quo feceris verbum hoc? 	11.  Et dixit Abraham, Quia dixi, verumtamen nullus timor DEI in loco hoc, et occident me propter verbum uxoris meae. 	12.  Et etiam 
vere soror mea, filia patris mei illa, verumtamen non filia matris meae; et facta mihi in uxorem. 	13.  Et factum, quando fecerunt discedere me Deus e domo patris mei, et dixi illi, Haec bonitas tua, 
quam facias mecum, a omnem locum quo venerimus, dic mihi, Frater meus ille. 	14.  Et accepit Abimelech gregem et armentum, et servos et ancillas, et dedit Abrahamo; et restituit illi Sarah uxorem 
ejus. 	15.  Et dixit Abimelech, Ecce terra mea coram te, in bono in oculis tuis habita. 	16.  Et Sarae dixit, Ecce dedi mille argenti fratri tuo, ecce illud tibi velamen oculorum omnibus qui tecum, 
et cum omnibus, et vindicata. 	17.  Et oravit Abraham ad DEUM, et sanavit DEUS Abimelechum, et uxorem ejus, et ancillas ejus, et pepererunt. 	18.  Quia claudendo clausit JEHOVAH propterea omnem uterum 
domus Abimelechi, propter verbum Sarae, uxoris Abrahami. </p>
