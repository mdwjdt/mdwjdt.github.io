<h3 align="center" class="ired">属天的奥秘 第2704节</h3>
<h4 align="center"></h4><p><strong>2704.</strong>“就给孩子水喝”表在属灵之物方面所给予的教导。这从“给水喝”和“孩子”的含义清楚可知：“给水喝”是指在真理方面给予教导；“孩子”是指真理方面的属灵之物（参看<a href="2697.htm">2697</a>节）。这种状态，也就是本节所论述的教导的状态，就是那些正从消磨或荒凉出来之人的第三个状态。因为当他们进入启示的状态，也就是天堂之光的状态时（如<a href="18.htm">18</a>节所述，参看<a href="2699.htm">2699</a>节），他们就会处于认识和学习真理的情感中；当处于这种情感中时，他们很容易，可以说自发充满真理。在世上，人们通过主的圣言或教义接受这些真理；而在天上的那些人则通过天使接受它们，天使觉得再没有比教导新来的弟兄，用构成天堂秩序的各种真理与良善充满它们，从而引向主更幸福、快乐的事了。</p>

And gave the child drink. That this signifies instruction in spiritual things, is evident from the signification of "giving to drink," as being to instruct in truths; and from the signification of the 
"child," as being the spiritual as to truth (see n. 2697). This state, which is that of instruction, treated of in this verse, is the third state of those who are coming out of vastation or desolation; 
for when they come into a state of enlightenment or of heavenly light (treated of in the preceding verse 18, see n. 2699), they are then in the affection of knowing and learning truths; and when they 
are in this affection, they are easily and as it were spontaneously imbued with truths: those who are on earth, from the Lord's Word or from doctrine; but those who are in heaven, from the angels, 
who perceive nothing more blessed and happy than to teach novitiate brethren, and imbue them with the truths and goods which are of heavenly order, and thus lead to the Lord. </p>

<p align="center"><b>Elliott(1983-1999) 2704</b></p><p><b>2704.</b>
'And gave the boy a drink' means teaching given in things that are spiritual. This is clear from the meaning of 'giving a drink' as giving teaching in truths, and from the meaning of 'the boy' as the 
spiritual as regards truth, dealt with in <a href="2697.htm">2697</a>. This state, which is a state when teaching is given, dealt with in this verse, is the third state of people who come out of vastation or desolation. For 
when they enter a state of enlightenment, that is, of heavenly light, dealt with in verse 18, see <a href="2699.htm">2699</a>, they are governed by the affection for knowing and learning truths, and when they are governed 
by that affection truths are imparted to them easily and so to speak spontaneously. People on earth receive those truths from the Word of the Lord or from doctrine, but those in heaven receive them from 
the angels who never feel more blessed and happy than when they are teaching brethren newly arrived among them and imparting to them the goods and truths which constitute heavenly order and so lead 
on to the Lord. </p>

</p><b>2704.</b>
`Et potavit puerum': quod significet instructionem in spiritualibus, constat (c)a significatione `potare' quod sit instruere in veris; et ex significatione `pueri' quod sit spirituale quoad verum, de 
qua n. 2697.  Hic status, qui est instructionis, de quo in hoc versu, est tertius status eorum qui e vastatione seu desolatione veniunt; dum enim in statum illustrationis seu lucis caelestis veniunt, 
de quo in versu praec. 18, videatur n. 2699, tunc in affectione sciendi et discendi vera sunt, et cum in illa affectione, imbuuntur facile et quasi sponte veris, qui in terra, a Verbo Domini aut {1} 
a doctrina, qui autem in caelo, ab angelis, qui nihil beatius et felicius percipiunt quam novitios fratres docere et imbuere veris et bonis quae sunt ordinis caelestis, Ita quae ducunt ad Dominum. 	@1 seu.$ </p>
