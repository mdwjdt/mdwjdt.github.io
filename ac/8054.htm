<h3 align="center" class="ired">属天的奥秘 第8054节</h3>
<h4 align="center"></h4><p><strong>8054.</strong>“将来耶和华领你进迦南人、赫人、亚摩利人、希未人、耶布斯人之地”表进入那些陷入邪恶和虚假之人所占据的天堂区域。这从“迦南人、赫人、亚摩利人、希未人、耶布斯人之地”的含义清楚可知，“迦南人、赫人、亚摩利人、希未人、耶布斯人之地”是指天堂，在此是指被那些沉浸于邪恶和虚假之人占据的天堂区域。“迦南地”是指主在天上的国和祂在地上的国或教会（参看<a href="1413.htm">1413</a>，<a href="1437.htm">1437</a>，<a href="1585.htm">1585</a>，<a href="1607.htm">1607</a>，<a href="1866.htm">1866</a>，<a href="3038.htm">3038</a>，<a href="3481.htm">3481</a>，<a href="3686.htm">3686</a>，<a href="3705.htm">3705</a>，<a href="4116.htm">4116</a>，<a href="4240.htm">4240</a>，<a href="4447.htm">4447</a>，<a href="4454.htm">4454</a>，<a href="4516.htm">4516</a>，<a href="4517.htm">4517</a>，<a href="5136.htm">5136</a>，<a href="5757.htm">5757</a>，<a href="6516.htm">6516</a>节）。此处所提到这些民族表示邪恶和虚假，“迦南人”表示由源于邪恶的虚假所生的邪恶（<a href="4818.htm">4818</a>节）；“赫人”表示邪恶所来自的虚假（<a href="2913.htm">2913</a>节）；“亚摩利人”表示邪恶和由此衍生的虚假（<a href="1857.htm">1857</a>，<a href="6306.htm">6306</a>节）；“希未人”表示含有某种良善在里面的偶像崇拜（<a href="6860.htm">6860</a>节）；“耶布斯人”表示含有某种真理在里面的偶像崇拜（<a href="6860.htm">6860</a>节）。在主降临之前，那些属于属灵教会的人将要进入的天堂区域被邪恶和虚假占据（参看<a href="6858.htm">6858</a>节）。<br />为进一步探讨这个问题，要知道，在主降临之前，天堂并没有像在主降临之后那样被划分为三层天堂，即被划分为至内层或第三层天堂，中间或第二层天堂和最低或第一层天堂，而是一个天堂。属灵天堂尚未形成。属灵天堂所要存在的那片区域被那些陷入虚假和邪恶的人占据；然而，他们能通过外在手段，尤其通过显赫和地位被保守在某种真理和良善中，正如在世上的情形。在那里，那些陷入邪恶和虚假的人通过外在手段，也就是地位和利益被迫看似思想和谈论真理，意愿并实行良善。那时，这片天堂区域之所以被这类灵人占据，是因为缺少善人，那些属于属灵教会的人尚未做好准备；但是，天堂的每一个地方都必须被灵人充满，以提供从主这一端直到人类那一端的一个连续链条。因为这个连续链条若是中断，人类必要灭亡。现在还有一些天堂区域被这类灵人占据；但在那里的灵人被一种强大的力量阻止行恶。那些利用纯真欺骗并迷惑人的灵人就在那里的头顶正上方；不过，属于上古教会的属天人在这些灵人之上，这些属天人如此强有力地约束他们，以致他们绝无可能伤害任何人。如今，后脑勺也有一片曾为天堂的一部分，但现在被恶灵占据的区域；头部前面靠左一侧还有一片区域。<br />恶灵不断努力侵占善灵所在的地方；并且一旦这些地方没有被善灵充满，他们就会实际侵占它们。我常常意识到他们的努力。当世上恶人的数量增加，善人的数量减少时，这些区域就被如此占据；因为在这种情况下，恶灵会接近人类，而善灵则远离人类。善灵越远离，最接近人类的区域就越被恶灵占据。当这种情况普遍出现时，这些区域的居民就会完全被改变。当教会走到尽头时，这种改变就会发生，因为此时掌权的是邪恶和虚假。但在教会的末了，恶灵被扔了下去，他们所占据的区域被交给善灵；在此期间，这些善灵已经为天堂做好了准备。这就是启示录中这些话的含义：<br />在天上就有了争战。米迦勒同他的使者与龙争战。龙也同它的使者去争战。他们并没有得胜，天上再没有他们的地方。（启示录<a href="http://39-27.cn/启12.7.htm">12:7</a>，<a href="http://39-27.cn/启12.8.htm">8</a>）<br />迦南地和以色列人就代表天上的这种状态，因为各个民族占据迦南地；以色列人则将这些民族从迦南地赶出去。事实上，“迦南地”表示主的国度，因而表示天堂和教会，这从上面所引用的经文可以看出来。</p>

And it shall be when Jehovah shall have brought thee unto the land of the Canaanite, and the Hittite, and the Amorite, and the Hivite, and the Jebusite. That this signifies the region of heaven occupied 
by those who are in evil and falsity, is evident from the signification of "the land of the Canaanite, and the Hittite, and the Amorite, and the Hivite, and the Jebusite," as being heaven, here the 
region of heaven occupied by those who are in evil and falsity. (That "the land of Canaan" denotes the Lord's kingdom in heaven and earth, or the church, see n. 1413, 1437, 1585, 1607, 1866, 3038, 3481, 
3686, 3705, 4116, 4240, 4447, 4454, 4516, 4517, 5136, 5757, 6516.) Evils and falsities are signified by the nations here named-evil from the falsity of evil by "the Canaanite" (n. 4818); falsity 
from which is evil by "the Hittite" (n. 2913); evil and the derivative falsity by "the Amorite" (n. 1857, 6306); idolatry in which is something of good by "the Hivite" (n. 6860); and idolatry in which 
there is something of truth by "the Jebusite" (n. 6860). (That before the coming of the Lord the region of heaven into which they who were of the spiritual church would come, was occupied by evils and 
falsities, see n. 6858.)  [2] As to what further concerns this subject, be it known that before the Lord's coming heaven was not distinguished into three heavens, namely into the inmost or third, the 
middle or second, and the ultimate or first, as it was after the Lord's coming; but was one. The spiritual heaven was not yet formed. The region where the spiritual heaven was to be, was occupied by 
those who were in falsity and evil, but who could be kept in some truth and good by external means, especially by means of ideas of eminence and dignity, just as is the case in the world, where they 
who are in evil and falsity are nevertheless obliged to as it were think and speak truths, and as it were will and do goods, by external means, which are honors and gains. The reason why this region 
of heaven was then occupied by such spirits, was that good ones were lacking, and they who were of the spiritual church had not as yet been prepared, and yet every place had to be filled by spirits, in 
order that there might be continuity from the Lord down to man, for without continuity man would have perished. At this day also there are some regions of heaven occupied by such; but they who are there 
are withheld by a strong force from the doing of evils. Immediately above the head are they who deceive and seduce by means of innocence; but above them are the celestial from the Most Ancient Church, 
who keep them in bonds with such force that they cannot possibly occasion what is evil to anyone. Behind the back part of the head there is also at this day a region which had been a region of heaven, 
that is occupied by the evil; and another in front toward the left.  [3] There is also a continual endeavor on the part of the evil to invade the places where the good are, and they actually do 
invade them as soon as they are not filled by the good, which endeavor it has often been granted me to notice. These regions are thus occupied when the evil are increased and the good diminished in 
the world; for in this case evil spirits come near to man, and good spirits recede from him; and insofar as these recede, so far the regions nearest to man are occupied by the evil. When this condition 
becomes general, the inhabitants of these regions are completely changed. Much is the case when the church is near its end, for then evil and falsity prevail. But about the end of the church the evil 
are cast down, and the regions they had occupied are given to the good, who in the meantime have been prepared for heaven. This is meant by these words in John: </p>
<p>     There was war in heaven; Michael 
and his angels fought against the dragon; and the dragon fought and his angels; but they prevailed not, neither was their place found any more in heaven (Rev. 12:7, 8). This state of heaven was represented 
by the land of Canaan, in that the nations occupied it; and by the sons of Israel, in that they cast those nations out from it; for by the "land of Canaan" is signified the Lord's kingdom, thus 
heaven and the church, as can be seen from the passages cited above. </p>

'And it shall be when Jehovah brings you into the land of the Canaanite, and the Hittite, and the Amorite, and the Hivite, and the Jebusite' means into the region of heaven occupied by those steeped 
in evil and falsity. This is clear from the meaning of 'the land of the Canaanite, and the Hittite, and the Amorite, and the Hivite, and the Jebusite' as heaven, at this point the region of heaven occupied 
by those steeped in evil and falsity. 'The land of Canaan' is the Lord's kingdom in heaven, and His kingdom on earth, which is the Church, see <a href="1413.htm">1413</a>, <a href="1437.htm">1437</a>, <a href="1585.htm">1585</a>, <a href="1607.htm">1607</a>, <a href="1866.htm">1866</a>, <a href="3038.htm">3038</a>, <a href="3481.htm">3481</a>, <a href="3686.htm">3686</a>, <a href="3705.htm">3705</a>, <a href="4116.htm">4116</a>, <a href="4240.htm">4240</a>, <a href="4447.htm">4447</a>, <a href="4454.htm">4454</a>, <a href="4516.htm">4516</a>, <a href="4517.htm">4517</a>, <a href="5136.htm">5136</a>, <a href="5757.htm">5757</a>, <a href="6516.htm">6516</a>. Evils and falsities are meant by the nations mentioned here, evil begotten by falsity that springs from evil being meant by 'the Canaanite,, <a href="4818.htm">4818</a>; 
falsity from which evil arises by 'the Hittite', <a href="2913.htm">2913</a>; evil and consequent falsity by 'the Amorite', <a href="1857.htm">1857</a>, <a href="6306.htm">6306</a>; that which is idolatrous but has some kind of goodness in it by 'the Hivite', <a href="6860.htm">6860</a>; 
and that which is idolatrous but has some kind of truth in it by 'the Jebusite', <a href="6860.htm">6860</a>. The region of heaven into which those belonging to the spiritual Church were to come was occupied by evils and falsities 
before the Lord's Coming, see above in <a href="6858.htm">6858</a>. </p>
<p></p>
<p><b>[2]</b>
 To pursue this matter further, it should be recognized that before the Lord's Coming heaven was not divided into three separate heavens - the 
inmost or third, the middle or second, and the lowest or first - as it was after the Lord's Coming, but was a single heaven. The spiritual heaven did not yet exist. The region where the spiritual heaven 
was going to exist was occupied by those who were ruled by falsity and evil, yet could be kept in a state in which they felt encouraged by external means to adhere to some truth and good, especially 
by ideas of holding important positions and rank. It was just like what happens in the world. Here those ruled by evil, and by falsity, are nevertheless obliged by external means - by rank and position 
and by monetary gain - to look as if they are thinking and speaking things that are true, and willing and doing those that are good. The reason why that region of heaven was at that time occupied 
by such spirits was that there was a lack of good people, and those who belonged to the spiritual Church had not yet been made ready; yet every part of heaven needed to be filled with spirits to provide 
a continuous chain from the Lord at one end to mankind at the other. For had the chain been broken mankind would have perished. At the present day too there are some regions of heaven which are 
occupied by such spirits; but those who are in them are withheld by great force from doing evil. Directly overhead there are spirits who use innocence to deceive others and lead them astray; but above 
those spirits there are celestial ones belonging to the Most Ancient Church, who restrain them so forcibly that they cannot possibly inflict harm on anyone. At the back of the head there is also at the 
present day a region which was once part of heaven but is now occupied by evil spirits, as well as another region in front, over on the left. </p>
<p></p>
<p><b>[3]</b>
 The evil also constantly endeavour to take over 
the places where the good are, and do in actual fact take them over as soon as they cease to be filled with the good. I have often been made aware of their endeavour. Those regions are occupied when the 
number of wicked people in the world increases and that of the good diminishes; for then evil spirits come nearer mankind and good spirits move away. And the more the good spirits move away, the more 
the regions nearest mankind come to be occupied by evil spirits. When this becomes the situation generally, the inhabitants of those regions are changed completely. The change takes place when the 
Church is near its end since evil and falsity reign then. But around the end of the Church those who have taken over are expelled, and the regions once occupied by them are given to the good, who have 
in the meantime been made ready for heaven. This is the meaning of the following words in John, </p>
<blockquote>
War took place in heaven. Michael and his angels fought against the dragon, and the dragon fought, and 
his angels, but they did not prevail, nor was their place found any longer in heaven. <a href="http://bible.gospelcom.net/cgi-bin/bible?passage=Rev%2012:7,%208&amp;version=ESV&amp;interface=print&amp;showfn=yes&amp;showxref">Rev 12:7, 8</a>. 
</blockquote>
<p>This state of heaven was represented by the land of Canaan, in that the nations occupied it, and 
by the children of Israel, in that they expelled the nations from there. For the land of Canaan means the Lord's kingdom, thus heaven and the Church, as may be seen from the places enumerated  above </p>

falsis, videatur supra n. 6858. 	2 Quod hanc rem ulterius attinet, sciendum quod ante Adventum Domini caelum non distinctum fuerit in tres caelos, nempe in intimum seu tertium, in medium seu secundum, 
ac in ultimum seu primum, sicut post Adventum Domini, sed erat unum; {3}caelum spirituale nondum erat; regio ubi caelum spirituale futurum, occupata fuit ab illis qui in falso et malo, sed qui potuerunt 
teneri in aliquo vero et bono per media externa, imprimis per ideas eminentiae ac dignitatis, pariter ac fit in mundo; ibi qui in malo sunt et in falso, usque {4}obligantur, ut vera quasi cogitent 
et loquantur, utque bona quasi velint et faciant per media externa quae sunt {5}honores et lucra; causa quod regio illa caeli a talibus tunc occupata fuerit, erat {6}quia deerant boni, et qui ab Ecclesia 
spirituali nondum erant praeparati, et tamen ubivis a spiritibus impletum esse debuit ut esset continuum a Domino usque ad hominem, nam si discontinuum, periisset homo; sunt etiam hodie regiones 
{7}caeli aliquae a talibus occupatae, {8}at illi qui ibi vi forti (x)detinentur a malis faciendis; immediate supra caput sunt qui per innocentiam fallunt et seducunt, sed supra illos sunt caelestes 
ab Antiquissima Ecclesia, qui illos tenent in vinculis tali vi ut nequaquam possint (x)alicui malum inferre; post occipitium est quoque hodie regio {9}quae fuerat caeli occupata a malis; et quoque antrorsum 
versus sinistrum; malorum etiam conatus continuus est 3 invadendi {10}loca ubi boni, et actualiter invadunt, ut primum a bonis non impleta sunt; conatum illum saepius appercipere datum est; regiones 
illae occupantur cum in mundo augentur mali ac (x)diminuuntur boni, nam tunc ad hominem accedunt spiritus mali, et ab illo recedunt {11}spiritus boni, et quantum hi recedunt, tantum regiones proximae 
ad hominem occupantur a malis; cum hoc fit in communi, {12}incolae regionum illarum permutantur; hoc fit cum Ecclesia prope suum finem est, nam tunc regnat malum et falsum; sed circa finem Ecclesiae 
dejiciuntur illi, (c)et regiones occupatae dantur bonis qui interea ad caelum praeparati sunt; hoc intelligitur per haec apud Johannem, Factum est bellum in caelo; Michael et angeli ejus pugnarunt 
contra draconem, et draco pugnavit ac angeli ejus, sed non praevaluerunt, neque locus inventus est illorum amplius in caelo, [Apoc.] xii 7, 8. Hic status caeli repraesentatus est {13}per terram Canaanem,
