<h3 align="center" class="ired">属天的奥秘 第294节</h3>
<h4 align="center"></h4><p><strong>294.</strong>对于“皮衣”表属灵和属世之善，这只有揭开内义，对比经中类似的词句，才能明了。本节只是说“皮”，但山羊羔皮、绵羊皮、公羊皮之义是显而易见的。因为在圣经中，这些动物表良善、仁爱之情，用于献祭的绵羊，所表类似。具有仁爱之善，亦即属灵和属世之善者，被称为“绵羊”，主也因此被称为“牧羊人”，仁爱之人则被称为他的“羊”，这是众所周知的。</p>

<p><strong>[NCE]294.</strong> The symbolism of the leather tunic as spiritual and earthly goodness likewise escapes people unless it is revealed to them by an unveiling of the inner meaning and then by other places in the Word that use similar terms.<br />The verse uses the general word leather, which implies goat, sheep, and ram skins. In the Word, these symbolize good emotions, charity, and the effects of charity. The sheep used in sacrifices had a similar meaning.<br />Anyone with a supply of charitable goodness — that is, of spiritual and earthly goodness — is called a sheep. So the Lord is called the shepherd, and people who possess charity are termed sheep, as everyone knows. </p>
<p align="center"><b>Potts(1905-1910) 294</b></p><p><b>294.</b>
Neither would it be evident to anyone that a "coat of skin" signifies spiritual and natural good, except by a revelation of the internal sense, and a subsequent comparison of passages in the Word where 
similar expressions occur. The general term "skin" is here used, but that of a kid, sheep, or ram, is understood, which animals in the Word signify affections of good, charity, and that which is of 
charity, as was likewise signified by the sheep used in the sacrifices. Those are called "sheep" who are endowed with the good of charity, that is, with spiritual and natural good, and hence the Lord 
is called the "Shepherd of the sheep" and those who are endowed with charity are called His "sheep" as everybody knows. </p>

<p align="center"><b>Elliott(1983-1999) 294</b></p><p><b>294.</b>
That 'a coat of skin' means spiritual and natural good does not become clear to anybody except from the inner sense once it has been revealed, and also after that from similar usages where they occur 
in the Word. In this verse skin in general is referred to, and is used to mean the skin of kid, sheep, or ram. In the Word these mean affections for good; they also mean charity and things belonging 
to charity. The same was meant by the sheep used in sacrifices. People are called 'sheep' who are endowed with the good that stems from charity, that is, with spiritual and natural good. And this is why 
the Lord is called the Shepherd of the sheep, and why people who are endowed with charity are termed 'sheep', as is well known to everyone.  </p>

<p align="center"><b>Latin(1748-1756) 294</b>
</p><b>294.</b>
Quod 'tunica pellis' significet bonum spirituale et naturale, nec alicui constare potest nisi ex revelato sensu interiore; tum dein ex Verbo ubi similia occurrunt: hic in genere dicitur 'pellis,' et 
intelligitur pellis haedi, ovis, arietis, quae in Verbo significant affectiones boni, charitatem, et quae sunt charitatis; similia per 'oves' in sacrificiis: 'oves' appellantur quicumque sunt praediti 
bono charitatis, hoc est, bono spirituali et naturali; inde Dominus dicitur Pastor ovium, et qui charitate praediti sunt, vocantur 'oves,' ut cuivis notum est. </p>
