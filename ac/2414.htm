Verse 17. And it came to pass when they were leading them forth abroad, that he said, Escape for thy life; look not back behind thee, and stay not in all the plain; escape to the mountain, lest thou 
be consumed. "And it came to pass when they were leading them forth abroad," signifies the state when they were being withheld from falsity and evil; "that he said, Escape for thy life" signifies that 
he should take thought for his eternal life; "look not back behind thee," signifies that he should not look to doctrinal things; "and stay not in all the plain," signifies that he should not linger in 
any of these doctrinal matters; "escape to the mountain," signifies to the good of love and of charity; "lest thou be consumed," signifies that if he should do otherwise he would perish. </p>

<p>'And so it was, when they were leading them away outside' means a state when they were to be withheld from falsity and evil. 'That lone of the two] said, Escape for your 
life' means that he was to be concerned about his life to eternity. 'Do not look back behind you' means that he was not to look to matters of doctrine. 'And do not halt in all the plain' means that 
he was not to linger over any one of these. 'Escape into the mountain' means towards the good that flows from love and charity. 'Lest you are consumed' means, if he did anything else he would perish.

Vers. 17.  Et fuit, cum educerent ii illos foras, et dixit, Eripe te super anima tua, ne respicias post te, et ne consistas in omni planitie; in montem eripe te, ne forte consumaris. `Et fuit, cum educerent 
ii illos foras' significat statum cum detinerentur a falso et malo: `et dixit, Eripe te super anima tua' significat quod consuleret vitae suae in aeternum: `ne respicias post te' significat ne 
spectaret ad doctrinalia: `et ne consistas in omni planitie' significat quod in nullo eorum moraretur: `in montem eripe te' significat ad bonum amoris et charitatis: `ne forte consumaris' significat 
si aliter, periret. </p>
