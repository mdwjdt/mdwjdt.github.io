<h3 align="center" class="ired">属天的奥秘 第5343节</h3>
<h4 align="center"></h4><p><strong>5343.</strong>“城田地的粮食”表属于并适合这些内层的事物，即在内层与良善联结的真理。这从“粮食”的含义清楚可知，“粮食”是指与良善联结的真理（参看<a href="5340.htm">5340</a>，<a href="5342.htm">5342</a>节）。“城田地的粮食”之所以表示属于并适合这些内层的真理，是因为田属于城，并形成包围城的区域。就内义而言，形成包围区的部分表示属于并适合之物。这也是为何经上接下来说“就是城周围的，都存放在城中间”。形成包围区的部分之所以表示属于并适合之物，是因为与良善联结的一切真理都被排列成系列；这些系列具有这样的性质：与良善联结的真理处于每个系列的中间或至内在部分；属于并适合这中间或至内在部分的真理则在这些真理周围，依次类推，直至该系列消失所在的最外在部分。<br />这些系列本身也以类似方式相互关联，但照着状态的变化而各不相同。与良善联结的真理就具有这种排列，这一事实在来世经常以可见的方式呈现出来；因为在含有聪明和智慧在里面的天堂之光中，可见形像能用来表现这类事物。这事在尘世之光中是办不到的；如果人的内层没有被打开，这事在天堂之光也是办不到的；然而，他仍有能力通过理性视觉认识它们，并凭天堂之光通过运用推理看见它们。对真理的这些有序排列源于天上天使社群的排列；因为天使社群以哪种方式排列，与良善联结的真理就以哪种方式在重生之人里面排列；因为真理的这些系列对应于这些天使社群。</p>

The food of the field of the city. That this signifies things that belong and are suitable to them, namely, truths adjoined to good in the interiors, is evident from the signification of "food," as being 
truths adjoined to good (see n. 5340, 5342). The truths that belong and are suitable to the interiors are signified by the "food of the field of the city" because the field belonged to the city, 
and made its surrounding compass. Things that do this signify in the internal sense things suitable and belonging thereto; wherefore also it is immediately said, "that which was round about it, put he 
in the midst thereof." The reason why those things which make the surrounding compass signify things that belong and are suitable to, is that all truths joined to good are arranged in series; and the 
series are such that in the midst or inmost of each series there is truth joined to good, and round about this midst or inmost are the truths belonging and suitable thereto, and so on in order to the 
very outermost, where the series vanishes. The series themselves are also similarly arranged in relation to one another, but are varied according to changes of state.  That there are such arrangements 
of truths joined to good, is wont to be presented to the very sight in the other life; for in the light of heaven, in which are intelligence and wisdom, such things can be presented to view, though 
not in the light of the world; nor in the light of heaven with the man whose interiors are not open; and yet they may be acknowledged by him from rational insight, and in this way be rationally seen 
from the light of heaven. These arrangings originate from the arrangings of the angelic societies in heaven; for as these are arranged, so are the series of truths joined to good arranged in the regenerate; 
for the latter correspond to the former. </p>

<p align="center"><b>Elliott(1983-1999) 5343</b></p><p><b>5343.</b>
'The food of the field of a city' means that these - the truths linked to good in the interior parts - were proper to and suitable for those interior parts. This is clear from the meaning of 'the food' 
as truths linked to good, dealt with in <a href="5340.htm">5340</a>, <a href="5342.htm">5342</a>. Truths proper to the interior parts and suitable for them are meant by 'the food of the field of a city' for the reason that the field belonged to 
the city and formed the area encircling it. In the internal sense the parts which form an encircling area mean what is suitable and proper. This is also why the statement 'which was round about it he 
laid up in the midst of it' comes next. The reason the parts forming an encircling area mean what is proper to and suitable for is that all truths joined to good exist arranged into series, and the 
nature of these series is such that truth joined to good is positioned in the middle or inmost part of each one; then truths that are proper to and suitable for that middle or inmost part are positioned 
around the same, continuing to the outermost part where the series disappears. </p>
<p></p>
<p><b>[2]</b>
 The actual series too are positioned in relation to one another in a similar kind of way. But such positionings 
vary in keeping with the changes of state that take place. It is quite normal in the next life for such arrangements of truths joined to good to present themselves in a visual manner; for in the light 
of heaven, which holds intelligence and wisdom within it, visual images can be used to present such things. The same cannot be done in the light of the world, nor can it be done in the light of heaven 
if a person's interior parts have not been opened, though he still has the ability to recognize them through rational insights and so see them by the use of reason in the light of heaven. These ordered 
arrangements of truths owe their origin to the ordered arrangements of the angelic communities in heaven; for in whatever way the angelic communities are arranged, so also with regenerate persons 
are the series of truths joined to good arranged, because these series of truths correspond to those angelic communities. </p>

`Cibum agri urbis': quod significet quae propria eis et convenientia, nempe vera bono adjuncta in interioribus, constat ex significatione `cibi' quod sint vera bono adjuncta, de qua n. (x)5340, 5342; 
vera quae propria interioribus et convenientia significantur per `cibum agri urbis' ex causa quia ager pertinebat ad urbem, et ambitum ejus faciebat; quae ambitum faciunt, in sensu interno significant 
convenientia et propria, idcirco etiam mox dicitur `quae circumcirca illam, dedit in medio illius'. Quod illa quae ambitum faciunt, significent propria et convenientia, est quia omnia vera juncta bono 
sunt in series disposita, ac series tales sunt ut in medio seu in intimo cujusvis sit verum junctum bono, et circumcirca hoc medium seu intimum sunt vera propria ei et convenientia, et sic ordine 
usque ad {1}extimum, ubi evanescit; [2] ipsae series etiam inter se similiter dispositae sunt, at variantur secundum status mutationes; quod tales dispositiones {2} verorum bono junctorum sint, ad ipsum 
visum sisti solet in altera vita, in luce enim caeli in qua est intelligentia et sapientia, talia possunt exhiberi videnda, non autem in luce mundi, nec in luce caeli apud hominem apud quem interiora 
non aperta sunt, at usque possunt ab illo ex intuitione rationali agnosci, et sic rationaliter ex luce caeli {3} videri; dispositiones hae originem suam trahunt ex dispositionibus societatum angelicarum 
in caelo, nam sicut {4}hae dispositae sunt, ita quoque dispositae sunt series verorum bono junctorum apud regeneratos, cum illis enim hae correspondent. @1 intimum I$ @2 i seu ordinationes$ @3
