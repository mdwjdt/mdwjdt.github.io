<h3 align="center" class="ired">属天的奥秘 第3226节</h3>
<h4 align="center"></h4><p><strong>3226.</strong> 人所具有的杰出官能之一（尽管他对此一无所知），也就是他摆脱肉体进入来世时带到那里去的官能，就是明白来世所看到的事物是什么意思的能力。他还能凭其心智的感官片刻之内充分表达他在世时数小时都无法表达出来的事。他凭从属于天堂之光的事物所获得的概念而做到这一点；这些概念因添加了代表所讨论主题的可见形像而得以强化，仿佛装上了翅膀，而这些形像都是诸如无法描述的那类形像。由于每个人死后都会进入这些官能，并且在来世无需要接受有关它们的教导，故显而易见，人人都拥有这些事物，也就是说，活在肉身时，这些官能就在他里面，尽管他没有意识到这一点<br />这是因为，对每个人来说，主不断经由天堂流入进来。这流注就是属灵和属天之物的流注，而属灵和属天之物降至他的属世概念，并在那里以代表物的方式显现。对天堂中的天使来说，他们的思维只专注于属于主国度的属天和属灵之物；而对世人来说，除了属于他所在国度和生活必需品的肉体和自然之物外，他的思维几乎不专注于任何事物。由于天上所流入的属灵和属天之物在人的属世概念中以代表物的方式显现，所以它们保持植入状态，并且当人脱去肉体，将尘世抛在身后时，他便在它们里面。</p>

<p align="center"><b>Potts(1905-1910) 3226</b></p><p><b>3226.</b>
Among the eminent faculties which man possesses, although he is ignorant of it, and which he carries with him into the other life when he passes thither after his liberation from the body, is that he 
perceives what is signified by the representatives which appear in the other life; also that he is able by the sense of his mind to express fully in a moment of time what he could not express during 
hours in the body; and this by ideas from those things which are of the light of heaven, assisted and given as it were wings by suitable appearances representative of the subject of discourse, which are 
such as cannot be described; and whereas man after death comes into these faculties, and in the other life has no need to be instructed respecting them, it is evident that he is in them (that is, that 
they are in him) during his life in the body, although he does not know it. [2] The reason of this is that there is a continual influx with man through heaven from the Lord. This influx is an influx 
of spiritual and celestial things, which fall into his natural things and are there presented representatively. In heaven among the angels nothing else is thought of than the celestial and spiritual 
things of the Lord's kingdom; but in the world, with man, scarcely anything else is thought of than the corporeal and natural things which belong to the kingdom in which he is, and to the necessaries 
of life. And since the spiritual and celestial things of heaven which flow in are presented representatively with man in his natural things, they therefore remain implanted, and when a man puts off 
the body and leaves the world behind, he is in them. </p>

Though he is not aware of it, one of the abilities which are present in a person, and which are taken by him into the next life when he passes into that life on his being released from the body, is the 
ability to perceive what is meant by the representatives that are seen in the next life. He is also able intuitively (sensu animi) to express fully within an instant that which he was unable to do 
during his lifetime even if he spent hours over it. He does this by means of ideas gained from the things that belong to the light of heaven; and those ideas are strengthened, being so to speak equipped 
with wings, by the addition of visual images representative of the subject under discussion, images such as defy description. And since everyone enters into those abilities after death and does not 
need to be taught them in the next life, it may therefore be recognized that everyone possesses those things, that is, that those abilities exist within him during his lifetime even though he is not 
aware of this. The reason this is so is that with everyone the Lord is flowing in constantly by way of heaven. That influx is an influx of spiritual and celestial things which come down into his natural 
ideas and there manifest themselves in a representative manner. With angels in heaven their thoughts are fixed solely on celestial and spiritual things which belong to the Lord's kingdom, whereas with 
man in the world his thoughts are fixed on scarcely anything other than the bodily and natural things that constitute the kingdom in which he dwells and the necessities of life which he requires. 
And since the spiritual and celestial things of heaven that flow in manifest themselves in a representative manner in man's natural ideas they therefore remain ingrafted and exist with a person when he 
casts off bodily things and leaves behind worldly things. </p>

Inter facultates eminentes quas homo in se habet, tametsi id nescit, et quas in alteram vitam cum illuc post solutionem a corpore transit, secum fert, est quod repraesentativa quae apparent in altera 
vita, percipiat quid significant; tum quoque quod possit {1}sensu animi sui plene intra momentum temporis exprimere quod per horas nequit in corpore, et id per ideas ex illis quae sunt lucis caeli, 
adjutas {2}et sicut alatas factas per species repraesentativas rei de qua sermo, convenientes, quae tales sunt ut non describi possint: et quia homo post mortem in illas facultates venit, et non opus 
habet ut de illis in altera vita instruatur, inde constare potest quod homo in illis sit, hoc est, quod illa in ipso sint, cura vivit in corpore, tametsi hoc nescit. (m)Quod ita sit, causa est quia apud 
hominem continuus influxus per caelum a Domino est; influxus ille est spiritualium et caelestium, quae cadunt in ejus naturalia ac ibi sistuntur repraesentative; in caelo apud angelos non aliud cogitatur 
quam de caelestibus et spiritualibus quae sunt regni Domini; sed in mundo apud hominem, vix aliud quam de corporeis et naturalibus quae sunt regni in quo est, et necessitatum vitae in quibus; et 
quia spiritualia et caelestia caeli quae influunt, sistuntur repraesentative apud hominem in ejus naturalibus, ideo manent illa insita, ac in illis est homo cum corporea exuit, et mundana {3}reliquit.(n) @1
