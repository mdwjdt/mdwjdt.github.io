<h3 align="center" class="ired">属天的奥秘 第5945节</h3>
<h4 align="center"></h4><p><strong>5945.</strong>“从埃及地带着车辆去”表属记忆知识的教义事物。这从“埃及地”和“车辆”（carts）的含义清楚可知：“埃及地”是指记忆知识，如前所述；“车辆”是指教义事物。在圣言中，凡论述埃及的地方，都会提到战车（Chariots）和马。在那里，“战车”表示教义事物，有时表示假的教义事物，有时表示真的教义事物；而“马”表示理性概念，同样表示真、假两个意义上的。“战车”是指教义事物（参看<a href="5321.htm">5321</a>节）。那里的“车辆”（carts）也一样，只是“车辆”（carts）表示属记忆知识的教义事物。属记忆知识的教义事物是指取自圣言字义的教义，尤其服务于那些第一次被引入教会所拥有的内层真理，就是诸如先向寡妇、孤儿和街上的穷人行善的那类教导之人。其它这类宗教教导则包含在十诫中。这些和许多其它教导就是属记忆知识的教义事物，由“埃及的车辆”来表示。这类教义事物因是一个人最先学到的东西，故后来作为一个基础而服务于他；因为当向更内在的教导发展时，最先学到的这些东西就变成最后和最低的。此外，属天和属灵事物实际上就在它们里面终止，因为它们可以说就立足并停歇于最先学到的教义事物之上。因为灵界可以说有其栽植于自然界的双脚和脚底；就人的属灵生命而言，他也有其栽植在属记忆知识的教义事物之上的双脚。圣言的内义以同样的方式停歇于它的字义之上。表示这些教义事物的“车辆”（carts）只在圣言极少数地方提到。在原文，经上提到了“车辆”这个词，在那里，经上说约柜就放在这样的车辆上（撒母耳记上<a href="http://39-27.cn/撒上6.7.htm">6:7</a>，<a href="http://39-27.cn/撒上6.8.htm">8</a>；撒母耳记下<a href="http://39-27.cn/撒下6.3.htm">6:3</a>）；以及当奉到帐幕前时（民数记<a href="http://39-27.cn/民7.3.htm">7:3</a>）。之所以用这个词，是因为“约柜”表示天堂（<a href="3478.htm">3478</a>节），它就立足并停歇于属记忆知识的教义事物之上。</p>

Take you out of the land of Egypt carts.* That this signifies the doctrinal things of memory-knowledges, is evident from the signification of the "land of Egypt," as being memory-knowledges (of which 
above); and from the signification of "carts," as being doctrinal things. In the Word, where Egypt is treated of, mention is here and there made of chariots and horses, and by "chariots," are there meant 
doctrinal things, sometimes false and sometimes true, and by "horses" are meant intellectual things, also in both senses. That "chariots" are doctrinal things may be seen above (n. 5321). In like 
manner "carts" there, but by these are signified the doctrinal things of memory-knowledges. The doctrinal things of memory-knowledges are doctrinal things from the literal sense of the Word, and are 
especially serviceable to those who are being initiated for the first time into more interior truths of the church, such as that widows, orphans, and the poor in the streets are the especial objects of 
beneficence; and also the precepts of the Decalogue. These and more are doctrinal things of memory-knowledges, and are signified by the "carts of Egypt." Such doctrinal things, being the first that 
a man learns, afterward serve him as an ultimate plane; for when progress is being made to more internal things, they become ultimates. Moreover celestial and spiritual things actually terminate in these, 
for they as it were stand and rest upon them; because the spiritual world has as it were its feet and soles of the feet in the natural world, and with man in respect to his spiritual life has them 
in the doctrinal things of memory-knowledges, in like manner as the internal sense of the Word has them in its literal sense. The "carts" by which these doctrinal things are signified, are not mentioned 
in the Word except in a few passages. A "cart" is mentioned by this word in the original tongue, where it speaks of the ark being laid on such a vehicle (1 Sam. 6:7, 8; 2 Sam. 6:3), and also when 
the tabernacle was sanctified (Num. 7:3). The reason is that the ark represented heaven (n. 3478), which as before said stands and rests upon the doctrinal things of memory-knowledges. * The carts 
of Egypt. These "carts" (Hebrew agalah; Swedenborg vehiculum) were two-wheeled vehicles drawn by cattle, whereas the chariots were drawn by horses. The carts were used for the conveyance of persons, burdens, 
or produce. As there were no roads in Egypt and Palestine, only the simplest wheeled vehicles were possible. These agalah were not wagons, which run on four wheels and are usually drawn by horses. 
They were really a somewhat inferior kind of chariot, less speedy, and usually ruder in construction; and this fact supplies the basis for their correspondence. Agalah is correctly rendered "cart" 
in 1 Sam 6:2; 2 Sam. 6; Isa. 5:18; 28:27, 28. "From time immemorial Egypt was rich in small, two-wheeled carriages, which could be used even where there were no roads (See Gen. 50:9; Exod. 14:6, with 
Isa. 36:9)." (Keil and Delitsch On the Pentateuch.)  See also the interesting article "Cart" in Smith's Dictionary of the Bible, which contains ancient pictorial representations of these "carts," both 
Egyptian and Assyrian, drawn by oxen, and carrying passengers. </p>

'Take for yourselves from the land of Egypt carts' means matters of doctrine belonging to factual knowledge. This is clear from the meaning of 'the land of Egypt' as factual knowledge, dealt with already; 
and from the meaning of 'carts' as matters of doctrine. Chariots and horses are mentioned in various places in the Word where Egypt is the subject. There 'chariots' is used to mean matters of doctrine, 
sometimes false, at other times true ones, while 'horses' is used to mean intellectual concepts, likewise true or false ones. (For the meaning of 'chariots' as matters of doctrine, see <a href="5721.htm">5721</a>.) 
It is similar with 'carts' there, but matters of doctrine belonging to factual knowledge are meant by them. Matters of doctrine belonging to factual knowledge are religious teachings drawn from the literal 
sense of the Word, which serve especially those people who are being introduced for the first time to interior truths that the Church possesses, such as the teaching that good should be done above 
all to widows, to orphans, and to the poor in the streets. Other such religious teachings are contained in the ten commandments. These and many other teachings are matters of doctrine belonging to 
factual knowledge and are meant by 'carts belonging to Egypt'. Because such matters of doctrine are the first to be learned by a person they also serve him subsequently as a groundwork; for when progress 
is made towards more internal teachings those learned first become the last and lowest. Moreover celestial and spiritual realities actually terminate in them, for they stand and rest so to speak on 
the matters of doctrine learned first. Indeed the spiritual world has so to speak its feet and the soles of its feet planted on the natural world; and so far as his spiritual life is concerned a person 
has his feet planted on matters of doctrine that belong to factual knowledge. The internal sense of the Word rests in a similar way on its literal sense. The particular word for 'carts', by which 
those matters of doctrine are meant, occurs in only a few places in the Word. It is used in the original language where it is said that the Ark was placed on one, <a href="http://bible.gospelcom.net/cgi-bin/bible?passage=1%20Sam%206:7;%202&amp;version=ESV&amp;interface=print&amp;showfn=yes&amp;showxref">1 Sam 6:7; 2</a> <a href="http://bible.gospelcom.net/cgi-bin/bible?passage=Sam%206:3&amp;version=ESV&amp;interface=print&amp;showfn=yes&amp;showxref">Sam 6:3</a>; and also when 
the tabernacle was consecrated, <a href="http://bible.gospelcom.net/cgi-bin/bible?passage=Num%207:3&amp;version=ESV&amp;interface=print&amp;showfn=yes&amp;showxref">Num 7:3</a>. The reason for the use of the word is that 'the Ark' represented heaven, <a href="3478.htm">3478</a>, which stands and rests, as has been stated, on matters of doctrine belonging to 
factual knowledge. </p>

`Accipite vobis e terra Aegypti vehicula': quod significet doctrinalia scientificorum, constat ex significatione `terrae Aegypti' quod sint scientifica, de qua prius; et ex significatione `vehiculorum' 
quod sint doctrinalia.  In Verbo ubi agitur de Aegypto, passim nominantur currus et equi, et per `currus' ibi intelliguntur doctrinalia, nunc falsa nunc vera, et per 'equos' intellectualia etiam in 
utroque sensu; quod `currus' sint doctrinalia, videatur n. 5321; similiter vehicula ibi, sed per haec significantur doctrinalia scientificorum; doctrinalia scientificorum sunt doctrinalia ex sensu litterali 
Verbi, ac imprimis inserviunt illis qui primum inaugurantur in vera interiora Ecclesiae; sicut sunt, quod viduis prae ceteris benefaciendum, quod pupillis, quod pauperibus qui in plateis; tum 
quoque praecepta decalogi; haec et plura sunt doctrinalia scientificorum et significantur per `vehicula Aegypti'; talia doctrinalia quia sunt prima quae homo addiscit, etiam dein pro ultimo plano ei 
inserviunt, nam cum progressus fit ad interiora, fiunt ultima; etiam in illis actualiter desinunt caelestia et spiritualia{1}, nam illis quasi insistunt ac innituntur, {2}spiritualis enim mundus habet 
suos quasi pedes et suas plantas in naturali, (c)et apud hominem quoad vitam ejus spiritualem {3} in doctrinalibus scientificorum{4}; similiter ac sensus internus Verbi in sensu ejus litterali. Vehicula 
per quae doctrinalia haec significantur, {5}in Verbo non nisi quam aliquibus in locis nominantur; nominatur vehiculum illa voce in lingua originali, ubi agitur de arca quod imposita tali, 1 Sam. vi 
7, 2 Sam. vi 3; et quoque cum {6}sanctificabatur habitaculum, Num. vii 3; causa est quia `arca' repraesentabat caelum, n. 3478, quod, ut dictum, insistit ac innititur doctrinalibus scientificorum. @1
