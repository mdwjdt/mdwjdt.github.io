<h3 align="center" class="ired">属天的奥秘 第7352节</h3>
<h4 align="center"></h4><p><strong>7352.</strong>“这河要使青蛙爬行”表由这些虚假所生的推理。这从“埃及河”和“青蛙”的含义清楚可知：“埃及河”是指虚假（参看<a href="6693.htm">6693</a>，<a href="7307.htm">7307</a>节）；“青蛙”是指推理（参看<a href="7351.htm">7351</a>节）。“青蛙”之所以是指推理，是因为它们生活在水中，在那里制造喋喋不休的噪音和蛙鸣，还生活在污秽的环境中。至于何为由纯粹的虚假所产生的推理，这可通过几个例子来说明。一个人若将一切事物都归于自然界，几乎不将任何东西归于神性，就是在出于纯粹的虚假进行推理；而事实是，一切事物皆因神性而存在，自然界仅仅是神性作工所用的工具性手段。一个人若以为人就像一个动物，只是更完美，因为他能思考，因此以为人会像动物一样死去，就是在出于纯粹的虚假进行推理。由于他不肯相信人通过属于信的思维和属于爱的情感与神性结合，从而不肯相信复活和永生，所以这种人出于纯粹的虚假说话。人若以为地狱不存在，也是一样。他若以为人所拥有的一切就是这个世界的生活的快乐，并因此享受这快乐，因为当他死亡时，就完全死了，同样如此。人若以为一切事皆依赖于他自己的精明和好运气，而不是依赖于神的旨意，除非在一个很普遍的层面上，就是在出于纯粹的虚假进行推理。他若以为宗教的存在没有其它原因，只是为了控制简单人，也是如此。那些以为圣言不是神性的人尤其出于纯粹的虚假进行推理。</p>

And the river shall make frogs to creep forth. That this signifies that there will be reasonings from these falsities, is evident from the signification of "the river of Egypt," as being falsity (see 
n. 6693, 7307); and from the signification of "frogs," as being reasonings (as above, n. 7351). That "frogs" denote reasonings is because they are in waters, where they make a chattering noise and croak, 
and are also among things unclean. What reasoning from mere falsities is, shall be illustrated by some examples. That man reasons from mere falsities who attributes all things to nature, and scarcely 
anything to the Divine; when yet all things are from the Divine, and nature is only the instrumental means by which the Divine works. He reasons from mere falsities who believes that man is like 
a beast, only more perfect, because he can think; and thus that man will die like a beast; by thus denying the conjunction of man with the Divine through the thought which is of faith, and the affection 
which is of love, and hence his resurrection and life eternal, such a man speaks from mere falsities. In like manner is he who believes that there is no hell. And also he who believes that all a man 
has is the delight of this world's life, and therefore he must enjoy this, because when he dies, he dies altogether. He reasons from mere falsities who believes that all things depend upon his own sagacity, 
and on fortune; and not on the Divine Providence, except such as is universal. And also he who believes that religion is good for nothing except to keep the simple in bonds. Especially do they 
reason from mere falsities who believe that the Word is not Divine. In short, all those reason from mere falsities who utterly deny truths Divine. </p>

'And the river will cause the frogs to crawl forth' means the reasonings arising from those falsities. This is clear from the meaning of 'the river of Egypt' as falsity, dealt with in <a href="6693.htm">6693</a>, <a href="7307.htm">7307</a>; and 
from the meaning of 'the frogs' as reasonings, dealt with immediately above in <a href="7351.htm">7351</a>. The reason why 'frogs' are reasonings is that they live in water, in which they make talkative sounds and croak, and 
also live in unclean surroundings. What reasoning arising from utter falsities is will be illustrated by several examples. Reasoning arising from utter falsities takes place if a person attributes 
everything to natural forces and scarcely anything to the Divine, when in fact everything owes its existence to the Divine, and natural forces are merely the means by which it is brought into being. Reasoning 
arising from utter falsities takes place if a person believes that a human being is similar to an animal, being more perfect only by virtue of his ability to think, and for this reason believes 
that when he dies a human being is similar to an animal. Because he refuses to believe that a human being is linked to the Divine through thought which belongs to faith, and through affection which 
belongs to love, and as a consequence refuses to believe in resurrection and eternal life, what he says arises from utter falsities. It is similar with a person who believes that hell has no existence, 
and also with him who believes that a person has the pleasurable gift of life only while he is in the world and should therefore take full advantage of it, because when he dies he dies completely. 
Reasoning arising from utter falsities takes place if a person believes that all things are attributable to one's own prudence and good fortune, and not to Divine Providence except on a very general level. 
It also takes place if a person believes that religion exists for no other reason than to keep the simple in check. Reasoning arising from utter falsities takes place in particular if people believe 
that the Word is not Divine. In short reasoning arising from utter falsities takes place if people refuse completely to believe God's truths. </p>

`Et prorepere faciet fluvius ranas': quod significet ratiocinia ex falsis illis, constat (c)a significatione `fluvii Aegypti' quod sit falsum, de qua n. 6693, 7307; et ex significatione `ranarum' quod 
sit ratiocinia, de qua mox supra n. 7351; quod `ranae' sint ratiocinia, est quia in aquis sunt, {1} et ibi garrule sonant, (c)et coaxant, {2}et sunt quoque inter immunda.  Quid ratiocinatio ex meris 
falsis, per aliquot exempla illustrabitur: ex meris falsis ratiocinatur qui omnia naturae tribuit et vix aliquid Divino, cum tamen omnia ex Divino sunt, et natura est modo instrumentale per quod: ex 
meris falsis ratiocinatur qui credit quod homo sit sicut bestia, modo {3} perfectior quia cogitare potest, et sic quod homo moriturus sit sicut bestia; is quia negat conjunctionem hominis cum Divino 
per {4}cogitationem quae fidei, et per affectionem quae amoris, et inde negat resurrectionem et vitam aeternam, ex meris falsis loquitur: similiter qui credit quod non infernum sit: tum quoque qui credit 
quod homo non plus habeat quam jucundum vitae cum est in mundo, et ideo quod illo fructurus sit, quia cum moritur prorsus moritur: ex meris falsis ratiocinatur qui credit quod omnia sint prudentiae 
propriae ac fortunae, non autem Providentiae Divinae nisi quae universalis: {5}ut et qui credit quod religio non aliud sit quam ut simplices {6}teneantur in vinculis: imprimis ex {7}meris falsis ratiocinantur 
qui credunt quod Verbum non sit Divinum: in summa, omnes illi ex meris falsis ratiocinantur qui vera Divina prorsus negant. 	@1 i per quas significantur inferiora vera, et in opposito sensu
