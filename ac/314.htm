<p><strong>[NCE]314.</strong> Our Entry into Eternal Life (Continued)<br />AFTER our revived selves — our souls — have been restored to the light, so that we can look around us, the spiritual angels mentioned before [<a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_314/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_182" target=_top>182</a>] perform every service for us that we can possibly desire in our new state. They teach us about the things that exist in the other life, but only so far as we can comprehend. To anyone who had been a believer and has an interest they also show the grand and amazing sights of heaven. </p>

CONTINUATION CONCERNING MAN'S ENTRANCE INTO ETERNAL LIFE. After the use of light has been given to the resuscitated person, or soul, so that he can look about him, the spiritual angels previously spoken 
of render him all the kindly services he can in that state desire, and give him information about the things of the other life, but only so far as he is able to receive it. If he has been in faith, 
and desires it, they show him the wonderful and magnificent things of heaven. </p>

MAN'S ENTRY INTO ETERNAL LIFE - continued  </p>
<p>After an awakened person, that is, a soul, has been provided with the benefit of light so that he is able to look around him, the spiritual angels mentioned 
already render him every kindly service he could possibly wish for in that state. They also tell him about the things that exist in the next life, but only insofar as he is able to take it in. If 
he has had faith, and if he desires it, they also show him the marvels and splendours of heaven.  </p>

CONTINUATIO DE INTROITU HOMINIS IS VITAM AETERNAM </p>
<p>ANGELI spirituales, de quibus prius, postquam data resuscitato seu animae lucis usura ut se circumspicere possit, ei omnia officia quae usquam desiderare 
in illo statu potest, praestant; ac instruunt eum de illis quae sunt in altera vita, sed quantum capere potest: si in fide fuit, et desiderat, etiam ei mirabilia et magnifica caeli ostendunt. </p>
