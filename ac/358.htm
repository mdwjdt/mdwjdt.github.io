<h4 align="center"></h4><p><strong>358.</strong>“脸沉了下来”表内在的变化，这一点从“脸”和“沉下”的意思明显可知。古人用“脸”来表示内在之物，因为内在的东西会从脸上透露出来；上古之人的表情与内在完全一致，以致于看一个人的脸就能知道他的性情或心情如何。他们视表面一套，心里一套为骇人之事。伪装与欺骗在那时被认为是可憎的，因此，内在之物用“脸”来表示。当仁从脸上发出，就说脸“仰”起来；反之，则说脸“沉”下来。这也解释了为什么主赐福时就说祂“向人仰脸”（民数记<a href="http://39-27.cn/民6.26.htm">6:26</a>；诗篇<a href="http://39-27.cn/诗4.6.htm">4:6</a>），这表示主赐人以仁。<br />“脸沉下来”的意思从耶利米书的经文可以看出来：<br />耶和华说：“我将不向你们沉下脸来，因为我是慈爱的。”（耶利米书<a href="http://39-27.cn/耶3.12.htm">3:12</a>）<br />“耶和华的脸”表慈爱（或慈悲），当祂向人“仰起脸”时，意味着祂出于慈悲而赐人以仁；当祂“沉下脸”（有时译作“变脸”），也就是人的脸沉下来时，情况刚好相反。</p>

<p><strong>[NCE]358.</strong> The meaning of his face fell as a change at the deeper levels can be established by the symbolism of the face and of falling. Among the ancients the face symbolized the inner depths, because those depths shine out through the face. People's nature in earliest times was such that the face was in complete harmony with what was inside, so that everyone could see in another's face what that other's temperament or mind was like. They considered it heinous to show one thing on the face while thinking another. In those days pretense and fraud were abhorrent. As a result, the face symbolized inner things. When charity shone out from the face, the face was said to be lifted, but when the opposite was true, the face was said to fall. This is also why the Lord is said to lift his face on us (as in the blessing from <a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_358/bible_king-james-version_numbers_6_26" target=_top>Numbers 6:26</a> and <a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_358/bible_king-james-version_psalms_4_6" target=_top>Psalms 4:6</a>), meaning that the Lord gives us the capacity to love others.{*1} What the falling of the face is can be seen in Jeremiah:<br />"I will not make my face fall toward you, because I am merciful," says Jehovah. (<a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_358/bible_king-james-version_jeremiah_3_12" target=_top>Jeremiah 3:12</a>)<br />Jehovah's face is mercy. When he lifts his face on anyone, the meaning is that in his mercy he gives that person the gift of charity. The opposite occurs when he makes his face fall — that is, when a person's own face falls.<br /><br /><strong>Footnotes:</strong><br />{*1} <a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_358/bible_king-james-version_numbers_6_26" target=_top>Numbers 6:26</a> says, "May Jehovah lift his face on you and give you peace." <a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_358/bible_king-james-version_psalms_4_6" target=_top>Psalms 4:6</a> says, "Lift the light of your face on us, Jehovah."

That by the "faces falling" is signified that the interiors were changed, is evident from the signification of the "face" and of its "falling." The face, with the ancients, signified internal things, 
because internal things shine forth through the face; and in the most ancient times men were such that the face was in perfect accord with the internals, so that from a man's face everyone could see 
of what disposition or mind he was. They considered it a monstrous thing to show one thing by the face and think another. Simulation and deceit were then considered detestable, and therefore the things 
within were signified by the face. When charity shone forth from the face, the face was said to be "lifted up;" and when the contrary occurred, the face was said to "fall;" wherefore it is also predicated 
of the Lord that He "lifts up His faces upon man" as in the benediction (Num. 6:26; and in Ps. 4:6), by which is signified that the Lord gives charity to man. What is meant by the "face falling" 
appears from Jeremiah: </p>
<p>     I will not make My face to fall toward you, for I am merciful, saith Jehovah (Jer. 3:12). The "face of Jehovah" is mercy, and when He "lifts up His face" upon anyone, it 
signifies that out of mercy He gives him charity; and the reverse when He "makes the face to fall" that is, when man's face falls. </p>

'The face<A name="fntext1"></a><A href="#fn1"><sup>a</sup></a> falling' means change taking place as to interiors. This is clear from the meaning of 'the face' and from the meaning of 'falling'. Among the ancients the face meant internal things, for it 
is through the face that internal things shine forth. What is more, people in most ancient limes were such that the face was in complete accord with internal things, so that anyone could see from another 
person's face the character of his disposition or mind (animus aut mens). They considered it something monstrous to express one thing in the face and to be thinking another; pretence and deceit 
in those times were abhorrent. Consequently the face meant things that were internal. When charity shone out of the face, the face was said to be 'lifted up', but when the reverse happened the face was 
said to 'fall'. This also explains why the Lord is referred to as lifting up His face upon man, as in the Blessing in <a href="http://bible.gospelcom.net/cgi-bin/bible?passage=Num%206:26&amp;version=ESV&amp;interface=print&amp;showfn=yes&amp;showxref">Num 6:26</a> and <a href="http://bible.gospelcom.net/cgi-bin/bible?passage=Ps%204:6&amp;version=ESV&amp;interface=print&amp;showfn=yes&amp;showxref">Ps 4:6</a>, which means the Lord's gift of charity to man. What 'the 
falling of the face' means is clear in Jeremiah,  </p>
<blockquote>
I will not cause My face to fall upon you, for I am merciful, said Jehovah. <a href="http://bible.gospelcom.net/cgi-bin/bible?passage=Jer%203:12&amp;version=ESV&amp;interface=print&amp;showfn=yes&amp;showxref">Jer 3:12</a>.  
</blockquote>
<p>By 'Jehovah's face' is meant mercy. When He 'lifts up His 
face' on anyone, He is from His mercy imparting charity to him. The reverse is the case when He 'causes His face to fall', that is, when man's face falls.

Quod per 'cadere facies' significetur quod interiora mutentur, etiam a significatione 'faciei' et significatione 'cadere' constat; facies apud antiquos significavit interna, quia per faciem interna 
elucent; tales etiam antiquissimis temporibus fuerunt ut facies prorsus concordaret cum internis, sic ut quisque ex facie videre potuisset qualis animus aut mens ejus esset; pro enormi re ducebant aliud 
facie ostendere, aliud cogitare; simulatio et dolus tunc fuit abominabilis; quare per 'faciem' significabantur interna; cum charitas elucebat ex facie, tunc dicebatur 'elevari facies'; cum autem contrarium, 
tunc dicebatur 'facies cadere'; quare etiam de Domino praedicatur quod 'facies elevet super hominem,' ut in Benedictione, Num. vi 26; et Ps. iv 7 [A.V. 6], quo significatur quod Dominus det 
homini charitatem: quid cadere facies, constat apud Jeremiam, 	Non faciam cadere faciem Meam erga vos, quoniam misericors Ego, dictum Jehovae, iii 12; </p>
<p>'facies Jehovae' est misericordia; cum 'elevat 
faciem' super aliquem, est quod ex misericordia ei charitatem det: contrarium est cum 'facit cadere faciem,' hoc est, cum homini facies cadit. </p>
