<h3 align="center" class="ired">属天的奥秘 第4005节</h3>
<h4 align="center"></h4><p><strong>4005.</strong>“当日，拉班把有纹的、有点的公山羊都挑出来”表那些散布于邪恶与虚假当中并与其混杂的良善之真理被单独挑出来，它们属于“拉班”所表示的良善。这从“挑出来”、“公山羊”、“纹”和“斑”的含义清楚可知：“挑出来”是指单独挑出来；“公山羊”是指良善之真理，如下文所述；“纹”（party-colored）是指散布于邪恶当中并与其混杂的事物，也如下所述；“斑”是指散布于虚假当中并与其混杂的事物，如前所述。此处之所以先提及“公山羊”，然后提及“母山羊”，是因为“公山羊”表示良善之真理，“母山羊”表示真理之良善；这二者之间的区别如前所述（<a href="3995.htm">3995</a>节）。<br />在圣言中，公和母被仔细区分开来，这一点从祭物和燔祭明显看出来，因为经上明确规定了当献的是公羔羊还是母羔羊，是母山羊还是公山羊，是母绵羊还是公绵羊等等。由此清楚可知，公表示一种事物，母则表示另一种事物。一般来说，“公”表示真理，“母”表示良善。故此处“公山羊”表示良善之真理，随后提到的“母山羊”表示与这些真理结合的良善。公与母之间的这种区别也解释了为何经上说他把有纹的公山羊挑出来，而不像母山羊那样，把有点的挑出来；因为“纹”表示散布于邪恶当中并与其混杂的真理；而“点”（speckled）表示散布于邪恶当中并与其混杂的良善（<a href="3993.htm">3993</a>节）。准确来说，与邪恶混杂的真理属于理解或认知，而与邪恶混杂的良善属于意愿。这就是二者彼此间的区别。它们都出自“拉班”所表示的良善，这一点从公山羊和母山羊都取自拉班羊群的事实明显可知。因为在圣言中，“羊群”表示良善与真理，或也可说，表示那些处于良善与真理的人，因而表示那些属于主教会的人。<br />这个奥秘无法进一步予以解释，因为它无法清晰呈现给尚未在良善与真理上得到指教，同时得到启示的心智。事实上，人必须知道何为 良善之真理，源它们的是哪种良善，以及这一事实：如此众多的各种事物是从此处拉班所代表的这种良善当中单独挑出来的。对这些事一无所知的人不知道每种良善都包含无数事物，事实上所包含的事物如此众多，以致连最有学问的人也几乎无法将它们分门别类。因为既有通过真理所获得的良善，以及由这些良善所生的真理；也有反过来又通过这些真理所获得的良善；还有从良善所生的真理，这些真理也是以一个系列而存在的。既有与邪恶混杂的良善，也有与虚假混杂的真理，如前所述（<a href="3993.htm">3993</a>节）；它们的这种混杂和相互调和如此各异，并且多种多样，以至于数不胜数。它们也照着人们所经历的一切生命状态而各异，而生命的这些状态一般照着这些人的年纪，尤其照着他们的各种情感而各异。由此可在某种程度上明白，如此众多的各种事物能从“拉班”的良善中被挑选出来；其中有一些与雅各的儿子们所表示的真理联结；有一些则被留下；其它的便源于这些留下的。不过，如前所述，这些事具有这样的性质，它们无法被理解，除非心智在良善与真理上得到指教，同时得到启示。</p>

<p align="center"><b>Potts(1905-1910) 4005</b></p><p><b>4005.</b>
And he removed that day the he-goats that were party-colored and spotted. That this signifies that those truths of good were separated that were scattered over and mingled with the evils and falsities 
that were proper to the good signified by "Laban," is evident from the signification of "removing," as being to separate; and from the signification of "he-goats," as being the truths of good (concerning 
which below); and from the signification of "party-colored," as being things scattered over and mingled with evils (concerning which also in what follows); and from the signification of "spotted," 
as being things that are scattered over and mingled with falsities (concerning which above). "He-goats" are here mentioned, and then "she-goats," for the reason that "he-goats" [capri] signify the 
truths of good; and "she-goats," the goods of truth; the difference between which is described above (n. 3995).  [2] An accurate distinction is made in the Word between the males and the females, as 
is evident from the sacrifices and burnt-offerings, in relation to which a specific command was given as to what should be offered, whether a he-lamb or a she-lamb, whether a she-goat or a he-goat, whether 
a sheep or a ram, and so on; from all which it may be seen that one thing was signified by the male, and another by the female. By the "male" in general is signified truth; and by the "female" good. 
Here therefore by the "he-goats" are signified the truths of good; and by the "she-goats" presently mentioned, the goods that are adjoined to them. And as the difference between these is of such 
a nature, it is also said that he removed the party-colored he-goats, but not the speckled ones, as is said of the she-goats; for "party-colored" signifies truth scattered over and mingled with evils; 
whereas "speckled" signifies good scattered over and mingled with evils (see n. 3993). Truth mingled with evils is properly of the understanding, but good mingled with evils is properly of the will. 
This is the difference. That all these are from the good signified by "Laban" is evident, because they were from Laban's flock; for by a "flock" in the Word is signified good and truth, or what is the 
same, those who are in good and truth, and who are therefore of the Lord's church.  [3] This arcanum cannot be explained further, because it cannot become plain except to an apprehension instructed 
in truths and goods, and at the same time enlightened. For it must be known what the truths of good are, and what the goods that are from them; and also that from the one good here represented by Laban 
so many various things can be separated. They who have no knowledge of these subjects do not know that in every good there are innumerable things, so many in fact that they can scarcely be classified 
into general kinds by the most learned man. For there are goods that are procured by means of truths; there are truths born from these goods; and again goods procured by means of these truths. There 
are also truths born of goods, and this also in a series; there are goods that are mingled with evils; and truths that are mingled with falsities, as described above (n. 3993); and the minglings and 
temperings of these are so various and manifold as to exceed myriads of myriads; and they are also varied according to all the states of life; and the states of life are varied in general in accordance 
with the man's age, and specifically in accordance with his affections of all kinds. From this it may in some measure be apprehended that from the good of Laban there could be separated so many various 
things; of which some were adjoined to the truths signified by the sons of Jacob; some were left behind; and from these others were derived. But as before said these things are of such a nature as 
not to fall into the understanding unless it is instructed and at the same time enlightened. </p>

'And he removed on that day the variegated and spotted he-goats' means that the truths of good that were interspersed among and mingled with the evils and falsities belonging to the good meant by 'Laban' 
were singled out. This is clear from the meaning of 'removing' as singling out; from the meaning of 'he-goats' as the truths of good, dealt with below; from the meaning of 'variegated' as those which 
were interspersed among and mingled with evils, also dealt with below; and from the meaning of 'spotted' as those which were interspersed among and mingled with falsities, dealt with above. 'He-goats' 
are mentioned here and then 'she-goats' after them because 'he-goats' means the truths of good and 'she-goats' the goods of truth. For the nature of the difference between the two, see above in <a href="3995.htm">3995</a>. </p>
<p></p>
<p><b>[2]</b>
 In the Word a careful distinction is made between the males and the females, as is evident from the sacrifices and the burnt offerings in which it was explicitly laid down whether a male 
lamb was to be offered or a ewe-lamb, a she-goat or a he-goat, a sheep or a ram, and so on. From these it becomes clear that one thing was meant by a male, another by a female. In general a male means 
truth and a female good. Here therefore 'he-goats' is used to mean the truths of good, and 'she-goats', mentioned immediately after, to mean the forms of good which are coupled with those truths. And 
this difference between males and females also explains why it is said that he removed the variegated he-goats but not, as in the reference to the she-goats, the speckled ones; for 'variegated' means 
truth interspersed among and mingled with evils, whereas 'speckled' means good interspersed among and mingled with them, dealt with above in <a href="3993.htm">3993</a>. Truth mingled with evils belongs specifically to the 
understanding, but good mingled with evils specifically to the will. This is how the two differ from each other. And they come from the good meant by 'Laban', as is evident from the fact that the he-goats 
and the she-goats were taken from Laban's flock. For 'a flock' in the Word means good and truth, or what amounts to the same, those in whom good and truth are present, and so those who belong to 
the Lord's Church. </p>
<p></p>
<p><b>[3]</b>
 This arcanum is unable to be explained any further because it cannot become clear except to a mind that has been taught about truths and goods, and at the same time has been 
enlightened. Indeed one has to know what the truths of good are and what the kinds of good originating in these are, as well as the fact that from the one kind of good represented here by Laban so many 
varying forms of it can be singled out. Nor do people who are unaware of these matters know that each kind of good includes countless forms of it, so many indeed that these can hardly be arranged into 
general divisions by even the most knowledgeable mind. For there are forms of good which are acquired by means of truths, truths which are born from those forms of good, and forms of good acquired 
in turn by means of these truths. There are truths born from forms of good, which also exist in a connected series. Then there are forms of good mingled with evils, and truths with falsities, dealt with 
above in <a href="3993.htm">3993</a>, the minglings and mutual modifications of which are so varying and manifold that they exceed many millions. These are also made various by all the states of life through which people 
pass, and these states of life in general by the time of life which those people have reached, in particular by whatever affections reign in them. From all this one can comprehend to some extent that 
so many varying things were able to be singled out from 'Laban' good, some of which were joined to the truths meant by the sons of Jacob, and some left behind from which others were derived. But as 
has been stated, these matters are of such a nature that they cannot be understood unless the mind has been taught about goods and truths and has at the same time been enlightened. </p>

`Et removit in die isto capros variegatos et maculosos': </p>
<p>quod significet quod separarentur vera boni quae sparsa et mixta malis et falsis, quae propria bono per Labanem significato, constat ex significatione 
`removere' quod sit separare; ex significatione `caprorum' quod sint vera boni, de qua sequitur; ex significatione `variegatorum' quod sint quae sparsa et mixta malis, de qua etiam sequitur; 
et ex significatione `maculosorum' quod sint quae sparsa et mixta falsis, de qua supra.  Hic nominantur capri et dein caprae, ex causa quia `capri' significavit vera boni et `caprae' bona veri, 
inter quae qualis differentia sit, videatur supra n. 3995.  [2] In Verbo accurata distinctio fit inter masculos et femellas, ut patet a sacrificiis et holocaustis, in quibus specifice mandatum 
{1}quod offerretur sive agnus vel agna, sive capra vel caper, sive ovis vel aries, et sic porro; ex {2}quibus constare potest quod aliud significatum fuerit per masculum et aliud per femellam; per 
masculum in genere significatur verum et per femellam bonum; hic itaque per `capros' vera boni, et per `capras,' quae mox nominantur, bona quae illis adjuncta; et quia talis differentia est, etiam 
dicitur quod `removerit capros variegatos,' non autem punctatos prout de capris; `variegatum' enim significat verum sparsum et mixtum malis, at `punctatum' significat bonum sparsum et mixtum malis, 
de quo supra n. 3993; verum mixtum malis, est proprie intellectus, sed bonum mixtum malis est proprie voluntatis; haec differentia est.  Quod haec a bono per Labanem significato sint, patet quia a 
grege Labanis; per `gregem' enim in Verbo significatur bonum et verum, seu quod idem, illi qui in bono et vero sunt, ita qui {3}ab Ecclesia Domini.  [3] Arcanum hoc ulterius exponi nequit quia non 
patere potest nisi ad captum instructum de veris et bonis, et simul illustratum; sciendum eram est quid vera boni, et quid bona inde, tum quod ex uno bono, quod hic per Labanem repraesentatur, tot 
varia possint separari; qui non in cognitione de his sunt, nec sciunt quod in unoquovis bono sint innumerabilia, et quidem tot ut vix possint a scientissimo in communia genera dispesci; sunt enim 
bona comparata per vera, sunt vera inde nata, et per haec iterum bona comparata; sunt vera nata ex bonis, et hoc quoque in serie; sunt bona mixta malis, et vera mixta falsis, de quibus supra n. 3993; 
et horum mixtiones et temperaturae tam variae et multiplices ut myriadum myriades excedant, et quoque variantur secundum omnes vitae status, et vitae status in genere secundum aetates, et in specie 
secundum affectiones quascumque: inde aliquantum capi potest quod a Labanis bono separari potuerint tot varia; {4}quorum quaedam adjuncta sunt veris (t)per filios Jacobi significatis, quaedam relicta, 
et ex his alia derivata: sed haec talia sunt, ut dictum, quae non cadunt in intellectum nisi instructum et simul illustratum. @1 quid$ @2 quo$ @3 i sunt$ @4 et quaedam adjungi$ </p>
