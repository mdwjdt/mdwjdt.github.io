<h3 align="center" class="ired">属天的奥秘 第2101节</h3>
<h4 align="center"></h4><p><strong>2101.</strong>“无论是在家里生的，是用银子买的，就是亚伯拉罕家人中的一切男子”表那些具有与良善结合的信之真理的教会中人。这从“家里生的”、“银子买的”和“男子”的含义清楚可知：“家里生的”是指属天之人，“银子买的”是指属灵之人，这些人都是教会中人（参看<a href="2048.htm">2048</a>，<a href="2051.htm">2051</a>，<a href="2052.htm">2052</a>节）；“男子”是指那些拥有信之真理的人（参看<a href="2046.htm">2046</a>节）。由此明显可知，他们是指具有与良善结合的信之真理的教会中人。</p>

All that were born in his house, and all that were bought with his silver, every male among the men of Abraham's house. That this signifies those who are within the church, with whom the truths of faith 
are conjoined with goods, is evident from the signification of "those born in the house," as being the celestial; from the signification of "those bought with silver," as being the spiritual; and 
from these being within the church, as explained above (n. 2048, 2051, 2052); and also from the signification of a "male," as being those who are in the truth of faith (spoken of above, n. 2046), from 
all which it is evident that they are meant who are within the church, with whom the truths of faith are conjoined with goods. </p>

<p align="center"><b>Elliott(1983-1999) 2101</b></p><p><b>2101.</b>
'All born in his house, and everyone purchased with his silver, and every male among the men of Abraham's house' means those inside the Church in whom truths of faith have been joined to goods. This 
is clear from the meaning of 'those born in the house' as celestial people, from the meaning of 'those bought with silver' as spiritual people - these being people inside the Church, dealt with above 
in <a href="2048.htm">2048</a>, <a href="2051.htm">2051</a>, <a href="2052.htm">2052</a>; and also from the meaning of 'male' as those who possess the truth of faith, also dealt with above in <a href="2046.htm">2046</a>. From what appears in those paragraphs it is evident that people inside 
the Church are meant with whom truths of faith have been joined to goods. </p>

`Omnes natos domus suae, et omnem emptionem argenti sui, omnem masculum in viris domus Abrahami': quod significet illos qui intra Ecclesiam quibus vera fidei conjuncta bonis, constat a significatione 
`natorum domus' quod sint caelestes, a significatione `emptorum argento' quod sint spirituales, et quod ii intra Ecclesiam sint, de quibus supra n. 2048, 2051, 2052; tum a significatione `masculi' quod 
sint qui in vero fidei, de qua etiam supra n. 2046; ex quibus patet quod sint illi qui intra Ecclesiam, penes quos vera fidei conjuncta bonis. </p>
