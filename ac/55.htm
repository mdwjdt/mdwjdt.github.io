<h3 align="center" class="ired">属天的奥秘 第55节</h3>
<h4 align="center"></h4><p><strong>55.</strong>创世记1:28 神就赐福给他们，又对他们说：“要繁殖增多，遍满地面，治理这地，也要管理海里的鱼、空中的鸟，和地上各样行动的活物。”<br />上古之人将觉性与意志的结合，或者信与爱的结合，称为一个“婚姻”。该婚姻产生良善，他们称之为“繁殖”，产生真理，他们称之为“增多”。在先知书中也是如此，例如：“以色列山哪……我必使人和牲畜在你上面增多，他们必增多繁殖，我必使你们有人居住，像古时一样，并要赐福与你，比先前更多，你就知道我是耶和华。我必使人，就是我的民以色列，行在你上面。”（以西结书<a href="http://39-27.cn/结36.8.htm">36:8</a>-<a href="http://39-27.cn/结36.12.htm">12</a>）在此，“人”指属灵者，也被称为“以色列”，“古时”指上古教会，“先前”指洪水后的古教会，“增多”（关乎真理）在“繁殖”（关乎良善）之前，因此处描述的是重生中人，而非已重生之人。<br />当觉性与意志，或说信与爱，在人内里合一，主就称其为“有夫之妇”：“你必不再称为撇弃的，你的地也不再称为荒凉的，你却要称为我所喜悦的，你的地也必称为有夫之妇。因为耶和华喜悦你，你的地也必归他。”（以赛亚书<a href="http://39-27.cn/赛62.4.htm">62:4</a>）从该婚姻所出的真理之果被称为“儿子”，所出的良善之果被称为“女儿”，这种说法在圣经中十分常见。<br />当真理与良善不断增长，“地面”就“遍满”，因为当主给人“赐福”时，良善与真理就无可限量地增长，正如主说：“天堂好像一粒芥菜种，有人拿去种在田里。这原是百种里最小的，等到长起来，却比各样的草本都大，且成了树，天上的飞鸟来宿在它的枝上。”（马太福音<a href="http://39-27.cn/太13.31.htm">13:31</a>，<a href="http://39-27.cn/太13.32.htm">32</a>）<br />“芥菜种”指人成为属灵者之前所拥有的良善，它是“百种里最小的”，因为人以为他是凭自己行善，而事实上，人凭自己所行的一切无非是恶。但在重生的过程中，人开始拥有一丝良善。此后，当信与爱逐步结合，它就不断成长，成为一棵“草本”。最后，当结合完成，它就成了一棵“树”，“天上的飞鸟”（在此亦表真理或正见）“来宿在它的枝上”（表知识）。当人尚是属灵者，或正成为属灵者，冲突势所难免，故此处说：“治理这地，也要管理。”</p>

<p><strong>[NCE]55.</strong> <a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_55/bible_king-james-version_genesis_1_28" target=_top>Genesis 1:28</a>. And God blessed them, and God said to them, "Reproduce and multiply, and fill the earth and harness it, and rule over the fish of the sea and over the bird in the heavens and over every living animal creeping on the earth."<br />The earliest people called the interconnection of intellect and will or of faith and love a marriage, so the generation of any good from that marriage they termed reproduction, and the generation of any truth they termed multiplication. Because they did so, the prophets did so too; in Ezekiel, for instance:<br />I will multiply human and animal upon you, [mountains of Israel,] and they will multiply and reproduce; and I will cause you to live as in your ancient times. And I will do good to you beyond that at your beginnings, and you will know that I am Jehovah. And I will cause humankind — my people Israel — to walk upon you. (<a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_55/bible_king-james-version_ezekiel_36_8" target=_top>Ezekiel 36:8</a>, <a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_55/bible_king-james-version_ezekiel_36_9" target=_top>9</a>, <a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_55/bible_king-james-version_ezekiel_36_10-11" target=_top>10-11</a>, <a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_55/bible_king-james-version_ezekiel_36_12" target=_top>12</a>)<br />Humankind here means the spiritual being, which is also called Israel; the ancient times mean the very earliest church; and the beginnings mean the ancient church, which followed the Flood. The multiplying (of truth) comes before the reproducing (of good) because these verses describe the person who is being reborn, not the one who has been reborn already.<br />[2] When the intellect couples with the will in us, or faith with love, the Lord through Isaiah calls us a married land:<br />No longer will your land be named Devastated; but you will be called I Am Well Pleased with Her, and your land, Married, since Jehovah will take pleasure in you. And your land will be married. (<a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_55/bible_king-james-version_isaiah_62_4" target=_top>Isaiah 62:4</a>)<br />The fruits of truth produced by this marriage are called sons, while the fruits of goodness are called daughters, as occurs quite often in the Word.<br />[3] The earth is filled when truth and goodness proliferate, because when the Lord blesses and says things (that is, operates), goodness and truth grow beyond measure. As he states:<br />The kingdom of the heavens is like a mustard seed that you have taken and sown in your field, which to be sure is the smallest of all the seeds; but when it has grown, it is bigger than all the plants and becomes a tree, so that the birds of the sky come and nest in its branches. (<a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_55/bible_king-james-version_matthew_13_31-32" target=_top>Matthew 13:31-32</a>)<br />The mustard seed is the good we have before developing a spiritual orientation; it is the smallest of all the seeds, because we suppose that we do good on our own. Anything we do on our own is evil through and through, but since we are engaged in the process of being reborn, we have a trace — the smallest possible trace — of goodness.<br />[4] Later, as faith becomes more closely connected with love, it grows larger — a plant. When the connection is completed, it turns into a tree, and then the birds of the heavens (which here as before [<a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_55/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_11" target=_top>11</a>; <a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_55/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_40" target=_top>40:1</a>, <a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_55/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_3" target=_top>3</a>; <a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_55/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_48" target=_top>48</a>] are true ideas, or the contents of the intellect) nest in its branches (the facts we know).<br />When we are spiritual people or are becoming spiritual, we are subject to conflict; and this is why it says harness the earth, and rule. </p>

Verse 28. And God blessed them, and God said unto them, Be fruitful, and multiply, and replenish the earth, and subdue it; and have dominion over the fish of the sea, and over the fowl of the heavens, 
and over every living thing that creepeth upon the earth. As the most ancient people called the conjunction of the understanding and the will, or of faith and love, a marriage, everything of good produced 
from that marriage they called "fructifications" and everything of truth, "multiplications." Hence they are so called in the Prophets, as for instance in Ezekiel: </p>
<p>     I will multiply upon you 
man and beast, and they shall multiply and be fruitful, and I will cause you to dwell as in your ancient times, and will do better unto you than at your beginnings, and ye shall know that I am Jehovah, 
yea, I will cause man to walk upon you, even My people Israel (Ezek. 36:11-12).By "man" is here meant the spiritual man who is called Israel; by "ancient times" the Most Ancient Church; by "beginnings" 
the Ancient Church after the flood. The reason why "multiplication" which is of truth, is first mentioned, and "fructification" which is of good, afterwards, is that the passage treats of one who 
is to become regenerated, and not of one who is already regenerated.  [2] When the understanding is united with the will, or faith with love, the man is called by the Lord "a married land" as in Isaiah: </p>
<p> 
    Thy land shall be no more termed waste, but thou shalt be called Hephzibah [my delight is in her], and thy land Beulah [married], for Jehovah delighteth in thee, and thy land shall be married 
(Isa. 62:4). The fruits thence issuing, which are of truth, are called "sons" and those which are of good are called "daughters" and this very frequently in the Word.  [3] The earth is "replenished" 
or filled, when there are many truths and goods; for when the Lord blesses and speaks to man, that is, works upon him, there is an immense increase of good and truth, as the Lord says in Matthew: </p>
<p> 
    The kingdom of the heavens is like to a grain of mustard seed, which a man took and sowed in his field, which indeed is the least of all seeds, but when it is grown, it is the greatest among herbs, 
and becometh a tree, so that the birds of the heavens come and build their nests in the branches thereof (Matt. 13:31-32). A "grain of mustard seed" is man's good before he becomes spiritual, which 
is "the least of all seeds" because he thinks that he does good of himself, and what is of himself is nothing but evil. But as he is in a state of regeneration, there is something of good in him, but 
it is the least of all.  [4] At length as faith is joined with love it grows larger, and becomes an "herb;" and lastly, when the conjunction is completed, it becomes a "tree" and then the "birds of 
the heavens" (in this passage also denoting truths, or things intellectual) "build their nests in its branches" which are memory-knowledges. When man is spiritual, as well as during the time of his 
becoming spiritual, he is in a state of combat, and therefore it is said, "subdue the earth and have dominion." </p>

<p align="center"><b>Elliott(1983-1999) 55</b></p><p><b>55.</b>
Verse 28 And God blessed them, and God said to them, Be fruitful and multiply, and fill the earth and subdue it; and have dominion over the fish of the sea, and over the birds of the air,<A name="fntext1"></a><A href="#fn1"><sup>a</sup></a> and over every 
living thing that creeps upon the earth.  </p>
<p>Because the most ancient people applied the term Marriage to understanding and will, or faith and love, when joined together, they gave the name Fruitfulness 
to any good resulting from that marriage, and Multiplication to any truth. For this reason similar expressions occur in the Prophets, as in Ezekiel,  </p>
<blockquote>
I will multiply upon you man and beast, 
and they will multiply and be fruitful, and I will resettle you<A name="fntext2"></a><A href="#fn2"><sup>b</sup></a> to be as in your ancient times, and I will bless you more than in your former times, and you will know that I am Jehovah, and I will 
cause man to walk upon you, even My people Israel. <a href="http://bible.gospelcom.net/cgi-bin/bible?passage=Ezek%2036:8-11&amp;version=ESV&amp;interface=print&amp;showfn=yes&amp;showxref">Ezek 36:8-11</a>.  
</blockquote>
<p>Here 'man' is used to mean the spiritual man, who is also called Israel, 'ancient times' the Most Ancient Church, 'former times' the 
Ancient Church which came after the Flood. The reason why 'multiplying', which relates to truth, comes first and why 'being fruitful', which relates to good, follows is that the subject is the person 
who is to be regenerated, not one who has been regenerated.  </p>
<p></p>
<p><b>[2]</b>
 When the understanding is coupled to the will, or faith to love, the individual is called by the Lord in Isaiah 'a married land', </p>
<blockquote>
Your 
land will no more be called Desolate, but you will be named My-good-pleasure-is-in-her, and your land, Married; for Jehovah will take His pleasure in you, and your land will be married. <a href="http://bible.gospelcom.net/cgi-bin/bible?passage=Isa%2062:4&amp;version=ESV&amp;interface=print&amp;showfn=yes&amp;showxref">Isa 62:4</a>.   
</blockquote>
The resulting fruits which are matters of truth are called 'sons', and the fruits which are matters of good are called 'daughters'. This recurs very frequently in the Word. </p>
<p></p>
<p><b>[3]</b>
 The earth 
is 'being filled' when there are many goods and truths, for when the Lord is 'blessing' and 'saying' - that is, when He is at work - the increase of good and truth is limitless, as the Lord says, </p>
<blockquote>
The 
kingdom of heaven is like a grain of mustard seed which a man took and sowed in his field; it is indeed the smallest of all seeds, but when it has grown it is the greatest of all plants and becomes 
a tree, so that the birds of the air<A name="fntext3"></a><A href="#fn3"><sup>c</sup></a> come and nest in its branches. <a href="http://bible.gospelcom.net/cgi-bin/bible?passage=Matt%2013:31,%2032&amp;version=ESV&amp;interface=print&amp;showfn=yes&amp;showxref">Matt 13:31, 32</a>.   
</blockquote>
'A grain of mustard seed' is the good a person has before he becomes spiritual. It is 'the smallest of all 
seeds' because he imagines that he himself is the source of the good he does. In reality what he does of himself is nothing but evil, yet because he is in a state of being regenerated there is some element 
of good, though it is quite 'the smallest of all'. Later on when faith is being joined to love it grows larger and becomes 'a plant'. Once it has finally been joined to love it develops into a tree, 
and at that point 'the birds of the air,<A name="fntext3"></a><A href="#fn3"><sup>c</sup></a> which here are truths or intellectual concepts, 'nest in its branches', which are facts.   </p>
<p><b>[4]</b>
 A person is involved in conflict not only when becoming 
spiritual, but also when he is spiritual. Hence the statement, 'Subdue the earth, and have dominion over it'.

Vers. 28.  Et benedixit illis Deus, et dixit illis Deus, Fructificate et multiplicate vos, et implete terram, et subjugate eam; e dominamini in pisces maris, et in avem caelorum, et in omne vivum reptans 
super terra. Antiquissimi, quia conjunctionem intellectus e voluntatis, seu fidei et amoris, vocabant conjugium, quicquid boni ex conjugio illo producebatur, appellabant 'fructificationes,' et quicquid 
veri 'multiplicationes,' inde apud Prophetas similiter, ut apud Ezechielem, Multiplicabo super vos hominem et bestiam, et multiplicabunt et fructificabunt se, et habitare faciam vos juxta antiquitate 
vestras, et benefaciam prae principiis vestris, et cognoscetis quod Ego Jehovah, et ambulare faciam super vobis, hominem, populum Meum Israelem, xxxvi x8-12: </p>
<p>per 'hominem' hic intelligitur homo 
spiritualis, qui etiam Israel vocatur; per 'antiquitates' Ecclesia Antiquissima; per 'principia' Ecclesia Antiqua post diluvium; quod 'multiplicatio,' quae est veri, praecedat, et 'fructificatio,' 
quae est boni, sequatur, est quia de regenerando, non de regenerato, agitur. Cum intellectus voluntati copulatus est, seu fides amori, vocatur homo a Domino 'terra maritata,' per Esaiam, Non dicetur 
terrae tuae amplius vasta, sed tibi vocabitur {1} beneplacitum Meum in illa, et terrae tuae maritata, quia beneplacebit Jehovae in te, et terra tua maritabitur, lxii 4; </p>
<p>fructus inde qui sunt veri, vocantur 
'filii'; et fructus qui sunt boni 'filiae,' et hoc quam saepe in Verbo: 'impletur terra,' cum multa vera et bona; Domino enim benedicente et dicente, hoc est, operante, crescit bonum et verum 
in immensum, sicut Dominus dicit, Simile est regnum caelorum grano sinapis, quod accipiens homo seminavit in agro suo, quod minus quidem est omnium seminum, cum autem creverit, majus omnibus oleribus 
est, et fit arbor, ita ut veniant aves caeli, et nidulentur in ramis ejus, Matth. xiii 31, 32. 'Granum sinapis' est bonum hominis antequam spiritualis, quo 'minimum est omnium seminum,' quia putat a 
semet bonum facere; quod a semet, est nihil nisi malum; sed quia in statu regenerationis est, est aliquid boni, sed minimum omnium; tandem sicut fides conjungit amori, fit majus, et 'olus'; demum cum 
conjuncta est, fit 'arbor,' et tunc 'aves caelorum,' quae hic etiam sunt vera seu intellectualia, 'in ramis ejus,' qui sunt scientifica, 'nidulantur.' Quando homo spiritualis est, sicut dum fit spiritualis, 
in pugna est, quare dicitur 'subjugate terram, et dominamini.' @  1 S. here translates the Heb. Hephzibah and Beulah.$ </p>
