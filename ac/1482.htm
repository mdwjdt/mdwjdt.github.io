<h3 align="center" class="ired">属天的奥秘 第1482节</h3>
<h4 align="center"></h4><p><strong>1482.</strong>“法老的臣宰看见了她”表首要诫命，也就是“法老的臣宰”。在圣言中，无论历史部分还是预言部分，“臣宰”都表首要事物。“法老”和“埃及”的含义是一样的，埃及或法老在此取最好的意义，因为他们涉及主在孩童时所吸收的首要诫命。从这些臣宰的内义清楚可知，他们是圣言的首要诫命。一般来说，在圣言中，“法老”和“埃及”的含义是一样的，这可通过很多经文得以证实，如所提到的其他有名有姓的国王具有和他们王国名字一样的含义。不过，“臣宰”表他们的首要事物，如以赛亚书：<br />琐安的臣宰，法老大有智慧的谋士极其愚昧；你们怎敢对法老说，我是智慧人的子孙，我是古王的后裔？琐安的臣宰都变为愚昧，挪弗的臣宰都受了迷惑。（以赛亚书<a href="http://39-27.cn/赛19.11.htm">19:11</a>，<a href="http://39-27.cn/赛19.13.htm">13</a>）<br />此处“琐安的臣宰”和“法老大有智慧的谋士”都表首要知识；由于智慧首先在埃及繁荣发展，如前所述，故它被称为“智慧人的子孙”和“古王的后裔”。所以，在圣言中，“臣宰”通常表首要事物。</p><br />

<p><strong>[NCE]1482.</strong> Pharaoh's officers saw symbolizes the main commandments, which are Pharaoh's officers, as can be seen from the symbolism of officers and of Pharaoh. In the Word, in both the narrative and prophetic parts, officers, or chiefs, symbolize things that are most important. And Pharaoh symbolizes the same thing as Egypt. The present verse refers to Egypt or Pharaoh in the best sense because it uses both to portray the study of religious knowledge 钬?the first study that the Lord took up in his youth.<br />The fact that they were the main commandments from the Word can be seen from the symbolism of these things on an inner level.<br />Much evidence confirms that in the Word, Pharaoh symbolizes the same thing as the whole of Egypt, just as the monarchs of other kingdoms mentioned by name symbolize the same thing as the names of the kingdoms themselves.<br />Officers, though, symbolize the primary elements in those kingdoms. In Isaiah, for instance:<br />Stupid are the chieftains of Zoan, the sage advisors of Pharaoh. How can you say to Pharaoh, "I am the offspring of sages, the offspring of the monarchs of old"? The chieftains of Zoan have become fools; the chieftains of Noph{*1} have been deceived.

The princes of Pharaoh saw her. That this signifies the primary precepts, which are "the princes of Pharaoh," is evident from the signification of "princes," and of "Pharaoh." In both the historical 
and prophetical parts of the Word, "princes" signify the things which are primary; and "Pharaoh" signifies the same as "Egypt;" and here "Egypt," or "Pharaoh," is used in the best sense, because predicated 
of the memory-knowledge of knowledges which the Lord first acquired in childhood. That they were primary precepts from the Word, is evident from the signification of these things in the internal 
sense. That, speaking generally, by "Pharaoh" in the Word is signified the same as by "Egypt," may be confirmed from many passages; as also that by the kings of other kingdoms, who are named, the same 
is signified as by the names of the kingdoms; but by "princes" are signified their primary things, as in Isaiah: </p>
<p>     The princes of Zoan are foolish, the wise counselors of Pharaoh; how say ye unto 
Pharaoh, I am the son of the wise, the son of ancient kings? The princes of Zoan are become fools, the princes of Noph are deceived (Isa. 19:11, 13). Here "the princes of Zoan," and "the wise counselors 
of Pharaoh," denote the primary memory-knowledges; and as wisdom first flourished in Egypt, as before said, it is called "the son of the wise," and "the son of ancient kings." So "princes" frequently 
denote in the Word primary things. </p>

<p align="center"><b>Elliott(1983-1999) 1482</b></p><p><b>1482.</b>
That 'Pharaoh's princes saw' means the first and foremost commandments, which are 'pharaoh's princes', is clear from the meaning of 'princes' and of 'Pharaoh'. In the Word, in both its historical and 
its prophetical parts, princes mean the things that are first and foremost. 'pharaoh' has the same meaning as Egypt, Egypt or Pharaoh being used in the best sense here, since they refer to knowledge 
comprised of cognitions which the Lord took in first in childhood. That first and foremost commandments from the Word are meant is clear from the meaning of these princes in the internal sense. That in 
general 'Pharaoh' in the Word has the same meaning as Egypt may be confirmed from many references, even as the kings of other kingdoms who are mentioned by name have the same meaning as the actual names 
given to their kingdoms. But by 'the princes' are meant their first and foremost features, as in Isaiah, </p>
<blockquote>
The princes of Zoan are foolish, the wise counselors of Pharaoh. . How do you say to Pharaoh, 
I am a son of the wise, a son of the kings of old? The princes of Zoan have become fools, the princes of Noph deluded. <a href="http://bible.gospelcom.net/cgi-bin/bible?passage=Isa%2019:11,%2013&amp;version=ESV&amp;interface=print&amp;showfn=yes&amp;showxref">Isa 19:11, 13</a>. 
</blockquote>
<p>Here 'the princes of Zoan and the wise counselors of Pharaoh' 
stands for facts that are first and foremost. And since wisdom flourished initially in Egypt, as stated already, it is called 'a son of the wise, and a son of the kings of old'. And there are many 
other places in the Word where in the same way 'princes' stands for features that are first and foremost. </p>

'Viderunt principes Pharaonis': quod significet primaria praecepta, quae sunt 'principes Pharaonis,' constat ex significatione 'principum et Pharaonis'; principes in Verbo significant illa quae sunt 
primaria, tam in historicis quam in propheticis Verbi; et 'Pharao' significat idem ac Aegyptus, et hic Aegyptus seu Pharao in optimo sensu, quia praedicantur de scientia cognitionum quam Dominus in pueritia 
primum arripuit. Quod fuerint primaria praecepta ex Verbo, ex significatione horum in sensu interno constat.  Quod per 'Pharaonem' in Verbo significetur idem ac per Aegyptum in communi, multis 
confirmari potest, sicut etiam per reges aliorum regnorum nominatos idem ac per ipsa nomina regnorum: per 'principes' autem primaria illorum, ut apud Esaiam, 	Stulti principes Zoanis, sapientes consiliarii 
Pharaonis;... quomodo dicitis ad Pharaonem, Filius sapientum ego, filius regum antiquitatis,... infatuati principes Zoanis, decepti principes Noph, xix 11, 13; </p>
<p>ibi 'principes Zoanis, et sapientes 
consiliarii Pharaonis' pro primariis scientificis; et quia sapientia primitus viguit in Aegypto, ut prius dictum, vocatur 'filius sapientum, et filius regum antiquitatis': ita quoque alibi multoties 
in Verbo 'principes' pro primariis. </p>
