<h3 align="center" class="ired">属天的奥秘 第6666节</h3>
<h4 align="center"></h4><p><strong>6666.</strong>“埃及人使以色列人作工”表征服或掌控的意图或目的。这从“使他们作工”、“埃及人”和“以色列人”的含义清楚可知：“使他们作工”是指征服或掌控，在此是指征服或掌控的意图或目的，因为他们不断努力把别人征服，或置于自己的掌控之下，但永远不会胜过善人，在他们那里占上风；“埃及人”是指反对教会真理的分离的记忆知识（参看<a href="6651.htm">6651</a>节）；“以色列人”是指教会（<a href="6637.htm">6637</a>节）。由此明显可知，“埃及人使以色列人作工”表示那些赞成反对教会真理的分离的记忆知识之人将它们（即教会）征服或置于其掌控之下的意图或目的。<br />至于诸如存在于属地狱的恶人当中的征服或掌控的意图或目的，我还蒙允许知道它的性质。他们把那些接受良善与真理的人征服或置于其掌控之下的这种努力和意图或目的，其性质无法描述。因为他们会利用各种各样的恶意，各种各样的狡诈和欺骗，各种各样的诡计和各种各样的残忍；这些手段的程度和性质是这样：仅仅提及其中的一部分，世上几乎没有人能相信；他们所用的手段如此狡猾、巧妙，又如此地坏不堪言。总之，这些手段具有这样的性质：没有任何人，甚至没有任何天使能抵抗它们，唯有主能。他们之所以拥有这样一种努力和意图或目的，是因为他们生命的一切快乐，因而生命本身就在于行恶；因此，没有别的东西占据他们的心思，所以他们也没有别的打算。他们根本不可能做任何善事，因为他们讨论这种事，即便行善也是为了自我，因而只为他们自己而行。<br />如今，由这种人组成的地狱正在急剧增长；令人惊愕的是，这类人主要来自教会里的人，因为狡诈、欺骗、仇恨、报复和奸淫在那里比在别处更猖獗。事实上，在今天的教会，诡诈被视为聪明，奸淫被视为高尚行为；那些有不同看法的人遭到嘲笑。由于这就是当今教会的情形，所以这就是它的末日即将来临的预兆；按照主在马太福音（<a href="http://39-27.cn/太24.22.htm">24:22</a>）中的话说：“凡有血气的，总没有一个得救的”；因为一切邪恶都具有传染性，就像腐烂物污染整体，如此最终污染所有人。</p>

And the Egyptians made the sons of Israel to serve. That this signifies an intention to subjugate, is evident from the signification of "making to serve," as being subjugation, here the intention to 
subjugate, because they are in the continual endeavor to subjugate, but in no wise prevail against the good; from the signification of the "Egyptians," as being separated memory-knowledges which are opposed 
to the truths of the church (see n. 6651); and from the signification of the "sons of Israel," as being the church (n. 6637). Hence it is evident that by "the Egyptians made the sons of Israel 
to serve" is signified the intention to subjugate by those who are in separated memory-knowledges which are opposed to the truths of the church. [2] As regards the intention to subjugate, such as exists 
with the evil who are from hell, I have also been given to know this. Such is their endeavor and intention to subjugate those who are in good and truth that it cannot be described; for they make use 
of all malice, all cunning and fraud, all deceit, and all cruelty, so great and of such a nature that if these were told in part only, hardly anyone in the world could believe it; so cunning and artful 
are their devices, and so execrable. In a word, these infernals are of such a nature that they cannot possibly be resisted by any man, nor even by any angel, but by the Lord alone. The reason why 
they are possessed with such an endeavor and intention is that all their delight of life, thus their life itself, consists in doing evil; and therefore nothing else occupies their thoughts, consequently 
they intend nothing else. They are quite unable to do what is good, because this is repugnant to them: if they do what is good, it is for the sake of self, thus is done to self. [3] From such spirits 
the hells are at this day immensely increased, and wonderful to say, especially from those who are within the church, on account of the cunning, deceit, hatred, revenge, and adultery, which flourish 
there more than elsewhere; for within the church cunning is now esteemed ingenious, and adultery honorable, and they who deem otherwise are laughed at. Its being so within the church at this day is 
a sign that its last time is at hand, for "Except there be an end, no flesh would be saved," according to the Lord's words in Matt. 24:22; because all evil is contagious, and infects, as lees do the 
lump, thus at last all. </p>

'And the Egyptians made the children of Israel serve' means the aim to bring them under their control. This is clear from the meaning of 'making them serve' as bringing under their control, here the 
aim to do so because although they endeavour constantly to bring others under their control they never get the upper hand over those who are good; from the meaning of 'the Egyptians' as separated factual 
knowledge that is opposed to the Church's truths, dealt with in <a href="6651.htm">6651</a>; and from the meaning of 'the children of Israel' as the Church, dealt with in <a href="6637.htm">6637</a>. From these meanings it is evident that 'the 
Egyptians made the children of Israel serve' means the aim held by those who favour separated factual knowledge opposed to the Church's truths, to bring them [the Church] under their control. </p>
<p></p>
<p><b>[2]</b>
As regards the aim to bring others under one's own control, I have also been allowed to know what that aim is like among the evil belonging to hell. The nature of their endeavour and aim to bring under 
their control those who accept what is good and true defies description. For they employ every kind of malice, every kind of guile and deceit, every kind of trickery, and every kind of cruelty, the 
extent and nature of which are such that if merely a part were mentioned scarcely anyone in the world could believe it, so full of guile and artfulness are the methods they use, and so unspeakable too. 
In short those methods are such that no one at all, not even any angel, only the Lord, can stand up to them. The reason why such an endeavour and aim is present in them is that the whole delight of 
their life, thus their very life, consists in the doing of evil, on account of which nothing else occupies their minds, and consequently nothing else is intended by them. They cannot do anything good 
at all because it repels them; or if they do do anything good, it is for selfish reasons, thus only for themselves. </p>
<p></p>
<p><b>[3]</b>
 Hells made up of people like this are growing immensely larger at the present 
day; and what is astounding, such people come mainly from among those within the Church on account of all the guile, trickery, hatred, revenge, and adultery that flourish there more than anywhere else. 
For in the Church of today guile is reckoned to be cleverness, and adultery to be honourable behaviour; and those who think anything different are laughed at. Since this is the situation at the present 
day within the Church, it is a sign that its last days are at hand, for according to the Lord's words recorded in <a href="http://bible.gospelcom.net/cgi-bin/bible?passage=Matthew%2024:22&amp;version=ESV&amp;interface=print&amp;showfn=yes&amp;showxref">Matthew 24:22</a>, unless it came to an end 'no flesh would be saved'. Indeed all evil 
is infectious and like rottenness contaminates the whole, thus everyone in the end. </p>

`Et servire fecerunt Aegyptii filios Israelis': quod significet subjugationis intentionem, constat ex significatione `servire facere' quod sit subjugatio, hic subjugationis intentio quia in continuo 
conatu subjugandi sunt, sed nusquam contra bonos praevalent; ex significatione `Aegyptiorum' quod sint scientifica separata quae contra vera Ecclesiae, de qua n. 6651; et a significatione `filiorum Israelis' 
quod sint Ecclesia, de qua n. 6637; exinde patet quod per `servire fecerunt Aegyptii filios Israelis' significetur subjugationis intentio ab illis qui sunt in scientificis separatis quae contra 
vera Ecclesiae. 	2 Quod subjugationis intentionem attinet, qualis sit apud malos qui ab inferno, etiam {1} scire datum est; talis est illis conatus et intentio {2} subjugandi (c)eos qui in bono et 
vero sunt, ut non describi queat; utuntur enim omni malitia, omni astu et fraude, omni dolo, (c)et omni crudelitate, quae tanta et talia sunt ut si modo quoad aliquam partem memorarentur, vix: aliquis 
in mundo potuisset credere, tam astuosa et artificiosa sunt, et quoque tam nefanda; verbo talia sunt ut {3}nequaquam ab ullo homine, ne quidem ab ullo angelo, resisti queant, sed a solo Domino; causa 
quod talis illis conatus et intentio sit, est quia omne jucundum vitae, ita ipsa vita eorum, in male faciendo consistit; quapropter nihil aliud cogitationes eorum occupat, consequenter nihil aliud {4}intendunt; 
bonum facere prorsus non possunt quia repugnat; si bonum faciunt, est propter se, ita sibi. 	3 Ex talibus (s)inferna (t)hodie augentur immensum, et quod mirum, imprimis ab illis qui intra 
Ecclesiam sunt, ob astus, dolos, odia, vindictas, {5} adulteria, quae ibi vigent plus quam alibi, nam ibi nunc astus pro ingenioso, et adulteria pro honesto habentur, ac {6}ridentur qui aliter sentiunt; 
quia ita hodie est intra Ecclesiam, indicium e quod ultimum ejus tempus instet, nam `nisi finis, nulla caro salvaretur,' secundum Domini verba apud Matthaeum xxiv 22; quippe omne malum contagiosum 
est, (c)ac infectat sicut faex massam, ita tandem omnes.(s) 	@1 i ab experientia$ 	@2 i infernorum$ 	@3 ne hilum$ 	@4 intendere possunt$ 	@5 i et$ 	@6 d ridentur i irridentur$ </p>
