<h3 align="center" class="ired">属天的奥秘 第9543节</h3>
<h4 align="center"></h4><p><strong>9543.</strong>“桌子要用杠来抬”表由此而牢固保持存在。这从“抬”和“桌子”的含义清楚可知：“抬”是指存在和持续存在（参看<a href="9540.htm">9540</a>节），因而也指牢固保持存在；“桌子”是指天上赐福或事物的容器（<a href="9527.htm">9527</a>节）。这一切都是用来描述至内层或第三层天堂如何从主接受良善的；因为“陈设饼”是指来自主的天上良善；摆有这些饼的“桌子”是指这良善的容器。不过，我未被允许详细描述每一个真实的细节，因为在主的属天国度，大多数事物超越人类的思维范畴，几乎超越住在最低层天堂的天使灵的思维范畴。事实上，在主的属天国度，一切事物都建立在属于爱的良善基础上，而不是建立在属于信的真理基础上。此外，那里的人通过爱之良善彼此交流，而不像主的属灵国度里的人那样通过信之真理交流（参看<a href="9277.htm">9277</a>节提到的地方）。<br />主的属天国度是至内层或第三层天堂，存在于这层天堂里面的事物是不可理解、无法描述的，也就是说，这些事物从未进入任何人的脑海，是眼睛未曾看见，耳朵未曾听见的，如众所周知的。因此，存在于该天堂中的事物通过代表它们的物体而呈现在下面的灵人眼前，他们通过这些代表能对存在于那里的不可理解、无法描述的事物形成某种概念。这些事物在世上由柜子、施恩座、基路伯、摆放陈设饼的桌子和灯台来代表；这些物体从视觉上呈现出属天国度里的一切事物。帐幕的居所和院子，以及那里的帘子和幔子，以同样的方式用来代表存在于主的属灵国度，也就是第二层或中间天堂里的事物。</p>

And the table shall be carried with them. That this signifies the consequent endurance, is evident from the signification of "to be carried," as being to come forth and subsist (see n. 9540), thus also 
endurance; and from the signification of "the table," as being a receptacle of celestial things (n. 9527). Thus is described the inmost or third heaven in respect to the reception of good from the 
Lord. For "the breads of faces" denote the celestial good that is from the Lord; and "the table" on which these breads were, denotes the receptacle of this good. But it is not allowable to set forth every 
detail as it really is, because very many things in the celestial kingdom of the Lord do not fall into any idea of human thought, and scarcely into the idea of the thought of the angelic spirits 
who are in the ultimate heaven. For all things in the Lord's celestial kingdom are founded upon the good which is of love, and not on the truth which is of faith. Moreover, they speak together by means 
of the goods which are of love, and not by means of the truths which are of faith, as do those who are in the Lord's spiritual kingdom (see what is cited in n. 9277). [2] The Lord's celestial kingdom 
is the inmost or third heaven, in which as is known are things incomprehensible and unutterable, that is to say which have never entered into the mind of anyone, and eye hath not seen, nor ear heard. 
And therefore the things that come forth in this heaven are presented to view before the spirits below by means of representatives, from which some idea may be formed of the incomprehensible and unutterable 
things which are there. The same were represented in the world by the ark, the propitiatory [mercy seat], the cherubs, the table on which were the breads of faces, and by the lampstand. By means 
of these are presented all things in that kingdom; and by means of the Habitation and the court of the tent, and by means of the curtains and veils therein, were represented the things in the Lord's 
spiritual kingdom, which is the second or middle heaven. </p>

'And the table shall be carried with them' means being thereby held firmly in being. This is clear from the meaning of 'being carried' as being brought into being and kept in being, dealt with above 
in <a href="9540.htm">9540</a>, thus also being held firmly in being; and from the meaning of 'the table' as the receptacle of heavenly blessings, dealt with in <a href="9527.htm">9527</a>. All this serves to describe the manner in which the inmost 
or third heaven receives good from the Lord; for the loaves of the Presence are heavenly good that comes from the Lord, and the table on which the loaves were laid is the receptacle of that good. But 
I am not allowed to present a detailed description of the nature of this reality, because the majority of the things that exist in the Lord's celestial kingdom lie beyond the range of human thought 
and almost beyond that of the angelic spirits who live in the lowest heaven. For everything in the Lord's celestial kingdom is founded on the good that belongs to love, and not on the truth that belongs 
to faith. The fact that those there also communicate with one another through forms of the good of love, and not through the truths of faith as those in the Lord's spiritual kingdom do, see the places 
referred to in <a href="9277.htm">9277</a>.  </p>

<p><b>[2]</b>
 The Lord's celestial kingdom is the inmost or third heaven, and within it there exist realities beyond comprehension or description, that is, things which have never 
entered anyone's mind, and which eye has not seen and ear has not heard, as everyone knows. For this reason those realities existing in that heaven are brought before the eyes of spirits below by means 
of objects that represent them, and from these representatives they form some idea of the incomprehensible and indescribable realities that exist there. The same realities were represented in the world 
by the ark, mercy-seat, cherubs, table on which the loaves of the Presence were laid, and the lampstand; and these objects serve to present visually all the realities in that kingdom. In like manner 
the dwelling-place and court of the tent, also the curtains and veils there, served to represent the realities existing in the Lord's spiritual kingdom, which is the second or middle heaven.  </p>

`Et portabitur illis mensa': quod significet inde consistentia, constat ex significatione `portari' quod sit existere et subsistere, de qua supra n. 9540, ita quoque consistere, et ex significatione 
`mensae' quod sit receptaculum caelestium, de qua n. 9527. Ita describitur caelum intimum seu tertium quoad receptionem boni a Domino, panes enim facierum sunt bonum caeleste quod a Domino, et mensa 
super qua illi panes, est receptaculum illis boni. Sed singula secundum rei existentiam exponere, non licet, quoniam perplurima quae sunt in caelesti regno Domini non cadunt in ideam cogitationis humanae, 
et vix in ideam cogitationis spirituum angelicorum qui in ultimo caelo; fundantur enim omnia quae in caelesti regno Domini, super bono quod amoris et non super vero quod fidei; per bona quae amoris 
etiam inter se loquuntur, et non per vera quae fidei sicut illi in spirituali Domini regno sunt, videantur citata n. 9277. 	Regnum caeleste Domini est intimum seu tertium caelum, in 2 quo quod sint 
incomprehensibilia et ineffabilia, seu quae nusquam in alicujus mentem venerunt, et nusquam oculus vidit et auris audivit, notum est; quapropter (c)ea quae in (c)illo caelo existunt, coram spiritibus 
infra sistuntur per repraesentativa, ex quibus aliqua idea formatur de incomprehensibilibus et ineffabilibus quae ibi; eadem repraesentata sunt in mundo per arcam, propitiatorium, cherubos, mensam super 
qua panes facierum, et per candelabrum;{1} per illa {2}sistuntur omnia quae in eo regno {3}et per habitaculum et atrium tentorii, {4}perque aulaea et vela {5}ibi, repraesentata sunt quae in (t)regno
