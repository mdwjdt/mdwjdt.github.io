<h3 align="center" class="ired">属天的奥秘 第4262节</h3>
<h4 align="center"></h4><p><strong>4262.</strong>“就从那进他手的东西取了礼物，要送给他哥哥以扫”表要被引入属天-属世良善的神性事物。这从“从那进他手的东西取”和“礼物”的含义，以及“以扫”的代表清楚可知：“从那进他手的东西取”是指从那些事先想到并提供的事物，因而是指由圣治所提供的事物，因为归于圣治的事物就是神性，“从那进他手的东西取”在此表示来自神性的事物；“礼物”是指引入，如下文所述；“以扫”是指神性属世层的良善（参看<a href="3302.htm">3302</a>，<a href="3322.htm">3322</a>，<a href="3504.htm">3504</a>，<a href="3599.htm">3599</a>节），在这种情况下，该良善是属天良善，因为属世层尚未变成神性。<br />“礼物”之所以表示引入，是因为给予礼物体现了善意和厚待。事实上，在古时，所给予和献上的礼物具有各种含义；百姓进见国王和祭司时所献的礼物具有一种含义，献在祭坛上的礼物又具有另一种含义。前者表示引见，后者表示敬拜（<a href="349.htm">349</a>节）。因为总体上一切祭物，无论哪一种，都被称为“礼物”；而素祭，也就是饼和酒，或饼与奠酒，就专称为“礼物”；因为在原文，“素祭”表示“礼物”。<br />百姓进见国王和祭司时要向献上礼物，这一事实从圣言的许多经文清楚看出来。如扫罗去见撒母耳时就送上礼物（撒母耳记上<a href="http://39-27.cn/撒上9.7.htm">9:7</a>-<a href="http://39-27.cn/撒上9.8.htm">8</a>）；而藐视扫罗的人则没有送他礼物（撒母耳记上<a href="http://39-27.cn/撒上10.27.htm">10:27</a>）；示巴女王来见所罗门时也带来礼物（列王记上<a href="http://39-27.cn/王上10.2.htm">10:2</a>），其他人也一样，经上论到他们说：<br />全地上的人都求见所罗门一面，要听他的智慧；他们各人都带来自己的贡物，就是银器、金器、衣裳、军械、香料、马和骡等。（列王记上<a href="http://39-27.cn/王上10.24.htm">10:24</a>-<a href="http://39-27.cn/王上10.25.htm">25</a>）<br />由于这是一个习俗和神圣仪式，表示引见，所以耶稣刚一出生，东方智者便来拜祂，带来黄金、乳香和没药等礼物（马太福音<a href="http://39-27.cn/太2.11.htm">2:11</a>）；“黄金”表示属天之爱，“乳香”表示属灵之爱，“没药”表示存在于属世层里面的这些爱。<br />这种仪式是经上所吩咐的，这一点明显可见于摩西五经：<br />不可空手朝见耶和华的面。（出埃及记<a href="http://39-27.cn/出23.15.htm">23:15</a>；申命记<a href="http://39-27.cn/申16.16.htm">16:16</a>-<a href="http://39-27.cn/申16.17.htm">17</a>）<br />把礼物献给祭司或国王，就如同献给耶和华；这一点从圣言的其它地方可以看出来。至于所送上的礼物表示引见，这从以色列的十二位首领或族长在祭坛被膏后奉献在坛上的礼物（民数记7章）明显看出来。他们的礼物被称为“为行奉献坛之礼所献的”（民数记<a href="http://39-27.cn/民7.88.htm">7:88</a>）。</p>

And he took of that which came into his hand a present for Esau his brother. That this signifies things Divine to be initiated into celestial natural good, is evident from the signification of "taking 
of that which came into his hand," as being from those things which befell from forethought, and thus those which were from Divine Providence; and as those things which are of the Divine Providence 
are Divine, by "taking of that which came into his hand" are here signified things Divine;-from the signification of a "present," as being initiation (of which in what follows); and from the representation 
of Esau, as being the Divine natural as to good (see n. 3302, 3322, 3504, 3599), here as to celestial good, because the natural was not yet made Divine. [2] That a "present" signifies initiation, 
is because it was given to gain good will and favor; for in old time the presents which were given and offered had various significations; those which were given on approaching kings and priests signified 
one thing, and those which were offered upon the altar, another; the former signified initiation, but the latter, worship (n. 349). For all sacrifices in general, of whatever kind, were called 
"presents;" but the meat offerings which were bread and wine, or cakes with a libation, were specifically so called; for in the original language "meat offering" signifies a "present."  [3] That they 
gave presents to kings and priests on approaching them, is evident from many passages in the Word, as when Saul consulted Samuel (1 Sam. 9:7-8); when they who despised Saul did not offer him a present 
(1 Sam. 10:27); when the queen of Sheba came to Solomon (1 Kings 10:2); and also all the others of whom it is said: </p>
<p>       All the earth sought the faces of Solomon, to hear his wisdom; and they offered 
every man his present, vessels of silver, and vessels of gold, and garments, and arms, and spices, horses, and mules (1 Kings 10:24-25). And as this was a holy ritual, signifying initiation, the 
wise men from the east also, who came to Jesus just after His birth, brought presents-gold, frankincense, and myrrh (Matt. 2:11); "gold" signified celestial love; "frankincense," spiritual love; and 
"myrrh," these loves in the natural.  [4] That this ritual was commanded, is evident in Moses: </p>
<p>     The faces of Jehovah shall not be seen empty (Exod. 23:15; Deut. 16:16-17); </p>
<p>and that the presents 
given to priests and kings were as if given to Jehovah, is evident from other places in the Word. That presents which were sent signified initiation, is manifest from the presents which the twelve 
princes of Israel sent to initiate the altar, after it was anointed (Num. 7); where their presents are called "the initiation" (Num. 7:88). </p>

'And took from what came into his hand a gift for Esau his brother' means Divine things that were to be introduced into celestial-natural good. This is clear from the meaning of 'taking from what came 
into his hand' as from what had been provided and supplied and so what had been supplied by Divine Providence - and since the things attributable to Divine Providence are Divine, 'taking from what came 
into his hand' here means things that are Divine; from the meaning of 'a gift' as introduction, dealt with below; and from the representation of 'Esau' as the good of the Divine Natural, dealt with 
in <a href="3302.htm">3302</a>, <a href="3322.htm">3322</a>, <a href="3504.htm">3504</a>, <a href="3599.htm">3599</a>, which in this case is celestial good, because the Natural had not yet been made Divine </p>
<p></p>
<p><b>[2]</b>
 The reason 'a gift' means introduction is that it was made to initiate goodwill 
and favour. Indeed in former times the gifts which were made and offered had differing meanings, the gifts presented by people to kings or priests when they went to them having one meaning, those offered 
on the altar another. The former meant introduction but the latter meant worship, <a href="349.htm">349</a>, for all sacrifices in general of every kind were called 'gifts' while the minchahs, which were offerings of 
bread and wine, that is, of cakes accompanied by a libation, were specifically called such; for in the original language 'minchah' means a gift. </p>
<p></p>
<p><b>[3]</b>
 The fact that gifts were presented to kings or 
priests when people went to them is clear from many places in the Word. Saul did so when he went to consult Samuel, <a href="http://bible.gospelcom.net/cgi-bin/bible?passage=1%20Sam%209:7,%208&amp;version=ESV&amp;interface=print&amp;showfn=yes&amp;showxref">1 Sam 9:7, 8</a>, whereas the men who despised Saul did not bring him any gift, <a href="http://bible.gospelcom.net/cgi-bin/bible?passage=1%20Sam%2010:27&amp;version=ESV&amp;interface=print&amp;showfn=yes&amp;showxref">1 Sam 10:27</a>. And the Queen of Sheba brought a gift when she came to Solomon, <a href="1.htm">1</a> Kings 10:2, like everyone else, of whom the following is said, </p>
<p>The whole earth sought Solomon's presence to hear his wisdom; 
and every one brought his gift, vessels of silver and vessels of gold, and garments and armour, and spices, horses and mules. <a href="1.htm">1</a> Kings 10:24, <a href="25.htm">25</a>. </p>
<p>And as this was a customary and holy practice, meaning 
introduction, the wise men from the east who came to Jesus soon after His birth brought gifts of gold, frankincense, and myrrh, Matt. 2:11. 'Gold' meant celestial love, 'frankincense' spiritual love, 
and 'myrrh' those loves as they exist within the natural. </p>
<p></p>
<p><b>[4]</b>
 Indeed this customary practice was commanded, as is clear in Moses, Jehovah's face shall not be seen by the empty-handed. Exod. 23:15; 
Deut. 16:16, <a href="17.htm">17</a>. </p>
<p>Also, when gifts were presented to priests or kings it was as though they were presented to Jehovah, as may be seen from other places in the Word. As regards gifts that were sent 
meaning introduction, this is evident from the gifts which the twelve princes of Israel sent when the altar was introduced or dedicated after it had been anointed, Num. 7:1-end. In verse 88 of that 
chapter their gifts are actually called 'the dedication (or introduction) offering'. </p>

`Et accepit de veniente in manum suam munus Esavo fratri suo': quod significet Divina initianda bono caelesti naturali, constat ex significatione `accipere de veniente in manum' quod sit ex illis 
quae proviso obtigerunt, ita quae ex Divina providentia, et quia illa quae Divinae providentiae sunt, Divina sunt, ideo hic per `accipere de veniente in manum suam' significantur Divina; ex significatione 
`muneris' quod sit initiatio, de qua sequitur; et ex repraesentatione `Esavi' quod sit Divinum Naturale quoad bonum, de qua n. 3302, 3322, 3504, 3599, hic quoad bonum caeleste, quia Naturale 
nondum Divinum factum.  [2] Quod `munus' significet initiationem, est quia erat ad captandam benevolentiam et gratiam; </p>
<p>munera enim quae dabantur et offerebantur olim varia significabant aliud quae 
dabant regibus et sacerdotibus cum illos adirent, (o)et aliud quae offerebant super altari; illa significabant initiationem haec autem cultum, n. 349, omnia erum sacrificia `in communi' cujuscumque 
generis dicebantur munera, at minhae quae erant panis et vinum, seu placentae cum libamine, in specie, nam `minha' in lingua originali significat munus.  [3] Quod munera darent regibus et sacerdotibus 
cum illos adirent, constat ex pluribus locis in Verbo, ut cum Saul consuleret Samuelem, 1 Sam ix 7, 8: quod illi qui contempserunt Saulem, non {2} offerrent ei munus, 1 Sam. x 27: </p>
<p>cum regina 
Shebae ad Salomonem veniret, i Reg. x 2; et quoque reliqui, de quibus haec,           Omnis terra quaerebat facies Salomonis ad audiendum      sapientiam illius... et illi offerentes quisque munus 
suum,      vasa argenti et vasa auri, et vestes et arma, et aromata,      equos et mulos, 1 Reg. x 24, 25; </p>
<p>et quia id rituale sanctum fuit, significans initiationem, etiam           Sapientes ab 
oriente, qui venerunt ad Jesum recens      natum, attulerunt munera, aurum, tus, et myrrham, Matth. ii      11; </p>
<p>`aurum' significabat amorem caelestem, `tus' amorem spiritualem, `myrrha' illos amores 
in naturali.  [4] Quod rituale illud mandatum fuerit, constat apud Mosen,           Facies Jehovae non videbuntur vacuae {3}, Exod.      (x)xxiii 15; Deut. xvi 16, 17; </p>
<p>et quod munera quae data 
erant sacerdotibus et regibus, essent sicut Jehovae, constare potest ab aliis locis in Verbo. Quod munera quae mittebantur, significarent initiationem, patet a muneribus quae duodecim principes Israelis 
mittebant ad initiandum altare postquam unctum erat, Num. vii 1 ad fin.; ubi munera illorum vocantur initiatio, ibid. vers. 88.      @1 after generis$      @2 i tunc regem$      @3 In 9293 
S has vacue; the Hebrew word is an adverb.$ </p>
