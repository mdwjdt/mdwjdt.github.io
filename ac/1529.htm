<h4 align="center"></h4><p><strong>1529.</strong>来自那里，即来自主的光如此之大，这在天堂是众所周知的，但在灵人界却不那么清楚。值得注意的是，主向第三层天的属天天使显为一轮太阳，向属灵天使则显为一轮月亮。光的本源只此一个。不过，天使所拥有的光的强度取决于他们所具有的属天、属灵之物，而这光的性质则取决于这些事物的性质。因此，主的属天、属灵之物会凭借这光而显现在他们的外在视觉面前。</p><br />

<p><strong>[NCE]1529.</strong> People know perfectly well in heaven 钬?though not as well in the world of spirits 钬?where such great light comes from: the Lord. Remarkably, in the third heaven the Lord appears to heavenly angels as a sun and to spiritual angels as a moon. There is no other source for their light. But the amount of light they enjoy depends on the amount of heavenliness and spirituality they have; and the type of light they enjoy depends on the type of heavenliness and spirituality. Consequently, the genuinely heavenly and spiritual quality of the Lord presents itself to the angels' outward sight in the form of light. </p>
<p align="center"><b>Potts(1905-1910) 1529</b></p><p><b>1529.</b>
It is perfectly well known in heaven, but not so well in the world of spirits, whence comes the light that is so great, namely, from the Lord; and it is a remarkable fact that the Lord appears in the 
third heaven to the celestial angels as a Sun, and to the spiritual angels as a Moon. The very origin of the light is this and this alone. But the angels have light in proportion to what is celestial 
and spiritual with them, and the quality of this determines the quality of their light. Thus the Lord's celestial and spiritual manifests itself before their external sight by means of light. </p>

<p align="center"><b>Elliott(1983-1999) 1529</b></p><p><b>1529.</b>
It is very well known in heaven, but not so well known in the world of spirits, where so great a light comes from, namely from the Lord And what is astonishing, the Lord appears to celestial angels in 
the third heaven as the Sun, but to spiritual angels as the Moon. There is no other source of light. But the intensity of the light angels experience depends on how celestial and spiritual they are, 
and the nature of the light depends on the nature of these qualities Thus the Lord's celestial and spiritual itself shows itself before angers' external vision by means of the light. </p>

</p><b>1529.</b>
In caelo notissimum est, non ita in mundo spirituum, unde lux tanta, quod nempe a Domino; et quod mirum, Dominus apparet in caelo tertio angelis caelestibus ut Sol, et angelis spiritualibus ut Luna; 
ipsa origo lucis non est aliunde; at quantum caeleste et spirituale apud angelos, tantum lucis habent, et quale caeleste et spirituale, talem lucem; ita ipsum caeleste et spirituale Domini se manifestat 
per lucem coram visu eorum externo. </p>
