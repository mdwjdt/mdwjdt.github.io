<h3 align="center" class="ired">属天的奥秘 第9683节</h3>
<h4 align="center"></h4><p><strong>9683.</strong>“把桌子安在帷帐外”表经由属于爱的天上事物或赐福而来的流注。这从“桌子”和“帷帐外”的含义清楚可知：摆放陈设饼或脸饼的“桌子”是指天上事物或赐福的容器（<a href="9527.htm">9527</a>，<a href="9545.htm">9545</a>节）；“帷帐外”是指联结媒介之外，间接流注经由这媒介而来，“帷帐”表示联结的媒介（<a href="9670.htm">9670</a>节）。由于这张桌子被直接放在帷帐的后面，故所表示的是经由属于至内层天堂的天上事物或赐福，也就是爱之良善而来的流注。该流注既直接来自主，也经由至内层天堂间接来自主（可参看<a href="9682.htm">9682</a>e节所提到的地方）。至于构成与人和天使同在的天堂生命，因而构成永生的一切良善，情况是这样：良善至内在的核心是主自己，因而是直接从祂发出的爱之良善，接下来是相爱的良善，之后是对邻之仁的良善，最后是信之良善。这就是良善从至内在的核心开始的相继次序。由此可见直接和间接的流注是怎么回事。总的来说，在其它层级之下的良善层级，也就是更外在的良善，在含有更内在的良善在自己里面的程度内而为良善，因为它在同等程度上接近主，而主是至内在的良善，如前所述。不过，排列并有序整理良善（更外在良善里面的更内在良善）的后续层级的方式却照着对良善的接受而因人而异，接受则取决于每个人在世上的属灵和道德生活，因为每个人在世上所过的生活都会永远伴随着他。<br />主也直接流入每一个人，因为没有这种直接流注，间接流注就一事无成。直接流注照着人或天使所在的秩序，因而照着从神性发出的神性真理而被接受，因为这真理就是秩序（<a href="1728.htm">1728</a>，<a href="1919.htm">1919</a>，<a href="2447.htm">2447</a>，<a href="4839.htm">4839</a>，<a href="5703.htm">5703</a>，<a href="7995.htm">7995</a>，<a href="8512.htm">8512</a>，<a href="8513.htm">8513</a>，<a href="8700.htm">8700</a>，<a href="8988.htm">8988</a>节）。因此，对一个人来说，秩序就是生活在来自主的良善中，也就是说，靠主生活，或说从主生活。这种流注持续不断；它进入一个人意愿的每一个萌动中，并尽可能地把它转向真正的秩序，因为人自己的意愿不断把他引离真正的秩序。人的本意和非本意的能力也是这种情况。他的本意能力不断将他引离秩序，但他的非本意能力却不断将他带回秩序。由于这个原因，非本意的心脏运动与人有意识的意愿完全分离，他的小脑活动也是这样；心脏运动和小脑的力量掌控意愿的能力，防止它们超过一定限度，过早地耗尽身体的生命。所以这两种能力（即非本意的能力和本意的能力）的主要活动在整个身体中联合起来进行。提及这些事是为了在某种程度上阐明关于来自主的爱之属天事物或赐福和信之属灵事物或赐福的直接和间接流注的观念。</p>

And thou shalt put the table outside the veil. That this signifies influx through the celestial things that belong to love, is evident from the signification of "the table on which were the breads of 
faces," as being the receptacle of celestial things (n. 9527, 9545); and from the signification of "outside the veil," as being outside the uniting intermediate through which there is mediate influx; 
for by "the veil" is signified the uniting intermediate (n. 9670), and because that table was behind the veil, therefore there was signified influx through the celestial things of the inmost heaven, 
which are the goods of love. That there is mediate influx from the Lord through the inmost heaven, and immediate influx from Himself, can be seen from the places above cited (n. 9682e). With every good 
which makes heavenly life, thus eternal life, with man and with angel, the case is this. The inmost of good is the Lord Himself, consequently is the good of love which is immediately from Him; the good 
which next succeeds is the good of mutual love; then the good of charity toward the neighbor; finally the good of faith. This is the successive order of goods from the inmost. From this it can be 
seen how the case is with immediate and mediate influx. In general it may be said that insofar as a good succeeding in order (that is, a more external good), has in it a more interior good, so far it 
is good, for insofar it is nearer to the Lord Himself, who, as before said, is the inmost good. But the successive arrangement and setting in order of interior goods in exterior, varies in each and all 
subjects according to the reception, and the reception is according to the spiritual and moral life in the world of everyone, for the life in the world remains with everyone to eternity. [2] The influx 
of the Lord is also immediate with everyone, for without immediate influx the mediate effects nothing. Immediate influx is received according to the order in which the man or angel is, thus according 
to the Divine truth which is from the Divine, because this is order (n. 1728, 1919, 2447, 4839, 5703, 7995, 8512, 8513, 8700, 8988); and so it is order itself with man that he should live in the 
good which is from the Lord, that is, that he should live from the Lord. This influx is continual, and is adjoined to each and all things of the will of man, directing them as much as possible into order, 
for man's own will is continually leading him away from order. It is the same with the voluntary and involuntary things in man. His voluntary things continually lead away from order, but the involuntary 
ones continually bring back to order. It is for this reason that the motion of the heart, which is involuntary, is completely removed from man's will, and in like manner the action of the cerebellum; 
and that the motions of the heart, and the powers of the cerebellum, direct the voluntary things, to prevent them from rushing beyond bounds and extinguishing the life of the body before its time; 
and therefore the primal activities of both the involuntary and the voluntary things in the whole body go on conjointly. These things have been said in order in some measure to illustrate the idea 
about the immediate and the mediate influx of the celestial things of love and the spiritual things of faith from the Lord. </p>

<p align="center"><b>Elliott(1983-1999) 9683</b></p><p><b>9683.</b>
'And you shall place the table outside the veil' means influx through heavenly blessings belonging to love. This is clear from the meaning of 'the table', on which the loaves of the Presence were laid, 
as the receptacle of heavenly blessings, dealt with in <a href="9527.htm">9527</a>, <a href="9545.htm">9545</a>; and from the meaning of 'outside the veil' as outside the uniting intermediary through which indirect influx comes, for 'the veil' 
means a uniting intermediary, <a href="9670.htm">9670</a>. And since this table was placed immediately behind the veil an influx through heavenly blessings belonging to the inmost heaven, which are forms of the good of love, 
is meant. The fact that this influx comes both indirectly from the Lord through the inmost heaven, and directly from Him, may be seen from the places referred to above at the end of <a href="9682.htm">9682</a>. The situation 
with all the good which constitutes heavenly life and so eternal life with man and with angel is that the inmost core of good is the Lord Himself and consequently the good of love which emanates 
directly from Him. The next in order is the good of mutual love, after this the good of charity towards the neighbour, and finally the good of faith. This is the order in which forms of good beginning 
with the inmost core succeed one another. From this it may be seen what the situation is with direct and indirect influx. In general a degree of good below other degrees, that is, good which is more 
external, is good in the measure that it holds more internal good within itself, for in the same measure is its closeness to the Lord Himself, who is the inmost good, as has been stated. But the ways 
in which succeeding degrees of good - more internal ones within more external - are arranged and set out varies from one person to the next according to the way they receive them, and the way each one 
receives them is conditioned by the spiritual and moral development of that person's life in the world; for the life everyone leads in the world remains with them forever.  </p>
<p></p>
<p><b>[2]</b>
 The Lord also flows 
directly into each individual person, for without this direct influx the indirect achieves nothing at all. The reception of direct influx is determined by order as it exists with man or angel, thus by 
Divine Truth emanating from the Divine, for this constitutes that order, <a href="1728.htm">1728</a>, <a href="1919.htm">1919</a>, <a href="2447.htm">2447</a>, <a href="4839.htm">4839</a>, <a href="5703.htm">5703</a>, <a href="7995.htm">7995</a>, <a href="8512.htm">8512</a>, <a href="8513.htm">8513</a>, <a href="8700.htm">8700</a>, <a href="8988.htm">8988</a>. True order for a person therefore is to lead a life of good which 
comes from the Lord, that is, to live from the Lord. The influx is constant; it enters into every single impulse of a person's will and turns it, as far as possible, in the direction of true order; for 
the will that is properly a person's own is constantly drawing him away from such order. The situation is as it is with a person's voluntary and involuntary powers. His voluntary powers are constantly 
drawing him away from order, but his involuntary ones are constantly bringing him back to it. For this reason the motion of the heart, which is involuntary, has been set free completely from the person's 
conscious will, as has the activity of his cerebellum; and the motion of the heart and the forces of the cerebellum control the powers of the will, preventing them from driving on beyond certain 
limits and wearing out the life of the body prematurely. Therefore the chief agents of both powers - of both involuntary powers and voluntary ones - have been joined and work together in the whole 
body. These matters have been mentioned to help to cast some light on the idea regarding the direct and indirect influx from the Lord of the celestial blessings which belong to love and the spiritual 
ones which belong to faith.  </p>

`Et pones mensam ab extra velum': quod significet influxum per caelestia quae amoris, constat ex significatione `mensae' super qua panes facierum, quod sit receptaculum caelestium, de qua n. 9527, 9545, 
et ex significatione `extra velum' quod sit extra medium uniens, per quod influxus mediatus, per `velum' enim {1} significatur medium uniens, n. 9670; et quia mensa illa pone velum erat, ideo significatur 
influxus per caelestia, quae intimi caeli, quae sunt bona amoris; quod ille influxus sit a Domino mediatus per caelum intimum, et immediatus ab Ipso, constare potest (c)a locis supra n. 9682 
ad fin. citatis.  Cum omni bono quod facit vitam caelestem, ita vitam aeternam, apud hominem et apud angelum, ita se habet: intimum boni est Ipse Dominus, proinde bonum amoris quod immediate ab Ipso; 
proxime succedens est bonum amoris mutui, dein bonum charitatis erga proximum, tandem bonum fidei; hic ordo successivus est bonorum ab intimo; inde constare potest quomodo se habet cum influxu immediato 
et mediato {2}; in genere, quantum bonum (o)succedens in ordine seu exterius in se habet bonum interius, tantum est bonum, nam tantum propius est (o)Ipsi Domino, Qui est bonum intimum {3}, ut dictum 
est; sed dispositio et ordinatio bonorum interiorum in exterioribus successiva {4} variatur in omnibus et singulis subjectis secundum receptionem, et receptio secundum vitam cujusvis spiritualem et 
moralem in mundo, nam vita {5} in mundo manet unumquemvis in aeternum. 	[2] Influxus Domini est quoque immediatus apud unumquemvis, nam absque immediato influxu mediatus nihil efficit; immediatus influxus 
recipitur {6} secundum ordinem, in quo homo seu angelus est, ita secundum Divinum Verum quod a Divino, hoc enim {7} est ordo, n. 1728, 1919, (x)2447, 4839, 5703, 7995, 8512, 8513, 8700, 8988; ipse 
ordo (o)itaque apud hominem est ut vivat {8} in bono quod a Domino, quod est ut vivat {9} a Domino; hic influxus continuus est, et (x)adjunctus omnibus et singulis voluntatis hominis, et (t)illa dirigit 
quantum potest ad ordinem; voluntas enim propria hominis continue abducit reum ab ordinem; se habet hoc sicut cum voluntariis et involuntariis apud hominem; voluntaria ejus continue abducunt ab 
ordine, sed involuntaria continue reducunt ad ordinem; inde est quod motus cordis, (o)qui est involuntarius, plane exemptus sit a voluntate hominis, similiter actio cerebelli, et quod cordis motus (c)ac 
cerebelli vires (t)regant voluntaria, ne (o)haec extra limites ruant, et ante tempus exstinguant vitam corporis; propterea {10} principia agentia ex utrisque, nempe tam (c)ex involuntariis quam (o)ex 
voluntariis in toto corpore conjuncta incedunt.  Haec dicta sunt ut illustretur (o)aliquo modo idea de influxu immediato et mediato {11} caelestium amoris et spiritualium fidei a Domino, etiam involuntaria 
apud hominem correspondent caelestibus quae amoris, et spiritualibus quae fidei. </p>
