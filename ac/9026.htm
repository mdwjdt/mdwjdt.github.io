<h3 align="center" class="ired">属天的奥秘 第9026节</h3>
<h4 align="center"></h4><p><strong>9026.</strong>“尚且不至于死”表并且它没有被消灭。这从“死”的含义清楚可知，“死”是指不再像以前那样（参看<a href="494.htm">494</a>，<a href="6587.htm">6587</a>，<a href="6593.htm">6593</a>节），因而是指被消灭，在此是指没有被消灭。由于内义在此论述的是信之真理与圣言字义的真理的一致性，并且圣言字义的真理不可能被消灭，因为它们是秩序最低层中的真理，所以此处没有提到打人以致他死的，只提到打人尚且不至于死的。事实上，圣言字义的真理虽能被削弱，但不能被消灭；此外，它们被削弱之后，就可以先放到一边，然后就能通过解释它们的含义而得以恢复。这些事就是关于被同伴打了，但能起来扶杖而走之人的条例所表示的。<br />人若探究圣言的内在内容，就能看出，为了某个隐藏的原因（一个超越人类理解力的原因，除非这理解力被天堂之光光照），主规定只要被打的人能起床扶杖走到外面，那打人的可算无罪；尤其主规定，打了奴仆，奴仆在一两天之内不死的，可以不受报应或惩罚，因为奴仆就等于他的银子；而事实上，这是夺走人的生命，因为奴仆虽是一个奴仆，但也是一个人。不过，主做出这些规定的隐藏原因若不凭借内义，就不明显；而内义论述的主题是源于圣言的教会真理。这些真理的情况是相似的，因为与同伴相争并打了他的人，以及打奴仆或婢女的人在灵义上表示与这些行为相对应、正在此处被解释的那类事物。在以色列民族当中设立的是一个代表性教会，也就是一个天堂和教会的内在事物要在其中通过外在事物来代表的教会。因此，一旦主揭开并启示教会的内在事物，所规定、甚至命令的这些事就不再具有任何法律效力。自那时起，人们被要求过一种内在的生活，也就是信与仁的生活，以及由内在事物所构成的那种外在生活。</p>

And he dieth not. That this signifies "and it is not extinguished" is evident from the signification of "dying," as being to cease to be such as before (see n. 494, 6587, 6593), consequently to be extinguished, 
here not to be extinguished. As the internal sense here treats of the agreement of the truths of faith with the truths of the literal sense of the Word, and as the truths of the literal sense 
of the Word cannot be extinguished, because they are truths in the ultimate of order, therefore the smiting of a man from which he dies is not here treated of, but only the smiting of a man from which 
he does not die; for the truths of the literal sense of the Word can indeed be invalidated, but cannot be extinguished. Moreover after they have been invalidated, they can be set aside, but again 
by an unfolding of their meaning they can be restored. These things are signified by what was decreed about a man smitten by his companion, but rising again and walking upon his staff. [2] He who investigates 
the interior things of the Word can see that for some secret reason which does not fall under the understanding unless this is enlightened by the light of heaven, it was decreed by the Lord 
that the smiter should be guiltless, if the person smitten rose again from his bed and walked abroad upon his staff; and especially that it was decreed by the Lord that he who smiteth his servant, and 
the servant die not for a day or two, should not be punished, because he is his silver; when yet this is the taking away of a man's life, for the servant is a man, although a servant. But the secret 
reason why it was so decreed by the Lord does not appear except by means of the internal sense, in which the subject treated of is the truths of the church derived from the Word, the case with which 
is similar, when by "a man disputing and smiting his neighbor," and also by "a man smiting his manservant and his maidservant," are meant such things as in the spiritual sense correspond, and which are 
now unfolded. With the Israelitish nation there was instituted a representative church, that is, a church in which the internal things which are of heaven and the church were represented by external 
things. Therefore such things were decreed, and indeed commanded, as have no validity as laws since the internal things of the church were opened and revealed by the Lord; for since that time man is 
to live an internal life, which is a life of faith and charity, and such an external life as internal things make it. </p>

'And he does not die' means, and it is not wiped out. This is clear from the meaning of 'dying' as ceasing to be such, dealt with in <a href="494.htm">494</a>, <a href="6587.htm">6587</a>, <a href="6593.htm">6593</a>, and therefore as being wiped out, at this point not 
being wiped out. Since the internal sense deals here with the agreement of the truths of faith with things stated in the literal sense of the Word, and since things stated in the literal sense of the 
Word cannot be wiped out, being truths on the lowest level of order, no reference is made here to a man who is struck and as a result dies, only to a man who is struck but does not as a result die. 
For things stated in the literal sense of the Word can, it is true, be weakened but they cannot be wiped out; and also after they have been weakened they can be separated, and then be restored by the 
use of explanations. This is what is meant by the regulations regarding a man who, having been struck by a companion, rises up and walks on his staff.  </p>

<p><b>[2]</b>
 A person who probes into the inner contents 
of the Word can see that there was some hidden reason - a reason beyond human understanding unless this is enlightened by the light of heaven - why the Lord stipulated that the striker should be guiltless 
if the one who had been struck rose from his bed and walked outside on his staff; and especially why the Lord stipulated that no vengeance should be taken on someone if he strikes his slave but 
the slave does not die within a day or two, because he is his silver (in spite of the fact that it is the taking of human being's life, for one who is a slave is still a human being). But the hidden 
reason why the Lord made these stipulations is not evident except with the aid of the internal sense, in which the Church's truths derived from the Word are the subject. What can happen to these truths 
is similar, for by a man quarrelling with and striking his companion, and also by a man striking his male or female slave, are meant the kinds of things to which those actions correspond in the spiritual 
sense, which are being explained here. Among the Israelite nation it was a representative Church that was established, that is, a Church in which the inner realities of heaven and the Church were 
to be represented by means of outward things. Therefore things were stipulated, indeed commanded, such as would cease to have any validity as laws once the Lord had disclosed and revealed the inner 
realities of the Church. Since then people have been required to lead an inward life, which is a life of faith and charity, as well as an outward life shaped by inner realities. </p>

`Et non moritur': quod significet et non exstinguitur, constat ex significatione `mori' quod sit {1}desinere esse talis, de qua n. 494, 6587, 6593, proinde exstingui, hic non exstingui.  Quia in sensu 
interno hic agitur de concordantia verorum fidei cum illis quae sunt sensus {2}litteralis Verbi, et quia ea quae sunt sensus {2}litteralis Verbi non possunt exstingui, quoniam sunt vera in ultimo ordinis, 
idcirco non agitur hic de percussione viri ex qua moritur, sed solum de percussione viri ex qua non moritur, nam quae sensus {2}litteralis Verbi sunt, quidem infirmari possunt at non extingui; 
et quoque postquam infirmata sunt, possunt separari ac dein per explicationem restitui; quae significantur per illa quae de viro percusso a socio, ac surgente et ambulante super scipione suo, statuta 
sunt. Qui Verbi interiora rimatur potest videre quod propter arcanam 2 causam quae non sub intellectum nisi illustratum {3}a luce caeli cadit, a Domino statutum sit quod percutiens insons esset, si 
percussus surrexerit e lecto et ambulaverit foris super scipione suo; et magis quod a Domino statutum sit quod qui percutit servum suum, et is non moritur intra diem aut biduum, non vindicaretur, quia 
est argentum ejus, cum tamen {4}sit privatio vitae hominis, est enim homo tametsi servus; sed arcana causa cur ita a Domino statutum {5}sit, non patet nisi quam per sensum internum in quo agitur de veris 
Ecclesiae ex Verbo, cum quibus similiter se habet, {6}cum per virum litigantem et percutientem socium, et quoque {7}per virum percutientem servum suum {8}et ancillam suam, intelliguntur talia quae 
in sensu spirituali correspondent, quae nunc explicantur; apud gentem {9} Israeliticam fuit instituta Ecclesia repraesentativa, hoc est, Ecclesia in qua interna quae sunt caeli et Ecclesiae, repraesentarentur 
per externa; idcirco talia statuta et mandata quoque sunt quae pro legibus non valent postquam a Domino interna Ecclesiae aperta et revelata sunt, nam tunc homo vitam internam, quae est vita 
fidei et charitatis, victurus est, et {10}illam externam in qua interna faciunt vitam. @1 cessare esse$ @2 literae$ @3 e coelo$ @4 est effusio sanguinis aut$ @5 est$ @6 quum per virum litigantem
