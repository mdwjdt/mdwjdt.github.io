<h3 align="center" class="ired">属天的奥秘 第679节</h3>
<h4 align="center"></h4><p>679．“积蓄在你那里”表真理，这一点从前面所述清楚可知。因为“积蓄”涉及存于人的记忆中之物，它们在此被集中起来。这句话进一步表明，在人重生之前，良善和真理这二者必须被集中在人里面。事实上，若非良善和真理被集中起来，充当主重生人的工具，人永远无法重生，如前所述。由此可知，“作你和它们的食物”表示良善和真理。</p>

<p><strong>[NCE]679.</strong> The symbolism of he was to gather it to himself as what is true follows as a consequence, since gather is used of the items in our memory; they are "gathered" there. In addition, this clause involves the idea that both — goodness and truth — are collected in us before we undergo regeneration. Without a collection of good feelings and true ideas to serve as instruments for the Lord's work, we could never be regenerated, as just noted. This leads to the conclusion that it was to serve him and them as food symbolizes both. </p>
<p align="center"><b>Potts(1905-1910) 679</b></p><p><b>679.</b>
That "gathering to himself" means truths, is therefore evident; for "gathering" is predicated of the things that are in man's memory, where they are gathered together. And the expression further implies 
that both goods and truths should be gathered in man before he is regenerated; for without goods and truths gathered together, through which as means the Lord may operate, a man can never be regenerated, 
as has been said. From this then it follows that "it shall be for food for thee and for them" signifies both goods and truths. </p>

<p align="center"><b>Elliott(1983-1999) 679</b></p><p><b>679.</b>
'He was to gather them for himself' means truths. This is clear from what has been stated above, for 'gathering' has reference to the things that are in a person's memory, where they have been gathered 
together. It embodies in addition the point that the former and the latter - goods and truths - need to be gathered together in man before regeneration takes place. Indeed unless goods and truths have 
been gathered together to serve as means through which the Lord may do His work, a person cannot possibly be regenerated, as has been stated. From this it follows then that 'it was to be food for 
him and them' means both goods and truths. </p>

<p align="center"><b>Latin(1748-1756) 679</b>
</p><b>679.</b>
Quod 'colligeret ad se' significent vera, constat inde, nam de illis praedicatur 'colligere' quae in memoria hominis ubi collecta sunt: et praeterea involvit quod illa et haec, seu bona et vera, colligerentur 
apud hominem antequam regeneratur; absque enim bonis et veris collectis per quae, ut per media, operetur Dominus, nusquam potest homo regenerari, ut dictum; inde nunc sequitur quod 'esset ei 
et illis in cibum' significet utrumque. </p>
