There are also kidneys called the subsidiary kidneys, or renal capsules. Their function is to secrete not so much the serum as the blood itself, and to transmit the purer blood toward the heart by a 
short circuit, and thus prevent the spermatic vessels, which are near, from carrying off all the purer blood. But these organs perform their main work in embryos, and also in newborn infants. It is chaste 
virgins who constitute this province in the Grand Man: prone to anxieties, and fearful of being disturbed, they lie quiet at the lower left side of the body. If there is any thought about heaven, 
or about a change of their state, they become anxious and sigh, as I have several times been given plainly to feel. When my thoughts were led to infants, they felt great comfort and inward joy, which 
they frankly confessed; and when there was any thought that had nothing heavenly in it, they were distressed. Their anxiety comes chiefly from their being of such a nature that they keep their thoughts 
fixed on one subject, and do not dispel anxious feelings by variety. The reason why they belong to this province is that in this way they keep another's lower mind fixed on certain thoughts, the result 
being that such things arise and show themselves as cohere in a series, and as are to be drawn away, or from which the man is to be purified. In this way also interior things lie in plainer view 
to the angels; for when such things as obscure and turn away the thoughts are removed, there results a clearer insight and influx. </p>

There are also kidneys which are called the Subsidiary Kidneys and also the Renal Capsules. The function of these is not so much to separate fluid as actual blood, sending the purer blood by a short 
route round to the heart, thus ensuring that neighbouring spermatic vessels do not take away all the purer blood. But their chief work is performed in embryos and also new-born babies. Chaste virgins 
are the ones who constitute that province in the Grand Man; easily given to anxious feelings and fearful of being disturbed, they lie quietly on the lower left side of the body. If I think about heaven 
or about a change in their state, they become anxious and sigh, as I have been allowed to detect plainly on several occasions. When my thoughts turned to young children those virgins felt a significant 
comfort and an inner joy, to which they openly bore witness. Also whenever my thought has dwelt on something unheavenly, they have again experienced anxious feelings. Those feelings stem primarily 
from the fact that those virgins have an innate disposition to keep their minds fixed on one particular concern and not get rid of those anxious feelings by turning to other matters. They belong to that 
province because by behaving in this way they can fix another's mind constantly on certain particular thoughts, as a consequence of which a succession of such matters as must be taken away from a 
person and from which he must be purified emerge and reveal themselves. In this way too interior things are made more evident to the angels, for once such things as cause obscurity and divert their attention 
are removed, clearer vision and influx result. </p>

</p><b>5391.</b>
Sunt quoque renes qui Renes succenturiati et quoque Capsulae renales vocantur; illorum munus est non ita secernere serum sed ipsum sanguinem, et puriorem per brevem circulum transmittere versus cor, 
ita quoque praecavere ne vasa spermatica quae vicina sunt, omnem sanguinem puriorem auferant; sed praecipuam operam praestant in embryonibus, et quoque in infantibus recens natis.  Sunt castae virgines 
quae illam provinciam in Maximo Homine constituunt, ad anxietates faciles et timidae ne turbentur, jacent quietae a sinistra lateris parte inferius; si quid de caelo cogitatur, et si quid de status 
earum mutatione, anxiae fiunt et suspirant, quod aliquoties manifeste sentire datum; cum cogitationes meae ducebantur ad infantes, tunc illae sentiebant insigne solatium et gaudium internum quod etiam 
aperte fassae sunt; cum quoque cogitabatur aliquid in quo non caeleste, etiam angebantur; anxietas earum inde praecipue venit quod illa indole sint, ut cogitationes inhaerenter in una re teneant, nec 
varietate discutiant anxia; quod ad provinciam illam pertineant, est quia sic quoque detinent animum alterius constanter in cogitationibus certis, inde exsurgunt et manifestant se talia quae in serie 
cohaerent {1}, quae abstrahenda seu a quibus purificandus homo; sic etiam patent interiora melius angelis, nam amotis talibus quae obscurant et avertunt, fit intuitio clarior et influxus. </p>
