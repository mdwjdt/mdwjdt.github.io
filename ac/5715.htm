<h3 align="center" class="ired">属天的奥秘 第5715节</h3>
<h4 align="center"></h4><p><strong>5715.</strong>有一个巨大的四方形开口出现了，它斜斜地向下延伸到一个相当深的深渊。在深渊的底部，我看见一个圆形开口，那时这个开口是敞开的，但很快就关上了。一股危险的令人恼火的热气从那里冒上来，是各种地狱发出的集合物。它是由各种恶欲产生的，如傲慢、淫乱、通奸、仇恨、报复、争吵和打斗。存在于这些地狱中的这些欲望就是正在往上冒的那股热气的来源。当它作用于我的身体时，立刻带来一种像发烧那样的疾病；但是，一旦这股热气不再流入我，该疾病的症状便立刻消失。当人患上诸如从他的生活中所染上的那种疾病时，那么对他来说，对应于该疾病的一种不洁气场就粘附上去，作为发病的原因出现。为叫我确切地知道，事实的确如此，来自众多地狱的灵人与我在一起。由他们的散发物所产生的气场通过他们传给了我；随着该气场被允许作用于我身体的实体部位，我被一种压迫、疼痛，甚至相对应的疾病控制住。但是，就在这些灵人被赶走的那一刻，这些感觉就消失了。为叫我没有怀疑的余地，这样的经历重复了上千次。</p>

<p align="center"><b>Potts(1905-1910) 5715</b></p><p><b>5715.</b>
There once appeared a great quadrangular opening that extended obliquely downward to a considerable depth. In the deep was seen a round opening, which was then open but presently was closed. From it 
exhaled a dangerous heat, collected from various hells, and arising from cupidities of various kinds, as from arrogance, lewdness, adultery, hatred, revenge, quarrels, and fights, from which arise in 
the hells such heat as exhaled. When it acted upon my body it instantly brought on disease like that of a burning fever; but when it ceased to flow in, this effect of disease at once ceased. When a man 
falls into such a disease as he has contracted from his life, then forthwith an unclean sphere corresponding to the disease attaches itself, and is present as a fomenting cause. That I might know for 
certain that this is the case, there have been spirits with me from a number of hells, through whom the sphere of exhalations thence was communicated; and according as it was permitted to act upon the 
solid parts of the body, I was seized with oppression, with pain, even with the corresponding disease, which ceased in an instant when those spirits were driven away; and that no room for doubt might 
be left, this has been done a thousand times. </p>

A large four-sided opening appeared, falling away at an angle down to a considerable depth. At the bottom I saw a round opening which then lay open but was soon closed. A vexatious heat rose up from 
there, being a collection emanating from various hells. It arose out of various kinds of evil desires, such as pride, lack of sexual restraint, adultery, hatred, revenge, quarreling and fighting. These 
desires present in those hells were the origin of the heat that was rising up. When it acted on my body it instantly caused a sickness like that of a burning fever; but once that heat ceased to come 
into me, this form of sickness instantly departed. When a person falls sick in this way he has contracted his sickness from the life that is his; in his case an unclean sphere corresponding to the sickness 
attaches itself and is present as the cause from which the sickness springs. To enable me to know for certain that this is the case spirits from many hells have been present with me. Through them 
the sphere created out of emanations from them has been communicated to me; and as that sphere has been allowed to act on the solid parts of my body, I have been seized by an ache, pain, and indeed 
the corresponding sickness. But these feelings departed the instant those spirits were driven away. And to leave me in no doubt the experience has been repeated a thousand times.  </p>

Apparuit magna apertura quadrangularis oblique tendens deorsum ad multam profunditatem; in profundo visa est apertura rotunda quae tunc aperta sed mox clausa; inde exhalabat calor infestus qui collectus 
ex variis infernis, oriundus ex cupiditatibus variorum generum, sicut ex fastu, lasciviis, adulteriis, odiis, vindictis, rixis et pugnis, inde in infernis calor ille qui exhalabat; is cum in corpus 
meum agebat, inducebat momento morbum qualis est febris ardentis; at cum cessabat influere, momento cessabat illud morbi.  Cum homo incidit in morbum talem, quem contraxerat ex sua vita, tunc ilico 
sphaera immunda correspondens morbo se adjungit, et adest ut causa fomentans.  Ut scirem pro certo quod res ita se haberet, apud me fuerunt spiritus (c)ex pluribus infernis, per quos communicabatur sphaera 
exhalationum inde, quae sicut {1}permittebatur agere in partes solidas corporis, ita gravedine, dolore, immo morbo correspondente corripiebar, quae momento cessabant sicut spiritus illi expellebantur: 
et ne aliquis locus dubio relinqueretur, hoc millies factum {2}. @1 communicabatur$ @2 i est$ </p>
