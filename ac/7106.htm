<h4 align="center"></h4><p><strong>7106.</strong>出埃及记5:5-9.法老说，看哪，这地的人民如今众多，你们竟叫他们歇下担子！就在那天，法老吩咐百姓中的督工和他们的官长说，你们不可像昨天和前天一样把稻草给百姓作砖，叫他们自己去拾稻草。他们昨天和前天作砖的数目，你们仍旧加在他们身上，一点不可减少！因为他们是懒惰的，所以呼求说，容我们去祭祀我们的神。你们要把更重的工加在这些人身上，叫他们去做，不去理会虚谎的言语。<br />“法老说”表那些侵扰教会真理之人的意愿。“看哪，这地的人民如今众多”表那些属于属灵教会的人为数众多。“你们竟叫他们歇下担子”表他们侵扰得还不够。“就在那天，法老吩咐”表在这种状态下侵扰教会真理的欲望。“百姓中的督工和他们的官长说”表那些最近距离地进行侵扰之人和那些最近距离地接受之人。“你们不可把稻草给百姓”表最低级或最基本的记忆知识，就是最笼统的。“作砖”表用于将要引入的捏造物和虚假。“像昨天和前天一样”表不像在之前的状态下那样。“叫他们自己去拾稻草”表他们要为自己获取这些最低级或最基本的记忆知识。“他们昨天和前天作砖的数目，你们仍旧加在他们身上”表捏造物和虚假将如同在以前状态下那样大量被引入。“一点不可减少”表没有减少。“因为他们是懒惰的”表因为他们没有受到足够的攻击。“所以呼求说，容我们去祭祀我们的神”表因此，他们对这种敬拜已经仔细考虑过了。“你们要把更重的工加在这些人身上”表要加大攻击。“叫他们去做”表为了产生预期的结果。“不去理会虚谎的言语”表免得他们转向真理。</p>

Verses 5-9. And Pharaoh said, Behold the people of the land are now many, and ye have made them cease from their burdens. And Pharaoh commanded in that day the taskmasters in the people, and their officers, 
saying, Ye shall no more give the people straw to make bricks, as yesterday and the day before yesterday; let them go and gather straw for themselves. And the tale of the bricks which they made 
yesterday and the day before yesterday, ye shall lay upon, them; ye shall not take away from it; for they are idle; therefore they cry, saying, Let us go and sacrifice to our God. Let the service be 
made heavier upon the men, and let them do it; and let them not regard the words of a lie. "And Pharaoh said," signifies the will of those who infest the truths of the church; "Behold the people of the 
land are now many," signifies the multitude of those who are of the spiritual church; "and ye have made them cease from their burdens," signifies that they have not infested enough; "and Pharaoh commanded 
in that day," signifies the cupidity of infesting the truths of the church while in that state; "the taskmasters in the people, and their officers, saying," signifies those who most closely infest 
and most closely receive; "Ye shall no more give the people straw," signifies the lowest memory-knowledges which are the most general of all; "to make bricks," signifies for the things fictitious 
and false that will be injected; "as yesterday and the day before yesterday," signifies not as in the former state "let them go and gather straw for themselves," signifies that they should procure for 
themselves these lowest memory-knowledges; "and the tale of bricks, which they made yesterday and the day before yesterday, ye shall lay upon them," signifies that the things fictitious and false must 
be injected in abundance as before; "ye shall not take away from it," signifies without diminution; "for they are idle," signifies that they are not assaulted enough; "therefore they cry, saying, Let 
us go and sacrifice to our God," signifies that consequently they have so much thought about such worship; "let the service be made heavier upon the men," signifies that the assault should be increased; 
"and let them do it," signifies to obtain the effect; "and let them not regard the words of a lie," signifies lest they turn to truths. </p>

Verses 5-9 And Pharaoh said, Behold, the people of the land are now many, and you have made them rest from their burdens. And Pharaoh gave orders that day to the taskmasters over the people and to their 
officers, saying, You shall no longer give the people straw to make bricks, as you did yesterday and the day before;<A name="fntext1"></a><A href="#fn1"><sup>a</sup></a> they must go and gather straw for themselves. And the tally of bricks which they 
were making yesterday and the day before' shall you impose on them; you shall not reduce it. For they are slack; therefore they cry out, saying, Let us go, let us sacrifice to our God. Let the service 
be made heavy on the men, and let them do it and pay no attention to lying words.  </p>
<p>'And Pharaoh said' means the will of those who molest the Church's truths. 'Behold, the people of the land are 
now many' means the greatness in numbers of those who belong to the spiritual Church. 'And you have made them rest from their burdens' means that they have not molested them enough. 'And Pharaoh gave 
orders that day' means a strong desire to molest the Church's truths while in that state. 'To the taskmasters over the people and to their officers, saying' means those in the nearest position to molest, 
and those in the nearest position to receive. 'You shall no longer give the people straw' means the basest kind of factual knowledge, which is the most general of all. 'To make bricks' means for 
fabrications and falsities which are to be introduced. 'As you did yesterday and the day before' means not as in the previous state. 'They must go and gather straw for themselves' means in order that 
they may acquire that basest kind of factual knowledge for themselves. 'And the tally of bricks which they were making yesterday and the day before shall you impose on them' means that fabrications and 
falsities are to be introduced in the same abundance as before. 'You shall not reduce it' means without diminution. 'For they are slack' means because they have not been sufficiently assaulted. 'Therefore 
they cry out, saying, Let us go, let us sacrifice to our God' means that for that reason they give so much thought to such worship. 'Let the service be made heavy on the men means that the assault 
should be enlarged. 'And let them do it' means in order to produce the desired result. 'And pay no attention to lying words means to keep them from turning towards truths.

Vers. 5-9.  Et dixit Pharao, Ecce multi nunc populus terrae, et cessare fecistis illos ab oneribus illorum.  Et praecepit Pharao die illo exactoribus in populo et moderatoribus ejus, dicendo, Non addetis 
dare paleam populo ad laterificandum lateres, sicut heri nudius tertius, illi ibunt et colligant sibi paleam.  Et demensum laterum quod illi facientes heri nudius tertius, ponetis super illos, non 
detrahetis ab illo, quia remissi illi, propterea illi clamant, dicendo, Eamus, sacrificemus Deo nostro.  Aggravetur servitium super viros, et faciant illud, et ne respiciant ad verba mendacii.  `Et 
dixit Pharao' significat voluntatem illorum qui infestant vera Ecclesiae: `Ecce multi nunc populus terrae' significat multitudinem illorum qui ab Ecclesia spirituali: `et cessare fecistis illos ab oneribus 
illorum' significat quod non satis infestaverint: `et praecepit Pharao die illo' significat cupiditatem infestandi vera Ecclesiae dum in illo statu: `exactoribus in populo et moderatoribus ejus, 
dicendo' significat illos qui proxime infestant, et qui proxime recipiunt: `Non addetis dare paleam populo' significat scientifica infima quae omnium communissima: `ad laterificandum lateres' significat 
ad ficticia et falsa quae injicientur: `sicut heri nudius tertius' significat non ut in statu priore: `illi ibunt et colligant sibi paleam' significat ut scientifica illa infima sibi ipsis comparent: 
`et demensum laterum quod illi facientes heri nudius tertius, ponetis super illos' significat quod ficticia et falsa copia qua prius, injicienda: `non detrahetis ab illo' significat absque diminutione: 
`quia remissi illi' significat quia non satis oppugnati: `propterea illi clamant, dicendo, Eamus, sacrificemus Deo nostro' significat quod inde illis tanta cogitatio de tali cultu: `aggravetur 
servitium super viros' significat quod augenda sit impugnatio: `et faciant illud' significat ut sit effectus: `et ne (x)respiciant ad verba mendacii' significat ne se vertant ad vera. </p>
