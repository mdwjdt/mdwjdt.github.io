<h3 align="center" class="ired">属天的奥秘 第2326节</h3>
<h4 align="center"></h4><p><strong>2326.</strong>“就起来迎接”表承认和对仁爱的感觉。这从以下事实清楚可知：即他们一到，罗得立刻承认他们是天使；而所多玛人则不是这样，关于他们，经上说“呼叫罗得，对他说，今晚到你这里来的人在哪里呢？把他们带出来，任我们所为”（19:5）。就内义而言，这些话表示那些具有仁之善的教会中人承认“那两个天使”所表示的主的神圣人性和神圣活动，但那些没有仁之善的人则不承认。这些话还包含对仁爱的感觉，这从以下事实明显看出来：即代表那些具有仁之善之人的罗得（事实上，“罗得”表源于仁爱的良善本身）邀请他们到他舍下。</p>

And he rose up to meet them. That this signifies acknowledgment, as also a disposition of charity, may be seen from the fact that when they came Lot forthwith acknowledged that they were angels; but 
not so the men of Sodom, of whom it is said: "They cried unto Lot, and said, Where are the men that came unto thee this night? Bring them out unto us, that we may know them" (verse 5). In the internal 
sense these words signify that those within the church who are in the good of charity acknowledge the Lord's Divine Human and Holy proceeding (meant by the "two angels"), but not those who are not in 
the good of charity. That the same words likewise involve a disposition of charity, is evident also from the fact that Lot, by whom are represented those who are in the good of charity, nay, by whom 
is signified the good of charity itself, invited them into his house. </p>

'And he rose up to meet them' means acknowledgement, and also a feeling of charity. This becomes clear from the fact that Lot acknowledged that they were angels the moment they arrived; but the men of 
Sodom did not do so - of whom it is recorded in verse 5, 'They cried out to Lot and said, Where are the men who came to you in the night? Bring them out to us-that we may know them'. In the internal 
sense the words of the present verse mean that those inside the Church with whom the good of charity exists acknowledge the Lord's Divine Human and His Holy proceeding meant by 'the two angels'; but 
those with whom the good of charity does not exist do not acknowledge them. That the same words also embody a feeling of charity is also clear from the fact that Lot, who represents those with whom the 
good of charity exists - indeed 'Lot' means good itself that stems from charity - invited the two angels into his house. </p>

</p><b>2326.</b>
`Et surrexit obviam illis': quod significet agnitionem, ut et charitatis affectum, constare potest ex eo quod Lot, cum venerunt agnoverit ilico quod angeli essent, non autem viri Sodomae, de quibus 
ita, `Clamaverunt ad Lot, et dixerunt, Ubi viri qui venerunt ad te noctu?  Adduc eos ad nos, ut cognoscamus eos,' vers. 5; in sensu interno significant haec, quod qui in bono charitatis sunt intra Ecclesiam 
agnoscant Divinum Humanum et Sanctum procedens Domini, per `duos angelos' intellectum, non autem illi qui non in bono charitatis.  Quod etiam eadem verba involvant charitatis affectum, constat 
etiam inde quod Lot, per quem repraesentantur illi qui in bono charitati sunt, immo significatur ipsum bonum charitatis, invitaverit illos in domum suam. </p>
