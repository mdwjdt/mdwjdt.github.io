<h3 align="center" class="ired">属天的奥秘 第3246节</h3>
<h4 align="center"></h4><p><strong>3246.</strong>“亚伯拉罕把礼物给了他所有的众妾的儿子们”表那些被主的神性人所接纳的属灵之人，他们在主的属灵国度都有指定的地方。这从“众妾的儿子们”和“礼物”的含义，以及“亚伯拉罕”的代表清楚可知：“众妾的儿子们”是指下文所论述的那些属灵之人；“亚伯拉罕”在此是指主的神性人，所以“他（即亚伯拉罕）所有的”表示他们，就是属灵之人被主的神性人所接纳；“礼物”是指主的属灵国度所指定的地方。<br />从前面有关那些构成主的属灵国度、被称为属灵之人的数处说明（如<a href="3235.htm">3235</a>节等）可以看出，他们并非良善与真理的婚姻本身所生的儿子，而是由不怎么具有婚姻性质的一个契约所生的儿子。诚然，他们出身于同一个父亲，但并非出身于同一个母亲；也就是说，他们出身于相同的神性良善，而非出身于相同的神性真理。属天之人来自良善与真理的婚姻本身，所以他们具有良善和植根于这良善的真理。他们从来不去探究何为真理，而是通过良善而直觉它。他们也不谈论真理，而是断定这就是真理，正如主在马太福音中所教导的那样：<br />你们的话，是，就说是；不是，就说不是；若再多说，就是从恶里出来的。（马太福音<a href="http://39-27.cn/太5.37.htm">5:37</a>）<br />而属灵之人来自不那么具有婚姻性质的契约，故无法通过直觉知道何为真理。相反，他们视父母和老师所告知他们的真理为真理。因此，他们里面并没有良善与真理的婚姻。但是，若他们具有生活的良善（参看<a href="1832.htm">1832</a>节），他们因上述原因而相信的真理仍被主当作真理接纳。这解释了为何属灵之人在此被称作“妾的儿子”，“妾的儿子”表示目前所提到的基土拉的所有子孙，以有稍后（25:12-18）所提到的夏甲的子孙。<br />在以前的年代，为了能以婚姻代表属天之人和属灵之人，男人可以在妻子之外纳妾。这妾由妻子送给丈夫，此时，这妾被称为他的“女人”，或被说成是送给他的女人，如当埃及人夏甲被撒拉送给亚伯拉罕时的情感（创世记<a href="http://39-27.cn/创16.3.htm">16:3</a>），以及使女辟拉被拉结送给雅各（创世记<a href="http://39-27.cn/创30.4.htm">30:4</a>）、使女悉帕被利亚送给雅各（创世记<a href="http://39-27.cn/创30.9.htm">30:9</a>）时的情形。她们在那里被称为“女人”，而在别处则被称为“妾”，如本节埃及人夏甲，以及辟拉（创世记<a href="http://39-27.cn/创35.22.htm">35:22</a>），和基土拉本人（历代志上<a href="http://39-27.cn/代上1.32.htm">1:32</a>）。<br />这些古人在妻子之外还有妾室，不仅亚伯拉罕和雅各是这样，而且他们的后代，如基甸（士师记<a href="http://39-27.cn/士8.31.htm">8:31</a>）、扫罗（撒母耳记下<a href="http://39-27.cn/撒下3.7.htm">3:7</a>）、大卫（撒母耳记下<a href="http://39-27.cn/撒下5.13.htm">5:13</a>；<a href="http://39-27.cn/撒下15.16.htm">15:16</a>）和所罗门（列王记上<a href="http://39-27.cn/王上11.3.htm">11:3</a>）也是这样。其原因在于，他们为了代表的缘故被允许这样做。也就是说，是为了妻子代表属天教会，妾代表属灵教会。他们之所以被允许这样做，是因为他们是那种没有婚姻之爱的男人；对他们来说，婚姻不是婚姻，仅仅是为了繁衍后代的一种肉体交合。对这种人来说，这些许可是可接受的，不会对婚姻之爱、因而对婚约造成伤害。但是，对那些处于良善与真理，成为或能成为内在人的人来说，这类许可是永不可接受的。因为一旦人处于良善与真理，并处于内在事物，这类许可就终止了。这就是为何基督徒不可以像犹太人那样在妻子之外纳妾的原因，因为这是行淫。属灵之人被主的神性人所接纳，这从前面有关该主题的阐述和说明（<a href="2661.htm">2661</a>，<a href="2716.htm">2716</a>，<a href="2833.htm">2833</a>，<a href="2834.htm">2834</a>节）可以看出来。</p>

And to the sons of the concubines that Abraham had, Abraham gave gifts. That this signifies the spiritual adopted by the Lord's Divine Human, that they have allotted places in His spiritual kingdom, 
is evident from the signification of the "sons of the concubines," as denoting those who are spiritual (concerning whom in what follows); from the representation here of Abraham, as being the Lord's Divine 
Human; so that by the words "which Abraham had," is signified that they (namely, the spiritual) were adopted by the Lord's Divine Human; and from the signification of the "gifts" which Abraham gave 
them, as being allotted places in the Lord's spiritual kingdom. [2] From what has already been shown in several places (as n. 3235, and elsewhere) concerning those who constitute the Lord's spiritual 
kingdom and are called the spiritual, it can be seen that they are not sons born of the marriage itself of good and truth, but of a certain covenant not so conjugial; they are indeed from the same 
father, but not from the same mother; that is, they are from the same Divine good, but not from the same Divine truth. For as the celestial are from the very marriage of good and truth, they have good 
and thence truth; wherefore they never inquire what is true, but perceive it from good; and they discourse not about truth beyond affirming that it is so-according to what the Lord teaches in Matthew: </p>
<p> 
    Let your speech be, Yea, yea; Nay, Nay; for whatsoever is more than these cometh of evil (Matt. 5:37); </p>
<p>whereas the spiritual, because they are from a covenant not so conjugial, do not know 
from any perception what truth is, but call that true which they have been told to be so by parents and masters; and therefore in them there is not the marriage of good and truth; but still the truth 
which they thus believe is adopted by the Lord for truth when they are in the good of life (concerning this see n. 1832). Therefore it is that those who are spiritual are here called the "sons of the 
concubines," and by these are meant all the sons of Keturah hitherto enumerated, and also the sons of Hagar, who will be named immediately below, from the twelfth to the eighteenth verse. [3] In former 
times, in order that both the celestial and the spiritual might be represented in marriages, it was permissible for a man to have a concubine in addition to a wife; such concubine being given to the 
husband by the wife, and she was then called his "woman," or was said to be "given to him for a woman," as when Hagar the Egyptian was given to Abraham by Sarah (Gen. 16:3); when Bilhah the handmaid 
was given by Rachel to Jacob (Gen. 30:4), and the handmaid Zilpah to Jacob by Leah (Gen. 30:9). They are there called "women," but elsewhere they are called "concubines," as Hagar the Egyptian in this 
verse, and Bilhah in Genesis 35:22, also Keturah herself in 1 Chronicles 1:32. [4] That those ancients had concubines besides a wife, as was the case not only with Abraham and Jacob, but also with 
their descendants, as Gideon (Judges 8:31), Saul (2 Sam. 3:7), David (2 Sam. 5:13; 15:16), and Solomon (1 Kings 11:3), was of permission, for the sake of the representation, namely, of the celestial church 
by a wife, and of the spiritual church by a concubine: this was of permission because they were such that they had no conjugial love, neither was marriage to them marriage, but only a carnal coupling 
for the sake of procreating offspring. To such there might be permissions without injury to conjugial love, and consequently to its covenant; but never to those who are in good and truth, and who 
are or can become internal men; for as soon as man is in good and truth, and in things internal, such things cease. For this reason it is not allowable for Christians, as it was for the Jews, to take 
to themselves a concubine together with a wife, for this is adultery. That the spiritual were adopted by the Lord's Divine Human, may be seen from what has been stated and shown before on the same subject 
(n. 2661, 2716, 2833, 2834). </p>

<p align="center"><b>Elliott(1983-1999) 3246</b></p><p><b>3246.</b>
'And to the concubines' sons, whom Abraham had, Abraham gave gifts' means that places in the Lord's spiritual kingdom were allotted to spiritual people adopted by the Lord's Divine Human. This is clear 
from the meaning of 'the concubines' sons' as those who are spiritual, to be dealt with below; from the representation of 'Abraham' here as the Lord's Divine Human (so that the words 'whom Abraham 
had' mean that they - those who were spiritual - were adopted by the Lord's Divine Human); and from the meaning of 'the gifts which Abraham gave them' as allotted places in the Lord's spiritual kingdom. </p>
<p></p>
<p><b>[2]</b>
From what has been shown several times already about those who constitute the Lord's spiritual kingdom and who are called the spiritual, as in <a href="3235.htm">3235</a> and elsewhere, it becomes clear that they 
are not sons of the marriage itself of good and truth, but of a certain covenant not so conjugial. They are indeed descended from the same father but not from the same mother, that is, from the same Divine 
Good but not from the same Divine Truth. Indeed with those who are celestial, since they are the product of the marriage itself of good and truth, good exists and truth rooted in that good. They 
never make investigations into what the truth may be but have a perception of it from good. Nor in conversation do they say more than this regarding what is true, 'Yes, that is so', in keeping with the 
Lord's teaching in Matthew, </p>
<blockquote>
Let your words be Yes, yes; No, no; anything beyond this is from evil.<A name="fntext1"></a><A href="#fn1"><sup>a</sup></a> <a href="http://bible.gospelcom.net/cgi-bin/bible?passage=Matt%205:37&amp;version=ESV&amp;interface=print&amp;showfn=yes&amp;showxref">Matt 5:37</a>. 
</blockquote>
<p>But those who are spiritual, since they are the product of a covenant not so conjugial, 
do not have any perception from which they can know what is true. Instead they call that the truth which parents and teachers have told them to be the truth. Consequently with them there is no 
marriage of good and truth. Nevertheless that which they believe to be the truth for the reason just given is adopted by the Lord as truth when goodness of life exists with them; see <a href="1832.htm">1832</a>. This now 
explains why the spiritual are here called 'the concubines' sons', which is used to mean all the sons of Keturah mentioned already, and also those descended from Hagar, dealt with shortly below in verses 12-18. </p>
<p></p>
<p><b>[3]</b>
 In former times- to enable both those who are celestial and those who are spiritual to be represented in marriages - a man was allowed to have a concubine in addition to a wife. That 
concubine was given to the husband by his wife (uxor), in which case the concubine was called his wife (mulier), or was said to have been given to him as a wife (mulier), as when Hagar the Egyptian was 
given to Abraham by Sarah, <a href="http://bible.gospelcom.net/cgi-bin/bible?passage=Gen%2016:3&amp;version=ESV&amp;interface=print&amp;showfn=yes&amp;showxref">Gen 16:3</a>, when the servant-girl Bilhah was given to Jacob by Rachel, <a href="http://bible.gospelcom.net/cgi-bin/bible?passage=Gen%2030:4&amp;version=ESV&amp;interface=print&amp;showfn=yes&amp;showxref">Gen 30:4</a>, and when the servant-girl Zilpah was given to Jacob by Leah, <a href="http://bible.gospelcom.net/cgi-bin/bible?passage=Gen%2030:9&amp;version=ESV&amp;interface=print&amp;showfn=yes&amp;showxref">Gen 30:9</a>. In those cases they 
are called 'wives' (mulier), but elsewhere concubines, as is Hagar the Egyptian in the present verse, Bilhah in <a href="http://bible.gospelcom.net/cgi-bin/bible?passage=Gen%2035:22&amp;version=ESV&amp;interface=print&amp;showfn=yes&amp;showxref">Gen 35:22</a>, and even Keturah herself in <a href="http://bible.gospelcom.net/cgi-bin/bible?passage=1%20Chron%201:32&amp;version=ESV&amp;interface=print&amp;showfn=yes&amp;showxref">1 Chron 1:32</a>. </p>
<p></p>
<p><b>[4]</b>
 The reason why those men 
of old had concubines in addition to a wife, as not only Abraham and Jacob did, but also their descendants, such as Gideon, <a href="http://bible.gospelcom.net/cgi-bin/bible?passage=Judg%208:31&amp;version=ESV&amp;interface=print&amp;showfn=yes&amp;showxref">Judg 8:31</a>; Saul, <a href="http://bible.gospelcom.net/cgi-bin/bible?passage=2%20Sam%203:7&amp;version=ESV&amp;interface=print&amp;showfn=yes&amp;showxref">2 Sam 3:7</a>; David, <a href="http://bible.gospelcom.net/cgi-bin/bible?passage=2%20Sam%205:13;%2015:16&amp;version=ESV&amp;interface=print&amp;showfn=yes&amp;showxref">2 Sam 5:13; 15:16</a>; Solomon, <a href="1.htm">1</a> Kings 
11:3, was that they were permitted to do so for the sake of the representation. That is to say, the celestial Church was represented by the wife, and the spiritual Church by the concubine. They were permitted 
to do so because they were the kind of men with whom conjugial love did not exist; so that to them marriage was not marriage but merely copulation for the sake of begetting off-spring. With such 
persons those permissions were possible without any harm being done to love or consequently to the conjugial covenant. But such permissions are never possible among people with whom good and truth 
are present and who are internal people, or potentially so. For as soon as good and truth, and internal things, exist with the human being, such permissions come to an end. This is why Christians are 
not allowed, as the Jews were, to take a concubine in addition to a wife, and why such is adultery. Regarding the adoption of those who are spiritual by the Lord's Divine Human, see what has been stated 
and shown already on the same subject in <a href="2661.htm">2661</a>, <a href="2716.htm">2716</a>, <a href="2833.htm">2833</a>, <a href="2834.htm">2834</a>.

`Et filiis concubinarum, {1}qui Abrahamo, dedit Abraham dona: quod significet spirituales adoptatos a Divino Humano Domini, quod illis sortes in regno spirituali Domini, constat ex significatione `filiorum 
concubinarum' quod sint spirituales de quibus sequitur: ex repraesentatione `Abrahami' hic, quod sit Divinum Humanum Domini, ita per verba `qui Abrahamo' significatur quod illi, nempe spirituales, 
adoptati sint a Divino Humano Domini: et ex significatione `donorum' quae Abraham illis dedit, quod sint sortes in regno spirituali Domini. [2] Ex illis quae prius aliquoties de illis qui spirituale 
Domini regnum constituunt et spirituales vocantur, ostensa sunt, ut n. 3235 et alibi, constare potest quod illi non filii ex ipso conjugio boni et veri sint, sed {2}ex foedere quodam non ita conjugiali; 
ex eodem quidem patre sunt, sed non ex eadem matre, hoc est, ex eodem Divino Bono, sed non ex eodem Divino Vero: caelestibus enim quia ex ipso conjugio boni et veri sunt, est bonum et inde verum, 
quare nusquam inquirunt quid verum, sed ex bono percipiunt illud; nec de vero ulterior illis sermo est quam quod ita sit, secundum illa quae Dominus docet apud Matthaeum,           Esto sermo vester, 
Ita ita, non non; quod ultra haec est,      ex malo est, v (x)37; </p>
<p>spirituales autem, {3}quia ex foedere non ita conjugiali, non sciunt quid verum ex aliqua perceptione, sed verum dicunt id quod 
a parentibus et magistris illis verum esse dictum est, quare apud illos non est conjugium boni et veri; sed usque verum quod ita credunt, a Domino adoptatur pro vero, quando in bono vitae sunt; videantur 
de his n. 1832. Inde nunc est quod spirituales hic dicantur `filii concubinarum' et per illos intelligantur omnes filii Keturae hactenus nominati, tum quoque filii ex Hagare, de quibus mox infra vers. 
12-18, [3] Ut repraesentarentur et caelestes et spirituales in conjugiis olim, concessum fuit praeter uxorem etiam concubinam habere; concubina illa dabatur marito ab uxore, et tunc dicebatur ejus 
mulier, seu quod data sit ei in mulierem, sicut cum Hagar Aegyptia Abrahamo a Sarah, Gen. xvi 3, cum ancilla Bilhah Jacobo ex Rachele, Gen. xxx 4, et cum ancilla Zilpah Jacobo ex Lea, Gen. xxx 9; ibi 
dicuntur `mulieres,' sed alibi `concubinae,' {4}ut Hagar Aegyptia in hoc versu; Bilhah, Gen. xxxv 22, etiam ipsa Keturah I Paral. i 32. [4] Quod antiqui illi concubinas habuerint praeter uxorem, sicut 
non modo Abraham et Jacob, sed etiam posteri illorum, ut Gideon, Jud. viii 31; Saul, 2 Sam. iii 7; David, 2 Sam. v 13; xv 16; Salomo, 1 Reg. xi 3, erat ex permissione, repraesentationis causa, nempe 
Ecclesiae caelestis per uxorem, et Ecclesiae spiritualis per concubinam; ex permissione quia tales fuerunt ut illis nullus amor conjugialis, ita nec conjugium illis conjugium, sed modo copulatio carnalis 
sobolis procreandae causa; talibus absque laesione amoris et inde foederis conjugialis permissiones esse potuerunt, nusquam autem illis qui in bono et vero sunt, et qui interni homines sunt vel 
fieri possunt; ut primum enim homo in bono et vero est, ac in internis, cessant talia; inde est quod Christianis non liceat, sicut Judaeis, ad uxorem sibi aliquam concubinam adjungere, et quod hoc adulterium 
sit. Quod spirituales adoptati sint a Divino Humano Domini, videantur quae de eadem re prius n. 2661, 2716, 2833, 2834 dicta et ostensa sunt. @1 quae I$  @2 A had ex conjunctione quadam extra
