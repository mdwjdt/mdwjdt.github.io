<h3 align="center" class="ired">属天的奥秘 第7710节</h3>
<h4 align="center"></h4><p><strong>7710.</strong>“你向天伸手”表在天上行使神之真理的能力。这从“伸手”和“天”的含义，以及摩西的代表清楚可知：“伸手”是指能力的行使，如前所述（<a href="7673.htm">7673</a>节）；将要伸手的摩西是指神的真理（参看<a href="6723.htm">6723</a>，<a href="6752.htm">6752</a>，<a href="7010.htm">7010</a>，<a href="7014.htm">7014</a>，<a href="7382.htm">7382</a>节）；“天”是指天使天堂。至于在天上行使神之真理的能力会在侵扰者当中产生一个新状态，该状态由“幽暗”来表示，是怎么回事，这从前面所示（<a href="7643.htm">7643</a>，<a href="7679.htm">7679</a>节）明显看出来，即：主不断重整天堂，使之归入秩序，并将属天和属灵的良善赋予那些在天堂里的人和新来者。这种重新整理，归入秩序的结果是，恶人逐渐经历荒凉；因为重新整理之后，这良善从更接近处于对立面的恶人的位置流入。从神来的流注一直持续到对立面，并以这种方式将地狱保持在联结和拘役中。由于恶人将一切良善变为邪恶，所以他们将从更近位置流入的良善变成更大的邪恶。他们越是这样做，就越强烈地抵制真理和良善，也就是说，对真理和良善的侵扰就越激烈。正因如此，他们所经历的荒凉是分阶段逐渐进行的，直到最终他们被投入地狱，这是荒凉的最后阶段。由此可见，除了良善外，没有什么东西从主发出，祂不使恶人荒凉，更不会将他们投入地狱，这一切都是他们自己造成的。</p>

Stretch out thy hand toward heaven. That this signifies the rule of the power of truth Divine in heaven, is evident from the signification of "stretching out the hand," as being the rule of power (of 
which above, n. 7673); from the representation of Moses, who was to stretch out his hand, as being truth Divine (see n. 6723, 6752, 7010, 7014, 7382); and from the signification of "heaven," as being 
the angelic heaven. How it is that the rule of the power of truth Divine in heaven should produce a new state among the infesters, which is signified by the "thick darkness," is evident from what was 
shown above (n. 7643, 7679), namely, that the Lord is continually setting heaven in order, and endowing those who are there, and those who newly arrive, with celestial and spiritual good. The effect 
of this setting in order is that the evil are gradually devastated; for this good flows in with a nearer presence to the evil who are in the opposite (for the Divine influx continues on even into the 
opposites, and in this way holds the hells together in connection and in bonds), and because the evil turn all good into evil, and therefore turn into greater evil the good which flows in more presently; 
and insofar as they do this, so far they resist the truth and good more strongly, that is, they infest more grievously. Hence it is that there are degrees of devastation, until finally they are cast 
down into hell, which is the last of the degrees of vastation. From all this it is evident that nothing but good proceeds from the Lord, and that He does not vastate the evil, still less cast them 
into hell, but that they themselves do this. </p>

'Stretch out your hand towards heaven' means exercising the power of God's truth in heaven. This is clear from the meaning of 'stretching out the hand' as an exercising of power, dealt with above in <a href="7673.htm">7673</a>; from the representation of Moses, the one who was told to 'stretch out his hand', as God's truth, dealt with in <a href="6723.htm">6723</a>, <a href="6752.htm">6752</a>, <a href="7010.htm">7010</a>, <a href="7014.htm">7014</a>, <a href="7382.htm">7382</a>; and from the meaning of 'heaven' as the angelic heaven. 
How it is that exercising the power of God's truth in heaven could bring about the new state among the molesting ones that is meant by 'thick darkness' is clear from what has been shown in <a href="7643.htm">7643</a>, <a href="7679.htm">7679</a>. 
There it has been shown that the Lord is continually rearranging heaven, and that He endows those in heaven, and newcomers, with celestial and spiritual good. This continual rearranging causes the 
vastation which the evil undergo in stages; for after rearrangement that good flows from a more immediate position towards the evil who are governed by the opposite of such good. (The inflow from God 
continues onwards right into what is opposed to it and in so doing keeps the hells bound and chained.) And since the evil turn all good into evil, they turn into greater evil the good that flows in 
from a more immediate position. The more they do so, the stronger is their resistance to what is good and true, that is, the fiercer is their molestation of it. So it is that the vastation they undergo 
proceeds in stages, till at length they are cast into hell, which is the final stage of it. From all this one may see that what emanates from the Lord is nothing but good, and that He does not lay waste 
the evil, still less cast them into hell, but that they themselves cause it to happen. </p>

`Extende manum tuam ad caelum': quod significet dominium potentiae veri Divini in caelo, constat ex significatione `extendere manum' quod sit dominium potentiae, de qua supra n. 7673; ex repraesentatione 
`Moschis' qui extenderet manum, quod sit verum Divinum, de qua n. 6723, 6752, 7010, 7014, 7382; et ex significatione `caeli' quod sit caelum angelicum.  Quomodo se habet quod dominium potentiae 
veri Divini in caelum produceret apud infestantes novum statum, qui significatur per `caliginem,' constat ex illis quae n. 7643, 7679, ostensa sunt; quod nempe Dominus caelum continue ordinet, ac donet 
illos qui ibi et novos advenas bono caelesti (c)et spirituali; haec ordinatio facit quod mali per gradus devastentur; influit enim bonum illud {1} praesentius ad malos qui in opposito (nam influxus 
Divinus pergit usque in opposita, et sic continet inferna in nexu et in vinculis); et quia mali vertunt omne bonum in malum, ita bonum quod praesentius influit in majus malum; et quantum {2}hoc faciunt, 
tantum resistunt vero et bono fortius, hoc est, infestant gravius; inde est quod devastationis gradus sint, usque dum tandem dejiciuntur in infernum, qui est {3}graduum vastationis ultimus.  Ex his 
constare potest quod a Domino nihil nisi quam bonum procedat, et quod non vastet malos, minus conjiciat illos in infernum, sed quod ipsi hoc faciant. 	@1 i sic$ 	@2 vertunt id in majus malum$ 	@3 gradus$ </p>
