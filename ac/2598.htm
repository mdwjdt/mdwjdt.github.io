<h3 align="center" class="ired">属天的奥秘 第2598节</h3>
<h4 align="center"></h4><p><strong>2598.</strong>当我读士师记十七、十八章有关米迦的内容，即但人如何盗走米迦的雕像、神像和利未人时，有一个来自外邦人的灵人正好在场，<br />他在世时曾敬拜偶像。他听得全神贯注，当听到米迦的遭遇，以及他因被但人盗走的神像而那样悲痛时，便充满忧伤，以致头脑一片空白。我能感觉到他的忧伤和每一丝情感中的纯真。在场有几个基督灵人（Christian spirit），看到一个拜偶像的人竟有如此悲悯的心肠和天真无邪的性情，都感到吃惊。之后，一些善灵与他交谈，指示他不当拜偶像，他本该明白这一点，因为他是一个人。天使告诉他，他的思想应该超越偶像看到神，即整个天和整个地的创造者和治理者，这神就是主。他们在说这些事的时候，我得以感觉到他深深的崇敬之情，这种感情传给我，比我从基督徒所感受到的要神圣得多。我由此看出，照主的话说（路加福音<a href="http://39-27.cn/路13.29.htm">13:29</a>-<a href="http://39-27.cn/路13.30.htm">30</a>），今天的外邦人比基督徒更容易进入天堂，如今的基督徒就没有这样的感情。他处在这样的状态，自能吸收信的一切事物，而且是带着深切的感情来接受。因为他有着怜悯的心肠，这是爱的表现，并且他的无知中带有纯真。有这样的秉性，信的一切事物可以说会被其自然而然、欢喜快乐地接受。此后，他被接到天使当中。</p>

When I read the 17th and 18th chapters of Judges, concerning Micah, how the sons of Dan took away his graven image, the teraphim, and the Levite, there was present a spirit from the Gentiles, who in 
the life of the body had adored a carved image. While he listened attentively to what was done to Micah, and in what grief he was on account of his graven image that the Danites took away, he too was 
overcome with grief, and was affected to such a degree that he scarcely knew what to think for inward grief. I perceived his grief, and at the same time perceived the innocence in each of his affections. 
Christian spirits were also present and observed it, and wondered that a worshiper of a graven image should be moved by so strong an affection of mercy and innocence. Afterwards good spirits spoke 
to him, saying that a graven image ought not to be adored, and that he could understand this because he was a human being; but that he ought to think beyond the graven image of God the Creator and Governor 
of the universal heaven and earth; and that this God is the Lord. When these things were said I was permitted to perceive the interior emotion of his adoration, which was communicated to me, and 
was much more holy than that with Christians; from which it could be seen that Gentiles come into heaven more easily than Christians at this day who are not so affected (according to the Lord's words 
in Luke 13:29, 30); for in the state in which he was he could be imbued with all things of faith, and could receive them with interior affection. There was in him the mercy that is of love, and in his 
ignorance there was innocence; and when these are present, all things of faith are received as it were spontaneously, and with joy. He was afterwards received among the angels. </p>

When I read in Judges <a href="17.htm">17</a> and <a href="18.htm">18</a> about Micah, how the Danites stole his graven image, seraphim, and Levite, a spirit from the gentiles was present who during his lifetime had worshipped a graven image. 
As he listened attentively to what happened to Micah and how he grieved for his graven image which the Danites had taken away, he too was overtaken and filled with grief, so much so that he scarcely 
knew as a result of interior grief what to think. I perceived his grief, and at the same time innocence in every one of his affections. Christian spirits as well were present and looking on and they 
were amazed that the worshipper of a graven image could be filled by so strong a feeling of compassion and innocence. Afterwards good spirits spoke to him, saying that a graven image ought not to be worshipped 
and that this he was able to understand because he was a human being. They told him that instead his thoughts ought to go beyond the graven image to God the Creator and Governor of the whole 
of heaven and the whole of earth, and that this God is the Lord. While they were saying these things I was given to perceive the feeling or emotion within him with which he worshipped, and which was 
communicated to me. It was far more holy than feelings and emotions present in Christians. From this it became clear that gentiles, as accords with the Lord's words in <a href="http://bible.gospelcom.net/cgi-bin/bible?passage=Luke%2013:-29,%2030,%20en&amp;version=ESV&amp;interface=print&amp;showfn=yes&amp;showxref">Luke 13:-29, 30, en</a>ter heaven more 
easily than Christians do today who are not stirred by the same feelings and emotions. For in that state he was able to absorb all things of faith and to receive them with interior affection, since 
there existed in him that compassion which is the expression of love, and his lack of knowledge had innocence within it; and when these are present all things of faith are received so to speak spontaneously, 
and with joy. He was after this received among angels. </p>

Cum legi cap. xvii et xviii Judicum, de Micha quod Danis filii abstulerint ejus sculptile, teraphim, et Levitam, tunc erat spiritus ex gentilibus qui in vita corporis sui adoraverat sculptile; is cum 
attente audiret quid factum Michae, et in quo dolore fuit propter sculptile suum quod abstulerunt Danitae, etiam illum superveniebat et afficiebat dolor, usque adeo ut vix sciret prae interiore dolore 
quid cogitaret; qui dolor perceptus, et simul percepta innocentia in singulis ejus affectionibus: Christiani etiam spiritus aderant et observabant, et mirati sunt quod sculptilis adorator tanta misericordiae 
et innocentiae affectione moveretur: postea boni spiritus cum eo locuti sunt, dicentes quod sculptile non esset adorandum, et quod hoc intelligere posset quia homo sed quod cogitare debeat 
extra sculptile de Deo Creatore et Gubernatore universi caeli et universae terrae, et quod ille Deus esset Dominus: cum haec dicebantur, percipere dabatur ejus adorationis affectum interiorem, qui mecum 
communicabatur, multo sanctiorem quam apud Christianos; ex quo constare potuit quod gentiles facilius in caelum veniant quam Christiani hodie qui non afficiuntur, secundum Domini verba apud Lucam xiii 
29, 30; nam in statu quo erat, potuit imbui omnibus fidei, et illa cum interiore affectione recipere, apud eum erat misericordia quae est amoris, et in ejus ignorantia erat innocenti quae cum adsunt, 
omnia fidei sicut sponte recipiuntur, et hoc cum gaudio: receptus (t)est dein inter angelos. </p>
