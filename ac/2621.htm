<h3 align="center" class="ired">属天的奥秘 第2621节</h3>
<h4 align="center"></h4><p><strong>2621.</strong>“怀了孕，生了”表接受本质存在（essential being）并彰显出来，也就是说，神圣理性通过主的神性属灵之物和神性属天之物的融合而接受本质存在并彰显出来。这从“怀孕和生出”的含义清楚可知。事实上，就圣言的内义而言，怀孕和生产或分娩无非是指属灵和属天的怀孕和生产或分娩（参看<a href="2584.htm">2584</a>节）。但此处是指神性的怀孕和生产，因为所论述的主题是主的理性，这时，它已变成神性；并且存在（Being）和彰显（Esse et Existere）主要是论及祂，也就是主，因为唯独主存在和彰显。此外，存在与彰显看上去似乎一样，但并不一样。一切人或物都通过怀孕接受存在，通过生出接受彰显。因此，存在先于彰显，如同怀孕先于生出。<br />灵魂是人的存在本身，而感觉或身体官能是它的彰显，因为前者在后者里面彰显。属天和属灵之爱就是正经历重生之人的存在本身；而他的理性和感觉充满这爱之时，就是他的彰显。宇宙中的每一个事物都是如此，因为不经孕育而存在和彰显的事物并不存在。这一点也可以学者的哲学术语来说明：一切结果皆其原因，一切原因皆有其目的。目的是原因的存在，原因则是目的的彰显。同样，原因是结果的存在，结果是原因的彰显。</p>

That "conceived and bare" signifies that it Was and Came forth, namely (as follows) the Divine rational, from the unition of the Lord's Divine spiritual with His Divine celestial, is evident from the 
signification of "conceiving and bearing." That in the internal sense of the Word no other conceptions and bearings are meant than those which are spiritual and celestial, may be seen above (n. 2584); 
but here those which were Divine, because the subject here treated of is the Lord's rational made Divine; and of Him, namely, the Lord, Being and Coming forth [Esse et Existere] are chiefly predicated; 
for He alone Is and Comes forth. As regards Being and Coming forth (Esse et Existere) we may add that they seem as if they were nearly the same, but are not the same. Every person and every thing, 
has its Being from conception, but its Coming forth from birth; and thus, as conception is prior to birth, so Being is prior to Coming forth.  [2] The soul is the Being itself of man, and the sensitive 
or corporeal faculty is its Coming forth, for the former comes forth in the latter. Celestial and spiritual love are the very Being of the man who is being regenerated; and the rational and sensitive 
faculties, when imbued with that love, are his Coming forth. And so it is with each and all things in the universe; for there is nothing whatever which has not its conception that it may Be, and its 
birth that it may Come forth; which may also be illustrated in the terms of philosophy by saying that every effect has its cause, and every cause has its end. The end is the Being of the cause, and 
the cause is the Coming forth of the end. In the same way, the cause is the Being of the effect, and the effect is the Coming forth of the cause. </p>

That 'conceived and bore' means received essential being and was given manifestation - that is to say, the Divine Rational received and was given these from the Lord's Divine spiritual united to His 
Divine celestial - is clear from the meaning of 'conceiving and bearing'. The fact that no other kind of conceptions and bearings or childbirths is meant in the internal sense of the Word but spiritual 
and celestial ones, see <a href="2584.htm">2584</a>. But here Divine conceivings and bearings are meant because the subject is the Lord's Rational when it had been made Divine; to Him, that is, to the Lord, are Being and 
Manifestation pre-eminently attributable since He alone has [underived] Being and Manifestation. In addition to this, Being and Manifestation appear to be almost the same as each other, but they are not. 
Every person or thing receives Being by conception but Manifestation by being born; so that Being is prior to Manifestation as conception is prior to birth. </p>
<p></p>
<p><b>[2]</b>
 The soul constitutes a person's 
essential Being, while the powers of the -senses or the body constitute the Manifestation of it; for the former manifests itself in the latter. Celestial and spiritual love is the Being itself of one 
who is being regenerated, while the rational part and the sensory part of him - when these are endowed with that love - are the Manifestation of it. The same may be said of every single thing in the universe, 
for nothing ever exists without conception to give it Being and birth to give it Manifestation. This may also be illustrated for learned people from the idea that every effect has its cause, 
and every cause has its end. The end is the Being of the cause, and the cause is the Manifestation of the end. In the same way the cause is the Being of the effect, and the effect is the Manifestation 
of the cause. </p>

{1}  Quod `concepit et peperit' significet quod esset et existere nempe, ut sequitur, Divinum Rationale ex unitione Divini spiritualis cum Divino caelesti Domini, constat ex significatione `concipere 
parere': quod non alii conceptus et partus in sensu interno Verbi intelligantur quam spirituales et caelestes, videatur n. 2584; hic autem Divini, quia agitur de Rationali Domini Divino facto, de Quo, 
nempe Domino, principaliter praedicatur Esse et Existere, nam Solus Est Existit.  Quod praeterea Esse et Existere attinet, apparent sicut forent paene idem, sed non sunt; unusquisque et unumquodvis 
a conceptione habet suum Esse, a partu autem suum Existere, ita, sicut conceptio est prior quam partus, est Esse prius quam Existere: [2] anima est ipsum Esse hominis, at sensitivum seu corporeum est 
illius Existere, nam illa existit in hoc: amor caelestis et spiritualis est ipsum Esse hominis qui regeneratur, at rationale et sensitivum, cum imbutum est amore illo, est illius Existere; ita se habet 
cum omnibus et singulis in universo, nam nihil usquam datur quod non habet suam conceptionem ut Sit, et suum partum ut Existat; quod ex eo etiam illustrari potest, sed coram eruditis, omnis effectus 
habet suam causam, et omnis causa habet suum finem; finis est Esse causae, et {2} causa est Existere finis pariter causa est Esse effectus, sed effectus est Existere causae. 	@1 There are three deleted
