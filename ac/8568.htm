<h3 align="center" class="ired">属天的奥秘 第8568节</h3>
<h4 align="center"></h4><p><strong>8568.</strong>“百姓在那里甚渴，要喝水”表对真理的渴望增强。这从“渴”和“水”的含义清楚可知：“渴”是指追求和渴望，论及真理，就像“饿”论及良善一样；“水”是指信之真理（参看<a href="8562.htm">8562</a>节）。“渴”表示对“水”所表示的真理的追求和渴望，这一点从圣言中的许多经文明显看出来，如在阿摩司书：<br />看哪，日子将到，我必打发饥荒临到地上，不是食物的饥荒，不是因水的干渴，而是对听耶和华之话的饥渴；他们必飘流，从这海到那海，从北边到东边，往来奔跑寻求耶和华的话，却寻不着。当那日，美貌的处女和少年的男子必因干渴发昏。（阿摩司书<a href="http://39-27.cn/摩8.11.htm">8:11</a>-<a href="http://39-27.cn/摩8.13.htm">13</a>）<br />此处“干渴”描述了对认识真理的渴望；“我必不打发因水的干渴，而是打发对听耶和华之话的饥渴”，以及“他们往来奔跑寻求耶和华的话”表示对真理的渴望；“当那日，美貌的处女和少年的男子必因干渴发昏”描述了真理的缺乏和由此产生的属灵生命的剥夺，“美貌的处女”是指那些具有对良善的情感之人，“少年的男子”是指那些具有对真理的情感之人。<br />以赛亚书：<br />嗬，你们一切干渴的都当就近水来，没有银钱的也可以来。你们都来，买了吃，不用银钱，不用价值，也来买酒和奶。（以赛亚书<a href="http://39-27.cn/赛55.1.htm">55:1</a>）<br />“你们一切干渴的都当就近水来”明显表示渴望信之真理的人；“不用价值，也来买酒和奶”表示从主，因而白白地为自己获得信之良善和真理。“水”表示信之真理（参看<a href="8562.htm">8562</a>节）；“酒”表示信之良善（<a href="6377.htm">6377</a>），“奶”也是（<a href="2184.htm">2184</a>节）。谁都能看出，“就近水来，买酒和奶”在此并非表示酒和奶，而表示属于天堂和教会的那类事物。<br />在启示录也一样：<br />我要将生命水的泉源白白赐给那口渴的人喝。（启示录<a href="http://39-27.cn/启21.6.htm">21:6</a>）<br />“生命水的泉源”表示信之真理和良善；“口渴的人”表示出于对它们的情感渴望它们的人，正如主在约翰福音所说的：<br />耶稣撒马利亚的妇人说，凡喝这水的，还要再渴；人若喝我所赐他的水，就永远不渴。我所赐他的水要在他里头成为水泉，直涌到永生。（约翰福音<a href="http://39-27.cn/约4.13.htm">4:13</a>，<a href="http://39-27.cn/约4.14.htm">14</a>）<br />此处“水”表示从圣言获得的信之真理；“永远不渴”在此表示他不再缺乏真理。<br />类似的话出现在约翰福音的别处：<br />耶稣说，我就是生命的粮，到我这里来的，必定不饿；信我的，永远不渴。（约翰福音<a href="http://39-27.cn/约6.35.htm">6:35</a>）<br />同一福音书：<br />耶稣喊着说，人若渴了，可以到我这里来喝！信我的人，就如经上所说，从他腹中要流出活水的江河来。（约翰福音<a href="http://39-27.cn/约7.37.htm">7:37</a>，<a href="http://39-27.cn/约7.38.htm">38</a>）<br />在这些经文中，“渴”表示渴望真理；“喝”表示接受教导；“活水的江河”表示唯独从主流出的神性真理。<br />以赛亚书：<br />提玛地的居民哪，拿水来迎口渴的，拿饼来接逃亡的。（以赛亚书<a href="http://39-27.cn/赛21.14.htm">21:14</a>）<br />“拿水来迎口渴的”表示在真理上教导渴望真理的人，从而使其灵魂的生命焕发活力。同一先知书：<br />愚顽人必说愚顽话，心里想作罪孽，行虚伪的事，说错谬的话攻击耶和华，使饥饿人的灵魂空虚，使口渴的人无所可喝。（以赛亚书<a href="http://39-27.cn/赛32.6.htm">32:6</a>）<br />“饥饿的人”表示渴望良善的人；“口渴的人”表示渴望真理的人。<br /><br />困苦穷乏人寻求水却没有，他们因口渴，舌头干燥。我要在山坡上开江河，在山谷中间开泉源；我要使旷野变为水池，使干地变为水泉。（以赛亚书<a href="http://39-27.cn/赛41.17.htm">41:17</a>，<a href="http://39-27.cn/赛41.18.htm">18</a>）<br />谁都能明显看出，“寻求水”是指寻求真理；“因口渴干燥”是指因缺乏真理而被剥夺属灵生命；“江河”、“泉源”、“水池”、“水泉”是指信之真理，他们将要在信之真理上接受教导。<br />你们说，耶和华救赎了他的仆人雅各！那时，他们并不干渴；祂要引导他们经过荒野；祂要为他们使水从磐石流出，分裂磐石，水就涌出。（以赛亚书<a href="http://39-27.cn/赛48.20.htm">48:20</a>，<a href="http://39-27.cn/赛48.21.htm">21</a>）<br />“他们并不干渴”表示他们不缺乏真理；“水”在此明显表示信之真理。<br />他们不饥不渴，炎热和烈日必不伤害他们，因为怜恤他们的，必引导他们，领他们到水泉旁边。（以赛亚书<a href="http://39-27.cn/赛49.10.htm">49:10</a>）<br />“他们不饥”表示他们不缺乏良善；“不渴”表示他们不缺乏真理；“水泉”表示出于圣言的真理的知识或认知。<br />类似的话出现在摩西五经中：<br />耶和华引你经过那大而可怕的旷野，有大蛇、火蛇、蝎子、干旱无水之地。祂曾为你使水从峭壁之石中流出来。（申命记<a href="http://39-27.cn/申8.15.htm">8:15</a>）<br />以赛亚书：<br />看哪！你们的神必来；那时，在旷野必有水喷出，在沙漠平原必有河涌流。干地要变为水池，干渴之地要变为水泉。（以赛亚书<a href="http://39-27.cn/赛35.4.htm">35:4</a>，<a href="http://39-27.cn/赛35.6.htm">6</a>，<a href="http://39-27.cn/赛35.7.htm">7</a>）<br />“在旷野必有水喷出”、“河”、“水池”和“水泉”明显表示信之真理和对这些真理的认知，当主降世时，它们要从祂那里被赐予。<br />诗篇：<br />神啊，我的神！我早晨寻求你；在干旱疲乏无水之地，我的灵魂渴求你，我的肉身切慕你。（诗篇<a href="http://39-27.cn/诗63.1.htm">63:1</a>）<br />此处“渴求”论及真理；“疲乏无水”表示没有真理。在以赛亚书，“干渴”表示真理的缺乏和由此导致的属灵生命的剥夺：<br />所以我的百姓因无知而流亡。他们的尊贵人甚是饥饿，他们的群众极其干渴。（以赛亚书<a href="http://39-27.cn/赛5.13.htm">5:13</a>）<br /><br />我使江河变为旷野，其中的鱼因无水腥臭，干渴而死。（以赛亚书<a href="http://39-27.cn/赛50.2.htm">50:2</a>）<br />从这些经文可以看出来，在本章，“百姓没有水喝”（17:1），他们说“给我们水喝”（17:2）、“百姓甚渴，要喝水”（17:3）、“必有水从磐石里出来”（17:6）分别表示什么。这一切清楚表明，他们因缺水而发怨言表示由于真理的缺乏而产生的试探。因为当一个人由于缺乏真理而进入试探时，他就被保持在对它的强烈渴望中，同时被保持在因此而对永恒救赎的绝望中。这些感觉造成那时的痛苦和抱怨。</p>

<p align="center"><b>Potts(1905-1910) 8568</b></p><p><b>8568.</b>
And the people thirsted there for the waters. That this signifies an increase of longing for truth, is evident from the signification of "thirsting," as being to strive after and long for, and as being 
predicated of truth, as "hungering" is predicated of good; and from the signification of "water," as being the truth of faith (see n. 8562). That "to thirst" denotes to strive after and long for the 
truth which is signified by "water," is very plain from many passages in the Word, as in Amos: </p>
<p>     Behold the days come wherein I will send a famine into the land, not a famine for bread, nor a thirst 
for waters, but for hearing the words of Jehovah; and they shall wander from sea to sea, and from the north even to the east; they shall run to and fro to seek the word of Jehovah, and shall not 
find it; in that day shall the beautiful virgins and the young men faint with thirst (Amos 8:11-13). A longing to know truth is here described by "thirsting;" the longing for truth is signified by "I 
will not send a thirst for waters, but for hearing the words of Jehovah;" the lack of truth and the consequent privation of spiritual life are described by, "in that day shall the beautiful virgins and 
the young men faint with thirst;" "beautiful virgins" denote those who are in affections of good, and "young men" those who are in affections of truth. [2] In Isaiah: </p>
<p>     Ho, everyone that thirsteth, 
come ye to the waters, and he that hath no silver; come ye, buy, eat, come ye and buy wine and milk without silver and without price (Isa. 55:1). "Everyone that thirsteth, come ye to the waters," 
manifestly denotes one who longs for the truths of faith; "to buy wine and milk without price" denotes to procure the truth and good of faith for themselves from the Lord, thus gratuitously (that "waters" 
denote the truth of faith, see n. 8562; that "wine" denotes the good of faith, n. 6377, and also "milk," n. 2184). Everyone can see that by "coming to the waters and buying wine and milk," is 
not here meant wine and milk, but such things as are of heaven and the church. [3] In like manner in John: </p>
<p>     I will give to him that is athirst of the fountain of the water of life free (Rev. 21:6); </p>
<p>where 
"the fountain of the water of life" denotes the truth and good of faith; "he that is athirst" denotes one who longs from affection, according to the Lord's words in John: </p>
<p>     Jesus said to 
the woman of Samaria, Everyone that drinketh of this water shall thirst again: but he that drinketh of the water that I shall give him shall never thirst; but the water that I shall give him shall become 
in him a fountain of water springing up into eternal life (John 4:13, 14). Here "water" plainly denotes the truth of faith from the Word, thus from the Lord; "never thirsting" here denotes that 
truth shall no longer fail him. [4] In like manner elsewhere in John: </p>
<p>     Jesus said, I am the bread of life; he that cometh to Me shall never hunger, and he that believeth in Me shall never thirst 
(John 6:35).      Jesus cried, saying, If anyone thirst, let him come unto Me, and drink; whosoever believeth in Me, as the Scripture hath said, Out of his belly shall flow streams of living water 
(John 7:37, 38). In these passages "to thirst" denotes to long for truth; "to drink" denotes to be instructed; "streams of living water" denote Divine truth, which is from the Lord alone. [5] In Isaiah: </p>
<p> 
    Bring ye waters to meet him that is thirsty; O ye inhabitants of the land of Tema, come before the wanderer with his bread (Isa. 21:14); </p>
<p>where "bringing waters to meet him that is thirsty" 
denotes instructing in truths him who longs for them, and thus refreshing the life of his soul. In the same: </p>
<p>     The fool will speak folly, and his heart will do iniquity, to do hypocrisy, and to utter 
error against Jehovah, to make empty the soul of the hungry one, and he will make the drink of the thirsty one to fail (Isa 32:0); </p>
<p>"the hungry one" denotes him who longs for good; and "he that thirsteth 
for drink," him who longs for truth.  [6] Again: </p>
<p>     The poor and needy seek water but there is none, and their tongue faileth for thirst; I will open rivers upon the hillsides, and I will 
put fountains in the midst of the valleys, the wilderness for a pool of waters, and the dry land for springs of  waters (Isa. 41:17, 18); </p>
<p>everyone can plainly see that "seeking water" denotes seeking 
truth; that "failing for thirst" denotes being deprived of spiritual life from a lack of truth; that "rivers," "fountains," "a pool," and "springs of waters" denote the truths of faith in which they 
were to be instructed.  [7] Again: </p>
<p>     Say ye, Jehovah hath redeemed his servant Jacob; then shall they not thirst, He shall lead them in the wastes; He shall cause the waters to flow out of the rock 
for them, and He will cleave the rock that the waters may flow out (Isa. 48:20, 21); </p>
<p> "they shall not thirst" denotes that truths shall not fail them; "waters" here manifestly denote the truths of 
faith. Again: </p>
<p>     They shall not hunger nor thirst; neither shall the heat nor the sun smite them; for He that hath mercy on them shall lead them, so that even upon the springs of waters He will lead 
them (Isa. 49:10); </p>
<p>"they shall not hunger" denotes that good shall not fail them; "they shall not thirst" denotes that truth shall not fail them; "springs of waters" denote the knowledges of truth 
from the Word.  [8] In like manner in Moses: </p>
<p>     Jehovah leadeth thee through the great and fearful wilderness, of the serpent, of the fire-serpent, and of the scorpion, and of thirst, where are 
no waters; who bringeth forth for thee waters out of the stone of the crag (Deut. 8:15). Again in Isaiah: </p>
<p>     Behold your God will come; then in the wilderness shall waters break out, and rivers in 
the plain of the desert; and the dry place shall become a pool, and the thirsty one for springs of waters (Isa. 35:4, 6, 7); </p>
<p>"the waters in the wilderness that shall break out," "rivers," "a pool," "springs 
of waters," plainly denote the truths of faith and the knowledges of them, which would be given from the Lord when He should come into the world.  [9] In David: </p>
<p>     O God, my God, in the morning 
do I seek Thee; my soul thirsteth for Thee, my flesh longeth for Thee, in a land of drought, and weary without waters (Ps. 68:1); </p>
<p>where "thirsting" is predicated of truth; "weary without waters" 
denotes that there are no truths. "Thirst" denotes a lack of truth and the consequent privation of spiritual life, in Isaiah: </p>
<p>     Therefore My people will go into exile, for not acknowledging, and 
their glory are men of famine, and their multitude are parched with thirst (Isa. 5:13).      I make the rivers a wilderness: their fish stinketh because there is no water, and dieth for thirst (Isa. 
50:2). [10] From these passages it can now be seen what is signified in this chapter by there being "no water for the people to drink" (verse 1); by their saying, "Give us water and we will drink" (verse 
2); by "the people thirsting there for waters" (verse 3); by that "there shall come waters out of the rock" (verse 6). Consequently by their murmuring on account of the lack of water is signified 
temptation from the lack of truth; for when a man comes into temptation from the lack of truth, he is kept in a vehement longing for it, and at the same time in despair of eternal salvation on this 
account: these things then cause suffering, and complaint. </p>

<p align="center"><b>Elliott(1983-1999) 8568</b></p><p><b>8568.</b>
'And the people thirsted there for water' means an increase in the desire for truth. This is clear from the meaning of 'thirsting' as craving and desiring, and as having reference to truth just as 'hungering' 
has reference to good; and from the meaning of 'water' as the truth of faith, dealt with above in <a href="8562.htm">8562</a>. The fact that 'thirsting' is craving and desiring - desiring truth, meant by 'water' - 
is plainly evident from a large number of places in the Word, such as in Amos, </p>
<blockquote>
Behold, the days are going to come, in which I will send a famine on the land, not a famine of bread, nor a thirst for 
water, but for hearing the words of Jehovah. And they will wander from sea to sea, and from the north even to the east; and they will run to and fro to seek the Word of Jehovah, and will not find it. 
On that day the beautiful virgins and the young men will faint for thirst. <a href="http://bible.gospelcom.net/cgi-bin/bible?passage=Amos%208:11-13&amp;version=ESV&amp;interface=print&amp;showfn=yes&amp;showxref">Amos 8:11-13</a>. 
</blockquote>
<p>The desire to know the truth is described here by 'thirsting'. The desire for truth is meant by 'I will not 
send a thirst for water, but for hearing the words of Jehovah' and by 'they will run to and fro to seek the Word of Jehovah'. The lack of truth and a resulting deprivation of spiritual life is described 
by 'on that day the beautiful virgins and the young men will faint for thirst', 'the beautiful virgins' being those with affections for good, and 'the young men' those with affections for truth. </p>
<p></p>
<p><b>[2]</b>
In Isaiah, </p>
<blockquote>
Ho, everyone who thirsts, come to the waters; and he who has no money, come, buy [and] eat! Come and buy wine and milk without money and without price. <a href="http://bible.gospelcom.net/cgi-bin/bible?passage=Isa%2055:1&amp;version=ESV&amp;interface=print&amp;showfn=yes&amp;showxref">Isa 55:1</a>. 
</blockquote>
<p>'Everyone who 
thirsts, come to the waters' plainly stands for one desiring the truths of faith. 'Buying wine and milk without price' stands for acquiring from the Lord, thus for nothing, the good and truth of faith. 
For the meaning of 'the waters' as the truth of faith, see above in <a href="8562.htm">8562</a>; for 'wine' as the good of faith, <a href="6377.htm">6377</a>; and also 'milk', <a href="2184.htm">2184</a>. Anyone may see that 'going to the waters and buying wine and 
milk' is not used to mean the acquisition of wine and milk, but the kinds of things that belong to heaven and the Church.  </p>
<p></p>
<p><b>[3]</b>
 The like occurs in John, </p>
<blockquote>
To him who thirsts I will give from the spring 
of the water of life for nothing. <a href="http://bible.gospelcom.net/cgi-bin/bible?passage=Rev%2021:6&amp;version=ESV&amp;interface=print&amp;showfn=yes&amp;showxref">Rev 21:6</a>. 
</blockquote>
<p>'The spring of the water of life' stands for the truth and good of faith. 'The thirsting one' stands for one desiring them from affection for them, 
as accords with the Lord's words in John, </p>
<blockquote>
Jesus said to the Samaritan woman, Everyone who drinks of this water will thirst again, but he who drinks of the water that I shall give him will never thirst. 
But the water that I shall give will become in him a spring of water welling up into eternal life. <a href="http://bible.gospelcom.net/cgi-bin/bible?passage=John%204:13,%2014&amp;version=ESV&amp;interface=print&amp;showfn=yes&amp;showxref">John 4:13, 14</a>. 
</blockquote>
<p>'Water' here plainly stands for the truth of faith obtained from the Word, and 
so from the Lord; and 'not thirsting' stands for his being never again in want of truth. </p>
<p></p>
<p><b>[4]</b>
 Something similar appears elsewhere in John, </p>
<blockquote>
Jesus said, I am the bread of life; he who comes to Me 
will not hunger, and he who believes in Me will never thirst. <a href="http://bible.gospelcom.net/cgi-bin/bible?passage=John%206:35&amp;version=ESV&amp;interface=print&amp;showfn=yes&amp;showxref">John 6:35</a>. 
</blockquote>
<p>And in the same gospel, </p>
<blockquote>
Jesus cried out, saying, If anyone thirsts let him come to Me and drink. Whoever believes in Me, 
as the Scripture has said, Out of his belly will flow rivers of living water. <a href="http://bible.gospelcom.net/cgi-bin/bible?passage=John%207:37,%2038&amp;version=ESV&amp;interface=print&amp;showfn=yes&amp;showxref">John 7:37, 38</a>. 
</blockquote>
<p>'Thirsting stands for desiring truth, 'drinking for receiving instruction, and 'rivers of living water' 
for Divine Truth that flows from the Lord alone.  </p>
<p></p>
<p><b>[5]</b>
 In Isaiah, </p>
<blockquote>
To the thirsty bring water, O inhabitants of the land of Tema; meet with his bread the fugitive. <a href="http://bible.gospelcom.net/cgi-bin/bible?passage=Isa%2021:14&amp;version=ESV&amp;interface=print&amp;showfn=yes&amp;showxref">Isa 21:14</a>. 
</blockquote>
<p>'To the thirsty 
bring water' stands for giving instruction in truths to one desiring them, and so refreshing the life of his soul. In the same prophet, </p>
<blockquote>
The fool will speak folly, and his heart will work iniquity, 
to practice hypocrisy, and to utter error against Jehovah; to empty the soul of the hungry one, and to cause the drink of the thirsting one to fail. <a href="http://bible.gospelcom.net/cgi-bin/bible?passage=Isa%2032:6&amp;version=ESV&amp;interface=print&amp;showfn=yes&amp;showxref">Isa 32:6</a>. 
</blockquote>
<p>'The hungry one' stands for one desiring 
good, and 'one thirsting for drink' for one desiring truth. </p>
<p></p>
<p><b>[6]</b>
 In the same prophet, </p>
<blockquote>
The poor and the needy are seeking water, but there is none; their tongue is parched with thirst. I will open 
streams on the sloping heights, and I will place springs in the midst of valleys; I will make the wilderness into a pool of water, and the dry land into wellsprings of water. <a href="http://bible.gospelcom.net/cgi-bin/bible?passage=Isa%2041:17,18&amp;version=ESV&amp;interface=print&amp;showfn=yes&amp;showxref">Isa 41:17,18</a>. 
</blockquote>
<p>It 
is perfectly clear to anyone that 'seeking water' is seeking truth, that 'being parched with thirst' is being deprived of spiritual life owing to the lack of truth, and that 'streams, springs, a pool, 
and wellsprings of water' are the truths of faith in which they are to receive instruction. </p>
<p>In the same prophet, </p>
<blockquote>
Say, Jehovah has redeemed His servant Jacob. At that time they will not thirst; 
in waste places He will lead them. He will make water flow for them from the rock; and He will cleave the rock so that water flows out. <a href="http://bible.gospelcom.net/cgi-bin/bible?passage=Isa%2048:20,%2021&amp;version=ESV&amp;interface=print&amp;showfn=yes&amp;showxref">Isa 48:20, 21</a>. 
</blockquote>
<p>'They will not thirst' stands for their having 
no lack of truths; here 'water' plainly stands for the truths of faith.  </p>
<p></p>
<p><b>[7]</b>
 In the same prophet, </p>
<blockquote>
They will not hunger, nor will they thirst, nor will heat or the sun strike them; for the 
One having mercy on them will lead them, so that also by the wellsprings of water He will lead them. <a href="http://bible.gospelcom.net/cgi-bin/bible?passage=Isa%2049:10&amp;version=ESV&amp;interface=print&amp;showfn=yes&amp;showxref">Isa 49:10</a>. 
</blockquote>
<p>'They will not hunger' stands for their having no lack of good, 'they will not thirst' 
for their having no lack of truth. 'Wellsprings of water' stands for cognitions of truth out of the Word. </p>
<p></p>
<p><b>[8]</b>
 Something similar occurs in Moses, </p>
<blockquote>
Jehovah was leading you through a great and 
frightening wilderness, with serpents, fiery snakes, and scorpions, and dry places where there was no water; and He brought water for you out of the rock of the crag. <a href="http://bible.gospelcom.net/cgi-bin/bible?passage=Deut%208:15&amp;version=ESV&amp;interface=print&amp;showfn=yes&amp;showxref">Deut 8:15</a>. 
</blockquote>
<p>In Isaiah, </p>
<blockquote>
Behold, 
your God will come. At that time waters will break forth in the wilderness, and streams in the plain of the wilderness; and the dry place will become a pool and the thirsty ground wellsprings of 
water. <a href="http://bible.gospelcom.net/cgi-bin/bible?passage=Isa%2035:4,%206,%207&amp;version=ESV&amp;interface=print&amp;showfn=yes&amp;showxref">Isa 35:4, 6, 7</a>. 
</blockquote>
<p>'Waters in the wilderness which will break forth', 'streams', 'a pool', and 'wellsprings of water' plainly stand for the truths of faith and cognitions of those truths, which 
would be received from the Lord when He came into the world. </p>
<p></p>
<p><b>[9]</b>
 In David, </p>
<blockquote>
O God, [You are] my God; in the morning I seek You. My soul thirsts for You; my flesh in a dry land longs for You, and 
I am weary without water. <a href="http://bible.gospelcom.net/cgi-bin/bible?passage=Ps%2063:1&amp;version=ESV&amp;interface=print&amp;showfn=yes&amp;showxref">Ps 63:1</a>. 
</blockquote>
<p>Here 'thirsting' has reference to truth, and 'I am weary without water' stands for the fact that there are no truths. 'Thirst' stands for a lack of truth and 
the resulting deprivation of spiritual life in Isaiah, </p>
<blockquote>
Therefore My people will go into exile because they have no knowledge, and their honourable men will be famished,<A name="fntext1"></a><A href="#fn1"><sup>a</sup></a> and their multitude parched 
with thirst. <a href="http://bible.gospelcom.net/cgi-bin/bible?passage=Isa%205:13&amp;version=ESV&amp;interface=print&amp;showfn=yes&amp;showxref">Isa 5:13</a>. 
</blockquote>
<p>In the same prophet, </p>
<blockquote>
I make the rivers into a desert; their fish become putrid because there is no water, and they will die of thirst. <a href="http://bible.gospelcom.net/cgi-bin/bible?passage=Isa%2050:2&amp;version=ESV&amp;interface=print&amp;showfn=yes&amp;showxref">Isa 50:2</a>. 
</blockquote>
<p></p>
<p><b>[10]</b>
 From all this one 
may now see what is meant in the present chapter by there was no water for the people to drink, verse 1; by their saying, Give us water and let us drink, verse 2; by the people thirsted there for water, 
verse 3; and by the declaration that water would come out of the rock, verse 6. All of this makes it clear that their grumbling because of the lack of water means temptation arising from a lack 
of truth. For when a person enters temptation because of a lack of truth he is gripped by an intense desire for it, and at the same time by despair of eternal salvation on account of this. These feelings 
are responsible for the grief at that time and for the complaining.

`Et sitivit ibi populus aquas': quod significet increscentiam desiderii ad verum, constat ex significatione `sitire' quod sit appetere et desiderare, et quod praedicetur de vero, sicut `esurire' de 
bono, et ex significatione `aquae' quod sit verum fidei, de qua supra n. 8562; quod `sitire' sit appetere et desiderare, nempe verum, quod significatur per `aquam,' patet manifeste ex pluribus locis in 
Verbo, ut apud Amos, Ecce dies venturi, quibus immittam famem in terram, non famem ad panem, neque sitim ad aquas, sed ad audiendum verba Jehovae; et vagabuntur a mari ad mare, et a septentrione usque 
ad orientem; et discursitabunt ad quaerendum verbum Jehovae, nec invenient; in die illo deficient virgines pulchrae et juvenes siti, viii 11-13; </p>
<p>desiderium sciendi verum describitur hic per `sitire'; 
desiderium ad verum significatur per `immittam non sitim ad aquas, sed ad audiendum verba Jehovae' et per `discursitabunt ad quaerendum verbum Jehovae; defectus veri et inde privatio vitae spiritualis 
describitur per `in die illo deficient virgines pulchrae et juvenes siti'; `virgines pulchrae' sunt qui in affectionibus boni, et `juvenes' qui in affectionibus veri: apud 2 Esaiam, Heu, omnis 
sitiens, ite ad aquas, et cui non argentum, ite, emite, comedite, ite et emite sine argento et sine pretio vinum et lac, lv (x)1; </p>
<p>`omnis sitiens, ite ad aquas' manifeste pro desiderante vera fidei, `emere 
sine pretio vinum et lac' pro comparare sibi a Domino, ita gratis {1}verum et bonum fidei; quod `aquae' sint verum fidei, videatur supra n. 8562, quod `vinum' sit (d)bonum fidei, {2} n. 6377, {3}et 
quoque `lac,' n. 2184; quod hic per `ire ad aquas, et emere vinum et lac' non vinum et lac intelligantur, sed talia quae sunt caeli et Ecclesiae, cuivis potest constare: pariter apud Johannem, 3 Ego 
sitienti dabo ex fonte aquae vitae gratis, Apoc xxi 6; </p>
<p>`fons aquae vitae' pro vero et bono fidei {4}: `sitiens' pro desiderante ex affectione, secundum Domini verba apud Johannem, Jesus dixit mulieri 
Samaritidi, Omnis qui bibit ex aqua hac sitiet iterum; qui vero bibit ex aqua quam Ego dabo ei non sitiet in aeternum, sed aqua quam Ego dabo fiet in eo fons (x)aquae salientis in vitam aeternam, 
iv 13, 14; </p>
<p>`aqua' hic manifeste pro vero fidei (c)e Verbo, ita a Domino, `non 4 sitire' hic pro quod non {5}amplius deficiet ei verum: similiter alibi apud Johannem, Jesus dixit, Ego sum panis vitae; 
qui venit ad Me non esuriet, et qui credit in Me non sitiet in aeternum, vi 35: </p>
<p>et apud eundem, Jesus clamavit dicens, Si quis sitiverit, venito ad Me, et bibito; quisquis credit in Me, sicut dixit 
Scriptura, flumina e ventre illius fluent aquae viventis, vii 37, 38; </p>
<p>`sitire' pro desiderare verum, `bibere' pro instrui, `flumina aquae 5 viventis' pro Divino Vero quod ex Domino solo: apud Esaiam, Obviam 
sitienti adferte aquas, habitatores terrae Thema, cum pane ejus praevenite vagabundum, xxi 14; </p>
<p>`obviam sitienti {6}adferte aquas' pro instruere desiderantem in veris, et sic recreare vitam 
ejus animae: apud eundem, Stultus stultitiam loquetur, et cor illius faciet iniquitatem, ad faciendum hypocrisin, et ad loquendum contra Jehovam errorem, ad evacuandum animam esurientis, et potum 
sitienti deficere faciat, xxxii 6; </p>
<p>`esuriens' pro desiderante bonum, et `potum sitiens' pro desiderante 6 verum: apud eundem, Pauperes et egeni quaerentes aquam, sed non; lingua illorum siti deficit: 
aperiam super clivis fluvios, et in medio vallium fontes ponam, desertum in stagnum aquarum, et terram siccam in scaturigines aquarum, xli 17, 18; </p>
<p>quod `quaerere aquam' sit quaerere verum, quod `deficere 
siti' sit {7}privari vita spirituali ex defectu veri, quod `fluvii, fontes, stagnum, et scaturigines aquarum' sint vera fidei, in quibus {8}instruendi, cuivis 7 evidenter patet: apud eundem, Dicite, 
Redemit Jehovah servum suum Jacobum; tunc non sitient, in vastitatibus ducet illos; aquas e petra effluere faciet illis, et findet petram ut effluant aquae, xlviii 20, 21; </p>
<p>`non {9}sitient' pro 
quod non deficient illis vera, `aquae' hic manifeste pro veris {10} fidei: apud eundem, Non esurient, neque sitient, neque percutiet illos aestus aut sol, nam miserescens illorum ducet illos, ita ut 
etiam super scaturiginibus aquarum ducturus sit illos, xlix 10; </p>
<p>`non {11}esurient' pro quod non deficiet illis bonum, `non {12}sitient' pro quod non deficiet illis verum, `scaturigines aquarum' pro 
cognitionibus veri ex Verbo: similiter apud Moschen, 8 Jehovah ducens te per desertum magnum et formidabile, serpentis, praesteris, et scorpionis, et sitis, ubi non aquae, qui educens tibi aquas e petra 
scopuli, Deut. viii 15: </p>
<p>apud Esaiam, Ecce Deus vester veniet, tunc erumpent in deserto aquae, et fluvii in planitie deserti; et erit aridus locus in stagnum et siticulosus in scaturigines aquarum, 
xxxv 4, 6, 7; </p>
<p>`aquae in deserto, quae erumpent, fluvii, stagnum, scaturigines aquarum' manifeste pro veris fidei et cognitionibus illorum, quae a Domino cum venturus in mundum: apud Davidem, 9 Deus, 
Deus meus, mane quaero Te, sitit anima mea Te, desiderat Te caro mea, in terra siccitatis, et lassus sine aquis, Ps. lxiii 2 [A.V. 1]; </p>
<p>ibi `sitire' praedicatur de vero, `lassus sine aquis' pro quod 
non vera: `sitis' pro defectu veri et inde privatione vitae spiritualis, apud Esaiam, Propterea exulabit populus Meus ob non agnitionem, et gloria ejus (x)homines famis, et multitudo ejus sicca siti, 
v 13: </p>
<p>{13} apud eundem, Pono fluvios in desertum, putrescit piscis illorum, eo quod non aqua, et morietur siti, l 2. 	10 Ex his nunc constare potest quid significatur in hoc capite per quod nulla 
aqua ad bibendum populo, vers. 1; per quod dicerent, Date nobis aquam et bibamus, vers. 2; per sitivit ibi populus aquas, vers. 3; quod exirent e petra aquae, vers. 6; consequenter quod per `murmurationem 
illorum propter defectum aquae' significetur tentatio ex defectu veri; cum enim homo in tentationem venit {14}ex defectu veri, tunc tenetur vehementer in desiderio ejus, et simul in desperatione 
de salute aeterna propterea; haec faciunt indolentiam tunc et querimoniam. 	@1 verum boni$ 	@2 i videatur$ 	@3 et quoque lac bonum fidei ex charitate but d quoque and bonum fidei$ 	@4 i quae homini
