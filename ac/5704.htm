<h3 align="center" class="ired">属天的奥秘 第5704节</h3>
<h4 align="center"></h4><p><strong>5704.</strong>“头生的照着长子的名分，最小的照着他的年幼”表符合真理在良善之下所取的次序。这从“头生的照着长子的名分，最小的照着他的年幼（就）坐”的含义清楚可知，“头生的照着长子的名分，最小的照着他的年幼（就）坐”是指符合真理在良善之下所取的次序。以色列的儿子们代表以自己的适当次序存在的教会真理（参看创世记29至30章的解读）；因此，按他们的出生次序就坐表示符合真理所取的次序。但是，以色列的儿子们所代表的教会真理若不通过基督教徒的良善，也就是通过对邻之仁和对主之爱的良善，就不会进入任何次序。因为良善有主在里面，因而有天堂在里面。因此，良善有生命，因而有活跃的积极力量在里面。但没有良善的真理绝无可能拥有任何生命在里面。良善照自己的样式按次序排列真理，这从每一种爱，甚至从自我之爱和尘世之爱，因而从对报复、仇恨和类似邪恶的爱那里很明显地看出来。陷入这些邪恶的人称邪恶为良善，因为他们以邪恶为快乐。他们的这所谓良善按次序排列在他们看来是真理的虚假，好叫这些虚假支持它，直到最后他们称之为真理的所有这些虚假被排列成一种次序，该次序就变成一系列的虚假信仰。但这种次序是诸如存在于地狱中的那种次序；而天堂之爱之下真理的次序则是诸如存在于天堂中的那种次序。这也解释了为何拥有后一种次序在里面的人，也就是已经重生的人被称为小天堂，而且是最小形式的天堂；因为他的内层对应于天堂。<br />正是良善给真理带来次序，这一事实从存在于天堂中的次序明显看出来。在那里，所有社群都是照着在来自主的良善之下的真理所在的次序被排列。因为就主自己的存在而言，祂无非是神性良善；而神性真理并不在主里面，只是从主发出；天堂的所有社群都是照着神性良善之下的神性真理按次序被排列，或说被排列成次序。至于主无非是神性良善，神性真理并不在祂里面，只是从祂发出，这一点可通过对比这个世界的太阳来说明。这太阳无非是火，光并不在它里面，只是从它发出。而且，依赖于光的这个世界的事物，如植物，是被从太阳之火发出，并存在于阳光里面的热按次序排列的，这从春夏时节明显看出来。由于整个自然界是代表主国度的一个舞台，所以涉及太阳的整个情形也具有如此的代表性。太阳代表主；它的火代表主的神性之爱；它的热代表从这爱流出的良善，它的光代表构成信的真理。由于它们是这些代表，故在圣言中，就灵义而言，“太阳”表示主（参看<a href="1053.htm">1053</a>，<a href="1521.htm">1521</a>，<a href="1529.htm">1529</a>-<a href="1531.htm">1531</a>，<a href="3636.htm">3636</a>，<a href="3643.htm">3643</a>，<a href="4321.htm">4321</a>，<a href="5097.htm">5097</a>，<a href="5377.htm">5377</a>节），“火”表示爱（<a href="934.htm">934</a>，<a href="4906.htm">4906</a>，<a href="5071.htm">5071</a>，<a href="5215.htm">5215</a>节）；因此，太阳的火在代表意义上是指神性之爱，而从这火发出的热是指从神性之爱流出的良善。“光”表示真理（参看<a href="2776.htm">2776</a>，<a href="3138.htm">3138</a>，<a href="3190.htm">3190</a>，<a href="3195.htm">3195</a>，<a href="3222.htm">3222</a>，<a href="3339.htm">3339</a>，<a href="3636.htm">3636</a>，<a href="3643.htm">3643</a>，<a href="3862.htm">3862</a>，<a href="3993.htm">3993</a>，<a href="4302.htm">4302</a>，<a href="4409.htm">4409</a>，<a href="4413.htm">4413</a>，<a href="4415.htm">4415</a>，<a href="4526.htm">4526</a>，<a href="5219.htm">5219</a>，<a href="5400.htm">5400</a>节）。</p>

The firstborn according to his birthright, and the youngest according to his youth. That this signifies according to the order of truths under good, is evident from the signification of "sitting according 
to birthright and according to youth," as being according to the order of truths under good; for the sons of Israel represent the truths of the church in their order (see the explication of the 
twenty-ninth and thirtieth chapters of Genesis); and therefore to sit "according to their birth" is according to the order of truths. But the truths of the church which the sons of Israel represent do 
not come into any order except through Christian good, that is, through the good of charity toward the neighbor and of love to the Lord; for in good there is the Lord, and hence in good there is heaven; 
consequently in good there is life, thus living active force; but never in truth without good. That good sets truths in order after its own likeness is very manifest from every love, even from the 
loves of self and of the world, thus from the love of revenge, of hatred, and of the like evils. They who are in these evils call evil good, because to them evil is delightful. This so-called good of 
theirs sets in order the falsities which to them are truths, so that they may favor it, and at last sets all these falsities which they call truths in such an order as to effect persuasion. But this 
order is such as is the order in hell; whereas the order of truths under the good of celestial love is such as is the order in the heavens; and from this the man who has such order within him, that is, 
who has been regenerated, is called a little heaven, and moreover is a heaven in the least form, for his interiors correspond to the heavens.  [2] That it is good which sets truths in order is evident 
from the order in the heavens. There all the societies are set in order according to the truths under good which are from the Lord; for the Lord is nothing but Divine good; Divine truth is not in 
the Lord, but proceeds from Him; and according to this Divine truth under Divine good are all the societies in the heavens set in order. That the Lord is nothing but Divine good, and that Divine truth 
is not in Him, but proceeds from Him, may be illustrated by comparison with the sun of the world. The sun is nothing but fire, and light is not in it, but proceeds from it; and likewise the things that 
are of light in the world, such as vegetable forms, are set in order by the heat which proceeds from the sun's fire and is in its light, as is evident in the time of spring and summer. As universal 
nature is a theater representative of the Lord's kingdom, so also is this universal. The sun represents the Lord, the fire of it His Divine love, and the heat from it the good which flows therefrom, 
and the light the truths which are of faith; and because they are representative, therefore in the Word in the spiritual sense by the "sun" is meant the Lord (see n. 1053, 1521, 1529-1531, 3636, 3643, 
4321, 5097, 5377), and by "fire" love (n. 934, 4906, 5071, 5215); thus the sun's fire is representatively the Divine love, and the heat from it is good from the Divine love. (That light represents truth 
may be seen above, n. 2776, 3138, 3190, 3195, 3222, 3339, 3636, 3643, 3862, 3993, 4302, 4409, 4413, 4415, 4526, 5219, 5400.) </p>

'The firstborn according to his birthright, and the youngest according to his youth' means in conformity with the order truths take beneath good. This is clear from the meaning of 'taking seats according 
to birthright, and according to youth' as in conformity with the order truths take beneath good. The sons of Israel represent the truths known to the Church existing in their proper order, see the 
explanation at Chapters <a href="29.htm">29</a> and <a href="30.htm">30</a> of Genesis, and therefore taking their seats according to their order of birth means in conformity with the order truths take. But the truths known to the Church, which 
'the sons of Israel' represent, do not come to be arranged into any kind of proper order except through Christian good, that is, through the good of charity towards the neighbour and of love to the 
Lord. For good has the Lord within it, and therefore has heaven within it. Good consequently has life within it, making it a force that is active and filled with life. But truth devoid of good cannot 
possibly have any life within it Good arranges truths into order in keeping with itself, as is quite evident from every kind of love, including self-love and love of the world, and so such love as 
gives rise to vengeance, hatred, and other evils like these. People governed by those loves call evil good because they take delight in evil This so-called good of theirs imposes a certain kind of order 
on those falsities which to them are truths - a kind of order that enables these falsities to lend support to it, till at length all those falsities, which they call truths, are arranged into an order 
that becomes a sequence of false beliefs. But this order is the kind of order that exists in hell, whereas the order in which truths are ranged beneath the good of heavenly love is the kind that exists 
in heaven. This also explains why a person with whom the latter kind of order resides, that is, a person who has been regenerated, is called a miniature heaven and also is heaven in the smallest 
form of all that it can take; for his interiors correspond to the heavens.  </p>
<p></p>
<p><b>[2]</b>
 The fact that good is what brings order to truths is evident from order as it exists in the heavens. All the communities 
there are ranged in conformity with the order in which truths that are received from the Lord exist beneath good. For [in His own Being] the Lord is nothing else than Divine Good, while Divine Truth, 
which does not exist within Him, goes forth from Him. And it is in conformity with this Divine Truth ranged beneath Divine Good that all the communities of heaven have been arranged into order. As 
regards the Lord's being nothing else than Divine Love whereas Divine Truth does not exist within Him but goes forth from Him, this can be illustrated by a comparison made with the sun of this world. 
The sun is nothing else than fire, while its light does not exist within it but goes forth from it. What is more, objects in the world dependent on light, such as plants, are subject to the order imparted 
to them by the heat that goes forth from the fire of the sun and exists within the light of the sun, as is evident in springtime and summertime. For since the Whole natural order is a theatre representative 
of the Lord's kingdom, so is this whole situation involving the sun representative. The sun represents the Lord; its fire represents His Divine Love; the heat from it represents the good 
that flows from this Love, and its light the truths that constitute faith. And since they have these representations, 'the sun' is also used in the spiritual sense of the Word to mean the Lord, <a href="1053.htm">1053</a>, <a href="1521.htm">1521</a>, <a href="1529.htm">1529</a>-<a href="1531.htm">1531</a>, <a href="3636.htm">3636</a>, <a href="3643.htm">3643</a>, <a href="4321.htm">4321</a> (end), <a href="5097.htm">5097</a>, <a href="5377.htm">5377</a>, 'fire' to mean love, <a href="934.htm">934</a>, <a href="4906.htm">4906</a>, <a href="5071.htm">5071</a>, <a href="5215.htm">5215</a>, so that the sun's fire in a representative sense is Divine Love, while the heat from that fire is good 
flowing from Divine love.

`Primogenitus secundum primogenituram suam, et minorennis secundum minorennitatem suam':  quod significet secundum ordinem verorum sub bono, constat ex significatione `consedere secundum primogenituram, 
et secundum minorennitatem' quod sit secundum ordinem verorum sub bono; filii enim Israelis repraesentant vera Ecclesiae in suo ordine, videatur explicatio ad Gen. xxix et xxx; ideo `consedere secundum 
nativitatem eorum' est secundum ordinem verorum; sed vera Ecclesiae, quae `filii Israelis' repraesentant, in nullum ordinem veniunt nisi per bonum {1}Christianum, hoc est, per bonum charitatis 
erga proximum et amoris in Dominum; in bono enim est Dominus, et inde in bono est caelum, consequenter in bono est vita, ita vis agens viva, nusquam autem in vero absque bono; quod bonum {2} ad sui instar 
{3} ordinet vera, {4}patet manifeste ab amore quocumque, etiam ab amoribus {5} sui et mundi, ita ab amore vindictae, odii et similium malorum; qui in illis sunt, vocant malum bonum, quia malum illis 
est jucundum, hoc illorum bonum ita dictum ordinat falsa, quae illis sunt vera, ita ut faveant, et tandem omnia haec, nempe falsa quae vocant vera, in talem ordinem disponit ut fiat persuasio; sed

caelum et quoque est caelum in exiguissima forma, interiora enim ejus correspondent caelis. [2]Quod bonum sit quod ordinat vera, patet ab ordine in caelis; ibi omnes societates dispositae sunt secundum 
vera sub bono quae a Domino; Dominus enim non est nisi quam Divinum Bonum, Divinum autem Verum non est in Domino sed procedit a Domino; secundum Divinum hoc Verum sub Divino Bono ordinatae sunt omnes 
societates in caelis.  Quod Dominus non sit nisi quam Divinum Bonum, et quod Divinum Verum non sit in Ipso sed procedat ab Ipso, illustrari potest comparative a sole mundi; sol non est nisi quam ignis,
