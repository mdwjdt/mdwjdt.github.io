<h3 align="center" class="ired">属天的奥秘 第8867节</h3>
<h4 align="center"></h4><p><strong>8867.</strong>“在我面前，你不可有别的神”表关于真理的思维决不能来自其它任何源头，只能来自主。这从“神”和“面”的含义清楚可知：“神”是指真理，在反面意义上是指虚假（参看<a href="4402.htm">4402</a>，<a href="4544.htm">4544</a>，<a href="7268.htm">7268</a>，<a href="7873.htm">7873</a>，<a href="8301.htm">8301</a>节）；“面”当论及神时，是指爱、怜悯、平安和良善（<a href="222.htm">222</a>，<a href="223.htm">223</a>，<a href="2434.htm">2434</a>，<a href="5585.htm">5585</a>节），因而是指主自己，因为主就是这些所来自的源头。“在我面前，你不可有别的神”之所以表示关于真理的思维决不能来自其它任何源头，只能来自主，还因为经上首先提到的是，“我是耶和华你的神”所表示的主之神性人身，所以这神性人身在次序上占据第一位，必在接下来的每一个真理中普遍掌权（<a href="8864.htm">8864</a>，<a href="8865.htm">8865</a>节）。因此，这条诫命现在宣布了诸如必须要避免的那些事，因为它们具有彻底的毁灭性，会阻止主在从西乃山上所口述和命令的诫命和律例所包含的每一个和一切真理中普遍掌权。具有毁灭性的第一件事就是从某个其它源头，而不是从主思想真理，这由在主面前不可有别的神这一禁令来表示。将会毁灭普遍掌权的这一真理的其它事则包含在依次到来的禁令中，即：不可为自己造雕像；也不可作上天、下地和水中各物的任何形像；不可向它们下拜；也不可事奉它们。故此后经上重复说“因为我是耶和华你的神”，以此表示主必在每一个事物中。</p>

Thou shalt have no other gods before My faces. That this signifies that truths must not be thought of from any other source than the Lord, is evident from the signification of "gods," as being truths, 
and in the opposite sense as being falsities (see n. 4402, 4544, 7268, 7873, 8301); and from the signification of "faces," when predicated of God, as being love, mercy, peace, good (n. 222, 223, 2434, 
5585), thus the Lord Himself, for it is the Lord from whom these are. That "no other gods before My faces" signifies that truths must not be thought of from any other source than the Lord, is also 
because the Divine Human of the Lord, which is signified by "I am Jehovah thy God," is first spoken of, and consequently holds the first place in order, and must universally reign in each of the truths 
that follow (n. 8864, 8865); and therefore there are now perceived such things as must be avoided, because they would destroy and prevent the universal reign of the Lord in all and each of the truths 
contained in the commandments and statutes that were dictated and commanded from Mount Sinai. The first thing which would destroy is the thinking of truths from some other source than the Lord, which 
is signified by the command to have no other gods before the Lord's faces. The rest of the things that would destroy this universal regnant are contained in the things which follow in order, namely, 
that they should not make to themselves a graven image, nor the likeness of anything that is in the heavens, in the earth, or in the waters, and that they should not bow down themselves to them nor serve 
them. After this therefore it again follows "for I am Jehovah thy God," by which is signified that the Lord must be in each and all things. </p>

'You shall not have other gods before My face' means that there must be no thought about truths from any source other than the Lord. This is clear from the meaning of 'gods' as truths, and in the contrary 
sense as falsities, dealt with in <a href="4402.htm">4402</a>, <a href="4544.htm">4544</a>, <a href="7268.htm">7268</a>, <a href="7873.htm">7873</a>, <a href="8301.htm">8301</a>; and from the meaning of 'face', in a reference to God's face, as love, mercy, peace, and goodness, dealt with in <a href="222.htm">222</a>, <a href="223.htm">223</a>, <a href="4311.htm">4311</a>, <a href="5585.htm">5585</a>, 
thus the Lord Himself, since the Lord is the Source from which these spring. The reason why 'there must be no other gods before My face' means that there must be no thought about truths from any 
source other than the Lord is also that the Lord's Divine Human, meant by 'I am Jehovah your God', is mentioned first, which is therefore first in line and must reign universally in each individual truth 
that follows, <a href="8864.htm">8864</a>, <a href="8865.htm">8865</a>. Consequently the commandment now declares such things as are to be avoided because they are thoroughly destructive and prevent the Lord from reigning universally in each 
and every truth contained in the commandments and statutes that were dictated and commanded from Mount Sinai. The first thing that would be destructive is thought about truths from a source other than 
the Lord, which is meant in the words that prohibit the presence of other gods before the Lord's face. All other things which would destroy that truth reigning universally are contained in the prohibitions 
that follow in sequence - that they were not to make a graven image for themselves; that they were not to make any likeness of the things that were in the heavens, on the earth, and in the waters 
and that they were not to bow down to them, and not to serve them. And after these therefore comes the reiteration 'for I am Jehovah your God', meaning that the Lord must be in every single one. </p>

`Non erit tibi dii alii coram faciebus Meis': quod significet quod non cogitandum sit de veris aliunde quam ex Domino, constat ex significatione `deorum' quod sint vera, et in opposito sensu falsa, 
de qua n. 4402, 4544, 7268, 7873, 8301, et ex significatione `facierum' cum praedicantur de Deo, quod sint amor, misericordia, pax, bonum, de qua n. 222, 223, (x)4311, 5585, ita Ipse Dominus, nam Dominus 
est a Quo illa.  Quod `non erunt dii alii coram faciebus Meis' significat quod non cogitandum de veris aliunde quam ex Domino, est quoque quia Divinum Humanum Domini, quod significatur per `Ego Jehovah 
Deus tuus,' primum dicitur et inde primum ordinis tenet, ac universaliter regnabit in {1} singulis veris quae sequuntur, n. 8864, 8865; quare nunc praecipiuntur {2} talia quae evitanda, quia destruunt 
ac deprivant, ne Dominus universaliter regnet in omnibus et singulis veris quae continentur in praeceptis et statutis quae dictata et mandata sunt e monte Sinai; primum quod destrueret {3} est 
si cogitaretur de veris aliunde quam ex Domino, quae significantur per quod `non erunt dii alii coram faciebus Domini'; reliqua quae universale illud regnans destruerent continentur in illis quae ordine 
sequuntur, quod nempe non facerent sibi sculptile, quod nullam similitudinem illorum quae in caelis, quae in terra, et quae in aquis, et quod non incurvarent se illis, et non servirent illis; post
