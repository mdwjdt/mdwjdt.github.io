<h3 align="center" class="ired">属天的奥秘 第5698节</h3>
<h4 align="center"></h4><p><strong>5698.</strong>“说，摆饭”表对通过居间层与属世层中的真理联结的觉知。这从“说”和“摆饭”的含义清楚可知：“说”是指觉知或察觉，如前面频繁所述；“摆饭”是指通过居间层与属世层中的真理联结。摆饭表示实际的一顿饭，饭和筵席表示联结，尤表联结的引入阶段（<a href="3596.htm">3596</a>，<a href="3832.htm">3832</a>，<a href="5161.htm">5161</a>节）。从整个思路可知，它是指通过居间层与属世层中的真理联结，因为“便雅悯”是指居间层，雅各的十个儿子是指属世层中的真理，如前所示。由于联结通过居间层实现，所以一看到便雅悯，约瑟就吩咐他们同他吃饭。当约瑟看见便雅悯与他们同来时，“就对管家的说，将这些人领到屋里，要宰杀牲畜，预备筵席，因为晌午这些人同我吃饭”（创世记<a href="http://39-27.cn/创43.16.htm">43:16</a>）。</p>

And said, Set on bread. That this signifies perception of conjunction through the intermediate with truths in the natural, is evident from the signification of "saying," as being perception (of which 
often above); and from the signification of "setting on bread," as being conjunction through the intermediate with truths in the natural. By the setting on of bread is meant the banquet itself, and by 
banquets and feasts is signified conjunction, specifically initiation to conjunction (n. 3596, 3832, 5161). That it is a conjunction through the intermediate with truths in the natural, follows from 
the series, for "Benjamin" is the intermediate, and the ten sons of Jacob are truths in the natural, as has already been shown; and because the conjunction is through the intermediate, on seeing Benjamin 
Joseph commanded that they should eat with him-"and when Joseph saw Benjamin with them, he said to him that was over his house, Bring the men to the house, and slaying slay, and make ready; for the 
men shall eat with me at noon" (Gen. 43:16). </p>

'And said, Set on bread' means a perception of a joining, through the intermediary, to the truths in the natural. This is clear from the meaning of 'saying' as perceiving, often dealt with already; and 
from the meaning of 'setting on bread' as a joining, through the intermediary, to the truths in the natural. 'Setting on bread' is used to mean an actual meal; and meals and feasts mean a joining together, 
in particular the introductory stage to a joining together, <a href="3596.htm">3596</a>, <a href="3832.htm">3832</a>, <a href="5161.htm">5161</a>. A joining, through the intermediary, to the truths in the natural follows from the train of thought - 'Benjamin' 
being the intermediary, and 'the ten sons of Jacob' the truths in the natural, as shown already. And since the intermediary is the one through whom the joining together is effected, Joseph gave the command, 
on seeing Benjamin, that they should eat with him, </p>
<p>And Joseph saw Benjamin with them, and he said to the one who was over his house, Bring the men to the house, and slaughter and prepare [an 
animal]; for the men will eat with me at midday. Verse 16. </p>

`Et dixit, Ponite panem':  quod significet perceptionem conjunctionis per medium cum veris in naturali, constat ex significatione `dicere' quod sit perceptio, de qua saepius prius; et ex significatione 
`ponere panem' quod sit conjunctio per medium cum veris in naturali; per `ponere panem' intelligitur ipsa comessatio, et per comessationes et {1} convivia significatur conjunctio, in specie initiatio 
ad conjunctionem, n. 3596, 3832, 5161; quod conjunctio per medium cum veris in naturali, sequitur ex serie; `Benjamin' enim est medium, et `decem filii Jacobi' sunt vera in naturali, ut prius est 
ostensum; et quia per medium conjunctio, propter Benjaminem visum, mandatum est a Josepho ut comederent apud illum, 	Et vidit Josephus cum illis Benjaminem, et dixit ei qui super domo sua, Adduc viros 
domum, et mactando macta, et praepara, quia mecum comedent viri in meridie, vers. 16. @1 i per$ </p>
