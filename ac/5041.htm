<h3 align="center" class="ired">属天的奥秘 第5041节</h3>
<h4 align="center"></h4><p><strong>5041.</strong>“但耶和华与约瑟同在”表神性在祂里面，也就是在主里面，“约瑟”在至高意义上代表主；显然，此处所指的是试探中的神性，试探是此处所论述的主题。因为神性本身是耶和华；“耶和华与约瑟同在”表示祂存在或出现在主里面。由于字义论述约瑟，故经上说“与约瑟同在”；但就论述主的内义而言，所指的是“在主里面”。凡在教会的人都能从以下事实看出，神性在主里面，即：主从耶和华成孕；因此，祂经常称耶和华为祂的“父”。人的本质存在，因而其生命的至内层来自父亲；包裹物或外层来自母亲；因此，主的存在，因而其生命的至内层是神性，因为它是耶和华自己；祂通过出生而从母亲那里所取的包裹物或外层构成人身。这人身具有这样的性质：它能经历试探，因为它被来自母亲的遗传之恶玷污了。不过，由于祂的至内层是神性，所以祂能凭自己的能力将来自母亲的这遗传之恶逐出；这种逐出通过试探逐渐进行，直到祂经历终极试探，也就是十字架受难；这时，祂完全荣耀了祂的人身，也就是使它变成神性。由此可见“神性在祂里面”这句话是什么意思。</p>

And Jehovah was with Joseph. That this signifies that the Divine was in Him, that is, in the Lord (who in the supreme sense is represented by Joseph), here the Divine in temptations, which are here treated 
of, is evident; for the Divine Itself is Jehovah; and that He was in the Lord, or within Him, is signified by "Jehovah was with Joseph." As in the sense of the letter Joseph is treated of, it is 
said with him; but in the internal sense, where the Lord is treated of, it is in Him. That the Divine was in Him, may be seen by everyone within the church from the fact that He was conceived of Jehovah, 
for which reason He so frequently calls Him His "Father." The very being of a man, and hence the inmost of his life, is from the father; the clothings or exteriors are from the mother; therefore 
the Lord's being, and hence the inmost of His life, was Divine, because it was Jehovah Himself; and the clothings or exteriors made the human which He took from the mother by birth. This human was such 
that it could be tempted, for it was polluted with hereditary evil from the mother; but because the inmost was Divine, He was able by His own power to cast out that evil heredity from the mother; which 
was done successively by means of temptations, and finally by the last, that of the cross, when He fully glorified His Human, that is, made it Divine. From this it may be seen what is meant by the 
statement that the Divine was in Him. </p>

'And Jehovah was with Joseph' means that the Divine was inwardly present, that is, present within the Lord, who is represented in the highest sense by 'Joseph'. At this point the Divine presence in temptations 
is meant, temptations being the subject here. For the Divine itself is Jehovah, whose existence or presence within the Lord is meant by 'Jehovah was with Joseph'. Because the sense of the letter 
is dealing with Joseph the expression 'with Joseph' is used, but in the internal sense, where the Lord is the subject, 'within the Lord' is meant. Anybody within the Church can recognize this from 
the consideration that the Lord was conceived from Jehovah and for that reason calls Him His Father on so many occasions. A person's essential being (esse) and consequently the inmost centre of life 
in him is received from his father, its coverings or outward clothing from his mother. Therefore the Lord's Essential Being (Esse) and consequently the inmost centre of life in Him was the Divine because 
it was Jehovah Himself, while its coverings or outward clothing constituted the human which He took upon Himself from His mother by being born from her. The nature of this human was such that it 
could undergo temptation, for it was defiled by hereditary evil received from His mother. But because the inmost centre of Him was the Divine, He was able by means of the power that was His own to cast 
out that hereditary evil received from His mother. This casting out took place in succeeding stages by means of temptations, until He underwent the final temptation, that on the Cross, at which point 
He fully glorified His Human, that is, made it Divine. From this one may see what is meant when it is said that the Divine was inwardly present. </p>

`Et fuit Jehovah cum Josepho': quod significet quod Divinum inesset, nempe Domino, Qui in supremo sensu per Josephum repraesentatur, hic Divinum in tentationibus, de quibus hic agitur; </p>
<p>Ipsum enim 
Divinum est Jehovah, Qui quod esset in Ipso seu inesset, significatur per quod `Jehovah fuit cum Josepho'; quia in sensu litterae agitur de Josepho, dicitur `cum illo', at in sensu interno ubi agitur 
de Domino, est `in Illo' (n): (o)quod in Illo', constare potest unicuique intra Ecclesiam ex eo quod a Jehovah conceptus (o)sit, quapropter Ipsum toties Patrem Suum nominat; ipsum esse hominis 
et inde intimum ejus vitae est a patre, induitiones seu exteriora sunt a matre; ideo Esse Domini ac inde intimum vitae Ipsius fuit Divinum quia Ipse Jehovah, ac induitiones seu exteriora fecerunt humanum 
quod a matre per nativitatem suscepit; hoc humanum tale erat ut tentari posset, conspurcatum enim malo a matre hereditario fuit; sed quia intimum erat Divinum, potuit ex propria potentia malum 
illud a matre hereditarium expellere, quod factum successive per tentationes, et tandem per ultimam quae fuit crucis, tunc Humanum Suum plene glorificavit, hoc est, Divinum fecit; inde constare 
potest quid intelligitur per quod Divinum inesset. </p>
