<h3 align="center" class="ired">属天的奥秘 第2904节</h3>
<h4 align="center"></h4><p><strong>2904.</strong>“撒拉活了”表就神性真理而言，该教会之前的一切时间和状态。这从“活了”的含义和“撒拉”的代表清楚可知。此处“活了”因涉及整个生命周期及其各个阶段，也就是说，涉及童年，青少年，成年、老年，故和一般的所有时间段一样（参看<a href="2625.htm">2625</a>，<a href="2788.htm">2788</a>，<a href="2837.htm">2837</a>节），表示状态；由于下面几节论述教会，因此“活了”表教会的时间和状态。“撒拉”是指神性真理（参看<a href="1468.htm">1468</a>，<a href="1901.htm">1901</a>，<a href="2063.htm">2063</a>，<a href="2172.htm">2172</a>，<a href="2173.htm">2173</a>，<a href="2198.htm">2198</a>，<a href="2507.htm">2507</a>节）；由此可知，此处“撒拉活了”在内义上是指就神性真理而言，教会之前的一切时间和状态。<br />撒拉在世时作为亚伯拉罕的妻子，代表主的与其神性良善结合的神性真理，这可见于上述引用的章节。她因代表主的神性真理，故也表示教会的神性真理。因为除了主的真理外，教会中没有其它真理。真理若非来自主，就不是真理。这一点既可从圣言，也可从源于它的信之教义明显看出来。这一点从圣言明显看出来，约翰福音：<br />若不是从天上赐的，人就不能得什么。（约翰福音<a href="http://39-27.cn/约3.27.htm">3:27</a>）<br />离了我，你们就能作什么。（约翰福音<a href="http://39-27.cn/约15.5.htm">15:5</a>）<br />这一点同样从信之教义明显看出来，这教义教导说：信的全部，即一切真理皆来自主。<br />圣言中的一切代表物和有意义的符号在至高意义上都关乎主；圣言的生命本身即源于此。它们既关乎主，也就关乎主的国，因为主是其国度的全部。在主的国中，来自祂的神性事物构成整个国度。因此，天使、灵人或世人越从主接受良善与真理，并相信它们皆来自主，就越在主的国中。相反，他越不接受，也不相信它们皆来自主，就越不在主的国或天堂中；这就是主是其国度的全部所表示的。</p>

The lives of Sarah were. That this signifies the times and states of the church as to the truths Divine that preceded, is evident from the signification here of "lives;" and from the representation of 
"Sarah." "Lives," here, because they regard age and its periods, namely, infancy, youth, adult age, and old age, signify states, as do all times in general (see n. 2625, 2788, 2837); and because the 
following verses treat of the church, therefore "lives" signify the times and states of the church. That "Sarah" is truth Divine, may be seen above (n. 1468, 1901, 2063, 2172, 2173, 2198, 2507); from 
which it follows that by "the lives of Sarah were," in the internal sense are here signified the times and states of the church as to the truths Divine which preceded. [2] That Sarah, while alive as 
Abraham's wife, represented the Lord's Divine Truth conjoined with His Divine Good, may be seen from the places above cited; and because the Lord's Divine Truth was represented by her, so also the truth 
Divine of the church is signified; for in the church there is no other truth than that which is the Lord's. Truth which is not from Him is not truth; as is also evident from the Word and from the 
doctrine of faith derived from it. It is evident from the Word, in John: </p>
<p>     A man can receive nothing, except it be given him from heaven (John 3:27).       Without Me ye can do nothing (John 15:5). And 
the same is evident from the doctrine of faith, in that the all of faith, that is, all truth, is from the Lord. [3] All and each of the representatives and significatives in the Word, in the 
highest sense regard the Lord; hence is the very life of the Word; and as they regard the Lord, they regard His kingdom also, for the Lord is the all in His kingdom; the Divine things which are from the 
Lord in His kingdom make the kingdom. Therefore insofar as an angel, spirit, or man receives good and truth from the Lord, and believes that it is from the Lord, so far he is in His kingdom; but insofar 
as he does not receive and does not believe that it is from the Lord, so far he is not in His kingdom. Thus the Divine things that are from the Lord make His kingdom, or heaven; and this is what 
is meant by the Lord being the all in His kingdom. </p>

'The life of Sarah was' means all the preceding times and states of the Church as regards Divine truths. This becomes clear from the meaning of 'the life' here, and from the representation of 'Sarah'. 
'The life' here - since it refers to the whole span of life and to the periods that constitute it, namely early childhood, youth, adult years, and old age means states, as do all periods of time in 
general, see <a href="2625.htm">2625</a>, <a href="2788.htm">2788</a>, <a href="2837.htm">2837</a>. And since the subject in what follows is the Church, 'the life' therefore means times and states of the Church. 'Sarah' represents Divine truth, see <a href="1468.htm">1468</a>, <a href="1901.htm">1901</a>, <a href="2063.htm">2063</a>, <a href="2172.htm">2172</a>, <a href="2173.htm">2173</a>, <a href="2198.htm">2198</a>, <a href="2507.htm">2507</a>. From this it follows that here 'the life of Sarah was' means in the internal sense all the preceding times and states of the Church as regards Divine truths. When she lived as Abraham's 
wife Sarah represented the Lord's Divine Truth joined to His Divine Good, as may be seen in the paragraphs just quoted. And as she represented the Lord's Divine Truth, so she also means the Church's 
Divine truth, for in the Church no other truth exists than that which is the Lord's. Truth that does not come from Him is not truth, as is also clear both from the Word itself and from the doctrine 
of faith drawn from it. It is clear from the Word itself in John, </p>
<blockquote>
Man cannot receive anything unless it is given him from heaven. <a href="http://bible.gospelcom.net/cgi-bin/bible?passage=John%203:27&amp;version=ESV&amp;interface=print&amp;showfn=yes&amp;showxref">John 3:27</a>.  
</blockquote>
<p>And elsewhere in John, </p>
<blockquote>
Without Me you can do 
nothing. <a href="http://bible.gospelcom.net/cgi-bin/bible?passage=John%2015:5&amp;version=ESV&amp;interface=print&amp;showfn=yes&amp;showxref">John 15:5</a>. 
</blockquote>
<p>The same is also clear from the doctrine of faith, which teaches that the whole of faith, that is, all truth, comes from the Lord. </p>
<p></p>
<p><b>[2]</b>
 The representatives and the meaningful 
signs in the Word are such that every single one in the highest sense has regard to the Lord; and from this springs the life itself of the Word. And because they have regard to the Lord, they also have 
regard to His kingdom, since the Lord is the All in His kingdom. Divine things from the Lord within His kingdom are what make it the kingdom. To the extent therefore that an angel, spirit, or man receives 
good and truth from the Lord, and believes that these come from Him, he is in His kingdom. But to the extent that he does not receive them, and does not believe that they come from the Lord, he 
is not in His kingdom. Thus Divine things from the Lord are what constitute His kingdom or heaven; and this is what is meant when it is said that the Lord is the All in His kingdom. </p>

</p><b>2904.</b>
`Fuerunt vitae Sarae':  quod significet tempora et status Ecclesiae quoad vera Divina qui praecesserunt, constare potest a significatione `vitarum' hic, et a repraesentatione `Sarae'; `vitae' hic, quia 
spectant aetatem et aetatis periodos, nempe infantiam, adolescentiam, adultam aetatem, et senectutem, significant status, sicut omnia tempora in communi, videatur n. 2625, 2788, 2837; et quia agitur 
in sequentibus de Ecclesia, ideo `vitae' significant tempora et status Ecclesiae; quod `Sarah' sit verum Divinum, videatur n. 1468, 1901, 2063, 2172, 2173, 2198, 2507; inde sequitur quod hic per `fuerunt 
vitae Sarae,' in sensu interno significentur tempora et status Ecclesiae quoad vera Divina qui praecesserunt.  Quod Sarah cum vixit uxor Abrahamo, repraesentaverit Divinum Verum Domini conjunctum 
Divino Bono Ipsius, ex locis citatis videri potest; et quia Divinum Verum Domini, ita quoque significat verum Divinum Ecclesiae, nam in Ecclesia non aliud verum datur quam quod est Domini; verum quod 
non ab Ipso, non est verum; ut quoque a Verbo et inde doctrina fidei constat; ex Verbo apud Johannem,           Non potest homo sumere quicquam, nisi sit datum illi e      caelo, iii 27: </p>
<p>et alibi,  
         Sine Me non potestis facere quicquam, xv 5; </p>
<p>ex doctrina fidei quod omne fidei a Domino, hoc est, omne verum. [2] {1}Repraesentativa et significativa ita se habent in Verbo, quod omnia et 
singula in supremo sensu spectent Dominum, inde est ipsa vita Verbi; et quia Dominum, etiam spectant regnum Ipsius, nam Dominus est omne in suo regno; Divina quae a Domino in regno Ipsius, faciunt regnum; 
ideo quantum boni et veri angelus, spiritus, et homo recipit a Domino, et credit quod a Domino, tantum est in regno Ipsius, quantum autem non recipit, nec credit quod a Domino, tantum non est in 
regno Ipsius; ita Divina quae a Domino, faciunt regnum Ipsius seu caelum; hoc est quod intelligitur per quod Dominus sit omne in Suo regno. @1 Transactions De Repraesentationibus et Correspondentiis
