<h3 align="center" class="ired">属天的奥秘 第6476节</h3>
<h4 align="center"></h4><p><strong>6476.</strong>每每念诵主祷文，我都明显感觉到一种朝向主的提升，这种提升就像一股吸力，好像我正在被往上拉。在这种时候，我的观念是开放的，与天上的某些社群的交流由此得以建立。我还注意到，主流入主祷文的每个细节，从而流入我从主祷文的含义所获得的每个思维观念。这种流注以无法形容的多样性得以实现，也就是说，在这一时刻不同于在那一时刻。这也证明主祷文的每个细节所包含的事物何等无限，主就存在于它们的每一个细节中。</p>

<p align="center"><b>Potts(1905-1910) 6476</b></p><p><b>6476.</b>
Whenever I have been reading the Lord's prayer, I have plainly perceived an elevation toward the Lord which was like an attraction, and at the same time my ideas were open, and from this there was effected 
a communication with some societies in heaven; and I noticed that there was an influx from the Lord into every detail of the prayer, thus into every idea of my thought that was from the meaning 
of the things in the prayer. The influx was effected with inexpressible variety, that is, not the same at one time as another; hence also it was made evident how infinite are the things contained in 
the prayer, and that the Lord is present in every one of them. </p>

<p align="center"><b>Elliott(1983-1999) 6476</b></p><p><b>6476.</b>
As often as I have recited the Lord's Prayer I have had the plain feeling of being raised towards the Lord, as though I was being hauled up. At these times my ideas were open and communication with some 
communities in heaven was consequently established. I have also noticed that the Lord flowed into each detail of the Prayer and so into every specific idea in my thought gained from the meaning of 
the things stated in the Prayer. This influx has been indescribably varying, that is to say, it has not been the same on one occasion as on another. This also proved how boundless were the things contained 
in each detail of the Prayer, and that the Lord was present in each of those details. </p>

Quoties legi rationem Domini toties percepi manifeste elevationem versus Dominum, quae erat instar attractionis, et tunc ideae apertae erant, et inde {1}facta est communicatio cum aliquibus societatibus 
in caelo; et appercipiebam quod influxus a Domino esset in singula Orationis, ita in singulas ideas cogitationis meae quae a sensu rerum in Oratione erant; influxus fiebat cum varietate ineffabili, 
nempe non una vice similiter ac altera; inde quoque constabat quam infinita singulis{2} inessent, et quod Dominus in singulis praesens esset. @1 i quoque $ @2 i ibi$ </p>
