<h3 align="center" class="ired">属天的奥秘 第2204节</h3>
<h4 align="center"></h4><p><strong>2204.</strong>“我主也老迈”表对真理的情感惊奇与这真理结合的理性良善也要脱去人性。这从“亚伯拉罕”和“撒拉”的代表，以及“老迈”的含义清楚可知：“亚伯拉罕”，也就是此处的“我主”表示理性良善，“撒拉”表示理性真理，如前所述（<a href="2198.htm">2198</a>节等）；“老迈”是指要脱去人性，也如前所述（<a href="2198.htm">2198</a>节）。人类理性良善是这样：它里面含有大量源于世俗快乐的东西，因为这良善不仅通过真理形成，还通过感官的快乐，以及存在于这个世界的许多其它快乐形成。当此人经历改造和重生时，属灵之善就被主植入在这些快乐中；然后，世俗之物由此被调和，之后相应地接受其来自那属灵之善的快乐。但主将一切世俗之物从这理性当中彻底逐出，从而将其变成神性。这就是令“撒拉”所表示的理性真理感到惊奇的事。</p>

<p align="center"><b>Potts(1905-1910) 2204</b></p><p><b>2204.</b>
And my lord old? That this signifies that the affection of truth wondered that the rational good to which truth was adjoined should also put off the human, is evident from the representation of Abraham, 
who is here "my lord," as here denoting rational good (spoken of above, n. 2198, and elsewhere); also from the signification of "growing old," as being to put off the human (also spoken of n. 2198). 
Human rational good is such as to have in itself much from worldly delights, for it is formed not only from truths, but also from the delights of sensuous things, and from many of the delights that 
are in the world. Into these delights (when the man is being reformed and regenerated) spiritual good is insinuated by the Lord; and thereby what is worldly is then tempered, and thus afterwards has 
its happiness therein. But the Lord utterly expelled from the rational all that was worldly, and so made it Divine; which is what the rational truth meant by "Sarah" wondered at. </p>

<p align="center"><b>Elliott(1983-1999) 2204</b></p><p><b>2204.</b>
'And my lord being old' means that the affection for truth was amazed that rational good to which truth was allied was also to cast off the human. This is clear from the representation of 'Abraham', 
to whom 'my lord' refers here, as rational good and from the representation of 'Sarah' as rational truth, dealt with above in <a href="2198.htm">2198</a> and elsewhere; and also from the meaning of 'growing old' as casting 
off the human, also dealt with in <a href="2198.htm">2198</a>. Human rational good is such that it has much within it which is derived from worldly delights, for that good is formed not only from truths but also from the delights 
of the senses and from many other delights that exist in the world. When a person is being reformed and regenerated spiritual good is implanted by the Lord in those delights, and by means of this 
good that which is worldly is mellowed, and after that accordingly receives its happiness from that spiritual good. But the Lord completely expelled from the rational everything worldly and so made 
it Divine. And it is this that amazed rational truth meant by 'Sarah'. </p>

<p align="center"><b>Latin(1748-1756) 2204</b>
</p><b>2204.</b>
Quod `dominus meus senex' significet quod affectio veri mirata quod rationale bonum cui adjunctum verum, etiam exueret humanum, constat ex repraesentatione `Abrahami' qui hic est `dominus meus,' quod 
hic sit rationale bonum; et (c)ex repraesentatione `Sarae' quod sit rationale verum, de qua supra n. 2198, et alibi; tum a significatione `consenescere' quod sit exuere humanum, de qua etiam n. 2198. 
 Bonum rationale humanum tale est quod habeat in se multum ex jucundis mundanis, nam formatum est non solum ex veris sed etiam ex jucundis sensualium et ex pluribus jucundis quae in mundo; quibus jucundis 
cum reformatur et regeneratur homo, bonum spirituale a Domino insinuatur, et tunc per id mundanum temperatur, et sic in illo dein suum felix habet.  At Dominus prorsus expulit omne mundanum e rationali, 
`et sic Divinum fecit; quod est quod verum rationale per `Sarah' intellectum, miratum. </p>
