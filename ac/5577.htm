<h4 align="center"></h4><p><strong>5577.</strong>“在那地”表就教会的组成部分而言。这从“地”的含义清楚可知，在圣言中，“地”是指教会，故在此是指教会的组成部分；事实上，凡表示教会的事物也都表示教会的组成部分，因为教会是由这些组成的。在圣言中，“地”之所以表示教会，是因为迦南地是自上古时代起教会所在的地方。所以当圣言提到“地”时，它表示迦南地；当指的是这具体的地时，要理解为教会。因为当提到地时，灵界里的人并不关注地的概念，而是关注住在这地上的民族的概念；然而也并非关注那民族的概念，而是关注那民族的本质的概念。所以，当论及地，并且所指的是迦南地时，他们关注教会的概念。<br />由此可见，那些以为根据旧约的预言，以及新约的启示录，在最后审判之日，一个新地和一个新天将要被造的人受了何等的迷惑；而事实上，一个“新地”无非表示一个新的外在教会，一个“新天”无非表示一个新的内在教会。那些以为在圣言中，当提到“全地”时，所指的不是教会，而是别的什么东西之人也受了迷惑。这表明那些以为圣言并不包含任何比唯独从文字闪耀出来的字义更神圣的意义之人对圣言的理解何等之少。教会自上古时代起就存在于迦南地（参看<a href="3686.htm">3686</a>，<a href="4447.htm">4447</a>，<a href="4454.htm">4454</a>，<a href="4516.htm">4516</a>，<a href="4517.htm">4517</a>，<a href="5136.htm">5136</a>节）；在圣言中，“地”表示教会（<a href="662.htm">662</a>，<a href="1066.htm">1066</a>，<a href="1068.htm">1068</a>，<a href="1262.htm">1262</a>，<a href="1413.htm">1413</a>，<a href="1607.htm">1607</a>，<a href="2928.htm">2928</a>，<a href="4447.htm">4447</a>节）；“新天和新地”表示一个新的教会，包括内在和外在（<a href="1733.htm">1733</a>，<a href="1850.htm">1850</a>，<a href="2117.htm">2117</a>，<a href="2118.htm">2118</a>e，<a href="3355.htm">3355</a>e，<a href="4535.htm">4535</a>节）。</p>

In the land. That this signifies about the things that were of the church, is evident from the signification of "land" in the Word, as being the church, here therefore the things that are of the church, 
because anything that signifies the church, signifies also the things that are of the church; for these produce it. That in the Word "land" signifies the church is because the land of Canaan was the 
place where the church had been from most ancient times. So when "land" or "earth" is mentioned in the Word, the land of Canaan is meant; and when this is meant, the church is meant; for when a land 
is mentioned they who are in the spiritual world do not stay in the idea of the land, but in that of the nation which is there, nor in the idea of the nation, but in that of the quality of that nation; 
thus in the idea of the church when "land" is spoken of and the land of Canaan is meant. From this it is plain how deluded are they who believe that at the day of the last judgment a new earth and 
new heaven will come into existence, according to the prophecies in the Old Testament, and in John in the New (where however by the "new earth" nothing else is meant than a new external church, and by 
the "new heaven" a new internal church), and also they who believe that anything but the church is meant where the "whole earth" is mentioned in the Word. Hence it is plain how little they apprehend 
the Word who think there is no holier sense in it than that which shines forth from the letter alone. That the church was in the land of Canaan from the most ancient times may be seen above (n. 3686, 
4447, 4454, 4516, 4517, 5136); that by "land" in the Word is signified the church (n. 662, 1066, 1068, 1262, 1413, 1607, 2928, 4447); and that by the "new heaven and new earth" is signified a new church 
internal and external (n. 1733, 1850, 2117, 2118, 3355, 4535). </p>

'In the land' means in the case of the integral parts of the Church. This is clear from the meaning of 'the land' in the Word as the Church, and therefore here the integral parts of the Church; for whatever 
serves to mean the Church also means its integral parts since it is made up of these. The reason why in the Word 'the land' means the Church is that the land of Canaan was the one in which the 
Church had existed since most ancient times. Consequently when the expression 'the land' appears in the Word it is used to mean the land of Canaan; and when this particular land is meant one understands 
the Church. For when the expression 'the land' appears there, people in the spiritual world do not concern themselves with the idea of a land, only with the idea of the nation inhabiting it; yet not 
with an idea of that nation but with an idea of the essential nature of it. Consequently they concern themselves with an idea of the Church when 'the land', used to mean the land of Canaan, appears 
there. </p>

 From this one may see how deluded those people are who believe - on the basis of prophetical utterances in the Old Testament, and in John in the New - that on the day when the last judgement 
takes place a new earth or land and a new heaven or sky are going to be created, when in fact nothing else than a new external Church is meant by 'a new earth' and a new internal Church by 'a new 
heaven'. These deluded people also believe that something other than the Church is meant when the expression 'the whole earth' is used in the Word. This shows how little understanding of the Word exists 
with those who imagine that the Word does not contain any meaning more holy than that shining out of the letter alone. </p>

`In terra': quod significet circa illa quae erant Ecclesiae, constat ex significatione `terrae' in Verbo quod sit Ecclesia, hic itaque quae sunt Ecclesiae, nam quae significant Ecclesiam, etiam significant 
illa quae sunt Ecclesiae, {1}haec enim faciunt illam; quod `terra' sit Ecclesia in Verbo, est quia terra Canaan fuit in qua ab antiquissimis temporibus fuerat Ecclesia; inde cum in Verbo nominatur 
terra, intelligitur terra Canaan, et cum haec, intelligitur Ecclesia; qui enim in spirituali mundo sunt, cum `terra' nominatur, non morantur in idea terrae sed in idea gentis quae ibi, nec in idea 
gentis sed in idea qualis illius gentis, proinde in idea Ecclesiae cum `terra' dicitur et per eam intelligitur terra Canaan.  [2]Inde patet quantum hallucinantur qui credunt quod die ultimi judicii 
nova terra et novum caelum exstiturum, secundum prophetica in Veteri Testamento, et apud Johannem in Novo, ubi tamen per `novam terram' non aliud intelligitur quam nova Ecclesia externa, et per `novum 
caelum' nova Ecclesia interna; tum {2}qui credunt, ubi nominatur in Verbo `universa terra', quod aliud intelligatur quam Ecclesia; inde patet quam parum capiunt Verbum qui non sensum sanctiorem quam 
qui ex sola littera elucet, ei inesse putant. {3}Quod in terra Canaane fuerit Ecclesia ab antiquissimis temporibus, n. 3686, 4447, 4454, 4516, 4517, 5136: quod per `terram' in Verbo significetur Ecclesia,
