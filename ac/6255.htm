<h4 align="center"></h4><p><strong>6255.</strong>创世记48:10-14.以色列年纪老迈，眼睛昏花，不能看见。约瑟领他们到他跟前，他就亲吻他们，拥抱他们。以色列对约瑟说，我想不到得见你的面，看哪，神还让我看见你的种。约瑟把他们从以色列两腿中领出来，自己就脸伏于地下拜。约瑟又拉着他们两个，以法莲在他的右手里，对着以色列的左手；玛拿西在他的左手里，对着以色列的右手，领他们到以色列跟前。以色列伸出右手来，按在以法莲的头上，以法莲乃是年幼的；左手按在玛拿西的头上，他的双手交叉着；玛拿西原是长子。<br />“以色列眼睛昏花”表他的模糊觉知。“年纪老迈”表因为他处于其代表的最后阶段。“不能看见”表没有注意到。“约瑟领他们到他跟前”表同在。“他就亲吻他们”表由对真理的情感所产生的一种联结。“拥抱他们”表由对良善的情感所产生的一种联结。“以色列对约瑟说”表朝内在的一种提升。“我想不到得见你的面”表他对他爱的流注不抱任何希望。“看哪，神还让我看见你的种”表不仅发觉爱的流注，还发觉源于它的良善与真理。“约瑟把他们从以色列两腿中领出来”表属世层里面意愿的良善和理解力的真理从属灵良善那一方的爱之情感那里被领出来。“自己就脸伏于地下拜”表他们的谦卑。“约瑟又拉着他们两个，以法莲在他的右手里，对着以色列的左手”表占据第二位的理解力的真理。“玛拿西在他的左手里，对着以色列的右手”表占据第一位的意愿的良善。“领他们到以色列跟前”表一种联结。“以色列伸出右手来，按在以法莲的头上”表他认为真理要占据第一位。“以法莲乃是年幼的”表尽管事实上它占据第二位。“左手按在玛拿西的头上”表他认为良善占据第二位。“他的双手交叉着”表这样不符合真正的秩序。“玛拿西原是长子”表因为良善的确占据第一位。</p>

Verses 10-14. And the eyes of Israel were heavy with old age; he could not see. And he brought them near unto him; and he kissed them and embraced them. And Israel said unto Joseph, I had not thought 
to see thy faces, and lo God hath made me see thy seed also. And Joseph brought them away from his thighs; and he bowed himself with his face to the earth. And Joseph took them both, Ephraim in his right 
hand on Israel's left hand, and Manasseh in his left hand on Israel's right hand, and brought them near unto him. And Israel put forth his right hand, and put it upon Ephraim's head, and he was the 
younger; and his left hand upon Manasseh's head; he put forth his hands crosswise; for Manasseh was the firstborn.  "And the eyes of Israel were heavy," signifies his obscure perception; "with old 
age," signifies because at the end of the representation; "he could not see," signifies no advertence; "and he brought them near unto him," signifies presence; "and he kissed them," signifies conjunction 
from the affection of truth; "and embraced them," signifies conjunction from the affection of good; "and Israel said unto Joseph," signifies elevation to the internal; "I had not thought to see thy 
faces," signifies that he had had no hope of the influx of his love; "and lo God hath made me see thy seed also," signifies that not only was the influx of love perceived, but also the good and truth 
thence derived; "and Joseph brought them away from his thighs," signifies the good of the will and the truth of the intellectual in the natural from the affection of love on the part of spiritual good; 
"and he bowed himself with his face to the earth," signifies their humiliation; "and Joseph took them both, Ephraim in his right hand on Israel's left hand," signifies the truth of the intellectual 
as in the second place; "and Manasseh in his left hand on Israel's right hand," signifies the good of the will in the first place; "and brought them near unto him," signifies adjunction; "and Israel 
put forth his right hand, and put it upon Ephraim's head," signifies that he accounted truth as being in the first place; "and he was the younger," signifies although it is in the second; "and his left 
hand upon Manasseh's head," signifies that he accounted good as being in the second place; "he put forth his hands crosswise," signifies thus not according to order; "for Manasseh was the firstborn," 
signifies since indeed good is in the prior place. </p>

Verses 10-14 And the eyes of Israel were weak<A name="fntext1"></a><A href="#fn1"><sup>a</sup></a> because of old age; he could not see. And [Joseph] made them draw near him, and [Israel] kissed them and embraced them. And Israel said to Joseph, I did 
not think to see your face, and behold, God has caused me to see your seed also. And Joseph brought them away from his thighs and bowed down, his face to the earth. And Joseph took them both, Ephraim 
in his right hand to Israel's left, and Manasseh in his left to Israel's right, and made them draw near him. And Israel put out his right hand and placed it on Ephraim's head, who was the younger, and 
his left hand on Manasseh's head; crosswise he put out his hands, for Manasseh was the firstborn. </p>
<p>'And the eyes of Israel were weak' means his obscurity of discernment. 'Because of old age' means 
because he was in the final phase of his representation 'He could not see means not noticing. 'And [Joseph] made them draw near him' means presence. 'And [Israel] kissed them' means a joining together 
resulting from an affection for truth. 'And embraced them' means a joining together resulting from an affection for good. 'And Israel said to Joseph' means a raising up to the internal. 'I did not think 
to see your face' means that he had not entertained any hope of an inflowing of his love. 'And behold, God has caused me to see your seed also' means that not only an inflow of love was discerned, 
but also the goodness and truth springing from it. 'And Joseph brought them away from his thighs' means that the good belonging to the will and the truth belonging to the understanding within the natural 
were brought away from an affection originating in love on the part of spiritual good. 'And bowed down, his face to the earth' means an expression of humility by them. 'And Joseph took them both, 
Ephraim in his right hand to Israel's left' means truth belonging to the understanding, to occupy the second place. 'And Manasseh in his left hand to Israel's right' means good belonging to the will, 
to occupy the first place. 'And made them draw near him' means a linking together. 'And Israel put out his right hand and placed it o, Ephraim's head' means that he considered truth to occupy the first 
place. 'Who was the younger' means though in fact it occupies the second place. 'And his left hand on Manasseh's head' means that he considered good to occupy the second place. 'Crosswise he put out 
his hands' means thus out of keeping with true order. 'For Manasseh was the firstborn' means since good does indeed occupy the first place.

Vers. 10-14.  Et oculi Israelis graves erant prae senectute, non potuit videre; et accedere fecit illos ad eum, et osculatus illos, et amplexus illos.  Et dixit Israel ad Josephum, Videre facies tuas 
non cogitavi, et ecce videre fecit mihi Deus etiam semen tuum.  Et abduxit Joseph illos ex femoribus ejus, et incurvavit (x)se ad faciem suam terram.  Et accepit Joseph ambos illos, Ephraimum in dextra 
sua a sinistra Israelis, et Menasheh in sinistra sua a dextra Israelis, et accedere fecit ad eum.  Et misit Israel dextram suam et posuit super capite Ephraimi, et is minor, et sinistram suam super 
capite Menashis; conversim misit manus suas, quia Menasheh primogenitus. `Et oculi Israelis graves erant' significat apperceptionem obscuram ejus: `prae senectute' significat quia in fine repraesentationis: 
`non potuit videre' significat non animadvertentiam: et accedere fecit illos ad eum, significat praesentiam: `et osculatus illos' significat conjunctionem ex affectione veri: `et amplexus illos' 
significat conjunctionem ex affectione boni: `et dixit Israel ad Josephum' significat elevationem ad internum: `Videre facies tuas non cogitavi' significat quod in non spe fuerit de influxu amoris 
ejus: et ecce videre fecit mihi Deus etiam semen tuum' significat quod non solum influxus amoris apperceptus, sed etiam bonum et verum inde: `et abduxit Joseph illos ex femoribus ejus' significat bonum 
voluntarii et verum intellectualis in naturali ab affectione amoris a parte boni spiritualis: `et incurvavit se ad faciem suam terram' significat humiliationem illorum: `et accepit Joseph ambos illos, 
Ephraimum in dextra sua a sinistra Israelis' significat verum intellectualis ut secundo loco: `et Menashen in sinistra sua a dextra Israelis' significat bonum voluntarii primo loco: `et accedere fecit 
ad eum' significat {1} adjunctionem: `et misit Israel dextram suam et posuit super capite Ephraimi' significat quod primo loco reputaret verum: `et is minor' significat tametsi id altero loco sit: 
`et sinistram suam super capite Menashis' significat quod secundo loco reputaret bonum: `conversim misit manus suas' significat sic non secundum ordinem: `quia Menasheh primogenitus' significat siquidem 
bonum est priore loco. @1 A here i sic$ </p>
