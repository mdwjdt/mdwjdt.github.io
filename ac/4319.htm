<h3 align="center" class="ired">属天的奥秘 第4319节</h3>
<h4 align="center"></h4><p><strong>4319.</strong>大量经历向我表明，不仅世人，而且灵人，以及天使都无法凭自己思考、言说并行出任何事，而是通过其他人；而这些其他人也不能凭自己如此行，还要通过其他人，依此类推。因此，所有人，无论集体的还是个体的，都凭生命的第一源头，也就是凭主思考、谈论并行动，无论他们如何看似完全独立，如同凭自己这样行。这一事实经常向那些在肉身生活时曾以为和确信以下观念的灵人显明，即：所有事物都在他们自己里面，而非之外，也就是说，他们凭自己和自己的灵魂思考、言说并行动；生命看似已经植入他们自己和自己的灵魂。他们还通过诸如存在于来世，但不可能存在于世上的活生生的经历被指示，恶人从地狱，而善人从天堂，也就是经由天堂从主思考、意愿和行动；然而，无论邪恶还是良善，都看似始于这些人自己。基督徒从他们取自圣言的教义知道这一点，也就是以下教义：一切邪恶皆出自魔鬼，一切良善皆出自主；然而却很少有人相信。他们因不相信，故将他们所思想、意愿和行出的邪恶变成自己的。然而，他们没有将任何良善变成自己的，因为凡相信自己所行良善的源头在于他们自己的人都会索要良善，将其归于自己，从而将功德置于它们里面。他们还从教会的这一教义，即没有人能凭自己行任何良善，以致凡源于他自己及其小我的，都是邪恶，无论它如何看似良善；但这个教义也少有人相信，尽管它就是真理。<br />已经确认这一观点，即他们凭自己活着，因而凡他们所思想、意愿和行出的，皆始于他们自己的恶人，当被指示事实完全符合这个教义时，声称他们现在相信了。但他们被告知，知道并不等于相信，相信是内在的，只能存在于对良善与真理的情感中，因而只能存在于那些处于对邻之仁的良善之人当中。这些灵人因是邪恶的，故坚持认为他们现在已经相信了，因为他们看见了。不过，他们接受了来世的常规检查，也就是被天使严格查看。当他们被查看时，其脑袋的上半部分回缩，大脑显得粗糙、多毛，充满幽暗。这表明那些仅有记忆知识的信仰，却没有真信之人的性质；知道不等于相信。那些知道并相信之人的脑袋看似人的脑袋，大脑显得井然有序、雪白光亮；因为他们接受天堂之光。但对那些只知道并以为他们由此相信，其实并不相信的人来说，由于他们活在邪恶当中，故天堂之光没有被接受，因而在这光中的聪明和智慧也没有被接受。因此，当他们接受天使社群，也就是天堂之光时，这光在他们当中就沦为黑暗。这就是为何他们的大脑看似充满幽暗的原因。</p>

It has been shown by much experience that not only a man, but a spirit, and also an angel, thinks, speaks, and does nothing from himself, but from others; nor these others from themselves, but again 
from others, and so on; and thus all and each from the First of life, that is, from the Lord, however completely this may appear to be as from themselves. This has often been shown to spirits who in the 
life of the body had believed and had confirmed themselves in the belief, that all things were in themselves, or that they think, speak, and act from themselves and their soul, in which life appears 
implanted. It has also been shown by living experiences (such as exist in the other life but are impossible in the world), that the evil think, will, and act from hell, and the good from heaven (that 
is, through heaven from the Lord), and that nevertheless both evils and goods appear as from themselves. Christians know this from the doctrine which they draw from the Word-that evils are from the 
devil, and goods from the Lord; but there are few who believe it. And because they do not believe it, they appropriate to themselves the evils which they think, will, and act; but the goods are not appropriated 
to them; for they who believe goods to be from themselves, claim and ascribe them to themselves, and thus place merit in them. They also know from the doctrine in the church, that no one can 
do anything good from himself, insomuch that whatever is from himself and his own is evil, however much it may appear as good; but this also few believe, although it is true.  [2] The evil who had 
confirmed themselves in this opinion - that they live from themselves, and consequently that whatever they think, will, and act is from themselves-when shown that the case is exactly in accordance with 
the doctrine, said that they now believed. But they were told that knowing is not believing, and that believing is internal, and is impossible except in the affection of good and truth, consequently 
is possible to none but those who are in the good of charity toward the neighbor. Being evil, the same spirits insisted that they now believed because they saw. But examination was made by an experience 
familiar in the other life, namely, by their being looked into by angels; and when they were looked into, the upper part of their head appeared to be withdrawn, and the brain to be rough, hairy, and 
dark, which showed what is the inward quality of those who have only a faith of memory knowledge, but not a true faith; and that to know is not to believe. For the head of those who know and believe 
appears as human, and the brain well ordered, snow-white, and lucid; for heavenly light is received by them. But with those who only know and suppose that they thereby believe, and yet do not believe, 
because they live in evil, heavenly light is not received, consequently neither are the intelligence and wisdom which are in that light; and therefore when they draw near to angelic societies, that 
is, to heavenly light, this light is turned with them into darkness. This is the reason why their brain appeared dark. </p>

Much experience has shown me that no man or spins, or any angel, thinks, says, or does anything at all from himself, but from others. Nor are these others themselves the source of anything they think, 
say, or do but others again, and so on with these. Thus all, corporately and individually, think, speak, and act from the First Source of life, that is, from the Lord, no matter how completely they 
seem to do so independently, by themselves. This has often been shown to spirits who had believed during their lifetime, and had convinced themselves of the idea, that nothing lay outside themselves, 
that is, the whole source of their thought, speech, and activity lay within themselves and their own souls in which life has been implanted and shows itself. They have also been shown through actual experiences 
(such as one can have in the next life but are not possible in the world) that the source of evil people's thought, will, and action is hell, and the source of good people's is heaven, that 
is, the Lord through heaven; yet for all that, their evil or else their good seems to begin within those people themselves. This is something Christians know from teaching drawn from the Word, that is 
to say, the teaching that all evil comes from the devil and all good from the Lord. Yet there are few who believe it. And because they do not believe it they make their own the evils which they think, 
will, and do. They do not however make any good their own, for people who believe that the source of the good they do lies within themselves lay claim to it and attribute it to themselves, and in so 
doing place merit in it. They also know from what is taught in the Church that no one is able independently, by himself, to do anything good, insomuch that whatever originates in himself and in his 
proprium is evil, no matter how much it may seem to be good. This also few people believe, even though it is the truth. </p>
<p></p>
<p><b>[2]</b>
 Evil people who have convinced themselves of the idea that they live independently 
by themselves, and therefore that whatever they think, will, and do begins in themselves, have declared, when shown that the truth of the matter is exactly as doctrine teaches, their readiness 
to believe it. But they have been told that knowing does not amount to believing, and that believing is something internal and cannot exist except within the affection for good and truth, and therefore 
can exist only with those who are governed by the good of charity towards the neighbour. Those same spirits, being evil ones, insisted that they were ready to believe it because they had seen it. 
But they were subjected to examination in a way commonly experienced in the next life, namely that of close inspection by angels. When they were inspected the upper part of their heads seemed to have 
been removed and their brains to be rough and hairy and also full of darkness. This showed the inner nature of people whose faith is no more than knowledge and not true faith, and that knowing something 
does not amount to believing it. For the heads of those who know and also believe look like human heads, and their brains look well-ordered, white, and shining, since heavenly light is received by 
them. But with those who merely know and imagine that in knowing they therefore believe, when in fact they do not believe because they lead an evil life, heavenly light is not received, nor consequently 
intelligence and wisdom which are present within that light. For this reason when they approach angelic communities, that is, heavenly light, it turns for them into darkness. This is why their brains 
are seen to be full of darkness. </p>

Multa experientia ostensum est quod tam homo quam spiritus ut et angelus, nihil ex se cogitet, loquatur et agat, sed ab aliis, nec hi alii a se sed iterum ab aliis, et sic porro, ac ita omnes et singuli 
a Primo vitae, hoc est a Domino, utcumque prorsus apparet sicut ex se; hoc saepius ostensum es spiritibus qui in vita corporis crediderunt et se confirmarunt quod in se essent omnia, seu quod 
ex se et sua anima in qua vita apparet insita, cogitent, loquantur et agant {1}; ostensum quoque per vivas experientias, (quales in altera vita dantur sed non dari possunt in mundo) quod mali cogitent, 
velint et agant ab inferno et boni ex caelo, hoc est, per caelum a Domino; et quod usque appareant mala et quoque bona sicut ab ipsis; hoc sciunt Christiani ex doctrinali quod ex Verbo, nempe 
quod mala ex diabolo et bona a Domino, sed pauci sunt qui credunt; et quia non credunt, appropriant sibi mala quae cogitant, volunt et agunt {2}; sed bona illis non appropriantur, nam qui credunt 
bona a se esse sibi illa vindicant et tribuunt ac ita meritum in illis ponunt; sciunt etiam ex doctrinali in Ecclesia, quod nemo facere possit aliquod bonum a se, usque adeo ut quicquid a se et suo 
proprio, sit malum, utcumque ut bonum appareat, sed etiam hoc pauci credunt tametsi verum est.  [2] Mali qui se confirmarunt in illa opinione quod vivant ex se, proinde quicquid cogitant, volunt 
et agunt ex se sit, cum illis ostensum quod res se habeat prorsus secundum doctrinale dixerunt quod nunc credant; sed dictum est illis quod scire non sit credere et quod credere sit internum, et quod 
id dari nequeat nisi in affectione boni et veri, proinde non aliis quam qui in bono charitatis erga proximum sunt {3} iidem spiritus quia mali, instabant quod nunc credant quia viderunt; sed exploratum 
est per experientiam in altera vita familiarem, quod nempe ab angelis inspiciantur; cum illi inspicerentur, apparuit superior capitis corum pars subtracta, ac cerebrum hirsutum capillare et 
tenebricosum; inde patuit quales intus essent qui modo fidem scientificam habent, non veram, et quod scire non sit credere; qui enim sciunt et credunt, illorum caput apparet sicut humanum, et cerebrum 
ordinatum, niveum et lucidum, nam lux caelestis ab illis recipitur; sed qui modo sciunt, et putant se inde credere, et tamen non credunt, quia in malo vivunt, apud illos non {4} lux caelestis 
recipitur, (o)proinde non intelligentia et sapientia quae luci illi insunt; quapropter cum approximant ad societates angelicas, hoc est, ad lucem caelestem, vertitur haec illis in tenebras inde est 
quod cerebrum illorum apparuerit tenebricosum.      @1 faciant$      @2 faciunt$      @3 vivunt$      @4 after caelestis$ </p>
