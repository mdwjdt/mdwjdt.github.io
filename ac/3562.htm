<h3 align="center" class="ired">属天的奥秘 第3562节</h3>
<h4 align="center"></h4><p><strong>3562.</strong>“以撒摸着他”表全部直觉。这从“摸”的含义清楚可知，“摸”是指至内在和全部的直觉（参看<a href="3528.htm">3528</a>，<a href="3559.htm">3559</a>节），在此是指全部直觉，因为对一切事物的直觉都出自至内在的直觉。也就是说，拥有至内在的直觉之人也拥有对下面一切事物的直觉，因为下面的事物无非是上面事物的衍生物和构成物。事实上，至内在的事物就是它下面事物全部中的全部。因为若非凡在下之物皆来自内层事物，或也可说，来自它上面的事物，犹如结果来自其有效的起因，它根本就不存在。由此明显可知为何目的决定了一个人在来世幸福还是不幸，因为目的就是一切起因的至内层，以致若目的不存在于起因中，事实上不是它的全部，起因根本就不存在。目的以同样的方式而为一切结果的至内层，因为结果就源于这样一个起因。正因如此，凡属于人的事物，都从他所着眼的目的而获得它的存在。因此，在来世，人的状态取决于其目的的本质（参看<a href="1317.htm">1317</a>，<a href="1568.htm">1568</a>，<a href="1571.htm">1571</a>，<a href="1645.htm">1645</a>，<a href="1909.htm">1909</a>，<a href="3425.htm">3425</a>节）。由此可见，摸因表至内在的直觉，故也表全部直觉。</p>

And he felt him. That this signifies all perception, is evident from the signification of "feeling," as being an inmost and complete perception (see above, n. 3528, 3559), here, all perception, because 
the perception of all things is from that which is inmost, that is, they who are in inmost perception are in the perception of all things which are beneath; for the things which are beneath are nothing 
but derivations and compositions therefrom, inasmuch as the inmost is the all in all of the things beneath it; for unless whatever is beneath is from things interior; or what is the same, from things 
superior, as an effect from its efficient cause, it does not come into existence. And this shows why the end makes a man happy or unhappy in the other life; for the end is the inmost of every cause, 
insomuch that unless the end is in the cause, nay, unless it is the all thereof, the cause is not; and in like manner the end is the inmost of every effect, for the effect is from such cause; and 
because this is so, whatever pertains to man derives its being from the end which is in him, and hence in the other life his state is such as is his end (see n. 1317, 1568, 1571, 1645, 1909, 3425). From 
this it may be seen that as feeling signifies inmost perception, it therefore signifies all perception. </p>

'And he felt him' means complete perception. This is clear from the meaning of 'feeling' as inmost and complete perception, dealt with above in <a href="3528.htm">3528</a>, <a href="3559.htm">3559</a>, here complete perception because the perception 
of all things comes from inmost perception. That is, people who possess inmost perception possess a perception of everything that is below, for the things that are below are nothing else than derivatives 
and combinations of what is above. Indeed everything inmost exists in all the things below it that are its own, for unless that which is lower is the product of the things that are interior, 
or what amounts to the same, of those that are above it, as an effect is the product of its efficient cause, it does not come into existence at all. From this it is evident why the end in view determines 
a person's happiness or unhappiness in the next life, for the end is the inmost aspect of every cause, so much so that if the end does not exist within the cause, indeed if it is not its all, no cause 
exists at all. The end is in a similar way the inmost aspect of every effect, for an effect springs from such a cause. This being so, whatever exists with a person owes its very being (esse) to the 
end which he has in view. In the next life therefore a person's state is determined by the essential nature of whatever end he has in view, see <a href="1317.htm">1317</a>, <a href="1568.htm">1568</a>, <a href="1571.htm">1571</a>, <a href="1645.htm">1645</a>, <a href="1909.htm">1909</a>, <a href="3425.htm">3425</a>. From this it may 
be seen that, since it means inmost perception, 'feeling' consequently means complete perception. </p>

</p><b>3562.</b>
`Et palpavit illum': quod significet perceptionem omnem, constat (c)ex significatione `palpare' quod sit perceptio intima et omnis, de qua supra n. 3528, 3559, hic perceptio omnis, quia omnium perceptio 
est ab intima, hoc est, qui in intima perceptione sunt, in perceptione omnium sunt quae infra, nam quae infra, non sunt nisi quam derivationes et compositiones inde; est enim intimum omne in omnibus 
inferiorum sui, nam quod inferius est, nisi sit ab interioribus, seu quod idem, a superioribus, sicut effectus a sua causa efficiente, non existit: inde patet cur finis facit hominem felicem vel infelicem 
in altera vita, finis enim est intimum omnis causae, usque adeo ut si non finis sit in causa, immo nisi sit omne ejus, non sit causa; similiter est finis intimum omnis effectus, nam effectus a 
causa tali est, {1}et quia ita est, quicquid apud hominem est, trahit suum esse a fine qui apud eum, et inde in altera vita in tali statu est in quali ejus finis, videantur 1317, 1568, 1571, 1645 1939, 
3425. Inde constare potest quod `palpare,' quia significat perceptionem intimam, inde significet perceptionem omnem. @1 ita omne causa, proinde omne finis$  </p>
