<h3 align="center" class="ired">属天的奥秘 第8197节</h3>
<h4 align="center"></h4><p><strong>8197.</strong>“它是云和黑暗”表这一方的邪恶所生的虚假加剧；“照亮黑夜”那一方的源于良善的真理变得更加光明。这从“云和黑暗”、“照亮黑夜”的含义清楚可知：“云和黑暗”是指邪恶所生虚假的加剧，“云”表示虚假（参看<a href="1043.htm">1043</a>，<a href="1047.htm">1047</a>，<a href="8137.htm">8137</a>，<a href="8138.htm">8138</a>节），“黑暗”也是（<a href="1839.htm">1839</a>，<a href="1860.htm">1860</a>，<a href="4418.htm">4418</a>，<a href="4531.htm">4531</a>，<a href="7688.htm">7688</a>，<a href="7711.htm">7711</a>节）；“照亮黑夜”是指源于良善的真理的光照。“夜间的火柱”表示由来自良善的光照所缓和的一种真理模糊的状态（参看<a href="8108.htm">8108</a>节）。<br />至于这个柱子，即它给埃及人带来黑暗，给以色列人带来光明，情况如下：此处由“柱子”所表示的主之同在是天堂之光本身，从这个天堂获得它的光，这光比世间正午之光还要明亮千倍。然而，同样这光，却在恶人中间变成了幽暗，哪怕他们就在此光本身中，它随着邪恶所生的虚假在他们中间越发密集而变得越发幽暗。原因在于，从主发出的神之真理在天使眼前显为光；但它在那些沉浸于邪恶所生的虚假之人面前无法显为光，只能显为幽暗，因为虚假是真理的对立面，会扼杀真理。这就是为何柱子，也就是主的同在，给埃及人带来云和黑暗，因为“埃及人”表示那些沉浸于邪恶所生的虚假之人；又为何它在以色列人中间照亮黑夜，因为“以色列人”表示那些处于源于良善的真理之人。主照着各人的品质而向各人显现（参看<a href="1861.htm">1861</a>e，<a href="6832.htm">6832</a>节）。</p>

And it was a cloud and darkness. That this signifies the condensation of falsity from evil on the one side, and that it lighted up the night, signifies the enlightenment of truth from good on the other, 
is evident from the signification of a "cloud and darkness," as being the condensation of falsity from evil (that a "cloud" denotes falsity see n. 1043, 1047, 8137, 8138; also "darkness," n. 1839, 
1860, 4418, 4531, 7688, 7711); and from the signification of "to light up the night," as being the enlightenment of truth by good. (That the "pillar of fire by night" denotes a state of obscurity tempered 
by enlightenment by good, see n. 8108.)  [2] In regard to this circumstance, that the pillar brought darkness upon the Egyptians, and gave light to the sons of Israel, the case is as follows. The 
presence of the Lord, here signified by "the pillar," is heavenly light itself, from which heaven has its light, and this light is a thousand times brighter than the noonday light of the world. But 
the same light becomes thick darkness with the evil: even if they are in the light itself, and it becomes thicker darkness in proportion as the falsity from evil is denser with them. The reason is that 
the truth Divine proceeding from the Lord appears before the eyes of the angels as light, but to those who are in falsities from evil it cannot appear as light, but as thick darkness, for falsity is 
opposite to truth and extinguishes truth. Hence it is that the pillar, which was the presence of the Lord, brought cloud and darkness on the Egyptians, because by "the Egyptians" are signified those 
who are in falsities from evil, and that it lighted up the night with the sons of Israel, because by "the sons of Israel" are signified those who are in truth from good. That the Lord appears to everyone 
according to his quality, see n. 1861, 6832. </p>

'And it was cloud and darkness [for the former]' means that the falsity arising from evil on the one side was intensified; 'and it lit up the night [for the latter]' means that the truth springing from 
good on the other side grew brighter. This is clear from the meaning of 'cloud and darkness' as the intensification of falsity arising from evil ('cloud' means falsity, see <a href="1043.htm">1043</a>, <a href="1047.htm">1047</a>, <a href="8137.htm">8137</a>, <a href="8138.htm">8138</a>, 
as also does 'darkness', <a href="1839.htm">1839</a>, <a href="1860.htm">1860</a>, <a href="4418.htm">4418</a>, <a href="4531.htm">4531</a>, <a href="7688.htm">7688</a>, <a href="7711.htm">7711</a>); and from the meaning of 'lighting up the night' as the brightening of truth springing from good. 'A pillar of fire by night' means a state 
of dimmed truth, moderated by enlightenment from good, <a href="8108.htm">8108</a>. </p>

<p><b>[2]</b>
 With regard to the pillar, that it brought darkness to the Egyptians but light among the children of Israel, the situation is that 
the Lord's presence, which is meant here by 'the pillar', is heavenly light itself. From this heaven derives its light, a light that is a thousand times brighter than light in the world at midday. Yet 
the same light turns into thick darkness among the evil, even though they may be in actual light; and it turns to even thicker darkness as the falsity arising from evil among them grows in intensity. 
The reason for this is that God's truth coming from the Lord appears before angels' eyes as light. But it cannot appear as light to those steeped in falsities arising from evil, only as thick darkness, 
since falsity is the opposite of truth and snuffs it out. This is why the pillar, which was the Lord's presence, brought cloud and darkness to the Egyptians, 'the Egyptians' meaning those steeped in 
falsities arising from evil, and lit up the night among the children of Israel, 'the children of Israel' meaning those guided by truth springing from good. The Lord appears to each person in a way suited 
to the kind of person he is, see <a href="1861.htm">1861</a>(end), <a href="6832.htm">6832</a>. </p>

`Et fuit nubes et tenebrae': quod significet condensationem falsi ex malo ex una parte; `et illuminabat noctem' {1}quod significet illustrationem veri ex bono (c)ex altera, constat ex significatione 
`nubis et tenebrarum' quod {2}sint condensatio falsi ex malo; quod `nubes' sit falsitas, videatur n. 1043, 1047, 8137, 8138; quod etiam `tenebrae,' n. 1839, 1860, 4418, 4531, 7688, 7711; ex significatione 
`illuminare noctem' quod sit illustratio veri ex bono; quod `columna ignis noctu' sit status obscuritatis veri temperatus per illustrationem a bono, videatur n. 8108. 	2 Cum hoc quod columna induceret 
Aegyptiis tenebras et illuminaret filios Israelis ita se habet: praesentia Domini, quae hic significatur per `columnam,' est ipsa lux caelestis; caelum inde suam lucem habet, quae lux est millies 
illustrior luce meridiana mundi; sed eadem lux fit caligo apud malos, etiamsi in ipsa luce {3}sint; et fit caligo eo major quo densius est falsum ex malo apud illos; causa est quia verum Divinum procedens 
a Domino apparet coram oculis angelorum ut lux; {4}sed illis qui in {5}falsis ex malo sunt, non apparere potest ut lux sed ut caligo, nam falsum oppositum est vero et exstinguit verum; inde est 
quod columna, quae erat praesentia Domini, induceret nubem et tenebras Aegyptiis, {6}quia per `Aegyptios' significantur qui in falsis ex malo, et quod illuminaret noctem apud filios Israelis, quia 
per `filios Israelis' significantur qui in vero ex bono; quod Dominus appareat cuique secundum quale ejus, videatur n. 1861 fin., 6832. 	@1 Before illuminabat I$ 	@2 sit$ 	@3 sunt$ 	@4 inde$ 	@5
