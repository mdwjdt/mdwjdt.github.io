<h3 align="center" class="ired">属天的奥秘 第2618节</h3>
<h4 align="center"></h4><p><strong>2618.</strong>“耶和华便给撒拉成就”表这二者融合的状态，也就是主的神性属灵之物在其神性属天之物内融合的状态。这从“成就（doing）”、“耶和华”和“撒拉”的含义清楚可知：“成就（doing）”是指结果的全部实现，因而是指状态；“耶和华”和“撒拉”的含义如刚才所述（<a href="2616.htm">2616</a>节）。关于主的神性属灵之物在其神性属天之物内融合的状态，这就是善与真的婚姻，该婚姻是天上婚姻的来源。天上的婚姻就是主在天上和地上的国，这就是为何在圣言中，主的国度多次被称为婚姻，并比作婚姻。其原因是一个奥秘，即在主里面，神性良善与真理，并神性真理与良善的婚姻是一切婚姻之爱的源头，并通过婚姻之爱而成为一切属天和属灵之家的源头。更深层次的奥秘则体现在这些话里：“耶和华按着祂所说的眷顾（visited）撒拉，耶和华便照祂所说的话给撒拉成就”；不过，这些奥秘由于难以言传而无法为人所知。这些话就包含主的神性与其人性融合的状态本身。主藉着天上的光将这种状态的表象呈现在众天使眼前，还藉着无法描述的代表物来说明它们。但是，这些表象却无法呈现给世人，因为它们将不得不凭借诸如属于尘世之光之类的物体来呈现，而这类物体却无法将这类奥秘表达出来。事实上，基于这类事物的描述只会使它们变得更模糊。</p>

And Jehovah did unto Sarah. That this signifies the state of unition, namely, of the Lord's Divine spiritual in His Divine celestial, is evident from the signification of "doing," when predicated of 
the Lord's Divine, as being the sum total of the effect, consequently the state; and from the signification of "Jehovah," and also of "Sarah" (concerning which see above, n. 2616). As regards the state 
of unition of the Lord's Divine spiritual in His Divine celestial, this is the very marriage itself of good and truth, from which comes the heavenly marriage; and this marriage is the Lord's kingdom 
in the heavens and on earth. For this reason the Lord's kingdom is so frequently in the Word called a "marriage," and is compared to a marriage. The reason (a secret one) is that all conjugial love (and 
through this all celestial and spiritual love) comes from the marriage of Divine good and truth, and of Divine truth and good, in the Lord. What further arcana are enfolded in these words: that "Jehovah 
visited Sarah as He had said," and that "Jehovah did unto Sarah as He had spoken," cannot be declared, because they are inexpressible; for they comprise the very state itself of the unition of 
the Lord's Divine with His Human. Appearances of this are presented by the Lord before the angels by means of heavenly lights, and are illustrated by means of ineffable representations; but they cannot 
be presented before men, because it would have to be done by means of such things as belong to the light of the world, into which such arcana do not fall; nay, by a description based on such things 
they become more obscure. </p>

<p align="center"><b>Elliott(1983-1999) 2618</b></p><p><b>2618.</b>
'And Jehovah did to Sarah' means a state when the two existed united together - the Lord's Divine spiritual within His Divine celestial. This is clear from the meaning of 'doing', when it has reference 
to the Lord's Divine, as the entire realization of the effect and consequently of the state; and from the meaning of 'Jehovah', and also of 'Sarah', dealt with just above in <a href="2616.htm">2616</a>. As regards the state 
when the two existed united together- the Lord's Divine spiritual within His Divine celestial- this is the marriage itself of good and truth, which is the origin of the heavenly marriage. The heavenly 
marriage is the Lord's kingdom in heaven and on earth, and that is why so many times in the Word the Lord's kingdom is called a marriage, and is compared to a marriage. The reason, which is an arcanum, 
is that the marriage of Divine Good and Truth, and of Divine Truth and Good, within the Lord is the source of all conjugial love, and through that love the source of all celestial and spiritual 
love. What further arcana are embodied in these words - 'Jehovah visited Sarah as He had said, and Jehovah did to Sarah as He had spoken' - cannot be made known as they lie beyond description. For these 
words comprehend the state itself when the Lord's Divine exists united to His Human. Appearances of this state are presented by the Lord to the eyes of the angels by means of heavenly lights, and 
are illustrated also by means of indescribable representations. But those appearances cannot be presented to men because they would have to be presented by means of objects such as belong to the light 
of the world, which objects cannot serve to express them. Indeed a description that relies on such things makes them all the more obscure. </p>

</p><b>2618.</b>
`Et fecit Jehovah Sarae': quod significet statum unitionis, nempe Divini spiritualis Domini in Divino caelesti Ipsius, constat ex significatione `facere' cum praedicatur de Divino Domini, quod sit omne 
effectus, proinde status; et ex significatione `Jehovae,' tam `Sarae,' de qua mox supra n. 2616. Quod statum unitionis Divini spiritualis Domini in Divino caelesti Ipsius attinet, est ipsum conjugium 
boni et veri, unde conjugium caeleste, quod conjugium est regnum Domini in caelis et terris, ideo regnum Domini toties in Verbo dicitur `conjugium,' et comparatur conjugio; causa quae arcanum, est 
quia ex conjugio Divini {1} Boni et Veri, (c)et Divini Veri et Boni in Domino est omnis amor conjugialis, et per hanc omnis amor caelestis et spiritualis.  Quae praeterea arcana involvuntur his verbis 
quod `Jehovah visitavit Saram, quemadmodum dixit, et fecit Jehovah Sarae, quemadmodum locutus est,' non edici possunt quia inexpressibilia; comprehendunt enim ipsum statum unitionis Divini Domini cum 
Humano Ipsius; apparentiae ejus sistuntur coram angelis a Domino per caelestes luces, et illustrantur per repraesentationes ineffabiles; sed nequeunt coram hominibus, quia erunt per talia quae sunt 
lucis mundi, in quae non cadunt, immo per descriptionem ex talibus plus obscurantur. 	@1 Divino I.$ </p>
