<h3 align="center" class="ired">属天的奥秘 第2818节</h3>
<h4 align="center"></h4><p><strong>2818.</strong>“要杀他的儿子”表直到凡来源于纯人性之物都死了。这从这些话的内义清楚可知，它们表示主的最严厉、最内在的试探，最后的试探就是十字架的试探。在这些试探中，显然，纯人性也死了。这不可能由亚伯拉罕的儿子或以撒来代表，因为献子女为祭是可憎的事。然而，纯人性的死亡只要能被体现出来，就被体现出来；也就是说，它体现在献以撒为祭的试图中，而非体现在实际献他为祭的行为中。由此清楚可知，“亚伯拉罕就伸手拿刀，要杀他的儿子”这句话表示直到纯人性的一切都死了。<br />人们从上古时代就得知主要降世并受死。这从以下事实明显看出来：献子女为祭的习俗曾盛行在外邦人中，他们以为这样自己就洁净了，并令神满意。若不是从古人那里得知人子要来，并如他们所相信的，会成为一个祭品，他们不可能将这种可憎的习俗置于最重要的宗教仪式中。雅各的儿子也倾向于这种可憎行为，亚伯拉罕也是。因为若不通过一个人所倾向的事，没有人受到试探。雅各的儿子就有这些倾向，这一事实清楚可见于先知书。但为了防止他们陷入这可憎的行为，引进燔祭和祭物就被允许了（参看<a href="922.htm">922</a>，<a href="1128.htm">1128</a>，<a href="1241.htm">1241</a>，<a href="1343.htm">1343</a>，<a href="2180.htm">2180</a>节）。</p>

To slay his son. That this signifies until whatever was from the merely human was dead, is evident from the internal sense of these words; for they signify the Lord's most grievous and inmost temptations, 
the last of which was that of the cross, in which it is evident that what was merely human also died. This could not be represented by Abraham's son or Isaac, because to sacrifice sons was an abomination; 
but it was represented so far as it could be, namely, even to the attempt, but not to the act. Hence it is evident that by these words, "Abraham took the knife to slay his son," is signified 
until all that was merely human was dead.  [2] That it was known from the most ancient time that the Lord was to come into the world, and was to suffer death, is evident from the fact that the custom 
prevailed among the Gentiles of sacrificing their sons, believing that they were thus purified, and propitiated to God; in which abominable custom they could not have placed their most important religious 
observance, unless they had learned from the ancients that the Son of God was to come, who would, as they believed, be made a sacrifice. To this abomination even the sons of Israel were inclined, 
and Abraham also; for no one is tempted except by that to which he is inclined. That the sons of Jacob were so inclined is evident in the Prophets; but lest they should rush into that abomination, 
it was permitted to institute burnt-offerings and sacrifices (see n. 922, 1128, 1241, 1343, 2180). </p>

'To slay his son' means until whatever originated in the merely human was dead. This becomes clear from the internal sense of these words, for they mean the Lord's severest and inmost temptations, in 
the last of which, that of the Cross, it is clear that the merely human also died. This could not be represented by 'Abraham's son' or Isaac because the sacrificing of sons was an abomination. Yet that 
death of the human was represented so far as this could be represented; that is to say, it was represented in the attempt to sacrifice Isaac but not in any actual sacrificing of him. From this it may 
become clear that these words about Abraham taking the knife to slay his son mean until all that was merely human was dead. </p>

<p><b>[2]</b>
 The Lord's future coming into the world and His suffering of death 
had been known since most ancient times. The existence of that knowledge then may be recognized plainly from the custom prevalent among the gentiles of sacrificing their own children, which they did 
in the belief that by so doing they made atonement and satisfied God. They would never have made this abominable custom their major religious activity unless they had received from the ancients knowledge 
of a future coming of the Son of God, of whom, so they believed, a sacrifice would be made. The children of Jacob too inclined to this abominable practice, as also did Abraham, for nobody is tempted 
except through that to which he has an inclination. The fact that the children of Jacob had those inclinations is clear in the Prophets. But to prevent them plunging into that abominable practice the 
introduction of burnt offerings and sacrifices was permitted, <a href="922.htm">922</a>, <a href="1128.htm">1128</a>, <a href="1241.htm">1241</a>, <a href="1343.htm">1343</a>, <a href="2180.htm">2180</a>. </p>

</p><b>2818.</b>
`Ad mactandum filium suum': quod significet usque dum mortuum quicquid ex mere humano, constare potest ex sensu interno horum verborum, significant enim gravissimas et intimas tentationes Domini, quarum 
ultima fuit crucis, in qua quod mere humanum etiam mortuum sit, constat; hoc non potuit repraesentari per `filium Abrahami' seu Jishakum quia sacrificare filios abominatio fuit, sed quantum potuit, 
repraesentatum fuit, nempe usque ad conatum, non autem ad actum; inde constare potest quod per haec verba quod `Abraham acceperit cultrum ad mactandum filium suum,' significetur usque dum mortuum sit 
omne mere humanum. Quod Dominus venturus in mundum, et quod passurus mortem, ab antiquissimo tempore notum fuisse, manifeste sciri potest ex eo quod invaluerit mos apud gentiles sacrificare liberos 
suos, sic credentes se expiari et propitiari Deo; in quo more abominabili non posuissent religiosissimum suum nisi acceperint ab Antiquis quod Filius Dei venturus sit, qui, ut credebant, sacrificium 
fieret; ad hanc abominationem etiam filii Jacobi inclinaverunt, et quoque Abraham, nemo enim tentatur nisi per id ad quod inclinat: quod filii Jacobi, constat apud Prophetas; sed ne in eam abominationem 
ruerent, permissum fuit holocausta et sacrificia instituere, videatur n. 922, 1128, 1241 1343, 2180.
