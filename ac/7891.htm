<h3 align="center" class="ired">属天的奥秘 第7891节</h3>
<h4 align="center"></h4><p><strong>7891.</strong>“头一日你们当有圣会”表一开始，所有人都必须在一起。这从“头一日”和“圣会”的含义清楚可知：“头一日”是指开始，即从那些侵扰的人，因而从诅咒当中释放的开始；“圣会”是指所有人都必须在一起的规定。召集会议是为了叫以色列全会众都聚集在一起，从而代表天堂；因为那时他们都被划分为支派，支派被划分为家族，家族又被划分为家庭。以色列人的各个支派、家族和家庭代表天堂和那里的社群（参看<a href="7836.htm">7836</a>节）。这就是这些会议被称为神圣并在每次节期上举办的原因（利未记<a href="http://39-27.cn/利23.27.htm">23:27</a>，<a href="http://39-27.cn/利23.36.htm">36</a>；民数记<a href="http://39-27.cn/民28.26.htm">28:26</a>；<a href="http://39-27.cn/民29.1.htm">29:1</a>，<a href="http://39-27.cn/民29.7.htm">7</a>，<a href="http://39-27.cn/民29.12.htm">12</a>）。这些节期本身由此被称为“圣会”，因为所有男丁都被吩咐出席这些圣会。“节期”（feasts）被称为“圣会”，这一点明显可见于摩西五经：<br />这是耶和华所定的节期，就是你们要宣告为圣会的。要将火祭献给耶和华。（利未记<a href="http://39-27.cn/利23.37.htm">23:37</a>）<br />在这些时候，所有男丁都要出席，这一点清楚可见于摩西五经：<br />你一切的男丁要在除酵节、七七节、住棚节，一年三次，在耶和华你神所选择的地方朝见祂。（申命记<a href="http://39-27.cn/申16.16.htm">16:16</a>）</p>

And there shall be to you in the first day a holy convocation. That this signifies that in the beginning all shall be together, is evident from the signification of "the first day," as being the beginning, 
namely, of liberation from those who have infested, and thus from damnation; and from the signification of "a holy convocation," as being that all shall be together. Convocations took place in 
order that the whole assemblage of Israel might be together, and might thus represent heaven; for they were then all distinguished into tribes, and the tribes into families, and the families into houses. 
(That heaven along with the societies there was represented by the tribes, the families, and the houses of the sons of Israel, see n. 7836.) Therefore those convocations were called holy, and took 
place at every feast (Lev. 23:27, 36; Num. 28:26; 29:1, 7, 12). From this the feasts themselves were called "holy convocations," for it was commanded that all the males should be present at them. That 
the feasts were called "holy convocations" is evident in Moses: </p>
<p>     These are the set feasts of Jehovah, which ye shall call holy convocations, to offer a fire-offering unto Jehovah (Lev. 23:37). That 
at such times all males were to be present, in the same: </p>
<p>     Three times in a year shall every male of thine appear together before Jehovah thy God, in the place which He shall choose; in the 
feast of unleavened things, and in the feast of weeks, and in the feast of tabernacles (Deut. 16:16). </p>

'And on the first day there shall be a holy convocation' means that at the beginning all must be together. This is clear from the meaning of 'the first day' as the beginning, that is to say, of the deliverance 
from those who have molested, and so from damnation; and from the meaning of 'a holy convocation' as the regulation that all must be together. The people were called to convocations in order 
that the whole of Israel might be assembled together and so represent heaven; for all were divided into tribes, tribes into families, and families into households. Regarding the representation of heaven 
and the communities there by the tribes, families, and households of the children of Israel, see <a href="7836.htm">7836</a>. Here was the reason why those convocations were called 'holy' and were held at each feast, <a href="http://bible.gospelcom.net/cgi-bin/bible?passage=Lev%2023:27,36&amp;version=ESV&amp;interface=print&amp;showfn=yes&amp;showxref">Lev 23:27,36</a>; <a href="http://bible.gospelcom.net/cgi-bin/bible?passage=Num%2028:26;%2029:1,%207,%2012&amp;version=ESV&amp;interface=print&amp;showfn=yes&amp;showxref">Num 28:26; 29:1, 7, 12</a>. And the feasts themselves were consequently called 'holy convocations', for all male persons were commanded to be present at them. The fact that the feasts were 
referred to as 'holy convocations' is clear in Moses, </p>
<blockquote>
These are the appointed feasts of Jehovah, which you shall call holy convocations, to present a fire-offering to Jehovah. <a href="http://bible.gospelcom.net/cgi-bin/bible?passage=Lev%2023:37&amp;version=ESV&amp;interface=print&amp;showfn=yes&amp;showxref">Lev 23:37</a>. 
</blockquote>
<p>The fact 
that all male persons were to be present on those occasions is clear in the same author, </p>
<blockquote>
Three times in the year all your male persons shall appear before Jehovah your God in the place which He 
will have chosen - at the feast of unleavened bread, at the feast of weeks, and at the feast of tabernacles. <a href="http://bible.gospelcom.net/cgi-bin/bible?passage=Deut%2016:16&amp;version=ESV&amp;interface=print&amp;showfn=yes&amp;showxref">Deut 16:16</a>.

`Et in die primo convocatio sancta': quod significet quod in principio omnes simul erunt, constat a significatione `diei primi' quod sit principium, nempe liberationis ab illis qui infestarunt, et {1}sic 
a damnatione; et ex significatione `convocationis sanctae' quod sit quod omnes simul erunt.  Convocationes fiebant ut una esset totus coetus Israelis, ac ita repraesentaret caelum, omnes enim tunc 
distincti erant in tribus, ac tribus in familias, et familiae in domos; quod repraesentaretur caelum cum societatibus ibi per tribus, familias, domos filiorum Israelis, videatur n. 7836; ideo convocationes 
illae dicebantur sanctae, et fiebant ad quodlibet festum, {2} Lev. xxiii 27, 36; Num. xxviii 26, xxix 1, 7, 12; {3}ex eo ipsa festa vocabantur `convocationes sanctae,' {4}nam mandatum ut omnes 
masculi in illis {5}adessent; quod festa dictae sint convocationes sanctae, constat apud Moschen, Haec festa stata Jehovae, quae vocabitis convocationes sanctas, ad offerendum ignitum Jehovae, Lev. 
xxiii 37: </p>
<p>quod tunc adessent omnes masculi, apud eundem, Tribus vicibus in anno comparebit omnis masculus tuus coram Jehovah Deo tuo, in loco quem elegerit, in festo azymorum, et in festo septimanarum,
