Verses 36-42. And Jacob was wroth, and chided with Laban; and Jacob answered and said to Laban, What is my trespass? What is my sin, in that thou hast hotly pursued after me? Whereas thou hast felt about 
all my vessels, what hast thou found of all the vessels of thy house? Set it here before my brethren and thy brethren, and let them judge between us two. These twenty years have I been with thee; 
thy sheep and thy she-goats have not cast their young, and the rams of thy flock have I not eaten. The torn I brought not unto thee, I bore the loss of it, from my hand didst thou require it, whether 
stolen by day or stolen by night. Thus I was; in the day the heat consumed me, and the cold in the night, and my sleep has been chased from mine eyes. These twenty years have I served thee in thy house, 
fourteen years for thy two daughters, and six years for thy flock, and thou hast changed my reward ten ways. Except the God of my father, the God of Abraham, and the Dread of Isaac, had been with 
me, surely now hadst thou sent me away empty. God hath seen my misery and the weariness of my hands, and judged yesternight.  "And Jacob was wroth, and chided with Laban," signifies the zeal of the natural; 
"and Jacob answered and said to Laban, What is my trespass? What is my sin, that thou hast hotly pursued after me?" signifies that it was not of evil that He separated Himself; "whereas thou hast 
felt about all my vessels, what hast thou found of all the vessels of thy house?" signifies that no truths of good had been his own, but all had been given; "set it here before my brethren and thy 
brethren, and let them judge between us two," signifies that there be judgment from what is just and equitable; "these twenty years have I been with thee," signifies His own; "thy sheep and thy she-goats 
have not cast their young," signifies its state as to good and the good of truth; "and the rams of thy flock have I not eaten," signifies the truth of good in that He had taken nothing of his; "the 
torn I brought not unto thee," signifies that evil not by His fault was with that good; "I bore the loss of it," signifies that good came of it; "from my hand didst thou require it," signifies that 
it was from Him; "whether stolen by day or stolen by night," signifies the evil of self-merit in like manner; "thus I was; in the day the heat consumed me, and the cold in the night, and my sleep has 
been chased from mine eyes," signifies temptations; "these twenty years have I served thee in thy house," signifies His own; "fourteen years for thy two daughters," signifies the first period in order 
that He might acquire to Himself therefrom the affections of truth; "and six years for thy flock," signifies that He might afterwards acquire good; "and thou hast changed my reward ten ways," signifies 
its state toward Him when He was applying these goods to Himself; "except the God of my father, the God of Abraham, and the Dread of Isaac, had been with me," signifies unless the Divine and the Divine 
Human; "surely now hadst thou sent me away empty," signifies that it would have claimed all things for itself; "God hath seen my misery and the weariness of my hands, and judged yesternight," signifies 
that all things were from Him by His own power. </p>

Verses 36-42 And Jacob was incensed and wrangled with Laban; and Jacob answered and said to Laban, What is my transgression, what is my sin, that you have hotly pursued after me? Because you have felt 
around all my vessels, what have you found belonging to all the vessels of your house? Put it here in front of my brothers and your brothers, and let them decide between the two of us. These twenty 
years I have been with you; your sheep and your she-goats have not miscarried, and I have not eaten the rams of your flock. That which was torn [by beasts] I did not bring to you; I myself bore the loss 
of it; from my hand you required it - that stolen by day and that stolen by night. This is how I was: By day the heat consumed me, and the cold by night; and my sleep was banished from my eyes. These 
twenty years I have served you in your house - fourteen years for your two daughters, and six years for your flock; and you have changed my wages in ten ways. Unless the God of my father, the God of 
Abraham and the Dread of Isaac, had been with me, you would now have sent me away empty-handed. My affliction and the tiredness of my hands<A name="fntext1"></a><A href="#fn1"><sup>a</sup></a> God has seen, and has given judgement last night. </p>
<p>'Jacob 
was incensed and wrangled with Laban' means the zeal of the natural. 'And Jacob answered and said to Laban, What is my transgression, what is my sin, that you have hotly pursued after me?' means that 
it was not because of evil that it had separated itself. 'Because you have felt all around my vessels, what have you found belonging to all the vessels of your house?' means that no truths had been 
that good's very own but all had been given. 'Put it here in front of my brothers and your brothers, and let them decide between the two of us' means that judgement should be made on the basis of that 
which is just and fair. 'These twenty years I have been with you' means the proprium. 'Your sheep and your she-goats have not miscarried' means its state as regards good and the good of truth. 'And 
I have not eaten the rams of your flock' means the truth of good, in that He took nothing of his. 'That which was torn [by beasts] I did not bring to you' means that evil for which He was not blameworthy 
resided with that good. 'I myself bore the loss of it' means that good came out of it. 'From my hand you required it' means that it came from Himself. 'That stolen by day and that stolen by night' 
means the evil of merit-seeking in a similar way. 'This is how I was: By day the heat consumed me, and the cold by night; and my sleep was banished from my eyes' means temptations. 'These twenty years 
I have served you in your house' means the proprium. 'Fourteen years for your two daughters' means the first period, the purpose of which was that He might acquire to Himself the affections for truth. 
'And six years for your flock' means the purpose of which was that He might acquire good after that. 'And you have changed my wages in ten ways' means its state towards Him when He was linking those 
goods to Himself. 'Unless the God of my father, the God of Abraham and the Dread of Isaac, had been with me' means but for the Divine and the Divine Human. 'You would now have sent me away empty-handed' 
means that it would have claimed all things to itself. 'My affliction and the tiredness of my hands God has seen, and has given judgement last night' means that all things were effected by Him by 
His own power.

Vers. 36-42.  Et succensuit Jacobo, et jurgatus est in Labanem; et respondit Jacob et dixit Labani, Quae praevaricatio mea, quod peccatum meum, quod insecutus es post me?  Quia contrectasti omnia 
vasa mea, quid invenisti ab omnibus vasis domus tuae? pone huc coram fratribus meis et fratribus tuis, et dijudicent inter ambos nos.  His viginti annis ego tecum; oves tuae et caprae tuae non abortiverunt, 
et arietes gregis tui non comedi.  Discerptum non adduxi ad te, ego indemnificavi id, e manu mea requisivisti id, furatum die et furatum nocte.  Fui, in die comedit me aestus et frigus in 
nocte, et expulsus somnus meus ab oculis meis.  His mihi viginti annis in domo tua servivi tibi, quatuordecim annis in duabus filiabus tuis, et sex annis in grege tuo, et mutavisti mercedem meam 
decem modis.  Nisi Deus patris mei, Deus Abrahami et pavor Jishaki, fuisset mihi, quod nunc vacuum misisses me; miseriam meam et fatigationem volarum mearum vidit Deus, et dijudicavit nocte praeterita. 
`Succensuit Jacobo, et jurgatus est in Labanem' significat zelum naturalis: `et respondit Jacob et dixit Labani, Quae praevaricatio mea, quod peccatum meum, quod insecutus es post me?' significat 
quod non ex malo separaverit se: `quia contrectasti omnia vasa mea, quid invenisti ab omnibus vasis domus tuae?' significat quod nulla vera boni ejus propria fuissent sed omnia data: `pone huc 
coram fratribus meis et fratribus tuis, et dijudicent inter ambos nos' significat quod ex justo et aequo sit judicium: `his viginti annis ego tecum' significat proprium: `oves tuae et caprae tuae non 
abortiverunt' significat statum ejus quoad bonum et bonum veri: `et arietes gregis tui non comedi' significat verum boni quod ex illius nihil sumpserit: `discerptum non adduxi ad te' significat 
quod malum non sua culpa apud illud bonum: `ego indemnificavi id' significat quod bonum inde: `e manu mea requisivisti id' significat quod ab Ipso: </p>
<p>`furatum die et furatum nocte' significat malum meriti 
similiter: </p>
<p>`fui, in die comedit me aestus, et frigus in nocte, et expulsus somnus meus ab oculis meis' significat tentationes: `his mihi viginti annis in domo tua servivi tibi' significat proprium: </p>
<p>`quatuordecim 
annis in duabus filiabus tuis' significat primam periodum ut sibi acquireret inde affectiones veri: `et sex annis in grege tuo' significat ut dein bonum: `et mutavisti mecredem 
meam decem modis' significat statum ejus ad se cum sibi applicaret bona illa: `nisi Deus patris mei, Deus Abrahami et pavor Jishaki, fuisset mihi' significat nisi Divinum e Divinum Humanum: `quod 
nunc vacuum misisses me' significat quod sibi omnia vindicavisset: </p>
<p>`miseriam meam et fatigationem volarum mearum vidit Deus, et dijudicavit nocte praeterita' significat quot omnia ab Ipso propria potentia. </p>
