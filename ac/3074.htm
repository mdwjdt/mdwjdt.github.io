<h3 align="center" class="ired">属天的奥秘 第3074节</h3>
<h4 align="center"></h4><p><strong>3074.</strong>从所给出的解释可在一定程度上看出这三节在内义上包含什么。由于这些事很分散，所以贯穿它们的思路无法显明，除非它们被集合起来，形成一个完整的观念，同时人的关注力从字义挪开。只要人的注意力停留在字义上，不但这个观念很混乱，而且心智也会持怀疑态度。心智越怀疑，就越处于模糊的状态。此处扼要描述了真理藉着记忆知识显现，通过它们被提升，从属世人中出来，然后进入理性人，并变成理性真理的过程（对主来说，这理性真理就是神性）。主的情况是：这一切通过圣爱进入人性的流注实现，拥有纯真在里面的对真理的情感就出自这人性。该流注光照属世人里面的记忆知识，并且那里的真理也变得可见，这些真理要被提升进入理性，在此与圣爱的良善结合。这些事在下文会有更详细的描述。不过，人若不知道每一个事物，甚至属世人里面的每一个事物，都是凭爱的流注，并由此凭拥有纯真在里面的情感而被排序，那么对前面和刚才所说的这些事就不可能有任何概念，即便有，也是一种极其模糊的概念。</p>

What is contained in these three verses in the internal sense, may in some measure be seen from the explication. But as these things are disconnected, that which they involve in their series cannot appear 
unless they are all collected together into a single idea, and the mental view is then withdrawn from the sense of the letter; for so long as the attention is there, not only is the idea confused, 
but the mind is also held in doubt; and so far as it is in doubt, it is obscured. A summary description is here given of the process in which truth appears by means of memory-knowledges, and is elevated 
from them out of the natural man into the rational, and becomes rational truth (in the Lord, Divine); namely, that this is effected by the influx of the Divine love into the Human, from which comes 
the affection of truth in which is innocence. By virtue of such an influx, the memory-knowledges in the natural man were enlightened, and the truths made their appearance that were to be elevated 
into the rational and there conjoined with the good of the Divine love. The same things are described more particularly in what follows. But he who does not know that all things in general and in particular 
are disposed, even in the natural man, by an influx of love, and from this of an affection in which there is innocence, can have but a very obscure idea, if any, of what was said above and of what 
has now been said. </p>

What these three verses contain in the internal sense may be seen to some small extent from the explanation given. Yet because their contents are diffuse, the line of thought which runs through them 
cannot be seen unless they are viewed collectively as one entire idea, and unless at the same time one moves one's attention away from the sense of the letter. As long as one's attention rests there one's 
entire idea is not only muddled but also subjected to doubt. And to the extent it is subjected to doubt the mind is enveloped in obscurity. Described here in summary form is the process of how truth 
comes to be seen by means of facts - of how it is raised up from those facts, out of the natural man into the rational man and becomes rational truth, which in the Lord's case was Divine. In His case 
it was effected by an influx of Divine Love into the Human, from which came the affection for truth having innocence within it. That influx threw light on the facts present in the natural man, and 
the truths there, which were to be raised up into the Rational and here joined to the Good of Divine love, became visible. These same considerations are described in greater detail in what follows. But 
anyone who does not know that every single thing, even in the natural man, is ordered by means of the influx of love, and from that, of affection that has innocence within it, can have none but a very 
obscure concept, if any at all, of the things stated above and now here. </p>

Quid in his tribus versibus in sensu interno continetur, aliquantisper videri potest ab explicatione; sed quia ea sparsa sunt, non apparere potest quid in serie involvunt, nisi in unam ideam collecta 
spectentur, et tunc removeatur intuitio a sensu litterae, quae quamdiu ibi est, non modo turbatur idea, sed etiam in dubio tenetur, et quantum in dubio, tantum obscuratur mens: describitur hic in summario 
processus quomodo per scientifica verum apparet, et hoc ab illis e naturali homine elevatur in rationalem, et fit verum rationale, in Domino Divinum; quod nempe factum per influxum Divini Amoris 
in Humanum, ex quo affectio veri in qua innocentia; ex tali influxu scientifica quae in naturali homine, illustrata sunt, et patuerunt vera quae in Rationale elevanda, et Bono Amoris Divini ibi conjungenda. 
 Haec eadem in sequentibus particularius describuntur; at qui non scit quod per influxum amoris, et ex eo affectionis in qua innocentia, omnia et singula disponantur, etiam in naturali homine, 
de his quae supra et nunc dicta sunt, non nisi quam obscurissimam ideam, si aliquam, habere potest. </p>
