There are two lights whereby man is enlightened-the light of the world, and the light of heaven. The light of the world is from the sun; the light of heaven is from the Lord. The light of the world is 
for the natural or external man, thus for those things which are in him, and although the things which are therein do not appear to be of this light, they nevertheless are so; for nothing can be comprehended 
by the natural man except by such things as come forth and appear in the solar world, thus except they have somewhat of form from the light and shade therein. All ideas of time and ideas of 
space, which are of so much account in the natural man that he cannot think without them, are also of the light of the world. But the light of heaven is for the spiritual or internal man. Man's interior 
mind, in which are his intellectual ideas that are called immaterial, is in this light. Man is unaware of this, although he calls his intellect sight, and ascribes light to it; the reason is that so 
long as he is in worldly and corporeal things he has a perception only of such things as are of the light of the world, but not of such things as are of the light of heaven; the light of heaven is from 
the Lord alone, and the universal heaven is in this light. [2] This light (namely, that of heaven) is immensely more perfect than the light of the world; the things which in the light of the world 
make one ray, in the light of heaven make myriads; within the light of heaven there are intelligence and wisdom. This light is that which flows into the light of the world which is in the external or 
natural man, and causes him to perceive sensuously the objects of actual things; and unless this light flowed in, man could not have any perception, for the things which are of the light of the world 
derive from it their life. Between these lights, or between the things which are in the light of heaven and those in the light of the world, there exists a correspondence when the external or natural 
man makes one with the internal or spiritual man, that is, when the former is subservient to the latter; and the things which then come forth in the light of the world are representative of such things 
as come forth in the light of heaven. </p>

<p align="center"><b>Elliott(1983-1999) 3223</b></p><p><b>3223.</b>
There are two forms of light that give light to man, the light of the world and the light of heaven. The light of the world comes from the sun, the light of heaven from the Lord. The light of the world 
is intended for the natural or external man, and so for things that exist within the natural man. Although these things do not appear to belong to that light, nevertheless they do, for the natural 
man is not able to grasp anything except by means of such things as occur and are visible in the world of the natural sun, thus unless they are given some visible form by the light and the shade of that 
world. All concepts of time and concepts of space, which in the natural man play so great a role that without them he is incapable of thought, belong also to the light of the world. The light of heaven 
however is intended for the spiritual or internal man. Man's interior mind, where his intellectual concepts reside that are called immaterial, belongs in that light. Of this no one is immediately 
conscious even though he refers to his intellect as sight and attributes light to it. The reason why he is not immediately conscious of it is that as long as he is engrossed in worldly and bodily interests 
his perception is solely of such things as belong to the light of the world and not of such as belong to the light of heaven. The light of heaven comes from the Lord alone, and the whole of heaven 
is bathed in that light. </p>

<p><b>[2]</b>
 This light - the light of heaven - is immeasurably more perfect than the light of the world. Things which in the light of the world make a single ray make myriads in 
the light of heaven. The light of heaven holds intelligence and wisdom within it. This is the light which flows into the light of the world which shines in the external or natural man and causes the 
latter to perceive things with the senses. Unless the light of heaven were flowing in a person would have no discernment at all, for the life present in things which belong to the light of the world 
is received from that inflowing light. Between these two forms of light - that is, between things that belong to the light of heaven and those that belong to the light of the world - a correspondence 
exists when the external or natural man makes one with the internal or spiritual man, that is, when the external man is subservient to the internal. In this case things that occur in the light of the 
world are representative of such as occur in the light of heaven. </p>

</p><b>3223.</b>
Sunt binae luces ex quibus illuminatur homo, lux mundi et lux caeli; lux mundi est a sole, lux caeli est a Domino; lux mundi est pro homine naturali seu externo, ita pro illis rebus quae sunt in illo; 
res quae ibi sunt, tametsi non apparent quod lucis illius sint, usque sunt, nam {1}a naturali homine nihil capi potest nisi per talia quae in mundo amari existunt et apparent, et sic nisi a luce ibi 
ac umbra aliquid formae {2}habent; omnes ideae temporis et ideae spatii quae in naturali homine tantum faciunt ut absque illis cogitare nequeat, etiam lucis mundi sunt: lux autem caeli pro homine (t)spirituali 
seu interno est; mens hominis interior, ubi ideae ejus intellectuales quae immateriales vocantur, in illa luce est; hoc nescit homo, tametsi {3}intellectum suum vocat visum, et ei adscribit 
lucem: causa est quia quamdiu in mundanis et corporeis est, modo perceptionem talium quae sunt lucis mundi, habet, non autem talium quae sunt lucis caeli; {4}lux caeli est a solo Domino; universum caelum 
in illa luce est.  [2] Haec lux nempe caeli immensum perfectior est luce mundi; quae in luce mundi faciunt suum radium, illa in luce caeli faciunt myriades; in luce caeli inest intelligentia et sapientia; 
illa lux est quae influit in lucem mundi quae in externo seu naturali homine, et facit ut is sensualiter objecta rerum percipiat; nisi illa lux influeret, nusquam homini aliqua apperceptio foret, 
nam illis quae luminis mundi sunt, vita inest inde. Inter illas luces, seu inter illa quae in luce caeli et in luce mundi sunt, datur correspondentia, quando externus seu naturalis homo suum facit 
cum interno seu spirituali, hoc est, cum ille huic inservit; et quae tunc existunt in luce mundi, sunt repraesentativa talium quae in luce caeli. @1 i quae ibi$  @2 habetur$ @3 intellectuale$  @4 
i at cum corporea et mundana apud illum cessant, tunc venit in lucem caeli;$  </p>
