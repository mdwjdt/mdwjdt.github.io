<h3 align="center" class="ired">属天的奥秘 第1568节</h3>
<h4 align="center"></h4><p><strong>1568.</strong>“那地容不下他们住在一起”表属于内在属天之物的事物无法与其它事物，也就是与此处“罗得”所表之物在一起。这从以下分析明显可知：如前所述，“亚伯兰”代表主，在此代表祂的内在人；而“罗得”代表祂的外在人，在此代表要与外在人分离，且无法与内在事物共居之物。外在人中还有很多无法与内在人共居的事物，诸如对良善的情感，以及源于此的快乐和乐趣；因为这些快乐和乐趣是内在人的良善及其喜乐和幸福的结果。当这些是结果时，它们完全对应起来，并且这时它们属于内在人，不属于外在人；因为如众所周知的，结果并非结果的产物，而是产生结果的原因的产物。例如，脸庞所闪耀的仁爱并非由脸庞产生，而是由里面的仁爱产生，是仁爱如此形成脸庞，并表现出这样的结果。再如，小孩子的纯真体现在他们的表情、举止、和彼此玩耍上，但这纯真本质上并不属于他们的表情或举止，而属于主通过他们的灵魂所流入的纯真；因此，纯真的表现是结果，其它一切情形也一样。<br />由此明显可知，外在人中有很多与内在人共居或一致的事物，但也有很多不一致，即无法与内在人共居的事物；这就是源于我欲和物欲的一切事物的情形，因为所有这些事物都视自我和这个世界为目的。而爱主与爱邻所具有的属天之物无法与这些事物一致，因为属天之物视主及其国度为目的，同样视属于祂及其国度的一切为目的。我欲和物欲的目的关注更为外在或低级之物，而爱主和爱邻的目的则关注更为内在或高级之物。由此明显可知，它们如此不和以至于无法共处。<br />要知道是什么使外在人与内在人对应和一致，又是什么造成不和，人只需反思占主导地位的目的，或也可说，占主导地位的爱；因为爱就是目的；凡被爱之物皆被视为目的。这种反思会表明一个人生命的性质和它死后的性质，因为它来自目的，或也可说来自形成其生命的主导爱；每个人的生命并非别的。与永生，即与属灵、属天的生命（这就是永生）不一致的事物若在世时未被除去，那么在来生必须被除去。但是，若它们无法被除去，那么这人就注定永远不幸。<br />现在提及这些事，是为了让人们知道，外在人中有与内在人一致的事物，也有不一致的事物；一致的事物无法与不一致的事物在一起；而且，外在人中一致的事物来自内在人，即经由内在人来自主；象散发仁爱的脸庞，或仁爱的脸，或象小孩子表情和举止中的纯真，如前所述。而不一致的事物则属于人和人自己的东西。由此可知这些话所表之义，即“那地容不下他们住在一起”。从内义上说，此处论述的是主，故也论述祂的一切样式和形像，如祂的国度，教会，其国度和教会里的每个人；正因如此，经上才在此阐述人里面的事物。在主凭自己的力量战胜邪恶，即魔鬼和地狱，从而使祂的人性本质也变得属天、神性，成为耶和华之前，属于祂的事物相对来说，就被视为那时祂所处的状态。</p><br />

<p><strong>[NCE]1568.</strong> The land could not sustain them, to [allow them to] live together, means that different aspects of his deeper, heavenly dimension could not coexist with those things, that is, with the things that Lot symbolizes here. To repeat, Abram represents the Lord 钬?here, his inner self. Lot, though, represents his outer self 钬?here, elements that needed to be separated from his outer self, since inward elements could not live together with them.<br />The outer self has many characteristics that the inner self can live with. Positive emotions and the pleasures and gratifications that rise out of them are an example, because they are effects of the inner self's good qualities and of its joys and blessings. When they are the effects of these things, they correspond to them perfectly, and then the inner rather than the outer self lays claim to them. After all, an effect results not from an effect but from an efficient cause, as is recognized.{*1} For example, when neighborly love shines out from the face, it is not the face that is responsible but the love lying within and so shaping the face and causing the effect. Again, the innocence present in the expression and gestures of little children and so in the games they play with each other is attributable not to their expression or gestures but to the innocence flowing in through their soul from the Lord. So these are effects. The same is true in all other cases. The logical conclusion, then, is that the outer self contains many elements that can live together or harmonize with the inner self.<br />[2] On the other hand, there are also many elements that are out of harmony, or that the inner self cannot live with. Take everything that wells up out of self-love and materialism. Anything from that source focuses on oneself and the world as its goal. With this goal the heavenly impulses of love for the Lord and love for one's neighbor are incompatible. The latter look to the Lord, and to his kingdom and everything belonging to him, as their goal.<br />Self-love and materialism look either out toward the surface or downward for their aims. Love for the Lord and love for our neighbor, though, look inward or upward for their aims. This leads to the conclusion that they clash too sharply ever to coexist.<br />[3] To learn what creates correspondence and agreement between your outer self and your inner, and what creates discord, simply consider what aims predominate, or to put it another way, what type of love predominates. (The different kinds of love we have are aims, since whatever we love is what we focus on as our aim.) From this you will see what kind of life you presently have, and what kind of life you will have after death. The goals or 钬?what is the same 钬?the types of love that predominate are what shape our life. No one's life is ever anything else.<br />If elements that clash with eternal life (in other words, with spiritual and heavenly life, which is eternal life) are not put aside during bodily life, they will have to be put aside in the other world. If they cannot be put aside, we cannot help being unhappy forever.<br />[4] The reason for saying these things is to show that the outer self has traits that are compatible with the inner self and traits that are incompatible, and that compatible traits can never coexist with incompatible ones. They also show that compatible elements in the outer self come from the inner self, or rather from the Lord through the inner self, like a face that beams with charity 钬?a face of charity 钬?or like the innocence in a child's expression and gestures, as noted. Incompatible elements, though, belong to us and our demand for self-governance. This clarifies what it means that the land could not sustain them, to [allow them to] live together.<br />In an inner sense, this verse deals with the Lord, and since it deals with the Lord, it also deals with every likeness and image of him. To specify, it speaks of his kingdom, the church, and every person in his kingdom or church. So it depicts the way things stand with us humans. The way things stood with the Lord 钬?before he had completely overcome evil (the Devil and hell) by his own might and in so doing become heavenly, divine, and Jehovah even in regard to his human quality 钬?depends on what phase he was in.<br /><br /><strong>Footnotes:</strong><br />{*1} The phrase "efficient cause" here is a reference to the theory of causation adopted by Aristotle and the medieval Scholastic philosophers. Aristotle introduced the four main categories of cause (Physics 194b-195b); they can be described in simplistic terms with respect to an artifact such as a statue that is being carved from stone. The material cause is what the artifact is made of, the stone. The efficient cause is the agent that makes the artifact, the sculptor. The formal cause is the quality gained by the material that is being made into the sculpture, its "statueness." The final cause is the purpose for which the statue is made. The efficient cause is closest to what is generally understood as a cause in current usage. [JSR, RS] </p>

The land was not able to bear them that they might dwell together. This signifies that the things belonging to the internal celestial things could not be together with the others, that is, with those 
here signified by "Lot." Abram, as before said, represents the Lord, here His internal man; but Lot represents His external man, here the things that were to be separated from the external man, with 
which the internal things could not dwell.  There are many things in the external man with which the internal man can dwell, such as affections of good, and the delights and pleasures thence originating; 
for these are the effects of the goods of the internal man, and of its joys and happiness; and when they are the effects, they altogether correspond; and they are then of the internal man and not 
of the external. For the effect, as is known, is not of the effect, but of the effecting cause; as, for example, the charity which shines forth from the face is not of the face, but is of the charity 
that is within, and which so forms the face, and presents the effect; or as the innocence of little children that shows itself in their looks, gestures, and play with each other, is not of the countenance 
or the gesture, but is of the innocence of the Lord that flows in through their souls; so that the manifestations of innocence are effects; and it is the same in all other cases.  [2] From this 
it is evident that there are many things in the external man that can dwell together and agree with the internal man. But there are also very many which do not agree, or together with which the internal 
man cannot dwell; this is the case with all things that spring from the love of self, and from the love of the world, for all such things regard self as the end, and the world as the end. With these 
the celestial things which are of love to the Lord and love toward the neighbor cannot agree; for these look to the Lord as the end, and to His kingdom and all things that are of Him and His kingdom 
as the ends. The ends of the love of self and the love of the world look outward or downward; but the ends of love to the Lord and love toward the neighbor look inward or upward; from all which it is 
evident that they disagree so much that they cannot possibly be together.  [3] That it may be known what makes the correspondence and agreement of the external man with the internal, and what makes 
the disagreement, one needs only to reflect upon the ends which reign; or what is the same, upon the loves which reign; for the loves are the ends; for whatever is loved is looked to as the end. It will 
thus be evident of what quality the life is, and what it will be after death; for, from the ends, or what is the same, from the loves which reign, the life is formed; the life of every man is nothing 
else. The things that disagree with eternal life-that is, with spiritual and celestial life, which is eternal life-if not removed in the life of the body, must be removed in the other life; and if 
they cannot be removed, the man cannot be otherwise than unhappy to eternity.  [4] These things are now said that it may be known that there are things in the external man which agree with the internal 
man, and things which disagree; and that those which agree cannot possibly be together with those that disagree; and further, that the things in the external man which agree, are from the internal 
man, that is, through the internal man from the Lord; like a face that beams from charity, or a face of charity; or like the innocence in the countenance and gestures of little children, as before said. 
But the things which disagree are of the man and what is his own. From what has been said it may be known what is signified by the words, "the land was not able to bear them that they might dwell 
together." In the internal sense, the Lord is here treated of; and because the Lord, every likeness and image of Him is also treated of-His kingdom, the church, and every man of His kingdom or church; 
and it is for this reason that the things which are in men are here set forth. The things appertaining to the Lord, before He from His own power overcame evil, that is, the devil and hell, and so became 
celestial, Divine, and Jehovah, as to His Human essence also, are to be considered relatively to the state in which He then was. </p>

<p align="center"><b>Elliott(1983-1999) 1568</b></p><p><b>1568.</b>
That 'the land was unable to bear them, that they might dwell together' means that the things which belonged to the celestial internals could not remain together with the former ones, that is to say, 
with those things meant here by 'Lot', is evident from the following considerations: 'Abram', as has been stated, represents the Lord, and at this point His Internal Man, while 'Lot' represents the external, 
and at this point the things that had to be separated from the external Man, with which things internals could not dwell together. In the external man there are many things with which the internal 
man is able to dwell together, such as affections for good and the delights and pleasures arising from them, for those delights and pleasures are the effects of the goods of the internal man and 
of his joys and happiness. When these are the effects they correspond perfectly, for in that case they belong to the internal man and not to the external man. For an effect, as is well known, is not 
the product of an effect but of an efficient cause. Take, for example, charity: when this shines out of the face, it is produced not by the face but by the charity within that so controls the face and 
produces the effect. Or take, for example, the innocence seen in the expressions on small children's faces, in the ways they act, and so in the games they play with one another: that innocence does not 
belong essentially to their expressions or actions but is derived from innocence from the Lord which flows in through their souls. Thus their expressions and actions are effects; so also with every 
other example taken. </p>
<p></p>
<p><b>[2]</b>
 From these considerations it is clear that many things exist with the external man which are able to dwell or accord with the internal. But there are also many things which 
do not accord, that is, with which the internal man is unable to dwell, namely all that streams forth from self-love and love of the world; for everything resulting from these loves regards self or 
the world as its end in view. With these, celestial things that go with love to the Lord and love towards the neighbour cannot agree, for celestial things regard the Lord as the end in view, and His kingdom 
and all that belongs to Him and His kingdom similarly as ends. The ends which self-love and love of the world have in view look to things of a more external or lower kind, whereas those which love 
to the Lord and love towards the neighbour have in view look to things of a more internal or higher kind. From these considerations it becomes clear that they are too discordant ever to remain together. </p>
<p></p>
<p><b>[3]</b>
To know what produces a correspondence and agreement of the external man with the internal and what produces disagreement one has only to reflect on the ends, or what amounts to the same, 
on the loves by which one is ruled; for people's loves constitute the ends they have in view, indeed whatever is loved by them is looked upon as an end. Such reflexion will show what one's life is really 
like and what it will be like after death, since it is from a person's ends, or what amounts to the same, his ruling loves, that his life is formed. The life of each individual is never otherwise. 
If the things which do not agree with eternal life, that is, with spiritual and celestial life - which is eternal life - are not removed during a person's lifetime they have to be removed in the next 
life. But if they are irremovable that person is bound to be unhappy for ever. </p>
<p></p>
<p><b>[4]</b>
 These things have now been mentioned so that it may be known that in the external man there are things which agree 
with the internal and things which do not, that those which do agree cannot possibly remain together with those that do not, and also that those things in the external man which do agree come from 
the internal man, that is, from the Lord by way of the internal man; as for example, in the case of a face radiant with charity, or a charitable face, or in the case of the innocence seen in the expressions 
on the faces and in the actions of young children, as has been stated. The things which do not accord however belong to man and his proprium. From this one may know what 'the land was unable to 
bear them, that they might dwell together' means. Here, in the internal sense, the Lord is the subject; and since the Lord is the subject so also is every likeness and image of Him, namely His kingdom, 
the Church, and every member of that kingdom or of the Church; and therefore here the things residing with men are presented. These same things that resided with the Lord before He overcame evil, 
that is, the devil and hell, by His Own power, and so became celestial, Divine, and Jehovah even as to His Human Essence, must be seen in relation to His state at that time. </p>

Quod 'non ferebat illos terra ad habitandum simul' significet quod illa quae sunt caelestium internorum non possent simul esse cum illis, nempe cum illis quae per 'Lotum' hic significantur: 'Abram,' 
ut dictum, repraesentat Dominum, hic Internum Ipsius Hominem, 'Lotus' autem externum, hic quae ab Externo Homine separanda, cum quibus Interna cohabitare non possent: sunt in externo homine plura cum 
quibus internus potest cohabitare, sicut affectiones boni et inde oriundae jucunditates et voluptates, nam hae sunt effectus bonorum interni hominis et ejus gaudiorum et felicitatum, quae cum sunt effectus, 
prorsus correspondent, et tunc sunt interni hominis, non externi; nam effectus, ut notum, non est effectus sed causae efficientis, ut pro exemplo, charitas quae elucet ex facie, non est faciei 
sed est charitatis quae intus et sic format faciem et sistit effectum; aut sicut innocentia apud infantes quae in illorum vultu, gestibus, et sic in ludis mutuis inter se; non est vultus aut gestuum 
sed est innocentiae a Domino quae per animam illorum influit; ita sunt effectus; sic in omnibus reliquis;  [2] ex his constat quod multa dentur apud externum hominem quae cohabitare seu concordare possunt 
cum interno: sed sunt quoque plura quae non concordant, seu cum quibus cohabitare nequit internus homo, ut sunt omnia quae scaturiunt ab amore sui et ab amore mundi; nam omnia quae sunt inde, spectant 
se ut finem, et mundum ut finem; cum his caelestia quae sunt amoris in Dominum et amoris erga proximum, concordare nequeunt; quippe haec spectant Dominum ut finem, et regnum Ipsius, et omnia quae 
sunt Ipsius et regni Ipsius, ut fines: fines amoris sui et amoris mundi spectant extrorsum aut deorsum; fines autem amoris in Dominum et amoris erga proximum spectant introrsum aut sursum; ex quibus 
constare potest quod tantum discordent ut nusquam possint simul esse:  [3] ut sciatur quid facit correspondentiam et concordantiam externi hominis cum interno et quid facit discordantiam, reflectatur 
solum super fines qui regnant, seu quod idem est, super amores qui regnant; nam amores sunt fines, quicquid enim amatur, hoc spectatur ut finis, ita constabit qualis vita est et qualis futura post mortem; 
nam ex finibus, seu quod idem est, ex amoribus qui regnant, formatur vita; vita cujusvis hominis nusquam aliud est: quae discordant cum vita aeterna, hoc est, cum vita spirituali et caelesti, quae 
est vita aeterna, si non removentur in vita corporis, removenda sunt in altera vita; quae si non removeri possunt, nusquam potest homo aliter quam infelix esse in aeternum. [4] Haec nunc dicta sunt 
ut sciatur quod in externo homine sint quae cum interno concordant et quae discordant, et quod illa quae concordant nusquam possunt simul esse cum illis quae discordant; tum quod tua quae in externo 
homine concordant, sint ab interno homine, hoc est, per internum hominem a Domino, sicut facies quae elucet a charitate, seu facies charitatis, aut innocentia in infantum vultu et gestibus, ut dictum; 
at quae discordant, sunt hominis et ejus proprii; inde sciri potest quid significat quod 'non ferret illos terra ad habitandum simul.' Hic in sensu interno de Domino agitur, et quia de Domino, etiam 
de omni Ipsius similitudine et imagine, nempe, de regno Ipsius, de Ecclesia, de omni homine regni seu Ecclesiae, quare sistuntur hic illa quae apud homines; quae apud Dominum, antequam ex propria potentia 
evicerit malum, hoc est, diabolum et infernum, ac ita caelestis, Divinus, et Jehovah quoque factus quoad Humanam Essentiam, se habent praedicate ad statum in quo fuit. </p>
