<h4 align="center"></h4><p><strong>338.</strong>创世记4:1 那人和他妻子夏娃同房，夏娃就怀孕，生了该隐，她说：“我得了一个人（男性），耶和华。”<br />“那人和他妻子”表上古教会，这一点已众所周知。它的第一个后代或长子，就是信，在此被称为“该隐”。她说：“我得了一个人（男性），耶和华”表示对那些被称为“该隐”者而言，信单独作为某个事物被识别和承认。</p>

And the human knew Eve, his wife, and she conceived and delivered Cain; and she said, "I have acquired a man: Jehovah."<br />The human and his wife, Eve, symbolize the earliest church, as is known. His firstborn or first offspring is faith, which is called Cain here. She said, "I have acquired the man Jehovah," means that faith among those called Cain was recognized and acknowledged as a thing in itself. </p>

Verse l. And the man knew Eve his wife, and she conceived, and bare Cain, and said, I have gotten a man [vir], Jehovah. By the "man and Eve his wife" is signified the Most Ancient Church, as has been 
made known; its first offspring, or firstborn, is faith, which is here called "Cain;" her saying "I have gotten a man, Jehovah" signifies that with those called "Cain" faith was recognized and acknowledged 
as a thing by itself. </p>

Verse 1 And the man knew Eve his wife, and she conceived and bore Cain; and she said, I have gained a man, Jehovah'.<A name="fntext1"></a><A href="#fn1"><sup>a</sup></a> </p>
<p>'The man and Eve his wife' means the Most Ancient Church, as is well known. Its 
first offspring, or firstborn, is faith, which is here called 'Cain'. 'She said, I have gained a man, Jehovah' means that with those called Cain faith was known and acknowledged as something existing 
by itself.

Vers.  I.  Et homo cognovit Havam uxorem suam, et concepit et peperit Cain; et dixit, Acquisivi virum, Jehovam.  Per 'hominem et Havam uxorem ejus' significatur Ecclesia Antiquissima, ut notum: ejus 
prima proles seu primogenitum est fides, quae hic vocatur 'Cain': 'quod dixerit, Acquisivi virum, Jehovam' significat quod fides apud eos qui dicti Cain, cognita sit et agnita sicut res per se. </p>
