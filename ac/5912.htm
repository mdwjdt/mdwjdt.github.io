<h3 align="center" class="ired">属天的奥秘 第5912节</h3>
<h4 align="center"></h4><p><strong>5912.</strong>“你和你的儿子、儿子的儿子”表属灵良善和从它衍生的一切事物，以及从这些事物衍生的一切事物。这从以色列的代表，以及他的“儿子”和“儿子的儿子”的含义清楚可知：以色列，即此处的“你”是指属灵良善，如前所述（<a href="5906.htm">5906</a>节）；他的“儿子”是指从该良善衍生之物，也就是由他的“儿子们”所代表的属世层中的真理；“儿子的儿子”是指从这些事物衍生的事物，即再次生出和衍生的真理。因为当良善占据首位并掌权时，它便不断产生真理。它在自己周围，也在每个真理周围使它们增多，并使每个真理都像一颗小星星，中间的闪着亮光。这良善不仅使自己周围的真理增多，还通过连续衍生从这些真理进一步产生真理，也就是“儿子的儿子”，或孙子，以及他们之后的等等。约瑟若不通过他的父亲就无法邀请他的弟兄们到他这里来，因为他说，他的父亲和他的儿子、儿子的儿子要一起来。原因在于，内在属天层与属世层中的真理若不通过居间层就没有结合。</p>

Thou, and thy sons, and thy sons' sons. That this signifies spiritual good and all things that are from it and that are from these, is evident from the representation of Israel, who here is "thou," as 
being spiritual good (of which above, n. 5906); from the signification of "his sons," as being the things that are from this good, which are truths in the natural, and are represented by his sons; and 
from the signification of "sons' sons," as being the things that are from these, namely, the truths again born and derived. For when good is in the first place, and has dominion, it continually produces 
truths. It multiplies them around itself and also around each truth, and makes each truth like a little star, in the center of which there is a bright light. Nor does good only multiply truths around 
itself, but it also produces truths from truths by derivations in succession, which are the "sons' sons," or grandsons; and so on. Joseph invites his brethren to him no otherwise than through his 
father, saying that he should come with his sons and with his sons' sons. The reason is, that there is no conjunction of the internal celestial with truths in the natural except through the intermediate. </p>

'You and your sons, and the sons of your sons' means spiritual good, and all derivatives from it, and further derivatives from these. This is clear from the representation of Israel, to whom 'you' refers 
here, as spiritual good, dealt with above in <a href="5906.htm">5906</a>; from the meaning of 'his sons' as derivatives from that good, that is, the truths in the natural which are represented by 'his sons'; and from the 
meaning of 'the sons of his sons' as derivatives from these, that is to say, further truths so born and derived. For when good occupies the first place and has dominion, it is constantly bringing forth 
truths. It then multiplies these around itself and also around each truth, making each truth like a star, the middle of which is shining brightly. But that good does not merely multiply the truths 
around itself; it also brings forth from those truths further truths by means of successive derivations, which are 'the sons of sons' or grandsons, and so on after them. Joseph did not invite his brothers 
to join him except through their father; for he said that his father was to come with his sons and sons' sons. The reason for this is that the joining of the internal celestial to the truths in 
the natural has no existence except through the intermediary. </p>

`Tu et filii tui, et filii filiorum tuorum': quod significet bonum spirituale, et omnia quae ab illo, et qua ab his, constat ex repraesentatione `Israelis' qui hic est `tu', quod sit bonum spirituale, 
de qua supra n. 5906; ex significatione `filiorum ejus' quod sint quae ab illo, et sunt vera in naturali quae repraesentantur per `filios ejus'; et ex significatione `filiorum filiorum ejus' quod sint 
quae ab his, nempe vera iterum nata et derivata; bonum enim cum primo loco est et dominium habet, producit vera {1}continue; multiplicat illa circum se et quoque circum unumquodvis verum, et facit 
unumquodvis verum sicut stellulam in cujus medio est luminosum; bonum nec modo multiplicat vera circum se, sed etiam producit a veris vera per derivationes successive, quae sunt `filii filiorum' seu 
nepotes, et sic porro. (m)Joseph fratres suos non aliter ad se invitat quam per patrem, dicendo quod is cum filiis et filiis filiorum veniret; causa est quia conjunctio caelestis interni cum veris in 
naturali non datur nisi quam per medium {2}.(n) @1 continuo I$ @2 i quod nunc est bonum spirituale, quod Israel$ </p>
