<h3 align="center" class="ired">属天的奥秘 第450节</h3>
<h4 align="center"></h4><p><strong>450.</strong>有些人在世时看似比其他人更深受圣言启迪。但他们对天堂的设想却如此虚假，以至于他们以为自己会被高高举起，进入天堂，从那里统治下面的事物，从而荣耀显赫，高人一等。鉴于这等人抱有这种谬见，为让他们知错，于是他们被举到高处，被允许从那里在某种程度上统治下面的事物。令他们羞愧的是，他们开始意识到这样的天堂只是一个妄想，真正的天堂不是高高在上，而是在拥有爱与仁者所在的地方，也就是在那些心有主的国度之人那里。天堂也不在于想要变得多么显赫，因为渴望比其他人更大不是天堂，而是地狱。</p>

<p><strong>[NCE]450.</strong> Some, who in the world had seemed more enlightened concerning the Word than others, had latched onto such a false conception of heaven that they thought they could go to heaven just by going up. They imagined that from their height they would be able to govern everything below, so they thought they would be allowed to bask in self-glorification and in their superiority over others.{*1} In order for them to see the error of their thinking, they were raised up on high — such being their fantasy — and were permitted some governance over things below. But they found to their shame that this heaven was an illusion. They discovered that heaven does not consist in altitude but exists wherever people have love and charity (or the Lord's kingdom) inside them, and that it does not involve the desire to be superior to others. The wish to be greater than others is not heaven but hell.<br /><br /><strong>Footnotes:</strong><br />{*1} There is an echo in this passage of the dispute among the disciples about "which of them should be the greatest" (<a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_450/bible_king-james-version_mark_9_33-35" target=_top>Mark 9:33-35</a>; <a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_450/bible_king-james-version_luke_22_24-26" target=_top>Luke 22:24-26</a>; see note 1 in <a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_450/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_452" target=_top>452</a>).

Some who during their abode in this world had seemed to be preeminently enlightened in regard to the Word, had conceived so false an idea about heaven that they supposed themselves to be in heaven when 
they were high up, and imagined that from that position they could rule all things below, and thus be in self-glory and preeminence over others. On account of their being in such a phantasy, and in 
order to show them that they were in error, they were taken up on high, and from there were permitted in some measure to rule over things below; but they discovered with shame that this was a heaven 
of phantasy, and that heaven does not consist in being on high, but is wherever there is anyone who is in love and charity, or in whom is the Lord's kingdom; and that neither does it consist in desiring 
to be more eminent than others, for to desire to be greater than others is not heaven, but hell. </p>

There were some who seemed in the world to be more enlightened in the Word than anybody else. They had conceived so false an idea of heaven that they imagined they would be in heaven when they were high 
up, and that from that position they would be able to rule the things below, and so be in their glory and be pre-eminent. Because they entertained such a false notion, and in order that they might 
know how mistaken they were, they were conveyed up high and from there they were allowed to rule to some extent over things below. Then, to their shame, they began to realize that this heaven was a delusion 
and that heaven did not consist in being high up, but that it existed wherever the individual was in whom love and charity abided, that is, who had the Lord's kingdom within himself. Nor did it 
consist in wishing to be pre-eminent, for wishing to be greater than others is not heaven, but hell.  </p>

</p><b>450.</b>
Quidam qui quoque visi in mundo prae aliis illustrati in Verbo, tam falsam conceperunt ideam de caelo quod putarent se esse in caelo cum in alto, et quod regere possent inde quae infra, ita esse in 
gloria sui, et eminenti prae aliis: illi quia tali phantasia erant, ut scirent quod in falso essent, sublati sunt in altum, et inde aliquid regere in inferioribus permissum; sed animadvertebant cum pudore 
quod hoc esset phantasiae caelum; et quod caelum non consisteret in alto, sed ubicumque is qui in amore et charitate est, seu in quo regnum Domini, nec velle eminere prae aliis: nam major velle esse 
aliis, non est caelum sed est infernum. </p>
