He who is in charity toward the neighbor from internal affection is a charity toward the neighbor in everything which he thinks and speaks, and which he wills and does. It can be said that as to his 
interiors a man or an angel is a charity when good is to him the neighbor. So widely does charity toward the neighbor extend.            EXODUS 14 </p>
<p>     1. And Jehovah spake unto Moses, saying,   
    2. Speak unto the sons of Israel, that they turn back and encamp before Pi-hahiroth, between Migdol and the sea, before Baal-zephon: over against it shall ye encamp by the sea.      3. And Pharaoh 
will say of the sons of Israel, They are entangled in the land, the wilderness hath shut upon them.      4. And I will harden Pharaoh's heart, and he shall follow after them; and I will be glorified 
in Pharaoh, and in all his army; and the Egyptians shall know that I am Jehovah. And they did so.      5. And it was told the king of Egypt that the people fled; and the heart of Pharaoh and of his 
servants was turned against the people, and they said, What is this we have done, that we have let Israel go from serving us?      6. And he harnessed his chariot, and took his people with him: </p>
<p>  
   7. And he took six hundred chosen chariots, and all the chariots of Egypt, and tertian captains upon all of them.      8. And Jehovah hardened the heart of Pharaoh king of Egypt, and he pursued after 
the sons of Israel; and the sons of Israel went out with a lofty hand.      9. And the Egyptians pursued after them, and overtook them encamping by the sea, all the horses of the chariots of Pharaoh, 
and his horsemen, and his army, beside Pi-hahiroth before Baal-zephon.      10. And Pharaoh drew nigh, and the sons of Israel lifted up their eyes, and behold the Egyptian marching after them, and 
they were sore afraid; and the sons of Israel cried unto Jehovah.      11. And they said unto Moses, are there no graves in Egypt, that thou hast taken us to die in the wilderness? Why hast thou done 
this to us, to lead us forth out of Egypt?      12. Is not this the word that we spake unto thee in Egypt, saying, Cease from us, and let us serve the Egyptians? because it is good for us to serve 
the Egyptians, rather than that we should die in the wilderness.      13. And Moses said unto the people, Fear ye not, stand still, and see the salvation of Jehovah, which He will do for you today; 
for the Egyptians whom ye have seen today, ye shall see them again no more forever.      14. Jehovah shall wage war for you, and ye shall keep silence.      15. And Jehovah said unto Moses, Why criest 
thou unto Me? speak unto the sons of Israel, that they set forward.      16. And thou, lift up thy rod, and stretch out thy hand over the sea, and cleave it asunder; and the sons of Israel shall 
come into the midst of the sea on the dry.      17. And I, behold I will harden the heart of the Egyptians, and they shall come after them; and I will be glorified in Pharaoh, and in all his army, in 
his chariots, and in his horsemen.      18. And the Egyptians shall know that I am Jehovah, when I am glorified in Pharaoh, in his chariots, and in his horsemen.      19. And the angel of God set out, 
marching before the camp of Israel, and he went behind them; and the pillar of cloud set out from before them and stood behind them: </p>
<p>     20. And it came between the camp of the Egyptians and the 
camp of Israel; and it was a cloud and darkness, and it lighted up the night; and the one came not near the other all the night.      21. And Moses stretched out his hand over the sea; and Jehovah made 
the sea go away by a strong east wind all the night, and made the sea dry, and the waters were cleft asunder.      22. And the sons of Israel came into the midst of the sea in the dry; and the waters 
were a wall to them on their right hand, and on their left.      23. And the Egyptians pursued, and came after them, all Pharaoh's horses, his chariots, and his horsemen, into the midst of the sea.  
    24. And it was in the morning watch, and Jehovah looked forth to the camp of the Egyptians in the pillar of fire and of cloud, and troubled the camp of the Egyptians.      25. And He took off 
the wheel of his chariots, and he drew it in heaviness; and the Egyptian said, I will flee before Israel; because Jehovah wageth war for them against the Egyptians.      26. And Jehovah said unto 
Moses, Stretch out thy hand over the sea, and let the waters return upon the Egyptians, upon his chariots, and upon his horsemen.      27. And Moses stretched out his hand over the sea, and the sea returned 
at the turn of the morning to the strength of its flow; and the Egyptians fled to meet it; and Jehovah shook out the Egyptians into the midst of the sea.      28. And the waters returned, and 
covered the chariots, and the horsemen, even all the army of Pharaoh that came after them into the sea; there was not left of them even one.      29. And the sons of Israel went on the dry into the 
midst of the sea; and the waters were a wall to them on their right hand, and on their left.      30. And Jehovah saved Israel on this day out of the hand of the Egyptians; and Israel saw the Egyptians 
dead upon the seashore.      31. And Israel saw the great hand which Jehovah wrought on the Egyptians, and the people feared Jehovah; and they believed in Jehovah, and in His servant Moses. </p>

With a person who is governed by charity towards the neighbour that is kindled by inward affection, charity towards the neighbour exists in every detail of his thought and speech, and of his will and 
actions. The interiors of a person or of an angel, when good is his neighbour, can be called charity. So wide is the scope of charity towards the neighbour. </p>

Qui in charitate erga proximum est ex affectione interna, in singulis ejus quae cogitat et loquitur, ac quae vult et agit, est charitas erga proximum; dici potest quod homo {1} seu angelus quoad interiora 
sua sit charitas, cum bonum ei est proximus.  Tam late se extendit charitas erga proximum. 	@1 i talis$ {1}CAPUT XIV 	@1 i Exodi$ 	1.  Et locutus est JEHOVAH ad Moschen, dicendo, 	2.  Loquere 
ad filios Israelis, et revertantur et castrametentur ante Pi-Chiroth, inter Migdal et inter mare, ante Baal-Zephon, e regione ejus castrametemini juxta mare. 	3.  Et dicet Pharao de filiis Israelis, 
Perplexi illi in terra, conclusit super illos desertum. 	4.  Et indurabo cor Pharaonis, et persequetur post illos, et glorificabor in Pharaone et in omni exercitu illius; et scient Aegyptii quod 
Ego JEHOVAH: et fecerunt ita. 	5.  Et indicatum regi Aegypti quod fugeret populus; et conversum est cor Pharaonis et servorum illius contra populum, et dixerunt, Quid hoc fecimus, quod dimiserimus Israelem 
a serviendo nobis? 	6.  Et alligavit currum suum, et populum suum sumpsit secum. 	7.  Et sumpsit sescentos currus electos, et omnes currus Aegypti; et tertiani duces super omnes illius. 	8. 
 Et induravit JEHOVAH cor Pharaonis regis Aegypti, et persecutus post filios Israelis; et filii Israelis exeuntes manu excelsa. 	9.  Et persecuti Aegyptii post illos, et assecuti illos castrametantes 
juxta mare, omnes equi curruum Pharaonis, et equites illius, et exercitus illius, juxta (x)Pi-Chiroth ante Baal-Zephon. 	10.  Et Pharao appropinquavit; et sustulerunt filii Israelis oculos suos, et 
ecce Aegyptius proficiscens post illos; et timuerunt valde, et clamaverunt filii Israelis ad JEHOVAH. 	11.  Et dixerunt ad Moschen, Numne nulla sepulcra in Aegypto, sumpsisti nos ad moriendum in deserto? 
quid hoc fecisti nobis, ad educendum nos ex Aegypto? 	12.  Nonne hoc verbum quod locuti sumus ad te in Aegypto, dicendo, Cessa a nobis, et serviamus Aegyptiis, quia bonum nobis servire Aegyptiis 
prae mori nos in deserto? 	13.  Et dixit Moscheh ad populum, Ne timeatis, consistite, et videte salutem JEHOVAH quam faciet vobis hodie; quia quos videtis Aegyptios hodie, non addetis videre illos amplius 
usque in saeculum. 	14.  JEHOVAH militabit pro vobis, et vos taceatis. 	15.  Et dixit JEHOVAH ad Moschen, Quid clamas ad Me? loquere ad filios Israelis, et proficiscantur. 	16.  Et tu tolle 
baculum tuum, et extende manum tuam super mare, et diffinde illud, et veniant filii Israelis in medium maris in arido. 	17.  Et Ego, ecce Ego indurans cor Aegyptiorum, et venient post illos, et glorificabor

et a sinistra illorum. 	23.  Et persecuti Aegyptii, et venerunt post illos omnes equi Pharaonis, currus illius, et equites illius, ad medium maris. 	24.  Et fuit in custodia matutina, et prospexit 
JEHOVAH ad castra Aegyptiorum in columna ignis et nubis, et perturbavit castra Aegyptiorum. 	25.  Et dimovit rotam curruum illius, et duxit illam in gravitate; et dixit Aegyptius, Fugiam coram Israele,

 Et extendit Moscheh manum suam super mare, et reversum est mare ad vergere mane, ad vim fluxus sui, et Aegyptii fugientes obviam ei, et excussit JEHOVAH Aegyptios in medium mare. 	28.  Et reversae

mortuos super litore maris. 	31.  Et vidit Israel manum magnam quam fecit JEHOVAH in Aegyptiis; et timuerunt populus JEHOVAM, et crediderunt in JEHOVAM, et in Moschen servum Ipsius. </p>
