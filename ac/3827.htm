<h3 align="center" class="ired">属天的奥秘 第3827节</h3>
<h4 align="center"></h4><p><strong>3827.</strong>“因为他深爱拉结，这七年在他眼里如同几天”表爱的状态，也就是说，一点也不乏味的状态。这从 “在他眼里”和“天”的含义清楚可知：“在他眼里”是指它如此显现；“天”是指状态（参看<a href="893.htm">893</a>，<a href="2788.htm">2788</a>，<a href="3462.htm">3462</a>，<a href="3785.htm">3785</a>节）。因此，“因为他深爱拉结，（这七年）如同几天”表爱的状态。当人进入爱的状态，或属天情感的状态时，他便进入天使的状态；也就是说，只要那情感没有改变的冲动，时间仿佛不存在。因为冲动是一种肉体情感；人越屈服于肉体情感，时间对他来说就越存在；而他越不屈服于它，时间就越不存在。这一点通过属于情感或爱的一切快乐和开心感觉可在某种程度上反映出来。人开心快乐的时候，往往意识不到时间，因为那时他活在内在人里面。他凭借真爱的情感而从肉体和世俗事物中退出，因为他的心智被提升向天堂，因而服务于时间的事物中退出。事实上，正是我们思虑那些不属于情感或爱、因而单调乏味的事物才产生了明显的时间感觉。由此可见，“因为他深爱拉结，这七年在他眼里如同几天”是什么意思。</p>

And they were in his eyes as a few days, for the love he had to her. That this signifies a state of love, namely, that it was free from tedium, is evident from the signification of "to be in his eyes," 
as being to so appear; and from the signification of "days," as being states (see n. 893, 2788, 3462, 3785). Hence, "as a few days for the love he had to her," denotes a state of love. When man is 
in a state of love, or of celestial affection, he is in an angelic state, that is to say, as if not in time, provided there is no impatience in the affection; for impatience is a corporeal affection, 
and insofar as man is in it, so far he is in time; but insofar as man is not in it, so far he is not in time. This appears in a kind of image from all the delights and gladnesses that belong to affection 
or love, in that when man is in them, he takes no note of time, for he is then in the internal man. By the affection of genuine love man is withdrawn from bodily and worldly things, for his mind is 
elevated toward heaven, and thus is withdrawn from the things of time. The reason why time appears to be something is that we reflect upon things that do not belong to the affection or love, thus which 
are tedious. From this we can see what is signified by the seven years being in his eyes as a few days for the love he had to her. </p>

'And they were in his eyes like a few days, because of his love for her' means a state of love, that is to say, a state without any tedium. This is clear from the meaning of 'being in his eyes' as its 
appearing to be so, from the meaning of 'days' as states, dealt with in <a href="893.htm">893</a>, <a href="2788.htm">2788</a>, <a href="3462.htm">3462</a>, <a href="3785.htm">3785</a>; therefore 'like a few days, because of his love for her' means a state of love. When anyone enters a state 
of love or heavenly affection he enters an angelic state; that is to say, it is as though time does not exist, provided that that affection holds no urge for change. That urge is a bodily affection; 
and insofar as anyone is subject to it time exists for him, but insofar as he is not subject to it time does not exist. This is reflected somewhat in the delights and glad feelings that go with affection 
or love. When someone experiences these he is not conscious of time, since he is living within the internal man during such experiences. By means of the affection that is an attribute of genuine 
love a person is drawn away from bodily and worldly interests, for his mind is lifted up towards heaven, and so he is drawn away from things that belong to time. Indeed it is reflecting on those things 
which are not the objects of one's affection or love, and so on things that are tedious, that gives rise to an apparent sense of time. From this one may also see what is meant by the seven years being 
in his eyes like a few days, because of his love for her. </p>

`Et fuerunt in oculis ejus sicut dies aliqui in amando illo eam:  quod significet statum amoris, quod nempe absque taedio, constat ex significatione `esse in oculis ejus' quod sit ita apparere; ex 
significatione `dierum' quod sint status, de qua n. 893, 2788, 3462, 3785; inde `sicut dies aliqui in amando illo eam' est status amoris; cum homo est in statu amoris seu affectionis caelestis, tunc 
est in statu angelico, nempe non quasi in tempore, si non affectioni illi inest impatientia, haec enim est affectio corporea, in qua quantum est homo, tantum est in tempore, sed quantum non simul 
in {1}illa, tantum non est in tempore; hoc patet in quadam imagine a jucundis et laetis quae sunt affectionis seu amoris, quod cum homo in his est, non appareat ei tempus, est enim in interno homine 
tunc; per affectionem genuini amoris abstrahitur homo a corporeis et mundanis, nam elevatur mens ejus {2}versus caelum, ita abstrahitur ab illis quae sunt temporis; tempus enim apparens quid {3}est 
ex reflexione super illa quae non affectionis seu amoris sunt, ita quae taedii {5}; inde etiam patet quid significat quod `septem anni fuerint in oculis ejus sicut dies aliqui in amando illo
