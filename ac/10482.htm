Verses 26-29. And Moses stood in the gate of the camp, and said, Who is for Jehovah? Come unto me. And all the sons of Levi were gathered together unto him. And he said to them, Thus saith Jehovah the 
God of Israel, Put ye every man his sword upon his thigh, and pass ye through and return from gate to gate in the camp, and slay ye, a man his brother, and a man his companion, and a man his neighbor. 
And the sons of Levi did according to the word of Moses; and there fell of the people that day up to three thousand men. And Moses said, Fill ye your hand this day to Jehovah, for a man is against 
his son, and against his brother; that He may bestow upon you a blessing this day. "And Moses stood in the gate of the camp," signifies where the opening to hell is; "and said, Who is for Jehovah? Come 
unto me" signifies those who are in external things from what is internal; "and all the sons of Levi were gathered together unto him," signifies those who are in truths from good; "and he said unto 
them," signifies exhortation; "Thus saith Jehovah the God of Israel," signifies by the Lord; "Put ye every man his sword upon his thigh," signifies truth from good fighting against falsity from evil; 
"and pass ye through and return from gate to gate in the camp," signifies wheresoever there is anything open from what is internal into what is external; "and slay ye, a man his brother, and a man his 
companion, and a man his neighbor," signifies a closing in respect to the influx of good and truth and of all that is related thereto, in order to prevent any reception and communication; "and the sons 
of Levi did according to the word of Moses," signifies this accomplished by those who are in truths from good; "and there fell of the people that day up to three thousand men," signifies a full and 
complete closing of what is internal; "and Moses said, Fill ye your hand this day to Jehovah," signifies that which is communicative and receptive of Divine truth in the heavens; "for a man is against 
his son, and against his brother," signifies when the internal has been closed in order to prevent truth and good from heaven from entering into what is external; "that He may bestow upon you a blessing 
this day," signifies the reception of Divine truth from the Word, and thereby conjunction with the Lord. </p>

Verses 26-29  And Moses stood in the gate of the camp, and said, Whoever is for Jehovah, [come] to me. And all the sons of Levi gathered themselves to him. And he said to them, Thus says Jehovah the 
God of Israel, Put everyone [his] sword on his thigh; go to and fro<A name="fntext1"></a><A href="#fn1"><sup>a</sup></a> from gate to gate in the camp, and kill [every] man his brother, and [every] man his companion, and [every] man his neighbour. And

his son and against his brother), so that He may bestow a blessing on you today. </p>
<p>'And Moses stood in the gate of the camp' means where the opening to hell is situated. 'And said, Whoever is for 
Jehovah, [come] to me' means those whose concern for external things springs from what is internal. 'And all the sons of Levi gathered themselves to him' means those in possession of truths springing 
from good. 'And he said to them' means exhortation. 'Thus says Jehovah the God of Israel' means from the Lord. ['Put everyone his sword on his thigh' means truth springing from good engaged in conflict 
against falsity arising from evil.] 'Go to and fro from gate to gate in the camp' means wherever anything lies open from what is internal into what is external. 'And kill [every] man his brother, and 
[every] man his companion, and [every] man his neighbour' means a shutting off to prevent any reception and transmission of inflowing goodness and truth, and of the things touching on them. 'And the 
sons of Levi did according to the word of Moses' means put into effect by those in possession of truths springing from good. 'And there fell of the people on that day up to three thousand men' means 
a complete shutting off of what is internal. 'And Moses said, Fill your hand today to Jehovah' means the transmission and the reception of Divine Truth in the heavens. 'For [every] man has been against 
his son and against his brother' means when the internal has been shut off to prevent the entrance into the external of truth and good from heaven. 'So that He may bestow a blessing on you today' means 
the reception of Divine Truth from the Word, and being joined thereby to the Lord.

Vers. 26-29.  Et stetit Moscheh in porta castrorum, et dixit, Quis Jehovae, ad me; et congregati sunt ad illum omnes filii Levi.  Et dixit illis, Ita dicit Jehovah Deus Israelis, Ponite quisque gladium 
[suum] super femur suum, transite et redite a porta ad portam in castris, et occidite vir fratrem suum, et vir socium suum, et vir propinquum suum.  Et fecerunt filii Levi secundum verbum Moschis; 
et cecidit ex populo in die illo ad tria milia virorum.  Et dixit Moscheh, Implete manum vestram hodie Jehovae, quia vir in filium suum, et in fratrem suum, et ad dandum super vos hodie benedictionem.

bono pugnans contra falsum ex malo:] `transite et redite a porta ad portam in castris' significat ubicumque aliquid apertum ab interno in externum: `et occidite vir fratrem suum, et vir socium suum, 
et vir Propinquum suum' significat occlusionem quoad influxum boni et veri, ac affinium illis, ne sit aliqua receptio et communicatio: `et fecerunt filii Levi secundum verbum Moschis' significat effectum 
ab illis qui in veris ex bono: `et cecidit in populo in die illo ad tria milia virorum' significat occlusionem interni plenariam; `et dixit Moscheh, Implete manum vestram hodie Jehovae' significat 
communicativum et receptivum Divini Veri in caelis: `quia vir in filium Suum, et in fratrem Suum' significat quando occlusum est internum, ne verum et bonum e caelo intrent in externum: `ad dandum super 
vos hodie benedictionem' significat receptionem Divini Veri ex Verbo, et per id conjunctionem cum Domino. @1 See p. ix preliminary note 2. 	26. Et stetit Moscheh in porta castrorum, significat 
prope ad externum quod religiosi illius: et dixit, quis Jehovae ad me, significat qui non separat Divinum internum ab externo: et congregati sunt ad illum omnes filii Levi, significat qui in veris ex

falsum mali: transite et redite a porta ad portam in castris, significat apud totam illam gentem quae in solis externis ex jucundo amoris sui et mundi: et occidite vir fratrem suum, et vir socium
