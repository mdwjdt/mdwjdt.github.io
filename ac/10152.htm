<h3 align="center" class="ired">属天的奥秘 第10152节</h3>
<h4 align="center"></h4><p><strong>10152</strong>.“也要使亚伦和他的儿子分别为圣，给我供祭司的职分”表就拯救的工作而言，在这两层天堂中的主的一个代表。这从“亚伦”、“亚伦的儿子”和“祭司的职分”的代表清楚可知：“亚伦”是指属天良善方面的主（参看<a href="9806.htm">9806</a>，<a href="9946.htm">9946</a>，<a href="10068.htm">10068</a>节）；“亚伦的儿子”是指属灵良善方面的主（<a href="10017.htm">10017</a>，<a href="10068.htm">10068</a>节），因而是在两层天堂里面，就是高层天堂和低层天堂里面（因为无论你说属天良善，还是说属天国度，或高层天堂，都是一回事；无论你说属灵良善，还是说属灵国度，或低层天堂，也都是一回事；关于高层天堂和低层天堂，可参看刚才的说明<a href="10150.htm">10150</a>，<a href="10151.htm">10151</a>节）；“祭司的职分”是指主的拯救工作（<a href="9809.htm">9809</a>，<a href="10017.htm">10017</a>节）。由此明显可知“使亚伦和他的儿子分别为圣，给耶和华供祭司的职分”表示就拯救的工作而言，在这两层天堂中的主的一个代表。<br />在此可以就主的拯救工作多说几句。在教会，众所周知，主是人类的救主和救赎主，但很少有人知道当如何理解这句话。那些处于教会外在的人以为主用自己的宝血救赎了这个世界，也就是人类，他们将主的宝血理解为祂在十字架上的受难。但那些处于教会内在的人却知道，没有人是靠主的宝血得救的，只有靠照主的圣言所教导的信与仁的诫命的生活。那些处于教会至内在的人则将主的宝血理解为从祂发出的神性真理，将十字架受难理解为主所经历的最后试探，祂通过这最后的试探完全征服地狱，同时荣耀祂的人身，也就是使它变成神性，由此救赎和拯救所有允许自己通过照祂的圣言所教导的信与仁的诫命生活而重生的人。此外，天上的天使照内义来理解圣言，而“主的宝血”在内义上用来表示从主发出的神性真理（<a href="4735.htm">4735</a>，<a href="5476.htm">5476</a>，<a href="6978.htm">6978</a>，<a href="7317.htm">7317</a>，<a href="7326.htm">7326</a>，<a href="7850.htm">7850</a>，<a href="9127.htm">9127</a>，<a href="9393.htm">9393</a>，<a href="10026.htm">10026</a>，<a href="10033.htm">10033</a>节）。<br />但没有人知道人类如何被神性通过征服地狱和荣耀祂的人身而被拯救 和救赎，除非他知道每个人都来自天堂的天使和来自地狱的灵人与他同在，并且除非这些天使和灵人不断与人同在，否则此人无法思考或意愿任何事；因此，就其内层而言，人要么在来自地狱的灵人的统治之下，要么在来自天堂的天使的统治之下。一旦知道这一切，就能明白，若非主完全征服地狱，将地狱和天堂里的一切事物都恢复秩序，没有人能得救。若非主将祂的人身变成神性，并通过如此行而为自己获得永远掌管地狱和天堂的神性能力，同样没有人能得救；因为没有神性能力，地狱和天堂都不能保持在秩序中。能使任何事物存在的能力必是永恒的，以便这个事物能持续存在，因为持续存在就是永恒存在。<br />被称为“父”的神性本身若没有被称为“子”的神性人身，就无法完成拯救的工作，因为没有神性人身的神性本身无法抵达一个人那里，甚至无法抵达一位天使那里，因为人类已经完全远离了神性。当最终不再有任何信，也不再有任何仁时，这种情况就会属生。因此，那时主就降世恢复一切事物，如此行凭的是祂的人身，由此通过人们从主所获得的对主的信和爱而拯救和救赎他们。事实上，主能阻止这些人下地狱，免受永恒的诅咒，但无法阻止那些弃绝从祂获得并回献给祂的信和爱之人，因为这些人弃绝救恩和救赎。<br />神性本身通过神性人身实现这一切，这一点从圣言中的大量经文清楚看出来，如在神性人身，也就是神的儿子被称为耶和华的右手和膀臂的经文中；在经上说主拥有天上地上一切权柄的经文中。主被称为“耶和华的右手和膀臂”（参看<a href="10019.htm">10019</a>节）；祂拥有天上地上一切的权柄（参看<a href="10089.htm">10089</a>节）。主凭神性人身征服地狱，将地狱和天堂里的一切事物都恢复秩序，同时荣耀了祂的人身，也就是将它变成神性（参看<a href="9528.htm">9528</a>，<a href="9715.htm">9715</a>，<a href="9809.htm">9809</a>，<a href="9937.htm">9937</a>，<a href="10019.htm">10019</a>节提到的地方）；被称为“父”的神性本身通过神性人身实现这一切，这一点明显可见于约翰福音：<br />太初有圣言，圣言与神同在，神就是圣言；万物都是藉着祂造的，凡被造的，没有一样不是藉着祂造的。圣言成了肉身，住在我们中间。（约翰福音<a href="http://39-27.cn/约1.1.htm">1:1</a>-<a href="http://39-27.cn/约1.3.htm">3</a>，<a href="http://39-27.cn/约1.14.htm">14</a>）<br />此处很明显，神性人身方面的主就是那在此被称为“圣言”的，因为经上说“圣言成了肉身”。<br />从来没有人看见神，只有在父怀里的独生子将祂表明出来。（约翰福音<a href="http://39-27.cn/约1.18.htm">1:18</a>）<br /><br />你们从来没有听见父的响声，也没有看见祂的形状。（约翰福音<a href="http://39-27.cn/约5.37.htm">5:37</a>）<br /><br />我就是道路、真理、生命；若不藉着我，没有人能到父那里去。从今以后，你们认识祂，并且已经看见祂。人看见了我，就是看见了父。（约翰福音<a href="http://39-27.cn/约14.6.htm">14:6</a>-<a href="http://39-27.cn/约14.7.htm">7</a>，<a href="http://39-27.cn/约14.9.htm">9</a>）<br />马太福音：<br />除了子和子所愿意指示的，没有人知道父。（马太福音<a href="http://39-27.cn/太11.27.htm">11:27</a>）<br />由此可见何为拯救和救赎的工作，这工作是通过祂的神性人身实现的。</p>

And Aaron and his sons will I sanctify, to minister to Me in the priest's office. That this signifies a representative of the Lord in both heavens in respect to the work of salvation, is evident from 
the representation of Aaron, as being the Lord as to celestial good (see n. 9806, 9946, 10068); and from the representation of the sons of Aaron, as being the Lord as to spiritual good (n. 10017, 10068); 
thus in both heavens, as well the higher as the lower, for whether you say celestial good, or the celestial kingdom, or the higher heavens, it is the same. (Concerning the higher and the lower heavens, 
see what was said just above, n. 10150, 10151.) And from the representation of the priest's office, as being the Lord's work of salvation (n. 9809, 10017). From this it is evident that by "sanctifying 
Aaron and his sons to minister to Jehovah in the priest's office" is signified a representative of the Lord in both heavens in respect to the work of salvation. [2] Something may here be said 
about the Lord's work of salvation. It is known in the church that the Lord is the Savior and the Redeemer of the human race, but it is known to few how this is to be understood. They who are in the 
externals of the church believe                          that the Lord redeemed the world, that is, the human race, by His own blood, by which they mean the passion of the cross; but they who are in the 
internals of the church know that no one is saved by the Lord's blood, but by a life according to the precepts of faith and charity from the Lord's Word. They who are in the inmosts of the church understand 
by the Lord's blood the Divine truth proceeding from Him, and by the passion of the cross they understand the last of the Lord's temptation, by which He completely subjugated the hells and at 
the same time glorified His Human, that is, made it Divine; and that thereby He redeemed and saved all who suffer themselves to be regenerated by a life according to the precepts of faith and of charity 
from His Word. Moreover, by "the Lord's blood" in the internal sense, according to which the angels in the heavens perceive the Word, is meant the Divine truth proceeding from the Lord (n. 4735, 
5476, 6978, 7317, 7326, 7850, 9127, 9393, 10026, 10033). [3] But no one can know how man was saved and redeemed by the Divine through the subjection of the hells and the glorification of His Human, unless 
he knows that there are with every man angels from heaven and spirits from hell, and that unless these are constantly present with man, he cannot think anything, or will anything; and thus that 
in respect to his interiors man is either under the dominion of spirits who are from hell, or else is under the dominion of angels who are from heaven. When this is first known, it can then be known that 
unless the Lord had wholly subjugated the hells, and reduced all things both there and in the heavens into order, no one could have been saved; nor likewise unless the Lord had made His Human Divine, 
and had thereby acquired for Himself to eternity Divine power over the hells and over the heavens. For neither the hells nor the heavens can be kept in order without Divine power, because the power 
by which anything comes forth must be perpetual for it to subsist, for subsistence is a perpetual coming forth. [4] The Divine Itself which is called "the Father," without the Divine Human which is 
called "the Son," could not effect this, because the Divine Itself without the Divine Human cannot reach man, nor even an angel, when the human race has altogether removed itself from the Divine. This 
came to pass in the end of the times, when there was no longer any faith or any charity; and therefore the Lord then came into the world and restored all things, and this by virtue of His Human; and 
thus saved and redeemed man through faith and love to the Lord from the Lord; for such the Lord can withhold from the hells and from eternal damnation, but not those who reject faith and love from Him 
to Him, for these reject salvation and redemption. [5] That the Divine Itself does this by means of the Divine Human is evident from many passages in the Word, as from those in which the Divine Human, 
which is the Son of God, is called the right hand and arm of Jehovah; and in which it is said that the Lord has all power in the heavens and on earth. (That the Lord is called the "right hand and 
arm of Jehovah," see n. 10019; and that He has all power in the heavens and on earth, n. 10089.) That by virtue of the Divine Human the Lord subjugated the hells, and reduced all things therein and in 
the heavens into order, and at the same time glorified His Human, that is, made it Divine, see the places cited in n. 9528, 9715, 9809, 9937, 10019; and that the Divine Itself, which is called "the Father," 
effected this by means of the Divine Human is evident in John: </p>
<p>     In the beginning was the Word, and the Word was with God, and God was the Word; all things were made by Him, and without Him 
was not anything made that was made; and the Word was made flesh, and dwelt among us (John 1:1-3, 14); </p>
<p>it is evident that the Lord as to the Divine Human is He who is here called "the Word," for it 
is said, "the Word was made flesh." And again: </p>
<p>     No one hath seen God at any time, the Only-begotten Son, who is in the bosom of the Father, He hath set Him forth (John 1:18).      Ye have neither 
heard the voice of the Father at any time, nor seen His shape (John 5:37).      I am the way, the truth, and the life; no one cometh unto the Father, but by Me. Henceforth ye have known the Father, 
and have seen Him. He that seeth Me seeth the Father (John 14:6-7, 9).      No one knoweth the Father save the Son, and he to whom the Son shall will to reveal Him (Matt. 11:27). From all this it 
can now be seen what the work of salvation and of redemption is, and that it is effected by virtue of the Lord's Divine Human. </p>

'And Aaron and his sons [I will sanctify], to serve Me in the priestly office' means that which is representative of the Lord in both groups of heavens in respect of the work of salvation. This is clear 
from the representation of 'Aaron' as the Lord in respect of celestial good, dealt with in <a href="9806.htm">9806</a>, <a href="9946.htm">9946</a>, <a href="10068.htm">10068</a>, and from the representation of 'Aaron's sons' as the Lord in respect of spiritual good, 
dealt with in <a href="10017.htm">10017</a>, <a href="10068.htm">10068</a>, thus in both groups of heavens, the higher heavens and the lower ones (for whether you say celestial good, or the celestial kingdom, or the higher heavens, it amounts to 
the same thing; and also whether you say spiritual good, or the spiritual kingdom, or the lower heavens, it amounts to the same thing; regarding the higher and the lower heavens, see what has been stated 
immediately above in <a href="10150.htm">10150</a>, <a href="10151.htm">10151</a>); and from the representation of 'the priestly office' as the Lord's work of salvation, dealt with in <a href="9809.htm">9809</a>, <a href="10017.htm">10017</a>. From these representations it is evident that 'sanctifying 
Aaron and his sons to serve Jehovah in the priestly office' means that which is representative of the Lord in both groups of heavens in respect of the work of salvation.  </p>
<p></p>
<p><b>[2]</b>
 Something 
more about the Lord's work of salvation can be mentioned here. It is well known in the Church that the Lord is the Saviour and Redeemer of the human race, though few know how to understand this. Those 
acquainted with the outward things of the Church believe that the Lord redeemed the world, that is, the human race, by His blood, by which they understand His passion on the Cross. But those acquainted 
with the inward realities of the Church know that no one is saved by the Lord's blood, only by a life in keeping with the commandments of faith and charity taught by the Lord's Word. Those acquainted 
with the inmost realities of the Church understand by the Lord's blood Divine Truth emanating from Him. By His passion on the Cross they understand the final temptation the Lord underwent, by which 
He completely subdued the hells and at the same time glorified His Human, that is, made it Divine, thereby also redeeming and saving all who allow themselves to be regenerated through a life in keeping 
with the commandments of faith and charity taught by His Word. 'The Lord's blood' furthermore is used in the internal sense, according to which the angels in heaven perceive the Word, to mean Divine 
Truth emanating from the Lord, see, <a href="4735.htm">4735</a>, <a href="5476.htm">5476</a>, <a href="6978.htm">6978</a>, <a href="7317.htm">7317</a>, <a href="7326.htm">7326</a>, <a href="7850.htm">7850</a>, <a href="9127.htm">9127</a>, <a href="9393.htm">9393</a>, <a href="10026.htm">10026</a>, <a href="10033.htm">10033</a>.  </p>
<p></p>
<p><b>[3]</b>
 But in what way mankind was saved and redeemed by the Divine through His subduing of the hells 
and glorifying of His Human none can know if they do not know that each individual person has angels from heaven and spirits from hell present with him, and that unless these were present with a person 
unceasingly, the person could not think anything or will anything, so that the person is inwardly subject to the influence either of spirits who come from hell or of angels from heaven. Once all 
this is known it may be seen that unless the Lord had completely subdued the hells and had restored all things to order both there and in the heavens, no one could have been saved. Nor could any have 
been saved unless the Lord had made Divine His Human, and by doing this had acquired to Himself Divine power over the hells and over the heavens for evermore; for without Divine power neither the hells 
nor the heavens can be kept in order. The power which enables anything to come into being must be everlasting, if that thing is to remain in being; for remaining in being is an everlasting coming into 
being. </p>
<p><b>[4]</b>
 The Divine Himself, called the Father, could not have accomplished the work of salvation without the Divine Human, referred to as the Son, for the Divine Himself without the Divine Human 
cannot reach a person, not even an angel, because the human race has moved away completely from the Divine. This happened when eventually there was no longer any faith nor any charity. At that time therefore 
the Lord came into the world and restored all things, doing so from His Humanity; and by doing that He saved and redeemed people through their faith and love to the Lord, received from the Lord. 
For the Lord can withhold these people from hell and eternal damnation, but not those who reject faith and love received from and offered back to Him, since they reject salvation and redemption.  </p>
<p></p>
<p><b>[5]</b>
The truth that the Divine Himself achieves this through the Divine Human is clear from a large number of places in the Word, such as those in which the Divine Human, that is, the Son of God, is 
called the right hand and the arm of Jehovah, or in which it says that the Lord has all power in heaven and on earth. The fact that the Lord is called the right hand and the arm of Jehovah, see <a href="10019.htm">10019</a>; 
that He has all power in heaven and on earth, <a href="10089.htm">10089</a>; and that from His Divine Human the Lord subdued the hells, restored all things to order there and in the heavens, and at the same time glorified 
His Human, that is, made it Divine, see the places referred to in <a href="9528.htm">9528</a>, and what has been stated in <a href="9715.htm">9715</a>, <a href="9809.htm">9809</a>, <a href="9937.htm">9937</a>, <a href="10019.htm">10019</a>. And the truth that the Divine Himself, called the Father, accomplished this 
through the Divine Human is evident in John,  </p>
<blockquote>
In the beginning was the Word, and the Word was with God, and the Word was God. All things were made through Him, and without Him nothing was made<A name="fntext1"></a><A href="#fn1"><sup>a</sup></a> that 
was made<A name="fntext1"></a><A href="#fn1"><sup>a</sup></a>. And the Word became flesh and dwelt among us. <a href="http://bible.gospelcom.net/cgi-bin/bible?passage=John%201:1-3,14&amp;version=ESV&amp;interface=print&amp;showfn=yes&amp;showxref">John 1:1-3,14</a>.  
</blockquote>
<p>Here it is evident that the Lord as to His Divine Human is the One who is called 'the Word', for it says that 'the Word became 
flesh'. And in addition to this,  </p>
<blockquote>
Nobody has ever seen God; the only begotten Son who is in the bosom of the Father, He has made Him known. <a href="http://bible.gospelcom.net/cgi-bin/bible?passage=John%201:18&amp;version=ESV&amp;interface=print&amp;showfn=yes&amp;showxref">John 1:18</a>.  
</blockquote>
<p>And elsewhere in the same gospel,  </p>
<blockquote>
You 
have never heard the Father's voice nor seen His shape. <a href="http://bible.gospelcom.net/cgi-bin/bible?passage=John%205:37&amp;version=ESV&amp;interface=print&amp;showfn=yes&amp;showxref">John 5:37</a>.  
</blockquote>
<p>And in the same gospel,  </p>
<blockquote>
I am the way, the truth, and the life. No one comes to the Father except through Me. From now on 
you know the Father and have seen Him. He who sees Me sees the Father. <a href="http://bible.gospelcom.net/cgi-bin/bible?passage=John%2014:6,7,9&amp;version=ESV&amp;interface=print&amp;showfn=yes&amp;showxref">John 14:6,7,9</a>.  
</blockquote>
<p>And in Matthew,  </p>
<blockquote>
No one knows the Father except the Son, and he to whom the Son wishes to reveal Him. <a href="http://bible.gospelcom.net/cgi-bin/bible?passage=Matt%2011:27&amp;version=ESV&amp;interface=print&amp;showfn=yes&amp;showxref">Matt 11:27</a>.  
</blockquote>
<p>From all this it may now be seen what the work of salvation and redemption is, and that this is accomplished through His Divine Human.

Humanum id effecerit, patet apud Johannem,      	In principio erat Verbum, et Verbum erat apud Deum, et Deus erat Verbum; omnia per Ipsum facta sunt, et sine Ipso factum est nihil quod factum est; et 
Verbum caro factum est et habitavit inter nos, i 1-3, 14; </p>
<p>quod ibi Dominus quoad Divinum Humanum sit qui vocatur `Verbum,' patet, nam dicitur `Verbum caro factum est': et porro,      	Deum nemo vidit 
unquam; unigenitus Filius, Qui in sinu Patris est, Ille exposuit, vers. (x)18: </p>
<p>et alibi apud eundem,      	Non vocem Patris audivistis unquam, neque speciem Ipsius vidistis, v 37: </p>
<p>et apud eundem,  
    	Ego sum via, veritas, et vita; nemo venit ad Patrem nisi per Me; abhinc cognovistis Patrem et vidistis Ipsum; qui videt Me videt Patrem, xiv 6, 7, 9: </p>
<p>et apud Matthaeum,      	Nemo cognoscit 
Patrem nisi Filius, et cui voluerit Filius revelare, xi 27. Ex his nunc constare potest quid opus salvationis (o)et redemptionis, et quod id sit ex Divino Humano Ipsius. @1 de illis$ @2 i hic$ @3
