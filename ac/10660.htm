<h3 align="center" class="ired">属天的奥秘 第10660节</h3>
<h4 align="center"></h4><p><strong>10660</strong>.“凡开了子宫的都是我的”表纯真、仁爱和信仰的一切良善都要归于主。这从“开了子宫的”的含义清楚可知。“开了子宫的”是指从主出生的；因为一个人以属世的方式从父母成孕并出生，但却以属灵的方式从主出生。从主出生就是“开了子宫”在内义上所表示的。若非如此，头生的牲畜归耶和华，也就是归主这条律法有什么意义呢？此外，正在重生的人成孕、出生，并重新被培养，以这种方式被引离他从父母所获得的属世状态的邪恶。此处所论述的主题是头生的牲畜；但“牲畜”表示与人同住的良善和真理，因为各种牲畜都对应于诸如存在于人里面的那类情感，这从9280节提到的地方可以看出来。由此可见，“凡开了子宫的都是耶和华的”表示被主赋予那些重新出生，也就是正在重生之人的纯真、仁爱和信仰的良善。说这些要归于主，就是要承认它们来自主；因为除非人们承认并相信它们来自主，否则它们就不是良善。一切良善皆来自主，非来自祂的东西来自人；凡来自人的都是邪恶，哪怕它外表看似良善。因为人的自我，或人自己的东西无非是邪恶，良善不可能出自邪恶。</p>

Everything that openeth the womb is Mine. That this signifies that all the good of innocence, of charity, and of faith is to be ascribed to the Lord, is evident from the signification of "that which 
openeth the womb," as being that which is born of the Lord; for a man is conceived and born naturally from his parents; but spiritually from the Lord. This latter birth is what is meant in the internal 
sense by "that which openeth the womb." Otherwise what could be meant by the firstborn of cattle being Jehovah's, that is, the Lord's? Moreover, the man who is being regenerated is conceived, born, 
and brought up anew, and in this way is withdrawn from the evils of the natural state which he had from his parents. The subject here treated of is the firstborn of cattle, but by "cattle" are meant the 
goods and truths with man, for cattle of every kind correspond to affections such as belong to man (as can be seen from the places cited in n. 9280). From all this it can be seen that by "that which 
openeth the womb being Jehovah's," is signified the good of innocence, of charity, and of faith, which those have from the Lord who are born anew, that is, who are being regenerated. It is said that 
these are to be ascribed to the Lord, that is, that it is to be acknowledged that they are from Him; for unless they are acknowledged and believed to be from the Lord they are not goods, because all 
good is from Him, and that which is not from Him is from man, and whatever is from man is evil, although in the external form it may appear good; because what is man's own is nothing but evil, and good 
cannot be brought forth from evil. </p>

'All that opens the womb is Mine' means that all the good of innocence, charity, and faith is to be ascribed to the Lord. This is clear from the meaning of 'that which opens the womb' as that which is 
born from the Lord; for a person is conceived and born from parents in a natural manner, but from the Lord in a spiritual one. This birth from Him is what should be understood in the internal sense 
by 'that which opens the womb'. If such were not meant what would be the point of the law that the firstborn of cattle were to be Jehovah's, that is, the Lord's? Furthermore the person who is being regenerated 
is conceived, born, and brought up anew, and in this manner is led away from the evils of the natural condition which he acquired from his parents. The subject here is the firstborn of cattle; 
but by cattle the forms of good and the truths that reside with a person should be understood. For cattle of every kind correspond to affections such as exist in the human being, as becomes clear from 
the places referred to in <a href="9280.htm">9280</a>. From these it becomes clear that 'that which opens the womb, which is Jehovah's' means the good of innocence, charity, and faith, which are imparted by the Lord to 
those who are born anew, that is, who are being regenerated. It is said that these are to be ascribed to the Lord, that is, it should be acknowledged that they come from Him; for unless people acknowledge 
and believe that they come from the Lord they are not forms of good. All good comes from Him, and what does not come from Him comes from man; and whatever comes from man, though it seems to outward 
appearance to be good, is nevertheless bad. For the human proprium is nothing but evil, and from what is bad no good can be brought forth.  </p>

`Omnis apertura uteri Mihi':  quod significet quod omne bonum innocentiae, charitatis, et fidei addicandum sit Domino, constat ex significatione `aperturae uteri' quod sit quod nascitur a Domino, homo 
enim a parentibus concipitur et nascitur naturaliter, a Domino autem spiritualiter; haec {1}nativitas est quae in (t)sensu interno per `aperturam uteri' intelligitur; quid alioquin foret quod primogenitum 
{2}pecoris esset Jehovae, hoc est, Domino?  homo etiam qui regeneratur, e novo concipitur, nascitur, et educatur, et sic abducitur {3}a malis status naturalis qui fuit ipsi a parentibus; agitur 
hic de {4}primogenito pecoris, sed per pecora intelliguntur bona et vera apud hominem, nam pecora omnis generis correspondent affectionibus quales sunt homini, ut constare potest ex locis citatis n. 
9280; ex quibus constare potest quod per `aperturam uteri quae Jehovae' significetur bonum innocentiae, charitatis, et fidei, quae a Domino illis qui e novo nascuntur, hoc est, qui regenerantur.  Dicitur 
quod illa addicanda sint Domino, hoc est, agnoscendum quod ab Ipso, nam nisi agnoscantur et credantur quod a Domino, non sunt bona, omne enim bonum est ab Ipso, et quod non ab Ipso, est ab homine, 
et {5}quicquid ab homine, utcumque in externa forma appareat {6} bonum, usque est malum, nam proprium hominis non est nisi quam malum, et a malo non produci potest bonum. @1 nascentia$ @2 bestiae
