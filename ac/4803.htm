<h3 align="center" class="ired">属天的奥秘 第4803节</h3>
<h4 align="center"></h4><p><strong>4803.</strong>有一件事完全不为世人所知，却值得一提，即：善灵和天使的状态不断变化和完善。他们以这种方式被提升到他们所住区域的内层，从而进入更高尚的功能。因为在天堂，洁净持续进行，这可以是一个新的创造。然而，情况是这样：天使永远不可能达到绝对的完美。唯独主是完美的；一切完善皆在祂里面并来自祂。那些对应于嘴的人总渴望说话，因为说话赋予他们莫大的乐趣。他们在经历完美的时候，只能说有益于同伴、社群、天堂和主的话。他们以这种方式说话的快乐照着在他们所说的话中关注自己，并出于自己的东西寻求智慧的欲望消失的程度而增长。</p>

It is worthy of mention, being wholly unknown in the world, that the states of good spirits and of angels are continually changing and perfecting, and that they are thus raised into the interiors of 
the province in which they are, and so into nobler functions; for in heaven there is a continual purification, and so to speak new creation; but still the case is such that no angel can possibly attain 
absolute perfection even to eternity. The Lord alone is perfect; in Him and from Him is all perfection. They who correspond to the mouth are continually desiring to speak, for in speaking they find 
their greatest pleasure. When they are being perfected they are reduced to this - that they do not speak anything but what is of service to their companions, to the common good, to heaven, and to the 
Lord. The delight of so speaking is enhanced with them in the degree of the loss of the desire to regard themselves in their speech, and to seek wisdom from their own. </p>

A matter wholly unknown in the world and worthy of mention is this: The states in which good spirits and angels live undergo constant change and perfection In this way they are conveyed to the more internal 
parts of the province in which they dwell, and so into more excellent functions. For in heaven purification takes place constantly, which is so to speak a new creation. Yet the situation is that 
no angel to all eternity can possibly attain complete perfection. The Lord alone is the perfect One, He being the root and the source of all perfection. Those who correspond to the mouth constantly 
wish to be speaking, for speaking gives them utmost pleasure. While undergoing perfection they are restricted to speaking nothing but that which is beneficial to companions, the community, heaven, and 
the Lord. The delight they take in speaking in that way grows in the measure that the desire to regard themselves in what they speak and to strive after wisdom from what is properly their own passes 
away from them. </p>

Memoratu dignum est quod prorsus ignotum {1} in mundo, nempe quod spirituum bonorum et angelorum status continue mutentur et perficiantur et quod sic evehantur in interiora provinciae in qua sunt, 
ita in nobiliores functiones; est enim in caelo continua purificatio, ac ut ita dicatur, nova creatio; sed usque ita se res habet quod nusquam aliquis angelus ad absolutam {2} perfectionem pervenire 
possit in aeternum, Dominus solus est perfectus, in Ipso et ex Ipso est omnis perfectio.  Qui correspondent ori, continue volunt loqui, nam in loquendo summum voluptatis captant {3}; cum illi perficiuntur, 
rediguntur ad id ut non aliud loquantur quam quod conducit sociis, communi, caelo, Domino; augetur apud illos jucundum ita loquendi in tantum, in quantum perit cupido se spectandi in loquela, 
et ambiendi sapientiam ex proprio.      @1 i est$      @2 A ip absolutam above line.$      @3 habent$ </p>
