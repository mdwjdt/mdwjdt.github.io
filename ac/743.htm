<p><strong>[NCE]743.</strong> <a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_743/bible_king-james-version_genesis_7_8-9" target=_top>Genesis 7:8-9</a>. Of the clean animal and of the animal that is not clean and of the bird and of everything that creeps on the ground, two each, two each entered to Noah in the ark, a male and a female, as God had commanded Noah.<br />As earlier, a clean animal symbolizes positive emotions, an animal that is not clean symbolizes cravings, a bird in general symbolizes thoughts, and everything that creeps on the ground symbolizes the sensory level and anything that gives sensual pleasure. Two each, two each, symbolizes elements that answer to each other. They entered the ark means that they were protected. A male and a female symbolizes truth and goodness, as they have done before. As God had commanded Noah means it happened in this way. </p>
<p align="center"><b>Potts(1905-1910) 743</b></p><p><b>743.</b>
Verses 8, 9. Of the clean beast, and of the beast that is not clean, and of the fowl, and of everything that creepeth upon the ground, there went in two and two, to Noah into the ark, male and female, 
as God had commanded Noah. By "the clean beast" affections of good are signified as before; by "the beast that is not clean" cupidities; by "the fowl" in general, thoughts; by "everything that creepeth 
upon the ground" the sensuous part and its every pleasure; "two and two" signify things corresponding; that they "went into the ark" signifies that they were protected; "male and female" signify as 
before truth and good; "as God commanded Noah" signifies that so it came to pass. </p>

<p align="center"><b>Elliott(1983-1999) 743</b></p><p><b>743.</b>
Verses 8, 9 Of the clean beast, and of the beast that is not clean, and of the bird, and of everything that creeps over the ground. Two and two they went to Noah into the ark, male and female, as God 
had commanded Noah. </p>
<p>'The clean beast' means, as previously, affections for good. 'The beast that is not clean' means evil desires. 'Bird' in general means thoughts. 'Everything that creeps over the 
ground' means the sensory part and every associated delight. 'Two and two' means complementary things. 'They went into the ark' means that they were protected. 'Male and female', as previously, means 
truth and good. 'As God had commanded Noah' means that it was so accomplished. </p>

</p><b>743.</b>
Vers. 8, 9.  De bestia munda, et de bestia quae non ea munda, et de avi, et omni quod repit super humo. Bina bina intrarunt ad Noahum in arcam, masculus et femina, quemadmodum praeceperat Deus Noaho. 
 Per 'bestiam mundam' significantur, ut prius, affectiones boni: per 'bestiam non mundam' cupiditates: per 'avem' in genere cogitata per 'omne quod repit super humo' sensuale et quodcumque volupe 'bina 
bina' significant correspondentia: 'quod intrarint in arcam, quod tutata: 'masculus et femina,' ut prius, verum et bonum: 'quemadmodum praeceperat Deus Noaho' quod ita factum. </p>
