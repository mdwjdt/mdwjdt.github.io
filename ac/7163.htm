<h3 align="center" class="ired">属天的奥秘 第7163节</h3>
<h4 align="center"></h4><p><strong>7163.</strong>出埃及记5:22，23.摩西回到耶和华那里说，主啊，你为什么恶待这百姓呢？为什么差遣我呢？自从我到法老那里，奉你的名来说话，他就恶待这百姓，你一点也没有拯救你的百姓。<br />“摩西回到耶和华那里说”表来自神之律法的报怨。“主啊，你为什么恶待这百姓呢”表那些处于真理和良善的人受到虚假过分的侵扰。“为什么差遣我呢”表然而，当从神发出的律法似乎不是这么应许的时。“自从我到法老那里，奉你的名来说话”表当基于神的律法之物的命令出现在那些陷入虚假的人面前时。“他就恶待这百姓”表那时，那些处于教会的真理和良善之人似乎受到所引入的虚假的伤害。“你一点也没有拯救你的百姓”表他们没有从被虚假侵扰的状态中得以释放。</p>

Verses 22, 23. And Moses returned unto Jehovah, and said, Lord, wherefore hast Thou done evilly to this people? Why is this that Thou hast sent me? For since I came unto Pharaoh to speak in Thy name, 
he hath done evilly to this people; and liberating Thou hast not liberated Thy people. "And Moses returned unto Jehovah, and said," signifies complaint from the law Divine; "Lord, wherefore hast Thou 
done evilly to this people?" signifies that they who are in truths and goods are too much infested by falsities; "why is this that Thou hast sent me?" signifies when yet the law proceeding from the Divine 
seems to say otherwise; "for since I came unto Pharaoh to speak in Thy name, "thy name" signifies when the command from the things of the law Divine appeared to those who are in falsities; "he hath 
done evilly to this people," signifies that then through the injected falsities those who are in the truths and goods of the church seemed to be injured; "and liberating Thou hast not liberated Thy 
people," signifies that they were not released from a state of infestations by falsities. </p>

Verses 22,23 And Moses returned to Jehovah and said, Lord, why have You done ill to this people? Why is this, that You have sent me? And since I came to Pharaoh to speak in Your name, he has done ill 
to this people; and You have not delivered Your people at all.  </p>
<p>'And Moses returned to Jehovah and said' means complaint from the law of God. 'Lord, why have You done ill to this people?' means that 
those governed by truths and forms of good are molested excessively by falsities. 'Why is this, that You have sent me?' means when yet the law going forth from God seems to promise something different. 
'And since I came to Pharaoh to speak in Your name' means when the command based on matters contained in the law of God presented itself to those steeped in falsities. 'He has done ill to this people' 
means that at that time those governed by the Church's truths and forms of good seemingly suffered harm from the falsities that had been introduced. 'And You have not delivered Your people at all' 
means that they have not been released from the state of molestations by falsities.  </p>

Vers. 22, 23.  Et reversus Moscheh ad Jehovam, et dixit, Domine, quare malefecisti populo huic? quare hoc, misisti me?  Et ex quo veni ad Pharaonem ad loquendum in nomine Tuo, malefecit populo isti, 
et liberando non liberasti populum Tuum.  `Et reversus Moscheh ad Jehovam, et dixit' significat querimoniam ex lege Divina: `Domine, quare malefecisti populo huic?' significat quod illi qui in veris 
et bonis nimium infestentur a falsis: `quare hoc, misisti me?' significat cum tamen lex (c)a Divino (x)procedens videatur aliter dicere: `et ex quo veni ad Pharaonem ad loquendum in nomine Tuo' significat 
cum mandatum ex illis quae legis Divinae sunt appareret illis qui in falsis: `malefecit populo huic' significat quod tunc per injecta falsa viderentur laedi illi qui in Ecclesiae veris et bonis: 
`et liberando non liberasti populum Tuum' (x)significat quod e statu infestationum a falsis non exempti. </p>
