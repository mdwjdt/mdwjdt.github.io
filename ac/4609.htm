<h3 align="center" class="ired">属天的奥秘 第4609节</h3>
<h4 align="center"></h4><p><strong>4609.</strong>“利亚的使女悉帕的儿子：迦得，亚设”表服务于外层良善与真理的良善与真理。这从“利亚的使女悉帕”的代表清楚可知，“利亚的使女悉帕”是指辅助的情感，这种情感作为一种手段服务于对外层真理的情感（参看<a href="3835.htm">3835</a>节）。“使女”表示服务产生联结的一种手段，如刚才所述（<a href="4608.htm">4608</a>节）。她的“儿子”表示这种手段，其本质特征由“迦得和亚设”来代表；“迦得”在至高意义上表示全能和全知，在内在意义上表示信之良善，在外在意义上表示行为（<a href="3934.htm">3934</a>节）；而“亚设”在至高意义上表示永恒，在内在意义上表示永生的幸福，在外在意义上表示情感的快乐（<a href="3938.htm">3938</a>，<a href="3939.htm">3939</a>节）。这些就是对雅各儿子的这次列举所包含的事物。至于它们如何连贯在一起，一个跟随另一个，一个包含在另一个里面，这在尘世之光中是无法看到的，除非这光被天堂之光照亮。然而，即便能被看到的事物仍具有这样的性质，任何话语都不足以表达它们。这是因为人类话语出于由存在于尘世之光中的事物所形成的观念。从天堂之光所形成的观念远远比这些世俗观念优越得多，以致任何话语都无法表达它们，它们仅在很小程度上在那些能将其心智从感官事物所形成的观念中抽离出来之人的思维中找到一席之地。</p>

And the sons of Zilpah Leah's handmaid, Gad and Asher. That this signifies those which are of service to exterior goods and truths, is evident from the representation of Zilpah Leah's handmaid, as being 
the subsequent affection that is of service as a means to the affection of exterior truth (see n. 3835). A "handmaid" denotes a means that is of service for conjunction (as just above, n. 4608), and 
her "sons" denote such means, the essential things of which are represented by Gad and Asher; by Gad in the supreme sense omnipotence and omniscience, in the internal sense the good of faith, and in 
the external sense works (n. 3934); by Asher in the supreme sense eternity, in the internal sense the happiness of eternal life, and in the external sense the delight of the affection (n. 3938, 3939). 
These are the things which the enumeration of the sons of Jacob at this time involves; but how they cohere together and one follows another, and one is contained within another, cannot be seen in the 
light of the world unless it is enlightened by the light of heaven. Yet the things which then appear are still such as not to fall into words, for human words are from ideas formed from the things 
which are in the light of the world. The ideas which are from the light of heaven transcend these to such a degree that they cannot be expressed, but only to some extent thought of by those to whom it 
has been given to withdraw their mind from things of sense. </p>

'And the sons of Zilpah, Leah's servant-girl: Gad and Asher' means those that serve the exterior ones. This is clear from the representation of 'Zilpah, Leah's servant-girl' as a secondary affection 
which, as a means, serves the affection for exterior truth, dealt with in <a href="3835.htm">3835</a>, 'a servant-girl' being a means that serves to effect a joining together, as immediately above in <a href="4608.htm">4608</a>. Her 'sons' are the 
same kinds of means, the essential characteristics of which are represented by 'Gad and Asher' In the highest sense 'Gad' means Omnipotence and Omniscience, in the internal sense the good of faith, 
and in the external sense works, <a href="3934.htm">3934</a>, while 'Asher' in the highest sense means eternity, in the internal sense the happiness of eternal life, and in the external sense the delight that belongs to affection, <a href="3938.htm">3938</a>, <a href="3939.htm">3939</a>. These are the matters implied in the listing of Jacob's sons at this point. But how they all fit together, one following another and one included within another, cannot be seen in 
the light of the world unless this light is brightened by the light of heaven. Yet even then the things that can be seen are such that no words are adequate to express them. This is because human words 
are the product of ideas formed from things that exist within the light of the world. But ideas that are formed from the light of heaven are so superior to those worldly ideas that no words exist to 
express them, though they do to a small extent find a place in the thinking of people who are enabled to separate their minds from ideas formed from the senses. </p>

`Et filii Zilpae ancillae Leae, Gad et Asher' quod significet exterioribus inservientia, constat ex repraesentatione `Zilpae ancillae Leae' quod sit affectio sequens inserviens affectioni veri exterioris 
pro medio, de qua n. 3835; `ancilla' est medium inserviens conjunctioni, ut `mox' supra n. 4608; `filii ejus' sunt talia media quorum essentialia repraesentantur per Gadem et Asherem; per 
`Gadem' in supremo sensu omnipotentia et omniscientia, in interno bonum fidei, et in externo opera, n. 3934; </p>
<p>per {1} `Asherem' in supremo sensu aeternitas, in interno felicitas vitae aeternae, in externo 
jucundum affectionis, n. 3938, 3939.  Haec sunt quae involvit recensio filiorum Jacobi nunc; sed quomodo cohaerent ac unum sequitur alterum, et unum continetur in altero, non videri potest in 
luce mundi, nisi haec illustrata sit a luce caeli; at quae tunc apparent, usque sunt talia quae non cadunt in voces; voces enim humanae sunt ex ideis formatis ab illis quae sunt in luce mundi, has 
transcendunt ideae quae sunt ex luce caeli in tantum ut exprimi nequeant, sed {2} modo quoad partem cogitari ab illis quibus datum est mentem a sensualibus abducere.      @1 i et$      @2 i cogitari 
quidem aliqualiter potest, quomodo se habent. This is underlined in A, and the underlining may either have been meant for deletion, or taken as such in copying$ </p>
