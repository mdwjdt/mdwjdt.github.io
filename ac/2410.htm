<h3 align="center" class="ired">属天的奥秘 第2410节</h3>
<h4 align="center"></h4><p><strong>2410.</strong>“他迟延不走”表由邪恶的本质所导致的不情愿。这从前面所述（<a href="2406.htm">2406</a>节）清楚可知；因为人里面的邪恶不断反对来自主的良善。人的思维，甚至最细微的思维都粘附着遗传和实际所行的邪恶。这恶把他拖下来，但主凭借祂所注入的良善拦阻他、提升他，以此将人保持在恶与善之间。因此，若非主时刻拦阻他，使他远离邪恶，他凭自己必一头冲下去；比起以前的状态，人处于在此罗得所代表的教会成员所在的状态更会这么做。这种状态是他开始不再象通过真理那样通过良善思考和行事之时的状态，所以有点远离良善。</p>

And he lingered. That this signifies opposition arising from the nature of evil, is evident from what was said above (n. 2406); for the evil which is in man continually reacts against the good which 
is from the Lord. Evil from what is hereditary and from what is actual adheres to man in each of His thoughts, nay, in the least things of his thoughts. This drags him downward (but the Lord, by means 
of the good which he instills, withholds him, and uplifts Him, so that the man is held suspended between evil and good), and the consequence of this downward tendency is that if even for the least moment 
the man were not withheld from evils, he would of himself rush downward; and this he would do more in the state in which is the man of the church now represented by Lot than in the former state. 
This state is that he is beginning to think and to act not so much from good as from truth; thus at some distance from good. </p>

That 'he lingered' means reluctance caused by the nature of evil is clear from what has been stated above in <a href="2406.htm">2406</a>; for the evil that is within man reacts all the time against the good which comes from 
the Lord. Evil arising from what is hereditary and from his own actions clings to man in each one of his thoughts, indeed in the least parts of thoughts. This evil drags him down, but the Lord withholds 
him and uplifts him by means of the good that He implants. In this way man is kept suspended between evil and good, and therefore if for one fraction of a moment the Lord did not withhold him from 
evils he would of himself rush in a downward direction, all the more so in this state which the member of the Church whom Lot at this point represents is experiencing than in the previous state. The 
present state is a state when he starts to think and act not so much from good as from truth, and so is somewhat removed from good. </p>

</p><b>2410.</b>
`Et moratus': quod significet repugnantiam ex natura mali, constat ex illis quae supra n. 2406 dicta sunt: malum enim quod in homine, continue reagit contra bonum quod a Domino, adhaerescit malum ex 
hereditario et ex actuali homini in singulis ejus cogitationibus, immo in cogitationum minimus; hoc trahit eum deorsum, Dominus autem per bonum quod insinuat, detinet eum et tollit eum; ita suspensus 
tenetur homo inter malum et bonum, quare si vel minimo momento non (t)a Domino detineretur a malis, ex se rueret deorsum; et hoc magis in hoc statu in quo homo Ecclesiae quem `Lot' nunc repraesentat 
quam in statu priore; status ille est quod non ita ex bono quam e vero incipiat cogitare et agere, sic e distantia quadam a bono. </p>
