<h3 align="center" class="ired">属天的奥秘 第3600节</h3>
<h4 align="center"></h4><p><strong>3600.</strong>“看哪，你的住处必有地上的肥土”表从神圣良善所接受的生命；“天上的甘露”表它来自神圣真理。这从“肥土”、“住处”和“天上的甘露”的含义清楚可知：“肥土”是指良善（<a href="353.htm">353</a>节），在此是指神圣良善，因为它论及主；“住处”是指生活或生命（参看<a href="1293.htm">1293</a>，<a href="3384.htm">3384</a>节），因为“住处”涉及良善（<a href="2268.htm">2268</a>，<a href="2451.htm">2451</a>，<a href="2712.htm">2712</a>节）；“天上的甘露”是指源于平安和纯真状态的良善的真理（<a href="3579.htm">3579</a>节），在此是指神圣真理，因为它论及主。类似的话也对雅各说过，即“愿神赐你天上的甘露、地上的肥土”（28节）。但那里先提及的是“甘露”，因而是真理；其次提及的是“肥土”，因而是良善；并且雅各还被告知，神要将这些事物赐给他。而此处涉及以扫时，先提及的是“肥土”，因而是良善；其次提及的是“天上的甘露”，因而是真理。但他没有被告知神会赐给他这些东西，而是被告知，他的住处必有这些事物。由此也明显可知，“雅各”代表真理，“以扫”代表良善；而且这真理一开始看似占据优先位置，但如早已多次说明的，这一个颠倒的次序。</p>

Behold of the fat things of the earth shall be thy dwelling. That this signifies that life is from Divine good; and that "of the dew of heaven from above" signifies that it is from Divine truth, is evident 
from the signification of "fatness," as being good (n. 353), here, Divine good, because it is spoken of the Lord; and from the signification of "dwelling," as being life (see above, n. 1293, 3384), 
and that "dwelling" is predicated of good (n. 2268, 2451, 2712); and from the signification of the "dew of heaven," as being truth derived from the good of a state of peace and innocence (n. 3579), 
here, Divine truth, because it is spoken of the Lord. Similar words were spoken to Jacob, namely, "God shall give thee of the dew of heaven and of the fat things of the earth" (verse 28) but there 
"dew" (thus truth) is spoken of in the first place; and the "fat things of the earth" (thus good) in the second; and also that "God should give" of them; whereas here in relation to Esau, the "fat things 
of the earth" (thus good) are spoken of in the first place; and in the second place the "dew of heaven" (thus truth); and it is not said that "God would give," but that "his dwelling should be of 
them;" which also shows that Jacob represents truth, and Esau good; also that truth as apparently in the former place is first; but that this is the inverse of order, according to what has already been 
frequently shown. </p>

<p align="center"><b>Elliott(1983-1999) 3600</b></p><p><b>3600.</b>
'Behold, of the fatness of the land will be your dwelling-place' means life received from Divine Good; 'and of the dew of heaven from above' means from Divine Truth. This is clear from the meaning of 
'fatness' as good, dealt with in <a href="353.htm">353</a>, in this case Divine Good since it is used in regard to the Lord; from the meaning of 'dwelling-place' as life, dealt with in <a href="1293.htm">1293</a>, <a href="3384.htm">3384</a>, for 'dwelling-place' has 
reference to good, <a href="2268.htm">2268</a>, <a href="2451.htm">2451</a>, <a href="2712.htm">2712</a>; and from the meaning of 'the dew of heaven' as truth coming from good which is the product of a state of peace and innocence, dealt with above in <a href="3579.htm">3579</a>, in this case 
Divine Truth since it is used in regard to the Lord. Similar things had been told to Jacob, that is to say, 'God will give to you of the dew of heaven, and of the fatness of the land', in verse 28 
above. There however 'the dew', and so truth, is mentioned first, and 'the fatness of the land', and so good, second Jacob was also told that 'God would give of' these things to him. Here however Esau 
is first told about 'the fatness of the land', and so about good, and secondly about 'the dew of heaven', and so about truth. He is not told however that 'God would give of' these, but that 'of them 
would his dwelling-place be'. From this it is also evident that 'Jacob' represents truth and 'Esau' good, and also that truth apparently occupies the prior position at first, which is a reversal of order, 
as accords with what has been shown many times already. </p>

Quod `ecce de pinguedinibus terrae habitatio tua' significet quod ex Divino Bono vita; et quod `de rore caeli desuper' significet quod ex Divino Vero, constat a significatione {1}`pinguedinis' quod 
sit bonum, de qua n. 353, hic Divinum Bonum quia dicitur de Domino; ex significatione `habitationis' quod sit vita, de qua n. 1293, 3384; et quod `habitatio' praedicetur de bono, n. 2268, 2451, 2712; 
et ex significatione `roris caeli' quod sit verum quod {2}ex bono status pacis et innocentiae, de qua supra n. 3579, hic Divinum Verum quia dicitur de Domino.  Ad Jacobum similia dicta sunt, nempe, `dabit 
tibi Deus de rore caeli, et de pinguedinibus terrae,' supra vers. 28, sed ibi primo loco dictum {3}de `rore' ita de vero, et secundo de `pinguedinibus terrae,' ita de bono', et quoque quod `Deus 
(x)ei de illis daret'; hic autem ad Esavum dicitur primo loco de `pinguedinibus terrae' ita de bono, et secundo de `rore caeli' ita de vero, et non quod `Deus daret,' sed quod `habitatio ejus erit de 
illis'; inde quoque patet quod `Jacobus' repraesentet verum et `Esau' bonum, tum quod verum apparenter priore loco sit primum, et quod id inversum ordinis sit, secundum illa quae pluries prius ostensa 
sunt. @1 pinguedinum$ @2 ex statu pacis$ @3 i est$ </p>
