<h4 align="center"></h4><p><strong>8191.</strong>出埃及记14:19-22.神的使者启程，在以色列营前面行走，转到他们后边去；云柱也从他们前面启程，立在他们后面。它来到埃及人的营和以色列营之间；它是云和黑暗，照亮黑夜；终夜彼此不得接近。摩西向海伸手；耶和华便终夜用极强的东风，使海退去，使海成了干地，水也裂开了。以色列人进到海中间的干地上，水在他们的左右给他们作了墙垣。<br />“神的使者启程”表神性真理的重新有序安排。“在以色列营前面行走”表在教会的真理和良善周围的。“转到他们后边去”表保护，以免邪恶的虚假流入意愿。“云柱也从他们前面启程，立在他们后面”表主的同在保护意愿的事物，就像之前保护理解力的事物一样。“它来到埃及人的营和以色列营之间”表在这一方的邪恶之虚假和那一方的良善之真理之间。“它是云和黑暗”表这一方的邪恶所生的虚假加剧。“照亮黑夜”那一方的源于良善的真理变得更加光明。“彼此不得接近”表结果没有任何交流。“终夜”表在模糊的状态下。“摩西向海伸手”表神之真理向地狱行使能力。“耶和华便用极强的东风，使海退去”表驱散虚假所用的手段。“终夜”表在模糊的状态下。“使海成了干地”表驱散虚假。“水也裂开了”表与真理分离，以及移除。“以色列人进到海中间的干地上”表那些属于属灵教会的人进入地狱，并且他们安全通过地狱，没有虚假流入。“水在他们的左右给他们作了墙垣”表他们被阻离四面八方的虚假。</p>

Verses 19-22. And the angel of God set out, marching before the camp of Israel, and he went behind them; and the pillar of cloud set out from before them and stood behind them; and it came between the 
camp of the Egyptians and the camp of Israel; and it was a cloud and darkness, and it lighted up the night; and the one came not near the other all the night. And Moses stretched out his hand over the 
sea; and Jehovah made the sea go away by a strong east wind all night, and made the sea dry, and the waters were cleft asunder. And the sons of Israel came into the midst of the sea in the dry; and 
the waters were a wall to them on their right hand, and on their left. "And the angel of God set out," signifies a setting in order by Divine truth; "marching before the camp of Israel," signifies that 
was around the truths and goods of the church; "and he went behind them," signifies protection lest the falsity of evil should flow into the will; "and the pillar of cloud set out from before them 
and stood behind them," signifies the presence of the Lord protecting the things of the will, as it had previously protected those of the understanding; "and it came between the camp of the Egyptians 
and the camp of Israel," signifies between the falsities of evil on the one side, and the truths of good on the other; "and it was a cloud and darkness," signifies the condensation of falsity from evil 
on the one side; "and it lighted up the night," signifies the enlightenment of truth from good on the other; "and the one came not near the other," signifies consequently no communication; "all the 
night," signifies in the obscure state; "and Moses stretched out his hand over the sea," signifies the rule of the power of truth Divine over hell; "and Jehovah made the sea go away by a strong east wind," 
signifies the means of the dissipation of falsity; "all the night," signifies in the obscure state; "and made the sea dry," signifies the dissipation of falsity; "and the waters were cleft asunder," 
signifies separation from truths, and removal; "and the sons of Israel came into the midst of the sea in the dry," signifies the entrance and passage of those who were of the spiritual church through 
hell in safety, and without any influx of falsity; "and the waters were a wall to them on their right hand, and on their left," signifies that they were withheld from falsities on every side. </p>

Verses 19-22 And the angel of God travelled on, marching before the camp of Israel; and he went behind them. And the pillar of cloud travelled from before them and stood behind them. And it came between 
the camp of the Egyptians and the camp of Israel; and it was cloud and darkness [for the former], and it lit up the night [for the latter]. And the latter did not come near the former the whole night. 
And Moses stretched out his hand over the sea, and Jehovah caused the sea to go away by a strong east wind the whole night, and made the sea into dry ground; and the waters were divided. And the 
children of Israel came into the middle of the sea on dry ground; and the waters were a wall for them on their right and on their left. </p>
<p>'And the angel of God travelled on' means rearrangement by Divine 
Truth. 'Marching before the camp of Israel' means which involved the Church's truths and forms of good. 'And he went behind them' means protection to prevent the inflow of the falsity of evil into 
the will. 'And the pillar of cloud travelled from before them and stood behind them' means the Lord's presence protecting things of the will as it had previously protected those of the understanding. 
'And it came between the camp of the Egyptians and the camp of Israel' means that it came between the falsities of evil on the one side and the truths of good on the other. 'And it was cloud and darkness 
[for the former]' means that the falsity arising from evil on the one side was intensified. 'And it lit up the night [for the latter]' means that the truth springing from good on the other side 
was lightened. 'And the latter did not come near the former' means that as a result no communication took place. 'The whole night' means in the state of obscurity. 'And Moses stretched out his hand over 
the sea' means the exercising of power by God's truth over hell. 'And Jehovah caused the sea to go away by a strong east wind' means the agent through which falsity was dispersed. 'The whole night' 
means in the state of obscurity. 'And made the sea into dry ground' means the dispersing of falsity. 'And the waters were divided' means separation from truths, and removal. 'And the children of Israel 
came into the middle of the sea on dry ground' means the entrance into hell by those who belonged to the spiritual Church and their passage through it in safety and without falsity flowing in. 'And 
the waters were a wall for them on their right and on their left' means that they were held back from falsities on every side. </p>

Vers. 19-22.  Et profectus angelus Dei incedens ante castra Israelis, et ivit post illos, et profecta columna nubis ab ante illos, et stetit post illos.  Et venit inter castra Aegyptiorum et inter castra 
Israelis, et fuit nubes et tenebrae, et illuminabat noctem; et non appropinquavit hic ad illum tota nocte.  Et extendit Moscheh manum suam super mare, et abire fecit Jehovah mare vento orientali 
forti tota nocte, et posuit mare ad siccum, et diffindebantur aquae.  Et venerunt filii Israelis in medium mare in arido; et aquae illis murus a dextra illorum et a sinistra illorum.  `Et profectus angelus 
Dei' significat ordinationem a Divino Vero: `incedens ante castra Israelis' significat quae circa vera et bona Ecclesiae: `et ivit post illos' significat tutationem ne falsum mali in voluntarium 
influeret: `et profecta columna nubis ab ante illos, et stetit post illos' significat praesentiam Domini tutantem voluntaria sicut prius intellectualia: `et venit inter castra Aegyptiorum et inter castra 
Israelis' significat quod inter falsa mali ab una parte, et {1}vera boni ab altera: `et fuit nubes et tenebrae' significat condensationem falsi ex malo ab una parte: `et illuminabat noctem' significat 
illustrationem veri ex bono ab altera: `et non appropinquavit hic ad illum' significat inde nullam communicationem: `tota nocte' significat in statu obscuro: `et extendit Moscheh manum suam super 
mare' significat dominium potentiae veri Divini super infernum: `et abire fecit Jehovah mare vento orientali forti' significat medium dissipationis falsi: `tota nocte' significat in statu obscuro: 
`et posuit mare ad siccum' significat falsi dissipationem: `et diffindebantur aquae' significat separationem a veris, et remotionem: `et venerunt filii Israelis in medium mare in arido' significat ingressum 
et transitum illorum qui ab Ecclesia spirituali tuto per infernum, et absque influxu falsi: `et aquae illis murus a dextra illorum et a sinistra illorum' significat quod a falsis detenti fuerint 
undequaque. 	@1 n. 8196 has bona veri$ </p>
