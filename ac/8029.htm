<h3 align="center" class="ired">属天的奥秘 第8029节</h3>
<h4 align="center"></h4><p><strong>8029.</strong>从数次所提到的关于人死后状态的事清楚可知，很少有人一进入来世就直接进入天堂；相反，人们会在天堂下面停留一段时间，好叫他们从世界所带来的尘世和肉体之爱的污秽能被抹除，他们以这种方式可以做好预备，并能融入到天使当中。所有星球的人都有这种经历；也就是说，他们首先在天堂之下的灵人当中；后来，当做好预备时，他们就变成天使。当木星灵正在变成天使时，我蒙允许看见所发生的事。像火一样明亮的马出现了，他们就像以利亚一样被这些马接走。像火一样的马表示一种被启示或光照的理解力。在圣言中，“马”表示理解力（参看<a href="2760.htm">2760</a>-<a href="2762.htm">2762</a>，<a href="3217.htm">3217</a>，<a href="5321.htm">5321</a>，<a href="6125.htm">6125</a>，<a href="6534.htm">6534</a>节）。接走以利亚的“火马火车”表示对圣言内在内容的理解（<a href="2762.htm">2762</a>节）。</p>

From what has already been occasionally related about the state of man after death, it is evident that there are few who at once enter heaven when they come into the other life; but that they stay for 
some time beneath heaven, in order that the things belonging to earthly and bodily loves, which they have brought with them from the world, may be removed, and they may thus be prepared to be capable 
of being in society with the angels. The case is similar with the men of all the earths, namely, that after their decease they are at first beneath heaven among spirits; and afterward, when they are 
prepared, they become angels. When the spirits of that earth were becoming angels it was given me to see that there appeared bright horses as of fire, by which they were carried up, like Elijah. Bright 
horses as of fire signify an enlightened understanding (that "horses" in the Word signify what is of the understanding, see n. 2760-2762, 3217, 5321, 6125, 6534); and the "horses of fire and chariots 
of fire" which carried away Elijah, signify the understanding of the Word as to its interiors (n. 2762). </p>

From what has been mentioned several times already about a person's state after death it is clear that those who go straight to heaven when they enter the next life are few. Instead people stay for some 
time beneath heaven, in order that the defilements of earthly and bodily kinds of love, which they have brought with them from the world, may be wiped away, and in that way they may be prepared and 
enabled to be integrated among angels. This kind of experience is undergone by people belonging to all planets. That is to say, after death they are first below heaven among spirits; but subsequently, 
when they have undergone preparation, they become angels. I was allowed to see what happened when spirits belonging to that planet became angels. Bright horses as if of fire appeared, and these took 
them away in the same manner as Elijah was taken, the bright horses as if of fire serving to mean an enlightened understanding. In the Word horses mean the power of understanding, see <a href="2760.htm">2760</a>-<a href="2762.htm">2762</a>, <a href="3217.htm">3217</a>, <a href="5321.htm">5321</a>, <a href="6125.htm">6125</a>, <a href="6534.htm">6534</a>; and 'the fiery horses' and 'the fiery chariots' that took Elijah away mean an understanding of the inner contents of the Word, <a href="2761.htm">2761</a>. </p>

</p><b>8029.</b>
Ex illis quae aliquoties prius {1}memorata sunt de statu hominis post mortem, constat quod pauci sint qui, cum in alteram vitam veniunt, ilico intrent caelum, sed quod infra caelum commorentur aliquo 
tempore, ut illa quae sunt amorum terrestrium et corporeorum, quae secum e mundo tulerunt, abstergantur, (c)et sic praeparentur ut in societate cum angelis possint esse; similiter fit cum hominibus 
omnium tellurum, nempe quod post decessum {2} sint primum infra caelum inter spiritus, et postea, cum praeparati, fiant angeli; datum est videre, cum spiritus illius telluris fiebant angeli; apparuerunt 
equi lucidi sicut ignei, a quibus, similiter ac Elias, auferebantur; `equi lucidi sicut ignei' significant intellectum illustratum; quod equi in Verbo significent intellectuale, videatur n. 2760-2762, 
3217, 5321, 6125, 6534; et quod `equi ignei (c)et currus ignei qui auferebant Eliam' intellectum Verbi quoad ejus interiora, n. 2762. 	@1 After mortem$ 	@2 i seu obitum$ </p>
