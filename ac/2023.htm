<h3 align="center" class="ired">属天的奥秘 第2023节</h3>
<h4 align="center"></h4><p><strong>2023.</strong>“随从你的你的种”表信祂之人所具有的神性即源于此。这从“种”和“随从你”的含义清楚可知：“种”是指仁之信（参看<a href="1025.htm">1025</a>，<a href="1447.htm">1447</a>，<a href="1610.htm">1610</a>节）；“随从你”是指要跟从祂，如刚才所解释的（<a href="2019.htm">2019</a>节）。那些信主之人所拥有的神性就是爱与仁。“爱”是指对主之爱，“仁”是指对邻之爱。对主之爱决不可能与对邻之爱分离，因为主的爱针对全人类，祂愿意永远拯救他们，并将其与祂自己完全结合起来，以致没有一个人会灭亡。因此，凡爱主之人都拥有主的爱，从而必然爱他的邻舍。<br />但是，拥有对邻之爱的人并不全都因此拥有对主之爱。如善良的外邦人，尽管他们对主一无所知，但主仍在仁爱中与他们同在，如第一卷所示（<a href="1032.htm">1032</a>，<a href="1059.htm">1059</a>节）。这也适用于教会内的其他人，因为对主之爱等级较高。凡拥有对主之爱的，都是属天之人；凡拥有对邻之爱的，都是属灵之人。大洪水前的上古教会是属天的，拥有对主之爱；大洪水后的古教会是属灵的，拥有对邻之爱，或仁爱。等到后面提到爱与仁时，我们就会注意到它们之间的这种区别。</p>

And to thy seed after thee. That this signifies the Divine thence derived with those who have faith in Him, is evident from the signification of "seed," as being the faith of charity (see n. 1025, 1447, 
1610); and also from the signification of "after thee," as being to follow Him (explained just above, n. 2019). The Divine with those who have faith in the Lord is love and charity. By Love is meant 
love to the Lord; by Charity,"," love toward the neighbor. Love to the Lord cannot possibly be separated from love toward the neighbor; for the Lord's love is toward the universal human race, which 
He wills to save eternally and to adjoin wholly to Himself, so that not one of them may perish. He therefore who has love to the Lord, has the Lord's love, and thereby can do no otherwise than love his 
neighbor.  [2] But they who are in love toward the neighbor are not all for that reason in love to the Lord, as for example the well-disposed Gentiles who are in ignorance respecting the Lord, but 
with whom the Lord is nevertheless present in charity (as shown in Part First, n. 1032, 1059), and also others within the church; for love to the Lord is in a higher degree. They who have love to the 
Lord are celestial men, but they who have love toward the neighbor, or charity, are spiritual men. The Most Ancient Church, which was before the flood, and was celestial, was in love to the Lord, but 
the Ancient Church, which was after the flood, and was spiritual, was in love toward the neighbor, or in charity. This distinction between Love and Charity will be observed when they are mentioned hereafter. </p>

<p align="center"><b>Elliott(1983-1999) 2023</b></p><p><b>2023.</b>
'And to your seed after you' means the Divine from that source with those who have faith in Him. This is clear from the meaning of 'seed' as the faith that inheres in charity, dealt with in <a href="1025.htm">1025</a>, <a href="1447.htm">1447</a>, <a href="1610.htm">1610</a>, and also from the meaning of 'after you' as following Him, dealt with just above in <a href="2019.htm">2019</a>. The Divine as it resides with those who have faith in Him is love and charity - love to the Lord being 
understood by 'love', and love towards the neighbour by 'charity'. Love to the Lord cannot possibly be separated from love towards the neighbour, for the Lord's love is directed towards the whole human 
race whom He wishes to save eternally and to join so completely to Himself that not a single one of them perishes. Anyone therefore who has love to the Lord possesses the Lord's love and so cannot 
help loving the neighbour. </p>
<p></p>
<p><b>[2]</b>
 But not all people who are moved by love towards the neighbour are on that account moved by love to the Lord. This is so in the case of honest gentiles with whom, though 
they do not know the Lord, the Lord is nevertheless present in their charity, as shown in Volume One, in <a href="1032.htm">1032</a>, <a href="1059.htm">1059</a>. And this also applies to others inside the Church, for love to the Lord is of 
a higher order. People who have love to the Lord are celestial, but those who have love towards the neighbour, which is charity, are spiritual. The Most Ancient Church which existed before the Flood and 
was celestial was moved by love to the Lord, whereas the Ancient Church which existed after the Flood and was spiritual was moved by love towards the neighbour, which is charity. This distinction between 
love and charity will be maintained, when they are mentioned, in what follows. </p>

`Et semini tuo post te': quod significet inde Divinum apud eos qui fidem in Ipsum habent, constat ex significatione `Seminis' quod sit fides charitatis, de qua n. 1025, 1447, 1610: tum ex significatione 
`post te' quod sit sequi Ipsum, de qua mox supra n. 2019.  Divinum apud {1} illos qui fidem in Ipsum habent, est amor et charitas; per `amorem' intelligitur amor in Dominum; per `charitatem' amor 
erga proximum; amor Dominum nusquam (t)separari potest' ab amore erga proximum, nam amor Domini est erga universum genus humanum quod in aeternum salvare vult, et sibi prorsus adjungere ut nullus eorum 
pereat; quare qui habet amorem in Dominum, is habet amorem Domine, et sic non aliter potest quam amare proximum; [2] sed qui in amore erga proximum sunt, non ideo omnes sunt in amore in Dominum, sicut 
gentes probae quae in ignorantia sunt de Domino, apud quas usque Dominus in charitate praesens est, ut ostensum in Parte Prima n. 1032, 1059; tum etiam alii intra Ecclesiam; nam amor in Dominum est 
in gradu superiore: qui amorem habent in Dominum, sunt caelestes homines, at qui amorem erga proximum seu charitatem, sunt spirituales; Antiquissima Ecclesia quae post ante diluvium et caelestis spirituales, 
in amore in Dominum fuit; Antiqua vero Ecclesia quae post diluvium et spiritualis fuit, in amore erga proximum seu in charitate fuit: haec distinctio inter amorem et charitatem erit in sequentibus, 
quando nominantur. 	@1 i quod.$ </p>
