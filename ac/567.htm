<h4 align="center"></h4><p><strong>567.</strong>犹太教会所在之地，整个地区都被称为教会区域，被教导真正的信之教义的人们生活在那里，如迦南地，现在基督教会所在的欧洲。它们之外的陆地或地区不是教会区域，或“土地”。大洪水前的教会所在之地，可通过被从伊甸园流出的河所环绕的陆地清楚看出，圣言中频繁提及的河表示迦南陆地的边界。大洪水之前，它坐落的地方从下文，如，通过论及伟人在地上也清楚可知。那时他们出现在迦南的陆地，这一点从民数记（<a href="http://39-27.cn/民13.33.htm">13:33</a>）上提到说亚衲族人的后代出自伟人清楚看出来。</p>

<p><strong>[NCE]567.</strong> The whole region encompassing those who have learned what is taught about true faith is called the church's territory. The land of Canaan was one such place during the time the Jewish church was there. Europe, where the Christian church now exists, is another. The lands and regions outside this are not the church's territory, meaning they are not the face of the ground.<br />Just where that territory was before the Flood can be seen from the lands circled by the rivers that came from the Garden of Eden — rivers that the Word frequently describes as marking the boundaries of the land of Canaan [<a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_567/bible_king-james-version_genesis_15_18" target=_top>Genesis 15:18</a>; <a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_567/bible_king-james-version_deuteronomy_1_7" target=_top>Deuteronomy 1:7</a>; <a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_567/bible_king-james-version_deuteronomy_11_24" target=_top>11:24</a>; <a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_567/bible_king-james-version_joshua_1_4" target=_top>Joshua 1:4</a>; <a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_567/bible_king-james-version_1-chronicles_5_9" target=_top>1 Chronicles 5:9</a>]. Its location can also be determined from what follows, such as the fact that the Nephilim were in the land; and the land they were in was Canaan, as established by the presence of the children of Anak, who were some of the Nephilim (<a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_567/bible_king-james-version_numbers_13_33" target=_top>Numbers 13:33</a>). </p>
<p align="center"><b>Potts(1905-1910) 567</b></p><p><b>567.</b>
All that region is called the region of the church where those live who are instructed in the doctrine of true faith; as the land of Canaan, when the Jewish Church was there, and Europe, where the Christian 
Church now is; the lands and countries outside of this are not the region of the church, or the "faces of the ground." Where the church was before the flood, may also appear from the lands which 
the rivers encompassed that went forth from the garden of Eden, by which in various parts of the Word are likewise described the boundaries of the land of Canaan; and also from what follows concerning 
the Nephilim that were "in the land;" and that these Nephilim dwelt in the land of Canaan is evident from what is said of the sons of Anak: that they were "of the Nephilim" (Num. 13:33). </p>

<p align="center"><b>Elliott(1983-1999) 567</b></p><p><b>567.</b>
The whole of that region is called the area of the Church where people who have been instructed in the doctrine of true faith are situated, as the land of Canaan was when the Jewish Church was there, 
and as Europe is where the Christian Church is today. Lands or regions outside of them are not areas of the Church, or 'the face of the ground'. Where the Church existed prior to the Flood becomes clear 
also from the lands which were encompassed by the rivers flowing out of the garden of Eden, rivers which are also frequently described in the Word as the boundaries to the land of Canaan. Where it 
was situated prior to the Flood is also clear from what follows that description, for example, from the reference to the Nephilim being in the land, whose presence then in the land of Canaan is clear 
from the statement in <a href="http://bible.gospelcom.net/cgi-bin/bible?passage=Num%2013:33&amp;version=ESV&amp;interface=print&amp;showfn=yes&amp;showxref">Num 13:33</a> that the sons of Anak came from the Nephilim.  </p>

<p align="center"><b>Latin(1748-1756) 567</b>
</p><b>567.</b>
Omnis illa regio vocatur tractus Ecclesiae ubi illi sunt qui instructi in doctrina" verae fidei; sicut terra Canaan cum ibi Ecclesia Judaica; et sicut Europa ubi nunc Ecclesia Christiana; terrae et 
regiones quae extra sunt, non sunt tractus Ecclesiae, seu 'facies humi.' Ubinam ante diluvium fuit, etiam constare potest ex terris quas circumdabant fluvii exeuntes ex horto Edenis, per quos passim in 
Verbo quoque describuntur termini terrae Canaanis; tum ex iis quae sequuntur, ut a 'Nephilim in terra' qui quod in terra Canaane fuerint, constat a filiis Anaki quod fuerint ex Nephilim, Num. xiii 33. </p>
