<h3 align="center" class="ired">属天的奥秘 第3263节</h3>
<h4 align="center"></h4><p><strong>3263.</strong>“这些是亚伯拉罕的儿子以实玛利的后代”表由以实玛利所代表的属灵教会的衍生物。这从“后代”和“亚伯拉罕的儿子”的含义，以及“以实玛利”的代表清楚可知：“后代”是指信、因而教会的衍生物（参看<a href="1145.htm">1145</a>，<a href="1255.htm">1255</a>，<a href="1330.htm">1330</a>节）；“以实玛利”是指那些具有理性、属于主的属灵教会之人（参看<a href="2078.htm">2078</a>，<a href="2691.htm">2691</a>，<a href="2699.htm">2699</a>节）；“亚伯拉罕的儿子”是指那些通过主处于真理的人，因为“儿子”表真理（参看<a href="489.htm">489</a>，<a href="491.htm">491</a>，<a href="533.htm">533</a>，<a href="1147.htm">1147</a>，<a href="2623.htm">2623</a>节），“亚伯拉罕”还代表主的神性人（<a href="3251.htm">3251</a>节），属灵之人通过这神性人而拥有真理与良善（<a href="2661.htm">2661</a>，<a href="2716.htm">2716</a>，<a href="2833.htm">2833</a>，<a href="2834.htm">2834</a>节）。<br />至于主的属灵教会，要知道：它存在于全世界，因为它不是仅限于那些拥有圣言，并因此知道主和某些信之真理的人，也存在于那些没有圣言，因而完全不知道主，结果也不知道任何信之真理（因为一切信之真理都涉及主）的人身上。也就是说，该教会存在于远离教会的外邦人中。因为他们当中有许多人通过理性之光知道存在一位神，祂创造并维护万有；还知道一切良善、因而一切真理皆来自祂；成为祂的样式使人蒙福；而且他们照自己的宗教信仰生活在对那神之爱和对邻之爱中；他们出于对良善的情感而做善事，出于对真理的情感而敬拜那至高无上的存在。具有这种秉性的外邦人就属于主的属灵教会。尽管他们在世时不知道主，然而，当良善存在于他们里面时，他们仍拥有敬拜在里面，并默认主，因为主存在于一切良善中。因此，在来世，他们毫无困难地承认主，并且比不怎么具有良善的基督徒更容易接受信之真理。这一事实从记事中所披露的有关教会外各民族和人民在来世的状态和命运（<a href="2589.htm">2589</a>-<a href="2604.htm">2604</a>节）可以看出来。这些人所拥有的属世之光含有属灵之光在里面，因为没有从主所接受的属灵之光，这类真理根本不可能得到承认。<br />由此可见“以实玛利”表示什么，因而从代表意义上说，谁是“以实玛利人”，也就是那些属于主的属灵教会之人，他们过着简单的良善生活，并因此在教义方面处于属世真理。这种人还由下面关于约瑟的经文中所提到的“以实玛利人”来表示：<br />看哪，有一伙以实玛利人从基列来，他们的骆驼驮着香料、乳香、没药，要带下埃及去。（创世记<a href="http://39-27.cn/创37.25.htm">37:25</a>）<br />此处“以实玛利人”代表那些具有简单的良善之人，这类良善就是诸如存在于善良的外邦人身上那一种。“驮着香料、乳香、没药的骆驼”表这类人的内在良善。这一章的28节和39章1节，以及士师记中所提到的“以实玛利人”所表相同。在士师记，经上说，基甸提了一个要求：<br />请你们各人将所夺的耳环给我。原来他们都戴金耳环，因为他们是以实玛利人。（士师记<a href="http://39-27.cn/士8.24.htm">8:24</a>）<br />“金耳环”表构成简单良善的事物（<a href="3103.htm">3103</a>节）。</p>

And these are the births of Ishmael the son of Abraham. That this signifies the derivations of the spiritual church represented by Ishmael, is evident from the signification of "births," as being the 
derivations of faith, thus of the church (see n. 1145, 1255, 1330); from the representation of Ishmael, as being those who are rational and who are of the Lord's spiritual church (see n. 2078, 2691, 
2699); and from the signification of the "sons of Abraham," as being those who are in truth from the Lord; for by "sons" are signified truths (see n. 489, 491, 533, 1147, 2623), and by Abraham is represented 
the Lord as to the Divine Human also (n. 3251), from whom the spiritual have truth and good (n. 2661, 2716, 2833, 2834).  [2] As regards the Lord's spiritual church, be it known that it exists 
throughout the universal world; for it is not confined to those who have the Word and thence know the Lord and some truths of faith; but it exists also with those who have not the Word and therefore 
are altogether ignorant of the Lord and consequently know no truths of faith (for all the truths of faith regard the Lord); that is to say, this church exists among the Gentiles who are remote from the 
church; for there are many among them who from rational light know that there is one God; that He has created all things and preserves all things; and also that from Him is all good, consequently all 
truth; and that likeness to Him makes man blessed; and moreover they live according to their religion, in love to that God and in love toward the neighbor; and from the affection of good they do works 
of charity, and from the affection of truth they worship the Supreme Being. The Gentiles who are of this character are they who belong to the Lord's spiritual church; and although while in this world 
they do not know the Lord, yet within themselves they have the worship and tacit acknowledgment of Him when they are in good, for in all good the Lord is present; and therefore in the other life they 
easily acknowledge Him, and receive the truths of faith in Him more readily than Christians do who are not in good in this way, as may be seen from what has been disclosed from experience concerning 
the state and lot in the other life of the nations and peoples out of the church (n. 2589-2604). The natural light which these have has in it what is spiritual, for without that which is spiritual 
from the Lord, such things cannot possibly be acknowledged. [3] From this it may now be seen what "Ishmael" signifies, and thereby who in the representative sense are the "Ishmaelites," namely those 
who are of the Lord's spiritual church, who as to life are in simple good, and therefore as to doctrine are in natural truth. Such also are signified by the "Ishmaelites" in the following passage concerning 
Joseph: </p>
<p>     Behold, a travelling company of Ishmaelites came from Gilead, with their camels bearing wax, resin, and stacte, going to carry it down to Egypt (Gen. 37:25); </p>
<p>where the Ishmaelites 
represent those who are in simple good, such as is that in which are the well-disposed Gentiles; "camels bearing wax, resin, and stacte," denote the interior goods of such people. The like is signified 
by the "Ishmaelites" in verse 28 of the same chapter, and in chapter 39, verse 1; and also in the book of Judges, where it is said that Gideon made a request: </p>
<p>     That ye would give me every man 
the earrings of his spoil. For they had golden earrings, because they were Ishmaelites (Judg. 8:24); </p>
<p>"golden earrings" signify the things of simple good (n. 3103). </p>

'These are the generations of Ishmael, Abraham's son' means derivatives of the spiritual Church represented by Ishmael. This is clear from the meaning of 'generations' as derivatives of faith and so 
of the Church, dealt with in <a href="1145.htm">1145</a>, <a href="1255.htm">1255</a>, <a href="1330.htm">1330</a>; from the representation of 'Ishmael' as those who are rational, and who belong to the Lord's spiritual Church, dealt with in <a href="2078.htm">2078</a>, <a href="2691.htm">2691</a>, <a href="2699.htm">2699</a>; and from the 
meaning of Abraham's sons as those with whom truth from the Lord is present, for 'sons' means truths, <a href="489.htm">489</a>, <a href="491.htm">491</a>, <a href="533.htm">533</a>, <a href="1147.htm">1147</a>, <a href="2623.htm">2623</a>, and 'Abraham' represents the Lord, even as to the Divine Human, <a href="3251.htm">3251</a>, 
the source of truth and good received by those who are spiritual, <a href="2661.htm">2661</a>, <a href="2716.htm">2716</a>, <a href="2833.htm">2833</a>, <a href="2834.htm">2834</a>. </p>
<p></p>
<p><b>[2]</b>
 As regards the Lord's spiritual Church it should be realized that it exists throughout the whole world, 
for it is not confined to those who possess the Word and from the Word have knowledge of the Lord and of some truths of faith. It also exists among those who do not possess the Word and therefore do 
not know the Lord at all, and as a consequence have no knowledge of any truths of faith - for all truths of faith regard the Lord. That is, it exists with gentiles remote from the Church. For among 
those people there are many who know from the light of reason that there is one God, that He has created and preserves all things; and also that He is the source of everything good, and consequently of 
everything true; and that being the likeness of Him makes a person blessed. And what is more, they live up to their religion, in love to that God and in love towards the neighbour. From an affection 
for good they perform the works of charity, and from an affection for truth they worship the Supreme Being. Such people among the gentiles belong to the Lord's spiritual Church. And although they do 
not know the Lord while they are in the world they nevertheless have within themselves a worship and virtual acknowledgement of Him when good exists within them, for the Lord is present within all good. 
For this reason also they acknowledge the Lord in the next life without difficulty, and receive the truths of faith better than Christians do in whom good is not so much present, as may be seen from 
what has been disclosed from experience about the state and condition in the next life of nations and peoples outside the Church, in <a href="2589.htm">2589</a>-<a href="2604.htm">2604</a>. Their natural light present in their minds holds spiritual 
light within it, for without spiritual light received from the Lord such truths cannot possibly be acknowledged. </p>

<p><b>[3]</b>
 From this it may now become clear what Ishmael means, and therefore what the 
Ishmaelites mean, in the representative sense - those belonging to the Lord's spiritual Church who lead lives of simple goodness and therefore rely on natural truth for doctrine. Such people are also 
meant by the Ishmaelites in the following statement regarding Joseph, </p>
<blockquote>
Behold, a band of Ishmaelites came from Gilead, and their camels bearing wax, resin, and stacte, taking them down into Egypt. 
<a href="http://bible.gospelcom.net/cgi-bin/bible?passage=Gen%2037:25&amp;version=ESV&amp;interface=print&amp;showfn=yes&amp;showxref">Gen 37:25</a>. 
</blockquote>
<p>Here 'Ishmaelites' stands for those in whom simple good is present, such as exists with upright gentiles. 'Camels bearing wax, resin, and stacte' stands for the interior goods of such 
people. The same is meant by the Ishmaelites mentioned in verse 28 of that chapter, and in 39:1, as well as in the Book of Judges, in the reference to Gideon's requesting everyone to give him the earrings 
of his spoil, for being indeed Ishmaelites they had gold earrings, Judg. 8:24. 'Gold earrings' means the things that constitute simple good, <a href="3103.htm">3103</a>. </p>

`Hae nativitates Jishmaelis filii Abrahami': quod significet derivationes Ecclesiae spiritualis per Jishmaelem repraesentatae, constat ex significatione `nativitatum' quod sint derivationes fidei, ita 
Ecclesiae, de qua n.1145, 1255, 1330; ex repraesentatione `Jishmaelis' quod sint rationales, et qui ab Ecclesia spirituali Domini, de qua n. 2078, 2691, 2699; et ex significatione `filiorum Abrahami' 
quod sint illi qui in vero a Domino, per `filios' enim significantur vera, n. 489, 491, 533, 1147, 2623; et per `Abrahamum' repraesentatur Dominus, etiam quoad Divinum Humanum, n. 3251, a Quo verum

et inde norunt Dominum et aliqua vera fidei; sed etiam est apud illos qui Verbum non habent, et ideo prorsus ignorant Dominum, et consequenter non sciunt aliqua vera fidei, (omnia enim vera fidei spectant 
Dominum:) {1}hoc est, apud gentes ab Ecclesia remotas; sunt {2}enim plures inter illos, qui norunt ex lumine rationali, quod unus Deus sit, quod Ille creaverit omnia, et quod conservet omnia,

ex affectione boni faciunt opera charitatis, et ex affectione veri colunt Supremum; qui tales inter gentes, sunt qui in Ecclesia Domini spirituali sunt; et tametsi ignorant Dominum cum in mundo sunt, 
usque in se habent cultum Ipsius ac tacitam agnitionem, cum in bono sunt, in omni enim bono est Dominus praesens; quapropter etiam illi in altera vita facile Ipsum agnoscunt, et prae Christianis qui 
non ita in bono, vera fidei in Ipsum recipiunt, ut constare potest ex illis quae de gentium et populorum statu et sorte extra Ecclesiam in altera vita, n. 2589-2604, ab experientia {3}detecta sunt: lumen 
naturale quod illis, in se habet spirituale, nam absque spirituali quod a Domino, talia nusquam agnosci possunt. [3] Exinde nunc constare potest quid Jishmael, proinde quid Jishmaelitae, in sensu
