<h3 align="center" class="ired">属天的奥秘 第4524节</h3>
<h4 align="center"></h4><p><strong>4524.</strong>由于存在于这个世界和自然系统中的每一个事物都从先于它自己的某种事物产生，并不断产生，也就是持续存在，故可知，它从一个高于自然系统的世界产生并持续存在，这个世界就被称为灵界。并且，由于为让它们能持续存在或不断产生，与这个世界的一个持续联系必须存在，故可知，存在于自然界、因而存在于人里面的更纯粹、更内在之物皆源于这个世界；而且更纯粹、更内在的事物就是诸如能接受这个流注的那类形式。但由于生命只能有一个源头，就像在自然界中，光与热只有一个源头那样，故显而易见，生命的一切皆来源于主，也就是那生命的首要源头。既然如此，那么可知，存在于灵界中的每一个事物都对应于祂，因而人里面的每一个事物也对应于祂；因为人就是一个最小形式的微型灵界。因此，属灵人也是主的一个形像。</p>

Now as all and each of the things in the world and its nature come forth, and come forth perpetually, that is, subsist, from things prior to themselves, it follows that they come forth and subsist from 
a world above nature, which is called the spiritual world; and as in order that they may subsist or perpetually come forth there must be a continuous nexus with that world, it follows that the purer 
and more interior things which are in nature, and consequently which are in man, are from that world; and also that the purer and more interior things are such forms as can receive the influx. And as 
there is only one possible fountain of life, as in nature there is only one fountain of light and heat, it is evident that everything of life is from the Lord, who is the First of life. And because 
this is so, it follows that all and each of the things which are in the spiritual world correspond to Him, and consequently all and each of the things which are in man; for man is a little spiritual world 
in the least form. Hence also the spiritual man is an image of the Lord. </p>

<p align="center"><b>Elliott(1983-1999) 4524</b></p><p><b>4524.</b>
Now because every single thing that exists in the world and in the natural system comes into being, and is constantly coming into being - that is, is kept in being - from something prior to itself, it 
follows that it comes into being and is kept in being from a world above the natural system, which is called the spiritual world. And because there must be a continuous connection with that spiritual 
world in order that every single thing may be kept in being, or constantly come into being, it follows that the purer or more interior things present within the natural order, and consequently within 
the human being, spring from that world, and that purer or more interior things are forms such as are able to receive influx. But because there can be only one source of life, as in the natural system 
there is only one source of light and warmth, it is clear that every trace of life originates in the Lord, who is the Primary Source of life. This being so, every single thing which exists in the spiritual 
world corresponds to Him, and so therefore does every single thing within man, for man is a tiny spiritual world in miniature form. Consequently the spiritual man is also an image of the Lord. </p>

</p><b>4524.</b>
Nunc quia omnia et singula quae in mundo et ejus natura sunt, existunt et perpetuo existunt, hoc est, subsistunt, se prioribus, sequitur quod existant et subsistant a mundo qui est supra naturam, 
qui mundus spiritualis vocatur, cum quo quia continuus nexus erit ut subsistant seu perpetuo existant, sequitur quod puriora seu interiora quae in natura, consequenter quae in homine, sint exinde; 
tum quod puriora seu interiora tales formae sint quae recipere possunt {1} influxum: et quia non dari potest nisi quam unicus fons vitae, sicut in natura non nisi quam unicus fons lucis et caloris, 
constat quod omne vitae sit a Domino, Qui est Primum vitae; et quia ita, quod omnia et singula quae in mundo spirituali sunt, Ipsi correspondeant, proinde omnia {2} et singula quae in homine, hic 
enim est in minima effigie parvulus mundus spiritualis; inde etiam spiritualis homo est imago Domini.      @1 possint$      @2 i etiam$ </p>
