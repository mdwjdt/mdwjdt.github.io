<h3 align="center" class="ired">属天的奥秘 第5201节</h3>
<h4 align="center"></h4><p><strong>5201.</strong>“在莎草中吃草”表教导。这从“吃草”和“莎草”的含义清楚可知：“吃草”或“放牧”是指接受教导，如下文所述；“莎草”，或长在河流附近的长草是指属世人的记忆知识。“草”或“植物”表示这类记忆知识，这从圣言清楚看出来。因此，“在莎草中吃草”表示在记忆知识中并通过这知识接受教导，以学习真理与良善。因为记忆知识是手段，就像内层事物能在其中显示自己的一面镜子；而这个形像则像信之真理与良善，因而属于天堂、被称为属灵的事物能在其中显示并表现自己的另一面镜子。不过，这个形像因更内在，故除了那些拥有植根于仁的信之人外，谁也看不见。这就是“在莎草中吃草”真正意义上所表示的。<br />“吃草”表示接受教导，这一点从圣言中读到这个词的地方明显看出来，如以赛亚书：<br />自此，你们撒种在地上，主必降雨在其上，并使地所出的粮肥美丰盛。到那日，你的牲畜必在宽阔的草场吃草。（以赛亚书<a href="http://39-27.cn/赛30.23.htm">30:23</a>）<br />“牲畜”表示那些处于良善与真理的人；“在宽阔的草场吃草”表示接受丰富的教导。<br />同一先知书：<br />我使你作人民的约，复兴那地，使人承受荒凉的产业，对那被捆绑的人说，出来吧！对那在黑暗的人说，显露吧！他们在路上必得饮食，他们的牧场必在一切山坡上。（以赛亚书<a href="http://39-27.cn/赛49.8.htm">49:8</a>-<a href="http://39-27.cn/赛49.9.htm">9</a>）<br />这论及主的到来；“在路上必得饮食”表示在真理上接受教导，“路”是指真理（参看<a href="627.htm">627</a>，<a href="2333.htm">2333</a>节）。“牧场”表示教导本身。耶利米书：<br />那些残害、赶散我草场羊群的牧人有祸了！耶和华以色列的神论到那些牧养祂百姓的牧人如此说。（耶利米书<a href="http://39-27.cn/耶23.1.htm">23:1</a>-<a href="http://39-27.cn/耶23.2.htm">2</a>）<br />“牧人”表示那些给予教导的人，“羊群”表示那些接受教导的人（<a href="343.htm">343</a>，<a href="3795.htm">3795</a>节）；因此，“牧养”表示给予教导。<br />由于人们习惯称教师为“牧师”或“牧人”，称那些学习的人为“羊群”，所以当谈及基于出于圣言的教义的讲道或教导时，人们也习惯说“牧养”。但当以这种方式提到这个词时，它只是一种对比，而不像在圣言中那样含有某种灵义在里面。当用在圣言中时，“牧养”之所以具有灵义，是因为当在天堂谈论基于圣言的教导或教义时，这种讨论在灵人界以可见方式来代表；在那里，属灵事物就显现在属世的形像里面。这种代表由青草、植物和鲜花而茂盛，其中还有羊群的草场构成；这种场景照着天堂里所进行的关于教导和教义的讨论的性质而发生种种变化。<br />同一先知书：<br />我必再领以色列回他的故土，他必在迦密和巴珊吃草，又在以法莲山上和基列境内得以饱足。（耶利米书<a href="http://39-27.cn/耶50.19.htm">50:19</a>）<br />“在迦密和巴珊吃草”表示在信与仁之良善上接受教导。<br />锡安女子所有的威荣都离开了她，她的首领像找不着草场的鹿。（耶利米哀歌<a href="http://39-27.cn/哀1.6.htm">1:6</a>）<br />以西结书：<br />我必在美好的草场牧养它们，它们的圈必在以色列高处的山上，它们必在佳美之圈中躺卧，也在以色列山肥美的草场吃草。（以西结书<a href="http://39-27.cn/结34.14.htm">34:14</a>）<br />何西阿书：<br />现在耶和华要牧养他们，如同牧养羊羔在宽阔之地。（何西阿书<a href="http://39-27.cn/何4.16.htm">4:16</a>）<br />“牧养他们在宽阔之地”表示在真理上给予教导。“宽阔之地”表示真理（参看<a href="1613.htm">1613</a>，<a href="3433.htm">3433</a>，<a href="3434.htm">3434</a>，<a href="4482.htm">4482</a>节）。弥迦书：<br />伯利恒、以法他啊，将来必有一位从你那里出来，在以色列中为我作掌权的。祂必站立起来，倚靠耶和华的大能牧养。（弥迦书<a href="http://39-27.cn/弥5.2.htm">5:2</a>，<a href="http://39-27.cn/弥5.4.htm">4</a>）<br /><br />用你的杖牧放你的民，就是你独居的产业的羊群。求你容他们在巴珊和基列吃草，像在往古之日一样。（弥迦书<a href="http://39-27.cn/弥7.14.htm">7:14</a>）<br />西番雅书：<br />以色列所剩下的人们必得吃草、必得躺卧，无人惊吓。（西番雅书<a href="http://39-27.cn/番3.13.htm">3:13</a>）<br />诗篇：<br />耶和华是我的牧者，祂使我躺卧在青草地上，领我在可安歇的水边。（诗篇<a href="http://39-27.cn/诗23.1.htm">23:1</a>-<a href="http://39-27.cn/诗23.2.htm">2</a>）<br /><br />我们是祂造的；我们是祂的民，也是祂草场的羊群。（或译）我们是属祂的，是祂的民，也是祂草场的羊群。（诗篇<a href="http://39-27.cn/诗100.3.htm">100:3</a>）<br />启示录：<br />宝座中间的羔羊必牧养他们，领他们到生命水的泉源。（启示录<a href="http://39-27.cn/启7.17.htm">7:17</a>）<br />约翰福音：<br />我就是门，凡从我进来的，必然得救，可以进，可以出，可以找到草场。（约翰福音<a href="http://39-27.cn/约10.9.htm">10:9</a>）<br /><br />耶稣对彼得说，你喂养我的小羊；第二次说，你牧养我的羊；第三次说，你喂养我的羊。（约翰福音<a href="http://39-27.cn/约21.15.htm">21:15</a>-<a href="http://39-27.cn/约21.17.htm">17</a>）</p>

And they fed in the sedge. That this signifies instruction, is evident from the signification of "feeding" (that is, "pasturing") as being to be instructed (of which hereafter); and from the signification 
of "sedge," or the larger grass that grows near rivers, as being the memory-knowledges of the natural man. That "grass" or "herbage" denotes these knowledges is clear from the Word. To "feed in 
the sedge" therefore, is to be instructed in memory-knowledges, and by means of these knowledges to learn about truths and good; for memory-knowledges are means, and as it were mirrors, in which an image 
of interior things shows itself; and in this image, as again in a mirror, are reflected and represented the truths and goods of faith, and consequently the things which are of heaven and are called 
spiritual; but this image, being more interior, does not appear to any but those who are in faith from charity. This is what is signified in the genuine sense by "feeding in the sedge." [2] That "to 
feed" denotes to be instructed is plain from those places in the Word where we read of it, as in Isaiah: </p>
<p>	Then shall He give the rain of thy seed, wherewith thou sowest the land, and bread of the increase 
of the land, and it shall be fat and rich; in that day shall thy cattle feed in a broad meadow (Isa. 30:23); </p>
<p>where "cattle" denote those who are in good and truth; "feeding in a broad meadow" 
denotes being abundantly instructed. [3] In the same: </p>
<p>	I have given Thee for a covenant of the people, to restore the land, to distribute the wasted heritages, to say to the bound, Go forth; to them 
that are in darkness, Be ye revealed. They shall feed upon the ways, and on all hillsides shall be their pasture (Isa. 49:8-9); </p>
<p>this is said of the coming of the Lord, "feeding upon the ways" denotes 
being instructed in truths (that "ways" are truths see above, n. 627, 2333); "pasture" denotes the instruction itself. In Jeremiah: </p>
<p>	Woe unto the shepherds that destroy and scatter the flock of My 
pasture! Therefore hath said Jehovah the God of Israel against the shepherds that feed My people (Jer. 23:1-2); </p>
<p>"shepherds" denote those who instruct, and the "flock" those who are instructed (n. 343, 
3795); thus "feeding" denotes instructing.  [4] As it has become customary to call teachers "pastors," and learners a "flock," it has also become common to speak of "feeding" when speaking of preaching, 
or of instruction from doctrine from the Word; but this is done by way of comparison, and not from the signification, as in the Word. The reason why "feeding" is spoken of in the Word from its 
signification, is that when instruction or doctrine from the Word is spoken of in heaven, then in the world of spirits, where spiritual things appear naturally, there are represented to the sight meadows 
green with grass, herbage, and flowers, with flocks therein; and this with all variety, according to what is being said in heaven about instruction and doctrine. [5] In the same: </p>
<p>	I will bring back 
Israel to his habitation, that he may feed on Carmel and Bashan; and his soul shall be sated upon the mountain of Ephraim and in Gilead (Jer. 50:19); </p>
<p>"to feed on Carmel and Bashan" denotes to be 
instructed in the goods of faith and of charity. Again: </p>
<p>	From the daughter of Zion all her honor is gone forth, her princes are become like harts, they have not found pasture (Lam. 1:6). In Ezekiel: </p>
<p>	I 
will feed them in a good pasture, and on the mountains of the height of Israel shall their fold be, and they shall lie down in a good fold, and on fat pasture shall they feed upon the mountains of 
Israel (Ezek. 34:14). [6] In Hosea: </p>
<p>	Now will Jehovah feed them as a sheep in the breadth (Hos. 4:16); </p>
<p>"to feed them in the breadth" denotes to instruct in truths. (That "breadth" is truth may be 
seen above, n. 1613, 3433, 3434, 4482.) In Micah: </p>
<p>	Thou Bethlehem Ephratah, out of thee shall He come forth unto Me who shall be ruler in Israel. He shall stand and shall feed in the strength of Jehovah 
(Micah 5:2, 4). Again: </p>
<p>	Feed Thy people with Thy rod, the flock of Thy heritage dwelling alone, let them feed in Bashan and Gilead, as in the days of an age (Micah 7:14). In Zephaniah: </p>
<p>	The remains 
of Israel shall feed and be at rest, none making afraid (Zeph. 3:13). [7] In David: </p>
<p>	Jehovah is my shepherd, in pastures of herb He will make me lie down, to the waters of rest He will lead me 
(Ps. 23:1-2). Again: </p>
<p>	It is He that hath made us, and not we, His people, and the flock of His pastures; (or according to another reading) therefore we are His, His people, and the flock of His pasture 
(Ps. 100:3). In Revelation: </p>
<p>	The Lamb that is in the midst of the throne shall feed them, and shall lead them unto living fountains of waters (Rev. 7:17). In John: </p>
<p>	I am the door; by Me if anyone 
enter in he shall be saved, and shall go in and out, and shall find pasture (John 10:9). Again: </p>
<p>	Jesus said to Peter, Feed My lambs; and a second time, Feed My sheep; and a third time, Feed My 
sheep (John 21:15-17). </p>

'And they fed in the sedge' means instruction. This is clear from the meaning of 'feeding' as receiving instruction, dealt with below, and from the meaning of 'the sedge', or longer grass that grows 
near rivers, as facts known to the natural man. Since such factual knowledge is meant by 'grass or 'plant', as is plain from the Word, 'feeding in the sedge' therefore means receiving instruction in factual 
knowledge, and through this knowledge instruction regarding things that are true and good. For factual knowledge serves as a means. Indeed it is like a mirror in which an image of interior things 
reveals itself; and this image is like another mirror in which forms of the truth and the good of faith, and therefore things which belong to heaven and are called spiritual, reveal and represent themselves. 
But being an interior one, this image is seen by none but those who have faith that is rooted in charity. This is what is meant in the genuine sense by 'feeding in the sedge'. </p>
<p></p>
<p><b>[2]</b>
 The meaning 
of 'feeding' as receiving instruction is evident from those places in the Word where one reads the expression, such as in Isaiah, </p>
<blockquote>
Then He will give rain for your seed with which you sow the land, 
and bread of the produce of the land; and there will be fatness and wealthiness. On that day, they will feed your cattle in a broad grassland. <a href="http://bible.gospelcom.net/cgi-bin/bible?passage=Isa%2030:23&amp;version=ESV&amp;interface=print&amp;showfn=yes&amp;showxref">Isa 30:23</a>. 
</blockquote>
<p>'Cattle' stands for those in whom goodness 
and truth are present, 'feeding in a broad grassland' for receiving abundant instruction. </p>
<p></p>
<p><b>[3]</b>
 In the same prophet, </p>
<blockquote>
I have given You as a covenant of the people - to restore the land; to share 
out the devastated inheritances; to say to the bound, Go out; to those who are in darkness, Reveal yourselves They will feed along the ways, and on all slopes will their pasture be. <a href="http://bible.gospelcom.net/cgi-bin/bible?passage=Isa%2049:8,%209&amp;version=ESV&amp;interface=print&amp;showfn=yes&amp;showxref">Isa 49:8, 9</a>. 
</blockquote>
<p>This 
refers to the Lord's Coming. 'Feeding along the ways' stands for receiving instruction in truths, 'the ways' being truths, <a href="627.htm">627</a>, <a href="2333.htm">2333</a>. 'Pasture' stands for the actual instruction. In Jeremiah, </p>
<blockquote>
Woe 
to the shepherds destroying and scattering the flock of My pasture! Therefore said Jehovah God of Israel against the shepherds feeding My people..... <a href="http://bible.gospelcom.net/cgi-bin/bible?passage=Jer%2023:1,%202&amp;version=ESV&amp;interface=print&amp;showfn=yes&amp;showxref">Jer 23:1, 2</a>. 
</blockquote>
<p>'The shepherds' stands for 
those who give instruction, and 'the flock' for those who receive it, <a href="347.htm">347</a>, <a href="3795.htm">3795</a>, so that 'feeding' means giving instruction. </p>
<p></p>
<p><b>[4]</b>
 It has become customary to refer to those who teach as 'pastors' or 
'shepherds' and to those who learn as 'the flock'. For this reason the use of the expression 'feeding' has become commonly accepted when talking about preaching or about instruction given in doctrine 
or the Word. But when the expression is used in this way it is only a comparison and not, as when it occurs in the Word, one that holds any spiritual meaning within it. The reason 'feeding', when used 
in the Word, has a spiritual meaning is that when instruction and doctrine based on the Word are being talked about in heaven, that discussion is represented in a visual way in the world of spirits, 
where spiritual realities make their appearance within natural images. That representation consists of grasslands that are lush with grass, plants, and flowers, and where also there are flocks; and every 
variation of this scene occurs, as determined by the nature of the discussion that is taking place in heaven regarding instruction and doctrine. </p>
<p></p>
<p><b>[5]</b>
 In the same prophet, </p>
<blockquote>
I will bring back Israel 
to his habitation so that he may feed on Carmel and Bashan; and on mount Ephraim and in Gilead his soul will be satisfied. <a href="http://bible.gospelcom.net/cgi-bin/bible?passage=Jer%2050:19&amp;version=ESV&amp;interface=print&amp;showfn=yes&amp;showxref">Jer 50:19</a>. 
</blockquote>
<p>'Feeding on Carmel and Bashan' stands for receiving instruction 
in forms of the good of faith and charity. In the same prophet,  </p>
<blockquote>
There has gone out from the daughter of Zion all her majesty; her princes have become like deer, they have not found pasture. 
<a href="http://bible.gospelcom.net/cgi-bin/bible?passage=Lam%201:6&amp;version=ESV&amp;interface=print&amp;showfn=yes&amp;showxref">Lam 1:6</a>. 
</blockquote>
In Ezekiel </p>
<blockquote>
I will feed them in a good pasture, and their fold will be on the mountains of the loftiness of Israel; and they will lie down in a good fold, and on fat pasture they will feed 
upon the mountains of Israel. <a href="http://bible.gospelcom.net/cgi-bin/bible?passage=Ezek%2034:14&amp;version=ESV&amp;interface=print&amp;showfn=yes&amp;showxref">Ezek 34:14</a>.

</blockquote>
<p>'Feeding in a broad place' stands for giving instruction in truths, 
for 'a broad place' means truth, see <a href="1613.htm">1613</a>, <a href="3473.htm">3473</a>, <a href="3434.htm">3434</a>, <a href="4482.htm">4482</a>. In Micah, </p>
