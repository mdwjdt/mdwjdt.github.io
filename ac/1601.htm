<p><strong>[NCE]1601.</strong> <a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_1601/bible_king-james-version_genesis_13_14" target=_top>Genesis 13:14</a>. And Jehovah said to Abram, after Lot separated from him, "Please raise your eyes and look out from the place there where you are toward the north and toward the south and toward the east and toward the west."<br />Jehovah said to Abram means this is the way Jehovah talked to the Lord. After Lot separated from him means when the cravings of his outer self had been put aside so as not to get in the way. Please raise your eyes and look out from the place there where you are symbolizes the Lord's state at that time, from which he could perceive what was to come. Toward the north and toward the south and toward the east and toward the west symbolizes absolutely everyone in the universe. </p>

Verse 14. And Jehovah said unto Abram, after that Lot was separated from him, Lift up, I pray, thine eyes, and look from the place where thou art, northward, and southward, and eastward, and westward. 
"Jehovah said unto Abram," signifies that Jehovah spoke thus to the Lord; "after that Lot was separated from him," signifies when the cupidities of the external man had been removed so as not to impede; 
"Lift up, I pray, thine eyes, and look from the place where thou art," signifies the state in which the Lord then was, from which He could perceive things that were to come; "northward, and southward, 
and eastward, and westward," signifies all men, as many as there are in the universe. </p>

<p align="center"><b>Elliott(1983-1999) 1601</b></p><p><b>1601.</b>
Verse 14 And Jehovah said to Abram after Lot had been separated from him, Lift up your eyes, now, and look from the place where you are, towards the north, and towards the south, and towards the east, 
and towards the west. </p>
<p>'Jehovah said to Abram' means that Jehovah so spoke to the Lord. 'After Lot had been separated from him' means when the desires of the External Man had been removed so that 
they did not obstruct. 'Lift up your eyes, now, and look from the place where you are' means the Lord's state at that time from which He was able to perceive things to come. 'Towards the north, and towards 
the south, and towards the east, and towards the west' means all men, as many as there are in the entire universe. </p>

<p align="center"><b>Latin(1748-1756) 1601</b>
</p><b>1601.</b>
Vers. 14.  Et Jehovah dixit ad Abram, postquam separatus Lot ab illo, Tolle quaeso oculos tuos, et vide e loco quo tu ibi, versus septentrionem, et versus meridiem, et versus orientem, et versus occidentem. 
'Jehovah dixit ad Abram' significat quod Jehovah ita locutus ad Dominum: 'postquam separatus Lot ab illo' significat cum cupiditates externi hominis remotae essent ut non impedirent: 'tolle quaeso 
oculos tuos, et vide e loco quo tu ibi' significat statum in quo tunc Dominus e quo percipere posset ventura: 'versus septentrionem, et versus meridiem, et versus orientem, et versus occidentem' 
significat omnes quotcumque sunt in universo. </p>
