<h3 align="center" class="ired">属天的奥秘 第9399节</h3>
<h4 align="center"></h4><p><strong>9399.</strong>“摩西就取了血来，将血洒在百姓身上”表使人适合接受它。这从“祭物的血”和“洒在百姓身上”的含义清楚可知：“祭物的血”是指从主发出的神性真理，如前所述（<a href="9393.htm">9393</a>节）；“洒在百姓身上”是指使人适合接受它，因为“洒”表示流入，因而表示适合。从主发出的神性真理不断流入一个人，并形成他的理解力；事实上，若你愿意相信，没有从主发出的神之真理的不断流入，人什么也看不见、什么也学不到。因为从主发出的神性真理就是那光照人类心智并构成内在视觉，也就是理解力的光。这光因不断流入，故使每个人适合接受它。然而，那些接受它的人是过着一种良善生活的人，而那些不接受它的人是过着一种邪恶生活的人。即便如此，和前者一样，后者仍拥有看见并学习神性真理的能力，而且只要他们远离邪恶的行径，还拥有接受它的能力。这就是摩西洒在百姓身上的那一半血所表示的。<br />从主发出的神性真理就是那光照人类心智，并构成其内在视觉，也就是理解力的光（参看<a href="2776.htm">2776</a>，<a href="3167.htm">3167</a>，<a href="3195.htm">3195</a>，<a href="3636.htm">3636</a>，<a href="3643.htm">3643</a>，<a href="3993.htm">3993</a>，<a href="4405.htm">4405</a>，<a href="5400.htm">5400</a>，<a href="8644.htm">8644</a>，<a href="8707.htm">8707</a>节）。在约翰福音中所表示的，也是这神性真理：<br />那光是真光，照亮一切进入世上的人。祂在世界，世界也是藉着祂造的，世界却不认识祂。（约翰福音<a href="http://39-27.cn/约1.9.htm">1:9</a>，<a href="http://39-27.cn/约1.10.htm">10</a>）<br />此处论述的主题是圣言，也就是从主发出的神性真理。<br />凡心智健全的世人都有学习神之真理的能力，因而只要他远离邪恶的行径，还有接受它的能力，正如大量经历使我知道的那样。因为在来世，所有人，无论恶人还是善人，无一例外，都能学习并明白何为真理，何为虚假，以及何为良善，何为邪恶。但恶人虽能明白何为真理和良善，却不想去明白；因为他们的意愿和那里的邪恶会对抗，觉得厌恶。因此，当独自一人时，他们就又陷入其邪恶的虚假，并憎恶他们所明白的真理和良善。这同样适用于那些在世上虽明白真理，却弃绝它们的人。我由此清楚看出，从主发出的神性真理不断流入人类心智，使它们适合接受它；事实上，人们远离爱自己爱世界的邪恶行径到何种程度，它就在何种程度上被接受。</p>

And Moses took the blood, and sprinkled it on the people. That this signifies adaptation to the reception of man, is evident from the signification of "the blood of the sacrifice," as being the Divine 
truth that proceeds from the Lord (of which above, n. 9393); and from the signification of "sprinkling on the people," as being adaptation to the reception of man; for by "sprinkling" is signified flowing 
in, thus adapting. For the Divine truth which is from the Lord is continually flowing in with man, and forms his understanding; and if you will believe it, without this continual influx of the 
truth Divine that proceeds from the Lord a man can perceive and understand nothing whatever. For the Divine truth that proceeds from the Lord is the light which lights up the mind of man, and makes the 
internal sight, which is the understanding; and as this light continually flows in, it adapts everyone to receive. But they who receive are they who are in the good of life; and they who do not receive 
are they who are in evil of life. Nevertheless the latter, like the former, have the capacity of perceiving and understanding, and also the capacity of receiving, insofar as they desist from evils. 
These things were signified by the half of the blood which Moses sprinkled on the people. [2] (That the Divine truth which proceeds from the Lord is the light which lights up the mind of man, and makes 
his internal sight, which is the understanding, see n. 2776, 3167, 3195, 3636, 3643, 3993, 4405, 5400, 8644, 8707.) This also is meant in John: </p>
<p>     That was the true light, which lighteth every 
man that cometh into the world. He was in the world, and the world was made by Him, but the world knew Him not (John 1:9, 10); </p>
<p>the subject here treated of is the Word, which is the Divine truth that 
proceeds from the Lord. [3] That every man in the world who is of sound reason has the capacity of understanding truth Divine, and consequently the capacity of receiving it, insofar as he desists from 
evils, has been given me to know by much experience. For all in the other life, without exception, both the evil and the good, can understand what is true and what is false, and also what is good and 
what is evil; but although the evil understand what is true and good, they nevertheless do not desire to understand, because their will and the evil therein make resistance. And therefore when they 
are left to themselves, they nevertheless sink back into the falsities of their evil, and hold in aversion the truth and good which they had understood. The case had been the same with such persons in 
the world, where they had rejected truths, although they could understand them. From this experience it has become evident that the Divine truth which proceeds from the Lord is continually flowing into 
human minds and adapting them to receive it, and that it is received in the proportion that the evils of the loves of self and of the world are desisted from. </p>

'And Moses took the blood, and sprinkled it over the people' means making a person well-adapted to receive it. This is clear from the meaning of 'the blood of the sacrifice' as Divine Truth emanating 
from the Lord, dealt with above in <a href="9393.htm">9393</a>; and from the meaning of 'sprinkling over the people' as making a person well-adapted to receive it, for 'sprinkling' means flowing into something, that is, adapting 
it. Divine Truth which emanates from the Lord is flowing unceasingly into a person and composing his understanding; indeed, if you are willing to believe it, without that unceasing inflow of God's 
truth emanating from the Lord he can see and learn nothing. For the Divine Truth emanating from the Lord is the light which enlightens the human mind and composes inner sight, which is the understanding. 
And since that light flows in unceasingly, it makes every person well-adapted to receive it. Those who do receive it however are people who lead a good life, whereas those who do not receive it 
are people who lead a bad life. Even so, the latter have the ability, just as the former do, to see and learn Divine Truth, and also to receive it to the extent that they depart from evil ways. This 
is what the half of the blood sprinkled over the people by Moses served to mean.  </p>

 Regarding Divine Truth emanating from the Lord, that it is the Light which enlightens the human mind and composes 
its inner sight, which is the understanding, see <a href="2776.htm">2776</a>, <a href="3167.htm">3167</a>, <a href="3195.htm">3195</a>, <a href="3636.htm">3636</a>, <a href="3643.htm">3643</a>, <a href="3993.htm">3993</a>, <a href="4405.htm">4405</a>, <a href="5400.htm">5400</a>, <a href="8644.htm">8644</a>, <a href="8707.htm">8707</a>.  This Divine Truth is also meant in John,  </p>
<blockquote>
He was the true light which enlightens every 
person coming into the world. He was in the world, and the world was made by Him, but the world did not know Him. <a href="http://bible.gospelcom.net/cgi-bin/bible?passage=John%201:9-11&amp;version=ESV&amp;interface=print&amp;showfn=yes&amp;showxref">John 1:9-11</a>.  
</blockquote>
<p>This refers to the Word, which is Divine Truth emanating from the 
Lord.  </p>
<p></p>
<p><b>[3]</b>
 Every person in the world who is sound in mind has the ability to learn God's truth, and consequently has the ability to receive it to the extent that he departs from evil ways, as considerable 
experience has enabled me to know. For all without exception in the next life, the evil as well as the good, are able to learn what is true and what is false, also what is good and what is bad. 
But the evil, though they can see what truth or good is, have no wish to see it; for their will, and the evil there, finds it repugnant. When left alone to themselves therefore the evil fall back 
to the falsities accompanying their evil, in detestation of the truth or good they have come to see. The same applied to such people when they were in the world, where they refused to accept truths which 
they were able to see. From this it has been evident to me that Divine Truth emanating from the Lord flows constantly into human minds and makes them well-adapted to receive it, and that it is indeed 
received by people to the extent that they depart from the evil ways that go with self-love and love of the world.  </p>

`Et accepit Moscheh sanguinem et sparsit super populum': quod significet adaptationem ad recipiendum ab homine, constat ex significatione `sanguinis sacrificii' quod sit Divinum Verum procedens a Domino, 
de qua supra n. 9393, et ex significatione `spargere super populum' quod sit (x)adaptatio ad recipiendum ab homine, per `spargere' enim significatur influere, ita adaptare; Divinum enim Verum quod 
a Domino, continue influit apud hominem et facit intellectuale ejus; et si credere velis, homo absque continuo influxu veri Divini procedentis a Domino prorsus nihil potest percipere et intelligere; 
Divinum {1}namque Verum procedens a Domino est lux quae illuminat mentem hominis et facit visum internum, qui est intellectus; et quia illa lux continue influit, ideo unumquemvis adaptat ad recipiendum; 
qui autem recipiunt sunt qui in bono vitae sunt, qui autem non recipiunt sunt qui in malo vitae sunt; sed usque hi sicut illi in facultate percipiendi et intelligendi sunt, et quoque in facultate 
recipiendi quantum desistunt a malis; haec significata sunt per `dimidium sanguinis quod Moscheh sparsit super populum.' 2 Quod Divinum Verum procedens a Domino sit Lux quae illuminat mentem hominis 
et facit visum ejus internum, qui est intellectus, videatur n. 2776, 3167, 3195, 3636, 3643, 3993, (x)4405, 5400, 8644, 8707; hoc quoque intelligitur apud Johannem, Erat lux vera quae illuminat omnem 
hominem venientem in mundum; in mundo erat, et mundus per Ipsum factus est, sed mundus Ipsum non cognovit, i [9,] 10, 11; </p>
<p>agitur ibi de Verbo, quod est {2}Divinum Verum procedens a Domino. 3 Quod 
unusquisque homo qui in mundo, qui sanae rationis est, in facultate intelligendi verum Divinum sit, et inde in facultate recipiendi quantum desistit a malis, per plurem experientiam mihi datum est scire; 
omnes enim quotcumque in altera vita sunt, tam mali quam boni, {3} possunt intelligere quid verum et quid falsum, tum quid bonum et quid malum, sed mali tametsi verum et bonum intelligunt, non usque 
volunt intelligere, repugnat enim voluntas, et ibi malum; quapropter cum sibi relicti sunt, usque in falsa sui mali relabuntur, et aversantur verum et bonum quae intellexerunt; similiter se habuit 
cum talibus in mundo, ubi vera, quae tamen intelligere potuerunt, a se repulerunt; inde patuit quod Divinum Verum procedens a Domino continue in mentes humanas influat et adaptet illas ad recipiendum, 
et quod tantum recipiatur quantum desistitur a malis, quae sunt amorum sui et mundi. @1 enim$ @2 Verum Divinum altered to Divinum Verum$ @3 i paene aeque$ </p>
