And Jehovah said, "Look: the people are one and they all have one language, and this is what they are starting to do; and now nothing would be prohibited to them that they thought to do."<br />Jehovah said means that it was so. Look: the people are one and they all have one language, means that religious truth and doctrine were the same for everyone. And this is what they are starting to do means that now they are starting to alter. And now nothing would be prohibited to them that they thought to do means unless their status now changes. </p>

Verse 6. And Jehovah said, Behold, the people are one, and they all have one lip, and this is what they begin to do; and now nothing will be withholden from them of all which they have thought to do. 
"And Jehovah said," signifies that it was so; "Behold, the people are one, and they all have one lip," signifies that they all had one truth of faith and doctrine; "and this is what they begin to do," 
signifies that they now begin to become different; "and now nothing will be withholden from them of all which they have thought to do," signifies unless their state is now changed. </p>

Verse 6 And Jehovah said, See, they are one people, and they all have one lip, and this they have started to do; and now they will not be held back from anything which they have thought of doing. </p>
<p>'Jehovah 
said' means that it was so. 'See, they are one people, and they all have one lip' means that all had the truth of faith and held to the same doctrine. 'And this they have started to do' means 
that they are now starting to become different. 'And now they will not be held back from anything which they have thought of doing' means unless their state is now altered. </p>

Vers. 6.  Et dixit Jehovah, En populus unus, et labium unum omnibus illis, et hoc inceptum eorum ad faciendum; et nunc non prohiberetur ab iis omne quod cogitarunt facere.  'Dixit Jehovah' significat 
quod ita esset:  'en populus unus, et labium unum omnibus illis' significat quod verum fidei et doctrina una omnibus fuerit:  'et hoc inceptum eorum ad faciendum' significat quod nunc alii fieri incipiant: 
 'et nunc non prohiberetur ab iis omne quod cogitarunt facere' significat nisi nunc status eorum mutetur. </p>
