<h3 align="center" class="ired">属天的奥秘 第1756节</h3>
<h4 align="center"></h4><p><strong>1756.</strong>上述内容是本章内义总体上所涉及的事物。但是，当根据这些话的含义分别详细解读每一个事物时，这些事物的系列或连贯性及其优美，不象以一个单一概念来理解它们时那样能显现出来。因为当以一个单一概念来理解它们全部时，那些已分散的事物就会显得条理分明，并优美地联结起来。内中情形就象有人听别人说话，并将注意力投向所说那些字词时的情形一样。在这种情况下，他对说话者所表达观念的理解，不如他不注意这些字词及其含义时那么好。圣言的内在意义与外在意义或字面意义之间的关系，非常类似于言语与几乎没听见，更没有留意所使用的实际字词之间的关系，如当心思唯独专注于说话者用这些字词所表示的事物意义时的情形。<br />上古时代的写作方式是用一些人和一些话来代表真实事物，这些人或这些话与其所表示的事物迥然不同。世俗作家以这种方式编纂他们的历史，甚至包括那些属于文明道德生活的事务；而事实上，这些事和字面上所写的完全不一样，字义之下其实另有所指。他们甚至用神明和女神来表达各种情感，后来异教徒便向这些神明和女神献上神圣敬拜。凡受过良好教育的人都知道这一点，因为这类古书仍然存在。他们的这种写作风格源于洪水前的上古之人，上古之人用诸如地上和世间可见之物来代表和表示天堂和神性之物。因此，他们在观看宇宙物体，尤其形式和秩序都很优美的物体时，内心和灵魂充满欢喜快乐。这就是为何那个时代，教会所有的书都是以这种风格写成的。约伯记就是这样一本书，所罗门的雅歌也是模仿它们。摩西在民数记（<a href="http://39-27.cn/民21.14.htm">21:14</a>，<a href="http://39-27.cn/民21.27.htm">27</a>）所提到的书也具有这种性质，此外还有很多失传的书。<br />这种风格是从古代流传下来的，故后来在外邦人和雅各的后代中备受推崇，甚至到了凡不以这种风格写成的东西，他们都不视之为圣的地步。因此，他们在被先知的灵感动时，就会以这种方式说话，这也出于很多隐藏的原因。这就是雅各（创世记<a href="http://39-27.cn/创49.3.htm">49:3</a>-<a href="http://39-27.cn/创49.17.htm">17</a>），摩西（出埃及记<a href="http://39-27.cn/出15.1.htm">15:1</a>-<a href="http://39-27.cn/出15.21.htm">21</a>；申命记<a href="http://39-27.cn/申33.2.htm">33:2</a>-<a href="http://39-27.cn/申33.29.htm">29</a>），属于东方之子、来自古教会仍存在之处的叙利亚的巴兰（民数记<a href="http://39-27.cn/民23.7.htm">23:7</a>-<a href="http://39-27.cn/民23.10.htm">10</a>，<a href="http://39-27.cn/民23.19.htm">19</a>-<a href="http://39-27.cn/民23.24.htm">24</a>；<a href="http://39-27.cn/民24.5.htm">24:5</a>-<a href="http://39-27.cn/民24.9.htm">9</a>，<a href="http://39-27.cn/民24.17.htm">17</a>-<a href="http://39-27.cn/民24.24.htm">24</a>），底波拉和巴拉（士师记<a href="http://39-27.cn/士5.2.htm">5:2</a>-<a href="http://39-27.cn/士5.31.htm">31</a>），哈拿（撒母耳记上<a href="http://39-27.cn/撒上2.2.htm">2:2</a>-<a href="http://39-27.cn/撒上2.10.htm">10</a>）等人的情形。尽管很少有人明白或知道他们所说的话表示主国度和教会的天堂之物，但他们仍被震撼，充满敬畏和惊奇，并感觉这些话里面有神性和神圣之物。<br />不过，圣言的历史也具有类似性质。也就是说，每一个名字和每一句话都代表和表示主国度的属天和属灵之物，只是学术界尚不知晓，除非圣言的每一部分，直至最细微之处被启示。天堂的奥秘就包含在圣言的一切事物中，无论总体还是细节。</p>

<p><strong>[NCE]1756.</strong> This is the message of the inner meaning, in its general outlines; but when every last word is explained according to its symbolism, the actual train of thought and its beauty cannot be seen as well as it would be if the whole were captured in a single mental image. When all of it is grasped in a single idea, then scattered particulars are seen to cohere and connect in a beautiful way.<br />The situation resembles that in which we hear someone talking and focus on the words. We do not pick up on the idea of the speaker as well as we would if we ignored the words and their definitions. Scripture's inner meaning (compared to its outer letter) is almost the same as speech whose words we only barely hear, much less pay attention to, when our mind is entirely absorbed by the ideas embodied in the speaker's words.<br />[2] The ancient method of writing used words and human figures to represent ideas in an entirely allegorical way. Secular writers of the day composed their histories in this way, and also [their works on] issues of public and private life. As a matter of fact, not a single written word was what it literally seemed to be; each represented another meaning. Ancient authors even presented the full range of passions as gods and goddesses, whom pagan peoples later began to worship as divine. Any literate person can see that this is so, since ancient books of the kind are still in existence.<br />This method of writing they inherited from the very earliest people, who lived before the Flood. The earliest people were in the habit of representing heavenly concepts and divine ones to themselves in the form of things visible in nature and in their culture. Because of this, it filled their minds and souls with pleasure and delight to observe the objects of the universe, especially those that displayed beauty of form or design. So all the books in the church of that time were written this way. Job is one such book. Solomon's Song of Songs is one that imitated them. The two books Moses mentioned in <a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_1756/bible_king-james-version_numbers_21_14" target=_top>Numbers 21:14</a>, <a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_1756/bible_king-james-version_numbers_21_27" target=_top>27</a> were of the same kind.{*1} And there were many more that did not survive.<br />[3] This writing mode was later admired for its antiquity by both Jacob's descendants and the surrounding nations — so much so that they revered nothing as divine that was not written in that mode. People inspired by the prophetic spirit spoke in a similar way: Jacob (<a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_1756/bible_king-james-version_genesis_49_3-27" target=_top>Genesis 49:3-27</a>); Moses (<a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_1756/bible_king-james-version_exodus_15_1-21" target=_top>Exodus 15:1-21</a>; <a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_1756/bible_king-james-version_deuteronomy_33_2-29" target=_top>Deuteronomy 33:2-29</a>); Balaam, a "child of the east" from Syria, where the ancient church remained in existence (<a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_1756/bible_king-james-version_numbers_23_7-10" target=_top>Numbers 23:7-10</a>, <a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_1756/bible_king-james-version_numbers_23_19-24" target=_top>19-24</a>; <a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_1756/bible_king-james-version_numbers_24_5-9" target=_top>24:5-9</a>, <a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_1756/bible_king-james-version_numbers_24_17-24" target=_top>17-24</a>); Deborah and Barak (<a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_1756/bible_king-james-version_judges_5_2" target=_top>Judges 5:2</a>-end); Hannah (<a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_1756/bible_king-james-version_1-samuel_2_2-10" target=_top>1 Samuel 2:2-10</a>); and many others. They spoke this way for many hidden reasons. People did not understand their words, and only a very small number realized that the words symbolized the heavenly affairs of the Lord's kingdom and church. Even so, touched and filled with wondering awe, they sensed that something divinely sacred was present in those words.<br />[4] The histories of the Word are like this as well; in them too the individual names and the individual words represent and symbolize the heavenly and spiritual qualities of the Lord's kingdom. This has not yet been recognized by the scholarly world, though, which knows only that the Word was inspired down to its smallest jot and that as a whole and in every word it contains secrets of heaven.{*2} <br /><strong>Footnotes:</strong><br />{*1} The names of the books mentioned in <a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_1756/bible_king-james-version_numbers_21_14" target=_top>Numbers 21:14</a>, <a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_1756/bible_king-james-version_numbers_21_27" target=_top>27</a> are 1. the Book of the Wars of Yahweh (that is, Jehovah), already referred to in <a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_1756/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_1659#subsection-2-3" target=_top>1659:3</a> and 1664:11-12 under the title Jehovah's Wars; and 2. what Swedenborg elsewhere calls The Utterances (Enuntiata in Latin; see <a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_1756/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_2686" target=_top>2686:1</a>, <a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_1756/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_2897" target=_top>2897-2898</a>; <a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_1756/swedenborg_true-christian-religion-chadwick_265" target=_top>True Christianity 265</a>). Both books are now lost. [Editors]<br />{*2} "Jot" refers to the smallest letter, which in the Hebrew alphabet is yod (י). The term comes from the name of the Greek letter iota, which in turn comes from the same source as yod. An allusion to <a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_1756/bible_king-james-version_matthew_5_18" target=_top>Matthew 5:18</a> is probably intended: "Till the heavens and the earth pass away, not a jot or a tittle will by any means pass away from the law." ("A tittle" here refers to a little upstroke that appears on many Hebrew letters.) [LHC] </p>

The foregoing are the things that are in general involved in the internal sense of this chapter; but the series or connection itself of the things, and its beauty, cannot appear when each separate thing 
is explained in detail according to the signification of the words, as they would if they were embraced in a single idea, for when they are all apprehended under a single idea the things that had 
been scattered appear beautifully coherent and connected. The case herein is like that of one who hears another speaking, and gives his attention to the words; in which case he does not so well apprehend 
the idea of the speaker as he would if he paid no attention to the words or their signification. For the internal sense of the Word holds nearly the same relation to the external or literal sense 
as speech does to its words when these are scarcely heard, still less attended to, and when the mind is kept exclusively in the sense of the things signified by the words of the speaker.  [2] The most 
ancient mode of writing represented subjects by using persons and words which were understood as meaning things that were quite different. Profane writers then composed their historicals in this way, 
even those matters which pertained to civic and moral life; and in fact so that nothing was exactly the same as it was written in the letter, but under this something else was meant; they even presented 
affections of every kind as gods and goddesses, to whom the heathen afterwards instituted Divine worship, as may be known to every man of letters, for such ancient books are still extant. They derived 
this mode of writing from the most ancient people who existed before the flood, who represented heavenly and Divine things to themselves by such as were visible on the earth and in the world, and 
so filled their minds and souls with joys and delights while beholding the objects of the universe, especially such as were beautiful in their form and order; and therefore all the books of the church 
of those times were written in this way. Such is the book of Job; and, in imitation of those books, such is Solomon's Song of Songs. Such were the two books mentioned by Moses in Num. 21:14, 27; besides 
many that have perished.  [3] At a later period this style of writing was venerated on account of its antiquity, both among the Gentiles and the posterity of Jacob, to such a degree that whatever 
was not written in this style they did not venerate as Divine, and therefore when they were moved by the prophetic Spirit, they spoke in a similar manner; and this for many hidden reasons. This was 
the case with Jacob (Gen. 49:3-17); with Moses (Exod. 15:1-21; Deut. 33:2-29); with Balaam, who was of the sons of the East, from Syria where the Ancient Church still existed (Num. 23:7-10, 19-24; 24:5-9, 
17-24); with Deborah and Barak (Judges 5:2-31); with Hannah (1 Sam. 2:2-10); and with many others. And though very few understood or knew that their words signified the heavenly things of the Lord's 
kingdom and church, still, being touched and penetrated with the awe of admiration, they felt that what was Divine and holy was in them. [4] But that the historicals of the Word are similar-that 
is, that in respect to every name and every word they are representative and significative of the celestial and the spiritual things of the Lord's kingdom-has not yet become known to the learned world, 
except in that the Word is inspired as to the smallest iota, and that there are heavenly arcana in all things of it in both general and particular. </p>

<p align="center"><b>Elliott(1983-1999) 1756</b></p><p><b>1756.</b>
All these matters presented above are those which in general are embodied in the internal sense of this chapter; but the whole train of thought, and its beauty, cannot be seen when every single thing 
is explained according to the meaning of the words, as they would be if they were comprehended in a single idea. When all are comprehended in a single idea those things which hitherto have lain scattered 
now appear beautifully joined and linked together. The situation is as with someone who listens to another speaking but pays attention solely to the words he uses. In this case he does not grasp 
the speaker's idea nearly so well as he would if he paid no attention to the words and their particular shades of meaning; for the internal sense of the Word in relation to the external or literal sense 
is very similar to speech in relation to the actual words used when these are scarcely listened to, still less paid attention to, as when the mind is intent on the sense alone of the things meant by 
the words used by the speaker. </p>
<p></p>
<p><b>[2]</b>
 The most ancient manner of writing represented real things by the use of persons and of expressions which they employed to mean things entirely different from those 
persons or expressions. Secular authors of those times compiled their historical narratives in this way, including those things which had to do with public life and private life. Indeed they compiled 
them in such a way that nothing at all was to be taken literally as written, but something other was to be understood beneath the literal narrative. They even went so far as to present affections 
of every kind as gods and goddesses, to whom the heathen subsequently offered up divine worship, as every well-educated person may know, for ancient books of that kind are still extant. This manner of 
writing they derived from the most ancient people who lived before the Flood, who used to represent heavenly and Divine things to themselves by means of visible objects on earth and in the world, and 
in so doing filled their minds and souls with joys and delights when they beheld the objects in the universe, especially those that were beautiful on account of their form and order. This is why all 
the books of the Church in those times were written in the same style. Job is one such book; and Solomon's Song of Songs is an imitation of them too. Both the books mentioned by Moses in <a href="http://bible.gospelcom.net/cgi-bin/bible?passage=Num%2021:14,%2027&amp;version=ESV&amp;interface=print&amp;showfn=yes&amp;showxref">Num 21:14, 27</a>, were of this nature, in addition to many that have perished. </p>
<p></p>
<p><b>[3]</b>
 Because it had come down from antiquity this style was later venerated both among the gentiles and among the descendants of Jacob, 
so much so that whatever was not written in this style was not venerated as Divine. This is why when they were moved by the prophetic spirit- as were Jacob, <a href="http://bible.gospelcom.net/cgi-bin/bible?passage=Gen%2049:3-27&amp;version=ESV&amp;interface=print&amp;showfn=yes&amp;showxref">Gen 49:3-27</a>; Moses, <a href="http://bible.gospelcom.net/cgi-bin/bible?passage=Exod%2015:1-21&amp;version=ESV&amp;interface=print&amp;showfn=yes&amp;showxref">Exod 15:1-21</a>; Deut. 
33:2-end; Balaam, who was one of the sons of the east in Syria, where the Ancient Church continued to exist, <a href="http://bible.gospelcom.net/cgi-bin/bible?passage=Num%2023:7-10,%2019%2024;%2024:5-9,%2017-24&amp;version=ESV&amp;interface=print&amp;showfn=yes&amp;showxref">Num 23:7-10, 19 24; 24:5-9, 17-24</a>; Deborah and Barak, <a href="http://bible.gospelcom.net/cgi-bin/bible?passage=Judg%205:2-end&amp;version=ESV&amp;interface=print&amp;showfn=yes&amp;showxref">Judg 5:2-end</a>; Hannah, <a href="http://bible.gospelcom.net/cgi-bin/bible?passage=1%20Sam%202:2-10&amp;version=ESV&amp;interface=print&amp;showfn=yes&amp;showxref">1 Sam 2:2-10</a>; 
and many others - they spoke in that same manner, and for many hidden reasons. And although, with very few exceptions, they neither understood nor knew that their utterances meant the heavenly things 
of the Lord's kingdom and Church, they were nevertheless struck and filled with awe and wonder, and sensed that those utterances carried what was Divine and Holy within them. </p>
<p></p>
<p><b>[4]</b>
 But that the historical 
narratives of the Word are of a similar nature, that is to say, that the particular names and particular expressions used represent and mean the celestial and spiritual things of the Lord's 
kingdom, the learned world has not yet come to know, except that the Word is inspired right down to the tiniest jot, and that every single detail has heavenly arcana within it. </p>

Haec sunt quae in genere illa involvunt in sensu interno, sed ipsa series rerum et ejus pulchritudo, non potest apparere cum omnia et singula secundum significationem vocum explicantur, ac si una idea 
caperentur; cum omnia una idea capiuntur, tunc apparent illa quae sparsa sunt, pulchre cohaerentia et connexa: se habet hoc, sicut qui loquentem audit et attendit ad voces; tunc ideam loquentis non

cum mens in solo sensu rerum significatarum per voces loquentis tenetur.  [2] Antiquissimus modus scribendi fuit repraesentativus rerum per personas et per voces, per quas prorsus alia intelligebant; 
profani scriptores tunc ita sua historica concinnabant, etiam res quae fuerunt vitae civilis et moralis, et quidem ita ut nihil prorsus tale esset, quod scriptum, quoad litteram, sed aliud sub 
illis intellectum, usque adeo ut affectiones quascumque sicut deos et deas sisterent, quibus ethnici postea cultum Divinum instituebant; quod cuivis literato potest notum esse, adhuc enim tales libri 
vetusti exstant: hunc modum scribendi traxerunt ab antiquissimis qui ante diluvium, qui caelestia et Divina sibi per illa quae conspicua fuerunt in terra et mundo, repraesentabant, et sic mentem et animam 
implebant jucundis et deliciosis cum spectabant universi objecta, imprimis quae pulchra ex forma et ordine; quare omnes libri Ecclesiae illorum temporum ita scripti sunt; talis est Liber Hiobi; 
ad imitationem illorum tale est Canticum canticorum Salomonis; tales fuerant bini Libri, quorum meminit Moses, Num. xxi 14 et 27, praeter plures qui perierunt. [3] Hic stilus dein ex antiquitate veneratus 
est, tam inter gentes, quam inter Jacobi posteros, usque adeo ut quicquid non ita scriptum esset, non ut Divinum venerarentur; quare quando acti spiritu prophetico, ut Jacobus Gen. xlix 3-(x)27; 
Moses Exod. xv 1-21; Deut. xxxiii 2 ad fin.; Bileamus, qui ex filiis orientis e Syria, ubi adhuc Ecclesia Antiqua, Num. xxiii 7-10, 19-24; xxiv 5-9, 17-24; Deborah et Barakus, Jud. v 2 ad fin.; Hannah, 
1 Sam. ii 2-10; et alii plures, tunc similiter locuti sunt, et hoc ob plures arcanas causas; quae tametsi non intelligebant nec sciebant nisi paucissimi, quod significarent caelestia regni et Ecclesiae 
Domini, usque admirationis stupore tacti et perfusi, Divinum et Sanctum illis inesse sentiebant. [4] Sed quod historica Verbi similia sint, nempe repraesentativa et significativa caelestium et spiritualium 
regni Domini, quoad singula nomina et quoad singulas voces, nondum orbi erudito notum fuit, modo quod Verbum quoad minimam iotam inspiratum sit, et quod arcana caelestia omnibus et singulis insint. </p>
