<h4 align="center"></h4><p><strong>347.</strong>“最后”表经过一段时日，这是显而易见的。起初，这被称为“该隐”的教义尚留有天真，看上去不似后来那样不可接受，这一点从他们称呼自己的供物为“一人，耶和华”明显可知。因此，一开始，信并不像“最后”或经过一段时日后那样，与爱分离得那么彻底，这是属真信的所有教义惯常的情形。</p>

<p><strong>[NCE]347.</strong> Anyone can see that the end of some days means the passage of time. The doctrine called Cain, in its beginning, when it still had a simple quality, did not appear to have been as displeasing as later, which can be seen from the fact that they called the child acquired "the man Jehovah." Neither was faith as completely divided from love in the beginning as it was "at the end of some days" or with the passage of time. This is what happens with all genuine religious teachings. </p>
<p align="center"><b>Potts(1905-1910) 347</b></p><p><b>347.</b>
That by the "end of days" is signified in process of time, is evident to all. At first, and while there was simplicity in it, the doctrine here called "Cain" does not appear to have been so unacceptable 
as it became afterwards, as is evident from the fact that they called their offspring a "man Jehovah." Thus at first faith was not so far separated from love as at the "end of days" or in process 
of time; as is wont to be the case with every doctrine of true faith. </p>

<p align="center"><b>Elliott(1983-1999) 347</b></p><p><b>347.</b>
That 'the end of days' is used to mean the course of time maybe clear to anyone. In its earliest form, when simplicity was still present in it, this doctrine called Cain does not seem to have been so 
unacceptable as it was later on. This is clear from the fact that they called offspring 'Gained a man, Jehovah'; so in its earliest form faith was not separated so much from love as it was 'at the end 
of days', or in the course of time, as usually happens with all doctrine that belongs to true faith.  </p>

</p><b>347.</b>
Quod per 'finem dierum' intelligatur progressus temporis, unicuivis constare potest.  Doctrina haec, quae 'Cain' vocatur, in suo primordio, cum adhuc simplicitas inerat, non ita ingrata fuisse apparet 
ac postea; quod constat ex eo quod appellaverint prolem 'acquisitum virum, Jehovam'; ita nec in primordio fides ita separata fuit ab amore ac 'in fine dierum' seu progressu temporis, sicut solet omnis 
doctrina verae fidei. </p>
