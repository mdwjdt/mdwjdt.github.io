<h3 align="center" class="ired">属天的奥秘 第3676节</h3>
<h4 align="center"></h4><p><strong>3676.</strong>“到亚兰人彼土利的儿子拉班那里”表旁系良善。这从“拉班”和“彼土利”的代表清楚可知：“拉班”是指源于共同家系的旁系良善，如前所述（<a href="3665.htm">3665</a>节）；“彼土利”是指第一类外邦人的良善（参看<a href="2865.htm">2865</a>，<a href="3665.htm">3665</a>节），拉班所代表的良善就出自这种良善，如同出自共同家系。彼土利在此之所以被冠以“亚兰人”的姓氏，是因为“亚兰”或叙利亚表示对良善与真理的认知（参看<a href="1232.htm">1232</a>，<a href="1234.htm">1234</a>，<a href="3249.htm">3249</a>节），这些认知就是此处所论述的主题。<br />“雅各”在此所代表的良善所源于的外在真理无非是认知，因为认知就是人首先所吸收的真理，还被那些刚刚开始重生的人视为真理。然而，认知本身并非真理，而是凭神性之物存在于它们里面；只有这些神性之物照耀它们时，它们才第一次变成真理。在此之前，它们不过是一般器皿，真理能通过这些器皿并在它们里面被接受，就像前面所提到的那些认知（<a href="3665.htm">3665</a>节），以及一开始所学到的一切记忆知识。</p>

<p align="center"><b>Potts(1905-1910) 3676</b></p><p><b>3676.</b>
To Laban, the son of Bethuel the Aramean. That this signifies collateral good, is evident from the representation of Laban, as being collateral good of a common stock (concerning which see also above, 
n. 3665); and from the representation of Bethuel, as being the good of the Gentiles of the first class (see n. 2865, 3665), from which as from a common stock comes the good which is represented by Laban. 
The reason why Bethuel is here surnamed the "Aramean," is that by "Aram" or "Syria" are signified the knowledges of good and truth (see n. 1232, 1234, 3249), which are here treated of. External 
truth, from which is the good here represented by Jacob, is nothing else than knowledges; for these are the truths which are learned first of all, and are also accounted as truths by those who are in 
the beginning of regeneration. Yet knowledges are not truths in themselves, but from the Divine things within them; and when these Divine things shine forth, the knowledges for the first time become truths. 
Meanwhile they are like general vessels, through which and in which truths can be received, like those spoken of above (n. 3665), and like all the memory-knowledges that are first learned. </p>

<p align="center"><b>Elliott(1983-1999) 3676</b></p><p><b>3676.</b>
'To Laban the son of Bethuel the Aramean' means a parallel good. This is clear from the representation of 'Laban' as a parallel good that springs from a common stock, also dealt with above in <a href="3665.htm">3665</a>, and 
from the representation of 'Bethuel' as good existing with those who make up a first group of gentiles, dealt with in <a href="2865.htm">2865</a>, <a href="3665.htm">3665</a>, from which good, as from a common stock, comes the good which 'Laban' 
represents. The reason Bethuel is here surnamed 'the Aramean' is that 'Aram' or Syria means cognitions of good and truth, <a href="1232.htm">1232</a>, <a href="1234.htm">1234</a>, <a href="3249.htm">3249</a>, and these cognitions are the subject here. </p>
<p></p>
<p><b>[2]</b>
 The external 
truth from which good springs, meant by 'Jacob' here, is nothing else than cognitions, for cognitions are the truths that are absorbed first by anyone. Cognitions are also what people in the earliest 
stage of regeneration possess instead of truths. Cognitions however are not in themselves truths, yet they are such by virtue of the Divine things present within them; and only when these shine 
through them are they first made truths. Till then they are no more than general vessels by means of which and within which truths can be received, as those cognitions are which have been referred to 
already at the end of <a href="3665.htm">3665</a>, and as all the facts are that one learns at first. </p>

`Ad Labanem filium Bethuelis Aramaei':  quod significet bonum collaterale, constat ex repraesentatione `Labanis' quod sit bonum communis stirpis collaterale, de qua etiam supra n. 3665; et ex repraesentatione 
`Bethuelis' quod sit bonum gentium primae classis, de qua n. 2865, 3665, ex quo sicut ex communi stirpe bonum quod per `Labanem' repraesentatur; quod Bethuel cognominetur hic `Aramaeus,' 
est quia per `Aram' seu Syriam significantur cognitiones boni et veri, n. 1232, 1234, 3249, de quibus hic agitur.  [2] Verum externum ex quo bonum, quod hic est `Jacob,' non aliud est quam cognitiones, 
nam hae sunt vera quae omnium {1}primo hauriuntur, et quoque pro veris {2}habentur ab illis qui in initio regenerationis sunt:  sed cognitiones non sunt vera in se, sed ex Divinis quae in illis sunt, 
quae cum {3}elucent, tunc primum fiunt vera; sunt interea modo sicut vasa communia, per quae et in quibus vera recipi possunt, sicut sint illa de quibus prius n. 3665 f.; et sicut sunt omnia scientifica 
quae primum discuntur. @1 primum$ @2 agnoscuntur$ @3 prodeunt$ </p>
