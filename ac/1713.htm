<h3 align="center" class="ired">属天的奥秘 第1713节</h3>
<h4 align="center"></h4><p><strong>1713.</strong>“他和他的奴仆”表理性人和外在人中那些顺服的事物。这从代词“他”，即亚伯兰和“奴仆”的含义清楚可知：前面说过，亚伯兰是指内层人；“奴仆”是指顺服的事物。外在人中的一切事物在得以释放和改造之前，都被称为“奴仆”。因为它们除了顺从内层人外，什么也做不了。例如：外在人中有情感，也有记忆的知识；前者来自内层人的良善，后者来自内层人的真理。当这些情感和知识变得能与内层人一致行动时，就说它们服事和顺从。因此，“奴仆”在此无非表示外在人中那些顺服的事物。</p>

<p><strong>[NCE]1713.</strong> The symbolism of he and his servants as the rational self and everything in the outer self that obeyed it can be seen from the following: He, that is, Abram, symbolizes the intermediate self, discussed above [<a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_1713/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_1702" target=_top>1702</a>, <a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_1713/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_1707" target=_top>1707</a>]. Servants symbolize things that obey.<br />Before the outer self has been freed and rescued, everything in it is called a servant, because all it does is obey the intermediate self. For example, the outer self has a supply of emotions and a supply of facts. The emotions grow out of something good in the intermediate self; the facts grow out of truth there. When the emotions and facts are forced to agree with the intermediate self, they are said to serve and obey it. So servants here mean nothing if they do not mean things in the outer self that obeyed. </p>

He and his servants. That this signifies the rational man, and the things in the external man which obeyed, is evident from the signification of "he," that is, of Abram, as being the interior man (explained 
above); and from the signification of "servants," as being the things which obey. All the things that are in the external man before it has been liberated and vindicated, are called "servants," 
for they do nothing but render obedience to the interior man. For example: in the exterior man there are affections and there are memory-knowledges; the former are from the goods of the interior man, 
and the latter are from the truths of the same. When these are made to act so that they accord with the interior man, they are said to serve and obey; and therefore by "servants" nothing else is here 
signified than those things in the external man which obeyed. </p>

<p align="center"><b>Elliott(1983-1999) 1713</b></p><p><b>1713.</b>
'He and his servants' means the Rational Man and those things in the External Man that were obedient. This is clear from the meaning of the pronoun 'he', that is, of Abram, as the Interior Man, dealt 
with above, and from the meaning of 'servants' as things that are obedient. All things in the external man, before this has been set free and reclaimed, are called 'servants' or 'slaves', for they are 
wholly obedient to the interior man. For example, present with the exterior man there are affections and there is factual knowledge. The former originate in the goods of the interior man, the latter 
in the truths of the same. When these are made to act so that they conform with the interior man they are said to 'serve and obey'. Here therefore 'servants' means nothing else than the things in the 
External Man that were obedient. </p>

</p><b>1713.</b>
'Ille et servi illius': quod significet Rationalem Hominem et quae in Externo oboediverunt, constat a significatione 'illius,' hoc est, Abrami quod sit Interior Homo, de qua supra, et a significatione 
'servorum' quod sint quae oboediunt. Omnia quae in externo homine, antequam hic liberatus est et vindicatus, dicuntur 'servi,' nam non aliter ac oboediunt interiori; ut pro exemplo, apud exteriorem 
hominem sunt affectiones et sunt scientifica; illae sunt ex bonis hominis interioris, haec sunt ex veris ejusdem; cum aguntur ut concurrant cum interiore homine, dicuntur 'servire et oboedire'; quare 
hic per 'servos' non alia significantur quam quae oboediverunt in externo homine. </p>
