<h3 align="center" class="ired">属天的奥秘 第3118节</h3>
<h4 align="center"></h4><p><strong>3118.</strong>“那人就俯身向耶和华下拜”表快乐与欢喜。这从“俯身和下拜”的含义清楚可知，“俯身和下拜”表示快乐与欢喜。俯身和下拜是表达谦卑的身体动作，或行为上的谦卑，无论是在忧伤的状态下，还是在欢喜的状态下。当事情不遂人愿时，就是忧伤的状态；而当事情如人所愿时，就是欢喜的状态，如此处的情形：利百加照着那人心里的祈求从瓶子里给他水喝，还给他的骆驼喝。“下拜”也是表达欢喜的身体动作（参看<a href="2927.htm">2927</a>，<a href="2950.htm">2950</a>节）。之所以既提及快乐，又提及欢喜，是因为在圣言中，“快乐”涉及真理，“欢喜”涉及良善。此外，快乐属于脸，欢喜属于心。或也可说，快乐属于属灵的情感，或属于真理；而欢喜属于属天的情感，或属于良善。因此，快乐在程度上低于欢喜，如同俯身在程度上低于下拜。这一点也可从以下事实明显看出来：教会中的属灵之人只在主面前俯身，呼求恩典；而教会中的属天之人则在主面前下拜，祈求怜悯（参看<a href="598.htm">598</a>，<a href="981.htm">981</a>，<a href="2423.htm">2423</a>节）。这二者在此都被提及，是因为圣言中的每一个事物里面都有真理与良善的婚姻（<a href="683.htm">683</a>，<a href="793.htm">793</a>，<a href="801.htm">801</a>，<a href="2516.htm">2516</a>，<a href="2712.htm">2712</a>节）。</p>

The man bent himself, and bowed himself down to Jehovah. That this signifies gladness and joy, is evident from the signification of "bending himself," and of "bowing himself down," as denoting to be 
glad and to rejoice. Bending and bowing down are gestures of humiliation, that is, they are humiliation in act, whether in a state of grief or in a state of joy-in a state of grief when that which is 
wished for does not come to pass, but in a state of joy when it does come to pass; as in this case, that Rebekah, according to the vow of his heart, gave him to drink out of her pitcher, and made his 
camels drink also. (That "bowing down" is a gesture of joy also, may be seen above, n. 2927, 2950.) The term "gladness" is used, and also "joy," for the reason that in the Word "gladness" is predicated 
of truth, and "joy" of good. Moreover gladness is of the countenance, but joy of the heart; or what is the same, gladness is of spiritual affection or of truth, but joy is of celestial affection or 
of good; thus gladness is in a degree less than joy, as bending is likewise less than bowing down; which is also evident from the fact that the man of the spiritual church merely bends himself before 
the Lord, and invokes grace; whereas the man of the celestial church bows himself down before the Lord and implores mercy (see n. 598, 981, 2423). Both terms are used by reason of the marriage of truth 
and good in every single thing of the Word (n. 683, 793, 801, 2516, 2712). </p>

'The man bowed, and bowed down to Jehovah' means gladness and joy. This is clear from the meaning of 'bowing' and of 'bowing down' as being glad and joyful. Bowing and bowing down are movements of the 
body that express humility, or humility in act, either in a state of grief or in a state of joy - in a state of grief when things do not turn out as one wishes, in a state of joy when they do turn out 
well, as here when Rebekah, according to the prayer already in the man's heart, gave him a drink from her pitcher, and also gave a drink to the camels. For bowing down can be a movement of the body 
expressing joy as well, see <a href="2927.htm">2927</a>, <a href="2950.htm">2950</a>. The reason why gladness is mentioned as well as joy is that 'gladness' in the Word has reference to truth, but 'joy' to good. Furthermore gladness belongs to the 
face whereas joy belongs to the heart; or what amounts to the same, gladness belongs to spiritual affection, or to truth, joy to celestial affection, or to good. Thus gladness occurs in a less degree 
than joy, as also does 'bowing' than 'bowing down'. This is also evident from the fact that the spiritual member of the Church merely bows before the Lord and calls upon grace, whereas the celestial 
member of the Church bows down before the Lord and pleads for mercy, <a href="598.htm">598</a>, <a href="981.htm">981</a>, <a href="2423.htm">2423</a>. Both are mentioned here on account of the marriage of truth and good existing in every individual part of the Word, <a href="683.htm">683</a>, <a href="793.htm">793</a>, <a href="801.htm">801</a>, <a href="2516.htm">2516</a>, <a href="2712.htm">2712</a>. </p>

`Inflexit se vir et incurvavit se Jehovae': quod significet laetitiam et gaudium, constat a significatione `inflectere se et incurvare se' quod sit laetari et gaudere; inflexio et incurvatio sunt gestus 
humiliationis, seu humiliatio in actu, tam in statu doloris quam in statu gaudii; in statu doloris, quando non evenit quod optatur, in statu gaudii quando evenit, ut hic quod Rebecca secundum votum 
cordis ejus, dedit ei ex cado suo bibere, et quoque potavit camelos; quod incurvatio sit gestus quoque gaudii, videatur n. 2927, 2950 laetitia dicitur et gaudium, ex causa quia `laetitia' in Verbo 
praedicatur de vero, `gaudium' autem de bono; est quoque laetitia faciei, sed gaudium {1}cordis, seu quod idem, est laetitia affectionis spiritualis {2}seu veri, gaudium autem affectionis caelestis seu 
boni, ita laetitia in minore gradu {3}est quam gaudium, sicut quoque inflexio quam incurvatio; quod quoque patet ex eo quod homo spiritualis Ecclesiae coram Domino se modo inflectat, et gratiam invocet, 
at homo caelestis Ecclesiae coram Domino se incurvet et misericordiam imploret, n. 598, 981, 2423; utrumque hic dicitur, ob conjugium veri et boni in singulis Verbi, n. 683, 793, 801, 2516, 2712. @1
