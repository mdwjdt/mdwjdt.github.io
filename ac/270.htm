<h4 align="center"></h4><p><strong>270.</strong>对于“劳苦得吃”象征痛苦的生活，这从上下文的描述可知。就内义而言，“吃”即是生活。再者，痛苦的生活发生于恶灵开始争斗，同在的天使变得劳力之时。当恶灵占尽优势以后，情况就变得更糟。届时，它们控制着人的外在，天使只掌管内在，内在只有极少的存留，以致没有什么可用来保守此人，痛苦和焦虑便产生了。<br />死人很少感受到痛苦和焦虑，因为他们不再是人，虽然他们自认比别人更具人性。他们不比动物更了解何为灵性、天性、永生，像动物一样只俯视地上的事，只关注外在世界的事，只认同自我，纵情声色，且心安理得。既是死人，就无法承受属灵的冲突和试探，否则他必要崩溃，给自己带来更多咒诅，沉沦更深。因此，他们被免除了属灵的冲突和试探，直到进入灵界，在不再有死于试探和痛苦的危险时，他们将经受艰难困苦，亦即此处“土受咒诅，你必终身劳苦才能从土里得吃的”所表示的。</p>

<p><strong>[NCE]270.</strong> The symbolism of eating from the ground in great pain as life in an unhappy condition stands out clearly from the verses that come before and after. In addition, the deeper sense of eating is living. Furthermore, an unhappy life is the kind that follows when evil spirits start to attack and the angels with us begin to struggle. Life becomes even more unhappy later when the evil spirits start to take command. Those spirits then control our outer self and angels control our inner self, of which so little is left that the angels can hardly cull anything from it to defend us with. The consequence is misery and distress.<br />People who are spiritually dead rarely feel that kind of misery and distress because they are no longer human, even though they consider themselves more human than others. They have no greater ability to recognize what spiritual and heavenly qualities are or what eternal life is than a brute animal. Like an animal they face down toward the things of earth, or they turn their attention outward to worldly affairs. They foster their own interests exclusively and indulge their tastes and their senses. To all this their rational mind wholly consents. As they are dead, they would be unable to hold up under any onslaught or trial. If trouble came on them, it would weigh them down too much to allow continued life. In this way they would bring still greater curses on themselves and rush headlong into a damnation even more profoundly hellish. For this reason they are spared until they cross over into the other life, where trials and unhappiness retain no power to kill them. Then they undergo severe troubles. This likewise is what is symbolized by the words a curse on the ground and in great pain will you eat from it. </p>

That to "eat of the ground in great sorrow" signifies a miserable state of life, is evident from what precedes and follows, not to mention that to "eat" in the internal sense, is to live. The same is 
evident also from the fact that such a state of life ensues when evil spirits begin to fight, and the attendant angels to labor. This state of life becomes more miserable when evil spirits begin to obtain 
the dominion; for they then govern the external man, and the angels only the internal man, of which so little remains that they can scarcely take anything thence with which to defend the man; hence 
arise misery and anxiety. Dead men are seldom sensible of such misery and anxiety, because they are no longer men, although they think themselves more truly so than others; for they know no more than 
the brutes of what is spiritual and celestial, and what is eternal life, and like them they look downward to earthly things, or outward to worldly ones; they favor only their Own, and indulge their 
inclinations and senses with the entire concurrence of the rational. Being dead, they sustain no spiritual combat or temptation, and were they exposed to it their life would sink under its weight, and 
they could thereby curse themselves still more, and precipitate themselves still more deeply into infernal damnation: hence they are spared this until their entrance into the other life, where, being 
no longer in danger of dying in consequence of any temptation or misery, they endure most grievous sufferings, which likewise are here signified by the ground being cursed, and eating of it in great sorrow. </p>

'Eating from the ground in great pain' means a wretched state of life. This is evident from what comes before and after this, as well as from the fact that 'eating' in the internal sense means living. 
It is evident also from the fact that this kind of life is the outcome of evil spirits starting to fight, and of angels present with the man who labour and do so increasingly as evil spirits begin to 
get the upper hand. The evil spirits in this case govern his external man, the angels his internal, of which so little is left that the angels can find scarcely anything therewith which to defend him. 
This is what gives rise to wretchedness and anguish. The reason 'dead' men rarely experience such wretchedness and anguish is that they are no longer human, though they imagine that they are more human 
than anybody else. For they no more know than an animal does what the spiritual or the celestial is, or what eternal life is. Like animals they look down towards earthly objects or out towards worldly 
ones. They favour only their proprium, and give in to their own inclinations and senses, with complete acquiescence of the rational. And being 'dead' men they would not endure any conflict or temptation. 
Were temptation to come their way, it would be too severe for their lives to bear, and so they would bring an even greater curse upon themselves and would hurl themselves into a state of condemnation 
even more profoundly hellish. Consequently they are spared this until they have passed into the next life when they are no longer able to 'die' as a result of any temptation and wretchedness. 
At that time they suffer very grievously, which is likewise meant by the statement about 'the ground being cursed and man's eating of it in great pain'.  </p>

</p><b>270.</b>
Quod 'edere in magno dolore de humo' significet statum vitae miserabilem, conspicitur ab iis quae praecedunt et sequuntur praeter quod 'edere' in sensu interno sit vivere; tum ab eo quod talis vita 
sequatur, cum mali spiritus pugnare incipiunt, et angeli qui apud eum, laborare; magis dein cum mali spiritus dominari incohant: spiritus mali tunc regunt externum ejus hominem, angeli internum, de quo 
parum superest, vix ut angeli aliquid inde possint desumere quo defendant; inde miseria et anxietas.  Quod mortui homines raro talem miseriam et anxietatem sentiant, causa est quia non amplius homines 
sunt, tametsi se putant homines esse prae aliis; nam non magis quam bruta norunt quid spirituale et caeleste et quid vita aeterna; similiter spectant deorsum ad terrestria aut extrorsum ad mundana; 
modo favent proprio et indulgent genio et sensibus, consentiente omni rationali; et quia mortui, non sustinerent aliquam pugnam aut tentationem; quae si superveniret, gravior esset quam ut vivere possent, 
et sic sibi adhuc magis maledicerent, inque damnationem adhuc profundius infernalem se praecipitarent; quare parcitur iis usque dum in alteram vitam transiverint, ubi non amplius ex aliqua tentatione 
et miseria mori possunt; tunc gravissima sustinent; quae similiter significantur per haec, quod 'maledicta humus, et in magno dolore ederet de ea.' </p>
