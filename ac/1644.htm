<h3 align="center" class="ired">属天的奥秘 第1644节</h3>
<h4 align="center"></h4><p><strong>1644.</strong>有很多内在种类的恶灵不象其他灵人那样说话；但他们十分熟悉产生观念的最初来源，因而比其他灵人更狡猾。这类灵人大量存在，不过，他们与天使灵完全分离，甚至无法靠近他们。这些更狡猾的恶灵同样以抽象的方式将自己的观念附着于外在物体和内在实物，但都是污秽的那种；他们在这些物体和实物里面给自己展现各种秽物，并将自己的观念融入到这类事物中。可以说，他们很愚蠢。他们的言语为我所知，也是以容器中的秽物来代表的；其言语中涉及理解力的元素以马的后肢来代表，而马的前部没有出现。因为在精灵界，属理解力之物用马来代表。然而，天使灵的言语通过童女来代表，该童女身穿胸前有结的洁白长袍，举止优雅得体。</p><br />

<p><strong>[NCE]1644.</strong> There are many evil spirits who are not wholly superficial. They too do not talk the way [good] spirits do but likewise focus on the fundamental assumption behind an idea, so they are more subtle than [good] spirits. Their numbers are large. They are completely separate from angelic spirits, whom they cannot even begin to approach. These evil, subtler spirits also link their own ideas in an abstract way to objects [of the senses] and to subjects [of discussion], but only to impure ones. Within those objects and subjects, they create for themselves a variety of images, uniformly foul, in which they wrap their ideas. They resemble idiots.<br />Their manner of speech was described to me, and also represented as a heap of filthy garbage overflowing its container. The intellectual element of it was presented as the backside of a horse whose forequarters could not be seen. (In the world of spirits a horse represents the intellect.)<br />The speech of angelic spirits, in contrast, was represented by a virgin tastefully clothed, charmingly dressed, wearing a beautiful whitish garment neatly gathered to a kind of bodice. </p>

There are very many evil spirits of an interior kind, who do not speak as spirits do, but are also in the beginnings of ideas, and are thus more subtle than other spirits. There are many such spirits; 
but they are completely separated from the angelic spirits, and cannot even approach them. These more subtle evil spirits likewise attach their ideas to objects and things in an abstract way, but to 
such as are filthy; and in them they represent to themselves various things of a filthy nature; and they involve their ideas in such things. They are as it were silly. Their speech was made known to 
me, and was also represented by the unclean dregs from a vessel; and the intellectual element of their speech was represented by the hinder parts of a horse, whose forward parts did not appear; for in 
the world of spirits the intellectual is represented by horses. But the speech of angelic spirits was represented by a maiden of graceful carriage, becomingly attired in a robe of white, that was neatly 
fitted to a kind of vest. </p>

<p align="center"><b>Elliott(1983-1999) 1644</b></p><p><b>1644.</b>
There are very many evil spirits of an interior kind who do not speak as other spirits do; but they are well acquainted with the first origins from which ideas derive, and so are more subtle than other 
spirits. Great numbers of such spirits exist, but these have been entirely segregated from angelic spirits and cannot even go near them. These evil spirits who are more subtle also attach their own 
ideas to outward objects and inner realities in an abstract way, to those however that are filthy; and within those objects and realities they represent to themselves various but filthy things and enfold 
their own ideas within such things. They are so to speak fools. Their speech has been made known to me and has also been represented as the filthy dregs from a vessel. And that element of their speech 
which involved the understanding was represented by the hind-quarters of a horse whose fore-parts did not appear, for what belongs to the understanding is represented in the world of spirits by 
means of horses. The speech of angelic spirits however was represented by means of a virgin who was dressed beautifully in a robe of white neatly gathered at the breast, and who was graceful in the movements 
of her body. </p>

</p><b>1644.</b>
Sunt spiritus mali interiores permulti, qui nec loquuntur sicut spiritus sed sunt quoque in principiis idearum, ita subtiliores spiritibus; multa copia talium spirituum datur; sed separati prorsus sunt 
a spiritibus angelicis, ne quidem approximare ad eos possunt; illi spiritus mali subtiliores alligant quoque ideas suas objectis et rebus abstracte, sed spurcis, et inibi repraesentant sibi diversa, 
sed spurca, suasque ideas talibus involvunt; sum quasi fatui: loquela eorum mihi nota facta, tum etiam repraesentata per quisquilias immundas ex vase; et intellectuale eorum loquelae repraesentatur 
est per equi posteriora cujus anteriora non apparebant; nam intellectuale repraesentatur in mundo spirituum per 'equos.'  At loquela spirituum angelicorum repraesentata est per 'virginem' albescente 
veste concinne ad pectorale quoddam appropriata, decore indutam, habitu corporis decente. </p>
