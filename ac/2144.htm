<h3 align="center" class="ired">属天的奥秘 第2144节</h3>
<h4 align="center"></h4><p><strong>2144.</strong>“在幔利橡树那里”表直觉的品质。这从“橡树”和“幔利”清楚可知：至于“橡树”一般代表和表示什么，这在第一卷有所说明（<a href="1442.htm">1442</a>，<a href="1443.htm">1443</a>节）；“幔利橡树”所具体代表和表示之物，即直觉，则属于诸如来自记忆知识和源于那知识的第一理性的那种人性。<br />如今，人们完全不知道何为直觉，因为现在没有人拥有诸如古人，特别是上古之人所拥有的那种直觉。有一种流注从主经由天堂流入他们的理性，故当思想神圣事物时，他们立刻发觉它是不是这样。后来，当人开始不再心怀天堂观念，而唯独心怀世俗和肉体观念时，他所具有的这种直觉就消失了。取代这种直觉的，是良知，良知也是一种直觉。因为违背或照着良知行事无非是通过良知洞察事情是不是这样，或是否应这样做。<br />但伴随良知的直觉并非源于所流入的良善，而是源于真理。这真理自童年早期就已照着人们敬拜的神圣被植入在心智的理性部分，并且之后得以巩固，因为他们唯独视这真理为良善。所以，良知是一种直觉，但它起源于这类真理。当主将仁爱与纯真注入到这真理时，这良知的良善就生成了。这几点考虑表明何为直觉。然而，直觉与良知有很大的差别（关于直觉的论述，参看第一卷<a href="104.htm">104</a>，<a href="125.htm">125</a>，<a href="371.htm">371</a>，<a href="483.htm">483</a>，<a href="495.htm">495</a>，<a href="503.htm">503</a>，<a href="521.htm">521</a>，<a href="536.htm">536</a>，<a href="597.htm">597</a>，<a href="607.htm">607</a>，<a href="784.htm">784</a>，<a href="865.htm">865</a>，<a href="895.htm">895</a>，<a href="1121.htm">1121</a>，<a href="1616.htm">1616</a>节；关于灵人和天使所拥有的直觉，参看<a href="202.htm">202</a>-<a href="203.htm">203</a>，<a href="1008.htm">1008</a>，<a href="1383.htm">1383</a>-<a href="1384.htm">1384</a>，<a href="1390.htm">1390</a>-<a href="1392.htm">1392</a>，<a href="1394.htm">1394</a>，<a href="1397.htm">1397</a>，<a href="1504.htm">1504</a>节；学者不知道何为直觉，参看<a href="1387.htm">1387</a>节）。<br />至于主，当祂活在世上时，其一切思维都源于神性直觉，因为唯独祂是神性和属天之人。祂一直是独一无二的那一位，耶和华自己就在其中，其直觉也出于那一位（对此，可参看第一卷<a href="1616.htm">1616</a>，<a href="1791.htm">1791</a>节）。随着祂越来越接近与耶和华合一，其直觉越来越内在。这时，其直觉的性质从第一卷有关幔利橡树的论述（<a href="1616.htm">1616</a>节）清楚可知；下文则描述了当祂发觉本章所包含的事物时，它的性质又是如何。</p>

In the oak-groves of Mamre. That this signifies the quality of the perception, is evident from the representation and signification of "oak-groves," and also from the representation and signification 
of "Mamre." What "oak-groves" represented and signified in general was shown in volume 1 (n. 1442-1443); and what "the oak-groves of Mamre" represented and signified specifically (n. 1616), namely, perceptions, 
but such as are human from memory-knowledges [scientific], and from the first rational things thence derived.  [2] What perception is, is at this day utterly unknown, because at this day 
no one has perception like that of the ancients, especially like that of the most ancients; for these latter knew from perception whether a thing was good, and consequently whether it was true. There 
was an influx into their rational from the Lord through heaven, whereby, when they thought about any holy thing, they instantly perceived whether it was so, or was not so. Such perception afterwards perished 
with man, when he began to be no longer in heavenly ideas, but solely in worldly and corporeal ones; and in place of it there succeeded conscience, which also is a kind of perception; for to act 
contrary to conscience and according to conscience is nothing else than to perceive from it whether a thing is so or is not so, or whether it is to be done.  [3] But the perception of conscience is 
not from good that flows in, but it is from the truth that from infancy has been implanted in the rational of men in accordance with the holy of their worship, and which has afterwards been confirmed, 
for this alone do they in such case believe to be good. Hence it is that conscience is a kind of perception, but from such truth; and when charity and innocence are insinuated into this truth by the 
Lord, there comes into existence the good of this conscience. From these few observations we can see what perception is. But between perception and conscience there is much difference. (See what is 
said about perception in volume 1, n. 104, 125, 371, 483, 495, 503, 521, 536, 597, 607, 784, 865, 895, 1121, 1616; about the perception of spirits and angels, n. 202-203, 1008, 1383-1384, 1390-1392, 1394, 
1397, 1504; and that the learned do not know what perception is, n. 1387.)  [4] As regards the Lord when He lived in the world, all His thought was from Divine perception, because He alone was a 
Divine and Celestial Man; for He was the only one in whom was Jehovah Himself, from whom was His perception (as to which see also in volume 1, n. 1616, 1791). His perceptions were more and more interior 
in proportion as He approached more nearly to union with Jehovah. Of what quality His perception was at the time here treated of, may be seen from what has been said about the oak-groves of Mamre 
in volume 1 (n. 1616); and of what quality it became when He perceived the things that are contained in this chapter, is described in what now follows. </p>

'In the oak-groves of Mamre' means the character of the perception. This is clear from the representation and meaning of 'oak-groves', and also from the representation and meaning of 'Mamre'. What oak-groves 
in general represented and meant has been shown in Volume One, in <a href="1442.htm">1442</a>, <a href="1443.htm">1443</a>, and what the oak-grove of Mamre specifically represented and meant, in <a href="1616.htm">1616</a>, namely perceptions, though of a human 
kind such as spring from factual knowledge and from the initial rational concepts derived from that knowledge. </p>
<p></p>
<p><b>[2]</b>
 What perception is, is totally unknown at the present day, for nobody today possesses 
the kind of perception that the ancient and especially the most ancient people possessed. The latter knew from perception whether a thing was good and consequently whether it was true. There was 
an influx from the Lord by way of heaven into the rational part of their minds, and from that influx when they thought about anything holy, they perceived instantly whether a thing was so or was not 
so. Later on such perception with mankind perished and people began to entertain heavenly ideas no more but only worldly and bodily ones; and when this happened the place of such perception was taken 
by conscience (which also is a kind of perception), for acting contrary to conscience and according to conscience is nothing else than discerning from conscience whether a thing is so or not so, or whether 
it ought to be done. </p>
<p></p>
<p><b>[3]</b>
 But perception that goes with conscience does not originate in inflowing good but in truth which from earliest childhood has been implanted in the rational part of the 
mind in accordance with the holiness of people's worship, and after that has been confirmed; for that truth alone is believed by them to be good. Consequently conscience is a kind of perception, but 
it has its origin in truth such as this; and when charity and innocence are introduced into it by the Lord, the good that goes with that conscience is then brought into being. These few considerations 
show what perception is. Yet between perception and conscience there is a wide difference. See what has been stated about perception in Volume One, in <a href="104.htm">104</a>, <a href="125.htm">125</a>, <a href="371.htm">371</a>, <a href="483.htm">483</a>, <a href="495.htm">495</a>, <a href="503.htm">503</a>, <a href="521.htm">521</a>, <a href="536.htm">536</a>, <a href="597.htm">597</a>, <a href="607.htm">607</a>, <a href="784.htm">784</a>, <a href="865.htm">865</a>, <a href="895.htm">895</a>, <a href="1121.htm">1121</a>, <a href="1616.htm">1616</a>; about the perception spirits and angels have, in <a href="202.htm">202</a>, <a href="203.htm">203</a>, <a href="1008.htm">1008</a>, <a href="1383.htm">1383</a>, <a href="1384.htm">1384</a>, <a href="1390.htm">1390</a>-<a href="1392.htm">1392</a>, <a href="1394.htm">1394</a>, <a href="1397.htm">1397</a>, <a href="1504.htm">1504</a>; and about the learned not knowing what perception is, in <a href="1387.htm">1387</a>. </p>
<p></p>
<p><b>[4]</b>
As regards the Lord when He lived in the world, all of His thought sprang from Divine perception since He alone was a Divine and Celestial Man. For He has been the only one in whom Jehovah Himself 
was present and from whom His perception came, also dealt with in Volume One, in <a href="1616.htm">1616</a>, <a href="1791.htm">1791</a>. His perceptions became more and more interior the closer He came to union with Jehovah. The nature of His 
perception at this time becomes clear from what has been stated in Volume One, in <a href="1616.htm">1616</a>, about the oak-groves of Mamre; and then the nature of it when He perceived the things contained in this chapter 
is described in what follows below. </p>

`In quercetis Mamre': quod significet qualitatem perceptionis, constat ex repraesentatione et significatione `quercetorum,' tum ex repraesentatione et significatione `Mamre': quid querceta in genere 
repraesentaverunt {1} et significaverunt,' {2} in Parte Prima n. 1442, 1443, ostensum; et quid querceta Mamre in specie, n. 1616, nempe quod perceptiones, sed quales sunt humanae ex scientificis, et 
ex primis rationalibus quae inde; [2] quid perceptio, hodie ignotissimum est quia nullus hodie in perceptione est in quali fuerunt Antiqui et imprimis Antiquissimi; hi ex perceptione noverunt num bonum 
esset et consequenter num verum; erat influxus in rationale (c)eorum a Domino per caelum, ex quo ilico cum cogitarunt de aliquo sancto, percipiebant: num ita esset vel non ita esset: periit dein talis 
perceptio apud hominem cum non amplius in caelestibus ideis sed solum in mundanis et corporeis coepit esse {3}: et loco ejus successit conscientia, quae quoque est species perceptionis, nam agere contra 
conscientiam et secundum conscientiam, non aliud est quam appercipere inde, num ita vel non ita sit aut faciendum; [3] sed conscientiae perceptio non est ex bono quo influit {4}, sed est ex vero 
quod secundum sanctum cultus eorum implantatum est rationali ab infantia, ac postea confirmatum, hoc tunc unice bonum esse credunt: inde est conscientia species perceptionis, sed ex vero tali, cui cum 
insinuatur charitas et innocentia a Domino, existit bonum (o)istius conscientiae {5}; ex his paucis constare potest quid perceptio; (m)sed inter perceptionem et conscientiam est multa differentia;(n)
