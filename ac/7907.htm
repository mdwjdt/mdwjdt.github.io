<h3 align="center" class="ired">属天的奥秘 第7907节</h3>
<h4 align="center"></h4><p><strong>7907.</strong>“因为凡吃有酵之物的，灵魂必从以色列的会众中剪除”表凡将虚假与自己的良善相联结的，都将受到诅咒。这从“吃”、“有酵之物”、“剪除”、“灵魂”和“以色列的会众”的含义清楚可知：“吃”、是指变成自己的或归与自己（参看<a href="2343.htm">2343</a>，<a href="3168.htm">3168</a>，<a href="3513.htm">3513</a>，<a href="3596.htm">3596</a>，<a href="4745.htm">4745</a>节），因而也指联结（<a href="2187.htm">2187</a>节），因为凡将某种事物变成自己的人都是将它与自己相联结；“有酵之物”是指虚假，如刚才所述（<a href="7906.htm">7906</a>节）；“剪除”是被分离并受到诅咒（<a href="7889.htm">7889</a>节）；“灵魂”是指人；“以色列的会众”是指那些属于属灵教会的人（<a href="7830.htm">7830</a>，<a href="7843.htm">7843</a>节）。由此明显可知，“凡吃有酵之物的，灵魂必从以色列的会众中剪除”表示凡将虚假与自己的良善相联结的，都将从属灵教会中被分离出去，并受到诅咒。</p>

<p align="center"><b>Potts(1905-1910) 7907</b></p><p><b>7907.</b>
For whosoever eateth that which is leavened, that soul shall be cut off from the assemblage of Israel. That this signifies that he who adjoins falsity to his good is damned, is evident from the signification 
of "to eat," as being to appropriate (see n. 2343, 3168, 3513, 3596, 4745), thus also to conjoin (n. 2187), for he who appropriates anything to himself conjoins it with himself; from the signification 
of "that which is leavened," as being falsity (of which just above, n. 7906); from the signification of "to be cut off," as being to be separated and damned (n. 7889); from the signification 
of "soul," as being man; and from the signification of "the assemblage of Israel," as being those who are of the spiritual church (n. 7830, 7843). From all this it is evident that by "whosoever eateth 
that which is leavened, that soul shall be cut off from the assemblage of Israel" is signified that he who adjoins falsity to his good will be separated from the spiritual church, and will be damned. </p>

<p align="center"><b>Elliott(1983-1999) 7907</b></p><p><b>7907.</b>
'For anyone eating anything made with yeast, that soul shall be cut off from the assembly of Israel' means that whoever links falsity to his good is damned. This is clear from the meaning of 'eating' 
as making one's own, dealt with in <a href="2343.htm">2343</a>, <a href="3168.htm">3168</a>, <a href="3513.htm">3513</a> (end), <a href="3596.htm">3596</a>, <a href="4745.htm">4745</a>, and so linking, <a href="2187.htm">2187</a>, for one who makes something his own links it to himself; from the meaning of 'that made with yeast' as falsity, 
dealt with immediately above in <a href="7906.htm">7906</a>; from the meaning of 'being cut off' as being separated and damned, dealt with in <a href="7889.htm">7889</a>; from the meaning of 'soul' as a person; and from the meaning of 'the 
assembly of Israel' as those belonging to the spiritual Church, dealt with in <a href="7870.htm">7870</a>, <a href="7843.htm">7843</a>. From these meanings it is evident that 'anyone eating anything made with yeast, that soul shall be cut off from 
the assembly of Israel' means that whoever links falsity to his good will be separated from the spiritual Church and will be damned. </p>

</p><b>7907.</b>
`Quia omnis comedens fermentatum, et exscindetur anima illa e coetu Israelis': quod significet quod qui bono suo adjungit falsum damnatus sit, constat (x)ex significatione `comedere' quod sit appropriare, 
de qua n. 2343, 3168, 3513 fin., 3596, 4745, ita quoque conjungere, n. 2187, nam qui aliquid (t)sibi appropriat, is sibi id conjungit; ex significatione `fermentati' quod sit falsum, de qua nunc 
supra n. 7906; ex significatione `exscindi' quod sit separari et damnari, de qua n. 7889; ex significatione `animae' quod sit homo; et ex significatione `coetus Israelis' quod sint qui ab Ecclesia spirituali, 
de qua n. 7830, 7843; ex his patet quod per `omnis comedens fermentatum, et exscindetur anima illa e coetu Israelis' significetur quod qui bono suo adjungit falsum separabitur ab Ecclesia spirituali 
et damnatus erit. </p>
