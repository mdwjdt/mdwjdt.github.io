<h3 align="center" class="ired">属天的奥秘 第1407节</h3>
<h4 align="center"></h4><p><strong>1407.</strong>创世记12:1. 耶和华对亚伯兰说，你要离开本地、本族、父家，往我使你看到的地去。<br />此处和下文所发生的历史事件如所记载的那样；然而，所描述的历史事件具有代表性，每一个词都具有属灵之义。“亚伯兰”在内义上表主，如前所述。“耶和华对亚伯兰说”表对万事万物的最初意识；“你要离开本地”表祂要从肉体和世俗之物中退出；“本族”表更为外在的肉体和世俗之物；“父家”表更为内在的此类事物。“往我使你看到的地去”表要呈现出来的属灵和属天之物。</p><br />

<p><strong>[NCE]1407.</strong> <a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_1407/bible_king-james-version_genesis_12_1" target=_top>Genesis 12:1</a>. And Jehovah said to Abram, "Go your way from your land and from your birth [place] and from your father's house to the land that I show you."<br />The events of this verse and later ones happened as written, but the historical facts are representative and the words are all symbolic. In an inner sense, Abram means the Lord, as noted above. Jehovah said to Abram symbolizes a first realization. Go from your land symbolizes the bodily and worldly concerns that he would withdraw from. And from your birth [place] symbolizes bodily and worldly concerns that were relatively superficial. And from your father's house symbolizes ones that were deeper. To the land that I show you symbolizes spiritual and heavenly traits that would be presented to view. </p>

Verse 1. And Jehovah said unto Abram, Get thee out of thy land, and from thy birth, and from thy father's house, to the land that I will cause thee to see. These and the things which follow occurred 
historically, as they are written; but the historicals are representative, and each word is significative. By "Abram" in the internal sense is meant the Lord, as has been said before. By "Jehovah said 
unto Abram," is signified the first mental advertence of all; "get thee out of thy land," signifies the corporeal and worldly things from which He was to recede; "and from thy birth," signifies the more 
exterior corporeal and worldly things; "and from thy father's house," signifies the more interior of such things; "to the land that I will cause thee to see," signifies the spiritual and celestial 
things that were to be presented to view. </p>

Verse 1 And Jehovah said to Abram, Go away from your land, and from the place of your nativity and from your father's house, to the land which I will cause you to see. </p>
<p>The events described here and 
in what follows took place in history as they are recorded; yet the historical events as described are representative, and every word carries a spiritual meaning. 'Abram' is used to mean in the internal 
sense the Lord, as stated already. 'Jehovah said to Abram' means a first awareness of all things. 'Go away from your land' means the bodily and worldly things from which He was to depart. 'And from 
the place of your nativity' means bodily and worldly things that were more exterior. 'And from your father's house' means such as were more interior. 'To the land which I will cause you to see' means 
the spiritual and celestial things that were to be brought to view. </p>

Vers. 1.  Et dixit Jehovah ad Abramum, Abi tibi e terra tua, et e nativitate tua, et e domo patris tui, ad terram quam videre faciam te.  Haec et sequentia se ita habent historice, sicut scripta sunt, 
sed historica sunt repraesentativa, omnia verba sunt significativa: per 'Abramum' in sensu interno intelligitur Dominus, ut prius dictum: 'dixit Jehovah ad Abramum' significat omnium primam animadvertentiam: 
'abi e terra tua' significat corporea et mundana a quibus recederet: 'et e nativitate tua' significat corporea et mundana exteriora: 'et e domo patris tui' significat talia interiora: 'ad terram 
quam videre faciam te' significat spiritualia et caelestia quae sisterentur videnda. </p>
