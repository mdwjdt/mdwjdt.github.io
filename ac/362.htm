<h3 align="center" class="ired">属天的奥秘 第362节</h3>
<h4 align="center"></h4><p><strong>362.</strong>本节描述的是被称为“该隐”的信之教义，它如何将信从爱分离，也如何将它从仁分离，因为仁是爱的产物。哪里有教会，哪里就会产生异端，因为人们会专注于信的某一具体条款，为之贴上至关重要的标签。人的思维过程有这样的性质：当他全神贯注于某件事时，会认为这件事比其它事更重要，尤其当他幻想这是他自己的发现，当我爱和对尘世之爱刺激他的自尊膨胀时，更加如此。于是，一切都看似赞同和支持这件事，甚至直到他为此赌咒发誓，哪怕它是错的。被称为“该隐”的人们就是这样使得信比爱更重要，并且由于在这样做时，他们实际上过着没有爱的生活，所以我爱和由我爱带来的幻想在他们里面抱成一团。</p>

<p><strong>[NCE]362.</strong> This verse presents a picture of the teachings concerning faith that are called Cain, which, because they divided faith from love, also divided faith from charity, the offspring of love.<br />Wherever a church exists, heresies crop up, because when we think about a single article of faith, we make it the chief one.{*1} It is a characteristic of human thought that when we turn our attention to one consideration, we make it more important than another, especially if our fantasies claim it as our own personal discovery. When love for ourselves and for worldly advantages inflates our pride, no circumstance fails to add its consent and support, until we are almost ready to swear that it is true, even if it is false.{*2} So those referred to as Cain made faith more essential than love; and since they lived without love, they were helped along in their cause by both self-love and the fantasies that accompany it.<br /><br /><strong>Footnotes:</strong><br />{*1} Swedenborg seems to be alluding to a possible etymological meaning of "heresy." The word comes from the Greek αἵρεσις (haíresis), a noun meaning "sect" that is derived from the Greek verb αἱρεῖν (haireîn), "to choose." From this etymological point of view, a "heresy" would result from choosing one aspect of traditional doctrine and overemphasizing it. See Liddell and Scott 1968, under αἵρεσις; Oxford English Dictionary, under "heresy." [RS, SS]<br />{*2} Compare Swedenborg's earlier scientific publication Dynamics of the Soul's Domain (Swedenborg [1740-1741] 1955), part 1, <a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_362/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_18" target=_top>18</a>, in which he describes his own anatomical researches: "I have observed ... that as soon as I came across something that had never been discovered before, I would begin (perhaps as a result of self-love) to grow blind to the findings and even the best delineated discussions of others [on the subject]. I would attempt to base an entire series of rational conclusions on my discovery; along the way I would lose the ability to search honestly for, and keep in mind, the universal principles that should have been brought to bear on my individual findings, and to categorize the details under those universal principles. Indeed, when I tried to extrapolate principles from my observations, I would think I was seeing many points of confirmation in other areas, but what I was seeing was not in fact true." (Translation by JSR.) [SS, LSW, JSR] </p>
<p align="center"><b>Potts(1905-1910) 362</b></p><p><b>362.</b>
The doctrine of faith called "Cain" is here described, which in consequence of separating faith from love, separated it also from charity, the offspring of love. Wherever there is any church, there arise 
heresies, because while men are intent on some particular article of faith they make that the main thing; for such is the nature of man's thought that while intent on some one thing he sets it before 
any other, especially when his imagination claims it as a discovery of his own, and when the love of self and of the world puff him up. Everything then seems to agree with and confirm it, until at 
last he will swear that it is so, even if it is false. Just in this way those called "Cain" made faith more essential than love, and as they consequently lived without love, both the love of self and 
the phantasy thence derived conspired to confirm them in it. </p>

<p align="center"><b>Elliott(1983-1999) 362</b></p><p><b>362.</b>
This verse describes the doctrine of faith which is called Cain, and how because it separated faith from love, it also separated it from charity, the offspring of love. Wherever a Church exists, heresies 
arise in it as a consequence of people basing their thinking on one particular article of faith to which they attach supreme importance. For man's thought process is such that when he focuses his 
whole attention on any one matter he makes that more important than any other, especially so when delusion claims it as a discovery of his own, and when self-love and love of the world inflate his ego. 
In that case everything seemingly agrees with it and supports it, even to the extent of his being ready to swear to it when in fact it is false. In the same way people called Cain made faith more essential 
than love; and because in so doing they were leading lives devoid of love, both self-love and delusion resulting from it banded together in them.  </p>

<p align="center"><b>Latin(1748-1756) 362</b>
</p><b>362.</b>
Describitur hic doctrina fidei, quae 'Cain' vocatur; quae quia fidem separavit ab amore, etiam separavit a charitate, quae est proles amoris: ubicumque aliqua Ecclesia, ibi existunt haereses, ex causa 
quia dum cogitant de uno articulo fidei, quod illum principalem faciant; nam talis est cogitatio hominis dum alicui rei intendit, hoc praeponit alteri, cumprimis quando phantasia vindicat id ut inventum 
proprium, et cum amor sui et mundi sufflant, tunc nihil non quasi consentit, et confirmat, usque fere ut jurent quod ita sit, cum tamen est falsum; sicut illi qui 'Cain' vocati sunt, fidem essentialem 
fecerunt prae amore; et quia sic vivebant absque amore, conspiravit tam amor sui quam phantasia inde. </p>
