<h4 align="center"></h4><p><strong>8080.</strong>“凡你儿子中头生的人，你都要赎回”表将要被归于主的，不是信之真理，而是信之良善。这从“头生的”、“儿子”和“赎回”的含义清楚可知：“头生的”是指信（参看<a href="352.htm">352</a>，<a href="2435.htm">2435</a>，<a href="6344.htm">6344</a>，<a href="7035.htm">7035</a>，<a href="8042.htm">8042</a>节）；“儿子”是指真理（<a href="489.htm">489</a>，<a href="491.htm">491</a>，<a href="533.htm">533</a>，<a href="1147.htm">1147</a>，<a href="2623.htm">2623</a>，<a href="3373.htm">3373</a>节）；“赎回”是指给予某种其它事物来代替，如前所述（<a href="8074.htm">8074</a>，<a href="8078.htm">8078</a>节）。这些信之真理不会被归于，这一点从这些话所包含的全部信息可推知，即：“凡你儿子中头生的人，你都不要归给（也就是不可献为祭），而要赎回”。“不要归给”是指不归于，如前所述（<a href="8074.htm">8074</a>，<a href="8078.htm">8078</a>节）。由此明显可知，“凡你儿子中头生的人，你都要赎回”表示将要被归于主的，不是信之真理，而是代替它们的某种其它事物。这某种其它事物就是信之良善，这一点从这一事实可以看出来：“头生的”一般表示信之真理，如前所示（<a href="8042.htm">8042</a>，<a href="8043.htm">8043</a>节）。但由于经上在此说“他儿子中头生的人”，故所表示的是信之真理；因为既有信之真理，也有信之良善。<br />信之良善，或仁就是那要代替信之真理而被归于主的某种其它事物，这一点也可从以下事实看出来：以色列人头生的不被接纳；代替他们的是利未人；这是因为“利未人”代表信之良善，或仁（<a href="3875.htm">3875</a>，<a href="4497.htm">4497</a>，<a href="4502.htm">4502</a>，<a href="4503.htm">4503</a>节）；利未支派代替一切头生的被接纳（参看民数记<a href="http://39-27.cn/民3.12.htm">3:12</a>，<a href="http://39-27.cn/民3.13.htm">13</a>，<a href="http://39-27.cn/民3.40.htm">40</a>直到末尾；<a href="http://39-27.cn/民8.16.htm">8:16</a>-<a href="http://39-27.cn/民8.18.htm">18</a>）。信之良善就是那要被归于主的某种其它事物，这一点还可从以下事实看出来：无仁之信并非信（<a href="654.htm">654</a>，<a href="724.htm">724</a>，<a href="1162.htm">1162</a>，<a href="1176.htm">1176</a>，<a href="2231.htm">2231</a>，<a href="2343.htm">2343</a>，<a href="2349.htm">2349</a>，<a href="2429.htm">2429</a>，<a href="2839.htm">2839</a>，<a href="2982.htm">2982</a>，<a href="3146.htm">3146</a>，<a href="3325.htm">3325</a>，<a href="3849.htm">3849</a>，<a href="3865.htm">3865</a>，<a href="4368.htm">4368</a>，<a href="5351.htm">5351</a>，<a href="7039.htm">7039</a>，<a href="7082.htm">7082</a>-<a href="7084.htm">7084</a>，<a href="7342.htm">7342</a>e，<a href="7950.htm">7950</a>节）；信之良善实际上占据第一位，而信之真理只是表面上占据第一位（<a href="3539.htm">3539</a>，<a href="3548.htm">3548</a>，<a href="3556.htm">3556</a>，<a href="3563.htm">3563</a>，<a href="3570.htm">3570</a>，<a href="3576.htm">3576</a>，<a href="3603.htm">3603</a>，<a href="3701.htm">3701</a>，<a href="4925.htm">4925</a>，<a href="4926.htm">4926</a>，<a href="4928.htm">4928</a>，<a href="4930.htm">4930</a>，<a href="4977.htm">4977</a>，<a href="5351.htm">5351</a>，<a href="6256.htm">6256</a>，<a href="6269.htm">6269</a>，<a href="6272.htm">6272</a>，<a href="6273.htm">6273</a>节）；因此，仁才是头生的，或长子（<a href="3325.htm">3325</a>，<a href="3494.htm">3494</a>，<a href="4925.htm">4925</a>，<a href="4926.htm">4926</a>，<a href="4928.htm">4928</a>，<a href="4930.htm">4930</a>节）。<br />就本身而言，没有信之良善的信之真理之所以不会被归于主，也就是被给予祂，或被承认是来自祂，是因为信之真理在变成信之良善之前，没有任何生命在里面；信之真理通过意愿并行出它而变成信之良善（<a href="7835.htm">7835</a>节）。因此，当它变成信之良善时，主就承认它是祂的，因为主间接通过信之良善赐下信。此外，当属灵教会成员正在重生时，他所拥有的一切信之真理也会变成信之良善。直到这时，它才首次成为主的。<br />制定关于赎回头生的人或说人之长子的律法是为了防止他们将自己的儿子献为祭，这种做法已经在外邦人中使用了，因为他们中间还保留着古教会的条例；而古教会是一个代表性教会，不过，随着时间的推移，这个教会完全被玷污了。将头生的或长子分别为圣归给神是古教会的条例之一；但他们开始将“分别为圣”理解为“献祭”。雅各的后代也倾向于这种做法；所以这条律法展现在他们面前，为他们标记出来。为防止他们这样做，利未人取代头生的而被接纳，如前所述。在灵界，这条律法照其相对应的含义而被展现或标记出来，这层含义就是，信之真理并不神圣，因而不会被分别为圣或归给主；被分别为圣或归给主的，是信之良善。后来，人们以这种方式来理解分别为圣：他们要将头生的或长子献给耶和华，将他献为祭，正如路加福音所说的：<br />按摩西律法满了洁净的日子，他们带着耶稣上耶路撒冷去，要把他献与主。正如主的律法上所记，凡打开子宫的男子必称圣归主，并献上祭品。（路加福音<a href="http://39-27.cn/路2.22.htm">2:22</a>-<a href="http://39-27.cn/路2.24.htm">24</a>）</p>

<p align="center"><b>Potts(1905-1910) 8080</b></p><p><b>8080.</b>
And every firstborn of man among thy sons shalt thou redeem. That this signifies that the truths of faith are not to be ascribed to the Lord, but the goods of faith, is evident from the signification 
of the "firstborn," as being faith (see n. 352, 2435, 6344, 7035, 8042); from the signification of "sons," as being truths (n. 489, 491, 533, 1147, 2623, 3373); and from the signification of "redeeming," 
as being to give something else in its place (as above, n. 8074, 8078). That it denotes that these are not to be ascribed, follows from the full meaning of these words: "and every firstborn of man 
among thy sons thou shalt not cause to pass over (that is, shalt not sacrifice), but shalt redeem." "Not to cause to pass over" denotes not to ascribe (as above, n. 8074, 8078.) From all this it is 
evident that by "every firstborn of man among thy sons thou shalt redeem" is signified that the truths of faith are not to be ascribed to the Lord, but something else in their place; that this is the 
good of faith can be seen from the fact that by the "firstborn" in general is signified the good of faith (as above, n. 8042, 8043); but that when it is said "the firstborn of man among his sons" it denotes 
the truth of faith; for there is the truth of faith, and there is the good of faith.  [2] That the good of faith, or charity, is this something else which is to be ascribed to the Lord instead 
of the truths of faith, can also be seen from the fact that the firstborn of the sons of Israel were not accepted; but in their place the Levites, and this for the reason that by Levi was represented 
the good of faith, or charity (3875, 4497, 4502, 4503); that the tribe of Levi was accepted in place of all the firstborn, see Num. 3:12, 13, 40 to the end; 8:16-18. That the good of faith is this something 
else which is to be ascribed to the Lord, can also be seen from the fact that faith is not faith without charity (n. 654, 724, 1162, 1176, 2231, 2343, 2349, 2429, 2839, 2982, 3146, 3325, 3849, 
3865, 4368, 5351, 7039, 7082-7084, 7342, 7950); and also from the fact that the good of faith is actually in the first place, but the truth of faith only apparently so (n. 3539, 3548, 3556, 3563, 3570, 
3576, 3603, 3701, 4925, 4926, 4928, 4930, 4977, 5351, 6256, 6269, 6272, 6273); thus that charity is the firstborn (n. 3325, 3494, 4925, 4926, 4928, 4930).  [3] That regarded in itself the truth of 
faith without its good is not to be ascribed to the Lord, that is, given to Him, or acknowledged to be from Him, is because no truth of faith has any life in it until it becomes the good of faith; and 
the truth of faith becomes the good of faith by willing it and doing it (n. 7835). When therefore it becomes the good of faith, then it is acknowledged by the Lord as being His, for the Lord gives faith 
mediately through its good. Moreover with the man of the spiritual church all the truth of faith becomes the good of faith when he is being regenerated, and then for the first time it becomes the 
Lord's.  [4] The law concerning the redemption of the firstborn of man was delivered to the end that they should not sacrifice their sons, which came into use among the nations with whom there remained 
the statutes of the Ancient Church, which was a representative church, but which in course of time were wholly adulterated. That the firstborn were to be sanctified to God was one of the statutes 
of the Ancient Church; but by "sanctifying" they began to understand sacrificing. The descendants of Jacob also inclined to do likewise; and therefore this law was unfolded before them; and to prevent 
their doing this the Levites were accepted in place of the firstborn, as has been said. In the spiritual world this law was unfolded according to its correspondent sense, which is that the truths of 
faith are not holy, thus are not to be sanctified or ascribed; but the goods of faith. Moreover sanctification was afterward understood in this manner-that they should give or present the firstborn to 
Jehovah, and offer a sacrifice for him, according to these words in Luke: </p>
<p>     When the days of their purification according to the law of Moses were fulfilled, they brought Jesus up to Jerusalem, to 
present him to the Lord. As it was written in the law of the Lord, that every male that openeth the womb shall be called holy to the Lord, and to offer a sacrifice (Luke 2:22-24). </p>

<p align="center"><b>Elliott(1983-1999) 8080</b></p><p><b>8080.</b>
'And all the firstborn of man among your sons you shall redeem, means that the truths of faith are not to be ascribed to the Lord, but forms of the good of faith. This is clear from the meaning of 'the 
firstborn' as faith, dealt with in <a href="352.htm">352</a>, <a href="2435.htm">2435</a>, <a href="6344.htm">6344</a>, <a href="7035.htm">7035</a>, <a href="8042.htm">8042</a>; from the meaning of 'sons' as truths, dealt with in <a href="489.htm">489</a>, <a href="491.htm">491</a>, <a href="533.htm">533</a>, <a href="1147.htm">1147</a>, <a href="2623.htm">2623</a>, <a href="3373.htm">3373</a>; and from the meaning of 'redeeming' as giving something 
else instead, as above in <a href="8078.htm">8078</a>, <a href="8079.htm">8079</a>. The fact that those truths of faith are not to be ascribed follows from the full message that is implied by these words, And all the firstborn of man among 
your sons you shall not make over, that is, you shall not sacrifice, but you shall redeem', 'not making over' being not ascribing, as above in <a href="8074.htm">8074</a>, <a href="8078.htm">8078</a>. From this it is evident that 'all the firstborn 
of man among your sons you shall redeem' means that the truths of faith are not to be ascribed to the Lord, but something else instead. Proof that this something else is the good of faith is provided 
by the consideration that generally 'the firstborn' means the good of faith, as above in <a href="8042.htm">8042</a>, <a href="8043.htm">8043</a>. But since it speaks here about 'the firstborn of man among his sons', the truth of faith is meant; 
for there is the truth of faith and there is the good of faith. </p>
<p></p>
<p><b>[2]</b>
 Further proof that the good of faith, which is charity, is this something else which is to be ascribed to the Lord instead of 
the truths of faith is provided by the fact that the firstborn of the children of Israel were not accepted but the Levites instead; and the reason for this was that 'Levi' represented the good of faith, 
or charity, <a href="3875.htm">3875</a>, <a href="4497.htm">4497</a>, <a href="4502.htm">4502</a>, <a href="4503.htm">4503</a>. With regard to the acceptance of the tribe of Levi instead of all the firstborn, see <a href="http://bible.gospelcom.net/cgi-bin/bible?passage=Num%203:12,%2013,%2040-end;%208:16-18&amp;version=ESV&amp;interface=print&amp;showfn=yes&amp;showxref">Num 3:12, 13, 40-end; 8:16-18</a>. Even more proof that the good of faith is 
the something else to be ascribed to the Lord is provided by the consideration that faith without charity is not faith, <a href="654.htm">654</a>, <a href="724.htm">724</a>, <a href="1162.htm">1162</a>, <a href="1176.htm">1176</a>, <a href="2231.htm">2231</a>, <a href="2343.htm">2343</a>, <a href="2349.htm">2349</a>, <a href="2429.htm">2429</a>, <a href="2839.htm">2839</a>, <a href="2982.htm">2982</a>, <a href="3146.htm">3146</a>, <a href="3325.htm">3325</a>, <a href="3849.htm">3849</a>, <a href="3865.htm">3865</a>, <a href="4368.htm">4368</a>, <a href="5351.htm">5351</a>, <a href="7039.htm">7039</a>, <a href="7082.htm">7082</a>-<a href="7084.htm">7084</a>, <a href="7342.htm">7342</a> (end), <a href="7950.htm">7950</a>, and also by the consideration that the good of faith in actual fact occupies first place, while the truth of faith merely appears to do so, <a href="3539.htm">3539</a>, <a href="3548.htm">3548</a>, 
<a href="3556.htm">3556</a>, <a href="3563.htm">3563</a>, <a href="3570.htm">3570</a>, <a href="3576.htm">3576</a>, <a href="3603.htm">3603</a>, <a href="3701.htm">3701</a>, <a href="4925.htm">4925</a>, <a href="4926.htm">4926</a>, <a href="4928.htm">4928</a>, <a href="4930.htm">4930</a>, <a href="4977.htm">4977</a>, <a href="5351.htm">5351</a>, <a href="6256.htm">6256</a>, <a href="6269.htm">6269</a>, <a href="6272.htm">6272</a>, <a href="6273.htm">6273</a>, so that charity is the firstborn, <a href="3325.htm">3325</a>, <a href="3494.htm">3494</a>, <a href="4925.htm">4925</a>, <a href="4926.htm">4926</a>, <a href="4928.htm">4928</a>, <a href="4930.htm">4930</a>. </p>
<p></p>
<p><b>[3]</b>
 The reason why the truth of 
faith regarded in itself without the good of faith is not to be ascribed to the Lord, that is, not to be given to Him or acknowledged to come from Him, is that no truth of faith has any life within 
it until it becomes the good of faith; and the truth of faith becomes the good of faith through the willing and doing of it, <a href="7835.htm">7835</a>. When therefore it becomes the good of faith it is acknowledged by the 
Lord as being His, for the Lord imparts faith indirectly through the good of faith. Every truth of faith too that a member of the spiritual Church possesses becomes the good of faith when he is regenerated. 
Not till then does it become the Lord's. </p>
<p></p>
<p><b>[4]</b>
 The law regarding the redemption of the firstborn of man was laid down to prevent them from sacrificing their sons, a practice that had come into 
use among gentiles with whom statutes of the Ancient Church - which was a representative Church - remained in force, but in a form that had been completely adulterated in the course of time. The consecration 
of the firstborn to God was one of those statutes of the Ancient Church; but by consecration they began to understand sacrifice. The descendants of Jacob leaned likewise towards the same practice, 
and therefore that law of redemption was marked out for them. And to prevent them from following that practice the Levites were adopted instead of the firstborn, as has been stated. The law was 
marked out in keeping with its corresponding meaning in the spiritual world, which is that the truths of faith are not holy, thus that these are not to be consecrated or ascribed to the Lord but forms 
of the good of faith. Later on that consecration to Him was taken to mean that they were to give or present the firstborn to Jehovah, and to offer a sacrifice for him, as the following stated in Luke 
shows, </p>
<blockquote>
When the days of their purification according to the law of Moses were completed, they brought Jesus to Jerusalem to present Him to the Lord (as it has been written in the Law of the Lord, 
that every male opening the womb should be called holy to the Lord) and to offer a sacrifice. <a href="http://bible.gospelcom.net/cgi-bin/bible?passage=Luke%202:22-24&amp;version=ESV&amp;interface=print&amp;showfn=yes&amp;showxref">Luke 2:22-24</a>.
