<h3 align="center" class="ired">属天的奥秘 第6431节</h3>
<h4 align="center"></h4><p><strong>6431.</strong>“伏于下面的深渊之福”表将属世层里面的记忆知识。这从“被赐福以福”是指被赋予诸如源于灵界的那类事物；“伏于下面的深渊”是指属世层中的记忆知识。相对于构成天的内层（参看<a href="6430.htm">6430</a>节），属世层被称为“伏于下面的深渊”。“伏于下面的深渊”因表示属世层，故也表示记忆知识，因为这些记忆知识及其快乐就在属世层里面，并构成它的生命。属灵人尤其如此，因为他通过记忆知识被引入真理，通过真理被引入良善。由此明显可知，“被赐福以伏于下面的深渊之福”表示被赋予属世层中的记忆知识，因而被赋予属世层中的真理。在摩西五经对约瑟的祝福中，“深渊”也表示属世层中的记忆知识的真理：<br />愿他的地蒙耶和华赐福；得天上的宝物、甘露，以及伏于下面的深渊。（申命记<a href="http://39-27.cn/申33.13.htm">33:13</a>）</p>

With the blessings of the deep that lieth beneath. That this signifies with the memory-knowledges that are in the natural, is evident from the signification of "being blessed with blessings," as being 
to be endowed with such things as are from the spiritual world; and from the signification of the "deep that lieth beneath," as being the memory-knowledges in the natural. It is relatively to the interiors 
(which are "heaven") that the natural is called "the deep that lieth beneath" (see above, n. 6430); and as the natural is signified by "the deep that lieth beneath," memory-knowledges are also 
signified, for these together with their delights are in the natural, and make its life, especially with the spiritual man, because by means of memory-knowledges he is introduced into truths, and by 
means of truths into good; from which it is evident that by "being blessed with the blessings of the deep that lieth beneath" is signified to be endowed with memory-knowledges, thus with truths, in the 
natural. By the "deep" are also signified the truths of memory-knowledge in the natural in the blessing of Joseph in Moses: </p>
<p>     Blessed of Jehovah be his land; for the precious things of heaven, for 
the dew, for the deep also that lieth beneath (Deut. 33:13). </p>

<p align="center"><b>Elliott(1983-1999) 6431</b></p><p><b>6431.</b>
'The blessings of the deep lying beneath' means with factual knowledge which belongs in the natural. This is clear from the meaning of 'being blessed with blessings' as being endowed with the kinds of 
things that derive from the spiritual world; and from the meaning of 'the deep lying beneath' as factual knowledge in the natural. The natural is called 'the deep lying beneath' when considered in relation 
to the interiors constituting the heaven spoken of above in <a href="6430.htm">6430</a>. And since the natural is meant by 'the deep lying beneath', so too is factual knowledge meant, for factual knowledge and its delights 
belong in the natural and compose its life. This is especially true of the spiritual man, for he is led through factual knowledge to truths, and through truths to good. From all this it is evident 
that 'being blessed with the blessings of the deep lying beneath' means being endowed in the natural with factual knowledge and so with truths. Factual knowledge that holds truths in it and that 
belongs in the natural is also meant by 'the deep' in the blessing of Joseph recorded in Moses,  </p>
<blockquote>
Blessed by Jehovah is his land, in regard to the precious things of heaven, to the dew, to the deep 
also lying beneath. <a href="http://bible.gospelcom.net/cgi-bin/bible?passage=Deut%2033:13&amp;version=ESV&amp;interface=print&amp;showfn=yes&amp;showxref">Deut 33:13</a>.

</p><b>6431.</b>
`Benedictionibus abyssi cubantis infra': quod significet scientificis quae in naturali, constat a significatione `benedici benedictionibus' quod sit (x)donari talibus quae sunt e (t)mundo spirituali; 
et ex significatione `abyssi cubantis infra' quod sint scientifica in naturali; naturale vocatur `abyssus cubans infra' respective ad interiora quae sunt caelum, de quo mox supra n. (x)6430; et quia 
naturale significatur per `abyssum cubantem infra', etiam significantur scientifica, nam scientifica cum eorum jucundis sunt in naturali et faciunt vitam ejus, (m)imprimis apud spiritualem hominem, nam 
is introducitur per scientifica in vera, et per vera in bonum(n); exinde patet quod per `benedici benedictionibus abyssi cubantis infra' significetur donari scientificis, ita veris, in naturali.  Per 
`abyssum etiam significantur vera scientifica in naturali in benedictione Josephi apud Mosen, Benedicta a Jehovah terra ejus, de pretiosis caeli, de rore, de abysso etiam jacente infra, Deut. xxxiii 13. </p>
