<h3 align="center" class="ired">属天的奥秘 第6809节</h3>
<h4 align="center"></h4><p><strong>6809.</strong>有一次，他们来到我这里，在我的记忆里搜索东西。灵人能以最高超的技艺来做这种事，因为当他们来到一个人那里时，就会在他记忆里看到他所知道的一切。所以，当这些水星灵搜索各种内容，包括我所去过的城市和地方时，我发现他们不想了解教堂、宫殿、房屋或街道，只想了解我所知道曾在这些地方发生的事，以及涉及那里的政府形式、居民的本性、习俗等等之类的事。因为在人的记忆里，这类事与地方紧密联系在一起；因此，当这些地方被回想起来时，这些事也浮现出来。我对水星灵的这种性情感到惊讶，于是就问他们为何无视这些地方的壮丽景色，只搜索那里所发生的事件和行动？他们说，他们不喜欢看物质、肉体或世俗物体，只喜欢看真正重要的东西。这次经历首先让我明白，在大人里面，水星灵与从物质或世俗事物抽象出来的真实事物的记忆有关。</p>

They once came to me and searched the things in my memory. (Spirits can do this with the utmost skill; for when they come to a man, they see in his memory everything he knows.) When therefore the spirits 
of Mercury searched out various things, and among others the cities and places where I had been, I observed that they did not wish to know about the churches, palaces, houses, and streets; but only 
what I knew to have been done in these places, and also matters relating to the government there, and to the genius and manners of the inhabitants, with other things like these; for such things cling 
to the places that are in man's memory, and therefore when the places are excited, these other things also come up. I wondered at this character of the spirits of Mercury, and I therefore asked why 
they passed by the magnificent features of the places, and only searched out the facts and doings there? They said they have no delight in looking at material, bodily, and earthly things, but only at 
real ones. From this it at once appeared that the spirits of that earth relate in the Grand Man to the memory of real things when abstracted from things material and earthly. </p>

On one occasion they came to me and investigated the contents of my memory. Spirits can do this with the greatest skill, for when they come to a person they see in his memory every item of what he knows. 
When therefore those spirits belonging to Mercury investigated its various contents, which included cities and other places where I had been, I noticed that they had no wish to know about churches, 
palaces, houses, or streets, only about the deeds I had heard of that had been performed in those places, also about anything that had to do with their form of government, or that had to do with the 
character and customs of the people there, and anything similar. For in a person's memory things like these are associated with places, and therefore when these places are called to mind those things 
present themselves as well. I was amazed that those spirits were of such a disposition and I therefore asked them why they ignored the magnificent sights in such places and investigated only the conduct 
of affairs and the deeds performed there. They said that they gained no delight out of looking at material, bodily, or earthly objects, only at things of real importance. This experience was what 
first made it evident to me that spirits belonging to that planet correlate in the Grand Man with the memory of things devoid of material and earthly associations. </p>

Quondam venerunt ad me, et inquisiverunt (c)illa quae in memoria mea essent, ({1}hoc spiritus sollertissime possunt facere, cum enim {2} ad hominem veniunt, {3}in memoria ejus vident {4} singula quae 
homo novit); cum itaque spiritus Mercurii inquisiverunt varia, et inter illa etiam urbes et loca ubi fueram, animadverti quod templa, palatia, domos, plateas, non vellent scire, sed modo illa quae audivi 
facta in locis illis, tum quae {5}essent regiminis ibi, quae geniorum et morum illis qui ibi, et similia; talia enim cum locis cohaerent in memoria apud hominem, quapropter cum loca excitantur, 
etiam subeunt illa.  {6}Quod tales essent, miratus sum, quare interrogabam cur praeterirent magnifica locorum, et modo res et facta ibi inquirerent; dicebant quod illis nulla delectatio sit spectare materialia, 
corporea, et terrestria, sed solum realia; inde primum (x)patuit quod illius telluris spiritus in Maximo Homine referrent memoriam rerum abstractarum a materialibus et terrestribus. 	@1 quod$ 	@2
