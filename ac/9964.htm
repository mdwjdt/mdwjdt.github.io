<h3 align="center" class="ired">属天的奥秘 第9964节</h3>
<h4 align="center"></h4><p><strong>9964.</strong>“或就近坛，在圣所供职的时候”表在代表主自己的代表中。这从以下事实清楚可知：祭坛是神性良善方面的主的主要代表（参看<a href="9714.htm">9714</a>节）；因此，“就近坛，在圣所供职”表示对主自己的敬拜。代表主的敬拜主要在于在祭坛上所献的燔祭和祭物（<a href="922.htm">922</a>，<a href="923.htm">923</a>，<a href="2180.htm">2180</a>，<a href="6905.htm">6905</a>，<a href="8680.htm">8680</a>，<a href="8936.htm">8936</a>节）。代表神性良善方面的主的敬拜在祭坛前进行，代表神性真理方面的主的敬拜在会幕里面进行。所以才说“进入会幕”表示代表天堂和教会的一切事物的敬拜（<a href="9963.htm">9963</a>节）；“就近坛”表示代表主自己的敬拜。因为天堂和教会是从主发出的神性真理的容器，从主发出的神性真理就是从祂的爱之良善发出的真理，这真理被植入在这良善也被接受的地方，因而被植入在主，就是那良善的源头被接受的地方。</p>

Or when they come near unto the altar to minister in what is holy. That this signifies in the representative worship of the Lord Himself, is evident from the fact that the altar was the chief representative 
of the Lord in respect to the Divine good (see n. 9714); thus "coming near unto the altar, and ministering there in what is holy" denotes the worship of the Lord Himself. The representative worship 
of the Lord consisted chiefly in burnt-offerings and sacrifices offered upon the altar (n. 922, 923, 2180, 6905, 8680, 8936); the representative worship of the Lord in respect to Divine good was 
at the altar, and the representative worship of Him in respect to Divine truth was in the Tent of meeting. Therefore it is said that by "going in into the Tent of meeting" is signified the representative 
worship of all things of heaven and of the church (n. 9963); and by "coming near unto the altar" is signified the representative worship of the Lord Himself; for heaven and the church are receptacles 
of the Divine truth that proceeds from the Lord. The Divine truth that proceeds from the Lord is the truth that proceeds from the good of His love, and it is implanted where this good also is received, 
consequently where the Lord is received, from whom is this good. </p>

'Or when they approach the altar to minister in the holy place' means in worship representative of the Lord Himself. This is clear from the consideration that the altar was the chief representative of 
the Lord in respect of Divine Good, see <a href="9714.htm">9714</a>, so that 'approaching the altar' and 'ministering in the holy place' there mean worship of the Lord Himself. The worship representative of the Lord consisted 
chiefly in burnt offerings and sacrifices offered on the altar, <a href="922.htm">922</a>, <a href="923.htm">923</a>, <a href="2180.htm">2180</a>, <a href="6905.htm">6905</a>, <a href="8680.htm">8680</a>, <a href="8936.htm">8936</a>. Worship representative of the Lord in respect of Divine Good took place at the altar, and worship 
representative of Him in respect of Divine Truth took place in the tent of meeting. This is the reason for saying that 'going into the tent of meeting' means worship representative of all things of heaven 
and the Church, <a href="9963.htm">9963</a>, and 'approaching the altar' worship representative of the Lord Himself. For heaven and the Church are recipients of Divine Truth emanating from the Lord, Divine Truth emanating 
from the Lord being truth emanating from the good of love that is His and implanted where that good is also received, consequently where the Lord, the Source of that good, is received.  </p>

oblatis super altari, n. 922, 923, 2180, 6905, 8680, 8936; cultus repraesentativus Domini quoad Divinum Bonum ad altare, (c)et cultus repraesentativus Ipsius quoad Divinum Verum in tentorio conventus; 
ideo dicitur quod per `intrare in tentorium conventus' significetur cultus repraesentativus omnium caeli et Ecclesiae, n. 9963, et per `accedere ad altare' cultus repraesentativus Ipsius Domini; 
caelum enim et Ecclesia sunt receptacula Divini Veri procedentis a Domino; Divinum Verum procedens a Domino est verum procedens (c)a bono amoris (d)Ipsius, ac implantatur ubi id bonum {5}etiam recipitur,
