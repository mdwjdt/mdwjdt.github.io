<h3 align="center" class="ired">属天的奥秘 第1561节</h3>
<h4 align="center"></h4><p><strong>1561.</strong>“亚伯兰又在那里求告耶和华的名”表那种状态下的内在敬拜。这从前面所说（<a href="440.htm">440</a>，<a href="1455.htm">1455</a>节）“求告耶和华的名”的含义清楚可知。此处由于状态相似，故经上提及“坛”，并和前章8节一样说他“求告耶和华的名”。它们的区别在于，与前者相比，此处所描述的状态是明晰的状态。当认知被植入在上面所描述的状态中时，它们就会使其明晰；当真理与良善通过认知与前者的属天状态结合时，其活动就用此处这些话来描述。敬拜本身无非是在内的属天之物发出的某种活动。没有活动，属天之物本身决不可能存在。敬拜是它的最初活动，因为这是属天之物表达自身的方式，它从中找到喜乐。源于爱与仁的一切良善构成本质的活动本身。</p><br />

<p><strong>[NCE]1561.</strong> The symbolism of and there Abram called on Jehovah's name as inward worship in that state is established by the symbolism of calling on Jehovah's name, dealt with before, in 搂搂<a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_1561/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_440" target=_top>440</a>, <a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_1561/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_1455" target=_top>1455</a>. The reason this verse mentions an altar and invocation of Jehovah's name, just as <a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_1561/bible_king-james-version_genesis_12_8" target=_top>Genesis 12:8</a> did, is that the two phases are similar. The difference is that the present phase has more light to it than the previous one. Knowledge grafted onto the earlier phase, as described [搂搂<a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_1561/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_1458" target=_top>1458</a>, <a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_1561/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_1548" target=_top>1548</a>], adds clarity to it.<br />When truth and goodness are connected through knowledge to the earlier, heavenly quality, its resulting active power is depicted in this way. Worship itself is simply action emerging from the heavenly character within. The heavenly core could never exist without activity. Worship is the first act that it emerges into, because that is how it expresses itself, since it senses joy in worship. Every good deed of love and charity is the essence itself of the active power. </p>
<p align="center"><b>Potts(1905-1910) 1561</b></p><p><b>1561.</b>
And there Abram called on the name of Jehovah. That this signifies the internal worship in that state, is evident from the signification of "calling on the name of Jehovah" (explained above, n. 440, 
1455). Here too, because of the similarity of the states, mention is made of an "altar," and it is said that he "called on the name of Jehovah," as was the case in the preceding chapter, verse 8; but 
there is this difference, that as compared with the former, the state here described is a lucid one. When knowledges are implanted in the state described above, they make it lucid; and when truth and 
good are conjoined with the former celestial state by means of knowledges, its activity is then described as in the words now before us; for worship itself is nothing but a certain activity coming forth 
from the celestial which is within. The celestial itself cannot possibly exist without activity. Worship is its first activity; for it puts itself forth in this way, because it perceives joy in it. 
All the good of love and of charity is essential activity itself. </p>

<p align="center"><b>Elliott(1983-1999) 1561</b></p><p><b>1561.</b>
'And there Abram called on the name of Jehovah' means internal worship in that state. This is clear from the meaning of 'calling on the name of Jehovah', dealt with already in <a href="440.htm">440</a> and <a href="1455.htm">1455</a>. The reason 
why here mention is also made of an altar and why, as likewise in verse 8 of the previous chapter, the phrase 'he called on the name of Jehovah' is used, is that they are similar states. They differ 
in that the latter compared with the former is a state of light. When cognitions are implanted in the former state, which has been described, they make it one of light. And when truth and good are joined 
by means of cognitions to the former celestial state, its activity is described by the words used here. Worship itself is nothing else than a particular activity that occurs because of the celestial 
within. The celestial itself can never exist without activity. Worship is the prime activity, for this is how the celestial expresses itself because it finds joy in it. All good springing from love 
and charity constitutes the essential activity itself. </p>

</p><b>1561.</b>
'Et invocavit ibi Abram nomen Jehovae': quod significet cultum internum in illo statu, constat a significatione 'invocare nomen Jehovae,' de qua prius n. 440 et 1455; quod hic quoque memoretur de altari 
et quod dicatur quod 'invocaverit nomen Jehovae' similiter ac in cap. praec. vers. 8, causa est quod similes status sint, cum differentia quod hic lucidus respective ad illum; cognitiones cum implantantur 
priori statui, de quo dictum, faciunt illum lucidum: quando conjungitur verum et bonum per cognitiones caelesti priori, tunc activam illius describitur ita; ipse cultus non est nisi activum 
quoddam existens ex caelesti quod est intus; ipsum caeleste nusquam potest esse absque activo; cultus est activum primum, nam ita se expromit, quia in illo gaudium percipit; omne bonum amoris et charitatis 
est ipsum activum essentiale. </p>
