<h3 align="center" class="ired">属天的奥秘 第7542节</h3>
<h4 align="center"></h4><p><strong>7542.</strong>“进入你心”表进入至内层。这从“心”的含义清楚可知，“心”是指属于人的意愿，因而属于他的爱之物（参看<a href="2930.htm">2930</a>，<a href="3313.htm">3313</a>，<a href="3888.htm">3888</a>，<a href="3889.htm">3889</a>节），因此是指他里面的实际生命的核心之物；因为他的爱本质上属于他的意愿，故构成他里面的真正生命。正因如此，“心”表示至内层。对善人来说，至内层是爱主爱邻；但对恶人来说，至内层是爱自己爱世界。此处所指的是后一种至内层。在这至内层周围，可以说构成它的周边部分的事物是邪恶和支持这些邪恶的虚假；这些邪恶和虚假照着它们支持这至内层的方式而被排列成次序。在来世，它们会照着它们被排列的次序而展开。首先出现的是占据最外围部分的事物，然后是占据更内层部分的事物；最后显露出来的是至内层。正因如此，在来世，一个人会经历众多状态；恶人在被投入地狱之前，会分阶段逐步冲进灾祸中，正如刚才所说的。他们最终到达的至内层，就是与他们同住的地狱本身；因为邪恶本身是他们的爱之核心，因而是他们在所行的一切事上关注并在世上深深隐藏起来的目的。</p>

Into thy heart. That this signifies into the inmost, is evident from the signification of the "heart," as being what is of the will, thus of the love (see n. 2930, 3313, 3888, 3889), consequently what 
is of the very life, for the love, being of the will, makes the very life; hence it is that by the "heart" is signified the inmost. The inmost with the good is love to the Lord and love toward the neighbor, 
but the inmost with the evil is the love of self and the love of the world; it is this inmost that is here meant. The things that are around this inmost and make as it were its circumferences, 
are evils with the falsities which favor them; and these are disposed in the order in which they favor. In the other life these are unrolled according to the order in which they have been disposed; 
first come forth those which occupy the outermost circumferences; afterward those which occupy the more interior ones; and at last the inmost is made manifest. Hence it is that a man in the other life 
passes through many states, and that by degrees, successively, the evil run into plagues, before they are cast into hell, according to what has just been said. The inmost, to which they finally come, 
is hell itself with them, for it is the evil itself which had been of their love, thus the end for the sake of which they had done all things, and which in the world they had most deeply hidden. </p>

'Onto your heart' means into what is inmost. This is clear from the meaning of 'heart' as that which belongs to a person's will, thus to his love, dealt with in <a href="2930.htm">2930</a>, <a href="3317.htm">3317</a>, <a href="3888.htm">3888</a>, <a href="3889.htm">3889</a>, consequently what 
is central to the actual life within him; for his love, belonging intrinsically to his will, constitutes that life within him. This is why 'heart' means what is inmost. What is inmost in the case 
of the good is love to the Lord and love towards the neighbour, whereas what is inmost in the case of the evil is self-love and love of the world. The latter is what is meant here; and what is around 
it, constituting so to speak the surrounding parts, are the evils and falsities that lend support, arranged into order according to the ways in which they support it. In the next life they are brought 
out into the open in the order in which they have been arranged. First to come forth are those that occupy the outermost surrounding parts, then those that lie further in; and finally what is inmost 
is revealed. So it is that a person in the next life passes through a large number of states, and that the evil are afflicted in successive stages by scourges or plagues before they are cast into hell, 
as accords with what has been stated immediately above. What is inmost, which they come to last of all, is hell itself residing with them, for it is the evil that had been central to their love, and 
so the end which they held in view in everything they did and which in the world they had kept deeply hidden within them. </p>

`In cor tuum': quod significet in intimum, constat ex significatione `cordis' quod sit id quod voluntatis est, ita quod amoris, de qua n. 2930, 3313, 3888, 3889, consequenter quod ipsius vitae est, 
nam amor, {1}quia est voluntatis, facit ipsam vitam; inde est quod per `cor' significetur intimum; intimum apud bonos est amor in Dominum et amor erga proximum, intimum autem apud malos est amor sui et 
amor mundi; hoc intimum est quod hic intelligitur; quae circum intimum sunt, ac peripherias quasi constituunt, sunt mala cum falsis quae favent; et haec eo ordine disposita sunt, quo favent.  In altera 
vita evolvuntur haec secundum ordinem quo disposita sunt, primum prodeunt illa quae ultimas peripherias tenent, postea quae interiores, et tandem manifestatur intimum; inde est quod {2}homo in altera 
vita percurrat plures status, et quod mali per gradus successive incurrant plagas, antequam conjiciuntur in infernum, secundum illa quae mox supra {3} dicta sunt; intimum, ad quod demum perveniunt, 
est ipsum infernum apud illos, nam est ipsum malum quod fuerat amoris illorum, ita finis propter quem omnia egerant et quem in mundo intime recondiderant. 	@1 qui$ 	@2 percurrant$ 	@3 i n. 7541$ </p>
