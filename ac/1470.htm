<h3 align="center" class="ired">属天的奥秘 第1470节</h3>
<h4 align="center"></h4><p><strong>1470.</strong>“看哪，我知道你是容貌俊美的妇人”表出于属天源头的真理令人喜爱。这从“容貌俊美的妇人”的含义清楚可知。凡属天的，或属天之物所产生的真理都是内在人中幸福的源泉，并在外在人中令人喜爱；属天天使对真理只有这种感觉。然而，若这真理不是来自属天的源头，情况则完全不同。内在人中的幸福有两种，与之相对应的是外在人中的两种快乐；一种属于良善，另一种属于真理。属天的幸福快乐属于良善，属灵的幸福快乐属于真理。此外，众所周知，真理本身就带有幸福快乐。不过，只有当真理来自属天之物时，这些本质上才具有这样的性质。因为那时，真理本身变得属天，被称为属天的真理。这真理还好比春光，这光本身就蕴含热，地上万物由此生发，仿佛复活。这属天的真理就是美物本身，或美丽本身。这就是此处被称为“容貌俊美的妇人”的真理。从下文明显可知，这些话蕴含更深的奥秘。</p><br />

<p><strong>[NCE]1470.</strong> The fact that consider, please; I know that you are a woman beautiful to see, means that truth from a heavenly source is appealing can be seen from the symbolism of a woman beautiful to see. All truth that is heavenly, or that develops out of something heavenly, is blissful for our inner self and appealing to our outer self, and that is exactly how heavenly angels perceive truth. The situation is wholly different, though, when truth is not from a heavenly source.<br />There are two kinds of happiness in a person's inner self and two kinds of pleasure corresponding to them in the outer self; one is associated with goodness and the other with truth. Heavenly happiness and pleasure come from goodness; spiritual happiness and pleasure come from truth. It is common knowledge that truth itself brings happiness and pleasure, but the happiness and pleasure are quintessential when they come from a heavenly origin. Their presence renders the truth itself heavenly as well, and then it is called heavenly truth. It bears a resemblance to sunlight in the spring, which enfolds in itself a warmth that makes all the vegetation on earth grow and gives them something almost like animal life. This heavenly kind of truth is beauty itself, and it is what is here called a woman beautiful to see.<br />Any additional secrets wrapped up in this clause will come out in what follows.{*1} <br /><strong>Footnotes:</strong><br />{*1} Sections 1480, 1484a may be the passages where this exposition of further secrets appears.

Behold I pray, I know that thou art a woman beautiful to look upon. That this signifies that truth from a celestial origin is delightful, is evident from the signification of "a woman beautiful to look 
upon." All truth that is celestial, or that is produced from the celestial, is happy in the internal man, and delightful in the external, and with the celestial angels is so perceived; but it is altogether 
otherwise when it is not from a celestial origin. There are two kinds of happiness in the internal man, to which correspond two kinds of delight in the external man; one is of good, the other 
is of truth; celestial happiness and delight are of good, spiritual happiness and delight are of truth. It is also known that truth itself is attended with happiness and delight, but these are essentially 
such only when the truth is from what is celestial, for then the truth itself also becomes celestial, and is called celestial truth. To speak comparatively, truth is then like the light of the sun 
in the springtime, which has heat in its bosom, from which all things on the earth are made to vegetate, and are as it were animated. This celestial truth is the beautiful itself, or beauty itself. 
This is the truth which is here called "a woman beautiful to look upon." What further arcana are involved in these words, will be manifest from what follows. </p>

'Behold now, I know that you are a beautiful woman to look upon' means that truth from a celestial origin is delightful. This becomes clear from the meaning of 'a woman beautiful to look upon'. Every 
truth that is celestial, that is, which is brought forth from what is celestial, is a source of happiness in the internal man and of delight in the external; and among celestial angels truth is not perceived 
in any other way. It is altogether different however when it does not have a celestial origin. There are two kinds of happiness in the internal man to which two kinds of delight in the external 
man correspond. One belongs to good, the other to truth. Celestial happiness and delight go with good, spiritual happiness and delight with truth. Furthermore it is well known that truth holds happiness 
and delight within it, though these are essentially such only when the truth flows from what is celestial, and therefore when the truth itself becomes celestial and is called celestial truth. This 
truth may also be compared to the light of the sun in spring, which light carries within it the warmth which causes everything on earth to start to grow and so to speak to come alive. This celestial 
truth is beauty or beautifulness itself, and is the kind of truth meant here by the words 'a beautiful woman to look upon'. What further arcana are embodied in these words will become evident from what follows </p>

</p><b>1470.</b>
Quod 'Ecce quaeso, novi quod femina pulchra aspectu tu' significet quod verum a caelesti origine jucundum sit, constare potest a significatione 'feminae pulchrae aspectu'; omne verum quod caeleste est 
seu quod ex caelesti producitur, est felix in interno homine et jucundum in externo; non aliter percipitur verum apud angelos caelestes; aliter prorsus cum non ab origine caelesti; sunt duo felicia 
in interno homine, quibus correspondent duo jucunda in externo homine; unum est boni, alterum est veri; felix et jucundum caeleste est boni, felix et jucundum spirituale est veri; notum quoque est quod 
ipsum verum secum habeat felicitatem et jucunditatem, sed tunc essentialem cum a caelesti est, inde ipsum verum quoque fit caeleste, et appellatur caeleste verum; estque comparative sicut lux solis 
tempore veris, quae in sinu suo habet calorem ex quo omnia in tellure vegetantur et quasi animantur; caeleste illud verum est ipsum pulchrum seu ipsa pulchritudo; hoc verum est quod dicitur hic 'femina 
pulchra aspecta': quae praeterea arcana hoc involvit, patebit a sequentibus. </p>
