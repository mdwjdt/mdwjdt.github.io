<h3 align="center" class="ired">属天的奥秘 第2498节</h3>
<h4 align="center"></h4><p><h4 align="center">内义</h4><br />2498.这些历史事件和圣言中的其它事一样，都包含神性奥秘。这从以下事实清楚可知：现在亚伯拉罕再次称他的妻子为他的妹子，因为他进入埃及时曾做这种事，那时他对撒拉说：“求你说，你是我的妹子”（创世记<a href="http://39-27.cn/创12.13.htm">12:13</a>）。不止亚伯拉罕，以撒也做过这种事。以撒来到基拉耳时，称他的妻子利百加为他的妹子，即“那地方的人问到他的妻子，他便说，那是我的妹子”（创世记<a href="http://39-27.cn/创26.6.htm">26:6</a>-<a href="http://39-27.cn/创26.7.htm">7</a>）。那两章还有其它类似细节，这类历史事件提到过三次；若非内义中有某种隐藏的原因，这是绝不可能的事。</p>

THE INTERNAL SENSE That these historical matters, like all the other things of the Word, involve Divine arcana, is evident from the fact that Abraham now again said that his wife was his sister; for 
the same thing had occurred when he came into Egypt; for he then said to Sarah, "Say, I pray, thou art my sister" (Gen. 12:13). And not Abraham alone, but Isaac likewise, when he came to Gerar, said 
that his wife Rebecca was his sister: "The men of that place asked concerning his wife, and he said, She is my sister" (Gen. 26:6-7); and there are other things in the same chapters that resemble each 
other, so that such historical matters are related three times; which, without a hidden cause in the internal sense, would by no means have been done. </p>

THE INTERNAL SENSE </p>
<p>These historical descriptions, like everything else in the Word, embody Divine arcana. This becomes clear from the fact that now, for a second time, Abraham said that his wife was 
his sister; for the same thing had happened when he entered Egypt. On that occasion he said to Sarah, 'Say, now, you are my sister', <a href="http://bible.gospelcom.net/cgi-bin/bible?passage=Gen%2012:%2013&amp;version=ESV&amp;interface=print&amp;showfn=yes&amp;showxref">Gen 12: 13</a>. And not only Abraham but also Isaac did so, in that 
when he came to Gerar he said that Rebekah his wife was his sister - 'The men of the place asked about his wife, and he said, She is my sister', <a href="http://bible.gospelcom.net/cgi-bin/bible?passage=Gen%2026:%206,%207&amp;version=ESV&amp;interface=print&amp;showfn=yes&amp;showxref">Gen 26: 6, 7</a>. And in those two chapters further similarities 
occur, so that such historical incidents are described three times, which would never have been done but for some hidden reason in the internal sense. </p>

{1}                         SENSUS INTERNUS </p>
<p>Quod haec historica, sicut omnia reliqua quae sunt Verbi, arcana Divina involvant, constare potest ex eo quod Abraham nunc iterum dixerit uxorem suam esse 
sororem, nam simile factum fuit cum venit in Aegyptum, dixit enim tunc ad Saram, `Dic quaeso, Soror mea tu,' Gen. xii 13: nec solum Abraham, sed etiam Isacus cum venit Gerarem, dixit etiam ille quod 
Rebecca uxor ejus esset soror, `Quaesiverunt viri loci de uxore ejus, et dixit, Soror mea es Gen. xxvi 6, 7: in quibus capitibus etiam plura similia occurrunt; sic ut ter talia historica relata sint, 
quod absque arcana causa in sensu, interno, nusquam factum fuisset. 	@1 This [ ] is omitted in first draft (see note p. 330).$ </p>
