<h3 align="center" class="ired">属天的奥秘 第6484节</h3>
<h4 align="center"></h4><p><strong>6484.</strong>有一个灵人曾深信这个观点：没有任何事是圣治或天命所为；相反，每一件事都是出于聪明，以及运气和偶然机会。他承认运气的存在，只是不知道运气是什么。他是狡诈的恶灵之一，因为他花在思考上的时间，比花在与别人交谈和来往上的多。进入来世后，如每个人通常所行的那样，他在那里仍延续他以前的生活。他四处寻求并学习一切事，包括法术；他以为法术可能对他有用，有助于他寻找自己的幸福。我与他交谈，他说，当事情是这样时，他就在自己的天堂里；除了他为自己所造的天堂外，绝无可能存在其它天堂。但我被引导回答说，一旦真正的天堂流入他的天堂，他的天堂就会变成地狱。当时，他在灵人界；当灵人在灵人界时，他们会体验到他们在世时所拥有的爱之快乐（参看<a href="5852.htm">5852</a>节）。恰好在那一刻，天堂流入这个灵人的快乐，他忽然有了地狱的感觉。惊恐之下，他说，他从来没有想到这种事。一些善灵告诉我说，他比其他人更坏，因为他所流出的东西比其他人所流出的更狡诈。<br />后来，这个灵人被带回到他小时候的状态。主向天使展示了那时他是何品质，以及所预见的他未来的生活是何品质；其生活的每个细节都被主引导；否则，也就是说，如果主的圣治或天命的持续关注稍有中断，他早就一头栽入最恐怖的地狱了。这一点以可视的方式呈现在天使面前。这个灵人还被问及他是否想过永生。他说，他不信永生，并把这一类的一切事都抛到一边，因为他看见如此多的混乱，义人遭难，恶人得意，等等。他说，他还看到，动物拥有和人一样的感官，一样的生命，以及观察力和聪明。所以他认为，他死亡时，和动物是一样的。他继续说，当他发现自己死后仍活着时，完全惊呆了。</p>

There was a certain one who had confirmed himself in the notion that nothing is of the Divine Providence, but that each and all things are of sagacity, and are also from fortune and chance. He granted 
that there is fortune, but knew not what it is. He was one of the subtle evil spirits, because he had been more given to thought than to speech and conversation. When he came into the other life he 
continued there his former life, as all do; he sought out and learned all things-even magical arts-that he supposed might be of service to him, and by means of which he might take such care of himself 
as to be fortunate from himself. I conversed with him, and he said that he was in his heaven when this was the case, and that there could not possibly be any other heaven than that which he made for 
himself. But it was given to answer that his heaven is turned into hell as soon as the real heaven flows into it. He was then in the world of spirits, and when spirits are there they are in the delights 
of the loves in which they had been in the world (see n. 5852). But it then came to pass that heaven flowed into his delight, and he then suddenly felt hell, and said with horror that he had never 
believed this. I was told by good spirits that he was worse than the others because there was a more subtle influx from him than from the others. Afterward the same spirit was reduced into the state of 
his infancy, and the Lord showed the angels what his quality had been at that time, and also what was the then foreseen quality of his future life, and that every detail of his life had been led by 
the Lord, and that he would have plunged into the most atrocious hell if there had been even the least cessation of the continual providence of the Lord. This can be presented to view before the angels. 
He was also asked whether he had ever thought about eternal life. He said that he had not believed in it, and that he had rejected everything of the kind, because he saw so much confusion, the righteous 
suffering, and the wicked glorying, with other such things; also because he saw that brute animals have similar senses and life, also discernment and sagacity; thus he had believed that he should 
die as they do. He said that he had been in the utmost amazement when he perceived that he lived after death. </p>

There was a certain spirit who had become quite convinced that nothing was the work of Divine Providence, but that every single thing was attributable to prudence, and also to fortune and chance. He 
asserted the existence of fortune yet did not know what it was. He was one of the evil spirits who are crafty, for he had spent more time in thinking than in talking to and mixing with others. When he 
entered the next life he continued there the life he had led previously, as everyone usually does. He enquired after and also learned about everything - including magical devices - which he thought might 
be of service to him, in looking out for his own happiness. I talked to him and he said that he was in his heaven when things were thus, and that no other heaven could possibly exist than that which 
he created for himself. But I was led to reply that his kind of heaven is turned into hell as soon as heaven as it really is flows into it. (That spirit was at this time in the world of spirits, and 
when people are there they experience the joys associated with the loves that ruled them when they were in the world, <a href="5852.htm">5852</a>). It so happened that at that point heaven flowed into that spirit's joy, 
and suddenly he had the feeling of hell. Horrified by it he said that he would never have believed it. Some good spirits told me that he was more wicked than all the rest, for what flowed from him had 
more craftiness in it than what flowed from others. </p>

 After this the same spirit was taken back into the state of his early childhood. The Lord showed the angels what that state had been like, and 
also what his future life was foreseen to be like. It was shown that every specific detail of his life had been subject to the Lord's guidance, and that if it had not been he would have thrown himself 
headlong into an utterly horrible hell, that is, if there had been the smallest lapse in the constant watch kept by the Lord's Providence, as can be demonstrated to the angels in a visual manner. 
The spirit was also asked whether he ever thought about eternal life. He said that he had no belief in it and cast aside everything of the kind, for the reason that he saw so much confusion, the suffering 
of the righteous and boasting of the wicked, and the like. He also saw, he said, that animals have senses similar to men's, and similar life, as well as powers of observation and prudence. So his 
belief was that when he died he would be like them. He went on to say that he was utterly amazed when he realized that he was alive after death. </p>

Quidam erat qui se confirmaverat in eo quod nihil Providentiae Divinae esset, sed quod omnia et singula essent ex prudentia, tum a fortuna et casu; fortunam statuebat sed nesciebat quid esset; erat 
ille inter spiritus malos subtiles, quia cogitationi plus indulserat quam sermoni et conversationi; cum in alteram vitam venit, continuabat ibi vitam priorem, ut solent omnes; inquisivit et quoque hausit 
omnia quae ei inservire posse putabat, per quae sibi ipsi consuleret, {1}ut ex se faustus esset, etiam artificia magica.  Locutus sum cum illo, et dicebat quod in suo caelo esset cum ita, et quod 
aliud caelum non posset dari quam quod ipse sibi faceret; sed respondere datum est quod {2}ejus caelum vertatur in infernum, ut primum ipsum caelum in (c)illud influit; erat tunc in mundo spirituum, et 
cum ibi, sunt in jucundis amorum in quibus fuerant in mundo, n. 5852; at tunc factum quod caelum influeret in ejus jucundum, ac subito tunc sensit infernum, ac horrescens dicebat quod  hoc nunquam crediderit; 
dictum mihi a spiritibus bonis quod is pejor reliquis esset, quia ab illo influxus subtilior quam ab aliis.  [2]Postea idem redactus est in statum infantiae suae, et a Domino ostensum angelis 
qualis tunc fuerat, et  quoque tunc qualis ejus vita futura quae praevisa, et quod singula ejus vitae ducta fuerint a Domino, et quod alioquin se praecipitavisset in atrocissimum infernum, si vel minimum 
a Domini Providentia continua cessavisset; hoc potest angelis sisti videndum{3}.  Interrogatus etiam fuit, num usquam cogitaverit de {4}vita aeterna, dicebat quod non crediderit, et quod rejecerit 
omnia illa, ex causa quia videret tam multa confusa, justum pati et impium gloriari, et similia; tum quod videret bruta animalia habere similes sensus, similem vitam, et quoque animadvertentiam et 
prudentiam, sic credens se moriturum sicut illa; et quod in maximum stuporem venerit cum apperciperet se post mortem vivere. @1 et $ @2 hoc$ @3 i inde quoque scire datum, quod Providentia Domini sit
