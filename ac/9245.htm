<h4 align="center"></h4><p><strong>9245.</strong>只有那些照信仰的指示或戒律生活的人才拥有信仰，主在约翰福音中教导了这一点：<br />光来到世间，世人因自己的行为是恶的，不爱光倒爱黑暗。凡作恶的便恨光，并不来就光，恐怕他的行为受责备。但行真理的必来就光，好显明他的行为，因为它们是靠神而行出的。（约翰福音<a href="http://39-27.cn/约3.19.htm">3:19</a>-<a href="http://39-27.cn/约3.21.htm">21</a>）<br />“来就光”表示获得对主之信，因而获得来自主的信。祂在路加福音也教导了这一点：<br />你们为什么称呼我主啊，主啊，却不遵我的话行呢？凡到我这里来，听见我的话就去行的，就像一个人盖房子，把根基安在磐石上。惟有听见不去行的，就像一个人在地上盖房子，没有根基。（路加福音<a href="http://39-27.cn/路6.46.htm">6:46</a>-<a href="http://39-27.cn/路6.49.htm">49</a>）<br />“遵主的话而行”的，是那些爱邻爱主的人；因为一个去爱的人也会去行（约翰福音<a href="http://39-27.cn/约14.20.htm">14:20</a>，<a href="http://39-27.cn/约14.21.htm">21</a>，<a href="http://39-27.cn/约14.23.htm">23</a>，<a href="http://39-27.cn/约14.24.htm">24</a>；<a href="http://39-27.cn/约15.9.htm">15:9</a>-<a href="http://39-27.cn/约15.17.htm">17</a>）。</p>

That those alone are in Faith who live according to the precepts of Faith, the Lord teaches in John: </p>
<p>     The light is come into the world, but men loved the darkness rather than the light, because 
their works were evil. Everyone that doeth evils hateth the light, and cometh not to the light, lest his works should be reproved. But he that doeth the truth cometh to the light, that his works may be 
made manifest, because they have been wrought in God (John 3:19-21); </p>
<p>to "come to the light" denotes to come to faith in the Lord, thus to faith from the Lord. In like manner in Luke: </p>
<p>     Why call 
ye Me, Lord, Lord, and do not the thing which I say? Everyone that cometh unto Me, and heareth My saying, and doeth them, is like a man that built a house, and laid a foundation upon the rock. But he 
that heareth, and doeth not, is like a man that built a house upon the earth without a foundation (Luke 6:46-49); </p>
<p>those who "do the Lord's sayings" or "words" are those who love the neighbor and love 
the Lord; for he who loves, does (John 14:20, 21, 23, 24; 15:9-17). </p>
<p>     EXODUS 23 </p>
<p>     1. Thou shalt not take up a report of emptiness. Put not thy hand with the wicked to be a witness of violence.  
    2. Thou shalt not be after many to do evils; and thou shalt not answer upon a cause to turn aside after many to pervert it.      3. And thou shalt not reverence a poor man in his cause.  
    4. When thou shalt meet thine enemy's ox, or his ass, going astray, bringing back thou shalt bring it back to him.      5. When thou shalt see the ass of him that hateth thee lying under his burden, 
and wouldest forbear to remove it for him, removing thou shalt remove it with him.      6. Thou shalt not wrest the judgment of thy needy in his cause.      7. Keep thee far from the word of a 
lie; and the innocent and the righteous slay thou not; for I will not justify the wicked.      8. And thou shalt not take a present, because a present blindeth those who have their eyes open, and perverteth 
the words of the righteous.      9. And a sojourner shalt thou not oppress; for ye know the soul of a sojourner, seeing that ye were sojourners in the land of Egypt.      10. And six years 
thou shalt sow thy land, and shalt gather the produce thereof.      11. And in the seventh thou shalt let it lie fallow, and shalt release it; and the needy of thy people shall eat; and what they leave 
the wild animal of the field shall eat. So shalt thou do to thy vineyard, and to thine oliveyard.      12. Six days thou shalt do thy works, and on the seventh day thou shalt cease; that thine ox 
and thine ass may rest; and the son of thy handmaid, and the sojourner, may take breath.      13. And all that I have said unto you ye shall keep; and ye shall not mention the name of other gods; it 
shall not be heard upon thy mouth.      14. Three times thou shalt keep a feast unto Me in the year.      15. The feast of unleavened things shalt thou keep; seven days thou shalt eat unleavened things, 
as I commanded thee, at the time appointed of the month Abib; because in it thou camest forth out of Egypt; and My faces shall not be seen empty.      16. And the feast of the harvest, of the firstfruits 
of thy works, which thou sowedst in the field; and the feast of ingathering, in the going out of the year, when thou gatherest in thy works out of the field.      17. Three times in the year 
shall every male of thine appear before the faces of the Lord Jehovih.      18. Thou shalt not sacrifice the blood of My sacrifice upon what is fermented; and the fat of My feast shall not remain overnight 
until the morning.      19. The first of the firstfruits of thy ground thou shalt bring into the house of Jehovah thy God. Thou shalt not boil a kid in its mother's milk.      20. Behold I 
send an angel before thee, to guard thee in the way, and to bring thee to the place which I have prepared.      21. Take heed of his face, and hear his voice, lest thou provoke him; for he will not endure 
your transgression; because My name is in the midst of him.      22. For if hearing thou shalt hear his voice, and do all that I speak, I will act as an enemy against thine enemies, and I will 
act as an adversary against thine adversaries.      23. When Mine angel shall go before thee, and shall bring thee unto the Amorite, and the Hittite, and the Perizzite, and the Canaanite, the Hivite, 
and the Jebusite; and I shall cut him off.      24. Thou shalt not bow down thyself to their gods, and shalt not serve them, and shalt not do after their works; for destroying thou shalt destroy them, 
and breaking shalt break in pieces their statues.      25. And ye shall serve Jehovah your God, and He shall bless thy bread, and thy waters; and I will take away disease from the midst of thee.  
    26. There shall not be one miscarrying, or barren, in thy land; the number of thy days I will fulfil.      27. I will send My terror before thee, and I will trouble all the people to whom thou shalt 
come, and I will give to thee the neck of all thine enemies.      28. And I will send the hornet before thee, and it shall drive out the Hivite, the Canaanite, and the Hittite, from before thee.  
    29. I will not drive him out from before thee in one year; lest perchance the land be desolate, and the wild beast of the field be multiplied upon thee.      30. By little and little I will drive 
him out from before thee, until thou be fruitful, and inherit the land.      31. And I will set thy border from the sea Suph, and even unto the sea of the Philistines, and from the wilderness even 
unto the river; for I will give into your hand the inhabitants of the land; and I will drive them out from before thee.      32. Thou shalt not make a covenant with them, and with their gods.     
 33. They shall not dwell in thy land, lest perchance they make thee sin against Me when thou shalt serve their gods; because it will be a snare to thee. </p>

The fact that those alone possess faith who lead lives in keeping with the prescriptions of faith is the Lord's teaching in John,  </p>
<blockquote>
Light has come into the world, but men preferred darkness rather 
than light, because their deeds were evil. Everyone who performs evil deeds hates the light and does not come to the light lest his deeds should be exposed. He however who does the truth comes to the 
light, so that his deeds may be clearly seen, because they have been wrought in God. <a href="http://bible.gospelcom.net/cgi-bin/bible?passage=John%203:19-21&amp;version=ESV&amp;interface=print&amp;showfn=yes&amp;showxref">John 3:19-21</a>.  
</blockquote>
<p>'Coming to the light' means attaining faith in the Lord, thus attaining faith from the Lord. The 
like is taught by Him in Luke,  </p>
<blockquote>
Why do you call Me, Lord, Lord, and do not do what I say? Everyone who comes to Me, and hears My words and does them, is like a man building a house, who laid the foundation 
upon rock. But one who hears and does not do [them] is like a man building a house on ground without a foundation. <a href="http://bible.gospelcom.net/cgi-bin/bible?passage=Luke%206:46-end&amp;version=ESV&amp;interface=print&amp;showfn=yes&amp;showxref">Luke 6:46-end</a>.  
</blockquote>
<p>'Those who do the Lord's words' are people who love their 
neighbour and love the Lord; for one who loves also does, <a href="http://bible.gospelcom.net/cgi-bin/bible?passage=John%2014:20,%2021,%2023,%2024;%2015:9-17&amp;version=ESV&amp;interface=print&amp;showfn=yes&amp;showxref">John 14:20, 21, 23, 24; 15:9-17</a>.  </p>

bovi inimici tui, vel asino ejus, erranti, reducendo reduces eum illi. 5.  Cum videris asinum osoris tui cubantem sub onere suo, et cessaveris a removendo ei, removendo removebis cum illo. 6.  Non 
declinabis judicium egeni tui in lite ejus. 7.  A verbo mendacii elongabis te, ac innocentem et justum ne occidas, quia non justificabo improbum. 8.  Et munus non accipies, quia munus occaecat apertos 
oculis, et pervertit verba justorum. 9.  Et peregrinum non opprimes; et vos nostis animam peregrini, quia peregrini fuistis in terra Aegypti. 10.  Et sex annis seres terram tuam et colliges proventum 
ejus. 11.  Et septimo intermittes eam et dimittes eam, et comedent egeni populi tui; et residuum illorum (x)comedet fera agri; ita facies vineae tuae, oliveto tuo. 12.  Sex diebus facies opera 
tua, et die septimo cessabis, propterea ut requiescat bos tuus et asinus tuus, et respiret filius ancillae tuae, et peregrinus. 13.  Et omne quod dixi ad vos custodietis; et nomen deorum aliorum non 
memorabitis, (x) non audietur super ore tuo. 14. Tribus vicibus feriaberis Mihi in anno. 15.  Festum azymorum custodies; septem diebus comedes azyma, quemadmodum praecepi tibi, ad statum tempus mensis 
Abib, quia in eo exivisti ex Aegypto; et non videbuntur facies Meae vacue. 16.  Et festum messis, primitiarum operum tuorum, quae seminaveras in agro; et festum collectionis in exitu anni, in colligendo

introduces domum JEHOVAE DEI tui; non coques haedum in lacte matris suae. 20.  Ecce Ego mitto angelum ante te, ad custodiendum te in via, et ad perducendum te ad locum quem praeparavi. 21.  Custodi

illum, 24.  Non incurvabis te diis illorum, et non servies illis, et non facies secundum opera illorum, quia destruendo destrues illos, et confringendo confringes statuas illorum. 25.  Et servietis 
JEHOVAE DEO vestro, et benedicet pani tuo e aquis tuis, et removebo morbum e medio tui. 26.  Non erit abortiens et sterilis in terra tua; numerum dierum tuorum implebo. 27.  Terrorem Meum mittam 
ante te, et turbabo omnem populum ad quos veneris, et dabo omnes inimicos tuos ad te cervicem. 28.  Et mittam crabronem ante te, et expellet Chivaeum Cananaeum, et Chittaeum ab ante te. 29.  Non 
expellam illum ab ante te in anno uno, ne forte sit terra desolata, et multiplicetur super te fera agri. 30.  Parum parum expellam illum ab ante te, usque dum fructificeris et heredites terram. 31.
