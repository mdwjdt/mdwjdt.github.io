<h3 align="center" class="ired">属天的奥秘 第8439节</h3>
<h4 align="center"></h4><p><strong>8439.</strong>“你们就走近耶和华面前”表这流注被领受并应用所在的状态。这从“走近耶和华面前”的含义清楚可知，“走近耶和华面前”是指流注（参看<a href="8159.htm">8159</a>节），因而也指领受；领受就是对流注的回应，因为这二者彼此回应。一个人领受来自神的流注到何等程度，可以说他在何等程度上“走近祂面前”。就灵义而言，走近耶和华面前并非表示别的，因为能使一个人走近祂的，是信和爱；由于信和爱来自耶和华，也就是来自主，所以“走近祂”也指对从祂流入的良善和真理的领受。它之所以也表示应用，是因为若不应用它，也就是说，将它付诸于用，领受它毫无价值。事实上，从神流入的东西首先进入属于人的理解力的觉知；从那里进入他的意愿，接着进入行为，就是善行，即功用，并在此达到目标或停止。当来自主的良善和真理的流注完成这段旅程时，良善和真理就变成此人自己的；因为此时它们一路流入秩序的最后一层，也就是流入自然界的最后一层，一切神性流注都旨在来到这一层。神性流注若在此人里面如此一路前行，那么这人可称作“天堂之路”。由此可见“走近耶和华面前”表示这流注被领受并付诸于用所在的状态；在此表示领受“吗哪”所表示的良善和“鹌鹑”所表示的快乐所在的一种状态。</p>

Come ye near before Jehovah. That this signifies a state of reception and the application thereto, is evident from the signification of "coming near before Jehovah," as being influx (see n. 8159), and 
therefore also reception; for reception is the reciprocal of influx, because they correspond to each other. Insofar as a man receives the Divine influx, so far he is said to "come near before Him." 
In the spiritual sense the coming near before Jehovah is nothing else, for coming near to Him is effected by means of faith and love; and as both faith and love are from Jehovah (that is, from the Lord), 
"coming near to Him" also denotes the reception of the good and truth that flow in from Him. That it also denotes application, is because reception is not anything unless there is also application, 
namely, to use. For the influx from the Divine passes first into the perception which is of the understanding with the man, thence it passes into the will, and next into act, that is, into good work, 
which is use, and there it ceases. When the influx of good and truth from the Lord makes this passage, then the good and truth are appropriated to the man; for then the influx goes down into the ultimate 
of order, that is, into the ultimate of nature, whither all Divine influx aims to come. The man in whom Divine influx thus advances may be called "a way of heaven." From all this it can now be seen 
that by "coming near before Jehovah" is signified a state of reception and the application thereto; here, a state of reception of the good signified by "the manna," and of the delight signified by 
"the quail." </p>

<p align="center"><b>Elliott(1983-1999) 8439</b></p><p><b>8439.</b>
'Come near before Jehovah' means a state in which that influx is accepted and applied. This is clear from the meaning of 'coming near before Jehovah' as influx, dealt with in <a href="8159.htm">8159</a>, and therefore also 
acceptance, acceptance being the response to influx since the two answer to each other. To the extent that a person accepts influx from God he is said to come near before Him; nothing other than this 
is meant in the spiritual sense by 'coming near before Jehovah'. What enables a person to draw near Him is faith and love; and since both faith and love come from Jehovah, that is, from the Lord, drawing 
near Him is also the acceptance of goodness and truth flowing in from Him. The reason why applying is also meant is that receiving it has no value unless it is applied, that is to say, put to a useful 
purpose. For what flows in from God passes first into perception, which belongs to a person's understanding; from there it passes into his will, and after that into action, that is, into a good 
deed, which is the useful purpose, and in this reaches its goal. When this passage of goodness and truth from the Lord is complete, the goodness and truth become the person's own, for now they flow all 
the way through to the final level of order, that is, of the natural order, which all Divine influx heads towards. The person who has the Divine flowing all the way through him may be called a road 
of heaven. From all this it may now be seen that 'coming near before Jehovah' means a state in which that influx is accepted and put to use, here a state in which the good meant by 'manna' and the delight 
meant by 'selav' are accepted. </p>

`Appropinquate coram Jehovah': quod significet statum receptionis et applicationem ad illum, constat ex significatione `appropinquare coram Jehovah' quod sit influxus, de qua n. 8159, et inde quoque 
receptio, nam receptio est reciprocum influxus, correspondent enim sibi mutuo {1}; quantum {2} homo recipit influxum Divinum, tantum dicitur appropinquare coram Ipso; {3}appropinquatio coram Jehovah 
in spirituali sensu non aliud est, nam fit appropinquatio ad Ipsum per fidem et amorem, et quia et fides et amor est a Jehovah, hoc est, Domino, est etiam appropinquatio ad Ipsum receptio boni et veri 
ab Ipso influentis; quod etiam sit applicatio, est quia receptio non est aliquid nisi etiam sit applicatio, nempe ad usum, transit enim influxus a Divino primum in perceptionem, quae est intellectus 
apud hominem, inde in voluntatem, et dein in actum, hoc est, in bonum opus, quod est usus, et ibi desinit; cum influxus boni et veri a Domino transitum hunc facit, tunc bonum et verum appropriantur homini, 
nam tunc influxus vadit usque in ultimum ordinis, hoc est, in ultimum naturae, quo tendit omnis influxus Divinus; {4}ille homo, apud quem influxus Divinus ita vadit, vocari potest via caeli; ex 
his nunc constare potest quod per `appropinquare coram Jehovah' {5}significetur status receptionis et {6}applicatio ad illum; hic status receptionis boni quod per `mannam' significatur, et jucundi quod 
per `selav.' 	@1 i, quia influxus a divino apud hominem praedicatur secundum receptionem$ 	@2 i itaque$ 	@3 inde est quod appropinquatio coram Jehovah sit$ 	@4 et ille$ 	@5 sit$ 	@6 applicationis$ </p>
