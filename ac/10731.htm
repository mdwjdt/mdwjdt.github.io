<h3 align="center" class="ired">属天的奥秘 第10731节</h3>
<h4 align="center"></h4><p><strong>10731</strong>.“凡在这日作工的，必须被处死”表对那些被自己和自己的爱引导，而不是被主引导的人来说，属灵的死亡。这从“在安息日作工”和“处死”的含义清楚可知：“在安息日作工”是指被自己和自己的爱引导，而不是被主引导（参看<a href="8495.htm">8495</a>，<a href="10360.htm">10360</a>，<a href="10362.htm">10362</a>，<a href="10364.htm">10364</a>节）；“处死”是指诅咒，或属灵的死亡（<a href="6119.htm">6119</a>，<a href="9008.htm">9008</a>节）。那些被自己和自己的爱引导的人不信主，因为信主就在于被祂，而不是被自己引导。也正因如此，这些人根本看不到祂的人身与神性本身的合一有什么价值，事实上也看不到被主重生有什么价值，从而看不到教会的真理有什么价值。因为他们对自己说，这些事有什么价值呢？我们知道它们，甚至思想、渴慕它们有什么好处呢？我们还不是和其他人一样活着？有什么分别呢？他们之所以如此思考，是因为他们出于世界的生活，而不是出于天堂的生活进行思考。天堂的生活是他们所不知道的事，没有人能出于未知的事进行思考。因此，像这样的人不可能得救，因为他们没有天堂在自己里面，因而不可能在天堂；他们的内层与天堂不一致。事实上，除非他们的内层被主重新排列，以合乎天堂的形像，否则与天堂的结合是不可能的。这就是那些否认这些共性真理之人的样子。“在安息日作工”就表示人的这种状态，而这些人的属世死亡则表示他们的属灵死亡。</p>

Everyone doing work therein shall die. That this signifies spiritual death for those who are led by themselves and their own loves, and not by the Lord, is evident from the signification of "doing works 
on the Sabbath day," as being to be led by self and one's own loves, and not by the Lord (see n. 8495, 10360, 10362, 10364); and from the signification of "dying," as being damnation, or spiritual 
death (n. 6119, 9008). Those who are led by themselves and by their own loves do not believe in the Lord, for to believe in the Lord is from Him, and not from self. From this it is also that such persons 
make of no account the union of His Human with the Divine Itself, and also of regeneration by the Lord; and thus also make of no account the truths of the church; for they say to themselves, "Of 
what value are such things?" Or, "What does it matter whether we know them? or even think them, and desire them? Are we not still alive, like other people? What difference is there?" The reason why they 
so think is that they think from the life of the world, and not from the life of heaven. The life of heaven is a thing unknown to them, and no one can think from what is unknown; and therefore such 
people cannot be saved, because they have not heaven in them, and therefore they cannot be in heaven, for their interiors are not in agreement with it. For unless these have been disposed by the Lord 
according to the image of heaven, there is no conjunction with heaven. Such are those who deny these universal truths. It is this state of man which is signified by "works done on the Sabbath day;" and 
the spiritual death of such persons is signified by their natural "death." </p>

'Everyone doing work on it shall die' means spiritual death to those who are led by self and selfish loves, and not by the Lord. This is clear from the meaning of '[doing] work on the sabbath day' as 
being led by self and selfish loves, and not by the Lord, dealt with in <a href="8495.htm">8495</a>, <a href="10360.htm">10360</a>, <a href="10362.htm">10362</a>, <a href="10364.htm">10364</a>; and from the meaning of 'dying' as damnation or spiritual death, dealt with in <a href="6119.htm">6119</a>, <a href="9008.htm">9008</a>. Those led 
by self and selfish loves do not believe in the Lord, for belief in the Lord consists in being led by Him and not by self. Nor, as a result of this, do they see any value at all in the union of His Human 
with the Divine itself, nor indeed any value at all in being regenerated by the Lord, nor thus any value in the Church's truths either. For they say to themselves, What are such things? Or, What 
advantage do we have if we know them, indeed think about them and desire them? Surely we live in the way others do, so what difference does it make? The reason why they think like this is that the life 
of the world, not the life of heaven, governs their thinking; the life of heaven is something about which they are ignorant and no one's thought can be governed by that of which he is ignorant. People 
such as these therefore cannot be saved, for they do not have heaven within them and consequently cannot be in heaven; their interiors are not in accord with it. For unless their interiors have been 
rearranged by the Lord to conform to an image of heaven there can be no joining to heaven. This is what those people are like who refuse to believe in those all-embracing realities. This condition in 
a person is what is meant by '[doing] work on the sabbath day', and the spiritual death of such is what is meant by their natural death.  </p>

`Omnis faciens in illo opus morietur': quod significet mortem spiritualem illis qui ducuntur a {1}se et suis amoribus, et non a Domino, constat ex significatione `operum die sabbati' quod sit duci a 
semet et {2} suis amoribus, et non a Domino, de qua n. 8495, 10,360, 10,362, (x)10,364, et ex significatione `mori' quod sit damnatio seu mors {3}spiritualis, de qua n. 6119, 9008.  {4}Qui ducuntur a 
semet et a suis amoribus, illi non credunt in Dominum, nam credere in Dominum est ab Ipso et non a semet; inde est quod etiam illi nihili faciant unionem Humani Ipsius cum ipso Divino, et quoque nihili 
faciunt regenerationem a Domino, et ita quoque nihili faciunt vera Ecclesiae; dicunt enim in se, Quid talia aut quid refert si sciamus illa? immo si cogitemus illa et desideremus illa, annon usque 
vivimus sicut alii, quae differentia? quod ita cogitent, est quia ex vita mundi et non ex vita caeli cogitant; vita caeli est illis ignotum quid, et nemo ex ignoto cogitare potest; quapropter qui tales 
sunt non salvari possunt, nam non caelum in se habent, ideo nec in caelo possunt esse, non (x)concordant interiora eorum, nam nisi haec ad imaginem caeli a Domino disposita fuerint, nulla cum caelo 
conjunctio est; tales sunt qui negant universalia illa; hic status hominis est qui significatur per `opera die sabbati,' (c)et mors eorum spiritualis per mortem eorum naturalem. @1 semet$ @2 i a$ @3

facere vera Ecclesiae, qui tales sunt non possunt salvari, negant enim universalia, et qui illa negant, nihil a Domino recipere possunt, omnis enim influxus Divinus apud tales illico rejicitur, vel
