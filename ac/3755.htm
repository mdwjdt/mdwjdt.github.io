<h3 align="center" class="ired">属天的奥秘 第3755节</h3>
<h4 align="center"></h4><p><strong>3755.</strong>“当那些日子，怀孩子的和奶孩子的有祸了”表示那些充满爱主的良善和纯真的良善之人。“祸”是表示永恒咒诅危险的一种表达形式；“怀孩子”表怀有天堂之爱的良善；“奶孩子”也是一种纯真的状态；“那些日子”表那时教会所经历的状态。<br />“你们要祷告，使你们的逃走不在冬天，也不在安息日”表示远离那些事，防止它在过冷或过热的状态下迅速发生。“逃走”是指远离刚才所说爱与纯真的良善的状态；“在冬天逃走”是指在过冷的状态下远离这些良善，“冷”是指对爱与纯真心怀厌恶之时，这是由各种自我之爱引发的；“在安息日逃走”是指在过热的状态下远离它们，“热”是指当自我之爱和尘世之爱在里头时的外在神圣。<br />“因为那时必有大灾难，从世界的起头直到如今，没有这样的灾难，将来也必没有”表示对教会的良善与真理最大程度的败坏和荒废，也就是亵渎。因为对神圣事物的亵渎会导致永死，这种死亡远远比任何其它邪恶状态所导致的死亡严重得多，并且严重程度与遭到亵渎的良善和真理属乎内层的程度成正比。由于这类内层良善与真理在基督教会已经披露，为人知晓，并且遭到了亵渎，故经上说：“因为那时必有大灾难，从世界的起头直到如今，没有这样的灾难，将来也必没有”。<br />“若不减少那日子，凡有血气的，总没有一个得救的；只是为选民，那日子必减少了”表示那些属于教会的人从内层良善与真理转移到外层，好让那些过着良善与真理的生活之人仍能得救。“减少那日子”表示这种转移的状态；“凡有血气的，总没有一个得救的”表示否则无人得救；“选民”表示那些过着良善与真理的生活之人。</p>

<p align="center"><b>Potts(1905-1910) 3755</b></p><p><b>3755.</b>
But woe unto them that are with child, and to them that give suck in those days; </p>
<p>signifies those who have been imbued with the good of love to the Lord and the good of innocence. "Woe" is a form of 
expression signifying the danger of eternal damnation; "to be with child" is to conceive the good of heavenly love; "to give suck" is also a state of innocence; "those days" denote the states in which 
the church then is.      [2] And pray ye that your flight be not in the winter, neither on the sabbath; </p>
<p>signifies removal from those things, that it be not done precipitately, in a state of too much 
cold or of too much heat. "Flight" is removal from a state of the good of love and of innocence, just now spoken of; "flight in the winter" is removal therefrom in a state of too much cold; "cold" is 
when there is aversion to love and innocence, which is induced by the loves of self; "flight on the sabbath" is removal from them in a state of too much heat; "heat" is external sanctity, while within 
are the love of self and the love of the world.      [3] For then shall be great affliction, such as was not since the beginning of the world even until now, neither shall be; </p>
<p>signifies the highest 
degree of the perversion and vastation of the church in respect to good and truth, which is profanation; for profanation of what is holy occasions death eternal and much more grievous than any other 
states of evil, and so much the more grievous in proportion as the goods and truths profaned are of a more interior kind; and inasmuch as such interior goods and truths are open and known in the Christian 
Church, and are profaned, it is said that "then shall be great affliction such as was not from the beginning of the world even until now, neither shall be."      [4] And except those days should 
be shortened, there should no flesh be preserved; but for the elect's sake those days shall be shortened; </p>
<p>signifies the removal of those who are of the church from interior goods and truths to exterior, 
so that those may still be saved who are in the life of good and truth; by the "days being shortened," is signified a state of removal; by "no flesh being preserved," is signified that otherwise 
none could be saved; by "the elect" are signified those who are in the life of good and truth. </p>

<p align="center"><b>Elliott(1983-1999) 3755</b></p><p><b>3755.</b>
But woe to those who are with child or giving suck in those days! means those who have been endowed with the good that flows from love to the Lord and with the good that goes with innocence. 'Woe!' is 
an expression meaning the danger of eternal condemnation. 'Being with child' means conceiving good that stems from heavenly love. 'Giving suck' is also a state of innocence, 'those days' the state which 
the Church is passing through at that time. </p>
<p></p>
<p><b>[2]</b>
 Pray that your flight may not be in winter or on a sabbath means removal from those things to prevent it happening rapidly during a state of excessive 
cold or a state of excessive heat. 'Flight' is removal from a state of good stemming from love and from innocence, dealt with just above. 'Flight in winter' is a removal from these during a state 
of excessive cold - cold being a time when there is an aversion to those things, which is caused by all kinds of self- love. 'Flight on a sabbath' is removal from them during a state of excessive heat 
- heat being external holiness when self-love and love of the world exist inwardly. </p>
<p></p>
<p><b>[3]</b>
 For then there will be great affliction, unlike any from the beginning of the world until now, or any in 
the future means the furthest degree of the perversion and vastation of the good and truth of the Church, which is profanation. For the profanation of that which is holy leads to eternal death, a death 
far more serious than that to which any other states of evil lead, and which is all the more serious insofar as they are interior goods and truths which are made profane. And since they are interior 
goods and truths that have been disclosed and made known in the Christian Church and have then been made profane it is said that 'then there will be great affliction, unlike any from the beginning of 
the world until now, or any in the future'. </p>
<p></p>
<p><b>[4]</b>
 And unless those days were cut short, no flesh would be saved; but for the sake of the elect those days will be cut short means the removal of those 
who belong to the Church from interior goods and truths to exterior in order that those who lead lives that are good and true may nevertheless be saved. 'Cutting days short' means a state of such removal; 
'no flesh being saved' means that otherwise nobody could be saved; 'the elect' means those who lead lives that are good and true. </p>

</p><b>3755.</b>
`Vae autem in utero gerentibus {1}et lactantibus in diebus illis' significat illos qui imbuti sunt bono amoris in Dominum et bono innocentiae; `vae' est formula significans periculum damnationis 
aeternae; `in utero gerere' est concipere bonum amoris caelestis{2}; `lactare' est quoque innocentiae statum; `dies illi' sunt status in quibus tunc Ecclesia{3}, [2] `Orate vero ne fiat fuga vestra 
hieme, neque in sabbato' significat remotionem ab illis, ne hoc praecipitanter fiat in statu nimii frigoris, et in statu nimii aestus; `fuga' est remotio a statu boni amoris et innocentiae, de quibus 
mox supra; `fuga in hieme' est remotio ab illis in statu nimii frigoris, frigus est quando aversatio pro illis, quae inducitur per amores sui; `fuga in sabbato' est remotio ab illis in statu nimii 
aestus; `aestus' est sanctum externum, cum intus amor sui et mundi. [3] `Erit enim tunc afflictio magna, qualis non fuit ab initio mundi usque nunc, nec fiet' significat summum gradum perversionis 
ac vastationis Ecclesiae quoad bonum et verum, qui est profanatio; profanatio enim sancti inducit mortem aeternam et multo graviorem quam reliqui status mali, et eo graviorem quo interiora bona 
et vera sunt quae profanantur, quae interiora quia aperta sunt et nota in Ecclesia Christiana, et illa profanata, dicitur quod `tunc erit afflictio magna, qualis non fuit ab initio mundi usque nunc, 
nec fiet.' [4] `Et nisi contraherentur dies isti, non conservaretur ulla caro; sed propter electos contrahentur dies illi' significant remotionem illorum qui ab Ecclesia, ab interioribus bonis et 
veris ad exteriora, ut usque salvari possint illi qui in vita boni (c)et veri sunt; per `contrahi dies' significatur status remotionis, per `non conservari ulla caro' significatur quod alioquin nemo 
salvari posset; per `electos' significantur illi qui in vita boni et veri sunt. @1 3751 and 3753 have aut$ @2 i et quoque imbuere illud$ @3 i est$ </p>
