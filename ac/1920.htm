<h3 align="center" class="ired">属天的奥秘 第1920节</h3>
<h4 align="center"></h4><p><strong>1920.</strong>“看哪，你的婢女在你手中”表所孕育的理性在与良善联结的真理的掌控之内。这从“手”和“埃及人夏甲”的含义清楚可知：前面说明，“手”表力量（<a href="878.htm">878</a>节），“埃及人夏甲”表对记忆知识的情感。理性通过内在人进入外层人中对记忆知识情感生命的流注而孕育后，“婢女”就用来表示在子宫里的柔嫩理性，但这理性生出并发展后，就由下文所论述的以实玛利来代表。主对自己里面的理性具有至高无上的掌控力，祂凭自己的力量征服它，这从接下来的论述可以看出来。</p>

Behold thy handmaid is in thy hand. That this signifies that the rational that was conceived was in the power of the affection of truth that is adjoined to good, is evident from the signification of 
the "hand," as being power (explained before, n. 878); and from the signification of "Hagar the Egyptian," as being the affection of memory-knowledges (also spoken of above). After the rational had been 
conceived by the influx of the internal man into the life of the affection of memory-knowledges of the exterior man, then by the "handmaid" is also meant that tender rational which was in the womb, 
but which when born and grown, is represented by Ishmael, who is treated of in what follows. That the Lord had sovereign control over the rational that was in Him, and that He subjugated it by His own 
power, will be seen from what will be said presently. </p>

<p align="center"><b>Elliott(1983-1999) 1920</b></p><p><b>1920.</b>
'Behold, your servant-girl is in your hand' means that this rational was conceived from the controlling power of the affection for truth allied to good. This is clear from the meaning of 'hand' as power, 
dealt with already in <a href="878.htm">878</a>, and from the meaning of 'Hagar the Egyptian' as the affection for knowledge, also dealt with already. Following the conception of the rational by means of the internal 
man flowing into the life belonging to the exterior affection for knowledge, 'servant-girl' is used to mean that tender embryonic rational which however is represented, when born and developed, by Ishmael, 
who is the subject below. That the Lord had control over the rational residing with Him and that He subdued it by His own power will be clear from what is to be stated next. </p>

`Ecce ancilla tua in manu tua': quod significet rationale  hoc conceptum esse sub potestate affectionis veri adjuncti bono, constat a significatione `manus' quod sit potestas, de qua prius   n. 878, 
et ex significatione `{1}Hagaris Aegyptiae' quod sit affectio scientiarum, de qua etiam prius: postquam rationale per influxum interni hominis in vitam affectionis scientiarum exterioris conceptum {2}est, 
tunc per `ancillam' etiam intelligitur tenerum illud rationale, quod in utero, quod autem cum natum est et adolevit, repraesentatur per `Ismaelem,' de quo in sequentibus. Quod Domino fuerit potestas 
in rationale quod apud Ipsum, et quod ex propria potentia subjugaverit illud, constabit {3}ex mox dicendis. @1 i ancillae$ @2 sit$ @3 quoque ex nunc$ </p>
