<h3 align="center" class="ired">属天的奥秘 第9918节</h3>
<h4 align="center"></h4><p><strong>9918.</strong>“石榴”表关于良善的记忆知识。这从“石榴”的含义清楚可知，“石榴”是指关于良善的记忆知识（参看<a href="9552.htm">9552</a>节）。石榴之所以安在外袍的底边上，是因为“底边”表示天堂和教会的最后和最低，或最外在的事物，那里的最后或最外在的事物就是记忆知识，这一点从前面（<a href="9915.htm">9915</a>，<a href="9917.htm">9917</a>节）关于在天堂里并与个体人同在的良善与真理的层级彼此跟随的次序的说明清楚看出来。“石榴”所表示的关于良善和真理的记忆知识由取自圣言的教义事物构成；这些教义事物作为记忆知识而存在，并且到了这种程度：它们就存在于居于外在人或属世人中的记忆里面。但当它们进入居于内在人或属灵人中的记忆里时，如当一个人照它们生活时的情形，与真理有关的教义事物就会变成信之事物，与良善有关的教义事物仁之事物，被称为属灵的。当这种情况发生时，它们几乎从外部或属世记忆中消失，仿佛成为本能，因为它们已被植入人的生命，就像所有通过频繁练习、使用而变成第二天性的事物一样。由此明显可知何为记忆知识，它有什么用处；因而教会的教义事物只要唯独存于记忆中，又有什么用处。因为当它们只存于记忆中时，它们就占据聪明和智慧之下的位置，而不是上升或进入生命，除非它们成为内在人中的信和仁的事。</p>

Pomegranates. That hereby are signified memory-knowledges of good, is evident from the signification of "pomegranates," as being the memory-knowledges of good (see n. 9552). That pomegranates were put 
upon the skirts of the robe, was because "the skirts" signified the ultimates or extremes of heaven and the church, and the ultimates or extremes of the church are memory-knowledges, as is evident from 
what was said above (n. 9915, 9917), about the successive order of goods and truths in the heavens and with man. The memory-knowledges of good and truth which are signified by "the pomegranates," 
are doctrinal things from the Word, which are memory-knowledges insofar as they are in the memory which is in the external or natural man. But when they enter into the memory which is in the internal 
or spiritual man, as is the case when the man lives according to them, then doctrinal things as to truth become of faith, and doctrinal things as to good become of charity, and are called spiritual. When 
this is done, they almost vanish out of the external or natural memory, and appear as it were innate, because they are then implanted in the man's life, like all those things which through daily use 
have become as it were of his nature. From this it is evident what memory-knowledges are, and what purpose they serve; consequently what purpose the doctrinal things of the church serve so long as 
they are kept solely in the memory; for so long as they are kept in the memory only, they have a place beneath intelligence and wisdom; and they do not ascend, or enter into the life, until they become 
of faith and charity in the internal man. </p>

'Pomegranates' means factual knowledge of good. This is clear from the meaning of 'pomegranates' as factual knowledge of good, dealt with in <a href="9552.htm">9552</a>. The reason why pomegranates were placed on the hem of 
the robe was that 'the hem' meant the last and lowest or most external things of heaven and the Church, and the last or most external things there consist in factual knowledge, as is clear from what 
has been stated above, in <a href="9915.htm">9915</a>, <a href="9917.htm">9917</a>, about the order in which degrees of good and truth follow one another in heaven and with the individual human being. Factual knowledge of good and truth, which is 
meant by 'pomegranates', consists of matters of doctrine drawn from the Word; these matters of doctrine exist as factual knowledge to the extent that they are present in the memory which resides in 
the external or natural man. But when they pass into the memory which resides in the internal or spiritual man, which happens when a person's life is led in accord with them, the matters of doctrine that 
have to do with truth become matters of faith, and those that have to do with good become impulses of charity, and are called spiritual. When this happens they virtually disappear from the external 
or natural memory and seem to be as though instinctive, because they have been implanted in the person's life, just as anything through frequent practice becomes second nature. From all this it is evident 
what factual knowledge is and what use it serves, consequently what use matters of doctrine serve so long as they are retained merely as items of knowledge. For when they are retained merely as 
items of knowledge they occupy a position underneath intelligence and wisdom and do not rise up or pass into life until they become matters of faith and charity in the internal man.  </p>

`Malogranata': quod significet scientifica boni, constat ex significatione `malogranatorum' quod sint scientifica boni, de qua n. 9552; quod malogranata in fimbriis pallii' posita fuerint, erat causa 
quia (x)`fimbriae' significabant ultima seu extrema caeli et Ecclesiae, et ultima seu extrema ibi sunt scientifica, ut constat ex illis quae de successivo ordine bonorum et verorum in caelis et apud 
hominem, supra n. 9915 et 9917 dicta sunt. Scientifica boni et veri, quae per `malogranata' significantur, sunt doctrinalia ex Verbo; quae scientifica sunt, quatenus in memoria, quae est in externo seu 
naturali homine; quando autem intrant memoriam quae est in interno seu spirituali homine, quod fit cum vivitur secundum illa, tunc doctrinalia {1}quoad verum fiunt fidei, et {2}quoad bonum fiunt charitatis, 
ac vocantur spiritualia; cum hoc fit, evanescunt paene e memoria externa seu naturali, et apparent sicut innata, quia insita {3}vitae hominis; quemadmodum omnia quae per diutinum usum traxerunt 
quasi naturam Inde patet quid scientifica et ad quid conducunt, proinde ad quid doctrinalia Ecclesiae, dum modo scientifice tenentur; cum enim modo scientifice tenentur, tunc infra intelligentiam 
et sapientiam locum habent, nec ascendunt seu intrant vitam priusquam fiunt fidei et charitatis in interno homine. @1 veri$ @2 doctrinalia boni$ @3 ipsi vitae$ </p>
