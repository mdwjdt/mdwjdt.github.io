<h3 align="center" class="ired">属天的奥秘 第5663节</h3>
<h4 align="center"></h4><p><strong>5663.</strong>“是你们的神和你们父亲的神”表主的神性人身。这从以下事实清楚可知：在圣言中，凡提到“神”或“耶和华”的地方，所指的是主，而非其他任何人（参看<a href="1343.htm">1343</a>，<a href="1736.htm">1736</a>，<a href="2921.htm">2921</a>，<a href="3035.htm">3035</a>节）；当经上说“你们的神和你们父亲的神”，也就是以色列，雅各和他儿子们的神时，它表示主的神性人身，尤表祂的神性属世层（<a href="3305.htm">3305</a>，<a href="4286.htm">4286</a>，<a href="4570.htm">4570</a>节）；因为“以色列”代表主的内层属世层，“雅各”代表主的外层属世层，“他的儿子们”代表存在于这属世层中的真理。<br />在圣言中，“神”和“耶和华”是指主；这一真理犹太教会不知道，当今的基督教会也不知道。基督教会之所以表示不知道，是因为它将神性分成了三个独立位格。但大洪水后的古教会，尤其大洪水前的上古教会，并不将“耶和华”和“神”理解为其他任何人，只理解为主，尤其理解为祂的神性人身。他们也知道住在主里面、主称之为祂的父的神性本身；然而，他们无法思想住在主里面的神性本身，只能思想祂的神性人身，因而无法与任何其他神性联结。因为这种联结通过思维，即理解力的活动，和情感，即意愿的活动，因而通过信和爱实现。当人思想神性本身时，他的思维可以说会迷失于无边无际的空间，从而消散。因此，联结不会产生。但是，当人思想作为神性人身的神性本身时，情况就不同了。古人还知道，他们若不与神性联结，就无法得救。<br />因此，古代的教会敬拜神性人身；耶和华也以神性人身向他们显现。神性人身就是天堂里的神性本身；因为天堂构成一个人，被称为大人，如此前各章末尾所示。在天堂，这神性本质上就是神性本身；但祂作为一个神性人存在于天堂中。这“人”就是主所取，使之在自己里面变成神性并与神性本身合而为一，正如祂自永恒就使之与祂合而为一的；因为祂自永恒就是一。祂之所以如此行，是因为舍此途人类无法得救。事实上，通过天堂，因而通过那里的神性人身本身，神性本身已不足以流入人类的心智；所以神性本身愿意通过祂在世上实际所取的人身，将神性人身与祂自己合而为一。这神性人身和神性本身就是主。</p>

Your God, and the God of your father. That this signifies the Lord's Divine Human may be seen from the fact that where "God" or "Jehovah" is mentioned in the Word, the Lord and no one else is meant (see 
n. 1343, 1736, 2921, 3035); and when it is said "your God and the God of your father" that is, the God of Israel and of Jacob and his sons, it means the Lord's Divine Human, and indeed as to the Divine 
natural (n. 3305, 4286, 4570); for Israel represented the Lord as to the interior natural, Jacob as to the exterior, and his sons as to the truths in this natural. [2] That the Lord was meant in 
the Word by "God" and "Jehovah" the Jewish Church did not know, nor does the Christian Church know it at this day. That the Christian Church has not known it is because it has distinguished the Divinity 
into three persons. But the Ancient Church which was after the flood, and above all the Most Ancient Church which was before the flood, understood by "Jehovah" and "God" no other than the Lord, and 
Him indeed as to His Divine Human. They also knew about the Divine Itself which is in the Lord, and which He calls His "Father" yet they were not able to think about that Divine Itself which is in 
the Lord, but about the Divine Human, and consequently could not be conjoined with any other Divine; for conjunction is effected through thought which is of the understanding and affection which is of 
the will, thus through faith and through love. For if we think of the Divine Itself, the thought falls as it were into a boundless universe, and thus is dissipated, whence there is no conjunction. It 
is otherwise when the Divine Itself is thought of as the Divine Human. And the ancients knew that they could not be saved unless they were conjoined with the Divine. [3] Therefore it was the Divine 
Human that the Ancient Churches worshiped; and Jehovah also manifested Himself to them in the Divine Human. The Divine Human was the Divine Itself in heaven; for heaven constitutes one man, which is called 
the Grand Man, as has been heretofore shown at the end of the chapters. This Divine in heaven is none other than the Divine Itself, but in heaven it is as a Divine Man. This Man is what the Lord 
took on and made Divine in Him, and united it to the Divine Itself as it had been united from eternity; for from eternity there was a one. He did this because mankind could not otherwise have been saved; 
for it was no longer sufficient for the Divine Itself to be able, through heaven and thus through the Divine Human Itself there, to flow into human minds; wherefore the Divine Itself willed to unite 
the Divine Human to Itself actually by the Human taken on in the world. The one and the other is the Lord. </p>

'Your God and the God of your father' means the Lord's Divine Human. This becomes clear from the fact that where the name God or the name Jehovah is used in the Word, the Lord and no one else is meant, <a href="1343.htm">1343</a>, <a href="1736.htm">1736</a>, <a href="2921.htm">2921</a>, <a href="3035.htm">3035</a>. And when the words 'your God and the God of your father' are used - that is, the God of Israel and Jacob and of his sons - the Lord's Divine Human is meant, in particular His 
Divine Natural, <a href="3305.htm">3305</a>, <a href="4286.htm">4286</a>, <a href="4570.htm">4570</a>; for 'Israel' represented the Lord's interior Natural, 'Jacob' His exterior Natural, and 'his sons' the truths present in that Natural. </p>
<p></p>
<p><b>[2]</b>
 The truth that the Lord 
was meant by God and Jehovah in the Word was unknown to the Jewish Church; and the Christian Church at the present day does not know it, the reason for its ignorance of this truth being that it has 
distinguished the Divine into three separate persons. But the Ancient Church which existed after the Flood, and especially the Most Ancient Church which existed before the Flood, did not understand by 
Jehovah and God anyone else than the Lord, in particular His Divine Human. They did know about the Divine Himself who dwells within the Lord, and whom the Lord calls His Father; but they could not engage 
in any thought about the Divine Himself who dwells within the Lord, only about His Divine Human, and consequently could not be joined to any other that is Divine. For that linking together is effected 
through thought which is the activity of the understanding and through affection which is the activity of the will, thus through faith and love. When anyone thinks about the Divine Himself his thought 
becomes lost so to speak in boundless space and so is dissipated. As a consequence no joining together can result. But it is different when anyone thinks about the Divine Himself as the Divine 
Human. Those people living in former times also knew that unless they were joined to the Divine they could not be saved. </p>
<p></p>
<p><b>[3]</b>
 It was therefore a Divine Human that the Ancient Churches worshipped, and 
it was Jehovah in this Divine Human that revealed Himself among them. That Divine Human was also the Divine Himself in heaven, for heaven consists of a single human being called the Grand Man, dealt 
with at the ends of chapters up to this point. The Divine in heaven is essentially the Divine Himself; but He exists in heaven as a Divine Man. This Man is the one the Lord took upon Himself, made Divine 
within Himself, and made one with the Divine Himself, even as He had from eternity been made one with Him; for He has from eternity been one. He acted in that way because the human race could not 
otherwise be saved. The channel formed by heaven, and so by the Divine Human there, by means of which the Divine Himself came into people's minds was no longer adequate; therefore the Divine Himself 
was willing to make the Divine Human one with Himself through the Human He actually took upon Himself in the world. This Divine Human and that Divine Himself are the Lord. </p>

`Deus vester et Deus patris vestri': quod significet Divinum Humanum Domini, constare potest ex eo quod ubi in Verbo Deus aut Jehovah nominatur, intelligatur Dominus et non alius, n. 1343, 1736, 2921, 
3035; et cum dicitur `Deus vester et Deus patris vestri', hoc est, Deus Israelis et Jacobi et filiorum ejus, intelligitur Divinum Humanum Domini, et quidem quoad Divinum Naturale, n. 3305, 4286, 4570, 
nam `Israel' repraesentabat Dominum quoad Naturale interius, et `Jacob' quoad exterius, et `filii' quoad vera in illo Naturali.  [2]Quod per Deum et Jehovam in Verbo intellectus sit Dominus, Ecclesia 
Judaica non noverat nec Ecclesia Christiana hodie {1}novit; quod Ecclesia Christiana hoc non noverit, est quia Divinum in tres personas distinxit; at (t)Antiqua Ecclesia quae fuit post diluvium, et 
imprimis Ecclesia Antiquissima quae fuit ante diluvium, non alium per Jehovam et Deum intellexerunt quam Dominum, et quidem Ipsum quoad Divinum Humanum; noverunt etiam de Ipso Divino quod in Domino, 
et quod Ipse vocat Patrem Suum, at de Ipso illo Divino quod in Domino, non cogitare potuerunt, sed de Divino Humano, consequenter non alii Divino conjungi; conjunctio enim fit per cogitationem quae intellectus, 
et per {2}affectionem quae voluntatis, ita per fidem et per amorem; (m)cum enim cogitatur de Ipso Divino, cadit cogitatio sicut in universum interminatum et sic dissipatur, unde nulla conjunctio; 
aliter cum cogitatur de Ipso Divino ut Divinum Humanum ;(n) et noverunt quod nisi cum Divino conjungerentur, non salvari possent; [3]idcirco fuit Divinum Humanum quod Antiquae Ecclesiae adoraverunt, 
Jehovah etiam in Divino Humano se manifestavit apud illos; et Divinum Humanum fuit Ipsum Divinum in caelo, caelum enim constituit unum hominem qui Maximus Homo vocatur, de quo ad finem capitum 
hactenus (x)est actum; Divinum hoc in caelo, non aliud est quam Ipsum Divinum, sed in caelo ut Divinus Homo; hic Homo est quem Dominus suscepit, et in Se Divinum fecit, et univit Ipsi Divino sicut ab 
aeterno unitus fuerat, nam ab aeterno fuit unum; et hoc quia genus humanum aliter non salvari potuisset; non enim amplius sufficere potuit ut Ipsum Divinum per caelum, ita per Divinum Humanum (x)ibi, 
influere posset in mentes humanas, quapropter Ipsum Divinum voluit Divinum Humanum actualiter per susceptum Humanum in mundo, sibi unire; hoc et illud est Dominus. @1 , at Ecclesia Christiana non ideo
