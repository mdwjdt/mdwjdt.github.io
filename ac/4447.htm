<h3 align="center" class="ired">属天的奥秘 第4447节</h3>
<h4 align="center"></h4><p><strong>4447.</strong>“哈抹和他们谈话，说”表古人当中的教会之良善。这从“哈抹”的代表清楚可知，“哈抹”是指从古人那里所得来的东西（参看<a href="4431.htm">4431</a>节），也就是从他们那里所得来的教义良善。因为教会的良善是父亲，源于这良善的真理（在此由“示剑”来表示）是儿子；这也是为何在圣言中，“父亲”表示良善，“儿子”表示真理。在此之所以说“古人当中的教会之良善”，而不说“古教会的良善”，是因为“古人当中的教会”是指源于存在于大洪水之前的上古教会的教会，“古教会”是指存在于大洪水之后的教会。在此之前，我们曾数次阐述过这两个教会，并说明大洪水前的上古教会是属天的，而大洪水后的古教会是属灵的，还频繁论述过这二者之间的区别。<br />属天的上古教会的余留仍存在于迦南地，尤其存在于那些被称为赫人和希未人的人中间。这些余留之所以在其它地方不存在，是因为被称“人”或“亚当”（<a href="478.htm">478</a>，<a href="479.htm">479</a>节）的上古教会就在迦南地，因此“伊甸园”也在那地；“伊甸园”表示该教会之人的聪明（<a href="100.htm">100</a>，<a href="1588.htm">1588</a>节），园中的树则表示他们的觉知（<a href="103.htm">103</a>，<a href="2163.htm">2163</a>，<a href="2722.htm">2722</a>，<a href="2972.htm">2972</a>节）。这个园子或乐园因表示聪明和智慧，故表示教会本身；并且因表示教会，故也表示天堂；因表示天堂，故在至高意义上还表示主。因此，“迦南地”本身在至高意义上也表示主；在相对意义上表示天堂，以及教会；在个体意义上表示教会成员（<a href="1413.htm">1413</a>，<a href="1437.htm">1437</a>，<a href="1607.htm">1607</a>，<a href="3038.htm">3038</a>，<a href="3481.htm">3481</a>，<a href="3705.htm">3705</a>节）。因此，“陆地”或“地”这个词在圣言中单独被提及时，也具有同样的含义（<a href="566.htm">566</a>，<a href="662.htm">662</a>，<a href="1066.htm">1066</a>，<a href="1067.htm">1067</a>，<a href="1413.htm">1413</a>，<a href="1607.htm">1607</a>，<a href="3355.htm">3355</a>节）；而“新天和新地”就表示一个新教会，无论内在还是外在（<a href="1733.htm">1733</a>，<a href="1850.htm">1850</a>，<a href="2117.htm">2117</a>，<a href="2118.htm">2118</a>e，<a href="3355.htm">3355</a>e节）。上古教会就在迦南地（参看<a href="567.htm">567</a>节），正因如此，那里的地方成了代表。这解释了为何亚伯兰被吩咐去往那里，以及为何那地被赐给他的后代，也就是雅各的儿子们，即为了这些地方的代表能够永久保存下来，这些地方在写圣言时都会用得到（参看<a href="3686.htm">3686</a>节）。这就是为何那地的每个地方，包括山川河流，以及四围的所有边界都成了代表（<a href="1585.htm">1585</a>，<a href="1866.htm">1866</a>，<a href="4240.htm">4240</a>节）。<br />这一切表明此处“古人当中的教会”是什么意思，即是指上古教会的余留。因为这些余留存在于赫人和希未人中间，故亚伯拉罕、以撒、和雅各，连同他们的妻子，都在赫人中间、在他们的地上得了一块坟地（创世记<a href="http://39-27.cn/创23.1.htm">23:1</a>-<a href="http://39-27.cn/创23.20.htm">20</a>；<a href="http://39-27.cn/创49.29.htm">49:29</a>-<a href="http://39-27.cn/创49.32.htm">32</a>；<a href="http://39-27.cn/创50.13.htm">50:13</a>）；约瑟也在希未人中间（约书亚记<a href="http://39-27.cn/书24.32.htm">24:32</a>）。示剑的父亲哈抹代表该教会的余留，因此他表示古人当中的教会之良善，因而表示来自神性支系的内层真理的起源（<a href="4399.htm">4399</a>节）。至于大洪水前的上古教会和大洪水后的古教会之间有何区别，可参看前文（<a href="597.htm">597</a>，<a href="607.htm">607</a>，<a href="608.htm">608</a>，<a href="640.htm">640</a>，<a href="641.htm">641</a>，<a href="765.htm">765</a>，<a href="784.htm">784</a>，<a href="895.htm">895</a>，<a href="920.htm">920</a>，<a href="1114.htm">1114</a>-<a href="1128.htm">1128</a>，<a href="1238.htm">1238</a>，<a href="1327.htm">1327</a>，<a href="2896.htm">2896</a>，<a href="2897.htm">2897</a>节）。</p>

And Hamor spoke with them, saying. That this signifies the good of the Church among the Ancients, is evident from the representation of Hamor, as being what is from the ancients (see n. 4431), that is, 
the good of the church which was among them. For the good of the church is father, and the derivative truth ("Shechem") is son; and therefore by "father" in the Word is signified good, and by "son" 
truth. It is here said "the good of the Church among the Ancients," but not "the good of the Ancient Church," for the reason that by the "Church among the Ancients" is meant the church that was derived 
from the Most Ancient Church which existed before the flood, and by the "Ancient Church" is meant the church that existed after the flood. These two churches have sometimes been treated of in the preceding 
pages, and it has been shown that the Most Ancient Church which was before the flood was celestial, but the Ancient Church which was after the flood was spiritual, and the difference between 
them has often been treated of.  [2] The remains of the Most Ancient Church which was celestial still existed in the land of Canaan, especially among those called Hittites and Hivites. The reason why 
these remains did not exist anywhere else was that the Most Ancient Church called "Man" or "Adam" (n. 478, 479) was in the land of Canaan, and therefore the "garden of Eden," by which was signified the 
intelligence and wisdom of the men of that church (n. 100, 1588), and by the trees in it their perception, (n. 103, 2163, 2722, 2972), was in that land. And because intelligence and wisdom were signified 
by this "garden" or paradise, the church itself was meant by it; and because the church was meant, so also was heaven; and because heaven, so also in the supreme sense, was the Lord; and therefore 
in this sense the "land of Canaan" itself signifies the Lord, in the relative sense heaven and also the church, and in the individual sense the man of the church (n. 1413, 1437, 1607, 3038, 3481, 
3705); and therefore also the term "land" or "earth" when mentioned alone in the Word has a like signification (n. 566, 662, 1066, 1067, 1413, 1607, 3355); the "new heaven and new earth" being a new church 
in respect to its internal and its external (n. 1733, 1850, 2117, 2118, 3355). That the Most Ancient Church was in the land of Canaan may be seen in n. 567; and the result of this was that the places 
there became representative, and for this reason Abram was commanded to go there, and the land was given to his descendants the sons of Jacob in order that the representatives of the places in accordance 
with which the Word was to be written, might be retained. (See n. 3686; and that for the same reason all the places there, as well as the mountains and rivers, and all the borders round about, 
became representative, n. 1585, 1866, 4240.) [3] All this shows what is here meant by the "Church among the Ancients," namely, remains from the Most Ancient Church. And as these remains existed among 
the Hittites and Hivites, therefore Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob, together with their wives, obtained a place of burial with the Hittites in their land (Gen. 23:1-20; 49:29-32; 50:13); and Joseph with 
the Hivites (Josh. 24:32). Hamor the father of Shechem represented the remains of this Church, and therefore by him is signified the good of the Church among the Ancients, and consequently the origin 
of interior truth from a Divine stock (n. 4399). (What the distinction is between the Most Ancient Church which was before the flood, and the Ancient Church which was after the flood, may be seen above, 
n. 597, 607, 608, 640, 641, 765, 784, 895, 920, 1114-1128, 1238, 1327, 2896, 2897.) </p>

<p align="center"><b>Elliott(1983-1999) 4447</b></p><p><b>4447.</b>
'Hamor spoke to them, saying' means the good of the Church among the Ancients. This is clear from the representation of 'Hamor' as that which was received from the Ancients, dealt with in <a href="4431.htm">4431</a>, namely 
the good of the Church received from them, for the good of the Church is 'a father', and the truth derived from that good, meant here by 'Shechem', is 'a son' - which also is why 'father' in the Word 
means good, and 'son' truth. The expression 'the good of the Church among the Ancients' is used here, not the good of the Ancient Church, for the reason that the phrase 'the Church among the Ancients' 
is used to mean the Church that descended from the Most Ancient Church which existed before the Flood, whereas the Ancient Church is used to mean the Church which came into existence after the Flood. 
Those two Churches have been dealt with several times previous to this, when it has been shown that the Most Ancient Church which existed before the Flood was celestial whereas the Ancient Church which 
came into existence after the Flood was spiritual. The difference between the two has also been dealt with often. </p>
<p></p>
<p><b>[2]</b>
 Remnants of the Most Ancient Church which was celestial were still in existence 
in the land of Canaan, especially among those in that land who were called Hittites and Hivites. The reason why such remnants did not exist anywhere else was that the Most Ancient Church, which 
was called Man or Adam, <a href="478.htm">478</a>, <a href="479.htm">479</a>, existed in the land of Canaan, where the garden of Eden, which meant the intelligence and wisdom of the members of that Church, <a href="100.htm">100</a>, <a href="1588.htm">1588</a>, and the trees in it their perception, <a href="103.htm">103</a>, <a href="2163.htm">2163</a>, <a href="2722.htm">2722</a>, <a href="2972.htm">2972</a>, was therefore situated. And because intelligence and wisdom were meant by that garden or paradise the Church itself is also meant by it. And because the Church is meant, 
so also is heaven; and because heaven is meant, so also in the highest sense is the Lord. So it is that in the highest sense the land of Canaan also means the Lord, in the relative sense heaven and 
also the Church, and in the personal sense the member of the Church, <a href="1413.htm">1413</a>, <a href="1437.htm">1437</a>, <a href="1607.htm">1607</a>, <a href="3038.htm">3038</a>, <a href="3481.htm">3481</a>, <a href="3705.htm">3705</a>. So it is too that the word 'land' standing by itself in the Word has a similar meaning, <a href="566.htm">566</a>, 
<a href="662.htm">662</a>, <a href="1066.htm">1066</a>, <a href="1067.htm">1067</a>, <a href="1413.htm">1413</a>, <a href="1607.htm">1607</a>, <a href="3355.htm">3355</a>; while a new heaven and a new earth mean a new Church, internally and externally, <a href="1733.htm">1733</a>, <a href="1850.htm">1850</a>, <a href="2117.htm">2117</a>, <a href="2118.htm">2118</a> (end), <a href="3355.htm">3355</a> (end). The Most Ancient Church was situated in the 
land of Canaan, see <a href="567.htm">567</a>, and it was from this that places there became representative. It explains why Abram was commanded to go there, and also why the land was given to his descendants from Jacob, 
namely that the representatives connected with the places which were to be used in the composition of the Word might be perpetuated, <a href="3686.htm">3686</a>. This was why every place in that land, including mountains and 
rivers, and also all the borders surrounding it, became representative, <a href="1585.htm">1585</a>, <a href="1866.htm">1866</a>, <a href="4240.htm">4240</a>. </p>
<p></p>
<p><b>[3]</b>
 From all these considerations one may see what the expression 'Church among the Ancients' is used to 
mean, namely remnants of the Most Ancient Church. And because those remnants existed among the Hittites and Hivites, Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob, with their wives, acquired a burial-place among the Hittites 
in their land, <a href="http://bible.gospelcom.net/cgi-bin/bible?passage=Gen%2023:1-end;%2049:29-32;%2050:13&amp;version=ESV&amp;interface=print&amp;showfn=yes&amp;showxref">Gen 23:1-end; 49:29-32; 50:13</a>; and Joseph among the Hivites, <a href="http://bible.gospelcom.net/cgi-bin/bible?passage=Josh%2024:32&amp;version=ESV&amp;interface=print&amp;showfn=yes&amp;showxref">Josh 24:32</a>. Hamor, Shechem's father, represented the remnants of that Church, and as a consequence means the good of 
the Church among the Ancients and therefore the origin of interior truth from a Divine stock, <a href="4399.htm">4399</a>. What the difference is between the Most Ancient Church which existed before the Flood and the Ancient 
Church which came into existence after the Flood, see <a href="597.htm">597</a>, <a href="607.htm">607</a>, <a href="608.htm">608</a>, <a href="640.htm">640</a>, <a href="641.htm">641</a>, <a href="765.htm">765</a>, <a href="784.htm">784</a>, <a href="895.htm">895</a>, <a href="920.htm">920</a>, <a href="1114.htm">1114</a>-<a href="1128.htm">1128</a>, <a href="1238.htm">1238</a>, <a href="1327.htm">1327</a>, <a href="2896.htm">2896</a>, <a href="2897.htm">2897</a>. </p>

Locutus Hamor cum illis dicendo': quod significet bonum Ecclesiae apud antiquos, constat a repraesentatione Hamoris, quod {1} sit ab antiquis, de qua n. 4431, nempe bonum Ecclesiae ab illis, nam 
bonum Ecclesiae est `pater,' et verum inde, quod hic {2} Shechemus, est `filius,' inde etiam (t)per `patrem' in Verbo' significatur bonum, et per `filium' verum.  Hic dicitur bonum Ecclesiae apud antiquos, 
non autem bonum Ecclesiae Antiquae, hoc ob causam quia per Ecclesiam apud antiquos {3} intelligitur Ecclesia derivata ab Ecclesia Antiquissima quae luit ante diluvium, et per Ecclesiam Antiquam 
intelligitur Ecclesia quae post diluvium; de binis illis Ecclesiis in praecedentibus aliquoties actum est, et ostensum quod Antiquissima Ecclesia quae ante diluvium, fuerit caelestis, sed Antiqua 
Ecclesia quae post diluvium, fuerit spiritualis; de differentia utriusque etiam saepe actum est: [2] reliquiae Antiquissimae Ecclesiae quae caelestis, fuerunt adhuc in terra Canaane, et ibi cumprimis 
apud illos qui (t)Hittaei et Hivaei vocabantur: quod non alibi, erat quia Antiquissima Ecclesia, quae vocata est Homo seu Adam, n. 478, 479, in terra Canaane fuit, proinde ibi hortus Edenis,

hortum seu paradisum illum significata est, etiam ipsa Ecclesia per illum intelligitur, et quia Ecclesia, etiam caelum, et quia caelum, etiam in supremo sensu Dominus {4}; inde est quod terra Canaan 
quoque significet in supremo sensu Dominum {5}, in sensu respectivo caelum, et quoque Ecclesiam, et in sensu singulari hominem Ecclesiae, n. 1413, 1437, 1607, 3038, 3481, 3705; et quoque inde {6} 
est quod `terra' simpliciter nominata in Verbo simile significet, n. 566, 662, 1066, 1067, 1413, 1607, 3355; et quod novum caelum et nova terra sit Ecclesia nova quoad internum et externum ejus, 
n. 1733, 1850, 2117, 2118 f., 3355 f.  Quod Antiquissima Ecclesia fuerit in terra Canaan, videatur n. 567; et quod inde oriunda sint repraesentativa locorum, et quod ideo Abram (x)jussus sit illuc 
ire, tum {7} quod terra illa data sit posteris illius ex Jacobo, ut nempe repraesentativa (o)locorum retinerentur, secundum quae Verbum conscriberetur, n. 3686; quodque {8} inde omnia loca ibi, tum montes
