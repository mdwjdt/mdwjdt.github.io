<h3 align="center" class="ired">属天的奥秘 第5393节</h3>
<h4 align="center"></h4><p><strong>5393.</strong>众所周知，属肠道的结肠分布广泛；在这个区域里面的人也同样分布广泛。他们向左前方延伸，形成一条曲线通向地狱。毫无怜悯、没有良知的人就在这个地狱；他们渴望毁灭人类，也就是说，渴望杀人抢劫，不管受害者是否反抗，也不管他们是男是女。大量士兵及其军官就具有这种恶毒的秉性；他们不是在战争期间，而是在战争结束后恶毒恐吓被征服者和手无寸铁的人，在狂怒中杀害并掠夺他们。我曾与天使谈论这类灵人。他们的本质和人类在放任自己，即法律不存在，他们可以为所欲为时的本质是一样的。在这种情况下，他们远比最凶残的动物凶残得多；即便最凶残的动物也不怎么倾向于屠杀自己的同类，除非是为了自卫。这些动物也以指定给它们为食物的生物而饱腹；可一旦饱腹，它们就不再做这种事。而受残忍和野蛮驱使的人类则不然。<br />天使对人类具有这样的性质而感到毛骨悚然。因为人一看到血流成河，满地鲜血，就发自内心欢喜，他们的灵就兴奋；然而，他们不为自己的国家获得解放高兴，仅仅为自己被誉为大人物和英雄而高兴。他们自诩为基督徒，甚至以为自己会上天堂；然而，天堂里除了平安、怜悯和仁爱之外什么都没有。这种人在结肠和直肠的地狱里。他们当中尚残存一点人性的人出现在曲线的左前方，在一种墙里面；然而，他们里面仍有大量自我之爱。有些人的确关心何为良善，有时这一点由几乎像火一样、但不白亮的小星星来代表。有一堵墙出现在我面前，好像是用灰泥砌的，上面还有雕像。这堵墙靠近我的左肘，变得越发宽阔，同时也变得更高，上半部分的颜色接近蓝色。我被告知，这代表这类灵人当中较好的一些灵人。</p>

It is well known that the colon intestine spreads out wide, and so do those who are in this province. They spread out in front toward the left in a curved line, leading to a hell. In that hell are they 
who have been merciless, and who without conscience have desired to destroy mankind, namely, to kill and to plunder them without respect or distinction of persons, whether they resist or not, and whether 
they are men or women. Of such a ferocious disposition are a great part of the soldiery and their officers, who, not in battle but after it, rage ferociously against the conquered and unarmed, 
and kill and despoil them in their fury. I have conversed with angels about such men, as to what they are when left to themselves and permitted to act without law and with freedom, how they are much more 
savage than the worst wild beasts, which do not so rush to the destruction of their own species, but merely defend themselves and appease their hunger with what is allotted them for food, and when 
sated do no such things. It is otherwise with the man who acts thus from cruelty and ferocity. The angels were horrified that mankind should be of such a nature as to first begin to rejoice at heart 
and be elated in mind when they see the whole field strewn with fallen troops, and reeking with blood-not rejoicing that their country has been freed, but only in being themselves lauded as great men 
and heroes. And yet they call themselves Christians, and even believe that they will come into heaven, where there is nothing but peace, mercy, and charity. Such are in the hell of the colon and rectum. 
But those of them in whom there had been any humanity appear in front to the left in a curved line, within a kind of wall; yet there is still much of the love of self in them. If any of these have 
a regard for what is good, this is sometimes represented by little stars almost fiery, but not of white light. A wall appeared to me as it were of plaster with molded figures, near the left elbow, which 
wall became more extended and at the same time higher, the upper part verging in color to sky-blue; and I was told that this was a representative of some spirits of this kind who were better. </p>

It is well known that the colon<A name="fntext1"></a><A href="#fn1"><sup>a</sup></a> belonging to the intestines is extensive; and so also are those within that province. They extend, in a frontal direction on the left side, in a line that curves and 
leads to a hell. In that hell there are those who have been devoid of all pity, and having no conscience have been willing to destroy the human race. That is to say, they have been willing to kill and 
rob people, taking no account at all of whether or not their victims offer any resistance, or whether they are men or women. A vicious disposition of mind such as this exists with a large section of 
soldiers and their officers; not during battles but after these are over they viciously terrorize the conquered and defenceless, and in their fury murder and rob them. I have talked to angels about spirits 
of this kind. Their essential nature is the same as that of human beings when left to themselves - when no law exists and they are permitted to act just as they like. In those circumstances they 
are far more savage than the most savage among animals, which are less inclined to plunge into killing members of their own species, except in self-defence. These also satisfy their hunger with those 
creatures assigned to them as their food; but once their hunger is satisfied they cease to behave in such vicious ways. But the human being, when motivated by cruel and savage feelings, is different. </p>

<p><b>[2]</b>
Angels have been horrified that the human race is like this. For as soon as men see lines of troops strewn and streams of blood flowing over the whole field, their hearts are full of joy and their 
spirits are elated; yet they feel no joy that their country has been set free, only that they are hailed as mighty ones and heroes. Yet such men call themselves Christians and even believe that they 
will go to heaven, where however nothing but peace, pity, and charity dwell. Such are in the hell of the colon and rectum. Those however in whom some humanity is present are seen in a frontal direction 
on the left side, in the line that curves, yet on the inside of a kind of wall. But even within these people much self-love is present. Some do have a concern for what is good, which is sometimes 
represented by tiny stars that are almost fiery yet not bright. Once a wall appeared before me that seemed to be made of plaster and to have carved figures. This wall, which was near my left elbow, 
became more extensive and at the same time taller, the colour of the upper part verging on blue. I was told that this was representative of some of the better ones among this kind of spirits.

Notum est quod intestinum colon se late extendat, ita quoque qui in provincia illa {1}; se extendunt antrorsum sinistrum versus in linea curva, pergendo ad infernum; in inferno illo sunt qui nulla misericordia 
praediti fuerunt, et absque conscientia genus humanum perdere voluerunt, nempe interficere et spoliare absque respectu et delectu sive resistant sive non resistant, sive viri sint sive feminae; 
tali feroci animo est {2} multa pars militum et eorum praefectorum, qui non in pugnis sed post pugnas cum ferocitate contra victos et inermes grassantur, et cum furore occidunt et spoliant; cum 
angelis de talibus locutus sum, quales sunt homines sibi relicti, et cum absque lege et {3} ex libero permittitur illis agere, quod multo feriores sint feris pessimis quae non ita ad internecionem speciei 
suae ruunt, modo quod se defendant, et se satient illis quae ad victum illis dicata sunt, at cum satiati non talia faciunt; aliter homo, qui ex crudelitate et feritate; angeli horruerunt quod genus 
humanum tale sit; [2] tunc primum gaudent ex corde, et superbiunt animo, cum strata agmina et rivos sanguinis vident per totum campum, absque gaudio quod patria liberata sit, modo quod illi audiant 
magni et heroes; et tamen se Christianos vocant, et usque credunt se venturos in caelum ubi tamen non nisi quam pax, misericordia, charitas; tales in inferno coli et recti sunt. At vero illi quibus aliquid 
humani inerat, apparent {4} versus sinistrum antrorsum in linea curva, intra quendam parietem; at usque illis multum amoris sui inest; in quibus respectus inest pro bono, hoc repraesentatur quandoque 
per stellulas paene igneas, non candidas.  Apparuit mihi paries quasi gypseus cum sculpturis, prope ad sinistram ulnam, qui paries extensior factus et simul altior, colore superius vergente ad 
caeruleum; dictum quod repraesentativum esset quorundam ex illo genere qui meliores fuerunt. </p>
