<h3 align="center" class="ired">属天的奥秘 第6585节</h3>
<h4 align="center"></h4><p><strong>6585.</strong>“也生养在约瑟的膝上”表它们来自从内在而来、与真理结合的良善。这从“生养在膝上”的含义和“约瑟”的代表清楚可知：“生养在膝上”是指良善与真理的结合（参看<a href="3915.htm">3915</a>节）；“约瑟”是指内在（<a href="6499.htm">6499</a>节）。玛吉的儿子生养在约瑟的膝上这句话说明，约瑟承认他们是他自己的；因为当经上如此说时，意思是说，他们被视为他自己的，这从拉结的使女辟拉所生的儿子可以看出来，关于辟拉，拉结说：<br />看哪，我的使女辟拉；你可以与她同房，使她生子在我膝下，我便因她也被建立。（创世记<a href="http://39-27.cn/创30.3.htm">30:3</a>）<br />约瑟之所以承认这些子孙是他自己的，是因为玛拿西代表教会的意愿，因而代表它的良善；约瑟所代表的内在以良善流入，而非以真理流入，除非通过良善；这就是为何经上说这些子孙“生养在约瑟约瑟的膝上”。</p>

Were born upon Joseph's knees. That this signifies that they were from good conjoined with truth from the internal, is evident from the signification of "bringing forth on the knees," as being the conjunction 
of good and truth (see n. 3915); and from the representation of Joseph, as being the internal (n. 6499). The sons of Machir being born upon Joseph's knees involves that Joseph acknowledged them 
as his own, for when it is so said, it is signified that they are adopted as his own, as may be seen from the sons born of Bilhah the maidservant of Rachel, concerning whom Rachel says: </p>
<p>     Behold 
my handmaid Bilhah, come unto her, and she shall bear upon my knees, and I also shall be built up by her (Gen. 30:3). The reason why these sons were acknowledged by Joseph as his own, was that by 
Manasseh is represented the will of the church, thus its good; and the internal which is represented by Joseph flows in with good, but not with truth except through good; hence it is that these are said 
to be "born upon Joseph's knees." </p>

<p align="center"><b>Elliott(1983-1999) 6585</b></p><p><b>6585.</b>
'Were born on Joseph's knees' means that they were from good joined to truth from the internal. This is clear from the meaning of 'bearing on the knees' as goodness and truth joined together, dealt with 
in <a href="3915.htm">3915</a>; and from the representation of 'Joseph' as the internal, dealt with in <a href="6499.htm">6499</a>. The statement that the sons of Machir were born on Joseph's knees implies that Joseph recognized them as his own; 
for when that expression is used the meaning is that they are adopted as one's own, as may be seen from the sons born from Bilhah, Rachel's maidservant. Referring to those sons Rachel says, </p>
<blockquote>
Behold, 
my maidservant Bilhah; go [in] to her, and let her bear [a child] upon my knees, and I too shall be built up from her. <a href="http://bible.gospelcom.net/cgi-bin/bible?passage=Gen%2030:3&amp;version=ESV&amp;interface=print&amp;showfn=yes&amp;showxref">Gen 30:3</a>.  
</blockquote>
<p>The reason why the sons were recognized by Joseph as his own 
is that 'Manasseh' represents the Church's area of will, thus its good; and the internal, which 'Joseph' represents, flows into it with good, but not with truth except through good. This is why they are 
spoken of as ones who 'were born on Joseph's knees'. </p>

`Nati super genubus Josephi': quod significet quod a bono conjuncto cum vero ab interno, constat ex significatione `parere super genubus' quod sit conjunctio boni et veri, de qua n. 3915; et ex repraesentatione 
`Josephi' quod sit internum, de qua n. 6499. Quod {1}filii Machir dicantur `nati super genubus Josephi', involvit quod Joseph agnoverit illos pro suis, nam cum ita dicitur, significatur quod 
adoptentur sicut proprii; ut constare potest ex filiis ex Bilhah famula Rachelis, de quibus Rachel dicit, Ecce famula mea Bilhah, veni ad illam, et pariat super genua mea, et aedificabor etiam ego 
ex illa, Gen. xxx 3. Quod illi filii a Josepho agniti sint {2} pro suis, est quia per `Menashen' repraesentatur {3} voluntarium Ecclesiae, ita bonum ejus; ac internum quod repraesentatur per `Josephum', 
influit cum bono, non autem cum vero nisi per bonum; inde est quod hi dicantur `nati super genubus Josephi' {4}. @1 hi filii$ @2 quasi$ @3 novum$ @4 i quod agnoverit$ </p>
