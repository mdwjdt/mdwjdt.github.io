Verses 3-8. And Moses went up unto God, and Jehovah called unto him from the mountain, saying, Thus shalt thou say unto the house of Jacob, and declare to the sons of Israel: Ye have seen what I did 
to the Egyptians, and I bare you on eagles' wings, and brought you unto Me. And now if hearing ye shall hear My voice, and keep My covenant, then ye shall be Mine own possession above all peoples; because 
all the earth is Mine; and ye shall be to Me a kingdom of priests, and a holy nation; these are the words which thou shalt speak unto the sons of Israel. And Moses came and called the elders of the 
people, and set before them all these words which Jehovah commanded him. And all the people answered together, and said, All that Jehovah hath spoken we will do; and Moses reported the words of the 
people unto Jehovah.  "And Moses went up unto God," signifies the truth from the Divine which is beneath heaven conjoining itself with the Divine truth which is in heaven; "and Jehovah called unto him 
from the mountain, saying," signifies the union of the Divine good in heaven with the Divine truth there; "Thus shalt thou say to the house of Jacob, and declare to the sons of Israel," signifies the 
salvation of those who are of the external and internal spiritual church; "Ye have seen what I did to the Egyptians," signifies the remembrance of all things that befell the evil who infested; "and 
I bare you on eagles' wings," signifies and that by means of truths they were raised to heavenly light; "and brought you unto Me," signifies thus to the good of love which is in heaven; "and now if hearing 
ye shall hear My voice," signifies the reception of truth; "and keep My covenant," signifies thus life in good and the consequent conjunction; "then ye shall be Mine own possession above all peoples," 
signifies that then the Divine truth shall be with them more than with others; "because all the earth is Mine," signifies that the Lord has all power in heaven and on earth; "and ye shall be to 
Me a kingdom of priests," signifies that then the good of truth shall be with them; "and a holy nation," signifies thus the spiritual kingdom; "these are the words which thou shalt speak unto the sons 
of Israel," signifies influx for the receiving of truths in good; "and Moses came and called the elders of the people," signifies the choosing of those who were primarily in the intelligence of truth; 
"and set before them all these words," signifies a setting forth, together with influx; "which Jehovah commanded him," signifies from the Divine; "and all the people answered," signifies reception; 
"and said, All that Jehovah hath spoken we will do," signifies according to influx from the Divine; "and Moses reported the words of the people unto Jehovah," signifies correspondence and conjunction. </p>

Verses 3 8 And Moses went up to God, and Jehovah called to him from the mountain, saying, Thus you shall say to the house of Jacob, and tell the children of Israel, You have seen what I did to the Egyptians,

at that time the good of truth will be with them. 'And a holy nation' means thus the spiritual kingdom. 'These are the words which you shall speak to the children of Israel' means influx in order

Vers. 3-8.  Et Moscheh ascendit ad Deum; et vocavit ad illum Jehovah e monte, dicendo, Ita dices domui Jacobi, et nuntiabis filiis Israelis.  Vos vidistis quod feci Aegyptiis, et tuli vos super alis 
aquilarum, et adduxi vos ad Me.  Et nunc si audiendo audiveritis vocem Meam, et custodiveritis foedus Meum, et eritis Mihi peculium prae omnibus populis; quia Mihi omnis terra.  Et vos eritis Mihi regnum 
sacerdotum, et gens sancta; haec verba quae loqueris ad filios Israelis.  Et venit Moscheh, et vocavit seniores populi, et posuit coram illis omnia verba illa quae praecepit illi Jehovah.  Et responderunt 
omnis populus simul, et dixerunt, Omne quod locutus Jehovah faciemus; et retulit Moscheh verba populi ad Jehovam.  `Et Moscheh ascendit ad Deum' significat verum a Divino quod infra caelum se'

prae aliis: `quia Mihi omnis terra' significat quod omnis potestas Domino in caelo et in terra: `et vos eritis Mihi regnum sacerdotum' significat quod tunc bonum veri apud illos: `et gens sancta' significat 
sic regnum spirituale: `haec verba quae loqueris ad filios Israelis' significat influxum ad recipiendum vera in bono: `et venit Moscheh, et vocavit seniores populi' significat electionem illorum 
qui primario in intelligentia veri: `et posuit coram illis omnia verba illa' significat propositionem cum influxu: `quae praecepit illi Jehovah' significat ex Divino: `et responderunt omnis populus' 
significat receptionem: `et dixerunt, Omne quod locutus Jehovah' faciemus' significat secundum influxum a Divino: `et retulit Moscheh verba populi ad Jehovam' significat correspondentiam et conjunctionem. </p>
