<h3 align="center" class="ired">属天的奥秘 第8993节</h3>
<h4 align="center"></h4><p><strong>8993.</strong>“人若卖女儿作婢女”表源于属世快乐的对真理的情感。这从“人的女儿”和“婢女”的含义清楚可知：“人的女儿”是指对真理的情感，因为“女儿”表示情感（参看<a href="2362.htm">2362</a>，<a href="3963.htm">3963</a>节），而“人”表示真理（<a href="5414.htm">5414</a>，<a href="5879.htm">5879</a>，<a href="5951.htm">5951</a>，<a href="7957.htm">7957</a>，<a href="8234.htm">8234</a>节）；“婢女”是指外在或属世情感（<a href="2567.htm">2567</a>，<a href="3835.htm">3835</a>，<a href="3849.htm">3849</a>节）。因此，“人的女儿被卖作婢女”表示源于属世情感和快乐的对真理的情感。<br />属世的快乐是指发源于自我之爱和尘世之爱的快乐。处于发源于这些爱的对真理的情感之人是那些要么为了利益，要么为了重要地位，而不是为生活而学习教会的教义，也就是所谓的信之真理的人。对真理的这类情感并非发源于属灵良善，而是发源于属世的快乐，它们由被卖作女奴或婢女的以色列人的女儿来代表。源于自我之爱或尘世之爱的一切都不是自由，而是奴役。至于何谓自由，何谓“奴役”，可参看前文（<a href="892.htm">892</a>，<a href="905.htm">905</a>，<a href="1947.htm">1947</a>，<a href="2870.htm">2870</a>-<a href="2893.htm">2893</a>，<a href="6205.htm">6205</a>节）。由这些爱所产生的对真理的情感的性质就接下来的经文在内义上所描述的。<br />要牢记一点：对真理的纯正情感在于意愿并渴望为了作为目的的良善功用，为了生活而知道真正的信之真理；但并不纯正的对真理的情感则在于为了自我，因而为了获得重要地位、谋取金钱利益而意愿并渴望真理。那些处于来自这种源头的对真理的情感之人并不在乎他们所学习的真理是否纯正，只要它们能冒充或被当作真理就行。因此，他们只认可他们所出生的教会的教义，无论这些教义是不是真的。就真理本身而言，他们还陷入黑暗，因为世俗的目的或利益，自私的目的或重要地位完全蒙蔽了他们的双眼。<br />但那些拥有对真理的纯正情感之人，也就是那些为了良善的功用、为了他们当过的生活而渴望知道真理的人也遵守教会的教义，直到他们达到开始独立思考的年龄。然后，他们就查考圣经，求主光照；当被光照时，他们从心里欢欣鼓舞。因为他们知道，如果他们所出生的地方有别的教会教义，甚至有最大的异端，那么若不出于对真理的纯正情感查考圣经，他们就会留在这教义中；例如，他们若生来就是犹太人，或苏西尼派，就会这样做。由此明显可知那些拥有对真理的纯正情感之人究竟是谁，是何性质；那些拥有不纯正的对真理的情感之人又是谁，是何性质。那些拥有对真理的纯正情感之人在代表意义上由以色列人的女儿来表示；而那些拥有不纯正的对真理的情感之人在代表意义上则由以色列女儿当中的婢女来表示，她们就是现在所论述的主题。</p>

And when a man shall sell his daughter to be a maid-servant. That this signifies the affection of truth from natural delight, is evident from the signification of "a man's daughter," as being the affection 
of truth, for by "a daughter" is signified affection (see n. 2362, 3963), and by "man," truth (n. 3134), as also by "an Israelite," who is here meant by "a man" (n. 5414, 5879, 5951, 7957, 8234); 
and from the signification of "a maidservant," as being external or natural affection (n. 2567, 3835, 3849); consequently by "a man's daughter being sold for a maidservant" is signified the affection 
of truth from the delight of natural affection. [2] By natural delight is meant the delight that flows forth from the love of self and the love of the world. They who are in the affection of truth 
from this, are they who learn the doctrinal things of the church, which are called the truths of faith, either for the sake of gain, or for the sake of honors, and not for the sake of life. Such affections 
of truth, which do not flow forth from spiritual good, but from natural delight, are represented by the daughter of an Israelitish man sold to be a handmaid or maidservant; for everything which 
has its origin from the love of self, or from love of the world, is not free; but servile (what is meant by "free," and what by "servile," see n. 892, 905, 1947, 2870-2893, 6205). How the case is with 
the affections of truth that originate from these loves, is described in the internal sense in what now follows. [3] Bear in mind that the genuine affection of truth is willing and longs to know the 
veriest truths of faith for the sake of good use as the end, and for the sake of life; but the affection of truth that is not genuine desires and longs for truths for the sake of self, thus for seeking 
honors, and for hunting gains. They who are in the affection of truth from this origin do not care whether the truths they know are genuine, provided they are such as they can pass off as truths; 
and therefore they stick in the mere confirmation of the doctrinal things of the church in which they were born, whether these be true or not true. They are also in darkness in respect to truths themselves, 
for worldly ends which are gains, and bodily ends which are honors, completely blindfold them. [4] But they who are in the genuine affection of truth, that is, who long to know truths for the 
sake of good use, and for the sake of life, also abide in the doctrinal things of the church until they arrive at the age when they begin to think for themselves; then they search the Scriptures and supplicate 
the Lord for enlightenment, and when they are enlightened they rejoice from the heart. For they know that if they had been born where there is another doctrine of the church, nay, the greatest 
heresy, without searching the Scriptures from the genuine affection of truth, they would have remained in that doctrine; as for example, if they had been born Jews, or if they had been born Socinians. 
From this it is plain who and of what quality they are who are in the genuine affection of truth, and who and of what quality they are who are in an affection of truth that is not genuine. They who 
are in the genuine affection of truth are in the representative sense the daughters of Israelitish men; but they who are in an affection of truth that is not genuine are in the representative sense 
maidservants from the daughters of Israel. </p>

'And when a man sells his daughter to be a female slave' means an affection for truth springing from natural delight. This is clear from the meaning of 'a man's daughter' as an affection for truth, for 
an affection is meant by 'daughter', dealt with in <a href="2362.htm">2362</a>, <a href="3963.htm">3963</a>, while truth is meant by 'a man', <a href="3134.htm">3134</a>, as it also is by an Israelite, whom 'a man' refers to here, <a href="5414.htm">5414</a>, <a href="5879.htm">5879</a>, <a href="5951.htm">5951</a>, <a href="7957.htm">7957</a>, <a href="8234.htm">8234</a>; and from 
the meaning of 'a female slave' as an external or natural affection, dealt with in <a href="2567.htm">2567</a>, <a href="3835.htm">3835</a>, <a href="3849.htm">3849</a>. Consequently 'a man's daughter sold as a female slave' means an affection for truth springing from 
natural affection and delight. </p>

 By natural delight one should understand delight emanating from self-love and love of the world. The people with an affection for truth emanating from these kinds 
of love are those who learn the teachings of the Church, carted the truths of faith, either for the sake of gain or for the sake of important positions, and not for the sake of the life they should 
lead. Since affections such as this do not emanate from spiritual good but from natural delight they are represented by the daughter of an Israelite man sold as a female slave or servant-girl. For 
whatever owes its origin to self-love or love of the world is not freedom but slavery. What freedom and slavery are, see <a href="892.htm">892</a>, <a href="905.htm">905</a>, <a href="1947.htm">1947</a>, <a href="2870.htm">2870</a>-<a href="2893.htm">2893</a>, <a href="6205.htm">6205</a> The nature of affection for truth arising from 
those kinds of love is described in the internal sense of what follows next. </p>
<p></p>
<p><b>[3]</b>
 It should be borne in mind that a genuine affection for truth consists in willing and desiring to know the real truths 
of faith with a view to putting them to good use and for the sake of the life one should lead. But an affection for truth which is not genuine consists in willing and desiring truths for selfish reasons, 
that is, in order to acquire important positions and make monetary gain. Those with an affection for truth that has this origin do not care whether the truths they learn are genuine or not, provided 
that they are such as can be palmed off as truths. This being so, they confine themselves to endorsing the teachings of the Church in which they were born, regardless of whether those teachings 
are true or not. They are also in the dark so far as real truths are concerned; for worldly ends or gains, and selfish<A name="fntext1"></a><A href="#fn1"><sup>a</sup></a> ends or important positions make people completely blind. </p>
<p></p>
<p><b>[4]</b>
 But those with 
a genuine affection for truth, that is, those who desire to know truths to put them to good use and for the sake of the life they ought to lead, they too keep to the teachings of the Church, until they 
reach the age when they begin to think for themselves. Then they examine the Scriptures and pray to the Lord for enlightenment; and when they receive it, their hearts rejoice. For they know that if 
they had been born where the teachings of the Church are different, indeed where the greatest heresy exists, then - if they had not examined Scripture from a genuine affection for truth- they would have 
remained in it, as for example they would have done if they had been born Jews, or they had been born Socinians. All this shows who exactly those people are, and what they are like, who have a genuine 
affection for truth, and who they are, and what they are like, who have an affection for truth that is not genuine Those with a genuine affection for truth are meant in the representative sense by 
the daughters of Israelite men; but those with an affection for truth that is not genuine are meant in the representative sense by female slaves from among the daughters of Israel, who are the subject 
at present.

`Et cum vendiderit vir filiam suam ad ancillam': quod significet affectionem veri ex jucundo naturali, constat ex significatione `filiae viri' quod sit (t)affectio veri, {1}per `filiam' enim significatur 
affectio, de qua n. 2362, 3963, per `virum' autem verum, n. 3134, ut quoque per Israelitam, qui hic per `virum' intelligitur, n. (x)5414, 5879, 5951, (x)7957, 8234; et ex significatione `ancillae' 
quod sit affectio externa seu naturalis, de qua n. 2567, 3835, 3849; inde per `filiam viri {2}venditam in ancillam' significatur affectio veri ex jucundo affectionis {3}naturali. 2 Per jucundum naturale 
intelligitur jucundum profluens ex amore sui et amore mundi; qui in affectione veri inde sunt, sunt qui doctrinalia Ecclesiae, quae vera fidei vocantur, discunt vel propter lucrum vel propter honores, 
et non propter vitam; tales affectiones veri, (x)quia profluunt non ex bono spirituali sed ex jucundo naturali, repraesentantur {4}per filiam viri Israelitici venditam in ancillam seu servam , 
nam omne id quod trahit originem ex amore sui aut amore mundi, non (t)liberum est sed {5}servum; quid liberum et quid servum, videatur n. 892, 905, 1947, 2870-2893, 6205.  Quomodo se habet cum affectionibus 
veri {6}ex illis amoribus oriundis, in sensu interno describitur in {7}nunc sequentibus. 	3 Tenendum quod affectio veri genuina sit velle et desiderare scire ipsissima vera fidei propter usum 
bonum ut finem, et propter vitam, at affectio veri non genuina est velle et desiderare {8} vera propter semet, ita {9}ad captandos honores (e)ac {9} ad aucupanda lucra; qui {10}in affectione veri ex

nati sunt, sive haec vera sint sive non vera; sunt quoque in tenebris quoad ipsa vera, fines enim mundani qui sunt lucra, et fines corporei qui sunt honores, prorsus occaecant; at qui in affectione 
4 veri genuina sunt, hoc est, qui desiderant scire vera propter usum bonum et propter vitam, illi quoque manent in doctrinalibus Ecclesiae{12} usque dum perveniunt ad aetatem cum ex se cogitare incipiunt, 
tunc scrutantur scripturas, et supplicant ad Dominum de illustratione, et cum illustrantur, gaudent ex corde; sciunt enim quod si nati fuissent ubi alia Ecclesiae doctrina, immo ubi maxima haeresis,
