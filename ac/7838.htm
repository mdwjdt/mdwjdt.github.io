<h3 align="center" class="ired">属天的奥秘 第7838节</h3>
<h4 align="center"></h4><p><strong>7838.</strong>“一只公的”表这是植根于仁之信的特征。这从“公的”的含义清楚可知，“公的”是指信之真理（参看<a href="2046.htm">2046</a>，<a href="4005.htm">4005</a>节），因而是指植根于仁的信；因为信之真理并不是信之真理，除非它与仁之良善共存，尤其是它源于该良善。逾越节的动物之所以必须是公的，是因为逾越节的动物表示那些属于属灵教会之人的纯真。那些属于属灵教会的人除了本身为信之真理的东西外，没有别的良善；因为当这种真理通过仁爱的情感被付诸行动时，它就被称为良善（参看<a href="7835.htm">7835</a>节）。这就是为何动物必须是公的或说雄性的。在其它时候，当要代表源于良善的敬拜时，母的或说雌性动物也用于祭祀。</p>

A male. That this signifies which is of the faith of charity, is evident from the signification of "a male," as being the truth of faith (see n. 2046, 4005), thus the faith of charity; for the truth 
of faith is not the truth of faith unless it is together with the good of charity, and especially unless it is from it. The reason why the paschal animal was to be a male, was that the paschal animal 
signified the innocence of those who were of the spiritual church; and they who are of the spiritual church are in no other good than that which in itself is the truth of faith, for this is called good 
when it is brought into act from the affection of charity (see n. 7835). Hence it is that the animal was to be a male. In other cases in the sacrifices, female animals of the flock were employed, when 
worship from good was to be represented. </p>

'A male' means which is characteristic of faith rooted in charity. This is clear from the meaning of 'a male' as the truth of faith, dealt with in <a href="2046.htm">2046</a>, <a href="4005.htm">4005</a>, and so faith rooted in charity, since the 
truth of faith is not the truth of faith unless it exists together with the good of charity, and springs from that good most of all. The reason why the Passover animal had to be a male was that that 
animal was a sign of the innocence of those belonging to the spiritual Church. And those belonging to the spiritual Church possess no other kind of good than that which is in itself the truth of faith; 
for this is called good when from charitable affection it is put into action, <a href="7835.htm">7835</a>. This is why it had to be a male animal. At other times female animals were also used in sacrifices, when worship 
springing from good was to be represented. </p>

`Masculam': quod (x)significet quae fidei charitatis, constat ex significatione `masculi' quod sit verum fidei, de qua n. 2046, 4005, ita fides charitatis, nam verum fidei non est verum fidei {1} nisi 
(x)sit cum bono charitatis, imprimis ex illo.  Quod pecus paschalis mascula esset, causa erat quia `pecus' illa significabat innocentiam illorum qui ab Ecclesia spirituali; et illi qui ab Ecclesia 
spirituali non in alio bono sunt quam quod in se est verum fidei, hoc enim dicitur bonum cum ex affectione charitatis in actum mittitur, n. 7835; inde est quod pecus mascula esset.  Alioquin in sacrificiis 
etiam adhibebantur pecudes femellae, cum cultus ex bono {2}repraesentaretur. 	@1 i apud aliquem$ 	@2 significaretur$ </p>
