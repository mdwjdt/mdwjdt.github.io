Verses 19-21. And now send, gather in thy cattle, and all that thou hast in the field; every man and beast that shall be found in the field, and shall not be brought to the house, the hail shall come 
down upon them, and they shall die. He that feared the word of Jehovah of the servants of Pharaoh, made his servants and his cattle flee unto the houses; and he that did not set his heart unto the word 
of Jehovah left his servants and his cattle in the field. "And now send, gather in thy cattle," signifies that the truth of good should be collected; "and all that thou hast in the field," signifies 
which is of the church; "every man and beast," signifies interior and exterior good; "that shall be found in the field," signifies that is of the church; "and shall not be brought to the house," signifies 
which is not reserved; "the hail shall come down upon them, and they shall die," signifies that they shall be quite destroyed by falsity; "he that feared the word of Jehovah of the servants of 
Pharaoh," signifies those things in the natural mind which were of the Lord; "made his servants and his cattle flee unto the houses," signifies that they were stored up and reserved in the interiors; 
"and he that did not set his heart unto the word of Jehovah," signifies the things which were not from the Lord; "left his servants and his cattle in the field," signifies that they were not stored up 
and reserved. </p>

<p>'And now send, assemble your livestock' means that the truth of good should be gathered. 'And all that you have in the field' means what belongs 
to the Church. 'Every man and beast' means interior and exterior good. 'That is found in the field' means which belongs to the Church. 'And will not be gathered home' means which is not in safe 
keeping. 'The hail will come down on them and they will die' means that it will be completely destroyed by falsity. 'And he that feared the word of Jehovah among the servants of Pharaoh' means those things 
in the natural mind which were the Lord's. 'Caused his servants and his livestock to flee to the houses' means that they were stored away and placed in safe keeping interiorly. 'And he that did 
not take the word of Jehovah to heart' means the things which were not from the Lord. 'Left his servants and his livestock in the field' means that they were not stored away and placed in safekeeping.
