<h3 align="center" class="ired">属天的奥秘 第3915节</h3>
<h4 align="center"></h4><p><strong>3915.</strong>“使她生子在我膝下”表内在真理情感的承认，结合就始于这种情感。这从“生子”和“膝”或“大腿”的含义清楚可知：“生子”是指信仰和行为上的承认（参看<a href="3905.htm">3905</a>节）；“膝”或“大腿”是指属于婚姻之爱的事物（<a href="3021.htm">3021</a>节），因而是指属于信之真理与爱之良善结合的事物；因为真理与良善的这种结合是主国度中最根本的婚姻。因此，“生子在我膝下”表对“拉结”所代表的内在真理的一种承认。古人通过妻子的同意而承认使女或婢女所生孩子的合法地位，他们承在妻子膝下以便得到承认。这一习俗源于古教会，因为古教会的敬拜在于宗教仪式，而这些仪式是属天和属灵之物的代表和有意义的符号。在古教会，由于“生子”表示对真理的承认，而“膝”表示婚姻之爱，因而表示出于情感的良善与真理的结合，所以，当妻子不生育时，便采纳了这种仪式，以防止她代表不能复活得生命的死人（照刚才所述，<a href="3908.htm">3908</a>节）。<br />就内义而言，这些话表示由情感所产生的肯定或承认的第二层级。因为若要产生结合，情感必须存在于承认或肯定中。事实上，一切结合都通过情感产生，因为没有情感，真理就没有任何生命可言。例如，知道以下真理，即：当爱邻舍，仁爱就在于此，并且属灵的生命在于仁爱，却没有情感，即没有发自内心对它们的意愿，就纯粹是记忆知识。没有情感，这些真理就没有生命；不管人有多么了解它们，他仍不会爱他的邻舍，而是爱自己胜过邻舍，并且过着一种属世的生活，而非一种属灵的生活。他的属世情感统治属灵情感，并且只要属世情感占统治地位，人就被称为“死的”，因为他里面所拥有的生命是天堂生命的反面，而天堂生命才是真正的生命。</p>

And she shall bear upon my knees. That this signifies acknowledgment in the affection of interior truth, from which there is conjunction, is evident from the signification of "bearing," as being to acknowledge 
in faith and act (see n. 3905); and from the signification of "knees," or "thighs," as being the things that belong to conjugial love (n. 3021); thus the things that belong to the conjunction 
of the truth of faith with the good of love; for this conjunction is the very conjugial principle in the Lord's kingdom. Thus "bearing upon my knees" signifies an acknowledgment of the interior truth 
represented by Rachel. The custom among the ancients of sons and daughters being acknowledged as legitimate who were born of handmaids by consent of the wife, and brought forth upon her knees in order 
that they might be acknowledged, was derived from the Ancient Church, whose worship consisted in rituals that were representative and significative of celestial and spiritual things. In that church, 
because "bearing" signified the acknowledgment of truth, and "knees" conjugial love, thus the conjunction of good and truth from affection, such a ritual was accepted when the wife was barren, to the 
intent that she might not represent the dead who do not rise again to life (according to what has been said just above, n. 3908). [2] In the internal sense by these words there is signified a second 
degree of affirmation or acknowledgment, which is from affection; for in order that the conjunction may take place, there must be affection within the acknowledgment or affirmation; for all conjunction 
is effected by means of affection, because without affection truths have no life. For example: to know the truths that the neighbor must be loved, and that charity consists in this, and in charity 
spiritual life, is bare memory-knowledge, unless attended with affection, that is, unless they are willed from the heart. Without affection these truths do not live, and however well anyone knows them, 
he nevertheless does not love his neighbor, but himself more than him, and he is in natural life, but not in spiritual life. It is natural affection that rules over spiritual affection, and so long 
as natural affection rules, the man is called "dead," for he has a life contrary to heavenly life, and heavenly life is the veriest life. </p>

'And let her bear [a child] upon my knees' means acknowledgement by the affection for interior truth, in which affection the joining begins. This is clear from the meaning of 'bearing' as acknowledging 
in action as well as in faith, dealt with above in <a href="3905.htm">3905</a>, and from the meaning of 'the knees' or the thighs as things which belong to conjugial love, dealt with in <a href="3021.htm">3021</a>, and so to things to do with 
the joining of the truth of faith to the good of love, since this joining of truth and good is the fundamental marriage in the Lord's kingdom. Thus 'bearing upon my knees' means an acknowledgement of 
interior truth represented by 'Rachel'. The custom among the ancients of acknowledging as legitimate sons and daughters those who, with the consent of the wife, were borne by servant- girls, and who were 
born upon their [wives'] knees so that they would be acknowledged as such, was a custom that derived from the Ancient Church whose worship consisted in religious practices which were representatives 
and meaningful signs of celestial and spiritual things. Since 'bearing' meant the acknowledgement of truth, and 'knees' conjugial love, and so the joining of good and truth from affection, such a practice 
was followed in that Church when a wife was childless, to prevent her representing the dead who do not rise again to life, in accordance with what was stated just above in <a href="3908.htm">3908</a>. </p>
<p></p>
<p><b>[2]</b>
 These words 
mean in the internal sense a second degree of affirmation or acknowledgement resulting from affection, for affection has to be present in acknowledgement or affirmation if the joining together is 
to be effected. Indeed all conjunction is effected by means of affection, for without affection truths do not have any life. For example, knowing the truths that the neighbour ought to be loved, and 
that charity consists in that love, and spiritual life in charity, is no more than knowledge if affection is not present, that is, if there is no desire in the heart for any of this. Without affection 
these truths have no life, and no matter how well a person knows them he still does not love the neighbour but himself more than the neighbour, and is leading a natural life, not a spiritual one. In 
his case natural affection has dominion over spiritual affection, and as long as natural affection predominates a person is called 'dead', for the life he has in him is the reverse of heavenly life - 
heavenly life being true life. </p>

`Et pariat super genua mea': quod significet agnitionem affectione interioris veri, ex qua conjunctio, constat ex significatione `parere' quod sit agnoscere fide tum actu, de qua supra n. 3905; et 
ex significatione `genuum' seu femorum quod sint illa quae amoris conjugialis sunt, de qua n. 3021, ita quae sunt conjunctionis veri quod fidei et boni quod amoris, nam haec conjunctio est ipsum 
conjugiale in regno Domini; ita `parere super genua mea' significat agnitionem veri interioris quod per `Rachelem' repraesentatur.  Quod apud antiquos agnoscerentur filii et filiae pro legitimis qui 
nascebantur ab ancillis ex consensu uxoris, utque agnoscerentur, parerent super genua illorum, derivatum fuit ab Antiqua Ecclesia, cujus cultus constabat in ritualibus quae repraesentativa et significativa 
caelestium et spiritualium erant; in illa, nempe Ecclesia, quia `parere' significabat agnitionem veri, et `genua' amorem conjugialem, ita conjunctionem boni et veri ex affectione, tale rituale 
acceptum fuit cum uxor sterilis esset, ne repraesentaret mortuos qui ad vitam non resurgunt; secundum illa quae mox supra n. 3908 dicta sunt.  [2] Per {1}illa verba in sensu interno significatur 
alter gradus {2}affirmationis seu agnitionis, qui est ex affectione, affectio enim inerit agnitioni seu {3}affirmationi ut fiat conjunctio, omnis enim conjunctio fit per affectionem, nam absque affectione 
vera non vitam habent; (m)sicut pro exemplo: scire haec vera quod proximus amandus, et quod in eo charitas consistat, et in hac vita spiritualis, est nude scientia, nisi affectio sit, 
hoc est, nisi hoc velit ex corde; absque affectione vera haec non vivunt, sed utcumque illa scit, usque non amat proximum, sed se prae illo, ac in vita naturali est, non in spirituali; affectio naturalis 
est quae dominatur super affectione spirituali, et quamdiu affectio naturalis dominatur, homo vocatur mortuus, nam vitam contrariam vitae caelesti {4}habet; est vita caelestis ipsissima vita.(n) @1
