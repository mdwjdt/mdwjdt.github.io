<h4 align="center"></h4><p><strong>101.</strong>对于主是“东方”，这也从经文可知，例如：“他带我到一座门，就是朝东的门。以色列神的荣光从东而来，他的声音如同多水的声音，地就因他的荣耀发光。”（以西结书<a href="http://39-27.cn/结43.1.htm">43:1</a>-<a href="http://39-27.cn/结43.2.htm">2</a>，<a href="http://39-27.cn/结43.4.htm">4</a>）<br />正因主是“东方”，在圣殿兴建之前，面朝东方祷告也就成了象征性之犹太教的一个习俗。</p>

<p><strong>[NCE]101.</strong> The identification of the Lord as the east is also evident throughout the Word. In Ezekiel, for example:<br />He led me to the gate, a gate that looks out on the path to the east, and look! The glory of Israel's God came by way of the east, and his voice was like the voice of many waters, and the earth shone with his glory. (<a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_101/bible_king-james-version_ezekiel_43_1-2" target=_top>Ezekiel 43:1-2</a>, <a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_101/bible_king-james-version_ezekiel_43_4" target=_top>4</a>)<br />The practices of the Jewish church represented inner things; and as the Lord is the east, their sacred custom before the Temple was built was to turn their faces to the east when praying.{*1} <br /><strong>Footnotes:</strong><br />{*1} Compare Swedenborg's description of orientation in heaven: "They call ‘east' where the Lord is seen as the sun." Consequently, the angels in heaven face east no matter in which direction they turn — a fact that Swedenborg acknowledges to be somewhat difficult for humans to understand (<a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_101/swedenborg_heaven-and-hell-dole_141" target=_top>Heaven and Hell 141-143</a>).

That the Lord is the "east" also appears from the Word, as in Ezekiel: </p>
<p>     He brought me to the gate, even the gate that looketh the way of the east, and behold the glory of the God of Israel came 
from the way of the east; and His voice was as the voice of many waters, and the earth shone with His glory (Ezek. 43:1-2, 4). It was in consequence of the Lord's being the "east" that a holy custom 
prevailed in the representative Jewish Church, before the building of the temple, of turning their faces toward the east when they prayed. </p>

The Lord is 'the east'. This too is clear from several places in the Word, as in Ezekiel,  </p>
<blockquote>
He brought me to the gate, to the gate facing the way of the east. And behold, the glory of the God of Israel 
came from the way of the east, and His voice was like the voice of many waters, and the earth shone with His glory. <a href="http://bible.gospelcom.net/cgi-bin/bible?passage=Ezek%2043:1,%202,%204&amp;version=ESV&amp;interface=print&amp;showfn=yes&amp;showxref">Ezek 43:1, 2, 4</a>.   
</blockquote>
The Lord's being 'the east' was the reason for the sacred 
practice in the Jewish representative Church, before the Temple was built, of facing eastwards when praying.

</p><b>101.</b>
Quod Dominus sit 'Oriens,' etiam passim ex Verbo constat, ut apud Ezechielem, 	Duxit me ad portam, portam quae spectat viam orientis; et ecce gloria Dei Israelis venit a via orientis, et vox Ipsius 
sicut vox aquarum multarum, et terra splendebat a gloria Ipsius, xliii 1, 2, 4. Quia Dominus 'Oriens,' inde sanctum fuit in Ecclesia repraesentativa Judaica, antequam templum aedificatum, faciem vertere 
ad orientem cum orarent.
