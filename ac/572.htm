<h3 align="center" class="ired">属天的奥秘 第572节</h3>
<h4 align="center"></h4><p><strong>572.</strong>创世记6:3 耶和华说：“我的灵就不永远责备人，因他属乎血肉，然而他的日子还可到一百二十年。”<br />“耶和华说：我的灵就不永远责备人”是指人不再被如此引领；“因他属乎血肉”表示因他已变成肉体的；“他的日子还可到一百二十年”是指人当有信的余留。这也是预言将来的教会。</p>

<p><strong>[NCE]572.</strong> <a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_572/bible_king-james-version_genesis_6_3" target=_top>Genesis 6:3</a>. And Jehovah said, "My spirit will not denounce humankind forever, for this reason: that they are flesh. And their days will be one hundred twenty years."<br />Jehovah said, "My spirit will not denounce humankind forever," means that people would no longer be led in the same way. "For this reason: that they are flesh," means because they became body-centered. "And their days will be one hundred twenty years" means that they ought to have traces of faith left; and it is a prophecy about the church to come. </p>
<p align="center"><b>Potts(1905-1910) 572</b></p><p><b>572.</b>
Verse 3. And Jehovah said, My spirit shall not reprove man forever, for that he is flesh; and his days shall be a hundred and twenty years. By "Jehovah's saying My spirit shall not always reprove man" 
is signified that man would not be so led any longer; "for that he is flesh" signifies because he had become corporeal; "and his days shall be a hundred and twenty years" signifies that he ought to 
have remains of faith. It is also a prediction concerning a future church. </p>

Verse 7 And Jehovah said, My spirit will not reprove man forever, in that he is flesh; and his days will be a hundred and twenty years.  </p>
<p>'Jehovah said, My spirit will not reprove man for ever' means 
that man would be led in this fashion no longer. 'In that he is flesh' means because he became bodily-minded. 'And his days will be a hundred and twenty years' means that he ought to have remnants 
of faith. It is also a prediction concerning the future Church.  </p>

</p><b>572.</b>
Vers. 3.  Et dixit Jehovah, Non arguet spiritus Meus hominem in perpetuum, eo quod ille caro; et erunt dies ejus centum e viginti anni. 'Quod Jehovah {x}dixerit, Non arguet spiritus Meus hominem in 
perpetuum' significat quod homo non ita amplius duceretur: 'ex eo quod ille caro' significat quia corporeus factus: 'e erunt dies ejus centum et viginti anni' significat quod reliquiae fide ei esse debeant; 
estque praedictio de Ecclesia futura. </p>
