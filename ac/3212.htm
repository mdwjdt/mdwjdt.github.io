<h3 align="center" class="ired">属天的奥秘 第3212节</h3>
<h4 align="center"></h4><p><strong>3212.</strong> “以撒自从他母亲去世后，这才得了安慰”表一个新状态。这从“得了安慰”的含义清楚可知，“得了安慰”是指一个新状态，因为安慰的状态是一个新的状态。继前一个状态之后，该状态由“他母亲去世后”来表示。这个新状态就是理性的荣耀状态；理性因在良善方面早已得了荣耀，故现在是在真理方面得荣耀。当理性在良善与真理方面都变成神性时，它就得了荣耀。<br />就人性而言，主变成新的，即得了荣耀，或也可说，变成神性。凡沉浸于世俗和肉体爱欲中的人绝无可能想到这一点，因而也不会相信。因为他全然不知何为属灵或属天之物，甚至不愿知道。而凡没有沉浸于世俗和肉体爱欲中的人则能察觉到这一点，因为他相信主与父为一，一切神圣之物皆出自祂，因而祂甚至在人性方面也是神性。凡相信的人也会以自己的方式发觉这一点。<br />从人重生的状态可在某种程度上理解主荣耀的状态，因为人的重生是主荣耀的一个形像（<a href="3043.htm">3043</a>，<a href="3138.htm">3138</a>节）。当人正经历重生时，他变得和以前完全不同，并被作成新的。因此，他一旦重生，就被称作再生和新造者。那时，虽然他的脸面和言谈还是那样，但他的心智却不同了。一旦他重生，其心智就向天堂开放，对主之爱和对邻之仁，连同信仰都居于它里面。正是心智使得他成为不同的新人。这种状态的改变只能在人的灵里面，而无法在人体中被觉察到，因为身体只是其灵的覆盖物。一旦脱去这覆盖物，人的灵就会显现。事实上，只要他已重生，他的灵就具有完全不同的形式。这时，它是爱与仁的可见形式，具有无法形容的美丽（<a href="553.htm">553</a>节），而不再是先前仇恨与残忍的形式，该形式的丑陋同样是无法形容的。由此清楚可知何为重生之人，或再生者、新造者，也就是完全不同的新人。<br />通过该形像可在某种程度上对主的荣耀形成某种概念。祂不像人那样重生，而是变成神性，并且是通过神性之爱本身变成神性的，因为祂变成了神性之爱本身。当彼得、雅各和约翰被允许看到祂时，祂的形像便显现给他们。不过，他们是用灵眼而非肉眼看到的。也就是说，这时，祂的脸面明亮如日头（马太福音<a href="http://39-27.cn/太17.2.htm">17:2</a>）。从第5节经文，即“有声音从云彩里出来说，这是我的爱子”明显可知，这是祂的神性人。“子”是指神性人（参看<a href="2628.htm">2628</a>节）。</p>

And Isaac was comforted after his mother. That this signifies a new state, is evident from the signification of "receiving comfort," as being a new state; for a state of consolation is new; and that 
it succeeded to the foregoing is signified by "after his mother." This new state is the state of glorification of the rational; as before in respect to good, so now in respect to truth. The rational was 
glorified when it was made Divine in respect to both. [2] That the Lord as to the human was made new, that is, glorified (or what is the same, was made Divine), no one can possibly conceive (thus 
neither believe) who is in worldly and corporeal loves; for he is altogether ignorant what the spiritual and celestial is, nor indeed is he willing to know. But he who is not in worldly and corporeal 
loves, is capable of perceiving this, for he believes that the Lord is one with the Father, and that from Him proceeds all that is holy; consequently that He is Divine even as to the Human; and whoever 
believes, perceives in his own way.  [3] The state of the Lord's glorification may in some manner be conceived from the state of the regeneration of man, for the regeneration of man is an image of 
the glorification of the Lord (n. 3043, 3138). When man is being regenerated, he is then becoming altogether another, and is being made new; therefore also when he has been regenerated, he is called "born 
again," and "created anew." Then, although he has a similar face and a similar speech, yet his mind is not similar; his mind, when he is regenerate, is open toward heaven, and there dwells therein 
love to the Lord and charity toward his neighbor, together with faith. It is the mind that makes a man another, and a new man. This change of state cannot be perceived in the body of man, but in his 
spirit, the body being merely the covering of his spirit; and when it is put off, then his spirit appears, and this (provided he has been regenerated) in altogether another form, for it then has the 
form of love and charity in beauty inexpressible (n. 553), instead of its pristine form, which was that of hatred and cruelty with a deformity also inexpressible. This shows what a regenerate person is, 
or one who is born again, or created anew; namely, that he is altogether another, and is a new man. [4] From this image it may in some measure be conceived what the glorification of the Lord is. He 
was not regenerated as a man is; but became Divine, and this from the very Divine Love itself, for He was made the Divine Love itself. What his form then was, was made apparent to Peter, James, and 
John when it was given them to see Him, not with the eyes of the body but with the eyes of the spirit, namely-that His countenance shone like the sun (Matt. 17:2); and that this was His Divine Human is 
evident from the voice which then came out of the cloud, saying, "This is my beloved Son" (verse 5). That the "Son" is the Divine Human, may be seen above (n. 2628). </p>

'And Isaac was comforted after [the death of] his mother' means a new state. This becomes clear from the meaning of 'receiving comfort' as a new state, for a state of comfort is a new state, which, following 
the previous one, is meant by 'after his mother'. The new state is a state of glorification of the Rational; already so as to good, it now became glorified as to truth. The Rational was glorified 
when it became Divine as regards both good and truth. </p>
<p></p>
<p><b>[2]</b>
 As to the Human the Lord was made new, that is, was glorified, or what amounts to the same, was made Divine; but nobody can possibly grasp 
this, nor thus believe it, who is immersed in worldly and bodily loves. He has no knowledge at all of what spiritual or celestial is, and does not even wish to know. But anyone who is not immersed 
in worldly and bodily loves can perceive it, for he believes that the Lord is one with the Father, that everything holy comes from Him, and consequently that He is Divine even as regards the Human. 
And anyone who believes this perceives it in his own way. </p>
<p></p>
<p><b>[3]</b>
 The state of the Lord's glorification can be grasped to some extent from the state of man's regeneration, for man's regeneration is an 
image of the Lord's glorification, <a href="3043.htm">3043</a>, <a href="3138.htm">3138</a>. When a person is being regenerated he becomes completely different from before and is made new. Once he has been regenerated therefore he is called one who 
has been born again and created anew. At that point a person's face and speech remain the same, but not so his mind. Once he is regenerate his mind is open towards heaven, and love to the Lord and 
charity towards the neighbour, together with faith, reside in it. It is the mind that makes him a person who is different and new. Change of state cannot be discerned in a person's body, only in his spirit. 
The body is merely the covering for his spirit. When he lays aside the former his spirit is seen, and indeed in a form altogether different if he has been regenerated. In this case it is a visible 
form of love and charity that possesses beauty beyond description, <a href="553.htm">553</a>, replacing the previous form, which had been a visible form of hatred and cruelty possessing ugliness also beyond description. 
From this it may become clear what a regenerate person is, that is, one born again or created anew, namely one who is altogether different from before and who is new. </p>
<p></p>
<p><b>[4]</b>
 From this image one can 
have some conception of the Lord's glorification. He was not regenerated as man is but was made Divine, being made so from Divine love itself, for He was made Divine love itself. The nature of His form 
at that time was shown to Peter, James, and John when they were allowed to see Him not with their physical eyes but with those of the spirit, that is to say, on the occasion when His face shone like 
the sun, <a href="http://bible.gospelcom.net/cgi-bin/bible?passage=Matt%2017:2&amp;version=ESV&amp;interface=print&amp;showfn=yes&amp;showxref">Matt 17:2</a>. This was His Divine Human, as is clear from the voice which at that time declared from the cloud, 'This is My beloved Son', <a href="http://bible.gospelcom.net/cgi-bin/bible?passage=Matt%2017:5%20-&amp;version=ESV&amp;interface=print&amp;showfn=yes&amp;showxref">Matt 17:5 -</a> 'the Son' being the Divine Human, see <a href="2628.htm">2628</a>. </p>

`Et consolatus est Jishakus post matrem suam': quod significet statum novum, constare potest a significatione `consolationem accipere' quod sit status novus, status enim consolationis est novus, qui 
quod successerit priori, significatur per `post matrem suam.' Status novus est status glorificationis Rationalis, sicut prius quoad bonum, ita nunc quoad verum; Rationale glorificatum est, cum Divinum 
factum quoad utrumque. [2] Quod Dominus quoad Humanum novus factus, hoc est, glorificatus, seu quod idem {1}, Divinus, nusquam aliquis capere potest, ita nec credere, qui in mundanis et corporeis amoribus 
est; is quid sit spirituale et caeleste, prorsus nescit, et ne quidem scire vult; at qui non in mundanis et corporeis amoribus est, is percipere illud potest, credit enim quod Dominus sit unus 
cum Patre, et quod ab Ipso omne sanctum procedat; proinde quod Divinus sit etiam quoad Humanum, et qui credit, suo modo percipit: [3] status glorificationis Domini capi aliquo modo potest ex statu regenerationis 
hominis, nam regeneratio hominis est imago glorificationis Domini, n. 3043, 3138; cum homo {2}regeneratur, tunc fit prorsus alius, ac fit novus, ideo etiam cum regeneratus est, vocatur denuo 
natus, (c)et e novo creatus; tunc quamvis ei similis facies et similis loquela, usque non est similis mens; mens ejus cum regeneratus, est aperta versus caelum, (c)et inibi habitat amor in Dominum 
et charitas erga proximum cum fide, mens est quae hominem alium et novum facit, mutatio status non potest appercipi in hominis corpore sed in ejus spiritu; est corpus modo operimentum ejus spiritus; illud 
cum exuitur, tunc spiritus ejus apparet, et quidem prorsus alia forma cum regeneratus est; est ei tunc forma amoris et charitatis in pulchritudine inexpressibili, n. 553, loco prioris, quae fuit 
forma odii et crudelitatis cum deformitate etiam inexpressibili; exinde constare potest quid sit regeneratus, seu denuo natus, aut (c)a novo creatus, quod nempe prorsus alius {3}et novus; [4] ex hacimagine 
aliquatenus concipi potest quid glorificatio Domini; Ipse non regeneratus est sicut homo, sed Divinus factus, et hoc ex Ipsissimo Amore Divino, factus enim est Ipse Amor Divinus; qualis tunc {4}Ipsius 
forma fuit, apparuit Petro, Jacobo, et Johanni, cum Ipsum videre illis datum non oculis corporis sed oculis spiritus, nempe quod `splenduerit facies Ipsius sicut sol,' Matth. xvii 2; et quod hoc 
esset Divinum Humanum Ipsius, constat ex voce `quae tunc e nube, dicente, Hic est Filius Meus dilectus,' ibid vers. 5; quod `Filius' sit Divinum Humanum, videatur n. 2628. @1 i est$  @2 i reformatur
