<h3 align="center" class="ired">属天的奥秘 第872节</h3>
<h4 align="center"></h4><p><strong>872.</strong>“土地面上”就是居于该教会成员身上的那些事物，用“土地”来表述，是因为它是人成为一个教会所在的第一阶段。这一点从前面所阐述的“土地”的含义清楚可知。信之真理与良善被教会成员里面之时，他就被称为“土地”。在此之前，他被称为“陆地”，如创世记第一章，其中“陆地”指的是变得属天之前的人，而到了创世记第二章，当他变得属天时，就用“土地”和“田野”论及他。本章也一样。“陆地”和“土地”这两个词本身就足以使人意识到内义所表示的意思，不但此处是这样，在圣言中处处都是如此。从普遍意义上说，“土地”表教会，由于表教会，故也表教会成员，如前所述，教会的一切成员就是教会。</p>

<p><strong>[NCE]872.</strong> The face of the ground is what people in the church have in them, the word ground being used because this is a person's first stage in becoming a church. This can be seen from the symbolism of the ground (dealt with before [<a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_872/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_386" target=_top>386</a>, <a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_872/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_566" target=_top>566</a>]) as people in the church, who are referred to as the ground when the seed of faith's truth and goodness can be sown in them. Prior to that they are referred to as the land, or the earth. The first chapter of Genesis, for instance, speaking of a time before people have developed a heavenly character, uses land to describe them, but the second chapter, dealing with a time when they have become heavenly, uses ground and field to describe them. Something similar occurs in the present chapter.<br />The words land (or earth) and ground by themselves indicate what the symbolic meaning on the inner plane is, not just here but throughout the Word.<br />In an overall sense, the ground symbolizes the church; and because it symbolizes the church, it also symbolizes the people who belong to the church, since, as noted before [<a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_872/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_82" target=_top>82</a>], every individual in the church is a church. </p>

That the "faces of the ground" mean those things which are in the man of the church, and that the "ground" is mentioned because this is the first state when the man is becoming a church, is evident from 
the signification of "ground" (shown above), as being the man of the church, who is called "ground" when the goods and truths of faith can be sown in him, but before this he is called "earth." So 
in the first chapter of Genesis, before the man became celestial, "earth" is predicated of him; but when he became celestial, as described in the second chapter, "ground" and "field" are predicated of 
him. It is similar in the present chapter. Merely from the word "earth" and the word "ground" may be seen what is signified in the internal sense, not only here, but everywhere in the Word. By "ground" 
in the universal sense is signified the church; and because the church, the man of the church is also signified; for, as said before, each man of the church is a church. </p>

'The face<A name="fntext1"></a><A href="#fn1"><sup>a</sup></a> of the ground' means those things that reside with the member of the Church, and the expression 'the ground' is used because it is the first stage at which man comes to be the Church. This 
is clear from the meaning of 'the ground', dealt with already, as the member of the Church who is at that point called 'the ground' when the goods and truths of faith can be sown within him. Previously 
he is called 'the land', as in Genesis <a href="1.htm">1</a> where 'the land' refers to man prior to his becoming celestial, while Chapter <a href="2.htm">2</a>, when he has become celestial, refers to him as 'the ground' and 'the field'. 
It is similar in the present chapter. The expression 'the land' and the expression 'the ground' are sufficient by themselves to enable someone to recognize what is meant in the internal sense, not only 
here but also anywhere else in the Word. 'The ground' in the universal sense means the Church, and as the Church is meant so too is the member of the Church for, as stated already, every member of 
the Church is the Church.

</p><b>872.</b>
Quod 'facies humi' sint illa quae apud hominem Ecclesiae, et quod 'humus' dicatur, quia est primus status cum homo fit Ecclesia, constat a significatione humi, de qua prius, quod sit homo Ecclesiae, 
qui tunc 'humus' appellatur cum ei inseminari possunt bona et vera fidei; prius vocatur 'terra'; sicut in primo capite Geneseos, ubi antequam homo factus caelestis, de illo praedicatur terra, at cum 
factus caelestis, capite secundo, de illo praedicatur humus et ager; similiter in hoc capite. Solum ex voce 'terra' et voce 'humus,' conspici potest quid significatur in sensu interno, non solum hic sed 
etiam ubivis in Verbo: per 'humum' in sensu universali significatur Ecclesia, et quia Ecclesia, etiam significatur homo Ecclesiae, nam, ut prius dictum, unusquisque homo Ecclesiae est Ecclesia. </p>
