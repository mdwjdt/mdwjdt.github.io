<h3 align="center" class="ired">属天的奥秘 第1728节</h3>
<h4 align="center"></h4><p><strong>1728.</strong>“他是祭司”表爱的圣洁。这从圣言中“祭司”的含义清楚可知。称谓主的方式有两种，即主是王，主是祭司。王或王权表神性真理，祭司或祭司职份表神性良善。前者是神性属灵的，后者是神性属天的。作为王，主通过神性真理统治宇宙中的每一个事物；作为祭司，祂则通过神性良善进行统治。神性真理是其普遍王国的秩序本身，其一切法则就是真理，或永恒的真实；神性良善则是秩序的真正本质，其一切事物都是怜悯的表现。这二者（即神性良善与神性真理）都是主的属性。若唯独神性真理是祂的，那么凡人皆不得拯救，因为真理将每个人判入地狱。但神性良善，也就是怜悯的本质，会将每个人从地狱提升向天堂。在犹太教会中，诸王和祭司所代表的，就是神性真理和神性良善。麦基洗德作为撒冷王和至高神的祭司，也代表它们。</p>

<p><strong>[NCE]1728.</strong> And he was a priest symbolizes holy love, which can be seen from the symbolism of a priest in the Word.<br />Two roles are attributed to the Lord: king and priest.{*1} A monarch, or monarchy, symbolizes holy truth; a priest, or priesthood, symbolizes holy benevolence. Monarchy is divinely spiritual; priesthood is divinely heavenlike.<br />As sovereign, the Lord governs absolutely everything in the universe with divine truth; as priest he does so with divine benevolence.<br />Divine truth is the actual pattern for his entire kingdom, and all its laws are truths, or eternal realities. Divine benevolence is the vital essence itself of the pattern, and every bit of it is mercy. Both are attributed to the Lord. If divine truth were all there was, not a soul could be saved, since eternal truth damns everyone to hell. Divine benevolence, which is merciful, lifts everyone from hell to heaven.<br />This is what monarchs and priests represented in the Jewish church. It is also what Melchizedek represented as king of Salem and priest to God the Highest.<br /><br /><strong>Footnotes:</strong><br />{*1} For a brief historical perspective on Swedenborg's teachings regarding the roles of Christ, see Swedenborg [1771] 2006, page 721 note 288 [NCBSP: This is a reference to a work in the bibliography from the Swedenborg Foundation].

And he was priest. That this signifies the holy of love, is evident from the signification of "priest" in the Word. There are two things which are predicated of the Lord, namely, that He is King, and 
that He is Priest. A king, or the royalty, signifies the holy which is true; and a priest, or the priesthood, signifies the holy which is good; the former is the Divine spiritual, the latter the Divine 
celestial. The Lord as King governs each and all things in the universe from Divine truth; and as Priest, from Divine good. Divine truth is the very order of His universal kingdom, all the laws of 
which are truths, or eternal verities; Divine good is the very essential of order, all things of which are of mercy. Both of these are predicated of the Lord. If Divine truth alone were His, no mortal 
could be saved, for truths condemn everyone to hell; but Divine good, which is of mercy, uplifts from hell to heaven. These are what the kings and priests in the Jewish Church represented and these likewise 
Melchizedek represented, as king of Salem, and priest to God Most High. </p>

'And he was a priest' means the holiness of love. This is clear from the meaning of 'a priest' in the Word. Two special ways in which the Lord is characterized are as King and as Priest. A king or the 
office of king means holy truth, and a priest or the office of priest means holy good. The former is the Divine Spiritual, the latter the Divine Celestial. As King the Lord governs every single thing 
in the universe from Divine Truth; but as Priest He does so from Divine Good. Divine Truth is the order itself of His kingdom existing everywhere, all the laws of which are truths, or eternal verities. 
Divine Good is the very essential of order, every aspect of which is an expression of mercy. Both of these - Divine Good and Divine Truth- are attributed to the Lord. If solely Divine Truth were His, 
no mortal man could be saved, for truths condemn everyone to hell. But Divine Good, which is the essence of mercy, raises people up from hell towards heaven. Divine Truth and Divine Good are what 
kings and priests in the Jewish Church represented; and Melchizedek as king of Salem and priest to God Most High represented them too. </p>

</p><b>1728.</b>
'Et ille sacerdos': quod significet sanctum amoris, constat a significatione 'sacerdotis' in Verbo: sunt duo quae praedicantur de Domino, nempe quod sit Rex et quod sit Sacerdos; 'rex seu regium' significat 
sanctum verum, 'sacerdos seu sacerdotium' significat sanctum bonum; illud est Divinum spirituale, hoc Divinum caeleste. Dominus ut Rex gubernat omnia et singula in universo ex Divino Vero, ac 
ut Sacerdos ex Divino Bono: Divinum Verum est ipse ordo universi Regni Ipsius, cujus omnes leges sunt vera seu veritates aeternae; Divinum Bonum est ipsum essentiale ordinis, cujus omnia sunt misericordiae; 
utrumque praedicatur de Domino; si modo Divinum Verum, nullus mortalium salvari posset, nam veritates condemnant unumquemvis ad infernum; at Divinum Bonum quod est misericordiae, elevat ab inferno 
ad caelum. Haec sunt quae repraesentarunt reges et sacerdotes in Ecclesia Judaica; et quae quoque repraesentavit 'Malkizedech, ut rex Shalem, et sacerdos Deo Altissimo.' </p>
