<h3 align="center" class="ired">属天的奥秘 第1049节</h3>
<h4 align="center"></h4><p><strong>1049.</strong>“我便记念在我与你们之间所立的约”表主尤其怜悯已重生之人和能重生之人。这一点从前面所述可推知，因为对主而言，“记念”就是“怜悯”。记念无法被归于主，因为祂自永恒就知道每一个事物。但怜悯能被归于祂，因为祂知道这就是人的本性，即如前所述，人的自我中心是属地狱的，并构成他特有的地狱。人通过其自我中心的意愿与地狱相联；这自我中心通过地狱和它自己具有这样的特征，即人最大或最强烈的渴望就是一头扎进地狱；如此它仍不满足，还想把全世界所有人都扔下去。若由着自己，人的本性就是这样的魔鬼，主知道这一点，故可知，“记念所立的约”无非表示怜悯人，并通过神性手段使其重生，用大能将他引向天堂，只要人有这种可能性。</p>

<p><strong>[NCE]1049.</strong> The symbolism of and I will remember my pact, which is between me and you, as the Lord's mercy, specifically toward people who have been and people who can be reborn, also follows from all this, since remembering, for the Lord, is having mercy. The Lord cannot be said to remember, because he knows absolutely everything from eternity. Having mercy, though, is something he can be said to do, because he realizes what we humans are like. He knows that our self-centeredness reflects hell and is our actual hell, because our self-will keeps us in touch with hell. Self-will is such, on its own and by hell's inspiration, that its strongest, keenest wish is to throw itself headlong into hell; and it is not content with this but wants to drag everyone else in the universe along with it. Because this is the kind of devils we are on our own, and the Lord knows it, remembering the pact is consequently the same as showing mercy, using divine means to regenerate us, and drawing us to heaven with a powerful force, so far as our nature allows him to. </p>
<p align="center"><b>Potts(1905-1910) 1049</b></p><p><b>1049.</b>
And I will remember My covenant, which is between Me and you. That this signifies the mercy of the Lord, specifically toward the regenerate and those who can be regenerated, also follows, for, with the 
Lord, to "remember" is to have mercy. Remembering cannot be predicated of the Lord, because from eternity He knows all things both in general and in particular; but to have mercy is what is predicated 
of Him, because He knows that such is man's character-that is to say, as before said-that man's Own is infernal, and that it is his very hell. For by the Own of his will, man communicates with hell, 
and from hell and from itself this Own desires nothing so much and so strongly as to cast itself down into hell; nor is it content with this, but desires to cast down all in the universe. Since man 
of himself is such a devil, and the Lord knows this, it follows that His "remembering the covenant" means nothing else than having mercy on man, and by Divine means regenerating him, and drawing him 
to heaven by a mighty force, so far as the man is such as to render this possible. </p>

<p align="center"><b>Elliott(1983-1999) 1049</b></p><p><b>1049.</b>
'And I will remember My covenant which is between Me and you' means the Lord's mercy specifically towards those who have been regenerated, and those who are able to be. This too follows from what has 
been said above, for with the Lord 'remembering' is the same as showing mercy. The act of remembering cannot be attributed to the Lord since He knows from eternity every single thing. But having mercy 
can be attributed since He knows man's nature, namely that his proprium, as stated, is hell-like and constitutes his particular hell. For through the will side of his proprium he communicates with hell; 
and from hell and of itself that proprium is such that man has no greater or stronger desire than to plunge headlong into hell. Nor is he satisfied with that but desires [to take] everyone in the 
whole world [with him]. Because man of himself is by nature such a devil, and the Lord knows it, 'remembering the covenant' consequently means nothing else than having mercy, regenerating through Divine 
means, and by a mighty power drawing man towards heaven, insofar as he is such as to make this possible. </p>

</p><b>1049.</b>
'Et recordabor foederis Mei quod inter Me et inter vos': quod significet misericordiam Domini in specie erga regeneratos et qui regenerari possunt, etiam inde sequitur, nam 'recordari' apud Dominum 
est misereri; recordari non praedicari potest de Domino, quia ab aeterno omnia et singula novit, sed misereri, quia novit quod homo talis sit, nempe, ut dictum, quod proprium ejus sit infernale et quod 
sit ipsum ejus infernum, nam per proprium suum voluntarium communicat cum inferno, quod inde et ex se tale est ut nihil plus et potius cupiat quam in infernum se praecipitare, nec contentus est eo sed 
cupit omnes in universo {1}; homo quia ex se talis diabolus est, et Dominus hoc novit, sequitur quod 'recordari foederis' non aliud sit quam misereri, et per Divina media regenerare et ad caelum vi 
forti, quantum talis est homo ut possit, attrahere. 	@1 Perhaps printer omitted words such as secum praecipitare.$ </p>
