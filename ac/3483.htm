<h3 align="center" class="ired">属天的奥秘 第3483节</h3>
<h4 align="center"></h4><p><strong>3483.</strong>整个宇宙中可见的一切事物都是主国度的代表，以致凡存在于上面星空，或这个星球及其下面三个国度中的事物，无不以自己的方式成为代表。自然界中的每一个事物都是终极的形像，因为属于良善的属天之物从神性发出，属于真理的属灵之物从属天之物发出，而属世之物则从属天和属灵之物发出。由此明显可知，将自然界的力量与先于它们的流注，也就是它们的有效原因分开或隔离，然后将一切事物归于自然界的人类智慧何等愚蠢，甚至何等世俗和颠倒。凡以这种方式思想和言谈的人都觉得自己比谁都智慧，也就是说，这智慧就在于他们将一切事物都归于自然界。而天使的智慧恰恰相反，它不将任何事物归于自然界，而是将每一个事物都归于主的神性，因而归于生命，而不是任何死物。<br />学者都知道，持续存在就是永恒存在。然而，声称自然界的持续存在，如同它的最初存在一样来自主的神性，仍旧违背他们对虚假的情感，因而违背他们富有学问的名声。由于每一个事物都通过神性持续存在，也就是不断存在，并且来自这个源头的每一个事物必是真实事物的代表，而它通过真实事物存在，故可知，整个可见宇宙无非是代表主国度的一个舞台，而该国度则是代表主自己的一个舞台。</p>

Whatever is seen anywhere in the universe is representative of the Lord's kingdom, insomuch that there is not anything in the atmospheric and starry universe, or in the earth and its three kingdoms, 
which is not in its own manner representative. All things in nature, in both general and particular, are ultimate images, inasmuch as from the Divine are celestial things which are of good, from celestial 
things spiritual things which are of truth, and from both celestial and spiritual things are natural things. From this it is evident how gross, nay, how earthly and also inverted is that human intelligence 
which ascribes everything to nature separate or exempt from an influx prior to itself, or from an efficient cause. Moreover they who so think and speak seem to themselves to be wiser than others; 
that is, in attributing all things to nature, when yet on the contrary angelic intelligence consists in ascribing nothing to nature, but all and everything to the Divine of the Lord, thus to life, 
and not to anything dead. The learned know that subsistence is a perpetual coming forth; but still it is contrary to the affection of falsity and thence to a reputation for learning to say that nature 
continually subsists, as it originally came into existence, from the Divine of the Lord. Inasmuch therefore as each and all things subsist, that is, continually come forth, from the Divine, and as 
each and all things thence derived must needs be representative of those things whereby they came into existence, it follows that the visible universe is nothing else than a theater representative of 
the Lord's kingdom; and that this kingdom is a theater representative of the Lord Himself. </p>

<p align="center"><b>Elliott(1983-1999) 3483</b></p><p><b>3483.</b>
Everything at all visible in the universe is representative of the Lord's kingdom, so much so that nothing exists in the starry sky above, or on this planet and in its three kingdoms below, which is 
not in its own way representative. For every single thing within the natural order is an ultimate image, in that the Divine issues forth into celestial things, which are expressions of good; celestial 
things issue forth into spiritual, which are expressions of truth; and celestial and spiritual things issue forth into natural things. This shows how stupid, indeed how earthly and also topsy-turvy, 
human intelligence is which separates or isolates natural forces from that which is prior to them and flowing into them - that is, from their efficient cause - and then attributes everything to natural 
forces. And people who think and talk in this fashion seem to themselves to be wiser than anybody else, that is to say, by their attribution of everything to natural forces. Angelic intelligence however 
is quite the reverse - it attributes nothing to natural forces but every single thing to the Lord's Divine, and so to life, not to anything devoid of life. </p>
<p></p>
<p><b>[2]</b>
 The learned know that remaining 
in being consists in perpetual coming into being. Nevertheless it is contrary to their affection for falsity, and consequently to their reputation for being learned, to say that natural forces are constantly 
kept in being, even as they came into being, from the Lord's Divine. Now because every single thing remains in being from the Divine, that is, is constantly coming into being from Him, and every 
single thing from that source is inevitably a representative of the real thing by means of which it has come into being, the whole visible universe is therefore nothing else than a theatre that is 
representative of the Lord's kingdom. And this in turn is a theatre representative of the Lord Himself. </p>

</p><b>3483.</b>
Quicquid usquam apparet in universo, est repraesentativum regni Domini, usque adeo ut nihil usquam detur in universo {1}atmosphaerico et stellifero, in tellure et ejus tribus regnis, quod non suo modo 
repraesentat; sunt enim omnia et singula quae in natura, ultimae imagines; ex Divino enim sunt caelestia quae boni, ex caelestibus spiritualia quae veri, {2}ex illis et his naturalia. Inde constare 
potest quam crassa, immo quam terrestris et quoque inversa sit intelligentia humana quae naturae separatae seu exemptae ab influxu se priore, seu a causa efficiente, singula tribuit; qui etiam ita cogitant 
et loquuntur, sibi videntur prae ceteris sapere, {3}nempe tribuendo naturae omnia; cum vicissim intelligentia angelica sit, nihil naturae tribuere, sed omnia et singula Divino Domini, ita vitae, 
non alicui rei mortuae; [2] sciunt eruditi quod subsistentia sit perpetua existentia, sed usque est contra affectionem falsi et inde famam eruditionis, dicere quod subsistat continue natura, sicut exstiterat, 
(c)ex Divino Domini.  Quia nunc omnia et singula a Divino subsistunt, hoc est, continue existunt, et omnia et singula quae inde sunt, non {4}possunt aliter quam ut sint repraesentativa illarum 
rerum per quas exstiterant, sequitur quod universum aspectabile non aliud sit quam theatrum repraesentativum regni Domini, et quod hoc sit theatrum repraesentativum Ipsius Domini. @1 sidereo inque$ @2 
et ex spiritualibus$  @3 cum possint omnia naturae tribuere et Divino derogare$  @4 possint$  </p>
