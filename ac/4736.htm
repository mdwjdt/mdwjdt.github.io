<h3 align="center" class="ired">属天的奥秘 第4736节</h3>
<h4 align="center"></h4><p><strong>4736.</strong>“可以把他丢在这旷野的坑里”表他们可以暂时把它藏在他们的虚假当中，也就是说，他们可以视它为一个谎言，但仍要持有它，因为这对教会很重要。这从“坑”和“旷野”的含义清楚可知：“坑”是指虚假（参看<a href="4728.htm">4728</a>节）；“旷野”是指没有真理的地方。因为“旷野”这个词意义广泛，它表示无人居住，因而荒凉之地，当用来论及教会时，表示没有良善，从而没有真理之地（<a href="2708.htm">2708</a>，<a href="3900.htm">3900</a>节）。因此，“旷野的坑”在此表示在因没有良善而没有真理之处的虚假。之所以说“因没有良善而没有真理”，是因为如果有人认为没有行为的信仰能使人得救，那么真理可能确实存在，但却不是居于他里面的真理，因为它不关注良善，也不植根于良善。这种真理不是活的，因为它含有一个虚假原则在里面，因而对于拥有这种真理的人来说，它无非是一个基于在它里面掌权的虚假原则的谎言。这个原则就像灵魂，其余的从这灵魂拥有其生命。另一方面，如果良善在它们里面，尤其它是纯真的良善，如外邦人，甚至许多教会中人当中的良善，那么被当作真理接受的虚假就有可能存在。</p>

<p align="center"><b>Potts(1905-1910) 4736</b></p><p><b>4736.</b>
Cast him into this pit that is in the wilderness. That this signifies that they should conceal it meanwhile among their falsities, that is, that they should regard it as false, but still retain it because 
it was of importance to the church, is evident from the signification of a "pit," as being falsities (see n. 4728); and from the signification of a "wilderness," as being where there is no truth. 
For the word "wilderness" has a wide signification, it means where the land is uninhabited, and thus not cultivated; and when predicated of the church, it denotes where there is no good, and consequently 
no truth (n. 2708, 3900). Thus by a "pit in the wilderness" are here meant falsities in which there is no truth, because no good. It is said in which there is no truth because no good; for when 
anyone believes that faith saves without works, truth may indeed exist, but still it is not truth in him, because it does not look to good, nor is it from good. This truth is not alive, because it has 
in it a principle of falsity, consequently with anyone who has such truth, the truth is but falsity from the principle which rules in it. The principle is like the soul, from which the rest have their 
life. On the other hand there are falsities which are accepted as truths, when there is good in them, especially if it is the good of innocence, as with the Gentiles and also with many within the church. </p>

<p align="center"><b>Elliott(1983-1999) 4736</b></p><p><b>4736.</b>
'Throw him into [this] pit in the wilderness' means that for the time being they should conceal it among their falsities, that is, that they should consider it a falsehood but nevertheless keep it because 
it is of importance to the Church. This is clear from the meaning of 'the pit' as falsities, dealt with above in <a href="4728.htm">4728</a>, and from the meaning of 'the wilderness' as a place where there is no truth; 
for 'wilderness' has a wide range of meanings. It is a place that is uninhabited and so uncultivated, and when used to refer to the Church means a place where there is no good and consequently no truth, <a href="2708.htm">2708</a>, <a href="3900.htm">3900</a>. Thus 'the pit in the wilderness' is used here to mean falsities among which no truth is present because no good is there. </p>
<p></p>
<p><b>[2]</b>
 The expression 'no truth is present because no good is 
there' is used for the reason that if a person believes that faith saves without works, truth may indeed exist. Even so, it is not truth residing with him, because it does not look to good nor is it 
rooted in good. This truth is not a living one because it contains a false premise, and therefore when a truth of this kind exists with that person it is nothing but a falsehood based on the false premise 
that reigns within it. That premise may be likened to the soul from which all else has its life. On the other hand falsities can exist which are accepted as truths if good lies within them, especially 
if it is the good of innocence, as with gentiles and even with many within the Church. </p>

</p><b>4736.</b>
`Mittite eum ad foveam quae in deserto': quod significet quod absconderent interea inter sua falsa, hoc est, quod considerarent ut falsum, sed usque retinerent quia interest Ecclesiae, constat a 
significatione `foveae' quod sint falsa, de qua supra n. 2708; et a significatione `deserti' quod sit ubi non verum; `desertum' enim latae significationis est; est ubi inhabitatum ita non excultum, 
quod cum praedicatur de Ecclesia, est ubi non bonum et inde non verum, n. 2708, 3900; [2] ita per `foveam {1} in deserto' hic intelliguntur falsa in quibus non verum quia non bonum.  Dicitur in quibus 
non verum quia non bonum, cum enim fides creditur salvare absque operibus, tunc quidem dari potest verum, sed usque non est verum apud illum, quia non spectat bonum nec est a bono; id verum non 
vitale est quia in se habet principium falsi; proinde apud quem tale verum est, apud illum est id verum non aliter ac falsum ex principio quod inibi dominatur; principium est instar animae ex qua 
vita reliquis. Dantur vicissim falsa quae recipiuntur ut vera cum in illis est bonum, imprimis si bonum innocentiae, ut {2} apud gentiles et quoque apud plures intra Ecclesiam.      @1 quae$
