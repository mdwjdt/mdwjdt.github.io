<h3 align="center" class="ired">属天的奥秘 第10640节</h3>
<h4 align="center"></h4><p><strong>10640</strong>.“你要谨慎，恐怕你与你所去那地的居民立约”表不可依附于含有邪恶在里面的任何宗教。这从“立约”、“那地的居民”和“你所去的”的含义清楚可知：“立约”是指结合（参看<a href="10632.htm">10632</a>节提到的地方），因而 也指依附；“那地的居民”是指一种含有邪恶在里面的宗教，因为“居民”表示良善（<a href="2268.htm">2268</a>，<a href="2451.htm">2451</a>，<a href="2712.htm">2712</a>节），在反面意义上表示邪恶，而“地”表示教会和凡构成教会之物（参看<a href="9325.htm">9325</a>节提到的地方），因而也表示某种宗教；“你所去的”是指凡有某种含有邪恶在里面的宗教所在的地方，因为占据以色列民族即将所去的迦南地的各个民族表示邪恶和由它们所产生的虚假（参看刚才<a href="10638.htm">10638</a>节）。由此明显可知，“恐怕你与你所去那地的居民立约”表示不可依附于含有邪恶在里面的任何宗教。<br />由于这是当一个教会成员在阅读圣言时，用来光照他的主要事务之一，并且这也是接下来要论述的主题，所以有必要说一说此处是何情形。想要被主光照的人必须特别小心，不可将任何一种支持邪恶的教义当作自己的来接受。当一个人在自己的心智中确认或证实它时，他就将其变成了自己的，因为他由此将它变成自己信仰的一部分，如果他照之生活，更是如此。当这种情况发生时，邪恶仍旧铭刻于他的灵魂和内心；这种情况发生之后，他就不可能通过圣言从主那里获得任何光照。因为他的整个心智都充满了对他已经变成自己的基本观念的信和爱，凡违背这种观念的，他要么看不见，要么弃绝，要么歪曲。<br />例如：如果一个人以为自己唯独靠信得救，无论他过的是哪种生活，并在自己的心智中确认或证实这种观念，将其与他的其它一切教义结合在一起，以致他根本不思想生活，只思想信，那么以后无论他读多少遍圣言，都不会在其中看到与过一种良善的生活有关的任何东西。最终，他不知道何为良善，何为仁爱，何为爱；如果经上提到它们，他也会说，它们完全在于唯信。然而唯信，或没有它们的信，就像一个空虚的器皿，或像没有灵魂的东西。这样一个人的属灵生命可比作没有来自心脏的血液流入的肺呼吸；这根本不是生命，只不过像一幅画像或一个机器人的生命。说这些事，是为了叫人们知道对一个阅读圣言的人来说，情况是什么样，即：他若依附于任何一种支持邪恶的宗教，根本不可能从圣言获得任何光照。</p>

Take heed to thyself lest perchance thou make a covenant with the inhabitant of the land upon which thou comest. That this signifies that there must be no adherence to any religious persuasion whatever 
that has evil in it, is evident from the signification of "making a covenant," as being to be conjoined (see at the places cited in n. 10632), thus also to adhere; from the signification of "the inhabitant 
of the land," as being a religious persuasion that has evil in it, for by "inhabitant" is signified good (n. 2268, 2451, 2712), and consequently in the opposite sense evil; and by "land" is signified 
the church and whatever is of the church (see at the places cited in n. 9325); thus also a religious persuasion; and from the signification of "upon which thou comest," as being wherever there 
is a religious persuasion that has evil in it, for by the nations which were in the land of Canaan, into which they were to come, are signified evils and the derivative falsities (see just above, n. 
10638). From all this it is evident that by "lest thou make a covenant with the inhabitant of the land upon which thou comest," is signified that there must be no adherence to any religious persuasion 
whatever that has evil in it.  [2] As this is one of the primary things by means of which the man of the church is enlightened when he reads the Word, and as this is the subject treated of in what 
now follows, it shall be told how the case herein is. The man who wishes to be enlightened by the Lord must take especial care not to appropriate to himself any teaching that supports what is evil. A 
man appropriates it to himself when he confirms it with himself, for he thereby makes it of his faith, and still more so if he lives according to it. When this is done, the evil remains inscribed on his 
soul and on his heart. And when this has been done, he cannot possibly be afterward enlightened by the Word from the Lord, for his whole mind is in the faith and in the love of his principle, and whatever 
is contrary to it, he either does not see, or else rejects, or falsifies. [3] For example: he who believes that he is saved by faith alone whatever be the quality of his life, and has confirmed 
this with himself, and has conjoined it with all the rest of his doctrine, insomuch that he then thinks nothing about life, but only about faith, no matter how much he may read the Word, he afterward 
sees nothing therein about the good of life; and at last he does not know what good is, what charity, what love; and if these are mentioned he says that faith alone is all this; when yet faith alone, 
or faith without these, is like an empty vessel, and a thing without a soul. The spiritual life of such a man may be compared to the respiration of the lungs without any influx of blood from the heart; 
which is not life, except such as that of an image or an automaton. These things have been said in order that it may be known how the case is with the man who reads the Word, in that he cannot possibly 
be enlightened thereby if he has adhered to any religious persuasion which supports what is evil. </p>

'Take care, lest by chance you make a covenant with the inhabitants of the land onto which you come' means that there is to be no attachment to any sort of religion involving evil. This is clear from 
the meaning of 'making a covenant' as being joined together, dealt with in the places referred to in <a href="10632.htm">10632</a>, thus also becoming attached to; from the meaning of 'the inhabitants of the land' as a sort 
of religion involving evil, for good is meant by 'inhabitant', <a href="2268.htm">2268</a>, <a href="2451.htm">2451</a>, <a href="2712.htm">2712</a>, and in the contrary sense evil, while 'the land' means the Church and whatever constitutes the Church, dealt with in the 
places referred to in <a href="9325.htm">9325</a>, thus also some sort of religion; and from the meaning of 'onto which you come' as wherever some sort of religion involving evil exists, for the nations occupying the land 
of Canaan into which [the Israelites] were about to come mean evils and the falsities arising from them, see just above in <a href="10638.htm">10638</a>. From all this it is evident that 'lest you make a covenant with the 
inhabitants of the land onto which you come' means that there is to be no attachment to any sort of religion involving evil.  </p>

 Since this is one of the chief matters that serve to enlighten a member 
of the Church when he reads the Word, and since it forms the subject in what comes next, something must be said about what is implied by it. The person who wishes to be enlightened by the Lord must 
take special care not to embrace any matter of doctrine as his own if it lends support to evil. The person makes it his own when he corroborates it in his own mind, for by doing so he makes it part 
of his own beliefs, and all the more so if he lives by it. When this happens the evil remains inscribed on his soul and on his heart; and after that has happened he cannot possibly receive any enlightenment 
from the Lord through the Word. For his whole mind is permeated with a belief in and love of the fundamental idea he has made his own; and anything that goes against that idea he either fails 
to see, rejects, or falsifies. </p>
<p><b>[3]</b>
 Take for example a person who believes that he is saved by faith alone, irrespective of the kind of life he leads, and who has corroborated this idea in his own mind 
and linked it to all the other teachings he has adopted, to such an extent that he then gives no thought at all to life, only to faith. Afterwards, no matter how much that person reads the Word, he does 
not see anything in it that has to do with leading a good life. At length he is unaware of what good, charity, and love are; and if they are mentioned he says that they consist altogether in faith 
alone. Yet faith alone, or faith without them, is like an empty vessel or like something without a soul. The spiritual life of such a person may be compared to lungs breathing without blood flowing into 
them from the heart, which is not life at all, apart from being like that of an effigy or robot. These things have been stated in order that people may know what the situation is with a person who 
reads the Word - that he cannot receive any enlightenment at all from it if he has become attached to any sort of religion that lends support to evil.  </p>

`Cave tibi ne forte pangas foedus habitatori terrae super quam tu venis':  quod significet quod non adhaerendum religioso cuicumque in quo malum, constat ex significatione `pangere foedus' quod sit 
conjungi, de qua in locis citatis {1} n. 10632, ita quoque adhaerere; ex significatione `habitatoris terrae' quod sit religiosum in quo malum, per `habitatorem' enim significatur bonum, n. 2268, 2451, 
2712, et inde in opposito sensu malum, (c)et per `terram' significatur Ecclesia et quicquid Ecclesiae, in locis citatis n. 9325, ita quoque religiosum; et ex significatione `super quam tu venis' quod 
sit ubicumque religiosum in quo malum, per gentes enim quae in terra Canaane, in quam venturi, significantur mala et (d)inde falsa, videatur mox supra n. 10638; ex his patet quod per `ne pangas foedus 
habitatori terrae, super quam tu venis' significetur quod non adhaerendum religioso cuicumque in quo malum. 	[2] Quia hoc inter primaria est per quae homo Ecclesiae illustratur cum legit Verbum, et 
quia de hac re in nunc sequentibus agitur, dicetur quomodo cum illa se habet:  homo qui vult illustrari a Domino, imprimis cavebit ne appropriet sibi {2}aliquod doctrinale quod patrocinatur malum; homo 
tunc sibi appropriat id quando confirmat id apud se, nam per id facit illud suae fidei, et adhuc magis si vivit secundum (c)id; cum hoc fit, tunc malum manet inscriptum ejus animae et ejus cordi, et 
cum hoc factum est, (d)postea nequaquam potest illustrari per Verbum a Domino; mens enim ejus tota est in fide et in amore sui principii, et quicquid ei contrariatur, hoc vel non videt, vel rejicit, 
vel falsificat; {3}sit pro exemplo:  [3]qui credit per solam fidem salvari, qualiscumque vita sit, et hoc confirmavit apud se, et {4}conjunxit cum reliquis suae doctrinae, usque adeo ut dein nihil cogitet 
de vita sed solum de fide, is postea, utcumque legit Verbum, non videt aliquid ibi de bono vitae, et tandem non scit quid bonum, quid charitas, quid amor, quae si nominantur, dicit solam fidem esse 
omne id; cum tamen sola fides, seu fides absque illis est sicut vas vacuum {5}et sicut res absque anima; talis hominis vita spiritualis comparari potest respirationi pulmonum, absque influxu sanguinis 
e corde, quae non vita est, {6}nisi qualis simulacri seu automati; haec dicta sunt ut sciatur quomodo se habet cum homine qui legit Verbum, quod nequaquam inde illustrari possit si adhaeserit cuidam 
religioso quod patrocinatur malum. 1 i supra 2 aliquid 3 sicut 4 connexuit 5 est 6 hominum sed in externa forma vitae simulachrum </p>
