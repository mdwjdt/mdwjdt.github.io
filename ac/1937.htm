<h3 align="center" class="ired">属天的奥秘 第1937节</h3>
<h4 align="center"></h4><p><strong>1937.</strong>“服在她手下”表它应迫使自己服在内层真理的掌控之下。这是显而易见的，无需解释。“服”的原文是用表示“苦待”的词来表述的。“苦待自己”的内义是指强迫自己，这从圣言中的很多经文和下文可以看出来。人有必要强迫自己行善，顺服主的命令，言说真理。这就是“服在主母手下”所表示的，也就是说，要臣服于圣善与圣真的掌控。这句话所包含的奥秘不是几句话就能解释清楚的。<br />有些灵人活在世上时听说一切善皆来自主，人凭自己根本无法行出任何善事，于是就认定不在任何事上强迫自己，完全处于被动的状态。他们原以为自己所听到的是真的，他们所做的一切努力一点用也没有。结果，他们就等候直接流注进入其意愿的努力中，不再强迫自己行任何善事。事实上，当恶事悄悄溜进来时，他们从内心感受不到任何抵抗，甚至到了任由它摆布的程度，以为这样做也是可以的。但是，这些灵人仿佛丧失人格，没有任何主见，因而就在更没有用者之列。他们容许被恶者引领，就象容许被善者引领一样，并且受恶者影响多。<br />然而，那些强迫自己抵抗恶与假之人则不然。尽管一开始他们以为他们是自主或凭自己的力量这样做的，但后来受到启示，明白他们的努力，哪怕一丝一毫，全都来自主。这些人在来世不会被恶灵牵引，而是在受祝福者之列。由此可见，人应强迫自己行善事，说真理。其中所蕴含的奥秘是，人在这样做时会被主赐予天堂的自我，人的这种天堂自我是在其思维的努力中形成的。人若不通过自我强迫维持这种努力（如表面所显示的那样），必定会通过不自我强迫而不维持它。<br />为使这个问题更清楚明了，可以这样说：一切朝向良善的自我强迫里面都有某种自由，这自由在人操练自我强迫期间并没有被视为自由，但它仍存在于内。以为了某个目的而甘愿冒死亡危险，或为了健康甘愿忍受肉体疼痛之人为例。他们的行为中就有一种意愿和某种自由，尽管这些危险和疼痛在他身处其中时夺走他对这意愿或自由的感知。那些强迫自己行善之人也是如此：有一种意愿，因而有一种自由存在于他们里面，这就是其自我强迫的来源和理由；也就是说，他们这样做是为了顺服主的命令，为了死后灵魂的救赎。这其中还有一个更大的理由，尽管此人没有意识到它，那就是为了主的国度，甚至为了主自己。<br />处于试探中的绝大多数人都是这种情形。在这些试探中，当此人迫使自己抵抗恶灵所注入并暗示的恶与假时，会有一种更为自由的状态存在，这种自由不可能存在于试探之外的任何状态中，尽管当时这人无法理解它。这是一种内在自由，它会在这个人里面产生征服邪恶的意愿，并且如此强大，足以与攻击他的恶者的力量权能相抗衡。否则，他根本不能应战。这自由来自主，祂将其注入到此人的良知中，并通过这自由使他战胜邪恶，仿佛他这样做是凭他自己。人通过这自由获得一个主能将良善施加于其中的自我。没有所获得的一个自我，即没有通过自由被赋予的一个自我，没人能被改造，因为他无法接受新的意愿，也就是良知。被如此赋予的自由才是主的善与真所流入的那个层面。因此，处于试探中的人若不凭着所赋予他们的意愿或自由进行抵抗，就会一败涂地。<br />一切自由里面都有人的生命，因为其中有他的爱。凡人出于爱所做的，在他看来都是自由的。不过，当这个人迫使自己抵抗恶与假，并行善时，这自由里面就会有天堂之爱。那时，主会注入这天堂之爱，并通过它创造此人的自我。所以，主愿意这自我在人看来如同他自己的，尽管事实上并非他的。人活在肉身期间貌似通过强制手段所得来的这个自我，在来世会被主充满无穷的快乐、幸福。这种人也会逐渐得到启示，确切地说，逐渐明白，甚至确认这一真理：他们凭自己根本没有一顶点的自我强迫，其意愿所努力的一切事，哪怕最小的，一直来自主。他们还被引导明白为何他们的自我强迫看似出于他们自己的原因，这是为了主可以赋予他们一个如同他们自己的新意愿，并且天堂之爱的生命能以这种方式被归给他们。因为主愿意与每个人分享祂的东西，因而愿意分享天堂之物，以致它看似是这个人的，就在他里面，尽管并非他的。天使就具有这样的自我，他们越接受这一真理，即一切善与真皆来自主，就越处在这自我的快乐、幸福之中。<br />然而，人若鄙视并弃绝一切善与真，不愿相信与其恶欲和推理相冲突的任何事，就不会强迫自己，因而不会接受这良知的自我，或新意愿。由上述内容也明显可知，自我强迫并不等于被强迫，因为良善从来不出自强迫，如当一个人被另一个人强迫行善时的情形。但显然，我们在此所讨论的自我强迫出自此人所不知的某种自由，因为主从来不是任何强迫的来源。由此便有了这样一条普遍法则：一切善与真之物都是在自由中被植入的。否则，土地不可能接受并抚育良善之物，事实上，能使这种子生长的土地并不存在。</p>

<p align="center"><b>Potts(1905-1910) 1937</b></p><p><b>1937.</b>
Humble thyself under her hands. That this signifies that it ought to compel itself to be under its sovereign power, is evident without explication. "To humble oneself" is expressed in the original tongue 
by a word which signifies "to afflict." That "to afflict oneself" is, in the internal sense, to compel oneself, may be seen from very many passages in the Word, and will be treated of in what follows. 
That man ought to compel himself to do what is good, to obey the things commanded by the Lord, and to speak truths, which is to "humble himself under" the Lord's hands, or to submit himself to the 
sovereign power of the Divine good and truth, involves more arcana than can be explained in a few words.  [2] There are certain spirits who during their life in the world, because they had been told 
that all good is from the Lord, and that a man can do nothing of himself, had held it as a principle not to compel themselves in anything, but to cease from all effort, thinking that as the case was 
so, all effort would be in vain; and therefore they had waited for immediate influx into the effort of their will, and did not compel themselves to do anything good, going so far that when anything 
evil crept in, as they felt no resistance from within, they resigned themselves to it also, supposing that it was permissible to do so. But these spirits are as it were devoid of what is their own, so 
that they have no determination to anything, and are therefore among the more useless, for they suffer themselves to be led alike by the evil and by the good, and suffer much from the evil.  [3] But 
they who have compelled themselves to resist what is evil and false-although at first they supposed that this was from themselves or from their own power, but were afterwards enlightened to see that 
their effort was from the Lord, even to the least of all the particulars of the effort-these in the other life cannot be led by evil spirits, but are among the happy. Thus we may see that a man ought 
to compel himself to do what is good and to speak what is true. The arcanum herein contained is that a man is thus gifted by the Lord with a heavenly Own, for this heavenly Own of man is formed in the 
effort of his thought; and if he does not maintain this effort by compelling himself (as the appearance is), he certainly does not maintain it by not compelling himself.  [4] That we may see how this 
is, let it be observed that in all self-compulsion to what is good there is a certain freedom, which is not discerned as such while the man is engaged in this self-compulsion, but still it is within. 
For instance, in one who is willing to undergo the risk of death for the sake of a certain end, or in one who is willing to suffer bodily pain for the sake of health, there is a willingness and thus 
a certain freedom from which the man acts, although the dangers and the pains, while he is in them, take away his perception of this willingness or freedom; and such is the case also with those who compel 
themselves to do what is good: there is a willingness within, and thus a freedom, from which and for the sake of which they compel themselves, that is to say, they do so for the sake of obedience 
to what the Lord has commanded, and for the sake of the salvation of their souls after death, within which although the man is not aware of it, there is still more interiorly a regard for the Lord's 
kingdom, and even for the Lord Himself.  [5] This is the case most of all during temptations, for in these-when the man compels himself to resist the evil and falsity which are infused and suggested 
by evil spirits, there is more of freedom than is possible in any state out of temptations-although at the time the man cannot comprehend this-for there is an interior freedom, from which he wills to 
subjugate evil, and which is so great as to equal the force and strength of the evil that is assailing him, for otherwise he could not possibly wage the combat. This freedom is from the Lord, who insinuates 
it into the man's conscience, and by means of it causes him to overcome the evil as from what is his own. Through this freedom man acquires an Own in which the Lord can work what is good. Without 
an Own acquired, that is, given, through freedom, no man can possibly be reformed, because he cannot receive the new will, which is conscience. The freedom thus given is the very plane into which 
there is an influx of good and truth from the Lord. Hence it is that they who in temptations do not resist from their own will, or in freedom, give way.  [6] In all freedom there is man's life, because 
there is his love. Whatever a man does from love appears to him free. But in this freedom, when the man is compelling himself to resist what is evil and false, and to do what is good, there is heavenly 
love, which the Lord then insinuates, and through which He creates the man's Own; and therefore the Lord wills that it should appear to the man as his, although it is not his. This Own which man 
during his bodily life thus receives through what is apparently compulsory, is filled by the Lord in the other life with illimitable delights and happinesses. Such persons are also by degrees enlightened 
to see and even to be confirmed in the truth, that of themselves they have not compelled themselves one atom, but that all things of the effort of their will, even the smallest, had been from the 
Lord; and that the reason why it had appeared as if it was of themselves was in order that a new will might be given them by the Lord as their own, and that in this way the life of heavenly love might 
be appropriated to them. For the Lord wills to communicate to everyone what is His, and therefore He wills to communicate what is heavenly, so that it may appear as the man's, and in him, although it 
is not his. The angels are in such an Own; and in proportion as they are in the truth that all good and truth are from the Lord, they are in the delight and happiness of this Own.  [7] But they who 
despise and reject all good and truth, and who are willing to believe nothing that is repugnant to their cupidities and reasonings, cannot compel themselves; and thus cannot receive this Own of conscience, 
or new will. From what has been said above it is also evident that to compel oneself is not to be compelled; for no good ever comes from compulsion, as when a man is compelled by another man to 
do what is good; but it is evident that in the case we are now considering the self-compulsion comes from a certain freedom that is unknown to the man, since from the Lord there is never any compulsion. 
Hence it is a universal law that all that which is good and true is inseminated in freedom, for otherwise the ground cannot possibly receive and cherish that which is good, and in fact there is no 
ground in which the seed can grow.  </p>

<p align="center"><b>Elliott(1983-1999) 1937</b></p><p><b>1937.</b>
That 'humble yourself beneath her hands' means that it ought by self-compulsion to place itself under the controlling power of that interior truth is clear without explanation. In the original language 
'humbling oneself' is expressed by means of a word which means to fling down. That 'flinging oneself down' in the internal sense is compelling oneself becomes clear from very many places in the Word, 
the meaning of which will be dealt with later on. The need for the individual to compel himself to do good, to obey what the Lord has commanded, and to utter truths, meant by 'humbling herself beneath 
her mistress's hands', that is, submitting oneself beneath the controlling power of Divine good and truth, comprehends more arcana within itself than can be explained briefly. </p>
<p></p>
<p><b>[2]</b>
 There are certain 
spirits who during their lifetime, having heard that all good originated in the Lord and that man was unable from himself to perform any good at all, had for these reasons held to a principle of 
not compelling themselves in anything and of remaining utterly passive; for they had supposed that, what they had heard being true, any effort at all made by them was totally ineffectual. They had therefore 
waited for immediate influx into the effort of their will and had not compelled themselves to do anything good. Indeed when anything evil had crept in, since they did not feel from within any resistance 
to it, they had gone so far as to abandon themselves to it, imagining that it was permissible to do so. But those spirits are such that they do not possess so to speak any selfhood, and so do 
not possess any mind of their own, and are therefore among the more useless; for they suffer themselves to be led just as much by the evil as by the good, and suffer much from the evil. </p>
<p></p>
<p><b>[3]</b>
 But those 
who have practiced self-compulsion and set themselves against evil and falsity - even though at first they had imagined that they did so of themselves, or by their own power, but had after that been 
enlightened to the effect that their effort originated in the Lord, even the smallest of all the impulses of that effort - in the next life cannot be led by evil spirits, but are among the blessed. 
This shows that a person ought to compel himself to do what is good and to speak what is true. The arcanum Lying within this is that in so doing a person has a heavenly proprium bestowed on him from 
the Lord. This heavenly proprium is formed within the effort of his thought; but if he does not maintain that effort through self-compulsion - as this appears to be the way it is maintained - he does 
not by any means do so by abstaining from self-compulsion. </p>
<p></p>
<p><b>[4]</b>
 To make this matter clearer let it be said that within all compulsion towards what is good a certain freedom exists, which is not recognized 
as freedom while a person is exercising self-compulsion, but is nevertheless inwardly present. Take for example one who is willing to risk death for the sake of some particular end, or one who 
is willing to endure physical pain for the sake of his health. There is a willingness and so a certain freedom in those actions, though while he is taking risks or suffering pain these remove any feeling 
of willingness or freedom. So also with those who compel themselves to do what is good. Present within them there is a willingness and thus freedom, which is the source of and the reason for their 
self-compulsion. That is to say, they compel themselves for the reason that they may obey the things which the Lord has commanded and that their souls may become saved after death; and within these 
a still greater reason is present, though the person himself is not aware of it, namely the Lord's kingdom, and indeed the Lord Himself. </p>
<p></p>
<p><b>[5]</b>
 This applies most of all in times of temptation. In these, 
when a person practices self-compulsion and sets himself against the evil and falsity that are implanted and prompted by' evil spirits, more freedom is present than there would ever be in any state 
outside those times of temptation, though the person cannot comprehend it then. It is an interior freedom, which produces in him the will to subdue evil and which is great enough to match the power and 
might of the evil assailing him; otherwise he would not be able to fight at all. This freedom comes from the Lord who implants it in his conscience and by means of it causes him to overcome evil as 
though he did so from his own proprium. By means of that freedom the person receives a proprium into which the Lord is able to exert good. Without a proprium acquired, that is, conferred, by means of 
freedom, no one can possibly be reformed, since he is unable to receive a new will, which is conscience. The freedom so conferred is the actual plane into which the influx of good and truth from the 
Lord passes. Consequently people who in times of temptation do not put up any resistance from that will or freedom conferred on them go under. </p>
<p></p>
<p><b>[6]</b>
 Present in all freedom is a person's life, because 
present there is his love. Whatever a person does from love appears to him as freedom. But within that freedom, when the person practices self- compulsion, setting himself against evil and falsity and 
doing what is good, heavenly love is present which the Lord instills at that time and by means of which He creates that person's proprium. It is the Lord's will therefore that this proprium should appear 
to the person to be his own, though in fact it is not. This proprium which a person receives in this manner during his lifetime by means, as it seems, of compulsion, the Lord replenishes in the 
next life with limitless forms of delight and happiness. Such people are also by degrees enlightened, or rather are confirmed, in the truth that their self-compulsion has not commenced at all in themselves 
but that even the smallest of all the impulses of their will has been received from the Lord. They are also led to see that the reason why their compulsion had appeared to commence in themselves 
was that the Lord might give them a new will as their own, and in this way the life belonging to heavenly love might be imparted to them as their own. Indeed the Lord's will is to share with everyone 
that which is His, thus that which is heavenly, so that it may appear to be that person's and to be within him, though in fact it is not his. A proprium such as this exists with angels, and insofar as 
they accept the truth that everything good and true comes from the Lord the delight and happiness belonging to such a proprium exist with them. </p>
<p></p>
<p><b>[7]</b>
 People however who despise and reject everything 
good and true and who are unwilling to believe anything that conflicts with their evil desires and their reasonings are unable to compel themselves and so are unable to receive this proprium imparted 
to conscience, that is, to receive a new will. From what has been stated above it is also evident that self-compulsion is not the same as being compelled, for no good ever results from being compelled, 
as when one person is being compelled by another to do good. What is being discussed here is self-compulsion which is the product of a certain freedom unknown to the individual, for the Lord is never 
the source of any compulsion. From this comes the universal law that everything good and true is implanted in freedom. Otherwise the ground never becomes receptive and able to foster what is good; 
indeed there is no ground for the seed to grow in. </p>

</p><b>1937.</b>
Quod `humilia te sub manibus illius' significet quod se cogere debeat ut sit sub illius potestate, constat absque explicatione: `humiliare se' exprimitur in lingua originali per vocem quae significat 
affligere; {1}quod (t)se affligere in sensu interno sit (t)se cogere, ex plurimis in Verbo locis constare potest, de qua ejus significatione in sequentibus. Quod homo se cogere debeat ad faciendum bonum, 
ad oboediendum illis quae a Domino mandata sunt, et ad loquendum vera, quod est ad (t)humiliandum se sub manibus dominae, seu ad se submittendum sub potestate boni et veri Divini, plura arcana involvit 
quam ut paucis possit explicari;  [2] sunt quidam spiritus qui pro principio habuerunt dum vixerunt in mundo, quod quia audiverunt omne bonum esse a Domino, et hominem nihil boni a se facere posse, 
se nihil coegerint, sed {2}se remiserint, irritum fore omnem conatum putantes, quia ita est, et ideo exspectaverint immediatum influxum in voluntatis eorum conatum, nec se ad faciendum aliquod bonum 
coegerint; immo usque adeo ut dum aliquod malum irrepserit, quod quia non senserunt aliquem renisum ab interiore, se quoque ei reliquerint, putando sic permissum fore; sed ii tales sunt ut sint quasi 
absque proprio, sic ut sint nullius determinationis, quare inter inutiliores, duci enim se patiuntur aeque a {3}malis ac a bonis, et a malis multum patiuntur;  [3] at qui se coegerunt contra malum 
et falsum, tametsi primum putarunt quod hoc esset a se seu a propria potentia, at postea illustrati quod conatus eorum fuerit a Domino, immo omnium minima conatus, ii in altera vita non possunt duci 
a (t)malis spiritibus, sed inter felices sunt: exinde constare potest quod homo se cogere ad faciendum bonum et loquendum verum debeat; arcanum quod in eo latet, est quod sic donetur homo proprio caelesti 
a Domino; proprium caeleste hominis formatur in ejus cogitationis conatu, quem si non per se cogere, sicut apparet, nusquam per se non cogere, obtinet; [4] ut hoc pateat quomodo se habet, in omni 
coactione ad bonum est liberum quoddam, quod non ita appercipitur cum in coactione est, sed usque inest; sicut qui vult subire discrimina mortis propter finem {4}quendam, aut sicut qui vult pati dolores 
corporis propter sanitatem, est voluntarium, et sic liberum quoddam in illis, ex quo id facit, tametsi discrimina et dolores dum in illis est, auferant apperceptionem voluntarii seu liberi; ita se 
habet cum illis qui se ad bonum cogunt, est intus voluntarium, ita liberum, ex quo et propter quod se cogunt, nempe propter oboedientiam illorum quae Dominus mandavit, et propter salutem animae suae 
post mortem, in quibus adhuc interius est, quod homo non novit, propter regnum {5}Domini, immo propter Ipsum Dominum;  [5] hoc fit quam maxime in tentationibus, in quibus cum se cogit homo contra malum 
et falsum quod infunditur et suggeritur a malis spiritibus, plus liberi est quam usquam in aliquo statu {6}extra tentationes, quamvis homo id non tunc capere potest; est liberum interius, ex quo vult 
subjugare malum,(m) et in tantum ut aequivaleat vi et fortitudini mali quod impugnat,(n) alioquin nusquam pugnaret: hoc liberum est a Domino, Qui illud ejus conscientiae insinuat et per illud facit 
ut vincat malum, sicut ex proprio; per hoc liberum accipit homo proprium, in quod Dominus operari potest bonum; absque proprio per liberum acquisito, hoc est, donato, nusquam aliquis homo reformari potest, 
quia non novam voluntatem quae est conscientia, accipere potest; liberum sic donatum est ipsum planum in quod influxus boni et veri a Domino; inde est, qui non ex illo voluntario seu libero in 
tentationibus resistunt, quod succumbant; in omni libero est vita hominis, quia est amor ejus; quicquid homo ex [6] amore facit, hoc liberum ei apparet; {7}at in libero illo, cum homo se cogit contra 
malum et falsum et ad faciendum bonum, est amor caelestis quem Dominus tunc insinuat et per quem ejus proprium creat, quare vult Dominus ut illud appareat homini sicut ejus tametsi non sit ejus; hoc proprium 
quod ita accipit per apparens coactum in vita corporis, Dominus in altera vita implet indefinitis jucundis et felicibus, ii quoque illustrantur per gradus, immo confirmantur in illa veritate quod 
ne hilum se a semet coegerint, sed quod omnium minima conatus voluntatis eorum fuerint a Domino; (m)et quod apparuerit sicut (c)a semet, quod causa fuerit ut daretur illis a Domino novum voluntarium 
sicut eorum et sic appropriaretur illis vita amoris caelestis; Dominus enim vult unicuique communicare quod Ipsius est, ita caeleste, ut appareat sicut ejus ac in eo tametsi non ejus sit; angeli in 
tali proprio sunt, et quantum in illo vero quod a Domino omne bonum et verum, tantum in proprii illius jucundo et felici.(n) [7] Qui autem omne bonum et verum contemnunt et rejiciunt, et qui volunt nihil 
credere quod repugnat eorum cupiditatibus {8}et ratiociniis, ii non possunt se cogere,{9} ac ita non possunt proprium hoc conscientiae {10}seu novum voluntarium accipere.  (m)Ex supradictis etiam 
patet quod se cogere non sit cogi, nam ex cogi nusquam aliquod bonum, ut fit cum homo ab alio homine ad bonum agendum cogitur, sed quod hic se cogere sit ex libero quodam ei ignoto, nam a Domino nusquam 
aliquod coactum; inde {11}est lex universalis, quod omne bonum et verum inseminetur in libero, alioquin humus nusquam fit recipiens et fovens boni, immo non aliqua humus in qua semen crescere possit.(n) @1
