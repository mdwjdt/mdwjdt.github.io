<h3 align="center" class="ired">属天的奥秘 第6611节</h3>
<h4 align="center"></h4><p><strong>6611.</strong>我曾与灵人谈论过人生命的状态变化，说，它并非恒定不变，而是起起伏伏，也就是说，时而被提上天堂，时而被下入地狱。但那些允许自己重生的人不断被往上提，从而总是进入越来越内在的天堂社群。主使得那些正在重生之人，尤其那些通过试探正在重生之人的气场延伸到这些社群；在试探期间，邪恶和虚假遭到抵制；因为那时主通过天使与邪恶和虚假争战；人以这种方式被引入这些天使的更内在的社群。一旦被引入这些社群，他就会留在那里；他由此也会接受更广、更高的觉知能力。</p>

<p align="center"><b>Potts(1905-1910) 6611</b></p><p><b>6611.</b>
I have spoken with spirits about the changes of state of man's life, that it is inconstant, and that he is borne upward and downward, now toward heaven and now toward hell. But they who suffer themselves 
to be regenerated are being borne continually upward, and thus always into more interior heavenly societies. Extension of sphere into these societies is given by the Lord to those who are being regenerated, 
especially to those who are being regenerated by means of temptations, in which resistance is made to evils and falsities; for the Lord then fights through angels against the evils and falsities; 
and in this way the man is introduced into the societies of these angels, which are more interior societies; and into whatever societies he has once been introduced, he there remains; and from 
this he also receives a more extended and elevated capacity of perception. </p>

I have talked to spirits about the changes of state that a person's life undergoes, saying that it does not remain constant but that it involves ups and downs, that is to say, being taken up to heaven 
and down to hell. But people who allow themselves to be regenerated are being carried ever upwards, thus into heavenly communities that are always more internal. The Lord enables the sphere of those 
who are being regenerated to extend into those communities primarily by means of temptations, in which evils and falsities are being withstood. For during temptations the Lord fights by means of angels 
against evils and falsities, and in this way a person is led into the more internal communities of these angels. Once he has been led into them he remains there; and this also gives him a broader and 
loftier ability to perceive. </p>

</p><b>6611.</b>
Locutus sum cum spiritibus de mutationibus status vitae hominis, quod sit inconstans, et quod feratur sursum et deorsum, nempe versus caelum et versus infernum; at qui se patiuntur regenerari, quod 
ferantur continue sursum, ac ita in interiores semper societates caelestes; extensio sphaerae in societates illas a Domino datur illis qui regenerantur imprimis per tentationes, in quibus resistitur malis 
et falsis, nam pugnat tunc Dominus per angelos contra mala et falsa, et sic in angelorum illorum societates quae interiores sunt, homo introducitur; et {1}in quas semel introductus est, ibi manet; 
et inde quoque accipit facultatem extensiorem et elevatiorem percipiendi. @1 ad$ </p>
