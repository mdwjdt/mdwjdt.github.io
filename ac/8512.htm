<h3 align="center" class="ired">属天的奥秘 第8512节</h3>
<h4 align="center"></h4><p><strong>8512.</strong>“耶和华对摩西说”表神性的显现已经变得模糊。这从“耶和华说”的含义清楚可知，“耶和华说”包含接下来的话，即：他们不守祂的诫命和律法，因此神性在他们中间的显现变得模糊。当人们不照神的诫命生活时，这种事就会发生；因为当人们照诫命生活时，他们就是照着神性秩序生活，因为神的诫命就是符合或源于秩序的真理和良善。当人们照秩序生活时，他们就在主里面生活并居住，因为主是秩序本身。由此可推知，不照属神性秩序的诫命和律法生活的人都不在主里面生活并居住，因此可推知，对此人来说，这时神性变得模糊。照秩序生活在此是指通过良善被主引导；而尚未照秩序生活是指通过真理被引导；当人通过真理被引导时，主不向他显现。因此，这时此人在黑暗中行走，在黑暗中是看不见真理的。当人通过良善被引导时，情况就不同了；那时，他在光中行走，在光中则看得见真理。关于这些事，可参看刚才的阐述（<a href="8505.htm">8505</a>，<a href="8506.htm">8506</a>，<a href="8510.htm">8510</a>节）。</p>

And Jehovah said unto Moses. That this signifies the appearing of the Divine obscured, is evident, from the signification of "Jehovah said," as involving what follows, here that they did not keep His 
commandments and laws, thus that the appearing of the Divine among them was obscured. For this takes place when anyone does not live according to the Divine commandments; because when anyone does live 
according to them, he lives according to Divine order, inasmuch as the Divine commandments are truths and goods which are in conformity with order; and when anyone lives according to order, he then 
lives in the Lord, because the Lord is order itself. From this it follows that he who does not live according to the commandments and laws which are of Divine order, does not live in the Lord, consequently 
that then the Divine is obscured with him. By living according to order is here meant to be led by the Lord through good, but to live not as yet according to order is to be led through truth; and 
when man is led through truth, the Lord does not appear to him; and therefore the man then walks in the dark, in which he does not see good. It is different when a man is led through good. He then sees 
in the light. </p>

'And Jehovah said to Moses' means that the appearance of the Divine had become obscured. This is clear from the meaning of 'Jehovah said', which includes what comes after it, namely the accusation that 
they were not keeping the commandments and laws, thus that for them the appearance of the Divine had become obscured. This happens when people do not live lives in keeping with God's commandments; 
for when people's lives are in keeping with them they are in keeping with Divine order, because God's commandments are truths and forms of good that originate in order. And when people live lives in keeping 
with order they live and abide in the Lord, because the Lord is true order. From this it follows that anyone who does not live a life in keeping with the commandments and laws that belong to Divine 
order does not live and abide in the Lord, and the consequence for that person is that the Divine becomes obscured. By living a life in keeping with order one should here understand being led by 
the Lord through good. But by living a life not as yet in keeping with order one should understand being led through truth; and when a person is led through truth the Lord does not appear. Therefore also 
at this time the person walks in darkness, in which he does not see truths. It is different when a person is led through good; then he walks in the light, in which he does see truths. Regarding these 
matters, see what has been stated just above in <a href="8505.htm">8505</a>, <a href="8506.htm">8506</a>, <a href="8510.htm">8510</a>. </p>

`Et dixit Jehovah ad Moschen': quod significet apparentiam Divini obscuratam, constat ex significatione `dixit Jehovah' quod involvat sequentia, hic quod non custodirent praecepta et leges, ita quod 
apparentia Divini apud illos obscuraretur; hoc enim fit cum non vivitur secundum {1}praecepta Divina, cum enim vivitur secundum illa, tunc vivitur secundum ordinem Divinum, nam praecepta {2}Divina sunt 
vera et bona quae ex ordine; et cum vivitur secundum ordinem, tunc vivitur in Domino, nam Dominus est ipse ordo; inde sequitur quod qui non vivit secundum praecepta et leges quae sunt ordinis Divini 
non vivat in Domino, consequenter quod tunc apud illum obscuretur Divinum.  Per vivere secundum ordinem hic intelligitur duci a Domino per bonum, at per vivere nondum secundum ordinem est {3}duci per 
verum; et cum ducitur homo per verum, {4} Dominus non apparet; quapropter etiam tunc homo {5} vadit in tenebris, in quibus non videt {6}vera, {7}aliter cum homo ducitur per bonum, tunc {8}vadit in luce, 
in qua videt vera; de his videantur quae mox supra n. 8505, 8506, 8510, dicta sunt. 	@1 illa, sed contra illa$ 	@2 et leges$ 	@3 After verum$ 	@4 i tunc$ 	@5 i quasi$ 	@6 bonum IT$ 	@7 at$ 	@8
