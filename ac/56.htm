<h3 align="center" class="ired">属天的奥秘 第56节</h3>
<h4 align="center"></h4><p><strong>56.</strong>创世记1:29 神说：“看哪，我将遍地上一切结种子的草本和一切结果子的树全赐给你们，一切结有核的树将作为你们的食物。”<br />属天之人唯以属天的事物为乐，这些与他的生命相称，故被称为“属天的食物”；属灵之人以属灵的事物为乐，这些与他的生命相称，故被称为“属灵的食物”；属世之人以属世的事物为乐，这些与他的生命相称，故被称为“食物”，主要由知识构成。此处论述的是属灵之人，故“结种子的草本”和“结果子的树”象征的是属灵的食物，两者统称为“结有核的树”。下节描述的则是其属世的食物。</p>

<p><strong>[NCE]56.</strong> <a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_56/bible_king-james-version_genesis_1_29" target=_top>Genesis 1:29</a>. And God said, "Here, now, I am giving you every seed-bearing plant on the face of all the earth and every tree that has fruit; the tree that produces seed will serve you for food."<br />A person whose nature is heavenly enjoys only heavenly things, which are called heavenly food because they harmonize with the life such a person lives. A person whose nature is spiritual enjoys spiritual things, which are called spiritual food because they harmonize with the life this person lives. A person focused on the physical world similarly enjoys earthly things, which are called food because they are vital to such a person; these are mainly facts.<br />As spiritual people are the subject at present, their spiritual food is depicted by the representative items here. The seed-bearing plant represents a spiritual type of this food, as does the tree that has fruit; the more general term for both is the tree that produces seed. These people's earthly food is described in the next verse. </p>

Verse 29. And God said, Behold, I give you every herb bearing seed which is upon the faces of all the earth; and every tree in which is fruit; the tree yielding seed, to you it shall be for food. The 
celestial man is delighted with celestial things alone, which being in agreement with his life are called celestial food. The spiritual man is delighted with spiritual things, and as these are in agreement 
with his life they are called spiritual food. The natural man in like manner is delighted with natural things, which, being of his life, are called food, and consist chiefly of memory-knowledges. 
As the spiritual man is here treated of, his spiritual food is described by representatives, as by the "herb bearing seed" and by the "tree in which is fruit" which are called, in general, the "tree 
yielding seed." His natural food is described in the following verse. </p>

Verse 29 And God said, Behold, I give you every plant yielding seed which is upon the face<A name="fntext1"></a><A href="#fn1"><sup>a</sup></a> of the whole earth, and every tree in which there is fruit, the tree producing seed will be for you for food. 
A celestial man takes delight in none but celestial things, and because these suit his life they are called celestial food. A spiritual man takes delight in spiritual things, and because they suit 
his life they are called spiritual food. The same applies to a natural man and natural things, and because they suit his life they too are called food, and are chiefly facts. Here, since the subject is 
the spiritual man, his spiritual food is described by representatives, that is to say, spiritual food is represented by 'the plant yielding seed' and by 'the tree in which there is fruit', which in 
general are called 'the tree producing seed'. His natural food is described in the next verse.

Vers. 29.  Et dixit Deus, Ecce, do vobis omnem herbam seminificantem semen, quae super faciebus totius terrae, et omnem arborem, in qua fructus; arbor producens semen vobis erit in cibum. Caelestis 
homo unice delectatur caelestibus, quae quia conveniunt vitae ejus, vocantur cibi caelestes: spiritualis homo delectatur spiritualibus, quae quia vitae ejus conveniunt, vocantur cibi spirituales: naturalis 
similiter naturalibus, quae quia vitae ejus sunt, vocantur cibi, et sunt cumprimis scientifica. Hic quia de spirituali homine agitur, ejus cibi spirituales per repraesentativa describuntur; spirituales 
per 'herbam seminificantem semen,' et per 'arborem in qua fructus,' qui in genere vocantur 'arbor producens semen'; naturales ejus cibi in versu sequente describuntur. </p>
