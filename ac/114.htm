<h3 align="center" class="ired">属天的奥秘 第114节</h3>
<h4 align="center"></h4><p><strong>114.</strong>在圣经中，“宝石”，如决断的胸牌和亚伦以弗得两条肩带上的宝石，象征信之真理。制作胸牌的“金线和蓝色、紫色、朱红色线并捻的细麻”，象征与爱相关之物，所镶的“宝石”象征与爱所生之信相关之物，类似的，还有以弗得两条肩带上，镶在金槽里的红玛瑙刻成的两块“纪念石”（出埃及记<a href="http://39-27.cn/出28.9.htm">28:9</a>-<a href="http://39-27.cn/出28.22.htm">22</a>）。<br />以西结书在描述一个拥有属天的财富，亦即智慧聪明的人时，也说明了宝石的象征义：“你智慧充足，全然美丽……你曾在伊甸神的园中，佩戴各样宝石，就是红宝石、红璧玺、金钢石、水苍玉、红玛瑙、碧玉、蓝宝石、绿宝石、红玉和黄金，又有精美的鼓笛在你那里，都是在你受造之日预备齐全的。你从受造之日所行的都完全。”（以西结书<a href="http://39-27.cn/结28.12.htm">28:12</a>-<a href="http://39-27.cn/结28.13.htm">13</a>，<a href="http://39-27.cn/结28.15.htm">15</a>）显然，这些宝石并非指宝石，而是指信的属天属灵之性，每样宝石皆象征信的某个要素。</p>

<p><strong>[NCE]114.</strong> Precious stones in the Word, such as those on the breastplate of judgment and the shoulders of Aaron's ephod, symbolized and represented religious truth. The gold, the fibers of blue-violet, red-violet, and double-dyed scarlet, and the fine linen of the breastplate represented different aspects of love; the precious stones represented aspects of a faith based on love. So did the two memorial stones on the shoulders of the ephod, which were shoham stones in gold settings. (See <a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_114/bible_king-james-version_exodus_28_9-22" target=_top>Exodus 28:9-22</a>.) The Book of Ezekiel openly draws the same connection where it talks about a person who owns heavenly riches — wisdom and understanding:<br />You were full of wisdom and perfect in beauty in Eden, the garden of God.{*1} Every precious stone was your covering: ruby, topaz, diamond; tarshish,{*2} shoham, and jasper; sapphire, chrysoprase, emerald; and gold is what the tambourines and pipes in you were crafted from. On the day when you were created, they were prepared; you were perfect in your ways from the day when you were created. (<a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_114/bible_king-james-version_ezekiel_28_12-13" target=_top>Ezekiel 28:12-13</a>, <a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_114/bible_king-james-version_ezekiel_28_15" target=_top>15</a>)<br />The stones here do not mean stones but the heavenly and spiritual qualities of faith, as anyone can see. In fact every stone represented some essential ingredient of faith.<br /><br /><strong>Footnotes:</strong><br />{*1} These verses are addressed to the king of Tyre as the object of Ezekiel's prophecy. Tyre was a Phoenician trading city on the coast of the Mediterranean Sea in what is now southern Lebanon; the king was in Eden only in the metaphorical sense of being in paradise. [LHC, SS]<br />{*2} Swedenborg here transliterates the Hebrew word "tarshish" (תַּרְשִׁישׁ [taršîš]). Brown, Driver, and Briggs 1996 define it as "a precious stone, perhaps yellow jasper, or other gold-coloured stone." [LHC] </p>

The truth of faith is signified and represented in the Word by precious "stones" as by those in the breast-plate of judgment, and on the shoulders of Aaron's ephod. In the breast-plate, "gold, blue, 
bright crimson, scarlet double-dyed, and fine-twined linen" represented such things as are of love, and the precious "stones" such as are of faith from love; as did likewise the two "stones of memorial" 
on the shoulders of the ephod, which were onyx stones, set in ouches of gold (Exod. 28:9-22). This signification of precious stones is also plain from Ezekiel, where, speaking of a man possessed of 
heavenly riches, which are wisdom and intelligence, it is said: </p>
<p>     Full of wisdom, and perfect in beauty, thou hast been in Eden the garden of God; every precious stone was thy covering, the ruby, 
the topaz, the diamond, the beryl, the onyx, and the jasper; the sapphire, the chrysoprase, the emerald, and gold; the workmanship of thy tabrets and of thy pipes was in thee; in the day that thou wast 
created they were prepared; thou wast perfect in thy ways from the day that thou wast created (Ezek. 28:12, 13, 15),  which words it must be evident to everyone do not signify stones, but the celestial 
and spiritual things of faith; yea, each stone represented some essential of faith. </p>

<p align="center"><b>Elliott(1983-1999) 114</b></p><p><b>114.</b>
The truth of faith was also meant and represented in the Word precious stones, for example, those in the breast plate of judgement, and upon the shoulder-pieces of Aaron's ephod. in the breastplate, 
the gold, blue, purple, double-dyed scarlet, and fine-twined linen represented matters of love, while the precious stones represented matters of faith deriving from love, as did the two stones of remembrance 
on the shoulder-pieces of the ephod which were made from shoham encompassed with settings of gold, <a href="http://bible.gospelcom.net/cgi-bin/bible?passage=Exod%2028:9-22&amp;version=ESV&amp;interface=print&amp;showfn=yes&amp;showxref">Exod 28:9-22</a>. The same point, that the truth of faith is meant and represented by precious stones, 
is plainly stated in Ezekiel when the subject is the person who possesses the heavenly riches of wisdom and intelligence,  </p>
<blockquote>
Full of wisdom and perfect in beauty, you were in Eden, the garden 
of God. Every precious stone was your covering ruby, topaz, diamond, tarshish, shoham, and jasper, sapphire, chrysoprase, and emerald. And gold, the work of your drums and of your pipes, was within you. 
On the day that you were created they were prepared. You were perfect in your ways from the day you were created. <a href="http://bible.gospelcom.net/cgi-bin/bible?passage=Ezek%2028:12,%2013,%2015&amp;version=ESV&amp;interface=print&amp;showfn=yes&amp;showxref">Ezek 28:12, 13, 15</a>.  
</blockquote>
<p>Anyone may see that celestial and spiritual things of faith, 
and not just stones, are meant. Indeed each stone represented a particular essential element of faith.  </p>

Verum fidei etiam in Verbo significatum est et repraesentatam per lapides pretiosos, ut in pectorali judicii, et super humeris ephodi Aharonis; in pectorali, aurum, hyacinthinum, purpura, coccineum 
dibaphum, et xylinum, repraesentabant illa quae sunt amoris; lapides pretiosi, illa quae fidei ex amore; similiter lapides duo recordationis super humeris ephodi, qui erant ex shoham, circumdati fundis 
auri, Exod. xxviii 9-22; quod manifeste dicitur apud Ezechielem ubi agitur de homine possidente divitias caelestes, sapientiam et intelligentiam, 	Plenus sapientia, et perfectus pulchritudine, in Eden 
horto Dei fuisti; omnis lapis pretiosus, operimentum tuum, rubinus, topazius, adamas; tarshish, shoham, et iaspis; saphir, {x}chrysoprasus, smaragdus; et aurum, opus tympanorum tuorum, et fistularum 
tuarum, in te, in die, quo creatus es, praeparata sunt;...perfectus tu in viis tuis, a die quo creatus es, xxviii 12, 13, 15; </p>
<p>quae quod significent caelestia et spiritualia fidei, non autem lapides, 
unicuique constare potest: immo unusquisque lapis quoddam essentiale fidei repraesentabat.
