<h3 align="center" class="ired">属天的奥秘 第3267节</h3>
<h4 align="center"></h4><p><strong>3267.</strong>“按名单、照世系（births）”表内在品质取决于信的衍生物。这从“名”（name）或“名单”（names）的含义清楚可知，“名”（name）是指本质，“名单”（names）是指本质特征（<a href="3266.htm">3266</a>节），在此是指内在品质，因为经上说“这些是以实玛利儿子们的名单，按名单”。“名单”首先表一般品质，其次在此表居于这些一般品质中的具体品质，也就是关乎这些一般品质的内在之物。“名单”这个词也表示内在品质，因为这些品质取决于“按世系” 所表示的信的衍生物。“世系”（births）表信、因而教会的衍生物（<a href="1145.htm">1145</a>，<a href="1255.htm">1255</a>，<a href="1330.htm">1330</a>，<a href="3263.htm">3263</a>节）。<br />关于主的属灵教会，情况是这样：它分散遍及全世界，就信条或信之真理而言在各个地方都不相同。这些差别就是“世系”所表示的衍生物，而这些衍生物要么同时、要么相继出现。这同样适用于主在天上的国度。也就是说，在信的事物上同样存在差别，并且这差别如此之大，以致在构成信之真理的事物方面，没有哪两个社群，甚至没有哪两个社群中人是完全一致的（<a href="3241.htm">3241</a>节）。但尽管如此，主在天上的属灵国度是一体。其原因在于，对所有人来说，仁是首要事物，因为构成属灵教会的是仁，而不是信，除非你说信就是仁。<br />凡拥有仁爱者都爱自己的邻舍，当这邻舍在信仰问题上与他不同时，只要他的邻舍活在良善与真理中，他不会计较。他也不会谴责善良的外邦人，尽管他们不知道主，也不知道任何信之真理。因为拥有仁爱，也就是过着良善生活的人从主接受诸如与其良善一致的那类真理，而外邦人则接受诸如能在来世被折向信之真理的那类事物（<a href="2599.htm">2599</a>-<a href="2603.htm">2603</a>节）。但是，没有仁爱，也就是没有过着良善生活的人永远不可能接受任何真理。他的确知道真理，但这真理并未植根于他的生活。他也的确能口头上谈论真理，但他心里没有它，因为真理无法与邪恶联结。因此，那些知道被视为信条的真理，却没有过着仁爱或良善生活的人，尽管因生在教会而身在教会，然而却不属于教会。因为他们里面没有教会的任何东西，也就是说，根本没有真理能与之联结的任何良善。 </p>

In their names, according to their births. That this signifies interior qualities according to the derivations of faith, is evident from the signification of "name," as being quality, or from the signification 
of "names," as being qualities (n. 3266), in this case interior qualities, because it is said, "these are the names of the sons of Ishmael, in their names," where "names" in the first place 
denote general qualities, and in the second place the qualities which are within the former, or which are interior in respect to those general qualities; and also because these qualities are according 
to the derivations of faith which are signified by "according to their births." (That "births" signify the derivations of faith, thus of the church, may be seen above, n. 1145, 1255, 1330, 3263.) [2] 
With the Lord's spiritual church the case is this: It is scattered throughout the whole world, and everywhere varies as to articles of belief, or the truths of faith; and these varieties are the derivations 
which are signified by the "births," and which come forth both at one and the same time and also one after another. It is the very same with the Lord's spiritual kingdom in the heavens, in which 
there is variety as to the things of faith, and this to such a degree that there is not one society, nor even one person in a society, that in the things of the truth of faith has an idea altogether 
in agreement with the ideas of others (n. 3241) but nevertheless the Lord's spiritual kingdom in the heavens is a one; the reason of which is that with all there charity is the principal thing; for 
charity makes the spiritual church, and not faith, unless you call charity faith. [3] He who is in charity loves his neighbor, and when the neighbor differs from him in matters of belief, he excuses 
it provided that his neighbor lives in good and truth. He also does not condemn the well-disposed Gentiles, although they are ignorant of the Lord, and do not know anything of the faith. For he who 
is in charity, that is, who lives in good, receives from the Lord truths of such a quality as agree with his good, and Gentiles receive such truths as in the other life may be bent into truths of faith 
(n. 2599-2603). But he who is not in charity, that is, who does not live in good, can never receive any truth; he may indeed know truth, but it is not implanted in his life; thus he may indeed have 
it in his mouth, but not in his heart. For truth cannot be conjoined with evil, and therefore those who know the truths which are called the articles of belief, and do not live in charity or in good, 
although they are in the church because born in it, are yet not of the church, for there is nothing of the church in them, that is nothing of good with which truth may be conjoined. </p>

'By their names, according to their births' means interior characteristics according to derivatives of faith. This is clear from the meaning of 'name' as the essential nature, or of 'names' as the essential 
characteristics, dealt with immediately above in <a href="3266.htm">3266</a>, here interior characteristics since the words used are 'these are the names of the sons of Ishmael, by their names'. In the first case 'the 
names' means the general characteristics, but here in the second case specific characteristics residing within those general ones are meant, that is, those which in relation to the general are interior. 
The word 'names' also means interior characteristics because these characteristics go according to derivatives of faith, meant by 'according to their births' - 'births' meaning derivatives of faith, 
and so of the Church, see <a href="1145.htm">1145</a>, <a href="1255.htm">1255</a>, <a href="1330.htm">1330</a>, <a href="3263.htm">3263</a>. </p>
<p></p>
<p><b>[2]</b>
 The situation with the Lord's spiritual Church is that it is spread throughout the whole world, and wherever it exists varies so far as matters 
of belief or truths of faith are concerned. Those variations are the derivatives meant by 'births', which occur either simultaneously or consecutively. The same applies to the Lord's spiritual kingdom 
in the heavens - that is to say, in matters of faith variety is so great that not one community, nor even one member of a community, is in complete agreement with any other in the things which 
constitute the truths of faith, <a href="3241.htm">3241</a>. But for all that, the Lord's spiritual kingdom in the heavens is one, the reason being that with everyone charity is the chief thing, for charity makes the spiritual 
Church, not faith, unless you say that faith is charity. </p>
<p></p>
<p><b>[3]</b>
 Anyone who has charity loves the neighbour, and when the latter differs from him in matters of belief he thinks nothing of it provided 
he leads a life that is good and true. Neither also does he condemn upright gentiles, in spite of the fact that they have no knowledge of the Lord and do not know any truth of faith. For the person 
who has charity, that is, who leads a good life, receives such truths from the Lord as agree with his good, and gentiles receive such things as can be turned in the next life into the truths of faith, <a href="2599.htm">2599</a>-<a href="2603.htm">2603</a>. But the person who has no charity, that is, who does not lead a good life, cannot receive any truth. He can indeed know the truth, but it is not implanted in his life. He is indeed able to 
speak that truth with his lips, but not have it in his heart, for truth cannot be joined to evil. For this reason also, although they are in the Church because they were born in it, those who know truths 
which they call matters of belief and yet do not lead a charitable or good life nevertheless do not belong to the Church. For they have nothing of the Church within them, that is, no good at all 
to which truth may be joined. </p>

`In nominibus eorum, secundum nativitates eorum': quod significet interiores qualitates secundum derivationes fidei, constat ex significatione `nominis' quod sit quale seu `nominum' quod sint qualitates, 
de qua nunc supra n. 3266, hic qualitates interiores quia dicitur `haec nomina filiorum Jishmaelis in nominibus eorum,' ubi nomina priore loco sunt qualitates communes, hic qualitates quae in illis, 
seu quae quoad illa, hoc est, interiores; et quia hae qualitates sunt secundum derivationes fidei, quae significantur per `secundum nativitates eorum'; quod `nativitates' sint derivationes fidei, 
ita Ecclesiae, videatur n. 1145, 1255, 1330, 3263. [2] Cum Ecclesia spirituali Domini ita se habet, quod sparsa sit per totum terrarum orbem, et quod ubivis quoad credenda seu vera fidei sit varia; varietates 
{1}illae sunt derivationes quae significantur per `nativitates,' quae tam simul eodem tempore quam successive existunt; ipsum regnum spirituale Domini in caelis etiam est tale, nempe quoad illa 
quae sunt fidei, varium, usque adeo ut non sit una societas, ne quidem unus in societate, qui in illis quae sunt veri fidei, prorsus concordem cum aliis ideam habeat, n. 3241; sed usque regnum spirituale 
Domini in caelis est unum; causa est quia charitas omnibus est principale, charitas enim facit Ecclesiam spiritualem, non {2}fides, nisi fidem dicas charitatem; [3] qui in charitate est, is proximum 
amat, et quod dissentiat a se in credendis, hoc excusat, modo in bono et vero vivat; etiam gentes probas, tametsi ignorant Dominum et non aliquid fidei norunt, non damnat; qui enim in charitate, 
hoc est, in bono vivit, is a Domino {3}recipit vera qualia ejus bono conveniunt, et gentes talia quae {4}in altera vita flecti possunt in vera fidei, n. 2599-2603; at qui non in charitate est, hoc est, 
non in bono vivit, is nusquam potest aliquod verum recipere; scire quidem verum potest, sed non ejus vitae implantatur, ita id in ore quidem potest ferre, sed non in corde; verum enim non conjungi 
potest malo, quare etiam illi qui sciunt vera quae vocantur credenda, et non in charitate seu in bono vivunt, tametsi in Ecclesia sunt quia ibi nati, usque tamen non ab Ecclesia sunt, nam nihil Ecclesiae 
est in illis, hoc est, nihil boni cui conjungatur verum. @1 illi I$  @2 fidem I$  @3 accipit$  @4 after possunt$  </p>
