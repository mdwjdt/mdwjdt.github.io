<h3 align="center" class="ired">属天的奥秘 第8595节</h3>
<h4 align="center"></h4><p><strong>8595.</strong>“摩西对约书亚说”表神性流注进入进行争战的真理。这从“说”的含义和“约书亚”的代表清楚可知。“说”在此是指流注，因为它进入进行争战的真理，进行争战的真理由约书亚来代表；这流注之所以是神性，是因为“摩西”代表神性真理，也就是直接从主发出的真理，这真理因是纯粹的神性，故流入任何种类的信之真理，并使它们成为真理。“约书亚”是指进行争战的真理。“约书亚”明显代表进行争战的真理，因为他被吩咐去与亚玛力争战，也就是与内层邪恶所生的虚假争战。这种争战必须由通过神性真理的流注而变得好战的真理来进行。直接从主发出的神之真理本身不会进行争战，而是和平的；事实上，它是和平本身，因为它是从主的神性之爱的神性良善发出的。但为了变得好战，它流入诸如对真理和良善有一种炽热的热情，并被这种热情激发去争战的那类天使。这就是“约书亚”所代表的进行争战的真理之起源。<br />“约书亚”因代表这种真理，所以在摩西之后也成为以色列人的领袖，带领他们进入迦南地，并与那里的列族争战。这也解释了为何当他进入迦南地时，耶和华的一个使者手里拿着拔出来的剑向他显现，他自称是“耶和华军队的元帅”（约书亚记<a href="http://39-27.cn/书5.13.htm">5:13</a>-<a href="http://39-27.cn/书5.15.htm">15</a>）。“手里拔出来的剑”表示以其能力进行争战的神之真理。“剑”表示进行争战的真理（参看<a href="2799.htm">2799</a>，<a href="4499.htm">4499</a>节）；“拔出来的剑”表示不断与虚假并邪恶争战的真理（参看<a href="8294.htm">8294</a>节）；“手”表示能力（<a href="878.htm">878</a>，<a href="4931.htm">4931</a>-<a href="4937.htm">4937</a>，<a href="7518.htm">7518</a>，<a href="8050.htm">8050</a>，<a href="8153.htm">8153</a>节）；“迦南地的列族”表示必须与之争战的虚假和邪恶（<a href="8054.htm">8054</a>节）。</p>

And Moses said unto Joshua. That this signifies Divine influx into fighting truth, is evident from the signification of "saying," as here being influx, because into truth combating, which is represented 
by Joshua; that it is Divine influx, is because by Moses is represented Divine truth, that is, the truth which proceeds immediately from the Lord, which truth, being purely Divine, flows into the 
truths of faith of whatever kind, and causes them to be truths; and from the representation of Joshua, as being fighting truth. That Joshua denotes fighting truth is evident from the fact that he was 
commanded to fight against Amalek, that is, against the falsities from interior evil. This war must be waged by truth made fighting through the influx of Divine truth. The truth Divine itself which proceeds 
immediately from the Lord, is not fighting, but pacific; for it is peace itself, because it proceeds from the Divine good of the Lord's Divine love. But in order that it may become fighting truth, 
it flows into such angels as are in ardent zeal for truth and good, and who being excited by this zeal fight. Hence comes the fighting truth which is represented by Joshua. [2] As this truth was 
represented by Joshua, therefore he was also made the leader over the sons of Israel after Moses, and brought them into the land of Canaan, and fought with the nations there. For this reason also, when 
he came into the land of Canaan, there appeared to him an angel of Jehovah with a sword drawn in his hand, who called himself "the Prince of Jehovah's army" (Josh. 5:13-15). By "a sword drawn in the 
hand" is signified fighting truth Divine in its power. (That "a sword" denotes truth fighting, see n. 2799, 4499; also that "a drawn sword" denotes truth continually fighting against falsities and evils, 
see n. 8294; and that "hand" denotes power, n. 878, 4931-4937, 7518, 8050, 8153; and also that by "the nations in the land of Canaan" are signified falsities and evils against which the fight is 
to be waged, n. 8504.) </p>

'And Moses said to Joshua' means a Divine influx into truth that engages in conflict. This is clear from the meaning here of 'saying' as influx, since it passes into truth that engages in conflict, represented 
by Joshua', the reason why this influx is Divine being that 'Moses' represents Divine Truth, that is, truth which goes forth directly from the Lord (this truth, since it is wholly Divine, is 
what flows into any truth of faith whatever and causes it to be a truth); and from the representation of 'Joshua' as truth that engages in conflict. 'Joshua' clearly represents truth that engages in 
conflict because he was commanded to fight against Amalek, that is, against falsities arising from interior evil. This is what the truth made militant through an influx of Divine Truth has to fight against. 
God's truth itself which goes forth directly from the Lord does not engage in conflict but is peaceable, being peace itself, since it goes forth from the Divine Goodness of the Lord's Divine Love. 
But to become militant it flows in among such angels as have a burning zeal for what is true and good, and when roused by that zeal they go into battle. This is the origin of the truth engaging in 
conflict that is represented by 'Joshua'.  </p>
<p></p>
<p><b>[2]</b>
 Because such truth was represented by 'Joshua' he also became the leader of the children of Israel after Moses, led them into the land of Canaan, and 
fought the nations there. This also explains why, when he came into the land of Canaan, there appeared to him the Angel of Jehovah with his sword drawn in his hand, who called himself Commander of Jehovah's 
army, <a href="http://bible.gospelcom.net/cgi-bin/bible?passage=Josh%205:13-15&amp;version=ESV&amp;interface=print&amp;showfn=yes&amp;showxref">Josh 5:13-15</a>. 'His sword drawn in his hand' means God's truth that engages in conflict, in its power. </p>
<p>'The sword' means truth engaging in conflict, see <a href="2799.htm">2799</a>, <a href="4499.htm">4499</a>; as unceasing conflict 
against falsities and evils, <a href="8294.htm">8294</a>. </p>
<p>'Hand' means power, <a href="878.htm">878</a>, <a href="4931.htm">4931</a>-<a href="4937.htm">4937</a>, <a href="7518.htm">7518</a>, <a href="8050.htm">8050</a>, <a href="8153.htm">8153</a>. </p>
<p>And by 'the nations' in the land of Canaan are meant the falsities and evils that must be fought against, <a href="8054.htm">8054</a>. </p>

`Et dixit Moscheh ad Joschuam': quod significet influxum Divinum in verum pugnans, constat ex significatione `dicere' quod hic sit influxus, quia in verum pugnans, quod repraesentatur per `Joschuam'; 
quod sit influxus Divinus, est quia per `Moschen' repraesentatur Divinum Verum, hoc est, verum quod immediate a Domino procedit; hoc verum, quia est pure Divinum, influit in vera (t)fidei quaecumque, 
et facit ut vera sint; et ex repraesentatione `Joschuae' quod sit verum pugnans; quod `Joschuah' sit verum pugnans, constat ex eo quod ei mandatum sit ut pugnaret contra Amalekum, hoc est, contra falsa 
ex interiore malo; contra {1}illud pugnabit verum quod pugnans factum est per influxum {2}Divini Veri; ipsum verum Divinum, quod a Domino immediate procedit, non est pugnans, sed est pacificum: nam 
{3}est ipsa pax, procedit enim a Divino Bono Divini Amoris Domini; sed hoc ut fiat pugnans, influit apud tales angelos qui in ardente zelo pro vero et bono sunt, et ex zelo illo excitati pugnant; inde 
verum pugnans quod repraesentatur per `Joschuam.' 	2 Quia hoc verum per Joschuam' repraesentabatur, ideo etiam ille factus est dux super filios Israelis post Moschen, et introducebat illos in terram 
Canaanem, pugnabatque cum gentibus ibi; ideo quoque, cum in terram Canaanem venit, apparuit {4}illi angelus Jehovae cum gladio evaginato in manu, et se {5}vocabat `principem exercitus Jehovae,' Jos. 
v 13-15; per `gladium evaginatum in manu' significatur verum Divinum pugnans in sua potentia; quod `gladius' sit verum pugnans, videatur n. 2799, 4499, quodque `gladius evaginatus' sit pugnans continue 
contra falsa et mala, n. 8294; et quod `manus' sit potentia, n. 878, 4931-4937, 7518, 8050, 8153; {6}tum quod per `gentes in terra Canaane' significentur falsa et mala, contra quae pugnandum, n. 8054
