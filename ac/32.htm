<h3 align="center" class="ired">属天的奥秘 第32节</h3>
<h4 align="center"></h4><p><strong>32.</strong>爱与信先被称为“两个大光”，之后爱被称为“大光”，信被称为“小光”，爱“管昼”，信“管夜”，这些都是隐藏的奥秘，特别是在此时代的末了，故因主的慈悲，我被允许阐明其中的含义。<br />在这末后的日子，这些奥秘尤其不为人知，因为此时正是时代的末了，爱几乎荡然无存，信也因此几近失落，正如主曾预告说：“那些日子的灾难一过去，日头就变黑了，月亮也不放光，众星要从天上坠落，天势都要震动。”（马太福音<a href="http://39-27.cn/太24.29.htm">24:29</a>）在此，“日头”象征爱，已经变黑；“月亮”象征信，不再放光；“众星”象征信仰认知，已从天上坠落，它们是天上的势能。<br />上古教会不承认什么信，除了爱。属天的天使也不知何为信，除非它属于爱。整个天堂是爱的天堂，因为天堂除了爱的生活，没有其它。爱是天堂之乐的源泉，其乐之大，不可言说，也不可思议。专注于爱的人，从心里爱主，同时了解、承认、觉察一切爱都是出于主，故一切生命，唯独属于爱的生命，以及快乐，都是出于主，无一丝是出于自己。<br />对于主是一切爱的源头，他显圣时所现的日头即象征了这一点，如经上记着说：“他的脸面明亮如日头，衣裳洁白如光。”（马太福音<a href="http://39-27.cn/太17.2.htm">17:2</a>）“脸”象征心灵，“衣裳”象征心灵所发。故“日头”，亦即爱，表主的神性，“光”，亦即爱所生之智，表主的人性。</p>

<p><strong>[NCE]32.</strong> Love and faith are first called the great lights, then love is called the greater light and faith the smaller light. It says that love will rule during the day and that faith will rule during the night. Because this information is unknown and less accessible than ever at this time — the end of an era — the Lord in his divine mercy has allowed me to lay open the true situation.<br />It is especially well hidden in these final days because the close of the age has arrived and almost no love exists, consequently almost no faith.{*1} The Lord himself predicted this event in words recorded in the Gospels:<br />The sun will go dark, and the moon will not shed light, and the stars will fall down from the sky, and the powers of the heavens will be shaken. (<a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_32/bible_king-james-version_matthew_24_29" target=_top>Matthew 24:29</a>)<br />The sun here means love, which has gone dark. The moon means faith, which is not shedding light. The stars mean religious concepts (the powers and forces of the heavens), which are falling down from heaven.<br />[2] The earliest church acknowledged no faith besides love itself. Heavenly angels{*2} too have no idea what faith is if it is not a matter of love. The entirety of heaven gives itself over to love, because no other kind of life than that of love exists in the heavens. Love is the source of all their happiness, which is so immense that not a bit of it can be put into words or grasped in any way by the human mind.<br />People who dwell in love do love the Lord with all their heart, but they know, say, and perceive that all love comes from the Lord and from nowhere else, as does all life (which is the product of love alone) and so all happiness. Not the smallest measure of love, life, or happiness do they claim to possess on their own.<br />In the Lord's transfiguration, the great light — the sun — represented the fact that he is the source of all love, since<br />His face shone like the sun, while his clothes became like the light. (<a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_32/bible_king-james-version_matthew_17_2" target=_top>Matthew 17:2</a>)<br />The face symbolizes the deepest levels of being, while clothes symbolize the things that issue from those levels. So the sun (love) means the Lord's divinity, and light (the wisdom that rises out of love), his humanity.<br /><br /><strong>Footnotes:</strong><br />{*1} "The close of the age" (consummatio saeculi, in the Latin) is a scriptural term referring to a time of final judgment on the world. The concept pervades Daniel, Revelation, and parts of Matthew; see <a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_32/bible_king-james-version_matthew_13_39-40" target=_top>Matthew 13:39-40</a> for a specific example of the term. In Swedenborg's system the Last Judgment does not refer to the end of the earth as we know it; rather to a purgation of the spiritual world that makes it possible for a "new church" to be established on earth. It also marks the commencement of an era when spiritual truths that were formerly hidden are to become accessible to human minds. Swedenborg regarded his own works as a crucial component of this new revelation. In his 1758 book Last Judgment, he states that this event took place in the spiritual world in 1757, the year after the last volume of Secrets of Heaven was published. For more on the Last Judgment, see note 4 in <a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_32/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_931" target=_top>931</a>.

Love and faith are first called "great luminaries" and afterwards love is called a "greater luminary" and faith a "lesser luminary;" and it is said of love that it shall "rule by day" and of faith that 
it shall "rule by night." As these are arcana which are hidden, especially in this end of days, it is permitted of the Lord's Divine mercy to explain them. The reason why these arcana are more especially 
concealed in this end of days is that now is the consummation of the age, when there is scarcely any love, and consequently scarcely any faith, as the Lord Himself foretold in the Evangelists in 
these words: </p>
<p>     The sun shall be darkened, and the moon shall not give her light, and the stars shall fall from heaven, and the powers of the heavens shall be shaken (Matt. 24:29). By the "sun" 
is here meant love, which is darkened; by the "moon" faith, which does not give light; and by the "stars" the knowledges of faith, which fall from heaven, and which are the "virtues and powers of the 
heavens."  [2] The Most Ancient Church acknowledged no other faith than love itself. The celestial angels also do not know what faith is except that which is of love. The universal heaven is a heaven 
of love, for there is no other life in the heavens than the life of love. From this is derived all heavenly happiness, which is so great that nothing of it admits of description, nor can ever be conceived 
by any human idea. Those who are under the influence of love, love the Lord from the heart, but yet know, declare, and perceive, that all love, and consequently all life-which is of love alone-and 
thus all happiness, come solely from the Lord, and that they have not the least of love, of life, or of happiness, from themselves. That it is the Lord from whom all love comes, was also represented 
by the great luminary or "sun" at His transfiguration, for it is written: </p>
<p>     His face did shine as the sun, and his raiment was white as the light (Matt. 17:2). Inmost things are signified by the 
face, and the things that proceed from them, by the raiment. Thus the Lord's Divine was signified by the "sun" or love; and His Human by the "light" or wisdom proceeding from love. </p>

<p align="center"><b>Elliott(1983-1999) 32</b></p><p><b>32.</b>
Love and faith are first called 'the great lights', then love is called 'the greater light' and faith 'the lesser light'. In reference to love it is said that it will have dominion over the day, and 
in reference to faith that it will have dominion over the night. Because these are arcana and have become hidden, especially at this end of an epoch, in the Lord's Divine mercy let the whole subject be 
opened up. The reason they have become hidden, especially at this present end of an epoch, is that now is the close of the age, when love is almost non-existent, and consequently faith too, just as 
the Lord Himself foretold in the Gospels with these words,   The sun will be darkened, and the moon will not give its light, and the stars will fall from heaven, and the powers of the heavens will be 
shaken. <a href="http://bible.gospelcom.net/cgi-bin/bible?passage=Matt%2024:29&amp;version=ESV&amp;interface=print&amp;showfn=yes&amp;showxref">Matt 24:29</a>.  </p>
<p>Here 'the sun' is used to mean love, which is 'darkened', 'the moon' faith which does not give its light, 'the stars' cognitions of faith which fall from heaven, and which are 
the various 'powers of the heavens'. The Most Ancient Church acknowledged no other faith than love itself; celestial angels as well do not know what faith is except faith which stems from love. Love 
pervades the whole of heaven, for in the heavens no other life is found except the life that belongs to love. This is the source of all happiness in heaven, a happiness so great that no aspect of it 
can be described or in any way captured in human concepts. People in whom this love is present love the Lord wholeheartedly. Yet they realize, say, and perceive that all love, thus all life, which belongs 
exclusively to love, and so all happiness, come from the Lord and nowhere else, and that they derive not one trace of love, life, and happiness from themselves. The Lord's being the source of all 
love was again represented by the greater light, that is, the sun, at the Transfiguration, for His face shone like the sun, and His garments became white as the light, <a href="http://bible.gospelcom.net/cgi-bin/bible?passage=Matt%2017:2&amp;version=ESV&amp;interface=print&amp;showfn=yes&amp;showxref">Matt 17:2</a>. What is inmost is 
meant by His face, and what emanates from the inmost by His garments. Thus His Divinity is meant by the sun or love, and His Humanity by the light or wisdom coming from love.  </p>

</p><b>32.</b>
Amor et fides vocantur primum 'luminaria magna'; dein amor 'luminare magnum,' et fides 'luminare minus'; et de amore dicitur quod 'dominabitur in die,' et de fide quod 'dominabitur in nocte'; haec quia 
arcana sunt, et abdita imprimis in hoc fine dierum ex Divina Domini Misericordia, licet aperire quomodo se res habet quod abdita imprimis in hoc fine dierum, causa est quia nunc es consummatio {1} 
saeculi, et amor paene nullus, proinde nec fides; sicut Ipse Dominus praedixit apud Evangelistas his verbis, 	Sol obscurabitur, et luna non dabit lucem, et stellae cadent de caelo, et virtutes caelorum 
commovebuntur, Matth. xxiv 29; </p>
<p>per 'solem' hic intelligitur amor, qui 'obscuratus'; per 'lunam' fides 'quae non dat lucem'; per 'stellas' cognitiones fidei quae cadunt de caelo, quae sunt 'virtutes 
et potestates caelorum.' Antiquissima Ecclesia non aliam fidem agnovit quam ipsum amorem; caelestes quoque angeli non sciunt quid fides, nisi quae amoris; universum caelum est amoris, nam in caelis 
non datur alia vita quam vita amoris; inde omnis felicitas, quae tanta ut aliquid ejus non describi possit nec usquam aliqua idea humana capi. Qui in amore sunt, Dominum ex corde amant, se norunt, dicunt, 
et percipiunt, quod omnis amor, ita omnis vita quae solius amoris est, et sic omnis felicitas, unice ex Domino veniat, et quod ne hilum amoris, vitae et felicitatis ex semetipsis habeant. Quo Dominus 
sit, ex Quo omnis amor, repraesentatum etiam est per 'luminare magnum' seu solem cum transformatus, nam 	Splenduit facies Ipsius sicut Sol, vestimenta autem facta sunt sicut Lux, Matth. xvii 2; </p>
<p>significantur 
intima per 'faciem,' et quae ab intimis procedunt per 'vestes,' ita Divinum Ipsius per 'solem' seu amorem, et Humanum Ipsius per 'lucem' seu sapientiam ex amore. @	1 I has consumatio.
