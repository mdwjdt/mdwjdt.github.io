<h3 align="center" class="ired">属天的奥秘 第1835节</h3>
<h4 align="center"></h4><p><strong>1835.</strong>“亚伯兰就把它们赶走了”表主将它们赶走了。这从前面所述清楚可知。这也是教会的情形：教会在远离仁爱之初，邪恶和衍生的虚假很容易被赶走，因为教会距离仁爱尚未那么遥远，所以人们的心思很容易被折过来。然而，随着时间推移，邪恶和衍生的虚假逐渐增长，从而得到巩固和强化。这个问题将在后面予以论述。<br />主尽可能不断驱散恶与假，但祂是经由良知驱散的。当良知松懈时，主所能流入的渠道就不存在了，因为与人同在的主的流注通过仁爱进入良知。不过，一个新的渠道形成，并取代了这仁爱，该渠道是外在的，也就是说，流注现经由对法律的畏惧，以及对丧失生命、荣誉财富和名声的畏惧而来。不过，这些约束并非良知的约束，仅仅是外在约束，以使人能与他人在社会上共同生活，并显得友好，无论他的内在如何。<br />这种渠道，或这些约束在来世没有一点用处，因为在来世，外在事物会被除去，每个人都保持他内在的样子。有很多人在世时曾过着道德文明的生活，没有伤害任何人，有友好和礼貌的好行为，甚至向很多人行过善事。然而，他们做这一切唯独为了自己，为了名利等等。在来世，这些人就在地狱人之列，因为他们里面没有任何善与真之物，只有恶与假，甚至仇恨、报复、残忍、邪淫，只不过这些没有表现在人前，也就是说，是因为刚才所提及的畏惧，即外在约束占了上风。</p>

<p><strong>[NCE]1835.</strong> And Abram drove them away means that the Lord put them to flight, as can be seen from the remarks above.<br />It is the same with the church, too. When it begins to fall away from love for others, evil and the falsity that comes from it can be chased off fairly easily. Up to that point, conditions in the church are not very far removed from neighborly love, so the mindset of the people in it is quite flexible. Over time, though, evil and its falsity grow, and as they grow they strengthen and stiffen, as will be told below.{*1} [2] The Lord constantly drives as much evil and falsity away as he can, but he does so through conscience. When the bonds of our conscience loosen, the Lord has no means of influencing us, because he acts on us by flowing through charity into our conscience. A new means does develop to take its place, but it is an external one: fear of the law and fear for our life, status, money, and consequent prestige. These are not matters of conscience but only superficial restraints. They make it possible for us to live in the same community with others and to seem friendly, no matter what we are like inside.<br />[3] These means, or restraints, have no effect at all in the other world. Outward appearances are stripped away there and inner character remains. There are large numbers of people who have lived an upright life in private and public, avoided hurting anyone, acted in a polite and friendly way, and even done good to many others, but only for selfish reasons — for the sake of position, money, and so on. They end up among the inhabitants of hell in the other life, because inside them they harbor no goodness or truth but only evil and falsity. In fact hatred, vengefulness, cruelty, and adultery lurk inside them, remaining hidden from others; and they remain hidden to the extent that those fears or external restraints are in charge.<br /><br /><strong>Footnotes:</strong><br />{*1} Growth of evil and falsity is touched on throughout the rest of this chapter, but in particular in <a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_1835/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_1857" target=_top>1857-1861</a>yyy<a href="https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/multi/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_1835/swedenborg_secrets-of-heaven-nce_1" target=_top>1</a>.

And Abram drove them away. That this signifies that the Lord put them to flight, is evident from what has been said. And such also is the case with a church when it is beginning to recede from charity. 
Evils and the falsities thence derived are then more easily put to flight, for as yet the church is in a state that is not so far removed from charity, and thus men's minds are more easily bent. But 
in process of time evils and the falsities derived from them increase, and so are confirmed and strengthened; and this is treated of in what follows.  [2] So far as possible the Lord is continually 
putting evils and falsities to flight, but through conscience. When conscience is relaxed, there is no medium through which the Lord can flow in, for the Lord's influx with man is by means of charity 
into his conscience. But in place of this charity a new medium succeeds and is formed, which is external, namely, the fear of the law, fear for life, for honors and wealth, and the reputation from these. 
But these are not of conscience; they are only external bonds which enable a man to live in society with others, and to appear as a friend, whatsoever he may be inwardly.  [3] But this medium, or 
these bonds, are of no account in the other life, for there externals are removed, and everyone remains as he is internally. There are very many who have lived a moral and a civic life, have injured 
no one, have performed acts of friendship and civility, nay, have done good to many, but only for the sake of self, with a view to honors, gain, and the like. In the other life these are among the infernals, 
because they have nothing of good and truth within, but only evil and falsity, nay, hatred, revenge, cruelty, adulteries, which do not appear before man, that is to say insofar as the fears just 
referred to, which are external bonds, prevail. </p>

<p align="center"><b>Elliott(1983-1999) 1835</b></p><p><b>1835.</b>
That 'Abram drove them away' means that the Lord put them to flight is clear from what has been stated. The position is the same with regard to the Church. When it starts to depart from charity, evils 
and derivative falsities are quite easily put to flight, for it is still in a state not far removed from charity, and so people's minds are quite pliable. In the course of time however evils and derivative 
falsities increase, and so are confirmed and consolidated. This matter will be dealt with later on. </p>
<p></p>
<p><b>[2]</b>
 As far as it is possible the Lord is constantly putting evils and falsities to flight, 
but He does so by means of conscience. When the bonds of conscience are loosed no channel exists by which the Lord may flow in, for the Lord's influx with man is an influx by way of charity into his 
conscience. But when this comes about a new channel, an external one, is formed and takes the place of charity, that is to say, influx now comes through a fear of the law, fear of loss of life, honour, 
wealth, and consequent reputation. But these bonds are not those of conscience; they are merely external bonds which enable a person to live in society with others and to appear friendly, whatever 
he may be like within. </p>
<p></p>
<p><b>[3]</b>
 This channel, or these bonds, are of no value whatever in the next life, for in that life things that are external are taken away, and such as the person is within remains. 
There are very many who have led good lives, private and public, have harmed no one, and have performed acts of friendship and kindness; indeed they have done good to very many. Yet they acted solely 
for themselves, for the sake of honour, gain, and similar considerations. In the next life these are among those in hell since they have nothing good and true within them at all, only evil and falsity. 
Indeed they have nothing but hatred, revenge, cruelty, and adultery within them, which do not show themselves before anyone - not showing themselves, that is, insofar as those fears which constitute 
external restraints prevail. </p>

</p><b>1835.</b>
Quod 'abegit illa Abram' significet quod Dominus: profugaverit, constat ex illis quae dicta sunt: se habet quoque ita cum Ecclesia; quando haec recedere incipit a charitate, tunc mala et inde falsa 
facilius profugantur, nam usque adhuc in quodam statu est non ita remoto a charitate, ita flexibiliores eorum animi; successu temporis mala et inde falsa increscunt, sic confirmantur et corroborantur, 
quibus agitur in sequentibus. [2] Dominus continue quantum possibile est, mala et falsa profugat, sed hoc per conscientiam; quae e relaxatur, non datur medium per quod influat Dominus, nam influxus Domini 
apud hominem est per charitatem in ejus conscientiam; tunc novum medium succedit et formatur quod est externum; nempe per timorem legis, timorem jacturae {1} vitae, honoris, opum, et famae inde; 
sed haec non sunt conscientiae, sunt modo vincula externa quae faciunt ut homo in societate cum aliis vivere possit, et apparere sicut amicus, qualiscumque intus est; [3] sed hoc medium, aut haec vincula, 
nihil quicquam faciunt in altera vita, externa enim ibi removent et qualis est intus ibi manet; perplures sunt, qui moralem et civilem vitam vixerunt, neminem laeserant, amicitias et civilitates 
praestiterant immo bonum pluribus fecerant, sed solum sui causa, propter honores lucrum, et talia; in altera vita inter infernales sunt, quia intus: nihil boni et veri, sed malum et falsum, immo odium, 
vindicta crudelitas, adulteria, quae non apparent coram homine, et in tantum non apparent, in quantum timores illi qui sunt vincula externa, valent. 	@1 see note, n. 1077.$ </p>
