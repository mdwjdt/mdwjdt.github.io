<h4 align="center"></h4><p><strong>542.</strong>那些被带进天堂以认识其性质者，要么其身体的冲动和虚假的观念被归于沉寂，因为没人能带着尘世的身体冲动和虚假观念进入天堂，要么被那些以奇迹般的方式缓和这类不洁和引起纷争之物的灵的气场所环绕。对于一些灵来说，内在是打开的。根据他们的生活以及由此获得的秉性，他们通过多种方式被预备。</p>

<p><strong>[NCE]542.</strong> In those who are taken to heaven for the purpose of discovering what it is like, bodily desires and delusions are put to sleep, since no one can enter heaven bringing such things along from the world. Either that or they are surrounded with the aura of spirits who moderate the unclean and discordant things in them in a miraculous way. Some people may have their inner recesses opened. These are some of the methods [of preparation], and there are others, depending on the way people have lived and the character they have acquired along the way. </p>
<p align="center"><b>Potts(1905-1910) 542</b></p><p><b>542.</b>
They who are taken up into heaven in order that they may know its quality either have their bodily things and fanciful notions lulled to quiescence-for no one can enter heaven with the bodily things 
and fanciful notions that they take with them from this world-or else they are surrounded by a sphere of spirits who miraculously temper such things as are impure and that cause disagreement. With some 
the interiors are opened. In these and other ways they are prepared, according to their lives and the nature thereby acquired. </p>

<p align="center"><b>Elliott(1983-1999) 542</b></p><p><b>542.</b>
In the case of those who are brought into heaven so that they may know the nature of it, either their physical impulses and false notions are lulled to sleep - for nobody can enter heaven with physical 
impulses and false notions which they bring with them from the world - or else they are encircled by spirits who moderate in a miraculous fashion those things that are unclean and cause dissension. 
With some the interiors of their being are opened. These things and others are what they experience according to the lives they have led and their resulting dispositions.  </p>

<p align="center"><b>Latin(1748-1756) 542</b>
</p><b>542.</b>
Qui auferuntur in caelum, sciendi causa quale sit, iis, vel sopiuntur corporea et phantasiae, nam cum corporeis et phantasiis quae ex mundo secum trahunt, nemo intrare potest in caelum: vel sphaera 
spirituum circumdantur, quibus temperantur miraculose ea quae immunda sunt: et quae dissensum faciunt: quibusdam aperiuntur interiora; ita et aliter, secundum eorum vitas et inde tractas indoles. </p>
