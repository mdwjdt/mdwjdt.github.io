<h3 align="center" class="ired">属天的奥秘 第4918节</h3>
<h4 align="center"></h4><p><strong>4918.</strong>“看哪，她腹里是一对双生”表教会的两大要素。这从“双生”和“腹”的含义清楚可知：“双生”是指这二者，即良善与真理（<a href="3299.htm">3299</a>节）；“腹”（即子宫）是指良善与真理被孕育和躺卧之地，因而是指教会的基本要素躺卧之地。“腹”在真正意义上表示有纯真在其中的婚姻之爱的至内层，因为在大人中，子宫或腹对应于这爱。由于婚姻之爱起源于对良善与真理的爱，这爱属于天堂的婚姻，在该婚姻的心脏处，还由于这婚姻就是天堂本身，或主的国度，而主在地上的国度是教会，所以“腹”或子宫也表示教会。因为教会在良善与真理的婚姻所在之处。正因如此，“打开子宫”表示由此衍生的教会教义（<a href="3856.htm">3856</a>节），以及接受教会的真理与良善的能力（<a href="3967.htm">3967</a>节）；“从腹（或子宫）中出来或出胎”表示再生或重生（参看<a href="4904.htm">4904</a>节），也就是被作出一个教会，因为凡再生或重生者，都被作成一个教会。<br />由于“从腹中出来或出胎”表示重生，因而表示教会，所以主在圣言中被称为“从出胎造就人的”、“叫人出母腹的”；经上称那些重生并被作成一个教会的人为“出胎”（经上或译出母胎，离母腹等），如以赛亚书：<br />造作你，又从你出胎造就你，并要帮助你的耶和华如此说。（以赛亚书<a href="http://39-27.cn/赛44.2.htm">44:2</a>）<br /><br />从你出胎，造就你的救赎主耶和华如此说。（以赛亚书<a href="http://39-27.cn/赛44.24.htm">44:24</a>）<br /><br />耶和华从我出胎，造就我作他的仆人，要使雅各归向祂，使以色列到祂那里聚集。（以赛亚书<a href="http://39-27.cn/赛49.5.htm">49:5</a>）<br />诗篇：<br />叫我出母腹的耶和华。（诗篇<a href="http://39-27.cn/诗22.9.htm">22:9</a>）<br />以赛亚书：<br />雅各家、以色列家一切余剩的要听我言，你们自从生下，就蒙我保抱；自从出胎，便蒙我怀搋。（以赛亚书<a href="http://39-27.cn/赛46.3.htm">46:3</a>）<br />诗篇：<br />恶人一出母胎，就疏远；一离母腹，便走错路，说谎话。（诗篇<a href="http://39-27.cn/诗58.3.htm">58:3</a>）<br />此处“一出母胎，就疏远”表示与教会所培育的良善疏远，“一离母腹，便走错路”表示偏离真理。何西阿书：<br />产妇的疼痛必临到他身上；他是无智慧之子，到了产期还是迟延于子宫口。（何西阿书<a href="http://39-27.cn/何13.13.htm">13:13</a>）<br />此处“迟延于子宫口”表示未处于教会所培育的真理之良善。<br /><br />他们的荣耀必如鸟飞去，必不生产，不怀胎，不成孕。（何西阿书<a href="http://39-27.cn/何9.11.htm">9:11</a>）<br />这表示教会的真理将完全灭亡；“生产”表示出生或诞生，“怀胎”表示正在孕育；“成孕”表示开始或正在产生。以赛亚书：<br />我原知道你行事极其诡诈，你自从出胎以来，便称为悖逆的。（以赛亚书<a href="http://39-27.cn/赛48.8.htm">48:8</a>）<br />这表示自教会开始之时，这就是他们的品质。启示录：<br />天上现出大异象来。有一个妇人，身披日头，脚踏月亮，头戴十二星的冠冕。她怀了孩子，在生产的艰难中疼痛呼叫。（启示录<a href="http://39-27.cn/启12.1.htm">12:1</a>-<a href="http://39-27.cn/启12.2.htm">2</a>）<br />“妇人”是指教会（<a href="252.htm">252</a>，<a href="253.htm">253</a>，<a href="255.htm">255</a>节）；她所披的“日头”是指爱之良善（<a href="30.htm">30</a>-<a href="38.htm">38</a>，<a href="1529.htm">1529</a>，<a href="1530.htm">1530</a>，<a href="2441.htm">2441</a>，<a href="2495.htm">2495</a>，<a href="4060.htm">4060</a>，<a href="4696.htm">4696</a>节）；她脚踏的“月亮”是指信之真理（<a href="30.htm">30</a>-<a href="38.htm">38</a>，<a href="1529.htm">1529</a>，<a href="1530.htm">1530</a>，<a href="2120.htm">2120</a>，<a href="2495.htm">2495</a>，<a href="4696.htm">4696</a>节）；“星”是指对良善与真理的认知（<a href="2495.htm">2495</a>，<a href="2849.htm">2849</a>，<a href="4697.htm">4697</a>节）；之所以有“十二星”，是因为“十二”表示全部，因而表示信的全部事物（<a href="577.htm">577</a>，<a href="2089.htm">2089</a>，<a href="2129.htm">2129</a>，<a href="2130.htm">2130</a>，<a href="3272.htm">3272</a>，<a href="3858.htm">3858</a>，<a href="3913.htm">3913</a>节）；“怀了孩子”表示所孕育的教会真理；“在生产的艰难中疼痛呼叫”表示它被艰难接受的事实。</p>

And behold twins were in her womb. That this signifies both things of the church, is evident from the signification of "twins," as being both good and truth (n. 3299); and from the signification of the 
"womb," as being where good and truth lie conceived, consequently, where that is which is of the church. The "womb" in the genuine sense signifies the inmost of conjugial love in which is innocence, 
because in the Grand Man the womb corresponds to this love; and as conjugial love has its origin from the love of good and truth which belongs to the heavenly marriage, and as this marriage is heaven 
itself, or the Lord's kingdom, and as the Lord's kingdom on earth is the church, therefore the church also is signified by the "womb;" for the church is where the marriage of good and truth is. For 
this reason it is that "opening the womb" denotes the derivative doctrines of churches (n. 3856), and also the capacity to receive the truths and goods of the church (n. 3967); and that "coming forth 
from the womb" denotes to be reborn or regenerated (see n. 4904), that is, to be made a church, for whoever is reborn or regenerated is made a church. [2] As rebirth, and hence the church, are signified 
by "going forth from the womb," therefore the Lord is called in the Word, "He that formeth from the womb," "He that bringeth forth from the womb;" and they who are regenerated and made a church are 
said to be "carried from the womb," as in Isaiah: </p>
<p>     Thus said Jehovah thy Maker, He that formeth thee from the womb, He helpeth thee (Isa. 44:2). Again: </p>
<p>     Thus said Jehovah thy Redeemer, and 
He that formed thee from the womb (Isa. 44:24). Again: </p>
<p>     Said Jehovah that formed me from the womb to be His servant, to bring Jacob again to Him, and that Israel be gathered unto Him (Isa. 49:5) In 
David: </p>
<p>     Jehovah who brought me forth from the womb (Ps. 22:9). Again in Isaiah: </p>
<p>     Attend to Me, O house of Jacob, and all the remains of the house of Israel, carried from the womb and 
borne from the matrix (Isa. 46:3). In David: </p>
<p>     The wicked are estranged from the womb; they go astray from the belly, with words of a lie (Ps. 58:3); </p>
<p>where "being estranged from the womb" means 
from the good which is of the church, and "going astray from the belly" means going astray from truth. In Hosea: </p>
<p>     The pangs of a travailing woman shall come upon him; he is an unwise son, for at 
the time he standeth not In the womb of sons (Hos. 13:13); </p>
<p>where "not standing in the womb of sons" means not being in the good of truth which is of the church. [3] Again: </p>
<p>     Their glory shall fly 
away like a bird; from the birth, from the belly, and from conception (Hos. 9:11); </p>
<p>meaning that the truth of the church will entirely perish; "from the birth" meaning what is born; "from the belly," 
what is in gestation; "from conception," what is begun. In Isaiah: </p>
<p>     I knew that thou wouldest deal very treacherously, and wast called a transgressor from the womb (Isa. 48:8); </p>
<p>meaning that such 
was their quality from the beginning of the church. In Revelation: </p>
<p>     A great sign was seen in heaven, a woman encompassed with the sun, and the moon under her feet, and upon her head a crown of 
twelve stars; and she bearing in the belly, cried out,  travailing in birth, and in pain to be delivered (Rev. 12:1-2); </p>
<p>the "woman" is the church (n. 252, 253, 255); the "sun with which she was encompassed" 
is the good of love (n. 30-38, 1529, 1530, 2441, 2495, 4060, 4696); the "moon which was under her feet" is the truth of faith (n. 30-38, 1529, 1530, 2120, 2495, 4696); the "stars" are the knowledges 
of good and truth (n. 2495, 2849, 4697); that there were "twelve" stars is because "twelve" means all, and thus all things of faith (n. 577, 2089, 2129, 2130, 3272, 3858, 3913); "bearing in 
the belly" means the truth of the church conceived; "travailing in birth and in pain to be delivered" means that it was received with difficulty. </p>

<p align="center"><b>Elliott(1983-1999) 4918</b></p><p><b>4918.</b>
'That behold, there were twins in her womb' means the two essentials of the Church. This is clear from the meaning of 'twine' as the two - good and truth - dealt with in <a href="3299.htm">3299</a>; and from the meaning of 
'the womb' as the place where good and truth have been conceived and are lying, and consequently the place where the essentials of the Church are lying. In the genuine sense 'the womb' means the inmost 
centre of conjugial love where innocence is present, for the womb corresponds to that love in the Grand Man. Now because conjugial love has its origin in the love of good and truth, which love is at 
the heart of the heavenly marriage, and because this marriage is heaven itself or the Lord's kingdom, and the Lord's kingdom on earth is the Church, therefore 'the womb' also means the Church. For the 
Church exists where the marriage of good and truth exists. This explains why 'opening the womb' means the resulting doctrines taught by the Churches, <a href="3856.htm">3856</a>, as well as the ability to receive the truths 
and goods of the Church, <a href="3967.htm">3967</a>; while 'going out of the womb' means being born again or being regenerated, <a href="4904.htm">4904</a>, that is, becoming the Church since one who is born again or regenerated becomes the 
Church. </p>
<p></p>
<p><b>[2]</b>
 Since 'going out of the womb' means rebirth, and therefore the Church, the Lord is called in the Word 'He who formed from the womb' and 'He who brought out of the womb', and those who have 
been regenerated and become the Church are said 'to have been carried from the womb', as in Isaiah, </p>
<blockquote>
Thus said Jehovah. your Maker. He who formed you from the womb, and who helps you. <a href="http://bible.gospelcom.net/cgi-bin/bible?passage=Isa%2044:2&amp;version=ESV&amp;interface=print&amp;showfn=yes&amp;showxref">Isa 44:2</a>. 
</blockquote>
<p>In 
the same prophet, </p>
<blockquote>
Thus said Jehovah, your Redeemer, He who formed you from the womb. <a href="http://bible.gospelcom.net/cgi-bin/bible?passage=Isa%2044:24&amp;version=ESV&amp;interface=print&amp;showfn=yes&amp;showxref">Isa 44:24</a>. 
</blockquote>
<p>In the same prophet, </p>
<blockquote>
Thus said Jehovah. who formed me from the womb to be His servant, 
to bring back Jacob to Him, and that Israel might be gathered to Him. <a href="http://bible.gospelcom.net/cgi-bin/bible?passage=Isa%2049:5&amp;version=ESV&amp;interface=print&amp;showfn=yes&amp;showxref">Isa 49:5</a>. 
</blockquote>
<p>In David, </p>
<blockquote>
Jehovah who brought me out of the womb. <a href="http://bible.gospelcom.net/cgi-bin/bible?passage=Ps%2022:9&amp;version=ESV&amp;interface=print&amp;showfn=yes&amp;showxref">Ps 22:9</a>. 
</blockquote>
<p>In Isaiah, </p>
<blockquote>
Hearken to Me, O house of Jacob, and 
all the remnant of the house of Israel who have been carried from the womb, and borne from the belly. <a href="http://bible.gospelcom.net/cgi-bin/bible?passage=Isa%2046:3&amp;version=ESV&amp;interface=print&amp;showfn=yes&amp;showxref">Isa 46:3</a>. 
</blockquote>
<p>In David, </p>
<blockquote>
The wicked are alienated from the womb, and go astray from the belly, 
with lying words. <a href="http://bible.gospelcom.net/cgi-bin/bible?passage=Ps%2058:3&amp;version=ESV&amp;interface=print&amp;showfn=yes&amp;showxref">Ps 58:3</a>. 
</blockquote>
<p>Here 'being alienated from the womb' means alienation from the good fostered by the Church, and 'going astray from the belly' straying from the truth. In Hosea, </p>
<blockquote>
The pains 
of childbirth will come upon him, he is an unwise son, for now he does not present himself at the womb of sons. <a href="http://bible.gospelcom.net/cgi-bin/bible?passage=Hosea%2013:13&amp;version=ESV&amp;interface=print&amp;showfn=yes&amp;showxref">Hosea 13:13</a>. 
</blockquote>
<p>'Not presenting himself at the womb of sons' stands for not coming 
to the good of truth fostered by the Church. </p>
<p></p>
<p><b>[3]</b>
 In the same prophet, </p>
<blockquote>
Their glory will fly away like a bird, away from birth, from the belly, and from conception. <a href="http://bible.gospelcom.net/cgi-bin/bible?passage=Hosea%209:11&amp;version=ESV&amp;interface=print&amp;showfn=yes&amp;showxref">Hosea 9:11</a>. 
</blockquote>
<p>This means that 
the truth of the Church will perish fully - 'from birth' being that to which birth is given, 'from the belly' that which is undergoing gestation, 'from conception' that which is taking rise. In Isaiah, </p>
<blockquote>
I 
knew that you would certainly act treacherously, and that you were called [a man] of transgression from the womb. <a href="http://bible.gospelcom.net/cgi-bin/bible?passage=Isa%2048:8&amp;version=ESV&amp;interface=print&amp;showfn=yes&amp;showxref">Isa 48:8</a>. 
</blockquote>
<p>This means that from the time when the Church first began he was like 
this. In John, </p>
<blockquote>
A great sign was seen in heaven - a woman clothed with the sun, and the moon under her feet. and on her head a crown of twelve stars Carrying in the belly however, she cried out 
in labour, and was in anguish to give birth. <a href="http://bible.gospelcom.net/cgi-bin/bible?passage=Rev%2012:1,%202&amp;version=ESV&amp;interface=print&amp;showfn=yes&amp;showxref">Rev 12:1, 2</a>. 
</blockquote>
<p>'The woman' is the Church, <a href="252.htm">252</a>, <a href="253.htm">253</a>, <a href="255.htm">255</a>. 'The sun' with which she was clothed is the good of love, <a href="30.htm">30</a>-<a href="38.htm">38</a>, <a href="1529.htm">1529</a>, <a href="1530.htm">1530</a>, <a href="2441.htm">2441</a>, <a href="2495.htm">2495</a>, <a href="4060.htm">4060</a>, <a href="4696.htm">4696</a>;

'twelve' means all things, thus all aspects of faith, <a href="577.htm">577</a>, <a href="2089.htm">2089</a>, <a href="2129.htm">2129</a> (end), <a href="2130.htm">2130</a> (end), <a href="3272.htm">3272</a>, <a href="3858.htm">3858</a>, <a href="3913.htm">3913</a>; 'carrying in the belly' is the truth of the Church that had been conceived; 'being in labour 
and in anguish to give birth' is the fact that it was received with difficulty. </p>
