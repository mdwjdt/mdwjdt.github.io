<h3 align="center" class="ired">属天的奥秘 第9581节</h3>
<h4 align="center"></h4><p><strong>9581.</strong>那些陷入身体感官，并出于它们思考的人无法被引导相信，这种事曾经发生过。原因在于，身体感官无法理解脱离空间的旅行。然而，那些出于其灵的感官思考，多少有点远离或退离身体感官，从而在更内在的层次上如此思考的人，则能被引导相信并理解，这种事已经发生，因为他们思维观念里既没有空间，也没有时间，取而代之的是诸如系空间和时间之源头的那类事物。因此，接下来有关星空中诸星球的内容是讲给后一种人的，而不是讲给前一种人的，除非他们是那种能允许自己接受教导的人。</p>

<p align="center"><b>Potts(1905-1910) 9581</b></p><p><b>9581.</b>
That this has been done, no one who is in the sensuous things of the body, and who thinks from them, can be brought to believe. The reason is that these sensuous things cannot grasp progressions apart 
from spaces. Nevertheless they who think from the sensuous of their spirit somewhat removed or withdrawn from that of the body, thus they who think interiorly within themselves, can be brought to believe 
and to apprehend it, because in the idea of their thought there is neither space  nor time, but instead of these such things as are the sources of spaces and times. Therefore the things which follow 
concerning the earths in the starry heaven are for these men, and not for those first mentioned, unless they are of such a character as to suffer themselves to be instructed. </p>

<p align="center"><b>Elliott(1983-1999) 9581</b></p><p><b>9581.</b>
Those who are ruled by their bodily senses and think on the level of those senses cannot be led to believe that such a thing has ever happened. The reason for this is that the bodily senses can have 
no conception of a journey other than one that is made through intervals of space. Those however who think on the sensory level of their spirit, when that level has been removed or withdrawn to some extent 
from the sensory level of the body, and so think on a more internal level, can be led to believe and conceive that such a thing has happened, because space and time do not come into the idea formed 
in their mind, but instead of space and time the kinds of realities which are the cause behind all that is spatial and temporal. Let the information that follows therefore regarding planets in the 
starry sky be for the latter kind of people and not for the former, unless they are such as allow themselves to receive instruction.  </p>

</p><b>9581.</b>
Quod ita factum sit, illi qui in sensualibus corporeis sunt, et ex illis cogitant, non induci possunt ad credendum; causa est quia sensualia corporea non possunt capere progressiones absque spatiis; 
at usque illi qui ex sensuali spiritus sui aliquantum remoto seu subducto a sensuali corporis, ita interius in se, cogitant, induci possunt et capere, quoniam in idea cogitationis eorum non est spatium, 
nec tempus, sed pro illis talia ex quibus spatia et tempora; pro his itaque sint haec quae sequuntur de telluribus in caelo astrifero, et non pro illis, nisi tales sint ut se instrui patiantur. </p>
