<h3 align="center" class="ired">属天的奥秘 第5723节</h3>
<h4 align="center"></h4><p><strong>5723.</strong>与我同在的灵人引发严重的胃压迫，使我觉得自己几乎活不下去了。这种压迫如此之大，以致它会使其他人昏厥。不过，这些灵人被移走了，然后疼痛立刻消失。我被告知，他们就是活在肉身时对什么也不感兴趣，甚至对自己的家也不感兴趣，唯独专注于感官欲乐的那类灵人。他们过着可耻地懒散、无所作为的生活，对别人毫不关心。此外，他们还蔑视一切信仰。简言之，他们只是动物，不是人类。在病人当中，这些灵人发出的气场会在他们患病的肢体和关节处造成疲弱、麻木。</p>

<p align="center"><b>Potts(1905-1910) 5723</b></p><p><b>5723.</b>
There were spirits with me who induced so severe an oppression in the stomach that I seemed to myself scarcely able to live. The oppression was so great that with others it would have brought on a swoon. 
But they were removed, and then it at once ceased. I was told that such spirits are they who in the life of the body had been devoted to no pursuit, not even at home, but solely to pleasure, and 
besides had lived in foul idleness and sloth, and had not cared anything for others. Moreover they had despised the faith. In short, they had been animals, not men. The sphere of such produces numbness 
in the members and joints of the sick. </p>

<p align="center"><b>Elliott(1983-1999) 5723</b></p><p><b>5723.</b>
Spirits have been present with me who brought on a stomachache so bad that I felt I could scarcely live; it was such as would have caused other people to faint. But those spirits were removed and the 
ache immediately ceased. I was told that they were the kind of spirits who during their lifetime had had no interest in anything at all, not even in their own home, only in sensual pleasure. They had 
led disgracefully lazy and inactive lives, showing no concern whatsoever for others. They had also cast all belief aside with contempt. In short, they were simply animals, not human beings. Among people 
who are sick the sphere emanating from those spirits introduces sluggishness into their members and limbs. </p>

<p align="center"><b>Latin(1748-1756) 5723</b>
</p><b>5723.</b>
Fuerunt apud me spiritus qui gravedinem talem ventriculo induxerunt ut viderer mihi vix posse vivere; talis gravedo erat ut apud alios induxisset deliquium; sed remoti sunt, et tunc statim cessabat; 
dictum quod tales spiritus illi sint qui in vita corporis nullo studio, ne quidem domestico, dediti fuerint, sed solum voluptati et praeterea in foedo otio et inertia vixerunt, nec alios curaverunt quicquam; 
fidem etiam spreverunt; in summa, fuerunt animalia non homines; talium sphaera apud aegrotos torporem membris et artubus inducit. </p>
