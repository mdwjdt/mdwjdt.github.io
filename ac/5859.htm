<h3 align="center" class="ired">属天的奥秘 第5859节</h3>
<h4 align="center"></h4><p><strong>5859.</strong>一些灵人上升来到我这里，声称他们从一开始就与我同在，并不知道别的。但当我向他们说明情况正好相反时，他们最终承认，他们这是第一次来；但他们因立刻就披上或取得我记忆里的一切，故不可能知道别的。这也向他们证明，灵人一来到人这里，就会立刻披上或取得此人的一切记忆知识，好像这些记忆知识是他们自己的；而且当许多灵人同在时，他们当中的每一个都会披上或取得这些知识，并且都以为这些知识是他们自己的。人死后立刻拥有这种能力。这也解释了为何当善灵进入天堂社群时，他们就会披上或取得并拥有那个社群中所有人的全部智慧。这就是在他们中间所进行的共享的性质，尽管他们活在肉身时，对他们在该天堂社群所谈论的那类事一无所知。如果他们在世时过着充满良善的仁爱生活，这种情形就会发生。这种良善拥有将智慧的全部归于自己的能力在里面，因为真正的良善里面藏有智慧。正因如此，他们仿佛本能地知道肉身生活期间无法理解，甚至无法描述的事。</p>

Some spirits came to me by ascending, and said that they had been with me from the beginning, knowing no otherwise. But when I showed them to the contrary, they at last confessed that they had now come 
for the first time, but because they had at once put on all things of my memory, they could know no otherwise. From this again it was evident that when spirits come to a man they instantly put on all 
the man's memory-knowledges as if they were their own; and also that when a number of spirits are present, they each of them put on these knowledges, and they each of them suppose that they are their 
own. Into this faculty comes man immediately after death. Hence also it is that when good spirits come into a heavenly society, they put on and possess all the wisdom of all in that society-for such 
is the communion-and this although in the life of the body they had known nothing whatever of such things as are said in the heavenly society. This is the case if when in the world they had lived in 
the good of charity, for this good is attended with the appropriation to itself of everything of wisdom, because this is secretly implanted in good itself; and it is from this that they know as it were 
from themselves things which in the bodily life had been incomprehensible and even unutterable. </p>

Some spirits moving upwards once came to me, saying that they had been with me right from the start; they knew nothing different. But because I showed them the opposite was so, they at length confessed 
they had arrived only just then; and because they instantly took to themselves everything in my memory, they could not have known anything different. This also proved to them that the moment spirits 
arrive they take to themselves all the knowledge a person has, as if it were their own; and also that when many spirits are present each one takes it to himself and imagines it to be his own. This ability 
is one that a person comes to possess immediately after death. This also explains why within a heavenly community into which they come good spirits take to themselves and come to possess the entire 
wisdom that everyone possesses in that community. This is what the sharing that takes place among them is like even though during their lifetime they had no knowledge at all of the kinds of matters 
they talk about in that heavenly community. This happens to them if in the world they had led charitable lives filled with goodness. This goodness holds within itself the ability to embrace the whole 
of wisdom as its own, for real goodness has wisdom concealed within it. Consequently they have a kind of innate knowledge of things which during their lifetime were beyond understanding, indeed beyond 
description. </p>

Spiritus {1}quidam ad me venerunt, ascendendo, dicentes quod apud me fuissent a principio, non aliud scientes; sed quia contrarium illis demonstrabam, tandem fassi sunt quod nunc primum venissent, et 
quia omnia memoriae meae ilico induerunt, quod non {2}aliud potuissent scire; inde constabat quoque quod spiritus momento cum adveniunt, omnia scientifica hominis sicut sua induant; etiam cum plures 
spiritus adsunt, singuli induunt, et singuli putant quod sua sint; in hanc facultatem venit homo statim post mortem. Inde quoque est quod spiritus boni in {3}caelesti societate in quam veniunt, induant 
et possideant omnem sapientiam quae est omnium in illa societate; talis enim est communio, et hoc tametsi in vita corporis prorsus nihil ex talibus quae in societate caelesti dicuntur, noverant; hoc 
fit si in bono charitatis in mundo vixerant; bonum hoc secum habet quod approprietur ei omne sapientiae, nam in ipso bono hoc latet insitum; {4}inde quasi ex se sciunt, quae in vita corporis incomprehensibilia, 
immo ineffabilia, fuerunt. @1 aliqui$ @2 aliter$ @3 i omni$ @4 ita tale et quod ei incomprehensibile in vita corporis, imo quod ineffabile fuerat.$ </p>
