<h3 align="center" class="ired">属天的奥秘 第2290节</h3>
<h4 align="center"></h4><p><strong>2290.</strong>对死后生命状态一无所知的人可能以为小孩子一进入来世就会获得天使般的聪明智慧，但我通过大量经历得知，情况根本不是这样。那些出生后不久即死去的人具有婴儿般的心智，几乎和世上的一样。他们所知也不会更多，因为他们仅具有认知能力，然后通过认知能力拥有理解力，再通过理解力拥有变得智慧的能力。这种能力日益完善，因为他们活在灵里，而非肉身中。这就是小孩子刚进入天堂时的情形。这一点不仅向我告知，还向我显明。因为有几次蒙主的神圣怜悯，唱诗班的孩子被送到我这里，我还被允许给他们朗读主祷文，同时得以觉察陪伴他们的天使如何将主祷文的内容意义注入他们稚嫩和新形成的观念中，并照着小孩子的接受程度将其充满他们。然后，我又觉察到小孩子如何被赋予仿佛凭自己思想诸如此类事物的能力。</p>

They who know nothing about the state of the life after death may suppose that little children are in angelic intelligence and wisdom as soon as they come into the other life; but I have been instructed 
by much experience that such is not the case. Those who die not long after birth are of an infantile mind, almost as on earth, nor do they know anything more; for they possess only the faculty of 
knowing, and from this of understanding, and from this of being wise; which faculty is more perfect because they are not in the body, but are spirits. That they are so when they first come into heaven, 
has not merely been told, but has also been shown me; for of the Lord's Divine mercy little children have on several occasions been sent to me in choirs, and I have also been allowed to read to them 
the Lord's Prayer; and at the same time I have been given to perceive how the angels in whose company they were, insinuated into their tender and novitiate ideas the meaning of the things which are in 
this Prayer, and filled them, so far as the little ones were able to receive; and afterwards how the capacity was given the little ones of thinking such things as it were from themselves. </p>

People who know nothing about the state of the life after death may think that young children acquire angelic intelligence and wisdom the moment they enter the next life. But I have learned through much 
experience that this is not so at all. Those who die not long after birth have the minds of young children, almost the same as on earth. Nor is the amount of what they know any greater, for they possess 
no more than the capacity to know, and from this to have intelligence and from this to be wise. Yet that capacity is more perfect because they are not living in the body but are spirits. That this 
is the mental condition of young children when they first enter heaven I have not merely been told but have also been shown, for on several occasions, in the Lord's Divine mercy, groups of young children 
have been sent to me, and I have been allowed to read the Lord's Prayer to them. As I did so I was given to perceive how the angels whose company they were in were instilling into their tender 
and newly-formed ideas the meaning of the things that are in the Lord's Prayer- filling their ideas with it in the measure that the young children were able to receive it - and after that how the young 
children were given the capacity to think about things such as these as if from themselves. </p>

Qui nihil de statu vitae post mortem sciunt, opinari possunt quod infantes, ilico dum in alteram vitam veniunt, in intelligentia et sapientia angelica sint; sed quod aliter se habeat, per multam experientiam 
instructus sum; qui non diu post nativitatem obeunt, sunt infantili mente paene sicut {1} in terra nec quicquam plus sciunt, modo enim secum habent facultatem sciendi, ex {2} hac intelligendi, 
et ex hac sapiendi, quae facultas perfectior est quia non in corpore sunt sed sunt spiritus: quod tales sint cum primum in caelum veniunt, non modo mihi dictum est sed etiam ostensum; aliquibus enim 
vicibus, ex Divina Domini Misericordia, ad me infantes in choris missi sunt, et concessum quoque praelegere illis Orationem Domini, et simul tunc datum percipere quomodo angeli in quorum consortio fuerunt, 
in teneras et novitias illorum ideas sensum rerum quae in Oratione Domini, insinuarent, et illas quantum recipere potuerunt, implere; et dein quomodo illis data copia cogitandi similia sicut ex 
se. 	@1 sunt.$ 	@2 i et.$ </p>
