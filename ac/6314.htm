<h3 align="center" class="ired">属天的奥秘 第6314节</h3>
<h4 align="center"></h4><p><strong>6314.</strong>光如何，作为人的生命之热的热也如何。这种生命之热决非源于这个世界的太阳所散发的热；它源于属灵之热，属灵之热是爱，是从主发出的；天使便拥有这热。因此，一个人所拥有的生命之热的量取决于他所拥有的爱的量。然而，他的身体处于尘世之热，其身体里面的感官意识也是；不过，生命之热流入尘世之热，并赋予它生命。这热在纯度和强度上的不同类似光在清晰度上的不同。在圣言中，圣火指的就是这生命之热，所以这些火表示天堂的爱。但就反面意义而言，地狱之火指的是尘世之热，所以在圣言中，这些火表示地狱之爱及其欲望。</p>

As it is with light, so also it is with the heat which is man's vital heat. This vital heat does not in the slightest degree derive its origin from the heat which is from the sun of this world; but from 
spiritual heat, which is love, and which proceeds from the Lord: the angels have this heat. Hence so far as man is in love, so far he is in vital heat. The body, however, is in the heat of the world, 
and so is the interior sensuous; but the vital heat flows into this heat and vivifies it. The purities and the grossnesses of this heat are circumstanced in the same way as are the lights. It is this 
heat which is meant by the holy fires in the Word, and therefore by these fires are there signified heavenly loves. But in the opposite sense it is this heat which is meant by the fires of hell, and 
therefore by these fires in the Word are signified infernal loves and their cupidities. </p>

As it is with light, so it is with the heat that is vital to a person's existence. In no way at all does that vital heat originate in the heat radiated by the sun in the world; rather, it originates 
in spiritual heat, which is love and radiates from the Lord. This heat is what angels have. Consequently the amount of vital heat a person has is determined by the amount of love he has. His body however 
is warmed by worldly heat, as is his sensory awareness within it; yet vital heat flows into that worldly heat and imparts life to it. Differences in the purity and intensity of this heat are akin 
to variations in the clarity of the light. This vital heat is what one should understand by the holy fires mentioned in the Word, and therefore heavenly loves are meant by those fires. But in a contrary 
sense that worldly heat is what one should understand by the fires of hell, and therefore hellish loves and the desires that go with them are meant when these fires are mentioned in the Word. </p>

Similiter ac cum luce se quoque habet cum calore qui homini vitalis {1}est; calor hic vitalis prorsus non originem trahit a calore qui e sole mundi, sed a calore spirituali qui est amor, {2}et procedit 
a Domino; hic calor est angelis; inde homo quantum in amore est, tantum in calore vitali est; corpus autem est in calore mundi, et quoque sensuale interius, sed calor vitalis influit in hunc calorem 
et vivificat illum; puritates et crassities ejus se similiter habent ac luces.  {m}Hic calor est qui intelligitur per ignes sacros in Verbo, {3}quapropter per ignes illos ibi significantur caelestes 
amores; ac in opposito sensu est ille calor qui intelligitur per ignes inferni, {4}quare per ignes illos in Verbo significantur amores infernales et eorum cupiditates.(n) @1 before homini$ @2 qui$ @3
