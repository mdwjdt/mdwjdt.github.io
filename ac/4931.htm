<h4 align="center"></h4><p><h4 align="center">关于与大人的对应关系（续）</h4><br />此处关于手、臂、脚、腰与大人的关系<br />【节】4931.前面早已说明，整个天堂都与一个人及其各个器官、肢体、脏腑有相似之处。还说明，之所以如此，是因为天堂与主有关；事实上，主是天堂全部中的全部，以致严格来说，天堂本质上是从主所接受的神性良善与神性真理。因此，天堂划分众多区域，可以说和人的脏腑、器官、肢体一样多，并与这些也有一种对应关系。除非人与天堂，并通过天堂与主具有这样一种对应关系，否则人片刻不能存活。所有这些事物都通过流注彼此保持联系。<br />不过，所有这些区域都与两个国度有关，即属天国度和属灵国度。属天国度是大人里面心脏的国度，属灵国度是肺脏的国度。和在人里面一样，这心脏和肺脏在大人的每一个部分中占据主导地位。这两个国度以神奇的方式结合起来；这种结合就体现在人里面心脏与肺脏的结合，以及它们在各个肢体和内脏的运作的结合中。</p>

CONTINUATION CONCERNING THE  CORRESPONDENCE WITH THE GRAND  MAN, HERE CONCERNING THE CORRESPONDENCE OF THE HANDS, ARMS, FEET, AND LOINS THEREWITH. It has been already shown that the whole heaven has 
reference to one Man with his several organs, members, and viscera; and this because heaven has reference to the Lord, for the Lord is the all in all of heaven, insomuch that heaven is in the proper 
sense the Divine good and Divine truth which are from the Lord. For this reason heaven is distinguished into as many provinces, so to speak, as there are viscera, organs, and members in man, and with 
these also there is correspondence. Unless there were such a correspondence of man with heaven, and through heaven with the Lord, man would not subsist even a single moment. All these things are kept 
in connection by influx. [2] But all these provinces have reference to two kingdoms - the celestial kingdom and the spiritual kingdom. The celestial kingdom is the kingdom of the heart in the Grand Man, 
and the spiritual kingdom is the kingdom of the lungs; in like manner as in man, in the whole and every part of whom reign the heart and the lungs. These two kingdoms are wonderfully conjoined; and 
this conjunction is represented in the conjunction of the heart and lungs in man, and in the conjunction of their operations in the several members and viscera. [3] While man is an embryo, or while 
he is yet in the womb, he is in the kingdom of the heart; but when he has come forth from the womb, he comes into the kingdom of the lungs; and if through the truths of faith he suffers himself to be 
brought into the good of love, he then returns from the kingdom of the lungs into the kingdom of the heart in the Grand Man; for he thus comes a second time into the womb and is born again. Then also 
these two kingdoms are conjoined in him, but in an inverted order; for previously the kingdom of the heart in him was under the rule of the lungs, that is, the truth of faith previously ruled in him; 
but afterward the good of charity rules. That the heart corresponds to the good of love, and the lungs to the truth of faith, may be seen above (n. 3635, 3883-3896). </p>

CORRESPONDENCE WITH THE GRAND MAN - continued IN THIS SECTION THE CORRESPONDENCE OF THE HANDS, THE ARMS, THE FEET, AND THE LOINS WITH IT </p>
<p>It has been shown already that the whole of heaven bears resemblance 
to a human being, together with each of his organs, members, and viscera. It has been shown too that this is so because heaven bears resemblance to the Lord; for the Lord is the All in all of 
heaven, so much its All that, properly speaking, heaven is essentially Divine Good and Divine Truth received from the Lord. For this reason heaven is distinguished into many so to speak separate provinces, 
as many as there are in a person's viscera, organs, and members, with which also there is a correspondence. Unless such a correspondence existed of the human being with heaven, and through heaven 
with the Lord, he could not remain in existence for even a single moment, all things being held in connection with one another by means of influx. </p>
<p></p>
<p><b>[2]</b>
 But all those provinces are linked to two 
kingdoms - the celestial kingdom and the spiritual kingdom. The first of these - the celestial kingdom - is the kingdom of the heart within the Grand Man; the second - the spiritual kingdom - is the kingdom 
of the lungs there. And in the same way as in the human being, the heart reigns, and so do the lungs, in every single part of the Grand Man. These two kingdoms combine in a marvellous way. Their 
combination likewise is represented in the combination of the heart and lungs in the human being, and in the combined workings of the two within each member and interior organ. </p>
<p></p>
<p><b>[3]</b>
 While a person 
is an embryo, that is, while still in the womb, he is in the kingdom of the heart. But once he has struggled out of the womb he enters the kingdom of the lungs. Then, if he allows the truths of faith 
to lead him into the good of love, he returns from the kingdom of the lungs within the Grand Man to the kingdom of the heart. For thereby he enters the womb a second time and is born again. Once again 
those two kingdoms become combined in him, but the order has been turned around. Previously the kingdom of the heart in him was under the control of the lungs, but now the kingdom of the lungs comes 
under the control of the heart. That is, first of all the truth of faith has dominion in him, but afterwards the good of charity does so. For the correspondence of the heart with the good of love and 
that of the lungs with the truth of faith, see <a href="3635.htm">3635</a>, <a href="3883.htm">3883</a>-<a href="3896.htm">3896</a>. </p>

Continuatio de Correspondentia cum Maximo Homine, hic de Correspondentia Manuum, Brachiorum, Pedum et Lumborum cum illo </p>
<p>Ostensum est prius quod universum caelum referat unum hominem cum singulis 
ejus organis, membris et visceribus; et hoc quia caelum refert Dominum, Dominus enim est omne in omnibus caeli, usque adeo ut caelum in proprio sensu sit Divinum Bonum et Divinum Verum quae a Domino; 
inde est quod caelum in tot {1} quasi provincias distinctum sit, quot sunt viscera, organa et membra in homine, cum quibus etiam correspondentia est; nisi correspondentia talis foret hominis cum 
caelo et per caelum cum Domino, (o)homo ne quidem uno momento subsisteret; omnia illa in connexu tenentur per influxum.  [2] Sed omnes illae provinciae se referunt ad duo regna, nempe ad regnum caeleste 
et ad regnum spirituale; illud regnum, nempe regnum caeleste, est regnum cordis in Maximo Homine, et hoc, nempe regnum spirituale, est regnum pulmonis ibi; similiter ac in homine, in ejus omnibus 
et singulis regnat cor, et regnat pulmo; </p>
<p>duo illa regna mirabiliter conjunguntur; conjunctio illa etiam repraesentatur in conjunctione cordis et pulmonis apud hominem, et in conjunctione operationum 
utriusque in singulis membris et visceribus.  [3] Cum homo est embryo, seu cum adhuc est in utero, tunc in regno cordis est, at cum enixus est ab utero, tunc simul venit in regnum pulmonis; 
et si is per vera fidei (t)patitur se perduci in bonum amoris, tunc a regno pulmonis redit in regnum cordis, (o)in Maximo Homine; sic enim iterum in uterum venit et renascitur; et tunc quoque apud 
illum conjunguntur {2} duo illa Regna, sed inverso ordine {3}; prius enim regnum cordis apud eum sub imperio pulmonum fuit, [sed tunc fit regnum pulmonum sub imperio cordis], hoc est, prius dominatum 
est apud illum fidei verum, sed postea dominatur charitatis bonam; quod `cor' correspondeat bono amoris, et `pulmo' vero fidei, videatur n. 3635, 3883-3896. @1 totidem$ @2 i iterum$ @3 modo$ </p>
