<h3 align="center" class="ired">属天的奥秘 第4385节</h3>
<h4 align="center"></h4><p><strong>4385.</strong>“以扫说，容我把跟随我的人留几个在你这里”表由良善之真理所提供的一些真理要被联结起来。这从“留在你这里”和“跟随我的人”的含义清楚可知：“留在你这里”是指结合；“跟随我的人”是指由良善之真理所提供的某些真理。“人”（即人民，people）表示真理（参看<a href="1259.htm">1259</a>，<a href="1260.htm">1260</a>，<a href="2928.htm">2928</a>，<a href="3295.htm">3295</a>，<a href="3581.htm">3581</a>节）；因此，“跟随我的人”表示良善之真理。前面多次阐述了何为良善的真理。它们就是那些从良善发出的真理，经由内在人流入外在人的良善就拥有这些真理在里面。以扫带来的那“四百人”就表示这些真理（参看<a href="4341.htm">4341</a>节）；所以，此处是指这些真理中的一些真理，因为经上说“跟随我的人留几个”。</p>

<p align="center"><b>Potts(1905-1910) 4385</b></p><p><b>4385.</b>
And Esau said, Let me set I pray with thee of the people that are with me. That this signifies that some things from the truth of good should be conjoined, is evident from the signification of "to set 
with thee," as being to conjoin; and from the signification of "the people that are with me," as being some things from the truth of good. That "people" denote truths, see above (n. 1259, 1260, 2928, 
3295, 3581); hence "the people that are with me" denote the truths of good. What the truths of good are, has already been stated several times. They are those truths which proceed from good, and which 
the good that flows in through the internal man into the external has with it. That these truths were signified by the "four hundred men" whom Esau had with him, may be seen above (n. 4341); here therefore 
are meant some of these truths, for it is said, "of the people that are with me." </p>

<p align="center"><b>Elliott(1983-1999) 4385</b></p><p><b>4385.</b>
'And Esau said, Let me now place with you some of the people who are with me' means that some truths supplied by the truth of good might be joined. This is clear from the meaning of 'placing with you' 
as joining together, and from the meaning of 'the people who are with me' as some truths supplied by the truth of good 'The people' means truths, see <a href="1259.htm">1259</a>, <a href="1260.htm">1260</a>, <a href="2928.htm">2928</a>, <a href="3295.htm">3295</a>, <a href="3581.htm">3581</a>; and therefore 'the 
people who are with me' means truths of good. What truths of good are has been stated a number of times already. They are those truths which proceed from good and which the good flowing in by way of 
the internal man into the external holds within itself. As regards those truths being meant by the four hundred men that Esau had with him, see above in <a href="4341.htm">4341</a>. At this point therefore some of those truths 
are meant since the expression 'some of the people who are with me' is used. </p>

<p align="center"><b>Latin(1748-1756) 4385</b>
</p><b>4385.</b>
`Et dixit Esau, Statuam quaeso cum te de populo qui mecum': </p>
<p>quod significet quod conjungerentur aliqua de boni vero, constat ex significatione `statuere cum te' quod sit conjungere; et ex significatione 
`populi qui mecum' quod sint aliqua de boni vero; </p>
<p>quod `populus' sint vera, videatur n. 1259, 1260, 2928, 3295, 3581; </p>
<p>inde `populus qui mecum' sunt boni vera; quid boni vera, aliquoties prius 
dictum est; sunt illa vera quae procedunt a bono, et quae bonum influens per internum hominem in externum secum habet; quod illa vera significata sint per `quadringentos viros quos Esau secum habebat', 
videatur supra n. 4341; hic ideo aliqua ex illis, nam dicitur `de populo qui mecum'. </p>
