<h3 align="center" class="ired">属天的奥秘 第9786节</h3>
<h4 align="center"></h4><p><strong>9786.</strong>“亚伦和他的儿子要经理这灯”表来自主的永恒流注。这从“经理”的含义清楚可知，“经理”当论及亚伦所代表的主时，是指流注。因为来自主的神性良善和神性真理的一切交流，以及与主的一切联结都通过流注实现，因为天使和世人是接受它的形式。之所以表示永恒的流注，是因为所论述的主题是从晚上到早晨经理这灯，以此表示不断和永恒。流注来自主的原因是，亚伦代表主的神性良善，而他的儿子代表主的神性真理；这些代表就是接下来的章节所论述的主题。</p>

Aaron and his sons shall order it. That this signifies perpetual influx from the Lord, is evident from the signification of "ordering," when said of the Lord, who was represented by Aaron, as being influx; 
for all communication of Divine good and Divine truth from the Lord, and all conjunction with Him, are effected through influx. Angels and men are recipient forms. That perpetual influx is signified, 
is because the subject treated of is the ordering of the lamp from evening until morning, by which is signified continually and perpetually. That the influx is from the Lord, is because by Aaron 
was represented the Lord as to Divine good, and by his sons the Lord as to Divine truth (of which in what follows). </p>

<p align="center"><b>Elliott(1983-1999) 9786</b></p><p><b>9786.</b>
'Aaron and his sons shall tend it' means an everlasting influx from the Lord. This is clear from the meaning of 'tending' - when it has regard to the Lord, who was represented by Aaron - as influx. For 
all communication of Divine Good and Divine Truth from the Lord, and all joining to Him is accomplished by influx, angels and men being the forms that receive it. The reason why an everlasting influx 
is meant is that tending the lamps from evening until morning, which means unceasingly and everlastingly, is the subject. The reason why from the Lord is meant is that Aaron represented the Lord's 
Divine Goodness, while his sons represented the Lord's Divine Truth; these representations are the subject in the chapters that follow.  </p>

<p align="center"><b>Latin(1748-1756) 9786</b>
</p><b>9786.</b>
`Ordinabit illud Aharon et filii ejus': quod significet perpetuum influxum a Domino, constat ex significatione `ordinare' cum de (x)Domino, Qui repraesentabatur per Aharonem, quod sit influxus, nam 
omnis communicatio Divini Boni et Divini Veri a Domino, et omnis conjunctio cum Ipso fit per influxum; sunt angeli et homines formae recipientes; quod influxus perpetuus significetur, est quia agitur 
de ordinatione lucernae a vespera usque ad mane, per quod significatur jugiter et perpetuo; quod a Domino, est quia per Aharonem repraesentabatur Dominus quoad Divinum Bonum, et per filios ejus quoad 
Divinum Verum, de quibus in sequentibus. </p>
