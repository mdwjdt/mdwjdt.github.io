<h3 align="center" class="ired">属天的奥秘 第5978节</h3>
<h4 align="center"></h4><p><strong>5978.</strong>之所以有两位天使与每个人同在，是因为天使也分为两种；一种作用于人意愿中的渴望，另一种作用于其理解力中的思维。作用人意愿中的渴望的天使作用于人的爱和目的，因而作用于他的良善意图。而作用于其理解力中的思维的天使，则作用于他的信仰和主要信念，因而作用于他的真理，或说他所拥有的正确观念。这两种彼此也完全不同。作用人意愿中的渴望的天使被称为属天的，而作用于其理解力中的思维的天使，被称为属灵的。魔鬼与属天天使相对立，灵人则与属灵天使相对立。大量经历使我得知这些事，因为我经常与双方的人在一起并与其交谈。</p>

<p align="center"><b>Potts(1905-1910) 5978</b></p><p><b>5978.</b>
That there are two angels with every man is because of these also there are two kinds, of which one act into what is of man's will, and the other into what is of his understanding. They who act into 
what is of man's will, act into his loves and ends, consequently into his goods. But they who act into what is of man's understanding, act into his faith and principles, consequently into his truths. 
These two kinds also are most distinct from each other. They who act into what is of man's will are called celestial, and they who act into what is of his understanding are called spiritual. To the celestial 
are opposed the genii, and to the spiritual the spirits. These things it has been given me to know by much experience, for I am continually in company and discourse with them both. </p>

<p align="center"><b>Elliott(1983-1999) 5978</b></p><p><b>5978.</b>
The reason two angels are present with each person is that there are also two kinds of angels; one kind acts on the desires in a person's will, the other on the thoughts in his understanding. Those acting 
on the desires in a person s will act on his loves and ends in view, consequently on his good intentions, whereas those acting on the thoughts in his understanding act on his faith and principal 
convictions, consequently on the true ideas he has. Those two kinds also are utterly distinct and separate. Those who act on the desires of a person's will are called celestial, while those who act on 
the thoughts in his understanding are called spiritual. The genii stand opposed to the celestial angels, the spirits to the spiritual ones. Much experience has led me to know these things; for I am 
constantly in the company of and talking to those from both sides.  </p>

<p align="center"><b>Latin(1748-1756) 5978</b>
</p><b>5978.</b>
Quod bini angeli apud unumquemvis hominem sint, est quia (t)illorum etiam duo genera sunt; unum quod agit in hominis voluntaria, alterum quod in ejus intellectualia; qui in hominis voluntaria, agunt 
in ejus amores et fines, consequenter in ejus bona; qui autem in hominis intellectualia, agunt in ejus fidem et principia, consequenter in ejus vera; sunt etiam illi inter se distinctissimi; vocantur 
illi qui in voluntaria hominis agunt caelestes, et illi qui in ejus intellectualia spirituales; caelestibus oppositi sunt genii, et spiritualibus spiritus{1}. (m)Haec a multa experientia scire datum 
est, nam cum utrisque continue sum in consortio et loquela.(n) @1 i sunt etiam hi separati ab invicem in caelis$ </p>
