<h3 align="center" class="ired">属天的奥秘 第2667节</h3>
<h4 align="center"></h4><p><strong>2667.</strong>本章1-7节论述的主题主的人性与其神性，并其神性与其人性的合一，以及主的人性如何通过这合一而变成神性。这几节的内容可参看前文（<a href="2649.htm">2649</a>节），此后论述的主题是纯人类理性，该理性要被分离出去（8节）；因为它与神圣理性不一致（9节）；并且无法拥有和神圣理性一样的生命，无论就真理而言，还是就良善而言（10节）；这种分离起初是主要感到忧伤的事（11节）；但祂通过神性发觉，人类无法以其它方式得救（12节）。接下来论述的主题是那些属于属灵教会的人，他们由被赶出后的夏甲的儿子来表示。</p>

From the first verse of this chapter to the seventh, the unition of the Lord's Human with His Divine, and of His Divine with His Human, has been treated of; and it has been shown that from that unition 
the Lord's Human was made Divine. The contents of the several verses may be seen above (n. 2649). From that point the merely human rational has been treated of, as being separated (verse 8); because 
it was not in agreement with the Divine Rational (verse 9); nor could it have a life in common with it, either as to truth or as to good (verse 10); that the separation was at first a grief to the Lord 
(verse 11); but that He perceived from the Divine that the human race could be saved in no other manner (verse 12). There now follows the subject of those who were of the spiritual church, who are 
signified by Hagar's son after he was sent away.      * * * * * * * * * * * * </p>

The subject in verses 1-7 of this chapter has been the Lord's Human existing united to His Divine, and His Divine united to His Human, and how from that union the Lord's Human was made Divine. For what 
each particular verse contains, see <a href="2649.htm">2649</a>. The subject after that was the merely human rational, that it was to be separated (verse 8), because it was not in agreement with the Divine Rational (verse 9), and could not possess the same life as the Divine Rational, neither as to truth nor as to good (verse 10); that at first that separation was something over which the Lord was to grieve (verse 11), 
but that from the Divine He perceived that there was no other way in which the human race could have been saved (verse 12). What follows next has to do with those who belonged to the spiritual Church 
and who are meant by Hagar's son after he had been sent away. </p>

Actum est a primo versu hujus capitis ad septimum de unitione Humani cum Divino, et Divini cum Humano, Domini, et quod ex unitione illa Humanum Domini Divinum factum; contenta singulorum versuum videantur 
n. 2649.  Deinde vers. 8, actum est de rationali mere humano, quod separaretur: vers. 9, quia non congruens esset Divino Rationali: vers. 10, nec cum hoc communem habere vitam posset, tam quoad 
verum quam quoad bonum: vers. 11, quod separat; primum dolori esset Domino: vers. 12, sed quod ex Divino perceperit genus humanum aliter salvari non potuisse. Nunc sequitur de illis qui ab Ecclesia spirituali, 
qui per `filium Hagaris, postquam ablegatus' significantur. 					*	*	* </p>
