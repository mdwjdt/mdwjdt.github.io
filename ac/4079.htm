<h3 align="center" class="ired">属天的奥秘 第4079节</h3>
<h4 align="center"></h4><p><strong>4079.</strong>“他若说，有点的作你的工价，羊群所生的都有点”表祂的自由，以及主在祂的自由中取了那些事物，甚至取了附于这些良善的邪恶。这从内义上这事的状态清楚可知，即：祂有改变工价的自由，并由此在祂的自由中取那些事物。所指的甚至是附于良善的邪恶，这一点从“点”的含义明显看出来，“点”是指与邪恶混杂的良善（参看<a href="3993.htm">3993</a>，<a href="3995.htm">3995</a>，<a href="4005.htm">4005</a>节）。</p>

<p align="center"><b>Potts(1905-1910) 4079</b></p><p><b>4079.</b>
If he said thus, The speckled shall be thy reward, then all the flock bore speckled. That this signifies His freedom, and that in His freedom those things were taken by the Lord, even to evils adjoined 
to the goods, is evident from the state of the matter in the internal sense, which is that He had freedom to change the reward, and thus that in His freedom those things were taken. That these were 
taken even to evils that were adjoined to the goods, is evident from the signification of the "speckled," as being goods with which evils are mingled (see n. 3993, 3995, 4005). </p>

<p align="center"><b>Elliott(1983-1999) 4079</b></p><p><b>4079.</b>
'If he said thus: The speckled will be your wages, then all the flocks bore speckled' means His freedom, and that in His freedom the Lord adopted those things - even evils that were linked to the goods. 
This is clear from the state of the matter in the internal sense, which is that He had the freedom to change the wages, and in so doing that in His freedom He adopted those things. That even evils 
linked to the goods are meant is clear from the meaning of 'the speckled' as good with which evils have been mingled, dealt with in <a href="3993.htm">3993</a>, <a href="3995.htm">3995</a>, <a href="4005.htm">4005</a>. </p>

`Si sic dicebat, Punctata erit merces tua, et pepererunt omnes greges punctata': quod significet liberum Ejus, et quod ii libero Ejus sumerentur illa a Domino, haec quoad mala adjuncta bonis, constat 
ex statu rei in sensu interno, qui est liberum Ei fuerit constat ex statu rei in sensu interno, qui est quod mutare mercedem, et sic quod in libero Ejus desumpta sint illa; quod haec quoad mala 
adjuncta bonis, constat ex significatione `punctatorum' quod sint bona cum quibus mixta mala, de qua n. 3993, 3995, 4005. </p>
