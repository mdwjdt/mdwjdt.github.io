Verse 23. And Abraham took Ishmael his son, and all that were born in his house, and all that were bought with his silver, every male among the men of Abraham's house, and circumcised the flesh of their 
foreskin in the selfsame day, as God spoke with him. "Abraham took Ishmael his son," signifies those who are truly rational; "and all that were born in his house, and all that were bought with his 
silver, and every male among the men of Abraham's house," signifies here as before those who are within the church, with whom the truths of faith are being conjoined with goods; "and circumcised the 
flesh of their foreskin," signifies their purification and righteousness from the Lord; "in the selfsame day," signifies the state that has been spoken of; "as God spoke with him" signifies in accordance 
with the perception. </p>

Verse 23 And Abraham took Ishmael his son, and all born in his house, and everyone purchased with his silver, every male among the men (vir) of Abraham's house, and he circumcised the flesh of their 
foreskin on that same day, just as God had spoken to him. </p>
<p>'Abraham took Ishmael his son' means those who are truly rational. 'And all born in his house, and everyone purchased with his silver, and 
every male among the men of Abraham's house' means here, as previously, those inside the Church in whom truths of faith have been joined to goods. 'And he circumcised the flesh of their foreskin' means 
their purification and righteousness from the Lord. 'On that same day' means that state which has been spoken of. 'Just as God had spoken to him' means according to perception. </p>

Vers. 23.  Et accepit Abraham Jishmaelem filium suum, et omnes natos domus suae, et omnem emptionem argenti sui, omnem masculum in viris domus Abrahami, et circumcidit carnem praeputii eorum, in eodem 
die hoc, quemadmodum locutus cum illo Deus. `Accepit Abraham Jishmaelem filium suum' significat illos qui vere rationales sunt: `et omnes natos domus suae, et omnem emptionem argenti sui, et omnem 
masculum in viris domus Abrahami' significat, hic ut prius, illos qui intra Ecclesiam quibus vera fidei conjunguntur bonis: `et circumcidit carnem {1} praeputii eorum' significat purificationem et justitiam 
eorum a Domino: `in eodem die hoc' significat statum illum de quo dictum: `quemadmodum locutus cum illo Deus' significat secundum perceptionem. 	@1 i omnem AI.$ </p>
