<h3 align="center" class="ired">属天的奥秘 第5180节</h3>
<h4 align="center"></h4><p><strong>5180.</strong>有些魔鬼和灵人会在头部引起一种吸出或抽出，他们以在发生吸出或抽出的点上感到疼痛的方式如此行。我曾体验过这种明显的吸出感，就好像有一层膜正在被吸出。我怀疑其他人能否承受这种痛苦；不过，我已经习惯了这种体验，最终也就能承受而感觉不到疼痛了。遭受吸出的主要地方是我的头顶，从那里扩散到左耳区域，还扩散到左眼区域。朝眼睛扩散是由灵人造成的，朝耳朵扩散是由魔鬼造成的。这些魔鬼和灵人属于乳糜池和乳糜导管的区域，乳糜从周围各个地方被吸入此处，尽管同时有其它乳糜从这里被输送出去。还有些魔鬼和灵人以几乎相同的方式在我脑袋里面行动，只是没有如此大的吸出力。我被告知，他们就是对应大锅饭微细乳糜的人；这种微细乳糜被输送至大脑，在那里与新的动物本性混合，以便被送至心脏。一开始，我看见那些在外边行动的人在前面稍向左一点，但后来又看见他们更高的位置处；这使我意识到他们的区域从鼻隔膜那个层面向上延伸到左耳那个层面。<br />构成这个区域的人有两种，有的相当谦逊，而有的却厚颜无耻。最谦逊的，是那些渴望知道人们的想法，目的是吸引他们，并与他们结缘的人；因为人若知道别人的想法，也就知道了他的秘密和内心感受，而这些会将二者联结起来；最终目的是交往和友谊。这些谦逊的灵人只想知道人里面好的东西，并探究它们，了解更多信息，对其它的一切则给出一个好的解释。那些厚颜无耻的灵人也渴望知道别人的想法，并千方百计查明，但他们的目的是利用或伤害这些人。他们因存有这种渴望和努力，所以会将别人的心思牢牢锁定在他们自己想知道的事情上，从不让步，并在如此行时向他表示爱意和赞许。他们利用这种方式甚至能引出他的秘密想法。在来世，他们在社群里仍以同样的方式行事，只是更巧妙了。在那里，他们也不允许别人偏离自己心中的任何想法；事实上，他们还会助长这种想法，由此将这种想法从他身上引诱出来。结果，利用这种方式，他们以后可以说便抓住了别人的把柄，将他们置于自己的控制之下，让他们服从自己的意志；因为他们知道其他人的邪恶是什么。然而，这些灵人却在游荡的灵人中间，时常受到惩罚。</p>

There are genii and spirits who induce upon the head a kind of suction or drawing, in such a way as to cause pain in the part affected. I noticed a distinct feeling of suction, as if a membrane were 
being very sensibly sucked up. I doubt whether others could have borne this on account of the pain; but having become accustomed to it, I have at last often borne it without pain. The chief place of the 
suction was on the top of the head; and from there it spread toward the region of the left ear, and also toward the region of the left eye. That which spread toward the eye was from spirits, and that 
which spread toward the ear was from genii. Both of these belong to the province of the receptacle and ducts of the chyle, whither also the chyle is drawn from all quarters, although at the same time 
it is driven there. There were also others, who acted within the head in almost the same way, but not with so great a force of suction. It was said that these are they to whom the subtle chyle corresponds, 
which is brought toward the brain and there mingled with new animal spirit, in order that it may be sent down toward the heart. They who acted outwardly were first seen by me on the front side, 
a little to the left, and afterward in a higher position there; so that their region was observed to be from the plane of the septum of the nose rising toward the plane of the left ear. [2] They who 
constitute this province are of two kinds, some being quite modest, while others are wanton. The modest are they who have desired to know men's thoughts for the purpose of alluring and binding them 
to themselves (for one who knows another's thoughts, knows also his secret and inner things, and this effects conjunction), the end being social interaction and friendship. These desire to know only 
what is good in men, exploring this and putting a good interpretation on everything else. But the wanton desire and endeavor in many ways to find out the thoughts of others, with a view either of making 
capital of them or of doing harm; and because they are in such a desire and endeavor, they keep the person's mind fixed on the thing they desire to know, never giving way, yielding an affectionate 
assent, and thus drawing out even the secret thoughts. In the other life they act in a similar manner in the societies there, and still more artfully; for there they do not allow the other to wander from 
his idea, which they also kindle into activity, and thus lure it forth. By this means they afterward hold the others as it were in bonds, and under their control, being privy to their evils. But these 
spirits are among the wandering spirits, and are often chastised. </p>

There are genii and spirits who subject the head to a kind of sucking or drawing out, which they do in such a way that pain is felt at the point where that drawing or sucking out takes place. I have 
experienced a definite sensation of suction, altogether as if a membrane was being sucked out. I doubt whether anyone else could put up with the pain of it; but because I have become accustomed to the 
experience I have at length come to bear it without noticing the pain. The chief place subjected to suction was the top of my head, and from there it spread towards the region of my left ear and also 
towards that of my left eye, the spread towards the eye being caused by spirits and that towards the ear by genii. These genii and spirits belong to the province of the Cistema Chyli and its ducts, to 
which point chyle is drawn from everywhere around, even though other chyle is being sent forth at the same time from there. Besides those genii and spirits there were also others acting inside my head 
in almost the same manner, though not with so great a power of suction. I was told that these are the ones to whom the fine chyle corresponds - the fine chyle which is conveyed towards the brain and 
there mingled with new animal spirit<A name="fntext1"></a><A href="#fn1"><sup>a</sup></a> so as to be sent down to the heart. At first I had seen those acting on the outside in front, a little to the left; but subsequently I saw them in a higher position 
there, which made me realize that their region extended from the level of the septum of the nose upwards to the level of the left ear. Those who constitute this province are of two kinds, for some 
are quite constrained while others are impudent. The constrained are ones who have sought to know other people's thoughts to the end that they might gain those people's interest and become attached 
to them; for a person who knows another's thoughts knows his secret and inner feelings, and these link the two together. The end in view is company and friendship. These constrained spirits desire to 
know simply about the good things, finding out more about these and placing a good interpretation on all else. But the impudent ones have a longing to know - and strive in various ways to fish out - other 
people's thoughts, their end in view being to take advantage of those people or harm them. Now because that kind of longing and striving is present in them they fix another person's mind steadfastly 
on the matter which they themselves wish to know about, showing him affection and approval as they do so. By acting in this way they get out of him even his secret thoughts. They behave in the same 
way in the next life within the communities there, yet in a more expert manner. There too they do not allow another to stray from whatever idea he has in mind; indeed they foster it and thereby get 
it out of him. As a consequence these impudent spirits then have a hold so to speak on others and subject them to their own will; for they know what those others' evils are. These spirits however, being 
some of those who are wanderers, suffer frequent punishment.

Sunt genii et spiritus qui capiti inducunt speciem suctionis seu attractionis, taliter ut locus ubi talis attractio seu suctio existit, doleat; {1}sensus manifestus suctionis apperceptus est, sicut 
assugeretur membrana ad plenum sensum, alii num potuerint sustinere prae dolore, ambigo, sed quia assuefactus hoc tandem absque dolore saepius sustinui; praecipuus suctionis locus fuit in vertice 
capitis, et inde se propagavit versus regionem auris sinistrae, tum versus regionem oculi sinistri; quae versus oculum, fuit a spiritibus; quae versus aurem, fuit a geniis; </p>
<p>hi et illi sunt qui ad 
provinciam cisternae et ductuum chyli pertinent, quo etiam chylus ab undequaque attrahitur, tametsi etiam simul impellitur. Praeterea alii erant qui agebant intus in capite, paene similiter, sed non 
cum tali suctionis vi; dictum quod illi sint, quibus correspondet `chylus subtilis', qui adducitur versus cerebrum, et  {2}ibi commiscetur novo spiritui animali, ut demandetur versus cor. Qui extrinsecus 
agebant, mihi primum visi sunt a parte anteriore paulo sinistrorsum, postea ibi superius, sic ut regio eorum observata sit a plano septi narium versus planum auris sinistrae assurgendo. Qui 
illam provinciam constituunt, sunt duplicis generis, quidam satis modesti sunt, quidam petulantes; {3} modesti sunt qui desideraverunt scire cogitata hominum, ob finem {4} alliciendi et devinciendi' 
illos sibi, qui enim cogitata alterius scit, is arcana ejus et interiora, quae faciunt ut conjungantur; finis est conversatio et amicitia; hi solum bona desiderant scire, et explorant, et reliqua 
bene interpretantur:  at petulantes cupiunt et student pluribus modis expiscari aliorum cogitata, fine vel lucrandi vel nocendi, et quia in tali cupiditate et studio sunt, alterius mentem detinent 
in re quam scire volunt non recedendo, {5}adjungendo etiam assensus ex affectione, sic attrahentes cogitationes etiam arcanas; similiter agunt in altera vita in societatibus ibi, et adhuc solertius, 
ibi nec sinunt divagari {6}alterum a sua idea, quam etiam accendunt, et sic eliciunt; inde postea tenent illos quasi in vinculis, et sub arbitrio, quia conscii malorum:  sed hi spiritus sunt
