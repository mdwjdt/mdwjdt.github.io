<h3 align="center" class="ired">属天的奥秘 第2360节</h3>
<h4 align="center"></h4><p><strong>2360.</strong>罗得称他们为“兄弟”，是因为他出于良善诚恳乞求他们。这从“兄弟”的含义清楚可知。在圣言中，“兄弟”和“邻舍”的含义是一样的。因为人人都应爱邻如己；因此，“兄弟”被如此称呼是出于爱，或也可说，出于良善。以这种方式称呼并问候邻舍来源于天堂，在那里，主是所有人的父亲，并象爱自己的孩子那样爱着所有人；因此，爱是属灵的结合。整个天堂由此可以说类似于从爱与仁所生的一个大家庭（<a href="685.htm">685</a>，<a href="917.htm">917</a>节）。<br />因此，所有以色列人因都代表主的天国，即爱与仁的国度，故他们互称“兄弟”和“同伴”。不过，他们互称“同伴”不是出于爱之善，而是出于信之真。如以赛亚书：<br />各人都帮助自己的同伴，对他的兄弟说，壮胆吧。（以赛亚书<a href="http://39-27.cn/赛41.6.htm">41:6</a>）<br />耶利米书：<br />你们各人要对自己的同伴，各人要对自己的兄弟如此说，耶和华回答什么？耶和华说了什么？（耶利米书<a href="http://39-27.cn/耶23.35.htm">23:35</a>）<br />诗篇：<br />因我弟兄和同伴的缘故，我要说，愿平安在你中间！（诗篇<a href="http://39-27.cn/诗122.8.htm">122:8</a>）<br />摩西书：<br />他不可向他的同伴或兄弟追讨，因为耶和华的豁免已经宣告了。（申命记<a href="http://39-27.cn/申15.2.htm">15:2</a>，<a href="http://39-27.cn/申15.3.htm">3</a>）<br />以赛亚书：<br />我要激动埃及人去攻击埃及人，他们就打起仗来，各人攻击自己的兄弟，各人攻击自己的同伴。（以赛亚书<a href="http://39-27.cn/赛19.2.htm">19:2</a>）<br />耶利米书：<br />各人当谨防自己的同伴，不可信靠弟兄；因为各弟兄尽行欺骗，各同伴都搬弄是非。（耶利米书<a href="http://39-27.cn/耶9.4.htm">9:4</a>）<br />凡属那教会的，都被冠以“弟兄”之名，这可见于以赛亚书：<br />他们必将你们的弟兄从列族中送回，使他们或骑马，或坐车，坐轿，骑骡子，骑独峰驼，到我的圣山耶路撒冷，作为供物献给耶和华。（以赛亚书<a href="http://39-27.cn/赛66.20.htm">66:20</a>）<br />人若象犹太人那样除了字义外一无所知，就会以为此处所指的是雅各的后裔，而非其他人；因此，他们必被那些他们所称呼的外邦人带回耶路撒冷，或骑马，或坐车，坐轿，骑骡子。但是，“弟兄”是指拥有良善的所有人；“马、车和轿”表属于真与善之物；“耶路撒冷”表主的国。<br />摩西书：<br />在你中间如果有一个穷人，又是你的兄弟，你不可硬着心，袖手不帮助你贫穷的弟兄。（申命记<a href="http://39-27.cn/申15.7.htm">15:7</a>，<a href="http://39-27.cn/申15.11.htm">11</a>）<br /><br />你要从你弟兄中立一位王来管理你，不可立不是你弟兄的外邦人治理你。免得他的心向弟兄高傲。（申命记<a href="http://39-27.cn/申17.15.htm">17:15</a>，<a href="http://39-27.cn/申17.20.htm">20</a>）<br /><br />耶和华你的神要从你们弟兄中间给你兴起一位先知像我，你们要听从他。（申命记<a href="http://39-27.cn/申18.15.htm">18:15</a>，<a href="http://39-27.cn/申18.18.htm">18</a>）<br />由上述经文明显可知，犹太人和以色列人全都互称兄弟；但那些通过立约团结起来的人，他们则称其为同伴。然而，由于他们的理解局限于圣言的历史和世俗事务，故他们以为他们互称兄弟，是因为他们全都是一位祖先，或亚伯拉罕的子孙。但是，在圣言中，他们被称为“兄弟”并非因这种情况，而是因他们所代表的良善。而“亚伯拉罕”在内义上表爱本身，也就是主，而非别的什么（<a href="1893.htm">1893</a>，<a href="1965.htm">1965</a>，<a href="1989.htm">1989</a>，<a href="2011.htm">2011</a>节），所以，他们的子孙，也就是“兄弟”，是指那些被良善所主导的人，事实上，是指所有那些被称为邻舍的人。如主在马太福音所教导的：<br />只有一位是你们的老师；你们都是兄弟。（马太福音<a href="http://39-27.cn/太23.8.htm">23:8</a>）<br /><br />凡无缘无故向弟兄动怒的，难免受审判；凡骂弟兄是拉加的，难免公会的审断；所以，你在祭坛上献礼物的时候，若想起弟兄向你怀怨，就把礼物留在坛前，先去同弟兄和好。（马太福音<a href="http://39-27.cn/太5.22.htm">5:22</a>-<a href="http://39-27.cn/太5.24.htm">24</a>）<br /><br />为什么看见你弟兄眼中有刺？怎能对你弟兄说，容我去掉你眼中的刺呢？（马太福音<a href="http://39-27.cn/太7.2.htm">7:2</a>-<a href="http://39-27.cn/太7.4.htm">4</a>）<br /><br />倘若你的弟兄得罪你，你就去趁着只有他和你在一处的时候，指出他的错来。他若听你，你便得了你的弟兄。（马太福音<a href="http://39-27.cn/太18.15.htm">18:15</a>）<br /><br />彼得进前来，对祂说，主啊，我弟兄得罪我，我当饶恕他几次呢？到七次可以吗？（马太福音<a href="http://39-27.cn/太18.21.htm">18:21</a>）<br /><br />你们各人若不从心里饶恕弟兄的罪过，我天父也要这样待你们了。（马太福音<a href="http://39-27.cn/太18.35.htm">18:35</a>）<br />从这些教导清楚可知，各处的所有人因是邻舍，故被称为兄弟。他们被称为“兄弟”，是因为人人都应爱邻如己，以致他们出于爱或良善被如此称呼。由于主是良善本身，并出于良善看待所有人，在至高意义上就是那邻舍自己（Himself the Neighbour），故祂也称他们为“兄弟”，如约翰福音：<br />耶稣对马利亚说，你往我弟兄那里去。（约翰福音<a href="http://39-27.cn/约20.17.htm">20:17</a>）<br />马太福音：<br />王回答他们说，我实在告诉你们，这些事你们做在我弟兄中一个最小的身上，就是做在我身上了。（马太福音<a href="http://39-27.cn/太25.40.htm">25:40</a>）<br />由此清楚可知，“兄弟”是表达爱的一个术语。</p>

<p align="center"><b>Potts(1905-1910) 2360</b></p><p><b>2360.</b>
That Lot calls them "brethren" because it is from good that he exhorts them, is evident from the signification of a "brother." In the Word "brother" signifies the same as "neighbor," for the reason that 
everyone ought to love his neighbor as himself; thus brethren were so called from love; or what is the same, from good. This manner of naming and addressing the neighbor comes from the fact that in 
heaven the Lord is the Father of all and loves all as His children; and thus that love is spiritual conjunction. From this the universal heaven resembles as it were one family derived from love and 
charity (n. 685, 917).  [2] Therefore as all the sons of Israel represented the Lord's heavenly kingdom, that is, the kingdom of love and charity; among each other they were called "brethren," and also 
"companions;" but the latter, that is, "companions," not from the good of love, but from the truth of faith; as in Isaiah: </p>
<p>     They help every man his companion, and he saith to his brother, Be of 
good courage (Isa. 41:6). In Jeremiah: </p>
<p>     Thus shall ye say every man to his companion, and every man to his brother, What hath Jehovah answered? and what hath Jehovah spoken? (Jer. 23:35). In 
David: </p>
<p>     For my brethren and companions' sakes I will say, Peace be within thee (Ps. 122:8). In Moses: </p>
<p>     He shall not press upon his companion or his brother, because the release of Jehovah hath 
been proclaimed (Deut. 15:2, 3). In Isaiah: </p>
<p>     I will confound Egypt with Egypt, and they shall fight every man against his brother, and every man against his companion (Isa. 19:2). In Jeremiah: </p>
<p> 
    Beware every man of his companion, and trust ye not in any brother; for every brother will utterly supplant, and every companion will slander (Jer. 9:4). [3] That all who were of that church 
were called by the one name "brethren," see in Isaiah: </p>
<p>     They shall bring all your brethren out of all the nations for an offering unto Jehovah, upon horses, and in chariots, and in litters, and 
upon mules, and upon dromedaries, to the mountain of My holiness, Jerusalem (Isa. 66:20). They who know nothing beyond the sense of the letter, as was the case with the Jews, believe that no others 
are signified than the posterity of Jacob; thus that they will be brought back to Jerusalem upon horses, and in chariots, and in litters, and upon mules, by those whom they call the Gentiles. But by the 
"brethren" are meant all who are in good; and by the "horses," " chariots," and "litters," the things which are of truth and good; and by "Jerusalem" the Lord's kingdom.  [4] In Moses: </p>
<p>     When 
there shall be among thee a needy one of one of thy brethren, in one of thy gates, thou shalt not harden thy heart, and shalt not shut thy hand from thy needy brother (Deut. 15:7, 11). Again: </p>
<p>     From 
among thy brethren thou shalt set a King over thee; thou mayest not put over thee a foreigner, who is not thy brother, and his heart shall not be lifted up above his brethren (Deut. 17:15, 20). Again: </p>
<p> 
    A prophet from the midst of thee, of thy brethren, like unto me, Jehovah thy God will raise up unto thee; him shall ye obey (Deut. 18:15, 18). [5] From all this it is evident that the Jews 
and Israelites all called one another brethren; but those united by covenant they called companions. Yet as they understood nothing beyond the historical and worldly things of the Word, they believed 
that they called one another brethren because they were all sons of one father, or of Abraham; yet they were not called "brethren" in the Word from this circumstance, but from the good which they represented. 
"Abraham" also, in the internal sense, denotes nothing else than love itself, that is, the Lord (n. 1893, 1965, 1989, 2011), whose sons, consequently those who are "brethren," are those who 
are in good, in fact all those who are called the neighbor; as the Lord teaches in Matthew: </p>
<p>     One is your Master, Christ; all ye are brethren (Matt. 23:8). [6] Again: </p>
<p>     Whosoever is angry with 
his brother without cause shall be in danger of the judgment; whosoever shall say to his brother, Raca, shall be in danger of the council. If thou offer a gift upon the altar, and there remember that 
thy brother hath aught against thee, leave there thy gift before the altar, and go thy way, first be reconciled to thy brother (Matt. 5:22-24). Again: </p>
<p>     Why beholdest thou the mote that is in 
thy brother's eye? How wilt thou say to thy brother, Let me cast out the mote out of thine eye (Matt. 7:2-4)? Again: </p>
<p>     If thy brother sin against thee, go and show him his fault between thee and 
him alone; if he shall hear thee, thou hast gained thy brother (Matt. 18:15). Again: </p>
<p>     Peter coming to Him said, Lord, how oft shall my brother sin against me, and I forgive him? (Matt. 18:21). Again: </p>
<p> 
    So also will My heavenly Father do unto you, if ye from the heart forgive not everyone his brother their trespasses (Matt. 18:35). [7] It is clear from these teachings that all in the universe 
who are the neighbor are called "brethren," and this because everyone ought to love his neighbor as himself, thus they are so called from love or good. And as the Lord is good itself, and regards 
all from good, and is Himself the Neighbor in the highest sense, He also calls them "brethren," as in John: </p>
<p>     Jesus said to Mary, Go to My brethren (John 20:17). And in Matthew: </p>
<p>     The King 
answering shall say unto them, Verily I say unto you, Inasmuch as ye have done it unto one of the least of these My brethren, ye have done it unto me (Matt. 25:40). Thus it is evident that "brother" 
is a term of love. </p>

He calls them 'brothers' because it was from good that he made his appeal. This is clear from the meaning of 'brother', for 'brother' in the Word has the same meaning as 'neighbour', the reason being 
that everyone ought to love his neighbour as himself. Thus 'brothers' were called such out of love, or what amounts to the same, from good. The origin of naming and greeting the neighbour in this way 
lies in heaven where the Lord is Father of all and loves all as His children; and so love is spiritual conjunction. From this the whole of heaven resembles so to speak one family born from love and charity, <a href="685.htm">685</a>, <a href="917.htm">917</a>. </p>
<p></p>
<p><b>[2]</b>
 All the children of Israel therefore, since they represented the Lord's heavenly kingdom, that is, the kingdom of love and charity, were among themselves called 'brothers' and 
also 'companions', though they were called 'companions' not from the good of love but from the truth of faith, as in Isaiah, </p>

<p>In David, </p>
<p>For my brothers'

<p>In Jeremiah, </p>
<blockquote>
Take heed, every one, of his

<p><b>[3]</b>
 The fact that all belonging to that Church were called 
by the one name 'brothers' may be seen in Isaiah, </p>
<blockquote>
They will bring all your brothers from all nations as an offering to Jehovah, on horses, and in chariots, and in covered wagons, and on mules, and 
on dromedaries, to My holy mountain, Jerusalem. <a href="http://bible.gospelcom.net/cgi-bin/bible?passage=Isa%2066:%2020&amp;version=ESV&amp;interface=print&amp;showfn=yes&amp;showxref">Isa 66: 20</a>. 
</blockquote>
<p>People, like the Jews, who know nothing beyond the sense of the letter believe that none else are meant than the descendants of Jacob, and 
also that those descendants will be brought back to Jerusalem on horses, and in chariots, and in covered wagons, and on mules by those whom they call the gentiles. But the word 'brothers' is used to 
mean all who are governed by good, 'horses, chariots, and wagons' to mean the things that belong to truth and good, and 'Jerusalem' the Lord's kingdom. </p>

 From these quotations it is evident that the Jews 
and Israelites all called one another brothers, but allies they called companions. But because they discerned nothing beyond the historical and worldly descriptions of the Word they consequently believed 
that they called one another brothers because they were all children of one forefather, namely Abraham. They were not called brothers in the Word for this reason however but from the good which they 
represented. Furthermore 'Abraham' in the internal sense means nothing else than love itself, that is, the Lord, <a href="1893.htm">1893</a>, <a href="1965.htm">1965</a>, <a href="1989.htm">1989</a>, <a href="2011.htm">2011</a>, whose sons who therefore are brothers - are those who are governed 
by good, all those in fact who are called 'the neighbour', as the Lord teaches in Matthew, </p>
<blockquote>

From all this it is plain that all men everywhere, being the neighbour, are called brothers. They are called 'brothers' because everyone ought to love the neighbour as himself, so that they are 
called such from love or good. And because the Lord is Good itself and views everyone from good, and is Himself the Neighbour in the highest sense of all, He Himself refers to them as 'brothers', as 
in John, </p>
<blockquote>
Jesus said to Mary, Go to My brothers. <a href="http://bible.gospelcom.net/cgi-bin/bible?passage=John%2020:-17&amp;version=ESV&amp;interface=print&amp;showfn=yes&amp;showxref">John 20:-17</a>.

<p>And in Matthew, </p>
<blockquote>
The king will answer them and say, Truly I say to you, insofar as you did it to one of the least of these My brothers 
you did it to Me. <a href="http://bible.gospelcom.net/cgi-bin/bible?passage=Matt%2025:%2040&amp;version=ESV&amp;interface=print&amp;showfn=yes&amp;showxref">Matt 25: 40</a>. 
</blockquote>
<p>From this it is now clear that 'brother' is a term expressive of love. </p>

qui in bono, et per `equos, currus, rhedas' illa quae sunt veri et boni, et per `Hierosolymam' regnum Domini: [4] apud Mosen, 	Cum fuerit inter te egenus de uno fratrum tuorum, in una portarum tuarum,... 
non obfirmabis cor tuum, et non claudes manum tuam e fratre tuo egeno, Deut. xv 7, 11: </p>
<p>apud eundem, 	E medio fratrum tuorum pones super te regem, non poteris dare supra te vinum alienigenam, 
qui non frater tuus ille;... et non efferet {1} se cor (c)ejus prae fratribus suis, Deut. xvii 15, 20: </p>
<p>apud eundem, 	Prophetam e medio tui, de fratribus tuis, sicut me, suscitabit tibi Jehovah Deus 
tuus, Huic oboedietis, Deut. xviii 15, 20. [5] Exinde patet quod judaei et Israelitae se omnes dixerint fratres, (m)foederatos autem socios (n); at quia illi nihil praeter historica et mundana Verbi 
sapiebant, inde fratres se dixisse credebant quia omnes filii unius patris seu Abrahami essent; at in Verbo non dicti sunt fratres inde, sed a bono quod repraesentabant; `Abrahamus' etiam in sensu interno 
non {2} aliud est quam ipse amor, hoc est, Dominus, n. 1893: 1965, 1989, 2011, Cujus filii, et sic fratres, sunt qui in bono, immo omnes qui `proximus' dicuntur, ut Dominus docet apud Matthaeum, 	Unus 
est vester Magister, Christus, omnes vos fratres estis: xxiii 8: </p>
<p>[6] apud eundem, 	Quisquis irascitur fratri suo temere, obnoxius erit judicio quicumque dixerit fratri suo Raka, obnoxius erit 
synedrio... Si obtuleris munus [tuum] super altari, et apud hoc recordatus fueris. quod frater tuus habeat aliquid contra te, relinque ibi munus coram altari, et abi prius 	reconciliare fratri, v 22-24: </p>
<p>apud 
eundem, 	Cur cernis festucam, quae in oculo fratris tui?... quomodo dices fratri tuo, Sine festucam ejiciam ex oculo tuo? vii 2-4: </p>
<p>apud eundem, 	Si peccaverit in te frater tuus, abi et 
argue eum inter te e ipsum solum: si te audiverit, lucratus es fratrem tuum, xviii 15: </p>
<p>apud eundem, 	Accedens Petrus ad Ipsum, dixit, Domine, quoties peccabit in me frater meus, et remittere debeo? 
xviii 21: </p>
<p>apud eundem, 	Sic et Pater Meus caelestis faciet vobis, si non remiseritis suo quisque fratri ex cordibus delicta eorum, xviii 35. [7]	Ex his liquet quod omnes in universo dicantur fratres 
qui proximus et hoc inde quia quisque amare debet proximum ut seipsum, ita ei amore seu bono: et quia Dominus est Ipsum Bonum, et omnes spectat ex bono {3}, et est Ipse Proximus in supremo sensu, Ipse 
quoque illo: vocat fratres, ut apud Johannem, 	Dixit Jesus ad Mariam,... Abi ad fratres Meos, xx 57:  et apud Matthaeum, 	Respondens rex dicet illis, Amen dico vobis, in quantum fecistis uni ex 
his fratribus Meis minimis, Mihi fecistis, xxv 40. Inde nunc constat quod `frater' sit vox amoris. 	@1 efferat.$ 	@2 nec.$ 	@3 After sensu.$ </p>
