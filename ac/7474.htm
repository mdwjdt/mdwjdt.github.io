<h3 align="center" class="ired">属天的奥秘 第7474节</h3>
<h4 align="center"></h4><p><strong>7474.</strong>“不容百姓去”表他们不会离开那些属于属灵教会的人。这从“容去”的含义和以色列人的代表清楚可知：“容去”是指离开；以色列人，即此处的“百姓”，是指那些属于属灵教会的人（参看<a href="6426.htm">6426</a>，<a href="6637.htm">6637</a>，<a href="6862.htm">6862</a>，<a href="6868.htm">6868</a>，<a href="7035.htm">7035</a>，<a href="7062.htm">7062</a>，<a href="7198.htm">7198</a>，<a href="7201.htm">7201</a>，<a href="7215.htm">7215</a>，<a href="7223.htm">7223</a>节）。<br />至于此处以色列人所代表的属灵教会，要知道，它既有一个内在部分，也有一个外在部分；那些处于仁之良善的人处在教会的内在部分，而那些处于信之良善的人则处在教会的外在部分。处于仁之良善的，是那些出于对邻之仁来看待信之真理的人；而处于信之良善的，是那些出于信来看待仁，因而出于属信的服从，也就是说，因为信就是如此吩咐的，而非属仁的情感而行善的人。以色列人在此所代表的，正是这些人，因为他们就是在来世被那些沉浸于虚假的人所侵扰的人。那些处于属仁的情感之人不可能被如此侵扰，事实上，沉浸于虚假和邪恶的灵人无法靠近那些处于这良善的人，因为主就在这良善里面。<br />即便他们受到侵扰，这种侵扰只涉及幻觉和表象，使他们相信非真实的东西是真实的，以及诸如他们的教会当作真理，其实并非真理来教导的那类事物。在来世，这些人愿意弃绝虚假，领受真理；原因是，仁之良善是真理的接受者，因为它热爱并渴慕真理。<br />由于频繁提到侵扰，所以有必要阐明何为侵扰及其性质。侵扰是通过引入反对真理的虚假实现的；不过，对那些遭受这种侵扰的人来说，这些虚假被来自天堂，也就是从主经由天堂而来的一种流注驳倒。那些经历自己的虚假荒凉之人就被保持在这种状态，直到他们吸收信之真理，逐步吸收更内在的真理。他们吸收这些真理到何等程度，就在何等程度上从侵扰当中解脱出来。侵扰不是试探，因为试探的发生伴随着良心的痛苦。经历试探的人被保持在诅咒的状态，这会给他们带来痛苦和悲伤。<br />由此明显可知，在来世，那些处于信之良善的人所经历的荒凉是何性质。这些荒凉是虚假的荒凉。但对那些未处于信之良善，只是处于记忆中的某个信之真理，过着一种邪恶生活的人来说，荒凉是真理的荒凉。那些经历虚假荒凉的人逐渐吸收信与仁之真理与良善；而那些经历真理荒凉的人则逐渐脱去真理，披上属于他们生活的邪恶。由此可见在圣言中，荒凉和荒废是什么意思。</p>

And he did not let the people go. That this signifies that they would not leave those who were of the spiritual church is evident from the signification of "letting go," as being to leave; and from the 
representation of the sons of Israel, here "the people," as being those who are of the spiritual church (see n. 6426, 6637, 6862, 6868, 7035, 7062, 7198, 7201, 7215, 7223). [2] As regards the spiritual 
church, which is here represented by the sons of Israel, be it known that it is internal and external; and that those are in the internal church who are in the good of charity, and that those are 
in the external church who are in the good of faith. Those are in the good of charity who from charity toward the neighbor see the truths which are of faith; but those are in the good of faith who from 
faith look to charity, thus who do what is good, not from the affection of charity, but from the obedience of faith, that is, because it has been so commanded. It is these who are here properly represented 
by the sons of Israel, for these are they who in the other life are infested by those who are in falsities. Those who are in the affection of charity cannot be so infested, for the spirits who 
are in falsities and evils cannot approach those who are in this good, because the Lord is in this good. If these are infested, it is merely in respect to the fallacies and appearances through which 
they have believed what is not true to be true, and also in respect to such things as the doctrine of their church has taught for truths, which yet are not truths. Such in the other life willingly reject 
falsities and receive truths, because the good of charity is recipient of truth, for it loves and desires it.  [3] As infestations have been so often mentioned, it is to be told what they are, 
and what is their nature. Infestations are effected by means of injections of falsity against truths, and these falsities are refuted in those who are being infested, by means of an influx from heaven, 
that is, through heaven from the Lord. In such a state are those held who are in vastation in respect to falsities, until they are imbued with the truths which are of faith, and by degrees with interior 
truths; and insofar as they are imbued with these truths, so far they are liberated from infestation. Infestations are not temptations, for temptations take place with anguish of conscience, those 
who are in temptations being kept in a state of condemnation, and hence of anguish and grief. [4] From all this it is evident what is the nature of the vastations in the other life in which are those 
who are in the good of faith. These vastations are vastations of falsity. But vastations with those who have not been in the good of faith, but in some truth of faith in the memory, while in a life 
of evil, are vastations of truth. Those who are vastated in respect to falsities, become successively imbued with the truths and goods of faith and charity; but those who are vastated in respect to truths, 
successively put off truths, and put on the evils which have been of their life. From all this it can be seen what is meant in the Word by "vastations" and "desolations." </p>

<p align="center"><b>Elliott(1983-1999) 7474</b></p><p><b>7474.</b>
'And did not send the people away' means that they did not leave those who belonged to the spiritual Church. This is clear from the meaning of 'sending away' as leaving; and from the representation of 
the children of Israel, to whom 'the people' refers here, as those who belong to the spiritual Church, dealt with in <a href="6426.htm">6426</a>, <a href="6637.htm">6637</a>, <a href="6862.htm">6862</a>, <a href="6868.htm">6868</a>, <a href="7035.htm">7035</a>, <a href="7062.htm">7062</a>, <a href="7198.htm">7198</a>, <a href="7201.htm">7201</a>, <a href="7215.htm">7215</a>, <a href="7223.htm">7223</a>. </p>
<p></p>
<p><b>[2]</b>
 With regard to 
the spiritual Church, represented here by the children of Israel, it should be recognized that it has an internal part and an external part, and that those people are in the internal part of the Church 
who are governed by the good of charity, while those are in the external part who are governed by the good of faith. People governed by the good of charity are those who out of charity towards the 
neighbour behold the truths of faith, whereas people governed by the good of faith are those who out of faith look towards charity. Thus the latter do good not out of affection belonging to charity but 
out of obedience belonging to faith, that is, because they are commanded to do it. These are precisely the ones who are represented here by the children of Israel, since they are the ones who are molested 
in the next life by those steeped in falsities. People who are governed by affection belonging to charity cannot be molested in the same way, for spirits who are steeped in falsities and evils 
cannot go near those governed by that good because the Lord is within that good. If they do suffer molestation, it involves only the illusions and appearances which have led them to believe things to 
be true which are not actually true, and such things as were presented by the teachings of their Church as truths but are not in fact truths. In the next life those people willingly reject falsities and 
accept truths, the reason being that the good of charity is receptive of truth because it loves it and is desirous of it. </p>
<p></p>
<p><b>[3]</b>
 Since mention is made so many times of molestations what they are and 
what they are like must be stated. Molestations are brought about by introduction of falsity opposed to truths; but those falsities are refuted by an influx from heaven, that is, from the Lord by way 
of heaven, with those suffering such molestation. This kind of state is what those undergoing vastation of their falsities are held in, until they have absorbed the truths of faith, and, stage by stage, 
more internal truths. And in the measure that they have absorbed those truths they are released from molestation. Molestations are not temptations, since temptations when they take place involve 
torment of conscience. For people undergoing temptations are held in a state of damnation, which brings them torment and grief. </p>
<p></p>
<p><b>[4]</b>
 All this shows what the vastations in the next life are like which 
those governed by the good of faith undergo. Those vastations are vastations of falsity. But with those who have not been governed by the good of faith, only by some truth of faith which with them is 
merely factual knowledge, and have led an evil life, the vastations are vastations of truth. Those who undergo vastation of falsities gradually absorb truths and forms of the good of faith and charity, 
whereas those who undergo vastation of truths gradually cast off truths and invest themselves with the evils which have been a feature of the life they led. From all this one may see what is meant 
in the Word by vastations and desolations. </p>

`Et non dimisit populum': quod significet quod non relinquerent illos qui ab Ecclesia spirituali, constat ex significatione `dimittere' quod sit relinquere; et ex repraesentatione `filiorum Israelis,' 
qui hic sunt `populus,' quod sint qui ab Ecclesia spirituali, de qua n. 6426, 6637, 6862, 6868, 7035, 7062, 7198, 7201, 7215, 7223. 	2 Quod Ecclesiam spiritualem, quae hic per `filios Israelis' repraesentatur, 
attinet, sciendum quod illa sit interna et externa; et quod illi sint in Ecclesia interna qui in bono charitatis sunt, {1}et quod illi in Ecclesia externa qui in bono fidei; qui in bono 
charitatis sunt illi qui ex charitate erga proximum vident vera quae fidei; at qui in bono fidei sunt qui ex fide spectant charitatem, ita qui bonum faciunt non ex affectione charitatis sed ex oboedientia 
fidei, hoc est, quia ita mandatum est; hi sunt qui proprie hic per `filios Israelis' repraesentantur, nam hi sunt qui in altera vita infestantur ab illis qui in falsis sunt; qui enim in affectione 
charitatis sunt non ita infestari possunt, nam spiritus qui in falsis et malis sunt non possunt accedere ad illos qui in bono illo sunt, {2}quia Dominus est in illo bono; si hi infestantur, fit solum 
quoad fallacias et apparentias per quas crediderunt verum esse quod non verum est, tum quoad talia quae doctrina Ecclesiae illorum pro veris docuit, quae tamen non vera sunt; (x)illi in altera vita 
libenter rejiciunt falsa ac recipiunt vera, ex causa quia bonum charitatis est recipiens veri, quia amat (d)illud et desiderat illud. 	3 Quia infestationes toties nominatae sunt, dicendum est quid sunt 
et quales: infestationes fiunt per injectiones falsi contra vera, {3} et falsa illa per influxum e caelo, hoc est, per caelum a Domino, apud illos qui infestantur, refelluntur; in tali statu tenentur 
illi qui in vastatione sunt quoad falsa, usque dum imbuerunt vera quae fidei, et per gradus vera interiora; et quantum {4} imbuerunt haec vera, tantum ab infestatione liberantur.  Infestationes non 
sunt tentationes, nam tentationes fiunt cum angore conscientiae; qui enim in tentationibus sunt tenentur in statu damnationis, inde illis angor et dolor {5}. 	4 Ex his patet quales sunt vastationes 
in altera vita, {6}in quibus sunt qui in bono fidei; {7}hae vastationes sunt vastationes falsi; at vastationes apud illos qui {8}non in bono fidei fuerunt, sed in aliquo vero fidei scientifice, at in 
vita mali, sunt vastationes veri; qui vastantur quoad falsa imbuunt successive vera et bona fidei et charitatis; at qui vastantur quoad vera exuunt successive vera, (c)ac induunt mala quae fuerunt vitae 
illorum; ex his constare potest quid in Verbo intelligitur per vastationes et desolationes. 	@1 at$ 	@2 nam$ 	@3 i quae sunt apud illos qui infestantur,$ 	@4 i sic$ 	@5 i; at infestationes fiunt
